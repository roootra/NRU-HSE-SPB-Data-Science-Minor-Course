{"description": "Nothing dates a movie quite as much as a roller-skating blonde in white shorts and a tube top.Midnight Madnessopens with exactly that and quickly follows with a scene in which a student counselor reassures a romantically nervous freshman with the line, \"Flynch, you could be a real Burt Reynolds, I know you could.\" Ah, nostalgia. Made on the cusp of the '80s, afterAnimal Housebut beforePorky's, Disney's college comedy gained a considerable following, thanks to countless screenings on HBO during the Reagan administration. Like all the best cult movies, it's awful, but compelling nonetheless. This is a film in which all the nerds look alike, the jocks have names such as Armpit, and you get to see fat twins shake their abundant disco booties. The plot revolves around an all-night scavenger hunt, with five teams of competing students racing around Los Angeles solving clues and getting into all sorts of amusing scrapes, including a visit to the Pabst brewery that will have you humming ancient advertising songs for days. David Naughton, who went on to star inAn American Werewolf in London, is our hero, but the real fun comes from Stephen Furst as the mean and chubby rich kid and the legendary &uuml;ber-nerd Eddie Deezen as Wesley.  Michael J. Fox makes his film debut as Naughton's troubled but feisty kid brother, and the eagle-eyed viewer may even spot Paul Reubens in a tiny role. Being a Disney film that was released beforePorky'smade shower scenes an integral part of campus comedies, this is a curiously innocent movie--just watch how long it takes the teams to decipher the clue, \"Look between the two giant melons.\" Nevertheless,Midnight Madnessis 112 minutes of undemanding, cheesy fun for anyone who remembers the last days of disco. It makesAnimal Houselook like Chekhov, but watch it with a group of friends, and perhaps a little Pabst Blue Ribbon, and you'll have a hoot.--Simon Leake", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 412416}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.22, "brand": "", "asin": "0764005553", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51TNSHP1F5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Midnight Madness [VHS]"}
{"description": "Woody Allen's feature-film debut,Take the Money and Run, a mockumentary that combines sight gags, sketchlike scenes, and standup jokes at rat-a-tat speed, looks positively primitive compared to his mature work. Primitive, but awfully funny. Allen plays Virgil Starkwell, a music-loving nebbish who turns to a life of crime at an early age and, undaunted by his utter and complete failure to pull off a single successful robbery, continues his unbroken spree of bungled heists and prison breaks even after he marries and raises a family. Narrator Jackson Beck, whose stentorian voice of authority makes a perfect foil for Starkwell's absurd exploits, lobs one droll quip after another with deadpan seriousness. Though spotty, Allen tosses so many jokes into the mix that it hardly matters and when they hit they are often hilarious: the chain gang posing as cousins to their old-woman hostage (\"We're very close,\" Virgil explains to a dim cop), arguing with a dotty movie director who is supposed to be their cover for a bank robbery, Virgil's escape attempt with a bar of soap. Allen spoofs decades of crime films, everything fromI Am a Fugitive from a Chain GangtoBonnie and Clyde, but you don't have to know the movies to enjoy this goofy, sometimes clumsy, but quite clever comedy.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000068DV", "6303011411", "0792846117", "6300216365", "B00003CXGR", "6304785801"], "also_viewed": ["6302697042"]}, "price": 19.9, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 382476}, "asin": "0764003828", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51TBXJ3E20L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Take the Money and Run [VHS]"}
{"description": "Film buffs and critics can argue until their faces turn blue about whether this lavish Dickensian musical deserved the Academy Award for Best Picture of 1968, but the movie speaks for itself on grandly entertaining terms. Adapted from Dickens's classic novel, it's one of the most dramatically involving and artistically impressive musicals of the 1960s, directed by Carol Reed with a delightful enthusiasm that would surely have impressed Dickens himself. Mark Lester plays the waifish orphan Oliver Twist, who is befriended by the pickpocketing Artful Dodger (Jack Wild) and recruited into the gang of boy thieves led by Fagin (played to perfection by Ron Moody). The villainous Bill Sikes (Oliver Reed) casts his long shadow over Oliver and his friends, but the young orphan is still able to find loving care in the most desperate of circumstances. Full of memorable melodies and splendid lyrics,Oliver!is a timeless film, prompting even hard-to-please critic Pauline Kael to call it \"a superb demonstration of intelligent craftsmanship,\" and to further observe that \"it's as if the movie set out to be a tribute to Dickens and his melodramatic art as well as to tell the story of Oliver Twist.\"--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B0000VCZKM", "B000RPCK2E", "B005NFJAZS", "B00G9EOQ8I", "B0001I55TC", "B00000F17A", "B000026FAZ", "B001J4E1CY", "B000002W8R", "B002HK9IDQ", "B000BITV92", "B0000AM6IY", "0780021312", "B000HT3PGU", "B0001WTUJE", "B0045HCJJY", "B00D3K357O", "B0006HBV3W", "B00005JL1P", "B00012FXJ0", "B007P7UF0G", "B00004TVUD", "B00AATV0WS", "B000BYA4HE", "B001PO550A", "B000002SLN", "0792839749", "B0090XLDKY", "6305320802", "B00005AUKE", "B003BZXIA0", "B00AEFY6DI", "B000KJTGHO", "0767827651", "B0007Z0O9U", "B0001US8F8", "B009Z59782", "B00011D1OK", "B00005MEOU", "B0045HCJQM", "B0007939PW", "B000HT3PGK", "B000AP04OM", "B0000549B1", "B001PO54V0", "B001GLX6TY", "B000VKL6RK", "B00004XMTJ", "B000025BD5", "B0009S4IKQ", "B000BT970O", "B000LPR6GA", "B00006RCO3", "B000XJD34I", "B000TPTCP0", "B009NYF2GQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0000VCZKM", "B00E9ZATKI", "B000RPCK2E", "B005NFJAZS"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 371247}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 10.0, "brand": "", "asin": "0767812417", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/517WF2e1VhL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "OLIVER! 30th Tribute Edition"}
{"description": "From the sun-dappled heartland, a young man (Robert Redford, in soft lighting) emerges as maybe the best baseball player anybody's ever seen. On his way to the majors, he is cut down by an enigmatic black widow (Barbara Hershey) and vanishes for many years. When he reemerges, a silent mystery, he lands a spot with the New York team and begins tearing up the league--he's still the natural. Fans of the Bernard Malamud novel will be dismayed at the pure mythical hokum of this film, but baseball fanatics have been known to watch and rewatch this one; after all, it's constructed as a kind of shrine to the national pastime. Barry Levinson (Rain Man) directs the movie with an unabashed devotion to the game, although the film could use more of the realities of chewing tobacco and pine tar. Redford is fine, and Kim Basinger and Oscar-nominated Glenn Close are effective as the women in his life. The crowning touch is the soaring, extraordinary music by Randy Newman, the singer-songwriter turned orchestral composer.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005M20M", "0783235968", "B000068NNT", "630273973X", "6302534372", "6302415853", "6305132666", "0800121600", "6304291698", "B00004RGUU", "6305126062", "630596260X", "B0000399WO", "6301734734", "6303597874", "6302936381", "B00000I1DI", "6303014100", "076780922X", "B0000048ZL", "6300181472", "0792841786", "0790743159", "0792839846", "5559477621", "6302226899", "6302450179", "6302023742", "B0000068ZQ", "630018224X", "6300183513", "630299005X", "B00004RFFA", "B0000068EE", "630150528X", "6300246965", "B00000JGEI", "B000M5BRX2", "6300215695", "6302360978", "6302909023", "6300181154", "6300184927", "0800179552"], "bought_together": ["B00005M20M", "0783235968"], "also_viewed": ["0783235968", "B000003KMM", "B0000399WO", "6300216810"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 348212}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.79, "brand": "", "asin": "0767809262", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51816SHE4HL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Natural [VHS]"}
{"description": "Woody Allen was going through his off-screen scandal with Mia Farrow whenManhattan Murder Mysterywas produced, so Diane Keaton was brought in to fill the role intended for Farrow. The reunion of Keaton and Allen only improves this already enjoyable Allen comedy, since they're so comfortable with each other's neuroses that they're delightfully convincing as a married couple who suspect their neighbor of murdering his wife. Actually, it's Keaton who obsesses about the possible foul play; Woody just wants them to mind their own business. But pretty soon they've recruited their friends (Alan Alda, Anjelica Huston) as amateur sleuths, and the movie turns into a Nancy Drew mystery for sophisticated Manhattanites. With a typical abundance of Woody Allen witticism and some memorable comic suspense, this engaging throwback to vintage Hollywood mysteries is guaranteed to please even the most noncommittal Woody Allen fans, and the Allen-Keaton chemistry is, as always, a genuine pleasure.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005AUJK", "B00AEFYVUQ", "B00008978N", "B00008L3SA", "B000IU37SO", "B00003CY6A", "B00005O06J", "B00005O06M", "B0013D8LC2", "B000AM6P2U", "B00013D580", "6304907729", "B002LMV7RA", "B00005AUJH", "B00004STRD", "B00005O06N", "B00003CXGS", "0792846125", "0792846117", "B00020X88E", "0792846087", "B001DJ7PR8", "B00005O06I", "B00005O06L", "B00005JL81", "B00005AUJO", "B007NYZA0Q", "B001539HQY", "B005MYEQ4U", "0792846095", "B0064NTZKI", "B00005AUJI", "B00005O06K", "B00005AUJE", "0792846060", "B009UTX4M8", "B002LMV7QG", "B00G7QPXUI", "B007NPMQAC", "B00005AUJM", "B006FSRSFQ", "B00005O06O", "B001G9F9IW", "B00006JCMO", "B00K6D1S7A", "B00009Q4W7", "B00IFHY2PE", "B0007XBKP4", "B00G7QPYX4", "B009UTX53Q", "0792846052", "B00441GYRO", "0812978110", "B007NPMMIS", "B00KOW4BOU", "B006P7RA1O", "B00871C09S", "B007NPMRXI", "B00023P4JW", "B0007QJ1XE", "B001D8W7EK", "B00KOW4AZ0", "B00005JL0I", "B00AEFYRJQ", "B004SIP84S", "0780621654", "B000FVQLKM", "B00AEFY0KW", "B00JK5C46E", "B0007QJ1ZW", "B0026ZQJT8"], "bought_together": ["B00005AUJK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005AUJK", "B00AEFYVUQ", "B002LMV7RA", "6304907729"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 17338}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.69, "brand": "Manhattan", "asin": "0767819764", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518B34J685L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Manhattan Murder Mystery"}
{"description": "Bugsyrepresents an almost miraculous combination of director, writer, and star on a project that represents a career highlight for everyone involved. It's one of the best American gangster movies ever made--as good in its own way as any of theGodfatherfilms--and it's impossible to imagine anyone better than Beatty in the movie's flashy title role. As notorious mobster and Las Vegas visionary \"Bugsy\" Siegel, Beatty is perfectly cast as a man whose dreams are greater than his ability to realize them--or at least, greater than his ability to stay alive while making those dreams come true. With a glamorous Hollywood mistress (Annette Bening) who shares Bugsy's dream while pursuing her own upwardly mobile agenda, Bugsy seems oblivious to threats when he begins to spend too much of the mob's money on the creation of the Flamingo casino. Meyer Lansky (Ben Kingsley) and Mickey Cohen (Harvey Keitel) will support Bugsy's wild ambition to a point, after which all bets are off, and Bugsy's life hangs in the balance. From the obvious chemistry of Beatty and Bening (who met and later married off-screen) to the sumptuous reproduction of 1940s Hollywood, every detail in this movie feels impeccably right. Beatty is simply mesmerizing as the man who invented Las Vegas but never saw it thrive, moving from infectious idealism to brutal violence in the blink of an eye. Director Barry Levinson is also in peak form here, guiding the stylish story with a subtle balance of admiration and horror; we can catch Bugsy's Vegas fever and root for the gangster's success, but we know he'll get what he deserves. We might wish that Bugsy had lived to see his dream turn into a booming oasis, but the movie doesn't suggest that we should shed any tears.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00004U103", "B00013RC2U", "B004G7XCRQ", "B0000AMJEK", "B002954A4Q", "B007TBIUSM", "B00000JGHJ", "B000068QPV", "B0000DI87S", "B000E5KQHI", "B00AEBB9NM", "B000EHSVRI", "B000C20VPA", "B0010YVCI4", "B00008RH3L", "B001C0I61M", "B00004XPPB", "B000E8NRBC", "B00CMDPT3Q", "B000P0J09M", "0792838076", "6305297142", "0792846877", "B000GG4Y32", "B0019CUG02", "B000286RP2", "B002EAYDN4", "B004YCKKFK", "B008XTVWMU", "B002QEHPQU", "B004JKS996", "6305428522", "B000C1VAFG", "B0001EFV7C", "B00AEFY7NM", "B0007G89FK", "B00007G1YP", "B00080ZG10", "B001EKP5D2", "B00005JP93", "B008R65XYC", "B00005AA9C", "B00009Y3PV", "B00005T7I1", "B0000AM6JI", "B000N3T0H8", "B004FQX59I", "B00005V9HH", "B00005IA7Y", "B000C20VRS", "0792838068", "B002CPMB9O", "B00CCMKPO0", "B000063K2Q", "B008YAPRQK", "B000ERVKBC", "B002VWNICC", "B000P0J0AG", "B0006OEXTE", "B000NQPZCO", "B0018CMJSU", "B00AEFYTMQ", "B007NE08LM", "B00H9KKGTO", "B0006HBV3C", "B0002V7O5Q", "B00AEBB95K", "B001EIOOV8", "B0006GAOJA", "B00AEFXN9G", "0767830555", "B005S9ELVC", "B004SIP7TE", "B0006GANN2", "B0019UGYK0", "B00441GYPG", "B0009HMTGC", "B0064MT1FI", "B003HE4FAC", "B0003JANSW", "1451635672", "B00E96AZBK", "B000CNESTE", "B000M341QE", "B0006HBLUK", "B00007M57P", "B00005LC4D", "B0001FGBUW", "1467907898", "B007N31YH0", "B007UW9W5U", "B00BMJ7ZKG", "B00FRILRL6", "B00008975Z", "0792844831", "B0000542CB", "1607105829", "B001DW2BJW", "B000AQ69SG", "B00AEFXVOI"], "bought_together": ["B00004U103", "B0000AMJEK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0002V7T0G", "B00004U103", "B00013RC2U", "B000EHSVRI"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 217388}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.74, "brand": "", "asin": "0767818059", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51XE61M6B7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Bugsy"}

{"description": "This sumptuous and moving 1994 film written and directed by Bernard Rose (Candyman) investigates the artistic and romantic passions of one of the greatest composers of all time. Featuring a superb performance by Gary Oldman (Sid and Nancy) as Ludwig van Beethoven,Immortal Belovedis full of uncommonly vivid, rich imagery as it charts the tumultuous life of the deaf child prodigy and his rise to the height of musical achievement. Along the way, he attempts to play mentor to his nephew, attend to his many passionate romances--the most stable one was with a countess (Isabella Rossellini)--and fight bouts of depression and madness that ruled his life and his art. The film is framed around a \"Rosebud\"-type letter found after the composer's death that makes up the crux of the story. Jeroen Krabb&eacute; (The Fugitive), playing Beethoven's lifelong friend, attempts to discover who Beethoven's muse really was, becoming as driven as his friend in discovering the unlikely identity of the composer's \"immortal beloved.\" Through this we gain an insight into the nature of obsession, romance, and the heights and sacrifices of artistic achievement. The film exhibits some extraordinary sound design, and the finale features a magical encapsulation of Beethoven's life and loves set to his \"Ode to Joy.\" As an exciting and passionate journey,Immortal Belovedis its own masterpiece.--Robert Lane", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 614366}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.9, "brand": "", "asin": "0767824407", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515AXXJZF6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Immortal Beloved [VHS]"}

{"description": "Though only a short subject, this groundbreaking documentary remains one  of the most influential and powerful explorations of the Holocaust ever made.  Director Alain Resnais bluntly presents an indictment not only of the Nazis but of the world community, and the film is all the more remarkable for its harsh judgment considering the time in which it was made, less than a decade after the end of the war, when questions of responsibility were not yet being addressed. Juxtaposing archival clips from the concentration camps across Germany and Poland with the present-day denials of the camps' existence, the film seeks to once and for all expose the horrifying truth of the Final Solution, as well as to address the continuing anti-Semitism and bigotry that existed long after the war's end.

{"description": "The second installment of John Ford's famous cavalry trilogy (which also includesFort ApacheandRio Grande), this meditative Western continues the director's fascination with history's obliteration of the past. It features one of John Wayne's more sensitive performances as Capt. Nathan Brittles, a stern yet sentimental war horse who has difficulty preparing for his impending military retirement. All things considered, he refuses to leave before fulfilling his obligation to the local Indian tribe. It's a film about honor and duty as well as loneliness and mortality. And Oscar-winner Winton C. Hoch beautifully photographs it in Remington-like Technicolor tones (you've never seen such stunning cloud-covered skies). The combination of melancholy and farce (Victor McLaglen makes a perfect court jester) evokes comparisons to Shakespeare. Best of all, the scene in which Wayne fights back tears when receiving a gold watch from his troops is unforgettably bittersweet. If you view the whole trilogy, it actually makes sense to save this for last.--Bill Desowitz", "related": {"also_bought": ["1555265952", "6301325508", "6304457316", "6302320496", "6303192254", "6300268470", "6301736303", "6301797922", "630197705X", "6304457308", "6304457278", "6301802330", "6300988473", "0792110188", "6300268799", "6303026672", "6300269884", "6300183041", "B00008AOTO", "B000O599NA", "6303471730", "6301736362", "6300267830", "6301967488", "6301325478", "B00A2H9P98", "6300208281", "B000051S3Z", "6301978765", "6301977165", "630150528X", "6303039588", "6303599052", "6300269043", "6300267938", "6301805518", "6301586042", "6300215733", "1569942072", "6301798759", "B00004RFFA", "0792838556", "6301232305", "079284517X", "6301971558", "6300184951", "B00004TZS4", "6300181111", "6303072798", "6302041090"], "bought_together": ["6301325508", "1555265952"], "also_viewed": ["B000O599NA", "B0082LUFA4", "1555265952", "B0047BXR94", "6301325508", "B000O599ZS", "B009YX8MSG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 370830}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.85, "brand": "", "asin": "0780621832", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51FXAMBK79L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "She Wore a Yellow Ribbon [VHS]"}

{"description": "Repeated viewings can't dispel the shock of the final scene in this classic 1941 romantic mystery--a brief but disorienting confrontation that suddenly inverts the heroine's mounting conviction that she's married a murderer, forcing us to reconsider virtually every scene and line of dialogue that's preceded it. It's a masterful coup de grace for director Alfred Hitchcock, who has built a puzzle around the corrosive power of suspicion, threaded with deft ambiguities that toy with dramatic conventions and character archetypes in nearly every frame.As embodied by Joan Fontaine, who nabbed an Oscar in this second outing with the director, Lina McLaidlaw is a buttoned-up, bookish heiress whose prim exterior conceals longings for a more engaged emotional life. Her solution materializes in the darkly handsome Johnnie Aysgarth, a gambler, womanizer, and spendthrift who flirts, then pursues, and soon marries her. As Aysgarth, Cary Grant is both irresistible and sinister, capable of deceit and petty theft, as well as grander designs on his bride's impending fortune. Lina's passion for Johnnie is clouded by each new revelation about his apparent dishonesty, from clandestine gambling to real estate development schemes; more troubling are clues implicating him in the death of his best friend, and the prospect that Johnnie may be slowly poisoning Lina herself. By the time we see him ascending a darkened staircase with a suspicious glass of milk, an image made all the more indelible through the spectral glow the director captures in the glass, the evidence seems damning indeed.In fact, even as Hitchcock stacks the deck against Johnnie, and takes full advantage of Grant's skill at conveying such menace, the director also dots his landscape with visual clues to Lina's own neurotic (and erotic) obsessions.

{"description": "Written by Carl Foreman (who was later blacklisted during the anticommunist hearings of the '50s) and superbly directed by Fred Zinnemann, this 1952 classic stars Gary Cooper as just-married lawman Will Kane, who is about to retire as a small-town sheriff and begin a new life with his bride (Grace Kelly) when he learns that gunslinger Frank Miller (Ian MacDonald) is due to arrive at high noon to settle an old score. Kane seeks assistance from deputies and townsfolk, but soon realizes he'll have to stand alone in his showdown with Miller and his henchmen. Innovative for its time, the suspenseful story unfolds in approximate real time (from 10:40 a.m. to high noon in an 84-minute film), and many interpreted Foreman's drama as an allegorical reflection of apathy and passive acceptance of Senator Joseph McCarthy's anticommunist campaign. Political underpinnings aside, this remains a milestone of its genre (often referred to as the first &quot;adult&quot; Western), and Cooper is flawless in his Oscar-winning role.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792107683", "0792106989", "630150528X", "6301977297", "6304457316", "0783221347", "6300267938", "B000006N70", "0792837371", "B001KO1BCQ", "6300184951", "0783222955", "B003MG6FJY", "630197705X", "0792110188", "079284517X", "6300215741", "B00AEFYTEY", "6300181340", "6300268470", "B000MGTQ7K", "0783235607", "6301971558", "B0049985XW", "1558807780", "6302640504", "6300183513", "6303686796", "630442972X", "6301973410", "B0013D8L8Q", "6303402070", "B000XR9L50", "0800132009", "6300273210", "B000M7BEPQ", "B000059TFW", "0790743159", "B005AMJ31U", "B0035JHYJI", "0790743213", "6301978536", "630021639X", "0800113055", "6303057225", "6302360978", "6304359721", "B00003OSTO", "6300215644", "0790743531", "6300216500", "6301802330", "B00004RFFA", "6300216195", "630018224X", "0792110269", "079284520X", "6304039522", "0783235593", "0790758474", "6301599896", "6300215660", "6302484421", "1558804226", "6304429711", "6301973259", "6300183211", "0783236352", "B00005QATY", "6304071876", "6301797957", "0800104803", "6303072747", "6304359705", "0800100832", "6303953425", "6300181421", "630248443X", "6303027016", "6301734734", "0792837096", "6300267970", "0792107128", "6300213838", "6300216012", "6300216233", "6302484405", "0792102320", "6301586026", "0792838556", "6300183580", "6302054982", "0784011923", "6304039530", "630396155X", "B000GX7MMA", "6301969294", "6302484448", "B000005PPB"], "bought_together": ["0792107683", "0792106989"], "also_viewed": ["0800116917"]}, "price": 9.95, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 244368}, "asin": "0782008348", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4118FFB44JL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "High Noon [VHS]"}
{"description": "Rock Hudson and Jane Wyman were so successful in Douglas Sirk'sMagnificent Obsessionthat they reteamed for this, his first melodrama masterpiece. Young hunk Rock is a strapping son of mother nature, a gardener who woos middle-aged, middle class widow Wyman to the snooty disapproval of her conservative social circle and embarrassment of her self-centered children. Wyman discovers a new life with his open-armed friends and back-to-nature lifestyle, but struggles with life-changing decisions in the face of social pressure and vicious gossip. Living the Henry Thoreau dream, Rock inhabits his personal Walden in a rustic country cabin by a bubbling brook, a dream house lit by a giant picture window overlooking an idyllic countryside where deer pose just outside the window. Wyman's elegant but sterile suburban home transforms into a tomb when she sacrifices her love for the \"good name\" of her children, and the lonely widow sees her future in the pale, colorless reflection of her TV screen. But don't despair just yet: Sirk's heroines are dynamic and resourceful and no Sirk melodrama ends without a heart-tugging, over-the-top twist. German director Rainer Werner Fassbinder, who championed Sirk as a master and a mentor, remade the film asAli: Fear Eats the Souldecades later.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300183890", "6301045750", "B00008CMRN", "6301971736", "6300183874", "6301963644", "B000005XPV", "B00009IB1F", "6301978536", "6302725542", "630266232X", "6301971310", "6301973410", "B00000IBME", "0792837207", "6303391931", "6301773586", "6302023769", "0792840836", "6301628454", "6301965620", "6300269434", "0792845951", "079284517X", "6301670159", "6303393985", "6303562248", "6301968891", "6302000661", "6301969081", "6301967410", "630290899X", "6302308208", "B000003KE0"], "bought_together": ["6300183890", "6301045750"], "also_viewed": ["6300183890", "B000JJRBFY", "B00J2PQYG8"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 243382}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 29.99, "brand": "", "asin": "0783215096", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51WQ1QW6QZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "All That Heaven Allows [VHS]"}
{"description": "What if you were asked to investigate a murder in which you were the prime suspect? From this seemingly impossible notion comes a grandly entertaining nail-biter. Charles Laughton plays the punctuality obsessed, slave-driving head of a publishing empire who won't let his crime magazine's star editor (Ray Milland) take a day off to spend with his family. The overworked Milland, having just upset a delayed honeymoon trip for the umpteenth time, goes on a sorrow-drowning, bar-hopping bender with a mysterious woman who, it turns out, is Laughton's mistress. Later that night after Milland has gone home, Laughton murders her, and the next day he assigns Milland to investigate, since a number of clues point to her having spent time with another man that night. Milland, then, must not only find the real murderer but sidetrack the investigation away from himself. That both characters are solving the crime in tandem yet unwittingly working toward pinning the murder on each other is at the heart ofThe Big Clock's labyrinthine brilliance. Helping bring out the dark humor in this adaptation of Kenneth Fearing's noir novel (included in the Library of America's Crime Novels collection) is Elsa Lanchester as a high-strung painter who can sketch the prime suspect (Milland), a time-bomb plot device that only adds to the already unbearable suspense. This is a taut, lean thriller, superbly handled by director John Farrow, who never fails to remind his audience through repeated use of clocks, timepieces, and watches that all too often in our lives that ticking sound is the enemy. This was remade in 1987 with Kevin Costner asNo Way Out.--Robert Abele", "related": {"also_bought": ["1558807780", "6302413435", "6304359705", "0783236352", "6302375819", "6304152442", "6302413451", "6302011019", "630266232X", "6301966430", "6300183890", "6301005740", "6301987845", "6301973410", "B000003KE0", "6302375827", "0790743531", "6303011403", "6301976207", "6302787033", "6304153163", "6302760003", "6302801133", "6303391923", "6304308418", "6302305942", "6300208133", "6300183912", "079074886X"], "bought_together": ["6304152442"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 383385}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.22, "brand": "", "asin": "0783217390", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51D7RF9228L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Big Clock [VHS]"}
{"description": "In the vastly overrated 1998 bookEasy Riders, Raging Bulls, author Peter Biskind puts the blame for Hollywood's blockbuster mentality at least partially on Steven Spielberg's box-office success with this adaptation of Peter Benchley's bestselling novel. But you can't blame Spielberg for making a terrific movie, whichJawsdefinitely is. The story of a Long Island town whose summer tourist business is suddenly threatened by great-white-shark attacks on humans bypasses the potboiler trappings of Benchley's book and goes straight for the jugular with beautifully crafted, crowd-pleasing sequences of action and suspense supported by a trio of terrific performances by Roy Scheider (as the local sheriff), Richard Dreyfuss (as a shark specialist), and particularly Robert Shaw (as the old fisherman who offers to hunt the shark down). The sequences on Shaw's boat--as the three of them realize that in fact the shark is huntingthem--are what entertaining moviemaking is all about.--Marshall Fine", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005B6ND", "6300183181", "0784011923", "0767825411", "6305814694", "B00000JGEI", "6303148352", "6303506291", "630018403X", "B00000490M", "6300214753", "6304932553", "630442972X", "6300269639", "B0000048S1", "B000005PFL", "6302765536", "6302091632", "6302824729", "6303344224", "6301570723", "6300247171", "B00008WFU5", "6305576173", "6300183467", "0790743213", "6304143184", "6303402348", "1558808221", "6303020089", "B000063UUL", "B00005B238", "6303212379", "B00005A8XX", "0790731436", "0783226152", "0790705141", "6300267881", "B00008WFU4", "6300181340", "630157401X", "6302921058", "6300214060", "6302968143", "1558802258", "0792102320", "6300214087", "6300268993", "B0000BWVBD", "B002GHHHL0", "6301888901", "B00005JKDQ", "6303122647", "6302800420", "6303610811", "6301827732", "6303540082", "6302374189", "0800198395", "6300214435", "6304071876", "6301208773", "B00000IO4G", "B00006G8LB", "B0087ZG7HK", "B00008DZ83", "6300214710", "6300215814", "630220366X", "6304457324", "0800116917", "B000059XY5", "6303212263", "6300216500", "6303236863", "630533577X", "6300213986", "6302415853", "6304935811", "6302820448", "B00004U8P4", "6300214311", "6301798503", "0793927501", "6300214370", "6302787564", "6304288433", "6300182878", "B000003KHS", "6301971809", "B000007OY0", "0790734079", "630336568X", "0790733927", "0790742322", "6301966988", "0764006770", "B000059XVO", "B00023BLXA"], "also_viewed": ["B00008WFU5", "6301792734", "6305814694", "B00005B6ND", "0784011923", "0767825411", "6300214060", "6300183181", "6300247171", "B00005A8XX", "6303506291", "B00006AL1C", "0792151712", "6304539258", "630018403X", "6305363668", "B00008WFU4", "B00000JGEI", "B00078XGO2", "6304117752", "6301574117", "0800116917", "B000005PPB", "B0056BE0SG", "6302091632", "080010367X", "6304143184", "6300216845", "6304539274", "6303148352", "0792158261", "B00000JS61", "0792839846", "6303212379", "0792837614", "0783222955", "0783221347", "0790700506", "6302921058", "6301797906", "6301976983", "6305123616", "6303402070", "6304429274", "1558807780", "B00005JKDQ", "6300214370", "6302936381", "B00000JGEK", "B0000AQZYM", "B00000JXVM", "B0007KTBIU", "0790734079", "6304039522", "6300214753", "B00005NCCP", "B005FHWWXQ", "B0087F7VSY", "B00KDU8HQQ"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 177995}, "asin": "0783216084", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514JQY1K3TL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Jaws [VHS]"}
{"description": "The 1963 film that inspired a popular television series about a chatty,  lovable dolphin gets a sunny makeover in this 1996 update. Elijah Wood plays  Sandy, a bleak adolescent from Chicago struggling with the recent divorce of  his parents and wanting only to immerse himself in familiar comforts.  Instead, Sandy is sent to Coral Key, an island off Australia, to spend a  summer with his Uncle Porter (Paul Hogan), a benevolent old fisherman. The  sights and pleasures of the island, including a pretty neighbor named Kim  (Jessica Wesson), aren't enough to shake off Sandy's gloomy outlook. But when  he meets Flipper while boating with Porter, his morale improves considerably,  then gets another boost when Flipper develops a loyal attachment to him. A  subplot about a crooked charter-boat company dumping toxic waste off the  coast feels like a necessary evil, just to give the screenwriter something to  do. Other than that, the film is quite fun and charming, and Hogan is a  pleasure to see with his cracker-barrel wisdom. Great fun all around for ages 6 and up.--Tom  Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303394345", "6304171277", "B00006FDFG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 428891}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.0, "brand": "", "asin": "0783219148", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518M48CMBZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Flipper [VHS]"}

{"description": "Ranked 34 on the American Film Institute's list of the 100 Greatest American Films,To Kill a Mockingbirdis quite simply one of the finest family-oriented dramas ever made. A beautiful and deeply affecting adaptation of the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by Harper Lee, the film retains a timeless quality that transcends its historically dated subject matter (racism in the Depression-era South) and remains powerfully resonant in present-day America with its advocacy of tolerance, justice, integrity, and loving, responsible parenthood. It's tempting to call this an important &quot;message&quot; movie that should be required viewing for children and adults alike, but this riveting courtroom drama is anything but stodgy or pedantic. As Atticus Finch, the small-town Alabama lawyer and widower father of two, Gregory Peck gives one of his finest performances with his impassioned defense of a black man (Brock Peters) wrongfully accused of the rape and assault of a young white woman. While his children, Scout (Mary Badham) and Jem (Philip Alford), learn the realities of racial prejudice and irrational hatred, they also learn to overcome their fear of the unknown as personified by their mysterious, mostly unseen neighbor Boo Radley (Robert Duvall, in his brilliant, almost completely nonverbal screen debut). What emerges from this evocative, exquisitely filmed drama is a pure distillation of the themes of Harper Lee's enduring novel, a showcase for some of the finest American acting ever assembled in one film, and a rare quality of humanitarian artistry (including Horton Foote's splendid screenplay and Elmer Bernstein's outstanding score) that seems all but lost in the chaotic morass of modern cinema.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305123616", "6301797906", "6304119046", "630150528X", "6300183513", "6300181340", "0800132009", "6301720555", "6301975987", "079284517X", "6301971736", "B000006GCU", "0783235607", "6300181286", "0800100832", "6300270971", "0792839846", "6301976932", "6302909023", "6301977297", "6301976983", "0783221347", "6300182304", "6300183629", "6304117752", "6303560040", "6304429274", "0782008348", "6300181278", "6301976061", "1558807780", "6302226899", "6304151306", "6303257844", "0790743159", "0783236352", "6301586026", "1569942072", "6300214060", "B000006N70", "0800125762", "0790733935", "6302150620", "6303168507", "6301964012", "B00005LCBP", "6301773586", "B002NZK5VO", "630197350X", "B007Y1NR1W", "0790748169", "0446310786", "6300267857", "B00066FBQG", "0792133153", "B00AEBB932", "6304259131", "B00001OWYM", "6303020089", "B00003UCB0", "630310696X", "630021639X", "6301797957", "B00005NQGQ", "079212569X", "0767825616", "6301978633", "B00004TYS8", "6305718792", "0792108868", "6305050023", "6304383177", "B000EO7AIC", "0792108280", "6301661729", "6302529484", "6304457383", "0790731975", "6303382940", "0792844645", "0792116887", "6303269834", "0792837630", "6302843200", "630197333X", "B00003CXFU", "6300269310", "6301977815", "6300267970", "B000005PFL", "0782006779", "6303313345", "6300214435", "6301670159", "B000003KHS", "630027120X", "6304429711", "B0000040EO", "630157401X"], "bought_together": ["6305123616"], "also_viewed": ["0446310786", "6305123616", "0783235607", "6302226899", "0783221347", "6300215814", "0800100832", "0783216084", "6302909023", "630150528X", "0792839846", "0800132009", "6304117752", "0792837096", "B000FQJAIW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 157532}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.63, "brand": "Universal International Home Video", "asin": "0783222955", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51C084T8V7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]"}
{"description": "\"This is going to be the last big score, I promise.\" Famous last words--uttered by crack thief Doc McCoy to his wife--that set forth a whirlpool of deception and violence in Roger Donaldson's 1994 remake ofThe Getaway. Bailed out of a Mexican jail by shady businessman Jack Benyon (James Woods) in order to hit an Arizona dog track for him, Doc (Alec Baldwin) and Carol (Kim Basinger) flee for south of the border when the robbery goes wrong, with the million-dollar loot in tow. Following close behind are Benyon's men and Doc's double-crossing partner Rudy (Michael Madsen).The updated version shares not only the original film's plot, but also the added twist of having husband and wife Baldwin and Basinger step into the roles of the first real-life couple to make the film, Steve McQueen and Ali McGraw. This time, however, the woman's role has been given a tougher '90s edge, with Basinger pulling almost as many punches and firing as many shots as Baldwin, compared to McGraw, who followed McQueen around in wide-eyed, silent terror.The Getawaymaintains the same deliberate, neo-noir pace that made the first film taut, creating a claustrophobic atmosphere in the wide-open, desolate Southwestern landscapes. The scorching sun and heat only add to the strain, making it virtually impossible for anyone to find a dark corner or alleyway to hide in. The car chases and shoot-out finale are charged, though a secondary plot line, between Rudy and the woman he kidnaps and seduces (Jennifer Tilly), comes across as unnecessarily and incongruously brutal.--Natasha Senjanovic", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0008ENHTY", "0767809726", "6305308837", "0783229143", "B00005JMU1", "B004YMATCY", "B0000AZT79", "B00008978V", "B002AS463W", "B00827OWO8", "B000MV90J4", "B00006L92K", "B004XIWRW4", "B00GRZPRB4", "B00JVQ7QTM", "B000EZ9084", "6305308861", "B00006L92S", "B00005JMIJ", "B00CPTUO1Y", "B004ULEENE", "B006M3M5FM", "B00092ZLLM", "B000HT38EO", "6305310335", "B0002V7O5Q", "0767810872", "B0043X1FLI", "0792833848", "B000059TG7", "B00FMGPWD2", "B0009X75MO", "B00AEFY9YY", "B0002CR03G", "B00094AS5O", "B008FYZIZK", "B0000CG8GS", "B00007ELES", "6305127654", "B00J4LMJ3W", "B004SUDQC2", "6305428484", "B000BBOUUE", "B0009GX1CE", "0790729334", "B0042FUHUM", "B00HW3EJ6Y", "B00AEFXBPM", "B00E8G5GU6", "6304806434", "B00004TX5J", "B004MOJW0E", "B000H5TH1Q", "B00K0MM4AM", "B00066VTXU", "B004SIP9CO", "B00004WZ0B", "B000069HZO", "B006GL8NQ0", "B000HC2LHG", "B00827OXJ2", "B006XMK11W", "B00HW3EZXQ", "B00ESZZOLI", "0792845803", "B0019K4YT8", "B0007W6HVM", "B004RBC5UG", "6304936532", "B0045HCJHQ", "0783229151", "B00005Y1UV", "B00005K3NU", "B00441GYR4", "B00004Y87P", "B00008L3S6", "B000065V3E", "B000193318", "B00005ONLF", "B0045HCIWW", "B00005JKI5", "6305657947", "B000Q6GUWK", "6305922675", "0792844874", "B000O5B4C4", "B0033PSH86", "B000UDGOC0", "B0040QYRT0", "B00BEJL6Q8", "B0002XNT1C", "B000059TGC", "B00004STVN", "B00IFHUMNU", "B0001GF2D8", "B000MGBSE4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000NNUX1A", "B0008ENHTY", "B0007ZEOC8", "B0000AZT79"]}, "price": 10.25, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 34812}, "asin": "0783226993", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51P5S530SBL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Getaway (Uncut, Unrated)"}

That terrorist attack led to the deaths of two Jewish children and was pinned on the black-sheep patriarch of the family, a racist, card-carrying Klansman named Sam Cayhall (Hackman), who is now serving time on death row for the hate crime. Years later, the savior grandson cometh. Young-buck lawyer Adam Hall--played with righteous determination and limited range by Chris O'Donnell--pulls out all the stops to save his client from the Mississippi gas chamber. As is usual in Grisham country, the poor lawyer becomes embroiled in a plan more diabolical, corrupt, and layered than he could guess and the truth spirals out of control, endangering lives, and opening old wounds.The Chamberattempts to twist and turn through its plodding story, but there is no gray area in which to force the viewer to weigh his or her conscience against the skewed facts. Everything that occurs inThe Chamberis black or white, good or bad, and there is no crisis of conflict to make us question the morality and stance of the two sides in play. The bad guys are awful, the politicians are bought off, the cops are either corrupt or apathetic, and only one puny guy is left to bring down a house of cards that's been standing solidly for decades. O'Donnell is quickly put to shame by Hackman, who even manages to suffer through a sadistically long, melodramatic stroll down death row with his dignity intact.--Paula Nechak", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000P5FH3K", "B0000694XY", "B00AEFXYJA", "0767810872", "B001I2EQUY", "B00014NEZI", "B0000C3I8M", "B002NZK5R8", "B002NZK5VO", "630542828X", "B002NZK5UU", "B00AMSM9DG", "B0045HCJ8K", "B00AEFXT1S", "B004EPYZP8", "B0006HBZBA", "B000063US3", "B00076YP0I", "B002O3Z4WK", "B0045HCJHQ", "B004RQDYXI", "B001NY4WYC", "B003ASLJIQ", "B00441GYOM", "B000059TFO", "B001MBTTNA", "6305476098", "0385339666", "B0043X1FNQ", "B000WMA73G", "B00005UQ9T", "B00000K0DQ", "B00AEFXYCC", "B008KHTQVE", "B00096S49Y", "B00AEBB9UK", "B00441GYPG", "B002AS464Q", "0790730979", "B002AT8KAG", "B007FQXEWI", "6304765258", "B002AT8K9W", "B0019NG7GI", "B00000J122", "0800141806", "B002U4UYZA", "B003L20IG0", "B00AEBB86U", "B000CEV3M8", "B00AEFXEGS", "B00005ATZT", "B0045HCJFS", "B002DU39GW", "B00005B6JZ", "B0007A0F4E", "B000UEE6TC", "0345531949", "B00DHD933W", "B003AWRMC4", "B002QW7AMG", "B00003CXFV", "B0000DZTLW", "0783240295", "B00000JGHL", "B002O3Z4Y8", "B004EQAVA0", "B00BEIYKX0", "0783226888", "0385339089", "B0009GX1CE", "B003O7I6SE", "B008JFUNKU", "0767802578", "B00009WVSL", "B00004ZBVG", "B009NZXH5S", "B00BLN4UKQ", "B00HOGBXS6", "B000055Y0Y", "B000R4SMCW", "B000B8GT92", "B00005JA9F", "B000056BP3", "B00009YXEO", "B00H9KKGTO", "0792835727", "0385472943", "B00GMV8M2Y", "B0034EZ95A", "B00015YVDG", "B00000JGHN", "B00008K76W", "B00GS08Y3Q", "0440422973", "6305428115", "B000QGDY0G", "B00005JL8F", "B00AEFXX9Q"], "bought_together": ["B000P5FH3K", "B00AEFXYJA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000P5FH3K", "B002NZK5VO", "B00AEFXYJA", "B002NZK5UU"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 20084}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.65, "brand": "Universal Studios", "asin": "0783226942", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/513WRPE69KL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Chamber"}

A petty thief in strife-torn '70s Belfast, Gerry's main interests are getting drunk and partying, much to the dismay of his quiet, frail father Giuseppe (Pete Postlethwaite).

{"description": "Robert Cummings stars as Barry Kane, a patriotic munitions worker who is falsely accused of sabotage, in this wartime thriller from Alfred Hitchcock. Plastered across the front page of every newspaper and hated by the nation, Kane's only hope of clearing his name is to find the real villain. If this sounds a bit like Hitchcock's laterNorth by Northwest, it is. There are interesting echoes throughout, including a heart-stopping sequence on top of a national monument. But the most interesting thing aboutSaboteuris the frequency with which characters demonstrate their willingness to obstruct the police, going on nothing more than the fact that Kane seems like a stand-up guy. They do, again and again, apparently just because good people can spot other good people.Saboteurwas made during the thick of World War II, so there are a few passages of heavy-handed jingoism to get through but they're relatively painless. The script as a whole is a clever one--Algonquin wit Dorothy Parker shares a screenwriting credit, and her trademark zingers make for a terrific mix of humor and suspense.Saboteuris a pleasure whether you're a die-hard Hitchcock fan or just someone who likes a good nail-biter.--Ali Davis", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300183580", "0783235682"], "also_viewed": ["B001D8W7EA", "B000A1INJE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 450820}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.45, "brand": "", "asin": "0783236344", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5110R9HJEJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Saboteur [VHS]"}

{"description": "Jane Campion'sThe Pianostruck a deep chord (if you'll excuse the expression) with audiences in 1993, who were mesmerized by the film's rich, dreamlike imagery. It is the story of a Scottish woman named Ada (Holly Hunter), who has been mute since age 6 because she simply chose not to speak. Ada travels with her daughter Flora (Anna Paquin) and her beloved piano to a remote spot on the coast of New Zealand for an arranged marriage to a farmer (Sam Neill).

After Alex is jailed for bludgeoning the Cat Lady (Miriam Karlin) to death with one of her phallic sculptures, Alex submits to the Ludovico behavior modification technique to earn his freedom; he's conditioned to abhor violence through watching gory movies, and even his adored Beethoven is turned against him. Returned to the world defenseless, Alex becomes the victim of his prior victims, with Mr. Alexander using Beethoven's Ninth to inflict the greatest pain of all.

{"description": "Director William Friedkin was a hot ticket in Hollywood after the success ofThe French Connection, and he turned heads (in more ways than one) when he decided to makeThe Exorcistas his follow-up film. Adapted by William Peter Blatty from hiscontroversial bestseller, this shocking 1973 thriller set an intense and often-copied milestone for screen terror with its unflinching depiction of a young girl (Linda Blair) who is possessed by an evil spirit. Jason Miller and Max von Sydow are perfectly cast as the priests who risk their sanity and their lives to administer the rites of demonic exorcism, and Ellen Burstyn plays Blair's mother, who can only stand by in horror as her daughter's body is wracked by satanic disfiguration. One of the most frightening films ever made,The Exorcistwas mysteriously plagued by troubles during production, and the years have not diminished its capacity to disturb even the most stoical viewers. The film is presented in letterbox format on digital video disc, with a soundtrack that's guaranteed to curdle your blood.

{"description": "From its cleverly choreographed opening sequence to its heart-stopping climax on a rampant carousel, this 1951 Hitchcock classic readily earns its reputation as one of the director's finest examples of timeless cinematic suspense. It's not just a ripping-good thriller but a film student's delight and a perversely enjoyable battle of wits between tennis pro Guy (Farley Granger) and his mysterious, sycophantic admirer, Bruno (Robert Walker), who proposes a &quot;criss-cross&quot; scheme of traded murders. Bruno agrees to kill Guy's unfaithful wife, in return for which Guy will (or so it seems) kill Bruno's spiteful father. With an emphasis on narrative and visual strategy, Hitchcock controls the escalating tension with a master's flair for cinematic design, and the plot (coscripted by Raymond Chandler) is so tightly constructed that you'll be white-knuckled even after multiple viewings.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0002HOEQ2", "B000CCW2SY", "B000ECX0O2", "B0045HCJ9E", "B00871C09S", "B0087ZG7R0", "B001D8W7EK", "B00000CQJZ", "B000A9QK7I", "B00AEBB97S", "B000CCW2TS", "B001D8W7F4", "B000ECX0Q0", "B0002HOEQM", "B001D8W7EU", "B0087ZG7OI", "B00000C0QO", "B002GSXKQA", "B000CCW2U2", "B0002HOER6", "B0087ZG7PW", "B000ECX0S8", "6305999872", "B00AEBB89C", "B003ZEQMH8", "B0002HOEQW", "B00004XPPK", "B000A1INJE", "B00008LDNZ", "B0002HOEQC", "B000CCW2UW", "B000FFJYA2", "B009RWRINE", "B000CCW2UC", "B0002HOEPS", "B0050FXDDQ", "B002VWNIAY", "B005EVY8MQ", "B0006HBV3C", "B0010YSD7W", "B00K6D1QV8", "B000025RE7", "B005H8G78O", "B000MGBSDK", "B007Y1NR1W", "B000PMFRVU", "B00005LC4D", "B0009ML1Z2", "B00065GX64", "B0045HCJQW", "B00AEBBA7W", "B00003CXBZ", "B000244F2S", "B0000549B1", "B00AQ6J5YA", "B008BFSMBA", "B000ECX0QU", "B000FFJYAW", "B004NWPY3E", "B00006RCO1", "B00005AUK9", "B0045HCJ8U", "B00AEFYO5I", "B0008ENIAC", "B00005JKF6", "B000CNE088", "B00DZP1C9K", "B00005RDRL", "B000UVV25Q", "B002945DUM", "B0045HCJHG", "B00AEFXD1O", "B0002ERWZ0", "078323502X", "B000KGGJ1I", "B00003CXBU", "B006TTC5WC", "B000KIX8VK", "B00000JNVC", "B00004W229", "B004CZRE44", "B00AEBB8OC", "B00AMEZDK6", "B000FFJYAC", "B006FE83UE", "B0007US7EY", "B0010AN7Z4", "B000CNE08I", "B0014Z4OMU", "B00553K8DQ", "B000B8380A", "B000244EYW", "B0009S4IKQ", "B00074DY0M", "B00004TJKI", "B005152C9G"], "bought_together": ["B0002HOEQ2", "B0045HCJ9E"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00871C09S", "B0002HOEQ2", "B000CCW2SY", "B0045HCJ9E"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 124487}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.89, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "0790731029", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51J4BhbK2UL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Strangers on a Train"}
{"description": "EDITOR'S NOTE: According to a Warner Home Video technician involved in  the production ofThe Stanley Kubrick Collection, Kubrick authorized all aspects of theCollection, from the use of Digital Component Video (or \"D-1\") masters originally approved in 1989, to the use of minimalist screen menus, chapter stops, and (in the case of2001: A Space OdysseyandThe Shiningon DVD) supplementary materials. Full-screen presentation ofThe ShiningandFull Metal Jacketwas also approved by Kubrick, who recomposed his original framing,  reportedly believing that those films looked best on video in the full-screen format. (In fact, the original theatrical aspect ratio ofThe Shiningwas 1.66:1, meaning that a relatively small portion of the image is lost.) Kubrick also chose mono over stereo,  believing that inconsistencies in theatrical sound systems resulted in loss of control over theatrical presentation. In every respect, the Warner spokesman  said, the films in theCollectionremain as Kubrick approved them. Any future attempt to remaster or alter them would  have to be approved by an appointee of the Kubrick estate.", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301115430", "6300214826", "630018627X", "6304935811", "6301979761", "B00006C7G9", "B00000J2L7", "0784011923", "0790748169", "630407185X", "0800132009", "6302816580", "6301208773", "B00000JGEI", "B000BT8VVK", "B00000IO4G", "630018224X", "0792133153", "6300248135", "6302054982", "630300394X", "B00000K3AN", "6303696813", "6303020089", "6302415853", "6304826133", "6303029027", "0783235607", "6304259131", "B000065JH1", "0800179552", "6301217977", "B00007CVYA", "0800116917", "B0000CDL3W", "6304214502", "6302935148", "6304414099", "6303168507", "076783819X", "6300248089", "0800125762", "630018403X", "6300213005", "6303269834", "6303109950", "6300246965", "B00006IUOZ", "6300183211", "6304925131", "0783202253", "0783107986", "079213690X", "B000005XXG", "B00000FZCU", "0800187873", "6300214540"], "bought_together": ["6301115430", "6300214826"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 348239}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.99, "brand": "", "asin": "0790701251", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ZM1C6TC7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Full Metal Jacket [VHS]"}

Sheriff Bart teams up with deputy Jim (Gene Wilder) to foil the railroad-building scheme of the nefarious Hedley Lamarr (Harvey Korman). The simple plot is just an excuse for a steady stream of gags, many of them unabashedly tasteless, that Brooks and his wacky cast pull off with side-splitting success. The humor is so juvenile and crude that you just have to surrender to it; highlights abound, from the lunkheaded Alex Karras as the ox-riding Mongo to Madeline Kahn's uproarious send-up of Marlene Dietrich as saloon songstress Lili Von Shtupp. Adding to the comedic excess is the infamous campfire scene involving a bunch of hungry cowboys, heaping servings of baked beans and, well, you get the idea.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000G6BLRE", "B000G6BLWE", "B003CRM6PA", "B00AEFXDO6", "B000G6BLW4", "0792844890", "B0000A02TZ", "B00005O3VC", "B000G6BLQU", "B0009UC810", "B0009IOR5M", "B006TTC5GS", "B000M7XR9W", "B00AEFYVMO", "B00287Z18Y", "B000BMY2LU", "B00158K0QU", "B0008JIJ2O", "B000Z8GZYW", "B00AMSQBRQ", "B00441GZ2S", "B00003CXC3", "B000BYA4J2", "B000K405CY", "B00005UEQX", "B00D3LA6AW", "B000A7DVR2", "B000VE439Y", "B00AEBB99Q", "B0001ZX0O2", "B00407PO3W", "B004P9UWM8", "B00004RJ73", "B000A2UBNE", "B00AEFYPAC", "B00005V0XF", "B000G6BLYC", "B00AEFYJI0", "B000P0J0EW", "B002N57KG2", "B0000A14TA", "B007STBUHI", "B00008K76U", "B0019HQICW", "B00005JKCB", "B00BTYRB1C", "B0014Z4OMU", "6305609764", "B007P9HW3M", "B000LBL3TK", "B000E6ESJ4", "B000BKJ762", "B00AMSQBUI", "B00AEFXXMI", "0783227388", "B00005U5A8", "B000P0J09M", "B00079Z9VO", "0792833279", "B00AJCUL1C", "B000089765", "0790742012", "B003ASLJS6", "B004SIP6LS", "B003ELKNH2", "B000EQHXOG", "B000A2UBN4", "B0018Q1F72", "B00004TJQK", "B00AEBB9DM", "6305212112", "B004EPZ084", "B00AEFY3MC", "B0000CBY1C", "B002VWNIAY", "B004FQX5B6", "0783235070", "B000HEZESM", "B000W1SZBS", "0790729342", "B0045HCJKS", "0783227884", "B002VWNIEA", "B00441GZ14", "B000F6ZIII", "B0007ZEOCS", "6304711905", "B006TTC50Y", "B0038Z5SOM", "B003AWRMCE", "B004L9GMBC", "B00BMJ7ZKG", "B005F96UJ6", "B004SIP95G", "B00AEFZ8OY", "B008QE9XD2", "B00005PJ6O", "B0019L21GA", "B001AEF6C2", "B002ZG96ZC"], "bought_together": ["B000G6BLWE", "B00AEFXDO6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000E6ESIK", "B003CRM6PA", "B007NQLA9O", "0792844890"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 48893}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.98, "brand": "", "asin": "0790731487", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51V99G30KSL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Blazing Saddles"}
{"description": "It's enlightening to view Tim Burton'sMars Attacks!as his twisted satire of the blockbuster filmIndependence Day, which was released earlier the same year, although the movies were in production simultaneously. Burton's eye-popping, schlock tribute to 1950s UFO movies actually plays better on video than it did in theaters. The idea of invading aliens ray gunning the big-name movie stars in the cast is a cleverly subversive one, and the bulb-headed, funny-sounding animated Martians are pretty nifty, but it all seemed to be spread thin on the big screen. On video, however, the movie's kooky humor seems a bit more concentrated.

{"description": "After his successful direction of the Broadway hitsBarefoot in the ParkandThe Odd Couple,Mike Nichols made his filmmaking debut with this outstanding and still-powerful screen adaptation (by Ernest Lehman) of Edward Albee's taboo-shattering play. In their fourth film together (and by far their finest), Richard Burton and Oscar winner Elizabeth Taylor play a New England couple whose marriage hangs by a thin thread of self-deception, vicious verbal jousting, and embittered mutual need. George Segal and Sandy Dennis (who also won an Oscar) play the younger, unsuspecting couple who awkwardly witness the devastating rivalry of their hosts.

{"description": "Whether or not you can sympathize with its fascistic-vigilante approach to law enforcement,Dirty Harry(directed by star Clint Eastwood's longtime friend and directorial mentor, Don Siegel) is one hell of a cop thriller. The movie makes evocative use of its San Francisco locations as cop Harry Callahan (Eastwood) tracks the elusive &quot;Scorpio killer&quot; who has been terrorizing the city by the Bay. As the psychopath's trail grows hotter, Harry becomes increasingly impatient and intolerant of the frustrating obstacles (departmental red tape, individuals' civil rights) that he feels are keeping him from doing his job. A characteristically taut and tense piece of filmmaking from Siegel (Invasion of the Body Snatchers,The Shootist,Escape from Alcatraz), it also remains a fascinating slice of American pop culture. It was a big hit (followed by four sequels) that obviously reflected--or exploited--the almost obsessive or paranoid fears and frustrations many Americans felt about crime in the streets. At a time when &quot;law and order&quot; was a familiar slogan for political candidates, Harry Callahan may have represented neither, but from his point of view his job was simple: stop criminals. To him that end justified any means he deemed necessary.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["0790733390", "079073172X", "6300216500", "0792836510", "6300269043", "0790751216", "0792837312", "6302890721", "079284100X", "6302054982", "6304429711", "0784011923", "6302610702", "6302360978", "6300182452", "0792110188", "6300263673", "B000005PF5", "0792835077", "B0000068SI", "6303020089", "630442972X", "6300214826", "6300183211", "B000003KDG", "6301976061", "B00000J2KZ", "630118663X", "0790734079", "6303212263", "6300214060", "6301327845", "0783222955", "6300271331", "B00000K2SC", "0792842464", "B000005PJ6", "6304437315", "0792133153", "6301802330", "6304025831", "6300181405", "6302787564", "0790735423", "6303029027", "0792108868", "0790751267", "6304509154", "0790705141", "B000007OY0", "6300269639", "0800100832", "6303686796", "630281622X", "6304258984", "079284517X", "0792839234", "6303920098", "0792110285", "6305622825", "6302712009", "0790733927", "6301586026", "0800125762", "6302596092", "630018224X", "0790748169", "0792839846", "6301971809", "6303506291", "6305576173", "0783223218", "6300214540", "0783241542", "6303313345"], "bought_together": ["0790733390"], "also_viewed": ["079073172X", "B005GJTZZG", "0790737744", "0790751267", "0792836510", "630118663X", "0790733390"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 365837}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.94, "brand": "", "asin": "0790731975", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41VY4VS01BL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Dirty Harry [VHS]"}
{"description": "The satirical sensibilities of writer Peter Shaffer and director Milos Forman (One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest) were ideally matched in this Oscar-winning movie adaptation of Shaffer's hit play about the rivalry between two composers in the court of Austrian Emperor Joseph II--official royal composer Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham), and the younger but superior prodigy Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce). The conceit is absolutely delicious: Salieri secretly loathes Mozart's crude and bratty personality, but is astounded by the beauty of his music. That's the heart of Salieri's torment--although he's in a unique position to recognize and cultivate both Mozart's talent and career, he's also consumed with envy and insecurity in the face of such genius. That such magnificent music should come from such a vulgar little creature strikes Salieri as one of God's cruelest jokes, and it drives him insane.Amadeuscreates peculiar and delightful contrasts between the impeccably re-created details of its lavish period setting and the jarring (but humorously refreshing and unstuffy) modern tone of its dialogue and performances--all of which serve to remind us that these were people before they became enshrined in historical and artistic legend. Jeffrey Jones, best-known as Ferris Bueller's principal, is particularly wonderful as the bumbling emperor (with the voice of a modern midlevel businessman). The film's eight Oscars include statuettes for Best Director Forman, Best Actor Abraham (Hulce was also nominated), Best Screenplay, and Best Picture.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305261296", "B00000K3AN", "6305470448", "6302250269", "0800132009", "0790743213", "B000067JAU", "6304071876"], "bought_together": ["6305261296"], "also_viewed": ["6303168507"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 287790}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.88, "brand": "", "asin": "0790734060", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/512Y1EHFXCL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Amadeus [VHS]"}
{"description": "There were two movies about murder and the U.S. presidency released in 1997, and when you compare it toAbsolute Power, this one is clearly the lesser of the two. That doesn't mean it's a bad movie, but it does make it a mildly disappointing one, and it illustrates the hazards of crafting a film to fit the persona of its leading man. In this case, you've got Wesley Snipes, a young, savvy man of action, playing a Washington, D.C., police detective assigned to investigate the murder of a woman in the White House. The president's son is a prime suspect, but there's a cover-up underway that forces Snipes to intensify his investigation beyond normal parameters. For a while at least, this makesMurder at 1600a sharp and interesting film, and while the national security advisor (Alan Alda) seems highly cooperative (but don't be so sure), Snipes meets a secret service member (Diane Lane) who shares his belief in a high-level conspiracy. Unfortunately, that's when the film takes a downward plunge, resorting to a series of thriller clich&eacute;s including an unlikely chase through secret tunnels beneath the White House. We're not suggesting this couldn't happen, but it's the kind of thing you typically see in movies that have run out of original ideas before they're over. Kinda makes you want to watchAbsolute Poweragain, doesn't it?--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002AT8KA6", "0790736411", "B000B8GT92", "B003ASLJIQ", "B0045HCJFS", "6305428115", "B000JYW5BE", "B00AEFXT1S", "B00000ILBN", "B000CEV3M8", "B000055Y0Y", "B002AT8K9W", "B001B3LIOC", "B00015YVDG", "0783240295", "B00096S49Y", "B00AEFXYJA", "B000ENC5YW", "B002O3Z4WK", "B000U1ZV4Y", "B00AEFYUQQ", "B002NZK5UU", "B002AS464Q", "0767803434", "B00003CXMV", "B000QUCRB4", "B004IK30MI", "B00AP2DC94", "B00441GYXI", "B000NTMA0Q", "B00004STDN", "B00DHD933W", "B000OT6V0K", "6304765258", "B002GHHHME", "0792159659", "B000YCPUWW", "6304711891", "B000U1ZV8K", "B00008K76U", "B000PISZ7M", "B002AT8KAG", "B003ASLJJU", "B00029RT9E", "B004F7BGBG", "B00005JA9F", "B0009FU0ZG", "B00AEBB9UK", "B002GIBVVG", "B0029F253E", "B00009L1TA", "0783226888", "B00AEFYW64", "0780618548", "B0002V7OI8", "B00AEFY6PQ", "B0045HCIWW", "B004GJYRK0", "B00005JL8F", "B000BYY11Y", "B00AEFYF2K", "B00005ATZT", "6304806434", "B00151QYXU", "B001AK3S4E", "B0050MB5NO", "B00026ZG10", "6304884400", "B00003CXGV", "B002NZK5R8", "B000MGBSE4", "B0050MB4OO", "B003AWRMC4", "B0045HCJ8K", "B002NZK5RI", "0792833848", "B0076YFJUY", "6305213283", "B0006GANOQ", "6304806450", "B00008G8M4", "B0045HCJGC", "B000G5SILC", "B0000542CK", "B000HEVZ80", "0767810872", "B00000I1JZ", "B00007AJG1", "B002NZK5VO", "B00061I294", "B00000JDIQ", "B00005UQ9T", "B000GFLKF8", "B000HT38IK", "0783110871", "B00000G3PA", "0783226934", "B007FQXEWI", "B00014NEZI", "B002O3Z4ZW"], "bought_together": ["B002AT8KA6", "6305428115"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002AT8KA6", "B000JYW5BE", "6305428115", "B000CEV3M8"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 18956}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.99, "brand": "SNIPES,WESLEY", "asin": "0790732149", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Z1X5Z08AL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Murder at 1600 (Snap Case Packaging)"}

{"description": "The last film completed by Bruce Lee before his untimely death,Enter the Dragonwas his entr&eacute;e into Hollywood. The American-Hong Kong coproduction, shot in Asia by American director Robert Clouse, stars Lee as a British agent sent to infiltrate the criminal empire of bloodthirsty Asian crime lord Han (Shih Kien) through his annual international martial arts tournament. Lee spends his days taking on tournament combatants and nights breaking into the heavily guarded underground fortress, kicking the living tar out of anyone who stands in his way. The mix of kung fu fighting (choreographed by Lee himself) and James Bond intrigue (the plot has more than a passing resemblance toDr. No) is pulpy by any standard, but the generous budget and talented cast of world-class martial artists puts this film in a category well above Lee's earlier Hong Kong productions. Unfortunately he's off the screen for large chunks of time as American maverick competitors (and champion martial artists) John Saxon and Jim Kelly take center stage, but once the fighting starts Lee takes over. The tournament setting provides an ample display of martial arts mastery of many styles and climaxes with a huge free-for-all, but the highlight is Lee's brutal one-on-one with the claw-fisted Han in the dynamic hall-of-mirrors battle.

{"description": "Let's see--he's been Han Solo in three films and Indiana Jones in three more. So why shouldn't Harrison Ford take on a new continuing character in Tom Clancy's CIA analyst Jack Ryan? In this film, directed by Phillip Noyce, Ford picked up the baton when Alec Baldwin, who played Ryan inThe Hunt for Red October, opted for a Broadway role instead. In this film, Ryan and his family are on vacation when Ryan saves a member of the British royal family from attack by Irish terrorists.

{"description": "\"When the legend becomes fact, print the legend.\" That's more than the code of a newspaperman inThe Man Who Shot Liberty Valance; it's practically the operating credo of director John Ford, the most honored of American filmmakers. In this late film from a long career, Ford looks at the civilizing of an Old West town, Shinbone, through the sad memories of settlers looking back. In the town's wide-open youth, two-fisted Westerner John Wayne and tenderfoot newcomer James Stewart clash over a woman (Vera Miles) but ultimately unite against the notorious outlaw Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin). Ford's nostalgia for the past is tempered by his stark approach, unusual for the visual poet ofStagecoachandThe Searchers. The two heavyweights, Wayne and Stewart, are good together, with Wayne the embodiment of rugged individualism and Stewart the idealistic prophet of the civilization that will eventually tame the Wild West. This may be the saddest Western ever made, closer to an elegy than an action movie, and as cleanly beautiful as its central symbol, the cactus rose.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300988473", "B0000TANUI", "6301798090", "6301802330", "0792110188", "B000051S3Z", "0792107683", "6300268470", "0792107128", "6300181715", "0782008348", "B000M7BEPQ", "6300267938", "630197705X", "0790741040", "6301797922", "6300267830", "6301736362", "6304457308", "0792105907", "0792102320", "6300183041", "0792108868", "6300268799", "1555265952", "078321541X", "B00004RFFA", "B001E419N8", "6300216012", "6300208281", "6300181588", "6303192254", "6301662962", "6302923042", "6300269884", "630442972X", "6304673019", "6300246965", "6304457316", "6300215733", "6303393985", "0790751216", "630150528X", "6301805518", "0792838556", "6304457278", "B0000022WA", "6301718275", "6304441630", "B00005RRG6", "079283853X", "B0000TANUS", "6300184951", "B000M5BRX2", "6303120474", "6303334598", "6302751136", "0790743159", "6303471730", "6303109918", "6300216209", "6301976924", "6301972163", "6301773586", "6302226899", "6300213676", "B00004WZR1", "6302360978", "6301978110", "6301797906"], "bought_together": ["B000M7BEPQ"], "also_viewed": ["6301802330", "6300267938"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 230138}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.92, "brand": "", "asin": "0792106989", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51AQQ4TCP1L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance [VHS]"}

{"description": "Mel Gibson's Oscar-winning 1995Braveheartis an impassioned epic about William Wallace, the 13th-century Scottish leader of a popular revolt against England's tyrannical Edward I (Patrick McGoohan). Gibson cannily plays Wallace as a man trying to stay out of history's way until events force his hand, an attribute that instantly resonates with several of the actor's best-known roles, especiallyMad Max. The subsequent camaraderie and courage Wallace shares in the field with fellow warriors is pure enough and inspiring enough to bring envy to a viewer, and even as things go wrong for Wallace in the second half, the film does not easily cave in to a somber tone. One of the most impressive elements is the originality with which Gibson films battle scenes, featuring hundreds of extras wielding medieval weapons. After Eisenstein'sAlexander Nevsky, Orson Welles'sChimes at Midnight, and even Kenneth Branagh'sHenry V, you might think there is little new that could be done in creating scenes of ancient combat; yet Gibson does it.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00004XPQ6", "B00003CXE6", "6303953425", "6304935811", "B0001VL30O", "B000054OW2", "6302415853", "0790741512", "6304071876", "6301792734", "6303168507", "6303942830", "0800125762", "6300183211", "B000007OY0", "B000056BRF", "6300214540", "B000065U6Q", "B00004WIDB", "B00003CXTF", "B00007KK15", "079070546X", "B0000A36J1", "B00000K3AN", "6302482712", "6300263673", "6305169187", "0788811355", "B00003BE3X", "0800116917", "6304414099", "6303020089", "0792133153", "0790744589", "6302909023", "0800132009", "079212569X", "6300185095", "6303313345", "0767819462", "6304259131", "B00000K2SC", "0800199421", "B0001DI5W6", "B00005JLTM", "630018224X", "0790701251", "6304151306", "6303696813", "0790731274", "0792147618", "B00005RIJ3", "6301586026", "6302945089", "0783223218", "6305718792"], "bought_together": ["B00004XPQ6", "B00003CXE6"], "also_viewed": ["0792151712", "6303314015", "6301966988", "6303402348", "B00004WIDB", "0792116887", "6300213668", "0800125762", "B00004XPQ6", "0792842111", "B00003CXTF", "0788812408", "6302526574", "6303215734", "0788806270", "6300183211", "B00004U8P4", "0788802194"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 521725}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 0.5, "brand": "", "asin": "0792139771", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51PF2QYK62L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Braveheart (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]"}

While graced with such 1950s niceties as VistaVision and Technicolor,The Ten Commandments(DeMille had already filmed an earlier version in 1923) has an anachronistic, impassioned style that finds lead actors Charlton Heston and Yul Brynner expressively posing while hundreds of extras writhe either in the presence of God's power or from orgiastic heat. DeMille, as always, plays both sides of the fence as far as sin goes, surrounding Heston's Moses with worshipful music and heavenly special effects while also making the sexy action around the cult of the Golden Calf look like fun.

{"description": "The last film of John Wayne could not have been more fitting, full of details that can't help but make one reflect upon his legacy in the movies and his life as a star. Wayne plays a career gunfighter in the autumn of his life, trying to hang up his pistols after he discovers he's dying of cancer.  Boarding in the house of an attractive widow (Lauren Bacall) and her son (Ron Howard), Wayne's character opts for peace in his final days but is dogged by his reputation when a handful of killers seeks him out for a final fight. Howard is fine as a fatherless boy who needs the strong mentor the hero represents, and James Stewart--who costarred with Wayne in the greatMan Who Shot Liberty Valance--plays the doctor who gives the big man the bad news. Don Siegel (Invasion of the Body Snatchers) thoughtfully directs a very special and sensitive production.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300181588", "0792110188", "0792106989", "630197705X", "6303192254", "6301802330", "0792105907", "6300269884", "6300182452", "0792838556", "6304457278", "B003ASLJRC", "B001E419N8", "0783222955", "0792102320", "6303599052", "6300183041", "6300181715", "6300988473", "6300268799", "6301967488", "6301797922", "0792107128", "630150528X", "0792837967", "6304457316", "6301798090", "6300268470", "6301718275", "6300215733", "6300216233", "6300208281", "B00004RFFA", "0783216084", "0790731975", "6300269175", "6300215865", "0790751305", "6302909023", "B000GX7MMA"], "bought_together": ["6300181588", "6301802330"], "also_viewed": ["6300181588", "6300269884", "0792110188", "6301736362", "6302320496", "6301802330", "6300988473"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 236081}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.45, "brand": "", "asin": "0792108868", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51891KWXHJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Shootist [VHS]"}

{"description": "When the theatrical release of James Cameron'sTitanicwas delayed from July to December of 1997, media pundits speculated that Cameron's $200&nbsp;million disaster epic would cause the director's downfall, signal the end of the blockbuster era, and sink Paramount Studios as quickly as the ill-fated luxury liner had sunk on that fateful night of April&nbsp;14, 1912. Some studio executives were confident, others horrified, but the clarity of hindsight turned Cameron into an Oscar-winning genius, a shrewd businessman, and one of the most successful directors in the history of motion pictures.Titanicwould surpass the $1&nbsp;billion mark in global box-office receipts (largely due to multiple viewings, the majority by teenage girls), win 11&nbsp;Academy Awards including best picture and director, produce the best-selling movie soundtrack of all time, and make a global superstar of Leonardo DiCaprio. A bona fide pop-cultural phenomenon, the film has all the ingredients of a blockbuster (romance, passion, luxury, grand scale, a snidely villain, and an epic, life-threatening crisis), but Cameron's alchemy of these ingredients proved more popular than anyone could have predicted. His stroke of genius was to combine absolute authenticity with a pair of fictional lovers whose tragic fate would draw viewers into the heart-wrenching reality of theTitanicdisaster. As starving artist Jack Dawson and soon-to-be-married socialite Rose DeWitt Bukater, DiCaprio and Kate Winslet won the hearts of viewers around the world, and their brief but never-forgotten love affair provides the humanity that Cameron needed to turnTitanicinto an emotional experience. Present-day framing scenes (featuring Gloria Stuart as the 101-year-old Rose) add additional resonance to the story, and although some viewers proved vehemently immune to Cameron's manipulations, few can deny the production's impressive achievements. Although some of the computer-generated visual effects look artificial, others--such as the sunset silhouette ofTitanicduring its first evening at sea, or the climactic splitting of the ship's sinking hull--are state-of-the-art marvels. In terms of sets and costumes alone, the film is never less than astounding. More than anything else, however, the film's overwhelming popularity speaks for itself.Titanicis an event film and a monument to Cameron's risk-taking audacity, blending the tragic irony of theTitanicdisaster with just enough narrative invention to give the historical event its fullest and most timeless dramatic impact.Titanicis an epic love story on par withGone with the Wind, and like that earlier box-office phenomenon, it's a film for the ages.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305123616", "6304117752", "6301792734", "6303215734", "B00000JS61", "6304178352", "6303396623", "6303314015", "B00003CXTF", "0769403468", "6301734734", "6302936381", "6303300480", "6305368139", "B00005RRG3", "6302610702", "0792839846", "6300207919", "B000P0J0C4", "6304546262", "B000056BRF", "6304400551", "6303101267", "630150528X", "6303637574", "B000P0J0EW", "6305126062", "6302935148", "0800199421", "6304681496", "0792116887", "6301963911", "B0000DCGT1", "B00001IVED", "6305169187", "B00006RCST", "6300216721", "630197879X", "0800113055", "076780922X", "080010367X", "0800141326", "0800184319", "6304039522", "B000066AXC"], "bought_together": ["6305123616"], "also_viewed": ["B009VQHDSQ", "6303314015", "B0074JODXU", "B00003CXTF", "B003JQZXWW", "6302787068", "6301796535", "0788812807", "0788806270", "B00005JKDQ", "6304500831", "6305229449", "6304117752", "6300213668", "6304089767", "B0000AQZYM", "079213690X", "6303049079", "6305123616", "6303402348", "6301792734", "0788812408", "B00079HZSE", "B000035Z2S", "B00000K3AN", "0788805843", "6302526574", "B0000029YC", "6303534422", "6303215734", "B0070285YE", "B00008LDO9", "0783216084", "6304434340", "B00BBND56G", "0788805533", "6300183211", "6302320402", "6305750750", "B0002CHI3S", "0790748266", "6304143184", "B0000040CM", "B005X7H9SQ", "B00004RFHF", "B00005V1Z7", "6302814782", "6301572688", "B00000JS61", "B008SLUWZG", "6303257844", "B00078XGO2", "0790736039", "B0000040EJ", "B000065U6Q", "B00003CX7L", "B00000ADKZ", "6300263673", "6302178924"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 65950}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.47, "brand": "Paramount", "asin": "0792151712", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21BAWEVBJ1L.jpg", "title": "Titanic [VHS]"}

{"description": "The great improvisational comedy team of Mike Nichols and Elaine May reunited to (respectively) direct and write this update of the French comedyLa Cage Aux Folles. Robin Williams stars as a gay Miami nightclub owner who is forced to play it straight and ask his drag-queen partner (Nathan Lane) to hide out when Williams's son invites his prospective--and highly conservative--in-laws and fianc&eacute;e to a meet-and-greet dinner party. Gene Hackman and Dianne Wiest play the straight-laced senator and his wife, and Calista Flockhart (from television'sAlly McBeal) plays their daughter in a culture-clash with outrageous consequences. May's witty screenplay incorporates some pointed observations about the political landscape of the 1990s and takes a sensitive approach to the comedy's underlying drama.

{"description": "A man calling himself Henry Faber is actually \"the Needle,\" a German spy in England bearing critical information on Allied invasion plans that he must deliver personally to the Fhrer. He's so named because of his preferred method of assassination, the stiletto. He is a coldly calculating sociopath, emotionlessly focused on the task at hand, whether the task is to signal a U-boat or to gut a witness to avoid exposure.\n\nOn his way back to Germany, a fierce storm strands him on Storm Island, occupied only by a woman named Lucy (Kate Nelligan), her disabled husband, their son, and their shepherd, Tom. A romance develops between the woman and the spy, due to an estrangement of affections between Lucy and her husband, whose accident has rendered him emotionally crippled as well.\n\nThe love affair suggests there's a sympathetic personality buried somewhere inside the Nazi spy, though he remains enigmatic. Early on, we discover that he may not enjoy the hand life has dealt him. When a courier asks him about the way he lives, and \"What else can one do?\" the Needle answers, \"One can just stop.\"\n\nLucy realizes that her lover has been lying after she discovers her husband's dead body. \"The Needle\" must get to Tom's radio in time to report to his superiors the exact location of the D-Day invasion. Lucy is the Allies' last chance. He is reluctant to harm her, but she has no such qualms and shoots him as he tries to escape in a boat.

{"description": "Maybe \"nobody's perfect,\" as one character in this masterpiece suggests. But some movies are perfect, andSome Like It Hotis one of them. In Chicago, during the Prohibition era, two skirt-chasing musicians, Joe and Jerry (Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon), inadvertently witness the St. Valentine's Day Massacre. In order to escape the wrath of gangland chief Spats Colombo (George Raft), the boys, in drag, join an all-woman band headed for Florida. They vie for the attention of the lead singer, Sugar Kane (Marilyn Monroe), a much-disappointed songbird who warbles \"I'm Through with Love\" but remains vulnerable to yet another unreliable saxophone player. (When Curtis courts her without his dress, he adopts the voice of Cary Grant--a spot-on impersonation.) The script by director Billy Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond is beautifully measured; everything works, like a flawless clock. Aspiring screenwriters would be well advised to throw away the how-to books and simply study this film. The bulk of the slapstick is handled by an unhinged Lemmon and the razor-sharp Joe E. Brown, who plays a horny retiree smitten by Jerry's feminine charms. For all the gags, the film is also wonderfully romantic, as Wilder indulges in just the right amounts of moonlight and the lilting melody of \"Park Avenue Fantasy.\"Some Like It Hotis so delightfully fizzy, it's hard to believe the shooting of the film was a headache, with an unhappy Monroe on her worst behavior.

He's come to Las Vegas literally to drink himself to death, and that's when he meets Sera (Elisabeth Shue), a prostitute who falls in love with him--and he with her--despite their mutual dead-end existence. They accept each other as they are, with no attempts by one to change the other, and this unconditional love turnsLeaving Las Vegasinto a somber yet quietly beautiful love story. Earning Oscar nominations for Best Director (Mike Figgis), Best Adapted Screenplay (Figgis, from John O'Brien's novel) and Best Actress (Shue), the film may strike some as relentlessly bleak and glacially paced, but attentive viewers will readily discover the richness of these tragic characters and the exceptional performances that bring them to life. (In a sad echo of his own fiction, novelist John O'Brien committed suicide while this film was in production.) The DVD features uncut, unrated footage that was not included in the film's theatrical release.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0045HCJ08", "6305692572", "B00004UEDQ", "B0000549B1", "B000ERVK4Y", "6305594333", "B00008MTXI", "B003YKYX9M", "6305162026", "B00A2H9QN8", "B000000QHZ", "B0057ZAA6W", "B00005Q4CS", "B00049QQHI", "B000I0QL7I", "B000BBOUW2", "B00009Y3QI", "B00AFEXRME", "0802134459", "B000PAAJZ6", "B0001EFV7C", "B000QXDCLA", "0792844831", "B0039Y774Q", "B000LAZDPG", "B00JAGF9HE", "B00003CXWV", "0783229526", "B0007CEXYK", "B002CTJW0G", "6304806434", "B000PMFRZQ", "6304711891", "B00AEBB8JM", "0767830555", "B007VI5AQ8", "B00062IVM6", "B000JBXXYK", "0780622782", "B00012QLB4", "B00007ELEN", "B00080ZG10", "B00003CWM3", "B000H5TH20", "B000065V3G", "0767802616", "B00005JL5F", "B00005JM23", "B000035Z5G", "B001J710Z2", "B0006GAOJA", "B000Z3N1HQ", "B00BTYMPX6", "1572526769", "B001TOD92C", "B000KX0IOK", "B000LPS4L6", "B00003CWQR", "B00002RAO2", "B0017X1WGK", "B0028OH568", "B00004Z4WR", "B000BYA5G4", "B00000IQW8", "B001KRVLCI", "B00005JLRE", "B000GRUMRS", "B00143XE00", "B0014GI6I2", "B00003CXKA", "B0002KPI1E", "B000J10F8C", "B0006IIKRG", "B000XSKDBA", "B000KX0HFA", "B000O77SF4", "B00GRZPRB4", "B003ELKNH2", "B00000K0DQ", "B002AF4Y9G", "0792846435", "B000024UEB", "B00002VWE0", "B00006LPGP", "B00011CZRE", "B00195I3O0", "6305784892", "B004SEUJXM", "B008B9JTLI", "B00AEBB9AK", "B000059XTI", "B0009R1TI6", "B002CPMB9O", "B0007Y08QA", "B00005JMJG", "B002GHHHKG", "B00000FE2D", "B003ASLJQS", "B00GFZLEF4", "B0002KPIQY"], "bought_together": ["6305692572", "B0045HCJ08"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B008MU8ZQ6", "6305692572", "B000C20VPA", "B00AFEXRME"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 21598}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.01, "brand": "MGM", "asin": "0792838068", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51CSZF81KKL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Leaving Las Vegas"}
{"description": "A flawed but admirably ambitious gangster movie,Hoodlumaspires to be a kind of Harlem-based equivalent toThe Godfather, and while it falls short of that lofty goal it's still got plenty of qualities to make it well worth seeing. It's the first film to tell the story of Ellsworth &quot;Bumpy&quot; Johnson (charismatically played by Laurence Fishburne), an ex-convict who dominated the Harlem numbers racket during the 1930s and '40s. As he rises to power he gains equally powerful enemies, including hotheaded Bronx gangster Dutch Schultz (Tim Roth) and the suave mobster Lucky Luciano (Andy Garcia). Determined to defend his Harlem turf against these invaders, Bumpy eclipses the &quot;policy queen&quot; Stephanie St. Clair (Cicely Tyson) and becomes a self-styled Robin Hood figure, attracting the attention of a community servant (Vanessa Williams) who must confront the brutality of Bumpy's business. A must-see for anyone who likes gangster movies,Hoodlumis certainly not a masterpiece, but sharp performances and some powerful scenes make it an interesting look at a little-known chapter in criminal history.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00007AJG1", "B00AEFY6TW", "B004YCKJGU", "B0000AMJEK", "6305505802", "1558908390", "B0041QSZS8", "B0000JBUHI", "B00004U103", "B00005IA7Y", "B0001FGBUW", "B00003W8NT", "B007TBIUSM", "B00AEFYE08", "B00000JGHV", "B002CPMB9O", "B000059TGC", "B0000TWMT8", "B000TLOMPE", "6305505780", "B004SIP93S", "B003BV8I3Q", "B0000696I2", "B00005U156", "B000JJSL1W", "B0000YEE6M", "B00AEBB9AA", "B006VRRGQW", "B000H5TH20", "B000P0J0CE", "B002CA68N4", "B000KG4BD6", "B000EHSVRI", "6305428409", "B002CA68NO", "B0000DI87S", "B00005JLG1", "B004G7XCRQ", "B00441GZ1Y", "B000BOH8X2", "B00004Z1FX", "B00465I1CE", "B000A2XAQ4", "B0009S4IGA", "B00BTYPWDQ", "B000068QPV", "B00AEBB9NM", "B000E5KQHI", "B00008977B", "B001C0I61M", "0780627822", "0783237367", "B00005JL72", "B00007ELEO", "B0006H32DO", "B000FS9ULC", "B000HDZKLO", "B003VA3JZY", "B0000549B2", "B000BITV9W", "B002CWKU36", "B00004XPPB", "B00023P4IS", "0767811070", "B000P0J0AG", "B000051YMS", "B002GSXKOM", "B00005B8UA", "B000P0J09M", "B0009K7RMA", "B00005RDAO", "B00008RH3L", "B0034G4OSG", "B000C20VRS", "B0016LFG4M", "B00007L4KF", "B00005UQ9I", "B001DJLD12", "B000JLTRH2", "B00066FAQW", "B00005AQML", "B00003CY51", "B00003CXWV", "B0000AM6JI", "B001P3SA94", "B00005N7Z6", "B000089729", "B000QXDCLU", "0792833848", "B000060MWA", "B000JYW5BO", "B00CMDPT3Q", "B002VWNIEA", "B002QEHPQU", "B003HKN534", "B001K98MGE", "B00005JLON", "6305428441", "6304884400", "B00000JGHJ"], "bought_together": ["B00AEFY6TW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AEFY6TW", "B0000YEE6M", "1558908390", "B00BTYPWDQ"]}, "price": 6.48, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 33559}, "asin": "0792838076", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51AIkLOvT1L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Hoodlum"}
{"description": "Ah, those fun-loving Communists! InNinotchkathree Soviets make their way to Paris to sell off imperial jewels to raise money to buy tractors for the USSR. When Grand Duchess Swana (Ina Claire), former owner of the jewels, discovers what's happening, she deploys her lover Leon (Melvyn Douglas) to recover her gems. He starts a court proceeding while seducing the three bumbling Soviets with the luxuries of capitalistic life. The delay of the sale is noticed in Moscow, and Comrade Ninotchka (Greta Garbo) is dispatched to Paris to settle the matter. Soon after arrival, she meets Leon, who is charmed by her severe, uptight manner and her stunning beauty (\"I love Russians! Comrade, I've been fascinated by your five-year plan for the last 15 years\"), and he sets about wooing her, despite her disbelief in love (it's merely a \"chemical reaction,\" she dourly informs him). Romance, jealousy, and capitalistic frivolity ensue.When this film was released in 1939, it was advertised as \"Garbo laughs,\" as it was her first and only comedy. The film, directed by Ernst Lubitsch, is amusing not only for its story line, but also for its dated look at early Communism (Ninotchka keeps a photo of a stern-looking Lenin by her bedside, although she feels uncomfortable doing so in a room that costs 2,000 francs a night, the price of a cow back home). The satirical image of the young Communist fighting against corrupt Western ways seems somewhat idealistic today but nonetheless provided levity during the shaky political times of the film's release. Viewers may be jarred by the casual \"Heil Hitler\" greeting of a couple at the train station, but overall this film holds up as one of Lubitsch's masterpieces and a lighter glimpse of the mysterious Garbo.--Jenny Brown", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000K0YLZ0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 493885}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.09, "brand": "", "asin": "0792840062", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51NRVK2PQTL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Ninotchka [VHS]"}
{"description": "Five years afterCaptain Bloodmade him a swashbuckling star, Errol Flynn returned to the high seas as privateer Captain Thorpe inThe Sea Hawk. Flynn plays the dashing gentleman pirate as dedicated patriot, looting Spanish ships for English coffers with the private blessing of Queen Elizabeth (Flora Robson, reprising the role fromFire over England). The film opens with a rousing sea battle: broadside cannon fire sends masts falling and splinters a-flying before Flynn's men take their Spanish quarry in a furious shipboard cutlass battle. The fearless fighter becomes a stumbling schoolboy when he falls for the Spanish ambassador's niece, but he's back in his element when he sails to the New World for treasure and lands in the middle of a deadly conspiracy. Big-eyed beauty Brenda Marshall stands in for Flynn's usual love interest Olivia de Havilland, and the film misses the latter's sass and spirit, but it's a minor shortcoming. Claude Rains plays his usual smoothly conniving villain, and hearty Alan Hale returns as Flynn's loyal sidekick. Michael Curtiz proves once again why he was Warner Brothers' top director with a handsome, action-packed film that mixes intrigue and suspense with grand set pieces, concluding with a rousing series of escapes, chases, and a runaway sword fight.

{"description": "Based on Thomas Harris's novel, this terrifying film by Jonathan Demme really only contains a couple of genuinely shocking moments (one involving an autopsy, the other a prison break). The rest of the film is a splatter-free visual and psychological descent into the hell of madness, redeemed astonishingly by an unlikely connection between a monster and a haunted young woman. Anthony Hopkins is extraordinary as the cannibalistic psychiatrist Dr. Hannibal Lecter, virtually entombed in a subterranean prison for the criminally insane. At the behest of the FBI, agent-in-training Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) approaches Lecter, requesting his insights into the identity and methods of a serial killer named Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine). In exchange, Lecter demands the right to penetrate Starling's most painful memories, creating a bizarre but palpable intimacy that liberates them both under separate but equally horrific circumstances. Demme, a filmmaker with a uniquely populist vision (Melvin and Howard,Something Wild), also spent his early years making pulp for Roger Corman (Caged Heat), and he hasn't forgotten the significance of tone, atmosphere, and the unsettling nature of a crudely effective close-up. Much of the film, in fact, consists of actors staring straight into the camera (usually from Clarice's point of view), making every bridge between one set of eyes to another seem terribly dangerous.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005LKIM", "6302054982", "B00008AOS5", "B00005PJ8I", "B000007OY0", "6302800420", "0790705141", "B00003CXE6", "6301179552", "6301427076", "B000003KHS", "6300989003", "6303402348", "B0000633ZP", "B00005ATQA"], "bought_together": ["6302054982"], "also_viewed": ["6305363668", "6302415853", "0792116887", "079213690X", "0800103106", "6305750750"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 331980}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.0, "brand": "", "asin": "0792842111", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4117Q86BS0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Silence of the Lambs [VHS]"}
{"description": "Freddy Benson (Steve Martin) is a crass, loud American.  Laurence Jameson (Michael Caine) is a suave, urbane European. Their common ground is that they both are confidence men, and they meet in a train compartment as Benson is scamming his way across Europe, taking advantage of women's generosity. The two are forced into a rivalry, which culminates in a wager to see who can be the first to bilk $50,000 out of American heiress Janet Colgate (Glenne Headly). Their game of one-upmanship is, of course, brought to ridiculous heights as things progress. Written by Paul Henning (the mind behind such TV shows asGreen AcresandThe Beverly Hillbillies),Dirty Rotten Scoundrelsis an uneven but funny mix of Martin's physical comedy and Caine's oily charms. Martin's first role as cohort is to assume the persona of Ruprecht, the \"special\" younger brother intended to scare off potential brides. As Ruprecht, he comes off as a cross betweenThe Andy Griffith Show's Ernest T. Bass and Jerry Lewis; hilarious as it is, it doesn't quite fit with the rest of the film. Once the wager is on, though, Martin slips into his overly earnest mode as an American military man suffering from hysterical paralysis, with Caine as a psychologist who takes on his case. All in all,Dirty Rotten Scoundrels(a loose remake of the 1964 filmBedtime Storywith David Niven and Marlon Brando) is a droll, intelligent comedy, short on knee slappers but long on comic situations and characterizations.--Jerry Renshaw", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 434002}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.66, "brand": "", "asin": "0792842391", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/513ZVBB0X6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Dirty Rotten Scoundrels [VHS]"}
{"description": "Clint Eastwood and Jeff Bridges (in an Oscar&#xC2;(r) nominated* performance) star as an off-beat pair of modern-day outlaws in this bold, action-packed crime thriller. Featuring outstanding supporting performances by George Kennedy (Airport), Gary Busey (Lethal Weapon) and Geoffrey Lewis (Maverick), it's a  crisp, well-written, witty, tough [and] superbly cast caper movie  (Cinebooks).   John 'thunderbolt  Doherty (Eastwood) is a former thief whose razor-sharp wits and steely nerves made him a master of his profession, but he's about to reenter the criminal world with a new partner: Lightfoot (Bridges), a brash young drifter whose energy and exuberance give the veteran a new outlook on life. Their target: the seemingly impenetrable Montana Armored Depository. After forming an uneasy alliance with Thunderbolt's former partners in crime (Kennedy and Lewis),they launch an amazing scheme that will test the limits of their endurance...and the power of theirfriendship.  Fueled by explosive action, fascinating characters and a powerfully moving climax, Thunderbolt and Lightfoot is an adventure of the highest caliber.  *1974: Supporting Actor", "related": {"also_bought": ["B003AWRMCY", "B003AWRMBU", "B003AWRM9W", "B003ASLJNQ", "B00AEFXVOI", "B003AWRMA6", "0783230346", "0783227930", "B00AEFYTEY", "B0001FVDJQ", "B003ASLJKE", "B003AWRMC4", "B00009N83V", "B000055Y0Y", "B003ASLJMW", "B001M9ELQ2", "6304698801", "0783225725", "B003ASLJMM", "B003AWRM9M", "B00005LC4R", "B004IB04NK", "B00007GZRI", "B003ASLJJU", "0792839056", "B00008CMT4", "0783228007", "B000N3SSBW", "B0001FVDK0", "B0015XHQT4", "B003AWRMCO", "B004MYFVQ8", "B003ASLJS6", "B00DZFKNFO", "B003ASLJPE", "B003ASLJIQ", "B001CT876W", "B0003JANSW", "B00000K0DM", "B0007ZEOC8", "B003AWRMBA", "B003ASLJJK", "B003ASLJRC", "B003AT9CJ8", "B0015XHQTY", "B0015XHQU8", "B00AEFY9YY", "B00004ZBVH", "B000HT38CQ", "6304698798", "0792835727", "0792838947", "B000063UR5", "B000S88JT8", "B00013RC8O", "B004QBWU02", "B001NFNFNU", "B001T21R50", "B003AWRMCE", "B0052SO0LK", "B00BTYRB58", "B00AEFYPHA", "B00005N89K", "B000EHSVR8", "B003ASLJOU", "B0007TKNH4", "B003B3NV8G", "B0045HCJKS", "B00005YUNO", "B0034G4OXQ", "B000A2WJBQ", "B00AMQGB6O", "B00005JP3T", "B00004XPPC", "B005OK0YRK", "B00005K9LL", "B00005IA7Z", "B003ASLJQS", "B000O599YY", "B00AEFY5GQ", "B00028HBIE", "B00F8G4OGC", "B00062IVM6", "B0019UGYK0", "B00000K0DR", "B00388PK7O", "B0043X1FLS", "B005ETAL5Q", "B00FJYXP36", "B0009X770E", "B008FYZIZK", "B006OFN0SE", "B002Z7FWBI", "B00D6I7IYY", "B003ASLJLS", "B00A33J8UW", "B0000694WH", "B0006TPDPM", "B00JPQ1I7O"], "bought_together": ["B00AEFXVOI", "B003AWRM9W"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003ASLJNQ", "B001M9ELQ2", "B00AEFXVOI", "B003ASLJRC"]}, "price": 86.49, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 25417}, "asin": "0792845838", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ubfLtR9zL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Thunderbolt and Lightfoot"}

{"description": "This strange, 1985 experiment by Ridley Scott (Blade Runner) starred the up-and-coming Tom Cruise in a fairy-tale world of dwarfs and unicorns and demons. After the horn of a unicorn is broken, darkness and winter descend upon the world. Cruise's character, helped along by a magic sprite played by David Bennent (The Tin Drum), descends into hell to save paradise. This movie is almost a classic case of art direction gone amok. The somewhat amorphous Cruise doesn't lend much dramatic focus or artistic definition, but the drama between Tim Curry's satanic majesty and Mia Sara's character, who becomes a sort of princess of the netherworld, is pretty captivating. A mixed experience all around that makes one wish it had been more successful.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00000JPH5", "6303212395", "B00000JPH4", "6300248100", "6303257674", "B00005OLY5", "6304509154", "079073463X", "0790700506", "630196649X", "6300214087", "0792845684", "6300182878", "0790705141", "6304994540", "6302182522", "0800135954"], "bought_together": ["B00000JPH5"], "also_viewed": ["B0000014XE", "B0000687KA", "B00IJUIY60"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 237584}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 10.99, "brand": "", "asin": "1558807381", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31HNRKDKT8L.gif", "title": "Legend [VHS]"}
{"description": "It seemed like a pretty good career move, and for the most part it was.  Demi Moore will never top any rational list of great actresses, but as her career stalled in the mid-1990s she had enough internal fire and external physicality to be just right for her title role inG.I. Jane. Her character's name isn't Jane--it's Jordan O'Neil--but the fact that she lacks a penis makes her an immediate standout in her elite training squad of Navy SEALs. She's been recruited as the first female SEAL trainee through a series of backroom political maneuvers, and must prove her military staying power against formidable odds--not the least of which is the abuse of a tyrannical master chief (Viggo Mortensen) who puts her through hell to improve her chances of success. Within the limitations of a glossy star vehicle, director Ridley Scott manages to incorporate the women-in-military issue with considerable impact, and Moore--along with her conspicuous breast enhancements and that memorable head-shaving scene--jumps into the role with everything she's got. Not a great movie by any means, but definitely a rousing crowd pleaser, and it's worth watching just to hear Demi shout the words &quot;Suck my ----!!&quot; (rhymes with &quot;chick&quot;).--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0045HCIYA", "B000F6IODE", "B00005B6JZ", "6304696558", "B00005JA9F", "6304765258", "B000KF0GWW", "B00005Y1UX", "B00000G3PA", "B000N3SRO0", "6304711891", "0792159659", "B00AEBBA36", "B0000542CK", "0790730979", "B00AEFXT1S", "B00081U7HC", "B00003CXGV", "6304806434", "B00AEFXR1K", "B00003CXTG", "B0002WZTOI", "B000065U1N", "B00003CXFV", "B000095WW8", "B0045HCJFS", "B000JYW5BE", "B002AT8K9W", "B003ASLJOU", "B0006N2EZ0", "B00AEFY4CG", "0767810872", "B00004STDN", "B002O3Z4WK", "B001B3LIOC", "B000CEV3M8", "B00AEFXX9Q", "B000U1ZV8K", "B0007KIFGE", "B004GJYRK0", "B001680M26", "B00008EYA5", "6305236569", "B00AEBB86U", "B000KGGIZK", "B002O3Z50G", "079284646X", "0783225733", "1558908846", "6305128952", "B0009UZG3C", "B00AEFYUQQ", "0790736411", "B002NZK5VO", "B00003CXHJ", "B002NZK5UU", "0790732149", "6304711905", "6305428506", "B00004WG2F", "B00096S49Y", "B00001ZWUS", "B000FI8MPW", "B00AEFXYJA", "B002GHHHJC", "0767817745", "B0002V7OI8", "0780618548", "B00AEFY0F2", "B006TTC5HC", "B000QUCRB4", "B00005JK8K", "B000PMFS2I", "B000ENC5YW", "B00HEPE6MM", "0783225547", "B00004XPPG", "6305213283", "B00005JPD0", "B002VWNID6", "B00007E2F5", "0767811100", "B005LAIGYQ", "0767815122", "B000DZIGDU", "B000274T94", "0783240295", "B00AZNEW5G", "B00006HAWN", "B0045HCJ5S", "B000O599YO", "B0068FZ0O2", "0767821769", "B00AEFXZJE", "B00009WVSL", "B000P0J0CY", "B00AEFXYOA", "B000P0J0C4", "B004SIP7ZS", "B003ASLJIQ"], "bought_together": ["B0045HCIYA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005B6JZ", "B00003CXPP", "6304696558", "B00DV2MVWO"]}, "price": 4.98, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 7428}, "asin": "1558908315", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51WE3PRTH1L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "G.I.

{"description": "Criterion's release of Martin Scorsese'sThe Last Temptation of Christeffectively presents both the film's beauty and controversy. Produced on an extremely tight budget,The Last Temptation of Christhas a very epic feel that is wonderfully captured on this DVD. Though a few specks and scratches are apparent throughout the 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen presentation, the overall visual quality is quite sharp and vibrant. The newly mastered Dolby Digital 5.1 track is a phenomenal improvement, noticeably enhancing ambient sounds, dialogue, and Peter Gabriel's moving soundtrack. There are various added extras that really put the f'lm&#x92;s content into perspective.  The stellar commentary track includes director Martin Scorsese, star Willem Dafoe, screenwriter Paul Schrader, and film critic Jay Cocks candidly discussing various aspects of the production, including the initial obstacles, extensive research, and notorious controversial elements.  This is a great DVD for fans and an informative one for those who wish to see past its notoriety.--Rob Bracco", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00028HBKM", "B001BSBBIU", "B00006RCNV", "B002AT8KBU", "068485256X", "B0000633QW", "B000CZ0O54", "B0002BO05S", "B000WC39ZY", "B002Z2X7GK", "B000286RNE", "B00028HBIO", "B00005JNGA", "B000286RPM", "B004499LWG", "B00BTYMPX6", "B00005UM2Y", "0767827929", "B000A2UBN4", "B000035Z5G", "6305090580", "B0006Q93ZG", "B0006GAOJA", "B001NSLE5I", "B003ZZAXEK", "B001BEK8E2", "B0057GYODG", "B0001XALGY", "B000VE439Y", "B00005QAPH", "0783225903", "B000286RO8", "B00008WJD9", "B003NXH2TS", "B00007AJF8", "B000LP6KNU", "B00005AUKD", "B005KQVE1S", "B00AEBBACM", "B000067IZ3", "B001WLMOL4", "B003KGBISE", "B004VJJF34", "B00L3PA8P8", "B00062IVL2", "B00007CVS2", "B00005UQ7T", "B000286RR0", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B00005V1WY", "B000286RP2", "B00AEBB8NI", "B00339VUYU", "B002U6DVPS", "B00080ZG10", "B00000F3CD", "B00AEFY9RG", "B001IHJ988", "B000G8NXYG", "B00JBGSHSQ", "B00014K5V4", "B0007M2234", "B0002KQNKE", "0780022343", "B0057GYOBI", "B0024EWP6W", "B00ICWO144", "B0050FXDDQ", "0783229526", "B00HFWETSA", "B000MGB6NM", "B000TXNDV6", "B00000CQJZ", "B003UM8T3A", "B00AEFXQ9S", "B00H9L28OO", "B00HRYH6GI", "B001JNNDGA", "B000C20VPA", "B000063JDE", "B006TTC5A4", "B00H9KKGTO", "B0002KPHZG", "B00000IQC0", "B0014FAIZC", "B001EOQCMG", "B00ALTQRUC", "0670038458", "B000056NX5", "B00005JN8Z", "B00AMSM9CW", "0767830555", "B000F7CEC0", "B004WPYO7E", "B00H9HZITU", "B0009298N4", "B0047P5FU4", "0025419498", "B000P0J09M", "B003LR5BD0"], "bought_together": ["B00028HBKM", "B0000633QW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00028HBKM", "B0000633QW", "B0002BO05S", "B002AT8KBU"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 76534}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 24.99, "brand": "Image Entertainment", "asin": "1559409037", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/517ZJYRYZ7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Last Temptation of Christ (The Criterion Collection)"}

{"description": "The Tommyknockersis a TV miniseries based on Stephen King's 1987  novel.  An alien spacecraft has been buried beneath the Burning Woods near the small rural New England community of Haven for millions of years, but has now by chance been unearthed by Bobbi (Marg Helgenberger) while digging around in the woods behind her house.  The structure in the woods begins to exert a glowing-green influence on the town, causing the people to invent Rube Goldberg-like gizmos, develop the gift of telepathy, lose their teeth, and form a hive-mind mentality bent on digging up the ship and revivifying the desiccated aliens within.  Luckily, Bobbi's significant other is an alcoholic poet (Jimmy Smits) who needs to learn to face his fears.  He also has a metal plate in his head that prevents the hive-minders from reading his thoughts and makes him immune to the neon-green influence of the aliens. Ultimately, it's up to him to save the day.  Although the acting is topnotch, especially from Smits and Helgenberger, and there are plenty of gooseflesh moments, there are also enough plot holes here to fuel a very long and enjoyable evening's conversation.  Why do the aliens start in at this time, when they've been causing legends in the woods for ages?  Where does an alien ship buried for ages get all that dry ice?  How does the Smits character make a living as a poet?  One suspects that King's fine sense of New England characterizations is given short shrift here, and that the woods in his mind teem with more alien thoughts than the TV miniseries form could embody.  Welcome appearances by congenial actors abound, notably Joanna Cassidy, E.G. Marshall and Robert Carradine.  And there's a slutty postal letter-carrier played authentically by Traci Lords.--Jim Gay", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000G1R39E", "B000068IES", "1573625779", "B000053UIF", "B00BW4S87U", "0792841328", "B00005O439", "B000RZIGUE", "B000GYI340", "B0000C2IQQ", "B006J8NPAE", "B000063US5", "B000U1ZV6W", "6305645574", "B00005UQ9V", "B00AEBB91O", "B0001FVDQ4", "B00006FDCD", "B00000F3SB", "B00009OWI3", "B00005LQ0Q", "B00BW4S8AC", "B0002OXVG4", "6305120021", "6305899398", "B00A1AU72A", "B0007WFXNA", "0767821599", "B00AEBB91E", "B008QE9Z8A", "B0002A2VK0", "B0007NFMB2", "B0010X73ZG", "B000GBEWRU", "B002NZK5SM", "B0002O7XW2", "B00AEFYV9W", "B003L2M584", "B00AEFXR8I", "0790742829", "B00030AZCK", "0792842960", "B000077VRT", "B000069I05", "6304604572", "B00BTYPW7C", "B00006FDCU", "B0053TWV46", "6304936397", "B0033HKCV4", "1573626910", "B000TJ6PBK", "B000H4JH7Q", "0451156609", "B0053TWVDC", "B00BW4S89S", "0792846443", "B00005K3NR", "630523650X", "B0002234LS", "B005CFBZVG", "B0084MVE7E", "B00GNAO70K", "B002GHHHG0", "B002VWNIDG", "B006CXIKYC", "B00302QF72", "1573623911", "B00L22H2IS", "B00003CXIP", "B00DII0MGI", "B00A1AU702", "B00APQLJTA", "0767802497", "B00AKGG828", "B00009PY4G", "B000056T5E", "B00009QG7O", "B002AZTYPA", "B000PFUAP0", "B003WTO5NO", "B00000IQC4", "B00005JOJE", "B0052XU4BK", "B000AM6OQ2", "B000V4UFZK", "B00003CWRF", "B00AEFY2WI", "B000MX7V3O", "B001B8XRT6", "B000G1ALDY", "B002KH4KSY", "B005CFBZWK", "0792839706", "B00DTPRZ10", "B00AEFY1V0", "6305090564", "B0001WTVUW", "B00003L9CQ", "B00008EY9G"], "bought_together": ["B00006FDCD", "B000063US5"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00006FDCD", "B00BW4S8AC", "1573625779", "B00000F3SB"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 84728}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 34.95, "brand": "SMITS,JIMMY", "asin": "1573624098", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GN4TETESL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Tommyknockers"}

{"description": "The movie that made \"No wire hangers!\" a household phrase,Mommie Dearestis the very model of a modern \"camp classic,\" so crazily outlandish that it's fascinating. Based on the scathing and scandalous tell-all bestseller by Christina Crawford, the adopted daughter of histrionic Hollywood movie queen Joan Crawford,Mommie Dearestwas billed in advance as a serious dramatic motion-picture biography. But it turned out to be something much, much weirder--a genuine Hollywood oddity that serves up a bizarre mixture of melodramatic trash and outrageous tragi-comedy. Joan Crawford won an Oscar for playing the role of the self-sacrificing mother, the woman who would do anything for her daughter, inMildred Pierce. As depicted by Faye Dunaway (playing the hell out of the role as if she's determined to win another Oscar of her own, damn it!), her role as offscreen parent puts her in a league with big-time scary screen mommies such as Mrs. Bates inPsycho, and Angela Lansbury's &uuml;ber-mom inThe Manchurian Candidate. Dunaway's Crawford torments and terrorizes her adopted children in myriad ways--making them give away their own birthday gifts and rousting them from their beds for frantic after-midnight bathroom-scrubbing attacks. And when, after the death of her Pepsico chairman husband, Crawford tells the board of directors, \"Don't f--- with me, fellas!\" one is very much inclined to heed her warning.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301706587", "6301977963", "B004LWZW4M", "B000005XPV", "6304359721", "6301973410", "B000003KE0", "B00005RERY"], "bought_together": ["6301977963"], "also_viewed": ["0767903579"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 304567}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.67, "brand": "", "asin": "6300213919", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51N957ZKB0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Mommie Dearest [VHS]"}
{"description": "Like a soda pop left open all night,Buellerseems to have lost its effervescence over time. Sure, Matthew Broderick is still appealing as the perennial truant, Ferris, who fakes his parents out and takes one memorable day off from school. Jeffrey Jones is nasty and scheming as the principal who's out to catch him. Jennifer Grey is winning as Ferris's sister (who ends up making out in the police station with a prophetic vision of Charlie Sheen).

{"description": "\"I'm not a drinker--I'm a drunk.\" These words, and the serious message behind them, were still potent enough in 1945 to shock audiences flocking toThe Lost Weekend. The speaker is Don Birnam (Ray Milland), a handsome, talented, articulate alcoholic. The writing team of producer Charles Brackett and director Billy Wilder pull no punches in their depiction of Birnam's massive weekend bender, a tailspin that finds him reeling from his favorite watering hole to Bellevue Hospital. Location shooting in New York helps the street-level atmosphere, especially a sequence in which Birnam, a budding writer, tries to hock his typewriter for booze money. He desperately staggers past shuttered storefronts--it's Yom Kippur, and the pawnshops are closed. Milland, previously known as a lightweight leading man (he'd starred in Wilder's hilariousThe Major and the Minorthree years earlier), burrows convincingly under the skin of the character, whether waxing poetic about the escape of drinking or screaming his lungs out in the D.T.'s sequence. Wilder, having just made the ultra-noirDouble Indemnity, brought a new kind of frankness and darkness to Hollywood's treatment of a social problem. At first the film may have seemed too bold; Paramount Pictures nearly killed the release of the picture after it tested poorly with preview audiences. But once in release,The Lost Weekendbecame a substantial hit, and won four Oscars: for picture, director, screenplay, and actor.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302413435", "6300269310", "B0045HCJ08", "0783217390", "6302801133", "6302226899", "1558807780", "0792839846", "6302730023"], "bought_together": ["6300269310"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 318451}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.51, "brand": "", "asin": "6301005740", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51BYDFD7C2L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Lost Weekend [VHS]"}
{"description": "Holly Hunter plays a network news producer who, much to her chagrin, finds herself falling for pretty-boy anchorman William Hurt. He is all glamour without substance and represents a hated shift from hard news toward packaged \"infotainment,\" which Hunter despises. Completing the triangle is Albert Brooks, who provides contrast as the gifted reporter with almost no presence on camera. He carries a torch for Hunter; she sees merely a friend. Written and directed by James L. Brooks, this shows remarkable insight into the people who make television. On the surface it is about that love triangle. If you look a little deeper, however, you will see that this behind-the-scenes comedy is a very revealing look at obsessive behavior and the heightened emotions that accompany adrenaline addiction. It is for good reason this was nominated for seven Academy Awards (though it did not win any). There are scenes in this movie you cannot shake, such as Hunter's scheduled mini-breakdowns, or Brooks's furious \"flop sweat\" during his tryout as a national anchor.

{"description": "Writer-director Preston Sturges's third feature, 1941'sSullivan's Travels, remains the antic auteur's most ambitious screen effort. Having added the producer's stripe to his duties, Sturges combines breezy romantic comedy, arch Hollywood satire, and social essay into a single, screwball story line.The titular pilgrim is John L. Sullivan (Joel McCrea), an Ivy League grad who's enjoyed a meteoric rise as the director behind escapist movies likeAnts in Your Pants of 1938, but is now determined to raise his sights toward more exalted, serious-minded cinematic art. His proposed breakthrough, portentously titledO Brother, Where Art Thou?, elicits a studio response closer to \"Oh, brother,\" given the director's utter lack of first-hand experience on the wrong side of the tracks.Instead of capitulating, Sullivan sets off disguised as a tramp, ready to meet life's crueler lessons face-to-face--albeit followed at a discreet distance by a motor home filled with studio handlers and reporters. His ludicrous odyssey may give the boy director no real insight, but it gives Sturges the chance to inject some reliably fine gags and a romantic subplot featuring the luminous Veronica Lake. It's at this juncture that Sturges the writer's darker objective throws a jolting shift in tone. Suffice it to say that just when a comic, upbeat denouement seems imminent, Sullivan travels instead from the sunlit California of the comedy's early reels toward a darker, relentlessly downbeat world influenced more by the social realism of the movies the hero desperately wants to make. By the final reel, Sturges has flirted with real tragedy, turning his conclusion into a meditation on his own seemingly carefree, dizzily comic art.--Sam Sutherland", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0001ZMXAY", "1558802010", "6300270068", "6301586034", "6300185125", "630196585X"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 282671}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6301232291", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41QKDMDZGKL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Sullivan's Travels [VHS]"}
{"description": "Special effects took a clever step forward with the release of  Paramount'sDr. Cyclopsin 1940. This wasn't the first movie to deal with  the miniaturization of human beings (The Bride of FrankensteinandThe Devil Dolladdressed  the issue earlier), but it was the first to devote its visual effects to depicting the dangers of being tiny in a full-scale world. Introducing themes and images that would later be perfected inThe Incredible  Shrinking Man, the story is set in a remote Peruvian jungle, where the bald, bespectacled mad scientist Dr. Thorkel (Albert Dekker) uses his secret \"radium machine\" to reduce humans to one-fifth normal size.When two American explorers stumble upon the doctor's lab, they're captured and shrunken, suddenly finding that cats, chickens, and even raindrops now pose a deadly threat to their survival. The doctor and his experiments must be destroyed, and the film winds down to a predictable conclusion.Dr. Cyclopsis now merely a curio for science fiction fans, but it's blessed with the same spirit of adventure and innovation that was gloriously evident in director Ernest B. Schoedsack's best-known previous film, the originalKing  Kong. Photographed in three-strip Technicolor,Dr. Cyclopsearned an Academy Award nomination for its  visual effects (losing the Oscar toThe Thief of Baghdad), and  remains an enjoyable milestone in imaginative cinema.--Jeff Shannon", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 347064}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "title": "Dr Cyclops [VHS]", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B000VX9WB4", "B008RU595Q", "B0039BUKOI", "6302763916", "6303046495", "B0013XZ6SY"]}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51TYVWJYP0L._SY300_.jpg", "asin": "6301257049"}
{"description": "This big, boisterous adventure is more inspired by than based on Rudyard Kipling's famous poem. Legendary screenwriters Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur have fashioned a rousing Hollywood movie full of high adventure, knockabout comedy, and old-fashioned male bonding. And old-fashioned it is: the trio of British officers and best friends who form the core of the film are a 19th-century three musketeers in India, threatened by the interventions of a woman who means to marry the dashing Ballantine (Douglas Fairbanks Jr.). Blustery commander MacChesney (Victor McLaglen) schemes to keep Ballantine in the army while his second in command, the treasure-hunting Cutter (Cary Grant in a hopelessly mugging comic performance), continues searching for his elusive mother lode, but all their plans are thrown into chaos when the rise of the bloodthirsty Thugs threaten Britannia's soldiers. Sam Jaffe takes up the rear guard in turban, loin, and full-body make-up as the titular Gunga Din, the loyal water carrier who dreams of becoming a soldier. Bombastically chauvinist and naively imperialist, the film is bound to rub some people wrong, but Stevens creates a thrilling spectacle in the grand Hollywood mold, a handsome, exciting classic comic adventure that helped make 1939 Hollywood's grandest year.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["6304429274", "6301977165", "6301449142", "B0000524DN", "B00008FECE", "6301564472", "B0000040EO", "B000A9QK8M", "6301977149", "0790743159", "B002YAO1A4", "B000056PNU", "6301964209", "6300987485", "1559600136", "6300215741", "6301278437", "6301964012", "B000PYKZYC", "6303382940", "6302120624", "0800116917", "B00BGARG46", "6301978315", "630197638X"], "bought_together": ["6301449142"], "also_viewed": ["6301449177"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 378014}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.12, "brand": "RKO Collection", "asin": "6301327756", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/412QQ7CCB2L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Gunga Din [VHS]"}

After a fabulously successful season on TV, the campy comic book adventure hit the big screen, complete with painful puns, outrageous supervillains, and fights punctuated with word balloons sporting such onomatopoeic syllables as \"Pow!,\" \"Thud!,\" and \"Blammo!\" Adam West's wooden Batman is the cowled vigilante alter ego of straight-arrow millionaire Bruce Wayne and Bruce Ward's Robin (a.k.a.

Together they battle an unholy alliance of Gotham City's greatest criminals: the Joker (Cesar Romero, whooping up a storm), the Riddler (giggling Frank Gorshin), the Penguin (cackling Burgess Meredith), and the purr-fectly sexy Catwoman (Lee Meriwether slinking in a skin-tight black bodysuit). The criminals are, naturally, out to conquer the world, but with a little help from their unending supply of utility belt devices (bat shark repellent, anyone?), our dynamic duo thwarts their nefarious plans at every turn. Since the TV show ran under 30 minutes an episode (with commercials), the 105-minute film runs a little thin--a little camp goes a long way--but fans of the small-screen show will enjoy the spoofing tone throughout.

{"description": "Steve Martin plays Arthur, a '30s-era traveling sheet-music salesman whose marriage is bleak and who embarks on a fateful affair with a teacher (an amazing Bernadette Peters). Arthur's dreary world is juxtaposed with Busby Berkeley-styled musical production numbers that showcase Martin's and Peters's versatility. Arthur's world is desperate, sad, and only the more so when directly compared to the musical numbers. But it does work and it is affecting.This dark, yet simultaneously ebullient film written by Dennis Potter is capable of presenting such polar-opposite visuals and emotion. Until this film, Martin was best known for his comedic albums, and for 1979'sThe Jerk. In other words,Pennies' disappointing box office can be accredited to audiences' inability to accept a dark Martin in the early 1980s.  If Martin's dancing ability comes as a surprise, an even greater revelation is Christopher Walken in a sexy stripping tap-dancing number.

{"description": "Two of the juiciest roles in the American theater fall at the feet of Spencer Tracy and Fredric March, and both men make a meal of it.Inherit the Wind, based on the play by Jerome Lawrence and Robert E. Lee, is a slightly fictionalized account of the Scopes Monkey Trial, that galvanizing legal drama of the 1920s. When a young Tennessee teacher is prosecuted for teaching the theory of evolution in a public school, he receives unwanted public attention as well as the legal advice of a giant. Tracy plays the role based on Clarence Darrow, the eloquent defense attorney, and March storms his way through a part based on Williams Jennings Bryan, the failed presidential candidate (and famed orator) who prosecuted the case. Gene Kelly plays a character based on the acid-penned H.L. Mencken, reporting on the trial and caustically commenting on the absurdity of the human animal. Stanley (Judgment at Nuremberg) Kramer's direction is not especially subtle, but the verbal fireworks unleashed during the trial sequences are still stirring. Even the different styles of the actors are intriguing: March is all mannerism and false padding around the belly, while Tracy does his patented naturalistic grumbling. It would be nice if this story were a quaint period piece, but its issues and arguments keep reemerging in the headlines with each new generation.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792837967", "B0000EYUCK", "B0010YSD7W", "B002NZK5VO", "0800100832", "B004FQX5B6", "6301628454", "6303402070", "630438100X", "6302353785", "6300215962", "0792838556", "B003MG6FJY", "630197803X", "630396155X", "1555265952", "6303057225", "B000A1KF8Q", "6301412796", "6302098424", "B000EO7AIC", "6301647734", "630197638X"], "bought_together": ["0792837967"], "also_viewed": ["B003B3NV6I"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 260813}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6302120624", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51D8EEZ5TZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Inherit the Wind [VHS]"}

No matter how you define it, Ridley Scott's 1991 box-office hit pinched a nerve and made the cover of national news magazines for tweaking gender politics like no movie before or since. Callie Khouri's screenplay overhauls the buddy formula with its story about two best friends (Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis) who embark on a liberating adventure that turns into an interstate police chase after a traumatic incident makes both women into fugitives; they are en route to a destiny they could never have imagined.

To protect what she loves, she collects two petty criminals, a wisecracking hired hand, and a hired killer, Kid Shelleen (Lee Marvin). Unfortunately, Shelleen is a raging drunk who is so inebriated and unsteady with a gun he literally misses the broad side of a barn. However, Cat, has, as they used to say in those days, a mind of her own, and she masterminds a spectacular train heist that puts them all on the lam. Marvin won an Academy Award for his role as the derelict Shelleen, and his performances (he actually has two) are still topnotch and on target.

{"description": "Star Trek Vleft us nowhere to go but up, and with the return ofStar Trek IIdirector Nicholas Meyer,Star Trek VIrestored the movie series to its classic blend of space opera, intelligent plotting, and engaging interaction of stalwart heroes and menacing villains. Borrowing its subtitle (and several lines of dialogue) from Shakespeare, the movie finds Admiral Kirk (William Shatner) and his fellowEnterprisecrew members on a diplomatic mission to negotiate peace with the revered Klingon Chancellor Gorkon (David Warner). When the high-ranking Klingon and several officers are ruthlessly murdered, blame is placed on Kirk, whose subsequent investigation uncovers an assassination plot masterminded by the nefarious Klingon General Chang (Christopher Plummer) in an effort to disrupt a historic peace summit. As this political plot unfolds,Star Trek VItakes on a sharp-edged tone, with Kirk and Spock confronting their opposing views of diplomacy, and testing their bonds of loyalty when a Vulcan officer is revealed to be a traitor. With a dramatic depth befitting what was to be the final movie mission of the originalStar Trekcrew, this film took the veteran cast out in respectably high style.

{"description": "This silky smooth film noir pits gruff police detective Dana Andrews, stiff and blunt in his street-bred manners, against a cultured columnist and acidic wit (Clifton Webb at his prissiest) in a battle of wits during a murder investigation. The cop is a romantic hiding under a hard-boiled exterior who falls in love with the beautiful victim through the portrait that hangs in her apartment. Gene Tierney, whose heart-shaped face mixes the exotic with the girl next door, brings the poise and calm of a model to her role as the object of every man's gaze and the target of a killer.Laura, handsomely shot in dreamy black and white, is the first and best of Otto Preminger's cool, controlled murder mysteries. In the gritty world of film noir it remains the most refined and elegant example of the genre, but under the tasteful decor and high-society fashions lies a world seething in jealousy, passion, blackmail, and murder. Vincent Price costars as a blithe gigolo and David Raksin's lush theme has become a wistful romantic standard.--Sean Axmaker", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 231608}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "title": "Laura [VHS]", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303364772", "6301973410", "6301586042", "6302732964", "B0000040EO", "6301969316", "6302413435", "6304056915", "6301670140", "6300183890", "6300183513", "B0000068EE", "B00003OSTO", "6301797957", "6301798503", "6300215741", "0792840836", "B0000048YO", "6301976932", "6300215644", "6301586050", "6304039530", "6302226899", "B000E6ESWG", "0782006779", "6301670159", "6302413451", "0790743531", "B001ARDBXU", "0783215096", "6301586026", "6301964012", "6301971647", "6300183912", "6302800897", "630197879X", "0792107683", "6302224411", "6303120504", "B00004TX24", "6301967070", "B000BWIZRW", "6300181111", "1558807780", "6304056869", "B006P0UQ2G", "6302842263", "6300251152", "6302806348", "079284517X", "0800113055", "6303560067", "6300216721", "6301978536", "0792840844", "6301973380", "0783236352", "6302363292", "6301978315", "6304119097", "6301978706", "6304383169", "B000021Y6M", "6303957013", "6300181278", "6302305950", "B00000JKNL", "0800100832", "0783221347", "6301797906", "078200847X", "0783217390", "6302278929", "6302120535", "6302450179", "6303333079", "6301973089", "6301975987", "6305012792", "B00000F3UB", "6301967682", "0790743213", "6301798759", "6301661826", "6301628454", "630196912X", "B000006N70", "1558804226", "B000021Y6K", "6300208133", "6301965620", "6302787033", "6301578805", "6301491920", "0792837649", "6304359705", "6301969081", "6303364748", "6302360978", "6302309751"], "also_viewed": ["B000083C6R", "B002GSXKQA", "B0086IMNRQ", "6300207919", "6301969316", "B002VWNIAY", "6300183513", "0792839846"]}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GSB8Q42DL._SY300_.jpg", "asin": "630266232X"}
{"description": "EDITOR'S NOTE: According to a Warner Home Video technician involved in  the production ofThe Stanley Kubrick Collection, Kubrick authorized all aspects of theCollection, from the use of Digital Component Video (or \"D-1\") masters originally approved in 1989, to the use of minimalist screen menus, chapter stops, and (in the case of2001: A Space OdysseyandThe Shiningon DVD) supplementary materials. Full-screen presentation ofThe ShiningandFull Metal Jacketwas also approved by Kubrick, who recomposed his original framing,  reportedly believing that those films looked best on video in the full-screen format. (In fact, the original theatrical aspect ratio ofThe Shiningwas 1.66:1, meaning that a relatively small portion of the image is lost.) Kubrick also chose mono over stereo,  believing that inconsistencies in theatrical sound systems resulted in loss of control over theatrical presentation. In every respect, the Warner spokesman  said, the films in theCollectionremain as Kubrick approved them. Any future attempt to remaster or alter them would  have to be approved by an appointee of the Kubrick estate.", "related": {"also_bought": ["0790705141", "0792839846", "6303402070", "0783221347", "0790731975", "0784011923", "6300182916", "6300216047", "0792842464", "6302360978", "6300185281", "6302054982", "6302120101", "B00005ATQA", "6305237115", "0790734079", "B001BZQMFA", "6300184110", "6300183416", "B00000J2L7", "B00000FZCU", "6300216500", "B000AMW2TK", "6301564456", "6300247171", "B00000JGEK", "630442972X", "B00005B238", "0790758474", "0790733927", "6303953425", "0783217528", "0792845684", "B00004W5UA", "0767825411", "6304429274", "6300183092", "6305363668", "0790734877", "B00000JRUB", "0783235607"], "bought_together": ["0790705141"], "also_viewed": ["B001993Y1S", "B008M4MB8K", "B00337QJO8", "B00GGAK0FS", "B00108E1GU", "B006JVPK2M", "6302610702", "B008MILL8C", "6300214826", "B001AQO3QA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 369746}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6302760046", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514N60SRJ4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]"}

His career is destroyed when his superior and secondary suspect Raymond Horgan (Brian Dennehy) sets him up for the fall. Bonnie Bedelia plays Rusty's wife Barbara, who is not above suspicion herself.

{"description": "A champion of illumination and experimental shading, Kurosawa brings his unerring eye for indelible images to Shakespeare in this 1957 adaptation ofMacbeth. By changing the locale from Birnam Wood to 16th-century Japan, Kurosawa makes an oddball argument for the trans-historicity of Shakespeare's narrative; and indeed, stripped to the bare mechanics of the plot, the tale of cutthroat ambition rewarded (and thwarted) feels infinitely adaptable. What's lost in the translation, of course, is the force and beauty of the language--much of the script ofThrone of Bloodis maddeningly repetitive or superfluous--but striking visual images (including the surreal Cobweb Forest and some extremely artful gore) replace the sublime poetry. Toshiro Mifune is theatrically intense as Washizu, the samurai fated to betray his friend and master in exchange for the prestige of nobility; he portrays the ill-fated warrior with a passion bordering on violence, and a barely concealed conviviality. Somewhat less successful is Isuzu Yamada as Washizu's scheming wife; her poise and creepy impassivity, chilling at first, soon grows tedious. Kurosawa himself is the star of the show, though, and his masterful use of black-and-white contrast-- not to mention his steady, dramatic hand with a battle scene--keeps the proceedings thrilling. A must-see for fans of Japanese cinema, as well as all you devotees of samurai weapons and armor.--Miles Bethany", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302969697", "0780018702", "6303202055", "630296931X"], "also_viewed": ["6303202055", "6302919649", "0780021185", "1572522089"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 431622}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.94, "brand": "", "asin": "6302891272", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5196QE0Y8NL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Throne of Blood [VHS]"}

Since that's the case, it's fortunate that Williams is Williams, and his performance is terribly funny at times and exceptionally believable in those scenes where his character misses his children. Playing Williams's brother, a professional makeup artist, Harvey Fierstein has a good support role in a bright sequence where he tries a number of feminine looks on Williams before settling on Mrs. Doubtfire's visage.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302091632", "6302800420", "6303257844", "6302765536", "630339406X", "B00329TVQA", "6302581907", "6303140157", "6300247236", "6304416415", "B00004XPQQ", "B000005PFL", "0800196767", "B000008IPR", "0783230893", "B000007OY0", "6304500718", "6302089654", "6303409997", "6300213668", "630273973X", "6304311834", "6302426200"], "bought_together": ["6302800420"], "also_viewed": ["0792151712", "6302961572", "6303314015", "6304233639", "0788806270", "0788812408", "B00005JKDQ", "6304290888", "6303983812", "0788812807", "6302765536", "155890641X", "6305229449", "0788805843", "0788811002", "B00003CXXI", "B00003CXQX", "6301966988", "6304089767", "0790727382", "6303402348", "6304500831", "B0000DCGT1", "6305326940", "5554458521", "6302091632", "6304401132", "B00007J88X"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 106101}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.95, "brand": "20th Century Fox", "asin": "6303049079", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51lvoybRsfL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Mrs Doubtfire [VHS]"}
{"description": "This Western has become a modest cult favorite since its release in 1993, when the film was met with mixed reviews but the performances of Kurt Russell (as Wyatt Earp) and especially Val Kilmer, for his memorably eccentric performance as the dying gunslinger Doc Holliday, garnered high praise. The movie opens with Wyatt Earp trying to put his violent past behind him, living happily in Tombstone with his brothers and the woman (Dana Delany) who puts his soul at ease. But a murderous gang called the Cowboys has burst on the scene, and Earp can't keep his gun belt off any longer. The plot sounds routine, and in many ways it is, but Western buffs won't mind a bit thanks to a fine cast and some well-handled action on the part ofRambodirector George P. Cosmatos, who has yet to make a better film than this.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303269826", "6302415853", "B000E5N6LG", "B003AWRMCE", "B00000JGEI", "6302130379", "B00AEBB932", "6302256682", "6305576173", "630281622X", "1573622419", "6304457324", "6301976983", "6303953425", "6300268470", "6303506291", "B000007OY0", "6300182304", "6300183211", "6304414099", "B000005PFL", "6304286961", "0792836510", "6300214826", "6300213005", "0790705141", "0790701251", "6304140851", "B00004WIDB", "0790735431", "6300214567", "6301300556", "0800132009", "6304039522"], "bought_together": ["6303269826"], "also_viewed": ["B000E5N6LG", "B00000K3AN", "6304401132", "6303314015"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 193150}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.97, "brand": "", "asin": "6303109950", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/511KKFBE5JL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Tombstone [VHS]"}
{"description": "This is the movie that Leonardo DiCaprio received an Oscar nomination for, five years beforeTitanic. And, in fact, this is the movie that should have made him a star, he's so good in it. Based on the novel by Peter Hedges (who adapted his own book) and directed by Lasse Hallstr&ouml;m (My Life as a Dog), this is the funny, moody tale of a young man named Gilbert Grape (Johnny Depp) who lives at home in a small town with his 500-pound Momma (beautifully played by nonpro Darlene Cates), his mentally retarded younger brother Arnie (DiCaprio, utterly convincing), and his sisters. Not a lot happens--Arnie keeps climbing a water tower and getting stuck; Gilbert is involved with a married woman (Mary Steenburgen), then meets a nice new girl in town who's closer to his age (Juliette Lewis). And that's exactly what makes this movie so much more than your run-of-the-mill Hollywood product: it's not about some mechanical, formulaic plot; it's about these characters, and it allows you to spend some time with them and get to know them. Depp may have started out as a TV teen idol on21 Jump Street, but his feature film choices since then--in such wonderfully offbeat and diverse movies asCry-Baby,Edward Scissorhands,Benny & Joon,Donnie Brasco--have made him one of the most interesting, unpredictable, and risk-taking young actors in American movies.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301763041", "630018403X"], "bought_together": ["6301763041"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 216191}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.79, "brand": "", "asin": "6303124798", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51APPGGETRL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "What's Eating Gilbert Grape [VHS]"}

{"description": "Edward D. Wood Jr. was an actor writer-director-producer, occasionally in drag, who combined meager bursts of talent with an undying optimism to create some of the most bizarrely memorable \"B\" movies to ever come out of Tinseltown. Though Wood died in obscurity as an alcoholic in 1978, his films have been considered cult classics for years. He is consistently voted the worst director who ever lived. You would think this an odd subject, but director Tim Burton harnesses the undying hopefulness that made Wood such a character. Shot in black and white, just like Wood's creations, this stylized, witty production captures the poetic absurdity of Wood's films and his unconventional life. Burton's recreation of Wood's wonderfully awfulPlan 9 from Outer Spacelooks much better than the original low-budget quickie. Burton tackled an extremely strange subject matter for a biopic, but Wood is presented as naive almost to the point of delusion, so the story works. The pace sags in the middle, as the weirdness starts to wear thin, but Depp proves himself an adroit actor, even while wearing angora and a blonde wig. Wood's unconventional repertoire company is faithfully reproduced, including an Academy Award-winning Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi. Landau is pathetic, droll, and charismatic as the elderly junkie who made his last screen appearances in Wood's films.--Rochelle O'Gorman", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301763041", "0800187873"], "bought_together": ["6301763041"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 314635}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.87, "brand": "", "asin": "6303407188", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51F97RJE9XL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Ed Wood [VHS]"}

The Rodgers and Hammerstein music, commissioned while Oklahoma was still making musical-theater history, feels tired too, like the result of a hastily written score. The state of Iowa just can't seem to inspire the same quality music as its more memorable, southern cousin. Remember that State Fair gem \"All I Owe Iowa\"?

{"description": "Ever since this convoluted thriller dazzled audiences and critics in 1995 and won an Oscar for Christopher McQuarrie's twisting screenplay,The Usual Suspectshas continued to divide movie lovers into opposite camps. While a lot of people take great pleasure from the movie's now-famous central mystery (namely, \"Who is Keyser S&ouml;ze?\"), others aren't so easily impressed by a movie that's too enamored of its own cleverness to make much sense. After all, what are we to make of a final scene that renders the entire movie obsolete? Half the fun ofThe Usual Suspectsis the debate it provokes and the sheer pleasure of watching its dynamic cast in action, led (or should we say, mislead) by Oscar-winner Kevin Spacey as the club-footed con man who recounts the saga of enigmatic Hungarian mobster Keyser S&ouml;ze. Spacey's in a band of thieves that includes Gabriel Byrne, Stephen Baldwin, Kevin Pollak, and Benicio Del Toro, all gathered in a plot to steal a large shipment of cocaine. The story is told in flashback as a twisted plot being described by Spacey's character to an investigating detective (Chazz Palmintieri), andThe Usual Suspectsis enjoyable for the way it keeps the viewer guessing right up to its surprise ending. Whether that ending will enhance or extinguish the pleasure is up to each viewer to decide. Even if it ultimately makes little or no sense at all, this is a funny and fiendish thriller, guaranteed to entertain even its vocal detractors.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0800125762", "0800125789", "6302935148", "0783222955", "B00005QATY", "B00003CWL5", "6304259131", "6300215741"], "also_viewed": ["6304140851"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 469637}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.0, "brand": "", "asin": "6303908306", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Z2K7HPEJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Usual Suspects, Letterbox Edition  [VHS]"}

What starts off as an accessible film turns into a prize only for those who likedEnchanted Apriland similar movies.--Doug Thomas", "price": 3.46, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 475494}, "asin": "6303980414", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Z30MVSKRL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Widows Peak [VHS]"}
{"description": "After the success ofJurassic Parkin 1993, the floodgates opened for digital special effects, andJumanjiis nothing if not a showcase for computer-generated creepiness guaranteed to give young children a nightmare or two. Whether that was the filmmakers' intention is up for debate, since this is a PG-rated adventure revolving around a mysterious board game that unleashes a terrifying jungle world upon its players, including gigantic spiders, huge mosquitoes, a stampede of rhinos, elephants, and every other jungle beast you can imagine. Robin Williams plays a man-child who's been trapped in the world of &quot;Jumanji&quot; for 26 years until he's freed by two kids who've discovered the game and released its parade of dangerous horrors. A chaotic and misguided attempt at family entertainment, the movie does offer a few good laughs, and the effects are frequently impressive, if not entirely convincing to the eye.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0800196767", "6303347657", "6302091632", "B00000JS61", "6300274268", "6305229449", "6304501153", "6302787068", "B00004RFHF", "B00006G8LB", "630596260X", "6303614493", "6302453356", "B000009CTR", "6303148352", "6302968143", "6303939015", "6304089627", "6304932553", "B00005LL26", "6303148387", "6305318867", "B0002OXUWO", "6304143184", "B00006953O", "0788810995", "B00004WIBZ", "6303446590", "B00000ICHA", "6302426200", "B000063V14", "6303828035", "0788812181", "6303338690", "0788809806", "B00005RRG5", "B00000JPH4", "6304211902", "157330574X", "6303925235", "6305310068", "6304434340", "6303206204"], "bought_together": ["0800196767", "6302091632"], "also_viewed": ["B000DBHX4M", "6304500831", "6305229449", "6302453356", "6302787068", "B000035Z2S", "6304089767", "6303314015", "080013558X", "0767836324", "B0000AQZYM", "6304290888", "0800196767", "B0000VCZKW", "0783229011", "0788805843", "B000VDDWDI", "B0007KTBIU", "B00004RFHF", "0788812408", "B000065V42", "6302158095", "B00005LOUP", "B00003CXXI", "080019683X", "B00000IVZN", "B00005JKDQ", "6302320402", "B00005LB83", "6303828035", "B00003CXQX", "6303394345", "B0001VL30O", "6305319138", "0788812807", "6302961572", "6303036813", "0788811002", "6302705517", "6302481805", "078881172X", "B000QQLVPQ", "155890641X", "B002GOAH10", "B00005JMQZ", "B00005JM4W", "0792151712", "B00000JYLP", "6303929338", "6303939015", "6303614493", "B00006CXK5", "6304434340", "6303118240", "0800125789", "B00016JF2W", "6304400551", "6300182207", "6303953425"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 284415}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6304030959", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51VDBVCMV0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Jumanji [VHS]"}

{"description": "John Frankenheimer's follow-up toThe Manchurian Candidateis as intimate and subdued as its predecessor is flamboyant and energetic. Burt Lancaster is calm and calculating as the steely-eyed military hawk General Scott, who opposes the president's (Fredric March) plan to end the cold war with a bold nuclear disarmament plan. Lancaster's longtime friend and frequent costar Kirk Douglas is his smiling, joking right-hand man, Colonel \"Jiggs\" Casey, whose easygoing manner is jolted by evidence of a possible plot to overthrow the American government. Scripted by Rod Serling from the novel by Fletcher Knebel and Charles W. Bailey, the film plays much like a classic live TV drama (the medium that spawned both Frankenheimer and Serling), with the drama arising from conversations and confrontations and the action largely limited to scenes within the Pentagon and the White House. An ominous undercurrent of danger seeps through the realistic (and often real) settings of the film, conveyed chiefly through the intensity of the excellent ensemble performances. Notable among the supporting cast are Ava Gardner as a lonely Washington socialite who was once the general's mistress, Edmond O'Brien as an amiable alcoholic senator, Martin Balsam as the president's shrewd but skeptical secretary, and underrated character actor George Macready as the wily presidential advisor.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00000408I", "B00005JMA5", "6304111398", "B00004XPPE", "B0001NBMH6", "B000055Y0X", "6300268047", "6303686745", "6300181405", "0792133153", "6302990076", "630396155X"], "bought_together": ["B00000408I"], "also_viewed": ["B00005JMA5"]}, "price": 29.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 333013}, "asin": "6304457391", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51B1EQE5ZKL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Seven Days in May [VHS]"}
{"description": "This science fiction blockbuster from 1990 began its production life as a very different movie than the one that was released. An adaptation of the Philip K. Dick short story &quot;We Can Remember It for You Wholesale,&quot;Total Recallwas originally conceived of with Richard Dreyfuss starring as a Walter Mitty-like character who experiences a variety of artificially induced fantasies. The movie we know is a mega-budget action epic set on Mars.

If you saw that (and you should), understand thatExpectationshas those ingredients (great sense of time, place, and timing) but adds modern music and sex appeal; the latter personified by the long-legged Gwyneth Paltrow.Finnegan Bell (Ethan Hawke as an adult, Jeremy James Kissner at age 10) is the new version of Dickens's Pip. He's a child wise beyond his years, befriending an escaped convict (Robert De Niro) in the warm waters of Florida's Gulf Coast. Finn is also the plaything for Estella (Paltrow as an adult, Raquel Beaudene at age 10), the niece of the coast's richest and most eccentric lady, Ms. Dinsmoor (a fun and flamboyant Anne Bancroft). The prudish Estella likes Finn (catch the best first kiss scene in many a moon) but has been brought up to disdain men; she'll break hearts. As the object of Finn's desires, Estella unfortunately is a one-dimensional character, yet what a dimension! Clad in Donna Karan dresses and her long, sun-kissed hair, Paltrow is luminous. She and Hawke make a very sexy couple.Mitch Glazer's script does better by Finn. He's a blue-collar worker with a gift for drawing (artwork by Francesco Clemente). Following his Uncle Joe's (Chris Cooper) honest ways, Finn grows up as a fisherman, thoughts of Estella and art drifting away in the hard work. When a mysterious benefactor allows him to follow his dream, Finn finds himself in New York, preparing for a once-in-a-lifetime art exhibit--and in the arms of the engaged Estella.Filled with cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki's golden-drenched light, the film has an irresistible, wildly romantic look. Dinsmoor's place is certainly gothic, Estella and Finn's longing encounters glamorous. Cuar&oacute;n uses anMTV-friendly soundtrackwith a confident touch. Songs by Tori Amos and the band Pulp--along withPatrick Doyle's silky score--create passionate scenes. It all ends far too swiftly with a seemingly tacked-on ending (reflecting the book, as it happens) but the film is splendid storytelling.

{"description": "The 1998 testosterone-saturated blow-'em-up from producer Jerry Bruckheimer and director Michael Bay (The Rock,Bad Boys) continues Hollywood's millennium-fueled fascination with the destruction of our planet. There's no arguing that the successful duo understands what mainstream American audiences want in their blockbuster movies--loads of loud, eye-popping special effects, rapid- fire pacing, and patriotic flag waving. Bay's protagonists--the eight crude, lewd, oversexed (but lovable, of course) oil drillers summoned to save the world from a Texas-sized meteor hurling toward the earth--are not flawless heroes, but common men with whom all can relate. In this huge Western-in-space soap opera, they're American cowboys turned astronauts. Sci-fi buffs will appreciate Bay's fetishizing of technology, even though it's apparent he doesn't understand it as anything more than flashing lights and shiny gadgets. Smartly, the duo also tries to lure the art-house crowd, raiding the local indie acting stable and populating the film with guys like Steve Buscemi, Billy Bob Thornton, Owen Wilson, and Michael Duncan, all adding needed touches of humor and charisma. When Bay applies his sledgehammer aesthetics to the action portions of the film, it's mindless fun; it's only whenArmageddontackles humanity that it becomes truly offensive. Not sinceMississippi Burninghave racial and cultural stereotypes been substituted for characters so blatantly--African Americans, Japanese, Chinese, Scottish, Samoans, Muslims, French ... if it's not white and American, Bay simplifies it. Or, make that whitemaleAmerica; the film features only three notable females--four if you count the meteor, who's constantly referred to as a \"bitch that needs drillin',\" but she's a hell of a lot more developed and unpredictable than the other women characters combined. Sure, Bay's film creates some tension and contains some visceral moments, but if he can't create any redeemable characters outside of those in space, what's the point of saving the planet?--Dave McCoy", "related": {"also_bought": ["6304681496", "6304233639", "0783222475", "0792845684", "B00003CXTF", "B00004WIDB", "B00000JGEN", "0792151712", "B000007OY0", "B0001DI5W6", "0783222955", "6302610702", "079213690X", "6302909023", "6300215830", "6301976622", "6301643410"], "bought_together": ["6304681496"], "also_viewed": ["6301398912", "630382790X", "6304233639", "6300214540", "6303257844", "B000003KHS", "0792151712", "B000059XYK", "0800125762", "B00005JM5E", "6302415853", "B00005PJ8I", "0783241542", "B00003CXTF"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 194393}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.38, "brand": "Touchstone Home Video", "asin": "6305169187", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515Y886RQYL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Armageddon [VHS]"}
{"description": "Officially produced to commemorate the 10-year anniversary of the Russian Revolution,Octoberquickly became another of Sergei Eisenstein's experiments in film form. As in his masterpiece,Battleship Potemkin, Eisenstein uses explosive montage to create the spirit of revolution--in this case, the events in St. Petersburg during the months leading up to the Bolshevik revolt. Eisenstein's insistence on speaking the language of pure film (deploying space, shadow, movement, and rhythm to create his meaning) shoves his mad rush of images straight into the viewer's eye. A worker's rebellion in the streets, followed by the raising of bridges to isolate their neighborhood, becomes a visual symphony of panic.

{"description": "Brian De Palma's 1998 thriller is largely an exercise in airing out his orchestral, oversized visual style (think of hisBlowout,Body Double, orRaising Cain) for the heck of it. The far-fetched story features Nicolas Cage as a crooked police detective attending a championship boxing match at which the Secretary of Defense is assassinated. The unfortunate Secretary's right-hand man (Gary Sinise) happens to be Cage's old friend, a fact that complicates the cop's efforts to reconstruct the crime from conflicting accounts--a directorial strategy bearing similarities to Kurosawa'sRashomon. The outrageousness of the scenario essentially gives De Palma permission to construct a baroque cathedral of spectacular camera stunts, which (he well knows) are inevitably more interesting than the hoary conspiracy plot. (The opening scene alone, which runs on for a number of minutes and consists of one, unbroken shot that moves in from the street, following Cage up and down stairs, and in and out of rooms until finally ending ringside at the match, is breathtaking.) The shifting points of view--based on the contradictory statements of witnesses--also give De Palma license to get creative with camera angles and scene rearrangements.

Norton appears to be living out every young actor's fantasy of re-creating Robert De Niro's prototypical head case in Martin Scorsese'sMean Streets, and while his performance is burdened by obvious quotation marks, his estimable talent still shines through. Damon's charm and intelligence bring some oomph to the curiously flat proceedings, and while his hushed, soul-bearing scenes with Martin Landau (as a law professor who takes a shine to the kid) seem gratuitous, they're still nice to watch.

{"description": "A pure old-school martial arts movie, beloved by aficionados, that also appeals to nonfans simply as a rousing action film. The often-imitated fact-based plot (seeThe Karate Kid) centers upon the rigorous training process undergone in the mid-19th century by the anti-Manchu Chinese patriot San Te (Gordon Liu). It's depicted as a grueling voyage into the unknown. Cast out of his home village when he stands up to the cruel warlord (Lo Lieh) who slaughtered his parents, the refugee seeks out the martial monks of the Shaolin Temple, who steer him through a torturous series of \"chambers\"--horrendous ordeals designed to build strength and agility--before he's even allowed to study boxing or swordfighting. Finally he defeats a rival by inventing a brand-new weapon, the three-section chain-linked staff. But innovation can be carried only so far; when San Te suggests opening a \"36th chamber\" in the temple that would teach Shaolin techniques to the populace at large (so that they can fight the nasty Manchus) he is drummed out of the corps. Naturally he returns to his home village, slaughters the baddies, and prepares to open China's first public Shaolin-style kung fu school. Many of the pupils San Te recruits in the final reel became legendary martial artists in their own right, the \"Fathers of the Church\" of the Chinese kung fu tradition. This is strong action entertainment with real historical resonance. --David Chute", "price": 24.98, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 582450}, "asin": "6305293619", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71VCRKAMHRL._SY300_.gif", "title": "Shaolin Master Killer [VHS]"}
{"description": "You might have heard people say they'd kill to get into Harvard. Well, here's a film that takes it literally.  There's a legendary rule at many universities, so the film posits, that if your roommate commits suicide you can take a 4.0&nbsp;GPA for the semester.  Tim (Matthew Lillard ofScreamfame, in yet another of his patented psycho roles) plans with his roommate Chris (Michael Vartan) to kill a third roommate Rand (Randall Batinkoff) so they can collect their 4.0s and get Chris a Harvard M.B.A.  As Chris says, \"Either it's a Harvard M.B.A. or you're flipping burgers.\"  No elevated thinker, Chris.  Rand is a cruel jerk to his Sandy Dennis-like girlfriend, Natalie (Tamara Craig Thomas), so it's hard to miss him when he's gone.  But that sentiment applies equally to nearly every other character in the picture, including Chris's girlfriend Emma (Keri Russell), who seems to be the most sympathetic of the group.  That's the movie's strength; you think you know everyone but you don't.  And that's also its greatest weakness; you need to know and like these people for the film to work.  If you can stomach these people (in which case counseling might be in order), the exceedingly twisty-turny plot  will keep you entertained to the last amazing revelation.  Otherwise, you might want to keep searching for a thriller that gives its people an inner life worth viewing.The Curvewas snatched from Sundance for a distribution deal by Trimark, but wound up in this direct-to-video release instead.--Jim Gay", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792840127", "0767824954", "0767837398", "B000F5WR4W", "B007XF0W3K", "B00003CXUP", "B004P7CN7W", "B00344EAN2", "B00005O5AX", "B00005JKJJ", "B000KHYN9C", "B002GHHHL0", "B00AEBB8QK", "B00BNWWVFG", "B002CVQAX6", "B0053TWVQE", "B000NJMJHK", "0783226845", "B00DNF1R74", "B000A0GP0Y", "B00A47BT7C", "B00BNWWUDY", "B00BDZV8ZM", "B00004YA67", "B000MV8ABS", "B009AMAJPA", "B000FFJZO2", "B00441GYVA", "0790736411", "B002LMSWN2", "B00013RC7K", "B0002WT4OE", "B000PAAJVU", "B004SUDQ1I", "6305065551", "B001URA5Y8", "B00005KAQP", "B00003CXKM", "B000WMFZK6", "B00BCMT2BI", "0792846443", "B000ASATZ8", "B00005UQ9W", "B000053VB2", "B00979KQD6", "B000CPH9PM", "6304711891", "B00006ZXSL", "B002ZG983M", "1573625779", "B0006N2EZ0", "B00AEFXT1S", "B00003CXPS", "B004HZY8OS", "B00004ZESE"], "bought_together": ["0767824954", "B004P7CN7W"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B009POCG2C", "0767824954"]}, "price": 5.96, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 71766}, "asin": "6305375577", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51SW1SWSGEL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Curve"}

{"description": "Wes Anderson's follow-up to the quirkyBottle Rocketis a wonderfully unorthodox coming-of-age story that ranks withHarold and MaudeandThe Graduatein the pantheon of timeless cult classics. Jason Schwartzman (son of Talia Shire and nephew of Francis Coppola) stars as Max Fischer, a 15-year-old attending the prestigious Rushmore Academy on scholarship, where he's failing all of his classes but is the superstar of the school's extracurricular activities (head of the drama club, the beekeeper club, the fencing club...). Possessing boundless confidence and chutzpah, as well as an aura of authority he seems to have been born with, Max finds two unlikely soulmates in his permutations at Rushmore: industrial magnate and Rushmore alumnus Herman Blume (Bill Murray) and first-grade teacher Rosemary Cross (Olivia Williams). His alliance with Blume and crush on Miss Cross, however, are thrown out of kilter by his expulsion from Rushmore, and a budding romance between the two adults that threatens Max's own designs on the lovely schoolteacher.Never stooping to sentimentality or schmaltz, Anderson and cowriter Owen Wilson have fashioned a wickedly intelligent and wildly funny tale of young adulthood that hits all the right notes in its mix of melancholy and optimism. As played by Schwartzman, Max is both immediately endearing and ferociously irritating: smarter than all the adults around him, with little sense of his shortcomings, he's an unstoppable dynamo who commands grudging respect despite his outlandish projects (including a school play about Vietnam). Murray, as the tycoon who determinedly wages war with Max for the affections of Miss Cross, is a revelation of middle-aged resignation. Disgusted with his family, his life, and himself, he's turned around by both Max's antagonism and Miss Cross's love. Williams is equally affecting as the teacher who still carries a torch for her dead husband, and the superb supporting cast also includes Seymour Cassel as Max's barber father, Brian Cox as the frustrated headmaster of Rushmore, and a hilarious Mason Gamble as Max's young charge. Put this one on your shelf of modern masterpieces.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["0767821408", "B0000640VJ", "B0007UC8Y4", "B0010X8NF0", "B007L6VR12", "B001QOGYBI", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B000CS464G", "B007L6VR6M", "081099741X", "B0006TPE4C", "B00005JMJ4", "B0035G5IOE", "B00005JLRE", "B00005JMJG", "B00JAQJNN0", "B00007AJF8", "B00003CWTI", "B00H9HZITU", "B00441GZ1E", "B00000G02H", "B0083V2W4U", "B000A7DVR2", "B005C7SXMS", "B0006H32EI", "B000K0YLZ0", "B002O3Z4Z2", "1623160510", "B000934FC2", "B001CW7ZT4", "B00GMV8L1Q", "B001AQO400", "B001P3SA8K", "0783228457", "B00AEFXQ9S", "0571200125", "B00000ING2", "6304907729", "B00003CXGA", "B0000VD04M", "B001EOQCL2", "B003UESJHO", "B000LP6KNU", "B000Y7U98C", "B001UV4XUG", "0792846109", "B0045HCIZY", "B002VWNIAY", "B00AEFXUXU", "B007D5E7C2", "B007N5YJMA", "B003KGBIS4", "B0045NXMJE", "B00008RH3J", "B00AEFYVUQ", "B006TTC5MM", "B001MM3AZM", "B004XVMCN0", "1558908382", "B00IGK6TLA", "B0041T52S6", "B00029RTAI", "0783229526", "B00IJXJAIS", "B00004RJ73", "B003CRM6PA", "B004U7MR14", "B00005ALS0", "B004FQX5B6", "B00005QAPH", "B003ELKNH2", "B000025RE7", "B00005JNC2", "B006TTC5A4", "B00006CXGZ", "6305327068", "B00005Q4CS", "B004SEUIXS", "0792838068", "B002LMV7RA", "B00003CWOL", "B007D0FVRM", "B00A81MV3U", "B00005ATQB", "B00005V9HH", "B000IU37SO", "0783225903", "B00006LPGP", "B000M341QY", "B004SIP8ES", "B000Z8GZYW", "B00005JLSK", "B000063JDE", "B0014D5RBE", "B0018BD9DA", "B00005JPAR", "B00AFEY354", "B00079Z9VO", "B002DU39GW", "B00005O06J"], "bought_together": ["B0007UC8Y4", "B0000640VJ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00JAQJMJ0", "B0007UC8Y4", "B007L6VR12", "B0010X8NF0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 2630}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 13.11, "brand": "DISNEY", "asin": "6305428239", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51149RFCCPL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Rushmore"}

{"description": "It's, like, Shakespeare, man! This good-natured and likeable update ofThe Taming of the Shrewtakes the basics of Shakespeare's farce about a surly wench and the man who tries to win her and transfers it to modern-day Padua High School. Kat Stratford (Julia Stiles) is a sullen, forbidding riot grrrl who has a blistering word for everyone; her sunny younger sister Bianca (Larisa Oleynik) is poised for high school stardom. The problem: overprotective and paranoid Papa Stratford (a dryly funny Larry Miller) won't let Bianca date until boy-hating Kat does, which is to say never. When Bianca's pining suitor Cameron (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) gets wind of this, he hires the mysterious, brooding Patrick Verona (Heath Ledger) to loosen Kat up. Of course, what starts out as a paying gig turns to true love as Patrick discovers that underneath her brittle exterior, Kat is a regular babe. The script, by Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith, is sitcom-funny with peppy one-liners and lots of smart teenspeak; however, its cleverness and imagination doesn't really extend beyond its characters' Renaissance names and occasional snippets of real Shakespearean dialogue. What makes the movie energetic and winning is the formula that helped makeShe's All Thatsuch a big hit: two high-wattage stars who look great and can really act. Ledger is a hunk of promise with a quick grin and charming Aussie accent, and Stiles mines Kat's bitterness and anger to depths usually unknown in teen films; her recitation of her English class sonnet (from which the film takes its title) is funny, heartbreaking, and hopelessly romantic. The imperious Allison Janney (Primary Colors) nearly steals the film as a no-nonsense guidance counselor secretly writing a trashy romance novel.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303853102", "6302998611", "6302787068", "6301796535", "B00006RCST", "630018403X", "6300183467", "6302091632", "0800109481", "6300214753", "6302968100", "6300263673", "6304978286"], "also_viewed": ["B005HY1P94"]}, "price": 10.53, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 177740}, "asin": "6305537798", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/712HBPMSPEL._SY300_.gif", "title": "10 Things I Hate About You [VHS]"}

Or what exactly fascinated student filmmaker Heather and what possibly took her, Mike, and Josh from this earth? Get all your background questions answered byCurse of the Blair Witch, a one-stop-shopping \"documentary\" originally produced for the Sci-Fi Channel as a tie-in marketing tool. Entirely fictionalized,Curse of the Blair Witchfocuses both on the past and the present, with copious info on the Blair Witch myth as well as on the disappearance of Heather, Josh, and Mike. As it turns out, the original witch was one Elly Kedward, who was accused in 1785 of taking blood from several children; she was subsequently banished to the harsh winter woods and left for dead. Her grisly and bloody legacy involves missing children, polluted water, disemboweled men, and a serial killer of children who claims to have been haunted by \"an old woman ghost.\" Aside from some ineffective \"newsreel\" footage of the serial killer, all this intriguing information is presented convincingly and chillingly.Cursemay in fact freak you out more than the movie, and it evokes the great, pulpyIn Search Ofseries of the '70s, one of the prime inspirations for filmmakers Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez. News clips of the search for Heather, Josh, and Mike lend a v&eacute;rit&eacute; atmosphere to the proceedings, but shed little light on their mysterious disappearance or their characters. Basically, it's a tease to go see the movie.

{"description": "It looks like writer-director Rick Famuyiwa started a popular trend with his marriage-jitters comedy about three friends who reminisce about their lives together as one prepares to leave the group when he gets married. Everyone who rushed to seeThe Best Manshould catch this sleeper which also stars Taye Diggs (as Roland, the reluctant groom), as well as Omar Epps and Richard T. Jones, who together provide charming, cheerful performances full of warmth and humor. This buddy story is told through flashbacks to 1986, when the three met at public school. The young men gain our affection in their competition to win the most girls, which enhances the bond of loyalty we see in them as men on the eve of Roland's wedding. The casting of the boy actors is almost spooky in its perfection, especially Sean Nelson (who had already proven his acting acumen inAmerican Buffalo) as the younger version of Epps. Although the cast is African American, there's no color bar to the themes or entertainment the movie offers, providing a salient lesson to network TV producers under attack by the NAACP for their inability to include characters of color in TV shows.

{"description": "\"I have a bad feeling about this,\" says the young Obi-Wan Kenobi  (played by Ewan McGregor) inStar Wars: Episode I, The Phantom  Menaceas he steps off a spaceship and into the most anticipated cinematic event... well, ever. He might as well be speaking for the  legions of fans of the original episodes in theStar Warssaga  who can't help but secretly ask themselves: Sure, this isStar  Wars, but is itmy Star Wars? The original elevated  moviegoers' expectations so high that it would have been impossible for  any subsequent film to meet them. And as with all theStar Warsmovies,The Phantom Menacefeatures inexplicable plot twists, a  fistful of loose threads, and some cheek-chewing dialogue. Han Solo's  swagger is sorely missed, as is the pervading menace of heavy-breathing  Darth Vader. There is still way too much quasi-mystical mumbo jumbo,  and some of what was fresh aboutStar Wars22 years earlier  feels formulaic. Yet there's much to admire. The special effects are  stupendous; three worlds are populated with a m&eacute;lange of creatures, flora, and horizons rendered in absolute  detail. The action and battle scenes are breathtaking in their  complexity. And one particular sequence of the film--the  adrenaline-infused pod race through the Tatooine desert--makes the chariot race inBen-Hurlook like a Sunday stroll through the park.Among the host of new characters, there are a few familiar walk-ons. We  witness the first meeting between R2-D2 and C-3PO, Jabba the Hutt looks  younger and slimmer (but not young and slim), and Yoda is as crabby as  ever. Natalie Portman's stately Queen Amidala sports hairdos that make  Princess Leia look dowdy and wields a mean laser. We never bond with  Jedi Knight Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson), and Obi-Wan's day is yet to come.

{"description": "Lucio \"King of the Eyeball Gag\" Fulci made his name  with a series of gory, gooey horror epics, andThe Beyondstands above  all as his outr&eacute; masterpiece. The largely incoherent plot has something to do  with a turn-of-the-century curse and a doorway to hell in the cellar of an old New Orleans hotel. Fulci shows his usual sensitivity with wooden acting, clumsy  dialogue, and buckets of oozing blood and pus, but don't let that get in  the way of enjoying this mad tale of zombies from hell  invading Earth and eating their way through a cast of humans: crucified martyrs, blind  visionaries, creepy hotel handymen, befuddled cops, and a plucky pair of  heroes desperately fleeing a horde of hungry undead. The blood-red art  direction is eerily beautiful, and Fulci's relentless long takes, punctuated by jolting shock cuts and eruptions of grotesque violence, create a mood  of sheer paranoid horror right down to the final, mind-bending image. And  don't forget the Fulci claim to fame: eyes are gouged out, eaten away,  melted with acid, and (shudder) popped out by a spike through the back of  the skull. Yech! If you dare ignore such piddling details as narrative  logic and let yourself get carried away on the creepy visuals, it's a  deliciously stylish treat, an edgy bit of gothic gore pitched in all its  bone-crunching, flesh-ripping, organ-splatting glory. This sadistic,  sanguinary hell-spawn tale is for gore-hounds only.The DVD features chatty but largely jokey commentary by David Warbeck and  Catriona MacColl and an alternate German credits sequence featuring Fulci's preferred sepia-tinged prologue (but no alternate footage).--Sean  Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0036R92US", "B0057O6IMS", "B0002C9DK4", "B004FUPK6U", "B000S0GYRU", "B004KDYR20", "B001D5C1R6", "B000S0GYRK", "B002E01MHY", "B000KRNG54", "B0036R92UI", "B0057O6IDW", "B000T28POC", "B00LMBUR6S", "B001OBBS4Q", "B000HXDWNM", "B000096I9V", "B000MV8ZCW", "B000JU7JIW", "B00000IBRJ", "B000TZJCMS", "B00009WNXA", "B0007WQHI0", "B003NEQ74S", "B008DRKJ76", "B000HXDWRS", "B001AR0D6I", "B000YKI4U4", "B002E01MI8", "B00ARWX9NG", "B000S0GYRA", "B004WMOSKA", "B004FUPK3I", "B001B187L6", "B00LMBURDG", "B00000JT2R", "B003L1YESE", "B0002VYOVS", "B005ZHBEPI", "B000063K1F", "B0026LYMJ6", "B00004Z1GI", "0783228457", "B00005NG08", "B00LBFFR2Y", "B000RPCK2O", "B000TZJCNC", "B000AC7P5Q", "B00005KH30", "B008BWFOXM", "B000TZJCN2", "B00BCMSY80", "B000S0GYS4", "B005OT7ZWI", "B002GPVDMG", "B000IMUYJM", "B0009OUBC4", "B00005U12U", "B00KDU8HQQ", "B005CVFZ66", "B000GIXCL0", "B008CYDD7I", "157362408X", "B008I34YOE", "B003THSXJ6", "B000V6LT5S", "B0001611DI", "B000MV8ABS", "B0002C9DJU", "B00JJOY47I", "B000BB1926", "B00JV054A6", "B000IJ7A5Q", "B00B49GSQQ", "B001MEJY8W", "B000TZJCNW", "B000F3UA8E", "B00125WATQ", "B00FGAKEU0", "B0000694YT", "B003V924Y2", "B000RPCJA2", "B000E41MTU", "B000E8M0P6", "B00023P4SS", "B000V6LT6C", "B00009PY2T", "B0072GPQ8G", "1598830392", "B000067J0M", "B004KDYR1G", "B00GHH9IIA", "B00E5S2HGS", "B00BCMT2BI", "B001LIK8DO", "B00IA1VKVY", "B000T28POM", "B0001XAKUQ", "B0002DB5PO", "B003JFCG82"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0002C9DK4", "B0036R92US", "B0057O6IMS", "B004KDYR20"]}, "price": 19.08, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 91834}, "asin": "6305972052", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51YAWQZAA4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Beyond"}

Extrapolated from Bruno Barreto'sDona Flor and Her Two Husbands, the film stars Sally Field as a woman about to embark on her second marriage after her first husband, a charismatic Broadway director and choreographer (James Caan), has died. But as she plans her wedding to the likable but unexciting Jeff Bridges, Caan returns from the dead. Though only she can see him, it's a formula for disaster: She begins to doubt her plans and wonders whether she'd be happier with Caan's ghost than with Bridges's live body. Meanwhile, everyone else begins to doubt her sanity because she's talking to a dead man.

{"description": "There's no rule against rock anthems from the 1970s in the soundtrack for a movie about a medieval jousting champion, but if you're going to attempt such jarring anachronisms, you'd better establish acceptable ground rules. Writer-director Brian Helgeland does precisely that inA Knight's Taleand pulls off this trick with such giddy aplomb that you can't help but play along. (Upon witnessing a crowd of peasants at a jousting match, singing and clapping to the beat of Queen's \"We Will Rock You,\" you're either going to love this movie or dismiss it altogether.) Other vintage rock hits will follow, but Helgeland--the Oscar&#xAE;-winning cowriter ofL.A. Confidential--handles this ploy with judicious goodwill, in what is an otherwise honest period piece about a peasant named William (Heath Ledger) who rises by grit and determination to the hallowed status of knighthood.As if the soundtrack weren't audacious enough, Helgeland (recovering from the sour experience of his directorial debut,Payback) casts none other than Geoffrey Chaucer (wonderfully played by Paul Bettany) as William's cohort and match announcer, along with William's pals Roland (Mark Addy) and Wat (Alan Tudyk), and feisty blacksmith Kate (Laura Fraser). Of course there must be a fair maiden, and she is Jocelyn (newcomer Shannyn Sossamon), with whom William falls in love while battling the nefarious Count Adhemar (Rufus Sewell) on the European jousting circuit. Add to this an inspiring father-son reunion, Ledger's undeniable charisma, a perfect supporting cast, and enough joyful energy to rejuvenate the film's formulaic plot, andA Knight's Talebecomes that most pleasant of movie surprises--an unlikely winner that rises up, like its hero, to exceed all expectations.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000EDWKXI", "0800141601", "B00447L4KA", "B00006ZXSK", "B004SEUIWY", "B002VWNID6", "B00004XPPG", "B00003CXC3", "B00005EBIL", "B000ARXF96", "B00AEFXKUI", "B004SUDQ40", "B001HN69AY", "B004SIP9U6", "0792839137", "B0002YLCG0", "B003UYUQZW", "B003FCKIGQ", "B000056VP4", "B002NZK5V4", "B00005JLO2", "B002O3Z50Q", "B002O3Z4XY", "B00AEFY5B6", "B000GGSMO4", "6305428077", "B00003CXG7", "B00004WG2F", "B00005JN0T", "B0010V4VJY", "B005ORVN00", "B00000JQB5", "6305428042", "6305123454", "0783225814", "B00AEBB9UU", "6305692688", "B0000WN0SW", "B000MGUZCU", "B00006ADFM", "B00005JKCH", "B00AMEZDJW", "B0000TPA0G", "B0000844I8", "B002GHHHHO", "0783240295", "B000K7VHQ4", "B00000K3UU", "B00005JKMN", "B000EPFCPE", "B0006GAI5U", "B0007IO6NM", "B002K0WBXW", "0767821513", "B00005QJJG", "B00008EYA5", "B00004Z4WR", "B00005JKNV", "B00005LOL0", "B004SIP6BI", "B00003CXHJ", "B002NXSRVG", "B002ZG999U", "B004SEUJ9Q", "0783233477", "B000T5O47Q", "B00F84H73Q", "B003U0AHBO", "B00004W4UD", "B00AEFXYOA", "B000AARKOO", "B00AEFZ6V4", "B00005JM5B", "B0001HLVS2", "6305428387", "B002GHHHME", "B000LC55F2", "B00AEBB8R4", "B007SPPANM", "B001GZ6QC4", "B00BLN4V46", "B000EGDB10", "0800195175", "B000FKO5QK", "B000U7WV1Y", "B00BTYSIWI", "B0038N9X3Q", "6305609764", "B000K4WPCC", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B00011CZRE", "B00005JMOW", "0800141741", "B00005JPD0", "B001DDBD4K", "B00008G7UF", "B000209KMW", "1558908382", "B004LWZWGA", "B0009RCPUW"], "bought_together": ["B00447L4KA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0800141601", "B00447L4KA", "B00003CXC3"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 7604}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.99, "brand": "Columbia Telecommunications", "asin": "B00000F4ZY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51rNtZ4oMwL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "A Knight's Tale (Special Edition)"}

There are also two unremarkable alternate scenes plus a mock commercial for Philip Seymour Hoffman's Mattress Man character that will make you wince and probably laugh.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00003CWTI", "B000PAAJZ6", "B008220DGE", "B002QFYJF4", "B00AEBB9CS", "1573625574", "B001P3SA8K", "B000QFCCR8", "B008220DIC", "B00000K3D3", "B00005JLRE", "0783227345", "B00008WI9N", "B002LVVCJY", "B00332F3MW", "B00005BCK9", "B002PLPQLU", "B00112S8RS", "B0014GI6I2", "B00005JMJG", "B00000IC7G", "B00007AJF8", "B0000BXMZ8", "B00AEBBAEU", "B00008K7AO", "B00005NGAY", "B000E33VWW", "B00008RH3J", "B00005JKJA", "B0013XZ2QK", "B001P3SA8A", "B00006CXGZ", "B00005JMJ4", "B0007UC8Y4", "6305428239", "6305803765", "B004SIP71M", "B0000640VJ", "B0007OCG56", "B003102JDM", "B0006GW2JU", "B0060ZJ7DA", "0767821408", "B0006TPE4C", "B000CS464G", "B00003CXPS", "0767830555", "B00AQBDU4Q", "B00008RH3L", "6305781095", "B0000C8ROV", "B00979KQ4U", "B00006RCNV", "B000FVQM2Y", "B0010X8NF0", "B000063JDE", "B00H9HZITU", "B00320J6WS", "B00005JM4Q", "B002ZG97T2", "B00BTYMPX6", "B00005JMW7", "B0009W5IMO", "B00GMV8KGW", "B000N6TX1I", "B002E2M5IC", "B00112S8S2", "B00AEBB8SS", "B000BX8R10", "B004SIP73U", "B001FB55MG", "B00AQTY3JO", "B00AEBB89W", "B00H9HZGQ0", "B001B1UO7G", "B0011NVC8Y", "B005KKVAHW", "B00AEFXE9U", "B000092T3X", "B00AEFXE3Q", "B004SIP8ZM", "B0006GAOJA", "B00AEFXESQ", "B0035G5IOE", "1557044066", "B000286RP2", "B00386OWUC", "B00GMV8L1Q", "B000QFCCRI", "B00005NC66", "B000ELJAEM", "B000CSUNQQ", "B00003CXGA", "B00005AUJK", "B00005JPAR", "B00005QAPH", "B00000ING2", "B0024FADCE", "B00AEFXN9G", "B000VXWX7E"], "bought_together": ["B00003CWTI", "B000PAAJZ6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B008220DGE", "B000PAAJYW", "B000PAAJZ6", "B001P3SA8K"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 37835}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.15, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B00000G02H", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZDG4AGVPL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Punch-Drunk Love (Two-Disc Special Edition)"}
{"description": "EDITOR'S NOTE: According to a Warner Home Video technician involved in  the production ofThe Stanley Kubrick Collection, Kubrick authorized all aspects of theCollection, from the use of Digital Component Video (or \"D-1\") masters originally approved in 1989, to the use of minimalist screen menus, chapter stops, and (in the case of2001: A Space OdysseyandThe Shiningon DVD) supplementary materials. Full-screen presentation ofThe ShiningandFull Metal Jacketwas also approved by Kubrick, who recomposed his original framing,  reportedly believing that those films looked best on video in the full-screen format. (In fact, the original theatrical aspect ratio ofThe Shiningwas 1.66:1, meaning that a relatively small portion of the image is lost.) Kubrick also chose mono over stereo,  believing that inconsistencies in theatrical sound systems resulted in loss of control over theatrical presentation. In every respect, the Warner spokesman  said, the films in theCollectionremain as Kubrick approved them. Any future attempt to remaster or alter them would  have to be approved by an appointee of the Kubrick estate.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00366F2NU", "B000UJ48SQ", "0792841409", "B005152C9G", "B000055Y0X", "B0013D8LKO", "0783226039", "B004L9GMBC", "B00005ATQB", "0792841387", "B007K8ILTW", "B000P0J09C", "B0000AUHQ6", "B000063JDE", "B002VWNIDG", "B001IHJ988", "B000EBD9TE", "B000EBD9SU", "B000UJCAKY", "B001FOK70S", "0679727299", "B00005JKJA", "B00004TWZH", "B00006RCNV", "B001LXIDUY", "0679723161", "6305999872", "B0087ZG7OI", "B00DW5IKYS", "B008RO875Q", "B0045HCJ94", "B0013FSXT6", "B00005JKGX", "B00AEBB89C", "B0087ZG7UW", "0767830555", "B0020LH8WU", "B0050FXDDQ", "B0057UA486", "B0045HCJ8U", "B000UJCAKO", "B0009S4J3M", "B0041KKYEM", "B001152TL6", "B00009W5CA", "B00C3ALLDA", "B00AEFXN9G", "B001FZQOW2", "B00000IREA", "B0000DJZ8Q", "B00005U2KC", "B0087ZG7R0", "B0010AN7Z4", "B007Y1NR1W", "B005Z9MGRG", "B00005QAPH", "B008BFSMBA", "B004NWPY20", "B00003CXBU", "B00AEFXESQ", "B007Y1NNAW", "B00079Z9VO", "B00K8HAIAW", "B003ELKNH2", "B0082CWTSY", "B001TIQT70", "B00062IVM6", "B005KQVE1S", "0783230559", "B0000549B1", "B000CNESU8", "B00004XPPK", "B00008RH3J", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B000QQFKYE", "B000EXDSCA", "B00AEFYSEA", "B00009MEKJ", "B000VLCRCW", "B002VWNICC", "B003VA3JTK", "B0045HCJ9O", "B00003CXCF", "078323502X", "B0010YVCI4", "B00BTYU3SK", "B00006ADD5", "B002LYD2MG", "B006TTC5HC", "B0009A40ES", "B00026L8US", "B008MIMWP8", "B0000DI87S", "B003O7I6SE", "B009POCG0Y", "B00000CQJZ", "B000G8NXYG", "B001PYD0LG", "6304907729"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00366F2NU", "B000UJ48SQ", "B0013D8LKO", "B000UJ48T0"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 158378}, "asin": "B00000J2KV", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/714ZK0VSVBL._SY300_.gif", "title": "Lolita"}

The film won the Grand Prize at the Cannes Film Festival and critical acclaim but was rarely seen for many years.

{"description": "After viewingSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Edgar Rice Burroughs wrote to Walt Disney about adapting his novel of an ape-man into a feature animated cartoon. Sixtysome years later, the tale is finally told with brilliant design work that looks unlike any previous animated film. The story is a natural for Disney since the themes of misunderstood central figures have been at the heart of its recent hits. Disney'sTarzandoesn't wander far from the familiar story of a shipwrecked baby who is brought up by apes in Africa. What gives the film its zing is its clever use of music (the songs are sung by Phil Collins himself rather than onscreen characters) and the remarkable animation. Deep Canvas, a 3-D technology, was developed for the film, creating a jungle that comes alive as Tarzan swings through the trees, often looking like a modern skateboarder racing down giant tree limbs. The usual foray of sidekicks, including a rambunctious ape voiced by Rosie O'Donnell, should keep the little ones aptly entertained. The two lead voices, Tony Goldwyn as Tarzan and Minnie Driver as Jane, are inspired choices. Their chemistry helps the story through the weakest points (the last third) and makes Tarzan's initial connection with all things human (including Jane) delicious entertainment. Disney still is not taking risks in its animated films, but as cookie-cutter entertainment,Tarzanmakes a pretty good treat.

{"description": "As the triumphant start of a trilogy,The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ringleaves you begging for more. By necessity, Peter  Jackson's ambitious epic compresses J.R.R. Tolkien's classicThe Lord of the Rings,  but this robust adaptation maintains reverent allegiance to Tolkien's creation,  instantly qualifying as one of the greatest fantasy films ever made. At 178  minutes, it's long enough to establish the myriad inhabitants of Middle-earth,  the legendary Rings of Power, and the fellowship of hobbits, elves, dwarves, and  humans--led by the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and the brave hobbit Frodo  (Elijah Wood)--who must battle terrifying forces of evil on their perilous  journey to destroy the One Ring in the land of Mordor. Superbly paced, the film  is both epic and intimate, offering astonishing special effects and production  design while emphasizing the emotional intensity of Frodo's adventure. Ending on  a perfect note of heroic loyalty and rich anticipation, this wondrous fantasy  continues inThe Two Towers(2002).--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JKZV", "B00005JKZY", "B00BEZTMFY", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B005COPWZW", "B00005JM5E", "B002ZG980U", "B002PMV9FG", "B001GZ6QC4", "B007K3JFUQ", "B000U7WV1Y", "B00005JNJV", "B001OQCV6A", "B004M1A21K", "B008UZ7MYY", "B00HFFE8HE", "B000A9QKLO", "B000E8M0VA", "B000W7F5SS", "B0014C2FX8", "0618640150", "B001DHXT20", "B00E5I2M6I", "B00003CX5P", "B0013FDM7E", "B00AZMFJYA", "B00005QZWI", "B0019L770A", "B000I0RQVI", "B002IPFWTE", "B001CDR1FG", "B0006UEVT0", "B003TT2X6S", "B001OQCV2E", "B009JBWOU0", "B00005JL78", "B00005JNOG", "B001UV4XHY", "B00CNW9ZI6", "B00GKOJ98E", "0345325818", "B0014Z4ON4", "B000H30B2C", "B005LXQLRW", "B001UV4XIS", "B001GCUO1Q", "B00CZDLGDU", "0345538374", "B004LWZW42", "B007REV4T8", "B000W746GK", "B00005JPH2", "B003TT2X72", "B004LWZWGA", "B0087ZG7J8", "B005G4TJUC", "B003ZK99NQ", "B00006HBUJ", "B008UZA8FY", "B0090SI56Y", "B000VI70QS", "B00005JNC2", "B004WCTLNY", "B0014Z4OMU", "6305313687", "B004AKCME8", "B000E6EK2Y", "0547928211", "B000LC55F2", "B0002KVUKM", "B000FQJAIW", "B008JFUO72", "B000FIMG68", "B005LAIHSG", "B005LAIIT4", "B004AOECXI", "B00029RTCG", "B000P0J0EM", "B002HWRYJE", "B0060FXDCG", "B001ECQ75A", "0792839749", "B00AEFXZJE", "B005LAII0I", "B0042U94UQ", "B001HN6918", "B00008G8M5", "B008JFURII", "B003ZKBELG", "B000P0J09W", "B003XURDAY", "B00335EQ0E", "B00008G8M4", "0547928203", "B000W796OM", "B00006ADD5", "B00J49R1BY", "B00B04NIZO", "B00G5G7EXY", "B00001ZWUS"], "bought_together": ["B00005JKZV", "B00005JKZY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00HFFE8HE", "B00005JKZY", "B00BEZTMFY", "B00005JKZV"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 3641}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.49, "brand": "NEW Line Home Video", "asin": "B00003CWT6", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Dj%2BQ1hLBL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)"}
{"description": "A confident hybrid ofM*A*S*H,Treasure of the Sierra Madre, andDr. Strangelove,Three Kingsis one of the most seriously funny war movies ever made. Improving the premise ofKelly's Heroeswith scathing intelligence, it explores the odd connection between war and consumerism in the age of Humvees and cellular phones. Writer-director David O.&nbsp;Russell's third film (afterSpanking the MonkeyandFlirting with Disaster), it's a no-holds-barred portrait of personal conscience in the volatile arena of politics, played out by one of the most gifted filmmakers to emerge in the 1990s.George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg, Ice Cube, and Spike Jonze (director ofBeing John Malkovich) play a quartet of U.S.&nbsp;soldiers who, disillusioned by Operation Desert Storm, decide to steal $23&nbsp;million in gold hijacked from Kuwait by Saddam Hussein's army. Getting the bullion out of an Iraqi stronghold is easy; keeping it is a potentially lethal proposition. By the end of their mercenary mission, the Americans can no longer ignore wartime atrocities (and neither can we--the film is boldly unflinching), and conscience demands their aid to Kuwaiti rebels abandoned by President George Bush's fickle wartime policy. This is serious stuff indeed, but Russell infusesThree Kingswith a keen sense of the absurd, and the entire film is an exercise in breathtaking visual ingenuity. Despite a conventional ending that's mildly disappointing for such a brashly original film,Three Kingsconveys the brutal madness of war while making you laugh out loud at the insanity.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B00DON8NJ0", "B000IYV1ME", "B000O7667K", "B000H1RFKU", "B003ASLJOK", "B000JU7KAE", "B001G8XOMG", "B00DON4TPC", "B001O7JHSO", "B0046BHC6O", "B0021L8URQ", "B001XURJCS", "B001CT877G", "B0013FSXT6", "B002ZG97QU", "B0047BXR1W", "B001HN69CC", "B000JLPMPI", "B000HLDFK4", "B000TGGJKU", "B003L7DK60", "B001AQT0RC", "B001J6NZGU", "B0011VIODW", "B000Q7ZND6", "B000P6XU60", "B000H1RFKK", "B001FB55M6", "B0017TYPIG", "B000O176IO", "B0011E5D2Y", "B000KF0NI4", "B000Q6GX90", "B000LPS4BG", "B000M5AJQI", "B000JUB7LW", "B0015GDVTU", "B000UJ48UO", "B002Z7FM68", "B000I5XOWI", "B000MEYFXW", "B0012YYZYK", "B000PC0U1W", "B003YOZNBK", "B001NCDCQ8", "B000JLSLZQ", "B000R3PDK2", "B001FB55H6", "B0010HOZXA", "B003B1X80Y", "B000JLSM00", "B001O7JHW0", "B006H3MIYA", "B000MQ54OY", "B003UESJHY", "B000Q66J1M", "B006OQ0K0E", "B003TT2X6S", "B001OQCUZW", "B003TT2X6I"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B006H3MIYA", "B002T9H2L0", "B003KGBIS4", "B00HF98SY4"]}, "price": 8.5, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 1098395}, "asin": "B00003CX73", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51BA5ATJSYL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Three Kings"}

{"description": "To callPearl Harbora throwback to old-time war movies is something of an understatement. Director Michael Bay's epic take on the bombing that brought the United States into World War II hijacks every war movie situation and clich&#xE9; (some affectionate, some stale) you've ever seen and gives them a shiny, glossy spin until the whole movie practically gleams. Planes glisten, water sparkles, trees beckon--and Bay's re-creation of the bombing itself, a 30-minute sequence that's tightly choreographed and amazingly photographed, sets the action movie bar up quite a few notches. And in updating the classic war film, Bay and screenwriter Randall Wallace (Braveheart) use that old plot standby, the love triangle--this time, it's between two pilots (Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett) and a nurse (Kate Beckinsale) who find themselves stationed at Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, during what they thought would be a nice, sunny tour of duty. Then, of course, history intervened.For the first 90 minutes of the movie, Affleck and Beckinsale find a nice, appealing chemistry that plays on his strengths as a movie star and hers as a serious actress--he gives her glamour, she gives him smarts. Their truncated romance--the beginning of which is told in flashback so we can get right to the point where he has to leave her to go to England--works, thanks to their charm. They're no Kate and Leo fromTitanic(a strategy the film strives hard toward), but they're pretty darn adorable in their own right. Hartnett, as the not entirely unwelcome third wheel, squints bravely but makes only a slight dent in the film. Everyone else inPearl Harbor--from Cuba Gooding Jr.'s brave navy seaman to Jon Voight's able impersonation of FDR--is pretty much a glorified walk-on, taking a backseat to the pyrotechnics and action sequences that keep the three-hour film in fairly constant motion. But when that action does take hold,Pearl Harboris quite a thrilling ride.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792151712", "B000059HGY", "B00000K3AN", "B00AEBBA36", "0792133153", "079212569X", "6305169187", "6301734734", "0792147618", "0792116887", "6304618344", "079213690X", "6303269834", "6304925131", "6305718792", "6304259131", "B00004WIDB", "6304935811", "6303057225", "6304143184", "6302250269"], "bought_together": ["B00000K3AN", "B00AEBBA36"], "also_viewed": ["B00000G3PA", "0792151712", "6300213668", "B00000JS61", "6303215734", "6303402348", "B00004WIDB", "079213690X", "6305750750", "B004751DFU", "B00005O893", "B00000K3AN", "6301792734", "B00E5I2MCM", "6305169187", "B00007LVCM", "B007SPPANM", "B00L4K3MLE", "B00FLML7HW", "B008QZ5PY2", "B00JBGWP3Y"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 234413}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.49, "brand": "", "asin": "B00003CXTF", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HC1ZDJN6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]"}

{"description": "Imagine a Cheech and Chong pothead comedy, only instead of two scruffy  lowlifes, the movie is about an aimless Scottish gardener and a middle-aged  British widow with a green thumb. Grace (Brenda Blethyn ofSecrets and  LiesandLittle Voice) has just discovered that her recently deceased  husband has left her with an enormous debt when her gardener Matthew (Craig  Ferguson,The Big Tease) asks her to help him tend to his small,  personal-use marijuana crop. Grace soon realizes that they can turn her green  house into a hydroponics laboratory and turn out a profitable crop--if only they  can keep the local constables at bay and then find a dealer to actually sell the  stuff.Saving Gracehas well-developed characters, intelligent dialogue,  a charming and capable cast, and clean, clear direction. But at heart it's still  a marijuana comedy, with most of its funniest moments coming from the silly,  stoned behavior of elderly ladies and other stuffy Brits. Nothing wrong with  that, and Blethyn and Ferguson give the film a strong anchor. The ending goes a  little over-the-top, but most of the movie is well-grounded in genuine human  behavior. A subplot about Matthew's girlfriend's pregnancy is treated with  respect and integrity. Sweet, silly, and sincere.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000TG492", "0790748460", "B0050N0UR0", "B00HHYF5DE", "B0046MOVDU", "B00FPPQYXM", "B00000ILEC", "B000LPS2W2", "B00A27O0N4", "B004WBC43E", "B001NFNFIU", "B005FHHD58", "B000FQISV2", "0340977051", "B00CQRNLLU", "B00G35R9ZK", "B000PC6YQC", "B000063K0J", "B0001I55M4", "B001053024", "B000Z27HFE", "B000CDGVPI", "B00FBQ38VQ", "B000ULPFFE", "B00005RYKX", "B000LPS34E", "0091953480", "B004KVXC8C", "0811853756", "B00GSBMNOQ", "B005S9EJ14", "B000BITVAG", "B0009A1BW2", "B0050N0US4", "185782802X", "B000H6SXYW", "B000O7860A", "B00AZMFO6I", "B00GAXASK8", "B008OTTTP6", "B0000CE684", "0091953499", "B007HCI4H0", "B00069WF8U", "B0011KQSZ4", "6305622914", "B000ETRCN0", "630560097X", "B00320J6WS", "B00A27OJ94", "B004SIP7D0", "B0000714BW", "B00H4ZEFTQ", "B00GWXI2RM", "B0038M2S2A", "B0080QOL10", "B005N8KP3Q", "6305428557", "B00EPH8SBM", "B00009IB1D", "B00009MEKA", "B004SIP6BI", "B00GPWEPZ8", "B0028AEO0M", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B00005Y6XU", "B00BEIYGK2", "6305588236", "B0000VD02Y", "B005A1GS00", "B00BCXW106", "B00IBKXP8A", "1250047560", "B000GW8U4A", "B002TY78OQ", "B000SINSYO", "B00069WF94", "B0001US78G", "B00HUAGZ34", "B00AEFXYOA", "B001V7YZHA", "B00GWXI20E", "B00G15MDI0", "B007L6VR12", "B00EF0NVGQ", "B000M8NGYM", "B005WAP2V0", "B00GWXI1F0", "B00006FDAX", "B00GAHJO8G", "B00DL48BM6", "B000EHRVOW", "B000FOPPCE", "B00C888LOO", "B004SIP6C2", "B00GAHG7PE", "B00EIBO8T6", "B00A429YF6", "B00005TNEQ"], "bought_together": ["B00FPPQYXM", "B0050N0UR0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00FPPQYXM", "B00A27O0N4", "B00HHYF5DE", "B00G35R9ZK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 3408}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.76, "brand": "NEW Line Home Video", "asin": "B00003CXMY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51PHoi8EqfL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Saving Grace"}

{"description": "From John Carpenter, the master of horror behind 1998's hit John Carpenter's Vampires and classics like The Thing and Halloween, comes a sci-fi thriller full of explosive action and bone-chilling suspense. Natasha Henstridge (Species) is Melanie Ballard, a headstrong police lieutenant on Mars in the year 2025.

{"description": "Bill Murray is in his early-career, shambling glory as Hunter S. Thompson, the gonzo journalist with a fondness for Wild Turkey and firearms. While Murray does not do as exact an impersonation of Thompson as Johnny Depp (inFear and Loathing in Las Vegas), he does capture Thompson's dazed, anarchic nature. Unfortunately, the movie around him is just anarchic:  a series of episodes (true or invented) from Dr. Thompson's career, circa 1968-72. The haphazard structure is probably meant to suggest the spirit of the counterculture or something, but it's just flabby storytelling. Thanks to Murray's blissful delivery, there are scenes that have a stoned giddiness to them:  Thompson and his attorney (Peter Boyle) terrifying an unsuspecting hitchhiker, or Thompson alone in a men's room with Richard Nixon. Neil Young contributes some music, and Murray warbles \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\" while drunkenly piloting a plane.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001EDFSIQ", "0783229526", "B000S6M1Y4", "B006ISJQ1W", "B003W88QVC", "B003KWWDKA", "B000069HYF", "B00ALU48M0", "B006ISJQBM", "0743250451", "0684873168", "B00ALU46VI", "B002YOKVU4", "0345396359", "B0009PVZD2", "0345410084", "0679785892", "B0047496V4", "B0007UC8Y4", "0743240995", "6305428239", "B007P9HW3M", "0743250443", "0684873249", "0684873214", "B005IX3C4U", "B001TIQT70", "B0015R540S", "B0057ZAA6W", "B0008JIJ2O", "B004164T1U", "B002AF4Y9G", "0345377966", "B00005ATQB", "1439165963", "B00005JMJ4", "B003CRM6PA", "B0012L2JOG", "B0049M7BHA", "1451659717", "0679602984", "B0000648YY", "B000JMK6LW", "B0008KLVA0", "B0004Z33E6", "B008R65Y28", "0767821408", "0446313645", "B0000640VJ", "B0010X8NF0", "B000BX8R10", "B00004RJ73", "B008N2DP5Y", "B0006HBZE2", "0151003874", "B000GGSMC6", "B0000VLLHK", "B00441GYP6", "B00003CXWV", "0684873206", "B000N3SROU", "B007L6VR12", "B00007GZRW", "B000A7DVR2", "B000093FLA", "0783225903", "B008MIMWP8", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B000F6ZIII", "0767812123", "B00004REAG", "B00HLTYRUM", "B000NBK0I8", "B0009GX1CO", "B004SIP6LS", "B000Z8GZYW", "0767830555", "0007204485", "B0000WN0SC", "B004U7MQW4", "B00B4ZN3XQ", "B000EQ45CE", "B00HT2L7VS", "B0002I83Z4", "B0011E5M66", "B003626TNG", "B00005JOJE", "B000068MBS", "B000K7VHTQ", "6305468508", "B00441GZ1E", "6305594333", "B00003CWOL", "0316005282", "B00029RTAI", "B0006HBZEW", "B00JAQJNN0", "B0000VD04M"], "bought_together": ["0783229526"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0783229526", "B006ISJQ1W", "0679785892", "0743250451"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 253881}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 33.55, "brand": "", "asin": "B00003ETIT", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/511M4F5MKBL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Where the Buffalo Roam"}
{"description": "The second grab bag of 007 adventures features three Bonds in five films, including the legendary movie that started it all. In 1962 Sean Connery defined the cinematic James Bond as a tough, charming, and thoroughly professional cold war spy with a license to kill in the lean, hard-edgedDr. No. With Ursula Andress (as the original Bond girl Honey Ryder, who makes her entrance in a bikini), Bond battles a renegade supervillain with little more than his wits, his cunning, and his Walther PPK (this was before Q armed him with the coolest toys a superspy ever had). George Lazenby, a handsome Australian model with a self-effacing confidence, made his first and only appearance as James Bond in the underratedOn Her Majesty's Secret Service, a witty and action-packed adventure that makes 007 history when Bond marries the girl (the lovely and talented Diana Rigg, fresh from her duties as the butt-kicking spy on the TV seriesThe Avengers). Roger Moore brought a light tone and a suave assurance to the series as the third Bond, and the set features three of his seven appearances. InThe Man with the Golden Gun, he battles million-dollar assassin Christopher Lee, one of Bond's most magnetic adversaries.The Spy Who Loved Me, perhaps Moore's finest hour, is a return to the extravagant set pieces and cold war thrills of Connery's pictures and introduces Richard Kiel's steel-dentured Jaws to the series. Jaws returns as a comic figure inMoonraker, a misguided sci-fi entry that takes Bond to space for a physically impressive but dramatically lackluster adventure. More of a mixed bag than the initial seven-filmJames Bond Gift Set, this set is aimed at the Bond completist rather than the general fan. The DVD editions of the films each feature audio commentary by the director and key members of the crew, \"making of\" documentaries, and a host of stills, TV spots, and trailers.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000BYRO9", "B00006BH8G", "B001PPLIEG", "B00AQSN7HE", "B007REV4T8", "B00004WEJZ", "B00000K2SQ", "B00AZFECL8", "B001R10BN2", "B000RPCK1A", "B00000BLFI", "B000RPCK1K", "B000M53GNG", "B000NIBUR6", "B000M53GMW", "B000ICM5V2", "B00004RG62", "B00000BCPF", "B00005JL0I", "B001EDVNNU", "B000RPCK1U", "B000RPCK24", "B000M53GN6", "B000NIBURQ", "B000NDEXPM", "B000M53GM2", "B000M53GMC", "B000NDEXPC", "B000M53GLS", "B005PTYP70", "B000RPCK0Q", "B009RO9LKK", "B000NIBUS0", "B000ICM5VC", "B000NIBURG", "B001F12J0C", "B004BR7XLM", "B00G7QQ0RS", "B00DH34G9S", "B000EHSVS2", "1612185517", "B008YAPQX4", "B0087ZG7Q6", "B000QUU4LY", "B00AZMFJYA", "B002GSXKN8", "B001E75QH0", "B001HQZJMU", "B009PN18R2", "B008JFURII", "B007REV4YI", "B0011NVC98", "B001GCUO1Q", "B00008G8M4", "1618930311", "B008JFUOWM"], "bought_together": ["B0000BYRO9", "B00006BH8G"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B006U1JD5G", "B007REV4T8", "B00006BH8G", "B008YAPQX4"]}, "price": 75.0, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 155749}, "asin": "B00004RG67", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51JTH02YW9L._SX300_.jpg", "title": "The James Bond Collection, Volume 2"}

{"description": "Disney's delightful whodunnit mysteryMurder She Purredis told through the eyes of two four-legged critters considerably smarter than the humans they are observing. Based on the novel by Rita Mae Brown, the film is set in a small Virginia town where secrets run as deep as Southern-style charm. Mary Minor \"Harry\" Haristeen (Ricki Lake) calls the shots around town as she runs the post office. But the real brains of the burb belong to Harry's cat, the acerbic Mrs. Murphy (voiced by Blythe Danner), and the interminably hungry Tucker (voiced by Anthony Clark), a Welsh corgi who suffers from little-dog syndrome. This feline/canine duo is quickly on the scent when a local man is found murdered at the bottom of the lake. All evidence points to Dr. Blair Bainbridge (Linden Ashby) a town newcomer who moves in next to Harry, and, it turns out, has buried some secrets of his own. While local sheriffs try to unmask the murderer, Harry falls for Dr. Bainbridge in spite of his questionable character. As the plot thickens, so do the amusing antics and one-liners from Mrs. Murphy and Tucker. It's up to the animals to solve the mystery, despite their \"pet peeves\" over the bumbling efforts of humans. Lake is terrific as the low-key, likeable, but lonely Harry, and the rest of the cast deliver decent performances, but the biggest kudos go to our furry friends who save the day in a surprise ending that is certain to please family audiences.--Lynn Gibson", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 215661}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "title": "Murder She Purred: A Mrs. Murphy Mystery [VHS]", "related": {"also_viewed": ["0345530489", "0345530500", "B005HWAOH0", "B00005UM23", "B000062XEP", "B00E4Q6TYM", "0553591614", "0345530470", "1484842227", "B00DNLZRLU"]}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51QPJWNS00L._SY300_.jpg", "asin": "B000055ZJQ"}

In the words of frontman Eddie Vedder (whose  liner notes are dated February 14, 2001), this three-hour DVD is \"in some ways  the visual equivalent of the bootlegs that have been released in the past  year... a basic document of what may occur at any given Pearl Jam concert.\"  Well, it's all that and more. The gritty, homespun approach is totally  appropriate for the band's no-frills performance of straightforward, superlative  rock & roll, and the sound recording is nothing less than spectacular,  especially if you honor Vedder's request to \"PLEASE PLAY THIS MOVIE LOUD.\"Singling out highlights is like trying to pick a favorite child; every viewer  will have favorites, and every choice is justified. The death of grunge is Pearl  Jam's blessing. Having proven its endurance, the band flourishes in the absence  of overexposure. Everyone's in peak form (we like the beard, Eddie), and the  DVD's bonus features are both fun and substantial, including city, band, and fan  montages from PJ's earlier European tour, Todd McFarlane's outstanding animated  \"Do the Evolution\" video, and three songs featuring \"Matt Cam,\" fixed on drummer  Matt Cameron, with percussion mixed louder on the Dolby Digital 5.1 audio track.  The only possible complaint is the absence of interviews or backstage footage,  but that's a trivial quibble. It's the music that matters, and as an audiovisual  record of PJ's 2000 tour, this DVD was created with all the right priorities.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["1573301116", "B0000TG9V0", "B000UNYK76", "B0000DGDMF", "B005LLXB9K", "B004WJV6OY", "B005LZYL3G", "1439169217", "B0014YVCDK", "B00ERH15G0", "B0045DO8LA", "B000Q677KO", "B004WJV72K", "B000025QLX", "B0045DO8LK", "B000ETQRCM", "B00F4386PY", "1573301183", "B0000027RL", "B003MX6G7I", "B0054YH7MQ", "B0000DZEE3", "B005EGONFS", "B003XYRLJI", "B0000DYJM6", "B004HCMNQQ", "B0059N4108", "B0000028UK", "B003Y3BMFW", "B000JBWWN8", "B00CIOFWRC", "B007OCD1OE", "B004K7M6Z6", "6305283516", "B00DW1WR14", "B00K6D1HSK", "B000002GJH", "B00005AQ13", "6305019703", "B000WQW988", "B000B7QCQS", "B007OCD1MQ", "B001HY3BNQ", "B0050JN7Z6", "B0001XARDQ", "0578068850", "B000068TOX", "B0000UQQTE", "B0090O07S2", "B000ULQV0W", "B002MRRRAA", "B00008PX8P", "B000001DWG", "B00EAH3GHI", "0140276424", "B001CCKJ2E", "0789302691", "B000BNXDE6", "B005EXA8XC", "B00IQ8TT82", "0859653250", "B00B8XEA86", "B00ILAWJLO", "B00009VTYE", "B0013K1ALE", "B00I5NKP7W", "B000AANBG0", "B00AQO1VYY", "B00BRKZ0EI", "B0002F9BL2", "B007V4QLH4", "B0001ENXYA", "B0000E6XJ9", "B00006RJER", "B00002ZMNV", "B000055XTG", "0783233485", "B000FDFCBE", "B00D7DTTI6", "B0001XAPPQ", "1550228773", "B000QUCQFQ", "B000SSV8HI", "B004USUP12", "B0018M6J72", "1573300411", "B003TN920O", "B001NP8PQW", "B0029SM5ZO", "B00EUEWQ2W", "B004V6MWFU", "B00F3AC6BS", "B00005NG9Z", "B0000UX57K", "B00FKIB3XA", "B004C0019E", "B0000029F8", "B004XCUEXY", "B00884S0UC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0000TG9V0", "B005LLXB9K", "B0000DGDMF", "1573301116"]}, "price": 19.98, "categories": [["CDs & Vinyl", "Pop", "Vocal Pop"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Rock"], ["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 93521}, "asin": "B00005AX6F", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41JT37V9TBL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Pearl Jam - Touring Band 2000"}

{"description": "Gosford Parkfinds director Robert Altman in sumptuously fine form indeed. From the opening shots, as the camera peers through the trees at an opulent English country estate, Altman exploits the 1930s period setting and whodunit formula of the film expertly. Aristocrats gather together for a weekend shooting party with their dutiful servants in tow, and the upstairs/downstairs division of the classes is perfectly tailored to Altman's method (as employed inNashvilleandShort Cuts) of overlapping bits of dialogue and numerous subplots in order to betray underlying motives and the sins that propel them. Greed, vengeance, snobbery, and lust stir comic unrest as the near dizzying effect of brisk script turns is allayed by perhaps Altman's strongest ensemble to date. First and foremost, Maggie Smith is marvelous as Constance, a dependent countess with a quip for every occasion; Michael Gambon, as the ill-fated host, Sir William McCordle, is one of the most palpably salacious characters ever on screen; Kristin Scott Thomas is perfectly cold yet sexy as Lady Sylvia, Sir William's wife; and Helen Mirren, Emily Watson, and Clive Owen are equally memorable as key characters from the bustling servants' quarters below.Gosford Parkmanages to be fabulously entertaining while exposing human shortcomings, compromises, and our endless need for confession.--Fionn Meade", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000BITVAG", "B007A2O3FO", "B00003CXC9", "B005S9EJ14", "B0000CE684", "B00AZMFO6I", "B0080QOL10", "630560097X", "B000LPS34E", "B000E8JNQU", "B004ALIG2O", "B00005UNCB", "B004JMSIQS", "6305692696", "B00F1BFRA6", "B002TZS58I", "B0002DRDY6", "B004SIP7D0", "B000E0ODZE", "B0001US78G", "B004XVMCMQ", "B004XYOQU4", "1557045313", "B005SYZYYK", "B000F3UAFC", "B000063K2Q", "B00003CX8N", "B0009GX1CE", "B001KP2J3U", "B0006Z2NAY", "B008NNY8TK", "B00062IZ0Y", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B005CFBZX4", "B004U7MQZ6", "B0001I55M4", "B00005O7N8", "0788815490", "B00GSBMNOQ", "B003UESJH4", "B0001DCYUU", "B0000797E7", "B008RO6PJQ", "B0013K2ZGI", "B000ETRCN0", "B00005OBAL", "B0009PVZM8", "6305918880", "B0080QOKYS", "B00HUAH14Q", "B00009IB1D", "B000A8AXXG", "B00GWXI16O", "B00C888OFA", "B00GAXASLC", "1250020360", "B000N4SHOE", "B004H0ZHD4", "B0099Y2MYK", "B009B1EPQ4", "B001CW7ZT4", "1573629723", "B009T6CXG0", "B001GJ4U5A", "B004SIP98S", "B00G15MDI0", "B00B62R9XM", "B004SIP9U6", "B0080QOL1A", "B000069HZU", "B004N66XYE", "B004XVMCKS", "1250047900", "B004499LWG", "B00AY2DL78", "6305428557", "B00A1EOC22", "B00D49YEHO", "B00BTYJYR6", "B0001US61O", "B0006Q9482", "B007701RFS", "B0073U2EWM", "B00F98FOI6", "B000092T3P", "B000CCW2O8", "B000065V3V", "B004HHX9H8", "B00HYZ0ZLS", "B00JFH8GZA", "B003DUBAXK", "B00AEFYO5I", "B00005U2KC", "B004SIP7F8", "B00GAHJO8G", "B00005RDRO", "B00DW5IKWK", "B00D3PYQT0", "B00005JOA0"], "bought_together": ["B000BITVAG", "B005S9EJ14"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AZMFO6I", "B000BITVAG", "630560097X", "B00005UNCB"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 7477}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 10.27, "brand": "Universal Studios", "asin": "B00005JKNF", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51oleUlbquL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Gosford Park - Collector's Edition"}

Because Shyamalan works so leanly, the five deleted scenes are excellent, including a chilling scene from the film's final act. Also included are storyboard comparisons and another glimpse of one of Shyamalan's early home movies.Signsis the first of the Vista Series to be a single disc and the extras seem light, but there are only a couple of quibbles: the director again does not provide a commentary track and there is no DTS soundtrack.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00004BZIY", "B00064LJVE", "B001DZOC6Y", "B00003CXQA", "B000JLTR8Q", "B004SIP92O", "B00AEFYYH6", "B003102JDC", "B00005JNTI", "B00000G3PA", "B002GHHHKQ", "B003Y5H4SO", "B0002DB54A", "B00008G8M4", "B00AEBBA2W", "B0000648X0", "630471193X", "B002O3Z50G", "B00011CZRE", "B000PHVZNE", "B0087ZG7HK", "B002NZK5SM", "B00004XPPG", "B00005JOC9", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B0021L8UXA", "0783225733", "B0006L0LOS", "B0006SGYL0", "B000NOKFHQ", "B005LAIHXQ", "0800177029", "6305767866", "B00004TS0G", "6304711891", "B00AEFY3MC", "B002GIBVVG", "B004SIP8ZM", "B000U1ZV8K", "B00005JNY3", "B00070FX5U", "B00AEBB8NI", "B0002KVUKM", "B00008G8LY", "B000F6IOAM", "B00005JN0T", "B00AEBBA36", "B002LMV7R0", "B002NZK5UU", "B0013FDM7E", "B002O3Z4WK", "B0068FZ0GK", "B00015YVDG", "B000LC55F2", "B00001ZWUS", "B002GHHHL0", "B000BTJDGC", "B000EHRVOW", "B0087ZG7J8", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00005JN2Z", "B000P0J0EM", "B00AEFXSLE", "B00019073K", "B00005LC4D", "B00005JL78", "B00IBKXSKA", "B004EPYZPS", "B00000JDIQ", "B00AEBB9WI", "B000RIWAVW", "0780618548", "B004SIP7ZS", "B00005JN0W", "B00AEFXNLY", "6305428115", "0767811100", "0800141601", "B00AEFXT1S", "0780631536", "B00000IQC4", "B004P7CNUY", "B001GCUO02", "B002AS464Q", "B00003CWS3", "B00006FDCD", "B000FS9FCG", "B00005JKZH", "B000067FP8", "B000K7VHQE", "B00BEIYG98", "B00005JNNT", "B000068NNU", "B000XT1P4S", "B0087ZG7PW", "B002O3Z4ZW", "B002I9Z8BM", "B00AEFXKUI", "B0010X73ZG", "B00003CXIP"], "bought_together": ["B00004BZIY", "B004SIP92O"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00004BZIY", "B00386EZUY", "B000QUU4M8", "B0000VCZK2"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 11300}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.99, "brand": "Touchstone Video", "asin": "B00005JL3T", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51c02AOAyCL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Signs"}

{"description": "A Beautiful Mindmanages to twist enough pathos out of John Nash's incredible life story to redeem an at-times goofy portrayal of schizophrenia. Russell Crowe tackles the role with characteristic fervor, playing the Nobel prize-winning mathematician from his days at Princeton, where he developed a groundbreaking economic theory, to his meteoric rise to the cover ofForbesmagazine and an MIT professorship, and on through to his eventual dismissal due to schizophrenic delusions. Of course, it is the delusions that fascinate director Ron Howard and, predictably, go astray. Nash's other world, populated as it is by a maniacal Department of Defense agent (Ed Harris), an imagined college roommate who seems straight out ofDead Poets Society, and an orphaned girl, is so fluid and scriptlike as to make the viewer wonder if schizophrenia is really as slick as depicted. Crowe's physical intensity drags us along as he works admirably to carry the film on his considerable shoulders. No doubt the story of Nash's amazing will to recover his life without the aid of medication is a worthy one, his eventual triumph heartening. Unfortunately, Howard's flashy style is unable to convey much of it.--Fionn Meade", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004SIP7ZS", "B0043X1FL8", "B004FQX5B6", "B00AEFZ63M", "B0000YEEGM", "B00003CWQR", "B000ARTN3I", "B000EHQU0S", "6305144168", "0767811100", "B000066HAS", "B000P0J0EW", "B00AEFYSWM", "B0002B15ZG", "1451628420", "B00000IQV7", "B000021Y7L", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00AEFY5B6", "B003ASLJQI", "B000XJD3JI", "B004SUDQ22", "B004U7MR1Y", "B00A81MV3U", "B0043X1FM2", "B00B0U2SFE", "B002NZK5UK", "B000N6U0E2", "B003B3NGS6", "B00AEBB9F0", "B00AEBB8NI", "B00004RJ73", "B00003CWRX", "B00125WAWS", "B00005JLSB", "6305428352", "B00008EY60", "0800141806", "B00001ZWUS", "B00011CZRE", "B00AEBB9CS", "6304712936", "0780619587", "B00007GZR5", "B000YAF4MA", "B000KX0IOA", "B004SIP8W0", "B00080ZG10", "B00B9LNPA6", "0783225733", "B003U0AHBO", "B00004BZIY", "B00005JND5", "B000E33VWW", "B003NF97NK", "B0038M2AZA", "B002CPMB9O", "B000P0J0EM", "B000A3XY5A", "B00AFEXRME", "B00005Q4CS", "B000LC55F2", "B00AEBB9SM", "B0006FYOTC", "B000056VP4", "B002WNU0QW", "B000RTB0R6", "0684819066", "B00003CXZ4", "B00AEFY17E", "B000EGDB10", "B002VECM6S", "B002ZG980U", "B001P9KR8U", "B001N44BVQ", "B000LP6KNU", "B0007DFJ0G", "B0002V7ON8", "B0018CWW5K", "B00JPQ1INI", "B0030Y12FU", "B003ELKNH2", "B000K2UGZM", "B00121QGPY", "B0001CNRAM", "B00003CXFV", "0783223609", "B007N31YH0", "B002HK9IDQ", "B005BYBZEK", "B000JJ5F8O", "B00AEFYXJ0", "B003UESJHO", "B00A7MSQSO", "B004SIP9U6", "B00005JL78", "B00012QLB4", "B003UESJH4", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B000K7VHQE"], "bought_together": ["B004SIP7ZS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00C7MW5EI", "B004SIP7ZS", "B001F34HRS", "B00001ZWUS"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 3605}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.99, "brand": "UNI DIST CORP.

{"description": "It's not that the folks at Pixar are geniuses when it comes to DVDs... well, come to think of it, their fifth DVD set shows these folks are wizards. It's not just that the two discs are packed with watchable extras that hardly reiterate the same information; it's how they are handled--funny, inventive, with a light touch--unlike many PR-driven discs. A good place to start is the filmmakers' jolly commentary track, which branches off into 31 minutes of behind-the-scene stuff, deleted scenes, and curious anecdotes (they can also be watched separately). Pixar's first making-of documentary is a most concise and interesting 25-minute examination that also sheds light on how the company works. With a digital-to-digital transfer, the film looks great and is available in widescreen or reformatted to full screen. The \"Family Fun\" disc includes another Pixar made-for-the-DVD gem, the 7-minute \"Exploring the Reef\" with Jean-Michel Cousteau (Jacques's son) being upstaged by Dori and Marlin; it's a hoot and teaches a fact or two you will remember about reefs.

{"description": "Outstanding picture and sound plus tons of features makeCharlie's Angels: Full Throttlea fully loaded DVD.  Don't expect more T&A; in the unrated edition, however.  The only difference is glimpses of more intense violence in a few of the fight scenes.  For example, in the theatrical version you'll see an angel flying through the air, but in the unrated version you'll then see her lying expressionless on the ground.  Also, blood flies out of Drew Barrymore's mouth in one scene.  On his commentary track, director McG discusses inside jokes, visual effects, and shots that didn't quite work for him.  Like a TV sportscaster, he uses a telestrator, but only to occasionally circle items of interest or draw arrows.  There's also an amusing commentary track by the three writers, who chuckle over inside jokes and discuss how the film was changed from the original script.  They preface their comments with: \"I guess they asked us to do this just to prove that writers worked on this movie.\"  \"Who are we kidding?  Who's listening to this right now?\"If you want still more info, there's a trivia track with pop-up factoids with occasional links to more featurettes, a jukebox that offers clips of 11 songs and explanations of why they were picked, a cameo-graphy that offers clips of 13 personalities and why we should know them, and eight 4- to 18-minute featurettes exploring such topics as stunts, vehicles, costumes, and the Pussycat Dolls dance troupe.  And in the next evolution of product placement, the DVD-ROM \"Shop the Scene\" feature allows you to search for a character's outfit or gadget then buy it online.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002A5EBMQ", "B00164EAGY", "B00003CXZ1", "B00AEFYGBA", "B000069HYG", "B0000SX9N2", "B00005JL8Z", "B00004ZDO9", "B008H6GHII", "B000UDGOC0", "B007AFC0RY", "B0006L0LOS", "B000085EFK", "B0007P0Y7C", "B00003CXMP", "B00024JC4E", "B00016MSV2", "B0007PLLBU", "B001C5LLQ4", "B00005MEVO", "B000BKJ758", "B000MX7V70", "B000035Z3G", "B002GHHHL0", "B000LC3ICE", "B000FDFSH2", "B0006GANPA", "B000Y11BC6", "B000AP04FG", "B00026ZG10", "B0041KKYGU", "B00005JMUA", "0767819640", "B0018PH3KQ", "B00008G7UI", "B00BLN4V0A", "B002GOAH1A", "B00006HAWN", "B0001BS3IE", "B0009RCPUW", "B002ZG984Q", "B001EDVNNU", "B000VI70QS", "B004LWZW2O", "B000A343RI", "B0006FO8E8", "B000EGDB10", "B000RW3VCU", "B00005JN4H", "B00BTYMPUY", "B00005J761", "B000CEXGAU", "B005TK0MFE", "B0041ONFOE", "B000VG66XS", "B00ID8H98C", "B00007AJF5", "B00AEFXO8Q", "B0009W5JR8", "B008JFURII", "B00001PE4D", "B000M7FOO8", "B004P7CN7W", "B0000DZ6N3", "B00005JM5B", "B00007GZRP", "B000ARXF96", "B0018CNNV2", "B000CCW2P2", "B0009KA2OA", "B002O3Z4ZW", "B00006G8JD", "B0008FXT1Y", "B0000524E5", "B002GSXKOW", "B00005JM55", "B003Q6D2B4", "B005CFBYW6", "B00008WJD6", "B000ENC5YW", "B003FCKI3O", "B005Z9MFRC", "B00004STVN", "B00005JG6N", "B00E1HIXEI", "B0007OCG56", "B00005JMEW", "B000BTIU4S", "B00008WJEZ", "B000NIBURQ", "B000EQ5V8G", "B0001Z37HM", "B003PIUINS", "B00005JMW7", "B00196UTEG", "B000A2IPQY", "B004SIP6VI", "B00005JLZW", "B00005JNTU", "B00AEFXCLU"], "bought_together": ["B002A5EBMQ", "B00AEFYGBA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002A5EBMQ", "B0000CABE5", "B000069HYG", "B008JFUUIA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 26650}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.9, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B00005JLYW", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51L5TYVcBmL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle (Unrated Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "A broad science fiction thriller in a classic vein,Equilibriumtakes a respectable stab at aFahrenheit 451-like cautionary fable. The story finds Earth's post-World War III humankind in a state of severe emotional repression: If no one feels anything, no one will be inspired by dark passions to attack their neighbors. Writer-director Kurt Wimmer's monochromatic,Metropolis-influenced cityscape provides an excellent backdrop to the heavy-handed mission of John Preston (Christian Bale), a top cop who busts \"sense offenders\" and crushes sentimental, sensual, and artistic relics from a bygone era. Predictably, Preston becomes intrigued by his victims and that which they die to cherish; he stops taking his mandatory, mood-flattening drug and is even aroused by a doomed prisoner (Emily Watson). Wimmer's wrongheaded martial arts/dueling guns motif is sheer silliness (a battle over a puppy doesn't help), butEquilibriumshould be seen for Bale's moving performance as a man shocked back to human feeling.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00006JDVV", "B000LC55F2", "B000FS9FCG", "B0009A40ES", "B000KX0IM2", "B0007Y08QA", "B00AEFYCW8", "0767805712", "B00005JL78", "B0018O4YT0", "B001FB55HQ", "B00003CXZ4", "B00AEFXCLU", "B000FGGE68", "B000WMA6R8", "B002ZG980U", "B003XURDAY", "B00HOGBXS6", "B00005JPAR", "B000GFLKF8", "B00K2CHX9C", "B00AEFXW8I", "B000XR9L50", "B004XQO90O", "B000N6TX1I", "B000FKO5QK", "B004SIP9Z6", "B007WZTMCI", "B0007DFJ0G", "B000093FLA", "B0073U2FB2", "0783225814", "B000K7VHQ4", "B001OQCVI8", "B00011CZRE", "B000P0J0AQ", "B00000JSJC", "B0000AXE8I", "B008JFUQZ2", "B007X4ECMI", "B002ZG97CO", "B00AZMFJYA", "B008JFUO36", "B004P2VQZC", "B0000AC8LR", "B0045HCJT4", "B00J5LXT6M", "B00AEFY5B6", "B002UZCJ8Y", "B001GZ6QC4", "B00177Y9ZC", "B003UESJHO", "B000XA5K48", "B001DJLD1M", "B008JFUN50", "B005LAIHXQ", "B00K7IPFSM", "B0006IIPIK", "B005LAII8A", "B0013PSTMC", "B008JFUNHI", "B001L57ZYM", "B002QEHPQU", "B0034G4ORC", "B004SIP95G", "0767802519", "B001TOD92C", "B008JFUS0U", "B000087F6L", "B0051MKNV8", "B007WXUVHU", "B005LAIH2C", "B000R9U3B0", "B004LWZW7E", "B000MZHW40", "B00005JNJV", "B00005JPD0", "B000GGSMC6", "B0000ACOXL", "B0085A9HU6", "B009YQJ322", "B003Y5H5GK", "B009MO57H6", "B004LWZW4M", "0800195175", "B002QW7ALM", "B00005JMA8", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B001EAWMGA", "B002O3Z4WU", "B000BW7QWW", "B001GUYB08", "B00005V9HH", "B001UV4XWY", "B00A8MGIZG", "B002GSXKNI", "B00IARA8KM", "B004LWZWGA", "B00005JA8B", "B001QTXM5Y"], "bought_together": ["B000LC55F2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0007Y08QA", "B006ZL1PGG", "B000LC55F2", "B004P7CMJG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 61424}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.34, "brand": "Dimension", "asin": "B00005JLWN", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51K2WVH130L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Equilibrium"}

{"description": "Even though it's only a single disc, the28 Days LaterDVD includes a lot of very interesting features, including the alternate ending that was shown after the end of the film a couple months into its theatrical run.  It's much bleaker, as director Danny Boyle and writer Alex Garland say in their optional commentary.  Another alternate ending is almost the same as the theatrical ending but slightly less happy.  Most interesting is the \"radical\" alternate ending that takes an entirely different path midway through the film.  It wasn't filmed, however, so Boyle and Garland narrate the action over storyboards, and it's a surprisingly engrossing 11 minutes.  Boyle and Garland also did a commentary track for the film, and they talk about how they were able to get the shots of deserted London and why they used the ending they did.  There are also six very watchable deleted scenes, and Boyle and Garland's comments range from \"great sequence\" to \"a disgrace.\" Slightly less relevant is a 24-minute documentary that spends its first 10 minutes on the real-life threat of infectious diseases before recapping the film and discussing such elements as the use of digital video and the boot camp the actors had to attend. If you need any further proof that the DVD was a labor of love, even the stills galleries have commentaries.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000TJBN80", "B0002ABURA", "B0006A9FKA", "B002WY65VU", "B00111YM5Q", "B0013D8LAE", "B000IHY9TS", "B000Y7U98C", "B00005JO16", "B0021L8UXA", "B0001611DI", "B0013D8LA4", "B000RJO56O", "B002JT69IW", "B001D2WU9I", "B002VWNIDG", "B0002CHK1S", "B00D7AM6M0", "B003UGLCIA", "B00AEFYYH6", "B001MVYUR0", "B000UAE7O0", "B003EYVXYG", "B000EHRVP6", "B0028DRGDQ", "B0021L8UPS", "B001NPD9LS", "B005LAIIMG", "B000FAOC2W", "B000LP6KNU", "B0006SSOHC", "B000WC3864", "B0013FDM7E", "B00000K3TO", "B000RIWAVW", "B000GCFO0I", "B000O76ZQC", "B004LWZW24", "B000RJO578", "B002VKB0KG", "B006ISJR7U", "B00004TS0G", "B004SIP9MY", "B002VKE1K2", "B00G5GNYY2", "B000N6TX1I", "B0024FADD8", "B005QUQRBU", "B001MYIXAC", "B00D3DJIG8", "B001GUYB08", "B000TGJ80S", "B000V4UFZK", "B004SIP92O", "B00009MGEM", "B0010X73ZG", "B00005K3NR", "B002LMSWN2", "B000063RQQ", "B00000ILDD", "B004BZ5AN2", "0767802519", "B00001QGUM", "B00AJLHUA8", "B002SJIO4A", "B00005JMUA", "B00J5LXT6M", "B005J9ZFQG", "B000QQJ3Q0", "B000AXWHSA", "B00BEIYMAG", "B00005JLWN", "B004BLJQOK", "B0015ET3YO", "B008220BLG", "B000031WD9", "B000069HZP", "B000EQ5SRK", "B0007Y08QA", "B000PMLJMQ", "B000BUNZY2", "B002ZG98UA", "B000V4UH08", "B001JNNDJM", "B003HKN52U", "B003UAKEBW", "B0007DFJ0G", "B0019X3YX2", "B00CE00ZV8", "B00003CXCF", "B0009WFEDC", "B000FS9FE4", "B00005JNJV", "B00011CZRE", "B002T9H2LA", "B000RW5BZ0", "B00005JMXX", "B000WC389G", "B007STBUHI", "B002ZG983M"], "bought_together": ["B000TJBN80", "B002WY65VU"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B008SAPC20", "B003J42JLC", "B000Y7U98C", "B0002ABURA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 37382}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.25, "brand": "Twentieth Century Fox", "asin": "B00005JMA8", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/511KHM89SFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "28 Days Later (Widescreen Special Edition)"}

{"description": "With this silent-era spectacle, Cecil B. DeMille cemented his reputation as the master of the biblical epic. DeMille tells the story of Christ's life and Passion with great attention to historical accuracy, along the way paying homage to the religious illustrations of Da Vinci and Dor&#xE9;, and, in a modern flourish, restaging Christ's resurrection in luminous Technicolor. In time for Christmas, Criterion will present fully restored editions of both versions of this glorious spectacle in a heavenly two-disc set: the original 155-minute silent version from 1927 - never before available on home video - and the 1931 release, re-cut by DeMille to 112 minutes. The DVD edition will also include new Dolby Digital 5.1 scores by composers Donald Sosin (1927 version) and Timothy J. Tikker (1931 version); the original score for the 1931 release by Hugo Riesenfeld; behind-the-scenes footage from the making of the film; cast portraits, production and costume sketches, a stills gallery of production photos and promotional material; the original illustrated program and press book featuring photographs from the film's gala premiere; and more.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000E8JO32", "B002AT8KBU", "B00008H2H0", "B0002BO05S", "B001BSBBIU", "B004GJYR8W", "B0000633QW", "B006TTC5MM", "B00KE3B6NI", "B00ALTQRUC", "B00007CVS8", "B00L3ZB7PS", "B002Z2X7GK", "B000CZ0O54", "B00JPUUSEE", "B001253YM8", "0767827929", "B00JPUUQ5A", "B00004WI56", "B004RUF9DC", "B000CNESNA", "B00HRYH6GI", "B000HT3QBO", "B00GPPXNLC", "B001NSLE5I", "B001NSLE4Y", "B001E18222", "B00HRHZ5BI", "B00IF0KAYS", "0780022343", "B004OOL73W", "B00D9BNONW", "B004NWPY7A", "B000E8N8SE", "B00AQ6J5YA", "B004RA5AU4", "B000TEUSI6", "B004KZH5LI", "B0000B1O9L", "B000UJCAK4", "B00H7BJ128", "B00EVU3SO0", "B0009S4IJM", "B00HE011DE", "B0045FVEKG", "B007N5YJPC", "B006TTC5A4", "B00005JN8Z", "B003N2CVRC", "B00008LDO7", "B003NXH2TS", "B000CNE0M4", "B0009S4IKG", "B002XDR5QY", "B001ECQ6E2", "B0002DCHQA", "B000E6ESXK", "B001QFFBAC", "B00005JKSC", "B00GBT6332", "B0085A9K3K", "B000QGE8JC", "B004L2KMTM", "B000BC8T0K", "B004WPYO8I", "B009RNK10K", "B00AEFZDNA", "B00GBT62N8", "B00AEBB9JQ", "B000056AXZ", "B00ICWO1LC", "B00005J75F", "B0009S4IJ2", "6305268150", "B001CD6HQA", "B00049QJ9I", "B00005B6L0", "B000YRY7VC", "B0006Q93ZG", "B00014NF66", "B00DZP1BVO", "B00GPPXP6A", "B0009X770E", "B00HE010LC", "B000HA4WRU", "B00005JH9B", "B00DZP1BY6", "B001QFFBAM", "B0020LA3YK", "B00CUKTGSA", "B00A01CQIS", "B000BDH64E", "B000O76Q0C", "6305257442", "B00BX49C3S", "B008CJ0JR0", "B0074JOUHE", "B0082CDGSG", "B0082SIAD6", "B00687XO1G"], "bought_together": ["B0000633QW", "B0002BO05S"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002AT8KBU", "B0002BO05S", "B0000633QW", "B000E8JO32"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 157098}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 33.98, "brand": "TORRENCE,ERNEST", "asin": "B00005JNGA", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41TD97CHZQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The King of Kings (The Criterion Collection)"}
{"description": "There's a pretty good gimmick with these DVD extras aimed squarely at the pre-teen/early teen audience that ate up this film.

Decipher the clues and unlock the next set of extras: a nice bit on real treasure hunters, an awful piece on the Knights Templar, and one gem for kids: \"Riley Poole's Decode this!\" Actor Justin Bartha reprises his role (Nic Cage's techno-sidekick) and lectures a bit on the cooler side of language history and code-breaking with a few simple interactive games. If you get through it all, you unlock a hidden feature, a trivia track. Thankfully, those who do not want to go on the treasure hunt can access these features by reading the printed insert.

{"description": "Jamie Foxx's uncannily accurate performance isn't the only good thing aboutRay. Riding high on a wave of Oscar buzz, Foxx proved himself worthy of all the hype by portraying blind R&B; legend Ray Charles in a warts-and-all performance that Charles approved shortly before his death in June 2004. Despite a few dramatic embellishments of actual incidents (such as the suggestion that the accidental drowning of Charles's younger brother caused all the inner demons that Charles would battle into adulthood), the film does a remarkable job of summarizing Charles's strengths as a musical innovator and his weaknesses as a philandering heroin addict who recorded some of his best songs while flying high as a kite. Foxx seems to be channeling Charles himself, and as he did with the life of Ritchie Valens in La Bamba, director Taylor Hackford gets most of the period details absolutely right as he chronicles Ray's rise from \"chitlin circuit\" performer in the early '50s to his much-deserved elevation to legendary status as one of the all-time great musicians. Foxx expertly lip-syncs to Ray Charles' classic recordings, but you could swear he's the real deal in a film that honors Ray Charles without sanitizing his once-messy life.--Jeff ShannonMore on Ray CharlesModern Sounds in Country and Western Music(CD)The Genius of Ray Charles(CD)Ray Charles and Betty Carter--Dedicated to You(CD)Genius & Soul--The 50th Anniversary Collection(CD)Ray: A Tribute to the Movie, the Music, and the Man(book)More Albums by Ray Charles", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000E8QVWY", "B001P3SA94", "B00465I1CE", "B00005JKMQ", "6305428409", "B003BV8I3Q", "B00AEFXTKO", "B0002LE9HC", "B000BOH8X2", "B00AEFYG3S", "0790739313", "B000JJSL1W", "B000A50460", "B00005TQ44", "0783230524", "B0009R1TJ0", "0780627822", "B00AEFZ63M", "B000P0J092", "B002VWNICM", "B00EV4EUT8", "B000JLTRH2", "B000N6U0E2", "B0041QSZS8", "0783237367", "078324228X", "B00AEFY6TW", "B003HKN534", "B00BTYPWDQ", "B00G4Q3KOC", "B00007AJG1", "B00007L4KF", "B00ANDDBBY", "B000BITV9W", "0783114907", "B00007AJG2", "1558908390", "B00005JLRZ", "B000FVQLQQ", "6305692572", "0767821637", "B002CA68NO", "B00AFEXRME", "B002CPMB9O", "B004SIP93S", "B000063JDI", "B00005NB8K", "B00125WAWS", "6305505780", "B000IFRT4W", "B001TUZGPO", "B009NNM9OA", "B000RB6XG2", "B000P0J0CY", "B0001FR3IQ", "B000FVQLRA", "B00066FAVW", "B002XMGGK6", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00DW5IL2E", "B00005JPK8", "0767811070", "B000I0QL7I", "B000069I0E", "B00080ZG10", "0306814315", "B000P0J0EM", "B00AEFXP8K", "B00049QQHI", "B00000JGHV", "B0007CEXYK", "B0001Q4BOE", "B0000YEE6M", "B000NIVJF4", "B008Y1YJN6", "B00066VTU8", "B001132GNY", "B0006QAIG4", "B0034G4OSG", "B000C20VRS", "0800141741", "B00A2H9QN8", "B000Y11B8K", "B00005LB86", "B000056VP4", "B00005JL72", "B000095J01", "B000Q7ZNZ4", "B002CAWNEM", "B003UESJHO", "B00066FAQW", "0783230389", "B0013FDM7E", "B00007ELEO", "B00AMEZDJW", "B000P0J0CE", "B003Y5H4ZC", "0767821955", "B00003GPFT", "B0021L8V2A"], "bought_together": ["B000E8QVWY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0002LE9HC", "B000E8QVWY", "B000BOH8X2", "B00AZMFJYA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 17277}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.89, "brand": "Universal Studios", "asin": "B00005JND5", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41RQ8ETK19L._SX300_.jpg", "title": "Ray (Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "As paranoid cop Del Spooner, Will Smith (Independence Day,Men in Black) displays both his trademark quips and some impressive pectoral muscles inI, Robot. Only Spooner suspects that the robots that provide the near future with menial labor are going to turn on mankind--he's just not sure how. When a leading roboticist dies suspiciously, Spooner pursues a trail that may prove his suspicions. Don't expect much of a connection to Isaac Asimov's classic science fiction stories;I, Robot, the action movie, isn't prepared for any ruminations on the significance of artificial intelligence. This likable, efficient movie won't break any new ground, but it does have an idea or two to accompany its jolts and thrills, which puts it ahead of most recent action flicks. Also featuring Bridget Moynahan (The Sum of All Fears), Bruce Greenwood (The Sweet Hereafter), and James Cromwell (Babe,LA Confidential).--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0013FDM7E", "B0013J55B6", "B005LAIGPA", "B00005JL78", "B00008G8M4", "B005LAIHXQ", "B00003CXXP", "B004AOECXI", "B00005JMXX", "B005LAIHYU", "6305428115", "B0049IHX2C", "B004LWZW9W", "B008Y1YK9Y", "B0067EKYAY", "B005LAIIHG", "B00177YA1K", "B001QERPAC", "B002ZG980U", "630587493X", "B000VG66XS", "B000N6U0E2", "B00005JKWX", "B002UZCJ8Y", "B000957O82", "B004LWZW4M", "B004UXUX4Q", "B00DV2MVWO", "B005LAIGRS", "B0000844I8", "B004LWZW8I", "B002ZG997C", "B00AEFXPSK", "B000AP04FG", "B008MIMWQW", "B006TTC5PY", "B00070FX5U", "B00081912E", "B0009MDPYM", "B00005JNTU", "0553294385", "B004XQO90O", "B00CWM58WY", "B001L57ZYM", "B00E8RKHWW", "B00005JPD0", "B00AEBB86A", "B007REV4T8", "B000FFL2G6", "B00005JL3K", "B001TODCII", "B00AEFXCLU", "B003UYUQZW", "B00000G3PA", "B0001NBNDY", "6305767866", "B0002V7OI8", "B000GFLKF8", "B003Q6D2B4", "B00005JKMQ", "B0000B1OFL", "B00AAQHP66", "055338256X", "B0000ACOXL", "B0090SI56Y", "0783225733", "B00AEFZ2DG", "B00003CWU3", "B00BB67UNW", "B00005JN0W", "B00005JNQS", "B00AEFYCW8", "B001GZ6QC4", "B0002KVUKM", "B00561BNI6", "B002GOAH1A", "B000GBEWHK", "B0000959N0", "B002I9Z8EO", "B000TGJ8CQ", "B00005JMZK", "B001OQCV2E", "B00004Z4WR", "B002O3Z510", "B000JYW5BE", "B000FS9FCG", "B00005JNTI", "B00BTYOYG2", "B002SG7Z7A", "B00A7MSQRK", "B000AYELVA", "B002ZG98LO", "B000ENC5YW", "0783240295", "B002GHHHME", "B005LAII3A", "B0045HCJ9O", "B00LG6YEKE", "B002NXSRVG", "B00004BZIY"], "bought_together": ["B004AOECXI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AZMFJYA", "B002SG7Z7A", "B00005JA8B", "B0087ZG7HK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 8757}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.0, "brand": "Twentieth Century Fox", "asin": "B00005JN0T", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/513MNJSY0FL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "I, Robot (Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "Movies don't come any bigger than Peter Jackson'sKing Kong, a three-hour remake of the 1933 classic that marries breathtaking visual prowess with a surprising emotional depth. Expanding on the original story of the blonde beauty and the beast who falls for her, Jackson creates a movie spectacle that matches hisLord of the Ringsfilms and even at times evokes their fantasy world while celebrating the glory of '30s Hollywood. Naomi Watts stars as Ann Darrow, a vaudeville actress down on her luck in Depression-era New York until manic filmmaker Carl Denham (a game but miscast Jack Black) entices her with a lead role. Dazzled by the genius of screenwriter Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody), Ann boards the tramp steamer S.S.Venture, which she--and most of the wary crew--believes is headed for Singapore. Denham, however, is in search of the mythic Skull Island, hoping to capture its wonders on film and make a fortune. What he didn't count on were some scary natives who find that the comely Darrow looks like prime sacrifice material for a mysterious giant creature....There's no point in rehashing the entire plot, as every movie aficionado is more than familiar with the trajectory ofKing Kong; the challenge facing Jackson, his screenwriters, and the phenomenal visual-effects team was to breathe new life into an old, familiar story. To that degree, they achieve what could be best called a qualified success. Though they've assembled a crackerjack supporting cast, including Thomas Kretschmann as theVenture's hard-bitten captain and young Jamie Bell as a plucky crewman, the first third of the movie is rather labored, with too much minute detail given over to sumptuous re-creations of '30s New York and the unexciting initial leg of theVenture's sea voyage. However, once the film finds its way to Skull Island (which bears more than a passing resemblance toLOTR's Mordor),Kongturns into a dazzling movie triumph, by turns terrifying and awe-inspiring. The choreography and execution of the action set pieces--including one involving Kong and a trio of Tyrannosaurus Rexes, as well as another that could be charitably described as a bug-phobic's nightmare--is nothing short of landmark filmmaking, and a certain Mr. Spielberg should watch his back, asKongtrumps most anything that has come before it.Despite the visual challenges ofKing Kong, the movie's most difficult hurdle is the budding romance between Ann and her simian soulmate. Happily, this is where Jackson unqualifiedly triumphs, as this unorthodox love story is tenderly and humorously drawn, by turns sympathetic and wondrous. Watts, whose accessibility balances out her almost otherworldly loveliness, works wonders with mere glances, and Andy Serkis, who digitally embodies Kong here much as he did Gollum in theLOTRfilms, breathes vibrant life into the giant star of the film without ever overplaying any emotions. The final, tragic act of the film, set mostly atop the Empire State Building, is whereKongearns its place in movie history as a work that celebrates both the technical and emotional heights that film can reach.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"bought_together": ["B000EHQTZO", "B00AEFYEU8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000EHQTZO", "B00AEFYEU8", "B0087ZG7HK", "0767817478"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 32487}, "categories": [["Movies & TV"]], "price": 8.94, "brand": "Universal Studios", "asin": "B00005JO20", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/513Y54TGdwL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "King Kong (Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "More than a few critics hailedSpider-Man 2as \"the best superhero movie ever,\" and there's no compelling reason to argue--thanks to a bigger budget, better special effects, and a dynamic, character-driven plot, it's a notch aboveSpider-Manin terms of emotional depth and rich comic-book sensibility.Ordinary PeopleOscar-winner Alvin Sargent received screenplay credit, and celebrated author and comic-book expert Michael Chabon worked on the story, but it's director Sam Raimi's affinity for the material that bringsSpidey 2to vivid life. When a fusion experiment goes terribly wrong, a brilliant physicist (Alfred Molina) is turned into Spidey's newest nemesis, the deranged, mechanically tentacled \"Doctor Octopus,\" obsessed with completing his experiment and killing Spider-Man (Tobey Maguire) in the process. Even more compelling is Peter Parker's urgent dilemma: continue his burdensome, lonely life of crime-fighting as Spider-Man, or pursue love and happiness with Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst)? Molina's outstanding as a tragic villain controlled by his own invention, and the action sequences are nothing less than breathtaking, but the real success ofSpider-Man 2is its sense of priorities. With all of Hollywood's biggest and best toys at his disposal, Raimi and his writers stay true to the Marvel mythology, honoringSpider-Mancreators Stan Lee and Steve Ditko, and setting the bar impressively high for the challenge ofSpider-Man 3.--Jeff ShannonDVD Features:The first commentary track is by director Sam Raimi and a self-deprecating Tobey Maguire speaking in tandem, and producer (and Marvel CEO) Avi Arad and coproducer Grant Curtis speaking in tandem. They discuss a number of topics, including Raimi's memory of his excitement over Richard Donner's Superman and how the character of Black Cat had to be dropped from the film. The second commentary is by six members of the Oscar-nominated effects team, and one of their primary focuses is how Doc Ock's arms were achieved by a combination of puppetry and CGI.The centerpiece of the second disc is a massive two-hour documentary that can be viewed all at once or in 12 separate pieces. It covers the development of the story, the visual effects, costumes, stunts, and sound and music. Three shorter featurettes cover Peter Parker's struggle between his personal and hero lives, Doc Ock, and the women in Spider-Man's life, and what's interesting is how they discuss those topics not just in relation to the movies but to the comic books as well. (For example, Betty Brant and Gwen Stacy had a much greater impact in the comics.) There's a scene in which you can toggle among three different camera angles, and a gallery of 17 paintings Alex Ross created for the opening sequence. The sound and picture are spectacular, though only theSuperbit editionhas DTS.--David HoriuchiMore Spiderman on DVDTheSpidermanToy StoreThe First FilmSpider Manon the small screenThe SoundtrackGame Boy AdvanceThe BookMore Superheroes on DVDBatmanBladeThe HulkJimmy NeutronJustice LeagueKim PossibleRobocopSpider-ManSupermanWonder WomanX-MenAlso see our Action & Adventure StoreStills fromSpider-Man 2(click for larger image)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000UR9T8C", "B00005JKCH", "B004LWZWFQ", "B001DHXT20", "B00E5I2MCM", "B00005JNTU", "B000VI70QS", "B001CDR1FG", "B001GCUO1Q", "B000AYELVA", "B00E5I2M6I", "B000AYELVU", "B008JFUO72", "B0083SBMBM", "B004LWZW42", "B004EPZ07K", "B00005JNJV", "B0002IQMAM", "B00E5I2MEK", "B000OVLBF8", "B00E5I2M9K", "B000HEVZ9E", "B008QZ5PY2", "B000HCO83Q", "B00JPS7HOA", "B001QB9H1U", "B00IGVJGYQ", "B0000959N0", "B0007P0Y7C", "B002GSXKN8", "B008JFUPFI", "B000J10EQU", "B0007V6ITE", "B0090SI56Y", "B001GZ6QC4", "6307397594", "B008JFUS0U", "B000IJ79VQ", "B000VR0570", "B002ZG99B8", "B00005JKWJ", "B004LWZWGA", "B005G4TJUC", "B002IPFWTE", "B00005JM5E", "B005LAIGW8", "0767817478", "B000H30B2C", "B002A5EBLW", "B0006L0LOS", "B000U7WV1Y", "B0000VCZLG", "B000P0J06K", "B002GSXKNI", "B002HWRYJE", "B0004Z33EQ", "B0009A409S", "B001DJLD2G", "B000I0RQVI", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B0007RT9MG", "B001GKJ2E8", "B0000AXE8I", "B007K3JFUQ", "B00004STUL", "B00BEZTMFY", "B000P0J06U", "B000957O82", "1402778007", "B0039N74CW", "B003UESJF6", "B00F4FFO8E", "B001HN697M", "B001OST0LW", "B0060FXDCG", "B0049IHX2C", "B000P0J0A6", "B000CEVC9M", "B000UVKGPI", "B009JBWOU0", "B00005JM5B", "B00I6JOD2S", "B001EDVNNU", "B000O77SRC", "B0000633UA", "B000P6XQ50", "B000E8M0VA", "B00008G8M4", "B000EGDB10", "B007REV4T8", "B00BPA2PEI", "B008Y1YK9Y", "B005OY6LBE", "0780624890", "B002935GMS", "0767803434", "6305428042", "B000O78KW4", "B009HIKAN8"], "bought_together": ["B000UR9T8C", "B00005JKCH"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004LWZWFQ", "B003YAR97K", "B00005JKCH", "B000UR9T8C"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 9593}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.0, "brand": "Marvel Kids", "asin": "B00005JMQW", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51529JJX43L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Spider-Man 2 (Widescreen Special Edition)"}

{"description": "The lurid scenario--a nymphomaniacal white trash nymphet (Christina Ricci) is held prisoner by a bitter bluesman (Samuel L. Jackson)--gives way to an affecting tale of redemption inBlack Snake Moan, writer/director Craig Brewer's follow-up to the acclaimedHustle & Flow. Lazarus (Jackson,Jungle Fever,Pulp Fiction) finds Rae (Ricci,Monster,The Ice Storm) beaten unconscious on the road in front of his backwoods house. After bringing her inside, he learns of her wanton ways and decides to exorcise his own demons by curing Rae of her sexual compulsion.Black Snake Moancould have been terrible, but Brewer takes his story seriously enough to dig into the genuine emotions of such a situation (though along the way he certainly flirts with sexploitation overtones--several scenes look like they were plucked straight out of a hitherto unknown 1970s trash classic). Ricci, Jackson, and the supporting cast (including pop star Justin Timberlake, giving a surprisingly good performance as Rae's boyfriend) treat the characters with respect, honesty, and humor. The result is off-kilter and maybe a little too fond of its sleazy cinematic forbears to truly hit the emotional notes it's after, butBlack Snake Moanhas considerably more substance than its marketing would suggest.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B003IY498Y", "B00AEFYAC0", "B0029Z8K74", "B000NO39FG", "B0050ODZ6M", "B000L211NC", "B004P7CN3G", "B000HC2M0C", "B001URA5Y8", "B000Q6GUSO", "B00006SFJJ", "B0037QGS0A", "0767821009", "B008B9JTLI", "B002PB4I50", "B003HTSJAY", "B00DHDDE1Y", "B00008Z463", "B00005R87R", "B00005JMON", "B0004Z3242", "B000092T3X", "B00AEBB89W", "B007ZC31R0", "B00008972P", "B00005JLD1", "B000JBXHQY", "B003VA3JZY", "B00005JH9M", "B000MZHW40", "B000JMK6OE", "B0041KKZGY", "B0002A2WDQ", "B0006210ZG", "B0017M9ZNI", "6305127654", "0780618548", "B0033PSH68", "B001JNNDJM", "B00AEBBA72", "B000OCZ9WS", "B000KX0IM2", "0790776960", "B000OYC7BW", "B00004ZETA", "B002NZK5VO", "B0002KPIQY", "B00005JKJA", "B0007V6ITE", "B000FAOC2W", "B00112S8RS", "B0020LH8WU", "B000RGX0EK", "B002DKGWSE", "6305065551", "B002AT8K9W", "B00005JP4N", "0780625528"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003IY498Y", "B00AEFYAC0", "B0029Z8K74", "B000NO39FG"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "asin": "B00005JP97", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5171vu3790L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Black Snake Moan [Theatrical Release]"}

{"description": "First you're hot, then you're not...and then you're Alex Fletcher (HUGH GRANT). So when the sizzlingest tween-queen on the charts asks the has-been '80s pop sensation to write her a song, he grabs for another chance at stardom. Problem: Alex can say it with music, but he sure can't say it with words. Enter Sophie Fisher (DREW BARRYMORE), his beguiling if quirky plant lady, who has a green thumb for lyrics. Together, they go after songwriting success -- and discover that if you want to write the perfect love song, it helps to fall in love. With Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore at the keyboard and Marc Lawrence (Two Weeks Notice) directing, Music and Lyrics is a witty, wacky romantic comedy that faces the music...and laughs!", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00008NRI7", "B00005JPSM", "B0038N9X3Q", "B00006ZXSL", "B004SIP9RO", "B000MQC9H4", "B00005JL7Q", "B000023VTP", "B002ZG988M", "B000CCBCAS", "B000M5B6Q0", "B000ELJAEM", "B0009OL7Z4", "B004SEUJK0", "B00006ZXSO", "B004SIP8JI", "B000YDBPAM", "B000A0GXRO", "B0021L8UZS", "B001WAKOW6", "B00008G7UF", "B00EIBO8T6", "B000BNX3B4", "B003B3V0N4", "B002TQKL7K", "6304765266", "B00006ZXSK", "B00AEBB8YW", "B002K0WBXW", "B0015I2RT8", "B003Y5H574", "B004SIP8LG", "B002ZG97QK", "B002ZG989G", "B00AEBB8NS", "B0001Z3TXE", "B003BV8ICC", "0780625277", "B000HEWEE4", "B00005JLZW", "B00164KYV4", "B00AKGG6JS", "B004SIP9VA", "B0000897EG", "B0011N1WE8", "B002ZFEQ76", "B00AEFYWQY", "B00AEBB9M8", "B001AKTZW8", "B0049TC88U", "B00AEFY99O", "B00008G7UI", "B000RETOGA", "B002OVED88", "B00003CXSM", "B000XJD33O", "B000OCZA04", "B000058TLQ", "B000EMGICS", "B0071HPOGK", "B004LWZW9C", "B004EPZ070", "B002P413IC", "B003EYVXXC", "B002ZG9968", "B00AEFYQE2", "B00006ZXSN", "B000VE4UHO", "B001Y8DJVE", "B003Y5H524", "B0002I84N0", "B00561BNI6", "B0038N9WKU", "B00015YVD6", "B001C5LLQ4", "0783235380", "B004IK30PA", "B00003CXGA", "B005XB8SRS", "B00007E2F5", "B000HCPS94", "6305236569", "B00AEFXYOA", "B000J4QW7W", "B000A343RI", "B00447L4KA", "076784744X", "B0000ARD7O", "B001OQCUZM", "B00AG473GE", "B00015YVI6", "B00006FMUW", "B00DW5ILUG", "B002WEEYIQ", "B00DCG36LO", "B00AEFXWXI", "B0000AOV4I", "B000N4SHOE", "B00005V5NS"], "bought_together": ["B0038N9X3Q"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B008MIMWQC", "B000023VTP", "B0038N9X3Q", "B0021L8UZS"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 13931}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.98, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00005JPE3", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51vp3TIoerL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Music and Lyrics (Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "With harrowing intensity,Alpha Dogdramatizes one of the most tragically notorious murders in recent history. Ripped from the headlines, writer-director Nick Cassavetes' flawed but riveting crime drama (a polar opposite to his previous film, the romantic hitThe Notebook) is based on the real-life case of Jesse James Hollywood, a drug dealer in California's San Gabriel Valley who, in 2000, became one of the youngest men to appear on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted list. Names and details have been changed, but the criminal circumstances remain the same: With family links to organized crime, Johnny Truelove (Emile Hirsch) is on the warpath against Jake Mazursky (Ben Foster), a sleazebag addict who owes him money. Fate intervenes when Johnny and his stoner pals including Frankie (Justin Timberlake) encounter Jake's 15-year-old half-brother Zack (Anton Yelchin) and hold him as collateral until Jake pays his debts. What begins as a casual, seemingly harmless situation escalates into a crisis of capital crime, asAlpha Dogemploys split-screen, docudrama, and mock-documentary interviews to chronicle a tragic tailspin of reckless events and lawless behavior.Cassavetes himself became part of the real-life drama when prosecutors (hoping to locate then-fugitive Jesse James Hollywood, who was captured in 2005) gave him legally controversial access to their case files.Alpha Dogclearly benefits from this inside information, and while the film's grueling depiction of underage squalor (including rampant drug and alcohol abuse) is inevitably off-putting and at least partially exploitative, there's no denying that Cassavetes has worked wonders with a well-chosen ensemble cast including Timberlake, who contrasts his music-industry stardom with a convincing performance as a likable, not-too-bright party animal who quickly gets in over his head. The film is ultimately compromised by Cassavetes' ambitious attempt to cover too much dramatic territory, but like his father John before him, he demonstrates a remarkable skill with actors (including Sharon Stone, Bruce Willis, and Harry Dean Stanton in supporting roles), andAlpha Dogis full of powerful, dangerous moments that aren't easily forgotten.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B004GXKBE2", "B001OXLGJQ", "B001URA5Y8", "B001RTKKS0", "6305127654", "B00004ZETA", "B001DJ7PSC", "0790776960", "B000RGX0EK", "B00006SFJJ", "B0037QGS0A", "B000O77SF4", "B003UAKE9O", "B000ALM4AS", "B00005JH9M", "B0041KYKA6", "B00275EGNS", "B00112S8RS", "B0000A2ZU1", "B007IJKQRS", "B00AEFXJ86", "B000G0O5HS", "B000RO9Q7W", "B00005JMWP", "B004SUDQC2", "B005XB8T68", "0767807588", "B004LWZW7E", "B00AQSN67A", "B00005JKTP", "B005R08HJY", "6305313687", "B000FFL2G6", "0780627806", "B00ET2ODTE", "B00003CXWV", "B0058ZPNBI", "B0009ETCUQ", "B00008972P", "B00005Q4CS", "B001JNNDJM", "B000FKO5QK", "B000BBOUUE", "B00AG51V8E", "B002FU8IWU", "6305428484", "B0043X1FLI", "B00A47BT7C", "B00005V4XW", "6305364206", "B00049QJBG", "B00005U14H", "B000N3AW6G", "6305065551", "B005LAII94", "0790742446", "B00D5VF1SW", "B0007W7I4W", "B002AS466O", "B002PB4I50"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004GXKBE2", "0780627806", "B000ALM4AS", "B00003CXWV"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "asin": "B00005JPK3", "imUrl": "http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-site/icons/no-img-sm._CB192198896_.gif", "title": "Alpha Dog"}
{"description": "Leonardo DiCaprio puts a handsome face on an ugly industry: In parts of Africa, diamond mining fuels civil warfare, killing thousands of innocents and drafting preteen children as vicious soldiers. DiCaprio (The Departed) plays Danny Archer, a white African soldier-turned-diamond-smuggler who gets wind of a large raw jewel found by Solomon Vandy, a native fisherman (Djimon Hounsou,In America) recently escaped from enslavement by a brutal rebel leader. Archer offers a deal: He'll help Vandy find his war-scattered family if Vandy will share the diamond with him. Drawn into this web of exploitation is journalist Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly,Little Children), who agrees to help if Archer will tell her the details of how conflict diamonds make their way into the hands of the corporations who sell them to the Western world. DiCaprio is compelling because he never flinches from Archer's utter ruthlessness; Archer ends up doing the morally justifiable thing, but only because his desperate greed has led him to it. Hounsou and Connelly, though saddled with all the moral and political speeches, rise above the cant and keep the movie's treacherously formulaic plot rooted in human characters. But in the end, the story won't stick with you as much as the dead stillness in the child soldiers' eyes; the horror of African civil strife refuses to be contained byBlood Diamond's uplifting message--and the movie is all the more potent as a result.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001N44BVQ", "B000M341QE", "B00005JLSB", "B00AEBB8NI", "B00080ZG10", "B004SIP7TE", "B006OFN0SE", "B002ZG980U", "B000NIVJF4", "B0007R4T3U", "B0016Q2D66", "B00049QQHI", "B001EZE5DI", "B00003CWM3", "B00008DP4C", "6305268827", "B000BYA5G4", "B00AEBB9F0", "B000Y7WGOW", "B004SIP7ZS", "B000065U1N", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B000095WW8", "B000U7169M", "B00DHHWXYY", "B000GFLKF8", "B004SIP8ZM", "B002O3Z510", "B002VWNIEA", "B002ZG99N6", "B0007DFJ0G", "B005LAIIJY", "0792839137", "B000KP62SE", "B000P0J0EW", "B000P0J09M", "B007SPPANM", "B00004XPPG", "B000C20VPA", "B00011CZRE", "B002QEHPQU", "B00005JN2Z", "B00AEBB9CS", "B00003CXWV", "B00AEFY5B6", "B00001ZWUS", "B00H9KKGTO", "B00005JN0W", "B002T9H2LA", "B000MTEFXC", "B003L20IG0", "B00AEBB86A", "B00005JKBC", "B0013XZ2QK", "B0000ACOXL", "B005LAIGRS", "B002AT8K9W", "B0007KIFGE", "B00AZNEW5G", "B003ASLJO0", "B000T28PII", "B002DU39GW", "B002ZG97RE", "B000LC55F2", "B00003CXTG", "B00AEBBA36", "B00B0U2SFE", "B003ASLJQI", "B002CPMB9O", "B00BB67UNW", "B000MXPE7O", "0783231202", "B000FVQLQQ", "B00AEFXVCU", "B00AEFXRRO", "B000A3XY5A", "B002JCSWV6", "B00005JNQA", "B004EPYZP8", "B0050MB4OO", "B000P0J0AG", "B000C65Z1G", "B00275EGWY", "B00005B6JZ", "B0006GANPA", "B00AEBB9NM", "B002XMGGK6", "B000C20VRS", "B0007P0XBO", "B003UESJME", "B000QXDED6", "B00AHTYI5M", "B001P9KR8U", "B004A8ZX28", "B008JFUNKU", "B003ASLJQS", "B002VWNICC", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00005BCKF", "B000NOIX48"], "bought_together": ["B000M341QE", "B002ZG980U"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AEBB8NI", "B00H9KKGTO", "B008MILL8W", "B000BYA5G4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 106777}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.96, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00005JPGO", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61MN8-6skUL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Blood Diamond (Two-Disc Special Edition)"}

{"description": "One of the first things a viewer notices aboutCloverfieldis that it doesn't play by ordinary storytelling rules, making this intriguing horror film as much a novelty as an event. Told from the vertiginous point-of-view of a camcorder-wielding group of friends,Cloverfieldbegins like a primetime television soap opera about young Manhattanites coping with changes in their personal lives. Rob (Michael Stahl-David) is leaving New York to take an executive job at a company in Japan. At his goodbye party in a crowded loft, Rob&#x92;s brother Jason (Mike Vogel) hands a camcorder to best friend Hud (T.J. Miller), who proceeds to tape the proceedings over old footage of Rob&#x92;s ex-girlfriend, Beth (Odette Yustman)--images shot during happy times in that now-defunct relationship. Naturally, Beth shows up at the party with a new beau, bumming Rob out completely. Just before one's eyes glaze over from all this heartbreaking stuff (captured by Hud, who's something of a doofus, in laughably shaky camerawork), the unexpected happens: New York is suddenly under attack from a Godzilla-like monster stomping through midtown and destroying everything and everybody in sight. Rob and company hit the streets, but rather than run with other evacuees, they head toward the center of the storm so that Rob can rescue an injured Beth. There are casualties along the way, but the journey into fear is fascinating and immediate if emotionally remote--a consequence of seeing these proceedings through the singular, subjective perspective of a camcorder and of a story that intentionally leaves major questions unanswered: Who or what is this monster? Where did it come from? The lack of a backstory, and spare views of the marauding creature, are clever ways by producer J.J. Abrams and director Matt Reeves to keep an audience focused exclusively on what&#x92;s on the screen.  But it also makesCloverfieldcuriously uninvolving. Ultimately,Cloverfield, with its spectacular effects brilliantly woven into a home-video look, is a celebration of infinite possibilities in this age of accessible, digital media.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B004EPYZQ2", "B00IO9D3ZI", "B00EMMDMKM", "B002SJIO5E", "B0044ZOI32", "B001AR0D4A", "B004BZ5AMS", "B001MVYUQQ", "B003BJO8KU", "B0018AG6X6", "B005LAIGPU", "B00IO8VMB6", "B000PKG8SS", "B003Y5H5GU", "B00BPA2PGG", "B0017U7PT6", "B001YV502C", "B0013FBS20", "B008JFUR10", "B001KZVQJI", "B001CW7ZW6", "B0035WTJFW", "B000Y7U98W", "B003ABZGRI", "B000VDDWEC", "B000VDDWEM", "B002JT69IM", "B00164EAC8", "B002ZG981E", "B00AEFXORM", "B001DZOC3W", "B008SAPC20", "B003Y5H59M", "B00HERVMTK", "B00AVSFIV2", "B0032KNA4I", "B000L212HW", "B001FB55I0", "B0018O4YSQ", "B002ZG997M", "B002ZG9788", "B008G33O0G", "B000VDDWE2", "B00K2CHVSK", "B001GCUO5W", "B005J4TLQG", "B000PC6A3E", "B0027VT9ES", "B001F7MSG6", "B0051T46XM", "B00111YM60", "B001GZ6QEC", "B002HR1W1K", "B004SIPA4G", "B001OQCVII", "B001JNNDBA", "B001GKJ2FC", "B000WQWPKA", "B000OT6V00", "B0021L8UXK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004EPYZQ2", "B00IO8VMB6", "B004LWZW4W", "B005LAIHY0"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "asin": "B00005JPXY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Wm5GO98oL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Cloverfield [Theatrical Release]"}
{"description": "You know you're going to get a different kind of superhero when you cast Robert Downey Jr. in the lead role. AndIron Manis different, in welcome ways. Cleverly updated from Marvel Comics' longstanding series,Iron Manputs billionaire industrialist Tony Stark (that's Downey) in the path of some Middle Eastern terrorists; in a brilliantly paced section, Stark invents an indestructible suit that allows him to escape. If the rest of the movie never quite hits that precise rhythm again, it nevertheless offers plenty of pleasure, as the renewed Stark swears off his past as a weapons manufacturer, develops his new Iron Man suit, and puzzles both his business partner (Jeff Bridges in great form) and executive assistant (Gwyneth Paltrow). Director Jon Favreau geeks out in fun ways with the hardware, but never lets it overpower the movie, and there's always a goofy one-liner or a slapstick pratfall around to break the tension. As for Downey, he doesn't get to jitterbug around too much in his improv way, but he brings enough of his unpredictable personality to keep the thing fresh. And listen up, hardcore Marvel mavens: even if you know the Stan Lee cameo is coming, you won't be able to guess it until it's on the screen. It all builds to a splendid final scene, with a concluding line delivery by Downey that just feels absolutely right.--Robert HortonStills fromIron Man(Click for larger image)&nbsp;", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00E5I2M6I", "B008JFUO72", "B001DHXT20", "B00E5I2M9K", "B00E5I2MEK", "B0083SBMBM", "B008JFUS0U", "B001CDR1FG", "B00E5I2MAO", "B004LWZWFQ", "B001GCUO1Q", "B008JFUPFI", "B000VI70QS", "B000HEVZ9E", "B0000959N0", "B00005JKCH", "B00005JNJV", "B00005JNTU", "B0090SI56Y", "B000VR0570", "B00005JMQW", "B002HWRYJE", "B0007P0Y7C", "B004LWZW42", "B00D7OMNXS", "B001OQCV6A", "B007K3JFUQ", "B004EPZ07K", "B004LWZWGA", "B000UR9T8C", "B0083SBJXS", "B0060FXDCG", "B002IPFWTE", "B00E5I2ME0", "B00IXD2MGQ", "B000AYELVA", "B00C6B8TB8", "B008QZ5PY2", "B000OVLBF8", "B000AYELVU", "B00AZMFJYA", "B001QB9H1U", "B009JBWOU0", "B001AK3S4Y", "B001GZ6QC4", "B005G4TJUC", "B002NXSRVG", "B000HCO83Q", "B003YOZNBU", "B003Q6D2B4", "B00023B1LC", "B0002IQMAM", "B008JFURII", "B00HERGM86", "B00E5I2MDQ", "B006VRRGNK", "B002ZG99QS", "B00000JQB5", "B007REV4T8", "B00008G8M5", "B008Y1YK9Y", "B0002ZDVEU", "6305718954", "B001DTPZNY", "B005LAIGW8", "B001F7MSFM", "B001GCUNWQ", "B00A2H9P98", "B000RW3VDE", "B002O5M4T4", "B00005JA8B", "B005LAIIPS", "B005LAII44", "B00BEIYHO2", "B000GUJZ00", "B00005N5S5", "B002SJIO4A", "B000VWYJ86", "B004EPZ0BG", "B0049IHX2C", "B00AEBBAEK", "B00005JM5E", "B008JFUOWM", "B000FS9FCG", "B00005PJ6N", "B00979KQFO", "B00AEFXKUI", "B002K0WBXW", "B0042U94UQ", "B004EPYZUS", "B008JFUQZ2", "B0084IG8TM", "B001DJLD1M", "B008JFUS5A", "B00006HBUJ", "B000J103OI", "B00F84H73Q", "B0087ZG7NO", "B000U1ZV8K"], "bought_together": ["B00E5I2M6I", "B008JFUO72"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B008JFUO72", "B00E5I2M6I", "B001DHXT20", "B00E5I2MEK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 12121}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.99, "brand": "DOWNEY,ROBERT JR.", "asin": "B00005JPS8", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515wjJQt2nL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Iron Man (Ultimate 2 Disc Edition)"}
{"description": "Marriage is a huge step in any relationship and, with the divorce rate skyrocketing, some clergymen find it advisable to council prospective couples prior to the marriage ceremony. Reverend Frank (Robin Williams) takes his marriage preparation course to a whole new level, putting couples through a very unusual and grueling set of classes that cover everything from trust and communication to experiencing childbirth, meeting each other's needs in and out of bed, and group sessions on how to fight fairly. Happy couple Sadie Jones's (Mandy Moore) and Ben Murphy's (John Krasinski) perfect compatibility is tested to the limits with extraordinary (and hysterical) assignments like caring for twin baby robots that cry and poop without restraint while baby-sitting a friend's two young children and shopping for wedding china. Driving a car blindfolded while one's intended gives directions is no simple task either, but abstinence from sex and writing their own marriage vows may be the couple's most difficult homework assignments. Comedy reigns throughout the entire movie thanks to Robin Williams, his choir-boy assistant Josh Flitter (Nancy Drew) and the rest of the cast and laughing out loud is definitely a course requirement for viewers, but underneath the hilarity is a serious message about making marriage work.--Tami HoriuchiDVD featuresIncludes widescreen anamorphic and full-screen versionsAdditional scenes with optional director commentaryAsk Choir Boy: Choose which relationship/marital questions he answers", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00561BNI6", "B000OCZA04", "B000P0J08S", "B00104AYFQ", "B0000CDRVU", "B001TUZD8O", "B00005JN3W", "B000A343RI", "B00008WJD6", "B0015I2RT8", "B0034GK78W", "B002ZG989G", "B00003CXSM", "B001AKTZW8", "B003B3V0N4", "6304584210", "B004EPZ070", "B001BL96JI", "B00AEBB8NS", "B001OQCUZM", "B002ZG9968", "B000LC5B7O", "B00005JPSM", "B000Y7U93C", "B00005JG6N", "B001Y8DJVE", "B008R65XWO", "B003EYVXXC", "B000BKVQS4", "B0009OL7Z4", "B00AEBB9M8", "B000ELJAEM", "B002K0WBXW", "B000ICM5X0", "B000GB775E", "B000RETOGA", "B00005JN4H", "B00006FMUW", "B00386EZKE", "B002ZG97QK", "B00AEFY99O", "B0049TC88U", "B003Y5H524", "B0000DZ6N3", "B000MEYJHE", "B0021L8UOY", "B000E6EHE0", "B0038N9X3Q", "B00007976U", "B00AEFXWXI", "B00008VFCA", "B00005JN0Z", "B0038N9WKU", "B002SYAGNC", "B00007E2F5", "B00DMDE02Q", "B002ZG984Q", "B0015U0QVW", "B0012KJ0DK", "B004IK30PA", "B000YAA68C", "B0002OXRSG", "B002ZG97B0", "B0002I84N0", "B0007RT9M6", "B004SIP9X8", "B000099T4E", "B00006ZXSL", "B001CTA1UM", "B001C5LLQ4", "B000HCPS94", "B00164KYV4", "B000P0J0DS", "B004SIP7I0", "B00005JMXX", "B002ZG998G", "B0000897EG", "B000J4QW7W", "B00466HN7M", "B00AEBB8R4", "B003Y5H4ZW", "B002ZG98FU", "B005LAIIB2", "B000957O82", "B003UEYBPI", "B000EMGICS", "B00AEFYWQY", "B00029LO5E", "B002ZGW92E", "B0026BXHQ0", "B000VKL6T8", "B00HW3EZZE", "B005LAIGSM", "B000LC4Z8A", "B0010X5X4O", "B002ZG99UE", "B000E8N8H0", "B002U4UYZA", "B001HN69C2", "B004HO6I2E"], "bought_together": ["B000OCZA04"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0034GK78W", "B002ZG989G", "B00561BNI6", "B001Y8DJVE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 56082}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.99, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00005JPQE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51-wgdGowCL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "License to Wed"}

{"description": "Each of the snazzy 25-minute installments from the most popular Japanese animated TV series of 1998 is a satisfying adventure tale about a futuristic hipster bounty hunter. This is an elegant action-comedy anime, with smoothly integrated CGI space-flight elements, gorgeous graphics, blues harmonica and sax riffs on the soundtrack, and a no-sweat post-Tarantino attitude. Despite occasional eruptions of gun-fu Asian-action violence, and some intimations of heavy-duty drug use (in the first of 26 episodes, one especially noxious narcotic is administered as an aerosol spray straight onto the user's eyeballs), the tone is surprisingly convivial. None of the generic tough elements are grim or mean-spirited. Lanky antihero Spike Spiegel is a planet-hopping freelance hunter with an ex-cop sidekick named Jet, a loopy fellow hunter named Faye, a teenage computer hack, and a genetically enhanced Welsh corgi assistant in tow. The emphasis is on clever twists of plot in an episodic short-story format with as many wisecracks as punches being thrown.--David Chute", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AUJH32E", "B00441GYS8", "B004R0MF0M", "B0049TC8AI", "B00102FF7U", "B004DMIISM", "B007V9ECYI", "B005HVWWB2", "B000CEV3O6", "B008KHJJ9I", "B00CDV4OR4", "B00ENNBZ68", "B003W5TO70", "B005W2BWLC", "B008NNY9YE", "B008YRL7JE", "B00BQ1DDUG", "B00B1RB942", "B00CSYR432"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00102FF7U", "B00441GYS8", "B0049TC8AI", "B00AUJH32E"]}, "price": 53.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 133405}, "asin": "B00005QCW4", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51VANY80R6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Cowboy Bebop - The Perfect Sessions (Limited Edition Complete Series Boxed Set)"}

{"description": "By the winter of 1942, Hitler's dream of Aryan supremacy had become a nightmare.  His armies could be found freezing and starving on the Eastern front, and America's fighting forces had just entered the war to the West. On January 20th of that year, 15 officials attended a conference at Wannsee on the outskirts of Berlin.  Comprised of mid-ranking SS commanders and a variety of government ministers, the meeting was organized by SS Major Adolf Eichmann, under the direction of the ruthless and efficient Chief of Security Reinhard Heydrich.  It was to be a polite conference with food, wine and some debate, but beneath this thin veneer of manners lay an evil intent.  By the meeting's close, the fate of six million lives would be decided, and a terrible machine put into operation that would alter the shape of the world.Conspiracyis based on the only surviving record of that meeting.

{"description": "Ranked by critics as one of Germany&#x92;s most important films,The Murderers Are Among Usoffers a wrenching look at history and humanity. The first feature film produced in Germany after World War II, it is set in Berlin just after the surrender, and the city is still being battered by air raids. The characters move through the half-destroyed husks of old buildings, and even simple acts like serving a meal at a table take on new meaning as the people try to put their lives back together. Susanne Wallner is a concentration camp survivor, eager to taste life again after her living death. Dr. Hans Mertens is a former German officer, unable to live with the guilt of what he and his former comrades have done. The two must quite literally learn to live side by side as they come to terms with the past and start to look toward the future. The film is beautifully and sensitively made, and possesses a shining optimism that is surprising for its time.--Ali Davis", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000JU7KCW", "B0013B34XA", "B000274THQ", "B00065GX64", "B0017ZGYR0", "B000021Y77", "B000E6ESS0", "B000GRU8TK", "B002KECJZ8", "B002IVDLGY", "B0030Y1282", "B000063UQT", "6305972761", "B000OVLBGC", "B0006IIKRQ", "1571134689", "B0040QYROA", "B002CS5NW8", "B0001VO38S", "B009XTF8NI", "B0009VND0E", "B0010YSDB8", "B00ID8H8EW", "B0009RCPUC", "B000U95NAI", "B000U95N9Y", "B0000646UM", "B00BSTVGHS", "0767802470", "B000093NQY", "B005HP2IYE", "B002BWP4A6", "B00GMV8B1G", "B00CVB6UXW", "B00006JMQG", "B002ZG8PXQ", "B008EXG6QC", "B0045ZAQSM", "B001DB6J82", "B00005QW59", "B00007L4I7", "6305301697", "B000JLIYRQ", "B000HD1MW0", "B0000WN10O", "B000BKVROM", "B002LFPBJW", "B00000F5KH", "0415420989", "B0006SJ3IQ", "B000H5V8H2", "B00EO2I6XS", "B0001FVDSM", "B0012QE4PI", "B000FVGNSM", "B002U6DVQ2", "B0007NMKVM", "B00HLSSC7M", "B000093NQZ", "B0049TC8CQ", "B006FE83T0", "B001KW90L2", "B002WBYDR6", "B008I34ZMA", "B000YKT4BW", "B005ARYF1S", "B0070YPWAW", "B000RXZIJS", "B00008978K", "B005HQBO9I", "B000P46QTA", "B0001US78G", "B00007CVS3", "B00792DYYQ", "B002EBRFA6", "1465400478", "B00IBKXS2I", "B00C2535TE", "B00I095JAY", "B000EZ9066", "6305081034", "0547863381", "B0063E00GQ", "B00005YUO1", "B001TH06TI", "B003BR8MEA", "B0007NMKVC", "0143039881", "B00AMHFO5C", "B0019Z3P66", "B0016AU882", "0814325602", "B0009WIE8Y", "B000G8P240", "B001DDBDIG", "B008I34YY4", "B0052WNHRY", "B000IHYXSU", "6304279388"], "bought_together": ["B000JU7KCW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000JU7KCW", "B004S2O8Z4", "B000E6ESS0", "B00699G65E"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 71113}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 21.13, "brand": "", "asin": "B000063UQS", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51S9D508HKL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Murderers Are Among Us"}

{"description": "MGM is grouping episodes from the newOuter Limitsanthology series by theme rather than chronology for DVD, and this first collection compiles six episodes that focus on matters of the heart (and other body parts).

This reworking of the 1963-1965 science fiction series is competent but lacks the palpable suspense of the original series. Also, there's no sense of new ground being broken with its stories; the original series took risks with its parables on war (\"Soldier\") and technology (\"O.B.I.T.\").

{"description": "The DVD set of theBack to the Futuretrilogy is as classy and  professional as the series. Both new and original materials are included in the  plethora of extras, starting with two sets of making-of documentaries. Each disc  has material on that particular film, and some features look at the trilogy as a  whole. Producer-writer Bob Gale is the star of the extra features, candidly  presenting the original ideas and many deleted scenes (a few with doses of crude  humor). Much of the inside stuff is repeated in the various pieces, but that's  to be expected with such exhaustive materials. Michael J. Fox chimes in with a  video commentary presented in a picture-in-picture format (which would have  worked better as a straight interview) and the producers tackle the main  commentary track, but the highlight audio commentary is a free-flowing Q&A; with  Gale and director Robert Zemeckis in front of a USC film-school audience. Long  or short, the materials are uniformly enjoyable and deft, including segments on  advertising, special effects tests, on-screen anecdotes, outtakes, production  designs, and more.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001E75QH0", "B0009RCPY8", "B0057RCFQS", "B000P0J09W", "B001CCSI2W", "B00003CXC5", "B0087F7VSY", "B00003CXC3", "B001AGXEAG", "B00DQC2FPM", "B000FO0AA6", "B00AEFXXMI", "B00HZMZ2FE", "B000065V42", "B006VRRGNK", "B000E33W26", "B000FO0A9W", "B00008G8LM", "B00IZZDWKM", "B001AEF6C2", "B00003CXCT", "B00CNW9ZI6", "B0006OBPTA", "B00007AJGH", "6305428050", "B0001I562I", "B008X905AK", "B000FS9UKI", "B0008JIJ2E", "B000YGDNPO", "0800141601", "B00AEFY0F2", "0792844890", "B00003CX5P", "B00HFFE8HE", "B0084IHVUC", "B0002WZTOI", "B00ALTQRRK", "0783225547", "B000MGBLTQ", "B0087ZG7HK", "B001DJLD2G", "B001QB9H10", "B0015NORDW", "B000P0J06U", "B009JBWOU0", "B00028HBES", "B000OVLBF8", "B002I9Z8I0", "B003UESJF6", "B00AEFXDO6", "0783231644", "B0000VCZKM", "B0000VCZK2", "B0014Z4OMU", "B00005T7HZ", "B000274T94", "B00006HBUJ", "B0060FXDCG", "B00005JNTU", "B00005JLXH", "B008H6GHEM", "B000QQLVPQ", "B006U1JD5G", "B0001Z3TXE", "B000ASATYY", "B000JYW5BE", "B00000JPH6", "B00005TN8K", "B00005PJ6N", "B000Y11B7Q", "B00008G8M5", "B007SPPANM", "B0012RWQJ8", "B0019HQICW", "B000BPL2GK", "B00005JPD0", "B00AGKHBQK", "B00006ZXSL", "0800177991", "B0067EKYAY"], "bought_together": ["B001E75QH0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001LXIDVI", "B008JFUPFI", "B009JBWOU0", "B0057RCFQS"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 65851}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 34.5, "brand": "MCA", "asin": "B00006AL1D", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51CRSVV0WEL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)"}
{"description": "Nine Queensjoins a line of sly thrillers about master-pupil con artists and games within games within games that includesThe Sting,House of Games, andHeist. In the first five minutes, we watch an overt scam--a young Argentinian named Juan (Gast&#xF3;n Pauls) running the two-10s-for-a-5 hornswoggle on a convenience store clerk--then find that we have been tricked along with the bystanders as another brand of deception kicks in. And so it goes as Juan, with both trepidation and excitement, drifts into partnership for a day with an older, more cosmopolitan conman, Marcos (Ricardo Dar&#xED;n).  Knocking around Buenos Aires--from gritty downtown to cozy neighborhood side streets to a swank hotel where wealth murmurs behind every door--these damnably resourceful scoundrels try not to miss a bet, including an epic swindle involving the titular \"Nine Queens,\" a set of ultrarare stamps. Writer-director Fabi&#xE1;n Bielinsky keeps a taut rein on everything, including his own cleverness. The end result is an entertainment as bracingly disciplined as it is ingenious.--Richard T.

The story picks up several years later as Elijah (now played by A Tribe Called Quest's Q-Tip) is accepted to college, but ends up in prison after accidentally killing another group home resident (rapper Fat Joe).Prison Songwas cowritten and produced by Q-Tip and Darnell Martin (I Like It Like That) and plays like an extended episode ofOz(in which Perrineau played a key role). Blige's \"Mom's Song\" is the musical highlight, and Elvis Costello appears as Elijah's teacher and lawyer, but does not sing.--Kathleen C.

{"description": "Trouble in Paradiseis the supreme example of \"the Lubitsch touch,\" that mastery of comic timing, diamond-cutter precision, and Continental sophistication that made Ernst Lubitsch a household name and the real star of every movie he directed. A pair of prodigiously talented, utterly charming scoundrels (Herbert Marshall, Miriam Hopkins) become personal assistants to an aristocratic Parisian widow (Kay Francis). Their target is her fortune, but she's such an elegant lady, and so agreeably smitten with her new right-hand man, that he's tempted to pursue a secondary objective. Marshall, Hopkins, and Francis aren't remembered as major stars, but in this enchanted moment they are sublime. Likewise the peerlessly pixilated Edward Everett Horton and Charlie Ruggles as the widow's stuffed-shirt suitors.Trouble in Paradiseis one of the best comedies ever made.

Yamcha is held at the mercy of the ruthless Android 20, and Goku and the others must race to help their friend.

And Android 19 isn&#x92;t showing any signs of slowing down!   Attacked from within by a crippling virus, Goku is helpless against the maniacal Android 19.

The first commentary track is a combination of informative but subdued remarks by director Clark Johnson spliced with a track by Samuel L. Jackson and five other actors (but not Colin Farrell) together.  The comments by the actors are infrequent, raucous, and forgettable. There's also a commentary track by four of the writers, who discuss how they were writingS.W.A.T.when the North Hollywood shootout (on which the opening scene is based) took place, and what writers think about actors who improvise. The making-of featurette gives plenty of exposure and credit to the real-life S.W.A.T. officers who helped with the film, and a featurette on the original TV series is interesting, even though it's basically an advertisement for theDVD set.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004H2P6II", "B00005JLX2", "B0015LPRZQ", "B0025KVKDO", "B00005JLQN", "B0001XAQ9Q", "B00005JL3K", "B000J4QWMC", "B000A2X3MU", "B002ZG99N6", "B00275EGWY", "B000FJGR76", "B002AT8K9W", "B000KX0HFK", "B00AEBB86A", "B004LGGXG4", "B001MZ5W3M", "B000G5SILC", "B001BP4K22", "B00004Z1FX", "B000QUCRB4", "B000HC2M2K", "6304806434", "B00003CXNY", "B000TJBN80", "B000KLQUSU", "0790736411", "B00HLTD3ZW", "1558908315", "B000VG66XS", "B00016MSV2", "B002ZG994U", "B004V8W52S", "B008E70EES", "B000065U1N", "B000X1Z0C4", "B0000VJG72", "B00004Z4WR", "B0007W7I4W", "0767803434", "B0010YVCB6", "B00005JKTP", "B0034G4OUO", "B00005QW6V", "6304698747", "B000K7UBSO", "B000FFL2G6", "B000F8DV1M", "B004EPYZUS", "B000274T94", "B00004STUL", "B002VWNIEA", "B000095WW8", "B00000FZL2", "B00ECXJBN8", "B0000B1OFL", "B00AEFY0XE", "B00562I40K", "0792835727", "B0009KA7XG", "B000BTITKS", "B000KGGIZK", "B00009ZPUA", "B0002IQMAM", "B0058ZPNBI", "B005LAIIPS", "B001QB9H10", "B001O5LVVC", "B001UV4XGA", "B004HO6HWA", "B00BUC4TJ0", "B00BEIYHO2", "B004P3ENLA", "B0006GANOQ", "B0019EXZY4", "B00000G3PA", "B0013J55B6", "B002GHHHL0", "B00004STDN", "B0009DWL8W", "6304711891", "B0034G4ORC", "B003Y5H5FG", "B00BB67UNW", "B001ILHY1I", "B004EPYZQC", "B002AT8KA6", "0790732149", "B00260HH2G", "B000CQLZ8S", "B005LAIH2C", "B002ZG97RE", "B003M987QK", "B000A0GP0Y", "B000KX0HIW", "B00009L1TA", "B00005V9I6", "0783240295", "B000P0J0BK", "B0000542CK"], "bought_together": ["B004H2P6II"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00008YLVB", "B000M341QE", "B005CFBYW6", "B003Q6D2B4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 24979}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.98, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B00008EYA5", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51BEAR8WT7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "S.W.A.T.

{"description": "Kate Hudson twinkles as the heroine of How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days. She's a magazine writer assigned to date a guy, make all the mistakes girls make that drive guys away (being clingy, talking in baby-talk and so on) and records the process like a sociological experiment. However, the guy she picks-- Matthew McConaughey--is an advertising executive who's just bet that he can make a woman fall in love with him in 10 days; if he succeeds, he'll win a huge account that will make his career. The set-up is completely absurd, but the collision of their efforts to woo and repel creates some pretty funny scenes. McConaughey's easy charm and Hudson's lightweight impishness play well together and the plot, though strictly Hollywood formula, chugs along efficiently. At moments Hudson seems to channel her mother, Goldie Hawn, to slightly unnerving effect. --Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00007E2F5", "B00003CXSM", "B00AEFXWXI", "B0012KJ0DK", "B002K0WBXW", "B0015I2RT8", "B00164KYV4", "B004EPZ070", "B0000897EG", "B00447L4KA", "B002P413IC", "B00005JN3W", "B002ZG988M", "B000MQC9H4", "B002ZG989G", "B00AEBB8NS", "B000A343RI", "B001TUZD8O", "B00006ZXSL", "B00005O5CM", "B001OQCUZM", "B004EPZ0BG", "B00081U7HC", "B004SIP9X8", "B003Y5H574", "B001Y8DJVE", "6304765266", "B00008NRI7", "B000YDBPAM", "B0038N9X3Q", "B00AEBB8R4", "B00AEFYQE2", "B000683VI4", "B0000524E5", "B00AEBB9WI", "B00AEFXO8Q", "B00AEFYM2S", "B000YAA68C", "B00AMEZDJW", "B0007PLLBU", "B00006ZXSK", "B002ZG984Q", "B0009OL7Z4", "B002ZG9968", "B0036TGSIK", "B000023VTP", "B003BV8ICC", "B00AEFYWQY", "B00AEBB8YW", "B000J4QW7W", "B003B3V0N4", "B00005JG6N", "B0000DIXDR", "B004SEUJK0", "B005LAIGSM", "B000ELJAEM", "B0001Z3TXE", "B000957O82", "B001OQCUYI", "B004SIP9RO", "B004SIP8LG", "B003NHRIVQ", "B0013D8LHC", "B00AKGG6JS", "B00008WJD6", "B003Y5H524", "B000J103OI", "B0050MB584", "B00006ZXSO", "B00006FMUW", "B000HEWEE4", "6305236569", "B000XJD33O", "B002ZG99UE", "B0035Q637K", "B00466HN7M", "B001L9EXTS", "B00386EZKE", "B001C5LLQ4", "076780421X", "B000J3OTSM", "B000E6EHE0", "B004LWZW9C", "B00005JM55", "B000EMGICS", "B000CEV3KU", "B008JFUUIA", "B00003CXMP", "B000P0J0DS", "B000TZJBPQ", "B0000AOV4I", "B005Z9MFRC", "B0000D8L1K", "B000HCPS94", "B00E8RKHWW", "B00AEFY4CG", "B004SIP8JI", "B0001AVZA8", "B005LAIGXW", "B000Y7U93C"], "bought_together": ["B00007E2F5", "B002K0WBXW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002K0WBXW", "B002ZG989G", "B00007E2F5", "B00447L4KA"]}, "price": 14.16, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 346003}, "asin": "B00008KDGZ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/512083xZEbL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days"}

{"description": "Jake Busey steps into Rutger Hauer's cowboy boots to remind viewers about the dangers of picking up hitchhikers in this sequel to the 1986 thriller. Though suggested, it's unclear whether Busey's black-clad hitcher is actually supposed to be Hauer, who blackmailed teen driver Jim (C. Thomas Howell) for a series of killing 17 years earlier, but he makes life miserable all the same for the grown Jim (Howell again), now an trauma-plagued cop, and his girlfriend (Kari Wuhrer) as they drive through Texas (played here by Canada, and well photographed by George Mooradian). But where the originalHitcherwas a taut exercise in suspense, executive producer Charles Meeker's script is simply a retread of its predecessor's highlights, including the infamous \"drawn and quartered\" scene, and gives the three leads little to do. Busey tries hard, but lacks Hauer's formidable presence, which may disappoint fans of the original; undemanding frightfest aficionados might enjoy this best.--Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00CDV4RS0", "B000NO3DLG", "B00JF5GAIW", "B000AM4P9K", "B001DZOC64", "B000063UR5", "B001KEHAEO", "B004EI2NP4", "B0002O7XW2", "B008G4T7W4", "6305120021", "B00CERJI5U", "B00DMUFXOS", "B000Q66Q8I", "B002JT69OG", "B0013LL2YS", "B008JFUNYG", "B0013527K2", "B001AV3BWM", "B00CPN933U", "B00BCMT2BI", "B000I2J68M", "B000G1ALDY", "B005CFBZQ6", "B000ARFPMQ", "B004A2AN5G", "B000K7UC2Y", "B000WC389G", "B00018D42W", "B000XUUQQK", "B00DMUFYZQ", "B00CAATSME", "B000KJU1KK", "B0007WFXL2", "B00ESZZOLI", "B000JLQQ94", "B008DL4LN0", "B00A429Y9M", "B00030AZCK", "B000PMFRYC", "B0002Y4T7O", "B000QQJ3Q0", "157362408X", "B00DOZNGC2", "B0002B14UW", "B00AEFYDM2", "B0001FGBWK", "B00E0FW07W", "B009IV2Z7S", "B0000AZT78", "0783223609", "B007CZ3E7C", "B0052DP1RC", "B00D3LA6M0", "B002E2QH7W", "B001L9EXUC", "B005GT3X68", "B0006Z2LH4", "B00111YM56", "B00068WOH8", "B00275EHFU", "B003ZZ7TPG", "B001AIQ14A", "B002ZG99IG", "B000TGJ80S", "B0001VTPWC", "B0001VTPW2", "B0021L8UXK", "B00AEFXKZ8", "B004XIWRW4", "B000H1RFXM", "B000FA57U8", "B000063UR3", "B000FS9FEY", "B0002S9QUA", "B000IMUYJM", "B00B04NJE4", "B0001ZX088", "B001DJLD0S", "B00008DDVY", "B00002CGG2", "B002LMSWN2", "B001D2WU9I", "B001KEHAE4", "B009IV2Z3M", "B000RGN2JI", "0790739313", "6305238065", "B004AC6PMG", "B001NPD9LS", "B002ZG983M", "B001DJLD1W", "B009AMALGM", "079284646X", "B0000C2IWM", "B0031U8OEK", "B00BEIYGT8", "B00BLF9FOK", "B004SEUJPA", "B002OPZ2UC"], "bought_together": ["B00CDV4RS0", "B000NO3DLG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00CDV4RS0", "B000NO3DLG", "B001DZOC64", "B00006JU6Z"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 195600}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.39, "brand": "Universal Studios", "asin": "B00009LIA5", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516NSYZ775L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Hitcher II: I've Been Waiting"}

{"description": "Set in 1913 England, on the brink of what would be the war to end all wars, the British film classicThe Shooting Partyfocuses on an assortment of upper-crust acquaintances who gather for a weekend of hunting and society niceties (billiards, cards, draping oneself in jewels the evening after stomping around all day in the muck). Presiding over the festivities is a masterful James Mason as Sir Randolph Nettleby, a sort of benevolent dictator of his breathtaking estate, as his family and friends dip in and out of the action, adhering to the strict code of class conduct for all of their affairs--sport, self-advancement, illicit love. Though the weekend is supposed to be a holiday, there is subtle, ominous foreshadowing in the very first scenes, of the men lined up in a meadow, as though troops on a battlefield, taking out ducks and hares with an almost dispassionate relish. Mason as Nettleby has rarely been better--crisp, bemused, comfortable in his role but not quite in his own skin. The score by John Scott is transportative.

{"description": "As high school comedies for young viewers go,Saved by the Bellis as light as they come, yet there is something unusually addictive about it. No doubt that's because the series, set at Bayside High School in Pacific Palisades, California, balances fluffy stories with evolving relationships. It's no chore to watch every episode in thisSaved by the Bell: Seasons 1 & 2boxed set and feel satisfied with the touching, admirable growth and affection between key characters.The show concerns teenager Zack Morris (Mark Paul Gosselaar) and his eclectic group of friends. Zack himself is a complicated fellow: he's a vain hound for the girls and a screw-up who sets attendance records for detention. But as the series progresses, he also demonstrates that he's a thoughtful kid, underneath it all, with insight and loyalty to others. Tiffani-Amber Thiessen plays Kelly Kapowski, a cheerleader and mall rat who gains seriousness of purpose and dignity over time, and who ends a rivalry between Zack and good-natured sexist jock A.C. Slater (Mario Lopez) by choosing the former--after he cleans up his act a bit. Jessie Murtle Spano (Elizabeth Berkley) may be the most interesting character: smart and given to alternative-lifestyle values, an unabashed feminist yet self-conscious about her height. (She towers over most boys interested in her). Samuel \"Screech\" Powers (Dustin Diamond) is the show's token nerd, but he defies the stereotype in many ways: In \"Dancing to the Max,\" Kelly develops a crush on Screech after he tutors her in science, while in other episodes he wins a beauty contest and comes to the heroic aid of a chum more than once. What's nice aboutSaved by the Bellis the way these sundry friends all get to know and accept each other, creating unexpected bonds and encouraging honest support when the chips are down. Highlights include \"The Election,\" in which Zack, typically, runs for class president against Jessie on a lark, then has to face real responsibility when he wins. In \"The Prom,\" Kelly gives up her dream of attending the school prom after her dad loses his job; she's rewarded with Zack's own sacrifice to make sure she's not alone.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0001EFV9K", "B0009KQP96", "B000QUEQ4A", "B003SNJO5S", "B003SNJXMC", "B0002EJ7JY", "B00LBHOCHS", "B003SNJY1C", "B004MPRNAE", "B000C6NPHC", "B000EQ45BU", "B0006N2F0E", "B000EU1QC2", "B00005JO2V", "B004WO9OS4", "B000AYEIFY", "B0072BNKHA", "B0053O8AFK", "B0002DB5N6", "B0001Z3I1C", "B0044LYRFA", "B000FQIRWC", "B000777HYS", "B000H7JCG4", "B00465I1D8", "B0002JZT5U", "B00008AOX3", "B00CPEI0A6", "B000BC8T1O", "B0002W4SWW", "B00B1LM76M", "B0006Z2L4W", "B000KLQUMG", "B0006L0LKW", "B000E1MXVO", "B000BB1MIW", "B002B2Z9G0", "B005XLFB32", "B000CELOVI", "B001JAHSAK", "B009X919YU", "B000CELOW2", "076244326X", "B000MGBSHQ", "B005G4FFBE", "B0009S2KC4", "B000IJ79VG", "B004GJYR82", "B001NY4X3W", "B000OVLBH6", "B001GP5TMW", "B00IYJHAUC", "B00J2R3W2K", "B0007US79Y", "B001AXU1DC", "B001JAHSAA", "B0058J3S16", "B000K7UBXE", "B0006J28E6", "B007C8RZYC", "B000PY52CW", "B000SQFC0O", "B000VDDE0E", "B008L0YMUK", "B001CQONOK", "B0038Q9Q94", "B000GB5M4M", "B0013SIVLS", "B000U1ZV4E", "B000929AV4", "B0006N2EZU", "B0002I838Q", "B0015XWU9A", "B000UAE7MC", "B000EYK4H6", "B000FL7C8W", "B000B5XOUM", "B000LV6O12", "B000H7JCGE", "B0006IUE16", "B000CCBCCQ", "B00B58FVBY", "B000CCBCHQ", "B0017VG690", "B00CVB6XDO", "B0001IN0T4", "B0009I7NH6", "B000Q6774U", "B000PGTPGO", "B000A59PM4", "B00005JPII", "B000Y7U9AK", "B0058JEI06", "B00GOC75YW", "B0015I2S74", "B000EWBKP8", "B0007Y08LK", "B00005JNIS", "B0009W5J4Q", "B000B8384G"], "bought_together": ["B0001EFV9K", "B0009KQP96"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000QUEQ4A", "B00ELKDDWM", "B0001EFV9K", "B001GFAMP6"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 34660}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 12.22, "brand": "Berkley", "asin": "B0000AKY3Q", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51BJ45PWN4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Saved by the Bell - Seasons 1 &amp; 2"}

{"description": "The fifthPok&#xE9;monmovie takes Ash, Misty, Brock, and Pikachu to the  city of Altomare, a thinly disguised Venice guarded by the shape-shifting Pok&#xE9;mon  Latios and Latias. Two new agents of Giovanni's, Annie and Oakley, are out to  capture these rare Pok&#xE9;mon--reducing Team Rocket to the role of spectators.  Latios and Latias are linked to an elaborate, computer-generated mechanism that  defends the city, controls the tides and brings fossil Pok&#xE9;mon back to life.  Ash and Pikachu foil the evil plan with some help from Misty, Brock, and  Bianca, a girl who lives in Altomare with her kindly grandfather. The contrived  story suggests that as far as features are concerned, thePok&#xE9;monfranchise  has pretty much run dry. (The film earned less than $1 million in its U.S.  theatrical release.)

{"description": "When Mary Rodgers, daughter of the composer Richard Rodgers, was reported as saying she never wanted to see anotherOklahoma!, it was her way of paying the highest tribute to Trevor Nunn's production at the Royal National Theatre which was subsequently taken into the studio and filmed. The camera follows the playgoers into the auditorium of the Olivier where in their company we watch the show and applaud thenumbersas the real thing. Nunn treats Rodgers and Hammerstein's first collaboration with the utmost seriousness, restoring the full text so that it comes across as a drama indebted to Eugene O'Neill. AlthoughOklahoma!unfolds at a leisurely pace, it is extraordinary how one is drawn into the drama under Nunn's direction.There's seldom a wish for true locations as the pace picks up and we move into the claustrophobic company of Judd Fry in his riveting encounter with the cowboy Curly. The close-up camera work affords an experience the theatre can't bring and also pays handsome dividends in appreciating Susan Stroman's intricate and lively choreography. Her dancers are a fine team, notably Jimmy Johnston who is outstanding as Will Parker leading the Kansas City ensemble. Hugh Jackman (X-Men) as Curly matches him in vocal prowess and looks, and Shuler Hensley sings the tricky role of Judd Fry very well. It's harder to place Peter Polycarpou's Pedlar, a considerably larger role than in thefilm version, whose accent strays from London's East End to the plains of Europe. Maureen Lipman, rightly deemed the lynchpin of the musical by Nunn, is a joy to watch as Aunt Eller. Laurey (Josefina Gabrielle) and Ado Annie (Vicki Simon) are good but not special. Aside from an abrupt start to Act Two and the occasional voice off microphone, the production sounds good with a larger orchestra present than in the theatre. AnOklahoma!on an epic scale.--Adrian Edwards", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000CEV4ZO", "B0000DJZ7T", "B000NTM9ZM", "6305320802", "B008SBXFUU", "B00001PE59", "B0013Z7RUC", "630530209X", "B000FIHNHK", "B00004XMTJ", "B000I2J6YG", "B00BX8PG3Y", "B001LMAKAG", "B00004RFEZ", "B0060QSGJ0", "B0007WFXZI", "B005S9EK5Y", "B00002EPLJ", "B000BITUNE", "B00004W5VC", "B000ATQYVK", "B004SIP8JI", "B0000AM6IY", "B001CC7PLM", "1423490568", "B002HK9IDQ", "0783240287", "B001PO550A", "B0014IC31G", "B000HT3PGK", "B005SFR7YE", "B00006ZXSO", "B00FWMVVLS", "B000649YA2", "B00068NVG6", "B005NFJAZS", "B000093NR3", "B0002S94IY", "B0074B2NC6", "B004I2K4DY", "B000UAE7NG", "B000RPCK2E", "B00005KAQS", "B000HT3PGU", "B00005A7XB", "B00005JL1P", "B00BDSRB2S", "B000VKL6RK", "B000JJSKZ4", "B000BT970O", "B00J2T18EW", "B0000BWVMQ", "B000IU37SO", "B007P7UF0G", "B0000BZNDK", "B001PPGAIA", "B00IBQ5M1W", "B00006RCMW", "B00KRFE9UK", "B00005LIN0", "0767827651", "B0028SVXVM", "B00JM5CAHA", "B006GHA9QQ", "B000NO1SRW", "1844549046", "B004K4FUWA", "B000JGWD32", "B004KOW2HQ", "B002D0L0R2", "B0090XLDKY", "B000KN7BSG", "B00079HZTS", "B0034G4P30", "B008E16LS2", "B00005JPAR", "B000LC55F2", "B0007939NO", "B00005JM6A", "B000EBD9SA", "B000O76ZR6", "B000E0ODZY", "B00143XE1E", "B00KO76FSA", "076781326X", "B00JAOW3MA", "B009NYF2GQ", "B000059PQI", "B00B04NJ2G", "0306809435", "B00AATV0WS", "B000KP62J8", "B00FN3HRG4", "B00DVH20MA", "B00005JLIU", "B00005OCMS", "0415404398", "B0007TKNII", "B000056KE9", "B002NZK5TG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["6305320802", "B00004Y3OC", "B000HT3PGU", "B002HK9IDQ"]}, "price": 64.96, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 25516}, "asin": "B0000C23HY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51H92WSNE4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Rodgers and Hammerstein's Oklahoma!

{"description": "The sixth season ofBuffy the Vampire Slayerfollowed the logic of plot and character development into some gloomy places. The year begins with Buffy being raised from the dead by the friends who miss her, but who fail to understand that a sacrifice taken back is a sacrifice negated. Dragged out of what she believes to have been heavenly bliss, she finds herself \"going through the motions\" and entering into a relationship with the evil, besotted vampire Spike just to force her emotions.  Willow becomes ever more caught up in the temptations of magic; Xander and Anya move towards marriage without ever discussing their reservations; Giles feels he is standing in the way of Buffy's adult independence; Dawn feels neglected. What none of them need is a menace that is, at this point, simply annoying--three high school contemporaries who have turned their hand to magical and high-tech villainy. Added to this is a hungry ghost, an invisibility ray, an amnesia spell and a song-and-dance demon (who acts as rationale for the incomparable musical episode \"Once More, with Feeling\").This is a year in which chickens come home to roost: everything from the villainy of the three geeks to Xander's doubts about marriage come to a head, often--as in the case of the impressive wedding episode--through wildly dark humor. The estrangement of the characters from each other--a well-observed portrait of what happens to college pals in their early 20s--comes to a shocking head with the death of a major character and that death's apocalyptic consequences. The series ends on a consoling note which it has, by that point and in spite of imperfections, entirely earned.--Roz Kaveney", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000EHSVN2", "B000EHSVM8", "B000EHSVLY", "B000EHSVLE", "B000EHSVL4", "B000EHSVKK", "B000I0QLRI", "B000I0QLRS", "B000I0QLS2", "B000I0QLQY", "B000I0QLR8", "B007H9CNOI", "B000HD1482", "B003YF9Q08", "1593078226", "B00006J3WH", "B0006IUE16", "B0009W5J4Q", "B002JVWR4U", "B000ERVJM2", "B000GG4Y6O", "B000JLTRIG", "B000CCBCGM", "1595825584", "1595826106", "B000B5XOW0", "B00001R3O1", "B0024FAR66", "B001FB4W0C", "B00AMDA2QC", "1595821651", "B005CM1IIE", "B000OIOPHC", "B006LG74Q0", "B00JF5G8WU", "159307963X", "B00344EAQO", "B0000AQS0F", "B00466H3CW", "B002U8XW9Q", "B000X5SPBI", "1595824154", "B000BOH990", "B000BOH98G", "1595823425", "B00133QNSG", "B003R4ZMN6", "B00511N79O", "B000O77SN6", "B008EVT42W", "B000BOH986", "B000CNE0SS", "B009LDCXNY", "B0002XVKMM", "B000RO6JYK", "B00076ONT6", "B009LDCWWG", "B00IWTVDUW", "B000FP2OPY", "B006LG74RE", "B000R7GKQE", "B0010YSD7M", "B00243FQFA", "B000O77SMW", "1442412097", "B003R0MF7G", "B002JVWRAO", "B009LDD4V4", "B001MVWRNO", "B001AQO43M", "0789326302", "B000JW1TYU", "B000AO9BSS", "1595823107", "B004YM6JLO", "B0000C9JFQ", "B0006J28E6", "B001RXDM2C", "B000EXDS3E", "B005PPMHO2", "B00466H3CC", "B0058YPGL6", "B00133QNS6", "B00006FD9N", "B001992NWO", "B0001O3YLM", "1595829229", "B00A8KJN8M", "B003L77GAQ", "B00133QNRW", "B00005JNOG", "B001MVWRNE", "B00AMDA2P8", "B00HEQOAIQ", "B000G1R4TS", "B0077PTWHI", "B001QE99AQ", "B000EXDS34", "B00344EAKA", "B001M5UDGS"], "bought_together": ["B000EHSVN2", "B000EHSVM8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000EHSVM8", "B000EHSVLY", "B0046XG48O", "B000EHSVLE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 112363}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 34.59, "brand": "", "asin": "B0000DANYD", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/417707V8Z5L._SX300_.jpg", "title": "Buffy The Vampire Slayer - The Complete Sixth Season"}
{"description": "It's appropriate for a Michael Bay-Jerry Bruckheimer film that theBad Boys IIDVD is a visual and aural spectacle.  The picture is bright and vivid, and the soundtrack explosive and muscular (even without a DTS option--maybe there'll be a Superbit later).  There's no Bay commentary track as he did for theoriginal film, but he does appear in the disc 2 featurettes on stunts and visual effects describing the use of real props (check out the \"car flipper\" apparatus), CGI, and camera positioning (\"The theory of this car chase is to put cameras where cameramen would be killed doing these shots.\").Also filling out disc 2 are the in-depth scene deconstructions, which take six key scenes and allow you to view the sequence as it appeared in the film (a convenient touch), watch on-set footage, see the storyboards, and read the script (yes, there was a script).  The 19 \"production diaries\" may sound like text notes, but they offer even more on-set footage and factoids.

{"description": "Like its fellow HBO seriesSex and the City, this half-hour comedy broke some TV rules and went from critics' darling to an award-winning series in three years.Curb Your Enthusiasmis the brainchild of star-creator Larry David who co-createdSeinfeldand was the basis for the easily rattled George Costanza (who was played by Jason Alexander). Like George, David has a tendency to speak too much, blow things out of proportion, and, most often, fail in the end (and often liking it that way). David's new show is also like its predecessor: it's about \"nothing\" except following the day-to-day ramblings of a sometime writer and comic (this time in L.A.). Eternal questions stemming from universal daily dilemmas are honed to perfect comedic absurdity. A notable exception is the show is only scripted by plot; much of the action is improvised. The first season starts with a one-hour mockumentary following David's return to stand-up for the first time in years; the other 10 episodes follow a more traditional sit-com setup.David plays \"himself\" (as does his friend, Richard Lewis) although his manager and wife are played by comedians Jeff Garlin and Cheryl Hines. Although this first season is a comedic gem, one can't take more than an episode or two at a time--it's acidic, biting comedy. The episodes are often built like a house of cards, which the irritable David will surely collapse by the end. Like another caustic TV character, Dabney Colman's Buffalo Bill (1983-84), Larry David is not for everybody.--Doug ThomasStills fromCurb Your Enthusiasm- The Complete First Season(Click for larger image)&nbsp;&nbsp;", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0001US8EE", "B00067BCB8", "B0009WIE34", "B000FL7CAU", "B000VXK6Z0", "B002OOWKSA", "B003L77GMO", "B00EHJC7I8", "B00005JLEX", "B002LMV7RA", "B0002UE1WQ", "B000RW3VDE", "B008BLCP0S", "B008LCRAFC", "B008LCRABQ", "B008LCRA98", "B008LCRA7K", "B00AS86VFM", "B002LMV7QG", "B0002PYS7Y", "B0007YXRCW", "B00G4RIOOW", "B0018RKEQE", "B00020X852", "B00G4RIPE6", "B0013FSL0C", "B00EIJTLK4", "B001IBIDLI", "B0002ERXC2", "B008LCRAC0", "B005SEDI5M", "B00EHJC9AE", "B003L77GJM", "1929132360", "B00BGI07NK", "B000GGSMC6", "B0008KLV96", "B000A88ESW", "B00000G02H", "B0090XPH06", "B0007QS324", "B00J5LXT44", "B003R4ZMOA", "B000CQQID0", "B0058EE6NK", "B00ICR6SBI", "B009LDCVJU", "B00EEDNR9A", "B007WGDC7I", "B003Y5HWJU", "B00EPH8S58", "B001L1S1PS", "1592402305", "B000GETTKM", "B001DJLCRC", "B00608CD3I", "B00HUCF420", "B00JAQJNN0", "B005S97V82", "B0041KKZKA", "B000A9QKRI", "B008FRJDVC", "B000EXDS7K", "B001OQCVFG", "B006CR2OOA", "B000HRMAPE", "B00BUYWJEA", "B0006FO5LO", "1592408265", "B000P0J0D8", "B000B5XOR0", "B000RBA6CO", "B00C0UO1EY", "B0033WH6MW", "B00BI7ZAM2", "B0060MYKYY", "B0009A40ES", "B00019PDNY", "B003L77G06", "B002JVWQSW", "B002OOWKSU", "B000YABIQ6", "B009DA74D4", "B005LAJ16I", "B00BC5I6Q2", "B009LDD54K", "B0092QH902", "B003ES5JH4", "B0049AF6UG", "B00FOHHMWI", "B002AMUDK8", "B0019N8P2W", "B00GV8AZRI", "B005D0OHA6", "B001RTSPVY", "B0058YPG1G", "B008CFZQQS", "B0000640VJ", "B009LDD4BO"], "bought_together": ["B0001US8EE", "B00067BCB8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00067BCB8", "B0001US8EE", "B003L77GMO", "B0009WIE34"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 14356}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 20.99, "brand": "EMI", "asin": "B0000E2PVR", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZUW6F78XL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Curb Your Enthusiasm: Season 1"}

{"description": "This low-key, thoroughly delightful comedy is the product of Scottish comic/actor/writer/director Craig Ferguson's goofy and sweet imagination. Ferguson plays retired rock star Paul Kerr, a 1980s sensation whose whiskey-fueled antics in a Welsh mansion land him, involuntarily, in a psychiatric hospital. In short order, an old bandmate (Ralph Brown) turns up to help Paul get sober, and a long-lost love (Jemma Redgrave) introduces the mortified musician to an adolescent daughter (Charlotte Church) he never knew he had. Lots of catching up and relationship repairs ensue, but the film is really an off-center, eccentric comedy in which quaint villagers debate the origins of guitar feedback and 75-year-old veteran actor Joss Ackland (Surviving Picasso) can be found performing Roy Orbison rockers. A pleasant surprise is golden-throated Church's acting debut; revered for years as a singing prodigy, she proves to be a natural actress and outstanding pop-song stylist.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["0790748460", "B00003CXMY", "B000063K0J", "B005FHHD58", "B00CQRNLLU", "B001NFNFIU", "B000Z27HFE", "B0040JHF32", "B001053024", "B00007CVRM", "B00FBQ38VQ", "B00005Y6XP", "1573301469", "B0009U5DCQ", "0811853756", "B00005AUGM", "0061998494", "B00004ZDPO", "B00000I9CF", "B00002EPP9", "0811858197", "B000053VAE", "B0041QSZGU", "B004IY6AS0", "0061719544", "B000CSRSGY", "B0019BI19Q", "B000002PEY", "B007K7IBTI", "B0060RU2QO", "B00472O3C8", "B0007VCUGO", "B00FPPQYXM", "B00005NFY6", "B002I5GNZQ", "0752893394", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B0009PBLU4", "B00BTYU3QW", "B000G0F13K", "6305588236", "B00000ILEC", "B00008DDVT", "B002WY65UQ", "B008R3EYWM", "B0026RX2VE", "B00007GZZW", "B00005JLJC", "B002GOAH1U", "B0009OJ9R2", "B003OOH444", "B00AZMFO6I"], "bought_together": ["B00003CXMY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00003CXMY", "B00000I9CF", "0790748460", "B005MWPW86"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 47897}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.79, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B0000TG492", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51538Xcdj5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "I'll Be There"}

{"description": "ERkicked off its second season of high-intensity drama and wry humor by introducing a character who would turn out to be a long-term member of--and a major irritation for--the inner-city Chicago hospital staff.  After Mark Greene (Anthony Edwards) is promoted to attending physician, the door is open for a new chief resident, and in walks Kerry Weaver (Laura Innes), who wastes no time ruffling everyone's feathers with her strict managerial style and subtle putdowns. One of her prime targets, Susan Lewis (Sherry Stringfield), struggles to balance her personal and professional life when she has to take care of her abandoned infant niece.  The Lewis character grows the most during the season, along with second-year student John Carter (Noah Wylie), whose natural compassion gives way to professional ambition following the model of his teacher, ambitious and self-absorbed Peter Benton (Eriq LaSalle). Benton angles for a position with a renowned cardiovascular surgeon (Ron Rifkin) and has to deal with the fallout from a relationship with physician's assistant Jeannie Boulet (Gloria Reubens), yet he also starts to show some glimmers of humanity.Greene has his own problems trying to manage a long-distance marriage, while nurse Carol Hathaway (Julianna Margulies) bounces back from her aborted first-season marriage attempt to start a new relationship with paramedic Shep (Ron Eldard, who also became Margulies's real-life partner).  She buys her first house and enjoys an entire season out of the companionship of Doug Ross (George Clooney), who as always runs into problems with his cowboy style and philandering ways.  But just when he's finally driven himself out of the ER, he has to go play hero when he finds a boy pinned in a storm drain in an episode that was nominated for six Emmys and remains one of the, excuse the pun, high-water marks of the series. That and such episodes as \"The Healers,\" which deals with the aftermath of Shep's daring fire rescue, prove that whenERwas at its best, it was as good as anything on television.Guest appearances include Lucy Liu as the mother of an AIDS-stricken boy, Red Buttons as an elderly husband, Joanna Gleason as an infomercial producer, and Jake Lloyd (Star Wars: Episode I, The Phantom Menace) as the son of a prostitute. DVD bonus features are a little lighter than on the first-season set, consisting of a commentary track (by co-executive producer Mimi Leder, editor Randy Jon Morgan, and Laura Innes) on the season's first episode and \"The Healers,\" a nine-minute spotlight on \"Hell and High Water,\" an 11-minute piece on the series' multiple directors, 14 minutes of outtakes, and a gag reel.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004STBF5S", "B00005JLFT", "B004STBFPS", "B004STBFI0", "B004STBEXQ", "B000MTEFUK", "B000WMA74A", "B0015XHR5C", "B001FSKE8E", "B001JAHQ0W", "B001JAHQ16", "B001JAHQ1G", "B001L1S1OO", "B001JAHQ1Q", "B000GPPNO2", "B00005JNJ1", "B001AQT158", "B003F3NE1Q", "B001VPJZ0E", "B000FIMG5Y", "B001VPJZ0O", "B0018CWEZI", "B0018CWEXK", "B0001CCXZW", "B003LXM1B4", "B003F3NDW6", "B00684J49U", "B000FVQLIO", "B00005JO9J", "B003R0MEW2", "B0012CJQYQ", "B00I4581F4", "B0000A2ZNL", "B001OQCVCE", "B00188XHFI", "B003R0MEXQ", "B000P6YNSO", "B002BJGYTY", "B002E58FTC", "B001QE99AQ", "B000BX0VU0", "B00B04NIOU", "B002BJGYTO", "B00915G6TE", "B0015XWU9K", "B000BB1MIM", "B00124ONG0", "B001A4VH2U", "B0002WZTLQ", "B00D2UMHVA", "B001TKJDIU", "B0006IUE16", "B0001906X6", "B003LXM1PK", "B002BJGYV2", "B0047HXMNE", "B0018CWEVW", "B002BJGYU8", "B000R9YLKY", "B009RX7WTI", "B0012CJQY6", "B007PK8686", "B003FSTN5C", "B00EIXWMII", "B0058YPJ8G", "B0001ZDKXI", "B003R0MEZO", "B0053O89IS", "B000FIMG4U", "B000UX6TIE", "B000QUTTPG", "B0002I838Q", "B00684J49K", "B000068CNX", "B001CQONKY", "B009RX7IX8", "B0013FSL16", "B003CN5SAY", "B001JAHPXK", "B002WN8IR0", "B00GLT2TR6", "B0002I84FS", "B000N6TYLW", "B00HRUQA6O", "B003TNW04Y", "B005PYL8VQ", "B00GHH9HUE", "B0024FAD8I", "B002BAW6HW", "B0001O3YLM", "B001VPJYZU", "B005SEDI5M", "B000CELOV8", "B001PQZYQI", "B000YKYT1M", "B00008972G", "B000QFCDAO", "B000ION72Q", "B0046S8MRU", "B000BOH98G"], "bought_together": ["B00005JLFT", "B004STBF5S"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005JLFT", "B004STBF5S", "B000MTEFUK", "B000WMA74A"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 39927}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 21.79, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B0001AVZNU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510VRD5SQ6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "ER: Season 2"}
{"description": "As upscale sitcoms go,Something's Gotta Givehas more to offer than most romantic comedies. Obviously working through some semi-autobiographical issues regarding \"women of a certain age,\" writer-director Nancy Meyers brings adequate credibility and above-average intelligence to what is essentially (but not exclusively) a fantasy premise, in which an aging lothario who's always dated younger women (Jack Nicholson, more or less playing himself) falls for a successful middle-aged playwright (Diane Keaton) who's convinced she's past the age of romance, much less sexual re-awakening. As long as old pals Nicholson and Keaton are on screen discussing their dilemma or discovering their mutual desire,Something's Gotta Giveis terrific, proving (in case anyone had forgotten) that Hollywood can and should aim for an older demographic. Myers falls short with the sitcom device of a younger lover (Keanu Reeves) who wants Keaton as much as Nicholson does; it's believable but shallow and too easily dismissed. Myers also skimps on supporting roles for Frances McDormand, Amanda Peet, and Jon Favreau, but thankfully this is one romantic comedy that doesn't pander to youth. Mature viewers, rejoice!--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0038N9WKU", "0767811100", "B000MQC9H4", "B000YAF4MA", "B000OCZA04", "B0038N9X40", "B00AEFXYOA", "B00AEBB9WI", "B0000YTP1G", "B00AEBB8YW", "B000EMGJ7C", "B000YDBPAM", "B0000VD02Y", "B000023VTP", "B000EHRVOW", "B0009OL7Z4", "B00005JLSK", "B000XJD33O", "B0000542C9", "B00AEBB8NS", "B001ECDVK4", "B00006FMUW", "6304765266", "B004SEUJK0", "B003ASLJK4", "B0000AOV4I", "6305236569", "B002VECM6S", "B002K0WBXW", "B00008G7UF", "B000J103OI", "B0042816YK", "B00081U7HC", "6305213283", "B004SIP9RO", "B003BV8ICC", "B0015I2RT8", "078322740X", "6305212112", "B008R65XWO", "6305657947", "B0017ANAZO", "B0000JBALO", "B00EIBO8T6", "B00AEFYHVO", "B00005JNDZ", "B0099114WO", "B0088X7Z6S", "B007JNR54A", "B00005JPSM", "076784744X", "B002ZG988M", "B00386EZKE", "B000683VI4", "B00AEBB9FA", "B004EPZ070", "B00003CXSM", "B00AEFY99O", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00AEFY4CG", "B00005JG6N", "0783226772", "B000JYW5B4", "B003Y5H574", "B0038N9X3Q", "B002GHHHGU", "B000CCW2P2", "B00004TJKK", "B0017ANB08", "B00AEFXX9Q", "B000P0J0EW", "B004SIP8LG", "B000A343RI", "079073219X", "B0045HCJJ4", "B000CCBCAS", "B000HEWEE4", "0792833198", "B000765IJK", "B0002I84N0", "B001DDBCUA", "6304907729", "B003Y5H524", "B000ENC5YW", "B0007IO6NM", "B005S9EJ14", "B004FQX5B6", "B000HEWEJO", "B0001I55M4", "B00003CXFV", "B00005JLH0", "B00DDT0JB0", "B002U4UYYQ", "B00DW5ILUG", "B00005JN3W", "B00006ZXSO", "B00007E2F5", "B004SIP9VA", "B00118T632", "B004A8ZWSS"], "bought_together": ["B0038N9WKU", "B000MQC9H4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0038N9WKU", "0767811100", "B000MQC9H4", "B00AEBB9WI"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 2886}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.79, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B0001AVZA8", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Q5RC1103L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Something's Gotta Give"}

{"description": "After a long wait--like the entire fifth season--Carrie Bradshaw (Sarah Jessica Parker) is dating again. The sixth season of the popular HBO show starts with Carrie and her sparkly new potential, Berger (Ron Livingston), trying to leave past relationships and hit it off. The results are mixed (up to Berger's memorable exit), but the good news is Carrie is at it again, and a new love interest can be found in the member of a wedding party, an old high school flame (David Duchovny), or an &uuml;ber-famous painter (Mikhail Baryshnikov). As Carrie plays the field, her friends seem to be settling down, relatively speaking. Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) decides that her affair with TiVo cannot compete when Mr. Perfect (Blair Underwood, at his most charming) moves into her building. Charlotte's (Kristin Davis) feelings for her \"opposites attract\" boyfriend (Evan Handler, perhaps fans' most-loved boyfriend) deepen, but they still have a few things to iron out. Most surprising is Samantha's (Kim Cattrall) hot relationship with waiter-actor-stud Smith Jerrod (Jason Lewis) taking on something resembling love, despite Samantha's best intentions.Before the sixth season started in the summer of 2003, a bombshell hit: it was announced that this would be the finale. Fans, just getting over the truncated fifth season (due to half the cast getting pregnant), were beside themselves. But it would be a long season, and these 12 episodes plant the seeds for the final 8 airing the following winter. These dozen episodes illustrate the maturity of the show: there's not a bad one in the bunch, with things like old flames Mr. Big (Chris Noth), and Steve (David Eigenberg) popping in with deeper resiliency. And the show is still flat-out funny. Berger is the most intrinsically humorous of Carrie's beaus (his introduction to Prada is a classic), Jarrod's earnest streak on Samantha gets her flabbergasted in the giddiest ways, and Charlotte's attempt to convert to Judaism is right in character. The touchstone episode is \"A Woman's Right to Shoes,\" in which Carrie loses her prized and expensive Manolo Blahniks at a party. The comedy blends serious points of how we perceive singles, couples, and parents (and the gifts we lavish on the latter two). Carrie's method of celebrating her singlehood is just another gem in this treasure of a series.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00382S9UA", "B00382S9TQ", "B00382S9T6", "B00382S9SW", "B00382S9SM", "B00004RFCM", "B00AYVDUPW", "B00005AVCA", "B002ZG98Z0", "B001DDBCUA", "B006WZIB1C", "B00AQ5RRJQ", "B001675YWK", "B005IFIUEU", "B002ZG98ZA", "B00FKNR3W0", "B001GTZEZ0", "B00079FUI6", "B002PJ4HNK", "B001DDBCV4", "B00IKX4LEK", "B000P6YNTI", "B00AIQAS76", "B00009Y3RW", "B000W6ZUUC", "0446617687", "B005Z28M58", "B001PQZYQI", "B001AQBGM4", "B0013FSL16", "B000HIVIOC", "B002BJGYV2", "B000EQ45BU", "B003R0MEXQ", "B000FIMG4U", "B003L77GFG", "B0018CWEYO", "B00EF4U7JQ", "B001VPJYZK", "B0042816YK", "B00D8H3LR6", "B003Y5HWGI", "B002BJGYU8", "B0007R4SWC", "B002BJGYTY", "B00005K3NR", "B002BJGYTO", "B000068CNX", "B00DRSGQ7I", "B0001907BW", "B0000844MI", "B008NFN33U", "B0002I84FS", "B0037XPPAM", "B0009WFEEG", "B00000FBH2", "B003F3NDP8", "B001BL96K2", "B000RBA6CO", "B0001CCXZW", "B0018RKEQY", "B001DPHDBU", "B005IA9JRM", "B00466HN7M", "B002AMVED8", "B004YM6JF0", "B00001W9G0", "B004SEUJK0", "B000P6YNSO", "B000069HYG", "B00005JNDZ", "B005IA9JQI", "B001FB4VX0", "B0083XXVFW", "B005LAIIHG", "B00JM5C8WM", "B00005JMYI", "B000XKW2WG", "B001DJLCRC", "B00AEBB8YW", "B000VDDE0E", "B00E8RKHWW", "B008JFUOWM", "B0001I561E", "B00AEFYM2S", "B002ZG976U", "B00DL47424"], "bought_together": ["B00382S9UA", "B00382S9TQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00004RFCM", "B00382S9TQ", "B00382S9SM", "B00382S9T6"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 31405}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 28.48, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B0001ENX5E", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DH7CZ5DNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Sex and the City: Season 6, Part 1"}

{"description": "No actor works harder to open a movie than Tom Cruise. His enthusiasm is throughout the DVD extras as he mirrors his samurai character by constantly talking about \"loyalty\" and \"discipline\" while working on the film. However as a post-movie experience, the top-line extras with Cruise and director Edward Zwick are repetitive and underwhelming, with too many clips from the film we assume DVD viewers have just seen. The History Channel show is also a pre-release promotional device that misses an opportunity to really dig into this intriguing time period. Better are segments on the costumes, the production design, and how you put together an Imperial army--in New Zealand, no less. Zwick's low-key and dense commentary (plus a \"Video Journal\") is not vital, but he illustrates many of the little peculiarities it took to make the wide-ranging film come together. There are two deleted scenes; a samurai's first appearance is particularly memorable.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEFY5B6", "B002O3Z50Q", "B00004XPPG", "B00AMSLDTM", "B0002YLCG0", "B0000DZTIW", "B000AARKOO", "B000QXDED6", "B003U0AHBO", "B00AEFXKUI", "B000A2WP7O", "B008MIMWOY", "B00AEBBA36", "B004AOECXI", "6305692688", "B000MGB6NM", "B0000TANUI", "079283366X", "B00005JL78", "B000W1SZBS", "B004SIP88Y", "B0034G4P58", "B001TUZG4K", "B00AS1Q93S", "B000MRA592", "B00001ZWUS", "B000E5N6LG", "B000XR9L50", "B0001HLVS2", "B00HEPDGKA", "B003ASLJO0", "B00AEBB9NM", "B000P0J0EW", "B0000A2ZNX", "B00005JNTI", "B0018QPPXW", "B000065U1N", "B000095WW8", "B0002WZTOI", "B002VWNIEA", "B004U7MQWY", "B002VWNID6", "B008JFUO36", "B00AEBB86A", "B00005JN0W", "B0007Q6VXC", "B001LRJH0U", "B000MZHW40", "B0002IQMAM", "B00004WG2F", "B003INBO3I", "B000EHRVMY", "B000NOKFHQ", "B000P0J0EM", "B00AEFXVCU", "B000YENUI6", "B000M341QE", "B0000YEEGM", "B001680M26", "B008R65XYC", "B002ZG99QS", "B00008K76U", "B000HRMAPE", "B007TBKAXK", "B00000G3PA", "0767810856", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B00AEFXYJA", "B002T9H2LA", "B000P0J0AG", "B00003CXZ1", "B000O599YO", "B000FS9FCG", "6304711905", "B00AEFXRRO", "B000HRMAUY", "B001ILHY1I", "B002NZK5V4", "B002VWNICC", "B000VKL6ZM", "B001UDS4BS", "B002ZG997C", "B004SIP8ZM", "0800177967", "B0001O3YD0", "B00005ATZT", "B004XFZ3UU", "B00004Z4WR", "B005LAIH2W", "B0007TKNGA", "B00000JQB5", "B0012Q732O", "B002ZG97RE", "B0002VEUV2", "0800141741", "B002ZG977Y", "B00005N5S3", "B00008G8M4", "B0000B1OFL"], "bought_together": ["B00AEFY5B6", "B00004XPPG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000QXDED6", "B00BEJL6JK", "B00AEFXXMI", "B00JU949TK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 121880}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 17.25, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B0001JXOUS", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51EdSWs9r9L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Last Samurai (Full Screen Edition)"}
{"description": "In some ways, HBO'sSix Feet Underplays kid brother to stellar BMOCThe Sopranos: it's spunkier, less refined, chancier, and a bit of a punk. Nevertheless, the show set in the Southern California mortuary Fisher and Sons deserves its place in the pantheon of great television series. The initial season was a showcase for the most original characters, including tight-lipped brother David (Michael C. Hall) coming out of the closet, emotionally trippy mom Ruth (Frances Conroy), and the most complex girlfriend on the face of the planet, Brenda (Rachel Griffiths). Slowly, the major force in season 2 is the unassuming lead, Peter Krause. Part of the long line of good-looking actors who never get respect because they make it look too easy, Krause (Sports Night) finds the perfect blend of optimism with a wonderful, bittersweet anguish as Nate, the prodigal son.The initial season's happy ending is forgotten as relationships change, the business is still under fire from the evil conglomerate Kroehner, and a lively dream sequence is just around the corner. As with the premier season, creator Alan Ball lets many others direct and write the show, but his stamp is all over it. The eccentricities of the characters are shaped, and not always suddenly. Take daughter Claire (Lauren Ambrose), who sheds her bad boyfriend only to find more complex relationships on her road to discovering her own groove. One person in the mix is Ruth's beatnik sister (Patricia Clarkson, in an Emmy-winning role), a joyous embodiment of thriving--if aging--counter culture. Another new character is Nate's old girlfriend, the granola-loving Lisa (Lili Taylor). With Brenda heading down another destructive course, Nate is at more than one crossroads by season's end. For fans who groove with the wild, serio-comedic world of the Fishers (and let's face it, many didn't), the second season goes down like a fine meal of fusion cuisine. The show shares an unfortunate family trait with its HBO big brother: although both were lavished with multiple Emmy nominations the first two seasons, both took home only token awards. But then there's always next year.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0007R4SWM", "B0009NZ2W4", "B000E6EK42", "B005SEDI5M", "B000GTLQVW", "B004BZ5AHI", "B005FISBTO", "B008PJZDXW", "B000RTBDV4", "B0015ABRE2", "B00915G6WQ", "B00DXP7L88", "B002N5N5M0", "B00000FBH2", "B000V86OKG", "B003L77GRO", "B000Q6GUW0", "B0011UMC72", "B00005Y6YJ", "B000G1R4TS", "B000FFJYE8", "B0009GV9E6", "B00EEDNR9A", "B0009MAPXG", "B002ZCY8CC", "B0060MYKYY", "B00008PW1F", "B00031TYBC", "B005HAOZDQ", "B00HW3EXCE", "B000067S1G", "B003L77GS8", "B000Q6GUKW", "B0007YMVWO", "B009TE9HAW", "B00005NOHO", "B003L77GTC", "B001OQCVFG", "B0000Y40PW", "B001RTSPVY", "B00GWJIDFW", "B002AMVED8", "B001GCUER0", "B000NA1VI2", "B00J5LXT44", "B0012CJQYG", "B003L77GLA", "B00EIL7E9C", "B0032UYFA6", "B00BC5I6Q2", "B001AQBGM4", "B00HUAGZ34", "B0058YPG1G", "B0038M2AOG", "B001EO748M", "B00AS811S4", "B000YABIQ6", "B001DJLCRC", "B00166UFSY", "B00003CXOP", "B002LITH76", "B002ZCY82W", "B0041KKZKA", "B000FUTVLO", "B005LAJ1O0", "B000BO7DWI", "B00ADQPB50", "B00BUYWJEA", "B0006IUD9Y", "B0090XPH06", "B0029O0ANW", "B0006FO5LO", "B004X1VUNI", "B000FTCLSU", "B0042U9B3G", "B003FSTN7K", "B002OOWKSU", "B00FQY4C86", "B0001O3YLM", "B009LDD54K", "B00123BY6S", "B000QXDJLI", "B00005RIY5", "B00JBGSHSQ", "B00DNUSFZQ", "B004HW7JH4", "B001B7CNZ6", "B00BVMXBDO", "B00ECGHM5O", "B000P12LWY", "B00AB65RUG", "B000QUTTPG", "B00511N7B2", "B00BUUAV08", "B0002ERXC2", "B000NVI2GU", "B0013FSL0C", "B00005Y1YA"], "bought_together": ["B0007R4SWM", "B0009NZ2W4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005SEDI5M", "B002N57KGM", "B0007R4SWM", "B0009NZ2W4"]}, "price": 22.96, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 13483}, "asin": "B0001KL5DA", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51NVNKeJ8hL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Six Feet Under - The Complete Second Season"}

{"description": "Johnny Depp gets high off another acting challenge in this tricky adaptation of aStephen King yarn. Although the mood is too sinister to allow for the mischief of hisPirates of the Caribbeanturn, Depp still manages to embroider his role here with plenty of quirky business. He plays a writer, depressed and nearly divorced, who's stuck in an isolated cabin (shades ofThe Shining) when a stranger (John Turturro) arrives, accusing him of plagiarism. Writer-director David Koepp (Stir of Echoes) does his best to make the rickety material compelling--he gets the maximum out of the cabin set, for instance--but the problems inherent in the King story eventually win out. The climactic scenes are particularly unpleasant, especially in contrast to the cleverness of Depp's performance.

{"description": "The seventh and final season ofBuffy the Vampire Slayerbegins with a mystery: someone is murdering teenage girls all over the world and something is trying hard to drive Spike mad. Buffy is considerably more cheerful in these episodes than we have seen her during the previous year as she trains Dawn and gets a job as student counselor at the newly rebuilt Sunnydale High. Willow is recovering from the magical addiction which almost led her to destroy the world, but all is not yet well with her, or with Anya, who has returned to being a Vengeance demon in \"Same Time, Same Place\" and \"Selfless,\" and both women are haunted by their decisions.Haunting of a different kind comes in the excellent \"Conversations with Dead People\" (one of the show's most terrifying episodes ever), in which a mysterious song is making Spike kill again in spite of his soul and his chip. Giles turns up in \"Bring on the Night\" and Buffy has to fight one of the deadliest vampires of her career in \"Showtime\". In \"Potential\" Dawn faces a fundamental reassessment of her purpose in life.Buffywas always a show about female empowerment, but it was also a show about how ordinary people can decide to make a difference alongside people who are special. And it was also a show about people making up for past errors and crimes. So, for example, we have the excellent episodes \"Storyteller\", in which the former geek/supervillain Andrew sorts out his redemption while making a video diary about life with Buffy; and \"Lies My Parents Told Me,\" in which we find out why a particular folk song sends Spike crazy. Redemption abounds as Faith returns to Sunnydale and the friends she once betrayed, and Willow finds herself turning into the man she flayed. Above all, this was always Buffy's show: Sarah Michelle Gellar does extraordinary work here both as Buffy and as her ultimate shadow, the First Evil, who takes her face to mock her. This is a fine ending to one of television's most remarkable shows.--Roz Kaveney", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000EHSVMS", "B000EHSVM8", "B000EHSVLY", "B000EHSVLE", "B000EHSVL4", "B000EHSVKK", "B000I0QLRS", "B000I0QLQY", "B000I0QLS2", "B000I0QLR8", "B000I0QLRI", "B007H9CNOI", "B003YF9Q08", "B000HD1482", "B0009W5J4Q", "B0006IUE16", "B002JVWR4U", "B000B5XOW0", "1593078226", "B00466H3CW", "B000CCBCGM", "B005CM1IIE", "B000GG4Y6O", "B000ERVJM2", "B006LG74Q0", "B00AMDA2QC", "B000JLTRIG", "B00344EAQO", "B00006J3WH", "B0024FAR66", "B0000AQS0F", "B000O77SMW", "B003R4ZMN6", "1595825584", "B000OIOPHC", "B000X5SPBI", "B000BOH98G", "B001FB4W0C", "B00243FQFA", "B00001R3O1", "B000BOH990", "B00076ONT6", "B000BOH986", "B00K0D9760", "B000CNE0SS", "B002U8XW9Q", "B0009HI5KQ", "B001BN4WL8", "B0002XVKMM", "B000EXDS34", "B000O77SN6", "B009LDCXNY", "B001MVWRNE", "B00HEQOAIQ", "B00511N79O", "B0017MO11O", "B0010YSD7M", "1595826106", "B0006GAOP4", "B00133QNRW", "1595823425", "1595829229", "1595821651", "0789326302", "B000QDLSR0", "B00IKM5LXG", "B003L77G8I", "B0009JE6FC", "B003TNW030", "B000FP2OPY", "B0024FAD9C", "B000RO6JYK", "B000VDDE0E", "B009LDD4V4", "1595824154", "B000CNE0TC", "B001MVWRNO", "B000095ZH2", "B002JVWRAO", "B000EXDS3E", "1595828885", "159307963X", "B00JF5G8WU", "B000A5045Q", "B0024FAR6G", "B009LDCWWG", "B000CNE0T2", "B0000844I8", "B000R7GKQE", "B00005Y1NF", "B001ULDJU6", "B003KW7CQ0", "B00BEJL6JK", "B001B7CNZ6", "B001992NWO", "B000FL7CAK", "B0006J28E6", "B004V8W4YM", "B000P0I4P8", "B005PPMHO2"], "bought_together": ["B000EHSVMS", "B000EHSVM8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000EHSVMS", "B000EHSVM8", "B000EHSVLY", "B000EHSVKK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 154931}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 19.98, "brand": "", "asin": "B0002XVKMC", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51C7GTP7R4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Buffy the Vampire Slayer - The Complete Seventh Season"}
{"description": "With less drama and more slapstick than its predecessor, Disney'sMulan IIcontinues the animated saga of the young Chinese heroine, Fa Mulan (voiced by Ming-Na Wen, sung by Lea Salonga). The story picks up one month after Mulan has saved her country through bravery and determination. Revered by all, she now returns to her village and becomes engaged to General Li Shang. Wedding plans must wait, however, when the Emperor assigns the couple to a secret mission to escort his three princess daughters across China where their arranged marriages to waiting princes will secure an alliance with a rival kingdom and save China from invasion. Meanwhile, Mulan's wise-cracking guardian dragon, Mushu (voiced by Mark Moseley), realizes that if Mulan's marriage takes place, he is out of a job and so he undertakes his \"18-phase master plan\" of relationship sabotage to breakup the happy couple. Most of the film's jokes come from Moseley's Mushu (as quick-witted as Eddie Murphy's earlier performance), while a trio of prankish soldiers provide additional comic relief. While the film's overall effort is not as sensational as the original, it offers solid family entertainment, healthy female role models, and a handful of catchy songs.

{"description": "The early-'90sBatmanseries was probably the best animated superhero show ever, mixing stylish animation with a dark tone appropriate for the Dark Knight.  The second volume, comprising four discs of 28 episodes and vastly preferable to the many single-disc releases, features familiar characters the Joker, Catwoman, the Penguin, Two-Face, Poison Ivy, as well as the first appearances of the Riddler, and Ra's Al Ghul and Talia.  The episodes are highlighted by the Emmy-winning two-parter \"Robin's Reckoning,\" which recounts the origin of the Boy Wonder and his chance for revenge years later.  In \"Perchance to Dream,\" Bruce Wayne finds his parents alive and another Batman patrolling Gotham City, the two-part \"Something\" pits Batman against Miyazaki-styled robots, and Batman revisits the samurai training of his past in \"Night of the Ninja\" and \"Day of the Samurai.\" Give the series credit for not talking down to kids--Japanese characters spoke in Japanese with English subtitles, and one episode, \"Almost Got 'Im,\" was styled after a '50s black-and-white variety show.  It employed smart humor and characterization even to the point where it could let villains carry an episode. Certain stories were based on comic books, and the series involved comics veterans such as Denny O'Neil and Len Wein.  Also camp-master Adam West appears as the voice of the Grey Ghost.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0007XG43W", "B000B7QCHC", "B00023E894", "B000YDBP84", "B002LWJ510", "B000A9QKLE", "B000A9QKL4", "B000F4RH8E", "B000B7QCGS", "B0002ZMHX6", "B000GYI336", "B000LE1798", "B000CSTK42", "B00LT1JHLW", "B000A9QKLO", "B003XMZVHY", "B000F4RH8O", "B000LE17A2", "B000CEXFZ6", "B000CSTK3S", "B0009UZG28", "B000UPMZ1M", "B000M2E32W", "B00005Y71G", "B003L7DK88", "B000GYI33Q", "B000FZETS4", "B0016OM3WC", "B001QIVEVO", "B001QIVEVE", "B005SH63HO", "B004L9GM3A", "B001A5ES9I", "B00005Y71J", "B002DYKPF6", "B00DP9MDE4", "B001614E68", "B002DYKPFQ", "B0036EH3XY", "B003ITZBVS", "B005SH6482", "B00GJ6HQDI", "B000OPODNG", "B005HN69G4", "B002FGUHBE", "B00GZ0ML4C", "B003UN2ICM", "1401207529", "B005CSYQ2S", "B003ITZBVI", "B002YOKVUY", "B004XKVRBE", "B008RV5K5E", "B000PFSYO4", "B00CPEK3NI", "B009OAWMK8", "B00GD9GNEY", "1401216676", "B000ATQYVA", "B00BTJV9RO", "B00IGVJH0E", "1401232590", "B0089TQ70Q", "B0031L5CJE", "B00A2LOAKI", "1401232744", "B0007XFZMS", "B00HFWETQW", "B00HMOW9YM", "1401223176", "1401244025", "B006PA0WF2", "B000A59PLU", "B00GZ0ML2Y", "B003F3NE4S", "B0039208QM", "B002A5EBLW", "B0018TNMCA", "B00CENSU1W", "B000PE0G0A", "B000G1R39Y", "B0002W4SY0", "1401211534", "1563893428", "B001LK8SQ6", "B002K0WBDM", "B001PU8N26", "0785124985", "B00DP9RYDY", "B0027FG29Y", "B000EHSVG4", "1401235425", "B003XTUAHS", "B001614FX0", "B007KW5MOU", "1401233791", "B00HRUQAKU", "B00J8LXD60", "B004ZKKL14", "B0007NFMCG"], "bought_together": ["B0007XG43W", "B000B7QCHC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00023E894", "B0007XG43W", "B000A9QKLE", "B001QIVEVE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 8662}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 32.61, "brand": "Warner Brothers", "asin": "B0002ZMHWM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Kgt4kAXZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Batman: The Animated Series, Volume Two (DC Comics Classic Collection)"}

{"description": "After seven long years trying to return home, it's no surprise that the seventh season ofVoyagerwas emotional.  It begins with the resolution to season 6's \"Unimatrix Zero,\" in which Janeway (Kate Mulgrew), Torres (Roxann Biggs-Dawson), and Tuvok (Tim Russ) must find a way off the Borg Cube and Seven of Nine (Jeri Ryan) faces the loss of the precious bit of humanity she has just discovered. \"Human Error\" focuses on Seven's further attempts to explore her human side (a romance comes from out of the blue).  And if Seven isn't the cast's most fascinating character, it's the other crew member struggling to find his not-quite-human identity, the Doctor (Robert Picardo).  In \"Body and Soul,\" the Doctor gets to experience physical life in the body of--who else?--Seven.  He writes a novel in \"Author, Author,\" and in the first of a pair of excellent two-parters, \"Flesh and Blood,\" he explores what it means to be a hologram in the midst of a deadly situation involving the Hirogen.  In the second two-parter, \"Workforce,\" the crew is kidnapped and brainwashed into becoming ordinary laborers on a planet with a worker shortage, but Janeway is forced to question whether she wouldn't prefer this version of a normal, stable life.The seventh season also saw the firstTrekwedding since Dax-Worff, the return of the old Federation-Maquis conflict, the continuing efforts of Lt. Reginald Barclay (Dwight Schultz) to bringVoyagerhome, Kim (Garrett Wang) taking command twice (once with the help of the Emergency Command Hologram), the return of Q, and Neelix's discovery of a group of fellow Talaxians.  The final episode, \"Endgame,\" is less concerned with misty-eyed goodbyes than with a bending of conventional views of the space-time continuum that leads to an exciting showdown with the Borg queen (Alice Krige, repeating her role fromStar Trek: First Contactbut making her first appearance onVoyager).  DVD bonus features include the usual season recap, a 12-minute featurette on the final episode, and a crew profile of the Doctor.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00062IDLA", "B0002WZTCA", "B0002JP4GE", "B000228EBS", "B0001NBNFW", "B000127LW2", "B00008KA57", "B00008KA58", "B0009I7NGW", "B000A6CLL0", "B000AOEMXC", "B00008KA59", "B00005JLF5", "B00008KA5A", "B00008972H", "B00008KGT0", "B00BHWG0CM", "B0007TKH66", "B00BHWG0DQ", "B000063V8S", "B000063V8T", "B000AOEMXM", "B000063V8R", "B002HQKRBC", "B00062RCC6", "B00005Y1NF", "B000062XFG", "B000RZIGVS", "B001DHXT6G", "B000W4KT9G", "B00KHA9BQ2", "B000CCBCIA", "B00CYQXHLC", "B0017VG69U", "B000BR9SA0", "B00GTZWZH6", "B0019N95IK", "B001DHXT3Y", "B003H9LIRK", "B0000AUHOH", "B00076ONT6", "B002I9Z8I0", "B000WTZ6SK", "B00402FGE4", "B0009HI5KQ", "B00K0D9760", "B002I9Z8GM", "B000EXDS34", "B000CNE0T2", "B00HETWFVC", "B000F8O2PQ", "B001AGXEBU", "B000BOH990", "B000BNI90Y", "B0009JE6G6", "B00BHWG0G8", "B00005JKHP", "B0040NFQ0W", "B0006IUDXA", "B000CNE0TC", "B004FECNJ8", "B00JK47BHM", "B008JFUS0U", "B002BAW6H2", "B001TH16DS", "B00IURL19Y", "B004TJ1H3C", "B000XCZGW2", "B000ERVJJ0", "6303961614", "B00BAXTYIA", "B0013LRKVC", "B00000ILBK", "B00GX7D5G0", "B00AMDA2QC", "B0006GAOP4", "B000AJJNFE", "B00272NJ66", "B007AAEZY0", "B000F8O2PG", "B000B8IA2G", "B001G0MFPG", "B000Z7G87C", "B001O0TWY0", "B00FFEM0W2", "B00AMDA2P8", "B000EXDS3E", "B002BAW6FY", "B00F6WXPSQ", "B00IWTVDUW", "B000F9T70A", "0767802454", "B002XKKX7K", "B00AJXO48W", "B001CQONNQ", "B006MFQ4DE", "B000GRUMQY", "B000HEZEY6", "B00466H3CW", "B000CNE0SS"], "bought_together": ["B00062IDLA", "B0002WZTCA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0002WZTCA", "B000127LW2", "B0001NBNFW", "B00062IDLA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 27683}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 40.12, "brand": "Paramount", "asin": "B00062IDCO", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Bn4nydiVL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Star Trek Voyager - The Complete Seventh Season"}

{"description": "Submitted for your approval:The Twilight Zone's inaugural season, all 36 episodes complete with Rod Serling's original promos for the following week's episode, not seen since their original broadcast. To discuss television's greatest anthology series whose title has become pop culture shorthand for the bizarre and supernatural is to immediately become like Albert Brooks and Dan Aykroyd inTwilight Zone: The Movie; a can-you-top-this recall of famous shocks and favorite twists. Several essential episodes hail from this season, among them, \"Time Enough at Last\" starring Burgess Meredith as a bespectacled bookworm who is the lone survivor of an atomic blast; \"The After-Hours\" starring Anne Francis as a department store shopper haunted by mannequins; and the profoundly disturbing \"The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street,\" in which fear and prejudice turns neighbor against neighbor (and, by the by, whose alien observers inspired Kang and Kodos onThe Simpsons).From an unsettlingly persistent hitchhiker to a malevolent slot machine,The Twilight Zone's first season did plumb \"the pit of man's fears.\" One forgets how moving the series could be. Three of this season's most memorable and enduring episodes are the poignant and primal \"stop-the-world-I-want-to-get-off fantasies, \"Walking Distance,\" \"A Stop at Willougby\" and \"The Sixteen-Millimeter Shrine,\" in which desperate characters seek refuge in a simpler past. Serling's few stabs at comedy (\"Mr. Bevis,\" \"The Mighty Casey\") have not aged well, but the series finale, \"A World of His Own,\" starring Keenan Wynn as a playwright whose fictional characters come to life, has a brilliant capper. The episodes are more deliberately paced than one might remember. Less patient younger viewers might be anxious to get to the payoffs, but once they settle into the rhythm, they will savor the literate writing and the performances by such veteran actors as Ed Wynn, Everett Sloan, and Ida Lupino, and newcomers such as Jack Klugman. The extras, including the unaired version of the pilot episode, \"Where is Everybody?\", audio commentaries and recollections, and a Serling college lecture, truly take this six-disc set to another dimension.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00BQK4YDC", "B00C6F61S2", "B000BC8T1E", "B00CPTUN8S", "B000AL733G", "B000AYEIIQ", "B00068NVLQ", "B0002CX1M0", "B0002J4ZX2", "B001DXS4DI", "B000HDR814", "B002NPY7GS", "B006TBYC76", "1879505096", "B000VDDDY6", "B0000DC3VM", "B000UAE7VS", "B0007Y08P6", "B00005JOJE", "B00092ZLDK", "B0009UC7MK", "B0007Y08RY", "B000O59A52", "B00198X0YK", "B00007ELE6", "B001DHXT3Y", "B00269PU2G", "B000LC4ZIA", "B000GETUDI", "B006TTC5A4", "B00H4KQN82", "B002TSAAS8", "B005UL4NF2", "B001E6HUWK", "B000BITV1A", "B001LM64VK", "B00JEZWRE4", "B003NOGNQU", "B0017VG69U", "B001DB6J50", "B00005N5RM", "B000062XFG", "B00133QNSG", "B000N2HD6O", "B000CCBCD0", "B001G0MFLU", "B00005LC4K", "B000Z6GT1I", "B000TXPXD2", "B000HWZ4HU", "B000SSQ7JW", "B000IHYXJO", "B00005Y1NF", "B000H5U5EE", "B008L36520", "B005LVIP1E", "B0019F030M", "B001AQO43M", "B000TJBNF8", "B0019PL2JI", "B000063V8S", "B000B7HZUK", "B001992NZG", "B0002WZTLQ", "B0000714AP", "B00D97DMQU", "B00D9EJFZA", "B000CNE0TC", "B005E7SEOI", "B00009VRF0", "B000HEZEYG", "B003CN5B7E", "B004FECNJ8", "B000MGBSH6", "B000F48D0U", "B00005JLRT", "B000TLTCT0", "B003L77G7Y", "B007KFZ85K", "B002GSXKQA", "B0040NFQ0W", "B001RIZ7OI", "B0089LT7ZG", "B000ASDFIQ", "B0007Y08LK", "B000T9OP7G", "B000BF0C8E", "B001JFKWE4", "B00A2L1CKO", "B00DZP1C9K", "0783240961", "B00871C09S", "B001GUYAZY", "B000FA57U8", "B000QQJ3Q0", "B0000VD04M", "B000BGR1B4", "B00ANGIAU8", "B000GW8UAE", "B0001WTWS8"], "bought_together": ["B00BQK4YDC", "B00C6F61S2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000H5U5EE", "B00BQK4YDC", "B00C6F61S2", "B00D9EJG2M"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 107871}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 42.09, "brand": "Image Entertainment", "asin": "B00068NVMK", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51EzHtftO7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Twilight Zone - Season 1 (The Definitive Edition)"}

{"description": "The unprecedented resurrection ofFamily Guydisproves Neil Young's maxim that \"Once you're gone, you can never come back.\" Unceremoniously canceled in 2002, the irreverent animated series proved to be a phenomenal seller on DVD, prompting not only a rerun revival on basic cable,  but also a new season. For those who have only recently made the acquaintance of the dysfunctional Griffins, this five-episode sampler is representative of the series' \"nothing is sacred\" comic universe. Creator Seth MacFarlane chose well: \"When You Wish Upon a Weinstein,\" which was banned during the series' original run; \"Lethal Weapons\"; \"To Live and Die in Dixie\"; \"I Am Peter, Hear Me Roar\"; and \"Road to Rhode Island.\" In addition to the restoration of a previously censored gag involving Osama Bin Laden in \"Rhode Island,\" what does this collection bring to the party for theFamily Guyfan who has everything? Four new episode commentaries, the best of which features MacFarlane in character as chain-smoking, martini swilling, talking dog Brian, and megalomaniacal infant Stewie for \"Rhode Island.\" There is also an interview with MacFarlane about why he chose these episodes, and a fitfully amusing sneak peak at MacFarlane's new series,American Dad. But as this collection reminds us,Family Guyis a tough act to follow.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000A3DFV8", "B003V3FVQ6", "B001N9VW5Y", "B000HT3P6U", "B000RO6JZO", "B000AQ68Z0", "B0012018OE", "B001VFM0ZG", "B00008YGRV", "B003DZX46G", "B000083C6V", "B003L77G9W", "B00E0FW054", "B00FR81Z40", "B0058YPMHO", "B0040JHX0W", "B0064ESJ18", "B000YOX3HE", "B001RP976A", "B003X4KHRG", "B002C11LCG", "B002HQK5O6", "B000E6ES9O", "B002LARYTW", "B00GJPUXKC", "B000NNK4DM", "B002XY6A46", "B001RIZ7OI", "B003CN5B7E", "B002XXYIVO", "B000E0OE3K", "B00HDU9UOW", "B002JVWQYG", "B0058RN7KA", "B0053O8A32", "B00009N80Z", "B0044E9JTG", "B0012KSUTA", "B002FGUHBE", "B003L77G7Y", "B007Z3UUF0", "B0002XVQT4", "B008SM81XU", "B000PFSYO4", "B008R65XNS", "B000WGYMGK", "B000EJ9VDY", "B00BI5YEWG", "B0000AGWRT", "B0002IQK7M", "B000850JTY", "B00BYNL8DU", "B000022TSW", "B000VQYDJM", "B0006Z2L2Y", "B0006Z2LMO", "B00005JM3G", "B005LAII12", "B00006FDCD", "B000MR74IC"], "bought_together": ["B000A3DFV8", "B003V3FVQ6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00E0FW054", "B000HT3P6U", "B000A3DFV8", "B000AQ68Z0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 73029}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 9.1, "brand": "TCFHE", "asin": "B0006B41GM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51T062HDJBL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Family Guy - The Freakin' Sweet Collection"}
{"description": "This breathtaking blend of documentary and fiction filmmaking provides an  unobtrusive glimpse into the relationships, rituals, and livelihood of a  four-generation family of nomadic shepherds in the Gobi desert of South  Mongolia. It is birthing season for the family&#x92;s herd of camels and after  several healthy foals are born, the last birth is difficult. With quiet  perseverance, the family helps to deliver a rare white colt, which the  mother camel quickly rejects and refuses to nurse. With growing  concern for the colt&#x92;s survival, the family decides to employ a nomadic  singing ritual to coax the mother into nurturing her young. They send the  two eldest sons on a journey to the nearest village to fetch a musician for  the \"hoos ritual.\" The story unfolds gently, sensitive to the rhythms of  desert life while honoring its real-life actors. This modest yet magnificent  film is the graduation project of film students Byambasuren Davaa and Luigi  Falorni, extending beyond the tale of a camel and colt to explore the  fragility and beauty of an ancient way of life. Rated PG for some mild  thematic content. (Ages 8 and older)--Lynn Gibson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000KHX70S", "B000065V3Z", "B00004VVO5", "B001139ZIS", "B000GYI3J0", "B000MGBLVE", "034911580X", "B0074JODJO", "B002U4F5W2", "B00004YKS7", "B00005UQ8P", "B0010S6ERY", "B00005JLD4", "B001N6FPRI", "B002M36R50", "B00116VG3M", "B001CDLAUS", "B0001BRSRG", "1741793173", "B000KX0IPE", "B00346UX5E", "B005I0DV4Y", "B006IW8E3Y", "B002ZG974M", "092417191X", "B00018U8YE", "B0012OX7EO", "1935850024", "B002W1HBM0", "B002SF9YNO", "B0002S64SM", "B001T46TCO", "B000R8YC22", "B0087OULO6", "B0012Z361M", "B005M9VSNC", "B002VRNJT4", "6305257442", "B000M2E34K", "B0007Z9QSA", "B000EHQ7JC", "B0000DGKI7", "9622178081", "B001RXDM36", "1594851123", "B00DEKKEPO", "B0016MLIK2", "B00065GVIY", "B0000WN13Q", "B0007UDC80", "B000VWYJ6S", "B009NP1ZVG", "B001CCY42U", "0937321052", "B00FNM3L7E", "B001J697BC", "B000Y38OCY", "B000BB1534", "0767853512", "B00005QFE5", "B000KX0IOA", "B0009PW3RO", "B0084O26SI", "B005U0ZP46", "B001AZJKKK", "B000GIXE86", "B000127YXI", "B001EP8EOY", "0143115146", "B0002HODE0", "B00A429YF6", "B000A0GY28", "B000ADS6DA", "0609809644", "B00080Z53O", "B0009GX1EM", "B0025KW1O6", "B000AP04GK", "B0015OKWKI", "B004CJQVQC", "B009NI2XVO", "B000CMNJF4", "B000FTCLQW", "B008220AGC", "B000RPCJPC", "B002ZTQV8Y", "B005LAIIHG", "B009RWRIKM"], "bought_together": ["B000KHX70S", "B000065V3Z"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000KHX70S", "B000065V3Z", "B002U4F5W2", "B00004VVO5"]}, "price": 39.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 19489}, "asin": "B0006FFRB6", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51TVYD33ABL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Story of the Weeping Camel"}

{"description": "The remarkable first season ofDeadwoodrepresents one of those periodic, wholesale reinventions of the Western that is as different from, say,Lonesome Doveas that miniseries is from Howard Hawks'sRio Bravoor the latter is from Anthony Mann'sThe Naked Spur. In many ways, HBO'sDeadwoodembraces the Western's unambiguous morality during the cinema's silent era through the 1930s while also blazing trails through a post-NYPD Blue, post-The West Wingtelevision age exalting dense and customized dialogue. On top of that,Deadwoodhas managed an original look and texture for a familiar genre: gritty, chaotic, and surging with both dark and hopeful energy. Yet the show's creator, erstwhileNYPD Bluehead writer David Milch, never ridicules or condescends to his more grasping, futile characters or overstates the virtues of his heroic ones.Set in an ungoverned stretch of South Dakota soon after the 1876 Custer massacre,Deadwoodconcerns a lawless, evolving town attracting fortune-seekers, drifters, tyrants, and burned-out adventurers searching for a card game and a place to die. Others, particularly women trapped in prostitution, sundry do-gooders, and hangers-on have nowhere else to go. Into this pool of aspiration and nightmare arrive former Montana lawman Seth Bullock (Timothy Olyphant) and his friend Sol Starr (John Hawkes), determined to open a lucrative hardware business. Over time, their paths cross with a weary but still formidable Wild Bill Hickok (Keith Carradine) and his doting companion, the coarse angel Calamity Jane (Robin Weigert); an aristocratic, drug-addicted widow (Molly Parker) trying to salvage a gold mining claim; and a despondent hooker (Paula Malcomson) who cares, briefly, for an orphaned girl. Casting a giant shadow over all is a blood-soaked king, Gem Saloon owner Al Swearengen (Ian McShane), possibly the best, most complex, and mesmerizing villain seen on TV in years.  Over 12 episodes, each of these characters, and many others, will forge alliances and feuds, cope with disasters (such as smallpox), and move--almost invisibly but inexorably--toward some semblance of order and common cause. Making it all worthwhile is Milch's masterful dialogue--often profane, sometimes courtly and civilized, never perfunctory--and the brilliant acting of the aforementioned performers plus Brad Dourif, Leon Rippy, Powers Boothe, and Kim Dickens.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000EULSR0", "B000NVI2GU", "B0038M2APA", "B0075FF5QM", "B007A2Z3Y4", "B00B5J6A7W", "B004HW7JNS", "B00CG4XKNM", "B004BZ5AHI", "B00EAPC860", "B00HUCF420", "B00A2JOQMW", "B003Y5HWJU", "B008PJZDXW", "B0028RXXE8", "B00076YPUI", "B00HT850YW", "B00CDTSFF8", "B00J5LXT44", "B00BFAIH68", "B00G4RDQK4", "B002UJIY7A", "1596912391", "B00BC5I6Q2", "B00316DDUO", "B00C8CQRQ4", "B00ECGHM5O", "B000K2V7E6", "B0090XO59U", "B00EIXWW2O", "B005LAJ1H2", "B00HW3EXCE", "B00EEDNR9A", "B0012RLX88", "B00EUI4XHE", "B004QRUN96", "B00J5G1P2W", "B00003CXOP", "B00AATGDUC", "B00IARA8KM", "B009LDD54K", "B000PGTPH8", "B008CLI4N4", "B008V9HKF0", "B00ATP24V4", "6305504024", "B002N57KGM", "B005HAAZLC", "B00G0B7PTW", "B001TH8ZH8", "B000059H7K", "080328702X", "B001FA1OTU", "B0051GOB2G", "B00BVMXBDO", "B0060MYKYY", "B00911L7VA", "B00BQ42Q38", "B00GWJIDFW", "B001DJLCRC", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B0002ERXC2", "B000VWX6T4", "B008BLCP0S", "B00FEP9MYG", "B00GAHJO8G", "B00793J278", "B0002J4X2K", "B00005JL3K", "B00J4LMHMK", "B000YABIQ6", "6304711905", "B0058YPG1G", "B001FB4W0W", "B003PIUBZS", "B00DJYJRHG", "B004HW7JO2", "B001RTSPVY", "B00HEPE6MM", "B00CL151G4", "B00005NOHO", "B0024FAR5M", "B00AYNG9BC", "B0032UYFA6", "B009ERK2UI", "B000BO7DWI", "B000F1IQI2", "B00915G6WQ", "B0081QF6Q8", "B00B5J5YJM", "B00IWTVDUW", "B006MK4QKW", "B00ECHBSP8", "B009LDD1H6", "B0012CJQYQ", "B00BGI076M", "B001GCUER0", "B002FLOTPE", "B005FISBTO", "B0032JTV6A"], "bought_together": ["B000EULSR0", "B000NVI2GU"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001FA1OTU", "B000EULSR0", "B0038M2APA", "B000NVI2GU"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 6874}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 34.99, "brand": "Warner Bros", "asin": "B0006FO5LO", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61KQUt8dAdL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Deadwood: Season 1"}
{"description": "Playing the president's kin in the modern fairy taleFirst Daughteris the most grown-up role yet forDawson's Creekcutie Katie Holmes.  Samantha McKenzie (Holmes) has lived all her life on the edge of the political spotlight, but she hopes that she'll get away from it all when she leaves the White House for college.  No such luck.  Even though she's able to make friends with her roommate (singer Amerie) and meet a nice guy (Marc Blucas), security is tight in an election year, and the Secret Service follows her wherever she goes.First Daughterisn't particularly original (it was the working title for Mandy Moore'sChasing Liberty, which opened in theaters earlier the same year, 2004), but it's a chuckle-inducing girlie movie that's worth watching for Holmes.  Also, Michael Keaton is especially likable as a president and dad.  That's a big change for Holmes, who asDawson's Creek's Joey Potter was a poster child for daughters with dysfunctional fathers.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000P0J08S", "B00AEFYWQY", "B000RETOGA", "B002WNU0OY", "B002WNU0QM", "B002GOAH1U", "B00BNAE6M4", "B0035JHYNO", "B009INAC12", "B0013K2ZFY", "B008U1ANHG", "B004CYVZ4K", "B001AR012O", "B0032LV4NG", "B00465I14M", "B000CDSS0Y", "B00A4Y61ZU", "B00A4Y60P6", "B009INAK8C", "B00FOLGW48", "B00DNF1RM4", "B00E0KWBE4", "B00BCMSXOK", "B00JRE9TBG", "B00ANV82HE", "B006X08DZ0", "B002SAMMF6", "B0099116S6", "B000CCBCAI", "B00HRYH6F4", "B00F9IMX6W", "B00GSTHC7G", "B00AZL30H4", "B000CGXLTE", "B00IYRLUAU", "B00F9IMXBC", "B008IG0D00", "B005ELVCS4", "B00HRUQ9BA", "B00HRUQ8HK", "B000S0SYIM", "B004R67RC2", "B00CAYH23M", "B0010X5X4O", "B000AJJMXM", "B008K1PY5M", "B00IYRLURI", "B000TGUUFA", "B008R5SZZM", "B0082SINT2", "B00DNF1S28", "B0026RX2VE", "B00A4Y62K4", "B00AEBB8R4", "B002AL2TYC", "B00EOHGQPI", "B000PFUBKY", "B004H9ZQ4U", "B00GST8LMG", "B000WM4R2I", "B000324Y98", "B00DCG36LO", "B00006HAYQ", "B008IG0DJQ", "B002WY65V0", "B00F9IMX7G", "B000E1YW2W", "B00KSON3L6", "B0077PBPTG", "B00795C5X4", "B005K1VPY4", "B0000ZMGZW", "B000J4QW7W", "B0038N9X3Q", "B0032LV4KY", "B00DCG3696", "B00F9IMX8U", "B00006ZXSK", "B004EPZ070", "B003Y5H52O", "B003NHRIVQ", "B003YOZNGK", "B004K4FU9S", "B00063KGPU", "B00FL2F2VY", "B002ZG989G", "B002ZG988M", "B0009OL7Z4", "B0036K9CIM", "B000QUU7KC", "B002UJIY1G", "B00080Z692", "6305907110", "B001ECDVK4", "B00GV8AZI2", "B00005JPSM", "B00J49R1BY", "B005GP7ESA", "B004SIP9X8", "B005N4DNDY"], "bought_together": ["B00AEFYWQY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AEFYWQY", "B002WNU0QM", "B0032LV4NG", "B00A4Y60P6"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 10872}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.5, "brand": "20th Century Fox", "asin": "B0006GAOCW", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516lsu0EkHL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "First Daughter"}
{"description": "John Sayles tackles one of his most provocative projects inSilver City, a broadside on politics and campaigning. It's one of Sayles's multi-character tapestries, set during a tarnished governor's race in Colorado. Chris Cooper has kicky fun as a feather-brained candidate, whose nonsensical speeches deliberately evoke the 43rd U.S. president. He doesn't get nearly enough screen time, because the film follows a burned-out private detective (the awkward Danny Huston) as he tugs at conspiracies. Sayles's understanding of the connected relationships in the political world is keen, and his malignant ending scores points--though the issues are more convincing than the characters. A subplot romance between Huston and journalist Maria Bello is tired, and there's a rushed quality that undercuts the political barbs. The crowded cast helps it perk along. This is a companion piece to Sayles'sCity of HopeandSunshine State, and proves his teeth are only getting sharper.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00002E20R", "B0017M9ZNI", "B0019UGY96", "B0000AMU29", "B000068QP0", "B00006L926", "B0010YSD90", "0767821432", "B00009Y3N3", "B00004TJKJ", "B0001EQIF6", "0767838440", "B00009Y3N0", "B00009Y3N1", "0790731460", "B000UNYJXQ", "B0024FAG2Q", "B00049QJ9I", "B005FITIGO"], "bought_together": ["B00002E20R"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00002E20R", "B007J3ISL4", "B000068QP0", "B0019UGY96"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 223877}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.58, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B0006GVJEO", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5168C4TJGNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Silver City"}

{"description": "The long-awaited emergence ofNightmare Alleyinto the light of DVD should achieve two things: make a legendary film noir available to a new generation, and restore the horrific charge to the lately watered-down termgeek, a concept that once had the power to give people very bad dreams indeed.To his lasting credit, Tyrone Power--20th Century Fox's extraordinarily handsome but not terribly interesting star of the '30s and '40s--begged for the chance to play Stan Carlisle, the predatory charmer who snakes his way through this bracingly unwholesome story. A spieler for--and lover of--carnival mind reader Zeena (Joan Blondell), he displays uncanny skill at \"reading\" the susceptible rubes, including a tough sheriff who turns to jelly after Stan psychs him out. Once Stan's mastered the intricate code used in Zeena's act, he's set to dump her for the younger, sexier Molly (Coleen Gray) and go bigtime as nightclub psychic \"Stanton the Great.\" After that, it's only a blasphemous bank shot to superstardom as a miracle worker with his own tabernacle and radio show.Few '40s films ventured as deeply into cynicism asNightmare Alley, or dealt so frankly with sexuality (with ripplings of polymorphous perversity yet) and power-tripping. The movie's rhythm is uncertain and Jules Furthman's screenplay telegraphs things, but the overall tone is remarkable, as are individual sequences: the freaky forced marriage of Stan and Molly in accordance with carny morality, and a creepy night scene in a park when Stanton the Great raises a ghost for a high-society client. Cinematographer Lee Garmes's chiaroscuro creates a relief map of the carnival world and what passes for life there. As for the geek... well, you'll find out whatgeekmeans. Stan does.--Richard T.

{"description": "American detectives are usually played by tough guys and busty babes, but the British have more esoteric tastes: The sleuths ofRosemary & Thymeare a pair of middle-aged ladies with a horticulture business.  Rosemary Boxer (Felicity Kendal, star of the classic BritcomGood Neighbors), a former academic, teamed up with new divorcee (and former policewoman) Laura Thyme (Pam Ferris,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban) over a murder case involving poisonous weeds and oozing red sap--plants and murder have been intertwined ever since. A dying lawn leads to a pretty Polish blonde pushed from a roof; while Rosemary tosses off tidbits about Victorian gardening techniques and the Latin name for the early spider orchid, the bones of a buried racehorse reveal other secrets. In one clever episode, flowers are the murder weapon themselves (though to say how would spoil the fun). Some mystery aficionados may findRosemary & Thymea bit abrupt; the hour-long format doesn't allow for the elegant unfolding and deft misdirection of an Agatha Christie adaptation. But the interplay between rambunctious Rosemary and pragmatic Laura is addictive, and the suggestion--spoken aloud in one episode, but underlying the entire series--that English flora respond to the evil deeds of humankind lends an almost metaphysical air to the pair's dual pursuits.  Gardening fans will also appreciate the many lovely gardens, which the series lovingly displays.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000E0OBEC", "B000K7UEMC", "B005DVIPY4", "B00007KLE8", "B004HHX9H8", "B0009S4IN8", "B0050N0US4", "B00ANGIAU8", "B00CEBJCF2", "B00KHA9BQ2", "B000O7860A", "B001O4C6MQ", "B00HUAGYF8", "B0007Y3XRG", "1569385882", "B0038M2S2A", "B00H4ZEFTQ", "B000K7UBUM", "B00ANGIBV6", "B0028LOT7O", "B00A27O5AW", "B001V7YZHA", "B00FPPQYXM", "B00BEZEDNU", "B002TY78OQ", "B001O4C6NA", "B007ISJS0U", "B001JXPC64", "B0002HODEK", "B000NVKZVK", "B006MK4QKW", "B0000C2IQI", "B002OMGVPU", "B00GAXASK8", "B000R349JI", "B00HGE90Z4", "B005X5XINI", "B008OTTTP6", "B001B43IUS", "B006MK5YUI", "B00D49YE4W", "B00287Z19I", "B009DS6YGO", "B005GP7EVC", "B0001DHSBU", "B00A8KJLPM", "B00D7AM2V0", "B00BCXW106", "B00C888LOO", "B005A1GS00", "B00HHYF55C", "B006JY3OBI", "B002MUAXIA", "B005K8QIS0", "B00A0HT99G", "B00GAHJO8G", "B001JXPC3M", "B001V7YZAM", "B001V7YZD4", "B00GHH9IP8", "B007V4QLWE", "B002G3DTSE", "B0019QOKSM", "B007A2O3FO", "B001B43IV2", "B000A6T1X6", "B008RO6PJQ", "B00F1BFRA6", "B00BC0JGUW", "B00AATGDUC", "B000XUF6C4", "B009DS31ZG", "B001V7YZA2", "B0001WTUK8", "B0006212JK", "B002RB56YA", "B0028AENSK", "B009DS3VQA", "B00005JN8S", "B008CYDDRS", "B004132HZS", "B006CR2OWM", "B00BFAIH68", "B0081QF6QS", "B0093I913W", "B00EJ1IT4A", "B007T40GOK", "B004QOB8SO", "B000KGH00W"], "bought_together": ["B000E0OBEC", "B000K7UEMC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005DVIPY4", "B004HHX9H8", "B000WCN7M4", "B000E0OBEC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 87194}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 52.99, "brand": "", "asin": "B00080ZG3S", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51V7N9Y71AL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Rosemary &amp; Thyme - Series One"}

{"description": "Will Smith's easygoing charm makesHitchthe kind of pleasant, uplifting romantic comedy that you could recommend to almost anyone--especially if there's romance in the air. As suave Manhattan dating consultant Alex \"Hitch\" Hitchens, Smith plays up the smoother, sophisticated side of his established screen persona as he mentors a pudgy accountant (Kevin James) on the lessons of love. The joke, of course, is that Hitch's own love life is a mess, and as he coaches James toward romance with a rich, powerful, and seemingly inaccessible beauty named Allegra (Amber Valetta), he's trying too hard to impress a savvy gossip columnist (Eva Mendes) with whom he's fallen in love. Through mistaken identities and mismatched couples, director Andy Tennant brings the same light touch that made Drew Barrymore'sEver Afterso effortlessly engaging. As romantic comedies go,Hitchdoesn't offer any big surprises, but as a date movie it gets the job done with amiable ease and style.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0009RCPUW", "B001QERPAC", "B0013J55B6", "B000N6U0E2", "B0001Z3TXE", "B00005JN0T", "B0013FDM7E", "B00AEFY99O", "B003Y5H4ZW", "B000VXWX7E", "B002K0WBXW", "B000803BQC", "B000BKVQS4", "B000HT386M", "B003Y5H574", "0800141741", "6305428115", "B00007E2F5", "B00005JMW7", "B00AEBB9WI", "B00008G8M4", "B002VECM6S", "B000LC3ICE", "B000ELJAEM", "B00003CXSM", "B004EPZ0BG", "B00AEBB8NS", "076780421X", "B00164KYV4", "B00AEFY0F2", "B003Y5H524", "B000VG66XS", "B00008WJD6", "B00AEFXWXI", "B002ZG998G", "B002ZG989G", "B000YDBPAM", "B000CEV3KU", "B00005JPE3", "B000AP04FG", "B00005JLQN", "B001C5LLQ4", "B00003CXO1", "B002P413IC", "B0001AVZA8", "B0012KJ0DK", "B0015I2RT8", "B000E6EHE0", "B001NPD9RM", "B00008VFCA", "B00006ZXSL", "B000FGGWGK", "B000098XQ8", "B001OQCUZM", "B000MQC9H4", "B00005JN3W", "B00005IBN0", "B003BV8ICC", "B00006FMUW", "B001SN78JO", "B000RBA6C4", "B0009UZGIM", "B001GKJ2E8", "B00005JNTU", "B000ZBEOEC", "B00AEFY4CG", "B0000B1OFL", "B008RNYMG0", "B0038N9WKU", "B0021L8UYY", "B000683VI4", "6304765266", "B000TZJBPQ", "B00005JLSB", "B0007PLLBU", "B000059TG6", "B002ZG9968", "B003EYVXXC", "B0000897EG", "B00005JM4Q", "B004IK30MI", "B00081U7HC", "B002ZG97B0", "B000P0J0EW", "B00005O5CM", "B005F2JRUC", "B000ASDFGI", "B00005JKCH", "B0006GAI5U", "B0000AKCKI", "B001UV4XRY", "B00005JMQW", "B0010X5X4O", "B000M341QE", "B001AKTZW8", "B00024JC4E", "B00AEBB8R4", "B00005JKMQ", "B00CLSBNNM", "B005LAII2Q"], "bought_together": ["B000N6U0E2", "B001QERPAC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000N6U0E2", "B002ZG97TW", "B002VECM6S", "B000AP04FG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 105544}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.94, "brand": "SMITH,WILL", "asin": "B000957O7S", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41jGu0AHCAL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Hitch (Fullscreen Edition)"}
{"description": "Fans ofIce Princesswill enjoy seeing the five deleted scenes, even though like most DVD deleted scenes they wouldn't have added much to the film.  In fact, the alternate opening (an extended scene that flashes back to Casey's earlier childhood) and a later scene would have undesirably softened Joan Cusack's and Kim Cattrall's characters.  Some cut scenes involving Casey and her Snoplow classmates are fun.  The two music videos spotlight key songs from the soundtrack, Caleigh Peters's \"Reach\" and Ally & AJ's \"No One,\" but co-star Hayden Panettiere's \"I Fly\" is a curious omission.  The commentary track follows the Disney trend of featuring its young actors, in this case Michelle Trachtenberg (Casey), Panettiere (Gen), Trevor Blumas (Teddy), and Kirsten Olsen (Nikki, the \"Jumping Shrimp\").  Film aficionados won't learn that much about the crafting of the movie, but the kids have spirit and talk about the \"exploding butt shot\" and who already knew how to skate.  It can be a little tricky to figure which girl is speaking, though.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002WY65V0", "B004CYVZ4K", "B000CCBCAI", "B0007US7C6", "B00005JMCW", "B00063KGPU", "B0024NSFYO", "B00795C5X4", "B000059XTL", "B000FCW15A", "B003B1X85O", "B00005JM9Q", "B00404ME2Y", "B0006SSMWE", "B000209KMW", "B003Y5H52O", "B001B7CO0K", "6305870179", "B000F48D5A", "B004SIP75S", "B00AEFYWQY", "B006X08DZ0", "B000AM4P9A", "B000H5V8CW", "B000324Y98", "B004QIG7CW", "B0001Z3HIG", "B001725ZD2", "B001R3YRIU", "B007I8KXDQ", "B0007LXPBI", "B000B2YR92", "B00005JPO4", "B00062IVN0", "B000ICM5SU", "B0009DWL8W", "B000VAPZM2", "B003PGNBNY", "B0007LXPBS", "B006JTS6XY", "B001KX50B0", "B001NE80P4", "B002WNU0QM", "B000FVQM4W", "B002WNU0OY", "044047731X", "B001G2S3Y6", "B000Y9PC7S", "B002GOAH1U", "B001GC9VK6", "B00GOITWRE", "B0007Z9R66", "B000F2BNW2", "B000JMK6OO", "B007DBGS4G", "B00005JN0Z", "B001FCD252", "B002BIULQ2", "B004IZVMXM", "B000CDSS0Y", "B0006GAOCW", "B00005JMXO", "6305428387", "B0009HLBQQ", "B0007Z9R5W", "B00004Y7D2", "B0013ND3MK", "B00005V9I9", "B004FXQYG2", "B00FKXBECU", "B001H1I8KK", "B000LXHFNG", "B001AR012O", "B001TUZD8O", "B000065V42", "B005EJIG62", "B004FJ87EI", "B000MBUXEA", "B00ANV82HE", "B000JFY05W", "B003NHRIVQ"], "bought_together": ["B000CCBCAI", "B004CYVZ4K"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001S3C0M4", "B000CCBCAI", "B00005JMCW", "B000FCW15A"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 22973}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.99, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B0009JE57G", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ESDWWN2SL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Ice Princess (Full Screen Edition)"}

{"description": "As filmmaker and cultural anthropologist, Werner Herzog brings his unique powers of observation to Buddhist rituals inWheel of Time. The documentary's title refers to the central symbol that forms the physical and spiritual hub of an intricately detailed sand mandala that is the centerpiece of the Kalachakra initiation, a Buddhist ceremony that attracts several hundred thousand monks and pilgrims to Bodh Gaya, India (the original site of the Buddha's enlightenment) in 2002. Through well-chosen images and his own sparse but effective narration, Herzog chronicles this spiritual conclave, incorporating brief interview clips with His Holiness, the Dalai Lama, a lively debate between high-level monks at the gathering, an interview with a Tibetan political prisoner who'd spent 37 years in jail, and a visit to the sacred Mount Kailash in Tibet, where the faithful endure a high-altitude 52-kilometer trek to worship on holy ground. Having recovered from illness that prevented his full participation in the Bodh Gaya ceremony, the Dalai Lama appears at another Buddhist ceremony in Graz, Austria, where another sand mandala symbolizes the deep significance of Buddhist inner peace. Herzog's fascination with these rituals is infectious, and with a powerful soundtrack of Tibetan music and Buddhist monks' chanting,Wheel of Timeachieves its own quiet quality of grace.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002MZCSW4", "B0002J4X20", "B000WMEB1A", "B000ARG2RI", "B00B2MJAXS", "B00AXYZZ6C", "B000U788UM", "B000AQ68XC", "B000EPFTY8", "B004PWCPPW", "B000IJ7AJC", "B0007ZKGNO", "0861711998"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000R7HY3M", "B000U788UM", "B002CO78ZM", "B000S76VHQ"]}, "price": 16.02, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 150999}, "asin": "B000AQ68Y6", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51X3WNQKWDL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Wheel of Time"}

{"description": "One of the best mystery tales of all time,The Moonstone, based on Wilkie Collins' 1868 novel, is the story of a stolen Hindu diamond that makes its way into the care of Franklin Blake (Greg Wise ofSense and Sensibility). Acting as executor of the estate of the late Colonel John Herncastle (Terrence Hardiman), Franklin is obliged to deliver the diamond, called the Moonstone, to Herncastle's niece, Rachel Verinder (Keeley Hawes ofTipping the Velvet). The two fall in love, but after the disappearance of the Moonstone, Rachel refuses to speak to Franklin or anyone else, and rebuffs an investigation by a renowned detective (Antony Sher), who suspects Rachel herself is involved with the apparent theft. The long trail to the truth is endlessly surprising, requiring the participation of a number of fascinating characters who each contribute something to the solution. A handsome production directed by Robert Bierman (Vampire's Kiss),The Moonstoneis most entertaining whenever Sher is on screen, humming incessantly, prattling on about roses, and sharing scenes with such estimable supporting players as Patricia Hodge (Betrayal) and Peter Vaughan (The Remains of the Day).--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0009OL92K", "B0009PVZM8", "B001EJZNDU", "B000GAKFI6", "B000E0ODZE", "B00005JOA0", "B00HUAGYF8", "B000NIBUP8", "B0001WTUJO", "0486424510", "B00062IZ0Y", "B0077PBPVE", "B00I6JODGO", "B00BOTCJXC", "B000EBD9VC", "0140434119", "B00HUAGZ34", "B000FL7CBY", "B000Z27HLS", "B001P807RC", "B000GIXLUC", "B000089QEM", "B007A2O3FO", "B0031RAP5O", "B008RO6PJQ", "B0009PVZKU", "B000M2E32M", "B000A8AXXG", "B004XVMCMQ", "B00C888LOO", "B00A27OJ94", "B000AYEL6U", "B00CEBJC20", "B00D49YFAA", "B0011KQSZ4", "B0077PBPJ6", "B001H9JBW6", "B00H4ZEFTQ", "B000FFJYA2", "B001PU8MZO", "B000784WNQ", "B006JY3OH2", "B006P0FIGU", "B00065GX96", "B008OTTTP6", "B0090XUARQ", "B001AXL67W", "B001PU8N0I", "B008220C38", "B000Z27HMW", "B00005YUNK", "0199556113", "B0080QOL10", "B00D49YEHO", "B00AF82WTO", "B00E3UN44W", "B003UD7J94", "B006H3KQOE", "B00HGE90Z4", "B00F1BFRA6", "B004JMSIQS", "B004132HZS", "B000LPQ6DE", "B000LXHK2C", "B000LW7L1I", "B0007TKOGE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000GAKFI6", "B0009OL92K", "B0007LFPJ8", "B0077PBPVE"]}, "price": 35.71, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 53441}, "asin": "B000AYELC4", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51W8XTNEJ8L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Moonstone"}

{"description": "With Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson as a pair of brazen wedding crashers, this buddy/romantic comedy milks a few big laughs from its foolproof premise. Under the direction of David Dobkin (who previously worked with Wilson onShanghai Knights), the movie ranges from bawdy romp to mushy romance, and that tonal identity crisis curtails the overall hilarity. But when the well-teamed costars are firing on all pistons with fast-paced dialogue and manic situations, belly laughs are delivered at a steady clip. Things get complicated when the guys infiltrate the family of the Treasury Secretary (Christopher Walken), resulting in a romantic pair-off between Vaughn and the congressman's oversexed daughter Gloria (Isla Fisher) while Wilson sincerely woos another daughter, Claire (Rachel McAdams), who's unhappily engaged to an Ivy League cheater (Bradley Cooper). Walken is more or less wasted in his role, but Jane Seymour and Henry Gibson make amusing appearances, and a surprise guest arrives late in the game for some over-the-top scene-stealing. It's all a bit uneven, but McAdams (considered by some to be \"the next Julia Roberts\") is a pure delight, and with enough laughs to make it easily recommended,Wedding Crasherswill likely find its place on DVD shelves alongside other flawed but enjoyable R-rated comedies that embrace a naughtier, nastier brand of humor with no need for apologies.--Jeff ShannonVince Vaughn's MoviesWhy We Love Rachel McAdamsOwen Wilson's MoviesThe SoundtrackThe Return of Crass ComedyThe 40-Year-Old Virgin", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEFYS2M", "B000ELJAEM", "B00466HN7M", "B008R65XNS", "B00005JNZU", "B00006FMUW", "B000J4P9P8", "B002ZGW92E", "B001G5T6GW", "B000WZEZGI", "B002Q4VBPQ", "B00003CXSM", "B001TUZD8O", "B000HCPS94", "B001C0JCBA", "B0009HBPN0", "B001OD4S50", "B00005JMYI", "B00005JG6N", "B004EPZ084", "B0015I2RT8", "B00AEFYAMA", "B00AEBB8NS", "B00AEFXJS6", "B000069CF0", "B000TZJBPQ", "B00003CXO1", "B001C5LLQ4", "B0009OL7Z4", "B0007RT9M6", "B00005JMW7", "B001J9KJ4I", "B0006GANPA", "B003Y5H574", "B000BKJ762", "B000E6EHE0", "B003Y5H524", "B000ICM5X0", "B00AEFY7I2", "B002K0WBXW", "B00AEBB9K0", "B000VXWX7E", "B0013D8LHC", "B004HO6I2E", "B001DPHDB0", "B0016MOV92", "B00AEFYM2S", "B004EPZ070", "B000JJ4DNW", "B003CRM6PA", "B00BEIYMZ6", "B008R65XMO", "B00005JMX6", "B00AEBBA2C", "B004EPZ06G", "B004EPYZS0", "B003Y5H5B0", "B00024JC4E", "B0000AKCKI", "B000957O82", "B00AEFYQE2", "B00DV2MVWO", "B00AEBB8FQ", "B001L9EXTS", "B0041KKYGU", "B00AEFZ3XU", "B002U4UYZA", "B000CPH9PM", "B000EMGJAO", "B000M341QE", "B008R65XUQ", "B00005JMCT", "B001AKTZW8", "B00008WJD6", "B00AEFYSL8", "B002P413IC", "B00AEFXVW0", "B002ZG99H2", "B0000A02TZ", "B005LAII12", "B001SN78JO", "B008JFUORW", "B000LC3ICE", "B002T9H2LA", "B0051MKNRC", "B003HKN52U", "B000CCBCAS", "B00AEFYZCU", "B002ZG980U", "B00AEFY99O", "B002VWNIEA", "B0000524E5", "B004AV5GX6", "B000A343RI", "B000EMGJ7C", "B004LWZW5G", "B00AEFXDO6", "B00000K3UU", "B004SIP95G", "B0009RCPUW"], "bought_together": ["B00AEFYS2M"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00466HN7M", "B001G5T6GW", "B003Y5H5B0", "B000J4P9P8"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 92528}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.95, "brand": "New Line Home Video", "asin": "B000BKVQRU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Z2E7093FL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Wedding Crashers (R-Rated Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "Blockbuster action director Michael Bay delivers a striking look at a strange world of the future in this sci-fi action drama. Midway through the 21st century, Lincoln Six Echo (Ewan McGregor) lives in a confined indoor community after ongoing abuse of the Earth has rendered most of the planet uninhabitable. One of the only places in the outside world still capable of sustaining life is an idyllic island where citizens are chosen to live through a lottery. Or at least that's what Lincoln and his fellow citizens are taught to believe; the truth is that Lincoln, like everyone he knows, is actually a clone who is kept under wraps to provide needed organs when the person who supplied his or her DNA falls ill. When he becomes aware that his existence is a fraud, Lincoln escapes to the outside world with a fellow clone, Jordan Two Delta (Scarlett Johansson), though the powers that be are determined to see that no one gets away alive.The Islandalso stars Steve Buscemi, Djimon Hounsou, Michael Clarke Duncan, and Sean Bean.", "related": {"also_bought": ["0767805712", "B002UZCJ8Y", "B0069UP2PI", "B00005JL78", "B0013PSTMC", "B004LWZW7E", "B004XQO90O", "B008JFUO36", "B000TGJ8CQ", "B00AEFXCLU", "B001GCUO02", "B0001NBNDY", "B002GIBVVG", "B00KHWSB5M", "B0018O4YT0", "B00005JLWN", "B0001CNRAM", "B002ZG98SW", "B00005JN0T", "B00K7IPFSM", "B00JPFTX5O", "B0009YA3OA", "B001CC7PLM", "B000AP04FG", "B005LAIIMG", "B005LAII8A", "B0013LL2Z2", "B002ZG980U", "B008JFUN50", "B00005JMWP", "B000EQHXNW", "B004WCTLNY", "B004EPYZOO", "B001GKJ2E8", "B007R6DJP8", "B00AEFXSLE", "B00AKGG8I2", "B000EZ908Y", "B00AIBZMD6", "B00BEIYIF0", "B0045HCJ8A", "B004LWZW4M", "B000BVM1S2", "B0067EKYAY", "B00AEBB8NI", "B001FB55HQ", "B00005JPAR", "B004LWZW42", "B001VLBDD0", "B0062P3392", "B000FS9FCG", "B008JFUPFI", "B00IKM5MIA", "B004A8ZX28", "B000056PMU", "B00005JPD0", "B005COLETU", "B003Q6D2B4", "B004EPYZSK", "B000P0J0EW", "B009AMAJPA", "B002SG7Z7A", "B00H83EUQW", "B000LC55F2", "B00DWZHTOU", "B005NKIPUY", "B005LAIHPE", "B000A2IPQY", "B00AEBB89W", "B0051MKNV8", "B005LAIIPS", "B001EAWMGA", "B00A7MSQRK", "6304711891", "B000QQJ3Q0", "B002GHHHOC", "B0021L8V0M", "B000P0I4O4", "B0013FDM7E", "B00AS1Q93S", "B00004XPPG", "B0045HCJFS", "B003UYUQZW", "B001OQCVI8", "B003QO8TOQ", "B00096S49Y", "B005LAIGRS", "B000EGDB10", "B002ZG984Q", "B000FGGE68", "B003L20IG0", "B0036TGSR6", "B0045HCJGC", "B002DU39GW", "B0002KVUKM", "B008JFUQZ2", "B000H30B2C", "0767803434", "B00AEBB8QK"], "bought_together": ["0767805712", "B0069UP2PI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004WCTLNY", "B004XQO90O", "B00JJ3EHCG", "B004SBQAN8"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 95555}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.44, "brand": "Dreamworks Skg", "asin": "B000BO0LH2", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5133H8SZ04L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Island"}

{"description": "While hardcore Trekkers may not find a lot of new material inStar Trek Collective: Borg, newcomers experiencing 16 action-packed, fan-selected episodes of the Federation's greatest villains may have to prepare to be assimilated.  All the episodes have been previously released on DVD, but there are new text commentaries on three of the episodes, and the per-disc price is significantly less expensive than the full-seasonTreksets. It's a great entry point for novices, or for budget-minded fans.The episodes are presented in Stardate order, which means starting withEnterprise, the latest series but also the earliest in chronological order.  In \"Regeneration,\" an exploration team finds a pair of apparently dead humanoid-mechanical hybrids that turn out to be members of the Borg, a nearly invincible race whose simple goal is to absorb--\"assimilate\"--every individual organism it encounters into its collective being.  Because the Borg has the ability to adapt itself to resist any threat, resistance is futile.  Shift ahead toThe Next Generationand a visit by the quirky god Q turns out to have deadly implications when, in a pouty mood, he throws theEnterpriseinto their first encounter with the Borg.  That's followed by the classic two-part cliffhanger (bridging seasons 3 and 4) \"The Best of Both Worlds,\" in which Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart) is assimilated into the Borg and a frustrated Commander Riker (Jonathan Frakes) has to make a fateful decision. \"I, Borg\" attempts to give the Borg a humanized aspect, and the two-parter \"Descent\" has some interesting developments for Data (Brent Spiner).  SkipDeep Space Ninein favor ofVoyager, the series in which Captain Janeway's (Kate Mulgrew) ship is stranded far from home in the Delta Quadrant.  That happens to be home turf for the Borg, so they had a number of run-ins.  The first two-parter (which bridged seasons 3 and 4) is \"Scorpion,\" which introduces the Borg's nemesis, Species 8472.  By the time of \"Drone,\" the ship had its first Borg crew member, the sexy Seven of Nine (Jeri Ryan), but her loyalties are tempted by the Borg Queen (Susanna Thompson) in the double-length \"Dark Frontier.\" In the \"Unimatrix Zero\" two-parter, which bridged seasons 6 and 7, Seven discovers an idyllic haven for members of the Collective that the Queen is determined to find and destroy.  That eventually leads to an ultimate confrontation with the Queen (now played by Alice Krige, repeating her role fromStar Trek: First Contact) in the series finale, \"Endgame.\"--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000ERVJJ0", "B000CSUNLQ", "B000FEBWTY", "B001AII4RC", "B000P5FH44", "B002I9Z8EO", "B002MU4NM2", "B001TH16CO", "B001TH16CE", "B002MU4NLS", "B002I9Z8G2", "B00IUR3YI0", "B00005JLRT", "B000127LW2", "B00023P4F6", "B002I9Z8GM", "B00005JKHP", "6305181721", "B00000ILBK", "B0001NBNFW", "B00BAXTY8U", "B0007TKH66", "B00062IDCO", "B000HEWEJ4", "B0002WZTCA", "B00062IDLA", "B00DB97LRC", "B000228EBS", "B0002JP4GE", "B0064NLQYG", "B00D3XM3MY", "B002I9Z8GW", "B000AOEMXC", "B0000AUHOH", "B002I9Z8AS", "B005DEUEV8", "B002I9Z8I0", "B00BAXTYIA", "B00005Y1NF", "B00CTSDDVO", "B0000UJL96", "B002I9Z8BM", "1451657242", "B002HWRYJE", "B0009I7NGW", "B00BAXTYF8", "B00AZMFJYA", "146540337X", "B00008WFTU", "B001L9VTMW", "B002KX9CPO", "B00471JSRE", "B001DHXT6G", "B00404ME2E", "B0000UJLVY", "B006LPHY6G", "B00062RCC6", "6305910537", "B001B8TKFG", "B002PQ7JQK", "B0002MHDW4", "B00D9EJFZA", "B0000844IH", "B002KPINY8", "B00ENFS0GY", "B007USBGSA", "B001AR0D40", "145166818X", "B001LQQJ66", "B000VDDDY6", "B004BZ5AMI", "B000F8O2Q0", "B00008KA57", "B000031EGW", "0792160959", "B000062XFG", "B001AQO3XS", "B00005V5NQ", "B00CLA3Y2I", "B0017VG69U", "B00008KA58", "B00AO1RKW6", "B004EXWGJW", "B00HERGM86", "B002I9Z8DK", "B000RXVNDI", "B00022FWEU", "B0037QGS0K", "B001TH16DI", "B0083TUEHY", "B000A6CLL0", "B004EXWGHY", "B00AEBB8VK", "B0009JE6G6", "B0011FLGZQ", "B0011FLH00", "B00480OC0C", "B003HKN548", "B00A2H9OSK", "B00FEOYY8G"], "bought_together": ["B000ERVJJ0", "B000FEBWTY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000ERVJJ0", "B001AII4RC", "6305127638", "B000P5FH44"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 49941}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 18.99, "brand": "Paramount", "asin": "B000CCBCIA", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41UmpxNAJBL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Star Trek Fan Collective - Borg"}
{"description": "Based on her own childhood, George Eliot'sThe Mill on the Flossgets the deluxe treatment in this eight-part BBC miniseries. Set in 19th century Lincolnshire, the story centers on Maggie Tulliver (Georgia Slowe). Headstrong and undisciplined, she loves her brother Tom (Jonathan Scott-Taylor), but he has his doubts about her. Frankly, he finds his sister exasperating. An uptight, ambitious young man, Tom can't understand why she won't act like a proper young lady. While he's off at boarding school, for instance, she forgets to feed his rabbits and they die. Well-mannered cousin Lucy Deane (Moira Durbridge) is a mutual friend and peacemaker between the two. Over the years, Phillip Wakem (Anton Lesser), another neighbor, will also enter their orbit. Alas, Mr. Tulliver (Ray Smith) and Lawyer Wakem (Philip Locke) are sworn enemies. More studious than her brother (now played by Christopher Blake), teenaged Maggie (Pippa Guard) is drawn to the bright, if hunchbacked Phillip, but her ardor doesn't run as deep as his. Either way, Tom doesn't approve--nor, as it turns out, does Mr. Wakem. Further, as the fortunes of the latter rise, the Tullivers fall so far they lose their mill. But all is not lost. Tom will keep the family afloat when he finds employment with Lucy's father, Uncle Deane (John Stratton), around the same time Lucy's suitor, Stephen Guest (John Moulder-Brown), switches his focus to Maggie. Just when it seems relations couldn't get more tangled, the mill itself provides a neat, if tragic solution. Previously brought to the BBC in 1965 with Jane Asher, this fine, if somewhat stagy production was followed by a 1997 telefilm with Emily Watson.--Kathleen C.

{"description": "The latest entry in theHarry Pottersaga could be retitledFast Times at Hogwarts, where finding a date to the winter ball is nearly as terrifying as worrying about Lord Voldemort's return. Thus, the young wizards' entry into puberty (and discovery of the opposite sex) opens up a rich mining field to balance out the dark content in the fourth movie (and the stories are only going to get darker). Mike Newell (Four Weddings and a Funeral) handily takes the directing reins and eases his young cast through awkward growth spurts into true young actors. Harry (Daniel Radcliffe, more sure of himself) has his first girl crush on fellow student Cho Chang (Katie Leung), and has his first big fight with best bud Ron (Rupert Grint). Meanwhile, Ron's underlying romantic tension with Hermione (Emma Watson) comes to a head over the winter ball, and when she makes one of those girl-into-woman Cinderella entrances, the boys' reactions indicate they've all crossed a threshold.But don't worry, there's plenty of wizardry and action inGoblet of Fire. When the deadly Triwizard Tournament is hosted by Hogwarts, Harry finds his name mysteriously submitted (and chosen) to compete against wizards from two neighboring academies, as well as another Hogwarts student. The competition scenes are magnificently shot, with much-improved CGI effects (particularly the underwater challenge). And the climactic confrontation with Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes, in a brilliant bit of casting) is the most thrilling yet.Goblet, the first installment to get a PG-13 rating, contains some violence as well as disturbing images for kids and some barely shrouded references at sexual awakening (Harry's bath scene in particular). The 2 1/2-hour film, lean considering it came from a 734-page book, trims out subplots about house-elves (they're not missed) and gives little screen time to the standard crew of the otherPotterfilms, but adds in more of Britain's finest actors to the cast, such as Brendan Gleeson as Mad-Eye Moody and Miranda Richardson as Rita Skeeter. Michael Gambon, in his second round as Professor Dumbledore, still hasn't brought audiences around to his interpretation of the role he took over after Richard Harris died, but it's a small smudge in an otherwise spotless adaptation.--Ellen A.

{"description": "Rent, the show that in 1996 gave voice to a Broadway generation, has finally become an energetic, passionate, and touching movie musical. Based loosely on Puccini'sLa Boh&#xE8;me, it focuses on the year in the life of a group of friends in New York's East Village--\"bohemians\" who live carefree lives of art, music, sex, and drugs. Well, carefree until Mark, an aspiring filmmaker (Anthony Rapp), and Roger, an aspiring songwriter (Adam Pascal), find out they owe a year's rent to Benny (Taye Diggs), a former friend who had promised them free residence when he married the landlord's daughter. Roger has also attracted the attention of his downstairs neighbor, Mimi (Rosario Dawson), while Mark's former girlfriend, Maureen (Idina Menzel), has found a new romance in a lawyer named Joanne (Tracie Thoms). Philosophy professor Tom (Jesse L. Martin) finds his soul mate in drag queen Angel (Wilson Jermaine Heredia). But because this is the late-'80s, the threat of AIDS is always present.The remarkable thing aboutRentthe movie is that nearly 10 years after the show debuted onBroadway, six of the eight principals return in the roles they originated. They're a bit older than would be ideal for their characters, but they do have the advantage of having learned the show directly from creator Jonathan Larson (who died of an aortic aneurysm while the show was in previews), plus they started young--we're not exactly talking Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford here.  Alongside a polished performance like Rapp's--sometimes observer-commentator, sometimes participant in two of the score's showstoppers, \"The Tango Maureen\" and \"La Vie Boheme\"--the two new additions (Thoms in place of Fredi Walker, Dawson in place of the edgier Daphne Rubin-Vega) slip comfortably into the ensemble; the pivotal Dawson makes a seductive case as Mimi when she tempts Roger in the mesmerizing \"Light My Candle\" or burns up the stage of the Catscratch Club in \"Out Tonight.\"  Moviegoers who have an aversion to people who break into song while walking down the street probably won't have their minds changed byRent(even if they are singingrocksongs), and the gritty subject matter and lack of big-name stars make it unlikely to cross over to general audiences the wayChicagodid.  But fans of musicals should find \"Seasons of Love\" as stirring as ever, and the show's passionate admirers--the \"Rentheads\"--probably couldn't have wished for a more sympathetic director thanRentfan Chris Columbus, or a more faithful representation of the show they love.--David HoriuchiOn the DVDThree powerful musical numbers cut from the final film are the highlight of the two-disc DVD.  In the aftermath of the funeral scene, Anthony Rapp sings \"Halloween,\" and he, Adam Pascal, and Rosario Dawson share \"Goodbye Love\" (both songs were in the stage version). Then in an alternate ending, the cast finishes \"No Day But Today\" on the bare stage on which the film began.  There are worthwhile arguments for why these scenes were cut or replaced, so it's fortunate that the DVD lets us see these at all.  Those musical numbers have optional commentary by director Chris Columbus, Rapp, and Pascal (two other cut scenes have no commentary), including one funny moment in which Rapp explains in great detail the technical challenge of shooting \"Halloween\" only to have Columbus say, \"Yeah, but I don't know if that's the take we used.\"  The three also provide commentary on the film itself, with Columbus discussing various decisions, criticizing the critics, and marveling \"I still don't know how we got the PG-13,\" and Rapp and Pascal occasionally recalling differences in the stage version.The other whopper of a feature isNo Day But Today, a nearly two-hour documentary that uses video clips, still photographs, and interviews with family and friends to celebrate the short life of Jonathan Larson and his creation.  Topics include his early interest in musical theater (\"I want to write theHairfor the '90s.\"), the support of Stephen Sondheim, the impact of the AIDS epidemic, the long and difficult road ofRent(casting the show, Larson learning to collaborate, the transfer to a Broadway stage, and the Rentheads), and Larson's tragic death. The last 20 minutes covers the making of the film, director Chris Columbus, the decision to rely on most of the original cast (the only two principals who didn't appear in the movie, Daphne Rubin-Vega and Fredi Walker-Browne, are interviewed in earlier segments, but only mentioned in passing here), recording sessions, and location shooting.  If the movie ofRentwas a tribute to Jonathan Larson, the DVD is all that and more, a moving and incredibly detailed look at an extraordinary talent whom the world lost far too soon.--David HoriuchiMoreRentMovie soundtrackOriginal Broadway cast recordingAnthony Rapp'sWithout You: A Memoir of Love, Loss, and the Musical \"Rent\"", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001LMAKAG", "B000AYEI4U", "B006ZZQMXS", "B000005ALT", "B004SEUJBE", "B0007TKNII", "B000077VR3", "B002D0L0R2", "0688154379", "B00AEBBAEK", "B000Z8R2VW", "B002G1K82Q", "B00GM7ZFAA", "B00JAOW3MA", "B00006D295", "B005S9EK5Y", "B0028SVXVM", "B00004XMTJ", "B001MT7ZEW", "B001GKJ2DY", "B006Z21ZFG", "6304806418", "0743269772", "B0000AM6IY", "B0000TB01Y", "B00070HK24", "B002NZK5TG", "B002ZG976U", "B00AEFY5TI", "B000EWBKMG", "B00008973A", "1423406265", "B00AEFXTKO", "B0013Z7RUC", "B00004W5VC", "B00GTO6WXU", "B000I2J6YG", "B000RPCK2E", "0800141806", "0743269764", "B00028HBIO", "0783240287", "B0007WFXZI", "0792841638", "B005QIOKBQ", "1938438175", "B005SFR7YE", "B003L77GAQ", "B001FB55OE", "B000E3LHSM", "B00001PE59", "0767827929", "B000J3OTSM", "B000UAE7NG", "B005LAIHR2", "B009NYF2GQ", "B00005JOFQ", "B002ZG99IG", "B0000VCZKM", "B00005O3VD", "B001HN69AY", "B000FIHN5M", "B0011U52E2", "B0000524E5", "B003H6Z0PO", "B006WZIB1C", "B004D9FLJE", "0061350966", "B0053O8A5K", "B001CTA1UM", "B00G5G7EXY", "B00133KFGW", "B000URDCC6", "B001LMAKAQ", "B0009JE57G", "B009LDD5E0", "B00003CYJ4", "B00001PE4D", "B005PTMPYA", "B00005OCMS", "B004VJJFDE", "B00003CXHG", "B00447L4KA", "B0002E5O9G", "B0009IOR6Q", "B001FAFO3W", "B005BUA1HQ", "B00C81AVNU", "B00004RF9K", "B00166UFSY", "B002D0L0QS", "B00AMEZDJW", "B00006RIO7", "B00FGEO7OK", "B000683VI4", "B001JV5BF8", "B00005UQ9W", "B00GB0ORJ8"], "bought_together": ["B001LMAKAG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001LMAKAG", "B000077VR3", "B004SEUIWO", "B005SFR7YE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 7679}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.86, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B000E1YVZU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61ZTKXS4AGL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Rent (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition)"}

{"description": "Any fan of Steve Martin's2000 novellawill enjoy this pitch-perfect adaptation, which glowingly captures the bittersweet tones of a May-December romance. Martin wrote the screenplay and stars as Ray Porter, a button-down 50-something executive who reaches out to a much younger woman as a Los Angeles playmate. The book and movie, though, are both primarily about Mirabelle (Claire Danes), a 20-something with a pile of promises, debt, and depression, as she fades away into a slow corner of Saks selling unneeded formal gloves. She's a wisp of a person, with a cat who doesn&#x92;t love her, and when she finds a suitor, it's Jeremy (Jason Schwartzman), a scruffy artist who babbles on about speakers. When the gentlemanly Porter calls, his appearance in her life begins to make her whole. It also immediately sets her up for sadness--Ray thinks of Mirabella as a precious outlet for sex, while Mirabelle, very mistakenly, sees Ray as a potential lifelong mate. Martin deftly turns the novella's prose into dialogue, allowing the movie to feel full-bodied, and the film also works as a comedy, as we witness Jeremy's growth on the road with a rock band. Schwartzman would walk away with film if not for the perfectly cast leads: Martin does another smart turn away from his wild-and-crazy moniker, Danes has never been better in an Oscar-worthy performance, and Bridgette Wilson-Sampras aces her role as a hot-to-trot co-worker of Mirabelle's. Whoever's decision to have Martin be the omnipresent narrator, though, should be penalized, as it&#x92;s confusing to have him in two roles, and the information is pretty useless, even robbing the film of a final grace note.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000F5FNPC", "B000F6IODE", "B000BYY11Y", "B00079HZUM", "B00008979G", "B000V6LSOA", "B003BZ58RQ", "B005Z9MH7U", "B0012BR8DI", "B0000797IO", "B000VY1EYG", "0786891076", "B000062WWZ", "B00081U7HC", "B00005JMJ4", "B004499LX0", "B00B9ZD73M", "B0016MJ6HY", "B0064MT1FI", "B000EQHXNW", "0767818105", "B00005JMWP", "B000BX8R10", "B0038N9WKU", "B000056BSJ", "1419897543", "B00ADRYCWC", "B004L3AR0K", "B002ONC9NC", "0783227353", "B000NIVJFY", "B00IKM5OCO", "B005Z9MGRG", "6305428239", "B0002KPIQY", "B000CNESJO", "B000035Z3C", "B000EDWKXI", "B0010X8NF0", "078322740X", "B000053VB5", "B00AEFY8MM", "B00007JXWX", "B00FZ4KR4U", "B000BBOUUE", "B001UV4XGU", "0786866586", "B000IU37SO", "0783229402", "B0071HPP3M", "B00IXD2LJY", "B000ADWDFC", "B000GFRI54", "B0000640VJ", "6305308802", "B000067J1O", "B004XVMCKS", "B002T51X4Q", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B0001Z4P2I", "B004XVMCK8", "B000B8QG22", "B003Z8ZC2A", "B001KP2J2G", "B004D45NYC", "B00005JMBQ", "B00AEBB8P6", "B00005JL7Q", "B00007AJE1", "B00BMKGZVA", "B00BEIYGK2", "B000CS45TW", "B00005JMJD", "B00005KHJJ", "B00319ECBK", "B0068MNO2U", "B004LWZWBU", "B0013D8LCC", "B004GJYRA0", "B000LXHK2C", "B002O3Z4ZW", "B001P3SA8K", "B003Y5H574", "B000T988I8", "B002ZFEQ76", "B001URA5Y8", "B002ZG99UE", "B00G3DA5XA", "0767815122", "B001UV4XUG", "B00AEBB9G4", "B00FWSWIUU", "B0001O3YV2", "B00AADAEBW", "B00008972P", "B001MM3AZM", "B00AEFXJ86", "B00A18CG76", "B004H83IG4", "B00803PFWM"], "bought_together": ["B000F6IODE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0786866586", "B00079HZUM", "B007HW18CS", "B002WY65VA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 30533}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.45, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B000EDWKX8", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51vVNaGhmPL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Shopgirl"}

{"description": "Deadwood: The Complete Second Seasoncontinues the Shakespearean brilliance of the landmarkfirst season, created byNYPD Bluehead writer David Milch. Milch either wrote or supervised the writing of each of the 12 episodes in this stunning follow-up, which contains more than a few surprises for anyone who thought they knew the myriad characters in the late 19th century town of Deadwood--a mucky, ungoverned, exceptionally violent development in South Dakota. As with the first season,Deadwoodcontinues to be about many things--survival, loyalty, alliances, duty--but all of them are happening against a titanic battle between several parties to consolidate power and real wealth in the territory. Despite his cutthroat ethics, astonishing profanity, and bursts of cruelty, it's hard not to side in this bid for a piece of America's future with saloon owner Al Swearengen (a magnificent performance by Ian McShane), a visionary monster who is nevertheless more recognizably human than his rivals.Entering an uneasy partnership with Al is Seth Bullock (Timothy Olyphant). Seth begins the second season by teaching Al a few lessons in chivalry, and their brief but bloody feud commences physical ailments for Al that become increasingly shocking to behold. Yet Al's difficulties have the practical effect of sidelining him for a couple of episodes while the story sets up more complex power struggles. Al takes on Deadwood's other saloon-brothel owner, the unstable Cy Tolliver (Powers Boothe), as well as an off-screen millionaire who is intent on owning all the gold-mining interests by buying out weary prospectors' claims. Meanwhile, Seth's wife and son (actually, his late brother's widow and child) arrive, an unsettling development for Seth's lover, the widow Alma Garret (Molly Parker), who soon reveals herself to be a more complicated person than in the first season. The prostitute Trixie (Paula Malcomson) begins thinking about her future and asserts independence from Al by having sex with Seth's friend, Sol Star (John Hawkes). Best of all, Calamity Jane (Robin Weigert) is back and more endearingly uncivilized than ever. Special features include actor commentaries on select episodes, the best of which finds Olyphant and McShane cracking each other up while watching the season premiere.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000NVI2GU", "B0006FO5LO", "B00B5J6A7W", "B007A2Z3Y4", "B0038M2APA", "B0075FF5QM", "B00A2JOQMW", "B004HW7JNS", "B00CG4XKNM", "B00EAPC860", "B00076YPUI", "B00HT850YW", "B00G4RCCUE", "B004BZ5AHI", "B000067S1G", "B008PJZDXW", "B00005NOHO", "B0028RXXE8", "B0090XO59U", "B0007YMVWO", "B00HUCF420", "B005LAJ1H2", "B00J5LXT44", "B009LDD54K", "B00316DDUO", "B0010XB1WM", "B00C8CQRQ4", "B00BC5I6Q2", "B00CDTSFF8", "B00EIXWW2O", "B002UJIY7A", "B0012RLX88", "B003Y5HWJU", "B000E3L7F0", "B0060MYKYY", "B00FEP9MYG", "B00EEDNR9A", "B000K2V7E6", "B00008PW1F", "B00BFAIH68", "B000BO7DWI", "B0058YPG1G", "B00IXWIFR2", "1596912391", "B000PGTPH8", "B00EUI4XHE", "B002N5N5QQ", "B0051GOB2G", "B003FSTN7U", "B00HW3EXCE", "B0032UYFA6", "B0007R4SWM", "B004QRUN96", "B00BQ42Q38", "B0032JTV6A", "B00GWJIDFW", "B001RTSPVY", "B001GCUER0", "B001TH8ZH8", "B00G0B7PTW", "B0006UEVUE", "6304711905", "B000NA1VI2", "B004CQZFH6", "B00280LZAE", "B000OIOOVE", "B00FRQ0HOQ", "B0015A5JVY", "B003PIUBZS", "B000FL7CB4", "B00BGI076M", "B009ERK2UI", "B001DJLCRC", "B00DJYJRHG", "B000YABIQ6", "B000EMGF3U", "B002ZCY8CC", "B002LITH76", "B001OQCVFG", "B001IBIHQ4", "B00KHA9BQ2", "B0009NZ2W4", "B00AATGDUC", "B0024FAR5M", "B003L77GS8", "B00CBJ53HS", "B00C7AO2J6", "B0038M2AOG", "B006CR2OOA", "B0012CJQYQ", "B008JFUS5A", "B00E1LSJIO", "B005FISBTO", "B000ENUYGI", "B000E6EK42", "B009LDD1H6", "B00HOGBXS6", "B00ECGHM5O", "B001EO748M", "B004WXBMT4"], "bought_together": ["B000NVI2GU", "B0006FO5LO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0006FO5LO", "B001FA1OTU", "B000NVI2GU", "B00B5J6A7W"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 5202}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 35.0, "brand": "Warner Brothers", "asin": "B000EULSR0", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51TO7W-wZzL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Deadwood: Season 2"}

Set in the New Burbage Theatre Festival, a fictional Canadian Provincial theatre, a jaded, burnt-out artistic director, Oliver Welles (Stephen Ouimette), dies suddenly, and is replaced by a potential genius, his visionary prot&#xE9;g&#xE9; Geoffrey Tennant (Due South's Paul Gross). Geoffrey is legendary at the New Burbage for his awe-inspiring performance ofHamletthere years before, and also because he went mad and now his sanity seems to be hanging by a thread. And oh, by the way, Oliver&#x92;s still hanging around as a ghost, but Geoffrey&#x92;s the only one who can see him (sound familiar?), and his impulsive reactions and out-loud arguments with Oliver--including one captured while being interviewed for a news program--besides being hilarious, convince the cast and crews he&#x92;s really lost it. The show details the daily activities at the festival as they attempt to mount a new production ofHamlet(starring a movie star who&#x92;s all face and no talent), and in doing so it employs a huge cast of peripheral characters, including the dysfunctional acting company (rising star Rachel McAdams has a key part), scheming board members, and a neurotic theatre staff, each with their own little subplots interweaving to make one big drama.This first-season set of the Sundance Channel program contains only six episodes, which is too bad because the series is so excellent it&#x92;ll leave you wanting more. The fact that shows of this caliber are rare makes it stand out all the more. The writing is topnotch, with memorable dialogue, biting dark humor, and clever situations that continually point out how absurd real life can get. This one is a real gem, a show that demonstrates &#x91;tis nobler in the mind to laugh at the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, rather than suffer them.--Daniel Vancini", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000H5U5M6", "B000P2A2X8", "B000XUF6BU", "B000AP31KQ", "B00515J6RW", "B0017KP8Y0", "B001O4C6MQ", "B000A59PWY", "B000A0GY0K", "B004AV5H3U", "B001V7YZES", "B00HHYF55C", "B00D49YFAA", "B005ELEN26", "B002TY78PU", "B000BR9S96", "B00FPPQYXM", "B00GWXI20E", "B00005A1SY", "B00GWXI2RM", "B009D4SFEC", "B00006FDCT", "B00005JLCI", "B000Z27HLS", "B00E3UN44W", "B00123BY6S"], "bought_together": ["B000H5U5M6", "B000P2A2X8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000XUF6BU", "B00ECR7KX2", "B000H5U5M6", "B00515J6RW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 115999}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 19.96, "brand": "", "asin": "B000FBFYKU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51H2SSJWEBL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Slings &amp; Arrows - Season 1"}
{"description": "Although wolves are supposed to have died out more than 200 years earlier, a quartet of lycanthropes prowl the ruined world of this post-apocalyptic fantasy. The shape-shifters include Tsume, a cynical criminal; eager, na&#xEF;ve Toboe; perpetually hungry Hige; and charismatic Kiba, who's seeking \"Rakuen,\" the prophesied wolf-paradise. Tied to his search are the Moon Flowers, and Cheza, a girl somehow created from those blossoms. But the wolf-boys aren't the only ones interested in the flower-girl. Scientist Cher Degr&#xE9; wants to continue studying Cheza in her laboratory, so she enlists the aid of detective Hubb. The fallen Noble Darcia and Lord Orkham and his minions are after Cheza, and she's somehow linked to Quent, a hunter bent on exterminating the wolf-humans.The world of high-tech machinery and the world of curses, prophecies, alchemy and shape-shifters would seem to be at odds, yet the filmmakers manage to integrate the two in this often intriguing fantasy-adventure.  The dark palate, angular designs, alienated characters, and dramatic camera angles will appeal to fans ofBlood: the Last Vampire, and \"Rakuen,\" the paradise Kiba seeks, remains a tantalizing promise.  But the plot ofWolf's Rainis complicated with secondary stories and minor characters the filmmakers fail to develop in the first half of the series. Episodes #15-18 consist almost entirely of flashbacks with only an occasional new scene or line of dialogue, which make the story feel both padded and underdeveloped.

{"description": "Surfacelasted one season on NBC before cancellation, butSurface: The Complete Serieson DVD will keep the show's exciting, Spielbergian suspense around for a long while. The primetime drama, involving several characters--in different parts of the world--all having similar brushes with fantastic creatures, instantly draws comparisons to Spielberg'sClose Encounters of the Third Kind. Add a government conspiracy (complete with a cover story to force one community's evacuation) to prevent the public from learning of the existence of a previously unknown life form, and the parallels withClose Encountersgrow thick. But it's not a problem: the many twists and turns inSurface's far-ranging storyline, and the nature of the species that slowly becomes a factor in the survival of the human race, are compelling on their own terms.Created by twin brothers and television writers-producers-directors Josh and Jonas Pate (L.A. Dragnet),Surfacestars rangy beauty Lake Bell as oceanographer and single mom Dr. Laura \"Dee\" Daughtery. While doing some research in a submersible at the bottom of the sea, Dee discovers a seemingly bottomless pit leading to astonishing depths in the Earth. But she also bumps into a sea monster that emanates electrical charges strong enough to wreak havoc with her vessel. Meanwhile, a Louisiana-based insurance salesman, Rich (Jay R. Ferguson), is traumatized when he sees his brother dragged away by a similar creature, and a 14-year-old boy, Miles (Carter Jenkins), raises one of the beasts after it hatches from an egg. Throughout all this, a scientist (Rade Sherbedgia) and a heavy-handed national security agent (Ian Anthony Dale) are trying to unlock the mystery of the species, which appears to be growing in number at the same time strange forces are affecting the oceans. Naturally, there's a story behind the story--government and corporate shenanigans and all that. That stuff gets a little tedious and, truth be told, a couple of the show's protagonists are among the most unlikable people seen in series television in a long while. But despite its premature end after a mere 15 episodes,Surfacefinally offers an original, unsettling, and even surreal vision of the world going through apocalyptic transformations. The final image of the final show lingers in the imagination a long time.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000FOPPBA", "B0051GOB2G", "B000E5N6B6", "B000FIHN8O", "B003PGNBO8", "B000N3T0EG", "B0037AGB9O", "B001QE99BA", "B000EOTV98", "B0002S94BQ", "B001CQONMC", "B000FS9MY2", "B000ELL1QC", "B002DQSKME", "B001RXDM2M", "B000JLTRHW", "B004XM38CS", "B002TQKL7A", "B003LXM1PK", "B0009JE6G6", "B000MMMTD2", "B00465I156", "B001715A92", "B00BHLTIXQ", "B002U0KHME", "B001RHGRTS", "B001A7GOCA", "B00005JM39", "B003R0MEYA", "B0081QF6Q8", "B00061QJSK", "B00B04NIZO", "B0012IX35S", "B00404ME2E", "B000BCCAEQ", "B00F3L8P26", "B007G4X7VC", "B002QU1Z1K", "B00170LCWC", "B003LXM1B4", "B008B4KVRE", "B004LROMS4", "B0011FLH00", "B00IWTVDUW", "B00062IDEW", "B002USF1UO", "B0055SNHQG", "B000ERVJLS", "B00023BKMC", "B000MX7V66", "B0009JE6FM", "B000QUEQ4U", "B000FUTVPA", "B0056GLNQI", "B008I34YOO", "B000SMNL92", "B00HUPC5X8", "B00BN0WQ5I", "B00JF5GAZA", "B00CRX82LM", "B00KHA9BQ2", "B004YPED14", "B0012Z36F8", "B002BWP2IK", "B000067FP2", "B000WTZ6SK", "B003H9LIU2", "B004LROMWU", "B0000V4910", "B00ECXJC28", "B0006UEVUE", "B00B4804LM", "B001C4CI8U", "B00005B8UD", "B0007CEXUY", "B0038MUZ3E", "B003L77GWE", "B009AMAJBO", "B0007OCG5Q", "B00133QNSG", "B001CY5N00", "B000E8JO2S", "B005PPMHO2", "B002JVWRD6", "B002QZDSW4", "B00KTZALDC", "B004X60QE2", "B000ATQYXI", "B0009A407A", "B0017IVHHO", "B000SQFC2C", "B002C3GTLC", "B000BR9SA0", "B0012IXBNC", "B000A9QKT6", "B0032JTUX4", "B000BOH8Y6", "B00H57HOSC", "B0030VANIU", "B00B5ARKC0"], "bought_together": ["B000FOPPBA", "B0051GOB2G"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000N3T0EG", "B000FOPPBA", "B000E5N6B6", "B0051GOB2G"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 25662}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 12.39, "brand": "Universal Studios", "asin": "B000FJH5M2", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51D2Q9RFRVL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Surface: The Complete Series"}

{"description": "Based on Eric Ormer's comic strip,The Mostly Unfabulous Social Life of Ethan Greenis an almost fluffy romantic comedy starring Ethan (Daniel Letterle), a gay man whose trials and tribulations amount to not much more than difficulties in dating and finding a rented apartment. Leo (David Monahan), Ethan's ex-boyfriend, is selling the house Ethan currently resides in, while Ethan enters a whirlwind romance with baseball fetishist, Kyle (Diego Serrano). While Ethan debates where to live, he dumps Kyle and starts dating Punch (Dean Shelton), a cute, young real estate agent who hatches a plan to sabotage Leo's intentions to sell the property. The finest moments of this situational comedy occur when the Hat Sisters (Joel Brooks and Richard Riehle), a pair of cross-dressing, older lovers, are on screen cracking jokes and looking like Erma Bombeck. Meanwhile, Ethan's mom (Meredith Baxter) advises him to seek courage in order to find the right man, as Ethan tires of the dating game. Director George Bamber's adaptation is entertaining, though the entertainment feels as if its at the expense of some characters who are the most stereotypically gay. Because of the film's employment of stereotypes, it's difficult to sympathize with Ethan's plight. Clearly not meant to challenge intellectually,Ethan Greendoes contain some endearing scenes that make it mostly fun to watch.--Trinie Dalton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000560PU", "B00008UALE", "B00FGG60XY", "B0013D8LCW", "B00HUQCA28", "B0000VV4MW", "B00996RSYM", "B000WDVNMO", "B0042KZJFA", "B00GHP8SH4", "B0080JX4Y2", "B0062QHZJU", "B0096UG7XY", "B0042L0OFE", "B00GSA3K6C", "B00F98FOPE", "B006FYYWQS", "B00099415C", "B00IA7MFEO", "B001AOC9K4", "B0084BM7NK", "B00GB0ORJ8", "B000NVT0UM", "B004L03B3S", "B006GGREO2", "B0006GVJEY", "B001FBSLPE", "B0002I84JO", "B009J212G6", "B00564HZYY", "B000HWXPXK", "B0083V2VYG", "B00E44FEAE", "B00IEA3LKE", "B00EU8RB14", "B00HW3F1IO", "B001Y7CVXC", "B005C6BGVY", "B0057SJUKQ", "B000SQJ28C", "B005GM38MO", "B005TIK4SQ", "B002SSNFUO", "B00DUJH94S", "B00CKZE7FC", "B000GBEWIO", "B00005QAQD", "B007L6JQ3S", "B007OXB1GI", "B00E849QSG", "B001UDPAAG", "B000R7G9JW", "B00000F5B5", "B0042L0OG8", "B00BJRYJ1O", "B000HLDFMM", "B004XKUFY4", "B00118S6CY", "B002Y3GZD2", "B001ATWK2Q", "B000GBEWI4", "B004PQBYVE", "B003Z8ZC0W", "B00HHYF5EI", "B00G3MXSW6", "B000UNYJOK", "B00DUJH8V2", "B000056BPH", "B005JZBPFU", "1884190618", "B000ARXG7W", "B000CR7R7K", "B004FSXRMQ", "B002L1YGRY", "B008JFX04G", "B001OSC4BA", "B002PCVLWW", "6305744777", "B000VKJ6UE", "B0099PW0D2", "0780629167", "B005GM38NI", "B008YUHQEG", "B00008AOTW", "B00FPVGWY2", "B001ATWK4E", "B00B4MMQJ6", "B001CT05N0", "B008N25X7M", "B000FTJ74Q", "B000BZISX0", "B000WMFZM4", "B00JVX8194", "B003VE9WPG", "B008MB1FQ2", "B00IJZMZW4", "B005KBP07W", "B0000B1A36"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0000VV4MW", "B000UX6TK2", "B0002I84JO", "B002PCVLWW"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 137419}, "asin": "B000HC2M16", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5100M5V9T8L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Mostly Unfabulous Social Life of Ethan Green"}
{"description": "All good things must come to an end--even a classic TV series likeThe Andy Griffith Show--but most would hope to close out their network run like the venerable rural comedy series did, with its popularity intact (Griffith brought the show to a close with its ratings at #1) and its episodes still featuring the gentle, observant humor that marked every visit to Mayberry since its debut in 1960. Few changes can be seen in the 30 episodes compiled here, save for the color broadcast (which came to pass during the '65-'66 season) and the arrival of Sam Jones (the likable Ken Berry), another amiable widower who became the focus of the spin-off series,Mayberry R.F.D.Otherwise, it's business as usual in Mayberry, which includes a welcome return visit from Don Knotts' Barney Fife (in \"Barney Hosts a Summit Meeting,\" where he convinces Andy to let the U.S. and Soviet governments host a summit in his home), a turn in the role of deputy for Goober (George Lindsay) in \"Suppose Andy Gets Sick,\" a great deal of tomfoolery by newer characters Howard Sprague (Jack Dodson) and Emmett Clark (Paul Hartman), and guest appearances by Jack Nicholson (\"Aunt Bee the Juror\"), Allan (The Brady Bunch) Melvin (\"Howard's Main Event\") and Morgan Brittany as \"Opie's First Love.\" Fans may debate on the quality of the final season in comparison to those that preceded it (and to be fair, there are a handful of less-than-stellar episodes, most notably \"Opie's Group,\" which finds Andy's son joining a rock band), but the comfortable performances by the cast help to smooth over any rough patches.

{"description": "Cars swerve to avoid an agitated man wandering on a freeway until the man is hit by a truck and killed. Eyewitnesses said the man, Pat Fisher, was clearly disturbed, and some on the police force think that no other explanation or investigation is necessary-- except for Detective Tom Monroe (Robert Carlyle, The Full Monty). Finding newspaper clippings, class photos and tape recordings about Fisher's classmates dating back to 1976 in the dead man's apartment, Monroe discovers three other mysterious deaths among the class. Soon the deaths and their strange circumstances, which date back to the kidnapping and murder of 10-year-old Amy Irvine, begin to haunt the detective as much as they did Fisher. In this tense, gripping psychological thriller, Monroe must unravel the mystery of the Class of '76 before, as Fisher warns from beyond the grave, \"It won't be suicide, won't be an accident.

{"description": "Dallas: The Complete Sixth Seasonbegins with a bang: Miss Ellie (Barbara Bel Geddes), Bobby (Patrick Ewing) and Lucy (Charlene Tilton) vote to remove J.R. Ewing (Larry Hagman) as president of Ewing oil. Big stuff, but J.R. soon lands a job running competitor Harwood Oil. Meanwhile, in this classic primetime soap, J.R. and brother Bobby find themselves on opposite ends of a titanic clash set in motion by patriarch Jock Ewing&#x92;s will once the latter is declared legally dead. And now that he is officially deceased, Jock's widow, Miss Ellie, becomes interested in a social life again. This results in some discomfort for J.R., who wants his mom to be mom, despite having almost blackmailed her in the first place to release the will. Ludicrous as it all might sound,Dallasis always nothing less than absorbing, and the changes and surprises that come with the territory--the ever-shifting alliances, the come-from-behind victories, the constant scheming to tear down family and friends--are fascinating.InDallas: The Compete Fifth Season, J.R. won back his estranged wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray). Yet she seems to be having second thoughts about life as a Ewing, prompting J.R. to take another crack at convincing her to stay with him--while doing his bidding in unscrupulous business maneuvers, of course. Sue Ellen and sister-in-law Pamela (Victoria Principal) become unexpectedly close, and even more unexpected is Pamela's request to husband Bobby that he drop the fraternal competition with J.R. to run Ewing Oil for good. Abortions, tensions, and a chance for longtime, obsessive enemy of the Ewings Cliff Barnes (Ken Kercheval), so recently comatose, to get even with his nemesis are all on the menu. As usual, watchingDallasis like witnessing a car crash and being too mesmerized to leave.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000PAAK0A", "B000FI9OD6", "B000YGGNIS", "B0016I0AGY", "B000BVM1TG", "B001C9S0F0", "B0009IW894", "B001JAHPWQ", "B001JAHPX0", "B001JAHPXA", "B001JAHPXK", "B00028G7LG", "B004H83IHI", "B00E7XS4EA", "B009GYS70Q", "B0015I2S7E", "B000CS45AG", "B00CD45J5W", "B001BN4WLS", "B000PGUT8C", "B004X1M47O", "B004X1M3DE", "B002VJ05EE", "B001QU9RRK", "B007R915RE", "B00005JOA4", "B00450S800", "B00H5NY6F0", "B002VJ05EO", "1581824726", "B0007IO6V4", "B000QUEQ68", "B00274SIVA", "B003BGZ61S", "B00D4ABT8K", "B0062VL4YW", "B00K8HALVI", "B002ACKBU0", "B000O77SNG", "B00AQ6ROHK", "B00J9BZ4KC", "B005DEUEV8", "B002XKKX8E", "B007ZR9HP0", "B001VB8UCW", "B0007WFY4S", "B007ZR9HPA", "B000FA57U8", "B0002Y4T7O", "B00HQLZCIQ", "B0077PTWX2", "B00HRUQA6O", "B0007WQHFS", "B00308B170", "B00EFYAZAM", "B00JEZWRE4", "B00GT7GYVW", "B00AQ6KAQ2", "B001GLFPWK", "B00005JO3P", "B004WO9OMA", "B004MWLXTY", "B000ASDFIG", "B005DCJ0Q0", "B00GLT2TR6", "B000C6NPHC", "B002AMVED8", "B000DZ95IU", "B004YM6JVO", "B00EAPC860", "B00005JNIS", "B000PFUAN2", "B001AQBGM4", "B00166UFSY", "B00EIXWW2O", "B000FUH38C", "B000FOPPBA", "B00IN69P0E", "B000XJD3JS", "B000EXDS3Y", "B00005JOJR", "B001VPJYZK", "B00AEBB9LY", "B001G0MFKQ", "B00DXLO0D6", "B0050MB5AC", "B00CYQXATG", "B00BUWD7E8", "B0007WFXIK", "B00CWIMVDW", "B008H6GHII", "B001AI776G", "B002JVWRBS", "B000Q6GUKW"], "bought_together": ["B000FI9OD6", "B000PAAK0A"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000PAAK0A", "B000FI9OD6", "B000BVM1TG", "B0009IW894"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 13909}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 16.29, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B000JLTRFE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RM4vSr-jL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Dallas: Season 6"}

{"description": "It takes a certain kind of comic genius to create a character who is, to quote the classic Sondheim lyric, appealing and appalling. But be forewarned:Boratis not \"something for everyone.\" It arrives as advertised as one of the most outrageous, most offensive, and funniest films in years. Kazakhstan journalist Borat Sagdiyev (Sacha Baron Cohen reprising the popular character from hisDa Ali G Show), leaves his humble village to come to \"U.S. and A\" to film a documentary. After catching an episode ofBaywatchin his New York hotel room, he impulsively scuttles his plans and, accompanied by his fat,hirsute producer (Hardy to his Laurel), proceeds to California to pursue the object of his obsession, Pamela Anderson.Boratis not about how he finds America; it's about how America finds him in a series of increasingly cringe-worthy scenes. Borat, with his '70s mustache, well-worn grey suit, and outrageously backwards attitudes (especially where Jews are concerned) interacts with a cross-section of the populace, catching them, a la Alan Funt onCandid Camera, in the act of being themselves. Early on, an unwitting humor coach advises Borat about various types of jokes. Borat asks if his brother's retardation is a ripe subject for comedy. The coach patiently replies, \"That would not be funny in America.\" NOT! Borat is subversively, bracingly funny. When it comes to exploring uncharted territory of what is and is not appropriate or politically correct, Borat knows no boundaries, as when he brings a fancy dinner with the southern gentry to a halt after returning from the bathroom with a bag of his feces (\"The cultural differences are vast,\" his hostess graciously/patronizingly offers), or turns cheers to boos at a rodeo when he calls for bloodlust against the Iraqis and mangles \"The Star Spangled Banner.\"Success, John F. Kennedy once said, has a thousand fathers. A paternity test onBoratmight reveal traces of Bill Dana's Jose Jimenez, Andy Kaufman, Michael Moore,The Jamie Kennedy Xperiment, andJackass. Some scenes seem to have been staged (a game Anderson, whom Borat confronts at a book signing, was reportedly in on the setup), but others, as the growing litany of lawsuits attests, were not. All too real is Borat's encounter with loutish Southern frat boys who reveal their sexism and racism, and the disturbing moment when he asks a gun store owner what gun he would recommend to \"kill a Jew\" (a Glock automatic is the matter-of-fact reply). Comedy is not pretty, and inBoratit can get downright ugly, as when Borat and his producer get jiggly with it during a nude fight that spills out from their hotel room into the hallway, elevator, lobby and finally, a mortgage brokers association banquet. High-five! --Donald LiebensonOn the DVD\"Global Visitings\" capturesBorat-mania in all its hype and glory, as Sacha Baron Cohen, never breaking character, promotes his film around the world. On the itinerary isLate Night with Conan O'Brienand the Toronto Film Festival, a now-legendary screening aborted after a projector malfunction. A mixed bag of deleted scenes finds Borat trying to bait more unsuspecting citizens, including an animal-control worker who refuses Borat a dog after he asks, \"How do you recommend I cook this?\" and a doctor who is nonplussed by Borat's obscene medical history. A supermarket visit offers the most maddening fromage-inspired looniness since Monty Python's \"Cheese Shop\" sketch. Also good for a few chuckles are a faux soundtrack commercial and aBaywatchparody (\"Sexydangerwatch\").--Donald LiebensonBeyondBoratAll things Sacha Baron CohenBoratApparelBoratSoundtrackStills fromBorat(click for larger image)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002P7UCJ0", "B005LAIHGI", "B0002ZMITY", "B002OID4WM", "B00020X852", "B000A88ESW", "B000WZEZGI", "B001G5T6GW", "B005LAIHHC", "B00AEFZ8OY", "B002P7UCJA", "B00005JNZU", "B001DPHDB0", "B001J9KJ4I", "B00G2P79BU", "B000J4QW8Q", "B00AEFYS2M", "B00005JMYI", "B002Q4VBPQ", "B0006GANPA", "B001OD4S50", "6305922756", "B003XJABTK", "B00AEBBA2C", "B008R65XNS", "B000BKVQS4", "B00AEBB9K0", "B003CRM6PA", "B000A7DVR2", "B00AEBB8FQ", "B0016MOV92", "B000BKJ762", "B00009W5CA", "B000AP04L0", "B008220BGQ", "B002T9H2LA", "B00068WOH8", "0385523467", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00008975Z", "B004SIP95G", "B00003CXZ1", "0783229526", "B002ZG99N6", "B003VPX5Y4", "B002SJIO4A", "B00005JLQN", "B00AEFY854", "B00005O3VC", "B004XVMCH6", "B000K7VHQE", "B0006HBZEW", "B00005JMUA", "B000VE439Y", "B00AEFXDO6", "B000EMGJAO", "B0000A02TZ", "B00005JNBQ", "B003Y5H5B0", "B00BEIYMZ6", "B004SIP8ZM", "B000MCH5RM", "B000K7VHOG", "B00005ALS0", "B001UV4X8S", "B00009MGEM", "B0001Z4OXS", "B000C20VPA", "B0012IWNZY", "B00CE00ZV8", "B00005QCVX", "B000I0RNVQ", "B000022TSW", "B001TOD92C", "B000P0J09M", "B00005JL78", "B00AEFYAMA", "B00AEFXGIY", "B000J4P9P8", "B000055Y0X", "B004EPZ084", "B001VLBDD0", "B00AEFY5B6", "B006XZWAWM", "B00005JKMN", "B00AEFY0F2", "B000XFVIOO", "B002GSXKOW", "B00006G8HR", "B000HT386M", "B000MQCUJG", "B00007AJF7", "B00005KA6V", "B004SIP9MY", "B00AEBBA72", "B00018D42W", "B000TZJBPQ", "B0009HBPN0", "B004P9UWM8"], "bought_together": ["B005LAIHGI", "B002P7UCJ0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005LAIHGI", "B000WZEZGI", "B002OID4WM", "B000TZJBPQ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 15271}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.29, "brand": "COHEN,SACHA BARON", "asin": "B000MMMT9G", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51uGbGa68JL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan"}
