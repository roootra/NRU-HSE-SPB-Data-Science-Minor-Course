{"description": "This is the restored, 209-minute director's cut of Wolfgang Petersen's harrowing and claustrophobic U-boat thriller, which was theatrically rereleased in 1997. Originally made as a five-hour miniseries, this version devotes more time to getting to know the crew before they and their stoic captain (J&uuml;rgen Prochnow) get aboard their U-boat and find themselves stranded at the bottom of the sea.Das Bootputs you inside that submerged vessel and explores the physical and emotional tensions of the situation with a vivid, terrifying realism that few movies can match. As Petersen tightens the screws and the submerged ship blows bolts, the pressure builds to such unbearable levels that you may be tempted to escape for a nice walk on solid land in the great outdoors--only you wouldn't dream of looking away from the screen.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00003CXHJ", "B0009RCPUC", "B009XTF8NI", "B0001NBMH6", "B00008K76U", "B00AEFYENK", "0304352314", "B00IJZW3QW", "B0001FGC1U", "B000021Y77", "0792841670", "6304765258", "B00005YUO1", "B00004XPPC", "B000274THQ", "B000EHSVS2", "B000EHSVSC", "B00005N5S3", "B00005JPKE", "B000E5N6KW", "B000NO1XJA", "B000OVLBGC", "0792839730", "B004VGHF7K", "B0007TKNGA", "B0000AMRUP", "B000O78L0U", "B0001NBMGC", "B00096S4B2", "B000H1RFQ4", "B00ID8H8EW", "B0001HLVS2", "B00005PJ8T", "B005HP2IYE", "B000MGTQ7K", "B00001ZWUS", "B00008AOTR", "B0009XRZI8", "B00079ZACC", "B000KGGJ0Y", "B00005AVZU", "B003ELKNH2", "B005HQBO9I", "B00005PJ8S", "B00005QCVP", "B005DTZXL4", "B00005JN9P", "B00AEFXVCU", "B0001WTWWE", "0790742047", "B00008PC0Y", "B00KHWSB5M", "B004ZJZQFG", "B0015D20FE", "B001TUZG4K", "B002KECJZ8", "079284646X", "B000MGTQ7U", "B00006ADD5", "B0000A02TY", "B0009A40EI", "B004R6EF9U", "B00008AOTO", "B000E5N63Y", "B00AEFYBA6", "B000M4RG42", "B000H5V8H2", "B00AEBBA36", "B00IVLR9JA", "B00009MEC4", "B00BTYNXL4", "B002QP145C", "B00BTYJYR6", "0792841409", "B004GJYRI2", "0792838408", "B000YKT4BW", "B002ID09BM", "B0051HCVEU", "B0037A4ILC", "B000TGCR38", "B00008AOTN", "B00005JKF6", "B000O599Z8", "B00008PC13", "B00B0U2SFE", "B003AWRMCO", "B000H1RFSM", "B0006B2A42", "B0012QE4PI", "B0006GANN2", "B006TTC5HC", "B0002XVS7Y", "B000I6BJ56", "B004QSQMPE", "B00005U8EN", "B008XJM7T2", "B000FZETR0"], "bought_together": ["B0001NBMH6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00IJZW3QW", "B00003CXHJ", "B009XTF8NI", "B0009RCPUC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 11970}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 16.47, "brand": "Columbia/Tristar Studios", "asin": "0767802470", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51PPEJHCV3L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Das Boot - The Director's Cut"}

{"description": "This thoroughly unpleasant thriller from the hands of Joel Schumacher (Batman and Robin) offers very little in its lurid tour of snuff films and the seedy pornographic underworld. A wooden Nicolas Cage stars as a private detective hired by a tycoon's widow, who discovers in her dead husband's safe some 8mm footage of a young girl being sexually abused and slaughtered. Cage's job is to determine the veracity of the film and to find out the girl's identity, whether she be alive or dead. What could have been a taut, nerve-jangling thriller is instead a lumbering, overwrought but underwritten tale of vigilante justice. Screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker also penned the imaginative and compellingSeven, but you wouldn't know it from this tired and monotonous script. Schumacher tries for echoes of bothThe Silence of the Lambsand Paul Schrader'sHardcore(which stars George C. Scott as a father trying to find his daughter in the seedy porn industry), but despite some slick camerawork, the film fails to draw the audience into either the mystery of the missing girl or Cage's supposed internal conflicts. It's not so much the unsavory subject matter as it is the sloppy and unimaginative filmmaking that makes the movie unbearable. Of the entire cast only Joaquin Phoenix, as a charismatic goth boy who works at an adult book store, comes away with a memorable performance.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00003JRAB", "0783223218", "6303486746", "630470786X", "6302479487", "6304826133", "6301966899"], "also_viewed": ["B00012F6A6"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 474128}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.95, "brand": "", "asin": "076781956X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5136N2XDYBL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "8mm [VHS]"}

Featuring the brief screen debut of Tony Curtis,Criss  Crossis a stylish masterpiece of clashing fates and fatal attractions;  Franz Planer's cinematography creates a shadow world in which every desire is  tainted by the threat of violence, and Miklos Rozsa's score underlines a love  story that could never end happily. Film noir doesn't get any bleaker--or  better--than this.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000006561", "6301979680", "6302413400"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 433990}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.99, "brand": "", "asin": "0783213115", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZBZSYSFCL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Criss Cross [VHS]"}
{"description": "A mixed bag that received mixed reviews when released in 1994, this lavish film works overtime to honor the spirit and style of the vintage pulp novels and radio shows that madeThe Shadowa household name in the 1930s and '40s. Alec Baldwin plays the Shadow, a.k.a. Lamont Cranston, who arrives in New York from his decadent life in Tibet, fully reformed and disciplined in his ability \"to cloud men's minds.\" A crime fighter who lurks in the dark recesses of the city, the Shadow faces his most deadly challenge when Shiwan Khan (John Lone), the last surviving descendant of Genghis Khan, hatches a plot to conquer the world. The scheme involves a madman (Tim Curry), a hapless scientist (Ian McKellen), and various traps designed to catch and kill the Shadow, who must also contend with his blossoming romance with Margo Lane (Penelope Ann Miller), a slender beauty capable of a little mind play of her own. The movie's art deco production design turns out to be a scene-stealer when the plot drags, and in the title role Baldwin is never given enough good material to create a compelling character. Still,The Shadowis true to the legacy that inspired it, admirably avoiding any conspicuous compromise of its 1930s style and setting. If you can't get into the story, you're sure to be hooked by the look of the production, which is never less than dazzling.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00BTYMPUY", "6305428514", "B003Q7B7BU", "B00005T7I1", "B000PFUAP0", "B00801OMDM", "B00264QI68", "B000051SH3", "0783226012", "B0002J58J2", "B0080JTIX8", "B004BBHVIS", "B005E7SF7E", "B0038ZITIE", "B0006IIPIK", "1558908846", "B000FVQLKM", "1606903616", "B000ION23U", "B004EPZ07K", "B003G5K7RW", "B005G5NPD8", "B00007AJF5", "B00003CWU3", "B0011367SY", "B00JL6L4UY", "B0045HCJKS", "B001RHGRT8", "0800195175", "B0009ZBVBI", "B004EXWGJW", "0780622650", "B0006L0LOS", "6304712499", "B00005JKU0", "B000056WR3", "B0000YEEPS", "B0002A2VLY", "B0002J58HO", "B00AKGG828", "0790738511", "B0045HCJT4", "B00D3LA7G0", "B000056PMU", "B000055Y0Y", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B002GHHHNI", "B000AQOHNA", "B0019BI1DM", "078401132X", "B002GHHHOM", "B00004Y87O", "6305127646", "B0085A9HU6", "B002NZK5Q4", "B002GHHHME", "B0024FADAQ", "0767818105", "B000CNE09M", "B00006IUJO", "B004VT9JLC", "B00026ZG10", "B0000844I8", "B0045HCJGC", "B00003CXKA", "0767802454", "B002GHHHP6", "B000QUCQX8", "B001ARDC16", "0783225547", "B003Q7B71K", "B001MVYUQG", "B00070FX5U", "B004EPYZPS", "B00HFWETQW", "0783225946", "B0006HBZXS", "B0002V7OI8", "B002VWNID6", "B00GOYC3P6", "6305761078", "B00BTYOYG2", "B000BR9SA0", "0790731932", "1570199450", "B0001I55SS", "B0000959N0", "B0009MDPYM", "B00007AJGH", "B00HZMZ2FE", "B0002TSZHY", "B00009NHC0", "B0051PLQR0", "B001FB55HQ", "B00AEFXPG2", "B009L4DSV4", "B0001US8F8", "B0002J58GU", "B000WC39P4", "B000063UR0"], "bought_together": ["B00BTYMPUY", "6305428514"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00BTYMPUY", "6305428514", "B003Q7B7BU", "0783226012"]}, "price": 7.86, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 17047}, "asin": "078321958X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51QWAVSWAQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Shadow"}
{"description": "Steven Spielberg's first feature film, 1971'sDuel, is set on a desert highway. It stars Dennis Weaver as a driver being pursued by a menacing truck, which is following him with all the vengeance of the ancient furies. In this spiritual update from 1984, C.&nbsp;Thomas Howell plays a guy taking a drive-away car from Chicago to San Diego. On a whim, in the rain, and against his better judgment, he picks up a hitchhiker (Rutger Hauer). The hitcher quickly admits to being a murdering psychopath, and once Howell finally gets him out of his car, he is pursued with all the vengeance of the ancient furies. We're never sure if the hitcher is a figment of his imagination, making Howell a schizophrenic killer, or if he's real and Howell is the random victim of a wandering madman, which is how his potential new girlfriend (Jennifer Jason Leigh) thinks of him. Either way,The Hitcheris great fun, kinda scary, and teetering on the brink of \"must see.\"--Andy Spletzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00009LIA5", "B000NO3DLG", "B00595W3QK", "B00LLAV26O", "B000063UR5", "B00AEFXKZ8", "B00004RERE", "B00LBFFR2Y", "B00IYJRIKO", "B0001FGBWK", "B002AMVEII", "B0002YLEBI", "B006ZGROB6", "B0000589K4", "B000PMFRYC", "B000E1ZBIG", "0767817664", "B002JT69OG", "B0013527K2", "B00AEBB91E", "B0002WT4OE", "B000069I05", "B0024FADD8", "B00005N5RM", "B000RGN2JI", "B000TSIJWY", "B000MX7V3O", "B000IMUYJM", "B0009X768W", "B00006L92P", "B00JJOY45U", "B008CYDD7I", "B0000VV55I", "B00009OWI1", "B000E8M0P6", "6305137382", "B001DZOC64", "B002GHHHG0", "B00AEFY37C", "B00004TS0G", "B0002VYOVS", "B004QF71ZM", "B00KDU8HQQ", "B0002IQLH6", "B000MV8ABS", "B00JJOY47I", "B0002DB5PO", "B0024FAG44", "B0002O7XW2", "B000FS9FE4", "6304936532", "B000AM6OQ2", "B00005KH30", "B00006FDCU", "B000Q66Q8I", "B0053TWW36", "B0002C4JIU", "B00012FX4K", "B00HRUQ8X4", "B00009PY4C", "B0007WQHI0", "B00JJOY496", "B000H5TH1Q", "B0001611DI", "B001KEHAEO", "B000099T3M", "B0001Y4M22", "B000031EG1", "B00JQYV0B4", "B00AEFXR8I", "B0002C4JJ4", "B000EOTVU2", "0783229399", "B00005AQMK", "B005GT3X68", "B000N4RAQU", "B00JF5GAY6", "B000MV8AC2", "B00AEFY31S", "B005ZHBEPI", "B00E0FW07W", "B00KCTG4PO", "B0053TWV46", "B00ARWX9NG", "B0000694WL", "B000068IEV", "B000RPCJA2", "0792846435", "B00008L3UQ", "B002VWNIDG", "B004QXJZY4", "B002HWUU9U", "B001B8XRT6", "B007XF0W3K", "B002HML6YI", "6305869103", "1573623865", "0792846443", "B000GBEWRU"], "bought_together": ["B00009LIA5", "B000NO3DLG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000NO3DLG", "6305161860", "B0000589K4", "B001BGS16W"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 70249}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 17.09, "brand": "HAUER,RUTGER", "asin": "0783114893", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51fbu7rU1ZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Hitcher"}

{"description": "After a career slump that plagued him through most of the 1980s, Al Pacino made a stellar comeback in this taut 1989 thriller, playing a weary New York police detective who falls in love with the woman (Ellen Barkin) who is the prime suspect in the murder case he's investigating. Expertly written by Richard Price and directed by Harold Becker, the story is designed to keep its central characters (and the viewer) in a state of constant suspicion and arousal--an emotional combination that sends dangerous sparks flying between Pacino and Barkin. Their chemistry is intense, and their love scenes are some of the hottest of any movie of its decade. ButSea of Loveis not merely concerned with cheap titillation. It's a riveting whodunit with scenes of nail-biting suspense and memorable dialogue that make it as interesting to listen to as it is to watch. Barkin had made a similarly sexy impression inThe Big Easy, and here she gives one of the best performances of her underrated career, matching Pacino's excellence scene for scene. The ending's a bit of a letdown because the murder solution comes somewhat out of the blue, but it's the acting and suspense that you'll remember most--qualities that makeSea of Loveone of the best films of its kind.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305262268", "B0043X1FNQ", "B00BTYRB3U", "B000HC2LHG", "B00008L3S6", "B00441GYPG", "0783226845", "B00AEBB95K", "B00000K3TU", "B00013RC66", "6305308837", "6305310335", "B0000AM6JI", "B00AEFXX9Q", "B0045HCJIK", "B0043X1FKY", "B003LR5BD0", "B004SUDQ1S", "6305065551", "B000E5N684", "B00000JGHL", "B000A9QK6E", "B000CNESTE", "B00004XPPB", "0790730979", "B000CBCWRG", "B000P0J0AG", "B00005K3NU", "B00AEFYD9K", "B00005JLX2", "0792844874", "B00127RAGC", "B002AS463W", "B0015OKWL2", "B002AT8KAG", "B0002T7YQW", "B000C20VRS", "6305213305", "079073219X", "B0009GX1CO", "B00AEFYC96", "B000H5TH1Q", "B0045HCJ8K", "B00009Y3PV", "B00441GYOM", "B00000J11D", "B000LP6KMQ", "0767810872", "B00005U2KC", "B00009WVSL", "B000EQ5SRK", "B00AEFYD2M", "B004YCKKFK", "B00015YVDG", "B00AEFXN9G", "B00003CWRX", "B00BLF9FYA", "B00AEBB9N2", "B00005JO5L", "B00005K3NV", "B000069HZP", "B00AEFXT1S", "B00AEFXIIW", "B00AEBB9EG", "6305428484", "B001NY4WYC", "B000059TGB", "B00006RCNY", "B002VWNICC", "B00AEFXG2U", "B00006L91I", "B006GVN05O", "B000087F6M", "B000UGBOT0", "B00AEFXKZ8", "B003AWRMA6", "B001TK80D4", "B002NZK5RI", "076782170X", "B000A9QK5K", "B00005OLYF", "0767817729", "B004499LX0", "B0001US62I", "B000GNOSDG", "B0006GANN2", "B00005JLJW", "B00005JMIJ", "B00AEFXBPM", "B0006HBZBK", "B00AEFYW64", "B00007G1YQ", "B0001FGBW0", "B000FO0AA6", "B003INBNOS", "0767802616", "B000A2UBN4"], "bought_together": ["6305262268", "B000HC2LHG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00C7MW53E", "6305262268", "B000HC2LHG", "0783226845"]}, "price": 33.0, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 231594}, "asin": "0783226918", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51G3SG0CZAL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Sea of Love"}

{"description": "Unfairly dismissed by a number of critics,Two Minute Warningis  an absorbing contemplation of the phenomenon of violence. Based on a novel by George LaFountaine, the story concerns an anonymous (and, until the very end, faceless) sniper perched above the scoreboard at a championship football game in Los Angeles. His lack of identity and unstated motivation is key to the film's air of cautionary fable, in which the killer's rage is one end of a continuum that includes many different kinds of violence among numerous characters: emotional withdrawal, police brutality, subtle racism, chips on various shoulders. Produced in 1976, the movie has all the hallmarks of the decade's vogue for disaster flicks: an ensemble cast, a web of story lines, and a lot of people contained in one place where something awful happens. But it is also something more: a successful exercise in plastic storytelling, a clever interweaving of a dozen discrete subplots with a mix of documentary and original action footage. The explosiveness of the football game itself becomes a refrain of ritualized mayhem in director Larry Peerce's patchwork film, but without beating us over the head with its metaphorical obviousness.Two Minute Warningmay not be a great or classic work, but it is far more than the sum of its many parts and does leave a lasting impression.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEFXJF4", "0783229399", "B0033YFI6Q", "B000OHZJO6", "B000ETRA5U", "B0050MB5N4", "B00AFEYS9A", "0792843649", "B001KO1BCG", "B0006HBZBK", "B001PYD0PC", "B004OB2EYQ", "0783229372", "B00JJOY4RI", "B00008L3UQ", "B008SAPCTS", "B0003JANSW", "B003GWE582", "B000NTPG7K", "B005OT7ZWI", "B00005M2CO", "B00004XPPE", "B007HCI42A", "B00AEBB86U", "B000EHSVOG", "B0001FGBWK", "B0024FAG2Q", "B001NY4WYC", "0767824555", "B004GW49K0", "B00319ECCY", "B000HT38CQ", "B00005JMA5", "0783230346", "B0045HCJKS", "B0009GX1CE", "B001T21R50", "B004I1K05W", "B00G575PD4", "B00004ZBVG", "B00AIBZMD6", "B000P0J0BU", "B00005V9HJ", "B00008438U", "B00021R7CG", "B00005LIRC", "B0053ENPPA", "B003A0H04Q", "B0007ZEOC8", "B000QUCRB4", "B00005YUNO", "B005152C9G", "B00AEFY6DI", "B00AEFY9YY", "B004MFFB4O", "B00AEFY0KW", "B0000AMRUP", "B00BWJQEFS", "B001CQONHM", "B000E6ESEO", "B00AEFYTMQ", "B00A50PDS4", "B004I1K066", "B00008G6E8", "B0001FGC1U", "B000N3SROA", "B000O599YY", "B000TUDBFC", "0792844017", "B000AQKU72", "B00018D3YG", "B00501SPQA", "B000EXDSCU", "B003GWF2QQ", "B0006B2A42", "6305161984", "B00BWJQEFI", "B000M341R8", "B003B3NV8G", "B00AEFYR3C", "B00006FD9O", "078323208X", "B001EKP5D2", "B00CSW0A8A", "B004VT9JMG", "B00AEFY3TA", "B005DL6PLY", "B0077HQCYM", "B003VJTGNE", "B00005LC4D", "B00BCMT2BI", "B000EHSVSC", "B00008MTVY", "B00BCMT3TO", "B00005UQ9T", "B002EAYDQ6", "B000F6ZIIS", "B00DOZNJ2Y", "B0007PALZW", "B00AEFXLKC"], "bought_together": ["B00AEFXJF4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AEFXJF4", "B00AEFYTMQ", "B0001FGC1U", "B0033YFI6Q"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 163962}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.41, "brand": "UNI DIST CORP.

{"description": "Robin Williams won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor, and actors Matt Damon and Ben Affleck nabbed one for Best Original Screenplay, but the feel-good hitGood Will Huntingtriumphs because of its gifted director, Gus Van Sant. The unconventional director (My Own Private Idaho,Drugstore Cowboy) saves a script marred by vanity and clunky character development by yanking soulful, touching performances out of his entire cast (amazingly, even one by Williams that's relatively schtick-free). Van Sant pulls off the equivalent of what George Cukor accomplished for women's melodrama in the '30s and '40s: He's crafted an intelligent, unabashedly emotional male weepie about men trying to find inner-wisdom.Matt Damon stars as Will Hunting, a closet math genius who ignores his gift in favor of nightly boozing and fighting with South Boston buddies (co-writer Ben Affleck among them). While working as a university janitor, he solves an impossible calculus problem scribbled on a hallway blackboard and reluctantly becomes the prodigy of an arrogant MIT professor (Stellan Skarsg&#229;rd). Damon only avoids prison by agreeing to see psychiatrists, all of whom he mocks or psychologically destroys until he meets his match in the professor's former childhood friend, played by Williams. Both doctor and patient are haunted by the past, and as mutual respect develops, the healing process begins. The film's beauty lies not with grand climaxes, but with small, quiet moments. Scenes such as Affleck's clumsy pep talk to Damon while they drink beer after work, or any number of therapy session between Williams and Damon offer poignant looks at the awkward ways men show affection and feeling for one another.--Dave McCoy", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000FVQLQQ", "B000P0J0EW", "6305144168", "B0043X1FL8", "B00000IQV7", "B00AEFY0F2", "B0000YEEGM", "B00JPQ1INI", "B004FQX5B6", "0800141741", "B00011CZRE", "B00AEFXESQ", "B00562D3Y2", "B00125WAWS", "0783226845", "B003ASLJQS", "B00005JLRZ", "B000M341QE", "B0034G4P7G", "B002ZG99N6", "B000N4RAR4", "0767811100", "6305428352", "B000P0J0EM", "B00009W5CA", "B002NZK5UK", "B003ASLJO0", "B00003CWQR", "B004SIP7VM", "B000B8QG22", "B00005V9HH", "B001F34HRS", "B004AOECXI", "B000N6U0E2", "B00AEFXYJA", "079284646X", "B0043X1FM2", "B00AEFY17E", "B000066HAS", "B000PHVZNE", "B003AWRMC4", "B00000G3PA", "B00AEBB9F0", "B00005JKWX", "B000MZHW40", "B000Z8GZYW", "B0018CWW5K", "B000P0J0C4", "B000P0J09M", "B00004BZIY", "B00B0U2SFE", "B003AWRMCE", "B00001ZWUS", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00005B6JZ", "B00005JLSB", "B0002ZDVEU", "6305428271", "B000FKO5QK", "B00AEBB9SM", "B00007GZR5", "B001SN78JO", "B000QQLVPQ", "630587493X", "B0001ADAVK", "B004WCTLNY", "0792843592", "B00AEBBA36", "B000FVQLRA", "B00AEFXXMI", "B000XJD33O", "B0002WZTOI", "B00004XPPG", "B00008G8M4", "B00AEBB9LO", "B000056VP4", "B006VRRGNK", "6305313687", "B0006FYOTC", "B001QERPAC", "B002O3Z4WK", "B001680M26", "B00AEFY4CG", "B000YDBPAM", "B0068FZ0GK", "0767836359", "B00005JN2Z", "B000765IJK", "B00008NFR4", "630471193X", "B002NZK5VO", "B000EGDB10", "B000068MBX", "B00000J122", "B00AMSLDTM", "B000MNOX94", "B000R4SMCW", "B00009AOBI", "B000XR9L50", "B00005JOC9"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000P0J0EW", "B000M341QE", "0783226845", "B002ZG99N6"]}, "price": 8.67, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 107799}, "asin": "0788814664", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51EQNMPT51L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Good Will Hunting"}
{"description": "Peter Panhas a special place in the realm of classic animated  Disney films: it instills an element of childlike wonder. The 1953 version of James M. Barrie's story is colorfully told and keeps on the straight and narrow of the book. Barrie's wondrous focus on child's play is the key to its longevity: kids who don't grow up, shadows that run away from their owners, pirates, a fairy, and the magic ability to fly. In short, you can't help wishing the adventure would happen to you. Fueled by a few memorable songs (the stunner being \"You Can Fly\") and the strong impression of the pixie fairy Tinkerbell and the goofy Captain Hook, Disney's version of this story neither supplants nor lessens the Broadway version with Mary Martin that was produced for television the same decade. Unlike some classics,Peter Pannever ages along the way.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302642248", "0788812807", "0788802194", "155890641X", "0788812408", "0788806270", "6302320402", "6304401132", "6304500831", "6302526574", "6303314015", "6302787068", "6300274268", "6300274195", "B000035Z2S", "6305229449", "0788805843", "6304089767", "6302178924", "6303983812", "6302961572", "6300275310", "6304400551", "B0000AQZYM", "6305319138", "B00005JKDQ", "0788803743", "B00005JKX3", "0788805533", "6304290888", "6303929338", "B00003CX7L", "6305326940", "6304100507", "6302158095", "6304400225", "6305940932", "B00004R99N", "6301390725", "B00003CXQX", "B00000ICHA", "6303534422", "B00005JL95", "6304501153", "6304978286", "6302426200", "0788812440", "6301991311", "6304089201", "6300274608", "B00003CXHR", "B00005RDVV", "B00005T7H6", "6302484359", "B00000JS61", "6303036813", "6305942285", "1558906150", "B0000E32WB", "B00005RRG3", "B00004R99I", "B003H9M1Q2", "6304873441", "1558901892", "B000035Z46", "B00335EQ0E", "B00005K9OA", "B00003CWPW", "B00005LL26", "0788811002", "0788807307", "6304400381", "0788810634", "B00CTQWJEI", "B00016JF2W", "B00004REYY", "6304155972", "6304401736", "0788812181", "B00005RRG6", "6303122647", "B000JBWWRO", "B000B8QG4A", "6303939015", "B0000VV4W2", "B00EV1YZ96", "B000009CTR", "B00003CXQ6", "B00000J2JA", "630169774X", "B0000524CZ", "B000028U3S", "B00GDT5T9Y", "0790748266", "B00005RRG5", "B0013ND30M", "6303486894", "6304492952", "B001ILFUDC"], "bought_together": ["6302642248", "155890641X"], "also_viewed": ["0788802194", "0788806270", "6302642248", "0788812408", "6304500831", "155890641X", "6302320402", "0788812807", "6304401132", "6303314015", "6302526574", "0788805843", "6302787068", "6300274195", "6304290888", "B000035Z2S", "6303983812", "0788805533", "6300275310", "6304089767", "6300274268", "6302178924", "6305319138", "6302158095", "6302961572", "6303534422", "6305229449", "6303929338", "B00005JKDQ", "6304100507", "6305326940", "B00003CXQX", "B0000AQZYM", "6304400551", "B00004R99N", "6305940932", "6304978286", "B00003CX7L", "B00005JL95", "6303036813", "6302426200", "6304400225", "B000FP5PPA", "6304501153", "B000B8QG4A", "B0007KTBIU", "6301991311", "6301390725", "B003ZHVJGO", "B00005JKX3", "0788812440", "6304089201", "B00GDT4M1A", "B00335EQ0E", "B0000524CZ", "B0000E32WB", "6304873441", "B0001HAISG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 31071}, "categories": [["CDs & Vinyl", "Children's Music", "Disney"], ["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.89, "brand": "Disney", "asin": "078881172X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51A4yXnL4YL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Peter Pan (45th Anniversary Limited Edition) [VHS]"}

{"description": "The most viscerally frightening and disturbing homicidal-maniac picture sinceThe Silence of the Lambs,Sevenis based on an idea that's both gruesome and ingenious. A serial killer forces each of his victims to die by acting out one of the seven deadly sins. The murder scene is then artfully arranged into a grotesque tableau, a graphic illustration of each mortal vice. From the jittery opening credits to the horrifying (and seemingly inescapable) concluding twist, director David Fincher immerses us in a murky urban twilight where everything seems to be rotting, rusting, or molding; the air is cold and heavy with dread. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt are the detectives who skillfully track down the killer--all the while unaware that he has been closing in on them, as well. Gwyneth Paltrow and Kevin Spacey are also featured, but it is director Fincher and the ominous, overwhelmingly oppressive atmosphere of doom that he creates that are the real stars of the film. It's a terrific date movie--for vampires.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005V9HH", "B0007DFJ0G", "B000M341QE", "0783240295", "B00003CXZ4", "6305313687", "B004SIP8ZM", "B000P0J0EW", "B000LP6KNU", "B000P0J09M", "B000P0J0AG", "B000069HZP", "B004SIP95G", "B0009A40ES", "B0007PALZ2", "B002NZK5RI", "B002AF4Y9G", "B00AEBB89W", "B004SIP7VM", "B00AEFXQ9S", "B00004BZIY", "B003ASLJO0", "B00003CXWV", "B00096S49Y", "B00AEFYF2K", "B004SIP7ZS", "B00AEBB8NI", "B00008975Z", "B002T9H2LA", "B00005JLKN", "B000LC55F2", "0767802519", "B004FQX5B6", "B002VWNIEA", "B004SIP7TE", "B004SIP9Z6", "B00AEFXEGS", "0792846435", "B00003CXSP", "B002VWNICC", "B00AEFXT1S", "B000C20VPA", "B00AEFXESQ", "B000P0J0EM", "B000093FLA", "B002ZG99N6", "B002NZK5VO", "B003LR5BD0", "B002VWNIDG", "B000I2J736", "B0001FR3IQ", "B00AEFYYH6", "B000F5GNX8", "B002ZG980U", "B00005JN0W", "B00005JMJG", "B0000AC8LR", "B003ASLJQI", "B000E5N684", "B002XMGGK6", "B003HKN52U", "B00AP2DC94", "B00001ZWUS", "B000A2UBN4", "B000244GCW", "B000A7DVR2", "B002GHHHN8", "B00004WG2F", "B00AEFXKUI", "B001R3YRG2", "B002NZK5UU", "B00004XPPG", "B0034G4P7G", "B000FKO5QK", "B0009MDPYM", "B000NVT0SO", "B003ASLJQS", "B00005JPD0", "B00005JKWX", "B000YAF4MA", "B00005JKIS", "6305065551", "0783229526", "0783233477", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B002CPMB9O", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00005JA8B", "B00AEFXYJA", "B0000YEEGM", "B007D5E7C2", "B0002V7ON8", "B000N6U0E2", "B00AEFY5B6", "B00AEBB8LA", "6305718954", "B002AT8K9W", "B00AMSLDTM", "B000FS9FCG"], "bought_together": ["B0007DFJ0G", "6305313687"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004LWZW4M", "B00005V9HH", "B0007DFJ0G", "B000P0J0EW"]}, "price": 13.96, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 172718}, "asin": "0790729989", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51VQ890AJML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Seven (Widescreen)"}
{"description": "When Ridley Scott's cut ofBlade Runnerwas finally released in 1993, one had to wonder why the studio hadn't done it right the first time--11 years earlier. This version is so much better, mostly because of what's been eliminated (the ludicrous and redundant voice-over narration and the phony happy ending) rather than what's been added (a bit more character development and a brief unicorn dream). Star Harrison Ford originally recorded the narration under duress at the insistence of Warner Bros. executives who thought the story needed further \"explanation\"; he later confessed that he thought if he did it badly they wouldn't use it. (Moral: Never overestimate the taste of movie executives.) The movie's spectacular futuristic vision of Los Angeles--a perpetually dark and rainy metropolis that's the nightmare antithesis of \"Sunny Southern California\"--is still its most seductive feature, an otherworldly atmosphere in which you can immerse yourself. The movie's shadowy visual style, along with its classic private-detective/murder-mystery plot line (with Ford on the trail of a murderous android, or \"replicant\"), makesBlade Runnerone of the few science fiction pictures to legitimately claim a place in the film noir tradition. And, as in the best noir, the sleuth discovers a whole lot more (about himself and the people he encounters) than he anticipates.... With Sean Young, Edward James Olmos, Daryl Hannah, Rutger Hauer, and M. Emmet Walsh.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783225903", "B004L9GMBC", "0783226063", "B00000ILDD", "0800195175", "B0018O4YT0", "B0007PALZ2", "B00004Y87O", "B003ELKNH2", "B00AEFYDM2", "B0002CHIKG", "B00005ATQB", "B00005JL78", "0790729342", "B0045HCJKS", "0767830555", "B0002CHK1S", "B00005N5S5", "B000063JDE", "B000P0J0AQ", "B00005R2IS", "B0013LL2Z2", "B00I9TDMRM", "B0045HCJ9O", "B008MIMWP8", "B0045HCJ0S", "B00005JLWN", "B00005N7Z1", "B000YBKO6U", "B0006GAOJA", "B0007DFJ0G", "B001WLMOL4", "B00003CXXP", "6304698798", "B00000JSJC", "B000286RP2", "B003AWRMCE", "B0040QYROA", "0783228457", "B004SIP9Z6", "B002ZG980U", "079284646X", "B00079Z9VO", "B002VWNIAY", "B00005J75F", "B005LAIHXQ", "B000VECAD0", "B0000VCZK2", "B00005PJ8T", "0345404475", "B001DJLD1M", "0792839056", "B0045HCJ9E", "B0050FXDDQ", "B0045HCJGC", "B004SIP95G", "B007STBUHI", "B00006ADD5", "B00GHJ1YUI", "B003ZXDP0Q", "B000A7DVR2", "0790731932", "B000NA1WGS", "B00AMSLDTM", "B008JFUN50", "B0068FZ0O2", "B000QUCQX8", "B000E6ESEO", "B00AEFXN9G", "B004FQX5B6", "B0002KVUKM", "B0016I0AJG", "B007FQXEWI", "B000N6TX1I", "B002VWNIDG", "B00ENNBZ68", "B00K5EJHGO", "B001VLBDD0", "078401213X", "0780022343", "B0018CMJSU", "B005LAII3A", "B000OVLBHG", "B006TTC5HC", "B0049985XW", "B0000844I8", "B00005JKFR", "B00AEFY3MC", "B000BZISSU", "0783226837", "6305133476", "B000022TSY", "B000FS9FCG", "B00070FX5U", "B008MIMWQW", "B00AEBBADG", "B004GJYRKA", "B002Z7FWBI", "B000BR9S96", "B00000K3TS"], "bought_together": ["B004L9GMBC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005LAIHXQ", "B009JBWOU0", "B00HUCF7AO", "B0018O4YT0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 68358}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 10.21, "brand": "WARNER BROTHERS", "asin": "0790729628", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ST8TQP63L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)"}

{"description": "Whether or not you can sympathize with its fascistic-vigilante approach to law enforcement,Dirty Harry(directed by star Clint Eastwood's longtime friend and directorial mentor, Don Siegel) is one hell of a cop thriller. The movie makes evocative use of its San Francisco locations as cop Harry Callahan (Eastwood) tracks the elusive &quot;Scorpio killer&quot; who has been terrorizing the city by the Bay. As the psychopath's trail grows hotter, Harry becomes increasingly impatient and intolerant of the frustrating obstacles (departmental red tape, individuals' civil rights) that he feels are keeping him from doing his job. A characteristically taut and tense piece of filmmaking from Siegel (Invasion of the Body Snatchers,The Shootist,Escape from Alcatraz), it also remains a fascinating slice of American pop culture. It was a big hit (followed by four sequels) that obviously reflected--or exploited--the almost obsessive or paranoid fears and frustrations many Americans felt about crime in the streets. At a time when &quot;law and order&quot; was a familiar slogan for political candidates, Harry Callahan may have represented neither, but from his point of view his job was simple: stop criminals. To him that end justified any means he deemed necessary.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["0790733390", "079073172X", "6300216500", "0792836510", "6300269043", "0790751216", "0792837312", "6302890721", "079284100X", "6302054982", "6304429711", "0784011923", "6302610702", "6302360978", "6300182452", "0792110188", "6300263673", "B000005PF5", "0792835077", "B0000068SI", "6303020089", "630442972X", "6300214826", "6300183211", "B000003KDG", "6301976061", "B00000J2KZ", "630118663X", "0790734079", "6303212263", "6300214060", "6301327845", "0783222955", "6300271331", "B00000K2SC", "0792842464", "B000005PJ6", "6304437315", "0792133153", "6301802330", "6304025831", "6300181405", "6302787564", "0790735423", "6303029027", "0792108868", "0790751267", "6304509154", "0790705141", "B000007OY0", "6300269639", "0800100832", "6303686796", "630281622X", "6304258984", "079284517X", "0792839234", "6303920098", "0792110285", "6305622825", "6302712009", "0790733927", "6301586026", "0800125762", "6302596092", "630018224X", "0790748169", "0792839846", "6301971809", "6303506291", "6305576173", "0783223218", "6300214540", "0783241542", "6303313345"], "bought_together": ["0790733390"], "also_viewed": ["079073172X", "B005GJTZZG", "0790737744", "0790751267", "0792836510", "630118663X", "0790733390"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 365837}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.94, "brand": "", "asin": "0790731975", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41VY4VS01BL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Dirty Harry [VHS]"}

The Witches of Eastwick to the better actor-and came up with the sleekest, sexiest supernatural comedy/thriller to emerge from this or any other world, earning Nicholson 1987 Best Actor Awards from the New York and Los Angeles Film Critics. The \"witches\" are in three modern-day women yearning for Mr. Right in a quaint New England town full of Mr. Uptights. Played glowingly by Cher (Moonstruck), Susan Sarandon (Lorenzo's Oil) and Michelle Pfeiffer (The Age of Innocence), they're lovely enough to tempt even the most jaded netherworld denizen.

{"description": "The last film completed by Bruce Lee before his untimely death,Enter the Dragonwas his entr&eacute;e into Hollywood. The American-Hong Kong coproduction, shot in Asia by American director Robert Clouse, stars Lee as a British agent sent to infiltrate the criminal empire of bloodthirsty Asian crime lord Han (Shih Kien) through his annual international martial arts tournament. Lee spends his days taking on tournament combatants and nights breaking into the heavily guarded underground fortress, kicking the living tar out of anyone who stands in his way. The mix of kung fu fighting (choreographed by Lee himself) and James Bond intrigue (the plot has more than a passing resemblance toDr. No) is pulpy by any standard, but the generous budget and talented cast of world-class martial artists puts this film in a category well above Lee's earlier Hong Kong productions. Unfortunately he's off the screen for large chunks of time as American maverick competitors (and champion martial artists) John Saxon and Jim Kelly take center stage, but once the fighting starts Lee takes over. The tournament setting provides an ample display of martial arts mastery of many styles and climaxes with a huge free-for-all, but the highlight is Lee's brutal one-on-one with the claw-fisted Han in the dynamic hall-of-mirrors battle. Lee narrows his eyes and tenses into a wiry force of sinew, speed, and ruthless determination.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300250164", "6301163796", "6300250172", "6305508534", "6300250156"], "bought_together": ["6300250164", "6300250172"], "also_viewed": ["6300250164", "6305519471", "6300250172"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 109259}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.95, "brand": "", "asin": "0790735172", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51X0KFFZYFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Enter the Dragon [VHS]"}
{"description": "Philip Kaufman's intimate epic about theMercuryastronauts (based on Tom Wolfe's book) was one of the most ambitious and spectacularly exciting movies of the 1980s.  It surprised almost everybody by not becoming a smash hit. By all rights, the film should have been every bit the success thatApollo 13would later become;The Right Stuffis not only just as thrilling, but it is also a bigger and better movie. Combining history (both established and revisionist), grand mythmaking (and myth puncturing), adventure, melodrama, behind-the-scenes dish, spectacular visuals, and a down-to-earth sense of humor,The Right Stuffchronicles NASA's efforts to put a man in orbit. Such an achievement would be the first step toward President Kennedy's goal of reaching the moon, and, perhaps most important of all, would win a crucial public relations/morale victory over the Soviets, who had delivered a stunning blow to American pride by launchingSputnik, the first satellite. The movie contrasts the daring feats of the unsung test pilots--one of whom, Chuck Yeager, embodied more than anyone else the skill and spirit of Wolfe's title--against the heavily publicized (and sanitized) accomplishments of theMercuryastronauts. Through no fault of their own, the spacemen became prisoners of the heroic images the government created for them in order to capture the public's imagination. The casting is inspired; the film features Sam Shepard as the legendary Yeager, Ed Harris as John Glenn, Dennis Quaid as &quot;Gordo&quot; Cooper, Scott Glenn as Alan Shepard, Fred Ward as Gus Grissom, Scott Wilson as Scott Crossfield, and Pamela Reed and Veronica Cartwright are superb in their thankless roles as astronauts' wives.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783225733", "B0006FYOTC", "B002O3Z4QQ", "B001BEK8CY", "B002NHX1YK", "B003AWRMBA", "0312427565", "B000XJ5TPE", "B00008K76U", "B00005J760", "B000CEXEWA", "B004L9GMBC", "B002GHHHKQ", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00004XPPC", "B001O4C6K8", "B0045HCJ9O", "B00BTYOYK8", "B000FTCLR6", "B0002V7OI8", "B00005JPLE", "0792838408", "0812992520", "B00080ETMM", "B000055Y0X", "B00AEFYBA6", "B000V7O0DU", "B004AOECXI", "B0015NORDW", "B000EHSVS2", "B00371QQ2U", "0767802470", "B00066FBQG", "B00A33J8YS", "B0006B2A42", "B00080ZG10", "B00319ECI8", "B00AEFXVOI", "B00008G8M4", "B007N31YH0", "B00AEFYENK", "B003ASLJRC", "B004FQX5A2", "B0000JBALO", "B000E1NXJ0", "B00004U2MS", "B000MNOX94", "B0026IQTR2", "B00003CWU3", "B00000G3PA", "B0026VBOJC", "B008JZRMQI", "B00003CXHJ", "0553256742", "B00008G8LY", "B00005T7HZ", "0743200799", "0553050931", "B000FZETR0", "B000EHSVSC", "B0000694Z3", "0783225547", "B0002WZTOI", "B002O3Z50G", "1439148813", "6305428514", "B0068FZ0GK", "B00003CXA6", "B0001NBMH6", "B00026L9CU", "B000YAF4MA", "B002GHHHPQ", "B0087ZG7HK", "B000KX0IOA", "B0001US66Y"], "bought_together": ["0783225733", "B0006FYOTC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0783225733", "B002ZNJXP8", "B003AWRMBA", "B0002WZTOI"]}, "price": 15.95, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 149633}, "asin": "0790731541", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516l1sshrEL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Right Stuff"}

The movie begins by soaring far out into space, then returns dizzyingly to earth until all the stars in the heavens condense into the sparkle in one little girl's eye.

{"description": "This big and sometimes messy movie achieves the seemingly impossible: it demythologizes the American Revolution and lets us see it in a completely new light. Hugh Hudson (Chariots of Fire) has directed a starkly beautiful, powerfully visceral portrait of war from the point of view of the  little people who are swept along in its wake. Al Pacino is Tom Dobb, a poor,  illiterate trapper bringing up a young son when rebellion breaks out in New  York. Dobb's small boat is requisitioned for the war effort, and he and his son  become reluctant conscripts. It takes six months and some truly vile treatment  by the British before the conflict becomes personal for Dobb and he makes the American cause his own. The Dobb family's tale intersects that of British Sergeant Major Peasy (a formidable Donald Sutherland) and his own son. As the tide of the war turns, the enemies' fortunes are reversed. Tom's love interest, Daisy McConnahay (Nastassja Kinski), is a fiery beauty who breaks from her family of wealthy Tories (British sympathizers) to fight for freedom. Kinski is wonderful as a living Lady Liberty, and Pacino has some extraordinary moments of raw emotion as Dobb. The film's highlights include authentic, grisly re-creations of famous Revolutionary War battles, including Yorktown and Valley Forge. This movie will draw you in, gradually but inexorably, as it creates its convincing and compelling world.--Laura Mirsky", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 419750}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 13.98, "brand": "", "asin": "0790741970", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/513ENNQ4AKL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Revolution [VHS]"}

Two hard-luck drifters (Bogart and Holt) and a grizzled prospector (Huston) discover gold.

{"description": "Mel Gibson's Oscar-winning 1995Braveheartis an impassioned epic about William Wallace, the 13th-century Scottish leader of a popular revolt against England's tyrannical Edward I (Patrick McGoohan). Gibson cannily plays Wallace as a man trying to stay out of history's way until events force his hand, an attribute that instantly resonates with several of the actor's best-known roles, especiallyMad Max. The subsequent camaraderie and courage Wallace shares in the field with fellow warriors is pure enough and inspiring enough to bring envy to a viewer, and even as things go wrong for Wallace in the second half, the film does not easily cave in to a somber tone. One of the most impressive elements is the originality with which Gibson films battle scenes, featuring hundreds of extras wielding medieval weapons. After Eisenstein'sAlexander Nevsky, Orson Welles'sChimes at Midnight, and even Kenneth Branagh'sHenry V, you might think there is little new that could be done in creating scenes of ancient combat; yet Gibson does it.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00004XPQ6", "B00003CXE6", "6303953425", "6304935811", "B0001VL30O", "B000054OW2", "6302415853", "0790741512", "6304071876", "6301792734", "6303168507", "6303942830", "0800125762", "6300183211", "B000007OY0", "B000056BRF", "6300214540", "B000065U6Q", "B00004WIDB", "B00003CXTF", "B00007KK15", "079070546X", "B0000A36J1", "B00000K3AN", "6302482712", "6300263673", "6305169187", "0788811355", "B00003BE3X", "0800116917", "6304414099", "6303020089", "0792133153", "0790744589", "6302909023", "0800132009", "079212569X", "6300185095", "6303313345", "0767819462", "6304259131", "B00000K2SC", "0800199421", "B0001DI5W6", "B00005JLTM", "630018224X", "0790701251", "6304151306", "6303696813", "0790731274", "0792147618", "B00005RIJ3", "6301586026", "6302945089", "0783223218", "6305718792"], "bought_together": ["B00004XPQ6", "B00003CXE6"], "also_viewed": ["0792151712", "6303314015", "6301966988", "6303402348", "B00004WIDB", "0792116887", "6300213668", "0800125762", "B00004XPQ6", "0792842111", "B00003CXTF", "0788812408", "6302526574", "6303215734", "0788806270", "6300183211", "B00004U8P4", "0788802194"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 521725}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 0.5, "brand": "", "asin": "0792139771", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51PF2QYK62L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Braveheart (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]"}

{"description": "The 18th James Bond adventure was a runaway box-office success when released in 1995, thanks to the arrival of Pierce Brosnan as the fifth actor (following the departure of Timothy Dalton) to play the suave, danger-loving Agent 007. This James Bond is a bit more vulnerable and psychologically complex--and just a shade more politically correct--but he's still a formally attired playboy at heart, with a lovely Russian beauty (Izabella Scorupco) as his sexy ally against a cadre of renegade Russians bent on--what else?--global domination. There's also a seductive villainous with the suggestive name of Xenia Onatopp (Famke Janssen), and the great actress Judi Dench makes her first appearance as Bond's superior, M, who wisecracks about 007's &quot;dinosaur&quot; status as a globetrotting sexist. All in all, this action-packed Bond adventure provided a much-needed boost the long-running movie series, revitalizing the 007 franchise for the turn of the millennium.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000RPCK1U", "B000NIBURQ", "B001EDVNNU", "B000NDEXPM", "B000M53GMW", "B000RPCK24", "B000RPCK1K", "B000RPCK1A", "B001R10BN2", "B000NIBURG", "B000NIBUR6", "B000M53GN6", "B000M53GLS", "B000NIBUS0", "B000M53GNG", "B000RPCK0Q", "B000NDEXPC", "B000M53GMC", "B00AQSN7HE", "B001PPLIEG", "B00004RG62", "B00004WEJZ", "B007REV4T8", "B00005JL0I", "B008YAPQX4", "B009PN18R2", "B009PN3OD8", "B004BR7XLM", "B00AZFECL8", "0767803434", "6305657947", "B0014Z4ON4", "B004P7CN3G", "B0000BYRO9", "B000SK5Z70", "B000EGDB10", "B00005N5S5", "B000ENC5YW", "B002GHHHME", "B00008K76U", "B00000JQB5", "B000RW3VCK", "B00AEFXKUI", "B0002S94CK", "B0014C2FX8", "B000JYW5BE", "B004LWZW6K", "B0015XHQT4", "B008YAPRBU", "B000ARXF96", "B0014Z4OMU", "6305133476", "B000N3SSBW", "B00026ZG10", "B0000VD12I", "B003XURDAY", "B0046MOVE4", "B00005A3KS", "B0002I84N0", "B000WP07F6", "B0007KZQAM", "0783225547", "B00000BLFI", "B00AEFYBA6", "B00005PJ8S", "B00AVWIQZS", "B00003CXC5", "B00011CZRE", "B00008G8M4", "B004EPYZUS", "B004IK30MI", "079284646X", "B00595W3QK", "B00AEBB8VK", "B00000G3PA", "B000FO0AA6", "B00AEFYDM2", "B008JFUS0U", "B006TTC5WC", "B00008K76W", "B0000BYRO7", "B001FB55HQ", "B000EHSVSC", "B0036TGSR6", "B00EALTW3G", "B002I9Z8BM", "B002GOAH1A", "B00096S4BM", "6304765258", "6304698801", "B000AP04FG", "B00407PNWO", "B00AIBZMD6", "B00005JN2Z", "0790729997", "B00GHH9GXC", "B002ZG98LO", "B000HRMAPE", "0783226012"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000M53GN6", "B000RPCK0Q", "B00I9TDMCM", "B001R10BN2"]}, "price": 12.49, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 255435}, "asin": "079283318X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DZYMD2RDL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "GoldenEye (Special Edition)"}

{"description": "Harry Hook's adaptation is not as faithful to the William Golding novel as you'd wish (they excised theLord of the Fliesdialogue with Simon!) and because of it, the movie is less allegorical and less resonant. A group of young men from a military academy are stranded on an island. The group quickly becomes fractious with a passive section led by Ralph, trying to get rescued, and a hunter faction, led by Jack, trying to procure meat and \"have fun.\" Peter Brook's 1963 filming seemed to get closer to the Darwinist sense of this cultural disintegration. Here, the hunter faction seems more like Peter Pan's Lost Boys than the bloodthirsty murderers they are. The performances, particularly young Getty, don't quite carry the weight of the situation. It's still, however, sobering to slowly watch the school uniforms traded for war paint, and the little boys turn into little savages.--Keith Simanton", "related": {"also_viewed": ["6302891256", "B001BEK8EW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 338425}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 17.99, "brand": "", "asin": "0792840941", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51YZDPH135L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Lord of the Flies [VHS]"}
{"description": "Rain Manis the kind of touching drama that Oscars are made for--and, sure enough, the film took Academy honors for best picture, director, screenplay, and actor (Dustin Hoffman) in 1988.

This gets the attention of his materialistic younger brother, a hot-shot LA car dealer named Charlie (Tom Cruise) who wasn't even aware of Raymond's existence until he read his estranged father's will. Charlie picks up Raymond and takes him on a cross-country journey that becomes a voyage of discovery for Charlie, and, perhaps, for Raymond, too.Rain Manwill either captivate you or irritate you (Raymond's sputtering of repetitious phrases is enough to drive anyone crazy), but it is obviously a labor of love for those involved. Hoffman had been attached to the film for many years, as various directors and writers came and went, but his persistence eventually paid off--kind of like Raymond in Las Vegas.

{"description": "A box-office hit when released in 1994, this sprawling, frequently overwrought familial melodrama may get sillier as its plot progresses, but it's the kind of lusty, character-based epic that Hollywood should attempt more often. It's also an unabashedly flattering star vehicle for Brad Pitt as Tristan--the rebellious middle son of a fiercely independent Montana rancher and military veteran (Anthony Hopkins)--who is routinely at odds with his more responsible older brother, Alfred (Aidan Quinn), and younger brother, Samuel (Henry Thomas). From the battlefields of World War I to his adventures as an oceangoing sailor, Tristan's life is full of personal torment, especially when he returns to Montana and finds himself competing with Alfred over Samuel's beautiful widow (Julia Ormond), whose passion for Tristan disrupts the already turbulent Ludlow clan. Under the wide-open canopy of Big Sky country, this operatic tale unfolds with all the bloodlust, tragedy, and scenery-chewing performances you'd expect to find in a hokey bestselling novel (in fact, it's based on the acclaimed novella by Jim Harrison), but it's a potent mix that's highly entertaining. Not surprisingly, John Toll won an Academy Award for his breathtaking outdoor cinematography.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0800121600", "0783230893", "6302415853", "B0000214F3", "B00329TVQA", "6301963911", "6304119046", "0790734079", "6300185095", "6300182304", "6304258984", "6304147139", "1558807381", "6301586026"], "bought_together": ["0800121600"], "also_viewed": ["6302130379", "0767836359"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 342881}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.74, "brand": "", "asin": "0800135954", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HTKHKV7SL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Legends of the Fall [VHS]"}
{"description": "When Barbra Streisand played Fanny Brice inFunny Girl, she brought to life a sympathetic yet strong-headed performer of stage and radio. In the sequel,Funny Lady, Brice comes off as a harsher woman, slightly bitchy, without the tremendous charm she possessed in the first film. Herbert Ross takes over as director (William Wyler oversawFunny Girl), and the film just seems to get away from him. This sequel picks up during the Great Depression, when even the great star Fanny Brice is suffering. Along comes Billy Rose (James Caan), a small-time hustler who's out to make it big in show biz. The two pair up, both professionally and romantically, although things are uncertain when her first husband, Nick Arnstein (Omar Sharif), reappears on the scene. Much to the movie's detriment,Funny Ladyconcentrates more on Brice's professional life than on her personal life, as the first film does. The songs are elaborately staged numbers that Brice performs in the theaters, and while they are visually lush and spectacular, they lack conviction. Caan is solid in his role as the bumbling producer, but overall, the film is a disappointment. If you want more Barbra and Brice, rewatchFunny Girl.--Jenny Brown", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B00070HK24", "B00005O3VD", "B00005JL1P", "B0045HCJ7G", "B00001W9G0", "B00ECW9XEG", "B00005QCTZ", "B001UDOGSI", "B00006FDCE", "B00006FDCI", "B00005V3WI", "B001P5HI4A", "B001TH37SA", "B0087ITBPC", "B001VB8UAE", "B000056WR0", "B000059H73", "B000JJSJPK", "B00005JLIU", "B00AEFY0KW", "0800141849", "B000HT3PGU", "B0000844M8", "B000B9PW7G", "B000RPCK2E", "B00007GZR1", "B0001IXTF4", "B00005JN5E", "B00005T7I2", "B003NF97IU", "B000FL7CAK", "B003BZXHX8", "B003L16F7C", "B00005JNJV", "B007XTDWKQ", "B000YDBPAM", "B000AP04O2", "0547368925", "B009T6CXG0", "B00007LVCM", "B0007TKNII", "B002M2Z3BA", "B00BG0RSJ4", "B00CNW9ZI6", "B000Z63ZKG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00070HK24", "B00005O3VD", "B00005JL1P", "B0045HCJ7G"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 632885}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.95, "brand": "", "asin": "0800141393", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518G4GDK4KL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Funny Lady (VHS Tape) From the Streisand Collection"}
{"description": "Bill Murray does warmth in his most consistently effective post-Stripescomedy, a romantic fantasy about a wacky weatherman forced to relive one strange day over and over again, until he gets it right. Snowed in during a road-trip expedition to watch the famous groundhog encounter his shadow, Murray falls into a time warp that is never explained but pays off so richly that it doesn't need to be. The elaborate loop-the-loop plot structure cooked up by screenwriter Danny Rubin is crystal-clear every step of the way, but it's Murray's world-class reactive timing that makes the jokes explode, and we end up looking forward to each new variation. He squeezes all the available juice out of every scene. Without forcing the issue, he makes us understand why this fly-away personality responds so intensely to the radiant sanity of the TV producer played by Andie MacDowell. The blissfully clueless Chris Elliott (Cabin Boy) is Murray's nudnik cameraman.--David Chute", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00004RJ73", "B00287Z18Y", "6305609764", "B00005PJ6O", "B007P9HW3M", "0790740044", "B00AEFXXMI", "0783227388", "6305236569", "B00000IQBW", "B000E33W1W", "0804141444", "B0009RCPY8", "B0019HQICW", "B001AGXEAG", "B00AEFXDO6", "0767818105", "0792844890", "B002O3Z4YI", "B0000A14TA", "B0014Z4OMU", "B000K7VHTQ", "B00AEBBA2M", "B00005Y71F", "B00AEBB9SM", "B002GOAGZC", "B000G6BLW4", "B001IHJ988", "B00008G8LM", "B001LXIDVI", "B000QQLVPQ", "B005LL817W", "B001LMAK9W", "B00AEBB9DM", "0767806808", "B008R65XKQ", "B000G6BLWE", "B00003CXC3", "B00005O5CM", "B000065V3P", "B00005JM4Q", "B00AEBB9E6", "B000ELJAEM", "B00AEFYS2M", "B00AEFY0F2", "0767836324", "B002T51X4Q", "0800195175", "B0009X760U", "B000A3XYIM", "B000VBIGD6", "B000069HYF", "B00003CXR4", "0790742071", "B00AEFY3MC", "B000PHVZNE", "B0000YTP02", "B000E6ESI0", "B000YDBPAM", "B007Y1NR1W", "B00158K0QU", "B00006FMUW", "B00BLN4UPG", "B00AEFYM2S", "B000HT3PPG", "B000056HEA", "B000068NNU", "B0045HCJ7G", "B000V4UFZK", "B004GJYRA0", "B004AOECXI", "B000YAF4MA", "B00AEFXPG2", "B0045HCIY0"], "bought_together": ["B00004RJ73", "B00287Z18Y"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00004RJ73", "B00005PJ6O", "B000E33W1W", "B00287Z18Y"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 107101}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.42, "brand": "", "asin": "080017948X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21XPDM6RK1L.jpg", "title": "Groundhog Day"}
{"description": "This horrible misfire from the usually reliable writer-director Andrew Bergman (The Freshman) has nothing funny, provocative, timely, or interesting to say (despite being based on a novel by Carl Hiaasen) once Demi Moore gets her clothes off. Moore plays a single, unemployed mom caught up in a custody battle who elects to make some money by stripping at a club. The character's troubles don't end there, however: Her ex-husband is posing a threat, and a perverted congressman (Burt Reynolds) is looking for more than a lap dance. Bergman's great wit is nowhere in sight, and the film primarily becomes another opportunity for Moore to function like a special effect.

{"description": "With the knockout one-two punch of 1992'sReservoir Dogsand 1994'sPulp Fictionwriter-director Quentin Tarantino stunned the filmmaking world, exploding into prominence as a cinematic heavyweight contender. ButPulp Fictionwas more than just the follow-up to an impressive first feature, or the winner of the Palme d'Or at Cannes Film Festival, or a script stuffed with the sort of juicy bubblegum dialogue actors just love to chew, or the vehicle that reestablished John Travolta on the A-list, or the relatively low-budget ($8 million) independent showcase for an ultrahip mixture of established marquee names and rising stars from the indie scene (among them Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, Bruce Willis, Ving Rhames, Harvey Keitel, Christopher Walken, Tim Roth, Amanda Plummer, Julia Sweeney, Kathy Griffin, and Phil Lamar). It was more, even, than an unprecedented $100-million-plus hit for indie distributor Miramax.Pulp Fictionwas a sensation. No, it was not the Second Coming (I actually thinkReservoir Dogsis a more substantial film; and P.T. Anderson outdid Tarantino in 1997 by making his directorial debut with two even more mature and accomplished pictures,Hard EightandBoogie Nights). ButPulp Fictionpacks so much energy and invention into telling its nonchronologically interwoven short stories (all about temptation, corruption, and redemption amongst modern criminals, large and small) it leaves viewers both exhilarated and exhausted--hearts racing and knuckles white from the ride. (Oh, and the infectious, surf-guitar-based soundtrack is tastier than a Royale with Cheese.)--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00008975Z", "B007D5E7C2", "B004U7MR14", "B0007DFJ0G", "B002T9H2LA", "B002AF4Y9G", "B004SIP8ZM", "6305313687", "B000P0J09M", "B000P0J0EW", "B005LAIIJY", "B000A7DVR2", "B00005V9HH", "B00011CZRE", "B004FQX5B6", "B00005JMUA", "B000P0J0D8", "B004P7CN5O", "B0019L770A", "B004SIP9Z6", "B0009A40ES", "B00003CXWV", "B000C20VPA", "B000LP6KNU", "B00005JMEW", "B000C20VRS", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00AEFXESQ", "B002VWNIDG", "0767830555", "B000093FLA", "B00009W5CA", "B0019L21GA", "B0006GAOJA", "B000M341QE", "B00003CXZ4", "B003ELKNH2", "B000P0J09C", "B002VWNIEA", "B00004XPPB", "B00029RTAI", "0767802519", "0783229526", "B000R7HY0K", "B000002OTL", "B00AEBB8NI", "B004SIP7TE", "B008R65XYC", "B0018CMJSU", "B002ZG980U", "079284646X", "B00AEFXXMI", "B004SIP7ZS", "B004SIP6LS", "B00079Z9VO", "B00005ATQB", "B00005JN0W", "B00004Z1FX", "0792833279", "B000WZEZGI", "B00AEFYS2M", "B001AEF6BI", "B0057ZAA6W", "B000M7XRAG", "B00AEBB9CS", "B00AEFXN9G", "B000UAE7O0", "B000A2UBN4", "B002VWNICC", "B000FS9FCG", "B000IY04Q8", "B001G5T6GW", "B00005N5S5", "B00005JLSB", "B006TTC5HC", "B003XURDAY", "B0019L21H4", "B00006D295", "B000AXWHSA", "0792838076", "B0006HBZE2", "B000P0J0AG", "B0009UC810", "B0050FXDDQ", "B0000DI87S", "B00AEFYSEA", "B0087ZG7R0", "B002CPMB9O", "B00AEBB9ZK", "B000BKJ762", "0800195175", "B00AEBB9NM", "B00GMV8M2Y", "0767836286", "B00H9KKGTO", "B00000ILDD", "6305327041", "B004SIP6GI", "B00005JMJG", "B003ASLJO0"], "bought_together": ["B007D5E7C2", "B00008975Z"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B007D0FVRM", "B0007DFJ0G", "B005LAIIJY", "B002T9H2LA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 77305}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.49, "brand": "", "asin": "1558908242", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51WG6GXWSCL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Pulp Fiction"}

{"description": "The surprising truth about Disney's 1982 computer-game fantasy is that it's still visually impressive (though technologically quaint by later high-definition standards) and a lot of fun. It's about a computer wizard named Flynn (Jeff Bridges) who is digitally broken down into a data stream by a villainous software pirate (David Warner) and reconstituted into the internal, 3-D graphical world of computers. It is there, in the blazingly colorful, geometrically intense landscapes of cyberspace, that Flynn joins forces with Tron (Bruce Boxleitner) to outmaneuver the Master Control program that holds them captive in the equivalent of a gigantic, infinitely challenging computer game. Disney's wizards used a variety of cinematic techniques and early-'80s state-of-the-art computer-generated graphics to accomplish their dynamic visual goals, and the result was a milestone in cyberentertainment, catering to technogeeks while providing a dazzling adventure for hackers and nonhackers alike. Appearing just in time to celebrate the nascent cyberpunk movement in science fiction,Tronreceived a decidedly mixed reaction when originally released, but has since become a high-tech favorite and a landmark in special effects, with a loyal following of fans. DVD is a perfect format for the movie's neon-glow color scheme, and the musical score by synthesizer pioneer Wendy Carlos is faithfully preserved on the digitally remastered soundtrack.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002ZG99QS", "B0001I55SS", "B004K4IZ3G", "B008R65XN8", "B0024FADAQ", "B0015NORDW", "B0037KMHRY", "B003TEI3E4", "B0013LL2Z2", "B0030MOTNE", "B008JFUS0U", "B008JFUO72", "B006ZOFX7K", "6305047456", "142313463X", "B0045HCJ9O", "B0039MIPDA", "0783226063", "B002GHHHOM", "B00008OE4W", "B0090SI56Y", "B0001I562I", "B000056WR3", "B0045HCJKS", "B0042YXWUK", "B004VT9JLM", "B003RACGZM", "B000P0J06K", "B005LAIH2W", "B002HWRYJE", "B002SR6CIM", "B0038OMQPW", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B0038ZITIE", "B006VRRGNK", "B00K7IPFSM", "B0001Z37HM", "B004M20YDU", "B004J1P5RE", "B00AEFXT7W", "B00E5I2M6I", "B000VECAD0", "B00AZMFJYA", "B00005PJ6N", "B0030MOXA8", "B00E5I2M9K", "B0002J58GU", "B001PPLIEG", "B001O4KBPA", "B001GCUO1Q", "B000QXDCJ2", "B0038OMQNY", "B00005PJ6M", "B004LWZW42", "6305428514", "B00005JKFR", "B008JFUO36", "B00005JKU0", "B008JFUQZ2", "630469654X", "B00005JKEX", "B005LAII3A", "B00BEZTMFY", "B00005AB62", "B000HEVZ9E", "B001AGXEAG", "B00JPS7HOA", "B001FB55HQ", "B004L9GMBC", "B002GHHHKQ", "B001MWUWU8", "B00006JC48", "B005COPWZW", "B000SUKPL6", "B00000JPH6", "B004LWZWFQ"], "bought_together": ["B002ZG99QS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002ZG99QS", "B004OBQQRW", "B0044XV3R8", "B00I6JOD2S"]}, "price": 14.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 226749}, "asin": "1558908358", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GQ2WSNH5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Tron"}

{"description": "This 1985 adventure directed by Barry Levinson (Rain Man) and written  by Chris Columbus (Gremlins) may not have much to do with the Sherlock  Holmes of Arthur Conan Doyle's invention. But it is a delightful and somewhat  unexpected combination of exciting elements: Victorian-era, foggy-London  mystique, Gothic horror, and Indiana Jones-like exotica. Nicholas Rowe plays  Holmes as a schoolboy at a boarding academy for young men. Paired with the  owlish, reticent young Watson (Alan Cox), Holmes embarks on the solution of a  mystery that involves a hallucinatory and lethal drug, and a religious cult celebrating ancient Egyptian rites of mummification. Levinson makes handsome  and crisp work of this Steven Spielberg production, without a trace of the  treacle that often found its way into other Spielbergian projects at the time  (The Goonies). Rowe is wonderfully  convincing as a teen incarnation of the Great Detective, and while Cox mostly  maintains Hollywood's traditionally unflattering idea of Watson, he does  bring warmth and comedy to the role. The cast includes Freddie Jones as an  eccentric inventor, Anthony Higgins as the villain, and Sophie Ward as  Holmes's love interest.--Tom Keogh", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 536183}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.74, "brand": "", "asin": "6300214508", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51NPVMVW7WL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Young Sherlock Holmes [VHS]"}
{"description": "This splatter flick, along with John Carpenter'sHalloween, helped spawn the great horror-movie movement of the '80s, not to mentioneightsequels, many of which had nothing to do with the films that preceded them. It also gave birth to Jason Voorhees, one of the three biggest horror-movie psychos of the modern era (the other two beingHalloween's Michael Myers andA Nightmare on Elm Street's Freddy Krueger). Forever duplicated, the originalFriday the 13thpopularized a number of themes and techniques that today are now clich&eacute;s: the increasingly gory murders, the remote forest location, the anonymous and nubile cast, the murderer as cult hero, and, of course, the moral that if you have sex, you will die, very painfully. Still, if you have to see aFriday the 13thmovie, this is the one to check out. A group of eager (and horny) teenagers decide to reopen Camp Crystal Lake, which 20 years earlier was closed after the shocking and mysterious murders of two amorous camp counselors. You can take it from there, as the teens get picked off one by one, during a dark and stormy night; of course, their car won't start and there's no phone. The ending stole shamelessly from Brian De Palma'sCarrie, but it still provides a slight if campy shock. Look for a young Kevin Bacon as the requisite stud--you can tell that's what he is because when the cast appears in swimsuits, he's wearing a Speedo--who's the beneficiary of the film's best murder sequence, an arrowhead to the throat. Right after having sex, of course.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300214192", "6300214311", "6300189015", "6300214605", "B00023NRSM", "6301589025", "6301094352", "6300218058", "6302921058", "6305095566", "630428845X", "6300214656", "6300267881", "0792839234", "6304288433", "B00000JQTO", "6304136242", "0780627032", "6302038308", "6302975832", "0792846311", "6303917283", "6301562925", "0784011923", "0790705141", "B000AMW2TK", "B00005B238", "0783216084", "0764005693", "B0013D8LAE", "6304509154", "630130053X", "B000VKL6Z2", "630196666X", "6303396585", "B00IF8Q0YE", "6303579388", "6300182878", "6303265715", "6304983794", "6300214176", "6302180015", "6304361025", "6304509146", "6300262855", "B00008HCCJ", "0792836634", "6302516919", "6300146383", "6303257879", "B0000039A6", "6303265693", "B009CSVQOU", "B00000JQTR", "6300147630", "6301574117", "0783235607", "6300214672", "6300213714", "6304370458", "630026999X", "6305363668", "6303257674", "6301427076", "6302798450", "6304910010", "6305814694", "6300262731", "0792835018", "6301024443", "0792110285", "6300268993", "6304508611", "B0000VCZMU", "6300182975", "6304113404", "1558807381", "6303920098", "6300182339", "B00000IQUT", "B00004RNAC", "6300185249", "6300987744", "0792845684", "6300183181", "B00000F0I2", "6302797632", "0792846303", "0792839242", "B0009A2PQI", "6300181642", "0764006770", "0792836677", "B00004WLXE"], "also_viewed": ["6302921058", "6300214192", "6300214311", "B00023NRSM", "6300214605", "6300214656", "6301094352", "6301589025", "0780627032", "6304288433", "6300218058", "6300189015", "B00AZ7V0W0", "B0002JP572", "630428845X", "6305095566", "0792839234", "B00DEQQK8S", "0792836634", "6303824382", "0767817664", "B00078XGO2", "6300182878", "6303265693", "B000RIWAVW", "0792116887", "B000VKL6Z2", "6304508611", "B002YICNE2", "6301562925", "B00ETHN9L2", "B00AEFY22I", "0451150899", "6301792734", "B00GHH9IIA", "6304509154", "B000FS9FE4", "B00AQJ8MLY", "B005CM1IES", "6301794982", "6301708695", "6300267881", "B00008HCCJ", "6300181278", "6303422020", "6304983794", "0783235607", "6300214176", "6303579388", "6305399409", "B00005B6ND", "6304240562", "6302814359", "630274461X", "B00D7AM71A", "0792839242", "6301589955"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 232095}, "asin": "6300214087", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71PWYF6B3GL._SY300_.gif", "title": "Friday the 13th 1 [VHS]"}

{"description": "When Samuel (Lukas Haas), a young Amish boy traveling with his mother Rachel (Kelly McGillis), witnesses the murder of a police officer in a public restroom, he and his mother become the temporary wards of John Book (Harrison Ford), a detective who's been assigned to solve the crime. After suspect lineups and mug-shot books yield nothing, Samuel, in the most memorable scene of the film, recognizes the murderer as a narcotics agent whose picture he sees in the precinct. Once Book realizes that the police chief is in on it, too, he whisks Samuel and Rachel back home to Amish country, where he himself goes into hiding as a plain Amish man. The juxtaposition between the life of the Amish and the violence of inner-city police corruption work surprisingly well for the story, and Kelly McGillis as the falling in love widow gives an almost perfect performance. Directed by Peter Weir, the film is extremely successful in drawing the viewer into its world and, accordingly, is immensely entertaining. The only thing that mars its polish is the one-dimensional, almost cartoonish handling of the upper-echelon police corruption--a subtler, more realistic treatment of this aspect of the story would have rendered the film near perfect.--James McGrath", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792116887", "B000007OY0", "6304259131", "0800125762", "6302816629", "6302238331", "6302935148", "0792133153", "6303269834", "B00000JS61", "080018789X", "630442972X", "B000003KDG", "0790743213", "6302415853", "6304071876", "079284517X", "B00005PJ8I", "6303402348", "0790748169", "6303057225", "6303637574", "6301599896", "6303942830", "B0000068ZQ", "6303020089", "6300181340", "0783235607", "6303402070", "B00007E2F6", "0790734079", "6300182479", "B00000J2L7", "6301734734", "079212569X", "6301736362", "6302909023", "0800116917", "6305126062", "6302226899", "6303696813", "6300247112", "0783226152", "B00000F5PI", "6305426678", "B000006N70", "0800132009", "6303058981", "6305012792", "B003MG6FJY", "6301976924", "5559477621", "B00005A1VH", "0783231482", "6303451462", "B000063UUP", "0792107683", "0800123506", "6304458975", "6303109950", "0790733935", "6304214502", "0792838556"], "bought_together": ["0792116887", "6302816629"], "also_viewed": ["6302380588"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 257292}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6300214567", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41JAT9P45FL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Witness [VHS]"}

Crosby and Kaye are song-and-dance men who hook up, romantically and professionally, with a \"sister\" act (Clooney and Vera-Ellen) to put on a Big Show to benefit the struggling ski-resort lodge run by the beloved old retired general (Dean Jagger) of their WWII Army outfit.

{"description": "Billy Wilder's noir-comic classic about death and decay in Hollywood remains as pungent as ever in its power to provoke shock, laughter, and gasps of astonishment. Joe Gillis (William Holden), a broke and cynical young screenwriter, is attempting to ditch a pair of repo men late one afternoon when he pulls off L.A.'s storied Sunset Boulevard and into the driveway of a seedy mansion belonging to Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), a forgotten silent movie luminary whose brilliant acting career withered with the coming of talkies. The demented old movie queen lives in the past, assisted by her devoted (but intimidating) butler, Max (played by Erich von Stroheim, the legendary director ofGreedand Swanson's own lost epic,Queen Kelly). Norma dreams of making a comeback in a remake ofSalometo be directed by her old colleague Cecil B. DeMille (as himself), and Joe becomes her literary and romantic gigolo.Sunset Blvd.is one of those great movies that has become a part of popular culture (the line \"All right, Mr. DeMille, I'm ready for my close-up,\" has entered the language)--but it's no relic.

Determined to marry wealthy Walter Matthau, she lures him out of Yonkers and sets about wooing him.Don't worry about the lack of a solid story or Gene Kelly's pedestrian direction. Watch instead for the musical numbers and the lavish costumes.

{"description": "Imaginatively rendered but slightly chilly, this 1951 Disney adaptation of the Lewis Carroll classic is also appropriately surreal.

For a Disney film, however, it seems more the self-satisfied sum of its inventiveness than a truly engaging experience.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["6304401132", "155890641X", "0788812408", "0788802194", "0788812807", "6302526574", "078881172X", "6302642248", "0788806270", "6302178924", "6303314015", "6302320402", "6304500831", "6300274195", "6300275310", "6303983812", "6302961572", "6305229449", "B000035Z2S", "6304400551", "0788805843", "6305319138", "6304290888", "6302787068", "0788803743", "6304089767", "6303929338", "6304100507", "B00005JKDQ", "B0000AQZYM", "6302158095", "6305326940", "6304978286", "6300274608", "B00000ICHA", "6304400225", "6305940932", "B00004R99N", "6301390725", "6302426200", "B00003CXQX", "B00005T7H6", "6301991311", "B00003CXHR", "B00003CX7L", "6303122647", "0788805533", "0788812440", "B00005RDVV", "1558906150", "6304089201", "6303036813", "B00000JS61", "6303534422", "6304501153", "6304155972", "B00005JKX3", "B0000524CZ", "0788811002", "B00016JF2W", "B0000E32WB", "1558901892", "B00000J2JA", "6304400381", "B00005JL95", "6304873441", "0788810634", "B0009SUS4Q", "6302484359", "078880720X", "6300276554", "B0002YLCHE", "0788810448", "B00007AJLB", "B00004R996", "B000063V8N", "0788812181", "B00008Y47S", "6304492952", "B00000ICHI", "6303295614", "6304089627", "B00004R99I", "6304492960", "6303439357", "B000035Z46", "B0001I55VK", "6302313937", "6303939015", "B00029LO18", "B00004REYY", "B00003CXXI", "0788809806", "B00005K9OA", "B00008DP4A", "6305942285", "6301106539", "6304401736", "6305177473"], "bought_together": ["6304401132", "0788812408"], "also_viewed": ["0788802194", "0788812408", "6303314015", "6304401132", "6302642248", "6302526574", "6304500831", "0788806270", "155890641X", "6302787068", "6302320402", "6302178924", "6304400551", "078881172X", "6300274195", "B000035Z2S", "6303983812", "6304290888", "6300275310", "0788805843", "0788812807", "6305319138", "6303534422", "B0000AQZYM", "6302961572", "6305229449", "6303929338", "6304089767", "6305940932", "6304978286", "6304100507", "0788805533", "B00005JKDQ", "6302426200", "6305326940", "B00004R99N", "B00003CXHR", "6300274608", "6304400225", "B00005RDVV", "B00003CX7L", "6304089201", "B0007KTBIU", "6302158095", "6301991311", "B00005JL95", "B00003CXQX", "6304501153", "0788812440", "B00004R99I", "B00000ICHA", "6304400381", "1558906150", "0788811002", "6304117752", "6301390725", "B00003CXXI", "B00000JS61"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 113227}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.43, "brand": "Disney", "asin": "6300274268", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51yPdnVWYXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Alice in Wonderland (Walt Disney Masterpiece Collection) [VHS]"}

He's a slick, seductive role model for the young ambitious Wall Street broker played by Charlie Sheen, who falls into Gecko's sphere of influence and instantly succumbs to the allure of risky deals and generous payoffs. With such perks as a high-rise apartment and women who love men for their money, Charlie's like a worm on Gecko's hook, blind to the corporate maneuvering that puts him at odds with his own father (played by Sheen's offscreen father, Martin).

Where the team strikes out, unfortunately, is in their concession to marquee politics, handing the pivotal role of Joe Hardy to handsome, vapid, celluloid heartthrob Tab Hunter, whose thin voice and unsteady screen presence argue that he should have stayed in the dugout.Walston is reliably spry and acerbic as the canny archangel, and Verdon, in one of her rare starring screen turns, confirms the comedic timing and sexy, muscular grace that made her a deserved draw in subsequent stage hits including another Fosse triumph,Sweet Charity.

{"description": "ThinkA Summer Place, and you'll probably be humming Max Steiner's wonderfully romantic instrumental theme song, a hand-holding hit in 1959. The movie itself is similarly irresistible, a colorful soap opera about the passions of a pair of dewy-eyed teens and their straying parents. At an island resort in Maine, Sandra Dee and Troy Donahue (the reigning teen idols of the day) fall hard for each other. What they don't know is that her father (Richard Egan) and his mother (Dorothy McGuire), lovers 20 years earlier, have rekindled their affair.

{"description": "The third collaboration between Stanley Donen and Gene Kelly,It's Always Fair Weatherfalls short of the classicsOn the TownandSingin' in the Rain, mostly due to a slow plot and middling songs by Andre Previn, Betty Comden, and Adolph Green. In a story reminiscent ofOn the Town, Kelly, Dan Dailey, and Michael Kidd play three GIs who return from the war vowing to stay buddies forever. When they reunite 10 years later, however, they find they have little in common, other than having given up on their dreams. Best known as the choreographer of such MGM evergreens asSeven Brides for Seven Brothers, the diminutive Kidd proves adept at kicking up his heels in front of the camera. Cyd Charisse plays a scheming television producer (an unusually down-home character) and Delores Gray is the toothy TV show host. (Gray gets to sing and Charisse dances a little, though not with Kelly.) The best moments, of course, are the dance numbers Kelly choreographed, including the three GIs' trash-can-lid dance, Charisse's solo supported by a crew of boxers, and Kelly's number on roller skates, \"I Like Myself,\" which combines some of the free spirit of \"Singin' in the Rain\" with the stunt footwear made famous by Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers in 1937'sShall We Dance. Unfortunately, the pan-and-scan format spoils the film's wide CinemaScope presentation, often fitting only two of the three characters on the screen.

John Huston's clean, black-comic adaptation of the Tennessee Williams play is a forceful snapshot of a man down to his last chance, and the superb black-and-white location photography by Gabriel Figueroa captures the end-of-the-world vibe. The women who tempt and taunt the reverend are Ava Gardner (with her maraca-shaking beach boys), Deborah Kerr, and Sue Lyon.

{"description": "The Russian answer to2001, and very nearly as memorable a movie. The legendary Russian director Andrei Tarkovsky made this extremely deliberate science-fiction epic, an adaptation of a novel by Stanislaw Lem. The story follows a cosmonaut (Donatas Banionis) on an eerie trip to a planet where haunting memories can take physical form. Its bare outline makes it sound like a routine space-flight picture, an elongatedTwilight Zoneepisode; but the further into its mysteries we travel, the less familiar anything seems. Even though Tarkovsky's meanings and methods are sometimes mystifying,Solarishas a way of crawling inside your head, especially given the slow pace and general lack of forward momentum. By the time the final images cross the screen, Tarkovsky has gone way beyond SF conventions into a moving, unsettling vision of memory and home.

{"description": "The wonderful Leslie Caron stars in this Oscar-winning musical fable with a touch of the bizarre. Caron plays Lili, a recently orphaned waif hopelessly in love with a carnival magician. Mel Ferrer plays Paul, a gruff puppeteer who can express his softer side only through his puppets. Sound weird? It is. Caron's performance is lovely. She is, as always, a graceful dancer, but she is also able to pull off the much more difficult task of making Lili pure and innocent without being icky--she  talks to Paul's puppets with complete conviction. (The puppets, by the way, are incredibly creepy.) Younger viewers will takeLiliat face value, but adults may well get sucked into its unintentional dark side: homelessness, suicide, emotional repression, and giant dancing puppets all come into play. Also enjoyable is Zsa Zsa Gabor, who does a great job standing around looking pretty as the magician's assistant.--Ali  Davis", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0045HCJJY", "B00004RERO", "6302806348", "6303562248", "B003156IHK", "6303120504"], "bought_together": ["B0045HCJJY", "B002HK9IDQ"], "also_viewed": ["B0045HCJJY", "B000HT3PGU", "B001675YPW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 216992}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 24.95, "brand": "MGM", "asin": "6302148332", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Y1MQB67ZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Lili [VHS]"}

{"description": "Perhaps ifThe Bishop's Wifehad lapsed on its copyright and fallen into the public domain likeIt's a Wonderful Life, it would be as much a Christmas staple as that classic. It certainly deserves to be. Dudley (Cary Grant) is an angel sent down by the prayers of a new bishop (David Niven). The bishop is trying to build a new cathedral, and he's so entrenched in his fundraising that he's watching his own marriage crumble around him. Loretta Young is devoted, moist-eyed, and basically a great date for the tempted Dudley. They drink in the afternoon, go skating at night, and make impulse buys.

Kasdan, very understandably, is attempting to create an experience for viewers as intuitive as the undefined forces propelling his characters.

{"description": "This documentary of the Rolling Stones' 1969 US tour has become a legendary, harrowing symbol of the tragic demise of the \"Peace and Love\" era. After a successful tour across the United States, the Rolling Stones gave a free December concert at Altamont Speedway in California with the Grateful Dead (not seen performing), Ike and Tina Turner, Jefferson Airplane, and the Flying Burrito Brothers (all seen performing one song each). The poorly planned show was fraught with problems from its inception. The band unwisely selected the Hells Angels motorcycle club to provide security, and after the pre-existing chaos was fueled by very visible alcohol and drug abuse, the bikers resorted to violence to keep the stoned, restless, and often naked crowd in line. The result: dozens of injuries and the on-screen stabbing of a young African-American man (during \"Sympathy for the Devil,\" no less) by one of the concert's \"staff security.\" In a manipulative but effective move, the Maysles brothers and Charlotte Zwerin filmed Mick Jagger in the editing room witnessing the on-camera murder for the first time. But aside from that unexpected drama, the film also works as a rock-and-roll document, capturing the band at their most relaxed, intoxicating, and electrifying.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001NXDSLQ", "6301095294"]}, "price": 27.98, "categories": [["CDs & Vinyl", "Classic Rock", "Album-Oriented Rock (AOR)"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Metal"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Rock", "Blues Rock"], ["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 311795}, "asin": "6302415993", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21S9HY0GRFL.jpg", "title": "The Rolling Stones - Gimme Shelter [VHS]"}
{"description": "Star Trek Vleft us nowhere to go but up, and with the return ofStar Trek IIdirector Nicholas Meyer,Star Trek VIrestored the movie series to its classic blend of space opera, intelligent plotting, and engaging interaction of stalwart heroes and menacing villains. Borrowing its subtitle (and several lines of dialogue) from Shakespeare, the movie finds Admiral Kirk (William Shatner) and his fellowEnterprisecrew members on a diplomatic mission to negotiate peace with the revered Klingon Chancellor Gorkon (David Warner). When the high-ranking Klingon and several officers are ruthlessly murdered, blame is placed on Kirk, whose subsequent investigation uncovers an assassination plot masterminded by the nefarious Klingon General Chang (Christopher Plummer) in an effort to disrupt a historic peace summit. As this political plot unfolds,Star Trek VItakes on a sharp-edged tone, with Kirk and Spock confronting their opposing views of diplomacy, and testing their bonds of loyalty when a Vulcan officer is revealed to be a traitor. With a dramatic depth befitting what was to be the final movie mission of the originalStar Trekcrew, this film took the veteran cast out in respectably high style.

{"description": "The British superspy with a license to kill takes on his dark underworld double, a classy assassin who kills with golden bullets at $1 million a hit. Roger Moore, in his second outing as James Bond, meets Christopher Lee's Scaramanga, one of the most magnetic villains in the entire series, in this entertaining but rather wan entry in the 007 sweepstakes. Bond's globetrotting search takes him to Hong Kong, Bangkok, and finally China, where Scaramanga turns his island retreat into a twisted theme park for a deadly game of wits between the gunmen, moderated by Scaramanga's diminutive man Friday Nick Nack (Fantasy Island's Herv&eacute; Villechaize). Britt Ekland does her best as the most embarrassingly inept Bond girl in 007 history, a clumsy, dim agent named Mary Goodnight who looks fetching in a bikini, while Maud Adams is Scaramanga's tough but haunted lover and assistant (she returns to the series as the title character inOctopussy). Clifton James, the redneck sheriff fromLive and Let Die, makes an embarrassing and ill-advised appearance as a racist tourist who briefly teams up with 007 in what is otherwise the film's highlight, a high-energy chase through the crowded streets of Bangkok that climaxes with a breathtaking midair corkscrew jump. Bond and company are let down by a lazy script, but Moore balances the overplayed humor with a steely performance and Lee's charm and enthusiasm makes Scaramanga a cool, deadly, and thoroughly enchanting adversary.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302510023", "6302510031", "630251018X", "630251004X", "6302510007", "6302380596", "6304047843", "6302510198", "630238060X", "6302380294", "B0000068SI", "B00008V2VP", "6304032579", "6302380588", "B000006FNX", "B00004TYS8", "6303651461", "6303651488", "6305784906", "B00004RWUH", "6302824613", "6303212263", "630596260X"], "bought_together": ["6302510023", "6302510031"], "also_viewed": ["6302380588", "6302510031", "6302510007", "6302510023", "B00004TYS8", "6302380294", "6304047843", "630251018X", "630251004X", "6303651488", "630238060X", "6303651461", "6302380596", "6302510198", "B00008V2VP", "6304032579"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 170742}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.58, "brand": "", "asin": "6302510015", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510E8WWVDZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Man With the Golden Gun [VHS]"}

{"description": "One of Humphrey Bogart's finest performances dominates this unusual 1950 film noir, which focuses less on the murder mystery at the center of its plot than on the investigation's devastating effect on a fragile romance. For Bogart, already a noir icon, the Andrew Solt script afforded an opportunity to explore a more complex and contradictory role--an antiheroic persona in line with the actor's most accomplished and absorbing triumphs throughout his career.For maverick director Nicholas Ray, the film posed the challenge of taking crime dramas beyond their usual formulas and into a more mature realm, as well as a chance to cast a jaundiced eye on the film industry itself. Its protagonist is Dixon Steele, a Hollywood screenwriter with an acerbic wit and a violent temper. Tasked with adapting a bestseller, he meets a hatcheck girl who's read the book, hoping to glean its highlights before writing the script. When she's found murdered, Steele becomes the prime suspect, and a tightening knot of suspicion forms around the writer.Steele's only, inconclusive witness is a pretty new neighbor, Laurel (Gloria Grahame), and the couple fall in love even as the pressure mounts. At first the new relationship is a tonic to the hard-boiled writer, who plunges into his script with a renewed vigor and discipline. But as the police continue to shadow him, Steele's own penchant for violence erupts against friends, strangers, and even Laurel herself, whose feelings are increasingly eclipsed by suspicion that her lover is a murderer, and fear that he'll harm her.Bogart conveys Steele's world-weariness and underlying vulnerability, and manages the delicate task of making both his romantic yearning and sudden, murderous rages equally convincing. Ultimately, that performance and Grahame's sympathetic work elevateIn a Lonely Placeinto what has been called \"an existential love story\" more than a crime drama.--Sam Sutherland", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000068EE", "6304056869", "6302413435", "B000BWIZRW", "6301978110", "0790743159", "6303364772", "B0007ZEO8C", "6302375827", "6302226899", "6304039522", "6304212151", "1558807780", "B001BZQMFA", "6302120446", "6301968948", "6304212135", "079074886X", "0783217528", "0790746387", "6300208249", "6302952581", "6301491920", "6301564456", "6302797675", "0790743531", "6301966430", "0783217390", "6302700949", "B00000493Q", "6300183912", "6302305942", "6301005740", "6301640667", "6302753198", "0783236352", "630292300X", "6302305950", "6302281849", "630150528X", "6303120474", "6303128890", "630196697X", "0792837096", "6302800897", "6302797519", "6304119038"], "bought_together": ["B000BWIZRW"]}, "price": 14.9, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 298317}, "asin": "6302801133", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510CFAB9KDL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "In a Lonely Place [VHS]"}
{"description": "This sequel to the Oscar-winning horror film based on the novel by William Peter Blatty was virtually laughed off the screen when it came out in 1977. It was an unintentionally hilarious mishmash and received such terrible reviews that director John Boorman yanked it out of theaters. He reedited it, cutting eight minutes in hopes of getting the story (written by William Goodhart) to the point of coherency, to no avail. The film remains a kind of reverse gold standard for sequels. It's still a ridiculously overacted, although at times visually haunting, movie. Richard Burton stars as a troubled priest (something of a specialty of his) who is brought in to follow up on the case of Linda Blair, who is institutionalized, still troubled by her encounter with the devil (who wouldn't be?).

{"description": "A champion of illumination and experimental shading, Kurosawa brings his unerring eye for indelible images to Shakespeare in this 1957 adaptation ofMacbeth. By changing the locale from Birnam Wood to 16th-century Japan, Kurosawa makes an oddball argument for the trans-historicity of Shakespeare's narrative; and indeed, stripped to the bare mechanics of the plot, the tale of cutthroat ambition rewarded (and thwarted) feels infinitely adaptable. What's lost in the translation, of course, is the force and beauty of the language--much of the script ofThrone of Bloodis maddeningly repetitive or superfluous--but striking visual images (including the surreal Cobweb Forest and some extremely artful gore) replace the sublime poetry. Toshiro Mifune is theatrically intense as Washizu, the samurai fated to betray his friend and master in exchange for the prestige of nobility; he portrays the ill-fated warrior with a passion bordering on violence, and a barely concealed conviviality. Somewhat less successful is Isuzu Yamada as Washizu's scheming wife; her poise and creepy impassivity, chilling at first, soon grows tedious. Kurosawa himself is the star of the show, though, and his masterful use of black-and-white contrast-- not to mention his steady, dramatic hand with a battle scene--keeps the proceedings thrilling. A must-see for fans of Japanese cinema, as well as all you devotees of samurai weapons and armor.--Miles Bethany", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302969697", "0780018702", "6303202055", "630296931X"], "also_viewed": ["6303202055", "6302919649", "0780021185", "1572522089"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 431622}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.94, "brand": "", "asin": "6302891272", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5196QE0Y8NL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Throne of Blood [VHS]"}

{"description": "Consistently cited by critics worldwide as one of the greatest films ever made, Jean Renoir's bittersweet drama of life, love, class, and the social code of manners and behavior (\"the rules of the game\") is a savage critique undertaken with sensitivity and compassion. Renoir's catch-phrase through the film, \"Everyone has their reasons,\" develops a multilayered meaning by the conclusion. A young aviator (Roland Toutain) commits a serious social faux pas by alluding to an affair on national radio. To avert a scandal, the cultured Robert de la Chesnaye (Marcel Dalio), husband to the aviator's mistress, Christine (Nora Gregor), and a philanderer in his own right, invites all to a weekend hunting party in his country mansion. The complicated maze of marriages and mistresses (social register and servant class alike) is plotted like a bedroom farce, but the tone soon takes a darker cast. Renoir, who also takes the pivotal role as Andre's jovial pal and de la Chesnaye confidant Octave, deftly blends high comedy with cutting satire as he parallels the upstairs-downstairs affairs. The film builds to a comic pitch with the hilarious performance of Julien Carette as a rabbit poacher turned groundskeeper, but soon turns tragic in a devastating conclusion. The film was roundly condemned and banned in France upon its 1939 release, but years later (out of the shadow of WWII) the film was rediscovered for the masterpiece that it is.--Sean Axmaker", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 412283}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "title": "The Rules of the Game [VHS]", "related": {"also_bought": ["6304628188"]}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51JT64E0AAL._SY300_.jpg", "asin": "6302969301"}

{"description": "Martin Scorsese does not sound like the logical choice to direct an adaptation of Edith Wharton's novel about manners and morals in New York society in the 1870s. But these are mean streets, too, and the psychological violence inflicted between characters is at least as damaging as the physical violence perpetrated by Scorsese's usual gangsters. At the center of the tale is Newland Archer (Daniel Day-Lewis), a somewhat diffident young man engaged to marry the very respectable May Welland (Winona Ryder). But Archer is distracted by May's cousin, the Countess Olenska (a radiant Michelle Pfeiffer), recently returned from Europe. As a married woman seeking a divorce, the countess is an embarrassment to all of New York society. But Archer is fascinated by her quick intelligence and worldly ways. Scorsese closely observes the tiny details of this world and this impossible situation; this is a movie in which the shift of someone's eyes can be as significant as the firing of a gun. The director's sense of color has never been keener, and his work with the actors is subtle.

The situation grows even more complicated when the couple's smart-aleck son comes home from military school, but it's not the plot here that's a top priority. Instead it's the sheer pleasure of witnessing a three-way verbal jousting match, written with razor-sharp skill and delivered by actors who are perfect for their roles. The movie's got a dark edge, but it never gets too dark--you know that it's not going to slide into more seriously damaging territory, so you can sit back and enjoy the volleys of scathing insults and sarcasm the way you would a Don Rickles performance. If that sounds like your idea of entertainment,The Refwill serve it up with style.--Jeff Shannon", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 416834}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.98, "brand": "", "asin": "6303153348", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51G9YC1ZAAL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Ref [VHS]"}

{"description": "James Bridges (Urban Cowboy,Bright Lights, Big City) directed this 1979 film that became a worldwide sensation when, just weeks after its release, the Three Mile Island nuclear accident occurred. Jane Fonda (Klute,Julia) plays a television news reporter who is not taken very seriously until a routine story at the local nuclear power plant leads her to what may be a cover-up of epic proportions. She and her cameraman, played by Michael Douglas (Wall Street,American President), hook up with a whistleblower at the plant, played by Jack Lemmon (Save the Tiger,Missing). Together they try to uncover the dangers lurking beneath the nuclear reactor and avoid being silenced by the business interests behind the plant. Though topical, the film (produced by Douglas) works on its own as a socially conscious thriller that entertains even as it spurs its audience to think.--Robert Lane", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004IFIMT4"], "bought_together": ["B004IFIMT4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 376859}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.8, "brand": "", "asin": "6303257216", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/512QCWVYBKL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "China Syndrome [VHS]"}

{"description": "Based on an obscure crime novel titledTucker's People, Abraham Polonsky'sForce of Evilhas attained classic status since its release in 1948, when film noir was thriving on the fringes of the Hollywood studio system, where the shadowy attributes of noir were allowed their fullest expression. Which is to say, this gritty drama is drenched in greed, cynicism, and corruption of the soul, as embodied by John Garfield in one of his most memorable roles. He's perfectly cast as Joe Morse, a lawyer whose connection to a ruthless racketeer has nearly destroyed his sense of morality. His participation in a rigged numbers racket could prove disastrous for his high-strung older brother (superbly played by Thomas Gomez), whose small-time policy bank stands to go broke when the rigged numbers pay off--a financial windfall for Joe's powerful boss at everyone else's expense.Joe's corruption is tempered only by remnants of guilt and his redeeming attraction to Edna (Marie Windsor), his brother's secretary, whose common decency gnaws at Joe's rotten conscience. But before Joe can rise from his self-made hell,Force of Eviltakes him to the darkest pit of tragic humanity--a downward spiral perfectly expressed through George Barnes's exquisitely stark cinematography. In style and substance, this is quintessential noir, its plot unfolding with uncompromising toughness and intelligence. More's the pity, then, that director Polonsky was later victimized by the Hollywood blacklist, curtailing a promising career for two decades until Polonsky directed Robert Redford in 1969'sTell Them Willie Boy Is Here. It seems only fitting, then, that Polonsky's remarkable debut is now recognized as one of the finest dramas of its kind.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000PKG7CU", "B0000UX4V2", "0783217390", "0790743531", "0783217528", "0792844564", "6301491920"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 434889}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6303391923", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71FQ9D7V3EL._SY300_.gif", "title": "Force of Evil [VHS]"}

{"description": "Proof, a brilliant allegory about trust, is at once mordantly  funny, chilling, and touching. It keeps us off balance from the beginning, challenging our assumptions about everything from the art of filmmaking to the nature of human relationships. The tone is reminiscent of David Mamet and Harold Pinter, but Australian writer-director Jocelyn Moorhouse has a quirky outlook all her own. Hugo Weaving (later known as the villainous Agent Smith inThe Matrix), plays Martin, a blind  photographer who compulsively shoots photos as proof of the actuality of his  existence. He relies on his spiteful housekeeper, Celia (Genevi&egrave;ve  Picot), to tell him what's in his snapshots. But can he trust her to tell him  the truth? Celia rearranges the furniture so Martin will trip over it. Why?  Because she's in love with him. But Martin won't let her into his heart; he's  never been able to trust anyone. Into this quagmire of mutual torment walks  Andrew, a regular guy personified, to become the first real friend Martin has  ever had. At this point the picture jumps up a notch, for Andrew is played by  hunky, appealing young Russell Crowe, whose emotional range and star quality are already unmistakable. Just when we think thatProofhas devolved into yet another feel-good buddy picture, the ground shifts again beneath our feet.

Kirk and his contemporaries would have to be very, very old, or there would be some time travel involved in the plot. Since geriatric heroes aren't very exciting (despite a welcomed cameo appearance by the aged Dr. McCoy),Star Trek: Generationsunites Capt. Kirk (William Shatner) and Capt. Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) in a time-jumping race to stop a madman's quest for heavenly contentment. When a mysterious energy coil called the Nexus nearly destroys the newly christened U.S.S.Enterprise-B, the just-retired Capt. Kirk is lost and presumed dead. But he's actually been happily trapped in the timeless purgatory of the Nexus--an idyllic state of being described by the mystical Guinan (Whoopi Goldberg) as \"pure joy.\" Picard must convince Kirk to leave this artificial comfort zone and confront Dr. Soran (Malcolm McDowell), the madman who will threaten billions of lives to be reunited with the addictive pleasure of the Nexus. With subplots involving the android Data's unpredictable \"emotion chip\" and the spectacular crash-landing of the starshipEnterprise, this crossover movie not only satisfiedTrekfans, but it also gave them something they'd never had to confront before: the heroic and truly final death of a belovedStar Trekcharacter.

Derek Jacobi plays Roman Emperor Claudius, who reflects in old age on his life and his remarkable family, giving us a history lesson that's unlike anything you learned in school.The story begins in 24&nbsp;B.C. during the reign of Augustus Caesar, Rome's  first emperor, and ends in A.D.&nbsp;54 with Nero on the throne. In between,I, Claudiusdetails the scheming, murder, madness, and lust that passed for politics in the early years of the Pax Romana. The biggest worm in the Roman apple is Augustus's wife, Livia (the superb Si&acirc;n Phillips), whose single-minded pursuit of power shapes the destiny of the Empire. With a carefully planted rumor here and a poisoned fig there, she gradually maneuvers her son, Tiberius, toward the throne, creating an atmosphere of suspicion and treachery that starts Rome on its helter-skelter slide into bloody chaos. Phillips somehow makes us understand this extraordinarily wicked woman. As she ages and her carefully wrought webs begin to unravel, it becomes clear that Livia has been as thoroughly poisoned by her own ambition as her victims were by her carefully prepared meals.Further acting honors go to George Baker as Tiberius, who resists but eventually succumbs to the destiny forced upon him by his mother, and to John Hurt as a hilarious and absolutely terrifying Caligula. In one breathtakingly tense scene, the mad Emperor performs a dance in drag, then asks Claudius to critique it, perfectly capturing the horror of a world where one wrong word means death, or worse. Jacobi is the perfect Claudius, hiding his intelligence behind a crippling stammer and shuffling around the edges of events--until he finds himself pulled to the very center. His wry comments give shape to the tangled story of his family and help the audience make sense of a dauntingly complex cast of characters.I, Claudiusmight seem a little studio-bound to viewers brought up on more recent big-budget costume dramas, but the topnotch cast and the incident-filled plot are more than enough to hold the attention through almost 11&nbsp;hours of gripping, deliciously wicked Roman follies. This boxed set also includes a documentary entitled \"The Epic That Never Was,\" about Alexander Korda's failed attempt to filmI, Claudiusin 1937. The film, directed by Josef von Sternberg and starring Charles Laughton as Claudius and Merle Oberon as Messalina, was abandoned unfinished, and it remains one of Hollywood's great lost movies.--Simon Leake", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302676185", "630354231X", "6302075270"], "also_viewed": ["B006JY3OHW", "6302075270"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 306411}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 19.93, "brand": "", "asin": "6303980813", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51AV6N7YYFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "I, Claudius [VHS]"}

In 1900,  Henri Fortin (Belmondo) is wrongfully imprisoned for murder; his loyal wife is  forced into menial labor and prostitution; then in the beginning of World War  II, Fortin's son (Belmondo again) helps a Jewish family elude the Nazis, setting  in motion his own imprisonment, escape, and adventures as a criminal. Not only  is that just the first half of the movie, there are also the story lines of the  husband, wife, and daughter of the Jewish family, who each have their own  struggles.

This time, we follow the fortunes of four people who lock themselves inside a shopping mall to get away from the marauding dead and who then immerse themselves in unabashed consumerism, taking what they want from an array of clothing and jewelry shops, making gourmet meals, etc. It is Romero's take on Louis XVI in the modern world: keep the starving masses at bay and crank up the insulated indulgence.

{"description": "MGM originally promotedDinner at Eightby touting the \"all-star cast,\" but this is no run-of-the-mill omnibus picture. On the contrary, rather than cramming as many big names as possible into a lumbering vehicle, the movie's impeccably crafted script (by Edna Ferber and Herman J. Mankiewicz) and direction (by George Cukor) gave some immortal screen luminaries a chance to shine. For sheer bravery, John Barrymore's achingly poignant performance as Larry Renault, a washed-up matinee idol who has \"outlived everything but his vanity,\" is unmatched. Barrymore's brother, Lionel, is equally touching as shipping magnate Oliver Jordan. Oliver vainly tries to save his family's century-old firm, at the same time hiding his financial and health troubles from his wife, Millicent, played to hysterical perfection by Billie Burke. The Great Depression is presented in microcosm as Millicent frets about throwing the ultimate society dinner, oblivious to the world tumbling down around her. She is forced to invite to her precious party such undesirables as crass financier Dan Packard (\"HesmellsOklahoma!\"). Even worse in Millicent's eyes than Packard (Wallace Beery, doing an impressive steamroller imitation) is his social-climbing wife, Kitty (Jean Harlow, never funnier than she is here, malingering in bed gobbling chocolates, or braying at her husband: \"I'm gonna be a lady if it kills me!\"). Be sure to watch for Harlow's brief encounter with Marie Dressler, who brings an extraordinary winking wisdom to the role of aging star Carlotta Vance. As the two enter the dining room in the film's final scene, Harlow makes an offhand remark that elicits from Dressler one of the great screen double takes of all time.

{"description": "After Martin Scorsese went to Hollywood in 1972 to direct the low-budgetBoxcar Berthafor B-movie mogul Roger Corman, the young director showed the film to maverick director John Cassavetes and got an instant earful of urgent advice. \"It's crap,\" said Cassavetes in no uncertain terms, \"now go out and make something that comes from your heart.\" Scorsese took the advice and focused his energy onMean Streets, a riveting contemporary film about low-life gangsters in New York's Little Italy that critic Pauline Kael would later call \"a true original, and a triumph of personal filmmaking.\" Starring Robert De Niro and Harvey Keitel in roles that announced their talent to the world, it set the stage for Scorsese's emergence as one of the greatest American filmmakers. Introducing themes and character types that Scorsese would return to inTaxi Driver,GoodFellas,Casino, and other films, the loosely structured story is drawn directly from Scorsese's background in the Italian neighborhoods of New York, and it seethes with the raw vitality of a filmmaker who has found his creative groove. As the irresponsible and reckless Johnny Boy, De Niro offers striking contrast to Keitel's Charlie, who struggles to reconcile gang life with Catholic guilt. More of an episodic portrait than a plot-driven crime story,Mean Streetsremains one of Scorsese's most direct and fascinating films--a masterful calling card for a director whose greatness was clearly apparent from that point forward.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0790733927", "6302842263", "630026887X", "B000005PPB", "6302816629", "6301564456"], "also_viewed": ["6302066891", "6303534368"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 426972}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6304457375", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51CA63GNNXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Mean Streets [VHS]"}

{"description": "Vittorio De Sica's remarkable 1947 drama of desperation and survival in Italy's devastating post-war depression earned a special Oscar for its affecting power. Shot in the streets and alleys of Rome, De Sica uses the real-life environment of contemporary life to frame his moving drama of a desperate father whose new job delivering cinema posters is threatened when a street thief steals his bicycle. Too poor to buy another, he and his son take to the streets in an impossible search for his bike. Cast with nonactors and filled with the real street life of Rome, this landmark film helped define the Italian neorealist approach with its mix of real life details, poetic imagery, and warm sentimentality. De Sica uses the wandering pair to witness the lives of everyday folks, but ultimately he paints a quiet, poignant portrait of father and son, played by nonprofessionals Lamberto Maggiorani and Enzo Staiola, whose understated performances carry the heart of the film. De Sica and scenarist Cesare Zavattini also collaborated onShoeshine,Miracle in Milan, andUmberto D, all classics in the neorealist vein, but none of which approach the simple poetry and quiet power achieved inThe Bicycle Thief.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["1572524448"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 492162}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 19.86, "brand": "", "asin": "6304963173", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/712GEZEYA3L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Bicycle Thief [VHS]"}

{"description": "Created bymangaartist Monkey Punch in 1967,Lupin IIIis a master thief, the direct descendant of Ars&#xE8;ne Lupin. His off-the-wall escapades spoof the adventures of James Bond and similar rakish heroes. The typically baroque plot of \"Mamo\" requires Lupin and his sidekicks, the super-samurai Goemon and the beatnik Jigan, to steal the ingredients needed for a compound that produces eternal youth. The mastermind behind this scheme is the mad billionaire-industrialist Hayward Lockwood, a.k.a. Mamo. Lupin's clumsy attempts to seduce Mamo's voluptuous red-haired agent, Fujiko, and his successful evasions of the obsessed Inspector Zenigata provide additional comedy. The features and TV programs in theLupin IIIseries are much cartoonier and slower paced than more recent anime comedy-adventures, although their influence onRanma 1/2and other Japanese tongue-in-cheek heroes is clear. The animation is sloppy, Lupin's features change from scene to scene, and his hands frequently look like scribbles.The Mystery of Mamois too silly to work as an adventure, but not silly enough to work as a farce, at least in this English version.--Charles Solomon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00HVFA2Z0", "B007HMCQBA", "B00CDV4JG0", "B00IZHPOGU", "B000V6LT7G", "B00BUAEZMS", "B0030Y120A", "B0009HLDFA", "B0006H326G", "B00006677F", "B00LMCDHMS", "B00LNBQ8UG", "B0008G2I6A", "B0002IQH8Y", "B00000JL3V", "B0001DCYPU", "B00020HBE6", "B000BSZAHE", "B000E6UJOM", "B00AIZ2LR2", "B0002JEM5I", "B0007LXONC", "B000CNGBTY", "B00006673B", "B00843TZEC", "B00006673C", "B0000BWVDS", "B00DELKA2U", "B0000633S8", "B00CU6WBOU", "B000AC7OSY", "B00IQAUO6Q", "B00CPTUNNI", "B00079I07Y", "B00IZHPOCE", "B00HFC547A", "B00ENO2QQ0", "B00005V4XG", "B00HFC30A8", "B00IQAUO2A", "B00HMOW9YM", "B008YRL7JE", "B00008DDG2", "B00IQAUO48", "B00KDP31US", "B008XEZXXE", "B007S9XXFA", "B00GY71GHE", "B00CSYRHG6", "B0001EFTVA", "1939130190", "B00IQAUO5C", "B000AARL2A", "B00KBD4SJA", "B00JV054BA", "B0062KMDWU", "B00HXEWGY4", "B0096W46VW", "B00008W2RK", "B00HXEWHM0", "B00CJ7Y19I", "B00HXEWGLW", "B00F9DQ73W", "B00HE01030", "B00F9F4DX6", "B005WMQ5R8", "B00DJ5IOM4", "B0007939U2", "B00G0OM3EG", "B00GSTHBS6", "B00II50JLE", "B00ITE4XUM", "B00I099JY6", "B00I3C1T7A", "B008NA3I76", "B00I462XLG", "B00CDV4NTS", "B000094J8X", "B00D44IQM8", "B00HFBZB9M", "B00I099JWI", "B00004YZGB", "B008NNY9HQ", "B000E6EK6K", "B00007JZW5", "B00E00GBYA", "1421550644", "B00DPH7SZA", "B00HXEWECI", "B00I3C1T6G", "1935654985", "B0049TC8C6", "1939130204", "B00CENSU3A", "B000FS2VYK", "B00I462XGG", "B000J3EAY0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00CDV4JG0", "B007HMCQBA", "B0030Y120A", "B0009HLDFA"]}, "price": 22.98, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 477520}, "asin": "6305090246", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51N9WF0EWHL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Lupin the 3rd - The Mystery of Mamo"}
{"description": "David O. Selznick wantedGone with the Windto be somehow more than a movie, a film that would broaden the very idea of what a film could be and do and look like. In many respects he got what he worked so hard to achieve in this 1939 epic (and all-time box-office champ in terms of tickets sold), and in some respects he fell far short of the goal. While the first half of this Civil War drama is taut and suspenseful and nostalgic, the second is ramshackle and arbitrary. But there's no question that the film is an enormous achievement in terms of its every resource--art direction, color, sound, cinematography--being pushed to new limits for the greater glory of telling an American story as fully as possible. Vivien Leigh is still magnificently narcissistic, Olivia de Havilland angelic and lovely, Leslie Howard reckless and aristocratic. As for Clark Gable: we're talking one of the most vital, masculine performances ever committed to film.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["6304117752", "0792839846", "6304178352", "630150528X", "6303215734", "B00000JS61", "0792151712", "0783222955", "0800116917", "6304151306", "630233683X", "6300183513", "0783221347", "6303494390", "B0000040EJ", "6302150620", "6300215814", "6301586026", "B00000F6D1", "6304274742", "6300215741", "0783235593", "B000056BRF", "6300215830", "6304400551", "6304239149", "6300185095", "6305282927", "0788806270", "6300207919", "6300213668", "6300181340", "6302610702", "5559477621", "6303854311", "B000059HH1", "6304039530", "0800100832", "B00004TYS8", "B00000JKNP", "B0000040EO", "6302936381", "6302227127", "6300215695", "6304039506", "6304994540", "6300277089", "6305576173", "630428635X", "6303020089", "B00005RRG3", "6301975987", "0783235607", "6301628454", "6300270971", "6303637574", "6300215628", "6304359705", "6304119046", "0792837207", "1558807780", "6300181987", "0783236352", "630251018X", "6302413435", "6303057225", "6301650514", "6304457316", "6300215512", "6301976061", "0800124693", "B000M7BEPQ", "B000005PPB", "630197350X", "6301976924", "0792837576", "B003UPPO2G", "6300267857", "B00005A1VG", "6301976983", "0790733897", "B00004RV8M", "6303651488", "6301969294", "6302241189", "6300246868", "B00000I1EM", "B0001E7LQG", "B00000F3QZ", "6303364772", "6303562248", "6304196954", "B00000FZCU", "6302640504", "6302360978", "0790733935", "6300181421", "6302484405", "6305718792"], "bought_together": ["6304117752", "6304178352"], "also_viewed": ["1451635621", "6304117752", "0792839846", "6304178352", "0800116917", "0792151712", "6304274742", "6304151306", "6303215734", "630233683X", "6304119046", "B00000JS61", "155890641X", "6305363668", "6304539258", "630018403X", "B002YZFBXA", "6302526574", "6300215598", "6300213668", "6301976983", "B0046ZE3LC", "6300215830", "0790743213", "6300182207", "6300181529", "B00000JGEI", "1558807780", "0792839129", "6304500831", "6304429274", "0784011923", "630150528X", "6304400225", "B00001IVED", "6300215717", "0788812408", "B00B7K0JZS", "0767825411", "B0000040EK", "B0000040EO", "0792158261", "B00008EYA5", "630141277X", "0800124693", "6302054982", "6303506291", "0783222955", "6300183211", "6300215814", "0790742322", "B00000JKNP", "B0000AM6IY", "B0000AQZYM", "0783216084", "6303402070", "6301797906", "630281622X", "6302961572"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 168297}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6305123616", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZGXJP009L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Gone With the Wind [VHS]"}
{"description": "There was some amazing, classic animation done for superhero cartoons  done as far back as Max & Dave Fleisher'sSupermanseries of the early 1940s (echoes of which can be found inBatman: The Animated Series). Those were done for the big screen; by the mid-1960s, superhero cartoons were being brought to television, and some of Marvel Comics' biggest heroes--Captain America, Spider-Man, Thor, and the Incredible Hulk--were the stars. Unfortunately, television didn't have much in terms of cachet--or production values--at the time, and all four heroes suffer for it.The Hulk gets short shrift here; the interesting thing about the character has always been twofold: the misunderstood misfit trying to make a quiet life for himself, and the Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde duality of the Hulk and his alter ego, Dr. Bruce Banner. On the two episodes here--\"The Power of Dr.&nbsp;Banner\" and \"The Origin of the Hulk\"--the animation is minimal and barely serves to capture a single facet of either character's personality. It looks as if only a couple dozen pictures of the main characters were drawn; for the most part, this is a series of stationary illustrations with voiceovers and plenty of narration.--Randy Silver", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005Y77V", "079394192X", "B00005Y78T", "6305251525", "B00021XV2Q", "0793941938", "6302161673", "6305251495", "B004I9SJSE"], "bought_together": ["B00005Y78T"], "also_viewed": ["B00005Y77V", "B004I9SJSE", "B000089G5S", "B001ECDVH2", "B00005Y78T", "B001DRF84W"]}, "price": 19.95, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 422291}, "asin": "6305251479", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61927ATYCQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Incredible Hulk - Origin of the Hulk / The Power of Doctor Banner [VHS]"}
{"description": "Francis Ford Coppola was working as an assistant to Roger Corman when he made this, his feature debut.  The story goes that Corman let Coppola make the film so long as he could work around the shooting schedule of the film they were working on together, and the results are impressive given the budget constraints. Or maybebecauseof the budget constraints.  The story concerns the family at Castle Haloran, the secrets surrounding the death of young Kathleen, and an axe murderer who seems to be picking away at all present.  Coppola's deft direction keeps this from being a routine ghost story, using light and dark in his compositions to create tension and suspense.  The film has an interesting way of spanning the traditional ghost story and the more modern gore-fests that we're used to.  I have one bone to pick with the manufacturer of this disc: the transfer to DVD was made from tape.  This is evident from the way the frames roll repeatedly during the last 15 minutes of the film, and the tape bunches a few times leaving video artifacts. DVD consumers want all the benefits of this medium, and not to have the degraded quality of tape preserved on it.  If this is the only way you can get this film, at least the price is reasonable. It's also packaged as aFright Night Horror Classicalong withNight of the Living DeadandRevolt of the Zombies.--Jim Gay", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0013D8LAE", "B000054OU5", "B000IMUYJM", "B007XF0W3K", "B00DZP1C9K", "B00009NHBC", "B005AMJ36U", "B0045HCJKS", "1559409002", "B00G5GNYY2", "B00003CXCF", "B00E5S2HGS", "0783116926", "B000C20VNM", "B0049CIURA", "B00008438U", "6305268800", "B00000ILEU", "B007UQ8IT2", "B000FFJZO2", "B00005AUK0", "B00000K3U3", "B00B2M7DKA", "B0007R4SZY", "B008BWFOXM", "B003XURDAY", "B000E991DE", "B002DU0RFS", "B00003XAMT", "B003Y7F1L4", "B00006ADD8"], "bought_together": ["B0013D8LAE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005BGRH", "B0002B55FC", "B00027JYNK", "B00C6F61HS"]}, "price": 8.03, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 566242}, "asin": "6305248125", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51J95QEMBML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Fright Night 2: Dementia 13"}
{"description": "Way back in 1976, actor-director Ron Howard made a bargain with shlockmeister producer-director Roger Corman. It went something like  this: Corman agreed to produce Howard's feature directorial debut, the 1977Grand Theft Auto, and Howard agreed to star in another of Corman's pieces  of drive-in fodder, the quirkyEat My Dust!Written and directed by  Charles B. Griffith (a favorite screenwriter of Corman's who penned the originalLittle Shop of Horrors, among many others),Eat My Dust!is as  wacked-out as anything to come out of the American International Pictures factory, and it is  still surprisingly fresh and funny. Howard plays Hoover Niebold, son of a  small-town, no-nonsense sheriff (Warren J. Kemmerling) and a prime candidate for dreary obscurity with his nowhere job and dull love life. Hoover takes  a risk and asks out a popular girl (Christopher Norris), but after she demands that he steal the car of a professional racer (Dave Madden), the young hero abandons his innocence for a wild ride. Griffith hammers on the chase action sequences, bolting a camera to the car's hood to instill maximum  vertigo in viewers, and constantly finding new and witty ways to jazz up scenes of speeding autos terrorizing the roads. But the real hook is the film's distinctive mix of youthful energy and comic irony, the latter  exploding in Griffith's gallery of rural half-wits and neurotic, middle-class stereotypes.

{"description": "Werner Herzog's remake of F.W. Murnau'soriginal vampire classicis at once a generous tribute to the great German director and a distinctly unique vision by one of cinema's most idiosyncratic filmmakers. Though Murnau'sNosferatuwas actually an unauthorized adaptation of Bram  Stoker'sDracula, Herzog based his film largely on Murnau's conceptions--at times directly quoting Murnau's images--but manages to slip in a few references to Tod Browning'sfamous version(at one point the vampire comments on the howling wolves: \"Listen, the children of the night make their music.\"). Longtime Herzog star Klaus Kinski is both hideous and melancholy as Nosferatu (renamed Count Dracula in the English language version). As in Murnau's film, he's a veritable gargoyle with his bald pate and sunken eyes, and his talon-like fingernails and two snaggly fangs give him a distinctly feral quality. But Kinski's haunting eyes also communicate a gloomy loneliness--the curse of his undead immortality--and his yearning for Lucy (Isabelle Adjani) becomes a melancholy desire for love. Bruno Ganz's sincere but foolish Jonathan is doomed to the vampire's will and his wife, Lucy, a holy innocent whose deathly pallor and nocturnal visions link her with the ghoulish Nosferatu, becomes the only hope against the monster's plague-like curse. Herzog's dreamy, delicate images and languid pacing create a stunningly beautiful film of otherworldly mood, a faithful reinterpretation that by the conclusion has been shaped into a quintessentially Herzog vision.--Sean Axmaker", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 272814}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "title": "Nosferatu the Vampyre [VHS]", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000056NW6", "6302783356", "B000VUQ4HW", "6304509154"], "also_viewed": ["6302194296", "B00EO2I6RO"]}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5123FXMFFAL._SY300_.jpg", "asin": "630526323X"}
{"description": "Jay Bulworth is your typical senator going through a nervous breakdown. The empty speeches, lies, money, and pressure have led him to plan his own assassination on a weekend trip home to California just before the election. However, a cord snaps in him and like Jim Carrey's rambling lawyer inLiar, Liar, Bulworth can only tell the truth. This new freedom turns Bulworth on and he spews the ugly truth about politics: he tells mass media they are as corrupt as insurance companies; lambastes a black church for not having leaders; and riles the Jewish power elite of Hollywood. He enters South Central running away from advisors (including a bemused Oliver Platt) and mixing it up with a potential new girlfriend (Halle Berry) and a local boss (Don Cheadle). He offends across  the board, even developing an inherent knack to rap his speeches. And the public loves it. The weekend becomes a clarifying point for Bulworth: he finds a reason to live.Beatty's rude and relevant comedy is a one-joke movie, but the joke is pretty good. It's a courageous film that is always sharp even though it loses narrative focus. Beatty's hilarious raps are so inspired they deserve repeated viewings. As usual, Beatty surrounds himself with a great crew, Ennio Morricone's music and Vittorio Storaro's cinematography being especially noteworthy. Beatty and Storaro even have the audacity to imitate two very famous photographs in the film's final seconds. The script by Beatty and Jeremy Pikser won the L.A.

{"description": "The beast inThe Flying Serpentis Quetzalcoatl, the feathered serpent god of  the Aztecs. Evil archaeologist George Zucco keeps this half-bird,  half-reptile creature caged in a secret chamber within some New Mexico ruins,  the better to guard a cache of Montezuma's hidden gold. The professor has  obviously cracked under the strain of his studies, leading his stepdaughter  to deliver the immortal line, \"I wish there was never any such thing as Aztec  Indians.\" (They probably feel the same way about you, honey.) The Q-monster's  killings are investigated by a radio sleuth, adding a weird wrinkle to the  scenario; important revelations in the story have a funny way of happening  while the sleuth's show is live on the air. Two reasons for seeing this  58-minute cheapie from rock-bottom PRC studio: George Zucco, the tireless, beetle-browed villain of countless '40s B&nbsp;movies (with the occasional  goodie, such as Moriarty inThe Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, thrown in),  and the campy Quetzalcoatl, a forerunner of Japanese horror-movie monsters. In this film, the Aztec deity generally resembles a poorly crafted pi&ntilde;ata  flung across a wire--he flaps his wings with that weird,  aerodynamically suspect motion familiar to Rodan-watchers. For more on the  adventures of Quetzalcoatl, see Larry Cohen's 1983 thrillerQ: The Winged Serpent, a nutty variation on the same creature.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00HFWETZ8", "B00D9EJFV4", "B00FMGPWNW", "B00D9EJFZA", "B0007R4T26", "B00007G1TI", "B00DOZNGC2", "B000EHSVJG", "B00005R1O7", "B000VX9WB4", "B000C20VNM", "B0047DKLBO", "B007HCI4SE", "B00B2M79XQ", "B005OT7XMU", "B009AGEWYA", "B00D3DJH7S", "B00BUWD7Q6", "B0000JD28S", "B001DM3QDM", "B00AOO5NW2", "B000787YRW", "B00B2TTVS0", "B00DE1LD6W", "B00AOO5QVK", "B000K0YM18", "B005E7SFH4", "B000BYA5I2", "B0079R1LNM", "B0000542CN", "B000RXVNCE", "B00AQMWEKG", "6305836833", "6305772711"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005OT7YX8", "B0007R4T26", "B0071EKJWM", "B00008973H"]}, "price": 9.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 252160}, "asin": "630547253X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/611R1F37K2L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Flying Serpent"}
{"description": "The French director Jacques Demy scored a worldwide hit in 1964 withThe Umbrellas of Cherbourg, a bittersweet candy-colored romance in which all the dialogue was set to music. Equally enchanting is the musical that reunited Demy with the star and composer ofUmbrellas, Catherine Deneuve and Michel Legrand. The film isThe Young Girls of Rochefort, an effervescent concoction about traveling players and dreamy-headeddemoisellesin a seaside town. Deneuve and her real-life sister, Fran&#xE7;oise Dorl&#xE9;ac (who died in a car accident not long after the movie was made), play twins who fantasize about life in Paris. But before they leave town, they are distracted by the weekend fair and its colorful singers and dancers. They're also destined to meet an American composer--gloriously, it's Gene Kelly, carrying the aura of classic MGM musicals in his lighter-than-air wake. He was 55 at the time, but much younger in movie years. (Another American, George Chakiris, also dances his way through the film.) Legrand's music isn't as powerful as hisCherbourgscore, and some of the choreography would fit right into anAustin Powersdiscotheque sequence. And the costumes--well, the excesses of '60s mod designs have not aged well. Yet the crazy hairstyles and vinyl boots fit right into the film's sense of gleeful fun. There is a sunny, daffy spirit to this movie that becomes positively infectious. It deserves to be better known. (Try to catch a widescreen version, if possible.)--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0001BMLUA", "B003SEH3EQ", "1572520922"], "bought_together": ["B0001BMLUA", "B003SEH3EQ"]}, "price": 7.5, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 289870}, "asin": "6305674051", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HN758B8RL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Young Girls of Rochefort [VHS]"}

{"description": "Noted for intimate character studies created in collaboration with his actors, director Mike Leigh makes a dramatic change of pace with this biography of comic opera composers W.S. Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan. Gilbert (Jim Broadbent) is an easily angered but otherwise emotionally remote lyricist who works in collaboration with composer Sullivan (Alan Corduner), a genial and fun-loving sort who feels unsatisfied writing light operettas and longs to work with more serious material. While Sullivan is having a creative crisis, Gilbert is facing a failing marriage to Lucy (Lesley Manville), who loves her husband even if he can't return her affections, and must deal with his ailing father (Charles Simon). When they suffer their first failure, both men are depressed, and Sullivan announces that he's giving up operetta for good. However, a visit to an exhibit of Japanese art sparks an idea in Gilbert, and soon he and Sullivan are hard at work on what will become one of their greatest successes, The Mikado. Much of the film is devoted to the staging of this classic, with Shirley Henderson, Dorothy Atkinson, Martin Savage, Timothy Spall, and Kevin McKidd as members of the operetta's cast. Jim Broadbent won Best Actor at the 1999 Venice Film Festival. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi\n\nR, 2 hr. 40 min.\nDrama, Musical & Performing Arts, Art House & International, Comedy\nDirected By: Mike Leigh\nWritten By: Mike Leigh\nIn Theaters: Dec 17, 1999 Limited", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 373514}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.41, "brand": "", "asin": "6305882010", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Q6RXY94VL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Topsy Turvy [VHS]"}

{"description": "Pixar genius reigns in this funny romantic comedy, which stars a robot who says absolutely nothing for a full 25 minutes yet somehow completely transfixes and endears himself to the audience within the first few minutes of the film. As the last robot left on earth, Wall-E (voiced by Ben Burtt) is one small robot--with a big, big heart--who holds the future of earth and mankind squarely in the palm of his metal hand. He's outlasted all the \"Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class\" robots that were assigned some 700 years ago to clean up the environmental mess that man made of earth while man vacationed aboard the luxury spaceship Axiom. Wall-E has dutifully gone about his job compacting trash, the extreme solitude broken only by his pet cockroach, but he's developed some oddly human habits and ideas. When the Axiom sends its regularly scheduled robotic EVE probe (Elissa Knight) to earth, Wall-E is instantly smitten and proceeds to try to impress EVE with his collection of human memorabilia. EVE's directive compels her to bring Wall-E's newly collected plant sprout to the captain of the Axiom and Wall-E follows in hot pursuit. Suddenly, the human world is turned upside down and the Captain (Jeff Garlin) joins forces with Wall-E and a cast of other misfit robots to lead the now lethargic people back home to earth. Wall-E is a great family film with the most impressive aspect being the depth of emotion conveyed by a simple robot--a machine typically considered devoid of emotion, but made so absolutely touching by the magic of Pixar animation. Also well-worth admiring are the sweeping views from space, the creative yet disturbing vision of what strange luxuries a future space vacation might offer, and the innovative use of trash in a future cityscape. Underneath the slapstick comedy and touching love story is a poignant message about the folly of human greed and its potential effects on earth and the entire human race.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000VBJEEG", "B001KVZ6FW", "B00007LVCM", "B00BG0RSJ4", "B00AFEX83C", "0736424229", "B00005JN4W", "B00005JNQS", "B0042U94UQ", "B00E9ZATJO", "B001OMU6UM", "B00005JNS0", "B0030IIZ4M", "B0034JKZ86", "B002ZG97YM", "B002WJI2QQ", "B004HO6I4M", "B008YWY0HK", "B0012EM5D8", "B0006UEVT0", "B009SZCC9U", "B004G600A4", "B00AAXFYPI", "B00F522C7C", "B008Z1LBU4", "B00CTNYLQA", "B003H9M1Q2", "B000AAF1TU", "B008JFUQ16", "B000ROAK2W", "B000AY74OG", "B00275EHJG", "B00CWM58WY", "B00009M9BK", "B00EV1YZ96", "B001DPHDCY", "B000MV9026", "B001O5LVPI", "0783231474", "B00CQRN3QI", "B00G5G7EXY", "B00I6JOD2S", "B001HN6922", "B00GDT5T9Y", "B0087F7VSY", "B001U2MQE0", "B0030IIYYS", "B00A83075M", "B00H4Z07Q6", "B005LAIH4A", "B000DWMYQ8", "B00CHVJODE", "B0000AOX0O", "B003UESJF6", "B00JK531ES", "B00HLTD2OE", "B0001I561E", "B00BGYO7HG", "B003ZHVJGO", "B001ILFUD2", "B0002YLCOM", "B0039N74CW", "B00004U9WQ", "B00937R6QC", "B00CUDD0C0", "B004EPZ034", "B00004R99S", "B00003CXB4", "B000065V42", "B00005RDSQ", "B004ZBACOE", "B001GCUO7A", "B00AO686JC", "B000AAF1U4", "B0006JMLRK", "B00005JMQZ", "B0043X1FOK", "B00C7JGDBW", "B001JRB17Y", "B001KVZ6G6", "B00005TN8K", "B00005JMFH", "B00E9ZATKI", "B001ILFUDC", "B000V1Y44G", "B00003CX8Y", "B0011U52E2", "B00EBBGLFC", "B000YERP2S", "B00009YXAW", "B00003CXCQ", "B002NZK5SW", "B000G75AZC", "B00CNW9ZI6", "B0084IHVGG", "B00947N6D8", "B004LWZW7Y"], "bought_together": ["B001KVZ6FW", "B000VBJEEG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004HO6I4M", "B001KVZ6FW", "B00I6JOD2S", "B00005JN4W"]}, "price": 17.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 319062}, "asin": "7883706837", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51u-jDIxUZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)"}

{"description": "It's very rare indeed for a single DVD to function as pure entertainment and a valuable archive of animation history, but this award-winning Lumivision disc offers all that and more. Once hailed as &quot;America's Greatest Cartoonist,&quot; Winsor McCay (1869-1934) was a master draftsman and illustrator who began his career as a newspaper illustration artist and editorial cartoonist in the late 1890s and later created the milestone comic strips &quot;Dreams of the Rarebit Fiend&quot; (1904) and &quot;Little Nemo in Slumberland&quot; (1905). McCay then advanced to become one of animation's true pioneers, and this exemplary DVD collects every surviving film that McCay ever made. His best-known short,Gertie the Dinosaur(1914), not only promoted the public's ongoing fascination with dinosaurs, but its title character (a lovable brontosaurus) was perhaps the first prehistoric creature in movie history to be imbued with expressive behavior and human characteristics. Another highlight isThe Sinking of the Lusitania, an anti-German World War I propaganda masterpiece from 1918. Lumivision's DVD spans McCay's creative output from 1911 to 1921, and also includes extensive liner notes by animation historian John Canemaker. Predating Walt Disney's earliest efforts by as much as a decade, McCay's amusing and finely crafted films offer a perfectly preserved treat for animation lovers and general viewers alike.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000687E3", "0896596877", "B00000ICR4", "B003ZMEYW0", "B005MY2J12", "B00HAHJK34", "B000P296AS", "B001GNG2WU", "B0006L0LG6", "B000BQ7JW0", "B003XREN0K", "630507559X", "B0013K8J90", "B001ED3JEQ", "B00D4C5GXC", "1423180275", "B000ZOXDK0", "B0062KMDWU", "B000VE4UCO", "B00D8HNRBG", "B00E1RTEDW", "B00006RCLC", "B006YTL3W0", "B000BQ7JVG", "B001OD8E4G", "B008VPCL6M", "B00006II6O", "B00ADXU67Q", "B00E1RTER8", "B00FGVS07S", "B0014VPFHW", "B001B23ED6", "B000MQ4WP6", "B00004Z4TJ", "B00004W45K", "B0000BWVAH", "B000AP31V0", "0520261127", "B001KVZ6LQ", "B00D4C6780", "B001ANHYCI", "B00006JMQH", "B0002S64UA", "0415115973", "6305472424", "B004I2XWMO", "B00005JKGX", "B007TZUZN6", "0486213471", "1606996878", "383654511X", "0452259932", "B001A8HTXC", "B00004R99D", "B008CI19PW", "B005BYBZKY", "B00004Z4TL", "B000V1Y44G", "B000H7J9OY", "B000FVQLYI", "1933160497", "B00005JMJG", "B0000AYJXS", "B0019NB9A2", "B00009XN8Y", "B000P4X21K", "B00004Y2QQ", "B0000C2IX8", "B002KFOEUK", "B0018W2L0G", "B00006IUII", "B00000I20B", "B00008RGZP", "B00001U0OH", "097416643X", "B000MNOY0C", "B003GZ3QYI", "B00186PSA2", "6305907625"], "bought_together": ["B0000687E3"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0896596877", "0486213471", "B0006L0LG6", "1933160497"]}, "price": 24.95, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 342362}, "asin": "B00000ICR5", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51MNMEX6B8L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Winsor McCay: Animation Legend"}
{"description": "Come meet Mark Twain. OK, true, the humorist has been dead for more years than we care to remember, and not many of us around today were alive to hear what he sounded like.  But Hal Holbrook is so spectacular in his one-man performance that you could swear you were listening to Twain himself.  The gravelly voice, the lined face, the slow shuffle, and cigar-induced throat clearings seem so natural that you'll have difficulty recognizing Holbrook beneath the white suit, the gray hair, and the handlebar mustache.Mark Twain Tonight!began as a Broadway show in the 1960s and was filmed as a CBS special in 1967.  Yet you'd never know it, because the humor, which is more than a century old, is still laugh-out-loud funny today. Twain--I mean, Holbrook--gives a monologue that is rambling, intelligent, and humorous as he culls together commentary from a variety of Twain sources. From dachshund hounds, politics, and patriotism to cigar smoking, memory loss, and religion, this 90-minute video leaps from subject to subject as we're entertained by material that's as fresh today as it was when it was written in the 1800s.--Jenny Brown", "related": {"also_bought": ["630272001X", "B00005UT2J", "B000BITUI4"], "bought_together": ["630272001X"], "also_viewed": ["B00005UT2J", "B000BITUI4"]}, "price": 8.95, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 328095}, "asin": "B00000IPGJ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZHMNYH5DL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Mark Twain Tonight [VHS]"}

The continual peppering of in-jokes and cultural references becomes less irksome on video. That there's no majesty or awe invested in the beloved Greek legends also seems less of an error. Also on the plus side is the bounciest Alan Menken music sinceLittle Shop of Horrors. With Zeus's blood in his veins, young Hercules's amazing strength makes him an outcast (sorry, that still doesn't fly), so he trains with a satyr named Phil to become a hero. Along the way Herc meets Meg, a common mortal who falls hard for him. They're both against the jocular Hades, who has to destroy Hercules to take over Olympus.

{"description": "Like many of the clips that make up the bulk of its content, theSaturday Night Live 25th Anniversaryspecial suffers from that malady specific to almost everySNLsketch: it starts out brilliantly, loses steam about halfway through, then slowly but gamely limps to the finish line with occasional spurts of humor. This special (which actually marks the show's 24th anniversary, but never you mind about those small details!) gathered almost all of theSaturday Night Livealumni--well, the funny ones, anyway--for a celebration of the show's entrenchment in the cultural landscape. It's basically an occasion to show alotof clips, ranging in time from the Coneheads to Mary Katherine Gallagher, put together in a sprightly, rapid-pace manner and interspersed with occasional live audience-interaction bits. An hysterically funny Bill Murray kicks things off as a lounge singer at an Indian reservation casino who hobnobs with the celebrity audience members; Tom Hanks, a fave guest host, offers up a lively Q&A; session (with a dryly funny Christopher Walken, among others); and Billy Crystal revives his Fernando persona to great effect. Dan Aykroyd, Laraine Newman, and Steve Martin provide the best cast tribute, warmly remembering John Belushi while wryly offering up memorabilia for online auction, and Jan Hooks introduces a heartfelt short film featuring her and the late Phil Hartman. Other cast members, with the notable absence of Eddie Murphy and the surprise appearance of Norm MacDonald, pop up for various intros of clips--some are funny (Dennis Miller), some are not (Adam Sandler), some are obviously uncomfortable (David Spade), but at about the halfway mark it all starts to wear on you, like most tribute shows. Still, the stable of classic skits (including a surprisingly strong showing from the current cast) make this worth sticking around for.

{"description": "It's difficult to create a film that's fast paced, exciting, and aesthetically appealing without diluting its dialogue.Run Lola Run, directed and written by Tom Tykwer, is an enchanting balance of pace and narrative, creating a universal parable that leaps over cultural barriers. This is the story of young Lola (Franka Potente) and her boyfriend Manni (Moritz Bleibtreu). In the space of 20&nbsp;minutes, they must come up with 100,000&nbsp;deutsche marks to pay back a seedy gangster, who will be less than forgiving when he finds out that Manni incompetently lost his cash to an opportunistic vagrant. Lola, confronted with one obstacle after another, rides an emotional roller coaster in her high-speed efforts to help the hapless Manni--attempting to extract the cash first from her double-dealing father (appropriately a bank manager), and then by any means necessary. From this point nothing goes right for either protagonist, but just when you think you've figured out the movie, the director introduces a series of brilliant existential twists that boggle the mind. Tykwer uses rapid camera movements and innovative pauses to explore the theme of cause and effect. Accompanied by a pulse-poundingsoundtrack, we follow Lola through every turn and every heartbreak as she and Manni rush forward on a collision course with fate.

{"description": "Screwedwas another nail in the coffin of formerSaturday  Night Livewisecracker Norm MacDonald, following his dismal previous film,Dirty Work. However, whileScrewedisn't particularly funny (the  jokes about dentures, dog poop, and dead bodies are pretty much as old as the  hills), the plot exerts a perverse interest; for most of the movie, it's  genuinely unpredictable. MacDonald plays Willard, the butler-chauffer, all-purpose flunky of Mrs. Crock, the wealthy, penny-pinching owner of a pastry  company. Fed up with her abuse, Willard and his friend Rusty (David Chappelle  fromBlue Streakand200 Cigarettes) connive to kidnap her dog  Muffin. But Muffin escapes and returns home; the ransom note is assumed to be  for Willard himself. Rusty and Willard run with the idea, sending in a videotape  of himself being held prisoner. When a detective starts getting a little too  close, they panic and decide to fake Willard's death... Okay, none of it makes  much sense, but in a world of ridiculously formulaic movies that slavishly  follow every screenwriting clich&eacute;,Screwedseems like a brief  oasis of narrative invention. Of course, it still isn't funny. And by the end,  it's lost whatever spark of imagination that got it started. Too bad. It's  written by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski, the screenwriters responsible  forProblem Child, but also forEd WoodandThe People vs.  Larry Flynt--they should stick to biographies.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792842162", "B003NHMYI8", "B004V2S4QK", "B0009PVZ9Q", "B0006HBZE2", "B00000K3U4", "B000H7J9YE", "B000068MBS", "B000M9CB4W", "B0000399WD", "155890834X", "B00006CXI1", "B000095J1K", "B00003CXP4", "B000063RQO", "B00003CXPS", "0783225490", "B0000TWMQ6", "B00004RF89", "B0006HBZEW", "B00AEBB8FQ", "B00018YCIM", "B00005KA6V", "B00AEBBA2C", "B00AG4714S", "B001G5T6GW", "B000FDEV48", "B00AEFY6TW", "B000CNESTE", "B000FZETIE", "B000U1ZV8U", "0783230338", "B00AEBB99Q", "B000P0J09M", "B0006Q93CO", "B000A3XYIM", "B000K405CY", "B00363WGBO", "B00AEBB9AA", "B000PHX5P0", "B000065K4K", "B00005OCJP", "B00004TJMW", "B00008EY9G", "B0016MJ6J2", "B00E56GB12", "B003VPX5Y4", "B00006RCNV", "B00E8G5HZ0", "B000EQ45CE", "B004H4AD2U", "B000BVM1R8", "B00GMV8M2Y", "B00AEBB95K", "B000B5XOWU", "B000EMGJAO", "B0006H32EI", "0767821467", "B000J4P9P8", "B00BTYPWDQ", "B000BBOUCC", "B000069HQ2", "B0009PVZD2", "B0009HKH6Q", "B0001LQJMQ", "B0000VV55I", "B002GIBVVQ", "6305161860", "B00003CXE4", "B00441GYVA", "B00008EY6Q", "B000EGDBZ6", "B001BA9FIG", "B0012E2GFK", "B00LB3OB5A", "B000071ZZJ", "B000BUE5FA", "B000VG66XS", "B000EOMB9U", "B00005UQ9W", "B0000648ZQ", "B001QB9H10", "B0000WN0UU", "B0001Z4OXS", "B00005PJ8T", "0780622561", "B00005JMYI", "B00003CXGA", "B002ZG97B0", "B000AYELVA", "B001AGXEAG"], "bought_together": ["0792842162", "B0009PVZ9Q"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0792842162", "B0009PVZ9Q", "B004V2S4QK", "B0006HBZE2"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 93196}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.96, "brand": "Universal Studios", "asin": "B00003CWQ9", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/2177R08K7CL.jpg", "title": "Screwed"}

{"description": "In its third foray into animated features, DreamWorks came up with something unfortunate: the routine animated picture. Plagued with production problems (it was originally conceived as a mold-breaking PG-13 adventure), the likable film is a Hope/Crosby-style road picture about two scalawags who stumble upon the Latin American paradise of El Dorado, the mythical city with riches of gold. Kenneth Branagh and Kevin Kline are quite fun as Miguel and Tuilo, two Spanish con artists who are shipwrecked in the New World with a scene-stealing horse. The pair follow a map to the secret city where their loyalty will be tested: do they return home rich men or continue to live in this paradise? Of course there are some obstacles: a high priest (Armand Assante) is locked in a power struggle with the benevolent chief (Edward James Olmos) and the perfunctory girlfriend (Rosie Perez) puts the two friends at odds. Like too many of the animated features of its time,The Road to El Doradoimpresses only on a visual level (it's drenched in gorgeous greens and golds). The story and Elton John's songs are quite forgettable; only Branagh and Kline's playful banter keeps the film alive. The PG rating is for some bare backsides and a suggestion of off-screen sex that should soar right over the little ones' heads. Slick and light, it's a fine 83-minute entertainment for ages 5 and up, including the nondiscriminating adult.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005RDVV", "B00004YNUH", "B00003CXQX", "0783236689", "6305229449", "B000035Z2S", "6300275310", "B0000C8ASG", "0788805843", "B00005JLR1", "155890641X", "0788802194", "6302642248", "B00005JL95", "6303534422", "0788805533", "6302526574", "B000028U3S", "B00003CXJ3", "6304401132", "B00016JF2W", "6304290888", "6303314015", "6303392350", "B00005JKDQ", "B0007A2GSM", "B0000AQZYM", "6305326940", "B000035Z46", "B00000ICHA", "B00000I7Q3", "6300274268", "B0006JMLT8", "6302787068", "6303122647", "6305940932", "6304873441", "B0000E32WB", "6303206204", "0788806270", "B0009ZHJ82", "B00006IUM9", "0788803743", "B000089G5P", "B00005T7H1", "B00029LO18", "B00000ICHI", "6305319138", "B000BAVLYI", "B0002YLCHE", "B00005JKX3", "6302320402", "6304978286", "0792839420", "6302481805", "B00003CXXI", "B000063V8N", "6304434340", "6303326781", "B00005LL26", "B0000524CZ", "6304155972", "B00003CXQ0", "0788811002", "6305177473", "B00004R99N", "B00006CXK5", "B00000JYLP", "B00001IVFU", "6303991408", "B00005JMQY", "B00008Y47S", "B00006G8LB", "B00003CXHR", "B00005JKYF", "B00000J2JA", "B00003CXQ6", "B00008G9B8", "6304089627", "0792839129", "6303486894", "0783230095", "B00000GUNY", "B00007AJLB", "B00005MEP8", "B00004WG2B", "B00003CXDU", "630018403X", "B00005JLET", "B0000CABL6", "B00005LKLF", "1560395737", "6305093016", "B00005QATG", "0790720434", "B00005LOUS", "0788812181", "6301017129", "B0006432SW"], "bought_together": ["B00005RDVV", "B00003CXQX"], "also_viewed": ["B00003CXJ3", "B00000I7Q3", "B0000C8ASG", "B0006JMLT8", "B00003CXQX", "B00000GUNY", "B00005JMQY", "6304089767", "0783230095", "B00006IUM9", "B00003CXDU", "B00003CXXI", "B000035Z2S", "B00005RDVV", "B00006CXK5", "0788805533", "B00004YNUH", "6304089201", "0788805843", "6305229449", "B00016JF2W", "6302320402", "B00000JGOQ", "B00005JKDQ", "0783236689", "B0044RFTCE", "6303314015", "B0030IIZ4M", "0788812807", "B0039N74CW", "B0000524CZ", "6305942285", "6304873441", "6303939015", "0788806270", "B00006G8LB", "B00005JLR1", "6303983812", "B00EZH0BXA", "B00004YNUM", "6302787068", "6302642248", "B000035Z46", "6304978286", "6305940932", "B00003CXHR", "B0007A2GSM", "0792839129", "B000028U3S", "B00005LL26", "B00003CX7L", "B00AFEX83C", "6303036813", "078881172X", "B00005JN4W", "6304400551", "B0000D14JV", "155890641X", "6301792734"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 120057}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.95, "brand": "", "asin": "B00003CXG6", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Y2FMMYXFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Road to El Dorado [VHS]"}
{"description": "Many Hollywood directors should follow Rod Lurie's lead and invite their stars to do the DVD commentary. Oscar nominee Joan Allan joins Lurie, turning the commentary track into an enjoyable conversation. It tends to be a lovefest at times but does give insight into the relationship between a lead actor and director during filmmaking. Over the end credits, Lurie mentions the brouhaha that actor (and producer) Gary Oldman started when he made discouraging comments about the film's final cut. It's interesting to note none of Oldman's work ends up in the dozen deleted scenes shown on the DVD. The scenes have much more meat on the bone than most and illustrate some curious character development.

{"description": "The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai: Across the 8th Dimensionis one of the most agreeably insane movies ever made. Peter Weller stars as Buckaroo, an acclaimed neurosurgeon, particle physicist, and, of course, rock star. He travels with the Hong Kong Cavaliers, a band of hard-rocking scientists who are also really good dressers. Buckaroo's interdimensional experiments with his Operation Overthruster throw him (and the Earth) straight into the middle of an alien war, and before you know it, he's got just a few hours to save the world. Confused? Hang on, we're only 10 minutes into the movie.Buckaroo Banzaihurls you right into the middle of its comic-book universe and keeps going at a breakneck pace. It's chock-full of overlapping jokes (even as we're trying to make sense of Dr. Lizardo's hospital room, a voice calmly announces that \"lithium is no longer available on credit\" over the PA system), hilarious throwaway dialogue (\"You're like Jerry Lewis: you give me hope to carry on.\"), and weirdness just for the sheer joy of it (\"Why is there a watermelon there?\" \"I'll tell you later.\"). You'll want to watch it at least twice--there's just no way to catch everything the first time around. Ellen Barkin has a terrific time doing a dead-on film noir moll parody as Penny Priddy, and John Lithgow turns in a brilliant manic performance as Dr. Lizardo/John Whorfin. There is no reason not to own this movie unless you are cold and dead inside. Laugh while you can, Monkey Boys.--Ali Davis", "related": {"bought_together": ["6301352238"], "also_viewed": ["B00FTWJ1C2", "630213014X", "6303507565"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 308345}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.94, "brand": "", "asin": "B000050NS2", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ASRQPH7HL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai [VHS]"}
{"description": "Russ Duritz (Bruce Willis) is an ultracynical, 40-year-old L.A. image consultant who fashions bogus fa&ccedil;ades for scumbag clients. Oblivious to his own need for a makeover, he's a tyrant in the office (to the chagrin of his sarcastic assistant, played to perfection by Lily Tomlin), and he's emotionally unavailable to the morally centered woman (Emily Mortimer) who senses goodness beneath Russ's hardened veneer. Not a moment too soon, a pudgy kid (Spencer Breslin) mysteriously appears in Russ's life, revealing himself to be Rusty Duritz--that is, Russ's 8-year-old self, arriving by some magic to put the adult Russ's life into beneficial perspective. This variation onA Christmas Carolhas Rusty guiding Russ on a tour of his past to reveal how he became a loveless, hard-shelled loser. It takes a bit of smarmy chicken-soup psychology to explain it all, butThe Kidis an otherwise charming and involving fantasy, suggesting that perhaps we'd all benefit from a bit of counseling by our younger selves. Written with admirable restraint by Audrey Wells (who brought a similar appeal toThe Truth About Cats and Dogs) and directed by Jon Turteltaub (Cool Runnings), the movie doesn't force its supernatural elements or attempt to explain Rusty's existence. It's just a fable for our modern age and a reminder to embrace the better angels of our nature. Delivered with an easy blend of humor and sentiment, that message makesThe Kidan unexpected pleasure.

{"description": "Sidney Poitier is seldom praised as a pioneer of blaxploitation, but that's what he is inThey Call Me Mister Tibbs. This sequel's title is cribbed from its groundbreaking predecessor,In the Heat of the Night, but similarities end there, since this engaging murder mystery owes more to \"blaxpo\" and the urban police procedurals that dominated film and TV in the early 1970s. Poitier's got plenty of proto-funk charisma (and a Quincy Jones groove) as San Francisco detective Virgil Tibbs, dominating his Caucasian colleagues with quiet fortitude and sure-fire instincts. His latest case is rife with likely suspects, including a Bible-thumping reformer (Martin Landau) and a sleazy landlord (Anthony Zerbe).

{"description": "With so many romantic comedies revolving around eternally adolescent men with self-centered philosophies and terminal commitment problems, it's kind of nice to see one of them take stock of himself. Tim Daly, a chef with unconventional methods (try his dishwasher fish), embarks on a quest through past loves with sincere questions about why things didn't work out. Boyish Daly is charming as the rogue romantic, and his tour through broken affairs gives some fine actresses comic-showcase scenes--Jamie Gertz, Laura Leighton, Elizabeth Pe&ntilde;a, Mimi Rogers, and Katy Selverstone among them. Olivia d'Abo is his current flame, a would-be psychic restaurateur who sets out after him, and Melora Hardin is an old gal pal who just may be his best chance at a fresh start. This isn't quite theHigh Fidelitything--Daly's quest is a well-meaning attempt at personal growth, not a sour tour of self-justification--but then this is hardly as ambitious or revealing. He doesn't learn anything that a little serious self-examination would reveal just as well, but that's beside the point. It's a warm and winning little comedy about growing up, letting go, and opening up, with deftly played comedy and generous performances.--Sean Axmaker", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 205308}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "title": "Seven Girlfriends", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0009I7NGM", "B00AEBB9UK", "B00005MM6A", "B0000C2IR4", "B002OQZE5E", "B001KZVQKC", "B0000UHCME", "6302958822", "6300128490", "6302236266", "6303926177", "B000B6H1YG", "B000228EHM", "630310665X", "B0009PW3RY", "6305181136"]}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51BZ9957J8L._SY300_.jpg", "asin": "B000055WFX"}

{"description": "True-blue Agatha Christie fans know better than anyone that the creator of Miss Marple and Hercule Poirot did not always write crime-solving procedurals.Endless Night, published in 1968, is a perfect example of the moody, psychological thriller Christie sometimes explored, particularly in the late years of her career. This 1972 adaptation, scripted and directed by seasoned British filmmaker Sidney Gilliat, is indeed a strange duck: a compelling tale of small, unsettling phenomena and events, but with no defining mystery, no apparent crime to pull the details together--not until quite late in the story, that is. Hayley Mills and Hywel Bennett, partnered together in several films (The Family Way,Twisted Nerve) during the 1960s and '70s, play an American heiress and an underemployed London chauffeur who marry and move into a dream house designed for them by a world-class architect (Per Oscarsson). In short order, things begin to get mighty weird. A crazy old woman stomps around the couple's property, whispering ambiguous warnings. The bride's nuisance of a sister (Britt Ekland) moves in, and a handful of disapproving relatives keep popping up to belittle the hero. Where this is all leading is entirely unexpected--Christie and Gilliat really have us falling without a parachute for a while--yet it's exciting and tragic all at once. Nice performances all around, with special admiration for Oscarsson's role as the dying architect.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B003XF1VY8", "B000199JJI", "B0033PSH54", "B00005QBZL", "B006DHATBE", "B00007GZZW", "B00GAXASKS", "B00008K772", "B00005JLJC", "B00GWXI16O", "B001KP2J3K", "B001KP2J3U", "B00HUAGYF8", "B000GB5M1U", "B00005JMVV", "B000GB5M1A", "B00GWXI2MC", "B003YPKBF2", "B001KZOVJK", "B00A0HT99G", "B004VLYHNA", "B00005JN0Q", "B000CSTK38", "B002MUAXJY", "B00GHH9I62", "B00JJRLFTU", "B001KP2J44", "B002Q3MYA8", "B0001E5TKQ", "B00GWXI2RM", "B004WMOSNM", "B00GS08Y3Q", "B001EJZNDU", "B00E44EZUE", "B00GZ0NSLW", "B00GWXI1F0", "B00GWXHYPI", "B0000CDRW2", "B001UWOLQG", "B00IXXVCT4", "B00JX3SHIC", "B0090XLDO0", "B0007GP83G", "B0000CDRW3", "B00GWXI20E", "B00GD7UO6E", "B003YCI238", "B000F4RHBG", "B00HHYF55C", "B00BDSRM4K", "B00C888LOO", "B005ZVINFS", "B00ICWO1LC", "B00A27O5AW", "B00AEFYO5I", "B00CDV4OEC", "B0047CG95W", "B00000JGHT", "B000GB5M1K", "B00EF0NYVI", "B000068UE9", "B00005RDRO", "B00DZP1C9K", "B00IF0KAYS", "B00A8KJLPM", "B00H4ZEFTQ", "B00ESK1PES", "B001FBPSW8", "B003AND1TG", "B00K6D1QV8", "B00G4NV7B8", "B0028AENVC", "B000NOK0KI", "B00CDV4LEA", "B00GAXASLC", "B0050N0US4", "B009YX8MKO", "B00EJSMOO4", "B004HHX9H8", "B00I9BU5ZM", "B00I567EWS", "B00HQLZCIQ", "B00BBI7EZY", "B009DS5OEM", "B0001NBMEE", "B00DC5K1FO", "B000AP04M4", "B00ESG43AU", "B007T40GRW", "B000BRBAAG", "B00068RYZK", "B00CBVWWLQ", "B003UCA4OW", "B00GAXASK8", "B00D49YE4W", "B001HSNTGQ", "0553350242", "B000GFVHLU", "B00ALTQRNO"], "bought_together": ["B003XF1VY8", "B0033PSH54"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001KZOVJK", "B003XF1VY8", "B001KP2J3U", "B00005QBZL"]}, "price": 19.98, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 33124}, "asin": "B000059LGD", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51394lfRocL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Agatha Christie's Endless Night"}

{"description": "The classic science fiction novel by H.G. Wells becomes this big-budget adventure directed by the author's great-grandson Simon Wells. Guy Pearce stars as Alexander Hartdegen, a scientist, professor, and inventor in 1895 New York City who believes that time travel is possible. The sudden and unexpected death of his fianc&#x82;e spurs Alexander to build a time machine, which he hopes to use in an effort to change the past. When he is unable to change the past, Alexander hurls himself more than 800,000 years into the future, seeking answers about the nature of time, but instead encountering a dystopian world where humanity has divided up into two races, the peaceful Eloi and the subterranean Morlocks. Befriending the beautiful Eloi woman Mara (pop singer Samantha Mumba), Alexander must set out to save her from the underground world of the Morlocks when she is captured by them. Along the way, he is aided by Vox (Orlando Jones), a bio-mechanical being from the 21st century. Ultimately, Alexander makes a shocking discovery about the true nature of the Eloi and Morlocks and decides that the only way to change the future is to alter the present. Due to exhaustion, director Wells was briefly replaced during the last few weeks of production by Gore Verbinski, director of The Mexican (2001). The Time Machine co-stars Jeremy Irons and Mark Addy.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0045HCJSA", "B001BGS17Q", "B000CZ0PNK", "B00LNBQ8SI", "B00LMCDHMS", "B00LNBQ8UG", "B00ANDFL3A", "B00IYJFB2G", "0780619951", "B0000639BZ", "B00003CXXP", "B00003CWU3", "630587493X", "B00K2CHVSK", "B00007JMD8", "B00005JNTI", "B00L4K3MLE", "B00005JKU0", "B00AEBB8VK", "B000FVQLKW", "B00K2CHWYI", "B00LCAD24S", "B00005JKFR", "B001SGEUYW", "0780622650", "B005FQ2H8W", "B0019ESNGY", "B002945DU2", "B00AEBB8QK", "B00020HAWE", "B00000G3PA", "B00009NHC0", "0790750201", "B000HEWEDK", "B001P9N94E", "B00IKM5N1G", "B00008G8M5", "B00005JL78", "B000O78KWE", "B0000844I8", "B0050MB5KM", "B00007G1YQ", "B008JFUO36", "B00D9EJFZA", "B0000AUHOH", "B00133KHBK", "B002UZCJ8Y", "B00IKM5LXG", "B000096IAC", "B00003CXKM", "B0016I0AJG", "B00008G8M4", "B000YDOOHI", "B00K7IPGS6", "B003NH3X5Q", "B008JFUNHI", "B00005N5S5", "0767812166", "B001EAWMGA", "B0045HCJ0S", "B002NZK5SM", "B00ECW9UJY", "B004B93RDS", "B001AR0D4A", "B00HWWUQYY", "B0009X75J2", "B000K7VHQ4", "B00004W46I", "B00009ATIX", "B000SFJ4K4", "B000HC2LZS", "B000KGGIV4", "B003BJO8KU", "B00AZMFJYA", "B00008438U", "B000QQJ3Q0", "B001BSBBNK", "6305090564", "B000BUNZY2", "B006VRRGNK", "079073639X", "B0074JOUHE", "B00AEBBA72", "B00J5LXMTG", "B000C20VNM", "B001A4VH3Y", "B00JL6L4UY", "B000063UR0", "B00079HZS4", "B00AEFXT7W", "B002BFBB4Q", "0783226063", "B000MX7V70", "0783231032", "B00005Y6XR", "B00BTYPW7C", "B00006JDRG", "0783240961", "1558908846", "B0013LL2Z2"], "bought_together": ["B0045HCJSA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0045HCJSA", "B001BGS17Q", "B00AIBZMD6", "B0090SI56Y"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 14168}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 15.26, "brand": "Dreamworks Skg", "asin": "B00005JKLZ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RZF2PBJAL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Time Machine"}

{"description": "WithThe Return of the King, the greatest fantasy epic in film history draws to a grand and glorious conclusion. Director Peter Jackson's awe-inspiring adaptation of the Tolkien classicThe Lord of the Ringscould never fully satisfy those who remain exclusively loyal to Tolkien's expansive literature, but as a showcase for physical and technical craftsmanship it is unsurpassed in pure scale and ambition, setting milestone after cinematic milestone as the brave yet charmingly innocent Hobbit Frodo (Elijah Wood) continues his mission to Mordor, where he is destined to destroy the soul-corrupting One Ring of Power in the molten lava of Mount Doom. While the heir to the kingdom of Men, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), endures the massive battle at Minas Tirith with the allegiance of the elf Legolas (Orlando Bloom), dwarf Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) and the great wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen), Frodo and stalwart companion Samwise Gamgee (Sean Astin) must survive the schizoid deceptions of Gollum, who remains utterly convincing as a hybrid of performance (by Andy Serkis) and subtly nuanced computer animation.Jackson and cowriters Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens have much ground to cover; that they do so with intense pacing and epic sweep is impressive enough, but by investing greater depth and consequence in the actions of fellow Hobbits Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd), they ensure thatReturn of the Kingmaintains the trilogy's emphasis on intimate fellowship. While several major characters appear only briefly, and one (Christopher Lee's evil wizard, Saruman) relegated entirely to the extended version on DVD, Jackson is to be commended for his editorial acumen; like Legolas the archer, his aim as a filmmaker is consistently true, and he remains faithful to Tolkien's overall vision. IfReturnsuffers from too many endings, as some critic suggested, it's only because the epic's conclusion is so loyally inclusive of the actors--most notably Astin--who gave it such strength to begin with. By ending theLOTRtrilogy with noble integrity and faith in the power of imaginative storytelling,The Return of the King, like its predecessors, will stand as an adventure for the ages.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JKZV", "B00003CWT6", "B00BEZTMFY", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B002ZG980U", "B002PMV9FG", "B008UZA8FY", "B001NGML48", "B00005JM5E", "B001GZ6QC4", "B005COPWZW", "B008M4C1EO", "B00HFFE8HE", "039548930X", "B000W7F5SS", "B000I0RQVI", "B002VWNIDG", "B000E6EK2Y", "B001BYMX4A", "B004M1A21K", "B007K3JFUQ", "B001DHXT20", "B001UV4XHY", "0345325818", "B003Y5H54W", "B00005JNJV", "B00E5I2M6I", "B000A3XY5A", "B004LWZWGA", "B000U7WV1Y", "B005LXQLRW", "B001OQCV6A", "B000E8M0VA", "B004SIP8ZM", "B000EHRVMY", "0618640150", "B003ZK99NQ", "B0013FDM7E", "B00005JPH2", "B000UNYK4E", "B009JBWOU0", "B00003CX5P", "B00008G8M5", "B00GKOJ98E", "B004LWZW42", "B000H30B2C", "B000P0J0C4", "B00CZDLGDU", "B000M341QE", "B00008G8M4", "B000FKO5QK", "B00HWWUQYY", "B007SPPANM", "B008JFUO72", "B001DJLD1M", "0345538374", "B00AEFY5B6", "B00005JKCH", "B004SIP9U6", "B000YGGNMO", "B00E5I2M9K", "0618126988", "B005OCFGTO", "B00E8S2JZ4", "6305313687", "B004AKCME8", "B0002KVUKM", "B000AARKOO", "B0006GAO5Y", "B000K7VHQ4", "B002ZG997C", "B00AHTYI5M", "B008JFUS0U", "B0042MEQVG", "B00275EGWY", "B00E9PMML2", "B008UZDXEW", "B004SIP7F8", "B00116GEJS", "B00003CXI1", "B003ZKBELG", "B003Y5H5EW", "B000V4UFZK", "B0007PLLBU", "B001DTPZNY", "B002O3Z50Q", "B001GCUO1Q", "B000LP6KNU", "B005G4TJUC", "B00AW0KHTM", "B002ZG97YM", "054792819X", "B00AEFXZJE", "B0000YEEGM", "B002IPFWTE", "B001ECQ75A", "B000065U1N", "B0051MKNV8", "B000W796OM", "B00J49R1BY"], "bought_together": ["B00005JKZV", "B00003CWT6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00HFFE8HE", "B00003CWT6", "B00005JKZV", "B00BEZTMFY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 1589}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.49, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00005JKZY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HS7iSFv5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)"}

{"description": "A Beautiful Mindmanages to twist enough pathos out of John Nash's incredible life story to redeem an at-times goofy portrayal of schizophrenia. Russell Crowe tackles the role with characteristic fervor, playing the Nobel prize-winning mathematician from his days at Princeton, where he developed a groundbreaking economic theory, to his meteoric rise to the cover ofForbesmagazine and an MIT professorship, and on through to his eventual dismissal due to schizophrenic delusions. Of course, it is the delusions that fascinate director Ron Howard and, predictably, go astray. Nash's other world, populated as it is by a maniacal Department of Defense agent (Ed Harris), an imagined college roommate who seems straight out ofDead Poets Society, and an orphaned girl, is so fluid and scriptlike as to make the viewer wonder if schizophrenia is really as slick as depicted. Crowe's physical intensity drags us along as he works admirably to carry the film on his considerable shoulders. No doubt the story of Nash's amazing will to recover his life without the aid of medication is a worthy one, his eventual triumph heartening. Unfortunately, Howard's flashy style is unable to convey much of it.--Fionn Meade", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004SIP7ZS", "B0043X1FL8", "B004FQX5B6", "B00AEFZ63M", "B0000YEEGM", "B00003CWQR", "B000ARTN3I", "B000EHQU0S", "6305144168", "0767811100", "B000066HAS", "B000P0J0EW", "B00AEFYSWM", "B0002B15ZG", "1451628420", "B00000IQV7", "B000021Y7L", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00AEFY5B6", "B003ASLJQI", "B000XJD3JI", "B004SUDQ22", "B004U7MR1Y", "B00A81MV3U", "B0043X1FM2", "B00B0U2SFE", "B002NZK5UK", "B000N6U0E2", "B003B3NGS6", "B00AEBB9F0", "B00AEBB8NI", "B00004RJ73", "B00003CWRX", "B00125WAWS", "B00005JLSB", "6305428352", "B00008EY60", "0800141806", "B00001ZWUS", "B00011CZRE", "B00AEBB9CS", "6304712936", "0780619587", "B00007GZR5", "B000YAF4MA", "B000KX0IOA", "B004SIP8W0", "B00080ZG10", "B00B9LNPA6", "0783225733", "B003U0AHBO", "B00004BZIY", "B00005JND5", "B000E33VWW", "B003NF97NK", "B0038M2AZA", "B002CPMB9O", "B000P0J0EM", "B000A3XY5A", "B00AFEXRME", "B00005Q4CS", "B000LC55F2", "B00AEBB9SM", "B0006FYOTC", "B000056VP4", "B002WNU0QW", "B000RTB0R6", "0684819066", "B00003CXZ4", "B00AEFY17E", "B000EGDB10", "B002VECM6S", "B002ZG980U", "B001P9KR8U", "B001N44BVQ", "B000LP6KNU", "B0007DFJ0G", "B0002V7ON8", "B0018CWW5K", "B00JPQ1INI", "B0030Y12FU", "B003ELKNH2", "B000K2UGZM", "B00121QGPY", "B0001CNRAM", "B00003CXFV", "0783223609", "B007N31YH0", "B002HK9IDQ", "B005BYBZEK", "B000JJ5F8O", "B00AEFYXJ0", "B003UESJHO", "B00A7MSQSO", "B004SIP9U6", "B00005JL78", "B00012QLB4", "B003UESJH4", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B000K7VHQE"], "bought_together": ["B004SIP7ZS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00C7MW5EI", "B004SIP7ZS", "B001F34HRS", "B00001ZWUS"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 3605}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.99, "brand": "UNI DIST CORP.

{"description": "James Bond DVDs have in general been pretty loaded, butDie Another Dayraises the bar with a two-disc set featuring dynamic DTS 6.1 ES and Dolby Digital 5.1 EX sound that makes good use of the rear speakers. The first commentary track is by Pierce Brosnan and Rosamund Pike (who plays villain Miranda Frost). They weren't together at the time, so their comments are spliced into one track. Brosnan has a good time watching and is proud of the film but also doesn't take himself too seriously (\"They don't teach you this stuff at drama school: 'OK, now you're going to be electrocuted by the bad guy.'\"). Self-proclaimed \"Bond novice\" Pike also is proud of the film and says she's annoyed by people who question whether there's still a need for Bond. On the second commentary track, director Lee Tamahori and producer Michael G. Wilson chat about topics as diverse as casting, Bond lore, and product placements. For more Bond lore, don't overlook the trivia track, which offers pop-up tidbits about the filming and tips on the inside jokes.The centerpiece of the second disc is the 80-minute \"InsideDie Another Day\" documentary, which is a set of featurettes strung together. Topics include the opening surfing sequence; the scenes set in North Korea and Cuba (including Halle Berry's bikini tribute to Ursula Andress); the ice palace; post-production elements such as computer graphics, editing, and music; the car battle (finding strong ice was the key safety issue); and the passing of the \"Q\" torch from Desmond Llewellyn to John Cleese.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000NIBURQ", "B000M53GM2", "B000RPCK1U", "B000NDEXPM", "B000M53GMW", "B000RPCK1K", "B000RPCK24", "B000NIBURG", "B000M53GLS", "B000RPCK1A", "B000NIBUR6", "B000M53GN6", "B001PPLIEG", "B001R10BN2", "B00AQSN7HE", "B000RPCK0Q", "B000M53GNG", "B000NIBUS0", "B000NDEXPC", "B00004RG62", "B000M53GMC", "B007REV4T8", "B00004WEJZ", "B00005JL0I", "B009PN18R2", "B008YAPQX4", "B004BR7XLM", "B009PN3OD8", "B003QO8TOQ", "B000HRMAPE", "B000VNMMR0", "B0000BYRO7", "B00AZFECL8", "B000EGDB10", "B004EPYZUS", "B0004Z33EQ", "B00AIBZMD6", "B009A87Z6U", "B009RO9LKK", "B000SK5Z70", "B00003CXMV", "6305657947", "B00005JLYW", "B00005JN2Z", "B00023B1LC", "B005PTYP70", "B00008G8M4", "B00005JNJV", "B00000G3PA", "B000P0J06K", "B002UZCJ8Y", "B002ZG9864", "0792844068", "B00005JKIP", "0792166736", "0790732238", "B00AS1Q93S", "B003Q6D2B4", "B0002I84N0", "B000U1ZV8K", "B008JFURII", "B00JA3RVG4", "B000MZHW40", "B00026ZG10", "0790732149", "B000FKO3HG", "B000AP04FG", "B008JFUS0U", "B0001FGC1U", "B00005JMQW", "B009L6UDUG", "B00AVWIQZS", "B0013BM63O", "B00005JLRT", "B00E5I2M6I", "B001TK80C0", "B00AZMFJYA", "B0007KZQAM", "B002ZG999U", "B00BUAEYVK", "B009A87ZQU", "B000P0J06U", "B008JFUO72", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B00003CY0V", "B00E5I2MCM", "B0036TGSR6", "B003AWRMBU", "B0000BYRO9", "B008JFUNHI", "B00177YA1K", "6304696221", "B0021L8V0M", "B00006G8FD", "B000UR9T8C", "B002GNOSFM", "B003UESJFQ", "B0006L0LOS", "B000AYELVU"], "bought_together": ["B000NIBURQ", "B000M53GM2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000M53GM2", "B000RPCK1U", "B000M53GN6", "B000RPCK0Q"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 38500}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.0, "brand": "MGM", "asin": "B00005JLBE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51kgPWMuVFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Die Another Day (Widescreen Special Edition)"}

{"description": "For Baby Boomers, owning a season or two of a fondly remembered TV series on DVD is enough to satisfy any nostalgic yearnings.The Man From U.N.C.L.E., though, warrants the full-series treatment. It's a wild '60s flashback to the Espionage era that was ushered in by Ian Fleming's James Bond adventures. According to a series retrospective that's just one of this cleverly packaged set's prodigious extras, Fleming himself was recruited to create a spy series for American television. His contribution was the name \"Napoleon Solo,\" the moniker of a crime boss inGoldfinger. That movie, which would kick Bond and spy mania into overdrive, had not yet opened when viewers were introduced to Robert Vaughn's Solo and David McCallum's Illya Kuryakin, agents of the United Network Command for Law and Enforcement. This covert agency operated out of Del Floria's Tailor Shop in New York under the command of true Brit Alexander Waverly (Leo J. Carroll, playing much the same character he portrayed inNorth by Northwest).The Man from U.N.C.L.E.offered a bit of hope in Cold War America that an American and Russian could work together to stop a common enemy, THRUSH, a ruthless organization bent on world domination. The intriguing conceit ofThe Man From U.N.C.L.E.was to give audiences an empathetic surrogate who would be plucked from their humdrum lives for whirlwind adventures with Solo and Kuryakin. In the pilot episode, Patricia Crowley guest-stars as a housewife who acts as bait to foil the plans of her former college boyfriend, who is plotting the assassination of a world leader. In a series benchmark, \"The Never-Never Affair,\" a pre-Get SmartBarbara Feldon stars as an U.N.C.L.E. translator who unwittingly becomes involved in actual espionage. Seasons one and two are the series' best, with a stellar roster of guest stars (\"The Project Strigas Affair\" features the first onscreen pairing of William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy), stylish direction by directors who would go on to some renown (Michael Ritchie, Richard Donner), smart scripts, and great action (a movie theatre shoot-out in \"The Never-Never Affair\"). In its third season,The Man From U.N.C.L.E.adoptedBatman's campy and absurdist tone with shark-jumping results While this season has its share of groaners (in one episode, Sollo watusis with a gorilla), several \"Affairs\" stand out. Jack Palance and Janet Leigh as a long cool woman in a white dress are great villains in \"The Concrete Overcoat Affair.\" Harlan Ellison wrote the witty \"The Pieces of Fate Affair,\" in which he takes some sly digs at television and literary critics (a THRUSH operative is a book reviewer). Joan Collins makes like Eliza Doolittle in a dual role as a Bronx stripper and a countess in \"The Galatea Affair.\" The series went back to basics inSeason Four, but by then,The Avengerswas a bigger hit and the writing was on the wall for this once trendsetting series. This lavish box set affair contains upward of ten hours of bonus features, including the unaired series pilot, a series retrospective, an interview with a reunited Vaughn and McCallum, dossiers on each season's guest stars, one of theU.N.C.L.E.feature films edited and expanded from a two-part episode, segments about the great gadgets and cool music,U.N.C.L.E.designs and blueprints, and season-specific booklets.This definitive box set does full justice to a series that had such an impact on popular culture (as witness the bonus Tom & Jerry cartoon, \"The Mouse From H.U.N.G.E.R.\"). More than a blast from the past,The Man From U.N.C.L.E.is still a potent blend of \"cloak and swagger.\"--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001MVWMD4", "B005JJCMNU", "B009DA74CK", "B005JJCMO4", "B005DKS1Z8", "B001CQONOA", "B00E5G03I4", "B005JJCMPI", "B00CPTUNR4", "B00IU6HQ4O", "B001E0O8DA", "B005GYXN2M", "B000KLQUT4", "B001B0H7DG", "B00ESFUED6", "B00962R0H4", "B0014BQR3I", "B00EEEHL9G", "B00CPR3RB0", "B00EC9UHVM", "B001HUHBBS", "B00L1WJK2K", "B000BOH8Z0", "B008MIYKS0", "B000EXDS2A", "0312000529", "B008OIQYXM", "B00E96AY20", "B000FOQ03C", "B00L9K2EGS", "B002L9N4O2", "B00IS6WQ2S", "B00IXPWGIS", "B008X8U83K", "B001DHXT6G", "B000K7VHYG", "B000HT3PF6", "B000GUJZ0U", "B009OE2ODY", "B000FFJ87Q", "B000EQ46HI", "B007ZR9H64", "B00HQLZCIQ", "B0012Z36FI", "B00GX7D5G0", "B00C7A8WWO", "B003NOGNQU", "B000N6UF10", "B000UX6TJI", "B000V3JGIS", "B00KDP31US", "B008NNY89A", "B0050MB5AC", "B00144P9RA", "B000BT96FA", "B00D9EJFQY", "B00KUS5YGC", "B001CDLATY", "B008RJ6TTC", "B002C68WOG", "B001DZOCZU", "B00I099JKA", "B00INMLUVU", "B00HMOWA0A", "B008TMISJ6", "B00D9EJFZA", "B00C10EG7A", "B00KTZALDC", "B003W5C0TY", "B00004Y2QO", "B008H6GHII", "B000HWZ4E8", "B00FUABJMS", "B001R1HEMI", "B00JK47BHM", "B000EU1Q3Q", "B00082ZROO", "B001JFKWE4", "B001MT7ZJC", "B00IXD2MU2", "B00DXLO0BI", "B0087GKHXO", "B00B00HUC0", "B008OR5X6M", "B000FI9OEK", "B001666484", "B00HSJ2CSE", "B003QS0E54", "B009TTGKS4", "B0096W46PS", "B00AML73BG", "B006BZ8NSE", "B0030E5PYO", "B003VJTGNE", "B00FNRA0KA", "B003XMKUEI", "B00BAXTYI0", "B0090EDEQE", "B000A5046K", "B003NKU9XM"], "bought_together": ["B005JJCMNU", "B001MVWMD4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00E5G03I4", "B001CQONOA", "B005JJCMNU", "B001MVWMD4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 22598}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 135.28, "brand": "", "asin": "B00005JM5Z", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HwF-jpZtL._SX300_.jpg", "title": "The Man from U.N.C.L.E.: The Complete Series"}
{"description": "A broad science fiction thriller in a classic vein,Equilibriumtakes a respectable stab at aFahrenheit 451-like cautionary fable. The story finds Earth's post-World War III humankind in a state of severe emotional repression: If no one feels anything, no one will be inspired by dark passions to attack their neighbors. Writer-director Kurt Wimmer's monochromatic,Metropolis-influenced cityscape provides an excellent backdrop to the heavy-handed mission of John Preston (Christian Bale), a top cop who busts \"sense offenders\" and crushes sentimental, sensual, and artistic relics from a bygone era. Predictably, Preston becomes intrigued by his victims and that which they die to cherish; he stops taking his mandatory, mood-flattening drug and is even aroused by a doomed prisoner (Emily Watson). Wimmer's wrongheaded martial arts/dueling guns motif is sheer silliness (a battle over a puppy doesn't help), butEquilibriumshould be seen for Bale's moving performance as a man shocked back to human feeling.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00006JDVV", "B000LC55F2", "B000FS9FCG", "B0009A40ES", "B000KX0IM2", "B0007Y08QA", "B00AEFYCW8", "0767805712", "B00005JL78", "B0018O4YT0", "B001FB55HQ", "B00003CXZ4", "B00AEFXCLU", "B000FGGE68", "B000WMA6R8", "B002ZG980U", "B003XURDAY", "B00HOGBXS6", "B00005JPAR", "B000GFLKF8", "B00K2CHX9C", "B00AEFXW8I", "B000XR9L50", "B004XQO90O", "B000N6TX1I", "B000FKO5QK", "B004SIP9Z6", "B007WZTMCI", "B0007DFJ0G", "B000093FLA", "B0073U2FB2", "0783225814", "B000K7VHQ4", "B001OQCVI8", "B00011CZRE", "B000P0J0AQ", "B00000JSJC", "B0000AXE8I", "B008JFUQZ2", "B007X4ECMI", "B002ZG97CO", "B00AZMFJYA", "B008JFUO36", "B004P2VQZC", "B0000AC8LR", "B0045HCJT4", "B00J5LXT6M", "B00AEFY5B6", "B002UZCJ8Y", "B001GZ6QC4", "B00177Y9ZC", "B003UESJHO", "B000XA5K48", "B001DJLD1M", "B008JFUN50", "B005LAIHXQ", "B00K7IPFSM", "B0006IIPIK", "B005LAII8A", "B0013PSTMC", "B008JFUNHI", "B001L57ZYM", "B002QEHPQU", "B0034G4ORC", "B004SIP95G", "0767802519", "B001TOD92C", "B008JFUS0U", "B000087F6L", "B0051MKNV8", "B007WXUVHU", "B005LAIH2C", "B000R9U3B0", "B004LWZW7E", "B000MZHW40", "B00005JNJV", "B00005JPD0", "B000GGSMC6", "B0000ACOXL", "B0085A9HU6", "B009YQJ322", "B003Y5H5GK", "B009MO57H6", "B004LWZW4M", "0800195175", "B002QW7ALM", "B00005JMA8", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B001EAWMGA", "B002O3Z4WU", "B000BW7QWW", "B001GUYB08", "B00005V9HH", "B001UV4XWY", "B00A8MGIZG", "B002GSXKNI", "B00IARA8KM", "B004LWZWGA", "B00005JA8B", "B001QTXM5Y"], "bought_together": ["B000LC55F2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0007Y08QA", "B006ZL1PGG", "B000LC55F2", "B004P7CMJG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 61424}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.34, "brand": "Dimension", "asin": "B00005JLWN", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51K2WVH130L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Equilibrium"}

{"description": "The seemingly obligatory director's commentary is not on this two-disc set of Michael Mann's slick thriller yet the extras are so good you won't miss it. On the surface, there's nothing out of the ordinary here with the exception of a few minutes of rehearsal footage, but everything is just so darn interesting to watch. Mann and his stars dish about the making of the film, including the creation of Cruise's assassin. The nighttime shooting (shot digitally and transferred sublimely) is examined along with a single deleted scene (with a clear explanation on why it was cut). Think the climatic finale aboard a train was shot on a subway for convenience? No, Mann just wanted to control the backgrounds!

{"description": "The Quiet Americanproves that elegant and intelligent filmmaking can be emotionally powerful. Michael Caine plays Thomas Fowler, a British journalist in 1950s Vietnam with a lovely Vietnamese mistress named Phuong  (Do Thi Hai Yen) and a jaded view of the political strife teeming around him. He befriends a seemingly innocuous American named Alden Pyle (Brendan Fraser), who falls in love with Phuong--and slowly, Pyle's real purpose in  Vietnam becomes revealed. Fowler finds that, to hold on to the carefully balanced life he's created for himself, he must make choices he's long avoided. Caine and Fraser are both superb and give a human face to complicated politics; as a result,The Quiet Americanmanages to be  compelling as both history and a story about very specific people embroiled in a very personal conflict.

{"description": "Despite super effects, a huge budget, and the cinematic pedigree of alien-happy Steven Spielberg, this take on H.G. Wells's novel is basically a horror film packaged as a sci-fi thrill ride. Instead of a mad slasher, however, Spielberg (along with writers Josh Friedman & David Koepp) utilizes aliens hell-bent on quickly destroying humanity, and the terrifying results that prey upon adult fears, especially in the post-9/11 world. The realistic results could be a new genre, the grim popcorn thriller; often you feel like you're watching Schindler's List more than Spielberg's other thrill-machine movies (Jaws,Jurassic Park). The film centers on Ray Ferrier, a divorced father (Tom Cruise, oh so comfortable) who witnesses one giant craft destroy his New Jersey town and soon is on the road with his teen son (Justin Chatwin) and preteen daughter (Dakota Fanning) in tow, trying to keep ahead of the invasion. The film is, of course, impeccably designed and produced by Spielberg's usual crew of A-class talent. The aliens are genuinely scary, even when the film--like the novel--spends a good chunk of time in a basement. Readers of the book (or viewers of the deft 1953 adaptation) will note the variation of whom and how the aliens come to Earth, which poses some logistical problems. The film opens and closes with narration from the novel read by Morgan Freeman, but Spielberg could have adapted Orson Welles's words from the famous Halloween Eve 1938 radio broadcast: \"We couldn't soap all your windows and steal all your garden gates by tomorrow night, so we did the best next thing: we annihilated the world.\"--Doug ThomasWar of the Worldsat Amazon.comThe SoundtrackThe War of the Worlds(1953)War of the Worlds - The Complete First Season(TV series)Classic Sci-Fi Movies and Their RemakesAliens Invade on DVDThe Prog-rock Opera (no kidding)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEBB8VK", "B00005JL78", "B001SGEUYW", "B00008G8M4", "B00005JL3T", "B0013FDM7E", "B00AEFXNLY", "B00005JMXX", "B001OQCV2E", "B000VECAD0", "B002O3Z510", "B0002V7OI8", "B000H30B2C", "B000EGDB10", "B00005JN2Z", "B005LAIIMG", "B005PTYP70", "B002O3Z50G", "B0002V7ON8", "B00005JN0T", "B00K2CHW48", "B002SJIO4A", "0783225547", "B008JFUO36", "B00005JKLZ", "B00AS1Q93S", "1936594056", "B004EPYZUS", "B001TUZG4K", "B00AEFXR1K", "B00001ZWUS", "B00AEFXYJA", "0767817478", "B0034G4ORC", "B003QO8TOQ", "B00070FX5U", "B0045HCJSA", "B00000G3PA", "B005LAIHPE", "B003Y5H5GK", "B00AEBBA72", "B00003CWU3", "B00I9TDMRM", "B001ECDVKE", "B00003CXXP", "B000V4UFZK", "B0010X73ZG", "B001DZOC6Y", "B00005JKFR", "B000XT1P4S", "B003HKN52U", "B0009PW4D2", "B000HRMAPE", "B004EPYZPS", "B0018QPPXW", "B0002WZTOI", "B00AEBB9LO", "B004LWZW4M", "B003ABZHAO", "B003YJFALS", "B0087ZG7HK", "B000OT6V64", "B004P7CN7W", "B000CCBC9O", "B00000ILDD", "0767803434", "B001L57ZYM", "B000065V3G", "B007STBUHI", "B002ZG980U", "B008JFUQZ2", "B00005B6JZ", "B0006GANOQ", "B000F1IQN2", "1494343576", "B001GCUO02", "B00004Y87O", "0783226810", "B004EPYZSK", "B000P0J0BU", "B005LAIHXQ", "B001680M26", "B000EQHXN2", "B0045HCJFS", "B00004BZIY", "B00008G8M5", "B00003CXQA", "B008JFUS0U", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00EIN6KJ0", "B0000DZ6N3", "B000MV8A9A", "B00005JKYX", "B0000YEEGM", "B000TGJ8CQ", "B0013FCWUW", "B002ZG9864", "B00003CWTI", "B008MIMWQW", "B00IKM5OCO"], "bought_together": ["B00AEBB8VK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AEBB8VK", "B004LWZW4M", "B00005JL78", "B004EPYZSK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 18739}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.95, "brand": "Dreamworks Skg", "asin": "B00005JNTI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51upxzPRnXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "War of the Worlds"}
{"description": "Following in the footsteps ofThe Ringcycle, theJu-Onseries of horror films has taken Japan by the throat. According to this movie, the title refers to a curse placed upon a house where violence occurred. Sure enough, we see a string of unhappy encounters in a seemingly ordinary home, where ghosts have settled in the aftermath of murder. Director Takashi Shimizu (who also directed the Hollywood remake,The Grudge) constructs the picture out of separate fragments, not told in chronological order; the haunted house is the main character, not any one of the unsuspecting human characters.

{"description": "Literary adaptations just don't get any better than director Joe Wright's 2005 version of Jane Austen'sPride & Prejudice. The key word here isadaptation, because Wright and gifted screenwriter Deborah Moggach have taken liberties with Austen's classic novel that purists may find objectionable, but in this exquisite film their artistic decisions are entirely justified and exceptionally well executed. It's a more rural England that we see here, circa 1790 (as opposed to Austen's early 19th century), in which Elizabeth Bennet (Keira Knightley) is one of several sisters primed for marriage, with an anxious mother (Brenda Blethyn) only too desperate to see her daughters paired off with the finest, richest husbands available. Elizabeth is strong-willed and opinionated, but her head (not to mention her pride and prejudice) lead her heart astray when she meets the wealthy Mr. Darcy (Matthew Macfadyen), whose own sense of decency and discretion (not to mentionhispride and prejudice) prevent him from expressing his mutual affection. They're clearly meant for each other, and as Knightley's performance lights up the screen (still young enough to be girlishly impertinent, yet wise beyond her 20 years), Austen's timeless romance yields yet another timeless adaptation, easily on par with the belovedBBC miniseriesthat has been embraced by millions since originally broadcast in 1995. Individual tastes will vary as to which version should be considered \"definitive,\" but with a stellar supporting cast including Judi Dench and Donald Sutherland, this impeccable production achieves its own kind of perfection.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_viewed": ["0800141660", "B00003JRCQ", "B00G6HO368", "B004SIP7AS", "B004P7CNZO", "B0053Q9DHW", "B000244FDW", "B000GRUQKQ", "B000244FFU", "B0018YCF50", "B001L57ZZG", "B004XVMCMQ", "B00AF82WTO", "B008D1RCHC", "B000Z27HLS", "B000BEZQ0Y", "0767851013", "0486284735", "B0002ZH5PQ", "B0012Q3T6I", "6303921248", "B002XTBE6K", "B001PJRAUS", "B00HYMBAQ0", "B0080QOL1A", "B00062IZ0Y", "B001C4AFOY", "B0012XIGVE", "B002KHNFFS", "B000244FF0", "B0012OVCE6", "B00HYMASS6", "B0009UZGAA", "B000784WMW", "0767020308", "B000LPQ6DE", "B001TJYFRU", "B000FTCEYQ", "B000ZS8GW6", "B005GRF2UK", "B004FM2EL2", "B00G7QPXAI", "149440477X", "B009ERK0SW", "B00006ZXSK", "B0000AUHPK", "B004UOHNCA", "0767020294", "B00094AS9U", "B000Z27HMW", "B002DY9KR0", "B000N4SHOE", "B000683VI4", "193799418X"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00G6HO368", "0800141660", "B00003JRCQ", "B005S9EK5Y"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "asin": "B00005JOHI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZGC68T2JL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Pride &amp; Prejudice"}

{"description": "More exciting than The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe,The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspiancontinues the movie franchise based on C.S. Lewis' classic fantasy books. The movie picks up where the first left off... sort of. It's been a year since the Pevensie children--Peter (William Moseley), Susan (Anna Popplewell), Edmund (Skandar Keynes), and Lucy (Georgie Henley)--returned to England from Narnia, and they've just about resigned themselves to living their ordinary lives. But just like that, they're once again transported to a fantastical land, but one with a long-abandoned castle. It turns out that they are in Narnia again--and they themselves lived in that castle, but hundreds of years ago in Narnia time. They've been summoned back to help Prince Caspian (Stardust's Ben Barnes, resembling a young, cultured Keanu Reeves), the rightful heir to the throne who's become the target of his power-hungry uncle, King Mraz (Sergio Castellitto). And he's not the only one threatened: Mraz's people, the Telmarines, have pushed all the Narnians--the talking animals, the centaurs and other beasts, the walking trees--to the brink of extinction. Despite some alpha-male bickering, Peter and Caspian agree to fight Mraz alongside the remaining Narnians, including the dwarf Trumpkin (Peter Dinklage) and the swashbuckling mouse Reepicheep (voiced by Eddie Izzard). (Also appearing is Warwick Davis, who was in Willow and the 1989 BBC Prince Caspian.) But of course they most of all miss the noble lion, Aslan, who would have never let this happen to Narnia if he hadn't disappeared. Prince Caspian is epic, evoking memories of Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings films. (Some of the battle elements may seem too familiar, but they were in Lewis's book.) And it's appropriate for kids (Reepicheep could have come out of a Shrek movie), though the tone is dark and there is a lot of death, albeit bloodless. After two successful films, Disney and Walden Media's franchise has proved successful enough that many of the characters are scheduled to return in The Voyage of the Dawn Treader. --David HoriuchiStills fromThe Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian(Click for larger image)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004M1A21K", "B000E8M0VA", "B0047H7Q22", "B000LPS4J8", "B000OYCM5I", "B003ZHR6TS", "B00AEBB8KQ", "0061992887", "B00139W3NE", "B001NPD9JA", "B0016Q2D5M", "B00005JM5E", "0060598247", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B00HFFE8HE", "B004OBQDFM", "B002ZG99PY", "B000I0RQVI", "B001APZMJS", "B000U7WV1Y", "B00BEZTMFY", "B002ZG9904", "B005COPWZW", "B0011U52E2", "B00J0BTEZM", "B00AEFY9RG", "B008D1RDL2", "B0001HAISG", "B006VRRGNK", "B0013BM63O", "B00AEFYIQ8", "B00JBV4R3U", "B005LAIISA", "B001DHXT20", "B008JFUNTG", "B001HN694K", "B001QB5SS6", "B000AAF1TU", "B000GUJZ00", "B0013FSL3E", "B0012IWO0I", "B002ZG97YM", "B0000959N0", "B004AKCME8", "B000VNMMQG", "B0006GANV4", "B000Q66FB6", "B000HEWEE4", "B003HARV3Y", "B00CWM58WY", "B003L20IJM", "B002IPFWTE", "B00005JKZY", "1416995978", "B00005JG6M", "B000VBJEEG", "B001LPWGBO", "B008JFUO72", "B00128VA76", "B0009NZ2KG", "B00028HBES", "B0000640SC", "B00005JKZV", "B00003CWT6", "B00I6JOD2S", "B00JK531ES", "B004EPYZUS", "B001LXIDVS", "B004SIP75S", "B00005JN5E", "B004A8ZWUQ", "B004A8ZWW4", "B006P0FIGU", "B001NE80P4", "B00E5I2M6I", "B003ZHVJGO", "B000VWYJ86", "B002BWP49C", "B00275EHJG", "B00003CXC3", "B002ZG99KO", "B0030IIYYS", "B0006FYOTC", "B00EV1YZ96", "B00005JN4W", "B005LAIIMG", "B008JFUQ16", "B005LAIIPS", "B000BB1MI2", "B0030ZIZRC", "B0000DZ3EN", "B000W746GK", "B000UR9T8C", "B002PMV9FG", "B000BJ7BCK", "B00006ZXSK", "B001KVZ6FW", "B007R6DJP8"], "bought_together": ["B000E8M0VA", "B004M1A21K"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004M1A21K", "B000E8M0VA", "B003ZHR6TS", "0061992887"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 3310}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.68, "brand": "Walt Disney Video", "asin": "B00005JPH2", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/618uTYKkadL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian"}
{"description": "This two-disc collector's edition ofPirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chestis packed with over five hours of special features that delve into everything from creating the mythology-inspired Davy Jones and Kraken figures, to working and planning without a completed script, the incredible CGI techniques used in the film, the intense sword training sessions and stunt work, and the unpredictability of filming on location in the Caribbean. The audio commentary by writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio is an interesting and insightful look into the finished film, but perhaps even more revealing is the 25-minute \"Charting the Return\" preproduction diary in which everyone from producer Jerry Bruckheimer to associate director Peter Kohn and writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio give a sense of the enormity of the project of concurrently writing and filming two sequels toPirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl. The overwhelming logistics of planning and casting without a finished script, scouting and preparing remote locations, constructing a new Black Pearl, and functional props like the rolling water wheel, and cutting costs to stay within budget are nothing less than mind-boggling. In the hourlong \"According to Plan\" feature, director Gore Verbinski, producer Jerry Bruckheimer, and a host of others detail the enormity of the project, focusing on the stamina involved in a 200-day shooting schedule and the need for adaptability and flexibility in dealing with everything from behind schedule excavations to the logistics of shooting on moving water and even the natural fury of a full-blown hurricane.  Shorter featurettes \"Meet Davy Jones: Anatomy of a Legend\" and \"Creating the Kraken\" focus on the mythological creatures in the film and the awesome visual effects and advances in CGI technology that made them possible.  \"Mastering the Blade\" follows Orlando Bloom (Will Turner), Keira Knightley (Elizabeth Swann), and Jack Davenport (Norrington) through some intense sword-fighting training sessions and \"Fly on the Set: The Bone Cage\" offers a frightening look at what it was like to shoot the bone cage scene of the movie.  Other bonus features include bloopers, an interactive tour of Johnny Depp's special makeup effects and wardrobe details, a look at how the 1967 Disney Land Pirates of the Caribbean ride was recently \"re-imagineered\" to incorporate some of the characters and elements from the new movies, producer Jerry Bruckheimer's photo diary, and a glimpse of the glitzy June 24, 2006 red carpet premiere on Disney Land's main street.--Tami Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000U7WV1Y", "B00005JM5E", "B005COPWZW", "B004A8ZWUQ", "B0013BM63O", "B00005JN5E", "B004M1A21K", "B004DTLK80", "B000VR0570", "B00005JKZV", "B00005JKZY", "B00005JKCH", "B001HN694K", "B00005JPH2", "B00AEFYGBA", "B00BEZTMFY", "B001HQZJMU", "B00E5I2M6I", "B006VRRGNK", "B001BEK8HO", "B000E8M0VA", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B001E75QH0", "B008QE9XD2", "B00E5I2MCM", "B00LG6YEKE", "B00AEBBA72", "B007K3JFUQ", "B000HRMAPE", "B0090SI56Y", "B000E6EK2Y", "B0053FANRC", "B00005JMQW", "B008Y1YK9Y", "B00177YA1K", "B001TK80C0", "B000UR9T8C", "B00003CXI1", "B004EPYZUS", "B00003CXTA", "B001OQCV6A", "B0014Z4ON4", "B005G4TJUC", "B000F7CECK", "B00HFFE8HE", "B001GCUO1Q", "B0087ZG7J8", "B003YAR97K", "B008JFUNTG", "B001GCUO0W", "B000NIBURQ", "B0053FANPY", "B00023B1LC", "B003QO8TOQ", "B002VPE1BQ", "B00F84H73Q", "B003Y5H54W", "B00003CWT6", "B00007AJGH", "B00E5I2M9K", "B000W7F5SS", "B0049IHX2C", "B00000IRE6", "B001F7MSFM", "B000AYELVA", "B002ZG9904", "B000VWYJ86", "B00CFA222M", "B003UYUQZW", "B008UZ949K", "B0002KVUKM", "B000209KMW", "B000UVKGPI", "B0087ZG7HK", "B0000WN140", "B001EZE5BU", "B002PMV9FG", "B000HT386M", "B000NQRR1Q", "B00003CXZ1", "630529142X", "B0002ZDVEU", "B004A8ZWSS", "B00005JM5B", "B000BTITKS", "B00E5I2MEK", "B002HWRYJE", "B001GZ6QC4", "B000W796OM", "B00AQSN7HE", "B0046BI81W", "B001VLBDD0", "B0060FXDCG", "B0084IG8TM", "B005OCFGTO", "B000OLGCIE", "B008JFUS0U", "B00007AJG4", "B009JBWOU0", "B001B3LIOC"], "bought_together": ["B000U7WV1Y", "B00005JM5E"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005COPWZW", "B00005JM5E", "B0071JADFU", "B00005JPFX"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 72898}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 16.95, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B00005JP0F", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GQE7TQ72L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)"}
{"description": "At its core,Stomp the Yardis a romantic drama disguised as a dance film. Or is it the other way around? DJ (Columbus Short) is a troubled teen from Los Angeles who gets a chance for a better life when he is admitted into Atlanta's privileged Truth University. Just when he thought he had escaped a life of gangs, DJ finds himself in the middle of a \"war\" between two upper-crust fraternities where stepping (a popular dance form) is their weapon of choice. When DJ realizes the coed he falls for is the girlfriend of the school's champion stepper, he joins the rival fraternity to try to show her--and himself--that he's as good as anyone else there.Stomp the Yardis not an original film. Add some drums and you've gotDrumline. Change some of the characters around and you've gotSave the Last Dance. What sets the movie apart is the stepping. The precision involved at this level is impressively complicated and Short--a dancer and choreographer--is beautifully expressive both as an actor and a dancer. Sure the plot is predictable and hokey at times. But Short and Meagan Good (as his crush April) have wonderful chemistry together, and the supporting cast--including Harry J. Lennix as DJ's no-nonsense uncle--are delightful to watch. --Jae-Ha KimStills fromStomp the Yard(click for larger image)BeyondStomp the Yardon Amazon.comStomp the Yardon Blu-rayCD SoundtrackDance DVDs", "related": {"also_bought": ["B003SYQ7FC", "B000XSWVEC", "B0001MMGC2", "B000J3OTSM", "B000FS9ULC", "B000LRZHR8", "B00AMEZDJW", "B0012QCZ54", "B0001CNRS4", "B000YAF4Q6", "B004529NKC", "B009ANP4F4", "B00004Y2R1", "B0001FR3HW", "B00BTYPWDQ", "B00AMEZDII", "B001K2LFNI", "B000KHYN9C", "B0068FYZES", "6305505780", "B000FUTVLY", "B000BTITFI", "B000HDZKLO", "B003UEYBPI", "B004ULEF5G", "B003Y5H58S", "B000BITV9W", "B005LAIH86", "B00ANDDBBY", "B001DJLD12", "B00066FAC6", "B00004XPPD", "B00E1HIXA2", "B00AEFYAC0", "B00005JLON", "B00003CY51", "B00066FAQW", "B002DOBGWM", "B000PE0GRI", "B000WC39MM", "B00AEFXOKO", "B00EZ50RU4", "B00177YFYM", "B0034G4P1C", "B002GSXKOM", "B00000JGHV", "B000BOH8X2", "B00066FAVW", "B0014DZ2WS", "B000XT1P20", "B00000JGHO", "B00005JKE4", "0783240201", "B00003W8NT", "B00GOZ2LPM", "B0009X7BFK", "B00AMSM9AO", "B001P3SA94", "B000Q7ZNZ4", "B000LW7REE", "B003L16FCC", "B000FS9MXI", "B001K98MGE", "B00003CXMP", "B00AEFY0XE", "B00BEL4QFO", "B002CA68NO", "B0000YEE6M", "B003Y5H56K", "B00005JLQE", "0767812387", "B00005JD5J", "B00005JM10", "6305428409", "B00AEFY6TW", "B00KPYT9PS", "B00005LB86", "B0041QSZS8", "B0018RNF60", "B003QZSWU6", "B002VWNICM", "B0050OWMKW", "B0000524E5", "B004SIP93S", "B00AEFYE08", "B002E01LL6", "0780631234", "B0002B14UW", "B000NA1W3G", "B00H47IX5G", "B002VKB0LU", "B00465I1CE", "B00005JOZC", "B00005B8UA", "B001132GNY", "B0014QLEI6", "B000K4WPCC", "0783237367", "B005LAIH1S", "B00AEFYHVO"], "bought_together": ["B000J3OTSM", "B00AMEZDJW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00HZMZ272", "B000J3OTSM", "B00AMEZDJW", "B000XSWVEC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 21010}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.2, "brand": "Generic", "asin": "B00005JPK8", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51gZIdNnZcL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Stomp the Yard (Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "Edith Piaf is the subject ofLa Vie en Rose, director Olivier Dahan's powerful if emotionally redundant biographical film about the iconic French superstar whose life, as depicted here, seems to have been a numbing succession of tragedies interrupted on occasion by artistic triumph. Dahan's portrait begins with Piaf's stay in a brothel as a young girl. Left to the care of her grandmother (who runs the place) after her father pulls her away from a narcissistic mother, Piaf undergoes significant health problems and grows up to sing on the street in lieu of outright prostitution. The film pulses along with the usual biopic rhythms, with pivotal moments in the life of Piaf (played as an adult by Marion Cotillard) turning up regularly only to be smacked aside by the unseen hand of perpetual misfortune. There's the impresario (Gerard Depardieu) who recognizes Piaf's great but raw talent only to have a run-in with the criminal element around her. There's the heavyweight fighter (Marcel Cerdan) who becomes the love of Piaf's life but can't be with her. Drug addiction, random car accidents, tax problems, you name it, it's all here, topped by an unnerving revelation that pops up inLa Vie en Rose's final moments. After awhile, with such a concentration of bad news squeezed into 140 minutes, one begins to wish Dahan had taken a more expansive approach to Piaf's life and times. But the film is never less than interesting, and the lead performance by Cotillard is often astonishing.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002LE8MGW", "B004SEUIXS", "B000UVV26A", "B001CIOCLC", "B000002UYD", "B002VKB0M4", "B000YPUFBA", "B002AG2NTI", "B0007Z0NYQ", "B0087IT8FK", "B000MEYIBG", "B0009P7EI2", "B004WDZR0O", "B00279MJHE", "0307268012", "B0069UV0AY", "B001THZAAI", "B005MYEQ4U", "B000002TMF", "B000LXH10I", "B00421IR5I", "B0000C9JFO", "B007I1Q59E", "B00AZNEVNE", "B000I6BJ56", "B000811672", "B00007J5VT", "B008H1Q3QY", "B0002S64SM", "B003L20III", "B00782O7IY", "1613743920", "B005V4X8PO", "B0007A61K6", "B0030MD5TS", "B0019UGYAU", "B0000YEENU", "B0084O26SI", "B004B3254Q", "B0001Y4JO8", "B004ZBFRRG", "B006KDHJMS", "B00A92MEJY", "B000UAE7MM", "B009CSVQ8Q", "B000SAAT76", "B00008979K", "B000CSUNRU", "B000YAA68W", "B004SIP6BI", "B0041KKYF6", "B002QQ8HAG", "B00005JM48", "B00007L4I6", "B000934FC2", "B005CKW8BM", "B004YCKKIM", "B002ONC9NC", "B001AZJKKK", "B0012EI8ES", "B009B8YMB0", "B000053VBN", "B0002V7TI8", "B004UXUUDA", "B008CJ0JS4", "B001DZA3W6", "B0031REQKE", "B000LXHK2C", "B005HISOJ4", "B000B58DHQ", "B000296E7W", "0792833279", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B005CU5OF4", "B0000A1HQP", "B00ENMZK1A", "B00166UFTS", "B000053VBP", "B00CDV4PPK", "B00005AUK9", "B004XVMCMG", "B00005NC66", "B00008G7UF", "B0031SU2Y2", "B00000AVEO", "B000M06KJ8", "B00ANQHR7U", "B004NWPY3E", "B001C71IEM", "B006OB3JVQ", "B00G15MDI0", "B001KVZ6AM", "B0036TGSJE", "B001O549EI", "B0045NXMJE", "B000SSQ7JC", "B004ZG5EYC", "B00000K3TS"], "bought_together": ["B002LE8MGW", "B001CIOCLC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005MYEQ4U", "B002LE8MGW", "B004SEUIXS", "B000UVV26A"]}, "price": 11.14, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 9014}, "asin": "B00005JPX8", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ylggkac7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "La Vie en Rose (Extended Version)"}
{"description": "One of the first things a viewer notices aboutCloverfieldis that it doesn't play by ordinary storytelling rules, making this intriguing horror film as much a novelty as an event. Told from the vertiginous point-of-view of a camcorder-wielding group of friends,Cloverfieldbegins like a primetime television soap opera about young Manhattanites coping with changes in their personal lives. Rob (Michael Stahl-David) is leaving New York to take an executive job at a company in Japan. At his goodbye party in a crowded loft, Rob&#x92;s brother Jason (Mike Vogel) hands a camcorder to best friend Hud (T.J. Miller), who proceeds to tape the proceedings over old footage of Rob&#x92;s ex-girlfriend, Beth (Odette Yustman)--images shot during happy times in that now-defunct relationship. Naturally, Beth shows up at the party with a new beau, bumming Rob out completely. Just before one's eyes glaze over from all this heartbreaking stuff (captured by Hud, who's something of a doofus, in laughably shaky camerawork), the unexpected happens: New York is suddenly under attack from a Godzilla-like monster stomping through midtown and destroying everything and everybody in sight. Rob and company hit the streets, but rather than run with other evacuees, they head toward the center of the storm so that Rob can rescue an injured Beth. There are casualties along the way, but the journey into fear is fascinating and immediate if emotionally remote--a consequence of seeing these proceedings through the singular, subjective perspective of a camcorder and of a story that intentionally leaves major questions unanswered: Who or what is this monster? Where did it come from? The lack of a backstory, and spare views of the marauding creature, are clever ways by producer J.J.

{"description": "You know you're going to get a different kind of superhero when you cast Robert Downey Jr. in the lead role. AndIron Manis different, in welcome ways. Cleverly updated from Marvel Comics' longstanding series,Iron Manputs billionaire industrialist Tony Stark (that's Downey) in the path of some Middle Eastern terrorists; in a brilliantly paced section, Stark invents an indestructible suit that allows him to escape. If the rest of the movie never quite hits that precise rhythm again, it nevertheless offers plenty of pleasure, as the renewed Stark swears off his past as a weapons manufacturer, develops his new Iron Man suit, and puzzles both his business partner (Jeff Bridges in great form) and executive assistant (Gwyneth Paltrow). Director Jon Favreau geeks out in fun ways with the hardware, but never lets it overpower the movie, and there's always a goofy one-liner or a slapstick pratfall around to break the tension. As for Downey, he doesn't get to jitterbug around too much in his improv way, but he brings enough of his unpredictable personality to keep the thing fresh. And listen up, hardcore Marvel mavens: even if you know the Stan Lee cameo is coming, you won't be able to guess it until it's on the screen. It all builds to a splendid final scene, with a concluding line delivery by Downey that just feels absolutely right.--Robert HortonStills fromIron Man(Click for larger image)&nbsp;", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00E5I2M6I", "B008JFUO72", "B001DHXT20", "B00E5I2M9K", "B00E5I2MEK", "B0083SBMBM", "B008JFUS0U", "B001CDR1FG", "B00E5I2MAO", "B004LWZWFQ", "B001GCUO1Q", "B008JFUPFI", "B000VI70QS", "B000HEVZ9E", "B0000959N0", "B00005JKCH", "B00005JNJV", "B00005JNTU", "B0090SI56Y", "B000VR0570", "B00005JMQW", "B002HWRYJE", "B0007P0Y7C", "B004LWZW42", "B00D7OMNXS", "B001OQCV6A", "B007K3JFUQ", "B004EPZ07K", "B004LWZWGA", "B000UR9T8C", "B0083SBJXS", "B0060FXDCG", "B002IPFWTE", "B00E5I2ME0", "B00IXD2MGQ", "B000AYELVA", "B00C6B8TB8", "B008QZ5PY2", "B000OVLBF8", "B000AYELVU", "B00AZMFJYA", "B001QB9H1U", "B009JBWOU0", "B001AK3S4Y", "B001GZ6QC4", "B005G4TJUC", "B002NXSRVG", "B000HCO83Q", "B003YOZNBU", "B003Q6D2B4", "B00023B1LC", "B0002IQMAM", "B008JFURII", "B00HERGM86", "B00E5I2MDQ", "B006VRRGNK", "B002ZG99QS", "B00000JQB5", "B007REV4T8", "B00008G8M5", "B008Y1YK9Y", "B0002ZDVEU", "6305718954", "B001DTPZNY", "B005LAIGW8", "B001F7MSFM", "B001GCUNWQ", "B00A2H9P98", "B000RW3VDE", "B002O5M4T4", "B00005JA8B", "B005LAIIPS", "B005LAII44", "B00BEIYHO2", "B000GUJZ00", "B00005N5S5", "B002SJIO4A", "B000VWYJ86", "B004EPZ0BG", "B0049IHX2C", "B00AEBBAEK", "B00005JM5E", "B008JFUOWM", "B000FS9FCG", "B00005PJ6N", "B00979KQFO", "B00AEFXKUI", "B002K0WBXW", "B0042U94UQ", "B004EPYZUS", "B008JFUQZ2", "B0084IG8TM", "B001DJLD1M", "B008JFUS5A", "B00006HBUJ", "B000J103OI", "B00F84H73Q", "B0087ZG7NO", "B000U1ZV8K"], "bought_together": ["B00E5I2M6I", "B008JFUO72"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B008JFUO72", "B00E5I2M6I", "B001DHXT20", "B00E5I2MEK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 12121}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.99, "brand": "DOWNEY,ROBERT JR.", "asin": "B00005JPS8", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515wjJQt2nL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Iron Man (Ultimate 2 Disc Edition)"}
{"description": "Here's hoping James Mangold's big, raucous, and ultrabloody remake of3:10 to Yumaleads some moviegoers to check outDelmer Daves's beautifully lean, half-century-old original. That classic Western spun a tale of captured outlaw Ben Wade (Glenn Ford)--deadly but disarmingly affable--and the small-time rancher and family man, Dan Evans (Van Heflin), desperate enough to accept the job of helping escort the badman to Yuma prison. Wade, knowing that his gang will be along at any moment to spring him, works at persuading the ultimately lone deputy to accept a bribe, turn his back on \"duty,\" and go home safe and rich to his family. That the outlaw has come to admire his captor intriguingly complicates the suspense.All of the above applies in the new3:10, but it takes a lot more huffing and puffing to get Wade (Russell Crowe this time) and Evans (Christian Bale) into position for the showdown. Mostly, more is less. To Mangold's credit, his movie doesn't traffic in facile irony or postmodern detachment; it aims to be a straight-up Western and deliver the excitement and charisma the genre's fans are starved for. But recognizing that contemporary viewers might be out of touch with the bedrock simplicity and strength of the genre--not to mention its code of honor--Mangold has supplied both Evans and Wade with a plethora of backstory and \"motivations.\" At the overblown action climax, the crossfire of personal agendas is almost as frenetic as the copious gunplay. (By that point the movie has killed more people than the Lincoln County War.)Best thing about the remake is Russell Crowe's Ben Wade, a Scripture-quoting career villain with an artist's eye and a curiously principled sense of whom and when to murder. As his second-in-command, Ben Foster fairly pirouettes at every opportunity to commit mayhem, and Peter Fonda contributes a fierce portrait of an old Wade adversary turned bounty hunter for the Pinkerton detective agency.--Richard T.

{"description": "For anyone who thought the Oscar-winning documentaryMarch of the Penguinswas the most marvelous cinematic moment for these nomads of the south, you haven't seen nothing yet.Happy Feetis an animated wonder about a penguin named Mumble who can't sing, but can dance up a storm. George Miller, the driving force behind theBabe(andMad Max) movies, takes another creative step in family entertainment with this big, beautiful, music-fueled film that will have kids and their parents dancing in the streets. From his first moment alive, Mumble (voiced Elijah Woods) feels the beat and can't stop dancing. Unfortunately, emperor penguins are all about finding their own heart song, and the dancing youngster--as cute as he is--is a misfit. Luckily, he bumps into little blue penguins and a Spanish-infused group (led by Robin Williams) and begins a series of adventures. Miller has an exceptional variety of entertainment: Busby Berkley musical numbers, amusement-park thrills, exciting chase sequences (seals and orca lovers might like think otherwise), and even an environmental message that doesn't weigh you down. Best of all, you don't know where the movie is going in the last act, a rare occurrence these days in family entertainment. A fusion of rock songs, mashed-up and otherwise, are featured; this movie is as much a musical as a comedy. Mumble's solo dance to a new version of Stevie Wonder's \"I Wish\" by Fantasia, Patti, and Yolanda may be the most joyful moment on camera in 2006.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0006UEVT0", "B001DPHDCY", "B0006JMLRK", "B0012EM5D8", "B004HO6I4M", "B004EPZ0AC", "B002WJI2QQ", "B000AY74OG", "B0000AOX0O", "B00BG0RSJ4", "B00005JNQS", "B000RMJ4F8", "B0000640SC", "B005SDUV4E", "0783231474", "B00003CXJ4", "B00CWM58WY", "B0000VV4W2", "B0042U94UQ", "B0039N74CW", "6305161887", "B00AEFXMSS", "B000M343BC", "B00007LVCM", "B001ECQ75A", "B00005JNS0", "B00000JL8E", "B000GUJZ00", "B000056H26", "B008NNY9QW", "B004EPZ034", "B00G5G7EXY", "B000LPS2VI", "B005LAIH4A", "B00F522C7C", "B005LAIISA", "B00GDT5T9Y", "B007FF3HQM", "B000VBJEEG", "B003H9M1Q2", "B00029LO0Y", "B008JFUQ16", "B00005JMQZ", "B00EV1YZ96", "B000ION23A", "B0013FSL3E", "B003ZHVJGO", "B002ZG97YM", "B001NCDFTW", "B004G600A4", "B00009YXAW", "B005LAIHW2", "B00AFEX83C", "B00475B0H6", "B000UVKGPI", "B00ALMNCLQ", "B00HLTD2OE", "B00005JM7T", "B001HN6922", "B000BI5KV0", "B0013FSWT2", "B0030IIZ4M", "B004ODLUGM", "B001GCUO7A", "B005F96UJ6", "B000UFIYOO", "B000G75AZC", "B00005QFE1", "B0000VCZKW", "B00IEXX4KS", "B001THIQFO", "B000A2WAQK", "B001GCUNWQ", "B00B7EQPNE", "B002NZK5SW", "B0007PIDBQ", "B00AOCDDGC", "B000V5IP6U", "B0044RFTD8", "B00AEFXMGU", "B001KVZ6FW", "B00CHVJODE", "B000CZ0PT4", "B006JD48LO", "B0007Z0NYG", "B00EBBGLFC", "B00003CXB4", "B000BMGEJI", "B008YWY0HK", "B0002YLCOM", "B00E9ZATJO", "B004A8ZX3C", "B00I6JOD2S", "B005G3VCYY", "B00CQRN3QI", "B004OWQTZ0", "B0001OGUQI", "B004EPZ01G", "B00005JMFH", "B000GIXEWC"], "bought_together": ["B004HO6I4M"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004HO6I4M", "B00EBBGLFC", "B00G5G7EXY", "B00HR3D56O"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 21763}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.51, "brand": "Warner", "asin": "B00005JPCF", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51sX2Hrdz6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Happy Feet (Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "The Dark Knightarrives with tremendous hype (best superhero movie ever? posthumous Oscar for Heath Ledger?), and incredibly, it lives up to all of it.  But calling it the best superhero movie ever seems like faint praise, since part of what makes the movie great--in addition to pitch-perfect casting, outstanding writing, and a compelling vision--is that it bypasses the normal fantasy element of the superhero genre and makes it all terrifyingly real.  Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) is Gotham City's new district attorney, charged with cleaning up the crime rings that have paralyzed the city. He enters an uneasy alliance with the young police lieutenant, Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman), and Batman (Christian Bale), the caped vigilante who seems to trust only Gordon--and whom only Gordon seems to trust. They make progress until a psychotic and deadly new player enters the game: the Joker (Heath Ledger), who offers the crime bosses a solution--kill the Batman. Further complicating matters is that Dent is now dating Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal, after Katie Holmes turned down the chance to reprise her role), the longtime love of Batman's alter ego, Bruce Wayne.In his last completed role before his tragic death, Ledger is fantastic as the Joker, a volcanic, truly frightening force of evil. And he sets the tone of the movie: the world is a dark, dangerous place where there are no easy choices.  Eckhart and Oldman also shine, but as good as Bale is, his character turns out rather bland in comparison (not uncommon for heroes facing more colorful villains). Director-cowriter Christopher Nolan (Memento) follows his critically acclaimedBatman Beginswith an even better sequel that sets itself apart from notable superhero movies likeSpider-Man 2andIron Manbecause of its sheer emotional impact and striking sense of realism--there are no suspension-of-disbelief superpowers here. At 152 minutes, it's a shade too long, and it's much too intense for kids. But for most movie fans--and not just superhero fans--The Dark Knightis a film for the ages.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B00DUCXFUC", "B004LWZWGK", "B000PC6A3E", "B002ZG981E", "B00G4RD4PQ", "B0039208QM", "B001GMALGY", "B00E2Y0YBK", "B00C2IGQBA", "B0039208JE", "B00H14WTLQ", "B0039208CG", "B0085D3I3K", "B0039208C6", "B000M5AJQI", "B00319ECGK", "B001FB55H6", "B00EIG5M5A", "7020070078", "B00E2Y6AUY", "B00D5FMGGS", "B001OQCV6K", "B0013FBS20", "B000Q6GX5Y", "B001GKJ2FC", "B00FPS79F6", "B001992NUQ", "B004JMSIRC", "B001RIY4WE", "B00DYEN6XC", "B008QZ5PY2", "B001F7MSG6", "B00FAHYNWE", "B00J7PRJXU", "B001AQT0Z4", "B001UV4XEW", "B0083SBJXS", "B00AEFY552", "B00C8RD79O", "B007KAJG3K", "B007L4HET8", "B004EPZ07U", "B007L4HFDI", "B00AEFXKOO", "B000PC0U1W", "B00C6B8TB8", "B00HINFI4K", "B003TT2X6I", "B001KZIRM2", "B002ZG99NG", "B00EZ4M68G", "B004SIP90G", "B003ZHR6RK", "B001GCUO16", "B003TT2X6S", "B00JNEWSLS", "B001F3FUK6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00DUCXFUC", "B004LWZWGK", "B002ZG981E", "B000PC6A3E"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "asin": "B00005JPY0", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51pGxSkkz4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Dark Knight [Theatrical Release]"}

{"description": "In season four,The X-Filescontinued to expand the  breadth and complexity of the mythology established in the previous two  seasons while developing a deeper, romantically ambiguous relationship  between its photogenic leads, FBI Special Agents Fox Mulder (David  Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson). New players such as  United Nations official Marita Covarrubias and virus-carrying bees  joined familiar faces like Cigarette Smoking Man, Alex Krycek, the  blockheaded Alien Bounty Hunters, and the Consortium in the growing  cast of a global struggle involving multiple factions of alien forces.  It was a season in which Mulder and Scully seemed to lose ground to the  global forces surrounding them, in which Mulder was infected with the  black oil and Scully discovered she had cancer. With even the loyalties  of Assistant Director Skinner and Mulder's mother in doubt, Mulder and  Scully learned to trust only each other in their pursuit of the  truth.The show also continued to take breaks from the dizzying, heavy  mythology to serve up standalone episodes with the show's unusual blend  of sophisticated humor and creepy paranormal explorations. In \"Musings  of a Cigarette Smoking Man,\" the show parodied the scope of the  public's conspiracy paranoia, implying that Cigarette Smoking Man was  involved in everything from JFK's assassination to the Buffalo Bills'  four straight losses in the Super Bowl. The three previous seasons had  not exhausted the list of popular paranormal phenomena to tackle, and  season four covered a wide range of topics from invisibility  (\"Unrequited\"), past lives (\"The Field Where I Died\"), and inbreeding  (\"Home\") to shape-shifting (\"Small Potatoes\") and golems (\"Kaddish\").The X-Filesproved, again, to be that rare science-fiction show  that could both frighten and touch its audience, telling intelligent  stories that resonated with the skeptic in each of us, all the while  sprinkling in a few laughs.--Eugene Wei", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000CNE0T2", "B000BOH990", "B000CNE0TC", "B000EXDS34", "B000BOH98G", "B000EXDS3E", "B000EXDS3Y", "B000BOH986", "B0007X7044", "B001G7PSZI", "B001FACH7S", "B0006UEVUE", "B001CY5N00", "B003V1IU3O", "B001G7PT4I", "0061686174", "B000244E2O", "B00465I156", "B00133QNSG", "0061053309", "B0002NY8R6", "1933784725", "B00005JA9M", "B00FXW9664", "B0009X76XW", "B000SULWKO", "B000FFJYC0", "B000E1MXWS", "B000NOKFH6", "B001G0MFIS", "B001A9ZRLC", "B001DPHDBU", "B000063V8R", "B00005Y1NF", "B00KHA9BQ2", "B000667HBS", "B00FWMVVI6", "B00FWMVVHC", "B000R7I44K", "B003K2G0TA", "B004TPJMRY", "B0001AVZDU", "B000ATQYWY", "B000A88EU0", "B0038M2AWI", "B002VA5A02", "B001CQONKY", "B0081QF6Q8", "B00008KA59", "B00GX7D5JW", "B001992NWO", "B003L77H1E", "B000FOPPBA", "B000U1ZV1W", "B000CQM4YM", "B00JJ3EHCG", "B00BTFK01Y", "B000UX6TIE", "B00IWTVDUW", "B000B8I9ZO", "B00FWMVVKY", "B002BAW6GS", "B003R0MF1W", "B000F8O2PQ", "B001VPJYZ0", "B00AJXO4FA", "B003BE2KBO", "B0018CWEYY", "B000FIMG68", "B0085KGGTQ", "B00HUPC5X8", "B008LCRA98", "B003L77GWE", "B00JF5GAZA", "B002WC89WK", "B0007CNY4K", "B00IQ8TT82", "B00080ZG2E", "B000XJD3K2", "B0002DB5N6", "B0019LY5IM", "B000I0QLR8", "B003TNW030", "B000H7JCGY", "B006BZ8NSE", "B00BM2JVAA", "B0006UEVTK", "B0002WZTCA", "B000A6CLKQ", "B000KGH00W", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B00IYMSMTM", "B0002NY8GW", "B00J5JSV1W", "B00005JNOG", "B00CRX82LM", "B00K0MM4AM", "B000X5SPBI", "B000OHBCI8", "B000ICLRKC"], "bought_together": ["B000BOH990", "B000CNE0T2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000BOH990", "B000BOH986", "B000BOH98G", "B000CNE0T2"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 200096}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 66.47, "brand": "", "asin": "B00005NC6H", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51PSBVDYPVL._SX300_.jpg", "title": "The X-Files - The Complete Fourth Season"}

{"description": "Filmed in the late summer of 1999,Cheap Trick: Silveris a 25th  anniversary celebration of the Rockford, Illinois, band famous for marrying  British Invasion-era pop hooks with the guitar crunch of the Who'sQuadropheniaperiod. Shot on a sealed-off, Rockford street, the concert  is an electrifying overview of high points from the group'sdiscography. The songs  plucked from each of their albums reveal a remarkable power-pop consistency  over the long haul, despite the band's lengthy periods of commercial  rejection and bare survival. Visibly thrilled, Cheap Trick soar here through  monster hits (\"I Want You to Want Me,\" \"Dream Police\") and milk every drop of  emotion from masterful ballads (\"I Can't Take It\"). While stellar guests  include Slash and Billy Corgan, it's the appearances by less famous folk (the  Rockford Symphony Orchestra, a few offspring of guitarist Rick Nielsen and  singer Robin Zander) that movingly underscore the populist glories of this  American band.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002G1WPGS", "B00278FSTG", "B003MX5ORG", "B000062XFM", "B00009V7TJ", "B00028HBSE", "6305458162", "B000002ADX", "B000008MLM", "B00005A0BD", "B003GNF20G", "B002BH4EZM", "B00001ODGR", "B000FILW86", "B000006M9T", "B00005QBZD", "B0015RCUTG", "B002G1WPGI", "B00004YC1W", "B0001FGBH0", "B00000ILG6", "B0012GMX9W", "B007REABAG", "B001FA30V0", "B0000062FR", "B0012GMV2Q", "B0029W2V86", "B000286S9C", "B007OCD1MQ", "B00F8KIJ2I", "B00JKJ101K", "B0012GMVSA", "B0053TWVFA", "B0007QJ1ES", "B003O5MOCA", "B00000271W", "B00009WKXH", "B000059TOW", "B004IZJL30", "0793544580", "B005S0NVJE", "B0000028Y0", "B0000025R8", "B002VFQT3O", "B001SNXHNK", "B000H5VADY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00278FSTG", "B0012GMVSA", "B003MX5ORG", "B002G1WPGS"]}, "price": 17.52, "categories": [["CDs & Vinyl", "Classic Rock", "Arena Rock"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Metal"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Pop", "Vocal Pop"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Rock", "Power Pop"], ["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 227038}, "asin": "B00005OCLC", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41SGG6R7MHL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Cheap Trick - Silver"}

{"description": "Danis Tanovic's Academy Award&reg;-winning satire of the war in the Balkans is an astounding balancing act, an acidic black comedy grounded in the brutality and horror of war. Stuck in an abandoned trench between enemy lines, a Serb and a Bosnian play the blame game in a comic tit-for-tat struggle while a wounded Bosnian soldier lies helplessly on a land mine. A French tank unit of the U.N.'s humanitarian force (known locally as \"the Smurfs\"), a scheming British TV reporter, a German mine defuser, and the U.N. high command (led by a bombastically ineffectual Simon Callow) all become tangled in the chaotic rescue as the tenuous cease-fire is only a spark away from detonation. Tanovic directs with a ferocious, angry eloquence and makes his points with vivid metaphors and a savage humor as harrowing as it is hilarious.

{"description": "This movie follows the unwritten law of sequels: bring back the same characters and put them in similar jeopardy with slightly tweaked circumstances. Instead of a cross-country journey, this time the pet trio must get from the San Francisco airport across the Golden Gate Bridge to their suburban home. Michael J. Fox and Sally Field return as the voices of Chance the bulldog and Sassy the cat, with Ralph Waite replacing the late Don Ameche as the elderly golden retriever. Their journey features dogfights, house fires, an epic battle with a pair of petnappers, and a love affair for Chance with a stray from the other side of the bridge (Carla Gugino). Sinbad voices another dog who guides them through the mean streets of the city by the bay, and Robert Hays stars as the father, but, frankly, that hardly matters. What does is the animals' banter, and they're funny.

{"description": "As the sixth season ofStar Trek: The Next Generationwent into production, everyone knew that attentions would soon be permanently divided by the debut ofDeep Space Nine. Sure enough, that meant crossovers (\"Birthright\"), guest stars, and references back and forth. The sense of baton-passing drew theTNGfamily closer, however. Directorial debuts begun in season 5 allowed for repeat group-huddle ownership of several shows. Jonathan Frakes bettered \"The Quality of Life\" by \"The Chase,\" which finally offered an explanation why most races in theTrekuniverse are humanoid with knobbly foreheads. Patrick Stewart crowbarred a Western into the franchise in \"A Fistful of Datas.\" LeVar Burton introduced the far more exciting Riker clone Thomas in \"Second Chances.\" But here we still find an inability to follow through a good idea, since it was intended for the clone Tom to replace the real Will. Barclay outstayed his welcome with a lackluster \"Ship in a Bottle\" (despite a hammy cameo from Stephanie Beacham) after he'd injected creepiness into \"Realm of Fear.\" The same happened with Q and the painfully weak \"True Q\" contrasted by the philosophically challenging \"Tapestry,\" in which Picard faced the decisions of his youth.Yet ultimately the year provided more memorable moments than either year 5 did or year 7 would. There was the fun of a pint-sized Starfleet in \"Rascals,\" the shocking comment on political torture in \"Chain of Command,\" the endlessMatrix-like guessing game of reality in \"Frame of Mind,\" and even a jokey genre nod often called \"Die Hard Picard\" instead of its official title, \"Starship Mine.\" The two biggest attention-drawing moments came via stellar cameos. There was the bittersweet sight of James Doohan revisiting the originalEnterprisebridge on \"Relics,\" then a quick contribution by Stephen Hawking in the cliffhanger \"Descent.\" Both were attempts at keepingTNGthe connoisseur'sTrekincarnation of choice.--Paul Tonks", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00BHWG0CM", "B000063V8T", "B000063V8S", "B000063V8R", "B000062XFG", "B00005Y1NF", "B00BHWG0G8", "B00BHWG1AI", "B00005JLF5", "B00008972H", "B000127LW2", "B00062IDLA", "B0001NBNFW", "B00062IDCO", "B0002WZTCA", "B0002JP4GE", "B00008KA5A", "B00008KA58", "B000AOEMXC", "B000228EBS", "B00062RCC6", "B00008KGT0", "B0009I7NGW", "B00008KA59", "B00062IDDS", "B00008KA57", "B0007TKH66", "B002I9Z8GM", "B000A6CLL0", "B001DHXT3Y", "B001DHXT6G", "B000AOEMXM", "6305181721", "B000HEWEJ4", "B0000AUHOH", "B0095XPZBC", "B00CKYHH6O", "B0083TUEHY", "B00IWTVDUW", "B00ENFS0F0", "B002I9Z8GW", "B00B7VZN76", "B002I9Z8I0", "B0017VG69U", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B00AZMFJYA", "B000HWZ4E8", "B0019N95IK", "B00404ME2E", "B00JL6L4UY", "B00005JLRT", "B000EU1Q3Q", "B000BOH98G", "B00BTJV9RO", "B000VDDDY6", "B00008GEK4", "B00GX7D5JW", "B000JGWD50", "B00GTZWZH6", "B000BOH986", "B00CLA3Y2I", "B000BOH990", "B0096RC57O", "B0007ZSHR6", "B002HQKRBC", "B00B5ARKC0", "B000BW7QWW", "B003AWRM9W", "B001LF347E", "B002L9N4E2", "B000A7PKGW", "B000CNE0T2", "B00C7A8WNS", "B00198X0YA", "B00JJRLFTU", "145169590X", "B004TJ1H3C", "B000BC8T1E", "B000EXDS34", "B001A7GOCA", "B00BAXTY8U", "B00CYQXHLC", "B009RNK0YC", "B00BEZTMFY", "B000SAGGL4", "B000CNE0SS", "B005ZVIMUE", "B000A9QK7I", "B00FFEM0W2", "B0000VCZK2", "B0000AQS0F", "B001S86IZE", "B0071HPOHY", "B0002W4SY0", "B00E8AVN9U", "B00096S47G", "B0006UEVTA", "B008IG0F7G", "B006W95BWA", "B00D9EJFZA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000063V8T", "B000063V8S", "B00005Y1NF", "B000063V8R"]}, "price": 1.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 75917}, "asin": "B000063V8U", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51d6CrUx7kL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Star Trek The Next Generation - The Complete Sixth Season"}
{"description": "Retelling a story that has made it onto the silver screen more than most, this latest adaptation of The Count of Monte Cristo makes yet another swashbuckling attempt to win over a new generation of cinema goers. A dashing James Caviezel takes the role of the Count, who is driven by a desire for revenge after being betrayed by his best friend Fernand (played by a dishevelled Guy Pearce) and landed with 16 years of solitary confinement in Chateau D'If, a damp cavernous prison. Thus the scene is set for a good old-fashioned romp. The trouble with this \"re-imagining\" (to borrow a phrase from Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes) is that it's never quite sure whether to take itself seriously or not. Alexandre Dumas's original story is a traditionally melodramatic tale of deceit and double-crossing, with clear-cut bad guys and a moral lesson to be learned at the end. Here, director Kevin Reynolds appears unsure about whether to stick with tradition or bring the story up to date and turn it into a post-modern play on the old Victorian values and style. When the Count and his heavy-breathing loved one are reunited, their kiss is actually framed as a cameo. Both lead actors are also prone to heavy bouts of overacting, garnishing their performances with exaggerated baroque gestures. Clearly this is a film in which the actors could over-indulge themselves and (almost) get away with it, were it not for the fact that--bar Richard Harris as the \"Priest\"--none of them seem to have the faintest idea about how to conduct themselves in a period drama. This Count of Monte Cristo will leave the audience a little confused as to whether they should cry along with the story or laugh along with the actors. --Nikki Disney On the DVD: The Count of Monte Cristo on disc offers no escape from the dry drawl of director Kevin Reynolds, who features in almost every element of the extensive extras package.

In this case it's Frankie Muniz from TV'sMalcolm in the Middle, playing a Michigan eighth-grader whose penchant for lying results in parental scorn when he claims that a Hollywood movie mogul (ace character actor Paul Giamatti) has stolen the kid's hastily written English essay and turned it into his upcoming summer blockbuster. The kid only wants to prove his honesty and recruits his girlfriend (spunky TV star Amanda Bynes) to beat the honcho on his Hollywood turf. Elaborate practical jokes and slapstick gags turn this kid stuff (scripted and produced by two former child stars) into an enjoyable send-up of Hollywood absurdity. When combined with Giamatti's mastery of slow-burning megalomania, the show-biz in-jokes andHome Alone-style anarchy make this a harmless diversion for the young and young-at-heart.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00009QG6G", "B0000639HQ", "B00022FWTA", "B00005JKZM", "B002GOAH1U", "B000MEYJHE", "B0000CABC8", "B00005JN0D", "B000UNYK4E", "B0007US7CG", "B000SAGGQY", "6306010513", "B00005JM9Q", "B000P0J0CO", "B001GC9VK6", "B001DB6J7S", "B00AEBB8R4", "B003L20IHE", "6305870179", "B0010X5X4O", "B0000YTPO8", "B000FS9MXI", "B000BJ7BCK", "B0000DZTN8", "B00005JN0Z", "B0007US7C6", "B0007LXPBS", "B0006J28MI", "B0017TWV0U", "B00005JM4W", "B0007LXPBI", "B00005JMCW", "B00006FDAI", "B0009DWL8W", "B00005V9I9", "B000065V42", "B0074FUROI", "B000J4QW7W", "B000H5V8CW", "B000324Y98", "B00009XUM5", "B00E1HIX66", "B000209KMW", "B001ON57MS", "B0009JE57G", "B004HYK25I", "B0006SSMWE", "B000FCW15A", "B004SIPAFK", "B001SXZ7TW", "B001JJMGIU", "B000LMPDXQ", "B001FB55MG", "B000YGGNMO", "B000WC39MM", "B00006SFL7", "B00005JMXO", "B002GHHHOC", "0783235070", "B00008K7AM", "B000RBA6C4", "B0013ND3MK", "B004SIPA9Q", "B000068QPM", "B000JMK6OO", "B000089771", "B000J10FLY", "B00AMEZDGU", "B004SIPADM", "B00005JKVU", "1558908404", "B000089773", "B00000K3UU", "B00008AOVI", "B001R3YRIU", "B000B8QFXM", "B000ZBEOEC", "B00005JOWW", "B000Y9PC7S", "B000089778", "B00AEFYZCU", "B006JTS6XY", "B000803BQC", "B000640WHG", "B0036TGSIK", "B00AEFYO08", "B000051S54", "B00063KGPU", "B003B1X85O", "B000IZJZIU", "B000BFH2C8", "B000056T4I", "6304711867", "B00175VSBW", "B004QIG7CW", "B00AEFY8FO", "B00005JOZC", "B000OLGCIE", "B004WJT5E2"], "bought_together": ["B0000639HQ", "B00009QG6G"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000N4RARO", "B000UNYK4E", "B00009QG6G", "B004HYK25I"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 4701}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.69, "brand": "Universal Studios", "asin": "B000069HZN", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51S2S4B5EQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Big Fat Liar"}

{"description": "What do you get when you cross the director ofI Know What You Did Last Summerwith Sylvester Stallone? You get a slasher film in which the victims are not screaming, scantily clad teens, but parka-clad cops. Whether that's an improvement on the genre is open for debate. WithEye See You(which never hit U.S. theaters but was released internationally asD-Tox), Stallone's career has officially \"Van-Dammed.\" But the role of FBI special agent Jake Malloy is something of a dramatic departure. Unable to catch a cop killer before he nastily dispatches his girlfriend (wouldn't you know; right before Jake was about to propose!), Jake takes to the bottle. He enters a snowbound rehab center for cops housed in the Wyoming mountains. The demons Jake must confront are not just psychological. A killer is stalking the residents one by one. Shallow characterizations and ham-fisted dialogue are good for armchair heckling, but for Stallone fans, this will be of interest as even more of a career curiosity thanStop! Or My Mom Will Shoot.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000056PNL", "B000MEYKEG", "B00008UALG", "0783226934", "B0001FGBWK", "B0045HCJ5S", "B004SIP6WW", "B0000VV5BM", "B00DYXCHN8", "B0045HCJG2", "B0006IIPL2", "1558908846", "6304602944", "B00004STDN", "B00003CXTM", "B00H1RMWYW", "B000BMY2N8", "B000U1ZV62", "6304779631", "B0045HCJGC", "B00AEFY6PQ", "B00D3LA6RK", "B002TVQ4CG", "B0010YVCB6", "B00005JKIP", "B002GHHHH4", "B001FWRYYC", "B002UZCJ8Y", "B000P0I4O4", "B002H6NVM4", "B00DZP1C2W", "B00BX8PG4S", "B00HZMZ2FE", "B000056PMU", "B0006JGIQU", "B003KV3E2M", "B0009YA3OA", "B008E70EES", "6305767866", "B00CX7TOOG", "B0034G4OUO", "B00HGBAG46", "B00005JLO8", "B000QUCRB4", "B0006GAOGS", "B0002J4X2K", "B0002S94CK", "B00IKM5LXG", "B00F3TDA6O", "B00015YVDG", "B00DU22OI6", "B00BLF9FOK", "B0045HCIXG", "B0002O7XTU", "B007ZR04AW", "B00AIBZMD6", "0790732149", "B005S9EJVY", "B00D3LA6M0", "B004XVMCN0", "B000G1ALDY", "B001QOGYFO", "078401132X", "B00HWWUR02", "B00HRUQ7WG", "B000RJO56E", "B0006GAOG8", "B0002J58HO", "B00153ZR8G", "B00HODLW6C", "B00008979E", "B00069L0Y0", "B00HEPC0TS", "B005DCJ2RW", "B00A4TMLNG", "B006QWC2ZC", "B001O7JHVG", "B004ULNJIU", "B002ZG999U", "B0058ZPNBI", "B0001Z37HM", "B009WGYXIS", "B0015XHP2C", "B00003CXSP", "B00083FZEU", "B0007KIFGE", "B004W48KHK", "B0004Z33G4", "B000U1ZV8K", "B00B96TGQS", "6304698747", "B007IUEEA2", "B009AMAJPA", "B0087OULG4", "6304806434", "B00B6OEB18", "B002E01LQ6", "B002NZK5RI", "B003AWRMA6", "B0006D3HGA"], "bought_together": ["B00008UALG", "B000056PNL"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00004STDN", "B00315462E", "B000BMY2N8", "B0045HCJ5S"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 168050}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.99, "brand": "Sony Pictures Home Entertainment", "asin": "B00007AJE3", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51S2Q02BJ2L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Eye See You (aka D-Tox)"}
{"description": "Trouble in Paradiseis the supreme example of \"the Lubitsch touch,\" that mastery of comic timing, diamond-cutter precision, and Continental sophistication that made Ernst Lubitsch a household name and the real star of every movie he directed. A pair of prodigiously talented, utterly charming scoundrels (Herbert Marshall, Miriam Hopkins) become personal assistants to an aristocratic Parisian widow (Kay Francis). Their target is her fortune, but she's such an elegant lady, and so agreeably smitten with her new right-hand man, that he's tempted to pursue a secondary objective. Marshall, Hopkins, and Francis aren't remembered as major stars, but in this enchanted moment they are sublime. Likewise the peerlessly pixilated Edward Everett Horton and Charlie Ruggles as the widow's stuffed-shirt suitors.Trouble in Paradiseis one of the best comedies ever made.

{"description": "Producer Gerry Anderson is something of a legend in his native England,  based primarily on the popular TV seriesThunderbirds, its various  spinoffs, and this, its 1962-'63 predecessor. All were produced in  \"Supermarionation\"; i.e., they're puppet shows--not especially sophisticated  ones (to say the least), but ones that many viewers seemed to adore. This  five-disc boxed set contains all 39 episodes ofFireball XL5, totaling nearly  17 hours (plus extras).The stories concern the efforts of captain-hero Steve Zodiac and his crew  (including Steve's love interest and a talkative robot, voiced respectively by  Anderson's then-wife Sylvia and Anderson himself; the pair were also cowriters)  to protect \"Sector 25\" of the solar system from alien invasion. They battle  killer rays and alien criminals, visit mysterious planets, and escape from all  manner of perilous circumstances... they use ray guns and fly around with  \"thrust packs\" and on \"jetmobiles\" (reducing the need for walking, which puppets  don't do so well)... in other words, typical sci-fi fare. But while the  animation is laughable (little attempt was made to disguise the strings that  hold up puppets and props alike) and the effects primitive, there's no denying  the show's campy charm (indeed, people who study such things consider it to be  an important influence on the sci-fi genre in general). Is it a bit too much of  a good thing? Probably not for anyone willing to make the investment. DVD extras  include photos, a couple of featurettes, and audio commentary on two episodes  (voice actor David Graham on \"The Doomed Planet\" and director Alan Pattillo on  \"Space City Special\").--Sam Graham", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00008PHCX", "B000P6R5T8", "B000065Q9A", "B00009RXJ0", "B0000AZKJ8", "B00LNBQ8SI", "B0000TWNB0", "B00012QLGE", "B000059RNA", "B00404ME2E", "B00F3L8P26", "B00020X85C", "B00020X85M", "B0062KMDWU", "B0001MZ7J6", "B001HUHBBS", "B00IS6WQ2S", "B00G5N6C8U", "B000BOH8Z0", "B00JEZWRE4", "B00IF0KAYS", "B000OY9V7A", "B003H9LIU2", "B005BYBZQ8", "B00E5G03I4", "B00FEOYY8G", "B00CDEJRDC", "B00I462XF2", "B000AOEMU0", "B00005JMZA", "B001DW2BG0", "B000JLTRHW", "B00022PZ56", "B00553KAK2", "B0000524FK", "B00ISSF7S6", "B005EDVLE2", "B00I099JO6", "B007AVO1MU", "B00I4X8KU2", "B00AIA884W", "B00HMOW9YM", "B00D9EJFZA", "B000BCCAEQ", "B0012EBV88", "B000BQ7JVG", "B0029WGIDK", "B009OE2ODY", "B008N8A3JE", "B000EXDS2A", "B005BUA1CQ", "B002KAIW44", "B005EXA87S", "B00J2PQZEY", "B000AOEMUA", "B0007YMWFK", "B00AJXO3ZQ", "B009OE2O3Y", "B00005JOJP", "B0012EBV8I", "B005TMXXX0", "B005TMY00K", "B0007TKH66", "B009OE2O2A", "B006LPHY6G", "B00GX7D5G0", "B003KSO3QQ", "B0096W46VW", "B009OE2O0C", "B002DQSKLU", "B00FM4S5O2", "B008MIYKS0", "B00FMGPVCO", "B0016B6ZJW", "B000HEWEJ4", "B000ZBEOHY", "B005FQ2H8W", "B0018BDDFE", "B00C6ACWLC", "B0000524FJ", "B003VJTGNE", "B00DRQETNI", "B001B0H7DG", "B000KLQUT4", "B000W4KT9G", "B0009UC80Q", "B000PAAJZG", "B004CZZZQI", "B003BLPEHE", "B003NHOJGS", "B005E7SFDI", "B001B0H7D6", "B002DUJ9Q6", "B0038AN1WI", "B003NOGNQU", "B005HIBWBG", "B006WDWBK6", "B002LIZWS4", "B001SGN1JM", "B000YENUOK"], "bought_together": ["B00008PHCX", "B000P6R5T8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000P6R5T8", "B00020X85C", "B00020X85M", "B00008PHCX"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 58812}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 35.23, "brand": "A&amp;E", "asin": "B00007J6DN", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510RVV6D9HL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Fireball XL5 - The Complete Series"}

{"description": "To quote New York movie critic Jay Sherman, voiced to Master Thespian perfection by Jon Lovitz, \"it stinks\" thatThe Criticlasted all but two seasons. \"I used to have a show on ABC,\" Sherman bitterly remarks at one point, \"for about a week.\" The show, created by Al Jean and Mike Reiss ofSimpsonslegend, fared no better when it moved to Fox, and little better when re-run on Comedy Central. But it did garner a devoted following, and thanks to DVD and the Internet, \"the last hope of fading stars\" (according to one of the ten \"Webisodes\" contained in this three-disc set), Jay Sherman lives! Television's saddest sack is the host of a TV review show,Coming Attractions. He must deal with the slings, arrows, and outrageous misfortunes heaped upon him by his ex-wife, adoptive WASP parents, and ratings-desperate Ted Turner-esque boss. On the movie front,The Criticis no less inside than the similarly ill-fatedAction, but its hilarious parodies of classics and contemporary blockbusters, from the musical \"Apocalypse Wow\" to \"Dennis the Menace II Society,\" make it much more accessible to any multiplex-goer.The Critictook particular glee in zinging Howard Stern, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Woody Allen and Soon-Yi. (We pause to praise the show's unsung heroes, Maurice Le Marche and Nick Jameson, who provide uncanny celebrity impersonations each episode). Some references have a longer shelf life than others. Conan O'Brien, at the time a fledgling talk-show host, certainly got the last laugh on a spied newspaper headline, \"Conan Replaced by Dancing Chicken.\" And the series' best episode, in which Jay reunites an estranged Roger Ebert and the late Gene Siskel, plays now as a touching tribute to the original Thumb and Thumber.The Criticis poised for discovery.

{"description": "Conspiracies abound inChildren of Dune, Sci-Fi Channel's praiseworthy miniseries sequel toFrank Herbert's Dune, loyally adapted from the Herbert novelsDune MessiahandChildren of Duneby John Harrison, who passed directorial duties (due to a scheduling conflict) to Greg Yaitanes, a 31-year-old TV director andDuneneophyte tackling his biggest assignment to date. Uninitiated viewers face a disadvantage; it's best to readHerbert's booksand/or see the first miniseries before plunging into this remarkably coherent tangle of political intrigue, unfolding 12 years after the events ofDune.To his horror, Maud'Dib--Arrakis emperor Paul Atreides (Alec Newman, reprising hisDunerole)--has become the unintended figurehead of a violent dictatorship, and his enemies are multiplying. Vanishing into the desert, he waits as destiny shapes his twin heirs Leto II (James McAvoy) and Ghanima (Jessica Brooks), who must contend with their scheming aunt Alia (Daniela Amavia) while Princess Wensicia (Susan Sarandon), of the enemy House Corrino, plots her own attack on Maud'Dib's familial empire. Exiled Atreides matriarch Lady Jessica (Alice Krige, giving the film's finest performance) returns to Arrakis, where the enormous, desert-dwelling sandworms face an uncertain future. As always, the spice must flow, and the universe's most coveted commodity remains at the center of this richly detailed and physically impressive production. Special effects range from awesome (fly-over shots of the capital city, Arakeen) to awful (the saber-tooth tigers look likeJumanjirejects), andDunedevotees will endlessly debate the miniseries' strengths and weaknesses. Some may desire more action to punctuate the film's inherent verbosity, but consensus will surely conclude that this isDunedone right, with monumental effort and obvious devotion from everyone involved.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000639EV", "0783226063", "B00371QQ0M", "0441328008", "0441294677", "0441104029", "076535148X", "0441102670", "0765351498", "0765362619", "0425068137", "0441172695", "B00008NGHU", "B00K2CHWYI", "0553580302", "0765351501", "0765362627", "0553580337", "0441966918", "B00J5LXMTG", "B006JN87WK", "B00077BPA0", "0553580272", "1847374255", "076534078X", "B00EQ2KVQQ", "0765322749", "0441172717", "B00005JNV9", "0765340798", "B008R65XN8", "0765353709", "B00B04NIZO", "B0002Y4TWE", "B002ZG99EK", "B000056WR3", "B000ATQYXI", "B003XURDAY", "B000B8I9XQ", "B002KPINY8", "0765340771", "B000001ZD2", "B00HWWUQYY", "B00CBFB8OE", "B0039PGH9G", "B00D3DJIG8", "0765301571", "B0045HCJ9O", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B002436WFI", "B00K7IPGS6", "B004EXWGHY", "B008JFUNHI", "B000BCCAEQ", "B00005QAPI", "B0006IIPIK", "B0006FO9B0", "B0010X744G", "B000E5N6B6", "B000VSDNFA", "B00005JM39", "B008M4MB8K", "B000JLTRHW", "1574925628", "B00JBGWP3Y", "B00JLDTB2U", "B00363WGB4", "B00003CXCT", "B008R52LA2", "B002I9Z8GW", "B008JFUNJQ", "B0050MB5KM", "B0019BI1DM", "B006MFQ4OS", "B002WNU0QM", "B002QW7ALM", "B000OY9VFW", "B005LAIHXQ", "B00C8CQTJY", "B00GX7D5G0", "B00E8S2JZ4", "B00JQYUV9Q", "B0007P0Y7C", "B00366F2NU", "B0009JE6G6", "B0000VCZK2", "0783225903", "B000062XF2", "B00A04YHI2", "B00HERGM86", "B001TH16DI", "B00A2H9OZS", "B003BV8I7C", "B001KOFH2G", "B001CEE1YE", "B000WTZ6SK", "B000BW7QWW", "B00H83EV5W", "B004HZY8OS", "B0029778T8"], "bought_together": ["0783226063"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0000639EV", "0783226063", "B00FP20ZCG", "0441172717"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 19117}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 89.99, "brand": "IVE", "asin": "B00008RUYH", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DQ3EJGD5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Frank Herbert's Children of Dune: Sci-Fi TV Miniseries (Two-Disc DVD Set)"}
{"description": "Hell Houses are a distinctly American phenomenon which began in 1990 just outside of Dallas, at the Trinity Assembly of God Church. The original Hell House was conceived as a modern-day fire-and-brimstone sermon. Today, this religious ceremony of sorts is replete with actors, extensive lighting equipment and full audio-visual tech crews. Inside the Hell House, tour guides dressed as demons take visitors from room to room to view depictions of school massacres, date rape, AIDS-related deaths, fatal drunk driving crashes, and botched abortions. Hell Houses have now spread to hundreds of churches worldwide. With full access to the behind-the-scenes action, HELL HOUSE follows the process from the first script meeting until the last of the 10,000 visitors passes through the Hell House doors. The movie gives a verite window into the whole process of creating this over-the-top sermon, while showing an intimate portrait of the people who fervently believe its message. The film also features a score by Bubba and Matthew Kadane, formerly of the band Bedhead.", "related": {"bought_together": ["B000KLQUV2"], "also_viewed": ["B000KLQUV2", "B00005LIRD", "B000BBOUAE", "B000JFXROC", "B001ENEWMY", "B0009I7NGC", "B003SC9B16", "B000EHT4JC", "B00007KK2I", "B004EBT81S", "B00008HCAU", "B000B7VZGK", "B000UDZNS6", "B000GCFYOY", "B0001OGUWW", "B008IG09FO", "B00HRJVHEK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000KLQUV2"]}, "price": 49.89, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 254348}, "asin": "B000092T6A", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41qFfKYoAdL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Hell House"}

With a cast like this you can't go wrong, but \"Confidence\" cons itself into thinking it's original, while Burns's abundant voice-overs state the obvious and plot twists unfold with minimal surprise.

{"description": "Though it bears little resemblance to the original 1969 thriller starring Michael Caine, the 2003 remake ofThe Italian Jobstands on its own as a caper comedy that's well above average. The title's a misnomer--this time it's actually a Los Angeles job--but the action's just as exciting as it propels a breezy tale of honor and dishonor among competing thieves. Inheriting Caine's role as ace heist-planner Charlie Croker, Mark Wahlberg plays straight-man to a well-cast team of accomplices, including Mos Def, Jason Statham, and scene-stealer Seth Green in a variation of the role originally played by Noel Coward. As the daughter of Croker's ill-fated mentor (Donald Sutherland), Charlize Theron is recruited to double-cross a double-crosser (Edward Norton in oily villain mode), and once again, speedily versatile Mini Coopers play a pivotal role in director F. Gary Gray's exhilarating car-chase climax.

{"description": "WhenMarried... with Childrendebuted on Fox TV on April 5, 1987 (followed byThe Tracey Ullman Showa half-hour later), the grungy sitcom became an instant flagship for Rupert Murdoch's upstart network. The program's much-publicized working title,Not the Cosbys(a dismissive reference to the cheerful vitality of Bill Cosby's hugely popular television clan on NBC'sThe Cosby Show) was a dead giveaway.Married... with Childrenwas going to be a trashier, raunchier, and far more cynical view of the American nuclear family. But it turned out the series actually fell into other caustic-domestic entertainment traditions, notably the Don Ameche and Frances Langford radio comedy series from the 1940s,The Bickersons, and Jackie Gleason's TV classic,The Honeymooners.The jokes were savage, key relationships were marked by ennui and indifference, and the Bundy family name couldn't help but make one think of America's most notorious, real-life serial killer at the time. Yet the show had a hint of Golden Age Hollywood gloss, a retro-screwball feel that one could detect in the snappy verbal warfare between husband Al Bundy (Ed O'Neill) and wife Peggy (Katey Sagal). The characters, and the show, eschewed sentimentality, which certainly opened the floodgates to comic cynicism but also kept a door ajar for moments of genuine sweetness. A decade later, however, by the time Fox cancelled the increasingly expensive series,Married... with Children's first-season tone would be considerably different, replaced by a stronger reliance on running jokes and character stereotypes, particularly concerning Bundy children Kelly (Christina Applegate) and Bud (David Faustino).That evolution makes watchingMarried... with Children's first 13 episodes, once again, quite instructive. Those programs are all on this two-disc set, including the startling pilot, in which Al and Peggy lock horns over marital politics and enlist naive new neighbors Steve (David Garrison) and Marcy (Amanda Bearse) in a battle of the sexes. There's also the classic \"Whose Room Is It, Anyway,\" concerning the Bundys'  competition to connive Steve and Marcy into building a recreation room, and \"Thinnergy,\" a very funny piece about a diet that supposedly boosts sexual interest.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00000F5W8", "B0006J27WY", "B0009YCLBS", "B000FBH3WM", "B000JBWWQK", "B000SSQ7J2", "B002FU8JTM", "B00127RAFS", "B001OXLGIM", "B001APMD1I", "B00I099JYQ", "B005CGI4EG", "B0000CGNEC", "B0000DFZ5O", "B0058J3S16", "B00GOC75Y2", "B0058JEHTS", "B002E58FT2", "B0000ZMH8S", "B0002W4SWW", "B00007KK56", "B000K7UBXE", "B0058JEHSO", "B000291Q3Y", "B00005JOHC", "B00005JM3G", "B00B04NJ12", "B0002NY8R6", "B00005JLEX", "B0072BNKHA", "B00JDCP0QA", "B0007Y08JW", "B007C8RZQ0", "B00008NV4G", "B0001Z3I1C", "B00008EY6N", "B0001BS3IY", "B000HT3P6U", "B000083C6V", "B0001ZMWXW", "B008L0YN6I", "B0002W4SX6", "B007KFZ85K", "B0058JEI06", "B0006IUE16", "B007C8RZYC", "B0006N2EZK", "B000G6BL88", "B00008AOX6", "B000RO6JZO", "B0002JZT5U", "B0001O3YHQ", "B00B04NIOU", "B004D2GMVM", "B00008YGRS", "B0001O3YLM", "B000QFCDAO", "B000068V9X", "B000291Q3O", "B00B04NII6", "B0001NBNIY", "B007C8RZL0", "B0000AKY3Q", "B0007WFXL2", "B00BUWD7SO", "B008L0YMZA", "B000068V9Y", "B000GPIPTM", "B0000TPA60", "B00068WOH8", "B000AQ68Z0", "B003IB0FSU", "B0006N2F0E", "B0007US79Y", "B008L0YMUK", "B00005JO2V", "B0001BS3IE", "B0002I837M", "B008412UKA", "B000MEYKAA", "B000B5XOR0", "B0009P42WI", "B0001XAODE", "B000H1RFXM", "B00BUWD7NE", "B002V9PEUE", "B000640WGM", "B0000E32X2", "B000BYRCQU", "B001E6JC30", "B000M343AI", "B00D2UMHB0", "B00BUWD7E8", "B000VZADPG", "B000SQFC0O", "B000FUTVLO", "B00009PY3X", "B0009IW88K", "B00HRCBGRA"], "bought_together": ["B00000F5W8", "B0006J27WY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005CGI4EG", "B0006J27WY", "B00GOC74YI", "B0009YCLBS"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 31353}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 11.48, "brand": "Columbia Tri Star", "asin": "B0000C9JFQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Je-mX9tlL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Married... with Children: Season 1"}

Instead of mere episode intros as on the first two boxed sets, Trey Parker and Matt Stone finally oblige us with actual episode commentary, or, as they call it, \"commentary-mini.\" On this optional audio track, Trey and Matt goof for about five minutes or so at the top of each episode, certifying some as favorites (\"Tweek vs. Craig,\" \"Jewbilee,\" and \"Worldwide Recorder Concert,\" which is described as \"a reverse after-school special from hell\"), championing others popularly dismissed bySouth Park's otherwise loyal fans (\"Jakovasaurs,\" \"Sexual Harassment Panda\"), and provocatively dismissing all ofseason 2.The third season was frantically produced simultaneously with the feature film,South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut. This was the season, Trey proclaims, \"whereSouth Parkturned the corner... and became good (as far as we were concerned).\" Among their most inspired conceits is the so-called \"Meteor Shower Party\" trilogy, three episodes that unfold over the course of one night, each focusing on a different kid. \"Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery\" pays homage to Hanna-Barbera-style animation andScooby-Doo, recasting Korn as the Mystery Inc gang. \"Rainforest Shmainforest,\" featuring a game Jennifer Aniston, cuts rainforest crusaders down to size. \"Mr. Hankey's Christmas Classics\" takes its irreverent cue from thealbum of the same name, and contains an outrageously obscure reference to the 1978 made-for-TVStar Wars Holiday Special. Throughout the season,South Parkis, as usual, a gleeful equal-opportunity offender, but the show's true gonzo spirit is truly illustrated in such surreal touches as the employment of live action in \"Tweek vs. Craig,\" the singing of \"The Morning After\" backwards to save Chef from the spell of \"The Succubus,\" and theSeinfeld-worthy argument over whether the term should be \"pirate ghosts\" or \"ghost pirates\" in \"Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery.\"--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00023P49M", "B0001ZWLVU", "B00023P49C", "B0006Z2L2Y", "B000ADWCYY", "B000CNESM6", "B000FSME2Y", "B000KLQUMQ", "B000R7I3XC", "B0018O5WUU", "B001O0TWXG", "B0030Y11UG", "B004MLEYTG", "B006W93ELK", "B009SQ9Q5M", "B000USUA8E", "B000022TSW", "B000LW7OKQ", "B00AEBB8TM", "B001O0TWXQ", "B000ZT0S9O", "B00105308I", "B006W93EM4", "B0030Y11NS", "B004MLEYT6", "B009SQ9Y7M", "B000OPO0LQ", "B008412UKA", "B00008YGRV", "B0000AQS81", "B000AQ68Z0", "B0012018OE", "B000E6ES9O", "B003VJTGKW", "B000083C6V", "B003DZX46G", "B0001MZ7KA", "B000HT3P6U", "B000RO6JZO", "0762435615", "B001CQONKO", "B009WSJHD2", "B000UAE7UE", "B00G4RCB14", "B001VFM0ZG", "B006IOAHTQ", "B0002XVQT4", "B000E0OE3K", "B000NNK4DM", "B00008YGRS", "B007ZFR67I", "B003L77G7Y", "B0007PAM06", "B000P2A6CA", "B007KFZ8AA", "B00G4RCF60", "B000067DNE", "B00LBHOCHS", "B000B5XOR0", "6305301700", "B007KFZ7YM", "B00CJEKA2I", "B0002WZRSG", "030789682X", "B00008YGRZ", "B000F9T700", "B003W5TO70", "B00005JM3G", "B001RIZ7OI", "B007KFZ85K", "B003CN5B7E", "B001G0MFFG", "B00C28X8IY", "B00000J8BV", "B0002NY8XA", "B007KFZ88M", "B00AEFZ8OY", "B0012KSUTA", "B00002RAO2", "B00330WP6Q", "B000ABKHZC", "B008412UQ4", "B00CJEK7GW", "B007Z3UUF0", "B00E0FW054", "B000GPYMZS", "B006IOAHPK", "B003XJABTK", "B007KFZ7UQ", "B003V3FVQ6", "B004QP7WTC", "B0001LJBTE", "B0007CILMA", "B00K8HAJN8", "B000B5XOWU", "0762435704", "B00003CXS7", "B00H3JJCW8", "B001MT7ZI8"], "bought_together": ["B00023P49M", "B00023P49C"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00023P49M", "B00023P49C", "B0006Z2L2Y", "B0001ZWLVU"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 16296}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 14.12, "brand": "Paramount", "asin": "B0000CABL2", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51rGlTEGXrL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "South Park: Season 3"}

{"description": "Miles Swan's romantic comedyThe Tripspans 11 years, charting the lives of two men through the Gay Rights movement of the '70s, the conservative backlash of the Reagan-era, and through the AIDS epidemic. Straight, Young Republican author Alan (played by Larry Sullivan) meets Tommy (Steve Braun), a Gay Rights activist, while Alan is completing his anti-gay book. Falling in love with Tommy, Alan tries to avoid publishing \"The Straight Truth,\" but an alleged friend of Alan's underhandedly sabotages him by not only publishing it but also securing for it a place on the bestseller list. As a converted gay man, this enrages Alan and also ruins Tommy's credit as an activist, thereby breaking them up for several years during the '80s. Finally, the two do reunite to pledge their eternal love, though under tragic circumstances. Relevant gay rights news footage, from Stonewall for example, historically sets each segment in the film, making the movie more realistic and educational. Alan and Tommy's plight to fight for the acceptance of homosexuality takes on metaphorical significance, while other characters in the film, like Tommy's best friend, Michael (Alexis Arquette), and Alan's mother (Jill St. John), bring the narrative humor specific toThe Tripback into focus. At times, the movie verges on corny, but for the most part avoids clich&#xE9;. The satisfaction one gets from watching a deep relationship unfold over the years makes this coming-of-age tale a meaningful reminder that there is absolutely no justification for keeping any couples in love apart.--Trinie Dalton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0013D8LCW", "B002SSNFUO", "B00996RSYM", "B00GHP8SH4", "B0042KZJFA", "B004L03B3S", "B00F98FOPE", "B0002I84JO", "B002PCVLWW", "B000CR7R7K", "B0083V2VYG", "B0080JX4Y2", "B00E849QSG", "B0062QHZJU", "B005GM38MO", "B00013WVI0", "B001Y7CVXC", "B007L6JQ3S", "B0000B1A36", "B0084BM7NK", "B00008UALE", "B002L1YGRY", "B006GGREO2", "B0042L0OG8", "B000VKJ6UE", "B0000639HT", "B000WDVNMO", "B006VJI6IM", "B001NGNLEW", "B000UNYJOK", "B000R7G9JW", "B008N25X7M", "B0096UG7XY", "B004XKUFY4", "B007OXB1GI", "B00FGG60XY", "B00GSA3K6C", "B0001HAGRE", "B006FYYWQS", "B00HHYF5EI", "B00JVX8194", "B003IG06PM", "B00B2DGYQS", "B00AWQEK26", "B00FPVGWY2", "B000BZISX0", "B00IA7MFEO", "B0000560PU", "B005OTQIK8", "B00564HZYY", "B0042L0OFE", "B00153CLNK", "B00EU8RB14", "B001ATWK2Q", "B00F878KAC", "B0062QHZKY", "B00DUJH8V2", "B009J212G6", "B00DUJH94S", "B00000F5B5", "B00008YLU4", "B00099415C", "B0038M61J6", "B000FTJ74Q", "B005TIK4SQ", "B000HLDFMM", "B000HWXPXK", "B005C6BGVY", "B000SQJ28C", "B005GM38JW", "B003Y9NXDK", "B008JFX04G", "0780629167", "B000NVT0UM", "B002Y3GZD2", "B000F6II1M", "B00E99FYOK", "B008YUHQEG", "B009SFR2QI", "B00005UF80", "B005GM38NI", "B0042L0OFY", "B00014NE62", "B00064AFF0", "B00CC2V7AQ", "B009W8MYK0", "B001AOC9K4", "B0001KNHAO", "B00004UEDZ", "B0099PW0D2", "B00I2U91Z0", "6305744777", "B00005QAQD", "B0055HOIMY", "B0006GVJEY", "B00CKZE7FC", "B00HUQCA28", "B00008AOTW"], "bought_together": ["B002SSNFUO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0002I84JO", "B002SSNFUO", "B002L1YGRY", "B00E849QSG"]}, "price": 12.58, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 86843}, "asin": "B0000DD75N", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5119ZMY7R1L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Trip"}

In the wake of territorial murder, free-grazing cowboys Boss (Robert Duvall) and Charley (Costner) seek vengeful justice against the ruthless rancher (Michael Gambon) who threatens their law-abiding survival. A feisty ally (the late Michael Jeter, in his next-to-final film role) and a doctor's sister (Annette Bening) offer support during climactic shootouts, masterfully staged with the shock and suddenness of real-life gunfire.

Fully embracing new friends and local color, she finds herself immersed in a life-changing adventure filled with enough unexpected surprises, laughter, friendship, and romance to restore her new home -- and her belief in second chances.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0042816YK", "B004SIP6BI", "B002ZG988M", "B000LXHK2C", "B000MQC9H4", "B000BNX3B4", "B0017ANB08", "B00005JPSM", "B00006ZXSI", "B0038N9WKU", "B0000CE684", "0767900383", "B002RSDW80", "B000C8STWQ", "B00008G7UF", "B0001I55M4", "B000YDBPAM", "B003B3V0W0", "B0001AVZA8", "B0009OL7Z4", "B000023VTP", "630560097X", "B005S9EJ14", "B001LPWGBY", "B004SIP9RO", "B000EHRVOW", "B00006FMUW", "B004SIP8LG", "B00008NRI7", "B000CCBCAS", "0307885283", "B003ASLJK4", "B00006ZXSO", "B00EEW1D2Y", "B004SIP7D0", "B000HEWEE4", "B00AEBB8YW", "B0002B15Y2", "B00AMEZDK6", "B0000AOV4I", "B0021L8UO4", "B001DB6J6Y", "B00AEBB8SS", "B000J103OI", "B003B3V0N4", "B00AEFXYOA", "B00081U7HC", "B00005JG6N", "B009NOF57C", "B00EIBO8T6", "B003BV8ICC", "B00007E2F5", "B000OCZA04", "B00EZC8042", "0783240171", "B0071HPOGK", "B0038N9X3Q", "B004XVMCMG", "B000JYW5EQ", "B0007TKOAA", "B003PIUIJC", "B004DK5CW4", "6304765266", "B0000524E5", "B0021L8UZS", "B00C888MJ8", "B002NZK5TQ", "B004EPYZP8", "B00003CXSM", "B0045HCJJ4", "B00E7YMTB8", "B001AKTZW8", "B002ZG989G", "B0017ANAZO", "B000XJD33O", "B000053VB4", "B000085OY1", "B00000JGHK", "6305212112", "B000ELJAEM", "B000EMGICS", "B001QYOY3S", "B0013D8LHC", "B00D7HBV10", "B002K0WBXW", "B005MYEQ4U", "B0030BOCFU", "B000E1ZBGS", "B001TUZD8O", "B00003CXXG", "B002NZK5V4", "B0050MB584", "B00006ZXSQ", "B002ZG99UE", "B00319ECB0", "B000CCW2P2", "B00006RCNY", "B0006U5UT0", "B004UXUX4Q"], "bought_together": ["B0042816YK", "B002ZG988M"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0042816YK", "B002ZG988M", "B000LXHK2C", "B00008G7UF"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 3338}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.62, "brand": "Touchstone Video", "asin": "B0000VD02Y", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51VTXVEM36L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Under the Tuscan Sun (Widescreen Edition)"}

And a few explosions as bodies fly through the air and crash into tables and fruit stands.Once Upon a Time in Mexico, like all Robert Rodriguez movies, is all about the kinetic kick of high-velocity action. Johnny Depp, blase and whimsical, plays a CIA agent who's drawn guitar-playing gun-slinger Antonio Banderas (long black hair flopping over his face like the ears of a Labrador puppy) into a ridiculously convoluted plot to overthrow the Mexican government. Along for the ride are a craggy-faced rogue's gallery including Willem Dafoe, Mickey Rourke, Danny Trejo, Ruben Blades, and (to balance things out) the smooth, tantalizing complexions of Eva Mendes and Salma Hayek. For sheer trashy fun,Once Upon a Time in Mexicois a step down from its predecessor,Desperado--butDesperadoset the bar pretty high.

Bob Gossage (comedian-actor Alan Davies) is a thoroughly gay, Manchester schoolteacher who falls for Rose (Lesley Sharp), a vibrant secretary stuck with a boyfriend she doesn't love and a na&#xEF;ve mother bent on marrying a creepy con artist. Bob and Rose's bumpy, inexplicable affair has its share of doubts, and there are many rules to be re-written (Rose stands by her man whenever he insists that he's gay, not bi-sexual).Yet these two know, instinctively, they are meant to grow up and out of their respective singles scenes (straights on one end of a club-dominated street, gays on the other end), no matter how painful their course or how often friends attempt to sabotage them. Davies and Sharp fully inhabit the rich characters created by writer Russell T. Davies, creator of the original, British version ofQueer as Folk.

{"description": "The dark underside ofBoogie Nightsis tracked inWonderland, a sleaze-filled look at the notorious \"Wonderland Murders\" of 1981. The movie attempts to explain how the legendarily endowed porn actor John C. Holmes was involved in the killings, while deliberately suggesting the difficulty of knowing the truth of a murky case. The police procedural aspects turn out to be less intriguing than the weirdly hapless domestic life of Holmes (Val Kilmer at his most dazed), who despite his promiscuity continues to rely on his starchy, clean-cut wife (an unflattering role for Lisa Kudrow, but the most interesting character in the picture). Well-known actors--notably a near-unrecognizable Dylan McDermott--slouch through the story, which rather distracts from the aggressively realistic approach. In the end, the unclean aura makes one yearn for the stylized ingenuity ofBoogie Nights, or at least a reason to be watching this story this way.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["1605420832", "B000PAAJZ6", "B00005NB8K", "B00005JKM2", "B0000C9JE0", "B00005JM23", "B00003CXWV", "B001AK3S4O", "B00441GYZ6", "1593936745", "0792838068", "B00022XE6S", "B000P0J0D8", "B00IKM5MIA", "B00ET2ODTE", "1593936850", "B00009MEKN", "B00004XPPB", "B00049QQHI", "B000087F7Q", "B000EHRVP6", "B002AF4Y9G", "B004SEUJXM", "6301971345", "B002O3Z4Y8", "B00002RAO2", "B00008YJDK", "B00004ZBVM", "B00AEBB89W", "B0000AC8LR", "B000AXWHSA", "B000ZS8GWQ", "B0013D8LKO", "0783229526", "B0001EFV7C", "B000F5GNX8", "B00195I3O0", "B000083C6I", "B00GUO2SKA", "B0009G3B0G", "B00GMV8IVE", "B000GI3KGC", "B0045HCJG2", "B0000542C4", "6305594333", "B00005Q4CS", "B000NO39FG", "B004SIP8ZM", "B000MMMTBY", "B0009A40ES", "B005Z9MFCM", "B00D5XC8PE", "6305313687", "B00AEFXESQ", "B00005A3KS", "B000LAZDPG", "B000P0J0AG", "B00005JMBQ", "B00AFEXRME", "B006LL3W0W", "B000B74GCA", "B002Q4VBPQ", "B002GIBVVQ", "B00070Q7VE", "B002VWNIEA", "B004SIP9CO", "1909394122", "B0009YA3OA", "B0057ZAA6W", "B000A7DVR2", "1558908390", "B000R7HY0K", "0767812182", "B000JMK6LW", "B000P0J09M", "B000BBOUW2", "B00005N89M", "B000R4SMCW", "B001L28J2M", "0780619951", "B0000AM6JI", "B00HOGBXS6", "B00002E20R", "B000069HZP", "B000U1ZV76", "B00005K3NU", "B000K2UVZM", "B00092ZM7U", "B002ZG99N6", "B000FWHW86", "B000002UKO", "6304696558", "B000F1IQN2", "B00FRILRW0", "B00007KK50", "B008FYZI3M", "B0042DN4U4", "B00005QJIG"], "bought_together": ["B000PAAJZ6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005NB8K", "1605420832", "B00005JKM2", "B00HWWUQWQ"]}, "price": 24.95, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 164098}, "asin": "B00014K58W", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51FJ1Qo421L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Wonderland"}
{"description": "As the 26th installment in a popular film series that lasted 27 years,Zatoichiis essentially a \"greatest hits\" compendium of all the films that preceded it. That makes it essential viewing for Zatoichi fans and anyone interested in the voluminous \"source code\" for Quentin Tarantino'sKill Bill. Known in Japan asZatoichi 26orZatoichi '89, this lavish production was the last to star Shintaro Katsu, who originated the title role of \"the Blind Swordsman\" in 1962'sThe Tale of Zatoichiand served triple-duty as writer and director of this stylishly violent latter-day adventure. Now much older and still a wandering loner, the blind, peace-loving masseur Ichi (or, in Japanese,Zato Ichi) seeks a quiet life among the gentle people of Edo Period villages, but when he's caught in a power struggle between rival Yakuza clans, his reputation as a deadly defender of the innocent precedes him, and he's forced to fend for himself in a series of sword-wielding showdowns. Between geysers of spurting crimson, this gorgeousZatoichifilm delivers good humor and mild sentiment, although series devotees were justifiably disappointed when the familiar plot failed to advance Zatoichi's legend in a middle-aged context. Still, the action sequences are frequent and fun, and despite controversy surrounding an accidental death during the climactic battle (for which Katsu's son, playing a villain, was ultimately found not guilty), this was a fitting farewell to Katsu's involvement in the franchise, which was revived once again with the successful release of Takeshi \"Beat\" Kitano'sZatoichiin 2003.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0017MO0U6", "B000ASATM6", "B00EO2I6OM", "B003JETUN2", "B0000A02TS", "B0002DB54U", "B0000A02TT", "B003BNCMVS", "B0001NBNH0", "B0002DB554", "B0000A02TR", "B000BPK2HK", "B00008K76R", "B0029Z8KD8", "B0001OGURC", "B0001OGURM", "B000C6NP7M", "B0002DB55O", "B00008K76P", "B000FKPE9W", "B00008K76Q", "B000JBXP4S", "B00HE01030", "B0001UZRN4", "B00073K7KI", "B00IQAUO2A", "B00GBT62PQ", "B0001Z9352", "B00006IUI1", "B00687XNNK", "B000063UQV", "B003152Z4U", "B00006IUI3", "B001PCNZJU", "B00ET2ODX0", "B0001J0VYK", "B0001BFDI2", "B0001J0VYA", "B003KGBISY", "B00I462XNO", "B00G3HOLV8", "B00GS08Y3Q", "B00I462XGG", "B00IQAUO5C", "B00IQAUO6Q", "B00IQAUO48", "B003VE9WRE", "B002KYIAL0", "B000KJTFYI", "B00I3C1T6G", "B00065GX0K", "B00GOT1DIE", "B000063UQU", "B00HGBAG5K", "B0001610OS", "B0000B1ODS", "B006H3KQSK", "B0009NZ774", "B00006IUI2", "B008H1Q3NW", "B001L28H10", "B000O7864G", "B004XQO8MS", "B005VU9LKE", "B002KYIAKQ", "B008L0YMSW", "B002CLKP0K", "B0007989YS", "B006HAJ9FE", "B0009IW8CQ", "B004ODLUJO", "B0002W4TOO", "B000AQKUD6", "B00265T7JM", "B000GTJT1Q", "B000F2CAJ2", "B001HN694K", "B00097DXTO", "B000GNOH6E", "1586558315", "B005ENCIWG", "B000IHYXSK", "B006LLY8LY", "B000EWBNZK", "B0001I54UC", "B003BV8HXC", "B001DWNUEC", "B002SF9YQQ", "B001JQHT2Q", "B000AQKUCW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0017MO0U6", "B00EO2I6OM", "B000ASATM6", "B003JETUN2"]}, "price": 12.33, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 217189}, "asin": "B0001610RU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41AVQWC7FWL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Zatoichi - Darkness Is His Ally"}

{"description": "The slippery protagonist ofThe Talented Mr. Ripleyreturns in another deadly guise inRipley's Game, a well-appointed star vehicle. The star this time is John Malkovich, whose older Tom Ripley has settled into an Italian villa and a life of aesthetic contemplation (a little like Hannibal Lecter inHannibal). A former partner (Ray Winstone) drags an innocent frame-maker (Dougray Scott), dying of leukemia, into the role of unexpected hit man. Ripley, for his own enigmatic reasons, helps. Liliana Cavani, ofThe Night Porternotoriety, directed this handsome if nebulous film (which has no connection to theMatt Damon picture, other than a Patricia Highsmithsource novel). Malkovich exudes his usual oily disenchantment with the world; Lena Headey, like the location footage, is gorgeous. The same novel was adapted in very different style by Wim Wenders for his brilliant 1977 film,The American Friend, with Dennis Hopper and Bruno Ganz.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEBB8SS", "B009D004TA", "B0035ECHJA", "0393332128", "0393332136", "039333211X", "0393333191", "0393332144", "0393321983", "B00006LPC6", "0375407928", "B00005BCKG", "B00000F7E6", "B00005UQ9T", "B00CT6EJEG", "B009D0050I", "B004ALIG4M", "B000PMGS7C", "B00007AJF8", "0393324559", "B00IOFDKL4", "B000QXDCLK", "B0000SXK0E", "B000069HZU", "B00094AS6I", "0393322440", "B00AQBDU4Q", "B00HOGBXS6", "B00008RV1F", "B00393SG56", "6304696515", "B0000AZT79", "B00005O5B8", "B00008RH3L", "B00005B6L0", "B00008K7AO", "B004NWPY20", "B000286RNE", "B00004REAG", "B000E33VWW", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B005KKVAHW", "B000PKG8TM", "B0000AGQ5V", "B00EF1PKX2", "B00112S8RS", "B0036TGSRG", "0767833600", "B000GIW9I2", "0871132907", "B00JAQJNN0", "B00005Y6XA", "B000EQHXNW", "B0009GX1CE", "B002GYKTZO", "B00CUKTHES", "B004P7CMUU", "B002O3Z4WU", "B00005AUJI", "B00009Y3PV", "B00441GYOM", "B00005JMVQ", "B00DUX290S", "B000065U1F", "B00D3LA5WG", "B001VPCINK", "B000006YEQ", "B005TZFZ5Q", "B001UFE8PM", "B00562D3Y2", "B00G9W7N6W", "B00005JKJA", "B0040J1RX6", "B0009VRHLK", "B007IUEEA2", "B00166UFA2", "B009UTX4M8", "B0059XTTW8", "B00003CWSX", "B0002V7SOS", "B00005BCK9", "B0016AKSOG", "B000NIVJFY", "B009OCR2U6", "B000E33W0I", "B0034G4P30", "B002LVVCJY", "B00DZP1C2W", "B001NFNFNU", "B0001LJCQQ", "B00BUWD76Q", "B009POCG0Y", "B000S6UZTC", "B000063K2Q", "B0013XZ2QK", "B002ZG993Q", "B00BLF9FYA", "B000E6ESXK", "B000H6SXYM", "B0001EFV7C"], "bought_together": ["B00AEBB8SS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0792165020", "0393332136", "B009D004TA", "B00HV46PBG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 86425}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.49, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00018D40O", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51NBNWQRPNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Ripley's Game"}
{"description": "While it falls squarely into the precious category of love-it-or-leave-it art-house oddities, the hypnotically absurd Swedish comedySongs from the Second Flooris certainly unlike any other movie you've ever seen. That alone is reason to check it out, and many pleasures await those who are receptive to director Roy Andersson's conspicuously offbeat worldview, presented here as a series of marginally connected vignettes illustrating a bleak world that has literally ground to a halt. A perpetual traffic jam lurches through an urban landscape imbued with post-apocalyptic atmosphere, a ghost town populated by pale, shell-shocked citizens bereft of hope and teetering on the edge of collective madness. Characters and plot are nonexistent in any conventional sense; it's as if Andersson has cast himself as a detached God, gazing upon these lost souls from a distant remove, as if they were fish in a tank, lumbering through their oppressive city like zombies at the dead-end of civilization. Described by critic J. Hoberman as \"slapstick Ingmar Bergman,\" this highly unusual film is certainly not for everyone, but if you're on its wavelength it's sure to prove unforgettably amusing.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002VWNIFE", "B000I8OOG0", "B00HE010QM", "B00HE011DE", "B000B5Y0D2", "B0009XRZQK", "B00K0MM4AM", "B007P470R0", "B00GBT62PQ", "B000KCI92E", "B001E1B6RA", "B00GOT1DIE", "B00450AGAU", "B00BC75H5S", "B00AQ6J5JU", "B008ZDC7M8", "B000PKG6O4", "0312420099", "B000OYNVOO", "B00474ID4U", "B00AX7PGQS", "B006PGL7OQ", "B00F98FOI6", "B0000BWVCR", "B00HT2RTU6", "B00BC75HTE", "B0048FQFFM", "B0007P0X9G", "B001MPS7GG", "B0048LPRD2", "B00003CWTI", "B00CD6VY6S", "B002QFYJF4", "B000G8NXZ0", "B00005JLV7", "B003ZYU3U0", "B002N7SX8E", "1572528060", "B0014G7HU0", "B00009Y3PG", "B00074CC50", "B00007L4MH", "B0001AOYGA"], "bought_together": ["B0009XRZQK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002VWNIFE", "B00HOS1N48"]}, "price": 29.95, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 136677}, "asin": "B0001AP0PE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HHSJRPZRL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Songs from the Second Floor"}
{"description": "This two-disc set certainly improves upon the fluffyReloadedDVD release. Although there's still no Wachowski brothers talking about their creation, there's a lot of good stuff here in the three main segments. We are constantly reminded how long the back-to-back filming schedule was, and it's most interesting to hear from the actors and artists as they come to the end of this long road. When a white rabbit flashes on screen, you can \"branch\" the most interesting documentary footage: how \"bullet time\" is being recalibrated and how you go about replicating so many Agent Smiths.

{"description": "Whatever footage those omnipresent cameras caught of the medical and substance abuse travails that landed the Osbournes in the tabloids and the gossip columns must have wound up on the cutting room floor. Instead, these 10 episodes that concluded the Emmy-nominated season 2 amp the Osbournes' hysterical dysfunctions to 11. The internecine warfare between siblings Jack and Kelly goes Fallujah in \"What a Boy Wants\" and \"Fists of Fury,\" an episode that, according to one website, features 135 bleeped obscenities, which must be a series benchmark. But in time-honored, reassuring sitcom convention, family ties are reinforced by episode's end. When the dust has settled in \"Fists,\" Jack and Kelly bond in the kitchen over Easy Mac. Nothing unites the fractious Osbournes like obnoxious neighbors, but in \"Tennis Racket,\" not even Jack's drumming or Ozzy's stereo blasts can stop their incessant tennis-playing neighbors. Jack enjoys something of a breakout half season. He turns 17 and goes Medieval (Times) in \"What a Boy Wants.\" He hooks up with Kurt Cobain's sister in \"A Little Ditty About Jack and Brianne\" (which also features the surreal sight of a panty-clad Courtney Love reciting Shakespeare!).  Another snapshot for the Osbourne family album is Ozzy and Jack disrupting a fishing trip by lobbing firecrackers at birds in \"Angler Management.\" Throughout, Ozzy is his delightful, addled self. In \"Run Ozzy Run,\" his new car's voice-recognition system can't understand him (for viewers with the same problem, this DVD includes the helpful Ozzy Translator). In \"What a Boy Wants,\" a dentist administers the \"Ozzy level\" of nitrous oxide, with debilitating results. The season ends with aDallas-esque mind-bleep of Bobby-in-the-shower proportions that calls the reality of the series in question.

The affliction introduces a broad, slapstick, spoof of countless sword-and-sorcery anime plots, complete with a long-imprisoned god, demonic creatures feeding on human emotional energy, ancient curses, and battles between white and black magic. But the principal villains are octopi who've gotten tired of being treated as seafood by humans.

{"description": "\"We have evil in us, all of us do, and my evil just happened to come out  because of the circumstances,\" said serial killer Aileen Wuornos in an  interview conducted shortly before her execution in 2002. Director Nick  Broomfield, in this sequel to his previous documentaryAileen Wuornos:  The Selling of a Serial Killer, delves further into Wuornos's horrific  childhood (including an interview with her biological mother) and follows  the appeals process as her case goes through its final efforts. But the  movie's core are the fascinating, devastating interviews with Wuornos  herself, alternately lucid and delusional as she obsesses about the  police, whom she believes allowed her murders to happen to increase the  potential for profit from movies and books about the case. Anyone who's  seenMonster, based on Wuornos's story, will find the real woman  even more compelling and frightening than Charlize Theron's award-winning  portrayal.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0001KNHM2", "B0029Z8K74", "1593762909", "B001LN6NRE", "B0051QS1P4", "B001BEK8CO", "B008I1G6Y2", "0786034149", "B0029Z8K7E", "B000M9BPF8", "B000NDIAQA", "B000050HEP", "B0051QS1R2", "B005IQGNHK", "B00003CWN3", "B000RW5BYG", "B0051QS1OK", "B001BXTPPQ", "1844542378", "B002FUIIYS", "B00008DDJ4", "B003VOVW18", "B000S0SYHI", "B0051QS1RM", "B006Z7Z3L8", "B002K0UNZA", "B000BB154I", "B00160ANUA", "B0051QS1OA", "B001BEK8FQ", "B007NNPJBM", "B0021L8UPS", "B0051QS1Q8", "B00000K0DQ", "B00AIBZKFG", "B00EI2CT7S", "B006IRQU44", "B000A2X3QG", "B00347AIOO", "0312984189", "B000KLQUUS", "B004JR3OKI", "B005F0TH1S", "B00BUWD7E8", "B000EOTEEK", "B00527TSV8", "B00AEFXBPM", "B004DTLKEE", "B0023GFWWU", "B00027JYNK", "B0045HCIYA", "B00007AJE1", "B0042DN4U4", "B0002KPIQY", "B003VWC4BW", "B000MNOXX0", "B00005QAQI", "B002LVVEG0", "B00013RC2K", "B001GZM44I", "B008UIAMVQ", "B00005U14H", "B000E0OBJM", "B002NZK5RI", "B000NIVJFY", "B001IHJ97Y", "0743417607", "0790742829", "B00GHJ3T92", "B00009WVSL", "0929387759", "1561712930", "B007XF0W3K", "1844540790", "B0009A40ES", "0131141619", "0739441957", "B003WKQ47S"], "bought_together": ["B0001KNHM2", "B0029Z8K74"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0029Z8K74", "B0001KNHM2", "1593762909", "B008I1G6Y2"]}, "price": 18.72, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 174913}, "asin": "B0001Z36Y6", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51M5J87FFYL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Aileen - Life and Death of a Serial Killer"}

{"description": "Millenniummarked the second major television series created by Chris Carter, who'd already made his name as the brains behindThe X-Files. And, like its predecessor, it shares a lot of the same themes--it's a crime thriller that gradually unfolds into a grand conspiracy involving the government and the fate of the entire world.Agent Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) is a former FBI agent who has transplanted his family from Washington, D.C. to Seattle, after suffering something of a breakdown. He's an expert criminal profiler--arguably the best, thanks to his ability to \"see\" into the minds of killers--and he fears for the safety of his wife and young daughter. In Seattle, he joins the mysterious Millennium Group, an agency of freelance crime-busters who investigate particularly brutal crimes. As a result,Millenniumis downright bleak viewing, as Black jumps from horrific slaying to horrific slaying. Moreover, there's a growing sense of unease about the workings of the Millennium Group, so that in typical Chris Carter fashion, you don't know who to trust. With its pre-Y2K angst and overwhelming darkness, as well as its general humorlessness,Millenniumhasn't dated as well asThe X-Files. Still, thanks to Carter's vision and Henriksen's compelling take on the tortured Black, it's difficult not to get hooked.--Ted Kord", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000667HBS", "B0009X76XW", "B0006UEVUE", "B000EXDS3E", "B000EXDS3Y", "B000BOH98G", "B000BOH986", "B000BOH990", "B000CNE0T2", "B000CNE0SS", "B000EXDS34", "B000CNE0TC", "B0007X7044", "B001FACH7S", "B000O77SMW", "B000FOPPBA", "B000ATQYXI", "1480277460", "B000AM6OQ2", "B0000AOX0A", "B001G7PSZI", "B00028HOMM", "B00JQYV0B4", "B0056GLNQI", "B00E0KWBAI", "B001MVWRMU", "B0081QF6Q8", "B005HMHPE0", "B0001O3YD0", "B0015ET3YO", "0060575913", "0143039911", "B004X60QE2", "B0006UEVTK", "B00022FWEU", "B0013DZNAA", "B00HUPC5X8", "B00005JM67", "B000BCCAEQ", "B000056BP1", "B00E5S2HGS", "0060083972", "B00FUABG1C", "B004YPED14", "B001MVWRN4", "B001RHGRTS", "B00BTFK01Y", "B00B5ARKC0", "6304698763", "0141182342", "B0009NZ2RE", "B0013ZGN9I", "B00062IDEW", "B001CY5N00", "B0000694XX", "B0007N1AM2", "B001MVWRNE", "B000N3T0EG", "B00004YC1W", "B000FJH5M2", "B000HT3P60", "B000EOTTS6", "B001MVWRNO", "B00008NV4G", "B0000AOX09", "B0053O8A46", "B00A8KJN8M", "B005S9EJ8W", "B000B5XOVQ", "B003UD7J26", "B001AZIRZO", "B005LAIHXQ", "B0002V7OI8", "B0009W5J4Q", "B0055SNHQG", "B002AS464Q", "B001715A92", "B0051GOB2G", "B000MV8ABS", "B00AATGDUC"], "bought_together": ["B000667HBS", "B0009X76XW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001CY5N00", "B0006UEVUE", "B000667HBS", "B001FACH7S"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 75357}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 20.65, "brand": "TCFHE", "asin": "B000244E2O", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51VH96EF60L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Millennium - The Complete First Season"}
{"description": "Some boxed sets claim to be definitive, but are haphazardly selected. Not this one. Four of the five titles here can legitimately lay claim to being essentials in the film noir canon, and the fifth,The Set-Up, is a terrific boxing picture with a strong noir atmosphere. If you're a fan of noir--or have no idea what it's all about--this collection is a treat.Of course, none of these movies were made as \"film noir.\" The term was coined later by French critics to describe the moody, anxious feel of postwar American movies, especially the genre that highlighted duplicitous dames and susceptible men lost in the criminal jungle. Indeed, the titleThe Asphalt Jungleconveys the edgy urban arena of these pictures. That film is John Huston's masterly 1950 account of a heist, with Sterling Hayden the disenchanted, noirish hero. Joseph H. Lewis'sGun Crazy(1949) is one of the most supercharged (and sexually perverse) of noir films, with John Dall and Peggy Cummins as young criminals in love.Murder, My Sweet(1944) is a straight adaptation of Raymond Chandler's novelFarewell, My Lovely. Amid the film's shadowy chiaroscuro, former musical comedy star Dick Powell makes a career-changing transition as Chandler's private dick, Philip Marlowe.Out of the Pastputs Robert Mitchum (perhaps the quintessential noir actor) in trouble with gangster Kirk Douglas, complicated by classic femme fatale Jane Greer. Jacques Tourneur provides the evocative direction. AndThe Set-Upplays out an ingenious boxing tale in \"real time,\" superbly enacted by (former boxer) Robert Ryan.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000FI9OCW", "B003G9IT3C", "B0024FAG80", "B000PKG7DE", "B0024FAG8A", "B00097DY20", "B000B8384Q", "B00005RDRL", "B0007TKNKQ", "B002YNQEFG", "B00023P4GA", "B00005AUK9", "B0007ZEO8C", "B0087ZG7OI", "B002YNQEF6", "B000CNE088", "B000BQ5IXW", "B00023P4II", "B0007ZEO7S", "B003B3V0RA", "B00114XLTQ", "B00004XPPK", "B001CC7PM6", "B00007ELDG", "B00114XLUA", "B00004W229", "B00AQ6J5YA", "B000EXDSBQ", "6305999872", "B000087F79", "B000RXVND8", "B000PKG7CU", "B004C2523M", "B000LN6UHI", "B00012L786", "B000EXDSBG", "B002945DUM", "B0024FAG6W", "B0006Z2NS6", "B000B83846", "B000I2JDF8", "B001ASQ9OC", "B000GRUQJW", "B009X919UE", "B00004W19C", "B001QFFBAM", "B00008LDNZ", "B0009X7678", "B000BGH2NG", "B00I3C1T34", "B00D09AXUA", "B00457ZNS8", "B000FMGTQC", "B001CC7PLW", "B001OSC4G0", "B005152C9G", "B00023P4FQ", "B000KJTGFG", "B000YRY7VC", "B00006II5J", "B000B8380A", "B00114XLUU", "B008BSM1CI", "B000FFJYA2", "B00K6D1S7A", "B000A0GOEQ", "B00CVB6XF2", "B00ICWO1LC", "B000M2E3GI", "B00DBE97S8", "B0006HBV3C", "B000FKO3VM", "B0010KHOSA", "B0011FDVEK", "B00AEBBA7W", "B0006Z2NE0", "B0006UEVVS", "B000GIXLUW", "B0010KHOSU", "B0007TKNHY", "B0009X7682", "B000JLTRGI", "B006GVNHMA", "B000CNE08I", "0312180764", "1590201442", "B00AEFXN9G", "B0026ZQJP2", "B00AF4OTM6", "B00097DY0M", "B0000694WH", "0879101970", "B00C3ALM02", "B00EL6A7XE", "B008K1PXIK", "B000UJCAK4", "B00005AUKD", "B005H8G78O", "B00KIZY3XW"], "bought_together": ["B000FI9OCW", "B003G9IT3C"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000244EYW", "B0024FAG80", "B000244EX8", "B000244EWO"]}, "price": 34.96, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 15607}, "asin": "B000244F2S", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51LSoFvy1uL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Film Noir Classic Collection, Vol. 1 (The Asphalt Jungle / Gun Crazy / Murder My Sweet / Out of the Past / The Set-Up)"}

{"description": "American sitcoms usually have a bland, likable central character who has to cope with obnoxious acquaintances--who usually provide most of the actual comedy. The British smartly put the comic personalities front and center, andKeeping Up Appearanceshas one of the best: The petty, pretentious, tyrannical Hyacinth Bucket (played by the impressive Patricia Routledge), a dowdy middle-class social climber with a piercing voice and an unshakable faith in herself. Upon learning that her mailman has seven children, she declares disapprovingly, \"Quite an achievement when you have to be up so early.\" Whether she's scheming to invite a minor local celebrity to a garden party or scowling at an enormous dog left in her driveway, Hyacinth terrorizes all around her, particularly her long-suffering husband Richard (Clive Swift), who takes a small delight in subverting her efforts from time to time; her trembling neighbors Elizabeth and Emmett (Josephine Tewson and David Griffin), who scarcely leave their house lest they be invited in to coffee; and her sexually frustrated lower-class sisters Daisy and Rose (Judy Cornwell and Mary Millar) and Daisy's layabout husband Onslow (Geoffrey Hughes), who longs to be left in peace to eat chips and watch the races. Though Americans aren't as class-conscious as the Brits, snobbery is universal, and Keeping Up Appearances has developed an appreciative cult following on this side of the Atlantic.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002I9TZHA", "B0002F6BT2", "B0009S2SOY", "B002LFPAUC", "B001JV5BBC", "B0035JHYIY", "B000SINSX0", "B00007JZUC", "B000CDSS22", "B00007JZUF", "B0016RNLZW", "B001B3LIQU", "B008FTWT70", "B002BIULNA", "B00JJRLG7G", "B00AQJANI4", "B000784WKO", "B00007ELCZ", "B001B3LIPG", "B009A68ESA", "B00C2IJJGY", "B00FPPQYXM", "B001T21R6Y", "0563369752", "B002LFPAUM", "B00197YZ7C", "B001TKK3KC", "B009VYAVYG", "B00EF4U7AK", "B00KYCA4QY", "B000ERVK6W", "B00BCXVYOK", "B000A0GOIM", "B005DVIPY4", "B0035JHYJ8", "B0093I4Y3Y", "B000YIGNKY", "B005SH65FO", "B00BVMX9O0", "B00008DP4B", "B00C12ZISE", "B00008L3PB", "B00009XN37", "B004SGWYYM", "B00007JZUE", "B00A0HT99G", "B00JK47BHM", "B00F1BFRA6", "B00GD7UO4G", "B00A27O0N4", "B009DS6YGO", "B00B89X0CW", "0563371072", "B0001JXP8E", "B00AO1RKFS", "B005GP7EVC", "B004HHX9H8", "B004K4FULQ", "B000EMG91S", "B00HUAH14Q", "B0009UZG78", "B004H0ZHD4", "B0007QS28E", "B003PIUIOM", "B0010V4VK8", "B00447G2SY", "B000VDDE18", "B001V7UXG2", "B00HRUQB5O", "B0000ALPJL", "B0009NSCTY", "B008UQUS26", "B008HUSFTS", "B00EH4KOWE", "B0000E6XDU", "B004EYT8BA", "B00004Z4TO", "B00BW4S87A", "B0009S2SQ2", "B0000ALPJN", "B00IXPWGIS", "B000TGJ8B2", "B00CL0MCN0", "B00C7A8WWO", "B008B4LRMC", "B00E5G03I4", "B0028AEO0M", "B000FOQ04Q", "B006JY3OH2", "B000EOTUTE", "B000BITVAG", "B0000ALPJM", "B0000TG8UW", "B004AV5H3U", "B0006Z2L06", "B0090XLDO0", "B004EYT8EC", "B004KVXCB4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00EF4U7AK", "B002I9TZHA", "B002LFPAUC", "B000079DND"]}, "price": 89.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 56496}, "asin": "B0002F6BTC", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61NCR0WQXHL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Keeping Up Appearances: The Full Bouquet"}
{"description": "A powerful mystery that sometimes feels like a clash of titanic forces offset by a detective hero's quiet, emotional reawakening,Death in Holy Ordersis a cut above most Brit-TV sleuthing. P.D. James's renowned poet and Scotland Yard Commander Adam Dalgliesh (Martin Shaw) looks into the suffocation death of a student at the theological College of St. Anselm, a place where he spent peaceful time in boyhood. Upon his arrival, Dalgliesh finds a perfect political storm converging. The Church of England is planning to close the school after selling off its art assets, and the eager agent for this mission is an archdeacon (Clive Wood) who might have murdered his wife but definitely destroyed an Anselm priest's reputation by branding him a pedophile. Meanwhile, Dalgliesh, a reclusive widower whose wife died during childbirth, is encouraged toward a fuller life by an old mentor and an interesting woman. This is a crackling whodunit with strong psychological underpinnings. Fans of Roy Marsden's self-contained, sometimes inscrutable Dalgliesh in10 miniseriesduring the 1980s and '90s may be startled by Shaw's raw soulfulness in the role. But the latter's interpretation grows on one very quickly.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000AOEMUU", "B000A0GYN2", "B002XTBEE2", "B00199PPCO", "B004D2GMQC", "B00199PPCE", "B003TY2ST0", "B00542USL0", "B005SH65SG", "B00860YI40", "B00GWXI1F0", "B0008EN6OA", "B0008EN6MC", "B0008EN6NG", "B009DS3VQA", "B00BEZEDNU", "B0008EN6MW", "B00K6DQGC2", "B0008EN6MM", "B000XBPDY4", "B0008EN6NQ", "B007S0DEB2", "B00IK481FO", "B00GD7UO6E", "B0008EN6O0", "B00JJRLFTU", "B0008EN6N6", "B00GAXASK8", "B00J3M54AW", "B004SI5VUY", "B00331RHCM", "B00GHH9I62", "B001B43IUS", "B00HUAGYF8", "B00AATFJKC", "B002WN8IS4", "B00C12ZISE", "B00GD7UMDO", "B00BVMX4ZY", "B003O97W2I", "B00D49YBTA", "B009DS5OEM", "B009YX8MKO", "B00C888LOO", "B005SH65S6", "B0083HXKAY", "B008645ZXY", "B00GWXI2RM", "B0049S1NW8", "B000GW8U4A", "B006JY3OBI", "B004AV5H3U", "B008OTTTP6", "B0050MB3RM", "B00A8KJLPM", "B0048083KM", "B00D49YDDY", "B00EH4L3X8", "B0019QOKSM", "B009DS6YGO", "B008RO6PJQ", "B00AHREQMY", "B00H4ZEFTQ", "B00IBKXP8A", "B00662CH02", "B009D4RW96", "B004AV5H2G", "B0050N0US4", "B00D7AM2YW", "B000BRBAD8", "B000S2B21G", "B00HGE90Z4", "B00EH4KY2Y", "B00D49YESS", "B0009H97IA", "B000FDECH4", "B00D49YDR0", "B00008DDXE", "B00HHYF55C", "B006JY3OH2", "B0001WTUK8", "B005N8KP3Q", "B000EMGF3U", "B00ECXJC1E", "B00268EY5Q", "B00AQYUY5Q", "B009DS31ZG", "B007T40GRW", "B001HZ4K80", "B00GAXASKS", "B00A27OJ94", "B00BQXTCVS", "B000F4RHBG", "B0011VJRVU", "B0009H97JE", "B004RBC5LK", "B001D7T6N6", "B0028LOT7O", "B00A27O5AW", "B0001DMUF4"], "bought_together": ["B000AOEMUU", "B00199PPCO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000AOEMUU", "B0008EN6OA", "B00860YI40", "B002XTBEE2"]}, "price": 12.48, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 32262}, "asin": "B0002HOERQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/511W234Z2VL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "P.D.

But Tang and Song's ironic crime wave threatens to self-destruct after they recruit Feng, a naive young farm boy.

{"description": "Tom and Jerry, the animation franchise, lasted six decades and saw several geniuses of the form--Chuck Jones, Tex Avery, and Friz Freleng--have a hand in updating and refreshing the series in later years. ButTom and Jerry: The Spotlight Collection, Premiere Volumecelebrates the original mastery of producer-directors William Hanna and Joseph Barbera, who took the familiar cat-chases-mouse concept and slowly turned it into witty, unpredictable, and sometimes ironic entertainment.The Spotlight Collectionoffers 40 restored, remastered shorts beginning with 1943's handsome, Oscar-nominated \"Yankee Doodle Mouse\" and ending with the fantastic, widescreen 1956 \"Blue Cat Blues,\" very similar to the exaggerated look and feel of former cartoonist-gagman Frank Tashlin's live-action comedies (Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?) from the same period.What strikes one about every episode on these discs is the lavish care Hanna-Barbera paid toTom and Jerry, not only drumming up new, sometimes exotic settings (such as the swashbuckling \"The Two Mousketeers,\" or for the Old West adventure \"Texas Tom\") but also consistently turning out gorgeous and wildly creative backgrounds, where straight lines rarely exist and the palette of a night sky includes multiple, dreamy shades of blue and green. Technicolor and novel visual ideas (e.g., shooting a scene through the tunnel-like view of a hollowed-out bread loaf) are sometimes more pleasing than the combative relationship between the two leads. But their rivalry is often renewed in very interesting ways, such as the wonderful \"Tom and Jerry in the Hollywood Bowl,\" in which the pair play competing conductors against a lovely backdrop of L.A. landmarks. Special features include theAnchors Aweighdance sequence featuring Jerry and Gene Kelly, and a featurette, \"How Bill and Joe Met Tom and Jerry.\"--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000ADS61M", "B000R7GKPK", "B0000AYJXV", "B003WOW5HW", "B0058O1FIY", "B001U3N3QY", "B001TKKB1I", "B002DY9KRU", "B00007G1ZN", "B006VUYJ1E", "B0051T3H9G", "B0002VNYI2", "B000G73UPE", "B004L9GM5S", "B003CL6L2A", "B00E21QTGW", "B000MTPA5Y", "B002U4UZA4", "B0000AYJUT", "B00186DF4I", "B001MWUWUI", "B0000AYJXS", "B000PC1PAW", "B00GDEC6Z4", "B006CDK7XO", "B003U0AHGE", "B003B1X8AY", "B007KW5MJU", "B000A88EUA", "B004176JIA", "B0011XFOIS", "B00B1LM74O", "B000ZOXDK0", "B000Z7G88Q", "B001CO42CK", "B000S6LP50", "B003O97W6O", "B0095ZRYSW", "B004176JHQ", "B006VUYIW4", "B00CJ5DEP2", "B000FKO37G", "B002JOUNHK", "B00BTJTYB2", "B001J0FVZY", "B00DRU4I7G", "B000ADS62G", "B0081QE8GC", "B003IO3FL6", "B0058O1FHK", "B000ADS62Q", "B006CPFS0E", "B004ZENT78", "B000R7GKPU", "B00020SK1Y", "B005NFJAQC", "B0033XKV96", "B0072UL7D0", "B001VEF7ZM", "B001QU880M", "B001I2EQUE", "B002TCRQNG", "B0091OYRPU", "0762447907", "B0014VPFHW", "B000AOEMU0", "B00009KTYS", "B0091KHCRY", "B005LOBWA2", "B0016LUHNW", "B000HC2LGW", "B000P296AS", "B000HC2LGM", "B00AQ5901O", "B001O2UTTK", "B0001CNQUS", "B006JN86Z8", "B001RXDM22", "B000WMA722", "B001PU8N26", "B004G6FHCU", "B000VKL706", "B002H047OG", "B0006IIKSK", "B0093I9114", "B003IOOUKQ", "B000FI9OEU", "B00CB87TM6", "B001B23ED6", "B0033B5XD2", "B000AOEMUA", "B00003JRAI", "B00CB7QT50", "B00009Q4VX", "6305472408", "B000ZBEOHY", "B0046TV4CY", "B000A9QKK0", "B006UANETI"], "bought_together": ["B000ADS61M", "B000R7GKPK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0058O1FIY", "B003WOW5HW", "B000R7GKPU", "B000ADS61M"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 8625}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 29.88, "brand": "WEA", "asin": "B0002MFGCI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51YV4dXf44L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Tom and Jerry - Spotlight Collection"}
{"description": "With its campy combination of lightweight adventure and Spandex disco chic,Buck Rogers in the 25th Centuryis a nostalgic throwback to post-Star Warsopportunism. Series co-creator Glen A. Larson was incapable of originality, and former soap star Gil Gerard (in the title role) was a bland incarnation of the comic-strip hero, so the much-anticipated series premiered on September 20, 1979, with serious disadvantages. Although the two-hour pilot \"Awakening\" had tested successfully as a theatrical release, Gerard and the show's producers could never agree on a stable tone for the series, which presents Capt. William \"Buck\" Rogers as a jovial space cowboy who is accidentally time-warped from 1987 to 2491. Earth is engaged in interplanetary war following a global holocaust, and Buck's piloting skills make him an ideal starfighter recruit for the Earth Defense Directorate, where his closest colleagues are Dr. Huer (Tim O'Connor), squadron leader Col. Wilma Deering (former model Erin Gray, looking oh-so-foxy), the wisecracking robot Twiki (voiced by cartoon legend Mel Blanc), and a portable computer-brain named Dr. Theopolis, who's carried by Twiki like oversized bling-bling.The series struggled through an awkward first season, with routine plots elevated by decent special effects and noteworthy guest stars including Jamie Lee Curtis, ill-fatedPlayboyPlaymate Dorothy Stratten (appearing, with her voice dubbed over, less than a year before her tragic murder),Batmanalumnus Julie Newmar, Buster Crabbe (veteran of vintageBuck Rogersmovie serials), and several others in a show that favored vamps and vixens over credible science fiction. A full-scale overhaul resulted in a disastrous second season, but devoted fans still gravitate to Hawk (Thom Christopher), the charismatic alien \"birdman\" who was introduced with new characters and a new, space-faring search for lost tribes from Earth (with echoes of Larson's ownBattlestar Galactica). Behind-the-scenes squabbles continued, and by mid-season of 1981, NBC pulled the plug on a breezy, still-engaging series that suffered from uneasy chemistry and never realized its full potential. Existing somewhere betweenGalacticaandLost in Spacein the TV sci-fi food chain, thisBuck--with a dearth of DVD extras--now functions as a cheesy stroll down memory lane.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000W4KT9G", "B00GX7D5G0", "B003BGZ61S", "B000PFUAN2", "B006MFQ4OS", "B0000AFX64", "B001SGN1JM", "B00023BKMC", "B00005JOJP", "B00F3L8P26", "B000JLTRHW", "B00005B8UD", "B0009JE6FM", "B00BHLTIXQ", "B004EXWGJW", "B000067FP2", "B000HEWEJ4", "B005DGKBDC", "B004EXWGHY", "B00404ME2E", "B000BOH8Y6", "B003XMKU3Y", "B0009JE6G6", "B0001ZMWYG", "B0001I55SS", "B005GYXO8K", "B003H9LIU2", "B001DW2BG0", "B005UL4NH0", "B008H6GHII", "B0012IXBNC", "B000X07SQ6", "B0090F6SD4", "B002ZCY872", "B003CNQPNS", "B004VT9JLM", "B00E5G03I4", "B0006Z2KZ2", "B0007YMWGY", "B00466H3A4", "B00144P9RA", "B003W5C0TY", "B001RTCP1U", "B00264QI68", "B001CQONOA", "B0013LL2Z2", "B0002IQKAY", "B0006D3HE2", "B000PFUA9Q", "B00A04YHI2", "B003NH3X5Q", "B000BCCAEQ", "B000WLU5ZM", "B005LFQRTC", "B002KVSJ6O", "B000ELL1QC", "B006LPHY6G", "B002VA5A02", "B005G5NPD8", "B00CWX1HPA", "B0014BQR3I", "B005DKS1Z8", "B000SNUR34", "B001ECDVH2", "B000V5IP6K", "B005GYXN2M", "B001QE99BA", "B0000C23T1", "B008R65XN8", "B0049IHWYG", "B004M9ZI0C", "B00DYQ1GBE", "B000B8IA3U", "B000F7CMPE", "B002VA59ZS", "B000ION23U", "B001AQO43M", "B00080ZG2E", "B000N4RAQA", "B004VT9JMG", "B004UV3KS4", "B00005JNU5", "B003ES5JDI", "B0011FLGZQ", "B0038ZITIE", "B000TSTEMS", "B003XMKU0M", "B0001I55O2", "B000WTZ6SK", "B0036EH3UC", "B00BUDDMGU", "B001DHXT6G", "B0006UEVTA", "B00096S47G", "B00D9EJFZA", "B005EVY8NA", "B002OKK2AW", "B0014BQR38", "B000BR9SA0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005UL4NH0", "B0090F6SD4", "B00GX7D5G0", "B003BGZ61S"]}, "price": 12.98, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 31335}, "asin": "B0002MHDW4", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51FE0EDQARL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Buck Rogers in the 25th Century: The Complete Epic Series"}
{"description": "Nancy McKeon (Lifetime'sDivision) stars as Jane Berry, a Manhattan advertising executive, in this made-for-cable twist onIt's a Wonderful Life. Jane has a sleek sports car and a fabulous view of the city, but free time is in short supply. She also has a boyfriend, but the equally career-driven Richard isn't the \"settling down\" type. Her divorced mother, Frederica (Designing Women's Dixie Carter), likes to give her a hard time, while her bookstore manager father, George (The Practice's Paul Dooley), worries she works too hard. When Jane gets into a car accident on Christmas Eve, she wakes to find that she's become a stay-at-home Connecticut mom with a loving husband, Sam (Colin Firth look-alike Steven Eckholdt), and two kids. Jane explains that they have her confused with someone else, but it's actually 10 years into the future. With no way to return to the past, she goes with the flow, which means cooking, ice-skating, and feeding the homeless. Turns out she likes Sam, though she doesn't like it when Frederica accuses her of acting like \"the old Jane.\" When Sam says he loves the old Jane as much as the new one, she knows she'll be fine no matter what happens next. Best known for independent features, likeThe Ballad of Little Jo, director Maggie Greenwald transitions to the small screen with relative ease, and McKeon and Eckholdt make for a charming couple.--Kathleen C.

{"description": "Truth, identity, and responsibility are the cornerstones ofSmallville's exceptional third season. When viewers left Clark (Tom Welling) at the end ofseason 2, he was feeling his oats in Metropolis with the help of a red Kryptonite ring, but by the opening of season 3, he must return to Smallville to not only help his parents save their farm, but seek some resolution in his relationships with Lana (Kristin Kreuk) and Lex (Michael Rosenbaum), who's returned from his abandonment at the conclusion of the previous season. Lex himself must deal with some shocking revelations regarding his relationship with his sinister father Lionel (John Glover, magnetic as always), and Lana becomes involved with a new figure in town, the mysterious Adam Knight (Lost's Ian Somerholder), who may or may not be a certain caped crusader. And speaking of heroes in disguise, the season's finale introduces Kara, a young woman with powers similar to Clark's--could she in fact be his sister, known best to comic book fans as Supergirl? Season 3 is chock full of such intriguing moments, including an appearance by futureDaily Planeteditor Perry White (Michael McKean, the real-life husband of series star Annette O'Toole) in \"Perry,\" helmed bySupergirlfilm director Jeannot Szwarc; the return of villains Jonathan Taylor Thomas, Shawn Ashmore, and Jesse Metcalfe from seasons 1 and 2 (in \"Asylum\"); the departure of series regular Samuel L. Jones; and a intrigue-fraught final turn by Christopher Reeve as Dr. Swann (\"Legacy\").The boxed set matches the high quality of the season with some terrific extras, including commentary on three episodes by series creators Alfred Gough and Miles Millar, along with Rosenbaum, Allison Mack (Chloe), and Glover. Gough and Millar also contribute commentary to a battery of deleted scenes, and Mack's \"Chloe Chronicles\" returns for another go-round. The supplemental features are rounded out by a behind-the-scenes featurette, an amusing gag reel, and an Easter egg with Rosenbaum conducting some offbeat interviews.--Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0009A5MUO", "B0001JXPPC", "B000G1R4SO", "B000N6SE4U", "B000X5SMXY", "B00005JLKB", "B001FB4VZS", "B002JVWRDQ", "B003L77GG0", "B006CR2ON6", "B000R206FK", "B001FB4W02", "B0012U7IWU", "B002JVWRE0", "B003L77GGA", "B00G4SCOJW", "B00080ZG2O", "B00G4SCKAK", "B00BBXSPCK", "B00BBXSPES", "B00BGI086Q", "B00260HH30", "B000BT96EG", "B000P6XQ50", "B004EXNHO0", "B00DTRR43W", "B001DJLD2G", "B002N5N5MK", "B00DX88IL4", "B004PHSTTS", "B000FP2OPY", "B00G7QPX6C", "B0018CWEYY", "B000J10EQU", "1419826670", "B000PE0G0A", "B00JF5G8WU", "B0000640T0", "B00CN009Y2", "B001FB4W0C", "B002DQL34G", "B00F4FFO8E", "B00280LZAE", "B000EHSVM8", "B00915G6OE", "B0049IHWYG", "B001MVWRNE", "B0041QSZ7O", "B005SH63HO", "B000SMNL92", "B008JFUPFI", "B000X5SPBI", "B002FGUHBE", "B009LDCXNY", "B005PYKVRI", "B004SEUIWY", "B00ED2IBXE", "B00066FBQQ", "B00K7IPFSM", "B0051SFSAS", "B00915G6SU", "B000BT96FA", "B000HLDF9U", "B000F8O2P6", "B000A5046K", "B000O77SMW", "B0019LY5IM", "B000F8O2OW", "B00915G6TE", "B00EIL7E9C", "B003L77GGK", "B000R7GKQE", "B00B5J6A7W", "B00K7IPGS6", "B004LROMWU", "B00DYEN6XC", "B00023E88U", "B003ITZBVS", "B000B8384G", "B000CCBC9O", "B000I0QLS2", "B009LDD626", "B0025KVKDE", "B001C8W7EQ", "B00GTZWUPS", "B0002CX1M0", "B001MVWRN4", "1401210600", "B004HW7JNS", "1401234860", "B00IYRLUAU", "B00JPS6A3O", "B0072OFM28", "B004EPZ084", "B002JVWRAO", "B00915G6NK", "B00BEJL6JK", "B00JPS7HOA", "B005QET8FS", "B00CPEK3NI"], "bought_together": ["B0009A5MUO", "B0001JXPPC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0001JXPPC", "B0009A5MUO", "B000N6SE4U", "B000G1R4SO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 10632}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 29.69, "brand": "WEA", "asin": "B0002Y0QV2", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51FG3cFcvQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Smallville: Season 3"}

{"description": "The first two episodes of this BBC miniseries only hint at the delights  to come. A lawsuit aimed at church reform in the town of Barchester forces  a decent middle-aged clergyman (the august Donald Pleasence, best known in  the U.S. for theHalloweenmovies) into a moral crisis and a  conflict with his son-in-law, a pompous archdeacon (Nigel Hawthorne,The Madness of King George). The gracefully written and acted  narrative shows glimpses of dry wit--but in episode 3, the arrival of  a new bishop (Clive Swift,Keeping Up Appearances), his imperious  wife (Geraldine McEwan,The Magdalene Sisters), and his devious  chaplain (Alan Rickman,Truly Madly Deeply, theHarry Pottermovies) launchesThe Barchester Chroniclesinto a satirical power  struggle all the more mesmerizing because of the smallness of the  territory. The scheming of the citizens and clergy of this British town is  both Byzantine and wonderfully comic as the tempestuous personalities claw  and dig at each other.Rickman, in one of his first film or television roles, turns in a tour de  force of oily ambition. McEwan's ferocious machinations are downright  terrifying, while the sputtering Hawthorne (The Madness of King  George) seems constantly in danger of bursting a vein. At the center  of it all is Pleasence. Making goodness compelling has always been  difficult, since wickedness is always more dramatic; but Pleasence brings  a deep and stirring passion to his role that proves as engaging as all the  back-biting that surrounds him. And these are just the more familiar  faces; a host of lesser-known actors give equally superb performances. The  final episode (of seven) will have you on pins and needles.The  Barchester Chronicles, adapted from two novels by Anthony Trollope, is  one of those marvels of British television, a skillful production that  proves intelligent fare can be hugely entertaining.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00065GVIO", "B00005YUNK", "B000M2E32M", "B00005JOA0", "B000784WNQ", "B000EBD9VC", "B00DW5ILF6", "B00664AM02", "B000R7HY00", "B0000AQS3P", "B004JMSIQS", "B0007P0XA0", "B0009PVZM8", "B000GIXLUC", "B0009PVZL4", "B005T0OY5S", "B0013NAMLK", "B000A8AXXG", "B000E0ODZE", "B009L2EW5W", "B0024F08Q0", "B000089QEM", "B004JMSIVI", "B00007149J", "B001P807RC", "B008UQUS26", "6305835551", "B000G6BM0K", "B0002S648C", "B002XTBEDI", "B000E8JNQU", "B00062IZ0Y", "B00HUAGZ34", "B001A7GODO", "B007A2O3FO", "B000V1OUPE", "B00018WENM", "B005GP7ELW", "B00HUAGYF8", "B000AYEL6U", "B0080QOL10", "B006MQ0ERK", "B003CP1T50", "B0007LFPJ8", "B00BQXTDIU", "B007701RFS", "B00140PK6O", "B000Z27HLS", "B000PFUA7S", "B00IK481FO", "B00H4ZEFTQ", "B002XTBECY", "B00006HAZH", "B009T6CXG0", "0767812115", "B000M2E32C", "B001LPWGBY", "B0012OVCE6", "B000EMGF2Q", "B001GJ4U5A", "B00EF0NVGQ", "B00BMQODEU", "B00HHYF548", "B007ISJS1O", "B00A8KJMP6", "B00F3TD8QQ", "0199537658", "B0019BI1FA", "B00F1BFRA6", "B00GOC756A", "B00005OOQ2", "B00005R5GK", "B0009PVZIW", "B00141188M", "B0012IV3Q4", "B001PU8N0I", "B00BCXW106", "B004FM2EL2", "B00FPPQYXM", "B000FQIRYA", "0140432132", "B000QXDCWY", "B0074FUSFG", "B000BITVAG", "6302409772", "B00003CXSA", "B00006RJ63", "B001PU8O5W", "B00D7AM2WO", "B0046ZYEUW", "B00067BCBI", "B00BCXVYOK", "B0083HXKMC", "B00HUAH14Q", "B003WEAW18", "B000WVPXAO", "B000FQIRXQ", "B001JXPC7S", "B0001ZWY6W", "B004K4FUUC"], "bought_together": ["B000784WNQ", "B00005JOA0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000BNTMKK", "B00DW5ILF6", "B000M2E32M", "B00065GVIO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 31768}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 17.7, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00065GX96", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Zrn6879xL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Barchester Chronicles"}

{"description": "On the evening of December 11, 1936, England's King Edward VIII formally broadcast his farewell to a nation. Torn between duty and love, he had decided to follow his heart. A powerful fairytale made all the more compelling because it actually happened, EDWARD & MRS. SIMPSON captures the unforgettable romance that develops between the Prince of Wales and an extraordinary American woman named Wallis Simpson. That she is already married and believed to have had previous affairs ruffles more than a few feathers. The scandal heats up when the Prince becomes King and declares his intention to marry his mistress, who has since divorced and become quite available. A critically acclaimed British mini-series from 1978 finally available on DVD, EDWARD & MRS.

{"description": "The film is set in France near the end of World War I in the deadly trenches of the Somme, in the gilded Parisien halls of power, and in the modest home of an indomitable provincial girl. It tells the story of this young woman's relentless, moving and sometimes comic search for her fiancC)e, who has disappeared. He is one of five French soldiers believed to have been court-martialed under mysterious circumstances and pushed out of an allied trench into an almost-certain death in no-man's land. What follows is an investigation into the arbitrary nature of secrecy, the absurdity of war, and the enduring passion, intuition and tenacity of the human heart.DVD Features:Audio CommentaryDeleted Scenes:With Director audio commentaryDocumentaries:Paris in the 20'sThe Zepplin ExplosionFeaturette:The Making of A Very Long EngagementTheatrical Trailer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001CIOCLC", "B0045NXMJE", "B004YCKKH8", "B000934FC2", "B00000K3TS", "B004SEUIXS", "B008H1Q3QY", "B00005JM48", "B002LE8MGW", "B00005JPX8", "B0000C9JFO", "B002VKB0M4", "B00EMAGJ68", "B000UVV26A", "B001THZAAI", "B0069UV0AY", "B000YPUFBA", "B002AG2NTI", "B0045NXMMQ", "B0087IT8FK", "B001AZJKKK", "B004ZG5EYC", "B000B58DHQ", "B00421IR5I", "B005V4X8PO", "B000063K0U", "B00BTYJYR6", "B007I1Q59E", "B000I6BJ56", "B00000F7E6", "B00A92MEJY", "B0042FDCR2", "B000HIVIQU", "B009CSVQ8Q", "B000811672", "0312424582", "B0019UGYAU", "B0009P7EI2", "B00275EHVE", "B005E7SEK2", "B00EV1YZKK", "B004B3254Q", "B002BWP3UC", "B003VA3JTA", "B001M72J68", "B0002S64SM", "B000GBEWP2", "B0080QOL6A", "B000BB18WC", "B000OVLBGC", "B009B8YMB0", "B0036TGSJE", "B000LW7L2M", "B00DPJEWDO", "0792841409", "B00GS08Y3Q", "B000B9EYFW", "B0002ZMJD4", "B00068S3QY", "B00K0MM4AM", "B004YCKKIM", "B000SSQ7JC", "B0051HCVEU", "B005MYEQ4U", "B00005B1WH", "B00003CWTI", "B001JV5BA8", "B0031REQKE", "B00007J5VT", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B003J7HO6E", "B00GPPXNIK", "B002WY65VA", "B004XVMCG2", "B000YDMPAQ", "B00EV1YZQE", "B004SIP6BI", "B000HWZ4I4", "B00AZNEVNE", "B0001I54QQ", "B001CITQWC", "B00AZNEVJ8", "B00GX7WUD4", "B000KGGJ0Y", "B000H5V8H2", "B00ARX2VZW", "B00INUK5WM", "B00009OOFG", "B00F6SHGF8", "B00ENMZK1A", "B0011FDVGI", "B009TT0BSE", "B000CBG5PG", "B0014FAIZC", "B0046YK4KW", "B000N3T0DW", "B004EI2NUO", "B00003CXXY", "B004UXUUDA", "B002U1LGSW"], "bought_together": ["B001CIOCLC", "B004SEUIXS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001CIOCLC", "B004SEUIXS", "B0000C9JFO", "B00005JPX8"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 18840}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.74, "brand": "Warner Brothers", "asin": "B0007Z0NYQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51uMf%2BoLZPL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "A Very Long Engagement"}

In fact, Lizzie is writing those missives, but she is faced with a challenge when Frankie discovers his father's ship will dock nearby. Lizzie hires a kind, handsome stranger (Gerard Butler) to play Frankie's dad, creating an odd situation in which ever-growing lies become a conduit for love, and Lizzie's repressed desires come to the fore with a man posing as her husband. The moral tangles are of interest in director Shona Auerbach's charmingly paced, quietly insightful drama-comedy, but so is the glorious feeling of watching these characters come fully alive.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00A2H9UG6", "B000GIXEIG", "B005FITIDC", "B00027NVXE", "B00007AJF4", "B000WP07F6", "B002ZG998G", "B002P413IC", "B000G8P1Y6", "B000YAA68C", "B000V8VNUM", "B00AEBB8QK", "B001M4YZ90", "B0059XTUR2", "B00AAQHP66", "B00003CXSD", "B001D7WF98", "B002XMGGK6", "B002SG7Z7A", "B004R6VHQY", "B004XYOQU4", "B001APZMJS", "B00009XN4C", "B00AEFYGBA", "B000FQISV2", "B00094AS9U", "B0007TKNII", "B0038N9X3Q", "B00BEIYHO2", "B00946G2YE", "B000OY9V8Y", "B00A2H9VBU", "B005FITIF0", "B003LL3FIY", "B000811672", "B00006JDVV", "B00008DDVT", "B005CFC0HE", "B00GSBMNOQ", "B000XS3WWW", "B004IY6A0S", "B00GPWEPZ8", "B00G15MDI0", "B00CBK6506", "B001APZMJ8", "B00006JU8B", "B000QXDED6", "B004SIP7PS", "B0000714BW", "B007A2O3FO", "B007K7IBTI", "B003HDYOTU", "B000GYI048", "B0000C2IR4", "B0009A1BW2", "B000A2W1X2", "B0015GDVTU", "B000NJWIPI", "0767020308", "B0009UZGIM", "B003SC9AVC", "B00EOHGQPI", "B00AQTY3XA", "B000654YWY", "B00AZMFO6I", "B000NVT0T8", "B002OVED88", "B0009G3BCY", "B00FZ4KR4U", "B0059XTUT0", "B0067EKY7M", "B00006ZXSO", "B0000UJLTG", "B0053Q9DHW", "B0002W18RU", "B00G7QPXAI", "B000HRMATU", "B00DL48BM6", "B00G6HO368", "B004SIP6BI", "B00BEIYGK2", "B000Z27HLS", "B002ZG988M", "B00104AYFQ", "B0040J1RZE", "B005S9EJ14", "B000P5FH26", "B000JLQQ7Q", "B00005JPSM", "B005PTMPYA", "B00GST8LMG", "B004KDYQXU", "B008N25XAE", "B000VKL6T8", "6305558205", "B0002V7S34", "B00008HC9B", "B000IJ7A24", "B00JAQJMJ0"], "bought_together": ["B00A2H9UG6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0007TKNII", "B00A2H9UG6", "B001APZMJS", "B000YAA68C"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 17921}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.14, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B00094AS9A", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51igVNYqynL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Dear Frankie"}

{"description": "Fans ofIce Princesswill enjoy seeing the five deleted scenes, even though like most DVD deleted scenes they wouldn't have added much to the film.  In fact, the alternate opening (an extended scene that flashes back to Casey's earlier childhood) and a later scene would have undesirably softened Joan Cusack's and Kim Cattrall's characters.  Some cut scenes involving Casey and her Snoplow classmates are fun.  The two music videos spotlight key songs from the soundtrack, Caleigh Peters's \"Reach\" and Ally & AJ's \"No One,\" but co-star Hayden Panettiere's \"I Fly\" is a curious omission.  The commentary track follows the Disney trend of featuring its young actors, in this case Michelle Trachtenberg (Casey), Panettiere (Gen), Trevor Blumas (Teddy), and Kirsten Olsen (Nikki, the \"Jumping Shrimp\").  Film aficionados won't learn that much about the crafting of the movie, but the kids have spirit and talk about the \"exploding butt shot\" and who already knew how to skate.  It can be a little tricky to figure which girl is speaking, though.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002WY65V0", "B004CYVZ4K", "B000CCBCAI", "B0007US7C6", "B00005JMCW", "B00063KGPU", "B0024NSFYO", "B00795C5X4", "B000059XTL", "B000FCW15A", "B003B1X85O", "B00005JM9Q", "B00404ME2Y", "B0006SSMWE", "B000209KMW", "B003Y5H52O", "B001B7CO0K", "6305870179", "B000F48D5A", "B004SIP75S", "B00AEFYWQY", "B006X08DZ0", "B000AM4P9A", "B000H5V8CW", "B000324Y98", "B004QIG7CW", "B0001Z3HIG", "B001725ZD2", "B001R3YRIU", "B007I8KXDQ", "B0007LXPBI", "B000B2YR92", "B00005JPO4", "B00062IVN0", "B000ICM5SU", "B0009DWL8W", "B000VAPZM2", "B003PGNBNY", "B0007LXPBS", "B006JTS6XY", "B001KX50B0", "B001NE80P4", "B002WNU0QM", "B000FVQM4W", "B002WNU0OY", "044047731X", "B001G2S3Y6", "B000Y9PC7S", "B002GOAH1U", "B001GC9VK6", "B00GOITWRE", "B0007Z9R66", "B000F2BNW2", "B000JMK6OO", "B007DBGS4G", "B00005JN0Z", "B001FCD252", "B002BIULQ2", "B004IZVMXM", "B000CDSS0Y", "B0006GAOCW", "B00005JMXO", "6305428387", "B0009HLBQQ", "B0007Z9R5W", "B00004Y7D2", "B0013ND3MK", "B00005V9I9", "B004FXQYG2", "B00FKXBECU", "B001H1I8KK", "B000LXHFNG", "B001AR012O", "B001TUZD8O", "B000065V42", "B005EJIG62", "B004FJ87EI", "B000MBUXEA", "B00ANV82HE", "B000JFY05W", "B003NHRIVQ"], "bought_together": ["B000CCBCAI", "B004CYVZ4K"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001S3C0M4", "B000CCBCAI", "B00005JMCW", "B000FCW15A"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 22973}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.99, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B0009JE57G", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ESDWWN2SL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Ice Princess (Full Screen Edition)"}

As the knife is raised to take his life, Pocahontas, a Powhatan princess SANDRINE HOLT (Rapa Nui and Black Robe) speaks.

Her act of love stirs the anger of her tribesmen, and in the eyes of the English, particularly his enemy, Sir Edwin Wingfield, TONY GOLDWYN (Ghost and The Pelican Brief), John Smith is a traitor.

{"description": "Whoever persuaded MGM to make a movie about giant, bloodthirsty bunnies must have been some kind of mad genius.Night of the Lepusfeatures Stuart Whitman (star of such classics asOmega CopandDemonoid, Messenger of Death) and Janet Leigh (whose career had taken a downturn fromPsycho) as a pair of scientists who say things like \"I wish I knew what the effects of this serum would be--let's hope it works\" as they inject test rabbits with hormones that turn them into slavering, carnivorous giant bunnies. That's the plot; the rest of the movie is scenes of giant bunnies attacking horses, giant bunnies jumping through windows to attack people, giant bunnies running in herds down the freeway...lots and lots of giant bunnies, sometimes with blood smeared across their ferocious jaws as they rear up to attack. The special effects are breathtakingly cheap; the bloody corpses are actors with red syrup splashed over them. But what makesNight of the Lepuseven more astonishing is that the dvd features dubbing in French, presumably for European viewers bored with their usual diet of Truffaut and Rohmer. In fact, the movie makes more sense in French (assuming you don't actually speak the language); you can pretend it was created by an inspired Surrealist, and that Janet Leigh says things like \"My bicycle has wheels of cheese\" or \"Beauty kisses my savage earlobe,\" instead of \"Rabbits aren't exactly Roy's bag.\" Also starring Rory Calhoun (Roller Blade Warriors: Taken by Force) and DeForest Kelley (Dr. McCoy on the originalStar Trek), who wears several colorful turtlenecks.

{"description": "The Man with the Screaming Brain is cult superstar Bruce Campbell (Evil Dead 2), who also makes his directorial debut in this loopy blend of '50s-style science fiction thrills and slapstick comedy. Campbell plays a businessman who meets an untimely end at the hands of a vicious Gypsy femme fatale, who has also done in her ex-fianc&eacute;e, an KGB-agent-turned-taxi-driver. Mad doctor Stacy Keach provides a solution for both men by stitching together their brains inside Campbell's dome; with no other option but to work together, the pair sent out to find their killer. What results is a broadly funny and frantic showcase for Campbell's physical comedy skills, with Ted Raimi (Spider-Man,Xena) offering hilarious support as Keach's wacky assistant. Campbell fanatics will appreciate the DVD's extras, which include a featurette on the film's lengthy gestation (18 years  from conception to completion), and commentary by Campbell and producer David Goodman; a trailer, behind-the-scenes footage, and storyboards round out the supplemental features.--Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000WC38FA", "B001KEGR5M", "B001KEGR5W", "B0001LQJMQ", "B000FJH5MC", "B000F7CMPE", "B000IJ7A5Q", "B001C0PFG6", "0312291450", "B005J9ZFQG", "B000WC3864", "0783227434", "031231261X", "B001KEGR7U", "B0016MJ6P6", "B0007WQHI0", "B0000ALPFL", "B005FRWU5Q", "B004ZBFRG2", "B0009JE6FM", "B0001US7OA", "B00IA1VQBS", "B005J9ZE5I", "B0058I9DZM", "B00004Z1GI", "B004GGU9K0", "B0025VLEMK", "B00L326LTI", "B00IF8Q0YE", "0312312601", "0312242646", "B003Z8ZC2U", "B0002C9DK4", "B00J0IQISG", "157362408X", "B00404ME2E", "B00C6F61IW", "B00HI9QDQ6", "B001BP14MG", "B002EOVXBK", "B000H5TH0W", "B008DVJNTW", "B008DVJOQ4", "B000HT3SA8", "B00F3L8P26", "6305428263", "B00CERJJ68", "B00HNTOVX8", "B0009KQP3C", "B00JHH1VSW", "B00FUABJJQ", "B00009YXHN", "B00026L7OU", "B0000E6FOO", "0783228457", "B00C0EQWRY", "B00005JOJP", "B004GGU9JQ", "B008B089RM", "B004EXWGJW", "B001Q8MMC4", "B0029RW0E6", "B001221DUQ", "B000068IEV", "B000099T3M", "B00DI012QA", "B000FS9FE4", "B005S2F8LQ", "B003BGZ61S", "B001AR0D5Y", "B00BXHDZ5Q", "B000H7JCFK", "B009IV2Z3M", "B000G6BLGK", "B0002V7TMY", "B002I41KNC", "B005NKIPUO", "B0088FS27C", "B0053TWW36", "B004BZ5AN2", "0790742004", "B00000IXPN", "B003IRUFCA", "B008JFUO0Y", "B00GHH9IIA", "B0007WFXNA", "B0000694WL", "B006LPHY5C", "B002T4GY3C", "B000068TPD", "B0000DC12T", "B000EOTV98", "B001AGNMFI", "6305258287", "B000SFJ4K4", "B008HSK3PE", "B007XF0XUW", "B00B0LKVIY", "B0091G7BTM", "B000274TLW"], "bought_together": ["B000WC38FA", "B001KEGR5M"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000F7CMPE", "B001KEGR5M", "B0001LQJMQ", "B005J9ZFQG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 51954}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.0, "brand": "", "asin": "B000AQ69QS", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61WYTKE0D4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Man with the Screaming Brain"}

{"description": "Life without parental supervision or an annoying younger sister seems like a dream come true to Drake and Josh inDrake and Josh Go Hollywood, but the reality of being on their own in the real world proves much more difficult than either teenager could possibly imagine.   Drake and Josh anticipate 10 days of doing exactly what they want when their parents leave town for a cruise and their sister Megan heads for Colorado to see a friend.  Unfortunately, Drake and Josh mistakenly put Megan on a flight bound for Los Angeles and then feel compelled to jump on the next flight to try to catch her.  After an eventful flight, the pair tracks her down at an exclusive hotel, manages to worm their way into a live-feed concert opportunity for Drake's band on MTV's hot \"TRL\"  television program, and somehow finds themselves mixed up in a money-printing scam that endangers both Drake's and Josh's life.  Can a couple of teenagers and their little sister outsmart these seasoned crooks and manage to get to the studio in time for Drake's all-important band gig?

Abandoned at an early age, Oliver Twist (Barney Clark) is forced to live in a workhouse lorded over by the awful Mr. Bumble, who cheats the boys of their meager rations. Desperate yet determined, Oliver makes his escape to the streets of London. Penniless and alone, he is lured into a world of crime by the sinister Fagin (Academy-Award(r) winner Sir Ben Kingsley) -- the mastermind of a gang of pint-sized pickpockets.

{"description": "A decade after their last hilarious short, the Oscar-winningA Close Shave, Claymation wonders Wallace and Gromit return for a full-length adventure. Daffy scientist Wallace (voiced by Peter Sallis) and his heroic dog Gromit are doing well with their business, Anti-Pesto, a varmint-hunting outfit designed to keep their English town safe from rabbits chomping on prized vegetables. Wallace meets Lady Tottington (Helena Bonham Carter), who appreciates Wallace's humane way of dealing with rabbits (courtesy of the Bun-Vac 6000), and sets up a rivalry with the gun-toting Victor Quartermaine (Ralph Fiennes, enjoying himself more than ever). Creator Nick Park, with co-director/writer Steve Box, delivers a story worthy of the 85-minute running time, although it stretches the act a bit; the formula plays better shorter, but the literally hand-crafted film is a joy to watch. Taking a chapter from classic horror films, a giant were-rabbit is soon on the prowl, and the town is up in arms, what with the annual vegetable contest close at hand. (Anyone who's seen the previous three shorts knows who saves the day.) Never content to do something simply when the extravagant will do, W&G;'s lives are filled with whimsical Rude Goldberg-style devices, and the opening number showcasing their alarm system is pure Aardman Animation at its finest. Even though there's a new twist here--a few mild sight gags aimed at adults--this G-rated film will delight young and old alike as Park, like team Pixar, seems incapable of making anything but an outstanding film.--Doug ThomasSee more clay animation and Wallace &amp; Gromit titles...Director Nick Park on DVDStop-Motion &amp; Clay Animation TitlesWallace &amp; GromitStuff Galore", "related": {"also_bought": ["B006W4KVI4", "B002DPVI0Q", "B001LXIDTK", "B00003CXJ4", "B001LXIDTA", "B001LXIDT0", "B002DR2GJQ", "B000M343BC", "B000W089WO", "B001OC6RZA", "B001F0TT8I", "B004AGN9MG", "B000AA4JNE", "B002ZG4QDE", "B000A2UBOI", "B003BJODIC", "B004KV93AI", "B00005JNQS", "B000H7JCK0", "B0072GOJ48", "B006W4KRRY", "B002WJI2QQ", "B0012EM5D8", "B002D755B2", "B0006JMLRK", "B0000640SC", "B004ZQJ5FQ", "B001DPHDCY", "0783231474", "6305161887", "B000MV9026", "B0034G4P26", "B001ECQ75A", "B0045I3EQA", "B000BITUVG", "B005FNLUFQ", "B000ION23A", "B007Z2DO0E", "B003XEKXWK", "B004HO6I4M", "B001GCUO7A", "B003TJM60G", "B000AY74OG", "B003E66Y84", "B00000JL8E", "B00005JMQZ", "B00009M9BK", "B000DWMYQ8", "B00003CXG7", "B0000AK7AB", "B00029LO0Y", "B0001906W2", "B0006UEVT0", "B00CWM58WY", "B000RMJ4F8", "B002ZG97YM", "B0019BI11E", "B0052MXJ3Q", "B0034G4P1W", "B000MNOX9E", "B004EPZ034", "B00DBVHHDS", "B00I6JOD2S", "B005LAIHW2", "B000IFRT2O", "B005F96UJ6", "1782760326", "B0039N74CW", "B0045ZAQS2", "B000BB1MI2", "B000UVKGPI", "B0030ZIZRC", "B000C3L27U", "B001PR0YEE", "B003UAKE9Y", "B005SDUV4E", "B001HN6918", "B003RHZ6IE", "B001FTIJS0", "B0013FSL3E", "B00CO9N6CY", "B000VBJEEG", "B00009YXAW", "B0015XWUAY", "B00AEFYXD6", "B00007LVCM", "B0034GK74G", "B0042U94UQ", "B00CHVJODE", "B00008G8LM", "B00A8KJK7G", "B000G75AZC", "B00005JN4W", "B000ROAK2W", "B005LAII62", "B00E00OGE2", "B007J3ISKK", "6305123454"], "bought_together": ["B00003CXJ4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0044RFTBA", "B002DPVI0Q", "B00I0VTOMG", "B001LXIDTA"]}, "price": 5.0, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 5628}, "asin": "B000CZ0PT4", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61MzjQMqG%2BL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Wallace &amp; Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit (Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "For such a quiet and understated movie,Loggerheadshas a lot of ambition: In addition to being a gay love story, it's also about the push and pull between parents and children, the hairline fractures in a marriage, and the delicate balance of a neighborhood. A troubled woman (Bonnie Hunt,Return to Me) seeks out the child she gave up for adoption; a gay motel owner (Michael Kelly,Dawn of the Dead) takes in a handsome drifter (Kip Pardue,Imaginary Heroes); and the wife (Tess Harper,Tender Mercies) of a preacher (Chris Sarandon,The Princess Bride) frets that a gay couple has moved in across the street. All of their lives will intersect asLoggerheadssubtly draws out their secret losses and desires. Maybe too subtly--trying to avoid melodrama, the movie may have avoided some emotionally potent scenes. But the cast is superb throughout, all giving vivid and genuine performances; there's not a false note through the entire film.

{"description": "Northern Exposure - The Complete First SeasonWhether it's a snowy nude sprint down Main Street, the mysterious appearance of a long-lost relative, or the improbable death of yet another of Maggie's boyfriends, life's never dull in the remote hamlet of Cicely, Alaska. Colorful characters and quirky plots propelledNorthern Exposureinto the hearts of millions of viewers, earning the CBS \"dramedy\" series seven Emmy awards between its 1990 debut and its demise six seasons later. In season 1, we meet Dr. Joel Fleischman (Rob Morrow), an urban New York yuppie who consents to four years of rural servitude after Alaska pays his medical-school tuition. Joel's fish-out-of-water adventures drive the show, but it's the quirky ensemble of characters--Chris, the DJ/philosopher (John Corbett), Holling, the bartender (John Cullum), Maurice, the town patriarch (Barry Corbin), Ed, the filmmaker (Darren E. Burrows), and Maggie, the bush pilot (Janine Turner), among others&#x96;-that keeps the series consistently entertaining. The town develops its own offbeat personality as well, a Mayberry-meets-Twin-Peaks blend of Native mysticism, Aurora Borealis-induced dreams, unlikely tales of long-lost family members, and rumors of a Bigfoot-like creature known simply as \"Adam.\"Northern Exposureprovides a utopian escape--a place where life is interesting but never dangerous, everyone's insightful, the mystical becomes real, and nobody's burdened with a mundane 9-to-6 desk job. Cicely is a delightful place to visit, even if it's only for an hour at a time.  A mid-season replacement, season 1 consists of just eight episodes on two DVDs. Each episode includes 5-10 minutes of outtakes and deleted scenes.--Shane BurnettNorthern Exposure - The Complete Second SeasonThe colorful cast of characters from Cicely, Alaska, returns for a new set of adventures inNorthern Exposure: The Complete Second Season. While much of the first season was devoted to establishing the plot, each of the seven episodes in season 2 helps us to know the offbeat ensemble of Cicely residents a little better. Dr. Joel Fleischman (Rob Morrow), the New York urbanite stationed in small-town Alaska to pay off his medical-school tuition, still complains constantly about his assignment, but it's clear the town's growing on him when he passes up an opportunity to return home (if only temporarily). We learn from town patriarch Maurice (Barry Corbin) that retired astronauts have groupies, and when a beautiful woman steals the voice of DJ \"Chris in the Morning\" (John Corbett), it's no huge surprise when the long-deceased spirit of \"One Who Waits\" provides Chris with an ancient Indian cure.But it's the chemistry between Joel and Maggie (Janine Turner) that really makes the series sizzle. The season is book-ended by a pair of breakups that leave first Joel, and then Maggie single, clearing the way for the romance to come in later seasons. The season includes \"Spring Break,\" one of the best-loved episodes from the series. With the impending arrival of spring, libidos run amok, a wave of petty crime hits the town, and the men in town blow off steam au naturale in the annual \"Running of the Bulls.\"Season 2's packaging and extras are virtually identical to those from season 1. The two-disc set comes sheathed in a collectible mini zippered nylon \"parka,\" and each episode includes deleted scenes and bloopers. There are no retrospectives or interviews with cast and crew, and no printed materials accompany the discs.--Shane Burnett", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00FWMVVK4", "B00FWMVVI6", "B00FWMVVKY", "B00FWMVVHC", "B000002OMG", "1417029854", "B000002OT2", "B000K7VHJ6", "0809237628", "B000V6LSO0", "0809237601", "B00DSCB7Q8", "B0017KP8Y0", "B006WK4Y6I", "B000TGURZ8", "B00005JOXR", "B000BGR1B4", "B00EQ2KU7G", "B00369ERC4", "B001DHXT52", "B000NDEXO8", "B006WK4Y8Q", "B000NTMA1U", "B001U9BS2O", "B0055733I4", "B001DMVZJ4", "B000MEYKA0", "B00D2UMHVA", "B004O9WK9W", "B0013LRKQC", "B000EOTUTE", "B0035JHYQG", "B000UX6THK", "B001D2WUDE", "B00GOC74QG", "B001JFKWE4", "B000BF0C8E", "B000EQ5UUA", "B0013LRKVC", "B0013XZ6TI", "B000ERVJKO", "B000XJD3K2", "1435458443", "B000HT3P56", "B000AP31KQ", "B00A92ME5S", "B000LE16XA", "B008FTWT70", "B001DJLCRC", "B001F7AQDS", "B00GHH9HW2", "B000244E2O", "B000053VB4", "B00004ZEU2", "B003YLM78U", "B001CQONNQ", "B0016OMFO8", "B008KEQLZ6", "B000XCZGW2", "B000Q6GUS4", "B000LXGXY8", "B0058EE6NK", "B001BN4WK4", "B000N2HD6O", "B005BUA1JY", "B00A27O0N4", "B001RTSPVY", "B00I4581F4", "B00008KA5A", "B00IFK7OFG", "B000H7JCJQ", "B00FPPQYXM", "B000EHRVOW", "B00BUWD7Y8", "B0077PAPD8", "B009LDD1X0", "B000YKYT1M", "1569759766", "B000BZISRG", "B00E3QJ8DC", "B000MXPE6U", "B000PGUT8C", "B0092QH902", "B00BUWD7E8", "B001XRLWPQ", "B001E6JC30", "B00F1BFRA6", "B000NA21YA", "B00GLT2TR6", "B000B91N3S", "B00CL151G4", "B0002DRDY6", "B00DYQ1G78", "B00BM2JVAA", "B0000AQS0F"], "bought_together": ["B00FWMVVK4", "B00FWMVVI6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B006WK4Y6I", "B006WK4Y8Q", "B00FWMVVK4", "B00FWMVVI6"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 23298}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 32.99, "brand": "UNI DIST CORP.

It was a big leap for me.\"The show, taped at the Paramount Theater in Madison Square Garden and winner of the 1992 CableACE Award, is a perfect blend of biting social commentary and more gently-observed observational pieces.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0002I848K", "B001D5C1FI", "B00007G1WZ", "B00007G1WT", "B000K7VL4C", "B00005LQ0L", "B00007G1WV", "B0009OL8GC", "B00007G1WR", "B00005LQ0M", "B00BEZDHUK", "B00007G1WP", "B00005LQ0K", "B001FRNB94", "B00006HAVX", "B001D5F2LS", "B0036VHJ5Y", "B00009WVOW", "B00005LQ0J", "B000095J1K", "B000FL7CBE", "B000803BPS", "B000LC52DC", "B000077VQ6", "B00D6I7GM8", "B001HB1JY2", "B002DQSKLK", "B003X3BY8I", "B002UPQ1TW", "B0004Z33FK", "B000KG4BTU", "B0000399WN", "B00HRJVHM2", "B00000JWVS", "B001CCPRVW", "B001BEK88I", "B00005LQ0O", "B00005LQ0N", "B0002B15I8", "B0046ZYEUC", "0786883219", "B000P6R6Y2", "B008AYH4F2", "B001QU9RT8", "B0002XEEAM", "B004B93RC4", "B003BJO8I2", "B0006FO5M8", "B00JA3RVG4", "B002GHHHBK", "B000031EGO", "B001VFM5ZG", "B001G9LV5W", "B0009VRHLU", "B0000C237Y", "B00026L9BQ", "B00AEFXUFS", "B006MHZH5I", "B00DZSPP2C", "B004GIIHYI", "B003G715ZS", "1401310559", "B007197I4Y", "B0028SVY2A", "B00022PZ2Y", "B000EULSSE", "1439191107", "B003PU82CU", "B000C20VIW", "B0007G89GY", "B0000009QG", "B0000CDRW5", "B007NE07VI", "B001HB1K0A", "B000NO2416", "B000RF7Y0C", "B000056BOW", "B000E33VWW", "B001MFNB5I", "B000QFAFNQ"], "bought_together": ["B001D5C1FI", "B0002I848K"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0002I848K", "B001D5C1FI", "B00007G1WV", "B00007G1WZ"]}, "price": 12.83, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 61291}, "asin": "B000FFJZOW", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51SKTA29SSL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "George Carlin - Jammin' in New York"}

{"description": "Before the suave David Suchet, there was the imposing, twinkly Peter Ustinov as Agatha Christie's unflappable Belgian detective, Hercule Poirot. Ustinov's Poirot, who appeared in several TV films of Christie's works in the mid-'80s, is not as metrosexual as Suchet's. He plays Poirot as world-weary and ever-so-slightly rumpled--despite the jaunty upturned trademark mustache.Thirteen for Dinnerfeatures Poirot trying to solve the murder of one Lord Edgeware, investigating, among others, the lovely mystery woman played by a witchy Faye Dunaway. (And in a fun bit of foreshadowing, Suchet appears here in the role of Poirot's sidekick Japp.)Dead Man's Follyfinds Poirot and an old friend, a mystery writer played by Jean Stapleton, at a \"murder hunt\" party at which the dead body really does turn up dead.Murder in Three Actsfinds Poirot far afield in sunny Acapulco, at a glorious villa belonging to a suave actor played by Tony Curtis. A random death-by-martini at a posh party opens the door to the possibility of murder--handy that Poirot is there to help the local constables. The supporting cast features top '80s TV actors like Emma Samms as the actor's arm candy, and Diana Muldaur (the wicked Rosalind Shays onL.A. Law. The production values are also topnotch--with gorgeous location shots in Mexico adding both romance but also unnerving isolation to the proceedings. As Ustinov's Poirot says after the dreadful event, \"Logic tells me it's not murder--but instinct keeps tapping me on the shoulder.\"--A.T.

{"description": "Welcome to the dark side. At the end ofThe O.C.'s second season, Marissa (Mischa Barton) shoots the troubled Trey to stop him from strangling his brother, Ryan (Ben McKenzie). She saves her boyfriend's life, but it leads to her expulsion from Harbor High--just as she was to begin her senior year. Meanwhile, Ryan's guardian, Kirsten (Kelly Rowan), is doing time in rehab. It won't be easy for her to stay dry with two-faced resident Charlotte (Jeri Ryan,Shark) making every attempt to take advantage of her vulnerability. Ever the hothead, Ryan recovers in time to punch out the mean new dean (Eric Mabius,Ugly Betty), who expels him next. So, Kirsten's husband, Sandy (Peter Gallagher), hires a tutor, while Marissa attends public school where she falls in with the surfing crowd, including the besotted Johnny (Ryan Donowho). Arguably, Marissa's newly widowed mother, Julie (Melinda Clarke), is hit hardest when she finds that husband Caleb (Kirsten's father) didn't leave behind as much money as expected. Then the mansion is repossessed, and wild child Kaitlin (Willa Holland) returns from boarding school. And that's just the beginning of Julie's woes.By the finale, two of these people will be gone forever, but it wouldn't beThe O.C.if there weren't some bright spots along the way. College-bound couple Seth (Adam Brody) and Summer (Rachel Bilson) are still full of quips, the Tracy Flick-like Taylor (Autumn Reeser), who plays a bigger role in the next season, is a welcome addition, and the soundtrack is jam-packed with material from the likes of MIA, Gang of Four, Sufjan Stevens, Lady Sovereign, and the Subways, who appear in \"The Anger Management.\" Sadly, this would be the last full season ofThe O.C.as only 16 episodes were produced for the fourth and final year.--Kathleen C.

{"description": "Cunningly fusing father-son sentiment and more blows to the groin per minute than any other movie you'll see this (and possibly any other) year,Little Manaims to win the heart of any man who's ever wished his son was actually a foul-mouthed, jewel-thieving midget. The rubbery face of Marlon Wayans (White Chicks) is digitally transposed onto the body of an actual midget so that Marlon can play Calvin, a bad-tempered thief who's trying to retrieve a humongous diamond from the purse of Vanessa (Kerry Washington,Ray), the buppie wife of Darryl (Shawn Wayans,Scary Movie 2). Darryl doesn't care about his wife's new promotion, he just wants to have a child--and he gets one when Calvin arrives on his doorstep dressed in baby clothes. At which point, the kicks, head-butts, and blunt object trauma to the groin begin. It's beside the point to argue whether or not this is definitively funny; blows to the groin either make you laugh or they don't, and if they do, you know who you are and you should seek this movie out. It will give you all you could possibly ask for, including numerous jokes about bodily functions and breasts.

{"description": "Only one film under his belt, and already Flynn Carsen (Noah Wylie) is  talking like Indiana Jones. \"Relax,\" he tells a companion before daringly retrieving an ancient artifact before it can be used for evil. \"This kind of stuff happens to me all the time.\" A character of modest charms (much like this made-for-cable movie), Carsen is not your typical movie action hero. His brain serves him better than his brawn. Early on, his knowledge of vegetation plays a key role in a cliff-jumping escape from pursuing bad guys. Carsen, for those just tuning in, is a librarian at the Metropolitan Library, which secretly houses history's mythic artifacts, including the sword Excalibur, and the Shroud of Turin. The fate of the world is once again in Carsen's hands when a map to the legendary King Solomon's Mines is stolen. Carsen embarks on another fantastic global adventure, with stops in Casablanca (with inevitable references to the Humphrey Bogart classic) and Kenya. This time, he has new female companionship, Emily (Gabrielle Anwar), a beautiful archaeologist who can match the much-educated Carsen degree for degree. Reprising their roles from the first film are Olympia Dukakis as Flynn's meddling mother, who tries to fix him up with his third cousin (\"You'll have plenty to talk about\"), Jane Curtin as flinty library administrator, Charlene (\"Save your receipts\"), and Bob Newhart as his mentor, Judson. Savvy viewers will see plot twists and character revelations coming from a mile away, but that is all part of the fun, as are the hokey special effects and knowing humor (\"There's always a secret passage,\" Carsen observes while navigating a catacomb). Who know if there will ever be anotherIndiana Jonesmovie. Until then,The Librarianis worth checking out, especially on DVD, where it can be enjoyed without intrusive commercial interruption.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0009NSCRQ", "B001MVYUQG", "B001RXDM1I", "B0002J58GU", "B003KW7CQ0", "B003QJC208", "B003MX91H0", "B004I1K2FK", "B001L2ZSFS", "B0013BM63O", "B0000YEEPS", "B00K2CHW48", "B00GTZWZH6", "B00K2CHWYI", "B006QU70OM", "B00GSTHC7G", "B00GOHZLDO", "B00KHA9BQ2", "B00F3L8P26", "B00005JN5E", "B003XEKUBY", "B00B999F2U", "B00IYRLUAU", "B008JFURII", "B004LROMS4", "B008L0YMVE", "B00JPFTX5O", "B0007OCG5Q", "B00L4K450G", "B001GF8WP8", "B00K2CHX9C", "B0009PBLU4", "B0006IIPIK", "B00B9UEOPC", "B00J11U54K", "B00K7IPFSM", "B006VJ1AAI", "B004UXVDOA", "B000M53GMW", "B000FO0A9W", "B007R6DJP8", "B00003CY6P", "B0090SI56Y", "B00E8OMZGG", "B008JFUNTG", "B005LAIH2W", "B00FR23QNE", "B0010X741Y", "B000MX7V70", "B003L77FYS", "B00LG6XHDY", "B002BWP2IK", "6305428514", "B000NDEXPM", "B00GTZWXYQ", "B00HVFA322", "B007K3JFUQ", "B00HJAB094", "B0051GOB2G", "0785190295", "B00EIXWMII", "B00FE5MX74", "B00GOHZV6Q", "B002ZG99KO", "B00AEBB8QK", "B00005JM5B", "B0053O89KG", "B003L77GWE", "1401324819", "B00BD6KXKW", "B00GTZWUPS", "B00KS9V6EC", "B00F84H73Q", "B0016Q2D5M", "B000Y11BC6", "B00DW5IJR6", "B0006GAOCW", "B00DI013EG", "B002U0KHME", "B003R4ZMPE", "B005G4TJUC", "B00018D3YG", "1484711424", "B00E5I2M6I", "B003F3NDWG", "B00IWTVDUW", "B00KHB3H5W", "B00K0D9760", "B00005JO5L", "B005PPMHO2", "B0056GLNQI", "B00AIBZMM2", "0792839137", "B009AMAKWM", "B00023BLXK", "B000ASATYY", "B003RHZ6CK", "B0049GYXH2", "B000BW7QWW", "B00E5I2M9K"], "bought_together": ["B0009NSCRQ", "B001MVYUQG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0009NSCRQ", "B001MVYUQG", "B001RXDM1I", "B005GELLQC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 5847}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 10.19, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B000IJ7A24", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51MPVHjLa9L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Librarian  - Return to King Solomon's Mines"}

{"description": "If Richard Donner's 1978 feature filmSuperman: The Moviemade us believe a man could fly, Bryan Singer's 2006 follow-up,Superman Returns, lets us remember that a superhero movie can make our spirits soar. Superman (played by newcomer Brandon Routh) comes back to Earth after a futile five-year search for his destroyed home planet of Krypton. As alter ego Clark Kent, he's eager to return to his job at the Daily Planet and to see Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth). Lois, however, has moved on: she now has a fianc&#xE9; (James Marsden), a son (Tristan Leabu), and a Pulitzer Prize for her article entitled \"Why the World Doesn't Need Superman.\" On top of this emotional curveball, his old archrival Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) is plotting the biggest land grab in history.Singer, who made a strong impression among comic-book fans for his work on the X-Men franchise and directed Spacey inThe Usual Suspects, brings both a fresh eye and a sense of respect to the world's oldest superhero. He borrows John Williams's great theme music and Marlon Brando's voice as Jor-El, and the story (penned by Singer'sX-Mencollaborators Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris) is a sort-of-sequel to the first two films in the franchise (choosing to ignore that the third and fourth movies ever happened). The humorous and romantic elements give the movie a heart, Singer's art-deco Metropolis is often breathtaking, and the special effects are elegant and spectacular, particularly an early airplane-disaster set-piece. Of the cast, Routh is excellent as the dual Superman/Clark, Spacey is both droll and vicious as Luthor, and Parker Posey gets the best lines as Luthor's moll Kitty. But at 23, Bosworth seems too young for the five-years-past-grizzled Lois. It's nice to see Noel Neill, Jack Larson (both from the classicAdventures of SupermanTV series), and Eva Marie-Saint on the screen as well. Superman Returns is one of those projects that was in development for seemingly forever, but it was worth the wait -- it's the most enjoyable superhero movie sinceSpider-Man 2andThe Incredibles.--David HoriuchiMore SupermanWatch our exclusive interviews with the cast ofSuperman ReturnsOther feature filmsSuperman in high definitionSmallvilleAdventures of SupermanSee all Superman DVDs", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001DJLD2G", "B000IJ79VQ", "B000IJ79X4", "B000IJ79XE", "B000IJ79WU", "B008JFUPFI", "B000IJ79UW", "B001CDR1FG", "B000ION23U", "B002GSXKN8", "B004EPZ07K", "B0000959N0", "B00005JNTU", "B004LWZWFQ", "B001DHXT20", "B000VI70QS", "B0006L0LOS", "B0007P0Y7C", "B000UR9T8C", "B00005JNJV", "B00005JMQW", "B00005JKCH", "B000AYELVU", "B004LWZW42", "B0090SI56Y", "B001OST0LW", "B001OST0M6", "B001QB9H1U", "B000HCO83Q", "B000PE0G0A", "B001GCUO1Q", "B0002IQMAM", "B004LWZWGA", "B008JFUS0U", "B000P0J06K", "B000OVLBF8", "B00E5I2MCM", "B003YAR97K", "B001GZ6QC4", "B00080ZG2O", "B003QO8TOQ", "B001FB55HQ", "B005LAIGW8", "B000I8OM94", "B000FO0AHY", "B00IZZDWKM", "B000P0J06U", "B0007V6ITE", "B008JFUO72", "B000AYELVA", "B002NXSRVG", "B00DYEN6XC", "B00E5I2MEK", "B000BT96EG", "B001HQZJMU", "B001QTXM5Y", "B00E5I2M6I", "B002HWRYJE", "B00E5I2M9K", "B001614E68", "B000059Z8L", "B001VLBDD0", "B000EU1Q3Q", "B000EU1Q2M", "B000KJU1KK", "B00BTYMPUY", "B000H30B2C", "B001F7MSFM", "B0013BM63O", "B00F4FFO8E", "B000EGDB10", "B00008G8M5", "B00JPS7HOA", "0790738953", "B000B7QCGS", "B000HWZ4E8", "B00BBXSPES", "B000FMGTTE", "B0083SBMBM", "B003Z8ZCDO", "B005LAII44", "B000P6XQ50", "B000VI28Z6", "B00AZMFJYA", "B001RHGRT8", "B000F4RH8E", "B002ZG99B8", "B001AK3S4Y", "B00005JL78", "B0002ZMHX6", "B0007G89FU", "B006VRRGNK", "B00BBAQD6S", "B009JBWOU0", "B000BT96FA", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B00BGI086Q", "B003UN2ICM", "B0000VCZMK"], "bought_together": ["B008JFUPFI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B008JFUPFI", "B00F4FFO8E", "B001DJLD2G", "B000IJ79UW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 57565}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.73, "brand": "DC Comics", "asin": "B000J10EQU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Ddmxk8VML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Superman Returns (Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "A remake of the Italian filmL'Ultimo Bacio,The Last Kisswas largely ignored in theaters despite its Gen-X themes and appeal of star Zach Braff (Scrubs), who last made a splash in theaters with his similar twentysomething angst filmGarden State. A drama about midlife crises (mostly for people approaching 30, that is), director Tony Goldwyn (A Walk on the Moon) has assembled a top-notch cast, but there's not enough likeability in the characters to care. Architect Michael (Zach Braff) is a commitmentphobe who wanders into a flirtation with coed Kim (Rachel Bilson) because he's gun-shy about settling down with his perfect girlfriend Jenna (Jacinda Barrett), who's expecting his child. His fellow pals face their own romantic crossroads; one (Michael Weston) desires to settle down with a woman who doesn't love him back; another (Eric Christian Olsen) can't find someone who just wants a meaningless fling like him; and the third (Casey Affleck), ponders leaving his weary wife who's constantly berating his shortcomings as a father. Most depressing is Jenna's mother (Blythe Danner), who's tired of feeling neglected by her stoic husband (Tom Wilkinson). Danner and Wilkinson are compelling as longtime marrieds who've lost their spark, but Braff's character is wholly unlikeable, even aside from his indiscretions. The bright spot is Bilson, in her first movie role, utterly adorable as the sexy college student who's got more parts vulnerability and sass than any stuck in the Other Woman role. There's some fine acting inThe Last Kiss, but not enough character development to care about anything they're going through.The DVD includes a commentary featuring cast members Braff, Barrett, Olsen, Bilson, and director Goldwyn, who all mainly hoot during Olsen's sex scenes and ogle Bilson's seductive dancing. Braff and Goldwyn also imitate Bilson's high-pitched speedchatter throughout, while Barrett educates the cast on the similarities between \"the dingo ate my baby\" and the O.J. Simpson case (don't ask). It's all the more entertaining compared to a separate commentary track with just Goldwyn and Braff, who mostly drones about the music he picked for the film (Remy Zero, Snow Patrol, Aimee Mann) and raves about the minimalist score, done by singer Michael Penn. And oh, they ogle Bilson's dancing in this one too. --Ellen A.

{"description": "&#34;The Fall of Berlin:The Restored Soviet Epic&#34;, directed by Mikhail Chiaureli is now available on DVD. Long Notorious, Rarely seen: Soviet cinema's definitive Stalinist recreation of World War 2 also serves as the crowning moment in Stalin's postwar deification. Stalin himself worked on the screenplay for this blockbuster epic, fine-tuning its portrayal of the dictator as father-hero to his people. No expense was spared in production: 5 artillery and infantry divisions, 4 tank battalions, 193 planes, and 45 German trophy Panzers, as well as 1.5 million liters of fuel, were used in staging its panoramic battle scenes. The film's remarkable recreations of the battle for Berlin, climaxing in the bitter struggle over the Reichstag, impressed even the film's Western critics with their gritty realism and sheer spectacle. Equally memorable is the film's depiction of Hitler and his inner circle, whose folly and intrigues play out on sets that recreate the grandiosity of the Fueher's Chancellory and the claustrophobia of his bunker with surrealistic intensity.Reflecting the emerging antagonisms of the Cold War, the film also serves up a caustic polemic against Stalin's British and American wartime allies, depicting FDR and (especially) Churchill as closeted Nazi sympathizers, capable of any treachery against the Soviet state. Wildly ambitious in its geopolitical sweep,The Fall of Berlinalso manages to throw in a romantic subplot involving a leaden Stakhanovite, while settling any number of domestic political scores - General Georgy Zhukov, for example, appears as a gullible fool, saved from his errors only by Stalin's timely intervention.Indeed, Stalin's timely interventions provide this film its organizing principle, and it is he who pulls together all the threads of its wildly spinning narrative. Whether directing the Red Army to brilliant victory or anticipating Churchill's treachery or providing sage advice to lovelorn Stakhanovites, he remains unflappable, avuncular, uncannily prescient and wise. Stalin is always with us, one character proclaims to his comrades on the battlefront; the propagandistic function of this film is to make us feel this god-like presence in every scene. Presented to Stalin as a gift on his seventieth birthday, viewed by some 38 million Soviet filmgoers upon its initial release, winner of every conceivable Soviet prize,The Fall of Berlinwas abruptly pulled from circulation during the &#34;de-Stalinization&#34; campaigns that began after Stalin's death in 1953. Having recently gained rights to the original negative, International Historic Films offers this long-suppressed epic in a digitally-restored version, with historical commentaries and supplements.Note: Vividly filmed in Agfacolor film stock removed from Germany by the Red Army,The Fall of Berlinfeatures a film score by Dmitri Shostakovich.DVD FEATURES:Photo Gallery with Accompanying Scholarly Audio CommentarySwitchable English SubtitlesDigitally Restored and Re-MasteredRegion 0: Compatible with All DVD Players Worldwide.USSR, 1949, Color, (Part 1: 74 minutes, Part 2: 77 minutes) Total Running Time: 151 minutes, Russian Dialogue with English subtitles.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004TXFFI6", "B005D5OWJM", "B00BTJI2U6", "B0058IBBCU", "B002QP145C", "B00CXZQZF4", "B009KCS97A", "B00D3XMA9A", "B004GNBBVO", "9713727150", "B00ID8HATK", "B00C2535TE", "B000NPQ0GA", "B00ID8H8EW", "B009XTF8NI", "B004NJC0I4", "B0009UKV5U", "B000F48DCS", "B00D3XM7H0", "0700619550", "B005DKS1TE", "B003XQRZ56", "B0000BWVCR", "B00BC1UPRO", "B000JLIYRQ", "B00CHYSSME", "B00GMP6IBM", "1909982164", "B00CVB6UXW", "0700619569", "B00JISUJXS", "B002LFPBJW", "B00BYS0SV8", "B00IJZW4HK", "B000YKT4BW", "B00IKPXX92", "4327158917", "B00CBDG4UY", "B004H9ZQ4K", "B000K2UEDG", "B000066C6H", "1782005994", "0992274907", "0700616640", "B00JAD6GS8", "B001GR2ZA4", "B004IFYMXO", "B000E1E2N6", "B007R7V3MS", "B0041H55H6", "B0000646UM", "0615354963", "B00BZHPM0K", "0700616306", "B002KECJZ8", "1606998005", "1107035120", "1909982091", "B00A5P0UKU", "B000LM9QR0", "1781590087", "B005OTGS08", "B00IY1T8T6", "1909982199", "0764343769", "B00IGK6TOM", "B000WC38N2", "1908916516", "1782006257", "B00DOZNIVG", "076434479X", "B005HQBO9I", "B00HRJVHOU", "B000742FZW", "B000P7V4MG", "B00A92MFQG", "2352501008", "B00IS6WPT2", "B004UBPW6M", "0700619011", "B00D9BNONW"], "bought_together": ["B004TXFFI6", "B005D5OWJM"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00HGJB3MC", "B00ID8H8EW", "B004TXFFI6", "B00BTJI2U6"]}, "price": 24.95, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 59909}, "asin": "B000JM77PU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51AejkOgosL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Fall of Berlin: The Restored Soviet Two-Part WW 2 Epic (DVD)"}
{"description": "First screened in Europe and scheduled for limited release in the U.S.,The Illusionistoffers welcome proof that \"arthouse\" quality needn't be limited to the arthouses. Set in turn-of-the-century Vienna, this stately, elegant period film benefited from a crossover release in mainstream cinemas, and showed considerable box-office staying power--granted, teenage mallrats and lusty males may have been drawn to the allure ofSeventh Heavenalumna Jessica Biel, who rises to the occasion with a fine performance. But there's equal appeal in the casting of Edward Norton and Paul Giamatti, who bring their formidable talents to bear on the intriguing tale of a celebrated magician named Eisenheim (Norton) whose stage performance offends the Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell), a vindictive lout who aims to marry Duchess Sophie (Biel), Eisenheim's childhood friend and now, 15 years later, his would-be lover. This romantic rivalry and Eisenheim's increasingly enigmatic craft of illusion are investigated by Chief Inspector Uhl (Giamatti), who's under Leopold's command and is therefore not to be trusted as Eisenheim and Sophie draw closer to their inevitable reunion. Cleverly adapted by director Neil Burger from Steven Millhauser's short story \"Eisenheim the Illusionist,\" and boasting exquisite production values and a fine score by Philip Glass,The Illusionistis the kind of class act that fully deserved its unusually wide and appreciative audience. --Jeff ShannonBeyondThe Illusionist\"Eisenheim the Illusionist\" and Other StoriesPaul Giamatti in a More Loveable RoleMagic Kits & AccessoriesStills fromThe Illusionist", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000LC55F2", "B000NOIX48", "B002ZG980U", "B002WNU0QW", "B00DWZHTOU", "B001MZ5W3M", "B00011CZRE", "B000H0MKI8", "B00008K7AO", "B000L212HC", "B00AEBB8NI", "B000GFLKF8", "B000O76ZO4", "B00003CXZ4", "B00005JLSB", "B000FKO5QK", "B000M341QE", "B00AEFXGIY", "B00005V9HH", "B00AEBB8LA", "B00005JMOW", "B00096S49Y", "0767847415", "6305313687", "B004SIP9Z6", "B0047T74CM", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B000R4SMCW", "B0002YLCG0", "B000P0J0EW", "B000HEWEE4", "B0041KKYHE", "B00BBI7EZY", "B00AEBBA2W", "B000CQLZ0Q", "0783235070", "0767802519", "B002ZG997C", "B00003CXHG", "B004SIP7ZS", "B000069HZP", "B004SIP7PS", "B003ASLJQI", "B00177Y9ZC", "B00005JLKN", "B003ZW9H68", "B001N44BVQ", "B002O3Z50Q", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00005JN2Z", "B00AEBB86A", "B00000F4ZY", "B000MZHW40", "0671686402", "B00BB67UNW", "B005HP2J0M", "B000QXDED6", "B000NIVJF4", "B001F12J0C", "B000N6TX1I", "B000LAZE8C", "B00080ZG10", "B005LAIGRS", "B0009MDPYM", "0792159659", "B000OYC7BW", "B001UV4XGU", "B004AOECXI", "0767818105", "B000XR9L50", "B0018O4YT0", "B00015YVDG", "B004SIP8JI", "B00004XPPG", "B00006ZXSK", "B001DHXT20", "B0000AC8LR", "B009B8YMB0", "0783229402", "B0006210ZG", "B001PPGAIA", "B00004BZIY", "B008JFURII", "B00005JPAR", "B00006ADFM", "B004SIP7TE", "B000F5GNX8", "B000FS9FCG", "B006P0FIGU", "B00005JMCN", "B002VWNID6", "B004XQO90O", "B004EPZ084", "B00AEBB9M8", "B000P5FH3K", "B00005JNY3", "B000063US3", "B003L20IG0"], "bought_together": ["B000LC55F2", "B002ZG980U"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000LC55F2", "B005LAIHXQ", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00DV2MVWO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 60145}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.0, "brand": "Twentieth Century Fox", "asin": "B000K7VHPU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51nYghoS63L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Illusionist (Full Screen Edition)"}
{"description": "First screened in Europe and scheduled for limited release in the U.S.,Bandidascan now be viewed by all fans of the visually stunning duo, Penelope Cruz and Salma Hayek. Set in Mexico 1888,Bandidasis a Western spoof about two women, Maria Alvarez (Penelope Cruz) and Sara Sandoval (Salma Hayek), who seek to avenge the tragedies befallen both their fathers under robber baron, Tyler Jackson (Dwight Yoakam). Jackson, employed by the Bank of New York, is sent to Mexico to buy land and open banks to the detriment of local culture. Jackson kills Sara's corrupt father, Don Diego, while bandits burn down Maria's home. The two ladies band together for the community's cause. Under the tutelage of Bill Buck (Sam Sheperd), Sara and Maria develop bank robbery skills. When criminologist, Quentin Cooke (Steve Zahn), hunts them, they convert him with their strong moral sense and good looks. Like anyThelma and Louise-ish tale of women who take charge, Maria and Sara are foil characters who eventually become an invincible, sisterly team. This comedy is built around their bickering. For Sara, with European education and penchant of designer clothing, Maria is a hick who lacks refinement, yet Maria, horse whisperer, can fire a gun. The slapstick is overkill, for example when Sara wonders whether a bandana is Gucci or Prada. However, viewers will love Penelope Cruz on horseback and the two actresses practice-kissing their foe in a brothel.Bandidasis a light film with some laughs and mucho sex appeal.  --Trinie DaltonBeyondBandidasMore Films from Salma HayekMore Films from Penelope CruzMore Comic WesternsStills fromBandidas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B005Z9MFWC", "B008LC8V1Y", "B000FIHN5M", "B0000A2ZU1", "B0000WN140", "B0007KZQAM", "B001OXLGJQ", "B00005LMAL", "B00005N91C", "B0000ZG0NQ", "B00005LZOD", "076780421X", "0767817710", "B000067J24", "B004SIP7S0", "B004P7CN5O", "B000085OXZ", "B0006J27WO", "B007P1PQUG", "B004QI14KW", "B00E8AVNAE", "B00AEFZ2DG", "B0000A2ZTY", "B000ASDFI6", "B000KX0HIW", "B0045HCIYA", "B00J49R1BY", "B0000X2EIS", "B005LAII94", "B002ZG98C8", "B00F3TDA6O", "B000F8O2QU", "B0019K4YT8", "B000BITVBA", "B0048LVDHG", "B00HEPC0TS", "B00005YUNT", "B003VADSJG", "B000U1ZV80", "B0001FVECM", "B000059H7K", "B00HRUQ8HK", "B000CEXGAU", "B002ZG98KK", "B002ZG984Q", "B00HW3LAF2", "B00BLN4V5A", "B002C4N66M", "B004LS6CNG", "B0050MB57U", "B00B6OEB18", "B00008CMSX", "B0010DM3R4", "B006OALDLA", "B00IKM5L6I", "B0048LVDGM", "B00EON8RHM", "B00IOFDJWY", "B000GIW9I2", "B00003L9BB", "B003NF97MQ", "B007C4ZJ0S", "B00016MSV2", "B0001CNRRU", "B001U0HB5Q", "B000KLQUSU", "B00APUAKYG", "B001AZW73M", "B0002S64TQ", "B000FAOCC2", "0783229402", "B00024JC30", "B00HOGBXS6", "B003Y5H5C4", "B000ARXF96", "B00DS79HD8", "B002U4UYZK", "B0007UDC80", "6305213283", "B000E8JO3C", "B000053VBV", "B003AWRMCE", "B00005JMWP", "B003YOZNBU", "B00JBGSHSQ", "B00E8G5H8W", "6305504024", "6304884400", "B000FUTVLY", "B006LOBZSA", "B002S5N052", "B00003CXXY", "B001MTYRKC", "B000Y7U94G", "B005LAII44", "B0002J4X2K", "B004A8ZWSS", "B00006ZXSI", "B0045HCIYU", "B00GSTHC7G"], "bought_together": ["B005Z9MFWC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005Z9MFWC", "B004SIP7S0", "B008LC8V1Y", "B000FIHN5M"]}, "price": 9.38, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 66506}, "asin": "B000K7VHNW", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Z7581WDEL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Bandidas"}

{"description": "Much was written about Will Ferrell's first \"dramatic role\" as Harold Crick, an IRS auditor who begins hearing a voice narrating his life. ButStranger Than Fictionis hardly a drama. However, what Ferrell does--like Jim Carrey before him inThe Truman Show--is handle a toned-down character with genuineness and affection: you believe he is this guy. Crick leads a lonely life filled with numbers and routines. While at first he considers the voice a nuisance, Crick decides more action is needed when it speaks of \"his demise.\" Enter Professor Jules Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman), who takes on the absurd notion with revelry, trying to find out what kind of book Crick's life is leading. It turns out that the voice Crick is hearing belongs to Kay Eiffel (Emma Thompson), a very real--and troubled--author who is writing a book in which Crick is a fictional character. As usual with these things, the stuffed shirt learns to live a better life--Crick even falls for one of his audits, a brash baker named Ana (Maggie Gyllenhaal). Marc Foster (Monster's Ball, Finding Neverland) has the right tone for the film, using great urban scenes (the unnamed city is Chicago) with interesting visualizations of Crick's world of numbers. He also directs Ferrell, Hoffman, and Gyllenhaal to their most charming performances (plus Linda Hunt and Tom Hulce pop up in two funny scenes). Ferrell succeeds in being a romantic lead you can root for; a scene where he eats Ana's freshly baked cookies is totally delightful without a hint of sarcasm. Screenwriter Zach Helm has two personal traits with his story: like Crick he followed his heart (he stopped rewriting scripts and only worked on his own) and like Eiffel, the final results are not a masterpiece, but good, and entertaining enough.

{"description": "Martin Scorsese makes a welcome return to the mean streets (of Boston, in this case) withThe Departed, hailed by many as Scorsese's best film sinceCasino. Since this crackling crime thriller is essentially a Scorsese-stamped remake of the acclaimed 2002 Hong Kong thrillerInfernal Affairs, the film was intensely scrutinized by devoted critics and cinephiles, and while Scorsese's intense filmmaking and all-star cast deserve ample acclaim,The Departedis also worthy of serious re-assessment, especially with regard to what some attentive viewers described as sloppy craftsmanship (!), notably in terms of mismatched shots and jagged continuity. But no matter where you fall on the Scorsese appreciation scale, there's no denying thatThe Departedis a signature piece of work from one of America's finest directors, designed for maximum impact with a breathtaking series of twists, turns, and violent surprises. It's an intricate cat-and-mouse game, but this time the cat and mouse are both moles: Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) is an ambitious cop on the rise, planted in the Boston police force by criminal kingpin Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a hot-tempered police cadet who's been artificially disgraced and then planted into Costello's crime operation as a seemingly trustworthy soldier. As the multilayered plot unfolds (courtesy of a scorching adaptation byKingdom of Heavenscreenwriter William Monahan), Costigan and Sullivan conduct a volatile search for each other (they're essentially looking for \"themselves\") while simultaneously wooing the psychiatrist (Vera Farmiga) assigned to treat their crime-driven anxieties.Such convenient coincidences might sink a lesser film, butThe Departedis so electrifying that you barely notice the plot-holes. And while Nicholson's profane swagger is too much \"Jack\" and not enough \"Costello,\" he's still a joy to watch, especially in a film that's additionally energized by memorable (and frequently hilarious) supporting roles for Alec Baldwin, Mark Wahlberg, and a host of other big-name performers.The Departedalso makes clever and plot-dependent use of cell-phones, to the extent that it couldn't exist without them. Powered by Scorsese's trademark use of well-chosen soundtrack songs (from vintage rock to Puccini's operas),The Departedmay not be perfect, but it's one helluva ride for moviegoers, proving popular enough to become the biggest box-office hit of Scorsese's commercially rocky career.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002ZG99N6", "B000P0J09M", "B004SIP7TE", "B004SIP8ZM", "B002ZG980U", "B002VWNIEA", "B00011CZRE", "B00AEBB8NI", "B002T9H2LA", "B00005JLSB", "B000MZHW40", "B00080ZG10", "B003ASLJQS", "B000P0J0AG", "B000P0J0EW", "B000C20VPA", "B003UESJHO", "B004SIP7ZS", "B003ASLJO0", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B002CPMB9O", "B00AHTYI5M", "B00275EGWY", "B000XR9L50", "B000A3XY5A", "B0007DFJ0G", "B001N44BVQ", "B00003CXWV", "B008MILL8W", "B000286RP2", "B004SIP7VM", "B00005V9HH", "6305313687", "B00AEBB9NM", "B004FQX5B6", "B00AEFXKUI", "B004SIP95G", "B00AEBB86A", "B005LAIIJY", "B0016Q2D66", "B003ASLJQI", "B00008975Z", "B000IY04Q8", "B001P9KR8U", "B00005JNJV", "B000C20VRS", "B008R65XYC", "B005LAIGRS", "B00H9KKGTO", "B00008DP4C", "B00AEBB9F0", "B00AEFY5B6", "B00005JN0W", "B005LAIGLE", "B000A2UBN4", "B002QEHPQU", "B000P0J0EM", "B003UESJH4", "B007D5E7C2", "6304765258", "B000P0J0D8", "B00AEFY0XE", "B00004WG2F", "0767830555", "B000LC55F2", "B002O3Z4Y8", "B004EPYZP8", "B000A7DVR2", "B00005JPD0", "B000WZEZGI", "B00049QQHI", "B000FS9FCG", "B00004XPPB", "B006OFN0SE", "B009AMAL4Y", "B004U7MR14", "B000GFLKF8", "B003AWRMCE", "B0019L770A", "B00BEIYN9Q", "B0000AM6JI", "B004SIP9Z6", "B001GZ6QC4", "0783240295", "B0010DR4BO", "B000065U1N", "B00001ZWUS", "B00BB67UNW", "B0000B1OFL", "B00AEBB9K0", "B00DHDDE32", "B00005JKWX", "B0051MKNV8", "B002ZG97RE", "0767802519", "B0034G4P94", "B00DHHWXYY", "B00005B6JZ", "B00003CXZ4", "B001TODCII"], "bought_together": ["B000P0J09M"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000RETOHY", "B000P0J09M", "B000P0J0EW", "B00AEBB8NI"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 5067}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.5, "brand": "Warner Bros", "asin": "B000M341QE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RZnzpL34L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)"}
