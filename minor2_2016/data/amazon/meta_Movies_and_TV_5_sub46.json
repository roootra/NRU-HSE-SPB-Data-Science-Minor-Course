{"description": "Riverdance, the Irish hard-shoe sensation that took PBS viewers by storm,  underwent its second  incarnation withLive from New York City, a 1996 performance filmed at  Radio City Music Hall. While most of the attributes from 1995'sRiverdance: The Showremain--the dazzling ensemble choreography, Bill Whelan's energetic score, and the New Age-y view of Celtic mythology--the most significant difference is at the top, where Colin Dunne replaced bombastic lead dancer Michael Flatley.  Though lacking Flatley's bravura, Dunne is a superb technician who works well with Flatley's former co-lead, Jean Butler.  Flamenco dancer Maria Pagis returns, as do the Riverdance Singers (formerly known as Anuna) with soloist Katie McMahon and the orchestra with fiery fiddler Eileen Ivers.About a half-hour longer than the 1995 original,Live from New York Cityexpands upon the second act's theme of the Irish leaving their homeland for  other parts of the world. \"Lift the Wings\" becomes a set piece for the people who are saying goodbye (it's hard not to miss the original's solo voice of Aine Um Cheallaigh), and a new song, \"Heal Their Hearts,\" is a showcase anthem for bass Morgan Crowley.  In the most engaging new number, \"Trading Taps,\" a  trio of Irish dancers faces off against two urban American tappers. While much  of this follow-up show will be familiar to those who know the original, it's different enough to be enjoyed on its own  terms. It's also more stylishly shot, but that's also its biggest  drawback--frenetic editing that allows only brief glimpses of the dancers and  leaves the viewer dizzy.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00000K32N", "B000929UNM", "B000ZOT8NG", "B004SKQAJI", "6304022492", "B004ZEDJ7S", "B00005NGAK", "B0001FVDQO", "B000005B2O", "B0000B1OD8", "B0002VGTYI", "B000929UNC", "B00HGGUS4O", "B00HDU2VIY", "B000001EPB", "B00IFKZB7E", "B000BUE5DM", "B00005NGAJ", "B004SKLFJS", "B00EV1D4IY", "B0007M22TI", "B008H6GH7Y", "B001KKSDKS", "B0024RIMBG", "B000KRNCYY", "B00EZRY62C", "B00004XMTJ", "B005RYF5JA", "B000BL99XM", "B002UZXJA6", "B004GJYR50", "B00004R99B", "B00AIBZJLG", "B004G8LKBU", "B0046A9RMC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000ZOT8NG", "B000929UNM", "B00000K32N", "B004SKQAJI"]}, "price": 25.45, "categories": [["CDs & Vinyl", "New Age", "Celtic New Age"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Pop", "Adult Alternative"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Pop", "Adult Contemporary"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Pop", "Dance Pop"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "World Music", "Europe", "British Isles", "Britain"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "World Music", "Europe", "British Isles", "Ireland"], ["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 61986}, "asin": "0767804341", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516QNYSMDPL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Riverdance - Live From New York City"}

{"description": "The schoolgirl adventures of Madeline, a flame-haired orphan, are lovingly adapted from Ludwig Bemelmans's classic children's books. His sly and witty writing is transferred to this first-rate film, one that should not be thought of merely as childhood entertainment. Spunky Madeline is most adept at finding trouble. She is also a quick-witted and likable child who can solve almost any problem. Her latest scheme is to keep her school, which is also her home, from being sold by its owner, the recently widowed Lord Covington (Nigel Hawthorne). Unlike most youthful movie fare, this adventure boasts high production values that wisely include colorful Parisian locations. Hatty Jones is all spunky self-sufficiency and sweet innocence in the title role, and Frances McDormand is quite humorous as the stern school-mistress, Miss Clavel.--Rochelle O'Gorman", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303314015", "6305045976", "6303052703", "B00005LL26", "B00000JYLP", "B00000J2JA", "B00001YX9H", "B00004RFHF", "0307143635", "0800141326", "6303568092", "B00003CXJ3", "0780619765", "B00007ELMS", "6304434340", "B000003KSM", "B00000IQBQ", "6304284519", "6304089627"], "also_viewed": ["B00004RFHF", "0800196767", "6304290888", "B00005JLGL", "6302178924", "6302526574", "B000035Z2S", "0792151712", "B00006AULB", "B00000JYLP", "1560395737", "6303939015", "6304500831", "0788805533", "078881172X", "6301390725", "0788805843", "6302642248", "6300275310", "6305319138", "6302426200", "6305229449", "6304030959", "0800142039", "B00000JGOQ", "6302965489"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 277247}, "categories": [["CDs & Vinyl", "Children's Music"], ["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.39, "brand": "", "asin": "0767816641", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Z9TYP1QQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Madeline [VHS]"}

{"description": "This often grisly, arguably racist movie stars Kevin Costner as a U.S. Navy pilot who is the improbable friend of a powerful, vaguely criminal Mexican millionaire (Anthony Quinn). While visiting the latter on his estate, Costner's character has an affair with his host's gorgeous young wife (Madeline Stowe), for which he is almost beaten to death and the wife mutilated and turned into a junkie prostitute (nice, eh?). The hero seeks retaliation, and you may want the same against director Tony Scott, who makes the navy sequences look like beefcake excerpts from his earlier hit film,Top Gun.

For all its catty talk and surface glamour, it's a flat, broadly directed satire that never lives up to its evocative title.

{"description": "Though only a short subject, this groundbreaking documentary remains one  of the most influential and powerful explorations of the Holocaust ever made.  Director Alain Resnais bluntly presents an indictment not only of the Nazis but of the world community, and the film is all the more remarkable for its harsh judgment considering the time in which it was made, less than a decade after the end of the war, when questions of responsibility were not yet being addressed. Juxtaposing archival clips from the concentration camps across Germany and Poland with the present-day denials of the camps' existence, the film seeks to once and for all expose the horrifying truth of the Final Solution, as well as to address the continuing anti-Semitism and bigotry that existed long after the war's end.  An invaluable resource and testament to history, this film was a profound influence on all films to address issues of the Holocaust, fromJudgment at NurembergandShoahtoSchindler's List.Night and Fogremains an essential and indispensable document of the 20th century.--Robert Lane", "related": {"also_viewed": ["6303997317"]}, "price": 10.86, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 472768}, "asin": "0780020227", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51TJEX8NRZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Night and Fog [VHS]"}

{"description": "Upon its release in 1948,Drunken Angelwas hailed in Japan as  Akira Kurosawa's directorial breakthrough, comparable to Kubrick'sPaths of Gloryin the way it catapulted Kurosawa into a higher level of artistic achievement. Kurosawa himself noted, \"In this picture I was finally myself. It wasmypicture. I was doing it and nobody else.\"It is indeed an important, vital film, confidently conceived and expertly executed, illuminating themes that would dominate the finest films in Kurosawa's exceptional career. The setting is a rancid, jerry-built section of a postwar city, where a filthy, disease-ridden pond functions as a physical threat and also as the film's central symbol of decay. It's in this hardscrabble environment that a brash young gangster (Toshiro Mifune, in the role that made him a star) visits an alcoholic doctor (Takashi Shimura) to have a bullet removed from his hand. The doctor discovers that the hot-tempered thug is also doomed by tuberculosis, seen here as the physical manifestation of the gangster's moral decay. The doctor is himself diseased by his drinking, and as these clashing men struggle to make some kind of difference in their pathetic lives (spurned by the return from prison of a ruthless yakuza boss), Kurosawa makes unlikely heroes of them both--men who undergo a personal transformation in a vile and violent world.Drunken Angelis a transitional film for Japanese cinema and especially for Kurosawa; it offers a vivid glimpse of postwar life (both rotten and restoring), and signals the full blossoming of Kurosawa's talent. And while the title role belongs to Shimura (so memorably poignant in Kurosawa's later masterpiece,Ikiru), the film belongs to the forceful presence of Mifune, whose vitality touches nearly every scene of this timeless and powerful drama.--Jeff Shannon", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 438258}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 15.0, "brand": "", "asin": "0780023447", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41EYZ5MNGQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Drunken Angel [VHS]"}

{"description": "Woody Allen roared back at his detractors withDeconstructing Harry, a bitterly funny treatise about the creative process. Known to mine his often tumultuous personal life for his movies, the embattled writer-director-star didn't bother to make his alter ego likable in this movie: Harry Block (Allen) pops pills, frequents prostitutes, and cheats on the women in his life, then writes about their foibles in thinly disguised fiction. No wonder they're all furious with him. As Harry journeys to his alma mater with a hooker, ill pal, and kidnapped son, a series of flashbacks unravel, juxtaposing Harry's relationships with their \"slightly exaggerated\" fictional counterparts. There are amusing cameos throughout, including a humorous turn by Demi Moore as a fictitious ex-wife who \"became Jewish with a vengeance,\" and Billy Crystal as the devil who found Hollywood too nasty for his liking. The humor is dark and caustic, but well worth it;Deconstructing Harryis a near-brilliant mediation on the sometimes queasy relationship between art, creator, and critic.--Diane Garrett", "related": {"also_bought": ["0767819764", "B000062XE6", "6304039166", "630450392X", "B00000JGOI", "6305291470", "6301972147", "B00005AUJK", "630146494X", "B00005O06J", "6305327068", "1439193886", "B002LMV7RA", "B003TRMLQM", "B00005O06K", "6305428085", "B005MYEQ4U", "B00004WI55", "B0009ALSFW", "6303011411"], "bought_together": ["6304039166"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 288551}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 10.0, "brand": "", "asin": "0780621654", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5165BZZNQ0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Deconstructing Harry [VHS]"}

{"description": "You're better off having been born after, say, 1965, if you really want to enjoy this corny romantic comedy and its abundant references to the MTV culture of the mid-1980s--and even then the odds are only 50-50 that you'll have a shamelessly good time. But a lot of people beat those odds, becauseThe Wedding Singerwas a surprise box-office hit when released in early 1998, and it resulted inSaturday Night Livegraduate Adam Sandler's salary going ridiculously sky-high. It's a schizophrenic film about a seemingly schizophrenic wedding singer (Sandler) who's charmingly sweet to some people but a tongue-lashing maniac to others, probably out of frustration over his fading ambition as a wannabe rock star (not to mention Sandler's penchant for loud-mouthed lunacy). When he meets an admiring young waitress (delightfully played by Drew Barrymore), it's love at first sight, complicated by their pending marriages tomuchless appealing fianc&eacute;s. The plot then contorts itself to accommodate this contrived will-they-or-won't-they? scenario, so you're better off ignoring the love story and focusing on the comedy, which is sporadic but occasionally hilarious. This is also a lighter, friendlier Sandler than moviegoers had seen before, which probably accounts for the movie's success. Toss in a fine supporting cast--including a show-stopping drunk act by indie-movie stalwart Steve Buscemi--and you've got the ingredients for a no-brainer that's ultimately more fun than it is annoying.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B008R65XTC", "630529142X", "B0001Z3TXE", "B00000K3UU", "B00006ZXSL", "B00003CXPS", "B00006FMUW", "B000BKVQS4", "B00005JL93", "B00003CXSM", "B003Y5H524", "B000VXWX7E", "B00005JG6N", "B00AEBB8NS", "B00005JM4Q", "B002ZG97TW", "B00466HN7M", "B008R65XUQ", "B000A0GP0Y", "B00006ZXSK", "B0009X761E", "B000HT386M", "B001DPHDB0", "B00AEBBA2C", "B0009OL7Z4", "0783227345", "B0090SI53C", "B0000524E5", "B006LL3WP2", "B00AEFXZJE", "B001FB55MG", "B0009X760U", "B001TUZD8O", "B002PLPQLU", "6304765266", "B000AMJG4E", "B000A343RI", "B00005JPE3", "B00015YVD6", "0783235070", "B0015I2RT8", "B00AEFXIUK", "6305428425", "B00386EZKE", "B000065V3H", "B00AG473GE", "B00AEFXO8Q", "B0000C8ROV", "B000EMGJAO", "B002K0WBXW", "B0007RT9M6", "B005Z9MFRC", "B00447L4KA", "B000PHX5P0", "B000957O82", "B008RNYMG0", "B000CEV3KU", "6305428050", "0767810856", "B00AEBB9DM", "6305428549", "B001AEF6BS", "B00081912E", "B002ZG989G", "B0000DIXDR", "B001AGXEAG", "B000QQLVPQ", "B0009HBPN0", "B004H83IJQ", "B00AEFY99O", "B000P0J0EM", "B00AEFY5TI", "B00AEBB8YW", "B004HO6I2E", "B000BKJ762", "B000YDBPAM", "B00026ZG10", "B00005JL7Q", "B00003CXMP", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00029RTCG", "B00AEFXXMI", "B00AEBB8R4", "B00319ECB0", "B0013D8LHC", "B000MQC9H4", "B00005NGAY", "B002ZG988M", "B003PIUIHO", "B000E6EHE0", "B000002NJJ", "B00AEFY0KW", "0800177258", "B00007E2F5", "B002JOUNE8", "B002GHHHME", "B00003CXE4", "B008R65XNS", "B00005JKWX", "B000BUE5E6"], "bought_together": ["630529142X", "B008R65XTC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000BKVQS4", "B00466HN7M", "B00006FMUW", "B0001Z3TXE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 95282}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.99, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "0780622588", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41DZFHhVIJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Wedding Singer"}

{"description": "Dorothy Dandridge was a Hollywood trailblazer. A confident sex symbol in the 1950s, she was the first black woman ever nominated for a Best Actress Oscar, but the electrifying stage chanteuse and dancer was forbidden to even enter the nightclubs and show rooms she performed in except from the stage. As portrayed by Halle Berry, who shepherded Dandridge's story to the screen, Dandridge is a sure, insistent star who battled racist studios and Jim Crow laws to maintain her dignity in public while stumbling through a private life marked by bad relationships and abusive lovers. Berry gives her best performance to date, brimming with ambition and moxie offstage, charming audiences with the slinky, sure moves of a nightclub veteran onstage, and convincingly \"becoming\" Dandridge in dramatic re-creations fromCarmen JonesandPorgy and Bess. Brent Spiner (Star Trek: The Next Generation) is sweet and sympathetic as her supportive, lovesick manager, and Klaus Maria Brandauer is, in Dandridge's words, a \"big old bulldog\" as director Otto Preminger. Director Martha Coolidge balances private troubles with professional milestones and setbacks and pulls no punches showing the institutional racism of late 1950s Las Vegas or the brutality of a vicious alcoholic husband. Originally made for HBO, this drama lacks the big-budget spectacle of traditional Hollywood biographies but offers in its place sharp writing, intelligent direction, and strong, sensitive performances.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005AQML", "B00AEFYG3S", "B000667HHW", "B0009S4IGA", "B00007L4KF", "B000Y11B8K", "B000B5XOSY", "B00465I192", "B004FK5EDY", "6305428409", "B000AJJNMM", "B0068FZ0W4", "B00465I1CE", "B000JLTRH2", "0790739313", "B00007AJG2", "B0006IIOHC", "B000BOH8X2", "B001P3SA94", "B000XA5JWG", "B0000560W6", "B00005RDAN", "B00066FAQW", "B000BOH922", "B003BV8I3Q", "B00441GZ1Y", "B000P0J092", "B000RO9Q7W", "B00005YU1M", "B00066FAVW", "B00EJU9GQ6", "B00DW5IL2E", "B00L6AW67I", "B00006LPHJ", "B000JJSL1W", "B000BNTMAA", "B00AEFY6TW", "B0000TWMTS", "B00066FAC6", "6306496238", "B00BTYPWDQ", "B00BYS0RQE", "B000P0J0CE", "B00066FAOE", "B003Y5H4ZC", "B0041QSZS8", "B0000714BT", "B00007AJG1", "B0007LPS7W", "B00AEFXTKO", "B0000WN0NW", "B00005JND5", "B000BOH91S", "6305505780", "B000051YMS", "B0016LFG4M", "B00G4Q3KOC", "B002CWKU36", "B00GOZ2LPM", "B003VEL8ZS", "0792838076", "B0079ZWUCA", "B000GW8RYI", "B000069I0E", "6305428336", "B000035P5I", "B00114XTHA", "B000R17RQM", "B00000JGHV", "B001K98MGE", "B004YCKJGU", "B000WMA73G", "B004MCGNS0", "B000TLOMPE", "B00000J2KE", "B0058KGHX6", "B000BITV9W", "1558908390", "B0000399WJ", "B000C03O8S", "B005CGI4O6", "B002CA68NO", "B00803PG44", "B00H47IX5G", "0060956755", "B00319ECI8", "B00CDWQNZ4", "B00AEFYNG8", "B0088RMEII", "B00067BCBI", "B004LLIRR2", "B00005U156", "B00004Y2R1", "B000784XBW", "0783230524", "B003JLL2QS", "B000BBOUHM", "B00125WAWS", "B00005ASOO", "B00GO4RGWQ"], "bought_together": ["B00005AQML", "B00AEFYG3S"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AEFYG3S", "B0009S4IGA", "B000Y11B8K", "B00007L4KF"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 152293}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 10.18, "brand": "HBO HOME VIDEO", "asin": "0783116748", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51thCNFe5gL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Introducing Dorothy Dandridge"}
{"description": "Somebody in Hollywood thought there was some fish-out-of-water potential in this teaming of wild man Woody Harrelson and slow-burning Kiefer Sutherland as a pair of New Mexico cowboys who go to New York to tame the wild, wild, uh ... East. Well, they were mistaken, because this 1994 action-comedy is little more than a tiresome reworking ofCrocodile Dundee. Woody and Kiefer head for the Big Apple to rescue the illegal-immigrant daughter of one of their rodeo buddies (who has mysteriously disappeared), and what they discover is a sweatshop operation run by a hot-tempered thug (Dylan McDermott, before his role on TV'sThe Practice). That's when the boys start using their ropin' and shootin' skills to foil the bad guys. One measure of this film's credibility is the inevitable scene of the boys riding on horseback through the gridlocked streets of Manhattan. Uh huh.  You know how it goes... you just have to go with it or marvel at the sheer stupidity of it all. Of course, forget all the sniping if you're a fan of Harrelson or Sutherland--they're both doing their best under the burden of disadvantage.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00002SSKG"], "bought_together": ["B00002SSKG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 292354}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.95, "brand": "", "asin": "0783211694", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5156DGQ5TPL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Cowboy Way [VHS]"}

{"description": "Even more than most of David Lynch's deliberately bizarre and idiosyncratic movies,Duneis a &quot;love-it-or-hate-it&quot; affair. An ambitious, epic, utterly mind-boggling--and, let's admit it, all-out weird--adaptation of Frank Herbert's classic science fiction novel,Duneremains one of the most controversial films in the director's exceedingly provocative career. The story (ifDunecan be said to have just one story) is complex and convoluted in the epic tradition; it has something to do with political intrigue and a planet that is home to a precious spice and gigantic sand worms. Think Shakespeare'sHenry IVwith a dash ofTremors, and set in another galaxy. But despite plenty of strangely whispered voice-overs that explain the characters' thoughts (and endlessly detailed exposition), storytelling is not really among the film's strong points. There are, however, a lot of memorably fantastic/grotesque images, an extraordinary cast, and a soundtrack featuring Toto. I told you it was weird. Among the stars are Kyle MacLachlan, Jos&eacute; Ferrer, Dean Stockwell, Brad Dourif, Sting, Kenneth McMillan, Patrick Stewart, Sean Young, and Linda Hunt.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B00008RUYH", "B0000639EV", "B000053V8F"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 538359}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.47, "brand": "", "asin": "0783221487", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41N8H8B2GML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Dune (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]"}

That lapse proves unfortunate, but there's no shortage of raw terror as a rampaging T-rex and nasty raptors try to make fast food out of the cast.

{"description": "Ranked 34 on the American Film Institute's list of the 100 Greatest American Films,To Kill a Mockingbirdis quite simply one of the finest family-oriented dramas ever made. A beautiful and deeply affecting adaptation of the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by Harper Lee, the film retains a timeless quality that transcends its historically dated subject matter (racism in the Depression-era South) and remains powerfully resonant in present-day America with its advocacy of tolerance, justice, integrity, and loving, responsible parenthood. It's tempting to call this an important &quot;message&quot; movie that should be required viewing for children and adults alike, but this riveting courtroom drama is anything but stodgy or pedantic. As Atticus Finch, the small-town Alabama lawyer and widower father of two, Gregory Peck gives one of his finest performances with his impassioned defense of a black man (Brock Peters) wrongfully accused of the rape and assault of a young white woman. While his children, Scout (Mary Badham) and Jem (Philip Alford), learn the realities of racial prejudice and irrational hatred, they also learn to overcome their fear of the unknown as personified by their mysterious, mostly unseen neighbor Boo Radley (Robert Duvall, in his brilliant, almost completely nonverbal screen debut). What emerges from this evocative, exquisitely filmed drama is a pure distillation of the themes of Harper Lee's enduring novel, a showcase for some of the finest American acting ever assembled in one film, and a rare quality of humanitarian artistry (including Horton Foote's splendid screenplay and Elmer Bernstein's outstanding score) that seems all but lost in the chaotic morass of modern cinema.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305123616", "6301797906", "6304119046", "630150528X", "6300183513", "6300181340", "0800132009", "6301720555", "6301975987", "079284517X", "6301971736", "B000006GCU", "0783235607", "6300181286", "0800100832", "6300270971", "0792839846", "6301976932", "6302909023", "6301977297", "6301976983", "0783221347", "6300182304", "6300183629", "6304117752", "6303560040", "6304429274", "0782008348", "6300181278", "6301976061", "1558807780", "6302226899", "6304151306", "6303257844", "0790743159", "0783236352", "6301586026", "1569942072", "6300214060", "B000006N70", "0800125762", "0790733935", "6302150620", "6303168507", "6301964012", "B00005LCBP", "6301773586", "B002NZK5VO", "630197350X", "B007Y1NR1W", "0790748169", "0446310786", "6300267857", "B00066FBQG", "0792133153", "B00AEBB932", "6304259131", "B00001OWYM", "6303020089", "B00003UCB0", "630310696X", "630021639X", "6301797957", "B00005NQGQ", "079212569X", "0767825616", "6301978633", "B00004TYS8", "6305718792", "0792108868", "6305050023", "6304383177", "B000EO7AIC", "0792108280", "6301661729", "6302529484", "6304457383", "0790731975", "6303382940", "0792844645", "0792116887", "6303269834", "0792837630", "6302843200", "630197333X", "B00003CXFU", "6300269310", "6301977815", "6300267970", "B000005PFL", "0782006779", "6303313345", "6300214435", "6301670159", "B000003KHS", "630027120X", "6304429711", "B0000040EO", "630157401X"], "bought_together": ["6305123616"], "also_viewed": ["0446310786", "6305123616", "0783235607", "6302226899", "0783221347", "6300215814", "0800100832", "0783216084", "6302909023", "630150528X", "0792839846", "0800132009", "6304117752", "0792837096", "B000FQJAIW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 157532}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.63, "brand": "Universal International Home Video", "asin": "0783222955", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51C084T8V7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]"}

{"description": "Unfairly dismissed by a number of critics,Two Minute Warningis  an absorbing contemplation of the phenomenon of violence. Based on a novel by George LaFountaine, the story concerns an anonymous (and, until the very end, faceless) sniper perched above the scoreboard at a championship football game in Los Angeles. His lack of identity and unstated motivation is key to the film's air of cautionary fable, in which the killer's rage is one end of a continuum that includes many different kinds of violence among numerous characters: emotional withdrawal, police brutality, subtle racism, chips on various shoulders. Produced in 1976, the movie has all the hallmarks of the decade's vogue for disaster flicks: an ensemble cast, a web of story lines, and a lot of people contained in one place where something awful happens. But it is also something more: a successful exercise in plastic storytelling, a clever interweaving of a dozen discrete subplots with a mix of documentary and original action footage. The explosiveness of the football game itself becomes a refrain of ritualized mayhem in director Larry Peerce's patchwork film, but without beating us over the head with its metaphorical obviousness.Two Minute Warningmay not be a great or classic work, but it is far more than the sum of its many parts and does leave a lasting impression.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEFXJF4", "0783229399", "B0033YFI6Q", "B000OHZJO6", "B000ETRA5U", "B0050MB5N4", "B00AFEYS9A", "0792843649", "B001KO1BCG", "B0006HBZBK", "B001PYD0PC", "B004OB2EYQ", "0783229372", "B00JJOY4RI", "B00008L3UQ", "B008SAPCTS", "B0003JANSW", "B003GWE582", "B000NTPG7K", "B005OT7ZWI", "B00005M2CO", "B00004XPPE", "B007HCI42A", "B00AEBB86U", "B000EHSVOG", "B0001FGBWK", "B0024FAG2Q", "B001NY4WYC", "0767824555", "B004GW49K0", "B00319ECCY", "B000HT38CQ", "B00005JMA5", "0783230346", "B0045HCJKS", "B0009GX1CE", "B001T21R50", "B004I1K05W", "B00G575PD4", "B00004ZBVG", "B00AIBZMD6", "B000P0J0BU", "B00005V9HJ", "B00008438U", "B00021R7CG", "B00005LIRC", "B0053ENPPA", "B003A0H04Q", "B0007ZEOC8", "B000QUCRB4", "B00005YUNO", "B005152C9G", "B00AEFY6DI", "B00AEFY9YY", "B004MFFB4O", "B00AEFY0KW", "B0000AMRUP", "B00BWJQEFS", "B001CQONHM", "B000E6ESEO", "B00AEFYTMQ", "B00A50PDS4", "B004I1K066", "B00008G6E8", "B0001FGC1U", "B000N3SROA", "B000O599YY", "B000TUDBFC", "0792844017", "B000AQKU72", "B00018D3YG", "B00501SPQA", "B000EXDSCU", "B003GWF2QQ", "B0006B2A42", "6305161984", "B00BWJQEFI", "B000M341R8", "B003B3NV8G", "B00AEFYR3C", "B00006FD9O", "078323208X", "B001EKP5D2", "B00CSW0A8A", "B004VT9JMG", "B00AEFY3TA", "B005DL6PLY", "B0077HQCYM", "B003VJTGNE", "B00005LC4D", "B00BCMT2BI", "B000EHSVSC", "B00008MTVY", "B00BCMT3TO", "B00005UQ9T", "B002EAYDQ6", "B000F6ZIIS", "B00DOZNJ2Y", "B0007PALZW", "B00AEFXLKC"], "bought_together": ["B00AEFXJF4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AEFXJF4", "B00AEFYTMQ", "B0001FGC1U", "B0033YFI6Q"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 163962}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.41, "brand": "UNI DIST CORP.

{"description": "Directed by Sidney Lumet (Serpico) and penned by Joel Schumacher (Batman and Robin), this lavish 1978 adaptation of the Broadway hitThe Wizwas the biggest production filmed in New York City up to that point, utilizing the newly revamped Astoria Studios and locations around the city. Diana Ross, Michael Jackson, Nipsey Russell, and Ted Ross (reprising his Tony-winning role as the Lion) star in this Academy Award-nominated musical for the whole family.The Wizis probably the grandest take on L.&nbsp;Frank Baum's classic  taleThe Wizard of Oz.  The  production team created sets with a sense of urban magic and spectacle: a New York subway station literally comes to life, and the massive plaza between the World Trade Center towers is transformed into the Emerald City, featuring nearly 400 dancers with three costume changes. Like all good musicals, theQuincy Jones arrangementsare highly hummable long after viewing (especially the funky \"Ease On Down the Road\" and the inspirational \"Brand New Day\"). In an era before MTV, the camera stays nearly stationary as Ross and Lena Horne vocally soar through their numbers. Their stage-like performances successfully make the leap to film, makingThe Wiza testament to their singing talents and star presence. The then-thirtysomething Ross raised some eyebrows playing the traditionally teenaged Dorothy, but she and her supporting cast (including Richard Pryor as the Wiz) carry the tunes with an infectious verve that will appeal to folks of all ages.--Shannon Gee", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000B5XOSY", "B00004Z4SE", "B000002I8P", "B000002P75", "B00CNW9ZI6", "B00007AJG2", "B0084NZEE2", "B0033TJATW", "B00005A1T0", "B000JLTRH2", "B002CWKU36", "B0000VCZKM", "B00005TQ44", "B00008CMRM", "B0000DZ3EN", "B007OAAK0O", "B000BUE5FA", "B00465I1CE", "B002TYZKIM", "B00005RIIY", "0573680914", "B00441GZ1Y", "B002LFJXL4", "B00C7JGDBW", "B0000TWMQ6", "B000BNTMAA", "B000BOH922", "B00005JO4H", "B005F96UJ6", "B000Y11B8K", "B0000AM6IY", "B002LFJXKU", "B0002HCWQQ", "B003YCL0SM", "B000065V3J", "B00000J2KE", "B0000W5J4A", "B000A2RRF4", "B00066FAOE", "B00014X83G", "B000667HHW", "B00JDB4PEY", "B0030A0ZD4", "B00005RDAN", "B002D0L0R2", "1476705968", "1849382611", "B00465I192", "B0009A40NO", "B000056WR6", "B00BYS0RQE", "B000GDI27E", "076781326X", "B001DJLD12", "B003NH42HE", "B00003L9CK", "B004498KPU", "B00006RJAA", "B00004XMTJ", "B00E1HIX66", "B0084I9QIW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00004Z4SE", "B00CNW9ZI6", "B0033TJATW", "B00JDB4PEY"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 64202}, "asin": "0783233493", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/610WYFVWY5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Wiz"}
{"description": "Director Rob Reiner'sWhen Harry Met Sally...was about a relationship beginning;The Story of Usis about a relationship possibly coming to an end. Bruce Willis plays a comedy writer who chafes at what he sees as his wife's lack of spontaneity; Michelle Pfeiffer, who creates crossword puzzles, stews over what she sees as her husband's irresponsibility. The arc of their separation is interspliced with glimpses and scenes from their marriage--a combination of high points (the proposal, the births of their two children), low points (screaming fights), and the in-between (sessions with marriage counselors, moments in bed staring at the TV). Reiner indicates the passage of time by Willis and Pfeiffer's various hairstyles, and they occasionally let their hair act for them, but at other points their performances are sincere and deeply felt. The sheer power of the themes--the inevitability of conflict in a relationship, the necessity and difficulty of growth--give the movie a degree of emotional force, and there's no doubt that everyone who's gone through a difficult period in their marriage (which is just about every married couple) will find something to connect with. However, there isn't a lot of chemistry between the two leads. In one sequence Willis and Pfeiffer go to Venice to rekindle their old spark and find themselves hounded by another couple, the Kirbys from Cleveland, who are loud, crass, boring, and oblivious. Nonetheless, the Kirbys have a buoyancy that the glossy and elegant stars never quite manage; ifThe Story of Ushad been the story of them, it might have been a better story to watch.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B00000F5MN", "B004GSVXCG", "B00319ECB0", "6305428034", "6305692572", "B00AEBBA2W", "B0099114WO", "B00006ZXSN", "B003BV8ICC", "6305428271", "B00005JCCB", "B0019PL2QQ", "B002UZCJ8Y", "B002K0WBXM", "B0043X1FLI", "B003C27X44", "B00005JKTP", "B0058ZPNBI", "B0009ETCUQ", "B00003CXQA", "B00AEBB9WI", "0767821718", "0767821513", "1558908331", "0767817761", "B000095WW8", "0790742446", "B0045HCJIK", "B000B2YR92", "B005F2JRUC", "B00006ZXSO", "B00AEFYXJ0", "6305428484", "B003YKYX9M", "B000U1ZV80", "B000BRP4BM", "B000087F7E", "B00002Z88B", "B00AEBB8NS", "B000NO39FG", "B00006ZXSI", "B009HIKAN8", "B002FU8IWU", "B002AS466O", "B00AEFYF2K", "B004499LWG", "B00000IQV7", "6301971345", "B000RO9Q7W", "0783226888", "B00096S49Y", "0767807588", "6304698747", "B002NZK5TQ", "B00008CMRK", "B000LP6KMQ", "B0001AVZA8", "B00AG51V8E", "0767815122"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00000F5MN", "B004GSVXCG", "B00319ECB0", "B000YDBPAM"]}, "price": 6.66, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 690149}, "asin": "0783240031", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41RPKQX44DL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Story of Us"}
{"description": "In this raucous, high-energy action thriller from 1991, Michael J. Fox plays a spoiled Hollywood movie star who wants to bring vivid authenticity to his latest role as a big-city cop, so he recruits the real thing (James Woods) as his experienced mentor. This unlikely partnership doesn't sit too well with Woods, a hot-headed New York street cop who's a magnet for action-packed trouble. But that makes him just the right guy for Fox's research, which goes so far as to include Woods's girlfriend (Annabella Sciorra) and participation in some death-defying crime work. Fast, vulgar, and cranked at high volume, this is the kind of movie that contributed to the destruction of quality storytelling in mainstream Hollywood movies, but the screenplay scores bonus points for its lively characters and even livelier dialogue. Director John Badham is no slouch when it comes to action scenes, either, so if you buckle up and hold on tight, doing thingsThe Hard Waycan be surprisingly entertaining. To display the action in full widescreen glory, the DVD presents the film in its original 2.35:1 aspect ratio.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783229364", "B000063JDG", "6305133468", "B000065V3E", "B00009AOBM", "0783230354", "B000065V3F", "B00009AOBH", "078322799X", "B00026ZG10", "B00JPQ1I7O", "0783227396", "B0009PVZD2", "B00015YVDG", "B000ALM4DK", "B002AS466O", "B00441GYZG", "B00000IQW2", "B00029RT9E", "B00020HAWO", "6305236569", "B00009MEKO", "B0001WTVGG", "B0029B31HM", "B00005N89R", "B0000648ZQ", "B0008KLVAU", "6304711891", "6304806450", "B004ZRFQCG", "B0015RRN9S", "B000B8GT92", "B002AO7QBA", "6305428441", "B00005V9HS", "B004X63SKQ", "B000ELL1R6", "B0003JANSW", "B00020HB4Q", "B005FT2MJ8", "B000K7VHTQ", "0767810848", "B001D2WUDE", "B0000DD76S", "0790730979", "B00008CMRK", "B003AWRMA6", "B0002J58HO", "6305505802", "B0009X75J2", "B008XAT0U0", "B00005JP4N", "B00DW5IJR6", "B00441GYQ0", "B000MGBSE4", "B00AEBB95K", "B000055Y0Y", "B005FQ2H8W", "B000PMFRYW", "B000N60H9U", "B00BLN4V6E", "B001SV3LL0", "157362876X", "B00002E23C", "B00005JCCB", "B00CPTUNZG", "B003NNCLAS", "B00008L3S6", "155890834X", "B00919TING", "0767817648", "B0000399WA", "B002AS464Q", "B000ZM1MG4", "B008FYZHDI", "B00008978M", "6305161984", "B004FQX59I", "B0001IN0S0", "B00158K0QU", "B00HGB9NB8", "B000QXDCJ2", "B005OT80W2", "B000063JDO", "B00AEFXRWO", "B0006HBZBK", "0783230079", "B00005IA7Y", "B00004STDN", "B0017CW5H6", "B000P0J0D8", "6305127646", "B00004TX5G", "630516200X", "B00005T7HZ", "0792844831", "0767807588", "B00008L3SA", "B00008DDXA", "B00BTYJYP8"], "bought_together": ["0783229364", "6305133468"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000N60H9U", "6305133468", "0783229364", "B00319ECII"]}, "price": 9.68, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 30970}, "asin": "0783230060", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51D60Q7W0KL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Hard Way"}

{"description": "With vanity projects like 1989's schlockyLock Upto his credit, it's a wonder Sylvester Stallone survived to make some better movies in the '90s.  This is a brutal dose of macho action that Stallone squeezed in betweenRambo IIIandRocky V, and his fans didn't seem to mind, so who's to judge? It's not as bad as Sly's other 1989 disaster (Tango & Cash), but you'd have to be demented, drunk, or have really low standards to call this a good movie. But if you're in a primal mood you'll get a kick out of this grimy flick, which would qualify as Z-grade exploitation if it weren't for Stallone's beefy presence as Frank Leone, a cooperative prisoner who's six months shy of parole when he's relocated to a hellhole called Gateway Prison. The wretched high-security facility is commandeered by Warden Drumgoole (Donald Sutherland), who is determined to settle an old score with Stallone ... and you can pretty much guess the rest. Director John Flynn didn't exactly distinguish himself with this one (he'd go on to direct forgettable fare likeOut for JusticeandBrainscan), but there's more visual style here than you might expect, and Sly manages to take it all so seriously that you can easily enjoy this gut buster as an unintentional comedy.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0045HCJG2", "0783226934", "B00004STDN", "B004SIP6WW", "B002GHHHH4", "B0045HCJ5S", "B000056PNL", "1558908846", "B000U1ZV62", "B0006IIPL2", "B0001FGBWK", "B000BMY2N8", "B00315462E", "6304779631", "B0000VV5BM", "B000R348QW", "6304602944", "B00003CXTM", "B00DYXCHN8", "B0045HCJGC", "B00H1RMWYW", "B00441GYY2", "B0015XHP2C", "B00004RE45", "B0004Z33G4", "B0006GAOGS", "B0004Z33EQ", "B0015XHP4A", "B000QXDCLU", "B002ZG999U", "B0002J58HO", "B0045HCIXG", "B0002S94CK", "B00AEFYDM2", "B00013RC8E", "B0006GAOG8", "B00008979E", "B001B3LIOC", "B009MF5BXK", "B000N4SHPS", "B0000542CC", "B0006GAOGI", "B00HWWUR02", "B0006GAO6I", "B008NP4ZUU", "6305259429", "B002TVQ4CG", "0783228686", "076780970X", "6305767866", "B000E0WJLE", "B004GJYRK0", "B0006GANOQ", "B000056PMU", "0060737875", "B00H91LWDC", "6304806434", "B000RW3VCK", "B0000VV55I", "B00070FX5U", "B0004Z33EG", "B0050MB5NO", "B00BLF9FOK", "B001M9ELQC", "B00AEFXVOI", "6304884400", "B0099KJFJ4", "0767807588", "B00AKGG828", "B00006RCOC", "B00HF98SHG", "0790729334", "B00441GYZG", "B002G1WPIG", "B0000542CD", "B00008978T", "B00D3LA6RK", "0783227345", "B0000VV5DA", "B00005JKIP", "B000XT1P4S", "B000059H9A", "B00BUC4TJ0", "B00008MTYF", "B000U1ZV8K", "0783226748", "B00003CXW4", "B00005N5QW", "B000BPL2FQ", "B0004Z33F0", "B000RJO56E", "0783228465", "B0006GAO5Y", "B0009UZG32", "B000274T94", "B0045HCIWM", "B00A34LX9A", "B00596WEVI", "B0090EDEM8", "B00AEFXX9Q"], "bought_together": ["B0045HCJG2", "B002GHHHH4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00004STDN", "B002GHHHH4", "1558908846", "B0045HCJG2"]}, "price": 39.95, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 383127}, "asin": "0784011230", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51H50DRTVNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Lock Up"}

{"description": "Writer Ernest Thompson, who came up with the original stage play ofOn Golden Pondand adapted it for film, is lucky to have two giants of the screen give dignity and breadth to his sometimes trite dialogue. Henry Fonda, in his last role, plays a prickly English professor at the disagreeable age of 80. Visiting his summer house by a Maine lake with his wife (Katharine Hepburn), the old man forges an unlikely bond with a lonely boy, comes to terms with his daughter (Jane Fonda), and suffers disorienting effects of mild dementia. Even playing a tired old man, Fonda is an absolute lion of a movie star, and Hepburn brings her special spirit to the part of his worried bride. The onscreen relationship between Henry and Jane Fonda naturally makes one think about their much-discussed difficulties offscreen, but that's a side benefit in a movie that is really just a celebration of simple human decency. Directed by Mark Rydell (Harry and Walter Go to New York).--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002VWNIBI", "6305212112", "B00001W9G0", "B003ASLJK4", "B00DDT0JB0", "B00AEFYK5M", "B0001CNRBG", "B00005NRN8", "B00004TJKK", "B00AEBB9FA", "0767836359", "0783240171", "B0045HCJ76", "B00AEFY4CG", "B0007QJ1XE", "B000765IJK", "B00AEFY0F2", "076780676X", "B000ZM1MG4", "6305128952", "B006FE83UE", "B002GHHHGU", "B001ECDVK4", "0822208482", "B004SIP6C2", "B00AEFXD1O", "B00AEFXYOA", "B002VWNIAY", "B000TXP56C", "B003LMPKSQ", "B000YAF4MA", "B00AEFY8ZE", "B0000DIXDR", "6305236569", "B00AKGG5WG", "B002NZK5RS", "B00005MEOU", "B0000AOV4I", "B004AOECXI", "B00008CMSX", "B000JYW5B4", "B000QQLVPQ", "B00AEFYRJQ", "B00CPTUOI2", "6304698607", "B0000542C9", "0783225733", "B003BV8ICC", "B00079Z9VO", "B000FOPPC4", "B00AEFYXJ0", "B0000648ZR", "B00AEBB97S", "B004SEUJOQ", "B00004W46I", "B000YDBPAM", "B00066FAOE", "B007STBUHI", "B0007ZEOPK", "B007N31YH0", "B000BITVAG", "B00AEBBA0E", "B002M2Z3BA", "0790731886", "B00004RG62", "B0009R1TJ0", "B00070HK24", "B00009AVA5", "B009ERK1ZO", "B00004XPPC", "B00FEDP5XK", "B000Y11BBW", "B00AATV046", "B0000YTP02", "B001JNNDLU", "B0028ZDJN0", "B0013D8LH2", "B0001AVZA8", "B0006J28LO", "B000WTVZHQ", "B0057P4SAQ", "B0001I55R4", "B00005V5NS", "B00AEFYNG8", "B007XTDWKQ", "B001ECDVJU", "0783230486", "B00066FBQG"], "bought_together": ["B002VWNIBI", "6305212112"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00DDT0JB0", "B00AEFYK5M", "B00004TJKK", "B003ASLJK4"]}, "price": 24.5, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 133435}, "asin": "0784011648", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51JR83516RL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "On Golden Pond"}

{"description": "This classic 1963 Disney film features child icon Hayley Mills  as Nancy Carey, a teenage girl whose family moves from Boston  to the New England countryside as a result of their father's untimely  passing.  Nancy writes to the kindly Mr.&nbsp;Poppem (Burl Ives) and  single-handedly convinces him to rent the family a charming, if run-down,  house for a mere $60 a year. Ever the optimist, Nancy brims with  excitement at the family's new life, but this \"perfect world\" has its  problems--notably an absentee landlord who knows nothing about the Carey  family's rental agreement.  Through hard work and Mr.&nbsp;Poppem's continuing  generosity, the Careys fix up the house and find life in the rural Maine  town quite satisfactory.  Things become tense when their cousin Julia arrives  for an extended visit, but eventually Nancy and Julia grow from one  another's experiences and become good friends. You'll never guess what  happens when the absent landlord returns unannounced during the family's  Halloween housewarming party!One section that may sit poorly with modern audiences features Nancy and  Julia discussing how to emphasize one's femininity at the expense of hiding the real you--an indication of how much American thinking has changed in a  relatively short period of time.  Nevertheless, this is a charming tale  featuring toe-tapping ragtime music, wonderful songs by Richard&nbsp;M. Sherman and Robert&nbsp;B. Sherman including \"Summer Magic\"  and \"The Ugly Bug Ball,\" and the incomparable talents of Mills and Ives.  Take a trip down memory lane and don't forget the kids.

{"description": "The three-day Woodstock music festival in 1969 was the pivotalevent of the 1960s peace movement, and this landmark concert film is the definitive record of that milestone of rock & roll history.  It's more than a chronicle of the hippie movement, however; this is a film of genuine historical and social importance, capturing the spirit of America in transition, when the Vietnam War was at its peak and antiwar protest was fully expressed through the liberating music of the time. With a brilliant crew at his disposal (including a young editor named Martin Scorsese), director Michael Wadleigh worked with over 300 hours of footage to create his original 225-minute director's cut, which was cut by 40 minutes for the film's release in 1970. Eight previously edited segments were restored in 1994, and the original director's cut of Woodstock is now the version most commonly available on videotape and DVD.The film deservedly won the Academy Award for Best Documentary, and it's still a stunning achievement.  Abundant footage taken among the massive crowd (\"half a million strong\") expresses the human heart of the event, from skinny-dipping hippies to accidental overdoses, to unpredictable weather, midconcert childbirth, and the thoughtful (or just plain rambling) reflections of the festive participants. Then, of course, there is the music--a nonstop parade of rock & roll from the greatest performers of the period, including Crosby, Stills, and Nash, Canned Heat, The Who, Richie Havens, Joan Baez, Ten Years After, Sly & The Family Stone, Santana, and many more. Watching this ambitious film, as the saying goes, is the next best thing to being there--it's a time-travel journey to that once-in-a-lifetime event.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00274SHKM", "B00006JU7P", "B001TLWR46", "B00004YZFR", "B002SQ364Q", "B000E5LEWE", "B00003CXB1", "B0013K1ALE", "B00274SHKC", "B0009PBLZE", "B003NOGNX8", "B00DSS7B0S", "B002IZ1RMU", "0783233485", "1573306932", "B003VRV9FY", "B0084NZEWO", "B000AM6N9U", "B0002234XQ", "B000B8IANU", "B000OCY668", "B000AYQJ3I", "B0000CEB4V", "B0014DZ2XC", "B00L47E6IA", "B008PALH1I", "B001FWRZ14", "630463949X", "B000621484", "B002E01M9C", "B005IT63GI", "B001XJEKGC", "B000KJU1HI", "B001V7P2MM", "B00F031WB8", "B0090O07S2", "B0002WZTJI", "B00HQI823Q", "B00KF1CWF0", "B0028LN3AS", "B0019Y1I4S", "B00007LTIL", "B000A0GP4K", "B000654YR4", "B00005NB8K", "B000BTC5LW", "B00H3JHH6Q", "B000305ZDO", "B00003OSU4", "B0006ZE7G2", "B000VI6T6U", "B0002Z9HT8", "B0085KGHI6", "B00000K3TV", "B000MWKCFO", "B003DC8D7Y", "B001NHZ2KM", "B000BM7U82", "B0030ATZIA", "B009186JYI", "0060755229", "B00IPL286U", "B00008PX8P", "B000022TSY", "B0052Y0FJ0", "B005HI4LLO", "B0000DJZ81", "B00008J2HC", "B00008GKEG", "B00ARX2W9C", "B001FWRZ0U", "B0000062FJ", "B00092ZMDY", "B0009E3234", "B0002GTX8C", "B000021Y7X", "B002IR3PSC", "B0002V7ON8", "B000SQD13E", "B003152Z4K", "6305076995", "B00AU15GLC", "B000001DUP", "6305747172", "B0007Z0VVQ", "B00AKRQJOO", "B00004W50T", "6305019681", "B00JZO33VK", "6305610460", "B00KCUGSTA", "B0000584ZV", "B00B08FLVO", "B003ELKNH2", "B003H5WF3U", "B00004XMSE", "0811848248", "B0007GADZE", "B0000DBJDM"], "bought_together": ["B00274SHKM"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00274SHKM", "B001V7P2MC", "B00DSS7B0S", "B00274SHKC"]}, "price": 47.85, "categories": [["CDs & Vinyl", "Rock"], ["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 129421}, "asin": "0790729350", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61CHJRGEDWL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Woodstock - 3 Days of Peace &amp; Music (The Director's Cut)"}
{"description": "When it was announced that Tom Cruise would play the vampire Lestat in this adaptation of Anne Rice's bestselling novel, even Rice chimed in with a highly publicized objection. The author wisely and justifiably recanted her negative opinion when she saw Cruise's excellent performance, which perceptively addresses the pain and chronic melancholy that plagues anyone cursed with immortal bloodlust. Brad Pitt and Kirsten Dunst are equally good at maintaining the dark and brooding tone of Rice's novel. And in this rare mainstream project for a major studio, director Neil Jordan compensates for a lumbering plot by honoring the literate, Romantic qualities of Rice's screenplay. Considered a disappointment while being embraced by Rice's loyal followers, the movie is too slow to be a satisfying thriller, but it is definitely one of the most lavish, intelligent horror films ever made.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000069I1I", "B000TGJ80S", "B00027JZ3E", "B00AEBBA72", "B0050MB3MM", "B0002KVUKM", "B002U4UZSQ", "6305258287", "B0009MDPYM", "B002ZG97CO", "B00004WG2F", "B001VLFE7G", "B00005JM5B", "B0085A9HU6", "B00006JDU8", "B00011CZRE", "B005CFBZWK", "0783229526", "B00AEFYMGO", "0345385403", "B004P7CMOQ", "B0009A40ES", "B002GSXKNI", "B001GCUO0W", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00AEBB8NI", "B00005JL78", "B004BLJQOK", "B005COLESQ", "0783233477", "B003Y5H5EW", "B000BRBA9C", "B004P7CN7W", "0767811097", "0345337662", "B004P7CN5O", "B002T9H2LA", "B00004W4UD", "B004QSQMKE", "B002AF4Y9G", "0800177789", "B000035Z5G", "B000BKVQS4", "B00003CXSD", "B00001PE4D", "0800141806", "B00BHBOOIU", "B000P0J0EM", "B003M987PQ", "B006VRRGNK", "B008QE9XD2", "0792839137", "B00005JLKN", "B002O3Z4ZW", "0783225482", "B00AEFY4CG", "B00009AOBI", "6305313687", "B0002KVULG", "B001AGXEAG", "B00005JLSB", "B00018D42W", "B00AEBBAEK", "B003Y5H54W", "B00AEFY5B6", "B002VWNIDG", "B00AEFXYJA", "0800177029", "B000JLQQ94", "6305718954", "B000OCY7TY", "B000NOKFHQ", "B000P0J0D8", "B001GZ6QC4", "B00003CXWV", "B000AYELVA", "B005NKIPUY", "B0013FCWUW", "B0007WFX62", "B008R65XYC", "B0041KKYEM", "B00BZZMXMW", "B002NZK5V4", "B000P0J09M", "B00000G3R0", "B00005UQ9W", "0345443683", "B004SIP7TE", "B0001US62I", "B003PIUINS", "0307291650", "B000FKO5QK", "B0012Q7M02", "B0000AC8LI", "B001MYIXAC", "B005LAIHXQ", "B0009X76XC", "B000FFJYBG", "B002NZK5VO", "B00AEFXQ9S"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000069I1I", "B00011CZRE", "B00004WG2F", "B000P0J09M"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 82136}, "asin": "0790729687", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516RX1MMY2L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Interview With the Vampire"}
{"description": "Martin Scorsese's 1990 masterpieceGoodFellasimmortalizes the hilarious, horrifying life of actual gangster Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), from his teen years on the streets of New York to his anonymous exile under the Witness Protection Program. The director's kinetic style is perfect for recounting Hill's ruthless rise to power in the 1950s as well as his drugged-out fall in the late 1970s; in fact, no one has ever rendered the mental dislocation of cocaine better than Scorsese. Scorsese uses period music perfectly, not just to summon a particular time but to set a precise mood.GoodFellasis at least as good asThe Godfatherwithout being in the least derivative of it. Joe Pesci's psycho improvisation of Mobster Tommy DeVito ignited Pesci as a star, Lorraine Bracco scores the performance of her life as the love of Hill's life, and every supporting role, from Paul Sorvino to Robert De Niro, is a miracle.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000C20VPA", "B000C20VRS", "B008R65XYC", "B000M341QE", "B0018CMJSU", "B0019L770A", "B0019L21GA", "B00004XPPB", "B000P0J0AG", "B0000DI87S", "B000P0J0EW", "B00003CXWV", "B00CCMKPO0", "B00G1C2URC", "B00004U103", "B00AEBB9NM", "B004SIP95G", "B002CPMB9O", "B0019L21H4", "B007TBIUSM", "B000286RP2", "B00011CZRE", "B004SIP8ZM", "B0006GAOJA", "B002T9H2LA", "B006TTC5HC", "B002VWNIEA", "0767830555", "B0000AMJEK", "B0000AM6JI", "B00005V9HH", "B004FQX5B6", "B000SFOW8I", "B00008975Z", "B002CA68N4", "6305313687", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00013RC2U", "0792174909", "B007D0FVRM", "B000A7DVR2", "B004G7XCRQ", "B002QEHPQU", "B003ASLJO0", "B000LP6KNU", "B000H5TH20", "B000P0J09C", "6305263248", "0783229526", "B00009W5CA", "B001C0I61M", "B000EHSVRI", "B00IEK9U0E", "B002ZG980U", "B004SIP7TE", "B004SIP7ZS", "B0006GAO5Y", "B00B0U2SFE", "B000ERVKBC", "B000A2UBN4", "B002AF4Y9G", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B0000714BS", "B000E5KQHI", "B00005JA8B", "B002O3Z4Y8", "B003AWRMCE", "B000P0J0EM", "1558908390", "B00080ZG10", "0767802519", "B003ELKNH2", "B003BV8I3Q", "B000035Z5G", "B00AEFXDO6", "B000E8NRBC", "B00000JGHV", "B00004RJ71", "B00AEBB9CS", "B004SIP93S", "B00AEFYSEA", "B004SIP6WW", "B003ASLJQS", "B0001Z4OXS", "B002VWNIDG", "0783225946", "B00AEBB9ZK", "B00AEFXXMI", "B0000A02TZ", "B000MZHW40", "B004SIP6GI", "B002ZG99N6", "B00AEBB95K", "B00AEFXP8K", "B00BB67UNW", "B00029RTAI", "B000P0J0D8", "B003ASLJOU", "B000Z8GZYW", "B003ASLJS6"], "bought_together": ["B000C20VPA", "B000C20VRS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000M341QE", "B0018CMJSU", "B000P0J0EW", "B00BCB1JJW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 120285}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.49, "brand": "WARNER STUDIOS", "asin": "0790729725", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41YHNBJW24L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "GoodFellas"}
{"description": "Stanley Kubrick'sThe Shiningis less an adaptation of Stephen King's bestselling horror novel than a complete reimagining of it from the inside out. In King's book, the Overlook Hotel is a haunted place that takes possession of its off-season caretaker and provokes him to murderous rage against his wife and young son. Kubrick's movie is an existential Road Runner cartoon (his steadicam scurrying through the hotel's labyrinthine hallways), in which the cavernously empty spaces inside the Overlook mirror the emptiness in the soul of the blocked writer, who's settled in for a long winter's hibernation. As many have pointed out, King's protagonist goes mad, but Kubrick's Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) is Looney Tunes from the moment we meet him--all arching eyebrows and mischievous grin. (Both Nicholson and Shelley Duvall reach new levels of hysteria in their performances, driven to extremes by the director's fanatical demands for take after take after take.)The Shiningis terrifying--but not in the way fans of the novel might expect. When it was redone as a TV miniseries (reportedly because of King's dissatisfaction with the Kubrick film), the famous topiary-animal attack (which was deemed impossible to film in 1980) was there--but the deeper horror was lost. Kubrick'sThe Shininggets under your skin and chills your bones; it stays with you, inhabits you, haunts you. And there's no place to hide...--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300267881", "0790734079", "B00005ATQA", "6302038308", "6300182770", "B0009RRUKW", "0783235607", "0783228317", "B00000J2KZ", "B00004RNAC", "0790736039", "B00023NRSM", "6304508611", "6300182878", "6302921058", "6304509154", "0783216084", "6300214087", "B00004W5UA", "6301427076", "630268644X", "B000003KHS", "B000AMW2TK", "0790700506", "6300181340", "6300214753", "6302054982", "0784011923", "6305363668", "6303686796", "6305095566", "630021639X", "6302822688", "6305576173", "0783246641", "6304994540", "6303953425", "B00004U8PA", "0792158261", "0792100085", "6300213986", "6300189015", "630533577X", "6300214826", "0792846303", "6304288433", "6300147630", "0792842111", "B000007OY0", "0790741512", "6302158176", "0792846311", "6300183416", "0800103106", "B000005PFL", "6300183211", "0790733927", "6301666569", "6301871952", "0767825411", "630339406X", "6303109950", "6300216500", "6300214192", "6300262731", "6303257674", "6304214502", "630018627X", "6300214311", "1558807381", "0792839234", "0767819187", "B00005B238", "0790731975", "6303579388", "B000059HFB", "6302798450", "B00000FZCU", "6303651461", "6303566391", "6302642175", "6301971582", "6300218058", "6301094352", "6300184064", "6300181278", "6304457383", "6300214672", "6300262855", "0800125762", "6303257305"], "bought_together": ["0790734079"], "also_viewed": ["6300147630", "6300182878", "B00005ATQA", "6300189015", "6300267881", "B00023NRSM", "6300213005", "6303953425", "0307743659", "6303148352", "0790734079", "B001AQT0Z4", "6300183211", "0784011923", "B00BBND56G", "0788806270"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 268792}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.0, "brand": "", "asin": "0790705141", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5106FV0S4PL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Shining [VHS]"}
{"description": "When Ridley Scott's cut ofBlade Runnerwas finally released in 1993, one had to wonder why the studio hadn't done it right the first time--11 years earlier. This version is so much better, mostly because of what's been eliminated (the ludicrous and redundant voice-over narration and the phony happy ending) rather than what's been added (a bit more character development and a brief unicorn dream). Star Harrison Ford originally recorded the narration under duress at the insistence of Warner Bros. executives who thought the story needed further \"explanation\"; he later confessed that he thought if he did it badly they wouldn't use it. (Moral: Never overestimate the taste of movie executives.) The movie's spectacular futuristic vision of Los Angeles--a perpetually dark and rainy metropolis that's the nightmare antithesis of \"Sunny Southern California\"--is still its most seductive feature, an otherworldly atmosphere in which you can immerse yourself. The movie's shadowy visual style, along with its classic private-detective/murder-mystery plot line (with Ford on the trail of a murderous android, or \"replicant\"), makesBlade Runnerone of the few science fiction pictures to legitimately claim a place in the film noir tradition.

{"description": "One of the key movies of the 1970s, when exciting, groundbreaking, personal films were still being made in Hollywood, Milos Forman'sOne Flew over the Cuckoo's Nestemphasized the humanistic story at the heart of Ken Kesey's more hallucinogenic novel. Jack Nicholson was born to play the part of Randle Patrick McMurphy, the rebellious inmate of a psychiatric hospital who fights back against the authorities' cold attitudes of institutional superiority, as personified by Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher). It's the classic antiestablishment tale of one man asserting his individuality in the face of a repressive, conformist system--and it works on every level. Forman populates his film with memorably eccentric faces, and gets such freshly detailed and spontaneous work from his ensemble that the picture sometimes feels like a documentary. Unlike a lot of films pitched at the &quot;youth culture&quot; of the 1970s,One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nestreally hasn't dated a bit, because the qualities of human nature that Forman captures--playfulness, courage, inspiration, pride, stubbornness--are universal and timeless. The film swept the Academy Awards for 1976, winning in all the major categories (picture, director, actor, actress, screenplay) for the first time since Frank Capra'sIt Happened One Nightin 1931.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002VWNIDG", "B000RTB0R6", "B006TTC5HC", "B000FVQLQQ", "B000P0J0EW", "0767830555", "B0043X1FL8", "B00003CWQR", "B004SIP7ZS", "B003ELKNH2", "B0006GAOJA", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00AEFXN9G", "0767811100", "0792833287", "B004SIP95G", "B0000YEEGM", "B00079Z9VO", "0451163966", "B00AEFYSWM", "B000P0J09M", "B008MIMWP8", "B000EHQU0S", "B006FE83UE", "B000M341QE", "B00AEFXESQ", "B00002VWE0", "B004SIP8ZM", "B002VWNIAY", "B00009W5CA", "0764586629", "B000ZM1MGE", "B00011CZRE", "B000P0J09C", "B0008ENHUI", "B00005V9HH", "B0019L770A", "B0019L21GA", "B00AEBB9CS", "B0050FXDDQ", "B000CNESTE", "B0006GANN2", "B000LP6KNU", "B000P0J0EM", "B00000IQV7", "B000055Y0X", "B00001ZWUS", "079073219X", "B0019UGYK0", "079284646X", "B00AEBB9F0", "B003ASLJO0", "B000A7DVR2", "B00AEBB9FA", "B0002B15ZG", "B004U7MR3M", "B000YAF4MA", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00066FBQG", "B00005JKIS", "6305144168", "B004SIP7TE", "B002ZG980U", "B00005ATQB", "B0045HCJ94", "0783229526", "B000A3XY5A", "B000093FLA", "B00026ZD04", "B004L9GMBC", "B0000DI87S", "B00006RCO1", "B0007PALZ2", "B0000JBALO", "B004IFYMYI", "B007N31YH0", "B000P0J0D8", "B000H4JH7Q", "B00B0U2SFE", "0792846443", "B007D0FVRM", "B000022TSY", "B0087ZG7UW", "B0002234LS", "B0045HCJ9E", "B0000A02TZ", "B001GD6VTE", "B00AEFYRP0", "0784011710", "B00009AOAZ", "B00005JLSB", "B000Q678OO", "0792838408", "6305882592", "B003LMPKSQ", "B00005MEOU", "B00AEFYSL8", "B0057ZAA6W", "B001AEF6BI", "B000HC2LHG"], "bought_together": ["B002VWNIDG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000P0J0EW", "0451163966", "B006TTC5HC", "B00AEFY0F2"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 40218}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.24, "brand": "WARNER STUDIOS", "asin": "0790732181", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51pJoIlXFbL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"}
{"description": "Whether or not you can sympathize with its fascistic-vigilante approach to law enforcement,Dirty Harry(directed by star Clint Eastwood's longtime friend and directorial mentor, Don Siegel) is one hell of a cop thriller. The movie makes evocative use of its San Francisco locations as cop Harry Callahan (Eastwood) tracks the elusive &quot;Scorpio killer&quot; who has been terrorizing the city by the Bay. As the psychopath's trail grows hotter, Harry becomes increasingly impatient and intolerant of the frustrating obstacles (departmental red tape, individuals' civil rights) that he feels are keeping him from doing his job. A characteristically taut and tense piece of filmmaking from Siegel (Invasion of the Body Snatchers,The Shootist,Escape from Alcatraz), it also remains a fascinating slice of American pop culture. It was a big hit (followed by four sequels) that obviously reflected--or exploited--the almost obsessive or paranoid fears and frustrations many Americans felt about crime in the streets. At a time when &quot;law and order&quot; was a familiar slogan for political candidates, Harry Callahan may have represented neither, but from his point of view his job was simple: stop criminals. To him that end justified any means he deemed necessary.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["0790733390", "079073172X", "6300216500", "0792836510", "6300269043", "0790751216", "0792837312", "6302890721", "079284100X", "6302054982", "6304429711", "0784011923", "6302610702", "6302360978", "6300182452", "0792110188", "6300263673", "B000005PF5", "0792835077", "B0000068SI", "6303020089", "630442972X", "6300214826", "6300183211", "B000003KDG", "6301976061", "B00000J2KZ", "630118663X", "0790734079", "6303212263", "6300214060", "6301327845", "0783222955", "6300271331", "B00000K2SC", "0792842464", "B000005PJ6", "6304437315", "0792133153", "6301802330", "6304025831", "6300181405", "6302787564", "0790735423", "6303029027", "0792108868", "0790751267", "6304509154", "0790705141", "B000007OY0", "6300269639", "0800100832", "6303686796", "630281622X", "6304258984", "079284517X", "0792839234", "6303920098", "0792110285", "6305622825", "6302712009", "0790733927", "6301586026", "0800125762", "6302596092", "630018224X", "0790748169", "0792839846", "6301971809", "6303506291", "6305576173", "0783223218", "6300214540", "0783241542", "6303313345"], "bought_together": ["0790733390"], "also_viewed": ["079073172X", "B005GJTZZG", "0790737744", "0790751267", "0792836510", "630118663X", "0790733390"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 365837}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.94, "brand": "", "asin": "0790731975", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41VY4VS01BL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Dirty Harry [VHS]"}
{"description": "The satirical sensibilities of writer Peter Shaffer and director Milos Forman (One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest) were ideally matched in this Oscar-winning movie adaptation of Shaffer's hit play about the rivalry between two composers in the court of Austrian Emperor Joseph II--official royal composer Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham), and the younger but superior prodigy Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce). The conceit is absolutely delicious: Salieri secretly loathes Mozart's crude and bratty personality, but is astounded by the beauty of his music. That's the heart of Salieri's torment--although he's in a unique position to recognize and cultivate both Mozart's talent and career, he's also consumed with envy and insecurity in the face of such genius. That such magnificent music should come from such a vulgar little creature strikes Salieri as one of God's cruelest jokes, and it drives him insane.Amadeuscreates peculiar and delightful contrasts between the impeccably re-created details of its lavish period setting and the jarring (but humorously refreshing and unstuffy) modern tone of its dialogue and performances--all of which serve to remind us that these were people before they became enshrined in historical and artistic legend. Jeffrey Jones, best-known as Ferris Bueller's principal, is particularly wonderful as the bumbling emperor (with the voice of a modern midlevel businessman).

{"description": "A gripping true crime yarn, a juicy slice of overheated New York atmosphere, and a splendid showcase for its young actors,Dog Day Afternoonis a minor classic of the 1970s. The opening montage of New York street life (set to Elton John's lazy &quot;Amoreena&quot;) establishes the oppressive mood of a scorching afternoon in the city with such immediacy that you can almost smell the garbage baking in the sun and the water from the hydrants evaporating from the sizzling pavement. Al Pacino plays Sonny, who, along with his rather slow-witted accomplice Sal (John Cazale, familiar as Pacino'sGodfatherbrother Fredo), holds hostages after a botched a bank robbery. Sonny finds himself transformed into a rebel celebrity when his standoff with police (including lead negotiator Charles Durning) is covered live on local television. The movie doesn't appear to be about anything in particular, but it really conveys the feel of wild and unpredictable events unfolding before your eyes, and the whole picture is so convincing and involving that you're glued to the screen. An Oscar winner for original screenplay,Dog Day Afternoonwas also nominated for best picture, actor, supporting actor (Chris Sarandon, as a surprise figure from Sonny's past), editing, and director (Sidney Lumet ofSerpico,Prince of the City,The Verdict, andRunning on Empty).--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["630018627X", "6300216543", "B000003KHS", "6300183211", "630021639X", "0790705141", "6300267881", "6304457375", "0764006770", "0783229585", "6301208773", "B000AMW2TK", "0792845684", "B00000J2KZ", "0792839846", "6301888901", "0790731975", "0783216084", "6301971809", "6303020089", "0800116917", "6303379214", "6301971582", "0792835077", "6300216500", "B00003CXZ3", "B000006ORX", "6304259131", "0792133153", "0783223218", "0790748169", "B00003G1FZ", "6303313345", "6303696813", "B000007PI9"], "bought_together": ["630018627X"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 460635}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.95, "brand": "", "asin": "0790733927", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51YH9ME7MFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Dog Day Afternoon [VHS]"}
{"description": "Falling from the Oscar-winning glory ofDances with Wolvesto the opposite end of the critical and box-office scale, Kevin Costner must have been deeply humbled when this three-hour postapocalyptic tale--his sophomore effort as a director--was greeted with a critical thrashing and tepid audience response. One of the most conspicuous flops of its decade, the 1997 release must have seemed like a sure thing on paper: a kind of futurist Western starring Costner as a charismatic drifter-turned-hero who leads the resistance against a military tyrant (Will Patton) by reviving the long-dormant postal system to reunite isolated communities in their fight for freedom. The movie bombed, but, like many audacious failures, it's got qualities that make it at least partially endearing, and its earnestness (although bordering on corny) keeps it from being entirely silly. Faint praise, perhaps, but Costner's ode to patriotism is occasionally stirring and visually impressive.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303909884", "6305171750", "0792838734", "0792133153", "6301964365"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 380436}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.95, "brand": "", "asin": "0790736489", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21EY2KMF2PL.jpg", "title": "Postman [VHS]"}

{"description": "Although it was unfortunately ignored during its brief theatrical release, this sumptuously seductive production is that rarest of cinematic breeds, the (barely) respectable guilty pleasure. Combining historical fact with hysterical anachronisms of language and mannerism, it's been tailored for maximum contemporary appeal but maintains a lush, romantic feel for its factual 16th-century tale of Venetian love, lust, and political repression. Catherine McCormack (Mel Gibson's ill-fated bride inBraveheart) delivers a star-making performance as the \"dangerous beauty\" who becomes a skillful courtesan to pursue her forbidden love for a dashing Venetian senator (Rufus Sewell). It's all rather silly in a high-toned fashion, and the film turns dour when the church intervenes with aScarlet Letter-like papal inquest. But the movie's joyously ribald vitality is utterly irresistible, and the casting of McCormack with Jaqueline Bisset (as her mother and courtesan mentor) is a stroke of pure genius. Merchant-Ivory would've made a smarter film from this material, but it probably wouldn't be nearly as entertaining.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["630437240X", "6303396623", "6301670140"]}, "price": 21.95, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 267533}, "asin": "0790736365", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZCPY3GV2L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Dangerous Beauty [VHS]"}

{"description": "The Band Wagon(1953) marked the culmination of a series of near-autobiographical pictures Fred Astaire made for MGM following his return from premature retirement in the late '40s. Astaire plays Tony Hunter, a fading film star (his big hit:Flying Down to Panama) who decides to return to his former glory, the Broadway stage. (In 1931, Astaire had starred on Broadway with sister Adele inThe Band Wagon, a revue that lent some of its songs to this film.) His playwright-songwriter friends (Nanette Fabray and Oscar Levant) hook him up with Broadway's hottest director, Jeffrey Cordova (a nicely hammy Jack Buchanan), who proves that the \"new\" theater traditions can be an awkward fit with the old. Hunter also finds himself at odds with his prima ballerina leading lady (Cyd Charisse), one of his chief worries being that she seems a little tall. Along the way, producer Arthur Freed, director Vincente Minnelli, choreographer Michael Kidd, and songwriters Howard Dietz and Arthur Schwartz treat us to some quintessential MGM numbers: Astaire's solo ode \"By Myself,\" the flashy arcade romp \"A Shine on Your Shoes,\" Astaire and Charisse's romantic duet \"Dancing in the Dark,\" the faux-German drinking song \"I Love Louisa,\" the manic trio \"Triplets\" (with Astaire, Fabray, and Buchanan in matching baby outfits), the Mickey Spillane-esque \"Girl Hunt Ballet,\" and the classic show-biz anthem \"That's Entertainment.\" Even if its ending and obligatory romance fall a little flat,The Band Wagonis one of the classic backstage musicals, a grandiose MGM spectacle that also manages to poke some fun at how grandiose MGM pictures had become.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301977343", "6301327853", "0792837533", "0780630157", "6302363276", "6304151306", "6305282927", "0792837630", "6303494390", "6302363292", "0783221347", "B0009J2F1E", "6301587375", "0792840836", "0792840844", "B00005LMA7", "6300183513", "B000BWIZRW", "B00000F3QZ", "6301969014", "0790743213", "6304039530", "6300215512", "6301967739"], "bought_together": ["6301977343"]}, "price": 5.95, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 386533}, "asin": "0790749467", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RDT0WX82L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Band Wagon [VHS]"}

{"description": "Otto Preminger's sprawling World War II drama packs a lot into its 165 minutes, beginning with the attack on Pearl Harbor (which Preminger re-creates in amazing detail) and ending a couple of years later with America's return to the South Pacific in force.

Minutes into WWII, they are already scapegoated and demoted by the embarrassed military brass. Wayne romances a WAVE nurse (Patricia Neal) and attempts a reconciliation with his estranged, spoiled son (Brandon de Wilde) while Douglas sinks into the bottle after the death of his cheating wife until the American fleet rebuilds and calls upon Wayne to lead one of the initial invasion forces. Henry Fonda makes a brief but commanding appearance as the fleet admiral. Burgess Meredith is a former writer turned witty commander, Dana Andrews a showy but indecisive admiral, and Stanley Holloway a genial Australian scout working with the American invasion forces. Tom Tryon and Paula Prentiss play newlyweds torn apart by the war, and also appearing are Franchot Tone, Carroll O'Conner, Slim Pickens, George Kennedy, Bruce Cabot, and Larry Hagman, among many, many more. Loyal Griggs's handsome black-and-white photography is topped only by Saul Bass's impressive closing credits sequence, a rising cascade of crashing waves and rough surf reportedly paced to mirror the dramatic rhythm of the film.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300181472", "6300988473", "6300215733", "0792106989", "6301802330", "6300208281", "B001E419N8", "6300267938", "6303057225", "6301798090", "630197705X", "0783216084", "6301325508", "6302320496", "6301736362", "B00004RFFA", "6301718275", "6301797922", "0792110188", "6303192254", "0792108868", "6300267830", "0792839846", "6304457316", "0782008348", "6304457278", "6302923042", "6304457308", "6300268748", "B000051S3Z", "6300268799", "6303599052", "B00005Q4GZ", "0792838556", "630150528X", "B000M7BEPQ", "6301662962", "6303597874", "6300183513", "0792107683", "6300184951", "6302224462", "6300246965"], "bought_together": ["6300181472"], "also_viewed": ["6303057225", "6302365945", "6303599052", "6303231799", "6301976924"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 210560}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 19.95, "brand": "", "asin": "0792102320", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51NK7XC5KEL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "In Harm's Way [VHS]"}
{"description": "Mel Gibson's Oscar-winning 1995Braveheartis an impassioned epic about William Wallace, the 13th-century Scottish leader of a popular revolt against England's tyrannical Edward I (Patrick McGoohan). Gibson cannily plays Wallace as a man trying to stay out of history's way until events force his hand, an attribute that instantly resonates with several of the actor's best-known roles, especiallyMad Max. The subsequent camaraderie and courage Wallace shares in the field with fellow warriors is pure enough and inspiring enough to bring envy to a viewer, and even as things go wrong for Wallace in the second half, the film does not easily cave in to a somber tone. One of the most impressive elements is the originality with which Gibson films battle scenes, featuring hundreds of extras wielding medieval weapons. After Eisenstein'sAlexander Nevsky, Orson Welles'sChimes at Midnight, and even Kenneth Branagh'sHenry V, you might think there is little new that could be done in creating scenes of ancient combat; yet Gibson does it.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00004XPQ6", "B00003CXE6", "6303953425", "6304935811", "B0001VL30O", "B000054OW2", "6302415853", "0790741512", "6304071876", "6301792734", "6303168507", "6303942830", "0800125762", "6300183211", "B000007OY0", "B000056BRF", "6300214540", "B000065U6Q", "B00004WIDB", "B00003CXTF", "B00007KK15", "079070546X", "B0000A36J1", "B00000K3AN", "6302482712", "6300263673", "6305169187", "0788811355", "B00003BE3X", "0800116917", "6304414099", "6303020089", "0792133153", "0790744589", "6302909023", "0800132009", "079212569X", "6300185095", "6303313345", "0767819462", "6304259131", "B00000K2SC", "0800199421", "B0001DI5W6", "B00005JLTM", "630018224X", "0790701251", "6304151306", "6303696813", "0790731274", "0792147618", "B00005RIJ3", "6301586026", "6302945089", "0783223218", "6305718792"], "bought_together": ["B00004XPQ6", "B00003CXE6"], "also_viewed": ["0792151712", "6303314015", "6301966988", "6303402348", "B00004WIDB", "0792116887", "6300213668", "0800125762", "B00004XPQ6", "0792842111", "B00003CXTF", "0788812408", "6302526574", "6303215734", "0788806270", "6300183211", "B00004U8P4", "0788802194"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 521725}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 0.5, "brand": "", "asin": "0792139771", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51PF2QYK62L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Braveheart (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]"}

But in life she can't seem to find anyone to tie the knot with her. Robert (Everett), her best friend and confidant, runs a successful landscaping business but is having equally dismal luck finding his Mr. Right. When Abbie's latest relationship crumbles, she turns to Robert (who happens to be gay) for comfort and advice. They commiserate over a parade of margaritas and martinis, which results in an unexpected tryst. Abbie becomes pregnant and believing, that this may be her one shot at motherhood, decides to have the child. Robert, committed to being a good father, moves in with her, and together they create an unconventional but loving home for their precocious son, Sam (Stumpf). Robert continues to date but keeps parenting as his first priority. Abbie, on the other hand, uses her yoga skills to remain celibate but finally relents when she meets Ben (Bratt), a handsome and charming investment banker. Romance flowers between Abbie and Ben, and as they grow closer Robert feels his role as father threatened. Tensions mount, and when Abbie and Ben announce plans to be wed, the family explodes over a heart-wrenching custody battle for Sam. Everett sparkles and Madonna oozes her usual cool in this drama/comedy from the director of MIDNIGHT COWBOY.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000BYA4JM", "B00007L4OE", "B0009JMKIW", "B00006L92K", "0792845773", "B0075564A8", "B0002UGVHO", "6305327041", "B002JM1VJG", "6305610444", "B00009NHAJ", "B0001IN0QW", "0800177258", "6304498977", "B000KGGLCU", "B00005T7I1", "B00606P044", "6304806418", "B00008S2VG", "B00DQVSTCG", "B00005JG6N", "B00005AUJO", "B002ZFQD04", "B00005QX8H", "B00D2UMHGA", "B0000DZ6N3", "B00443FMZM", "B001EDVNNU", "B00008G7UH", "B00FEXL3OA", "B00004GOVT", "B0059XTV4Y", "B008NNY8SQ", "B002GNOSFM", "B00756GKBA", "B0074JOU8I", "B007L6VMDK", "B00004XPPD", "B005LAIIB2", "B00AZ8RA3M", "B008BJU1XI", "B005UQQR06", "B00DQVST76", "B000002MUW", "0792843983", "0792833198", "B000002N3J", "B00004Y32O", "B00C5SE8F8", "B009IQG5LK", "B0045HCJGW", "B000B8QEZG", "B000002NJS", "B000FA57RG", "B000069HYG", "B0009RCPUW", "B001WAKFP2", "B00019GHQQ", "B00081U7HC", "B000UOGHKS", "B001P42YA4", "B0015D3Z4O", "B00000F0AD", "B0009HKH6Q", "B000Y11B7Q", "B00066FAC6", "B00005JN3W", "6305622914", "B007W2MKFM", "6305428271", "B006GGREO2", "B00CY5Y398", "6305718954", "B005C6BGVY", "0783114907", "0767821769", "B0002MHDW4", "B0006GANPA", "B00006ZXSL", "B0001Z37HM", "B004SIP9VA", "6306012419", "B0007XBM02", "B00AEBB9SM", "B000N0W9WO", "B00003CXFV", "B00AEFY5TI", "B008OHV68Q", "6305133468", "B00386EZKE", "B00049QQHI", "B00DW5IL92", "6304907729", "B000BQ5JAE", "B00AEFXZ1C", "B00070HK24", "B00026ZG10", "B007XTDWKQ", "6305428506"], "bought_together": ["B00007L4OE", "B000BYA4JM"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000BYA4JM", "B0075564A8", "B00009NHAJ", "B00006L92K"]}, "price": 29.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 99911}, "asin": "0792166736", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5156TNTKG2L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Next Best Thing"}

{"description": "When it was released during Hollywood's golden year of 1939,The Wizard of Ozdidn't start out as the perennial classic it has since become. The film did respectable business, but it wasn't until its debut on television that this family favorite saw its popularity soar. And whileOz's TV broadcasts are now controlled by media mogul Ted Turner (who owns the rights), the advent of home video has made this lively musical a mainstay in the staple diet of great American films. Young Dorothy Gale (Judy Garland), her dog, Toto, and her three companions on the Yellow Brick Road to Oz--the Tin Man (Jack Haley), the Cowardly Lion (Bert Lahr), and the Scarecrow (Ray Bolger)--have become pop-culture icons and central figures in the legacy of fantasy for children. As the Wicked Witch who covets Dorothy's enchanted ruby slippers, Margaret Hamilton has had the singular honor of scaring the wits out of children for more than six decades. The film's still as fresh, frightening, and funny as it was when first released. It may take some liberal detours from the original story by L. Frank Baum, but it's loyal to the Baum legacy while charting its own course as a spectacular film. Shot in glorious Technicolor, befitting its dynamic production design (Munchkinland alone is a psychedelic explosion of color and d&eacute;cor),The Wizard of Ozmay not appeal to every taste as the years go by, but it's required viewing for kids of all ages.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B005F96UJ6", "B0000VCZKM", "B00E9ZATKI", "0792839749", "B0087F7VSY", "B0090XLDKY", "B002M2Z3BA", "076781326X", "B00C7JGDBW", "B000P0J09W", "B000URDCC6", "B002HK9IDQ", "B0000DZ3EN", "B000RPCK2E", "B000065V42", "B001JV5BF8", "B0000AM6IY", "B00335EQ0E", "B005NFJAZS", "B003VS0CX8", "B0000VCZKW", "0062278010", "B002NZK5SW", "B0010X744G", "B00CQRN3QI", "B0009XT8ME", "B000HT3PGU", "B006VJ1AAI", "B00005RRG7", "B008H6GHEM", "B00GVFJ5QS", "B00HVBB140", "B002VWNIAY", "B000BT970O", "B002CLBJPK", "0060293233", "B00028HBES", "B00322XV8Q", "B00EV1YZ96", "B000AJJNIG", "B00AATV0WS", "B0054OGQM8", "1495421864", "0739060821", "B00AEFXMGU", "0792833759", "B00AMSQBNK", "B000TPTCP0", "B0009X75QU", "B00ITVMMOY", "B00005RRGB", "B0017Q0SJ4", "0767836324", "B004302N2Q", "084318017X", "B001GLX6UI", "B003YBW2Y4", "1402766254", "B00019GHU2", "B00003CXCQ", "B00AMSM9CW", "B00005JG6M", "B0047QLNUY", "B00GDT5T9Y", "B00447L4JG", "0767819659", "B00000JPH6", "B002BIGCXS", "B00G5G7EXY", "B0000AK7AB", "B006FE83UE", "B002VWNIBI", "B00005JL1P", "B001ILFUDC", "0800177258", "B000QQLVPQ", "B00005RDSQ", "B00JHH1ZN8", "B0006IINYQ", "B0015NORDW", "B002GHHHNS", "B0013ND30M", "0792838408", "B001AGXEAG", "B0047CG9F2", "B00006ADD5", "B0013FSL3E", "B00079Z9VO", "B00F6SHECS", "B0008JIJ2E", "B00CTNYLQA", "B00005JN4W"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00HVBB140", "B005F96UJ6", "B0000VCZKM", "B00I6JOD2S"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 206236}, "asin": "0792833171", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GYW80GAJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Wizard of Oz"}

{"description": "If you can stifle the urge to laugh at its pastel unisex costumes and futuristic shopping-mall d&eacute;cor, this extravagant science fiction film from 1976 is still visually fascinating and provocatively entertaining. Set in the year 2274, when ecological disaster has driven civilization to the protection of domed cities, the story revolves around a society that holds a ceremonial death ritual for all citizens who reach the age of 30. In a diseaseless city where free sex is encouraged and old age is virtually unknown, Logan (Michael York) is a \"sandman,\" one who enforces this radical method of population control (but he's about to turn 30 and he doesn't want to die). Escaping from the domed city via a network of underground passages, Logan is joined by another \"runner\" named Jessica (Jenny Agutter), while his former sandman partner (Richard Jordan) is determined to terminate Logan's rebellion. Using a variety of splendid matte paintings and miniatures,Logan's Runearned a special Oscar for visual effects (images of a long-abandoned Washington, D.C., are particularly impressive), and in addition to fine performances by Jordan and Peter Ustinov, the film features '70s poster babe Farrah Fawcett in a cheesy supporting role.

{"description": "Stanley Kubrick wrote the story and produced, edited, shot, and directed his second feature like a one-man studio, and his developing cinematic intelligence turns an otherwise unremarkable story into a memorable if slight film, a hint at masterpieces to come. Jamie Smith is a washed up prizefighter who rushes to the rescue of his platinum blonde dime-a-dancer neighbor (Irene Kane) when she's attacked by her dapper hoodlum boss (Frank Silvera). Smith and Kane fall in love, but their plans to  leave gritty New York for a simpler life in Seattle are jeopardized when jealous Silvera sends his thugs to lean on Smith. Mistaken identities and an overzealous beating lead to murder, kidnapping, and a desperate confrontation between Smith and Silvera in an eerie warehouse full of mannequins. Disembodied heads, swinging hands, and the blank stares of rows of lifeless dummies become a cold counterpoint to the sweaty, almost primal fight as Silvera wields an ax and Smith counters with a pike like gladiators in an abstract arena. The gray cityscape of New York (shot on location) turns into stark black and white and the city looms over the characters as the  tension tightens. Kubrick's sophisticated use of sound and austere visual style creates a hyper-realistic atmosphere, which he would put to even better use in his follow-up film, the heist classicThe Killing.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B005152C9G", "B007K8ILTW", "0792841409", "B007K8ILUQ", "B005152C78", "B000UJ48VI", "B000UJ48SQ", "B003WKL6YO", "0783226039", "B0039ZBM64", "B000UJCAKY", "B0057UA4CW", "B004O724M2", "B0013D8LKO", "B0057UA486", "B00ICWO1LC", "B001DJLCPE", "B00023P4GA", "B0013FSXT6", "B000B83846", "6305999872", "B00000K3D3", "B001FAZBLC", "B000055Y0X", "B000P0J09C", "3836527758", "B0000549B1", "B00AQ6J5YA", "B00012L786", "B00005Y70Q", "B000Q66J1M", "B0024FAG8A", "B000M2E3GI", "B004L9GMBC", "B00023P4II", "B0006Z2NDQ", "B00006RCNV", "1578062977", "B000WC39ZY", "B000B8384Q", "6305941122", "B00008978N", "B00023P4G0", "B000UJ48UO", "B00005ATQB", "B009X919UE", "B00004W229", "B000286RPM", "B00023P4FQ", "B000087F79", "0306809060", "B000Q678OO", "B00008RH3J", "B004PF0FJM", "B00003CXXP", "B002VWNIDG", "B000EXDSBQ", "B00000G02H", "B002QFYJF4", "B00AQ6J5JU", "B000CNE08I", "B0006Z2NE0", "B004C2523M", "B0024FAG80", "B000CNE088", "B005KQVE1S", "B00BGARG3C", "B00AEFXV3E", "B00B2BYXYA", "B00D6I7EGQ", "B003VMFWYI", "B001TIQT6G", "B004O724NG", "6305291470", "B000CNE08S", "B00004Y62V", "B00HZJH97Q", "B005SYZZ7Q", "B00D09AXUA", "B0087ZG7R0", "B004VA0R7Q", "B00007ELDG", "B0000CNY4M", "B000244EZ6", "B004CIIXG4", "B000PKG6OE", "B0050FXDDQ", "0253213908", "B008220DGE", "B00AEBB89C", "B002VKE1K2", "B000286RP2", "B000002LCG", "B0052SO06A", "B000FKO3VM", "B00092ZLEE", "B0089LT800", "B00CUKTGSA", "B00005AUK9", "B001P3SA8A"], "bought_together": ["B005152C9G", "B007K8ILTW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005152C9G", "0792841409", "B007K8ILTW", "B000UJ48SQ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 84060}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 15.88, "brand": "SILVERS,FRANK", "asin": "0792841387", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71TXWF8E3NL._SY300_.gif", "title": "Killer's Kiss"}

{"description": "This paranoia-fueled thriller, more intelligent and imaginative than you would have reason to believe, owes a huge debt toThe Stepford Wiveswith its premise of a goody-good high school clique programmed by an evil doctor to be wholesome, academically driven, and shining examples of clean living. Unlike its predecessor, though, David Nutter's film opts to open up its premise for everyone to see, diluting the scares but amplifying the creepy atmosphere. There's never any question of what's happening to the students of Cradle Bay High, who go from being druggies and sex fiends to the academically excellent Blue Ribbons, but it's a lot of fun to see these programmed teens run amok--and start killing people--when their hormones kick in. And considering they're all horny teenagers, this happens, oh, at least a few times a day. Model-perfect James Marsden, with stunning cheekbones and piercing blue eyes, is the new kid in town who stumbles on the plot with a little help from metalhead Nick Stahl. Moody Marsden stirs up trouble when he refuses to join up with the Blue Ribbons, prompting his concerned parents to consider signing him up for the program, especially after it turns Stahl into a vest-wearing, pep-rallying brainiac. The satire isn't entirely fulfilled (the evil kids hang out at the yogurt shop and spout inspirational platitudes), but once the action kicks in it's quite an enjoyable ride, thanks primarily to Bruce Greenwood (ofThe Sweet Hereafter) as the mad scientist behind it all and Katie Holmes (Go) as Marsden's love interest. Refusing the advances of the star football player and fighting gamely alongside Marsden, Holmes manages to deck a few bad guys with a fervor that squarely puts her in Linda Hamilton and Jamie Lee Curtis territory.

The film earned $23 million  theatrically and ushered in a spate of cheap animated films created to sell  merchandise to children. The plot interweaves the stories of Kim and Jason, two  lonely orphans who have given up caring, and of Nicholas, a friendless  magician's assistant who's seduced by an evil spirit. The Care Bears resolve  everyone's problems. Years later, the Care Bears' popularity has waned and the  film stands as a reminder of one of the less admirable uses of animation.

{"description": "Winner of five Academy Awards including Best Picture, Actor, and Screenplay,Kramer vs. Kramerremains as powerfully moving today as it was when released in 1979, simply because its drama will remain relevant for couples of any generation. Adapted by director Robert Benton from the novel by Avery Corman, this is perhaps the finest, most evenly balanced film ever made about the failure of marriage and the tumultuous shift of parental roles. It begins when Joanna Kramer (Meryl Streep) bluntly informs her husband Ted (Dustin Hoffman) that she's leaving him, just as his advertising career is advancing and demanding most of his waking hours. Self-involvement is just one of the film's underlying themes, along with the search for identity that prompts Joanna to leave Ted with their first-grade son (Justin Henry), who now finds himself living with a workaholic parent he barely knows. Juggling his domestic challenge with professional deadlines, Ted is further pressured when his wife files for custody of their son. This legal battle forms the dramatic spine of the film, but its power is derived from Benton's flawlessly observant script and the superlative performances of his entire cast. Because Benton refuses to assign blame and deals fairly with both sides of a devastating dilemma, the film arrives at equal levels of pain, growth, and integrity under emotionally stressful circumstances. That gives virtually every scene the unmistakable ring of truth--a quality of dramatic honestly that makesKramer vs. Kramernot merely a classic tearjerker, but one of the finest American dramas of its decade.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["630273973X", "0783240171", "B00005NQGQ", "B00AEBB95K", "6301627091", "6300182304", "0792835018", "B004IFIMT4", "6301247485", "6304935811"], "bought_together": ["630273973X"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 256640}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.95, "brand": "", "asin": "0800106032", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51J3PVCJM3L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Kramer vs. Kramer [VHS]"}

Some (as with Rob Lowe's seemingly doomstruck character) are more absurd than others. But absurdity isn't the issue in this movie; a general sense of indulgence is.

Director Rob Reiner poses important questions about the rights of the powerful and the responsibilities of those just following orders in this classic courtroom drama.", "related": {"also_bought": ["6304259131", "B000007OY0", "6302935148", "0792116887", "B00004WIDB", "6302816629", "6300214222", "6300214567", "6303269834", "6302989787", "0790748169", "0792133153", "B00000K3AN", "6304618344", "080018789X", "6303257844", "0783222955", "6302820448", "6300214540", "6301247485", "6302415853", "6303402348", "630179513X", "6301666569", "6303168507", "6300214826", "6305718792", "B00003CXE6", "6303212379", "B00003JRAB", "079213690X", "B001TODCII", "6301578805", "6304458975", "0800142039", "6300183211", "6300267970", "B00003G1FZ", "630419949X", "6300263673", "6300269043", "B0002GTWOM", "B00329TVQA", "6303908306", "6303020089", "0800132009", "0792841778", "B00008KDHM", "0790751089", "B000006N70", "6301627768", "B00000IO4G", "079212569X", "0783202253", "6303696813", "B00003CXFU", "6304258984", "6302881005", "0800179552", "0792147618", "0783223218", "6304935811", "6303313345", "0800199421", "B0001E7LQG", "6302909023", "0790735423", "0783204914", "630407185X", "0800125789", "6305622825", "0790731274", "6301976061", "6302945089", "6301976983", "6304155972", "0790701251", "0800116917", "6302779278", "0790734516", "6302822688", "0790705141", "0790731975"], "bought_together": ["6304259131", "6302935148"], "also_viewed": ["6304233639", "6300213668", "6305750750", "080010367X", "0792116887", "B000062XM6", "6302935148", "079213690X", "6302415853", "6303824382", "6303402348", "B000005QWI", "B001680M26", "6305169187", "630382790X", "0783225733", "080018789X"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 84448}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 0.99, "brand": "", "asin": "0800125762", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41S81CR5D4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "A Few Good Men [VHS]"}
{"description": "This wrong-headed adaptation of the very funny (and scatological)novelby T. Coraghessan Boyle was written and directed by Alan Parker, who doesn't seem to have much of a clue. It's not a botch, just a movie that hammers its efforts at humor too hard. The focus is split between three story lines: the life of cereal tycoon John Kellogg (Anthony Hopkins with buck teeth), who has created a health spa for the wealthy that focuses on regular cleansing of the digestive tract (as well as applications of electricity); the troubles of an unhappy young couple (Matthew Broderick and Bridget Fonda), who come to the spa hoping to cure their marital ills (Broderick gets the worst of the deal); and the efforts of a young hustler (John Cusack), who is trying to break into the breakfast-cereal business but gets taken by an even bigger hustler (Michael Lerner). There are subplots about Kellogg's children but they add little. For all the doo-doo and enema jokes, the joys of this movie are distinctly scattered.--Marshall Fine", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 49014}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "title": "Road to Wellville [VHS]", "related": {"also_bought": ["0140167188", "B000BF0CPW", "0800185676"], "also_viewed": ["0140167188"]}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51TDAVEBNQL._SY300_.jpg", "asin": "0800139062"}

This lighter-than-air comedy puts playboy writer Cary Grant in company with  17-year-old schoolgirl Shirley Temple, although he's more interested in older  sister Myrna Loy. (She's as sober as a judge, and indeed is one.) The Oscar&#xAE;- winning script by future bestselling novelist Sidney Sheldon boasts fun '40s  slang, but the main draw is Grant's willingness to play the fool. His gift for  slapstick shines when his aging bachelor decides to act like an inane teenager  in an effort to burst Shirley's fanciful image of him. As usual, Grant seems to  conspire with the audience (watch his double takes in the background) in making  a somewhat standard movie into a giddy experience. Toss in deadpan Rudy Vallee  as a sappy third wheel, and you've got a near-classic.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000BGH2HW", "6304153104", "6303364748", "B00AEFY8ZE", "B00133QNUO", "6301325508", "630336473X", "6303364780", "630309502X", "630336005X", "B002YAO1A4", "B00AATV046", "B00005UM6Q", "B0000040EO", "6301449142", "B000EO7AIC", "6304153066", "6302213266", "6304383169", "6303257801", "0780614097", "B00003OSTO", "6303317332", "6301661850", "6300207919", "0792839846", "B003MG6FJY", "6302765358", "6301967275", "B00000JKNL", "6301278410", "6302227127", "0800113055"], "bought_together": ["B000BGH2HW"], "also_viewed": ["B008D1Q1VU", "B000A8AX6I"]}, "price": 12.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 351559}, "asin": "1559600136", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51PJEYZM9ZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Bachelor and the Bobby-Soxer [VHS]"}
{"description": "Costa-Gavras'sZ, winner of the 1970 Academy Award for Best Foreign Film, is a classic political thriller, combining intrigue with raw emotional power. The story turns on the investigation of the assassination of a left-wing Greek politician (Yves Montand), and his government's attempts to cover up the murky circumstances. Montand receives death threats as he prepares to give a speech condemning the government, and is then run down in front of numerous witnesses. Jean-Louis Trintignant (The Conformist) plays the judge assigned to the investigation, who gradually discovers how far the state will go to rid itself of political opposition. As he is warned off the case by his superiors, the judge becomes even more determined to discover the truth, no matter where it might lead. Costa-Gavras (Missing,Mad City) is in familiar territory here, but no one handles this type of material better.Zis a classic of political intrigue and social consciousness.--Robert Lane", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 399575}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.76, "brand": "", "asin": "1572521163", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51R1GYXF6FL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Z [VHS]"}
{"description": "Simultaneously elegiac and raw, this uneven--but unforgettable--tearjerker tells the story of Ingemar, a 12-year-old working-class Swedish boy sent to live with his childless aunt and uncle in a country village when his mother falls ill.  Beginning with several representations of the most savage, unsentimental domestic intensity imaginable (interplay between a sick parent and loving child has never looked anywhere near as explosive),My Life as a Dogwisely doesn't attempt to maintain that level of danger; rather, the change in locale to rural Sweden is accompanied by a slackening of pace and a whimsical breeziness.  Nevertheless, the tragic condition of Ingemar's mother (and later, the indeterminate fate of Sickan, his beloved dog, consigned to a kennel) hovers over the narrative with a gripping portentousness.  At times, director Lasse Hallstr&ouml;m misplaces the rhythm, and the film threatens to degenerate into a series of rustic vignettes; luckily, Ingemar's relationship with Gunnar, the jocular yet somewhat sinister uncle who essentially adopts him, carries a fascinating charge.  In Swedish, with subtitles.  This was later rewritten, whether intentionally or not, by Spike Lee, who changed the gender of the child, set the story in New York City, added a 1970s soul soundtrack, and called itCrooklyn.--Miles Bethany", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 548529}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 20.0, "brand": "", "asin": "1572523581", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515G8EVDVJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "My Life as a Dog [VHS]"}

{"description": "Besides being a terrific movie in its own right--and the second entry in a remarkable eight-film series teaming director Anthony Mann and star James Stewart--Bend of the Riveris also fascinating as a variation on one of the greatest Westerns. With or without anyone else's knowledge, screenwriter Borden Chase reworked scenes, character configurations, and much of the structure ofRed River, the screenplay of which he had cowritten (from his own novel) for director Howard Hawks six years earlier. Seeing what Hawks and Mann did with some of the same scenes--a spooky night skirmish with Indians, for instance--makes for a compelling lesson in the transformative power of directorial style.Instead of Texas and the Chisholm Trail,Bend of the Riveris set in the Oregon river country, with a wagon train substituting for an epic cattle drive. Wagonmaster Stewart, a man with a secret past he's determined to redeem, rescues another, not-so-ex-renegade (Arthur Kennedy) from a lynching. Stewart finds Kennedy a powerful ally in a fight but ultimately has to face him as a mortal enemy--and to revert to his old savage ways in order to save his adopted community. Along the trail, they are variously companioned and/or menaced by the likes of slick gambler Rock Hudson (compare the Cherry Valance part inRed River) and hard cases Harry (then Henry) Morgan, Royal Dano, and Jack Lambert. There's knockout scenery, as usual with Mann, and fight-to-the-death action as bracing as a plunge into an icy river.--Richard T.

{"description": "The peril facing a lone American amid Third World political turmoil is elegantly communicated in this important film from Costa-Gavras (Z), adapted by the director and Donald Stewart from Thomas Hauser's nonfiction book. The key to its power onscreen stems from the decision not to center the action merely on the disappearance of Charles Horman (John Shea), but also on the search for him by his father Ed (Jack Lemmon)--and on Ed's discovery of a son he never knew. The Oscar-winning script flows freely between that search and Charles's earlier experiences in the unnamed country (in the true account, Chile). Providing a link between those two stories is Charles's wife Beth (Sissy Spacek), who follows her father-in-law around a country in chaos, teeming with reckless authority and disinterested American diplomats (epitomized by ace character actor David Clennon). The film, which was nominated for a Best Picture Oscar and won the Cannes Film Festival's top prize, is certainly manipulative, but it works because of its finely detailed human elements. Usually emotionally extroverted, Lemmon gives one of his finest performances playing against that type--here, he's a controlled, intellectual man who learns more about his son, and his country, than he ever dreamed he would.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["630368680X"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 473764}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 24.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6300182738", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41FTK884GEL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Missing [VHS]"}

{"description": "This 1985 adventure directed by Barry Levinson (Rain Man) and written  by Chris Columbus (Gremlins) may not have much to do with the Sherlock  Holmes of Arthur Conan Doyle's invention. But it is a delightful and somewhat  unexpected combination of exciting elements: Victorian-era, foggy-London  mystique, Gothic horror, and Indiana Jones-like exotica. Nicholas Rowe plays  Holmes as a schoolboy at a boarding academy for young men. Paired with the  owlish, reticent young Watson (Alan Cox), Holmes embarks on the solution of a  mystery that involves a hallucinatory and lethal drug, and a religious cult celebrating ancient Egyptian rites of mummification. Levinson makes handsome  and crisp work of this Steven Spielberg production, without a trace of the  treacle that often found its way into other Spielbergian projects at the time  (The Goonies).

{"description": "When Samuel (Lukas Haas), a young Amish boy traveling with his mother Rachel (Kelly McGillis), witnesses the murder of a police officer in a public restroom, he and his mother become the temporary wards of John Book (Harrison Ford), a detective who's been assigned to solve the crime. After suspect lineups and mug-shot books yield nothing, Samuel, in the most memorable scene of the film, recognizes the murderer as a narcotics agent whose picture he sees in the precinct. Once Book realizes that the police chief is in on it, too, he whisks Samuel and Rachel back home to Amish country, where he himself goes into hiding as a plain Amish man. The juxtaposition between the life of the Amish and the violence of inner-city police corruption work surprisingly well for the story, and Kelly McGillis as the falling in love widow gives an almost perfect performance. Directed by Peter Weir, the film is extremely successful in drawing the viewer into its world and, accordingly, is immensely entertaining. The only thing that mars its polish is the one-dimensional, almost cartoonish handling of the upper-echelon police corruption--a subtler, more realistic treatment of this aspect of the story would have rendered the film near perfect.--James McGrath", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792116887", "B000007OY0", "6304259131", "0800125762", "6302816629", "6302238331", "6302935148", "0792133153", "6303269834", "B00000JS61", "080018789X", "630442972X", "B000003KDG", "0790743213", "6302415853", "6304071876", "079284517X", "B00005PJ8I", "6303402348", "0790748169", "6303057225", "6303637574", "6301599896", "6303942830", "B0000068ZQ", "6303020089", "6300181340", "0783235607", "6303402070", "B00007E2F6", "0790734079", "6300182479", "B00000J2L7", "6301734734", "079212569X", "6301736362", "6302909023", "0800116917", "6305126062", "6302226899", "6303696813", "6300247112", "0783226152", "B00000F5PI", "6305426678", "B000006N70", "0800132009", "6303058981", "6305012792", "B003MG6FJY", "6301976924", "5559477621", "B00005A1VH", "0783231482", "6303451462", "B000063UUP", "0792107683", "0800123506", "6304458975", "6303109950", "0790733935", "6304214502", "0792838556"], "bought_together": ["0792116887", "6302816629"], "also_viewed": ["6302380588"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 257292}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6300214567", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41JAT9P45FL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Witness [VHS]"}

{"description": "Back when the  firstStar Trekfeature was released in December 1979, theTrekfranchise was still relatively modest, consisting of the original TV series, an animated cartoon series from 1973-74, and a burgeoning fan network around the world. Series creator Gene Roddenberry had conceived a second TV series, but after the success ofStar Warsthe project was upgraded into this lavish feature film, which reunited the original series cast aboard a beautifully redesigned starship U.S.S.Enterprise. Under the direction of Robert Wise (best known forWest Side Story), the film proved to be a mixed blessing forTrekfans, who heatedly debated its merits; but it was, of course, a phenomenal hit. Capt. Kirk (William Shatner) leads his crew into the vast structures surrounding V'Ger, an all-powerful being that is cutting a destructive course through Starfleet space. With his new First Officer (Stephen Collins), the bald and beautiful Lieutenant Ilia (played by the late Persis Khambatta) and his returning veteran crew, Kirk must decipher the secret of V'Ger's true purpose and restore the safety of the galaxy. The story is rather overblown and derivative of plots from the original series, and avid Trekkies greeted the film's bland costumes with derisive laughter. But as a feast for the eyes, this is an adventure worthy of big-screen trekkin'. Douglas Trumbull's visual effects are astonishing, and Jerry Goldmith's score is regarded as one of the prolific composer's very best (with its main theme later used forStar Trek: The Next Generation). And, fortunately forStar Trekfans, the expanded 143-minute version (originally shown for the film's network TV premiere) is generally considered an improvement over the original theatrical release.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300214400", "6300213803", "6301543408", "6303202004", "630021463X", "6303909949", "B0000AUHOH", "B00008OSD3", "6301792734", "6305587159", "6300182304", "B0000A36J1", "B000065U6Q", "6304415346", "6305365121", "630336568X", "0671830880", "6300214060", "6304935811", "6302380588", "6303651488"], "bought_together": ["6300213803", "6300214400"], "also_viewed": ["6300213803", "6301543408", "B00DB97LRC", "6300214400", "630021463X", "B00BAXTYIA", "B00005JLRT", "6303202004", "B00DB97LCM", "B00000ILBK", "B002I9Z8DK", "B0000AUHOH", "B002I9Z8B2", "6304415346", "6304539258", "B000USUA8Y", "B002I9Z8CG", "B0095XPZBC", "B002I9Z8GW", "B001TH16DI", "B0083TUEHY", "B00HETWFVC", "630273486X", "B000HEWEJ4", "6303909949", "6300213668"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 278050}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.79, "brand": "", "asin": "6300216802", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4164CYFHC6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Star Trek - The Motion Picture [VHS]"}
{"description": "Black comedies don't come much blacker than this cult favorite from 1972, and they don't come much funnier, either. It seemed that director Hal Ashby was the perfect choice to mine a mother lode of eccentricity from the original script by Colin Higgins, about the unlikely romance between a death-obsessed 19-year-old named Harold (Bud Cort) and a life-loving 79-year-old widow named Maude (Ruth Gordon). They meet at a funeral, and Maude finds something oddly appealing about Harold, urging him to \"reach out\" and grab life by the lapels as opposed to dwelling morbidly on mortality. Harold grows fond of the old gal--she's a lot more fun than the girls his mother desperately matches him up with--and together they makeHarold & Maudeone of the sweetest and most unconventional love stories ever made. Much of the earlier humor arises from Harold's outrageous suicide fantasies, played out as a kind of twisted parlor game to mortify his mother, who's grown immune to her strange son's antics. Gradually, however, the film's clever humor shifts to a brighter outlook and finally arrives at a point where Harold is truly happy to be alive. Featuring soundtrack songs by Cat Stevens, this comedy certainly won't appeal to all tastes (it was a box-office flop when first released), but if you're on its quirky wavelength, it might just strike you as one of the funniest movies you've ever seen.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301590740", "B00000FZCU"], "bought_together": ["6301590740"], "also_viewed": ["6300247171"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 239875}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6300216268", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5184NCC63XL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Harold &amp; Maude [VHS]"}
{"description": "In retrospect, George Seaton's adaptation ofThe Country Girlseems like the movie that was made to prove that both Bing Crosby and Grace Kelly couldact. The tale of an alcoholic actor and singer (Crosby) and his long-suffering wife (Kelly) whose marriage is put to the test when he gets a second chance at stardom, Clifford Odets' drama is chock full of twists and turns designed to give actors a grueling workout, with its hidden secrets, tortured love story, and frank depiction of the horrors of alcohol abuse. Crosby and Kelly sank their teeth into the meaty roles with gusto (it helped that a rock-solid William Holden was there for each to spark off of), and both were showered with accolades that remained high points of their careers. Crosby was lauded with kudos for turning his charming persona inside-out, but it was Kelly who stole the show, possibly because at the time she was one of the hardest working women in show business. In 1954, the actress appeared in four films, including the Alfred Hitchcock classicsDial M for MurderandRear Window, and finally ascended to leading-lady status after her stellar supporting turns inHigh NoonandMogambo. In typical Hollywood fashion, though, it was only when Kelly shrouded her breathtaking beauty in plain clothes and a dowdy hairdo that she was taken seriously and awarded a Best Actress Oscar--one of the most highly contested ever, as she beat out comeback star Judy Garland's ferocious performance inA Star Is Born.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792837649", "B000003KE0", "0792839846", "6300215695", "6300215741", "0782008348", "0792110269", "6301586026"], "bought_together": ["0792837649"], "also_viewed": ["630197879X"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 408172}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.75, "brand": "", "asin": "6300215660", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4120G3A9TKL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Country Girl [VHS]"}

{"description": "When it comes down to naming the best Western of all time, the list usually narrows to three completely different pictures: John Ford'sThe Searchers, Howard Hawks'sRed River, and Hawks'sRio Bravo. About the only thing they all have in common is that they all star John Wayne. But whileThe Searchersis an epic quest for revenge andRed Riveris a sweeping cattle-drive drama (\"Take 'em to Missouri! Yeeee-hah!\"),Rio Bravois on a much more modest scale. Basically, it comes down to Sheriff John T. Chance (Wayne), his sobering-up alcoholic friend Dude (Dean Martin), the hotshot new kid Colorado (Ricky Nelson), and deputy-sidekick Stumpy (Walter Brennan), sittin' around in the town jail, drinkin' black cofee, shootin' the breeze, and occasionally, singin' a song. Hawks--who, like his pal Ernest Hemingway, lived by the code of \"grace under pressure\"--said he madeRio Bravoas a rebuke toHigh Noon, in which sheriff Gary Cooper begged for townspeople to help him. So, Hawks made Wayne's Sheriff Chance a consummate professional--he may be getting old and fat, but he knows how to do his job, and he doesn't want amateurs getting mixed up in his business; they could get hurt. This most entertaining of movies also achieved some notoriety in the '90s when Quentin Tarantino (director ofPulp Fiction,Reservoir Dogs, andJackie Brown) revealed that he uses it as a litmus test for prospective girlfriends. Oh, and if the configuration of characters sounds familiar, it should: Hawks remadeRio Bravotwo more times--asEl Doradoin 1967, with Wayne, Robert Mitchum, and James Caan; and asRio Loboin 1970, with Wayne, Jack Elam, and Christopher Mitchum.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792110188", "6301802330", "6300267938", "6304457308", "0792106989", "630197705X", "6300268799", "6300181588", "6301798090", "B000GX4476", "0792107128", "6304457316", "6304457278", "B000051S3Z", "6300183041", "0782008348", "0792105907", "6302320496", "6303471730", "B0018PH3L0", "B001E419N8", "B0000TANUI", "6301797922", "6301805518", "6300215733", "6300988473", "6301736362", "630150528X", "0790743213", "6303192254", "6300269884", "1555265952", "6301325508", "6300269043", "6303109950", "0792108868", "6304414099", "6304429711", "6302862906", "6303402070", "B00000I1DI", "6300216500", "0792838556", "6305237115", "B000GX7MMA", "6302990076", "B000056BRF", "630281622X", "6303101267", "0790727382", "6301976983", "6302032245", "6304286961", "6304071876"], "bought_together": ["0792110188", "6301802330"], "also_viewed": ["B000051S3Z"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 277544}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.89, "brand": "", "asin": "6300268470", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5127ECYB5EL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Rio Bravo [VHS]"}

The storytelling was never as lean as inDumbo, the songs rarely as haunting (or just plain weird), the characters rarely so well defined. The film pits the \"cold, cruel, heartless\" world that can't accept abnormality against a plucky, and mute, hero. Jumbo Jr. (Dumbo is a mean-spirited nickname) is ostracized from the circus pack shortly after his delivery by the stork because of his big ears. His mother sticks up for him and is shackled. He's jeered by children (an insightful scene has one boy poking fun at Dumbo's ears, even though the youngster's ears are also ungainly), used by the circus folk, and demoted to appearing with the clowns. Only the decent Timothy Q. Mouse looks out for the little guy. Concerns about the un-PC \"Jim Crow\" crows, who mock Dumbo with the wonderful \"When I See an Elephant Fly,\" should be moderated by remembering that the crows are the only social group in the film who act kindly to the little outcast. If you don't mist up during the \"Baby Mine\" scene, you may be legally pronounced dead.--Keith Simanton", "related": {"also_bought": ["0788806270", "6302642248", "155890641X", "0788812807", "6304500831", "0788812408", "0788802194", "078881172X", "6304401132", "6302320402", "6300274268", "6303314015", "6302526574", "6302961572", "6302787068", "6302178924", "6303983812", "6300275310", "6305319138", "B000035Z2S", "6304400551", "6305229449", "6303929338", "6302158095", "0788805843", "6304089767", "0788803743", "6304100507", "B00005JKDQ", "B0000AQZYM", "6302426200", "0788805533", "6303036813", "6304290888", "6301390725", "6305326940", "6304089201", "6300274608", "6304978286", "0788812440", "6301991311", "B0009SUS4Q", "B00004R99N", "6303122647", "B00000ICHA", "1558906150", "B00005JKX3", "6304400225", "6303534422", "B00016JF2W", "B00003CX7L", "B00003CXQX", "6302484359", "6304400381", "B00005RDVV", "6304401736", "B000009CTR", "B00005T7H6", "6304501153", "B000035Z4W", "6305940932", "6303991408", "B00005JL95", "B00003CXHR", "078880720X", "6300276554", "6303939015", "B00004R99I", "B0000E32WB", "B00000JS61", "B00003CWPW", "B0000524CZ", "6304155972", "6304492960", "B000035Z46", "6304873441", "B00000G3AV", "6302794331", "B000063V8N", "B00004R996", "6303295614", "B00008Y47S", "B00005RRG3", "6304492952", "B00004REYY", "B00003CXQ6", "6304293968", "0788810448", "0788811002", "6304117752", "6305942285", "6303232221", "6303861733", "0788810634", "6304089449", "B00000J2JA", "B00005RDWC", "B00000ICHI", "6304089112"], "bought_together": ["0788806270", "6302642248"], "also_viewed": ["6302642248", "0788806270", "155890641X", "078881172X", "0788812408", "0788802194", "6303314015", "6302961572", "6302787068", "6304500831", "6302320402", "6302526574", "6304401132", "6303983812", "6302178924", "0788812807", "6300274268", "6304290888", "6304089767", "6305229449", "B000035Z2S", "6303929338", "6304100507", "6304400551", "0788805843", "B0000AQZYM", "6302158095", "6305319138", "6300275310", "B00004R99N", "6305326940", "B00005JKDQ", "0788805533", "B00003CX7L", "6304501153", "B0007KTBIU", "6305940932", "6303534422", "6304978286", "B00004R99I", "6303036813", "6301991311", "0788812440", "6302426200", "6300274608", "6304400225", "B00005RDVV", "6301390725", "B00016JF2W", "B00003CXQX", "B0002YLCOM", "6304401736", "B00003CXHR", "0788811002", "6304873441", "6302484359", "6304400381", "B00005JL95", "B00005JKX3"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 117443}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.93, "brand": "", "asin": "6300274195", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51V3HBK8ACL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Dumbo [VHS]"}
{"description": "\"I'm not a drinker--I'm a drunk.\" These words, and the serious message behind them, were still potent enough in 1945 to shock audiences flocking toThe Lost Weekend. The speaker is Don Birnam (Ray Milland), a handsome, talented, articulate alcoholic. The writing team of producer Charles Brackett and director Billy Wilder pull no punches in their depiction of Birnam's massive weekend bender, a tailspin that finds him reeling from his favorite watering hole to Bellevue Hospital. Location shooting in New York helps the street-level atmosphere, especially a sequence in which Birnam, a budding writer, tries to hock his typewriter for booze money. He desperately staggers past shuttered storefronts--it's Yom Kippur, and the pawnshops are closed. Milland, previously known as a lightweight leading man (he'd starred in Wilder's hilariousThe Major and the Minorthree years earlier), burrows convincingly under the skin of the character, whether waxing poetic about the escape of drinking or screaming his lungs out in the D.T.'s sequence. Wilder, having just made the ultra-noirDouble Indemnity, brought a new kind of frankness and darkness to Hollywood's treatment of a social problem. At first the film may have seemed too bold; Paramount Pictures nearly killed the release of the picture after it tested poorly with preview audiences. But once in release,The Lost Weekendbecame a substantial hit, and won four Oscars: for picture, director, screenplay, and actor.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302413435", "6300269310", "B0045HCJ08", "0783217390", "6302801133", "6302226899", "1558807780", "0792839846", "6302730023"], "bought_together": ["6300269310"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 318451}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.51, "brand": "", "asin": "6301005740", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51BYDFD7C2L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Lost Weekend [VHS]"}

{"description": "Holy camp site, Batman! After a fabulously successful season on TV, the campy comic book adventure hit the big screen, complete with painful puns, outrageous supervillains, and fights punctuated with word balloons sporting such onomatopoeic syllables as \"Pow!,\" \"Thud!,\" and \"Blammo!\" Adam West's wooden Batman is the cowled vigilante alter ego of straight-arrow millionaire Bruce Wayne and Bruce Ward's Robin (a.k.a. Dick Grayson, Bruce's young collegiate prot&eacute;g&eacute;) his overeager sidekick in hot pants. Together they battle an unholy alliance of Gotham City's greatest criminals: the Joker (Cesar Romero, whooping up a storm), the Riddler (giggling Frank Gorshin), the Penguin (cackling Burgess Meredith), and the purr-fectly sexy Catwoman (Lee Meriwether slinking in a skin-tight black bodysuit). The criminals are, naturally, out to conquer the world, but with a little help from their unending supply of utility belt devices (bat shark repellent, anyone?), our dynamic duo thwarts their nefarious plans at every turn. Since the TV show ran under 30 minutes an episode (with commercials), the 105-minute film runs a little thin--a little camp goes a long way--but fans of the small-screen show will enjoy the spoofing tone throughout.

{"description": "Director Bob Clark's charming, touching, and very funny adaptation of humorist Jean Shepherd's nostalgic, autobiographical Yuletide novel,In God We Trust, All Others Pay Cash, remains essential holiday family viewing. Narrated by a man (Shepherd) recalling his childhood, the film looks back at the compulsive efforts of 7-year-old Ralphie (Peter Billingsley) as he tries every means possible to acquire his dream Christmas gift--a Daisy-brand Red Ryder repeating BB carbine with a compass mounted in the stock. Problem is, he lives in a Norman Rockwell-esque Midwestern town in the 1940s, where his parents, teachers, and even Santa Claus all warn Ralphie that \"he'll shoot his eye out.\" Episodic in nature and seen entirely through the eyes of a child, the film offers a wonderful look at the day-to-day eccentricities that grew out of this conservative period. More interestingly, it cleverly captures childhood urgency, where even the most trivial fantasies or objects become immediate life-or-death necessities. While countless family Christmas movies serve up clich&eacute;d situations suffocating with preachy sermons, Clark's acute eye for detail and odd mixture of warmth, satire, and quirky humor are the reasons why so many viewers have rediscovered this after it initially bombed in the theaters. Sentimental without being syrupy, it's a true rarity: a holiday movie that adults and children can enjoy equally, for completely different reasons and regardless of the season.--Dave McCoy", "related": {"also_bought": ["079070546X", "6301969707", "6303215734", "B00005LOUS", "6302091632", "B001E4TDR2", "B00000JS61", "5559477621", "6304209266", "B0002F6BQU", "6304117752", "6304400551", "6303442447", "6302526574", "6304089767", "6302794331", "6301390725", "6305123616", "0788812807", "6302765536", "6303314015", "B00005LL26", "0307142450", "6301404440", "6300215695", "6303122647", "B000YABV7W", "0793941520", "0783215517", "6302503795", "B00004UGAU", "B000003KLW", "0375810331", "B00004VVP8", "6301912810", "6301578805", "B00004RFHF", "6301300394", "6302090873", "B0000D14JV", "6300157601", "B00000JGEK", "B00008X5J8", "6301928458", "B00000JKNL", "6301627768", "0800139151", "B00001IVED", "B00001YX9H", "6304140738", "6301798503", "6303675212", "6300989003", "B00005A1VG", "6302581907", "0767825985", "6300216993", "6301670140", "6301977742"], "bought_together": ["079070546X"], "also_viewed": ["6301969707", "B00001IVED", "B00005LOUS", "6303215734", "B00006HBUC", "6304117752", "6302914469", "6304500831", "6303212379", "6304400225", "6300274268", "6302787068", "155890641X", "B00000JS61", "6302178924", "6304434340", "B00004VVP8", "6304089767", "6302642248", "B0007KTBIU", "B00005LL26", "0788812408", "6304400551", "B0000AQZYM", "6303314015", "6302961572", "B00005JKDQ", "6304718551", "B0002F6BQU", "0783231482", "0792839846", "B000028U3S", "B00006FDMY", "6303123244", "B00003CX7L", "6305123616", "B00003CX8I", "6302320402", "0790719029", "6300213668", "6304143184", "1560395966", "B00005O5ML", "6302503795", "B00000K4ZI", "0788805843", "0790742578", "6303212395", "1560395737", "6303338690", "6302091632", "6304290888", "0790700506", "0790742322", "B00000490M", "B00004TX1W", "6304539274", "B00004RFHF", "6304151306"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 318159}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6301966554", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/512TVV2E0DL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "A Christmas Story [VHS]"}

{"description": "Originally running an astonishing 10 hours when it was produced in 1925,Greedsuffered one of Hollywood's unkindest cuts. Much to the devastation of its Austrian creator, Eric von Stroheim, MGM slaughtered his ambitious silent epic based on Frank Norris' solemn novel,McTeague, reducing it from 42 reels to 10 with a running time of just over two hours (von Stroheim broke down upon watching the finished piece). Yet, it's a testament to the director's vision and talent that the surviving version ofGreedremains one of cinema's timeless masterpieces. Sure, its plot-examining the destructive effects that a large lottery payoff has on three close friends feels stilted and awkward at times. But there's enough brilliance to shield any minor quibbles. The restrained, subtle acting, the cynical attitude toward wealth and excess, and especially the bitter, claustrophobic portrayal of a selfish marriage between the Gibson Gowland and ZaSu Pitts characters all retain freshness and seem remarkably contemporary even now.Von Stroheim digs at his characters' weaknesses with ferocious irony, exposing recurring hypocrisy and ugliness whenever money enters the picture. Visually, the director understood the thematic importance of setting his characters against contrasting landscapes, andGreedwas among the first films shot almost entirely on location. As it moves from the buzzing, crowded streets of San Francisco to the haunting last images in the desolate wasteland of Death Valley--a place where money has no value--von Stroheim's ruthless satire demolishes everything American in its path.--Dave McCoy", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 185229}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "title": "Greed [VHS]", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00CL1SQHU", "0780022343", "6301976096", "B00D9BNOKK", "B0025X4PFQ", "B00005M1ZO"], "also_viewed": ["B000EVVCZC", "B0043H9W3W", "B003N2CVRC", "B00IGK6TGU", "B0040QYROA", "B00007CVS8", "B002AFX53C", "B004TJ1H2I", "B000GTJSE4", "B005152C7S", "6301965744", "B000094J73", "B00D9BNONW", "B00006JMQG", "B0006GANX2", "B001EZE5E2", "B00GG0NABE", "B005HK13OK", "B00CL1SQHU", "B00F8LQ64A", "B00027JYLC", "B00HZN8TBC"]}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/418KBP7RCEL._SY300_.jpg", "asin": "6301969146"}

{"description": "Louisa May Alcott's beloved story is one of the most-read novels ever written. It has also proved popular film and telefilm fodder (at least six versions plus a TV series). In addition,Little Womenis one of those rare literary projects that can truly be done well on screen. This, the 1933 version, chronicles the lives and loves of sisters Jo, Meg, Amy, and Beth (played, respectively, by Katharine Hepburn, Frances Dee, Joan Bennett, and Jean Parker). It's a superior rendering to the amiable, perky 1949 version with June Allyson, Janet Leigh, Elizabeth Taylor, Margaret O'Brien, and Peter Lawford, and comparable to the beautiful, feminist Gillian Armstrong 1994 take. Douglass Montgomery's Laurie isn't nearly as dreamy as Christian Bale's (1994), but the lack of chemistry between him and Hepburn's Jo is perfect for the story, in which Jo loves him like a brother. Jo's real love she offers up to perhaps the finest Professor Bhaer (Paul Lukas). Character actress Edna May Oliver is at her indignant best as Aunt March. Director George Cukor's vision is elegant, warm, and as true to the original source material as 117 minutes allows.

{"description": "Nominally a supernatural thriller, Peter Weir's third feature resonates with the director's underlying fascination with the collision between the modern, rational world and the primordial mysteries of older belief systems. InThe Last Wave, the keys to an enigmatic murder, as well as baffling disturbances in the weather, are gradually revealed to an Australian lawyer (Richard Chamberlain) within the shadowy, nomadic culture of aborigines living in and around Sydney who until now were presumed to be assimilated into its modern--and white--social fabric. In the process, Weir brings us toward an apocalyptic climax that is foreshadowed with a haunting series of events that cohere around water imagery, from an improbable drowning on dry land to downpours from cloudless skies, sudden hailstorms on the sere Australian land, and ghostly invasions of frogs.The film's power (as well as what skeptics might regard as its pretension) emanates from Weir's stately, deliberate pace.  Violating most of the conventions of suspense, he unravels his mystery with an unsettling calm underscored by its sparse soundtrack, which replaces conventional orchestral cues with the low, brooding rattle and hum of the didgeridoo. Instead of sudden camera movements or quick cuts, Weir circles his subjects almost diffidently.  The stillness of that approach only amplifies the mounting unease Chamberlain's character, David Burton, feels as he steps for the first time beyond the bland safety of his privileged life and into the mystical world of the native Australians. Taking on the defense of the aborigines suspected of murdering the drowned man through tribal magic, his own beliefs are tested by the suspects' evident, intuitive connections to nature.Chamberlain's Anglicized performance seems fussy and epicene, which only heightens the quiet intensity and watchful grace conveyed by the two aborigines, Chris Lee (David Gulpilil) and the shaman, Charlie (Nandjiwarra Amagula), who give Burton his first glimpse of their culture's \"dreamtime\" and the potent symbolism it contains.--Sam Sutherland", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300185826"]}, "price": 4.77, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 345531}, "asin": "630197249X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DY2JMZ6YL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Last Wave [VHS]"}

{"description": "The devil is in the details when it comes to this effervescent Fred Astaire and Rita Hayworth musical. The slight storyline is a hook upon which to hang dance sequences, bits of humor, and songs by Jerome Kern and Johnny Mercer. Set in Buenos Aires, it's a remake of an Argentine feature from the previous year and followedYou'll Never Get Rich. Astaire stars as a professional hoofer and Hayworth is Adolphe Menjou's second oldest daughter. The wealthy businessman won't let his youngest daughters marry until Maria (Hayworth) ties the knot. She couldn't care less--until a case of mistaken identity leads her to believe that Robert (Astaire) is in love with her (he's just looking for a job at her father's club). Highlights include a tap dance set to \"Shorty George\" and the Oscar&reg;-nominated \"Dearly Beloved,\" which is sung by both leads (with Hayworth dubbed by Nan Wynn).--Kathleen C.

{"description": "One of the top five screwball comedies of the '30s, this helped to cement a genre that waxed golden until the end of WWII. Director Leo McCarey won an Oscar for Best Director for this 1937 romantic comedy--one of the most successful films of his career. Irene Dunne and Cary Grant are a squabbling couple who separate because of supposed infidelities on both sides. They part but cannot really keep away from each other. Grant finds himself hooked up with a socialite, Dunne becomes engaged to a millionaire hick played by the hapless Ralph Bellamy (as if he ever stood a chance as the \"other\" man!). When not dating others or baiting one another in a verbal war, Grant and Dunne wage a custody battle over their pathetic pooch. Gags, double entendre, witty remarks, snide comments, and fast-paced dialogue helped this to garner six Academy Award nominations.The Awful Truthwas awfully good to Dunne and Grant, as both were breaking out of much more serious molds and this secured their positions.--Rochelle O'Gorman", "related": {"also_bought": ["6304525125", "630290899X", "6301964012", "6301278437", "B0000049FG", "630228175X", "630266232X", "B00156HZM4", "6301977688", "0782006795", "0792837096", "6303333079", "6302801133", "6300987523", "6303402070", "6300185206", "0800113055", "0780018664", "6301963911"], "bought_together": ["6304525125"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 346788}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6302305950", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51KT5XQB7KL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Awful Truth [VHS]"}

However, the Cheyenne are nobly  wooden (and played by non-Indians), and it's sympathetic cavalry officer Richard  Widmark and Quaker missionary Carroll Baker through whose eyes most of the epic  narrative unfolds.

Carroll Naish). It's really more like two films. Karloff and Naish escape prison and find the skeleton of Dracula, resurrecting the dapper vampire (played by a dignified John Carradine) and unleashing him on an unsuspecting town. In the second half, the not-so-good doctor investigates the ruins of Castle Frankenstein (left from the cataclysmic conclusion ofFrankenstein Meets the Wolfman) and finds the frozen bodies of the Wolf Man (Lon Chaney) and the Monster (Glenn Strange, picking up creature-feature tips from former flathead Karloff, no doubt). He proceeds to revive them, with the expected results: murder, mayhem, and a bad end for all. The screenplay has a slapdash quality about it, notably the Dracula sequences which dismiss Universal's most dignified monster with almost no fanfare, and Erle C. Kenton's direction only rises above perfunctory for the conclusion, a mad monster brawl with some arresting moments. But while it's hardly the best of the Universal horrors, the high monster quotient makes it a fun if undercooked entry in the genre.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302841771", "6300185443", "6302843219", "630284178X", "630252542X", "6302526175", "6302841763", "6300181278", "6300183084", "6301257014", "6301005783", "6300183629", "6300183092", "6302843227", "6302841844", "6302526094", "6300181286", "630018529X", "6302843197", "6302120101", "630252587X", "6302841798", "6300181820", "6303129153", "6301797906"], "bought_together": ["630284178X", "6300183092"], "also_viewed": ["B00005LC4K", "B00005LC4L", "B00000JMOF", "6300185443", "630284178X", "6302841771", "6301257014", "6302841763", "6300181278", "B0001CNRLQ", "6303129145", "B008FL8OTK", "6302843200", "6303626475"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 361264}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 15.75, "brand": "", "asin": "6302526167", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515KBHYXH1L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "House of Frankenstein [VHS]"}

The film's humor is derived from the efforts of these two hopelessly citified slickers to adapt themselves to the rigors of rural life.", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303103618", "6303103634", "6303410154", "6303103642", "6303346391", "6303410162", "6303346421", "6303410170", "6301976932", "6303103626", "0792840836", "6302227127", "6302477379", "B00000F6D1", "B00000JKNL", "6301736303", "6302120535", "6301980476", "6303854311", "6301325508", "6300267938", "630266232X", "0792838556"], "bought_together": ["6303410162"], "also_viewed": ["B005DDN51A", "6303410154", "6303103618"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 293962}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.0, "brand": "", "asin": "630310374X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41JJP5EB5QL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Egg and I (The Ma &amp; Pa Kettle Collection) [VHS]"}
{"description": "For those who never thought Disney would release a film in which Santa Claus is kidnapped and tortured, well, here it is!  The full title isTim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas, which should give you an idea of the tone of this stop-action animated musical/fantasy/horror/comedy.  It is based on characters created by Burton, the former Disney animator best known as the director ofPee-wee's Big Adventure,Beetlejuice,Edward Scissorhands, and the first twoBatmanmovies. His benignly scary-funny sensibility dominates the story of Halloweentown resident Jack Skellington (voice by Danny Elfman, who also wrote the songs), who stumbles on a bizarre and fascinating alternative universe called ... Christmastown!  Directed by Henry Selick (who later made the delightfulJames and the Giant Peach), this PG-rated picture has a reassuringly light touch.  As Roger Ebert noted in his review, &quot;some of the Halloween creatures might be a tad scary for smaller children, but this is the kind of movie older kids will eat up; it has the kind of offbeat, subversive energy that tells them wonderful things are likely to happen.&quot;--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["0788812408", "6302526574", "6300274268", "B000C3L27U", "6300274195", "155890641X", "0788812807", "6304290888", "6304401132", "B00005JKDQ", "6304500831", "0788802194", "6303314015", "6302787068", "6304089767", "6304155972", "B00003CX7L", "6302642248", "B00000ICHA", "6305229449", "0788803743", "6304978286", "6302320402", "6305326940", "6305319138", "B0000AQZYM", "0788806270", "6302178924", "B00005K9OA", "6302968143", "B000035Z2S", "6303983812", "6304400551", "6304501153", "6302961572", "6302794331", "B00005JL95", "B00003CWPW", "B00004R99N", "1558906150", "B00003CXQX", "0788805843", "B003UAKE9Y", "6305940932", "B000035Z46", "B00005JKX3", "0788805533", "6304100507", "6303232221", "6303018343", "078881172X", "6304492960", "6303534422", "6304492979", "B00000JS61", "6304492952", "6304293968", "6302426200", "B0000524CZ", "6300274608", "6301991311", "6302642493", "B00000J2JA", "B00007AJLB", "B00005LL26", "6301948106", "6301390725", "6304873441", "B00006953H", "6304089627", "0788812181", "B00005RDVV", "6300275310", "0788810448", "B00005JLR1", "B00005T7H1", "B000063V14", "6300276554", "B000009CTR", "6304089201", "0790742322", "0788811002", "B00003CXHR", "6303442447", "6304400225", "B0002YLCHE", "6305310068", "B008OGW5XC", "B000063V8N", "1423178696", "B00000JYLP", "B00003CXJ3", "B00029LO18", "B002VDBRIS", "6303929338", "6303315305", "6304416415", "078880782X", "B000IFRQHC"], "bought_together": ["B000C3L27U"], "also_viewed": ["6303314015", "0788812408", "6304089767", "6302526574", "6304290888", "6305229449", "6302158095", "0788805843", "078881172X", "6302178924", "B00003CXQX", "6304155972", "6302968143", "0788802194", "B000035Z2S", "6303983812", "155890641X", "6304978286", "6302794331", "6300274268", "6303036813", "6300275310", "B00005JL95", "B000C3L27U", "6303534422", "6302320402", "B003L4Y5BW", "6304500831", "0788805533", "6303939015", "6305940932", "6302787068", "B00005RDVV", "6302426200", "6301404440", "B00005JKDQ", "0788812807", "B00004R99N", "6303929338", "B000009CTR", "B00003CX7L", "6302484359", "6305326940", "0788812181", "B000035Z46", "6301991311", "6303168957", "6303925235", "6305319138", "0788806270", "6304416415", "6304400381", "6304089201", "B00000F8J1", "0788811002", "6304400225", "B0034GK74G", "B00016JF2W", "6300274195"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 144750}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.0, "brand": "", "asin": "6303122647", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510VC795MQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]"}

The filmmakers were able to digitally sample what they'd captured of Lee's performance and piece together enough footage to make the movie releasable. Indeed, it is probably more fascinating for that post-production story than for the tale on the screen.The Crowis appropriately cloaked in ominous expressionistic shadows, oozing urban dread and occult menace from every dank concrete crack, but it really adds up to a simple and perfunctory tale of ritual revenge. Guided by a portentous crow (standing in for Poe's raven), Lee plays a deceased rock musician who returns from the grave to systematically torture and kill the outlandishly violent gang of hoodlums who murdered him and his fianc&eacute;e the year before.

In a salute/reworking of the fast-talking comedies of the '40s, we follow Norville Barnes (Tim Robbins) and his amazing rise to the top. But he's only a puppet for the evil Sidney J. Mussburger (Paul Newman), who wants the company for himself. The Coens' design is the real star, and their first big-budget film will stimulate movie fans. The story weakens in the middle, but you will find very few films that move with this much imagination. As a Kate Hepburn hybrid, Jennifer Jason Leigh is wonderful in an almost unplayable role.

{"description": "Woody Allen combined the best parts of his earlier films in creating HANNAH AND HER SISTERS, his 1986 masterwork about the changing relationships among three sisters living in New York City. Hannah (Mia Farrow) has put her acting career aside in order to take care of her family with second husband Elliot (Michael Caine in an Oscar-winning performance). Elliot has fallen in love with Hannah's sister Lee (Barbara Hershey), who herself is feeling suffocated by her cynical, mean-spirited loner of a lover, played with great intensity by Ingmar Bergman regular Max von Sydow. Meanwhile, third sister Holly (Oscar winnner Dianne Wiest) is struggling to find her own voice, working as a caterer while she tries to get her own acting career going. And in the middle of everything is Mickey (Woody Allen at his most neurotic), a television writer who is divorced from Hannah, has dated Holly, and, when he suspects he might have a brain tumor, decides to re-evaluate his life and his faith in God. HANNAH AND HER SISTERS is Allen's most fully realized, optimistic adult comedy. He won a well-deserved Oscar for his marvelous screenplay, filled with his trademark sharp, witty dialogue, his undying passion for New York (its culture, architecture, music, romance), and some of his most well-developed characters. The cast is extraordinary, the music illuminating, the settings magnificent. Taking place over the course of a few Thanksgivings, Allen's insightful, wonderful film is a thoroughly enjoyable mature look at the trials, tribulations, and triumphs of family life.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005AUJL", "6301963911", "6301964365", "6304039166", "630146494X", "6300216365", "6301972147", "6301971922", "630228175X", "6302718910", "0800102371", "6303430546", "6303011411", "B0000068DV", "6302697042", "6300251012"]}, "price": 13.31, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 442883}, "asin": "6303232663", "imUrl": "http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-site/icons/no-img-sm._CB192198896_.gif", "title": "Hannah &amp; Her Sisters [VHS]"}
{"description": "This 1946 film celebrates the life, career, and showmanship of the late Florenz Ziegfeld, perhaps the most famous and influential Broadway producer in the early decades of the 20th century. The film, ostensibly directed by Vincente Minnelli, takes an unusual form. We open in Heaven, at the home of the late Ziegfeld (played by William Powell, who also played him inThe Great Ziegfeld), who thinks back on his life and wonders what kind of show he would put on with the talent of today (meaning 1946). What follows is an elaborately staged revue, similar to the blend of cheesecake, music, and comedy that made up the Ziegfeld Follies--but with the stars of that moment (plus actual Ziegfeld veteran Fanny Brice). The most welcome presence is Fred Astaire, who appears in three numbers--including the only dance number ever filmed that paired Astaire with Gene Kelly at the height of their powers. The contrast is fascinating. Otherwise, you get a number of musical scenes, the best of which features Lena Horne (singing \"Love\"), the worst Judy Garland (in \"An Interview\"). And there's plenty of other stuff: everything from an Esther Williams water ballet to an excerpt ofLa Traviatato a variety of broadly acted vaudeville skits featuring actors Keenan Wynn, Edward Arnold, Fanny Brice, and Hume Cronyn.--Marshall Fine", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792840836", "6302363292", "0792840860", "0792840844"], "bought_together": ["0792840836"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 455907}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 13.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6303224652", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/517Q1S4V73L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Ziegfeld Follies [VHS]"}

Catherine's early 1950s world is all bookish and brainy, even though she has aspirations toward the romantic (Moreland's idea of a honeymoon is the Belgian Congo with Pygmies; she longs for Hawaii). Einstein and his professor pals, played by Lou Jacobi, Gene Saks, and Joseph Maher, conspire to match their beloved Catherine with the sincere and smart (though not intellectual) Ed.This is a sweet--but not saccharine--story about \"engineering\" the course of true love and the ironic triumph of heart over head. The topnotch performances (which also include Tony Shalhoub and Frank Whaley as fellow mechanics) really draw audiences into this winning movie.--N.F.

{"description": "A textbook example of '50s-era science fiction,Earth vs. the Flying Saucersboasts not only a solid script and competent performances, but some genuinely impressive stop-motion effects courtesy of one of the industry's uncontested masters, Ray Harryhausen.

The saucers' helmeted pilots land on Earth and deliver an ultimatum to humanity via Marlowe: fealty or complete annihilation.Harryhausen's painstakingly intricate saucers and the destruction they wreak (particularly during an assault on Washington, D.C.) are the film's unquestionable highlights, but Marlowe and Joan Taylor (as his wife/partner) are capable leads, and veteran B director Fred F. Sears doesn't let the dialogue and expositional scenes fall apart in between the barrage of effects.Earth vs. the Flying Saucersis a fun and effective slice of sci-fi that should please younger audiences as well as nostalgic return viewers.

{"description": "If aliens came down to earth to see if humanity was worth saving, showing themShort Cuts, Robert Altman's bluesy riff on life in L.A. in the '90s, would not be a good idea. Based on the stories of Raymond Carver (adapted by Altman and Frank Barhydt), this ambitious film is a devilish valentine to living in L.A., where happiness comes at a premium. There are at least eight separate stories that crisscross, most about people who choose not to relate to the lives they are living. Seemingly by design, none of the stories (nor the performances for that matter) have more impact than the others--this is a true mosaic film. The most representative plot deals with a group of friends (Buck Henry, Fred Ward, and Huey Lewis) who decide to keep fishing even after discovering a body in the river. The story works as a morose comedy and a flag holder for the movie: the inability to take the correct action. Others would rather talk about seeing Alex Trebek than discuss their faltering relationships. A huge and talented cast twists in the wind, bumping into moments of truth, sex, and passion. Some even come out all right in the end. The accidental nature of life--a common theme in many Altman films--has never been so maddeningly persistent, or absorbing. The score by Mark Isham with songs sung by Annie Ross (also a cast member) fuels the moodiness, as does the opening number in which Medfly helicopters spray the town to the tune \"Prisoner of Life.\" Delivering the film a year after his biggest hit in two decades,The Player, Altman proved his artistic tenacity as an aged artist with the heart of a new filmmaker: he's not afraid of risking it all.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300181723", "B0001DHSHE"], "also_viewed": ["6301826558"]}, "price": 22.18, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 432267}, "asin": "6303995705", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51D5MBSWWML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Short Cuts [VHS]"}
{"description": "This haunting classic of the silent screen is familiar to every graduate of Film 101. Like Eisenstein'sBattleship Potemkin, Godard'sBreathless, and Welles'sCitizen Kane, Caligari helped define a cinematic school... and forever changed the way the world made movies. It's also great fun, even for modern audiences.The film begins with two men trading horror stories. One promises the other a terrifying true tale--the harrowing story of his fianc&eacute;e's narrow escape from death. Here's the story: an amoral asylum director wants to see if he can order somnambulist patient Cesare to commit murder. To this end, the nefarious doctor masquerades as a traveling showman and picks victims from the gawking carnival crowds. He sends his sleepwalker out to execute bloody deeds by night--crimes of which Cesare is barely aware. Soon, Cesare abducts the narrator's girl and is caught ... which is only the beginning of the surprises.Caligari's world became the textbook example of 1920s German Expressionist cinema--a cockeyed dreamscape, where black-clad actors feverishly chase each other across moody, barely-realistic sets.

{"description": "Having developed his skill as a master of contemporary crime drama, writer-director Michael Mann displayed every aspect of that mastery in this intelligent, character-driven thriller from 1995, which also marked the first onscreen pairing of Robert De&nbsp;Niro and Al Pacino. The two great actors had played father and son in the separate time periods ofThe Godfather, Part&nbsp;II, but this was the first film in which the pair appeared together, and although their only scene together is brief, it's the riveting fulcrum of this high-tech cops-and-robbers scenario. De&nbsp;Niro plays a master thief with highly skilled partners (Val Kilmer and Tom Sizemore) whose latest heist draws the attention of Pacino, playing a seasoned Los Angeles detective whose investigation reveals that cop and criminal lead similar lives. Both are so devoted to their professions that their personal lives are a disaster. Pacino's with a wife (Diane Venora) who cheats to avoid the reality of their desolate marriage; De&nbsp;Niro pays the price for a life with no outside connections; and Kilmer's wife (Ashley Judd) has all but given up hope that her husband will quit his criminal career. These are men obsessed, and as De&nbsp;Niro and Pacino know, they'll both do whatever's necessary to bring the other down. Mann's brilliant screenplay explores these personal obsessions and sacrifices with absorbing insight, and the tension mounts with some of the most riveting action sequences ever filmed--most notably a daylight siege that turns downtown Los Angeles into a virtual war zone of automatic gunfire. At nearly three hours, the film qualifies as a kind of intimate epic, certain to leave some viewers impatiently waiting for more action, but it's all part of Mann's compelling strategy.Heatis a true rarity: a crime thriller with equal measures of intense excitement and dramatic depth, giving De&nbsp;Niro and Pacino a prime showcase for their finely matched talents.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000003KHS", "6300183211", "B00000IO4G", "630018627X", "6303421563", "B00000JGEI", "6302415853", "630018403X", "0800199421", "6304258984", "0784011923", "6304259131", "6302482712", "6303953425", "B00007CVYA", "0783223218", "6300214540", "6302054982", "0790731274", "B00000ILE6", "0792147618", "079073799X", "6301208773", "6301888901", "0790701251", "0792133153", "6302378648", "6302282535", "6305718792", "6304414099", "6303696813", "0790748169", "B0002ZDVFE", "B000077VT7", "6303269834", "6302516919", "630428649X", "B00008R9K9", "6303036570", "6302814782", "0792116887", "0792158261", "0790705141", "6304508611", "6301071379", "B00005Q4GY", "076783819X", "6300214567", "6303020089", "6303383300", "6302945089", "B0002GTWOM", "B00003CXE6", "0792841778", "6301797930", "0800116917", "0800179552", "B0000040EJ", "B00005A7VC", "6300182878"], "also_viewed": ["B000003KHS"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 286071}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.98, "brand": "", "asin": "6304214502", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4160ZFH45VL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Heat [VHS]"}

{"description": "Romance at its most anti-romantic--that is the Billy Wilder stamp of genius, and this Best Picture Academy Award winner from 1960 is no exception. Set in a decidedly unsavory world of corporate climbing and philandering, the great filmmaker's trenchant, witty satire-melodrama takes the office politics of a corporation and plays them out in the apartment of lonely clerk C.C. Baxter (Jack Lemmon). By lending out his digs to the higher-ups for nightly extramarital flings with their secretaries, Baxter has managed to ascend the business ladder faster than even he imagined. The story turns even uglier, though, when Baxter's crush on the building's melancholy elevator operator (Shirley MacLaine) runs up against her long-standing affair with the big boss (a superbly smarmy Fred MacMurray). The situation comes to a head when she tries to commit suicide in Baxter's apartment. Not the happiest or cleanest of scenarios, and one that earned the famously caustic and cynically humored Wilder his share of outraged responses, but looking at it now, it is a funny, startlingly clear-eyed vision of urban emptiness and is unfailingly understanding of the crazy decisions our hearts sometimes make. Lemmon and MacLaine are ideally matched, and while everyone cites Wilder'sSome Like It Hotclosing line \"Nobody's perfect\" as his best, MacLaine's no-nonsense final words--\"Shut up and deal\"--are every bit as memorable. Wilder won three Oscars forThe Apartment, for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Screenplay (cowritten with longtime collaborator I.A.L. Diamond).--Robert Abele", "related": {"also_bought": ["1558807780", "6300216233", "6304039530", "0800113055", "6301607929", "6301973259", "6300183890", "6302226899", "6300183513", "6301973232", "6300268470", "6301670159", "6301798503", "6300215644", "630266232X", "6304039522", "0782008348", "0783236352", "B00000GJ2B", "6301670140", "0792108868", "630196912X", "0790743213", "B0000040EO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 362176}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.39, "brand": "", "asin": "6304308388", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51VQCSN36TL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Apartment [VHS]"}
{"description": "Goldie Hawn, Bette Midler, and Diane Keaton prove that revenge is a dish best served cold. Former college buddies, they reunite at the funeral of a dear friend who took a swan dive onto Fifth Avenue. All three discover they share the same unhappy history of husbands who dove into middle-age by dumping them for trophy wives. Forming a warring triumvirate, they decide to get even, and along the way remind themselves of long-forgotten capabilities. The action gets a little too \"wacky\" at times, but the gals are great. Portraying an aging actress, Hawn is sometimes a little too flamboyant, but there is much fun to be had in her flashiness, especially when she pokes fun at Tinseltown and her persona. Instead of her usual brashness, Midler stretches herself and shows us a woman who is not just unhappy, but also deeply sorrowful. Not that she isn't quick with a wisecrack, but her expressive face alone tells the story of her marriage. As the repressed and guilt-ridden spouse of a self- involved ad executive, Keaton finds her anger, and her voice, when her psychiatrist (Marcia Gay Harden) oversteps ethical boundaries. Watching Keaton grow from an ineffectual homemaker into a powerful businessperson reminds us that it has been far too long since she has done a comedy. Director Hugh Wilson smartly chose supporting players who each brought something unique to the film.

{"description": "After years of enduring Roger Moore in the role of James Bond, it was good to have Sean Connery back in this 1983 film for a one-time-only trip down 007's memory lane. Connery's Bond, a bit of a dinosaur in the British secret service at (then) 52, is still in demand during times of crisis. Sadly, the film is not very good. In this rehash ofThunderball, Bond is pitted against a worthy underwater villain (Klaus Maria Brandauer); and while the requisite Bond Girls include beauties Kim Basinger and Barbara Carrera, they can't save the movie. The script has several truly dumb passages, among them a (gasp) video-game duel between 007 and his nemesis that now looks utterly anachronistic. For Connery fans, however, this widescreen print of the Irvin Kershner (The Empire Strikes Back) film is a chance to say a final goodbye to a perfect marriage of actor and character.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000NDEXPM", "B000M53GMW", "B000RPCK24", "B001R10BN2", "6302380596", "630238060X", "B000RPCK1U", "6302510198", "B000RPCK1A", "6302510031", "6303651461", "B00004TYS8", "6303651488", "6302510015", "630251018X", "6302510023", "6302510007", "B0000068SI", "B000RPCK0Q", "6302380588", "6304047843", "B00005JL0I", "B001PPLIEG", "6302380294", "B000M53GMC", "B000NIBUS0", "B00008V2VP", "630251004X", "6305784906", "B00004RWUH", "B000RPCK1K", "B000NIBUR6", "B000M53GNG", "B000M53GN6", "B00AQSN7HE", "B000M53GLS", "B001EDVNNU", "B000NIBURG", "B000M53GM2", "B000NDEXPC", "B007REV4T8", "B000NIBURQ", "B00004RG62", "6304032579", "B004BR7XLM", "6302824613", "B00004W9C7", "6301308913", "B00005LIRF", "6300216500", "630442972X", "6304508611", "6302409829", "6304674228", "6303313345", "6300216721", "B00004RG68", "6303696813", "630280096X", "6303212263", "6302360978", "B00004WZR1", "6303686796", "0792835018", "B00004RNAC", "6300181405", "630281622X", "B00000K2SO", "6304259131", "0793941520", "630105573X", "B00000F13T", "0792116887", "6302299497", "079074886X", "0792133153", "0783223218", "6302096316"], "bought_together": ["B000M53GMW", "B000NDEXPM"], "also_viewed": ["B009L6S5EC", "B00AZFECS6", "630238060X", "B00000K2SO", "6302510023", "B001AQO3U6", "6303651488"]}, "price": 17.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 507251}, "asin": "6304406096", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41bUcYAbPbL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Never Say Never Again [VHS]"}

Fox, and Sally Field. They don't actually speak (like the clever critters inBabe), but we hear their &quot;voices&quot; as the lost household pets--Shadow the golden retriever, Chance the bulldog, and Sassy the cat--survive a harrowing series of adventures as they struggle to find their way home.  Perfect entertainment for kids, this frequently clever movie offers an abundance of wildlife and beautiful location scenery, and the vocal performances by Ameche, Fox, and Field are surprisingly effective.

{"description": "TakeThe Full Monty, add a sharper emotional edge, and replace the strutting strippers with a dignified British band. That's the essence ofBrassed Off, a bittersweet gem released in 1996, a year before its more popular (and Oscar-nominated) counterpart. In the Yorkshire town of Grimley, there has always been a coal mine, just as for the last 111 years there has been a brass band, and it seems that Danny (the wondrous Pete Postlethwaite) has been the director for every one of those years.  Tory economic policies, however, are closing coal mines around the country in favor of nuclear power, and Grimley appears to be next on the list.  Danny is unfazed by the threat, claiming, \"It's music that matters.\"  But some of the men are about to quit the band until the appearance of Gloria (Tara Fitzgerald at her most radiant), who dazzles the all-male group (including old flame Andy, played by Ewan McGregor) first with her beauty, then with her fl&uuml;gelhorn playing. The new member gives the band a boost as they continue to perform and compete, but closure remains very real, as director Mark Herman (Little Voice) accompanies the band's performances (played with gusto by theGrimethorpe Colliery Band) with scenes of angry labor-management confrontations and family strife.  In this context, some of the characters claim that the music is an irresponsible form of escapism.  It becomes clear, however, from a touching performance of \"Danny Boy\" to the stirring conclusion at Royal Albert Hall, that music is an expression of the human spirit, a bit of beauty and sanity in a harsh world. With defiance, the band can play \"Land of Hope and Glory,\" even when the land offers them neither.--David Horiuchi", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 437469}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 13.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6304707029", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/512PC4G84VL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Brassed Off [VHS]"}

{"description": "Helen Mirren's Detective Chief Inspector Jane Tennison, the only female DCI on an old boy's club London homicide squad, is like a phantom lurking around the edges of the action while the men rush through their latest murder case, joshing and winking in the kind of male camaraderie the cop genre has celebrated for decades. When DCI Shefford dies of a sudden heart attack, Tennison demands to take over. Despite her superintendent's resistance (\"Give her this case and she'll start expecting more.\"), she becomes the squad's first woman to head a murder investigation. Scrutinized at every moment by her superior officers, Tennison is faced with a case that spirals out from a single murder to a serial spree, a second-in-command who undermines her authority and her investigation at every turn, a team resistant to taking orders from a woman, and a private life unraveling due to her professional diligence. Lynda La Plant's script is a compelling thriller riddled with ambiguity that turns dead ends, blind alleys, and the mundane legwork of real-life cops into fascinating details. Mirren commands the role of Tennison with authority, intelligence, and a touch of overachieving desperation. Superb performances, excellent writing, and understated direction make this BBC miniseries one of the most involving mysteries in years.

{"description": "This stirring and heartfelt tribute is also a real-life fairy tale: the story of Sergei Grinkov and Ekaterina Gordeeva. They met in their native Moscow and were paired when she was only 11 and he was 15. Together they won four World Championships and gold medals in the 1988 and 1994 Olympics pairs skating competitions--and together, they fell in love. Inseparable, Sergei and Ekaterina were soulmates both on and off the ice. Then, at the age of 28, Sergei died of sudden heart failure. This is the story of their life together, as told in Ekaterina's own words, for their daughter, Daria. A unique combination of re-enactment, actual skating clips, and interviews with fellow skaters Scott Hamilton, Kristi Yamaguchi, and Victor Petrenko, it brings the romance and tragedy of these champions vividly to life. 1998, 90 minutes.", "related": {"also_bought": ["0316329940", "B000051S69", "6301600819", "B0001MKWO6", "6303037410", "6302973376", "044652087X", "6302314569", "6301934628", "0791049485", "6303966160", "0446605336", "B000051S67", "0791058557", "B0001GCA9W", "B0001GC9UW", "B00016XN02", "630481206X", "1575664666", "6303443079", "B000051S66"], "bought_together": ["044652087X"], "also_viewed": ["0316329940", "B006NZCVGW", "0791058557", "044652087X"]}, "price": 22.95, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 260354}, "asin": "6304907311", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51CEQHZRA4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "My Sergei [VHS]"}

{"description": "The popular children's books by Mary Norton have been filmed before, but never with as much imagination and ingenuity as you'll find on display in this delightful fantasy film released to critical praise in 1998. The \"Borrowers\" of the title are a family of tiny people who live in the walls and under the floorboards in the homes of \"normal-sized\" humans; they earn their by \"borrowing\" the household items (string, food crumbs, buttons, etc.) needed to furnish their tiny hiding places and provide their meals. The little Clock family lives happily undisturbed in the home of an aged aunt, but when the aunt dies and her will is stolen by an unscrupulous lawyer (John Goodman), the Clocks face eviction and the frightening hazards of the outside world. Under the ingenious direction of Peter Hewitt, this simple, straightforward movie mixes comedy, adventure, and suspense with some of the cleverest special effects you've ever seen, taking full advantage of effects technologies to immerse you in the world of the tiny people. A climactic chase scene in a milk-bottling plant is a visual tour de force, and the movie's smart and dazzling enough to entertain parents and children alike. After its modest success in theaters,The Borrowersstands a good chance of becoming a home-video favorite.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JG6M", "B00E3QJ89Q", "B00BTYSIWI", "B00AEFYO08", "B000QRIKBI", "B0006GANV4", "0152049150", "0152047379", "B000068QPM", "B000065V42", "B0000VCZKW", "0783227337", "B000089779", "B00LG6XHDY", "B0006J28MI", "1558908404", "B005LAIGX2", "B001SXZ7T2", "B0001AW14C", "B00AKGG6X4", "B00KHA8992", "B000056T4I", "6305320950", "B000BPL2GK", "B000H6SY6O", "B000065V44", "6304698623", "B0009NZ2XS", "B0000AUHQR", "B0001I562I", "B00008977A", "B00443FMZM", "B000031EGV", "B0019ESNGO", "B000E0WJOG", "B000FVQLM0", "B0052MXJ3Q", "6304711867", "B000XKW2WG", "B000HT389E", "6305236585", "6305870179", "B000089778", "B00008L3U1", "B000089771", "0783231474", "B001SXZ7TM", "B00003CXJ4", "B0015RRNN4", "B00005RDSQ", "0783232292", "B001KX50AQ", "B00004R99F", "0783231644", "B00007LVCM", "0783231210", "B000EOMB9U", "B000089799", "B000RW3VCU", "B00008L3SY", "B000A2WARE", "B00009YXAW", "B0000VV4WW", "B002DVP7T8", "B001THIQFO", "B00008979B", "B004GJYROG", "B002GHHHNI", "B000FCW15A", "B002JUFPX6", "0767836324", "B00002SSKI", "B004GJYRF0", "B0024FADAQ", "B00005RRG7", "B002GIBVV6", "B0006GANUK", "B00008979O", "B001ILFUD2", "B00005NKT5", "B00AENNHOE", "B00007ELEU", "0783219806", "B000065V43", "B004SEUIWY", "B0000AK7AA", "B000CEPE5A", "B0084IHVGG", "B00A2H9UG6", "B0000633U4", "B000F1IQNM", "B004VMWTIO", "B002BIGCXS", "B000Y11B7G", "B0055HK792", "B0002RQ0XC", "B0000VV4W2", "B0000WN0UU", "B00003CXJ1", "B0000633U2"], "bought_together": ["B00005JG6M", "B00BTYSIWI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005JG6M", "B00H5NY7KY", "B00BTYSIWI", "B00AEFYO08"]}, "price": 22.97, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 274002}, "asin": "6305035105", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51JXEPWQP0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Borrowers"}
{"description": "Making this movie represented a rather risky venture for Mel Gibson--it was his first effort at directing, and the role demanded that he deliberately obscure his sexy matinee-idol looks. Gibson seems to truly relish his Lon Chaney Jr.-esque turn as Justin McLeod, a reclusive former teacher with half his face and body badly scarred, and a dark, secret past. The folks in McLeod's postcard-pretty Maine town have dubbed him \"Hamburger Head\" and exchange malicious gossip about him. But one boy is needy enough to dare to penetrate the fortress McLeod has built against the outside world. Fatherless Chuck Norstadt (Nick Stahl) is so anxious to escape his dysfunctional family that he pesters McLeod into becoming his mentor. Their relationship for the most part avoids the sort of sticky sentimentality one might expect from Hollywood. Chuck is a real, credible kid, a petulant pain with a chip on his shoulder, and McLeod is no Mr. Chips. It's fun, and quite moving, to watch these two cranky misfits battle their way toward a friendship that will change both their lives. Margaret Whitton (Major League) gives an unaffected performance as Chuck's narcissistic mother. \"I'm just not cut out for this mothering racket,\" she tells her rudderless children, as she flits from man to man. Gibson's own personal code of honor, we suspect, is very much in evidence in this movie's message: One must take responsibility for what one wants in life.--Laura Mirsky", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 450110}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6305012814", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5128XQKSB4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Man Without A Face [VHS]"}
{"description": "If you were to argue that Mel Brooks'sYoung Frankensteinranks among the top-ten funniest movies of all time, nobody could reasonably dispute the claim. Spoofing classic horror in the way that Brooks's previous filmBlazing Saddlessent up classic Westerns, the movie is both a loving tribute and a raucous, irreverent parody of Universal's classic horror filmsFrankenstein(1931) andBride of Frankenstein(1935). Filming in glorious black and white, Brooks re-created theFrankensteinlaboratory using the same equipment from the originalFrankenstein(courtesy of designer Kenneth Strickfaden), and this loving attention to physical and stylistic detail creates a solid foundation for nonstop comedy. The story, of course, involves Frederick Frankenstein (Gene Wilder) and his effort to resume experiments in re-animation pioneered by his late father. (He's got some help, since dad left behind a book titledHow I Did It.) Assisting him is the hapless hunchback Igor (Marty Feldman) and the buxom but none-too-bright maiden Inga (Teri Garr), and when Frankenstein succeeds in creating his monster (Peter Boyle), the stage is set for an outrageous revision of the Frankenstein legend. With comedy highlights too numerous to mention, Brooks guides his brilliant cast (also including Cloris Leachman, Madeline Kahn, Kenneth Mars, and Gene Hackman in a classic cameo role) through scene after scene of inspired hilarity. Indeed,Young Frankensteinis a charmed film, nothing less than a comedy classic, representing the finest work from everyone involved. Not one joke has lost its payoff, and none of the countless gags have lost their zany appeal. From a career that includes some of the best comedies ever made, this is the film for which Mel Brooks will be most fondly remembered. Befitting a classic, the Special Edition DVD includes audio commentary by Mel Brooks, a \"making of\" documentary, interviews with the cast, hilarious bloopers and outtakes, and the original theatrical trailers. No video library should be without a copy ofYoung Frankenstein.

{"description": "Changes must be expected when a classic book or stage show becomes a movie. In  this 1939Mikado, efforts were made to respect the original. Stars of the D'Oyly  Carte Company were hired for key roles and performed them in their  traditional style, with the D'Oyly Carte Chorus, London Symphony Orchestra, and a director (Victor Schertzinger) who was also a conductor and knew the music.An introductory scene was added to clarify the plot, and other small adjustments were made. Several songs were left out or abbreviated, and one song, \"The sun, whose rays,\" was sung twice, by Nanki-Poo and by Yum-Yum, for whom it was written. A popular tenor of the time, Kenny Baker, sang Nanki-Poo with good, light tone, but in his own non-traditional style. These departures from tradition may infuriate hard-core Gilbert and Sullivan fans, but others will hardly notice. The visuals are gorgeous, the sound not up to present standards but clear and accurate.

{"description": "Peter Weir directed this comedy-drama, a commentary on all-pervasive media manipulation. Scripted by Andrew M. Niccol (Gattaca), the film plays like a combination of the British TV series The Prisoner and Paul Bartel's The Secret Cinema. Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey) is unaware that his entire life is a hugely popular 24-hour-a-day TV series. In this real-time documentary, every moment of Truman's existence is captured by concealed cameras and telecast to a giant global audience. His friends and family are actors who smile pleasantly at Truman's familiar catchphrase greeting, \"In case I don't see you later, good afternoon, good evening, and good night!\" Employed at an insurance company, Truman is married to merry Meryl (Laura Linney), and they live in the cheerful community of Seahaven, an island \"paradise\" where the weather is always mild and no unpleasantness intrudes. This is the basic situation of the series, which has grown over the years into a billion-dollar franchise for the TV network. As an unwanted pregnancy, Truman was adopted by the network and raised in the zoolike environment of a TV soundstage. Thus, the TV audience became hooked when Truman was very young. Now, at age 30, he still doesn't know he's a prisoner on an immense domed city-size soundstage, simulating Seahaven. Both the illusion and the ratings will collapse if Truman ever leaves Seahaven. In addition to elaborate events staged to make sure he stays put, Truman is given constant reminders of how wonderful Seahaven is compared to dangers in other parts of the world. However, his growing suspicions make him curious enough to try to leave, and the show's director and master manipulator Christof (Ed Harris) must constantly devise ways to thwart Truman's escape attempts. To enter the harbor, Truman must overcome his fear of water, intentionally instilled in him when his father \"died\" in a boating accident and was written out of the script.", "related": {"also_bought": ["0790731649"], "bought_together": ["0790731649"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 319413}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.0, "brand": "", "asin": "630518299X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GRFF4KA1L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Truman Show [VHS]"}
{"description": "Francis Ford Coppola was working as an assistant to Roger Corman when he made this, his feature debut.  The story goes that Corman let Coppola make the film so long as he could work around the shooting schedule of the film they were working on together, and the results are impressive given the budget constraints. Or maybebecauseof the budget constraints.  The story concerns the family at Castle Haloran, the secrets surrounding the death of young Kathleen, and an axe murderer who seems to be picking away at all present.  Coppola's deft direction keeps this from being a routine ghost story, using light and dark in his compositions to create tension and suspense.  The film has an interesting way of spanning the traditional ghost story and the more modern gore-fests that we're used to.  I have one bone to pick with the manufacturer of this disc: the transfer to DVD was made from tape.

DVD consumers want all the benefits of this medium, and not to have the degraded quality of tape preserved on it.  If this is the only way you can get this film, at least the price is reasonable.

{"description": "Take away the Fairy Godmother, and what have you got left from the Cinderella fable? The story of a girl for whom a bad stroke of luck is no match for her internal strength and purity of heart. Drew Barrymore plays Cinderella's alleged inspiration, Danielle, in this romantic drama that purports to tell the \"facts\" behind the Grimm brothers' story. One of three daughters of a man (Jeroen Krabb&eacute;) who dies and leaves her fate in the hands of a conniving stepmother (Anjelica Huston), Danielle is cast into the lowly role of a servant. Meanwhile, her sisters are evaluated as possible mates for a French prince (Dougray Scott), but he's far more intrigued with Danielle's intelligence and beauty--not to mention her way with a sword and fist. Directed by Andy Tennant (who directed Barrymore in TV'sThe Amy Fisher Story),Ever Afterhas that rare ability to win the heart and mind of a viewer simply by being committed to its own innocence, particularly where Barrymore's luminous performance is concerned. A contemporary take on an old, virtually forgotten Hollywood convention--the costume adventure with middling artistic ambition but real audience appeal--Ever Afteris a surprisingly delightful film.--Tom Keogh", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 312567}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.58, "brand": "", "asin": "6305265488", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51XH5A8YFWL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Ever After - A Cinderella Story [VHS]"}
{"description": "Werner Herzog's remake of F.W. Murnau'soriginal vampire classicis at once a generous tribute to the great German director and a distinctly unique vision by one of cinema's most idiosyncratic filmmakers. Though Murnau'sNosferatuwas actually an unauthorized adaptation of Bram  Stoker'sDracula, Herzog based his film largely on Murnau's conceptions--at times directly quoting Murnau's images--but manages to slip in a few references to Tod Browning'sfamous version(at one point the vampire comments on the howling wolves: \"Listen, the children of the night make their music.\"). Longtime Herzog star Klaus Kinski is both hideous and melancholy as Nosferatu (renamed Count Dracula in the English language version). As in Murnau's film, he's a veritable gargoyle with his bald pate and sunken eyes, and his talon-like fingernails and two snaggly fangs give him a distinctly feral quality. But Kinski's haunting eyes also communicate a gloomy loneliness--the curse of his undead immortality--and his yearning for Lucy (Isabelle Adjani) becomes a melancholy desire for love. Bruno Ganz's sincere but foolish Jonathan is doomed to the vampire's will and his wife, Lucy, a holy innocent whose deathly pallor and nocturnal visions link her with the ghoulish Nosferatu, becomes the only hope against the monster's plague-like curse. Herzog's dreamy, delicate images and languid pacing create a stunningly beautiful film of otherworldly mood, a faithful reinterpretation that by the conclusion has been shaped into a quintessentially Herzog vision.--Sean Axmaker", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 272814}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "title": "Nosferatu the Vampyre [VHS]", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000056NW6", "6302783356", "B000VUQ4HW", "6304509154"], "also_viewed": ["6302194296", "B00EO2I6RO"]}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5123FXMFFAL._SY300_.jpg", "asin": "630526323X"}

{"description": "There's Something About Maryis one of the funniest movies in years, recalling the days of the Zucker-Abraham-Zucker movies, in which (often tasteless) gags were piled on at a fierce rate. The difference is that cowriters and codirectors Bobby and Peter Farrelly have also crafted a credible story line and even tossed in some genuine emotional content.The Farrelly brothers' first two movies,Dumb and DumberandKingpin, had some moments of uproarious raunch, but were uneven. WithMary, they've created a consistently hilarious romantic comedy, made all the funnier by the fact that you know that they know that some of their gags go way over the line.Cameron Diaz stars as Mary, every guy's ideal. Ben Stiller plays a high-school suitor still hung up on Mary years later; the obstacles standing between him and her include a number of psychotic suitors, a miserable little pooch, and, oh yeah, a murder charge.The Farrellys' admittedly simplistic camera work, which adapts easily to a TV screen, and the fact that you'll likely laugh yourself so silly over certain scenes you'll want to replay them to see what you were missing while you were busy convulsing, make this a perfect video movie.--David Kronke", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300214567"], "also_viewed": ["B00004YZEG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 467528}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 0.01, "brand": "", "asin": "6305499071", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41T5QB162RL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "There's Something About Mary (Special Edition) [VHS]"}

{"description": "In 1996, composer, producer, and guitar legend Ry Cooder entered Egrem Studios in Havana with the forgotten greats of Cuban music, many of them in their 60s and 70s, some of them long since retired. The resulting album,Buena Vista Social Club, became a Grammy-winning international bestseller. When Cooder returned to Havana in 1998 to record a solo album by 72-year-old vocalist Ibrahim Ferrer, filmmaker Wim Wenders was on hand to document the occasion. Wenders splits the film between portraits of the performers, who tell their stories directly to the camera as they wander the streets and neighborhoods of Havana, and a celebration of the music heard in performance scenes in the studio, in their first concert in Amsterdam, and in their second and final concert at Carnegie Hall. The songs are too often cut short in this fashion, butBuena Vista Social Clubis not a concert film. Wenders weaves the artist biographies with a glimpse of modern Cuba remembering its past, capturing a lost culture in music that is suddenly, unexpectedly revived for audiences in Havana and around the world. Wenders makes his presence practically invisible, as if his directorial flourishes or off-screen narration might deflect attention from the artists, who do a fine job of telling their own stories through interviews and music. It's a loving portrait of a master class in Cuban music, with a vital cast of aging performers whose energy and passion belie their years.--Sean Axmaker", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 455404}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 0.21, "brand": "", "asin": "B0000203Y5", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41GCEV8VXXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Buena Vista Social Club [VHS]"}
{"description": "With a voracious trio of mako sharks wreaking havoc,Deep Blue  Seadares to up the ante onJaws, but director Renny Harlin trades the nuanced suspense of Spielberg's 1975 blockbuster for the trickery of the digital age. In other words, why build genuine terror when you can show ill-fated humans getting torn into bloody chunks? The aforementioned makos have been lab rats in an effort to harvest a miracle cure for Alzheimer's disease from the brains of sharks, but the research has an unfortunate side effect: the sharks get smarter, and they're determined to break out of Aquatica, the deep-sea complex where they've been penned.Model-actress Saffron Burrows plays the researcher; Thomas Jane pulls double-duty as shark expert and action hunk; Samuel&nbsp;L. Jackson's the corporate sponsor who chooses theworsttime for an Aquatica tour; and rapper LL&nbsp;Cool&nbsp;J is nicely cast as Aquatica's cook and comic  relief. Michael Rapaport, Jacqueline McKenzie, and Stellan Skarsg&aring;rd round out the cast, most of whom are turned into shark food as the makos turn Aquatica into a floating junkyard. Harlin takes devilish pleasure in providing sudden, unexpected shocks--no small feat in such a derivative thriller--and  as a series of action set-pieces,Deep Blue Seanever disappoints. It's inevitable that Burrows should end up in her underwear like Sigourney Weaver inAlien, but even then the movie offers a credible reason for the strip-down; thatDeep Blue Seacan be simultaneously ridiculous and sensible is just another one of its shlocky charms.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B008DL4LQ2", "0767802497", "B00008WFU5", "B0006HBZYC", "B00008WFU4", "B00005A8XX", "6305090564", "B004USUP58", "B003VA3JUO", "B000WTVZGC", "B002NZK5U0", "B00AEFYXQI", "6305943133", "B007STBUHI", "B003ZZ7TPG", "0783225547", "B001YYQ9S8", "B00153ZR8G", "B00AIZ2FPK", "B00005O5B5", "B00064X5L6", "B00064AE0G", "B00AEFYSR2", "B000JBXHQY", "B0002V7OI8", "B00E8G5HQE", "B005CHV14A", "B004FHCHAU", "B00018D3UU", "B00DCLTA6Y", "B000BNX3BE", "B003ABZG14", "B003954IV0", "B00BTYNXJG", "B000NVT0TI", "0767817478", "B000N4RAS8", "B000ASATZ8", "B00000IQC4", "B001DSNEK6", "B00000IQVQ", "B00000G3PA", "B004K4FUVQ", "B00008G8M4", "B002O3Z50G", "0783237413", "B00004STDN", "B004XVMCN0", "B002ZG98LO", "0792839684", "B00005UQ9W", "B000PFU83O", "B0010X73ZG", "B00013RC7K", "B00AEFXPMG", "B004LWZW6K", "B00005JOWW", "B00003L9CQ", "B004AC6PV2", "B0002W4SBI", "B000WTVZGW", "B003UN0752", "B0002IQMAM", "B00005JM5B", "B00BNAE14W", "B00AEFXPSK", "B004P7CN7W", "B000X0GWNG", "B00005RYKU", "B00004Z4WR", "0767824954", "B000BUNZY2", "B00008G8LY", "B00317LM8S", "B00111YM56", "B00003CXKA", "B00600SOXE", "B00005JMXX", "B00AEFY6PQ", "B00005JMZK", "6304806434", "B0045HCJ0S", "B00BTYOYG2", "B000AM4P9K", "B004W7D1G2", "B00AEFYV9W", "B002ZG98KK", "B0001FR3IQ", "B00009WVSL", "B0057RCFQS", "B004EPZ08O", "B00003CXO1", "B000CSUNLG", "B003PIUINS", "B001ECDVKE", "B00111YM5Q", "B00IS6WQ5K", "B0021L8UXA", "B00003CXUP"], "bought_together": ["B00008WFU5", "B00008WFU4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0767802497", "B00008WFU4", "B008DL4LQ2", "B00004TDTO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 122500}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.55, "brand": "JACKSON,SAMUEL L.", "asin": "B00002E233", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71TDBGEC1NL._SY300_.gif", "title": "Deep Blue Sea"}

{"description": "A confident hybrid ofM*A*S*H,Treasure of the Sierra Madre, andDr. Strangelove,Three Kingsis one of the most seriously funny war movies ever made. Improving the premise ofKelly's Heroeswith scathing intelligence, it explores the odd connection between war and consumerism in the age of Humvees and cellular phones. Writer-director David O.&nbsp;Russell's third film (afterSpanking the MonkeyandFlirting with Disaster), it's a no-holds-barred portrait of personal conscience in the volatile arena of politics, played out by one of the most gifted filmmakers to emerge in the 1990s.George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg, Ice Cube, and Spike Jonze (director ofBeing John Malkovich) play a quartet of U.S.&nbsp;soldiers who, disillusioned by Operation Desert Storm, decide to steal $23&nbsp;million in gold hijacked from Kuwait by Saddam Hussein's army. Getting the bullion out of an Iraqi stronghold is easy; keeping it is a potentially lethal proposition. By the end of their mercenary mission, the Americans can no longer ignore wartime atrocities (and neither can we--the film is boldly unflinching), and conscience demands their aid to Kuwaiti rebels abandoned by President George Bush's fickle wartime policy. This is serious stuff indeed, but Russell infusesThree Kingswith a keen sense of the absurd, and the entire film is an exercise in breathtaking visual ingenuity. Despite a conventional ending that's mildly disappointing for such a brashly original film,Three Kingsconveys the brutal madness of war while making you laugh out loud at the insanity.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B00DON8NJ0", "B000IYV1ME", "B000O7667K", "B000H1RFKU", "B003ASLJOK", "B000JU7KAE", "B001G8XOMG", "B00DON4TPC", "B001O7JHSO", "B0046BHC6O", "B0021L8URQ", "B001XURJCS", "B001CT877G", "B0013FSXT6", "B002ZG97QU", "B0047BXR1W", "B001HN69CC", "B000JLPMPI", "B000HLDFK4", "B000TGGJKU", "B003L7DK60", "B001AQT0RC", "B001J6NZGU", "B0011VIODW", "B000Q7ZND6", "B000P6XU60", "B000H1RFKK", "B001FB55M6", "B0017TYPIG", "B000O176IO", "B0011E5D2Y", "B000KF0NI4", "B000Q6GX90", "B000LPS4BG", "B000M5AJQI", "B000JUB7LW", "B0015GDVTU", "B000UJ48UO", "B002Z7FM68", "B000I5XOWI", "B000MEYFXW", "B0012YYZYK", "B000PC0U1W", "B003YOZNBK", "B001NCDCQ8", "B000JLSLZQ", "B000R3PDK2", "B001FB55H6", "B0010HOZXA", "B003B1X80Y", "B000JLSM00", "B001O7JHW0", "B006H3MIYA", "B000MQ54OY", "B003UESJHY", "B000Q66J1M", "B006OQ0K0E", "B003TT2X6S", "B001OQCUZW", "B003TT2X6I"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B006H3MIYA", "B002T9H2L0", "B003KGBIS4", "B00HF98SY4"]}, "price": 8.5, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 1098395}, "asin": "B00003CX73", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51BA5ATJSYL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Three Kings"}

{"description": "To callPearl Harbora throwback to old-time war movies is something of an understatement. Director Michael Bay's epic take on the bombing that brought the United States into World War II hijacks every war movie situation and clich&#xE9; (some affectionate, some stale) you've ever seen and gives them a shiny, glossy spin until the whole movie practically gleams. Planes glisten, water sparkles, trees beckon--and Bay's re-creation of the bombing itself, a 30-minute sequence that's tightly choreographed and amazingly photographed, sets the action movie bar up quite a few notches. And in updating the classic war film, Bay and screenwriter Randall Wallace (Braveheart) use that old plot standby, the love triangle--this time, it's between two pilots (Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett) and a nurse (Kate Beckinsale) who find themselves stationed at Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, during what they thought would be a nice, sunny tour of duty. Then, of course, history intervened.For the first 90 minutes of the movie, Affleck and Beckinsale find a nice, appealing chemistry that plays on his strengths as a movie star and hers as a serious actress--he gives her glamour, she gives him smarts. Their truncated romance--the beginning of which is told in flashback so we can get right to the point where he has to leave her to go to England--works, thanks to their charm. They're no Kate and Leo fromTitanic(a strategy the film strives hard toward), but they're pretty darn adorable in their own right. Hartnett, as the not entirely unwelcome third wheel, squints bravely but makes only a slight dent in the film. Everyone else inPearl Harbor--from Cuba Gooding Jr.'s brave navy seaman to Jon Voight's able impersonation of FDR--is pretty much a glorified walk-on, taking a backseat to the pyrotechnics and action sequences that keep the three-hour film in fairly constant motion. But when that action does take hold,Pearl Harboris quite a thrilling ride.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792151712", "B000059HGY", "B00000K3AN", "B00AEBBA36", "0792133153", "079212569X", "6305169187", "6301734734", "0792147618", "0792116887", "6304618344", "079213690X", "6303269834", "6304925131", "6305718792", "6304259131", "B00004WIDB", "6304935811", "6303057225", "6304143184", "6302250269"], "bought_together": ["B00000K3AN", "B00AEBBA36"], "also_viewed": ["B00000G3PA", "0792151712", "6300213668", "B00000JS61", "6303215734", "6303402348", "B00004WIDB", "079213690X", "6305750750", "B004751DFU", "B00005O893", "B00000K3AN", "6301792734", "B00E5I2MCM", "6305169187", "B00007LVCM", "B007SPPANM", "B00L4K3MLE", "B00FLML7HW", "B008QZ5PY2", "B00JBGWP3Y"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 234413}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.49, "brand": "", "asin": "B00003CXTF", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HC1ZDJN6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]"}
{"description": "The Art of Waris the first action movie with a hero who works for the United Nations--the U.N. Covert Operations Unit, to be specific. Who knew there was such a thing? Wesley Snipes plays Shaw, their top operative, who's unafraid of dropping several stories from one ledge of a skyscraper to another. When the Chinese ambassador is assassinated, it threatens the stability of an impending trade agreement that the secretary-general (played by Donald Sutherland) has worked so hard to achieve. Shaw gets arrested for the assassination, but who's really responsible? Is it the wily Chinese capitalist? A seemingly affable FBI agent? Only a lovely U.N. interpreter (Marie Matiko) believes he's innocent, especially when someone tries to knock her off and Shaw is the only person she can turn to... well, you get the idea. The script is neither original nor comprehensible, but that's not why you'd want to watch a movie likeThe Art of War--it's the action. And the action is pretty good, particularly earlier on when the confusions of the plot don't matter as much. Michael Biehn (The Terminator,The Rock) does a serviceable job as one of Shaw's associates, Anne Archer (Fatal Attraction,Clear and Present Danger) tries to seem complicated as the head of the Covert Operations Unit, and Maury Chaykin (The Mask of Zorro,Devil in a Blue Dress) is dependable as ever as the FBI guy.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001AK3S4E", "B002BOEEVO", "B000PISZ7M", "0790732149", "B004F7BGBG", "B000B8GT92", "B000ELL1Q2", "B0009FU0ZG", "B002AT8KA6", "B000A1OFYQ", "B000HEVZ80", "0790736411", "B0010YVCB6", "B004SIPAP0", "630513345X", "B000QUCRB4", "B00061I294", "6305428115", "B0045HCJGC", "B002O3Z4WK", "B000JYW5BO", "B001N44BVQ", "B000056PNL", "B002A0KV6G", "B00AEFYUQQ", "B0045HCJ5S", "B00140PK82", "B008B9JTLI", "B00J11U54K", "B0002J58HO", "B009WGYXIS", "B0019EXZY4", "B0099KJFJ4", "B002GSXKNI", "B00596WEVI", "B00DU22OI6", "B00005N5S5", "B008E70EES", "6304698747", "B000XA5K48", "B000X1Z0C4", "B008NNY8PO", "B00BUC4TJ0", "B003VA3JZY", "B00003CXW4", "B000CEV3M8", "B0045HCJFS", "B00J5LXST0", "B000I0RNWU", "B00004Z1FX", "B004YCKJGU", "B002AT8K9W", "B002MJV77C", "B00CUDD0J8", "B000JJSL1W", "B0087OULG4", "B00JL6L4UY", "B0041QSZS8", "B000274T94", "B002GHHHME", "0780621603", "B000LC4Z7Q", "B00003CXGV", "B002AS464Q", "B00009ZPUA", "B001VLBDD0", "B004U7MR1O", "B00005OCJP", "B002AS466O", "B004H2P6II", "B00003CXR4", "B002FU8JTW", "0790732238", "B00AIBZMD6", "B00JVQ7RCS", "0767803434", "B000ENC5YW", "B00005JA8B", "B001JV5AZE", "B0001Z37HM", "B00003CXHJ", "B00009L1TA", "6305767866", "B00005UQ9T", "B000HDZKLO", "0783225946", "B007NE07VI", "B00BUAEYVK", "B000G5SILC", "B00BEJL6JK", "0767807588", "B004P8R9O8", "0767817745", "B001EDVNNU", "B002O3Z4XE", "B000E5N684", "B00AEBB9AA", "B005LAIGRS", "B000H5TH20", "B0001NBNDY"], "bought_together": ["B002BOEEVO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0790732149", "B002DY9KQ6", "B000BYA5G4", "B003Q6D2B4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 41525}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.7, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00003CXMV", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5145yVg-h5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Art of War"}

{"description": "Employing shock techniques and sound design in a relentless sensory assault,Requiem for a Dreamis about nothing less than the systematic destruction of hope. Based on the novel by Hubert Selby Jr., and adapted by Selby and director Darren Aronofsky, this is undoubtedly one of the most effective films ever made about the experience of drug addiction (both euphoric and nightmarish), and few would deny that Aronofsky, in following his breakthrough filmPi, has pushed the medium to a disturbing extreme, thrusting conventional narrative into a panic zone of traumatized psyches and bodies pushed to the furthest boundaries of chemical tolerance. It's too easy to call this a cautionary tale; it's a guided tour through hell, with Aronofsky as our bold and ruthless host.The film focuses on a quartet of doomed souls, but it's Ellen Burstyn--in a raw and bravely triumphant performance--who most desperately embodies the downward spiral of drug abuse. As lonely widow Sara Goldfarb, she invests all of her dreams in an absurd self-help TV game show, jolting her bloodstream with diet pills and coffee while her son Harry (Jared Leto) shoots heroin with his best friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) and slumming girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly). They're careening toward madness at varying speeds, and Aronofsky tracks this gloomy process by endlessly repeating the imagery of their deadly routines. Tormented by her dietary regime, Sara even imagines a carnivorous refrigerator in one of the film's most memorable scenes. And yet... does any of this have a point? Is Aronofsky telling us anything that any sane person doesn't already know?Requiem for a Dreamis a noteworthy film, but watching it twice would qualify as masochistic behavior.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0057ZAA6W", "B00005JM23", "6305594333", "B0007CEXYK", "B00005YUPD", "078401213X", "1560252480", "B00H3JHGBC", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00005JMJG", "B000I0QL7I", "B0009A40ES", "B00049QQHI", "B00005ATQB", "B000LAZDPG", "B00003CXZ4", "0792838068", "B0000AC8LR", "0783229526", "6305692572", "B0041KKYEM", "B000QGEB1M", "B00008977H", "B001AR60GK", "B000MGB6NM", "B0045HCJ08", "6305313687", "B001TOD92C", "B00009Y3QI", "B000NO39FG", "B000JBXXYK", "B00008975Z", "6305162026", "B00004UEDQ", "B000068MC2", "B00606OZUY", "B00003CWQR", "B000ERVK4Y", "B000A7DVR2", "B000A9QK6E", "B00EUENWIY", "B0016MJ6T2", "B00005JPAR", "B00008MTXI", "B004SIP95G", "B00AEFXESQ", "B000JMK6LW", "B00004Y6Q5", "B000FVQLQQ", "B000BYA5G4", "B00005JKJA", "B00005JKM2", "B0029LHW68", "B000BBOUUE", "B004FQX5B6", "B000PAAJZ6", "B000N3SU92", "B003YKYX9M", "B00AEBB8O2", "B00007AJF8", "B00A2H9QN8", "B0009WFEDC", "B00GUO2SKA", "B00013RC2K", "B000A7Q2DM", "B00003CXWV", "0792845803", "B001URA5Y8", "B00195I3O0", "B00006AFUR", "B000063JDE", "B00BMKGZVA", "B00AEBB8NI", "B00112S8RS", "B00177YA6U", "0767837398", "B000O76ZQC", "B0052ADP6Y", "B000J10F8C", "B000E6ESU8", "B00009OOFH", "B00005JLRE", "B0059GVBHG", "0767824954", "B00005JLWN", "B00E8G5GU6", "B000QXDCLA", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00004ZETA", "B00AEBB9CS", "B000021Y77", "B00011CZRE", "B002VECM4A", "B00003CXKS", "B006KH6CF4", "B000K7VHQE", "6305127654", "B00AFEXRME", "B004SIP7ZS", "B00020HB32"], "bought_together": ["B0057ZAA6W", "B00005JM23"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005JMJG", "B000MEYKD2", "B0057ZAA6W", "B00005JPAR"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 222264}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 15.36, "brand": "", "asin": "B00003CXP1", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/519CB9K0QML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut"}

When Ying Zheng's peaceful mission explodes into a brutal holocaust, a disillusioned Lady Zhao is forced to question her loyalty and her lover's destiny.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00104AYGK", "B00002RAPT", "B000MRA592", "B004SIP88Y", "B0030A6ICG", "B0000C2IW7", "B0007Q6VXC", "6305460183", "B000EAT23M", "B006MWA91A", "B00005QFE5", "B001F34HT6", "B00005JKG1", "B001MEJY9G", "B006C1S1DY", "B00005JM6H", "B001BHTNAY", "B00003CXR4", "B000065V3B", "B00004Z1FF", "B0019PL2W0", "B000W0H5EM", "B00ENTX7JU", "B00AN5LCXQ", "B007WXUVHU", "B00006HAZL", "B00003CXUM", "B000PMFS6O", "B005KG4CUS", "B00G3HOJZ6", "B00007JZVS", "B000E1EHPE", "B0010SAGHS", "B000BRBA8S", "B00061I29E", "B000KRMSK8", "B0002J4X20", "B004XQO8MS", "B0035JHYHA", "B000MRA59C", "B000W0H5GA", "B0006VL1J2", "0767853512", "B000A1OFZA", "B000AYELXI", "B00B6OEE7O", "B000092T3H", "B00BC1UPRO", "B008645YLM", "B003VMFX1A", "B00004Z1FD", "B009DAYI8S", "B00FRILRRK", "B00065GX0K", "B00ET2ODYY", "B007BMIFN4", "B001TH15XO", "B000683VH0", "B001EOQCMG", "B0000DBJ2D", "B003JT6VAW", "B004TFTE9A", "B002C6VMIY", "B00DJ5IORY", "B0030A6ID0", "B00005N5RN", "0385520182", "B005B0QYSQ", "B000GDH9J6", "B001KEHAEE", "B00IIPL11Q", "B004H2IMSO", "B00004W457", "B000059TON", "B005E2YL3Q", "B001R10BDW", "B000KX0IOA", "B001CD6GL6", "B004H2CXBQ", "B00B6DTFOC", "7885142833", "B0009WIE98", "B00005JN7C", "B000BGH2A4", "B006JD48GY", "B00A0N0318", "B004SEUJEG", "B000EHRVMY", "B00005V8TD", "B005ZMBEXA", "B000ICLU7C", "B000GBEWNY", "B0019Z3P5W", "B00000JS6X", "B005JJCMN0", "B004LE4FKM", "B003EYVXXW", "B00008EY6M", "B005FQ1OOK"], "bought_together": ["B00104AYGK", "B000MRA592"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000MRA592", "B00002RAPT", "B00104AYGK", "B0010SAGHS"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 137107}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 24.81, "brand": "LI,GONG", "asin": "B00004STDA", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51056EH4P7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Emperor and the Assassin"}

{"description": "Who hasn't longed for the simplicity of times past, when life was less convoluted, without the complications of cell phones, e-mail, and chauffeuring kids to soccer games? Well, one episode into PBS's reality seriesThe 1900 Housewill have you rethinking your romanticization of days gone by.Take one modern 1999 family, insert them into a Victorian London house redesigned to exact 1900 standards, focus a camera on them for three months, and you haveThe 1900 House. The Bowler family is a typical family of six (actually, seven--the oldest daughter remained in 1999 to take care of the house): 9-year-old Joe is a computer games addict, teenage Kathryn is a club hopper, and preteen twins Hilary and Ruth are still young enough to be the most mature people in the family. Add mother Joyce, a school inspector on hiatus, and father Paul, a Royal Marine who takes his head-of-the-household role a bit too seriously, and you have an immensely likable family living under incredibly strained circumstances.The first of four episodes focuses on the rebuilding of the house: the removal of the indoor plumbing and electricity, the installation of the coal-burning stove, the planting of the Victorian-era garden, and such. The subsequent three episodes follow the refreshingly fascinating daily life of the Bowler family as they navigate cooking, cleaning, entertaining themselves, and even personal hygiene (Paul learns to cope with a straight-edged razor, and Joyce and Kathryn get a lesson on womanly issues of 1900). Tight editing condenses the three months into four hours, keeping the series fast paced and humorous. Whether you're a reality-TV junkie or have an honest interest in a documentary on Victorian life,The 1900 Housewill certainly delight.--Jenny Brown", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 144137}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"], ["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "title": "The 1900 House:  An Extraordinary Living Experiment [VHS]", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00008G7JA", "B0002BO07Q", "B00009K77X", "B0000AYL47", "B001A5RZZ2", "B00008G7J9", "B000FGG5MQ", "0752217119", "1579590829"], "also_viewed": ["B00008G7JA", "B00009K77X", "B0002BO07Q", "B0000AYL47", "B00CAT3TCU", "B000FGG5MQ", "B000679NFU", "B003NILBFE", "0743442709", "B008F0QBO6", "0752217119", "B000CPHABK", "B0077PBPYQ"]}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51QAS0XRKTL._SY300_.jpg", "asin": "B00004U2K7"}

{"description": "Monte Hellman'sCockfighter, adapted by cult noir writer Charles Willeford from his novel, is a strange bird indeed, an art film for an exploitation audience. Set in the game-fighting pits of the Deep South, it follows a season on the circuit with Frank Mansfield (Warren Oates), a veteran fighter whose hubris has cost him everything and who rebuilds his stable and his reputation while honoring a vow of silence. Costars Harry Dean Stanton and Laurie Bird previously appeared with Oates in Hellman's cult classicTwo-Lane Blacktop. There are also appearances by Millie Perkins, Steve Railsback, Richard B. Schull, and writer Willeford, who acquits himself nicely as a pit judge.Oates's portrayal of a determined, silent obsessive is almost minimalist yet beautifully expressive, accomplished with gestures, smiles, and nods. He's thoughtful and gentle yet dedicated to bloodsport, and his contradictions can be felt in the tension between the comic adventures and gritty stories of Willeford's script, with the meditative intensity of Hellman's often serene direction and cinematographer Nestor Almendros's lovely images of the Deep South's rural beauty.Cockfighterwas one of the few films produced by \"King of the B's\" Roger Corman that lost money, so he added a dream sequence full of nudity, created a trailer with action scenes nowhere to be found in the film, and rereleased the film under the titleBorn to Kill. Needless to say, Anchor Bay has returned to Hellman's original cut, which does contain footage of real and often savage cockfights. Animal lovers and squeamish viewers beware.The accompanying documentaryWarren Oates: Across the Borderis a genial if ultimately lightweight portrait of the actor by friends and fellow performers Ben Johnson, Stacy Keach, Peter Fonda, and hisCockfightercompatriots Harry Dean Stanton, Millie Perkins, and Monte Hellman.The DVD also features commentary by Hellman and production assistant Steven Gaydos, along with moderator Dennis Bartok.--Sean Axmaker", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 324171}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "title": "Cockfighter", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001O2SHJ4", "B0011ZXM12", "B000P0IZZC", "B000WC39FO", "B00005IA7Z", "B009R68H80", "B00J7N2VMQ", "B0009GX1CO", "1905124554", "B009YX8LG4", "1426960247", "B003XTOBU0", "B00ICWO1LC", "B00HT2L7VS", "B00H8J2KYU", "B0051J15ZE", "B0009H97H6", "B0012OX7D0", "B0009PVZD2", "B005IX3C4U", "B00067Z2BO", "B000S0GYRU", "B0004Z33E6", "B00F98FOI6", "B00006L92S", "0984589228", "B00I462XGG", "B00I462XLG", "B000063K2Q", "B009R68HFI", "B005KQVE1S", "B0048O2YWG", "B0009GX1CE", "B00JQYUZSS", "B004IB04NK", "B000MNOXZ8", "B000I8OOG0", "B000MM0LEQ", "B009RWRIMU", "B003L20IME", "B000MM0LF0", "B0074JOWBS", "B00A7OBJKY", "B0000648YY", "B0049M7BHA", "B00BJB2H14", "B00I3C1T34", "B000UJ48VS", "B0077T5SV8", "B000MM0LEG", "B00AZFECS6", "B00I3C1T1Q", "B008220DGE", "B000BGR1B4", "1905124678", "1568582102", "B00004Y6BH", "B00004W5VD", "B000UUX2VO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["1426960247", "0984589228", "1905124554", "B0011ZXM12"]}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51PFF8ZWH3L._SY300_.jpg", "asin": "B00004Y6BF"}
{"description": "If you've seenScreamandI Know What You Did Last Summer, then you know the entire plot ofScary Movie. That's okay, though, because this is a parody, and it helps to know the story in order to be able to get the jokes. No, the biggest surprise here is not the  story as much as the amount of full-frontal male nudity. Really, in addition to all the dick jokes (and the ass jokes and fart jokes), there's a couple of shots of the male member, one of which is erect and used as a weapon.Scary Moviesomehow ended up with an R rating, which in a sense is groundbreaking; perhaps our ratings board is loosening up after all.But is it funny? That's the most important question, and the answer to that is yes. In the vein ofAirplane!, with a dash of the Farrelly brothers,Scary Moviekeeps throwing jokes at you one after another. The law of averages says some of them have to hit, and enough of them do to keep the movie entertaining. Unlike the makers ofAirplane!, however, the Wayans brothers aren't making this movie out of a love of the genre, and unlike the Farrelly brothers, they don't make fun of retarded people with any sort of respect, so the humor throughout feels a lot uglier. Still, there are enough funny scenes inScary Movieto make the viewing experience worthwhile.

{"description": "Buffy Summers (Sarah Michelle Gellar) looks like your typical perky high-schooler, and like most, she has her secret fears and anxieties. However, while most teens are worrying about their next date, their next zit, or their next term paper, Buffy's angsting over the next vampire she has to slay. See, Buffy, a young woman with superhuman strength, is the \"chosen one,\" and she must help rid the world of evil, namely by staking demons. The exceptional first season ofBuffy the Vampire Slayerintroduces us to the treacherous world of Sunnydale High School (where Buffy moved after torching her previous high school's gym). The characters there include \"watcher\" Giles (Anthony Stewart Head) and the original \"Scooby Gang\" members--friendly geek Xander (Nicholas Brendon), computer whiz Willow (Alyson Hannigan), and snobbish popular girl Cordelia (Charisma Carpenter)--who aid Buffy in her quest. Those used to the darker tone thatBuffytook in its later seasons will be surprised by the lighter feeling these first 12 episodes have--it's kind of likeBuffy 90210as the cast grapples with regular teen problems in addition to saving the world from demonic darkness. Fans of the show will enjoy the crisp writing, the phenomenal chemistry of the cast (already well-established within the first few episodes), and the introduction to characters that would stay for many seasons, including moody vampire Angel (David Boreanaz). Through it all, Gellar carries the series with amazing confidence, whether conveying the despair of high school or dispatching various demons--she's one of TV's most distinctive and strongest heroines.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000EHSVL4", "B000EHSVLE", "B000EHSVLY", "B000EHSVM8", "B000EHSVN2", "B000EHSVMS", "B000I0QLQY", "B000I0QLR8", "B000I0QLRI", "B000I0QLRS", "B000I0QLS2", "B0006IUE16", "B000HD1482", "B0009W5J4Q", "B007H9CNOI", "B000B5XOW0", "B003YF9Q08", "B000CCBCGM", "B005CM1IIE", "B000ERVJM2", "B000GG4Y6O", "B000OIOPHC", "1593078226", "B00344EAQO", "B0046XG48O", "B00133QNRW", "B00001R3O1", "B000JLTRIG", "B00466H3CW", "B00006J3WH", "1442412097", "B0000AQS0F", "1595821651", "B002JVWR9U", "B000BOH986", "B000QDLSR0", "B00133QNS6", "B002U8XW9Q", "0789326302", "B00JF5GAZA", "B000FP2OPY", "B00A8KJN8M", "067103541X", "B000FL7CAK", "B00JF5G8WU", "B0024FAR66", "B003IMERF6", "0671042599", "B000W089VU", "B000BW7QWW", "B004SIP9P6", "B009LDCXNY", "B006LG74Q0", "B0001JXPPC", "B00006FD9N", "159307784X", "B002JVWR4A", "159307963X", "B000P0I4P8", "B000BOH98G", "B001M5UDGS", "B002JVWR4U", "B000GG4Y28", "B000RO6JYK", "B00133QNSG", "B000KLQUMG", "0671024337", "B000HT3P60", "B008X6N8KW", "B00005V6BG", "B000NA2BEU", "B000R9YLKY", "B000RW3VDE", "B0058YPGL6", "B000CNE0SS", "B005GP7ELM", "B003L77GH4", "B000AJJNFE", "B0001GF2F6", "B000A5045Q", "B009LDCWWG", "1595825584", "B000LC4ZIA", "B000G1R4RK", "B002BAW6HW", "B00HEQOAIQ", "B001992NWO", "B000X5SPBI", "B000GBEWSO", "B000R7I44K", "B002JVWR54", "B001ILFUA0", "B003L77GAQ", "B00005JLKB", "B000N6TYLW", "B001L1S1OY", "B000EWBNMS", "B00018D42W", "B0043CT976", "B00BBXSPES"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0046XG48O", "B000EHSVLY", "B000EHSVL4", "B000EHSVLE"]}, "price": 1.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 129374}, "asin": "B00005221I", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DJ570H6VL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Buffy The Vampire Slayer - The Complete First Season"}

Jenna promptly abandons her newborn baby with Maggie, who proceeds to raise the child as her own, despite evidence of autism. But as the little girl, Cody, gets older, what seemed to be autism starts to manifest itself in more startling ways. At the same time, a series of child murders are sweeping the city--murders conducted by a mysterious cult with supernatural matters on their mind.Bless the Childstarts promisingly, with subdued, creepy scenes contrasted with more outrageous moments like swarms of computer-generated rats. Fans of religious horror movies will enjoy its twist onThe Omen, with an angelic child instead of a demonic one--only the child is still pretty eerie.

Jimmy Smits (Price of Glory) costars as an FBI cult chaser, and Rufus Sewell (Dark City,Cold Comfort Farm) gives a pleasantly restrained performance as the charismatic cult leader.

{"description": "Lord Peter Wimsey (Ian Carmichael) and his manservant, Bunter (Glyn Houston), take a holiday in Scotland, but instead of spending his time fishing and playing the odd round of golf, Wimsey soon finds himself traipsing through the bracken in pursuit of a killer. It's a thankless task, really, considering that no one in town is sorry the victim is dead; one villager describes him as \"a bitterly unpopular man... with a permanent grudge against everybody.\" Six of the dead man's fellow artists have recently argued with him, and none has a satisfactory alibi. With the invaluable aid of Bunter--who somehow manages to do a considerable amount of sleuthing, win the heart of a local chambermaid, and still prepare a full dinner before his master's return each day--Wimsey must determine which five are red herrings, and which one is guilty. Two of the four one-hour episodes end in cliffhangers (one literally) that are guaranteed to have viewers popping in the next tape as soon as they can slide it out of the box. Carmichael easily slips from charming to cunning as the witty and quick-witted Wimsey; unfortunately, while both the acting and scenery are a pleasure to watch, the solution is ultimately disappointing--an anti-climactic conclusion to an otherwise enjoyable holiday in the world of Dorothy L. Sayers's creation.--Larisa Lomacky Moore", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005NFYK", "B00000INCJ", "B00004W201", "1569383529", "B000062XIG"], "bought_together": ["B00005NFYK", "1569383529"]}, "price": 10.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 464436}, "asin": "B000056C0J", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZCXESE7AL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Lord Peter Wimsey - Five Red Herrings [VHS]"}
{"description": "Chushingurameans \"loyalty,\" and that potent Japanese theme runs like hot blood throughout this stately samurai epic. It's often called theGone with the Windof Japanese cinema, and while that may be a fitting cultural parallel, it gives an inaccurate impression of the film, based on one of Japan's most enduring and oft-interpreted historical events. A simmering, deliberately paced drama set during the Tokugawa shogunate in 1701, it centers on 47 loyal samurai who seek vengeance against the arrogant elder statesman who caused their master's ritual suicide. The now masterlessroninlet seasons pass (and the movie occasionally seems just as long) before executing a climactic raid that is both expertly fierce and lethally efficient. Featuring a who's-who of fine Japanese actors, including Kurosawa regulars Toshiro Mifune and Takashi Shimura,Chushingurabears little resemblance to Kurosawa's action-packed samurai classics. This is a thematically dense, politically complex drama, presented here at its fullest length (207 minutes) and best appreciated after multiple viewings. Masterfully composed with painterly precision,Chushinguraweaves its intricate tapestry from time-honored tenets of Japanese culture, offering a challenging but grandly rewarding experience.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001PCNZJU", "B000AQKUD6", "B006H3KQSK", "B000WEH74G", "B00687XNNK", "B000C6NP7M", "B0007989YS", "B007N5YK10", "B00005JLEJ", "B00K2CHX9C", "B0009WIE2A", "B000PHW2PO", "B004XQO8MS", "B002E01MBA", "B00065GX0K", "B0080WPADW", "B000K0YM0Y", "B000G8NXYG", "B004KDYR7A", "B007N5YJZM", "B000K0YLZ0", "B00005B1ZL", "B0006N0E4S", "B000AQKUGI", "B000067IY6", "B001BEK8E2", "B00073K7KI", "B00687XNQM", "B005D0RDCU", "B000AQKUC2", "B0009IW8CQ", "B00004Y7HL", "B00097DXTO", "B00JK7QWEM", "B004XQO8R8", "B00K5EJHGO", "B0001XAKC4", "B0009ZBVO0", "B000BB14I0", "B000AQKUFO", "B00004W3HF", "B003VE9WRE", "B0038P1D0K", "B00EO2I6OM", "B005D0RDPM", "B00B4FU65Y", "B00009V7OB", "B003152Z4U", "B0028YW3EW", "B004ODLUJO", "B003N2CVQ8", "B00019JR5Y", "B002VRNJDA", "B00B2BYXSQ", "B007K7IBHK", "B0012SY0E6", "B002ZG4Q5W", "B00CEIOHPU", "B000AQKUCW", "B000BQ5J18", "B00B2BYXWM", "B000FS9FIK", "B00CEIOH8C", "B004PN4ZSG", "B008H1Q3NW", "B0030A6ICG", "B000NOK0H6", "B00265T7JM", "B006C1S1DY", "B002AFX52S", "B00005JLMU", "B002CLKP0K", "B00HEPDLFK", "B003KGBISY", "B008VF0Y02", "B004DJ1JYK", "B00JG88XD8", "B00EO2I6W4", "B000ROAPTA", "B00A8QDHYW", "B00E3G1G46", "B00GXGLQOO", "B000FDECGA", "B000VARC3C", "6305339708", "B0090SVDRW", "B006C1S1GQ", "B000MQ550W", "B00B2BYXYA", "B008VR7U66", "B001C0I608", "B00005QCVX", "B00C6WHSRI", "B0006IINIW", "B000OPPAF6", "B008Y5OWO8", "B0026VBOJM", "B000NDFHVQ", "B000063UQU", "B000XPSC0C"], "bought_together": ["B001PCNZJU", "B000WEH74G"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001PCNZJU", "B000WEH74G", "B00HEPDGKA", "B000C6NP7M"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 33481}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 99.99, "brand": "Image Entertainment", "asin": "B000056NWP", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51SJTM56W7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Chushingura"}
{"description": "Got your Area 51 facts straight? Your Kennedy conspiracy in order? Then why not adopt one of the more curious conspiracy theories: man never landed on the moon. Produced in 2001, this 47-minute documentary (which aired on the Fox network) has the \"facts\" to prove Apollo 11 went into space, but never to the moon. While the film starts a bit differently than most conspiracy videos (a Tower of Babel opening, a montage of rocket explosions scored to \"Destination Moon\"), the film soon goes fast and loose with the facts and quickly plays its \"knockout\" evidence. Writer-director-producer Bart Winfield Sibrel's first arguments play on hindsight: Kennedy (mired in conspiracy) set a goal of landing a man on the moon before the end of the decade; Nixon (mired in trickery) was in office to pull it off. When Sibrel examines iffy scientific principals (how deadly are Van Allen radiation belts?) and curious facts (Neil Armstrong's guarded private life--is he hiding something?), it puts just enough doubt in the viewer's mind. The vast array of photographic evidence seems sketchy (shadow irregularities easily explained by exposure settings), confusing (newly discovered shots from inside Apollo 11's capsule), and intriguing (shadow discrepancies). The production quality is not convincing, though, especially the odd way the film ends with a clip from the Zapruder film. The video cover is actually a shot from the Hollywood filmCapricorn One, a much more fun way to tackle your space conspiracy theories.--Doug Thomas", "price": 49.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 597375}, "asin": "B000059MCU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DWST5MN6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "A Funny Thing Happened On The Way To The Moon [VHS]"}
{"description": "It's a good thing Sandra Bullock knows her strengths and weaknesses, because without Bullock as star and producer,Miss Congenialitywould be an insufferable mess as opposed to being a mildly enjoyable trifle that is custom-made for Bullock's established screen persona. Only Bullock's fans could really appreciate this fluff (even then they'll wish its ripe premise had been more intelligently handled), but it's not without some highlights to accompany Bullock's reliable charms. Here she plays clumsy, nerdy FBI agent Gracie Hart, who is given the horrific pseudonym Gracie Lou Freebush (one example of the movie's juvenile tendencies) when assigned to infiltrate a beauty pageant to investigate threats of a terrorist attack.Transforming Bullock from frumpy to stunning is a piece of cake (although she gives pageant coach Michael Caine a run for his money), so the movie's premise is trivial at best. More enjoyable is her character's uncouth disdain for pageant contestants and her mistaken perception that they're all a bunch of bimbos. The movie nicely charts Gracie's realization that her own pageant makeover provides a much-needed ego boost. In addition to Caine's effortless scene-stealing, pageant host William Shatner and organizer Candice Bergen are smart choices for comedic support (Shatner's a perfect Bert Parks wannabe), but the movie desperately needs a credible foundation for its comedy to really pay off. Bullock's bureau boss (Benjamin Bratt) is an unconvincing dimwit, and none of the plotting is as smart as sayBeverly Hills Copin combining procedure with laughs. That leaves Bullock to carry the burden of a comedy that just barely works in her favor.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0009KA2OA", "B00005O5CM", "B00005JM55", "6304765266", "B002K0WBXW", "B00081U7HC", "B00AEFXO8Q", "B00003CXSM", "B00006ZXSL", "B00008NRI7", "B002VECM6S", "B00007E2F5", "B0006GANOQ", "B00AEBB8NS", "B00003CXMP", "B0000524E5", "B00AEFY99O", "B00006FMUW", "B000HEWEE4", "B002NZK5V4", "B000YDBPAM", "B000QQLVPQ", "B00AEBB8R4", "B000CEV3M8", "B002O3Z50G", "B004SEUJK0", "B000J4QW7W", "B00E8RKHWW", "B002O3Z4ZW", "B00AEFYM2S", "B000209KMW", "B00AEFY4CG", "B00006ZXSK", "B0045HCJJ4", "B00447L4KA", "B00AMEZDJW", "B00008WJD6", "B0000897EG", "B000QUU4LY", "B000MQC9H4", "B00AEFXYOA", "B0000DIXDR", "B000XT1P3E", "0800177258", "0783225504", "B000NA1WE0", "6305236569", "B000023VTP", "B000FO0A9W", "B002SYAGNC", "B001ECDVK4", "B00003CXFV", "B00AEFYF2K", "B000J103OI", "B00005JG6N", "B0036TGSIK", "B00466HN7M", "B00000G3PA", "B0000AOV4I", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00AEFY5TI", "B0015I2RT8", "B001ECDVJU", "B004SIP8JI", "B00005KAQP", "B000ELJAEM", "B0049TC88U", "B002NZK5UU", "B00006ZXSQ", "B00008G8M4", "B004SIP9RO", "6305212112", "B000A343RI", "B004SIP9X8", "0783225733", "6302077818", "B002GHHHP6", "B002GIBVWA", "B00AEBB9WI", "0800141806", "B000683VI4", "B00795C5X4", "B002NZK5RS", "B00003CXTA", "B000JYW5BE", "B00005JM9Q", "B004EPZ070", "B00AEFXZJE", "B003L20IHE", "B007L6VMDK", "B0038N9X3Q", "B00386EZKE", "B000CCBCAI", "B00007BKVC", "0783235070", "B00AEFXWXI", "B000CEV3KU", "B00005BCKF", "B00AEBB8YW", "B0006N2EZ0"], "bought_together": ["B00005O5CM"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000NA1WE0", "B003PIUIJC", "6304765266", "B00005O5CM"]}, "price": 9.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 77252}, "asin": "B00005AAA9", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514V9KPFJRL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Miss Congeniality"}

{"description": "Heavy on atmosphere and light on everything else,From Hellis visually impressive while lacking the depth of the acclaimed graphic novel it's based upon. Making their third feature since 1993'sMenace II Society, twins Allen and Albert Hughes approach the Jack the Ripper case with physical precision, re-creating the gritty Whitechapel district of 1888 London in meticulous detail. What they've forgotten is the sheer terror that gripped Whitechapel in the wake of the Ripper's slaying of five prostitutes, investigated here by a Scotland Yard sleuth (Johnny Depp) who uses opium, laudanum, and absinthe to fuel his semiprescient visions of the slayings. Heather Graham attempts a slippery Cockney accent as a would-be victim, while Ian Holm steals the show as a has-been surgeon with devilish delusions of grandeur. Violence is obliquely suggested or briefly graphic, but no matter how you cut it,From Hellis only marginally thrilling as it treads familiar territory.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEBBA72", "B000NQRR1Q", "B004P7CNC2", "B00005R87R", "B000F7CECK", "B00AEBBAEK", "B00000IRE6", "B002QEHPQU", "B0002234LS", "B008QE9XD2", "B0000VD04M", "B0009UZG0K", "0780621611", "B006ISJQ1W", "B004SIP7PS", "B0000AC8LI", "B00347AIOE", "B00003CXWV", "B003HKN52U", "B001HN69AY", "B000053VAZ", "B000TGJ80S", "B0012Q7M02", "B00AEBB9F0", "B002Q3MYA8", "B00C888MJ8", "B00004XPPB", "B000FDEV3Y", "0780628551", "0783229526", "B001HN694K", "B0000WN140", "B0009IOR6Q", "B00F84H73Q", "B00003CXRG", "B001GCUO0W", "B004A8ZWSS", "B004SIP6BI", "B00004W4UB", "B000N2HDJQ", "B000C3L27U", "B000GCFO0I", "B000BB1MI2", "B005S9EJ8W", "B0009XRZKQ", "B00AEBB89W", "B008R65Y28", "B001I04QCO", "B00008LUNW", "B00005JLKN", "B003Y5H54W", "B0012QE4Q2", "B00DZP1C2W", "B00AEBB8NI", "B00JPFTX5O", "B0000TPA0G", "B001AGXEAG", "B0041KKYEM", "B00J5JSV3A", "B000069I1I", "B002UOMH00", "B004SIP92O", "B001A50716", "B005LAIHYU", "B0002KVUKM", "B005COPWZW", "B0036BDQ7Y", "B000UJ48P4", "B004SIP7TE", "B0031U8OEK", "0783116934", "B005LAIHXQ", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B000063US5", "B00005JLQN", "B00DHD933W", "B002AF4Y9G", "B000LP6KNU", "B008JFUNYG", "B0021L8V34", "B001D2WU9I", "B007XF0W3K", "B003AWRMBU", "B00009MEKN", "B00HRCATDW", "B0020PFYHC", "B00003CXKM", "B004SUDQ4A", "B0010DR4BO", "B0097C046W", "B00IKM5LXG", "B000FAOC2W", "B004SIP9Z6", "B00K6D1RVW", "B002ZG97CO", "B00151QYXU", "B005LAIH2C", "6301971345", "6304712499", "B003H5WF3U"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AEBBA72", "B004P7CNC2", "B00005R87R", "B000NQRR1Q"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 164982}, "asin": "B00005JKJM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/418JG1F78JL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "From Hell (Two-Disc Special Edition)"}
{"description": "Antoine Fuqua (THE REPLACEMENT KILLERS, BAIT) turns up the intensity level with TRAINING DAY, a charged drama about police corruption in downtown Los Angeles. Ethan Hawke stars as Jake Hoyt, a well-intentioned young officer who thinks he's found his ticket to becoming a detective in the form of undercover officer Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington). Harris is a notorious figure in the streets and in the office. He also has the authority to make Jake's professional wishes come true, provided Jake is able to prove his worth on Alonzo's team. At first, Alonzo's blunt, carefree demeanor provides a shock to Jake's optimistic system, but as it becomes clear that Alonzo is dangerously out of control, Jake must decide whether or not to risk his future in the name of the law.\n\nWashington's performance as the evil, pragmatic detective is a sight to behold. He delivers his lines with a devilish ferocity that keeps the film bubbling throughout. Hawke slips into the role of the rookie everyman with ease, providing a good contrast to Washington's fiery presence. Former video director Fuqua completes the picture by casting musicians Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre, and Macy Gray in supporting roles.", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792841778", "630268644X", "6303012140", "6300214826"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 428216}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.0, "brand": "", "asin": "B00005JKEC", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/415AYTB1GNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Training Day [VHS]"}
{"description": "Director Frank Darabont created this Frank Capra-inspired drama based on a screenplay by his friend and one-time schoolmate Michael Sloane. Jim Carrey stars as Pete Appleton, a screenwriter in the Hollywood of the 1950s. Pete's on top of the world with his first motion picture \"Sand Pirates of the Sahara\" just released to theaters and his romance with a beautiful starlet (Amanda Detmer) heating up. However, his triumph turns to dismay when he's called before the commie-hunting House Un-American Activities Committee and advised by a studio lawyer and his agent to play ball with the witch hunters. Depressed by the film industry's weak-kneed reaction to the hearings, Pete gets drunk and drives his car north along the California coast, where he crashes from a bridge and wakes up on shore the next morning suffering from amnesia. Wandering into the nearby small town of Lawson, Pete is mistaken for Luke Trimble, a lost hero of World War II who, like most of the area's young men, never returned from the war a decade earlier. \"Luke\" has soon reunited with both his father (Martin Landau) and his one-time girlfriend (Laurie Holden), and finds that his reappearance has given the citizens of Lawson an emotional boost that's sorely needed. When he refurbishes and reopens his family's decrepit movie theater, the Majestic, Luke revitalizes Lawson just as his memory of his true identity begins to reassert itself. Sloane's original script for The Majestic (2001) was entitled The Bijou.", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 298103}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.75, "brand": "", "asin": "B00005JKNB", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GZ710HSNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Majestic [VHS]"}

{"description": "The classic science fiction novel by H.G. Wells becomes this big-budget adventure directed by the author's great-grandson Simon Wells. Guy Pearce stars as Alexander Hartdegen, a scientist, professor, and inventor in 1895 New York City who believes that time travel is possible. The sudden and unexpected death of his fianc&#x82;e spurs Alexander to build a time machine, which he hopes to use in an effort to change the past. When he is unable to change the past, Alexander hurls himself more than 800,000 years into the future, seeking answers about the nature of time, but instead encountering a dystopian world where humanity has divided up into two races, the peaceful Eloi and the subterranean Morlocks. Befriending the beautiful Eloi woman Mara (pop singer Samantha Mumba), Alexander must set out to save her from the underground world of the Morlocks when she is captured by them. Along the way, he is aided by Vox (Orlando Jones), a bio-mechanical being from the 21st century. Ultimately, Alexander makes a shocking discovery about the true nature of the Eloi and Morlocks and decides that the only way to change the future is to alter the present.

{"description": "WithThe Return of the King, the greatest fantasy epic in film history draws to a grand and glorious conclusion. Director Peter Jackson's awe-inspiring adaptation of the Tolkien classicThe Lord of the Ringscould never fully satisfy those who remain exclusively loyal to Tolkien's expansive literature, but as a showcase for physical and technical craftsmanship it is unsurpassed in pure scale and ambition, setting milestone after cinematic milestone as the brave yet charmingly innocent Hobbit Frodo (Elijah Wood) continues his mission to Mordor, where he is destined to destroy the soul-corrupting One Ring of Power in the molten lava of Mount Doom. While the heir to the kingdom of Men, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), endures the massive battle at Minas Tirith with the allegiance of the elf Legolas (Orlando Bloom), dwarf Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) and the great wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen), Frodo and stalwart companion Samwise Gamgee (Sean Astin) must survive the schizoid deceptions of Gollum, who remains utterly convincing as a hybrid of performance (by Andy Serkis) and subtly nuanced computer animation.Jackson and cowriters Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens have much ground to cover; that they do so with intense pacing and epic sweep is impressive enough, but by investing greater depth and consequence in the actions of fellow Hobbits Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd), they ensure thatReturn of the Kingmaintains the trilogy's emphasis on intimate fellowship. While several major characters appear only briefly, and one (Christopher Lee's evil wizard, Saruman) relegated entirely to the extended version on DVD, Jackson is to be commended for his editorial acumen; like Legolas the archer, his aim as a filmmaker is consistently true, and he remains faithful to Tolkien's overall vision. IfReturnsuffers from too many endings, as some critic suggested, it's only because the epic's conclusion is so loyally inclusive of the actors--most notably Astin--who gave it such strength to begin with. By ending theLOTRtrilogy with noble integrity and faith in the power of imaginative storytelling,The Return of the King, like its predecessors, will stand as an adventure for the ages.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JKZV", "B00003CWT6", "B00BEZTMFY", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B002ZG980U", "B002PMV9FG", "B008UZA8FY", "B001NGML48", "B00005JM5E", "B001GZ6QC4", "B005COPWZW", "B008M4C1EO", "B00HFFE8HE", "039548930X", "B000W7F5SS", "B000I0RQVI", "B002VWNIDG", "B000E6EK2Y", "B001BYMX4A", "B004M1A21K", "B007K3JFUQ", "B001DHXT20", "B001UV4XHY", "0345325818", "B003Y5H54W", "B00005JNJV", "B00E5I2M6I", "B000A3XY5A", "B004LWZWGA", "B000U7WV1Y", "B005LXQLRW", "B001OQCV6A", "B000E8M0VA", "B004SIP8ZM", "B000EHRVMY", "0618640150", "B003ZK99NQ", "B0013FDM7E", "B00005JPH2", "B000UNYK4E", "B009JBWOU0", "B00003CX5P", "B00008G8M5", "B00GKOJ98E", "B004LWZW42", "B000H30B2C", "B000P0J0C4", "B00CZDLGDU", "B000M341QE", "B00008G8M4", "B000FKO5QK", "B00HWWUQYY", "B007SPPANM", "B008JFUO72", "B001DJLD1M", "0345538374", "B00AEFY5B6", "B00005JKCH", "B004SIP9U6", "B000YGGNMO", "B00E5I2M9K", "0618126988", "B005OCFGTO", "B00E8S2JZ4", "6305313687", "B004AKCME8", "B0002KVUKM", "B000AARKOO", "B0006GAO5Y", "B000K7VHQ4", "B002ZG997C", "B00AHTYI5M", "B008JFUS0U", "B0042MEQVG", "B00275EGWY", "B00E9PMML2", "B008UZDXEW", "B004SIP7F8", "B00116GEJS", "B00003CXI1", "B003ZKBELG", "B003Y5H5EW", "B000V4UFZK", "B0007PLLBU", "B001DTPZNY", "B002O3Z50Q", "B001GCUO1Q", "B000LP6KNU", "B005G4TJUC", "B00AW0KHTM", "B002ZG97YM", "054792819X", "B00AEFXZJE", "B0000YEEGM", "B002IPFWTE", "B001ECQ75A", "B000065U1N", "B0051MKNV8", "B000W796OM", "B00J49R1BY"], "bought_together": ["B00005JKZV", "B00003CWT6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00HFFE8HE", "B00003CWT6", "B00005JKZV", "B00BEZTMFY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 1589}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.49, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00005JKZY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HS7iSFv5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)"}

But once Corky goes undercover, his klutzy ways accidentally make him the star of the FBI, sparking envy from his fellow agents and arousing suspicion in the mob. Though the script ofCorky Romanodeclines as the movie goes on, Kattan actually keeps the picture going; his spastic, sniveling, childish energy is engaging, and at its best the production bubbles over with silliness. It only falls flat when Kattan has to behave in a remotely adult manner, which fortunately doesn't happen very often. Cheerful dopiness.

{"description": "A Beautiful Mindmanages to twist enough pathos out of John Nash's incredible life story to redeem an at-times goofy portrayal of schizophrenia. Russell Crowe tackles the role with characteristic fervor, playing the Nobel prize-winning mathematician from his days at Princeton, where he developed a groundbreaking economic theory, to his meteoric rise to the cover ofForbesmagazine and an MIT professorship, and on through to his eventual dismissal due to schizophrenic delusions. Of course, it is the delusions that fascinate director Ron Howard and, predictably, go astray. Nash's other world, populated as it is by a maniacal Department of Defense agent (Ed Harris), an imagined college roommate who seems straight out ofDead Poets Society, and an orphaned girl, is so fluid and scriptlike as to make the viewer wonder if schizophrenia is really as slick as depicted. Crowe's physical intensity drags us along as he works admirably to carry the film on his considerable shoulders. No doubt the story of Nash's amazing will to recover his life without the aid of medication is a worthy one, his eventual triumph heartening.

{"description": "Margaret Cho is an NC-17 woman in a PG-13 world. Very, very little can be quoted from this concert film, as can be expected from a woman who, in the film's empowering conclusion, sounds the rallying cry to live \"without restraint.\" Leave it to Cho to reference September 11 with a joke that is at once profane and respectful. Like Richard Pryor, the Korean-American outlaw comedian has found her niche with concert films that allow her the freedom to be her \"actual self.\" She riffs unabashedly about relationships gone sour and relates her experiences as a sexual Captain Kirk, boldly going where she has never gone before. Notorious, yes, but not as accessible for the uninitiated as her last concert film,I'm the One That I Want, which recounted the rise and fall of her ill-fated sitcom.

{"description": "There's only one deleted scene in this two-disc DVD set, but it's a doozy. The \"Sgt. Candy Scene\" is a must-see and, unfortunately, the best thing on the second disc. The rushed HBO documentary shows us far more flash than substance. Better is the Visual Effects Lab that goes more in-depth with four sequences, although you need to wade through a hokey interface for each segment. Making your \"own\" effects isn't that much fun; you can only choose a few effects that change in two scenes. Anyone looking to get the complicated backstory of the trilogy figured out should dig into the \"Sky Net Database\" and an intricate timeline. The two commentary tracks are worth a listen, with director Jonathan Mostow's solo track the better one. The director goes into great detail on how the little things (from lighting street scenes to tricks for destroying buildings) count.  The second track is pieced together from the actors recorded separately. Mostow appears with actress Claire Danes (doing her first commentary track) and their chemistry is enjoyable after a slow start.

{"description": "TheDaredeviltwo-DVD set has plenty to please both film and comic fans. The best feature is an hourlong collection of interviews of people who worked on the comic book, from Stan Lee to Frank Miller to Kevin Smith.  (Yes, sharp-eyed fans: the Elektra-Bullseye showdown was closely based onDaredevil#181.)  On the film side, director-screenwriter Mark Steven Johnson and producer Gary Foster's commentary track provides background info and some fawning over Jennifer Garner, a text commentary provides more trivia and inside jokes, and an enhanced viewing mode offers production-design featurettes. Most prominently among a bunch of other features, another hourlong documentary goes behind the shooting of the film, and Garner tries to keep a straight face during her screen test.

{"description": "There's something in this house...Something ancient and dark that remains still, hidden and silent. It can only wait, having been concealed in the shadows for years. In fact, its milieu is darkness. Only in it can it show itself and move. It even takes its name: DARKNESS. It's lived here since someone tried to call it, more than forty years ago. Because this house hides a secret, a terrible past, an inconceivably evil act. Seven children, faceless people, a circle that must be completed. And blood, lots of blood... But something went wrong. One of the children got away. The circle wasn't completed. That's why what lives here isn't finished. It's just waiting...It tries to carry out what it couldn't before, making plans in the shadows, to become complete, to be, to exist. A new family has just moved into the house. A small child. An unstable father capable of losing his temper at any time. A perfect target. The right place at the right time. The pieces only have to be put in place. And then wait. Maybe the family's daughter will be able to discover the truth; the dark secret of the past, the sinister conspiracy, the truth about what threatens them. Why is the father getting worse? What is her little brother afraid of? Why doesn't her mother listen to her? And why do the lights keep going out? It could be that nothing happens by chance, that everything has been worked out from the start. A devilish plan, precise and exact like a time-bomb. Her father's illness, the house, the circles, the children. Perhaps she can foresee darkness' master stroke of play and the inevitable destiny that is closing in on her family. But maybe it's too late....", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0013FZUP6", "B00EZ50SGW", "0783237413", "B00015HX5O", "B00008LUNW", "B00BEIYG98", "B004P7CN3G", "B001U0HBQA", "B000ECXWW2", "B00AJLHUA8", "B00BEIYMAG", "B00000K31T", "B00IKM5LXG", "B000OVLBGM", "B0021L8UFI", "B00005JOWW", "B004SUDQ4A", "B006QWC2ZC", "B00B96TGQS", "B00441GYTC", "B00003CWRF", "B0002H3S78", "B0006SGYL0", "B000TXNDT8", "B000HC2LFI", "B0010X740A", "B001NFNFNU", "B00DPUB5EW", "B008VPCL7G", "B0031U8OEK", "B00005UM2X", "B00AEFYCW8", "B002ZG98LO", "B002GHHHL0", "B003VA3JUO", "B00AIBZLVY", "B00AEFYSR2", "B000AWYOGE", "B004SUDQ04", "6305428271", "B000NQRR1Q", "B0097C046W", "B00005JMET", "B001KKU9CI", "B000PMLJMQ", "B004LWZW24", "B007CZ3E7C", "B003LR5BDK", "B003AWRMC4", "B003Y5H54W", "1573625779", "B003IWYWC4", "B000RGN2JI", "B000OCY7TY", "B001UV4X8S", "B0006SSOHC", "B002ZG971U", "B009XTF8KQ", "B00003CXWM", "B0067QPVJ6", "B005TK23PQ", "B0009X763M", "B000FFJZO2", "B004EPYZT4", "B0000AUHOK", "B003Y5H4SO", "B0002C4JJ4", "B000069I1I", "B00005UQ9W", "B000GCFO0I", "B005LAIGOQ", "B002LMSWN2", "B005LAIIRQ", "B004SIP95G", "B001QOGYAO", "B008JFUNYG", "B00003CWOL", "B00005JL3T", "B000ASATZ8", "B000ION22G", "6305908087", "B000ARTMT8"], "bought_together": ["B0013FZUP6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B008D1RCZY", "B004P7CN7W", "B007AFC236", "B000AA4JL6"]}, "price": 15.47, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 95491}, "asin": "B00005JNBN", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41C8GH93EFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Darkness (Unrated Version)"}

{"description": "Batman Beginsdiscards the previous four films in the series and recasts the Caped Crusader as a fearsome avenging angel. That's good news, because the series, which had gotten off to a rousing start under Tim Burton, had gradually dissolved into self-parody by 1997'sBatman & Robin. As the title implies,Batman Beginstells the story anew, when Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) flees Western civilization following the murder of his parents. He is taken in by a mysterious instructor named Ducard (Liam Neeson in another mentor role) and urged to become a ninja in the League of Shadows, but he instead returns to his native Gotham City resolved to end the mob rule that is strangling it. But are there forces even more sinister at hand?Cowritten by the team of David S. Goyer (a veteran comic book writer) and director Christopher Nolan (Memento),Batman Beginsis a welcome return to the grim and gritty version of the Dark Knight, owing a great debt to the graphic novels that preceded it. It doesn't have the razzle dazzle, or the mass appeal, ofSpider-Man 2(though the Batmobile is cool), and retelling the origin means it starts slowly, like most \"first\" superhero movies. But it's certainly the best Bat-film since Burton's original, and one of the best superhero movies of its time. Bale cuts a good figure as Batman, intense and dangerous but with some of the lightheartedness Michael Keaton brought to the character. Michael Caine provides much of the film's humor as the family butler, Alfred, and as the love interest, Katie Holmes (Dawson's Creek) is surprisingly believable in her first adult role. Also featuring Gary Oldman as the young police officer Jim Gordon, Morgan Freeman as a Q-like gadgets expert, and Cillian Murphy as the vile Jonathan Crane.--David HoriuchiBatmanat Amazon.comAllBatmanDVDsBatman Begins101: A Comic Book PrimerWhere Have I Seen Christian Bale?AllBatmanComics and Graphic NovelsBatmanToysBatman BeginsSoundtrackStills fromBatman Begins(click for larger images)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001GZ6QC4", "B004LWZWGA", "B002GSXKN8", "B000P0J06U", "B001OST0LW", "B000P0J06K", "B004EPZ07K", "B00E5I2MCM", "B00005JKCH", "B001GCUO1Q", "B002ZG980U", "B001OST0M6", "B008JFUPFI", "B004LWZWFQ", "B00005JMQW", "B004LWZW42", "B000VI70QS", "B001DHXT20", "B000M341QE", "B0000959N0", "B000UR9T8C", "B00005JNTU", "B000AYELVA", "B00E5I2M6I", "B002IPFWTE", "B000HEVZ9E", "B0090SI56Y", "B002HWRYJE", "B0006L0LOS", "B000OVLBF8", "B00003CWT6", "B000VR0570", "B00E5I2MEK", "B000HCO83Q", "B0007P0Y7C", "B008JFUO72", "B00F4FFO8E", "B001CDR1FG", "B000P0J0EW", "B002T9H2LA", "B0002KVUKM", "B00E5I2M9K", "B00005N5S5", "B0083SBMBM", "B0001BKAEY", "B00AQSN7HE", "B000J10EQU", "B00005JKZY", "B002NXSRVG", "B000AYELVU", "B001OQCV6A", "B004LWZW4M", "B001VLBDD0", "B001GZ6QEC", "B004GJYRA0", "B007REV4T8", "B001TK80C0", "B000HRJLII", "B001QTXM5Y", "B005G4TJUC", "B00005JKZV", "B0053FANT0", "B00005JA8B", "B003YAR97K", "B004SIP9Z6", "B00001ZWUS", "B004EPYZQC", "B001N44BVQ", "B006VRRGNK", "B001AEF6HM", "B00000JQB5", "B00011CZRE", "B00AZMFJYA", "B00AEFY0F2", "B007K3JFUQ", "B0002IQMAM", "B00005JN0T", "B002SJIO4A", "B000VWYJ86", "B0013FDM7E", "B00005JNTI", "B00407PNY2", "B00DTPRZ24", "B008JFUS0U", "B00004Z4WR", "B000FS9FCG", "B000QXDED6", "B0085A9HU6", "0780624890", "B00005LOUK", "B000065U1N", "B000P0J0AG", "B00005JN5T", "B001QB9H1U", "B00005JMUA", "0792844890", "B0007DFJ0G", "B004EPYZSK", "B008JFUOWM", "B00AEFY5B6"], "bought_together": ["B001GZ6QC4", "B004LWZWGA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B009JBWOU0", "B001GZ6QC4", "B004LWZWGA", "B002ZG980U"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 7806}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.99, "brand": "DC Comics", "asin": "B00005JNJV", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518zjc4XtzL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Batman Begins (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "In the DVD world, the Criterion Collection label generally indicates that you'll be getting your money's worth on the extras, andThe Life Aquatic with Steve Zissouis no exception. These two discs contain many features that fans of the film will expect: Seu Jorge performing David Bowie songs (complete versions), many documentary scenes of writer-director Wes Anderson at work, interviews with cast members including Cate Blanchett, Bill Murray, etc. Other extras are a little more confusing. For instance, does Seymour Cassel, who plays Zissou's deceased partner, know what he's doing when he complains to a hairless cigar merchant about having to go faux bald? And what's the deal withMondo Monda? It's a cringingly awkward Italian talk show in which the host (also an actor in the film) interviews the screenwriters, throwing out references so random and esoteric that even smart guys like Anderson and Noah Baumbach are left speechless. It's all a joke, right? In the end, the bonus material accomplishes its primary goal: get those who already enjoy the film to like it just a little bit more.--Leah Weathersby", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0010X8NF0", "6305428239", "B0000640VJ", "0767821408", "B007L6VR12", "B001QOGYBI", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B007L6VR6M", "B000CS464G", "B0006TPE4C", "081099741X", "B00005JMJ4", "B000934FC2", "B0035G5IOE", "B00JAQJNN0", "B00005JMJG", "B000BRD6T4", "B0045NXMJE", "B00007AJF8", "B00H9HZITU", "B0018BD9DA", "B004SEUIXS", "1623160510", "B001P3SA8K", "B000JMK6LW", "B0018O4YT0", "B001MM3AZM", "B0006H32EI", "B002E2M5IC", "B0012E2GFK", "B000M4RG7E", "B0007DFJ0G", "B000Y7U98C", "B001NPD9PY", "B00IJXJAIS", "B000A7DVR2", "B008MIMWP8", "B004FQX5B6", "B00GKOJ98E", "0783228457", "B000K7VHOG", "B002LMV7RA", "B00008RH3J", "B0009A40ES", "B00DL46ZN8", "0957490909", "B000F5GNX8", "B00005JLRE", "B00006AUIH", "B00005V9HH", "B00GMV8L1Q", "B001JIE7JM", "B000IU37SO", "B004RQDQIQ", "B00AEBB8SS", "B00006LPGP", "B00000K3TS", "B00H9L28OO", "B007D5E7C2", "B000065AI3", "B0033WH6MW", "B008220D5K", "B0014D5RBE", "B001BPJJ9G", "B00005JL78", "B007D0FVRM", "B00AEFYOJE", "B00003CXZ4", "6304493681", "B0083V2W4U", "B000Z8GZYW", "B008R65XNS", "0783229526", "B00HGGUTPW", "B003UESJMO", "B005HK13SG", "B000P0J0EW", "B002VWNIAY", "B000P0J0D8", "B004SIP7ZS", "B001HN69AY", "B003XURDAY", "B00H7KJRVY", "B00ECR7KX2", "B001GMAVGE", "B005LAIIJY", "B000055Y0X", "B0000AC8LR", "B000K7VHQE", "B00AEFYAMA", "6305922756", "B0041T52S6", "B009YQJ322", "B003CRM6PA", "B002T9H2LA", "B000O76ZQC", "B0040QYROA", "B005MYEQ4U", "B00I6JOD2S", "B00FZ4KR4U"], "bought_together": ["B0010X8NF0", "B0000640VJ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00JAQJMJ0", "B0010X8NF0", "B007L6VR12", "B0000640VJ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 72305}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.5, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B00005JNLQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51H5Q2VBE1L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou (The Criterion Collection)"}
{"description": "Literary adaptations just don't get any better than director Joe Wright's 2005 version of Jane Austen'sPride & Prejudice. The key word here isadaptation, because Wright and gifted screenwriter Deborah Moggach have taken liberties with Austen's classic novel that purists may find objectionable, but in this exquisite film their artistic decisions are entirely justified and exceptionally well executed. It's a more rural England that we see here, circa 1790 (as opposed to Austen's early 19th century), in which Elizabeth Bennet (Keira Knightley) is one of several sisters primed for marriage, with an anxious mother (Brenda Blethyn) only too desperate to see her daughters paired off with the finest, richest husbands available. Elizabeth is strong-willed and opinionated, but her head (not to mention her pride and prejudice) lead her heart astray when she meets the wealthy Mr. Darcy (Matthew Macfadyen), whose own sense of decency and discretion (not to mentionhispride and prejudice) prevent him from expressing his mutual affection. They're clearly meant for each other, and as Knightley's performance lights up the screen (still young enough to be girlishly impertinent, yet wise beyond her 20 years), Austen's timeless romance yields yet another timeless adaptation, easily on par with the belovedBBC miniseriesthat has been embraced by millions since originally broadcast in 1995. Individual tastes will vary as to which version should be considered \"definitive,\" but with a stellar supporting cast including Judi Dench and Donald Sutherland, this impeccable production achieves its own kind of perfection.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_viewed": ["0800141660", "B00003JRCQ", "B00G6HO368", "B004SIP7AS", "B004P7CNZO", "B0053Q9DHW", "B000244FDW", "B000GRUQKQ", "B000244FFU", "B0018YCF50", "B001L57ZZG", "B004XVMCMQ", "B00AF82WTO", "B008D1RCHC", "B000Z27HLS", "B000BEZQ0Y", "0767851013", "0486284735", "B0002ZH5PQ", "B0012Q3T6I", "6303921248", "B002XTBE6K", "B001PJRAUS", "B00HYMBAQ0", "B0080QOL1A", "B00062IZ0Y", "B001C4AFOY", "B0012XIGVE", "B002KHNFFS", "B000244FF0", "B0012OVCE6", "B00HYMASS6", "B0009UZGAA", "B000784WMW", "0767020308", "B000LPQ6DE", "B001TJYFRU", "B000FTCEYQ", "B000ZS8GW6", "B005GRF2UK", "B004FM2EL2", "B00G7QPXAI", "149440477X", "B009ERK0SW", "B00006ZXSK", "B0000AUHPK", "B004UOHNCA", "0767020294", "B00094AS9U", "B000Z27HMW", "B002DY9KR0", "B000N4SHOE", "B000683VI4", "193799418X"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00G6HO368", "0800141660", "B00003JRCQ", "B005S9EK5Y"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "asin": "B00005JOHI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZGC68T2JL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Pride &amp; Prejudice"}

{"description": "The supercharged possibilities of a single set and two amped-up actors are explored inHard Candy, a twisted cocktail with a poison kicker. After a flirtatious encounter in an online chat room, two people agree to meet for coffee:  a 32-year-old man (Patrick Wilson) and a 14-year-old girl (Ellen Page). They quickly advance to his house, and just as quickly, the apparent pedophilic seduction morphs into something else entirely. After the tables turn,Hard Candybecomes a tale of revenge and torture that might have tempted a filmmaker like Park Chanwook. Here, first-time feature director David Slade opts for a slick look that stays close to the actors, and you can't really blame him--this movie is like a conceptual, more-than-slightly unbelievable off-Broadway play, a showcase for actors and \"controversial\" ideas. Those actors are strong:  Patrick Wilson (Angels in America,Phantom of the Opera) is every bit as creepy as he needs to be, and Ellen Page has nothing short of a triumph. The Canadian actress was around 18 when she shot the film, but looks like an adolescent, which makes her authoritative wrath all the more shocking to witness.

{"description": "Jennifer Garner's lips grow more Angelina-esque every year. In the romantic comedyCatch and Release, Garner (Alias, 13 Going On 30) plays Gray Wheeler, a young woman whose fiance dies unexpectedly before the wedding, leaving Gray unable to afford her home--so she moves in with her fiance's best friends, Sam (Kevin Smith, director ofClerksandDogma) and Dennis (Sam Jaeger,Lucky Number Slevin). But the presence of another old friend named Fritz (Timothy Olyphant,Deadwood) leads to the unveiling of a secret: Gray's fiance had a child with another woman.Catch and Releaselacks the clear story structure that most romantic comedies are built on, but trades it for a richer sense of the ambiguities of human relationships. Garner, though lovely and personable, is a bit bland--fortunately, she's surrounded by actors with all kinds of edges, including Smith (who shows an unexpected and uncloying earnest side), Fiona Shaw (from theHarry Pottermovies) as the fiance's grieving mother, and Juliette Lewis (Cape Fear), who demonstrates once again her powers as a fearless and surprising actress.Catch and Releaseis an uneven movie, with a remarkably elegant visual style that sometimes clashes with the workmanlike dialogue, but it can't be written off as the same old Hollywood claptrap. Though a happy ending is inevitable, the path it takes has some surprising turns and flashes of unexpected emotional depth.--Bret FetzerStills fromCatch and Release(click for larger image)BeyondCatch and Releaseon Amazon.comMore Films from Jennifer GarnerCD SoundtrackMore Romantic Comedies", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0038N9X3Q", "B002UJIY7A", "B000K2V7E6", "B000MQC9H4", "B00K2CHSS8", "B004SIP9RO", "B000N6U0E2", "B00316DDUO", "B004EPZ070", "B0012RLX88", "B003L20IG0", "B002ZG988M", "B002ZG989G", "B0009OL7Z4", "B000LPR5CA", "B001OQCUZM", "B00164KYV4", "B0000560PU", "B003B3V0N4", "B00KNALRZ4", "B00866JL96", "B004EPYZP8", "B00JA3RVG4", "B00005PJ7G", "B003Y5H574", "B0021L8UXA", "6304765266", "B00H9LHVHI", "B00AKGG6JS", "B00005JPSM", "B000P0J08S", "B004LWZW9C", "B003EYVXXC", "B002K0WBXW", "B002ZG99UE", "B00H7LJ2UO", "B00AEFYQE2", "B00K2CHUWW", "B004SBQAN8", "B000ZS8GW6", "B000HEWEE4", "B002P413IC", "B00006ZXSO", "B00AEFY99O", "B000EMGJ7C", "B005LAIGSM", "B003BV8ICC", "B000YABYLA", "B004SIP8JI", "B000YAA68C", "B00007E2F5", "B0038N9WKU", "B001HN69C2", "B00E8RKHWW", "B00FZ4KR4U", "B004EPZ0BG", "B005LAIGRS", "B00005JN3W", "B0021L8V3Y", "B00GUO2SKA", "B000CEV3KU", "B0000VD02Y", "B00008G7UF", "B00HLTD3ZW", "B00IVLRA62", "B000023VTP", "0767810856", "B0004Z3242", "B0009UZGIM", "B00C1LIYWM", "B005LAIGXW", "B001WAKOW6", "B00118T632", "B00B5J6A7W", "B008JFUNKU", "B005LAIIKS", "B004IK30PA", "B0006A9FIM", "B004SIP8LG", "B0038M2APA", "B004BFTFBU", "B00J11U54K", "B002ZG9968", "B00005JNP4", "B00AIBZMD6", "B00006ZXSN", "B0007P0Y7C", "B0021L8UO4", "B0038RSJB4", "B00GEKO51U", "B00AEBB8NS", "B00F8PTALC", "B000683VI4", "B00008NRI7", "B002OVED88", "B0007IO6NM", "B0045HCJJ4", "B000J3OTSM", "B000E6EHE0", "B00IGBI052"], "bought_together": ["B0038N9X3Q"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003L20IG0", "B004EPYZP8", "B00GPWEPZ8", "B002UJIY7A"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 20294}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.98, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B00005JPF3", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51%2B7mjxLmdL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Catch and Release"}
{"description": "The fact-based mystery ofHollywoodlandtakes place in 1959, when the death ofAdventures of SupermanTV star George Reeves cast a pall over the waning days of golden-age Hollywood. As written by Paul Bernbaum, this intriguing whodunit effectively evokes the tainted atmosphere that surrounded Reeves' death (officially ruled a suicide but never conclusively solved), and speculates on circumstances to suggest that Reeves may have been murdered. In combining the melancholy course of Reeves' career with the investigation of a down-and-out private detective into the possible causes of Reeves' death, the film evolves into an engrossing study of parallels between lives on either side of the Hollywood dream. Building upon a distinguished career in TV including episodes of HBO'sThe Sopranos,RomeandSix Feet Under, director Allen Coulter finds a satisfying balance between the tragic overtones of the Reeves case and the time-honored elements of the gumshoe genre, with Adrien Brody doing fine work as private eye Louis Simo, a fictional composite character who is our conduit to the desperate yearnings of Reeves' final months.In a critically acclaimed performance, Ben Affleck plays Reeves in moody flashbacks, caught betweenSupermanstardom and financial dependence on his lover Toni Mannix (Diane Lane), the somewhat predatory wife of Hollywood \"fixer\" and MGM honcho Eddie Mannix (Bob Hoskins), whose mob connections suggest foul play as Simo's investigation progresses. Reeves' subsequent lover (played by Robin Tunney) may also be culpable, and as Simo's own personal life unravels, his empathy for Reeves takes on added significance. In presenting its mystery as a set of plausible scenarios,Hollywoodlandholds interest as a mystery that's refreshingly compassionate toward the fate of its characters. Warts and all, they're likable dreamers in a town where dreams don't always come true.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000K2UVZM", "B002VWNICC", "B003P3PQL2", "B000A5046K", "B000BT96FA", "B000EU1Q3Q", "B000HWZ4E8", "B000IU37SO", "B00005JL5F", "B00015HWX2", "B0009G3B0G", "B00AEBB89W", "B000087F7Q", "B000QGEB1M", "B000LC3IDS", "B00003CWSR", "B003UESJEW", "B000EQHXNW", "B004SEUIZG", "0783235380", "B0001WTVIE", "B001NFNFNU", "1618933949", "B0002V7O5Q", "B000AM6P2U", "B000I8OM94", "B00J2PQYYK", "B00ICWO1LC", "B00006RCNY", "B00000K31T", "B0016Q2D66", "B00002RAO2", "B003UESJCY", "B000092T3P", "B000OYAT3U", "6305428522", "B003VEL9EI", "B00HZVX14O", "B004SIP7VM", "0790732149", "B001U0HB5Q", "B004XVMCH6", "B000HT3PBU", "B00AEFXRWO", "B00GUO2SKA", "B00006RCNV", "B004XVMCKS", "B0000959N0", "B00I116MVQ", "B000Q8QH0I", "B00AEFYC96", "B00ARA4SLU", "B00HGBAG5K", "B00006CXGZ", "B004LYWPZE", "B004ALIG1U", "B0016MOWOQ", "B000IJ79XE", "B00DC5JVE6", "B000M341SC", "B00029LO5E", "B00CHMBQRA", "B000F7CMRM", "B000FO0AHY", "B00E18QKJ2", "B0045O2PHS", "B004SIP7PS", "B0001NBNDY", "B00J5LXT44", "B003VE9WU6", "B000C65Z1G", "B00AEFYIDG", "B00005JMON", "B00005JL8F", "B00009MEKN", "B00HT2RTU6", "B000EHSVSC", "B0006IIKQW", "B00AEFXBPM", "B00HOGBXTU", "B003LR5BD0", "B0018O4YT0", "B0000694ZI", "B00005NKSK", "B002J1RZHE", "B000286RNE", "B0030BOCMS", "B00H91LVOM", "B000YV1Q2G", "B002DU39GW", "B003UESJEM", "B00F6SHG5S", "B000MXPE7O", "B001N44BVQ", "B0089XJXRQ", "B003EYVXSW", "B001DJ7PR8", "B0000C2IVA", "B000U1ZV76", "B0002O7XUO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000K2UVZM", "0596101996", "B002VWNICC", "0596805527"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 921340}, "asin": "B00005JP90", "imUrl": "http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-site/icons/no-img-sm._CB192198896_.gif", "title": "Hollywoodland"}
{"description": "Alas! The fifthHarry Potterfilm has arrived. The time is long past that this can be considered a simple \"children's\" series--though children and adults alike will enjoy it immensely. Starting off from the dark and tragic ending of the fourth film,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenixbegins in a somber and angst-filled tone that carries through the entire 138 minutes (the shortest of anyHPmovie despite being adapted from the longest book). Hopes of winning the Quidditch Cup have been replaced by woes like government corruption, distorted media spin, and the casualties of war. As the themes have matured, so have the primary characters' acting abilities. Ron (Rupert Grint), Hermione (Emma Watson), and especially Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) are more convincing than ever--in roles that are more demanding.Harry is deeply traumatized from having witnessed Cedric Diggory's murder, but he will soon find that this was just another chapter in the continuing loss he will endure. Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) has returned and, in an attempt to conceal this catastrophe from the wizarding public, the Ministry of Magic has teamed up with the wizard newspaperThe Daily Prophetto smear young Potter and wise Dumbledore (Michael Gambon)--seemingly the only two people in the public eye who believe the Dark Lord has returned. With no one else to stand against the wicked Death Eaters, the Hogwarts headmaster is forced to revive his secret anti-Voldemort society, the Order of the Phoenix. This welcomes back characters like Mad-Eye Moody (Brendan Gleeson), kind Remus Lupin (David Thewlis), fatherly Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), and insidious Severus Snape (Alan Rickman), and introduces a short list of intriguing new faces. In the meantime, a semi-psychotic bureaucrat from the Ministry (brilliantly portrayed by Imelda Staunton) has seized power at Hogwarts, and Harry is forced to form a secret society of his own--lest the other young wizards at his school be left ill-equipped to defend themselves in the looming war between good and evil. In addition, Harry is filled with an inexplicable rage that only his Godfather Sirius seems to be able to understand.This film, though not as frightening as its predecessor, earns its PG-13 rating mostly because of the ever-darkening tone.  As always, the loyal fans of J.K. Rowling's books will suffer huge cuts from the original plot and character developments, but make no mistake: this is agoodmovie.--Jordan ThompsonOn the DVDThe second disc ofThe Order of the Phoenixfeatures \"The Hidden Secrets of Harry Potter,\" a retrospective on the series so far, with \"Potter experts\" (i.e., people who run fan sites) weighing in on what's to come. This must have been filmed during production, because all their speculation about the conclusion of the saga is clearly dated and therefore superfluous (sinceOrderreleased theatrically at the same time as the seventh book, one would've expected a more current analysis). Many of the deleted scenes are mostly extensions, with the exception of one hilarious take of Professor Trelawney (Emma Thompson) trying--unsuccessfully--to eat gracefully during Dolores Umbridge's introduction at Hogwarts. The chatty actress Natalia Tena, who plays Tonks, gives a tour of the set in \"Trailing Tonks,\" even playing a Christmas song she wrote on her guitar, and director David Yates and editor Mark Day demonstrate editing 101 with a feature that lets you edit your own scene from the movie.

{"description": "For die-hard horror fans,The Hills Have Eyes 2is a knock-off remake/sequel that delivers a few queasy thrills. While it represents a minor improvement over the 1985 sequel to Wes Craven's 1977 original (you know, the one with the notorious \"canine flashback\"), it's yet another cookie-cutter exercise in death by stupidity, focusing its Aliens-in-the-desert plot on a scrappy, ill-tempered unit of National Guard soldiers who've been sent to investigate the first remake's hellish aftermath in the bomb-tested wastelands of Nevada. (Like its far-superior 2006 predecessor, this sequel was shot on location in Morocco.) Unfortunately these bickering recruits are an embarrassment to their inauthentic-looking uniforms, and their reckless inexperience (not to mention a tired, uninspired screenplay by Craven and his son Jonathan) makes them easy targets for the ravenous, irradiated mutants who dwell within a treacherous network of tunnels and caves. As the generically good-looking cast is reduced to a few terrorized survivors (which somehow doesn't stop costars Jessica Stroup and Daniella Alonso from looking like fashion models), music-video director Martin Weisz switches to auto-pilot in his dubious feature debut, serving up a basically plotless succession of grisly makeup FX by Howard Berger and his crack team of gore-mongers. The gross-out factor is sufficiently amusing (including one soldier pulled through a hole with one leg in the totally wrong direction), but even devoted horror connoisseurs will have to admit this is pretty lame stuff. --Jeff ShannonBeyondThe Hills Have Eyes 2AllHills Have EyesMoviesThe Hills Have Eyes: The BeginningWes Craven: The Art of HorrorStills fromThe Hills Have Eyes", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000FAOC2W", "B005GT3X68", "B00005JMDZ", "B008G4T7W4", "B000TJBN62", "B000KJU1KK", "B002G1WPG8", "B00018D42W", "B000UJ48P4", "B000E8M0P6", "B002G1WPI6", "B000EHRVP6", "B005OK722U", "B000AM4P9K", "B00005RHGK", "B000VKL6Z2", "B00009MGEM", "B0000E2R6P", "B002YICNE2", "B000WC389G", "B00BM4Q4H6", "B000AXWHSA", "B0031U8OEK", "B002DKGWSE", "B004EI2NP4", "B001NPD9LS", "B0041KKYCY", "B008JFUNYG", "B001D2WU9I", "B004EPZ08O", "B0021L8UXA", "B002FICQFM", "B000RGN2JI", "B000GCFO0I", "B00CERJI5U", "B004AC6PV2", "B00006FI0R", "B000N3AW6G", "B00196UTEG", "B00111YM5Q", "B000I2J68M", "B003Q6D27S", "B002ZG971U", "B00AZTUUQK", "B00005UQ9W", "B000PMLJMQ", "B000FC2HS6", "B00C2R122Y", "B00005LC4Q", "B000MM0LIM", "B000IHY9TS", "B00A2H9L2E", "B000FS9FE4", "B001GCUO4S", "B000NO3DLG", "B0021L8UFI", "B0021L8UPS", "B000TJBN80", "B00DMUFXOS", "B002ZG98KK", "B00AIBZLVY", "B001L9EXUC", "B004P7CN7W", "B00AJLHUA8", "B002JT69IW", "B000RIWAVW", "B001KEHAEO", "B000A5045Q", "B0037E8HNI", "B0000VCZMK", "B00C7C00JU", "B0020PFYHC", "B00005JMA8", "B001JNNDJM", "B000LC3ID8", "B0002C4JJ4", "B001P3SA9Y", "B000XUUQQK", "B000CNER1S", "B003YF9PX6", "B002S0OB8M", "B003PIUINS", "B001MEJY8W", "B000099T3M", "B00BEIYGT8", "B00005JLKN", "B00B96TGQS", "B001QMCJ0U", "B0000AOX09", "B004LWZW24", "0780631684", "B001U0HBQA", "B00005JO16", "B008G33PIM", "B002AS45VK", "B000AA4JL6", "B00006FDBT", "B00CAATSME", "B00275EHFU"], "bought_together": ["B000FAOC2W", "B00005JMDZ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000FAOC2W", "B000E8M0P6", "B005GT3X68", "B008BM5WQG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 74238}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 19.88, "brand": "Twentieth Century Fox", "asin": "B00005JPLQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61Jte4gSODL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Hills Have Eyes 2 (Unrated Edition)"}
{"description": "The Dark Knightarrives with tremendous hype (best superhero movie ever? posthumous Oscar for Heath Ledger?), and incredibly, it lives up to all of it.  But calling it the best superhero movie ever seems like faint praise, since part of what makes the movie great--in addition to pitch-perfect casting, outstanding writing, and a compelling vision--is that it bypasses the normal fantasy element of the superhero genre and makes it all terrifyingly real.  Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) is Gotham City's new district attorney, charged with cleaning up the crime rings that have paralyzed the city. He enters an uneasy alliance with the young police lieutenant, Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman), and Batman (Christian Bale), the caped vigilante who seems to trust only Gordon--and whom only Gordon seems to trust. They make progress until a psychotic and deadly new player enters the game: the Joker (Heath Ledger), who offers the crime bosses a solution--kill the Batman. Further complicating matters is that Dent is now dating Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal, after Katie Holmes turned down the chance to reprise her role), the longtime love of Batman's alter ego, Bruce Wayne.In his last completed role before his tragic death, Ledger is fantastic as the Joker, a volcanic, truly frightening force of evil. And he sets the tone of the movie: the world is a dark, dangerous place where there are no easy choices.  Eckhart and Oldman also shine, but as good as Bale is, his character turns out rather bland in comparison (not uncommon for heroes facing more colorful villains). Director-cowriter Christopher Nolan (Memento) follows his critically acclaimedBatman Beginswith an even better sequel that sets itself apart from notable superhero movies likeSpider-Man 2andIron Manbecause of its sheer emotional impact and striking sense of realism--there are no suspension-of-disbelief superpowers here. At 152 minutes, it's a shade too long, and it's much too intense for kids. But for most movie fans--and not just superhero fans--The Dark Knightis a film for the ages.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B00DUCXFUC", "B004LWZWGK", "B000PC6A3E", "B002ZG981E", "B00G4RD4PQ", "B0039208QM", "B001GMALGY", "B00E2Y0YBK", "B00C2IGQBA", "B0039208JE", "B00H14WTLQ", "B0039208CG", "B0085D3I3K", "B0039208C6", "B000M5AJQI", "B00319ECGK", "B001FB55H6", "B00EIG5M5A", "7020070078", "B00E2Y6AUY", "B00D5FMGGS", "B001OQCV6K", "B0013FBS20", "B000Q6GX5Y", "B001GKJ2FC", "B00FPS79F6", "B001992NUQ", "B004JMSIRC", "B001RIY4WE", "B00DYEN6XC", "B008QZ5PY2", "B001F7MSG6", "B00FAHYNWE", "B00J7PRJXU", "B001AQT0Z4", "B001UV4XEW", "B0083SBJXS", "B00AEFY552", "B00C8RD79O", "B007KAJG3K", "B007L4HET8", "B004EPZ07U", "B007L4HFDI", "B00AEFXKOO", "B000PC0U1W", "B00C6B8TB8", "B00HINFI4K", "B003TT2X6I", "B001KZIRM2", "B002ZG99NG", "B00EZ4M68G", "B004SIP90G", "B003ZHR6RK", "B001GCUO16", "B003TT2X6S", "B00JNEWSLS", "B001F3FUK6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00DUCXFUC", "B004LWZWGK", "B002ZG981E", "B000PC6A3E"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "asin": "B00005JPY0", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51pGxSkkz4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Dark Knight [Theatrical Release]"}
{"description": "Pete Seeger readsThe Wall Street Journal! That's perhaps the most startling revelation in Jim Brown's (The Weavers: Wasn't That a Time) wonderful documentary that etches an indelible portrait of an American icon and a global treasure. As a solo performer and as a member of the Weavers, Seeger introduced America to its musical heritage and was instrumental in ushering in the folk music revival in the 1960s. Branded as an \"evil Commie\" for his leftist beliefs, he is hailed here as an \"absolute patriot\" and \"a living testament to the First Amendment.\" Seeger didn't call out politicians or presidents. He called out backward policies, unjust laws, and divisive attitudes. Songs that he popularized, or were covered by others, such as \"We Shall Overcome,\" \"The Hammer Song,\" \"Where Have All the Flowers Gone,\" and \"Turn, Turn, Turn,\" became Civil Rights and anti-war anthems. Music, he eloquently states inThe Power of Song, should not be used just to forget one's troubles, but to also help to understand and to do something about your troubles. Whether singing work songs at union rallies or Woody Guthrie's \"This Land Is Your Land\" to schoolchildren, Seeger used folk music as a uniter.The Power of Songis a profile in courage. In dramatic archival footage, he is seen defying the House Un-American Activities Committee. Seeger, never in it for the money, recalls how he quit the phenomenally popular Weavers when the other members agreed to do a cigarette commercial. Seeger was green before green was cool. At 88, he lives in the log cabin that he built and continues to work the land; chopping wood and hauling water. This film also chronicles his successful campaign to clean up the polluted Hudson River.The Power of Song\"is more than a great life story. It's also a great love story. Toshi, his wife of more than 60 years, emerges as an extraordinary woman who has greatly sacrificed to allow Seeger to take his music and message around the world (at one point she jokes that she wished her husband chased women instead of causes so she could leave him). Seeger says his singing voice is gone, but his spirit is undimmed (one clip captures him standing on the roadside with a handful of war protesters). Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, Bonnie Raitt, Natalie Maines of the Dixie Chicks, Mary Travers, and family members are among those who pay tribute, but Seeger's own plain-spoken words and the concert footage and performance clips--by turns joyous and profoundly moving--take full measure of the man as a musicologist, iconoclast, and \"social artist.\" One admirer says of Seeger that he stood for justice and had powerful enemies. That makes him sound like a superhero. In his own gentle way, perhaps he was.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B00BQH9UXY", "B007SBHKGQ", "B00GC04EMM", "B0000026V0", "B001SGKQI6", "1612052185", "B007DIP7BO", "B0057UMR8Q", "B00000611U", "B000X1ZPEM", "B0009I1WAA", "B0012EBU7U", "B0054QHIFK", "B002LMOAUQ", "B000006C89", "B0012GMVYO", "B000VNMSAQ", "B001O4C6LM", "B00EO2I6T2", "B0009YA39U", "B000001DO5", "B0079IL9ZQ", "B00005MLVE", "B002ZIVZ7W", "B000002G50", "B0000AKCMH", "B000001DJU", "B001I1LQU8", "B0000DZ3D6", "0393338614", "B008OHV4II", "B000BC8SVA", "B000000EBD", "B003UCPETM", "B000B76V2I", "B001C3ANE2", "B000GG4XJM", "B000GY721K", "B000NRRWOM", "B00006JTG5", "B000000EFX", "B00029J258", "B0000AZKDJ", "B000000EF4", "B0035LL078", "B003BCBZ6M", "B004N2L7MQ", "B00006GOEA", "B000CELOC2", "B001CW7LPM", "B008MLQ9V8", "B00HE0OPFU", "B000PTYRZ0", "B001EJIKYE", "B000002YAE", "B00F65K96E", "B003UCPET2", "B0000AYL2M", "B005J7K9FU"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00BQH9UXY", "B007SBHKGQ", "B0000026V0", "B00GC04EMM"]}, "price": 16.32, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "asin": "B00005JPY4", "imUrl": "http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-site/icons/no-img-sm._CB192198896_.gif", "title": "Pete Seeger - The Power of Song [Theatrical Release]"}

{"description": "Fortunately, John Wayne had two vastly more interesting feature films (Rooster CogburnandThe Shootist) left in him following this disposable, leaden 1975 fish-out-of-water story. Wayne phones in his performance as a Chicago cop, Jim Brannigan, whose hunt for a fugitive in London is mostly an excuse for cross-cultural conflicts and comedy. Richard Attenborough adds local color as a Scotland Yard detective who partners with the Duke, and Judy Geeson plays a lovely, liberated constable who won't brook Brannigan's ingrained sexism. The by-the-numbers script is more pacifying for diehard Wayne fans than exciting to everyone, and the film looks embarrassingly ornamental with its naked display of touristy backdrops. Still,Branniganis a slick tribute to the staying power of an American icon.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000O599YY", "B000O599W6", "B00006L92Y", "B000O599M6", "B000O599Y4", "0783230400", "0783230478", "B00BGQ2P9G", "B00BFWKE62", "B000O59A0C", "B000O179JK", "B000O599X0", "B000O599VM", "B00E4DJK78", "B0009ML2JC", "B000O599MG", "B000BPL2FG", "B000O599US", "B000O599XU", "B000O599LW", "B00AOO5QTM", "0783228031", "0782010040", "B00005S8KR", "B000F0UUIC", "B00008CMR6", "B0082LUFA4", "B000HT38D0", "B00CFHEE08", "B00BGARG50", "B0001FVDX2", "B000O599ZI", "B00008MTW7", "B000O599YE", "B00008MTW5", "B00B1CGFVE", "B00AEBB8YM", "B00393SG0G", "078322592X", "B00AEFYBA6", "B000O599NU", "B00AEFXUL2", "B00B1CGE1A", "B00008CMR4", "B000EQHXMI", "B00C3ALKYK", "B00BNH9NNE", "B00AEFXSVE", "B009A881OA", "B0009ML2KQ", "B008A1TXB8", "B00AEFY6ZQ", "B00004ZBVE", "B008I34XW2", "B008A1TXMM", "B00C3ALLPS", "B000HT38C6", "0782011276", "B000O599YO", "B000ANVPP6", "B00008MTW6", "B000N4SHW6", "6304696612", "B000059TFU", "B008I34YC6", "B00AEFYL6K", "B00009NH89", "B00AMQGFYM", "B00BN2JWOY", "B000O599N0", "B008I34Y6M", "B009YX8MSG", "B000O599NK", "B00A196N8I", "B003P485AK", "B000O599Z8", "B003TTZT8W", "B0000640U0", "B000O599XA", "B00AEBBA0E", "B000O599WQ", "B004XWGZAU", "B004DY1VIO", "B008A1TXX6", "B000ANVPPQ", "B000O599NA", "B000U1ZV6M", "B0014BJ1A4", "B0045HCJSK", "B000N4SHX0", "B000NNUWZC", "B00007JZXL", "B00005ASGH", "B00A196OCI", "B001PO55LE", "B00005PJ8S", "B00INVMNO4", "B00BM4Q4KS", "B008I34ZHA"], "bought_together": ["B000O599YY", "0783230478"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000O599YY", "B00AMQGFYM", "0783230478", "B00008CMR4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 58444}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 40.99, "brand": "", "asin": "B00005N89K", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51EEMNSDP7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Brannigan"}

With  the same attention to emotional detail that he brought toMoonstruck, Jewison establishes a delicate balance of anguish  and bittersweet humor, reaching peak intensity as two couples confront  the aftershocks of infidelity. Dennis Quaid and Andie MacDowell play  the steady pair, committed to surviving every marital peak and valley.  Greg Kinnear and Toni Collette are splitting up, divided by his  infidelity and forced to reevaluate connections to their long-term  friends. While Jewison and cinematographer Roger Deakins expertly  translate the stagy material, the revealing, nonjudgmental quality of  Margulies's dialogue inspires excellence from this quartet of  underrated actors.

{"description": "The remarkable story of Hollywood legend Judy Garland is vividly told in this widely acclaimed film, which features amazing, Emmy Award-winning portrayals by Judy Davis (Best Actress) and Tammy Blanchard (Best Supporting Actress). Loved by millions the world over, Judy was the brightest star in Hollywood's Golden Era. Away from the bright lights and brilliant performances, however, her devotion was to her family. But while she loved her children unconditionally, they could only desperately try and hang on to their mother as a powerful dependence on alcohol and prescription drugs began to consume her life. Based on the book by Garland's daughter Lorna Luft, and honored recipient of 5 Emmy Awards, LIFE WITH JUDY GARLAND: ME AND MY SHADOWS is a deeply moving testament to the healing powers of embracing one's past, facing one's demons, and charting a course of self-discovery!", "related": {"also_bought": ["B003B3V0X4", "B0013D8LI6", "B0000714B8", "B0001US6CI", "B0000714B6", "B00AATGDY8", "B000059QY9", "0671019007", "630521056X", "0385335156", "B000C65Z8Y", "067101899X", "B002BI4JKG", "B000EBD9RQ", "B004GJYR50", "B0001DCYUK", "B005VUTRGW", "B005F265FW", "B000BO0LF4", "0060113375", "B001A5HG24", "B00000I9CJ", "B00IXD2N1K", "B002IW62R8", "B000EBFLHC", "B0000714B9", "B00006IU5W", "B00D2CYU2W", "B000GETTIO", "B0000714BA", "B003V4JU1W", "B0001AW106", "0762437715", "B00004YZFX", "B00008L3MK", "B00005JNA9", "B00IZIGFNU", "B000WTZ63U", "B000WC39ZY", "B00AEFYNG8", "B00I04SVV8", "B0075FF5NA", "B00004STRE", "B005IA9K2G", "B00JPL3UTS", "B0036ZKLEQ", "1589797876", "B0054DPLUC", "B004H83IFU", "B00006RCO1", "B001NPDCFQ", "B009NYF2GQ", "B004VK744A", "B004SUDQ8G", "B002CAWNFQ", "B0013N2WFY", "B007VX03SS", "B003156IJ8", "B000O76ZR6", "0783114907", "B00GMM19X2", "B009VOLSA2", "B0008GGN9I", "B0017I79BW", "B001KP2J3U", "B00005O3VD", "B0033AI4PM", "B00005ALM7", "B0000AYJV8", "B00GOC74RU", "B00A33J8RK", "B0009PVZIW", "B004132I6Q", "B00DJFTBZI", "B008B4KVPQ", "B004GSVXAI", "1567994369", "B00GSBMNOQ", "B00I9BU5ZM", "B000KHI2FS", "B00CNW9ZEU", "B00AEFYO5I", "0375503781", "B00005QTA3", "0062278010", "B0012GN1Y8", "1451684568"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003B3V0X4", "B0013D8LI6", "0671019007", "B00AATGDY8"]}, "price": 6.83, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 50943}, "asin": "B00005U8QP", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/511EP8P9F5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Life with Judy Garland - Me and My Shadows"}

As the zealous, unfailingly polite eccentric declares economic war on a veritable back-country feudal lord who runs his own steam-powered soda plant (Bill Kerr), Roberts&#x92;s enchantingly goofy secretary (Greta Scacchi) plots a campaign of seduction that includes a Santa suit that explodes in an orgiastic blizzard of feathers. Yugoslavian director Dusan Makavejev (Montenegro), hardly known for romantic comedy, brings a surprisingly light touch to the comedy and a sweet sexiness to the offbeat love story. The script veers into scenes that make no sense and gets bogged down in the cola wars, but Makavejev buoys the film with unexpected turns, delightful moments of beauty and joy, and a genial, generous sense of humor.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000AUHQ6", "B004SUDQC2", "B00005IA7Z", "B000MQ54M6", "B006TTC5HC", "B0020LH8WU", "B00198X0XQ", "B0010AN7YA", "B00H9HZITU", "B005XB8T68", "B000062XF2", "B002AT4JNI", "B00004Y62V", "B00CPTUO1Y", "B000BT96DM", "B00004WG8U", "0783230559", "B000056HEF", "B00817MQBK", "B000WMFZRO", "B0016BO72O", "B008F4MNEY", "B007TMYL3O", "B005Q4CKLC", "B0083QN87K", "B006M3M5FM", "B005BYBZKY", "B0075CUT98", "0792839633", "B001U2QER0", "B000V6LTDU", "B002YKN2Z4"]}, "price": 84.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 77254}, "asin": "B00005V9HU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51VKWVKN26L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Coca-Cola Kid"}

Between arc threads are several pleasing excursions: time travel to a Bermuda Triangle boatload of Nazis (\"Triangle\"), further temporal escapades akin toGroundhog Day(\"Monday\"), a demonic baby case featuring genre stalwart Bruce Campbell (\"Terms of Endearment\"), and Duchovny being able to play someone else via personality switching (\"The Dreamland, Parts 1 and 2\").

If so, chances are good you've yet to discoverThe Incredible Mr. Limpet. Starring the irrepressible Don Knotts, this 1964 family feature combines live (land) action and animated (undersea) sequences with delightful results. During World War II, Knotts is mild-mannered, spectacle-sporting bookkeeper Henry Limpet. More than anything--he's a fish fan and a patriot. When the navy rejects him due to poor eyesight, he falls into a funk from which not even his beloved aquarium or loving--if bossy--wife can rescue him. So he makes a wish... to become a fish. Next thing he knows--he is! With a little help from a hermit crab named Crusty and the lovely Ladyfish, it's as a talking, bespectacled fish that Limpet proves himself the war hero he always knew he was meant to be.--Kathleen C.

{"description": "Notoriously, and entirely appropriately, the original outline for Doug Naylor and Rob Grant's comedy sci-fi seriesRed Dwarfwas sketched on the back of a beer mat. When it finally appeared on British television in 1988, the show had clearly stayed true to its roots, mixing jokes about excessive curry consumption with affectionate parodies of classic sci-fi. Indeed, one of the show's most endearing and enduring features is its obvious respect for genre conventions, even as it gleefully subverts them. The scenario owes something to Douglas Adams's satiricalHitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, something toThe Odd Couple, and a lot more to the slacker sci-fi of John Carpenter'sDark Star. Behind the crew's constant bickering there lurks an impending sense that life, the universe, and everything are all someone's idea of a terrible joke.Later seasons broadened the show's horizons until at last its premise was so diluted as to be unrecognizable, but in the six episodes of the first season, the comedy is witty and intimate, focusing on characters and not special effects. Slob Dave Lister (Craig Charles) is the last human alive after a radiation leak wipes out the crew of the vast mining vesselRed Dwarf(Episode 1, \"The End\"). He bums around the spaceship with the perpetually uptight and annoyed hologram of his dead bunkmate, Arnold Rimmer (Chris Barrie, the show's greatest comedy asset), and a creature evolved from a cat (dapper Danny John Jules). They are guided rather haphazardly by Holly, the worryingly thick main computer (lugubrious Norman Lovett).--Mark Walker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00007AP32", "B0000WN0ZA", "B0000WN0ZU", "B0006Z2L0G", "B0006Z2L0Q", "B000EU1Q4U", "B000BVM1TQ", "B0026P3HPW", "B009Z59778", "B000BHHVNQ", "B002FQJT0Y", "B001DF681G", "B009Z5BPYG", "B002GP7ZV4", "B007AFC0W4", "B002BAW6FE", "B006LPHY6G", "0140174664", "B001NOMOS8", "B001YYQA0K", "B00006LPCK", "B002EOVX9W", "B00443FN1A", "B002GP7ZVO", "B002LFQIMQ", "B006LPHY5C", "B002LFPAUM", "B00FAVRFXE", "B002BAW6GI", "B0007G89FU", "0140143882", "B002LFQIMG", "B00004Z4TO", "B008R52LA2", "B0000DZSYB", "B00272NJ7K", "B000GI3RZ6", "B002LFQIN0", "B002BAW6H2", "B002BAW6FY", "B002D1XKB0", "B0000UJL96", "B000FIHN8O", "B001T46TCE", "0451452011", "B00HCK7THS", "B001AGXEBU", "B00008KA57", "B003L77GWE", "B001D2WUGG", "B002BIULNA", "B001QCWQ62", "B00BD6K54G", "B00GOC74QG", "B001Q9ECNA", "B000BP86Y6", "B001QCWQ5S", "B005PPMHO2", "B00064AME4", "B00AZMFJYA", "0140171509", "B0009X75J2", "B000Z7G87C", "B00005A1SY", "B00009MEJT", "B000HWZ4HU", "B004EXWGHY", "B004QOB8TS", "B000AYELJ2", "B000067FPC", "B001HUWQEA", "B000AJJNFE", "B000127LW2", "B00022FWEU", "B000RO9PTQ", "B00ECXJC28", "B002I9Z8BM", "B001QCWQ58", "B00D3ZJFBO", "B0000AQS0F", "B005SH65GI", "B001C71IGA", "B002I9Z8AS", "B000777I88", "B001O4C6NA", "B000LC4ZI0", "B00129W6LE", "B000QRI1GW", "B0089AD8IO", "B000KGGIRI", "B000FJH5MC", "B004QOB8SO"], "bought_together": ["B00007AP32", "B0000WN0ZA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000GI3RZ6", "B009Z59778", "B0006Z2L0G", "B0026P3HPW"]}, "price": 13.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 90398}, "asin": "B00007AP31", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51F8ZQYDF9L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Red Dwarf: Series I"}

{"description": "To the ranks of shows too brilliant and outrageous for prime time (The Ben Stiller Show,Andy Richter Controls the Universe), add Seth McFarlane'sFamily Guy. This animated series, which debuted after the 1999 Super Bowl, simply sparked too much controversy and offended too many sensibilities to survive (Entertainment Weeklydubbed it \"the Awful Show They Just Keep Putting on the Air\"). That the Fox network also played hackysack with its schedule, ensuring viewers would not be able to find it, sealed its fate (it was cancelled in 2002). This boxed set containing all 28 episodes from the first two seasons is payback for the show's devoted cult following, who may be moved to echo the words of infant Stewie Griffin, the megalomaniacal 1-year-old bent on matricide and world domination: \"Victory is mine!\"The dysfunctional Griffins of Quahog, Rhode Island, invite comparisons toThe Simpsons. The testicular-chinned father, Peter Griffin, is a clueless oaf in the Homer mold. \"Peter, what did you promise me last night?\" asks his long-suffering wife Lois in one episode. \"That I wouldn't drink at the stag party,\" he replies. \"And what did you do?\" she asks. \"Drank at the stag part--oh ho ho, I almost walked into that one,\" he cackles. Other family members include teenage daughter Meg, a desperate high school social pariah; 13-year-old son Chris, a chip off his father's blockhead; and Brian, the family's sarcastic talking dog. But this series' true inspiration is football-pated Stewie (voiced by McFarlane, who earned an Emmy), who was born to be a Bond villain once he escaped his mother's \"ovarian bastille.\"Family Guyrecklessly ventured whereThe Simpsonsfeared to tread. In one episode, Meg's one and only friend turns out to be the member of a suicidal cult. In another, Death (voiced by Norm McDonald) becomes an unwanted houseguest. Each episode plays fast and furious with surreal flashes (in one episode, Peter turns his house into a puppet) and pop-culture references and TV, movie, and commercial parodies that invite repeated viewings. Freed from its own family-hour bastille and the whims of dim network executives,Family Guycan be appreciated at last on its own profane, sacrilegious, and irreverent terms. Welcome to the DVD family, Griffins.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00008YGRV", "B000AQ68Z0", "B000HT3P6U", "B000RO6JZO", "B0012018OE", "B001VFM0ZG", "B003DZX46G", "B003L77G9W", "B0058YPMHO", "B00E0FW054", "B000E6ES9O", "B000A3DFV8", "B00FR81Z40", "B003V3FVQ6", "B000NNK4DM", "B0006B41GM", "B0040JHX0W", "B0012KSUTA", "B001N9VW5Y", "B001RIZ7OI", "B003X4KHRG", "B002LARYTW", "B002JVWQYG", "B00023P49C", "B003CN5B7E", "B000YOX3HE", "B008412UKA", "B0053O8A32", "B0058RN7KA", "B003L77G7Y", "B00023P49M", "B007KFZ85K", "B000E0OE3K", "B00008YGRS", "B0000CABL2", "B00LFW6BA0", "B00BYNL8DU", "B0001ZWLVU", "B008412UQ4", "B004696M94", "B007KFZ7UQ", "B005QIOJUI", "B0044E9JTG", "B007KFZ88M", "B000RW3VDE", "B009SQ9Q5M", "B00A2JFNSS", "B0018RKEQE", "B007KFZ7PG", "B000067DNE", "B007KFZ7YM", "B007KFZ8AK", "B001L1S1PS", "B0001MZ7KA", "B000CNESM6", "B002LASCJ8", "B007KFZ87S", "B007KFZ7Q0", "B0002WZRSG", "B004MLEYTG", "B0006Z2L2Y", "B007KFZ8AA", "B00005JM3G", "B008OTH56Q", "B000ADWCYY", "B007ZFR67I", "B000B5XOR0", "B000FSME2Y", "B0044E9JSW", "B000FEBWTE", "B000B5XOWU", "B0000C2IQB", "B008AITJ7O", "B00000F5W8", "B007KFZ8B4", "B00005JOHC", "B005CGI4EG", "B0086UVMEE", "B000W91RUG", "B0024FAR6Q", "B000ERVJNG", "B003L77G6U", "B0060OKO2O", "B00BUWD7Y8", "B006W93ELK", "B001O0TWXG", "B003KZ27N0", "B00775R45A", "B000GPIPTM", "B002N5N4FS", "B0030Y11UG", "B000GETTKM", "B00HDU9UOW", "B002C11LCG", "B0000AQS81", "B00AIANIPQ", "B000KLQUMQ", "B000TM1CKQ", "B004XVMCH6", "B004MLEYUK"], "bought_together": ["B00008YGRV", "B000AQ68Z0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00008YGRV", "B00E0FW054", "B000HT3P6U", "B003L77G9W"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 28363}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 11.89, "brand": "20th Century Fox", "asin": "B000083C6V", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51N2CR5F9CL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Family Guy, Volume One"}
{"description": "Friends' peerless writing staff really spreads the wealth in this pivotal third season. Each of this seamless ensemble's cast members was given a story arc that deepened and enriched their characters. Most devastatingly, Ross (David Schwimmer) and Rachel's (freshly minted Emmy-winner Jennifer Aniston) romance is torn asunder by Ross's jealousy (not to mention his one-night stand while the couple are, now famously, \"on a break\"). Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow) is reunited with her half brother (Giovanni Ribisi) and meets a family friend (Terri Garr; inspired casting) who drops a Darth Vader-esque bombshell about Phoebe's parentage. Monica (Courtney Cox) begins the season reeling from her breakup with Richard (Tom Selleck, who reappears in \"The One Where Monica and Richard Are Friends\"), but rebounds with Pete (Jon Favreau fromSwingers), a millionaire (\"He's the perfect guy,\" she states. \"He has everything. Plus he actually has everything\"). Chandler is driven to increasingly hysterical attempts to \"go through the tunnel\" and commit to his relationship with Janice (Maggie Wheeler). And womanizer Joey (Matt LeBlanc) reveals his soulful side when he falls for an initially contemptuous theatrical costar. Also lending memorable support are Alison LaPlaca, as Rachel's self-absorbed new boss, and an Emmy-worthy Ben Stiller (\"The One with the Screamer\") as Rachel's new boyfriend whose volcanic temper only erupts in front of Ross.Friendscontinues its hit-and-miss history with A-list cameos. Robin Williams and Billy Crystal (\"The One with the Ultimate Fighting Champion\") are about as funny as the woeful film they were hyping,Fathers' Day. More memorable is Isabella Rossellini (\"The One with Frank Jr.\"), whom the hapless Ross meets just after crossing her off his \"freebie list\" of celebrities Rachel would allow him to sleep with. Other classic episodes include the season-opener, \"The One with the Princess Leia Fantasy\" and \"The One with the Flashback,\" which offers some provocative near-couplings between Monica and Joey, Ross and Phoebe, and Chandler and Rachel. Add a chick and a duck (\"The One with a Chick, and a Duck\"), and you have a benchmark season in this irreplaceable series. But still: You'd think a million dollars an episode would buy some DVD cast commentary!--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B003TNW04Y", "B000068CNX", "B0000C2IXN", "B003TNW030", "B003TNW02G", "B0001AW066", "B0006ZM8M2", "B003TNW03K", "B003TNW03A", "B005IA9JRM", "B005IA9JVI", "B005IA9JQI", "B005MG8UNG", "B005IA9JSG", "B00B1LKXPY", "B00020HAWY", "B005SJGIV8", "B000ERVK5S", "B000HT3P7E", "B000TM1CKQ", "B0002I84FS", "B002BAW6HW", "B0019CSXAM", "B001BJARX4", "B004STBF5S", "B002BJGYTY", "B000EAT23C", "B000W91RUG", "B008LCRA7K", "B001L1S1WQ", "B007C8RZJW", "B008LCRAC0", "B00IFK7ONI", "B0077PTWHI", "0785139400", "B00005JM9Q", "B00005JLEX", "B00003CXMP", "B000NA78SE", "B0009WFEEG", "B002WC89WK", "B000NA1PUG", "B000J3OTSM", "B00AEFYM2S", "B004GJYRFA", "B00005JLFT", "B0006J28DM", "B00382S9T6", "B003R0MF7G", "B004I9SJH0", "B008LCRABQ", "B008LCRA98", "B00382S9TQ", "B0009JQN6M", "B001BNFR6M", "B0024FAR6Q", "B004LWZWBU", "B0077PTWY6", "B0002UE1WQ", "B0030VANIU", "B000I0QLQY", "B001VPJZ0O", "B002BWOYKC", "B000P6YNSO", "B00005MEVO", "B001RXDM2C", "B000FL7CAK", "B008LCRAFC", "B001A4VH2U", "B001VPJYZ0", "B005G4FFBE", "B003Y5H574", "B0001907BW", "B007KFZ8AA", "B003Y5H524", "B000MGB6NM", "B002BAW6I6", "B000G1R3A8", "B00003CXKM", "B0036TGSIK", "B003L77G6A", "B000NA2BEU", "B00009Y3RW", "B005IA9JQ8", "B000QFCDAO", "B0072BNKHA", "B004EPZ084", "B002GOAH1U", "B005LAIIB2", "B0012EM5DI", "B00AEFYCW8", "B00007E2F5", "B001AKTZW8", "B00A8KJN8M", "B00EQ2KU7G", "B00006ZXSK", "B000RW3VDE", "B00003CXTG", "B009LDD1X0"], "bought_together": ["B003TNW04Y", "B000068CNX"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005IA9JQ8", "B000068CNX", "B003TNW02G", "B003TNW04Y"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 13026}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 27.5, "brand": "Warner Bros", "asin": "B0000844MI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51TTgmdND3L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Friends: Season 3"}

{"description": "Murder, and its tale-telling aftermath, is the compelling subject ofCSI: Crime Scene Investigation. Since it premiered on CBS on October 6, 2000,CSIwas a ratings triumph, spawning a spinoff (CSI: Miami) and positioning itself for long-term success. As the first season demonstrates, creator Anthony Zuiker's foolproof formula was established early on, bolstered by a fine ensemble cast and requiring minimal tweaking as the season progressed; its Las Vegas-based \"criminalists\" eventually became \"CSI\" steeped in the scientific minutiae of forensic investigation, but the series arrived essentially intact, with an irresistible (and seemingly inexhaustible) supply of corpses and the mysteries that surround them. Influenced by the graphic precedent of movies likeSevenandKiss the Girls,CSImatches morbidity with dispassionate methodology; viewers are so fascinated by the investigative process that they're unfazed by intimate autopsies and internal (i.e., digitally animated) views of traumatized flesh, bone, and sinew.While keeping abreast of cutting-edge technologies,CSIcombines the ingenuity (and fallibility) of villains with the appealing humanity of its heroes. CSI director and entomologist Gil Grissom (played by series coproducer William Petersen) is introverted but ethically intense; he's both mentor and moral compass for his night-shift team, including a former stripper-turned-CSI (Marg Helgenberger); a recovering gambler (Gary Dourdan); an eager ace (George Eads) with room for improvement; a workaholic (Jorja Fox) who can't always remain emotionally detached from her cases; and a chief detective (Paul Guilfoyle) who's a necessary link to police procedure. LikeThe X-Files,CSIsupports its characters with feature-film production values, employing aRashomonstructure that turns murder into a progressively accurate study of cause and effect. Script quality is consistently high (\"Blood Drops\" and \"Unfriendly Skies\" are exceptional), direction is slick and sophisticated, and the mysteries are complex enough to invite multiple viewings. Despite a regrettable shortage of DVD features,CSI's inaugural season remains addictively worthy of its lofty reputation.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000A2ZNL", "B0001906X6", "B0002NY8GW", "B000B8IA08", "B000H7JCGY", "B000UX6TIE", "B001CQONKY", "B001G0MFIS", "B003FSTN5M", "B003R0MEZO", "B0058YPJ8G", "B000B5XOVQ", "B00915G6TE", "B00020H9NO", "B000H7JCE6", "B00064VQXA", "B000SO7PCE", "B001G0MFLA", "B000B8I9ZO", "B000ION72Q", "B001BL6QE6", "B00BLN4V4G", "B000UAE7QI", "B003FSTN6G", "B000H7JCEG", "B000EWBNMI", "B001BL6QDW", "B000SQFC40", "B003R0MF0S", "B005PYL8VQ", "B008F283WW", "B0002DRE72", "B001G0MFL0", "B001AI776G", "B000LE178Y", "B00915G6OE", "B003R0MEZ4", "B003FSTN5W", "B000H7JCHS", "B000HT3P60", "B000MGBSIK", "B003FSTN5C", "B0058YPILY", "B003R0MF08", "B001992NWO", "B005PYKVRI", "B000UO4F98", "B009LDD4V4", "B001G0MFKQ", "B000RO6JYK", "B000FVQLIO", "B003TFAJ18", "B001QE99AQ", "B000TGJ8AS", "B0053O89IS", "B001L1S1OY", "B0019F02X0", "B005PYKNJY", "B002JVWR4A", "B00915G6MG", "B003Q7B7B0", "B002C2KAS6", "B003L77G8I", "B003L77G2E", "B00005JO9J", "B003UD7J26", "B004UXVDOA", "B003UD7JC6", "B00915G6SU", "B001A4VH2U", "B000R9YLKY", "B00JK47BHM", "B005PYL4VU", "B00GTZWUPS", "B00BTFK01Y", "B008X8U83K", "B00CYQXATG", "B00915G4IC", "B003WVJ65Y", "B00B9UEOPC", "B00FR23QNE", "B001715A92", "B000G75ARU", "B001MVWRNE", "B003R4ZMNQ", "B004JR3OKI", "B001GTXZOM", "B00EIXWMII", "B0080QOKHU", "B003R4ZMPE", "B001CTDH76", "B00K6DEQ92", "B0079IEPHK", "B00005JLFT", "B00915G6NK", "B002C6A6N6", "B00FE5MX74", "B000640WGM", "B002UXYCYA"], "bought_together": ["B0000A2ZNL", "B0001906X6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0000A2ZNL", "B0001906X6", "B001G0MFIS", "B003FSTN5M"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 8312}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 12.99, "brand": "Paramount", "asin": "B00008972G", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51VGE374RZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation: Season 1"}
{"description": "Thanks to ultracrisp Technirama photography of great mountainside and river gorge locations in Colorado,Night Passageis often terrific to look at; you can almost feel the autumn sun and brisk air.  This should have been another classic Western pairing James Stewart with director Anthony Mann.  But after choosing the locations, cast, and crew, and directing the precredit sequence, Mann abruptly resigned.  He found Borden Chase's screenplay an \"incoherent\" rehash of relationships and setups from their previous films, nor was he encouraged by Stewart's determination to play the accordion and sing.  Stewart's an ex-railroad cop who became a pariah by letting a prisoner--Audie Murphy's \"The Utica Kid\"--escape.

{"description": "Because of the intense political nature ofTears of the Sun, it's no surprise that a good deal of the DVD content is devoted to the political and historical background of Africa.  Director Antoine Fuqua discusses it in his feature-length commentary track, along with other comments about the film itself.  Another commentary track, in which the authors recall the making of the film and the material that was cut, lasts 17 minutes and is not related to the portion of the film it accompanies.  A pop-up \"fact track\" offers further background and production info, as does a 15-minute making-of featurette.  Eight of the African actors discuss their harrowing personal experiences in \"Voices of Africa,\" and eight deleted scenes wouldn't have added much to the film, other than introducing two small but important characters earlier.

It's a poor man's \"Ocean's Eleven\", just as enjoyable in its own way, beginning when con artist Jake (Edward Burns) discovers he's accidentally stolen from an eccentric crime boss (Dustin Hoffman, oozing threat in a fine character turn). Promising to make amends by pulling the biggest con of his career, Jake adds a feisty pickpocket (Rachel Weisz) to his crew, which includes scene-stealer Paul Giammatti and Andy Garcia as a disheveled FBI agent (or is he?). With a cast like this you can't go wrong, but \"Confidence\" cons itself into thinking it's original, while Burns's abundant voice-overs state the obvious and plot twists unfold with minimal surprise.

{"description": "There is at least one certifiable masterpiece in Rainer Werner Fassbinder'sBRD Trilogy, and one could argue that  all three films qualify for that honor. Conceived as a series of sociopolitical melodramas set during West Germany's \"economic miracle\" of post-war recovery (roughly 1947-60), these exquisitely crafted films found the prolific Fassbinder (1945-82) near the end of his astounding career and at the height of his creative powers, depicting post-war Germany as a land of repressed memory and surging capitalism, repressively avoiding any connection to the horrors of its Nazi past. Women were Fassbinder's conduit to analyzing the BDR (Bundesrepublik Deutchland) and its effect on the German character, resulting in three of the most remarkable female characters ever committed to film.As noted in an affectionate commentary track by Fassbinder's friend and fellow director Wim Wenders,The Marriage of Maria Braun(1979) is Fassbinder's undisputed masterwork, a critical and box-office triumph that fulfilled Fassbinder's goal of creating a \"German Hollywood melodrama\" in the tradition of his director-hero, Douglas Sirk. Beautifully shot by Michael Ballhaus (who advanced to brilliant collaborations with Martin Scorsese), it stars Hanna Schygulla in her signature role as a newlywed whose missing husband returns in the mid-'50s, just as she's reinventing herself through opportunism, seduction, and blind ambition--a woman, like Germany, determined to forget her miserable past, with explosively tragic results. \"BRD 2\" is the wickedly satiricalVeronika Voss(1982), filmed in black and white (a stylistic nod to German'y's post-war thrillers) and starring Rosel Zech as a faded film star-turned-morphine addict making futile attempts to revive her career. Set in 1957,Lola(\"BRD 3,\" 1981) is Fassbinder's homage to Josef von Sternberg'sThe Blue Angel, and stars Barbara Sukowa as a cabaret singer and prostitute who, like Maria Braun, is for sale to the highest bidder--in this case a straight-laced official (Armin Mueller-Stahl) who discovers the high cost of ignorance.Taken together, these films form an impressively coherent vision, compassionate and yet brutally honest, unsentimental, and provocatively critical of post-war Germany. In the established tradition of the Criterion Collection, extensive supplements explore the depth of Fassbinder's achievement. Three commentaries, each with their own uniquely personal and/or critical perspective, are among the finest Criterion has ever recorded. Interviews with Schygulla, Zech, Sukowa, and many of Fassbinder's closest collaborators pay latter-day tribute to Fassbinder and his extended family of on- and off-screen talent, while the 96-minute German TV documentaryI Don't Just Want You to Love Meexplores Fassbinder's tragically curtailed life and work through abundant film clips and interviews. A filmed 1978 interview with Fassbinder himself--at 49 minutes, the longest ever recorded--offers further insight into the psychology and chain-smoking intensity of a man who burned out from drugs and exhaustion at the age of 37. Along with the collectedAdventures of Antoine Doinel, theBRD Trilogyis one of the most impressive DVD sets ever released, and a sparkling jewel in Criterion's crown.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000VARC2S", "B00HVOFP6W", "B0007WFYC0", "B000FVGNSM", "B00005QAPJ", "B000FWGYU8", "B00HE010QM", "B000PKG6O4", "B0001ZIYDO", "B00004Z1FM", "B00CUKTHDO", "B00009Y3OK", "B002U6DVQ2", "B000065AZ9", "B00HVOFP08", "B000093NQY", "B0046ZYEVG", "B000QXDFRQ", "B002BWP4A6", "B003ULW74S", "B00005B1ZK", "B004ALIG4W", "B00005A8TU", "B0002JP2OS", "B0019X3ZZO", "B000059H7Q", "B00K5EJHGO", "B000093NR0", "B00HE011DE", "B001CW7ZSA", "B00GPPXNEE", "B00005JKGX", "B0081GLD0G", "B00GA9F2PI", "B002EBRFCY", "B00180R06I", "B000OVLBGC", "B00JGR3M26", "B001WLMOHI", "B00GBT62PQ", "B000BC8SWE", "B00005JKPT", "0780020707", "1559408944", "B00IGK6TGU", "0780022629", "B004WPYO7E", "B000TXNDVG", "B001PYD0KW", "B001EP8EL2", "B00F98FOI6", "B004ALIG4M", "B00092ZLEY", "B00005A8TV", "B002IVDLGY", "B001O549FM", "B00I4X8KU2", "B000065AZB", "B004JOBATI", "B0000C2IV9", "B004WPYO6U", "B0009WIE8Y", "B003N2CVRC", "B00GPPXNQ2", "B0002VEVDO", "B00004W457", "B00GPPXNIK", "B000HT3QBE", "0780021541", "B0047P5FSQ", "B000XQ4HQO", "B001TIQT7A", "B004CIIXFA", "B00004ZBVO", "B0000633SC", "B004KVXC64", "B00A8QDHYW", "B0011U3OA6", "B00000F7E6", "B001LMU1C8", "B00I116MZ2", "B0068CEGFY", "B005HK13OK", "B0019X400I", "B00AIBZLHS", "B000C8Q900", "0780023161", "B00F98FNNM", "B000NOK0HG", "B000OPPADS", "B005HK13T0", "B002IVDLH8", "B004TJ1H1E", "B001CW7ZT4", "B00DZP1BUU", "B00GPPXP6A", "B000I8OOG0", "B001BEK8BU", "B009RWRIMA", "B00006LPER"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000VARC2S", "B000GRU8TK", "B000HOJF5U", "B000FVGNSM"]}, "price": 97.96, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 184933}, "asin": "B0000AKY56", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/418TEE3E0XL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The BRD Trilogy (The Marriage of Maria Braun / Veronika Voss / Lola) (The Criterion Collection)"}

{"description": "Director Robert Duvall (THE APOSTLE) weaves the disparate worlds of murder and dance in this quirky and sometimes impressionistic comedy drama. John (Robert Duvall), an old-school Coney Island-area hit man, is offered a lucrative job in Argentina. He doesn't really want to take it, and his reluctance to leave his beloved stepdaughter Jenny (Katherine Micheaux Miller) and miss her birthday party fuels his obstinacy. But, assured he will be back in time, he takes the job. Once in Buenos Aries, the assassination plot begins to unfold, then sputter, and finally falls apart as the target fails to show up. Needless to say, John misses Jenny's big day, and to get his mind off of things, he catches a traditional Argentinean tango performance. With a reverence for American dance, John is totally blown away by this thrillingly expressive form, and infiltrates the tango circuit through Manuela (Luciana Pedraza), a glowing but modest partner. She and her sister escort John through the history and motion that is tango, while in the meantime the assassination plot picks back up as the target finally returns to Buenos Aries. Much like the dance it depicts, the film navigates between one world of murderous intrigue and conspiracy, and the other of sensual elegance and high-art aesthetics. Duvall also bridges the gulf between these worlds with an inimitable performance", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 351572}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.61, "brand": "", "asin": "B0000DI880", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/418DP7PK5KL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Assassination Tango (Slip) [VHS]"}

{"description": "Averyatypical mother-daughter relationship is at the center ofGilmore Girls, a comedy-drama that immediately set itself apart from the herd with smarter-than-smart dialogue and an endearing mix of whimsical comedy and family drama. Set in the Capra-esque burg of Stars Hollow, where everybody knows everyone and eccentrics abound,Gilmore Girlswas less a mother-daughter show and more of a screwball buddy comedy in which the two buddies happened to be parent and child. Pregnant at 16, Lorelai (Lauren Graham) left her rich parents to bring up her daughter Rory (Alexis Bledel) on her own terms; when Rory herself turns 16, Lorelai wants to send her academically gifted daughter to the prestigious Chilton school. The catch is, Lorelai can't afford it on her own, and rather than let Rory go without, the elder Gilmore girl brokers an uneasy truce with her parents (Edward Herrmann and Kelly Bishop), who finally get a chance to bond with their granddaughter while financing her education.It sounds like a premise potentially fraught with angst and trauma, but in realityGilmore Girlswas one of the freshest, airiest, most enjoyable shows to air on the perpetually melodramatic WB network, critically praised once viewers got hooked on its unique brand of humor. Rory's growing-up adventures, including her acclimation to snooty Chilton and romance with townie dreamboat Dean (Jared Padalecki), gave the show a teen-friendly feel, butGilmore Girlswas anchored in the adult by the luminous Graham, a brilliant comedic leading lady who could turn dramatic on a dime and never break stride. The show's hallmark was its rat-a-tat, whipsmart dialogue, delivered perfectly by Graham and Bledgel, as well as a host of wacky supporting characters who would go on to become invaluable cast members. The first season allowed the show--and its lead actresses--to bloom gracefully and establish a deep, humorous rapport that lent itself perfectly to weekly travails both comedic and dramatic.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002BJGYU8", "B002BJGYTY", "B002BJGYTO", "B002BJGYV2", "B000G1R4SY", "B000N6TYLW", "B00B1LKXV8", "B00008AOX3", "B0002I838Q", "B00006JIBS", "B0006Q93BA", "B000HWZ4IE", "B009MA9ZW8", "B00005JNEQ", "B0006FFRBG", "B0000E5NPY", "B004GJYRFA", "B0077PTWY6", "B00B5AAW52", "B003TY2SWC", "B004STBF2G", "B0009W5J4Q", "B001FB4VZ8", "B00A8KJN8M", "B000B5XOW0", "B00005JO9J", "B004STBF5S", "B00004RFCM", "B0002V7TZQ", "B0009K7QZ8", "B0009JE57G", "B000GYI32M", "B000XS3EFW", "B003SNJO5S", "B000YAA2SQ", "B004STBFPS", "B008FTX6MM", "B00005JLFT", "B00382S9UA", "0783235070", "B000R9YLKY", "B001ECDVK4", "B00006ZXSK", "B00AOCZOLO", "B000AYELVA", "B00684J49U", "B000NA2BEU", "B00AEBBAEK", "0061733512", "B009LDD4BO", "B005IA9JQ8", "B005IA9JQI", "B00AEFYM2S", "B009LDCXNY", "B005IA9JRM", "B00EIXWMII", "B00AEFXXMI", "B00008YGRU", "B002VWNIAY", "B002ZG988M", "1451666179", "B000NDEXK2", "B002JVWQSW", "B000W91RUG", "B004LWZW4M", "014242417X"], "bought_together": ["B002BJGYU8", "B002BJGYTY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B006WZIAHM", "B00B5AAW52", "B002BJGYTY", "B00B1LKXV8"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 9162}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 19.95, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B0001CCXZW", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51oCGP2ik5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Gilmore Girls: Season 1"}

{"description": "For the second season, the creators of the British mystery seriesCampionhave cranked up the adventure and derring-do. The  deceptively bookish 1930s sleuth Albert Campion (Peter Davison, also a  formerDoctor Who) and his formerly thuggish manservant Lugg (Brian Glover)  dive into four two-part stories that start modestly and cleverly escalate  to high suspense. InSweet Danger, Campion must prove that a  cheerful trio of siblings are the heirs to a tiny Balkan kingdom that's  suddenly become politically significant; along the way are a mysterious  millionaire and hints of witchcraft.Dancers in Mourningstarts  with petty vandalism at a musical comedy revue but builds to an awful  bombing--even Campion, who normally views murder with relish, is  disturbed.Flowers for the Judgeis the least exotic of the  lot--the entire story takes place in London as Campion investigates a  murder in a publishing firm--but the tightly wound plot is possibly the  best of the season. The final piece,Mystery Mile, features a hedge  maze, a disappearing judge, quicksand, conjuring tricks gone awry, a  rooftop rescue, and a nefarious criminal mastermind. Even better, these  juicy set-ups are carried out with delightful skill; the writers and  directors have tightened everything up, with utterly seductive results.  Even when the conclusion feels a little lacking, getting there is great  fun. The only complaint might be a shortage of the ever enjoyable Lugg,  who plays too small of a role in a couple of the shows.--Bret  Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00008DDXE", "B000062XDX", "B00BDSRM4K", "B001HZ4K80", "B00IK481FO", "B00JJRLFTU", "B0006Q93EW", "B00A8KJLPM", "B00GWXI2RM", "B00A0HT99G", "B00HYZ0ZLS", "B00GWXI20E", "B00GHH9I62", "B000CCD1SO", "B00HHYF548", "B00HHYF55C", "B00GWXI1F0", "B00IBKXP8A", "B00A27O5AW", "B00EV1YZD2", "B00GAXASK8", "B002TY78PU", "B00199PPCO", "B009DS5OEM", "B00AATFJKC", "B000068UE9", "B00GWXI16O", "B00GD7UMDO", "B009DS31ZG", "B008645ZXY", "B00GD7UO6E", "B00C888LOO", "B009DS6YGO", "B005SH65S6", "B0050MB3RM", "B001UWOLQG", "B00GAHJO8G", "B00IBKXQJS", "B005A1GRSI", "B00BVMX4ZY", "B0002HOERQ", "B008CYDDRS", "B0038M2SBQ", "B009D4RW96", "B00GAXASKS", "B00C12ZISE", "B009D4SFEC", "B00IT3KP96", "B009DS3VQA", "B000K7UBUM", "B006O2S63G", "B00HUAGYF8", "B00EH4KY2Y", "B002WN8IS4", "B000AOEMUU", "B00H4ZEFTQ", "B003YCI1UC", "B00GWXHYPI", "B003O97W2I", "B00KCA32P8", "B00BVMXARG", "B0049S1NW8", "B00BQXTCVS", "B004HHX9H8", "B005DVIPY4", "B00GWXI2MC", "B00BCXW106", "B00D7AM2PQ", "B000199JJS", "B00FPPQYXM", "B00AO1RKFS", "B002MUAXJY", "B00A27OJ94", "B00HGE90Z4", "B00HHYF5DE", "B00HYZ10RQ", "B000CRR36K", "B003YCI238", "B00K6DQGC2", "B000A0GYN2", "B0050N0US4", "B005GP7EVC", "B0053O8AGY", "B000PC6YUS", "B00D49YDR0", "B00J3M54AW", "B008OTTTP6", "B009YX8MKO", "B00BEZEDNU", "B00GWXI28Q", "B007T40GOK", "B00ECXJC1E", "B00D49YDDY", "B00CEBJC84", "B00GD7UO4G", "B00CEBJCF2", "B00D7AM2GA", "B00GAHG7PE", "B006JY3OBI", "B001D7T6N6"], "bought_together": ["B00008DDXE", "B000062XDX"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00008DDXE", "B00BDSRM4K", "B000062XDX", "B001HZ4K80"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 58912}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 51.62, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B0001DMUF4", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518Y7BJDY1L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Campion - The Complete Second Season"}
{"description": "Providing a unique opportunity for the appreciation of Yasujiro Ozu's signature style, Criterion's definitive double-feature ofA Story of Floating Weeds(1934) andFloating Weeds(1959) demonstrates the evolution of a master. Drawing inspiration from the now-obscure 1928 American carnival-troupe dramaThe Barker, Ozu first madeA Story of Floating Weedsas a silent film (despite the advent of sound by that time), and Criterion's DVD features a sublime, newly recorded original score that sounds and feels like it's been part of the film all along. The film itself concerns a traveling Kabuki troupe faced with dramatic revelations as they perform in a rural village: Their master has had a son from a former lover whom he is visiting for the first time in a dozen years. Unaware of his parentage, the now-grown son thinks the visitor is his rarely seen uncle, and the master's mistress, upon discovering her lover's secret family, plots to undermine their relationship by urging a young actress to seduce the son, knowing that this would enrage the master's discreet familial pride. By story's end, all of these central relationships will undergo deep and resonant change.Ozu was justifiably proud of this meticulous character study, in which his celebrated low-angle style began to assert itself. A quarter-century later, he remade the film asFloating Weeds, retaining the same story and characters, switching the setting to a seaside town, and demonstrating a more casual acceptance of human foibles that makes the 1959 version (Ozu's first film in color) relatively calm and compassionate when contrasted with the more turbulent tone of the '34 silent. Having grown as an artist, Ozu was at his stylistic peak here, having refined his style to the point where all camera movement had given way to flawless refinement of static compositions. These and other comparisons abound in the study of original and remake; to that end, commentaries by preeminent Japanese film expert and dialogue translator Donald Richie (on the '34 film) and film critic Roger Ebert (onFloating Weeds) provide astutely thorough appreciations of the parallel structures, stylistic evolution, and cultural specifics of films that, until the early 1970's, were considered \"too Japanese\" for an international audience. Never dry or pretentious, their scholarly analyses lend solid, sensitive context to the enjoyment of two of Ozu's most critically and commercially successful films.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000OPPAF6", "B001BEK8CE", "B003ICZW7S", "B00026L7MC", "B00005JLV7", "B000EOTWIS", "B0012Z3630", "B00EO2I6W4", "B000BB14I0", "0780023307", "B00094AS6I", "B006X96PBU", "0520032772", "B00A8QDHYW", "B00004W3HF", "B000AQKUD6", "B000BB14IA", "6305257450", "B00CEIOH8C", "B00092ZLEY", "B000NOK0H6", "B001CW7ZTE", "B00IGK6T9W", "B000KRNGNQ", "B005D0RDPM", "B0019X400S", "B00B2BYXWM", "7885729117", "B0026VBOJM", "B000067IY6", "B00019JR5Y", "B000AQKUG8", "B00005BHW6", "B00J2PQYG8", "B00J2PQZRQ", "B00005B1ZL", "B00005JLMU", "B001C0I608", "B00003CXUM", "B00HE01030", "B00AQ6J3AG", "B0001UZZSG", "B00F98FNNM", "B001LMU19G", "B00B2BYXSQ", "B0000A02TW", "B00A8QDI3M", "B0009WIE2A", "B000305ZYS", "6305081034", "B00JC9SWSC", "B00IGK6TGU", "B00GA9F2PI", "B004NWPY20", "B000C8Q900", "B00CEIOHPU", "B00GBT62N8", "B000PKG6O4", "B005152C7S", "B00HVOFP08", "B00HRISNPM", "B0000BWVCR", "0780022343", "B001LMU1C8", "B00005M2C7", "B001BEK8E2", "B00F98FOFY", "B00004XQN5", "B00BJB2G74", "B00180R072", "B005D0RDCU", "B00HVOFP12", "B00DZP1C3Q", "B0007989Y8", "B00004Z1FM", "B00AQ6J5CC", "B007N5YJZM", "B0018Z2IJ2", "B00CUKTGQM", "B002U6DVQ2", "B000M2E3FY", "B00GPPXNEE", "B00687XNQM", "B00HE011DE", "B00129CFMY", "B00GPPXOTS", "B0007989YS", "B00005A8TV", "B00CUKTHD4", "B00005UQ7T", "B00DZP1BUU", "B00JPUURI6", "B004WPYO3I", "B000PKG6OE", "B004ALIG4M", "B000244EYW", "B00180R06I", "B004OOL73W", "B009RWRIMA"], "bought_together": ["B001BEK8CE", "B000OPPAF6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000OPPAF6", "B00EO2I6W4", "B00005JLV7", "B000EOTWIS"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 140253}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 26.49, "brand": "IMAGE ENT.", "asin": "B0001GH5RY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51XvpGDW3tL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Stories of Floating Weeds (A Story of Floating Weeds / Floating Weeds) (The Criterion Collection)"}

{"description": "No actor works harder to open a movie than Tom Cruise. His enthusiasm is throughout the DVD extras as he mirrors his samurai character by constantly talking about \"loyalty\" and \"discipline\" while working on the film. However as a post-movie experience, the top-line extras with Cruise and director Edward Zwick are repetitive and underwhelming, with too many clips from the film we assume DVD viewers have just seen. The History Channel show is also a pre-release promotional device that misses an opportunity to really dig into this intriguing time period. Better are segments on the costumes, the production design, and how you put together an Imperial army--in New Zealand, no less. Zwick's low-key and dense commentary (plus a \"Video Journal\") is not vital, but he illustrates many of the little peculiarities it took to make the wide-ranging film come together. There are two deleted scenes; a samurai's first appearance is particularly memorable.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEFY5B6", "B002O3Z50Q", "B00004XPPG", "B00AMSLDTM", "B0002YLCG0", "B0000DZTIW", "B000AARKOO", "B000QXDED6", "B003U0AHBO", "B00AEFXKUI", "B000A2WP7O", "B008MIMWOY", "B00AEBBA36", "B004AOECXI", "6305692688", "B000MGB6NM", "B0000TANUI", "079283366X", "B00005JL78", "B000W1SZBS", "B004SIP88Y", "B0034G4P58", "B001TUZG4K", "B00AS1Q93S", "B000MRA592", "B00001ZWUS", "B000E5N6LG", "B000XR9L50", "B0001HLVS2", "B00HEPDGKA", "B003ASLJO0", "B00AEBB9NM", "B000P0J0EW", "B0000A2ZNX", "B00005JNTI", "B0018QPPXW", "B000065U1N", "B000095WW8", "B0002WZTOI", "B002VWNIEA", "B004U7MQWY", "B002VWNID6", "B008JFUO36", "B00AEBB86A", "B00005JN0W", "B0007Q6VXC", "B001LRJH0U", "B000MZHW40", "B0002IQMAM", "B00004WG2F", "B003INBO3I", "B000EHRVMY", "B000NOKFHQ", "B000P0J0EM", "B00AEFXVCU", "B000YENUI6", "B000M341QE", "B0000YEEGM", "B001680M26", "B008R65XYC", "B002ZG99QS", "B00008K76U", "B000HRMAPE", "B007TBKAXK", "B00000G3PA", "0767810856", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B00AEFXYJA", "B002T9H2LA", "B000P0J0AG", "B00003CXZ1", "B000O599YO", "B000FS9FCG", "6304711905", "B00AEFXRRO", "B000HRMAUY", "B001ILHY1I", "B002NZK5V4", "B002VWNICC", "B000VKL6ZM", "B001UDS4BS", "B002ZG997C", "B004SIP8ZM", "0800177967", "B0001O3YD0", "B00005ATZT", "B004XFZ3UU", "B00004Z4WR", "B005LAIH2W", "B0007TKNGA", "B00000JQB5", "B0012Q732O", "B002ZG97RE", "B0002VEUV2", "0800141741", "B002ZG977Y", "B00005N5S3", "B00008G8M4", "B0000B1OFL"], "bought_together": ["B00AEFY5B6", "B00004XPPG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000QXDED6", "B00BEJL6JK", "B00AEFXXMI", "B00JU949TK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 121880}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 17.25, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B0001JXOUS", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51EdSWs9r9L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Last Samurai (Full Screen Edition)"}

{"description": "Allowing for all the low-budget shortcomings that plague any straight-to-video production,Starship Troopers 2: Hero of the Federationserves up 92 minutes of passable sci-fi action. Parlaying his veteran status as an animator, special-effects wizard, and stalwart survivor of the CGI revolution, Phil Tippett (with returning screenwriter Ed Neumeier) makes a woefully uninspired directorial debut with this makeshift sequel to Paul Verhoeven's 1997blockbuster, retaining the jarhead militarism of Robert Heinlein's original novel while serving up more bugs, an all-new cast of attractive young stars, and all-too-familiar plot elements borrowed from a dozen better movies. \"Bigger is better\" is out of the question under such meager budgetary circumstances, so Tippett and Neumeier compensate with gruesome bugfights and gross-out effects at regular intervals, some standard-issue nudity, and escalating paranoia (echoing Carpenter'sThe Thing) when a new breed of bugs use human hosts (&agrave; laThe Hidden) to overtake a stranded platoon of Federation soldiers on a bug-infested planet. Relying on murky confinement to hide nondescript sets,Troopers 2has three engaging leads in its favor: TV regular Richard Burgi is solidly cast as the titular hero (he's the military equivalent ofPitch Black's Riddick); Colleen Porch is engaging as the most sensible Federation survivor; and screen veteran Ed Lauter makes the most of his salty role as a battle-hardened general.

{"description": "Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore star together for the first time since The Wedding Singer in one of the funniest romantic comedies in years.  Henry (Sandler) lives an enviable life in a Hawaiian paradise, spending every night with a beautiful tourist in search of an island fling.  It's a sweet life with no strings attached...until he meets Lucy (Barrymore).  He and Lucy hit it off from the get-go, but the next day she acts like she doesn't know him.  Has his karma come around to kick him in the butt or what?  Actually, Lucy has short-term memory loss so every night all memory of her day is erased.  But a man in love will go to any lengths to win over the girl of his dreams, and if that means having to find imaginative ways of doing it over again every day, then Henry's up for the challenge.  Rob Schneider (Big Daddy) and Sean Astin (The Lord of the Rings trilogy) co-star in 50 First Dates, which will win you over every time you watch it!", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000ELJAEM", "B00000K3UU", "B00005JL93", "B003Y5H524", "B008R65XTC", "B000HT386M", "630529142X", "B00005JM4Q", "B006LL3WP2", "B00006ZXSL", "B000A0GP0Y", "B000957O82", "B00006ZXSK", "B002ZG97TW", "B00018D60C", "B00AEFY99O", "B001FB55MG", "B000VXWX7E", "B002K0WBXW", "B0090SI53C", "B0006GANPA", "B0007OCG56", "B002PLPQLU", "B0000C8ROV", "B0009X761E", "6304765266", "B00K2CHRWK", "B00003CXSM", "B00005JPE3", "B00AEFXO8Q", "6305236569", "B005LAIGSM", "B000MQC9H4", "B000YDBPAM", "B008RNYMG0", "0783227345", "B00007E2F5", "B0015I2RT8", "B000YAA68C", "B00006FMUW", "B00AKGG6JS", "B004P7CNZ4", "B0006GANOQ", "B000J103OI", "0783235070", "B0012KJ0DK", "B00003CXPS", "B000098XQ8", "B002ZG97B0", "B000Z8GZYW", "B003B3V0N4", "B0000DIXDR", "B00AEFY0F2", "B000QFCCR8", "B0045HCJRG", "B001TUZD8O", "B0000AOV4I", "B0019PL2RA", "B004EPZ070", "B000U1ZV8A", "B002ZG97QK", "B00005JMW7", "B002ZG989G", "B000683VI4", "B004SIP9RO", "B002ZGW92E", "B0002VYOVI", "B00E8RKHWW", "B000HEWEE4", "B00005JLQT", "B00005O5CM", "B003Y5H574", "B0021L8V3Y", "B00AEFYM2S", "B000A3XYIM", "B004SIP8JI", "B001C5LLQ4", "B000CEV3KU", "B004GJYRKK", "B001OQCUYI", "B003BV8ICC", "B00004Z4WR", "B002ZG998G", "B00008G8M4", "B000A0GXRO", "076780421X", "B000EOTW0Q", "B003NHRIVQ", "B00005JG6N", "1573625574", "B00062IVN0", "B002ZG988M", "B00C1LIYWM", "B002BIULKS", "B000J3OTSM", "B002U4UYZA", "B001O5LVPI", "B001C0JCBA", "B004UXUX4Q", "B002ZG984Q"], "bought_together": ["B000ELJAEM", "630529142X"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000ELJAEM", "B000AMJG4E", "B00006ZXSL", "B003Y5H524"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 65988}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.9, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B0001Z3TX4", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518NPZKNKBL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "50 First Dates (Full Screen Special Edition)"}
{"description": "Some crowded Parisian atmosphere and the burnished presence of Omar Sharif make this coming-of-age tale a pleasure. It's the early 1960s, and an adolescent Jewish boy (Pierre Boulanger), mostly left to his own devices by an ineffectual father, makes friends with the worldly wise Persian man (Sharif) who runs a small neighborhood grocery. The kid's fumbling experiences with sexual curiosity are the reliable stuff of many a French movie, but the unlikely friendship of young Jew and old Muslim make for an offbeat through-line. Francois Dupeyron's film shifts gears in its final section, moving from its flavorful location and into the wide-open spaces, and it goes on too long with too many pieces of advice. But overall this is a warm and winning experience, with Omar Sharif holding an instructive class in the power of understated movie-star charisma.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002AG2NTI", "B0084O26SI", "B0007A61K6", "B00IKM5OCO", "B004ZBFRRG", "B0009P7EI2", "B000811672", "B0087IT8FK", "2226126260", "B00421IR5I", "B0000C9JFO", "B000296E7W", "2806213827", "B0002C4JIK", "B001THZAAI", "B00HW3EWQQ", "B000B58DHQ", "B001AZJKKK", "B0069UV0AY", "B003Y7D7BU", "B0001IN0MQ", "B00GMV8B1G", "B0001XALGY", "B001M72J68", "B000UAE7MM", "1590510917", "B00ATK0452", "B002U4F5W2", "6305132917", "B001AMH7XA", "B00CEIOGZG", "B00HUQCA28", "B000YAA68W", "B00005JNCZ", "1609451228", "B0002J4X20", "B000HIVIQU", "B00HRJVHEK", "B00FF9SKQW", "B00GSBMNOQ", "0413775909", "B00GHP8SH4", "B000ECX0O2", "B0002S64SM", "B000NVT0RU", "B000M9BPG2", "B005CKW8BM", "B00EI2CUN6", "B0000A1HQP", "B000N3T0DW", "B002O3Z4WU", "B000YPUFBA", "B007I1Q59E", "B0087OULO6", "B008220DGE", "B00000F7E6", "B009CSVQ8Q", "B005V4X8PO", "B000T0XEGS", "B00APOH5OA", "B00005JNC2", "B0002TSZMO", "B000053VBR", "B000UVV26A", "B004SEUIXS", "B00AIBZLHS", "2070368076", "B000062XE6", "B00166UFTS", "2210754674", "B002BWP3UC", "B00CD6VY6S", "B005HFI7IU", "B000OVLBGC", "B000E1ZBFY", "B00AKGG5WG", "B00AEFYSWM", "B000FVQLRA", "B00320J6WS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001THZAAI", "B00421IR5I", "2226126260", "B0009P7EI2"]}, "price": 20.95, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 139917}, "asin": "B00023GG6C", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51TBKZFAJ7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Monsieur Ibrahim"}

Trouble is, he  can't keep out of trouble, and when he does stay clean, trouble finds  him--in this case, in the bikini-clad form of Nancy (Sara Foster), the  mistress of a local developer who gets turned on by the whiff criminal  activity. She lures Jack into a scheme that ultimately involves a solid  cast including Morgan Freeman, Charlie Sheen, Gary Sinise, Bebe Neuwirth,  Willie Nelson, and more.

{"description": "Almost by accident, these five Warner Brothers films represent key moments in Martin Scorsese's career. Three of the films debut on DVD; all have excellent presentations plus new commentaries from Scorsese. The black-and-whiteWho's That Knocking at My Door?(1968) was Scorsese's first film, an episodic tale of growing up in Little Italy.Mean Streets(1973) put him on the map. After taking a bit of Hollywood bait (Boxcar Bertha), mentor John Cassavetes put Scorsese straight to find his true vision, and this nervy look at New York friends who border the gangster life is the result. This new special edition has the commentary track and a big improvement in its home video presentation.Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore(1974) put Scorsese in the mainstream. This tale of a single mom (Ellen Burstyn in an Oscar-winning performance) finding second chances in the arid Southwest proved the New York City kid could tell other types of stories.After Hours(1985) saved Scorsese. The drain of big movies and his unsuccessful first attempt to makeThe Last Temptation of Christleft the auteur doubting his talent. The nightmarish comedy starting Griffin Dunne is a love-it-or-leave-it for many Scorsese fans, but the fast shoot schedule and claustrophobic story rejuvenated Scorsese and won him Best Director kudos at Cannes. The highlight of the collection is a two-disc edition of his masterpiece,GoodFellas(1990), complete with a remastered print and a dynamite commentary by several key talents (recorded separately) including Ray Liotta, author Nicholas Pileggi, and even Robert De Niro. Even with an extra disc of three featurettes, it's the film on which we hear the least from the man himself, but perhaps all we need to know is on the screen.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00062IVL2", "0767830555", "B00006RCNV", "B004O724M2", "B0002ZSKMS", "6305941122", "B000UJCAKO", "B0006GAOJA", "B000WC39ZY", "B001JQTSG6", "B000V3JGII", "B00BTYMPX6", "B000C20VPA", "B0031P77RU", "0307268403", "B007NYZA0Q", "B004499LWG", "B006TTC5MM", "B004IFYMYI", "6305090580", "B00005UM2Y", "B000035Z5G", "B000CNESUS", "B000HWZ4ES", "B00553K8FY", "B004SIP7TE", "B005EVY8MQ", "B0000DI87S", "B00008RH3J", "0571220029", "B005CA4SL0", "B000UVV25Q", "B00080ZG10", "B005KQVE1S", "B00005QAPH", "B002QEHPQ0", "B000A2UBN4", "B000M341QE", "B00005ASUK", "B0018CMJSU", "B00AEFXN9G", "B00003CWTI", "B0024FAG2Q", "B002T9H2LA", "B0007RTBA6", "B004SIP7US", "B000CNESTE", "B00005YKXQ", "B007TBJD1U", "6305999872", "B0011HOEZS", "B000A0GP4K", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00000F3CD", "B00AEBB9CS", "B003102JDM", "0783225903", "B000E40QC4", "B00005NC66", "B008220DGE", "B00005JKFX", "B001539HQY", "B002U6DVPS", "B003XTOBU0", "B000CNESU8", "B000SFJ4IQ", "B004FQX5B6", "B00009ME9Z", "B0001MDQ9E", "B00008975Z", "B001BEK8E2", "B001FOK70S", "B00F98FNNM", "B000BX0VRS", "B0002JP2OS", "B00AEBBA68", "B000244EWY", "B0024EWP6W", "B00005ATQB", "0226182037", "0307388794", "B000LP6KNU", "B0009S4IJM", "B003S6KGNY", "B00004XPPB", "B000E6ESXK", "B000286RNE", "B0070HKDMG", "B0000AZT2X", "B00004Y87O", "B000CEV3L4", "B001152TL6", "B006TTC5HC", "B001QFFBAM", "B002QFYJF4", "B00H9KKKAY", "B007D0FVRM", "B000E0OE1M", "B000E5LEV0", "B00005UQ7T"], "bought_together": ["0767830555"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0767830555", "B000P0J09M", "B0006GAOJA", "B000C20VPA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 31888}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 21.0, "brand": "SCORSESE,MARTIN", "asin": "B000286RR0", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51KybRrNkXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Martin Scorsese Collection (After Hours/Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore/Goodfellas/Mean Streets/Who's That Knocking At My Door?)"}

{"description": "Federico Fellini's breakthrough film, the 1953I Vitelloni, is one of the cinema's seminal stories about slacker males, and a highly entertaining one at that. Following the unfortunate failure of his comedyThe White Sheik, Fellini prepared to shootLa Strada(he would release that early masterpiece in 1954), but decided at the last minute to make an autobiographical feature about mischievous, drifting, 30-ish losers in a small, seaside town.I Vitelloniclicked with international audiences and remains an obvious influence on such later classics asBreaking AwayandDiner. But there's nothing like Fellini's almost self-mocking fusion of gritty neo-realism with the audacious, illusionary style he would later be entirely linked. The ensemble comedy follows the ever-diminishing fortunes of five young men who can't define, let alone jump-start, their dreams, particularly the caddish Fausto (Franco Fabrizi), who thinks nothing of molesting the wife of his father-in-law's best friend.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001LMU1C8", "B000G8NXYQ", "B00000IOKV", "B00005V6N6", "B00005JKGO", "6305081034", "B00005QAPH", "B00009ME9Z", "B00005BHW6", "B00008H2GS", "B000059H9B", "0780022270", "B0007M222A", "B002U6DVQ2", "B004D8P24E", "B004ODLUIU", "B006MHZ32K", "B001WLMOOG", "B000059H9C", "B000JYW5AU", "B004M66YUS", "B0009HLCTC", "B00L3ZB7JO", "B00005BCJZ", "B0007989Y8", "B00DZP1BUU", "B000093NR1", "B005STRKQK", "B003VA3JTK", "B00JPUUSEE", "6305908486", "B00KE3B6NI", "B00HRJVHEK", "B004CGUC06", "B006MHZ46A", "B00598OA2C", "B000I0RNV6", "B0012KOM6K", "B00KE3B6LA", "B000AQKUG8", "B0011U3OA6", "B004R4PWYY", "B00012L786", "B00KE3B6LU", "B001NH4CIA", "B000BC8SWO", "B0006Z2NB8", "B002U6DVQM", "6305257450", "B00152VXUI", "B00HE010QM", "B000CR8QV6", "B0000633SD", "B004N084S8", "B00005JLMU", "B00782O7LG", "B003VA3JTA", "B0001ZIVAA", "B0007989ZC", "B00DZP1C3Q", "B004P0IRHE", "B000FUF7D0", "B0000BUZKP", "B004CIIXDC", "B00005NC66", "B000E3L7L4", "B00003CXUM", "B001BEK8BU", "B000BR6QCS", "B001LMU19G", "B000C8Q900", "B000093NR2", "B004OOL73W", "B00GBT637S", "B00F98FOFY", "B00J2PQZRQ", "B0000YEEHG", "B004WPYO7E", "B00HVOFP62", "B000093NR0", "B00J2PQYY0", "B00005JLV7", "B001WLMOLE", "B000IHYXH6", "B0000D0YVM", "B00IGK6TOM", "B001BSBBIK", "B000EOTWIS", "B00DHN8GGW", "B005152CB4", "B00EO2I6W4", "B005152C7S", "B00F98FOI6", "B00005UQ7Q", "B005KQVE1S", "B000BC8SWE", "B008A1AKK6", "B00HVOFP6W", "B005152CBE", "B003ICZW8M"], "bought_together": ["B001LMU1C8", "6305081034"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00598OA2C", "B00005V6N6", "B001LMU1C8", "6305081034"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 53302}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 20.83, "brand": "INTERLENGHI,FRANCO", "asin": "B0002DB4YQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51TAaC4yvTL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "I Vitelloni (The Criterion Collection)"}

{"description": "It's reassuring to know Lars von Trier was always unconventional.Epidemic, von Trier's second feature, comes close to being a horror movie, except it keeps derailing itself to noodle while a director (played by von Trier) and screenwriter (screenwriter Niels Vorsel) improvise a scenario about a plague epidemic. Their struggles are shot in grainy 16 mm., while flashes of the intended film are in stunning 35.Epidemicis meandering enough to test the patience of even devoted von Trier fans, but it always looks good even when it looks bad, if that makes any sense, and the finale--which involves hypnotism, one of the Danish director's early obsessions--will give a chill to genre fans looking for a \"gotcha.\" Von Trier regular Udo Kier pops up, and the film wouldn't be complete without its logo:  the title branded onto the upper-left corner for most of the movie.

{"description": "Truth, identity, and responsibility are the cornerstones ofSmallville's exceptional third season. When viewers left Clark (Tom Welling) at the end ofseason 2, he was feeling his oats in Metropolis with the help of a red Kryptonite ring, but by the opening of season 3, he must return to Smallville to not only help his parents save their farm, but seek some resolution in his relationships with Lana (Kristin Kreuk) and Lex (Michael Rosenbaum), who's returned from his abandonment at the conclusion of the previous season. Lex himself must deal with some shocking revelations regarding his relationship with his sinister father Lionel (John Glover, magnetic as always), and Lana becomes involved with a new figure in town, the mysterious Adam Knight (Lost's Ian Somerholder), who may or may not be a certain caped crusader. And speaking of heroes in disguise, the season's finale introduces Kara, a young woman with powers similar to Clark's--could she in fact be his sister, known best to comic book fans as Supergirl? Season 3 is chock full of such intriguing moments, including an appearance by futureDaily Planeteditor Perry White (Michael McKean, the real-life husband of series star Annette O'Toole) in \"Perry,\" helmed bySupergirlfilm director Jeannot Szwarc; the return of villains Jonathan Taylor Thomas, Shawn Ashmore, and Jesse Metcalfe from seasons 1 and 2 (in \"Asylum\"); the departure of series regular Samuel L. Jones; and a intrigue-fraught final turn by Christopher Reeve as Dr. Swann (\"Legacy\").The boxed set matches the high quality of the season with some terrific extras, including commentary on three episodes by series creators Alfred Gough and Miles Millar, along with Rosenbaum, Allison Mack (Chloe), and Glover. Gough and Millar also contribute commentary to a battery of deleted scenes, and Mack's \"Chloe Chronicles\" returns for another go-round. The supplemental features are rounded out by a behind-the-scenes featurette, an amusing gag reel, and an Easter egg with Rosenbaum conducting some offbeat interviews.--Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0009A5MUO", "B0001JXPPC", "B000G1R4SO", "B000N6SE4U", "B000X5SMXY", "B00005JLKB", "B001FB4VZS", "B002JVWRDQ", "B003L77GG0", "B006CR2ON6", "B000R206FK", "B001FB4W02", "B0012U7IWU", "B002JVWRE0", "B003L77GGA", "B00G4SCOJW", "B00080ZG2O", "B00G4SCKAK", "B00BBXSPCK", "B00BBXSPES", "B00BGI086Q", "B00260HH30", "B000BT96EG", "B000P6XQ50", "B004EXNHO0", "B00DTRR43W", "B001DJLD2G", "B002N5N5MK", "B00DX88IL4", "B004PHSTTS", "B000FP2OPY", "B00G7QPX6C", "B0018CWEYY", "B000J10EQU", "1419826670", "B000PE0G0A", "B00JF5G8WU", "B0000640T0", "B00CN009Y2", "B001FB4W0C", "B002DQL34G", "B00F4FFO8E", "B00280LZAE", "B000EHSVM8", "B00915G6OE", "B0049IHWYG", "B001MVWRNE", "B0041QSZ7O", "B005SH63HO", "B000SMNL92", "B008JFUPFI", "B000X5SPBI", "B002FGUHBE", "B009LDCXNY", "B005PYKVRI", "B004SEUIWY", "B00ED2IBXE", "B00066FBQQ", "B00K7IPFSM", "B0051SFSAS", "B00915G6SU", "B000BT96FA", "B000HLDF9U", "B000F8O2P6", "B000A5046K", "B000O77SMW", "B0019LY5IM", "B000F8O2OW", "B00915G6TE", "B00EIL7E9C", "B003L77GGK", "B000R7GKQE", "B00B5J6A7W", "B00K7IPGS6", "B004LROMWU", "B00DYEN6XC", "B00023E88U", "B003ITZBVS", "B000B8384G", "B000CCBC9O", "B000I0QLS2", "B009LDD626", "B0025KVKDE", "B001C8W7EQ", "B00GTZWUPS", "B0002CX1M0", "B001MVWRN4", "1401210600", "B004HW7JNS", "1401234860", "B00IYRLUAU", "B00JPS6A3O", "B0072OFM28", "B004EPZ084", "B002JVWRAO", "B00915G6NK", "B00BEJL6JK", "B00JPS7HOA", "B005QET8FS", "B00CPEK3NI"], "bought_together": ["B0009A5MUO", "B0001JXPPC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0001JXPPC", "B0009A5MUO", "B000N6SE4U", "B000G1R4SO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 10632}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 29.69, "brand": "WEA", "asin": "B0002Y0QV2", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51FG3cFcvQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Smallville: Season 3"}
{"description": "One of the first gems of the cable TV age,Faerie Tale Theatrebrings 26 classic tales to life. Produced over a five-year span (1982-87) for Showtime,FTTbrought together creative dramatics and whimsical writing with some of the top talents of the day. Executive producer/host Shelley Duvall (who was coming off her breakout role inThe Shining) shepherds this mix of theatrical simplicity and grand storytelling for these oft-told tales (\"Goldilocks and the Three Bears,\" \"Little Red Riding Hood,\" \"Hansel and Gretel,\" \"Sleeping Beauty,\" and the like) for kids and their parents. Since they are not elaborately produced,FTTmay be a hard sell for some smaller members of the family at first, but most should be hooked, even older kids who may pooh-pooh fairy tales. There's always a slight twist that makes these productions fresh.The cast is amazing, especially when you think how lightly cable television was thought of in the '80s: Jeff Bridges, Bud Cort, Liza Minnelli, James Coburn, Susan Sarandon, Christopher Reeve, Klaus Kinski, Billy Crystal, Matthew Broderick, Gregory Hines, Eric Idle, Robin Williams, and Mick Jagger are some of the talented--and varied--actors appearing. Crystal's take on the smart \"Little Pig\" (with Jeff Goldblum as the wolf) and Williams's \"Frog Prince\" are two comic gems. Malcolm McDowell, right in the middle of his career high-point of playing baddies, brings flair to the Big Bad Wolf, while his then-real-life wife Mary Steenburgen beautifully counterpoints as Red Riding Hood. The casting of Vincent Price and Vanessa Redgrave in \"Snow White\" is inspired. Also impressive are the directors Duvall pooled: Tim Burton (\"Aladdin and His Wonderful Lamp\"), Francis Ford Coppola (\"Rip Van Winkle\") Peter Medak (three episodes), Nicholas Meyer (\"Pied Piper\"), and Roger Vadim (\"Beauty and the Beast\"). You can go on for days about these wonderful tales, most totaling around the 45-minute mark, but it's better just to get the set and start wherever you'd like; you will get to the end sooner than you think.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002CLKOYM", "B000EU1Q5E", "B001O5LVQ2", "B0009UVCRG", "B0009UVCRQ", "B000FSME7O", "B001JI4UMQ", "B0009U7LO4", "B00402FGM6", "B008N8A3JE", "B0001BKBD4", "B00005RDST", "B00KS9V6EC", "B00CMDPTTA", "B0009U7LOO", "B004DTLKC6", "B0009U7LNU", "B00EQ2KVQQ", "B0009U7LNK", "B00265T7MO", "B0000DZ3EN", "B001JQHT26", "B00B04NIZO", "B001B73Q20", "B00JHH1ZN8", "B00061UHYM", "B00061UI0A", "B00000K3D4", "B000EQ5PPA", "B006HSYIVG", "B001QU880W", "B00IF0KASY", "B00FRQ0L2O", "B00068NVG6", "B004B93RDS", "B0062KMDWU", "B000A345C6", "B0000639G3", "B003A6X166", "B001PK47GW", "B0041SI78O", "076781326X", "B00CYQXFP0", "B006WNSHUY", "B00000JPH6", "B00BCMT4B6", "B00CKYHH82", "B00006RCNV", "B0001I55UQ", "B00HZMZ2HM", "B0016BPWNM", "B000S0KYTE", "B002GOAH10", "B00K5ZXKFM", "B0013ND30M", "B000NJMJGG", "B00007L4I6", "B008JFUNYG", "B002945DUW", "B00CKJJ1IG", "B002CAWNHE", "B00IYMSMTM", "B00004TJJV", "B00AO686MY", "B002HK9IDQ", "B00001PE59", "B0001I562I", "B00IF0KAYS", "B00JPS6A3O", "B00E5G03I4", "B00JF5GAZA", "B00080ZFZC", "B002DH20Q0", "B001AGXEAG", "B00004Z4SE", "B003L77GWE", "B00CYQXE10", "B009INAK8C", "6305236569", "B003VS0CX8", "B000XT1P5C", "B0009X75QU", "B000TGJ8B2", "B00CNW9ZI6", "B0009ULBGS", "B00A7OIXW6", "B00AEBB8VK", "B009INAC12", "B000055ZOB", "B002NZK5V4", "B002CLBJPK", "6305161887", "B002Z7FM68", "B00HGE90Z4", "B0000AOX0O", "B00G5G7EXY", "B00BG92NPO", "B00E9ZATKI", "B008F5IE1Y", "B00CTNYLS8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002CLKOYM", "B000FSME7O", "B00CMDPTTA", "B00061UHZG"]}, "price": 32.95, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 485559}, "asin": "B00063UEFM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/613HEQ99EZL._SX300_.jpg", "title": "The Complete Faerie Tale Theatre Collection (26 Titles)"}

{"description": "Zhang Ziyi looks as beautiful as ever inPurple Butterfly,a film that takes her out of the martial-arts world ofHeroandHouse of Flying Daggers. She plays a member of Purple Butterfly, an underground resistance group fighting against the Japanese aggression in early-1930s China. The movie's central dilemma comes when her ex-lover, a Japanese agent (Toru Nakamura), returns to Shanghai and is earmarked for assassination by Purple Butterfly. This compelling-sounding set-up is frustratingly unfulfilled, as director Ye Lou (Shuzou River) opts for an opaque brand of storytelling, in which chronology is jumbled and drama short-circuited. The film looks gorgeous, but it is close to impossible to understand what is going on at any given moment.

{"description": "Based on the beloved autobiographical novel by Elspeth Huxley, BBC miniseriesThe Flame Trees of Thikabrings an eventful childhood in Eastern Africa to vivid life. In 1913, 11-year-old Elspeth Grant (Holly Aird) traveled with her mother, Tilly (Hayley Mills), from England to Kenya to help build a coffee plantation. (Born in 1907, Huxley was actually six at the time.) Her father, Robin (David Robb), who had preceded them, was waiting to greet his family in the arid town of Thika. Also waiting for them were lions, elephants, giraffes, and countless other creatures (the 18-week production was filmed on location in Kenya).Directed by Roy Ward Baker (A Night To Remember) and written by John Hawkesworth (Upstairs, Downstairs),The Flame Trees of Thikaisn't just about one girl, or one family, adrift in an occasionally hostile foreign land, but also about the dangers of colonialism. The Grants, their neighbors, the Palmers (Nicholas Jones and Sharon Maughan), and most of the other Europeans in Thika feel certain they're bringing culture to the uncivilized, without realizing what they're destroying in the process. Ian Crawford (Ben Cross fromChariots of Fire), is one possible exception to the rule, but he brings another kind of danger in his pursuit of Mrs. Palmer.Since their actions are seen through the eyes of a child,The Flame Trees of Thikais never preachy, but the meddling of these adults--however well intentioned--in the affairs of the Masai, the Kikuyu, and other locals frequently creates tension. As Tilly notes, \"It's like two whole separate circles revolving around each other--their world and ours--and only just touching occasionally.\" What began as Elspeth's coming-of-age story, becomes one for her parents, as well, in this sensitive and engaging series.--Kathleen C.

{"description": "By getting nominated for Academy Awards in both the Foreign Language Film and Best Song categories,Les Choristes(The Chorus) made a rare (for a European film) double impression at the 2004 Oscars. This sentimental tale follows the arrival of a new teacher at a remote boys school in 1949 France (the war is a largely unspoken but ghostly presence). With disciplinary problems rampant, and the policies of the old-fashioned headmaster not helping, Monsieur Mathieu decides to introduce choral singing as a way to bridge the gap with his students. You don't need a crystal ball to figure out where this will go, although the movie uses its atmospheric location and lush vocal arrangements well. Bald, dumpy Gerard Jugnot provides a refreshingly offbeat hero (though securely in the traditions of the My Most Memorable Teacher movie); he's sort of a younger Philippe Noiret.

{"description": "Broken Lanceis a noble entry in the trend of adult Westerns of the early 1950s, scoring on a couple of fronts:  (1) as a multigenerational saga, with Shakespearian overtones, of a family bickering over a giant ranch, and (2) as a grown-up look at the dilemma of the Native American... its title perhaps inspired by the Indian-friendlyBroken Arrow? Spencer Tracy stars as the blustery patriarch of a cattle spread, threatened by pollution from a nearby copper mine as well as the shiftiness of his older sons (Richard Widmark, Hugh O'Brian, and Earl Holliman). Tracy's bluff characterization--as ever, he seems to be yanking at the script like a cat unraveling a ball of yarn--carries the film effortlessly along. The central character is actually his youngest and wisest son, played by Robert Wagner, who's not especially convincing as the mixed-race issue of Tracy's second marriage, to an Indian woman (Oscar nominee Katy Jurado). Edward Dmytryk directs in a style that could be called \"intelligent,\" which is another way of saying \"not very exciting.\" The early CinemaScope probably accounts for some of the static set-ups, although there are exteriors that are breathtaking (watching this film in its full-screen version would be crazy). The cast is certainly tops; Widmark is overqualified to play a third lead, but who's complaining? Most memorable is the loving relationship between Tracy's cattleman and his Indian wife, although the subject of Native Americans is secondary here (check outThe Devil's DoorwayandApachefor more overt Fifties looks at the topic). Veteran screenwriter Philip Yordan won an Oscar for his \"original story,\" a curious and long-defunct Academy Award category.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000OT6V0U", "B00AEFXFW6", "B000EHSVW8", "B000EHSVWS", "B000NO1XMC", "B000EHSVVY", "B000QRI1GW", "B00195I3OK", "B000G6N0HI", "B00195I3P4", "B00BTYSIV4", "B00195I3PE", "B000056H2H", "B0007PALJS", "B0014BQR1A", "B00AEBB8W4", "B0007MAO02", "B000FTCLQW", "B003RHZ666", "B0007MANYY", "B0007MANZI", "B00BTYU3UI", "B00575GYUI", "B009INAHZS", "B0007TKNH4", "B0001Z3I0I", "B008JEJSB6", "B00BTYPW8G", "B00008CMT3", "B0001FVDW8", "B002BIULMQ", "B00AEFYPHA", "B006VRRGOO", "B000031EGW", "B000N3T0GY", "B00KIZYDCI", "B000NQRR34", "B0007MANZS", "B0041ONFI0", "B00018D404", "6304696612", "B0001GF2HY", "B00000K3D5", "B004GJYRBY", "B000063UQO", "B0007QS24S", "B000BDH6DU", "B00BCMSYDU", "B00005JLV5", "B00195I3OU", "B0007MAO0C", "B00KIZY3XW", "B00005JP3X", "B008JEJPJG", "B0001FVDWS", "B00096S4BM", "B003552QXG", "B000A1OG0Y", "B007RKFXQW", "B000O599LW", "B000BT96DW", "B003552QU4", "B00008CMSY", "B00007ELD2", "B00B4HLY8K", "B00AMDA2OY", "B0006UEVVS", "B000HT38I0", "B00008CMR1", "B005AMJ31U", "B002C7ELNQ", "B00008CMSW", "B005AMJ38S", "B00008CMRL", "B004K4FUMK", "B004GSVX8A", "B000NO1XJA", "B004J2FJC4", "B00AEBB932", "B000O599NA", "B000FUH38C", "B0095Y3YHI", "B000FTCLQC", "B0082LUFA4", "B0014BQR24", "B0007PALM0", "B002XDR5N2", "B00D23GOVG", "B0001NBMHQ", "B00083FZFY", "B000056H2K", "B008A1TXX6", "B00005JLUH", "B000EHSVWI", "B0066E6RD8", "B00004TJJU", "B000M69S5A", "B002EAYDSE", "B00008MTW5", "B00BY0EBK0"], "bought_together": ["B000OT6V0U"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000OT6V0U", "B000QRI1GW", "B000056H2H", "B000G6N0HI"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 55583}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.62, "brand": "TCFHE", "asin": "B0007PALKC", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GVNJW3Q3L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Broken Lance"}

The hitch is, the starry-eyed writer-director (Matthew Broderick), cast, and crew have no idea they're part of an undercover operation--the poor saps think their ship has come in and they're actually making a movie. Adding to the joke is that Baldwin finds himself enchanted by the moviemaking world and beginning to care about his unsuspecting stooge (Broderick is at his most engaging). Writer-director Jeff Nathanson (who scriptedCatch Me if You Can) doesn't quite trust this funny set-up, sweetening the pot with too sentimental nudges, but the two stars develop a handy odd-couple chemistry. Toni Collette, as a has-been actress, and Joan Cusack, as a sharp-tongued agent, have some riotous moments.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00029LNYQ", "B006GL8MQQ", "B0002DRDBY", "B0031REQJA", "6305310335", "B00006SFK1", "B0068MNO2U", "0767810856", "B000FO0A9W", "B00DZP1C2W", "B000FFL2G6", "6305803765", "B0040J1RX6", "B0001EFV7C", "B001B7CNWE", "B002ZG977Y", "B0001US67S", "B004EPYZOO", "B001MVWFAO", "B000093FLA", "B00008AOTO", "B004A8ZWWO", "B00118T632", "B0002YLCG0", "B004HO6I2E", "B007REV4LQ", "B00BEIYLO8", "B002ZG983M", "B000FO0AA6", "B0034G4P4O", "B003UESJME"], "bought_together": ["B006GL8MQQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005LAIH4A"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 206526}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.34, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Entertainment / Touchstone", "asin": "B0007US79O", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518TYCYG6VL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Last Shot"}

{"description": "Au hazard Balthazarcan have a profoundly moving effect on those who are sensitive to its power. Like any film by Robert Bresson, it provokes widely different responses: Many critics have hailed it as a masterpiece, while others (as Pauline Kael observed) \"may find it painstakingly tedious and offensively holy.\" It all depends on what the viewer brings to Bresson's seemingly simple tale of a donkey named Balthazar, who experiences kindness and cruelty as he is passed from owner to owner. Populated by a variety of sinners and saints alike, the film can be seen as a simple animal fable, as Balthazar suffers nobly at the hands of his handlers. Dig deeper into Bresson's art, however, and you're likely to find a very Catholic story with strong parallels to the life of Christ and his unbearable burden of the sins of mankind.No matter how you approach the film, only the most cold-hearted viewer will be immune to Balthazar's fate. And if you're not sure what to make of it all, this superb Criterion DVD offers two essential bonus features to guide you toward a greater understanding of Bresson's approach to cinema: Film scholar and devoted \"Bressonian\" Donald Richie offers his astute observations in a 2004 video interview, and in an in-depth French TV appearance from 1966, Bresson talks at length aboutAu hazard Balthazaralong with fellow directors Louis Malle and Jean-Luc Godard, and members of the film's cast and crew. This is a remarkable document from a bygone era, when \"art film\" was at its peak, and directors (especially French ones) were eager to discuss the intellectual significance of their work. Kudos to Criterion for including this archival gem of film appreciation.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000BB14IA", "B000K0YLX2", "B00AQ6J6H6", "B001LMU19G", "0780022343", "B000087EY6", "6305257450", "6305744114", "B008DL4K8Q", "B00005M2C7", "B005152C7S", "B000127IF2", "B00AQ6J3AG", "B000C8Q900", "B00005JLV7", "B00EO2I6W4", "B009VO9XSG", "B001TIQT7A", "B00HE011DE", "B0007989Y8", "B000I8OOG0", "B0007OC6ZG", "B00005BHW6", "B001UF5KOU", "B0000A02TX", "B001TIQT6G", "B00GA9F2PI", "B00CUKTHJ8", "B009RWRIMA", "B0016AKSOG", "B000BB14I0", "B000N2HBIO", "B006X96PBU", "B00005UQ7T", "B000093NR0", "B00HVOFP6W", "B00005EBSF", "B00009ME9Z", "B005HK13S6", "B000BR6QIW", "B00BX49B0C", "B000AQKUG8", "B00180R06I", "B00KE3B6NI", "B001BEK8C4", "B004WPYO7E", "B00DHN8GQ2", "B00KE3B6LA", "B001LMU1C8", "B000E5LEV0", "B005152CC8", "6305131104", "B0001GH5RY", "B001ILTUKG", "B0016B6ZEC", "B002BWP4A6", "B001298BPY", "B000C8Q8ZQ", "B002U6DVQ2", "B007A9EGB8", "B00005NC66", "B004NWPY20", "B00000F7E6", "B001BEK8CE", "B00GBT629C", "B00DZP1C3Q", "B000PKG6O4", "B00A8QDHYW", "6305081034", "B002AFX53C", "B001LMU1B4", "B00HVOFP08", "B00004Z1FM", "B000EOTWIS", "B005HK13OK", "B00DZP1BUU", "B0035G5IOE", "B000M2E3GS", "B004CGUC10", "B00005QAPH", "B00005QAPJ", "B007A9EGC2", "B001WLMOL4", "B000IHYXH6", "B0000633SD", "B000HKH0WY", "B000FUF7CQ", "B000XQ4HQO", "B00JGR3M26", "B004NWPY34", "B00L3ZB7PS", "B00023P4N8", "B008CJ0JS4", "B00003CXUM", "B00GG0NABE", "B0007989ZC", "B001IZNIV4", "B005VU9LP4", "B000093NQY", "0292776241"], "bought_together": ["B000BB14IA", "B000K0YLX2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001EOQCJE", "6305428239", "B001QOGYBI", "B0000640VJ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 88549}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 20.17, "brand": "WIAZEMSKY,ANNE", "asin": "B00092ZLEY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41MLI-OZspL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Au Hasard Balthazar (The Criterion Collection)"}
{"description": "It seems that this short-lived 1977 spinoff was not so much trying to recapture the magic ofBewitchedas it wasThe Mary Tyler Moore Show. Like Mary, Lisa Hartman's Tabitha was an independent single woman working for a low-rent local television station. Where Mary had a letter \"M\" hanging on her wall, Tabitha had a \"T.\" Tabitha, however, tried to turn our world on, not with a smile, but with a twitch of her nose. And without the benefit of brilliant writers or an able ensemble, Hartman was just not up to taking a nothing premise and suddenly making it all seem worthwhile. Tabitha, now a witchy woman, works as an assistant at KXLA with her mortified mortal brother, Adam, to whom she promises to \"cut down on the nose action\" (in the more-interesting unaired pilot included on this two-disc set, Adam is a warlock trying to lure his sister to the dark side).Tabithais an exercise in diminished returns. Mel Stuart, as the beleaguered station manager, is no Ed Asner; a pre-SpenserRobert Urich, as the obnoxious, egomaniacal talk show host, is no Ted Knight; and Karen Morrow, as Tabitha's meddlesome, troublemaking aunt Minerva, is no Agnes Moorehead.Not thatTabithais without its TV Land charms. Reprising their roles from the original series are Sandra Gould and a bearded George Tobias as Gladys and Abner Kravitz in \"The Arrival of Nancy,\" and Bernard Fox as Dr. Bombay in \"Tabitha's Party.\" These episodes also feature welcome appearances by, respectively, Fred Willard as a gold-chain-wearing swinger and Werner \"Col. Klink\" Klemperer.  For undiscriminating couch potatoes,Tabitha,  may cast an irresistible guilty pleasure spell. However, fans of the original series will probably feel less bewitched than bothered and bewildered.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00DXLO086", "B00280QNKG", "B001LRTT30", "B00AIA89OQ", "B00DXLO0D6", "B0014FAIYS", "B000PISZ86", "B000HIVIOM", "B000E3L7FK", "B000ASDFIQ", "B0009B16TO", "B00GOC74RU", "B00GC2KI2U", "B00GLPYVQC", "B00G5N6C8U", "B004K63PUW", "B00JF5GAZA", "B008H6GHII", "B00IF0KAYS", "B00JAD6BYW", "B001MBTSTU", "B00AKK6LM6", "B00KU12UMU", "B00I458456", "B000ZBEOHY", "B00KYCA4QY", "B003JHXS5A", "B0055CP9MC", "B00JDCP0QA", "B008K1PX7Q", "B000E33VZ4", "B00DXLO0BI", "B00DYQ1GBE", "B00KW02JRK", "B00HW3L9MG", "B00HW3LG3S", "B00JHH1VUU", "B00GLT2SOA", "B00H8KC1N4", "B000RXZL0E", "B00JHH1VDC", "B001NRPQKI", "B005EVY8NA", "B000TD48SI", "B000A0GXGK", "B000G0O5J6", "B004M9ZI0C", "B0033PSH7W", "B005DGKBDC", "B00I099JZK", "B000ASDFGI", "B00F4CIPRE", "B00JK47BHM", "B000MGBSEY", "B00I4F0IWI", "B00KBES386", "B003W5C0TY", "B00HMOW9YM", "B00HNGC56G", "B00HXH5WNI", "B0009X7BEQ", "B00HMOWA0A", "B00BUWD7E8", "B00125WAY6", "B0089BSLKS", "B000FSMEB0", "B008X8U83K", "B00ESK1PES", "B0050MB5AC", "B00GHH9HW2", "B0007N1JYG", "B00F3L8P26", "B001P9N9B2", "B000CELOW2", "B000G0O5JG", "B000AMJG5I", "B0096RC57O", "B0012IXBNC", "B000X07SQ6", "B000JJSL7G", "B009TTGLJ2", "B000V3JGIS", "B001LRTT3A", "B007JNZYPM", "B004EXWGJW", "B001O4KBN2", "B00DJYK1XU", "B00GOC74UW", "B000MGTQ6G", "B00A2XQTF0", "B002C8YSBU", "B001HUHBC2", "B004083REE", "B00GLPYVT4", "B003Q7B7HO", "B00FM4S8IU", "B009M4KT3I", "B000KLQUSK", "B00AIA884W", "B0051GOB2G"], "bought_together": ["B00DXLO086", "B00DXLO0D6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00DXLO086", "B00DXLO0D6", "B00AIA89OQ", "B000E3L7FK"]}, "price": 12.47, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 36054}, "asin": "B0009B16TY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51CC44KP9FL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Tabitha - The Entire Series"}

{"description": "Black Oil, the second volume in theX-Files Mythologyseries, covers one ofThe X-Files' weirder concepts: the alien being that travels from host to host, occasionally revealing itself as it travels across a person's eyeballs. But the volume actually begins with a two-parter from season 3, \"Nisei\" and \"731,\" in which FBI agents Mulder (David Duchovny) and Scully (Gillian Anderson) dig deeper into topics of post-World War II Japanese scientists conducting experiments on alien and human subjects, mass executions at a leprosy colony, Scully's own abduction experience and her sister's murder, and a possible alien-human hybrid being hidden aboard a railroad car.That's our way of saying thatBlack Oilwill make little sense to theX-Filesnovice. In fact, because those first two episodes (as well as other, later episodes in the set, \"Memento Mori,\" \"Tempus Fugit\" and \"Max\") deal more with abduction than with the black oil, they would have fit more appropriately in the first volume, titledAbduction. It appears, then, thatThe X-Files Mythologyis not intended as a themed collection of episodes, but rather an inexpensive and smartly packaged attempt to capture the completeX-Filesconspiracy/alien arc while bypassing the stand-alone \"creature feature\" episodes. As that arc makes for riveting watching and did giveThe X-Filesits water-cooler reputation, theMythologyseries is a good buy for new viewers or just for casual fans who want to pick up a bunch of great episodes with some new commentary tracks. The four-discBlack Oilset encompasses 15 episodes (starting late in season 3 and ending early in season 5, the period often considered the peak of the series). Notable episodes such as \"Talitha Cumi,\" \"Herrenvolk,\" \"Tenguska,\" \"Gethsemane,\" and \"Redux\" offered more about the alien bounty hunters, Mulder's family, Scully's affliction, the mysterious informant named X, and turncoat agent Krycek. Still, devoted fans should stick to the complete-season sets for memorable episodes that are excluded from this set, such as \"Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose,\" \"War of the Coprophages,\" \"Hell Money,\" \"Jose Chung'sFrom Outer Space,\" \"Home,\" \"Musings of a Cigarette Smoking Man,\" and \"Paper Hearts,\" to name a few. That's not even mentioning \"Leonard Betts,\" the plot of which was technically outside the normal arc but contained a key dramatic revelation.New features are less generous than on volume 1, restricted to director commentaries on three episodes plus the next installment of creator Chris Carter's new \"Threads of Mythology\" documentary.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0007ZEO7I", "B0009X7646", "B000AQ68X2", "B0007X7044", "B00177YA0G", "B001FACH7S", "B0006UEVUE", "B000BOH986", "B000EXDS3E", "B000CNE0TC", "B000EXDS3Y", "B000CNE0SS", "B000EXDS34", "B000BOH98G", "B001G7PSZI", "B000BOH990", "B000CNE0T2", "B00KUS5YGC", "B00005JM39", "B002VH7P5S", "0061075957", "B001CY5N00", "B003V1IU3O", "B000244E2O", "B0018O4YT0", "B009PNHSYY", "B00DW5IKN4", "B005PYL8VQ"], "bought_together": ["B0007ZEO7I", "B0009X7646"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0009X7646", "B0007X7044", "B0007ZEO7I", "B001FACH7S"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 106863}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 21.94, "brand": "DUCHOVNY,DAVID", "asin": "B0009NZ2RE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510N87CPQZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The X-Files Mythology, Vol. 2 - Black Oil"}

{"description": "Robert Altman, the great ironist of American movies, can't resist beginningVincent & Theowith video of an art auction at Christie's, where Van Gogh'sSunflowersattracts dizzying multi-million-dollar bids. Dissolve to the utterly squalid hovel where Vincent (Tim Roth) lives--reminding us that the artist sold but one painting in his poor, tormented lifetime.Vincent & Theois an unusual and--fittingly enough--impressionistic look at Vincent and his brother Theo (Paul Rhys), the mad genius and the art broker. These parallel lives unfold, with Vincent's celebrated wallow in the fires of art running alongside Theo's neurotic struggle to fit into the real world. Roth is mesmerizing and frightening as Vincent, while Rhys gives a more mannered performance that fits Theo's tortured ambivalence. The eerie buzz of Gabriel Yared's music helps us get inside Vincent's head. If the true-life circumstances are unavoidably grim and Altman's pace is slow, almost druggy, the film nevertheless casts a spell.

{"description": "Creepy, tense, and enigmatic, Renny Harlin'sMindhuntersis a grisly cross between Agatha Christie's whodunit classicAnd Then There Were Noneand Jonathan Demme's horrifyingThe Silence of the Lambs. An interesting ensemble cast, including Christian Slater (Windtalkers), Jonny Lee Miller (Melinda and Melinda), L.L. Cool J (Harlin'sDeep Blue Sea), and Kathryn Morris (television'sCold Case) portray promising FBI profilers-in-training. Val Kilmer plays their ambiguous instructor putting the candidates through their paces and leaving them for a weekend on a spooky island, where those who survive a terrifying exercise--penetrating the mind of a serial killer via elaborate clues--will go to the head of the class. The rules change, however, when the students themselves turn out to be victims, bumped off one after another, the survivors half-mad with suspicion and paranoia that the murderer is one of their own. The film's concept is sound even if the execution (so to speak) gets out of hand with problems of logic. Among other things, none of these characters could possibly find time to pull off some of the psychopath's more complicated killing rituals. Quibbles aside, however,Mindhuntersis particularly watchable if one is in the mood for a movie that plays mind games.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00008EY9G", "B00HLTD3ZW", "B002GHHHL0", "6305047456", "0783240295", "B00AEFYF2K", "B00022XE6S", "B003VA3JUO", "B004BR7XGM", "B00003CXSD", "B000C0Z93G", "B000R4SMCW", "B00IKM5LXG", "B00IKM5OCO", "B0000ALPFL", "B00005JKQS", "B000R348QW", "B00J11U54K", "B00JA3RVG4", "B00H1RMWYW", "6305505802", "B001ASIHZG", "B0007W7I4W", "6305922675", "B00AIBZMD6", "B009AMAJPA", "B00BEIYGT8", "B000056HPB", "6305090564", "B00005JMWP", "B000T28Q00", "B00009RDG9", "B00EZ50SGW", "B00003CXUP", "B0042FDCR2", "B00AEFY6PQ", "B00AEFXEGS", "B009HIKAN8", "B00005UQ9W", "B00JU949TK", "B0058ZPNBI", "B00151QYXU", "B00C7T0EPS", "B0006D3HGA", "B00DZH8H2S", "B00AEFYCW8", "6301971345", "B001CC7PLM", "B00005JD5M", "B00003W8NT", "B00BEIYIF0", "B001QOGYFO", "B002WSYLLM", "6304884400", "B000BUNZY2", "B0084NZEPG", "0790732149", "B00DZP1C2W", "B00003CXND", "B00003CXSP", "B002O3Z4WK", "B002NZK5RI", "B00BEJL6JK", "B00GICP7UW", "B00DWZHTOU", "B00AEFXPSK", "B003Y5H4SO", "B00022R9BE", "B003ASLJJU", "B000055Y0Y", "B00000IQVQ", "B0015OKWL2", "B00CX7EMM0", "B002AK9UPO", "B000MNOX8U", "B00AEBBA2W", "078322799X", "B001BP4K22", "B00HGB9NAY", "B002O3Z4ZW", "B002AT8KA6", "B000NQRR1Q", "B00005JKIP", "0790729334", "B00HOGBXS6", "B0018LX9SU", "B00005O5B5", "B00BLF9FOK", "B00AEBB9AA", "B007549W62", "B000BVM1S2", "B0000541TL", "B00HEPC0TS", "B00BTYOYG2", "B00275EHDM", "B00DMUFXOS", "B00003CXQG", "B000IJ79TS", "B008FCX2D2", "B00JL6L4WC"], "bought_together": ["B00008EY9G"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0671528904", "B00022XE6S", "B00008EY9G"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 47503}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 18.99, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B0009YA3OA", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51YtxsGY2sL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Mindhunters"}

{"description": "A top 10 show in its first season (a top 20 show in its second),Hogan's Heroes, likeGilligan's Island, got little love from critics during its seven-year run, but it would come to be ranked among TV's guiltiest pleasures.Hogan's Heroeshas gotten something of a bad rap. It is not a situation comedy set in a concentration camp. It is, instead, set in a P.O.W. camp, where Col. Hogan (Bob Crane, a former top radio jock, in his star-making role) and his men \"trick the dumb Germans,\" to quote the late Crane's former wife, Sigrid Valdis, in her enlightening commentary on the episode, \"Hogan Gives a Birthday Party.\" While Valdis reveals that the filmVon Ryan's Expresswas a key inspiration for the series, the show seems to takes its cue from Billy Wilder'sStalag 17, with its blend of comedy (albeit more broad than darkly cynical) and espionage action. Though camp commandant Col. Klink (Werner Klemperer, who would win an Emmy for his career-defining role) was, in the words of one character, \"a bubble-headed fool,\"Hogan's Heroeswas not quite a burlesque of bad taste.Seemingly in response to wide-ranging outrage over the show's misunderstood premise (aMadmagazine parody at the time was brutal), there are some bracing dramatic moments that cut through the comedy. In \"Operation Briefcase,\" Hogan is recruited to assist an attempt to assassinate Hitler. Hogan disdainfully tells the German plotter, \"It's the least you can do, considering you're the same bunch of guys who put him in business.\" In the episode \"Will the Real Adolf Hitler Please Stand Up?\" Hogan explodes at one of his men when he imitates Hitler. \"Imitating that nut in Berlin,\" he fumes. \"It's not all that funny.\" But somehow,Hogan's Heroesis, thanks to Crane and Klemperer (\"You talk about two people born to play a part,\" remarks Valdis), not to mention John Banner as the jowl-cheeked buffoon, Sgt. Schultz, and the rest of the crack ensemble, including real-life concentration camp survivor Robert Clary as LeBeau, Richard Dawson as Newkirk, Ivan Dixon as \"Kinch,\" and Valdis herself, who debuted this season as Klink's secretary, Hilda, she of the scene-stealing tight sweaters and low-cut peasant blouses, and whose chief dialogue consisted of \"Col. Hogan to see the commandant.\" The extras are a retro blast. The most bizarre is a commercial in which Carol Channing is smuggled into the barracks to enjoy a Jello dessert with Hogan and company.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000CCBCK8", "B0007KIFK0", "B000FSME1K", "B000IHYXIK", "B000NOIX7K", "B000N6UF10", "B000EQ46HI", "B006OKOUX8", "B0012680AS", "B000UX6TKC", "B002LCOHPE", "B000M8N412", "B000S6LTH4", "B001LM64VK", "B0006BAWSI", "B000LE16Y4", "B00005JNS8", "B0072BNJ0I", "B0000V4906", "B001N26GSE", "B003PK28FM", "B0009OUBPQ", "B001DMVZJ4", "B000BYRCF6", "B001D68NFO", "B000BT96OG", "B008LC8RQ8", "B000N4RAQA", "B001BN4WHW", "B00FFARI7I", "B000IONJI8", "B0007LXP7W", "B0006TPE1U", "B001SLNPSO", "B00009VRF0", "B000ERVJKO", "B000MGBSH6", "B0013LRKV2", "B000CCBCCG", "B0029F2M2S", "B0007Y08SS", "B0007YMWFK", "B005F7BS2C", "B004MLEYV4", "B000GW8U9U", "B001JAHQGG", "B000E5KQLY", "B0002IQKAY", "B000LE16VC", "B001E0O8DA", "B0028S110A", "B000BITV1A", "B0050MB5AC", "B0009UC80G", "B003W5C0TY", "B001J0FVYK", "B0002XVQNK", "B000ASDFIQ", "B001E6JC30", "B001CQONOA", "B001UXJGII", "B000LXGXY8", "B000NOIX66", "B00IF0KAYS", "B000UAE7VS", "B001DMVZJO", "B00GC2KI2U", "B001DZOCZU", "B005MXQD4W", "B000YKYT1M", "B00GM1X2JM", "B000VDDE1I", "B001666484", "B0014BQR3I", "B001992NXI", "B0009W5J3M", "B002OOWKYE", "B00GM1X2RO", "B0007Y08P6", "B001992NZG", "B00IFK7OFG", "B000F48D0U", "B00IFK7ONI", "B008K1PX7Q", "B000BF0C8E", "B000LC4C60", "B0006UEVTA", "B00096S47G", "B0025KVTLW", "B000BGR1B4", "B005R2SHX8", "B0009B16TO", "B0002I837M", "B00105307O", "B000V3JGIS", "B000GIXIN2", "B0006IUDXA", "B000HWZ4HU", "B0030ATZH6", "B0001CNQVM"], "bought_together": ["B000CCBCK8", "B000FSME1K"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000CCBCK8", "B0007KIFK0", "B000IHYXIK", "B000FSME1K"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 27486}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 12.99, "brand": "Paramount", "asin": "B000A6T1J0", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61506HX51BL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Hogan's Heroes - The Complete 2nd Season"}

{"description": "How is it possible that11:14went virtually unreleased in theaters? After modest film-festival exposure, it played briefly in San Francisco in August 2005 (over two years after it was completed), but that's a cruel twist of fate for such a cleverly twisted movie about cruel twists of fate. Destined for sleeper status on DVD (and given a slightly higher profile by Hilary Swank's subsequent Oscar-winning performance inMillion Dollar Baby), the audacious debut of writer-director Greg Marcks boasts a fantastic cast in a smartly constructed comedy/thriller, partly inspired byBlood Simple, in which a fatal traffic accident is examined and re-examined from multiple perspectives. The flashback structure involves all of the characters and events that lead up to the accident's deadly occurrence at 11:14 on an otherwise pleasant evening in Middleton, a typical suburb of Anytown, USA (filmed in the vicinity of Los Angeles). Marcks's screenplay attracted an impressive ensemble cast (costar Swank also signed on as an executive producer), and they're all given equal time as the intertwined plots are revealed. They include Rachael Leigh Cook (whose bad-girl behavior sets the chain of events in motion); Patrick Swayze and Barbara Hershey as her worried parents; Swank and Shawn Hatosy as would-be criminals with a dimwit plan; Henry Thomas as a drunk driver whose involvement is deeper than we realize; and Colin Hanks as one of three teenage vandals on a fast track to trouble. With falling corpses, graveyard sex, reckless gunplay, and a severed penis, it's all in good, grisly fun (apart from intricate plotting, Marcks has no lofty agenda up his sleeve), and there's ultimately not much point to its random misfortune, but11:14is clearly the work of a promising filmmaker, worthy of rediscovery on DVD. Bonus features include Marcks's intelligent commentary, a standard behind-the-scenes featurette, and a useful \"character jump\" feature allowing viewers to choose a plot trajectory whenever one character encounters another.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0040J1RX6", "B0014Z4OKW", "6305720134", "B001URA5Y8", "B000BBOUUE", "B00008L3TK", "B003U6SJY0", "B004SUDQAE", "B0034JKYSC", "B0002J58GU", "B002NALPFO", "B0009ML2UG", "B0016MJ6WE", "B0000996F3", "B004QXJZY4", "B001AIQ14A", "B00000F8KW", "6305133409", "B001C5LLVE", "B002PQ1PBA", "B004RE29WM", "B000CQQIDU", "B0001BRSRG", "B000MTFFO0", "B0000639HN", "B000CQLZ0Q", "B000GI3KGM", "B00AEBB86U", "0783228686", "B001CRC4DG", "B00HOGBXS6", "B001U0HB5Q", "B006GVN05O", "B00112S8RS", "B0009S4IG0", "B00BNH9NCU", "B000PISZ7W", "B001B73Q20", "B007UW9WMS", "B000GDH9NM", "B003EYVXTG", "B00004WI53", "B0000AC8LR", "B0082CWTSY", "B008PUI1GM", "B000FFJ826", "0767835093", "B000MGUZCU", "B000FUTVLY", "B0002KQNMC", "B000E6ESL2", "B00DPUB56U", "B0034G4P30", "B009AMAJPA", "B00JPQ1I7O", "B005Z9MFCM", "B00005YUPD", "B004EC5ITI", "B0031U8OEK", "B003AWRM9M", "B001AK3S4O", "B002S5N052", "B00003CWN3", "B004O8OLO0", "B00I45844W", "B00IKM5MIA", "B001K98MG4", "B000MMMTBY", "B003IIST9U", "B001UDS4BS", "B00007AJE1", "B0083QN87K", "B00000IBL1", "B004EQAVA0", "B000KX0IOK", "B00275EGNS", "B00HF98SHG", "B0097C046W", "B000GB5M3S", "B00J5G1P2W", "B00005A3KS", "B00AEFXGIY", "B002UOMGYW", "B0011VIO3W", "B000PKG8TM", "B00A47BT7C", "0792838041", "B004SIP7VM", "B000A3XY5A", "B00008EY9G", "B0001FGBSE", "B001MVYUR0", "B0030E5NJ6", "B007549W62", "B00000F35Z", "B005Z9MGRG", "B000HC2M0C", "B00005JH9M", "B003498SCQ", "B000GI3KGC"], "bought_together": ["B0040J1RX6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["6305133409", "B0034JKYSC", "B0040J1RX6", "B000FI8MPW"]}, "price": 5.0, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 75977}, "asin": "B000ALM40I", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516T38H2WQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "11:14"}
{"description": "Home to some of the world's best food and fashion, the French also have the wonderful habit of producing some of the world's best movies. WithHigh Tension, French director Alexandre Aja offers up a bloody buffet of terror; a violent concoction of style over substance, with a bloody French twist.       Two college girlfriends, Maria and Alex, take a weekend to study at the secluded country home of Alex's parents.   Shortly after their arrival, a mysterious killer appears, and things take a shockingly terrible turn for the worse. As the horror and body count rises, Maria and Alex find themselves fighting for their lives, and it's revealed that things are not exactly as they seem.     Essentially a one-act cat-and-mouse affair,High Tensionis an explosive bloody thrill ride that rarely lets up.   Oozing style in every color-saturated frame and boasting some intense performances, Aja mainly succeeds in sustaining an intense momentum throughout the film.  The plot occasionally suffers from a thin, flimsy storyline, and the abundant graphic scenes of violence will either thrill and delight, or simply disgust.   Nonetheless, this adrenalin-fueled addition to the genre gives the American slasher flick a real run for its money.High Tensionis high-art horror, and comes highly recommended.--Matt Wold", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001MEJY8W", "B0014VPFVS", "B00125WATQ", "B000EOTVU2", "B000GI3KGC", "B0009WFEDC", "B002EOVXBK", "B00GGY4R3K", "B001G9CNI6", "B00005K9O8", "B000WC38EQ", "B00009W0U4", "B000X1RYEQ", "B0041KKYCY", "B004AC6PV2", "B000EHRVP6", "B0028DRGDQ", "B000N3AW6G", "B005SQRYB4", "B001MFNB4O", "B000GSYRY6", "B000IHY9TS", "B000S0GYRU", "B00009MEC4", "B00187FPC2", "B001D2WU9I", "B0000CABGW", "B001B187L6", "B00G5GNYY2", "B008G1JIQC", "B001JV5BIA", "B002LMSWN2", "B000WC389G", "B0082A3HFK", "B002OVO18A", "B004P2VQZ2", "B00699G622", "B0009OUBC4", "B008JFUNYG", "B000FS9FE4", "B004EI2NP4", "B0013D8L7M", "B008NNY8XQ", "B000GI3RHY", "B00J81S92S", "B001D5C1OO", "B0031U8OEK", "B00196UTEG", "B006QWC2ZC", "B008WAM2E2", "B0015ET3YO", "B005J9ZFQG", "B000MM0LIM", "B00BSU0FQA", "B008BM5WQG", "B00AJLHUA8", "B000GLL1U6", "B003Q6D246", "B0083H6B0U", "B00006FDBW", "B001MVYUR0", "B000IMUYJM", "B00DMUFXOS", "B0021L8UPS", "B000099T3M", "B00CU00JTU", "B003L20IEC", "B0051CSIKQ", "B000NVT0TI", "B00DPUB5EW", "B001D5C1R6", "B00C7C00JU", "B000VKL6Z2", "B006U49SC6", "B0052DP1RC", "B00AZTUUQK", "B002DKGWSE", "B000FZEQWI", "B000RW5BZ0", "B0001611DI", "B0057O6IMS", "B00111YM5Q", "B00177YA6U", "B000UW8596", "B005ER6STG", "B0007WQHI0", "B00079HZY8", "B0009S2T0M", "B00005Q4CS", "B000PKG8TW", "B00006AUIG", "B000AXWHSA", "B001RTKKQW", "B003KGBISE", "B008G33PIM", "B004KDYR20", "6305228876", "B000PMLJMQ", "B002YICNE2", "B0060AAMEI"], "bought_together": ["B001MEJY8W", "B0014VPFVS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001MEJY8W", "B0014VPFVS", "B00GGY4R3K", "B000GI3KGC"]}, "price": 8.37, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 23934}, "asin": "B000ARFPMQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51K3uQHsEXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "High Tension (Unrated Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "The first half ofBattlestar Galactica's second season left no doubts about the continuing excellence of the best science fiction TV series of 2005. Beginning with the Colonial Fleet separated, Col. Tigh (Michael Hogan) botching his temporary command, and Capt. Adama (Edward James Olmos) near death after a Cylon assassination attempt, series producer/developer Ronald D. Moore and his gifted writing staff packed more into these 10 episodes than most series manage in a full season. Maintaining its reputation as an adult drama, the series is compellingly anchored by the gravitas of Olmos and Mary McDonnell, whose role as Fleet President Laura Roslin grows more complex as she reveals her diagnosis of breast cancer and defies Adama, playing the \"religious card\" with her conviction that prophetic visions will lead the embattled fleet toward its legendary home planet Earth. As Adama's son Apollo (Jamie Bamber) wrestles with his role in Roslin's mutinous agenda, paranoia runs high as Cylon copies (or \"avatars\") of Boomer (Grace Park) complicate matters aboard Galactica and on Kobol, where a lost Raptor crew struggles to survive and Dr. Baltar (James Callis) endures the increasingly haunting and manipulative intrusions into his tormented psyche by Number Six (Tricia Helfer), the seductive Cylon who holds the secret to the Cylon master plan to destroy humankind.Further action takes place on Cylon-occupied Caprica, where Starbuck (Katee Sackhoff) and Helo (Tamoh Penikett) discover a group of human resistance fighters who survived the Cylons' nuclear attack in season 1. As all of these plot threads are expertly interwoven, the high-stakes conflict ofBG 2.0culminates in a suspenseful mid-season cliffhanger. Through all of this,Battlestar Galacticamaintains consistently high standards of intelligent drama and well-justified, story-based use of spectacular special effects, while developing rich relationships across a broad spectrum of interesting supporting characters. The series' large and likable cast is well-used throughout (even smaller roles are given adequate dimension), and Moore's \"podcast\" commentaries provide a smart, thorough analysis of the show's writing process and conceptual evolution. Yes, it's undeniably true that this half-season DVD set is a blatantly commercial ploy to lure more and more viewers into the ongoing season (which resumed in January 2006), but you can hardly blame Universal for capitalizing on a high-quality series.

{"description": "A hilarious comedy about frustrated waiters, stingy tippers and dicey food, Lions Gate Films' WAITING... stars Ryan Reynolds, Anna Faris and Justin Long as young employees battling boredom at Shenanigan's, a generic chain restaurant. A waiter for four years since high school, Dean (Justin Long) has never questioned his job at Shenanigan's. But when he learns that Chett, a high school classmate, now has a lucrative career in electrical engineering, he's thrown into turmoil about his dead-end life. Dean's friend Monty (Ryan Reynolds) is in exactly the same boat, but he couldn't care less. More concerned with partying and getting laid, Monty is put in charge of training Mitch (John Francis Daley), a shy new employee.  Over the course of one chaotic shift, Mitch gets to know the rest of Shenanigan's quirky staff: Monty's tough-talking ex-girlfriend, Serena (Anna Faris), Shenanigan's over-zealous manager, Dan (David Koechner), and head cook Raddimus (Luis Guzman), who's obsessed with a senseless staff-wide competition known only as \"The Game\"...  Featuring crazy busboys, unsanitary kitchen antics, and lots of talk about sex, WAITING... is a hysterical, behind-the-scenes look at the restaurant industry, and an affectionate ode to those lost, and thoroughly unproductive, days of youth.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001MFNB58", "B000EMGJAO", "B000069CF0", "B000LC3ICE", "B000E6EHE0", "B00363WGBO", "B000JJ4DNW", "B000IZJZIU", "B000WZEZGI", "B0023TCWE8", "B000I0RNVQ", "B00AEFYS2M", "B001J9KJ4I", "B000AP04L0", "B001L9EXTS", "B000Y7U93C", "B00AEFZ3XU", "B001OD4S50", "B00AEFXVW0", "B00007AJGM", "B00005JNZU", "B0002V7TMY", "B000031WD9", "B000YW8RN6", "B00260HH1W", "B0016MJ6GA", "B0009P42WI", "B000063RQO", "B00005JKMN", "B002ZG97XI", "B0017JHQPK", "B000BKVQS4", "B004HO6I2E", "B0007DFJ0G", "B004SIP6LS", "B001G5T6GW", "B000M9CB4W", "B00000FA91", "B00005JMX6", "B00005V9HR", "0783230338", "B004SIP8ES", "B00AEFXIUK", "B00029RTAI", "B0009HBPN0", "B001O0TWYK", "B000K7VHOG", "B001KKU9DW", "6301964160", "B00860YIJU", "B000EGDBZ6", "630529142X", "B000J4P9P8", "B000WCN8QE", "B004I9SJH0", "B00005JMYI", "B00AEFY854", "B00003CXPS", "B00AEFYZCU", "B002Q4VBPQ", "B007D0FUTG", "B003Y5H5B0", "B000O77SF4", "B002FU8IWU", "B003PIUINS", "B00003CXWV", "B002IKIHEG", "B004SIP95G", "B008R65XNS", "B002T4GWWA", "B00AEFYAMA", "B0068MNO2U", "B000MCH5RM", "B000BO0L90", "B002ZGW92E", "B005LAIH9A", "B000G0O5I2", "0790729997", "B004EPZ084", "B00009W5F2", "B000N3SU92", "B00AEFY0XE", "B00008WJD6", "B004SEUJO6", "6305222908", "B00DW5IKYS", "B00AEBB8FQ", "B0026BXHQ0", "B00AEBBA2C", "B000OYC7BW", "B002ZG98B4", "B000FKO5QK", "B00029RTCG", "B000TZJBPQ", "B000031EFY", "B0016Q2D66", "B00AG4714S", "B0006HBZEW", "0800141687", "B00441GYVK"], "bought_together": ["B001MFNB58", "B000EMGJAO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00E8RKHWW", "B000AP04L0", "B004SEUIW4", "B000EMGJAO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 11312}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.21, "brand": "Vidmark/Trimark", "asin": "B000CPH9PM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51TJVHXCPGL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Waiting...

Stellar performances from Hoffman and Keener, as well as Academy Award(r) winner Chris Cooper (Adaptation) are why critics are calling CAPOTE a \"must-see movie.\"", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004SIP71M", "B0014GI6I2", "B008220DGE", "B000M341SC", "B0013XZ2QK", "B00112S8RS", "B002LVVCJY", "B0000AN4JE", "B00008WI9N", "B00AEBB8SS", "B001P3SA8K", "B00003CWTI", "B00005BCK9", "B0006GW2JU", "B00008K7AO", "B00320J6WS", "B000PAAJZ6", "B00AQBDU4Q", "B00000IC7G", "6305803765", "B0060ZJ7DA", "B00AEFXE9U", "B00GUO2SKA", "B0000BXMZ8", "B00F3L8P4E", "6305781095", "B00005JMW7", "B00000G02H", "B00G7QPXUI", "B00H9L26AA", "0783226845", "B00G4Q3KOC", "0679745580", "B0009W5IMO", "B00H9KKGTO", "B00GMV8M2Y", "1439187509", "B000ERVJQ8", "B00H7LJ2UO", "B000HRMAPE", "B00AQTY3JO", "B001QUF3SW", "B0060ZJ7BC", "140009691X", "B00H83EUQW", "B00FZ4KR4U", "B000A7DVR2", "B00GSBMNOQ", "B000E1NXJ0", "0671228110", "B00007AJF8", "B00005JLRE", "B008220DIC", "B00GPWEPZ8", "B00067AVKQ", "B00D2CYU2W", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B00G15MDI0", "6305781052", "B008JFUNKU", "B00EV4EUT8", "B00AEBB9CS", "B00BEIYKM6", "B00AEFY8MM", "B00GST8U4U", "B003UESJH4", "B00009W5CA", "B004SIP8ZM", "B006OFN0SE", "B00BTYRB58", "B00080ZG10", "0812978919", "0679745645", "B00005JLKN", "B004UXUX4Q", "B00GMV8L1Q", "B00AZNEW5G", "B00121QGPY", "B000087F7Q", "B0047T74CM", "B0034G4P30", "B004SIP6VI", "0800141806", "B004U7MR1Y", "B00HOGBXS6", "B004SIP6QI", "B004FQX59I", "B006FE83UE", "B00HF98SPS", "B00D3LA5WG", "B004SIP98S", "B0062CU564", "B00005JMJG", "6304712936", "B00H9HZITU", "B0073U2EWM", "B004FQX5B6", "B00AHTYI5M", "B00DL48BM6", "B00G7QPUII"], "bought_together": ["B004SIP71M", "B0014GI6I2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B008220DGE", "B004SIP71M", "B000M341SC", "B0013XZ2QK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 15437}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 10.95, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B000E33VWW", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/418QYZP0NTL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Capote"}
{"description": "Gidgetlaunched the career of the ever-perky Sally Field (who decades later still looks like the sweetie-pie beach bunny she played in the mid-'60s series). The show is a valentine to Southern California, surfing, and plucky girl power--in fact, Gidget's self-aware musings and intrepid ways of getting out of trouble lay the groundwork for later TV heroines like Buffy and Veronica Mars. The show's aged surprisingly well, mostly because of the undeniable charms of Field, who seems to take her teenage \"horror stories\"--as when squeeze Jeff (a.k.a. Moon Doggie) is poised to return to Princeton and suggests they date other people--with a knowing grain of salt. The teen drama is all a bit tongue in cheek, since it's clear nothing will get our Gidget down for long. The dialogue is a real treat, a crazy mix of late film noir (\"How old's the underripe tomato?\") and pre-Summer of Love hipster California-speak (\"Well, look at all the wiggy birds around here!\"). The set includes all 32 episodes, with a short interview with Field, who has a lot of affection for her young persona--as do we all, Daddy-o.--A.T.

{"description": "No collection of classic TV Westerns is complete withoutCheyenne, the trailblazing 1955 series that premiered within weeks ofGunsmoke. The strapping Clint Walker stars as Cheyenne Bodie, the iconic role that earned him his place in the Hall of Great Western Performers at the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum in Oklahoma City. Cheyenne is a classic Western hero in the drifter tradition, accepting jobs ranging from frontier scout to trail boss. In this first season, he is accompanied at times by sidekick Smitty (L.Q. Jones). \"It takes about a minute to know a man,\" one character remarks during the course ofCheyenne's first season. But we size up Cheyenne in an instant. He is a man of honor, straight shooting and plainspoken. In one episode, he declines an offered position of ranch foreman. \"I don't like the job,\" he states, \"and when I don't like a job, I turn it down.\" When a woman refers to Indians as \"savages\" in the first episode, Cheyenne enlightens her, \"The Indians think we're the savages.\" Several episodes, including \"Quicksand\" and \"The Last Train West,\" echo the John Ford masterpiece,Stagecoach, as Cheyenne finds himself amongst a diverse and disparate group of people who are thrown together by circumstance.Cheyennewas part of a new breed of \"adult Western.\" The episode \"Johnny Bravo\" (was this the inspiration for Greg's rock star nom de plume onThe Brady Bunch?) deals with a rancher who disapproves of his daughter's affair with a Mexican. Keep a sharp lookout for actors who would later become Hollywood's most wanted. A pre-MaverickJames Garner appears as different characters in three episodes. Dennis Hopper is hot-triggered gunfighter the Utah Kid, in \"Quicksand.\" And that's the future Miss Hathaway, Nancy Kulp, as a sassy waitress in \"Johnny Bravo.\"Cheyennewas originally broadcast as one of three rotating series under the banner,Warner Brothers Presents, but it quickly established itself as the runaway hit. Like the best Westerns, it is anything but quaint nostalgia. With its timeless setting, compelling stories, charismatic hero, and positive values, the sun will never set onCheyenne.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000TQZBNQ", "B006W95BWA", "B009RNK0YC", "B00BR0SECI", "B00E8RVSZC", "B007AAF3FK", "B00GJT22VQ", "B005TZFYWA", "B000F9T70K", "B00668IFWA", "B00B00HUC0", "B000A0GXH4", "B005LVIP1E", "B003ZFXE82", "B00E96AY20", "B000EHSVB4", "B00AWWX7X8", "B000PHX5KU", "B00192BNJU", "B00KTZALDC", "B002DH20PQ", "B000VS6R3A", "B007RUZ29A", "B005UFUU6E", "B009RNK13M", "B004H0M34K", "B009V2KO9K", "B003VKVTL0", "B000NOIX7U", "B009OE2NS0", "B003BTO4HM", "B004L5GY82", "B00IU6HPIQ", "B000EOR0BY", "B0001JXQ2Y", "B006ZL1P84", "B00IS6WQ2S", "B004HHX9T6", "B00HQLZCIQ", "B00DOZNIVG", "B009OE2NZI", "B00G3BRCBU", "B004PQM81E", "B003552QUO", "B0002W4TVM", "B004IY1AVM", "B002XY5EAC", "B005D7E7Y0", "B00I1GUS0C", "B0064CT90U", "B00F6D62O4", "B00CL151ZU", "B00IP965IO", "B0025Y3SZS", "B007V4ETS2", "B00A6SZRT0", "B001JAHPMG", "B009DA74DY", "B000W8OM68", "B001E6JC1W", "B005PTYPK2", "B00CL151P0", "B007V973KI", "B00A2XQTFK", "B001MZVZGA", "B001072DFM", "B0013LRKVM", "B00BAXTY9O", "B005D7E7PY", "B001TWT0CW", "B00082ZROO", "B00A92MBIS", "B00BXTDVEO", "B009INAHZS", "B008OIQZ36", "B0013LRKY4", "B00BAXTYGW", "B00J9BZ4KC", "B00769U98Q", "B0055SJY86", "B00JEZWRE4", "B009ERK2UI", "B0083TUEDS", "B001E6HUXO", "B0006Z2L1A", "B004Q0VR5C", "B00AMDA2OY", "B0046S8MRU", "B00AX5B0RY", "B004T0XYLE", "B003XEKXYI", "B00A4Y614G", "B0008FXSSI", "B00H7BJ0WO", "B00H7BJ1I2", "B004GSVX8A", "B00CCYNYBO", "B0030Y12BE", "B0013D8M4E"], "bought_together": ["B000TQZBNQ", "B006W95BWA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000TQZBNQ", "B00E96AY20", "B00E8RVSZC", "B006W95BWA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 9392}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 11.49, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B000EQ46H8", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61u4edac2gL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Cheyenne - The Complete First Season"}

{"description": "The best thing about this take on the celebrated Missouri outlaw is Nicholas Ray's dynamic use of CinemaScope, a format that left most mid-'50s directors flatfooted.  Ray composes his action in slashing diagonals, over multi-leveled ground, with sectors of the wide screen defined by frames-within-the-frame and different qualities of light and color.  Which is to say, he continues the radical experimentation of his 1955 James Dean classicRebel Without a Causewhile attempting to develop a fresh, contemporary perspective on another violent young protagonist who's an outsider in his own society.Nunnally Johnson's script for 20th Century-Fox's 1939Jesse Jamesis credited as source material, but Ray opted for a tortuous, balladlike flashback structure--beginning with the James-Younger gang's ruinous raid on Northfield, Minnesota, 400 miles from their Missouri stomping ground--that aims to deconstruct the outlaw's populist legend.  \"Jesse James\" is an elusive subject; the Minnesota posse never sets eyes on him in the jagged first reel of the movie.  How much of an Old West \"Robin Hood\" was he?  And how murderously vengeful was his criminal career as he struck back against the railroads and their cold-blooded police force, the Pinkerton (here, \"Remington\") agency, and Union-sympathizer neighbors who hated this former member of the wartime guerrilla band, Quantrill's Raiders?However radical the director's intentions, his movie runs afoul of studio recutting and an underwhelming cast of Fox contract players.  Jeffrey Hunter (recently loaned out to play Ethan Edwards' companion inThe Searchers) comes off best as Jesse's thoughtful brother Frank (a pattern that holds true for Henry Fonda inJesse Jamesand Stacy Keach inThe Long Riders).  But Ray was stymied by Robert Wagner as Jesse--in the phrase of Ray biographer Bernard Eisenschitz, a player \"expressive of nothing but Californian physical culture.\"  (James Dean being dead, Ray's first choice for Jesse was ... Elvis Presley!)--Richard T.

{"description": "The seventh season ofEverybody Loves Raymondserves up a delightful mix of comedy and pathos as the Barones deal with cults, theft, marriage, and death. The season opener (which aired on CBS in 2002) starts where season 6 ended: with Debra (Patricia Heaton) and Marie (Doris Roberts) feuding, and Ray (Ray Romano) and Robert (Brad Garrett) conjuring up a plan to get them to make up. This 5-disc set includes all 25 episodes, including the two-part wedding finale between Robert and Amy (Monica Horan). In typical Marie fashion, she has a shocking and inappropriate comment to make when the priest makes the rhetorical statement, \"If anyone can think of any reason why these two should not be joined, speak now or forever hold your peace.\" There is very little peace when Marie is around. A fantastic cook and a loving mother, Marie is the reason why women worldwide dislike mama's boys. When things go wrong on the home front, Ray isn't above comparing Debra to his mother. Sometimes it's unintentional. But at other times, it's calculated as a means of getting his way. The show's saving grace is the likeability of the characters and the strong writing, which makes up in humor what it lacks in subtlety.The relationship between woebegone Robert and Amy is a delight, especially because viewers get to meet her parents this season. Fred Willard (Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy) and Georgia Engel (The Mary Tyler Moore Show) play Amy's conservative parents who'd rather see their daughter remain single than marry into the Barone family. Chris Elliott also guest stars as Amy's spoiled, unemployed brother who likes to stir things up between the two clans. The show's success always has been less about completely out-there premises than taking a slice of everyday life--helping the kids with their homework, sharing chores, dealing with in laws--and presenting them in a comical manner. In the real world, a lazy husband like Ray wouldn't be nearly as cuddly. And an interfering mother-in-law like Marie would not be tolerated by most wives. But onEverybody Loves Raymond, they're two of the main reasons why viewers consistently tuned in to this hit sitcom.--Jae-Ha Kim", "related": {"also_bought": ["B006MFQ4DE", "B000N8UXTW", "B000T22PVG", "B000BNTM46", "B000A7PKGW", "B004D2GMVM", "B0007R4SWC", "B00CJ7Y1CK", "B0001ZMWXW", "B0009E27DA", "B001DZOCVO", "B00G4SF9NA", "B000K4X5QM", "B000NA1W3Q", "B000TGJ82G", "B000GRU09S", "B004MWLXTY", "B002N5N4PS", "B001JAHSKU", "B005D0OHA6", "B001L1S1WQ", "B00ESK1PES", "B000ND91OA", "B004WO9OMA", "B000I2J6W8", "B000957O8C", "B000FBH3WC", "B000M343AI", "B000E6ESBW", "B000MX7V5W", "B0000CGNEC", "B002AMVEEM", "B00GOC74Z2", "B008LCRABQ", "B000QFCDAY", "B002E58FU6", "B0001NBNJ8", "B008LCRAC0", "B00070HK4C", "B005DCJ0Q0", "B000EYK4H6", "B000HT3PEM", "B000VDDE0Y", "B0009YCLBS", "B00062IDLA", "B0001BS3IE", "B0013D8M3U", "B000AJJNIQ", "B0015XWU9A", "B000UX6TKM", "B000RGULLA", "B000B8I9ZY", "B000BYRCF6", "B008LCRAFC", "B000B8384G", "B008LCRA98", "B001FB4VXU", "B002JVWQUU", "B0006ZM8M2", "B000B5XOUC", "B000C1VBAA", "B002N5N4M6", "B00BUWD7SO", "B0002DRE72", "B000W91RUG", "B0001BS3IY", "B000ERVJMW", "B002C3GTLC", "B003L77G7E", "B00020HAWY", "B0019D151K", "B001P9N9B2", "B0002WZTLQ", "B000GB5M4M", "B0014FAIXO", "B000B5XOUM", "B000Y7U9AK", "B004GJYR82", "B002E58FTW", "B002WIDRLC", "B009LDD1X0", "B00B04NIOU", "B0053O89QU", "B001JAHSAA", "B003L77FZM", "B004ES6TBS", "B00B04NII6", "B00IF0KAYS", "B002E58FUG", "B009LDD3I8", "B000A0GOQY", "B00I099K4U", "B007C8RZJW", "B000CCBCHQ"], "bought_together": ["B000T22PVG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000BNTM46", "B0007R4SWC", "B000T22PVG", "B000A7PKGW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 110164}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 21.52, "brand": "HBO HOME VIDEO", "asin": "B000GRUMQY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51T4EE1YA8L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Everybody Loves Raymond: Season 7"}
{"description": "Universal ruled the monster movie in the 1930s, but this hugely enjoyable DVD set offers a counter-argument from MGM and Warners. Its half-dozen horror titles run the gamut from classic vampirism to baroque romanticism, and gather horror luminaries such as Boris Karloff, Bela Lugosi, and Peter Lorre.The greatest film of the bunch isMad Love(1935), a rich and oft-imitated bit of perversity with a deeply romantic streak. Concert pianist Colin Clive (fromFrankenstein) has his hands wrecked, and his actress wife (Frances Drake) turns to the obsessive Dr. Gogol (Lorre), who has long worshipped her. But the doctor replaces the pianist's hands with those of a murderous circus knife-thrower! Superbly directed by Karl Freund (The Mummy), this eerie film is shaped by Lorre's subtle, uncannily sympathetic performance.Karloff reigns inThe Mask of Fu Manchu(1932), which offers more minute-for-minute lurid action than any other movie in this set. Connoisseurs of horror will be well pleased by the roster:  a crocodile pit, deadly snakes and spiders, poisons, various forms of torture including a man strapped beneath a giant reverberating bell, and Fu Manchu's sexy daughter (Myrna Loy). MGM designer Cedric Gibbons runs wild with a wonderfully daffy Deco-meets-Orientalism scheme. There are some undeniably racist epithets thrown in the direction of the evil Dr. Fu Manchu, but he gives as good as he gets, and the character is ultimately as irresistible as any evil mastermind. Karloff gives one of his juiciest performances ever.Doctor X(1932) is presented in a recently-restored 2-strip Technicolor process (a lot of throbbing greens and oranges), which gives the movie an antique appeal. Doctor Xavier (Lionel Atwill) brings his colleagues together to figure out which of them might be the Full Moon Killer; daughter Fay Wray and reporter Lee Tracy (a typical fast-talking role for this fun actor) tag along. Michael Curtiz directed; he also did the similarMystery of the Wax Museum, again with Atwill (available on theHouse of Waxdisc).The Return of Doctor X(1939) is more of a curio than a full-fledged horror movie, as it has Humphrey Bogart, resplendent in a Bride of Frankenstein hair streak, in a rare supernatural outing.The other two films are directed by Tod Browning.Mark of the Vampire(1935) is a clear example of MGM trying to ride theDraculagravy train, with plenty of smoky graveyards, scuttling possums, and Lugosi in a tuxedo striding through giant spider webs. Lugosi is peripheral here, as Lionel Barrymore hunts down the blood-suckers. It's slow going, but the touches are wonderful and there's a spooky vampiress. Browning makesThe Devil-Doll(1936) a memorably oddball thriller, with Barrymore a wronged man seeking revenge--and exploiting a device that allows people to be miniaturized. All the films have lively commentary tracks, exceptDevil-Doll. Overall this is a very neat package; even the inclusion ofReturn of Doctor Xmakes sense as a pairing with its original. MGM and Warners seemed embarrassed by the horror genre in the thirties, but these examples prove they could rise to Universal's game.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000WNHTCC", "B0009X770E", "B000A0GOEQ", "B000FWHW8Q", "B000TLTCT0", "B002DY9KQG", "B0000694WM", "B001ARDBXU", "B00LT1JHLW", "B000FWHW90", "B000HEVZ7G", "B00009PY38", "B00000ILEU", "B0000B1O9L", "B00005LC4J", "B0000694WH", "B000FI9OCW", "B001B9ZVVC", "B0009X770O", "B0034PWPHY", "B003G9IT3C", "B00LMBURV8", "B000I2JDF8", "B001OSC4G0", "B0007TKNKQ", "B005D0RDKM", "B00DOZNGC2", "B001QFFBAM", "B000UDGOBG", "B00DOZNI8Y", "B00B94VJYW", "B00D9EJFZA", "B00114XLUU", "B000UAFDR0", "B000FS4X64", "B000E8JO32", "B000244F2S", "B00D9EJFV4", "B000PKG7DE", "B00009PY4D", "B00005NSXY", "B00000F62P", "B002945DUW", "B000YRY7VC", "B00CVB6XF2", "B005OT82ZC", "B000A0GOFA", "B00ITZXDDY", "B00FJYXP36", "B0024FAG8A", "B00ICWO1LC", "B00114XLUA", "B0000A2ZU4", "B0013K1AK0", "B009AGEY98", "B0016KCCCC", "B00005LC4L", "B009KG7F30", "B00DZP1C8Q", "B000RXVND8", "B000087F3F", "B000RXVNDI", "B00DTECHWS", "B00DZP1C9K", "B00H4KQN82", "B00457ZNS8", "B00005LC4O", "B00DE1LD6W", "B0024FAG6W", "B0007ZEO8C", "B005D0RDNY", "B00005LC4K", "B0013XZ6SY", "B000K0YM18", "B000N3T0H8", "B000UJCAK4", "B00065GX64", "B00FM4S68W", "B0009X75EC", "B0007R4T26", "B000V3IXAA", "B00HT2RTU6", "B000TGJ89E", "B00009NHBC", "B00009PY45", "B000EHSVJG", "B000068TPF", "B004W6JJXC", "B000A0GOFK", "B009RNK10K", "B00023P4G0", "B0024FAG80", "B0007R4SZY", "B001ASQ9OC", "B000OHZJGO", "B00FERT0PK", "B002YNQEFG", "B00K6D1S7A", "B00CDV4OEC", "B00D80GMP6"], "bought_together": ["B000A0GOEQ", "B000TLTCT0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000WNHTCC", "B0009X770E", "B000FWHW90", "B006TTC5J0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 49383}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 34.99, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B000GRUQJW", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51WPATK4SWL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Hollywood's Legends of Horror Collection (Doctor X / The Return of Doctor X / Mad Love / The Devil Doll / Mark of the Vampire / The Mask of Fu Manchu)"}

{"description": "Mission ImpossibleA flashy, splashy summer-movie blockbuster that's fun and exciting without being mindless? That's the impossible mission accomplished by director Brian De Palma, star-coproducer Tom Cruise, and the crack team ofMission: Impossible. Based on the '60s TV show and an almost impenetrably complex (but nonetheless thrilling) original story by David Koepp (Jurassic Park) and Steven Zaillian (Schindler's List), with a screenplay by Koepp and Robert Towne (Chinatown, Shampoo),Mission: Impossiblebegins with veteran agent Jim Phelps (Jon Voight) and his expert crew embarking on a mission that goes horribly, horribly wrong. But nothing is what it seems. The nail-biting set piece--always a signature of director De Palma (Carrie, The Untouchables)--in which Cruise is lowered from the ceiling to retrieve information from a computer in a high-security vault--is an instant classic. But perhaps even more impressive, at least in retrospect, is a flashback sequence in which two characters attempt to reconstruct a series of events from multiple points of view. It's pretty daring and sophisticated stuff for a big-budget spy movie, but brains were always what put theMission: Impossibleteam ahead of the competition, anyway, no? --Jim EmersonMission Impossible IIVisually stunning, and a likely must for John Woo aficionados, the secondMission: Impossibleouting from megastar Tom Cruise suffers from an inconsistent tone and tired plot devices--not only recycled from other films, but repeated throughout the film. Despite remarkable cinematography and awe-inspiring, trademark Woo photography, the movie offers a tepid story from legendary screenwriter-director Robert Towne (Chinatown, Without Limits) and a host of other writers, most uncredited.It is, regrettably, as forgettable as the first big-budget, big box-officeMIin 1996, and it's clear (as Towne confirms) that the plot was developed around Woo- and Cruise-written action sequences. The film combines equal elements of romance and action, and is best when it features the stunning allure of Thandie Newton as Nyah, a master thief recruited by the sinewy charms of Ethan Hunt (a fit Cruise). Deeply in love after a passionate night, the couple must then combat MI nemesis (and Nyah's former lover) Sean Ambrose (Ever After's Dougray Scott). Ambrose holds hostage a virus and its cure, and offers them to the highest bidder.Woo's famed mythic filmmaking is far from subtle, with heroic Hunt frequently slow-motion walking through fire, smoke, or other similar devices, replete with a white dove among pigeons to signal his presence. The emphasis on romance is an attempt to develop character and a more human side to superspy Hunt, but still the dreary story proves a distraction from the exciting action sequences. John Polson (as an MI team member) is an Aussie talent to keep an eye on. --N.F. MendozaMission Impossible IIIAt the time of its release,Mission: Impossible III's box office was plagued by the publicity backlash against couch-jumping star Tom Cruise. It's too bad, because this third installment of the spy thriller franchise deserved a better reception than it got. First-time feature director J.J. Abrams (bigwig TV director/producer ofLost, Alias, & Felicity) proves more than able-bodied in creating a Mission: Impossible that's leaner and less over-stylized than John Woo's sequel and less confusing than Brian De Palma's original. Plot is still a throwaway here (Cruise's Ethan Hunt rescues his kidnapped former trainee and works to steal a device that... well, we don't really know what it does, but it's something about mass destruction that costs $850 million), but the action sequences, particularly one where Ethan faces down a helicopter on a bridge and gets flung hard against the side of a car, are particularly impressive since Cruise, at 44, is still doing most of his own stunts and shows no hint of the weathered look that's struck his action-star peers. (Though noMission: Impossiblestunt will ever be quite as simultaneously nail-biting and funny as the first film's wire-dangling break-in of CIA headquarters.)Mission: Impossible IIIboasts a pedigreed cast, particularly Oscar&#xAE; winner Philip Seymour Hoffman (Capote) as baddie arms dealer Owen Davian. Hoffman plays Owen all teeth-clenched and cool, especially when threatening to kill Ethan in front of his lovely new wife (Michelle Monaghan) who has no idea of his spy life. But in his first action-film lead role, Hoffman's almost too calm and collected to really make a memorable villain, especially when the rest of the cast--Ving Rhames (the only other cast member to return for all three films), Asian film star Maggie Q, and an underused Jonathan Rhys-Meyers--are a highlight as Ethan's IMF team.Mission: Impossibleis still fun popcorn spy fare, and if Cruise chooses to end the franchise here, at least he goes out on a high note. --Ellen A.

{"description": "This clever, funny big-screen adaptation of Lauren Weisberger's best-seller takes some of the snarky bite out of the chick lit book, but smoothes out the characters' boxy edges to make a more satisfying movie. There's no doubtThe Devil Wears Prada belongs to Meryl Streep, who turns in an Oscar&#65533;-worthy (seriously!) strut as the monster editor-in-chief ofRunway, an elite fashion magazine full of size-0, impossibly well-dressed plebes. This makes new second-assistant Andrea (Anne Hathaway), who's smart but an unacceptable size 6, stick out like a sore thumb. Streep has a ball sending her new slave on any whimsical errand, whether it's finding the seventh (unpublished) Harry Potter book or knowing what type she means when she wants \"skirts.\" Though Andrea thumbs her nose at the shallow world of fashion (she's only doing the job to open doors to a position atThe New Yorker someday), she finds herself dually disgusted yet seduced by the perks of the fast life. The film sends a basic message: Make work your priority, and you'll be rich and powerful... and lonely. Any other actress would have turned Miranda into a scenery-chewing Cruella, but Streep's underplayed, brilliant comic timing make her a fascinating, unapologetic character. Adding frills to the movie's fun are Stanley Tucci as Streep's second-in-command, Emily Blunt (My Summer of Love) as the overworked first assistant, Simon Baker as a sexy writer, and breathtaking couture designs any reader ofVogue would salivate over. --Ellen A.

Lois, however, has moved on: she now has a fianc&#xE9; (James Marsden), a son (Tristan Leabu), and a Pulitzer Prize for her article entitled \"Why the World Doesn't Need Superman.\" On top of this emotional curveball, his old archrival Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) is plotting the biggest land grab in history.Singer, who made a strong impression among comic-book fans for his work on the X-Men franchise and directed Spacey inThe Usual Suspects, brings both a fresh eye and a sense of respect to the world's oldest superhero. He borrows John Williams's great theme music and Marlon Brando's voice as Jor-El, and the story (penned by Singer'sX-Mencollaborators Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris) is a sort-of-sequel to the first two films in the franchise (choosing to ignore that the third and fourth movies ever happened). The humorous and romantic elements give the movie a heart, Singer's art-deco Metropolis is often breathtaking, and the special effects are elegant and spectacular, particularly an early airplane-disaster set-piece. Of the cast, Routh is excellent as the dual Superman/Clark, Spacey is both droll and vicious as Luthor, and Parker Posey gets the best lines as Luthor's moll Kitty. But at 23, Bosworth seems too young for the five-years-past-grizzled Lois. It's nice to see Noel Neill, Jack Larson (both from the classicAdventures of SupermanTV series), and Eva Marie-Saint on the screen as well. Superman Returns is one of those projects that was in development for seemingly forever, but it was worth the wait -- it's the most enjoyable superhero movie sinceSpider-Man 2andThe Incredibles.--David HoriuchiMore SupermanWatch our exclusive interviews with the cast ofSuperman ReturnsOther feature filmsSuperman in high definitionSmallvilleAdventures of SupermanSee all Superman DVDs", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001DJLD2G", "B000IJ79VQ", "B000IJ79X4", "B000IJ79XE", "B000IJ79WU", "B008JFUPFI", "B000IJ79UW", "B001CDR1FG", "B000ION23U", "B002GSXKN8", "B004EPZ07K", "B0000959N0", "B00005JNTU", "B004LWZWFQ", "B001DHXT20", "B000VI70QS", "B0006L0LOS", "B0007P0Y7C", "B000UR9T8C", "B00005JNJV", "B00005JMQW", "B00005JKCH", "B000AYELVU", "B004LWZW42", "B0090SI56Y", "B001OST0LW", "B001OST0M6", "B001QB9H1U", "B000HCO83Q", "B000PE0G0A", "B001GCUO1Q", "B0002IQMAM", "B004LWZWGA", "B008JFUS0U", "B000P0J06K", "B000OVLBF8", "B00E5I2MCM", "B003YAR97K", "B001GZ6QC4", "B00080ZG2O", "B003QO8TOQ", "B001FB55HQ", "B005LAIGW8", "B000I8OM94", "B000FO0AHY", "B00IZZDWKM", "B000P0J06U", "B0007V6ITE", "B008JFUO72", "B000AYELVA", "B002NXSRVG", "B00DYEN6XC", "B00E5I2MEK", "B000BT96EG", "B001HQZJMU", "B001QTXM5Y", "B00E5I2M6I", "B002HWRYJE", "B00E5I2M9K", "B001614E68", "B000059Z8L", "B001VLBDD0", "B000EU1Q3Q", "B000EU1Q2M", "B000KJU1KK", "B00BTYMPUY", "B000H30B2C", "B001F7MSFM", "B0013BM63O", "B00F4FFO8E", "B000EGDB10", "B00008G8M5", "B00JPS7HOA", "0790738953", "B000B7QCGS", "B000HWZ4E8", "B00BBXSPES", "B000FMGTTE", "B0083SBMBM", "B003Z8ZCDO", "B005LAII44", "B000P6XQ50", "B000VI28Z6", "B00AZMFJYA", "B001RHGRT8", "B000F4RH8E", "B002ZG99B8", "B001AK3S4Y", "B00005JL78", "B0002ZMHX6", "B0007G89FU", "B006VRRGNK", "B00BBAQD6S", "B009JBWOU0", "B000BT96FA", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B00BGI086Q", "B003UN2ICM", "B0000VCZMK"], "bought_together": ["B008JFUPFI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B008JFUPFI", "B00F4FFO8E", "B001DJLD2G", "B000IJ79UW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 57565}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.73, "brand": "DC Comics", "asin": "B000J10EQU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Ddmxk8VML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Superman Returns (Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "Out patrolling a California highway, police officer Edward Malus (Nicolas Cage) stops a station wagon to return a little girl's lost doll. Moments later, a runaway truck slams into the station wagon, igniting it into a fiery wreck with the mother and child trapped inside. Edward fails to save them before the car explodes...and then spends months of his life choking down pills to get the image of their faces out of his head. But Edward is about to get a second chance. A desperate letter from his former girlfriend, Willow (Kate Beahan), arrives at his home with no postmark. Willow came into his life and left just as unexpectedly years before. But now, her daughter Rowan has gone missing, and Edward is theonly person she trusts to help locate her. She asks him to come to her home on a private island - Summersisle - a place with its own traditions where people observe a forgotten way of life. Edward seizes the opportunity to make his life right again, and soon finds himself on a seaplane bound for the islands of the Pacific Northwest. But nothing is what it seems on isolated Summersisle, where a culture, dominated by its matriarch Sister Summersisle (Ellen Burstyn), is bound together by arcane traditions and a pagan festival called \"the Day of Death and Rebirth.\" The secretive people of Summersisle only ridicule his investigation, insisting that a child named Rowan never existed there... or if she ever did was no longer alive. But what Edward doesn't know is that Willow's plea for help has invited more into his life than a chance for redemption. In unraveling Summersisle's closely held secrets, Edward is drawn into a web of ancient traditions and murderous deceit, and each step he takes closer to the lost child brings him one step closer to the unspeakable. And one step closer to the Wicker Man.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001J710Y8", "B000PMFRZQ", "B002TVQ48K", "B000GRUMRS", "B0073U2ETK", "B001J710Z2", "B004EPYZOO", "B00012QLB4", "B000TGJ8CQ", "B001KRVLCI", "B000CSUNQQ", "B001GCUO02", "B00AEBB8JM", "B000CFYAMC", "6304806434", "B004XFZ4JK", "B000OVLBF8", "B000BBOUW2", "B000BYA5G4", "B000059TG6", "B004EI2NMM", "B00BFNJHCI", "B00004Z4WR", "B001KKU9CI", "0792838068", "6304711891", "B003ZD9DSO", "B00BJB2GZG", "B00003CXIV", "6305760403", "B00BTYMPX6", "B000U7169M", "B00IKM5LXG", "B001DZOC6Y", "B007IUEEA2", "B00062IDGK", "B00003CXXG", "B003YF9PX6", "B00092ZLSK", "B00005JLRE", "B000TJ6PBK", "B00441GZ00", "B005F2JRUC", "0792844831", "B000FI8MPW", "B0000AGWMF", "B00005JN5E", "0767810856", "B000YNFXZA", "B000OVLBGM", "B00006LPGP", "B00020HAX8", "B0010YVCB6", "B0009X763M", "B00005JP3R", "B000RZGHSM", "B000EHRVP6", "B00008L3UF", "B000286S1U", "B00DNJ95S8", "B009L79YFU", "B00KCTG4PO", "B005DR64OQ", "B0019X3YX2", "B000RZGHSW", "B00406UK7S", "B000JLTRIQ", "B003UMW63O", "B0047T74CM", "B000ALM40I", "B008XAT0TQ", "B002GHHHKG", "B009XTF8KQ", "B001OST0M6", "B009IV2Z3M", "B002ZG99KO", "B00E8G5HNM", "B0002DB5PO", "B00HOGBXS6", "B008DVJOQ4", "B004SIP92O", "B00AEBBA2W", "B00I9H3VTS", "B0011NVC98", "B001JNNDJM", "B000W1SZA4", "B00FEHCQEC", "B00AEFYYH6", "B005LAIGW8", "B00005JNNT", "B004CQZFH6", "B000U1ZV62", "B000RGN2JI", "B003L20IEW", "B00006FDBT", "B00004Y87O", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00803PFZO", "B00GOYC3I8"], "bought_together": ["B001J710Y8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001J710Y8", "B00004Z4WR", "B002TVQ48K", "B000PMFRZQ"]}, "price": 9.33, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 75218}, "asin": "B000JYW5DM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51TT3AM10VL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Wicker Man (Full Screen Unrated/Rated Edition)"}
{"description": "First screened in Europe and scheduled for limited release in the U.S.,Bandidascan now be viewed by all fans of the visually stunning duo, Penelope Cruz and Salma Hayek. Set in Mexico 1888,Bandidasis a Western spoof about two women, Maria Alvarez (Penelope Cruz) and Sara Sandoval (Salma Hayek), who seek to avenge the tragedies befallen both their fathers under robber baron, Tyler Jackson (Dwight Yoakam). Jackson, employed by the Bank of New York, is sent to Mexico to buy land and open banks to the detriment of local culture. Jackson kills Sara's corrupt father, Don Diego, while bandits burn down Maria's home. The two ladies band together for the community's cause. Under the tutelage of Bill Buck (Sam Sheperd), Sara and Maria develop bank robbery skills. When criminologist, Quentin Cooke (Steve Zahn), hunts them, they convert him with their strong moral sense and good looks. Like anyThelma and Louise-ish tale of women who take charge, Maria and Sara are foil characters who eventually become an invincible, sisterly team. This comedy is built around their bickering. For Sara, with European education and penchant of designer clothing, Maria is a hick who lacks refinement, yet Maria, horse whisperer, can fire a gun. The slapstick is overkill, for example when Sara wonders whether a bandana is Gucci or Prada. However, viewers will love Penelope Cruz on horseback and the two actresses practice-kissing their foe in a brothel.Bandidasis a light film with some laughs and mucho sex appeal.  --Trinie DaltonBeyondBandidasMore Films from Salma HayekMore Films from Penelope CruzMore Comic WesternsStills fromBandidas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B005Z9MFWC", "B008LC8V1Y", "B000FIHN5M", "B0000A2ZU1", "B0000WN140", "B0007KZQAM", "B001OXLGJQ", "B00005LMAL", "B00005N91C", "B0000ZG0NQ", "B00005LZOD", "076780421X", "0767817710", "B000067J24", "B004SIP7S0", "B004P7CN5O", "B000085OXZ", "B0006J27WO", "B007P1PQUG", "B004QI14KW", "B00E8AVNAE", "B00AEFZ2DG", "B0000A2ZTY", "B000ASDFI6", "B000KX0HIW", "B0045HCIYA", "B00J49R1BY", "B0000X2EIS", "B005LAII94", "B002ZG98C8", "B00F3TDA6O", "B000F8O2QU", "B0019K4YT8", "B000BITVBA", "B0048LVDHG", "B00HEPC0TS", "B00005YUNT", "B003VADSJG", "B000U1ZV80", "B0001FVECM", "B000059H7K", "B00HRUQ8HK", "B000CEXGAU", "B002ZG98KK", "B002ZG984Q", "B00HW3LAF2", "B00BLN4V5A", "B002C4N66M", "B004LS6CNG", "B0050MB57U", "B00B6OEB18", "B00008CMSX", "B0010DM3R4", "B006OALDLA", "B00IKM5L6I", "B0048LVDGM", "B00EON8RHM", "B00IOFDJWY", "B000GIW9I2", "B00003L9BB", "B003NF97MQ", "B007C4ZJ0S", "B00016MSV2", "B0001CNRRU", "B001U0HB5Q", "B000KLQUSU", "B00APUAKYG", "B001AZW73M", "B0002S64TQ", "B000FAOCC2", "0783229402", "B00024JC30", "B00HOGBXS6", "B003Y5H5C4", "B000ARXF96", "B00DS79HD8", "B002U4UYZK", "B0007UDC80", "6305213283", "B000E8JO3C", "B000053VBV", "B003AWRMCE", "B00005JMWP", "B003YOZNBU", "B00JBGSHSQ", "B00E8G5H8W", "6305504024", "6304884400", "B000FUTVLY", "B006LOBZSA", "B002S5N052", "B00003CXXY", "B001MTYRKC", "B000Y7U94G", "B005LAII44", "B0002J4X2K", "B004A8ZWSS", "B00006ZXSI", "B0045HCIYU", "B00GSTHC7G"], "bought_together": ["B005Z9MFWC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005Z9MFWC", "B004SIP7S0", "B008LC8V1Y", "B000FIHN5M"]}, "price": 9.38, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 66506}, "asin": "B000K7VHNW", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Z7581WDEL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Bandidas"}
{"description": "Eugene Barkley, we hardly knew ye. The youngest of the Barkley sons (quick--who portrayed him? That's right; Charles Briles) is nowhere to be found inThe Big Valley's sophomore season. But lawyer Jarrod (Richard Long), hot-headed Nick (Peter Breck), soulful \"bastard son\" Heath (Lee Majors), and coltish daughter Audra (Linda Evans) get into all the trouble and two-fisted action they can handle. And there's nothing the close-knit Barkleys, headed by matriarch Victoria (regally billed as \"Miss Barbara Stanwyck\") can't handle, whether it's defending the family name against the false accusations of an unscrupulous, grudge-bearing politician, rescuing Heath from a Mexican prison, or being abandoned in the desert. The drama of Heath's heritage, a focus of season 1, is settled once and for all in the season opener, \"The Lost Treasure,\" in which a con man claims to be Heath's father. By episode's end, even Nick is calling Heath \"brother.\"Season 2 boasts an impressive roster of character actors, several at the beginning of their careers. Buddy Hackett, sporting a Lucky Charms leprechaun brogue, is the con man in \"The Lost Treasure,\" with Bruce Dern as one of his marks, and Dub Taylor tending a ghost town bar. Colleen Dewhurst guest stars in the episode \"A Day of Terror, as outlaw Annie Morton, who holds Victoria and Audra hostage while her injured son recuperates in a church. James Whitmore is the mud-slinging candidate in \"Target.\" Warren Oates heads a band of bumbling brothers trying to open a stubborn railroad station safe in \"The Great Safe Robbery.\" And that's the future Jan Brady, Eve Plumb as a little girl trapped in a well in \"Hide the Children,\" an excellent episode that deals with intolerance as gypsy-hating Nick gets a change of attitude when he accompanies a gypsy bride and her family to her wedding.The Big Valleywas never a ratings rival to the venerableGunsmokeorBonanza, which still ruled the prime time roost in 1966. But Western buffs will feel right at home with this sprawling family saga and its larger than life characters. Buyers, though, will be paying a higher premium for the Barkley property this time around.  Priced the same as the season 1 set, this collection contains only the first 15 episodes of season 2 and no extra features.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000EHSVB4", "B00JEZWRE4", "B00HQLZCIQ", "B0002W4TVM", "B001JAHPMG", "B006ZL1P84", "B005D7E7Y0", "B000PHX5KU", "B007V973KI", "B00KB01N4G", "B000EOR0BY", "B004HHX9T6", "B001NRPQK8", "B00IP965IO", "B008BT98LO", "B008KZX766", "B00A73ANHA", "B00A92MBIS", "B00CD45JDE", "B00KB01OG8", "B000NOIX7U", "B00C81AWAM", "B0064CT90U", "B000NY1EAI", "B000H7JCHI", "B006OS1BCI", "B007AAF3FK", "B000F9T70K", "B005LVIOYM", "B00E1HIX2A", "B00CL151ZU", "B000EQ46H8", "B004L5GY82", "B00CL151P0", "B00KTZALDC", "B0013LRKVM", "B00A4F5A60", "B000W8OM68", "B001E6JC1W", "B005LVIP1E", "B00B00HUC0", "B001TWT0CW", "B002OID4T0", "B007MMIMSQ", "B000VS6R3A", "B00IS6WQ2S", "B003XEKXYI", "B00668IFWA", "B003VKVTL0", "B00AWWX7X8", "B0044RFTDI", "B005D7E7PY", "B000TQZBNQ", "B00A6SZRT0", "B005PTYPK2", "B009DA74DY", "B001E6HUXO", "B0007MANZS", "B000BITUYI", "B002FG9N4Q", "B0046S8MRU", "B00BAXTY9O", "B008OIQZ36", "B0083TUEDS", "B0038P1D5K", "B00H7BJ1I2", "B00H7BJ0WO", "B00KW02JW0", "B009OE2NZI", "B009OE2NS0", "B00BAXTYGW", "B002C07AU4", "B008F283Y0", "B0057IY55Q", "B00E96AWY0", "B000BITUZC", "B006OS1B0A", "B003RHZ666", "B00BLN4V2I", "B00I1GUS0C", "B004T0XYLE", "B0025Y3SZS", "B00J9BZ4KC", "B005UFUU6E", "B0026NC61A", "B0013LRKY4", "B00DOZNIVG", "B0001NBND4", "B005LFQRTC", "B00IU6HPIQ", "B00BXTDVEO", "B00BLN4UVU", "B006W95BWA", "B00F6D62O4", "B00AX5B0RY", "B005HMHPHC", "B00E96AY20", "B00AA8Q0JM", "B0007PALOI", "B009ERK2UI"], "bought_together": ["B000EHSVB4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00HQLZCIQ", "B000EHSVB4", "B00JEZWRE4", "B00GHH9HW2"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 70732}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 11.2, "brand": "20TH Century Fox", "asin": "B000K7VHOQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51bxInX2tGL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Big Valley - Season 2, Volume 1"}
{"description": "Steve Martin's funniest three films,The Jerk, The Lonely Guy, and Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid, are collected in the Wild and Crazy Comedy Collectionwith some corny bonus material that pales in comparison to Martin's stunning comedic performances. InThe Lonely Guy, Martin's dejected character wanders New York streets with his fern plant searching for a lady to love. Scenes in which Martin calls his lady from his rooftop amidst scores of other lonely guys, or jogs into a diner wearing fake, spray-on sweat, seem more slapstick with each viewing. Martin's masterpiece isThe Jerk, about Navin Johnson, a white guy born a \"poor black child,\" who sets out for the city to become somebody. Navin, with hobo rucksack in tow, takes his dad's three rules--Don't trust whitey, Lord loves a workin' man, and See a doctor and get rid of it--to an extreme, after becoming a millionaire from inventing a reading glasses apparatus. Co-starring Bernadette Peters,The Jerk'sbizarre humor still feels fresh in its satirical examination of race and class.

{"description": "The history of hardcore punk--the tougher, faster, and more politically minded stepchild of the '70s punk movement that arose in the '80s--is examined in exuberant detail in Paul Rachman's documentaryAmerican Hardcore. Rachman's cameras careen across the landscape of the U.S. to trace the movement's beginnings in cities like Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., and New York, and cherrypicks interviews with the musicians that helped shape its sound and impact, including Henry Rollins and Greg Ginn of Black Flag, H.R. (frontman for the highly influential, all-African American outfit Bad Brains), Ian MacKaye of Minor Threat (and now Fugazi), and many others. Hardcore's violent reaction against the Reagan administration and the complacent mindset of middle-class America is also detailed in countless performance footage clips and poster-art reproductions, which do much to dismiss the popular opinion of hardcore as nothing more than mindless hooliganism. Some fans may find the omission of certain bands a considerable oversight (San Francisco's lethally satirical Dead Kennedys are not mentioned only in passing), but for most punk devotees,American Hardcorewill be vital and essential viewing. The DVD includes several deleted scenes and bonus performances, commentary by Rachman and writer Steven Blush (whose book of the same name provided the inspiration for the film), and a gallery of photos from photographer Edward Colver, who covered the hardcore scene in detail during its heyday.-- Paul GaitaStills fromAmerican Hardcore(click for larger image)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001BTODPM", "B0002NRS0U", "B0035CVB2G", "1932595899", "B00465I1B0", "B009ES41TK", "0767837398", "B00IGL2M9C", "B00003CXHM", "B000642JG8", "B001AR4K6C", "B00JQYUXTE", "B000HWZ5XS", "B001ECDVIG", "B000001Q3T", "B000000JO3", "B000000LZ2", "1604864184", "B005Z4D2EC", "B005CM3HLK", "B0035CVB1W", "B00B8VX82W", "B00CPTUMO8", "B000BR9S96", "0802142648", "B000063UQN", "B0081L6NH4", "B00118SUIO", "0991344707", "B000EGEJIY", "B00004TBTH", "B0017WI5W0", "0922915709", "B0007IO740", "B002IJQ2YY", "B007LNJ62C", "1550229567", "B000000HSU", "B00104AYGU", "1402779372", "B002RVZV9K", "B000000LZL", "B004H0B0G2", "B0034PJWJ8", "B000GTLB12", "B00004YLAP", "B000000I32", "B000000LZO", "B000A0GP4K", "B00D5XC8PE", "B00004YZFR", "B00005LO66", "B000GI3RKQ", "B007GFYC0Q", "B000A2H2QI", "B00006JU7P", "1560257695", "B00005JGAF", "B000CNESU8", "097961631X", "0316787531", "B0000AINHF", "B000000M3J", "B000000M2J", "B00267N3FO", "B007QD0UP4", "B002QC7Y4U", "B0006L0LM0", "B004GGU9KK", "B00009QI2F", "B0009YNSLK", "B002QZ2DPW", "B00A3A3V0I", "B000LEB7LG", "B00AEBB8XS", "B001NY71F4", "B001MFNB5I", "B000009NXI", "B0007L6PRY", "B000SQLC2G", "1901447707", "B000008M4F"], "bought_together": ["B001BTODPM", "B0002NRS0U"], "buy_after_viewing": ["1932595899", "B0002NRS0U", "B0035CVB2G", "B00AEBBADG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 61028}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 7.51, "brand": "Unknown", "asin": "B000LPR6FQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RdpcO-OEL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "American Hardcore - The History of Punk Rock 1980 - 1986"}

{"description": "Martin Scorsese makes a welcome return to the mean streets (of Boston, in this case) withThe Departed, hailed by many as Scorsese's best film sinceCasino. Since this crackling crime thriller is essentially a Scorsese-stamped remake of the acclaimed 2002 Hong Kong thrillerInfernal Affairs, the film was intensely scrutinized by devoted critics and cinephiles, and while Scorsese's intense filmmaking and all-star cast deserve ample acclaim,The Departedis also worthy of serious re-assessment, especially with regard to what some attentive viewers described as sloppy craftsmanship (!), notably in terms of mismatched shots and jagged continuity. But no matter where you fall on the Scorsese appreciation scale, there's no denying thatThe Departedis a signature piece of work from one of America's finest directors, designed for maximum impact with a breathtaking series of twists, turns, and violent surprises. It's an intricate cat-and-mouse game, but this time the cat and mouse are both moles: Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) is an ambitious cop on the rise, planted in the Boston police force by criminal kingpin Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a hot-tempered police cadet who's been artificially disgraced and then planted into Costello's crime operation as a seemingly trustworthy soldier. As the multilayered plot unfolds (courtesy of a scorching adaptation byKingdom of Heavenscreenwriter William Monahan), Costigan and Sullivan conduct a volatile search for each other (they're essentially looking for \"themselves\") while simultaneously wooing the psychiatrist (Vera Farmiga) assigned to treat their crime-driven anxieties.Such convenient coincidences might sink a lesser film, butThe Departedis so electrifying that you barely notice the plot-holes. And while Nicholson's profane swagger is too much \"Jack\" and not enough \"Costello,\" he's still a joy to watch, especially in a film that's additionally energized by memorable (and frequently hilarious) supporting roles for Alec Baldwin, Mark Wahlberg, and a host of other big-name performers.The Departedalso makes clever and plot-dependent use of cell-phones, to the extent that it couldn't exist without them. Powered by Scorsese's trademark use of well-chosen soundtrack songs (from vintage rock to Puccini's operas),The Departedmay not be perfect, but it's one helluva ride for moviegoers, proving popular enough to become the biggest box-office hit of Scorsese's commercially rocky career.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002ZG99N6", "B000P0J09M", "B004SIP7TE", "B004SIP8ZM", "B002ZG980U", "B002VWNIEA", "B00011CZRE", "B00AEBB8NI", "B002T9H2LA", "B00005JLSB", "B000MZHW40", "B00080ZG10", "B003ASLJQS", "B000P0J0AG", "B000P0J0EW", "B000C20VPA", "B003UESJHO", "B004SIP7ZS", "B003ASLJO0", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B002CPMB9O", "B00AHTYI5M", "B00275EGWY", "B000XR9L50", "B000A3XY5A", "B0007DFJ0G", "B001N44BVQ", "B00003CXWV", "B008MILL8W", "B000286RP2", "B004SIP7VM", "B00005V9HH", "6305313687", "B00AEBB9NM", "B004FQX5B6", "B00AEFXKUI", "B004SIP95G", "B00AEBB86A", "B005LAIIJY", "B0016Q2D66", "B003ASLJQI", "B00008975Z", "B000IY04Q8", "B001P9KR8U", "B00005JNJV", "B000C20VRS", "B008R65XYC", "B005LAIGRS", "B00H9KKGTO", "B00008DP4C", "B00AEBB9F0", "B00AEFY5B6", "B00005JN0W", "B005LAIGLE", "B000A2UBN4", "B002QEHPQU", "B000P0J0EM", "B003UESJH4", "B007D5E7C2", "6304765258", "B000P0J0D8", "B00AEFY0XE", "B00004WG2F", "0767830555", "B000LC55F2", "B002O3Z4Y8", "B004EPYZP8", "B000A7DVR2", "B00005JPD0", "B000WZEZGI", "B00049QQHI", "B000FS9FCG", "B00004XPPB", "B006OFN0SE", "B009AMAL4Y", "B004U7MR14", "B000GFLKF8", "B003AWRMCE", "B0019L770A", "B00BEIYN9Q", "B0000AM6JI", "B004SIP9Z6", "B001GZ6QC4", "0783240295", "B0010DR4BO", "B000065U1N", "B00001ZWUS", "B00BB67UNW", "B0000B1OFL", "B00AEBB9K0", "B00DHDDE32", "B00005JKWX", "B0051MKNV8", "B002ZG97RE", "0767802519", "B0034G4P94", "B00DHHWXYY", "B00005B6JZ", "B00003CXZ4", "B001TODCII"], "bought_together": ["B000P0J09M"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000RETOHY", "B000P0J09M", "B000P0J0EW", "B00AEBB8NI"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 5067}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.5, "brand": "Warner Bros", "asin": "B000M341QE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RZnzpL34L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "Brilliantly conceived, superbly directed, and beautifully acted,Babelis inarguably one of the best films of 2006. Director Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu and his co-writer, Guillermo Arriaga (the two also collaborated onAmores Perrosand21 Grams) weave together the disparate strands of their story into a finely hewn fabric by focusing on what appear to be several equally incongruent characters: an American (Brad Pitt) touring Morocco with his wife (Cate Blanchett) become the focus of an international incident also involving a hardscrabble Moroccan farmer (Mustapha Rachidi) struggling to keep his two young sons in line and his family together. A San Diego nanny (Adriana Barraza), her employers absent, makes the disastrous decision to take their kids with her to a wedding in Mexico. And a deaf-mute Japanese teen (the extraordinary Rinko Kikuchi) deals with a relationship with her father (Koji Yakusho) and the world in general that's been upended by the death of her mother. It is perhaps not surprising, or particularly original, that a gun is the device that ties these people together. YetBabelisn't merely about violence and its tragic consequences. It's about communication, and especially the lack of it--both intercultural, raising issues like terrorism and immigration, and intracultural, as basic as husbands talking to their wives and parents understanding their children. I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu's command of his medium, sound and visual alike, is extraordinary; the camera work is by turns kinetic and restrained, the music always well matched to the scenes, the editing deft but not confusing, and the film (which clocks in at a lengthy 143 minutes) is filled with indelible moments. Many of those moments are also pretty stark and grim, and no will claim that all of this leads to a \"happy\" ending, but there is a sense of reconciliation, perhaps even resolution. \"If You Want to be Understood... Listen,\" goes the tagline. And if you want a movie that will leave you thinking,Babelis it.--Sam GrahamBeyondBabelOther Interweaving Storylines on DVDOther DVDs by Director Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rrituWhy We Love Cate BlanchettStills fromBabel(click for larger image)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0001CNRRU", "B00005N8A9", "B0041KKYF6", "B000A3XY5A", "B000F7CMRM", "B000067IZ3", "B00005JL57", "B00AEFXESQ", "B001P9KR8U", "B000N6TX1I", "B001JIE7JC", "B00005JPKE", "B00AEFXQ9S", "B00005JMJ4", "B0010DR4BO", "B000NIVJF4", "B000NIVJFY", "B000F1IQN2", "B00HF98SPS", "B0045ZAQRS", "B00011CZRE", "B000N3T0DW", "B002O3Z4Z2", "B000MZHW40", "B004SIP6VI", "B0034G4P30", "B008JFUNKU", "B003ASLJQS", "B000E1NXJ0", "B004SIP6GI", "B00AEBB89W", "B00275EGWY", "B000IONJM4", "B00H9KKGTO", "B00003CWTI", "B00080Z53O", "B00005JNCZ", "B00114XTHA", "B00GUO2SKA", "B00112S8RS", "B001PPLJIQ", "B000MXPE7O", "B00102F5WK", "B00121QGPY", "B0016Q2D66", "B002J1RZHE", "B008220DGE", "B000O76ZQC", "B0013XZ6X4", "B00080ZG10", "B00337KM2S", "B000286RP2", "B004SIP8ZM", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00005JMJG", "B00005Q4CS", "B00AEBB9CS", "B00G4Q3KOC", "B0036TGSJE", "B001TOD92C", "B000OY8NBK", "B004XVMCKS", "B00GMV8M2Y", "B00005JLRE", "B00005JH9M", "B00004WG2F", "B00AEBB8SS", "B00005JKJA", "B00H9HZITU", "B000YENUI6", "B0041KKYDI", "B001MZ5W3M", "B000N3SU92", "B000EQHXNW", "B0041KKYEM", "B001LLH8SE", "B0007TKOAA", "B000P0J0BK", "B002S5N052", "B004SIP7S0", "B00AEBB8NI", "B002SJIO4A", "B000CQLZ0Q", "B000E33VWW", "B000M341QE", "B002VWNICC", "B001NFNFNU", "6305313687", "B00005JKTF", "B00FZ4KR4U", "B00008K7AO", "B00DL48BM6", "079073639X", "B00H83EUQW", "B000FVQLRA", "B0002TT0MI", "B00AHTYI5M", "B00H9L26AA", "B00003CWRX", "B002FHGESI"], "bought_together": ["B00005N8A9", "B0041KKYF6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000A3XY5A", "B0001CNRRU", "B0041KKYF6", "B00G4Q3KOC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 100262}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.22, "brand": "Paramount Home Video", "asin": "B000MCH5P4", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51poif023LL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Babel"}

{"description": "It takes a certain kind of comic genius to create a character who is, to quote the classic Sondheim lyric, appealing and appalling. But be forewarned:Boratis not \"something for everyone.\" It arrives as advertised as one of the most outrageous, most offensive, and funniest films in years. Kazakhstan journalist Borat Sagdiyev (Sacha Baron Cohen reprising the popular character from hisDa Ali G Show), leaves his humble village to come to \"U.S. and A\" to film a documentary. After catching an episode ofBaywatchin his New York hotel room, he impulsively scuttles his plans and, accompanied by his fat,hirsute producer (Hardy to his Laurel), proceeds to California to pursue the object of his obsession, Pamela Anderson.Boratis not about how he finds America; it's about how America finds him in a series of increasingly cringe-worthy scenes. Borat, with his '70s mustache, well-worn grey suit, and outrageously backwards attitudes (especially where Jews are concerned) interacts with a cross-section of the populace, catching them, a la Alan Funt onCandid Camera, in the act of being themselves. Early on, an unwitting humor coach advises Borat about various types of jokes. Borat asks if his brother's retardation is a ripe subject for comedy. The coach patiently replies, \"That would not be funny in America.\" NOT! Borat is subversively, bracingly funny. When it comes to exploring uncharted territory of what is and is not appropriate or politically correct, Borat knows no boundaries, as when he brings a fancy dinner with the southern gentry to a halt after returning from the bathroom with a bag of his feces (\"The cultural differences are vast,\" his hostess graciously/patronizingly offers), or turns cheers to boos at a rodeo when he calls for bloodlust against the Iraqis and mangles \"The Star Spangled Banner.\"Success, John F. Kennedy once said, has a thousand fathers. A paternity test onBoratmight reveal traces of Bill Dana's Jose Jimenez, Andy Kaufman, Michael Moore,The Jamie Kennedy Xperiment, andJackass. Some scenes seem to have been staged (a game Anderson, whom Borat confronts at a book signing, was reportedly in on the setup), but others, as the growing litany of lawsuits attests, were not. All too real is Borat's encounter with loutish Southern frat boys who reveal their sexism and racism, and the disturbing moment when he asks a gun store owner what gun he would recommend to \"kill a Jew\" (a Glock automatic is the matter-of-fact reply). Comedy is not pretty, and inBoratit can get downright ugly, as when Borat and his producer get jiggly with it during a nude fight that spills out from their hotel room into the hallway, elevator, lobby and finally, a mortgage brokers association banquet. High-five! --Donald LiebensonOn the DVD\"Global Visitings\" capturesBorat-mania in all its hype and glory, as Sacha Baron Cohen, never breaking character, promotes his film around the world. On the itinerary isLate Night with Conan O'Brienand the Toronto Film Festival, a now-legendary screening aborted after a projector malfunction. A mixed bag of deleted scenes finds Borat trying to bait more unsuspecting citizens, including an animal-control worker who refuses Borat a dog after he asks, \"How do you recommend I cook this?\" and a doctor who is nonplussed by Borat's obscene medical history. A supermarket visit offers the most maddening fromage-inspired looniness since Monty Python's \"Cheese Shop\" sketch. Also good for a few chuckles are a faux soundtrack commercial and aBaywatchparody (\"Sexydangerwatch\").--Donald LiebensonBeyondBoratAll things Sacha Baron CohenBoratApparelBoratSoundtrackStills fromBorat(click for larger image)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002P7UCJ0", "B005LAIHGI", "B0002ZMITY", "B002OID4WM", "B00020X852", "B000A88ESW", "B000WZEZGI", "B001G5T6GW", "B005LAIHHC", "B00AEFZ8OY", "B002P7UCJA", "B00005JNZU", "B001DPHDB0", "B001J9KJ4I", "B00G2P79BU", "B000J4QW8Q", "B00AEFYS2M", "B00005JMYI", "B002Q4VBPQ", "B0006GANPA", "B001OD4S50", "6305922756", "B003XJABTK", "B00AEBBA2C", "B008R65XNS", "B000BKVQS4", "B00AEBB9K0", "B003CRM6PA", "B000A7DVR2", "B00AEBB8FQ", "B0016MOV92", "B000BKJ762", "B00009W5CA", "B000AP04L0", "B008220BGQ", "B002T9H2LA", "B00068WOH8", "0385523467", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00008975Z", "B004SIP95G", "B00003CXZ1", "0783229526", "B002ZG99N6", "B003VPX5Y4", "B002SJIO4A", "B00005JLQN", "B00AEFY854", "B00005O3VC", "B004XVMCH6", "B000K7VHQE", "B0006HBZEW", "B00005JMUA", "B000VE439Y", "B00AEFXDO6", "B000EMGJAO", "B0000A02TZ", "B00005JNBQ", "B003Y5H5B0", "B00BEIYMZ6", "B004SIP8ZM", "B000MCH5RM", "B000K7VHOG", "B00005ALS0", "B001UV4X8S", "B00009MGEM", "B0001Z4OXS", "B000C20VPA", "B0012IWNZY", "B00CE00ZV8", "B00005QCVX", "B000I0RNVQ", "B000022TSW", "B001TOD92C", "B000P0J09M", "B00005JL78", "B00AEFYAMA", "B00AEFXGIY", "B000J4P9P8", "B000055Y0X", "B004EPZ084", "B001VLBDD0", "B00AEFY5B6", "B006XZWAWM", "B00005JKMN", "B00AEFY0F2", "B000XFVIOO", "B002GSXKOW", "B00006G8HR", "B000HT386M", "B000MQCUJG", "B00007AJF7", "B00005KA6V", "B004SIP9MY", "B00AEBBA72", "B00018D42W", "B000TZJBPQ", "B0009HBPN0", "B004P9UWM8"], "bought_together": ["B005LAIHGI", "B002P7UCJ0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005LAIHGI", "B000WZEZGI", "B002OID4WM", "B000TZJBPQ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 15271}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.29, "brand": "COHEN,SACHA BARON", "asin": "B000MMMT9G", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51uGbGa68JL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan"}
