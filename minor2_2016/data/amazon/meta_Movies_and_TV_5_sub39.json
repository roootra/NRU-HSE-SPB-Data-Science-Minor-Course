{"description": "Francis Ford Coppola's passable 1986 comedy stars Kathleen Turner as an unhappy, middle-aged woman who goes back in time to her high school years and meets her future husband (Nicolas Cage) all over again. A lightweight entry from Coppola (The Godfather,Apocalypse Now), the film has some clever, backward-looking jokes (Turner's character laughs incredulously when someone turns up with a brand-new Edsel); and the lead actress does bring intelligence and searching emotions to her role. Cage (Coppola's nephew), who specialized in these dumb-guy roles back then (seeRaising Arizona), is in sharp, raw form.

{"description": "Despite rave reviews as one of the most stylish and intelligent detective pictures in a number of years, this 1995 adaptation of Walter Mosley's novel never found a mass audience. Too bad, because Carl Franklin's film is nearly perfect in every way, from its rich, shadowy look to its depiction of life in post-World War II black America (L.A.-style) to the acting of Denzel Washington, Don Cheadle, and others. Washington plays Easy Rawlins, an aircraft factory worker who is laid off only to find his true calling: as a private eye, albeit an unlicensed one. Hired to find a missing woman, he becomes entangled in a complex but satisfying case involving sex, corruption, racism, and of course money. Top-notch from top to bottom--and Cheadle is dangerously funny as Easy's best friend, a killer named Mouse.--Marshall Fine", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000542CJ", "6304884400", "B0000549B2", "B00441GZ1Y", "B000244GCC", "B00BTYOYG2", "B0001VTPUO", "B0000VJG72", "B003BV8I3Q", "B0006210ZG", "B00008WJEY", "B004YCKJGU", "B000OT6V0K", "0783230532", "6304765258", "0743451791", "B00005JA9F", "B002GHHHN8", "B00005JPD0", "B000N60HAO", "B00015HVJM", "078324228X", "B00005JLRZ", "630514415X", "0792838076", "B0050MB4OO", "B00005RDAO", "0800177967", "B00125WAWS", "0800141806", "B00L2FSQ08", "B00005AUK9", "B00AEFY6TW", "B0009S4IGA", "B000P0J0CE", "B000BOH8X2", "B000B8TIKY", "B002CPMB9O", "B002LMV7R0", "B00007L4KF", "B00AEFXN9G", "B000GFLKF8", "0743451767", "B00AEFYLBU", "B005KKVAH2", "B00AFEXRME", "B0041QSZS8", "B000002B1D", "B00441GYXI", "B00005JN0W", "0783240295", "B00005JL72", "B00005OSKB", "B00007AJG1", "079074208X", "B00AEBB9N2", "6305505802", "B000244EX8", "B002VWNICC", "B002NZK5UU", "B00441GZ00", "0743451775", "B0000633QV", "B0002V7O5Q", "B005LAIGRS", "B0001XAQ96", "0767811070", "B00005JKWX", "0767818083", "B000065V3J", "B000JJSL1W", "B00124ONGA", "B002VWNIEA", "B00AEFYG3S", "B002CA68N4", "B000XJD34I", "B00005JLX8", "B00066FAQW", "0385535988", "038553597X", "B00005JD5J", "B000059TGC", "B00005U156", "B000ION79E", "B00003L9CG", "B000E40QC4", "B0000TWMQ6", "B004TTOQ4O", "B000VNMMVQ", "6305505780", "B00CP4Y5WS", "0743442547", "B000051YMP", "B002CWKU2M", "B00GOZ2LPM", "0446617903", "B0009GX1CE", "B00005JLG1", "B000GTJSD0", "B000JJSLA8"], "bought_together": ["B00441GZ1Y", "B003BV8I3Q"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001D7T6CM", "B00DDT0J92", "B00128GITG", "6304884400"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 59172}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 44.99, "brand": "WASHINGTON,DENZEL", "asin": "0767818075", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51lYS%2BR4XVL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Devil in A Blue Dress"}

She is also a quick-witted and likable child who can solve almost any problem.

Unlike most youthful movie fare, this adventure boasts high production values that wisely include colorful Parisian locations.

{"description": "What if you could stop your heart to simulate a temporary death, and then be revived so you could describe your near-death experience to others? The mysteries of life--and the afterlife--compel five medical students (Julia Roberts, Kiefer Sutherland, Kevin Bacon, William Baldwin, Oliver Platt) to experiment with their own mortality, and what they discover has unsettling psychological implications. That's the intriguing premise of this neo-Gothic horror thriller, directed by Joel Schumacher (Batman & Robin) with his typical indulgence of vibrant colours and hyperactive, hallucinogenic style. The movie borders on silliness at times, and the near-death recollection of memories results in some repetitious scenes, but the dynamic young cast takes it all quite seriously, which is what keeps this gaudy thriller on the edge. The fascinating premise could have been made into a better film, but Schumacher's mainstream excess doesn't stop Flatliners from being slick, occasionally even provocative entertainment. --Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303909884"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 725731}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.0, "brand": "", "asin": "0767831322", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/517S5SV68ZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Flatliners [VHS]"}

Stars Jackie Chan, Sammo Hung, Chow Yun-Fat, Jet Li, and Michelle Yeoh all appeared in major Hollywood projects and directors John Woo, Ronny Yu, and Tsui Hark directedFace/Off,Bride of Chucky, andKnock Off, respectively. Another entry into this new era of entertainment isThe Big Hit, directed by Che-Kirk Wong (who also directed Jackie Chan inCrime Story), executive produced by John Woo, and produced by Wesley Snipes. Mark Wahlberg leads this all-American cast in a played-for-laughs macho blowout. Rounding out the testosterone brigade are Lou Diamond Phillips (sprouting a gold-capped tooth and a dirty mouth), Bokeem Woodbine (who, according to this DVD's director audio track, wore extra socks where it counts), Antonio Sab&agrave;to Jr., and Avery Brooks. Wahlberg plays Melvin Smiley, a nice-guy hit man with an ulcer and a severe insecurity problem. He's short on cash due to the spending habits of his unsuspecting fianc&eacute;e Pam (Christina Applegate) and his girlfriend-on-the-sly Chantel (Lela Rochon). He and his crew decide to do a little freelancing and cook up their own heist to make a little mo' money--specifically by kidnapping Keiko (China Chow), the daughter of a Japanese businessman whom they target for ransom. Little do they know her dad is broke and she's the goddaughter of their boss.The Big Hithas action scenes aplenty (one of the stunt coordinators worked on Woo'sThe KillerandBullet in the Head) and the same cornball sense of humor as other films in the Hong Kong action genre. Slick pacing and over-the-top humor made this movie a miss with the critics but a fun ride for fans of Hong Kong-styled action.--Shannon Gee", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004P7CMVE", "B000ZS8GWQ", "078322933X", "B00000JGNP", "B00005JLIF", "B001MTYRKC", "B00AEFY0XE", "B002O3Z4Z2", "B001DZOC6Y", "B005LAIGLE", "B00B83PJHM", "B00BB67UNW", "B0000B1OFL", "B00AEBB86A", "B00BEIYLO8", "B000J3OTT6", "B002GIBVVQ", "B00BEIYN9Q", "B003UESJHO", "B00049QQHI", "B000PAAJZ6", "B002ZG99H2", "B0006TPE4C", "B00008G8M5", "B000P0J0C4", "6305899592", "B008E70EES", "B0001FGBWU", "0790732149", "B004ZNLGWO", "B004RA7YW6", "B001QOGYAO", "B00005AVZS", "B000M341QE", "B000MEYKEQ", "B00003L9CQ", "6305645515", "B000BQ7J98", "B00008L3S9", "B00HLSW6II", "B00001PE4D", "B005LAIILM", "B00005K3O1", "B00JRB01RK", "B00AEFYUQQ", "B00H1RMWYW", "B00A4TMLNG", "B000SM6FLI", "B00277Q2V0", "B0000844K3", "B00BUC4TJ0", "B0019EXZY4", "B00DU22OI6", "B005NKIPUY", "6304698747", "B00HLTD3ZW", "B0017DQFB2", "B00005JLQN", "B00JQF7ZR6", "0767835093", "B001KRVLCI", "B00HEPC0TS", "B00JA3RVG4", "B009AMAJPA", "B00HOGBXS6", "B004ULNJIU", "B003L20IG0", "B0045HCJGC", "B0009QTRN6", "0790742004", "B0045HCJ5S", "B000053VAH", "B0009S4II8", "B00AEFY6PQ", "B002AS466O", "B0035G5IZI", "6305922675", "B00DI0135K", "B002ZG97B0", "B004SIP9CO", "B00005JA9F", "B005LAIGRS", "B00005QAOZ", "B001KMB6X2", "B00BLF9FOK", "B002AT8K9W", "1558908382", "B0047T74CM", "B0012EBV6U", "B00000F0AD", "B000AP04FG", "B0007R8E54", "B00004STDN", "B00HEPE6MM", "B0009FU0ZG", "0783227345", "B001AR0D54", "B004HO6HWA"], "bought_together": ["078322933X", "B004P7CMVE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AEBB86A", "078322933X", "B004P7CMVE", "B00HEPE6MM"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 48632}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.96, "brand": "WAHLBERG,MARK", "asin": "0767818024", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5102C0GE0TL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Big Hit"}
{"description": "If you want to hear \"nyuk-nyuk-nyuk\" in Spanish and Portuguese as well as in English, then the DVD format is for you.The Three Stooges: All the World's a Stoogegives a generous 124&nbsp;minutes of seven Curly classics in a random order: \"Grips, Grunts and Groans\" (1937), \"The World's a Stooge\" (1941), \"3&nbsp;Dumb Clucks\" (1937), \"Three Little Pirates\" (1946), \"Uncivil War Birds\" (1946), \"Back to the Woods\" (1937), and \"Violent Is the Word for Curly\" (1938). The shorts cover some familiar territory; \"Grips, Grunts and Groans\" is only the Stooges' 20th short in the Columbia series, and it is practically a rewrite of \"Punch Drunks,\" the second. Here Curly is driven wild by a perfume rather than a song and is put into a wrestling ring rather than a boxing ring. Even the backscreen projection of the crowd is the same one used in the earlier film.\"Three Little Pirates\" contains the famous \"Mahah, Ah&nbsp;Ha\" routine from their vaudeville days. \"Back to the Woods\" is one of their relatively rare costume efforts. The highlight of \"Violent Is the Word for Curly\" is a pleasant little vaudeville song about the alphabet. In \"Three Dumb Clucks,\" Curly gets to play a double role. The audio and video are generally good. The film of \"Three Little Pirates\" used for the transfer to DVD, however, shows a defect 10&nbsp;minutes into the episode in the form of vertical lines flickering to the left of the picture, which some might find distracting.--Frank Behrens", "related": {"also_bought": ["076782184X", "B0000VCZLQ", "B00005B1W8", "B00004U1ET", "B00151QYYE", "B00006ADCZ", "B001D7T6AO", "B00009ZPU4", "B00004XOO1", "B00006HAWM", "B00005O5BM", "B000SSQ7JW", "B00018D3QY", "B0009FU100", "B000H5TH1G", "B00005V5NT", "B000LP5CY8", "B0002A2WG8", "B001OXLGKA", "B001AXOFR0", "B00005M070", "B0002A2WFY", "B00007M5KN", "B000J3FBUW", "B004D8P258", "B002MJV786", "B0000DBJ29", "B003CPPY0Q", "B0000APVE7", "B001BSBBPI", "B0024396EM", "B00005JA8B"], "bought_together": ["076782184X", "B00004U1ET"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000LP5CY8", "B00004XOO1", "B00004U1ET", "076782184X"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 265483}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.81, "brand": "Columbia/Tristar Studios", "asin": "0767847571", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51K72J0Y38L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Three Stooges - All the World's a Stooge"}
{"description": "Unanimously hailed as one of the greatest masterpieces in the history of the motion picture,Seven Samuraihas inspired countless films modeled after its basic premise. But Akira Kurosawa's classic 1954 action drama has never been surpassed in terms of sheer power of emotion, kinetic energy, and dynamic character development. The story is set in the 1600s, when the residents of a small Japanese village are seeking protection against repeated attacks by a band of marauding thieves. Offering mere handfuls of rice as payment, they hire seven unemployed \"ronin\" (masterless samurai), including a boastful swordsman (Toshiro Mifune) who is actually a farmer's son desperately seeking glory and acceptance. The samurai get acquainted with but remain distant from the villagers, knowing that their assignment may prove to be fatal. The climactic battle with the raiding thieves remains one of the most breathtaking sequences ever filmed. It's poetry in hyperactive motion and one of Kurosawa's crowning cinematic achievements. This is not a film that can be well served by any synopsis; it must be seen to be appreciated (accept nothing less than its complete 203-minute version) and belongs on the short list of any definitive home-video library.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000K0YM0Y", "B001BEK8E2", "B000K0YLZ0", "B00005B1ZL", "B007N5YK10", "B002E01MBA", "B00K5EJHGO", "B00005JLEJ", "B00687XNNK", "B0009WIE2A", "B004XQO8MS", "B001WLMOL4", "B000059TFW", "B000AQKUD6", "B00180R072", "B00005JLMU", "B000067IY6", "B00005UQ7T", "B000E5LEV0", "B000ASATM6", "B000BR6QCI", "B0001UZZSG", "B00005QAPH", "6305081034", "B0007989YS", "B00065GX0K", "B006H3KQSK", "B001PCNZJU", "B00005JLV7", "B005JJCMN0", "B000WEH74G", "B00065GX64", "6305028699", "B00AEFYSEA", "B000V7HFL4", "0792841409", "0780021061", "B000AQKUH2", "B005HK13S6", "B0017MO0U6", "B00B2BYXSQ", "B001LMU1B4", "B0040QYROA", "B0050FXDDQ", "0783225903", "B0045HCJTO", "0780021045", "B0012SY0E6", "B000055Y0X", "B00EO2I6W4", "B001LMU1C8", "B00158K0RO", "B00004W3HF", "B000MM0LEG", "B004S801ZO", "B008VF0Y02", "0780020707", "B000XPSC0C", "B00003CXBU", "B000025RE7", "B00006ADD5", "0780022343", "0783226039", "B000056NWP", "B00005NC66", "6305257450", "B002ZG4Q5W", "B007Y1NR1W", "6304698798", "B000FDECGA", "B002IVDLH8", "B004M66YUS", "B00004Y7HL", "B002VRNJDA", "0767830555", "B0010YSD7W", "B004L9GMBC", "B001O549G6", "B003ZEQMH8", "B002VWNIAY", "B000VARC3C", "B003152Z4U", "B002U6DVPS", "B0000B1ODQ", "B00AEBB89C", "B008Y5OVZ8", "B0045HCJ9E", "B0087ZG7R0", "B005VU9LO0", "B0006GANN2", "B00AEFYL6K", "B00004TJKI", "B00DHN8FXG", "B0006GAOJA", "B003AWRMCE", "B000PKG6O4", "B00003CXR4", "B00HE01030", "B00ENNBZ68", "B006LLY8LY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005VU9LO0", "B001BEK8E2", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B00008RH1H"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 158968}, "asin": "0780020685", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51175A95QSL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Seven Samurai (Criterion Collection Spine #2)"}
{"description": "Welcome back one of the treasures of international cinema.  In 1929-30, when  Hollywood was stymied by the arrival of talkies, a Frenchman named Ren&eacute; Clair  set about reinventing the movies for the world of sound.  Rather than enslave  his camera--and imagination--to a microphone in a potted palm, Clair embraced  sound as a liberating new dimension of the motion picture.  His effervescent  comedy-musical-romanceLe Milliondoesn't just feature a witty commingling of  dialogue and song--it's ajeu d'espritin which every movement, every cut,  every sound effect (or absence thereof) contributes to a lilting rhythm.The plot is precisely as airy and as farcically complicated as it needs to  be.  Suffice it to say that there's this threadbare jacket with a winning  lottery ticket in the pocket.  It becomes separated from its starving-artist  owner and leads him and numerous others a merry chase over the roofs of  Paris, through the urban underworld, and onto the very stage of the Opera.  You'll wonder more than once whether the Marx Brothers were taking notes.For no good reason whatsoever,Le Millionremained out of  circulation for decades, except for a few bleary dupe  videos.  Now we have a crystal-clear DVD that does full justice to Lazare  Meerson's ethereal settings, Georges P&eacute;rinal's luminous camerawork, the  enchanting beauty of leading lady Annabella, and Ren&eacute; Clair's world-class  comedy masterpiece.

{"description": "Even if the notorious 1970s porn-filmmaking milieu doesn't exactly turn you on, don't let it turn you off to this movie's extraordinary virtues, either.Boogie Nightsis one of the key movies of the 1990s, and among the most ambitious and exuberantly alive American movies in years. It's also the breakthrough for an amazing new director, whose dazzling kaleidoscopic style here recalls the Robert Altman ofNashvilleand the Martin Scorsese ofGoodFellas. Although loosely based on the sleazy life and times of real-life porn legend John Holmes, at heart it's a classic Hollywood rise-and-fall fable: a naive, good-looking young busboy is discovered in a San Fernando Valley disco by a famous motion picture producer, becomes a hotshot movie star, lives the high life, and then loses everything when he gets too big for his britches, succumbs to insobriety, and is left behind by new times and new technology. Of course, it ain't exactlyA Star Is BornorSingin' in the Rain.  Writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson (in only his second feature!) puts his own affectionately sardonic twist on the old showbiz biopic formula: the ambitious upstart changes his name and achieves stardom in porno films as &quot;Dirk Diggler.&quot; Instead of drinking to excess, he snorts cocaine (the classic drug of '70s hedonism); and it's the coming of home video (rather than talkies) that helps to dash his big-screen dreams. As for the britches ... well, the controversial &quot;money shot&quot; explains everything.

{"description": "This dramatization of the tangled history of Apple Computer and Microsoft, based on a book by Paul Freiberger and Michael Swaine, hits enough of the right notes to make its failures all the more frustrating.  The script follows the entwined paths of Apple's Steve Jobs and Microsoft's Bill Gates with a pointed sense of the cultural divide between the hip, self-absorbed Apple cofounder and the brilliant alpha geek behind Microsoft's eventual software empire, contrasting the Mac's countercultural underpinnings with the PC's more strait-laced origins.  ButPirates of Silicon Valleyseemingly can't decide whether it wants to be a serious-minded history of these key figures in the personal computer revolution or a trashy wallow in the more ignoble foibles of its principals. As a result, it falls short of exacting history while never achieving the guilty pleasure it might have.If Gates has become synonymous with corporate conquest at its most striking,Pirates' interest lies more with Jobs, given a nervous energy and flashes of adolescent selfishness by Noah Wyle, who benefits from a reasonable physical resemblance to the Apple chief. Eyewear and a comb-over do nearly as well for Anthony Michael Hall, who also grafts some of Bill Gates's better-known mannerisms onto his performance and renders Gates as a smart if socially maladroit entrepreneur who, like Jobs, provides the ambition and business savvy to exploit his partner's computing talents. There are a few fanciful touches (Ballmer and Wozniak become Greek choruses, addressing the viewer as they comment on the principals), but the story plays out in straightforward fashion.  It's tantalizing to consider how the Apple/PC melodrama might have fared with an edgier, more openly satirical script.--Sam Sutherland", "related": {"also_viewed": ["0780631536", "6304119046"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 352208}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 13.99, "brand": "", "asin": "0780627717", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51R0NK28Q8L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Pirates of Silicon Valley [VHS]"}
{"description": "The plotline may sound familiar: Two mismatched cops are assigned as reluctant partners to solve a crime. Culturally they are complete opposites, and they quickly realize they can't stand each other. One (Jackie Chan) believes in doing things by the book. He is a man with integrity and nerves of steel. The other (Chris Tucker) is an amiable rebel who can't stand authority figures. He's a man who has to do everything on his own, much to the displeasure of his superior officer, who in turn thinks this cop is a loose cannon but tolerates him because he gets the job done. Directed by Brett Ratner,Rush Hourdoesn't break any new ground in terms of story, stunts, or direction. It rehashes just about every \"buddy\" movie ever made--in fact, it makes films such asTango and Cashseem utterly original and clever by comparison. So, why did this uninspired movie make over $120 million at the box office? Was the whole world suffering from temporary insanity? Hardly. The explanation for the success ofRush Houris quite simple: chemistry. The casting of veteran action maestro Jackie Chan with the charming and often hilarious Chris Tucker was a serendipitous stroke of genius. Fans of Jackie Chan may be slightly disappointed by the lack of action set pieces that emphasize his kung-fu craft. On the other hand, those who know the history of this seasoned Hong Kong actor will be able to appreciate thatRush Hourwas the mainstream breakthrough that Chan had deserved for years. Coupled with the charismatic scene-stealer Tucker, Chan gets to flex his comic muscles to great effect. From their first scenes together to the trademark Chan outtakes during the end credits, their ability to play off of one another is a joy to behold, and this mischievous interaction is what saves the film from slipping into the depths of pitiful mediocrity.--Jeremy Storey", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00003CY5X", "B000059XYJ", "B00005JL8Y", "6302091632", "B00006G8LB", "B00000JGEK", "6300213730"], "bought_together": ["B00003CY5X"], "also_viewed": ["B00003CY5X", "B00005JL8Y", "B000WGYMTC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 400219}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.0, "brand": "", "asin": "0780623711", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514DYRWFBKL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Rush Hour [VHS]"}
{"description": "Edward Norton was nominated for a 1998 Best Actor Oscar for his role as  Derek Vinyard, a thoughtful kid turned neo-Nazi after his father is slain.  Edward Furlong plays his younger brother, Danny, determined to follow in his brother's footsteps.  The easy routes the film seems prepared to take never materialize.  It continually makes Derek's transformation both in and out of his racist beliefs believable and persuasive.  Stacy Keach is given the head vampire role of the local skinhead chapter, Cameron, and he's the closest this film comes to an overt overstatement.  Norton, however, is fantastic, embodying a person who roller-coasters through hatred like he can't wait to ride again.  His diatribes are not unlike what can be heard on any given conservative radio station on any given day, but he doesn't spew them as cant or screed.  Only when his violent emotions take charge, negating any sense or stand, is the underlying fallacy and nature of his beliefs made plain. This film was undermined by the film's own director, Tony Kaye, who made such a braying ass of himself and his work that it distorted the public's view of what is an interesting social and psychological lesson in the war between ideas and ideologues, reason and racism.--Keith Simanton", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303686796", "B00004W5UA", "B00000J2L7"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 321982}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.59, "brand": "", "asin": "0780625129", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516KFV9DGKL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "American History X [VHS]"}

{"description": "Coasting on the successes ofGods and MonstersandGeorge of the Jungle, Brendan Fraser turns in yet another winning performance in this fish-out-of-water comedy in which Pleasantville meets modern-day Los Angeles, with predictably funny results. Fraser stars as Adam, who was born in the bomb shelter of his paranoid inventor dad (a less-manic-than-usual Christopher Walken), who spirited his pregnant wife (Sissy Spacek, in fine comic form) underground when he thought the Communists dropped the bomb (actually, it was a plane crash). Armed with enough supplies to last 35 years, the parents bring up Adam inLeave It to Beaverstyle with nary any exposure to the outside world. When the supplies run out, and dad suffers a heart attack, Fraser goes up to modern-day L.A. for some shopping and long-awaited culture shock. More of a cute premise with lots of clever ideas attached than a fully fleshed out story,Blast from the Pastis also supposed to be part romantic comedy, as the hunky Adam hooks up with his jaded Eve (Alicia Silverstone) and tries to convince her to marry him and go underground. The sparks don't fly, though, because Silverstone is saddled with the triple whammy of being miscast, playing an underwritten character, and suffering a very bad hairdo. Fraser, however, carries the film lightly and easily on his broad, goofy shoulders, mixing Adam's gee-whiz innocence with genuine emotion and curiosity; only Fraser could pull off Adam's first glimpse of a sunrise or the ocean with both humor and pathos. Also winning is Dave Foley as Silverstone's gay best friend, who manages to make the most innocuous statements sound like comic gems.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005RIJ3"], "bought_together": ["B00005RIJ3"], "also_viewed": ["B00G5G7EXY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 277212}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.95, "brand": "", "asin": "0780626478", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/513Y40DFZ6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Blast From the Past [VHS]"}

{"description": "Heavy-metal golf with Adam Sandler, a 1996 dry run of the wild-man-athlete formula that paid off so handsomely inThe Waterboy. There are some irresistibly funny sequences, although you may hate yourself for laughing at the mean-spirited slapstick. This isn't a classic golf comedy, like the Bill Murray vehicleCaddyshack, but as a hot-tempered would- be hockey player who finds an unexpected m&#xE9;tier as a power golfer, Sandler has a short-fuse shtick that's effectively deployed. He's like a punk rocker gleefully out of his element, puncturing the country-club atmosphere by using the fairway as a private mosh pit. The action gets repetitive beyond the midpoint, and a subplot involving Gilmore's lovable grandma and her problems with the IRS is dismayingly sappy. Sandler's iconoclasm is mostly window dressing; there's no conceptual or satirical daring in his kind of \"outrageousness.\" The strong supporting cast includes Christopher McDonald as Gilmore's smug rival on the links, Julie Bowen as a perky publicist, and, in a memorable bout of fisticuffs with our hero, game-show host Bob Barker. Director Dennis Dugan  (Problem Child) himself plays Doug Thompson, the golf-tour supervisor.--David Chute", "related": {"also_bought": ["0788816454", "6300989003"], "bought_together": ["0788816454"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 177944}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 0.49, "brand": "", "asin": "0783219105", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51G6A1H2BAL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Happy Gilmore [VHS]"}

It's the movie that macho maverick writer-director John Milius was born to make, and Arnold was genetically engineered for his role as the muscle-bound, angst-ridden hero created in Robert E. Howard's pulp novels. Oliver Stone contributed to Milius's screenplay, and the production design by comic artist Ron Cobb represents a perfect cinematic realization of Howard's fantasy world. To avenge the murder of his parents, Conan tracks down the evil Thulsa Doom (James Earl Jones) with the help of Queen Valeria (played by buff B-movie vixen Sandahl Bergman) and Subotai the Mongol (Gerry Lopez).

{"description": "A movie that only true horror buffs could love,Army of Darknessis officially part 3 in the wild and wacky Evil Dead trilogy masterminded by the perversely inventive director Sam Raimi, who would later serve as executive producer of the popular syndicated TV seriesHercules: The Legendary Journeys.Raimi's favorite actor, Bruce Campbell, returns as Ash (hero of the first two Evil Dead flicks), a hardware-store clerk who is magically transported--along with his beat-up Oldsmobile and a chainsaw attachment for his severed left forearm--to the brutal battlefields of the 14th century. He quickly assumes power (who else in the Middle Ages packs a shotgun and a chainsaw?), and unites his band of medieval knights against the dreaded Army of the Dead. Raimi gleefully subverts almost every horror-movie clich&eacute; as he serves up a nonstop parade of blood, gore, and vicious sword-bearing skeletons--an affectionate homage to animator Ray Harryhausen's classicJason and the Argonauts.

{"description": "Released in late 1999,The Bone Collectorwas originally promoted as a thriller in the tradition ofThe Silence of the LambsandSeven, suggesting that it would earn a place among those earlier, better films. Nice try, but no cigar.The Bone Collectorsettles instead for mere competence and the modest rewards of a well-handled formula. With a terrific cast at his service, director Phillip Noyce (Dead Calm,Patriot Games) turns the pulpy indulgence of Jeffery Deaver's novel into a slick potboiler that is grisly fun only if you don't pick it apart.Noyce expertly builds palpable tension around a series of gruesome murders that lead us into the darkest nooks of New York City. Now a bedridden quadriplegic prone to life-threatening seizures and suicidal depression, forensics detective Lincoln Rhyme (Denzel Washington) gets a new lease on life with a sharp young beat cop (Angelina Jolie) who's a wizard at analyzing crime scenes. She does field work while he deciphers clues from his high-tech Manhattan loft, and as they narrow the search their lives are increasingly endangered. As this formulaic plot grows moldy, Noyce resorts to narrative shortcuts, using perfunctory scenes to manipulate the viewer and taking morbid pleasure in his revelation of the murder scenes. And yet it all works, to a point, and the cast (including Queen Latifah and Luiz Guzm&aacute;n) is much better than the material. If you're looking for a few good thrills,The Bone Collectoris a pretty safe bet.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEFXT1S", "B00AEFYF2K", "B00096S49Y", "B00AP2DC94", "B00011CZRE", "B002NZK5RI", "B00005JMWP", "B00AEFXEGS", "B00005JPD0", "B002GHHHN8", "B002AT8K9W", "B00015YVDG", "B002NZK5UU", "B00029RT9E", "6304884400", "6304765258", "B002NZK5VO", "0792159659", "B00009WVSL", "B000244GCC", "B002O3Z4ZW", "0790732149", "B00DHD933W", "B000GFLKF8", "B0050MB4OO", "B000OT6V0K", "B00AEBBA2W", "B0000VJG72", "B000JYW5BE", "B002NZK5R8", "B002AS464Q", "0790736411", "B00005JKWX", "B000QUCRB4", "B00006HAWN", "B001GKJ2E8", "B000CEV3M8", "6304711891", "B003ASLJIQ", "0767810872", "B00BTYOYG2", "6305428115", "B002AT8KAG", "0790730979", "B002LMV7R0", "B002O3Z4WK", "B00005JN0W", "B00006G8JD", "B00026ZD04", "B00004Z4WR", "B0043X1FNQ", "B005LAIGRS", "B00AEFYGBA", "B00005JLKN", "B004EPYZP8", "0800141806", "B0006HBZXS", "B0006GANOQ", "B000055Y0Y", "B00AEFYUQQ", "B000069HZP", "B00AEBB8LA", "B00005ATZT", "B002ZG997C", "B00005JA9F", "B00BTYU3W6", "0767803434", "B0021L8V0M", "B000244GCW", "B000ENC5YW", "B000R4SMCW", "B001KRVLCI", "B0045HCJFS", "B000P0J0C4", "B00000G3PA", "0783225547", "B00441GYXI", "B00AEFY4CG", "6304806434", "B00009L1TA", "B002GIBVVG", "B00AEFXYJA", "B002ZG99TA", "B0002V7OI8", "B00003CXGV", "B0050UEVNM", "0743491564", "B0045HCJ8K", "B003LR5BD0", "B00125WAWS", "B00000IQC4", "B0001FR3IQ", "6305718954", "B004A8ZX28", "B000G2YCVA", "B00005V4XV", "B001B3LIOC", "B00004BZIY", "6305767866"], "bought_together": ["B00AEFXT1S", "B00096S49Y"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AEFXT1S", "B00096S49Y", "B00AP2DC94", "B00005JPD0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 15287}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.55, "brand": "Universal Studios", "asin": "0783240295", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51H5Y1NXVWL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Bone Collector"}
{"description": "After scoring a hit with the Eddie Murphy-Nick Nolte cop thriller48 Hours, director Walter Hill returned to the buddy formula with this half-ridiculous, half-invigorating action flick about humorless Russian cop Ivan Danko (Arnold Schwarzenegger). He follows a drug dealer from Moscow to Chicago, where he's matched up with city cop Art Ridzik (James Belushi), whose work ethic is considerably more relaxed. Most of the humor revolves around Danko's grumpy reaction to good ol' American capitalism, while Ridzik urges him to chill out.Red Heatis not bad as action comedies go, but only if you get into the absurd spirit of this predictable fare, in which the unlikely buddies get to wisecrack and act casually while mayhem erupts everywhere they go.

{"description": "Patterns exist everywhere: in nature, in science, in religion, in  business. Max Cohen (played hauntingly by Sean Gullette) is a mathematician searching for these patterns in everything. Yet, he's not the only one, and everyone from Wall Street investors, looking to break the market, to Hasidic Jews, searching for the 216-digit number that reveals the true name of God, are trying to get their hands on Max. This dark, low-budget film was shot in black and white by director Darren Aronofsky. With eerie music, voice-overs, and overt symbolism enhancing the somber mood, Aronofsky has created a disturbing look at the world. Max is deeply paranoid, holed up in his apartment with his computer Euclid, obsessively studying chaos theory.  Blinding headaches and hallucinogenic visions only feed his paranoia as he attempts to remain aloof from the world, venturing out only to meet his mentor, Sol Robeson (Mark Margolis), who for some mysterious reason feels Max should take a break from his research. This movie is complex--occasionallytoocomplex--but the psychological drama and the loose sci-fi elements make this a worthwhile, albeit consuming, watch.Piwon the Director's Award at the 1998 Sundance Film Festival.--Jenny Brown", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 496232}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.99, "brand": "", "asin": "0784011796", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51P5P0C06XL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Pi [VHS]"}
{"description": "Todd Haynes, ever unpredictable, follows up his experimental trilogyPoisonand his restrainedSafewith this flamboyant study in glam rock through the kaleidoscopic lens ofCitizen Kane. Christian Bale plays Arthur Stuart, a reporter sent to investigate the legend of rock legend and bisexual pop icon Brian Slade (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers as a not-so-thinly veiled David Bowie), who disappeared a decade ago after staging his own mock assassination. But Arthur is flooded with memories of his own adolescence as he interviews Slade's friends and business associates, peeling back the layer of makeup and spangles that was the model of rebellion for a generation of middle-class British kids and discovering a hollow center. Ewan McGregor almost steals the film as the punk pioneer Curt Wild (equal parts Iggy Pop and Kurt Cobain), the genuine article to Slade's calculated, coifed image of glitter stardom.  Haynes's film lacks nothing in capturing the flamboyance and spectacle of the era with flashy filmmaking and kitschy costumes, and if the plot seems lost in the preening and visual fireworks, perhaps that's the point: behind the fa&ccedil;ades and manufactured fronts is nothing but glitter, energy, and a beat.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00000DLV3", "B00005QW5X", "B005TTEFZ8", "B000FO0AD8", "B0002JZT5A", "B00004ZBVO", "B00005UW73", "B000EQHXNW", "B001KEHAEE", "B000RIWAVC", "076782153X", "B00C7T0EPS", "B000255LIY", "B00080ZHD2", "B000GIXLXE", "B0057ZAA6W", "B00BTYXNPK", "B005M2AKJW", "0767819772", "B0079K4WEE", "B00020VZTS", "0783241909", "B0050ODZ6M", "B0006FO8E8", "B007WZTMCI", "B002ZG97O2", "B0013D8L7C", "B000HRMAPE", "B00009MEKN", "B002ZG9800", "B004XNNUZ2", "B004A8ZWV0", "6305499144", "B008N25X7M", "B00GTZWVXE", "B00133KFGW", "B0000A1HQI", "0786883995", "B0013D8LC2", "B007CEFTSA", "B0000648YK", "B00HQVB0Q4", "B000E6ESL2", "B0042RJWTC", "B000MGB6NM", "B00IKM5NJS", "B00005JLQH", "6305428093", "B00005JLHW", "B000E6ESKS", "B00IA7MFEO", "B00005JM2Y", "B000CBCWIK", "B0016MJ6T2", "B000059PQB", "B004MRX8D8", "B0083V2VYG", "1892649462", "B00GHP8SH4", "B0036TGSR6", "B000065V3W", "B00023P4I8", "B0013D8LCW", "B0007Y08QA", "B000KX0IM2", "B00CC2V7AQ", "B004THJ3BC", "B00008YLUX", "B004SIP8WU", "B000089760", "B002DLB1I4", "B002VJVCN2", "B001CC7PLM", "B00E5PHTR8", "B0009A40ES", "B00FRILRW0", "B000F6II1M", "B000P12LWY", "B001QUF3SW", "B000PAAJZ6", "B00996RSYM", "B00FGG60XY", "B006OB3K56", "B00005V5NU", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B00F98FOPE", "B001FBSLPE", "B00GS08Y3Q", "B00CBFB8QC", "B00014NE62", "B008JFX04G", "B0002I84JO", "B004SEUJXM", "B001BMN35K", "B000EHRVOM", "B00005JKJA", "B000E5KURY", "B00BSN0VZW", "B00GSA3K6C"], "bought_together": ["B00005QW5X"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005QW5X", "B00000DLV3", "B000RIWAVC", "B00004ZBVO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 172306}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.39, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "0788815741", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51JW0WJSRRL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Velvet Goldmine"}

{"description": "Twisterwas a mega-million-dollar blockbuster--helmed by a director (Dutchman Jan de Bont) hot off another scorcher hit (Speed)--that flaunted state-of-the-art digital effects and featured a popular leading actress (Helen Hunt) who would win an Academy Award for her next film (As Good As It Gets). But ask anybody who's seen it and they'll tell you who the real star ofTwisteris: the cow. Not to give anything away, but the cow is one of those inspired little touches (like, say, Bronson Pinchot's career-making cameo inBeverly Hills Cop) that adds a touch of personality to a gigantic Hollywood production. The story is blown out the window after an impressive prologue in which Hunt's character, as a little girl, witnesses her daddy being sucked into a tornado. Basically, Hunt and Bill Paxton are thrill-seeking meteorologists chasing twisters in order to study them (and help warn people of them, of course) with a new technology they've developed. If you thought the Kansas tornado inThe Wizard of Ozwas every bit as scary as the Wicked Witch of the West, then this may be the movie for you.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783225547", "B00E8G5HQE", "B00008G8M4", "B0002V7OI8", "B00000G3PA", "B00005JMXX", "B000P0J0C4", "B0006GANOQ", "B002GIBVVG", "B00AEFXPSK", "6304806434", "B001OFM2TC", "B0045HCJFS", "B0057RCFQS", "0783225733", "B00AEFXT1S", "B000N4RAS8", "B000P0J09W", "6304711891", "B00004Z4WR", "B007STBUHI", "B007SPPANM", "B00E8G5HZ0", "B001OQCV2E", "B0013BM63O", "B00AEFXPMG", "B000QUCRB4", "6305236569", "B000EHSVPK", "B002GHHHKQ", "B000EGDB10", "B00026ZG10", "B000QUU4LY", "B00AEFY4CG", "0800195175", "B001LXIDW2", "0790732149", "1558908315", "B00177YA1K", "B0007PLLBU", "B00003CXFV", "B00081U7HC", "6305212112", "1603800875", "B000JYW5BE", "B0068FZ0O2", "0783235070", "B00003CXTG", "B000FO0AA6", "B000ETRA5U", "B00005JN5E", "B001LXIDVS", "B006VRRGNK", "B0068FZ0GK", "B0013FDM7E", "B00003CXSM", "B00004XPPG", "B000CEV3M8", "6304765266", "B001LXIDVI", "B000QUCQX8", "B000QQLVPQ", "B00393SG1U", "0790730979", "B00AEFXE9U", "B00AEFXXMI", "B000EHSVNW", "0767803434", "B004AOECXI", "B000GRUMPU", "B001ECDVK4", "630471193X", "B00008WFU4", "B005QW98NM", "B000P0J0EW", "B00AEBB8NS", "B000SFOW8I", "B00AEFYW64", "B002NZK5V4", "B00AEFY6PQ", "B00008G6E8", "B0045HCJT4", "0783223609", "B00000IQC4", "B00005ATZT", "B00008WFU5", "B00008K76U", "B00AEFY5TI", "B0006FYOTC", "B007IUEE0C", "B00AEFY0F2", "B0002CHK1S", "0783225504", "B001CRC4DG", "B00407PO3W", "B002XUBDRY", "B0000844I8", "0800177258", "B00005JNTI"], "bought_together": ["B00008G8M4", "B00000G3PA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00634MLO0", "B00008G8M4", "B005LAIIPS", "0783225733"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 91188}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 13.95, "brand": "", "asin": "0790729636", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GW5RZP9SL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Twister"}

{"description": "Only die-hard Bill Murray fans will likely consider this movie for their home-video library, but it's not without its rewards. You can see why someone as comically astute as Murray would agree to play a dimwitted American who can't tell the difference between improvised theater and a real-life espionage plot. There's certainly plenty of potential for belly laughs, and Murray milks the opportunities like the old pro that he is.  Here he plays an American tourist in London who thinks he's been recruited into a street-theater act called \"Theater of Life\"; actually, he's stepped into a complicated spy scheme that plays like a cross between Hitchcock and the Marx Brothers. Joanne Whalley costars as the femme fatale who may or may not be a double agent, and along the way there's enough comical confusion to foil any number of idiotic villains. The movie stretches its one-joke premise to desperate extremes (Murray thinks he's in a play, so he's oblivious to genuine danger), and 95 minutes is more than enough time to exhaust the comedic possibilities. But, as always, Murray finds a way to mine gold from a few clever bits, and he cuts loose with some inspired lunacy during a climactic scene involving a hidden bomb and a troupe of dancing Cossacks. It's not Murray's finest hour, but give him credit for making the best out of a challenging situation.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00004RJ73"]}, "price": 16.98, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 410814}, "asin": "079073477X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51PT57C6XHL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Man Who Knew Too Little [VHS]"}

{"description": "Saturday Night Feveris one of those movies that comes along and seems to change the cultural temperature in a flash. After the movie's release in 1977, disco ruled the dance floors, and a blow-dried member of a TV-sitcom ensemble became the hottest star in the country. For all that, the story is conventional: a 19-year-old Italian-American from Brooklyn, Tony Manero (John Travolta), works in a humble paint store and lives with his family. After dark, he becomes the polyester-clad stallion of the local nightclub; Tony's brother, a priest, observes that when Tony hits the dance floor, the crowd parts like the Red Sea before Moses. Director John Badham captures the electric connection between music and dance, and also the desperation that lies beneath Tony's ambitions to break out of his limited world. The soundtrack, which spawned a massively successful album, is dominated by the disco classics of the Bee Gees, including \"Staying Alive\" (Travolta's theme during the strutting opening) and \"Night Fever.\" The Oscar-nominated Travolta, plucked from the cast ofWelcome Back, Kotter, for his first starring role, is incandescent and unbelievably confident, and his dancing is terrific. Oh, and the white suit rules. (Note:Saturday Night Feverwas cut from its original R-rated version after its initial release in order to obtain a PG rating. The PG version is 11 minutes shorter and is missing parts of scenes and some street talk. Both versions are available on video.)--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300213668", "6300213978", "6304437250", "6300216993", "0790705141", "0783235607", "6302120101", "0792837614", "6300263673", "B00000JKNP", "6303182577", "6301977815", "6300214184", "6304508611", "630018403X", "6300271781", "0767825985", "0782008348"], "bought_together": ["6300213668"], "also_viewed": ["6300213668", "B000P6R6VK", "B00AMSLDUG", "B00APQLJOU", "6300213978"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 145081}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.98, "brand": "", "asin": "0792100085", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51N6CXGG6EL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Saturday Night Fever [VHS]"}

{"description": "\"When the legend becomes fact, print the legend.\" That's more than the code of a newspaperman inThe Man Who Shot Liberty Valance; it's practically the operating credo of director John Ford, the most honored of American filmmakers. In this late film from a long career, Ford looks at the civilizing of an Old West town, Shinbone, through the sad memories of settlers looking back. In the town's wide-open youth, two-fisted Westerner John Wayne and tenderfoot newcomer James Stewart clash over a woman (Vera Miles) but ultimately unite against the notorious outlaw Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin). Ford's nostalgia for the past is tempered by his stark approach, unusual for the visual poet ofStagecoachandThe Searchers. The two heavyweights, Wayne and Stewart, are good together, with Wayne the embodiment of rugged individualism and Stewart the idealistic prophet of the civilization that will eventually tame the Wild West. This may be the saddest Western ever made, closer to an elegy than an action movie, and as cleanly beautiful as its central symbol, the cactus rose.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300988473", "B0000TANUI", "6301798090", "6301802330", "0792110188", "B000051S3Z", "0792107683", "6300268470", "0792107128", "6300181715", "0782008348", "B000M7BEPQ", "6300267938", "630197705X", "0790741040", "6301797922", "6300267830", "6301736362", "6304457308", "0792105907", "0792102320", "6300183041", "0792108868", "6300268799", "1555265952", "078321541X", "B00004RFFA", "B001E419N8", "6300216012", "6300208281", "6300181588", "6303192254", "6301662962", "6302923042", "6300269884", "630442972X", "6304673019", "6300246965", "6304457316", "6300215733", "6303393985", "0790751216", "630150528X", "6301805518", "0792838556", "6304457278", "B0000022WA", "6301718275", "6304441630", "B00005RRG6", "079283853X", "B0000TANUS", "6300184951", "B000M5BRX2", "6303120474", "6303334598", "6302751136", "0790743159", "6303471730", "6303109918", "6300216209", "6301976924", "6301972163", "6301773586", "6302226899", "6300213676", "B00004WZR1", "6302360978", "6301978110", "6301797906"], "bought_together": ["B000M7BEPQ"], "also_viewed": ["6301802330", "6300267938"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 230138}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.92, "brand": "", "asin": "0792106989", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51AQQ4TCP1L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance [VHS]"}
{"description": "A stupendous historical saga,Braveheartwon five Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Director for star Mel Gibson. He plays William Wallace, a 13th-century Scottish commoner who unites the various clans against a cruel English King, Edward the Longshanks (Patrick McGoohan). The scenes of hand-to-hand combat are brutally violent, but they never glorify the bloodshed. There is such enormous scope to this story that it works on a smaller, more personal scale as well, essaying love and loss, patriotism and passion. Extremely moving, it reveals Gibson as a multitalented performer and remarkable director with an eye for detail and an understanding of human emotion. (His first directorial effort was 1993'sMan Without a Face.) The film is nearly three hours long and includes several plot tangents, yet is never dull.

{"description": "Mel Gibson's Oscar-winning 1995Braveheartis an impassioned epic about William Wallace, the 13th-century Scottish leader of a popular revolt against England's tyrannical Edward I (Patrick McGoohan). Gibson cannily plays Wallace as a man trying to stay out of history's way until events force his hand, an attribute that instantly resonates with several of the actor's best-known roles, especiallyMad Max. The subsequent camaraderie and courage Wallace shares in the field with fellow warriors is pure enough and inspiring enough to bring envy to a viewer, and even as things go wrong for Wallace in the second half, the film does not easily cave in to a somber tone. One of the most impressive elements is the originality with which Gibson films battle scenes, featuring hundreds of extras wielding medieval weapons. After Eisenstein'sAlexander Nevsky, Orson Welles'sChimes at Midnight, and even Kenneth Branagh'sHenry V, you might think there is little new that could be done in creating scenes of ancient combat; yet Gibson does it.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00004XPQ6", "B00003CXE6", "6303953425", "6304935811", "B0001VL30O", "B000054OW2", "6302415853", "0790741512", "6304071876", "6301792734", "6303168507", "6303942830", "0800125762", "6300183211", "B000007OY0", "B000056BRF", "6300214540", "B000065U6Q", "B00004WIDB", "B00003CXTF", "B00007KK15", "079070546X", "B0000A36J1", "B00000K3AN", "6302482712", "6300263673", "6305169187", "0788811355", "B00003BE3X", "0800116917", "6304414099", "6303020089", "0792133153", "0790744589", "6302909023", "0800132009", "079212569X", "6300185095", "6303313345", "0767819462", "6304259131", "B00000K2SC", "0800199421", "B0001DI5W6", "B00005JLTM", "630018224X", "0790701251", "6304151306", "6303696813", "0790731274", "0792147618", "B00005RIJ3", "6301586026", "6302945089", "0783223218", "6305718792"], "bought_together": ["B00004XPQ6", "B00003CXE6"], "also_viewed": ["0792151712", "6303314015", "6301966988", "6303402348", "B00004WIDB", "0792116887", "6300213668", "0800125762", "B00004XPQ6", "0792842111", "B00003CXTF", "0788812408", "6302526574", "6303215734", "0788806270", "6300183211", "B00004U8P4", "0788802194"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 521725}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 0.5, "brand": "", "asin": "0792139771", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51PF2QYK62L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Braveheart (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]"}

{"description": "When the theatrical release of James Cameron'sTitanicwas delayed from July to December of 1997, media pundits speculated that Cameron's $200&nbsp;million disaster epic would cause the director's downfall, signal the end of the blockbuster era, and sink Paramount Studios as quickly as the ill-fated luxury liner had sunk on that fateful night of April&nbsp;14, 1912. Some studio executives were confident, others horrified, but the clarity of hindsight turned Cameron into an Oscar-winning genius, a shrewd businessman, and one of the most successful directors in the history of motion pictures.Titanicwould surpass the $1&nbsp;billion mark in global box-office receipts (largely due to multiple viewings, the majority by teenage girls), win 11&nbsp;Academy Awards including best picture and director, produce the best-selling movie soundtrack of all time, and make a global superstar of Leonardo DiCaprio. A bona fide pop-cultural phenomenon, the film has all the ingredients of a blockbuster (romance, passion, luxury, grand scale, a snidely villain, and an epic, life-threatening crisis), but Cameron's alchemy of these ingredients proved more popular than anyone could have predicted. His stroke of genius was to combine absolute authenticity with a pair of fictional lovers whose tragic fate would draw viewers into the heart-wrenching reality of theTitanicdisaster. As starving artist Jack Dawson and soon-to-be-married socialite Rose DeWitt Bukater, DiCaprio and Kate Winslet won the hearts of viewers around the world, and their brief but never-forgotten love affair provides the humanity that Cameron needed to turnTitanicinto an emotional experience. Present-day framing scenes (featuring Gloria Stuart as the 101-year-old Rose) add additional resonance to the story, and although some viewers proved vehemently immune to Cameron's manipulations, few can deny the production's impressive achievements. Although some of the computer-generated visual effects look artificial, others--such as the sunset silhouette ofTitanicduring its first evening at sea, or the climactic splitting of the ship's sinking hull--are state-of-the-art marvels. In terms of sets and costumes alone, the film is never less than astounding. More than anything else, however, the film's overwhelming popularity speaks for itself.Titanicis an event film and a monument to Cameron's risk-taking audacity, blending the tragic irony of theTitanicdisaster with just enough narrative invention to give the historical event its fullest and most timeless dramatic impact.Titanicis an epic love story on par withGone with the Wind, and like that earlier box-office phenomenon, it's a film for the ages.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305123616", "6304117752", "6301792734", "6303215734", "B00000JS61", "6304178352", "6303396623", "6303314015", "B00003CXTF", "0769403468", "6301734734", "6302936381", "6303300480", "6305368139", "B00005RRG3", "6302610702", "0792839846", "6300207919", "B000P0J0C4", "6304546262", "B000056BRF", "6304400551", "6303101267", "630150528X", "6303637574", "B000P0J0EW", "6305126062", "6302935148", "0800199421", "6304681496", "0792116887", "6301963911", "B0000DCGT1", "B00001IVED", "6305169187", "B00006RCST", "6300216721", "630197879X", "0800113055", "076780922X", "080010367X", "0800141326", "0800184319", "6304039522", "B000066AXC"], "bought_together": ["6305123616"], "also_viewed": ["B009VQHDSQ", "6303314015", "B0074JODXU", "B00003CXTF", "B003JQZXWW", "6302787068", "6301796535", "0788812807", "0788806270", "B00005JKDQ", "6304500831", "6305229449", "6304117752", "6300213668", "6304089767", "B0000AQZYM", "079213690X", "6303049079", "6305123616", "6303402348", "6301792734", "0788812408", "B00079HZSE", "B000035Z2S", "B00000K3AN", "0788805843", "6302526574", "B0000029YC", "6303534422", "6303215734", "B0070285YE", "B00008LDO9", "0783216084", "6304434340", "B00BBND56G", "0788805533", "6300183211", "6302320402", "6305750750", "B0002CHI3S", "0790748266", "6304143184", "B0000040CM", "B005X7H9SQ", "B00004RFHF", "B00005V1Z7", "6302814782", "6301572688", "B00000JS61", "B008SLUWZG", "6303257844", "B00078XGO2", "0790736039", "B0000040EJ", "B000065U6Q", "B00003CX7L", "B00000ADKZ", "6300263673", "6302178924"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 65950}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.47, "brand": "Paramount", "asin": "0792151712", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21BAWEVBJ1L.jpg", "title": "Titanic [VHS]"}
{"description": "\"Something familiar, something peculiar, something for everyone: a comedy tonight!\" Those words from the opening song pretty much describe the menu inA Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum, a frantic adaptation of the stage musical by Larry Gelbart and Burt Shevelove. The wild story, set in ancient Rome, follows a slave named Pseudolus (Zero Mostel, snorting and gibbering) as he tries to extricate himself from an increasingly farcical situation; Mostel and a bevy of inspired clowns, including Phil Silvers, Jack Gilford, and Buster Keaton, keep the slapstick and the patter perking. The cast also includes the young Michael Crawford as a love-struck innocent. This project landed in the lap of Richard Lester, then one of the hottest directors in the world after his success with the Beatles' films. Lester telescoped the material through his own joke-a-second sensibility, and also ripped out some of the songs from Stephen Sondheim's Broadway score. The result is a pixilated romp and very close to the vaudeville spirit suggested by the title--though anyone with a low tolerance for Zero Mostel's overbearing buffoonery may be in trouble. Oddly enough, amidst all the frenzy, Lester creates a grungy, earthy Rome that seems closer to the real thing than countless respectable historical films on the subject.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B008SBXFUU", "B000BMY2LU", "B00001PE59", "B00003CWT3", "B000RPCK2E", "B0000068ZQ"], "bought_together": ["B008SBXFUU"], "also_viewed": ["B00402FGMG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 294428}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.74, "brand": "", "asin": "079283755X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51TGVS6F6HL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum [VHS]"}

{"description": "After the cultish success ofRepo Man, maverick director Alex Cox made the film that remains his masterpiece--a loud, brash, abrasive, painful, funny, and utterly brilliant screen biography of British punk rocker Sid Vicious and his American girlfriend Nancy Spungen. As played to perfection by Gary Oldman and Chloe Webb, Sid and Nancy are made for each other, serving their mutual strengths and weaknesses and rising with the punk-rock fame of Sid's group, the Sex Pistols, while falling into the ultimately lethal pit of drug abuse. Cox doesn't pull any punches or compromise the unsavory aspects of this passionate love story, so the film presents a harsh mix of emotional and physical anguish tempered by the very poignant and genuine love shared by its tormented central characters. Through it all, the film emerges as an intimate and yet oddly epic chronicle of punk's glory days of anarchic sex, drugs and rock & roll. It's as dynamic and confidently directed as any screen biography before or since, no less fascinating for its unpleasant aspects as for the touching emotions at its very human core.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000065RCD"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 434106}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.09, "brand": "", "asin": "0792839641", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Y5PCBCMSL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Sid &amp; Nancy [VHS]"}
{"description": "A stirring example of courage and the indomitable human spirit, for many John Sturges'sThe Great Escapeis both the definitive World War II drama and the nonpareil prison escape movie. Featuring an unequalled ensemble cast in a rivetingly authentic true-life scenario set to Elmer Bernstein's admirable music, this picture is both a template for subsequent action-adventure movies and one of the last glories of Golden Age Hollywood. Reunited with the director who made him a star inThe Magnificent Seven, Steve McQueen gives a career-defining performance as the laconic Hilts, the baseball-loving, motorbike-riding \"Cooler King.\" The rest of the all-male Anglo-American cast--Dickie Attenborough, Donald Pleasance, James Garner, Charles Bronson, David McCallum, James Coburn, and Gordon Jackson--make the most of their meaty roles (though you have to forgive Coburn his Australian accent). Closely based on Paul Brickhill's book, the various escape attempts, scrounging, forging, and ferreting activities are authentically realized thanks also to technical advisor Wally Flood, one of the original tunnel-digging POWs. Sturges orchestrates the climax with total conviction, giving us both high action and very poignant human drama. Without trivializing the grim reality,The Great Escapethrillingly celebrates the heroism of men who never gave up the fight.--Mark Walker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0007TKNM4", "B00004XPPC", "B0008ENHUI", "B00407PNY2", "B000MGTQ7U", "B000059TFW", "B000O78L00", "B000A2WJBQ", "B003PIUII8", "0792839730", "B003ASLJPE", "B000CNESN0", "B0007TKNGA", "B000EHSVS2", "B000EHSVSC", "B00005N5S3", "B00005PJ8S", "B003AWRMCO", "B0009HKH6Q", "B00BLA94IM", "B00AEFYPHA", "B0019UGYK0", "B00AEFY9YY", "B00AEFYBA6", "B00006ADD5", "B0008ENHTY", "B000ASDFHC", "B004R6JG7Q", "0792844017", "B0008ENHTO", "B00001ZWUS", "0790731460", "B00BL9NQ00", "B00AEFXD1O", "B00DDT0JB0", "B001PO556E", "B0049985XW", "B0045HCJ9E", "B00066FBQG", "B007N31YH0", "B000FZETR0", "B0006GANN2", "B00008DDGW", "B00096S4B2", "B0008ENHUS", "B00008PC0Y", "B002VWNIAY", "B003AWRMBA", "B0045HCJTO", "B000062XEX", "B00AEBBA0E", "B004ZRFQCG", "B000MGTQ7K", "B003ASLJRC", "B00CLH0848", "B00005N5S2", "B00441GYYC", "0783226853", "B000O599YO", "B0001AVZBW", "B003AWRMCE", "B004GSVXBW", "B000NTPG6Q", "0393325792", "B00AEFYTEY", "B000FFJYCU", "B0000CBY1C", "B001SV3LL0", "B00005QCVP", "B00079Z9VO", "B00005JN9P", "B00005JKF6", "B003ZEQMH8", "B00008AOTO", "B000O78L0U", "B001DDBD4K", "B000JJSJPK", "0783225733", "B000P0J0EW", "B009YX8MSG", "B0001NBMH6", "B0008ENHV2", "B0006419M8", "B002GHHHP6", "B003INBNOS", "B000CEXEWA", "B000BGR1B4", "B00005LC4D", "B007Y1NR1W", "B0050FXDDQ", "145164261X", "B000O599VC", "B00AEBB9UK", "B000EHSVOG", "B002O3Z4WU", "0767824555", "B004AOECXI", "B00AEBB9NM", "B00008AOTR", "B0013D8M4E"], "bought_together": ["B00004XPPC", "B0007TKNM4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00J4BW0SQ", "B00407PNY2", "B0007TKNM4", "B000059TFW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 1464}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.82, "brand": "Mgm/Ua Studios", "asin": "0792838408", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510N2J46JDL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Great Escape"}
{"description": "Harry Hook's adaptation is not as faithful to the William Golding novel as you'd wish (they excised theLord of the Fliesdialogue with Simon!) and because of it, the movie is less allegorical and less resonant. A group of young men from a military academy are stranded on an island. The group quickly becomes fractious with a passive section led by Ralph, trying to get rescued, and a hunter faction, led by Jack, trying to procure meat and \"have fun.\" Peter Brook's 1963 filming seemed to get closer to the Darwinist sense of this cultural disintegration. Here, the hunter faction seems more like Peter Pan's Lost Boys than the bloodthirsty murderers they are. The performances, particularly young Getty, don't quite carry the weight of the situation. It's still, however, sobering to slowly watch the school uniforms traded for war paint, and the little boys turn into little savages.--Keith Simanton", "related": {"also_viewed": ["6302891256", "B001BEK8EW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 338425}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 17.99, "brand": "", "asin": "0792840941", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51YZDPH135L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Lord of the Flies [VHS]"}
{"description": "Pierce Brosnan returns for his second stint as James Bond (afterGoldenEye), and he's doing it in high style with an invigorating cast of costars. It's only appropriate that a Bond film from 1997 would find Agent 007 pitted against a media mogul (Jonathan Pryce) who's going to start a global war (beginning with stolen nuclear missiles aimed at China) to create attention-grabbing headlines for his latest multimedia news channel. It's the information age run amok, and Bond must team up with a lovely and lethal agent from the Chinese External Security Force (played by Honk Kong action star Michelle Yeoh) to foil the madman's plot of global domination. Luckily for Bond, the villain's wife (Teri Hatcher) is one of his former lovers, and at the behest of his superior M (Judi Dench), 007 finds ample opportunity to exploit the connection. Although it bears some nagging similarities to many formulaic action films from the '90s,Tomorrow Never Dies(with a title song performed by Sheryl Crow) boasts enough grand-scale action and sufficiently intelligent plotting to suggest the Bond series has plenty of potential to survive into the next millennium. Armed with the usual array of gadgets (including a remote-controlled BMW), Brosnan settles into his role with acceptable flair, and the dynamic Yeoh provides a perfect balance to the sexism that once threatened to turn Bond into a politically incorrect anachronism.  He's still Bond, to be sure, but he's saving the world with a bit more sophisticated finesse.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6304032579", "B00008V2VP", "6305784906", "6304047843", "6302510031", "6302380294", "6302510023", "6302510198", "630251004X", "B000006FNX", "630251018X", "6302510015", "6302380596", "6302510007", "B00AQSN7HE", "B001PPLIEG", "6302380588", "B007REV4T8", "B00004TYS8", "6302824613", "6303651488", "6303651461", "630238060X", "B0000068SI", "B00000JGEI", "6303313345", "B000005QWI"], "bought_together": ["6305784906", "B00008V2VP"], "also_viewed": ["B009NUV0E8", "6304032579", "B001PO6FF4", "B00008V2VP", "B001AQO3TW", "B00AZFECS6", "630251004X", "B007REV4YI", "B001PPLIEG", "6302510007", "B009L6S5EC", "6304047843", "6305784906", "6302510198", "6303651488", "B00AQSN7HE", "630238060X", "B0055OG2BC", "B0030IIZ4M", "630251018X", "6302380294", "6303651461", "B00004TYS8", "6303402348", "B00K7IPGS6"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 584838}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.79, "brand": "", "asin": "079283965X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4149PM1DNVL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Tomorrow Never Dies (Limited Edition Gift Pack) [VHS]"}

{"description": "Based on Thomas Harris's novel, this terrifying film by Jonathan Demme really only contains a couple of genuinely shocking moments (one involving an autopsy, the other a prison break). The rest of the film is a splatter-free visual and psychological descent into the hell of madness, redeemed astonishingly by an unlikely connection between a monster and a haunted young woman. Anthony Hopkins is extraordinary as the cannibalistic psychiatrist Dr. Hannibal Lecter, virtually entombed in a subterranean prison for the criminally insane. At the behest of the FBI, agent-in-training Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) approaches Lecter, requesting his insights into the identity and methods of a serial killer named Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine). In exchange, Lecter demands the right to penetrate Starling's most painful memories, creating a bizarre but palpable intimacy that liberates them both under separate but equally horrific circumstances. Demme, a filmmaker with a uniquely populist vision (Melvin and Howard,Something Wild), also spent his early years making pulp for Roger Corman (Caged Heat), and he hasn't forgotten the significance of tone, atmosphere, and the unsettling nature of a crudely effective close-up. Much of the film, in fact, consists of actors staring straight into the camera (usually from Clarice's point of view), making every bridge between one set of eyes to another seem terribly dangerous.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005LKIM", "6302054982", "B00008AOS5", "B00005PJ8I", "B000007OY0", "6302800420", "0790705141", "B00003CXE6", "6301179552", "6301427076", "B000003KHS", "6300989003", "6303402348", "B0000633ZP", "B00005ATQA"], "bought_together": ["6302054982"], "also_viewed": ["6305363668", "6302415853", "0792116887", "079213690X", "0800103106", "6305750750"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 331980}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.0, "brand": "", "asin": "0792842111", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4117Q86BS0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Silence of the Lambs [VHS]"}

{"description": "FutureNightmarecreator andScreamweaver Wes Craven's  film debut is a primitive little production that rises above its cut-rate  production values and hazy, grainy patina via its grimly affecting portrait  of human evil infiltrating a middle-class household. The story is adapted  from Ingmar Bergman'sThe Virgin Spring, but the film has more in  common with Sam Peckinpah'sStraw Dogsas it charts the descent of a  harmless married couple into methodical killers. A quartet of criminals--a  distorted version of the nuclear family--kidnaps a pair of teenage girls and  proceeds to ravage, rape, torture, and finally brutally murder them in the  woods, unwittingly within walking distance of their rural home. The killers  take refuge in the girls' own home, but when the parents discover just who  they are and what they've done, they plot violent retribution.Along with George Romero'sNight of the Living Deadand Tobe Hooper'sTexas Chainsaw Massacre, Craven helped redefine American horror with  this debut--all three movies portray modern society crumbling into madness  and horror. But, unlike his fellow directors, Craven gives his film an  uncomfortable verisimilitude, setting it squarely in the heartland of modern  America. While at times it's awkward and inconsistent, with distracting comic  interludes, his handling of the brutal horror scenes is unsettling, and the  death of the daughter is an unexpectedly quiet and lyrical moment.--Sean  Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792839242", "6302921058", "B00000K0DU", "6300214311", "6300182770", "B00000IQUT"], "also_viewed": ["6302921058"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 475308}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.78, "brand": "", "asin": "079284632X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/512ZWA7XGZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Last House on the Left [VHS]"}
{"description": "Very few films come close to the brilliance Kenneth Branagh achieved with his first foray into screenwriting and direction.Henry Vqualifies as a masterpiece, the kind of film that comes along once in a decade. He eschews the theatricality of Laurence Olivier's stirring, fondly remembered 1945 adaptation to establish his own rules. Branagh plays it down and dirty, seeing the bard's play through revisionist eyes, framing it as an antiwar story. Branagh gives us harsh close-ups of muddied, bloody men, and close-ups of himself as Henry, his hardened mouth and willful eyes revealing much about this land war. Not that the director-star doesn't provide lighter moments. His scenes introducing the French Princess Katherine (Emma Thompson) are toothsome. Bubbly, funny, enhanced by lovely lighting and Thompson's pale beauty, these glimpses of a princess trying to learn English quickly from her maid are delightful.What may be the crowning glory of Branagh's adaptation comes when the dazed, shaky leader wanders through battlefields, not even sure who has won. As King Hal carries a dead boy  (Empire of the Sun's Christian Bale) over the hacked-up bodies of both the English and French, you realize it is the first time Branagh has opened up the scenes: a panorama of blood and mud and death. It is as strong a statement against warmongering as could ever be made.--Rochelle O'Gorman", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JLCI", "B0000714BZ", "0780021320", "B00B6OEEKQ", "0792844041", "B00CDV4JNS", "B001TR4G6W", "B000Q7ZNDG", "6305622876", "B004P29LDG", "B0007WRT4Q", "B00DQN6IOK", "B00000JL7T", "B000HWZ4AC", "B000002RRG", "B00019072G", "B0002TVWYW", "B00443FMKM", "B004M9ZI0M", "B000E6ESKS", "B00004Z4WW", "B001LPWGHS", "0769712231", "B00AMEZDPG", "B007RP4CAA", "B000063JZQ", "B00B2BYY1W", "B0059XTUR2", "B0002CHIVK", "B00005S872", "B003H0ZGWW", "B007RP4BZ6", "B0013D8LWC", "B0038RSJ0U", "B000QGE8IS", "B00J379KKW", "B008H6GHE2", "0822000296", "0198320337", "B000QGE8JC", "B00B1E6EAY", "0451526902", "0780021312", "B00BTYJYP8", "B000FILVO6", "B000777I88", "B004SIP83Y", "B000LPR6GA", "B0007LFPJ8", "1904271081", "B0000APNTV", "1411401034", "B00AJER4EM", "B005COLEOA", "0743484878", "B007H7OQW2", "0787970832", "B008D1A18E", "B00ECR7KX2", "B000056HEA", "B0012EM5CE", "B00019JRFY", "B00005YUO1", "B00B2BYY30", "B006JY3OHW", "B0000640TB", "B004SIP9U6", "B00063MC1Q", "0393927652", "B000002974", "B00AZFECHW", "B003Y5H5JM", "B007I1Q4YU", "1932219110", "B00A7OBIGO", "0140714790", "B007CJL17S", "0486428877", "B00007G1WH", "B00006G8HO", "B000BR6QIM", "B000RF7XYO", "B007I1Q50S", "B0002235QM", "B0038RSIGA", "B001VLBDB2", "0544442784", "B0068MNNOE", "B000BP86VE", "B003X82D1K", "B00K5EJHGO", "B00A1C17EK", "0439686806", "B0007CNXV4", "B0007WFUGK", "B0001UZZM2", "B0002Y4TII", "0743484916", "0838801366", "B000ALAT64"], "bought_together": ["B00005JLCI", "B0000714BZ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00DQN6IOK", "B0000714BZ", "B00005JLCI", "B003KSAYY6"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 15150}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 67.9, "brand": "MGM", "asin": "079284615X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51P0S2827PL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Henry V"}

{"description": "Considered by many to be the greatest B&nbsp;movie ever made, the original-release version of Orson Welles's film noir masterpieceTouch of Evilwas, ironically, never intended as a B&nbsp;movie at all--it merely suffered that fate after it was taken away from writer-director Welles, then reedited and released in 1958 as the second half of a double feature. Time and critical acclaim would eventually elevate the film to classic status (and Welles's original vision was meticulously followed for the film's 1998 restoration), but for four decades this original version stood as a testament to Welles's directorial genius. From its astonishing, miraculously choreographed opening shot (lasting over three minutes) to Marlene Dietrich's classic final line of dialogue, this sordid tale of murder and police corruption is like a valentine for the cinematic medium, with Welles as its love-struck suitor. As the corpulent cop who may be involved in a border-town murder, Welles faces opposition from a narcotics officer (Charlton Heston) whose wife (Janet Leigh) is abducted and held as the pawn in a struggle between Heston's quest for truth and Welles's control of carefully hidden secrets. The twisting plot is wildly entertaining (even though it's harder to follow in this original version), but even greater pleasure is found in the pulpy dialogue and the sheer exuberance of the dazzling directorial style.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302281849", "B001BZQMFA", "0783236352", "1558807780", "0783221347", "0782008348", "630266232X", "630347327X", "6305012792", "6302655897", "6302413400", "6302413435"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 403157}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.88, "brand": "", "asin": "1558804226", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51G3Y343C4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Touch of Evil [VHS]"}
{"description": "From a match made in heaven comes a movie spawned in hell! Young hotshot director Robert Rodriquez (El Mariachi,Desperado) teamed up withPulp Fictionauteur Quentin Tarantino (offering his services as writer and co-star) to make this outrageous, no-holds-barred hybrid of high-octane crime and gruesome horror. QT plays Richard Gecko, a borderline psychopath who breaks his career-criminal brother, Seth (George Clooney), out of prison, after which they rob a bank and leave a trail of dead and wounded in their bloody wake. Then they hijack a mobile home driven by a former Baptist minister (Harvey Keitel) who quit the church after his wife's death and hit the road with his two children (played by Juliette Lewis and Ernest Liu). Heading to Mexico with their hostages, the infamous Gecko brothers arrive at the Titty Twister bar to rendezvous for a money drop, but they don't realize that they've just entered the nocturnal lair of a bloodthirsty gang of vampires! With not-so-subtle aplomb, Rodriguez and Tarantino shift into high gear with a nonstop parade of gore, gunfire, and pointy-fanged mayhem featuring Salma Hayek as a snake-charming dancer whose bite is much worse than her bark. If you're a fan of Tarantino's lyrical dialogue and pop-cultural wit, you'll have fun with the road-movie half of this supernatural horror-comedy, but if your taste runs more to exploding heads and eyeballs, sloppy entrails and morphing monsters, the second half provides a connoisseur's feast of gross-out excess.Bon app&eacute;tit!--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002AF4Y9G", "B000UAE7O0", "B000R7HY0K", "B004U7MR14", "B000P0J0D8", "6305327041", "B0000A2ZU1", "B004SIP9Z6", "B004SIP95G", "B002T9H2LA", "B00008975Z", "B007D5E7C2", "B002ZG98C8", "B0000WN140", "B007D0FVRM", "B005LAIIJY", "6305428468", "B00005JMUA", "B0045DO81U", "B00005JMEW", "630569270X", "B0009A40ES", "B001VLBDD0", "B0000A2ZTY", "B003Y8YB3C", "B0031P77RU", "B00027JZ3E", "B00070FX5U", "B000ASDFI6", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00004Y87O", "B000A2UBN4", "B000OVLBHG", "B00005O5AY", "B00011CZRE", "B000K7VHNW", "B000093FLA", "B0024FADD8", "6305258287", "B000WC3864", "B003HKN52U", "B001CDFY50", "B000AXWHSA", "B00111YM5Q", "B000EHRVP6", "B002VWNIDG", "B000P0J09M", "0767811054", "B004P7CN7W", "B00005QJHP", "B00AEFYYWQ", "0767802519", "B00GDDNFDW", "0783229526", "B008CYDD7I", "B008LC8V1Y", "B0007DFJ0G", "B001KRVLCI", "B00005JKWJ", "B000RTB0R6", "0783229402", "B00AEFYUQQ", "B00003CXWV", "B00005JLRE", "B002U4UZSQ", "B000LP6KNU", "B00AKGG828", "B002WY65VU", "B005J9ZFQG", "6305594333", "B0007KZQAM", "B000C20VRS", "B000056PMU", "6304765258", "B00005N5S5", "B00006CXGP", "B003PIUINS", "6305065551", "B00005JA8B", "B0002ABURA", "B00001QGUM", "B003AWRMCE", "0800177789", "B000022TSY", "B003TRMLQM", "B00008RH3J", "B00AEFXESQ", "B0002KVULG", "B002GSXKNI", "B002JT69IW", "B0085A9HU6", "0780618548", "B000055Y0Y", "B004P7CMOQ", "B006CXIKYC", "0792846435", "B00AEBBADG", "B00AEFY5B6", "0767817664", "B00005V9HH"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004P7CMOQ", "B000UAE7O0", "B004SIP95G", "B004SIP9Z6"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 216353}, "asin": "1558908455", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/517ESWW8VSL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "From Dusk Till Dawn"}
{"description": "Like many other films by Canadian director David Cronenberg (especiallyCrash),Dead Ringerspresents the cinematic and psychological equivalent of an automobile accident--you dare not look, but you can't turn away. The film marked a directorial breakthrough for Cronenberg, who was able to continue some of the themes explored in his earlier horror films while graduating to a higher, more critically \"respectable\" level of artistic sophistication. The film is loosely based, amazingly enough, on a true story about twin gynecologists who routinely traded each others' identities, lives and even lovers. Utilizing innovative split-screen technology (years before computer manipulation made such trickery much easier), the film stars Jeremy Irons in flawless dual roles as the identical brothers Beverly and Elliot Mantle. Their ability to instantly switch identities leads them to a shared relationship with a well-known actress (Genevieve Bujold) and, ultimately, a physical and psychological tailspin that sends them both to the brink of madness and death. The scenario suggests that both men are halves of a whole, and that one cannot exist without the other. But when Beverly pursues a kinky, drug-addicted affair with the actress, his more self-controlled brother is helpless to prevent their mutual decline. In this wayDead Ringersbecomes a fascinating and stylistically clinical study of duality, and Cronenberg doesn't shy away from the dark and unpleasant aspects of the story. (One look at the movie's display of bizarre gynecological instruments and you'll know why women find this film particularly--and unforgettably--disturbing.)--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00JQYV0B4", "B0001XAKUQ", "B00009PY2T", "B00000F4MA", "B004SUDQ72", "0783228457", "B0000CDUT5", "B00AEFXR8I", "B005ZVIPG0", "B000056BP3", "B0009X768W", "B00LEW3L5Y", "B004ALIG4W", "B004ALIG1U", "B00009V7RV", "0780022629", "B00005B1ZK", "B00L3ZB7JO", "B00004ZBVO", "B003KGBIRK", "B00004W3HG", "B000CBG5PG", "B0002KPHZG", "B0007WFYC0", "B00B2BYXSG", "B0046ZYEVG", "B0001NBLX6", "B00005JKPT", "B00004Z1FM", "B004ALIG4M", "B000HT3QBE", "B001152TL6", "B00005QAPJ", "1559408677", "B00005EBSB", "B00KE3B6LU", "B000MNOXZ8", "B00GBT62PQ", "B000S0GYRU", "B0011U3OA6", "0780020707", "B00JVQ7QTM", "B000S0GYRK", "B001WLMOOG", "B00366F2NU", "B000A59Q4G", "B009ERK35W", "B00HT2RTU6", "B00KE3B6LA", "B00005NFZC", "B0001ZIYDO", "B00000IOKV", "B000069I09", "B001FOK70S", "B004ALIG0G", "078062856X", "B00K0MM4AM", "B004KDYR20", "B006PTL1QM", "B00005K9O8", "B000QXDFRQ", "B00KE3B6NI", "B00FF9SKQW", "B0007GAG42", "B0019X400I", "B001D8W7F4", "B000QQFKYE", "B003ELKNO0", "B009T3AE1Y", "B00GOT15IM", "B000BC8SWE", "B00005KH30", "B000127IF2", "B001JNNE1O", "B00004W457", "B00HE011DE", "B00JV054A6", "B000YENUI6", "B0000BUZKP", "B00BSN0VZ2", "B0000AINJ8", "B000ZM1MIM", "B00GPPXNLC", "B00005N7Z1", "B008CYDD7I", "B000I8OMEY", "B00HVOFP6W", "B00000IC7G", "B00IO9J5XW", "6305922756", "B000F3UA8E", "B001TK80CU", "0780023277", "0780022076", "B007N5YJMA", "B0053TWW9K", "B008220DGE", "B00125WATQ", "B001EIOOWC", "B00B2BYXTK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0783228457", "B00005K3NY", "B0000CDUT5", "B0009X768W"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 177136}, "asin": "1559408871", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4178D115ZEL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Dead Ringers (The Criterion Collection)"}

The newly mastered Dolby Digital 5.1 track is a phenomenal improvement, noticeably enhancing ambient sounds, dialogue, and Peter Gabriel's moving soundtrack. There are various added extras that really put the f'lm&#x92;s content into perspective.  The stellar commentary track includes director Martin Scorsese, star Willem Dafoe, screenwriter Paul Schrader, and film critic Jay Cocks candidly discussing various aspects of the production, including the initial obstacles, extensive research, and notorious controversial elements.

{"description": "Fran&ccedil;ois Truffaut's third feature, though it's named for the two  best friends who become virtually inseparable in pre-World War&nbsp;I Paris, is  centered on Jeanne Moreau's Catherine, the most mysterious, enigmatic woman in his career-long gallery of rich female portraits. Adapted from the novel by Henri-Pierre Roch&eacute;, Truffaut's picture explores the 30-year friendship between Austrian biologist Jules (Oskar Werner) and Parisian writer Jim (Henri Serre) and the love triangle formed when the alluring Catherine makes the duo a trio. Spontaneous and lively, a woman of intense but dynamic emotions, she becomes the axle on which their friendship turns as Jules woos her and they marry, only to find that no one man can hold her. Directed in bursts of concentrated scenes interspersed with montage sequences and pulled together by the commentary of an omniscient narrator, Truffaut layers his tragic drama with a wealth of detail. He draws on his bag of New Wave tricks for the carefree days of youth--zooms, flash cuts, freeze frames--that disappear as the marriage disintegrates during the gloom of the postwar years. Werner is excellent as Jules, a vibrant young man whose slow, melancholy slide into emotional compromise is charted in his increasingly sad eyes and resigned face, while Serre plays Jim as more of an enigma, guarded and introspective. But both are eclipsed in the glare of Moreau's radiant Catherine: impulsive, demanding, sensual, passionate, destructive, and ultimately unknowable. A masterpiece of the French New Wave and one of Truffaut's most confident and accomplished films.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["1572524448"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 485144}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.97, "brand": "", "asin": "1572525851", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51NEMNZZ25L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Jules and Jim [VHS]"}

{"description": "When New York theatrical producer Joseph Papp decided to bring  Gilbert and Sullivan to Broadway, he added typically broad, bold strokes to make  their singular operetta format meaningful to 1980s audiences.  InThe  Pirates of Penzance, Papp had a story that offered a mixture of potential action and comedy that was less arcane than other G&S; chestnuts, which Papp's production underlined by playing up its antic conflict between  its hapless, titular pirates and the citizens of Penzance, the Cornish town targeted for plunder.  Adding to the new production's mainstream allure  was the theatrical debut for erstwhile country-rock siren Linda Ronstadt as  the virginal Mabel, along with a plum role for another putative pop  heartthrob, Rex Smith, as the \"good\" pirate, Frederic.Naturally, such amendments piqued complaints from self-appointed G&S; purists, for whom the duo's original satirical edge and theatrical innovation were obscured (if not ossified) by their canon's patina of respectability.  Happily, for the rest of us, Papp's cheeky revisions  are generally on the money, and this 1983 film version preserves them with unusual fidelity.  Instead of opening up his production with location shooting or intricate editing, director Wilford Leach savors the  artifice of its stage sets and hokey, colorful costuming, celebrating the  genre's proud theatrical legacy.The cast, meanwhile, tears into the farcical plot with elan, led by  Kevin Kline as the Pirate King, a role perfect for his skill at lampooning masculine bravado (not to mention his underexposed, generally strong singing).  Broadway veteran George Rose proves the very model of the  modern Major-General Stanley, and Angela Lansbury, added to the film's cast  for marquee value, again shows her mettle as the ditzy maid, Ruth. Ronstadt justifies Papp's gamble, having trained rigorously to meet Sullivan's acrobatic melodies--indeed, this project marked her commitment to grow beyond rock, confirmed with her subsequent  exploration of classic pop with arranger-conductor Nelson Riddle.--Sam Sutherland", "related": {"bought_together": ["B002M2Z3BA"], "also_viewed": ["B00006RCMW", "B000G1ALGQ", "B0029WLJFC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 272675}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.79, "brand": "", "asin": "6300182762", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZBRARF91L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Pirates of Penzance [VHS]"}
{"description": "John Huston was eager for a lightweight lark, andThe List of Adrian Messengerwas just the project he needed. Philip MacDonald's upper-crust British murder mystery allowed Huston to work close to his Irish estate, including fox hunting and quail shooting well suited to Huston's lord-of-the-manor lifestyle. The mystery itself is clever enough: As a former MI-5 agent, George C. Scott is lured into the case when writer Adrian Messenger (John Merivale) gives him a list of 11 names to investigate, just before Messenger is mysteriously killed. Scott combs for clues to connect the names, and the film's promotional gimmick--big-name stars disguised under Bud Westmore's expert makeup--kicks into gear. Thus you get Burt Lancaster, Robert Mitchum, Tony Curtis, Kirk Douglas, and Frank Sinatra,barelyidentifiable under layers of latex, and the mystery never suffers from this playful distraction. Huston enjoyed making this film (he makes a cameo appearance, and his son Tony plays a supporting role), and that pleasure is passed along to the viewer.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000003NDA", "0792845404", "0792838009", "6301395395", "6304052952", "6301327853", "6300183998", "6304452829", "6302989787"], "also_viewed": ["B00007JZWI"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 246961}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 23.88, "brand": "", "asin": "6300184013", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51M01R873DL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The List of Adrian Messenger [VHS]"}

{"description": "Jingoism, beefcake, military hardware, and a Giorgio Moroder rock score reign supreme over taste and logic in this Tony Scott film about a maverick trainee pilot (Tom Cruise) who can't follow the rules at a Navy aviation training facility.

{"description": "When Samuel (Lukas Haas), a young Amish boy traveling with his mother Rachel (Kelly McGillis), witnesses the murder of a police officer in a public restroom, he and his mother become the temporary wards of John Book (Harrison Ford), a detective who's been assigned to solve the crime. After suspect lineups and mug-shot books yield nothing, Samuel, in the most memorable scene of the film, recognizes the murderer as a narcotics agent whose picture he sees in the precinct. Once Book realizes that the police chief is in on it, too, he whisks Samuel and Rachel back home to Amish country, where he himself goes into hiding as a plain Amish man. The juxtaposition between the life of the Amish and the violence of inner-city police corruption work surprisingly well for the story, and Kelly McGillis as the falling in love widow gives an almost perfect performance. Directed by Peter Weir, the film is extremely successful in drawing the viewer into its world and, accordingly, is immensely entertaining. The only thing that mars its polish is the one-dimensional, almost cartoonish handling of the upper-echelon police corruption--a subtler, more realistic treatment of this aspect of the story would have rendered the film near perfect.--James McGrath", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792116887", "B000007OY0", "6304259131", "0800125762", "6302816629", "6302238331", "6302935148", "0792133153", "6303269834", "B00000JS61", "080018789X", "630442972X", "B000003KDG", "0790743213", "6302415853", "6304071876", "079284517X", "B00005PJ8I", "6303402348", "0790748169", "6303057225", "6303637574", "6301599896", "6303942830", "B0000068ZQ", "6303020089", "6300181340", "0783235607", "6303402070", "B00007E2F6", "0790734079", "6300182479", "B00000J2L7", "6301734734", "079212569X", "6301736362", "6302909023", "0800116917", "6305126062", "6302226899", "6303696813", "6300247112", "0783226152", "B00000F5PI", "6305426678", "B000006N70", "0800132009", "6303058981", "6305012792", "B003MG6FJY", "6301976924", "5559477621", "B00005A1VH", "0783231482", "6303451462", "B000063UUP", "0792107683", "0800123506", "6304458975", "6303109950", "0790733935", "6304214502", "0792838556"], "bought_together": ["0792116887", "6302816629"], "also_viewed": ["6302380588"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 257292}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6300214567", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41JAT9P45FL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Witness [VHS]"}

Robert De Niro plays Vito as a young Sicilian immigrant in turn-of-the-century New York City's Little Italy. Coppola weaves in and out of the story of Vito's transformation into a powerful crime figure, contrasting that evolution against efforts by son Michael Corleone to spread the family's business into pre-Castro Cuba. As memorable as the first film is,The Godfather IIis an amazingly intricate, symmetrical tragedy that touches upon several chapters of 20th-century history and makes a strong case that our destinies are written long before we're born. This was De Niro's first introduction to a lot of filmgoers, and he makes an enormous impression.

{"description": "Clint Eastwood fired the original director, Philip Kaufman  (The Right Stuff), and took over the reins of this project himself. He may have had a point: this brutal, thoughtful western, a near-tragedy about a Civil War veteran whose past comes looking for him, is probably Eastwood's most mature frontier drama prior to the Oscar winningUnforgiven. Hoping to build a quiet life in a cooperative community of settlers, Eastwood's Wales blames himself when his enemies attack the homestead, and he has to revert to his warrior instincts to help fend off the threat. The jittery intensity of Sondra Locke (who would be Mrs. Eastwood, at least for a while), and the screen-filling charisma of the late Chief Dan George harmonize beautifully with Eastwood, who had finally figured out how to add depth and texture to his stock-in-trade Man of Steel persona. This one may be too short on action to satisfy fans of Eastwood'sDirty Harryfilms, or of the Italian westerns he made with Sergio Leone, but it's an honorable effort.--David Chute", "related": {"also_bought": ["0790751216", "6300182452", "0790751305", "6304429711", "0792836510", "0790731975", "0792837312", "6300182533", "6304457324", "630442972X", "6300183041", "6300268799", "6303020089", "0790734079", "630281622X", "B000005PJ3", "6301802330", "0792110188", "6302415853", "6302130379", "6300268470", "B000005PJ6", "0800125762", "079284100X", "6301971426", "B000007OY0", "6304437315", "B000GX4476", "6303192254", "6301796535", "B00005B238", "6301798090", "6300269884", "630150528X", "B00004RFFA", "6300247376", "6301966317", "6301797922", "630018224X", "6300248089", "B00004WIDB", "630197719X", "6304258984", "B000005PFL", "6301971809", "B000M5BRX2", "B000003KDG", "6301325508", "B000007PI4", "0792107128", "6304071876", "6300181154", "079212569X", "6300181588", "0783226152", "B00003CXFU", "6300214222", "6300216721"], "bought_together": ["6300182452", "0790751216"], "also_viewed": ["B003AWRMCE", "0792836510"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 284464}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 0.99, "brand": "Warner Bros.", "asin": "6300269043", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51NA6ZWN71L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Outlaw Josey Wales [VHS]"}

Streisand stars as Margaret, a  stay-at-home mom in the middle of New York who's feeling the strain of her narrow life.  Frustrated by her self-involved husband and the emotionally rewarding but  mentally unstimulating tasks of motherhood, she escapes into fantasies--such as  being hit on by a cross-gendered Fidel Castro, bombing the Statue of Liberty  with black militants, and having a furious catfight with her overbearing mother.  The movie's strength lies in these fantasies' slippery nature; some are over the  top, but others are so subtle you're not always sure where they start and stop,  making the portrait of Margaret's psyche intriguingly complex.

{"description": "This gorgeous adaptation of Lucy Maud Montgomery's classicchildren's storyis well worth watching with the whole family. Produced for Canadian television, it's one of those rare productions that actually sticks to the book and even enhances it through first-rate performances and an excellent script. Set on bucolic Prince Edward Island in the late 19th century,Anne of Green Gablesis the story of Anne Shirley, an imaginative and headstrong  orphan. When brother and sister Marilla and Mathew Cuthbert decide to adopt an orphan boy to help Matthew work the farm, they are astonished when Anne arrives at the train station by mistake. \"What use is she to us?\" grumbles the gruff Marilla.  \"We might be of some use to her,\" answers Matthew, who has taken an instant liking to the talkative Anne.  As Anne grows up, her adventures are both hilarious and moving. It's a delight to watch as she forms a friendship with the beautiful Diana and her admirer--the dashing Gilbert Blythe--then dyes her hair green, cracks a slate over Gilbert's head when he calls her \"Carrots,\" and finds a sympathetic teacher who encourages her to attend college.Richard Farnsworth is perfect as the shy and gentle bachelor Matthew, who confides to Anne that he never went courting because \"I would have had to say something.\" Colleen Dewhurst delivers a nuanced and powerful performance as Marilla, a seemingly cold-hearted spinster whose no-nonsense exterior conceals a warm heart. And as Anne, Megan Follows strikes the perfect note, maturing from freckle-faced orphan to elegant and poised young woman.--Elisabeth Keating", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301539354", "B00005O0ST", "1558906509", "B00005Y7AM", "6304117752", "B00005Y7AN", "0788812408", "6304400551", "078881172X", "6305123616", "B00005RRG5", "0788812807", "6305940932", "B003JLL2RW", "B000LC4ZBC", "B00007JMF2", "6301465598", "630339860X", "B00000F3QZ"], "bought_together": ["6301539354", "B00005O0ST"], "also_viewed": ["B0007NMHNS", "B00005Y7AN", "6301539354", "B00005O0ST", "B006ZUMNGS", "B00005Y7AM", "B001123BDY", "0553609416", "B001TD73OI", "B00020A1MU", "1558906428", "6300213668", "055321313X", "6303314015", "B000FSLMFO", "B008LG0GJA", "6304117752", "6301792734", "630339860X", "B00AEFXMGU", "0553213148", "0486283666", "6304401132", "1558906509", "B000085EF8", "0788812408", "B0000AQZYM", "6305212112", "6305613532", "B00007JMF3", "6304274742", "6304400551", "6304143184"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 50532}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.95, "brand": "Walt Disney Home Video", "asin": "6300277089", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51CM9X9GV2L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Anne of Green Gables [VHS]"}

It's one of the most unusual black comedies ever made, simply because it stretches a simple premise over 130 minutes of straight-faced, strangely compelling commentary on politics, media, and celebrity in media-savvy America. Adapted by Jerzy Kozinsky from his own novel, the movie's about a simple-minded, middle-aged gardener who, after a lifetime of seclusion and safety in a Washington, D.C. townhouse, gets his first exposure to reality beyond the walls of his sheltered existence. His only reference to the world is through his childlike addiction to television, and when a chance encounter brings him into the inner fold of a dying billionaire (Melvyn Douglas), he suddenly finds himself the toast of Washington's political elite. His simple phrases about gardening are misinterpreted as anything from economic predictions to sage political advice, and under the sharp direction of Hal Ashby, Sellers has the audacity to take this comedic conceit to its logical extreme.Being Thereis not for all tastes--especially not for those who don't appreciate comedic subtlety.

{"description": "Sergei Eisenstein's revolutionary sophomore feature has so long stood as a textbook example of montage editing that many have forgotten what an invigoratingly cinematic experience he created. A 20th-anniversary tribute to the 1905 revolution, Eisenstein portrays the revolt in microcosm with a dramatization of the real-life mutiny aboard the battleshipPotemkin. The story tells a familiar party-line message of the oppressed working class (in this case the enlisted sailors) banding together to overthrow their oppressors (the ship's officers), led by proto-revolutionary Vakulinchuk. When he dies in the shipboard struggle the crew lays his body to rest on the pier, a moody, moving scene where the citizens of Odessa slowly emerge from the fog to pay their respects. As the crowd grows Eisenstein turns the tenor from mourning a fallen comrade to celebrating the collective achievement. The government responds by sending soldiers and ships to deal with the mutinous crew and the supportive townspeople, which climaxes in the justly famous (and often imitated and parodied) Odessa Steps massacre. Eisenstein edits carefully orchestrated motions within the frame to create broad swaths of movement, shots of varying length to build the rhythm, close-ups for perspective and shock effect, and symbolic imagery for commentary, all to create one of the most cinematically exciting sequences in film history. Eisenstein's film is Marxist propaganda to be sure, but the power of this masterpiece lies not in its preaching but its poetry.--Sean Axmaker", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 523393}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6301815807", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21JVPR6MGVL.jpg", "title": "Battleship Potemkin [VHS]"}

{"description": "Director Bob Clark's charming, touching, and very funny adaptation of humorist Jean Shepherd's nostalgic, autobiographical Yuletide novel,In God We Trust, All Others Pay Cash, remains essential holiday family viewing. Narrated by a man (Shepherd) recalling his childhood, the film looks back at the compulsive efforts of 7-year-old Ralphie (Peter Billingsley) as he tries every means possible to acquire his dream Christmas gift--a Daisy-brand Red Ryder repeating BB carbine with a compass mounted in the stock. Problem is, he lives in a Norman Rockwell-esque Midwestern town in the 1940s, where his parents, teachers, and even Santa Claus all warn Ralphie that \"he'll shoot his eye out.\" Episodic in nature and seen entirely through the eyes of a child, the film offers a wonderful look at the day-to-day eccentricities that grew out of this conservative period. More interestingly, it cleverly captures childhood urgency, where even the most trivial fantasies or objects become immediate life-or-death necessities. While countless family Christmas movies serve up clich&eacute;d situations suffocating with preachy sermons, Clark's acute eye for detail and odd mixture of warmth, satire, and quirky humor are the reasons why so many viewers have rediscovered this after it initially bombed in the theaters. Sentimental without being syrupy, it's a true rarity: a holiday movie that adults and children can enjoy equally, for completely different reasons and regardless of the season.--Dave McCoy", "related": {"also_bought": ["079070546X", "6301969707", "6303215734", "B00005LOUS", "6302091632", "B001E4TDR2", "B00000JS61", "5559477621", "6304209266", "B0002F6BQU", "6304117752", "6304400551", "6303442447", "6302526574", "6304089767", "6302794331", "6301390725", "6305123616", "0788812807", "6302765536", "6303314015", "B00005LL26", "0307142450", "6301404440", "6300215695", "6303122647", "B000YABV7W", "0793941520", "0783215517", "6302503795", "B00004UGAU", "B000003KLW", "0375810331", "B00004VVP8", "6301912810", "6301578805", "B00004RFHF", "6301300394", "6302090873", "B0000D14JV", "6300157601", "B00000JGEK", "B00008X5J8", "6301928458", "B00000JKNL", "6301627768", "0800139151", "B00001IVED", "B00001YX9H", "6304140738", "6301798503", "6303675212", "6300989003", "B00005A1VG", "6302581907", "0767825985", "6300216993", "6301670140", "6301977742"], "bought_together": ["079070546X"], "also_viewed": ["6301969707", "B00001IVED", "B00005LOUS", "6303215734", "B00006HBUC", "6304117752", "6302914469", "6304500831", "6303212379", "6304400225", "6300274268", "6302787068", "155890641X", "B00000JS61", "6302178924", "6304434340", "B00004VVP8", "6304089767", "6302642248", "B0007KTBIU", "B00005LL26", "0788812408", "6304400551", "B0000AQZYM", "6303314015", "6302961572", "B00005JKDQ", "6304718551", "B0002F6BQU", "0783231482", "0792839846", "B000028U3S", "B00006FDMY", "6303123244", "B00003CX7L", "6305123616", "B00003CX8I", "6302320402", "0790719029", "6300213668", "6304143184", "1560395966", "B00005O5ML", "6302503795", "B00000K4ZI", "0788805843", "0790742578", "6303212395", "1560395737", "6303338690", "6302091632", "6304290888", "0790700506", "0790742322", "B00000490M", "B00004TX1W", "6304539274", "B00004RFHF", "6304151306"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 318159}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6301966554", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/512TVV2E0DL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "A Christmas Story [VHS]"}

{"description": "In the entire history of American movies,The Night of the Hunterstands out as the rarest and most exotic of specimens. It is, to say the least, a masterpiece--and not just because it was the only movie directed by flamboyant actor Charles Laughton or the only produced solo screenplay by the legendary critic James Agee (who also cowroteThe African Queen). The truth is, nobody has ever made anything approaching its phantasmagoric, overheated style in which German expressionism, religious hysteria, fairy-tale fantasy (of the Grimm-est variety), and stalker movie are brought together in a furious boil. Like a nightmarish premonition of stalker movies to come,Night of the Huntertells the suspenseful tale of a demented preacher (Robert Mitchum, in a performance that prefigures his memorable villain inCape Fear), who torments a boy and his little sister--even marries their mixed-up mother (Shelley Winters)--because he's certain the kids know where their late bank-robber father hid a stash of stolen money. So dramatic, primal, and unforgettable are its images--the preacher's shadow looming over the children in their bedroom, the magical boat ride down a river whose banks teem with fantastic wildlife, those tattoos of LOVE and HATE on the unholy man's knuckles, the golden locks of a drowned woman waving in the current along with the indigenous plant life in her watery grave--that they're still haunting audiences (and filmmakers) today.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["1558808590", "6301976126", "0784011451", "0792101448", "6304212151", "1558807780", "B000003NDA", "6301966430", "6301491920", "B00000F6MH", "6304366035", "6302226899", "0790743159", "6302413435", "6301586026", "0790741431", "6300208133", "6304429274", "0783217528", "6301797906", "6301798732", "0800100832", "B000GX7MMA", "B000054OW2", "6301977815", "B000056BRF", "B0000048YO", "B001E419N8", "630266232X", "6301978110", "6302968100", "6305237115", "6301564456", "0782008348", "0792115449", "6302353785", "6301964012", "630150528X"], "bought_together": ["1558808590"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 201324}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 18.88, "brand": "", "asin": "6301973232", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/717SP3TYNML._SY300_.gif", "title": "Night of the Hunter [VHS]"}

It also isn't really a horror film (though there are plenty of decapitations, zombies, supernatural demons, and gore) as much as it is a hilarious, sophisticated slapstick send-up of the terror genre. Raimi takes every horror convention that exists and exaggerates it with mind-blowing special effects, crossed with mocking Three Stooges humor. The plot alone is a genre clich&eacute; right out of any number of horror films. Several teens (including our hero, Ash, played by Bruce Campbell in a manic tour-de-force of physical comedy) visit a broken-down cottage in the woods--miles from civilization--find a copy of the Book of the Dead, and unleash supernatural powers that gut every character in sight. All, that is, except Ash, who takes this very personally and spends much of the of the film getting his head smashed while battling the unseen forces. Raimi uses this bare-bones story as a stage to showcase dazzling special effects and eye-popping visuals, including some of the most spectacular point-of-view Steadicam work ever (done by Peter Deming).

(In fact, the original theatrical aspect ratio ofThe Shiningwas 1.66:1, meaning that a relatively small portion of the image is lost.) Kubrick also chose mono over stereo,  believing that inconsistencies in theatrical sound systems resulted in loss of control over theatrical presentation.

(Remember, that was the year Norman Mailer's self-indulgence spilled all over the screen inTough Guys Don't Dance.) If this comedy had been made by unknowns, it would have simply faded into the obscurity it deserves. The fuss came about because May squandered much talent and a ridiculously large budget, rumored to exceed $40 million, returning less than half of that in ticket sales. Two artistically challenged lounge musicians (Warren Beatty and Dustin Hoffman) are jettisoned out of the States by their agent, who finds them a gig in Morocco. En route, they become pawns in an international power play between the CIA, the mythical emir of Ishtar, and upstarts hoping to overthrow the emir's regime. There are some humorous bits, such as when Hoffman and Beatty so badly perform their horrible ditties that audiences are left appalled. Most of the time however, we are the ones lulled into a near daze by a hokey script and boorish jokes about blind camels.

{"description": "This sensational, extremely influential, 1974 low-budget horror movie directed by Tobe Hooper (Poltergeist,Lifeforce,Salem's Lot), may be notorious for its title, but it's also a damn fine piece of moviemaking. And it's blood-curdling scary, too. Loosely based on the true crimes of Ed Gein (also a partial inspiration forPsycho), the original Jeffrey Dahmer,Texas Chainsaw Massacrefollows a group of teenagers who pick up a hitchhiker and wind up in a backwoods horror chamber where they're held captive, tortured, chopped up, and impaled on meat hooks by a demented cannibalistic family, including a character known as Leatherface who maniacally wields one helluva chainsaw. The movie's powerful sense of dread is heightened by its grainy, semi-documentary style--but it also has a wicked sense of humor (and not that camp, self-referential variety that became so tiresome in subsequent horror films of the '70s, '80s, and '90s). OK, in case you couldn't tell, it's \"not for everyone.\" But as a landmark in the development of the horror/slasher genre, it ranks withPsycho,Halloween, andA Nightmare on Elm Street.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305095566", "0792839242", "B00023NRSM", "6304983794", "6300214087", "6300267881", "6300214311", "6300214192", "6302038308", "B00000G1XV", "0792846710", "0792836634", "1452114498", "0792839234", "B00A82A7ZS", "B00009W0TZ", "6304240562", "6300214605", "B00018D454", "0790705141", "B00000F6FN", "6300183416", "0783216084", "6302862787", "6300262855", "0780616561", "6300182770", "B0000065MW", "6300214656", "B00079Z9X2", "6301996127", "6300182878", "6304819927", "B00000IQUT", "6304509154", "6302844207", "6301969782", "0783235607", "6301094352", "6302798450", "6303031846", "B00000JQTO", "6300218058", "0783246641", "079284632X", "B0032GEL54", "6303442315", "6304370458", "630026999X", "6300263681", "6300214826", "B00000JLWQ", "630533580X", "6301961404", "0764005707", "B00007L4N7", "6304288433", "6300189015", "6303954278", "B000AMW2TK", "6301589025", "B0053TWVT6", "6302968143", "6302878772", "B0000039A6", "B00005ATQA", "B000006FZ0", "6305939616", "0780627032", "B000A0GOH8", "6303359345", "B00000JQTR"], "also_viewed": ["6300214087", "B00023NRSM", "0792839242", "B00018D454", "B00L22H2IS", "6305095566", "B00LLAV26O", "6300189015", "0792836634", "0800187164", "6301589955", "B000099T3M", "6304819927", "0780616561", "630428845X", "B00IF8Q0YE", "B0000039A6", "B000I2J68M", "6300214605", "B00BM4Q4N0", "6300214311", "6303917461", "6303506291", "630130053X", "B004RE29PO", "6304509154", "B000VKL6Z2", "B00BCMT2BI", "1452114498", "B003UGLCIA", "B00BCMSY80", "B000KJU1KK", "B002YICNE2", "0783235607", "B00C7C00JU", "B00DEQQK8S", "B00000IQUT", "B0057O6IDW", "6304983794", "B005J9ZE5I", "B00G5GNYY2", "B00JHH1VSW", "6300267881", "B002UR4GDI", "B000009NQY", "B001JFZ1UE", "B008CYDDWI", "0783216084", "B003JIPN20", "B009DA743Y", "B00DI012O2", "6301792734", "B002OVO18A", "6300182878", "6302517036", "B00LBFFR2Y"]}, "price": 24.95, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 183169}, "asin": "6302921058", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71DZX9N6ZZL._SY300_.gif", "title": "Texas Chainsaw Massacre [VHS]"}

Seventeen years later, Griffin has grown up to be an aspiring journalist, but his parent's killer only now is being put to death.  Before the Sandman is executed, he invokes a black-magic ritual that allows him to come back to life as a creature of sand who can change shape at will.  His mission: to end Griffin's life, which mysteriously assures him immortality.  Although this diverting B-movie thriller gets grounded by low-grade effects, it works around it via Michael G.&nbsp;Wojciechowski's stylish cinematography;  the Sandman scattering to envelope one victim and later flying through air conditioning vents as a cloud of dust are effective.

{"description": "Rolling Thunder's ex-Vietnam War POW Major Charles Rane (William Devane) returns to a hero's welcome in San Antonio in the early '70s. He's bestowed with a red Cadillac convertible, $2,500 in silver dollars, and accolades from all sides. Soon, however, he discovers that all is not as it seems; his wife strayed with a close friend during his years of confinement. He also finds that he has his own personal POW groupie, Linda; her fascination with him is met with the same shoulder-shrugging blandness that he shows toward everything else in what's left of his life. One day Rane comes home to find a houseful of assorted Texas white trash demanding his small fortune in silver dollars. Their efforts to beat him into revealing the location of the money are for naught, so they jam his right hand down a garbage disposal instead. When his wife and kid come home, the two gladly give up the money but the robbers cold-bloodedly gun them down anyway. Flash-forward: Rane has himself fitted with a hook prosthesis (which he sharpens on a grinder), cuts down a couple of shotguns, and points the scarlet Caddy land yacht south towards Nuevo Laredo, bent on revenge. With Linda in tow, he tracks the bad guys as far as Acu&ntilde;a and Ju&aacute;rez, where he hooks up with war buddy Johnny (Tommy Lee Jones) for a final showdown. What would otherwise play as a routine revenge story is given a measure of dimension and depth by Devane's performance and Paul Schrader's script. The comparison to Schrader scripts such as the previous year'sTaxi Driverare inevitable and obvious. LikeTaxi Driver's Travis Bickle, Rane wears opaque state-trooper sunglasses that allow no window into his dead soul. However, Bickle's internal monologues are missing; all the audience can see of Rane's character is what's on the surface, only what Rane wants others to see. He's simply a vengeful automaton, riddled with a cold, poisonous, implacable rage. Strong stuff indeed.--Jerry Renshaw", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00140PKCS", "B0000065MY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 341958}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.58, "brand": "", "asin": "6303471617", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51F9HN6GKPL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Rolling Thunder [VHS]"}

When she learns of the presence of a high-class brothel in her neighborhood, she quietly goes to work there--but only during the day, until five o'clock in the afternoon. This sublime 1967 film is one of the latter-day masterpieces of the Spanish-born director Luis Bu&ntilde;uel, whose career forms one of the greatest and boldest arcs in cinema. By the time ofBelle de jour, Bu&ntilde;uel had become almost completely deadpan in his style, which not only leaves the motivation of S&eacute;verine a mystery (despite a few flashbacks to degradations of her youth), but also casts the entire plot in doubt. An old surrealist from the 1920s (when his first classic,Un chien andalou, was made in collaboration with Salvador Dali), Bu&ntilde;uel suggests that what we see may be real, or simply S&eacute;verine's imagination. Because he was the least pretentious of directors, Bu&ntilde;uel keeps his material playful, wicked, yet cutting. As S&eacute;verine, the impossibly lovely Catherine Deneuve uses her cool demeanor to great effect--she never breaks her deadpan, either.

All of this could have been broad satire, but  director Todd Haynes (Velvet Goldmine) opts for a filming style that captures the empty elegance of Carol's passive lifestyle and looks on with clinical dispassion, so that you can hear the oppressive quiet surrounding her. It's positively eerie, so you know you're not watching just a worthy cause picture or movie of the week. Haynes has more ambition than that, even going so far as to insert a slight buzzing sound in the soundtrack to accentuate the unease. Fluorescent lights? Power lines? Who knows? Maybe it's safe to call it the ominous rumblings beneath the surface of Carol's life, from antiseptic affluence to septic isolation in the spa environment.

{"description": "This sturdy Delmer Daves picture--his third with Glenn Ford, followingJubaland3:10 to Yuma--is one of the most offbeat Westerns ever. And it must be the most writerly, with Frank Harris's memoirs as the source and a picaresque screenplay by Edmund H. North and Dalton Trumbo (a blacklistee, credited only posthumously). There's a pileup of oddities and complications at the outset, with Chicago hotel clerk Harris (Jack Lemmon) already in mid-romance with a daughter of the Mexican aristocracy (Anna Kashfi--Mrs. Marlon Brando at the time), and Texas cattleman Tom Reese (Ford) storming in to commandeer an entire floor of the hotel for him and his drovers so they can party till, well, the cows come home. Partying is curtailed when Reese loses big at cards; Harris bails him out with his savings, and Reese finds he's taken on not only an unwanted partner but a tenderfoot besides. Soon everyone is headed south.Cowboymerits its bedrock title. This is a rare Western in which thejobof breaking horses, trail herding, etc. figures as a dynamic aspect of the storytelling. The film also has a blunt and original way of looking at death, not as a genre convention but as something abrupt, ungainly, and often absurd, in both senses of the word. (This applies equally to men and cattle, by the way.) The camerawork is trim, angular, and somehow precarious, and the jagged editing hustles the very eventful proceedings to a close in barely an hour and a half. Saddle up.--Richard T.

{"description": "Americans love the underdog. Anytime someone is beating the odds, fighting his or her way to the top, like the Little Engine That Could, it resonates well with U.S. audiences; it's in their nature. Sylvester Stallone knew that in 1976, whenRockywas a monstrous hit and established itself in the American cultural lexicon. His low-budget tale of a young boxer who came from the slums of Philadelphia and worked his way to the championship recalls Capra characters such as Mr. Smith or John Doe as he worked his way to fame and self-respect. Like Capra's films from 30 years before,Rockypushed emotional buttons with audiences, but in a somewhat less maudlin, obvious way; it's possible to enjoyRockywithout feeling embarrassed about it, even in the cynical, postironic '90s. It ranks respectably among the best boxing pictures, such asThe Set-UporSomebody Up There Likes Me. The story paralleled Stallone's own, from a relative unknown to a star with one breakthrough picture.Rocky II(1979) carries on the story line, playing on the rivalry between Rocky Balboa and nemesis Apollo Creed, while Balboa's wife fights for her life. Mainly, though, the sequel seems like a link between the first film andRocky III, in which an aging Rocky takes on big, bad Clubber Lang (the near-forgotten Mr. T). While playing on the same emotional capital as the first movie,Rocky IIIis the high-water mark of the sequels; by the next movie, Stallone had turned into a near-self-parody of the original character.Rocky IVfinds the underdog taking on an oversized, blond Russian boxer (Dolph Lundgren) in a cold war scenario (Rocky literally wraps himself in the American flag). The series mercifully played out by 1990, as embarrassingly punch-drunk as the Rocky character himself by that point. Given the way the American pop-culture continuum seems to work, it's probably due time for the later sequels to be plucked from the compost heap of '80s flotsam and revived as high camp; the Reagan-era hyperpatriotism ofRocky IVis as dated as in junk likeRed Dawnor the dreadfulInvasion U.S.A. Still, the first three films pack a satisfying emotional wallop without giving the viewer the urge to crawl under the couch. The last two... well, use your judgment.

{"description": "Having developed his skill as a master of contemporary crime drama, writer-director Michael Mann displayed every aspect of that mastery in this intelligent, character-driven thriller from 1995, which also marked the first onscreen pairing of Robert De&nbsp;Niro and Al Pacino. The two great actors had played father and son in the separate time periods ofThe Godfather, Part&nbsp;II, but this was the first film in which the pair appeared together, and although their only scene together is brief, it's the riveting fulcrum of this high-tech cops-and-robbers scenario. De&nbsp;Niro plays a master thief with highly skilled partners (Val Kilmer and Tom Sizemore) whose latest heist draws the attention of Pacino, playing a seasoned Los Angeles detective whose investigation reveals that cop and criminal lead similar lives. Both are so devoted to their professions that their personal lives are a disaster. Pacino's with a wife (Diane Venora) who cheats to avoid the reality of their desolate marriage; De&nbsp;Niro pays the price for a life with no outside connections; and Kilmer's wife (Ashley Judd) has all but given up hope that her husband will quit his criminal career. These are men obsessed, and as De&nbsp;Niro and Pacino know, they'll both do whatever's necessary to bring the other down. Mann's brilliant screenplay explores these personal obsessions and sacrifices with absorbing insight, and the tension mounts with some of the most riveting action sequences ever filmed--most notably a daylight siege that turns downtown Los Angeles into a virtual war zone of automatic gunfire. At nearly three hours, the film qualifies as a kind of intimate epic, certain to leave some viewers impatiently waiting for more action, but it's all part of Mann's compelling strategy.Heatis a true rarity: a crime thriller with equal measures of intense excitement and dramatic depth, giving De&nbsp;Niro and Pacino a prime showcase for their finely matched talents.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000003KHS", "6300183211", "B00000IO4G", "630018627X", "6303421563", "B00000JGEI", "6302415853", "630018403X", "0800199421", "6304258984", "0784011923", "6304259131", "6302482712", "6303953425", "B00007CVYA", "0783223218", "6300214540", "6302054982", "0790731274", "B00000ILE6", "0792147618", "079073799X", "6301208773", "6301888901", "0790701251", "0792133153", "6302378648", "6302282535", "6305718792", "6304414099", "6303696813", "0790748169", "B0002ZDVFE", "B000077VT7", "6303269834", "6302516919", "630428649X", "B00008R9K9", "6303036570", "6302814782", "0792116887", "0792158261", "0790705141", "6304508611", "6301071379", "B00005Q4GY", "076783819X", "6300214567", "6303020089", "6303383300", "6302945089", "B0002GTWOM", "B00003CXE6", "0792841778", "6301797930", "0800116917", "0800179552", "B0000040EJ", "B00005A7VC", "6300182878"], "also_viewed": ["B000003KHS"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 286071}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.98, "brand": "", "asin": "6304214502", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4160ZFH45VL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Heat [VHS]"}
{"description": "Faust is a 1994 Czech film directed by Jan &#x160;vankmajer. It merges live-action footage with stop-motion footage and includes imaginative puppetry and claymation. The Faust character is played by Petr &#x10C;epek. The film was produced by Jaromr Kallista. Although the film does not serve to accurately portray the Faustus legend, it utilizes the legend in a rather imaginative way, borrowing and blending elements from the story as told by Goethe and Christopher Marlowe with traditional folk renditions. It has a distinctly Modernist, Absurdist, Kafkaesque feel, especially with the setting in Prague. The tone is dark but humorous. The voices in the English version were provided by Andrew Sachs. The film was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 1994 Cannes Film Festival, and at the 4th Kecskemt Animation Film Festival where it won the Award of Adult Audience.", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305337144"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 496332}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 34.48, "brand": "", "asin": "6304239327", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/214MM019Z9L.jpg", "title": "Faust [VHS]"}

{"description": "In his writing and directorial debut, Julian Schnabel's filmBasquiatdepicts the life of graffiti artist Jean-Michel Basquiat, a.k.a. SAMO, and the turbulent period from the late 1970s to 1988, as his life was catapulted into fame and notoriety. As Jean-Michel's work gained favorable attention from New York's elite art community, he went from a street punk living in a cardboard box to the first black artist to succeed in the all-white dominated art world. Tony Award-winning actor Jeffrey Wright does a brilliant job portraying a man tortured by self-doubt and thoughts of suicide, struggling to survive and be acknowledged as an artist. The film's use of dreamlike imagery and rhythmic pace tells the story from the perspective of Jean-Michel's eyes as he manages to \"float\" through relationships and gallery showings, until his impending death in 1988 from a heroin overdose. Brimming with talent, the film also stars David Bowie as pop-artist Andy Warhol, Michael Wincott as poet Rene Ricard, and many others, including Gary Oldman, Benicio del Toro, Dennis Hopper, and Courtney Love.--Michele Goodson", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B000QUUD5G"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 342972}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 19.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6304343426", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51T29HM18CL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Basquiat [VHS]"}
{"description": "Michael Radford's adaption of George Orwell's foreboding literary premonition casts John Hurt and Suzanna Hamilton as lovers who must keep their courtship secret.  Aside from criminalizing sex and interpersonal relationships, the ruling party in their country Oceania both fabricates reality and reconstructs history for the sake of oppressing the masses.  They brainwash their citizens via large, propaganda-spewing TV monitors installed in their living rooms, which also inspect everyone's activities. Hurt and Hamilton are among the few we see desperately trying to fight the system by keeping control of their thoughts and beliefs.  While the atmosphere becomes a bit too stifling at times, the images are quite striking with their muted colors and dilapidated sets. In an interesting bit of casting, Richard Burton costars (in his final role) as a government agent who surreptitiously exposes Hurt to the ideas of resistance. Unlike many like-minded films,1984does not offer a flashy vision of the future, but then that aspect makes it feel all the more real.

{"description": "Winner of the 1997 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, this charming Czech drama uses the backdrop of the Russian military occupation in Prague for its funny, sad, and ultimately delightful story of a 55-year-old man's friendship with a 5-year-old boy. It doesn't exactly start out as friendship: Louka is a cellist who lost his symphony job after writing a sarcastic remark on an official form, and although he's struggling financially he still enjoys the company of several young women who find him irresistibly sexy. The last thing he needs is a surrogate child, but that's what he gets when young Kolya is abandoned by his mother, a Russian woman Louka had agreed to marry so she could avoid being sent back to Russia. The mother runs off to her boyfriend in Germany, leaving Louka with a 5-year-old kid who only speaks Russian! As directed by Jan Sver&aacute;k (whose father, Zdenek Sver&aacute;k, plays Louka), this predicament offers a lovingly detailed account of how Louka and Kolya discover each other, and how their mutual awkwardness evolves into a heartwarming father-son relationship. While the Russian presence creates an atmosphere of suspicion and restriction, the deepening connection between Louka and Kolya turns this into an unforgettable film, beautifully photographed, sensitively performed, and directed with just the right combination of subtle sentiment and harsh reality. Its Oscar was definitely well deserved.--Jeff Shannon", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 394678}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.35, "brand": "", "asin": "6304554168", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518KWY5H7AL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Kolya [VHS]"}

One of the most intelligently paranoid science fiction films ever produced, this pessimistic masterpiece functions as a dark flip side to the relatively optimistic alien-induced evolution theory presented in the later2001: A Space Odyssey.

A hit with parents and children alike, the film was followed by a sequel in 1996.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000633U3", "B00000JL8E", "B002GHHHNS", "0783219733", "B0000AK7AB", "B00007JMDX", "B000065V42", "B0068FYZ84", "B001JAVVBM", "B0000AOX0O", "B00AKGG6E8", "B00005LK94", "B00AEFXMMO", "B00008979O", "B00AEFXMSS", "B005RDRDLE", "B000B8QG2W", "B00009YXAW", "B00028HBES", "B000AJJNIG", "B008R65XKG", "B0087F7VSY", "B00002E229", "0792833759", "B0000VV4W2", "B000CR7RH0", "B000RMJ4F8", "B004GJYROG", "0783227965", "B00AFEX83C", "B00AEFXMGU", "B000B8QG4A", "B0000633U2", "B00GDT5T9Y", "B00H5NY7O0", "B000089771", "0792839749", "B002BIGCXS", "B0084IHVGG", "B000HWZ4QG", "0783219806", "B00005RRG7", "B000VBJEEG", "B000Y11B7G", "B000056H26", "B00005TSMN", "B00BG0RSJ4", "B0084IHVUC", "B00E9ZATKI", "0767836324", "B00005T7HZ", "B000YERP2S", "B001DPHDCY", "B001ILFUD2", "B008H6GHEM", "B002GIBVV6", "B0015RRNN4", "B005F96UJ6", "B000065V43", "B00008N6NQ", "B001KVZ6FW", "B000XKW2WG", "B001CTDH4Y", "B000068QPM", "0440413249", "B000XUOIQE", "B0001I562I", "B0001I563M", "B00CMDPTUY", "B00003CXB4", "B003TNS3HC", "B0009NZ2KG", "B001THIQFO", "B000P0J09W", "B003PIUIHE", "B0000VCZKM", "B0000640SC", "6305161887", "B0007KTBIU", "B005QODEEE", "B004HO6I4M", "B004ZBACOE", "B000031EGV", "B000TPTCP0", "B00AEFY8FO", "B000G75AZC", "B000050MN3", "B0055HK792", "B00003CXJ4", "B004OWQTZ0", "B000065V3A", "B00005RDST", "B0000844M8", "B000HT389E", "B00008L3T3", "6305320950", "B0000633U4", "B000FKP3XY", "B0000VV4WW"], "bought_together": ["B00000JL8E", "B000065V42"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000Y11B7G", "B00000JL8E", "B000065V42", "B008R65XKG"]}, "price": 9.66, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 3513}, "asin": "6304711913", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61GN498S74L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Homeward Bound - The Incredible Journey"}

{"description": "Asian American director Ang Lee sums up America in the early 1970s by focusing on the arrival of the sexual revolution in the 'burbs. Isolationism within a family, consumerism, and selfishness are personified by a cast that captures the self-obsession within two New England families. As the children struggle awkwardly with adolescence, their parents stumble through sexual experimentation. In the days of Watergate and Vietnam, society is breaking boundaries and ignoring convention. Following suit, these families are eschewing polite barriers and social taboos, with disastrous results. The \"ice storm\" of the title refers not only to a natural phenomenon but is a (rather heavy-handed) metaphor for a pervasive emotional temperament. The entire cast delivers textured, finely nuanced performances. This movie lingers in the psyche not only for the scope of the tragedy at its conclusion, but for Lee's often humorous and stingingly accurate assessment of pop culture. Based on Rick Moody's novel, this won the best-screenplay award at Cannes in 1997.--Rochelle O'Gorman", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 146644}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.0, "brand": "", "asin": "6304844964", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4125A7MPSWL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Ice Storm [VHS]"}

{"description": "When viewed from a cranky perspective, this by-the-book David versus Goliath story doesn't offer any surprises, and it's a bit sad to watch director Francis Coppola (who also adapted John Grisham's bestseller) squandering his once-glorious talent on such conventional Hollywood fare. In a more charitable light, however, there's great pleasure to be found in Coppola's intelligent, no-nonsense handling of a plot that's every bit as involving as it is formulaic. Coppola also knows how to bring out the best in a stellar cast, and this is the movie (released in November 1997, just a few weeks beforeGood Will Hunting) that signaled Matt Damon's arrival as a major-league star. Damon plays Rudy Baylor, a young rookie lawyer in Memphis (location of many Grisham stories) who takes on a powerful insurance company (led by shark-like lawyer Jon Voight) by representing the family of a boy who was denied potentially life-saving treatment for leukemia. Rudy also comes to the rescue of an abused wife (Claire Danes) and learns the tricks of the legal trade from a seasoned paralegal (Danny DeVito) who sees Rudy as his ticket out of the sleaze-ball practice run by a shady lawyer (Mickey Rourke). There's no mystery about where this plot is going, but Coppola takes us there in high style with a sharp script, and Damon strikes just the right note of naivete and strategic intelligence. When Goliath inevitably falls, this courtroom David wins fair and square.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6304259131", "6302935148", "0790748169", "B00020HABA", "B00003CXTF", "6305622825", "6305718792", "6303269834", "0792133153", "0783221347", "B00007CVYA", "6303313345", "6300183211", "B00004WIDB", "0790701251", "6302945089", "B00000IO4G"], "bought_together": ["6304259131"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 362387}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.24, "brand": "", "asin": "6304925131", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51362Y4QKQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Rainmaker [VHS]"}
{"description": "Lina Wertm&uuml;ller's harrowing 1976 film stars Giancarlo Giannini as a petty crook with seven unattractive sisters to support, and it features a picaresque, World War II-era journey through a prison asylum, army service, and a Nazi concentration camp. Wertm&uuml;ller is more indulgent in highbrow sadomasochism than she is real profundity, but there's no denying that the film is powerful in its story of subjugation and survival. A climactic scene in which Giannini saves his skin at the camp by seducing its disgusting female commandant is unnervingly honest.

{"description": "Basil Fawlty, as created and performed by John Cleese, is the rudest, most boorish, most hilariously obnoxious man on the face of the planet. What a natural for a TV sitcom! His screen wife, Sybil (Prunella Scales), put it best in the episode \"The Psychiatrist\": \"You're either crawling all over them, licking their boots, or spitting poison at them like some Benzedrine puff adder.\" He mockingly replies, \"Just trying to enjoy myself, dear.\" With his gangly frame and contortionist abilities, Cleese brilliantly punctuates Basil's outrageous faux pas with absurd gymnastics and turns Three Stooges-style pokes and kicks into a slapstick ballet. Scales's Sybil is the genial but obliviously chatty voice of reason and Andrew Sachs mangles the English language as the Spanish bellhop Manuel, whose struggles with simple directions results in comic lunacy reminiscent of Robert Benigni. After a six-episode run in 1975, Cleese and cowriter and costar Connie Booth (who plays Polly, the maid all too often pulled into Basil's ridiculous plans) reunited the cast in 1979 for another six episodes without missing a punch line. The four-volume collection contains all 12 shows, interspersed with interview segments featuring Cleese discussing the genesis of the series and anecdotes about the individual episodes. Remember to watch the opening credits of each show to spot the creative misspellings on the hotel sign (my favorite: \"Fatty Owls\").--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303631991", "6302293553", "B00004TJRU", "6304626495", "B000035P9O"], "bought_together": ["6303631991"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 434629}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 21.97, "brand": "", "asin": "6305076464", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5153HAF049L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Fawlty Towers - The Complete Collection [VHS]"}
{"description": "An economic crisis brings unemployed Nada (Roddy Piper) to L.A. in search of work.  What he finds instead is that the ruling elite of the world are aliens in disguise, their aim being to keep humans in a state of mindless consumerism.  His discovery comes when he dons a pair of special sunglasses made by a resistance group and sees for the first time reality unadorned.  Billboards, store signs, magazine covers--all bear subliminal messages to OBEY, to CONSUME, to have NO INDEPENDENT THOUGHT.  Money itself says THIS IS YOUR GOD. But worst of all, with these glasses you see which of us are really hideous, bug-eyed aliens.  The conceptual breakthrough is hilarious while keeping its roots in darker matters.  Although some fault the film for settling into its action plot, the ending has a great payoff. And the direction by John Carpenter is handled with superb workmanlike aplomb.

{"description": "German horror stylist Paul Leni (Variety) brings his expressionist flourishes to this compendium of haunted clich&eacute;s, creating one of the most stylish horror movie spoofs ever, a delightful mix of the gothic and the goofy. A greedy bunch of gargoyle-looking relatives (and a pair of young innocents) gather for the reading of a rich uncle's will, which demands that they spend the night in the creepy old mansion. Leni puts them through a fun house of frights: As if secret panels, clutching hands, and a stopped clock that mysteriously comes to life weren't enough, an escaped lunatic from a nearby asylum who rends his victims with catlike claws may have infiltrated the house. Silent movie sweetheart Laura La&nbsp;Plante is the canary of the title, a lovely would-be heiress who becomes the target of plotting relatives, but it's the rogues gallery of suspects that adds the color and comic relief. Leni kicks the film off with a delirious scene of an infirm old man surrounded by gigantic bottles of medicine and menaced by a snarling, spitting. gargantuan cat. The rest of the film is played in lower key, for laughs as much as chills, but it never loses its moody ambiance, highlighted by elegant camerawork and looming shadows. This classic has been remade three times, most famously by Bob Hope and Paulette Goddard in 1939, but never as well. The hilarious Harold Lloyd shortHaunted Spookshas been included as a DVD bonus.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00000ILEU", "B0000B1A1J", "B00006JMQG", "B005ETAN7C", "B00K7BCWLW", "B00006JMQI", "B0040QYROA", "B00006JMQH", "B00113ALKO", "B000035Z3K", "B00BBI7EZY", "B00KIZY3XW", "B00005RF2C", "B000TEUSI6", "B001M9ELJY", "B0009X770E", "B00DZP1C9K", "B00005UMF5", "B0000B1O9L", "B00014NF66", "B009KG7F30", "B000067IYD", "B00F3AE0MG", "B00F3AE1FW", "B0013XZ6SY", "B000VUQ4HW", "B0000694WH", "B0083Q4JXM", "B00007CVS8", "0780022343", "B005FQ2H0A", "B00GPPXNEE", "B00EVU3SO0", "B0009X75EC", "B00009PY4D", "B003E9SDBW", "B0045HCJJE", "B00005O5CF", "B00D9EJFV4", "B00009PY38", "B00D9BNOKK", "B004OOL73W", "B000WNHTCC", "B001CD6HQA", "B00AFQSZB0", "B00005ABVF", "B0040QYROK", "B000FWHW8Q", "B00D9BNONW", "B000GRUQJW", "B0045W9D48", "B00064AEWY", "B00006LHB8", "B0097C046W", "B00EO2I6RO", "B005QAGBY8", "B0012GVMIK", "B00DOZNI8Y", "B00180R06I", "B001D7T44C", "B00H4KQN82", "B001AD6UFA", "B003N2CVRC", "B0029BK1PW", "B00FMVV416", "B00E44EZUE", "B00000JQB7", "B00014NF6G", "B00064AEXI", "B002DHACSS", "B00310PSUI", "B00005O5CD", "B001BSBBMQ", "B003XF1VV6", "B000FS9FLW", "B005D0RDKM", "B00D8HNRBG", "B000FS4X64", "B00000JMOF", "B0063E00HU", "B001GOEYAG", "B000HT3QBO", "B00E18QKJ2", "B00027JYLC", "B0002KQNJU", "B00IF0KAYS", "B006FE83T0", "B005J7K9EG", "B00CTWSGA8", "B00DZP1C8Q", "B00DZP1BY6", "B00AQ6J4XM", "B00005O5CA", "B003MT2EK0", "B000TLTCT0", "B00DOZNGC2", "B00917IPOQ", "B00CUKTHES", "B00DI68EBK", "B005IX3C6S"], "bought_together": ["B00000ILEU", "B005ETAN7C"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005ETAN7C", "B0002TT0AK", "B000V3IXAA", "B00000ILEU"]}, "price": 32.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 625657}, "asin": "6305078947", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514CS6X8W5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Cat and the Canary"}

{"description": "The definitive American television series of the '90s comes to the big screen with an anticlimactic whimper. And how could it be otherwise? Why should material so perfectly realized in one medium necessarily translate well into another? The series is crisply and thoughtfully executed in just about every detail, but the heart of its appeal lies in the elegant handling of complicated and evolving ongoing story lines, which is not something movies are especially good at. The big-screen drive for closure cramps the creative style, though it may also help nonfans get a grip on the proceedings. We do get some invigorating thrills and chills, however, and a more satisfying sense of the scale of an all-enveloping human-alien conspiracy than ever before, but there's no more plot development here than in an average two-part season-ending. FBI black sheep Mulder and Scully have been temporarily transferred from the X-Files project to an anti-terrorist unit to investigate an Oklahoma City-style bombing. They uncover a new wrinkle in the Syndicate/Cancer Man conspiracy--basically an attempt to help one bunch of (benign?) aliens fight off another bunch who want to colonize Earth. A spectacular, ice-bound finale thrillingly staged by series-veteran director Rob Bowman offers Mulder (but not a conveniently unconscious Scully) his first clear look at a You Know What, which in some quarters qualifies as an epochal event. Martin Landau offers the agents some crucial clues, and several familiar TV faces (including the Lone Gunmen and Mitch Pileggi's indispensable Assistant Director Skinner) turn up briefly to wink knowingly at faithful fans.--David Chute", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B001FACH7S", "B001G7PSZI", "B000UZDO5I", "6303402348", "080010367X"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 338484}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.95, "brand": "20th Century Fox", "asin": "6305142467", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41GEJ8WNSKL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The X-Files (Movie) [VHS]"}
{"description": "Photographer and director Cindy Sherman has obviously always been interested in film. Her well-knownUntitled Film Stills, from movies that don't exist--pregnant scenes thatseemas though they arein medias resbut are really staged--feature diverse characters who, upon closer examination, prove to be Sherman herself, every time. Her 1998 film debut,Office Killer, takes her postmodern playfulness with such narrative frames out of the equation--and leaves us with something more flatly macabre and less subtle than Sherman's other work.Here, Carol Kane plays Dorine, a mousy, lonely, and introverted copyeditor for a consumer publication. Think for a moment what kind of person a copyeditor must be: this is the person whose job, whose passion, it is to know exactly where the apostrophe goes and to know the difference betweeneffectandaffect. The pressure can get to you.Tyrannized at home by a domineering mother and tyrannized at work by backstabbing coworkers, downsizing, and newfangled computers, Dorine finds that the copy she cleans up is her only pleasure in life. As pressure builds and builds--Kane's performance exhibits amazing mastery of body language--Dorine finally caves and steps into an insanity that, in a horrifying, animalian fashion, has its own pleasantness and reason. Despite Kane's strong acting here, she is supported by flattish performances from Molly Ringwald, Jeanne Tripplehorn, and Barbara Sukowa.It is unclear if Sherman means to serve or redefine the concept of narrative through this emotional detachment she brings to the screen. Certainly, this isn't a conventional film, and its cinematography and innovative story are indeed attention-keeping, even entertaining, on a horror-flick level at least. If her goal is to serve narrative canonically, then she fails almost miserably. If her goal is to redefine narrative, then she may have achieved something here that most critics aren't clueing into. It's just unclear what this achievement is.--Erik J.

{"description": "Werner Herzog's remake of F.W. Murnau'soriginal vampire classicis at once a generous tribute to the great German director and a distinctly unique vision by one of cinema's most idiosyncratic filmmakers. Though Murnau'sNosferatuwas actually an unauthorized adaptation of Bram  Stoker'sDracula, Herzog based his film largely on Murnau's conceptions--at times directly quoting Murnau's images--but manages to slip in a few references to Tod Browning'sfamous version(at one point the vampire comments on the howling wolves: \"Listen, the children of the night make their music.\"). Longtime Herzog star Klaus Kinski is both hideous and melancholy as Nosferatu (renamed Count Dracula in the English language version). As in Murnau's film, he's a veritable gargoyle with his bald pate and sunken eyes, and his talon-like fingernails and two snaggly fangs give him a distinctly feral quality. But Kinski's haunting eyes also communicate a gloomy loneliness--the curse of his undead immortality--and his yearning for Lucy (Isabelle Adjani) becomes a melancholy desire for love. Bruno Ganz's sincere but foolish Jonathan is doomed to the vampire's will and his wife, Lucy, a holy innocent whose deathly pallor and nocturnal visions link her with the ghoulish Nosferatu, becomes the only hope against the monster's plague-like curse. Herzog's dreamy, delicate images and languid pacing create a stunningly beautiful film of otherworldly mood, a faithful reinterpretation that by the conclusion has been shaped into a quintessentially Herzog vision.--Sean Axmaker", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 272814}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "title": "Nosferatu the Vampyre [VHS]", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000056NW6", "6302783356", "B000VUQ4HW", "6304509154"], "also_viewed": ["6302194296", "B00EO2I6RO"]}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5123FXMFFAL._SY300_.jpg", "asin": "630526323X"}

{"description": "Generally acknowledged as a bona fide classic, this Francis Ford Coppola film is one of those rare experiences that feels perfectly right from beginning to end--almost as if everyone involved had been born to participate in it. Based on Mario Puzo's bestselling novel about a Mafia dynasty, Coppola'sGodfatherextracted and enhanced the most universal themes of immigrant experience in America: the plotting-out of hopes and dreams for one's successors, the raising of children to carry on the good work, etc. In the midst of generational strife during the Vietnam years, the film somehow struck a chord with a nation fascinated by the metamorphosis of a rebellious son (Al Pacino) into the keeper of his father's dream. Marlon Brando played against Puzo's own conception of patriarch Vito Corleone, and time has certainly proven the actor correct. The rest of the cast, particularly James Caan, John Cazale, and Robert Duvall as the rest of Vito's male brood--all coping with how to take the mantle of responsibility from their father--is seamless and wonderful.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["630021639X", "6302158176", "6300183211", "6304214502", "6300214826", "0790705141", "6303168507", "0790733927", "B00003CXE6", "630470786X", "6300267997", "0790741512", "6303471501", "6300271331", "6302054982", "6303686796", "B00005PJ8I", "B00004COR2", "0792842111", "6304258984", "6304509146", "0783216084", "6300215644", "6300216500", "B000062XM6", "0800199421", "B0002F6BQU", "0800116917", "630336568X", "6304508611", "B00000F13T", "6304935811", "6305363668", "B000005PFL", "6300182878", "0792116887", "6300182452", "B00005B238", "0792845684", "6300247171", "0792839846", "6302482712", "6302989787", "0790732017", "0800100832", "630442972X", "6304196954", "B000065U6Q", "6301208773", "B00000K2SC", "6302842263", "6304429274", "6303313345", "B0000A36J1", "B000059XY5", "079212569X"], "bought_together": ["630021639X", "6302158176"], "also_viewed": ["6302610702", "630021639X", "6301792734", "6303402348", "6300215830", "6304117752", "6300183211", "6302158176", "B00COYZF5A", "6300214060", "B000NTPDSW", "6305095566", "0792151712", "6305169187", "6303953425", "080010367X", "6302054982", "6301208773", "B000KX0ISG", "630310696X", "6302415853", "6304214502", "B00005B238", "6303168507", "B00E9PMMX0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 270877}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.98, "brand": "", "asin": "B000003KHS", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/11KQ3QC757L.jpg", "title": "The Godfather [VHS]"}

Kirsten Dunst stars as Torrance Shipman, the ditzy but loveable high school senior who is newly elected team captain of her high school cheerleading team. But when a replacement cheerleader, Missy Pantone, walks in to the Toros' cheerleading squad (hilariously portrayed by Eliza Dushku), she shows Torrance that the team's cheers are ripped off from the East Compton Clovers, and you can believe that the Clovers are fed up with the stealing. Torrance, horrified that her cheerleading career has been a fake, makes an effort to be original, but the result is a humiliating performance at a competition. Torrance is comforted by love interest Cliff Pantone (played by hottie Jesse Bradford), Missy's REALLY cute twin brother, and a romance begins. As the movie leads up to the UCA Nationals competition, the Clovers and Toros fight for the win. Who will it be? Well you better watch it for yourself. Bring It On is a refreshing change from the immature sick sex movies and it instead is fresh, bright, witty, and very funny. I recommend Bring It On to anyone.", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B000WC39KE", "6304434340", "B003QZSWU6"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 424035}, "asin": "B00003CXMO", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51VN6MTN3AL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Bring It on [VHS]"}

The end result is the lightest Disney film in many a moon, a joyous romp akin toAladdinin its quotient of laughs for kids and adults. The original story centers on the spoiled teenage emperor Kuzco (David Spade), who enjoys getting the best of his Aztecan subjects. When he fires Yzma (Eartha Kitt), his evil sorceress, she seeks revenge and turns Kuzco into a llama with the help of her hunk of the month, a lunk named Kronk (Patrick Warburton). Alone in the jungle, the talking llama is befriended by Pacha (John Goodman), who has just been told to vacate his pastoral home by the human Kuzco. What's an ego to do? That's pretty much the story and the characters--simple, direct, fun--a Disney film on a diet. For any fan of the acidic humor of Spade, this is essential viewing. As narrator of his tale, Kuzco uses a sarcastic tone to keep the story jumping with plenty of fun asides (he even \"stops\" the film at one point to make sure you know the story is abouthim). Even better is character actor Warburton (Elaine's stuck-up boyfriend onSeinfeld), who steals every scene as the dim-witted, but oh-so-likable Kronk.

{"description": "Employing shock techniques and sound design in a relentless sensory assault,Requiem for a Dreamis about nothing less than the systematic destruction of hope. Based on the novel by Hubert Selby Jr., and adapted by Selby and director Darren Aronofsky, this is undoubtedly one of the most effective films ever made about the experience of drug addiction (both euphoric and nightmarish), and few would deny that Aronofsky, in following his breakthrough filmPi, has pushed the medium to a disturbing extreme, thrusting conventional narrative into a panic zone of traumatized psyches and bodies pushed to the furthest boundaries of chemical tolerance. It's too easy to call this a cautionary tale; it's a guided tour through hell, with Aronofsky as our bold and ruthless host.The film focuses on a quartet of doomed souls, but it's Ellen Burstyn--in a raw and bravely triumphant performance--who most desperately embodies the downward spiral of drug abuse. As lonely widow Sara Goldfarb, she invests all of her dreams in an absurd self-help TV game show, jolting her bloodstream with diet pills and coffee while her son Harry (Jared Leto) shoots heroin with his best friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) and slumming girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly). They're careening toward madness at varying speeds, and Aronofsky tracks this gloomy process by endlessly repeating the imagery of their deadly routines. Tormented by her dietary regime, Sara even imagines a carnivorous refrigerator in one of the film's most memorable scenes. And yet... does any of this have a point? Is Aronofsky telling us anything that any sane person doesn't already know?Requiem for a Dreamis a noteworthy film, but watching it twice would qualify as masochistic behavior.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0057ZAA6W", "B00005JM23", "6305594333", "B0007CEXYK", "B00005YUPD", "078401213X", "1560252480", "B00H3JHGBC", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00005JMJG", "B000I0QL7I", "B0009A40ES", "B00049QQHI", "B00005ATQB", "B000LAZDPG", "B00003CXZ4", "0792838068", "B0000AC8LR", "0783229526", "6305692572", "B0041KKYEM", "B000QGEB1M", "B00008977H", "B001AR60GK", "B000MGB6NM", "B0045HCJ08", "6305313687", "B001TOD92C", "B00009Y3QI", "B000NO39FG", "B000JBXXYK", "B00008975Z", "6305162026", "B00004UEDQ", "B000068MC2", "B00606OZUY", "B00003CWQR", "B000ERVK4Y", "B000A7DVR2", "B000A9QK6E", "B00EUENWIY", "B0016MJ6T2", "B00005JPAR", "B00008MTXI", "B004SIP95G", "B00AEFXESQ", "B000JMK6LW", "B00004Y6Q5", "B000FVQLQQ", "B000BYA5G4", "B00005JKJA", "B00005JKM2", "B0029LHW68", "B000BBOUUE", "B004FQX5B6", "B000PAAJZ6", "B000N3SU92", "B003YKYX9M", "B00AEBB8O2", "B00007AJF8", "B00A2H9QN8", "B0009WFEDC", "B00GUO2SKA", "B00013RC2K", "B000A7Q2DM", "B00003CXWV", "0792845803", "B001URA5Y8", "B00195I3O0", "B00006AFUR", "B000063JDE", "B00BMKGZVA", "B00AEBB8NI", "B00112S8RS", "B00177YA6U", "0767837398", "B000O76ZQC", "B0052ADP6Y", "B000J10F8C", "B000E6ESU8", "B00009OOFH", "B00005JLRE", "B0059GVBHG", "0767824954", "B00005JLWN", "B00E8G5GU6", "B000QXDCLA", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00004ZETA", "B00AEBB9CS", "B000021Y77", "B00011CZRE", "B002VECM4A", "B00003CXKS", "B006KH6CF4", "B000K7VHQE", "6305127654", "B00AFEXRME", "B004SIP7ZS", "B00020HB32"], "bought_together": ["B0057ZAA6W", "B00005JM23"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005JMJG", "B000MEYKD2", "B0057ZAA6W", "B00005JPAR"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 222264}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 15.36, "brand": "", "asin": "B00003CXP1", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/519CB9K0QML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut"}

{"description": "When 12-year-old Renato, riding through his small Italian town on his new bicycle, sees the voluptuous Mal&egrave;na, little does he know he's launching on an infatuation that will carry him through the tumultuous days of World War II.Mal&egrave;nabegins as an enraptured depiction of Renato's adolescent mind--the way he stares, hypnotized, at Mal&egrave;na's garters pressing through the material of her tight skirt, or his frustrated rebellion against the indignity of wearing short pants--but soon transforms into a portrait of small-town prejudice. Mal&egrave;na's looks spark lust and envy in the townspeople; when her husband dies in combat, the gossip only intensifies, to the point that Mal&egrave;na is dragged into court to defend herself against accusations of adultery. When the women of the town refuse to sell her edible food at the market, Mal&egrave;na has little choice but to become what she's been unjustly accused of being. At the end, a twist of fate turns this tale of longing and jealousy into a heartbreaking love story. Monica Bellucci exudes the can't-help-it eroticism that makes Mal&egrave;na such a lightning rod for everyone's desires; she's like a more zaftig Isabelle Adjani. The movie seems to wander at times, but the ending has a powerful emotional impact.

BATS is a jolting ride of sight, sound and fear.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005NKC6", "B001221DUG", "B002NZK5U0", "6305943133", "6305090564", "B00L8QOZK6", "B00018D3UU", "B00000IQC4", "B0006HBZYC", "6305258287", "B00JJOY45U", "B004CZZZEK", "B008DL4LQ2", "B001YYQ9S8", "B002K0WBVE", "0767802497", "B002GHHHL0", "B00AIZ2FPK", "B00AEFYXQI", "B0001FGBWU", "B00064X5L6", "B0079K4W9E", "B00005O5B5", "B003ZZ7TPG", "B0000JCFN6", "B00BNAE14W", "B000WTVZGC", "B00JJOY496", "0783225547", "B002I41KNC", "0767818024", "B00EDOS600", "0767817478", "B001DSNEK6", "B000OVLBHG", "B004P7CN3G", "B002NN7EY2", "B00AEFXPSK", "B00441GYZG", "B000BQ7J98", "B001AR0D54", "B00005K3O1", "B004S8UTII", "6305120021", "B003954IV0", "B004K4FUVQ", "B001B8XRT6", "B00003CY6P", "B0002W4SBI", "B00007AJG3", "B0009S4II8", "B00A1AU74I", "B00AEFY6PQ", "B00AEFYV9W", "B00JJOY47I", "B000A2X40G", "B00005N5RM", "B00008WJDW", "B0017DQFB2", "B000JBXHQY", "B0001FVDQ4", "B002ZG98KK", "B004AC6PMG", "B0055SJW10", "B001NFNFFS", "B00IJS2OXG", "B001B3LIM4", "B00111YM5Q", "B00JJOY41E", "B003VA3JUO", "0800177789", "B000FUF6Z4", "6305645515", "B00004STDN", "B004RBC5S8", "B00JHH22O4", "0792841328", "B00C3OX0H6", "B00005RHGK", "B000A7Q1UQ", "B000AM6OQ2", "B00AEFYSR2", "B004LWZW6K", "B0000ALPFL", "B000MM0LIM", "B004I9SJG6", "B00004YS98", "B00008WFU5", "B000MEYKEQ", "B000N4RAS8", "B0007R4TR6", "B000053UIF", "B00005AVZS", "0783222149", "B000CSUNLG", "B000EHSVPK", "B00003CWRF", "B005ETANC2", "0783226934"], "bought_together": ["B002NZK5U0", "B00000IQC4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0974237922", "B00000IQC4", "B004CZZZEK", "B002NZK5U0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 78204}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.39, "brand": "Columbia/Tristar Studios", "asin": "B00003L9CQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZC9X6AMSL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Bats"}

{"description": "The four-episodeSamurai Xoriginal animation video captures the mixture of swordplay and poetry that makes Japanese warrior culture so intriguing to viewers on both sides of the Pacific. The OAV series serves as a prequel to bothSamurai X: The Movieand the more lighthearted TV series. The action unfolds in 1864, when a few clans began the revolt that would overthrow the military dictatorship of the Tokugawa Shogunate and return power to the Emperor in the Meiji Restoration of 1868. Shinta, a lonely orphan, is transformed by master swordsman Hiko into Kenshin Himura, an assassin in the service of Katsuga, one of the revolutionary leaders. Kenshin kills whomever Katsuga orders with consummate skill and unshatterable calm. He believes he is using his sword to bring about a better world, even as the intrigues and counter-intrigues escalate. But he becomes aware of unspoken doubts when he meets Tomoe, a mysterious girl whose beauty, like the iris, is seen to best advantage in cloudy weather. Director Kazuhiro Furuhashi choreographs the sword fights with a grace that infuses even scenes of extreme violence with an elegant sensuality: in one striking image, he focuses on the rain washing a spatter of blood from Tomoe's cheek. The dialogue in the English translation often sounds stilted, but the words are usually superfluous. Furuhashi's ability to present a story visually has madeSamurai Xa popular anime property in America and Japan. Unrated; suitable for ages 18 and up for explicit violence.--Charles Solomon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000050GC8", "B0000844K0", "B000056HOW", "B00B209RHY", "B00393SFW0", "B0049TC8AI", "B008NNY9YE", "B00BQ1DDUG", "B00AUJH32E", "B00AO05AN8", "B00005V1XW", "B002HW5G2Q", "B000C6NP8Q", "B001F2U700", "B000QUEQ86", "B00102FF7U", "B001AI7766", "B003VOVW90", "B0049TC8C6", "B004GZZH6W", "B0071LEO08", "B00CU6WC94", "B00AUJH39M", "6304493681", "B007V9ECYI", "B00018WL1C", "B00CJ7Y0US", "B002JVWRAO", "B001C4ZQEI", "B00CRRCF20", "B008UE8ICK", "B009AVC922", "B008YRL6WM", "B00CU6WBMW", "B00441GYS8", "B001K98M4Q", "B00HXEWDDS", "B009RZ890M", "B008YRL7JE", "B0038QIYVA", "B005HVWW6M", "B002Y0KR70", "B000F6ZIFQ", "B006O94DLI", "B009AVCAJ4", "B00004YZGB", "B004W75BQU", "B000X5SPBI", "B000055Y0R", "B00004ZBHR", "B00005NB8I", "B0030ZOYHC", "B00005LMB1", "B000056KN5", "B00005IBT2", "B00005KB6E", "B000059H6J", "B00004U5RY", "B00005UQ6F", "B00005ALLV", "B00005O5AS", "1586551027", "B0000633QS", "B000063IMS", "B000065AYO", "B0000639EQ", "B00005B1VO", "6305536813", "B00005U11V", "B003NE8B2Y", "B003NE8B3I", "B00006IUFT", "B00005AVS2", "B00018D5QW", "B00007G1U6", "B00005QCVZ", "B00005IC0I", "B00000JKNX", "B0001NBMU8", "B0000Z050A", "6305596344"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00008G8PP", "B000056HOW", "B00B209RHY", "B0000844K0"]}, "price": 45.3, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 186772}, "asin": "B00004YKPY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51JH3XX15TL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Samurai X: Trust"}

{"description": "Having taken Shakespeare at his word onHamlet(i.e., not cutting  a single syllable out of a very long play), Kenneth Branagh selects a more radical approach withLove's Labour's Lost. Here the prolific director-star weeds out much of the play's dialogue and adds songs and dances of a decidedly modern bent. The King of Navarre (Alessandro Nivola, Nicolas Cage's wacko brother inFace/Off) and his three comrades (Branagh, Matthew Lillard, Adrian Lester) take a vow:  no womanly distractions while they pursue their studies. Ah, but at that very moment, floating down a magical studio-built river, is the queen of France (Alicia Silverstone), accompanied by three ladies-in-waiting. You do the math. Branagh has set the tale on the eve of the Second World War, which allows for the inclusion of vintage pop songs, including \"Cheek to Cheek,\" \"The Way You Look Tonight,\" and a rousing chorus of \"There's No Business Like Show Business,\" led by--who else?--Nathan Lane. The fact that most of the cast members are not accomplished song-and-dance folk is clearly meant to charm, but the results are spotty at best. Perhaps the most dynamic performer is Natascha McElhone (memorable fromRonin), whose aristocratic bearing and bottomless eyes lend a gravity to the material that is otherwise absent from Branagh's twinkly staging. The play contains some of Shakespeare's loveliest paeans to the language of love, yet Branagh seems to be in a hurry to juice everything up lest the audience lose interest. The labor shows.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00CDV4JNS", "B0000714BZ", "079284615X", "B004M9ZI0M", "B00005S872", "B00005JLCI", "6305622876", "B00000JL7T", "B000HWZ4AC", "B00A7OBIGO", "B004H0M31I", "B001TR4G6W", "B0002TVWYW", "B003TRS8XM", "B0013D8LWC", "B00019072G", "B00443FMKM", "B00DQN6IOK", "B007RP4CAA", "B007H7OQW2", "B00ECR7KX2", "B000BP86VE", "B00AMEZDPG", "B00004TB8E", "B004P29LDG", "B000QGE8JC", "B000QGE8IS", "B00006G8HO", "B000777I88", "B007CJL17S", "B0007CNXV4", "B0009ZE9EY", "B007I1Q50S", "B003TRS8VY", "B00AJER4EM", "B000Q7ZNDG", "B00B2BYY1W", "1904271103", "B004SIP83Y", "B00B1E6EAY", "B00ECR7L0Y", "B0038RSJ0U", "B00005JKGX", "B0079K4YL0", "B003X82D1K", "B0007LFPJ8", "0769712231", "B00009MEJ4", "B001LPWGHS", "B007RP4BZ6", "B00ANQHR7U", "B00AZFECHW", "B0002235QM", "B000OY9VFW", "B004U7MQZ6", "B00AEFYO08", "B000056HEA", "B008SBXFUU", "0784001332", "B004Q8D1FS", "0983502714", "B003NEQ0X6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0000714BZ", "B00CDV4JNS", "6305622876", "B00ECR7KX2"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 91030}, "asin": "B00004Z4WW", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51E9F76ZR4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Love's Labour's Lost"}

{"description": "Buffy Summers (Sarah Michelle Gellar) looks like your typical perky high-schooler, and like most, she has her secret fears and anxieties. However, while most teens are worrying about their next date, their next zit, or their next term paper, Buffy's angsting over the next vampire she has to slay. See, Buffy, a young woman with superhuman strength, is the \"chosen one,\" and she must help rid the world of evil, namely by staking demons. The exceptional first season ofBuffy the Vampire Slayerintroduces us to the treacherous world of Sunnydale High School (where Buffy moved after torching her previous high school's gym). The characters there include \"watcher\" Giles (Anthony Stewart Head) and the original \"Scooby Gang\" members--friendly geek Xander (Nicholas Brendon), computer whiz Willow (Alyson Hannigan), and snobbish popular girl Cordelia (Charisma Carpenter)--who aid Buffy in her quest. Those used to the darker tone thatBuffytook in its later seasons will be surprised by the lighter feeling these first 12 episodes have--it's kind of likeBuffy 90210as the cast grapples with regular teen problems in addition to saving the world from demonic darkness. Fans of the show will enjoy the crisp writing, the phenomenal chemistry of the cast (already well-established within the first few episodes), and the introduction to characters that would stay for many seasons, including moody vampire Angel (David Boreanaz). Through it all, Gellar carries the series with amazing confidence, whether conveying the despair of high school or dispatching various demons--she's one of TV's most distinctive and strongest heroines.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000EHSVL4", "B000EHSVLE", "B000EHSVLY", "B000EHSVM8", "B000EHSVN2", "B000EHSVMS", "B000I0QLQY", "B000I0QLR8", "B000I0QLRI", "B000I0QLRS", "B000I0QLS2", "B0006IUE16", "B000HD1482", "B0009W5J4Q", "B007H9CNOI", "B000B5XOW0", "B003YF9Q08", "B000CCBCGM", "B005CM1IIE", "B000ERVJM2", "B000GG4Y6O", "B000OIOPHC", "1593078226", "B00344EAQO", "B0046XG48O", "B00133QNRW", "B00001R3O1", "B000JLTRIG", "B00466H3CW", "B00006J3WH", "1442412097", "B0000AQS0F", "1595821651", "B002JVWR9U", "B000BOH986", "B000QDLSR0", "B00133QNS6", "B002U8XW9Q", "0789326302", "B00JF5GAZA", "B000FP2OPY", "B00A8KJN8M", "067103541X", "B000FL7CAK", "B00JF5G8WU", "B0024FAR66", "B003IMERF6", "0671042599", "B000W089VU", "B000BW7QWW", "B004SIP9P6", "B009LDCXNY", "B006LG74Q0", "B0001JXPPC", "B00006FD9N", "159307784X", "B002JVWR4A", "159307963X", "B000P0I4P8", "B000BOH98G", "B001M5UDGS", "B002JVWR4U", "B000GG4Y28", "B000RO6JYK", "B00133QNSG", "B000KLQUMG", "0671024337", "B000HT3P60", "B008X6N8KW", "B00005V6BG", "B000NA2BEU", "B000R9YLKY", "B000RW3VDE", "B0058YPGL6", "B000CNE0SS", "B005GP7ELM", "B003L77GH4", "B000AJJNFE", "B0001GF2F6", "B000A5045Q", "B009LDCWWG", "1595825584", "B000LC4ZIA", "B000G1R4RK", "B002BAW6HW", "B00HEQOAIQ", "B001992NWO", "B000X5SPBI", "B000GBEWSO", "B000R7I44K", "B002JVWR54", "B001ILFUA0", "B003L77GAQ", "B00005JLKB", "B000N6TYLW", "B001L1S1OY", "B000EWBNMS", "B00018D42W", "B0043CT976", "B00BBXSPES"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0046XG48O", "B000EHSVLY", "B000EHSVL4", "B000EHSVLE"]}, "price": 1.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 129374}, "asin": "B00005221I", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DJ570H6VL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Buffy The Vampire Slayer - The Complete First Season"}
{"description": "Russ Duritz (Bruce Willis) is an ultracynical, 40-year-old L.A. image consultant who fashions bogus fa&ccedil;ades for scumbag clients. Oblivious to his own need for a makeover, he's a tyrant in the office (to the chagrin of his sarcastic assistant, played to perfection by Lily Tomlin), and he's emotionally unavailable to the morally centered woman (Emily Mortimer) who senses goodness beneath Russ's hardened veneer. Not a moment too soon, a pudgy kid (Spencer Breslin) mysteriously appears in Russ's life, revealing himself to be Rusty Duritz--that is, Russ's 8-year-old self, arriving by some magic to put the adult Russ's life into beneficial perspective. This variation onA Christmas Carolhas Rusty guiding Russ on a tour of his past to reveal how he became a loveless, hard-shelled loser. It takes a bit of smarmy chicken-soup psychology to explain it all, butThe Kidis an otherwise charming and involving fantasy, suggesting that perhaps we'd all benefit from a bit of counseling by our younger selves. Written with admirable restraint by Audrey Wells (who brought a similar appeal toThe Truth About Cats and Dogs) and directed by Jon Turteltaub (Cool Runnings), the movie doesn't force its supernatural elements or attempt to explain Rusty's existence. It's just a fable for our modern age and a reminder to embrace the better angels of our nature. Delivered with an easy blend of humor and sentiment, that message makesThe Kidan unexpected pleasure.

First-time writer-director Jennifer ChambersLynch (The Diary of Laura Palmer) brings \"stylistic flair\" (The Washington Post) to this haunting, erotic tale of love and lust that straddles the fine line between devotion and obsession.  Nick Cavanaugh (Julian Sands, Timecode) is a brilliant surgeon who seems to haveit allmoney, looks, prestigebut all he wants is someone he can't have a voluptuous, cold-hearted seductress: Helena (Sherilyn Fenn, Three of Hearts). After Nick fails to impress her withhis wealth, Helena is struck down by a hit-and-run driver outside his mansion. The good doctor saves her life by amputating her legs, then seizes the opportunity of her immobility to hold her prisoner.

{"description": "Heavy on atmosphere and light on everything else,From Hellis visually impressive while lacking the depth of the acclaimed graphic novel it's based upon. Making their third feature since 1993'sMenace II Society, twins Allen and Albert Hughes approach the Jack the Ripper case with physical precision, re-creating the gritty Whitechapel district of 1888 London in meticulous detail. What they've forgotten is the sheer terror that gripped Whitechapel in the wake of the Ripper's slaying of five prostitutes, investigated here by a Scotland Yard sleuth (Johnny Depp) who uses opium, laudanum, and absinthe to fuel his semiprescient visions of the slayings. Heather Graham attempts a slippery Cockney accent as a would-be victim, while Ian Holm steals the show as a has-been surgeon with devilish delusions of grandeur. Violence is obliquely suggested or briefly graphic, but no matter how you cut it,From Hellis only marginally thrilling as it treads familiar territory.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEBBA72", "B000NQRR1Q", "B004P7CNC2", "B00005R87R", "B000F7CECK", "B00AEBBAEK", "B00000IRE6", "B002QEHPQU", "B0002234LS", "B008QE9XD2", "B0000VD04M", "B0009UZG0K", "0780621611", "B006ISJQ1W", "B004SIP7PS", "B0000AC8LI", "B00347AIOE", "B00003CXWV", "B003HKN52U", "B001HN69AY", "B000053VAZ", "B000TGJ80S", "B0012Q7M02", "B00AEBB9F0", "B002Q3MYA8", "B00C888MJ8", "B00004XPPB", "B000FDEV3Y", "0780628551", "0783229526", "B001HN694K", "B0000WN140", "B0009IOR6Q", "B00F84H73Q", "B00003CXRG", "B001GCUO0W", "B004A8ZWSS", "B004SIP6BI", "B00004W4UB", "B000N2HDJQ", "B000C3L27U", "B000GCFO0I", "B000BB1MI2", "B005S9EJ8W", "B0009XRZKQ", "B00AEBB89W", "B008R65Y28", "B001I04QCO", "B00008LUNW", "B00005JLKN", "B003Y5H54W", "B0012QE4Q2", "B00DZP1C2W", "B00AEBB8NI", "B00JPFTX5O", "B0000TPA0G", "B001AGXEAG", "B0041KKYEM", "B00J5JSV3A", "B000069I1I", "B002UOMH00", "B004SIP92O", "B001A50716", "B005LAIHYU", "B0002KVUKM", "B005COPWZW", "B0036BDQ7Y", "B000UJ48P4", "B004SIP7TE", "B0031U8OEK", "0783116934", "B005LAIHXQ", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B000063US5", "B00005JLQN", "B00DHD933W", "B002AF4Y9G", "B000LP6KNU", "B008JFUNYG", "B0021L8V34", "B001D2WU9I", "B007XF0W3K", "B003AWRMBU", "B00009MEKN", "B00HRCATDW", "B0020PFYHC", "B00003CXKM", "B004SUDQ4A", "B0010DR4BO", "B0097C046W", "B00IKM5LXG", "B000FAOC2W", "B004SIP9Z6", "B00K6D1RVW", "B002ZG97CO", "B00151QYXU", "B005LAIH2C", "6301971345", "6304712499", "B003H5WF3U"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AEBBA72", "B004P7CNC2", "B00005R87R", "B000NQRR1Q"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 164982}, "asin": "B00005JKJM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/418JG1F78JL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "From Hell (Two-Disc Special Edition)"}

Along the way, there's a lot of  heartbreak and female bonding (not to mention a lot of midriff-baring--in  her first scene, Spears jumps on her bed in her underwear, singing along  to a Madonna song), as each of the three girls learns more about herself  and life.Crossroadscould have been trite schmaltz, but the script  has some grit and the direction is fresh and relaxed--and, most  significantly, Spears is far more sympathetic and engaging than you might  expect.

{"description": "Outstanding picture and sound plus tons of features makeCharlie's Angels: Full Throttlea fully loaded DVD.  Don't expect more T&A; in the unrated edition, however.  The only difference is glimpses of more intense violence in a few of the fight scenes.  For example, in the theatrical version you'll see an angel flying through the air, but in the unrated version you'll then see her lying expressionless on the ground.  Also, blood flies out of Drew Barrymore's mouth in one scene.  On his commentary track, director McG discusses inside jokes, visual effects, and shots that didn't quite work for him.  Like a TV sportscaster, he uses a telestrator, but only to occasionally circle items of interest or draw arrows.  There's also an amusing commentary track by the three writers, who chuckle over inside jokes and discuss how the film was changed from the original script.  They preface their comments with: \"I guess they asked us to do this just to prove that writers worked on this movie.\"  \"Who are we kidding?  Who's listening to this right now?\"If you want still more info, there's a trivia track with pop-up factoids with occasional links to more featurettes, a jukebox that offers clips of 11 songs and explanations of why they were picked, a cameo-graphy that offers clips of 13 personalities and why we should know them, and eight 4- to 18-minute featurettes exploring such topics as stunts, vehicles, costumes, and the Pussycat Dolls dance troupe.  And in the next evolution of product placement, the DVD-ROM \"Shop the Scene\" feature allows you to search for a character's outfit or gadget then buy it online.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002A5EBMQ", "B00164EAGY", "B00003CXZ1", "B00AEFYGBA", "B000069HYG", "B0000SX9N2", "B00005JL8Z", "B00004ZDO9", "B008H6GHII", "B000UDGOC0", "B007AFC0RY", "B0006L0LOS", "B000085EFK", "B0007P0Y7C", "B00003CXMP", "B00024JC4E", "B00016MSV2", "B0007PLLBU", "B001C5LLQ4", "B00005MEVO", "B000BKJ758", "B000MX7V70", "B000035Z3G", "B002GHHHL0", "B000LC3ICE", "B000FDFSH2", "B0006GANPA", "B000Y11BC6", "B000AP04FG", "B00026ZG10", "B0041KKYGU", "B00005JMUA", "0767819640", "B0018PH3KQ", "B00008G7UI", "B00BLN4V0A", "B002GOAH1A", "B00006HAWN", "B0001BS3IE", "B0009RCPUW", "B002ZG984Q", "B001EDVNNU", "B000VI70QS", "B004LWZW2O", "B000A343RI", "B0006FO8E8", "B000EGDB10", "B000RW3VCU", "B00005JN4H", "B00BTYMPUY", "B00005J761", "B000CEXGAU", "B005TK0MFE", "B0041ONFOE", "B000VG66XS", "B00ID8H98C", "B00007AJF5", "B00AEFXO8Q", "B0009W5JR8", "B008JFURII", "B00001PE4D", "B000M7FOO8", "B004P7CN7W", "B0000DZ6N3", "B00005JM5B", "B00007GZRP", "B000ARXF96", "B0018CNNV2", "B000CCW2P2", "B0009KA2OA", "B002O3Z4ZW", "B00006G8JD", "B0008FXT1Y", "B0000524E5", "B002GSXKOW", "B00005JM55", "B003Q6D2B4", "B005CFBYW6", "B00008WJD6", "B000ENC5YW", "B003FCKI3O", "B005Z9MFRC", "B00004STVN", "B00005JG6N", "B00E1HIXEI", "B0007OCG56", "B00005JMEW", "B000BTIU4S", "B00008WJEZ", "B000NIBURQ", "B000EQ5V8G", "B0001Z37HM", "B003PIUINS", "B00005JMW7", "B00196UTEG", "B000A2IPQY", "B004SIP6VI", "B00005JLZW", "B00005JNTU", "B00AEFXCLU"], "bought_together": ["B002A5EBMQ", "B00AEFYGBA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002A5EBMQ", "B0000CABE5", "B000069HYG", "B008JFUUIA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 26650}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.9, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B00005JLYW", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51L5TYVcBmL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle (Unrated Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "The Quiet Americanproves that elegant and intelligent filmmaking can be emotionally powerful. Michael Caine plays Thomas Fowler, a British journalist in 1950s Vietnam with a lovely Vietnamese mistress named Phuong  (Do Thi Hai Yen) and a jaded view of the political strife teeming around him. He befriends a seemingly innocuous American named Alden Pyle (Brendan Fraser), who falls in love with Phuong--and slowly, Pyle's real purpose in  Vietnam becomes revealed. Fowler finds that, to hold on to the carefully balanced life he's created for himself, he must make choices he's long avoided. Caine and Fraser are both superb and give a human face to complicated politics; as a result,The Quiet Americanmanages to be  compelling as both history and a story about very specific people embroiled in a very personal conflict.

{"description": "Barry Levinson directed this comedy in which success has a rather surprising effect on two old buddies. Nick Vanderpark (Jack Black) and Tim Dingman (Ben Stiller) are best friends and next-door neighbors who work together at a sandpaper factory. Nick and Tim often find themselves wishing for something more from life, and Nick has a habit of dreaming up harebrained get-rich-quick schemes that usually end in disaster. Tim is particularly appalled by Nick's latest idea, \"Vapoorizer,\" a cleaning product which will make pet feces magically disappear, but to their shock, it turns out to be an incredible success, and before long Nick is wealthy beyond his wildest dreams. Tim, however, is still the same guy getting by in suburbia he's always been, and soon Tim finds himself bitterly resentful of his old friend. As Nick gets richer, Tim gets angrier, and he develops a drinking problem. One night, in a bar, Tim meets an eccentric drifter (Christopher Walken) who offers him some not-so-friendly advice on getting even with his old friend.

Only Spooner suspects that the robots that provide the near future with menial labor are going to turn on mankind--he's just not sure how. When a leading roboticist dies suspiciously, Spooner pursues a trail that may prove his suspicions. Don't expect much of a connection to Isaac Asimov's classic science fiction stories;I, Robot, the action movie, isn't prepared for any ruminations on the significance of artificial intelligence. This likable, efficient movie won't break any new ground, but it does have an idea or two to accompany its jolts and thrills, which puts it ahead of most recent action flicks.

{"description": "Despite super effects, a huge budget, and the cinematic pedigree of alien-happy Steven Spielberg, this take on H.G. Wells's novel is basically a horror film packaged as a sci-fi thrill ride. Instead of a mad slasher, however, Spielberg (along with writers Josh Friedman & David Koepp) utilizes aliens hell-bent on quickly destroying humanity, and the terrifying results that prey upon adult fears, especially in the post-9/11 world. The realistic results could be a new genre, the grim popcorn thriller; often you feel like you're watching Schindler's List more than Spielberg's other thrill-machine movies (Jaws,Jurassic Park). The film centers on Ray Ferrier, a divorced father (Tom Cruise, oh so comfortable) who witnesses one giant craft destroy his New Jersey town and soon is on the road with his teen son (Justin Chatwin) and preteen daughter (Dakota Fanning) in tow, trying to keep ahead of the invasion. The film is, of course, impeccably designed and produced by Spielberg's usual crew of A-class talent. The aliens are genuinely scary, even when the film--like the novel--spends a good chunk of time in a basement. Readers of the book (or viewers of the deft 1953 adaptation) will note the variation of whom and how the aliens come to Earth, which poses some logistical problems. The film opens and closes with narration from the novel read by Morgan Freeman, but Spielberg could have adapted Orson Welles's words from the famous Halloween Eve 1938 radio broadcast: \"We couldn't soap all your windows and steal all your garden gates by tomorrow night, so we did the best next thing: we annihilated the world.\"--Doug ThomasWar of the Worldsat Amazon.comThe SoundtrackThe War of the Worlds(1953)War of the Worlds - The Complete First Season(TV series)Classic Sci-Fi Movies and Their RemakesAliens Invade on DVDThe Prog-rock Opera (no kidding)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEBB8VK", "B00005JL78", "B001SGEUYW", "B00008G8M4", "B00005JL3T", "B0013FDM7E", "B00AEFXNLY", "B00005JMXX", "B001OQCV2E", "B000VECAD0", "B002O3Z510", "B0002V7OI8", "B000H30B2C", "B000EGDB10", "B00005JN2Z", "B005LAIIMG", "B005PTYP70", "B002O3Z50G", "B0002V7ON8", "B00005JN0T", "B00K2CHW48", "B002SJIO4A", "0783225547", "B008JFUO36", "B00005JKLZ", "B00AS1Q93S", "1936594056", "B004EPYZUS", "B001TUZG4K", "B00AEFXR1K", "B00001ZWUS", "B00AEFXYJA", "0767817478", "B0034G4ORC", "B003QO8TOQ", "B00070FX5U", "B0045HCJSA", "B00000G3PA", "B005LAIHPE", "B003Y5H5GK", "B00AEBBA72", "B00003CWU3", "B00I9TDMRM", "B001ECDVKE", "B00003CXXP", "B000V4UFZK", "B0010X73ZG", "B001DZOC6Y", "B00005JKFR", "B000XT1P4S", "B003HKN52U", "B0009PW4D2", "B000HRMAPE", "B004EPYZPS", "B0018QPPXW", "B0002WZTOI", "B00AEBB9LO", "B004LWZW4M", "B003ABZHAO", "B003YJFALS", "B0087ZG7HK", "B000OT6V64", "B004P7CN7W", "B000CCBC9O", "B00000ILDD", "0767803434", "B001L57ZYM", "B000065V3G", "B007STBUHI", "B002ZG980U", "B008JFUQZ2", "B00005B6JZ", "B0006GANOQ", "B000F1IQN2", "1494343576", "B001GCUO02", "B00004Y87O", "0783226810", "B004EPYZSK", "B000P0J0BU", "B005LAIHXQ", "B001680M26", "B000EQHXN2", "B0045HCJFS", "B00004BZIY", "B00008G8M5", "B00003CXQA", "B008JFUS0U", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00EIN6KJ0", "B0000DZ6N3", "B000MV8A9A", "B00005JKYX", "B0000YEEGM", "B000TGJ8CQ", "B0013FCWUW", "B002ZG9864", "B00003CWTI", "B008MIMWQW", "B00IKM5OCO"], "bought_together": ["B00AEBB8VK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AEBB8VK", "B004LWZW4M", "B00005JL78", "B004EPYZSK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 18739}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.95, "brand": "Dreamworks Skg", "asin": "B00005JNTI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51upxzPRnXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "War of the Worlds"}
{"description": "With the slimmest extras package for a Pixar film debuting on DVD,Carsstill shines for home viewing. As with earlier digital-to-digital transfers, the film sounds and looks stunning. There is only one behind-the-scenes feature, a 16-minute cursory but entertaining glance at director John Lasseter's influences (his dad was a car-parts manager), including some of the real-life inspiration for the film such as Michael Wallis's influential book on Route 66 (he also voiced the sheriff). There's a new cartoon for the DVD, \"Mater and Ghost Light,\" which is smile-inducing at best. Four deleted scenes (in storybook format with voices) also show a darker tone the movie may have taken at one point. Best is the adorable short \"One Man Band\" that showed theatrically with the film, and the film's credit sequence can be seen full screen without the credits (and find the Easter egg for an extended version).

{"description": "Movies don't come any bigger than Peter Jackson'sKing Kong, a three-hour remake of the 1933 classic that marries breathtaking visual prowess with a surprising emotional depth. Expanding on the original story of the blonde beauty and the beast who falls for her, Jackson creates a movie spectacle that matches hisLord of the Ringsfilms and even at times evokes their fantasy world while celebrating the glory of '30s Hollywood. Naomi Watts stars as Ann Darrow, a vaudeville actress down on her luck in Depression-era New York until manic filmmaker Carl Denham (a game but miscast Jack Black) entices her with a lead role. Dazzled by the genius of screenwriter Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody), Ann boards the tramp steamer S.S.Venture, which she--and most of the wary crew--believes is headed for Singapore. Denham, however, is in search of the mythic Skull Island, hoping to capture its wonders on film and make a fortune. What he didn't count on were some scary natives who find that the comely Darrow looks like prime sacrifice material for a mysterious giant creature....There's no point in rehashing the entire plot, as every movie aficionado is more than familiar with the trajectory ofKing Kong; the challenge facing Jackson, his screenwriters, and the phenomenal visual-effects team was to breathe new life into an old, familiar story. To that degree, they achieve what could be best called a qualified success. Though they've assembled a crackerjack supporting cast, including Thomas Kretschmann as theVenture's hard-bitten captain and young Jamie Bell as a plucky crewman, the first third of the movie is rather labored, with too much minute detail given over to sumptuous re-creations of '30s New York and the unexciting initial leg of theVenture's sea voyage. However, once the film finds its way to Skull Island (which bears more than a passing resemblance toLOTR's Mordor),Kongturns into a dazzling movie triumph, by turns terrifying and awe-inspiring. The choreography and execution of the action set pieces--including one involving Kong and a trio of Tyrannosaurus Rexes, as well as another that could be charitably described as a bug-phobic's nightmare--is nothing short of landmark filmmaking, and a certain Mr. Spielberg should watch his back, asKongtrumps most anything that has come before it.Despite the visual challenges ofKing Kong, the movie's most difficult hurdle is the budding romance between Ann and her simian soulmate. Happily, this is where Jackson unqualifiedly triumphs, as this unorthodox love story is tenderly and humorously drawn, by turns sympathetic and wondrous. Watts, whose accessibility balances out her almost otherworldly loveliness, works wonders with mere glances, and Andy Serkis, who digitally embodies Kong here much as he did Gollum in theLOTRfilms, breathes vibrant life into the giant star of the film without ever overplaying any emotions. The final, tragic act of the film, set mostly atop the Empire State Building, is whereKongearns its place in movie history as a work that celebrates both the technical and emotional heights that film can reach.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"bought_together": ["B000EHQTZO", "B00AEFYEU8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000EHQTZO", "B00AEFYEU8", "B0087ZG7HK", "0767817478"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 32487}, "categories": [["Movies & TV"]], "price": 8.94, "brand": "Universal Studios", "asin": "B00005JO20", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/513Y54TGdwL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "King Kong (Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "More than a few critics hailedSpider-Man 2as \"the best superhero movie ever,\" and there's no compelling reason to argue--thanks to a bigger budget, better special effects, and a dynamic, character-driven plot, it's a notch aboveSpider-Manin terms of emotional depth and rich comic-book sensibility.Ordinary PeopleOscar-winner Alvin Sargent received screenplay credit, and celebrated author and comic-book expert Michael Chabon worked on the story, but it's director Sam Raimi's affinity for the material that bringsSpidey 2to vivid life. When a fusion experiment goes terribly wrong, a brilliant physicist (Alfred Molina) is turned into Spidey's newest nemesis, the deranged, mechanically tentacled \"Doctor Octopus,\" obsessed with completing his experiment and killing Spider-Man (Tobey Maguire) in the process. Even more compelling is Peter Parker's urgent dilemma: continue his burdensome, lonely life of crime-fighting as Spider-Man, or pursue love and happiness with Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst)? Molina's outstanding as a tragic villain controlled by his own invention, and the action sequences are nothing less than breathtaking, but the real success ofSpider-Man 2is its sense of priorities. With all of Hollywood's biggest and best toys at his disposal, Raimi and his writers stay true to the Marvel mythology, honoringSpider-Mancreators Stan Lee and Steve Ditko, and setting the bar impressively high for the challenge ofSpider-Man 3.--Jeff ShannonDVD Features:The first commentary track is by director Sam Raimi and a self-deprecating Tobey Maguire speaking in tandem, and producer (and Marvel CEO) Avi Arad and coproducer Grant Curtis speaking in tandem. They discuss a number of topics, including Raimi's memory of his excitement over Richard Donner's Superman and how the character of Black Cat had to be dropped from the film. The second commentary is by six members of the Oscar-nominated effects team, and one of their primary focuses is how Doc Ock's arms were achieved by a combination of puppetry and CGI.The centerpiece of the second disc is a massive two-hour documentary that can be viewed all at once or in 12 separate pieces. It covers the development of the story, the visual effects, costumes, stunts, and sound and music. Three shorter featurettes cover Peter Parker's struggle between his personal and hero lives, Doc Ock, and the women in Spider-Man's life, and what's interesting is how they discuss those topics not just in relation to the movies but to the comic books as well. (For example, Betty Brant and Gwen Stacy had a much greater impact in the comics.) There's a scene in which you can toggle among three different camera angles, and a gallery of 17 paintings Alex Ross created for the opening sequence. The sound and picture are spectacular, though only theSuperbit editionhas DTS.--David HoriuchiMore Spiderman on DVDTheSpidermanToy StoreThe First FilmSpider Manon the small screenThe SoundtrackGame Boy AdvanceThe BookMore Superheroes on DVDBatmanBladeThe HulkJimmy NeutronJustice LeagueKim PossibleRobocopSpider-ManSupermanWonder WomanX-MenAlso see our Action & Adventure StoreStills fromSpider-Man 2(click for larger image)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000UR9T8C", "B00005JKCH", "B004LWZWFQ", "B001DHXT20", "B00E5I2MCM", "B00005JNTU", "B000VI70QS", "B001CDR1FG", "B001GCUO1Q", "B000AYELVA", "B00E5I2M6I", "B000AYELVU", "B008JFUO72", "B0083SBMBM", "B004LWZW42", "B004EPZ07K", "B00005JNJV", "B0002IQMAM", "B00E5I2MEK", "B000OVLBF8", "B00E5I2M9K", "B000HEVZ9E", "B008QZ5PY2", "B000HCO83Q", "B00JPS7HOA", "B001QB9H1U", "B00IGVJGYQ", "B0000959N0", "B0007P0Y7C", "B002GSXKN8", "B008JFUPFI", "B000J10EQU", "B0007V6ITE", "B0090SI56Y", "B001GZ6QC4", "6307397594", "B008JFUS0U", "B000IJ79VQ", "B000VR0570", "B002ZG99B8", "B00005JKWJ", "B004LWZWGA", "B005G4TJUC", "B002IPFWTE", "B00005JM5E", "B005LAIGW8", "0767817478", "B000H30B2C", "B002A5EBLW", "B0006L0LOS", "B000U7WV1Y", "B0000VCZLG", "B000P0J06K", "B002GSXKNI", "B002HWRYJE", "B0004Z33EQ", "B0009A409S", "B001DJLD2G", "B000I0RQVI", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B0007RT9MG", "B001GKJ2E8", "B0000AXE8I", "B007K3JFUQ", "B00004STUL", "B00BEZTMFY", "B000P0J06U", "B000957O82", "1402778007", "B0039N74CW", "B003UESJF6", "B00F4FFO8E", "B001HN697M", "B001OST0LW", "B0060FXDCG", "B0049IHX2C", "B000P0J0A6", "B000CEVC9M", "B000UVKGPI", "B009JBWOU0", "B00005JM5B", "B00I6JOD2S", "B001EDVNNU", "B000O77SRC", "B0000633UA", "B000P6XQ50", "B000E8M0VA", "B00008G8M4", "B000EGDB10", "B007REV4T8", "B00BPA2PEI", "B008Y1YK9Y", "B005OY6LBE", "0780624890", "B002935GMS", "0767803434", "6305428042", "B000O78KW4", "B009HIKAN8"], "bought_together": ["B000UR9T8C", "B00005JKCH"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004LWZWFQ", "B003YAR97K", "B00005JKCH", "B000UR9T8C"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 9593}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.0, "brand": "Marvel Kids", "asin": "B00005JMQW", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51529JJX43L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Spider-Man 2 (Widescreen Special Edition)"}

{"description": "While much was made of the fact thatMarie Antoinetteelicited boos at Cannes, the many favorable reviews attracted less attention. Inspired by Antonia Fraser's biography, Sofia Coppola fashions a portrait that's just as dreamy asThe Virgin Suicides, her first literary adaptation, and the Oscar-winningLost in Translation. Set to a soundtrack of post-punk (a conceit that adds more interest than resonance), the teenaged Marie (Kirsten Dunst, quite good) may be shallow, but she's rarely unsympathetic. The story begins in the late-18th century as the Austrian Archduchess agrees to marry Louis-Auguste (Jason Schwartzman). After bidding adieu to her mother, Maria Theresa (Marianne Faithfull), she travels to France, where King Louis XV (Rip Torn) sets the rules--and the list is endless (Judy Davis' Comtesse de Noailles is the primary enforcer). As for the Dauphin, he's just a boy, really, with more interest in his key collection than their marriage bed. Should Marie produce an heir, it might be enough to sustain her--since life is nothing but an endless shopping spree--but clouds gather on the horizon as an impoverished populace rises up against their extravagant leaders. Coppola merely suggests what happens next, although history paints a darker picture. Filmed in and around the Chateau of Versailles,Marie Antoinetteis a riot of rustling gowns, sparkling jewels, and Manolo Blahnik-designed shoes. To say that style trumps substance does its maker a disservice, but the look of the thing does leave the deepest impression.--Kathleen C.

{"description": "Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's Endis a rollicking voyage in the same spirit of the two earlierPiratesfilms, yet far darker in spots (and nearly three hours to boot). The action, largely revolving around a pirate alliance against the ruthless East India Trading Company, doesn't disappoint, though the violence is probably too harsh for young children. Through it all, the plucky cast (Keira Knightley, Orlando Bloom, Geoffrey Rush) are buffeted by battle, maelstroms, betrayal, treachery, a ferocious Caribbean weather goddess, and that gnarly voyage back from the world's end--but with their wit intact. As always, Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow tosses off great lines ; he chastises \"a woman scorned, like which hell hath no fury than!\" He insults an opponent with a string of epithets, ending in \"yeasty codpiece.\"!In the previousThe Curse of the Black Pearl, Sparrow was killed--sent to Davy Jones' Locker. In the opening scenes, the viewer sees that death has  not been kind to Sparrow--but that's not to say he hasn't found endless ways to amuse himself, cavorting with dozens of hallucinated versions of himself on the deck of the Black Pearl. But Sparrow is needed in this world, so a daring rescue brings him back. Keith Richards' much ballyhooed appearance as Jack's dad is little more than a cameo, though he does play a wistful guitar. But the action, as always, is more than satisfying, held together by Depp, who, outsmarting the far-better-armed British yet again, causes a bewigged commander to muse: \"Do you think he plans it all out, or just makes it up as he goes along?\" As far as fans are concerned, it matters not.--A.T. HurleyOn the DVDHere's something you can't say about just any DVD extras: There appears to bemoreof Keith Richards in the outtakes, interviews, and other special features on theAt World's Enddisc than in the actual film. For those scenes alone, this special edition is well worth the price. Richards looks as woozy and gamey as all the rumors suggested, and answers questions he's not asked, with Johnny Depp sitting next to him, almost acting as a translator. Richards offers pithy comments like, \"Everything I do is original, you better believe,\" and smiles when other cast members call him \"Two-Take Richards\" for supposedly nailing his scenes.The packed second disc also includes a terrific mini-doc on how the filmmakers created the famous maelstrom, in an enormous hanger in Palmdale, California, with the ships floating 30 feet off the ground. \"Just moving theBlack Pearlwas an enormous undertaking,\" says producer Jerry Bruckheimer with serious understatement. Other cool extras include \"Tale of the Many Jacks,\" deleted scenes with great commentary, \"The World of Chow Yun-Fat,\" a bio of composer Hans Zimmer, features on the set designers, a look at the impressive Brethren Court, and some hilarious bloopers. \"You can't curse in a Disney film,\" deadpans Depp when a costar blurts out something blue. \"See? I told him.\" The extras are truly as much of a rollicking adventure as the film.--A.T.

{"description": "Nearly 20 years after riding his last Crusade, Harrison Ford makes a welcome return as archaeologist/relic hunter Indiana Jones inIndiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, an action-packed fourth installment that's, in a nutshell, less memorable than the first three but great nostalgia for fans of the series. Producer George Lucas and screenwriter David Koepp (War of the Worlds) set the film during the cold war, as the Soviets--replacing Nazis as Indy's villains of choice and led by a sword-wielding Cate Blanchett with black bob and sunglasses--are in pursuit of a crystal skull, which has mystical powers related to a city of gold. After escaping from them in a spectacular opening action sequence, Indy is coerced to head to Peru at the behest of a young greaser (Shia LaBeouf) whose friend--and Indy's colleague--Professor Oxley (John Hurt) has been captured for his knowledge of the skull's whereabouts. Whatever secrets the skull holds are tertiary; its reveal is the weakest part of the movie, as the CGI effects that inevitably accompany it feel jarring next to the boulder-rolling world of Indy audiences knew and loved. There's plenty of comedy, delightful stunts--ants play a deadly role here--and the return ofRaiderslove interest Karen Allen as Marion Ravenwood, once shrill but now softened, giving her ex-love bemused glances and eye-rolls as he huffs his way to save the day. Which brings us to Ford: bullwhip still in hand, he's a little creakier, a lot grayer, but still twice the action hero of anyone in film today. With all the anticipation and hype leading up to the film's release, perhaps no reunion is sweeter than that of Ford with the role that fits him as snugly as that fedora hat.--Ellen A.

{"description": "Jennifer Garner's lips grow more Angelina-esque every year. In the romantic comedyCatch and Release, Garner (Alias, 13 Going On 30) plays Gray Wheeler, a young woman whose fiance dies unexpectedly before the wedding, leaving Gray unable to afford her home--so she moves in with her fiance's best friends, Sam (Kevin Smith, director ofClerksandDogma) and Dennis (Sam Jaeger,Lucky Number Slevin). But the presence of another old friend named Fritz (Timothy Olyphant,Deadwood) leads to the unveiling of a secret: Gray's fiance had a child with another woman.Catch and Releaselacks the clear story structure that most romantic comedies are built on, but trades it for a richer sense of the ambiguities of human relationships. Garner, though lovely and personable, is a bit bland--fortunately, she's surrounded by actors with all kinds of edges, including Smith (who shows an unexpected and uncloying earnest side), Fiona Shaw (from theHarry Pottermovies) as the fiance's grieving mother, and Juliette Lewis (Cape Fear), who demonstrates once again her powers as a fearless and surprising actress.Catch and Releaseis an uneven movie, with a remarkably elegant visual style that sometimes clashes with the workmanlike dialogue, but it can't be written off as the same old Hollywood claptrap. Though a happy ending is inevitable, the path it takes has some surprising turns and flashes of unexpected emotional depth.--Bret FetzerStills fromCatch and Release(click for larger image)BeyondCatch and Releaseon Amazon.comMore Films from Jennifer GarnerCD SoundtrackMore Romantic Comedies", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0038N9X3Q", "B002UJIY7A", "B000K2V7E6", "B000MQC9H4", "B00K2CHSS8", "B004SIP9RO", "B000N6U0E2", "B00316DDUO", "B004EPZ070", "B0012RLX88", "B003L20IG0", "B002ZG988M", "B002ZG989G", "B0009OL7Z4", "B000LPR5CA", "B001OQCUZM", "B00164KYV4", "B0000560PU", "B003B3V0N4", "B00KNALRZ4", "B00866JL96", "B004EPYZP8", "B00JA3RVG4", "B00005PJ7G", "B003Y5H574", "B0021L8UXA", "6304765266", "B00H9LHVHI", "B00AKGG6JS", "B00005JPSM", "B000P0J08S", "B004LWZW9C", "B003EYVXXC", "B002K0WBXW", "B002ZG99UE", "B00H7LJ2UO", "B00AEFYQE2", "B00K2CHUWW", "B004SBQAN8", "B000ZS8GW6", "B000HEWEE4", "B002P413IC", "B00006ZXSO", "B00AEFY99O", "B000EMGJ7C", "B005LAIGSM", "B003BV8ICC", "B000YABYLA", "B004SIP8JI", "B000YAA68C", "B00007E2F5", "B0038N9WKU", "B001HN69C2", "B00E8RKHWW", "B00FZ4KR4U", "B004EPZ0BG", "B005LAIGRS", "B00005JN3W", "B0021L8V3Y", "B00GUO2SKA", "B000CEV3KU", "B0000VD02Y", "B00008G7UF", "B00HLTD3ZW", "B00IVLRA62", "B000023VTP", "0767810856", "B0004Z3242", "B0009UZGIM", "B00C1LIYWM", "B005LAIGXW", "B001WAKOW6", "B00118T632", "B00B5J6A7W", "B008JFUNKU", "B005LAIIKS", "B004IK30PA", "B0006A9FIM", "B004SIP8LG", "B0038M2APA", "B004BFTFBU", "B00J11U54K", "B002ZG9968", "B00005JNP4", "B00AIBZMD6", "B00006ZXSN", "B0007P0Y7C", "B0021L8UO4", "B0038RSJB4", "B00GEKO51U", "B00AEBB8NS", "B00F8PTALC", "B000683VI4", "B00008NRI7", "B002OVED88", "B0007IO6NM", "B0045HCJJ4", "B000J3OTSM", "B000E6EHE0", "B00IGBI052"], "bought_together": ["B0038N9X3Q"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003L20IG0", "B004EPYZP8", "B00GPWEPZ8", "B002UJIY7A"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 20294}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.98, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B00005JPF3", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51%2B7mjxLmdL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Catch and Release"}

{"description": "There's only one better way to experience these performances by Bruce  Springsteen and his reunited E Street Band, and that's if you were actually in  Madison Square Garden when they were recorded in June and July 2000. This two-disc set includes more than three hours of music. Disc One features the 14 songs  that were aired by HBO in 2001, while Disc Two adds another 11 tunes released  here for the first time. The Boss and his band are in top form; their sheer  exuberance at playing together, not to mention the joy and inspiration they  provide their audience, are palpable, thanks in no small part to the excellent  direction and superb sound (Dolby Digital 5.1 or PCM stereo). Highlights? Almost  everything, from timeless anthems like \"Born to Run\" and \"Thunder Road\" to the  riveting \"American Skin (41 Shots)\" and a bluesy, solo \"Born in the U.S.A.\" All  together now: Bruuuuuuce!--Sam Graham", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00013F35I", "B003ICWTR4", "B000056HOZ", "B000654YVU", "B00005AFVR", "B000056HP0", "B008VR7TX0", "B003ICWTTM", "B000P12LX8", "B000AMWJ16", "B000BJS4OY", "B00F1W1S26", "B00GUXO12O", "B000002AJO", "B00IBQ5LMW", "B004J88SGC", "B000V8I2QU", "B000P1KTW8", "630463949X", "B000069HKH", "B0000584ZV", "B00IBQ5NIO", "B0018M6J72", "B00F1W1SGM", "B00005RIIP", "B0000E1ALR", "B0012GMWCA", "B000FGG738", "B006ZCWU5K", "B004J713JW", "B003O5MOES", "B0000DG7C0", "B000GG4XJM", "B00000DHTF", "B00005QBZD", "B00000255F", "B0018AK9NO", "B0007WF1WS", "B004R0MF20", "B000E97X66", "B0000025D0", "B001LF4IA6", "B003VRV9FY", "B0040JHWKS", "B008DVJOYG", "B0040JHXTI", "B0000025T6", "1439191824", "B000F48D00", "B0012GMUJA", "B0000TB05A", "B00008PX8P", "B004USUP12", "B0050JN8BE", "B000654YRY", "B00092ZMDY", "B0000025KI", "B000002B30", "B0000UQQTE", "B008NR92SI", "B0007Y89ZM", "B003ZVU1P0", "B0000025UW", "B0050JN7Z6", "B0012GN0Z8", "B004D2GMR6", "B00023P4B0", "B0000TGADW", "B0012GMVD0", "B00023B1A8", "B0053TWVFA", "B009M6T3KQ", "B000002513", "B000022TT6", "6305019681", "B000FUTUYC", "B003C1SPX8", "B008B3MZMY", "B0030BOCKU", "B000PGTPE6", "B00JOWHTTA", "B004FRVE18", "B0001MDQ44", "B000UZD4AS", "B005OGYH9U", "B001XJEKGC", "B005SDDB9Q", "B002HWUU3G", "B00064AEOC", "B008DVJNL0", "B000GIWHCU", "B00DX88FPS", "B0030BOCE6", "1423819500", "B00064VR0W", "B003XMKMZU", "B00068C7VQ", "B00HQI823Q", "B00IR1V09O", "B0007QS2ES"], "bought_together": ["B00013F35I", "B000056HOZ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003ICWTR4", "B00005AFVR", "B000056HOZ", "B000P12LX8"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 13730}, "categories": [["CDs & Vinyl", "Pop", "Singer-Songwriters"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Pop", "Vocal Pop"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Rock"], ["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 19.99, "brand": "SPRINGSTEEN,BRUCE &amp; E STREET BAND", "asin": "B00005R23S", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51TP0RDYPRL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Bruce Springsteen &amp; the E Street Band - Live in New York City"}

{"description": "Innocuous, innocent, and somewhat idiotic, Disney's bubbleheaded road-movie comedy plays as a farcical remake of the 1976 cult TV-movie melodramaThe Boy in the Plastic Bubble. Jake Gyllenhaal is the goodhearted innocent raised in a sort of human Habitrail of plastic rooms and rubber tunnels. To win back the girl of his dreams (Marley Shelton), he steps out of his indoor greenhouse and into a homemade Ziplock bubble suit. It's the usual story: naive innocent bounces down the highway like a beach ball with legs and wins over the wacky supporting cast of soft-hearted bikers, zombielike teenage cultists, and orphaned \"freaks\" through purity and pluck. The premise wears thin after a while, but Gyllenhaal keeps the film bounding along with goofy innocence and energetic eagerness. Swoosie Kurtz costars as his religious-zealot clinging mom.

{"description": "The Hearseis an example of a horror movie subgenre: the demon-possessed vehicle. When Jane Hardy inherits her late aunt's home, she faces just such a vehicle in the form of a vintage hearse. Tormented by the car and harassed by mysterious townsfolk, Jane has to unlock her aunt's hidden secrets or perish. Part of the suspense comes from wondering if Jane is being tormented by the supernatural, her fragile emotional state, or someone just trying to scare Jane off her property.Possessed-car suspensers can be surprisingly effective and frightening. Unfortunately, this movie is a fairly low-budget effort, offering up many standard suspense techniques that were pretty shopworn even in 1980. The end result is a film that is predictable, and has few if any real chills. Notable only as one of Joseph Cotten's last films.--Mark Savary", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0013527K2", "B005GPFZEK", "B006OT0T6G", "B000063UR5", "B003JIPN20", "B0009UC80G", "B002I41KSM", "6305487790", "B00008V6YB"], "bought_together": ["B006OT0T6G"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B007S9XXFU", "B00I095ILO", "B0013527K2", "B000063UR5"]}, "price": 56.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 144558}, "asin": "B00005YUP7", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/519YD72Z8DL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Hearse"}

{"description": "Mikhail Kalatozov's luscious portrait of love and loss during World War II stars almond-eyed beauty Tatyana Samojlova and handsome Aleksei Batalov as moony-eyed young lovers whose innocent romance is shattered by war. When the idealistic boy volunteers for service, his draft-dodging cousin steals the despondent girl by brute force, yet she never gives up on her true love, even when he's reported dead. Kalatozov's patriotic paean to fallen soldiers and home-front heroes is an undeniably sentimental melodrama suffused with lush images and lyrical sequences, a kind of cinematic poetry unseen in Soviet cinema since the experimentation and optimism of the silent days. Produced during the \"thaw\" following Stalin's repressive reign, it won the Palme d'Or prize at the 1958 Cannes Film Festival and set Kalatozov on the road to more ambitious expressions of Soviet idealism in the modern world, culminating in his masterpiece,I Am Cuba.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000633SB", "B00019G4TQ", "B006ML50YC", "B000UJ48Q8", "B000K2UEDG", "B0002KQOH6", "B006ML50S8", "B0000BWVCR", "6305257450", "B00280QNK6", "B000LV6OHQ", "6305744114", "B000V7HFL4", "B0019X3ZZO", "B00006JO77", "B00008ZZ9M", "B000I8OOHE", "B000RTCSIQ", "B000I8OOG0", "B000PKG6OO", "B00009MEKP", "B0000714AW", "B009RWRIMA", "B00092ZLEY", "B004NWPY20", "B00GA9F2PI", "B000093NR0", "B00005UQ7R", "B00005NFZB", "B000BB14I0", "B003VWR1XI", "B00006IUJ1", "B00005UQ7Q", "B004VH65A2", "B0000A02TX", "B00B2BYXWM", "B00HVOFP6W", "0780022343", "B000KRNGNQ", "B00F98FNNM", "B002U6DVQ2", "B0019T0JAW", "B000K0YLX2", "B00005JLV7", "B0000DGKI7", "B00004XQN5", "B001BEK8CE", "B003OXGW5M", "B00005M2C7", "B00B2BYXYA", "B00006LPEK", "B001MPS7GG", "6305131104", "B00F98FOFY", "B000093NR1", "B00HRISNPM", "B0000YEDM2", "B0002DB4YQ", "B00005QAPJ", "B004GNBBVO", "B004XVMCLC", "B000LTTOOS", "B00026L7MC", "0780020707", "B00005BHW6", "B0007989ZW", "B00A8QDHYW", "B0009UC7SE", "B006X96PBU", "0780023307", "B0011U3OA6", "B00HVOFP9O", "B0000714AX", "B001LMU19G", "B00003CXUM", "B00BY8U54S", "B00KE3B9US", "B00004W3HG", "B004WPYO7E", "B00007CVS3", "B00GPPXNLC", "B00009NHAT", "B000EANSXM", "B00B2BYXSQ", "B00IGK6TOM", "B00BX49B6G", "B00AQ6J3AG", "B000E5LEVA", "B005HK13S6", "B00DZP1BUU", "B00004Z1FM", "B004NWPY34", "B00393SFU2", "B00BX49BZM", "B001CW7ZSU", "0780021541", "B001TIQT7A", "B00005UQ7T", "B0087OULO6", "B005152CB4"], "bought_together": ["B0000633SB", "B00019G4TQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00019G4TQ", "B006ML50YC", "B000UJ48Q8", "B0000633SB"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 109238}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 24.86, "brand": "SAMOILOVA,TATIANA", "asin": "B0000633SD", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41J3BK4357L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Cranes are Flying (The Criterion Collection)"}

{"description": "Fast paced, violent, and loud,Sprigganuses a combination of drawn and computer animation to deliver the kind of slam-bang thrill rideFinal Fantasyonly promised. The convoluted plot, based on amangaseries by Hirotsugu Kawasaki and Yasutaka Ito, mixes elements fromRaiders of the Lost Ark,2001: A Space Odyssey,Akira, andUniversal Soldier. Yu Ominae (voice by Christopher Patton) is a Spriggan, a member of an elite corps of biologically engineered warriors created by the secret organization ARCAM, who finds himself involved in a baroque adventure centered on the newly discovered Ark of Noah. The Ark is actually an extraterrestrial vehicle with the power to alter the Earth's climate and spawn new animal species. A sinister cadre of rogue Pentagon generals wants it and dispatches a corps of murderous cyborgs lead by Col. MacDougall (Kevin Corn), a monstrous child who's also the product of biological experiments, to capture it. ARCAM is determined to prevent the generals from gaining control of the Ark's awesome powers. Yu battles his way to victory through car chases, sword fights, shootouts, explosions, knifings, and psychic blasts, with a little help from fellow-Spriggan Jean-Jacques Mondo (Andy McAvin). Director Hirotsugu Kawasaki handles the action sequences more effectively than the minimal character development, and Katsuhiro Otomo's screenplay doesn't always make a lot of sense. ButSpriggansupplies what hard-core action fans sought in vain in many recent Hollywood blockbusters. Just don't sit too close to a speaker.

{"description": "Retelling a story that has made it onto the silver screen more than most, this latest adaptation of The Count of Monte Cristo makes yet another swashbuckling attempt to win over a new generation of cinema goers. A dashing James Caviezel takes the role of the Count, who is driven by a desire for revenge after being betrayed by his best friend Fernand (played by a dishevelled Guy Pearce) and landed with 16 years of solitary confinement in Chateau D'If, a damp cavernous prison. Thus the scene is set for a good old-fashioned romp. The trouble with this \"re-imagining\" (to borrow a phrase from Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes) is that it's never quite sure whether to take itself seriously or not. Alexandre Dumas's original story is a traditionally melodramatic tale of deceit and double-crossing, with clear-cut bad guys and a moral lesson to be learned at the end. Here, director Kevin Reynolds appears unsure about whether to stick with tradition or bring the story up to date and turn it into a post-modern play on the old Victorian values and style. When the Count and his heavy-breathing loved one are reunited, their kiss is actually framed as a cameo. Both lead actors are also prone to heavy bouts of overacting, garnishing their performances with exaggerated baroque gestures. Clearly this is a film in which the actors could over-indulge themselves and (almost) get away with it, were it not for the fact that--bar Richard Harris as the \"Priest\"--none of them seem to have the faintest idea about how to conduct themselves in a period drama. This Count of Monte Cristo will leave the audience a little confused as to whether they should cry along with the story or laugh along with the actors. --Nikki Disney On the DVD: The Count of Monte Cristo on disc offers no escape from the dry drawl of director Kevin Reynolds, who features in almost every element of the extensive extras package.

{"description": "From the director of Arlington Road comes a spine-tingling, super-natural thriller based on actual events that will rattle your nerves and shake your beliefs. Distraught by the sudden, tragic death of his wife (Debra Messing), John Klein (Richard Gere), a journalist for The Washington Post, finds himself mysteriously drawn to a small West Virginia town when his car inexplicably strands him. Rescued by the sympathetic but skeptical local police sergeant (Laura Linney), he soon learns that many of the town's residents have been beset by bizarre events, including sightings of an eerie \"moth-like\" entity, similar to the one seen by his late wife. Investigating further and having his own terrifying encounters with the creature, he becomes obsessed with the idea that this supernatural being canpredict impending calamities and is trying to warn the town of one. Is this a psychic delusion brought on by his grief or can he convince the police sergeant that there's a tragedy that must be averted", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JKZH", "B004BVS2C2", "0765334984", "B00AEBBA2W", "B003102JDC", "B00005JNNT", "B005FUTBSC", "B0002DB54A", "0765341972", "B004SIP92O", "B00ECW9UJY", "B00005JNY3", "B00AEFYC96", "B00L9K2EGS", "B00LBFFR2Y", "B00AEFYYH6", "B0013D8LCC", "6305310335", "B00005JL3T", "0966724674", "6305308837", "B00K2CHW48", "B003DQIPVO", "079074208X", "B000YNFXZA", "B009NZXH5S", "B0001Z52RU", "B00004BZIY", "B00006RCNY", "B00LG6XHDY", "B004B3PBFQ", "B000WMFZN8", "B0006IIKQW", "B0058ZPNUE", "B000TJ6PBK", "B00K2CHWYI", "B000068IEX", "1938398033", "0783240295", "0783116926", "B00BEIYMAG", "B000056T5E", "B00005RHGK", "B00064LJVE", "B005NKIPUY", "B0006HBZXS", "B00K2CHVSK", "B00008EY9G", "B001BRZ5J2", "B00006AUJR", "B000LP6KNU", "B002VWNICC", "6305213305", "6304883773", "B00AEFXW8I", "B0006SGYL0", "B004SIP6WW", "B000V4UFZK", "B000BTJDGC", "B003LR5BD0", "B00151QYOO", "B002AT8KAG", "B0007NFLO0", "0792835727", "B002GHHHN8", "0767817737", "0800177789", "B002O5M4T4", "B00BTYIHS8", "B0045HCJRQ", "B00000JGHL", "B00DZP1C2W", "B00015YVDG", "0792844807", "B00005O5AX", "6305657947", "630542845X", "B002LMSWN2", "B00005UWLB", "B00003L9CQ", "193839819X", "B004LWZW24", "6305718954", "B00BNAE14W", "B00B96TGQS", "0783226888", "B00008L3S6", "6304765258", "B00AEFY4IA", "B003UGLCIA", "B009XTF8KQ", "B004RA7Y9E", "B00AJLHUA8", "B001KMB6X2", "B000KWZ7JC", "B00111YM5Q", "B0050QNO7K", "B000U7169M", "B00AEFYXJ0"], "bought_together": ["B00005JKZH", "B00AEBBA2W"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005JKZH", "0765341972", "0765334984", "B004SIP92O"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 21120}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.0, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B0000648X0", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41l8S4jyEIL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Mothman Prophecies"}
{"description": "Seething passions, wandering ghosts, and an unexploded bomb fill this beautifully filmed tale of war and suspense. ThoughThe Devil's Backbonewas advertised as a horror movie in the States, it's really more of a drama that happens to have ghosts in it. During the Spanish Civil War, young Carlos is abandoned at a completely isolated orphanage. The tensions therein have been building for years, exacerbated by the unexploded bomb resting menacingly in the courtyard. Bullies scheme, tempers flare, and a ghost that visits Carlos's bed seems to be the key to it all. The movie is full of excellent performances, especially by Marisa Paredes as the gruff-but-kind headmistress, Eduardo Noriega as the handyman with secrets to keep, and Federico Luppi as the benevolent professor who likes to keep deformed fetuses in jars. A rich, satisfying drama with some good, spooky fun thrown in.--Ali Davis", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0015ET3YO", "B000O76ZQC", "B0043VUHV4", "B00006AUIG", "B0028DRGDQ", "B0036TGSJE", "B004XVMCN0", "B00000K3TS", "0783116926", "B000S0GYRU", "B000934FC2", "B003TRMLQM", "B000GSYRY6", "B00080Z53O", "B001F7MSFM", "B0041KKYF6", "B001AK3S4Y", "B0009WFEDC", "B004SIP92O", "B000WSLAUO", "B00005JLQW", "B00005LZOD", "B009VO9XSG", "B000N3T0DW", "B005TK23PQ", "B001MYIXAC", "B005BQTUVI", "B0043VUHUU", "B002VECLXC", "B00125WATQ", "B008WAM2E2", "B006QWC2ZC", "B002LFPBLU", "B001CDLAU8", "B005NHZAMI", "B001MEJY8W", "B0015ET3YY", "B002OVO18A", "B0045NXMJE", "B00005N8A9", "B00AN10NU8", "B00008AOX5", "B007VYEDHO", "B0002TT0MI", "B0018O4YT0", "0062082841", "B00005JL57", "B001FOPOD8", "B004DF3S84", "B00AEFXR8I", "0783228457", "B008G1JIQC", "B0006OJH0E", "B001J710Y8", "B004SUDQDG", "B00BEIYMAG", "B000GB5MOW", "B002P7UCJK", "B003Q6D246", "B002M2T1VI", "B0009X75EC", "B000C8Q900", "B0097C046W", "B002EOVXBK", "B000069I0A", "B0000A2ZTY", "B00GJNQ3S0", "B00005B6L0", "B008S2NABI", "6305228876", "B002IRYYD2", "B004B32500", "B0010X73ZG", "B000BT97AO", "B002FHGESI", "0783225903", "B00AIBZLVY", "B008NNY8XQ", "B00180R06I", "B002M2T1V8", "B00004TS0G", "B004XVMCGW", "B002VRNIZO", "B001D5C1OO", "B001FOK70S", "B002LMSWN2", "B00E5G03KM", "B00003CXCF", "B00004Y87O", "B0024FAG44", "B000FS9FE4", "B00005JNCZ", "B001AIQ154", "B000OYCMLM", "B0087ZG7UW", "B004KDYR20", "B000EOTVU2", "B00006G8G3", "B00CS7PKN0", "B004P2VQZ2"], "bought_together": ["B000O76ZQC", "B0015ET3YO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000O76ZQC", "B0015ET3YO", "B00CEIOH50", "B0043VUHV4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 204451}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 10.19, "brand": "", "asin": "B000066C6I", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514SM59NTNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Devil's Backbone"}

{"description": "Are You Being Served?created a standard for the British sitcom.  When the Ladies' Department of Grace Brothers store is forced to share a  floor with the Men's Department, the stage is set for delightful battles  between men and women, senior and junior staff, and management and  employees. The show was originally conceived as a vehicle for Trevor  Bannister as the irreverent Mr. Lucas, a junior salesman who sardonically  punctures the store's rigid hierarchy; but it soon became clear that  mocking the established order isn't half as funny as taking it very  seriously--with all the delicious pettiness that results. Mincing Mr.  Humphries (the effervescent John Inman) and imperious Mrs. Slocombe (comic  powerhouse Mollie Sugden) swiftly became audience favorites, ably backed  up by snooty, lecherous Capt. Peacock (Frank Thornton), affable Miss  Brahms (Wendy Richard), and curmudgeonly Mr. Grainger (Arthur Brough).  That these talented performers cultivated a engaging comic rapport is no  surprise, but it's constantly amazing that the writers were able, over  dozens of episodes, to find inventive but believable new spins on the  department store scenario, turning security cameras, daffy sales  promotions, and even malfunctioning Christmas decorations into brilliant  comic set-ups. Thelater seriescontinued to be enjoyable even after the  loss of several of the original cast members, but the first five series  (which originally aired from 1972 to 1977) have the perfect balance of  prickly personalities. A gem of a show, well deserving of the reverence of  its rabid fans.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000A02Y7", "B001JV5BBC", "B0002F6BT2", "B002LFPAUC", "B00BIR2A3E"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002I9TZHA", "B0002F6BT2", "B001JV5BBC", "B0000A02YC"]}, "price": 61.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 162795}, "asin": "B000069HXD", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61MD8J3NQCL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Are You Being Served?

{"description": "Extraordinary footage and eloquent narration by David Attenborough highlight the BBC's remarkable wildlife seriesThe Blue Planet: Seas of Life. \"Ocean World\" begins with astonishing views of a gigantic blue whale--the elusive Holy Grail of undersea photography--and the marvels continue to demonstrate the power, diversity, and profound ecological influence of Earth's oceans. \"Frozen Seas\" examines whales, walruses, penguins, and other creatures under the extreme conditions of the Arctic and Antarctic Circles. The next two episodes are even better. \"Open Ocean\" travels thousands of miles into the vast \"liquid desert,\" where currents determine how the ocean's diverse life forms will assume their places in the food chain. More amazing, \"The Deep\" descends with a state-of-the-art submersible to the ocean's abyssal plain and beyond, filming such bizarre creatures as the fangtooth, bioluminescent jellies, transparent squid, the giant-mouthed gulper eel, and the never-before-seen hairy angler fish.\"Seasonal Seas\" focuses on the explosion of life that accompanies every annual blooming of plankton, numbering in the countless billions and captured here with brilliant microphotography. In \"Coral Seas,\" miles-long reefs of living coral are explored, from deep within (requiring brief computer animation) to the surrounding environs, where you'll see white-tipped sharks in a feeding frenzy while beautiful harlequin shrimp wrestle with a starfish. \"Tidal Seas\" explores the myriad life forms that thrive when lunar gravity pulls the oceans offshore. \"Coasts\" is easily the most brutal episode, but no less mesmerizing. The most unexpected, and horrifying, sequence is the orca, earning its \"killer whale\" nickname by capturing, killing, and tail-tossing a seal pup--a sequence so mysteriously primal that even the most seasoned marine biologist will be utterly amazed. One of the finest wildlife programs you're ever likely to see,The Blue Planet: Seas of Lifeprovides the privilege of visiting a truly alien world teeming with the rarest wonders of nature.

{"description": "Toula is 30. And unmarried. Which means as a nice Greek girl -- she's a failure. All her cousins did the right thing -- married Greek boys and made Greek babies. So everyone worries: what will become of Toula? Then one day she sees the ultimate unattainable guy and realizes the only way her life will get better is if he gets away from her big, fat Greek family. Toula escapes from the family restaurant. She exchanges her seating hostess jacket for a college diploma, convinces her aunt to give her a new job, and trades in her coke-bottle glasses for contact lenses, just in time for \"him\" to walk back into her life. Ian Miller is tall, handsome but defnitely not Greek. Their courtship is an Olympian culture clash. Can Ian handle Toula, her parents, her aunts, uncles, cousins and several centuries of Greek heritage? Will Toula discover the love she's been missing right in the heart of her big, fat family? One thing is for sure, for better or worse, for richer or poorer, with Ian's proposal Toula is headed for her big, fat Greek wedding.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0021L8UO4", "B000EHRVOW", "B00386EZKE", "B000ELJAEM", "B0013D8LHC", "B00003CXSM", "B00AEBB8NS", "6304765266", "B0000CGNEF", "B00466HN7M", "B00005JG6N", "B000BKVQS4", "B0007RT9M6", "B0009OL7Z4", "B0038N9X3Q", "6305236569", "B002ZG988M", "B001AKTZW8", "B00006ZXSL", "B000YDBPAM", "B0015I2RT8", "B001TUZD8O", "B0000AOV4I", "B00AEBB8YW", "B000MQC9H4", "B00007E2F5", "B002ZG989G", "B0001AVZA8", "B0000897EG", "B00AEFXYOA", "B004SIP9RO", "B0007PLLBU", "B000OCZA04", "B00008NRI7", "B001GKJ2DY", "B002K0WBXW", "B00008G7UF", "B008R65XMO", "B000A343RI", "B001ECDVK4", "B0000VD02Y", "B000023VTP", "B001Y8DJVE", "B002ZG9968", "B003BV8ICC", "B0001XALGY", "B003B3V0N4", "B00006ZXSO", "B00006ZXSK", "B002U4UYZA", "B002U1LGTQ", "B00005JN3W", "B003Y5H524", "B000GETTIE", "B000J103OI", "B00DW5IJR6", "B00003CXC3", "B00AEFY99O", "B00AEBBA2M", "B001LMAK9W", "B0042816YK", "B006VRRGQ2", "B000JU8H9C", "B004IK30PA", "B00AEFXO8Q", "B005LAIGXW", "B0000B1OFL", "B00158K0QU", "B004SIP9VA", "B00006ZXSQ", "6305428352", "B005Z9MFRC", "B000K7VHTQ", "B000Z8GZYW", "B00AEFY5TI", "0767810856", "B0001I55M4", "B004SIP8LG", "B000FOPPC4", "B000E6EHE0", "B00005JPSM", "0800177258", "6305428387", "6305803781", "B004EPZ070", "0800141849"], "bought_together": ["B00386EZKE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00386EZKE", "B00466HN7M", "B0021L8UO4", "B0009OL7Z4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 2192}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.99, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00006FMUW", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51EhfedTTUL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "My Big Fat Greek Wedding"}

{"description": "The tribulations of Tommy and Dick Smothers and their popular late-'60s television show are detailed in Maureen Muldaur's interesting 92-minute documentary. Viewing the clips fromThe Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour, one might find it hard to imagine that they were considered controversial at the time; indeed, the jabs at censorship, gun ownership, the Vietnam war, and more seem mild by today's raunchy standards. But controversial they were, especially to CBS, who aired (and eventually canceled) the Smothers' show. Turns out that Tommy, the \"dumb\" one, was in fact a gadfly who turned the program into a cause c&#xE9;l&#xE8;bre somewhat beyond its actual significance; and in the end, as one of the talking heads featured here points out, it was the Smothers' decreasing sense of fun that really doomed it. Both brothers are interviewed, as are writers Rob Reiner and Steve Martin and others.

{"description": "\"There is something going on in the organization that is very undesirable and might lead to serious consequences,\" reads a note that the ill-fated Victor Dean wrote to his superior just before he took a fatal fall down the metal staircase at Pym's Publicity Ltd. These darned suspicious circumstances lead Pym to hire Lord Peter Wimsey to determine whether Dean's death was an accident or murder or eh, what? Ian Carmichael returns in his signature role as Dorothy L. Sayers's aristocratic sleuth in this characteristically impeccable 1973 BBC miniseries. The chaotic advertising agency is a ripe setting for intrigue (Sayers herself worked in a prominent London ad agency in the 1920s). Wimsey has a high time masquerading incognito as the firm's new copywriter, as well as the mysterious costumed Harlequin, a ruse he adopts to obtain information from the notorious socialite Dian de Momerie (Bridget Armstrong), whose lovers (Dean, among them) all come to bad ends, and whose den of iniquity is fronted by Major Milligan (Peter Bowles, ofTo the Manor Born), a drug dealer who corrupts bright young things.Among the pleasures of a Wimsey mystery is his panache with the niceties of our English tongue. At one point he observes, \"Truth in advertising is like lemon in three measures of meal. It produces a suitable quantity of gas with which to blow out a mass of crude misrepresentations into a format the public can swallow.\" Let's see Nick Charles or Columbo wrap his tongue around that one.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B00BDSRM4K", "045000242X", "B00005MFIL", "B000062XDX", "B002TY78PU", "B00009WNVN", "B000056C0K", "B00005RIWV", "B00008DDXE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00BDSRM4K", "045000242X", "B00005MFIL", "B000062XDX"]}, "price": 30.49, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 280488}, "asin": "B00007E1WX", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/512BASX295L._SX300_.jpg", "title": "Lord Peter Wimsey - Murder Must Advertise"}

It's harder to choose the bigger liability: the dialogue howlers (as Fiennes binds Graham in ropes, she says, \"Sometimes I feel like I don't know you\") or the incredibly obvious solution to the big mystery. The story is an unofficial update of Hitchcock'sSuspicion: a new wife wonders whether her unbelievably charismatic husband might be a murderer. The Chinese filmmaker Chen Kaige (Farewell My Concubine) turns out to be exactly the wrong director for this overheated slice ofl'amour fouin London, but with the hopeless pairing of Graham and Fiennes as the passionate lovers, he didn't have much of a chance.

He arrives wide eyed and full of optimism hoping to serve God and his parish, however, he quickly butts heads with the elder priest in charge, Father Benito. Benito is known to accept drug money from the local drug lord in order to subsidise the construction of a new hospital and in addition is carrying on an affair with a local woman. To complicate matters, father Amaro soon finds himself in a love affair with the young Sunday school teacher. After a newspaper report, linking the drug lords with the Church, is published, Father Amaro is then trying to cover up and mend the public relations fiasco. Amaro has also been asked by the Bishop to reign in the renegade priest who has affiliations with guerrilla soldiers. Needless to say, moraldilemmas abound and Father Amaro's idealism is put to the test by personal, political and church press", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005N8A9", "B0002TT0MI", "B00005JL57", "B001UV4XC4", "B0007OCG5G", "B0036TGSJE", "B002FHGESI", "B00005JNCZ", "B0041KKYF6", "B00006BS7S", "B00080Z53O", "B00180IPM6", "B004XVMCMG", "B000N3T0DW", "B002M2T1V8", "B000GETTJI", "B00AZMFKXK", "B008S2NABI", "B0047685T6", "B000H0M4AW", "B000FII31A", "B000O76ZQC", "B001BNFR8U", "B000JBXH78", "B002M2T1VI", "B000K2V7F0", "B000YIGNCC", "B00006G8G3", "B002H0LCGM", "B0011FLH14", "B003O3EKRO", "B000M7Y4S0", "B00005JLQW", "B000QYKDFC", "B005HFI7IU", "B000LP5CW0", "B002VECLXC", "B000LV6OC6", "B0015ET3YO", "B00H1RMPH6", "B0042EJDGM", "B000WC38IC", "B000274TLW", "B00E1S1MMM", "B0002VEZ3U", "B0052LE7C4", "B00GJNQ3S0", "B003A0T8BO", "B001M5BF7Y", "B004GAYRKE", "B0007NBJHI", "B003R9IET0", "B001RHV6OO", "B00005LZOD", "B00AZMFL2K", "B004EPYZNK", "B0019K4YT8", "B005CFBZ3O", "B004SIP7S0", "B002FUI4CE", "B00E5G03KM", "B000GI3S0A", "B005ZEM8WY", "B004SIP6GI", "B0000AGQ5V", "B007961SAE", "B000AYYVII", "B001QX014A", "B002JHD9BE", "B009AVCA6W", "B004MOJW0E", "B000GI3KDA", "B001S400C0", "B0001CNQX0", "B000YIGND6", "B000AYEIDQ", "B00D6T4RSI", "B000LXHFMW", "B00AEFXGIY", "0811215326", "B000QGE84M", "B00GHP8SH4", "B0000C9JFO", "B002O0FSQA", "B000RHRGSK", "B00000F5KH", "B000063K0I", "B00007KK52", "B006KSAPV0", "B001CC7PLM", "B001ILTUKQ", "B001R4XRLC", "B003C5VOVE", "B000AM4P90", "B00FNUQNAS", "B0000ZG0NQ", "B00GGS2A12", "B00003CXRG", "B000HDZJWO"], "bought_together": ["B00005N8A9", "B00005JL57"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005N8A9", "B0002TT0MI", "B006KN393Q", "B00005JNCZ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 76874}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.27, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B00008AOX5", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51feH53VVFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Crime of Padre Amaro"}

{"description": "Harvard professors Richard Alpert and Timothy Leary made countercultural history in 1963 when they were fired from that institution for conducting controversial psychedelic drug research. In the purple haze aftermath, Alpert journeyed to India and found his guru Maharaj ji, who renamed him Ram Dass (\"Servant of God\"). Best known for his 1971 bestseller BE HERE NOW, which was a spiritual touchstone of the era, Ram Dass became an inspiration to people across the globe. Filmmaker Mickey Lemle--who has known his subject for more than twenty-five years--intersperses vivid archival footage from hippiedom's glory days with intimate glimpses of Ram Dass today, as he continues to remake his life since being--in his words--\"stroked\" in 1997. Named by NEWSWEEK as one of the Top Five Non-Fiction Films of 2002, RAM DASS FIERCE GRACE is an engrossing, poignant meditation on spirituality, consciousness, healing and the unexpected grace of aging.", "related": {"also_bought": ["1573228710", "1591795125", "B00DF3EXY8", "0517543052", "1604079673", "0553285726", "0061961388", "0385084137", "B00IOMTYW6", "1591794978", "1400046238", "0789017520", "1400054036", "1615441395", "B002B8YORE", "1887474005", "0062235915", "0394729471", "B000AA4JHK", "0131444514", "1573220493", "1573245747", "B00JK00CEU", "0941524582", "0060750553", "1584650109", "1401939147", "B002JGVMXW", "0809142848", "0060697024", "1577314220", "B004JOBTRQ", "B005CW5E2A", "0874776783", "1845400224", "158270399X", "098392712X", "006196137X", "B00AOCDEF2", "1591795494", "B000HLDFHW", "1604074345", "B0044M2OS6", "B002LFPABG", "1401919812", "B002MFTZY8", "1557788731", "1585423262", "1590302931", "1591431352", "B000AA4JI4", "0553352660", "B008B9JTXG", "1577315510", "B00BBZDVQS", "B000S76VHQ", "B005U0ZP46", "1570622590", "0060765100", "0061338168", "1591794994", "1890350451", "B0002O06PI", "B0033XUHAO", "1401910939", "0615388442", "1572245379", "1400054028", "B005ZOFJNE", "1401903568", "1401944051", "0893860468", "B00317LM8I", "0300165323", "B00A4W355G", "1937006387", "B000K7UEN6", "1590302656", "B000K7UEMW", "B00BGDB77U", "051788500X", "1590304241", "B000QEIOSU", "1591430771", "B003ZUTTDG", "0671657860", "B005HI4LLO", "076790009X", "B00FTE5R4G", "146929379X", "1611800676", "B002W1HBM0", "B000B6FXWS", "1567184855", "1937195171", "0061777269", "B000IOM0XS", "1611800765", "1591791065"], "bought_together": ["1573228710", "0517543052"], "buy_after_viewing": ["1573228710", "0517543052", "0061961388", "1604079673"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 23134}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 22.03, "brand": "Gaiam", "asin": "B00008DDV1", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51EDK9YK9NL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Ram Dass: Fierce Grace"}

{"description": "Depending on how you liked this romantic comedy, you just might find more laughs in the delightful banter between the director and his two stars on the commentary track. Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant join writer-director Marc Lawrence for a lively 102 minutes of conversation. Not much movie magic is discussed, but the three talents will sacrifice all for a good joke. It's best to watch the commentary track with the \"Two Bleeps Notice\" viewing option: when a heart appears on-screen, you can immediately view outtakes from that stage of the film. The flubs, on-set antics, and jokes are all guaranteed to bring a laugh. Other extras include two additional scenes (the wedding finale was judicially cut) and a HBO puff-piece on the making of the film.

{"description": "Though it bears little resemblance to the original 1969 thriller starring Michael Caine, the 2003 remake ofThe Italian Jobstands on its own as a caper comedy that's well above average. The title's a misnomer--this time it's actually a Los Angeles job--but the action's just as exciting as it propels a breezy tale of honor and dishonor among competing thieves. Inheriting Caine's role as ace heist-planner Charlie Croker, Mark Wahlberg plays straight-man to a well-cast team of accomplices, including Mos Def, Jason Statham, and scene-stealer Seth Green in a variation of the role originally played by Noel Coward. As the daughter of Croker's ill-fated mentor (Donald Sutherland), Charlize Theron is recruited to double-cross a double-crosser (Edward Norton in oily villain mode), and once again, speedily versatile Mini Coopers play a pivotal role in director F. Gary Gray's exhilarating car-chase climax. It's perhaps the greatest product placement in movie history, and just as fun the second time around.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEBB86A", "B00AEFY0XE", "B0000AUHPB", "B0019EXZY4", "B00004Z4WR", "B005LAIGLE", "B001MTYRKC", "B000ZS8GWQ", "B000J3OTT6", "B00AEBB8LA", "B000P0J0BK", "B00BB67UNW", "B004HO6HWA", "B004P7CMVE", "0767818024", "B004ULNJIU", "B003Q6D2B4", "B001F12J0C", "B001QB9H10", "B004EPYZP8", "B008E70EES", "B00BEIYN9Q", "B0062P3392", "B001TODCII", "B002GSXKP6", "B000BTITKS", "B0010YVCB6", "B000K7UBSO", "078322933X", "B001ILHY1I", "B0007P0XBO", "B002O3Z4Z2", "B003UESJHO", "B000AP04FG", "B0002ZDVEU", "B000JYW5BE", "B000W1V5VU", "B00008AOVL", "B00005JLIF", "B000093FLA", "6305657947", "6304711891", "B003L20IG0", "B00DU22OI6", "B005LAIGRS", "B008JFURII", "B002XMGGK6", "B002DU39GW", "B00HEPC0TS", "B005LAIILM", "B000P0J0C4", "B00AEFXT1S", "B000W9DTG6", "B000M341QE", "B002NZK5UU", "B000X1Z0C4", "B00AEFZ2DG", "B000FKO5QK", "B001UV4XGA", "B00023B1LC", "B000GFLKF8", "B00005JLSB", "B000ENC5YW", "B00AEFY5B6", "B001J710Z2", "B002ZG99H2", "B000VWYJ86", "B00005JN0T", "B002ZG999U", "6305428115", "B00000JGNP", "B00140PK82", "B002ZG9864", "B002GIBVVQ", "B004H83IFK", "B00BEIYLO8", "B00005UQ9T", "6304806434", "0783240295", "B005LAIGXW", "B00003CY0V", "B000KF0GWW", "B000P0J0EW", "B00005JLX2", "B002VECM6S", "B002ZG97RE", "B002O3Z4XY", "B000E5N684", "B002ZG980U", "B00005B6JZ", "B001N44BVQ", "B000FKO3WG", "B00005JKBC", "B007REV4T8", "B00E8RKHWW", "B001DZOC6Y", "B0012KJ0DK", "B002GHHHP6", "B00005JN0W", "B00AQSN7HE"], "bought_together": ["B00AEBB86A", "B00AEFY0XE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0000AUHPB", "B00AEBB86A", "B00004Z4WR", "B005LAIIHG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 8732}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.0, "brand": "Paramount", "asin": "B0000B1OFL", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51X762iDLcL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Italian Job"}
{"description": "A northern Spanish coastal town suffers from its own isolationism as shipyards close down, leaving the labor force scouring the streets for temp jobs with only their stubborn pride to show for it. Among the disillusioned is Santa (Javier Bardem), a cocksure, angry rebel who refuses to admit his own failures. Santa is the ring leader of a group of rapidly aging friends whose unemployed status causes them mounting grief. They drown their sorrows in an otherwise empty bar owned by Rico (Joaquin Climent), one of their coworkers from what now seems another life. While Santa tries to clumsily seduce women and pay for a lamp post he vandalized in anger, his companions battle serious alcoholism, loan denials, and marriage troubles, as they all face their own insignificance.Javier Bardem perfectly embodies the defiant loser that is Santa. Letting himself go and carrying a hefty gut, Bardem manages to exude the false charm of a bitter sad sack who has remained a lady's man. Captured in gritty detail, director Fernando Leon de Aranoa offers a shattered image of the proud work force of northern Spain in a picture that won five Goya Awards, Spain's equivalent to the Oscars.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0011FLH14", "B00003CXRG", "B00080Z53O", "B00116GEJ8", "B0041KKYF6", "B0000AGQ5V", "B00005JNCZ", "B001DJ7PR8", "B004MOJW0E", "B000088UZ4", "B00005N8A9", "B00HOGBXS6", "B002VECLXC", "B000LXHFMW", "B0002TT0MI", "B00005JLQW", "B008S2NABI", "B00FRILRW0", "B00005JL57", "B002M2T1V8", "B0000C9JFO", "B0041KKYFG", "B000Y54UUC", "B000N3T0DW", "B00HRJVHEK", "B001S400C0", "B002BWP3UC", "B0042816YK", "B001OXLGJQ", "B009GIGY3E", "B004XVMCMG", "B006C1S1DY", "B00006G8G3", "B00H9HZITU", "B00AZMFKXK", "B0036TGSJE", "B0019K4YT8", "B00FXWAZX2", "B002M2T1VI", "B00005421W", "B006HAJAGM", "B000O76ZQC", "6305132917", "B0007OCG5G", "B00005LZOD", "B00000F7E6", "B00009MEJ6", "B00023P4N8", "B002AK7SB2", "B000Q7ZLRY", "B000E1YVZK", "B00ATK02FO", "B0006GANN2", "B000083C5F", "B008LC8V1Y", "B0019UGYAU", "B000OVLBGC", "B008220DGE", "B00005AAF5", "B0041KXT26", "B00195FUFA", "B000N2HDH8"], "bought_together": ["B0011FLH14"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00003CXRG", "B0000AGQ5V", "B0011FLH14", "B00116GEJ8"]}, "price": 9.95, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 335212}, "asin": "B0000CBXZ3", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/511PG5GYMBL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Mondays in the Sun"}
{"description": "Winner of the prestigious Golden Lion award at the 1998 Venice Film Festival,The Way We Laughedis another richly layered drama from Gianni Amelio, the acclaimed director of the multiple-award-winning 1995 arthouse hitLamerica.  A tragic tale of brotherhood, Amelio's ambitiously structured film spans six years (1958-64) in the lives of an illiterate Sicilian named Giovanni (Enrico Lo Verso, fromLamerica) and his younger, enigmatic brother Pietro (Francesco Guiffrida) as they seek a new life in the class-divided city of Turin. Divided into six novel-like chapters that cover one pivotal day in each passing year, this emotionally resonant drama reveals how the gradually successful Giovanni desperately wants Pietro to achieve respectability as a schoolteacher. But when a sudden murder forces each brother into moral compromise, Amelio's film evolves into a mysterious study of dysfunctional loyalty, charting the growth of postwar Italy as it charts the love and sacrifice that will change the brothers' lives forever. While it demands the viewer's rapt attention,The Way We Laughedis a satisfying film that offers no easy answers to its complex human equation.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004D45NZG", "B0019X3YT6", "B00008ZZ9N", "B000CR8QV6", "B0083H502K", "B006MHZ46A", "B001UE49BQ", "B000ERVKOE", "B000FI8MG6", "B00124SNIY", "B000EMGF1M", "B00124SNIO", "B0025YTB5O"], "bought_together": ["B0019X3YT6"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 363283}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 10.66, "brand": "", "asin": "B0000D9PFH", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RBZ1ZRJSL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Way We Laughed"}

Combining live-action set in a dystopian near future (filmed in Poland) and digital imagery set within a state-sponsored virtual combat game called Avalon, this sluggishly paced but visually dazzling film is another brain-teaser from the director ofGhost in the Shell. The action focuses on a maverick Avalon ace named Ash (played by the lovely Polish actress Malgorzata Foremniak) who advances to the game's highest and most mysterious level, \"Class Real,\" a virtual world so authentically convincing that some--called \"the Unreturned\"--choose never to leave it. As with theMatrixtrilogy,Avalonis more intriguing in premise than execution, filled with hushed tones and heavy-handed portent. Still, the amber-hued ruins of Oshii's virtual landscape are oddly alluring as a means of escape--a warning from Oshii, perhaps, that even the most exciting virtual reality is a trap that can prove deadly to those who fall into it willingly.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B003V5OO9O", "B000E5LF0K", "B000056HP4", "B000FILUL0", "B00I462XNO", "B003TRMLQM", "B009D004RM", "B0006A9FMI", "B001D265RQ", "B00I3C1T6G", "B002T9H2ME", "B001VBM0Z0", "B00HXEWECI", "B003KGBIRK", "B008L0YMSW", "B00005UW7E", "B0001EFTVA", "B00I3C1T1Q", "B006OB3K56", "B008M4MB8K", "B000HT387Q", "B0002LE9NQ", "B004I11VZK"], "bought_together": ["B003V5OO9O"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000056HP4", "B000E5LF0K", "B00005T7HW", "B00004RE27"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 176282}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 29.9, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B0000D9PNY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518P8X348VL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Avalon"}
{"description": "This perfectly pleasant, if minor, coming-of-age comedy-drama is the second feature released via the Miramax/HBO/Ben Affleck-Matt Damon TV programProject Greenlight. Series viewers watchedHeightsdirectors Kyle Rankin and Efram Potelle struggle to get their vision of screenwriter Erica Beeney's story past an intractable producer. If the process was not pretty, the final result--i.e., this film--has some nice things. Leading the list is rising star Shia LaBeouf (Holes) as likable, 17-year-old misfit Kelly Ernswiler, coasting through life and fascinated by simulated war games. He befriends a sweet but cynical preppie, Bart Bowland (Elden Hensen), whose sexy older sister, Tabby (Amy Smart), offers Kelly a glimpse of adult passions and heartache. The cast is strong, including Kathleen Quinlan and William Sadler as the Caulfield-esque hero's troubled parents. There are solid moments of comedy and affecting, better-than-average drama.

{"description": "The sixth season ofBuffy the Vampire Slayerfollowed the logic of plot and character development into some gloomy places. The year begins with Buffy being raised from the dead by the friends who miss her, but who fail to understand that a sacrifice taken back is a sacrifice negated. Dragged out of what she believes to have been heavenly bliss, she finds herself \"going through the motions\" and entering into a relationship with the evil, besotted vampire Spike just to force her emotions.  Willow becomes ever more caught up in the temptations of magic; Xander and Anya move towards marriage without ever discussing their reservations; Giles feels he is standing in the way of Buffy's adult independence; Dawn feels neglected. What none of them need is a menace that is, at this point, simply annoying--three high school contemporaries who have turned their hand to magical and high-tech villainy. Added to this is a hungry ghost, an invisibility ray, an amnesia spell and a song-and-dance demon (who acts as rationale for the incomparable musical episode \"Once More, with Feeling\").This is a year in which chickens come home to roost: everything from the villainy of the three geeks to Xander's doubts about marriage come to a head, often--as in the case of the impressive wedding episode--through wildly dark humor. The estrangement of the characters from each other--a well-observed portrait of what happens to college pals in their early 20s--comes to a shocking head with the death of a major character and that death's apocalyptic consequences. The series ends on a consoling note which it has, by that point and in spite of imperfections, entirely earned.--Roz Kaveney", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000EHSVN2", "B000EHSVM8", "B000EHSVLY", "B000EHSVLE", "B000EHSVL4", "B000EHSVKK", "B000I0QLRI", "B000I0QLRS", "B000I0QLS2", "B000I0QLQY", "B000I0QLR8", "B007H9CNOI", "B000HD1482", "B003YF9Q08", "1593078226", "B00006J3WH", "B0006IUE16", "B0009W5J4Q", "B002JVWR4U", "B000ERVJM2", "B000GG4Y6O", "B000JLTRIG", "B000CCBCGM", "1595825584", "1595826106", "B000B5XOW0", "B00001R3O1", "B0024FAR66", "B001FB4W0C", "B00AMDA2QC", "1595821651", "B005CM1IIE", "B000OIOPHC", "B006LG74Q0", "B00JF5G8WU", "159307963X", "B00344EAQO", "B0000AQS0F", "B00466H3CW", "B002U8XW9Q", "B000X5SPBI", "1595824154", "B000BOH990", "B000BOH98G", "1595823425", "B00133QNSG", "B003R4ZMN6", "B00511N79O", "B000O77SN6", "B008EVT42W", "B000BOH986", "B000CNE0SS", "B009LDCXNY", "B0002XVKMM", "B000RO6JYK", "B00076ONT6", "B009LDCWWG", "B00IWTVDUW", "B000FP2OPY", "B006LG74RE", "B000R7GKQE", "B0010YSD7M", "B00243FQFA", "B000O77SMW", "1442412097", "B003R0MF7G", "B002JVWRAO", "B009LDD4V4", "B001MVWRNO", "B001AQO43M", "0789326302", "B000JW1TYU", "B000AO9BSS", "1595823107", "B004YM6JLO", "B0000C9JFQ", "B0006J28E6", "B001RXDM2C", "B000EXDS3E", "B005PPMHO2", "B00466H3CC", "B0058YPGL6", "B00133QNS6", "B00006FD9N", "B001992NWO", "B0001O3YLM", "1595829229", "B00A8KJN8M", "B003L77GAQ", "B00133QNRW", "B00005JNOG", "B001MVWRNE", "B00AMDA2P8", "B00HEQOAIQ", "B000G1R4TS", "B0077PTWHI", "B001QE99AQ", "B000EXDS34", "B00344EAKA", "B001M5UDGS"], "bought_together": ["B000EHSVN2", "B000EHSVM8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000EHSVM8", "B000EHSVLY", "B0046XG48O", "B000EHSVLE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 112363}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 34.59, "brand": "", "asin": "B0000DANYD", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/417707V8Z5L._SX300_.jpg", "title": "Buffy The Vampire Slayer - The Complete Sixth Season"}
{"description": "A man pursues his sexual obsessions to their darkest and most dangerous extremes in this gay-themed drama based on a novel by Dennis Cooper. Dennis (Michael Gunther) is a gay man, who as a teenager developed a perverse attraction to violent pornography and simulated snuff photographs, which he describes in great detail in a series of letters to his former lover Julian (Jaie Laplante). As Dennis grows older, his fascination with the darker side of the sexual underground grows more intense, and in time he meets Henry (Craig Chester), a masochist who posed for some of the pictures that sparked his interest in S&M.; When Dennis learns that Henry was murdered, he weaves the incident into an elaborate fantasy, in which Dennis suffers a painful death in a dungeon of erotic torture. In time, Dennis graduates from violent fantasies to sadistic interludes with a male prostitute (Michael Stock) and eventually plans a series of sexually-oriented murders, concluding with an episode in which Dennis and two collaborators (Parker Posey and James Lyons) drug a young punk (Alexis Arquette) into unconsciousness. After having group sex, Dennis and his cohorts murder the punk. As one might expect, Frisk proved to be highly controversial and received a sharply divided reaction in its screening as the closing night attraction at the 1996 San Francisco International Lesbian and Gay Film Festival; some hailed it as a disturbing and iconoclastic masterpiece, while roughly half the audience angrily stormed out of the theater before the film's conclusion. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00GHP8SH4", "B00GSA3K6C", "B00FPVGWY2", "B00D1BODEY", "B00I4CWIVU", "B000I2J5TW", "B00F98FOPE", "B005XGJW50", "B0000541AE", "B000MGBM2C", "B00HHYF5EI", "B00E44FEAE", "B00HW3F1IO", "B00GKP70HU", "B00069A6CC", "B00BSHYZGY", "B00AWQEK26", "B00GWWV1XU", "B0080JX4Y2", "B00B4MMQJ6", "B00IA7MFEO", "B00E849QSG", "B00E5PHTR8", "B00I567EWS", "B008N25X7M", "B00996RSYM", "B00DUJH8V2", "B00HQKREFG", "B001AOC9K4", "B00HUQCA28", "B001L1CNFC", "B00JVQ7QTM", "B0000DD75T", "B005ZI6N1M", "B00AFQSYCK", "B000JSI7F8", "B000NJLX54", "B005OTQIK8", "B001FXG2DK", "B00EMAGKNU", "B004L03B3S", "B005GM38MO", "6305847045", "B00CBIC1H4", "B002L1YGRY", "B0042L0OFY", "B007OXB1GI", "B00064AFFA", "B0042837LU", "B004THJ3BC", "B00005U14H", "B0016MJ6WY", "B005OQS8EU", "B007L6JQ3S", "B00134SU2C", "B001ATWK4E", "B00HX3ZJOY", "B00005U14O", "B000RW5CBS", "B001UDPAAG", "B000F6II1M", "B00IFRN0OI", "B00B02QUOC", "B008JFX04G", "B00FYL08RK", "B00F878KAC", "B0002QO1MK", "B000KRN2KI", "B00005JO5L", "B0056G1APC", "B0099PW0D2", "B000AYELEC", "B000CR7R7K", "B004RIACU4", "B000HWXPXK", "B007IV4ODS", "B00CBFB8SU", "B005TIK4SQ", "B006VJI6IM", "B001AZKB8K", "B003B2UK1S", "B00ADU287U", "B001F114IA", "B0058W0EPQ", "B009SFR2QI", "B00005UF80", "B000GBEWIO", "B00DUJH94S", "B001CO32HQ", "B004OBQDCK", "B002R8EK4U", "B009W8MYK0", "B000EGEKRO", "B002BIULP8", "B002R3CQDC"], "bought_together": ["B000I2J5TW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AWQEK26", "B00IA7MFEO", "B000I2J5TW", "076784257X"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 198379}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 18.95, "brand": "", "asin": "B0000DC150", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51V7AAD39DL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Frisk"}

{"description": "American sitcoms usually have a bland, likable central character who has  to cope with obnoxious acquaintances--who usually provide most of the  actual comedy. The British smartly put the comic personalities front and  center, andKeeping Up Appearanceshas one of the best: The petty,  pretentious, tyrannical Hyacinth Bucket (played by the impressive Patricia  Routledge), a dowdy middle-class social climber with a piercing voice and  an unshakable faith in herself. Upon learning that her mailman has seven  children, she declares disapprovingly, \"Quite an achievement when you have  to be up so early.\" Whether she's scheming to invite a minor local  celebrity to a garden party or scowling at an enormous dog left in her  driveway, Hyacinth terrorizes all around her, particularly her  long-suffering husband Richard (Clive Swift), who takes a small delight in  subverting her efforts from time to time; her trembling neighbors  Elizabeth and Emmett (Josephine Tewson and David Griffin), who scarcely  leave their house lest they be invited in to coffee; and her  sexually frustrated lower-class sisters Daisy and Rose (Judy Cornwell and  Mary Millar) and Daisy's layabout husband Onslow (Geoffrey Hughes), who  longs to be left in peace to eat chips and watch the races.Though  Americans aren't as class-conscious as the Brits, snobbery is universal,  andKeeping Up Appearanceshas developed an appreciative cult  following on this side of the Atlantic. The boxed setHyacinth Springs  Eternalcontains the third, fourth, and fifth series; but Hyacinth  lives in a bizarrely unchanging universe, so you can start with any  episode and soon be caught up in her titanic struggle to be the envy of  her peers.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000079DND", "B00007JZUF", "B002I9TZHA", "B00007JZUE", "B0002F6BT2", "B00007JZUC", "B00006CY7I", "B00007JZUD", "B0000TG8U2", "B001JV5BBC", "B0000TG8UW", "B004EPZ00C", "B0002F6BTC", "B002LFPAUC", "B0009S2SPI", "B0000TG8V6", "B000163X70", "B00005JM20", "B00005A1SY", "B0000TG8UM", "B0016RNLZW", "B000069HXI", "B0000A02YA", "B000069HXE", "B0009WFFBS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0002F6BTC", "B00007JZUF", "B00EF4U7AK", "B000079DND"]}, "price": 15.0, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 124786}, "asin": "B0000TG49C", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/616EKSKDW9L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Keeping Up Appearances - Hyacinth Springs Eternal Set (Vol. 5-8)"}

Jeremy Irons, who seems to be enjoying himself enormously, is a thief who sets out on a sailing voyage, only to fetch up in Morocco after he blacks out at the helm. There he meets sultry singerPatricia Kaas(her first acting role); it turns out they both might have brain tumors. Did someone say this is a romantic comedy? It is, complete with musical numbers (Kaas glides through a cozy cross-section of French pop music, including the theme fromA Man and a Woman, Lelouch's '60s smash). The movie's all over the place, and it spins its wheels for the final half-hour, but there are certain kinds of romantics who will find this sort of thing irresistible.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00009V7RV", "B003M0I9EE", "B00FF9SKQW", "B000092T3H", "B0030T120A", "B005ZVIPG0", "B00366F2NU", "B00BTYXNPK", "B000BGQUH0", "B000056BP3", "B0000UJL82", "B000EOTW3I", "B00009YXEN", "B0007G89FK", "B009KZMFOA", "B00GMV8L1Q", "B002UOOMP8", "B0007WRT4Q", "B0010SAGHS", "B00004U2K1", "B002SV3KN8", "B00092ZKZ4", "B007UW9WMS", "B00070HK24", "B001TK80CU", "B005CFBZ3O", "B0009298N4", "B00005JPX8", "B000ERVJQ8", "B001L57ZZG", "B00003CY6A", "B00005BCKG", "B005KBEHIU", "B005FITIGO", "B000254IEW", "B001J0FVY0", "B00000298J", "B00079ZA68", "B001QMGENS", "B0009A404I", "B005ETALGK"], "bought_together": ["B00009V7RV", "B000092T3H"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005ZVIPG0", "B00366F2NU", "B003M0I9EE", "B000092T3H"]}, "price": 59.89, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 151552}, "asin": "B0000UJLF0", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HGBTV4W4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "And Now Ladies &amp; Gentlemen"}

The first segment of the four-part, 54-minute documentary is mostly self-congratulation and plot summary (which is not necessarily a bad thing); more interesting are the creature effects and the actors learning how to do their own stunts.  If you were wondering if the voice of the Lycan Raze was really that deep, you can listen to him--actor/co-writer Kevin Grevioux--along with director Len Wiseman and co-writer Danny McBride on the first commentary track as they discuss breaking the rulebook for vampires and shooting in Budapest on a tiny $22 million budget.

{"description": "\"It'sPride and Prejudicewith dirty bits.\" That's how screenwriter Andrew Davies (Bridget Jones' Diary), in an interview contained on this disc, describes his adaptation of Sarah Waters's acclaimednovelof lesbian love, betrayal, and redemption in Victorian England. This three-part BBC production chronicles with relish the story of Nan Astley (Rachael Stirling, the ravishing image of her mother, Diana Rigg), barely 18, and certain that life holds more for her than her oyster girl's existence. \"You'll meet someone who'll have your head spinning and your legs turning to jelly,\" her sister promises. That someone surprisingly turns out to be \"gay and bold\"  Kitty Butler (Keeley Hawes), a music-hall entertainer, with whom Nan falls instantly, and swooningly, in love. Nan follows her to London, where, as a double act, they become the toast of London, until Kitty's \"marriage of convenience\" breaks up the act and Nan's heart. The outcast Nan, decked out in Victor/Victoria duds, becomes a streetwalker, and then \"tart\" to the aptly named Diana Leatherby (Anna Chancellor). This affair, too, comes to \"a bad end\" as a destitute Nan is deposited back on the streets, where she insinuates herself into the lives of Florence (Jodhi May), a social worker, and her socialist brother. Is Nan \"too spoiled and stained for love?\" Will she risk her blossoming relationship with Florence when Kitty inevitably returns to rekindle their affair? There is enough \"backbiting and bitching\" to fuel several seasons ofThe O.C.Nan's couplings, while tastefully done, do carry what Waters, in the co-interview with Davies, calls \"a queer erotic charge.\" They are graphic by Cinemax standards, let alone the BBC. But the sterling writing and performances will captivate even the most sensitive viewers, making this groundbreaking miniseries, to quote one character, \"a delightful evening... a rare treat.\"--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000A4T804", "B00006RJ97", "B008XAGN46", "B00002CGGH", "B004BJMEO6", "B002SF9YTS", "B00AFDN5Y0", "B000OVLC0W", "B000F7CEBG", "B004AYMY92", "B000J4QWIG", "B0038M61IC", "B0001HAGSI", "B00004U104", "B004EI2NM2", "B00827OWO8", "B005Q4CLKW", "B00005QW5T", "B00ELE8D2I", "1573229725", "B00023P4M4", "B00GPPXNIK", "B000SUKPL6", "B00009MEB8", "B007ZQAKIE", "B000AQOHN0", "B00FKPJ3VM", "B000O76ZO4", "B00CBG9SQS", "B004N21KIC", "B00EVKQ2YS", "B004AHAEV4", "B00H3RT7M0", "B003YYVSEG", "1573228737", "B00004YKR3", "B001YXXRZ2", "B000F3UA6Q", "B00005OLBC", "B001MVWMIY", "B00004STHG", "B001E2PQGG", "B00006CXI7", "1594482306", "B0009Q0EMY", "B00BDTSLEO", "B000F4RHBQ", "B00003CYJ4", "1573221368", "B000062Y1E", "B0039S3872", "B00125WAWI", "B003OYPOUA", "B0085E44W8", "1567302246", "B0009298MU", "B008R6U69Y", "B00EMAGCHE", "B0002KPIQY", "B00C1LIZEE", "B00005NRNS", "B0074FUSFG", "B005JZBPHS", "B007W6XXAE", "B00GPPXNQ2", "B001451HVG", "B007PXYWUO", "B0000639HI", "B00004LMDJ", "B00AG474YU", "B000HT3P4M", "B00005BKZK", "1594633118", "B000AM6OVW", "B00005UJYC", "B0011FLGV0", "B0000JD29M", "B00DYZ80S2", "B000CELORM", "B00CLH0APA", "B000JJRYDI", "B00GRZPRB4", "B003E1QC1S", "B00BBXSP84", "B002LEZ5TY", "B004XYABMQ", "B00I8PA95A", "B00003CWN3", "B000F3UA70", "1573441996", "B000NJL4QC", "B003CP1T50", "B00177Y9TS", "B001D11A2W", "B008N0EWTY", "B00HW3EXCE", "1594484465"], "bought_together": ["B000A4T804", "B00006RJ97"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000A4T804", "B004BJMEO6", "B00AFDN5Y0", "B008XAGN46"]}, "price": 18.0, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 15074}, "asin": "B00011Y1QC", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/511HERAPTAL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Tipping the Velvet"}

{"description": "As upscale sitcoms go,Something's Gotta Givehas more to offer than most romantic comedies. Obviously working through some semi-autobiographical issues regarding \"women of a certain age,\" writer-director Nancy Meyers brings adequate credibility and above-average intelligence to what is essentially (but not exclusively) a fantasy premise, in which an aging lothario who's always dated younger women (Jack Nicholson, more or less playing himself) falls for a successful middle-aged playwright (Diane Keaton) who's convinced she's past the age of romance, much less sexual re-awakening. As long as old pals Nicholson and Keaton are on screen discussing their dilemma or discovering their mutual desire,Something's Gotta Giveis terrific, proving (in case anyone had forgotten) that Hollywood can and should aim for an older demographic. Myers falls short with the sitcom device of a younger lover (Keanu Reeves) who wants Keaton as much as Nicholson does; it's believable but shallow and too easily dismissed. Myers also skimps on supporting roles for Frances McDormand, Amanda Peet, and Jon Favreau, but thankfully this is one romantic comedy that doesn't pander to youth. Mature viewers, rejoice!--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0038N9WKU", "0767811100", "B000MQC9H4", "B000YAF4MA", "B000OCZA04", "B0038N9X40", "B00AEFXYOA", "B00AEBB9WI", "B0000YTP1G", "B00AEBB8YW", "B000EMGJ7C", "B000YDBPAM", "B0000VD02Y", "B000023VTP", "B000EHRVOW", "B0009OL7Z4", "B00005JLSK", "B000XJD33O", "B0000542C9", "B00AEBB8NS", "B001ECDVK4", "B00006FMUW", "6304765266", "B004SEUJK0", "B003ASLJK4", "B0000AOV4I", "6305236569", "B002VECM6S", "B002K0WBXW", "B00008G7UF", "B000J103OI", "B0042816YK", "B00081U7HC", "6305213283", "B004SIP9RO", "B003BV8ICC", "B0015I2RT8", "078322740X", "6305212112", "B008R65XWO", "6305657947", "B0017ANAZO", "B0000JBALO", "B00EIBO8T6", "B00AEFYHVO", "B00005JNDZ", "B0099114WO", "B0088X7Z6S", "B007JNR54A", "B00005JPSM", "076784744X", "B002ZG988M", "B00386EZKE", "B000683VI4", "B00AEBB9FA", "B004EPZ070", "B00003CXSM", "B00AEFY99O", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00AEFY4CG", "B00005JG6N", "0783226772", "B000JYW5B4", "B003Y5H574", "B0038N9X3Q", "B002GHHHGU", "B000CCW2P2", "B00004TJKK", "B0017ANB08", "B00AEFXX9Q", "B000P0J0EW", "B004SIP8LG", "B000A343RI", "079073219X", "B0045HCJJ4", "B000CCBCAS", "B000HEWEE4", "0792833198", "B000765IJK", "B0002I84N0", "B001DDBCUA", "6304907729", "B003Y5H524", "B000ENC5YW", "B0007IO6NM", "B005S9EJ14", "B004FQX5B6", "B000HEWEJO", "B0001I55M4", "B00003CXFV", "B00005JLH0", "B00DDT0JB0", "B002U4UYYQ", "B00DW5ILUG", "B00005JN3W", "B00006ZXSO", "B00007E2F5", "B004SIP9VA", "B00118T632", "B004A8ZWSS"], "bought_together": ["B0038N9WKU", "B000MQC9H4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0038N9WKU", "0767811100", "B000MQC9H4", "B00AEBB9WI"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 2886}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.79, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B0001AVZA8", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Q5RC1103L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Something's Gotta Give"}

{"description": "The ranks of fictional genius gumshoes were joined by former San Francisco detective Adrian Monk (Tony Shalhoub) in the summer of 2002, and he is indeed a welcome addition. Cable channel USA Network introducedMonk, a bright comedy-drama series about an obsessive-compulsive sleuth drummed out of police work following the murder of his wife and a subsequent spike in his overwhelming neuroses. Once a rising star in the homicide department, the twitchy savant is still valuable to Captain Stottlemeyer (Ted Levine), who reluctantly calls on Monk to solve difficult, high-profile murders of judges, billionaires, police informants, and famous attorneys. Monk's talent for finding clues and seeing the big picture in criminal investigations makes him a force to reckon with, but his many phobias (germs, heights, asymmetry, and much, much else) aggravate Stottlemeyer and make Monk completely dependent on a long-suffering assistant, Sharona (Bitty Schram), a single mom who functions as Dr. Watson to Monk's Sherlock Holmes.Each of the 12 episodes included inMonk: The Complete First Seasonis a delightful mix of clever whodunit puzzler, neurotic schtick, and deepening relationships. Among the latter, the bond between Monk and Sharona is most touching, as the platonic friends, sometimes aghast at how involved they are in each other's lives, surprise themselves with the breadth of their trust and commitment. In \"Mr. Monk Goes to the Asylum,\" Monk is forced into a stay at a mental hospital, where a murderer has convinced him he's crazy; it's Sharona who makes her boss realize he's not. In \"Mr. Monk and the Earthquake,\" it's Monk who rushes to Sharona's aid when he deduces that a lying friend is about to kill her. In almost every episode, Monk is confronted with a phobic limitation he must overcome in order to save the day. The question is whether he will heal enough, one day, to re-join his old squad. For the sake ofMonk's winning formula and fans, one has to hope such good news never comes to pass.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B003YLM79E", "B003YLM794", "B000F0UUTG", "B000OHZKZ4", "B0081QF6WW", "B0081QF6QS", "B0081QF6LS", "B00005JLN6", "B002NTDXS2", "B000P0I4P8", "B004FM2EQC", "B004FM2EMQ", "B0052C5EHK", "B0052C5EI4", "B003L77H1E", "B00GTZWXYQ", "B0002COTDA", "B0025X4PAQ", "B003WVJ65Y", "B000FVQLIO", "B005PPMI00", "B001QE99AQ", "B00EQ2KU7G", "B00H4ZEJCO", "B000092T3Y", "B00BD6KETC", "B0024FAD8S", "B00DZP1C0O", "B0015RRNMA", "B00ESGGAYM", "B002N5N4NA", "B001C8W7EQ", "B000A0GY0K", "B000HT3P60", "B00FMR66J0", "B003F3NDWG", "B003L77FYS", "B0019Z3P84", "B00H4ZEJAG", "B00005JLEX", "B000BF0C8E", "B000056H2F", "B0001K5GOO", "B0081QF6Q8", "B00GOC74QG", "0451220994", "0451226984", "B0037XPPAM", "B00KHA9BQ2", "B0002CX21K", "B00GOYHPR2", "B00BUWD7NE", "B000ION72Q", "B000BOH8YG", "B000GG4Y28", "B00HV0TJM2", "B00005ATZT", "B001XRLWPQ", "B00I099K4U", "B00A2XQTVY", "0739472593", "B00005JLFT", "B0012EM5EW", "B000RO6JYK", "B000RBA6CO", "B000244FDW", "B004DCM5RC", "B003INBNV6", "B0007YXRCW", "B001D2WUDE", "B000LXGXY8", "B00GOC75YW", "B005TTEG5W", "B000BGR1B4", "B0000DFZ5O", "B0002XVQSU", "B001L1S1OY", "B003R0MF1W", "B0053O89KG", "B00005JNOG", "B00H57HOSC", "B00DCG3696", "B00004RBDU", "B001JFKWE4", "B00404ME2Y", "B000FVQLQQ", "B000R7GKQE", "B000N2HD6O", "B000NDEXK2", "B000CEPE5A", "B001DMVZLW", "B001992NWO", "B009RX7IX8", "B000CQM4YM", "B0045HCJRG", "B00BGI086Q", "B00EEDNR9A", "B00IWTVDUW", "B000ICLRKC", "B004HHX9H8"], "bought_together": ["B003YLM79E", "B003YLM794"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003YLM79E", "B003WVJ65Y", "B000F0UUTG", "B003YLM794"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 57400}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 12.82, "brand": "Universal Studios", "asin": "B0001KL5IU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/519P5BM473L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Monk - Season One"}
{"description": "The key players in the radical movement known as the Weather Underground are skillfully brought to life in this Oscar-nominated documentary. The Weathermen were born of sixties protest, but took their scheme to overthrow the U.S. government to especially violent extremes. Never a well-populated movement, the Underground petered out as its leaders aged during the seventies; by decade's end, weary of hiding, most of them had turned themselves over to the authorities. That journey, by which a fire-breathing revolutionary such as Bernadine Dohrn became a (still fiery) gray-haired wife and mother, is an intriguing one. This film, rich in period footage (and some unnecessary sensationalism) captures the era somewhat broadly. But the present-day interviews with the participants, contrasted with their radical selves, provides an exceptionally detailed look inside the organization itself. It's not a nostalgic look back, and the overall mood is sobering rather than celebratory. Lili Taylor provides the narration.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00006JMQC", "B0000DI87X", "006147276X", "0061472751", "B000OCY668", "B00AZD47GA", "B005NHZAHS", "0807032778", "B000BKSITY", "1484058879", "B0001L3LUE", "0520241193", "B004AR4VRW", "B001QUF3SW", "1904859410", "B00K1BFRGK", "B00GMM19KA", "B000LP5CX4", "B00BEIYKX0", "B001AXU1FA", "B0030Y1282", "B00026L9CU", "B00GMM19M8", "B000BNXD6E", "B005HI4LLO", "B00IVLRC6K", "B00329PYGQ", "B000ZDQI44", "B0000SXK0Y", "B000055WFW", "B000ADWDG6", "B000IB0DE4", "B00D3LA7H4", "B00A92MGLA", "B000NIVJH2", "0195104579", "B000ELL1R6", "B000O75GWQ", "1604863196", "B000YDOOSM", "1583227261", "B0031WNYHK", "B00006673L", "B000KLQUUS", "B000QJLQE4", "B00ARWXJ54", "B003Z3CZGG", "B0002V7ON8", "B0000DIJOO", "B0053YS9XI", "B00007ELEK", "0520247094", "1594290350", "B0001FVDI2", "1894925157", "B000OCY7JO", "B00DPUB5LK", "B00007CVSP", "B003Y5H4R0", "B000E5LEVU", "B001IB2ZBC", "1481927663", "B00HRJVHEK", "B0042KZJIC", "B00AZMFG48", "B000A88ES2", "B0041KKYBA", "B004QL7JYO", "B003EYEEI8", "0143123874", "079284646X", "B007T40GPO", "B009A26AWQ", "B008H6GHKG", "B000O75GX0", "0226493660", "B001MFNB5I", "1590799755", "B007XW07CO", "B00005JKF6", "B002CSC5EC"], "bought_together": ["B00006JMQC", "B0000DI87X"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00740HHMI", "B000CCSAPI", "B00AZD47GA", "B0000DI87X"]}, "price": 17.08, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 49097}, "asin": "B0001LYFKO", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51aLr4PytxL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Weather Underground"}
{"description": "Season 3 ofCheersenriched television history in a lot of ways, most notably by introducing Kelsey Grammer as psychiatrist Frasier Crane while also bidding an off-screen farewell to Nicholas Colasanto, the actor who played Coach. (Colasanto died near the end of the season, and while Coach's character was kept alive via outtakes for remaining episodes, he essentially disappeared fromCheersbefore the commencement of year 4.)Grammer's beloved character, who remained on NBC for 20 unbroken years (including the long-runningFrasier), is ushered into theCheersfamily when he meets barmaid Diane Chambers (Shelley Long) in a very funny, Emmy-nominated episode suggesting the neurotic course of their future romance. Meanwhile, Sam (Ted Danson), having fallen off the wagon due to his own tempestuous love affair with Diane, has to endure Frasier's questions about how to be intimate with the brainy babe.

{"description": "The Dukes of Hazzardwas part of America's redneck fetish in the mid-to-late 1970s, otherwise evident in popular songs, movies, and television shows highlighting fast cars, truckers, citizens' band radio, moonshine, irreverent hicks, and clueless lawmen. Created by writer-producer Gy Waldron and inspired by his own 1975 bootlegging comedy,Moonrunners,Dukesmilked seven seasons of material from the tale of a Deep South family of reformed whiskey-makers and their running feud with a greedy impresario and his chief lackey, a buffoonish, venal sheriff.This three-disc set includes all 13 initial episodes ofDukesfrom 1979, a period fans fondly recall because some of the programs were shot on location in Covington, Georgia, rather than a Burbank backlot. Also noteworthy is that a couple of key characters, particularly Hazzard County's corrupt lawman, Roscoe P. Coltrane (James Best), hadn't gelled yet into permanent hayseed stereotypes and were arguably more interesting at the beginning. At the center of the action is Sheriff Coltrane's nemeses, cousins Bo Duke (John Schneider) and Luke Duke (Tom Wopat), a couple of wild boys buzzing through the backwoods in the \"General Lee,\" a souped-up Dodge Charger. Bo and Luke are good at heart but have to behave themselves while on indefinite probation, complicating but not halting their efforts to vex Roscoe and his patron, diminutive bigwig Boss Hogg (Sorrell Booke). The enmity runs both ways: Roscoe and Boss Hogg, with the aid of witless Deputy Enos Strate (Sonny Shroyer), dream up ways of eliminating the Dukes--including their wise old Uncle Jesse (Denver Pyle)--but their efforts always backfire.While every episode is a variation on the previous one, predictability is a virtue inDukes. The series pilot, \"One Armed Bandits,\" finds Luke and Bo, with help from their sexy cousin, Daisy (Catherine Bach), diverting slot machines (smuggled into Hazzard County by Roscoe and Boss Hogg) to sundry watering holes where they can raise money for Bo's girlfriend's charity. In \"Money to Burn,\" Boss Hogg tries to frame Bo and Luke for robbing an armored truck, while in \"Deputy Dukes,\" the unarmed guys are forced by Roscoe to escort a deadly prisoner from one town to another. The Dukes hit back in \"Daisy's Song,\" investigating a scam that took Daisy for $50 and implicates, of course, Boss Hogg and Roscoe.Yes, it's a show about rubes, car stunts, and a legacy of moonshine, but there's something comforting about it, in a tongue-in-cheek way.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0006BAWR4", "B0007XG26G", "B0009S4IM4", "B000BB1MJ6", "B000HLDF9U", "B000EMG90O", "B0014VPFM2", "B000L4WWJM", "B002Q6QBI6", "B000BB8VM2", "B000M7FOO8", "B007A2Z19G", "B000BKJ758", "B000HQ4GWA", "B004MTTZIS", "B005KL76BK", "B001J0FVYK", "B000H3BSY2", "B001G4S5SI", "B005KL6VH0", "B0045DO8E2", "B004GF9W0O", "B002F1R6KY", "B000EQHXOG", "B003VRJ89S", "B0036ELHOK", "B000AARQI4", "B00029XHZ4", "B007KW5M6I", "B00JQNFRF0", "B000BUE5CI", "B000E5KQLY", "B0007LXP7W", "B0024FAD7Y", "B001PU8MY0", "B00008O38I", "B0010VZ91I", "B00FWMVVJ0", "B00H4DV4ZG", "B00BUWD7NE", "B00005BQW5", "B001BN4WHW", "031235374X", "B001G4ZG1C", "B008WAM2DI", "B00BCNXOWA", "B0002W4SWW", "B000GW8U9U", "B000SQFC2M", "B000002PGD", "B0035QQEYM", "B00GHX0JUU", "B0006IUDXA", "B0007OCG74", "B00005JO4F", "B000LUORB2", "B000AMCW4K", "B000EXZFS0", "B000CELOV8", "B0006N2F0E", "B00GX7D5JW", "B000HEZEYG", "B000B7HZUK", "B003H9LIRK", "B00COHGPD8", "B004UV3KS4", "B00HVFA36I", "B0002I837M", "B0000VD11E", "B005LAIH9A", "B00076ONT6", "B0000V4906", "B002N57KG2", "B00005JM3A", "B0050MB5AC", "B001BN4WK4", "B002XGZTRI", "B00005JLR2", "B003BGZ61S", "B00DJYK1XU", "B000TZI2FQ", "B00D2UMHB0", "B000UX6TL6", "B00DYQ1GBE", "B00B39FGIS", "B000G2OYZE", "B001DSNELU", "B001DSNEME", "B00005JOHC", "B007XF0WXA", "B000291Q3Y", "B00005JMQW", "B00009QG5P", "B00IN69P0E", "B00IMENO9K", "B006ZL1P84", "B00GOC75YW", "B00DXLO086", "B000EBGFQI", "B00JDCP0QA"], "bought_together": ["B0006BAWR4", "B0007XG26G"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0006BAWR4", "B000HLDF9U", "B0014VPFM2", "B0007XG26G"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 24764}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 29.99, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B0001WTWXI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61hPa5VJdAL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Dukes of Hazzard: Season 1"}

{"description": "DidThundercatsproducers Rankin/Bass ever consider that their '80s animated adventure series would become such a pop-culture touchstone decades later, with hip-hop artists dropping references to the show in the songs and comedians using Lion-O as a punchline? Probably not, but it certainly accounts for this massive second volume of episodes culled from the series' first season. Wherevolume 1's episodes focused on the Thundercats' escape from home planet Thundera, arrival on Third Earth, and struggle against Mumm-Ra and his mutant army with the help of the Sword of Omens, volume 2's 32 episodes focus on a series of challenges Lion-O must face in order to become the Lord of the Thundercats. Said trials pit the leader-in-training against his own compatriots: Lion-O must best Panthro in a strength challenge (\"Trial of Strength\"), outrace Cheetara (\"The Trial of Speed\"), make his way through a maze devised by WilyKit and WilyKat (\"Trial of Cunning\"), outwit Tygra in a battle of illusions (\"The Trial of Mind Power\"), and, finally, take on his deadliest foe, Mumm-Ra (\"The Trial of Evil\"). Of course, there are plenty of other colorful villains on hand to give Lion-O and his companions pause throughout the season, including appearances by hunter Safari Joe (\"Fond Memories\"), mutant robot the Driller (\"Mechanical Plague\"), and newcomers the Ice King (\"Secret of the Ice King\"), and the tiny terrors the Micrits (\"The Micrits\"), among numerous others. The episodes are spread over six discs, and are rounded out by a featurette on Thundercats' long-lasting appeal, which includes an interview with executive producer Arthur Rankin Jr.--Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000E8JNRO", "B0009IW8AI", "B000HEWEFI", "B001BN25VW", "B005G7WGLS", "B004DTU2X4", "B005SYZZ62", "B0089AGGW4", "B00782O82Y", "B0058KGHXG", "B000HC2LRG", "B000SM7R2O", "B000WGWZX2", "B001OBBR38", "B003Q7B7A6", "B001GF8WRG", "B004NJC0JI", "B004W6KGUW", "B004UFHHCK", "B002DH20Q0", "B004UFHD8I", "B004RA7XZE", "B004HI79LO", "B001B8TKFG", "B004W6KHM4", "B005EKWZD6", "B001UNSZ8U", "B002DQL34G", "B004W6KHMY", "B005N50VRE", "B00466X70Y", "B004UFDMII", "B006TSI63A", "B000IU37T8", "B001U9BS38", "B008XJM6H0", "B000MKYK2M", "B00AQ590KU", "B0053H8Y80", "B0042I6528", "B003VMFX4W", "B002NN7EX8", "B002WIDRKS", "B006VWVB2C", "B004UFHE50", "B0055UA1KO", "B003CS28UC", "B00198X0YA", "B006MR3EIA", "B00DIG95H2", "B002JYPVRM", "B008Q12YH2", "B005OZJVE2", "B006MR3F2K", "B001N6FPQY", "B0002W4SY0", "B000M2E3FO", "B000ATQYVA", "B0077T5SN6", "B0029PUUSQ", "B0031L5CJE", "B002D755BW", "B000F5GO5U", "B000OY9V7A", "630016411X", "B0036EH3XY", "B000G1R39Y", "B000H5U65W", "B0066E6T8G", "B004UF9R46", "B004ZKKL14", "B002ZFEQ4E", "B002DYKPFQ", "B004VT9JLC", "B001QIVEVE", "B0027WNRV8", "B00I099JZK", "B00I8OSDU4", "B005335K7W", "B001SLNPTI", "B001U7NVYO", "B00F3L8OQS", "B0031L5CJO", "B00ERH1718", "B004W6KGB6", "B00553KAK2", "B0087AOYCU", "B001U7NVYY", "B007VX0QKI", "B00CM0DIT6", "B004W6KG4S", "B00GSTHDCU", "B002DYKPF6", "B006FLYWQG", "B000EHSVG4", "B000V1Y450", "B002LYD2L2", "B003RACHA6", "B0001HAI0E", "B003CNQPOM"], "bought_together": ["B0009IW8AI", "B000HEWEFI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0009IW8AI", "B000HEWEFI", "B000E8JNRO", "B001BN25VW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 24977}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 27.81, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00029QQQG", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51B24QHCWAL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Thundercats - Season One, Volume Two"}

{"description": "As the fourth season ofAngelstarts, everything is still as we left it: Angel has been sunk to the bottom of the sea in an iron box by his inexplicable and vindictive son Connor and Cordelia has been summoned to higher realms to await orders. Gunn and Fred are left in the Hyperion Hotel, unsure about what has happened to their friends, and Lilah is working hard to seduce Wesley to the dark side. In the first few episodes, some of this is resolved but it's almost immediately replaced by far worse crises: prophesies of doom accumulate more rapidly even than usual in this wonderfully gloomy show and a horned rock-like beast rains fire on Los Angeles. This last year isAngel's most tightly dramatic season yet--with a story arc of surprising intensity punctuated by the show's usual wit and sexiness.Season 4 is presented on DVD in Dolby 2.0 Surround Sound and anamorphic widescreen. It comes with insightful, and often hilarious, commentaries on seven of the 22 episodes as well as featurettes--a series overview, profiles of the characters of Jasmine and the Beast, a farewell to the Hyperion Hotel (the characters' base for three seasons), and a discussion of the apocalypse that Angel has to deal with from episode 7 onwards).--Roz Kaveney", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000I0QLS2", "B000I0QLRI", "B000I0QLR8", "B000I0QLQY", "B000EHSVN2", "B000EHSVMS", "B000EHSVM8", "B000EHSVLY", "B000EHSVLE", "B000EHSVL4", "B000EHSVKK", "B0006IUE16", "B0009W5J4Q", "B007H9CNOI", "B000CCBCGM", "B0024FAR66", "B000B5XOW0", "B0046XG48O", "B000OIOPHC", "B000JLTRIG", "B000RO6JYK", "B001992NWO", "B000ERVJM2", "B00AMDA2QC", "B00006J3WH", "B001L1S1OY", "B002JVWR4A", "1593078226", "B000HT3P60", "B0053O89IS", "B002JVWR4U", "B000GG4Y6O", "B009LDCXNY", "B00HUPC5X8", "B0000AQS0F", "B000BOH990", "B00JF5GAZA", "B009LDD4V4", "B000FP2OPY", "B000X5SPBI", "B000HD1482", "B002CLKP00", "B003L77G8I", "B00133QNSG", "B002JVWRAO", "B000N6SE4U", "B000G1R4SO", "159307784X", "B000T9OP7G", "B0011FLGZQ", "B000QDLSR0", "B003L77GGK", "B00008KA57", "B006LG74Q0", "B000FIMG68", "B00001R3O1", "B0009JE6FC", "B001MVWRMU", "1569717516", "B001FB4W0C", "B009LDCWWG", "B002N5N5MK", "B001B7CNZ6", "1595826106", "B000NOKFGW", "B000F8O2PG", "B0001JXPPC", "B000O77SMW", "B00020H9NO", "B000R7GKQE", "B005X4P3DC", "B0085KGG96", "B003BV8I7C", "B004YM6JI2", "B00006FD9N", "B000BOH98G", "0785168370", "B000PMFRTC", "B001M5UDGS", "B000CNE0SS", "1613770596", "1593078269", "B00133QNS6", "B00IWTVDUW", "B001MVWRN4", "B00243FQFA", "B000A5045Q", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B001MVWRMK", "B0008FPJ7Q", "B00BBXSPES", "B001AQO43M", "B0024FAD9C", "B000BOH986", "159307963X", "B00133QNRW", "B003L77GH4", "B000GG4Y28", "B002XD0J80", "B00008KGT0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000I0QLRI", "B000I0QLR8", "B000I0QLQY", "B000I0QLS2"]}, "price": 1.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 165905}, "asin": "B0002HS74C", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51PP1E7PZZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Angel - Season Four"}

{"description": "Launched during the neon-lit 1980s,The Golden Girlsshed light on a side of Miami ignored byMiami Vice. In other words, no drugs, no murder--just four women of \"a certain age,\" spending their golden years in the sun. Like the theme, \"Thank You for Being a Friend,\" the long-running sitcom was about friendship (not crime). As for the \"girls,\" they were tart-tongued Dorothy (Beatrice Arthur), former farm girl Rose (Betty White), Southern belle Blanche (Rue McClanahan), and Dorothy's salty Sicilian mother Sophia (Estelle Getty). All were widows, with the exception of the divorced Dorothy.  Created by Emmy-winning producer Susan Harris (Soap),The Golden Girlsre-ignited the careers of 1970s TV veterans Arthur (All in the Family,Maude) and White (The Mary Tyler Moore Show). At the same time, it made stars of McClanahan (who co-starred onMaude), by playing a comic version ofA Streetcar Named Desire's Blanche Dubois, and the scene-stealing Getty, made to look older than her actual age (she and Arthur were born the same year).Notable guests to lend their talents to the first season includeStar Trek: Voyager's Robert Picardo (\"The Operation\"),Alice's Polly Holliday (\"Blind Ambitions\"), andWKRP in Cincinnati's Gordon Jump (\"Big Daddy\"). In addition, Harold Gould (Rhoda), who appears in \"Rose the Prude,\" would return as a (different) recurring character five years later.The Golden Girlsran for seven seasons and spawned spin-offThe Golden Palace(without Arthur) and a British version calledThe Brighton Belles. By the end of its run in 1992, it had garnered numerous awards, including two Emmys for best comedy series. In addition, each of the four actresses received a well-deserved Emmy for her efforts.--Kathleen C.

{"description": "Portly, mincing, gracious, and unrelenting, Hercule Poirot rivals Sherlock Holmes as the greatest sleuth of the English murder mystery genre--a form as strict as a sonnet that's part logic puzzle, part magician's misdirection, of which Agatha Christie remains the undisputed queen.The New Mysteries Collectionpulls together TV-movie adaptations of four Poirot novels, each a compendium of eccentric characters, intricate plotting, sleek storytelling, and sprinklings of wit (such as a dotty matriarch's declaration, \"Murder is a very awkward thing--it upsets the servants so\").Death on the Nilesets an entire boatful of suspicious character afloat in Egypt, where Poirot's vacation is disrupted by a splash in the night, falling rock, missing pearls, three murders, and a boozing gargoyle named Salome Otterbourne. The plot is one of Christie's more preposterous, yet also one of her most popular.Sad Cypressopens with a murderess on trial, then flashes back to young lovers, a wealthy but stricken dowager, a spiteful anonymous letter, and a pretty young blonde.  A wonderfully creepy dream haunts Poirot as he struggles to redeem the wrongly convicted killer. InThe Hollow, Poirot's vacation in the English countryside gets disrupted by a philandering doctor apparently shot by his adoring wife, his blood trickling into a swimming pool clotted with leaves. But the best of the lot isFive Little Pigs, a story told almost entirely in flashback, as a young woman hires Poirot to clear her mother, who was convicted of murdering her father. Not only are the clues deftly planted and the solution cunningly worked out, it's one of the rare mysteries that inspires a genuine sorrow for its characters.Scattered throughout are a wealth of recognizable faces, though not many recognizable names--among the better known are James Fox (The Remains of the Day), Edward Fox (The Day of the Jackal), Paul McGann (Withnail and I), Sarah Miles (White Mischief), Lysette Anthony (Husbands and Wives), and David Soul (Starsky & Hutch!). But it's David Suchet as Poirot who keeps everything in motion, his beady eyes glittering under heavy lids, constantly tending to one of the most ridiculous mustaches in literature. Poirot has been played by such stars as Peter Ustinov and Albert Finney, but Suchet has made the fastidious Belgian detective his own. He's simplymagnifique.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000CRR3EC", "B002FU8J10", "B001V7YZAM", "B004WMOSNM", "B0028AENVC", "B007ISJS0U", "B005X5XINI", "B006JY3O2M", "B0083HXKM2", "B005X5XI4C", "B00GWXI16O", "B006Z4LP9K", "B000068QOE", "B000CRR36K", "B001V7YZA2", "B000068UE9", "B00GWXI0S8", "B001V7YZAC", "B00D7AM2V0", "B001V7YZ9S", "B001KP2J3U", "B002MUAXJY", "B00AEFYO5I", "B00005KH4B", "B00DW5IKWK", "B000GB5M1A", "B00EF0NYVI", "B00GWXHYPI", "B001UWOLQG", "0767028627", "B0006HBJJ8", "B0007Y3XRG", "B00005QBZL", "B000068QOB", "B008N8A3DA", "B004VLYHNA", "B000R349JI", "B003L80FLC", "B000GAKFIG", "B001KZOVJK", "B00GWXI2RM", "B00GHH9I62", "B009D4RW96", "1569383618", "B0090XLDO0", "B0023Y543Y", "B008CYDE7C", "B009DS5OEM", "B007T40GOK", "B00AO1RKFS", "B00GAHG7PE", "B004HJ0ZLE", "B005DVIPY4", "B00A0HT99G", "B00GAHJO8G", "B003YCI238", "B00A27O5AW", "B00C12ZISE", "B000056C0I", "B00GWXI2MC", "B000068QJV", "B00BDSRM4K", "B00JJRLFTU", "B0001WTUK8", "B009DS6YGO", "B000GB5M1U", "B001KP2J44", "B00A8KJLPM", "B00023P44M", "B00068RYZK", "B001RPPJSK", "B001KP2J3K", "B003AND1TG", "B00005BGSB", "B00009PY1O", "B00GAXASLC", "B001RPO3FU", "1569385882", "B004HHX9H8", "B0056031NW", "B00GWXI20E", "B00C888LOO", "B00H4ZEFTQ", "B000062XDX", "B00HYZ10RQ", "B003YCI1UC", "B009D4SFEC", "B00016XNFW", "B000YDMPCO", "B001O4C6NA", "B004WMOSIC", "B0047CG95W", "B000CRR3CE", "B00005U8F2", "B00005MM5H", "B000065AYI", "B00004VVMZ", "B002MUAXJ4", "B0000V4726", "B002G3DTSE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004HJ0ZLE", "B00DW5IKWK", "B004WMOSNM", "B001KP2J3U"]}, "price": 39.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 112453}, "asin": "B0006212JK", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51B3Z135V8L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Poirot - The New Mysteries Collection (Death on the Nile / Sad Cypress / The Hollow / Five Little Pigs)"}

{"description": "Submitted for your approval:The Twilight Zone's inaugural season, all 36 episodes complete with Rod Serling's original promos for the following week's episode, not seen since their original broadcast. To discuss television's greatest anthology series whose title has become pop culture shorthand for the bizarre and supernatural is to immediately become like Albert Brooks and Dan Aykroyd inTwilight Zone: The Movie; a can-you-top-this recall of famous shocks and favorite twists. Several essential episodes hail from this season, among them, \"Time Enough at Last\" starring Burgess Meredith as a bespectacled bookworm who is the lone survivor of an atomic blast; \"The After-Hours\" starring Anne Francis as a department store shopper haunted by mannequins; and the profoundly disturbing \"The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street,\" in which fear and prejudice turns neighbor against neighbor (and, by the by, whose alien observers inspired Kang and Kodos onThe Simpsons).From an unsettlingly persistent hitchhiker to a malevolent slot machine,The Twilight Zone's first season did plumb \"the pit of man's fears.\" One forgets how moving the series could be. Three of this season's most memorable and enduring episodes are the poignant and primal \"stop-the-world-I-want-to-get-off fantasies, \"Walking Distance,\" \"A Stop at Willougby\" and \"The Sixteen-Millimeter Shrine,\" in which desperate characters seek refuge in a simpler past. Serling's few stabs at comedy (\"Mr. Bevis,\" \"The Mighty Casey\") have not aged well, but the series finale, \"A World of His Own,\" starring Keenan Wynn as a playwright whose fictional characters come to life, has a brilliant capper. The episodes are more deliberately paced than one might remember. Less patient younger viewers might be anxious to get to the payoffs, but once they settle into the rhythm, they will savor the literate writing and the performances by such veteran actors as Ed Wynn, Everett Sloan, and Ida Lupino, and newcomers such as Jack Klugman. The extras, including the unaired version of the pilot episode, \"Where is Everybody?\", audio commentaries and recollections, and a Serling college lecture, truly take this six-disc set to another dimension.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00BQK4YDC", "B00C6F61S2", "B000BC8T1E", "B00CPTUN8S", "B000AL733G", "B000AYEIIQ", "B00068NVLQ", "B0002CX1M0", "B0002J4ZX2", "B001DXS4DI", "B000HDR814", "B002NPY7GS", "B006TBYC76", "1879505096", "B000VDDDY6", "B0000DC3VM", "B000UAE7VS", "B0007Y08P6", "B00005JOJE", "B00092ZLDK", "B0009UC7MK", "B0007Y08RY", "B000O59A52", "B00198X0YK", "B00007ELE6", "B001DHXT3Y", "B00269PU2G", "B000LC4ZIA", "B000GETUDI", "B006TTC5A4", "B00H4KQN82", "B002TSAAS8", "B005UL4NF2", "B001E6HUWK", "B000BITV1A", "B001LM64VK", "B00JEZWRE4", "B003NOGNQU", "B0017VG69U", "B001DB6J50", "B00005N5RM", "B000062XFG", "B00133QNSG", "B000N2HD6O", "B000CCBCD0", "B001G0MFLU", "B00005LC4K", "B000Z6GT1I", "B000TXPXD2", "B000HWZ4HU", "B000SSQ7JW", "B000IHYXJO", "B00005Y1NF", "B000H5U5EE", "B008L36520", "B005LVIP1E", "B0019F030M", "B001AQO43M", "B000TJBNF8", "B0019PL2JI", "B000063V8S", "B000B7HZUK", "B001992NZG", "B0002WZTLQ", "B0000714AP", "B00D97DMQU", "B00D9EJFZA", "B000CNE0TC", "B005E7SEOI", "B00009VRF0", "B000HEZEYG", "B003CN5B7E", "B004FECNJ8", "B000MGBSH6", "B000F48D0U", "B00005JLRT", "B000TLTCT0", "B003L77G7Y", "B007KFZ85K", "B002GSXKQA", "B0040NFQ0W", "B001RIZ7OI", "B0089LT7ZG", "B000ASDFIQ", "B0007Y08LK", "B000T9OP7G", "B000BF0C8E", "B001JFKWE4", "B00A2L1CKO", "B00DZP1C9K", "0783240961", "B00871C09S", "B001GUYAZY", "B000FA57U8", "B000QQJ3Q0", "B0000VD04M", "B000BGR1B4", "B00ANGIAU8", "B000GW8UAE", "B0001WTWS8"], "bought_together": ["B00BQK4YDC", "B00C6F61S2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000H5U5EE", "B00BQK4YDC", "B00C6F61S2", "B00D9EJG2M"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 107871}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 42.09, "brand": "Image Entertainment", "asin": "B00068NVMK", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51EzHtftO7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Twilight Zone - Season 1 (The Definitive Edition)"}

{"description": "The remarkable first season ofDeadwoodrepresents one of those periodic, wholesale reinventions of the Western that is as different from, say,Lonesome Doveas that miniseries is from Howard Hawks'sRio Bravoor the latter is from Anthony Mann'sThe Naked Spur. In many ways, HBO'sDeadwoodembraces the Western's unambiguous morality during the cinema's silent era through the 1930s while also blazing trails through a post-NYPD Blue, post-The West Wingtelevision age exalting dense and customized dialogue. On top of that,Deadwoodhas managed an original look and texture for a familiar genre: gritty, chaotic, and surging with both dark and hopeful energy. Yet the show's creator, erstwhileNYPD Bluehead writer David Milch, never ridicules or condescends to his more grasping, futile characters or overstates the virtues of his heroic ones.Set in an ungoverned stretch of South Dakota soon after the 1876 Custer massacre,Deadwoodconcerns a lawless, evolving town attracting fortune-seekers, drifters, tyrants, and burned-out adventurers searching for a card game and a place to die. Others, particularly women trapped in prostitution, sundry do-gooders, and hangers-on have nowhere else to go. Into this pool of aspiration and nightmare arrive former Montana lawman Seth Bullock (Timothy Olyphant) and his friend Sol Starr (John Hawkes), determined to open a lucrative hardware business. Over time, their paths cross with a weary but still formidable Wild Bill Hickok (Keith Carradine) and his doting companion, the coarse angel Calamity Jane (Robin Weigert); an aristocratic, drug-addicted widow (Molly Parker) trying to salvage a gold mining claim; and a despondent hooker (Paula Malcomson) who cares, briefly, for an orphaned girl. Casting a giant shadow over all is a blood-soaked king, Gem Saloon owner Al Swearengen (Ian McShane), possibly the best, most complex, and mesmerizing villain seen on TV in years.  Over 12 episodes, each of these characters, and many others, will forge alliances and feuds, cope with disasters (such as smallpox), and move--almost invisibly but inexorably--toward some semblance of order and common cause. Making it all worthwhile is Milch's masterful dialogue--often profane, sometimes courtly and civilized, never perfunctory--and the brilliant acting of the aforementioned performers plus Brad Dourif, Leon Rippy, Powers Boothe, and Kim Dickens.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000EULSR0", "B000NVI2GU", "B0038M2APA", "B0075FF5QM", "B007A2Z3Y4", "B00B5J6A7W", "B004HW7JNS", "B00CG4XKNM", "B004BZ5AHI", "B00EAPC860", "B00HUCF420", "B00A2JOQMW", "B003Y5HWJU", "B008PJZDXW", "B0028RXXE8", "B00076YPUI", "B00HT850YW", "B00CDTSFF8", "B00J5LXT44", "B00BFAIH68", "B00G4RDQK4", "B002UJIY7A", "1596912391", "B00BC5I6Q2", "B00316DDUO", "B00C8CQRQ4", "B00ECGHM5O", "B000K2V7E6", "B0090XO59U", "B00EIXWW2O", "B005LAJ1H2", "B00HW3EXCE", "B00EEDNR9A", "B0012RLX88", "B00EUI4XHE", "B004QRUN96", "B00J5G1P2W", "B00003CXOP", "B00AATGDUC", "B00IARA8KM", "B009LDD54K", "B000PGTPH8", "B008CLI4N4", "B008V9HKF0", "B00ATP24V4", "6305504024", "B002N57KGM", "B005HAAZLC", "B00G0B7PTW", "B001TH8ZH8", "B000059H7K", "080328702X", "B001FA1OTU", "B0051GOB2G", "B00BVMXBDO", "B0060MYKYY", "B00911L7VA", "B00BQ42Q38", "B00GWJIDFW", "B001DJLCRC", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B0002ERXC2", "B000VWX6T4", "B008BLCP0S", "B00FEP9MYG", "B00GAHJO8G", "B00793J278", "B0002J4X2K", "B00005JL3K", "B00J4LMHMK", "B000YABIQ6", "6304711905", "B0058YPG1G", "B001FB4W0W", "B003PIUBZS", "B00DJYJRHG", "B004HW7JO2", "B001RTSPVY", "B00HEPE6MM", "B00CL151G4", "B00005NOHO", "B0024FAR5M", "B00AYNG9BC", "B0032UYFA6", "B009ERK2UI", "B000BO7DWI", "B000F1IQI2", "B00915G6WQ", "B0081QF6Q8", "B00B5J5YJM", "B00IWTVDUW", "B006MK4QKW", "B00ECHBSP8", "B009LDD1H6", "B0012CJQYQ", "B00BGI076M", "B001GCUER0", "B002FLOTPE", "B005FISBTO", "B0032JTV6A"], "bought_together": ["B000EULSR0", "B000NVI2GU"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001FA1OTU", "B000EULSR0", "B0038M2APA", "B000NVI2GU"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 6874}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 34.99, "brand": "Warner Bros", "asin": "B0006FO5LO", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61KQUt8dAdL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Deadwood: Season 1"}

Not a happy place, obviously, and it gets worse when both men realize that they've been chained and pitted against one another by an unseen but apparently omniscient maniac who's screwing with their psyches as payment for past sins. Director James Wan, who concocted this grimy distraction with screenwriter Whannell, has seenSevenand any number of other arty existential-psycho-cat-and-mouse thrillers, so he's providedSawwith a little flash, a little blood, and a lot of ways to distract you from the fact that it doesn't make a whole hell of a lot of sense.

For the rest of the world,  this movie looks like a ground-level reckoning in a melodramatic key, with an authentic feel for battle lines as well as home front.Tae Guk Gifollows two brothers--one uneducated and forceful, the other intellectual and reserved--as they are united and then divided by the conflict. The broadly emotional story has some of the power of tales of the American Civil War, when family members found themselves on opposite sides of a battle. Director Kang Je-gyu , who made the lively female-assassin hitShiri, takes a blunt approach to the material (including aSaving Private Ryan-style framing device). And at 150 minutes, he has plenty of time for head-splitting, blood-spraying combat.

{"description": "Friends' penultimate season could well be called \"The One with All the Romantic Arcs.\" Phoebe meets Mike (Paul Rudd virtually joining the ensemble). Rachel attempts to \"move on\" from Ross with a rival co-worker (guest star Dermot Mulroney). Ross meets Charley (Aisha Tyler, welcome colorblind casting), a paleontologist with an intimidating roster of Nobel Prize-winners in her dating history (so, of course, she hooks up with Joey). Other storylines, including Chandler's transfer to Tulsa and Rachel's sudden lust for Joey, are not as compelling as previous seasons', and an indication that inspiration is flagging. But while one is hard-pressed to add any of these episodes to theFriendspantheon, what redeems the season are the grace notes: Phoebe channeling a New England WASP to impress Mike's parents (\"The One with Ross's Inappropriate Song\") or playing naughty girl to Ross's \"daddy\" (\"The One with the Lottery\"); Joey's confession that he doesn't get it when people punctuate the air with finger quotes (\"The One Where Emma Cries\"); and Chandler's discomfort (and ultimate revenge) as an audience member at a ranting feminist's one-woman show (\"The One with the Soap Opera Party\").On the guest star front,Friendswelcomes back Jon Lovitz, who reprises his character from the classic first-season episode, \"The One with the Stoned Guy\" in \"The One with the Blind Dates,\" and Hank Azaria as David the \"Science Guy\" who returns to complicate Phoebe's love life. Christina Applegate is a riot as \"Rachel's Other Sister,\" and it's surprising that NBC didn't go allSuddenly Susanon Freddie Prinz Jr. after his surprisingly funny stint in \"The One with the Male Nanny.\" Selma Blair is a seductive co-worker who makes a play for Chandler in \"The One with Christmas in Tulsa,\" and Jeff Goldblum portrays a master thespian who mistakes Joey's urge to urinate as method acting. ForFriendsfanatics, it's a coup to get the episodes complete and uncut as opposed to their commercial-laden syndicated counterparts. For more casual viewers, let's just say of this comparatively lackluster season (byFriends' own gold standards) that the show was on a break.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B003TNW03A", "B003TNW03K", "B0001AW066", "B003TNW030", "B0000C2IXN", "B0000844MI", "B003TNW04Y", "B000068CNX", "B005IA9JQI", "B003TNW02G", "B005MG8UNG", "B005IA9JRM", "B005IA9JQ8", "B00020HAWY", "B005IA9JVI", "B001BJARX4", "B00B1LKXPY", "B000ERVK5S", "B000T22PVG", "B000A7PKGW", "B000EBGFPY", "B008LCRA98", "B000HT3P7E", "B000GPIPTM", "B005SJGIV8", "B000AJJNI6", "B008LCRABQ", "B0007R4SWC", "B0019CSXAM", "B000KGGIL4", "B000GRUMQY", "B000TM1CKQ", "B000Q6GUW0", "B008LCRA7K", "B0009WFEEG", "B002BJGYTY", "B000VZADPQ", "B00005JNEQ", "B008LCRAC0", "B002BAW6I6", "B0002I84FS", "B000I2J6VE", "B000N6TYLW", "B000BNTM46", "B00005JLEX", "B002BJGYU8", "B002BJGYV2", "B0001ZMWXW", "B003L77G7E", "B000HT3P6U", "B000V86OKG", "B000G1R4SY", "B000EHSVN2", "B002BAW6HW", "B0024FAR6Q", "B000EHSVM8", "B000U1ZV1W", "B001VPJYZ0", "B0001907BW", "B008KZX7W0", "B0011UBDS6", "B0001CCXZW", "B002BJGYTO", "B001LRL4WY", "B001RXDM2C", "B003YLM79E", "B000NOKFH6", "B005IA9JSG", "B001DPHDBU", "B004EPZ0BG", "B0053O8AFK", "B000EBGFQI", "B00005JO9J", "B0007KTBJO", "B00005JOHC", "B003L77G8I", "B00A81MV3U", "B003ZK99NQ", "B003ZKBELG", "0767827686", "B00BUWD7Y8", "B0001NBNJ8", "B0012BS5XU", "B00BT1XCOU", "B000E8M0VA", "B000I2OSB2"], "bought_together": ["B003TNW03A", "B003TNW03K"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005IA9JSG", "B003TNW03K", "B005IA9JQI", "B000068CNX"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 27204}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 22.25, "brand": "Warner Brothers", "asin": "B0006ZM8M2", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51JAD4UlK8L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Friends: Season 9"}

{"description": "Sean Penn (looking rather Rupert Pupkin-like) is Samuel Bicke, whose life, circa 1974, has become unbearable. His wife (Naomi Watts) has left him, his dead-end sales job is killing him--even his best friend (Don Cheadle) has had enough. Bicke's a loser, but at least he's an honest one. Nixon, the epitome of dishonesty, becomes the locus of his rage, so Bicke devises a plan to eliminate him. Paul Schrader claims he finished writingTaxi Driverbefore the real-life Byck attempted to assassinate the president. Maybe so, but the similarities are hard to ignore (and \"Bickle\" sounds a lot like \"Byck\"). Niels Mueller (Tadpole) doesn't disguise the fact that his debut was inspired by the guy. IfThe Assassination of Richard Nixondoesn't hitTaxi Driver's (admittedly lofty) heights, it's still a discomfiting look at a man determined to leave his mark on the world, only to become a footnote.--Kathleen C.

{"description": "The Andy Griffith Showreturns on DVD with its complete second season, a five-disc collector&#x92;s set of 31 episodes more memorable than one of Aunt Bee&#x92;s \"kerosene cucumbers.\" Set in the small town of Mayberry, the television series (1960-1968) followed the hilarious antics of widower Sheriff Andy Taylor (Andy Griffith), his son Opie (Ron Howard), and Deputy Barney Fife (Don Knotts). It has achieved cult status as one of television&#x92;s most beloved sitcoms for its stellar cast, pristine comedy, and nostalgic charm. By season two, the series found its tone and tenor, proved by such classic episodes as \"The Pickle Story,\" \"The Manicurist,\" and \"Barney and the Choir.\" After viewers endure (or skip) Paramount&#x92;s half dozen promotional trailers at the beginning of disc one, they can bask in 13 hours of restored, uninterrupted, black and white television magic. The season&#x92;s parade of guest stars includes Barbara Eden, Buddy Ebsen, Alan Hale Jr., Bill Bixby, and Sterling Holloway. Whereas the first season&#x92;s DVD set was without bonus material, this collection features sponsor spots, original commercial advertisements (linked to individual episodes) where the show&#x92;s cast members promote brands such as \"Sanka\" coffee and \"Post\" breakfast cereals--a guaranteed smile.

{"description": "The film is set in France near the end of World War I in the deadly trenches of the Somme, in the gilded Parisien halls of power, and in the modest home of an indomitable provincial girl. It tells the story of this young woman's relentless, moving and sometimes comic search for her fiancC)e, who has disappeared. He is one of five French soldiers believed to have been court-martialed under mysterious circumstances and pushed out of an allied trench into an almost-certain death in no-man's land. What follows is an investigation into the arbitrary nature of secrecy, the absurdity of war, and the enduring passion, intuition and tenacity of the human heart.DVD Features:Audio CommentaryDeleted Scenes:With Director audio commentaryDocumentaries:Paris in the 20'sThe Zepplin ExplosionFeaturette:The Making of A Very Long EngagementTheatrical Trailer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001CIOCLC", "B0045NXMJE", "B004YCKKH8", "B000934FC2", "B00000K3TS", "B004SEUIXS", "B008H1Q3QY", "B00005JM48", "B002LE8MGW", "B00005JPX8", "B0000C9JFO", "B002VKB0M4", "B00EMAGJ68", "B000UVV26A", "B001THZAAI", "B0069UV0AY", "B000YPUFBA", "B002AG2NTI", "B0045NXMMQ", "B0087IT8FK", "B001AZJKKK", "B004ZG5EYC", "B000B58DHQ", "B00421IR5I", "B005V4X8PO", "B000063K0U", "B00BTYJYR6", "B007I1Q59E", "B000I6BJ56", "B00000F7E6", "B00A92MEJY", "B0042FDCR2", "B000HIVIQU", "B009CSVQ8Q", "B000811672", "0312424582", "B0019UGYAU", "B0009P7EI2", "B00275EHVE", "B005E7SEK2", "B00EV1YZKK", "B004B3254Q", "B002BWP3UC", "B003VA3JTA", "B001M72J68", "B0002S64SM", "B000GBEWP2", "B0080QOL6A", "B000BB18WC", "B000OVLBGC", "B009B8YMB0", "B0036TGSJE", "B000LW7L2M", "B00DPJEWDO", "0792841409", "B00GS08Y3Q", "B000B9EYFW", "B0002ZMJD4", "B00068S3QY", "B00K0MM4AM", "B004YCKKIM", "B000SSQ7JC", "B0051HCVEU", "B005MYEQ4U", "B00005B1WH", "B00003CWTI", "B001JV5BA8", "B0031REQKE", "B00007J5VT", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B003J7HO6E", "B00GPPXNIK", "B002WY65VA", "B004XVMCG2", "B000YDMPAQ", "B00EV1YZQE", "B004SIP6BI", "B000HWZ4I4", "B00AZNEVNE", "B0001I54QQ", "B001CITQWC", "B00AZNEVJ8", "B00GX7WUD4", "B000KGGJ0Y", "B000H5V8H2", "B00ARX2VZW", "B00INUK5WM", "B00009OOFG", "B00F6SHGF8", "B00ENMZK1A", "B0011FDVGI", "B009TT0BSE", "B000CBG5PG", "B0014FAIZC", "B0046YK4KW", "B000N3T0DW", "B004EI2NUO", "B00003CXXY", "B004UXUUDA", "B002U1LGSW"], "bought_together": ["B001CIOCLC", "B004SEUIXS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001CIOCLC", "B004SEUIXS", "B0000C9JFO", "B00005JPX8"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 18840}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.74, "brand": "Warner Brothers", "asin": "B0007Z0NYQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51uMf%2BoLZPL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "A Very Long Engagement"}

{"description": "Lois & Clarkwas one of the sweetest surprises of the 1993 television season, and while it certainly enjoyed a devoted following until the series jumped the tall building in its later years, we can probably thank the Phoenix-like rise ofDesperate Housewives' Teri Hatcher's career to thank for its arrival on DVD. The premise ofLois & Clarkis one fraught with peril, particularly for core fans. This incarnation of the Man of Steel saga recastsSupermanas romantic comedy. One of the series creators once described this series as \"basically,Moonlighting, only Bruce Willis can fly.\" This is overstating the case by leaps and bounds. Clark Kent (Dean Cain) has not been reinvented as a wisecracking street-wise hipster. The chemistry between the new Metropolis arrival and rookieDaily Planetscribe and ace investigative reporter Lois Lane (Hatcher) is not as sexually charged as David and Maddie, and their banter is not as sharp. But as withMoonlightingit would be a few seasons before the two lovelorn characters consummated their attraction.The dramatic arc of this inaugural season is \"the fall of the house of Luthor,\" but at its heart is the triangle between Clark, Lois, and the charming snake Lex Luthor (John Shea), who, in the pilot episode, Superman vows to bring to justice (\"Let the games begin,\" Luthor responds). Further complicating matters is that Superman has literally swept Lois off her feet. But until the episode \"Barbarians at the Planet,\" in which Lex proposes to Lois, Lois professes her love to Superman, and Clark confesses his love to Lois,Lois & Clarkbreezily tweaks the touchstones ofSupermaniconography. \"I've never noticed it before,\" a \"drunk with love\" Lois observes to a bespectacled Clark in \"Pheremone, My Lovely,\" \"You look a lot like Superman.\" Though special effects have progressed since the 1990s,Lois & Clarkhas lost little of its sparkle and panache, thanks to its super leads, whose fledgling careers soared to dizzying new heights.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000BT96EG", "B00BBXSPES", "B00BBXSPCK", "B000EU1Q2M", "B00AKK6MD4", "B004EXWGJW", "B000HWZ4E8", "B00LT1JHLW", "B000I8OM94", "B00G7QPX6C", "B00DX88IL4", "B000EU1Q3Q", "B000A5046K", "B001FB4VZS", "B0002Y0QV2", "B00005JLKB", "B000X5SMXY", "B000G1R4SO", "B002JVWRDQ", "B000BT96FA", "B0001JXPPC", "B000N6SE4U", "B003L77GG0", "B0009A5MUO", "B000J10EQU", "B001FB4W02", "B003L77GGA", "B002JVWRE0", "B000SMNL92", "B000OPODNQ", "B0000C237S", "B002K0WBDM", "B000ION23U", "B0012U7IWU", "B005G5NPD8", "B000093W4T", "B000A2X3T8", "B002LWJ510", "B00HFWETQW", "B000P6XQ50", "B001MVWRNE", "B000B7QCGS", "B002LFPBKQ", "B000R206FK", "B0039ZBM3W", "B0001ZMWYG", "B000AJJNIQ", "B0000CBXZ6", "B0000CBXZ5", "B0007US79Y", "0761504826", "B0039ZBM1O", "B00BHLTIXQ", "B0002NY81C", "B004XWLN20", "B000F4RH8E", "B0002W4SWW", "B0080QOKHU", "B00BGI086Q", "B0002ZMHX6", "B00022FWEU", "1401238246", "B0029WGIDK", "B00HMOW9YM", "B000CSTK42", "B00005JM3A", "B000EYK4H6", "B001OD8E4G", "B000LE178Y", "B0009W5J4Q", "B000GYI336", "B00E5G03I4", "B0016QNSGA", "B00J49R0ZQ", "B0015XWU9A", "B00HUPC5QU", "B0049IHWYG", "B003YJFALS", "B00344EAG4", "B00HMOWA0A", "B003L77FWU", "B003W5C0TY", "B00DYEN6XC", "B0030VANIU", "B001DJLD2G", "B003XL6EI0", "B000CQM4YM", "B000IJ79UW", "B001MVWLYY", "B004EPZ07K", "B004P7CN3G", "B003L77FYS", "B001B23ED6", "B0009KQP96", "B0006GAOP4", "B000EPFCXQ", "B00008ZL4Q", "B000IJ79X4", "B008JFUPFI", "B0053O89KG"], "bought_together": ["B000BT96EG", "B00BBXSPES"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00BBXSPES", "B000BT96EG", "B00BBXSPCK", "B000HWZ4BG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 20935}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 14.57, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00080ZG2O", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510r8P8kLIL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman: Season 1"}

{"description": "If the phrase \"Marcia Marcia Marcia!\" sends you into a giddy childhood reverie, then you'd better run out and getThe Brady Bunch - The Complete Third Season. Not only does this season feature that definitive episode--in which middle sister Jan fights to get out from under the shadow of her older sister Marcia--but several other all-time favorite episodes, including the one in which Peter's voice starts to change, threatening to wreck the potentially blazing career of the Brady Six musical group (presumably launched by producers feeling the heat fromThe Partridge Family). The show had found its tone and its creators crafted 23 perfectly calibrated visions of a domestic fantasyland, decked out in mini-skirts and bell-bottoms (check out Mrs. Brady's recurring paisley pantsuit, made of some fabric offensive to nature). Marcia turns into a diva when cast as Juliet in the school play; Greg loses a bet with Bobby and has to obey the little boy's every whim for a week; Jan has to wear glasses; Cindy yearns for a boyfriend--simple problems cheerfully solved by pithy moral lectures delivered by stern but loving parents.  Despite adolescent hormones, snug pants, and the occasional ungodly short-shorts, sex never rears its complicated head.Though ratings were modest during the series' five-year run, in syndication the show became a phenomenon. As divorce became increasingly common in the 1970s, perhaps this smoothly blended and impossibly functional family had an  irresistible appeal to kids from broken homes.  Though the Brady siblings--played by Barry Williams, Maureen McCormack, Christopher Knight, Eve Plumb, Mike Lookinland, and Susan Olsen--were a charismatic sextet, it's Florence Henderson and especially Robert Reed as Carol and Mike Brady, uber-parents, who giveThe Brady Bunchits familial glow.

{"description": "Movie studios, by and large, avoid controversial subjects like race the way you might avoid a hive of angry bees. So it's remarkable thatCrasheven got made; that it's a rich, intelligent, and moving exploration of the interlocking lives of a dozen Los Angeles residents--black, white, latino, Asian, and Persian--is downright amazing. A politically nervous district attorney (Brendan Fraser) and his high-strung wife (Sandra Bullock, biting into a welcome change of pace fromMiss Congeniality) get car-jacked by an oddly sociological pair of young black men (Larenz Tate and Chris \"Ludacris\" Bridges); a rich black T.V. director (Terrence Howard) and his wife (Thandie Newton) get pulled over by a white racist cop (Matt Dillon) and his reluctant partner (Ryan Phillipe); a detective (Don Cheadle) and his Latina partner and lover (Jennifer Esposito) investigate a white cop who shot a black cop--these are only three of the interlocking stories that reach up and down class lines. Writer/director Paul Haggis (who wrote the screenplay forMillion Dollar Baby) spins every character in unpredictable directions, refusing to let anyone sink into a stereotype. The cast--ranging from the famous names above to lesser-known but just as capable actors like Michael Pena (Buffalo Soldiers) and Loretta Devine (Woman Thou Art Loosed)--meets the strong script head-on, delivering galvanizing performances in short vignettes, brief glimpses that build with gut-wrenching force.

{"description": "More than merely a sports documentary or an inspirational profile of triumph over adversity, \"Murderball\" offers a refreshing and progressive attitude toward disability while telling unforgettable stories about uniquely admirable people. It's ostensibly a film about quadriplegic rugby (or \"Murderball,\" as it was formerly known), in which players with at least \"some\" loss of physical function in all four limbs navigate modified wheelchairs in a hardcore, full-contact sport that takes them all the way to the Paralympic Games in Athens, Greece, in 2004. But as we get to know paralyzed or amputee players on Team USA like Andy Cohn, Scott Hogsett, Bob Lujano and charismatic team spokesman Mark Zupan, we come to understand that quad rugby is a saving grace for these determined competitors, who battle Team Canada coach (and former Team USA superstar) Joe Soares en route to the climactic contest in Athens. Simply put, \"Murderball\" is the best film to date about living with a severe disability, but codirectors Henry Alex Rubin and Dana Adam Shapiro avoid the sappy, inspirational sentiment that hampers nearly all mainstream films involving disability. By the time this blazing 85-minute film reaches its emotional conclusion, the issue of disability is almost irrelevant; these guys are as normal as anyone, and their life stories led to \"Murderball\" becoming the most critically acclaimed documentary of 2005. \"--Jeff Shannon\"", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002KE5VUS", "B000XQ4HR8", "B0007WFYBG", "B001E5FYS8", "B009YQJ2Q4", "B004YEMK7O", "B000BMY2NS", "B00005RIY3", "B00DUX290S", "B006JN8748", "B0007V6IUS", "B000A2XCBC", "B00007ELEK", "B008SGVSMM", "B00GV8B0OA", "B00GMV8DFU", "B00005JNV9", "B004YCKKIM", "B004U7MR1Y", "0786881623", "B0003JAO8Q", "B000CDSS18", "B0012LDNIC", "B002PLMJ74", "B00EPD3CC6", "0767846869", "B00DVLKMWQ", "B0000SXK0Y", "B0013LRKYO", "B001QTVP8A", "159486845X", "0472032364", "B00022FW4U", "0812924126", "B00AEK9BKQ", "B000189DZE", "0767821432", "B0001L3LUE", "B000MZGN40", "B004UXUV98", "B004IOPDJ2", "0803621795", "B008IG09FO", "0679728244", "B0087OULO6", "B002LE8MP8", "B000A3XY5A", "0240812417", "B00A92MGLA", "B0000WN13Q", "0470619007", "1932603336", "B000ELL1RG", "B0038M2AZA", "B00375LBK8", "1401812325", "B00CTBQUIE", "0814785646", "B002TVQ48A", "0807022020", "B0027BOL4G", "B008VR7U8O", "B001BEK8FQ", "B005S9EIGU", "B000FIMG7C", "B00009YXAS", "B001QIP5C8", "0814757286", "B00A4TMLKE", "B00020X94W", "B000GBEWMA", "B00005KHJY", "B0002OXVBO", "B007CEFTSA", "0781783518", "B0000YEEGM", "B00008DDVV", "B007UW9WOQ", "B002E01LOI", "0800177258", "B008JFUTT0", "B00AIBZKFG", "B0087IT8FK", "B004CJQVQC", "B00AEFZ63M", "B000E1NXJ0", "0822351110", "B001EP8EOY"], "bought_together": ["B000XQ4HR8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000GG1F4S", "B000XQ4HR8", "B001E5FYS8"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 89146}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.89, "brand": "THINKFILM LLC", "asin": "B000B5XP24", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61YKSQPQ5PL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Murderball"}

{"description": "Family Bondsis an endearingly raw peek into the lives of the Evangelistas, a large Long Island family who happen to work together as bail bondsmen. The 10 episodes compiled here follow family patriarch Tom Evangelista, his wife Flo, and their children, friends, and co-workers as they track down unsavory characters in New York City while dealing with a host of issues at home, from their youngest son's attempt to master riding a bike to the birth of their first grandchild. And it's the balance between these two worlds, which invariably overlap in intriguing ways (Flo is called in to handle a female fugitive; Tom must deal with his eldest son Sal's desire for a gun when he joins the business) that makesFamily Bondssuch a watchable program--the Evangelistas, for all their rough edges, manage to remain a caring and even sweet family in the face of their unpleasant line of work. Their commitment to one another offers a refreshing alternative to the more cartoonish approach to bail bondsmen offered by the seriesDog the Bounty Hunter. The DVD includes commentary by director Steve Cantor, producer Matthew Galkin, and editor Pax Wasserman, as well as a \"sit down\" with the Evangelistas at a family barbecue.--Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0017PFN0O", "B004MCGNT4", "B003JLL2WM", "B006ND9ZUO", "B001PTA34I", "B002FL5J12", "B005TZFYQQ", "B000L212EK", "B000OIOPPY", "B000NO241G", "B003X2P944", "B002G952GU", "B000S0GYN4", "B000LPR6EM"], "bought_together": ["B0017PFN0O", "B000L212EK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004MCGNT4", "B005TZFYQQ", "B006ND9ZUO", "B003X2P944"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 194568}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 7.98, "brand": "HBO HOME VIDEO", "asin": "B000BBOUA4", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51R832YFAZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Family Bonds - The Complete First Season"}

{"description": "The first half ofBattlestar Galactica's second season left no doubts about the continuing excellence of the best science fiction TV series of 2005. Beginning with the Colonial Fleet separated, Col. Tigh (Michael Hogan) botching his temporary command, and Capt. Adama (Edward James Olmos) near death after a Cylon assassination attempt, series producer/developer Ronald D. Moore and his gifted writing staff packed more into these 10 episodes than most series manage in a full season. Maintaining its reputation as an adult drama, the series is compellingly anchored by the gravitas of Olmos and Mary McDonnell, whose role as Fleet President Laura Roslin grows more complex as she reveals her diagnosis of breast cancer and defies Adama, playing the \"religious card\" with her conviction that prophetic visions will lead the embattled fleet toward its legendary home planet Earth. As Adama's son Apollo (Jamie Bamber) wrestles with his role in Roslin's mutinous agenda, paranoia runs high as Cylon copies (or \"avatars\") of Boomer (Grace Park) complicate matters aboard Galactica and on Kobol, where a lost Raptor crew struggles to survive and Dr. Baltar (James Callis) endures the increasingly haunting and manipulative intrusions into his tormented psyche by Number Six (Tricia Helfer), the seductive Cylon who holds the secret to the Cylon master plan to destroy humankind.Further action takes place on Cylon-occupied Caprica, where Starbuck (Katee Sackhoff) and Helo (Tamoh Penikett) discover a group of human resistance fighters who survived the Cylons' nuclear attack in season 1. As all of these plot threads are expertly interwoven, the high-stakes conflict ofBG 2.0culminates in a suspenseful mid-season cliffhanger. Through all of this,Battlestar Galacticamaintains consistently high standards of intelligent drama and well-justified, story-based use of spectacular special effects, while developing rich relationships across a broad spectrum of interesting supporting characters. The series' large and likable cast is well-used throughout (even smaller roles are given adequate dimension), and Moore's \"podcast\" commentaries provide a smart, thorough analysis of the show's writing process and conceptual evolution. Yes, it's undeniably true that this half-season DVD set is a blatantly commercial ploy to lure more and more viewers into the ongoing season (which resumed in January 2006), but you can hardly blame Universal for capitalizing on a high-quality series. With solid ratings, good scripts, and a devoted cast and crew,Battlestar Galacticashowed every indication of thriving toward a third season and beyond.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001HUWQEA", "B00129W6LE", "B000AJJNFE", "B002HRF68A", "B000V5IP6K", "B002ZCY872", "B00A3717C0", "B00466H3A4", "B00064AFBE", "B001RTCP1U", "B002JE43O4", "B000W4KT9G", "B003RR991Y", "B00GX7D5G0", "B002HRF7AW", "B003H9LIYS", "B00A3718IS", "B0000AFX64", "B00C7MW5SE", "B00344EAFK", "B001B7CNZ6", "B000QDLSR0", "B000UZ4C4A", "B000F8O2OM", "B000F8O2OW", "B00IWTVDUW", "B000F8O2P6", "1417078723", "B005PPMHWE", "B0024FAD9C", "B00005JNOG", "B00242KD1S", "B0032JTUX4", "B002BAW6GS", "B002N5N5MK", "B000BW7QWW", "B00BD6K54G", "B0007TKH66", "B003H9LIRK", "B0017MO10U", "B002BAW6GI", "B000A9QKRI", "B000FCUYKO", "6303961614", "B004EXWGHY", "B00F6WXPSQ", "B003L77GWE", "B000F8O2Q0", "B0009Q0F5U", "B003L77GUG", "B004HYW84G", "B000LC4ZI0", "B000B8IA2G", "B007USE5CE", "B0002PYS7Y", "B002BWP2IK", "B001RHGRTS", "B0000AQS0F", "B002BAW6FE", "B000F8O2PG", "B00243FQFA", "B000HEZEY6", "B000FIMG68", "B00E3QJ7JC", "B000F8O2PQ", "B000B837XI", "B005PPMHO2", "B00GTZWZH6", "B000RBA6CO", "B0009JE6G6", "B0048FUUAI", "B0028ERCMU", "B0081QF6Q8", "B003BNO9GO", "B000GLKNRI", "B004X60QWO", "B00062IDCO", "B0030VANJO", "B002BAW6FY", "B007XF0XVQ", "B00F3L8P26", "B000FP2OPY", "B001D2WUGG", "B00402FGE4", "B0057FGD3Q", "B0000CABIJ", "B003BV8I7C", "B002VA59ZS", "B000SO7PBU", "B00E8OMZGG", "B002VA5A02", "B00188XHFI", "B001DMVZOE", "B008R52LA2", "B002PXJRR2", "B004X60QE2", "B004TJ1H3C", "B000CEXFYW", "B0002WZTCA"], "bought_together": ["B001HUWQEA", "B00129W6LE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0036EH3UC", "B000AJJNFE", "B00129W6LE", "B00A3717C0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 29107}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 14.69, "brand": "Universal Studios", "asin": "B000BNI90Y", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51IfCLLm3jL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Battlestar Galactica - Season 2.0 (Episodes 1-10)"}
{"description": "Blockbuster action director Michael Bay delivers a striking look at a strange world of the future in this sci-fi action drama. Midway through the 21st century, Lincoln Six Echo (Ewan McGregor) lives in a confined indoor community after ongoing abuse of the Earth has rendered most of the planet uninhabitable. One of the only places in the outside world still capable of sustaining life is an idyllic island where citizens are chosen to live through a lottery. Or at least that's what Lincoln and his fellow citizens are taught to believe; the truth is that Lincoln, like everyone he knows, is actually a clone who is kept under wraps to provide needed organs when the person who supplied his or her DNA falls ill.

After being physically assaulted by a coworker, Josey tries to fight against the harassment, but none of the other women will join her case for fear that things will only get worse.North Country, directed by Niki Caro (Whale Rider), makes the women's experience palpable for the audience without overdoing it. But the lawsuit is only part of the movie; the gut impact ofNorth Countrycomes from the devastating effect the lawsuit has on Josey's family, friends, and coworkers--thanks to an incredible ensemble cast that includes Sissy Spacek (In the Bedroom), Sean Bean (Lord of the Rings), Richard Jenkins (Six Feet Under), Woody Harrelson (The People vs. Larry Flynt), and the always powerful Frances McDormand (Fargo,Mississippi Burning). The courtroom histrionics don't always ring true, but the family conflict is riveting and deeply moving.

{"description": "The latest entry in theHarry Pottersaga could be retitledFast Times at Hogwarts, where finding a date to the winter ball is nearly as terrifying as worrying about Lord Voldemort's return. Thus, the young wizards' entry into puberty (and discovery of the opposite sex) opens up a rich mining field to balance out the dark content in the fourth movie (and the stories are only going to get darker). Mike Newell (Four Weddings and a Funeral) handily takes the directing reins and eases his young cast through awkward growth spurts into true young actors. Harry (Daniel Radcliffe, more sure of himself) has his first girl crush on fellow student Cho Chang (Katie Leung), and has his first big fight with best bud Ron (Rupert Grint). Meanwhile, Ron's underlying romantic tension with Hermione (Emma Watson) comes to a head over the winter ball, and when she makes one of those girl-into-woman Cinderella entrances, the boys' reactions indicate they've all crossed a threshold.But don't worry, there's plenty of wizardry and action inGoblet of Fire. When the deadly Triwizard Tournament is hosted by Hogwarts, Harry finds his name mysteriously submitted (and chosen) to compete against wizards from two neighboring academies, as well as another Hogwarts student. The competition scenes are magnificently shot, with much-improved CGI effects (particularly the underwater challenge). And the climactic confrontation with Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes, in a brilliant bit of casting) is the most thrilling yet.Goblet, the first installment to get a PG-13 rating, contains some violence as well as disturbing images for kids and some barely shrouded references at sexual awakening (Harry's bath scene in particular). The 2 1/2-hour film, lean considering it came from a 734-page book, trims out subplots about house-elves (they're not missed) and gives little screen time to the standard crew of the otherPotterfilms, but adds in more of Britain's finest actors to the cast, such as Brendan Gleeson as Mad-Eye Moody and Miranda Richardson as Rita Skeeter. Michael Gambon, in his second round as Professor Dumbledore, still hasn't brought audiences around to his interpretation of the role he took over after Richard Harris died, but it's a small smudge in an otherwise spotless adaptation.--Ellen A.

{"description": "Gidgetlaunched the career of the ever-perky Sally Field (who decades later still looks like the sweetie-pie beach bunny she played in the mid-'60s series). The show is a valentine to Southern California, surfing, and plucky girl power--in fact, Gidget's self-aware musings and intrepid ways of getting out of trouble lay the groundwork for later TV heroines like Buffy and Veronica Mars. The show's aged surprisingly well, mostly because of the undeniable charms of Field, who seems to take her teenage \"horror stories\"--as when squeeze Jeff (a.k.a. Moon Doggie) is poised to return to Princeton and suggests they date other people--with a knowing grain of salt. The teen drama is all a bit tongue in cheek, since it's clear nothing will get our Gidget down for long. The dialogue is a real treat, a crazy mix of late film noir (\"How old's the underripe tomato?\") and pre-Summer of Love hipster California-speak (\"Well, look at all the wiggy birds around here!\"). The set includes all 32 episodes, with a short interview with Field, who has a lot of affection for her young persona--as do we all, Daddy-o.--A.T.

{"description": "Gay has rarely been so glamorous as in the American version ofQueer as Folk. But the show's success rests on more than hard bodies and glossy, picture-perfect sex (though there's an abundance of that); this series gave its characters a multidimensional richness that rivals more high-profile programs likeSix Feet UnderorThe Sopranos, while tackling an impressive breadth of social and political issues without ever (well, almost never) feeling preachy. The fifth and final season lays out its themes with authority: Alpha-gay Brian (Gale Howard) buys and revamps the sex club Babylon, declaring promiscuity and independence as a gay birthright, while Brian's oldest friend Michael (Hal Sparks,Talk Soup) embraces domesticity with his partner Ben (Robert Gant); the flamboyant Emmett (Peter Paige) finds success as a tv personality, only to find his persona may trap him in a stereotype; and Ted (Scott Lowell) grapples with body prejudices within the gay community.  Meanwhile, the crumbling relationship of Mel (Michelle Clunie) and Lindsay (Thea Gill) takes a more troubling turn when Michael demands more rights as the father of their daughter.Most tv series would take a topic like this last legal wrangle and stretch it over an entire season, butQueer as Folkis more ambitious; the writers recognize that the resolution of one problem is rarely the end of the story, that muddy consequences can be as dramatically compelling as head-to-head conflict. This aggressive and effective plotting, combined with the show's willingness to explore the complexities of every issue--be it assimilation or the coming out of a celebrity--results in an increasing emotional power as the series steamrolls towards its final episode. Some subplots can be silly (Brian has a ridiculous stud-off with a new hot guy in town), the dialogue can sometimes veer from wit to camp cliches, and the omnipresence of sculpted, muscular physiques is absurd and even a little alienating for some viewers, butQueer as Folk's strengths--the compassion and intelligence of the writers, the commitment and nuance of the acting--make this show a true television landmark and a pleasure to watch. And then, of course, there's all that graphic and lovingly photographed sex. Rosie O'Donnell and Cyndi Lauper make guest appearances, and Sharon Gless (Cagney & Lacey) continues her much-loved performance as Michael's mother, Debbie.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0007DBJG4", "B0000798EY", "B00005RIY5", "B0056G1APC", "B0009PVZO6", "B0007NFMCQ", "B002ZDOY8O", "B00GWWV1XU", "B00GHP8SH4", "B004L03B3S", "B00HHYF5EI", "B0009UVBGI", "B001NJY4X6", "B00005B1GU", "B0000560PU", "B00FGG60XY", "B00GSA3K6C", "B00FPVGWY2", "B00F98FOPE", "B002L1YGRY", "B0002I84JO", "B0013D8LCW", "B002SSNFUO", "B0080JX4Y2", "B000BZISX0", "B0042KZJFA", "B000NVT0UM", "B00IA7MFEO", "B0001HAGRE", "0743476360", "B00EU8RB14", "B001BN4WMC", "B00008XS4N", "B001G0MFOM", "B00E849QSG", "B0083V2VYG", "B002PCVLWW", "B00023B14O", "B00DUJH94S", "B004QLX0PQ", "B007L6JQ3S", "B00KMULA9I", "B000R7G9JW", "B001VPJYZU", "B0000A2ZNK", "B000WDVNMO", "B0011U52EM", "B00IPL2BK8", "B0018CWEVW", "B0009W5JSW", "B00996RSYM", "B001CT05N0", "B00E44FEAE", "B0000640N0", "B000TGJ8D0", "B003517UWC", "B0000639HT", "B0002MPQRS", "B0012FA8CC", "B00EJGMF22", "B00HUQCA28", "B00I6JODGO", "B000980GWU", "B00006FDBN", "B00IZ7ZC3A", "B00005UQ7X", "B0084BM7NK", "B00008UALE", "B00IKM5MIA", "B00JF5G8WU", "B004XKUFY4", "B005OTQIK8", "B000063K0V", "B0007ZEOPK", "0780629167", "B00E99FYOK", "B0000DD75N", "B00099415C", "B001CQONPE", "B004PQBYVE", "B000UX6TK2", "B000FZEU1A", "B00F878KAC", "B0009QTRVI", "B00HQKREFG", "B008JFX04G", "B000UNYJOK", "B002N57KGM", "B0042L0OFE", "1884190618", "B001Y7CVXC", "B00014NE62", "B000LAZDQA", "B008N25X7M", "B00D1BODEY", "B003F3NE7K"], "bought_together": ["B0007DBJG4", "B0000798EY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000UX6TK2", "B00005RIY5", "B0000798EY", "B0007DBJG4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 56643}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 29.85, "brand": "Paramount", "asin": "B000EHSV5K", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510SB2P79ZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Queer as Folk - The Final Season (Collector's Edition)"}
{"description": "CBS had an instant hit on their hands whenThe Wild Wild Westmade its network debut on September 17, 1965. While many of the popularTV Westernswere running out of steam, series creator Michael Garrison ripped a page from the Ian Fleming/Sean Connery playbook and conceivedThe Wild Wild Westas a \"James Bond Western,\" energizing the genre by combining a traditional Western setting (primarily the San Francisco region in the 1870s) with the accoutrements of the spy genre. It was a foolproof formula, further refined by producer Fred Frieberger (who later produced the third and final season ofStar Trek), andTWWWheld its popular time-slot (7:30-8:30 on Friday nights) for its entire four-season run. Smart casting proved to be another source of audience appeal: While Robert Conrad fit nicely into his role (and tight-fitting costume) as macho Secret Service agent James West, doing his own challenging stunts and charming each episode's obligatory beautiful female guest star, Ross Martin proved an equally excellent choice to play West's skillful sidekick Artemus Gordon, a debonair dandy whose mastery of disguises and dialects would prove essential as they tackled dangerous crime-fighting assignments from President Ulysses S. Grant.The series' unique appeal arose from its clever and frequently bizarre plots. Every episode title began with a variation of \"The Night of...\" (including the pilot, \"The Night of the Inferno,\" with more unusual titles thereafter), and as Jim and Arte plotted strategies from the comfort of their tricked-out custom railroad car, their exploits frequently led them into realms of the occult, mad science, bizarre inventions, and villains so eccentrically twisted that they became instant favorites among the show's growing legion of fans. Best of them all was the nefarious Miguelito Loveless, first appearing in \"The Night the Wizard Shook the Earth\" (original airdate 10/01/65) and played to perfection by dwarf actor Michael Dunn, a '60s TV regular familiar toStar Trekfans from his memorable role in the original series episode \"Plato's Stepchildren.\" A gifted, intellectual renaissance man (like Ross Martin) with an angelic singing voice, Dunn was an overnight sensation, guest-starring in four of the first season's 28 episodes, with six more appearances in subsequent seasons. Dunn's gleeful malevolence (accompanied by his mute henchman Voltaire, played by giant actor Richard Kiel) was an essential addition to the series' sideshow esthetic; weirdness, humor, gorgeous women, and devious ingenuity (in plotting, action and gadgetry), became the trademarks that setTWWWapart from its more conventional TV Western competition.--Jeff ShannonOn the DVDFor this much-anticipated DVD release, Paramount has made above-average efforts to satisfy fans. Virtually every episode looks and sounds practically brand-new, and withTWWWexpert Sue Kesler serving as DVD co-producer, this seven-disc set features a wealth of archival extras, many culled from Kesler's own research as author of the out-of-print guidebookThe Wild Wild West: The Series. In addition to excerpts from audio-taped interviews with Frieberger, writer (and \"Dr. Loveless\" creator) John Kneubuhl (who tells a fascinating story of how Liberace almost guest-starred on the show), music composer Richard Markowitz, and special-effects technician Tim Smyth, each episode includes brief but informative audio introductions by Robert Conrad, who also appears (with Martin) discussing the show (and their subsequent TV-movie revival ofTWWW) in a 1978 talk-show appearance. Excerpts from the original music-theme scoring sessions were found in UCLA's Film and Television archive, and other extras include a network series promo clip (from a later season, afterTWWWswitched to color), a sketch by Ross Martin, a photo gallery, and even one of Conrad's notorious Eveready Battery commercials from the late '70s. All in all, this 40th Anniversary package should giveTWWWfans ample reason to celebrate, boding well for the other season-sets to follow.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000LE16Y4", "B000UX6TKC", "B00105307O", "B000HWZ4HU", "B0012EBV88", "B000BOH8Z0", "B000NOIX66", "B000BZISS0", "B0007KIFK0", "B00E5G03I4", "B0012EBV8I", "B000UX6TJI", "B007AAF3FK", "B000BGR1B4", "B000LE16VC", "B00HQLZCIQ", "B000CCBCK8", "B00J9BZ4KC", "B0000DC3VM", "B00KTZALDC", "B000EQ46HI", "B000EQ46H8", "B000FFJ87Q", "B000EHSVB4", "B000EXDS2A", "B00IXPWGIS", "B0012Z36FI", "B000A6T1J0", "B000K7VHYG", "B00B00HUC0", "B001BN4WI6", "B00005JNS8", "B000GUJZ0U", "B0002COTDA", "B008I34Y3K", "B000FSME1K", "B000PHX5KU", "B0007YMWGY", "B000IHYXIK", "B000M8N412", "B002DPH91I", "B000NOIX7K", "B00E96AY20", "B00FNRA0KA", "B00JEZWRE4", "B0002CX1M0", "B000XJD3K2", "B00005JNHU", "B000PGTPC8", "B000E33VZ4", "B000W8OM68", "B00JDCP0QA", "B0044XV7AQ", "B00K6J7FGC", "B000N6UF10", "B001E6JC30", "B0014FAIVG", "B00BXTDVEO", "B00013F38K", "B009V2KO9K", "B000N2HD6O", "B001S86IZE", "B005TZFYWA", "B000LV6W00", "B002L9N4E2", "B0046S8MRU", "B002GOAH1A", "B0002W4TVM", "B000LPS2VS", "B00BUDDMGU", "B00A2L1CKO", "B001FT4PEW", "B0014BQR3I", "B000LXGXY8", "B0006UEVTA", "B000BF0C8E", "B00132D7VI", "B001E6JC1W", "B001CQONOA", "B0009B16TO", "B00005JLEY", "B000ASDFIG", "B000FOQ03C", "B001TWT0CW", "B000F9T70K", "B000ARLYDK", "B0013PVGGI", "B0001JXQ2Y", "B00GWJIDB6", "B0000V4906", "B000TQZBNQ", "B000FSMEB0", "B004X1M3IO", "B007V4ETS2", "B00CMQIDVI", "B000RZIGTA", "B00BUWD7NE", "B001J0FVYK", "B00IS6WQ2S", "B00CCYNYBO"], "bought_together": ["B000LE16Y4", "B000UX6TKC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001CQONOA", "B000LE16Y4", "B000UX6TKC", "B00105307O"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 46749}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 29.08, "brand": "Wild West", "asin": "B000ERVJKO", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51AS4MSEK2L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Wild Wild West - The Complete First Season"}
{"description": "Deadwood: The Complete Second Seasoncontinues the Shakespearean brilliance of the landmarkfirst season, created byNYPD Bluehead writer David Milch. Milch either wrote or supervised the writing of each of the 12 episodes in this stunning follow-up, which contains more than a few surprises for anyone who thought they knew the myriad characters in the late 19th century town of Deadwood--a mucky, ungoverned, exceptionally violent development in South Dakota. As with the first season,Deadwoodcontinues to be about many things--survival, loyalty, alliances, duty--but all of them are happening against a titanic battle between several parties to consolidate power and real wealth in the territory. Despite his cutthroat ethics, astonishing profanity, and bursts of cruelty, it's hard not to side in this bid for a piece of America's future with saloon owner Al Swearengen (a magnificent performance by Ian McShane), a visionary monster who is nevertheless more recognizably human than his rivals.Entering an uneasy partnership with Al is Seth Bullock (Timothy Olyphant). Seth begins the second season by teaching Al a few lessons in chivalry, and their brief but bloody feud commences physical ailments for Al that become increasingly shocking to behold. Yet Al's difficulties have the practical effect of sidelining him for a couple of episodes while the story sets up more complex power struggles. Al takes on Deadwood's other saloon-brothel owner, the unstable Cy Tolliver (Powers Boothe), as well as an off-screen millionaire who is intent on owning all the gold-mining interests by buying out weary prospectors' claims. Meanwhile, Seth's wife and son (actually, his late brother's widow and child) arrive, an unsettling development for Seth's lover, the widow Alma Garret (Molly Parker), who soon reveals herself to be a more complicated person than in the first season. The prostitute Trixie (Paula Malcomson) begins thinking about her future and asserts independence from Al by having sex with Seth's friend, Sol Star (John Hawkes). Best of all, Calamity Jane (Robin Weigert) is back and more endearingly uncivilized than ever. Special features include actor commentaries on select episodes, the best of which finds Olyphant and McShane cracking each other up while watching the season premiere.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000NVI2GU", "B0006FO5LO", "B00B5J6A7W", "B007A2Z3Y4", "B0038M2APA", "B0075FF5QM", "B00A2JOQMW", "B004HW7JNS", "B00CG4XKNM", "B00EAPC860", "B00076YPUI", "B00HT850YW", "B00G4RCCUE", "B004BZ5AHI", "B000067S1G", "B008PJZDXW", "B00005NOHO", "B0028RXXE8", "B0090XO59U", "B0007YMVWO", "B00HUCF420", "B005LAJ1H2", "B00J5LXT44", "B009LDD54K", "B00316DDUO", "B0010XB1WM", "B00C8CQRQ4", "B00BC5I6Q2", "B00CDTSFF8", "B00EIXWW2O", "B002UJIY7A", "B0012RLX88", "B003Y5HWJU", "B000E3L7F0", "B0060MYKYY", "B00FEP9MYG", "B00EEDNR9A", "B000K2V7E6", "B00008PW1F", "B00BFAIH68", "B000BO7DWI", "B0058YPG1G", "B00IXWIFR2", "1596912391", "B000PGTPH8", "B00EUI4XHE", "B002N5N5QQ", "B0051GOB2G", "B003FSTN7U", "B00HW3EXCE", "B0032UYFA6", "B0007R4SWM", "B004QRUN96", "B00BQ42Q38", "B0032JTV6A", "B00GWJIDFW", "B001RTSPVY", "B001GCUER0", "B001TH8ZH8", "B00G0B7PTW", "B0006UEVUE", "6304711905", "B000NA1VI2", "B004CQZFH6", "B00280LZAE", "B000OIOOVE", "B00FRQ0HOQ", "B0015A5JVY", "B003PIUBZS", "B000FL7CB4", "B00BGI076M", "B009ERK2UI", "B001DJLCRC", "B00DJYJRHG", "B000YABIQ6", "B000EMGF3U", "B002ZCY8CC", "B002LITH76", "B001OQCVFG", "B001IBIHQ4", "B00KHA9BQ2", "B0009NZ2W4", "B00AATGDUC", "B0024FAR5M", "B003L77GS8", "B00CBJ53HS", "B00C7AO2J6", "B0038M2AOG", "B006CR2OOA", "B0012CJQYQ", "B008JFUS5A", "B00E1LSJIO", "B005FISBTO", "B000ENUYGI", "B000E6EK42", "B009LDD1H6", "B00HOGBXS6", "B00ECGHM5O", "B001EO748M", "B004WXBMT4"], "bought_together": ["B000NVI2GU", "B0006FO5LO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0006FO5LO", "B001FA1OTU", "B000NVI2GU", "B00B5J6A7W"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 5202}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 35.0, "brand": "Warner Brothers", "asin": "B000EULSR0", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51TO7W-wZzL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Deadwood: Season 2"}

{"description": "Say \"Warner Bros. in the '30s\" and you're talking, first and foremost, about the tough, gritty, urban, street-smart movies that help define that American decade for us.  Which means you're talking about James Cagney, Edward G. Robinson, and Humphrey Bogart: unpretty but charismatic guys with lived-in faces, and bodies that always seemed cocked, ready to spring.  When one of them entered a room, he owned it, no matter how many people were there already.  Their most celebrated habitat was the gangster picture.  The genre didn't originate with them, but they, more than anybody else, defined it, gave it a face and a silhouette and a heartbeat.The films in this set were produced half a decade and more afterLittle CaesarandThe Public Enemymade stars of Robinson and Cagney, respectively, and after repeal had begun to lend Prohibition the patina of nostalgia.  The studio's gangster franchise was evolving, and so were the careers of its top stars.  When it came to toughness, the boys could still dish it out, and take it, too.  But increasingly they were doing it on the other side of the law-and-order divide.Cagney was first to reform.  In 1935's\"G\" Menhe plays a lawyer put through college by the avuncular neighborhood crimelord.  After a law-school pal turned F.B.I. agent is murdered, Cagney abandons his (resolutely legit) one-man practice and joins the Bureau.  The film memorializes several big moments in F.B.I. legend, but what's grabbiest is the personal drama growing out of Cagney's lingering underworld friendships.  William Keighley directs the murders and shootouts with jolting ferocity, Barton MacLane and Edward Pawley supply flavorful villainy, and there are times when Sol Polito's cinematography literally glows (all these films have been restored, but\"G\" Menlooks especially terrific).  One gripe: The movie should have been presented without the F.B.I.-classroom intro tacked on for 1949 reissue (which belongs under \"Special Features\").InEach Dawn I Die(also Keighley, 1939), Cagney teams with George Raft making his Warners debut.  It's mostly a prison picture, with muckraking reporter Cagney behind bars after being framed by crooked politicos.  Career felon Raft has little sympathy for him till Cagney proves to be a stand-up guy, whereupon the two bond in mutual loathing of sadistic guards, rat-fink convicts, and the endlessly malleable system. The movie boasts one indelible scene (involving a movie screening for the cons), some evocative prison workhouse detailing, and a fine Cagney performance as always.  But it's undone by a script cluttered with melodrama and contrivance.Bullets or Ballots(Keighley yet again, 1936) is much more satisfying.  Again we get two icons for the price of one, with Robinson as a tough but square-shooting police detective and Bogart as the ambitious number-two man to a big-time racketeer.  Bogart's effectively the co-star, albeit fourth-billed behind Robinson, Joan Blondell, and Barton MacLane. But it's Eddie G.'s movie, and he walks the line beautifully as an honest cop who, unjustly jettisoned from the force, signs on with the mobster he's long pursued.  Despite a rhetorical reference to \"ballots\" as the public's means of combatting crime, it's bullets that get the job done. Bullets and fists: the movie makes clear that Robinson has beaten confessions out of people plenty of times, just as it has no illusions about the empty symbolism of crime commissions and grand juries.The only other Bogart vehicle in the set isSan Quentin(Lloyd Bacon, 1937), a scrap-work effort below the standards of everybody involved.  Bogart's a small-time crook whose arrest at a nightclub occasions a meet-cute for his big sister Ann Sheridan and Army training officer Pat O'Brien--who's on his way to become yard captain at the penitentiary where Bogart will be interred!  O'Brien tries to reform the lad, but with corrupt/sadistic guard Barton MacLane on one side and sociopathic con Joe Sawyer on the other, Bogart never has a chance. Neither does the viewer.Lloyd Bacon, normally one of Warners' zippiest directors, is back on his game withA Slight Case of Murder(1938), a delicious gangstercomedy.  Robinson plays beer baron Remy Marco, who craves respectability as a legitimate businessman once beer is legal again. Problem is, nobody has ever had the heart to tell him his product tastes like varnish, and soon the bank is out to foreclose on his brewery.  At which point Remy learns that his summer home upstate is full of fresh gangland corpses....  Based on a play by Damon Runyon and Howard Lindsay, the picture gives a trio of glorious goons--Allen Jenkins, Edward Brophy, and Harold Huber--a rare chance to shine as Marco's house staff.City for Conquest(1940) ought to be the showpiece here.  It's the longest and most ambitious entry, with prestige-picture scale and production values (including Polito and James Wong Howe as cameramen) and a cast including Cagney, Ann Sheridan, Arthur Kennedy, Frank McHugh, Donald Crisp, Anthony Quinn, Jerome Cowan, and--in his first of only two film performances--future directorial giant Elia Kazan.  Working-stiff Cagney loves his gifted musician brother (Kennedy) and childhood sweetheart (Sheridan), a dancer with her own aspirations for the limelight; he becomes a boxer in order to pay for the brother's musical education.  Triumph and tragedy ensue.  The film's avowed aim, and Kennedy's, is to create an urban symphony of New York and the many little people striving against all odds to rise; there's even a one-man Greek chorus--Frank Craven, the Stage Manager of the recentOur Town--to hammer the theme periodically.  But over the previous decade Warners' honest, hard-charging, small-scale movies had collectively achieved that \"symphony,\" without the pompous flourishes Anatole Litvak's direction brings to the project.  Here's hoping DVD showcases more of them.--Richard T.

{"description": "Faith can move mountains--and change men's lives. The inspirational tale inThe Second Chanceweaves the foundation of faith subtly but deeply through the lives of its characters, the Rev. Ethan Jenkins and the Rev. Jake Sanders. Though the two have known each other since they were kids, but their worlds are, well, worlds apart. Ethan (gospel-singing phenom Michael W. Smith) is on staff at the Rock, a wealthy suburban mega-church, and sees a bright future for himself as the head pastor there someday. But his real journey of faith begins when he starts working alongside Jake (an incredibly charismatic Jeff Obafemi Carr) at the Rock's sister church in the poor part of town. The stellar, grounded performances of both Smith and Carr, as well as the brisk direction and soul-stirring music, keepThe Second Chancefrom being too predictable--even though when Ethan first appears in the 'hood, he makes a few rich-guy gaffes, like accidentally ordering a barbecue platter (at the God Almighty chicken restaurant!) that'swaytoo spicy for his white-bread palate. But the film's full-on embrace of faith as a normal part of life makes it bracingly refreshing, and if you can see the characters' redemption coming, it doesn't make it any less uplifting. The DVD is absolutely packed with extras, including interviews with director Steve Taylor as well as stars Smith and Carr; a music video,All in the Serve, by Smith; director's commentary; deleted scenes; and more.--A.T.

{"description": "More guest stars move through the revolving door of Sacred Heart Hospital inScrubs'fourth season, with results as uneven as the show itself. With last season's  climactic end to J.D. (Zach Braff) and Elliot (Sarah Chalke)'s relationship resolved within two episodes, Heather Graham (Boogie Nights) comes on board as a cheerful psychiatrist/love interest, and Julianna Margulies (ER) as a cutthroat malpractice attorney/love interest. But the real love story ofScrubshas always been between J.D. and Turk (Donald Faison), a point that is poked fun at in the season opener, as the two joyously reunite after Turk's honeymoon with nurse Carla (Judy Reyes). Turk and Carla struggle to navigate newlywed life, made all the more complicated by J.D.'s drunken kiss with Carla. Meanwhile, at the hospital, it's Elliot who proves the more proficient doctor when she shares co-chief resident with J.D., and a few (though not enough) patient stories, includingSaturday Night Livealum Molly Shannon as a chatterbox ambulance driver with a secret, Matthew Perry (Friends) as an air traffic controller estranged from his dad (played by John Perry, his real father), and in the most bizarre bit of stunt casting, Colin Farrell (Miami Vice) as an unintelligible Irishman (so, basically himself) andAmerican Idolrunner-up Clay Aiken as a singing cafeteria worker(!).Some ofScrubs'special features this time around are ho-hum, including short vignettes on \"The Mysterious Janitor\" and more on J.D. and Dr. Cox. The only pleasant surprise is an audio commentary from Braff (who was absent from season three's commentaries and was ribbed in season two's disc for being too important shooting films to contribute), speaking on \"My Last Chance,\" which he directed. Season Four is a letdown compared to the previous seasons' smooth navigation between belly laughs and heartache; here's hopingScrubs'trademark hysterics get resuscitated for season five.--Ellen A.

{"description": "Like previous installments, theLooney Tunes Golden Collection, Volume 4mixes favorites from the Warner Bros. archives with relatively obscure older works. Chuck Jones' \"Mississippi Hare\" and Friz Freleng's \"Sahara Hare\" and \"Knighty-Knight Bugs\" (which won an Oscar) offer hilarious performances by Bugs. Two of Jones' earliest films, \"The Night Watchman\" and \"Conrad the Sailor\" prefigure his use of subtle expressions in his later cartoons. The disc of shorts by Frank Tashlin includes \"Plane Daffy\": pigeon see-duck-tress Hatta Mari anticipates Jayne Mansfield in such later Tashlin live-action comedies asWill Success Spoil Rock Hunter?Not all of these films have aged as gracefully. Younger viewers will probably not catch the references to Charlie McCarthy, Bill Robinson, and other old film and radio stars. The Speedy Gonzalez cartoons feature ethnic humor that seems embarrassing today; it's also crashingly unfunny. Each disc offers a disclaimer about stereotypes, noting, \"they were wrong then and are wrong today.\"The discs are loaded with extras that range from a partial set of storyboards for \"Sahara Hare\" to three of the \"Private Snafu\" shorts, which were made for the \"Army-Navy Screen Magazine\" during WW II. The oddest extra is the documentaryBugs Bunny Superstar, which infuriated many of the Warner Bros. artists when it was released in 1977. Much of its information should be taken with a grain of salt. (Unrated, suitable for ages 6 and older: cartoon violence, some ethnic stereotypes, mild risqu&#xE9; humor, alcohol & tobacco use)--Charles Solomon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000TSTEM8", "B000ADS62G", "B001CO42CA", "B00020SK1Y", "B0000AYJXS", "B004176JHQ", "B005LOBWA2", "B0033XKV96", "B00B1LKXZY", "B000MTPA5Y", "B001CO42CK", "B0093I9114", "B003U0AHGE", "B007KW5MJU", "B002JOUNHK", "B000TSTEMI", "B008W8TM10", "B0058O1FIY", "B004L9GM5S", "B000PC1PAW", "B005COLEW2", "B000ADS62Q", "B0007939QG", "B0001CNQUS", "B000HC2LGW", "B001RPZE4E", "B0033XKVEG", "B000R7GKPK", "B000ZOXDK0", "B0000AYJXV", "B000ADS61M", "B000GG4XWE", "B00267N3F4", "B000AOEMU0", "B0081LTIJE", "B0062KMDWU", "B0000AYJXW", "B004ITYDT8", "B002H047OG", "B0002ZMHVI", "B00B1Z6MB4", "B0075SCIFU", "B00HMOWA32", "B00I40QJIA", "B000CEXFZQ", "B001U3N3QY", "B000002LJE", "B0002VNYI2", "B000AOEMTG", "B007NPME5Y", "B001D7T6AO", "B0007XFZMS", "B000P296AS", "B00EQ30Q8S", "B00DT55OSG", "B0002MFGCI", "B005DMHHHY", "B00CM0C2M0", "B004176JIA", "B0011XFOIS", "B000ZBEOHO", "B001B23ED6", "B0000AYJXY", "B000FI9OEU", "B0006J2896", "B000FI9OEK", "B000AOEMUA", "B00ISAQOPE", "B000R7GKPU", "B00COSX8DM", "B000SSQ7JW", "B005BUA1CQ", "B000M2E340", "B0014VPFHW", "B009P3J630", "B000HWZ4DO", "B005T7BWEC", "B005T7BWQK", "B00553KAK2", "B003NLE5HC", "B006VUYIY2", "B00I2YXN5A", "B001ED3JEQ", "B0013527I4", "B00EF4U78M", "B00023E88U", "B00E44EZHC", "B006WQUJ16", "B0007939Q6", "B002WCLG2K", "B00BTJTYB2", "B00CYI4L8S", "B000FA57HG", "B001OXLGKA", "B000QUEQ6I", "B000HWZ4DY", "B009P3J61C", "B000K2UH0G", "B003G9IT32"], "bought_together": ["B000ADS62G", "B000TSTEM8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000ADS62G", "B00020SK1Y", "B0000AYJXS", "B005NFJAQC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 23349}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 29.57, "brand": "Looney Tunes", "asin": "B000HC2LGM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61fFkR6H3jL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Looney Tunes: Golden Collection, Vol. 4"}

{"description": "The canine star ofAir Budand its host of sequels is on the screen again, but this time Buddy, his girlfriend Molly, and their human owners Noah and Henry have their hands and paws full with a litter of five mischievous puppies that talk.  From Budderball who's obsessed with food to the meditating Bud-Dha and the dirt-loving Mudbud, each of the puppies is as unique as a sibling can be.  When it comes time to adopt the young puppies into new families, humans and dogs alike are distraught and the puppies decide to run away.  Enter a spoiled rich boy named Bartleby who wants Air Bud as a birthday present, a dim-witted cousin, and a doltish thug employed by Bartleby's father, and mayhem prevails as Buddy and Molly get dog-napped and Noah, Henry, and the runway puppies all set out to rescue them.  As the chase winds over the river, through the woods, to the drive in movie, and straight through the farmyard, slapstick comedy and satire reign and the whole gang learns an important lesson about the value of teamwork, love, and courage.  While children ages 3 to 10 will delight in the capers of these cute talking puppies, most adults will find the plot predictable and the action less than riveting.  Talent includes Don Knotts, Richard Karn, and Michael Clarke Duncan.--Tami Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001ILFUC8", "B000XUOIQE", "B006070RQ4", "B00267N3E0", "B004YHRZJE", "B003F3NDVW", "B002WN8INY", "B0019ESNG4", "B007TGOJLE", "B00BM4Q4FI", "B004YHRZM6", "B006070RT6", "B003E4B0H6", "B008C3AW78", "B001ILFUCS", "1423169468", "B000093FHC", "B00267N3EA", "B00BJLDJ2U", "1423169751", "B006070RVE", "B0000639HP", "B000R7G6HM", "B008C0C23I", "B007U4DIM6", "B003E4B0GW", "B00005JKVU", "B001CTDH4Y", "B005GP7EYE", "1423171713", "1423184084", "B000G75AZC", "B003VADRRY", "B0043CT8KO", "B008R65XKG", "B0049GYXGI", "B002PB4I3W", "B00EIRFGSW", "B00EIRFHT0", "1423175778", "B001GZM46G", "B0000764FF", "B000059TCD", "B005IMHI82", "B00HLTD2OE", "B00069A5D2", "B0043CT8KY", "B0009ZE9XU", "B0007PIDBQ", "B000P0J088", "B008UYPDCS", "B000CQ98FU", "B000Y11B7G", "B00005NQGL", "B0034G4OT0", "6304711913", "B00G5G7EXY", "B00JK532YW", "B00596WFDK", "B000FKP3XY", "B002PLMJ5G", "B00000JL8E", "B00JK531ES", "B000OPPAD8", "B001ILFUD2", "B0000524D0", "B0000633U3", "B0000633U6", "B0000CABC8", "B00DNF1RDI", "B000Y9PC7S", "B001FTIJS0", "B00E00OGE2", "B00ABUV1GQ", "B00H0KD44M", "142382217X", "B00HLTD2ZS", "142313771X", "B007SO319S", "B00I6JOD2S", "B0015XWUAY", "B0081VMY3G", "B0007Z0NYG", "B00H5RYIBI", "B005FLSZQU", "B00CTQWIYO", "B000YERP2S", "B00AKGG6E8", "B00G5G7K7O", "B00F522C7C", "B00005LB87", "B0007TKGX0", "B000Z6RHAU", "B00H5RYN5Y", "B00E9ZATJO", "B00005JMFH", "B00009L4S2", "B0000DZTL1"], "bought_together": ["B001ILFUC8", "B000XUOIQE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B006070RQ4", "B004YHRZJE", "B000XUOIQE", "B001ILFUC8"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 12606}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.88, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B000HWZ4QG", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/519PgXxT9PL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Air Buddies"}

{"description": "By the timeSeinfeldreached season 7, it was already firmly established as one of the top shows on TV. But Jerry Seinfeld and series co-creator Larry David still had plenty of stops to pull out to keep the show at the top of its form. This is the season where George--yes, George (Jason Alexander)--gets engaged. Elaine (Julia Louis Dreyfuss) judges her dates to see who is \"sponge-worthy.\" Jerry deals with low-flow showerheads, buys Chinese gum, and tries to date Debra Messing. And Kramer (Michael Richards) solidifies his own essential Kramer-ness by putting a hot tub in his living room, going around town in Joseph&#x92;s Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, buying jeans so tight he can&#x92;t take them off, and taking advice on court strategy from his caddy. If there is a unifying theme in this season, it would be growing up (or rather, futile attempts to grow up), as Jerry whines to George right off the bat, \"What are we doing? What kinds of lives are these? We&#x92;re like children, we&#x92;re not men.\" As a result, marriage emerges as a theme, and George proposes to Susan (Heidi Swedburg) in episode 1. And because George is, well, George, things inevitably go downhill from there. But it&#x92;s not all navel-gazing. After all, this is the season that gave us \"The Soup Nazi,\" and years later, \"no soup for you\" is a still a pop-culture touchstone.Other classics include \"The Calzone\" where Jerry points out that Elaine&#x92;s boyfriend never asked her out; \"The Bottle Deposit,\" featuring Kramer teaming with Jerry&#x92;s nemesis, Newman (Wayne Knight), to make millions out of a bottle deposit scheme; and \"The Cadillac,\" where Jerry&#x92;s gift of a Cadillac to his parents inevitably leads to trouble, to name just a few. In due course through the season, all attempts to grow up inevitably, and hilariously, fail. That seems to be the world of Seinfeldian existentialism. Seven seasons in, who wants to see these characters actually change, anyway when it&#x92;s so much more fun to watch them flail in their own skins? Along with the episodes, commentary, and \"Notes about Nothing,\" as on the other seasons, there&#x92;s a nice profile of Julia Louis Dreyfuss and her character Elaine, who was so key to the show&#x92;s success, and \"Larry David&#x92;s Farewell,\" a special feature reviewing David&#x92;s contributions to the show. --Daniel VanciniStills fromSeinfeld(click for larger image)MoreSeinfeldat Amazon.comSeinfeldSeasons 1-6Seinfeld and Philosophythe bookJerry Seinfeld Live on BroadwayAll Seasons ofSeinfeld", "related": {"also_bought": ["B008LCRABQ", "B008LCRAC0", "B008LCRA7K", "B008LCRAFC", "B0007YXRCW", "B0002UE1WQ", "B00005JLEX", "B0002UE1X0", "B0000E2PVR", "B0002WZTLQ", "B000BNTM46", "B000T22PVG", "B000BBOUF4", "B00CJ7Y1CK", "B0001BS3IY", "B000VXK6Z0", "B0000C2IXN", "B000M341S2", "B00070HK4C", "B0000CGNEC", "B00067BCB8", "B002OOWKSA", "B005D0OHA6", "B003TNW030", "B007KFZ8AA", "B000GRU09S", "B008XAT118", "B00BXTH474", "B009LDD4BO", "B000K4X5QM", "B0006ZM8M2", "B005S97V82", "B00FEVZ960", "B004SIP8ZM", "B000067S1G", "B005CGI4EG", "B001MVYUSO", "B0001AW066", "B002N5N4PS", "B003L77GMO", "B003TNW04Y", "B00533K1H6", "B000A7PKGW", "B000CNE0TC", "B000NA1W3Q", "B0007WFXL2", "B000RO6JZY", "B0002Y4T7O", "B0001ZWLVU", "B000OHZKZ4", "B000NOKFH6", "B000VDDE0Y", "B003TNW03K", "B000E1MXWS", "B001B7CNZ6", "B00005JM3G", "B000EXDS34", "B000GPIPTM", "B00INLE5K4", "B001DHXT5C", "B003YLM79E", "B000CNE0SS", "B001DMVZJ4", "B0007YMVWO", "B0007R4SWC", "B007KFZ8B4", "B0001US8EE", "B000P6YNSO", "B001JAHSKU", "B0000844MI", "B00BUWD7Y8", "B000NA1VI2", "B00008PW1F", "B0081QF6LS", "B0019D151K", "B000B5XOTS", "B000BO7DWI", "B00000IQC2", "B00DXLO0D6", "B00GLT2SOA", "B0006Q93AQ", "B001VPJZ0O", "B00FR23O4U", "B000AJJNJK", "B00FM4S7P4", "B001A4VH2U", "B004YM6JSW", "B00005NOHO", "B000R9YLKY", "B005IA9JQ8", "B000FIMG5Y", "B009LDD1X0", "B0024FAD9W", "B0053O89JM", "B000MGBSEY", "B00I099K4U", "B000063US5", "B0009S4J3M", "B00005JLSB", "B00AEBB9ZK"], "bought_together": ["B008LCRABQ", "B008LCRAC0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B008LCRAFC", "B008LCRABQ", "B008LCRA7K", "B0002UE1WQ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 44596}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 13.15, "brand": "Columbia Tri Star", "asin": "B000IFRT4C", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51WSPJRr3TL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Seinfeld: Season 7"}

{"description": "Out patrolling a California highway, police officer Edward Malus (Nicolas Cage) stops a station wagon to return a little girl's lost doll. Moments later, a runaway truck slams into the station wagon, igniting it into a fiery wreck with the mother and child trapped inside. Edward fails to save them before the car explodes...and then spends months of his life choking down pills to get the image of their faces out of his head. But Edward is about to get a second chance. A desperate letter from his former girlfriend, Willow (Kate Beahan), arrives at his home with no postmark. Willow came into his life and left just as unexpectedly years before. But now, her daughter Rowan has gone missing, and Edward is theonly person she trusts to help locate her. She asks him to come to her home on a private island - Summersisle - a place with its own traditions where people observe a forgotten way of life. Edward seizes the opportunity to make his life right again, and soon finds himself on a seaplane bound for the islands of the Pacific Northwest. But nothing is what it seems on isolated Summersisle, where a culture, dominated by its matriarch Sister Summersisle (Ellen Burstyn), is bound together by arcane traditions and a pagan festival called \"the Day of Death and Rebirth.\" The secretive people of Summersisle only ridicule his investigation, insisting that a child named Rowan never existed there... or if she ever did was no longer alive. But what Edward doesn't know is that Willow's plea for help has invited more into his life than a chance for redemption. In unraveling Summersisle's closely held secrets, Edward is drawn into a web of ancient traditions and murderous deceit, and each step he takes closer to the lost child brings him one step closer to the unspeakable. And one step closer to the Wicker Man.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001J710Y8", "B000PMFRZQ", "B002TVQ48K", "B000GRUMRS", "B0073U2ETK", "B001J710Z2", "B004EPYZOO", "B00012QLB4", "B000TGJ8CQ", "B001KRVLCI", "B000CSUNQQ", "B001GCUO02", "B00AEBB8JM", "B000CFYAMC", "6304806434", "B004XFZ4JK", "B000OVLBF8", "B000BBOUW2", "B000BYA5G4", "B000059TG6", "B004EI2NMM", "B00BFNJHCI", "B00004Z4WR", "B001KKU9CI", "0792838068", "6304711891", "B003ZD9DSO", "B00BJB2GZG", "B00003CXIV", "6305760403", "B00BTYMPX6", "B000U7169M", "B00IKM5LXG", "B001DZOC6Y", "B007IUEEA2", "B00062IDGK", "B00003CXXG", "B003YF9PX6", "B00092ZLSK", "B00005JLRE", "B000TJ6PBK", "B00441GZ00", "B005F2JRUC", "0792844831", "B000FI8MPW", "B0000AGWMF", "B00005JN5E", "0767810856", "B000YNFXZA", "B000OVLBGM", "B00006LPGP", "B00020HAX8", "B0010YVCB6", "B0009X763M", "B00005JP3R", "B000RZGHSM", "B000EHRVP6", "B00008L3UF", "B000286S1U", "B00DNJ95S8", "B009L79YFU", "B00KCTG4PO", "B005DR64OQ", "B0019X3YX2", "B000RZGHSW", "B00406UK7S", "B000JLTRIQ", "B003UMW63O", "B0047T74CM", "B000ALM40I", "B008XAT0TQ", "B002GHHHKG", "B009XTF8KQ", "B001OST0M6", "B009IV2Z3M", "B002ZG99KO", "B00E8G5HNM", "B0002DB5PO", "B00HOGBXS6", "B008DVJOQ4", "B004SIP92O", "B00AEBBA2W", "B00I9H3VTS", "B0011NVC98", "B001JNNDJM", "B000W1SZA4", "B00FEHCQEC", "B00AEFYYH6", "B005LAIGW8", "B00005JNNT", "B004CQZFH6", "B000U1ZV62", "B000RGN2JI", "B003L20IEW", "B00006FDBT", "B00004Y87O", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00803PFZO", "B00GOYC3I8"], "bought_together": ["B001J710Y8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001J710Y8", "B00004Z4WR", "B002TVQ48K", "B000PMFRZQ"]}, "price": 9.33, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 75218}, "asin": "B000JYW5DM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51TT3AM10VL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Wicker Man (Full Screen Unrated/Rated Edition)"}
{"description": "There's plenty to like aboutHawaii Five-0, the late '60s cop show debuting on DVD by way of this seven-disc set including all episodes from the first season, along with the two-hour pilot that preceded it. Like the music, featuring Morton Stevens' popular theme song. Or the lovely Hawaiian scenery. And let's not forget \"Book 'em, Danno,\" the signature line delivered (although not nearly as frequently as one might expect) by star Jack Lord's Steve McGarrett, not to mention Lord's perfect hair and wrinkle-free slacks. As for everything else, let's just say thatHawaii Five-0has not aged well. Some of that is inevitably due to the infinitely more sophisticated production values of the series that have followed in its wake;Five-0's technology, sets, and other practical elements are laughably primitive by current standards. Problem is, the cheese factor extends to pretty much every other aspect of the show as well. Most of the action sequences are utterly tension-free, and the pace is frequently glacial, with interminable scenes bogged down by talky exposition. The dialogue is risible: McGarrett refers to one adversary as \"a dirty, double-dealing fink,\" while the so-called hippies who populate the islands utter the kind of idiocies that could only have been written by cubes whose closest contact with the counterculture came from TV commercials for Hai Karate men's cologne (\"Looks like splittin' the scene was real cool, baby\" is but one egregious example). Lord does a decent job as the stiff-but-heroic McGarrett, variously described as \"a hardhead,\" \"an organizational misfit,\" \"a brilliant operator,\" and \"a rebel,\" but by and large the acting (including guest shots by Sal Mineo, Ricardo Montalban, Gavin MacLeod, and Yaphet Kotto) is wooden. Story-wise, \"Cocoon,\" the pilot, features an intriguing premise wherein U.S. intelligence agents undergo sensory-deprivation torture before spilling their secrets; elsewhere, the elite Five-0 team deals with jewel thieves, gold smugglers, kidnappers, gamblers, murderers, mobsters, all-purpose \"criminal masterminds,\" and even \"Red agents\" spreading the bubonic plague. In sum: with its light (if not quite frothy) tone,Hawaii Five-0will offer harmless escapism to some viewers, especially those with a nostalgic bent. Others, however, will long for more substantial fare--you know, likeDeal or No Deal.  The DVD set includes a single bonus feature: \"Emme's Island Moments: Memories ofHawaii Five-O,\" a retrospective with James \"Danno\" MacArthur and other cast and crew members.--Sam GrahamBeyondHawaii Five-0Virtual Hawaii DVD ListMore &#x91;60s TV SeriesMore TV Series on DVD for the First TimeStills fromHawaii Five-0: The Complete First Season(click for larger image)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000PGTPC8", "B000WQWPSM", "B0014FAIXE", "B001DHXT7U", "B001S86IYK", "B002JIOOAS", "B0030Y12BO", "B003KSO3R0", "B00471JT0K", "B004MLEYV4", "B001JAHQGG", "B000HWZ4HU", "B00005JMHI", "B00005JNHT", "B000NOIX66", "B002XKKX8E", "B0014FAIVG", "B00005JO3P", "B000UX6TJI", "B000LV6VZQ", "B0002COTDA", "B000BGR1B4", "B003R4ZMNQ", "B001675ZJM", "B006JN86V2", "B0007LXP86", "B000LXGXY8", "B0055CP9P4", "B000LV6W00", "B000BF0C8E", "B0012Z36FI", "B001S86IZE", "B005PYHNQU", "B000RZIGTA", "B000N2HD6O", "B000BUE5DC", "B000F48D0U", "B000EHSVB4", "B001JFKWE4", "B00005JLEY", "B00308B170", "B0077T5SG8", "B000XJD3K2", "B000IHYXJO", "B000ASDFIG", "B003CNQPMY", "B0013PVGGI", "B00006J6XH", "B001BN4WI6", "B005SQRYS2", "B0009UC80Q", "B0089BSNQA", "B001B187C0", "B000MQ4WNS", "B002WQ79A4", "B001FT4PEW", "B008X8U83K", "B000GRU09I", "B000CELOV8", "B000PHX5KU", "B00CYQXETM", "B004916TRE", "B00DYQ1G78", "B000E5KQMI", "B001UDPA9C", "B00553K9NA", "B000O59A52", "B00005JNHU", "B00AX5B0RY", "B001J2XROY", "B00915G4IC", "B00018D3RI", "B0009UC80G", "B0007CNY4K", "B00114XTHK", "B000UAE7DQ", "B003BGZ60Y", "B00J2G4ZAY", "B001JTRKHW", "B007KW5M6I", "B001675ZJW", "B00006J6XI", "B000ERVJKO", "B0096W46PS", "B000RZIGSQ", "B002JIOOD0", "B002L9N4E2", "B001E6HUWK", "B00008WJEZ", "B002DPH91I", "B004IB04S0", "B0007V6IWQ", "B00IS6WQ2S", "B005LFQRTC", "B001675ZJ2", "B00DZP1C18", "B001E6HUW0", "B000AL733G", "B000W8OM68", "B002ZTLVXY"], "bought_together": ["B000PGTPC8", "B000WQWPSM"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001DHXT7U", "B002JIOOAS", "B000PGTPC8", "B0030Y12BO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 19787}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 16.43, "brand": "Paramount Pictures", "asin": "B000LE16VC", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51JT2Y6F4DL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Hawaii Five-O: Season 1"}
