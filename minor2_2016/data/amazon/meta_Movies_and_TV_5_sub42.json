{"description": "Lamberto Bava, son of the Italian horror legend andgiallogodfather Mario Bava, teamed up with modern master Dario Argento (cowriter and producer) for this slick gorefest, a triumph of style and special effects over movie logic. Set in a refurbished German movie palace, our hapless soon-to-be victims arrive for a sneak preview of a horror movie only to see the gore unfold in the audience, as well as onscreen.  While the exposition remains murky, one patron finds that an infected cut leads to a gooey transformation, and every one of her victims follows suit until the snaggle-toothed monsters outnumber the humans. The survivors, trapped in the tomb of a theater, must fend off attacks &agrave; la George Romero'sNight of the Living Dead. Borrowing liberally from films such asDawn of the DeadandThe Tingler,Demonsalso anticipatesScreamin its cinema-savvy references, not to mention its undeniably Neve Campbell-ish heroine. The blaring heavy-metal-hard-rock soundtrack and the carnival horror-house atmosphere helps remind us that this is all just stupid fun.  Despite the overwhelming body count, excessive gore, and rivers of green demon pus, the cartoonishly grotesque killings avoid the sadistic edge of many Italian horror films. By the climax of the film the premise is long forgotten in a ghoul apocalypse, but who's watching this for the story anyway?--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303442315", "630428845X", "6300262855", "B0032GEL54", "0764005693", "6305807426", "0792836634", "6302921058", "6304147074", "6305972060", "B000TZJCOG", "6303018351", "6303257879", "6302038286", "0764005685", "B004N7NJ0Y", "B000IJ7A60", "6304451032"], "also_viewed": ["6303442315", "B00000F6FN", "B0018Q7K3K", "6304243324", "6304370458", "B007H9OORW", "6301708695"]}, "price": 36.23, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 191017}, "asin": "0764005707", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/513NCW0ATNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Demons [VHS]"}
{"description": "Sally Potter's self-reflective film stars Potter (an actress and the director ofOrlando), more or less as herself, learning to tango from master dancer Pablo Veron and considering making a film calledThe Tango Lesson. The film that we happen to be watching, however, is concerned largely with the delicious conflict between the politics of tango--the need for one partner, typically the woman, to yield to the other--and the expectations of the filmmaker to do things on her own terms. Can Potter simultaneously surrender and control for the duration of this circular project? The question is made more complicated by Veron's desire to be in one of Potter's films--in other words, to follow her lead. Potter may not be Veron's equal on the dance floor, but that isn't the point of this interesting movie and its provocative, internal debate.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000B6CO5C"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 300215}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.94, "brand": "", "asin": "0767800958", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51A5Z7MWFEL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Tango Lesson [VHS]"}

{"description": "For all of its conventional plotting about an obsessive-compulsive curmudgeon (Jack Nicholson) who improves his personality at the urging of his gay neighbor (Greg Kinnear) and a waitress (Helen Hunt) who inspires his best behavior, this is one of the sharpest Hollywood comedies of the 1990s. Nicholson could play his role in his sleep (the Oscar he won should have gone to Robert Duvall forThe Apostle), but his mischievous persona is precisely necessary to give heart to his seemingly heartless character, who is of all things a successful romance novelist. As a single mom with a chronically asthmatic young son, Hunt gives the film its conscience and integrity (along with plenty of wry humor), and she also won an Oscar for her wonderful performance. Greg Kinnear had to settle for an Oscar nomination (while cowriter-director James L. Brooks was inexplicably snubbed by Oscar that year), but his work was also singled out in the film's near-unanimous chorus of critical praise. It's questionable whether a romance between Hunt and the much older Nicholson is entirely believable, but this movie's smart enough--and charmingly funny enough--to make it seem endearingly possible.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0001AVZA8", "B000YAF4MA", "0800141741", "B004FQX5B6", "B0000YEEGM", "B0038N9WKU", "B000FVQLQQ", "B00AEBB9WI", "B00005JLSK", "0783226845", "B0000AOV4I", "B000YDBPAM", "B000XJD33O", "B004SIP7ZS", "B00081U7HC", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00AEBB8YW", "B00003CXFV", "B001ECDVK4", "6305212112", "B000EHRVOW", "B00009Y3PV", "6304765266", "B00004RJ73", "B005F2JRUC", "0783225733", "B00AEFXYOA", "6305236569", "B000OCZA04", "B000FFJYBG", "B003ASLJK4", "0792833198", "B000JYW5B4", "B00012QLB4", "B00BTYRB3U", "B0043X1FL8", "B000055Y0Y", "B00005B6JZ", "B000EHQU0S", "B00AEBB9UK", "B00008G7UF", "B0002B15ZG", "B00005JG6N", "B001MBTTNA", "B001ECDVJU", "B00003CWQR", "B00AEFY4CG", "630471193X", "B002GHHHP6", "B00AEBB9NM", "B0000A02TZ", "0767821769", "B00569I5BQ", "B00AEFYSWM", "B00AEFXYJA", "B000XT1P3E", "B002GHHHGU", "B00026ZG10", "6305128952", "B00005OLYF", "B001LMAK9W", "B000N6U0E2", "B000EMGJ7C", "B000023VTP", "B00CPTUOI2", "B004SIP9U6", "B00001ZWUS", "B003BV8ICC", "B0043X1FM2", "B0013XZ2QK", "B00AEFXT1S", "B00AEBB9FA", "B007SPPANM", "B00005JM4Q", "B007N31YH0", "B000VECAD0", "B00003CXO1", "B00009WVSL", "B00003CXSM", "B000NA1WDQ", "B00004BZIY", "B002AS464Q", "B000J103OI", "B000021Y7L", "B000ENC5YW", "B0002V7ON8", "B00009W5CA", "B00015YVDG", "B0009X75O2", "B0000JBALO", "0767803434", "6305065551", "B000MQC9H4", "6305692572", "B00013RC2U", "6305144168", "B00008979G", "B000CCBCAS", "0792846443", "B000M341QE"], "bought_together": ["B0001AVZA8", "B000YAF4MA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0001AVZA8", "B0038N9WKU", "B000YAF4MA", "B00013WWT8"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 5469}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.96, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "0767811100", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51KRRMHSAJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "As Good As It Gets"}
{"description": "As \"gigantic monster reptile attacks New York\" movies go, you've got to admit thatGodzilladelivers the goods, although its critical drubbing and box-office disappointment were arguably deserved. It's a shameless, uninspired crowd pleaser that's content to serve up familiar action with the advantage of really fantastic special effects, and if you expect nothing more you'll be one among millions of satisfied customers. There's really no other way to approach it--you just have to accept the fact thatIndependence Daycreators Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin are unapologetic plagiarists, incapable of anything more than mindless spectacle that can play in any cinema in the world without dubbing or subtitles. The whole movie plays out like a series of highlights stolen from previous blockbusters of the 1990s; it's little more than a rehash of theJurassic Parkmovies. The derivative script is so trivial that it's unworthy of comment, apart from a few choice laughs and the casting of Michael Lerner as New York's mayor, whose name is Ebert and who closely resembles a certain well-known movie critic. Perhaps that's a clever hint that this movie's essentially critic-proof. It's stupid but it's fun, and for most audiences that's a fitting definition of mainstream Hollywood entertainment. The widescreen Special Edition DVD includes a wealth of bonus materials--audio commentary by the film's special effects supervisors, a \"making of\" featurette, the Wallflowers' music video \"Heroes,\" a photo gallery, and a variety of features related to this and all the classicGodzillafilms from Japan.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00003CXLS", "B000P24FAE", "B000VXWK86", "B000H30B2C", "B0000VAGXU", "B00066KWCY", "B00I462X7K", "B00003L9CB", "B0001AVZ9Y", "0767825489", "B00I462Y60", "B0000VAGXK", "B0006SGYLK", "B00I099JZK", "B00I462XF2", "B000MV8AJK", "B0088FS1DC", "B009ERJY6G", "B00IE41A9O", "B00AEFYEU8", "B000BMY2L0", "B00K2CHW48", "B00003L9CE", "B00E8G5HQE", "B0002V7OI8", "B00125WAYQ", "0767802497", "B00JB08O76", "B005VU9LO0", "B00008G8M4", "B000E1BXFG", "B001AR0D40", "B000MV8AJU", "B0087ZG7J8", "B007WETMRY", "B000OCY7IU", "6305320950", "B000OCY7IK", "B00125WAYG", "B0087ZG7NO", "B000EHQTZO", "B0093QC3SY", "B001YYQ9S8", "B00B2M7DKA", "B00005A8XX", "B00I099JO6", "B00I3C1T6G", "B00006FD9K", "B007STBUHI", "B002GHHHL0", "B00008WFU4", "B00005R1O7", "B00AEFXPMG", "0783225547", "B00000G3PA", "B00003CXTA", "B00005O5B5", "B0041N72PI", "B00BG4RKL6", "B000OVLBHG", "B0002IQLH6", "B00IQAUO48", "B00IQAUO5C", "B00005JNTI", "B00005JMXX", "B00008WFU5", "B0088FS27C", "B0002B15WY", "B0087ZG7HK", "B0045HCJ0S", "B0024FAG2G", "B000ASATZ8", "B00260HH3K", "B004XVMCN0", "B000F6IOC0", "B00008G8M5", "0780622650", "B000B7MX6Q", "0783231644", "B0068FZ0O2", "B00IQAUO6Q", "B00IQAUO2A", "B00AEFYSR2", "0790738511", "B008JFUPFI", "B00AEFYXQI", "B000R1A0LG", "B000RXVNDI", "B002HTCOCO", "B000056PMU", "B009MF5BXK", "B005G4TJUC", "B0045HCJ9O", "B0006HBZYC", "B000IJ79UW", "B00AEFYUQQ", "B005VU9LKE", "B00IAO618S", "B000BYY11Y", "B000EHSVPK"], "bought_together": ["B000P24FAE", "B000VXWK86"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00003CXLS", "B00K2CHW48", "B0034G4ORC", "B00177YA1K"]}, "price": 6.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 8109}, "asin": "0767817478", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51xvBMPeK6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Godzilla"}

{"description": "One of the best romantic comedies of the 1990s,My Best Friend's Weddingnot only gave Julia Roberts a delightful vehicle for her crowd-pleasing comeback, but it further distinguished itself by avoiding the conventional plotting of the genre. Julia plays a prominent Chicago restaurant critic whose best friend (Dermot Mulroney) is a former lover from her college days with whom she'd made a binding pact: if neither of them were married by the age of 28, they'd marry each other. Just when they're about to reach the deadline of their agreement, Mulroney arrives in Chicago to introduce Roberts to his seemingly perfect fianc&eacute;e (Cameron Diaz) and announce their wedding in just three days. That leaves the shocked Julia with just three short days to sabotage the wedding and marry the man she now realizes she's loved all along. With potential heartbreak waiting in the wings, she'll either get what she wants or pay the price for her selfish behavior, and Ronald Bass's cleverly constructed screenplay keeps us guessing to the very end. Rupert Everett scored rave reviews for his scene-stealing performance as Robert's gay friend who goes along with her scheming (but only so far), and even as she makes her character's needy desperation disarmingly appealing, Roberts wisely allows Diaz to capitalize on her charming time in the spotlight. As the romantic outcome remains uncertain, the viewer is held in a state of giddy suspense, and director P.J. Hogan pulls off some hilarious scenes (like a restaurant full of people singing the Dionne Warwick hit \"I Say a Little Prayer\") that could easily have fallen flat in the hands of a less talented filmmaker. It's no surprise that this was one of the box-office smashes of 1997.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEBB8NS", "B00003CXSM", "B0009OL7Z4", "B00081U7HC", "B000023VTP", "B00386EZKE", "0767821769", "B0045HCJJ4", "B0015I2RT8", "B00006FMUW", "B001TUZD8O", "B0007RT9M6", "B000ELJAEM", "6304765266", "B00003CXFV", "B000CCBCAS", "B00466HN7M", "B001AKTZW8", "B0000AOV4I", "B000YDBPAM", "B0000DIXDR", "B002K0WBXW", "B000BKVQS4", "B00009WVSL", "B000A343RI", "B00AEBB8YW", "B00AEBB9WI", "B00AEFY4CG", "B00AEFY99O", "B000XT1P3E", "B001ECDVK4", "B00004TJKK", "B004SIP9RO", "B00006ZXSO", "B000053VB4", "B000MQC9H4", "B00006ZXSN", "B00007E2F5", "B00008NRI7", "B000XJD33O", "B00AEFXYOA", "B002AS464Q", "B001KWRBH2", "B00BLN4UDS", "B0045DO83I", "B00005JPQE", "B000KGGIZA", "B002NZK5UU", "B00006ZXSL", "B00EEW1D2Y", "6305236569", "B00003CXO1", "B0001ADAVK", "0767811100", "B004EPZ070", "B0001AVZA8", "B0000897EG", "B000EHRVOW", "B00005O5CM", "B0007PLLBU", "6305428034", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00006ZXSQ", "B00447L4KA", "B00003CXTG", "6305428425", "B004SEUJK0", "0783235070", "B00AKGG6JS", "B0000VD02Y", "B00005T7I2", "B002ZG988M", "B00007BKVC", "6305213283", "B00006ZXSK", "0767803434", "B0000DZ6N3", "B00005Y1UV", "0800141741", "6305428395", "B00005JPSM", "B00006HAWN", "B00KNALRZ4", "B00003CY5G", "B004SIP8JI", "B00006AW0I", "B00008G7UF", "B000RO9PU0", "B00008G7UI", "B00005Y1UX", "0783226772", "B00002SSKI", "B00AMEZDJW", "078322740X", "6305213305", "B003BV8ICC", "B0042816YK", "B0000YEEGM", "B000HEWEE4", "B003Y5H524"], "bought_together": ["B00AEBB8NS", "B00386EZKE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00386EZKE", "B00006FMUW", "B00081U7HC", "6304765266"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 198584}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.89, "brand": "ROBERTS,JULIA", "asin": "0767802683", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Z8P4CFVRL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "My Best Friend's Wedding"}
{"description": "Based on a story by Clive Barker and skillfully written and directed by Bernard Rose,Candymanrises above most horror films by eerily suggesting that some urban legends--in this case a particularly frightening one--have a spooky basis in reality. The legend of the Candyman is a potent one around the high-rise tenements of Chicago's Cabrini-Green housing complex, where the residents speak of a dark, ominous figure who appears when his victims say his name five times in front of a mirror, then mercilessly slashes them to death. Upon learning that the Candyman is rumored to live in one of the vacant tenements, a University of Illinois researcher (Virginia Madsen) investigates a recent murder at Cabrini-Green. She learns that the Candyman (played by Tony Todd) is both unreal and chillingly real--a supernatural force of evil empowered by those who believe in his legend. He is a killer made flesh by the belief of others, and the young researcher's investigation is a threat to his existence. What happens next? We wouldn't dare spoil the chills, but rest assured that writer-director Rose has tapped into a wellspring of urban angst and fear, andCandymanserves up its gruesome frights with a refreshing dose of intelligence.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005K3NZ", "6305622760", "B001B8XRT6", "B000MNOX8U", "B008874968", "B000A6T1ZY", "B004AC6PMG", "B001B1UO6W", "B00005NRN6", "B000GBEWRU", "B000V4UFZK", "B0000AOX0D", "B000I2J68M", "6305972001", "B001B1872A", "B0000AOX0E", "B00006FDCD", "B000FS9FE4", "B001DJLD1W", "B005CFBZQ6", "B000099T3M", "B000RIWAVW", "B005OT810I", "B000MV8ABS", "B000EHRVP6", "B00006IUFV", "B0000AOX0A", "B001NPD9LS", "B000IMUYJM", "B001DJLD0S", "1573628174", "B0052XU4BK", "B003UGLCIA", "B00079Z9WI", "B000PMLJMQ", "B00009PY4G", "B000A2X3U2", "B0053TWVDC", "B002HML6YI", "B00005YUNE", "B00006FDBT", "B000VKL6Z2", "B000MV8AC2", "B001AGNMFI", "B00AEFYV9W", "B00018D42W", "B0013D8LAE", "B0002IQLH6", "B002LMSWN2", "B00005UQ9W", "B000S0GYRU", "B004EI2NP4", "B00AEFYYH6", "B000WC3864", "B0000CEB6Y", "B000FWHW86", "B0053TWVIM", "B006ZL1P66", "B00AEFY2LO", "B000N4RAQU", "B000TSIJWY", "B008CYDD7I", "B000FA57UI", "B0056P6SOG", "B002JT69IW", "B00CERJI5U", "B002ZG971U", "B0001EFV7M", "B002OVO18A", "0767817664", "B00006AUIG", "B005CFBZVG", "B00005NKSC", "B0000D9PNG", "B00005RHGK", "0792839706", "B00005LC4Q", "B004P7CM9Q", "B00JF5GAIW", "B00AQJ8MLY", "B002I41KNC", "B00KDU8HQQ", "B00001QGUM", "B0024FADD8", "B00DTPRZ24", "B001JV5BIA", "B003PIUINI", "B002VWNIDG", "B0021L8UPS", "B004LWZW24", "B003PIUINS", "B000Q66Q2O", "B00005K3NR", "0783230451", "B0006SGYL0", "B00023P4SS", "B0002VYOVS", "B0087ZG7UW", "B005CFBYW6", "B00006FI0R"], "bought_together": ["B00005K3NZ", "6305622760"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001B8XRT6", "6305972001", "B00004TDTO", "B001B1UO6W"]}, "price": 17.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 183485}, "asin": "0767817656", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DGRV60NAL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Candyman"}

{"description": "Until Sam Fuller came along, movies in the 1960s were still  bound by Hollywood's self-imposed and often hypocritical rules of  discretion. The crimes and misdemeanors of lurid pulp fiction remained  on drugstore spin-racks and newsstands, diluted on screen until Fuller,  with his cigar-chomping audacity and confrontational style, liberated  movies from artificial restraint and kicked them into the meaner,  darker, but more honest maturity of the post-Kennedy era.Shock  Corridorannounced Fuller's brazen agenda a year earlier, butThe Naked Kissis even more astonishing because its trashy,  provocative plot dares to find depth and humanity beneath the hardened  shells of corrupted souls.The film begins like no other before it: Kelly (Constance Towers) beats  her pimp with a handbag, grabs the cash he owes her, adjusts her  telltale wig and makeup, and sets out to begin life anew, free from the  shame of prostitution. Two years later she's in Grantville, a typically  Rockwellian slice of Americana, working wonders with disabled kids and  gaining distance from her miserable past. She's even engaged to the  town's most respected citizen, but dark clouds are gathering: a corrupt  cop knows Kelly's hidden secrets; a nearby brothel taints the  community; and a pedophile is lurking in the shadows. Through it all,  Fuller calibratesThe Naked Kisswith such precision that  sentiment and sordidness can run parallel without colliding, shifting  from outrageous vice to shameless tear-jerking with equal facility.  With twisted tricks up his sleeve, Fuller can be accused of tabloid  tackiness, but that would be missing the point: In Fuller's cruel and  ugly world, compassion still finds a way to survive.--Jeff  Shannon", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 238652}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "title": "The Naked Kiss (The Criterion Collection)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0047P5FU4", "B00AQ6J5YA", "B000QXDFS0", "B0024FAG6W", "B00012L786", "B00005AUK9", "B001GCATWA", "B00ICWO1LC", "B004C2523M", "B0006Z2NE0", "B0007PALOI", "B00DZP1C9K", "B0024FAG80", "B00005AUKD", "B0007TKNLA", "078002205X", "B00180R072", "B00D9BNONW", "B000M2E3GI", "B00005BHW6", "B000BB14IA", "B00DZP1BVO", "B005HK13S6", "B00005JKGX", "B0007MANYY", "B000B83846", "B00000C0QO", "B000FKO3VW", "B00E18QKJ2", "B00JX3SHIC", "B0024FAG8A", "B000NO1XJA", "B0007ZEO8C", "B003N2CVOU", "B000EXDSBQ", "B00DZP1BUU", "B00CUKTGSA", "B009X919UE", "B000AQKUH2", "B000PKG6OE", "0780022823", "0783225903", "B005152C9G", "B006X0ZN3K", "6305918880", "B000KJTGFG", "B003TYK0T0", "B000MTEFOQ", "B007N5YK10", "B00007ELDG", "B0002JP2OS", "B00I116MVQ", "B009RWRINE", "0780022076", "B0080JG2GE", "B000TGJ82Q", "B001TITGCA", "B000087F79", "B00065GX64", "B00AQ6J64O", "B000B8384Q", "B00005B1ZL", "6305999872", "0780022041", "B0006UEVVI", "B0000A2ZSR", "B005152C7S", "B005SYZZ7Q", "B004WPYO7E", "B000BGH2N6", "B0064MT1FI", "B0000AMRUP", "B002A5KY1I", "B00097DY2A", "B00575GYUI", "B00005RDRL", "B00005A8TX", "B000PMFRVU", "B0089LT800", "B000G8NXYG", "B00005BCK0", "B000244EX8", "B001TIQT6G", "B00005BH23", "B001D8W7F4", "B00CUKTHES", "B000K0YLZ0", "B00AQ6J6H6", "B00005V6N6", "B00004XPPK", "B000067IY4", "B003G9IT3C", "B00H8J2NTC", "B00005JKFX", "B0000694WH", "B00005B1ZK", "B00GBT63IC", "B0000BUZKP", "0780023099", "B003WKL6XA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0047P5FU4", "B00005AUK9", "B005KQVE1S", "B000PKG6OE"]}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5134XF0WV4L._SY300_.jpg", "asin": "0780021088"}

{"description": "The Mack, a 1973 pimping epic, is at once a laughable, schlock classic and a harbinger of more serious black-themed films to come. Starring the now-forgotten Max Julien as Goldie, the preening ex-con whose dream is to rule the streets with a fine Cadillac and a fleet of topnotch hookers, this film is full of whip-crack, mostly improvised dialogue and hilarious stereotypes (the evil white cops, a wisdom-spouting blind man, and more trash-talkin' pimps than you could shake a walking stick at).Not only is the film one you can chuckle at in the postmodern, ironic mode, it is also a window on the world of today's rap superstars, many of whom have sampled, invoked, or quoted lines from this gaudy paean to pandering. In other words,The Mackis a kind of godfather to a future stark frankness about life on the streets. But forget the sociological hooey and dig into the piece as an urban costume picture with a greasy/funky score by R&B; genius Willie Hutch.Also, it features an amazing supporting turn by Richard Pryor, who, playing Tonto to Julien's Lone Ranger, unleashes torrents of nearly incomprehensible verbiage in the film's finest moments. Mind you, such brilliance is a direct comedy-organ transplant from Pryor's stand-up act: he was performing his \"Pimp on Blow\" routine at about the same timeThe Mackwas filmed. Seventy percent of this piece is dross, but the other 30 is the apex of urban surrealism. One vignette to tantalize: Goldie hypnotizing his \"ladies\" into docile submission as they sit in a planetarium, mechanically repeating his words: \"I will remain a lady at all times...\"--David Was", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300269167", "B000053VBA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 401532}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.85, "brand": "", "asin": "078060959X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51F7Q516CVL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Mack [VHS]"}
{"description": "Although it received mixed reactions from critics and audiences alike when released in 1998, this supernatural thriller benefits from a sustained atmosphere of anticipation and dread, and its combination of detective mystery and demonic mischief is handled with ample style and intelligence. Under the direction of Gregory Hoblit (who fared better withPrimal Fear), Denzel Washington plays detective John Hobbes, who witnesses the gas-chamber execution of a serial killer (Elias Koteas). But when another series of murders begins, Hobbes suspects that the killer's evil spirit has survived and is possessing the bodies of others to do its evil bidding. Even Hobbes's trusted partner (John Goodman) thinks the detective is losing his grip on reality, but the dire warnings of a noted linguist (Embeth Davidtz) confirm Hobbes's far-out theory, and his case intensifies toward a fateful showdown. Although its idea is better than its execution, and the story's film noir ambitions are never fully accomplished, this slickly directed thriller has some genuinely effective moments in which evil forces are entwined into the fabric of everyday reality. Among the highlights is a memorable scene in which Detective Hobbes must track the killer as the evil spirit is transferred between many people via physical contact. Even if the film is ultimately less than the sum of its parts, it's an intriguing hybrid that resides in the same cinematic neighborhood asSevenandThe Silence of the Lambswith a cast that also includes Donald Sutherland and James Gandolfini.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783240295", "6304884400", "B00BTYOYG2", "6305065551", "B000OT6V0K", "B00005JPD0", "B000244GCC", "B00011CZRE", "6304765258", "B002NZK5UU", "B00441GZ1Y", "B0006210ZG", "B002LMV7R0", "B0000VJG72", "B002NZK5RI", "B00005JN0W", "B000GFLKF8", "B0001VTPUO", "B0000542CJ", "B000069HZP", "B00096S49Y", "B002ZG997C", "B00005JKWX", "B00005JA9F", "B00006AUJR", "078324228X", "0800141806", "6305718954", "B00AEFXEGS", "B00AEFXT1S", "B0002DB54A", "B00AEFXX9Q", "B001R3YRG2", "B00AFEXRME", "B0009MDPYM", "B0000549B2", "B002VWNIEA", "B005LAIGRS", "B002O3Z4WK", "0767818075", "B00HOGBXS6", "B00BEIYN9Q", "B002AT8KAG", "B00AP2DC94", "B00AEFYF2K", "630514415X", "B000NQRR1Q", "B0001FR3IQ", "B00013RC7K", "B002ZG99TA", "B003BV8I3Q", "B00AEBB8LA", "B002CPMB9O", "B00009WVSL", "0767836286", "B00AEBBA2W", "B000R4SMCW", "B00005JNY3", "B00015YVDG", "B00026ZD04", "B0000648X0", "B002NZK5VO", "6305310335", "B00GS08UDU", "0800177789", "6305428115", "B0034G4P30", "0767817737", "B0045HCJ0S", "B00005Y1UV", "B000P0I4O4", "B00004BZIY", "0783230532", "B001UDS4BS", "6304698747", "B003UGLCIA", "B00005V9HH", "B00005LDDD", "B002AS466O", "0800177967", "B00008L3S6", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00005UQ9W", "0792846443", "B002O3Z4Y8", "B009IV2Z7S", "B00AEBB95K", "B002AS464Q", "B00005JLRZ", "B002T9H2LA", "B00003CWU3", "B001N44BVQ", "B000TGJ80S", "B0001US62I", "B003AWRMCE", "0780618548", "B00JA3RVG4", "B00AEBB89W", "B000P0J0EM"], "bought_together": ["0783240295", "B00011CZRE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0050MB4OO", "B000NA1WEK", "6305065551", "B00005JN0W"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 118059}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 20.25, "brand": "TURNER HM ENTERTAINM", "asin": "0780622537", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71Q7T9SZ5HL._SY300_.gif", "title": "Fallen (Snap Case Packaging)"}
{"description": "Fantastical writer Gary Ross (Big,Dave) makes an  auspicious directorial debut with this inspired and oddly touching comedy about two '90s kids (Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon) thrust into the black-and-white TV world ofPleasantville, aLeave It to Beaver-style sitcom complete with picket fences, corner malt shop, and warm chocolate chip cookies. When a somewhat unusual remote control (provided by repairman Don Knotts) transports them from the jaded real world to G-rated TV land, Maguire and Witherspoon are forced to play along as Bud and Mary Sue, the obedient children of George and Betty Parker (William&nbsp;H. Macy and Joan Allen). Maguire, an obsessivePleasantvilledevotee, understands the need for not toppling the natural balance of things; Witherspoon, on the other hand, starts shaking the town up, most notably when she takes basketball stud Skip (Paul Walker) up to Lover's Lane for some modern-day fun and games. Soon enough, Pleasantville's teens are discovering sex along with--gasp!--rock & roll, free thinking, and soul-changing Technicolor. Filled with delightful and shrewd details about sitcom life (no toilets, no double beds, only two streets in the town),Pleasantvilleis a joy to watch, not only for its comedy but for the groundbreaking visual effects and astonishing production design as the town gradually transforms from crisp black and white to glorious color. Ross does tip his hand a bit about halfway through the film, obscuring the movie's basic message of the unpredictability of life with overloaded and obvious symbolism, as the black-and-white denizens of the town gang up on the \"coloreds\" and impose rules of conduct to keep their strait-laced town laced up. Still, the characterizations from the phenomenal cast--especially repressed housewife Allen and soda-shop owner Jeff Daniels, doing some of their best work ever--will keep you emotionally invested in the film's outcome, and waiting to see Pleasantville in all its final Technicolor glory.--Mark Englehart", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 436957}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.82, "brand": "", "asin": "0780627024", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51C118QWETL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Pleasantville [VHS]"}
{"description": "The plotline may sound familiar: Two mismatched cops are assigned as reluctant partners to solve a crime. Culturally they are complete opposites, and they quickly realize they can't stand each other. One (Jackie Chan) believes in doing things by the book. He is a man with integrity and nerves of steel. The other (Chris Tucker) is an amiable rebel who can't stand authority figures. He's a man who has to do everything on his own, much to the displeasure of his superior officer, who in turn thinks this cop is a loose cannon but tolerates him because he gets the job done. Directed by Brett Ratner,Rush Hourdoesn't break any new ground in terms of story, stunts, or direction. It rehashes just about every \"buddy\" movie ever made--in fact, it makes films such asTango and Cashseem utterly original and clever by comparison. So, why did this uninspired movie make over $120 million at the box office? Was the whole world suffering from temporary insanity? Hardly. The explanation for the success ofRush Houris quite simple: chemistry. The casting of veteran action maestro Jackie Chan with the charming and often hilarious Chris Tucker was a serendipitous stroke of genius. Fans of Jackie Chan may be slightly disappointed by the lack of action set pieces that emphasize his kung-fu craft. On the other hand, those who know the history of this seasoned Hong Kong actor will be able to appreciate thatRush Hourwas the mainstream breakthrough that Chan had deserved for years. Coupled with the charismatic scene-stealer Tucker, Chan gets to flex his comic muscles to great effect. From their first scenes together to the trademark Chan outtakes during the end credits, their ability to play off of one another is a joy to behold, and this mischievous interaction is what saves the film from slipping into the depths of pitiful mediocrity.--Jeremy Storey", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00003CY5X", "B000059XYJ", "B00005JL8Y", "6302091632", "B00006G8LB", "B00000JGEK", "6300213730"], "bought_together": ["B00003CY5X"], "also_viewed": ["B00003CY5X", "B00005JL8Y", "B000WGYMTC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 400219}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.0, "brand": "", "asin": "0780623711", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514DYRWFBKL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Rush Hour [VHS]"}

{"description": "Hoo-ah! After seven Oscar nominations for his outstanding work in films such asThe Godfather,Serpico, andDog Day Afternoon, it's ironic that Al Pacino finally won the Oscar for his grandstanding lead performance in this 1992 crowd pleaser. As the blind, blunt, and ultimately benevolent retired Lieutenant Colonel Frank Slade, Pacino is both hammy and compelling, simultaneously subtle and grandly over-the-top when defending his new assistant and prep school student Charlie (Chris O'Donnell) at a disciplinary hearing. While the subplot involving Charlie's prep-school crisis plays like a sequel toDead Poets Society, Pacino's adventurous escapades in New York City provide comic relief, rich character development, and a memorable supporting role for Gabrielle Anwar as the young woman who accepts the colonel's invitation to dance the tango.Scent of a Womanis a remake of the 1972 Italian filmProfumo di donna.

Featuring the brief screen debut of Tony Curtis,Criss  Crossis a stylish masterpiece of clashing fates and fatal attractions;  Franz Planer's cinematography creates a shadow world in which every desire is  tainted by the threat of violence, and Miklos Rozsa's score underlines a love  story that could never end happily.

This isn't a classic golf comedy, like the Bill Murray vehicleCaddyshack, but as a hot-tempered would- be hockey player who finds an unexpected m&#xE9;tier as a power golfer, Sandler has a short-fuse shtick that's effectively deployed. He's like a punk rocker gleefully out of his element, puncturing the country-club atmosphere by using the fairway as a private mosh pit. The action gets repetitive beyond the midpoint, and a subplot involving Gilmore's lovable grandma and her problems with the IRS is dismayingly sappy. Sandler's iconoclasm is mostly window dressing; there's no conceptual or satirical daring in his kind of \"outrageousness.\" The strong supporting cast includes Christopher McDonald as Gilmore's smug rival on the links, Julie Bowen as a perky publicist, and, in a memorable bout of fisticuffs with our hero, game-show host Bob Barker.

(It's modeled after onWiseguyandGoodFellasand Pileggi's true crime bookCasino: Love and Honor in Las Vegas.)  Through Rothstein, the picture tells the story of how the Mafia seized, and finally lost control of, Las Vegas gambling.

Sharon Stone is the stand out among the actors; she nabbed an Oscar nomination for her role as the voracious Ginger, the glitzy call girl who becomes Rothstein's wife.

{"description": "Take off your thinking caps and toss 'em in a corner, 'cuz you won't  need 'em when you're watching this deliriously dumb thriller from 1997. Bruce Willis stars as a demoted FBI agent who comes to the aid of an autistic boy whose mind holds a potentially deadly secret. It seems that by gazing on a puzzle magazine and making order out of a hidden system of numbers, the 9-year-old autistic boy (Miko Hughes) has accidentally deciphered a sophisticated top-secret government code. This makes him the prime target of the ruthless bureaucrat (Alec Baldwin, in one of his silliest roles), and Willis comes to the rescue. This formulaic thriller sets up this plot with a lot of entertaining urgency, but you can't give any thought toMercury Risingor the whole movie collapses under the weight of its own illogic and nonsense. The redeeming values are the performances of Willis, young Hughes, and newcomer Kim Dickens as a woman who agrees (perhaps too easily, it seems) to aid Willis in his plot to outmaneuver the bad guys.Mercury Risingis not a waste of time compared to other formulaic thrillers, but its entertainment value depends on how much you enjoy being smarter than the movie.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6304259158", "6304844948", "B00008KDHM", "630300394X", "B000059XYK", "0783223218", "6304080921", "0800178394", "630470786X", "6301643410", "6305171750", "B00003CY0U", "6302482712", "B00007CVYA", "B00006BS6V", "0792147618"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 387495}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.9, "brand": "", "asin": "078322530X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/517K185XT6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Mercury Rising [VHS]"}

{"description": "Stanley Kubrick was only 31 years old when Kirk Douglas (star of Kubrick's classicPaths of Glory) recruited the young director to pilot this epic saga, in which the rebellious slave Spartacus (played by Douglas) leads a freedom revolt against the decadent Roman Empire. Kubrick would later disown the film because it was not a personal project--he was merely a director-for-hire--butSpartacusremains one of the best of Hollywood's grand historical epics. With an intelligent screenplay by then-blacklisted writer Dalton Trumbo (from a novel by Howard Fast), its message of moral integrity and courageous conviction is still quite powerful, and the all-star cast (including Charles Laughton in full toga) is full of entertaining surprises. Fully restored in 1991 to include scenes deleted from the original 1960 release, the full-lengthSpartacusis a grand-scale cinematic marvel, offering some of the most awesome battles ever filmed and a central performance by Douglas that's as sensitively emotional as it is intensely heroic. Jean Simmons plays the slave woman who becomes Spartacus's wife, and Peter Ustinov steals the show with his frequently hilarious, Oscar-winning performance as a slave trader who shamelessly curries favor with his Roman superiors. The restored version also includes a formerly deleted bathhouse scene in which Laurence Olivier plays a bisexual Roman senator (with restored dialogue dubbed by Anthony Hopkins) who gets hot and bothered over a slave servant played by Tony Curtis. These and other restored scenes expand the film to just over three hours in length. Despite some forgivable lulls, this is a rousing and substantial drama that grabs and holds your attention. Breaking tradition with sophisticated themes and a downbeat (yet eminently noble) conclusion,Spartacusis a thinking person's epic, rising above mere spectacle with a story as impressive as its widescreen action and Oscar-winning sets.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0074JOUHE", "B001DZOCY6", "B00005JN8Z", "B000062XF2", "B000056AXZ", "B001NSLE5I", "B00AMSM9CW", "B00125WAXM", "B00005V1WY", "B00ALTQRUC", "B000WMFZMY", "B00BQ7GU1Y", "0792841409", "B00AEBBACM", "B0006GANX2", "B0001NBMDK", "B00AEFY5B6", "B000BZISSU", "B000UJ48VI", "B000UJ48SQ", "B0002BO05S", "B000CNE0M4", "B00006ADD5", "B0010YSDAE", "B00004XPPC", "B002AT8KBU", "B008FYZI6E", "B0006GANN2", "B000055Y0X", "B004H0M31I", "B0006B2A6U", "0792838408", "B000056HEA", "B004L9GMBC", "B0007TKNGA", "B00005JKU0", "B005152C9G", "B005152C78", "B000EHSVS2", "B000095WW6", "B00AEFXD1O", "B007XTDXF0", "B000KX0IOA", "B000KJU18C", "B0050FXDDQ", "B003D3Y65G", "B00005PJ6T", "B003ZEQMH8", "0792833287", "B0000DI87S", "B0049985XW", "B0010YSD7W", "B00079Z9VO", "B0010AN7Z4", "B002VWNIAY", "B007K8ILTW", "B00AMSLDTM", "B007N31YH0", "B0001US8F8", "B0045HCJSA", "B002O3Z50Q", "B000CNESN0", "B000EHSVSC", "B00007G1WH", "B00AEFXKUI", "0767810864", "B00108FMFO", "B00407PNWO", "B0018O4RT2", "B000G8NXYG", "B000063US2", "B00005JKF6", "B0010YVCI4", "B00001ZWUS", "B000XJD34I", "B0045HCJ9E", "B000P0J09C", "B000C20VRS", "B000S0KYTE", "B007Y1NR1W", "B00007JMD8", "B00871C09S", "B000FZETR0", "B00008PC13", "B000HWZ4C0", "B001LPWGGY", "B003WKL6YO", "B00AEBB89C", "B00005N5S3", "B007FQXEVY", "B00DJYKGKS", "B0047BXQZY", "B0057FGCRI", "B0001NBMEE", "B000MGTQ7U", "B000059TFW", "B00003CXBU", "B002ZD3V10", "B00014K5V4", "B00005J75F"], "bought_together": ["B0074JOUHE", "B001NSLE5I"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00001ZWUS", "0792841409", "B00GGAK0FS", "B0016K40KY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 18109}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 13.27, "brand": "DOUGLAS,KIRK", "asin": "0783226039", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51FrSKZ6tSL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Spartacus"}

{"description": "Suffering from the extreme bad luck of being released at the same time as the low-budgetThe Blair Witch Project, this adaptation ofThe Haunting of Hill Houseattempts to update Shirley Jackson's psychologically terrifying ghost story to the era of big-budget, computerized special effects. Does it work? Well, let's just say that showing isn't exactly the same as telling. A prime example of bloated studio filmmaking,The Hauntingtelegraphs all its frights so blatantly that it forsakes any of Jackson's subtle horrors for the remedial scares of a clunky carnival ride. The story remains basically the same, with four people called to an old mansion for experiments in the supernatural, but instead of getting inside the heads of its main characters (as the 1963 adaptation by Robert Wise did so well), Jan DeBont's film deserts character development for the huge, glorious set design provided by Eugenio Zanetti (Restoration). Thus, instead of a well-drawn story you get... a well-drawn house, one that four very talented and underutilized actors--Lili Taylor, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Liam Neeson, and Owen Wilson--wander around in endlessly (as Zeta-Jones puts it, the house is \"sort of Charles Foster Kane meets the Munsters\"). Taylor, as the hypersensitive Nell, is the unknowing lynchpin in the battle between good and bad ghosts and gets saddled with most of the expository dialogue of the mansion's gothic backstory. Zeta-Jones (showing some spark) and Neeson (showing none) are sadly reduced to providing reactionary shots of the film's disastrous climax, which mixes hapless new-age affirmations with computer-generated effects of ghosts and exploding windows, walls, doors, etc. For this haunted-house story, take a quick tour of the breathtaking rooms, but definitelydon'tstay the night.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00003CWRF", "B00005UQ9W", "B0045HCJJE", "B000063US5", "B003VA3JUO", "B002AS45VK", "B00AEBBA2W", "B0000C2IQQ", "B00005LIRD", "B002GHHHL0", "B00AEBBA72", "B00K2CHY1Y", "078322799X", "B004SIP92O", "B000V4UFZK", "B00AEFYXQI", "B00BEIYMAG", "B000CCBC9O", "B001BSBBGC", "B00E32PJ02", "B0000AOX0D", "B000UUX2Z0", "B000HC2LFI", "B0021L8UFI", "B00009PY4G", "0767824954", "B0010X73ZG", "B00AEBB91E", "0800177029", "B00AEFYYH6", "B0008191WO", "B00000IQVQ", "B00008LUNW", "B00003CXKM", "6305718954", "B00005JNY3", "B0002DB54A", "B004LWZW24", "B002VWNIDG", "B00DBNLBAQ", "0783116926", "B000GBEWRU", "0783225482", "B00AIBZLVY", "B004AC6PV2", "B0001FR3IQ", "B000GCFO0I", "B000NOIVT0", "B001B1872U", "B004P7CNUY", "B00004BZIY", "B00005JNBN", "B0009X763M", "B000NQRR1Q", "B00006FDCD", "B000AM6OQ2", "B00005O5B5", "0792839684", "B0000694XX", "B00000JQB5", "0780622650", "6305017115", "B003498SCQ", "1573625779", "B001B8XRT6", "B00000IQC4", "B00AEFXPMG", "6305300801", "B00EZ50SGW", "B00006AUIG", "B000TJ6PBK", "B0006SGYL0", "B004SIP9MY", "B001P3SA9Y", "B00023P4TM", "6305090564", "B000AM4P9K", "B00JPS7HOA", "B00B96TGQS", "B003UGLCIA", "B005LAIGOQ", "B004SIP9O2", "B00DZP1C9K", "B000ARXF96", "B004LWZW2O", "6305767866", "B002945DUW", "B000RIWAVW", "B000FFJYBG", "B00005JOWW", "B005TK23PQ", "B004XVMCN0", "B009XTF8KQ", "B001CFEC2Y", "B00006IUFV", "B00317LM8S", "B0021L8UPS", "B008874968", "6305428042", "B008JFUS0U"], "bought_together": ["B000063US5"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00BTYXNRI", "B0045HCJJE", "B000ASATYO", "0783116926"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 18281}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.84, "brand": "Dreamworks Skg", "asin": "0783237413", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51aYQx70GGL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Haunting"}

{"description": "Ever since the late '70s when the Australian New Wave was in full surge, Down  Under directors have delivered movies that often hit you like news from another planet. Offbeat characters, weird narrative twists, and a tart  mixture of laughs and catastrophe--this is the juice that fuels such flicks asProof,The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert,Strictly Ballroom,Heavenly Creatures, and most certainlyMuriel's Wedding. Directed by P.J.  Hogan (who would go on to helm the Hollywood hitMy Best Friend's Wedding),  this little gem follows tradition by featuring an authentic misfit: Muriel  (Toni Collette), a great overweight horse of a girl obsessed with getting  married and the music of ABBA. Appropriately, we first meet Muriel at a  wedding, all trussed up in a leopardskin number she's boosted for the  occasion. When her snotty peers insist that she give up the bridal bouquet to  someone who might actually get hitched, when one of the guests turns out to be a clerk in the very store where Muriel ripped off her outfit--you gotta  laugh, she's such an unmitigated mess. A loser, her philandering politician father (Bill Hunter) calls her--along with his doormat wife and his other  couch-potato offspring. But this movie's no exercise in geek-bashing. As  Muriel takes up with feisty Rhonda (Rachel Griffiths) and moves from Porpoise  Spit to the big city, her good-hearted grin and zest for life draw us in  despite hilarious gaffes and mishaps. (Making out with a boy for the first  time, Muriel suddenly finds herself awash in styrofoam: the oaf has unzipped  the beanbag chair instead of her skin-tight leather pants.)Muriel's Weddingcovers territory Hollywood would banish from a comedy--Rhonda's cancer, the  suicide of Muriel's mother, a marriage of convenience to an arrogant  athlete--yet, like its heroine, it never loses its sense of humor, its will to move on to whatever good thing might happen next. Everyone in the  idiosyncratic cast is terrific, but it's Toni Collette's Dancing Queen who  makesMuriel's Weddinga cinematic celebration you won't forget.--Kathleen  Murphy", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004SIPAJG", "B00001U0DW", "B001CDR1F6", "0792843983", "B0000714BP", "B004VJJGFG", "B00BXL249K", "B00005JN1K", "B000089794", "B00006FMUW", "6305428425", "B000CCBCAS", "B00005JNC5", "B00003CXPD", "0792833198", "B0001HAGRE", "B000CCW2P2", "B00EPH8SBM", "B0045HCJGW", "B008NNY8TK", "B00BTYJYR6", "B001GKJ2DY", "0767827740", "B00A33J8YS", "B00CMQIDKY", "B00005JLD4", "B00DW5IJR6", "B003EYVXQ4", "B007UW9W5U", "B000002GLW", "B000ETRCN0", "B00005ALS0", "B00BAYLS1K", "B0001L3LUO", "B00AEFYNG8", "B00006AW0I", "6305283516", "B004XVMCQ2", "6305882592", "B000001DZO", "B000EHRVOW", "B001PPGAIA", "B004U7MR4G", "B0016MJ6T2", "B000087F7Q", "B000023VTP", "B00001W9G0", "B000AYYVME", "B0000542C7", "B00005N5SA", "B008LFYZAM", "B001DB6J6Y", "B00KNALRZ4", "B00FZ4KR4U", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B00003CY5G", "B00005K3NU", "B0011FDVD6", "B00006ZXSL", "B00004TWZH", "B004D45NYC", "B00005JL7Q", "B000FO0AA6", "B000J103OI", "B005EVJCOA", "B00004VVMZ", "B00DL46ZN8", "B0045HCJRG", "0783225482", "B000068V9U", "B0001WPQJ2", "B00005JKGK", "B000063ING", "B007UW9W32", "B000092T3P", "B000765IJK", "B000069HZP", "B00AEFY4TO", "B000035Z5H", "B00005JNDZ", "0857687247", "B000NA1WDQ", "B004SIP9VA", "B000ELJAEM", "B0007IO6NM", "6304696558", "B004XVMCMG", "B0021L8UOY", "B00AEFY4CG", "B002GHHHJC", "B0053TWVQ4", "B001C47ZOW", "B0043X1FOU", "B009B1EPQ4", "B0000A02Y4", "B00008R9KD", "B0064MT1FI", "B0001I55M4", "6305622914", "B00CPIXOEY"], "bought_together": ["B004SIPAJG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0792843983", "B0000714BP", "0792833198", "B00EPH8SBM"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 57288}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.99, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "0788814958", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/7176GF4V61L._SY300_.gif", "title": "Muriel's Wedding"}
{"description": "Another made-for-video sequel to a Disney masterpiece. As with theBeauty and the BeastandPocahontassequels, most of the recognizable vocal talents return, creating a worthwhile successor to the highest-grossing animated film ever. We pick up the story as the lion king, Simba (voiced by Matthew Broderick), and Nala (Moira Kelly) have a new baby cub, a girl named Kiara (Neve Campbell). Like her father before, she seeks adventure and ends up outside the Pridelands, where lions loyal to the evil Scar (who died in the original) have lived with revenge in their hearts. The leader, Zira (a spunky turn from Suzanne Pleshette), schemes to use her son Kovu (Jason Marsden) to destroy Simba. As luck with have it, Kiara has bumped into Kovu and fallen in love.This all sounds familiar since all of Disney's straight-to-video sequels have played it very safe, nearly repeating the originals' story, tone, and pace. Perhaps there were too many cooks for this production. Besides the two screenplay credits, there are eight other writers credited for additional written material. The look of the film has none of the surprise of the original but is far superior to other animated videos. In fact, the film played in European theaters.For kids, the sequel will be a favorite. The comic antics of Timon (Nathan Lane) and Pumba (Ernie Sabella) are enjoyable, as is Andy Dick as Nuka, the mixed-up older son of Zira. And there's plenty of action. The best element is the music.

Classical music-loving proto-punk Alex (Malcolm McDowell) and his \"Droogs\" spend their nights getting high at the Korova Milkbar before embarking on \"a little of the old ultraviolence,\" such as terrorizing a writer, Mr. Alexander (Patrick Magee), and gang raping his wife (who later dies as a result). After Alex is jailed for bludgeoning the Cat Lady (Miriam Karlin) to death with one of her phallic sculptures, Alex submits to the Ludovico behavior modification technique to earn his freedom; he's conditioned to abhor violence through watching gory movies, and even his adored Beethoven is turned against him. Returned to the world defenseless, Alex becomes the victim of his prior victims, with Mr. Alexander using Beethoven's Ninth to inflict the greatest pain of all. When society sees what the state has done to Alex, however, the politically expedient move is made.", "related": {"also_bought": ["0790734079", "0790705141", "B00004U8PA", "B00000FZCU", "6303953425", "6304484054", "0783235607", "6304039220", "630268644X", "B00006G8O1", "0790700506", "B0002G2B2W", "6305576173", "B000059HCI", "B00008X5J1", "0792837797", "B00000J2KZ", "6300267881", "6301977742", "6300216713", "6300269132", "B00000I1DI", "6302783356", "6300214826", "6305095566", "B00005JLET", "6302054982", "0800103106", "6302201845", "6302798450", "B00000J2L7", "6304994540", "6303686796", "B00005PJ8I", "6300216500", "0783228317", "6303107338", "6304935811", "B00004W5UA", "6302610702", "0783246641", "6300183211", "6302921058", "0792842111", "B00004T37H", "B00002E285", "B00003CXE6", "B000007OY0", "6301971582", "6300184064", "B00005LL26", "0790736039"], "bought_together": ["0790734079", "0790705141"], "also_viewed": ["0393312836", "0790705141", "B0013FSXT6", "B00GGAK0FS", "B008RO875Q", "B004O724M2", "B00004TLMC", "B00023NRSM", "B008M4MB8K", "6305440093", "6303953425", "6303939015", "6303148387", "6303861733", "B00003CXB4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 296220}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.95, "brand": "", "asin": "0790701022", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51EV1DQCCGL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "A Clockwork Orange"}
{"description": "When Prince's dazzling and dynamicPurple Rain(movie and soundtrack album) and the hypnotic hit single &quot;When Doves Cry&quot; exploded onto the pop-culture scene in 1984, it seemed there was nothing the purple one couldn't do. The film is basically a feature-length music video, but no musician has ever had a better big-screen showcase for his many talents.  The plot is really just a theme (about the son of an abusive father struggling not to continue the pattern) upon which to hang some of Prince's most dazzling songs (including &quot;Let's Go Crazy&quot; and the title tune), and some sizzling live-concert numbers.  Apollonia Kotero is ravishing as the romantic interest, and Morris Day and the Time provide some terrific musical competition.Purple Rainis an essential artifact of the mid-'80s pop Zeitgeist.

Their competitive natures kick into overdrive when the beautiful Ariel (Ann-Margret) moves into their otherwise snowbound Minnesota neighborhood. She takes a liking to John, but after a lover's spat she also gives Max a chance at romance, and the long-time buddies reach a peak of grumpy rivalry. It's a stretch to think that Ann-Margret's dating choices would be limited to a pair of grouchy codgers, but sarcastic attitude and snappy dialogue made this a surprise hit (followed by a 1995 sequel), and Burgess Meredith adds plenty of spice as Lemmon's amorous old father.

{"description": "Mel Brooks scored his first commercial hit with this raucous Western spoof starring the late Cleavon Little as the newly hired (and conspicuously black) sheriff of Rock Ridge. Sheriff Bart teams up with deputy Jim (Gene Wilder) to foil the railroad-building scheme of the nefarious Hedley Lamarr (Harvey Korman). The simple plot is just an excuse for a steady stream of gags, many of them unabashedly tasteless, that Brooks and his wacky cast pull off with side-splitting success. The humor is so juvenile and crude that you just have to surrender to it; highlights abound, from the lunkheaded Alex Karras as the ox-riding Mongo to Madeline Kahn's uproarious send-up of Marlene Dietrich as saloon songstress Lili Von Shtupp. Adding to the comedic excess is the infamous campfire scene involving a bunch of hungry cowboys, heaping servings of baked beans and, well, you get the idea.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000G6BLRE", "B000G6BLWE", "B003CRM6PA", "B00AEFXDO6", "B000G6BLW4", "0792844890", "B0000A02TZ", "B00005O3VC", "B000G6BLQU", "B0009UC810", "B0009IOR5M", "B006TTC5GS", "B000M7XR9W", "B00AEFYVMO", "B00287Z18Y", "B000BMY2LU", "B00158K0QU", "B0008JIJ2O", "B000Z8GZYW", "B00AMSQBRQ", "B00441GZ2S", "B00003CXC3", "B000BYA4J2", "B000K405CY", "B00005UEQX", "B00D3LA6AW", "B000A7DVR2", "B000VE439Y", "B00AEBB99Q", "B0001ZX0O2", "B00407PO3W", "B004P9UWM8", "B00004RJ73", "B000A2UBNE", "B00AEFYPAC", "B00005V0XF", "B000G6BLYC", "B00AEFYJI0", "B000P0J0EW", "B002N57KG2", "B0000A14TA", "B007STBUHI", "B00008K76U", "B0019HQICW", "B00005JKCB", "B00BTYRB1C", "B0014Z4OMU", "6305609764", "B007P9HW3M", "B000LBL3TK", "B000E6ESJ4", "B000BKJ762", "B00AMSQBUI", "B00AEFXXMI", "0783227388", "B00005U5A8", "B000P0J09M", "B00079Z9VO", "0792833279", "B00AJCUL1C", "B000089765", "0790742012", "B003ASLJS6", "B004SIP6LS", "B003ELKNH2", "B000EQHXOG", "B000A2UBN4", "B0018Q1F72", "B00004TJQK", "B00AEBB9DM", "6305212112", "B004EPZ084", "B00AEFY3MC", "B0000CBY1C", "B002VWNIAY", "B004FQX5B6", "0783235070", "B000HEZESM", "B000W1SZBS", "0790729342", "B0045HCJKS", "0783227884", "B002VWNIEA", "B00441GZ14", "B000F6ZIII", "B0007ZEOCS", "6304711905", "B006TTC50Y", "B0038Z5SOM", "B003AWRMCE", "B004L9GMBC", "B00BMJ7ZKG", "B005F96UJ6", "B004SIP95G", "B00AEFZ8OY", "B008QE9XD2", "B00005PJ6O", "B0019L21GA", "B001AEF6C2", "B002ZG96ZC"], "bought_together": ["B000G6BLWE", "B00AEFXDO6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000E6ESIK", "B003CRM6PA", "B007NQLA9O", "0792844890"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 48893}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.98, "brand": "", "asin": "0790731487", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51V99G30KSL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Blazing Saddles"}

This time, there's no traveling involved: Clark and Ellen (Beverly D'Angelo) prepare for a nice Christmas with the kids (played by none other than Juliette Lewis andRoseannestar Johnny Galecki), when their home is invaded by backwoods cousin Eddie (Randy Quaid) and his brood, along with assorted other crazy and/or stuffy relatives. Complications, of course, are inevitable. The film is preceded byNational Lampoon's Vacation(1983) andNational Lampoon's European Vacation(1985) and followed byNational Lampoon's Vegas Vacation(1997).

{"description": "AlthoughMad Max Beyond Thunderdome, the third part of George Miller's post-apocalypticMad Maxtrilogy, is certainly the least of the bunch (Mad Max 2: The Road Warrioris the undisputed masterpiece, and maybe the best action movie ever made), it has still got a good share of imaginative industrial-wasteland-pastiche imagery. And casting Tina Turner as Aunty Entity, the queen of Bartertown, was a masterstroke. Mel Gibson's character Max is pitted in a battle to the death against the bizarre Master Blaster in the Thunderdome, flying around on rubbery straps inside a sort of gigantic overturned colander with bloodthirsty spectators clinging to the outside. Miller's producing partner, Byron Kennedy, was killed in a helicopter crash while scouting locations for this film. Miller was devastated, only agreeing to direct the action sequences--and, somehow, you feel his heart wasn't entirely in it.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["0790729342", "B00005R2IS", "B00004Y87O", "B00AEFYDM2", "B0068FZ0O2", "B00BLSAM3A", "B000U1ZV8K", "B00IZZDWKM", "B0000VD12I", "B003XURDAY", "B00005N5S5", "B000QUCQX8", "B003ZD9DUC", "B001VLBDD0", "B00005JA8B", "B0001Z37HM", "B000RW3VCK", "B0000AOX0F", "B00000IXPN", "0783241895", "B0019BI1DM", "B0045HCJIK", "B002OGMGV4", "6304806434", "B0045HCJ5S", "B00HZMZ2FE", "B000NA1WGS", "0783227396", "B002GHHHNI", "B00005N7Z1", "B00013RC8E", "B00004STDN", "B002AS464Q", "B000QQJ3Q0", "B0002CHK1S", "B00I6JODGO", "B000U1ZV6C", "B00070FX5U", "B008CYDD7I", "B00BTYJYR6", "B0000844I8", "0783227434", "B000E6ESEO", "B000QXDCLU", "B0001611DI", "B00AKGG828", "B00000IQC4", "B00008G8LY", "B000V4UFZK", "B000MDFTHE", "0792839684", "B000056PMU", "B00BTYOYG2", "B001JFZ118", "0800195175", "B001TK80C0", "1558908846", "B00005AVS9", "B003ELKNH2", "B0000VCZK2", "B001AS32QK", "B00000IREA", "B0045HCJT4", "B0045HCJ9O", "6304936532", "B000MGBSE4", "B000MRA542", "B000056WR3", "B00003CXC5", "B0013LL2Z2", "B0002O7XW2", "0792838300", "B000FO0AA6", "B0000959N0", "B009WGYXIS", "B0045HCJGC", "B00B83ROIE", "B002GHHHOM", "B0015XHQT4", "B001AEF6C2", "B0043X1FLS", "B000EGDB10", "B000P0J0BU", "078321958X", "B002GHHHP6", "B00003CXQG", "B0043X1FNQ", "B0006J28MS", "B000286RNE", "B0013D8LA4", "0767802497", "B00009OWI1", "B0015XHQUI", "B000WC3864", "B0038SUBEG", "B000056PNL", "B00BJC8RPI", "0783226934", "B0007V6ITE", "B00005JKCB"], "bought_together": ["B00005R2IS", "0790729342"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00BLRXDTQ", "0790729342", "B00005R2IS", "B000NA1WGS"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 41661}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 13.9, "brand": "Mad", "asin": "0790731932", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RIO-CFrYL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome"}

Pop star and bodyguard don't hit it off at first, but they wear down each others' defenses, and before long Houston is baring her tonsils with a rousing rendition of the Dolly Parton chestnut &quot;I Will Always Love You.&quot; The film, written by Lawrence Kasden, was originally intended for Steve McQueen, but the script languished for years before Houston took an interest in the project.

{"description": "Director Oliver Stone added 17 minutes of previously unseen footage for the &quot;director's cut&quot; edition of his hypnotic courtroom epic about the investigation into the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in November 1963. That fateful day in Dallas set in motion a sequence of events that would only intensify the mystery behind Kennedy's death, causing New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner) to begin an investigation that would gradually become a personal obsession. Bravura filmmaking combined with controversial treatment of historical facts and audacious speculation, this breathtaking revision of history presents a mesmerizing parade of shady figures and conspiracy theories, unfolding like a classic mystery based on history's greatest unsolved crime. A technical triumph boasting Oscar-winning cinematography and editing, Stone's film is guaranteed to grab the viewer's attention with its daring take on the JFK controversy.

{"description": "This 1941 melodrama is memorable for both its strong central performances and their intimations of how the previous decade's crime dramas would evolve into film noir--no accident, given the solid direction of veteran Raoul Walsh and the hand of screenwriter John Huston, who teamed with the author of its novelistic source, W.R. Burnett (Little Caesar). In the central character of Roy \"Mad Dog\" Earle, a fictional peer to John Dillinger, Humphrey Bogart finds a defining role that anticipates the underlying fatalism and moral ambiguity visible in the career-making roles soon to follow, including Sam Spade in Huston's directorial debut,The Maltese Falcon.Earle suggests a prescient variation on the enraged sociopaths that were fixtures of the gangster melodramas that shaped Bogart's early screen image. Pardoned from a long prison stretch, the weary robber is clearly more eager to savor his new freedom than immediately swing back into action. But his early release has been engineered by a mobster who wants Earle to pull off a high-stakes burglary, setting in motion a plot that is a prototype for doomed-heist capers--a small, yet potent subgenre that would later include Huston'sThe Asphalt Jungleand Stanley Kubrick'sThe Killing.What givesHigh Sierraits power, however, isn't the crime itself but Earle's collision with the younger, brasher confederates picked to help him, and the hard-edged but vulnerable taxi dancer they're competing for, played forcefully by Ida Lupino, who actually received top billing. Her attraction to the reluctant Earle is complicated by a convoluted subplot designed to showcase then starlet Joan Leslie, but the movie finally moves into its most gripping moments when the wounded Earle, pursued by police, flees ever higher toward the mountains. His final, suicidal showdown would become a clich&eacute; of sorts in lesser films, but here it provides a wrenching climax sealed by Lupino's vivid final scene.--Sam Sutherland", "related": {"also_bought": ["0790743159", "6304429274", "6301976983", "B0000068EE", "B000BWIZRW", "B000BWIZTU", "6302875064", "0792839153", "0783217528", "6301978110", "6303391931", "079074886X", "6301975987", "B002VWNIAY", "6304212151", "6303430910", "6300213900", "6301327845", "0790746387", "6302801133", "630442972X", "6303402070", "6300216500", "6301973291", "6301491920", "6302952581", "6300213838", "6302360978", "0792835077", "6301964012", "6300163431", "6301967909", "6301971426", "0782008348", "6300181537", "0790733897", "6300185168", "6302032245"], "bought_together": ["6304429274", "0790743159"], "also_viewed": ["0790743159", "B0000068EE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 439485}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.95, "brand": "", "asin": "0790747154", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516TJZC5XFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "High Sierra [VHS]"}

The story is familiar, but it has been handled with such vitality and emotional honesty that you can't help but leap and cheer for Rocky Balboa, the chump turned champ (despite his valiant defeat in the ring) who stuns the boxing world with the support of his timid girlfriend, Adrian (Talia Shire), and grizzled trainer, Gus (Burgess Meredith).

{"description": "Based on Thomas Harris's novel, this terrifying film by Jonathan Demme really only contains a couple of genuinely shocking moments (one involving an autopsy, the other a prison break). The rest of the film is a splatter-free visual and psychological descent into the hell of madness, redeemed astonishingly by an unlikely connection between a monster and a haunted young woman. Anthony Hopkins is extraordinary as the cannibalistic psychiatrist Dr. Hannibal Lecter, virtually entombed in a subterranean prison for the criminally insane. At the behest of the FBI, agent-in-training Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) approaches Lecter, requesting his insights into the identity and methods of a serial killer named Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine). In exchange, Lecter demands the right to penetrate Starling's most painful memories, creating a bizarre but palpable intimacy that liberates them both under separate but equally horrific circumstances. Demme, a filmmaker with a uniquely populist vision (Melvin and Howard,Something Wild), also spent his early years making pulp for Roger Corman (Caged Heat), and he hasn't forgotten the significance of tone, atmosphere, and the unsettling nature of a crudely effective close-up. Much of the film, in fact, consists of actors staring straight into the camera (usually from Clarice's point of view), making every bridge between one set of eyes to another seem terribly dangerous.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005LKIM", "6302054982", "B00008AOS5", "B00005PJ8I", "B000007OY0", "6302800420", "0790705141", "B00003CXE6", "6301179552", "6301427076", "B000003KHS", "6300989003", "6303402348", "B0000633ZP", "B00005ATQA"], "bought_together": ["6302054982"], "also_viewed": ["6305363668", "6302415853", "0792116887", "079213690X", "0800103106", "6305750750"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 331980}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.0, "brand": "", "asin": "0792842111", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4117Q86BS0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Silence of the Lambs [VHS]"}

{"description": "Rain Manis the kind of touching drama that Oscars are made for--and, sure enough, the film took Academy honors for best picture, director, screenplay, and actor (Dustin Hoffman) in 1988. Hoffman plays Raymond, an autistic savant whose late father has left him $3 million in a trust. This gets the attention of his materialistic younger brother, a hot-shot LA car dealer named Charlie (Tom Cruise) who wasn't even aware of Raymond's existence until he read his estranged father's will. Charlie picks up Raymond and takes him on a cross-country journey that becomes a voyage of discovery for Charlie, and, perhaps, for Raymond, too.Rain Manwill either captivate you or irritate you (Raymond's sputtering of repetitious phrases is enough to drive anyone crazy), but it is obviously a labor of love for those involved. Hoffman had been attached to the film for many years, as various directors and writers came and went, but his persistence eventually paid off--kind of like Raymond in Las Vegas. Look for director Barry Levinson in a cameo as a psychiatrist near the end of the film.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000FVQLQQ", "B00AEFY0F2", "B004SIP7ZS", "B000066HAS", "0800141741", "B004FQX5B6", "B0043X1FL8", "0767811100", "B0018QPPXW", "B000P0J0EW", "B000065V3G", "B00AEFXYJA", "B000ZM1MG4", "B0002WZTOI", "B001680M26", "B00005B6JZ", "B002VWNIBI", "0800141806", "B000P0J0EM", "B00079Z9VO", "B00AEFYSWM", "B00AEFY4CG", "B007SPPANM", "B00005MEOU", "0792833287", "B00081U7HC", "6305144168", "B006TTC5HC", "B00AEFXR1K", "B0000DIXDR", "B00AEBB9LO", "B004U7MR1Y", "B00AEFYRP0", "B00AEBB9F0", "B00AEBB9FA", "B000QQLVPQ", "B00003CWQR", "B00006RCO1", "B000LP6KNU", "0783226810", "B004AOECXI", "B00AEFZ63M", "B000PHVZNE", "B007N31YH0", "B000GAKDAG", "B0000JBALO", "B002NZK5UU", "B00000IQV7", "B00011CZRE", "B000CNESTE", "B000035Z5G", "B00004WG2F", "B00008EY60", "B000ZM1MGE", "0780619587", "0784011710", "B00AEBB99Q", "B000G6BLHY", "079284646X", "B00008K76U", "0767836359", "B00AEFXXMI", "B0068FZ0GK", "B00026ZG10", "B00AEFXKUI", "0767803434", "B00005M2CO", "6305236569", "0783225733", "B00AEBB9UK", "0792833198", "B001AEF6BI", "B000HEWEJO", "B002M2Z3BA", "B001KRCDSO", "B00006RCO3", "B00AEFXESQ", "B00B0U2SFE", "B00AEBB9SM", "B000067IZ3", "B0006GANOQ", "6304712936", "B00001ZWUS", "B000VECAD0", "B000KX0IOA", "6304907729", "B000055Y0Y", "B0002B15ZG", "6304711891", "6305213305", "630471193X", "B00AEFYXJ0", "B00007BKVC", "B00AEBB95K", "B00003CWRX", "B0008ENHUI", "B000765IJK", "B00004TVUD", "B004FQX5A2", "B00005ATZT"], "bought_together": ["B00AEFY0F2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004SIP7ZS", "B00AEFY0F2", "B0094V8OXG", "0783226845"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 40583}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.99, "brand": "", "asin": "0792833260", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514MRDGQE7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Rain Man"}

{"description": "Timelessly entertaining and worthy of cult status,Strange  Invadersis beloved among sci-fi enthusiasts as an early-'80s tribute to its  1950s counterparts. It's got a touch of satire that Joe Dante fans will  appreciate, but director Michael Laughlin seems more intent on honoring  alien-invasion classics likeThe ThingandInvasion of the Body  Snatcherswhile offering a low-budget alternative toClose Encounters of  the Third Kind. There's even a quick Steven Spielberg sight gag as an  affectionate sign of the times, and the film's deliberately cheap-looking style  blends well with eerie special effects and gooey alien makeup. The plot is  simple--Paul LeMat investigates the disappearance of his ex-wife (Diana Scarwid)  in a small Illinois town that's been occupied by aliens for 25 years--but the  movie's creepy atmosphere and well-chosen cast (including Nancy Allen, Louise  Fletcher, andThe Thing's Kenneth Tobey) make it a fine companion to the  films that inspired it.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_viewed": ["0792846702"]}, "price": 29.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 342548}, "asin": "0792846753", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/511JQ8BHF6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Strange Invaders [VHS]"}

{"description": "Horror master John Carpenter offers up a triple treat withThe  Fog: Jamie Lee Curtis, Adrienne Barbeau, and Janet Leigh all in the same  movie. As if that weren't enough, both John Houseman and Hal Holbrook make  appearances, each clearly enjoying the novelty of being in a horror flick.The Fogopens just before the centennial celebration of the seaside  town of Antonio Bay. Then the witching hour strikes, glowing fog rolls in,  and all hell breaks loose. Carpenter wrote the script with producer Debra  Hill, his collaborator onHalloween, and the two know their craft.  It's a creepy story and a tight script, and, as in their previous effort, the  audience gets to know the main characters a bit before they're put in danger.  The movie also has a sly sense of humor: \"Things seem to happen to me,\" says  slasher vet Jamie Lee. \"I'm bad luck.\" Barbeau is also obviously having a  great time, sinking her teeth into her role as a frightened disc jockey  watching the fog roll in from a lighthouse.The Fogoffers a few  shocks and plenty of good old-fashioned clammy chills.

Gandhi, who introduced the doctrine of nonviolent resistance to the colonized people of India and who ultimately gained the nation its independence. Kingsley is magnificent as Gandhi as he changes over the course of the three-hour film from an insignificant lawyer to an international leader and symbol.

{"description": "Screenwriter Bruce Joel Rubin (author of the fancifulGhost) made his directorial debut with this more serious confrontation with the realities of death. Michael Keaton plays an advertising executive who learns he is dying even as his wife (Nicole Kidman) is pregnant.

Ngor (The Killing Fields) is terrific as a doctor who helps Keaton's character to recognize the corrosiveness of his rage and to let go.

{"description": "A box-office hit when released in 1994, this sprawling, frequently overwrought familial melodrama may get sillier as its plot progresses, but it's the kind of lusty, character-based epic that Hollywood should attempt more often. It's also an unabashedly flattering star vehicle for Brad Pitt as Tristan--the rebellious middle son of a fiercely independent Montana rancher and military veteran (Anthony Hopkins)--who is routinely at odds with his more responsible older brother, Alfred (Aidan Quinn), and younger brother, Samuel (Henry Thomas). From the battlefields of World War I to his adventures as an oceangoing sailor, Tristan's life is full of personal torment, especially when he returns to Montana and finds himself competing with Alfred over Samuel's beautiful widow (Julia Ormond), whose passion for Tristan disrupts the already turbulent Ludlow clan. Under the wide-open canopy of Big Sky country, this operatic tale unfolds with all the bloodlust, tragedy, and scenery-chewing performances you'd expect to find in a hokey bestselling novel (in fact, it's based on the acclaimed novella by Jim Harrison), but it's a potent mix that's highly entertaining. Not surprisingly, John Toll won an Academy Award for his breathtaking outdoor cinematography.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0800121600", "0783230893", "6302415853", "B0000214F3", "B00329TVQA", "6301963911", "6304119046", "0790734079", "6300185095", "6300182304", "6304258984", "6304147139", "1558807381", "6301586026"], "bought_together": ["0800121600"], "also_viewed": ["6302130379", "0767836359"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 342881}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.74, "brand": "", "asin": "0800135954", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HTKHKV7SL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Legends of the Fall [VHS]"}

{"description": "An ultracreepy blend of horror and fantasy (think of it asBeauty and the Bugs) from Mexican director Guillermo del Toro (Cronos) about giant cockroaches in the subway tunnels beneath Manhattan. Like its DNA-altered spawn (the title refers to the way some insects evolve to resemble their predators),Mimicis not your everyday bug picture, but a more poetic (though quite gruesome) sort of film, literally crawling with bizarre, striking images. In this case, the mutant bugs are not the result of evil atomic experiments (as inThem!), but are the unexpected side effect of work done by an entomologist (Mira Sorvino) and her Center for Disease Control officer husband (Jeremy Northam), who, in a last-ditch effort to control a roach-carried disease epidemic that was killing children, released a genetically altered form of sterile cockroaches beneath the city. They stopped the virus, but... Also starring Charles Dutton, Giancarlo Giannini, F. Murray Abraham, and Josh Brolin.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEFYXQI", "B00005BCKJ", "B0043VUHV4", "6305090564", "B0000ARD7S", "B000274TLW", "B00004YA67", "B0001GH6ZK", "B00006HAXZ", "B000E5KUME", "B00000JNBX", "B00000IQVQ", "B00020VZTS", "B002QW7ALM", "B00003CY1G", "B001BEJ4J2", "B0020H45B6", "B0007GP7I2", "B004G8WS66", "B000A2X49M", "B00005JRMX", "B00AEFXW8I", "B0013D8LMC", "B0041LULM6", "B00D3LA63Y", "B0029EW7BA", "B00GNZM0D6", "B00E0FVZAK", "B002GHHHL0", "B009P25UWW", "B00000JGDA", "B00005JKWJ", "B00005O5B5", "B00000IQC4", "B000QFCDCW", "B00153ZR8G", "0784014213", "B004P7CN7W", "B000BUNZY2", "B001AK3S4Y", "B0000DD75T", "B000O76ZQC", "B009XTF8KQ", "B004BZ5AN2", "B002NZK5U0", "B0015ET3YO", "B000BBOUW2", "B004P7CMHI", "B008CYDD7I", "B002UNMW7O", "B001F7MSFM", "B00009OWI1", "B005TK23PQ", "B00111YM5Q", "B000QQJ3Q0", "B001JNNDJM", "B00003CXKA", "B002GIBVVG", "B0002CHK1S", "B00005N5RM", "B00000IQVX", "B000096I9P", "B0067QPVJ6", "0783226934", "B008JFUNYG", "B003VA3JUO", "B00EZ50SGW", "B00AEBB91E", "0767817478", "B00HW3EJ6Y", "0800177789", "B00003CY6P", "B000A2X3U2", "0792839684", "B008JFUQZ2", "0783240953", "B001VLBDD0", "6305922675", "B00006JDVV", "6305258287", "B002ZG97CO", "B0018O4YT0", "6305767866", "B00DZP1C2W", "B00IJS2OXG", "B0021L8UXA", "B001MFNB4O", "B000056PMU", "B004LWZVZC", "B0024FAG44", "B00AEFY2WI", "B000U7169M", "B0000541W8", "0783230427", "B00CDV4PPK", "B00005JPUN", "1578482917", "B0002DB54A", "B00007AJG4"], "bought_together": ["B00AEFYXQI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0077PTWLO", "B000O76ZQC", "B0043VUHV4", "B00CEIOH50"]}, "price": 6.23, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 149893}, "asin": "1558908323", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Y3KPY438L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Mimic"}

This amiable black comedy, cowritten by Cusack and directed by Jonathan Demme prot&eacute;g&eacute; George Armitage (Miami Blues), has the feel of Demme'sSomething WildandMarried to the Mob--which is to say its humor is dark and brightly colored at the same time.

{"description": "An ultra-cheap B-horror movie, filmed in Lawrence, Kansas, in 1962, with a  really creepyTwilight Zone-style premise and some great shoestring atmosphere.  Wandering into a small town after an auto accident, to begin her new job as a church  organist, young Mary Henry (Candace Hilligoss) begins to pick up strange vibes: none of  the normal people in town seem to be able to see her, and she keeps being accosted by  freakish pasty-faced types who seem to be dead on their feet. The nightmarish finale  benefits from its one-of-a-kind \"found\" setting, an empty amusement park rising like a  ghostly castle from the prairie landscape.

{"description": "Set during the Chinese takeover of Hong Kong in 1997, this fascinating film uses that urgent and grandly ceremonial political backdrop for an intimate study of personal transition. Jeremy Irons plays a seasoned journalist who discovers he is terminally ill, causing him to be torn between his obsessive love for a former prostitute (Chinese film star Li Gong) and a streetwise hustler (Maggie Cheung) whom he has chosen as the subject of a video documentary. Through his involvement in the lives of these two very different women, director Wayne Wang (The Joy Luck Club) creates a cinematic \"love-hate letter\" to his native Hong Kong, where each character is allegorical and suffers an identity crisis much like Hong Kong itself. The film's love story is somewhat aimless and ultimately unimportant, butChinese Box(even the title suggests a place that holds secrets within its borders) remains a fascinating film in the semi-documentary tradition, capturing the psychology of its time and place with compelling immediacy.

Mobster Ice-T calls dozens of associates to a newly built prison the day before it's dedicated, locks them in, and pits them against one another for a prize of $10 million, which the last three survivors will split. Bleached blond Christopher Lambert is a grinning psycho having a little too much fun, while the soul of the group belongs to the craggy-faced Michael Halsey, a ruthless killer with an odd sense of purpose and a code of honor. The story is merely an excuse for unending gunplay and giddy violence and Pyun rises to the occasion, executing everything from riotous free-for-alls to elaborate chases to Western-style standoffs (complete with a haunting spaghetti Western style guitar and trumpet theme). The video titles, dingy lighting, and dusky color give away the low budget and ultimately the script doesn't make any sense, but Pyun wisely avoids the confusing plot (which he himself sometimes loses) and concentrates on his particular strength: wild, wicked, practically nonstop action driven by a restless camera and rat-a-tat editing.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00006L92S", "B0085Z3ABI", "B0002O7XUE", "B00AJXO4FA", "B00005QAP3", "B00005JP3R", "B002FOFX9C", "B002I9Z8G2", "B009Z4AAK2", "B00005JA8B", "B00005O5B6", "B000NVT0TI", "B001O2UTS6"], "bought_together": ["B00005QAP3", "B00005O5B6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0041QSZFQ", "B004SUDQ6I"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 106244}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.98, "brand": "LION&#39;S GATE ENTERTAINMENT", "asin": "1573624063", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71TGKSE2B3L._SY300_.gif", "title": "Mean Guns"}

Stoltz, absolutely unrecognizable under lots and lots of prosthetic makeup, is quite good, as are Cher (as Rocky's mother) and Sam Elliott (Rocky's father figure).

{"description": "After Hammer Studios rewrote the histories of Frankenstein, Dracula, and the Mummy it was only natural to take on the howling hirsute one. Discarding the cursed gypsies, blooming wolfsbane, and chanted legends that swirl through Universal'sThe Wolf Man, director Terence Fisher and screenwriter John Elder (a pseudonym for producer Anthony Hinds) returned to Guy Endore's novelThe Werewolf of Parisfor inspiration. Switching locations to 18th-century Spain (to make use of standing sets from a canceled production about the Spanish Inquisition), this is a story of sex, sadism, and decadence, a curse produced from human evil. Young orphan Leon, the progeny of a mad, animalistic prisoner and a ravaged young peasant, is plagued with nightmares while village sheep are slaughtered, but it isn't until he grows into the stocky young Oliver Reed that his curse takes its terrifying toll. Reed cuts an intense figure as the brooding, serious young man and makes a marvelous werewolf, moving with a boxer's grace under feral makeup that looks as much ape as canine.Curse of the Werewolfhas all the cleavage and blood you'd expect from a Hammer film, but it's Fisher's eerie touches that make the film so gripping: a dog's howl anticipates the crying of the newborn Leon, holy water ripples as if coming to a boil before his christening, and the wild-eyed, fanged boy struggles against the bars in his room consumed in a canine bloodlust.--Sean Axmaker", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 309104}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "title": "Curse of Werewolf [VHS]", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B0009X770O", "B0067LXQA2", "B001B9ZVVC"]}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51S1S3RGTSL._SY300_.jpg", "asin": "6300185869"}

Murphy plays a convict on a two-day furlough from prison to help capture his former partner (James Remar).

But it is a delightful and somewhat  unexpected combination of exciting elements: Victorian-era, foggy-London  mystique, Gothic horror, and Indiana Jones-like exotica. Nicholas Rowe plays  Holmes as a schoolboy at a boarding academy for young men. Paired with the  owlish, reticent young Watson (Alan Cox), Holmes embarks on the solution of a  mystery that involves a hallucinatory and lethal drug, and a religious cult celebrating ancient Egyptian rites of mummification. Levinson makes handsome  and crisp work of this Steven Spielberg production, without a trace of the  treacle that often found its way into other Spielbergian projects at the time  (The Goonies). Rowe is wonderfully  convincing as a teen incarnation of the Great Detective, and while Cox mostly  maintains Hollywood's traditionally unflattering idea of Watson, he does  bring warmth and comedy to the role. The cast includes Freddie Jones as an  eccentric inventor, Anthony Higgins as the villain, and Sophie Ward as  Holmes's love interest.--Tom Keogh", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 536183}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.74, "brand": "", "asin": "6300214508", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51NPVMVW7WL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Young Sherlock Holmes [VHS]"}
{"description": "The era of Molly Ringwald's profitable collaboration with writer-producer-director John Hughes (Sixteen Candles,The Breakfast Club) was at its peak with this 1986 film (directed by Howard Deutch but in every sense part of the developing Hughes empire). Ringwald plays a high school girl on the budget side of the tracks, living with her warm and loving father (Harry Dean Stanton) and usually accompanied by her insecure best friend (Jon Cryer). When a wealthy but well-meaning boy (Andrew McCarthy) asks her out, her perspective is overturned and Cryer's character is threatened. As was the case in the mid-'80s, Hughes (who wrote the script and produced the film) brought his special feel for the cross-currents of adolescent life to this story. In its very commercial way, it is an honest, entertaining piece about growing pains. The attractive supporting cast (many of whom are much better known now) does a terrific job, and Ringwald and Cryer have excellent chemistry.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["630018403X", "6300183467", "6300214753", "6300214370", "0767825411", "6300213668", "6302862787", "0784011923", "B0000048S1", "6304932553", "6302765536", "6302091632", "630442972X", "6300269639", "6300215814", "6302824729", "6301570723", "B00000490M", "B00000JGEI", "0783216084", "0790731436", "6305814694", "6303344224", "6300183181", "B00005B6ND", "0800109481", "6300263673", "0783220804", "6303236863", "B000059XVO", "B00023BLXA", "6303540082", "6301827732", "6302374189", "6301966988", "B0000BWVBD", "B00006G8LB", "B00008DZ83", "B000059XY5", "6303212379", "6304263457", "6300215695", "630362572X", "B000055YW4", "6301412761", "6303123244", "6304209266", "6304773366", "B000R3KOWE"], "bought_together": ["630018403X", "6300183467"], "also_viewed": ["B001AEF6BI", "6300183467", "0790742322", "6304718551", "6303212379", "6300214540", "6301412761", "6300182207", "0767825411", "6302814782", "B00004TWZK", "630339406X", "6300263673", "6300213005", "6300214370", "6304509154", "6300213986", "6300182916"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 255262}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.45, "brand": "", "asin": "6300214710", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516554BJ34L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Pretty in Pink [VHS]"}

{"description": "After dominating the teen-movie genre for the bulk of the 1980s, writer-producer (and sometimes director) John Hughes proved that he had at least one good movie left in him before squandering his talent on lame comedies throughout the 1990s. LikeThe Breakfast ClubandPretty in Pink,Some Kind of Wonderfultreated its teenaged characters like real people with real feelings, hopes, fears, and desire. Mary Stuart Masterson gives a great performance as a tomboy drummer named Watts who's secretly in love with her best friend, Keith (Eric Stoltz), an aspiring artist who is oblivious to her affection because he's got a crush on Amanda (Lea Thompson), the popular high school beauty. Watts will even go so far as to chauffeur a date for Keith and Amanda, if only to prove--after a lot of patient, emotional anguish--that she's better for Keith than Amanda could ever be. The movie's drama comes from Keith's gradual realization that there's more to love than surface attraction, and Hughes gets extra mileage out of the romantic confusion by allowing Thompson's character to be more than a shallow campus cutie. All three of the leads are good fits in their roles, and this was one of the few teen films of the '80s to add genuine depth to its mainstream appeal. It's one of the few John Hughes movies to stand the test of time.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301008960", "630018403X", "6300214370", "6300263673", "6302814782", "6302862787", "6300214753", "6300184269", "6300268993"], "bought_together": ["6301008960", "6300214370"], "also_viewed": ["B00004TWZK", "B00AEFXXMI", "B00E3QJ7FG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 315546}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.47, "brand": "", "asin": "6300218031", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HHAMC0EML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Some Kind of Wonderful [VHS]"}
{"description": "Bruce Lee kicked around Hollywood for years looking in vain for an American break when Hong Kong came calling. As Kato in the TV series The Green Hornet he had become an Asian star (the series was renamed for his character when it crossed the Pacific) and ripe for his own vehicle. This raw, low-budget effort, called The Big Boss in its native Hong Kong, is a generic revenge drama enlivened by Lee's intense screen presence and martial arts prowess. He's a country boy who takes a job at a Thailand ice-packing plant and discovers it's a cover for heroin smuggling. Lee is held back through the first half of the film by a promise he made his sweet, gray-haired mom not to brawl (which means you have to wait to see him in action), but his indignation turns to fury as friends and coworkers disappear and the boss sends thugs to take care of the brooding, intense country boy. The final half of the film is a series of violent confrontations, culminating in a marvelously choreographed showdown at the ice plant. Lean, mean Lee, with a physique that looked sculpted in bronze, became an overnight sensation with this film, breaking all Asian box-office records and starting an international kung fu craze, but none of the pretenders ever touched Lee's cool cinematic charisma or his martial arts grace. Lee returned the next year in The Chinese Connection. --Sean Axmaker", "related": {"bought_together": ["6300250164"], "also_viewed": ["B00005OSN6", "B0015RCUQO", "B00005B1X4", "6300250164"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 574610}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 0.7, "brand": "", "asin": "6300250156", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41BYRDFFDSL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Fists of Fury [VHS]"}
{"description": "Despite the presence of hack director Arthur Hiller, this hybrid comedy-thriller works most of the time as pleasant faux Hitchcock. Gene Wilder is a book editor who is relaxing by taking a cross-country train ride. Then he gets caught up in a murder--and becomes a suspect. It's up to him to prove his own innocence. As noted, the script, by Colin Higgins, owes a big debt to Alfred Hitchcock; but the mystery isn't all that mysterious and the comedy isn't all that hilarious--at least not until Richard Pryor shows up, which is at least halfway through the film. Things definitely pick up from there. Jill Clayburgh, as the love interest, is merely along for the train ride.

The town's eccentric inhabitants, eventful night sky, and stunning scenery soak into his psyche and combine to bring a very different Mac to the surface, a Mac who collects seashells, walks on the beach in his jeans instead of his suit, and throws his calendar watch, beeping \"meeting time in Houston,\" into the sea.Mac eventually vies to switch places with Gordon Urquhart--accountant, bartender, innkeeper, and community representative in the land deal. After an evening spent drinking 42-year-old scotch (\"old enough to be out on its own,\" Mac chirps, and then laughs smugly at his own joke) and negotiating the real estate deal, Mac tries to negotiate a deal for himself--to trade his high-rise Houston apartment, Porsche, and oil-company job for Urquhart's less traditional, but more fulfilling, life.The plot runs along almost as if behind the scenes, and the characters are intriguing, but the real appeal here is the incisive yet gentle humor. During a visit to a Knox Oil lab, Mac is shown into a room that contains a miniature of the town he has been sent to purchase. The head of the lab says, \"Welcome to our little world,\" and then gives Mac the plastic replica of the town as a souvenir. \"Dream large,\" he intones.

{"description": "Director Francis Ford Coppola and executive producer George Lucas shared a strong desire to film the story of Preston Tucker, the man who revolutionized car design in the late 1940s, only to have his innovation squelched by the \"big three\" automakers in a legal battle between Tucker and powerful political lobbies. Coppola surely related to and sympathized with Tucker as a visionary underdog, and so this stylish, energetic film envisions \"the man and his dream\" in idealistic terms--an unabashed optimist (played by Jeff Bridges) who realizes his vision through blind faith and tenacity. Martin Landau gives a superb, heartbreaking performance as an associate who desperately wants to share Tucker's enthusiasm, but knows that corporate wolves are knocking at the door and will soon burst in with fangs bared. Joan Allen is equally good as Tucker's supportive wife, and the film's combination of dazzling costumes, production design, and the fabulous Tucker itself (of which only 50 models were made) creates an infectious atmosphere of postwar optimism. In the end, however, this fascinating film is much like Coppola himself: possessed of genius, blinded by ambition, and prone to create works of erratic brilliance. Don't take that as criticism, however; this is a sharp, underrated film about a dreamer whose dream was a worthy one, even if it only briefly came true.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300246965", "B00097E6V8"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 334350}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.97, "brand": "", "asin": "6301217861", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51N963ZG7HL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Tucker--The Man and His Dream [VHS]"}

{"description": "This adaptation of the F. Scott Fitzgerald novel, scripted by Francis Ford Coppola, puts costume design and art direction above the intricacies of character. It's certainly a handsome try, and perhaps no movie could captureThe Great Gatsbyin its entirety. Robert Redford is an interesting casting choice as Gatsby, the millionaire isolated in his mansion, still dreaming of the woman he lost. And Sam Waterston is perfect as the narrator, Nick, who brings the dream girl Daisy Buchanan back to Gatsby. No, the problem seems to be that director Jack Clayton fell in love with the flapper dresses and the party scenes and the Jazz Age tunes, ending up with a Classics Illustrated version of a great book rather than a fresh, organic take on the text. While Redford grows more quietly intriguing in the film, Mia Farrow's pallid performance as Daisy leaves you wondering why Gatsby, or anyone else, should care so much about his grand passion. The effective supporting cast includes Bruce Dern as Daisy's husband, and Scott Wilson and Karen Black as the low-rent couple whose destinies cross the sun-drenched protagonists. (That's future star Patsy Kensit as Daisy's little daughter.) The film won two Oscars--not surprisingly, for costumes and musical score.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["0800125762", "6302816629", "6300182215", "6305718792", "6300215814", "B0001E7LQG", "6304925158", "6302415853", "6302281415", "6300216500", "6300262782", "6303052223", "0790744759", "0800124693", "0792839846", "6304039522", "0800106032", "6302936381", "6303823351", "630382336X", "0792110803"], "bought_together": ["0743273567"], "also_viewed": ["B00DHHWXYY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 232595}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 18.65, "brand": "", "asin": "6301247485", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51XW0FSNT7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Great Gatsby [VHS]"}
{"description": "Holy camp site, Batman! After a fabulously successful season on TV, the campy comic book adventure hit the big screen, complete with painful puns, outrageous supervillains, and fights punctuated with word balloons sporting such onomatopoeic syllables as \"Pow!,\" \"Thud!,\" and \"Blammo!\" Adam West's wooden Batman is the cowled vigilante alter ego of straight-arrow millionaire Bruce Wayne and Bruce Ward's Robin (a.k.a. Dick Grayson, Bruce's young collegiate prot&eacute;g&eacute;) his overeager sidekick in hot pants. Together they battle an unholy alliance of Gotham City's greatest criminals: the Joker (Cesar Romero, whooping up a storm), the Riddler (giggling Frank Gorshin), the Penguin (cackling Burgess Meredith), and the purr-fectly sexy Catwoman (Lee Meriwether slinking in a skin-tight black bodysuit). The criminals are, naturally, out to conquer the world, but with a little help from their unending supply of utility belt devices (bat shark repellent, anyone?), our dynamic duo thwarts their nefarious plans at every turn. Since the TV show ran under 30 minutes an episode (with commercials), the 105-minute film runs a little thin--a little camp goes a long way--but fans of the small-screen show will enjoy the spoofing tone throughout.

{"description": "One of the later Spencer Tracy-Katharine Hepburn matchups, this time pitting efficiency expert--sorry, that's \"methods engineer\"--Richard Sumner (Tracy) against TV-network research whiz Bunny Watson (Hepburn) over adding a new-fangled computer--again, sorry, that's \"electronic brain\"--to her department, thereby threatening her and her colleagues' livelihoods. Gig Young appears as Bunny's beau, an ambitious network executive who strings her along and becomes apoplectic at the idea that she doesn't need him. But as always, it's Hepburn and Tracy's bickering-flirting that makes this such a winning enterprise--a lunch date that turns into an interrogation and their sly repartee during a Christmas party are a couple of the movie's hilarious highlights.

{"description": "Thanks to an extraordinary, delicately balanced performance by Peter Sellers,Being Therereceived mixed reviews during its theatrical release in 1979, but has since become a celebrated comedy with a loyal following. It's one of the most unusual black comedies ever made, simply because it stretches a simple premise over 130 minutes of straight-faced, strangely compelling commentary on politics, media, and celebrity in media-savvy America. Adapted by Jerzy Kozinsky from his own novel, the movie's about a simple-minded, middle-aged gardener who, after a lifetime of seclusion and safety in a Washington, D.C. townhouse, gets his first exposure to reality beyond the walls of his sheltered existence. His only reference to the world is through his childlike addiction to television, and when a chance encounter brings him into the inner fold of a dying billionaire (Melvyn Douglas), he suddenly finds himself the toast of Washington's political elite. His simple phrases about gardening are misinterpreted as anything from economic predictions to sage political advice, and under the sharp direction of Hal Ashby, Sellers has the audacity to take this comedic conceit to its logical extreme.Being Thereis not for all tastes--especially not for those who don't appreciate comedic subtlety. But as a showcase for the daring genius of Peter Sellers, this is a classic movie in a category all its own.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300216268", "6300181340"], "bought_together": ["6300216268"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 314447}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.89, "brand": "", "asin": "6301590740", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514HH6RMXYL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Being There [VHS]"}

The mass of humanity has descended into speechless savagery, kept as captive animals by the talking apes who have inherited the world. Two astronauts from our time have landed here, retracing the path of their lost comrade, Captain Taylor (Charlton Heston). Unfortunately, they've landed in the middle of a grim situation. Warlike gorillas are preparing to eliminate the last shards of shattered human civilization, a degenerate, subterranean cult worshipping the greatest of all human achievements--the cobalt bomb. As well as rescuing Taylor, the two men have to stop the gorillas from wiping out humanity ... and stop humanity from fulfilling their self-appointed, self-destructive destiny. This is both thrill-a-minute science fiction and a surprisingly deep reflection on the human condition.

{"description": "Troubled twentysomething Craig Sheffer is haunted by violent dreams of serial killings and nocturnal invitations by misshapen creatures who live in a misty, mysterious land called Midia. Adapted and directed by Clive Barker (Hellraiser) from his novel Cabal, this tribute to the magical creatures of the night plays like a Jungian reinterpretation of classic myths with a modern twist. Nightbreed are the dead reborn as monsters of legend, fantasies, and nightmares who form their own outcast society in an underground city beneath an Alberta graveyard. Visionary horror director David Cronenberg steps in front of the camera to play Sheffer's unscrupulous psychiatrist, an eerie, unsettling character whose dark side is hidden under a soft-spoken manner and an eerily calm and controlled voice.\n\nBarker has a rather unsubtle approach to this fantastical Holocaust metaphor: every human is a victim, a hick, or a bloodthirsty monster, and the climactic witch-hunt is all gore and spectacle. By contrast the bestial society of outcasts has a kind of natural, innocent savagery that turns protective when the tribe is threatened. Cool-looking beings of bright colors, latex masks, and outrageous bodysuits, they band together like some extreme mutant superhero team with anger-management issues. Barker could use more attention to details (what happened to the so-called mystic properties of his shape-shifting monster heroes when the guns were drawn?), but there's an undeniable charge to his modern take on myth and magic. --Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000066X4", "0783112572", "B00023NRSM", "0792839234", "6305095566", "6301327845", "B003TX8Q6K", "B00000IQUT"], "also_viewed": ["B003RZ1XGA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 390461}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.24, "brand": "", "asin": "630168740X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21RQT1BWGAL.jpg", "title": "Night Breed [VHS]"}
{"description": "A tale about a fatherless boy finding dramatically different father figures throughout a remarkable adventure,Treasure Islandis an  entertaining coming-of-age story, with themes of family, loyalty, friendship, trust, and honesty at its core. While Robert Louis Stevenson's classic adventure tale is popular film  fare, it's never been done this well. Charlton Heston stars as Long John Silver and Christian Bale as plucky Jim Hawkins in this TNT production. Directed by Heston's son Fraser (who also directed the excellent family fareAlaska), the film remains faithful to the novel, and draws much of the spirit and excitement of the book. The action scenes are first-rate, and  if the shipHispaniolahas never looked better or more authentic, no surprise: the ship is the original from 1962'sMutiny on the Bounty. The opening scenes are dark and rich, as they capture the period well, with careful attention to makeup (the teeth, the body grime!) and costuming. Oliver Reed and Christopher Lee are frighteningly effective as Capt.&nbsp;Billy Bones and Blind Pew, and the film's first half-hour is theirs. The tone shifts and lightens when Heston appears as the legendary pirate. Look for Pete Postlethwaite, Julian Glover, and Richard Johnson in wonderful supporting roles. The film marks Bale's segue from poignantly promising child actor (Empire of the Sun) to compelling teen (he would later continue to prove his talent as a versatile young actor inLittle WomenandVelvet Goldmine).--N.F.

John Huston directed this superbly calibrated crime classic, which displays his usual wry appreciation of fringies and down-and-outers. This time the task for Huston's eccentric ensemble is a jewel robbery, which--this being a Huston film--can't possibly work out as well as its plan. The cast includes Sam Jaffee, indelible as a criminal mastermind, and the pre-stardom Marilyn Monroe. Hayden plays the kind of mug he would revisit in Stanley Kubrick'sThe Killing, which is an informal homage to this film.

As the film opens, the seemingly open-and-shut trial of a young Puerto Rican accused of murdering his father with a knife has just concluded and the 12-man jury retires to their microscopic, sweltering quarters to decide the verdict. When the votes are counted, 11 men rule guilty, while one--played by Henry Fonda, again typecast as another liberal, truth-seeking hero--doubts the obvious. Stressing the idea of \"reasonable doubt,\" Fonda slowly chips away at the jury, who represent a microcosm of white, male society--exposing the prejudices and preconceptions that directly influence the other jurors' snap judgments. The tight script by Reginald Rose (based on his own teleplay) presents each juror vividly using detailed soliloquies, all which are expertly performed by the film's flawless cast.

{"description": "Jerome Kern and Oscar Hammerstein II'sShowboat, based on Edna Ferber's 1926 novel, is a seminal American musical, the first to explore serious themes (most notably racism) and to truly integrate song with story and character. The plot follows three generations of a theatrical Mississippi riverboat family from the 1880s to the 1920s. The 1936 film version, directed by Englishman James Whale (Frankenstein), is probably the one that best captures the spirit its creators intended. First and foremost, it features Paul Robeson as Joe. His indelible rendition of \"Ol' Man River,\" delivered strong, straight, and without bathos, is a stunningly powerful anthem about the plight of African Americans in the United States. (The song is set against a fascinating expressionist montage in 1930s social realist style.) Other standout performances include torch singer Helen Morgan as Julie, the actress banished from the showboat for her \"mixed race\" ancestry. Her \"Bill\" and \"Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man\" are simply sublime. Hattie McDaniel (Gone With the Wind) is her usual outrageous self. Irene Dunne (The Awful Truth) is spunky and delightful as Magnolia Ravenal. Her most endearing moment occurs early in the film when she leads the company in a funky cakewalk, swinging her hips with joyful abandon. (She also does a number in blackface!)

{"description": "F.W. Murnau changed the name and ghastly appearance of his villain, but this unauthorized version of Bram Stoker'sDraculacouldn't fool the Stoker estate, and it became the center of a lawsuit that almost resulted in its complete destruction. Thankfully this masterpiece survives (though in a somewhat altered form), for despite its liberties with the novel, this 1921 horror classic remains the most beautiful and resonant interpretation of Stoker. Though the plot remains essentially the same--naive real-estate clerk Thomas (Gustav von Wangenheim) is sent abroad to finalize a sale with the nocturnal Count Orlock (the hideous-looking Max Schreck), who imprisons Thomas and travels to England to claim Thomas's beautiful young wife, Ellen (Greta Schroder), as his own--the visual realization creates a very different story. Schreck plays the vampire as a grotesque demon, with his claw-like hands, bald head and sharp, bat-like ears, and he rises from his coffin with an supernatural stiffness, like a tent pole pulled upright. When the eerily empty ghost ship carrying his coffin arrives in Thomas's home port, a river of rats pours out and spreads through the town like a plague. Perhaps the most noticeable changes from the novel are the absence of Van Helsing and the richer realization of Ellen, the would-be victim, whose innate sensibility and solemn spirituality give her a spooky connection with the vampire. With his stark, symbol-laden visual scheme and sacrificial conclusion, Murnau creates a more mythic tale than any subsequent adaptation of Stoker's novel.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000067JAW", "6300183084", "6303626424", "6300183092"], "also_viewed": ["630526323X", "B00HRUQ8X4"]}, "price": 24.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 311149}, "asin": "6302194296", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41VWHHY3ZJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Nosferatu [VHS]"}

In Romero's story, a woman (Adrienne Barbeau) and her lover hypnotize her ailing, older husband into signing over his riches.

In Argento's tale, a crime-scene photographer (Harvey Keitel) kills his live-in girlfriend in a fit of jealous rage, but her black cat continues to torment him after her death. While Romero's piece toys with horror conventions and Argento's plays out in his typically elongated fashion, their dramatic story lines, unexpectedly gruesome imagery, and ironic endings shock some life into the movie.

Borrowing its subtitle (and several lines of dialogue) from Shakespeare, the movie finds Admiral Kirk (William Shatner) and his fellowEnterprisecrew members on a diplomatic mission to negotiate peace with the revered Klingon Chancellor Gorkon (David Warner). When the high-ranking Klingon and several officers are ruthlessly murdered, blame is placed on Kirk, whose subsequent investigation uncovers an assassination plot masterminded by the nefarious Klingon General Chang (Christopher Plummer) in an effort to disrupt a historic peace summit. As this political plot unfolds,Star Trek VItakes on a sharp-edged tone, with Kirk and Spock confronting their opposing views of diplomacy, and testing their bonds of loyalty when a Vulcan officer is revealed to be a traitor. With a dramatic depth befitting what was to be the final movie mission of the originalStar Trekcrew, this film took the veteran cast out in respectably high style.

{"description": "Like moths to a flame, great actors gravitate to the singular genius of playwright-screenwriter David Mamet, who updated his Pulitzer Prize-winning play for this all-star screen adaptation. The material is not inherently cinematic, so the movie's greatest asset is Mamet's peerless dialogue and the assembly of a once-in-a-lifetime cast led by Al Pacino, Jack Lemmon, and Alec Baldwin (the last in a role Mamet created especially for the film). Often regarded as a critique of the Reagan administration's impact on the American economy, the play and film focus on a competitive group of real estate salesmen who've gone from feast to famine in a market gone cold. When an executive \"motivator\" (Alec Baldwin) demands a sales contest among the agents in the cramped office, the stakes are critically high: any agent who fails to meet his quota of sales \"leads\" (i.e., potential buyers) will lose his job. This intense ultimatum is a boon for the office superstar (Pacino), but a once-successful salesman (Lemmon) now finds himself clinging nervously to faded glory. Political and personal rivalries erupt under pressure when the other agents (Alan Arkin, Ed Harris) suspect the office manager (Kevin Spacey) of foul play. This cauldron of anxiety, tension, and sheer desperation provides fertile soil for Mamet's scathingly rich dialogue, which is like rocket fuel for some of the greatest actors of our time. Pacino won an Oscar nomination for his volatile performance, but it's Lemmon who's the standout, doing some of the best work of his distinguished career. Director James Foley shapes Mamet's play into a stylish, intensely focused film that will stand for decades as a testament to its brilliant writer and cast.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303515223", "1558807780"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 369412}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.3, "brand": "", "asin": "6302732875", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51S2V1ZW1GL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Glengarry Glen Ross [VHS]"}
{"description": "One of the most subtle and deeply felt--if ultimately downbeat--collaborations between Jack Nicholson and director Bob Rafelson, this film was Rafelson's follow-up toFive Easy Pieces. Nicholson plays a disc jockey whose withdrawn personality translates to radio mystery. But he's out of his depth when he goes home to Atlantic City at the invitation of ne'er-do-well brother Bruce Dern. Dern has a big-money scam that's also high risk, particularly to himself if the black-crime syndicate he's ripping off ever gets wind of it. But Nicholson gets swept up in the blarney of his charismatic older brother, even as he suffers gnawing doubts about the way Big Bro treats his lady friends (including Ellen Burstyn).

Sean Nelson delivers a quiet but intense performance as Michael--street name Fresh--a cynical but introspective kid grown up fast and hard on the killing streets of the projects. Samuel L. Jackson costars as Fresh's estranged father, a speed chess hustler in the city park whose dispassionate philosophy--the chess board as life--becomes the film's central metaphor, as Fresh plots a brilliant, coldly brutal plan to save himself and his junkie sister from his world of drug dealers and street violence. Yakin's assured direction delivers a vividly realized world in bold, crisp images and an austere but poetic style that captures the dispassionate point of view of a heart-hardened adolescent street survivor. The excellent score by former Police-man  Stewart Copeland, his most haunting sinceRumblefish, mixes smooth symphonic sounds with bluesy guitars and syncopated percussion, giving the soundtrack the same sad intimacy as Yakin's visuals. The world of Fresh is alive with danger that  threatens to extinguish all the wonder and joy of childhood--the film's most devastating moment observes Fresh helplessly trying to stop the bleeding of a schoolmate, a girl he has a crush on, caught by a stray bullet from a senseless playground murder.

Though Wood died in obscurity as an alcoholic in 1978, his films have been considered cult classics for years. He is consistently voted the worst director who ever lived. You would think this an odd subject, but director Tim Burton harnesses the undying hopefulness that made Wood such a character. Shot in black and white, just like Wood's creations, this stylized, witty production captures the poetic absurdity of Wood's films and his unconventional life. Burton's recreation of Wood's wonderfully awfulPlan 9 from Outer Spacelooks much better than the original low-budget quickie. Burton tackled an extremely strange subject matter for a biopic, but Wood is presented as naive almost to the point of delusion, so the story works. The pace sags in the middle, as the weirdness starts to wear thin, but Depp proves himself an adroit actor, even while wearing angora and a blonde wig. Wood's unconventional repertoire company is faithfully reproduced, including an Academy Award-winning Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi.

The results may sometimes veer toward soap opera, especially with the screen frequently filled with adoring close-ups of Omar Sharif and Julie Christie, but Lean's gift for cramming the screen with spectacle is not to be denied. The streets of Moscow, the snowy steppes of Russia, the house in the country taken over by ice; these are re-created with Lean's unerring sense of grandness.

Sharif, who achieved stardom in Lean's previous film,Lawrence of Arabia, mostly looks noble, but the supporting cast is spiky: Rod Steiger as a fat-cat monster, Tom Courtenay as a self-righteous revolutionary, and Klaus Kinski and Alec Guinness in smaller roles. Geraldine Chaplin, in her adult debut, plays the doctor's compliant wife. Robert Bolt's screenplay won one of the film's five Oscars&reg;, with another going to perhaps the most immediately recognizable element of the movie: Maurice Jarre's romantic music, with its hugely popular \"Lara's Theme\" weaving in and out of a swooning score.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["0800116917", "6305123616", "0800132009", "6300185095", "0792839846", "B0000048ZL", "B00000F6D1", "B0000048YM", "B000GG4Y32", "6302098424", "B0000068ZQ", "6304400551", "6303494390", "6303057225", "B00006ADD5", "6301965701", "0790743213", "6301797957", "6303854311", "B00000FZCU", "0792116887", "B00004RGUU", "6300215539", "6303562248", "6300268748", "6302360978", "6303029027", "6302415853", "6300216721", "630018224X", "6302909023", "6302842263", "6300268799", "B00005Q4GY", "6301964012", "B00004TYS8", "6300216195", "6303402348", "6300215814", "0800199421", "6300246965", "6304039522", "0783226152", "6301607929", "6302226899", "6304005989", "0783235593", "0790751089", "630442972X", "B000006N70", "6300216012", "0790752395", "6301969413", "0792841026", "6303686745", "630196733X", "6300216748", "6302424909", "0783221347", "6304214502", "B00000IO4G"], "bought_together": ["0800116917", "0800132009"], "also_viewed": ["B009L2EW98", "0792151712", "0800116917", "0790743159", "6304239149", "6301792769", "6304089767", "155890641X", "6301628454", "6301792734", "B00000K3AN"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 381443}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.0, "brand": "", "asin": "6303599109", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51SZ5GR64CL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Doctor Zhivago - 30th Anniversary Edition [VHS]"}

{"description": "This haunting classic of the silent screen is familiar to every graduate of Film 101. Like Eisenstein'sBattleship Potemkin, Godard'sBreathless, and Welles'sCitizen Kane, Caligari helped define a cinematic school... and forever changed the way the world made movies. It's also great fun, even for modern audiences.The film begins with two men trading horror stories. One promises the other a terrifying true tale--the harrowing story of his fianc&eacute;e's narrow escape from death. Here's the story: an amoral asylum director wants to see if he can order somnambulist patient Cesare to commit murder. To this end, the nefarious doctor masquerades as a traveling showman and picks victims from the gawking carnival crowds. He sends his sleepwalker out to execute bloody deeds by night--crimes of which Cesare is barely aware. Soon, Cesare abducts the narrator's girl and is caught ... which is only the beginning of the surprises.Caligari's world became the textbook example of 1920s German Expressionist cinema--a cockeyed dreamscape, where black-clad actors feverishly chase each other across moody, barely-realistic sets. Think of films such asDark Cityor theNightmare Before ChristmasorSaturday Night Live's \"Sprockets\" sketches.

Anne (Amanda Root) is captivated when she meets the dignified naval officer Capt. Wentworth (Ciar&aacute;n Hinds), but she is advised to discourage his romantic overtures because he has no fortune. They meet again eight years later, but now Capt. Wentworth has become wealthy while Anne's father is in reduced circumstances in the wake of reckless extravagance. A series of circumstances ensue which prevent Anne and Wentworth from expressing their mutual and inevitable love. The film's success depends entirely on the subtle, superb performances of Root and Hinds. The film builds slowly, occasionally leaving you wondering if anything at all is going to happen. When it does, you realize how carefully crafted a film this is, and the final result is grandly rewarding.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303921248", "6304346107", "6300249824", "B004XVMCMQ", "6304087977", "6305892806", "6304057709", "6304383827", "6304595247", "6302719631", "6304178352", "B002DY9KR0"], "bought_together": ["6303921248"], "also_viewed": ["0800141660", "B00AF82WTO", "B00G6HO368", "B000244FFU"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 302356}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.88, "brand": "", "asin": "6303965415", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Q908A5Y4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Persuasion [VHS]"}
{"description": "This true story of the black flyers who broke the color barrier in the U.S. Air Force during World War II is a well-intentioned film highlighted by an excellent cast. Proud, solemn, Iowa-born Laurence Fishburne and city-kid hipster Cuba Gooding Jr. are among the hopefuls who meet en route to Tuskegee Air Force Base, where they are among the recruits for an \"experimental\" program to \"prove\" the abilities of the black man in the U.S. armed services. Fighting prejudice from racist officers and government officials and held to a consistently higher level of performance than their white counterparts, these men prove themselves in training and in combat, many of them dying for their country in the process. Andre Braugher costars as a West Point graduate who takes charge of the unit in Africa and in Italy (where it's christened the 332nd). The film is rousing, if slow starting and episodic, but it's periodically grounded by a host of war movie clich&eacute;s, notably the calculated demise of practically every trainee introduced in the opening scenes (ironic given the 332nd's real-life combat record--high casualties for the enemy, low casualties among themselves, and no losses among the bombers they escorted). Ultimately the Emmy-nominated performances by moral backbone Fishburne and the dedicated Braugher and the energy and cocky confidence of Gooding give their battles both on and off the battlefield the sweet taste of victory.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000094J5T", "0790735431", "630018157X"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 372152}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 2.75, "brand": "", "asin": "6304039255", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515V2S5R95L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Tuskegee Airmen [VHS]"}
{"description": "Bruce McDonald's wry adaptation of aW.P.

Silas  Crow (Ryan Black) is a drifting young fellow dragging his feet about entering  a school for auto mechanics.  While loosely entertaining the idea of writing,  Silas unprofitably kills all his time with a thickheaded buddy, Frank  Fencepost (Adam Beach), and watches his old girlfriend, Sadie Maracle  (Jennifer Podemski), grow away from him as she takes up native issues with  admirable commitment.  A visit by Silas's older sister, Ilianna (Lisa LaCroix)  (with her new, white-and-uptight husband reluctantly in tow), plus the  simultaneous reappearance of Ilianna's old flame, ex-con Gooch (Michael  Greyeyes), and the unpunished murder of a native girl by a white thug set off  a series of events culminating in redemptive acts of love and honor.  Big  themes, yes, but McDonald (Highway 61) has wisely chosen to emphasize  the charm of his characters, make sport of spiritual clich&eacute;s and Indian chic  (there's a funny bit in which Silas gets Ilianna's husband drunk and  introduces him to a bogus animal guide), and allow the cruelty of white  justice against natives to speak (often comically) for itself.--Tom  Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000087F0X"], "bought_together": ["B000087F0X"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 428064}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 21.8, "brand": "Alliance Atlantis", "asin": "6304137168", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DXHCJH44L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Dance Me Outside [VHS]"}
{"description": "Having developed his skill as a master of contemporary crime drama, writer-director Michael Mann displayed every aspect of that mastery in this intelligent, character-driven thriller from 1995, which also marked the first onscreen pairing of Robert De&nbsp;Niro and Al Pacino. The two great actors had played father and son in the separate time periods ofThe Godfather, Part&nbsp;II, but this was the first film in which the pair appeared together, and although their only scene together is brief, it's the riveting fulcrum of this high-tech cops-and-robbers scenario. De&nbsp;Niro plays a master thief with highly skilled partners (Val Kilmer and Tom Sizemore) whose latest heist draws the attention of Pacino, playing a seasoned Los Angeles detective whose investigation reveals that cop and criminal lead similar lives. Both are so devoted to their professions that their personal lives are a disaster. Pacino's with a wife (Diane Venora) who cheats to avoid the reality of their desolate marriage; De&nbsp;Niro pays the price for a life with no outside connections; and Kilmer's wife (Ashley Judd) has all but given up hope that her husband will quit his criminal career. These are men obsessed, and as De&nbsp;Niro and Pacino know, they'll both do whatever's necessary to bring the other down. Mann's brilliant screenplay explores these personal obsessions and sacrifices with absorbing insight, and the tension mounts with some of the most riveting action sequences ever filmed--most notably a daylight siege that turns downtown Los Angeles into a virtual war zone of automatic gunfire. At nearly three hours, the film qualifies as a kind of intimate epic, certain to leave some viewers impatiently waiting for more action, but it's all part of Mann's compelling strategy.Heatis a true rarity: a crime thriller with equal measures of intense excitement and dramatic depth, giving De&nbsp;Niro and Pacino a prime showcase for their finely matched talents.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000003KHS", "6300183211", "B00000IO4G", "630018627X", "6303421563", "B00000JGEI", "6302415853", "630018403X", "0800199421", "6304258984", "0784011923", "6304259131", "6302482712", "6303953425", "B00007CVYA", "0783223218", "6300214540", "6302054982", "0790731274", "B00000ILE6", "0792147618", "079073799X", "6301208773", "6301888901", "0790701251", "0792133153", "6302378648", "6302282535", "6305718792", "6304414099", "6303696813", "0790748169", "B0002ZDVFE", "B000077VT7", "6303269834", "6302516919", "630428649X", "B00008R9K9", "6303036570", "6302814782", "0792116887", "0792158261", "0790705141", "6304508611", "6301071379", "B00005Q4GY", "076783819X", "6300214567", "6303020089", "6303383300", "6302945089", "B0002GTWOM", "B00003CXE6", "0792841778", "6301797930", "0800116917", "0800179552", "B0000040EJ", "B00005A7VC", "6300182878"], "also_viewed": ["B000003KHS"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 286071}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.98, "brand": "", "asin": "6304214502", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4160ZFH45VL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Heat [VHS]"}
{"description": "Freewayis one of those movies that has the power to simultaneously amaze and disgust just about anyone who dares to view it. LikeSeven,Kalifornia, andNatural Born Killers, it's a movie that could be called a product of our times, since it caters to our societal fascination with serial killers and outrageous psychopathic behavior. But make no mistake: director Matthew Bright isn't out to feed anyone's sickest impulse. This is a scathing satire in the age of Jerry Springer fistfights and &quot;real&quot; TV shows likeCops, in which the &quot;I-5 Killer&quot; (Kiefer Sutherland) meets a wayward teenager (Reese Witherspoon) on the freeway that provides his nickname. She confides in the man but soon discovers his gruesome intentions, and ... well, let's just say she effectively defends herself, only to find later that the killer (whose wife is played by Brooke Shields, no less!) has used the media to his advantage.

How do you play a game that hasn't any rules? That's what Douglas has to figure out, and he can't always rely on his intelligence to form logic out of what's happening to him. Seemingly cast as the fall guy in a conspiracy thriller, he encounters a waitress (Deborah Unger) who may or may not be trustworthy, and nothing can be taken at face value in a world turned upside down.

{"description": "On his evening commute, bored accountant Sugiyama (Koji Yakusho) always looks for the beautiful woman who gazes wistfully out the window of the Kishikawa School of Dancing. One night he gets off the train, walks into the studio, and signs up for a class. Soon Sugiyama is so engrossed in his dancing he practices his steps on the train platform and under his desk, and becomes good enough for competition, compelling his wife to hire a private investigator to find out why he stays out late and returns home smelling of perfume. Among the colorful characters Sugiyama meets is his coworker Aoki (Naoto Takenaka), who transforms himself from geeky systems analyst to hilariously flamboyant (and bad-wigged) lounge lizard. Aoki explains to Sugiyama, \"When I finish work, put on the clothes, the wig and become Donny Burns, Latin world champion, and I start to move to the rhythm, I'm so happy, so completely free.\" Here lies the chief charm ofShall We Dance, the contrast between the ultracompetitive women of the studio--including the one who caught Sugiyama's eye, Mai (Tamiyo Kusakari)--and the men who dance simply because they enjoy it. This 1996 film is somewhat comparable to the flamboyant Aussie favoriteStrictly Ballroom, butShall We Danceis especially noteworthy for contrasting the boldness of social dance with the buttoned-up societal mores of Japan, where people avoid public displays of emotion.

{"description": "A romantic drama in theMasterpiece Theatervein, this John Madden film looks at the relationship between Queen Victoria and John Brown, a commoner who, though a servant, becomes her closest friend and confidant. As such, he proves the catalyst to bring her back into public life and out of her private mourning for the late Prince Albert. But the closeness of their friendship sets tongues wagging about the impropriety of what appears to be an affair between queen and commoner (an issue the film never directly addresses). The film's charm lies in the flinty give-and-take between the wonderfully starchy Judi Dench as Victoria and the robust Scottish comedian Billy Connolly, here playing it straight as a strong-willed Scotsman who comes to enjoy the power he wields by virtue of having the queen's ear. Antony Sher is also striking as Prime Minister Disraeli, in a performance that all but shimmers with unspoken malice.--Marshall Fine", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 179264}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.99, "brand": "", "asin": "630482615X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51WHKP001HL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Mrs. Brown [VHS]"}
{"description": "Asian American director Ang Lee sums up America in the early 1970s by focusing on the arrival of the sexual revolution in the 'burbs. Isolationism within a family, consumerism, and selfishness are personified by a cast that captures the self-obsession within two New England families. As the children struggle awkwardly with adolescence, their parents stumble through sexual experimentation. In the days of Watergate and Vietnam, society is breaking boundaries and ignoring convention. Following suit, these families are eschewing polite barriers and social taboos, with disastrous results. The \"ice storm\" of the title refers not only to a natural phenomenon but is a (rather heavy-handed) metaphor for a pervasive emotional temperament. The entire cast delivers textured, finely nuanced performances. This movie lingers in the psyche not only for the scope of the tragedy at its conclusion, but for Lee's often humorous and stingingly accurate assessment of pop culture. Based on Rick Moody's novel, this won the best-screenplay award at Cannes in 1997.--Rochelle O'Gorman", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 146644}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.0, "brand": "", "asin": "6304844964", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4125A7MPSWL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Ice Storm [VHS]"}

{"description": "Making this movie represented a rather risky venture for Mel Gibson--it was his first effort at directing, and the role demanded that he deliberately obscure his sexy matinee-idol looks. Gibson seems to truly relish his Lon Chaney Jr.-esque turn as Justin McLeod, a reclusive former teacher with half his face and body badly scarred, and a dark, secret past. The folks in McLeod's postcard-pretty Maine town have dubbed him \"Hamburger Head\" and exchange malicious gossip about him. But one boy is needy enough to dare to penetrate the fortress McLeod has built against the outside world. Fatherless Chuck Norstadt (Nick Stahl) is so anxious to escape his dysfunctional family that he pesters McLeod into becoming his mentor. Their relationship for the most part avoids the sort of sticky sentimentality one might expect from Hollywood. Chuck is a real, credible kid, a petulant pain with a chip on his shoulder, and McLeod is no Mr. Chips. It's fun, and quite moving, to watch these two cranky misfits battle their way toward a friendship that will change both their lives. Margaret Whitton (Major League) gives an unaffected performance as Chuck's narcissistic mother. \"I'm just not cut out for this mothering racket,\" she tells her rudderless children, as she flits from man to man. Gibson's own personal code of honor, we suspect, is very much in evidence in this movie's message: One must take responsibility for what one wants in life.--Laura Mirsky", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 450110}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6305012814", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5128XQKSB4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Man Without A Face [VHS]"}
{"description": "In 1979, when most literary programs were being produced in the U.K., Boston public television station WGBH decided to produce a homegrown literary classic for its viewers. The result is this thoughtful four-episode adaptation of Nathaniel Hawthorne's novelThe Scarlet Letter. Meg Foster brings a quiet strength to Hester Prynne, the adulteress condemned by 17th-century Puritan laws to wear a scarlet \"A\" for the rest of her life. As her partner in crime, the Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale, John Heard writhes in private torment most convincingly. Kevin Conway completes this grim triangle as the mysterious, maleficent Roger Chillingworth. The costumes and scenery are simple, so as not to detract from the dialogue as each character grapples with the meaning of sin, forgiveness, and redemption. Students who struggle with the novel may find this video to be a more palatable version of the story--and a more faithful adaptation than the 1995 film starring Demi Moore.

{"description": "Completing the loosely connected trilogy that also includesMetropolitanandBarcelona, writer-director Whit Stillman brings his signature style to this casually structured but acerbically witty ode to... well, to the last days of disco.

In fact,  Stillman's film captures the same period with greater accuracy, and draws us into the waning disco craze with more incisive wit and deft handling of a first-rate cast.The film's casual plot revolves around six recent college graduates, and Stillman charts their clashes and intimacies with a keen sense of human foibles and frailties, pausing throughout for such characteristic touches as a hilarious conversation about the sexual politics of Disney'sLady and the Trampor the homoerotic subtext in an episode ofWild Kingdom. Sharp dialogue is in rich abundance here, and through it all Stillman captures the fading glory of disco as his characters make the transition toward adult responsibilities. It's here that we see how this film is subtly intertwined with Stillman's earlier work, and where we gain a fuller and more satisfying appreciation of a filmmaker who has carved a singular niche for himself in the world of independent movies.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303995713", "0790731150", "6303011411"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 219914}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 10.43, "brand": "", "asin": "6305128960", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4103CX1NG8L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Last Days of Disco [VHS]"}
{"description": "The 1998 testosterone-saturated blow-'em-up from producer Jerry Bruckheimer and director Michael Bay (The Rock,Bad Boys) continues Hollywood's millennium-fueled fascination with the destruction of our planet. There's no arguing that the successful duo understands what mainstream American audiences want in their blockbuster movies--loads of loud, eye-popping special effects, rapid- fire pacing, and patriotic flag waving. Bay's protagonists--the eight crude, lewd, oversexed (but lovable, of course) oil drillers summoned to save the world from a Texas-sized meteor hurling toward the earth--are not flawless heroes, but common men with whom all can relate. In this huge Western-in-space soap opera, they're American cowboys turned astronauts. Sci-fi buffs will appreciate Bay's fetishizing of technology, even though it's apparent he doesn't understand it as anything more than flashing lights and shiny gadgets. Smartly, the duo also tries to lure the art-house crowd, raiding the local indie acting stable and populating the film with guys like Steve Buscemi, Billy Bob Thornton, Owen Wilson, and Michael Duncan, all adding needed touches of humor and charisma. When Bay applies his sledgehammer aesthetics to the action portions of the film, it's mindless fun; it's only whenArmageddontackles humanity that it becomes truly offensive. Not sinceMississippi Burninghave racial and cultural stereotypes been substituted for characters so blatantly--African Americans, Japanese, Chinese, Scottish, Samoans, Muslims, French ... if it's not white and American, Bay simplifies it. Or, make that whitemaleAmerica; the film features only three notable females--four if you count the meteor, who's constantly referred to as a \"bitch that needs drillin',\" but she's a hell of a lot more developed and unpredictable than the other women characters combined. Sure, Bay's film creates some tension and contains some visceral moments, but if he can't create any redeemable characters outside of those in space, what's the point of saving the planet?--Dave McCoy", "related": {"also_bought": ["6304681496", "6304233639", "0783222475", "0792845684", "B00003CXTF", "B00004WIDB", "B00000JGEN", "0792151712", "B000007OY0", "B0001DI5W6", "0783222955", "6302610702", "079213690X", "6302909023", "6300215830", "6301976622", "6301643410"], "bought_together": ["6304681496"], "also_viewed": ["6301398912", "630382790X", "6304233639", "6300214540", "6303257844", "B000003KHS", "0792151712", "B000059XYK", "0800125762", "B00005JM5E", "6302415853", "B00005PJ8I", "0783241542", "B00003CXTF"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 194393}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.38, "brand": "Touchstone Home Video", "asin": "6305169187", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515Y886RQYL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Armageddon [VHS]"}

What's certain is that Modine's  character, Joe, is an aspiring actor with no prospects and Keener's character, Mary, is  a photographer's assistant with little joy. Joe leads us to Bob (Maxwell Caulfield), a soap opera star on a fetishistic search for a non-bottle blonde.

Sahara, a favorite  subject for Mary's shutterbug employer (Marlo Thomas), brings us full circle to  Joe's girl again. The net portrait is of a couple of men who burn up a lot of  energy diverting true passion toward junk causes (Bob's Freudian hang-up,  Joe's knee-jerk politics) and a couple of women who struggle to say what they  want.

Murphy phones it in, and Charles Dance (Pascali's Island) looks foolish in retrospect.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEFXP8K", "B00005JD5H", "B000MGBSE4", "B00AEBB9AA", "B000MGBLSC", "B00AEFY6TW", "B00AEBB99Q", "6304806450", "B00005U5A8", "6305428441", "B00005JL72", "B00005JKCB", "B000QUCQX8", "B00007BK2Q", "B000TLOMPE", "B00AMSM9AO", "B000085EFK", "0783237367", "B0045HCJG2", "B00005U5A9", "B00AEFXUFS", "B00008977B", "B00AEFXP3U", "B000053VBC", "B003NH6FY2", "B0041QSZS8", "B0014BQR7Y", "B000U1ZV8K", "B00000JGHV", "B0028ZDJF8", "B0000TWMWA", "B00D24CUXG", "B00006RCOC", "B000RW3VCK", "0780627822", "0792838076", "B000089738", "B000K7VHTQ", "6305428409", "B000KG4BTU", "B00013WWT8", "B001AEF6C2", "B002OGMGV4", "6305505780", "1558908390", "B0012RWQJ8", "6304821832", "B0001Z37HM", "B000803BPS", "B0045HCJ5S", "B002CA68NO", "B001K98MGE", "0783235070", "B000051YMS", "B00015YVD6", "6305120013", "B0002C4JJ4", "B000BOH8X2", "B00441GYQ0", "B00AEFXBG6", "B000065U1Q", "B000A2XAQ4", "B00BTYPWDQ", "B00004Z1FX", "B0045HCJ9O", "B00000I1JZ", "B001MWUWU8", "B0000AOX0E", "0767821955", "6304779631", "B002GSXKOM", "0783226926", "B004QXJZYO", "B00008G8LY", "0783114885", "B00AEFYDM2", "0783227396", "0790731533", "B0000TWMTS", "B00027JZ3E", "B0030BOCL4", "B001B3LIOC", "B0001AW14C", "6304602944", "B000B8GT92", "B002VWNICM", "B00AEFXPMG", "B000063UR3", "B003BV8I3Q", "B002GHHHOM", "B0041QSZLA", "B00004W223", "B002GSXKPG", "B00AEBB8EM", "B00ALTQRRK", "B00003CXGG", "B000M341R8", "B000056BSD", "B0071HPOHY", "6305428115"], "bought_together": ["B00AEFXP8K", "B00AEFY6TW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005JD5H", "B00AEFXP8K", "B00AEBB99Q", "B00AEFXXMI"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 94871}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 13.88, "brand": "Paramount Home Video", "asin": "6305310351", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516BVGQS2WL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Golden Child"}
{"description": "Iranian director Abbas Kiarostami won the Palme d'Or at the 1997 Cannes Film Festival for this contemplative film about a Muslim, Mr.&nbsp;Badi (Homayon Ershadi), who drives around the barren hills outside Tehran, flagging down passersby and offering good money for a simple job that he's hesitant to explain. He's planning his suicide and seeks someone to perform something of a symbolic eulogy. Most of his subjects refuse (personal morality aside, suicide is forbidden to Muslims), but he finds an elderly taxidermist (Abdolrahman Bagheri) who agrees only because he needs the money for an ill child. Yet the old man gently pleads with him to choose life, to embrace the joys of earthly existence, to remember the taste of cherries. Though initially greeted with critical acclaim,A Taste of Cherryreceived poor distribution in the U.S. The meandering, deliberately paced drama is composed of long conversations and long silences, and the camera is locked in the car for entire sequences, staring at the protagonists in still closeups with the dusty landscape rolling past the windows of the Land Rover in the background. Kiarostami's film is not for everyone, but if you can embrace the quiet power and grace of his deceptively simple style, the film becomes a remarkably rich celebration of human dignity and resilience. By the astonishing conclusion we can see past Badi's age-etched face to the soul peering out from behind his sad eyes.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00031TYGW", "B00006ADES", "B003D63G5E", "B00IGK6TH4", "B00HVOFP6W", "B003E0YU04", "B0087OULO6", "B00L3ZB7JO", "B007A9EGG8", "B00HE011DE", "B00J2PQZRQ", "B000I8OOG0", "B007A9EG8G", "B0087L40DC", "B000065V3Z", "B00004VVO5", "B00EO2I6W4", "B00JVQ7QTM", "B000093NR0", "B00HVOFP62", "6305081034", "B0009WIE9I", "B000PKG6O4", "6305257450", "B00J2PQYG8", "B0018Z2IJ2", "B0026VBOJW", "B000093NQZ", "B002BWP4A6", "B00GPPXNQ2", "B00K0MM4AM", "B00GBT637S", "B00GS0919C", "B002VRNJT4", "B00005EBSF", "B00HE010QM", "B00005BHW6", "B00003CXUM", "B00005JLHW", "B00HVOFP9O", "B003ICZW7S", "B0007989Y8", "B000BB14IA", "B00009Y3OK", "B00J2PQYY0", "B000BC8SWE", "B002U6DVQ2", "B000E5LEV0", "6305744114", "B007A9EGB8", "B000VARC32", "B0002DB52M", "B00IGK6TGU", "B00151QYE4", "B00092ZLEY", "B00F98FOI6", "B00005NFZD", "B003WKL6Y4", "B009VO9XSG", "B00GBT629C", "B00007L4I8", "B009RWRIMA", "B00GPPXNEE", "B00HE01030", "B00BX49C3S", "B005152C7S", "B003ICZW78", "B00DZP1C3Q", "B00IGK6TOM", "B006TTC5A4", "B00GBT62N8", "B00H9HZGQ0", "B00GMV8B1G", "B000093NR2", "B003MRVJZI", "B000GG4Y32", "B00HVOFP12", "B00CQ8HCSM", "B005HK13P4", "B0000DZ3DW", "B001CW7ZT4", "B003N2CVOK", "B00HY8PXPI", "B00004Z1FM", "B005ND87L8", "B005HK13T0", "B0006Z2NAO", "B0009PW3RE", "B004CIIXDM", "B000C8Q900", "B005KQVE1S", "B0047P5FT0", "B00005M2C7", "B00J2PQZEY", "B00005NFZB", "B003D3Y64C", "B000065V38", "B00HE010LC", "B002IVDLH8", "0780021134"], "bought_together": ["B00K2OC05M", "B00031TYGW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003D63G5E", "B00006ADES", "B00031TYGW", "B002VRNJT4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 167861}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 20.73, "brand": "ERSHADI,HOMAYON", "asin": "6305362688", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51dbJ08g4AL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Taste of Cherry (The Criterion Collection)"}
{"description": "This 1997 film from Norway and neophyte director Erik Skjoldbj&aelig;rg  delivers the goods with unsettling effectiveness. It's an intense, smart,  and taut thriller if only because what it eerily implies is creepier than the  film's reality. Opening with a churning, chilling murder of a young woman,Insomniainvites the viewer--as well as its protagonist, celebrated Oslo  homicide cop Jonas Engstr&ouml;m (Stellan Skarsg&aring;rd)--into the mind and  thoughts of a killer by making Engstr&ouml;m fatally flawed himself. While in pursuit of  the murderer, Engstr&ouml;m makes a mistake; he accidentally shoots his partner and  friend and covers up his deed in a panic. But he overlooks a minor detail:  the real killer has seen him commit the crime. What ensues is a layered,  complex, and unnerving descent into chaos, brought on by the inability to  sleep in this land of the midnight sun. Engstr&ouml;m suffers from insomnia,  which  warps his logic and resolve, and before long he's totally unraveled and  unsure of his every move. But not before a twisty transference and  countertransference occurs between cop and killer. The two play a game of  high-stakes one-upmanship that surprises in the end.Insomniais fresh and  psychologically bent, full of Scandinavian despair and dark humor, and it  boasts a film noir pulse beneath its blinding light.--Paula  Nechak", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005NFZC", "B00006FMCS", "B003LR5BD0", "B00JH4SZWK", "B00JPUUSEE", "B0081HLM2E", "B00000F3CD", "B00GBT62PQ", "B000BB14IA", "B004XVMCH6", "B00HE010QM", "B004N1JGI4", "B001CW7ZSA", "0780022343", "B004ALIG4M", "B005J47Q90", "B00JAQJNN0", "B00K6D1R0I", "B00004W3HG", "B00HT2RTU6", "B003KGBISE", "B004NWPY3E", "B00180R06I", "B00005BHW6", "B001CW7ZSU", "B00000CQJZ", "B00HVOFP6W", "B00005EBSF", "B00000C0QO", "B00005JL57", "B001EOQCJE", "B00HRJVHOU", "B00GPPXNEE", "B00HE01030", "B0000A02TX", "B004ALIG1U", "B0009298N4", "B002IVDLH8", "B00GPPXP6A", "0783228457", "B004WPYO7E", "B00J81S92S", "B000BR6QIW", "B00005A8TX", "B000093NQZ", "B001PYD0KM", "B00000F7E6", "0792838947", "B005152C9G", "B00FXOO2A2", "B001WLMOL4", "B003ELMR9E", "0780021541", "B00B2BYXSG", "B00AQ6J536", "B0002KPHZG", "B003TTBA0S", "B0007GAG42", "B004P2VQZ2", "B0009OUBC4", "6305228876", "B00005QAPH", "B000087EY5", "B00B2BYXTK", "B00005B1ZL", "B001BEK8E2", "B007N5YJWK", "B00005NC66", "B000I8OOG0", "B00JJ3EHCG", "B005KQVE1S", "B001BSBBJE", "B00HE011DE", "B001MYIXAC", "B004NWPY20", "B00005JMVQ", "B00004W3HF", "0780023099", "B000H5U5RG", "B00DZP1C9K", "B0057GYODG", "B00HVOFP9O", "B0009X75EC", "B002BWP4A6", "0780023277", "B00CUKTHES", "B00JQYV0B4", "B000KRNGOA", "B00F98FOFY", "B000305ZYS", "078062856X", "B000OPPAF6", "B001PYD0M0", "B00KE3B7BE", "B0047P5FU4", "B002E01MBA", "B00E18QKJ2", "B00JBGSHSQ", "B00005QAPI", "B006TTC5MM"], "bought_together": ["B00005NFZC", "B00006FMCS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005K3NY", "B00JJ3EHCG", "B00J2PQYYK", "B00J5JSV3A"]}, "price": 22.32, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 40121}, "asin": "6305389519", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/310DKGT5SAL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Insomnia (The Criterion Collection)"}

{"description": "Sean Connery plays a master thief thought to be long retired, while Catherine Zeta-Jones is his foil, a hotshot insurance investigator assigned to his case. They both have a little something to hold over each other's heads, until it turns out that Zeta-Jones is a professional art thief herself and is playing on both sides of the fence. At first they eye each other with mutual distrust until they team up for a job, which goes off without a hitch. Inevitably their prickly relationship begins to thaw somewhat, and the two become attracted to each other as they plan out the massive Y2K bank scam that is the movie's climax (complete with sequel-ready ending).Entrapmentplays somewhat like a '70s caper movie revamped for the gadget-happy high-tech '90s. The plot takes a few too many labored twists and turns, and the chemistry between the two leads is nearly nonexistent, though both carry on gamely in their parts. On the other hand, there is some genuine suspense in many scenes as they go about their business, dripping with whiz-bang burglary devices. Zeta-Jones, of course, is drop-dead gorgeous, and Connery is as reliable as always in his role. The fairly flat editing and direction tends to drag the film down somewhat, but fans of caper movies, high-tech thrillers, and the two leads should find plenty to like in this film.--Jerry Renshaw", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00006IUNT", "6304925131", "079212569X", "0792133153", "0792116887", "B0000048TX", "6303696813", "0790731975", "6303313345", "6304258984", "0783223218", "0800125762", "B00004WIDB", "B00000IO4G", "0783216084", "6303020089", "0790748169", "6300183211"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 212089}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6305622825", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/7179VDAPNGL._SY300_.gif", "title": "Entrapment [VHS]"}

{"description": "Set in the early years of the Tokugawa Shogunate, the samurai adventureSword for Truthis a nonstop bloodbath: characters are beheaded, disemboweled, dismembered, stabbed, impaled, and otherwise dispatched amid fountains of blood. The violence is so repetitious, it soon loses its shock value. The icy Shuranosuke Sakaki wears the \"Blades of Death\" on his kimono--with good reason. Apparently aronin(a masterless samurai), he's hired by the Nakura clan to rescue the kidnapped Princess Mayu from the Seki Ninja, who are demanding the antique Ginryu Sword as a ransom. Shuranosuke fights a succession of warriors, akappa(a water demon in Japanese folklore) and the damned soul of a Seki Ninja, slaughtering them all effortlessly.The story makes no sense. The viewer never learns why the Seki or the rival Himiko Ninja desire the Ginryu Sword. An extended sequence depicting lesbian sex and opium use never pays off; neither does the duel between noble Kazuma Utsuki and a paid assassin. But the minimal plot is only there to connect the sword fights. When Utsuki comments, \"The scent of death is in the air,\" he's not kidding. For hard-core fans of anime swordplay and violence only.Unrated, but graphic depictions of violence, violence against women, sexual encounters, drug use, and drinking are unsuitable for children.--Charles Solomon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00000IBUG", "B000056MMA", "B009AVC922", "B00004YZGB", "B0000APVFZ", "B00004Z4WG", "B001808CWE", "B00005V1XW", "B00009MGFR", "B00AUJH32E", "B0009IW8FS", "B00AX0LKXS", "B000031EG6", "B00005NG6U", "1586640038", "B00003UCAV", "B008NNY9YE", "6304493681", "B00BQ1DDUG", "B000FILUL0", "B0007939U2", "6305262322", "B00CBDG50S", "B000E5LF0K", "B00A830748", "B00000JL4L", "B007S9XXFA", "6305062528", "B00C3JU7UO", "B00000I1SE", "B0000C2IV8", "B000087F31", "B00ENNA62W", "B0000541S4", "B00005AX6M", "B00007KK3I", "B000OCZ9ZU", "B00005B1VN", "B000R17RS0", "6305293651", "B0000687EZ", "B00007K014", "B00000JL4M", "B00005BCKE", "B00005A06C", "B00008K777", "B001OMZYEK", "B000093NPS", "B00005LP44", "B00007M5JH", "B000MGBSQ2", "B000H0MKHY", "B00008MHAO", "B000R17RT4", "B000FS2VYK", "B0001Y4LFU", "B00147OXSS", "B00142G99Y", "B003TTZTEG", "B000056MW6", "B0000C52G2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B009AVC922", "B00005V1XW", "B00009MGFR", "B0007939U2"]}, "price": 10.72, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 166000}, "asin": "6305951667", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/512XASWGRDL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Sword for Truth"}

{"description": "Don Sharp's moody if workmanlike horror film suffers from the absence of Christopher Lee, whose intense, almost feral presence inThe Horror of Draculamade him one of the most memorable bloodsuckers in film history. In his place is a veritable undead cabal led by the vampire patriarch Ravna (Noel Willman), a nobleman whose family literally holds a tiny Eastern European village hostage. When a young honeymooning couple wanders into this terror-gripped crossroads, Ravna decides to make the innocent bride his own, and the dizzy groom can only turn to the dark eyed, wild-bearded Prof. Zimmer (Clifford Evans) for help. It's an unusual chapter in the vampire legend, as these undead are more like a cult interested in adding to their numbers, complete with formal ceremonies. Sharp creates a thick cloud of dread from the empty streets, the mourning peasants, and the fog that seems to carpet the doomed town every night, but has less success with his cast. Only Zimmer emerges as a memorable figure, an almost  demonic-looking vampire hunter who comes off as a shadowy alter ego of Van  Helsing. Christopher Lee returned in Hammer's next vampire picture,Dracula, Prince of Darkness.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000AUHOK", "B00005OSJW", "B00B94VJYW", "B008BWFOXM", "B007ZFSBWW", "B00005KHJP", "B00005NSXY", "B0009X770O", "B0001FVE9K", "B00009PY48", "B0002KQNJU", "B000TUDBGG", "B00005NKTH", "B00456VHMA", "B000U1ZV7G", "B000062XEY", "B0000A9GHP", "B000RXVNCY", "B000RXVNDI", "B0000694WH", "B001B9ZVVC", "B0001FVE68", "B00CLIAACC", "B001B1Q3LM", "B0014BQR24", "B00B1RINAK", "B00009NHC0", "B00000F62P", "B009H3LOX8", "B00AEBB8VK", "B0000694WM", "B0000AINPF", "B00008973G", "B000ATQYWY", "B000TGJ89E", "B00579FVRG", "B000060MVD", "B00009VU01", "B00DZP1C9K", "B000MV8ZDQ", "B00009NHAB", "B00008J2EM", "6305650667", "B00IARA8HU", "B0006L0LHK", "6300185443", "B002C17RTW", "B000W22234", "B00005IAQD", "B000B7QCTU", "6305650594", "B008I5OHXU", "B00005KHJQ", "B000SSONQ6", "B005OK0YQG", "B0000633TB", "B000EBGF86"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0009X770O", "B00B94VJYW", "B00B1RINAK", "B000095J42"]}, "price": 23.07, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 142573}, "asin": "B00000AEW0", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/512N4WEBS2L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Kiss of the Vampire"}

{"description": "There's no rule against rock anthems from the 1970s in the soundtrack for a movie about a medieval jousting champion, but if you're going to attempt such jarring anachronisms, you'd better establish acceptable ground rules. Writer-director Brian Helgeland does precisely that inA Knight's Taleand pulls off this trick with such giddy aplomb that you can't help but play along. (Upon witnessing a crowd of peasants at a jousting match, singing and clapping to the beat of Queen's \"We Will Rock You,\" you're either going to love this movie or dismiss it altogether.) Other vintage rock hits will follow, but Helgeland--the Oscar&#xAE;-winning cowriter ofL.A. Confidential--handles this ploy with judicious goodwill, in what is an otherwise honest period piece about a peasant named William (Heath Ledger) who rises by grit and determination to the hallowed status of knighthood.As if the soundtrack weren't audacious enough, Helgeland (recovering from the sour experience of his directorial debut,Payback) casts none other than Geoffrey Chaucer (wonderfully played by Paul Bettany) as William's cohort and match announcer, along with William's pals Roland (Mark Addy) and Wat (Alan Tudyk), and feisty blacksmith Kate (Laura Fraser). Of course there must be a fair maiden, and she is Jocelyn (newcomer Shannyn Sossamon), with whom William falls in love while battling the nefarious Count Adhemar (Rufus Sewell) on the European jousting circuit. Add to this an inspiring father-son reunion, Ledger's undeniable charisma, a perfect supporting cast, and enough joyful energy to rejuvenate the film's formulaic plot, andA Knight's Talebecomes that most pleasant of movie surprises--an unlikely winner that rises up, like its hero, to exceed all expectations.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000EDWKXI", "0800141601", "B00447L4KA", "B00006ZXSK", "B004SEUIWY", "B002VWNID6", "B00004XPPG", "B00003CXC3", "B00005EBIL", "B000ARXF96", "B00AEFXKUI", "B004SUDQ40", "B001HN69AY", "B004SIP9U6", "0792839137", "B0002YLCG0", "B003UYUQZW", "B003FCKIGQ", "B000056VP4", "B002NZK5V4", "B00005JLO2", "B002O3Z50Q", "B002O3Z4XY", "B00AEFY5B6", "B000GGSMO4", "6305428077", "B00003CXG7", "B00004WG2F", "B00005JN0T", "B0010V4VJY", "B005ORVN00", "B00000JQB5", "6305428042", "6305123454", "0783225814", "B00AEBB9UU", "6305692688", "B0000WN0SW", "B000MGUZCU", "B00006ADFM", "B00005JKCH", "B00AMEZDJW", "B0000TPA0G", "B0000844I8", "B002GHHHHO", "0783240295", "B000K7VHQ4", "B00000K3UU", "B00005JKMN", "B000EPFCPE", "B0006GAI5U", "B0007IO6NM", "B002K0WBXW", "0767821513", "B00005QJJG", "B00008EYA5", "B00004Z4WR", "B00005JKNV", "B00005LOL0", "B004SIP6BI", "B00003CXHJ", "B002NXSRVG", "B002ZG999U", "B004SEUJ9Q", "0783233477", "B000T5O47Q", "B00F84H73Q", "B003U0AHBO", "B00004W4UD", "B00AEFXYOA", "B000AARKOO", "B00AEFZ6V4", "B00005JM5B", "B0001HLVS2", "6305428387", "B002GHHHME", "B000LC55F2", "B00AEBB8R4", "B007SPPANM", "B001GZ6QC4", "B00BLN4V46", "B000EGDB10", "0800195175", "B000FKO5QK", "B000U7WV1Y", "B00BTYSIWI", "B0038N9X3Q", "6305609764", "B000K4WPCC", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B00011CZRE", "B00005JMOW", "0800141741", "B00005JPD0", "B001DDBD4K", "B00008G7UF", "B000209KMW", "1558908382", "B004LWZWGA", "B0009RCPUW"], "bought_together": ["B00447L4KA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0800141601", "B00447L4KA", "B00003CXC3"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 7604}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.99, "brand": "Columbia Telecommunications", "asin": "B00000F4ZY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51rNtZ4oMwL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "A Knight's Tale (Special Edition)"}

{"description": "Hidden throughoutCach&#xE9;is the sense that you should be watching every moment in this film closely, just as the protagonists are themselves being watched by someone unknown. Georges and Anne Laurent&#x92;s (Daniel Auteuil and Juliette Binoche) enviable lives are terrorized by the sudden arrival on their doorstep of a videotaped recording of their Parisian townhouse. It&#x92;s nothing but a long, unedited shot of the fa&#xE7;ade of their house, but it&#x92;s disturbing nonetheless. Soon another arrives, this time of the farmhouse Georges grew up in, and then another of a car driving down a suburban street, and a walk down a hallway to a low-rent apartment. Again the videos are benign but unsettling. Then the mystery becomes more threatening when they receive gruesome postcards depicting child-like drawings of bloody, dead stick figures. Georges believes he knows who the culprit is, but for reasons all his own  refuses to let his wife in on the secret. Clearly more is hidden here than just the identity of their stalker. InCach&#xE9;, writer and director Michael Haneke skillfully, methodically pulls back multiple layers of deception, like new skin being pulled off an old wound. he masterfully fuses elements of his predecessors to create a film that is haunting and memorable. There is Bergman's fascination with the complexity of relationships, the suspense and lurking danger of Hitchcock, and the unique cinematic sensibility of Antonioni. In fact, the provocative final shot is practically a tribute toThe Passenger--a lot of people will want to rewatch it many times to see what they can find in it (if, after watching it, you are still unsatisfied with the resolution, then watch the interview with Haneke in the DVD's special features for his insights). It's a film of great effect and intrigue. There are no easy resolutions, and the answers given in this mystery will only lead to more questions.--Daniel Vancini", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002BWP4A6", "B00006LPER", "B000SIWHAK", "B00386OWUC", "B00187FPC2", "B00062134E", "B000068MAL", "6305228876", "B0002DB52M", "B00AIBZLHS", "B002BWP3UC", "B000OVLBGC", "B000B9EYFW", "B002AG2NTI", "B0057GYODG", "B00005N89H", "B0036TGSJE", "B000G0O5IM", "B000MTEFP0", "B00092ZLEY", "B0012QE4PI", "B0019UGYAU", "B00005N8A9", "B00023P4N8", "B0007Z0NYQ", "B0001EFUFK", "B000EHQU3A", "B002VKB0M4", "B00151QYE4", "B00005JKJA", "B000N4SHOO", "B00HVOFP6W", "B00AIBZLR8", "B005KQVE1S", "B00K0MM4AM", "B004WPYO7E", "B00HE011DE", "B006KH6CF4", "B000N3T0DW", "B00008976W", "B0007OCG5G", "B000059HA5", "B000083C5F", "B00GPPXNQ2", "B00018D40O", "B002VECLXC", "B00AX7PGQS", "B003VA3JTA", "B00005QAPJ", "B00005OSLQ", "B003Y5H4R0", "B00HT2RTU6", "6305744114", "B00005K9O8", "B00429MM1K", "B002P7UCJK", "080215056X", "B000E5LEV0", "B00009W0U4", "B000EHQU30", "B000BRBA8S", "B00JJ3EHCG", "B00IGK6TH4", "B00005JLQW", "B0007GAG42", "B00000K3TS", "B00K72HVBC", "B00005NFZC", "B000HIVIQU", "B000N6TX1I", "B000OCY7JE", "B007A9EGG8", "B001CIOCLC", "B00AEBB89W", "B000N2HBIO", "B00CQ8HCSM", "B000EQ5V2C", "B000E6EGT6", "B000934FC2", "B0087IT8FK", "B002BWP3UM", "B0006Z2NCM", "B00GRA7M2G", "B00ATK015K", "6305999872", "B001AZJKKK", "B000GBEWNY", "B000GBEWPC", "B00F6SHGF8", "B00008976Y", "B000FVQM2Y", "B00H4IR3JC", "B004ODLUIU", "B0006IUE9I", "B004YCKKH8", "B00455JE58", "B002ZG4Q66", "B0081HLM2E", "B00AEFXN9G", "B0024FAG2Q"], "bought_together": ["B002BWP4A6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002BWP4A6", "B00187FPC2", "B0036TGSJE", "B00006LPER"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 17815}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.28, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B00000F7E6", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41CS99VVAKL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Cache (Hidden)"}

Yet another entry in the horror subgenre of giant animals running amok,Lake Placidfeatures a giant crocodile that has somehow found its way to an isolated lake in Maine. The absurdity of crocodiles in Maine sets the tone for the entire movie, which has no ambitions beyond mixing a little fright with a little humor. Bridget Fonda (Point of No Return,Jackie Brown) plays a paleontologist sent to investigate a large tooth; Bill Pullman (Independence Day,Lost Highway) is a fish and game warden just trying to keep the peace; Oliver Platt (Funny Bones,Flatliners) plays a loose-cannon mythology professor who swims with crocodiles for sport; and Brendan Gleeson (an excellent but little-known actor, most noted forThe General) is a local sheriff with a short temper and a big gun. Add a few gruesome dismemberments, Betty White as a cantankerous old broad who may have murdered her husband, and a cow hanging from a helicopter, and there you have it:Lake Placid.

Tolkien's classicThe Lord of the Rings,  but this robust adaptation maintains reverent allegiance to Tolkien's creation,  instantly qualifying as one of the greatest fantasy films ever made. At 178  minutes, it's long enough to establish the myriad inhabitants of Middle-earth,  the legendary Rings of Power, and the fellowship of hobbits, elves, dwarves, and  humans--led by the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and the brave hobbit Frodo  (Elijah Wood)--who must battle terrifying forces of evil on their perilous  journey to destroy the One Ring in the land of Mordor. Superbly paced, the film  is both epic and intimate, offering astonishing special effects and production  design while emphasizing the emotional intensity of Frodo's adventure. Ending on  a perfect note of heroic loyalty and rich anticipation, this wondrous fantasy  continues inThe Two Towers(2002).--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JKZV", "B00005JKZY", "B00BEZTMFY", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B005COPWZW", "B00005JM5E", "B002ZG980U", "B002PMV9FG", "B001GZ6QC4", "B007K3JFUQ", "B000U7WV1Y", "B00005JNJV", "B001OQCV6A", "B004M1A21K", "B008UZ7MYY", "B00HFFE8HE", "B000A9QKLO", "B000E8M0VA", "B000W7F5SS", "B0014C2FX8", "0618640150", "B001DHXT20", "B00E5I2M6I", "B00003CX5P", "B0013FDM7E", "B00AZMFJYA", "B00005QZWI", "B0019L770A", "B000I0RQVI", "B002IPFWTE", "B001CDR1FG", "B0006UEVT0", "B003TT2X6S", "B001OQCV2E", "B009JBWOU0", "B00005JL78", "B00005JNOG", "B001UV4XHY", "B00CNW9ZI6", "B00GKOJ98E", "0345325818", "B0014Z4ON4", "B000H30B2C", "B005LXQLRW", "B001UV4XIS", "B001GCUO1Q", "B00CZDLGDU", "0345538374", "B004LWZW42", "B007REV4T8", "B000W746GK", "B00005JPH2", "B003TT2X72", "B004LWZWGA", "B0087ZG7J8", "B005G4TJUC", "B003ZK99NQ", "B00006HBUJ", "B008UZA8FY", "B0090SI56Y", "B000VI70QS", "B00005JNC2", "B004WCTLNY", "B0014Z4OMU", "6305313687", "B004AKCME8", "B000E6EK2Y", "0547928211", "B000LC55F2", "B0002KVUKM", "B000FQJAIW", "B008JFUO72", "B000FIMG68", "B005LAIHSG", "B005LAIIT4", "B004AOECXI", "B00029RTCG", "B000P0J0EM", "B002HWRYJE", "B0060FXDCG", "B001ECQ75A", "0792839749", "B00AEFXZJE", "B005LAII0I", "B0042U94UQ", "B001HN6918", "B00008G8M5", "B008JFURII", "B003ZKBELG", "B000P0J09W", "B003XURDAY", "B00335EQ0E", "B00008G8M4", "0547928203", "B000W796OM", "B00006ADD5", "B00J49R1BY", "B00B04NIZO", "B00G5G7EXY", "B00001ZWUS"], "bought_together": ["B00005JKZV", "B00005JKZY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00HFFE8HE", "B00005JKZY", "B00BEZTMFY", "B00005JKZV"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 3641}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.49, "brand": "NEW Line Home Video", "asin": "B00003CWT6", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Dj%2BQ1hLBL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)"}

{"description": "Hong Kongwuxiafilms, or martial arts fantasies, traditionally squeeze poor acting, slapstick humor, and silly story lines between elaborate fight scenes in which characters can literally fly.Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragonhas no shortage of breathtaking battles, but it also has the dramatic soul of a Greek tragedy and the sweep of an epic romance. This is the work of director Ang Lee, who fell in love with movies while watchingwuxiafilms as a youngster and madeCrouching Tigeras a tribute to the form. To elevate the genre above its B-movie roots and broaden its appeal, Lee did two important things. First, he assembled an all-star lineup of talent, joining the famous Asian actors Chow Yun-fat and Michelle Yeoh with the striking, charismatic newcomer Zhang Ziyi. Behind the scenes, Lee called upon cinematographer Peter Pau (The Killer,The Bride with White Hair) and legendary fight choreographer Yuen Wo-ping, best known outside Asia for his work onThe Matrix. Second, in adapting the story from a Chinese pulp-fiction novel written by Wang Du Lu, Lee focused not on the pursuit of a legendary sword known as \"The Green Destiny,\" but instead on the struggles of his female leads against social obligation. In his hands, the requisite fight scenes become another means of expressing the individual spirits of his characters and their conflicts with society and each other.The filming required an immense effort from all involved. Chow and Yeoh had to learn to speak Mandarin, which Lee insisted on using instead of Cantonese to achieve a more classic, lyrical feel. The astonishing battles between Jen (Zhang) and Yu Shu Lien (Yeoh) on the rooftops and Jen and Li Mu Bai (Chow) atop the branches of bamboo trees required weeks of excruciating wire and harness work (which in turn required meticulous \"digital wire removal\"). But the result is a seamless blend of action, romance, and social commentary in a populist film that, like its young star Zhang, soars with balletic grace and dignity.--Eugene Wei", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0007QS27K"], "also_viewed": ["B0007Q6VXC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 367958}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 0.95, "brand": "", "asin": "B00003CXR3", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51G39T50SDL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]"}
{"description": "To callPearl Harbora throwback to old-time war movies is something of an understatement. Director Michael Bay's epic take on the bombing that brought the United States into World War II hijacks every war movie situation and clich&#xE9; (some affectionate, some stale) you've ever seen and gives them a shiny, glossy spin until the whole movie practically gleams. Planes glisten, water sparkles, trees beckon--and Bay's re-creation of the bombing itself, a 30-minute sequence that's tightly choreographed and amazingly photographed, sets the action movie bar up quite a few notches. And in updating the classic war film, Bay and screenwriter Randall Wallace (Braveheart) use that old plot standby, the love triangle--this time, it's between two pilots (Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett) and a nurse (Kate Beckinsale) who find themselves stationed at Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, during what they thought would be a nice, sunny tour of duty. Then, of course, history intervened.For the first 90 minutes of the movie, Affleck and Beckinsale find a nice, appealing chemistry that plays on his strengths as a movie star and hers as a serious actress--he gives her glamour, she gives him smarts. Their truncated romance--the beginning of which is told in flashback so we can get right to the point where he has to leave her to go to England--works, thanks to their charm. They're no Kate and Leo fromTitanic(a strategy the film strives hard toward), but they're pretty darn adorable in their own right. Hartnett, as the not entirely unwelcome third wheel, squints bravely but makes only a slight dent in the film. Everyone else inPearl Harbor--from Cuba Gooding Jr.'s brave navy seaman to Jon Voight's able impersonation of FDR--is pretty much a glorified walk-on, taking a backseat to the pyrotechnics and action sequences that keep the three-hour film in fairly constant motion. But when that action does take hold,Pearl Harboris quite a thrilling ride.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792151712", "B000059HGY", "B00000K3AN", "B00AEBBA36", "0792133153", "079212569X", "6305169187", "6301734734", "0792147618", "0792116887", "6304618344", "079213690X", "6303269834", "6304925131", "6305718792", "6304259131", "B00004WIDB", "6304935811", "6303057225", "6304143184", "6302250269"], "bought_together": ["B00000K3AN", "B00AEBBA36"], "also_viewed": ["B00000G3PA", "0792151712", "6300213668", "B00000JS61", "6303215734", "6303402348", "B00004WIDB", "079213690X", "6305750750", "B004751DFU", "B00005O893", "B00000K3AN", "6301792734", "B00E5I2MCM", "6305169187", "B00007LVCM", "B007SPPANM", "B00L4K3MLE", "B00FLML7HW", "B008QZ5PY2", "B00JBGWP3Y"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 234413}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.49, "brand": "", "asin": "B00003CXTF", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HC1ZDJN6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]"}
{"description": "If you want to laugh and enjoy yourself, I recommend Bring It On. With a superb cast, catchy lines, and a fully developed plot, this movie is great! Kirsten Dunst stars as Torrance Shipman, the ditzy but loveable high school senior who is newly elected team captain of her high school cheerleading team. But when a replacement cheerleader, Missy Pantone, walks in to the Toros' cheerleading squad (hilariously portrayed by Eliza Dushku), she shows Torrance that the team's cheers are ripped off from the East Compton Clovers, and you can believe that the Clovers are fed up with the stealing. Torrance, horrified that her cheerleading career has been a fake, makes an effort to be original, but the result is a humiliating performance at a competition. Torrance is comforted by love interest Cliff Pantone (played by hottie Jesse Bradford), Missy's REALLY cute twin brother, and a romance begins. As the movie leads up to the UCA Nationals competition, the Clovers and Toros fight for the win. Who will it be? Well you better watch it for yourself. Bring It On is a refreshing change from the immature sick sex movies and it instead is fresh, bright, witty, and very funny.

{"description": "Rereleased on video 30 years after its initial release, this classic Disney movie about a motherless cougar looks great, if not quite perfect.  Originally  filmed in 1967 in the Cascade Mountains of the Pacific Northwest,  the scenery and wildlife are absolutely spectacular. The story is somewhat formulaic, but entertaining just the same. A forester named Jess adopts an  abandoned cougar he names Charlie, nursing him from an eyedropper and enduring many sleepless nights in the process. As Charlie grows, he's a  fixture in the local logging community, where mischief abounds and laughs  are plentiful. When Charlie enters his teenage years, his natural  curiosity and playfulness begin to hinder the logging process, and Jess is  forced to release his beloved friend. Highlights include several comic  chase scenes between Charlie and a terrier named Chainsaw, an amazing logrolling  sequence in which Charlie shows off some fancy footwork, and a  toboggan ride that Charlie and his viewers will remember for a long time. All in all, this 75-minute adventure-comedy is perfect for the whole family.

{"description": "The self-proclaimed People's Champion, a wrestling character who's  struck gold by essentially being a good guy who just can't help but act like a heel, is celebrated in this DVD that packages some of the Rock's notable matches with an enormous helping of his legendary verbal abuse. The Rock's rise to prominence in the World Wrestling Foundation is shown by the inclusion  of showdowns with the Undertaker and the Big Show. The Rock's oddly comical  pairing with Mick Foley as \"the Rock and Sock\" connection is also given a fair  amount of screen time.  Segments show him at home in Miami (where as Dwayne  Johnson he played for the University of Miami football team), visiting his  favorite barbershop (where he claims he learned some of his signature catch phrases), and shopping for his trademark flashy shirts at his favorite stores.  He is also seen making a number of personal appearances, from book signings to throwing out the first pitch at a major league baseball game.  If this sounds like the production is light on actual wrestling content, it is, but those who can't get enough of the hottest character in wrestling will find plenty of opportunity to \"smell what the Rock is cookin'.\"--Robert J.

{"description": "This complete, live, television concert, recorded for the long-running  German pop music series Musikladen, captures the Cars in their late '70s  ascendancy, offering ample evidence of the young Boston quintet's rock-solid  performing skills and formidable instincts as writers and arrangers. Poised  between arena-rock bombast and punk aggression, the Cars were canny, concise  stylists who proudly unleashed hit singles in an album-dominated era, an  achievement that could mislead serious-minded rock aesthetes to assume the band  was a studio invention. In fact, their major-label deal arose only after the  band had honed its playing in Beantown clubs and cracked local airwaves with  self-produced prototypes of the songs that popped up on theirself-titled debut album.The 11 songs here tilt toward that collection, with a nod to itssequel, and all share the band's  shrewd synthesis of tightly crafted songs that explore a tension between  romantic yearning and neurotic anxiety. Principal songwriter Ric Ocasek swaps  vocal leads with bassist Ben Orr, establishing their familiar yin and yang, with  Ocasek mining neurosis while Orr plucks the heartstrings. David Robinson's  muscular, uncluttered drumming transcends its frequent use of electronic drums,  Greg Hawkes's keyboards deftly stretch the sci-fi possibilities of then- primitive synths, and not-so-secret weapon Elliot Easton, a southpaw guitarist,  tightens the clockwork interplay between his versatile lead guitar and Ocasek's  crisp rhythm work. If the band's choral work sounds thinner than on their  recordings, it's less an indictment of the band than a measurement of how far  producer Roy Thomas Baker carried the heavily layered vocal stamp he had refined  with the Cars' labelmates, Queen.The original program source confines the audio to a monaural mix, and the video  transfer suffers from some intermittent raster patterns. Such artifacts are  minor handicaps given the caliber of the performance.--Sam Sutherland", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000H5U5VM", "B004S7G6C2", "B000003474", "B003097ABA", "B000G1R4P2", "0399163700", "B00005QBZD", "B004NTMNB8", "B000F8O49A", "B000002GWX", "B000002GWB", "B00000IL66", "B008B3MZMY", "B000021Y7X", "B000000OY7", "B00ILAWJLO", "B000002GXD", "B000002H1T", "B00002ND7R", "B00005R23S", "B0002MGY5G", "0809252570", "630463949X", "B0002IQI2Y", "B00167632A", "B005V4X8TK", "B003C1SPX8", "B00001ODGR", "B000FP2ZQC", "B000WUK1T8", "B00005NFZQ", "B0003035CW", "B0002Z9HT8", "B000654YRY", "B0082SIPXQ", "B008NR92SI", "B000BTC5LW", "B000VS6QTK", "B00005TQ47", "B000WQW988", "B0017F65AG", "B00E5N8DGG", "B000067D3K", "B0018M6J72", "B0018AK9NO", "B007JZFX42", "B00005Y1XY", "B0012YYZYK", "B00JKJ101K", "B000000OX9", "B0059Y7TRE", "B000I5XD06", "B0050JN7Z6", "B005V4X8UO", "B009KNKMEM", "B00008PX8P", "B0050JN8BE", "6305538433", "B000LW7Z4G", "B00006L923", "B000641Z90", "B008OIV1FI", "B00092ZMDY", "B0007Y89ZM", "B000AOJ9EE", "B00DZP1C9K", "B00IXHBL7I", "B00005Y7MY", "B0023R323A", "B001S29PGE", "B00006672I", "B00004RETA", "B000008J2X", "B0007TKGQC", "B0001XPT4I"], "bought_together": ["B000H5U5VM", "B004S7G6C2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000H5U5VM", "B000002GWB", "B000002GWX", "B003097ABA"]}, "price": 49.95, "categories": [["CDs & Vinyl", "Alternative Rock", "New Wave & Post-Punk", "New Wave"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Rock"], ["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 204050}, "asin": "B00004YS4O", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41oaL7KbUzL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Cars Live - Musikladen 1979"}
{"description": "\"It is hard to imagine a more beautiful movie\" (Time) than this critically acclaimed chronicle of hippie life during the late 1960s, which garnered the acclaimed director of Bonnie and Clyde his second Oscar(r) nomination*. Based on the song by folk music troubadour Arlo Guthrie, son of legendary \"Dust Bowl\" balladeer Woody Guthrie, this tribute film to \"the lost generation\" features memorable scenes with other folk artists like Pete Seeger, who join Arlo in song to make a profound statement about war, protest and change.  In the late '60s, a changing social and political climate inspired a new generation to create a lifestyle outside of the mainstream. Twenty-two year-old Arlo's journey to find a place for himself and his music includes a visit to his dying father in the hospital, gigs in New York and romps with his friends Alice and Ray, who run a small restaurant in Stockbridge, Massachusetts.

{"description": "An Official Selection at both the Cannes and New York Film Festivals, Raoul Ruiz's Time Regained performs the remarkable feat of bringing the work of Marcel Proust to the screen. With brilliant execution, Time Regained realizes the mixture of space and time, of image and memory, which flows throughout Proust's multi-volume \"Remembrance of Things Past.\" Aided by an outstanding cast of international film stars, including Catherine Deneuve, John Malkovich, Emmanuelle Beart, and Vincent Perez, Ruiz has made a glowing reverie on a passing age that both overwhelms and entertains.Time Regained (the title of Marcel Proust's last volume) opens in 1922, as Proust is on his deathbed, looking through photos and remembering his life. Gradually, we watch as his own experiences give way to the characters in his novel -- fiction eclipses reality. Ruiz, with incredible visual dexterity, shows how the author's creations combine with his own experiences, like slides projected on to the wall of his room. Memories of the idyllic days of the lost paradise that was Proust's childhood alternate with rich recollections of his life in fin de siecle Parisian society. The drama of the Great War, examined in the context of spectacular soirees and grand parties, becomes in Ruiz's hands an elaborate comedy of manners.  In Time Regained, Ruiz discovers the impossible--the intangible timelessness that was the object of Proust's novels, blending both the baroque and the surreal. The result is a montage of moving snapshots and feverish dreams that makes the film the ultimate in Proustian cinema, succeeding magnificently where other adaptations of his work have failed. Enriched by stellar performances, Time Regained is a \"gorgeous, meticulously crafted spectacle\" (Jack Matthews, NY Daily News) that is presented here for the first time, in letterboxed format.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00020VZUW", "0500238545", "0307472329", "B005STGM1O", "B0081U25IG", "1590170598", "B000WZAE7W", "0812969642", "0679779159", "1590515668", "158988079X", "B0058M6UNG", "0393321800", "B001HUSNWO", "0143114980", "0375753117", "B00EV1YZKK", "030018543X", "B0007KTAZE", "0803226616", "0375753125", "0786704543", "B00HRJVHEK", "B00AIBZLHS", "B007P470R0", "0143039229", "B0009P7EI2", "0142437964", "0375752331", "B00IAR2CFG", "B00EO2I6XS", "1608195821", "0374534144", "0143039318", "0671207857", "1590516125", "B0009S2KJM", "B004H83IHS", "B00ARX2VZW", "B000YAA68W", "B00009V2IP", "B0011ETNXY", "B002L5NYMS", "B000I8OOG0", "6305132917", "0231114915", "B0001NJZ70", "B002M2T1V8", "B000267776", "0195389352", "B00AQN7QYY", "0393049140", "B0013NAMLK", "B00007J5VT", "B0002KQNKE", "6305811555", "0792846109", "B00B2BYXSQ", "0143106902", "B009TT0BSE", "B00000AG7M", "B00005JKGX", "0143039075", "B0001BMLUA", "B00005Q2YS", "B002ZGW9E2", "B000062XI7", "B0070YPWAW", "B000GIXLUC", "0300108125", "1561635227", "0415584329", "0521734320", "B00DQN6IOK", "B000FMGTSK", "B000GTJSEY", "0394174143", "1885586450", "0394720962", "B00007K6J7", "0521275881", "B000SIWHB4", "6302041228", "B000J4OYNG", "B000XT0MUQ", "B002X84R10", "1585676489", "B000056OCM", "B000FBHCC8"], "bought_together": ["0500238545"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0500238545", "B00020VZUW", "0375753125", "B0000DZ3DS"]}, "price": 17.96, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 103478}, "asin": "B0000584ZF", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51BBPWDCVYL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Time Regained"}
{"description": "The saga of Hitomi, the psychic girl from Earth on the world of Gaea, reaches new heights of byzantine complexity as she, Allen, and Van are captured by Dornkirk, the Zaibach Emperor--who is actually Sir Isaac Newton. Dornkirk plans to create a machine that will enable him to create alternate destinies for Gaea. The trio escapes to the Kingdom of Asturia in the mobile suit Escaflowne, which is somehow linked to the destiny machine. Folken plots to break the tie between Hitomi and Escaflowne by creating a romance between her and Allen (whom Princess Millerna loves). Things grow even more bizarre when Folken replaces the blood of his feline servants, Naria and Eriya, with artificial \"fortune blood\" that increases luck. He attacks Asturia to seize Hitomi with a cadre of super-lucky soldiers during Millerna's wedding to Dryden. Hitomi believes she altered the destinies of her friends by giving Millerna a false Tarot reading that led her to go through with the wedding. The mixture of slushy romance, amplified luck, and artificial destiny takes some very odd turns, especially when Hitomi decides she misses Amano, her boyfriend on Earth, whom she hasn't mentioned since the first episodes.

{"description": "Hollywood's loss was Europe's gain when Jules Dassin fled America because of the House Un-American Activities Committee blacklist at the end of the 1940s. His films helped bring the moral ambiguity of the postwar American thriller to Europe, inspiring a new generation of critics and filmmakers. Writing several years before he madeThe 400 Blows, Fran&ccedil;ois Truffaut praised Dassin for the way his films \"combin[ed] the documentary approach with lyricism,\" a method that would inform many of the new wave films of the '60s.Rififi, shot on the rainy streets of Paris, is imbued with the same gritty realism that marked Dassin's earlier work in New York (The Naked City) and London (Night and the City). Jean Servais plays Tony le St&eacute;phanois, an aging crook whose thin lips and tired, seen-it-all eyes give him a look somewhere between Humphrey Bogart and Harry Dean Stanton. Out of jail after a five-year stretch, he joins up with a couple of pals to pull one last heist: a jewel robbery that is portrayed in such detail (including tips on how to silence an alarm using a fire extinguisher) that the film was banned in several countries.The robbery sequence alone, which lasts for 30 minutes and is played entirely without dialogue, would be enough to ensureRififi's classic status, but there's a lot more to enjoy, including terrific performances from Marie Sabouret as Tony's world-weary ex-girlfriend, and from Dassin himself as a dandified Italian safecracker with an eye for the ladies. After the thrill of the heist, in the film's final scenes when, with the inevitability of the bestfilms noirseverything falls apart, Dassin achieves the lyricism that Truffaut admired so much. By combining the conventions of a caper movie with his own brand of bleak nihilism, he madeRififiinto a film that deserves to be counted among the best ever made.--Simon Leake", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000M2E3GI", "B0006Z2NE0", "B000AQKUG8", "B00012L786", "B001CW7ZSU", "B0006Z2NDQ", "B004NWPY3E", "B000MTEFOQ", "B0000BUZKP", "B000AQKUH2", "B00005AUK9", "B005152C9G", "B001CW7ZSA", "B000NOK0HG", "B000E5LEVA", "B00007ELDG", "B00023P4GA", "B0016B6ZEC", "B00AQ6J5YA", "B000PKG6OE", "6305999872", "B0006HC0I2", "B000244EWO", "0792838947", "B00005PJ6Y", "B005HK13S6", "B004C2523M", "B00005AUKD", "B000B8384Q", "B00007CVS2", "B00004W229", "B00AQ6J6H6", "B00005RDRL", "B00005NFZA", "B00007CVS3", "B00023P4II", "B0087ZG7OI", "B000244EWY", "B001CC7PM6", "B0024FAG8A", "B009X919UE", "B003ZYU3U0", "B000KJTGFG", "B000EXDSBQ", "B00005BCJZ", "B000025RE7", "B00AQ6J64O", "B009D004TA", "B000087F79", "B00005NC66", "B00004W19C", "B001LMU1C8", "B00E18QKJ2", "B0007ZEO8C", "B002U6DVQ2", "B004WPYO7E", "B000E5LEV0", "B00097DY2A", "B00192QJQC", "B0007989ZC", "B0000633SC", "B000244EYW", "B000BB14IA", "B002IVDLH8", "B00005QAPH", "B001BEK8E2", "B00009ME9Z", "B000244F2S", "B001D8W7EK", "B0024FAG80", "0780022343", "B0007989Y8", "B000B83846", "B0000CNY4M", "6305081034", "B00GPPXNEE", "B005152CB4", "B00I116MZ2", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B00DBE97S8", "B001TIQT6G", "B00C3ALM02", "B0007ZEO7S", "B00GPPXNIK", "B000BC8SWO", "B00DZP1BUU", "B00CVB6XF2", "B0024FAG6W", "B001LMAK6A", "B0006UEVVS", "B00004XPPK", "B0002V7O0Q", "B00CUKTHES", "B000244EZ6", "B008CJ0JS4", "B003UM8T3U", "B00BGARG3C", "B000244EX8", "B0001UZZS6", "B0012Z363A"], "bought_together": ["B000M2E3GI", "B0006Z2NE0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0792838947", "B0007UC8Y4", "B001QOGYBI", "B00HRJVHEK"]}, "price": 27.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 35656}, "asin": "B00005A8TX", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41SfwdPH7AL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Rififi (The Criterion Collection)"}
{"description": "When Sarah (Neve Campbell) strikes up a conversation with a sad-eyed man called Alex (William H. Macy) at her therapist's office, she asks, \"Are you one of those middle-aged guys who's tired of his marriage and thinking maybe a beautiful young thing could help him out?\" She's right, but the source of Alex's depression is far from typical: he's a second-generation hit man who wants out, but his mom and dad won't let him quit.Donald Sutherland makes Alex's laconic and utterly monstrous father the most frightening parent since John Huston inChinatown. A series of flashbacks show how he introduced Alex to his trade, beginning with shooting squirrels in the woods. We never find out whether Alex's father has mob connections, and the fact that it's just a business to him (\"This one's a big job, lots of moola, I'll buy your mother a Lexus\") makes him all the more chilling. Alex's mother (the steely Barbara Bain) knows all about the family business, but his wife (Tracey Ullman) thinks he runs a mail-order company, and the only person he confides in is a therapist (John Ritter). When he meets and falls for Sarah, Alex realizes that he alone can stand up to his father, and he needs to act before his own son becomes the next apprentice.Henry Bromell's debut film as a writer-director probes the same dark corners of the middle-aged male psyche asAmerican BeautyandThe Sopranos. Alex's tormented life is a symbol of the damage that parents can inflict on their children, and Bromell imbues his story with a tragic inevitability.Panicreceived a shamefully limited theatrical release, in spite of its rare combination of a great script and brilliant performances.

{"description": "It's a good thing Sandra Bullock knows her strengths and weaknesses, because without Bullock as star and producer,Miss Congenialitywould be an insufferable mess as opposed to being a mildly enjoyable trifle that is custom-made for Bullock's established screen persona. Only Bullock's fans could really appreciate this fluff (even then they'll wish its ripe premise had been more intelligently handled), but it's not without some highlights to accompany Bullock's reliable charms. Here she plays clumsy, nerdy FBI agent Gracie Hart, who is given the horrific pseudonym Gracie Lou Freebush (one example of the movie's juvenile tendencies) when assigned to infiltrate a beauty pageant to investigate threats of a terrorist attack.Transforming Bullock from frumpy to stunning is a piece of cake (although she gives pageant coach Michael Caine a run for his money), so the movie's premise is trivial at best. More enjoyable is her character's uncouth disdain for pageant contestants and her mistaken perception that they're all a bunch of bimbos. The movie nicely charts Gracie's realization that her own pageant makeover provides a much-needed ego boost. In addition to Caine's effortless scene-stealing, pageant host William Shatner and organizer Candice Bergen are smart choices for comedic support (Shatner's a perfect Bert Parks wannabe), but the movie desperately needs a credible foundation for its comedy to really pay off. Bullock's bureau boss (Benjamin Bratt) is an unconvincing dimwit, and none of the plotting is as smart as sayBeverly Hills Copin combining procedure with laughs. That leaves Bullock to carry the burden of a comedy that just barely works in her favor.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0009KA2OA", "B00005O5CM", "B00005JM55", "6304765266", "B002K0WBXW", "B00081U7HC", "B00AEFXO8Q", "B00003CXSM", "B00006ZXSL", "B00008NRI7", "B002VECM6S", "B00007E2F5", "B0006GANOQ", "B00AEBB8NS", "B00003CXMP", "B0000524E5", "B00AEFY99O", "B00006FMUW", "B000HEWEE4", "B002NZK5V4", "B000YDBPAM", "B000QQLVPQ", "B00AEBB8R4", "B000CEV3M8", "B002O3Z50G", "B004SEUJK0", "B000J4QW7W", "B00E8RKHWW", "B002O3Z4ZW", "B00AEFYM2S", "B000209KMW", "B00AEFY4CG", "B00006ZXSK", "B0045HCJJ4", "B00447L4KA", "B00AMEZDJW", "B00008WJD6", "B0000897EG", "B000QUU4LY", "B000MQC9H4", "B00AEFXYOA", "B0000DIXDR", "B000XT1P3E", "0800177258", "0783225504", "B000NA1WE0", "6305236569", "B000023VTP", "B000FO0A9W", "B002SYAGNC", "B001ECDVK4", "B00003CXFV", "B00AEFYF2K", "B000J103OI", "B00005JG6N", "B0036TGSIK", "B00466HN7M", "B00000G3PA", "B0000AOV4I", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00AEFY5TI", "B0015I2RT8", "B001ECDVJU", "B004SIP8JI", "B00005KAQP", "B000ELJAEM", "B0049TC88U", "B002NZK5UU", "B00006ZXSQ", "B00008G8M4", "B004SIP9RO", "6305212112", "B000A343RI", "B004SIP9X8", "0783225733", "6302077818", "B002GHHHP6", "B002GIBVWA", "B00AEBB9WI", "0800141806", "B000683VI4", "B00795C5X4", "B002NZK5RS", "B00003CXTA", "B000JYW5BE", "B00005JM9Q", "B004EPZ070", "B00AEFXZJE", "B003L20IHE", "B007L6VMDK", "B0038N9X3Q", "B00386EZKE", "B000CCBCAI", "B00007BKVC", "0783235070", "B00AEFXWXI", "B000CEV3KU", "B00005BCKF", "B00AEBB8YW", "B0006N2EZ0"], "bought_together": ["B00005O5CM"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000NA1WE0", "B003PIUIJC", "6304765266", "B00005O5CM"]}, "price": 9.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 77252}, "asin": "B00005AAA9", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514V9KPFJRL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Miss Congeniality"}

{"description": "Gosford Parkfinds director Robert Altman in sumptuously fine form indeed. From the opening shots, as the camera peers through the trees at an opulent English country estate, Altman exploits the 1930s period setting and whodunit formula of the film expertly. Aristocrats gather together for a weekend shooting party with their dutiful servants in tow, and the upstairs/downstairs division of the classes is perfectly tailored to Altman's method (as employed inNashvilleandShort Cuts) of overlapping bits of dialogue and numerous subplots in order to betray underlying motives and the sins that propel them. Greed, vengeance, snobbery, and lust stir comic unrest as the near dizzying effect of brisk script turns is allayed by perhaps Altman's strongest ensemble to date. First and foremost, Maggie Smith is marvelous as Constance, a dependent countess with a quip for every occasion; Michael Gambon, as the ill-fated host, Sir William McCordle, is one of the most palpably salacious characters ever on screen; Kristin Scott Thomas is perfectly cold yet sexy as Lady Sylvia, Sir William's wife; and Helen Mirren, Emily Watson, and Clive Owen are equally memorable as key characters from the bustling servants' quarters below.Gosford Parkmanages to be fabulously entertaining while exposing human shortcomings, compromises, and our endless need for confession.--Fionn Meade", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000BITVAG", "B007A2O3FO", "B00003CXC9", "B005S9EJ14", "B0000CE684", "B00AZMFO6I", "B0080QOL10", "630560097X", "B000LPS34E", "B000E8JNQU", "B004ALIG2O", "B00005UNCB", "B004JMSIQS", "6305692696", "B00F1BFRA6", "B002TZS58I", "B0002DRDY6", "B004SIP7D0", "B000E0ODZE", "B0001US78G", "B004XVMCMQ", "B004XYOQU4", "1557045313", "B005SYZYYK", "B000F3UAFC", "B000063K2Q", "B00003CX8N", "B0009GX1CE", "B001KP2J3U", "B0006Z2NAY", "B008NNY8TK", "B00062IZ0Y", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B005CFBZX4", "B004U7MQZ6", "B0001I55M4", "B00005O7N8", "0788815490", "B00GSBMNOQ", "B003UESJH4", "B0001DCYUU", "B0000797E7", "B008RO6PJQ", "B0013K2ZGI", "B000ETRCN0", "B00005OBAL", "B0009PVZM8", "6305918880", "B0080QOKYS", "B00HUAH14Q", "B00009IB1D", "B000A8AXXG", "B00GWXI16O", "B00C888OFA", "B00GAXASLC", "1250020360", "B000N4SHOE", "B004H0ZHD4", "B0099Y2MYK", "B009B1EPQ4", "B001CW7ZT4", "1573629723", "B009T6CXG0", "B001GJ4U5A", "B004SIP98S", "B00G15MDI0", "B00B62R9XM", "B004SIP9U6", "B0080QOL1A", "B000069HZU", "B004N66XYE", "B004XVMCKS", "1250047900", "B004499LWG", "B00AY2DL78", "6305428557", "B00A1EOC22", "B00D49YEHO", "B00BTYJYR6", "B0001US61O", "B0006Q9482", "B007701RFS", "B0073U2EWM", "B00F98FOI6", "B000092T3P", "B000CCW2O8", "B000065V3V", "B004HHX9H8", "B00HYZ0ZLS", "B00JFH8GZA", "B003DUBAXK", "B00AEFYO5I", "B00005U2KC", "B004SIP7F8", "B00GAHJO8G", "B00005RDRO", "B00DW5IKWK", "B00D3PYQT0", "B00005JOA0"], "bought_together": ["B000BITVAG", "B005S9EJ14"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AZMFO6I", "B000BITVAG", "630560097X", "B00005UNCB"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 7477}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 10.27, "brand": "Universal Studios", "asin": "B00005JKNF", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51oleUlbquL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Gosford Park - Collector's Edition"}

{"description": "WithThe Return of the King, the greatest fantasy epic in film history draws to a grand and glorious conclusion. Director Peter Jackson's awe-inspiring adaptation of the Tolkien classicThe Lord of the Ringscould never fully satisfy those who remain exclusively loyal to Tolkien's expansive literature, but as a showcase for physical and technical craftsmanship it is unsurpassed in pure scale and ambition, setting milestone after cinematic milestone as the brave yet charmingly innocent Hobbit Frodo (Elijah Wood) continues his mission to Mordor, where he is destined to destroy the soul-corrupting One Ring of Power in the molten lava of Mount Doom. While the heir to the kingdom of Men, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), endures the massive battle at Minas Tirith with the allegiance of the elf Legolas (Orlando Bloom), dwarf Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) and the great wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen), Frodo and stalwart companion Samwise Gamgee (Sean Astin) must survive the schizoid deceptions of Gollum, who remains utterly convincing as a hybrid of performance (by Andy Serkis) and subtly nuanced computer animation.Jackson and cowriters Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens have much ground to cover; that they do so with intense pacing and epic sweep is impressive enough, but by investing greater depth and consequence in the actions of fellow Hobbits Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd), they ensure thatReturn of the Kingmaintains the trilogy's emphasis on intimate fellowship. While several major characters appear only briefly, and one (Christopher Lee's evil wizard, Saruman) relegated entirely to the extended version on DVD, Jackson is to be commended for his editorial acumen; like Legolas the archer, his aim as a filmmaker is consistently true, and he remains faithful to Tolkien's overall vision. IfReturnsuffers from too many endings, as some critic suggested, it's only because the epic's conclusion is so loyally inclusive of the actors--most notably Astin--who gave it such strength to begin with. By ending theLOTRtrilogy with noble integrity and faith in the power of imaginative storytelling,The Return of the King, like its predecessors, will stand as an adventure for the ages.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JKZV", "B00003CWT6", "B00BEZTMFY", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B002ZG980U", "B002PMV9FG", "B008UZA8FY", "B001NGML48", "B00005JM5E", "B001GZ6QC4", "B005COPWZW", "B008M4C1EO", "B00HFFE8HE", "039548930X", "B000W7F5SS", "B000I0RQVI", "B002VWNIDG", "B000E6EK2Y", "B001BYMX4A", "B004M1A21K", "B007K3JFUQ", "B001DHXT20", "B001UV4XHY", "0345325818", "B003Y5H54W", "B00005JNJV", "B00E5I2M6I", "B000A3XY5A", "B004LWZWGA", "B000U7WV1Y", "B005LXQLRW", "B001OQCV6A", "B000E8M0VA", "B004SIP8ZM", "B000EHRVMY", "0618640150", "B003ZK99NQ", "B0013FDM7E", "B00005JPH2", "B000UNYK4E", "B009JBWOU0", "B00003CX5P", "B00008G8M5", "B00GKOJ98E", "B004LWZW42", "B000H30B2C", "B000P0J0C4", "B00CZDLGDU", "B000M341QE", "B00008G8M4", "B000FKO5QK", "B00HWWUQYY", "B007SPPANM", "B008JFUO72", "B001DJLD1M", "0345538374", "B00AEFY5B6", "B00005JKCH", "B004SIP9U6", "B000YGGNMO", "B00E5I2M9K", "0618126988", "B005OCFGTO", "B00E8S2JZ4", "6305313687", "B004AKCME8", "B0002KVUKM", "B000AARKOO", "B0006GAO5Y", "B000K7VHQ4", "B002ZG997C", "B00AHTYI5M", "B008JFUS0U", "B0042MEQVG", "B00275EGWY", "B00E9PMML2", "B008UZDXEW", "B004SIP7F8", "B00116GEJS", "B00003CXI1", "B003ZKBELG", "B003Y5H5EW", "B000V4UFZK", "B0007PLLBU", "B001DTPZNY", "B002O3Z50Q", "B001GCUO1Q", "B000LP6KNU", "B005G4TJUC", "B00AW0KHTM", "B002ZG97YM", "054792819X", "B00AEFXZJE", "B0000YEEGM", "B002IPFWTE", "B001ECQ75A", "B000065U1N", "B0051MKNV8", "B000W796OM", "B00J49R1BY"], "bought_together": ["B00005JKZV", "B00003CWT6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00HFFE8HE", "B00003CWT6", "B00005JKZV", "B00BEZTMFY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 1589}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.49, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00005JKZY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HS7iSFv5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)"}

{"description": "Such a simple idea--yet so fiendishly complex in the execution.24, as surely everyone knows by now, is a thriller that takes places over 24 hours, midnight to midnight, in 24 one-hour episodes (well, 45-minute episodes if you subtract the commercials). Everything takes place in real time, which means no flashbacks, no flash-forwards, no handy time-dissolves. Every strand of the plot has to be dovetailed and interlocked so things happen just when they should, in the right amount of time. Not that easy.Creator Robert Cochran and his team of writers and directors have done an impressive job of putting the jigsaw together and keeping the tension ratcheted up high, as federal agent Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland) runs around L.A. trying to stall an assassination attempt on an African American presidential candidate and rescue his wife and daughter from the clutches of the Balkan baddies. Twists, turns, revelations, and cliffhangers are tossed at us with satisfying regularity. It's not perfect: we get some hokey plot devices (instant amnesia, anybody?); the final twist makes no sense whatsoever; there are altogether too many huggy family moments; and as for Dennis Hopper's \"Serbian\" accent....Even so, this is undeniably mold-breaking TV. Sutherland, rescuing his career from the doldrums in one heroic leap, fully deserves his Golden Globe. Sets and locations are artfully deployed, and Sean Callery's score is a powerful, brooding presence. LikeMurder OneandThe Sopranos,24is one of those series that future TV thrillers will be measured against.--Philip Kemp", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00008YGRU", "B0002XVQSU", "B000B837XI", "B000ICLRKC", "B000MR8W92", "B001L5SRJE", "B002ZCY7SW", "B000NDEXKW", "B001DMVZOE", "B002ZCY7TG", "B0015QWZ8S", "B0001WHXM0", "B001QE99AQ", "B009LDD1H6", "B000VWC9YW", "B001DJLCRC", "B00BC5I6Q2", "B0075FF5QM", "B000RO6JY0", "B001934SNM", "B0015RRNMA", "B00005JOC9", "B000R9YLKY", "B003145HQY", "B00005JNOG", "B00J5LXT44", "B00KPP6R9S", "B0053O8AKU", "B000Q6GUW0", "B000YABIQ6", "B0044E9JU0", "B00HW3EXCE", "B009MF5BXK", "B00AIBZMD6", "B00BW4S8AC", "B00AEFY8ZE", "B00JL6L4UY", "B00HLTD3ZW", "B00HX0KIAM", "B008CLI4N4", "B000W91RUG", "0553397737", "B00KDK64DY", "B00AIBZMM2"], "bought_together": ["B00008YGRU", "B0002XVQSU"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0044E9JU0", "B00008YGRU", "B0002XVQSU", "B00LDCGBNE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 18292}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 19.38, "brand": "20th Century Fox", "asin": "B00005JLF2", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41PB6M8MGRL._SX300_.jpg", "title": "24: Season 1"}
{"description": "James Bond DVDs have in general been pretty loaded, butDie Another Dayraises the bar with a two-disc set featuring dynamic DTS 6.1 ES and Dolby Digital 5.1 EX sound that makes good use of the rear speakers. The first commentary track is by Pierce Brosnan and Rosamund Pike (who plays villain Miranda Frost). They weren't together at the time, so their comments are spliced into one track. Brosnan has a good time watching and is proud of the film but also doesn't take himself too seriously (\"They don't teach you this stuff at drama school: 'OK, now you're going to be electrocuted by the bad guy.'\"). Self-proclaimed \"Bond novice\" Pike also is proud of the film and says she's annoyed by people who question whether there's still a need for Bond. On the second commentary track, director Lee Tamahori and producer Michael G. Wilson chat about topics as diverse as casting, Bond lore, and product placements. For more Bond lore, don't overlook the trivia track, which offers pop-up tidbits about the filming and tips on the inside jokes.The centerpiece of the second disc is the 80-minute \"InsideDie Another Day\" documentary, which is a set of featurettes strung together. Topics include the opening surfing sequence; the scenes set in North Korea and Cuba (including Halle Berry's bikini tribute to Ursula Andress); the ice palace; post-production elements such as computer graphics, editing, and music; the car battle (finding strong ice was the key safety issue); and the passing of the \"Q\" torch from Desmond Llewellyn to John Cleese.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000NIBURQ", "B000M53GM2", "B000RPCK1U", "B000NDEXPM", "B000M53GMW", "B000RPCK1K", "B000RPCK24", "B000NIBURG", "B000M53GLS", "B000RPCK1A", "B000NIBUR6", "B000M53GN6", "B001PPLIEG", "B001R10BN2", "B00AQSN7HE", "B000RPCK0Q", "B000M53GNG", "B000NIBUS0", "B000NDEXPC", "B00004RG62", "B000M53GMC", "B007REV4T8", "B00004WEJZ", "B00005JL0I", "B009PN18R2", "B008YAPQX4", "B004BR7XLM", "B009PN3OD8", "B003QO8TOQ", "B000HRMAPE", "B000VNMMR0", "B0000BYRO7", "B00AZFECL8", "B000EGDB10", "B004EPYZUS", "B0004Z33EQ", "B00AIBZMD6", "B009A87Z6U", "B009RO9LKK", "B000SK5Z70", "B00003CXMV", "6305657947", "B00005JLYW", "B00005JN2Z", "B00023B1LC", "B005PTYP70", "B00008G8M4", "B00005JNJV", "B00000G3PA", "B000P0J06K", "B002UZCJ8Y", "B002ZG9864", "0792844068", "B00005JKIP", "0792166736", "0790732238", "B00AS1Q93S", "B003Q6D2B4", "B0002I84N0", "B000U1ZV8K", "B008JFURII", "B00JA3RVG4", "B000MZHW40", "B00026ZG10", "0790732149", "B000FKO3HG", "B000AP04FG", "B008JFUS0U", "B0001FGC1U", "B00005JMQW", "B009L6UDUG", "B00AVWIQZS", "B0013BM63O", "B00005JLRT", "B00E5I2M6I", "B001TK80C0", "B00AZMFJYA", "B0007KZQAM", "B002ZG999U", "B00BUAEYVK", "B009A87ZQU", "B000P0J06U", "B008JFUO72", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B00003CY0V", "B00E5I2MCM", "B0036TGSR6", "B003AWRMBU", "B0000BYRO9", "B008JFUNHI", "B00177YA1K", "6304696221", "B0021L8V0M", "B00006G8FD", "B000UR9T8C", "B002GNOSFM", "B003UESJFQ", "B0006L0LOS", "B000AYELVU"], "bought_together": ["B000NIBURQ", "B000M53GM2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000M53GM2", "B000RPCK1U", "B000M53GN6", "B000RPCK0Q"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 38500}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.0, "brand": "MGM", "asin": "B00005JLBE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51kgPWMuVFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Die Another Day (Widescreen Special Edition)"}
{"description": "There's only one deleted scene in this two-disc DVD set, but it's a doozy. The \"Sgt. Candy Scene\" is a must-see and, unfortunately, the best thing on the second disc. The rushed HBO documentary shows us far more flash than substance. Better is the Visual Effects Lab that goes more in-depth with four sequences, although you need to wade through a hokey interface for each segment. Making your \"own\" effects isn't that much fun; you can only choose a few effects that change in two scenes. Anyone looking to get the complicated backstory of the trilogy figured out should dig into the \"Sky Net Database\" and an intricate timeline. The two commentary tracks are worth a listen, with director Jonathan Mostow's solo track the better one. The director goes into great detail on how the little things (from lighting street scenes to tricks for destroying buildings) count.  The second track is pieced together from the actors recorded separately. Mostow appears with actress Claire Danes (doing her first commentary track) and their chemistry is enjoyable after a slow start. The other actors have less interesting things to say, including Schwarzenegger who is constantly--yet enthusiastically--selling the film.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001VLBDD0", "B00005N5S5", "B001FB55HQ", "B00005JA8B", "B00070FX5U", "B00007AJG4", "B002ZG98LO", "B000T9OP7G", "B002GHHHME", "B00005JKIP", "B002QFYJFY", "B0002J58HO", "B0000AXE8I", "B001AQO43M", "B00AKGG828", "B00026ZG10", "B0001BKAEY", "B00IZZDWKM", "B001451HXO", "B0000VCZK2", "B000056PMU", "B000BPL2FQ", "B000RW3VCK", "B0004Z33F0", "B000U1ZV8K", "B0045HCJGC", "B0004Z33EQ", "B00005JNTU", "B000HRMAPE", "B00008G8M4", "B000RRS7RE", "B00005JKYX", "B0000VD12I", "B000FC2FQA", "B00000ILDG", "B00000G3PA", "B00005JMZK", "B000MGBSE4", "B0087ZG7J8", "B0004Z33EG", "B000P0J0AQ", "B00005JMEW", "B0087ZG7NO", "B00003CXTA", "B0002CHK1S", "B000RJO56E", "B00177YA1K", "B00004STDN", "B005COLETU", "B001AK3S4Y", "B000VNMMR0", "B0000959N0", "B00005JMUA", "1558908846", "6305767866", "B001RIY4WE", "B0049IHX2C", "B000VI70QS", "B000EGDB10", "B002GSXKN8", "B00HZMZ2FE", "B0045HCJ9O", "B003QO8TOQ", "B00005JNJV", "B001451HX4", "B00I9TDMRM", "B0006GANOQ", "B00003CXSP", "6305428115", "B00016MSV2", "B00005JOC9", "B000TJBN80", "B009MO57H6", "B000O77SQS", "B0087ZG7HK", "B001OST0M6", "B005LAIHXQ", "B0002J4X1Q", "B0002V7OI8", "B0015XHP2C", "6304806434", "B000QXDED6", "B00005JL3K", "B008JFUPFI", "B003PIUINS", "0783225946", "0792839056", "B00005N7Z1", "B0006GAO6I", "B001DZOC6Y", "B00005JL78", "B001HN697M", "B00IJS2OXG", "B002NXSRVG", "B00008G8M5", "B00005JN0T", "B003XURDAY", "B000O77SRM", "B006VRRGNK", "B00F4FFO8E"], "bought_together": ["B001VLBDD0", "B00005N5S5"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001VLBDD0", "B00005N5S5", "B001FB55HQ", "B002JT6AO0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 115564}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 13.47, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00005JM0B", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5143TFPX8SL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)"}

Tess and Anna are trapped inside each other's body! But Tess's wedding is Saturday and the two must find a way to switch back -- fast!

{"description": "A broad science fiction thriller in a classic vein,Equilibriumtakes a respectable stab at aFahrenheit 451-like cautionary fable. The story finds Earth's post-World War III humankind in a state of severe emotional repression: If no one feels anything, no one will be inspired by dark passions to attack their neighbors. Writer-director Kurt Wimmer's monochromatic,Metropolis-influenced cityscape provides an excellent backdrop to the heavy-handed mission of John Preston (Christian Bale), a top cop who busts \"sense offenders\" and crushes sentimental, sensual, and artistic relics from a bygone era. Predictably, Preston becomes intrigued by his victims and that which they die to cherish; he stops taking his mandatory, mood-flattening drug and is even aroused by a doomed prisoner (Emily Watson). Wimmer's wrongheaded martial arts/dueling guns motif is sheer silliness (a battle over a puppy doesn't help), butEquilibriumshould be seen for Bale's moving performance as a man shocked back to human feeling.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00006JDVV", "B000LC55F2", "B000FS9FCG", "B0009A40ES", "B000KX0IM2", "B0007Y08QA", "B00AEFYCW8", "0767805712", "B00005JL78", "B0018O4YT0", "B001FB55HQ", "B00003CXZ4", "B00AEFXCLU", "B000FGGE68", "B000WMA6R8", "B002ZG980U", "B003XURDAY", "B00HOGBXS6", "B00005JPAR", "B000GFLKF8", "B00K2CHX9C", "B00AEFXW8I", "B000XR9L50", "B004XQO90O", "B000N6TX1I", "B000FKO5QK", "B004SIP9Z6", "B007WZTMCI", "B0007DFJ0G", "B000093FLA", "B0073U2FB2", "0783225814", "B000K7VHQ4", "B001OQCVI8", "B00011CZRE", "B000P0J0AQ", "B00000JSJC", "B0000AXE8I", "B008JFUQZ2", "B007X4ECMI", "B002ZG97CO", "B00AZMFJYA", "B008JFUO36", "B004P2VQZC", "B0000AC8LR", "B0045HCJT4", "B00J5LXT6M", "B00AEFY5B6", "B002UZCJ8Y", "B001GZ6QC4", "B00177Y9ZC", "B003UESJHO", "B000XA5K48", "B001DJLD1M", "B008JFUN50", "B005LAIHXQ", "B00K7IPFSM", "B0006IIPIK", "B005LAII8A", "B0013PSTMC", "B008JFUNHI", "B001L57ZYM", "B002QEHPQU", "B0034G4ORC", "B004SIP95G", "0767802519", "B001TOD92C", "B008JFUS0U", "B000087F6L", "B0051MKNV8", "B007WXUVHU", "B005LAIH2C", "B000R9U3B0", "B004LWZW7E", "B000MZHW40", "B00005JNJV", "B00005JPD0", "B000GGSMC6", "B0000ACOXL", "B0085A9HU6", "B009YQJ322", "B003Y5H5GK", "B009MO57H6", "B004LWZW4M", "0800195175", "B002QW7ALM", "B00005JMA8", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B001EAWMGA", "B002O3Z4WU", "B000BW7QWW", "B001GUYB08", "B00005V9HH", "B001UV4XWY", "B00A8MGIZG", "B002GSXKNI", "B00IARA8KM", "B004LWZWGA", "B00005JA8B", "B001QTXM5Y"], "bought_together": ["B000LC55F2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0007Y08QA", "B006ZL1PGG", "B000LC55F2", "B004P7CMJG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 61424}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.34, "brand": "Dimension", "asin": "B00005JLWN", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51K2WVH130L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Equilibrium"}

{"description": "Like a good dream, Sofia Coppola'sLost in Translationenvelops you with an aura of fantastic light, moody sound, head-turning love, and a feeling of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu, even though you've probably never been to this neon-fused version of Tokyo. Certainly Bob Harris has not. The 50-ish actor has signed on for big money shooting whiskey ads instead of doing something good for his career or his long-distance family. Jetlagged, helplessly lost with his Japanese-speaking director, and out of sync with the metropolis, Harris (Bill Murray, never better) befriends the married but lovelorn 25-year-old Charlotte (played with heaps of poise by 18-year-old Scarlett Johansson). Even before her photographer husband all but abandons her, she is adrift like Harris but in a total entrapment of youth. How Charlotte and Bill discover they are soul mates will be cherished for years to come. Written and directed by Coppola (The Virgin Suicides), the film is far more atmospheric than plot-driven: we whiz through Tokyo parties, karaoke bars, and odd nightlife, always ending up in the impossibly posh hotel where the two are staying. The wisps of bittersweet loneliness of Bill and Charlotte are handled smartly and romantically, but unlike modern studio films, this isn't a May-November fling film. Surely and steadily, the film ends on a much-talked-about grace note, which may burn some, yet awards film lovers who \"always had Paris\" with another cinematic destination of the heart.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305428239", "B0007UC8Y4", "B000BX8R10", "B00005JMJG", "B0000640VJ", "B0010X8NF0", "B003UESJLU", "B007L6VR12", "0767821408", "B00007AJF8", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B00DW5IKYS", "B001QOGYBI", "B000M06KJ8", "B00005JLRE", "B00000G02H", "B0006TPE4C", "B0007TKOAA", "B00AEFXESQ", "B00DYVUBYM", "B00H9HZITU", "B000Z8GZYW", "B004SEUIXS", "B00AEFXN9G", "B003CRM6PA", "B00008RH3J", "B000EQHXNW", "B0001I1K32", "B0008JIJ2O", "B001DJ7PR8", "B0007DFJ0G", "B0009PVZD2", "B000CS464G", "B00337KM2S", "B003102JDM", "0790734796", "B001P3SA8K", "B00JJ3EHCG", "B0000WN0SC", "B00003CWTI", "B00003CXZ4", "B00008975Z", "B0057ZAA6W", "B000IU37SO", "B00004RJ73", "B00AEFXGIY", "B007P9HW3M", "B005MYEQ4U", "B000K7VHQE", "B00005JNC2", "B00079Z9VO", "B000063JDE", "B0001US61O", "B0000WN15O", "B00G7QPXUI", "B0041KKYEM", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00006LPGP", "B0006H32EI", "B00005JKJA", "B00AEFYCL4", "B000KX0IOK", "B002T9H2LA", "B001TOD92C", "B004XVMCKS", "B00AEBB9CS", "B008220DGE", "0767802519", "B000069HYF", "B007D5E7C2", "B000M7XRAG", "B004U7MR14", "B003O7I6SE", "B000A7DVR2", "B005LAIIJY", "B00A81MV3U", "B000055Y0X", "B00005V9HH", "B000E33VWW", "0783225903", "B00AEFXE9U", "B000N6TX1I", "B00CIOD6HK", "B0021L8UOY", "B004SIP95G", "B000PAAJZ6", "B002ZG980U", "B007UW9WOQ", "B00GKOJ98E", "B0014D5RBE", "B00011CZRE", "B001HN699A", "B000M4RG7E", "B003ELKNH2", "0767802535", "B00121QGPY", "B004FQX5B6", "6305609764", "B0009A40ES"], "bought_together": ["B0007UC8Y4", "6305428239"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00JAQJMJ0", "B007L6VR12", "B001QOGYBI", "B0010X8NF0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 2901}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.77, "brand": "Universal Studios", "asin": "B00005JMJ4", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518vLN4%2B7KL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Lost in Translation"}

{"description": "The supplemental features ofFahrenheit 9/11offer almost an hour and a half of further manna for Michael Moore's supporters and ammunition for his critics, including appearances by two of the most memorable figures in the film, Michigan mother Lila Lipscomb and Marine corporal Abdul Henderson.  \"The Release ofFahrenheit 9/11\" (11 minutes) collects reactions to the film from celebrities, political leaders, and Quentin Tarantino and Tilda Swinton of the 2004 Cannes Film Festival jury (but no film critics).  Lipscomb gives a moving speech at the film's Washington, D.C. premiere (4 minutes), and in an 18-minute sequence, an embedded Swedish journalist recounts his experiences, accompanied by footage of U.S. soldiers raiding an Iraqi home.  This provides the context for the scene in the main film in which a soldier gets his picture taken with a bound and hooded Iraqi, which is chillingly similar to the infamous pictures from Abu Ghraib prison.  The second part of the DVD features consists of seven new or extended scenes (about 50 minutes total), including more footage of Iraq before the invasion; protesters outside Abu Ghraib and former prisoners showing their injuries; more thoughts from Cpl. Abdul Henderson; National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice trying to squirm off the hook in front of the 9/11 Commission; and President Bush going through the motions of a press appearance after he appeared before the same commission.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000UNYJXQ", "B0030Y11XS", "B00008DDVV", "B00009YXAS", "B00008K76O", "B0030Y11O2", "B0002RQ2Q2", "B001G43C1S", "B00008L3TE", "B0041KKYBA", "B00068VAOG", "B000T28C5Y", "B000ICL3KG", "B000BTH4K4", "B002FOQY7M", "B0002OXVBO", "B001NMT8R0", "B001MFNB5I", "B001MVWFAO", "0743272927", "B000FBH3W2", "B0007DBJM8", "B000UYX4N6", "B0027BOL4G", "B000U6YJMO", "B00G0PXU2Y", "B00005JPXA", "B000GYHRHO", "B002EP8TQG", "B000C3L2IO", "B000JVSUSE", "B004EPYZDA", "B0016N52IK", "B001BEK8FQ", "B0041KKYBK", "B00KY6YAO2", "B00F12IRSO", "B00DYC648S", "B001F5274G", "B0001L3LUE", "B000HWXOT0", "B005FITIGO", "B003CJXJ8Q", "B0013D8LHM", "B00DPUB5LK", "044653224X", "B005KBJC0I", "B004FQX59I", "B00KUS5YGC", "B007KAUWO2", "B00GYG8BKK", "B000093NQZ", "B001P9G3HE", "B00483VQTE", "B003Q6D28C", "B001B7CNW4", "B000BBOUHM", "B00744WZ8U", "B00066VTBW", "B001KWB0L0", "B00443YDWK", "B000059TG8", "B000JLTRIQ", "B003JUINFM", "0060392452", "B000I5Y8FU", "B000BITURA", "B003XKNGLY", "B004EPYZDK", "B003M987AG", "B000PY52IG", "B006ML50QK", "B000QGE89W", "B00EK52XQK", "B00DENQEE6", "B000GH3CR0", "B0047UJBP4", "B00005J75F", "0446693790", "B0006N2DSI", "B001AEF6HM", "B00005JLYW", "B001J66JQI", "B000O0YV7O", "B002NPCJRC", "B00AZMFG48", "B0042KZJIC", "B00827OX5Q", "B0002HDXTQ", "B001E5FYS8", "B00AEBB89C", "B003H23KSM", "B000CEXEWA", "0615602223", "B006JN86VW", "B00914YLAG", "B0001IXT36", "B008PUI1GM", "B004SIP7ZS"], "bought_together": ["B000UNYJXQ", "B0030Y11XS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000UNYJXQ", "B0030Y11XS", "B00008DDVV", "B0002OXVBO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 44430}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.0, "brand": "From HIBISCUS EXPRESS, http://www.amazon.com/shops/AXD9LOVGJXES3", "asin": "B00005JNEI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51KDRVF1JGL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Fahrenheit 9/11"}

{"description": "The simple pleasure of watching a living car squirt oil in a villain's face just never goes away. Disney, in their effort to revitalize theHerbiefranchise, has made the wise choice of not trying too hard--aside from a small bit of skateboarding action, just about every element ofHerbie: Fully Loadedwould fit right into the 1963 original (groovily titledThe Love Bug) or its various sequels. Maggie Peyton (Lindsay Lohan, the fiery-tressed starlet ofMean GirlsandFreaky Friday) wants to join her family's dynasty of race car drivers, but her father (Michael Keaton,Batman Returns) worries that she'll get hurt. Instead, as a college graduation gift, he buys her a junked-out Volkswagen Beetle--which turns out to be Herbie, a car with a mind of its own. Soon Maggie and Herbie are racing against an arrogant racing champion (Matt Dillon,Crash,There's Something About Mary) and duking it out with monster trucks, eventually hoping her father's heart will change.Herbie: Fully Loadedis formulaic fluff, but executed with cheerful enthusiasm; everyone involved has clearly embraced the mix of slapstick hijinks and light family drama. There's even a handful of cameos by NASCAR drivers. The result is every bit as ridiculous yet entertaining as its forebears.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B008H6GHEM", "B00005JMCW", "B00GGG60II", "B0007LXPBI", "B0000DZTMA", "B000096IAH", "B0007LXPBS", "B00005JN0Z", "B0000DZTM7", "B0000DZTMY", "B000FKP3XY", "B0009JE57G", "B000065V42", "B000BJ7BCK", "B00005JM9Q", "B008H6GH9W", "B0001I563M", "B008H6GHLU", "6305870179", "B003B1X85O", "B00437IEI6", "B00H9U7QA6", "B008H6GHG0", "B000B2YR92", "B0009X75QU", "B000YGGNMO", "B0001EFTH4", "0792839749", "B000055ZJP", "B00BI6SRVY", "B000JFY05W", "B0009DWL8W", "B001SXZ7T2", "B00AEFY8FO", "B001SXZ7TW", "B000089798", "B0001XAPVK", "B0007Z0NYG", "B004SIP75S", "B0017TWV0U", "B003PGNBNY", "B00795C5X4", "B000FCW15A", "B0006SSMWE", "B000HDRB8O", "B002BIULQ2", "B0001A79EO", "B0007US7CG", "6305320950", "B0007US7C6", "B000324Y98", "B001GC9VK6", "1558908404", "B002935GMS", "B00005NQGL", "B00005JN0Q", "B0000VCZKW", "B0012IWO0I", "B008H6GHHY", "B008H6GHJM", "B0074FUROI", "B008H6GH7Y", "B000WOSAYM", "B0024NSFYO", "B000BITUVG", "B00005JN0D", "B000089771", "B000OYCM5I", "B0019ESNGE", "B007R6DJP8", "B00022FWTA", "B00005JPO4", "B00009QG6G", "B00GOITWRE", "B00AEFYWQY", "B0001I55OW", "B000065V44", "B00005RRG7", "B005LAIISA", "B004HO6I4M", "B005F96UJ6", "B000P0J0CO", "B008H6GHM4", "B004GJYROG", "B003QP4DPY", "B001AR012O", "B0026RLMC0", "B0016Q2D5M", "B00006LPHB", "B004CYVZ4K"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B008H6GHEM", "B00005JMCW", "B000096IAH", "B00028HBES"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "asin": "B00005JNUY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514VE1AJGGL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Herbie Fully Loaded"}

There's also 13 minutes of interviews with the film's producers, and a 24-minute roundtable in which James Lipton interviews Clint Eastwood, Hilary Swank, and Morgan Freeman.

{"description": "Along withDesperate Housewives,Lostwas one of the two breakout shows in the fall of 2004. Mixing suspense and action with a sci-fi twist, it began with a thrilling pilot episode in which a jetliner traveling from Australia to Los Angeles crashes, leaving 48 survivors on an unidentified island with no sign of civilization or hope of imminent rescue. That may sound likeGilligan's IslandmeetsSurvivor, butLostkept viewers tuning in every Wednesday night--and spending the rest of the week speculating on Web sites--with some irresistible hooks (not to mention the beautiful women). First, there's a huge ensemble cast of no fewer than 14 regular characters, and each episode fills in some of the back story on one of them. There's a doctor; an Iraqi soldier; a has-been rock star; a fugitive from justice; a self-absorbed young woman and her brother; a lottery winner; a father and son; a Korean couple; a pregnant woman; and others. Second, there's a host of unanswered questions: What is the mysterious beast that lurks in the jungle? Why do polar bears and wild boars live there? Why has a woman been transmitting an SOS message in French from somewhere on the island for the last 16 years? Why do impossible wishes seem to come true? Are they really on a physical island, or somewhere else? What is the significance of the recurring set of numbers? And will Kate ever give up her bad-boy fixation and hook up with Jack?Lostdid have some hiccups during the first season. Some plot threads were left dangling for weeks, and the \"oh, it didn't really happen\" card was played too often. But the strong writing and topnotch cast kept the show a cut above most network TV. The best-known actor at the time of the show's debut was Dominic Monaghan, fresh off his stint as Merry the Hobbit in Peter Jackson'sLord of the Ringsfilms. The rest of the cast is either unknowns or \"where I have I seen that face before\" supporting players, including Matthew Fox and Evangeline Lilly, who are the closest thing to leads. Other standouts include Naveen Andrews, Terry O'Quinn (who's made a nice career out of conspiracy-themed TV shows), Josh Holloway, Jorge Garcia, Yunjin Kim, Maggie Grace, and Emilie de Ravin, but there's really not a weak link in the cast. Co-created by J.J. Abrams (Alias),Lostleft enough unanswered questions after its first season to keep viewers riveted for a second season.--David HoriuchiWhere Have I Seen These Castaways?

The episodes are presented in widescreen format, just as they were broadcast on high-definition channels. (Conventional ABC-TV broadcasts were reduced to 1.33 full-screen format.) Four of the episodes have commentary tracks by the producing team and the actors who were featured on certain episodes (Terry O'Quinn, Dominic Monaghan, and Maggie Grace and Ian Sommerhalder). The last disc has over three hours of bonus material sensibly broken into three categories. \"Departure\" discusses the initial creation of the series, the making of the pilot, and the cast (some characters were created to fit the actors, and Evangeline Lilly's Kate was the hardest to cast). It also includes the cast's audition tapes and photographs by Matthew Fox. \"Tales from the Island\" provides background material on seven of the episodes plus the boars used in filming, Jimmy Kimmel's appearance on the set, and the genesis of the Driveshaft song (\"You all everybody...\"). Finally, \"Lost Revealed\" includes two scenes cut from the season finale, 13 other deleted scenes (not identified by episode, unfortunately), a blooper reel, and the cast and crew's giddy appearance at the Museum of Television & Radio.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000FIMG68", "B000P6YNSE", "B0018CWEYY", "B0019LY5IM", "B0036EH3XE", "B000ESSSK2", "B00G4SD75W", "B000QDLSR0", "B0018CWEZ8", "B001AQMBKA", "B000FKO3GW", "B0036EH3X4", "B000TFINY6", "B001B7CNZ6", "B002N5N5MK", "B002JVWRD6", "B0024FAD9C", "0756665949", "B00129W6LE", "B000BNI90Y", "1550227432", "1550228781", "1550227998", "B000YABIQ6", "1550229516", "1550228919", "B000AJJNFE", "B0009VBTP0", "B001AQMBJQ", "B0009A407A", "B000F3UAE8", "B000RO6JY0", "B0026RHR6U", "0615508294", "B001DJLCRC", "B0001O3YLM", "B001QE99AQ", "B003R0MEYA", "B003L77GJM", "B000FIMG5Y", "B00062IDEW", "1463548702", "B0038M2APA", "B0024FAR66", "B004TJ1GY2", "B002AMVED8", "B001MVWRNO", "B000I0QLR8", "B0000Y40PW", "B0024F08RO", "B000NDEXK2", "B001C4CI8U", "B00008YGRU", "B000FFJYC0", "B000N3T0EG", "B000EWBNMI", "B004LROMSO", "B00FFSTPDU", "B001HUWQEA", "B000GETTKM", "B00IWTVDUW", "B0024FAD9W", "B003L77GTC", "B002U0KHME", "B000FVQLIO", "B000W6ZUUC", "B0049P1VHS", "B009LDD4V4", "B0075FF5QM", "B0038M2AOG", "B000FOPPBA", "B001934SNM", "B0055SNHQG", "B00D2ZF24O", "B00079FUI6", "B0053O8A46", "B004YM6JK0", "B00B5ARKC0", "B00DII0MGI", "B00005JO9J", "B002BFBB0A", "B000AJJNI6", "B000Q6GUW0", "B002GOAH1A", "B00BHLTIXQ", "B008H6GHF6", "B003L77G2Y", "B00000FBH2", "B000FIMG4U", "B005S97V82", "B00CWIMVDW", "B000Q6GUKW", "B000P6YNSO", "B001GCUER0", "B001G0MFIS", "B0001HAGQK", "B001VPJYZK", "B001VPJYZ0", "0425188809", "B000BOH986"], "bought_together": ["B000FIMG68", "B000P6YNSE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000FIMG68", "B0036EH3XE", "B0018CWEYY", "B000P6YNSE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 5709}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 16.5, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B00005JNOG", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51nb5sJm%2B3L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Lost - The Complete First Season"}
{"description": "Critics and controversy aside,The Da Vinci Codeis a verifiable blockbuster. Combine the film's huge worldwide box-office take with over 100 million copies of Dan Brown's book sold, andThe Da Vinci Codehas clearly made the leap from pop-culture hit to a certifiable franchise. The leap for any story making the move from book to big screen, however, is always more perilous. In the case ofThe Da Vinci Code, the plot is concocted of such a preposterous formula of elements that you wouldn&#x92;t envy screenwriter Akiva Goldsman, the man tasked with making this story filmable. The script followsDan Brown&#x92;s bookas closely as possible while incorporating a few needed changes, including a better ending. And if you&#x92;re like most of the world, by now you&#x92;ve read the book and know how it goes: while lecturing in Paris, noted Harvard Professor of Symbology Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) is summoned to the Louvre by French police to help decipher a bizarre series of clues left at the scene of the murder of the chief curator. Enter Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou), gifted cryptologist. Neveu and Langdon team up to solve the mystery, and from there the story is propelled across Europe, ballooning into a modern-day mini-quest for the Holy Grail, where secret societies are discovered, codes are broken, and murderous albino monks are thwarted&#x85; oh, and alternative theories about the life of Christ and the beginnings of Christianity are presented too, of course. It&#x92;s not the typical formula for a stock Hollywood thriller. In fact, taken solely as a mystery, the movie almost works--despite some gaping holes--mostly just because it keeps moving. Brown&#x92;s greatest trick was  to have the entire story take place in one day, so the action is forced to keep moving, despite some necessary pauses for exposition. As a screen couple, Hanks and Tautou are just fine together but not exactly memorable; meanwhile Sir Ian McKellen&#x92;s scenery-chewing as pivotal character Sir Leigh Teabing is just what the film needed to keep it from taking itself too seriously. The whole thing is like a good roller-coaster ride: try not to think too much about it--just sit back and enjoy the trip.--Daniel VanciniVisit The Da Vinci Code StoreOn The DVDThe DVD extras on a film as popular asThe Da Vinci Codeshould be plentiful, and this version doesn&#x92;t skimp. With over 90 minutes of special features, including ten behind-the-scenes featurettes, there&#x92;s a lot here to explore beyond the film itself. The question is, is there anything new here that we haven&#x92;t heard before, in all the hype, pseudo-documentaries, and controversy surrounding the movie, to make it worthwhile?  For most viewers, the answer will be \"yes.\" Essentially, if you like the movie, if you enjoyed the book, you will get a lot out of them.Just as the movie is intended to make the book come to life, the DVD extras should make the film come to life by pointing the audience into the world of the filmmakers, connecting the dots between print and film, and for the most part they do just that. The extras here range from the typical look behind-the-scenes to more in-depth features on the supporting characters, the locations, and theMona Lisaherself.  \"First Day on the Set with Ron Howard\" features the director gushing about the opportunity to film in the Louvre and work with Tom Hanks again (the two worked together before onSplashandApollo 13). It&#x92;s a short piece that doesn&#x92;t reveal much beyond making an attempt to share Howard&#x92;s excitement (with the \"Gee, I really loved working with him/her on this project\" that you hear in every such featurette), but viewers might enjoy seeing how the stage was set up in the famous museum, down to the spike tape on the floor showing actors where to hit their marks.The Filmmaking Experience, Parts 1 and 2further explores the creative and technical aspects of the filmmaking process.A Conversation with Dan Brownstarts out feeling like a puff-piece (the man who wrote this book got started at age 5 with a story calledThe Giraffe, The Pig, and the Pants on Fire. \"It was a thriller,\" he says.) and unfortunately it doesn&#x92;t go very deep into much of anything of interest. But on the other hand, this isn&#x92;t60 Minuteshere; it&#x92;s intended to give viewers a better sense of the man behind the franchise, which it does.  Much of the footage from this interview is sprinkled throughout some of the other featurettes. Meanwhile, the character behind the franchise, Robert Langdon, is examined in his own featurette, as is Sophie Neveu. The cool thing here is getting under the skin of the actors to see how they approached the characters, knowing that most of the movie-going public already has formed their own ideas about the characters from the book.The most interesting extras are the featurettes that focus on the history behind the mystery. Or is it the mystery behind the history?  Either way, the first one on theMona Lisa, and the second featurette on the many codes and symbols that are hidden throughout the movie balance out the remainder of the extras nicely by demonstrating the sense of intrigue, mystery, and game-playing adventure that madeThe Da Vinci Codeso popular in the first place.--Daniel VanciniBeyondThe Da Vinci CodeThe Films of Tom HanksThe Films of Ron HowardThe Da Vinci DVDs: Decoding \"The Da Vinci Code\"More About The ArtistStills fromThe Da Vinci Code(click for larger image)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002O5M4T4", "B00005JN5E", "B0013BM63O", "B002ZTQVKM", "B0007XG02W", "B001OLP2TI", "B002C68WNW", "0307474275", "B002O5M4SU", "B00005JLSB", "B000PHVZNE", "B0077ATSSQ", "B00AEFY0F2", "B000EPR7NE", "0743486226", "B001LMAK9W", "B000P0J0EW", "0385504209", "B005HWAOP2", "B001OQCV2E", "B0013XZ2QK", "B001EZE5D8", "B00005JL3T", "B000EOTW0Q", "6304711891", "B000YDBPAM", "0307950689", "B000HT386M", "B00008G8M4", "B000P0J0EM", "B002ZG99KO", "0800141806", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B00001ZWUS", "B0002V7OI8", "B002O3Z50Q", "B0006GANOQ", "B002NZK5UU", "B000NQRR1Q", "0385504225", "B004SIP7ZS", "B00005Y71F", "B000OYC7BW", "B00DL48BM6", "B00026ZG10", "B0018CWW5K", "B00004BZIY", "B0000B1OFL", "B00023B1LC", "B000N6U0E2", "B00A8MGIZG", "B00005JM5E", "B002LMV7R0", "B00004Z4WR", "B000K2UGXO", "B00005JMYC", "B001MVYUQG", "B00005JLWN", "B000056PMU", "B0000AOV4I", "B00AEFY4CG", "B00441GYXS", "B001F12J0C", "B00ES28X3C", "B002ZG980U", "B001VLBDD0", "B00008K76U", "B001TK80C0", "B008JFURII", "B000VWYJ86", "0792159659", "B00AEFYGBA", "B0009MDPYM", "B00177YA1K", "B00005N5S5", "B0043X1FM2", "B0002J58HO", "B00005JM5B", "B00AZMFJYA", "B003AWRMBA", "074349346X", "B003VA3JUO", "0783240295", "6305767866", "B0000844I8", "B000065U1N", "B002GHHHKQ", "B000K7VHQE", "B0000AXE8I", "0800177258", "B000ASDFGI", "B003Q6D2B4", "B000HRMAPE", "B000U7WV1Y", "B00005JMOW", "B00GPWEPZ8", "0312944926", "B000VI70QS", "B000KF0GWW"], "bought_together": ["B002O5M4T4", "B00005JN5E"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002O5M4T4", "B00I563DSC", "B0013BM63O", "1400079152"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 7555}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.5, "brand": "DaVinci", "asin": "B00005JOC9", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51SLBDLMtIL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Da Vinci Code (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition)"}
{"description": "Literary adaptations just don't get any better than director Joe Wright's 2005 version of Jane Austen'sPride & Prejudice. The key word here isadaptation, because Wright and gifted screenwriter Deborah Moggach have taken liberties with Austen's classic novel that purists may find objectionable, but in this exquisite film their artistic decisions are entirely justified and exceptionally well executed. It's a more rural England that we see here, circa 1790 (as opposed to Austen's early 19th century), in which Elizabeth Bennet (Keira Knightley) is one of several sisters primed for marriage, with an anxious mother (Brenda Blethyn) only too desperate to see her daughters paired off with the finest, richest husbands available. Elizabeth is strong-willed and opinionated, but her head (not to mention her pride and prejudice) lead her heart astray when she meets the wealthy Mr. Darcy (Matthew Macfadyen), whose own sense of decency and discretion (not to mentionhispride and prejudice) prevent him from expressing his mutual affection. They're clearly meant for each other, and as Knightley's performance lights up the screen (still young enough to be girlishly impertinent, yet wise beyond her 20 years), Austen's timeless romance yields yet another timeless adaptation, easily on par with the belovedBBC miniseriesthat has been embraced by millions since originally broadcast in 1995. Individual tastes will vary as to which version should be considered \"definitive,\" but with a stellar supporting cast including Judi Dench and Donald Sutherland, this impeccable production achieves its own kind of perfection.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_viewed": ["0800141660", "B00003JRCQ", "B00G6HO368", "B004SIP7AS", "B004P7CNZO", "B0053Q9DHW", "B000244FDW", "B000GRUQKQ", "B000244FFU", "B0018YCF50", "B001L57ZZG", "B004XVMCMQ", "B00AF82WTO", "B008D1RCHC", "B000Z27HLS", "B000BEZQ0Y", "0767851013", "0486284735", "B0002ZH5PQ", "B0012Q3T6I", "6303921248", "B002XTBE6K", "B001PJRAUS", "B00HYMBAQ0", "B0080QOL1A", "B00062IZ0Y", "B001C4AFOY", "B0012XIGVE", "B002KHNFFS", "B000244FF0", "B0012OVCE6", "B00HYMASS6", "B0009UZGAA", "B000784WMW", "0767020308", "B000LPQ6DE", "B001TJYFRU", "B000FTCEYQ", "B000ZS8GW6", "B005GRF2UK", "B004FM2EL2", "B00G7QPXAI", "149440477X", "B009ERK0SW", "B00006ZXSK", "B0000AUHPK", "B004UOHNCA", "0767020294", "B00094AS9U", "B000Z27HMW", "B002DY9KR0", "B000N4SHOE", "B000683VI4", "193799418X"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00G6HO368", "0800141660", "B00003JRCQ", "B005S9EK5Y"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "asin": "B00005JOHI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZGC68T2JL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Pride &amp; Prejudice"}

After a murder in the nearby woods, Owen escalates the game by concocting a hoax about a serial killer called the Wolf--a hoax that swiftly turns into reality when the not-so-imaginary Wolf sends threatening e-mails to Owen.Cry_Wolfmixes your standard slasher movie with your standard secret-twist movie to no particularly effect. The Wolf--who wears an orange ski-mask and wields a hunting knife--is a generic boogeyman; text messages just aren't scary; and all the characters combined couldn't muster up an engaging personality.

{"description": "The lurid scenario--a nymphomaniacal white trash nymphet (Christina Ricci) is held prisoner by a bitter bluesman (Samuel L. Jackson)--gives way to an affecting tale of redemption inBlack Snake Moan, writer/director Craig Brewer's follow-up to the acclaimedHustle & Flow. Lazarus (Jackson,Jungle Fever,Pulp Fiction) finds Rae (Ricci,Monster,The Ice Storm) beaten unconscious on the road in front of his backwoods house. After bringing her inside, he learns of her wanton ways and decides to exorcise his own demons by curing Rae of her sexual compulsion.Black Snake Moancould have been terrible, but Brewer takes his story seriously enough to dig into the genuine emotions of such a situation (though along the way he certainly flirts with sexploitation overtones--several scenes look like they were plucked straight out of a hitherto unknown 1970s trash classic). Ricci, Jackson, and the supporting cast (including pop star Justin Timberlake, giving a surprisingly good performance as Rae's boyfriend) treat the characters with respect, honesty, and humor.

After walking out on her teammates at the gymnastics championships two years before, the talented but rebellious Haley Graham is forced to return to the rigid world of rules, catfights, and spandex. Her in-your-face attitude quickly collides with her hard-nosed coach and teammates. But as her love of the sport resurfaces, Haley slowly earns their respect by doing what she does best -- tossing out the rules.  And in the process, she learns there are more valuable things to win in life than medals and ribbons.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0047HXMLQ", "B002TOCE9K", "B0047HXMJ8", "B000J4QW7W", "B00IBIIR4E", "B002DOBGWM", "B00AEBB8R4", "B0026BXHQ0", "B003QZSWU6", "0991816455", "B00003CXMP", "B000WC39MM", "B000ERVJHW", "B000J3OTSM", "B00F76KYSA", "B0010X5X4O", "1938438094", "B008HHB84K", "099181648X", "B00447L4KA", "B000GJ0LLI", "B003ASXMTA", "B00004XPPD", "B003NHRIVQ", "1927794005", "1423136586", "B0018CNNV2", "B0036TGSIK", "B0006SSMWE", "B0016MJ6GU", "B0007LXPBI", "B004EPZ0BG", "B0007Z9R66", "B001B7CO0K", "B001K2LFNI", "B00175VSBW", "B008JFUUIA", "B009ANP4F4", "B00AEFYM2S", "B001H1I8KK", "B004529NKC", "B000B2YR92", "B00005JLH0", "B006X08DZ0", "B003B3V0N4", "1423136322", "1423136578", "B000FUTVLY", "B0000524E5", "1414380925", "B0007US7C6", "B000GB775E", "B0009JE57G", "B000FS9MXI", "B00005JPK8", "B002VPTJOA", "B0012QCZ54", "B00AEFXSLE", "0310740673", "B0024NSFYO", "B000F6IODE", "B00466RV4M", "B0017TWV0U", "B002K0WBXW", "B00795C5X4", "B003Y5H524", "B000WC39KE", "B001GC9VK6", "B004SIP9X8", "B00HNTOYRQ", "B0039Q8X9C", "6305428425", "B0049TC88U", "B00AMEZDJW", "B004QIG7CW", "B00LG6YEKE", "B00AEFYQE2", "B000IZJZIU", "B00AEFZ3XU", "B001NE80P4", "B004ODLUIA", "B001Y8DJVE", "B00005JM9Q", "B00682LS4G", "B00003CY5P", "B0007LXPBS", "B001AV3BWM", "B002XUBDRY", "B000Y9PC7S", "B003Y5H5B0", "B000209KMW", "B003Y5H574", "B00008L3SY", "B002GOAH1U", "B0007Z9R5W", "B003TY2SWC", "0800195175", "B001OQCVI8", "B00005JLYW", "B000QXDG4S"], "bought_together": ["B002TOCE9K", "B0047HXMLQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0991816455", "B003QZSWU6", "B0000524E5", "B00IBIIR4E"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 3173}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.99, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B00005JOZC", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Oo6rlcw8L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Stick It"}
{"description": "There seems to be no end to beating-the-odds football movies these days, and if they all peak with a breathless moment of anticipation during a clutch play, thenWe Are Marshall, based on a true story, has plenty of (mostly good) company. Matthew McConaughey plays Jack Lengyel, who becomes head coach--more or less by default--of Marshall University's rebuilding varsity football team in Huntington, W. Va., after the school's 37-member team and coaches (and a number of others) die in a plane crash in the Appalachian Mountains on Nov. 14, 1970. Facing an indifferent college president (David Strathairn) ready to shut the football program down, a morose assistant coach (Matthew Fox), and a charged-up player (Anthony Mackie) who missed the doomed flight due to an injury, Lengyel is faced with fielding a new team and putting the players through their paces. There are the usual, perhaps too-familiar, training montages and field action, but screenwriter Jamie Linden and director McG (Charlie's Angels) also draw some very good performances from the likes of Kate Mara and Ian McShane, contributing to an emotional tapestry conveying a powerful sense of how such a sizable loss affects a small community.--Tom KeoghOn the DVDIntroduced by director McG, \"Legendary Coaches\" (37 minutes) has real-life coach Jack Lengyel (portrayed in the film by Matthew McConaughey) recalling his time at Marshall and reading a letter he received from President Nixon.  Then five championship coaches discuss their coaching philosophies and overcoming adversity: Bobby Bowden (Florida State football, and also portrayed in the film as the 1971 coach at West Virginia), Pat Summit (Tennessee women's basketball), Lute Olsen (Arizona men's basketball), George Horton (Cal State Fullerton baseball), and John Wooden (UCLA men's basketball).  Also included are a current promotional spot for Marshall University and the theatrical trailer.--David HoriuchiMoreWe Are MarshallBlu-rayCombo HD DVDReturn of the Thundering Herd: The Story that Inspired \"We Are Marshall\"", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000056VP4", "B000EXZFCQ", "B000J3OTT6", "B00004W221", "B002VECM6S", "B00AEFXOKO", "B0001US66Y", "0792843592", "B00005JNEW", "B00008EY60", "B001LGXIA6", "B000X5RBXG", "B000068NNU", "B000KHYN9C", "B000KF0GUO", "B009NNM9OA", "B00004TJQJ", "B004KPLVX6", "B000FVR1T2", "B001FB55NK", "B0013XZ760", "B00125WAWS", "B009YQJ2Q4", "B002O3Z4XY", "B0006FYOTC", "B004BFTFBU", "B0060ZJ7BC", "B000N6U0E2", "B00553K9IA", "B00AEFYJI0", "B000MNOX94", "B000M52WD6", "0800177258", "B00BFE33SQ", "B0068FZ0GK", "B000KLQUS0", "B000IB0DEE", "B000ARTN3I", "6305428352", "B000YAF4MA", "B00AEFY0F2", "B000Q7ZNZ4", "B000KF0GWW", "B0023UZBBI", "B0010YSD90", "B004EPYZZ8", "B002YMWQ2M", "0783225733", "B000R7G6H2", "B00005JMCN", "B002JCSWV6", "B000CNFC76", "B00005M20J", "B009POCG2C", "078324021X", "B0012YYZDG", "B002NZK5UK", "B00AEFY17E", "B000FTCLSA", "B000K2UGZM", "B000P0J0C4", "B003ASLJQI", "B00AEFZ2DG", "B00AKGG6S4", "6305428387", "B0095YMNGG", "B001REZM6K", "B004FQX5A2", "B004GXKBF6", "B000274T94", "B004GJYROG", "B001BL96JI", "B00005JMXX", "B000BFH2C8", "B00005JPLE", "B00005JLSB", "B002K0WBXW", "6304765266", "B000683VI4", "B00003CXA6", "B00002SSKG", "B004DK5CW4"], "bought_together": ["B000056VP4", "B000EXZFCQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000EXZFCQ", "B000056VP4", "B0001US66Y", "B002VECM6S"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 6665}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.85, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00005JPBO", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51tkbYp6v5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "We Are Marshall (Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "This two-disc collector's edition ofPirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chestis packed with over five hours of special features that delve into everything from creating the mythology-inspired Davy Jones and Kraken figures, to working and planning without a completed script, the incredible CGI techniques used in the film, the intense sword training sessions and stunt work, and the unpredictability of filming on location in the Caribbean. The audio commentary by writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio is an interesting and insightful look into the finished film, but perhaps even more revealing is the 25-minute \"Charting the Return\" preproduction diary in which everyone from producer Jerry Bruckheimer to associate director Peter Kohn and writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio give a sense of the enormity of the project of concurrently writing and filming two sequels toPirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl. The overwhelming logistics of planning and casting without a finished script, scouting and preparing remote locations, constructing a new Black Pearl, and functional props like the rolling water wheel, and cutting costs to stay within budget are nothing less than mind-boggling. In the hourlong \"According to Plan\" feature, director Gore Verbinski, producer Jerry Bruckheimer, and a host of others detail the enormity of the project, focusing on the stamina involved in a 200-day shooting schedule and the need for adaptability and flexibility in dealing with everything from behind schedule excavations to the logistics of shooting on moving water and even the natural fury of a full-blown hurricane.  Shorter featurettes \"Meet Davy Jones: Anatomy of a Legend\" and \"Creating the Kraken\" focus on the mythological creatures in the film and the awesome visual effects and advances in CGI technology that made them possible.  \"Mastering the Blade\" follows Orlando Bloom (Will Turner), Keira Knightley (Elizabeth Swann), and Jack Davenport (Norrington) through some intense sword-fighting training sessions and \"Fly on the Set: The Bone Cage\" offers a frightening look at what it was like to shoot the bone cage scene of the movie.  Other bonus features include bloopers, an interactive tour of Johnny Depp's special makeup effects and wardrobe details, a look at how the 1967 Disney Land Pirates of the Caribbean ride was recently \"re-imagineered\" to incorporate some of the characters and elements from the new movies, producer Jerry Bruckheimer's photo diary, and a glimpse of the glitzy June 24, 2006 red carpet premiere on Disney Land's main street.--Tami Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000U7WV1Y", "B00005JM5E", "B005COPWZW", "B004A8ZWUQ", "B0013BM63O", "B00005JN5E", "B004M1A21K", "B004DTLK80", "B000VR0570", "B00005JKZV", "B00005JKZY", "B00005JKCH", "B001HN694K", "B00005JPH2", "B00AEFYGBA", "B00BEZTMFY", "B001HQZJMU", "B00E5I2M6I", "B006VRRGNK", "B001BEK8HO", "B000E8M0VA", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B001E75QH0", "B008QE9XD2", "B00E5I2MCM", "B00LG6YEKE", "B00AEBBA72", "B007K3JFUQ", "B000HRMAPE", "B0090SI56Y", "B000E6EK2Y", "B0053FANRC", "B00005JMQW", "B008Y1YK9Y", "B00177YA1K", "B001TK80C0", "B000UR9T8C", "B00003CXI1", "B004EPYZUS", "B00003CXTA", "B001OQCV6A", "B0014Z4ON4", "B005G4TJUC", "B000F7CECK", "B00HFFE8HE", "B001GCUO1Q", "B0087ZG7J8", "B003YAR97K", "B008JFUNTG", "B001GCUO0W", "B000NIBURQ", "B0053FANPY", "B00023B1LC", "B003QO8TOQ", "B002VPE1BQ", "B00F84H73Q", "B003Y5H54W", "B00003CWT6", "B00007AJGH", "B00E5I2M9K", "B000W7F5SS", "B0049IHX2C", "B00000IRE6", "B001F7MSFM", "B000AYELVA", "B002ZG9904", "B000VWYJ86", "B00CFA222M", "B003UYUQZW", "B008UZ949K", "B0002KVUKM", "B000209KMW", "B000UVKGPI", "B0087ZG7HK", "B0000WN140", "B001EZE5BU", "B002PMV9FG", "B000HT386M", "B000NQRR1Q", "B00003CXZ1", "630529142X", "B0002ZDVEU", "B004A8ZWSS", "B00005JM5B", "B000BTITKS", "B00E5I2MEK", "B002HWRYJE", "B001GZ6QC4", "B000W796OM", "B00AQSN7HE", "B0046BI81W", "B001VLBDD0", "B0060FXDCG", "B0084IG8TM", "B005OCFGTO", "B000OLGCIE", "B008JFUS0U", "B00007AJG4", "B009JBWOU0", "B001B3LIOC"], "bought_together": ["B000U7WV1Y", "B00005JM5E"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005COPWZW", "B00005JM5E", "B0071JADFU", "B00005JPFX"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 72898}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 16.95, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B00005JP0F", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GQE7TQ72L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)"}

{"description": "One of the first things a viewer notices aboutCloverfieldis that it doesn't play by ordinary storytelling rules, making this intriguing horror film as much a novelty as an event. Told from the vertiginous point-of-view of a camcorder-wielding group of friends,Cloverfieldbegins like a primetime television soap opera about young Manhattanites coping with changes in their personal lives. Rob (Michael Stahl-David) is leaving New York to take an executive job at a company in Japan. At his goodbye party in a crowded loft, Rob&#x92;s brother Jason (Mike Vogel) hands a camcorder to best friend Hud (T.J. Miller), who proceeds to tape the proceedings over old footage of Rob&#x92;s ex-girlfriend, Beth (Odette Yustman)--images shot during happy times in that now-defunct relationship. Naturally, Beth shows up at the party with a new beau, bumming Rob out completely. Just before one's eyes glaze over from all this heartbreaking stuff (captured by Hud, who's something of a doofus, in laughably shaky camerawork), the unexpected happens: New York is suddenly under attack from a Godzilla-like monster stomping through midtown and destroying everything and everybody in sight. Rob and company hit the streets, but rather than run with other evacuees, they head toward the center of the storm so that Rob can rescue an injured Beth. There are casualties along the way, but the journey into fear is fascinating and immediate if emotionally remote--a consequence of seeing these proceedings through the singular, subjective perspective of a camcorder and of a story that intentionally leaves major questions unanswered: Who or what is this monster? Where did it come from? The lack of a backstory, and spare views of the marauding creature, are clever ways by producer J.J. Abrams and director Matt Reeves to keep an audience focused exclusively on what&#x92;s on the screen.  But it also makesCloverfieldcuriously uninvolving. Ultimately,Cloverfield, with its spectacular effects brilliantly woven into a home-video look, is a celebration of infinite possibilities in this age of accessible, digital media.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B004EPYZQ2", "B00IO9D3ZI", "B00EMMDMKM", "B002SJIO5E", "B0044ZOI32", "B001AR0D4A", "B004BZ5AMS", "B001MVYUQQ", "B003BJO8KU", "B0018AG6X6", "B005LAIGPU", "B00IO8VMB6", "B000PKG8SS", "B003Y5H5GU", "B00BPA2PGG", "B0017U7PT6", "B001YV502C", "B0013FBS20", "B008JFUR10", "B001KZVQJI", "B001CW7ZW6", "B0035WTJFW", "B000Y7U98W", "B003ABZGRI", "B000VDDWEC", "B000VDDWEM", "B002JT69IM", "B00164EAC8", "B002ZG981E", "B00AEFXORM", "B001DZOC3W", "B008SAPC20", "B003Y5H59M", "B00HERVMTK", "B00AVSFIV2", "B0032KNA4I", "B000L212HW", "B001FB55I0", "B0018O4YSQ", "B002ZG997M", "B002ZG9788", "B008G33O0G", "B000VDDWE2", "B00K2CHVSK", "B001GCUO5W", "B005J4TLQG", "B000PC6A3E", "B0027VT9ES", "B001F7MSG6", "B0051T46XM", "B00111YM60", "B001GZ6QEC", "B002HR1W1K", "B004SIPA4G", "B001OQCVII", "B001JNNDBA", "B001GKJ2FC", "B000WQWPKA", "B000OT6V00", "B0021L8UXK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004EPYZQ2", "B00IO8VMB6", "B004LWZW4W", "B005LAIHY0"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "asin": "B00005JPXY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Wm5GO98oL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Cloverfield [Theatrical Release]"}

{"description": "You know you're going to get a different kind of superhero when you cast Robert Downey Jr. in the lead role. AndIron Manis different, in welcome ways. Cleverly updated from Marvel Comics' longstanding series,Iron Manputs billionaire industrialist Tony Stark (that's Downey) in the path of some Middle Eastern terrorists; in a brilliantly paced section, Stark invents an indestructible suit that allows him to escape. If the rest of the movie never quite hits that precise rhythm again, it nevertheless offers plenty of pleasure, as the renewed Stark swears off his past as a weapons manufacturer, develops his new Iron Man suit, and puzzles both his business partner (Jeff Bridges in great form) and executive assistant (Gwyneth Paltrow). Director Jon Favreau geeks out in fun ways with the hardware, but never lets it overpower the movie, and there's always a goofy one-liner or a slapstick pratfall around to break the tension. As for Downey, he doesn't get to jitterbug around too much in his improv way, but he brings enough of his unpredictable personality to keep the thing fresh. And listen up, hardcore Marvel mavens: even if you know the Stan Lee cameo is coming, you won't be able to guess it until it's on the screen. It all builds to a splendid final scene, with a concluding line delivery by Downey that just feels absolutely right.--Robert HortonStills fromIron Man(Click for larger image)&nbsp;", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00E5I2M6I", "B008JFUO72", "B001DHXT20", "B00E5I2M9K", "B00E5I2MEK", "B0083SBMBM", "B008JFUS0U", "B001CDR1FG", "B00E5I2MAO", "B004LWZWFQ", "B001GCUO1Q", "B008JFUPFI", "B000VI70QS", "B000HEVZ9E", "B0000959N0", "B00005JKCH", "B00005JNJV", "B00005JNTU", "B0090SI56Y", "B000VR0570", "B00005JMQW", "B002HWRYJE", "B0007P0Y7C", "B004LWZW42", "B00D7OMNXS", "B001OQCV6A", "B007K3JFUQ", "B004EPZ07K", "B004LWZWGA", "B000UR9T8C", "B0083SBJXS", "B0060FXDCG", "B002IPFWTE", "B00E5I2ME0", "B00IXD2MGQ", "B000AYELVA", "B00C6B8TB8", "B008QZ5PY2", "B000OVLBF8", "B000AYELVU", "B00AZMFJYA", "B001QB9H1U", "B009JBWOU0", "B001AK3S4Y", "B001GZ6QC4", "B005G4TJUC", "B002NXSRVG", "B000HCO83Q", "B003YOZNBU", "B003Q6D2B4", "B00023B1LC", "B0002IQMAM", "B008JFURII", "B00HERGM86", "B00E5I2MDQ", "B006VRRGNK", "B002ZG99QS", "B00000JQB5", "B007REV4T8", "B00008G8M5", "B008Y1YK9Y", "B0002ZDVEU", "6305718954", "B001DTPZNY", "B005LAIGW8", "B001F7MSFM", "B001GCUNWQ", "B00A2H9P98", "B000RW3VDE", "B002O5M4T4", "B00005JA8B", "B005LAIIPS", "B005LAII44", "B00BEIYHO2", "B000GUJZ00", "B00005N5S5", "B002SJIO4A", "B000VWYJ86", "B004EPZ0BG", "B0049IHX2C", "B00AEBBAEK", "B00005JM5E", "B008JFUOWM", "B000FS9FCG", "B00005PJ6N", "B00979KQFO", "B00AEFXKUI", "B002K0WBXW", "B0042U94UQ", "B004EPYZUS", "B008JFUQZ2", "B0084IG8TM", "B001DJLD1M", "B008JFUS5A", "B00006HBUJ", "B000J103OI", "B00F84H73Q", "B0087ZG7NO", "B000U1ZV8K"], "bought_together": ["B00E5I2M6I", "B008JFUO72"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B008JFUO72", "B00E5I2M6I", "B001DHXT20", "B00E5I2MEK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 12121}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.99, "brand": "DOWNEY,ROBERT JR.", "asin": "B00005JPS8", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515wjJQt2nL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Iron Man (Ultimate 2 Disc Edition)"}

{"description": "Jean-Claude Van Damme (star ofTimecopandUniversal Soldier) plays two roles in this surprisingly good action thriller.Replicantalso stars Michael Rooker (ofHenry, Portrait of a Serial Killer,The Replacement Killers) as Jake Riley, a cop who's been tracking a serial killer called \"The Torch\" (Van Damme). Frustrated, Riley decides to retire--and the National Security Department makes him an offer: they've cloned \"The Torch\" as part of a program to track down terrorists; they'll turn this replicant (Van Damme again, of course) over to Riley as a sort of test run for the program. The idea is that the replicant will slowly recall the original person's memories and lead the cops to the original. It's ridiculous, but no more ridiculous than the setup for the highly successfulFace/Off, and it works just as well as the engine for an effective action flick. What makesReplicantmore unusual is that the writers actually put some thought into the relationship between Riley and the replicant, which starts to mirror parent-child relationships in emotionally complex ways. Furthermore, while it's no surprise that Rooker gives a solid performance, it is surprising that Van Damme does just as good a job in both of his roles--he's perfectly creepy as the serial killer and genuinely affecting as the quickly developing replicant, projecting a mixture of innocence and turmoil.Replicantwas directed by Hong Kong director Ringo Lam, the man behindFull ContactandCity on Fire. He was clearly working on a limited budget, but the movie looks good, moves with lean efficiency, and has some riveting action sequences and good quality effects--the scenes where Van Damme (inevitably!) fights himself are completely convincing.

The crumbling Italian palazzo that opens the film and the magnificent English country houses that encase the unfolding drama play, as always, an intrinsic part in the ruptured psyche of whatever gentry Merchant and Ivory have elected to pursue. In this case, divided attention is paid to erstwhile glories and turn-of-the-century ambitions. Impoverished Italian prince Amerigo (Jeremy Northam) is to marry heiress Maggie Verver (Kate Beckinsale), school friend of Charlotte (Uma Thurman), who in turn weds American industrialist and art collector Adam Verver (Nick Nolte), Maggie's father. Amerigo and Charlotte, having previously been lovers, are helpless to resist an adulterous affair. A study of life's covetous designs failing to imitate the perceived perfections of art,The Golden Bowlis likewise flawed but alluring.--Fionn Meade", "related": {"also_bought": ["B009B1EPQ4", "B000ERVJQ8", "0788815490", "B0000A02TV", "B004SUDQ8G", "B004499LWG", "B000I2J6WI", "B000F3UAFC", "B0000A02TU", "B00003CXSA", "B00003CXC9", "B0006Z2NAY", "B000065V3V", "B001D7T6D6", "B003H8F2WI", "B0001DCYUU", "B005CFBZX4", "B0001US7Q8", "B001GJ4U5A", "B00080ZH0A", "B005GRF2WS", "B00014NE62", "B000A8AXXG", "B004SIP7D0", "B0000AQS6H", "B00065GVIO", "B0080QOL10", "B00012QL14", "B00005JKNF", "B000M2E32M", "B00IKM5OTW", "0767847415", "B000E0ODZE", "B000056KMW", "B000NOIX48", "6305692696", "B00009IB1D", "630560097X", "0767020308", "B007A2O3FO", "B001DN0V02", "B009TT0BSE", "B001BNFR76", "B007WZTMCI", "B001L57ZZG", "B009T6CXG0", "B00005YUNK", "B002WY65VA", "B00I6JODGO", "B001PR0Y8K", "B000085OY1", "B0000CE684", "B00008DDRZ", "B00005V5NU", "B00009RXKB", "B000784WNQ", "B0000AQS3P", "B00014NE6C", "B00077BOHO", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B0006FO9C4", "B000T28Q00", "B00IJS2OHM", "B0002O7XVI", "B000089QEM", "B0002KPIFU", "B00HUAGZ34", "B004XYOQU4", "B00BGARGR8", "B005T0OY5S", "B00005LQ0E", "B002I5GNZQ", "B00062IZ0Y", "B000EBD9VC", "B002BEJ3BA", "B00008NNPH", "B00DL48BM6", "B008CB8CJK", "B000286S1U", "B00GS08Y3Q", "B0083HXKMC", "B00ARX2VZW", "6304696515", "B008220C38", "B000CS45TW", "B003WEAVZK", "B003VA3JTK", "B00079HZUM", "B00005JOA0", "B000051TVN", "B000GIXLUC", "B000G6BM0K", "B000065K2V", "B004D45NYC", "B001B4VXWS", "B000M2E32C", "B00AZMFO6I", "B00H4ZEFTQ", "B0001WTUJO", "B0000639G5"], "bought_together": ["B009B1EPQ4", "0788815490"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000ERVJQ8", "B009B1EPQ4", "B004499LWG", "B0001DCYUU"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 48743}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.99, "brand": "", "asin": "B00005OBAL", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51NV6HGRAML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Golden Bowl"}

{"description": "Art, publicity, and \"the politics of nudity\" go under the cultural microscope in this award-winning documentary. Photographer Spencer Tunick specializes in nudes--large groups of them, usually in public places.Naked Statesfollows Tunick from one of his many arrests in New York through a national tour in a quest to get a nude photo in each state and a gallery showing at the end of it.Naked Statescombines footage of Tunick (at times uninhibitedly whiny) at work with interviews with his subjects and the occasional wry comment by his girlfriend. Tunick's images are undeniably compelling, as are many of his subjects' reasons for stripping off and posing. Most interesting are the sequences involving a genial Burning Man crowd and some surprisingly uncooperative nudists. The film contains, obviously, quite a bit of full-frontal nudity, but none of it is eroticized--an interesting phenomenon in itself.

{"description": "The first animated work from Leiji Matsumoto, who would create the popularCaptain Harlocksaga,Star Blazers(Uchu Senkan YamatoorSpace Cruiser Yamato, 1974) was a landmark program in Japan and America. When it aired in syndication in the U.S. in 1979, the character names were anglicized (Susumu Kodai became Derek Wildstar; Admiral Okita, Captain Avatar, etc.), the violence and drinking were heavily censored, and the World War II connections of theYamatowere tactfully downplayed.The Quest for Iscandarcomprises the first 26-episode continuity; two additional TV series and several features would follow.  In the year 2199, the war with the planet Gamilon has turned the Earth's surface into a radioactive desert. The radiation will penetrate the bedrock protecting humanity's underground cities in another year, destroying all remaining life. A message arrives from Queen Starsha of the planet Iscandar, offering a way to eliminate the deadly radiation and providing plans for an engine that can power a ship across the 148,000 light-year gap. Scientists convert the ruined shell of the battleshipYamatointo a starship in a desperate attempt to save the planet, and the perilous voyage begins. The animation and character designs look very dated, but Gen-Xers who grew up watching it rememberStar Blazersvividly.

{"description": "Third time is not quite the charm for Eddie Murphy's Axel Foley when he heads for L.A. once again to avenge a friend's murder. This time he's off to the Disneyesque WonderWorld, apparently the most hazardous theme park in America despite an army of shady security agents. John Landis directed Murphy in his first film hit,Trading Places, and would seem a good match for this mix of action and comedy, but his sense of fun only emerges in a few scenes (chubby mechanics do a gymnastic Blues Brothers number to a Diana Ross tune) and his action direction is sloppy and shockingly violent. It seems wrong for the comic tone, and Murphy should have his foul mouth washed out with soap. On the plus side, Bronson Pinchot returns as Serge and all but upstages Murphy in two brief but hilarious scenes.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005U5A8", "B00005JKCB", "B00000I1JZ", "B000MGBSE4", "B00AEFXP8K", "B00AEFXBG6", "B00AEBB99Q", "B00BTYRB2G", "6304806450", "B004QXJZYO", "B000U1ZV8K", "B00005N5SA", "0790738953", "B000O78KW4", "B00004STUL", "B00005N5SB", "6305428441", "B00AEFY6TW", "B001TK80C0", "B00AEBB9AA", "B000FO0A9W", "B000069I1H", "B009WGYXIS", "B000CEV3M8", "B0006J28MI", "B00003CY5Y", "B001VLBDD0", "B00006FDBT", "B0001VTPW2", "B00029NMRM", "0790732149", "B0001VTPWC", "0790731924", "0790742012", "B000WGYMTC", "0767803434", "1558908404", "B000O77SRM", "0783227396", "B00005JL72", "B00005IBN0", "B0000639EX", "0783222149", "6305213283", "6305213305", "B001FB55HQ", "B004WJT5E2", "B00005QT9P", "B000FO0AA6", "B000YGDNPO", "B000065V3E", "B001AV3BYK", "B00AEFXT1S", "B000FI8MPW", "B001B3LIOC", "6304712987", "B002AS466O", "B000063UR3", "B002GHHHL0", "B000055Y0Y", "B0009X760U", "B000BBOUW2", "B00008977B", "B00005N5S5", "0783225539", "0780624890", "1558908846", "B0045HCIYA", "B004SIP9P6", "B00005JNTI", "B008G4T7W4", "B001NPD9LS", "B00004Z4WR", "B00AEFYDM2", "B004XQO8JG", "B00003GPFT", "B00AEFXPYY", "6304806434", "B008Y1YK9Y", "B002GHHHME", "B00AEFXPG2", "0790736411", "B00006HAWN", "B0006D3HGA", "B000VNMMR0", "B00008G8M4", "B005GT3X68", "B002O3Z50G", "B00000IQW2", "B0045HCJFS", "B00026ZG10", "B003AWRMCE", "B00008WFU4", "B00HW3L9MG", "0790732238", "B000WTVZGC", "B00BTYSIWI", "B00008DDXA", "B002ZG98LO", "B0000696HX"], "bought_together": ["B00005U5A8", "B00005JKCB"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005JKCB", "B00005U5A8", "B000MGBLSC", "B00AEBB99Q"]}, "price": 5.0, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 79172}, "asin": "B00005U5A9", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ARS42GDAL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Beverly Hills Cop III"}

{"description": "Among its many dubious distinctions,Hawk the Slayeris the only  sword-and-sorcery movie to feature Silly-String&#xAE; as a medieval weapon! This  splendidly wretched British fantasy also boasts such magical wonders as an  automatic fast-action crossbow and an archer who shoots instantly replenished  arrows in rapid succession, never missing his target! At the lowest ebb of his  career, Jack Palance is gleefully hammy as Voltan, the disfigured (i.e.,  irredeemably evil) elder brother of Hawk (John Terry), who swears vengeance  after Voltan kills their father, kidnaps a virginal abbess (Annette Crosbie),  and threatens a nunnery for ransom.

{"description": "On March 12, 2002,The Shieldburst onto the FX network like an incendiary grenade, and basic cable TV would never be the same. Creator Shawn Ryan's uncompromising police drama pushed the limits of basic-cable permissiveness, bridging the relative discretion ofNYPD Blueand the HBO liberties ofThe Wire. Without exception, these 13 episodes justify their hype, focusing on pugnacious detective Vic Mackey (Michael Chiklis), whose amoral Strike Team employs dubious tactics in the crime-ridden (and fictional) Farmington district of Los Angeles. Mackey and his maverick partners are at odds with seasoned detectives and beat cops, escalating tensions with precinct Capt. Aceveda (Benito Martinez), a Latino with flexible scruples and a political agenda.The series invites viewers to form their own judgments regarding Mackey's volatile behavior, which includes killing an undercover cop in the electrifying pilot episode. While each episode stands alone as groundbreaking drama, the arc of the series incorporates Aceveda's campaign to end Mackey's career; the self-loathing of a homosexual rookie (Michael Jace) whose partner (Catherine Dent) is Mackey's occasional mistress; a straight-laced detective (Jay Karnes) yearning for respect; Mackey's compassionate attempt to rehabilitate a crack whore (Jamie Brown, giving the season's finest guest performance); the autism of Mackey's young son and the recklessness of his closest partner (Walton Goggins); and the vigilant stoicism of Det. Wyms (CCH Pounder), who's as sensibly upright as Mackey is corrupted.Teeming with gang-bangers, perverts, rapists, and killers,The Shieldis unabashedly adult; even liberal viewers may flinch at plots involving child pornography and serial murder. Chiklis deservedly won an Emmy for maintaining the series' delicate morality; Mackey's a hero squirming in his own ethical quicksand. This daring edginess makesThe Shieldunique, and generous DVD supplements explore Ryan's creative impulse. Two featurettes offer behind-the-scenes overviews, while the all-episode commentaries allow extensive insight from every member of the series' principal cast and crew. Audition tapes prove that the cast was primed for ensemble excellence, and deleted scenes further demonstrate the series' challenging ambiguity.The Shieldis excellent TV for those who can grasp its complexities; all others beware.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0012CJQYG", "B0012CJQYQ", "B0012CJQZ0", "B0012CJQZA", "B0015TX2LO", "B0020TS5EM", "B0002ERXC2", "B00DJYJRHG", "B00188XHF8", "B0038M2APA", "B00123BY6S", "B000YW8RPE", "B0025KVKDE", "B0006IUD9Y", "B000QXDJLI", "B00B5J6A7W", "B00188XHFI", "B00005Y6YJ", "B0008JIJ1A", "B000FTCLSU", "B004HW7JNS", "B007A2Z3Y4", "B000GH3CWK", "B001NXDIMK", "B009VXVMAO", "B000ENUYGI", "B000FKO3GW", "B003XMKUEI", "B001DJLCRC", "B0060MYKYY", "B000NDEXK2", "B00EEDNR9A", "B002N5N5QQ", "B0024FAR5M", "B00008YGRU", "B00008PHCZ", "B00003CXOP", "B0000Y40PW", "B00AB65RUG", "B002ZCY80O", "B0058YPG1G", "B000BZISRG", "B0032UYFA6", "B001RTSPVY", "B003L77GK6", "B0002XVQSU", "B00CT48W14", "B000EXDS0C", "B0006FO5LO", "B0001O3YLM", "B00HUCF420", "B001934SNM", "B005SEDI5M", "B000Q6GUW0", "B000GB75CO", "B0058YPGSY", "B0058YPPN0", "B00BFAIH68", "B000OIOOVE", "B000V86OKG", "B00BUEUH6C", "B00ITAQ2T6", "B0001I55ZQ", "B001QE99AQ", "B000FIMG68", "B0024F08RO", "B00000FBH2", "B000P6YNSE", "B005LAJ16I", "B0015ABRE2", "B00J5LXT44", "B003CPPY5G", "B00HT850YW", "B005LAJ1H2", "B000FFJYE8", "B00005NOHO", "B000RO6JY0", "B000BOH8YG", "B00BC5I6Q2", "B009LDCZ7I", "B000CR7RCK", "B002DQSKME", "B000FUTVLO", "B0015RRNMA", "B002N5N5M0", "B009LDD54K", "B000GTLQVW", "B00915G6WQ", "B0007YMVWO", "B001MVWRNE", "B0036TGTF2", "B00BWDFP5E", "B002WQ799U", "B000BOH986", "B000RF1QE2", "B002WQ79A4", "B00031TYBC", "B000YABIQ6", "B00CD45JBG", "B0013ZGN9I"], "bought_together": ["B0012CJQYG", "B0012CJQYQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00DJYJRHG", "B0012CJQYG", "B0038M2APA", "B0012CJQYQ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 125999}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 24.99, "brand": "20th Century Fox", "asin": "B00006RCNW", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51G3B35AR4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Shield - The Complete First Season"}
{"description": "Many movies strive to capture the confused, yearning spirit of The Graduate or The Catcher in the Rye; Igby Goes Down succeeds. Igby (Kieran Culkin) is a teen struggling to find any purpose or meaning to his life; surrounding him are his tyrant mother Mimi (Susan Sarandon), schizophrenic father Jason (Bill Pullman), wealthy and deceitful godfather D.H. (Jeff Goldblum), and cold brother Oliver (Ryan Phillippe)--all of whom have their own problems. While evading being sent to yet another boarding school, Igby seeks solace with two women: Rachel (Amanda Peet), a drug-addicted dancer who's D.H.'s mistress, and Sookie (Claire Danes), a college student who becomes perhaps his only friend. Culkin carries the film, ably supported by the superb cast; script, direction, and performances are razor sharp. Igby Goes Down doesn't let anyone--including Igby--off the hook for their cruelty, hypocrisy, or lack of empathy. --Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00006JMQ4", "B002FP1426", "B00005JMJG", "B000FVQM2Y", "B000087JCE", "B00005JNC2", "B0000640VJ", "B0006TPE4C", "B0071HPP3M", "B00G3DA5XA", "6305428239", "1419897543", "B00005U14H", "B0041KKYF6", "B00FPUN57K", "B0016MJ6T2", "B000M5B98A", "B00HW3F1IO", "B00AEFY8MM", "B00DPUB5GA", "B00BN3ED8I", "B00003CXGA", "B0012E2GFK", "B0013D8LCC", "B0034G4OZE", "B000EDWKX8", "B0007UC8Y4", "B00013RC2K", "0767805763", "B000FFJYDY", "B00DW5IKYS", "B000K7VHQE", "0767821408", "B00009W5CA", "B0001EFUFK", "B0057ZAA6W", "B00005JL57", "B003U6SJYU", "B00D3DJIG8", "B00005V4XV", "B00000IC7G", "B0010X8NF0", "B003LXM1PK", "B000CS464G", "B000BZISVM", "B001CT05JE", "B00EO2I6SI", "B001PPLJIQ", "B00000G02H", "B00B04NIWM", "B00077BOFG", "B000ADWDFC", "B000BX8R10", "B00AFEY354", "B0001CNRRU", "B004OUZLGK", "B00005T30L", "B000BOH904", "B00GGMKSGM", "B0006J28KK", "B0010DM3R4", "B000V6LSOA", "B00023P4N8", "B004SUDQ72", "B00008K7AO", "0792839706", "B00AEFXE9U", "B00384TDZ8", "B005PTMPYA", "B0008JIJ10", "B00006AUIH", "B000QUEQ4K", "B00007L4KI", "B0000VV4OK", "0767821599", "B00005JNP4", "0767812158", "B0058ZPNOK", "B000CBG5PG", "B000NO39FG", "B000M4RG7E", "B002PLPQLU", "B001URA5XY", "B004IK30KA", "B007L6VR12", "B00996RSYM", "B000H0MKOC", "B00002E20R", "B000286RP2", "B002ONC9NC", "B008220BA2", "B00007AJF8", "B00003CWTI", "B00000IQW4", "B008OHV49W", "B00BMKGZVA", "B001FOK70S", "B004XVMCMG", "B00013RC7K", "B000F5GNX8"], "bought_together": ["B00006JMQ4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00006JMQ4", "B00005JMJG", "B002M9WW4E", "B0010X8NF0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 81400}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 18.98, "brand": "MGM (Video &amp; Dvd)", "asin": "B00007JXWX", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GWGWY7M9L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Igby Goes Down"}

{"description": "Matrixwriter-directors Larry and Andy Wachowski commissioned seven  artists from Japan, America and Korea to make nine short films set in the  world of theirfeature trilogy. Some of the top anime directors contributed  to this anthology, including Yoshiaki Kawajiri (Ninja Scroll), Koji  Morimoto (Robot Carnival), and  Shinchiro Watanabe (Cowboy  Bebop). Some of the films tie directly into the narrative of the live-action movies. Drawn in a style reminiscent of Jean \"Moebius\" Giraud, Mahiro  Maeda'sThe Second Renaissance(Part I & Part II) depicts the  human-machine wars that caused the enslavement of humanity and the creation  of the Matrix. The duel between two flamboyantly costumed Kabuki warriors in  Kawajiri'sProgramis an expanded version of the cybernetic training  Neo (Keanu Reeves) undergoes in the firstMatrixfilm. Watanabe evokes  the look of old newspaper photographs inA Detective Story,which  falls outside the storyline of the features. Fast-paced, violent and grim,The Animatrixis an uneven but intriguing compilation that represents  a new level in the ongoing cross-pollination between Japanese animation and  American live action.

{"description": "Depending on how you liked this romantic comedy, you just might find more laughs in the delightful banter between the director and his two stars on the commentary track. Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant join writer-director Marc Lawrence for a lively 102 minutes of conversation. Not much movie magic is discussed, but the three talents will sacrifice all for a good joke. It's best to watch the commentary track with the \"Two Bleeps Notice\" viewing option: when a heart appears on-screen, you can immediately view outtakes from that stage of the film. The flubs, on-set antics, and jokes are all guaranteed to bring a laugh. Other extras include two additional scenes (the wedding finale was judicially cut) and a HBO puff-piece on the making of the film. Yet the disc is a must-have for any fan of Bullock or Grant because it offers a chance to listen in on them; they're just as charming off-screen as on.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002K0WBXW", "6304765266", "B000023VTP", "B00005JPE3", "B000YDBPAM", "B00AEBB8NS", "B000HEWEE4", "0783235380", "B00003CXSM", "B0009OL7Z4", "B0000897EG", "B00AEBB8YW", "B0007PLLBU", "B0021L8UZS", "B00006ZXSO", "B00AEFY99O", "B0000AOV4I", "B004SIP9RO", "B004SIP8JI", "B00007E2F5", "B002O3Z4ZW", "B00008G7UF", "B00006ZXSQ", "B0038N9X3Q", "B001ECDVK4", "B00006FMUW", "B00005JPSM", "B002NZK5V4", "B002ZG989G", "B000MQC9H4", "B00066FB2A", "B000CEV3M8", "B00000JGHN", "B00005JN3W", "B00005JG6N", "B00005JL7Q", "B002SYAGNC", "B00004UEDQ", "B000CCBCAS", "B00081U7HC", "B0015I2RT8", "B00068GTK6", "B000NA1WE0", "B0006GANOQ", "B002ZG988M", "B00006ZXSN", "B00AEBB9WI", "B005XB8SRS", "6305213283", "B0045HCJJ4", "B002ZG9968", "B00E8RKHWW", "B004SEUJK0", "B00006ZXSL", "B000A343RI", "B00AKGG6JS", "B0006A9FIM", "B00005O5CM", "B00AEFXWXI", "6305236569", "B00008G6E8", "B00AEFXYOA", "B004EPZ070", "B002VECM6S", "B002P413IC", "B00AEFYWQY", "B000QGDY0G", "B003B3V0N4", "B0013D8LHC", "0780625277", "B003Y5H574", "B0000VD02Y", "0767811100", "B00164X59M", "6305736685", "B001AKTZW8", "B001WAKOW6", "B00EP2SN58", "B00EIBO8T6", "B000XJD33O", "B000BNX3B4", "B00006ZXSK", "B004SIP8LG", "B00005JM55", "0767821769", "B004SIP9VA", "B00AEFYSEA", "B0009KA2OA", "B001C5LLQ4", "B00164KYV4", "B002NZK5R8", "B002NZK5VO", "B002NZK5RS", "B000683VI4", "0800141660", "B0002Y121K", "B0071HPOGK", "B00AEFXKUI", "B00006ZXSI", "B003Y5H524"], "bought_together": ["B002K0WBXW", "6304765266"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002K0WBXW", "B004SIP9RO", "6304765266", "B000023VTP"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 18204}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.56, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00008NRI7", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51VJyiu%2ByUL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Two Weeks Notice (Full-Screen Edition) (Snap Case)"}

In the course of this 92-minute concert (plus loads of extra features), she wears enough different costumes and wigs to outfit a small (if rather odd) town, surrounds herself with dancers and acrobats galore, shows clips from her old TV series, and even plays all the roles in a delightful mini-version ofWest Side Story(one of the extras). Oh, and she sings too, covering everything from the Sonny & Cher years to her early solo career and her renaissance as a disco diva via \"Believe.\" Bottom line:The Farewell Touris a dynamic, sometimes silly, always entertaining show.

{"description": "When newly-commissioned SS Lieutenant Kurt Gerstein (Ulrich Tukur) witnesses the chemical disinfectant he's helped perfect being used to systematically murder interred Jews, he has no choice but to act. The only sympathetic ear Gerstein is able to find is that of a young Father Riccardo (Amelie's Mathieu Kassovitz), a priest with deep ties to the Vatican. While Riccardo takes on the obstructive Vatican hierarchy, Gerstein must walk a tightrope between documenting and enabling the atrocities his fellow SS officers cold-bloodedly commit. As the two unlikely allies fight to reveal the truth to the Church and the world, they discover that the fates of a man of conscience committing treason for the sake of humanity and a man of God committing heresy to thwart genocide are ultimately the same.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000087EYX", "B002IVDLH8", "B000PMGS7C", "B00005QAQI", "B00008RV0G", "B00005BJWC", "B00005YUO1", "B0070KCJLQ", "B0001DMW9S", "B00IKM5OTW", "B00JPJC8RK", "B00D3XM7H0", "B00049QJ9I", "B00IS6WPXS", "B00FL2EWYM", "B004EI2NWM", "B001UFE8PM", "B00ID8H8EW", "B004KL0OVU", "B000H5V8H2", "B00J0IN6Z4", "B00JEEZSUA", "B0000BWVCR", "B000KB48NE", "B00HLTD3ZW", "B00D3XMA9A", "B00007KQ9X", "B0047UJBJA", "B0002CX1NY", "B000FDFSYA", "B00HV2BG44", "B007UI0CIA", "B0012QE4PI", "B000YKT4BW", "B00EO2I6XS", "B0030ZIZTK", "B00H96KFV2", "B009XTF8NI", "B00JJRLFTU", "B00DPUB5LK", "B000TGCR38", "B002KECJZ8", "B00JVQ7PWU", "B00018D4PO", "B00DL48BM6", "B0036TGSV2", "B00JJRLFVS", "B00007ELEV", "B00C2535TE", "B00I116MZ2", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B003JLL2RW", "B000FVQLRA", "B00097DY66", "B00BC1UPRO", "B002WBYDR6", "B00005AUJR", "B005OTGS4E", "B00IVLR9JA", "B000093NQZ", "B00INB7UO2", "B00J5LXMTG", "B00IAR2CFG", "B00J2PQZBC", "B000AQ69R2", "B00H0EN948", "B004H9ZQ4K", "B00ID8HATK", "B00KDK64DY", "B00BWH6DK6", "B0055UBGEO", "B00006IUHK", "B003PMWF62", "B000OVLBGC", "B005HQBO9I", "B009XTF8MY", "B003K1H14E", "B0007R4SYU", "B00005JMLR", "B000TLTCPO", "B00G15MDI0", "B0049TC8CQ", "B002QP145C", "B0007ZEOPK", "B002Q5O6Y8", "B00AEFXRRO", "B000NA6CQ8", "B003YKYX7Y", "0375414347", "B005DKS1TE", "B00ENMZK1A", "B0041KKZIM", "B000HC2PLS", "B00IVLR9LI", "B002TQKL66", "B0002CR04A", "B002BWP4A6", "B002ID09BM"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AIBZMD6", "B00JEEZSUA", "B00HLTD3ZW", "B003AWRMBU"]}, "price": 19.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 200647}, "asin": "B00009W0W4", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51924YKWW5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Amen"}

{"description": "For years, animation buffs have waited impatiently for the Warner Bros.  cartoons to appear on DVD. The Warner shorts never commanded the budgets and  prestige of the Disney and MGM films, and won fewer Oscars than they deserved. But  decades after the best ones were created, they remain the quintessential  Hollywood cartoons: brash, fast-paced, aggressively funny and uniquely American.  Virtually everyone in the U.S. under the age of 60 grew up on these films, in  theaters and on TV. The 56 cartoons in the set (out of a studio output of over 1,000) were  transferred from good prints--which means the viewer can see dust, scratches, and  occasional mistakes by the cel painters. The films are all presented uncut, in  defiance of the killjoys who have insisted on censoring alleged \"violence\" in  the versions shown on television. Warner Bros. is obviously testing consumer response with this set. Although  the erratic selection includes many classics, purists will argue (correctly)  that it offers neither a fair representation of the directors'oeuvres,  nor anything approaching a coherent history of the characters or studio style.   (Nearly half the films were directed by Chuck Jones; only three are by Bob  Clampett, and there's nothing by Tex Avery or Frank Tashlin.)  But it seems petty to carp about omissions and biases when the discs offer  excellent, uncensored prints of some of the funniest films ever made in the  U.S.--or anywhere else. (Rated G, suitable for all ages: cartoon violence)--Charles Solomon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00020SK1Y", "B000ADS62G", "B000HC2LGM", "B000TSTEM8", "B001CO42CA", "B004176JHQ", "B0058O1FIY", "B004L9GM5S", "B0002MFGCI", "B000ZOXDK0", "B003U0AHGE", "B005LOBWA2", "B0000AYJXV", "B000PC1PAW", "B001CO42CK", "B007KW5MJU", "B0093I9114", "B000R7GKPU", "B000AOEMUA", "B00BTJTYB2", "B0033XKV96", "B000TSTEMI", "B001VEF7ZM", "B000ADS61M", "B0001CNQUS", "B003WOW5HW", "B0002ZMHVI", "B0007939QG", "B000P296AS", "B002GNOLY0", "B0001CNQVM", "B000HC2LGW", "B005DMHHHY", "B000FQIRYU", "B000AOEMTG", "B00009PJT0", "B001QU880M", "B0002ABU5C", "B000MTPA5Y", "B000A345C6", "B0000BWVAG", "B0002NY8XA", "B000ADS62Q", "B000E3L7FK", "B00961ENYI", "B0002I837M", "B0002VNYI2", "B005NFJAQC", "B00CX0KKLO", "B008N8A3JE", "B00080ZFZC", "B000AXWGRM", "B00005M989", "B00465I1BA", "B000AXWGRC", "B00AMSM9CW", "B000FS9MVA", "B000ROAK2W", "B00003CXG7", "B00E9ZATKI", "B0089J2818", "B00CMY3JBO", "B00009M9BK", "B00H1HYZ9C", "B0050MB5AC"], "bought_together": ["B00020SK1Y", "B000ADS62G"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005NFJAQC", "B007KW5MJU", "B0000AYJXV", "B00020SK1Y"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 8766}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"], ["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 38.98, "brand": "Looney Tunes", "asin": "B0000AYJXS", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51CO0b8nmIL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Looney Tunes: Golden Collection, Vol. 1"}

{"description": "Though it bears little resemblance to the original 1969 thriller starring Michael Caine, the 2003 remake ofThe Italian Jobstands on its own as a caper comedy that's well above average. The title's a misnomer--this time it's actually a Los Angeles job--but the action's just as exciting as it propels a breezy tale of honor and dishonor among competing thieves. Inheriting Caine's role as ace heist-planner Charlie Croker, Mark Wahlberg plays straight-man to a well-cast team of accomplices, including Mos Def, Jason Statham, and scene-stealer Seth Green in a variation of the role originally played by Noel Coward. As the daughter of Croker's ill-fated mentor (Donald Sutherland), Charlize Theron is recruited to double-cross a double-crosser (Edward Norton in oily villain mode), and once again, speedily versatile Mini Coopers play a pivotal role in director F. Gary Gray's exhilarating car-chase climax.

{"description": "Noted designer Mahiro Maeda gives this sci-fi adventure a striking, muted  look that mixes elements of Buck Rogers, Weimar Germany, and Napoleonic France.  Childhood friends Claus and Lavie dream of becoming a top Vanship team: daring  pilots who serve as mail couriers, flying their small ships to dangerous  destinations. Just as they're about to win an important race and establish the  reputation they desire, Claus insists they stop to aid a disabled ship. The pilot  entrusts them with Al, a mysterious little girl who is being pursued by an  angularmecha-ship. Although Lavie and Claus are clearly in over their  heads, they promise to see Al is taken to safety. The storytelling in this new  action-adventure is considerably less polished than its original visuals, and  the filmmakers fail to set up the odd, war-torn world of the series  satisfactorily.

{"description": "The Work of Director Michel Gondryinvites the lucky viewer into a wonderland of childlike imagination. Before the Versailles-born Gondry turned his creative ingenuity to feature films (beginning with the underratedHuman Natureand the 2004 Jim Carrey comedyEternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind), these 27 music videos and assorted \"stories and things\" formed a legacy of supreme cleverness, suggesting a creative lineage from the pioneering film magic of Georges M&#xE9;li&#xE8;s to the groundbreaking experimental films of Norman McLaren. It's perfectly fitting that the accompanying 75-minute documentary is titled \"I've Been 12 Forever,\" because Gondry (b. 1964) never lost the sense of wonder and inventiveness that children display when their minds are allowed to flourish in a creative environment. No wonder he's best known for his dazzling collaborations with Icelandic pop star Bj&#xF6;rk, resulting in music videos (seven included here) that redefined the magical potential of the medium. Each, in its own way, is a masterpiece of the fantastic.What's also remarkable about Gondry's work is its technical progression, from the homemade crudeness of his earliest videos for the French band Oui Oui, to the technical wizardry of Kylie Minogue's \"Come Into My World,\" in which the Australian pop star is seamlessly multiplied as she strolls around a busy Parisian intersection; like many of Gondry's videos, it's a stunning \"how-did-they-do-that?\" work of art, reminiscent of Zbigniew Rybcynski's prize-winning 1982 short \"Tango.\" From the hilarious dreamworld of the Foo Fighters' most popular video \"Everlong\" to the painstaking pixilation of Gondry's videos for the White Stripes (one made entirely of animated Lego blocks), this DVD is packed with Gondry's tireless pursuit of perfection; he'll do whatever's necessary, no matter how simple or complex, to achieve perfect harmony between song, artist, and visual concept. All the while, he's drawing from a seemingly endless well of inspiration, as evident in the delightful 52-page booklet of stories, drawings, photos, and interviews that chronicle the eternal sunshine of a brilliant mind.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000AZT2X", "B0000DBJ9I", "B0009WIEF2", "B000M4RG7E", "B002TUX948", "B0000714E6", "B00K5T1LZY", "B00H9HZGQ0", "B0017RFY56", "B003O3EKSS", "B00008RH3J", "B00EALTVPA", "B001V7RTAK", "B00GMV8KGW", "B00IUKPIXG", "B0018LX9VC", "B00G3DA63Y", "B00BGDQNLU", "B0000648ZP", "B0042FUHSY", "1934781975", "6304493681", "B00000G02H", "B001B1UO7G", "B007A4Y1Q8", "B00HVOFP08", "B0001LJCQQ", "B0007P0X9G", "B008220DIC", "B0007UC8Y4", "0810943573", "B000068OCS", "B000EHRVOM", "B00HG30C34", "B003498RCW", "B00471400O", "B0057GYOBI", "B00DPUB59W", "B001HN699A", "B00003CXUM", "B000CQQID0", "B000JRYOMY", "B00BJB2GUQ", "B0035G5IOE", "B00BSN0VZ2", "B00022M51I", "081099741X", "B002WJHDJI", "B000S0GYRU", "B00BC75H5S", "B001G7Q640", "B00005YU1O", "B0011E5M66", "B00D7AM5XU", "B0000AOX0F", "B005WMQ5R8", "B007L6VR6M", "B00GST8UB8", "B00000K3TH", "B000787ZV2"], "bought_together": ["B0000AZT2X", "B0009WIEF2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0009WIEF2", "B0000AZT2X", "B00065AXTM", "B000FMH8RG"]}, "price": 23.58, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 20680}, "asin": "B0000DBJ9J", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41FerrjvKgL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Director's Series, Vol. 3 - The Work of Director Michel Gondry"}

After they meet repeatedly at Charles de Gaulle Airport outside Paris, beautician Binoche and chef Reno decide to share an airport hotel room during a layover. She's a self-dramatizing chatterbox with a fondness for make-up and perfume; he's a fussy neurotic who can't stand artificial fragrances. They've just met and they're headed to different parts of the globe, but still... could this be... amour? Director Daniele Thompson, whose previous feature,La Buche, was a much more entertaining effort, would like it to be so. But the setting gets monotonous and the stakes never seem terribly urgent.

{"description": "TheCatalog of CooldescribesGreen Acresthis way:To be truly cool, one must genuinely understand the uselessness of logic and reason in a world gone mad.... Eddie Albert (ostensibly sane) spent six seasons appealing to the whacked out citizens of Hooterville to behave in a rational and orderly manner. Naturally, he got just what he deserved--the gradual erosion of his own mental stability. Aficionados of this show like to call it surreal. I call it real life.All one can add to that, to paraphrase the classic title song, is that DVD is the place forGreen Acresto be. Hooterville may have been condemned by critics as a vast wasteland, but as the first season demonstrates, it provides fertile ground for bizarre behavior for a gallery of classic characters who rival the residents ofTwin Peaks.  \"Oliver Buys a Farm,\" the series pilot, is a comparatively tame episode that gives little hint of the weirdness to come. Lawyer Oliver Wendell Douglas (Albert), weary of life in New York (\"It's a rat race, and the rats are winning!\" he declares), buys the Haney place to the horror of his socialite wife Lisa (Eva Gabor), whose ditziness has yet to be established. Look for appearances byPetticoat Junctiondenizens Uncle Joe (Edgar Buchannan), Sam Drucker (Frank Cady), Hooterville Cannonball engineer Floyd Smoot (Rufe Davis), and everyone's favorite wonder pig, Arnold Ziffel.Among the season's other episodes, in \"The Day of Decision,\" all of Hooterville wonders whether \"she will\" or \"she won't\" as Lisa chooses between life on the farm or returning to New York. In \"Never Look a Gift Tractor in the Mouth,\" Hooterville is beginning to look like Peyton Place when Doris Ziffel (Barbara Pepper) becomes convinced that her husband Fred (Hank Patterson) and Lisa are having an affair. \"Lisa Bakes a Cake,\" in which Lisa lists Oliver in the phone book as an attorney, is about as flat and heavy as one of Lisa's infamous creations.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0006TPE1U", "B000BITV1A", "B001E6JC30", "B008K1PX7Q", "B0025X4PBA", "B001BN4WHW", "B001NRPQKI", "B0009OUBPQ", "B001LM64VK", "B00FJO95TE", "B00DICPAMU", "B000HWZ4J8", "B00DXLO0D6", "B002AMVEHY", "B0009B16TO", "B000E33VZ4", "B00DXLO086", "B00HJQMFF6", "B000BT96OG", "B000EQ46HI", "B0050MB5AC", "B00A2L1CKO", "B001DHXT4I", "B002WIDRL2", "B0063FGERO", "B001MBTSTU", "B0002NY8PI", "B001DZOCZU", "B000B7HZUK", "B00005JNS8", "B0007KIFK0", "B000FSMEB0", "B000ASDFIQ", "B00000F61N", "B001N26GSE", "B00DXLO0BI", "B0018TN73Y", "B0077T5SBS", "B0009SCVBY", "B000EGDANO", "B001992NXI", "B000A6T1J0", "B000HEZEYG", "B0038SUBBO", "B005SQRYOG", "B00FFARI7I", "B000PISZ86", "B00HYXZ1PU", "B000NOK0J4", "B000YKYT1M", "B000V3JGIS", "B000NA21YA", "B000N6UF10", "B005SQRYRS", "B002AL2TQK", "B007R5S0YY", "B002OOWL16", "B000291Q3Y", "B0006BAWSI", "B0030BS1E8", "B008KZX7W0", "B0007Y08P6", "B00005JLIC", "B00H8KC1N4", "B001SLNPSO", "B0001DMXEC", "B003K1NGXE", "B000EXZFS0", "B00096S480", "B0000BV1XX", "B000E3L7EQ", "B006UI5ARY", "B0057IY5EW", "B000TJBNF8", "B000NVIGDY", "B005UFUU6E", "B00005JOEB", "B0006Z2L4W", "B00650RX90", "B0009NZMYC", "B0014FAIYS", "B00HJQM9ZM", "B00AADAEHQ", "B005BUA1F8", "B000H1RFF0", "B008D19WQ6", "B0096RC57O", "B000MGBSQC", "B002DPH91I", "B00280QNKG", "B0030U1TCK", "B001GMH8WE", "B00EQ2KU7G", "B001LRTT30", "B000E3L7FK", "B00008EY6N", "B00IS6WQ2S", "B00G5N6C8U", "B000AOEMU0", "B00GHH9HW2"], "bought_together": ["B0006TPE1U", "B000BITV1A"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0006TPE1U", "B000BITV1A", "B00DXLO086", "B00144NHV0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 14201}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 18.99, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B0000V4906", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51254BVYJZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Green Acres: The Complete First Season"}

In \"Cannon Fodder,\" Katsuhiro Otomo (Akira) uses long tracking  shots and an acid palette of khaki greens and faded reds to depict a militarized  civilization where gargantuan machines dominate vapid little people. This  brief but timely vision of the insanity of war suggests a mixture of 19th century  Prussia and World War II Japan.

{"description": "The 2003 debut ofChappelle's Showon Comedy Central marked a high point for the cable channel, and now the entire, wildly creative first season can be seen, with hundreds of bleeps removed. That's not to sayChappelle's Showis perfect entertainment: there are too many moments among the 12 episodes here that descend into pointless scatology and booty fever. But for the most part, Chappelle, a talented comic slowly growing into greatness, is trying to push the sketch-humor envelope and succeeds at surprising us with original concepts and merciless execution.The merely clever material includes \"National Geography's Third World Girls Gone Wild,\" basically an update on those topless-native-women gags of yore, and Chappelle's \"Educated Guess Line,\" in which the sage comic eschews psychic powers to logically deduce racial insights from his callers' questions. Far more wicked is an in-your-face satire on such autobiographical film fare asAntwone Fisherand8&nbsp;Mile, in which Chappelle plays himself ascending from street hustler to rapper-comedian to bona fide savior of America. The best thing here, however, is a parallel-universe version ofThe Real World, in which the usual racial proportions on MTV's workhorse series are reversed, thrusting a token white guy into a Hoboken houseful of crazy African Americans. There are also laughs in \"Ask a Gay Guy with Mario Cantoned,\" as well as a sketch about an \"inner-thoughts cam\" and a nasty piece about Chappelle's Make-a-Wish visit to a dying child, which decays into a cruel video game competition. Overlooking the series' weaker material, this is outstanding television comedy.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0006Q93CO", "B000FZETIE", "B000095J1K", "B000O59A2A", "B0009VRHLU", "B000FMH8RG", "B0016KCCCM", "B0036TGTEI", "B000F8O2QK", "B0001XAODE", "B000H6SY32", "B008FRJDVC", "B000CNESLM", "B0006HBZE2", "B000LV6VYW", "B0008KLV96", "B000F48D14", "B0000TPA60", "B0041QSZS8", "1558908390", "B004P7CMZ0", "B008F282QO", "B002XUBDXS", "B0001ZWLVU", "B0000714BU", "B0006N2F04", "B00319ECE2", "B002CA68N4", "B001HB1K0A", "B000UAE7Q8", "B001O0TWXG", "B00AEFYE08", "B002N5N5NE", "B0018O5WUU", "B000063RQO", "B000EMGJAO", "B002LCOGBE", "B0018BDDF4", "B00AEFXDAK", "B002OOK6WM", "B000FSME2Y", "B00023P49M", "B0006N2EZU", "B0030Y11UG", "B00003CY51", "B000ADWCYY", "B0018RKEQE", "0783237367", "B0000696I2", "B000RW3VDE", "0767821955", "B000CNESM6", "B006W93ELK", "B00005JLG1", "B005GRF34U", "B002OID4WM", "B004SIP6LS", "B004SIP8ES", "B000KLQUMQ", "B00BTYPWDQ", "B000B5XOR0", "B0006Z2L2Y", "B000071ZZJ", "B0056EBHEI", "B00AEFZ7F4", "B001EOQVA4", "0767830555", "B000BITV9W", "B00002R0MA", "B001PCNZHW", "B0000399WN", "B00AEFZ8OY", "B000056WR6", "630529142X", "B000P5FH5S", "B00014NE9E", "B000BKJ762", "B000U1ZV1W", "B004SIP93S", "B001D2WUDO", "B000GPIPTM", "B00AMSM9AO", "B002CA68MU", "B00005N89M", "B0002UE1WQ", "B000HT3P6U", "B00ANDDBBY", "B001L1S1PS", "B0000C2IQW", "B000BOH8X2", "B0000A98ZO", "B0000CABL2", "B0019L0ACM", "B004LWZW5G", "B000GRUN40", "B000A0GP0Y", "B000M9CB4W", "B001DJLD0S", "B0001MZ7KA"], "bought_together": ["B0006Q93CO", "B000FZETIE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B008FRJDVC", "B0006Q93CO", "B000FZETIE", "B000O59A2A"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 14569}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 10.94, "brand": "Paramount", "asin": "B00018YCIM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51YG7TYRPML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Chappelle's Show - Season 1 Uncensored"}
{"description": "The most fearless film yet by France's idiosyncratic Olivier Assayas (Irma Vep) is an unholy marriage of ruthless corporate thriller and sinister science fiction. Connie Nielsen is the American \"ice princess\" in a French multination, an ambitious executive whose betrayals and invasive tactics would make her a villain in any other film. Here she's just a pawn in a shadowy conspiracy that may involve contemptuous new assistant Chloe Sevigny and fellow dealmaker Charles Berling and takes her from the legal (if unsavory) commerce of Japanese Internet porn to the brutal market of underground pornography. Assayas directs his modern corporate nightmare with a voyeuristic style, a hard eye for disturbing images, and more passion than explanation. It isn't his most audience-friendly film, but his portrait of international commerce and image culture in the 21st century is impassioned and haunting--cinema for viewers hungry for ambitious and provocative filmmaking.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000633RZ", "B001G0LC1E", "B0085Z3ATU", "B001662FK0", "B00GRZPRB4", "B000MRA6XM", "B00005JMIJ", "B0009VRHLK", "B000A2X46K", "B00JJ3EHCG", "B00019075S", "B000FGG72O", "B008NNY8XQ", "B00HOGBXS6", "B0007939R0", "B00006ADES", "B00G7QPXUI", "B006M3M5FM", "B00006IUHF", "B0087OULO6", "B00ET2ODTE", "B00F8PTALC", "B001CIOCNK", "B0007W6HVM", "B00LEW3L5Y", "B000B6H1YG", "B00007ELES", "B00C8CQ5SO", "B00HT2RTU6", "B00004U104", "B00BEJL4RO", "B003UESJLU", "B00827OWO8", "B0079K4WEE", "B00005JKJA", "B00GPPXNQ2", "B009OCR2U6", "B0001DMVBC", "B001LRJH32", "B00005BJW9", "B000CBG5PG", "B0000844LU", "B0088749L8", "B001MEJY8W", "B004OUZLGK", "B0004Z32NI", "B006KH6CF4", "B00005QAQI", "6305065551", "B006PTL1QM", "B00IKUBR5O", "B004DTLKEE", "B003M98800", "B009POCG0Y", "B0002I84DK", "B008U3PIOW", "B0002ZDWVM", "B007XF0XUW", "B0067QZCXQ", "B00APUAKYG", "B00GTZWUPS", "B0015HZA5M", "B007XF0W3K", "B00AEFXV3E", "B00GST8U4U", "3901644431", "B000A343RS", "B000PMFS2I", "B0000A0DX2", "B0011NVC16", "B000KJTFGQ", "B00029NKTM", "B0006H30G8", "B0007ZSFK0", "B00007ELFU", "B00CN70M60", "B00004WG25", "B00005R5GY"], "bought_together": ["B0000633RZ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000PMFS2I", "B0009VRHLK", "6305065551", "B00AQYUY9C"]}, "price": 22.98, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 324052}, "asin": "B00019079O", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HP2XKB2HL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Demonlover (R-Rated Edition)"}

{"description": "This two-disc set certainly improves upon the fluffyReloadedDVD release. Although there's still no Wachowski brothers talking about their creation, there's a lot of good stuff here in the three main segments. We are constantly reminded how long the back-to-back filming schedule was, and it's most interesting to hear from the actors and artists as they come to the end of this long road. When a white rabbit flashes on screen, you can \"branch\" the most interesting documentary footage: how \"bullet time\" is being recalibrated and how you go about replicating so many Agent Smiths. A timeline is wonderfully put together, but cumbersome to navigate through. The extras certainly illustrate how the movie did not deserve to be passed over for a few technical Oscar nominations.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000AXE8I", "B000P0J0AQ", "B00008LDPU", "B001TK80C0", "B00005N5S5", "B001VLBDD0", "B000AYELVA", "B004LWZW42", "B004LWZWGA", "B001FB55HQ", "B001HN697M", "B000EGDB10", "B0002J4X1Q", "B001GCUO1Q", "B00005JN0T", "B00005JNJV", "B003Y5H5EW", "B001GKJ2E8", "B005LAIHXQ", "B000UR9T8C", "B000VWYJ86", "B009MO57H6", "B00005JMEW", "B00005JMUA", "B00003CWT6", "B001DHXT20", "B00005JKZV", "B00005JKCH", "B000HCO83Q", "B000U7WV1Y", "B000099635", "B0000VAFO0", "B000HRMAPE", "B001DJLD1M", "B008JFUS0U", "B000VR0570", "B005LAIGW8", "B001GZ6QC4", "B005G4TJUC", "B000QXDED6", "B000P0J06K", "B0087ZG7NO", "B00005JLXH", "B004LWZWFQ", "B00003CXTA", "B00IKM5LXG", "B00005JKWJ", "B002ZG98UA", "B0002KVUKM", "B00004STUL", "0780624890", "B00011CZRE", "B004SIP95G", "B00005JKZY", "B00005JA8B", "B00E5I2M6I", "B0090SI56Y", "B0009MDPYM", "B008JFUPFI", "B00005JNTU", "B002IPFWTE", "B000P0J06U", "B001F7MSFM", "B000AYELVU", "B007K3JFUQ", "B00005JMQW", "B0049IHX2C", "B0007P0XBO", "B008Y1YK9Y", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B0085A9HU6", "B00AEFY5B6", "B008JFUO72", "B00006HBUJ", "B001AK3S4Y", "B000P0J0EW", "B0007V6ITE", "0767834739", "B00005JLWN", "B0000VCZK2", "B00FEHCQEC", "B0014Z4ON4", "B001UV4XHY", "B002GSXKNI", "B00BEZTMFY", "B00070FX5U", "B00177YA1K", "B00005JKIP", "B003QO8TOQ", "B000U1ZV8K", "B002ZG980U", "B0007DFJ0G", "B0045HCJGC", "B00000JQB5", "B00005JL78", "B004EPYZUS", "B002ZG99QS", "B000AP04FG", "B000HEVZ9E", "B000OVLBF8"], "bought_together": ["B0000AXE8I", "B000P0J0AQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001DJLD1M", "B000P0J0AQ", "B0000AXE8I", "B001BRJZPW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 123737}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.95, "brand": "Matrix", "asin": "B0001BKAEE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5149DT5Y2CL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Matrix Revolutions (Two-Disc Full Screen Edition) [DVD]"}
{"description": "Somebody smart produced the director's commentary track forBig  Fish; they brought in an interviewer to keep Tim Burton on track, thus  avoiding those moments when a director gapes silently at his movie,  grasping for some fresh thought. This sense of control, however, fosters a  somewhat corporate atmosphere, which also infests the typically fatuous  featurettes about \"The Character's Journey\" and \"The Filmmakers' Path.\"  Which is not to say they're a waste: Ewan McGregor is simply the most  charming man in the world; the various beasties in the movie are  technically interesting; and there's an interesting bit about the author  of the book and the screenwriter, usually two of the most ignored figures  in cinema. There's also a mildly diverting trivia quiz about Tim Burton's  earlier movies.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["1616201649", "B0000YTP02", "B00AEBBAEK", "B0000AC8LI", "B002UOMH00", "B0000VD04M", "B00AEBBA72", "B001AGXEAG", "B001ECDVKE", "B00A8KJK7G", "B000077VR3", "B00H3UKZ6E", "B001HN694K", "B008QE9XD2", "B000K7VHQE", "B0079K4WEE", "1565122178", "B000BB1MI2", "B004A8ZWV0", "B0001ADAVK", "B00005V9HH", "B002ZG980U", "B00447L4JG", "B0057ZAA6W", "B00005JKIS", "B00006LPGP", "B00003CXRM", "B00005JLSB", "B000P0J06U", "B004SIP7PS", "B00AEFY0F2", "B0006FYOTC", "B000E6ESL2", "B000P0J06K", "B00006JDU8", "B001CK1D44", "B0036TGSR6", "B005LAIIHG", "B00005JMJG", "B000LC55F2", "B00008G8M5", "B0010X73ZG", "B000RJO578", "B000P0J0BK", "B001J9KJ4I", "6305212112", "B00128VA76", "B004U7MR14", "B000C3L27U", "B000F8DBDK", "B00004WG2F", "B001OST0M6", "B000089778", "B00006JMSM", "B0009IOR5M", "B0000AK7AA", "B00005JKJJ", "B00003CXC3", "B003UAKE9Y", "B002VWNIEA", "B0006UEVT0", "B000NO39FG", "B00005NB8K", "B0000640VJ", "B001QOGYBI", "B000O76ZQC", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B000O76T72", "B004SIP92O", "B00008L3U1", "B005I0DV4Y", "B003L20IJM", "0767836324", "B004SEUIXS", "B001HN69AY", "B000A7DVR2", "B00003CXIP", "B000053VAZ", "B001KVZ6FW", "B000P0J0EW", "B000J4P9P8", "B001E1HCRI", "B00003CXZ4", "B0000VD02Y", "B000N6U0E2", "B00AEBB9K0", "B0001XALGY", "B00004Y87O", "B004SIP8W0", "B002GIBVV6", "B004EPYZU8", "B005LAIHYU", "B004SIP6BI", "B0010X8NF0", "B00AEFZ6V4", "B004SIP7ZS", "B000LXH0AE", "B00AEBB9SM", "B00009W5CA", "B002NZK5V4"], "bought_together": ["B0000YTP02"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0000YTP02", "1616201649", "B00E8RKHWW", "B00CWM58WY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 3909}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.98, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B0001GOH6Q", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51BHMMY1RSL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Big Fish"}

{"description": "\"We have evil in us, all of us do, and my evil just happened to come out  because of the circumstances,\" said serial killer Aileen Wuornos in an  interview conducted shortly before her execution in 2002. Director Nick  Broomfield, in this sequel to his previous documentaryAileen Wuornos:  The Selling of a Serial Killer, delves further into Wuornos's horrific  childhood (including an interview with her biological mother) and follows  the appeals process as her case goes through its final efforts. But the  movie's core are the fascinating, devastating interviews with Wuornos  herself, alternately lucid and delusional as she obsesses about the  police, whom she believes allowed her murders to happen to increase the  potential for profit from movies and books about the case. Anyone who's  seenMonster, based on Wuornos's story, will find the real woman  even more compelling and frightening than Charlize Theron's award-winning  portrayal.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0001KNHM2", "B0029Z8K74", "1593762909", "B001LN6NRE", "B0051QS1P4", "B001BEK8CO", "B008I1G6Y2", "0786034149", "B0029Z8K7E", "B000M9BPF8", "B000NDIAQA", "B000050HEP", "B0051QS1R2", "B005IQGNHK", "B00003CWN3", "B000RW5BYG", "B0051QS1OK", "B001BXTPPQ", "1844542378", "B002FUIIYS", "B00008DDJ4", "B003VOVW18", "B000S0SYHI", "B0051QS1RM", "B006Z7Z3L8", "B002K0UNZA", "B000BB154I", "B00160ANUA", "B0051QS1OA", "B001BEK8FQ", "B007NNPJBM", "B0021L8UPS", "B0051QS1Q8", "B00000K0DQ", "B00AIBZKFG", "B00EI2CT7S", "B006IRQU44", "B000A2X3QG", "B00347AIOO", "0312984189", "B000KLQUUS", "B004JR3OKI", "B005F0TH1S", "B00BUWD7E8", "B000EOTEEK", "B00527TSV8", "B00AEFXBPM", "B004DTLKEE", "B0023GFWWU", "B00027JYNK", "B0045HCIYA", "B00007AJE1", "B0042DN4U4", "B0002KPIQY", "B003VWC4BW", "B000MNOXX0", "B00005QAQI", "B002LVVEG0", "B00013RC2K", "B001GZM44I", "B008UIAMVQ", "B00005U14H", "B000E0OBJM", "B002NZK5RI", "B000NIVJFY", "B001IHJ97Y", "0743417607", "0790742829", "B00GHJ3T92", "B00009WVSL", "0929387759", "1561712930", "B007XF0W3K", "1844540790", "B0009A40ES", "0131141619", "0739441957", "B003WKQ47S"], "bought_together": ["B0001KNHM2", "B0029Z8K74"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0029Z8K74", "B0001KNHM2", "1593762909", "B008I1G6Y2"]}, "price": 18.72, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 174913}, "asin": "B0001Z36Y6", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51M5J87FFYL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Aileen - Life and Death of a Serial Killer"}
{"description": "An uncommonly powerful film,Broken Wingscaptures a family in  mid-disintegration: A midwife at an Israeli hospital struggles to hold her  children together in the wake of their father's death. Maya, a gaunt, pale  young woman, aspires to win a band contest; Ido, a boy bullied at school,  tries to film himself jumping from heights; Yair, a teenage boy, wallows  in the meaninglessness of existence as he hands out flyers, dressed in a  mouse costume. This may sound tedious or excruciating, but it's given  vivid life by an incredible cast and a humor that manages to be absurd and  a little sad at the same time. The movie embraces its characters with a  profound empathy; it's hard to imagine that anyone could watchBroken  Wingsand not be deeply moved by the end. Not surprisingly, the movie  has won numerous awards at film festivals around the world.--Bret  Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000OCY7KS", "B00772HQTC", "B0009YVBGO", "B0013HL6ES", "B00AZMFM3I", "B0000694XO", "B002MQM4FO", "B00CNIDH70", "B00ATK0452", "B001KVZ6AM", "B002M36R50", "B000E8QVAQ", "B009V0LRJI", "B00DJYJOPG", "B00IHBSANI", "B000EHQ7JC", "B0046AKAY6", "B000YMDJ02", "B005J47QQ8", "B00FL2EWYM", "B00AADAEH6", "B001BGTWTM", "B000E0OE44", "B00265T7JC", "B00008H2NK", "B000LW7P2I", "0062282697", "B005PYEQH4", "B000BLBZFW", "B00000IGV4", "B00E849QSG", "B002U4F5W2", "B000HEZEUU", "B003MT2EHS", "B00008HC96", "B00EVU3RGE", "B000OT6V5U", "B004GIJ2AQ", "B00A6HHJNS", "1741791383", "B00116VG3M", "B0006A9GCM", "B0001KNHAO", "B000EWBKYO", "B0036TGTDE", "B00BVJJSMA", "162022027X", "B002T921C0", "B000T5O48A", "B001E2PQGG", "9653070274", "B003JLL2RW", "B005KML1FG", "B0000541TP", "B001HYC4HA", "B00007JZV7", "B001DJ9PS0", "B004GFE33U", "B00003CYBS", "B008GWJJ42", "B005KMBXLS", "B006G1QDR6", "B00007JZV8", "1400049598", "B00B2TURYC", "B0002Z8CJO"], "bought_together": ["B000OCY7KS", "B0013HL6ES"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0009YVBGO", "B00DJYJOPG", "B0000694XO", "B00AZMFM3I"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 212344}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.95, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B000255L98", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51B0K1W6YHL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Broken Wings"}

{"description": "The younger you are, the more you'll enjoy UPN's short-lived revival ofThe Twilight Zone. Front-loaded with young actors (or marginal celebrities, like Jessica Simpson) and a bone-jarring theme by Korn's Jonathan Davis, the show panders to a teen demographic, which original-series creator Rod Serling would never have tolerated. It's a pale copy ofSerling's original, and even the 1985TZrevival was marginally better, but there are some memorable exceptions in this 43-episode, six-disc set. Not surprisingly, the best episodes are straight remakes of (or sequels to) classic Serling originals, including \"The Monsters on Maple Street,\" \"It's Still a Good Life\" (with former child actor Bill Mumy reprising his creepiest role, and featuring a series-best performance by Cloris Leachman), and \"Eye of the Beholder.\" Of the originals to this series, highlights include the pilot episode with Jeremy Piven; Jason Alexander in \"One Night at Mercy,\" Amber Tamblyn in \"Evergreen\"; Lukas Haas in \"Harsh Mistress\"; Lou Diamond Phillips in \"The Pool Guy\";ER's Eriq La Salle as writer, director, and star of \"Memphis\"; and a few others that capture the eerie quality of \"another dimension of sight, sound, and mind.\"Woefully miscast as the series' host, Forest Whitaker delivers facile introductions devoid of Serling's literary finesse. More often than not, the writing relies on forgettable characters and thinly-disguised variations on original-series themes; at its worst, the series demonstrates a staggering lack of originality, and the youthful casting frequently results in one-dimensional performances, with a few notable exceptions. It's hit-or-miss at best, but shooting locations in Vancouver, British Columbia, lend the series a visually stimulating variety of settings and atmosphere; production values are consistently high (as they were in the Canadian seasons ofX-Files), and Rick Maguire deserves praise for his cinematography on virtually every episode. If you can forget Serling altogether (a difficult challenge for his devoted fans), you'll be able to overlook the flaws and enjoy some occasionally clever trips intoThe Twilight Zoneas it was meant to be.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00092ZLDK", "B00068NVLQ", "B00JKTFQJM", "B00005JOJE", "B0007CEXUY", "B003VJTGNE", "B00LT1JHLW", "B000B5IP4W", "B0002CX1M0", "B001DXS4DI", "B000H5U5EE", "B006TBYC76", "B00BQK4YDC", "B00005JN8Q", "B0002NRRRE", "B00KTZALDC", "B003BNO9GO", "B004E5BQDW", "B000Q8X1IE", "B000UYN9M2", "B00LMBURDG", "B00GSMZ3I8", "B00L9K2EGS", "B00013D54Y", "B001A7GOCA", "B00BI3XZA0", "B000BCKFXE", "B003NOGNQU", "B00LLAV26O", "B001HNDR4A", "B002EP8FDI", "B000OPOAKW", "B0007XG2YS", "B002HK9HZU", "B00GT4NCBU", "B007I8KXQ8", "B000GYI340", "B00C6F61S2", "B002FLOTPO", "B000FFJZO2", "B000RIWAV2", "B0016MOWNM", "B000BC8T1E", "B000AL733G", "B0030E5PYO", "B00KUS5YGC", "B00KDU8HQQ", "B008X8VM1W", "B000HEVZ94", "B00JK47BHM", "B00026L7OU", "B00KB614HQ", "B0045Z2W0C", "B00004REEI", "B005UL4NF2", "1879505096", "B00I3C1T6G", "B004SUDQCW", "B003NKU9XM", "B000SULWKO", "B006BZ8NSE", "B00KYCA4QY", "B00IED43X0", "B00000F3SB", "B002NPY7GS", "B000AYEIIQ", "B003H9LIU2", "B000092T3Y", "B000E0OBJM", "B00EEEHLKU", "B000F3UAE8", "B00KI27R4M", "B00HHYF56Q", "B000EXDS2A", "B0042FJCKS", "B00IYRLUEG", "B00EQ2KXA0", "B000EOTV98", "B0006Z2NYA", "B00EQ2KXL4", "B000HDR814", "B000BOH8Z0", "B00IXXVCT4", "B00I462XLG", "B00BTYPW7C", "B000068V9T", "B0074B2N9O", "B000TJBNF8", "B00IYJFB2G", "B00363WGIM", "B000CEV3MI", "B002FG9N50", "B00HMOWA0A", "B000FOPPBA", "B00E96AY20", "B000E5N6B6", "B0055SNHQG", "B0002S94BQ", "B00IQAUO48", "B00C25352Q"], "bought_together": ["B00092ZLDK", "B00068NVLQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00068NVLQ", "B000H5U5EE", "B00092ZLDK", "B00BI3XZA0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 27530}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 16.49, "brand": "", "asin": "B0002J4ZX2", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ETWSXNM4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Twilight Zone - The Complete Series (Season One)"}

{"description": "When a movie can blend passionate social concern with good old-fashioned suspense, it must be doing something right.Maria Full of Gracescores high on both counts. Maria is a Colombian teenager who, for a large paycheck, agrees to be a mule for drug-runners:  she has to swallow dozens of thumb-sized capsules of heroin and smuggle them into New York. This debilitating process is painstakingly described, and of course not everything goes as planned when Maria and her fellow mules land in America. Director Joshua Marston is working on a low budget, which explains the film's narrow, single-minded focus--but this may be a strength, not a weakness. The trump card is the lead performance of Catalina Sandrino Moreno, who won awards at the Seattle and Newport Film Festivals. Her empathetic face carries us along on Maria's journey, and humanizes a problem that is too easily relegated to a headline.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002FHGESI", "B00005JNCZ", "B0041KKYF6", "B000N3T0DW", "B00080Z53O", "B000O76ZQC", "B00005N8A9", "B00180IPM6", "B00008AOX5", "B0036TGSJE", "B008S2NABI", "B000YIGNCC", "B0007NBJHI", "B0042EJDGM", "B000RHRGSK", "B00AZMFKXK", "B005HFI7IU", "B000LV6OC6", "B00005JL57", "B0015ET3YO", "B003A0T8BO", "B004XVMCMG", "B000WC38IC", "B002M2T1VI", "B000N3SU6K", "B001ILTUKQ", "B0052LE7C4", "B005FIXA6S", "B002E01LOI", "B00GJNQ3S0", "B0047685T6", "B00075VX2C", "B00005JLQW", "B000AM4P90", "B001UV4XC4", "B004SIP7S0", "B00006G8G3", "B004SIP6GI", "B00005LZOD", "B0011FLH14", "B004MNM1FI", "B002M2T1V8", "B0086900LG", "B002BWP3UC", "B00E5G03KM", "B000AYEIDQ", "B00134PSV8", "B001FOPOD8", "B0000AMU29", "B00003CXRG", "B0014BQR6U", "B000274TLW", "B000LXHFMW", "B0000C9JFO", "B0001CNQX0", "B00004U1FA", "B00E1S1MMM", "B007961SAE", "B000GETTJI", "B004IF4EVY", "B00F6Y3E26", "B0032AJVE6", "B003O3EKRO", "B003X3BYJM", "B0009HLC9W", "B0000714BS", "B00000F5KH", "B002VECLXC", "B0000714BQ", "B0009S4IGK", "B002FUI4CE", "B00006BS7S", "B00APUAKYG", "B000K2V7F0", "B000SLYE6M", "0764146076", "B0000A2ZTY", "B0002VEZ3U", "1444137697", "B001M5BF7Y", "B000KJU15U", "B001Q56XOA", "B001QX014A", "0070020698", "B001S400C0", "B000VXUW0E", "B00H1RMPH6", "B000QYKDFC", "B000067IZ3", "B000JBXH78", "B00IQIAL8Y", "B007L6VPXC", "B0051T46YG", "B0002DRDIW", "B002EZLPOO", "B000N3T0DM", "B0002RQ316", "B0000U0X20", "B0013HL6ES"], "bought_together": ["B000O76ZQC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00180IPM6", "B0036TGSJE", "B005HFI7IU", "B000O76ZQC"]}, "price": 4.09, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 3577}, "asin": "B0002TT0MI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51o4PdGtr3L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Maria Full of Grace"}

{"description": "VCI is very pleased to present this epic motion picture, which has been mastered from the original negatives and presented in all its widescreen glory for the first time on home video! Love and war intertwine in this fanciful adaptation of history. The brilliant Carthaginian general, Hannibal (Victor Mature) despises Rome. Fueled by vengeance, he drives his army of elephants through the treacherous, frozen Alps into Italy, crushing anyone who dared to oppose him. As a strategy to break the morale of his enemies, Hannibal captures the beautiful Sylvia of Rome (Rita Gam) so she may see the might of his army and spread the news of impending doom to her people. However, a love grows between the two that will eventually be his undoing. This big-budget spectacle produced by Warner Bros. was shot in Technicolor and SuperCinescope and literally features a cast of thousands... over 4,000 foot-soldiers, 1,500 horsemen, 45 elephants and a vast assortment of war machines were employed in the historic battle of Cannae alone.Bonus Features:Anamorphic Widescreen Enhanced for 16 x 9 Monitors, Photo & Poster Gallery, Original Theatrical Trailer, Bios, Scene Selection Menu.Specs:DVD9; Dolby Digital Mono; 100 minutes; Color; 2.35:1 Aspect Ratio; MPAA - NR; Year - 1960; SRP - $14.99.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001DZOCY6", "B000056AXZ", "B00ALTQRUC", "B000F9SUT4", "B00125WAXM", "B001AD8FXK", "B000OHZJGE", "B008NNY8CW", "B000095WW6", "B00005JN8Z", "B0037JO0X4", "B0044X1Y0E", "B008NNY8BS", "B004H0M31I", "B0006GANX2", "B0044O1Q60", "B00007AJF4", "B008NNY8IG", "B0002KPHW4", "B000WMFZMY", "B00AGKHF1G", "B001LNOMJ0", "B006DHATAK", "B00CLF80KE", "B0001NBMEE", "B0006OBPZY", "B001NSLE5I", "B003EYVXXW", "B0000B1A58", "B005DSGD7S", "B00006AUGK", "B00AEFXFW6", "B000062XF2", "B0010YSDAE", "B008FYZI6E", "B000EXDSBQ", "B00KIZYDCI", "B004X1Z14C", "B00005LKHN", "B00005V1WY", "B000065VVG", "B00108FMFO", "B000MTFFR2", "B006H3KQKI", "B00005JMH8", "B000KJU18C", "B000CNE0M4", "B00CV1PG32", "B0009UVCR6", "B000AJJNLI", "B000OHZJJ6", "0783226039", "B0001NBMDK", "B00IIO9G28", "B0006D3HDI", "B000A1OFZK", "B000CNE0JW", "B000E8JO32", "B00JF5GAZA", "B00GMV8GL6", "B001LX4BU0", "B00D6I7ITY", "B00005QJJG", "B0006B2A7E", "B000ND91WW", "B000BZISSU", "B002AT8KBU", "B0016LFG2Y", "B00H7BJ128", "B00IJE1CWE", "B000S0KYTE", "B00406UK7S", "B009DH379M", "B008A1TXB8", "B00JBGSHSQ", "B001AD8FR6", "B00HS6DTTS", "B00A1AU5Z4", "B003ZFXE82", "B000062XF0", "B008RNYMM4", "B00018D3ZA", "B000034DE2", "B00553K8PE", "B00HW3L61U", "B000YDMPBU", "B0016LFG4M", "B002NPCJTK", "B006JY3OHW", "B0096PBCFC", "B0002S93TO", "B000MGB6NM", "B000EHSVJ6", "B000BVM1RS", "B00A92MFQG", "B00D9EJFV4", "B001BSBBIA", "B00BQ7GU1Y", "B0000EYUCK"], "bought_together": ["B00ALTQRUC", "B000056AXZ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00125WAXM", "B000056AXZ", "B000065VVG", "B001NSLE5I"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 99003}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.58, "brand": "VIDEO COMMUNICATIONS INC.", "asin": "B0002VEU4O", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51YX15BTEML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Hannibal"}

{"description": "The bonus material is comprised of nine 4-6 minutes featurettes on various aspects of the production, giving insight on how the selection of director Paul Greengrass--with his documentary, impromptu methods--led to the film's much-talked-about style. The most interesting are about how they blow up things (without a computer) and a look at the Go Mobile, a new rig to capture a car chase on film. Even though it's not listed on the packaging, there is a commentary track with the director (uninteresting as it is). Something that is listed on the package, \"Explosive Deleted Scenes,\" is really about 7 minutes of ho-hum expository scenes. Note: the frantic, hand-held camera work in the film makes it hard to view on the small screen, especially on the full-screen edition.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000VWYJ86", "B00023B1LC", "B005LAIIPS", "B002ZG97RE", "B000W1V5VU", "B0000B1OFL", "B000EGDB10", "B0007P0XBO", "B000P0J0BK", "B001TODCII", "B000QEIOTO", "B002ZHKZD8", "B00AEBB86A", "B002ZHKZCO", "B003QO8TOQ", "B0002VEUV2", "B00AQSN7HE", "B007REV4T8", "B004EPYZUS", "B003Q6D2B4", "B000HRMAPE", "B00121QGPY", "B00AEFXYJA", "B00005JNJV", "B00005JL5F", "B001PPLIEG", "B00429C1TI", "B004SIP7ZS", "B00005JM5E", "B000AYELVU", "B0021L8V0M", "B00005JN5E", "B00008G8M4", "B005LAIGRS", "B00005JN2Z", "6305428115", "B002GSXKP6", "B00008AOVL", "B000P0J0AQ", "B002XMGGK6", "B0046BI81W", "B00AEFY5B6", "B004LWZWGA", "B00BUAEYVK", "B00005JLSB", "B001GZ6QC4", "B00AS1Q93S", "B002T9H2LA", "B008JFURII", "B000I0RQVI", "B00151QYCQ", "B000M341QE", "B002HWRYJE", "B0002HOEC6", "B000F6IOC0", "B003L20IG0", "B0067EKYAY", "B00005JKYX", "B005LAIIQC", "B000U7WV1Y", "B00E5I2MCM", "B004A8ZX28", "B007K3JFUQ", "B005LAIGLE", "B0002V7OI8", "B000RPCK1U", "B00005B6JZ", "B00DSDUVFK", "B00004Z4WR", "B001OQCV6A", "B0000VAFO0", "B005PTYP70", "B00E5I2M6I", "B00AEFY0F2", "B003AWRMCE", "B00005JOC9", "B003ASLJRC", "B003ASLJIQ", "B0007KIFGE", "B000YGDNPO", "B00016MSV2", "B00001ZWUS", "B0004Z33EG", "B00004STUL", "B0000897EG", "B004EPYZP8", "B000MXPE7O", "B00012QLB4", "B004LWZW42", "B001QB9H10", "B001QTXM5Y", "B000GFLKF8", "B001GCUO1Q", "B00AZMFJYA", "B001HN697M", "B000W9DTG6", "B00003CXC5", "B0007WFX62", "B000R9U3B0", "B001TK80C0"], "bought_together": ["B000VWYJ86", "B00023B1LC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001F12J0C", "B000VWYJ86", "B005LAIIPS", "B00023B1LC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 16071}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.95, "brand": "Universal Studios", "asin": "B0002ZDVEU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51H2QD8RJ8L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Bourne Supremacy (Widescreen Edition)"}

It's still Twain's show all the way, though, as she sings lead for every song, including \"I'm Gonna Getcha Good,\" \"You're Still the One,\" and a cover of \"You Shook Me All Night Long,\" which her husband Mutt Lange produced for AC/DC many moons ago.  Dressed in relatively conservative black leather (!) and forgoing the aerobics, step dancers, and other pyrotechnics of older shows, Twain is personable and chatty with the audience that surrounds the stage (though no one is invited up), so much so that she can only get through 12 songs in the hourlong show.

{"description": "The remarkable first season ofDeadwoodrepresents one of those periodic, wholesale reinventions of the Western that is as different from, say,Lonesome Doveas that miniseries is from Howard Hawks'sRio Bravoor the latter is from Anthony Mann'sThe Naked Spur. In many ways, HBO'sDeadwoodembraces the Western's unambiguous morality during the cinema's silent era through the 1930s while also blazing trails through a post-NYPD Blue, post-The West Wingtelevision age exalting dense and customized dialogue. On top of that,Deadwoodhas managed an original look and texture for a familiar genre: gritty, chaotic, and surging with both dark and hopeful energy. Yet the show's creator, erstwhileNYPD Bluehead writer David Milch, never ridicules or condescends to his more grasping, futile characters or overstates the virtues of his heroic ones.Set in an ungoverned stretch of South Dakota soon after the 1876 Custer massacre,Deadwoodconcerns a lawless, evolving town attracting fortune-seekers, drifters, tyrants, and burned-out adventurers searching for a card game and a place to die. Others, particularly women trapped in prostitution, sundry do-gooders, and hangers-on have nowhere else to go. Into this pool of aspiration and nightmare arrive former Montana lawman Seth Bullock (Timothy Olyphant) and his friend Sol Starr (John Hawkes), determined to open a lucrative hardware business. Over time, their paths cross with a weary but still formidable Wild Bill Hickok (Keith Carradine) and his doting companion, the coarse angel Calamity Jane (Robin Weigert); an aristocratic, drug-addicted widow (Molly Parker) trying to salvage a gold mining claim; and a despondent hooker (Paula Malcomson) who cares, briefly, for an orphaned girl. Casting a giant shadow over all is a blood-soaked king, Gem Saloon owner Al Swearengen (Ian McShane), possibly the best, most complex, and mesmerizing villain seen on TV in years.  Over 12 episodes, each of these characters, and many others, will forge alliances and feuds, cope with disasters (such as smallpox), and move--almost invisibly but inexorably--toward some semblance of order and common cause. Making it all worthwhile is Milch's masterful dialogue--often profane, sometimes courtly and civilized, never perfunctory--and the brilliant acting of the aforementioned performers plus Brad Dourif, Leon Rippy, Powers Boothe, and Kim Dickens.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000EULSR0", "B000NVI2GU", "B0038M2APA", "B0075FF5QM", "B007A2Z3Y4", "B00B5J6A7W", "B004HW7JNS", "B00CG4XKNM", "B004BZ5AHI", "B00EAPC860", "B00HUCF420", "B00A2JOQMW", "B003Y5HWJU", "B008PJZDXW", "B0028RXXE8", "B00076YPUI", "B00HT850YW", "B00CDTSFF8", "B00J5LXT44", "B00BFAIH68", "B00G4RDQK4", "B002UJIY7A", "1596912391", "B00BC5I6Q2", "B00316DDUO", "B00C8CQRQ4", "B00ECGHM5O", "B000K2V7E6", "B0090XO59U", "B00EIXWW2O", "B005LAJ1H2", "B00HW3EXCE", "B00EEDNR9A", "B0012RLX88", "B00EUI4XHE", "B004QRUN96", "B00J5G1P2W", "B00003CXOP", "B00AATGDUC", "B00IARA8KM", "B009LDD54K", "B000PGTPH8", "B008CLI4N4", "B008V9HKF0", "B00ATP24V4", "6305504024", "B002N57KGM", "B005HAAZLC", "B00G0B7PTW", "B001TH8ZH8", "B000059H7K", "080328702X", "B001FA1OTU", "B0051GOB2G", "B00BVMXBDO", "B0060MYKYY", "B00911L7VA", "B00BQ42Q38", "B00GWJIDFW", "B001DJLCRC", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B0002ERXC2", "B000VWX6T4", "B008BLCP0S", "B00FEP9MYG", "B00GAHJO8G", "B00793J278", "B0002J4X2K", "B00005JL3K", "B00J4LMHMK", "B000YABIQ6", "6304711905", "B0058YPG1G", "B001FB4W0W", "B003PIUBZS", "B00DJYJRHG", "B004HW7JO2", "B001RTSPVY", "B00HEPE6MM", "B00CL151G4", "B00005NOHO", "B0024FAR5M", "B00AYNG9BC", "B0032UYFA6", "B009ERK2UI", "B000BO7DWI", "B000F1IQI2", "B00915G6WQ", "B0081QF6Q8", "B00B5J5YJM", "B00IWTVDUW", "B006MK4QKW", "B00ECHBSP8", "B009LDD1H6", "B0012CJQYQ", "B00BGI076M", "B001GCUER0", "B002FLOTPE", "B005FISBTO", "B0032JTV6A"], "bought_together": ["B000EULSR0", "B000NVI2GU"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001FA1OTU", "B000EULSR0", "B0038M2APA", "B000NVI2GU"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 6874}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 34.99, "brand": "Warner Bros", "asin": "B0006FO5LO", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61KQUt8dAdL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Deadwood: Season 1"}

{"description": "Dave Chappelle's shrewd parodies, stinging satires, and boldly imaginative fantasias simply pour from the second season of his Comedy Central show, in every respect as funny as his well-received debut year. The structure is the same: a relaxed Chappelle introduces each sketch to an enthusiastic, studio audience (some of these introductions amount to stand-up routines), and then the madness begins. Among the many highlights from the 13 episodes on this boxed set's three discs is a mock ad for Samuel L. Jackson beer, featuring Chappelle's hilarious impression of Jackson's stern, overbearing persona fromPulp Fiction, and a dozen other features. Chappelle, considering a career in politics, floats a couple of trial campaign commercials, including one that promises to solve America's health care crisis by giving every citizen a fake Canadian I.D. Chappelle also suggests an effective program for teaching sexual abstinence to high school students: Forcing them to watch their principals have sex with the oldest female teachers on staff.There's a good bit, too, about black soothsayer Negrodamus, whose ability to foresee events is limited to the fortunes of celebrities. Coming under fire (amusingly) are those McDonald's commercials suggesting that burger-flipping employment for African Americans can overhaul inner city communities. But, as with season 1, there are several masterpieces in this collection as well, such as Chappelle's vision of what the Internet would look like if it was a place you could actually, physically visit (with the equivalents of pop-up ads, porn sites, etc.). Equally inspired is a sketch in which a freeloading Chappelle, having impregnated the ultra-rich Oprah Winfrey, indulges his every whim. Best of all is Chappelle's take on what President Bush's administration would look like if the Chief Executive were, in fact, a black man.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00018YCIM", "B000FZETIE", "B000095J1K", "B000O59A2A", "B0009VRHLU", "B000FMH8RG", "B0016KCCCM", "B0036TGTEI", "B0006HBZE2", "B000F8O2QK", "B000CNESLM", "B008FRJDVC", "B000H6SY32", "B000LV6VYW", "B0008KLV96", "B008F282QO", "1558908390", "B0041QSZS8", "B000EMGJAO", "B001DJLD0S", "B002XUBDXS", "B002OOK6WM", "B000F48D14", "B00AEFYE08", "B0001XAODE", "B00008PHCU", "B002LCOGBE", "B0006N2F04", "B004P7CMZ0", "B00005JLG1", "B000P5FH5S", "B00ANDDBBY", "B000UAE7Q8", "B00AMSM9AO", "B000AJJNI6", "B00024JC4E", "B0056EBHEI", "B000GPIPTM", "0783237367", "B000CNESM6", "B0000YEE6M", "B004SIP6LS", "B001EOQVA4", "0767830555", "B001HB1K0A", "B00023P49C", "B004SIP93S", "B002N1AEWS", "B000FFJYC0", "B008FXLZ6W", "B002C7ELWC", "B000EBGFPY", "B0019L0ACM", "B00J5LXPPM", "B000OIOOVE", "B001O0TWXG", "B000022TSW", "B002N5N5NE", "B0018BDDF4", "B00006HAVX", "B002OID4WM", "B00BTYPWDQ", "B00005JNEQ", "B000BITV9W", "B001J4E1C4", "B0008JIJ1A", "B00BTYFWEA", "B002CA68N4", "B000ENUYGI", "0792838076", "B001J9KJ4I", "B000B5XOR0", "B0016LFG4M", "B008412UQ4", "B0006Z2L2Y", "B000RPD0DC", "B001BGS17G", "B00023P49M", "B0018O5WUU", "B000084T18", "B0021TVYCG", "630514415X", "B000WZEZGI", "B000C20VRS", "B0030Y11UG", "B0001ZWLVU", "B006W93ELK", "B00005JLEX", "B00005N89M", "B00005JD5H", "B000ADWCYY", "B0000A98ZO", "B004SIP9E2", "B0002UE1WQ", "B000WPNL8Q", "B00AIANIPQ", "B000FSME2Y", "B0025X4PBK", "B0000696I2"], "bought_together": ["B00018YCIM", "B000FZETIE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B008FRJDVC", "B00018YCIM", "B000O59A2A", "B000FZETIE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 16600}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 10.75, "brand": "Paramount", "asin": "B0006Q93CO", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51B5Z142P1L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Chappelle's Show - Season 2"}

{"description": "The broadcast seriesScrapped Princess(2003) gives new meaning to the term \"anti-hero.\" Pacifica Cassul was born under a baleful star: according to the prophecy she's the poison that will cause the end of the world on her 16th birthday. As the fatal day approaches, she's on the lam with her older brother and sister, Shannon and Raquel. They're charged with protecting her from worshippers of the god Mauser, who believe in the prophecy. Pacifica isn't the  most likable character: she fusses and whines and sticks her siblings with all the work. The filmmakers try to balance her petulance with mawkish scenes of doubt and self-pity. The villains multiply in Ichiro Sakaki's story until it's not clear just who's out to get Pacifica. Despite its shortcomings,Scrapped Princessscored a big hit in Japan and may well prove popular in America.

{"description": "Of all the \"re-imagining\" wreaked upon the Hanna-Barbera animated  catalog by Cartoon Network's Adult Swim programs,Harvey Birdman:  Attorney at Lawis probably their most deliriously creative effort.  The series revives second-string '60s avian heroBirdman, and  via a combination of old clips and new animation, recasts him as a  crusading lawyer (voiced by Gary Cole) who defends the rights of other  cartoon characters. That Harvey is pitted in the courtroom against old  supervillain foes, who have followed his lead and become prosecutors  and judges, is one problem--but even more challenging are the pickles  his fellow Hanna-Barbera creations find themselves in: Harvey must  clear Fred Flintstone of organized crime charges (\"The Dabba Don,\"  perhaps the first season's most clever episode); prove that Boo Boo is  not the notorious bomber known as the \"Unabooboo\" (\"Death by  Chocolate\"); and on a more personal note, contend with an addiction to  self-tanning cream (\"SPF\").   Obviously,Harvey Birdman's humor  isn't for every viewer, but for those with a taste for the offbeat, the  frequently hilarious scripts (mostly by show creators Michael Ouweleen  and Eric Richter) and terrific vocal performances by Cole, Stephen  Colbert (as evil prosecutor Reducto) and John Michael Higgins's Judge  Mentok the Mind-Taker (as well as guests like Michael McKean,Spongebob Squarepants' Tom Kenny, and Peter MacNicol) make the  show a cracked delight.Volume 1's two-disc set compiles all nine episodes of the first  season and four from season 2 (the episodes are presented in order of  production--\"Blackwatch Plaid\" is not included here); extras include  deleted scenes, a faux movie trailer, and commentary by Ouweleen,  Richter, and director Richard Ferguson-Hull on five episodes, with the  option on \"The Dabba Don\" to also hear representatives from the  network's legal and Standards and Practices departments comment on the  validity of Harvey's legal decisions.--Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000GIXLWA", "B000PAAJZG", "B0001MZ7K0", "B00069L0Z4", "B00097DY2U", "B000FO0AG0", "B0000AQS89", "B0002WZRTU", "B0007CILMK", "B00116GEKW", "B001G7Q640", "B00069L0YU", "B000FO0AFQ", "B000EMGIDC", "B000KWZ1PC", "B000M7XRC4", "B000ABKHZC", "B001NOMO2Y", "B00466HOR6", "B00GSSD73K", "B003VVBZ7W", "B0000AQS81", "B00008EY6Q", "B000ARXF7I", "B0001MZ7KA", "B0002WZRSG", "B002VWNIDQ", "B000B5XOR0", "B002GSXKRO", "B00LBHOCHS", "B003H0ZHLW", "B000VWX6SA", "B001J4E1C4", "B00113YHXG", "B003NF97NU", "B0002YCVY2", "B004L9GLM2", "B00466HORQ", "B003BV8I9K", "B007CO5MVE", "B00267N3EU", "B000M341RS", "B000E0OE3K", "B001NOMO38", "B004QLX0TM", "B00330WP6Q", "B000P2A6CA", "B000RPD0DC", "B001EOQVA4", "B005Y1ZU6Y", "B00BTRKMNI", "B0056EBHEI", "B00GUALJUO", "B000OY9V7K", "B00C6QT4CQ", "B001DZOD7C", "B0081QCZGC", "B0069R250G", "B00005JPP2", "B00475B0G2", "B00006IGVK", "B001P7YD7S", "B0007GADU4", "B000FZETX4", "B001BGS17G", "B00080ZFYS", "B002N1AEWS", "B000S76LKI", "B003W5TO70", "B00H3JJCW8", "B008KHJJ9I", "B0036TGTEI", "B00KVRK39A", "B002ZXZJ1A", "B0002NY8XA", "B00AIANIPQ", "B005CHTXWC", "B0017INRG8", "B000AXWX70", "B000FS6JCK", "B000F8O2QK", "B000VIWTL4", "B001G0MFFG", "B0019N8P2W", "B00ICR6SBI", "B000FSME2Y", "B00GOFVED2", "B00K8HAJN8", "B00023P49C", "B004U7MQW4", "B0007WFUGA", "B000EQ5PT6", "B000FI9OEU", "B00DNQCH0Y", "B000E6ES9O", "B005LAJ18G", "B0048LPRDC", "B000KLQUMQ", "B007KFZ8B4", "B000G0O596"], "bought_together": ["B000GIXLWA", "B000PAAJZG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0017RFXJI", "B0001MZ7K0", "B00069L0Z4", "B000GIXLWA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 41378}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 10.32, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B0007CILMA", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61GJ4MZPN4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law, Vol. 1"}

{"description": "From Hollywood's legendary Cocoanut Grove to the pioneering conquest of the wild blue yonder, Martin Scorsese'sThe Aviatorcelebrates old-school filmmaking at its finest. We say \"old school\" only because Scorsese's love of golden-age Hollywood is evident in his approach to his subject--Howard Hughes in his prime (played by Leonardo DiCaprio in his)--and especially in his technical mastery of the medium reflecting his love for classical filmmaking of the studio era. Even when he's using state-of-the-art digital trickery for the film's exciting flight scenes (including one of the most spectacular crashes ever filmed), Scorsese's meticulous attention to art direction and costume design suggests an impassioned pursuit of craftsmanship from a bygone era; every frame seems to glow with gilded detail. And while DiCaprio bears little physical resemblance to Hughes during the film's 20-year span (late 1920s to late '40s), he efficiently captures the eccentric millionaire's golden-boy essence, and his tragic descent into obsessive-compulsive seclusion. Bolstered by Cate Blanchett's uncannily accurate portrayal of Katharine Hepburn as Hughes' most beloved lover,The Aviatoris easily Scorsese's most accessible film, inviting mainstream popularity without compromising Scorsese's artistic reputation. As compelling crowd-pleasers go, it's a class act from start to finish.--Jeff ShannonDVD FeaturesIn his commentary track, director Martin Scorsese offers his own impressions of Howard Hughes and rattles off his memories of experiencing Hughes's films.  He mentions how he made Cate Blanchett watch every Katharine Hepburn film from the '30s on the big screen, and observes that Kate Beckinsale had \"a real sense of the stature of a Hollywood goddess.\"  But in general he doesn't talk much about the craft of making the film.  That area is covered better by editor Thelma Schoonmaker, who also appears on the commentary track, and producer Michael Mann makes a few appearances (all were recorded separately).  The picture is brilliant, but the 5.1 sound is not as aggressive in the rear speakers and subwoofer as one might expect, other than some nice surround effects in theHell's Angelsflying sequence.The second disc collects almost three hours of features.  There's one unnecessary deleted scene, and an 11-minute making-of featurette that's basically the cast and director heaping praise on each other.  More interesting are the short featurettes on visual effects (including the XF-11 scene, of course), production design, costumes, hair and makeup, and score, and Loudon Wainwright discusses his and his children's musical performances.  Historical perspective is provided by spotlights on Hughes's role in aviation and his obsessive-compulsive disorder, and a 43-minute Hughes documentary from the History Channel (part of the Modern Marvels series, it focuses on his mechanical innovations and spends less than a minute on his movies).  More unusual are DiCaprio and Scorsese's appearance on an OCD panel, and a half-hour interview segment DiCaprio did with Alan Alda.--David HoriuchiThe Personalities ofThe AviatorClick the links to explore more movies by these stars.Leonardo DiCaprioasHoward Hughes\"Sometimes I truly fear that I... am losing my mind.

With its 16 well-chosen songs, largely culled from Williams's most rewarding material since the 1980s,Liveis indispensable for longtime fans and a great introduction to her unique artistry for the uninitiated. Williams's deceptively plain-spoken, sometimes conversational lyrics about losses and passages and elusive touchstones of happiness are marvels of instant resonance, transcending minimalist imagery and fragmentary refrains. Surrounded by a small, guitar army and sometimes hypnotic rhythm section, Williams fills out \"Metal Firecracker\" with a vintage folk-rock sound, raises the extraordinary \"Drunken Angel\" and \"Greenville\" to new heights, and delivers--with a voice as lovely as a bell--a stirring performance on \"Sweet Old World.\" Lest we forget her appreciation of the Doors, \"Joy\" brings the show to a head with its gritty, shamanic blues and evocative promises (\"I'm gonna go to West Memphis and find my joy\") that make one want to jump with excitement.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001F3ESG8", "B00GJNQ40W", "B000007Q8J", "B000001A3J", "B004HGBUVG", "B000LXHGFI", "B000641A2C", "B001DXF9JU", "B000001DFT", "B000001DI6", "B000089RV5", "B00005B8GS", "B00JQHOF72", "B00JTNTOR4", "B000B9EYJS", "B00KF1CWF0", "B00064VQYO", "B00005PJOI", "B00FZRMIYY", "B00J8JQ6D4", "B00JFBCDD2", "B000B9EYKM", "B00JBV28NQ", "B00ILAWJLO", "B00HQI823Q", "B000083C7Z", "B004FRVE18", "B00IIT0CHG", "B00GSGT7G8", "B00GV8B0FO", "B00IKM5NZC", "B000KJU1HI", "B00FCAK33C", "B000E1XOJY", "B00IGGAEW4", "B00DNJ99F2", "B00HNTUR1S", "B00J5364N0", "B00IPL286U", "B00G34XP3Q", "B00HQI7VMY", "B00FLDG52I", "B00INXSJ22", "B000FVGNPA", "B000S6LT4W", "B00DVT55QQ", "B00I89Y2SQ", "B001CT05KI", "B005JT631W", "B00064VQYE", "B00I3TWZ9Y", "B00E5MIMHW", "B00BYM5I1O", "B00H3JHE0K", "B00081928C", "B00IK7NC9G", "B001COVD1I", "B00E1LRCY6", "B000E1XOL2", "B00IBQ5NIO", "B00IPL2BCQ", "B00AKV1K9O", "B00AQ6J3HO", "B00GRHVIGU", "B00EV5I886", "B00026WU50", "B0090O07RS", "B00000F2L9", "B00HAWRKVI", "B00GUXO12O", "B00006H33G", "B00B08FLVO", "B000F4RHUM", "B000JBXHWI", "B0009J2RR6", "B003LS3PIC", "B00E0P8VQQ", "B000LC5B3S", "B00064VQZS", "B00HX5PPPU", "B0000A02WW", "B00ANMAJUQ", "B000077VP2", "B000777I74", "B005R963JQ", "B000NY17J6", "B00CCEHQJU", "B008DL472K", "B000F48D00", "B00ED2EMJQ", "B000FGG738", "B000VLOKQI", "B0062U29Y2", "B0011XFOGU", "B000160YYA", "B000FG65SA", "B0062Y9DCY", "0143104934", "B002F3BP1I", "B001RTP3Z0"], "bought_together": ["B001F3ESG8", "B00GJNQ40W"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00GJNQ40W", "B001F3ESG8", "B000007Q8J", "B000641A2C"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 62615}, "categories": [["CDs & Vinyl", "Country", "Americana"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Folk", "Contemporary Folk"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Pop", "Singer-Songwriters"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Pop", "Vocal Pop"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Rock"], ["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 15.9, "brand": "PBS", "asin": "B00081928M", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31nULerH%2BbL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Lucinda Williams - Live from Austin, TX"}
{"description": "This restoration of Sam Peckinpah's 1965 westernMajor Dundeeis nothing short of magnificent, a noble attempt at restoring a famously wrecked masterpiece. When Peckinpah went over budget and over schedule during the Mexico shoot, unshot scenes were canceled and the footage rudely cut by the studio. The director disowned the results. In 2005, surviving footage was patched back in, and a new musical soundtrack commissioned to replace the score Peckinpah hated. This raises some legitimate questions about interpreting a director's intentions, and about messing with film history, butMajor Dundee--The Extended Versionis such a rousing, mysterious experience, one feels grateful.Major Dundee (Charlton Heston) is a vainglorious officer busted to the decidedly inglorious job of overseeing prisoners in a fort in New Mexico. An abduction gives him the excuse to mount an expedition into Mexico, chasing the perpetrators and perhaps a shot at greatness. His ragtag posse includes Confederate POWs, notably one Captain Ben Tyreen (Richard Harris), whose intense former friendship with Dundee is tainted with a sense of betrayal on both sides. (Heston and Harris, two actors not known for subtlety, are splendid.) Part Ahab, part Alexander the Great, Dundee leads the expedition away from its purpose and into a near-mythic kind of wandering.Peckinpah gets everything right--the landscapes, the sneaky humor, the code of men. He also takes time to distinguish the supporting characters, such as Jim Hutton's awkward young officer and Senta Berger's stranded widow. The Peckinpah stock company of amazing character actors is in place, too, including James Coburn, Warren Oates, Ben Johnson, L.Q. Jones, and Slim Pickens. It will never be exactly what Peckinpah envisioned, but nowMajor Dundeerides suspiciously close to greatness.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00108FMFO", "B00AEBB8W4", "B000062XF0", "B0007MAO0C", "B000BT96DM", "B00AEFXFW6", "B00000K3D5", "B000BT96DW", "B0045HCJTO", "B0006TPDPM", "B000054OV4", "B000WMFZMY", "B00782O7UM", "B00195I3OK", "B000E5N63Y", "B00AEFYPHA", "B000OT6V0U", "B000QRI1GW", "B0007PALJS", "B0001GF2JC", "B000EHSVVY", "B00004TJJU", "B000095WW6", "B000G6N0HI", "B0009UVCR6", "B00012FX4K", "B000BT96DC", "B000EHSVW8", "B0046OKF5G", "B000EHSVWS", "B000NQRR34", "0792840453", "B0008ENHUS", "B000059TFU", "B0000EYUCK", "B00006672R", "B00BTYSIV4", "B0008ENHTY", "B00083FZFE", "B0007PALM0", "B000EHSVUU", "B000FTCLQW", "B00008PC13", "B0007PALKC", "B00008MTW7", "B003RHZ666", "B00096S4B2", "B000031EGW", "B0014BQR1A", "B004XWGZK0", "B000O78L00", "B00K6D1QEK", "B0007OY2OY", "6304696612", "B000062XEX", "B0016LFG2Y", "B0006GANX2", "B000KJU18C", "B002A5HF6K", "B0001AVZBW", "B00008MTW5", "B000E5N6KW", "B0050MB5N4", "B00AEFYSEA", "B000O599NK", "B0001Z3I0I", "B0001FVDWS", "B0015S2OWI", "B0042RJWTM", "B004H0M2UA", "B00008CMR1", "0792841662", "B000MV90B2", "B000N3T0GY", "B00096S4BM", "B003B3O5HM", "B000HEVZ76", "B00005BI96", "B000O599NA", "B00005LOL2", "B0006B2A6U", "B000EHSVSW", "B008JEJSB6", "B00005JLV5", "B000056H2H", "B004H0M31I", "B000A2WJBQ", "B009AGEWKE", "B0036BDQ7Y", "B000AQ6A0I", "B0009UVCQW", "B000Q6GX90", "B00049QQJQ", "B000056H2K", "B00CHYSSME", "B00005YUNT", "B006H3KQKI", "B00I5NKPW2", "B00018D404", "B0002KPHZG"], "bought_together": ["B00108FMFO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00108FMFO", "B000062XF0", "B00AEFYSEA", "B00005YUNT"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 22611}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 13.5, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B00083FZFY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/512E92HCYNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Major Dundee (The Extended Version)"}
{"description": "Unlike the recentTenchi Muyo GXP, which only alluded to the original characters, the OVARyo-Ohkibrings back the gang from the popular comedy-adventure. The always transitory calm of the Masaki household is shattered when new visitors arrive from the planet Jurai. They include Tenchi's older sister Tennyo; Airi, the wife of Tenchi's grandfather; and Noiki, Tenchi's fianc&#xE9;e, chosen for him by Ayeka's and Sasami's grandmother Lady Seto (a.k.a. the Devil Princess of Jurai). But these plot twists are largely artifice: more is going on than meets the eye--as is often the case inTenchistories.The OVA reunites not only Tenchi, Ayeka, Sasami, Washu, Ryoko, Nobuyuki, and Katsuhiko, but key members of the English vocal cast: Matt K. Miller (Tenchi), Jennifer Darling (Ayeka), and Sherry Lynn (Sasami). Celeste Burch replaces Petrea Burchard as Ryoko, and Mihoshi's long-suffering partner Kiyone seems to be missing in action. Although there are a few inconsistencies and a lot of clips from the originalTenchi Muyo!(1992), the new shows are quite entertaining. LikeHello Dolly,Tenchican apparently be revived endlessly.

{"description": "Driven by intelligent, constantly surprising and moving performances from the film's leads,Dear Frankiestars Emily Mortimer (Lovely and Amazing) as Lizzie, Scottish mother of Frankie (Jack McElhone), a deaf and highly intelligent 9-year-old. Constantly uprooting themselves and relocating from town to town, Lizzie and Frankie are on the run from the latter's abusive father, a fact unknown to the boy, who believes his dad is a busy seaman sending letters full of adventure and love. In fact, Lizzie is writing those missives, but she is faced with a challenge when Frankie discovers his father's ship will dock nearby. Lizzie hires a kind, handsome stranger (Gerard Butler) to play Frankie's dad, creating an odd situation in which ever-growing lies become a conduit for love, and Lizzie's repressed desires come to the fore with a man posing as her husband. The moral tangles are of interest in director Shona Auerbach's charmingly paced, quietly insightful drama-comedy, but so is the glorious feeling of watching these characters come fully alive.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00A2H9UG6", "B000GIXEIG", "B005FITIDC", "B00027NVXE", "B00007AJF4", "B000WP07F6", "B002ZG998G", "B002P413IC", "B000G8P1Y6", "B000YAA68C", "B000V8VNUM", "B00AEBB8QK", "B001M4YZ90", "B0059XTUR2", "B00AAQHP66", "B00003CXSD", "B001D7WF98", "B002XMGGK6", "B002SG7Z7A", "B004R6VHQY", "B004XYOQU4", "B001APZMJS", "B00009XN4C", "B00AEFYGBA", "B000FQISV2", "B00094AS9U", "B0007TKNII", "B0038N9X3Q", "B00BEIYHO2", "B00946G2YE", "B000OY9V8Y", "B00A2H9VBU", "B005FITIF0", "B003LL3FIY", "B000811672", "B00006JDVV", "B00008DDVT", "B005CFC0HE", "B00GSBMNOQ", "B000XS3WWW", "B004IY6A0S", "B00GPWEPZ8", "B00G15MDI0", "B00CBK6506", "B001APZMJ8", "B00006JU8B", "B000QXDED6", "B004SIP7PS", "B0000714BW", "B007A2O3FO", "B007K7IBTI", "B003HDYOTU", "B000GYI048", "B0000C2IR4", "B0009A1BW2", "B000A2W1X2", "B0015GDVTU", "B000NJWIPI", "0767020308", "B0009UZGIM", "B003SC9AVC", "B00EOHGQPI", "B00AQTY3XA", "B000654YWY", "B00AZMFO6I", "B000NVT0T8", "B002OVED88", "B0009G3BCY", "B00FZ4KR4U", "B0059XTUT0", "B0067EKY7M", "B00006ZXSO", "B0000UJLTG", "B0053Q9DHW", "B0002W18RU", "B00G7QPXAI", "B000HRMATU", "B00DL48BM6", "B00G6HO368", "B004SIP6BI", "B00BEIYGK2", "B000Z27HLS", "B002ZG988M", "B00104AYFQ", "B0040J1RZE", "B005S9EJ14", "B000P5FH26", "B000JLQQ7Q", "B00005JPSM", "B005PTMPYA", "B00GST8LMG", "B004KDYQXU", "B008N25XAE", "B000VKL6T8", "6305558205", "B0002V7S34", "B00008HC9B", "B000IJ7A24", "B00JAQJMJ0"], "bought_together": ["B00A2H9UG6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0007TKNII", "B00A2H9UG6", "B001APZMJS", "B000YAA68C"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 17921}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.14, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B00094AS9A", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51igVNYqynL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Dear Frankie"}
{"description": "Will Smith's easygoing charm makesHitchthe kind of pleasant, uplifting romantic comedy that you could recommend to almost anyone--especially if there's romance in the air. As suave Manhattan dating consultant Alex \"Hitch\" Hitchens, Smith plays up the smoother, sophisticated side of his established screen persona as he mentors a pudgy accountant (Kevin James) on the lessons of love. The joke, of course, is that Hitch's own love life is a mess, and as he coaches James toward romance with a rich, powerful, and seemingly inaccessible beauty named Allegra (Amber Valetta), he's trying too hard to impress a savvy gossip columnist (Eva Mendes) with whom he's fallen in love. Through mistaken identities and mismatched couples, director Andy Tennant brings the same light touch that made Drew Barrymore'sEver Afterso effortlessly engaging. As romantic comedies go,Hitchdoesn't offer any big surprises, but as a date movie it gets the job done with amiable ease and style.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0009RCPUW", "B001QERPAC", "B0013J55B6", "B000N6U0E2", "B0001Z3TXE", "B00005JN0T", "B0013FDM7E", "B00AEFY99O", "B003Y5H4ZW", "B000VXWX7E", "B002K0WBXW", "B000803BQC", "B000BKVQS4", "B000HT386M", "B003Y5H574", "0800141741", "6305428115", "B00007E2F5", "B00005JMW7", "B00AEBB9WI", "B00008G8M4", "B002VECM6S", "B000LC3ICE", "B000ELJAEM", "B00003CXSM", "B004EPZ0BG", "B00AEBB8NS", "076780421X", "B00164KYV4", "B00AEFY0F2", "B003Y5H524", "B000VG66XS", "B00008WJD6", "B00AEFXWXI", "B002ZG998G", "B002ZG989G", "B000YDBPAM", "B000CEV3KU", "B00005JPE3", "B000AP04FG", "B00005JLQN", "B001C5LLQ4", "B00003CXO1", "B002P413IC", "B0001AVZA8", "B0012KJ0DK", "B0015I2RT8", "B000E6EHE0", "B001NPD9RM", "B00008VFCA", "B00006ZXSL", "B000FGGWGK", "B000098XQ8", "B001OQCUZM", "B000MQC9H4", "B00005JN3W", "B00005IBN0", "B003BV8ICC", "B00006FMUW", "B001SN78JO", "B000RBA6C4", "B0009UZGIM", "B001GKJ2E8", "B00005JNTU", "B000ZBEOEC", "B00AEFY4CG", "B0000B1OFL", "B008RNYMG0", "B0038N9WKU", "B0021L8UYY", "B000683VI4", "6304765266", "B000TZJBPQ", "B00005JLSB", "B0007PLLBU", "B000059TG6", "B002ZG9968", "B003EYVXXC", "B0000897EG", "B00005JM4Q", "B004IK30MI", "B00081U7HC", "B002ZG97B0", "B000P0J0EW", "B00005O5CM", "B005F2JRUC", "B000ASDFGI", "B00005JKCH", "B0006GAI5U", "B0000AKCKI", "B001UV4XRY", "B00005JMQW", "B0010X5X4O", "B000M341QE", "B001AKTZW8", "B00024JC4E", "B00AEBB8R4", "B00005JKMQ", "B00CLSBNNM", "B005LAII2Q"], "bought_together": ["B000N6U0E2", "B001QERPAC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000N6U0E2", "B002ZG97TW", "B002VECM6S", "B000AP04FG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 105544}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.94, "brand": "SMITH,WILL", "asin": "B000957O7S", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41jGu0AHCAL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Hitch (Fullscreen Edition)"}

{"description": "Fans ofIce Princesswill enjoy seeing the five deleted scenes, even though like most DVD deleted scenes they wouldn't have added much to the film.  In fact, the alternate opening (an extended scene that flashes back to Casey's earlier childhood) and a later scene would have undesirably softened Joan Cusack's and Kim Cattrall's characters.  Some cut scenes involving Casey and her Snoplow classmates are fun.  The two music videos spotlight key songs from the soundtrack, Caleigh Peters's \"Reach\" and Ally & AJ's \"No One,\" but co-star Hayden Panettiere's \"I Fly\" is a curious omission.  The commentary track follows the Disney trend of featuring its young actors, in this case Michelle Trachtenberg (Casey), Panettiere (Gen), Trevor Blumas (Teddy), and Kirsten Olsen (Nikki, the \"Jumping Shrimp\").  Film aficionados won't learn that much about the crafting of the movie, but the kids have spirit and talk about the \"exploding butt shot\" and who already knew how to skate.  It can be a little tricky to figure which girl is speaking, though.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002WY65V0", "B004CYVZ4K", "B000CCBCAI", "B0007US7C6", "B00005JMCW", "B00063KGPU", "B0024NSFYO", "B00795C5X4", "B000059XTL", "B000FCW15A", "B003B1X85O", "B00005JM9Q", "B00404ME2Y", "B0006SSMWE", "B000209KMW", "B003Y5H52O", "B001B7CO0K", "6305870179", "B000F48D5A", "B004SIP75S", "B00AEFYWQY", "B006X08DZ0", "B000AM4P9A", "B000H5V8CW", "B000324Y98", "B004QIG7CW", "B0001Z3HIG", "B001725ZD2", "B001R3YRIU", "B007I8KXDQ", "B0007LXPBI", "B000B2YR92", "B00005JPO4", "B00062IVN0", "B000ICM5SU", "B0009DWL8W", "B000VAPZM2", "B003PGNBNY", "B0007LXPBS", "B006JTS6XY", "B001KX50B0", "B001NE80P4", "B002WNU0QM", "B000FVQM4W", "B002WNU0OY", "044047731X", "B001G2S3Y6", "B000Y9PC7S", "B002GOAH1U", "B001GC9VK6", "B00GOITWRE", "B0007Z9R66", "B000F2BNW2", "B000JMK6OO", "B007DBGS4G", "B00005JN0Z", "B001FCD252", "B002BIULQ2", "B004IZVMXM", "B000CDSS0Y", "B0006GAOCW", "B00005JMXO", "6305428387", "B0009HLBQQ", "B0007Z9R5W", "B00004Y7D2", "B0013ND3MK", "B00005V9I9", "B004FXQYG2", "B00FKXBECU", "B001H1I8KK", "B000LXHFNG", "B001AR012O", "B001TUZD8O", "B000065V42", "B005EJIG62", "B004FJ87EI", "B000MBUXEA", "B00ANV82HE", "B000JFY05W", "B003NHRIVQ"], "bought_together": ["B000CCBCAI", "B004CYVZ4K"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001S3C0M4", "B000CCBCAI", "B00005JMCW", "B000FCW15A"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 22973}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.99, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B0009JE57G", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ESDWWN2SL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Ice Princess (Full Screen Edition)"}

{"description": "Isao Takahata's outr&#xE9; ecological fablePom Pokowas the no. 1 domestic film in Japan in 1994, and the first animated feature to be submitted for the Oscar for Foreign Language Film. In 1967, the raccoons in the Tama Hills find their homes are threatened with destruction when developers turn the rural area into suburbs. Under the leadership of their tribal elders the animals fight back with every resource at their disposal. Raccoons are shape-shifters in Japanese folk tales, and the members of this tribe can transform into objects, other creatures and even humans.Unlike Takahata's deeply movingThe Grave of the Fireflies,Pom Poko(the sound made by thumping the tummy of a comfortably full raccoon) is a broad comedy. The raccoons' efforts to understand humans, their evocations of traditional ghost stories to frighten construction crews, and their internecine quarrels offers plenty of laughs. But the story rambles, and the characters lack the depth needed to sustain the audience's interest until the film's belated, downbeat conclusion. The extras include Takahata's storyboards, which are interesting, but lack the magic of Hayao Miyazaki's drawings on other Studio Ghibli discs.

{"description": "Movie studios, by and large, avoid controversial subjects like race the way you might avoid a hive of angry bees. So it's remarkable thatCrasheven got made; that it's a rich, intelligent, and moving exploration of the interlocking lives of a dozen Los Angeles residents--black, white, latino, Asian, and Persian--is downright amazing. A politically nervous district attorney (Brendan Fraser) and his high-strung wife (Sandra Bullock, biting into a welcome change of pace fromMiss Congeniality) get car-jacked by an oddly sociological pair of young black men (Larenz Tate and Chris \"Ludacris\" Bridges); a rich black T.V. director (Terrence Howard) and his wife (Thandie Newton) get pulled over by a white racist cop (Matt Dillon) and his reluctant partner (Ryan Phillipe); a detective (Don Cheadle) and his Latina partner and lover (Jennifer Esposito) investigate a white cop who shot a black cop--these are only three of the interlocking stories that reach up and down class lines. Writer/director Paul Haggis (who wrote the screenplay forMillion Dollar Baby) spins every character in unpredictable directions, refusing to let anyone sink into a stereotype. The cast--ranging from the famous names above to lesser-known but just as capable actors like Michael Pena (Buffalo Soldiers) and Loretta Devine (Woman Thou Art Loosed)--meets the strong script head-on, delivering galvanizing performances in short vignettes, brief glimpses that build with gut-wrenching force.

{"description": "In 1952 Superman flew right into the hearts and minds of the American TV audience faster than a speeding bullet. Though most people were already familiar with man of steel through his comic books, as well as the popular radio show, it was the new medium'sAdventures of Supermanthat transformed our resident Kryptonian into a timeless icon. For many young baby boomers, Superman was the ultimate symbol of truth, justice and the American way. After watching this nostalgic trip back in time it is easy to see why: George Reeves. Reeves is the quintessential Superman. He is kind, confident, smart, always does the right thing and can literally do anything physically.  Even Reeves' Clark Kent is cool, even cocky without any of the trademarked shy, clumsy and hickish traits the character has developed over the years. And then there's Phyllis Coates as the Lois Lane. Coates portrayal of Lois is surprisingly one of the stronger female roles in '50s television.  She is one tough cookie able to stand her ground against criminals, fight off bad guys and is not afraid to outwardly express herself. Sadly, Phyllis Coates would be replaced by Noel Neill in subsequent seasons.Adventures of Supermanalso stands the test of time well as one of the best shows from the early days of television. A lot of it has to do with how the writers, producers and actors approached the making of the show.  This first season, as well as the second, were made as if they were making a serious show suitable for kids and adults. Instead of being a kids' comic book show, the episodes have a strong \"mini-serial-crime-movie\" feel, are very story driven and include loads of elements from the popular film noir style of the 1950s. This is evident in such classic episodes such as the season opener \"Superman on Earth,\" \"The Stolen Costume\" where Superman has his costume stolen by a burglar, and the tense horror-noir \"The Haunted Lighthouse.\" Also included on this DVD set is the 1951 theatrical releaseSuperman and The Mole Menwhich later became the televised two-part episode \"The Unknown People.\" --Rob Bracco", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000BT96FA", "B000EU1Q3Q", "B000HWZ4E8", "B000I8OM94", "B000AQOHNA", "B00LT1JHLW", "B001OD8E4G", "B000FO0AHY", "B004BBHVIS", "B000OPODNQ", "B00BBXSPCK", "6305943389", "B0007G89FU", "B00BBXSPES", "B001DJ7Q0E", "B00080ZG2O", "B000BT96EG", "B000EU1Q2M", "B00AKK6MD4", "B00G7QPX6C", "B004EXWGJW", "B00005LOUK", "B002K0WBDM", "B00DX88IL4", "B000KWZ7JC", "B00HFWETQW", "0445040548", "B00082ZROO", "B000P6XQ50", "B00HMOWA0A", "B001DJLD2G", "B00004Y2QO", "B00IF0KAYS", "B002KVSJ6O", "B002F3BPWW", "B00080ZG2E", "B0001ZMWYG", "B001992NXI", "B0006Z2KZ2", "B000EHQTZO", "B00C7QD8MC", "B0025Y3SZS", "B001JFKWE4", "B00801OMDM", "B000BGR1B4", "B0012EI8BQ", "B001D2WUCA", "B000ION23U", "B000BF0C8E", "B001CDFY5U", "B00BDZV4PQ", "B009M4KT3I", "B000BZISS0", "B00KH57U60", "B00DXLO0BI", "B0000648YD", "B00308B170", "B00KUS5YGC", "B0002F6BJW", "B000IJ79UW", "B000IJ79X4", "B000HWZ4BG", "B000IJ79VQ", "B0047XGYRO", "B004PQM81E", "B0002W4SPO", "B000N6UF10", "B00ESFUED6", "B000RO9PTQ", "B0002NRRRE", "B00E96AY20", "B00HMOW9YM", "B005TZFYWA", "B001SGN1JM", "B000051SH3", "B00005UWA8", "B000OPODNG", "B00DZP1C0O", "B000X07SQ6", "B00JPUUSEE", "B000F9SUP8", "B00DGNFMNS", "B00DGNFMJW", "B00D3DJH7S", "B000LXGXY8", "B00005JO3P", "B000K7VHYG", "B0057Q8QO4", "B00KDU8HQQ", "B00HETMEZE", "B00BPDBEO2", "B000EBGE9G", "B005ZKCG3E", "B000W8OM68", "B00062IYW8", "B00KHA88PC", "B0041KKBJK", "B000LV6W00", "B00005JM5Z", "B006WN5W5M"], "bought_together": ["B000BT96FA", "B000EU1Q3Q"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000HWZ4GQ", "B000EU1Q3Q", "B000HWZ4E8", "B000BT96FA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 19626}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 11.49, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B000A5046K", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61KExWvkZML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Adventures of Superman: Season 1"}

{"description": "Home to some of the world's best food and fashion, the French also have the wonderful habit of producing some of the world's best movies. WithHigh Tension, French director Alexandre Aja offers up a bloody buffet of terror; a violent concoction of style over substance, with a bloody French twist.       Two college girlfriends, Maria and Alex, take a weekend to study at the secluded country home of Alex's parents.   Shortly after their arrival, a mysterious killer appears, and things take a shockingly terrible turn for the worse. As the horror and body count rises, Maria and Alex find themselves fighting for their lives, and it's revealed that things are not exactly as they seem.     Essentially a one-act cat-and-mouse affair,High Tensionis an explosive bloody thrill ride that rarely lets up.   Oozing style in every color-saturated frame and boasting some intense performances, Aja mainly succeeds in sustaining an intense momentum throughout the film.  The plot occasionally suffers from a thin, flimsy storyline, and the abundant graphic scenes of violence will either thrill and delight, or simply disgust.   Nonetheless, this adrenalin-fueled addition to the genre gives the American slasher flick a real run for its money.High Tensionis high-art horror, and comes highly recommended.--Matt Wold", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001MEJY8W", "B0014VPFVS", "B00125WATQ", "B000EOTVU2", "B000GI3KGC", "B0009WFEDC", "B002EOVXBK", "B00GGY4R3K", "B001G9CNI6", "B00005K9O8", "B000WC38EQ", "B00009W0U4", "B000X1RYEQ", "B0041KKYCY", "B004AC6PV2", "B000EHRVP6", "B0028DRGDQ", "B000N3AW6G", "B005SQRYB4", "B001MFNB4O", "B000GSYRY6", "B000IHY9TS", "B000S0GYRU", "B00009MEC4", "B00187FPC2", "B001D2WU9I", "B0000CABGW", "B001B187L6", "B00G5GNYY2", "B008G1JIQC", "B001JV5BIA", "B002LMSWN2", "B000WC389G", "B0082A3HFK", "B002OVO18A", "B004P2VQZ2", "B00699G622", "B0009OUBC4", "B008JFUNYG", "B000FS9FE4", "B004EI2NP4", "B0013D8L7M", "B008NNY8XQ", "B000GI3RHY", "B00J81S92S", "B001D5C1OO", "B0031U8OEK", "B00196UTEG", "B006QWC2ZC", "B008WAM2E2", "B0015ET3YO", "B005J9ZFQG", "B000MM0LIM", "B00BSU0FQA", "B008BM5WQG", "B00AJLHUA8", "B000GLL1U6", "B003Q6D246", "B0083H6B0U", "B00006FDBW", "B001MVYUR0", "B000IMUYJM", "B00DMUFXOS", "B0021L8UPS", "B000099T3M", "B00CU00JTU", "B003L20IEC", "B0051CSIKQ", "B000NVT0TI", "B00DPUB5EW", "B001D5C1R6", "B00C7C00JU", "B000VKL6Z2", "B006U49SC6", "B0052DP1RC", "B00AZTUUQK", "B002DKGWSE", "B000FZEQWI", "B000RW5BZ0", "B0001611DI", "B0057O6IMS", "B00111YM5Q", "B00177YA6U", "B000UW8596", "B005ER6STG", "B0007WQHI0", "B00079HZY8", "B0009S2T0M", "B00005Q4CS", "B000PKG8TW", "B00006AUIG", "B000AXWHSA", "B001RTKKQW", "B003KGBISE", "B008G33PIM", "B004KDYR20", "6305228876", "B000PMLJMQ", "B002YICNE2", "B0060AAMEI"], "bought_together": ["B001MEJY8W", "B0014VPFVS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001MEJY8W", "B0014VPFVS", "B00GGY4R3K", "B000GI3KGC"]}, "price": 8.37, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 23934}, "asin": "B000ARFPMQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51K3uQHsEXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "High Tension (Unrated Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "\"It's a comedy, sort of,\" a title card announces at the start ofHappy Endings--just after Mamie (Lisa Kudrow) has been hit by a car. So it is, but talk about an unhappy beginning! Never fear, writer/director Don Roos will fulfill the promise of that title in several unexpected ways. The story then flashes back to 1983 for Mamie's life-altering encounter with her stepbrother. Mamie and Charley (Steve Coogan) will struggle with its consequences for the rest of the film. Does her teen pregnancy explain the fact that she became an abortion counselor or that he came out of the closet? Roos doesn't say, but nor does he judge. He loves his characters--foibles and all--in his ambitious, Altman-esque follow-up to the acerbic, yet heartfeltThe Opposite of Sex. As before, Kudrow is the center around which the other plotlines revolve (and her uptight, yet likable Mamie couldn't resemble TV&#x92;s Phoebe less). In the end, though, Maggie Gyllenhaal's seductive Jude and Tom Arnold's sensitive Frank are Roos' most inspired creations. Their relationship is one of contemporary cinema's oddest and most touching. The happy ending for one will be real, the other imaginary, but everyone will earn the one they get.--Kathleen C.

{"description": "Virtually unseeable for half a century,House by the River, the rarest of Fritz Lang's American films, proves to be an atmospheric serving of Southern Gothic with style and perversity to burn. This is a happy surprise, given that the film was made at a low point in Lang's career, at a Poverty Row studio, with a low-wattage cast. Louis Hayward--whose dark, spoiled good looks and insinuating smile suggest Orson Welles' tawdry evil twin--plays an effete author in a small 19th-century town. One hot, lazy afternoon he's tempted (in a brilliantly directed scene) by thoughts of the comely maid soaking in his upstairs bathroom. There follows an awkward pass, a hand over her mouth, and suddenly he finds himself an accidental murderer. With a dead body to get rid of, living by a river comes in handy. But on this river, secrets have a way of returning with the tide.The script by Mel Dinelli (who had just written the trim 1949 thrillerThe Window) ably milks the suspense, and there's a creepy moonlit search by rowboat for the now-you-see-it, now-you-don't corpse. The failed novelist, beginning to relish his guilt, acquires fresh inspiration as a writer and also becomes a cagy manipulator of other people, notably the wife (Jane Wyatt) who doesn't know what he's done, and the crippled brother (Lee Bowman) who does. Making a virtue of production resources only slightly upscale of Edgar G.

{"description": "Created by Steven Bochco and one of television's most influential series,Hill Street Blueswas not your father's cop show. The Emmy-winning pilot episode, \"Hill Street Station,\" immediately established the series as less a police procedural than an up-close and personal \"interface with the police experience.\" To establish gritty, documentary-like realism, the show featured sequences, such as the pre-credit roll call, that were filmed with a hand-held camera. There was chaotic, overlapping dialogue. There were sudden, shocking bursts of violence that claimed popular characters. Story lines were not wrapped up at the end of the hour, but instead, unfolded serially throughout the season. It's no wonder thatHill Street, while championed by most critics, was initially not embraced by viewers. It was, in the beginning, one of television's lowest rated shows, its case not helped by NBC's criminal practice of juggling it in its primetime schedule). But there is justice in Hollywood.Hill Street Blueswon the Emmy for best drama in its first season. Also honored were several members of the ensemble, including Daniel J. Travanti as the compassionate and incorruptible Precinct Capt. Frank Furillo, Michael Conrad as the avuncular Sgt. Phil Esterhaus (whose cautionary, \"Let's be careful out there,\" became the show's pop culture signature), and Barbara Babcock as the wildly sexual Grace Gardner, who rocks Esterhaus's world (particularly in the episode that earned her her statuette, \"Fecund Hand Rose\").There were no big stars onHill Street Blues(or, for that matter, no little stars, as one of the cast members jokes during a near-hour-long reunion featurette included as a bonus feature on this three double-sided disc set). Each was an indelible character, among them Charles Haid as cowboy cop Andy Renko, Veronica Hammel as sexy public defender Joyce Davenport, Bruce Weitz as the untamed, animalistic Belker, Keil Martin as LaRue, whose descent into alcoholism is one of the season's most compelling dramatic arcs, and James Sikking as the gung-ho Howard Hunter. Once daring,Hill Street Bluesseems almost quaint today, with none of the graphic sex or language that scandalizedNYPD Blue(in one episode, a captured cat burglar, portrayed by a pre-L.A. LawMichael Tucker, makes a reference to \"wolf pee-pee\"). The ethnic portrayals, too, are not exactly nuanced. But the human dramas at the heart ofHill Streetstill make for arresting television.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000EHSVC8", "B000GPPNO2", "B00188XHF8", "B00188XHFI", "B000BZISRG", "B00144K5LK", "B00008EY6N", "B000EXDS0C", "B00GHH9HUE", "B000K7VHJ6", "B000YGGNGK", "B000NDEXO8", "B00D2UMHVA", "B00FM4S8H6", "B00008PHCZ", "B005FQ2HBO", "B00HRUQA6O", "B00ITAQ2T6", "B001OXLGK0", "B00GSTHCHQ", "B00266PDZ8", "B00018D3RI", "B0002NY8R6", "B0009UC80Q", "B00308B170", "B00005JLFT", "B008K1PWMW", "B00005JO3P", "B00005JNHT", "B000BGR1B4", "B000YKYT1M", "B00KTFJ7UA", "B00080Z5FM", "B000LXGXY8", "B000N2HD6O", "B000TGURZ8", "B000Q6GUJS", "B00I4581F4", "B005PYL4VU", "B000NJMJHA", "B00005JNJ1", "B000BF0C8E", "B000E8JO2S", "B00008NV4G", "B000O77SOK", "B00HZMZ286", "B004STBFI0", "B002BWQ4C8", "B00GLT2TR6", "B002WQ79A4", "B001U9BS2O", "B0015XHR5C", "B0006N2EZK", "B0006Q93BU", "B001F7Q4JS", "B00006J6XH", "B004STBFPS", "B000MGBSH6", "B002PQ7JR4", "B00915G6Q2", "B000A0GOP0", "B00005JN8S", "B006WK4Y6I", "B00018YCJ6", "B000LE16VC", "B000MTEFUK", "B00005JMHI", "B006WK4Y8Q", "B000LV6VZQ", "B00KTFJ6J2", "B000XJD3K2", "B004STBEXQ", "B004STBF2G", "B000VS6R30", "B00HUCF420", "B00BTFK01Y", "B003UD7JC6", "B00005JLIC", "B002XKKX8E", "B001FSKE8E", "B000WMA74A", "B000291Q3O", "B0055SNHQG", "B001C0I61M", "B00319ECCY", "B001AQT158", "B00008972G", "B00005JLEY", "B00FM4S7P4", "B00383XZP8", "B000RZIGSQ", "B000H7JCG4", "B002LFQIL2", "B001E6JC1M", "B00HW3EXCE", "B00KHA9BQ2", "B009VXVMAO", "B004EI2NO0", "B000GB75CO", "B001675ZJM"], "bought_together": ["B000GPPNO2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00GSTHCHQ", "B000EHSVC8", "B000GPPNO2", "B00188XHF8"]}, "price": 17.98, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 32291}, "asin": "B000BOH8YG", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/519WWCXRMHL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Hill Street Blues - Season 1"}

{"description": "A hilarious comedy about frustrated waiters, stingy tippers and dicey food, Lions Gate Films' WAITING... stars Ryan Reynolds, Anna Faris and Justin Long as young employees battling boredom at Shenanigan's, a generic chain restaurant. A waiter for four years since high school, Dean (Justin Long) has never questioned his job at Shenanigan's. But when he learns that Chett, a high school classmate, now has a lucrative career in electrical engineering, he's thrown into turmoil about his dead-end life. Dean's friend Monty (Ryan Reynolds) is in exactly the same boat, but he couldn't care less. More concerned with partying and getting laid, Monty is put in charge of training Mitch (John Francis Daley), a shy new employee.  Over the course of one chaotic shift, Mitch gets to know the rest of Shenanigan's quirky staff: Monty's tough-talking ex-girlfriend, Serena (Anna Faris), Shenanigan's over-zealous manager, Dan (David Koechner), and head cook Raddimus (Luis Guzman), who's obsessed with a senseless staff-wide competition known only as \"The Game\"...  Featuring crazy busboys, unsanitary kitchen antics, and lots of talk about sex, WAITING... is a hysterical, behind-the-scenes look at the restaurant industry, and an affectionate ode to those lost, and thoroughly unproductive, days of youth.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001MFNB58", "B000EMGJAO", "B000069CF0", "B000LC3ICE", "B000E6EHE0", "B00363WGBO", "B000JJ4DNW", "B000IZJZIU", "B000WZEZGI", "B0023TCWE8", "B000I0RNVQ", "B00AEFYS2M", "B001J9KJ4I", "B000AP04L0", "B001L9EXTS", "B000Y7U93C", "B00AEFZ3XU", "B001OD4S50", "B00AEFXVW0", "B00007AJGM", "B00005JNZU", "B0002V7TMY", "B000031WD9", "B000YW8RN6", "B00260HH1W", "B0016MJ6GA", "B0009P42WI", "B000063RQO", "B00005JKMN", "B002ZG97XI", "B0017JHQPK", "B000BKVQS4", "B004HO6I2E", "B0007DFJ0G", "B004SIP6LS", "B001G5T6GW", "B000M9CB4W", "B00000FA91", "B00005JMX6", "B00005V9HR", "0783230338", "B004SIP8ES", "B00AEFXIUK", "B00029RTAI", "B0009HBPN0", "B001O0TWYK", "B000K7VHOG", "B001KKU9DW", "6301964160", "B00860YIJU", "B000EGDBZ6", "630529142X", "B000J4P9P8", "B000WCN8QE", "B004I9SJH0", "B00005JMYI", "B00AEFY854", "B00003CXPS", "B00AEFYZCU", "B002Q4VBPQ", "B007D0FUTG", "B003Y5H5B0", "B000O77SF4", "B002FU8IWU", "B003PIUINS", "B00003CXWV", "B002IKIHEG", "B004SIP95G", "B008R65XNS", "B002T4GWWA", "B00AEFYAMA", "B0068MNO2U", "B000MCH5RM", "B000BO0L90", "B002ZGW92E", "B005LAIH9A", "B000G0O5I2", "0790729997", "B004EPZ084", "B00009W5F2", "B000N3SU92", "B00AEFY0XE", "B00008WJD6", "B004SEUJO6", "6305222908", "B00DW5IKYS", "B00AEBB8FQ", "B0026BXHQ0", "B00AEBBA2C", "B000OYC7BW", "B002ZG98B4", "B000FKO5QK", "B00029RTCG", "B000TZJBPQ", "B000031EFY", "B0016Q2D66", "B00AG4714S", "B0006HBZEW", "0800141687", "B00441GYVK"], "bought_together": ["B001MFNB58", "B000EMGJAO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00E8RKHWW", "B000AP04L0", "B004SEUIW4", "B000EMGJAO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 11312}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.21, "brand": "Vidmark/Trimark", "asin": "B000CPH9PM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51TJVHXCPGL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Waiting...

{"description": "Rent, the show that in 1996 gave voice to a Broadway generation, has finally become an energetic, passionate, and touching movie musical. Based loosely on Puccini'sLa Boh&#xE8;me, it focuses on the year in the life of a group of friends in New York's East Village--\"bohemians\" who live carefree lives of art, music, sex, and drugs. Well, carefree until Mark, an aspiring filmmaker (Anthony Rapp), and Roger, an aspiring songwriter (Adam Pascal), find out they owe a year's rent to Benny (Taye Diggs), a former friend who had promised them free residence when he married the landlord's daughter. Roger has also attracted the attention of his downstairs neighbor, Mimi (Rosario Dawson), while Mark's former girlfriend, Maureen (Idina Menzel), has found a new romance in a lawyer named Joanne (Tracie Thoms). Philosophy professor Tom (Jesse L. Martin) finds his soul mate in drag queen Angel (Wilson Jermaine Heredia). But because this is the late-'80s, the threat of AIDS is always present.The remarkable thing aboutRentthe movie is that nearly 10 years after the show debuted onBroadway, six of the eight principals return in the roles they originated. They're a bit older than would be ideal for their characters, but they do have the advantage of having learned the show directly from creator Jonathan Larson (who died of an aortic aneurysm while the show was in previews), plus they started young--we're not exactly talking Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford here.  Alongside a polished performance like Rapp's--sometimes observer-commentator, sometimes participant in two of the score's showstoppers, \"The Tango Maureen\" and \"La Vie Boheme\"--the two new additions (Thoms in place of Fredi Walker, Dawson in place of the edgier Daphne Rubin-Vega) slip comfortably into the ensemble; the pivotal Dawson makes a seductive case as Mimi when she tempts Roger in the mesmerizing \"Light My Candle\" or burns up the stage of the Catscratch Club in \"Out Tonight.\"  Moviegoers who have an aversion to people who break into song while walking down the street probably won't have their minds changed byRent(even if they are singingrocksongs), and the gritty subject matter and lack of big-name stars make it unlikely to cross over to general audiences the wayChicagodid.  But fans of musicals should find \"Seasons of Love\" as stirring as ever, and the show's passionate admirers--the \"Rentheads\"--probably couldn't have wished for a more sympathetic director thanRentfan Chris Columbus, or a more faithful representation of the show they love.--David HoriuchiOn the DVDThree powerful musical numbers cut from the final film are the highlight of the two-disc DVD.  In the aftermath of the funeral scene, Anthony Rapp sings \"Halloween,\" and he, Adam Pascal, and Rosario Dawson share \"Goodbye Love\" (both songs were in the stage version). Then in an alternate ending, the cast finishes \"No Day But Today\" on the bare stage on which the film began.  There are worthwhile arguments for why these scenes were cut or replaced, so it's fortunate that the DVD lets us see these at all.  Those musical numbers have optional commentary by director Chris Columbus, Rapp, and Pascal (two other cut scenes have no commentary), including one funny moment in which Rapp explains in great detail the technical challenge of shooting \"Halloween\" only to have Columbus say, \"Yeah, but I don't know if that's the take we used.\"  The three also provide commentary on the film itself, with Columbus discussing various decisions, criticizing the critics, and marveling \"I still don't know how we got the PG-13,\" and Rapp and Pascal occasionally recalling differences in the stage version.The other whopper of a feature isNo Day But Today, a nearly two-hour documentary that uses video clips, still photographs, and interviews with family and friends to celebrate the short life of Jonathan Larson and his creation.  Topics include his early interest in musical theater (\"I want to write theHairfor the '90s.\"), the support of Stephen Sondheim, the impact of the AIDS epidemic, the long and difficult road ofRent(casting the show, Larson learning to collaborate, the transfer to a Broadway stage, and the Rentheads), and Larson's tragic death. The last 20 minutes covers the making of the film, director Chris Columbus, the decision to rely on most of the original cast (the only two principals who didn't appear in the movie, Daphne Rubin-Vega and Fredi Walker-Browne, are interviewed in earlier segments, but only mentioned in passing here), recording sessions, and location shooting.  If the movie ofRentwas a tribute to Jonathan Larson, the DVD is all that and more, a moving and incredibly detailed look at an extraordinary talent whom the world lost far too soon.--David HoriuchiMoreRentMovie soundtrackOriginal Broadway cast recordingAnthony Rapp'sWithout You: A Memoir of Love, Loss, and the Musical \"Rent\"", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001LMAKAG", "B000AYEI4U", "B006ZZQMXS", "B000005ALT", "B004SEUJBE", "B0007TKNII", "B000077VR3", "B002D0L0R2", "0688154379", "B00AEBBAEK", "B000Z8R2VW", "B002G1K82Q", "B00GM7ZFAA", "B00JAOW3MA", "B00006D295", "B005S9EK5Y", "B0028SVXVM", "B00004XMTJ", "B001MT7ZEW", "B001GKJ2DY", "B006Z21ZFG", "6304806418", "0743269772", "B0000AM6IY", "B0000TB01Y", "B00070HK24", "B002NZK5TG", "B002ZG976U", "B00AEFY5TI", "B000EWBKMG", "B00008973A", "1423406265", "B00AEFXTKO", "B0013Z7RUC", "B00004W5VC", "B00GTO6WXU", "B000I2J6YG", "B000RPCK2E", "0800141806", "0743269764", "B00028HBIO", "0783240287", "B0007WFXZI", "0792841638", "B005QIOKBQ", "1938438175", "B005SFR7YE", "B003L77GAQ", "B001FB55OE", "B000E3LHSM", "B00001PE59", "0767827929", "B000J3OTSM", "B000UAE7NG", "B005LAIHR2", "B009NYF2GQ", "B00005JOFQ", "B002ZG99IG", "B0000VCZKM", "B00005O3VD", "B001HN69AY", "B000FIHN5M", "B0011U52E2", "B0000524E5", "B003H6Z0PO", "B006WZIB1C", "B004D9FLJE", "0061350966", "B0053O8A5K", "B001CTA1UM", "B00G5G7EXY", "B00133KFGW", "B000URDCC6", "B001LMAKAQ", "B0009JE57G", "B009LDD5E0", "B00003CYJ4", "B00001PE4D", "B005PTMPYA", "B00005OCMS", "B004VJJFDE", "B00003CXHG", "B00447L4KA", "B0002E5O9G", "B0009IOR6Q", "B001FAFO3W", "B005BUA1HQ", "B00C81AVNU", "B00004RF9K", "B00166UFSY", "B002D0L0QS", "B00AMEZDJW", "B00006RIO7", "B00FGEO7OK", "B000683VI4", "B001JV5BF8", "B00005UQ9W", "B00GB0ORJ8"], "bought_together": ["B001LMAKAG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001LMAKAG", "B000077VR3", "B004SEUIWO", "B005SFR7YE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 7679}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.86, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B000E1YVZU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61ZTKXS4AGL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Rent (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition)"}

{"description": "InForty Shades of Blue, writer/director Ira Sachs takes three archetypes--temperamental artist, trophy wife, and brooding writer--and turns them into real people. Alan (Rip Torn,The Larry Sanders Show), producer of numerous R&B; hits, is a Memphis legend in the Sam Phillips mold. On a trip to Russia a few years ago, he met the much younger Laura (Dina Korzun,Last Resort), who became his common-law wife. They had a child. It should be a good life, except fidelity is not part of Alan's vocabulary. Michael (Darren Burrows,Northern Exposure), adult son from one of his many previous marriages, is an English teacher and aspiring author. When Michael travels from LA for a rare visit, he quickly realizes it's easier to talk to Laura than to his own father--or even his own wife, who decides to join him later. The more Alan, who perceives himself as a man of action, ignores Laura and belittles the introspective Michael, however, the closer they become. But how much of their attraction is based on lust and how much is based on a mutual desire to get back at the larger-than-life hitmaker for his misdeeds? Winner of the Grand Jury Prize at Sundance,Forty Shades of Bluemay sound like soap opera, but in the patient, attentive hands of Sachs (The Delta), it never plays like it. Alan, Michael, and Laura are neither heroes nor villains; just three lonely people trapped in self-contained worlds of their own creation.--Kathleen C.

{"description": "Helen Mirren's Elizabeth I could almost be cousin to her Jane Tennison. Like the dedicated detective chief inspector, Queen Bess is not without a heart, but work comes first and any romantic entanglements are doomed to fail. Fortunately, she has her friendships. Directed by Tom Hooper (Prime Suspect 6), this two-part HBO/Channel 4 tele-film begins in 1579. The Virgin Queen has been on the throne for 20 years, but has not married. Her closest relationship is with Robert Dudley, the Earl of Leicester (Jeremy Irons), whom the council will not allow her to wed. Because Robert wishes to produce an heir, he marries another, garnering Elizabeth's disfavor (and nor is he all that thrilled about her dalliance with Henry, the Duke of Anjou). In time, he'll return to her good graces. As she explains, \"Friendship outlasts love and is stronger than love.\" Then, as his health begins to fails, she'll turn to his stepson, the dashing, if duplicitous Robert Devereaux, the Earl of Essex (Hugh Dancy, the Hooper-directedDaniel Deronda). Meanwhile, Mary, Queen of Scots (Barbara Flynn) plots against her Protestant cousin. Even after Mary makes her exit, plenty of other powerful Catholics will stop at nothing to seize the crown. Marked as much by triumph as tragedy, the role of Elizabeth I has been catnip for many illustrious actresses, notably Bette Davis, Glenda Jackson, and Cate Blanchett. Mirren's multi-faceted portrayal of the queen's golden years is a worthy addition to that canon and Irons is a particularly formidable foil.--Kathleen C.

{"description": "Henrietta, Claes, Triela, Angelica, and Rico, the adolescent heroines of the broadcast seriesGunslinger Girl(2003), are orphans who have been turned into petite assassins through cybernetic implants and brainwashing. Each girl has an older, male \"handler\" from the Social Welfare Agency, a covert branch of the Italian government, who oversees her training and takes her on missions. The miniature murderers travel through Italy, dispatching criminals, right-wing terrorists, and uncooperative police officers with a cold-blooded efficiency Scarface might envy. The girls remember a few scattered fragments of their past lives, and the only feeling they express is a mixture of affection and adoration for the handlers. This lack of emotion makes them singularly unappealing as characters and robsGunslinger Girlof the pathos ofSaikano. None of them feels a shred of regret for their murderous actions: In episode 8, Henrietta complains that's she's only killed four people in the last month.

{"description": "Even with one episode missing,The Tick vs. Season Oneoffers a dozen good reasons to enjoy one of the wackiest superheroes of all time. From his humble beginnings as an in-house comic book character created by 17-year-old Ben Edlund for a Boston comic shop, the Tick (with his muscular physique, twitching antennae, and form-fitting \"blue tights of justice\") has proven remarkably popular and versatile as a multimedia juggernaut, attracting a global fan base in comics, then this animated series beginning in 1994, and finally as alive-action comedy seriesstarring Patrick Warburton as \"the big blue bug of justice.\" All three of the Tick's incarnations are wildly entertaining, but the animated series comes closest to capturing the unbridled giddiness of Edlund's comics, albeit somewhat sanitized for a Saturday-morning audience of kids and Tick-loving teens and grown-ups. And while episode #11, \"The Tick vs. The Mole Men\" (widely considered to be one of the first season's weakest episodes) is missing here for legal reasons (but may be included in a future DVD release), the 12 episodes included are remarkably consistent in their well-written hilarity of character and plotting. \"The Tick vs. Chairface Chippendale\" is just one example of the series' rogue's gallery of oddball monstrosities (the villain's head is a wooden chair, after all!) and the show's clever writers are always finding inventive ways to incorporate in-jokes, show-biz homage (such as the villainous \"Uncommon Cold,\" who sounds suspiciously like James Mason!), and choice bits of throwaway dialogue that will cause older viewers to burst out laughing.It's regrettable that Buena Vista (i.e., Disney) didn't include any bonus features with this two-disc set (at the very least, the Tick's comic book origins should be acknowledged), and the color and clarity of these episodes varies a bit, from crisp and clean to just a little it fuzzy. But let's face it, the animation (as good as it is) isn't exactly state-of-the-art, and most ofThe Tick's quality is derived from the outrageous cast of characters (including patriotic superheroine American Maid and the Tick's moth-costumed sidekick, Arthur), all of whom reside in a kind of alternate world of hyper-imagination. Perhaps that's whyThe Tickhas proven so enduring as a pop-cultural touchstone of the late 20th century: Whether he's in a comic book, an animated cartoon, or a live-action sitcom, the Tick is just a goofy, lovable, well-meaning reflection of our better selves, eager (as the saying goes) to swat evil on the snout with the rolled-up newspaper of goodness.

{"description": "The hook-wielding Fisherman returns in the third installment of the popular teen-horror franchise based on Lois Duncan's novelI Know What You Did Last Summer. Jennifer Love Hewitt, who top-billed the previous entries, is nowhere to be found in this film, and the action has been moved from a fishing village to a Colorado ski community where a gaggle of attractive teens led by Amber (Brooke Nevin) are wrapped up in a prank gone wrong which again results in an unfortunate death. The friends commit to keeping the accident silent, until they are plagued by mysterious messages that implicate them in the murder. What follows is the standard stalk-and-slash, with the Fisherman (played here by Don Shanks) dispatching the guilty parties with a modicum of bloody special effects, until the inevitable showdown. Director Sylvian White, an acclaimed music-video helmer, pulls out all the visual stops to deliver a \"cutting edge\" thriller, but the story itself was drained of any interest by the two previous films, and what's left is a empty exercise in flashy excess that may prove a passing entertainment for teen viewers seeking a good excuse to scream (and snuggle). The DVD includes a making-of featurette and an anemic, tech-minded commentary track by White.--Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305300801", "6305017115", "B000A5045Q", "B005CFBYW6", "B004LWZW2O", "0767824954", "B0009MWEM6", "B0009MWELW", "B003PIUINS", "B004EPZ08O", "B0000541TL", "B004SIP9MY", "B00JF5GAIW", "B004SIP9P6", "B005OK722U", "B000099T3M", "B004SIP9O2", "B00CAATSME", "B000UJ48P4", "0767802497", "B000PMLJMQ", "B004AC6PV2", "B00006LPHA", "B000F6IOAM", "B004P7CN7W", "B000FA57US", "B00275EHDM", "B00005JMDZ", "B00275EHFU", "B00AEFY37C", "B005CFC0N8", "B000EHRVP6", "B000WC389G", "B004P7CM9Q", "B00003CXUP", "B003ZZ7TPG", "B000KJU1KK", "B00DTPRZ24", "B00BM4Q4H6", "B00006FDBT", "B000RIWAVW", "B004AC6PMG", "B002YICNE2", "B00DTPRZ10", "B000FA57UI", "B000VKL6Z2", "B000AM4P9K", "B00JMLQGQ0", "B004SUDQ1I", "B000CCBC9O", "B0002JP572", "B003PIUINI", "B000RGN2JI", "B0000VCZMK", "B002I41KNC", "B0000AOX09", "B004P7CNUY", "B0000APVJ0", "B00004XPPI", "B00018D42W", "B00CERJI5U", "B0000CEB6Y", "B001YYQ9S8", "B001GCUO4S", "B000056T5E", "B005GT3X68", "B001P3SA9Y", "B001NPD9LS", "0792840127", "B00009WVSL", "B0020PFYHC", "B004LWZW2Y", "B0001LJCKC", "B001KEHAEO", "B00AIZ2FPK", "B002XD0J80", "B00DTPRYY8", "B000MM0LIM", "B00006FI0R", "B00AZMFINM", "B004TI35YC", "B000EHSVLE", "B00AEFYGBA", "B00000F0AD", "B00005JLKN", "B003Q6D27S", "B000055WFZ", "B000FOQ1KY", "B00AQJ8MLY", "B008MXMFVE", "B002AS45VK", "B000FC2HS6", "B00IVLRA9E", "B000FS9FE4", "B004SIP9I8", "B0057YUV6C", "B00003CWRF", "B001L9EXUC", "B00B96TGQS"], "bought_together": ["6305300801", "6305017115"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000A5045Q", "6305300801", "B005CFBYW6", "6305017115"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 150206}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.54, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B000FSME9M", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514QuGIu1EL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "I'll Always Know What You Did Last Summer"}

{"description": "This Jack Black vehicle seems, on the surface, like a perfect fit for the actor: an opportunity to showcase Black's unique style with the extreme facial gestures and exuberant physicality that have become his forte. Black plays Ignacio, a lowly cook in a monastery in central Mexico who feeds orphans by day, and wrestles in the town square at night. Ignacio teams up with Esqueleto (Hector Jimenez), a street urchin who tormented him, to form a tag-team duo that goes up against the strangest wrestlers Mexico has to offer. Besides doing it for money to feed the orphans, Ignacio is also fighting to win the forbidden affections of Sister Encarnacion (Ana de la Reguera) with predictable difficulty. While the movie has likeable characters and the plot is enjoyable enough, it can&#x92;t overcome its plodding pace and formulaic structure enough to keep the movie interesting throughout. Jack Black is a very strong comedic actor, and the wrestling scenes offer plenty of chances for slapstick, physical comedy, but watching him run around in red briefs and blue tights amounts to half the laughs in the movie, and there&#x92;s just not enough here for him to really work with. When he plays a more well-formed character, as inSchool of RockandHigh Fidelity, his strengths really show. But inNacho Librehe&#x92;s saddled with a caricature. Weighed down by too much low-brow humor and a script that goes nowhere,Nacho Librejust can&#x92;t make full enough use of Black&#x92;s talents to overcome the obstacles.--Daniel Vancini", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00H47IXTC", "B003498RCW", "B00AEFYP3E", "B00AEBB87O", "B00AEFY7YQ", "B001IKKMCW", "B001GPOSYC", "B00AEFYYA8", "B00BG4R476", "B00AEBB9C8", "B004IK30S2", "B000WQWPJQ", "B004SJ0EBE", "B005ERX1UU", "B0018O4YSQ", "B005DZ35TU", "B00AEFXXFU", "B00CXYCBNA", "B00AEFYRVO", "B002KLAL8S", "B00193F304", "B00E9E4F68", "B0062VL4XS", "B00AEFXIQE", "B00E3QJ7FG", "B00CXY9WIM", "B00H7KJTCG", "B004ZJZQ1A", "B00DYEN6XC", "B00HWWUQYY", "B007Q1GJA6", "B000MEYFXW", "B00AEBBAEA", "B00AEFXJNQ", "B001G5T6GC", "B00JL6L4WC", "B00H83EV5W", "B00COHGPQA", "B008V5UQZK", "B003IWZ750", "B008JFUR10", "B008MIMWOO", "B00AEBBAF4", "B004TJ1H0A", "B004047XWU", "B006WZIETG", "B005KQVDH8", "B002ZG97WO", "B0014DFCMS", "B00267QOEQ", "B0021L9ME6", "B001O7JHW0", "B001IKKMD6", "B00AEFXDGE", "B0090SI582", "B004RQDPBE", "B0014BQQZM", "B001KZVQJI", "B0082JRF7C", "B001KEHAHQ", "B000J4P9PI", "B0029XFN8A", "B00CTSDDVO", "B001CW7ZUS", "B00COHGORU", "B00HERGM86", "B0093LE2OC", "B0047685I2", "B00BLN4UDI", "B004RQDYXI", "B00DHHWY9I"], "bought_together": ["B00H47IXTC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001JNNDE2", "B0082JRF7C", "B0054OGQOQ", "B005ERX1UU"]}, "price": 19.95, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 149245}, "asin": "B000HDZK1Y", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51sDOKT8e4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Nacho Libre [Blu-ray]"}
{"description": "Cunningly fusing father-son sentiment and more blows to the groin per minute than any other movie you'll see this (and possibly any other) year,Little Manaims to win the heart of any man who's ever wished his son was actually a foul-mouthed, jewel-thieving midget. The rubbery face of Marlon Wayans (White Chicks) is digitally transposed onto the body of an actual midget so that Marlon can play Calvin, a bad-tempered thief who's trying to retrieve a humongous diamond from the purse of Vanessa (Kerry Washington,Ray), the buppie wife of Darryl (Shawn Wayans,Scary Movie 2). Darryl doesn't care about his wife's new promotion, he just wants to have a child--and he gets one when Calvin arrives on his doorstep dressed in baby clothes. At which point, the kicks, head-butts, and blunt object trauma to the groin begin. It's beside the point to argue whether or not this is definitively funny; blows to the groin either make you laugh or they don't, and if they do, you know who you are and you should seek this movie out. It will give you all you could possibly ask for, including numerous jokes about bodily functions and breasts. Also featuring John Witherspoon (Friday), Tracy Morgan (Saturday Night Live), Chazz Palminteri (Bullets Over Broadway), and cameos by Molly Shannon (Superstar) and Rob Schneider (Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo). --Bret FetzerStills fromLittle Man(click for larger image)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEFYQWO", "B0002VYOVI", "B0002B14UW", "B0014QLEI6", "B004FPE43K", "B000RBA6C4", "B00177YFYM", "B000803BQC", "B0034G4P1C", "B00008K7AM", "B00BLN4V46", "B004P7CMZ0", "B0007N1A36", "B004WJT5E2", "B00124ONGA", "6305505780", "B000ZBEOEC", "B00003CY51", "B00005JM4W", "B000YAF4Q6", "6304821832", "B000R5OFNG", "B00JPFTW1E", "B002GSXKOM", "B000FOQ1KY", "B00AEFXY6I", "B004SIP8YI", "B00AZMFINM", "B00003CXPS", "B00006LPH6", "B002AT4JOM", "B001DJLD12", "B000BFH2C8", "B002GSXKO2", "B00007BK2S", "B000BTITFI", "B001JV5AZE", "B00005JND5", "B000FS9ULC", "B004BZ5AJG", "B004SIP9E2", "B00008WI9O", "B00CAATSME", "B001QUF7DS", "B002CAWNEM", "B00005B8UA", "B000095J01", "B0009RCPUW", "B00005JN4H", "B000VXWX7E", "B00000JGHV", "0767813901", "B00HX0KIAM", "1558908390", "B00005IBN0", "B000069DOB", "B00AG472HY", "B003Y5H56K", "B0000AGQ6T", "B003Y5H58S", "B000MTFFO0", "B001690X6A", "B0014BQR7Y", "B0009DWL8W", "B001KKU9DM", "B00005JLQT", "B00HW3EI3I", "B00003CXNG", "B000BUE5E6", "B000HT386M", "B0006QAIG4", "B0050OWMKW", "B000PE0GRI", "B0001MMGC2", "B001GKJ2E8", "6305428409", "0783237367", "B00000K3UU", "B00003CY1Y", "B00BTYPWDQ", "B0000TWMTS", "B0002J4YVK", "B00008977B", "B0006GAI5U", "0780627822", "B000228EHM", "B00006JDVT", "B0001FR3HW", "B0021L8UYY", "B0000ZMH1A", "B008PENF1O", "B004SIP9I8", "B000060MWA", "B00066FAQW", "B008Y1YJN6", "B002CA68NO", "B000063RQO", "B00005UQ9A", "B00E1HIXA2"], "bought_together": ["B00AEFYQWO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AEFYQWO", "B0009RCPUW", "B0002VYOVI", "B0007N1A36"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 38060}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.19, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B000IFRT4W", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51QiGsadF6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Little Man (Widescreen)"}

{"description": "This staggeringly gorgeous interpretation of Hans Christian Andersen's classic fairy taleThe Snow Queenbegan as a concert of the pretty music by Paul K. Joyce. The story is told in broad strokes: A mother (Juliet Stevenson,Truly Madly Deeply) and her daughter Gerda (teen soprano Sydney White, who's been tearing up the musical stages in England) take in a homeless boy named Kay. When Kay disappears, kidnapped by the vampiric Snow Queen (ancestress to the White Witch of Narnia, no doubt), Gerda sets off in pursuit and comes across helpful ravens, talking flowers, moving statues, and benevolent reindeer in the course of her hero-journey. The wholly digital world created for this film is astonishing; much of it looks like hand-painted Victorian photographs, each image suitable for framing. Ironically, as the story grows more magical, the imagery turns more conventionally \"fantastic\" (the Snow Queen's arctic lair is a bit like Superman's Fortress of Solitude). But the overall texture of the movie is engagingly stylized, with movement that seems staggered yet graceful, like a silent film.The Snow Queendemonstrates that digital technology can make a more ethereal aesthetic as vivid and startling as a slimy alien or a bigger explosion.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00EQ2KVQQ", "B00007G1VR", "B00EBBGLH0", "B00394DW2W", "B003RHZ6IE", "B00B04NIZO", "B000PHVY76", "B0000640T0", "B00016XOBU", "B00EC6VT8U", "B006VJ1AAI", "B002436WFI", "B006MHZ294", "B001AZIRV8", "B00HZMZ2HM", "B00005Y6ZJ", "B000EXDS4S", "0062209507", "B000AQOHMG", "B00007G1ZX", "B00I099JZK", "B0000AUHQR", "B0010X744G", "B003C5FMNK", "B004B93RDS", "B008L0YN22", "B006JN87WK", "B0010X741Y", "B0000694XX", "B00FA2CBEG", "B004FZWDPG", "B00A7E8PA6", "B002XJDUV2", "B00198LHB8", "B00015HXDG", "B000796ND2", "B00HW3LAF2", "B002SAMMEC", "B003E66Y84", "B005LAII0I", "B0000AYK1R", "B007JVSRKS", "B00B1LM77G", "B002CAWNF6", "B0007OCG5Q", "B008JFUNTG", "B000FQIRXQ", "B00DOZRT0W", "B004P7CN3G", "B00077BPA0", "B003EYVXXW", "B001B73Q20", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B0012IWO0I", "B008JFURII", "B009RX85N0", "B000A8AXXG", "B00DPUB56U", "B00AOCDDGC", "B0009JE57G", "B00005JPO4", "B00AEFY6DI", "B007701RFS", "B000FVQM4W", "B004LWZW8I", "B008Y1YK9Y"], "bought_together": ["B0006HU2X2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00EQ2KVQQ", "B00394DW2W", "B001AZIRV8", "B00007G1VR"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 49862}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 6.0, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B000JLTS7Q", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Gz9x-S5lL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Snow Queen"}

{"description": "Here's one of Hollywood's great excursions into surrealism:The Gang's All Here, the legendarily over-the-top wartime musical. Director Busby Berkeley threw every demented idea that every swirled out of his teeming brain into this madcap affair, and decades later the film was still wowing 'em as a campy jaw-dropper.The plot is the nonsensical stuff of homefront musicals, with chorus girl Alice Faye waiting for soldier boy James Ellison to return from the war, little knowing he is engaged to another woman. But the real point here is the crazy production design and the flabbergasting numbers--most famously, Carmen Miranda's \"The Lady in the Tutti-Frutti Hat,\" which includes a chorus line of women dancing while holding giant bananas over their heads. It might have been dreamed up by Salvador Dali after an acid trip. Alice gets her due with the equally crazy \"Polka-Dot Polka,\" and Benny Goodman and his orchestra are also around. So are such reliable second bananas (you should excuse the expression) as Edward Everett Horton and high-kicking Charlotte Greenwood.The DVD extras include a 20-minute documentary on Berkeley's peculiar art, plus a charming 25-promotional film featuring Alice Faye reminiscing about her old pictures and extolling the virtues of physical fitness (made for the Pfizer drug company while Faye was their spokesperson).

{"description": "First screened in Europe and scheduled for limited release in the U.S.,The Illusionistoffers welcome proof that \"arthouse\" quality needn't be limited to the arthouses. Set in turn-of-the-century Vienna, this stately, elegant period film benefited from a crossover release in mainstream cinemas, and showed considerable box-office staying power--granted, teenage mallrats and lusty males may have been drawn to the allure ofSeventh Heavenalumna Jessica Biel, who rises to the occasion with a fine performance. But there's equal appeal in the casting of Edward Norton and Paul Giamatti, who bring their formidable talents to bear on the intriguing tale of a celebrated magician named Eisenheim (Norton) whose stage performance offends the Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell), a vindictive lout who aims to marry Duchess Sophie (Biel), Eisenheim's childhood friend and now, 15 years later, his would-be lover. This romantic rivalry and Eisenheim's increasingly enigmatic craft of illusion are investigated by Chief Inspector Uhl (Giamatti), who's under Leopold's command and is therefore not to be trusted as Eisenheim and Sophie draw closer to their inevitable reunion. Cleverly adapted by director Neil Burger from Steven Millhauser's short story \"Eisenheim the Illusionist,\" and boasting exquisite production values and a fine score by Philip Glass,The Illusionistis the kind of class act that fully deserved its unusually wide and appreciative audience. --Jeff ShannonBeyondThe Illusionist\"Eisenheim the Illusionist\" and Other StoriesPaul Giamatti in a More Loveable RoleMagic Kits & AccessoriesStills fromThe Illusionist", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000LC55F2", "B000NOIX48", "B002ZG980U", "B002WNU0QW", "B00DWZHTOU", "B001MZ5W3M", "B00011CZRE", "B000H0MKI8", "B00008K7AO", "B000L212HC", "B00AEBB8NI", "B000GFLKF8", "B000O76ZO4", "B00003CXZ4", "B00005JLSB", "B000FKO5QK", "B000M341QE", "B00AEFXGIY", "B00005V9HH", "B00AEBB8LA", "B00005JMOW", "B00096S49Y", "0767847415", "6305313687", "B004SIP9Z6", "B0047T74CM", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B000R4SMCW", "B0002YLCG0", "B000P0J0EW", "B000HEWEE4", "B0041KKYHE", "B00BBI7EZY", "B00AEBBA2W", "B000CQLZ0Q", "0783235070", "0767802519", "B002ZG997C", "B00003CXHG", "B004SIP7ZS", "B000069HZP", "B004SIP7PS", "B003ASLJQI", "B00177Y9ZC", "B00005JLKN", "B003ZW9H68", "B001N44BVQ", "B002O3Z50Q", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00005JN2Z", "B00AEBB86A", "B00000F4ZY", "B000MZHW40", "0671686402", "B00BB67UNW", "B005HP2J0M", "B000QXDED6", "B000NIVJF4", "B001F12J0C", "B000N6TX1I", "B000LAZE8C", "B00080ZG10", "B005LAIGRS", "B0009MDPYM", "0792159659", "B000OYC7BW", "B001UV4XGU", "B004AOECXI", "0767818105", "B000XR9L50", "B0018O4YT0", "B00015YVDG", "B004SIP8JI", "B00004XPPG", "B00006ZXSK", "B001DHXT20", "B0000AC8LR", "B009B8YMB0", "0783229402", "B0006210ZG", "B001PPGAIA", "B00004BZIY", "B008JFURII", "B00005JPAR", "B00006ADFM", "B004SIP7TE", "B000F5GNX8", "B000FS9FCG", "B006P0FIGU", "B00005JMCN", "B002VWNID6", "B004XQO90O", "B004EPZ084", "B00AEBB9M8", "B000P5FH3K", "B00005JNY3", "B000063US3", "B003L20IG0"], "bought_together": ["B000LC55F2", "B002ZG980U"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000LC55F2", "B005LAIHXQ", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00DV2MVWO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 60145}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.0, "brand": "Twentieth Century Fox", "asin": "B000K7VHPU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51nYghoS63L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Illusionist (Full Screen Edition)"}

{"description": "The feverish spectacle of a summer camp for evangelical Christian kids is the focus ofJesus Camp, a fascinating if sometimes alarming documentary. (Shortly after its release, the movie gained a new notoriety when Ted Haggard, president of the National Association of Evangelicals, who appears near the end of the film, resigned his post amid a male prostitute's allegations of drug use and sexual misconduct.) For most of the film, we follow a charismatic teacher, Becky Fischer, as she trains young soldiers in \"God's Army\" at a camp in North Dakota. Some of the kids emerge as likable and bright, and eager to continue their work as pint-sized preachers; elsewhere, the visions of children speaking in tongues and falling to the floor in ecstasy are more troubling. Even more arresting is the vision of a generation of children home-schooled to believe that the Bible is science, or Fischer's certainty that America's flawed system of democracy will someday be replaced by a theocracy. (In one scene, a cardboard cut-out of George W. Bush is presented to the children, who react by laying their hands on the figure as though in a religious procession.) Filmmakers Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady maintain neutrality about all this, maybe too much so (they throw in some interviews with radio host Mike Papantonio to provide a liberal-Christian viewpoint) and one would like to know more about the grown-ups presented here. Power broker Haggard is the creepiest person in the film, an insincere smooth talker whose advice to one of the young would-be campgoers comes across as entirely cynical. Time will tell whether the film's Christian soldiers will be marching onward.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000NIVJH2", "B001MFNB5I", "B000CAPZBC", "B000CCW2VG", "B001J21JRQ", "B00KY6YAO2", "B00008DDVV", "B001GCUO02", "B002I9Z8EO", "B0001NBNDY", "B001BEK8FQ", "B0010YSD7M", "B0000ACOXL", "B000092T6A", "B0000WN13Q", "B000UNYK4E", "B001M564BQ", "B000F48D78", "B000KX0IOA", "B003YJENZM", "0615509584", "B000C3L2IO", "B000T5MP72", "B002Z9JJXS", "B000ICL3KG", "B003ASLJQI", "B00005JN0T", "B001FACH7S", "B00DT55ORM", "B000AYEIY0", "B00AOCDEDY", "0988245108", "B0007WFYBG", "B001DWNUD8", "1939578191", "149217744X", "B008PZ69SE", "B000UNYJXQ", "B00470MG06", "B006TTC5MM", "B001E5FYS8", "B00009YXAS", "B000YHQNCI", "B000E5LEVU", "0767805712", "B000BMY2NS", "B003Q6D28C", "B00094AS72", "B0000SXK0Y", "1456588850", "B002HSD0J6", "B00007GVM0", "B00028HBIO", "B00A4TMLKE", "B002SAMMME", "B00005KHJY", "6305257442", "B00EL6AAEU", "B004CJQVQC", "B001DPHDA6", "B004EPYZPS", "1616141689", "B00F98FORM", "B00G3DA63Y", "B009MBSWUS", "B005LAIIHG", "B0047UJBP4", "0615927904", "B00BX49B6G", "B00005JKCH", "B00008RH3J", "B0030Y11XS", "B000BTH4K4", "B00006673L", "0767837991", "B000MTFFUO", "0783225733", "B000FBH3W2", "B00G0PXU2Y", "B0041KKYBA", "B000060MW1", "B00003CWN3", "B000XQ4HR8", "0393061027", "B000U6YJLU", "0231139624", "1478716568", "B001GMZGMI", "B00008DDJ6", "0143116649", "B000YY6VIC", "B001HZ30O0", "023033895X", "0671203231", "B00FGVRZT2", "B00094AS6I", "B0000DIJOO", "0195141830", "B001EDFSIQ", "B000A2XCBC"], "bought_together": ["B001MFNB5I"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001MFNB5I", "B000CCW2VG", "B000NIVJH2", "B001J21JRQ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 106626}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.83, "brand": "MAGNOLIA HOME ENTERTAINMENT", "asin": "B000KLQUV2", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510JRNQD6DL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Jesus Camp"}
{"description": "World War I aviation action gets an impressive digital upgrade inFlyboys, a welcome addition to the \"dogfight\" sub-genre that includes such previous war-in-the-air films likeHell's Angels,Wings, andThe Blue Max. While those earlier films had the advantage of real and genuinely dangerous flight scenes (resulting, in some cases, in fatal accidents during production),Flyboystakes full (and safe) advantage of the digital revolution, with intensely photo-realistic recreations of WWI aircraft, authentic period structures, and CGI environments requiring a total of 850 digital effects shots, resulting in an abundance of amazing images, many of them virtually indistinguishable from reality. Unfortunately, the film's technical achievement is more impressive than its screenplay, which conventionally and predictably tells the fact-based story, set in France in 1916, of the daring young pilots of the Lafayette Escadrille, a pioneering French air-combat unit that welcomed American enlistees prior to the United States' entry into the war.There's a familiar clich&#xE9; to match every thrilling scene of aerial combat, but director Tony Bill manages to keep it all interesting, from the romance between a young American maverick (James Franco) and a pretty French girl (newcomer Jennifer Decker) to the exciting action in the air, which includes a stock variety of heroes (many of them composites of real-life WWI pilots) and an intimidating villain known only as \"The Black Falcon,\" whose Fokker Dr-1 triplane (one of many in the film) recalls the exploits of German \"ace of aces\" Manfred von Richtofen, the dreaded \"Red Baron\" of legend. With impeccable production values that will impress even the most nit-picking aviation buffs,Flyboys(likeSuperman ReturnsandApocalypto, also released in 2006) was also one of the first feature films to be shot with Panavision's state-of-the-art Genesis digital cameras, resulting in beautiful images that meet or exceed the visual nuance of film.Flyboysalso benefits from painstaking attention to physical detail, making it easier to forgive its shortcomings as a generic and formulaic slice of romanticized history. So while some viewers may have wished for a more realistic and grown-up depiction of the Lafayette Escadrille, it's safe to say thatFlyboyswill be thrilling its target audience for many years to come.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0039USJBK", "B005411P6I", "B005LAIGNC", "B000WC39RW", "B000J6I0TS", "B000JSI7C6", "B00HS66C5Q", "B004SIP81Q", "B00AEFXV8O", "B00008AOTN", "B000JVSUS4", "B00IKPXX92", "B00BWJQEFS", "B004ZJZQFG", "B004TJ1H0A", "B00L4K3MLE", "B00AEBB9O6", "B00JG88XD8", "B007LNBRKQ", "B000VDDWDS", "B004UMAPUO", "B00DL48CN4", "B000OCZD5Q", "B000K0YLMS", "B000WC39SG", "B00IVLR9LI", "B000O77QD8", "B009A87ZKG", "B000O77RLE", "B00HLTD49C", "B000KN9F5I", "B001U6YI8S", "B00AEBBA0Y", "B00J11U4T6", "B000G0O5N2", "B000K0YLMI", "B00K2CHWYI", "B00000F2UF", "B00JL6L4WC", "B003LL3N1I", "B00AEFXRMO", "B00HEPEBWC", "B002GHHHPQ", "B000PAAJVA", "B005OOSQ7Q", "B00AEBB9T6", "B001XURJCS", "B000VZGK3K", "B00AIBZMM2", "B00H83EV5W", "B00BWH6DBA", "B000YKYT6M", "B000GRU0A2", "B000Y5CHIE", "B00AEFYCQO", "B00JA3RPAG", "B000O176IO", "B001LRJH0K", "B00BN3DUVE", "B00J11U5CW", "B002ZG97RY", "B00121QGUO", "B000E1ZKJQ", "B000JSI7AS", "B000F9RB94", "B0076YFJUY", "B00HWWUQYY", "B00IYJFB2G", "B001PPGAIK", "B00HW3L2R8", "B00HF98SNK", "B00HEEAM94", "B00IQAUO4S", "B000M2E30O", "B008JFUNNM", "B00GICP84W", "B005FUTC1I", "B000KX0ISQ", "B0049GYXH2", "B0002MHE1O", "B000ICLRHU", "B00KPP6ZLS", "B000ICLRJ8", "B00AEBB8BA", "B000ICLRIE", "B008JFUO4U", "B00AEBBA1S", "B00A29HFMU", "B005NFJAT4", "B0064NTZ6W", "B00E2083J4", "B00275EGX8", "B00487HQUI", "B00AEFXYCC", "B00406UK5A", "B000JUB7LW", "B0039USJBA", "B006WXHJGC", "B0049GYXEA", "B00GMV8JEA"], "bought_together": ["B0039USJBK", "B000WC39RW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005LAIGNC", "B000ESSSGG", "B00HS66C5Q", "B0039USJBK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 40109}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.79, "brand": "TCFHE/MGM", "asin": "B000KX0HIC", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51M87D5T6WL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Flyboys [Blu-ray]"}
{"description": "In his aim to make an honest film about sex, John Cameron Mitchell (Hedwig and the Angry Inch) has taken a somewhat documentary approach toShortbus, a film describing various New Yorkers' sexual pathos. Framed by shots roving a homemade diorama of the city,Shortbusis comprised of vignettes featuring actors who helped craft this story of people's disconnect in sexual endeavors. Jamie (PJ DeBoy) and James (Paul Dawson), a gay couple experiencing a lull in their relationship, visit Sophia (Sook-Yin Lee), a sex therapist whose inability to orgasm results in her clients inviting her to a sex club after which the film is titled. Sophia's husband, Rob (Raphael Barker), is also willing to experiment, so the two independently embark on adventures in self-pleasure. Dominatrix Severin (Lindsay Beamish) plays a crucial role in Sophia and Rob's lives, as her search for real humanity overlaps with their desire for passion. As each character's plot complicates, the viewer sees a similar melancholy bulldozing its way into these seemingly disparate lives. The depression is repeatedly used in comedic scenes, such as when James is asked on a date while still hospitalized for his attempted suicide. Yo La Tengo's score, which includes Animal Collective among others, lends this film a graceful ambience. Unlike porn,Shortbushas a resonance that encourages the viewer to consider one's own sex life as an important aspect of happiness.--Trinie Dalton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001AZKB8K", "B000BGH29K", "B003B2UK1S", "B00003JRAV", "B00005QW5X", "B0009VRHLK", "B000FZEQCS", "B0015FHDWM", "B00069A6CC", "B00GHP8SH4", "B000L6S92E", "B00HHYF5EI", "B00INUK5WM", "B000DZ95MG", "B00023P4I8", "B00996RSYM", "B00HW3F1IO", "B00GWWV1XU", "B00JJRLG7G", "B003XKNGNW", "B0076ANKUY", "B00I4CWIVU", "B00JVQ7QTM", "B00AWQEK26", "B0000BWVD9", "B00BJSLNN0", "B0084BM7NK", "B0007TZHWA", "B0009WDVUK", "B002R3CQDC", "B00KI1VXT8", "B0007OCG5G", "B00F98FOPE", "B00HQKREFG", "B00I567EWS", "B004GBMVTW", "B00064AFF0", "B004L03B3S", "B005GM38MO", "B00GSA3K6C", "B001PYD0LQ", "B00I2U91Z0", "B00368PSNC", "B0013D8LCW", "B00E849QSG", "B002L1YGRY", "B0080JX4Y2", "B00F878KAC", "B00HUTPKA4", "B0083V2VYG", "B00GPPXNIK", "B00IJZMZW4", "B00AZAJXOE", "B0002JZT5A", "B002JCYSL4", "B00IA7MFEO", "B00JVQ7PWU", "B0004Z32NI", "B000059XTM", "B00177Y9TS", "B00B022GVS", "B001RVQPPU", "B00HLTYRUM", "B00DUJH8V2", "B00JDOQMH4", "B0002I84JO", "B00099415C", "0780629167", "B000UYBP7S", "B0042L0OG8", "B001R4KAI0", "B00KRFE9UK", "B000ETRCMQ", "0783230559", "B00C8CQ5SO", "B00JDOQMIS", "B008N25X7M", "B000NVT0UM", "B00008UALE", "B008JFX04G", "B00J925RX0", "B00FGG60XY", "B00FPVGWY2", "B00AKLLSNC", "B000U95N9E", "B00F2RNAUI", "B005TIK4SQ", "0780022823", "B00005JMIJ", "B000AYELEC", "B00IMFRKIU", "B00AY6PK5A", "B009SFR2QI", "B005OTQIK8", "B00003CY27", "B002T4GY4Q"], "bought_together": ["B001AZKB8K", "B000BGH29K"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001AZKB8K", "B00003JRAV", "B000BGH29K", "B00GPPXNIK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 20842}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 39.0, "brand": "THINKFILM LLC", "asin": "B000LAZDQA", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61q20cKX4vL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Shortbus (Unrated Edition)"}

{"description": "Much was written about Will Ferrell's first \"dramatic role\" as Harold Crick, an IRS auditor who begins hearing a voice narrating his life. ButStranger Than Fictionis hardly a drama. However, what Ferrell does--like Jim Carrey before him inThe Truman Show--is handle a toned-down character with genuineness and affection: you believe he is this guy. Crick leads a lonely life filled with numbers and routines. While at first he considers the voice a nuisance, Crick decides more action is needed when it speaks of \"his demise.\" Enter Professor Jules Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman), who takes on the absurd notion with revelry, trying to find out what kind of book Crick's life is leading. It turns out that the voice Crick is hearing belongs to Kay Eiffel (Emma Thompson), a very real--and troubled--author who is writing a book in which Crick is a fictional character. As usual with these things, the stuffed shirt learns to live a better life--Crick even falls for one of his audits, a brash baker named Ana (Maggie Gyllenhaal). Marc Foster (Monster's Ball, Finding Neverland) has the right tone for the film, using great urban scenes (the unnamed city is Chicago) with interesting visualizations of Crick's world of numbers. He also directs Ferrell, Hoffman, and Gyllenhaal to their most charming performances (plus Linda Hunt and Tom Hulce pop up in two funny scenes). Ferrell succeeds in being a romantic lead you can root for; a scene where he eats Ana's freshly baked cookies is totally delightful without a hint of sarcasm. Screenwriter Zach Helm has two personal traits with his story: like Crick he followed his heart (he stopped rewriting scripts and only worked on his own) and like Eiffel, the final results are not a masterpiece, but good, and entertaining enough.

{"description": "Martin Scorsese makes a welcome return to the mean streets (of Boston, in this case) withThe Departed, hailed by many as Scorsese's best film sinceCasino. Since this crackling crime thriller is essentially a Scorsese-stamped remake of the acclaimed 2002 Hong Kong thrillerInfernal Affairs, the film was intensely scrutinized by devoted critics and cinephiles, and while Scorsese's intense filmmaking and all-star cast deserve ample acclaim,The Departedis also worthy of serious re-assessment, especially with regard to what some attentive viewers described as sloppy craftsmanship (!), notably in terms of mismatched shots and jagged continuity. But no matter where you fall on the Scorsese appreciation scale, there's no denying thatThe Departedis a signature piece of work from one of America's finest directors, designed for maximum impact with a breathtaking series of twists, turns, and violent surprises. It's an intricate cat-and-mouse game, but this time the cat and mouse are both moles: Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) is an ambitious cop on the rise, planted in the Boston police force by criminal kingpin Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a hot-tempered police cadet who's been artificially disgraced and then planted into Costello's crime operation as a seemingly trustworthy soldier. As the multilayered plot unfolds (courtesy of a scorching adaptation byKingdom of Heavenscreenwriter William Monahan), Costigan and Sullivan conduct a volatile search for each other (they're essentially looking for \"themselves\") while simultaneously wooing the psychiatrist (Vera Farmiga) assigned to treat their crime-driven anxieties.Such convenient coincidences might sink a lesser film, butThe Departedis so electrifying that you barely notice the plot-holes. And while Nicholson's profane swagger is too much \"Jack\" and not enough \"Costello,\" he's still a joy to watch, especially in a film that's additionally energized by memorable (and frequently hilarious) supporting roles for Alec Baldwin, Mark Wahlberg, and a host of other big-name performers.The Departedalso makes clever and plot-dependent use of cell-phones, to the extent that it couldn't exist without them. Powered by Scorsese's trademark use of well-chosen soundtrack songs (from vintage rock to Puccini's operas),The Departedmay not be perfect, but it's one helluva ride for moviegoers, proving popular enough to become the biggest box-office hit of Scorsese's commercially rocky career.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002ZG99N6", "B000P0J09M", "B004SIP7TE", "B004SIP8ZM", "B002ZG980U", "B002VWNIEA", "B00011CZRE", "B00AEBB8NI", "B002T9H2LA", "B00005JLSB", "B000MZHW40", "B00080ZG10", "B003ASLJQS", "B000P0J0AG", "B000P0J0EW", "B000C20VPA", "B003UESJHO", "B004SIP7ZS", "B003ASLJO0", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B002CPMB9O", "B00AHTYI5M", "B00275EGWY", "B000XR9L50", "B000A3XY5A", "B0007DFJ0G", "B001N44BVQ", "B00003CXWV", "B008MILL8W", "B000286RP2", "B004SIP7VM", "B00005V9HH", "6305313687", "B00AEBB9NM", "B004FQX5B6", "B00AEFXKUI", "B004SIP95G", "B00AEBB86A", "B005LAIIJY", "B0016Q2D66", "B003ASLJQI", "B00008975Z", "B000IY04Q8", "B001P9KR8U", "B00005JNJV", "B000C20VRS", "B008R65XYC", "B005LAIGRS", "B00H9KKGTO", "B00008DP4C", "B00AEBB9F0", "B00AEFY5B6", "B00005JN0W", "B005LAIGLE", "B000A2UBN4", "B002QEHPQU", "B000P0J0EM", "B003UESJH4", "B007D5E7C2", "6304765258", "B000P0J0D8", "B00AEFY0XE", "B00004WG2F", "0767830555", "B000LC55F2", "B002O3Z4Y8", "B004EPYZP8", "B000A7DVR2", "B00005JPD0", "B000WZEZGI", "B00049QQHI", "B000FS9FCG", "B00004XPPB", "B006OFN0SE", "B009AMAL4Y", "B004U7MR14", "B000GFLKF8", "B003AWRMCE", "B0019L770A", "B00BEIYN9Q", "B0000AM6JI", "B004SIP9Z6", "B001GZ6QC4", "0783240295", "B0010DR4BO", "B000065U1N", "B00001ZWUS", "B00BB67UNW", "B0000B1OFL", "B00AEBB9K0", "B00DHDDE32", "B00005JKWX", "B0051MKNV8", "B002ZG97RE", "0767802519", "B0034G4P94", "B00DHHWXYY", "B00005B6JZ", "B00003CXZ4", "B001TODCII"], "bought_together": ["B000P0J09M"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000RETOHY", "B000P0J09M", "B000P0J0EW", "B00AEBB8NI"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 5067}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.5, "brand": "Warner Bros", "asin": "B000M341QE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RZnzpL34L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "Thematically ambitious and emotionally complex, Clint Eastwood'sFlags of Our Fathersis an intimate epic with much to say about war and the nature of heroism in America. Based on thenon-fiction bestsellerby James Bradley (with Ron Powers), and adapted byMillion Dollar Babyscreenwriter Paul Haggis (Jarheadscreenwriter William Broyles Jr. wrote an earlier draft that was abandoned when Eastwood signed on to direct), this isn't so much a conventional war movie as it is a thought-provoking meditation on our collective need for heroes, even at the expense of those we deem heroic. In telling the story of the six men (five Marines, one Navy medic) who raised the American flag of victory on the battle-ravaged Japanese island of Iwo Jima on February 23rd, 1945, Eastwood takes us deep into the horror of war (in painstakingly authentic Iwo Jima battle scenes) while emphasizing how three of the surviving flag-raisers (played by Adam Beach, Ryan Phillippe, and Jesse Bradford) became reluctant celebrities &#x96; and resentful pawns in a wartime publicity campaign &#x96; after their flag-raising was immortalized by Associated Press photographer Joe Rosenthal in the most famous photograph in military history.As the surviving flag-raisers reluctantly play their public roles as \"the heroes of Iwo Jima\" during an exhausting (but clearly necessary) wartime bond rally tour,Flags of Our Fathersevolves into a pointed study of battlefield valor and misplaced idolatry, incorporating subtle comment on the bogus nature of celebrity, the trauma of battle, and the true meaning of heroism in wartime. Wisely avoiding any direct parallels to contemporary history, Eastwood allows us to draw our own conclusions about the Iwo Jima flag-raisers and how their postwar histories (both noble and tragic) simultaneously illustrate the hazards of exploited celebrity and society's genuine need for admirable role models during times of national crisis.Flags of Our Fathersdefies the expectations of those seeking a more straightforward war-action drama, but it's richly satisfying, impeccably crafted film that manages to be genuinely patriotic (in celebrating the camaraderie of soldiers in battle) while dramatizing the ultimate futility of war. Eastwood's follow-up film,Letters from Iwo Jima, examines the Iwo Jima conflict from the Japanese perspective.--Jeff ShannonBeyondFlags of Our FathersOther World War II DVDsEssential DVDs by Director Clint EastwoodFlags of Our Fathersby James BradleyStills fromFlags of Our Fathers(click for larger image)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JPKE", "B00555ZTRY", "B000SK5Z2A", "B00AEBBA36", "B000AAF27G", "B001DSNEJM", "B00D3LA63Y", "B001IBIHQ4", "B00AEBB8QK", "B00001ZWUS", "B000F5WR4W", "B00AEBB9UU", "B00004X13T", "B00005JK8K", "B00005PJ8T", "B00C2R11Y8", "B0021L8V2A", "B004U7MQWY", "B0002WT4OE", "B000009RBL", "B00979KQD6", "B00HF98SHG", "B0015D20FE", "B000F4PDF8", "B004SIP9X8", "B00006CXSS", "B00003CXTG", "B004GJYRA0", "B003AT9D74", "0553384155", "B0071HPP3M", "B000065U1N", "B00AEFXVCU", "0553111337", "B0002V7ON8", "0792839730", "B000095WW8", "B003ASLJOU", "B001LXIDWM", "B000NTPG7A", "B0002ISG9W", "B000LAZE8C", "B000P0J09C", "B000EHSVS2", "B00005PJ8S", "B00B0U2SFE", "B008XJ0J8I", "B00275EGWY", "B000DZIGDU", "B00K2CHX9C", "B00005JKTP", "0440229200", "B00AEFXRRO", "B00AEBB86U", "B000EHSVSC", "B005LAIGYQ", "B0007TKNM4", "B0007TKNGA", "B00004XPPG", "B003ASLJO0", "B00003CXHJ", "B001TUZG4K", "B001FB55L2", "B005GYSV4M", "B00AEFXVOI", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00AZNEW5G", "B00L4K450G", "B00096S4B2", "B00008K76U", "B003ELKNH2", "B003ASLJMW", "B00005JA9F", "B00004XPPC", "B00BL9MOPS", "B000FJGWBC", "B00HEPE6MM", "0767802470", "B000FVQLRA", "B002T9H2LA", "B00005N5S3", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B002O3Z510", "B00005OSJQ", "B005LAIGN2", "B003AWRMA6", "B000P0J0EW", "B002O3Z4WU", "B00J11U54K", "079284646X", "B000ELL1R6", "B007S0DCUU", "B002O3Z4Z2", "B00DL48BM6", "B00096S4BM", "0792841409", "B003ASLJPE", "B0007TKNLA", "0792838408", "B00AEFYENK"], "bought_together": ["B00005JPKE", "B00AEBBA36"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00001ZWUS", "B00006CXSS", "B00005JPKE", "B000P1XITE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 11870}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.88, "brand": "Paramount Home Video", "asin": "B000M4RG42", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51w01CgEgRL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Flags of Our Fathers (Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "If you're still eating that fast-food burger after watchingSuper Size Me, you might not feel too hungry after watchingFast Food Nation, a fictionalized feature based on Eric Schlosser's bestselling nonfiction expose. Director Richard Linklater, who cowrote the screenplay with Schlosser, guides a topnotch ensemble cast through a peek behind the veil of how that Big Mac is born. Much of the film focuses on the illegal immigrants who work in the loosely regulated meat-packing industry, and actors including the luminous Catalina Sandino Moreno (Maria Full of Grace), who plays a desperate but outraged laborer. Greg Kinnear also delivers a spot-on performance as a fast-food chain marketing manager, trying frantically to discover the source of stomach-turning contamination in the company's meat. Stories are woven in unexpected ways, and cameos by the likes of Kris Kristofferson, Patricia Arquette, and especially Bruce Willis keep the narrative fresh. The film has a point of view, but thanks to Linklater's deft touch, is never didactic. As Willis's character slyly says, \"Most people don't like to be told what's best for them.\" Agreed, yetFast Food Nationlikely will help the viewer be more conscious of what's on the end of that fork. --A.T.
