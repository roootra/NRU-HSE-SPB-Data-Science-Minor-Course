{"description": "Every American knows that George Washington crossed the icy Delaware River in the War of Independence, if only from Emanuel Gottlieb Leutze's famous 1851 painting. The made-for-cable-TV historical dramaThe Crossing, scripted by Howard Fast from his novel, corrects at least one piece of historical invention--Washington did not stand and pose for the occasion of Leutze's portrait--but, more importantly, it frames the event in the real-life drama that made it a decisive moment of American history. Jeff Daniels makes a fine General George Washington, the quiet, dignified, and increasingly desperate leader of the volunteer Continental Army. By December 1776, six months after the Declaration of Independence was signed, the tired and hungry army had retreated to the far banks of the Delaware River, a mere fraction of the original 20,000-strong force. Knowing that defeat means the end of the revolution, Washington takes the offensive in a dangerous surprise attack that turns the tide of the war. Like the sprawling Civil War epicGettysburg,The Crossingtakes one incident of the Revolutionary War and digs into the whys and wherefores that make it vital history. It lacks scope and spectacle--major battles appear more like modest skirmishes--and lapses into patriotic fervor at times, but it brims with rich historical detail and comes alive with the stories of officers, soldiers, and a very human George Washington.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303343872"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 363401}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 7.77, "brand": "", "asin": "0767023765", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/7112N5K5Q8L._SY300_.gif", "title": "The Crossing [VHS]"}

{"description": "Philadelphiawasn't the first movie about AIDS (it followed such worthy independent films asParting GlancesandLongtime Companion), but it was the first Hollywood studio picture to take AIDS as its primary subject. In that sense,Philadelphiais a historically important film. As such, it's worth remembering that director Jonathan Demme (Melvin and Howard,Something Wild,The Silence of the Lambs) wasn't interested in preaching to the converted; he set out to make a film that would connect with a mainstream audience. And he succeeded.Philadelphiawas not only a hit, it also won Oscars for Bruce Springsteen's haunting &quot;The Streets of Philadelphia,&quot; and for Tom Hanks as the gay lawyer Andrew Beckett who is unjustly fired by his firm because he has AIDS. Denzel Washington is another lawyer (functioning as the mainstream-audience surrogate) who reluctantly takes Beckett's case and learns to overcome his misconceptions about the disease, about those who contract it, and about gay people in general. The combined warmth and humanism of Hanks and Demme were absolutely essential to making this picture a success. The cast also features Jason Robards, Antonio Banderas (as Beckett's lover), Joanne Woodward, and Robert Ridgely, and, of course, those Demme regulars Charles Napier, Tracey Walter, and Roger Corman.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B000003KHS", "6301792734"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 602343}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 0.9, "brand": "", "asin": "0767809270", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51PPAS4K30L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Philadelphia [VHS]"}
{"description": "Penny Marshall's popular 1992 comedy sheds light on a little-known chapter of American sports history with its story of a struggling team in the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. The league was formed when the recruiting of soldiers during World War II resulted in a shortage of men's baseball teams. The AAGPBL continued after the war (until 1954), and Marshall's movie depicts the league in full swing, beginning when a savvy baseball scout (Jon Lovitz) finds a pair of promising new players in small-town Oregonian sisters (Geena Davis, Lori Petty). The sisters are signed to play for the Rockford Peaches near Chicago, whose new manager (Tom Hanks) is a former home-run king who wrecked his career with alcoholism. They're all a bunch of underdogs, and Marshall (with a witty script by Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel) does a fine job of establishing a colorful team of supporting players including Madonna and (in her movie debut) Rosie O'Donnell. It's a conventional Hollywood sports story (Marshall's never been one to take dramatic risks), but the stellar cast is delightful, and the movie's filled with memorable moments, witty dialogue, and agreeable sentiment. And just remember: there's no crying in baseball!--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783235968", "630141277X", "6302534372", "0767809262", "6303506291", "B00005M20M", "0792151712"], "also_viewed": ["B000003KMM", "B0012GMZZY", "630596260X", "0783235968", "B00B4804KS"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 393057}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.17, "brand": "", "asin": "076780922X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51A158TD4RL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "A League of Their Own [VHS]"}
{"description": "While most movie buffs are likely to callHalloweenthe best movie from John Carpenter, others--die-hard romantics and anyone who cried while watchingE.T.--might vote in favor of the director's 1984 hitStarman. It's easily Carpenter's warmest and most beguiling film, and the only one that ever earned an Oscar nomination. That honor went specifically to Best Actor nominee Jeff Bridges for his performance as an alien visitor to Earth who is knocked off course and must take an interstate road trip to rendezvous with a mothership from his home planet. To complete this journey he assumes the physical form of the dead husband of a Wisconsin widow (Karen Allen) who responds first with fear, then sympathy, and finally love. Carpenter's graceful strategy is to switch the focus of thisE.T.-like film from science fiction to a gentle road-movie love story, made believable by the memorable performances of Bridges and Allen. It's a bit heavy-handed with tenacious government agents who view the Starman as an alien threat (don't they always?), but Carpenter handles the action with intelligent flair, sensitivity, and lighthearted humor. If you're not choked up during the final scene, well, you just might not be human.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B007G8SEF2", "B000QXDCJ2", "B0024FADAQ", "B00005JKIS", "B00020HAV0", "630471193X", "B0001I562I", "6305869103", "B0000844I8", "B0000648ZQ", "B00020HAWE", "0783232047", "B005FQ2H8W", "B00009AOBK", "B002GOAGZC", "B00008438U", "B00AEFXT7W", "B0045HCJKS", "B005QX8U2Q", "B001BGS17Q", "B0003JANU0", "B003ASLJMW", "B000EHRVOW", "B002GHHHKQ", "B00000G3PA", "B004AOECXI", "B00AEFY3MC", "B0000UJDLM", "B0015NORDW", "B00004TX5G", "B00008G8LY", "B000065U1Q", "B00004W46I", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00008G8M4", "B00015YVD6", "B00005JKFR", "B001ECDVJU", "6305428506", "B0045HCJSA", "B00AEBB8VK", "B0087F7VSY", "B0013LL2Z2", "B0025VLELQ", "B002GHHHNI", "B00009AOBI", "B00005JPD0", "0767821467", "B000EHSVOG", "B00GJNQ4M0", "B000JU8H9C", "B00004YA66", "B00009PY3X", "B0068FZ0GK", "B0045HCJ9E", "B0002V7OI8", "B000VECAD0", "6305213283", "B000FO0A9W", "630542845X", "0784011338", "B000096IAC", "B004SIP6C2", "B0001NBLYK", "B00066FBQG", "0783225814", "B00000IQW5", "0800195175", "B00AEFY4CG", "6305236569", "6305308853", "B00009OWJY", "B000FO0AA6", "0792844866", "B000NJMJGG", "B000MDFTHE", "B00AEFYXJ0"], "bought_together": ["B0024FADAQ", "B000QXDCJ2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0024FADAQ", "B000QXDCJ2", "B000VECAD0", "B000OA8OK4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 15141}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.38, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "0767812166", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5111TSVWTWL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Starman"}
{"description": "This thoroughly unpleasant thriller from the hands of Joel Schumacher (Batman and Robin) offers very little in its lurid tour of snuff films and the seedy pornographic underworld. A wooden Nicolas Cage stars as a private detective hired by a tycoon's widow, who discovers in her dead husband's safe some 8mm footage of a young girl being sexually abused and slaughtered. Cage's job is to determine the veracity of the film and to find out the girl's identity, whether she be alive or dead. What could have been a taut, nerve-jangling thriller is instead a lumbering, overwrought but underwritten tale of vigilante justice. Screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker also penned the imaginative and compellingSeven, but you wouldn't know it from this tired and monotonous script. Schumacher tries for echoes of bothThe Silence of the Lambsand Paul Schrader'sHardcore(which stars George C. Scott as a father trying to find his daughter in the seedy porn industry), but despite some slick camerawork, the film fails to draw the audience into either the mystery of the missing girl or Cage's supposed internal conflicts. It's not so much the unsavory subject matter as it is the sloppy and unimaginative filmmaking that makes the movie unbearable. Of the entire cast only Joaquin Phoenix, as a charismatic goth boy who works at an adult book store, comes away with a memorable performance.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00003JRAB", "0783223218", "6303486746", "630470786X", "6302479487", "6304826133", "6301966899"], "also_viewed": ["B00012F6A6"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 474128}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.95, "brand": "", "asin": "076781956X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5136N2XDYBL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "8mm [VHS]"}

The film exhibits some extraordinary sound design, and the finale features a magical encapsulation of Beethoven's life and loves set to his \"Ode to Joy.\" As an exciting and passionate journey,Immortal Belovedis its own masterpiece.--Robert Lane", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 614366}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.9, "brand": "", "asin": "0767824407", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515AXXJZF6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Immortal Beloved [VHS]"}

Granted the formula has become familiar enough to allow parody, but Burns knows how to invest his historical investigations with movement and drama, making this four-hour journey a worthwhile trip.As narrated by Hal Holbrook, Dayton Duncan's script explicates the agenda presented by Thomas Jefferson to Meriwether Lewis and William Clark, placing it in the context of the young country's gamble in Jefferson's Louisiana Purchase, and the expedition's goals for opening the West. While preserving the heroic scale of the undertaking, Burns also finds time to delve into the politics of the venture and the disparate personalities of the two explorers; in particular, Duncan and Burns look at the career of Lewis, the presidential prot&eacute;g&eacute;, his moody demeanor, and his  untimely death.

{"description": "Director Ernest Dickerson injects a hearty dose of dark humor in this stylish comic-book horror tale. Based on the campy cable horror series (which was inspired by the 1950s E.C. comic book series of the same name), this tight, modestly budgeted little thriller stars William Sadler as an intense stranger who arrives at a run-down boarding house in flight from the Collector (a cocky, droll Billy Zane). The Collector is after an item in the stranger's possession, which turns out to be a holy relic, and when his efforts end in failure he explodes in a demonic fury that reveals his evil origins, laying siege to the house with an army of zombies and infiltrating the minds of each the boarders with insidious fantasies. It's a seedyGrand Hotelby way ofThe Exorcist, cooked up with plenty of gore and a smattering of sex, and served with dry wit. Dickerson effectively balances the horror and the humor, maintaining a surprising intensity and an unforced mythic dimension within lurid B-movie conventions.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783219199", "0792836685", "6303654282", "630018286X", "6300183211", "B000002J3O"], "bought_together": ["6303654282"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 326315}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.88, "brand": "", "asin": "0783214235", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51TDE4HESDL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Tales From Crypt: Demon Knight [VHS]"}
{"description": "In the vastly overrated 1998 bookEasy Riders, Raging Bulls, author Peter Biskind puts the blame for Hollywood's blockbuster mentality at least partially on Steven Spielberg's box-office success with this adaptation of Peter Benchley's bestselling novel. But you can't blame Spielberg for making a terrific movie, whichJawsdefinitely is. The story of a Long Island town whose summer tourist business is suddenly threatened by great-white-shark attacks on humans bypasses the potboiler trappings of Benchley's book and goes straight for the jugular with beautifully crafted, crowd-pleasing sequences of action and suspense supported by a trio of terrific performances by Roy Scheider (as the local sheriff), Richard Dreyfuss (as a shark specialist), and particularly Robert Shaw (as the old fisherman who offers to hunt the shark down). The sequences on Shaw's boat--as the three of them realize that in fact the shark is huntingthem--are what entertaining moviemaking is all about.--Marshall Fine", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005B6ND", "6300183181", "0784011923", "0767825411", "6305814694", "B00000JGEI", "6303148352", "6303506291", "630018403X", "B00000490M", "6300214753", "6304932553", "630442972X", "6300269639", "B0000048S1", "B000005PFL", "6302765536", "6302091632", "6302824729", "6303344224", "6301570723", "6300247171", "B00008WFU5", "6305576173", "6300183467", "0790743213", "6304143184", "6303402348", "1558808221", "6303020089", "B000063UUL", "B00005B238", "6303212379", "B00005A8XX", "0790731436", "0783226152", "0790705141", "6300267881", "B00008WFU4", "6300181340", "630157401X", "6302921058", "6300214060", "6302968143", "1558802258", "0792102320", "6300214087", "6300268993", "B0000BWVBD", "B002GHHHL0", "6301888901", "B00005JKDQ", "6303122647", "6302800420", "6303610811", "6301827732", "6303540082", "6302374189", "0800198395", "6300214435", "6304071876", "6301208773", "B00000IO4G", "B00006G8LB", "B0087ZG7HK", "B00008DZ83", "6300214710", "6300215814", "630220366X", "6304457324", "0800116917", "B000059XY5", "6303212263", "6300216500", "6303236863", "630533577X", "6300213986", "6302415853", "6304935811", "6302820448", "B00004U8P4", "6300214311", "6301798503", "0793927501", "6300214370", "6302787564", "6304288433", "6300182878", "B000003KHS", "6301971809", "B000007OY0", "0790734079", "630336568X", "0790733927", "0790742322", "6301966988", "0764006770", "B000059XVO", "B00023BLXA"], "also_viewed": ["B00008WFU5", "6301792734", "6305814694", "B00005B6ND", "0784011923", "0767825411", "6300214060", "6300183181", "6300247171", "B00005A8XX", "6303506291", "B00006AL1C", "0792151712", "6304539258", "630018403X", "6305363668", "B00008WFU4", "B00000JGEI", "B00078XGO2", "6304117752", "6301574117", "0800116917", "B000005PPB", "B0056BE0SG", "6302091632", "080010367X", "6304143184", "6300216845", "6304539274", "6303148352", "0792158261", "B00000JS61", "0792839846", "6303212379", "0792837614", "0783222955", "0783221347", "0790700506", "6302921058", "6301797906", "6301976983", "6305123616", "6303402070", "6304429274", "1558807780", "B00005JKDQ", "6300214370", "6302936381", "B00000JGEK", "B0000AQZYM", "B00000JXVM", "B0007KTBIU", "0790734079", "6304039522", "6300214753", "B00005NCCP", "B005FHWWXQ", "B0087F7VSY", "B00KDU8HQQ"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 177995}, "asin": "0783216084", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514JQY1K3TL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Jaws [VHS]"}

The ghosts (Kyra Sedgwick, Charles Grodin, Alfre Woodard, Tom Sizemore) all have unfinished business in this world before they can move on to the next, and Downey's character agrees to let them inhabit his body while they sort it all out. The appealing cast alone strongly recommends this movie, but Downey's remarkable facility for physical comedy--manifesting the personalities of his supernatural pals as they possess him--is a riot. Elisabeth Shue makes the best of her part as the hero's girlfriend;Leaving Las Vegaswas still ahead of her, but one can see her talent straining to get out here.

Based on Michael Crichton's novel about an island amusement park populated by cloned dinosaurs, the film works best as a thrill ride with none of the interesting human dynamics of Spielberg'sJaws.

{"description": "If you're into sword-and-sorcery tales, look no further than this critically underrated big-screen fantasy based on the fiction ofConan the Barbariancreator Robert E. Howard. It was a troubled production and the outcome is far different from the more serious and intelligent epic that screenwriter Charles Pogue had originally conceived. Still, this is a giddy, energetic throwback to the Ray Harryhausen movie fantasies of the 1950s and '60s, and it's a perfect vehicle for Kevin Sorbo, the hunky star of TV'sHercules: The Legendary Journeys. Sorbo brings an appropriate combination of depth and physical agility to the role of Kull (son of Conan), but he and director John Nicolella know better than to take this stuff too seriously. The movie's humor is nicely integrated into the dialogue without resorting to lame punch lines, and Tia Carrere is enjoyably campy as the evil goddess who lures Kull from his favorite concubine (Karina Lombard) as she plots to overthrow the kingdom of Valusia. Playwright Harvey Fierstein also provides comic relief in a scene-stealing role, and with an abundance of black magic, stunning Slovakian locations, and grand battles of good versus evil, this heroic adventure is more entertaining than you might expect.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0001Z37HM", "B000056WR3", "B0009HI5KQ", "B0000VD12I", "B001W72VPW", "B0006GAOP4", "0783225946", "B00376AVHQ", "B000NQFRU4", "B002GHHHOM", "B00466H3CC", "B00AMDA2P8", "B000LRZHRI", "B006LG74RE", "B00344EAKA", "B002JHDBUS", "0306820366", "B00AEFXT7W", "B000TGJ826", "B00CHMBQM0", "B000V5EYXS", "0783241895", "B0062KMDPM", "B004ZKKKXI", "B00EU8RBXW", "B001AR0D5Y", "B004EPYZT4", "B003ZFC9M4", "B000A6T1ZE", "B004U7MQYC", "B00004TJJV", "078322625X", "B00DS79HBU", "B0006J28MS", "B003H9LIRK", "B00509KXVC", "B00CQ8U6A8", "B004U7MQY2", "B00AMDA2QC", "B0048FUUAI", "B004HYW84G", "B00J4LMHMK", "B00005QVZ1", "0767847431", "B00D3LA7G0", "B00B2203PM", "B0000WN0SW", "0783225814", "B0007OCG5Q", "B003DVNUUK", "B00K0D9760", "B001DZOCY6", "B00076ONT6", "B0087Q24A8", "B00JLDT9UE", "B0002C9DJU", "B0042YZFYG", "B008EFDC6M", "B0010YVCAM", "B005IX3C5E", "B006LG74Q0", "0345490177", "0783225830", "B00AGKHC3C", "B00F9IMX8U", "B001K2KM8C", "B0038ZITIE", "B0068MNO02", "B000GIXEIG", "B009XJVKKS", "B006ZGROB6", "B00BTYMPUY", "B00CHMBQNE", "B00094ARU0", "B001DB6J50", "B000VKL6ZM", "B003C5FMNK", "B000MGUZCU", "B00HNTOVX8", "0345461533", "B00IJS2OXG", "B004B93RDS", "B000QXDCJ2", "6305558167", "B00C2PO14C", "B0001NBMIK", "B000R9U3B0", "B00ECXJC28", "0345461525", "B0024FADAQ", "078321958X", "B0007DA3VG", "B00406UK7S", "B002ZG977Y", "B000A2LV4W", "B007XTDXF0", "B004VT9JLC", "B000JLTRHW", "B00HWWUQWQ"], "bought_together": ["B0001Z37HM", "B001W72VPW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0001Z37HM", "0783225946", "0783241895", "B000056WR3"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 97305}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.41, "brand": "UNIVERSAL", "asin": "0783225741", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51316T4AQ5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Kull the Conqueror"}
{"description": "Conan the Barbarian, the movie that turned Arnold Schwarzenegger into a global superstar, is a prime example of a match made in heaven. It's the movie that macho maverick writer-director John Milius was born to make, and Arnold was genetically engineered for his role as the muscle-bound, angst-ridden hero created in Robert E. Howard's pulp novels. Oliver Stone contributed to Milius's screenplay, and the production design by comic artist Ron Cobb represents a perfect cinematic realization of Howard's fantasy world. To avenge the murder of his parents, Conan tracks down the evil Thulsa Doom (James Earl Jones) with the help of Queen Valeria (played by buff B-movie vixen Sandahl Bergman) and Subotai the Mongol (Gerry Lopez).

{"description": "A movie that only true horror buffs could love,Army of Darknessis officially part 3 in the wild and wacky Evil Dead trilogy masterminded by the perversely inventive director Sam Raimi, who would later serve as executive producer of the popular syndicated TV seriesHercules: The Legendary Journeys.Raimi's favorite actor, Bruce Campbell, returns as Ash (hero of the first two Evil Dead flicks), a hardware-store clerk who is magically transported--along with his beat-up Oldsmobile and a chainsaw attachment for his severed left forearm--to the brutal battlefields of the 14th century. He quickly assumes power (who else in the Middle Ages packs a shotgun and a chainsaw?), and unites his band of medieval knights against the dreaded Army of the Dead. Raimi gleefully subverts almost every horror-movie clich&eacute; as he serves up a nonstop parade of blood, gore, and vicious sword-bearing skeletons--an affectionate homage to animator Ray Harryhausen's classicJason and the Argonauts. The frantic action is fun while it lasts, but even at 80 minutesArmy of Darknessnearly wears out its welcome. You know that Raimi can maintain the mayhem for only so long before it grows tiresome, and fortunately this madcap movie quits while it's ahead.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B005J9ZFQG", "B000WC3864", "B008JFUNYG", "B001KEGR5M", "B0001LQJMQ", "B003S6S7TY", "B004GGU9K0", "B000QUCQX8", "B008CYDD7I", "B005J9ZE5I", "B00C6F61IW", "B004GGU9JQ", "B00004Y87O", "B000WC38FA", "B000AQ69QS", "B0006A9FKA", "B00IF8Q0YE", "B0013D8LAE", "B000RIWAVW", "B0002C9DK4", "B000F7CMPE", "B0001611DI", "B0000AOX0F", "B002LMSWN2", "B000FS9FE4", "B0002CHK1S", "157362408X", "B000IJ7A5Q", "B002GHHHG0", "B00D7AM6M0", "B000I2J68M", "B00009MGEM", "B001NPD9LS", "B00AQJ8MLY", "B000VKL6Z2", "B004SIP6LS", "B00007AJG4", "B002JT69IW", "0790729342", "B0009OUBC4", "B00005JA8B", "B001D5C1OO", "B000V4UFZK", "B00005LC4Q", "B0056P6SOG", "B004P7CMOQ", "B000UAE7O0", "B000WC389G", "B0016MJ6P6", "B000I0RNVQ", "B008WAM2E2", "B0001US7OA", "B00005N5RM", "B00AEFY2WI", "B000FJH5MC", "B000099T3M", "B004EI2NP4", "B00005JO16", "B008G33PIM", "B001DJLD1W", "B000TSIJWY", "B001DJLD0S", "B000AXWHSA", "B000FA57UI", "B00AEFXW8I", "B00018D42W", "B000068IEV", "B000S0GYRU", "B000FA57US", "6304712499", "B001B8XRT6", "B002VWNIDG", "B002OVO18A", "B0002ABURA", "B00006FDCD", "B00AEFYDM2", "B0028DRGDQ", "B008874968", "B0000AOX09", "B001KEGR5W", "B0000VCZNE", "0312291450", "B0087ZG7UW", "B0024FAG44", "B0053TWV46", "B0058I9DZM", "B003VMFWXO", "B003WTO5NO", "B0015U0QWG", "B004XVMCH6", "B004LWZW24", "B001B1UO6W", "B005HI4LMS", "B000LP6KNU", "B004SIP9Z6", "B00317LM8S", "B0031U8OEK", "B0024FADBA", "B000C20VRS"], "bought_together": ["B005J9ZFQG", "B000WC3864"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005J9ZFQG", "B00005R24K", "B008JFUNYG", "B009JBWOU0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 22777}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.74, "brand": "Universal Studios", "asin": "0783227434", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DQ0H428VL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Army of Darkness"}

{"description": "Unfairly dismissed by a number of critics,Two Minute Warningis  an absorbing contemplation of the phenomenon of violence. Based on a novel by George LaFountaine, the story concerns an anonymous (and, until the very end, faceless) sniper perched above the scoreboard at a championship football game in Los Angeles. His lack of identity and unstated motivation is key to the film's air of cautionary fable, in which the killer's rage is one end of a continuum that includes many different kinds of violence among numerous characters: emotional withdrawal, police brutality, subtle racism, chips on various shoulders. Produced in 1976, the movie has all the hallmarks of the decade's vogue for disaster flicks: an ensemble cast, a web of story lines, and a lot of people contained in one place where something awful happens. But it is also something more: a successful exercise in plastic storytelling, a clever interweaving of a dozen discrete subplots with a mix of documentary and original action footage. The explosiveness of the football game itself becomes a refrain of ritualized mayhem in director Larry Peerce's patchwork film, but without beating us over the head with its metaphorical obviousness.Two Minute Warningmay not be a great or classic work, but it is far more than the sum of its many parts and does leave a lasting impression.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEFXJF4", "0783229399", "B0033YFI6Q", "B000OHZJO6", "B000ETRA5U", "B0050MB5N4", "B00AFEYS9A", "0792843649", "B001KO1BCG", "B0006HBZBK", "B001PYD0PC", "B004OB2EYQ", "0783229372", "B00JJOY4RI", "B00008L3UQ", "B008SAPCTS", "B0003JANSW", "B003GWE582", "B000NTPG7K", "B005OT7ZWI", "B00005M2CO", "B00004XPPE", "B007HCI42A", "B00AEBB86U", "B000EHSVOG", "B0001FGBWK", "B0024FAG2Q", "B001NY4WYC", "0767824555", "B004GW49K0", "B00319ECCY", "B000HT38CQ", "B00005JMA5", "0783230346", "B0045HCJKS", "B0009GX1CE", "B001T21R50", "B004I1K05W", "B00G575PD4", "B00004ZBVG", "B00AIBZMD6", "B000P0J0BU", "B00005V9HJ", "B00008438U", "B00021R7CG", "B00005LIRC", "B0053ENPPA", "B003A0H04Q", "B0007ZEOC8", "B000QUCRB4", "B00005YUNO", "B005152C9G", "B00AEFY6DI", "B00AEFY9YY", "B004MFFB4O", "B00AEFY0KW", "B0000AMRUP", "B00BWJQEFS", "B001CQONHM", "B000E6ESEO", "B00AEFYTMQ", "B00A50PDS4", "B004I1K066", "B00008G6E8", "B0001FGC1U", "B000N3SROA", "B000O599YY", "B000TUDBFC", "0792844017", "B000AQKU72", "B00018D3YG", "B00501SPQA", "B000EXDSCU", "B003GWF2QQ", "B0006B2A42", "6305161984", "B00BWJQEFI", "B000M341R8", "B003B3NV8G", "B00AEFYR3C", "B00006FD9O", "078323208X", "B001EKP5D2", "B00CSW0A8A", "B004VT9JMG", "B00AEFY3TA", "B005DL6PLY", "B0077HQCYM", "B003VJTGNE", "B00005LC4D", "B00BCMT2BI", "B000EHSVSC", "B00008MTVY", "B00BCMT3TO", "B00005UQ9T", "B002EAYDQ6", "B000F6ZIIS", "B00DOZNJ2Y", "B0007PALZW", "B00AEFXLKC"], "bought_together": ["B00AEFXJF4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AEFXJF4", "B00AEFYTMQ", "B0001FGC1U", "B0033YFI6Q"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 163962}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.41, "brand": "UNI DIST CORP.

All Quiet is an anthology of now famous scenes: Ayres trapped in a shell crater with a man he has killed; the first meeting of the recruits and the veterans; infantrymen being mowed down to machine-gun visual rhythms; a moonlight swim with French farmgirls; Ayres' pacifist speech to his astonished schoolmates; and the final shot of the soldier's hand reaching for a fatal butterfly.", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792841409", "B00AEFZDNA", "B000BYA4HE", "B00BTYJYR6", "B0009S4IKQ", "B00004TVUD", "B0006HBV3W", "B0000639EU", "B00005U8F4", "B00012FXJ0", "B00D9BNONW", "B00006RCO2", "B00011D1OK", "B0011FDVGI", "B00AATV07S", "B004HHX9XC", "B0000549B1", "B004SJVQ4I", "0780020707", "B00D3K357O", "B00004XPPC", "B00006RCO3", "B000BITV92", "0449213943", "B0002MHE1O", "B000HWZ4CA", "B0006GANN2", "B001GUYAZY", "B00011D1OU", "B00AEFY6DI", "B001DW2BIS", "B0046YK4KW", "B00006RCO1", "B000EHSVS2", "0792833287", "B000I6BJ56", "079284646X", "0767802470", "B000KX0IOA", "B001GLX6TY", "B0087ZG7OI", "B00AEBB9QY", "B000KJTGHO", "B00005J75F", "0764586718", "0780021312", "B00006ADD5", "B002VWNIAY", "B006TTC5HC", "B0009KNR42", "0792839730", "B00005PJ8S", "B00005JKF6", "6305918880", "B004VK74A4", "B0042FDCR2", "B005SQ3AO4", "B000LPR6GA", "B00049QQJQ", "B000XJD34I", "B00005AUKB", "B0000DJZ8R", "B00003CXBU", "B00008AOTN", "B00005PJ8T", "B0010AN7Z4", "B003ZEQMH8", "B0045HCJQM", "B0049985XW", "B0002V7ON8", "6304907729", "B00005AUKE", "B000M2E30O", "0143039040", "B000055Y0X", "B000LAZE8C", "B0050FXDDQ", "B001EOQCMG", "B0024FADBU", "B0001US8F8", "B0045HCJ8U", "B000FVQLRA", "B000BYA4II", "B001BEK8E2", "0792841662", "6305999872", "B0007OY2OY", "B00005N5S3", "B0040QYROA", "B001E18222", "B000O78L0U", "B00782O7IY", "B0000BWVCR", "B000MTEFWS", "B00B7U2GCC", "B00BY0EBK0", "B0010YSD7W", "B0045HCJJY", "B000O599NA", "B000EOTUSA"], "bought_together": ["0792841409", "B00BTYJYR6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0000639EU", "B00D9BNONW", "0792841409", "0449213943"]}, "price": 15.94, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 210011}, "asin": "0783230435", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41XEDT59ZJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "All Quiet on the Western Front"}
{"description": "You have to hand it to the walking dead. What they lack in speed and agility, they more than make up for in sheer single-minded determination. Im-Ho-Tep is a case in point. He's an ancient Egyptian priest, cursed for his terrible crimes against the gods. A team of British archaeologists digs up his sarcophagus, along with a box inscribed with a warning that opening it will unleash death and destruction. You'll never guess what they do. Once freed, Im-Ho-Tep takes on the appropriately evil alias Ardath Bey and gets to the task of resurrecting his ancient lover--which will, of course, require a living human surrogate. While the premise may sound formulaic,The Mummyin fact turns out to be bracingly weird, relying on atmospheric creepiness rather than on jump-out-and-scare-you effects. Boris Karloff gives a terrific performance as Im-Ho-Tep. He has all the malevolence the film requires, but also manages subtler touches; the expression in his eyes as he is wrapped in preparation for being buried alive is absolutely chilling. Instead of forcing him to do all the tedious shambling around that so many mummies resort to, the filmmakers have wisely given Im-Ho-Tep/Ardath Bey a nearly living appearance once he's cleaned up and has a few psychic powers to boot, making him a potent adversary. Stock up on ace bandages and prepare for a good spooky evening.--Ali Davis", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300181278", "6300183092", "6300181286", "6302120101", "6300183629", "630252542X", "6300185281", "6302843219", "6300185443", "6301005783", "6302841771", "6302526175", "6303626424", "6302526167", "6302526086", "630018529X", "6302841763", "630252587X", "6302526140", "6302526051", "6302843227", "6301257014", "6302841844", "6302843200", "6302526191", "630284178X", "6300181820", "6302526094", "6303129153", "0783235607", "0790736055", "6301327845", "6303129188", "6301967410", "6302194296", "630312917X", "6303129145", "5554306004", "6303129161", "6304507348", "6302841798", "0792835077", "6300247589", "6302120527", "B00007JME0", "B000HDNPM0", "6300182983", "6302491975", "6302503493", "6302814669", "0800116917"], "bought_together": ["6300181278", "6300183092"], "also_viewed": ["6300183629", "6300181286", "6300181278", "6300183092", "6300185281", "6300181820", "630018529X", "6302841763", "6302526140", "6302841771", "630252542X", "6300185443", "6302843219", "6302526094", "6302120101", "6301005783", "630252587X", "6303129188", "6302526051"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 363783}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.47, "brand": "", "asin": "0783234287", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51YBJJ5PEBL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Mummy [VHS]"}
{"description": "Released in late 1999,The Bone Collectorwas originally promoted as a thriller in the tradition ofThe Silence of the LambsandSeven, suggesting that it would earn a place among those earlier, better films. Nice try, but no cigar.The Bone Collectorsettles instead for mere competence and the modest rewards of a well-handled formula. With a terrific cast at his service, director Phillip Noyce (Dead Calm,Patriot Games) turns the pulpy indulgence of Jeffery Deaver's novel into a slick potboiler that is grisly fun only if you don't pick it apart.Noyce expertly builds palpable tension around a series of gruesome murders that lead us into the darkest nooks of New York City. Now a bedridden quadriplegic prone to life-threatening seizures and suicidal depression, forensics detective Lincoln Rhyme (Denzel Washington) gets a new lease on life with a sharp young beat cop (Angelina Jolie) who's a wizard at analyzing crime scenes. She does field work while he deciphers clues from his high-tech Manhattan loft, and as they narrow the search their lives are increasingly endangered. As this formulaic plot grows moldy, Noyce resorts to narrative shortcuts, using perfunctory scenes to manipulate the viewer and taking morbid pleasure in his revelation of the murder scenes. And yet it all works, to a point, and the cast (including Queen Latifah and Luiz Guzm&aacute;n) is much better than the material. If you're looking for a few good thrills,The Bone Collectoris a pretty safe bet.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEFXT1S", "B00AEFYF2K", "B00096S49Y", "B00AP2DC94", "B00011CZRE", "B002NZK5RI", "B00005JMWP", "B00AEFXEGS", "B00005JPD0", "B002GHHHN8", "B002AT8K9W", "B00015YVDG", "B002NZK5UU", "B00029RT9E", "6304884400", "6304765258", "B002NZK5VO", "0792159659", "B00009WVSL", "B000244GCC", "B002O3Z4ZW", "0790732149", "B00DHD933W", "B000GFLKF8", "B0050MB4OO", "B000OT6V0K", "B00AEBBA2W", "B0000VJG72", "B000JYW5BE", "B002NZK5R8", "B002AS464Q", "0790736411", "B00005JKWX", "B000QUCRB4", "B00006HAWN", "B001GKJ2E8", "B000CEV3M8", "6304711891", "B003ASLJIQ", "0767810872", "B00BTYOYG2", "6305428115", "B002AT8KAG", "0790730979", "B002LMV7R0", "B002O3Z4WK", "B00005JN0W", "B00006G8JD", "B00026ZD04", "B00004Z4WR", "B0043X1FNQ", "B005LAIGRS", "B00AEFYGBA", "B00005JLKN", "B004EPYZP8", "0800141806", "B0006HBZXS", "B0006GANOQ", "B000055Y0Y", "B00AEFYUQQ", "B000069HZP", "B00AEBB8LA", "B00005ATZT", "B002ZG997C", "B00005JA9F", "B00BTYU3W6", "0767803434", "B0021L8V0M", "B000244GCW", "B000ENC5YW", "B000R4SMCW", "B001KRVLCI", "B0045HCJFS", "B000P0J0C4", "B00000G3PA", "0783225547", "B00441GYXI", "B00AEFY4CG", "6304806434", "B00009L1TA", "B002GIBVVG", "B00AEFXYJA", "B002ZG99TA", "B0002V7OI8", "B00003CXGV", "B0050UEVNM", "0743491564", "B0045HCJ8K", "B003LR5BD0", "B00125WAWS", "B00000IQC4", "B0001FR3IQ", "6305718954", "B004A8ZX28", "B000G2YCVA", "B00005V4XV", "B001B3LIOC", "B00004BZIY", "6305767866"], "bought_together": ["B00AEFXT1S", "B00096S49Y"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AEFXT1S", "B00096S49Y", "B00AP2DC94", "B00005JPD0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 15287}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.55, "brand": "Universal Studios", "asin": "0783240295", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51H5Y1NXVWL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Bone Collector"}
{"description": "Suffering from the extreme bad luck of being released at the same time as the low-budgetThe Blair Witch Project, this adaptation ofThe Haunting of Hill Houseattempts to update Shirley Jackson's psychologically terrifying ghost story to the era of big-budget, computerized special effects. Does it work? Well, let's just say that showing isn't exactly the same as telling. A prime example of bloated studio filmmaking,The Hauntingtelegraphs all its frights so blatantly that it forsakes any of Jackson's subtle horrors for the remedial scares of a clunky carnival ride. The story remains basically the same, with four people called to an old mansion for experiments in the supernatural, but instead of getting inside the heads of its main characters (as the 1963 adaptation by Robert Wise did so well), Jan DeBont's film deserts character development for the huge, glorious set design provided by Eugenio Zanetti (Restoration). Thus, instead of a well-drawn story you get... a well-drawn house, one that four very talented and underutilized actors--Lili Taylor, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Liam Neeson, and Owen Wilson--wander around in endlessly (as Zeta-Jones puts it, the house is \"sort of Charles Foster Kane meets the Munsters\"). Taylor, as the hypersensitive Nell, is the unknowing lynchpin in the battle between good and bad ghosts and gets saddled with most of the expository dialogue of the mansion's gothic backstory. Zeta-Jones (showing some spark) and Neeson (showing none) are sadly reduced to providing reactionary shots of the film's disastrous climax, which mixes hapless new-age affirmations with computer-generated effects of ghosts and exploding windows, walls, doors, etc. For this haunted-house story, take a quick tour of the breathtaking rooms, but definitelydon'tstay the night.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00003CWRF", "B00005UQ9W", "B0045HCJJE", "B000063US5", "B003VA3JUO", "B002AS45VK", "B00AEBBA2W", "B0000C2IQQ", "B00005LIRD", "B002GHHHL0", "B00AEBBA72", "B00K2CHY1Y", "078322799X", "B004SIP92O", "B000V4UFZK", "B00AEFYXQI", "B00BEIYMAG", "B000CCBC9O", "B001BSBBGC", "B00E32PJ02", "B0000AOX0D", "B000UUX2Z0", "B000HC2LFI", "B0021L8UFI", "B00009PY4G", "0767824954", "B0010X73ZG", "B00AEBB91E", "0800177029", "B00AEFYYH6", "B0008191WO", "B00000IQVQ", "B00008LUNW", "B00003CXKM", "6305718954", "B00005JNY3", "B0002DB54A", "B004LWZW24", "B002VWNIDG", "B00DBNLBAQ", "0783116926", "B000GBEWRU", "0783225482", "B00AIBZLVY", "B004AC6PV2", "B0001FR3IQ", "B000GCFO0I", "B000NOIVT0", "B001B1872U", "B004P7CNUY", "B00004BZIY", "B00005JNBN", "B0009X763M", "B000NQRR1Q", "B00006FDCD", "B000AM6OQ2", "B00005O5B5", "0792839684", "B0000694XX", "B00000JQB5", "0780622650", "6305017115", "B003498SCQ", "1573625779", "B001B8XRT6", "B00000IQC4", "B00AEFXPMG", "6305300801", "B00EZ50SGW", "B00006AUIG", "B000TJ6PBK", "B0006SGYL0", "B004SIP9MY", "B001P3SA9Y", "B00023P4TM", "6305090564", "B000AM4P9K", "B00JPS7HOA", "B00B96TGQS", "B003UGLCIA", "B005LAIGOQ", "B004SIP9O2", "B00DZP1C9K", "B000ARXF96", "B004LWZW2O", "6305767866", "B002945DUW", "B000RIWAVW", "B000FFJYBG", "B00005JOWW", "B005TK23PQ", "B004XVMCN0", "B009XTF8KQ", "B001CFEC2Y", "B00006IUFV", "B00317LM8S", "B0021L8UPS", "B008874968", "6305428042", "B008JFUS0U"], "bought_together": ["B000063US5"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00BTYXNRI", "B0045HCJJE", "B000ASATYO", "0783116926"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 18281}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.84, "brand": "Dreamworks Skg", "asin": "0783237413", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51aYQx70GGL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Haunting"}
{"description": "Great period pictures make you feel as if you've stepped into another  era, heard its language, breathed its spirit, and come away with a fresh  perspective on that time as well as your own.Ride with the Devilis one  of those special films--why wasn't it more widely embraced by reviewers and  filmgoers? Did it rely too much on our patience for slow accumulation of  unforced rhythms and meanings (as opposed toThe Patriot, which \"moved\"  audiences with cattle-prod simplicity and manipulation)?Ride with the  Devil--smart, handsome, tenderly awed by how individual lives get ambushed  by history--is ripe for rediscovery.The Civil War of battlefields and plantation houses is nowhere to be seen  here. Instead we see the war as an improvised and largely blundering but very  bloody feud among neighbors in the border state of Missouri. In this bucolic war  zone--more than a little reminiscent of the Balkans in the late 1990s--the  Taiwanese-born director Ang Lee (Sense and Sensibility) traces the  destinies of several young Southern bushwhackers (guerrilla fighters) as they  experience violence, the seasons, and different kinds of love. Skeet Ulrich  draws the aristocratic glamour role (and top billing), but he's overshadowed by  Tobey Maguire as a first-generation American, the magnificent Jeffrey Wright (a  shameful oversight at Oscar time) as a freed slave fighting beside his former  master, and singer Jewel in a very natural acting debut as the young widow who  graces all their lives. The titleThe Birth of a Nationwas already  taken, but by the end of this movie you feel it would have applied here.-- Richard T.

Classical music-loving proto-punk Alex (Malcolm McDowell) and his \"Droogs\" spend their nights getting high at the Korova Milkbar before embarking on \"a little of the old ultraviolence,\" such as terrorizing a writer, Mr. Alexander (Patrick Magee), and gang raping his wife (who later dies as a result). After Alex is jailed for bludgeoning the Cat Lady (Miriam Karlin) to death with one of her phallic sculptures, Alex submits to the Ludovico behavior modification technique to earn his freedom; he's conditioned to abhor violence through watching gory movies, and even his adored Beethoven is turned against him. Returned to the world defenseless, Alex becomes the victim of his prior victims, with Mr. Alexander using Beethoven's Ninth to inflict the greatest pain of all. When society sees what the state has done to Alex, however, the politically expedient move is made.", "related": {"also_bought": ["0790734079", "0790705141", "B00004U8PA", "B00000FZCU", "6303953425", "6304484054", "0783235607", "6304039220", "630268644X", "B00006G8O1", "0790700506", "B0002G2B2W", "6305576173", "B000059HCI", "B00008X5J1", "0792837797", "B00000J2KZ", "6300267881", "6301977742", "6300216713", "6300269132", "B00000I1DI", "6302783356", "6300214826", "6305095566", "B00005JLET", "6302054982", "0800103106", "6302201845", "6302798450", "B00000J2L7", "6304994540", "6303686796", "B00005PJ8I", "6300216500", "0783228317", "6303107338", "6304935811", "B00004W5UA", "6302610702", "0783246641", "6300183211", "6302921058", "0792842111", "B00004T37H", "B00002E285", "B00003CXE6", "B000007OY0", "6301971582", "6300184064", "B00005LL26", "0790736039"], "bought_together": ["0790734079", "0790705141"], "also_viewed": ["0393312836", "0790705141", "B0013FSXT6", "B00GGAK0FS", "B008RO875Q", "B004O724M2", "B00004TLMC", "B00023NRSM", "B008M4MB8K", "6305440093", "6303953425", "6303939015", "6303148387", "6303861733", "B00003CXB4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 296220}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.95, "brand": "", "asin": "0790701022", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51EV1DQCCGL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "A Clockwork Orange"}
{"description": "Steven Spielberg, proving he's one of the few modern filmmakers who has the visual fluency to be capable of making a great silent film, took a melodramatic, D.W. Griffith-inspired approach to filming Alice Walker's novel. His tactics made the film controversial, but also a popular hit. You can argue with the appropriateness of Spielberg's decision, but his astonishing facility with images is undeniable--from the exhilarating and eye-popping opening shots of children playing in paradisiacal purple fields to the way he conveys the brutality of a rape by showing hanging leather belts banging against the head of the shaking bed. In a way it's a shame that Whoopi Goldberg, a stage monologist who made her screen debut in this movie, went on to become so famous, because it was, in part, her unfamiliarity that made her understated performance as Celie so effective. (This may be the first and last time that the adjectiveunderstatedcan be applied to Goldberg.) Nominated for 11 Academy Awards, including best picture and actress (supporting players Oprah Winfrey and Margaret Avery were also nominated), it was quite a scandal--and a crushing blow to Spielberg--when it won none.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000Y11B8K", "6305428409", "B000BOH8X2", "0788815474", "B002VWNIBI", "B00AEFYG3S", "B00007L4KF", "B003BV8I3Q", "0156028352", "B00005AQML", "B002CA68NO", "B00066FAVW", "B00465I1CE", "6305212112", "B00066FAQW", "B004FK5EDY", "B003HKN534", "B00004TJKK", "B0009S4IGA", "B001NLJ3NU", "B00AEFY4CG", "0783230524", "B001P3SA94", "B00066FAC6", "B003Y5H4ZC", "B005CGI4O6", "B000B5XOSY", "B00AMSM9AO", "B00441GZ1Y", "B00CDWQNZ4", "B00G4Q3KOC", "B00BLN4V6E", "B00EV4EUT8", "B00AEFXTKO", "B0041QSZS8", "B004A8ZWVK", "0822003082", "B00BTYPWDQ", "B000765IJK", "B000P0J0CE", "6305505780", "B005LAIH1S", "0792846443", "B002M2Z3BA", "B003ASLJK4", "B0000560W6", "B0000714BT", "B00DW5IL2E", "B00003L9CK", "B00AEBB9FA", "B002NZK5VO", "B002VWNICM", "B00AEFXP8K", "B000059TFO", "B00000JGHV", "B00AEFY6TW", "B001K98MGE", "B002U4UZQI", "B000PE0GRI", "B000P0J0EW", "0783240171", "B0018RNF60", "B001JV5BF8", "B0006IIOHC", "B00005LC4D", "B00005JLQT", "B00HW3EI3I", "B00AEFYNG8", "0783231202", "B0000WN0NW", "6305236569", "B00005B8UA", "B00005KAQP", "B0009R1TJ0", "B002VECM4A", "B003LMPKSQ", "B0058KGHX6", "B00AEFXY6I", "B00BNV9WCW", "B000JLTRH2", "B001JV5BC6", "B0041H55S0", "B000P0J0EM", "B000069I0E", "B002CAWNEM", "B005ZMBEXU", "B00005RDAN", "0156031825", "1558908390", "B002CWKU36", "B003Y5H58S", "B000YIGNHW", "B000XA5JWG", "B000BQ7J8Y", "0790731533", "B0068FZ0W4", "B00081U7HC", "B00004Y2R1", "0151191549", "0792844874"], "bought_together": ["6305428409", "B000BOH8X2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0156028352", "B004A8ZWVK", "6305428409", "B000BOH8X2"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 55488}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 15.59, "brand": "", "asin": "0790729717", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51B6EPCQKZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Color Purple"}
{"description": "Martin Scorsese's 1990 masterpieceGoodFellasimmortalizes the hilarious, horrifying life of actual gangster Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), from his teen years on the streets of New York to his anonymous exile under the Witness Protection Program. The director's kinetic style is perfect for recounting Hill's ruthless rise to power in the 1950s as well as his drugged-out fall in the late 1970s; in fact, no one has ever rendered the mental dislocation of cocaine better than Scorsese. Scorsese uses period music perfectly, not just to summon a particular time but to set a precise mood.GoodFellasis at least as good asThe Godfatherwithout being in the least derivative of it. Joe Pesci's psycho improvisation of Mobster Tommy DeVito ignited Pesci as a star, Lorraine Bracco scores the performance of her life as the love of Hill's life, and every supporting role, from Paul Sorvino to Robert De Niro, is a miracle.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000C20VPA", "B000C20VRS", "B008R65XYC", "B000M341QE", "B0018CMJSU", "B0019L770A", "B0019L21GA", "B00004XPPB", "B000P0J0AG", "B0000DI87S", "B000P0J0EW", "B00003CXWV", "B00CCMKPO0", "B00G1C2URC", "B00004U103", "B00AEBB9NM", "B004SIP95G", "B002CPMB9O", "B0019L21H4", "B007TBIUSM", "B000286RP2", "B00011CZRE", "B004SIP8ZM", "B0006GAOJA", "B002T9H2LA", "B006TTC5HC", "B002VWNIEA", "0767830555", "B0000AMJEK", "B0000AM6JI", "B00005V9HH", "B004FQX5B6", "B000SFOW8I", "B00008975Z", "B002CA68N4", "6305313687", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00013RC2U", "0792174909", "B007D0FVRM", "B000A7DVR2", "B004G7XCRQ", "B002QEHPQU", "B003ASLJO0", "B000LP6KNU", "B000H5TH20", "B000P0J09C", "6305263248", "0783229526", "B00009W5CA", "B001C0I61M", "B000EHSVRI", "B00IEK9U0E", "B002ZG980U", "B004SIP7TE", "B004SIP7ZS", "B0006GAO5Y", "B00B0U2SFE", "B000ERVKBC", "B000A2UBN4", "B002AF4Y9G", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B0000714BS", "B000E5KQHI", "B00005JA8B", "B002O3Z4Y8", "B003AWRMCE", "B000P0J0EM", "1558908390", "B00080ZG10", "0767802519", "B003ELKNH2", "B003BV8I3Q", "B000035Z5G", "B00AEFXDO6", "B000E8NRBC", "B00000JGHV", "B00004RJ71", "B00AEBB9CS", "B004SIP93S", "B00AEFYSEA", "B004SIP6WW", "B003ASLJQS", "B0001Z4OXS", "B002VWNIDG", "0783225946", "B00AEBB9ZK", "B00AEFXXMI", "B0000A02TZ", "B000MZHW40", "B004SIP6GI", "B002ZG99N6", "B00AEBB95K", "B00AEFXP8K", "B00BB67UNW", "B00029RTAI", "B000P0J0D8", "B003ASLJOU", "B000Z8GZYW", "B003ASLJS6"], "bought_together": ["B000C20VPA", "B000C20VRS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000M341QE", "B0018CMJSU", "B000P0J0EW", "B00BCB1JJW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 120285}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.49, "brand": "WARNER STUDIOS", "asin": "0790729725", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41YHNBJW24L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "GoodFellas"}
{"description": "Director William Friedkin was a hot ticket in Hollywood after the success ofThe French Connection, and he turned heads (in more ways than one) when he decided to makeThe Exorcistas his follow-up film. Adapted by William Peter Blatty from hiscontroversial bestseller, this shocking 1973 thriller set an intense and often-copied milestone for screen terror with its unflinching depiction of a young girl (Linda Blair) who is possessed by an evil spirit. Jason Miller and Max von Sydow are perfectly cast as the priests who risk their sanity and their lives to administer the rites of demonic exorcism, and Ellen Burstyn plays Blair's mother, who can only stand by in horror as her daughter's body is wracked by satanic disfiguration. One of the most frightening films ever made,The Exorcistwas mysteriously plagued by troubles during production, and the years have not diminished its capacity to disturb even the most stoical viewers. The film is presented in letterbox format on digital video disc, with a soundtrack that's guaranteed to curdle your blood.

{"description": "Stanley Kubrick'sThe Shiningis less an adaptation of Stephen King's bestselling horror novel than a complete reimagining of it from the inside out. In King's book, the Overlook Hotel is a haunted place that takes possession of its off-season caretaker and provokes him to murderous rage against his wife and young son. Kubrick's movie is an existential Road Runner cartoon (his steadicam scurrying through the hotel's labyrinthine hallways), in which the cavernously empty spaces inside the Overlook mirror the emptiness in the soul of the blocked writer, who's settled in for a long winter's hibernation. As many have pointed out, King's protagonist goes mad, but Kubrick's Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) is Looney Tunes from the moment we meet him--all arching eyebrows and mischievous grin. (Both Nicholson and Shelley Duvall reach new levels of hysteria in their performances, driven to extremes by the director's fanatical demands for take after take after take.)The Shiningis terrifying--but not in the way fans of the novel might expect. When it was redone as a TV miniseries (reportedly because of King's dissatisfaction with the Kubrick film), the famous topiary-animal attack (which was deemed impossible to film in 1980) was there--but the deeper horror was lost. Kubrick'sThe Shininggets under your skin and chills your bones; it stays with you, inhabits you, haunts you. And there's no place to hide...--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300267881", "0790734079", "B00005ATQA", "6302038308", "6300182770", "B0009RRUKW", "0783235607", "0783228317", "B00000J2KZ", "B00004RNAC", "0790736039", "B00023NRSM", "6304508611", "6300182878", "6302921058", "6304509154", "0783216084", "6300214087", "B00004W5UA", "6301427076", "630268644X", "B000003KHS", "B000AMW2TK", "0790700506", "6300181340", "6300214753", "6302054982", "0784011923", "6305363668", "6303686796", "6305095566", "630021639X", "6302822688", "6305576173", "0783246641", "6304994540", "6303953425", "B00004U8PA", "0792158261", "0792100085", "6300213986", "6300189015", "630533577X", "6300214826", "0792846303", "6304288433", "6300147630", "0792842111", "B000007OY0", "0790741512", "6302158176", "0792846311", "6300183416", "0800103106", "B000005PFL", "6300183211", "0790733927", "6301666569", "6301871952", "0767825411", "630339406X", "6303109950", "6300216500", "6300214192", "6300262731", "6303257674", "6304214502", "630018627X", "6300214311", "1558807381", "0792839234", "0767819187", "B00005B238", "0790731975", "6303579388", "B000059HFB", "6302798450", "B00000FZCU", "6303651461", "6303566391", "6302642175", "6301971582", "6300218058", "6301094352", "6300184064", "6300181278", "6304457383", "6300214672", "6300262855", "0800125762", "6303257305"], "bought_together": ["0790734079"], "also_viewed": ["6300147630", "6300182878", "B00005ATQA", "6300189015", "6300267881", "B00023NRSM", "6300213005", "6303953425", "0307743659", "6303148352", "0790734079", "B001AQT0Z4", "6300183211", "0784011923", "B00BBND56G", "0788806270"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 268792}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.0, "brand": "", "asin": "0790705141", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5106FV0S4PL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Shining [VHS]"}
{"description": "It's enlightening to view Tim Burton'sMars Attacks!as his twisted satire of the blockbuster filmIndependence Day, which was released earlier the same year, although the movies were in production simultaneously. Burton's eye-popping, schlock tribute to 1950s UFO movies actually plays better on video than it did in theaters. The idea of invading aliens ray gunning the big-name movie stars in the cast is a cleverly subversive one, and the bulb-headed, funny-sounding animated Martians are pretty nifty, but it all seemed to be spread thin on the big screen. On video, however, the movie's kooky humor seems a bit more concentrated. The Earth actors (most of whom get zapped or kidnapped for alien science experiments) include Jack Nicholson, Glenn Close, Annette Bening, Pierce Brosnan, Danny DeVito, Martin Short, Sarah Jessica Parker, Rod Steiger, Michael&nbsp;J.

{"description": "You know exactly what you're getting inNational Lampoon's Christmas Vacation: another goofball, slapstick comedy of chaos and catastrophe with Clark Griswold (Chevy Chase) and family. This time, there's no traveling involved: Clark and Ellen (Beverly D'Angelo) prepare for a nice Christmas with the kids (played by none other than Juliette Lewis andRoseannestar Johnny Galecki), when their home is invaded by backwoods cousin Eddie (Randy Quaid) and his brood, along with assorted other crazy and/or stuffy relatives.

{"description": "One of the key movies of the 1970s, when exciting, groundbreaking, personal films were still being made in Hollywood, Milos Forman'sOne Flew over the Cuckoo's Nestemphasized the humanistic story at the heart of Ken Kesey's more hallucinogenic novel. Jack Nicholson was born to play the part of Randle Patrick McMurphy, the rebellious inmate of a psychiatric hospital who fights back against the authorities' cold attitudes of institutional superiority, as personified by Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher). It's the classic antiestablishment tale of one man asserting his individuality in the face of a repressive, conformist system--and it works on every level. Forman populates his film with memorably eccentric faces, and gets such freshly detailed and spontaneous work from his ensemble that the picture sometimes feels like a documentary. Unlike a lot of films pitched at the &quot;youth culture&quot; of the 1970s,One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nestreally hasn't dated a bit, because the qualities of human nature that Forman captures--playfulness, courage, inspiration, pride, stubbornness--are universal and timeless. The film swept the Academy Awards for 1976, winning in all the major categories (picture, director, actor, actress, screenplay) for the first time since Frank Capra'sIt Happened One Nightin 1931.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002VWNIDG", "B000RTB0R6", "B006TTC5HC", "B000FVQLQQ", "B000P0J0EW", "0767830555", "B0043X1FL8", "B00003CWQR", "B004SIP7ZS", "B003ELKNH2", "B0006GAOJA", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00AEFXN9G", "0767811100", "0792833287", "B004SIP95G", "B0000YEEGM", "B00079Z9VO", "0451163966", "B00AEFYSWM", "B000P0J09M", "B008MIMWP8", "B000EHQU0S", "B006FE83UE", "B000M341QE", "B00AEFXESQ", "B00002VWE0", "B004SIP8ZM", "B002VWNIAY", "B00009W5CA", "0764586629", "B000ZM1MGE", "B00011CZRE", "B000P0J09C", "B0008ENHUI", "B00005V9HH", "B0019L770A", "B0019L21GA", "B00AEBB9CS", "B0050FXDDQ", "B000CNESTE", "B0006GANN2", "B000LP6KNU", "B000P0J0EM", "B00000IQV7", "B000055Y0X", "B00001ZWUS", "079073219X", "B0019UGYK0", "079284646X", "B00AEBB9F0", "B003ASLJO0", "B000A7DVR2", "B00AEBB9FA", "B0002B15ZG", "B004U7MR3M", "B000YAF4MA", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00066FBQG", "B00005JKIS", "6305144168", "B004SIP7TE", "B002ZG980U", "B00005ATQB", "B0045HCJ94", "0783229526", "B000A3XY5A", "B000093FLA", "B00026ZD04", "B004L9GMBC", "B0000DI87S", "B00006RCO1", "B0007PALZ2", "B0000JBALO", "B004IFYMYI", "B007N31YH0", "B000P0J0D8", "B000H4JH7Q", "B00B0U2SFE", "0792846443", "B007D0FVRM", "B000022TSY", "B0087ZG7UW", "B0002234LS", "B0045HCJ9E", "B0000A02TZ", "B001GD6VTE", "B00AEFYRP0", "0784011710", "B00009AOAZ", "B00005JLSB", "B000Q678OO", "0792838408", "6305882592", "B003LMPKSQ", "B00005MEOU", "B00AEFYSL8", "B0057ZAA6W", "B001AEF6BI", "B000HC2LHG"], "bought_together": ["B002VWNIDG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000P0J0EW", "0451163966", "B006TTC5HC", "B00AEFY0F2"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 40218}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.24, "brand": "WARNER STUDIOS", "asin": "0790732181", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51pJoIlXFbL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"}

{"description": "Director Oliver Stone added 17 minutes of previously unseen footage for the &quot;director's cut&quot; edition of his hypnotic courtroom epic about the investigation into the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in November 1963. That fateful day in Dallas set in motion a sequence of events that would only intensify the mystery behind Kennedy's death, causing New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner) to begin an investigation that would gradually become a personal obsession. Bravura filmmaking combined with controversial treatment of historical facts and audacious speculation, this breathtaking revision of history presents a mesmerizing parade of shady figures and conspiracy theories, unfolding like a classic mystery based on history's greatest unsolved crime. A technical triumph boasting Oscar-winning cinematography and editing, Stone's film is guaranteed to grab the viewer's attention with its daring take on the JFK controversy.

{"description": "Winner of the Academy Award&reg; for best picture of 1989, this gracefully moving drama, adapted from the hit play by Alfred Uhry, chronicles the 25-year friendship between a stubborn, aging Southern widow (Jessica Tandy) and her loyal chauffeur (Morgan Freeman). At first, the self-sufficient Miss Daisy is reluctant to accept the services of a chauffeur, but Hoke is quiet, wise, and tolerant, and as the years pass the unlikely friends develop a deep mutual respect and admiration. Tandy deservedly won the Oscar for her sassy and sensitive performance, and Freeman earned an Oscar nomination for bringing quiet depth and integrity to his memorable role. Ironically, director Bruce Beresford (Tender Mercies) was not nominated, but the film won Oscars for makeup and for Uhry's screenplay, in addition to a supporting actor nomination for Dan Aykroyd as Daisy's supportive son. Delicate, funny, and bittersweet,Driving Miss Daisywas a surprise hit when released, and marked the crowning achievement of Tandy's great career.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305212112", "B0000JBALO", "B00004TJKK", "076780676X", "B00005NRN8", "B003ASLJK4", "B00AEBB9FA", "0783240171", "B00AEFY0F2", "B000P0J092", "B00001W9G0", "B004A8ZWVK", "B006FE83UE", "B000765IJK", "B004SIP7F8", "B001VC99HQ", "B00DDT0JB0", "B00AEFXYOA", "B000TXP56C", "B004SEUJOQ", "B000YAF4MA", "B004FQX5A2", "B001ECDVJU", "0767836359", "B003LMPKSQ", "B00AEFXD1O", "B002M2Z3BA", "B004AOECXI", "B00AEFY4CG", "6305128952", "0800141806", "B00004XPPC", "B00005MEOU", "B002NZK5RS", "B0045HCJ76", "B00006G8GZ", "B008B9JTFO", "B000JYW5B4", "B001ECDVK4", "6305236569", "6305428352", "B00AFEYJ80", "B000XJD34I", "6305133468", "B001NLJ3NU", "B00AEFYK5M", "B002VWNICM", "B00AATV07S", "B00020HAV0", "B007SPPANM", "B00020HAWE", "B000PHVZNE", "B002VECM6S", "B000065FJC", "B002VWNIAY", "B00011D1OU", "B00006RCO2", "B004SIP6C2", "B0010AN7Z4", "B000E6ESI0", "B0045HCJJY", "B0000YTP02", "6305213283", "B000EHRVOW", "6304907729", "B00K6D1QV8", "B00404ME1A", "B000JU8H9C", "B00EV4EUT8", "B000059HAN", "B00005AUKE", "B0009S4IKQ", "B005HWAOP2", "B007N31YH0", "B00AEFY9GW", "B000QQLVPQ", "B000KJTGHO", "B00AEBBACM", "630471193X", "B000244GCW", "B002HK9IDQ", "B000YDBPAM"], "bought_together": ["6305212112", "B0000JBALO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0000JBALO", "6305212112", "B00DDT0JB0", "B003ASLJK4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 77014}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 18.95, "brand": "", "asin": "0790730987", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4161YA15GNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Driving Miss Daisy"}
{"description": "Philip Kaufman's intimate epic about theMercuryastronauts (based on Tom Wolfe's book) was one of the most ambitious and spectacularly exciting movies of the 1980s.  It surprised almost everybody by not becoming a smash hit. By all rights, the film should have been every bit the success thatApollo 13would later become;The Right Stuffis not only just as thrilling, but it is also a bigger and better movie. Combining history (both established and revisionist), grand mythmaking (and myth puncturing), adventure, melodrama, behind-the-scenes dish, spectacular visuals, and a down-to-earth sense of humor,The Right Stuffchronicles NASA's efforts to put a man in orbit. Such an achievement would be the first step toward President Kennedy's goal of reaching the moon, and, perhaps most important of all, would win a crucial public relations/morale victory over the Soviets, who had delivered a stunning blow to American pride by launchingSputnik, the first satellite. The movie contrasts the daring feats of the unsung test pilots--one of whom, Chuck Yeager, embodied more than anyone else the skill and spirit of Wolfe's title--against the heavily publicized (and sanitized) accomplishments of theMercuryastronauts. Through no fault of their own, the spacemen became prisoners of the heroic images the government created for them in order to capture the public's imagination. The casting is inspired; the film features Sam Shepard as the legendary Yeager, Ed Harris as John Glenn, Dennis Quaid as &quot;Gordo&quot; Cooper, Scott Glenn as Alan Shepard, Fred Ward as Gus Grissom, Scott Wilson as Scott Crossfield, and Pamela Reed and Veronica Cartwright are superb in their thankless roles as astronauts' wives.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783225733", "B0006FYOTC", "B002O3Z4QQ", "B001BEK8CY", "B002NHX1YK", "B003AWRMBA", "0312427565", "B000XJ5TPE", "B00008K76U", "B00005J760", "B000CEXEWA", "B004L9GMBC", "B002GHHHKQ", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00004XPPC", "B001O4C6K8", "B0045HCJ9O", "B00BTYOYK8", "B000FTCLR6", "B0002V7OI8", "B00005JPLE", "0792838408", "0812992520", "B00080ETMM", "B000055Y0X", "B00AEFYBA6", "B000V7O0DU", "B004AOECXI", "B0015NORDW", "B000EHSVS2", "B00371QQ2U", "0767802470", "B00066FBQG", "B00A33J8YS", "B0006B2A42", "B00080ZG10", "B00319ECI8", "B00AEFXVOI", "B00008G8M4", "B007N31YH0", "B00AEFYENK", "B003ASLJRC", "B004FQX5A2", "B0000JBALO", "B000E1NXJ0", "B00004U2MS", "B000MNOX94", "B0026IQTR2", "B00003CWU3", "B00000G3PA", "B0026VBOJC", "B008JZRMQI", "B00003CXHJ", "0553256742", "B00008G8LY", "B00005T7HZ", "0743200799", "0553050931", "B000FZETR0", "B000EHSVSC", "B0000694Z3", "0783225547", "B0002WZTOI", "B002O3Z50G", "1439148813", "6305428514", "B0068FZ0GK", "B00003CXA6", "B0001NBMH6", "B00026L9CU", "B000YAF4MA", "B002GHHHPQ", "B0087ZG7HK", "B000KX0IOA", "B0001US66Y"], "bought_together": ["0783225733", "B0006FYOTC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0783225733", "B002ZNJXP8", "B003AWRMBA", "B0002WZTOI"]}, "price": 15.95, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 149633}, "asin": "0790731541", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516l1sshrEL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Right Stuff"}

Neo has always questioned his reality, but the truth is far beyond his imagination. Neo finds himself targeted by the police when he is contacted by Morpheus, a legendary computer hacker branded a terrorist by the government. Morpheus awakens Neo to the real world, a ravaged wasteland where most of humanity have been captured by a race of machines that live off of the humans' body heat and electrochemical energy and who imprison their minds within an artificial reality known as the Matrix. As a rebel against the machines, Neo must return to the Matrix and confront the agents: super-powerful computer programs devoted to snuffing out Neo and the entire human rebellion.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JLTM", "B0001DI5W6", "0784011923", "B001FB55HQ", "0792845684", "B001DZFYPW", "0790731975", "6300271331", "B00003CXE6", "0792839846", "0792133153", "6303257844", "6303313345", "6300182304", "6303168507", "B00000JGEK", "6304071876", "6300215830", "6301963725", "0800199421", "6303398480", "6305363668", "6303202004", "079213690X", "6304258984", "B0000509BZ", "6304434170", "630018627X", "6301976622", "0783222955", "6302610702", "6302787564", "0800132009", "0767825411", "6303020089", "6301574117", "6302909023", "B000003KHS"], "bought_together": ["B00005JLTM", "B0001DI5W6"], "also_viewed": ["B001DJLD1M", "B0054509I4", "B001CEE1YE", "B00005JKCH", "6303148352", "B000AYELVA", "B001GZ6QEC", "B001JNNDBA", "B0000AXE8I", "B0001DI5W6", "6303215734", "B00005JLTM", "B0007WFX62", "6304143184", "B00005N5S5", "B001AQT0Z4", "B001FB55HQ", "B0013FBS20", "B0001BKAEY", "B000PC6A3E", "B00007ELF1", "B00005JMQW", "B0000633U4", "1880521008", "B004XKVPG6", "B00ANGID14", "B001RIY4WE", "B008M4MB8K", "B00AEFY5B6", "B00B4804KS", "B00E5I2MCM", "B005LAIHY0", "B0013FSL3E", "B00471JSRE", "B0057R5XRG", "B00E9PMMX0", "B00C3MKCF6", "B00BEZTMFY", "B00AQNOCZ0", "B00IWULSTC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 579943}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.97, "brand": "", "asin": "0790745399", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51208Z0A3HL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Matrix"}

{"description": "Richard Gere works in a Chicago steel mill at the turn of the century, but must flee the city after accidentally killing a man. Heading for the wheat fields of Texas, he packs up his girlfriend (Brooke Adams) and his younger sister (Linda Manz). Instead of a better life, they head straight into tragedy when a wealthy farmer (Sam Shepard) falls for Adams. Believing him to be dying and expecting to inherit a fortune, she agrees to marry him. Their plans change when Shepard fails to die and Gere takes matters into his own hands. Aesthetically flawless, this film about a romantic love triangle is diminished by the small scope of video. Originally shown in 70mm, it is an eye-catching period piece that won its cinematographer, N&eacute;stor Almendros, a 1978 Oscar. Texture and color are the unbilled characters in this tragic tale, and are just as important as the players.

After a court sorceress hypnotizes Hawkins into believing he is also a legendary assassin, Hawkins has more identities than he can keep straight, and Kaye zips back and forth between them at, literally, a snap of the fingers. Comic highlights include a wonderful sword fight with Rathbone in which he constantly switches identities, and the classic \"chalice from the palace/vessel with pestle\" wordplay as Hawkins plays \"hide the poison\" and forgets where it is. With comely Glynis Johns as his spy-in-arms love interest, Angela Lansbury as the scheming princess, and Mildred Natwick as the dotty spellcaster, this is Danny Kaye at his comic best.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000AGWJ3", "B00AATV050", "B00EKGXA84", "B004G9C7RK", "B003UMW67K", "B004VUR68O", "B000ND91Z4", "B00GJT1ZPU", "B00007J5VS", "B00914ETQW", "B000BDH6B2", "B00GJNQ65U", "B0007939NO", "B0007O3902", "B00KGLS050", "B004A2Y8WA", "B00DJ5IPL4", "B000N3NNP8", "B008OBQGSC", "B00DJ5IQ1I", "B0090XLDKY", "B00KIZY3XW", "B002HK9IDQ", "B0009W5J6E", "B000KIX8VK", "B000Q66IT0", "B00LC4PBQQ", "B00BC0JGUW", "B00F3AE1FW", "B00K8CQ1Q2", "B00AEFYR9G", "1937878015", "B0042FUHV6", "B002MU4NN6", "B005NFJAZS", "B00009MEKJ", "B00JK322I6", "6305161984", "B000063K2R", "B0047CG9F2", "B0045HCJ9E", "B00AEBB97S", "B00C3ALLFS", "B00005JNA9", "B000059GEI", "B004P9UWM8", "0792845811", "B005R2SHIS", "B00074DY0W", "B00006FDAX", "B00CLF82KC", "B001AD8FXK", "B000K7VHNM", "B005ZVIP2Y", "B008LZMN24", "B00407PNWO", "B00GPWEPZ8", "B00005JL3W", "B003ASU2V6", "B006TTC5WC", "B00CA4S308", "B0007ZEOPK", "B00152VXUS", "B0002IOJCA", "B00DL48BM6", "B00006472U", "B00K6J7Q1Q", "B0007Z0OAO", "076781326X", "B00005UMFB", "B001BGS17Q", "B00008ZZ7B", "B00IJE1C1K", "B003BJODK0", "B00004TJQK", "B005GZ2CWS", "B000ATQYTC", "B00007J5VN", "B000JYW5B4", "B003B3NV4U", "B000KJU13C", "B001PPLINW", "B0045HCJHG", "B000RPCK2E", "B001O2UTRW", "B00005JKU7", "B00004XMV9", "B000ANVQ1E", "B00JJRLFTU", "B001GUYAZY", "B002Y26UJW", "B0001US8F8", "B007XTDWKQ", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B000G6BLWE", "B0030Y12AK", "B00E9ZATKI", "B000O599NK"], "bought_together": ["B00EKGXA84", "B0000AGWJ3"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00GJNQ65U", "B00EKGXA84", "B0000AGWJ3", "B00AATV050"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 55223}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 59.5, "brand": "KAYE,DANNY", "asin": "079215519X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/511C0SKTXML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Court Jester"}
{"description": "Martin Scorsese's brutal black-and-white biography of self-destructive boxer Jake LaMotta was chosen as the best film of the 1980s in a major critics' poll at the end of the decade, and it's a knockout piece of filmmaking. Robert De Niro plays LaMotta (famously putting on 50 pounds for the later scenes), a man tormented by demons he doesn't understand and prone to uncontrollably violent temper tantrums and fits of irrational jealousy. He marries a striking young blond (Cathy Moriarty), his sexual ideal, and then terrorizes her with never-ending accusations of infidelity. Jake is as frightening as he is pathetic, unable to control or comprehend the baser instincts that periodically, and without warning, turn him into the rampaging beast of the title. But as Roman Catholic Scorsese sees it, he works off his sins in the boxing ring, where his greatest athletic talent is his ability to withstand punishment. The fight scenes are astounding; they're like barbaric ritual dance numbers. Images smash into one another--a flashbulb, a spray of sweat, a fist, a geyser of blood--untilyoufeel dazed from the pummeling. Nominated for a handful of Academy Awards (including best picture and director),Raging Bullwon only two, for De Niro and for editor Thelma Schoonmacher.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["0767830555", "B000286RP2", "B006TTC5HC", "B000C20VPA", "B000P0J09M", "B0000DI87S", "B000A2UBN4", "B000CNESTE", "B004FQX5B6", "B00004XPPB", "B00AEFXN9G", "0792833287", "B00006RCNV", "B003ELKNH2", "B0050FXDDQ", "B0006GANN2", "B00003CXBU", "B0019L770A", "B00079Z9VO", "B000C20VRS", "B00AEBB9NM", "B000M341QE", "B004SIP7TE", "B000P0J0AG", "B00008975Z", "B0019L21GA", "B000WC39ZY", "079284646X", "B00AEBB95K", "B004SIP95G", "B0018CMJSU", "B002VWNIAY", "B00009W5CA", "6304907729", "B004SIP8ZM", "B000ARTN3I", "B00008RH3L", "B0000AM6JI", "B00005ATQB", "B000RTB0R6", "B003AWRMCE", "B00AEBB9CS", "B000286RR0", "B004L9GMBC", "6305263248", "B000LP6KNU", "B000P0J09C", "B0045HCJ8U", "B000P0J0EW", "B00080ZG10", "B00006ADD5", "B00004XPPC", "B00005V9HH", "B00003CWTI", "B002VWNIDG", "B003UESJHO", "B0006GAO5Y", "0792846109", "B00AEBB89C", "B002VWNICC", "B000063JDE", "B00005JKMQ", "B008R65XYC", "0767827902", "B000022TSY", "B002CPMB9O", "B00066FBQG", "B007STBUHI", "B0007DFJ0G", "B0001US62I", "B004U7MR14", "B00008O38F", "B000A7DVR2", "B001WLMOL4", "B000055Y0X", "B0087ZG7R0", "078324228X", "B0049985XW", "B003XURDAY", "B00GMT69C6", "B000063US2", "B00003CXWV", "B0045HCJTO", "B003ASLJQI", "B000CNESU8", "B000PAAJZ6", "B006FE83UE", "B00AEBB8NI", "B006TTC5MM", "0783225725", "0780618564", "B0019UGYK0", "B00001ZWUS", "6304698798", "6305941122", "B007Y1NR1W", "B003ZEQMH8", "6305918880", "B007TBIUSM", "B0087ZG7UW"], "bought_together": ["0767830555", "B006TTC5HC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00H9KKGTO", "B00008975Z", "B0018CMJSU", "B000C20VPA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 225981}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.7, "brand": "", "asin": "0792833236", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518QQEM9XPL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Raging Bull"}
{"description": "What a combo! Tobe Hooper, the director ofThe Texas Chainsaw Massacre, teamed up with family-oriented producer Steven Spielberg to makePoltergeist. The film is about a haunted suburban tract home in a development very much like the Arizona one in which Spielberg was raised. (Because it came out the same summer as Spielberg'sE.T., it was tempting to see both movies as representing Spielberg's ambivalent feelings about childhood in suburbia. One was a fantasy, the other a nightmare.)  Spielberg also cowrote the screenplay, which taps into primal, childlike fears of monsters under the bed, monsters in the closet, sinister clown faces, and all manner of things that go bump in the night. At first, some of the odd happenings in the house are kind of funny and amusing, but they grow gradually creepier until the film climaxes in a terrifying special-effects extravaganza when 5-year-old Carole Anne (Heather O'Rourke) is kidnapped by the spooks and held hostage in another dimension. Though not nearly as frightening as Hooper's magnum opus, or the originalA Nightmare on Elm Street, which came along two years later,Poltergeistis one of the smartest and most entertaining horror pictures of its time.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00009PY4G", "B00006FDCD", "B00AEFYYH6", "B007STBUHI", "B004SIP92O", "B00004BZIY", "B000VECAD0", "B00000IQC4", "B00005A8XX", "B004LWZW24", "B001B1872U", "B009XTF8KQ", "B00386EZUY", "B000HCO86I", "B00005JOJE", "B0087F7VSY", "B001D2WU9I", "B000PMLJMQ", "B000067FP8", "B000E1P2EY", "B003PIUINI", "B0009X763M", "B000WC3864", "B003UN0752", "B002I41KNC", "B0021L8UFI", "B005GT3X68", "B000P0J0A6", "B0087ZG7PW", "B00AIBZLVY", "B0045HCJJE", "B000ASATZ8", "B0000VCZK2", "B00EZ50SGW", "B00005JNTI", "B000E33W1W", "B00008LUNW", "B00AEBBA2W", "B000CCBC9O", "B0006SGYL0", "B000FAOC2W", "B00008WFU4", "B000OA8OK4", "B00005JNNT", "B001AGXEAG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00004TDTO", "B00004BZIY", "B000VECAD0", "B00006FDCD"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 69740}, "asin": "0792833201", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31ZsC3YTJ5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Poltergeist"}
{"description": "When it was released during Hollywood's golden year of 1939,The Wizard of Ozdidn't start out as the perennial classic it has since become. The film did respectable business, but it wasn't until its debut on television that this family favorite saw its popularity soar. And whileOz's TV broadcasts are now controlled by media mogul Ted Turner (who owns the rights), the advent of home video has made this lively musical a mainstay in the staple diet of great American films. Young Dorothy Gale (Judy Garland), her dog, Toto, and her three companions on the Yellow Brick Road to Oz--the Tin Man (Jack Haley), the Cowardly Lion (Bert Lahr), and the Scarecrow (Ray Bolger)--have become pop-culture icons and central figures in the legacy of fantasy for children. As the Wicked Witch who covets Dorothy's enchanted ruby slippers, Margaret Hamilton has had the singular honor of scaring the wits out of children for more than six decades. The film's still as fresh, frightening, and funny as it was when first released. It may take some liberal detours from the original story by L. Frank Baum, but it's loyal to the Baum legacy while charting its own course as a spectacular film. Shot in glorious Technicolor, befitting its dynamic production design (Munchkinland alone is a psychedelic explosion of color and d&eacute;cor),The Wizard of Ozmay not appeal to every taste as the years go by, but it's required viewing for kids of all ages.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B005F96UJ6", "B0000VCZKM", "B00E9ZATKI", "0792839749", "B0087F7VSY", "B0090XLDKY", "B002M2Z3BA", "076781326X", "B00C7JGDBW", "B000P0J09W", "B000URDCC6", "B002HK9IDQ", "B0000DZ3EN", "B000RPCK2E", "B000065V42", "B001JV5BF8", "B0000AM6IY", "B00335EQ0E", "B005NFJAZS", "B003VS0CX8", "B0000VCZKW", "0062278010", "B002NZK5SW", "B0010X744G", "B00CQRN3QI", "B0009XT8ME", "B000HT3PGU", "B006VJ1AAI", "B00005RRG7", "B008H6GHEM", "B00GVFJ5QS", "B00HVBB140", "B002VWNIAY", "B000BT970O", "B002CLBJPK", "0060293233", "B00028HBES", "B00322XV8Q", "B00EV1YZ96", "B000AJJNIG", "B00AATV0WS", "B0054OGQM8", "1495421864", "0739060821", "B00AEFXMGU", "0792833759", "B00AMSQBNK", "B000TPTCP0", "B0009X75QU", "B00ITVMMOY", "B00005RRGB", "B0017Q0SJ4", "0767836324", "B004302N2Q", "084318017X", "B001GLX6UI", "B003YBW2Y4", "1402766254", "B00019GHU2", "B00003CXCQ", "B00AMSM9CW", "B00005JG6M", "B0047QLNUY", "B00GDT5T9Y", "B00447L4JG", "0767819659", "B00000JPH6", "B002BIGCXS", "B00G5G7EXY", "B0000AK7AB", "B006FE83UE", "B002VWNIBI", "B00005JL1P", "B001ILFUDC", "0800177258", "B000QQLVPQ", "B00005RDSQ", "B00JHH1ZN8", "B0006IINYQ", "B0015NORDW", "B002GHHHNS", "B0013ND30M", "0792838408", "B001AGXEAG", "B0047CG9F2", "B00006ADD5", "B0013FSL3E", "B00079Z9VO", "B00F6SHECS", "B0008JIJ2E", "B00CTNYLQA", "B00005JN4W"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00HVBB140", "B005F96UJ6", "B0000VCZKM", "B00I6JOD2S"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 206236}, "asin": "0792833171", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GYW80GAJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Wizard of Oz"}
{"description": "Well, bless my beautiful hide! Director Stanley Donen invests this rollicking musical with a hearty exuberance. Howard Keel, with his big-as-all-outdoors baritone, stars as a bold \"mountain man\" living in the Oregon woods who brings home a bride (plucky songbird soprano Jane Powell) to his six slovenly brothers. Taming the rambunctious brood, Jane proceeds to make gentlemen of them so they can woo sweethearts of their own. But old habits die hard: their flirting gives way to fighting in the film's celebrated barn-raising scene, a lively acrobatic dance number exuberantly choreographed by Michael Kidd. Big brother chimes in with his own brand of advice--an old-fashioned kidnapping! Donen manages to get away with such a politically incorrect plot by investing the boys with a innocent sweetness, most notably the youngest brother played with genial earnestness by Rusty (Russ) Tamblyn (pre-West Side Story). This modest production became a huge hit and remains one of MGM's best-loved musical comedies, an energetic, high-kicking classic.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00000F6D1", "630233683X", "6304178352", "6305282927", "6303444202", "6304151306", "B00004TZS4", "0790744759", "0792837533", "6303494390", "6302363268", "0792837614", "6304400551", "6304117752", "6300246787", "6301390725", "0792837630", "6303854311", "6300275310", "B00000I1EM", "6300269566", "B00004TRD5", "0792840844", "0792837649", "6301976932", "B0002B15Y2", "6300216195", "6304331851", "B0074JOUHE", "0792837096", "0790741091", "6301586026", "B0000040EO", "6300215717", "B000006GTO", "6304005490", "6300182118", "6302136261", "6300215598", "0800100832", "6302363292", "6303929966", "6300184889", "6302241103", "0783235593"], "bought_together": ["B00000F6D1", "630233683X"], "also_viewed": ["B001PO550A", "B00004TZS4", "B000HT3PGU", "6301976932", "B0007Z0O9U", "6303215734", "0783235593", "B0000040EO", "6304178352", "6305282927", "0792837614", "6304151306", "0792837533", "6300215695", "0792837630", "630233683X", "6303494390", "B00EQIYZTO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 331822}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.95, "brand": "", "asin": "0792837592", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51G22RBC2ML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Seven Brides for Seven Brothers [VHS]"}

It retains a quaint charm while some of the songs--including the title tune--are quite hummable. A huge plus is Dick Van Dyke, who is extremely appealing as an eccentric inventor around the turn of the century. With nimble fingers and a unique way of looking at the world, he invents for his children a magic car that floats and flies. Or does he? The special effects are tame by today's standards, and the film is about 20 minutes too long--but its enthusiasm charms.

{"description": "The first feature film to be photographed and projected in the panoramic three-camera Cinerama process, this epic Western is almost as expansive as the West itself, chronicling a pioneering family's triumphs and tragedies in numerous episodes spanning three generations and a half century of westward movement. Divided into five segments directed by veteran Hollywood filmmakers Henry Hathaway, George Marshall, and the legendary John Ford (and including uncredited sequences directed by Richard Thorpe), the film was one of the most ambitious ever made by the venerable MGM studio. Its stellar cast reads like a virtual who's who of Hollywood's biggest stars. Debbie Reynolds plays a sturdy survivor of many pioneering dangers, and the eventual widow of a gambler (Gregory Peck), who is later reunited with her nephew (George Peppard), a Civil War veteran and cavalryman who heads for San Francisco as the transcontinental railroad is being built. Many more characters and stories are woven throughout this epic film, which is dramatically uneven but totally engrossing with its stunning vistas and countless outdoor locations in Illinois, Kentucky, South Dakota, Monument Valley in Arizona, California, Colorado, and elsewhere.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00008CMT3", "B000056H2H", "B00E3QJ8DC", "B006VRRGOO", "B00AEFXUL2", "6304696612", "B00009AVA5", "B000O599Y4", "B00BXTDVEO", "B000O59A0C", "B00AEFYL6K", "B000O599ZS", "B0082LUFA4", "0783228031", "B000O77LY2", "B000O599NK", "078322592X", "B00393SG0G", "B0045HCJSK", "B000ANVPP6", "B000OT6V0U", "B00BGQ2P9G", "B00008CMR6", "B000FTCLQC", "B000O599YE", "B00008MTW5", "B0009ML2KQ", "B00AEFYPHA", "B00AEBB8YM", "B00AEBB932", "B000O599YY", "B005GZ2CWS", "B00008MTW6", "B000ANVPPQ", "B009YX8MSG", "B000G6N0HI", "B007Y1NR1W", "B000BT96DW", "B00J9BZ4KC", "B00BAXTY7G", "B00004TJQK", "B00004ZBVE", "B00AMDA2OY", "B00004XMV9", "B000O599NA", "B00E4DJK78", "B00BFWKE62", "B0007US7FI", "B000O599WQ", "0783230478", "B000O599VM", "B000059TFU", "B000NQRR34", "B00AEFYBA6", "B0009ML2JC", "B00008MTW7", "B00AEFY6ZQ", "B00C3ALLPS", "B000056H2E", "B000QRI1GW", "B000031EGW", "B000O599ZI", "B00IU6HPIQ", "B000N3T0GY", "B000O599YO", "B003ASLJRC", "B003NF97MQ", "B00FNR9YY8", "B00005PJ8S", "0792838408", "B0001Z3I0I", "B00A92MCNW", "B0007PALM0", "B00AEFXSVE", "B005AMJ38S", "B000BPL2FG", "B009INAI02", "B0014BJ1A4", "B00CFHEE08", "B00005ASGH", "B0007MANZI", "B001B187NO", "B00132D7Y0", "B004GSVX8A", "B0007MANYY", "B004DY1VIO", "B0009X75WE", "B001D7T6BI"], "bought_together": ["B00008CMT3", "B000056H2H"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00BXTDVEO", "B00J9BZ4KC", "B000056H2H", "B00IU6HPIQ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 315351}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 30.49, "brand": "", "asin": "0792839072", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61HH9Y5XTJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "How the West Was Won"}
{"description": "Based on Thomas Harris's novel, this terrifying film by Jonathan Demme really only contains a couple of genuinely shocking moments (one involving an autopsy, the other a prison break). The rest of the film is a splatter-free visual and psychological descent into the hell of madness, redeemed astonishingly by an unlikely connection between a monster and a haunted young woman. Anthony Hopkins is extraordinary as the cannibalistic psychiatrist Dr. Hannibal Lecter, virtually entombed in a subterranean prison for the criminally insane. At the behest of the FBI, agent-in-training Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) approaches Lecter, requesting his insights into the identity and methods of a serial killer named Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine). In exchange, Lecter demands the right to penetrate Starling's most painful memories, creating a bizarre but palpable intimacy that liberates them both under separate but equally horrific circumstances. Demme, a filmmaker with a uniquely populist vision (Melvin and Howard,Something Wild), also spent his early years making pulp for Roger Corman (Caged Heat), and he hasn't forgotten the significance of tone, atmosphere, and the unsettling nature of a crudely effective close-up. Much of the film, in fact, consists of actors staring straight into the camera (usually from Clarice's point of view), making every bridge between one set of eyes to another seem terribly dangerous.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005LKIM", "6302054982", "B00008AOS5", "B00005PJ8I", "B000007OY0", "6302800420", "0790705141", "B00003CXE6", "6301179552", "6301427076", "B000003KHS", "6300989003", "6303402348", "B0000633ZP", "B00005ATQA"], "bought_together": ["6302054982"], "also_viewed": ["6305363668", "6302415853", "0792116887", "079213690X", "0800103106", "6305750750"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 331980}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.0, "brand": "", "asin": "0792842111", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4117Q86BS0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Silence of the Lambs [VHS]"}

{"description": "Francis Ford Coppola returns to Stoker's novel for this umpteenth take of the Transylvanian bloodsucker. Gary Oldman plays the vampire, Dracula, doomed to be a creature of the night after forsaking God but aroused by the image of a British woman (Winona Ryder) who resembles his own lost love. Oldman does well by the monster, even if he doesn't register much personality in the process, and Anthony Hopkins is a little overachieving as the vampire killer Van Helsing. The rest of the cast is serviceable, except Keanu Reeves, who--not atypically--is wooden and somehow empty. Coppola seems to approach the film as chunks of experimental opportunity, some of which work out all right while others are mannered or even foolish. What is undeniable is the tremendous buzz of the film's energy, particularly in a fantastic middle sequence that plays like a psychedelic nightmare.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000059XXZ", "0767819187"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 628165}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.95, "brand": "", "asin": "0800137884", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/512X6W16VZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Bram Stoker's Dracula (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]"}

In addition to being saddled with a devoted-but-nerdy best friend, Matt (Sean Marquette), she falls victim to one of the dangers of playing Seven Minutes in Heaven with the coolest kids in school: being stranded without a willing make-out partner. Humiliated, Jenna buries herself in the aforementioned make-out closet, wishing she could skip the whole adolescence bit and move straight into adulthood, and miraculously wakes up just weeks away from her 30th birthday. Of course, a lot has changed since going to bed the night before, not the least of which being an impressive set of womanly curves. The new, older Jenna (Jennifer Garner) is a successful magazine editor with friends in high places and a lion's share of potential suitors -- including a hockey-playing boyfriend and a swarthy married man. The problem is that her mind hasn't matured with her body; Jenna not only finds living on her own more terrifying than cool, but is quick to dismiss any male over the age of 14 as \"gross.\" Half excited, half mortified, Jenna seeks out Matt (Mark Ruffalo), whom she learns she had spurned as a teenager in an effort to join the popular crowd.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00006ZXSL", "B00AKGG6JS", "B00005O5CM", "B00AEFXO8Q", "B0015I2RT8", "B001OQCUYI", "B00005JMCW", "B001OQCUZM", "B00003CXSM", "B000J103OI", "B00AEFYM2S", "B002K0WBXW", "B00AEBB8R4", "B000EMGICS", "B004SIP9X8", "B003LSFM6U", "B0000897EG", "B000ELJAEM", "B00AEFY99O", "1401324142", "6304765266", "1416205152", "B00GO37I8Y", "0809229374", "B0001XAR1I", "B0001Z3TXE", "B00005JM55", "B00AEFYWQY", "B00007E2F5", "B0002VYOVI", "B00KS9V6EC", "B000J4QW7W", "B000YDBPAM", "B0007PLLBU", "B001TUZD8O", "B002ZG988M", "B0009OL7Z4", "B004SIP9RO", "B0000ZMGWK", "1400050138", "B0000DZ6N3", "B00AQS803A", "6302077818", "B00006ZXSK", "B00005JN0Z", "B000YAA68C", "B0007LXPBI", "B00E4Z7FQY", "B002P413IC", "B001ASQ9OM", "B006YTGL86", "B00795C5X4", "B00063KGPU", "B000BVM1S2", "B000209KMW", "B000A343RI", "B00062IVN0", "B000P0J0DS", "B00002SSKI", "6305428425", "B003TY2SWC", "B0051GLDVS", "B00008K7AM", "B0071HPOGK", "B0000AKCJK", "B000023VTP", "B00AEBB8YW", "B00006FMUW", "B002XTXG8O", "B00AMEZDJW", "B001AEF6BS", "B00447L4KA", "B000MQC9H4", "6305428042", "B002GOAH1U", "B0036TGSIK", "B002A5EBMQ", "B0000AOV4I", "B001C5LLQ4", "B000324Y98", "B00005JG6N", "6305236569", "B00AEFZ6V4", "B004EPZ070", "B003L20ICE", "B0038N9X3Q", "B00AEBBA2M", "B00005JN3W", "B0075RREYG", "B000F2BNW2", "0783235070", "B0021L8UO4", "0800177258", "B002SYAGNC", "B000HT386M", "B0007P0Y7C", "B000QUU4LY", "B00006ZXSN", "B00AEBB9WI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0013D8LFY", "B002K0WBXW", "B00AKGG6JS", "B001OQCUZM"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 461629}, "asin": "1404918051", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41EO6%2BQ3jvL.jpg", "title": "13 Going on 30: Fun &amp; Flirty Edition"}

{"description": "Considered by many to be the greatest B&nbsp;movie ever made, the original-release version of Orson Welles's film noir masterpieceTouch of Evilwas, ironically, never intended as a B&nbsp;movie at all--it merely suffered that fate after it was taken away from writer-director Welles, then reedited and released in 1958 as the second half of a double feature. Time and critical acclaim would eventually elevate the film to classic status (and Welles's original vision was meticulously followed for the film's 1998 restoration), but for four decades this original version stood as a testament to Welles's directorial genius. From its astonishing, miraculously choreographed opening shot (lasting over three minutes) to Marlene Dietrich's classic final line of dialogue, this sordid tale of murder and police corruption is like a valentine for the cinematic medium, with Welles as its love-struck suitor. As the corpulent cop who may be involved in a border-town murder, Welles faces opposition from a narcotics officer (Charlton Heston) whose wife (Janet Leigh) is abducted and held as the pawn in a struggle between Heston's quest for truth and Welles's control of carefully hidden secrets. The twisting plot is wildly entertaining (even though it's harder to follow in this original version), but even greater pleasure is found in the pulpy dialogue and the sheer exuberance of the dazzling directorial style.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302281849", "B001BZQMFA", "0783236352", "1558807780", "0783221347", "0782008348", "630266232X", "630347327X", "6305012792", "6302655897", "6302413400", "6302413435"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 403157}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.88, "brand": "", "asin": "1558804226", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51G3Y343C4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Touch of Evil [VHS]"}
{"description": "This strange, 1985 experiment by Ridley Scott (Blade Runner) starred the up-and-coming Tom Cruise in a fairy-tale world of dwarfs and unicorns and demons. After the horn of a unicorn is broken, darkness and winter descend upon the world. Cruise's character, helped along by a magic sprite played by David Bennent (The Tin Drum), descends into hell to save paradise. This movie is almost a classic case of art direction gone amok. The somewhat amorphous Cruise doesn't lend much dramatic focus or artistic definition, but the drama between Tim Curry's satanic majesty and Mia Sara's character, who becomes a sort of princess of the netherworld, is pretty captivating. A mixed experience all around that makes one wish it had been more successful.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00000JPH5", "6303212395", "B00000JPH4", "6300248100", "6303257674", "B00005OLY5", "6304509154", "079073463X", "0790700506", "630196649X", "6300214087", "0792845684", "6300182878", "0790705141", "6304994540", "6302182522", "0800135954"], "bought_together": ["B00000JPH5"], "also_viewed": ["B0000014XE", "B0000687KA", "B00IJUIY60"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 237584}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 10.99, "brand": "", "asin": "1558807381", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31HNRKDKT8L.gif", "title": "Legend [VHS]"}
{"description": "Judge Dreddis one of those movies that doesn't have a brain of its own, so it can only rip off a lot of ingredients from other, better movies. It's a mishmash ofBlade Runner,Total Recall, andThe Road Warrior, with a dash ofStar Warstossed in for good measure. As if that weren't enough, it's got Sylvester Stallone, who seems to be the only one in the movie who's in on the game and knows it's all a sci-fi scam. LikeThe Fifth Elementa few years later,Judge Dredddepicts a futuristic megalopolis packed with crowded vertical overgrowth and rampant commerce, where anarchy reigns supreme. Violent \"block wars\" are fought by lawless citizens with machine guns, and Judge Dredd (Stallone) is one of the city's heavily armed policemen, given free rein to judge and execute the perpetrators of violence. But Dredd himself is subjected to judgment and swift justice when his own gun is identified in the murder of a prominent TV reporter, forcing him to do whatever he can to clear his name. Diane Lane plays his partner in crime-fighting and romance, and Rob Schneider provides juvenile comic relief as Dredd's streetwise sidekick.

{"description": "Art-movie goddess Delphine Seyrig (Last Year at Marienbad) slinks through the plush Eurotrash settings as the deathless Elizabeth Bathory, Vampire Countess, in Harry K&uuml;mel's minor Dutch classic of lesbian erotic-gothic. Blood mingles with water during the languorous shower scenes. Set at an upper-crust seaside resort, the 1971 film recounts Bathory's plot to replace her current consort (Andrea Rau) with a fresher specimen, an abused newlywed whose brutal young husband is an inconvenience waiting to be eliminated. Although both the bi-sex and the neck-biting violence are tame by today's standards, the film has a graceful, gliding sense of pace that gets under your skin; something unspeakably kinky always seems to be just about to happen.

Outgunning such contemporaries asLittle CaesarandThe Public Enemy--in terms of both its ferocious death-dealing and dynamic style--the movie was interfered with by censors and kept out of circulation for decades thanks to its eccentric producer, Howard Hughes. It remains the gold standard among classic gangster pictures. Paul Muni's portrayal of Al Capone surrogate Tony Camonte etched a screen original: a merciless assassin who's not only reflexively criminal but pre-civilized, almost pre-evolutionary, a simian shadow ready to rub out the world if he can't have it for his own. This is still one of the greatest, darkest, most deeply exciting films American cinema has produced.

{"description": "Peter Bogdanovich directed this sensitive and moving story about a teenage boy, Rocky (Eric Stoltz), who lives with severe facial deformities and poor prognosis for survival beyond childhood. The film concentrates on that threshold-of-adulthood period familiar to past and present 16-year-olds, folding together common experiences of youth (love, hassles with mom, a desire to travel) with the special burdens endured by the hero. Stoltz, absolutely unrecognizable under lots and lots of prosthetic makeup, is quite good, as are Cher (as Rocky's mother) and Sam Elliott (Rocky's father figure).

{"description": "As bad asFriday the 13th, Part 2is, it's a work of art in comparison to the rest of theFriday the 13thflicks that came afterward. This installment officially introduced us to Jason Voorhees as the killer (if you remember Drew Barrymore's fatal phone quiz inScream, you know that the killer in the firstFriday the 13thwas actually Jason's mother), and made the slicing and dicing even more generic. Survivor Alice is dispatched within the first 10 minutes, and we're left with plucky Ginny (Amy Steel, doing a fairly decent Jamie Lee Curtis impression) to do battle with the monstrous Jason. Ginny's part of a another group of horny teenagers (less intelligent as well as less attractive than their predecessors) who try to resurrect Camp Crystal Lake five years after the initial murders--a pretty mean feat, considering this movie was made only a year after the first one. Being a smarty-pants child-psychology major, Ginny tries to outwit the dim Jason, and at one point dons the bloody and moldy sweater of Jason's late mother (which is more disgusting than any of the killings beforehand) in an attempt to confuse the masked killer. Jason may not be the brightest bulb on the tree, but the only one who's going to pull the wool--or in this case, the burlap--over his eyes is Jason himself, who wears a sack with one eyehole throughout the movie to hide his deformed features (he finally found his way to a sporting-goods store and his trademark hockey mask appears in the third installment of the series).

{"description": "This 1985 adventure directed by Barry Levinson (Rain Man) and written  by Chris Columbus (Gremlins) may not have much to do with the Sherlock  Holmes of Arthur Conan Doyle's invention. But it is a delightful and somewhat  unexpected combination of exciting elements: Victorian-era, foggy-London  mystique, Gothic horror, and Indiana Jones-like exotica. Nicholas Rowe plays  Holmes as a schoolboy at a boarding academy for young men. Paired with the  owlish, reticent young Watson (Alan Cox), Holmes embarks on the solution of a  mystery that involves a hallucinatory and lethal drug, and a religious cult celebrating ancient Egyptian rites of mummification. Levinson makes handsome  and crisp work of this Steven Spielberg production, without a trace of the  treacle that often found its way into other Spielbergian projects at the time  (The Goonies). Rowe is wonderfully  convincing as a teen incarnation of the Great Detective, and while Cox mostly  maintains Hollywood's traditionally unflattering idea of Watson, he does  bring warmth and comedy to the role. The cast includes Freddie Jones as an  eccentric inventor, Anthony Higgins as the villain, and Sophie Ward as  Holmes's love interest.--Tom Keogh", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 536183}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.74, "brand": "", "asin": "6300214508", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51NPVMVW7WL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Young Sherlock Holmes [VHS]"}

{"description": "This minor 1955 work by Alfred Hitchcock, one of the lighter entries of his creative peak in the 1950s, is still imbued with the master's stock themes of shared guilt and romantic ambivalence. It is also hardly lacking in Hitchcockian cinematic inventiveness, such as a famous, often-imitated sequence in which some smooching between stars Cary Grant and Grace Kelly is intercut with a fireworks show that just happens to be going on outside in a Riviera setting. Grant plays a reformed cat burglar who is suspected of reviving his trade, though he knows someone else is using his old methods. A very enjoyable experience, but don't get this confused with Hitchcock's other Cary Grant film of that decade, which was a masterpiece:North by Northwest.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["0790743213", "6300183513", "0783221347", "0783235593", "B0000040EO", "6304039530", "6300181529", "6302227127", "6300215717", "079284517X", "6305123616", "0782006779", "6301798503", "0792839846", "6304457383", "6300183580", "630233683X", "0782006809", "0780614097", "6302484448", "6300215628", "6301670140", "0793910323", "6301586026", "630299005X", "6302413435", "6303102441", "6301670159", "0783235607", "6300215733", "0792837649", "6300181472", "630266232X", "6304117752", "0783235615", "6300215512", "6304383827", "6300158438", "B000059HH1", "0800100832", "6300215644", "0782008348", "6300215962", "6300216500", "0792837614", "B00004TRD5", "B000056BRF", "B000055Y0Y", "B00005ALP2", "6305718792", "6301964012", "6302363268", "B0045HCJ9E", "6300214028", "6304359705", "0792107683", "0783236352", "6304259131", "6302636779", "1558807780", "B000006N70", "6301734734", "B00004RFFA", "6301978315", "6301647734", "630018157X", "B00000I1EM", "6302909023", "6300215660", "6300213676", "6303631851", "B000EO7AIC", "6303082866", "630442972X", "6300181405", "6302700949", "0792845684", "6300215814", "6303364772", "B000021Y6K", "6302800897", "B00004RV8M", "6302800420", "6300214699", "6300216721", "6301797957", "6301965701", "6305122725", "0783226152", "B000BWIZRW", "0790733935", "6305012792", "6303908306", "6302098424", "6301045750", "6302278929", "6303192254", "6303562248", "6302736951"], "bought_together": ["0790743213", "6300183513"], "also_viewed": ["6304117752"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 239511}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.98, "brand": "", "asin": "6300215741", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51C7XND430L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "To Catch a Thief [VHS]"}

{"description": "One reviewer wrote: The late Margaux Hemingway saw her movie career take a nosedive after the release of this film, while her co-star and little sister Mariel became the toast of the town. But to many cinephiles, she'll always be remembered as the woman in red holding one mean rifle. Margaux plays Chris McCormick, a top fashion model (no stretch at all, here, since she really was a top model at the time) who ends up regretting her decision of having innocently invited her sibling's music teacher (Chris Sarandon of \"Fright Night\" fame) to her apartment. While she cries rape (with the help of Academy award winner Anne Bancroft as her attorney) the judicial system, however, sees it differently. LIPSTICK is the ultimate B-movie extravaganza. Raw to the bone, it is avant-garde cinema with a glossy exterior. David Rayfeil's script spares no details in degrading women via ultra-violent scenes (one a la \"The Accused\") and a misogynistic message regarding men and feminine beauty. But as a whole--and not too taken seriously--LIPSTICK is 90 minutes of pure fun. The film has a Russ Myer feel to it, a sort of cinema verite of the late 60's (the ones who lured mostly the male clientele). Margaux Hemingway gives all she's got and comes up almost rosy despite her limited range. She may not be Meryl Streep, but, contrary to popular opinion, her performance is believable. Of course, then-12 year old Mariel do steal the show with her quiet but strong delivery. Every nuance of her emotional face shows the making of a great actress, and she did become one for awhile, while her older sister stumbled and stumbled in forgettable Z flicks. LIPSTICK was indeed the apogee of Margaux's career. Far from being Academy award worthy, it is definitely a fave among lovers of cult movies, and with good reasons.", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 430019}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 20.86, "brand": "", "asin": "6300216861", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DSAG6DXZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Lipstick [VHS]"}
{"description": "Back when the  firstStar Trekfeature was released in December 1979, theTrekfranchise was still relatively modest, consisting of the original TV series, an animated cartoon series from 1973-74, and a burgeoning fan network around the world. Series creator Gene Roddenberry had conceived a second TV series, but after the success ofStar Warsthe project was upgraded into this lavish feature film, which reunited the original series cast aboard a beautifully redesigned starship U.S.S.Enterprise. Under the direction of Robert Wise (best known forWest Side Story), the film proved to be a mixed blessing forTrekfans, who heatedly debated its merits; but it was, of course, a phenomenal hit. Capt. Kirk (William Shatner) leads his crew into the vast structures surrounding V'Ger, an all-powerful being that is cutting a destructive course through Starfleet space. With his new First Officer (Stephen Collins), the bald and beautiful Lieutenant Ilia (played by the late Persis Khambatta) and his returning veteran crew, Kirk must decipher the secret of V'Ger's true purpose and restore the safety of the galaxy. The story is rather overblown and derivative of plots from the original series, and avid Trekkies greeted the film's bland costumes with derisive laughter. But as a feast for the eyes, this is an adventure worthy of big-screen trekkin'. Douglas Trumbull's visual effects are astonishing, and Jerry Goldmith's score is regarded as one of the prolific composer's very best (with its main theme later used forStar Trek: The Next Generation). And, fortunately forStar Trekfans, the expanded 143-minute version (originally shown for the film's network TV premiere) is generally considered an improvement over the original theatrical release.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300214400", "6300213803", "6301543408", "6303202004", "630021463X", "6303909949", "B0000AUHOH", "B00008OSD3", "6301792734", "6305587159", "6300182304", "B0000A36J1", "B000065U6Q", "6304415346", "6305365121", "630336568X", "0671830880", "6300214060", "6304935811", "6302380588", "6303651488"], "bought_together": ["6300213803", "6300214400"], "also_viewed": ["6300213803", "6301543408", "B00DB97LRC", "6300214400", "630021463X", "B00BAXTYIA", "B00005JLRT", "6303202004", "B00DB97LCM", "B00000ILBK", "B002I9Z8DK", "B0000AUHOH", "B002I9Z8B2", "6304415346", "6304539258", "B000USUA8Y", "B002I9Z8CG", "B0095XPZBC", "B002I9Z8GW", "B001TH16DI", "B0083TUEHY", "B00HETWFVC", "630273486X", "B000HEWEJ4", "6303909949", "6300213668"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 278050}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.79, "brand": "", "asin": "6300216802", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4164CYFHC6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Star Trek - The Motion Picture [VHS]"}

{"description": "The prestigious filmmaking trio of producer Ismail Merchant, director James Ivory, and screenwriter Ruth Prawer Jhabvala had made other critically acclaimed films beforeA Room with a Viewwas released in 1985, but it was this popular film that made them art-house superstars. Splendidly adapted from the novel by E.M. Forster, it's a comedy of the heart, a passionate romance and a study of repression within the British class system of manners and mores. It's that system of rigid behavior that prevents young Lucy Honeychurch (Helena Bonham Carter) from accepting the loving advances of a free-spirited suitor (Julian Sands), who fears that she will follow through with her engagement to a priggish intellectual (Daniel Day-Lewis) whose capacity for passion is virtually nonexistent. During and after a trip to Italy with her protective companion (Maggie Smith), Lucy gradually gets in touch with her true emotions. The fun of watchingA Room with a Viewcomes from seeing how Lucy's thoughts and feelings finally arrive at the same romantic conclusion. Through an abundance of humor both subtle and overt, this crowd-pleasing \"art movie\" rose to an unexpected level of popular appeal. The Merchant-Ivory team received eight Academy Award nominations for their efforts, and won the Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay, Art Direction, and Costume Design.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000048PO", "B00003CXC9", "6302728657", "6303052223", "6301965817"], "bought_together": ["B0000048PO", "B00003CXC9"], "also_viewed": ["B004SIP7D0", "B0015LPRSI"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 195581}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 23.98, "brand": "", "asin": "6300250512", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/417J0G7GBCL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "A Room With a View [VHS]"}

{"description": "When it comes down to naming the best Western of all time, the list usually narrows to three completely different pictures: John Ford'sThe Searchers, Howard Hawks'sRed River, and Hawks'sRio Bravo. About the only thing they all have in common is that they all star John Wayne. But whileThe Searchersis an epic quest for revenge andRed Riveris a sweeping cattle-drive drama (\"Take 'em to Missouri! Yeeee-hah!\"),Rio Bravois on a much more modest scale. Basically, it comes down to Sheriff John T. Chance (Wayne), his sobering-up alcoholic friend Dude (Dean Martin), the hotshot new kid Colorado (Ricky Nelson), and deputy-sidekick Stumpy (Walter Brennan), sittin' around in the town jail, drinkin' black cofee, shootin' the breeze, and occasionally, singin' a song. Hawks--who, like his pal Ernest Hemingway, lived by the code of \"grace under pressure\"--said he madeRio Bravoas a rebuke toHigh Noon, in which sheriff Gary Cooper begged for townspeople to help him. So, Hawks made Wayne's Sheriff Chance a consummate professional--he may be getting old and fat, but he knows how to do his job, and he doesn't want amateurs getting mixed up in his business; they could get hurt. This most entertaining of movies also achieved some notoriety in the '90s when Quentin Tarantino (director ofPulp Fiction,Reservoir Dogs, andJackie Brown) revealed that he uses it as a litmus test for prospective girlfriends. Oh, and if the configuration of characters sounds familiar, it should: Hawks remadeRio Bravotwo more times--asEl Doradoin 1967, with Wayne, Robert Mitchum, and James Caan; and asRio Loboin 1970, with Wayne, Jack Elam, and Christopher Mitchum.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792110188", "6301802330", "6300267938", "6304457308", "0792106989", "630197705X", "6300268799", "6300181588", "6301798090", "B000GX4476", "0792107128", "6304457316", "6304457278", "B000051S3Z", "6300183041", "0782008348", "0792105907", "6302320496", "6303471730", "B0018PH3L0", "B001E419N8", "B0000TANUI", "6301797922", "6301805518", "6300215733", "6300988473", "6301736362", "630150528X", "0790743213", "6303192254", "6300269884", "1555265952", "6301325508", "6300269043", "6303109950", "0792108868", "6304414099", "6304429711", "6302862906", "6303402070", "B00000I1DI", "6300216500", "0792838556", "6305237115", "B000GX7MMA", "6302990076", "B000056BRF", "630281622X", "6303101267", "0790727382", "6301976983", "6302032245", "6304286961", "6304071876"], "bought_together": ["0792110188", "6301802330"], "also_viewed": ["B000051S3Z"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 277544}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.89, "brand": "", "asin": "6300268470", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5127ECYB5EL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Rio Bravo [VHS]"}

Ed Harris and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, as formerly married petroleum engineers who still have some \"issues\" to work out, are drafted to assist a gung-ho Navy SEAL (Michael Biehn) with a top-secret recovery operation: a nuclear sub has been ambushed and sunk, under mysterious circumstances, in some of the deepest waters on earth, and the petro-techies have the only submersible craft capable of diving down that far. Every image and every performance is painstakingly sharp and detailed (and the computerized water creatures are lovely) but the movie's lumbering pace is ultimately lethal. It's the audience that ends up feeling waterlogged. For a guy who likes guns as much as Cameron (his next film after all, was the body-count masterpieceTerminator&nbsp;2: Judgment Day), it's interesting that the moral balance here is weighted heavily in favor of the can-do engineers; the military types are end-justifies-the-means amoralists, just like the weasely government bureaucrats inAliens.--David Chute", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301208773", "0767825411", "6305363668", "1558808221", "6300247171", "B00006RCSC", "6303148352", "6303257844", "B00000JGEI", "6303942830", "6305142467", "6303313345", "B000003KHS", "630407185X", "6304233639", "6304071876", "6300214826", "B000005QWI", "6303020089", "6302909023", "6301562178", "0800132009", "B00000ILE6", "B0001VL30O", "0800116917", "6303269834", "B0000CDL3W", "079073799X", "0783222955", "6301628454", "B00007CVYA", "6305718792", "B000054OW2", "6304259131"], "also_viewed": ["B00000JGEI", "6301792734", "6305363668", "6300213668", "6301208773", "6304233639", "0800125762", "6300213730", "6303402348", "6300214435", "6304117752", "0671676253", "6302814782", "0792151712", "0790740265", "6303257844", "B002GHHHKQ", "6303313345", "B001AQO3QA", "B007SPPANM", "B0087F7VSY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 435209}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.96, "brand": "", "asin": "6301562941", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/11JCR407ZAL.jpg", "title": "Abyss [VHS]"}

{"description": "This is a supremely disappointing film, especially considering the talent involved. Indeed, the cast would seem to be the summit of African American comedians, starring the three most influential standups of the modern era: Redd Foxx, Richard Pryor, and Eddie Murphy. Murphy obviously was paying respect to his elders when he cast them as his father and grandfather in this story of Harlem in the 1930s. Written and directed by Murphy, the plot involves gangsters and rival nightclub owners but doesn't add up. What's a particular shame is that, with three comics as funny as Murphy, Pryor, and Foxx, there are so few laughs and so much misogyny. Do you really want to watch Della Reese get shot in the foot to shut her up? That's the level of the humor here.--Marshall Fine", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 406399}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6301661206", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/513DRFQM29L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Harlem Nights [VHS]"}
{"description": "Rebeccais an ageless, timeless adult movie about a woman who marries a widower but fears she lives in the shadow of her predecessor. This was Hitchcock's first American feature, and it garnered the Best Picture statue at the 1941 Academy Awards. In today's films, most twists and surprises are ridiculous or just gratuitous, so it's sobering to look back on this film where every revelation not only shocks, but makes organic sense with the story line. Laurence Olivier is dashing and weak, fierce and cowed. Joan Fontaine is strong yet submissive, defiant yet accommodating. There isn't a false moment or misstep, but the film must have killed the employment outlook of any women named Danvers for about 20 years.

{"description": "Part mystery, part wartime polemic,Lifeboatfinds director Alfred Hitchcock tackling a cinematic challenge that foreshadows the self-imposed handicaps ofRopeandRear Window. As with those subsequent features, Hitchcock confines his action and characters to a single set, in this instance the lone surviving lifeboat from an Allied freighter sunk by a German U-boat in the North Atlantic. A less confident, ingenious filmmaker might have opened up John Steinbeck's dialogue-driven character study beyond the battered boat and its cargo of survivors, but Hitchcock instead revels in his predicament to exploit the enforced intimacy between his characters.Indeed, we never actually see the doomed freighter--the smoking ship's funnel beneath the credits simply sinks beneath the waves, and we're plunged into the escalating tensions between those who gradually find their way to the boat, a band of eight English and American passengers and crew, plus a German sailor (Walter Slezak) rescued from the U-boat, itself destroyed by the freighter's deck gun. Heading the cast and inevitably commanding their and our attention is the cello-voiced Tallulah Bankhead as Connie Porter, a cynical, sophisticated writer whose priorities seem to be hanging onto her mink and keeping her lipstick fresh. Gradually, the others find Porter and her lifeboat, forming a temporary community that inevitably suggests a careful cross section of archetypes, from wealthy industrialist (Henry Hull) to ship's boiler men (John Hodiak and William Bendix).Hitchcock juggles the interpersonal skirmishes between the boat's occupants with the mystery of their German prisoner, which itself becomes a meditation on the fine line between nationalism and morality, a line that Slezak walks delicately until his identity is resolved. Visually, Hitchcock transforms his back-lot set and its rear-projected cloudbanks into a desolate stretch of ocean, while capturing the horror of an amputation through an economical set of images culminating in an empty boot.--Sam Sutherland", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0045HCJ9E", "6302413435", "0783236352", "B002GSXKQA", "0790743159", "1558807780", "6301800974", "0783235623", "0769403468", "6301640667", "6301975987", "6301973232", "1558808590", "630150528X", "0800100832", "6301564456", "6302226899", "6301959728", "B000EVD38G", "B00004R67T", "6302909023", "B00005Q4GY", "6304457316", "0790743213", "6300246965", "6301798503", "6302360978", "0783221347", "6301797957", "6301973410", "6300183580", "6304196954", "6301798708", "B000056BRF", "6302842263", "6304359705", "0792108280", "079074886X"], "also_viewed": ["B001D8W7F4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 319371}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6301798732", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51AC1NXHYzL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Lifeboat (The Hitchcock Collection) [VHS]"}

{"description": "A flawed but stylish adaptation of the Chester Gould comic strip by director Warren Beatty, who also stars in the title role. The minimalist plot involves a battalion of baddies who confront the intrepid detective in a series of strung-together vignettes. Al Pacino is a comedic if overblown standout as Big Boy Caprice, and Madonna simply smolders as aggressive blonde bombshell Breathless Mahoney. It matters not that the plot is Spartan, as this dazzling eye candy is much enhanced by Stephen Sondheim's songs, including the Academy Award-winning ditty, \"Sooner or Later (I Always Get My Man).\" Beatty took his cue from the source material and concentrated on the relationships between these people, whether strained, romantic, or hateful. The performances are subtle and more amusing than you would expect from such a visually bold picture. Shot in bright, primary colors, this also won Oscars for Best Art/Set Direction and Makeup (for those inventively hideous criminals).

{"description": "Sometimes simplicity can be heartbreaking. So it is withThe Clock, a wonderfully simple love story that stands as one of the gems of the MGM golden years. It should be noted right off that this 1945 film is not a musical, despite a talent roster led by the maestro of MGM musicals, producer Arthur Freed. Rather, it's a straight, black and white romance about a soldier (Robert Walker) with a two-day pass in unfamiliar, overwhelming New York City. He meets an office worker (Judy Garland), and in the glow of the city and each other, they fall in love. Underlying the sweetness of the romance is the time limit of the soldier's leave, after which he will be sent overseas; the clock brings an urgency to the action, especially after the lovers lose each other in the crush of a subway. Veteran character actor James Gleason provides lovely support, as does his real-life wife, Lucile. Director Vincente Minnelli brought his designer's eye to the film, turning (by his own avowed intention) New York City itself into the third main character in the drama. It's not difficult to guess the reason for the film's strong emotional tug, or for Judy Garland's radiance; Minnelli had fallen in love with Garland during the making ofMeet Me in St. Louisa year earlier, and they would marry after filmingThe Clock. She was never lovelier than in these two pictures.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["630266232X", "6300181111", "B0009J2F1E", "6301977084", "6301967496", "0792840844"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 380091}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 36.88, "brand": "", "asin": "6301967070", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41TNTPM0X1L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Clock [VHS]"}
{"description": "No director could ever have hoped to repeat the artistic achievement of Stanley Kubrick's2001: A Space Odyssey, and nobody knew that better than Peter Hyams, who made this much more conventional film from the first of three sequel novels by Arthur C. Clarke. Whereas Kubrick made a poetic film of mind-expanding ideas and metaphysical mysteries, Hyams shouldn't be blamed for taking a more practical, crowd-pleasing approach. In revealing much of what Kubrick deliberately left unexplained,2010lacks the enigmatic awe of its predecessor, but it's still a riveting tale of space exploration and extraterrestrial contact, beginning when a joint American-Soviet mission embarks to determine the cause of failure of the derelict spaceshipDiscovery.  Having arrived atDiscoverynear the planet Jupiter, the American mission leader (Roy Scheider) and his Russian counterpart (Helen Mirren) must investigate the apparent failure of the ship's infamous onboard computer, HAL 9000, as well as the meaning of countless mysterious black monoliths amassing on Jupiter's surface (an interpretation Kubrick originally left up to his viewers). Meanwhile, Earth is on the brink of nuclear war, and an apparition of astronaut David Bowman (Keir Dullea) appears to repeatedly promise that \"something wonderful\" is about to happen.--Jeff Shannon", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 492181}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6301963660", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/410PMMK1VFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "2010: The Year We Make Contact [VHS]"}

{"description": "Lust for Lifeis appropriately titled, for merepassionseems inadequate when describing this superb fictionalized biography (based on Irving Stone's popular novel) of Vincent Van Gogh. In a deservedly Oscar&reg;- nominated performance, Kirk Douglas is physically and emotionally perfect as the tormented Dutch painter, whose life is chronicled from his ill-fated stint as a preacher to Belgian miners in 1878, to his Impressionist-inspired artistic awakening and psychological descent to suicide in 1890. Having triumphed with 1952'sThe Bad and the Beautiful, Douglas, producer John Houseman, and director Vincente Minnelli brought vigor and vitality to this blessed project, which centers on Van Gogh's stormy friendship with fellow artist Gaugin (Oscar-winner Anthony Quinn). Minnelli used an outmoded color film process and innovative camera techniques to vividly recreate Van Gogh's paintings, and he filmed on the actual Dutch and French locations where Van Gogh's mastery flourished. The artist's lust for life also fed his madness, and this film deeply understands the fine line in between.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0452262496", "6301628667", "6301628616", "B000056BRF", "6303037380", "630266232X"], "bought_together": ["0452262496"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 216652}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6301971191", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51YCP9MZK5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Lust for Life [VHS]"}

When people describe documentaries using the \"Ken Burns approach,\" its style is understood: voice-over narrators reading letters and documents dramatically and stating the writer's name at their conclusion, fresh live footage of places juxtaposed with still images (photographs, paintings, maps, prints), anecdotal interviews, and romantic musical scores taken from the era he depicts.The Civil Waruses all of these devices to evoke atmosphere and resurrect an event that many knew only from stale history books. While Burns is a historian, a researcher, and a documentarian, he's above all a gifted storyteller, and it's his narrative powers that give this chronicle its beauty, overwhelming emotion, and devastating horror. Using the words of old letters, eloquently read by a variety of celebrities, the stories of historians like Shelby Foote and rare, stained photos, Burns allows us not only to relearn and finally understand our history, but also to feel and experience it.--Dave McCoy", "related": {"also_bought": ["6304209908", "6303218725", "B000R7NBMK", "B002BO2R4K", "630428957X", "0780618831", "B000BITUI4", "B003S1UNZU", "B0089VX0UO", "B004NJC0R0", "B00A2XTHYU", "B00003CXA6", "B004FGA2HQ", "B007VYEF04", "B009AMANBA", "B000050HEQ", "6303026109", "630272001X", "B00005N900", "0780620135", "6304383657"], "bought_together": ["6304209908"], "also_viewed": ["B000BITUFC", "B000R7NBMK", "6303218725", "6304209908", "0394749138", "B003S1UNZU", "B00JDCFQ6E", "0394562852", "B000ANVQ50", "0705425312", "B0002F6AH0", "0345348109", "B00003CXA6", "B0086IMN80", "6303026109", "B000T28PFQ", "B000BITUHU", "019516895X", "6303696627", "B000NTPDSW", "B00AQNOCZ0", "B00JAQJMJ0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 188197}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 85.0, "brand": "", "asin": "6301996135", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61MYX3J1YSL._SX300_.jpg", "title": "The Civil War - A Film by Ken Burns (Boxed Set) [VHS]"}

{"description": "The swashbuckler had been around long before Errol Flynn drew a cutlass, but the Tasmanian-born bit player reinvigorated the genre with his mix of dashing good looks, haughty insolence, and alluring confidence. Adapted from the novel by Rafael Sabatini (who also pennedThe Sea Hawk), this rousing adventure chronicles the travails of Peter Blood (Flynn), a righteous doctor unjustly sold into slavery for treating the wounds of rebels, a kind of British Dr. Mudd. Sent to a Jamaican plantation where he toils under the brutal whip of Lionel Atwill and seethes with passion for his fair niece (the astonishingly beautiful Olivia de Havilland), he escapes from bondage with his fellow prisoners and becomes the gentleman rogue pirate of the Caribbean. Director Michael Curtiz builds from one set piece to another, including a nimble beachside sword fight with pirate nemesis Basil Rathbone and climaxing with a grand sea battle that belies the film's modest budget. Flynn's bravado and charisma are apparent from his entrance, but once he leaps into action he takes command of the picture, overcoming his still-green dramatic skills with sheer personality.Captain Bloodmade stars of Flynn and de Havilland and catapulted Curtiz to the top ranks of Warner directors.

{"description": "This '90s update of the Spencer Tracy-Elizabeth Taylor hit is a mix of the pleasant and the silly, a nice enough movie but a little too controlled to become particularly interesting. Steve Martin plays the aging patriarch who is threatened by his daughter's engagement and not-quite-willing to let her go. The writing-directing team of Charles Shyer and Nancy Meyers provides Martin's character with a perhaps too-broad range of comic responsiveness to the situation, some of it gentle (a ritual game of basketball between dad and his little girl) and some of it slapstick (Martin sneaking around his prospective in-laws' house and encountering a guard dog).

{"description": "Cheyenne Autumnis a beautiful title to grace John Ford's final  Western, but the film falls short of the occasion. The great director's ambition  to tell the story, for once, from the Indians' point of view is only partially  fulfilled. He's unambiguously sympathetic to the Cheyennes' resolve to bolt the  reservation and trek back to their ancestral lands, while most of white society,  the military, the bureaucracy, and the sensationalist press come off as  insensitive, foolish, or downright hateful. However, the Cheyenne are nobly  wooden (and played by non-Indians), and it's sympathetic cavalry officer Richard  Widmark and Quaker missionary Carroll Baker through whose eyes most of the epic  narrative unfolds. The video release restores the entirety of the caustic Dodge  City interlude (featuring James Stewart as a thoroughly disreputable Wyatt  Earp)--truncated after the New York roadshow opening--but William H. Clothier's  majestic Panavision compositions have yet to be letterboxed.--Richard T.

{"description": "A married man, left alone during a hot summer, fantasizes madly about the impossibly gorgeous woman living in the upstairs apartment. When the woman is Marilyn Monroe, such fantasies are the stuff of epics, andThe Seven Year Itchis a memorable laugh machine. Tom Ewell, repeating his role from George Axelrod's Broadway hit, plays the itchy protagonist, whose vivid imagination gets the better of him. When Monroe finally comes downstairs and becomes friends (confiding, among other things, that she keeps her undies in the icebox in this hot weather), imagination meets reality in a merciless attack on the male libido. Ewell's crack timing is matched by Monroe's zesty comic flair, and the scene in which her white dress is blown skyward by a passing subway train has entered the encyclopedia of great movie images. Director Billy Wilder adapted the play with Axelrod; if the film is not one of Wilder's signature works (Some Like It HotandThe Apartmentwould soon follow), it is nevertheless a smoothly crafted comedy.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792837096", "6302484383", "6302484391", "B0000068ZQ", "6300269256", "6304056877", "6302484421", "B00000F13T", "630428635X", "6302305942", "6300213668", "6305123616", "6302842263", "0783235607", "0783235593", "6300215814", "6301734734", "B000005PPB", "0782008348", "6301798562", "6300183513", "6300267865", "6301797957", "6303333079"], "bought_together": ["0792837096", "6302484383"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 316658}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.93, "brand": "", "asin": "6302484405", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41JVFJDFCQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Seven Year Itch [VHS]"}

{"description": "Like moths to a flame, great actors gravitate to the singular genius of playwright-screenwriter David Mamet, who updated his Pulitzer Prize-winning play for this all-star screen adaptation. The material is not inherently cinematic, so the movie's greatest asset is Mamet's peerless dialogue and the assembly of a once-in-a-lifetime cast led by Al Pacino, Jack Lemmon, and Alec Baldwin (the last in a role Mamet created especially for the film). Often regarded as a critique of the Reagan administration's impact on the American economy, the play and film focus on a competitive group of real estate salesmen who've gone from feast to famine in a market gone cold. When an executive \"motivator\" (Alec Baldwin) demands a sales contest among the agents in the cramped office, the stakes are critically high: any agent who fails to meet his quota of sales \"leads\" (i.e., potential buyers) will lose his job. This intense ultimatum is a boon for the office superstar (Pacino), but a once-successful salesman (Lemmon) now finds himself clinging nervously to faded glory. Political and personal rivalries erupt under pressure when the other agents (Alan Arkin, Ed Harris) suspect the office manager (Kevin Spacey) of foul play. This cauldron of anxiety, tension, and sheer desperation provides fertile soil for Mamet's scathingly rich dialogue, which is like rocket fuel for some of the greatest actors of our time. Pacino won an Oscar nomination for his volatile performance, but it's Lemmon who's the standout, doing some of the best work of his distinguished career. Director James Foley shapes Mamet's play into a stylish, intensely focused film that will stand for decades as a testament to its brilliant writer and cast.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303515223", "1558807780"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 369412}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.3, "brand": "", "asin": "6302732875", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51S2V1ZW1GL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Glengarry Glen Ross [VHS]"}

{"description": "This sensational, extremely influential, 1974 low-budget horror movie directed by Tobe Hooper (Poltergeist,Lifeforce,Salem's Lot), may be notorious for its title, but it's also a damn fine piece of moviemaking. And it's blood-curdling scary, too. Loosely based on the true crimes of Ed Gein (also a partial inspiration forPsycho), the original Jeffrey Dahmer,Texas Chainsaw Massacrefollows a group of teenagers who pick up a hitchhiker and wind up in a backwoods horror chamber where they're held captive, tortured, chopped up, and impaled on meat hooks by a demented cannibalistic family, including a character known as Leatherface who maniacally wields one helluva chainsaw. The movie's powerful sense of dread is heightened by its grainy, semi-documentary style--but it also has a wicked sense of humor (and not that camp, self-referential variety that became so tiresome in subsequent horror films of the '70s, '80s, and '90s). OK, in case you couldn't tell, it's \"not for everyone.\" But as a landmark in the development of the horror/slasher genre, it ranks withPsycho,Halloween, andA Nightmare on Elm Street.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305095566", "0792839242", "B00023NRSM", "6304983794", "6300214087", "6300267881", "6300214311", "6300214192", "6302038308", "B00000G1XV", "0792846710", "0792836634", "1452114498", "0792839234", "B00A82A7ZS", "B00009W0TZ", "6304240562", "6300214605", "B00018D454", "0790705141", "B00000F6FN", "6300183416", "0783216084", "6302862787", "6300262855", "0780616561", "6300182770", "B0000065MW", "6300214656", "B00079Z9X2", "6301996127", "6300182878", "6304819927", "B00000IQUT", "6304509154", "6302844207", "6301969782", "0783235607", "6301094352", "6302798450", "6303031846", "B00000JQTO", "6300218058", "0783246641", "079284632X", "B0032GEL54", "6303442315", "6304370458", "630026999X", "6300263681", "6300214826", "B00000JLWQ", "630533580X", "6301961404", "0764005707", "B00007L4N7", "6304288433", "6300189015", "6303954278", "B000AMW2TK", "6301589025", "B0053TWVT6", "6302968143", "6302878772", "B0000039A6", "B00005ATQA", "B000006FZ0", "6305939616", "0780627032", "B000A0GOH8", "6303359345", "B00000JQTR"], "also_viewed": ["6300214087", "B00023NRSM", "0792839242", "B00018D454", "B00L22H2IS", "6305095566", "B00LLAV26O", "6300189015", "0792836634", "0800187164", "6301589955", "B000099T3M", "6304819927", "0780616561", "630428845X", "B00IF8Q0YE", "B0000039A6", "B000I2J68M", "6300214605", "B00BM4Q4N0", "6300214311", "6303917461", "6303506291", "630130053X", "B004RE29PO", "6304509154", "B000VKL6Z2", "B00BCMT2BI", "1452114498", "B003UGLCIA", "B00BCMSY80", "B000KJU1KK", "B002YICNE2", "0783235607", "B00C7C00JU", "B00DEQQK8S", "B00000IQUT", "B0057O6IDW", "6304983794", "B005J9ZE5I", "B00G5GNYY2", "B00JHH1VSW", "6300267881", "B002UR4GDI", "B000009NQY", "B001JFZ1UE", "B008CYDDWI", "0783216084", "B003JIPN20", "B009DA743Y", "B00DI012O2", "6301792734", "B002OVO18A", "6300182878", "6302517036", "B00LBFFR2Y"]}, "price": 24.95, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 183169}, "asin": "6302921058", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71DZX9N6ZZL._SY300_.gif", "title": "Texas Chainsaw Massacre [VHS]"}

{"description": "This huge 1993 hit for Robin Williams and director Chris Columbus (Home Alone), based on a novel calledAlias Madame Doubtfireby Anne Fine, stars Williams as a loving but flaky father estranged from his frustrated wife (Sally Field). Devastated by a court order limiting his time with the children, Williams's character disguises himself as a warm, old British nanny who becomes the kids' best friend. As with Dustin Hoffman's performance inTootsie, Williams's drag act--buried under layers of latex and padding--is the show, and everything and everyone else on screen serves his sometimes frantic role. Since that's the case, it's fortunate that Williams is Williams, and his performance is terribly funny at times and exceptionally believable in those scenes where his character misses his children. Playing Williams's brother, a professional makeup artist, Harvey Fierstein has a good support role in a bright sequence where he tries a number of feminine looks on Williams before settling on Mrs. Doubtfire's visage.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302091632", "6302800420", "6303257844", "6302765536", "630339406X", "B00329TVQA", "6302581907", "6303140157", "6300247236", "6304416415", "B00004XPQQ", "B000005PFL", "0800196767", "B000008IPR", "0783230893", "B000007OY0", "6304500718", "6302089654", "6303409997", "6300213668", "630273973X", "6304311834", "6302426200"], "bought_together": ["6302800420"], "also_viewed": ["0792151712", "6302961572", "6303314015", "6304233639", "0788806270", "0788812408", "B00005JKDQ", "6304290888", "6303983812", "0788812807", "6302765536", "155890641X", "6305229449", "0788805843", "0788811002", "B00003CXXI", "B00003CXQX", "6301966988", "6304089767", "0790727382", "6303402348", "6304500831", "B0000DCGT1", "6305326940", "5554458521", "6302091632", "6304401132", "B00007J88X"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 106101}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.95, "brand": "20th Century Fox", "asin": "6303049079", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51lvoybRsfL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Mrs Doubtfire [VHS]"}

Harriet Andersson plays Karin, a psychiatric patient newly released from a hospital and staying in the island home where she found some measure of security in childhood. Instead of getting on her feet, however, Karin begins disintegrating after realizing she no longer loves her physician husband (Max von Sydow) and is being rather coldly observed by her writer father (Gunnar Bjornstrand), whose distant fascination with her plight is recorded in his daily journal. Hearing voices, believing God to be a spider, and pursuing an incestuous relationship with her brother, Karin slips into an inexorable decline, objectively witnessed by those too emotionally frozen to help.

The full title isTim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas, which should give you an idea of the tone of this stop-action animated musical/fantasy/horror/comedy.  It is based on characters created by Burton, the former Disney animator best known as the director ofPee-wee's Big Adventure,Beetlejuice,Edward Scissorhands, and the first twoBatmanmovies. His benignly scary-funny sensibility dominates the story of Halloweentown resident Jack Skellington (voice by Danny Elfman, who also wrote the songs), who stumbles on a bizarre and fascinating alternative universe called ...

(Actually, Ford did shoot some second-unit stuff while visiting Wayne on location.) Half-breed Hondo, companioned only by an antisocial dog, tends to be more sympathetic toward the Apaches than toward the white society he occasionally scouts for. He falls into uneasy friendship with a New Mexico farmwoman (Geraldine Page) whose husband deserts her for long stretches, and whose son (Lee Aaker) is blood brother to the local Apache chieftain. A good, spare frontier tale--Louis L'Amour via James Edward (Angel and the Badman) Grant--in which danger and solace come in unexpected ways.

{"description": "South African director William C. Faure (who died in 1994) originally createdShaka Zuluas a 1983 miniseries broadcast in the U.K. Later released for theaters, this is the best-known biography of, and certainly one of the longest narratives about, the legendary Zulu warrior-king, Shaka. The story follows Shaka's life in detail from his illegitimate birth around 1787 to a commoner, Nandi, through his tormented childhood at the Zulu court. Virtually disowned by his father Senzangakhona, the scrawny and introverted Shaka grows into a tall, commanding presence played by Henry Cele (The Ghost and the DarknessandThe Light in the Jungle). Cele's subtle but powerful performance is fundamental to the impact of this epic--which, though slow here and there, commands our attention and humanizes the legend of Shaka appealingly. After proving himself a worthy warrior and rising in the ranks of a necessarily more militant society, Shaka lends his influential support to King Dingiswayo who unifies the Zulu Nation under the domination of his Mthethwa tribe. At Dingiswayo's death, Shaka accedes to the Zulu throne from which he expands the Zulu empire through successive military successes over all of Natal (today, KwaZulu-Natal). Faure's story is distinct from other pre-apartheid accounts of Shaka's life in its positive retelling of the Zulu Nation's rise to dominance in western South Africa and in its admixture of military and personal history. In this account, Shaka is not merely the intangible father of a nation but a common man whose life both challenged and taught him to lead.--Erik Macki", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B009AQ8D5E", "6303085547", "B00008PC13", "B002KLA9CQ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 323926}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 13.98, "brand": "", "asin": "6303274714", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71PZ790NG3L._SY300_.gif", "title": "Shaka Zulu [VHS]"}
{"description": "\"Watching it is like seeing a poem for the eyes.\" That's howChicago Sun-Timescritic Roger Ebert described this exquisite, Oscar-nominated, French-Vietnamese film from 1993, which begins in the 1950s and ends more than a decade later during the early years of the Vietnam war. The story is set almost entirely in a Saigon house where a 10-year-old orphan girl named Mui arrives to work as a servant. As she grows into a beautiful young woman, Mui is quietly and carefully observant of everything around her, from the scent of green papaya (hence the title) to the relationship between her employers. The film takes its visual cues from Mui's observations--it's a placid, soothing film that lingers over the physical and emotional details of its setting and story.What's really astonishing about this beautiful film is that director Anh Tran Hung shot it entirely on a soundstage in Paris, but the sights and sounds are so completely convincing that you'd swear the setting is an actual home in Saigon. This remarkable craftsmanship remains invisible to the viewer, and the seductive progression of the story unfolds with exacting visual precision. It's a film about Mui's growth and development, but also about her benevolent effect on the world around her. As such, it's a movie to savor like no other, life affirming and glorious in the memorable depth of its captivating simplicity.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00000F2AF"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 418836}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.89, "brand": "", "asin": "6303379222", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51TMM4N91SL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Scent of Green Papaya [VHS]"}

{"description": "This stirring 1994 work by Louis Malle brought the legendary French filmmaker into another collaboration with actors-writers-directors Andre Gregory and Wallace Shawn, scribes and stars of the greatMy Dinner with Andre. The situation here is that Shawn and Gregory were participants in a years-long, informal project remounting a production of Chekhov'sUncle Vanyaevery few months for select friends and the general worthiness of the idea. Wearing street clothes and strolling to a crumbling New Amsterdam theater on Broadway, actors Shawn, Julianne Moore, George Gaynes, Brooke Smith, Larry Pine, Phoebe Brand, Lynn Cohen, and others would do a full run of the text (as sharply translated by David Mamet) while a beaming Gregory (the play's director) looked on. Malle--who died following this film--spent a few days transforming the theatrical experiment into a viable film that maintained the company's unusual purpose and spirit. The result is something between a narrative feature and a documentary about an acting workshop, and is both highly entertaining and cinematically enthralling. A terrific final note in Malle's distinguished career, this is a must-see for anyone who cared about his work or who has a passion for Chekhov.--Tom Keogh", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 425307}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.98, "brand": "", "asin": "630349918X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51D5KYG27EL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Vanya on 42nd Street [VHS]"}

{"description": "David Lean focused all his talent as an epic-maker on Boris Pasternak's sweeping novel about a doctor-poet in revolutionary Russia. The results may sometimes veer toward soap opera, especially with the screen frequently filled with adoring close-ups of Omar Sharif and Julie Christie, but Lean's gift for cramming the screen with spectacle is not to be denied. The streets of Moscow, the snowy steppes of Russia, the house in the country taken over by ice; these are re-created with Lean's unerring sense of grandness. The movie is so lush and so long that it becomes an irresistible wallow, even when logic suffers--likeGone with the Windbefore it andTitanicafter.

{"description": "Sunday Bloody Sundayis a masterpiece from the days when movies, in general, were much more mature. As written by renowned film critic Penelope Gilliatt and directed by John Schlesinger, this complicated love triangle among three upscale Londoners was a milestone for its time, not simply for its nonchalant treatment of a homosexual relationship, but for illustrating the way sensible adults will negotiate for love, even if it's inconvenient or destined to fail. A doctor in his forties, Daniel (Peter Finch, proving his greatness seven years beforeNetwork) loves the much younger artist Bob (Murray Head), who also loves employment counselor Alex (Glenda Jackson at her finest). There's no deception between them--just the troubling dilemma of three lovers with differing degrees of certainty and commitment. Bob's relative blandness is the film's only weakness, but it's tolerable in a drama so deeply understanding of complex human behavior. Deliberately paced but immensely rewarding to the attentive viewer, this was Schlesinger's follow-up toMidnight Cowboy--two great films by a director in his prime.--Jeff Shannon", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 555377}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.5, "brand": "", "asin": "6304005962", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Q9AWF6K5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Sunday Bloody Sunday [VHS]"}

Determining to read a letter written by executed anarchistic Bartolomeo Vanzetti to his classroom,Tommy not only risks dismissal and castigation by the conservative college trustees, but seriously jeopardizes his marriage to his wife Ellen (Olivia DeHavilland), who wishes that Tommy would stop making waves and start lobbying for a raise. Coinciding with all this is the arrival of former college football star Joe Ferguson (Jack Carson), who many years earlier had been Tommy's rival for Ellen's affections. Eminently successful and aggressively athletic, Joe seems to be everything that Tommy isn't, and the little professor is worried that he's going to lose Ellen to Joe after all. An all-night drinking session with equally idealistic student Michael Barnes (Herbert Anderson) convinces Tommy to stick to his principles no matter what the cost-and miracle of miracles, this resolve makes him a hero in everyone's eyes, including sweet Ellen.

{"description": "In the mid-to-late 1990s, Iran began to be recognized as a refreshing source of low-budget, wryly naturalistic filmmaking, and Jafar Panahi'sThe White Balloon(winner of the Camera d'Or award at the 1995 Cannes Film Festival) was the first Iranian film to get a U.S. art-house release. Simple and spare yet filled with observant detail, it's a mild, beguiling movie about a 7-year-old girl's tenacious quest to buy a cherished goldfish for her family's New Year's Day celebration. That's really all there is to it, but it's wonderfully warm, funny, and generous in spirit. With an almost miraculous ability to capture moments and reality unhindered by the presence of a camera and crew, Panahi handles this seemingly trivial story as a child's emotional odyssey, set amidst the daily rhythms of Teheran as a city where kindness and cruelty can be found in close proximity. Anyone interested in international films and filmmakers should give this one high priority on their list of must-see movies.--Jeff Shannon", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 295955}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "title": "The White Balloon [VHS]", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B000S0GYD4", "B000065V3Z", "6305362688", "B00005RRJE", "B002VRNJT4"]}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/210X9V7ZSRL.jpg", "asin": "6304274793"}

{"description": "After Martin Scorsese went to Hollywood in 1972 to direct the low-budgetBoxcar Berthafor B-movie mogul Roger Corman, the young director showed the film to maverick director John Cassavetes and got an instant earful of urgent advice. \"It's crap,\" said Cassavetes in no uncertain terms, \"now go out and make something that comes from your heart.\" Scorsese took the advice and focused his energy onMean Streets, a riveting contemporary film about low-life gangsters in New York's Little Italy that critic Pauline Kael would later call \"a true original, and a triumph of personal filmmaking.\" Starring Robert De Niro and Harvey Keitel in roles that announced their talent to the world, it set the stage for Scorsese's emergence as one of the greatest American filmmakers. Introducing themes and character types that Scorsese would return to inTaxi Driver,GoodFellas,Casino, and other films, the loosely structured story is drawn directly from Scorsese's background in the Italian neighborhoods of New York, and it seethes with the raw vitality of a filmmaker who has found his creative groove. As the irresponsible and reckless Johnny Boy, De Niro offers striking contrast to Keitel's Charlie, who struggles to reconcile gang life with Catholic guilt. More of an episodic portrait than a plot-driven crime story,Mean Streetsremains one of Scorsese's most direct and fascinating films--a masterful calling card for a director whose greatness was clearly apparent from that point forward.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0790733927", "6302842263", "630026887X", "B000005PPB", "6302816629", "6301564456"], "also_viewed": ["6302066891", "6303534368"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 426972}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6304457375", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51CA63GNNXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Mean Streets [VHS]"}
{"description": "What would the average sensible American do if he encountered a pulsing ball of protoplasm from outer space? That's right: he'd poke it with a stick. Thus begins the endearingly earnest and silly tale of The Blob. Young Steve McQueen takes on his first leading role as, um, Steve, a spunky teenager with plenty of heart. Steve sees the blob kill the local doc, but darn it, none of the town's adults will believe him! Yup, it's up to the teens to save the day! Steve and his trusty girlfriend Jane break their curfews(!) and head off into the night to find the Blob and warn the town. The Blob is a completely enjoyable watch from start to finish, offering the triple pleasures of 1950s morals, gee-whiz acting, and a whole lotta extras running around and screaming. The special effects, though primitive, certainly get the job done, and it is still a treat to watch the Blob ooze its way to its next meal. You may notice that the theme song is surprisingly bouncy for a horror flick (\"Beware of the Blob! It creeps, and leaps, and glides and slides across the floor\").

{"description": "Catherine Deneuve and David Bowie are rich, beautiful, and oh-so chic as denizens of the night. Dressed in sleek outfits and stylish sunglasses, they haunt rock & roll clubs on the prowl for young blood, whom they bring home to their impossibly luxurious mansion for a late-night snack.  Being a vampire never looked more sexy, but there's a price: Bowie starts to age so fast he wrinkles up in the waiting room of a doctor's (Susan Sarandon) office. The agelessly elegant Deneuve, evoking Delphine Seyrig's Countess Bathory fromDaughters of Darkness, is perfectly cast as a millenniums-old bloodsucker who seeks a new mate in Sarandon and seduces her in a sunlight-bathed afternoon of smooth, silky sex. Tony Scott's (Ridley's brother) directorial debut, adapted from the Whitley Strieber novel, revises the vampire myth with Egyptian inflections and removes all references to garlic and crosses and wooden stakes--these bloodsuckers can even walk around in the daylight--but the ties between blood and sex are as strong as ever. Scott's background as an award-winning commercial director is evident in every richly textured frame and his densely interwoven editing, but the moody atmosphere comes at the expense of dramatic urgency. At times the film is so languid it becomes mired in its hazy, impeccably designed visual style. In its own way,The Hungeris the perfect vampire film for the '80s, all poise and attitude and surface beauty. Sarandon talks candidly about the film in the documentaryThe Celluloid Closet.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00000I1GO"], "bought_together": ["B00000I1GO"], "also_viewed": ["6302491908"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 278584}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.75, "brand": "", "asin": "6304509103", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51793HKSJ8L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Hunger [VHS]"}

The original title for this quintessential creature bash translates asGodzilla Electric Battle Masterpiece, which just about says it all.--Andrew Wright", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000P24FAE", "B0000VAGXU", "B0000039LT", "B001AR0D40", "6303953484", "B0000VAGXK", "B00003L9CB", "0767825489", "B0000039LO", "B000VXWK86", "6302241693", "B000BMY2L0", "B00I462XF2", "B0001AVZ9Y", "B00066KWCY", "6303953492", "B0006SGYLK", "B0088FS1DC", "B0000039LU", "0764001035", "B00003CXLS", "B000OCY7IU", "0767801601", "B007WETMRY", "B00I462Y60", "0767824008", "B009ERJY6G", "B009ERK122", "B000OCY7IK", "B00I462X7K", "0767823990", "B000MV8AJU", "B00125WAYQ", "6302881153", "6304911750", "B000EHQTZO", "B002DQSKLU", "B00125WAYG", "B0024FAG2G", "6304911769", "B000JU8H7E", "B000E1BXFG", "B00005LKIE", "630362572X", "B000BB18JK", "0783103107", "076780161X", "B000FHFM7E", "B000003KJX", "6304911734", "0767824016", "B0009G3BPG", "B0000039LV", "B000FDFSYU", "B000R0EB1M", "B000AC7P2Y", "B001162GIG"], "also_viewed": ["B00I462X7K", "6303953484", "B00I462Y60", "B00JQYUXY4", "B0000039LO", "B009ERJY6G", "B000VXWK86", "B00I462XF2", "6303953492", "B00125WAYQ", "B00IQAUO2A", "B0051WTODQ", "B0002V7OE2", "B0000039LT", "B0000039LU", "B000CFVGBA", "B0024FAG2G", "B00006FD9J", "B00IQAUO5C", "B000P24FAE", "B00EVEMMRU", "6304911734", "B007WETMRY", "B0000VAGXU", "B00125WAYG", "0767824016", "B000JU8H7E", "B002HTCOCO", "6301474961", "6302241693", "0767801601", "B00066KWCO", "6304911769", "B00006FDEB", "B005ENCIWG", "0767825489", "B0009WX2R2", "B000BMY2L0", "B00I3C1T7A", "B000OCY7IU", "B00IAO618S", "B001AR0D40", "B0040HYLF4", "B001UQYISS", "B000EHQTZO", "B000003KJX", "0679888225", "B0039YOK8W", "B00IYU1FZW", "6302881153", "B00LMCDHMS", "B004GGU9M8", "B00I099JWI"]}, "price": 15.28, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 286262}, "asin": "6304891784", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51WHYX16VJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Destroy All Monsters [VHS]"}

{"description": "The curiosity of Quentin Tarantino'sJackie Brownis Robert Forster's worldly wise bail bondsman Max Cherry, the most alive character in this adaptation of Elmore Leonard'sRum Punch. The Academy Awards saw it the same way, giving Forster the film's only nomination. The film is more \"rum\" than \"punch\" and will certainly disappoint those who are looking for Tarantino's trademark style. This movie is a slow, decaffeinated story of six characters glued to a half million dollars brought illegally into the country. The money belongs to Ordell (Samuel&nbsp;L. Jackson), a gunrunner just bright enough to control his universe and do his own dirty work. His just-paroled friend--a loose term with Ordell--Louis (Robert De Niro) is just taking up space and could be interested in the money. However, his loyalties are in question between his old partner and Ordell's doped-up girl (Bridget Fonda). Certainly Fed Ray Nicolette (Michael Keaton) wants to arrest Ordell with the illegal money. The key is the title character, a late-40s-ish flight attendant (Pam Grier) who can pull her own weight and soon has both sides believing she's working for them. The end result is rarely in doubt, and what is left is two hours of Tarantino's expert dialogue as he moves his characters around town.Tarantino changed the race of Jackie and Ordell, a move that means little except that it allows Tarantino to heap on black culture and language, something he has a gift and passion for. He said this film is for an older audience although the language and drug use may put them off. The film is not a salute to Grier's blaxploitation films beyond the musical score. Unexpectedly the most fascinating scenes are between Grier and Forster: two neo-stars glowing in the limelight of their first major Hollywood film after decades of work.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000X81ZI", "6303953425", "B00006G8O1", "B000286RJI", "6304106017", "B000067DGJ", "6305095566", "B0000633ZP", "6302968100", "6302816580", "B000056V73", "630504077X", "630300394X"], "bought_together": ["B0000X81ZI"], "also_viewed": ["B009B0OG1O", "630268644X", "6300183211"]}, "price": 9.85, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 236793}, "asin": "6305006598", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71GXP626B7L._SY300_.gif", "title": "Jackie Brown [VHS]"}
{"description": "An economic crisis brings unemployed Nada (Roddy Piper) to L.A. in search of work.  What he finds instead is that the ruling elite of the world are aliens in disguise, their aim being to keep humans in a state of mindless consumerism.  His discovery comes when he dons a pair of special sunglasses made by a resistance group and sees for the first time reality unadorned.  Billboards, store signs, magazine covers--all bear subliminal messages to OBEY, to CONSUME, to have NO INDEPENDENT THOUGHT.  Money itself says THIS IS YOUR GOD. But worst of all, with these glasses you see which of us are really hideous, bug-eyed aliens.  The conceptual breakthrough is hilarious while keeping its roots in darker matters.  Although some fault the film for settling into its action plot, the ending has a great payoff. And the direction by John Carpenter is handled with superb workmanlike aplomb. One unforgettable set piece has Piper in a back-alley fistfight with a friend who won't put on the glasses that goes on and on, and just when you think it's over it goes another round. One of the most subversive films ever made in Hollywood,They Livewas released on the eve of the 1988 elections.  The first TV ads had two hideous alien politicians debating, then one accusing the other of being \"No John Kennedy!\"--Jim Gay", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00004Y87O", "B0002CHK1S", "B0000AOX0A", "B000AM6OQ2", "B000QUCQX8", "B005LS4MQY", "B0016I0AJG", "B00AKGG828", "B00AEFYDM2", "B008CYDD7I", "0783227434", "B000CNESU8", "B0002DB5PO", "B00023P4SS", "B000QQJ3Q0", "B00008974J", "0783225903", "0790731932", "B000A7Q1UQ", "B00FD81VQQ", "078062856X", "B00005K3O4", "B00005N5RM", "B0024FADD8", "B0024FAG44", "B000BR9S96", "B002E2QH7W", "0783241895", "B0053TWW36", "0783228457", "B000096FVG", "B002HML6YI", "B0053TWW9K", "B003O7I6L6", "B00AEFXR8I", "0767821629", "B00441GZ14", "B0045HCJKS", "B0001Z37HM", "6304936532", "0790729342", "B00005JOJE", "B0009X768W", "B0000AOX09", "B00006FDCD", "B000LC4Z7Q", "B00009YXHN", "B0000A08LF", "B0013LL2Z2", "B007XF0W3K", "B0010X73ZG", "B00005JL78", "B000059PP6", "B002NZK5SM", "B000FS9FCG", "B005FQ2H8W", "0792838300", "B000068IEV", "B00005PJ6M", "B000JMK6LW", "B003O7I6SE", "B00JQYV0B4", "B008DVJOQ4", "B0006210ZG", "B000UAFDR0", "B000PFUAP0", "B002NN7EY2", "0955997313", "B003UGLCIA", "B00005AVS9", "B000P0J0AQ", "B001J710Y8", "B000IJ7A5Q", "B00000JSJC", "B000OVLBHG", "B00000IREA", "6305645574", "B002I41KNC", "B00005N5S5", "B00005A3KS", "B0001FVDQ4", "B00CDV4RS0", "B0091C22AY", "B000P0J0BU", "B001PYD0PC", "6305065551", "B000MDFTHE", "B000WC3864", "157362408X", "B007FQXEXW", "B0007R4TR6", "B00008MTVY", "B0052DP1RC", "B00AEBB91E", "B00HZMZ2FE", "B005CVFZ66", "0800195175", "B001ECDVKE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0024FADBA", "B00004Y87O", "B000QUCQX8", "B0002CHK1S"]}, "price": 9.74, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 133661}, "asin": "6305077754", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51242QSSA4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "They Live"}

{"description": "Following their animated/live action hitSpace Jam, Warner Bros. jumped into the fully animated feature competition by playing it safe, giving the Arthurian legend a conspicuously Disneyesque facelift. Ingredients fromBeauty and the Beast,The Little Mermaid, andPocahontasare evident in the tale of a girl named Kayley (Jessalyn Gilsig) whose father, a Knight of the Round Table, is killed by Sir Ruber (Gary Oldman), a maniacal brute who steals Excalibur and threatens to seize King Arthur's Camelot. Kayley enlists the blind, reclusive knight-aspirant Garrett (Cary Elwes) to brave the Enchanted Forest and retrieve the magic sword, and their adventure is (of course) fraught with danger. Adding extra punch to the movie's commercial appeal, the soundtrack songs are performed by big names like LeeAnn Rimes and Celine Dion. And if that's not enough to hold a kid's attention, there's a two-headed dragon (\"we're the reason cousins shouldn't marry\") voiced by Eric Idle and Don Rickles. With so much talent involved, it's entertaining but uninspired, although cleverly harmless riffs fromDirty Harry,Taxi Driver, and other movies spice up the adventure with enjoyable pop-culture references.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6304089767", "6303499465", "0788806270", "B00014K5W8", "6302526574", "B0000AQZYM", "0780619765", "6303991408", "0788812807", "6303314015", "B00004REYY", "6300275310", "6302426200", "B00003CX7L", "6303486894", "6304400551", "630305899X", "6303614493", "0783228503", "6300213668", "6303394345", "6302313937", "6304873441", "6304155972", "6304400225", "B00005JLR1", "B00004R99N", "B00000GUNY", "B00005JMQY", "078881107X", "6302481805", "6304978286", "0790742578", "0783236689", "6304541333", "B00005RDVV", "6305310068", "B00003CXG6", "6304291353", "6301404440", "0790719029", "6302650046", "6304434340", "0790720434", "B0000714GX", "1558906150", "B00006G8LB", "B00000K4ZI", "B00005LL26", "B00003CXQ6", "0788811002", "0783230095", "B00003CXXI", "B00005LKLF", "6301157141", "B00003CXJ3", "B0006JMLT8", "630230850X", "B00000JQTX"], "bought_together": ["6303499465", "0792839420"], "also_viewed": ["B000E8QVC4", "0788812807", "6305229449", "6304434340", "B00004REYY", "6303212395", "0790742578", "B000796ND2", "B0084IHVGG", "B00003CXG7", "B002CAWNHE", "6304400225", "6303534422", "6304500831", "6304290888", "B003H9M1Q2", "6304501153", "B00014K5W8", "B000A2WARE", "B00006IUM9", "6302526574", "B00316DA9I", "6304089767", "B001ILFUD2", "6304100507", "B00CTNYLQA", "6304400551", "6303314015", "0788812408", "B003ZHVJGO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 90030}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.5, "brand": "Warner Bros.", "asin": "6305093016", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51V7MXJ3BPL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Quest for Camelot"}
{"description": "Mike Nichols directed the 1965 stage production of Neil Simon'sThe Odd Couple, but while Nichols went on to become a vitally intelligent director of contemporary comedy, Simon's career thrived in the 1970s and '80s before dwindling towards sentimental fluff like this amusing but mildly disappointing sequel. Closer toGrumpy Old Menthan the wry wit of Simon's original play and 1968 screen adaptation, the movie finds former roommates Oscar (Walter Matthau) and Felix (Jack Lemmon) reluctantly reuniting for the wedding of Oscar's son to Felix's daughter. When they get sidetracked in California, the road-movie formula unleashes the comedic chemistry of Lemmon and Matthau (which alone makes the movie worthwhile), but it's too casual to match the original's depth or dramatic foundation. Simon andGrumpydirector Howard Deutch could have deepened the Oscar-Felix relationship to make it funnier and more emotionally involving, but instead they've played it safe with some good laughs in the kind of sketch comedy that Nichols would avoid. Simon's capable of much better than this, but Lemmon-Matthau fans will have a good time anyway.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEFYRJQ", "B00020HAXI", "B0007QJ1Y8", "B000FOPPC4", "B000056HEF", "B00AEFYT1W", "B00C1TOTIC", "0790731460", "B008FYZJ2C", "6304698607", "B0022NHTD4", "B0000633R5", "B0007QJ1ZW", "B0007P0XAA", "B002GHHHGU", "B008FYZIEQ", "B00020X87K", "B0010AN7Z4", "B0024396DI", "B00AEBB9E6", "B00AEFYT94", "B00AMSM9EK", "B00441GYRO", "B000MGBSH6", "B0003JANSW", "076780676X", "B00049QJ9I", "6305213283", "B0006HBZBK", "B0000AUHQ4", "B00005JL3W", "B000XKW2WG", "B000FZETR0", "B000E6ESI0", "B000065U1D", "B006VRRGRG", "B0002TSZHY", "B00AEFYO08", "B0000CBY1C", "B0001V1M6E", "B00507O3II", "B00005T7HZ", "B000K7VHTQ", "B00008DDXA", "B00023P4PQ", "B00JDCP0QA", "B002GHHHP6", "B00AQ59078", "6305428263", "B00009AOAY", "B0000A2ZO0", "B00G7QPUII", "B00008977G", "B00AEFY8ZE", "B0022S5B48", "B0007QJ1W0", "B0007QJ1XE", "B00AEFY0KW", "B00020HAWE", "B002Y4Z4RO", "B004CTG6TO", "B00AEBB9WI", "B00009MEKO", "B000ANVPSS", "B00KDK64DY", "B00005UWU6", "B00386EZKE", "B00008O38G", "B00005V5NS", "B000FTCLQC", "B0006J28LO", "B00008L3W3", "B0000JBALO", "B000MH0V3M", "B0018E03CW", "B0003JAOPO", "B0009PVZ9Q", "6305428034", "B000PMFRYW", "0767803434", "0790740044", "630530887X", "B000286RO8", "B00132D7XQ", "B00AEBB8OC", "B005ELVCS4", "B0000VV5BM", "B001DE29SS", "B0009X75QK", "B00HFWETZ8", "0767821556", "B000T5O47G", "B001DHXT48", "B0000648ZR", "B003ASLJIQ", "B000056VOZ", "B000M53GM2", "B00AEFXPG2", "B00GOC752E", "B00GM5U80Y"], "bought_together": ["B00AEFYRJQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AEFYRJQ", "B000FOPPC4", "B00020HAXI", "B00AEFYT1W"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 83190}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6305127700", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/414YZKWTANL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Odd Couple II"}
{"description": "Legendary director/dancer/choreographer Bob Fosse may have been a consummate entertainer, responsible for popular productions on the Broadway stage, but he was also an uncompromising filmmaker who wasn't afraid to explore the dark side of humanity. After the autobiographical intensity ofAll That Jazz, Fosse's final film was this honest and painfully authentic biography about Dorothy Stratten, who was Playboy's Playmate of the Year for 1979 and had just begun a promising film career when her jealous boyfriend took a shotgun to her head. Fosse tackles this brutal reality head on, opening the film with the aftermath of murder and telling the story in flashback, beginning in Vancouver when slick charmer Paul Snider (Eric Roberts, in a chilling performance) discovers Dorothy (Mariel Hemingway) and makes her his ticket to fame and unearned glory. He's a loser and a user, and when Dorothy rises to success and glamour at the Playboy mansion, Hugh Hefner (Cliff Robertson, perfectly cast) urges the blonde beauty to drop her troublesome boyfriend. Jealousy and rejection push Paul over the edge, butStar 80(the title is taken from Snider's vanity license plates) is no simple tale of male ego gone bad. Fosse explores the chasm between fame and obscurity, and the self-destructive lengths to which some people will go to bridge that gap. The film is a darker telling of the kind of storyBoogie Nightswould tell nearly 15 years later--both films are set in the late '70s and early '80s, and both deal with the inevitable loss of innocence in a world where innocence cannot survive. In a bleak but fascinating way,Star 80is masterful in its refusal to look away from the tragedy of its true story. It's a farewell statement from a director who clearly understood the high cost of stardom.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000AUHOE", "B00005V9HM", "B000GI3RMY", "B00LNBQ8UG", "B00B6OECIK", "B00L3ZB7JO", "B00347AINK", "B00007J5VN", "0688016111", "B00003CX8U", "B00005JN75", "B00L3ZB7PS", "B00JVQ7QTM", "B00005JO5L", "B0001AVZM6", "B00K0MM4AM", "B00K6D1S7A", "B0016LFG3S", "0553251643", "B00KSPST6Y", "B00AEFXEZE", "B0045O2PHS", "B000KP62FM", "B004XIWRW4", "B00AEFXBPM", "B003NZH84K", "B000U1ZV7Q", "B00005K3NV", "076245234X", "B000EBFLHC", "B008FYZHDS", "B0002CR036", "B008PJZDX2", "B0000C3I96", "B0030BOCMS", "B008BFSMBA", "B001CW7ZT4", "6305161933", "B00004ZBVO", "0547553293", "B001EKP5D2", "B00FFFUYCO", "B00005V9HY", "6305310335", "B00003CWN3", "B00062IVM6", "B006M3M5FM", "B000CS45H4", "B00008DDXP", "6305999872", "B00004Y87P", "B0000AZT79", "B000059TGB", "B00FMGPWD2", "0792844807", "0767809726", "B00062IVLW", "B00GRZPRB4", "B0013XZ71K", "B000059TFO", "0783500254", "B00000I6D4", "B00AY6PK5A", "B00FNR9YY8", "B00009OWJT", "B00GPPXNQ2", "B006XMK11W", "B004X63RRA", "B000Q6GUWK", "B00CQGLD9S", "B00AEFYEU8", "B001HVZOBG", "B004ULEEZC", "B00092ZLEY", "B0007W6HVM", "B00005UQ8F", "B005XB8T68", "B00GM5LL28", "B000ETRA5U", "B000TUDBFW", "B00005QJJB", "B000022TS6", "B00AEFYNG8", "B000059TFP", "0783114907", "B000ERVK94", "B00BDZV8ZM", "B00005NFZC", "B000GBEWRU", "B00009AOBI", "B00J0IN6Z4", "B00GBT637S", "B006Z7Z3VS", "B00IBKXSKA", "B000H8A9P6", "B000EQ5SRK", "B0002IQLB2"], "bought_together": ["B0000AUHOE", "B00B6OECIK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00003CX8U", "B00007J5VN", "B0000AUHOE", "B00B6OECIK"]}, "price": 51.09, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 7494}, "asin": "6305161895", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41BYCTCRMAL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Star 80"}
{"description": "Halloweenis one of the great modern horror films, but as a franchise its track record has been spotty at best, painfully bad at worst.Halloween H2O: Twenty Years Later, directed by horror vet Steve Miner (Friday the 13thparts 2 and 3,House), won't displace John Carpenter's original but it might help you forget the films in between. Miner certainly has: the film begins as if sequels 3 through 6 never happened. Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis, reprising her role for the first time in almost two decades) faked her death and is now a single mom and headmistress of an exclusive California private school. She's also a secret alcoholic who lives in fear of her homicidal brother-bogeyman Michael Myers. Guess who decides to show up for a family reunion? The film begins with classic horror-movie exposition (the deserted college campus, Michael's escape, Laurie's waking nightmares) accomplished with some humor and style, but it's all setup for the second half, a driving roller coaster of stalk-and-slash thrills. There's little of the self-conscious genre referencing ofScreamand at times the film is a little far-fetched--it is a slasher movie about a knife-wielding homicidal maniac who won't stay dead, after all--but Curtis transforms Laurie from a shrieking victim into an empowered, determined horror-movie heroine who's learned a thing or two from the previous films.

The characters are strong, the development of relationships is both ambitious and careful, the love story between Costner and Mary McDonnell's character is captivating.

{"description": "This film, which again pairs Richard Gere and Kim Basinger (who starred  in 1986'sNo  Mercy), offers up elements of classic noir: a hapless man becomes  intimately involved with a beautiful blonde who may or may  not be who or what she appears to be. Dedicated psychiatrist Isaac Barr  (Gere) reluctantly, and then more obsessively, becomes  involved with Heather Evans (Basinger), the sister of his patient, Diana  Baylor (Uma Thurman). Evans is unhappily married to a gangster  (appropriately played by a muscular and menacing Eric Roberts in a  trademark role). Gere and Basinger make a credible, if dangerous  couple, and Thurman delivers a subtle,  understated performance and demonstrates her range and potential.The thriller is appropriately shot in gorgeous San Francisco, where the  literal and figurative  curving and hilly roads wind throughout. Credit legendary art director  Dean Tavoularis for some amazing  sets and scenes, notably the elegantly cavernous restaurant where  Evans and her husband have a fateful dinner.This film is, in a way, glossy director Phil Joanou's Hitchcockian tribute--as a climactic lighthouse scene  best demonstrates.Final Analysisdoesn't offer an intimate look at its characters, but a beautifully stylized one, moody and gloomy. The intricate  plot experiments with the device of \"pathological  intoxication,\" in which the subject  completely loses control after drinking alcohol. And this doesn't mean a  conventional ugly drunk; it means  a frightening psychotic. Good and evil, hope and despair, beauty and  repulsion are often juxtaposed in the film's complex world.--N.F.

{"description": "Italy's rubber-faced funnyman Roberto Benigni accomplishes the  impossible in his World War&nbsp;II comedyLife Is Beautiful: he shapes a  simultaneously hilarious and haunting comedy out of the tragedy of the Holocaust. An international sensation and the most successful foreign language film in U.S. history, the picture also earned director-cowriter-star Benigni Oscars for Best Foreign Language Film and Best Actor. He plays the Jewish country boy Guido, a madcap romantic in Mussolini's Italy who wins the heart of his sweetheart (Benigni's real-life sweetie, Nicoletta Braschi) and raises a darling son (the adorable Giorgio Cantarini) in the shadow of fascism. When the Nazis ship the men off to a concentration camp in the waning days of the war, Guido is determined to shelter his son from the evils around them and convinces him they're in an elaborate contest to win (of all things) a tank. Guido tirelessly maintains the ruse with comic ingenuity, even as the horrors escalate and the camp's population continues to dwindle--all the more  impetus to keep his son safe, secure, and, most of all, hidden. Benigni walks a fine line mining comedy from tragedy and his efforts are pure fantasy--he accomplishes feats no man could realistically pull off--both of  which have drawn fire from a few critics. Yet for all its wacky humor and inventive gags,Life Is Beautifulis a moving and poignant tale of one father's sacrifice to save not just his young son's life but his innocence in the face of one of the most evil acts ever perpetrated by the human race.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B003JLL2RW", "B00007G25J", "B00000493Q", "6300216012", "0800100832"], "bought_together": ["B003JLL2RW"], "also_viewed": ["B0033PQUXA", "B00B0U2SEA", "B004SEUJ82", "6305291403", "0784011710", "B0010YSD7W", "B00AYXEW0C", "B000HEWEJO", "B000FVQLRA", "B0002CX1NY", "6303215734", "0783233477", "B00AEFY0F2"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 290895}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.96, "brand": "", "asin": "6305426651", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51W27JXJYQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Life Is Beautiful (La Vita E Bella) [VHS]"}
{"description": "Okay, you knew everyone in high school was just a little different: everyone looked at you strangely, the teachers were freaky, and you never could find the right groove to fit into. What if it turned out that it was all because your school was inhabited by creepy aliens from outer space? That's the enjoyably cheesy B-premise for this fun and scary flick from the pen ofScream's Kevin Williamson, the master of the post-modern teen horror film. Directed by Robert Rodriguez (El Mariachi), it'sThe Breakfast ClubmeetsInvasion of the Body Snatchers, as six disparate students from Herrington High School band together when they discover that an alien life form is invading both the student and faculty bodies, with plans to take over the world.Each of the heroes represents a different high school type: popular babe (Jordana Brewster), picked-on geek (Elijah Wood), goth girl (Clea DuVall), sensitive jock (Shawn Hatosy), new kid in town (Laura Harris), and bad-boy rebel (Josh Hartnett). The plot isn't much--a basic kill-or-be-killed premise spiked with a healthy shot of paranoia--but Willliamson and Rodriguez do a great job of building the tension slowly but surely. The suspense set pieces are genuinely frightening, and the film pokes fun at itself without deflating its scares; Williamson is a master at shifting gears from comedy to horror quickly and adroitly. The young cast doesn't have a weak link among them (with special kudos to Wood, DuVall and heartthrob-in-the-making Hartnett), and Rodriguez gets maximum mileage from the titular faculty, which includes Jon Stewart, Piper Laurie, Salma Hayek, Bebe Neuwirth, and Robert Patrick ofTerminator&nbsp;2.

{"description": "Are you wondering just exactly who the Blair Witch was? What the Burkittsville, Maryland, legend was all about? Or what exactly fascinated student filmmaker Heather and what possibly took her, Mike, and Josh from this earth? Get all your background questions answered byCurse of the Blair Witch, a one-stop-shopping \"documentary\" originally produced for the Sci-Fi Channel as a tie-in marketing tool. Entirely fictionalized,Curse of the Blair Witchfocuses both on the past and the present, with copious info on the Blair Witch myth as well as on the disappearance of Heather, Josh, and Mike. As it turns out, the original witch was one Elly Kedward, who was accused in 1785 of taking blood from several children; she was subsequently banished to the harsh winter woods and left for dead. Her grisly and bloody legacy involves missing children, polluted water, disemboweled men, and a serial killer of children who claims to have been haunted by \"an old woman ghost.\" Aside from some ineffective \"newsreel\" footage of the serial killer, all this intriguing information is presented convincingly and chillingly.Cursemay in fact freak you out more than the movie, and it evokes the great, pulpyIn Search Ofseries of the '70s, one of the prime inspirations for filmmakers Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez. News clips of the search for Heather, Josh, and Mike lend a v&eacute;rit&eacute; atmosphere to the proceedings, but shed little light on their mysterious disappearance or their characters. Basically, it's a tease to go see the movie.

{"description": "One of the most ambitious animated films to come out of Japan (or anywhere, for that matter),Perfect Blueis an adult psycho-thriller that uses the freedom of the animated image to create the subjective reality of a young actress haunted by the ghost of her past identity. Mima is a singer who leaves her teeny-bop trio to become an actress in a violent television series, a career move that angers her fans, who prefer to see her as the pert, squeaky-clean pop idol. Plagued by self-doubt and tormented by humiliating compromises, she begins to be stalked, in her waking and sleeping moments, by an accusing alter ego who claims to be \"the real Mima,\" until she collapses into madness as her coworkers are brutally slain around her. Director Satoshi Kon, adapting the novel by Yoshikazu Takeuchi, shows us the world from her schizophrenic perspective: days blur, dreams cross over into the waking world, the TV show blends into her real life, until her life merges with her part and she can't separate the ghosts from the real-life stalkers. Though the pat ending sweeps the psychosis and anxiety away with nary an emotional scar, it remains a smart, stylish thriller and one of the most intelligent and compelling uses of animation in recent years. Though tame by the extreme standards of \"adult anime,\" there is nudity and a few sexually provocative scenes, and the animation is detailed and stylized (if somewhat stiff and jerky by Disney  standards).--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["6304123523", "6304198833", "6303104371", "B00441GYS8", "6303305520", "B00005JLET", "B00002JWYZ", "B00004REO0", "1603090428", "B00000JSIK"], "also_viewed": ["B0001EFTVA", "B000VWYJ5Y", "B004DMIIPA", "B0009RQS7I", "B00ENNA62W", "B0000AK80C", "B008XEZXYI", "B0011FNDV6", "6303305520"]}, "price": 64.88, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 757563}, "asin": "6305668353", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/519PESSKE0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Perfect Blue (rated edition) [VHS]"}
{"description": "The first great period of Anthony Mann's career was the string of  blackly  brilliant late-'40s thrillers and crimebusting movies--T-Men,Raw Deal,Border  Incident, et al.--that marked the full flowering of film noir.  We won't kid  you:Railroadedwas made just before Mann hit his spectacular stride--and  just before the low-rent Producers Releasing Corporation (PRC) evolved into the somewhat more prestigious Eagle-Lion.  The rather plodding story line has  to do with a young deliveryman's framing for a robbery and the incidental  murder of a cop, and the slightly-at-cross-purposes efforts of his sister  (Sheila Ryan) and a police detective (Hugh Beaumont, better-known as \"Ward  Cleaver\") to clear him.  Much more worthy of contemplation is the saturnine John Ireland as the principal evildoer, a small-time crook whose readiness to  whack any number of people, innocent and guilty alike, gets creepier with  each passing reel.Mann hadn't yet teamed with cinematographer John Alton, and the lighting is generic--blah for the daylight scenes, merely murky for the night stuff.   Still, it's gratifying to see that Mann on his own was already reaching for the occasional deep-focus composition, outr&eacute; set piece (a shootout among  upended stools in a darkened saloon), and surprising texture--like the  close-up of a bullet hole in an alligator purse that announces a life lost,  with chilling matter-of-factness, off screen and between scenes.--Richard&nbsp;T.

{"description": "This epic 10-hour miniseries from the Emmy-winning writer ofGulliver's Travelswas a ratings bust on television, but on video and DVD, where it can be enjoyed at one's leisure, it has a better chance to cast its magical spell. Kimberly Williams has never been more enchanting than as Virginia, a waitress who still lives with her janitor father (John Larroquette) and yearns for something exciting to happen to her. Her wish comes true when she and her father are transported from New York City into a dimension that, with apologies to Rod Serling, can only be called the Fairy Tale Zone; nine kingdoms populated by characters from fairy tales of yore. They team up with a dog who's really a prince--Wendell, grandson of Snow White--changed into canine form by the evil Queen (Dianne Wiest), who plots to usurp Wendell's throne. Father, daughter, and his royal dogness are relentlessly pursued through the nine kingdoms by the Troll King (Ed O'Neill) and his three bumbling and horrible children, and the conflicted Wolf (Scott Cohen), who is allied with the Queen but, with the aid of some Oprah-esque self-help books, tames his inner beast and falls in love with Virginia.The 10th Kingdomis a special effects extravaganza. There is indeed, as one character marvels, magic to behold here. But despite the Hallmark brand name and the presence of a grown-up Snow White (Camryn Manheim) and Cinderella (Ann-Margret), bewitched animals, magic mirrors, and trolls, this is not kid's stuff. It can get scary, surprisingly violent, and quite intense; you know, just like real fairy tales.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"bought_together": ["B00B04NIZO"], "also_viewed": ["B00B04NIZO", "1575665379", "B00HZMZ2HM", "B00005AW83", "B00BUWD7WA", "B0031DDG9A", "B00BEZTMFY", "B00JPS6A3O"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 362662}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 13.97, "brand": "", "asin": "6305818282", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51C9G8D1BCL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The 10th Kingdom [VHS]"}

{"description": "Pixar genius reigns in this funny romantic comedy, which stars a robot who says absolutely nothing for a full 25 minutes yet somehow completely transfixes and endears himself to the audience within the first few minutes of the film. As the last robot left on earth, Wall-E (voiced by Ben Burtt) is one small robot--with a big, big heart--who holds the future of earth and mankind squarely in the palm of his metal hand. He's outlasted all the \"Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class\" robots that were assigned some 700 years ago to clean up the environmental mess that man made of earth while man vacationed aboard the luxury spaceship Axiom. Wall-E has dutifully gone about his job compacting trash, the extreme solitude broken only by his pet cockroach, but he's developed some oddly human habits and ideas. When the Axiom sends its regularly scheduled robotic EVE probe (Elissa Knight) to earth, Wall-E is instantly smitten and proceeds to try to impress EVE with his collection of human memorabilia. EVE's directive compels her to bring Wall-E's newly collected plant sprout to the captain of the Axiom and Wall-E follows in hot pursuit. Suddenly, the human world is turned upside down and the Captain (Jeff Garlin) joins forces with Wall-E and a cast of other misfit robots to lead the now lethargic people back home to earth. Wall-E is a great family film with the most impressive aspect being the depth of emotion conveyed by a simple robot--a machine typically considered devoid of emotion, but made so absolutely touching by the magic of Pixar animation. Also well-worth admiring are the sweeping views from space, the creative yet disturbing vision of what strange luxuries a future space vacation might offer, and the innovative use of trash in a future cityscape. Underneath the slapstick comedy and touching love story is a poignant message about the folly of human greed and its potential effects on earth and the entire human race.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000VBJEEG", "B001KVZ6FW", "B00007LVCM", "B00BG0RSJ4", "B00AFEX83C", "0736424229", "B00005JN4W", "B00005JNQS", "B0042U94UQ", "B00E9ZATJO", "B001OMU6UM", "B00005JNS0", "B0030IIZ4M", "B0034JKZ86", "B002ZG97YM", "B002WJI2QQ", "B004HO6I4M", "B008YWY0HK", "B0012EM5D8", "B0006UEVT0", "B009SZCC9U", "B004G600A4", "B00AAXFYPI", "B00F522C7C", "B008Z1LBU4", "B00CTNYLQA", "B003H9M1Q2", "B000AAF1TU", "B008JFUQ16", "B000ROAK2W", "B000AY74OG", "B00275EHJG", "B00CWM58WY", "B00009M9BK", "B00EV1YZ96", "B001DPHDCY", "B000MV9026", "B001O5LVPI", "0783231474", "B00CQRN3QI", "B00G5G7EXY", "B00I6JOD2S", "B001HN6922", "B00GDT5T9Y", "B0087F7VSY", "B001U2MQE0", "B0030IIYYS", "B00A83075M", "B00H4Z07Q6", "B005LAIH4A", "B000DWMYQ8", "B00CHVJODE", "B0000AOX0O", "B003UESJF6", "B00JK531ES", "B00HLTD2OE", "B0001I561E", "B00BGYO7HG", "B003ZHVJGO", "B001ILFUD2", "B0002YLCOM", "B0039N74CW", "B00004U9WQ", "B00937R6QC", "B00CUDD0C0", "B004EPZ034", "B00004R99S", "B00003CXB4", "B000065V42", "B00005RDSQ", "B004ZBACOE", "B001GCUO7A", "B00AO686JC", "B000AAF1U4", "B0006JMLRK", "B00005JMQZ", "B0043X1FOK", "B00C7JGDBW", "B001JRB17Y", "B001KVZ6G6", "B00005TN8K", "B00005JMFH", "B00E9ZATKI", "B001ILFUDC", "B000V1Y44G", "B00003CX8Y", "B0011U52E2", "B00EBBGLFC", "B000YERP2S", "B00009YXAW", "B00003CXCQ", "B002NZK5SW", "B000G75AZC", "B00CNW9ZI6", "B0084IHVGG", "B00947N6D8", "B004LWZW7Y"], "bought_together": ["B001KVZ6FW", "B000VBJEEG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004HO6I4M", "B001KVZ6FW", "B00I6JOD2S", "B00005JN4W"]}, "price": 17.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 319062}, "asin": "7883706837", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51u-jDIxUZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)"}

{"description": "This charming British animated short film (it's just 23 minutes long) is a 1982 production of London's Channel 4, based on the classic children's book by Raymond Briggs and crafted with a colored-pencils-on-paper look, like fluffy, hand-drawn illustrations. Small children should be entranced by the story of a small boy in rural England whose lovingly constructed snowman comes to life and takes him flying over the white-blanketed landscapes, in a beautiful rotoscoped (traced) sequence based on live-action flying footage. Part of the charm of the film is the gentle, everyday quality of its fantasy adventures: the snowman is invited in to try on clothes and play with the Christmas decorations, then plays host to the boy at a party in the woods, at which his snowy relatives do English country dances. This is one of the very few Christmas tapes on the market that really deserves to be a holiday perennial, a gentle fable of friendship and the power of imagination.--David Chute", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00DOZRT0W", "6305042772", "B0000277CK", "0394839730"], "bought_together": ["B00DOZRT0W", "0394839730"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 273059}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.94, "brand": "", "asin": "B0000048V8", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/414YP94HVWL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Snowman [VHS]"}

Bill is a struggling writer who fills his time and mind by following random strangers he sees on the street. After breaking his own rule (\"never follow the same person twice\") he becomes fascinated by Cobb, a voyeur who takes things one step further--actually breaking into people's homes to sift through their things. As you might expect, the relationship soon becomes unhealthy. Writer-director Christopher Nolan already reveals a sure hand in this early neo-noir work.

Add a few gruesome dismemberments, Betty White as a cantankerous old broad who may have murdered her husband, and a cow hanging from a helicopter, and there you have it:Lake Placid.

Sutherland is yanked from his school-teaching job back East and extradited for trial, until he's liberated by the other members of the gang. There's a memorable scrap between Phillips and Slater, and a couple of pretty decent firefights, but all in all this is rather forgettable fare. It taps into the futility and camaraderie of classics likeThe Wild BunchandButch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, but Sam Peckinpah or George Roy Hill it ain't. Jon Bon Jovi adds to the Rock-Stars-in-the-Old-West feel of this one, rife as it is with non-period dialogue and long, blowy hair.

{"description": "As the triumphant start of a trilogy,The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ringleaves you begging for more. By necessity, Peter  Jackson's ambitious epic compresses J.R.R. Tolkien's classicThe Lord of the Rings,  but this robust adaptation maintains reverent allegiance to Tolkien's creation,  instantly qualifying as one of the greatest fantasy films ever made. At 178  minutes, it's long enough to establish the myriad inhabitants of Middle-earth,  the legendary Rings of Power, and the fellowship of hobbits, elves, dwarves, and  humans--led by the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and the brave hobbit Frodo  (Elijah Wood)--who must battle terrifying forces of evil on their perilous  journey to destroy the One Ring in the land of Mordor. Superbly paced, the film  is both epic and intimate, offering astonishing special effects and production  design while emphasizing the emotional intensity of Frodo's adventure. Ending on  a perfect note of heroic loyalty and rich anticipation, this wondrous fantasy  continues inThe Two Towers(2002).--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JKZV", "B00005JKZY", "B00BEZTMFY", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B005COPWZW", "B00005JM5E", "B002ZG980U", "B002PMV9FG", "B001GZ6QC4", "B007K3JFUQ", "B000U7WV1Y", "B00005JNJV", "B001OQCV6A", "B004M1A21K", "B008UZ7MYY", "B00HFFE8HE", "B000A9QKLO", "B000E8M0VA", "B000W7F5SS", "B0014C2FX8", "0618640150", "B001DHXT20", "B00E5I2M6I", "B00003CX5P", "B0013FDM7E", "B00AZMFJYA", "B00005QZWI", "B0019L770A", "B000I0RQVI", "B002IPFWTE", "B001CDR1FG", "B0006UEVT0", "B003TT2X6S", "B001OQCV2E", "B009JBWOU0", "B00005JL78", "B00005JNOG", "B001UV4XHY", "B00CNW9ZI6", "B00GKOJ98E", "0345325818", "B0014Z4ON4", "B000H30B2C", "B005LXQLRW", "B001UV4XIS", "B001GCUO1Q", "B00CZDLGDU", "0345538374", "B004LWZW42", "B007REV4T8", "B000W746GK", "B00005JPH2", "B003TT2X72", "B004LWZWGA", "B0087ZG7J8", "B005G4TJUC", "B003ZK99NQ", "B00006HBUJ", "B008UZA8FY", "B0090SI56Y", "B000VI70QS", "B00005JNC2", "B004WCTLNY", "B0014Z4OMU", "6305313687", "B004AKCME8", "B000E6EK2Y", "0547928211", "B000LC55F2", "B0002KVUKM", "B000FQJAIW", "B008JFUO72", "B000FIMG68", "B005LAIHSG", "B005LAIIT4", "B004AOECXI", "B00029RTCG", "B000P0J0EM", "B002HWRYJE", "B0060FXDCG", "B001ECQ75A", "0792839749", "B00AEFXZJE", "B005LAII0I", "B0042U94UQ", "B001HN6918", "B00008G8M5", "B008JFURII", "B003ZKBELG", "B000P0J09W", "B003XURDAY", "B00335EQ0E", "B00008G8M4", "0547928203", "B000W796OM", "B00006ADD5", "B00J49R1BY", "B00B04NIZO", "B00G5G7EXY", "B00001ZWUS"], "bought_together": ["B00005JKZV", "B00005JKZY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00HFFE8HE", "B00005JKZY", "B00BEZTMFY", "B00005JKZV"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 3641}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.49, "brand": "NEW Line Home Video", "asin": "B00003CWT6", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Dj%2BQ1hLBL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)"}
{"description": "A confident hybrid ofM*A*S*H,Treasure of the Sierra Madre, andDr. Strangelove,Three Kingsis one of the most seriously funny war movies ever made. Improving the premise ofKelly's Heroeswith scathing intelligence, it explores the odd connection between war and consumerism in the age of Humvees and cellular phones. Writer-director David O.&nbsp;Russell's third film (afterSpanking the MonkeyandFlirting with Disaster), it's a no-holds-barred portrait of personal conscience in the volatile arena of politics, played out by one of the most gifted filmmakers to emerge in the 1990s.George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg, Ice Cube, and Spike Jonze (director ofBeing John Malkovich) play a quartet of U.S.&nbsp;soldiers who, disillusioned by Operation Desert Storm, decide to steal $23&nbsp;million in gold hijacked from Kuwait by Saddam Hussein's army. Getting the bullion out of an Iraqi stronghold is easy; keeping it is a potentially lethal proposition. By the end of their mercenary mission, the Americans can no longer ignore wartime atrocities (and neither can we--the film is boldly unflinching), and conscience demands their aid to Kuwaiti rebels abandoned by President George Bush's fickle wartime policy. This is serious stuff indeed, but Russell infusesThree Kingswith a keen sense of the absurd, and the entire film is an exercise in breathtaking visual ingenuity. Despite a conventional ending that's mildly disappointing for such a brashly original film,Three Kingsconveys the brutal madness of war while making you laugh out loud at the insanity.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B00DON8NJ0", "B000IYV1ME", "B000O7667K", "B000H1RFKU", "B003ASLJOK", "B000JU7KAE", "B001G8XOMG", "B00DON4TPC", "B001O7JHSO", "B0046BHC6O", "B0021L8URQ", "B001XURJCS", "B001CT877G", "B0013FSXT6", "B002ZG97QU", "B0047BXR1W", "B001HN69CC", "B000JLPMPI", "B000HLDFK4", "B000TGGJKU", "B003L7DK60", "B001AQT0RC", "B001J6NZGU", "B0011VIODW", "B000Q7ZND6", "B000P6XU60", "B000H1RFKK", "B001FB55M6", "B0017TYPIG", "B000O176IO", "B0011E5D2Y", "B000KF0NI4", "B000Q6GX90", "B000LPS4BG", "B000M5AJQI", "B000JUB7LW", "B0015GDVTU", "B000UJ48UO", "B002Z7FM68", "B000I5XOWI", "B000MEYFXW", "B0012YYZYK", "B000PC0U1W", "B003YOZNBK", "B001NCDCQ8", "B000JLSLZQ", "B000R3PDK2", "B001FB55H6", "B0010HOZXA", "B003B1X80Y", "B000JLSM00", "B001O7JHW0", "B006H3MIYA", "B000MQ54OY", "B003UESJHY", "B000Q66J1M", "B006OQ0K0E", "B003TT2X6S", "B001OQCUZW", "B003TT2X6I"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B006H3MIYA", "B002T9H2L0", "B003KGBIS4", "B00HF98SY4"]}, "price": 8.5, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 1098395}, "asin": "B00003CX73", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51BA5ATJSYL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Three Kings"}
{"description": "Schizoid serial killer Carl Stargher (Vincent D'Onofrio) has  been captured at last, but a neurological seizure has rendered him  comatose, and FBI agent Peter Novak (Vince Vaughan) has no way to  determine the location of Stargher's latest and still-living victim. To  probe the secrets contained in Stargher's traumatized psyche, the FBI  recruits psychologist Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez), who has  mastered a new technology that allows her to enter the mind of another person. What she finds in Stargher's head is a  theater of the grotesque, which, as envisioned by first-time director  Tarsem Singh, is a smorgasbord of the surreal that borrows liberally  from the Brothers Quay, Czech animator Jan Svankmajer, Hieronymous  Bosch, Salvador Dali, and a surplus of other cannibalized sources.This provides one of the wildest, weirdest visual feasts ever committed  to film, andThe Cellearns a place among such movie mind-trips  as2001: A Space Odyssey,Altered States,What Dreams  May Come, andUn Chien Andalou. Is this a good thing? Sure,  if all you want is freakazoid eye-candy. If you're looking for emotional depth,  substantial plot, and artistic coherence,The Cellis sure to  disappoint. The pop-psychology pablum of Mark Protosevich's screenplay  would be laughable if it weren't given such somber significance, and  Singh's exploitative use of sadomasochistic imagery is repugnant (this  movie makesSevenlook tame), so you're better off marveling at  the nightmare visions that are realized with astonishing potency.The Cellis too shallow to stay in your head for long, but while  it's there, it's one hell of a show.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0026LYLTM", "B001BPJJ9G", "B003TRMLQM", "6305238065", "B00005UQ9W", "0767805763", "0783229402", "B000OYC7BW", "B008NNY8RM", "B000BMY2MO", "B0000CERP3", "B000O76ZQC", "B0045HCJSU", "B00006SFKM", "0767821629", "B000K4X5P8", "B00AEBBA2W", "B000VUFJ0K", "B00011CZRE", "B001MVYUR0", "B00009QUH4", "B000NQRR1Q", "B000TJ6PBK", "B00006HAWN", "B00009MGEM", "B00005R5GF", "B0018O4YT0", "B0001EFTTW", "B00441GYVK", "B00005NRO0", "B00000I1KK", "0783237413", "B00003CXKA", "B000063US5", "B00005ATQB", "B00441GYXI", "B002OVB9YE", "B00BTYNXJG", "B00000JSJC", "6305718954", "B0012680CQ", "B001JNNDJM", "B000GCFO0I", "B0037XPP8Y", "B00K57K2JM", "B004EPYZU8", "B00008EY9G", "B0000AC8LR", "B00AEFXW8I", "B00003CXXP", "B004SEUJOQ", "B001R3YRG2", "B00013RC7K", "B0000AVHCD", "6305313687", "B0016BO72O", "B00DW5IKYS", "B00005JOWW", "B00006FDCD", "B00003CXPS", "B007I1Q54O", "B00005JMWP", "B0009G3B0G", "B0006GAOMW", "B0007Y08QA", "B004P7CN7W", "B00005N5RM", "B00005JLWN", "B002VRNIZO", "B0001Z52RU", "B00005Q4CS", "B000069I1I", "B008HUSFXO", "B00AJXO56I", "B00BLN4UPG", "B0009X75J2", "B00006JDU8", "B003VA3JUO", "B00005JKLZ", "B000053UIF", "B00005V1WW", "0783229526", "B002KLQ2ZO", "0780622650", "B005FUTBWS", "B0006L0LOS", "0780627849", "0783240295", "B000LP6KNU", "B000U7169M", "B000RGN2JI", "B000GI3KGC", "B00003CY6P", "0767824954", "B0009A40ES", "B0002CX22E", "B0057ZAA6W", "B00005UQ9I", "B00003CWRF", "B00005N7Z1"], "bought_together": ["B0026LYLTM"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001BPJJ9G", "B003TRMLQM", "B005CFBYW6", "B000A343RI"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 25555}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 10.99, "brand": "New Line Studios", "asin": "B00003CXKM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51%2BF5HiVvcL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Cell (New Line Platinum Series)"}

Kirsten Dunst stars as Torrance Shipman, the ditzy but loveable high school senior who is newly elected team captain of her high school cheerleading team. But when a replacement cheerleader, Missy Pantone, walks in to the Toros' cheerleading squad (hilariously portrayed by Eliza Dushku), she shows Torrance that the team's cheers are ripped off from the East Compton Clovers, and you can believe that the Clovers are fed up with the stealing. Torrance, horrified that her cheerleading career has been a fake, makes an effort to be original, but the result is a humiliating performance at a competition. Torrance is comforted by love interest Cliff Pantone (played by hottie Jesse Bradford), Missy's REALLY cute twin brother, and a romance begins. As the movie leads up to the UCA Nationals competition, the Clovers and Toros fight for the win. Who will it be? Well you better watch it for yourself. Bring It On is a refreshing change from the immature sick sex movies and it instead is fresh, bright, witty, and very funny.

When he fires Yzma (Eartha Kitt), his evil sorceress, she seeks revenge and turns Kuzco into a llama with the help of her hunk of the month, a lunk named Kronk (Patrick Warburton). Alone in the jungle, the talking llama is befriended by Pacha (John Goodman), who has just been told to vacate his pastoral home by the human Kuzco. What's an ego to do? That's pretty much the story and the characters--simple, direct, fun--a Disney film on a diet. For any fan of the acidic humor of Spade, this is essential viewing. As narrator of his tale, Kuzco uses a sarcastic tone to keep the story jumping with plenty of fun asides (he even \"stops\" the film at one point to make sure you know the story is abouthim). Even better is character actor Warburton (Elaine's stuck-up boyfriend onSeinfeld), who steals every scene as the dim-witted, but oh-so-likable Kronk. There's even a delicious Tom Jones number that starts the film off with a bang.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["0788805843", "6305229449", "B00005JKDQ", "B00005JL95", "B00005RDVV", "6302526574", "B000035Z2S", "0788812408", "B0000AQZYM", "6300275310", "6304290888", "6304401132", "6303314015", "0788802194", "6302787068", "6304089767", "6303983812", "6304500831", "B00003CX7L", "6303534422", "6302642248", "B00003CXHR", "B00005JLR1", "0788805533", "B00016JF2W", "078881172X", "6302178924", "6304978286", "0788812807", "6305326940", "6305319138", "6300274268", "6302961572", "6304100507", "155890641X", "0788806270", "0788803743", "6305940932", "6302320402", "B00004R99N", "6300274195", "6303929338", "B00003CWPW", "B00003CXXI", "6302426200", "B0000E32WB", "B00003CXG6", "B00005T7H6", "6304400551", "B00005JKX3", "6304501153", "6304089201", "0788812440", "6301991311", "0788811002", "6303036813", "B000JBWWRO", "B000B8QFYG", "6300274608", "6302158095", "B0000524CZ", "B000035Z46", "6303122647", "6305318867", "6304155972", "B00000ICHA", "B0002YLCHE", "6304401736", "0783236689", "B00004R996", "6304416415", "6304176996", "1558906150", "B0007Z9R0M", "B00006CXK5", "B00005JMQY", "0788809806", "B00006IUM9", "B00004R99A", "B00029LO18", "6304873441", "B000028U3S", "6304400225", "B0007A2GSM", "6301948106", "6301390725", "B00003CWPX", "6303929567", "6302968143", "B00004R99I", "6303232221", "078880720X", "6304434340", "B00003CXG7", "6305177473", "0788812181", "B00003CXQ6", "B000009CTR", "B000DWMYQ8"], "bought_together": ["0788805843", "6305229449"], "also_viewed": ["0788805843", "B00005JKDQ", "6304089767", "155890641X", "6303314015", "078881172X", "6302787068", "6302526574", "0788805533", "6305326940", "0788812408", "B00005JL95", "0788802194", "0788806270", "B0000AQZYM", "6302320402", "6302642248", "6303929338", "6304500831", "6303534422", "B00003CX7L", "6305229449", "6304401132", "B00005RDVV", "0788812807", "6304400551", "6304290888", "6300275310", "B000035Z2S", "6305940932", "6303983812", "B00003CXHR", "6304089201", "B00016JF2W", "6303036813", "B00006CXK5", "6302158095", "B0007KTBIU", "6300274268", "6305319138", "B00003CXG6", "B000035Z46", "6302178924", "6300274195", "B00005JLR1", "B0000E32WB", "6303122647", "6302961572", "6304100507", "B00005JKX3", "6301991311", "6304978286", "B00003CXXI", "B0000524CZ", "6303939015", "6304501153", "6302426200", "B00005T7H6", "B00004R99N"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 169967}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.39, "brand": "", "asin": "B00003CXQX", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51CARZ3R0XL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Emperor's New Groove [VHS]"}

{"description": "Set in 1797 at the beginning of the Napoleonic Wars,Damn the Defiant!(also known asH.M.S. Defiant) is an enthralling British naval drama made to capitalize on MGM's epic remake ofMutiny on the Bounty, also released in 1962. It's based on Frank Tilsey's novelMutinyand stars Alex Guinness as a fair-minded captain locked in psychological conflict with his manipulative, coldly malicious first officer (Dirk Bogarde), and the parallels with the famous true story are clear. However, there were many naval mutinies during this period, and this large-scale saga, which includes some spectacularly staged widescreen naval battles, offers a realistic depiction of life in the British navy at the time--from the press gangs and floggings to the appalling food and living conditions.Director Lewis Gilbert--who previously helmedSink the Bismarck!(1960)--strikes a good balance between the personal drama and sweeping maritime adventure. Guinness successfully varies his firm-but-fair officer fromThe Bridge on the River Kwai, Bogarde is chillingly hateful, and Anthony Quayle gives strong support.--Gary S.

{"description": "Frank Sinatra stars with Kim Novak and Eleanor Parker in this riveting drama about a poker dealer/jazz musician who descends to skid row after becoming addicted to heroin. Will he make it back into the spotlight&#x97;or even survive? Based upon the classic American novel by Nelson Algren, The Man with the Golden Arm was far ahead of its time with its depiction of what drugs can do to even an ambitious person. Its cautionary tale still holds up today as heroin has come back to haunt not only the inner city but middle America as well. It contains what Frank Sinatra himself considered his best performance, a role which gained him an Oscar nomination for Best Actor of 1955. Directed by the notorious Otto Preminger, this hard-edged, expressionistic view of the normally-depicted-as-glorious 1950s will come as a fascinating surprise to those who have yet to discover this classic melodrama. Co-starring a young Darren McGavin in his debut film performance, it also contains one of movie score legend Elmer Bernstein&#x92;s best compositions which earned one of the film&#x92;s two other Oscar nominations, along with one for art direction. Includes Original Theatrical Trailer: Approx. 2 min. Film: Approx. 119 min.Bonus Material:  At The Movies With Frank Sinatra Enjoy exclusive and revealing interviews with Hollywood legends Henry Silva (Manchurian Candidate), Beverly Garland (The Joker Is Wild), Ernest Borgnine (From Here To Eternity), and Joey Bishop (Ocean&#x92;s 11). Along with these rare and insightful interviews from the stars are the original coming attraction trailers from these classic moments of cinema magic. Special bonus material includes a revealing backstage look at the making of The Man With The Golden Arm. Sinatra himself is seen in a rare and candid interview. Composer Elmer Bernstein talks about scoring the film, and discusses Sinatra&#x92;s artistic contributions. Star Tommy Sands relates classic moments of what it was like working with Sinatra, and historian Rick Ross talks about the impact of Frank&#x92;s performance in this classic contribution to the annals of Hollywood Cinema.

{"description": "Like the movie itself, there's little in the supplementary materials forThe Patriotthat requires more than one viewing, but they're interesting while they last. \"The Art of War\" featurette purports to be a study of the film's elaborate battle logistics, but it offers only a cursory appreciation of sequence planning and stunt work. The \"True Patriots\" featurette is much better, examining the painstaking efforts toward authenticity in production design, artillery, and costuming. The visual effects featurette offers a study of several pivotal shots, displayed in triptych fashion (to show how effects are layered together from separate elements) and narrated by visual effects supervisor Stuart Robertson. Generous photo galleries are included, featuring shots of the primary cast, sets, and costumes (the last matched by a gallery of conceptual drawings), and the feature-length commentary by director Roland Emmerich and producer Dean Devlin is worthwhile, if not altogether essential.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEFXKUI", "B00AMSLDTM", "B00AEBBA36", "B00AEFY5B6", "B00001ZWUS", "0800177967", "B000A2WP7O", "B00008G8M4", "B00003CXTG", "B004AOECXI", "B002O3Z510", "B000065U1N", "B00005221M", "B00000G3PA", "B00AEFY0F2", "B000E5N6LG", "B002O3Z50Q", "B0001HLVS2", "079284646X", "B00003CXA6", "B008MIMWOY", "6304711905", "0783225733", "B002VWNID6", "B0002WZTOI", "B000P0J0EW", "B00009OOFA", "B000NOKFHQ", "0783231202", "B000P0J0EM", "B003U0AHBO", "B004SIP7TE", "B00003CXQA", "B0000TANUI", "0792839137", "B00011CZRE", "B00005B6JZ", "B0002DRDBY", "B00AEFXRRO", "B002AS464Q", "B000WGWQG8", "B00026L9CU", "B00005JN5E", "B00007GZYC", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00005ATZT", "B000067D1R", "B000U1ZV8K", "B00B0U2SFE", "B003AWRMCE", "6304806434", "B00AEBB932", "B00005JM6F", "B00005JL3T", "B002ZG997C", "B00AEFXVCU", "B000FI8MPW", "B000VKL6ZM", "B00319ECI8", "B005LAIGYQ", "B0045HCJT4", "B0008JIJ2O", "B002O3Z50G", "B00AZNEW5G", "B00008AOTO", "B000LP6KNU", "0783227973", "B002VWNIBI", "B004FQX5B6", "B00AEBB9WI", "B004IK30M8", "B004IK30MI", "B0007PALM0", "B00AEBBA0E", "B001TK80D4", "B000O77SRC", "B004SIP7ZS", "B000095WW8", "079283366X", "6305558167", "B00AEFXKOO", "B0007TKNM4", "B0002YLCG0", "B00003CXHJ", "B000MZHW40", "B000F48D4G", "B001BNFRB2", "B00AEFXYJA", "B000QXDED6", "0767817710", "B0004Z33EG", "B00005JN0W", "B003ASLJRC", "B00HEPE6MM", "0790729695", "B000FVQLRA", "B00004WG2F", "B008MIMWQW", "B000GG4Y32", "B0068FZ0O2"], "bought_together": ["B00001ZWUS", "B00AEBBA36"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00001ZWUS", "B00AEFY5B6", "B004AOECXI", "B000NOKFHQ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 2823}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.0, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B00004XPPG", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51NDFXHAW9L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Patriot (Special Edition)"}

{"description": "Adventure movies are hard to come by these days--they've been replaced by action movies, which favor fast cars and big explosions over the dangers of nature and explorations of human character.Breakheart Passstars Charles Bronson as a mysterious petty criminal on the Western frontier. After being caught cheating at cards, he's arrested and held on a military transport train heading through the Rocky Mountains toward a fort on the coast, a fort stricken with diphtheria and in desperate need of the medical supplies on the train. But there's a conspiracy afoot--people on the train keep getting killed or disappearing--and the situation at the fort isn't what it seems either. Alistair MacLean adapted the screenplay from his own novel, and it's a well-plotted, efficient piece of work, made more compelling by a cast of solid character actors, ranging from Charles Durning (The Sting,Tootsie), Richard Crenna (Body Heat), and Ben Johnson (Oscar winner forThe Last Picture Show) to guys whose faces you'll recognize, even if their names don't sound familiar.Breakheart Passisn'tThe Treasure of the Sierra Madre, and Bronson isn't Humphrey Bogart, but the movie is a lean adventure flick with an outstanding score by Jerry Goldsmith.

{"description": "It's a mixed blessing, butFrank Herbert's Dunegoes a long way toward satisfying science fiction purists who scoffed at David Lynch's previous attempt to adapt Herbert's epic narrative. Ironically, director John Harrison's 288-minute TV miniseries (broadcast on the Sci-Fi Channel in December 2000) offers its own share of strengths and weaknesses, which, in retrospect, emphasize the quality of Lynch's film while treating Herbert's novel with more comprehensive authority. Debate will continue as to which film is better; Lynch's extensive use of internal monologue now seems like a challenge well met, and Harrison's more conventional approach is better equipped to convey the epic scope of Herbert's interplanetary political intrigue.This much is certain: thisDuneis a sumptuous treat for the eyes, with sets and costumes that were conceived with no apparent limits of budget or creativity. In terms of architecture alone, this is one of the most impressive films in science fiction history. And although the special effects fall short of feature-film quality, writer-director Harrison (who rose from an extensive background in TV) admirably tames the sprawling narrative that pits the opposing houses of Atreides and Harkonnen in a struggle to control the lucrative market for the spice melange. This is as accurate as anyDuneadaptation is likely to get (i.e., there's no need for another attempt), and even then, it can be tricky to keep track of who's doing what to whom. Unfortunately, the film's biggest flaws are the casting of a nearly comatose William Hurt as Duke Leto, and a wooden Alec Newman as the messiah-to-be, Paul Atreides. These are regrettable shortcomings, but thisDuneremains altogether respectable. That Frank Herbert would be impressed is perhaps the biggest compliment one can pay.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"bought_together": ["B00008RUYH"], "also_viewed": ["B00008RUYH", "6300183971", "B00371QQ0M", "B008R65XN8", "B00008V61T"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 403297}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 5.82, "brand": "", "asin": "B000053V8F", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41DS5D1W96L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Frank Herbert's Dune (TV Miniseries) [VHS]"}

{"description": "Director Frank Darabont created this Frank Capra-inspired drama based on a screenplay by his friend and one-time schoolmate Michael Sloane. Jim Carrey stars as Pete Appleton, a screenwriter in the Hollywood of the 1950s. Pete's on top of the world with his first motion picture \"Sand Pirates of the Sahara\" just released to theaters and his romance with a beautiful starlet (Amanda Detmer) heating up. However, his triumph turns to dismay when he's called before the commie-hunting House Un-American Activities Committee and advised by a studio lawyer and his agent to play ball with the witch hunters. Depressed by the film industry's weak-kneed reaction to the hearings, Pete gets drunk and drives his car north along the California coast, where he crashes from a bridge and wakes up on shore the next morning suffering from amnesia. Wandering into the nearby small town of Lawson, Pete is mistaken for Luke Trimble, a lost hero of World War II who, like most of the area's young men, never returned from the war a decade earlier. \"Luke\" has soon reunited with both his father (Martin Landau) and his one-time girlfriend (Laurie Holden), and finds that his reappearance has given the citizens of Lawson an emotional boost that's sorely needed. When he refurbishes and reopens his family's decrepit movie theater, the Majestic, Luke revitalizes Lawson just as his memory of his true identity begins to reassert itself. Sloane's original script for The Majestic (2001) was entitled The Bijou.", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 298103}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.75, "brand": "", "asin": "B00005JKNB", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GZ710HSNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Majestic [VHS]"}

{"description": "Gosford Parkfinds director Robert Altman in sumptuously fine form indeed. From the opening shots, as the camera peers through the trees at an opulent English country estate, Altman exploits the 1930s period setting and whodunit formula of the film expertly. Aristocrats gather together for a weekend shooting party with their dutiful servants in tow, and the upstairs/downstairs division of the classes is perfectly tailored to Altman's method (as employed inNashvilleandShort Cuts) of overlapping bits of dialogue and numerous subplots in order to betray underlying motives and the sins that propel them. Greed, vengeance, snobbery, and lust stir comic unrest as the near dizzying effect of brisk script turns is allayed by perhaps Altman's strongest ensemble to date. First and foremost, Maggie Smith is marvelous as Constance, a dependent countess with a quip for every occasion; Michael Gambon, as the ill-fated host, Sir William McCordle, is one of the most palpably salacious characters ever on screen; Kristin Scott Thomas is perfectly cold yet sexy as Lady Sylvia, Sir William's wife; and Helen Mirren, Emily Watson, and Clive Owen are equally memorable as key characters from the bustling servants' quarters below.Gosford Parkmanages to be fabulously entertaining while exposing human shortcomings, compromises, and our endless need for confession.--Fionn Meade", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000BITVAG", "B007A2O3FO", "B00003CXC9", "B005S9EJ14", "B0000CE684", "B00AZMFO6I", "B0080QOL10", "630560097X", "B000LPS34E", "B000E8JNQU", "B004ALIG2O", "B00005UNCB", "B004JMSIQS", "6305692696", "B00F1BFRA6", "B002TZS58I", "B0002DRDY6", "B004SIP7D0", "B000E0ODZE", "B0001US78G", "B004XVMCMQ", "B004XYOQU4", "1557045313", "B005SYZYYK", "B000F3UAFC", "B000063K2Q", "B00003CX8N", "B0009GX1CE", "B001KP2J3U", "B0006Z2NAY", "B008NNY8TK", "B00062IZ0Y", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B005CFBZX4", "B004U7MQZ6", "B0001I55M4", "B00005O7N8", "0788815490", "B00GSBMNOQ", "B003UESJH4", "B0001DCYUU", "B0000797E7", "B008RO6PJQ", "B0013K2ZGI", "B000ETRCN0", "B00005OBAL", "B0009PVZM8", "6305918880", "B0080QOKYS", "B00HUAH14Q", "B00009IB1D", "B000A8AXXG", "B00GWXI16O", "B00C888OFA", "B00GAXASLC", "1250020360", "B000N4SHOE", "B004H0ZHD4", "B0099Y2MYK", "B009B1EPQ4", "B001CW7ZT4", "1573629723", "B009T6CXG0", "B001GJ4U5A", "B004SIP98S", "B00G15MDI0", "B00B62R9XM", "B004SIP9U6", "B0080QOL1A", "B000069HZU", "B004N66XYE", "B004XVMCKS", "1250047900", "B004499LWG", "B00AY2DL78", "6305428557", "B00A1EOC22", "B00D49YEHO", "B00BTYJYR6", "B0001US61O", "B0006Q9482", "B007701RFS", "B0073U2EWM", "B00F98FOI6", "B000092T3P", "B000CCW2O8", "B000065V3V", "B004HHX9H8", "B00HYZ0ZLS", "B00JFH8GZA", "B003DUBAXK", "B00AEFYO5I", "B00005U2KC", "B004SIP7F8", "B00GAHJO8G", "B00005RDRO", "B00DW5IKWK", "B00D3PYQT0", "B00005JOA0"], "bought_together": ["B000BITVAG", "B005S9EJ14"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AZMFO6I", "B000BITVAG", "630560097X", "B00005UNCB"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 7477}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 10.27, "brand": "Universal Studios", "asin": "B00005JKNF", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51oleUlbquL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Gosford Park - Collector's Edition"}

And if you want info about the movie, you can get that, too: a commentary track by director Sam Raimi, actor Kirsten Dunst, producer Laura Ziskin, and co-producer Grant Curtis, plus a technically oriented commentary by the effects crew; pop-up factoids offering trivia about the movie and comic book; occasional Easter eggs leading to featurettes (e.g., 90 seconds on wrestler Randy Savage as Bonesaw McGraw); and promotional documentaries, screen tests, outtakes, and the like.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JMQW", "B000UR9T8C", "B004LWZWFQ", "B001DHXT20", "B00E5I2MCM", "B00005JNTU", "B001GCUO1Q", "B00005JNJV", "B000AYELVA", "B001CDR1FG", "B000VI70QS", "B0000959N0", "B000AYELVU", "B002GSXKN8", "B00E5I2MEK", "B0002IQMAM", "B0083SBMBM", "B001GZ6QC4", "B008JFUO72", "B00E5I2M6I", "B004LWZW42", "B004EPZ07K", "B0090SI56Y", "B00E5I2M9K", "B008QZ5PY2", "B00JPS7HOA", "B0007P0Y7C", "B000IJ79UW", "B000HCO83Q", "B001QB9H1U", "B000VR0570", "B000HEVZ9E", "B000OVLBF8", "B008JFUS0U", "B008JFUPFI", "B0000VCZLG", "B002A5EBLW", "B000I0RQVI", "B002ZG99B8", "B005G4TJUC", "B002IPFWTE", "B00005JM5E", "B001DJLD2G", "B000J10EQU", "6307397594", "B004LWZWGA", "B00006II6Q", "B000ARXF96", "B000P0J06K", "B00177YA1K", "B00004STUL", "B001OST0M6", "B0049IHX2C", "B0006L0LOS", "B00IGVJGYQ", "0767817478", "B008Y1YK9Y", "B000PGINMQ", "B0025AY3X8", "B002HWRYJE", "B002GSXKNI", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B000GFLKF8", "B00007G205", "B0002KVUKM", "B0060FXDCG", "B007K3JFUQ", "B00005N5S5", "B00000F4ZY", "B001GKJ2E8", "B006VRRGNK", "B00003CXTA", "B0007RT9MG", "B001VLBDD0", "B00F4FFO8E", "B000IJ79VQ", "B0000633UA", "B0000AXE8I", "B000H30B2C", "B0001BKAEY", "0790736411", "B00005JN0T", "B000UNYK4E", "B0001I55N8", "B000KJU1KK", "B00004Z4WR", "B000VNMMR0", "B0006GAO5Y", "B00005JKWJ", "B000U7WV1Y", "B00008G8M4", "B0009A409S", "B0001QNNS4", "B000O78KW4", "B00BEZTMFY", "B001TODCII", "B0009RCPY8", "B001PPLIEG", "B00003CY0V", "B00000JQB5"], "bought_together": ["B00005JMQW", "B000UR9T8C"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004LWZWFQ", "B003YAR97K", "B00005JMQW", "B000UR9T8C"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 9011}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.75, "brand": "Marvel Kids", "asin": "B00005JKCH", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5108SSFB9GL._SX300_.jpg", "title": "Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)"}

{"description": "An enormously entertaining (if somewhat shallow) affair from blockbuster   director Steven Spielberg. Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Frank Abagnale,  Jr., a  dazzling young con man who spent four years impersonating an  airline pilot, a  doctor, and a lawyer--all before he turned 21. All the  while he's pursued by a  dedicated FBI agent named Carl Hanratty (Tom  Hanks), whose dogged determination  stays one step behind Abagnale's  spontaneous wits. Both DiCaprio and Hanks turn  in enjoyable  performances and the movie has a bouncy rhythm that keeps it  zipping  along. However, it never gets under the surface of Frank's drive to lose   himself in other identities, other than a simplistic desire to please  his father  (Christopher Walken, excellent as always), nor does it  explore the complex  mechanics of fraud with any depth. By the movie's  end, it feels like one of  Frank's pilot uniforms--appearance without  substance.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00080ZG10", "B006OFN0SE", "B000M341QE", "B00AEBB8NI", "B001EZE5DI", "B004SIP7TE", "B000MZHW40", "0767905385", "B00005JMYC", "B002ZG980U", "B00049QQHI", "B0016Q2D66", "B00AEBB9F0", "B00003CWM3", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B000P0J0EW", "B00008DP4C", "B000PHVZNE", "B001N44BVQ", "B00005JOC9", "B004SIP7ZS", "B0007DFJ0G", "B007SPPANM", "B00H9KKGTO", "B002T9H2LA", "0800141806", "B000N6U0E2", "B000P0J0EM", "B00AEBB89W", "B000FVQLQQ", "B00001ZWUS", "B0050546MS", "B00DHHWXYY", "0783225733", "6304711891", "B00AEFY0F2", "B002VWNIEA", "B0051MKNV8", "B002ZG99N6", "B0077ATSSQ", "B00011CZRE", "B0013XZ2QK", "B00275EGWY", "B00005JKBC", "B00003CXWV", "B002O5M4T4", "B002FU8IWU", "B008MILL8W", "B004XQO90O", "B004SIP95G", "B000YAF4MA", "B005LAIIJY", "B00005JMJG", "B002QEHPQU", "0780631536", "B00DHDDE32", "B0031OCY2E", "0783240295", "B000P0J0BK", "B004FQX5B6", "B0034G4OUO", "B005HWAOP2", "6305313687", "B003UESJH4", "B000YABYLA", "B00005JKWX", "B00BEIYL6G", "B0058JEHSO", "B000A7DVR2", "B0002ZDVEU", "B00003CXZ1", "B00003CXQ4", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00005RYLX", "B001VPCINK", "B000FKO5QK", "B0045HCJRG", "B009POCG0Y", "B00AEBB9SM", "B002UZCJ8Y", "B002DU39GW", "6304806434", "B00JQYV0B4", "B00AEFXE9U", "B00004WG2F", "B000EXZFCQ", "B00005JMCN", "B00006RCNV", "B000K7VHQE", "B00441GYXS", "B00A24CAAW", "B0045HCJ8K", "B004SIP9Z6", "B002NZK5R8", "B000K7VHTQ", "B00AEFXXMI", "B00005JL78", "0783233477", "B000J3OTT6", "B000O77SRC"], "bought_together": ["B00080ZG10", "B000M341QE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004SIP7TE", "B002ZG980U", "B00AEBB8NI", "B00ALTQRPW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 7335}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.99, "brand": "Dreamworks Skg", "asin": "B00005JLSB", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51bPnAto--L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Catch Me If You Can (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition)"}

{"description": "James Bond DVDs have in general been pretty loaded, butDie Another Dayraises the bar with a two-disc set featuring dynamic DTS 6.1 ES and Dolby Digital 5.1 EX sound that makes good use of the rear speakers. The first commentary track is by Pierce Brosnan and Rosamund Pike (who plays villain Miranda Frost). They weren't together at the time, so their comments are spliced into one track. Brosnan has a good time watching and is proud of the film but also doesn't take himself too seriously (\"They don't teach you this stuff at drama school: 'OK, now you're going to be electrocuted by the bad guy.'\"). Self-proclaimed \"Bond novice\" Pike also is proud of the film and says she's annoyed by people who question whether there's still a need for Bond. On the second commentary track, director Lee Tamahori and producer Michael G. Wilson chat about topics as diverse as casting, Bond lore, and product placements. For more Bond lore, don't overlook the trivia track, which offers pop-up tidbits about the filming and tips on the inside jokes.The centerpiece of the second disc is the 80-minute \"InsideDie Another Day\" documentary, which is a set of featurettes strung together. Topics include the opening surfing sequence; the scenes set in North Korea and Cuba (including Halle Berry's bikini tribute to Ursula Andress); the ice palace; post-production elements such as computer graphics, editing, and music; the car battle (finding strong ice was the key safety issue); and the passing of the \"Q\" torch from Desmond Llewellyn to John Cleese.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000NIBURQ", "B000M53GM2", "B000RPCK1U", "B000NDEXPM", "B000M53GMW", "B000RPCK1K", "B000RPCK24", "B000NIBURG", "B000M53GLS", "B000RPCK1A", "B000NIBUR6", "B000M53GN6", "B001PPLIEG", "B001R10BN2", "B00AQSN7HE", "B000RPCK0Q", "B000M53GNG", "B000NIBUS0", "B000NDEXPC", "B00004RG62", "B000M53GMC", "B007REV4T8", "B00004WEJZ", "B00005JL0I", "B009PN18R2", "B008YAPQX4", "B004BR7XLM", "B009PN3OD8", "B003QO8TOQ", "B000HRMAPE", "B000VNMMR0", "B0000BYRO7", "B00AZFECL8", "B000EGDB10", "B004EPYZUS", "B0004Z33EQ", "B00AIBZMD6", "B009A87Z6U", "B009RO9LKK", "B000SK5Z70", "B00003CXMV", "6305657947", "B00005JLYW", "B00005JN2Z", "B00023B1LC", "B005PTYP70", "B00008G8M4", "B00005JNJV", "B00000G3PA", "B000P0J06K", "B002UZCJ8Y", "B002ZG9864", "0792844068", "B00005JKIP", "0792166736", "0790732238", "B00AS1Q93S", "B003Q6D2B4", "B0002I84N0", "B000U1ZV8K", "B008JFURII", "B00JA3RVG4", "B000MZHW40", "B00026ZG10", "0790732149", "B000FKO3HG", "B000AP04FG", "B008JFUS0U", "B0001FGC1U", "B00005JMQW", "B009L6UDUG", "B00AVWIQZS", "B0013BM63O", "B00005JLRT", "B00E5I2M6I", "B001TK80C0", "B00AZMFJYA", "B0007KZQAM", "B002ZG999U", "B00BUAEYVK", "B009A87ZQU", "B000P0J06U", "B008JFUO72", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B00003CY0V", "B00E5I2MCM", "B0036TGSR6", "B003AWRMBU", "B0000BYRO9", "B008JFUNHI", "B00177YA1K", "6304696221", "B0021L8V0M", "B00006G8FD", "B000UR9T8C", "B002GNOSFM", "B003UESJFQ", "B0006L0LOS", "B000AYELVU"], "bought_together": ["B000NIBURQ", "B000M53GM2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000M53GM2", "B000RPCK1U", "B000M53GN6", "B000RPCK0Q"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 38500}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.0, "brand": "MGM", "asin": "B00005JLBE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51kgPWMuVFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Die Another Day (Widescreen Special Edition)"}

{"description": "There's only one deleted scene in this two-disc DVD set, but it's a doozy. The \"Sgt. Candy Scene\" is a must-see and, unfortunately, the best thing on the second disc. The rushed HBO documentary shows us far more flash than substance. Better is the Visual Effects Lab that goes more in-depth with four sequences, although you need to wade through a hokey interface for each segment. Making your \"own\" effects isn't that much fun; you can only choose a few effects that change in two scenes. Anyone looking to get the complicated backstory of the trilogy figured out should dig into the \"Sky Net Database\" and an intricate timeline. The two commentary tracks are worth a listen, with director Jonathan Mostow's solo track the better one. The director goes into great detail on how the little things (from lighting street scenes to tricks for destroying buildings) count.  The second track is pieced together from the actors recorded separately. Mostow appears with actress Claire Danes (doing her first commentary track) and their chemistry is enjoyable after a slow start. The other actors have less interesting things to say, including Schwarzenegger who is constantly--yet enthusiastically--selling the film.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001VLBDD0", "B00005N5S5", "B001FB55HQ", "B00005JA8B", "B00070FX5U", "B00007AJG4", "B002ZG98LO", "B000T9OP7G", "B002GHHHME", "B00005JKIP", "B002QFYJFY", "B0002J58HO", "B0000AXE8I", "B001AQO43M", "B00AKGG828", "B00026ZG10", "B0001BKAEY", "B00IZZDWKM", "B001451HXO", "B0000VCZK2", "B000056PMU", "B000BPL2FQ", "B000RW3VCK", "B0004Z33F0", "B000U1ZV8K", "B0045HCJGC", "B0004Z33EQ", "B00005JNTU", "B000HRMAPE", "B00008G8M4", "B000RRS7RE", "B00005JKYX", "B0000VD12I", "B000FC2FQA", "B00000ILDG", "B00000G3PA", "B00005JMZK", "B000MGBSE4", "B0087ZG7J8", "B0004Z33EG", "B000P0J0AQ", "B00005JMEW", "B0087ZG7NO", "B00003CXTA", "B0002CHK1S", "B000RJO56E", "B00177YA1K", "B00004STDN", "B005COLETU", "B001AK3S4Y", "B000VNMMR0", "B0000959N0", "B00005JMUA", "1558908846", "6305767866", "B001RIY4WE", "B0049IHX2C", "B000VI70QS", "B000EGDB10", "B002GSXKN8", "B00HZMZ2FE", "B0045HCJ9O", "B003QO8TOQ", "B00005JNJV", "B001451HX4", "B00I9TDMRM", "B0006GANOQ", "B00003CXSP", "6305428115", "B00016MSV2", "B00005JOC9", "B000TJBN80", "B009MO57H6", "B000O77SQS", "B0087ZG7HK", "B001OST0M6", "B005LAIHXQ", "B0002J4X1Q", "B0002V7OI8", "B0015XHP2C", "6304806434", "B000QXDED6", "B00005JL3K", "B008JFUPFI", "B003PIUINS", "0783225946", "0792839056", "B00005N7Z1", "B0006GAO6I", "B001DZOC6Y", "B00005JL78", "B001HN697M", "B00IJS2OXG", "B002NXSRVG", "B00008G8M5", "B00005JN0T", "B003XURDAY", "B000O77SRM", "B006VRRGNK", "B00F4FFO8E"], "bought_together": ["B001VLBDD0", "B00005N5S5"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001VLBDD0", "B00005N5S5", "B001FB55HQ", "B002JT6AO0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 115564}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 13.47, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00005JM0B", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5143TFPX8SL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "TheDaredeviltwo-DVD set has plenty to please both film and comic fans. The best feature is an hourlong collection of interviews of people who worked on the comic book, from Stan Lee to Frank Miller to Kevin Smith.  (Yes, sharp-eyed fans: the Elektra-Bullseye showdown was closely based onDaredevil#181.)  On the film side, director-screenwriter Mark Steven Johnson and producer Gary Foster's commentary track provides background info and some fawning over Jennifer Garner, a text commentary provides more trivia and inside jokes, and an enhanced viewing mode offers production-design featurettes. Most prominently among a bunch of other features, another hourlong documentary goes behind the shooting of the film, and Garner tries to keep a straight face during her screen test.

{"description": "A broad science fiction thriller in a classic vein,Equilibriumtakes a respectable stab at aFahrenheit 451-like cautionary fable. The story finds Earth's post-World War III humankind in a state of severe emotional repression: If no one feels anything, no one will be inspired by dark passions to attack their neighbors. Writer-director Kurt Wimmer's monochromatic,Metropolis-influenced cityscape provides an excellent backdrop to the heavy-handed mission of John Preston (Christian Bale), a top cop who busts \"sense offenders\" and crushes sentimental, sensual, and artistic relics from a bygone era. Predictably, Preston becomes intrigued by his victims and that which they die to cherish; he stops taking his mandatory, mood-flattening drug and is even aroused by a doomed prisoner (Emily Watson). Wimmer's wrongheaded martial arts/dueling guns motif is sheer silliness (a battle over a puppy doesn't help), butEquilibriumshould be seen for Bale's moving performance as a man shocked back to human feeling.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00006JDVV", "B000LC55F2", "B000FS9FCG", "B0009A40ES", "B000KX0IM2", "B0007Y08QA", "B00AEFYCW8", "0767805712", "B00005JL78", "B0018O4YT0", "B001FB55HQ", "B00003CXZ4", "B00AEFXCLU", "B000FGGE68", "B000WMA6R8", "B002ZG980U", "B003XURDAY", "B00HOGBXS6", "B00005JPAR", "B000GFLKF8", "B00K2CHX9C", "B00AEFXW8I", "B000XR9L50", "B004XQO90O", "B000N6TX1I", "B000FKO5QK", "B004SIP9Z6", "B007WZTMCI", "B0007DFJ0G", "B000093FLA", "B0073U2FB2", "0783225814", "B000K7VHQ4", "B001OQCVI8", "B00011CZRE", "B000P0J0AQ", "B00000JSJC", "B0000AXE8I", "B008JFUQZ2", "B007X4ECMI", "B002ZG97CO", "B00AZMFJYA", "B008JFUO36", "B004P2VQZC", "B0000AC8LR", "B0045HCJT4", "B00J5LXT6M", "B00AEFY5B6", "B002UZCJ8Y", "B001GZ6QC4", "B00177Y9ZC", "B003UESJHO", "B000XA5K48", "B001DJLD1M", "B008JFUN50", "B005LAIHXQ", "B00K7IPFSM", "B0006IIPIK", "B005LAII8A", "B0013PSTMC", "B008JFUNHI", "B001L57ZYM", "B002QEHPQU", "B0034G4ORC", "B004SIP95G", "0767802519", "B001TOD92C", "B008JFUS0U", "B000087F6L", "B0051MKNV8", "B007WXUVHU", "B005LAIH2C", "B000R9U3B0", "B004LWZW7E", "B000MZHW40", "B00005JNJV", "B00005JPD0", "B000GGSMC6", "B0000ACOXL", "B0085A9HU6", "B009YQJ322", "B003Y5H5GK", "B009MO57H6", "B004LWZW4M", "0800195175", "B002QW7ALM", "B00005JMA8", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B001EAWMGA", "B002O3Z4WU", "B000BW7QWW", "B001GUYB08", "B00005V9HH", "B001UV4XWY", "B00A8MGIZG", "B002GSXKNI", "B00IARA8KM", "B004LWZWGA", "B00005JA8B", "B001QTXM5Y"], "bought_together": ["B000LC55F2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0007Y08QA", "B006ZL1PGG", "B000LC55F2", "B004P7CMJG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 61424}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.34, "brand": "Dimension", "asin": "B00005JLWN", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51K2WVH130L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Equilibrium"}

{"description": "The seemingly obligatory director's commentary is not on this two-disc set of Michael Mann's slick thriller yet the extras are so good you won't miss it. On the surface, there's nothing out of the ordinary here with the exception of a few minutes of rehearsal footage, but everything is just so darn interesting to watch. Mann and his stars dish about the making of the film, including the creation of Cruise's assassin. The nighttime shooting (shot digitally and transferred sublimely) is examined along with a single deleted scene (with a clear explanation on why it was cut).

{"description": "Woman Thou Art Loosedis a powerful, tragic feature film adaptation of the bestselling,inspirational bookof the same name by Dallas-based minister T.D. Jakes. Jakes plays himself in this fictional movie (which is derived from his work with women seeking guidance after experiences of abuse), lending his golden presence in a story about a death row inmate, Michelle (Kimberly Elise), whose childhood rape by her clueless mother's boyfriend leads to one catastrophe after another. Elise is very good in a difficult part, her character deeply cynical and seemingly beyond the reach of love, yet still human. The rest of the cast is also very fine: Loretta Devine as the ever-in-denial mom, Michael Boatman as a childhood friend who recalls Michelle's innocence, and Sean Blakemore as a criminal trying to steal the doomed heroine's soul. Veteran television director Michael Schultz ably guides the drama toward its quiet, unforgettable ending.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0088RMEII", "B001QUF7DS", "B003ESP636", "B006IVNIS6", "B00BEL4QFO", "B003Y5H4ZC", "B005LAIH1S", "B003Y5H58S", "B00H91LVTM", "B000IONJHY", "B000LW7REE", "B002VKB0LU", "B0064OTH8C", "B005LAIH86", "B000PE0GRI", "B000M2DLJI", "B008SOS7W8", "B008SOSB0G", "B00AJLHVES", "B008Y1YJN6", "B004MCGNS0", "B000R17RQM", "B000CBP02A", "B000GH3CEI", "B000YDMPB0", "B0018RNF60", "B000YDMPBA", "B00I0CAVV8", "B003Y5H56K", "B00007K02J", "B00EJU9GQ6", "B00AZMFJ90", "B0055OTDCM", "B0046GDMV8", "B002VECM4A", "B000GH3CE8", "B008FCX2D2", "B002ZG99RW", "B000YAF4Q6", "B004D45NY2", "B000JLTRH2", "B00013WWSO", "B00097DXFS", "B00GOZ2LPM", "B0010YVCAW", "B007P9HVJC", "B000FA57JE", "B00GR33LAK", "B000F9SO0O", "B00BNV9WCW", "B00HW3EI3I", "B001132GNY", "B004ULNJIA", "B000ZIZX3G", "B00BJO5SPS", "B00BYS0RQE", "B00DW5IKNO", "B00BI6SUIE", "B00FK9KT70", "B00003W8NT", "B001JV5BC6", "B00769U94K", "B00AZL310A", "6305428409", "B00465I192", "B003L16FCC", "B0009A40NO", "B00HSS7N2U", "B00CWBPQ22", "B0026JI1R2", "B00005LB86", "B0009A40NE", "B00HX0KIAM", "B005DEUEYA", "B00JPFTS2M", "B002CAWNEM", "B001DJLCQS", "B00H47IX5G", "B00000JGHV", "B0089BSN5Q", "0768424038", "B0009A40O8", "B006U49SJE", "B00005ASOO", "B000BQ7J8Y", "0768403006", "B000FIKFRK", "B00AEFXY6I", "B00GO4RGWQ", "B000W04S1A", "B000JSI7IU", "B00JPFTW1E", "B005KR6NNG", "B003UEYBPI", "B000069I0E", "B0041H55S0", "B007HHWJSA", "B00BTYPWDQ", "B000Q7ZNZ4", "B0009A40NY"], "bought_together": ["B0088RMEII", "B005LAIH1S"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0088RMEII", "B003Y5H4ZC", "0768424038", "B000LW7REE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 62025}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 22.0, "brand": "ELISE,KIMBERLY", "asin": "B00005JNRM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51E628QMJML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Woman Thou Art Loosed"}

{"description": "Marvel Comics' first family of superherodom, the Fantastic Four, hits the big screen in a light-hearted and funny adventure.  It begins when down-on-his-luck genius Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd,Horatio Hornblower) has to enlist the financial and intellectual help from former schoolmate and rival Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon,Nip/Tuck) in order to pursue outer-space research into human DNA.  Also on the trip are Reed's best friend, Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis,The Shield); his former lover, Sue Storm (Jessica Alba,Dark Angel,Sin City), who's now Doom's employee and love interest; and her hotshot-pilot brother, Johnny Storm (Chris Evans,Cellular).  Things don't go as planned, of course, and the quartet becomes blessed--or is it cursed?--with superhuman powers: flexibility, brute strength, invisibility and projecting force fields, and bursting into flame.  Meanwhile, Doom himself is undergoing a transformation.Among the many entries in the comic-book-movie frenzy,Fantastic Fouris refreshing because it doesn't take itself too seriously. Characterization isn't too deep, and the action is a bit sparse until the final reel (like most \"first\" superhero movies, it has to go through the \"how did we get these powers and what we will do with them\" churn). But it's a good-looking cast, and original comic-book cocreator Stan Lee makes his most significant Marvel-movie cameo yet, in a speaking role as the FF's steadfast postal carrier, Willie Lumpkin. Newcomers to superhero movies might find the idea of a family with flexibility, strength, invisibility, and force fields a retread ofThe Incredibles, but Pixar's animated film was very much a tribute to the FF and other heroes of the last 40 years. The irony is that whileFantastic Fouris an enjoyable B-grade movie, it's the tribute,The Incredibles, that turned out to be a film for the ages.--David HoriuchiOn the DVDThe principal extra on the DVD is a spirited commentary track by Jessica Alba, Michael Chiklis, and Ioan Gruffud.  Self-avowed FF fan Chiklis explains why the Thing doesn't have a craggy brow, Alba recalls which things were \"cool,\" and they talk about looking forward to the sequel. There are three short deleted scenes (including a goofy Wolverine reference), 20 minutes of barely watchable hand-held video footage from the press tour, music videos, and some short featurettes including an appearance by FF creator Stan Lee.--David HoriuchiThe Fantastic Four at Amazon.comComics and Graphic NovelsDisney animated seriesThe classic comic bookMovie tie-in graphic novelThe Xbox gameFantastic FourSoundtrackThe Fantastic CastJessica Albaas Sue StormMichael Chiklisas The ThingIoan Gruffuddas Reed RichardsChris Evansas Johnny StormStills fromFantastic Four(click for larger images)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000VI70QS", "B0000959N0", "B001DHXT20", "B0007P0Y7C", "B004EPZ07K", "B001CDR1FG", "B00E5I2MEK", "B001GCUO1Q", "B00E5I2M9K", "B00E5I2MCM", "B000OVLBF8", "B00005JMQW", "B008JFUO72", "B004LWZW42", "B00E5I2M6I", "B000UR9T8C", "B0090SI56Y", "B000HEVZ9E", "B000HCO83Q", "B00005JKCH", "B005OY6LBE", "B001OQCVI8", "B008JFUS0U", "B004LWZWFQ", "B000AYELVU", "B0002IQMAM", "B003YAR97K", "B0083SBMBM", "B001QB9H1U", "B001AK3S4Y", "B005LAIGW8", "B000AYELVA", "B001F7MSFM", "B0006L0LOS", "B003H8F3AY", "B008JFUPFI", "B006DHAT5K", "B002GSXKN8", "B002ZG99G8", "B00005JNJV", "B002IPFWTE", "B002NXSRVG", "B000VR0570", "B0006D3HGA", "B004LWZWGA", "B005LAII44", "B000YV1Q2G", "B00F4FFO8E", "B005G4TJUC", "B00005JN0T", "B0007US7CQ", "B00E1HIXEI", "B000J10EQU", "B0002KVUKM", "B000VKL6T8", "B001TK80C0", "B002ZG99B8", "B000Y7U98C", "B002GSXKNI", "B00005JM5B", "B001GZ6QC4", "B000PFUAP0", "B00005JKWJ", "B0009P42WI", "B00174RCHW", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B00005JKYX", "B005TK0MFE", "B000VNMMPW", "B001QTXM5Y", "B000EU1Q7M", "B00008G8M4", "B000P6XQ50", "B00005JN5E", "B0007V6ITE", "B001VLBDD0", "B005LAIH54", "B001FB55HQ", "B000IJ79WU", "B008Y1YK9Y", "B00561BNJK", "B001VLFE7G", "B000CNER1S", "B00K7IPFSM", "B001BP4K22", "B00005JL78", "B0001CNRS4", "B00979KQD6", "B00157OI9Q", "B004EPYZUS", "B002HWRYJE", "B009YQJ322", "B003Y5H5EW", "0780624890", "B001RHGRT8", "B0013J55B6", "B0013BM63O", "B0053FANPY", "B009MO57H6", "078401132X"], "bought_together": ["B000VI70QS", "B001DHXT20"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000VI28Z6", "B000VI70QS", "B008JFUS0U", "B0090SI56Y"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 12162}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.98, "brand": "Twentieth Century Fox", "asin": "B00005JNTU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51AM4R5J04L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Fantastic Four (Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "The second DVD ofMillion Dollar Babyoffers just under an hour of bonus material.  In the 19-minute \"Born to Fight,\" the cast discusses women boxers.  It's fairly routine, except that cast member Lucia Rijker, who played Billie the Blue Bear, is a real-life boxer some of whose experiences mirrored those of Maggie Fitzgerald in the film.  There's also 13 minutes of interviews with the film's producers, and a 24-minute roundtable in which James Lipton interviews Clint Eastwood, Hilary Swank, and Morgan Freeman.  All displaying their Oscar statuettes, they discuss Eastwood's directorial style, the craft of acting, and Freeman's dance background.  For whatever reason, throughout the bonus features the central issue of the film's final act is briefly acknowledged, but not discussed.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B003ASLJO0", "B003ASLJQS", "B000ARTN3I", "B003AWRMCE", "B001P9KR8U", "B000A3XY5A", "B000M341QE", "B004SIP8ZM", "B003AWRMBA", "B00275EGWY", "B003ASLJJU", "B00782O7IY", "B000FVQLQQ", "B00AEFY0F2", "B004EQAVA0", "B003AWRMC4", "B00011CZRE", "B00AHTYI5M", "B004SIP7ZS", "B003ASLJIQ", "B003UESJHO", "B003UESJH4", "B003ASLJOU", "B000P0J0EW", "B003AWRM9M", "B00AEFY5B6", "B009POCG2C", "B002VECM6S", "B00AEFXVOI", "B003ASLJS6", "B000P0J0EM", "B00388PK7O", "B003AWRMA6", "B004SIP7VM", "B003ASLJKE", "B004SIP7F8", "B003AWRM9W", "B00AEFXOKO", "B000055Y0Y", "B0001FVDJQ", "B004SIP9U6", "B0006GAO5Y", "B001FZQOW2", "B004FQX5B6", "B002JCSWV6", "B003LR5BD0", "B00AEFXESQ", "B001NFNFNU", "B004SIP7TE", "B003ASLJNQ", "B00AEBB8NI", "B004SEUJBE", "B003ASLJMW", "B002ZG99N6", "B00003CWN3", "B000P0J09M", "B00005JKWX", "B00B0U2SFE", "B00009N83V", "B004SIP95G", "B000YAF4MA", "B000N6U0E2", "B0006GAOJA", "B00005JKMQ", "B0007DFJ0G", "B0006HBV3W", "B003AWRMBU", "B002VWNIEA", "B00G4Q3KOC", "B001BL96K2", "B0000YEEGM", "B00AEFXKUI", "B0015XHQT4", "B00001ZWUS", "B000BYA4HE", "B00005JMCN", "B000683VI4", "B000MZHW40", "B00004BZIY", "B002VWNIBI", "B002Z7FWBI", "B003ASLJRC", "B000XR9L50", "B00005JLSB", "B00012FXJ0", "B00AEFYSWM", "B000KJTGHO", "B002CPMB9O", "B0009S4IKQ", "0783225725", "B00005JN0W", "B0060ZJ7BC", "B00AEBB9CS", "B00005JPBO", "6305313687", "6305212112", "B00K2CHUWW", "B00003CXCF", "0767802519", "B003ASLJK4"], "bought_together": ["B003ASLJO0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000ARTN3I", "B00003CXNY", "B009JBWOU0", "B003AWRMCE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 90739}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.95, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00005JNP1", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41yRyrBhN-L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Million Dollar Baby (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "InCry_Wolf, a group of students at a snooty prep school conjure a serial killer when someone takes a hoax a little too seriously. Owen (Julian Morris,Whirlygirl), who's just transferred to Westlake Academy, quickly becomes enamored of Dodger (Lindy Booth,Wrong Turn), a smart and sultry redhead who masterminds a game based on lying and manipulating the other players. After a murder in the nearby woods, Owen escalates the game by concocting a hoax about a serial killer called the Wolf--a hoax that swiftly turns into reality when the not-so-imaginary Wolf sends threatening e-mails to Owen.Cry_Wolfmixes your standard slasher movie with your standard secret-twist movie to no particularly effect. The Wolf--who wears an orange ski-mask and wields a hunting knife--is a generic boogeyman; text messages just aren't scary; and all the characters combined couldn't muster up an engaging personality. This movie was obviously made to fit a market niche, not because a writer or director had any genuine inspiration or had to exorcise a personal fear--but even for a b-movie this is meager stuff. Also featuring Jon Bon Jovi (Vampires: Los Muertos), Gary Cole (Office Space), and Anna Deavere Smith (The West Wing).--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B004CWLRF4", "B00083FZGI", "B000AM4P9K", "B001UE7D6O", "B001F0TT6A", "B00005JOWW", "B001NPD9LS", "B000C65Z8Y", "B000C6NOY6", "B000EOTVU2", "B00275EHDM", "B0042FUHRK", "B0000VCZNE", "B00006FD9N", "B004VLLWA6", "B00005JMDZ", "0767824954", "B000PMLJMQ", "B000FLKJ2S", "B002JT69IW", "6305238065", "B001AV3BWM", "B00003CXUP", "B0007WQHI0", "B002GHHHME", "B000O77SN6", "B00008LUNW", "B004P7CN3G", "B00575GYT4", "B000RGN2JI", "B004EPZ08O", "B000MEYKBY", "B004P7CNUY", "B0026LQM2Q", "B0007KIFI2", "B001D2WU9I", "B000P0J056", "B00AZTUUQK", "B00005UQ9W", "B000IHY9TS", "B00004YA1F", "0790751658", "0441016154", "6305090564", "B000OCY7TY", "1608871452", "B00111YM5Q", "B000MM0LIM", "B000NO3DLG", "B008JFUNYG", "B004EI2NP4", "B003PIUINS", "B000E8N8H0", "B00IYLX5E0", "B001SSHPLA", "B000O77SMW", "B000WC389G", "B000VSDNFA", "B000OVLBF8", "B0018BA72G"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004CWLRF4", "B000AM4P9K", "B001UE7D6O", "B00083FZGI"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "asin": "B00005JOHF", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4108208BHVL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Cry_Wolf"}

{"description": "The supercharged possibilities of a single set and two amped-up actors are explored inHard Candy, a twisted cocktail with a poison kicker. After a flirtatious encounter in an online chat room, two people agree to meet for coffee:  a 32-year-old man (Patrick Wilson) and a 14-year-old girl (Ellen Page). They quickly advance to his house, and just as quickly, the apparent pedophilic seduction morphs into something else entirely. After the tables turn,Hard Candybecomes a tale of revenge and torture that might have tempted a filmmaker like Park Chanwook. Here, first-time feature director David Slade opts for a slick look that stays close to the actors, and you can't really blame him--this movie is like a conceptual, more-than-slightly unbelievable off-Broadway play, a showcase for actors and \"controversial\" ideas. Those actors are strong:  Patrick Wilson (Angels in America,Phantom of the Opera) is every bit as creepy as he needs to be, and Ellen Page has nothing short of a triumph. The Canadian actress was around 18 when she shot the film, but looks like an adolescent, which makes her authoritative wrath all the more shocking to witness. The provocations ofHard Candysometimes seem arbitrary or forced, but Page's electrifying performance can't be denied, or dismissed.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0017VG5XM", "B00177YA6U", "B002VPTJOA", "B000ARFPMQ", "B004U7MR3W", "B0037E8HOC", "B00DVD5STQ", "B000YABYLA", "B00187FPC2", "B001MEJY8W", "B000WC38EQ", "B0013D8L7M", "B002EOVXBK", "B000FVQM2Y", "B000UCD4L0", "B00009MEC4", "B0051PLQR0", "6305313687", "B001G9CNI6", "B005Z9MGRG", "B003U6SJY0", "B008NNY8XQ", "B00125WATQ", "B0014VPFVS", "B00006AUIG", "B00DMUFXOS", "B001J4E19C", "B002VPTJNQ", "B00000I1KK", "B003L20IEC", "B004OUZLGK", "B000N3SU92", "B00699G622", "B00005Q4CS", "B0057ZAA6W", "B00005JMJG", "B008G1JIQC", "B0021L8UPS", "B00441GYVK", "B0007PID84", "B000NO39FG", "B00B96TGQS", "B001B187L6", "B000OYCMLM", "B005SQRYB4", "B0000AOX0A", "B000A2X3U2", "B00G5GNYY2", "B008G33PIM", "B0020LH8WU", "6305428484", "B000MMMTBY", "B002LMSWN2", "B007CZ3E7C", "B002USF1WC", "B004SIP9Z6", "B00005U14H", "0767802519", "B00AEFY2AA", "B0001GF2D8", "B001D2WU9I", "B00009W0U4", "B0000694XX", "B004LWZW24", "B0083QN87K", "B004Z1HY2W", "B000HC2LFI", "B0002J4X1Q", "B0000CABGW", "B007L6VRBM", "B0001EFUFK", "B003626TNG", "B009XTF8KQ", "B00ELQHX5O", "B007UW9W8W", "B001JNNDJM", "157362408X", "B0058ZPNOK", "B000EOTVU2", "B0082CWTSY", "B00AZTUUQK", "B001C5LLVE", "B000PKG8TM", "B00003CWQR", "B00007976U", "B001CDFY64", "B004XVMCH6", "B00003CWN3", "B0028DRGDQ", "B000FS2W3A", "B001U0HBQA", "B000N3AW6G", "B00005QAOZ", "B00BSU0FQA", "B00003CXKM", "B0002MPQRS", "B00BEIYGT8", "B0004Z31OS", "B001AZKB8K"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002VPTJOA", "B00177YA6U", "B001MEJY8W", "B0017VG5XM"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 421858}, "asin": "B00005JP3W", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51FEBBE1B9L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Hard Candy"}
{"description": "Helen Mirren reigns supreme inThe Queen, a witty and ingenious look at a moment that rocked the house of Windsor:  the week that followed the sudden death of Princess Diana in 1997. Diana's death came at just the same time that Prime Minister Tony Blair (played by the bright Michael Sheen) was settling into his new government--and trying to figure out the delicate relationship between 10 Downing Street and Queen Elizabeth II (Mirren). A large portion of the British population was trying to figure out the Windsors that week, as Elizabeth remained stiff-upper-lip and largely mum about the death of the beloved princess. In Peter Morgan's skillful script, we watch as Blair grows increasingly impatient with the Royals, who are sequestered in their Scottish estate while the public demands some show of grief. Prince Philip (James Cromwell, in good form) clumsily decides to take Diana's sons hunting, while a sympathetically-treated Prince Charles (Alex Jennings) displays some frustration with his mother's eerie calm.None of this conveys how funny the film is, or how deftly it flows from one scene to the next. Director Stephen Frears (Dirty Pretty Things) deserves great credit for that, and for the performances, and for the movie's marvelous sense of well-roundedness; you could see this movie and groan at the cluelessness of the Royals and their outmoded existence, or you might just sympathize with showing reserve in a world that values gross public displays of emotion.

{"description": "The fact-based mystery ofHollywoodlandtakes place in 1959, when the death ofAdventures of SupermanTV star George Reeves cast a pall over the waning days of golden-age Hollywood. As written by Paul Bernbaum, this intriguing whodunit effectively evokes the tainted atmosphere that surrounded Reeves' death (officially ruled a suicide but never conclusively solved), and speculates on circumstances to suggest that Reeves may have been murdered. In combining the melancholy course of Reeves' career with the investigation of a down-and-out private detective into the possible causes of Reeves' death, the film evolves into an engrossing study of parallels between lives on either side of the Hollywood dream. Building upon a distinguished career in TV including episodes of HBO'sThe Sopranos,RomeandSix Feet Under, director Allen Coulter finds a satisfying balance between the tragic overtones of the Reeves case and the time-honored elements of the gumshoe genre, with Adrien Brody doing fine work as private eye Louis Simo, a fictional composite character who is our conduit to the desperate yearnings of Reeves' final months.In a critically acclaimed performance, Ben Affleck plays Reeves in moody flashbacks, caught betweenSupermanstardom and financial dependence on his lover Toni Mannix (Diane Lane), the somewhat predatory wife of Hollywood \"fixer\" and MGM honcho Eddie Mannix (Bob Hoskins), whose mob connections suggest foul play as Simo's investigation progresses. Reeves' subsequent lover (played by Robin Tunney) may also be culpable, and as Simo's own personal life unravels, his empathy for Reeves takes on added significance. In presenting its mystery as a set of plausible scenarios,Hollywoodlandholds interest as a mystery that's refreshingly compassionate toward the fate of its characters. Warts and all, they're likable dreamers in a town where dreams don't always come true.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000K2UVZM", "B002VWNICC", "B003P3PQL2", "B000A5046K", "B000BT96FA", "B000EU1Q3Q", "B000HWZ4E8", "B000IU37SO", "B00005JL5F", "B00015HWX2", "B0009G3B0G", "B00AEBB89W", "B000087F7Q", "B000QGEB1M", "B000LC3IDS", "B00003CWSR", "B003UESJEW", "B000EQHXNW", "B004SEUIZG", "0783235380", "B0001WTVIE", "B001NFNFNU", "1618933949", "B0002V7O5Q", "B000AM6P2U", "B000I8OM94", "B00J2PQYYK", "B00ICWO1LC", "B00006RCNY", "B00000K31T", "B0016Q2D66", "B00002RAO2", "B003UESJCY", "B000092T3P", "B000OYAT3U", "6305428522", "B003VEL9EI", "B00HZVX14O", "B004SIP7VM", "0790732149", "B001U0HB5Q", "B004XVMCH6", "B000HT3PBU", "B00AEFXRWO", "B00GUO2SKA", "B00006RCNV", "B004XVMCKS", "B0000959N0", "B00I116MVQ", "B000Q8QH0I", "B00AEFYC96", "B00ARA4SLU", "B00HGBAG5K", "B00006CXGZ", "B004LYWPZE", "B004ALIG1U", "B0016MOWOQ", "B000IJ79XE", "B00DC5JVE6", "B000M341SC", "B00029LO5E", "B00CHMBQRA", "B000F7CMRM", "B000FO0AHY", "B00E18QKJ2", "B0045O2PHS", "B004SIP7PS", "B0001NBNDY", "B00J5LXT44", "B003VE9WU6", "B000C65Z1G", "B00AEFYIDG", "B00005JMON", "B00005JL8F", "B00009MEKN", "B00HT2RTU6", "B000EHSVSC", "B0006IIKQW", "B00AEFXBPM", "B00HOGBXTU", "B003LR5BD0", "B0018O4YT0", "B0000694ZI", "B00005NKSK", "B002J1RZHE", "B000286RNE", "B0030BOCMS", "B00H91LVOM", "B000YV1Q2G", "B002DU39GW", "B003UESJEM", "B00F6SHG5S", "B000MXPE7O", "B001N44BVQ", "B0089XJXRQ", "B003EYVXSW", "B001DJ7PR8", "B0000C2IVA", "B000U1ZV76", "B0002O7XUO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000K2UVZM", "0596101996", "B002VWNICC", "0596805527"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 921340}, "asin": "B00005JP90", "imUrl": "http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-site/icons/no-img-sm._CB192198896_.gif", "title": "Hollywoodland"}

{"description": "The Dark Knightarrives with tremendous hype (best superhero movie ever? posthumous Oscar for Heath Ledger?), and incredibly, it lives up to all of it.  But calling it the best superhero movie ever seems like faint praise, since part of what makes the movie great--in addition to pitch-perfect casting, outstanding writing, and a compelling vision--is that it bypasses the normal fantasy element of the superhero genre and makes it all terrifyingly real.  Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) is Gotham City's new district attorney, charged with cleaning up the crime rings that have paralyzed the city. He enters an uneasy alliance with the young police lieutenant, Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman), and Batman (Christian Bale), the caped vigilante who seems to trust only Gordon--and whom only Gordon seems to trust. They make progress until a psychotic and deadly new player enters the game: the Joker (Heath Ledger), who offers the crime bosses a solution--kill the Batman. Further complicating matters is that Dent is now dating Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal, after Katie Holmes turned down the chance to reprise her role), the longtime love of Batman's alter ego, Bruce Wayne.In his last completed role before his tragic death, Ledger is fantastic as the Joker, a volcanic, truly frightening force of evil. And he sets the tone of the movie: the world is a dark, dangerous place where there are no easy choices.  Eckhart and Oldman also shine, but as good as Bale is, his character turns out rather bland in comparison (not uncommon for heroes facing more colorful villains). Director-cowriter Christopher Nolan (Memento) follows his critically acclaimedBatman Beginswith an even better sequel that sets itself apart from notable superhero movies likeSpider-Man 2andIron Manbecause of its sheer emotional impact and striking sense of realism--there are no suspension-of-disbelief superpowers here. At 152 minutes, it's a shade too long, and it's much too intense for kids. But for most movie fans--and not just superhero fans--The Dark Knightis a film for the ages.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B00DUCXFUC", "B004LWZWGK", "B000PC6A3E", "B002ZG981E", "B00G4RD4PQ", "B0039208QM", "B001GMALGY", "B00E2Y0YBK", "B00C2IGQBA", "B0039208JE", "B00H14WTLQ", "B0039208CG", "B0085D3I3K", "B0039208C6", "B000M5AJQI", "B00319ECGK", "B001FB55H6", "B00EIG5M5A", "7020070078", "B00E2Y6AUY", "B00D5FMGGS", "B001OQCV6K", "B0013FBS20", "B000Q6GX5Y", "B001GKJ2FC", "B00FPS79F6", "B001992NUQ", "B004JMSIRC", "B001RIY4WE", "B00DYEN6XC", "B008QZ5PY2", "B001F7MSG6", "B00FAHYNWE", "B00J7PRJXU", "B001AQT0Z4", "B001UV4XEW", "B0083SBJXS", "B00AEFY552", "B00C8RD79O", "B007KAJG3K", "B007L4HET8", "B004EPZ07U", "B007L4HFDI", "B00AEFXKOO", "B000PC0U1W", "B00C6B8TB8", "B00HINFI4K", "B003TT2X6I", "B001KZIRM2", "B002ZG99NG", "B00EZ4M68G", "B004SIP90G", "B003ZHR6RK", "B001GCUO16", "B003TT2X6S", "B00JNEWSLS", "B001F3FUK6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00DUCXFUC", "B004LWZWGK", "B002ZG981E", "B000PC6A3E"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "asin": "B00005JPY0", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51pGxSkkz4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Dark Knight [Theatrical Release]"}
{"description": "Harrison Ford is impossibly young and handsome as an American pilot in the World War II romanceHanover Street; Lesley-Anne Down (The Great Train Robbery) is stunningly beautiful as the British nurse who falls in love with him, despite being married to British intelligence agent Christopher Plummer. In fact, everything aboutHanover Streetis just a little over the top, from the insanely romantic dialogue to the absurd war-buddy banter of Ford and his bomber crew to the love-making montage in which Down seems to have at least a dozen orgasms. Down and Plummer have a daughter (played by futureLethal Weapon 2love interest Patsy Kensit) who's so precious and precocious you just want to smack her. The whole thing is almost a camp pastiche of a war romance--but when Ford and Plummer find themselves together behind enemy lines, you'll suddenly discover that you're caught up in the story. Through sheer movie-star charisma and cunningly ridiculous plot mechanics,Hanover Streetbecomes not only entertaining, but even touching. Plummer is particularly good as an ordinary man who wishes to become something more, Ford is stalwart as only he can be, and Down is just too lovely to resist (it's hard to understand how her career ended up with the likes ofBeastmaster 3: The Eye of BraxusandDeath Wish 5: The Face of Death). All in all, a surprisingly enjoyable cinematic experience.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000EOTW0Q", "B00AEFYXJ0", "B001DJLD08", "B000BYA4J2", "6305213283", "B000F8DV1M", "0792844017", "B002ZG97J2", "B00AEBB8YW", "B003ODIUZ2", "B00IJZW4HK", "B00AEFYENK", "B002ZG98FU", "B0001NBMHQ", "B00005QCVP", "B00008979P", "B00008R9M6", "B00AEBBA2W", "B00005JN9P", "B0000B00KB", "B00AEFXLKC", "B005DKS1TE", "B00744WZ6W", "B001SV3LL0", "B000062XEX", "B000KB48NE", "B000MGTQ7U", "B00096S4AS", "B000JYW5BE", "B002GHHHPQ", "B000TLTCPO", "B00JA3RVG4", "B0000EYUCK", "0792839064", "B00441GYXS", "B00005JKTF", "B0002I833Q", "B00FFT19XS", "B00DL48BM6", "B000FO0AA6", "B007701RFS", "B001U6YI8S", "B00125WAU0", "0767812115", "B00441GYYC", "B004IFYMXO", "B00AEFYBA6", "B00005OSJQ", "6305236569", "B00IJS2OHM", "B000CEV3M8", "B0007ZEOPK", "B003L20IG0", "B00A0KBE8M", "B00008AOTO", "B00IYRLUAU", "B00005JMLR", "B0000TG95Q", "B004IFYMXE", "0783230591", "B00005R23T", "B00005ATZT", "B00000JGHN", "B000ENC5YW"], "bought_together": ["B000EOTW0Q"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000EOTW0Q", "B000BYA4J2", "6305213283", "B005HWAOP2"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 45418}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.81, "brand": "Generic", "asin": "B00005LB88", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51JFCFJA97L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Hanover Street"}

{"description": "Jeremy Brett's portrayal of Sherlock Holmes is perhaps the best filmed version ofArthur Conan Doyle's famous detective, showcasing Holmes's dazzling brilliance without ignoring his unnerving intensity or drug dependencies. First aired on Britain's Granada Television in 1984, the series offered perfect casting (David Burke, replaced later in the run by Edward Hardwicke, played Dr. Watson as Holmes's sturdy companion and chronicler rather than as a buffoon), marvelousperiod musicby Patrick Gowers, and a running time of almost an hour per story, which allowed superior detail and faithfulness to the original source.The Adventures of Sherlock Holmesmarked the beginning of the long-running series. Highlights of these 13 episodes include \"A Scandal in Bohemia,\" which introduces Irene Adler (Gayle Hunnicutt), whom Holmes uncharacteristically describes as having \"a face a man might die for\"; the chilling locked-room mystery \"The Speckled Band\"; the introduction of Sherlock's brother Mycroft (Charles Gray) in \"The Greek Interpreter\"; and \"The Final Problem,\" in which Holmes confronts his arch-enemy Professor Moriarty (Eric Porter) at Reichenbach Falls in Switzerland. The five-disc boxed set is a great bargain compared to previous VHS releases, although bonus features are limited to English subtitles and galleries of Sidney Paget's famous illustrations. The series would continue on Granada withThe Return of Sherlock Holmes,The Casebook of Sherlock Holmes, andThe Memoirs of Sherlock Holmesas well as the stand-alone treatments ofThe Sign of FourandThe Hound of the Baskervilles.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00009WVO2", "B0002HODE0", "B00007H5C8", "B0002JP44G", "B00007G1WJ", "B001TE6P78", "B000BBOUGI", "B002EOVXAG", "B000RPCJB6", "B002OQZE6S", "B003BWN54C", "B002OQZE6I", "B008L0YN22", "B0028AENVC", "B002IJA66E", "B000EXZFRQ", "B00008XS0U", "B004QOB8SO", "B00E3UN44W", "B003UAKECG", "B002EOVXAQ", "B004132HZS", "B0023Y543Y", "B00007G1WI", "B0044LYRGO", "B00598O9RI", "B005X5XINI", "0788602047", "B00008YLTJ", "B000GY728I", "B002SRNNRU", "B003NF97NA", "B002Q3MYA8", "B00DUX28XQ", "B003YCI1UC", "B00007G1WM", "B004HJ0ZLE", "B00BEZEDNU", "B00GWXI16O", "B00GWXHYPI", "B003YCI238", "B00JJRLFTU", "B00DW5IKWK", "B000YDMPCO", "B000QGDJG0", "B003X2P9B2", "B006WNSHZO", "B00008XS0X", "B000WNHTCC", "B000060MV1", "B004ZEDJLY", "B0000797E7", "B00029NKS8", "1593080409", "B004WMOSNM", "B000068UE9", "B00006673M", "B00ANGICCO", "B00D7AM2V0", "1593080344", "B00008DDXE", "B00DC5K1FO", "B00114XLZK", "B009DS6YGO", "B0083HXKM2", "B002QU1Z1K", "B00008YLTK", "B005G172Q8", "B0028LOT7O", "B005DVIPY4", "B0036BDQ7Y", "B009D4SFEC", "B0007PALZW", "B00AEFYO5I", "B001OQCV6A", "B003BJODK0", "B00EV1YZD2", "B000O59A52", "B004Q5PPDM", "B00GD7UO4G", "B001D8W7EU", "B001UWOLQG", "B00383XZP8", "B0001DCYBE", "B0001DMUF4", "B005X5XI4C", "B00C888LOO", "B008N8A3DA", "B001V7YZAM", "B004AE3QUS", "B0002MK61E", "B000CC1TP6", "0553328255", "B00005JLCI", "B004K6FS5W", "B004HHX9H8", "B00IBKXP8A", "B00F1BFRA6", "B006JY3OHW", "B001ARDBXK"], "bought_together": ["B00009WVO2", "B0002HODE0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000RPCJB6", "B00009WVO2", "B00007H5C8", "B0002HODE0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 24161}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 34.23, "brand": "MPI Home Video", "asin": "B000060MVK", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/519Xz42tNfL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes (Boxed Set Collection)"}

{"description": "Behind the Sunis a rapturous Western, a big film about a big, unwanted destiny visited upon a vulnerable, young hero. Adapted from the novelBroken Aprilby Albanian writer Ismail Kadare (the story has been transferred from Europe to Brazil's rugged, northeastern badlands in  1910),Behind the Sunconcerns two families and their long-running land war, which has robbed many a young man of his hope, love and, ultimately, life. Sent by his aggrieved father to avenge the slaying of an older brother,  Tonho (Rodrigo Santoro), in torment, carries out his bloody, ancestral obligation and then proposes a truce between the families. Director Walter Salles (Central Station) aims to make a magnificently crafted, lush, and exotic epic told in broad strokes for art house aficionados, and he succeeds almost to a self-conscious fault.

The first season introduces the main characters, headed this year by Commander Jeffery Sinclair (Michael O'Hare) and Security Chief Michael Garibaldi (Jerry Doyle), and familiarizes the audience with the unique environment of a five-mile-long space station in the year 2257.The first episode, \"Midnight on the Firing Line,\" plays at a breathless pace, introducing Commander Susan Ivanova (Claudia Christian) and establishing the conflict between the Narn and Centauri races as represented by their ambassadors, G'Kar (Andreas Katsulas) and Londo Mollari (Peter Jurasik). Then follow several mediocre episodes that initially give the impression thatB5is aStar Trekclone afflicted with \"silly alien of the week\" syndrome. With \"And the Sky Full of Stars,\"B5really begins to hit its stride, Sinclair being forced to relive his mysterious experiences during the Earth-Minbari war. Filler shows such as \"TKO\" are notable only for being controversially violent, while the disappointing \"Grail\" points to writer-creator J. Michael Straczynski's fascination with Arthurian mythology. \"Signs and Portents\" introduces the sinister Mr. Morden (Ed Wasser) and offers the chilling first appearance of the Shadows, an ancient alien threat.B5hits warp speed with a run of exceptional episodes building to the season finale. The two-part \"Voice in the Wilderness\" has Mars breaking into open revolt against Earth and the discovery of a \"Great Machine\" on the dead world Epsilon 3. Referencing 1950s sci-fi classicForbidden Planet, the story leads to the superb  time-travel-based \"Babylon Squared.\" Season finale \"Chrysalis\" proves more than just the usual television cliffhanger, placing Minbari ambassador Delenn in conflict with her ruling Grey Council and forcing on her a decision that laid the groundwork forBabylon 5's eventually becoming a great love story.--Gary S.

{"description": "This first movie from the Discovery Channel favorite opens with a plot of international intrigue over a downed satellite, but within four minutes Steve Irwin is belly flopping after a baby croc on the outback floor. Steve and his nerves-of-steel sidekick wife, Terri, are asked to relocate a cattle-chomping crocodile before it's shot by a local rancher. This same reptile happened to swallow the intelligence-gathering device that fell to earth, and so begins the goofball premise of this lark of a movie. The feds believe the Irwins are appropriating their classified info, and the Irwins think they're running from poachers. Quibblers may object to Irwin's frequent interruptions to introduce a bird-eating spider or paw through croc dung, butCrocodile Hunterfans wouldn't have it any other way. This 89-minute film is rated PG for action violence/peril and mild language. But unless you consider \"crikey\" an obscenity, it's a safe bet for family viewing.

{"description": "Just as visual artists understand the relationship between positive and  negative space in their work, France's master filmmaker Henri-Georges Clouzot  (Diabolique) understood--and set about demonstrating viaThe Mystery  of Picasso--the relationship between creation and destruction in the  artistic process. In 1955, Clouzot teamed with his friend Pablo Picasso to  capture as many aspects of the brilliant painter's working methods as possible.  Clouzot innovatively placed the camera in front of Picasso while the latter  worked, thus capturing astonishing reverse images of brush strokes and  \"bleeding\" inks in volatile motion. The result is that Clouzot's film--the  screen, the frame--become Picasso's canvas, and we find ourselves inside his  prodigious genius as works of beauty spontaneously burst forth and are instantly  crushed beneath the weight of new images, new ideas. A viewer would be forgiven  if, more than once, he felt like screaming at such nonchalant carnage.--Tom  Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001CK7OLU", "B003WKQ46E", "B0041I97CO", "B001CK7OM4", "B002ZMZBIM", "B001BWYT4E", "B0043CT8GI", "B003ODIV10", "B00005KHJJ", "B0030T120A", "B003VTKZ8O", "B0026BTRUK", "B001O7R768", "B000WZAE7W", "B000YKYT2G", "B00BQXTDEO", "B004SIP7S0", "B005TTEG3O", "B000BYA4HY", "B003BR8MDQ", "B000AL72R8", "B00116GEJ8", "B008BWFP18", "B000FFJYCK", "B003MWHUMY", "B0001US61O", "B000GEIREQ", "B00007F8OA", "B000IHYXK8", "B003ELMR80", "B003ELMR8U", "B0062Z0PBQ", "B000FC2HJ0", "B000E3LCXC", "B00007F8OB", "B000NTPG84", "B0002V7KUU", "B0002JL9N6", "B0056G1ARU", "B009B8YZ8U", "B0041I97C4", "B00470MG06", "B0009U6XD4", "B0011V7PSW", "B004CJQVQC", "B000E3LCXW", "B000KN7C1W", "B0078G9RMQ", "B00005MKOP", "B000CCCZYA", "B008CYDE9K", "B0077PBPNM", "B002RB56WM", "0870709054", "B000092T3B", "B00008PHD1", "B00JVQ7QTM", "B0087HDEGA", "B00J5LXN2M", "B000053VAV", "B005LVO6QC", "B0006GANX2", "B00DVH21OM", "B000AV2GF6", "B007XF0XNO", "B000EULK64", "3791353640", "B0043CT8GS", "0847844471", "B005DNDUEW", "B001URA63I", "B00IMRL2AA", "B0068CEGEA", "B0011ZJ5C2", "B0002V7NSY", "B00005A8TV", "B000E3LCY6", "B003L16F5Y", "1582346062", "B004RV719G", "0544442784", "B0031REQKE", "B002U6DVQ2", "3791353675", "B00009P1ML", "B00GPPXOTS", "B0001V6ZJ8", "1844489558", "3791353071", "B00366BBU8", "3791352202", "B0000714A6", "B00BR0SF8G", "B00005R87F", "B000051YMN", "B000GFRI6I", "B000K2UEDG", "026258008X", "0571220185", "080509590X"], "bought_together": ["B003WKQ46E", "B001CK7OLU"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001CK7OLU", "B003WKQ46E", "B0030T120A", "B0041I97CO"]}, "price": 62.0, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 171957}, "asin": "B00007ELEI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GP2KM0K5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Mystery of Picasso"}

{"description": "Producer Gerry Anderson is something of a legend in his native England,  based primarily on the popular TV seriesThunderbirds, its various  spinoffs, and this, its 1962-'63 predecessor. All were produced in  \"Supermarionation\"; i.e., they're puppet shows--not especially sophisticated  ones (to say the least), but ones that many viewers seemed to adore. This  five-disc boxed set contains all 39 episodes ofFireball XL5, totaling nearly  17 hours (plus extras).The stories concern the efforts of captain-hero Steve Zodiac and his crew  (including Steve's love interest and a talkative robot, voiced respectively by  Anderson's then-wife Sylvia and Anderson himself; the pair were also cowriters)  to protect \"Sector 25\" of the solar system from alien invasion. They battle  killer rays and alien criminals, visit mysterious planets, and escape from all  manner of perilous circumstances... they use ray guns and fly around with  \"thrust packs\" and on \"jetmobiles\" (reducing the need for walking, which puppets  don't do so well)... in other words, typical sci-fi fare. But while the  animation is laughable (little attempt was made to disguise the strings that  hold up puppets and props alike) and the effects primitive, there's no denying  the show's campy charm (indeed, people who study such things consider it to be  an important influence on the sci-fi genre in general). Is it a bit too much of  a good thing? Probably not for anyone willing to make the investment. DVD extras  include photos, a couple of featurettes, and audio commentary on two episodes  (voice actor David Graham on \"The Doomed Planet\" and director Alan Pattillo on  \"Space City Special\").--Sam Graham", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00008PHCX", "B000P6R5T8", "B000065Q9A", "B00009RXJ0", "B0000AZKJ8", "B00LNBQ8SI", "B0000TWNB0", "B00012QLGE", "B000059RNA", "B00404ME2E", "B00F3L8P26", "B00020X85C", "B00020X85M", "B0062KMDWU", "B0001MZ7J6", "B001HUHBBS", "B00IS6WQ2S", "B00G5N6C8U", "B000BOH8Z0", "B00JEZWRE4", "B00IF0KAYS", "B000OY9V7A", "B003H9LIU2", "B005BYBZQ8", "B00E5G03I4", "B00FEOYY8G", "B00CDEJRDC", "B00I462XF2", "B000AOEMU0", "B00005JMZA", "B001DW2BG0", "B000JLTRHW", "B00022PZ56", "B00553KAK2", "B0000524FK", "B00ISSF7S6", "B005EDVLE2", "B00I099JO6", "B007AVO1MU", "B00I4X8KU2", "B00AIA884W", "B00HMOW9YM", "B00D9EJFZA", "B000BCCAEQ", "B0012EBV88", "B000BQ7JVG", "B0029WGIDK", "B009OE2ODY", "B008N8A3JE", "B000EXDS2A", "B005BUA1CQ", "B002KAIW44", "B005EXA87S", "B00J2PQZEY", "B000AOEMUA", "B0007YMWFK", "B00AJXO3ZQ", "B009OE2O3Y", "B00005JOJP", "B0012EBV8I", "B005TMXXX0", "B005TMY00K", "B0007TKH66", "B009OE2O2A", "B006LPHY6G", "B00GX7D5G0", "B003KSO3QQ", "B0096W46VW", "B009OE2O0C", "B002DQSKLU", "B00FM4S5O2", "B008MIYKS0", "B00FMGPVCO", "B0016B6ZJW", "B000HEWEJ4", "B000ZBEOHY", "B005FQ2H8W", "B0018BDDFE", "B00C6ACWLC", "B0000524FJ", "B003VJTGNE", "B00DRQETNI", "B001B0H7DG", "B000KLQUT4", "B000W4KT9G", "B0009UC80Q", "B000PAAJZG", "B004CZZZQI", "B003BLPEHE", "B003NHOJGS", "B005E7SFDI", "B001B0H7D6", "B002DUJ9Q6", "B0038AN1WI", "B003NOGNQU", "B005HIBWBG", "B006WDWBK6", "B002LIZWS4", "B001SGN1JM", "B000YENUOK"], "bought_together": ["B00008PHCX", "B000P6R5T8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000P6R5T8", "B00020X85C", "B00020X85M", "B00008PHCX"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 58812}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 35.23, "brand": "A&amp;E", "asin": "B00007J6DN", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510RVV6D9HL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Fireball XL5 - The Complete Series"}
{"description": "Anyone who fantasizes about becoming a porn star should seePorn Star:  The Legend of Ron Jeremy, a cheerful documentary that paints a sympathetic  but clear-eyed portrait of the most successful male porn star of all time.  Through remarkably frank interviews with the man himself and a variety of  friends and associates (including actresses, rival actors, and directors; porn  moguls like Larry Flynt and Al Goldstein; and, most surprisingly, Jeremy's own  family), Ron Jeremy emerges as a likeable but self-obsessed guy whose insatiable  drive for fame and success is also a struggle to overcome loneliness and a lack  of self-worth. Not that anyone's going to feel too sorry for a man who gets paid  to have sex, but Jeremy's honesty and sense of humor deserve some respect. And  despite all the flesh on display,Porn Staris more matter-of-fact than  titillating, taking in its subject with a sociological distance.--Bret  Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000777I2O", "B00005UW9L", "B00007CVSO", "B0002I84I0", "B000FBFZ2C", "B000077VR2"], "bought_together": ["B000777I2O"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0060840838", "B00007JZXT"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 236381}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 13.99, "brand": "NEW VIDEO GROUP", "asin": "B00007JZXS", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51TP1MJMH6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Porn Star - The Legend of Ron Jeremy (Uncut &amp; Unrated Edition)"}
{"description": "In 1966-67, with 100,000 meters of black-and-white film and freedom to shoot without a script, director Vilgot Sj&#xF6;man created a motion picture so rangy and multilayered that it became two separate, overlapping movies released a year apart:I Am Curious YellowandI Am Curious Blue.  Those are the colors of the Swedish flag, and   Sj&#xF6;man's film tapped into the political, social, and psychosexual condition of his nation on the eve of worldwide cultural revolution.It also became a envelope-pushing event in the history of sex in the cinema.  A feisty, rather zaftig actress-activist named Lena Nyman played a radical activist named Lena Nyman who, in between interviewing her fellow Swedes about everything from gender inequities to the morality of vacationing in Franco's Spain, spent lots of raunchy time in bed (and elsewhere).  The copious frontal nudity and a glimpse of oral-genital contact ensured an epic court battle in America, andI Am Curious Yellowbecame a must-see conversation piece.Decades later, it all seems not only fresher than it did then but oddly tender, even sweet.  Sj&#xF6;man, 42 years old to Nyman's 22, cast himself as her lover (which he was) as well as her director, and the film is occasionally \"interrupted\" by its own filming.  Sj&#xF6;man/\"Sj&#xF6;man\" has to watch Lena/\"Lena\" doing some very intimate things with costar B&#xF6;rje Ahlstedt.  B&#xF6;rje is playing a car salesman, but also playing \"himself\" as an actor sometimes intriguing against his director with \"Lena\"--not \"Lena the activist\" but \"Lena the actress,\" both of whom Lena the actress-for-real is playing.  The Pirandellianism is witty, raw, and lingeringly ambiguous.  And now DVD adds another layer if you happen to watch with the commentary track engaged and listen to the seventysomething Sj&#xF6;man, still musing wryly on the radical fusion of film and life at whose creation he was present.--Richard T.

{"description": "With the original conspiracy plot arc having fallen into a muddle of  loose ends, once-hungry lead actors on the verge of big-screen careers and  making demands for more time off or shots at writing and directing, and the  initial wish list of monsters-of-the-week long exhausted, it's a miracle that by  its seventh seasonThe X-Fileswas still making its airdates, let alone  managing something pretty good every other show and something outstanding at  least once every four episodes.

Coyote-style doom for anyone who crosses him; \"The Amazing Maleeni,\" guest-starring  Ricky Jay in a rare nonfantastic crime story about a feud between stage  magicians that turns out to be a cover for a heist; \"X-Cops,\" a brilliant skit  on the TV docusoapCopswith Mulder and Scully caught on camera as they  track an apparent werewolf in Los Angeles (season-best acting from David  Duchovny and Gillian Anderson); \"Theef,\" a complex revenge drama with gaunt  Billy Drago as a hillbilly medicine man stalking a slick doctor; \"Brand X,\" a  horror-comic tale of corruption in the tobacco industry; \"Hollywood AD\" (written  and directed by Duchovny), in which Tea Leoni (Duchovny's wife) and Garry  Shandling are cast as Scully and Mulder in a crass movie version of a real-life  X-file; and \"Je Souhaite,\" a deadpan comedy about a wry, cynical genie at the  mercy of trailer-trash masters who haven't an idea what to wish for.--Kim  Newman", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000EXDS3E", "B000CNE0TC", "B000EXDS3Y", "B000CNE0T2", "B000CNE0SS", "B000BOH990", "B000BOH98G", "B000BOH986", "B0007X7044", "B001FACH7S", "B001G7PSZI", "B0006UEVUE", "B001G7PT4I", "B001CY5N00", "B001G7PSSK", "B003V1IU3O", "B000244E2O", "B000SULWKO", "B0009X76XW", "B001G0MFIS", "B00465I156", "B00FXW9664", "B001CQONKY", "B000HEVZ94", "B000UX6TIE", "B0002CX1M0", "B000E1MXWS", "B00IWTVDUW", "B000P0J0BU", "1933784725", "B00013D54Y", "B001MVWRNE", "B000H7JCGY", "B003L77GWE", "B004X60QE2", "B000CQM4YM", "B000F8O2P6", "B000A88EU0", "B001C4CI8U", "B004BZ5AHI", "B00008972G", "B000Q6GUW0", "B000NOIX66", "B00GTZWZH6", "B005FISBTO", "B000F8O2PG", "B00KHA9BQ2", "B000FFJYC0", "B002KQ6UE2", "B003FSTN7A", "B00BM2JVAA", "B0019N95IK", "B000F8O2OM", "B00HUPC5X8", "B000006OAQ", "B009LDD5XQ", "B002KQ6UDS", "B00H57HOSC", "B00361XWFK", "B001FB4W0C", "B00361XWF0", "B000FGGE7C", "B00361XWFA", "B000002N8O", "B00CHZ236K", "B000XJD3K2", "B001HUHBBS", "B002GP7ZW8", "1613779445", "B0025KVNOU", "B003FSTN5M", "B002GP7ZVY", "B000F8O2PQ", "B0009CTV4U", "B006TBYC76", "B001DXS4DI", "B000BF0C8E", "B0002NY8GW", "6303961614", "B002BWP2IK", "B0007UDCX0", "B00J3QG6Y6", "B002GP7ZVO", "B0001906X6", "B0002DB5N6", "B007AFC0W4", "6305767866", "B000F8O2OW", "B000667HBS", "B001B7CNWY", "B00A2XQTAU", "B002OOWL3E", "B0030E5PYO", "B000ATQYWY", "B000FOPPBA", "B0097C046W", "B00EVU3S0E", "B00FWMVVKY", "B000HWZ4HU", "B00EIXWW2O"], "bought_together": ["B000CNE0TC", "B000EXDS3E"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000BOH990", "B000CNE0SS", "B000CNE0T2", "B000CNE0TC"]}, "price": 44.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 228191}, "asin": "B000089RT0", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51S6VFV7GDL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The X-Files - The Complete Seventh Season"}
{"description": "Even before it premiered on September 13, 1977 (Tuesdays at 9:30 pm on ABC),Soapwas mired in controversy (including 32,000 letters of protest) and primed to make television history. Conceived as a primetime satire of daytime melodramas, this groundbreaking series toppled many of the TV taboos that remained afterAll in the FamilyandM*A*S*H, openly addressing a variety of risky topics (homosexuality, infidelity, impotence, familial murder) with a deft combination of irreverent wit, wacky slapstick, supreme stupidity, and--key to its success--engaging drama from characters you could really care about, regardless of their rampant quirks and foibles.As a friendly announcer informs us, \"this is the story of two sisters\" in suburban Connecticut--wealthy dimwit Jessica Tate (Katherine Helmond) and blue-collar housewife Mary Campbell (Cathryn Damon)--whose class-divided families are bound by enough scandalous secrets to make each of these 25 episodes (all written by creator-producer Susan Harris and directed by sitcom veteran Jay Sandrich) a polished gem of half-hour comedy. The integration of plot and character is flawless, and dirty laundry was rarely this absurd: Jessica's cheating on her cheating husband (Robert Mandan, the show's underrated lynchpin); stepson Jodie (Billy Crystal) is (gasp!) openly gay, and brother Danny (Ted Wass) has Mafia connections; daughter Corrine (Diana Canova) is in love with a priest; Mary's husband Burt (manic genius Richard Mulligan) is a would-be killer who thinks he's invisible; and all of them are suspects in a murder case that fuels the season's cliffhanger finale.This is ensemble comedy at its finest, and is it any wonder Robert Guillaume--as the Tates' insolent servant Benson--got his own spin-off sitcom in 1979? His line readings (such as \"You wantmeto get that?\" when the doorbell rings) are instant classics, and while Helmond tops the cast with her inimitable brand of idiocy, there's not a weak link in the entire cast. All those protesting prudes fought a futile battle:Soapwas never naughty without purpose (indeed, the show possesses subtle integrity) and a large and loyal audience propelled it to even crazier heights in subsequent seasons. (Technical note: Given the shortcomings of 25-year-old videotape, with minor glitches and color variations, these episodes look and sound remarkably good.)--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00361XWF0", "B00361XWFA", "B00361XWFK", "B000Q6GUJS", "B000MEYKA0", "B00008EY6N", "B0002NY8R6", "B0006N2EZK", "B001OXLGK0", "B000YKYT1M", "B00LMKKY2Q", "B000MXPE6U", "B002PQ7JR4", "B0006N2EZA", "B0006Q93BU", "B000YGGNGK", "B0001NBNIY", "B000MGTQ6G", "B00ESZZOM2", "B0007Y08JW", "B0002RQ3MU", "B000FTC1GW", "B0025KVNOU", "B004J713KQ", "B0000DFZ5O", "B000A9QKSM", "B00HNGC56G", "B00005JLIC", "B000A0GOP0", "B000EQ46HI", "B00EQ2KU7G", "B00FM4S7P4", "B000ATQYWY", "B00005JLIB", "B000MGBSH6", "B0006IUDYY", "B000A0GXGK", "B00008EYBH", "B00IFK7ONI", "B005BUA1JY", "B00005JNHU", "B00HRUQB5O", "B0016MJ73M", "B00005JOXR", "B0002I837M", "B00GLT2SOA", "B000JLQPYK", "B000ASDFIG", "B0000E32X2", "B000FFJ8BM", "B00004RE45", "B002WQ799U", "B000CNE0SS", "B000KB4898", "B000TGURZ8", "B00005AWQV", "B000GTLB6C", "B000E1MXWI", "B00008WJEZ", "B00008NV4G", "B0009X7BF0", "1593936877", "B0009ML1Z2", "B00A33J8FM", "B00GOC74QG", "B0058EE6NK", "B00D2UMHB0", "B00005JO3P", "B001D2WUDE", "B00005JNHT", "B00441GYXS", "B001HUHBC2", "B0025VKX04", "B000LC4Z8K", "B000N6UF10", "B000068V9Y", "B0001907BW", "B00DJYK1XU", "B001O4KBNM", "B000FVQLIO", "B00BM2JVAA", "B00E1HIWXU", "B0017W22LK", "B00CPEK3OM", "B001LRL4Y2", "B0009X7BEG", "B00006J6XH", "B00006J6XI", "B001OXLGIM", "B0002PYTD2", "B0002MK61E", "B003JHXS5A", "B00005U2KS", "B0055CP9P4", "B003INBNV6", "B000G6BLY2", "B000R7I3YG", "B005ZVIMUE", "B000UX6TLG", "B00008PHCZ"], "bought_together": ["B00361XWF0", "B00361XWFA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00361XWFA", "B00361XWFK", "B0016MJ73M", "B00361XWF0"]}, "price": 19.88, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 79039}, "asin": "B00008EY5S", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51PWYDTTVXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Soap - The Complete First Season"}

{"description": "The eighth season ofThe X-Fileswill always be remembered as the year of brave decisions. David Duchovny's increasing dissatisfaction with the role meant he'd only appear in a few episodes. The solution? Enter Agent John Doggett (Robert Patrick) who basically stole the show within his first two minutes of screen time (and watch out for severalTerminator 2in-jokes too!). Scully (Gillian Anderson) switched roles to being the believer alongside Doggett's skeptic in a year that was more reliant on the background story arc than ever before. Her pregnancy remained at the foreground, while a more prominent Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) joined in a hunt for the abducted Mulder that drew upon the black oil, cloning, and bounty-hunting aspects of the convoluted alien conspiracy story. A distinct lack of guest stars or writers indicated maturity beyond the need for ratings stunts: dedicated fans were pleased to see sinister Krycek, the reliable Lone Gunmen, and the return of the show's very first abductee. The real strengths of the season came from new characters, including alternative female role model Special Agent Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish), and some terrific standalone episodes. Investigations covered a man going backward in time, deaths aboard an oil rig, a contagion in the Boston subway tunnels, and creatures resembling bats and slugs. Agent Leyla Harrison (named after anX-Filesfan who died of cancer) got to ask all the petty questions regular viewers want to know themselves. With season 9 promised to be the last, this year was a remarkable achievement so late in a show's life.--Paul Tonks", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000EXDS3Y", "B000EXDS34", "B000CNE0TC", "B000CNE0T2", "B000CNE0SS", "B000BOH990", "B000BOH98G", "B000BOH986", "B0007X7044", "B001FACH7S", "B001G7PSZI", "B0006UEVUE", "B001G7PT4I", "B001CY5N00", "B003V1IU3O", "B001G7PSSK", "B000244E2O", "B001G0MFIS", "B00KC57IWG", "B00465I156", "B0009X76XW", "B001CQONKY", "B00FXW9664", "B000UX6TIE", "B000SULWKO", "B001MVWRNE", "B003FSTN5M", "B0002CX1M0", "B00IWTVDUW", "B00GTZWZH6", "B006LG74RE", "B004X60QE2", "B000063V8R", "B00064VQXA", "1613777515", "1933784725", "B009LDD5XQ", "B000CQM4YM", "B0070DERD6", "B00129W6LE", "B0007UDCX0", "B001HUHBBS", "B000F8O2PG", "B00DYQ1GBE", "B001MVWRMU", "B00005Y1NF", "B005CFC04W", "B0036EH3X4", "B0019N95IK", "B00AGKHBZ6", "B000FGGE7C", "B00133QNSG", "B00005JM3A", "B002BWP2IK", "B000H7JCGY", "B001MVWRN4", "B003L77GWE", "B000AQ68X2", "B006TBYC76", "B001DXS4DI", "B00008972G", "1613777183", "6305767866", "B000B8I9ZO", "B000002N8O", "B00CHZ236K", "B0009NZ2RE", "B001C4CI8U", "B00022FWEU", "B000P0J0BU", "B000A88EU0", "B000W4KT9G", "B007STBUHI", "1613779445", "0783225725", "B00GX7D5JW", "B0009X7646", "B001AQR39O", "B000H1RFXM", "B00J5JSV1W", "B000B8IA08", "B008LCRABQ", "B000Q6GUW0", "B0057FGD3Q", "B003YF9Q08", "B00IQ8TT82", "B000O77SMW", "B000FBH3WM", "B000NDEXKW", "B009NH6AOQ", "6303961614", "B005FISBTO", "B008LCRAC0", "B000NOIX66", "B001L5SRJE", "B00J2R3W52", "B0002NY8GW", "B003R0MEZO", "B00BM2JVAA", "B00BTYPW7C"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000CNE0TC", "B000CNE0SS", "B000BOH990", "B000CNE0T2"]}, "price": 1.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 72854}, "asin": "B00008YGRY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51N2NNAHHBL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The X-Files - The Complete Eighth Season"}

(\"There needs to be a teenage driver's lane lined with tires and mattresses.\") Main event champ Jeff Foxworthy offers fresh material about the act of ice-fishing as an out-of-body experience for fish, describes the bizarre sight of a leaf blower among items confiscated by airport security and, of course, renders his trademark re-re-re-definitions of what constitutes a redneck (\"a glorious absence of sophistication\").

{"description": "A 26-episode World War II documentary,Victory at Seais one of the most important series in the history of television. Made in 1952, the show was a huge success, winning many major awards and even spawning albums featuring the orchestral score by Richard Rodgers, best known for his musicals with Lorenz Hart and Oscar Hammerstein II. Produced with the full cooperation of the U.S. Navy, each 26-minute program consists of black-and-white wartime film set to a narration by Leonard Graves. The two years leading up to America's entry into the war are dismissed in episode one, while the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor gets a show of its own, the raid depicted in a brilliantly edited montage that almost certainly contains \"docu-drama\" footage. Each episode contains at least one powerful stand-alone sequence in the tradition of Serge Eisenstein (Battleship Potemkin), these action-suspense set-pieces giving the programs an urgent, surprisingly modern feel. Indeed, the emphasis is at least as much on entertainment as information, the factual content delivered in poetic narration, the score transforming the war into a more than usually serious Hollywood adventure. The documentaries are nothing if not wide-ranging, covering parts of the land war despite the title, and including everything from the Atlantic convoys and U-boat \"Wolfpacks\" to war in Alaska, the South Atlantic, and the Far East, the Pacific War, and the Fall of Japan. There is an attempt to include other nations--certainly the D-Day episode acknowledges the British far more thanSaving Private Ryan--but inevitably the focus is on America's war.  The very dated narration gives a fascinating insight into how America saw WWII in the early 1950s, while the dynamic cutting and often genuinely remarkable wartime footage makeVictory at Seastill gripping today. Twenty years later, Granada'sThe World at Warwould become the definitive television WWII history, but this release offers a unique opportunity to see a series of great importance from the very early days of television.--Gary S.

{"description": "After the intense \"Sonny Steelgrave\" arc of first-season episodes, the producers ofWiseguyfaced the challenge of topping themselves, and they did it by casting a relatively unknown New York stage actor named Kevin Spacey, who proceeded to chew up the scenery as only a future Oscar&#xAE;-winner could. But Spacey's not the only reason for the giddy success of the \"Mel Profitt\" arc, which finds OCB agent Vinnie Terranova (Ken Wahl) teaming up with sociopathic assassin Roger Lococco (William Russ) in an effort to infiltrate the global drugs-and-guns empire of the Proffitt siblings Mel (Spacey), a \"manic-depressive genius with acute paranoia,\" and his codependent sister Susan (Joan Severance), who keeps her incestuously devoted brother happy by injecting home-brewed narcotics between his toes (hence giving Spacey his trademark line, \"Only the toes knows!\").TV audiences in 1988 had never seen such a twisted sibling relationship, and there's plenty of eccentric chemistry between Spacey and then-newcomer Severance, who later developed a loyal male following as a B-movie sexpot. Completing their triangle of terror is Russ, playing Lococco as a tormented Vietnam vet with a massive chip on his shoulder, luring Vinnie into a life of luxury and lethal behavior, thus complicating matters considerably for Vinnie's covert handlers McPike (Jonathan Banks) and Lifeguard (Jim Byrnes), who grow increasingly worried as Vinnie gains Mel Profitt's hard-won trust. The quality of these 12 episodes remains consistently high as the Profitts reach \"psychotic critical mass,\" leading to Mafia connections and a new direction for Vinnie's loving mother (well-played by Elsa Raven). Through it all, Wahl (who proves himself a man of few words in a sparse one-episode commentary) maintains his strong presence as a leading man, generously allowing Spacey's rising star to shine.Wiseguystill had some highlights in its future, but the \"Mel Profitt\" arc represents the series at its best.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B0030VANJO", "B002DHACTC", "B0016APVUW", "B00008977D", "B002VWNICC", "B00005JKIS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0030VANJO", "B002DHACTC", "B005FQ2HBO"]}, "price": 14.83, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 254284}, "asin": "B0000AZKKN", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41EGYZ9Q06L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Wiseguy - Mel Profitt Arc (Season 1 Part 2)"}

{"description": "When Mary Rodgers, daughter of the composer Richard Rodgers, was reported as saying she never wanted to see anotherOklahoma!, it was her way of paying the highest tribute to Trevor Nunn's production at the Royal National Theatre which was subsequently taken into the studio and filmed. The camera follows the playgoers into the auditorium of the Olivier where in their company we watch the show and applaud thenumbersas the real thing. Nunn treats Rodgers and Hammerstein's first collaboration with the utmost seriousness, restoring the full text so that it comes across as a drama indebted to Eugene O'Neill. AlthoughOklahoma!unfolds at a leisurely pace, it is extraordinary how one is drawn into the drama under Nunn's direction.There's seldom a wish for true locations as the pace picks up and we move into the claustrophobic company of Judd Fry in his riveting encounter with the cowboy Curly. The close-up camera work affords an experience the theatre can't bring and also pays handsome dividends in appreciating Susan Stroman's intricate and lively choreography. Her dancers are a fine team, notably Jimmy Johnston who is outstanding as Will Parker leading the Kansas City ensemble. Hugh Jackman (X-Men) as Curly matches him in vocal prowess and looks, and Shuler Hensley sings the tricky role of Judd Fry very well. It's harder to place Peter Polycarpou's Pedlar, a considerably larger role than in thefilm version, whose accent strays from London's East End to the plains of Europe. Maureen Lipman, rightly deemed the lynchpin of the musical by Nunn, is a joy to watch as Aunt Eller. Laurey (Josefina Gabrielle) and Ado Annie (Vicki Simon) are good but not special. Aside from an abrupt start to Act Two and the occasional voice off microphone, the production sounds good with a larger orchestra present than in the theatre.

{"description": "Partly inspired by 1948'sThe Big Clockand its nominal 1987 remakeNo Way Out, the Denzel Washington thrillerOut of Timeis quite enjoyable if you ignore its implausible plotting. Like those earlier films, this reunion of Washington and hisDevil in a Blue Dressdirector Carl Franklin is about a man--in this case the police chief (Washington) of sleepy Banyan Key, Florida--who falls into a trap set by others, sinks into legal quicksand of his own making, and must race the clock to extricate himself from a series of incriminating setbacks. The Florida setting adds welcome character to the potboiler plot, and Washington's screen-cred makes it easy to overlook the absurdities of rookie writer David Collard's screenplay. Eva Mendes is sharp and sensible as Washington's estranged wife (do you think they'll reconcile for a happy ending?), and the talented John Billingsley--whose portrayal of \"Dr. Phlox\" on TV'sEnterpriseis vastly underrated--is a constant delight as Washington's medical examiner, beer buddy and wily co-conspirator. It's hardly a classic, butOut of Timegoes well with a big tub of popcorn.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JPD0", "B000GFLKF8", "B00005JN0W", "B000244GCC", "B002LMV7R0", "6304884400", "B002VWNIEA", "B00005JKWX", "B000OT6V0K", "B005LAIGRS", "0783240295", "B0050MB4OO", "6304765258", "B00BTYOYG2", "B002ZG99TA", "B00005JA9F", "B0006210ZG", "B0000542CJ", "078324228X", "0767818075", "B002CPMB9O", "B002ZG997C", "B00AFEXRME", "B00441GZ1Y", "B002GHHHN8", "B00096S49Y", "B000N60HAO", "B00BEIYN9Q", "B005LAIGLE", "B002AT8K9W", "B00005JLRZ", "B00125WAWS", "B003BV8I3Q", "B0001VTPUO", "B008E70EES", "B0013J55B6", "B0007KZQAM", "B001JV5AZE", "B002O3Z4WK", "0800141806", "B000F8DV1M", "B002NZK5UU", "B00AEFXT1S", "B002AT8KAG", "B00BB67UNW", "B00J5G1P2W", "B002DU39GW", "B000G5SILC", "B00441GYXI", "0767810872", "B000ZS8GWQ", "B008FCX2D2", "B00AEBB86A", "B00008EYA5", "B00DZP1C2W", "B001UV4XRY", "0790730979", "6305428115", "0790736411", "6305161933", "B0006GAI5U", "B00BEIYHO2", "B008B9JTLI", "0783229402", "B001KRVLCI", "B003L20IG0", "B008JFUNKU", "B00AEBB8LA", "B00JA3RVG4", "B000VG66XS", "B0006GANOQ", "B00009L1TA", "B000R4SMCW", "B005OK721G", "B000EGDB10", "B00HEPC0TS", "B001L57ZYM", "B000069HZP", "B000P0J0EM", "B00007AJG1", "B00015YVDG", "6305505802", "B00005JMWP", "B004EPYZP8", "B00AEFXX9Q", "B000RO9Q7W", "B000244GCW", "B007EQR0D8", "B00J2MPZQG", "B00005JN0T", "B000QXDCLU", "B000P0I4O4", "B00005JNQA", "B005FUTBWS", "B00005JKQS", "0790742004", "B005YFGJFG", "B0002J4X2K", "B000N3SRO0", "B00013RC66"], "bought_together": ["B00005JPD0", "B00005JN0W"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005JN0W", "B00005JKWX", "B00005JPD0", "B000GFLKF8"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 29468}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.98, "brand": "Mgm/Ua Studios", "asin": "B0000VJG72", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51bhUc7kE0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Out of Time"}

{"description": "The compellingCoyote Waitsis based on one of the Leaphorn and Chee mystery novels by Tony Hillerman (all three have been adapted for television), concerning a partnership, of sorts, between an experienced Navajo detective, Joe Leaphorn (Wes Studi), and a young reservation cop, Jim Chee (Adam Beach). When the latter's colleague and friend ends up shot to death and left to burn in a fiery car, Chee takes time off to evaluate whether he should become a healer instead of a lawman. Either way, he can't proceed without getting to the bottom of the killing and proving or disproving his own original assumption that the murderer is a shaman he found drunk and in possession of a gun near the crime.  Working the case from a different angle is Leaphorn, who finds a link between the shaman and a missing university professor on the trail of a major historical find. Beach and Studi are terrific, though the story doesn't bring them together, in the same space, very often. (The two characters do most of their communicating by phone.) Familiar faces in the supporting cast include Gary Farmer (Dead Man), Keith Carradine (Deadwood), and Graham Greene (Dances with Wolves). Sheila Tousey is outstanding in her recurring role as Emma Leaphorn, Joe's wise, no-nonsense wife.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000V2IOXC", "B000AXWHP8", "B0000JCFN6", "B0000D0YWJ", "B003Y7F1OG", "B00019330O", "B000087F0X", "B000UL61KW", "B0046ZYEU2", "B0001FVDI2", "6305428417", "B001N5BDX4", "0767812182", "0062270486", "B001PSUM9K", "B00CLH09JM", "B00005OSJN", "B000AGTPVY", "B0025Z4Q3U", "B000A2WA9C", "B0008FXSSS", "B001AR0D54", "0061374296", "0062018027", "B0001I55YW", "0062018043", "0061967815", "0061808377", "0061967831", "B001UW59JO", "0061967785", "1607811375", "B0007R8E54", "B00CS7GYF8", "B007PXYWNQ", "B00003L9BB", "B000UVV274", "0061967823", "0061808393", "B003XMKU48", "0060815116", "0061967807", "1482393182", "B0002S65WC", "0061967769", "0062018116", "0061808385", "B0001FGBWU", "1492358444", "B000AQ6A9E", "0767817672", "0061808407", "0061967793", "B0007UDC80", "0061808369", "B00006RG78", "B0041518AQ", "0061967777", "B00337DRGQ", "B00JJRLFTU", "0061808350", "B00FWSWORC", "B004UOHNIY", "B0009S4II8", "B009B6XJVQ", "B00CDWQNMW", "B00HUAGYF8", "B007ZXW3LY", "B00EIXWW2O", "0062270494", "B000BQ7J98", "0060544481", "B0037ZHPYY", "B009DS31ZG", "B00C12ZISE", "0060505869", "B00C68SK24", "B0074JOCTU", "B00GHH9I62", "B005J7K9BO", "B008RO6PJQ", "B002JDWNSS", "B000ELJ3E4", "B005HIBWPM", "B000FBFZ18", "B002K0WBVE", "B00IBKXQJS", "0060815094", "B009DS6YGO", "B00GD7UO6E", "B00D49YDR0", "0060815078", "B00A92MD8G", "B004X9LNAU", "B00CLB7CFM", "B00028G7IO", "0060820780", "B00J3M54AW", "B002DHACT2"], "bought_together": ["B000V2IOXC", "B000AXWHP8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002IFSA8O", "B0000JCFN6", "B000AXWHP8", "B000V2IOXC"]}, "price": 18.91, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 36974}, "asin": "B00015YVPO", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51CN5B14S9L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Mystery!

{"description": "Like the movie, the DVD extras are smarter and a lot more entertaining than your average flick. The making-of feature (\"Lessons Learned\") has the usual behind-the-scenes banter but Jack Black is in fine form--that is, something special--interviewing as much as being interviewed about the making of the film. His unique pitch to Led Zeppelin to use their song is alone worth the price of the DVD. Black is more his maniacal self and a bit more grating in MTV's Diary segment, but his commentary track with director Richard Linklater is as insightful as it is funny. Ok, it's a lot more funny, but entertaining throughout. The commentary track featuring just the kid actors is less so, but any preteen would love listening to it. To top it off, the DVD-ROM has Dewey Finn's instantly famous blackboard history of rock. You can drill down to the bands mentioned and get a brief history of each.

{"description": "After afirst seasonmade controversial by the mere presence of openly gay  characters,Will & Gracereturned triumphantly with renewed  confidence and vigor. In their second season, sidekicks Jack and Karen  (the very, very funny Sean Hayes and Megan Mullally) are more snide and  gleefully obnoxious than ever; Will (Eric McCormack) has perfected his  prickly panache; and in particular Grace (Debra Messing) has entered a  whole new plane of sexy goofiness, diving even more headlong into physical  comedy--such as the episode when, in order to woo a high school crush, she  gets a water-padded bra that springs a leak. The writing has also become  tighter, grown more deft in its gay and pop culture references (which were  often self-conscious in the first season) and at juggling sustained  storylines, such as the Immigration department investigating Jack's  marriage to Karen's Salvadorian maid Rosario (Shelley Morrison), Grace and  Will struggling to become less emotionally incestuous, and Jack seeking  his biological father. The show excels at tackling emotional subjects  (like Will discovering that his father, who has accepted and even embraced  his homosexuality at home, has told his co-workers that Will is married to  Grace) with a sharp comic eye.Guest stars start to accumulate: Molly  Shannon returns, Sydney Pollack and Debbie Reynolds play Will's dad and  Grace's mom, Joan Collins appears as a rival designer, Neil Patrick Harris  (Doogie Howser, M.D.) plays the leader of a going-straight support  group, and Gregory Hines takes on a recurring role as Will's new boss, a  high-powered lawyer who seduces Grace.Will & Gracemixes superb  sitcom farce with sly sociopolitical commentary; the fusion is smart and  consistently entertaining.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00009Y3RW", "B0002I84FS", "B0009WFEEG", "B000G1R3A8", "B000NA78SE", "B000VZADPQ", "B001BNFR6M", "B000EWBKM6", "B000EXDRZI", "B00005JLEX", "B00GOC74QG", "B001MVYUSO", "B0001IN0T4", "B000AJJNJK", "B000I2J6VE", "B000EBGFQI", "B0007R4SWC", "B0009JQN6M", "B0002UE1WQ", "B003TNW03K", "B000A7Q1YC", "B00361XWF0", "B005BUA1GC", "B00127RAGM", "B0000TPA60", "B003R4ZMSQ", "B0000DFZ5O", "B000A7PKGW", "B000FVQLIO", "B00361XWEQ", "B0030ATZH6", "B00005JOHC", "B000068V9X", "B00000F5W8", "B005Z28M58", "B000C1VBAA", "B001O4KBNM", "B003TNW03A", "B003TNW030", "B000KGGIL4", "B0001NBNJ8", "B000RBA6CO", "B0012BS5XU", "B000BYA4I8", "B0007KTBJO", "B000TGJ82G", "B0018CWEXA", "B002N5N5KW", "B004ES6TBS", "B002OOWKYE", "B0000E32X2", "B0053O8A78", "B007C8RZYC", "B001QE99AQ", "B0077PTX0E", "B0018CWEYO", "B003L77GBU", "B008LCRA98", "B00382S9UA", "B00EQ2KU7G", "0307931900", "B000068CNX", "B000AJJNI6", "B0002W4SX6", "B000R9YLKY", "B00A2XQTVY", "B00AYVDUPW", "B003TNW02G", "B000Q6GUW0", "B005IA9JVI", "B00D2UMHB0", "B003F3NDP8", "B00HUQCA28", "B000G6BL88", "B001A4VH2U", "B000V86OKG", "B00DJYK1XU", "B00BUWD7Y8", "B001VPJYZK", "B0053O89WY", "B000P6YNSO", "B002LCOGBE", "B0012018OE", "B000Q6GUKW", "B004A8ZWWO", "B000EBGFPY", "B000EHSVMS", "B001FB4VXU", "B003QZSWRY", "B000W91RUG", "B00GLT2SOA", "B002KQ6UE2", "B006YGCEPS", "B000RO6JZO", "B000EHSVL4", "B000P6YNTI", "B000FFJYE8", "B000B5XOVQ"], "bought_together": ["B00009Y3RW", "B0002I84FS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00009Y3RW", "B002YBUX0K", "B0002I84FS", "B0009WFEEG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 16691}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 10.0, "brand": "Lions Gate", "asin": "B0001907BW", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/419EATZ4MTL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Will &amp; Grace - Season Two"}

{"description": "From Academy Award&#xAE;-winning director Bernardo Bertolucci (The Last Emperor, 1987), comes an erotic tale of three young film lovers brought together by their passion for movies -- and each other. When Isabelle and Theo (Eva Green, Louis Garrel) invite Matthew (Michael Pitt) to stay with them, what begins as a casual friendship ripens into a sensual voyage of discovery and desire in which nothing is off limits and anything is possible.

{"description": "It doesn't seem possible, but the second season ofSoapis even better than thefirst. Only the greatest primetime sitcoms achieve triple-threat genius: Casting, writing, and direction reached their zenith as the 1978-79 season began with a resolution to season 1's cliffhanger murder. Chester (Robert Mandan) loses his memory and wander out west while his ditzy wife Jessica (Katherine Helmond) enjoys a fling with the detective (new cast member John Byner) she'd hired to find Chester. Across town, the working-class Campbells have their own melodramas to contend with: Despite being gay, stepson Jodie (Billy Crystal) is an expectant father and moves in with pregnant Carol (Rebecca Balding), and later a lesbian roommate; Mary (Cathryn Damon) suspects Burt (Richard Mulligan) of having an affair; Corrine (Diana Canova) and ex-priest Tim (Sal Viscuso) have a baby that's demonically possessed; and Burt is abducted by aliens!Exorcisms and flying saucers might suggest desperation on the part of writer-creator Susan Harris, but the opposite is true: the controversy that plaguedSoap's first season had subsided (thanks to valiant defense by ABC President Fred Silverman), and Harris and Jay Sandrich (who directed 20 of these 22 episodes) were able to push their spoofy plots to even greater heights of absurdity without sacrificing the show's core integrity. Jimmy Baio (as Billy Tate) gets his moment to shine, and Robert Guillaume (as Benson) deservedly won an Emmy for Best Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series. Most impressively,Soapbuilt its madness upon a solid tragi-comic foundation, with risky shifts of tone and characters invested with surprising depth and compassion. The episodes are consistently full of classic scenes and side-splitting dialogue. In a 20-minute bonus featurette, Harris and coproducers Paul Witt and Tony Thomas reveal how luck, timing, talent, and network support brought the series to life. Simply put, it doesn't get any better than this.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00361XWFA", "B00361XWEQ", "B00361XWFK", "B000Q6GUJS", "B000MEYKA0", "B00008EY6N", "B00LMKKY2Q", "B0002NY8R6", "B0006Q93BU", "B000A0GOP0", "B002PQ7JR4", "B0006N2EZK", "B00HNGC56G", "B000FTC1GW", "B000MXPE6U", "B00ESZZOM2", "B0002PYTD2", "B000MGTQ6G", "B000YGGNGK", "B0025KVNOU", "B005BUA1JY", "B00HRUQB5O", "B0006N2EZA", "B001OXLGK0", "B000291Q3O", "B000EQ46HI", "B0011N19HI", "B000FFJ8BM", "B0000E32X2", "B000LC4Z8K", "B000CNE0SS", "B00EQ2KU7G", "B001RXDLZ0", "B000N6UF10", "B004J713KQ", "B000E33VYU", "B002WN8IR0", "B000FDFSH2", "B003XMKU0W", "B0006IUDYY", "B00004RE45", "B0001NBNIY", "B00006J6XI", "B000MGTQ6Q", "B00IFK7ONI", "B000EXDS02", "B003BGZ618", "B002AT8KBU", "1593936877", "B00GC2KI2U", "B000UX6TL6", "B001N26GSE", "B00000K3U3", "B000CNE0T2", "B00GHH9HW2", "B0007Y08JW", "B005CGI4EG", "B000EXDS34", "B000YKYT1M", "B0001BS3IE", "B000VNMMVG", "B00441GYXS", "B000GTLB6C", "B00DXLO0D6", "B001D2WUDE", "B00006J6XH", "B0016MJ73M", "B00FM4S7P4", "B000BOH990", "B005KK2FTO", "B000BOH98G", "B00D2UMHB0", "B00DJYK1XU", "B00008EYBH", "B000TD2KY2", "B000R7I3YG", "B002PQ7JQU", "B00065GX8C", "B001L1S1R6", "B005GZM0J8", "B000UX6TLG", "B00BM2JVAA", "B000HT38IK", "B002TQKL16", "B000MGBSH6", "B0000AQS8B", "B000BZISRQ", "B0001907BW", "B001BGS17Q", "B00008WJEZ", "B001JFKWE4", "B0001JXP2A", "B00D4ABT8K", "B00DXLO086", "B000AA4KQ0", "B0045HCJKS", "B0000798EY", "B000UAE7DQ", "B000G6BL7O", "B000BOH986"], "bought_together": ["B00361XWEQ", "B00361XWFA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00361XWEQ", "B00361XWFK", "B00361XWFA", "B0016MJ73M"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 102592}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 19.99, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B000255LJ8", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51VRQYPX54L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Soap - The Complete Second Season"}

{"description": "In the annals of acting, 2004 will be remembered as a banner year for Jamie Foxx. Before his acclaimed turns inCollateral, alongside Tom Cruise, andRay, the Ray Charles biopic, he produced and starred in this made-for-cable movie about former gangbanger Stan \"Tookie\" Williams. Directed by actor-turned-filmmaker Vondie Curtis Hall (Gridlock'd),Redemptiontracks Tookie's rise as co-founder of L.A.&#x92;s notorious Crips, fall to death-row inmate, and rise again to Nobel Prize Nominee. Tookie&#x92;s reminiscences to journalist Barbara Becnel (Lynn Whitfield), while he is on death row, frame the story. Virtually unrecognizable from his days onIn Living Color, a buffed-up, dreadlocked Foxx gives an effectively low-key performance, while Whitfield also shines in a less rewarding role.Redemptionmay not have the grandeur ofMalcolm XorThe Hurricane--and Tookie's transformation from man of violence to man of peace happens too quickly--but his story is just as inspirational.--Kathleen C.

Everybody, but especially new teacher Pearl Madison (Don Cheadle), wants to know why he killed the mentally challenged brother of girlfriend Becky (Jena Malone). After all, Leland seemed to genuinely like the kid. Leland is just as confused (and can't remember committing the act), but he reveals more and more clues as he gradually opens up to Pearl.

{"description": "The most famous episode in franchise history, \"The Trouble with Tribbles,\" is one of the highlights of the second season ofStar Trek: The Original Series.  A deserved classic, the humorous story centers on an ever-expanding mass of furry creatures that memorably rain themselves down on top of Captain Kirk (William Shatner) and into the middle of a Federation-Klingon showdown. It inspired one of the most memorable episodes in the spin-off seriesDeep Space Nine, \"Trial and Tribble-ations.\"  Also in the second season, the Vulcan culture of Mr. Spock (Leonard Nimoy) is fleshed out in \"Amok Time\" (in which Spock is faced with the possibility of killing his captain and friend) and \"Journey to Babel\" (introducing Spock's father, played by Mark Sarek, in what would turn out to be a long-recurring role).  A new character, navigator Pavel Chekov (Walter Koenig), was introduced; his Monkees haircut was intended to appeal to the younger audience, but he was also a Russian, which at the height of the cold war reflected Gene Roddenberry's optimistic vision of a more enlightened future.  Other social-commentary opportunities presented themselves in \"The Omega Glory,\" \"The Doomsday Machine,\" and \"Assignment: Earth,\" the last also one of those periodic opportunities to scrimp on the budget by time-traveling to an earlier version of Earth.  Another example was \"A Piece of the Action,\" a comic episode set in the Roaring Twenties and memorable for, among other things, Kirk's teaching a made-up card game called Fizzbin.  In other significant episodes, \"I, Mudd\" saw the return of the bounder from season 1, \"The Changeling\" was the original inspiration for the firstTrekfeature film a decade later, \"Wolf in the Fold\" (penned by the author ofPsycho) provides an example of the series' great writing, and \"Mirror, Mirror\" introduced the concept of the parallel universe inhabited by vicious, amoral counterparts of the regular crew, another theme later borrowed (more than once, and to good emotional effect) byDS9.Special features are a bit lighter than on theseason 1 set, but they do feature such contributors as Shatner, Nimoy, George Takei (Sulu), Koenig, Nichelle Nichols (Uhura), and editor-writer D.C. Fontana. Of chief interest are \"To Boldly Go,\" a 20-minute season recap; \" Kirk, Spock & Bones: The Great Trio,\" discussing the interplay among Kirk, Spock, and Dr. McCoy (DeForest Kelley); \"Star Trek's Divine Diva,\" shining the spotlight on the development of Nichols's character (she was originally considered to play Spock); and \"Writer's Notebook: D.C. Fontana,\" discussing her various roles in the series (she used her initials to avoid the anti-female bias in science fiction at the time).--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001DHXT3Y", "B000VDDDY6", "B0002JJBZO", "B000HEWEJ4", "B002I9Z8I0", "B0007TKH66", "B000063V8R", "B000RZIGVS", "B000063V8S", "B000AOEMXC", "B00005Y1NF", "B000063V8T", "B00BHWG1AI", "B00AZMFJYA", "B002I9Z8GM", "B00BHWG0DQ", "B000A6CLL0", "B00BHWG0CM", "B000127LW2", "B00005JLF5", "B0000UJL96", "B0009I7NGW", "B002I9Z8BM", "B000QGEB1W", "B00000IREA", "B000062XFG", "B00008972H", "B00062RCC6", "B00BHWG0G8", "B0001NBNFW", "B000QQJ3Q0", "B000VECAD0", "B002I9Z8AS", "B000SFJ4K4", "B002PHVHKI", "6305181721", "B00062IDLA", "B001A7GOCA", "B00008KA5A", "B00GX7D5G0", "1451621299", "B0044XV7AQ", "B0029B31HM", "B00GOC74YI", "B0001I55SS", "B000AOEMXM", "B000N6UF10", "B002MU4NLS", "B0000DC3VM", "B0013D8M4E", "B000QUEQ4U", "B002HWRYJE", "B000E6ESEY", "B00062IDCO", "B001MT7ZI8", "B002GOAGYI", "B001LM64VK", "B001DZOC78", "B0002WZTCA", "B00005JKHP", "B008HSK3PE", "B001TH16DI", "B000A9QKSM", "B003ZFUMP0", "B00BQK4YDC", "B000UZDO62", "B00BOM98PG", "B002VA59ZS", "B00008KA59", "B000QGE8II", "B006MFQ4DE", "B0006UEVTA", "B00096S47G", "B00158K0V0", "B001TH16CO", "B0009UC80Q", "B00AEFY3MC", "B00005LIRB", "B001FT4PEW", "B00BI3XZA0", "B0007CEXUY", "B000E3L7FK", "B000BF0C8E", "B004916TRE", "B00DB97LRC", "B00E3UN44W", "B00E5G03I4", "B00IF0KASY", "B004EXWGHY", "B0000AUHOH", "B000O599XU", "B00008KA58", "B005AMJ36U", "B00008YLVB", "B00008KA57", "B000BT96FA", "B004L9GMBC", "B00DXLO0D6", "B000A283AW", "B00096S48U"], "bought_together": ["B001DHXT3Y", "B000VDDDY6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001DHXT6G", "B000VDDDY6", "B002I9Z8I0", "B001DHXT3Y"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 43934}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 69.99, "brand": "", "asin": "B0002JJBZE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51yahpmpTCL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete Second Season"}
{"description": "Since its network debut in 1960,The Andy Griffith Showhas been a viewer favorite thanks to its folksy, nostalgic charm and memorable cast, both of which shine in this set featuring the series' debut season. Originally spun off from an episode ofMake Room for Daddy(both series shared producers Sheldon Leonard and Danny Thomas),The Andy Griffith Showcentered around the lives of small-town sheriff Andy Taylor (the marvelously dry Griffith), his son Opie (Ron Howard), cousin and deputy Barney Fife (multiple Emmy winner Don Knotts), and the other gentle eccentrics of Mayberry (which was based on Griffith's real hometown). But while other \"rural\" programs poked fun at its characters (The Real McCoys,The Beverly Hillbillies),The Andy Griffith Shownever stooped to stereotypes, preferring instead to draw its humor from the fine writing and cast, which counted Frances Bavier as Aunt Bee, Howard McNear as Floyd the Barber, and Hal Campbell as Mayberry's benevolent drunk, Otis, among the first season ensemble. All 32 episodes (including the epilogues, which are rarely aired in syndication) are compiled on this four-disc set, which regrettably lacks any supplemental features.--Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0007Y08P6", "B0009UC7MK", "B000B8I9ZY", "B000BYRCF6", "B000EBGE82", "B000FSME10", "B000HWZ4IY", "B003SLEDJC", "B008KZX7W0", "B005SQRYOG", "B000EGDANO", "B00FWMVVF4", "B000B7HZUK", "B00004TGYD", "B008L36520", "B000291Q3Y", "B00009VRF0", "B00HVFA36I", "B001E6JC30", "B0009OUBPQ", "B000HWZ4J8", "B0001DMXEC", "B0006Z2L4W", "B001LM64VK", "B0000AUXVS", "B001992NZG", "B0018E03CW", "B0000V4906", "B002ZTLVXY", "B0009I7NH6", "B001BN4WHW", "B00A2L1CKO", "B001AZIRY0", "1558530983", "B001DMVZJ4", "B000002T6S", "B000005KXI", "B00000HY5X", "B00650RX72", "B004NJC0RK", "B002E58FT2", "B0001IN0BC", "B00198X0YK", "B000YKYT1M", "B001NRPQKI", "B0007KIFK0", "B00HR2HTRQ", "B000NA21YA", "B0007TKNHO", "B00H8KC1N4", "B00A2L1CJK", "B001DHXT4I", "B00005JLIC", "B000068V9Y", "B001JAHPMG", "B001992NXI", "B000EXZFS0", "B000A9QKSM", "B002NZK5WS", "B0050MB5AC", "B000O59A1G", "B00016XN48", "B00016JE5U", "B000RTAUZO", "B00009QG5P", "B008VNIBTK", "B00005JOEB", "B0025X4PAQ", "B0002NY8R6", "B000FSMEB0", "B000SSQ7JW", "B008H6GH9W", "B000PHX5KU", "B008VNI9EW", "B003IB0FTE", "B000EHSVB4", "B000000ECZ", "B0000C2IVT", "B000CCBCHQ", "B000MGTQ6G", "B0038SUBDC", "B00007KK5J", "B00650RWGO", "B00274SIVK", "B0000BV1XX", "B000EU1Q3Q", "B001OXLGKA", "B005DDN51A", "B00018D404", "B008VNI9TC", "B00GOC75YW", "B0085Z6ZD8", "B003CNQPMY", "B0009B16TO", "B005D7E7Y0", "B00650RWZA", "B001E549KC", "B008L3653O", "B00FFARI7I", "B0000B1A5A"], "bought_together": ["B0007Y08P6", "B0009UC7MK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0007WFY4S", "B0007Y08P6", "B0009UC7MK", "B000NA21YA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 7076}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 14.0, "brand": "Paramount Home Video", "asin": "B0002NY8PI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61XCYJEZSAL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Andy Griffith Show - The Complete First Season"}

A funny, clubby preface on a tour bus establishes a tone of lowbrow camaraderie among Jeff Foxworthy, Larry the Cable Guy, Ron White, and Bill Engvall, but once on stage, the differences between each comic's style is considerable. Amiable Engvall kicks things off with gentle gibes: \"Men are basic: eating, sleeping, sex. I can do all those in my truck.\" The decadent air of Ron White darkens the show: \"If I'd known the difference between 'antidote' and 'anecdote,' my friend would still be alive today.\" Foxworthy, the likable Everyman, comments on his wife's hypochondria: \"Honey, you do not have testicular cancer.\" Finally, Larry the Cable Guy lowers the bar on sick-hick humor but does score occasionally: \"I got a vasectomy at Sears.

{"description": "Submitted for your approval:The Twilight Zone's inaugural season, all 36 episodes complete with Rod Serling's original promos for the following week's episode, not seen since their original broadcast. To discuss television's greatest anthology series whose title has become pop culture shorthand for the bizarre and supernatural is to immediately become like Albert Brooks and Dan Aykroyd inTwilight Zone: The Movie; a can-you-top-this recall of famous shocks and favorite twists. Several essential episodes hail from this season, among them, \"Time Enough at Last\" starring Burgess Meredith as a bespectacled bookworm who is the lone survivor of an atomic blast; \"The After-Hours\" starring Anne Francis as a department store shopper haunted by mannequins; and the profoundly disturbing \"The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street,\" in which fear and prejudice turns neighbor against neighbor (and, by the by, whose alien observers inspired Kang and Kodos onThe Simpsons).From an unsettlingly persistent hitchhiker to a malevolent slot machine,The Twilight Zone's first season did plumb \"the pit of man's fears.\" One forgets how moving the series could be. Three of this season's most memorable and enduring episodes are the poignant and primal \"stop-the-world-I-want-to-get-off fantasies, \"Walking Distance,\" \"A Stop at Willougby\" and \"The Sixteen-Millimeter Shrine,\" in which desperate characters seek refuge in a simpler past. Serling's few stabs at comedy (\"Mr. Bevis,\" \"The Mighty Casey\") have not aged well, but the series finale, \"A World of His Own,\" starring Keenan Wynn as a playwright whose fictional characters come to life, has a brilliant capper. The episodes are more deliberately paced than one might remember. Less patient younger viewers might be anxious to get to the payoffs, but once they settle into the rhythm, they will savor the literate writing and the performances by such veteran actors as Ed Wynn, Everett Sloan, and Ida Lupino, and newcomers such as Jack Klugman. The extras, including the unaired version of the pilot episode, \"Where is Everybody?\", audio commentaries and recollections, and a Serling college lecture, truly take this six-disc set to another dimension.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00BQK4YDC", "B00C6F61S2", "B000BC8T1E", "B00CPTUN8S", "B000AL733G", "B000AYEIIQ", "B00068NVLQ", "B0002CX1M0", "B0002J4ZX2", "B001DXS4DI", "B000HDR814", "B002NPY7GS", "B006TBYC76", "1879505096", "B000VDDDY6", "B0000DC3VM", "B000UAE7VS", "B0007Y08P6", "B00005JOJE", "B00092ZLDK", "B0009UC7MK", "B0007Y08RY", "B000O59A52", "B00198X0YK", "B00007ELE6", "B001DHXT3Y", "B00269PU2G", "B000LC4ZIA", "B000GETUDI", "B006TTC5A4", "B00H4KQN82", "B002TSAAS8", "B005UL4NF2", "B001E6HUWK", "B000BITV1A", "B001LM64VK", "B00JEZWRE4", "B003NOGNQU", "B0017VG69U", "B001DB6J50", "B00005N5RM", "B000062XFG", "B00133QNSG", "B000N2HD6O", "B000CCBCD0", "B001G0MFLU", "B00005LC4K", "B000Z6GT1I", "B000TXPXD2", "B000HWZ4HU", "B000SSQ7JW", "B000IHYXJO", "B00005Y1NF", "B000H5U5EE", "B008L36520", "B005LVIP1E", "B0019F030M", "B001AQO43M", "B000TJBNF8", "B0019PL2JI", "B000063V8S", "B000B7HZUK", "B001992NZG", "B0002WZTLQ", "B0000714AP", "B00D97DMQU", "B00D9EJFZA", "B000CNE0TC", "B005E7SEOI", "B00009VRF0", "B000HEZEYG", "B003CN5B7E", "B004FECNJ8", "B000MGBSH6", "B000F48D0U", "B00005JLRT", "B000TLTCT0", "B003L77G7Y", "B007KFZ85K", "B002GSXKQA", "B0040NFQ0W", "B001RIZ7OI", "B0089LT7ZG", "B000ASDFIQ", "B0007Y08LK", "B000T9OP7G", "B000BF0C8E", "B001JFKWE4", "B00A2L1CKO", "B00DZP1C9K", "0783240961", "B00871C09S", "B001GUYAZY", "B000FA57U8", "B000QQJ3Q0", "B0000VD04M", "B000BGR1B4", "B00ANGIAU8", "B000GW8UAE", "B0001WTWS8"], "bought_together": ["B00BQK4YDC", "B00C6F61S2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000H5U5EE", "B00BQK4YDC", "B00C6F61S2", "B00D9EJG2M"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 107871}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 42.09, "brand": "Image Entertainment", "asin": "B00068NVMK", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51EzHtftO7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Twilight Zone - Season 1 (The Definitive Edition)"}

{"description": "The Lone Gunmenwas the short-lived spin-off series starring those scene-stealing conspiracy theorists fromThe X-Files.  To recap, there is buttoned-down Byers (the bearded, relatively normal-looking one, played by Bruce Harwood), the \"man of action\" Frohike (the short one who had the hots for Scully, played by Tom Braidwood), and master hacker Langly (the one with the long blond hair, played by Dean Haglund). They also meet some new characters who both help and hinder: a female agent calling herself Yves Adele Harlow (and other anagrams for Lee Harvey Oswald, played by Zuleikha Robinson), who always seems a step ahead of them, and James \"Jimmy\" Bond (Stephen Snedden), the dimwitted benefactor who thinks that the Gunmen give him a purpose in life.The series lasted a mere 13 episodes, and in retrospect probably plays better now than it did in the spring of 2001 when the peak years ofThe X-Fileswere still fresh in the memory. Thanks to direction and writing by the same creative talent and music by Mark Snow,The Lone Gunmenhas the feel of Chris Carter's signature series, though without the impenetrable mythology and the sexual tension (Robinson is beautiful, but let's be serious).  The episodes are generally stand-alone affairs reflecting the goofy humor that made the trio part of the comic relief inThe X-Files.  Light-hearted topics include a blind football team and a super-intelligent chimpanzee, but the closing episode dealt with the familiar themes of alien abduction and government cover-ups (a thread that after the series' cancellation had to be concluded in an episode ofThe X-Files, which is also included in this set).  And particularly chilling is the pilot: aired six months before 9/11, it deals with an attempt to fly an airplane into the World Trade Center.The Lone Gunmencouldn't match the brilliant inspiration ofThe X-Files(few shows could), but for fans it might just be the next best thing.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001CY5N00", "B000EXDS3Y", "B000EXDS3E", "B001G7PSZI", "B000EXDS34", "B000CNE0TC", "B000CNE0T2", "B000CNE0SS", "B00028HOMM", "B000BOH990", "B001FACH7S", "B0007X7044", "B003V1IU3O", "B000BOH98G", "B00CRVL5ZE", "B000BOH986", "B00LPY2I1E", "B000UZDO5I", "B0009X76XW", "B000667HBS", "B0002JP4DW", "1613779445", "1613777515", "B00FXUXZCM", "B000FJH5M2", "B00465I156", "0061686174", "B000244E2O", "B001G7PSSK", "B000EOTV98", "B00LMBURV8", "B000FOPPBA", "B0007ZEO7I", "1631401653", "B001NT2KPK", "B0037AGB9O", "B0009NZ2RE", "B001G7PT4I", "B004XM38CS", "B00F3L8P26", "B0051GOB2G", "B000FIHN8O", "B000F7CMPE", "B00KXEMDRG", "B00JK47BHM", "B0056GLNQI", "B00L9K2EGS", "B005GYXN2M", "1613778961", "1933784725", "B002ZHKZGA", "B00GTZWZH6", "B000ATQYWY", "B0009JE6G6", "1613777183", "B000AQ68X2", "B008B4KVRE", "B00E5G03I4", "B0010YVCAM", "B003BNO9GO", "1613776632", "B009AHSKWE", "B001KOFH2G", "B003PGNBO8", "B002FLOTPO", "0061053309", "B0012IX35S", "B0009X7646", "B001CQONMC", "B002USF1UO", "B001A7GOCA", "B00092A1J4", "B001QE99BA", "B00IURL19Y", "B001CQONOA", "B004U7MQYC", "B000F3UAE8", "B00FA7WAXS", "B0002PYSB0", "0684856182", "B00466H3A4", "B00IT3KQMC", "B001715A92", "B0002J4ZX2", "B00005JM39", "B00K7IPGS6", "B004U7MQY2", "B0007CEXUY", "B0081QF6Q8", "B000ELL1QC", "B00404ME2E", "B000BCCAEQ", "B00GT4NCBU", "B001HUHBBS", "1613778597", "B000BK7QFQ", "B000056BP1", "B00INCF2X2", "B00AGKHC3C", "B00BM2JVAA"], "bought_together": ["B001CY5N00", "B000EXDS3Y"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001G7PSZI", "B003V1IU3O", "B001CY5N00", "B000EXDS3E"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 19220}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 27.74, "brand": "20TH Century Fox", "asin": "B0006UEVUE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/511WFF325TL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Lone Gunmen: The Complete Series"}

{"description": "Primerwon the Grand Jury Prize at the 2004 Sundance Film Festival and has drawn repeat viewers eager to crack writer-director-star Shane Carruth's puzzler of a time-travel drama. Carruth, an engineer by training, plays inventor Aaron, whose entrepreneurial partnership with fellow brainiac Abe (David Sullivan) unexpectedly results in a process for traveling back several hours in time. The men initially use these rewind sessions to succeed in the stock market. But a dark consequence of their daily journeys eventually complicates matters. If this sounds like a very commercial, science fiction thriller,Primeris anything but that. Shot on 16mm for $7,000, the film has a tantalizing, sealed-in logic, akin toMemento, that forces viewers to see the fantastic with a certain dispassion.

The once-tranquil school is transformed into a place of morbid terror, as if the words written in the journal, \"memento mori\" (remember the dead), have come to life.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000FZEQEQ", "B000FZEQVY", "B002OMIKSG", "B0009NCQL4", "B0016MJ6KQ", "B000FS9FIA", "B000GSYRY6", "B000FVQYW2", "B000GB5MOW", "B000NO243E", "B000CSTKHE", "B000MM0LHS", "B003UTPL2A", "B0000CC885", "B000Q7ZKWU", "B00070Q8LI", "B000H5U5YO", "B000NA28GG", "B001570H5K", "B002U041OE", "B000AAF25S", "B0007M23D8", "B000MM0LH8", "B002P7UCJK", "B000MEYKCI", "B0009KA2UO", "B000GBEWNY", "B00FJX96BC", "B000PKG8TW", "B000NA21RM", "B001KEGR66", "B0009A40PC", "B006L4MWVE", "B000EDWKYW", "B00260LDSU", "B0009WFEDC", "B005G7WGRW", "B000CRR3ME", "B0009YA3YA", "B0002Y4T4M", "B000E0OE4O", "B00BOYLIAC", "B000F0UUMI", "B0007CNY2W", "B00005JNJR", "B001L28H1K", "B004P2VQZ2", "B004O63TWW", "B000BVM240", "B0001IXSZ0", "B00FM29HHI", "B000H0M4CK", "B0002ZDW7Q", "B000BGH2A4", "B0007UVXCC", "B000FILUTM", "B006C1S1DY", "B004QI14UC", "B000LPS3AS", "B0007XBM8O", "B00000F7E6", "B0000YAEHK", "B00BUBE2N4", "B000AQKZ3Q", "B00CBDG4I6", "B00104AYG0", "B000LPS3B2", "B0009S2T0M", "B000C8STDK", "B00E5MIM04", "B000EDWKZ6", "B000TGUUEQ", "B0097C046W", "B003YGC7QC", "B0009KQOZQ", "B000E3LGMY", "B000GSE6H4", "B0000633R6", "B000088NQR", "B00BDUIFVW", "B0019X3ZOK", "B0016K76VY", "B001P9N9AI", "B004ZKNBXE", "B00151QYF8", "B00066FBQ6", "B0013D8LD6", "B000R7HY32", "B006G6GTNY", "B006UTDFQQ", "B0002IQLT4", "B000ARXG68", "B00136MBUW", "B00008HCA7", "B000AM4PGI", "B001O7SWJ4", "B0000633TH", "B000IMVE5K", "B00125WAW8", "B000FZEQEG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000GSYRY6", "B002P7UCJK", "B003UTPL2A", "B000NA28GG"]}, "price": 8.81, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 312101}, "asin": "B0007R4TLC", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51NQTGVEAJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Memento Mori"}

{"description": "The film is set in France near the end of World War I in the deadly trenches of the Somme, in the gilded Parisien halls of power, and in the modest home of an indomitable provincial girl. It tells the story of this young woman's relentless, moving and sometimes comic search for her fiancC)e, who has disappeared. He is one of five French soldiers believed to have been court-martialed under mysterious circumstances and pushed out of an allied trench into an almost-certain death in no-man's land. What follows is an investigation into the arbitrary nature of secrecy, the absurdity of war, and the enduring passion, intuition and tenacity of the human heart.DVD Features:Audio CommentaryDeleted Scenes:With Director audio commentaryDocumentaries:Paris in the 20'sThe Zepplin ExplosionFeaturette:The Making of A Very Long EngagementTheatrical Trailer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001CIOCLC", "B0045NXMJE", "B004YCKKH8", "B000934FC2", "B00000K3TS", "B004SEUIXS", "B008H1Q3QY", "B00005JM48", "B002LE8MGW", "B00005JPX8", "B0000C9JFO", "B002VKB0M4", "B00EMAGJ68", "B000UVV26A", "B001THZAAI", "B0069UV0AY", "B000YPUFBA", "B002AG2NTI", "B0045NXMMQ", "B0087IT8FK", "B001AZJKKK", "B004ZG5EYC", "B000B58DHQ", "B00421IR5I", "B005V4X8PO", "B000063K0U", "B00BTYJYR6", "B007I1Q59E", "B000I6BJ56", "B00000F7E6", "B00A92MEJY", "B0042FDCR2", "B000HIVIQU", "B009CSVQ8Q", "B000811672", "0312424582", "B0019UGYAU", "B0009P7EI2", "B00275EHVE", "B005E7SEK2", "B00EV1YZKK", "B004B3254Q", "B002BWP3UC", "B003VA3JTA", "B001M72J68", "B0002S64SM", "B000GBEWP2", "B0080QOL6A", "B000BB18WC", "B000OVLBGC", "B009B8YMB0", "B0036TGSJE", "B000LW7L2M", "B00DPJEWDO", "0792841409", "B00GS08Y3Q", "B000B9EYFW", "B0002ZMJD4", "B00068S3QY", "B00K0MM4AM", "B004YCKKIM", "B000SSQ7JC", "B0051HCVEU", "B005MYEQ4U", "B00005B1WH", "B00003CWTI", "B001JV5BA8", "B0031REQKE", "B00007J5VT", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B003J7HO6E", "B00GPPXNIK", "B002WY65VA", "B004XVMCG2", "B000YDMPAQ", "B00EV1YZQE", "B004SIP6BI", "B000HWZ4I4", "B00AZNEVNE", "B0001I54QQ", "B001CITQWC", "B00AZNEVJ8", "B00GX7WUD4", "B000KGGJ0Y", "B000H5V8H2", "B00ARX2VZW", "B00INUK5WM", "B00009OOFG", "B00F6SHGF8", "B00ENMZK1A", "B0011FDVGI", "B009TT0BSE", "B000CBG5PG", "B0014FAIZC", "B0046YK4KW", "B000N3T0DW", "B004EI2NUO", "B00003CXXY", "B004UXUUDA", "B002U1LGSW"], "bought_together": ["B001CIOCLC", "B004SEUIXS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001CIOCLC", "B004SEUIXS", "B0000C9JFO", "B00005JPX8"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 18840}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.74, "brand": "Warner Brothers", "asin": "B0007Z0NYQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51uMf%2BoLZPL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "A Very Long Engagement"}

{"description": "Gate of Flesh(Nikutai no mon) is another wonderful example of why Seijun Suzuki will go down in history as one of Japan's craftiest and most ingenious B-movie directors. As exhibited inBranded to KillandTokyo DrifterSuzuki has the uncanny ability to take shoestring budgets, predictable boilerplate scripts, tight schedules, and studio-contracted actors and spin these elements to create extremely deep and layered films.Gate of Fleshis no exception.  In post-World War II Japan, life on the Tokyo streets has become desperate. Amidst the ruins, a tough, well-worn group of prostitutes bands together for survival and companionship. When an ex-soldier enters into the circle, flames of jealousy, anger, and lust are fueled, ending with disastrous results.  On the surface, the story is a simple pulp tale of decadence thrown together by Nikkatsu Studios to make a quick buck.

{"description": "Writer/director Todd Solondz has no patience for formulas or safe choices.  Most filmmakers, after making a movie as commercially unsuccessful and critically slammed as the underratedStorytelling, would strive to broaden their appeal. Solondz, instead, madePalindromes, a movie about a troubled young girl named Aviva whose only goal in life is to have children--a goal that leads her through abortion, religious extremism, pedophilia, and more. But for many viewers, the plot isn't as off-putting as the casting: Over the course of the movie, Aviva is played by eight very different actresses (including Jennifer Jason Leigh,Rush).  Like Solondz's other movies (includingWelcome to the DollhouseandHappiness),Palindromesinitially seems emotionally brutal and absurd, but gradually grows engaging and even moving, albeit in strange and unexpected ways.Palindromesis given an extra boost by a hypnotic, emotionally unleashed performance by Ellen Barkin (The Big Easy,Drop Dead Gorgeous) as Aviva's mother.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00000IC7G", "B00005JKJG", "0767827740", "B004WPYO4M", "B008ZQ4W64", "B004WPYO38", "B00JVQ7QTM", "B0012E2GFK", "B00005U14H", "B001DJ7PQY", "B0019X4008", "B00005T30L", "078062856X", "B000F6II1M", "B00013RC2K", "B00EOBB7LC", "B001AZKB8K", "B008ZQ4W5U", "B00GGY4R3K", "B00009MEC4", "B000B8I9XQ", "B0048LPRD2", "0767846869", "B002BWP4A6", "B000ELL1RG", "B0045HCJ94", "B0068CEGB8", "B00BNWWVFG", "B000059HA5", "B0013D8L7M", "B000EGEKRO", "B001FOK70S", "B0002DB52M", "B001P3SA8K", "B000S0GYRU", "B003KGBISE", "B0002KPHTW", "B000056HED", "B009VO9XSG", "B000BMY2NS", "B0007N1JC8", "B00G0PXU2Y", "B00023P4N8", "B00000F7E6", "B008220DGE", "B006OB3K56", "B001R3YRG2", "B0002CHK1S", "B00003CWQR", "B00AEBBA68"], "bought_together": ["B00000IC7G"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0767827740", "B00000IC7G", "B004WPYO4M", "B00005JKJG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 205872}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 19.73, "brand": "GAIAM INTERNATIONAL", "asin": "B000A1IOGG", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/6144FE2SCAL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Palindromes"}

{"description": "Horror buffs will surely be compelled to compare and contrastDominionwithExorcist: The Beginning, two films weirdly linked by film history. Director Paul Schrader shotDominiononly to find studio bosses underwhelmed by its horror aspects, at which point Renny Harlin was hired to direct another take on the subject with the same lead actor, setting, and similar storyline. That became the 2004 theatrical releaseExorcist: The Beginning.As expected, the Schrader version has more tortured religiosity and visual poetry than Harlin's cheesier (but admittedly gripping) re-do. Father Merrin (Stellan Skarsgard) carries his guilt from the Nazi occupation to a remote African archaeological dig, where a mysteriously buried church has been uncovered. Strange stuff happens nearby, and a fervent young priest (good performance by Gabriel Mann) parries spiritual points with the now-doubting Merrin. Some of the ideas are strong and the sun-and-sand cinematography by the great Vittorio Storaro is often stunning. As beautiful as the film is to look at, it must be admitted that the climax is disappointingly flat, the leading lady (Clara Bellar) is a washout, and one begins to yearn for the occasional genre shock of the kind Schrader was able to conjure up in his remake ofCat People. If you're anExorcistfan, watch it for its serious treatment of Merrin's crisis, which ties in to his character in the 1973 original.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00065HKLG", "B000067FP5", "B0000399W9", "B003UGLCIA", "B000HEWEGC", "B00KDU8HQQ", "B00HRUQ8X4", "B003L20IEW", "B00HRCBGRA", "B00HNTOVWE", "B00FYV7WCY", "B00DYRNGQ6", "B000BTJDGC", "B0029EW7BA", "B00IKM5LFY", "B004EPYZO4", "B00HHYF570", "B00EF0NY7W", "B001KKU9CI", "B00GJ7CUFG", "B001992NW4", "B003VE9WP6", "B00096S48U", "B00GHH9IIA", "B000AM4P9K", "B000099T3M", "B00EZ50SGW", "B00018D42W", "B000S0GYRU", "B000056T5E", "B00GDDNFDW", "B00D7AM5U8", "B00D7AM698", "B002LMSWN2", "B0085Z3AMW", "B0011NVC98", "B00452J5KU", "B000PMLJMQ", "B00DEQQK8S", "B00003CXCF", "B00D7AM5XU", "B0089N4G50", "B0000CDRVX", "B00009PY4G", "0783116926", "B00111YM5Q", "B00000IQVC", "B00CPTUNVA", "B00H9LHX8K", "6305718954", "B003SG8122", "B00004TS0G", "B000HCO86I", "B001TK80C0", "B001QB9H1U", "B00DI012O2", "B000Q66Q8I", "B009B8YNGO", "B00BWJQEFI", "B0000694XX", "B0002IQLH6", "B00AIBZM40", "B004B3PBFQ", "B00001TZ6Q", "B00AEFYYH6", "B0021L8UFI", "B00A50PDS4", "B000FA57UI", "B00BEJL6Q8", "B001P3SA9Y", "B0000AOX0A", "B000EHQTZO", "6301971345", "B00000K3TO", "B0000AOX09", "B00195FUDC", "0767817737", "B000QGEB1W", "B00A429Y9M", "B000QQJ3Q0", "B000EOTV98", "B000CNE0M4", "B00F98FOI6", "B00005JNTU", "B001OQCVI8", "0767847431", "B00000F3SB", "B00EZ50R04", "B001NPD9LS", "B001DJLD1W", "B00AWWX6XY", "B001KVZ6ES", "B002VWNIDG", "B00GDDNMEY", "B00HF98SY4", "B001CFLGYQ", "B000GCFO0I", "B001BNFRB2", "B0067QPVD2", "B00BEIYMAG"], "bought_together": ["B00065HKLG", "B000067FP5"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00065HKLG", "B0000399W9", "B000HEWEGC", "B003UGLCIA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 38870}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.51, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B000AYEL4W", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HpsR6nFNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Dominion - Prequel to the Exorcist"}

Lindsay as Goober Pyle, cousin to Jim Nabors's Gomer, makes his debut in one of the season's funniest episodes, \"Fun Girls,\" which is also the only time Gomer and Goober appeared together on screen. By season's end, Gomer would depart for his own series (season 4's final episode, \"Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.,\" would serve as the pilot for that program), but before then, he enjoyed some fine episodes, including \"Andy Saves Gomer\" (from a fire at the filing station) and \"Citizen's Arrest\" (a knockout showcase for Nabors and Don Knotts, who is topnotch, as always, as Barney Fife).

Bass Joins the Army\") and Denver Pyle and Maggie Peterson's Briscoe and Charlene Darling (\"Briscoe Declares for Aunt Bee\"), but of course, the crux of the show remains Andy and son Opie (Ron Howard), who do stand-out work in the well-loved \"Opie the Birdman,\" which addresses serious topics--death and responsibility--in the series' typically warm and humane manner. No supplemental features accompany the 32 black-and-white episodes, but that won't detract one bit from spending some quality time with the good people of Mayberry.--Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0009UC7MK", "B000BYRCF6", "B0007Y08P6", "B000EBGE82", "B0002NY8PI", "B000FSME10", "B000HWZ4IY", "B003SLEDJC", "B0018E03CW", "B000VDDE1I", "B001992NZG", "B001DHXT4I", "B008L36520", "B008KZX7W0", "B000EGDANO", "B0041SI7B6", "B00004TGYD", "B008L3650M", "B008VNI9TC", "B000B7HZUK", "B00198X0YK", "B000BITV1A", "B00H8KC1N4", "B00007IG1K", "B00016XN48", "B008L3653O", "B000005KXI", "B001JAHQQ6", "B00KW02JW0", "B001E6JC26", "B000M343AI", "B0038SUBDC", "B000CCBCK8", "B001E6JC1W", "B0001AVZDU", "B000A7PKGW", "B0009OUBPQ", "B0007R4SWC", "B00650RX90", "B000N6UF10", "B00096S480", "B00007KK5J", "B00650RX72", "B0001IN0BC", "B0000B1A5A", "B0013LRKV2", "B008H6GH9W", "B000O59A1G", "B0007KIFK0", "B000BNTM46", "B000HWZ4E8", "B008M4C1DU", "B0009I7NH6", "B00KB01N4G", "B000G6BL7O", "B000BC8T1E", "B004D2GMVM", "B001NRPQKI", "B000000ECZ", "B0006TPE1U", "B000GRUMQY", "B000291Q3Y", "B000CCBCHQ", "B0002W4SWW", "B0006Z2L4W", "B00650RWGO", "B000002T6S", "B000IHYXIK", "B008VNI9EW", "B000EU1Q3Q", "B003XEKXYI", "B000FSME1K", "B000EQ5PTQ", "B000E3L7FK", "B00274SIVK", "B000CNESLW", "B00009QG5P", "B000HWZ4J8", "B0025X4PBA", "B000BT96FA", "B000AJJNIQ", "B000RO9PTQ", "B000BOH8YQ", "B00A2L1CJK", "B000291Q3O", "B002OOWKVM", "B004MLEYUK", "B0001DMXEC", "B004GSVXAI", "B000B5XOUM", "B001E549KC", "B0001NBNJ8", "B003CNQPMY", "B000UX6TKM", "B008VNIBTK", "B0050MB5AC", "B0007TKNHO", "B000A5046K", "B000EXZFS0", "B003IRUFB6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0007Y08P6", "B0009UC7MK", "B0002NY8PI", "B000BYRCF6"]}, "price": 1.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 205344}, "asin": "B000B6TTBE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61H4VPNMCPL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Andy Griffith Show - The Complete Fourth Season"}

{"description": "Before he made the notorious cult hitOldboy, South Korean director Chan-wook Park createdSympathy for Mr. Vengeance, an equally gruesome yet elegant meditation on revenge. Desperate to get a kidney transplant for his dying sister, a deaf and dumb young man named Ryu (Ha-kyun Shin,Save the Green Planet!) kidnaps the daughter of a wealthy industrialist named Park (Kang-ho Song,Shiri). Despite Ryu's best intentions, things go horribly awry, setting in motion a series of escalating revenges--to describe the plot in more detail would undercut the movie, because much of its power comes from the spare and skillful storytelling. Chan-wook Park is careful to ground the audience in the characters' emotional lives; when the violence begins, the bloody events unfold with the hypnotic power of the revenge tragedies of the Shakespearean era, which had over-the-top plots and littered the stage with bodies, yet were full of rich poetry. Park's eye for startling images and careful editing creates a visual poetry, grotesque yet often haunting. Certainly not a film for everyone--squeamish viewers had best beware, while anyone who wants their violence flagrant and guilt-free will be disappointed--but cinephiles looking to have their hearts squeezed along with their stomachs will enjoySympathy for Mr. Vengeance.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000GBEWNY", "B0009S2T0M", "B002P7UCJK", "B003Y7F1IW", "B004P2VQZ2", "B000GSYRY6", "B0009XRZQK", "B003JDQJM8", "B000CRR3ME", "B0009WFEDC", "B0000CABGW", "B004H2CXBQ", "B000GSE6H4", "B00C6WHPO4", "B006L4MWVE", "B00CG0YLS4", "B0000CC885", "B0009NZ78I", "B003NLE5JA", "B000V6I7WG", "B00J5LXST0", "B000PKG8TW", "B00G3HCG9M", "B008OTTVC2", "B001570H5K", "B004XQO8MS", "B00BTFK014", "B005B0ZF3Q", "B0006VL1J2", "B000AAF25S", "B001I82RVS", "B00C6WHSRI", "B000NO243E", "B000NA28GG", "B000MM0LH8", "B000GB5MOW", "B004SEUJEG", "B00GXFZOYI", "B00006FDBW", "B00HRYH52I", "B004ZKKKW4", "B0013D8LBI", "B006C1S1DY", "B001VG2MAI", "B00104AYG0", "B004H2IMSO", "B000FS9FIA", "B00HI9QGWC", "B00005K9O8", "B00GXG5KLY", "B004326EV0", "B00HSJ2EMI", "B00125WATQ", "B00GMV8IGO", "B00BSN0VZW", "B005HG8VE4", "B004XQO8LY", "B000GI3RHY", "B000BVM240", "B00CAT3T8Y", "B005X7HA6C", "B00J5LXTUI", "B00JJ3EHCG", "B004P2VQXE", "B000PKG8SS", "B002BWP3UC", "B0043VUHV4", "B000C65YMQ", "B00E1LNDDU", "B000I8OMEY", "B00HI9QDXO", "B00004TJM8", "B000FVQYW2", "B00ENTX7JU", "B001MEJY8W", "B0085A9J18", "B002C8YSCE", "B002OMIKSG", "B0002W4TOO", "B00H4IR3JC", "B00JVQ7RCS", "B0001IXSZ0", "B000HAX8ZC", "B0018JKLT2", "0783228457", "B0009WIE2A", "B0028DRGDQ", "B006L4MWTQ", "6305972532", "B000F0UUMI", "B00CG0YM24", "B000E6EK5G", "B001FOPOD8", "B006L4MX4A", "B000FZEQF0", "B002E2QH8G", "B000MMLP9G", "B000BRBA8S", "B00CEIOH50", "B00GHH9HP4"], "bought_together": ["B000GBEWNY", "B0009S2T0M"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0009S2T0M", "B002JYPVT0", "B000GBEWNY", "B006L4MWVE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 49460}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.79, "brand": "", "asin": "B000BGH2A4", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5181VNVC5AL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance"}

{"description": "HasYoung Mr. Lincoln--the first cardinal masterpiece of director John Ford's career, and the finest film of that epochal Hollywood year 1939--been neglected because people fear it's a stodgy history lesson? Even Henry Fonda, drafted to play the title role, was reluctant till Ford testily explained, \"This isn't 'The Great Emancipator,' for God's sake--it's a movie about this jackleg lawyer....\" And so it is: a small, slow-gathering village tale about a young man whose biggest moments--such as losing the love of his life--occur between scenes, and whose emergence as a historic figure is decades away. Yet the essential Lincoln is being forged in luminous scenes that unfold with the simplicity of fable, only no one knows it's a fable yet. The French title for the movie says it beautifully:Toward His Destiny.The script, by Lamar Trotti, introduces Lincoln as a frontier storekeeper and drolly inadequate politician. In an early scene, we see Abe receiving his first books of law in a casual transaction with a pioneer family on their way to make a new home in the wilderness. But was it Trotti or the director who decided that this same family should circle back into Abe's life years later for the dramatic heart of the film, a murder trial in which his wit, ingenuity, and bedrock decency shape Lincoln's first public triumph--and that neither Lincoln nor the family recognize they have met before?That's typical of the movie, in which what is most important, most definitive, most valuable, is always outside the frame, out of reach, beyond naming. Even triumph is imbued with a heartbreaking sense of loss.This transcendently beautiful film was a modest production, without the Pulitzer Prize cachet ofAbe Lincoln in Illinois(not a Ford picture) the following year. Fonda, in his first of six collaborations with Ford, is the only marquee name in the cast, though Alice Brady is radiant as the pioneer matriarch (her final performance), and Ford stalwart Ward Bond has a key role. Sergei Eisenstein, no less, wrote a lucid and impassioned appreciation of the film, hailing it as \"a movie I would like to have made\"--and proved it by stealing a few visual tropes for his ownIvan the Terrible!

{"description": "InLois & Clark's first season, Clark Kent (Dean Cain) and Lois Lane (Teri Hatcher) joined the ranks of Sam and Diane and David and Maddie as TV's sparkiest couples whose devoted fans couldn't wait to see get together. Season 2 takes the star-crossed duo--and the series--to \"the next step\"; a long-awaited first kiss (the episode \"Lucky Leon\"), and declarations of love, culminating in a season-ending marriage proposal (\"And the Answer Is...\"). But getting to that deliriously romantic rain-soaked moment is all the fun. There are diabolical villains for Superman to foil, including a resurrected (and bald) Lex Luthor (John Shea  reprising his first-season role in \"The Phoenix\"), a trash-TV host (Raquel Welch in \"Top Copy), the vengeful Prankster (Bronson Pinchot in \"The Prankster\" and \"Return of the Prankster\"), and, incredibly, a time-traveled Al Capone (William Devane in \"That Old Gang of Mine\"). There is also a romantic rival for Clark's affections, Deputy D.A. Mayson Drake (Farrah Forke in \"Church of Metropolis\") and for Lois's (Jim Pirri as agent Daniel Scardino in \"Resurrection\").Lois and Clark's second season not only features improved special effects, but a stellar roster of character actors: Roger Corman veteran Dick Miller as Lois's uncle and Peter Boyle as Intergang kingpin Bill Church in \"Church of Metropolis\"; a reunited Sherman Hemsley and Isabel Sanford (The Jeffersons) in the Dean Cain-penned holiday episode, \"Season's Greedings\"; Bruce Campbell as Bill Church Jr. in \"Individual Responsibility\"; and Terry Kiser ofWeekend at Bernie'sfame as H.G. Wells in \"Tempus Fugitive,\" the fan-favorite episode in which futuristic villain Tempus spills the beans to the \"galactically stupid\" Lois about Clark's secret identity. \"That was worth the whole trip,\" he cackles, and for series fans, this benchmark (albeit fleeting) moment is probably worth the price of this super six-disc set.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00BBXSPES", "B00BBXSPCK", "B00080ZG2O", "B00AKK6MD4", "B000EU1Q2M", "B004EXWGJW", "B00LT1JKN2", "B00LT1JHLW", "B00DX88IL4", "B00G7QPX6C", "B000HWZ4E8", "B000I8OM94", "B000A5046K", "B000EU1Q3Q", "B001FB4VZS", "B000BT96FA", "B002JVWRDQ", "B0001JXPPC", "B003L77GG0", "B0002Y0QV2", "B0009A5MUO", "B000X5SMXY", "B000G1R4SO", "B00005JLKB", "B000N6SE4U", "B00J49R0ZQ", "B000R206FK", "B001NY4X3W", "B00KTZALDC", "B000J10EQU", "B00BHLTIXQ", "B00AMDA2P8", "B0016QNSGA", "B0001ZMWYG", "B000SMNL92", "B000CQM4YM", "B0000C237S", "B0002NY81C", "B00KS9V6EC", "B000A2X3T8", "B005G5NPD8", "B0012U7IWU", "B000P6XQ50", "B00005JOJR", "B000BUE5D2", "B002K0WBDM", "B002LWJ510", "B0007UDCX0", "B0017VG690", "B001FB4W02", "B00HFWETQW", "B009V9N1NE", "B000OPODNQ", "B0039ZBM3W", "B004XWLN20", "B000E5KQM8", "B00BCMT49I", "B000AJJNIQ", "B000093W4T", "B000GG4Y5K", "B006LG74RE", "B00005JM3A", "B000CSTK42", "B00466H3CC", "B000FO0AHY", "B002JVWRE0", "B00ET6LPRI", "B001AZIRZO", "B000Y7U9AK", "B0025KVNOU", "B003L77FWA", "B009L0NC82", "B000ION23U", "B000IJ79UW", "B002C8YSBU", "B0039ZBM1O", "B0002W4SWW", "B00GM473M6", "B00J9BZ4KC", "B00K7IPGS6", "B00IYRLUAU", "B00JDCP0QA", "B00008KA59", "B001OD8E4G", "B00008KGT0", "B0007US7CQ", "B003L77FWU", "B000EYK4H6", "B0006Z2KZ2", "B00344EAG4", "B00C10EG7A", "B00B58FVBY", "B000O77SN6", "B000WC39P4", "B001DJLD2G", "B001F3FUK6", "B0007US79Y", "B000HWZ4IE", "B00308B170", "B004UQPM4E"], "bought_together": ["B00BBXSPES", "B00BBXSPCK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00080ZG2O", "B00BBXSPCK", "B00BBXSPES", "B000HWZ4BG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 42761}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 19.79, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B000BT96EG", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51-wN-uU1aL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman: Season 2"}

{"description": "Any fan of Steve Martin's2000 novellawill enjoy this pitch-perfect adaptation, which glowingly captures the bittersweet tones of a May-December romance. Martin wrote the screenplay and stars as Ray Porter, a button-down 50-something executive who reaches out to a much younger woman as a Los Angeles playmate. The book and movie, though, are both primarily about Mirabelle (Claire Danes), a 20-something with a pile of promises, debt, and depression, as she fades away into a slow corner of Saks selling unneeded formal gloves. She's a wisp of a person, with a cat who doesn&#x92;t love her, and when she finds a suitor, it's Jeremy (Jason Schwartzman), a scruffy artist who babbles on about speakers. When the gentlemanly Porter calls, his appearance in her life begins to make her whole. It also immediately sets her up for sadness--Ray thinks of Mirabella as a precious outlet for sex, while Mirabelle, very mistakenly, sees Ray as a potential lifelong mate. Martin deftly turns the novella's prose into dialogue, allowing the movie to feel full-bodied, and the film also works as a comedy, as we witness Jeremy's growth on the road with a rock band. Schwartzman would walk away with film if not for the perfectly cast leads: Martin does another smart turn away from his wild-and-crazy moniker, Danes has never been better in an Oscar-worthy performance, and Bridgette Wilson-Sampras aces her role as a hot-to-trot co-worker of Mirabelle's. Whoever's decision to have Martin be the omnipresent narrator, though, should be penalized, as it&#x92;s confusing to have him in two roles, and the information is pretty useless, even robbing the film of a final grace note.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000F5FNPC", "B000F6IODE", "B000BYY11Y", "B00079HZUM", "B00008979G", "B000V6LSOA", "B003BZ58RQ", "B005Z9MH7U", "B0012BR8DI", "B0000797IO", "B000VY1EYG", "0786891076", "B000062WWZ", "B00081U7HC", "B00005JMJ4", "B004499LX0", "B00B9ZD73M", "B0016MJ6HY", "B0064MT1FI", "B000EQHXNW", "0767818105", "B00005JMWP", "B000BX8R10", "B0038N9WKU", "B000056BSJ", "1419897543", "B00ADRYCWC", "B004L3AR0K", "B002ONC9NC", "0783227353", "B000NIVJFY", "B00IKM5OCO", "B005Z9MGRG", "6305428239", "B0002KPIQY", "B000CNESJO", "B000035Z3C", "B000EDWKXI", "B0010X8NF0", "078322740X", "B000053VB5", "B00AEFY8MM", "B00007JXWX", "B00FZ4KR4U", "B000BBOUUE", "B001UV4XGU", "0786866586", "B000IU37SO", "0783229402", "B0071HPP3M", "B00IXD2LJY", "B000ADWDFC", "B000GFRI54", "B0000640VJ", "6305308802", "B000067J1O", "B004XVMCKS", "B002T51X4Q", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B0001Z4P2I", "B004XVMCK8", "B000B8QG22", "B003Z8ZC2A", "B001KP2J2G", "B004D45NYC", "B00005JMBQ", "B00AEBB8P6", "B00005JL7Q", "B00007AJE1", "B00BMKGZVA", "B00BEIYGK2", "B000CS45TW", "B00005JMJD", "B00005KHJJ", "B00319ECBK", "B0068MNO2U", "B004LWZWBU", "B0013D8LCC", "B004GJYRA0", "B000LXHK2C", "B002O3Z4ZW", "B001P3SA8K", "B003Y5H574", "B000T988I8", "B002ZFEQ76", "B001URA5Y8", "B002ZG99UE", "B00G3DA5XA", "0767815122", "B001UV4XUG", "B00AEBB9G4", "B00FWSWIUU", "B0001O3YV2", "B00AADAEBW", "B00008972P", "B001MM3AZM", "B00AEFXJ86", "B00A18CG76", "B004H83IG4", "B00803PFWM"], "bought_together": ["B000F6IODE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0786866586", "B00079HZUM", "B007HW18CS", "B002WY65VA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 30533}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.45, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B000EDWKX8", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51vVNaGhmPL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Shopgirl"}
{"description": "The second season ofLeave It to Beaverfinds the Cleaver family happy and wholesome as ever, with most episodes involving the Beaver getting into a scrape, or hearing the from-the-mountaintop advice from Mom or Dad afterwards. Despite the formula, the episodes hold up well, because of the earnestness of the actors and the delivery of their lines, which is, well, swell. Mom June (Barbara Billingsley) is the matriarch who makes it all look easy in her well-pressed frocks and pearls (pay close attention to those necklaces--there are actually several; some plain strands and some with pendants), and Dad Ward (Hugh Beaumont) is thoughtful and a little monolithic. But it's the adventures of boys, older brother Wally (Tony Dow) and the Beav (Jerry Mathers), that make the show so fun. One episode involves Beav and pal Larry (Rusty Stevens) playing hooky (they're late to school anyway, and they figure they may as well get \"killed\" later as opposed to today), and then winding up on live TV, on a show which June just happens to be watching. Moral? Golly gee, there's more than one, and they're delivered by both parentsandBeav's teacher--and echoed earnestly by Beaver himself. The  chuckles come in a ready stream, even if sometimes inadvertently. Sample exchange: Wally: \"Mom, can I get tattooed?\" June: \"Tattooed!? Absolutely not!\" Wally: \"Oh, OK. Bye.\" No wonder people are so nostalgic for the '50s--teenagers never gave anyone any lip. This season, 1957-58, contains 39 remastered episodes on three double-sided discs, and is a treasure box of nostalgia, in the absolute best sense.--A.T.

{"description": "The classic combination of James Spader and William Shatner is just one of many reasons to savor the inaugural 17-episode season ofBoston Legal. Making its highly rated ABC debut on October 3, 2004, this darkly comedic spinoff fromThe Practicelooked like a formulaic reworking of creator David E. Kelley's previously successful seriesAlly McBeal, with similar plots and quirky characters enmeshed in personal and professional affairs of the heart at the prestigious Boston law firm of Crane, Poole & Schmidt. It quickly became apparent that Kelley, co-executive producer Bill D'Elia, and the show's magnificent ensemble cast were onto something equally fresh, funny, and infectiously entertaining.Red Carpet Video: TheBoston Legalcast gives Amazon.com some behind-the-scenes scoopand recommends their favorite DVDs and music.High|LowBoth Shatner and Spader won Emmys for their original roles onThe Practice, and the priceless pairing of the erratic, egomaniacal senior partner Denny Crane (Shatner, doing the best work of his career) and ethically challenged attorney Alan Shore (Spader, likewise) signaled the arrival of one of the finest comedic duos in TV history. Waging a two-man war on political correctness, the boisterous has-been Denny loves the sound of his own name (the mere mention of \"Denny Crane\" qualifies as ego-stroking foreplay), unabashedly subjects female associates to his lascivious advances, and (in creator Kelley's words) \"trades on the currency of his reputation\" as an undefeated trial attorney. As the show's fascinating heart and soul, Alan Shore is a walking contradiction, and Spader plays him perfectly as a charismatic, self-loathing lothario who'll bend the law to suit his higher purposes. Deeply cynical yet fiercely committed to his own complex and compassionate moral code, he's brazenly open about his sexual appetites as he savors the affections of smart, sexy associates Sally Heep (Lake Bell), and Tara Wilson (Rhona Mitra), whose relationship with Shore grows strained as the season progresses.While senior partner Paul Lewiston (Rene Auberjonois), senior associate and ex-Marine Brad Chase (Mark Valley), and junior associate Lori Colson (Monica Potter) struggle to maintain the firm's lofty reputation, the appearance of founding partner Shirley Schmidt (Candice Bergen) elevatesBoston Legalto an even higher plane of serio-comic perfection. A former flame of Denny Crane's, Schmidt arrives in episode 11 (appropriately titled \"Schmidt Happens\") as common-sense negotiator with a rapier wit and a clanking pair of big brass cojones, fully capable of holding her own against the Crane/Shore juggernaut. And while \"An Eye for an Eye\" (episode 5) is a sublime example of Boston Legal's deft combination of lunacy and courtroom complexity, it's the deeper implications of episodes like \"Tortured Souls\" (15) and season finale \"Death Be Not Proud\" (tackling a dubious death sentence in Texas) that cast these rich and wonderful characters into sharper relief, baring their souls and the courage of their convictions.With surprising departures (Lake Bell, in episode 13), new arrivals (Kerry Washington, as new associate Chelina Hall, in episode 15) and stellar guest stars including Larry Miller (as the eccentrically unstable founding partner Edwin Poole), Philip Baker Hall, Frances Fisher, Carl Reiner, Freddie Prinze Jr., Shelley Long, and late-season regular Betty White,Boston Legalgained a large and loyal following with exceptional writing, timely social relevance, and that rare quality of chemistry that guarantees long-term appeal. Nowhere is this more apparent than the now-famous Spader/Shatner \"balcony scenes\" that quickly became an episode-closing tradition, with staunch Republican Denny Crane and passionate Democrat Alan Shore reflecting upon their careers, current issues, and their own devoted friendship over brandy and cigars. With these two actors together, virtually every episode ends on a high note of pensive introspection, and Boston Legal becomes even greater than the sum of its parts. DVD extras are minimal (two featurettes with cast and producers, plus deleted scenes from episode 1) but enjoyably worthwhile.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000HT3P56", "B000RO6JZE", "B001B18716", "B001SMC9IU", "B00HNGC516", "B000O77SOK", "B000TGURZ8", "B00369ERC4", "B003INBNV6", "B002KQ6UE2", "B00GHH9HUE", "B00003CXND", "B0006FFRR0", "B0027CSMY0", "B00HRUQA6O", "B002KQ6UDS", "B0006IIPLM", "B0000WN1N6", "B00005JLF3", "B00188XHF8", "B000M9BSBO", "B001OQCVCE", "B000TM1CL0", "B00005JLIC", "6305922675", "B00005JLFT", "B000A2X4BK", "B006WK4Y6I", "B0002NY8R6", "B0002DRDY6", "B0013DZNAA", "B000GPPNO2", "B00DMI56CY", "B00EIXWMII", "B0055SNHQG", "B000RF7XZ8", "B001BN4WK4", "B003YLM794", "B000E8JO2S", "B0012CJQY6", "B0006N2EZA", "B0002WZN9Y", "B00FZ2NTOM", "B009OE2ODY", "B000YKYT1M", "B000FS9MY2", "B00BC5I6Q2", "B00I80DG6O", "B003L77G10", "B003R0MF1W", "B0006N2EZK", "B00KTFJ7UA", "B00CYQXFP0", "B0079IEPHA", "B00ECGHM5O", "B00D2UMHQU", "B00096S480", "B000BX0VU0", "B00IWTVDUW", "B0081QF6QS", "B000EHSVC8", "B00H1RMWYW", "B00005JNJ1", "B00GOC74RU", "B0010SAGHS", "B003FSTN52", "B00I86MQF0", "B006WK4Y8Q", "B004ODLUIA", "B007BMIGMO", "B000NDEXK2", "B007MDB6Y2", "B0053O89YM", "B005PYL4VU", "B0018CWEZI", "B005LAIIQC", "B00D8LMU7E", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B000LE16VC", "B00J5LXT44", "B00GTZWZ1M", "6304711905", "B00915G6R6", "B007PKSO2Y", "B00GWJIDFW", "0790731886", "B00915G6Q2", "B0024FAD8S", "B00FRILRL6", "B00HUPC5X8", "B00HNTOYRQ", "B001XRLWPQ", "B00018D3RI", "B000R7HRRA", "B00D2UMHVA", "B008IFXM4A", "B00I4581F4", "B009LDD1H6", "B00HQLZCIQ"], "bought_together": ["B000HT3P56", "B000RO6JZE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0027CSMY0", "B000HT3P56", "B001SMC9IU", "B000RO6JZE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 18133}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 18.58, "brand": "TCFHE", "asin": "B000EHSVBE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51KMSQQBH2L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Boston Legal - Season One"}
{"description": "It seems no one has ever had an unkind word forYellow Sky, yet somehow this handsome, hard-edged, and very well-made late-'40s Western remains little-known.  That may change with its release on a DVD so crisp and luminous, one wants to swear off Technicolor and luxuriate in the frosty glow of its highlights, the velvet blackness of its shadows, and the electric silver-gray of its desert skies.Story's pretty good, too.  Seven men led by Gregory Peck ride into a small Southwest town, wet their whistles at the saloon, then hold up the bank with a minimum of fuss.  Escaping should be a cinch, except for a troop of cavalry who reduce their number to six and watch the survivors ride off into a desert they probably won't live to cross.  Unexpected salvation looms in the form of Yellow Sky, a ghost town where the bandits find water, an old man (James Barton) and his tomboy granddaughter (Anne Baxter)--and the tempting rumor of gold.  That's when the real trouble starts.  The criminal partnership is severely strained by greed, several varieties of lust (for the girl as well as the treasure), the troublesome onset of conscience in some breasts and its total absence from others--notably Richard Widmark's.Yellow Skyre-teams director William A. Wellman and writer-producer Lamar Trotti, who five years earlier had madeThe Ox-Bow Incident, an authentic but rather pretentious Western classic.Yellow Sky's opening scene is all but lifted fromOx-Bow(along with two character actors), but this time around, Wellman eschews self-importance and just concentrates on spinning a gritty yarn (from a novel by W.R. Burnett).  Apart from sequences shot in Death Valley, the principal location is Yellow Sky itself, a grand ruin set against the timeless backdrop of the Alabama Hills.  And oh yes, the man responsible for those awesome whites, blacks, and silver-grays is Joe MacDonald, the cinematographer ofMy Darling Clementine.--Richard T.

{"description": "The legend of Pocahontas and John Smith receives a luminous and essential retelling by maverick filmmaker Terrence Malick. The facts of Virginia's first white settlers, circa 1607, have been told for eons and fortified by Disney's animated films: explorer Smith (Colin Farrell) and the Native American princess (newcomer Q'orianka Kilcher) bond when the two cultures meet, a flashpoint of curiosity and war lapping interchangeably at the shores of the new continent. Malick, who took a twenty year break between his second and third films (Days of Heaven and The Thin Red Line), is a master of film poetry; the film washes over you, with minimal dialogue (you see characters speak on camera for less than a quarter of the film). The rest of the words are a stream-of-consciousness narration--a technique Malick has used before but never to such degree, creating a movie you feel more than watch. The film's beauty (shot in Virginia by Emmanuel Lubezki) and production design (by Jack Fisk) seems very organic, and in fact, organic is a great label for the movie as a whole, from the dreadful conditions of early Jamestown (it makes you wonder why Englishman would want to live there) to the luminescent love story. Malick is blessed with a cast that includes Wes Studi, August Schellenberg, Christopher Plummer, and Christian Bale (who, curiously, was also in the Disney production). Fourteen-year-old Kilcher, the soul of the film, is an amazing find, and Farrell, so often tagged as the next big thing, delivers his first exceptional performance since his stunning debut in Tigerland. James Horner provides a fine score, but is overshadowed by a Mozart concerto and a recurring prelude from Wagner's Das Rheingold, a scrumptious weaving of horns fit to fuel the gentle intoxication of this film. Note: the film was initially 150 minutes, and then trimmed to 135 by Malick before the regular theatrical run. It was also the first film shot in 65mm since Kenneth Branagh's Hamlet. --Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000NOKFHQ", "B000VMIILU", "B000TXNDV6", "B00005PJ8T", "1573623903", "B000UVV24M", "B005LLX582", "B000MGB6NM", "B005KQVE1S", "B000FIHN5M", "B00CX7OW1G", "B003M987QK", "B0012Q732O", "B00003CXBH", "B0009PW4EQ", "B0002Y4PPK", "B005HV6Y5W", "B003LL3FIY", "B00J11U54K", "B004UOHNIY", "B000VKL6ZM", "B00KHWSB5M", "B0001I55YW", "B002O3Z50Q", "B00005QW6V", "0783231202", "B00004XPPG", "B00003CXAF", "B000ARXF8W", "B001MZ5W3M", "B003EYVXRS", "B00406UK7S", "B000A2WP7O", "B00I6JODGO", "B004AOECXI", "B000AARKOO", "B000J4QWMC", "B002GHHHHO", "B0018BD9DA", "B004C45AZU", "B000CQLZ0Q", "B0013D8LC2", "B003EYVXXW", "B0007UDC80", "B000R9U3B0", "B007PXYWNQ", "B0032LV4LS", "B003Y5H5FG", "B00019330O", "B0000TANUI", "B000UJ48SQ", "B00007GZYC", "B000F7CMRM", "B00005JKTP", "B0002YLCG0", "B004P2VQZC", "B002O3Z510", "B006ISJQ26", "B009AMAJPA", "B00009MEKN", "B007WZTMCI", "B003L20IG0", "B000CEV3P0", "B0002DRDBY", "B000ZOXDFA", "B000ASDFF4", "B00AEBB89W", "B00AEFXVCU", "B008220C38", "B00005JLX2", "B007REV4LQ", "B009INAI02", "B000XR9L50", "B005LAII3A", "B00005OSJN", "B002DHACT2", "B00BB67UNW", "B008JFUNKU", "B00005R23V", "B00140PK82", "B00005221M", "B000087F0X", "B00G4Q3KOC", "B004EPYZT4", "B003UYUQZW", "B00AEFY5B6", "B004CQZFH6", "B002ZG977Y", "0800177967", "B001L57ZZG", "B00DL48BM6", "B001JIE7JC", "B003Y7F1OG", "B000N3SU92", "B000NIVJF4", "B001KO1BCQ", "B005J7K9BO", "B000LC55F2", "B0045HCJ9O"], "bought_together": ["B000NOKFHQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000NOKFHQ", "B00005PJ8T", "B005LLX582", "B000VMIILU"]}, "price": 10.08, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 386879}, "asin": "B000EOTTTU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/519FGGE3C5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The New World"}

{"description": "Battle In Heaven, Carlos Reygadas&#x92; follow-up toJap&#xF3;n, opens with a controversial oral sex scene involving beauty, Ana (Anapola Mushkadiz), and the beast, Marcos (Marcos Hern&#xE1;ndez). Marcos is Ana&#x92;s chauffeur, who has kidnapped and accidentally killed a baby. Ana, a general&#x92;s daughter by day and a prostitute by night, confides in Marcos and performs sexual favors for him in order to persuade him to turn himself in. She is too young, however, to understand Marcos&#x92;s confused mental state, and her sensitive position with him puts her in peril. Set in Mexico City, this tragic drama is as much about failed intimacy as it is about Mexican class structure, as Ana and Marcos attempt to bridge the class gap. A few explicit sex scenes show Marcos in bed with Ana or his wife (Bertha Ruiz), thus garnering it reviews that compare it toThe Brown Bunny. In fact, the slow pacing and artsy, self-consciously composed shots do remind one ofThe Brown Bunny, in that both films are initially interesting but grow dull as their plots take forever to unfold. An intriguing plot is buried under seemingly eternal panoramic shots of the city, painfully slow conversation between characters, and constant close-ups of Marcos&#x92; face that are meant to capture his angst but only deter narrative. Nevertheless, this film&#x92;s merit is based in its experimental energy, and any director who follows up a graphic sex scene with a cut to the waving of the country&#x92;s flag (in this case Mexico&#x92;s) has my respect.--Trinie Dalton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002C8YSDI", "B000FZEQB4", "B00CQ8HCUK", "B0076ANKUY", "B00C8CQ5SO", "B00INUK5WM", "B001AZKB8K", "B00JVQ7QTM", "B000BGH29K", "B00003JRAV", "B0015FHDWM", "B000L6S92E", "B003XKNGNW", "B004GBMVTW", "B00APUAKYG", "B003B2UK1S", "B006Z7Z3VS", "B000FZEQCS", "B0009VRHLK", "B00GPPXNIK", "B002R3CQDC", "B00GRZPRB4", "B00K0MM4AM", "B003W2XOTW", "B0007TZHWA", "B00JDOQM38", "B00023P4I8", "B00FZA2YAE", "B00CQ8HCSM", "B002N7SX8E", "B00GPPXNQ2", "B00009W0U4", "B005DU58QS", "B00AYGVCCK", "B003KGBISE", "B00B0LKUKI", "B00DRJ9G4M", "B000F0UUD2", "B000OYNVOO", "B0002DB52M", "B0026LYMAU", "B0001KL58U", "B00JJ3EHCG", "B0002KQNPO", "B001NY43KA", "B00005K9O8", "B00JDOQMH4", "B00IA1VQBS", "B003ODKZTQ", "B002JCYSL4", "B000059XTM", "B000LAZDQA", "B001AIQ14A", "B002T4GY4Q", "B0004Z32NI", "B0009XRZQK", "B00DPUB56U", "B0048FQFFM", "B00A7WHL08", "B00BLQBQYQ", "B003R9IET0", "B005HWAOLQ", "B00005U14H", "B003D3367U", "B00GS08Y3Q", "B007PZ6STK", "B000DZ95MG", "B001TR4G7G", "B000Q7ZKX4", "B00CFK5J9U", "B00368PSNC", "B000RJEI84", "B001CIOCNK", "B00H0EN948", "B004SEUJEG", "B00AKLLSNC", "B002DQSKMY", "B00FHZDDH0", "B001M9ELV2", "B0000714E8", "B00GA9F2PI", "B00HE010QM", "B00B0LL0E8", "B00DDXEJDA", "B00003CXXY", "B00GU05MXE", "B00GBT6332", "B001PYD0KW", "B000TXPXAU", "B000LV6OAS", "B0040J1RX6", "B00005JMIJ", "B00B022GVS"], "bought_together": ["B00CQ8HCUK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00GPPXNIK", "B002C8YSDI", "B003B2UK1S", "B00005JMIJ"]}, "price": 17.78, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 57073}, "asin": "B000EZ8ZRG", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5100EE4ZKZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Battle In Heaven"}

{"description": "Say \"Warner Bros. in the '30s\" and you're talking, first and foremost, about the tough, gritty, urban, street-smart movies that help define that American decade for us.  Which means you're talking about James Cagney, Edward G. Robinson, and Humphrey Bogart: unpretty but charismatic guys with lived-in faces, and bodies that always seemed cocked, ready to spring.  When one of them entered a room, he owned it, no matter how many people were there already.  Their most celebrated habitat was the gangster picture.  The genre didn't originate with them, but they, more than anybody else, defined it, gave it a face and a silhouette and a heartbeat.The films in this set were produced half a decade and more afterLittle CaesarandThe Public Enemymade stars of Robinson and Cagney, respectively, and after repeal had begun to lend Prohibition the patina of nostalgia.  The studio's gangster franchise was evolving, and so were the careers of its top stars.  When it came to toughness, the boys could still dish it out, and take it, too.  But increasingly they were doing it on the other side of the law-and-order divide.Cagney was first to reform.  In 1935's\"G\" Menhe plays a lawyer put through college by the avuncular neighborhood crimelord.  After a law-school pal turned F.B.I. agent is murdered, Cagney abandons his (resolutely legit) one-man practice and joins the Bureau.  The film memorializes several big moments in F.B.I. legend, but what's grabbiest is the personal drama growing out of Cagney's lingering underworld friendships.  William Keighley directs the murders and shootouts with jolting ferocity, Barton MacLane and Edward Pawley supply flavorful villainy, and there are times when Sol Polito's cinematography literally glows (all these films have been restored, but\"G\" Menlooks especially terrific).  One gripe: The movie should have been presented without the F.B.I.-classroom intro tacked on for 1949 reissue (which belongs under \"Special Features\").InEach Dawn I Die(also Keighley, 1939), Cagney teams with George Raft making his Warners debut.  It's mostly a prison picture, with muckraking reporter Cagney behind bars after being framed by crooked politicos.  Career felon Raft has little sympathy for him till Cagney proves to be a stand-up guy, whereupon the two bond in mutual loathing of sadistic guards, rat-fink convicts, and the endlessly malleable system. The movie boasts one indelible scene (involving a movie screening for the cons), some evocative prison workhouse detailing, and a fine Cagney performance as always.  But it's undone by a script cluttered with melodrama and contrivance.Bullets or Ballots(Keighley yet again, 1936) is much more satisfying.  Again we get two icons for the price of one, with Robinson as a tough but square-shooting police detective and Bogart as the ambitious number-two man to a big-time racketeer.  Bogart's effectively the co-star, albeit fourth-billed behind Robinson, Joan Blondell, and Barton MacLane. But it's Eddie G.'s movie, and he walks the line beautifully as an honest cop who, unjustly jettisoned from the force, signs on with the mobster he's long pursued.  Despite a rhetorical reference to \"ballots\" as the public's means of combatting crime, it's bullets that get the job done. Bullets and fists: the movie makes clear that Robinson has beaten confessions out of people plenty of times, just as it has no illusions about the empty symbolism of crime commissions and grand juries.The only other Bogart vehicle in the set isSan Quentin(Lloyd Bacon, 1937), a scrap-work effort below the standards of everybody involved.  Bogart's a small-time crook whose arrest at a nightclub occasions a meet-cute for his big sister Ann Sheridan and Army training officer Pat O'Brien--who's on his way to become yard captain at the penitentiary where Bogart will be interred!  O'Brien tries to reform the lad, but with corrupt/sadistic guard Barton MacLane on one side and sociopathic con Joe Sawyer on the other, Bogart never has a chance. Neither does the viewer.Lloyd Bacon, normally one of Warners' zippiest directors, is back on his game withA Slight Case of Murder(1938), a delicious gangstercomedy.  Robinson plays beer baron Remy Marco, who craves respectability as a legitimate businessman once beer is legal again. Problem is, nobody has ever had the heart to tell him his product tastes like varnish, and soon the bank is out to foreclose on his brewery.  At which point Remy learns that his summer home upstate is full of fresh gangland corpses....  Based on a play by Damon Runyon and Howard Lindsay, the picture gives a trio of glorious goons--Allen Jenkins, Edward Brophy, and Harold Huber--a rare chance to shine as Marco's house staff.City for Conquest(1940) ought to be the showpiece here.  It's the longest and most ambitious entry, with prestige-picture scale and production values (including Polito and James Wong Howe as cameramen) and a cast including Cagney, Ann Sheridan, Arthur Kennedy, Frank McHugh, Donald Crisp, Anthony Quinn, Jerome Cowan, and--in his first of only two film performances--future directorial giant Elia Kazan.  Working-stiff Cagney loves his gifted musician brother (Kennedy) and childhood sweetheart (Sheridan), a dancer with her own aspirations for the limelight; he becomes a boxer in order to pay for the brother's musical education.  Triumph and tragedy ensue.  The film's avowed aim, and Kennedy's, is to create an urban symphony of New York and the many little people striving against all odds to rise; there's even a one-man Greek chorus--Frank Craven, the Stage Manager of the recentOur Town--to hammer the theme periodically.

{"description": "WithDon't Come Knocking, Wim Wenders revisits territory, both literal and metaphorical, first explored inParis, Texas. Not only does he return to the Southwest, but Sam Shepard is back as co-writer. This time, he's also the star. His Howard Spence is a movie cowboy who's had enough. One day while working in Monument Valley, he takes off his boots and hops a train to Nevada to see his mother (Eva Marie Saint, lovely as ever). Little does he know that Sutter (Tim Roth), a by-the-books bondsman, is hot on his trail. Next, Spence travels to Montana where a sad young woman named Sky (Sarah Polley) is recovering from a recent death, while an angry young man named Earl (Gabriel Mann), who sounds much like Chris Isaak, plies the troubadour trade. Spence doesn't know it yet, but they're the results of a rambunctious past that will soon \"come knocking,\" as it were. While in Butte, he also catches up with Doreen (Jessica Lange), a lover from many moons ago. Clearly,Don't Come Knockingis Wenders and Shepard in a reflective mood, even more so than inParis, Texas, as Spence is older and has more regrets than Harry Dean Stanton's Travis. It doesn't leave as much of an impression, but the film is a worthy addition to the post-modern Western canon. Shot by Franz Lustig, it's frames are filled with intense hues--fiery reds, glowing greens--and a plaintive score by T-Bone Burnett.--Kathleen C.

{"description": "\"If it ain't broke, don't fix it\" was clearly comedian Bob Newhart and company's motto during the fourth season (1975-76) ofThe Bob Newhart Show, all  24 episodes of which are preserved in this three-disc set. Even with the show's ratings dipping somewhat, there's no shark-jumping going on here; Newhart and producers Jay Tarses and Tom Patchett clearly understood what made this show tick, and notwithstanding a little tinkering, they stuck with it. \"It,\" of course, largely depended on Newhart himself. A brilliant reactor, he continues to bring his array of deadpan takes and brilliant, understated timing to the part of Chicago psychologist Bob Hartley, who's surrounded by the usual group of family (primarily Suzanne Pleshette as wife Emily), friends (Peter Bonerz as best bud Jerry Robinson), neighbors (Bill Daily as the tactless Howard Borden), staff (Marcia Wallace is always a riot as receptionist Carol Kester), patients (Jack Riley is the standout as the neurotic Mr. Carlin, but they're all good), and various guest stars (including Rene Auberjonois, Tom Poston, and Lawrence Pressman). Carol gets married a few episodes in, and Emily is promoted to vice-principal at her school, but these are largely cosmetic changes that do little to alter the series' overall tone.Aside from Newhart himself, props are due to the writers. As always,The Bob Newhart Show's humor is mostly low-key, with none of the raunch, tasteless sexual innuendo, and flamboyant idiocy of today's sit-coms. What's more, subjects as serious as death (\"The Longest Good-bye\" and \"Death of a Fruitman\"), obesity (\"Heavyweights,\" in which Bob presides over a workshop for \"people of the hefty persuasion\"), professional ethics (\"Who is Mr. X?\"), and jealousy on the job (\"A Matter of Vice-Principal\") are broached without ever becoming sententious or heavy-handed. Of course, three decades after the fact, some things will seem a little dated: the clothes are cringe-worthy, and it's hard to imagine anyone these days getting away with describing Beirut as a place where \"everybody looks like Danny Thomas.\" Still, Newhart's show remains one of the best of the several great sit-coms that emerged in the '70s. Bonus features include commentary (by Newhart and others) on five episodes, a gag reel, and a featurette.--Sam Graham", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000E6ES9Y", "B000A9QKSM", "B000YKYT1M", "B000BOH8YQ", "B0011N19HI", "B003VTKZ84", "B000EXDS02", "B002WN8IR0", "B00GHH9HW2", "B00096S480", "B00HNGC56G", "B00005JLIC", "B00JHH1VUU", "B006VC3LDO", "B000G6BLDI", "B00HRUQB5O", "B00H8KC1N4", "B00KTZALDC", "B000EQ5PTQ", "B001OXLGK0", "B00FM4S7P4", "B001DHXT52", "B001O4KBN2", "B00274SIVK", "B003CNQPME", "B00GOC74QG", "B000Z27H8Q", "B000N2HD6O", "B000LXGXY8", "B002PQ7JR4", "B000NTMA1U", "B000F8O2MO", "B000291Q3O", "B000A0GOP0", "B000M343B2", "B000XJD3K2", "B0014FAIXO", "B00G5N6C8U", "B000Y7U9AK", "B000MGTQ6G", "B000BGR1B4", "B000EBGE82", "B0019BI114", "B00IF0KAYS", "B000BYRCF6", "B00BHWG0N6", "B004083REE", "B0014FAIYS", "B00FM4S8IU", "B0030BS1E8", "B000B6CODY", "B005DCJ0Q0", "B004WO9OMA", "B001GMH8WE", "B000HWZ4IY", "B006363QHE", "B0007TKG76", "B000WQWPSW", "B000G0O5J6", "B000UX6TLG", "B0009UC80Q", "B000FSME10", "B002C8YSBU", "B0001IN0BC", "B000QUEQ6I", "B0011FLGYM", "B000M343AS", "B001P9N9B2", "B0041SI7B6", "B001JTRKHW", "B009TTGLJ2", "B000PGTPC8", "B0007WFY4S", "B001JFKWE4", "B000BF0C8E", "B000CCBCCG", "B000E3L7EQ", "B00GLT2SOA", "B0001NBNIY", "B000E3L7FK", "B0031XYLR6", "B004MWLXTY", "B002E58FTM", "B001O4KBP0", "B002FLOTFO", "B0006IUDYY", "B00GLPYVT4", "B000MQ4WMY", "B00IZ27GD4", "B000H6SY28", "B0025KVNOU", "B0009IWGOG", "B00JDCP0QA", "B000TD2KY2", "B000CELOVI", "B0009UC7MK", "B00HW3LG3S", "B0006N2EZA"], "bought_together": ["B000E6ES9Y", "B000A9QKSM"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000YKYT1M", "B000A9QKSM", "B00HRUQB5O", "B000E6ES9Y"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 36101}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 14.95, "brand": "TCFHE", "asin": "B000G6BL7O", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515Y74F2MQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Bob Newhart Show: Season 4"}
{"description": "As long as human beings have conceived of an underworld, they have sought to represent it in art. Nobuo Nakagawa's 1960 filmJigokujoins this artistic niche alongside Dante'sInfernoandMonkeybonestarring the great Brendan Fraser. The story, meant primarily to provide a frame from which to hang a series of creepy set designs, concerns a college student, Shiro Shimizu (Shigeru Amachi) who flees a hit-and-run accident. Even though he wasn't the one driving, Shiro is plagued with guilt, which begins to interfere with his courtship of Yukiko (Utako Mitsuya), whose father just happens to be a theology professor who lectures on Buddhist concepts of Hell. The first half of the film sets the stage for the cast's decent into Hell, where things start to getreallyfreaky. Lit with sickly blue and red light, Nakagawa's vision of the afterworld is bleak and expressionistic. In one scene, lovers struggle to come together across a field of jagged glass shards. In another, the damned run across fields of wriggling hands and feet. Perhaps most disturbing, many of those condemned to an eternity of suffering find their heads and wrists shackled in what appear to be boards in the shape of coffin lids. It's no wonder audiences of the time were scared witless. For a contemporary viewer, however, it's easier to observe the film as an exercise in creative cinematography and a precursor to the J-horror genre. More than the imagery, it&#x92;s this subgenre's roots in spirituality that give it the power to chill, with the implication that we bring torture upon ourselves with our own moral violations.The Criterion Collection does its usual fine job presenting the disc with plenty of extras. The \"Building the Inferno\" featurette is an amusing glimpse into the working methods of the enigmatic--and hard-drinking--Nakagawa, considered by many in Japan a third-tier director. It's hard to tell whether the transfer itself or the original film is too dark--one is inclined to believe the latter; many of the pre-Hell scenes are blackened to the point of making it hard to see who's doing what. But no one should expect anything light and sunny from this DVD.--Ryan Boudinot", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00019JR5Y", "B00004W3HF", "B005D0RDPM", "B003WKL6XA", "B000PKG6O4", "B008Y5OXDI", "B00B2BYXSQ", "B002E01MBA", "B00HVOFP6W", "B00005NFZC", "B0007CNY0E", "B00B2BYXYA", "B00HE01030", "B00687XNNK", "B0000A02TW", "B002AFX53W", "B000AQKUD6", "B000C6NP7M", "B0006HC0FU", "B00JVQ7QTM", "B00005JLV7", "B0002V7O0Q", "078002205X", "B000PKG6OY", "B00B2BYXWM", "B00CEIOHPU", "B006H3KQSK", "B000BB14I0", "B0019X4008", "B001VG2MAI", "B0009WIE2A", "B00K5EJHGO", "B0012SY0E6", "B001PYD0KW", "B00008RH14", "B0007989YS", "B00I099JY6", "B000NY1E9E", "B000BB14IA", "B000NOK0GW", "B00065GX0K", "B00I099JWI", "B00009MEA0", "B002ZG4Q5W", "B007N5YJZM", "B0001UZZSG", "B008Y5OWO8", "B005D0RDCU", "B000MM0LE6", "B00687XNQM", "B000BR6QCI", "B00GOT1DIE", "B00009MEA3", "B000AQKUC2", "B00065GX64", "B005VU9LO0", "B0026VBOJM", "B000093NR0", "B0007GAG42", "B00J2PQYY0", "B0016AKSOQ", "B00I3C1T7A", "B000067IY6", "B001TIQT7A", "B005D0RDRA", "B00GBT62N8", "B000V6LSZY", "B00EO2I6OM", "B000VUQ4HW", "B001BEK8E2", "B00005EBSF", "B000VARC3C", "B00I462XNO", "B00007CVS3", "B000305ZYS", "B00007L4I7", "B000MTEFP0", "B000K0YLX2", "B00HVOFP62", "B004M66YUS", "B00092ZLEY", "B00CEIOH8C", "B000VARC32", "B003WKL6X0", "B000HT3QBE", "B000067IY4", "B00B2BYY1M", "B008CB8CJK", "B00005JLEJ", "B009VO9XSG", "B00260LDSU", "B00A8QDI3M", "B001PYD0M0", "B0016AKSOG", "B006X64RRM", "B000K0YM0Y", "B005152C7S", "B00005JLMU", "B00005M2C7", "0780023099"], "bought_together": ["B00019JR5Y", "B00004W3HF"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00004W3HF", "B00019JR5Y", "B005D0RDPM", "B003WKL6XA"]}, "price": 26.18, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 78975}, "asin": "B000G8NY1I", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51YPMJM3EAL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Jigoku (The Criterion Collection)"}

{"description": "In any successful murder mystery, the personality of the sleuth is as important as the puzzle solved--andJonathan Creekhas two of the most charming detectives in recent memory. A reclusive, socially maladept inventor of illusions for a professional magician, Jonathan Creek (stand-up comedian Alan Davies) gets drawn into the investigations of pushy journalist Madeline \"Maddy\" Magellan (Caroline Quentin,Men Behaving Badly) whenever Maddy confronts something seemingly impossible: When a man shoot himself in a sealed underground bomb shelter, but his crippling arthritis makes it impossible for him to pull the trigger, as in one episode; or when a girl disappears when she enters an aging rock star's house--but the rock star himself, who's been chained to a radiator in the entry room by burglars, insists he never saw the girl come through the door; or when a scientist is stabbed in the back in a locked room in a house full of monkeys. Creek gathers the clues and, knowing that seamless mysteries can be the result of improbable effort, susses out the sometimes preposterous solutions while he and Maddy flirt in the most awkward, neurotic, and utterly true-to-life way. Davies and Quentin are thoroughly engaging actors but do not look like movie stars, and therein lies much of their appeal; the astonishing murders are perfectly balanced by the actors' flesh-and-blood genuineness. The plots are cunning, the dialogue brisk, and the supporting casts dependable, butJonathan Creekrides on the shoulders of its leads, who carry it with magical ease.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000S2XD9A", "B001G1FL4M", "B002PHVHJY", "B003VVBZ7M", "B00662CH02", "B00GHH9I62", "B00IBKXP8A", "B00013D53A", "B004AV5H2G", "B002WN8IS4", "B00GWXI2RM", "B003O97W2I", "B00GWXI1F0", "B009DS5OEM", "B00HHYF55C", "B008KEQLZ6", "B009D4RW96", "B009DS31ZG", "B00JRWDF6I", "B008645ZXY", "B00BDSRM4K", "B000GW8U4A", "B00BQXTCYK", "B00GAXASK8", "B00GD7UO6E", "B00AATFJKC", "B00H4ZEFTQ", "B008CYDDRS", "B00D49YE4W", "B001GTXZOM", "B005SH65S6", "B000FII2Z2", "B00BVMXARG", "B00BVMX4ZY", "B005A1GRSI", "B0011VJRVU", "B00JJRLFTU", "B00C12ZISE", "B00HUAGYF8", "B009VYE656", "B003ZYE932", "B00EV1YZD2", "B00008DDXE", "B009YX8MKO", "B00GWXI20E", "B00GWXI16O", "B00GD7UO4G", "B0050MB3RM", "B00EH4KY2Y", "B008OTTTP6", "B0001DMUF4", "B00CLB7CFM", "B00D7AM2PQ", "B00BQXTCVS", "B00447G2NE", "B000VWX6T4", "B00GWXI2MC", "B00A27OJ94", "B0050N0US4", "B00GAXASLC", "B00A8KJLPM", "B004HHX9H8", "B004AV5H3U", "B00D49YBTA", "B005K8QIS0", "B00IBKXQJS", "B0083HXKAY", "B00HGE90Z4", "B00J3M54AW", "B00IT3KP96", "B005XLFBEG", "B00GAHJO8G", "B00C888LOO", "B005DVIPY4", "B005N8KP3Q", "B006O2S63G", "B00DW5IKN4", "B009DS3VQA", "B000S6LP5K", "B00BVMXC4W", "B00429MLZC", "B00D49YDDY", "B006JY3OH2", "B00A0HT99G", "B005GP7EVC", "B001T21R6Y", "B00A27O5AW", "B00BCXW106", "B00268EY5Q", "B00K6DQGC2", "B00D7AM2YW", "B000068UE9", "B00GD7UMDO", "B00FPPQYXM", "B00DC5JZTW", "B002RB56ZY", "B00EH4L3X8", "B000FDECH4", "B00AHREQMY"], "bought_together": ["B000S2XD9A", "B001G1FL4M"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003ZYE932", "B003VVBZ7M", "B001G1FL4M", "B000S2XD9A"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 68706}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 28.28, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B000GYI3MW", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51G81HAX3YL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Jonathan Creek - Season One"}

Intelligence services around the region are up-in-arms about the daring and deadly theft. But due to the sensitive and illegal nature of the cargo, the United States cannot get directly involved. When it is discovered that the pirate originally came from North Korea, the South Koreans send in special agent Gang Se-jong (Lee Jung-jae). Gang Se-jong chases the Sin (Jang Dong-gun) all over the region, as he frantically tries to piece together what happened and get the guidance systems back. Along the way, Gang learns about Sin's wretched story--how he fled North Korea with his family, but were all killed in China except for his sister. Blaming North and South Korea for his family's deaths, Sin has dedicated himself to destroying both countries. In a ship in the Yellow Sea, between Korea and China, Sin is planning a treacherous scheme that will painfully kill millions all across the Korean Peninsula. Now, with two typhoons converging and Sin's ship of death ready to launch its terrible secret, only Gang Se-jong has a chance of preventing this cataclysmic act of terror. The fate of both Koreas hangs in the balance.\n\nCast: Jang Dong-Kun, Lee Jung-Jae, Lee Mi-Yeon", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 752376}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "asin": "B000HC87CO", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/317aDMZO9AL.jpg", "title": "Typhoon"}

The rubbery face of Marlon Wayans (White Chicks) is digitally transposed onto the body of an actual midget so that Marlon can play Calvin, a bad-tempered thief who's trying to retrieve a humongous diamond from the purse of Vanessa (Kerry Washington,Ray), the buppie wife of Darryl (Shawn Wayans,Scary Movie 2). Darryl doesn't care about his wife's new promotion, he just wants to have a child--and he gets one when Calvin arrives on his doorstep dressed in baby clothes. At which point, the kicks, head-butts, and blunt object trauma to the groin begin. It's beside the point to argue whether or not this is definitively funny; blows to the groin either make you laugh or they don't, and if they do, you know who you are and you should seek this movie out. It will give you all you could possibly ask for, including numerous jokes about bodily functions and breasts.

{"description": "A remake of the Italian filmL'Ultimo Bacio,The Last Kisswas largely ignored in theaters despite its Gen-X themes and appeal of star Zach Braff (Scrubs), who last made a splash in theaters with his similar twentysomething angst filmGarden State. A drama about midlife crises (mostly for people approaching 30, that is), director Tony Goldwyn (A Walk on the Moon) has assembled a top-notch cast, but there's not enough likeability in the characters to care. Architect Michael (Zach Braff) is a commitmentphobe who wanders into a flirtation with coed Kim (Rachel Bilson) because he's gun-shy about settling down with his perfect girlfriend Jenna (Jacinda Barrett), who's expecting his child. His fellow pals face their own romantic crossroads; one (Michael Weston) desires to settle down with a woman who doesn't love him back; another (Eric Christian Olsen) can't find someone who just wants a meaningless fling like him; and the third (Casey Affleck), ponders leaving his weary wife who's constantly berating his shortcomings as a father. Most depressing is Jenna's mother (Blythe Danner), who's tired of feeling neglected by her stoic husband (Tom Wilkinson). Danner and Wilkinson are compelling as longtime marrieds who've lost their spark, but Braff's character is wholly unlikeable, even aside from his indiscretions. The bright spot is Bilson, in her first movie role, utterly adorable as the sexy college student who's got more parts vulnerability and sass than any stuck in the Other Woman role. There's some fine acting inThe Last Kiss, but not enough character development to care about anything they're going through.The DVD includes a commentary featuring cast members Braff, Barrett, Olsen, Bilson, and director Goldwyn, who all mainly hoot during Olsen's sex scenes and ogle Bilson's seductive dancing. Braff and Goldwyn also imitate Bilson's high-pitched speedchatter throughout, while Barrett educates the cast on the similarities between \"the dingo ate my baby\" and the O.J. Simpson case (don't ask). It's all the more entertaining compared to a separate commentary track with just Goldwyn and Braff, who mostly drones about the music he picked for the film (Remy Zero, Snow Patrol, Aimee Mann) and raves about the minimalist score, done by singer Michael Penn. And oh, they ogle Bilson's dancing in this one too. --Ellen A.

{"description": "Annette Bening is the stand-out highlight in this dysfunctional \"family\" comedy based on the bestselling memoir by Augusten Burroughs. Although fans of the book may be slightly disappointed with the film's uneven and somewhat campy rendition of Burroughs' twisted adolescence in the 1970s, there's plenty of pleasure to be found in the work of an excellent cast led by Bening, who gives a subtle dare-to-hate-me performance as Burroughs' mother Diedre, a would-be poet who's so aloof about her teenage son Augusten (played by fresh-faced newcomer Joseph Cross, fromFlags of Our Fathers) that she allows him to be legally adopted into the eccentric family of her psychiatrist, Dr. Finch (Brian Cox). As the half-crazed Finch overmedicates Diedre into a haze of semi-conscious madness, he also turns Augusten's life upside down while his wife (Jill Clayburgh) and daughters (Gwyneth Paltrow, Evan Rachel Wood) indulge their own eccentricities and Augusten enters into an intimate relationship with one of Finch's adopted patients (played by Joseph Fiennes).As adapted and directed by Nip/Tuck creator Ryan Murphy,Running with Scissorslacks the singular voice of Burroughs' dryly comedic first-person narrative, but even as the film struggles to find a consistent tone, it's so full of wacky behavior that you can't help laughing. It's a messy, patchwork quilt of a movie, blessed by authentically garish '70s production design and a soundtrack of familiar '70s hits. In rendering Burroughs' indelible portrait of weak, irresponsible adults and the people they victimize, Murphy and his well-chosen cast (which also includes Alec Baldwin as Diedre's ex-husband) find moments of touching pathos amidst the madness. For her part, Bening delivers an acclaimed performance that gives the film a dramatic weight it otherwise lacks. The rest is for anyone who enjoys a laugh at the freak-show expense of damaged and damaging characters. --Jeff ShannonStills fromRunning with Scissors(click for larger image)MoreRunning with Scissorson Amazon.comThe BookMore Films staring Annette BeningMore Films about Eccentric Families", "related": {"also_bought": ["031242227X", "125003440X", "031242681X", "0312428278", "0312422288", "0312315953", "0312341911", "0312272057", "B00003CWQR", "0312563558", "B0034G4OZE", "B001TK2BMK", "1250032105", "B000CS464G", "B006G7YSP4", "B000087F7E", "0312315945", "B000JBWWQA", "B000KX0IOK", "B00AEFXESQ", "140006869X", "B00007JXWX", "B00AFEY354", "B00013RC2K", "B0000640VJ", "B00005JMJG", "0312283709", "1427200718", "B00175VSBC", "B0000AC8LR", "B0016MJ6T2", "B00AEFYSWM", "B000EHQU0S", "0307395987", "B00049QQHI", "0312315961", "B002VECLVO", "B004SEUIZG", "6305784817", "B00005Q4CS", "B0007PALGG", "B0006TPE4C", "B00008DP4C", "B00005JLSB", "B00001PE4D", "B00005JLHW", "B000FVQLQQ", "B003L20ICE", "B000N3SU92", "B00004UEDQ", "B0007G89FK", "B000MEYKD2", "B001JIE7JC", "B004FQX5B6", "B0014D5RBE", "B00070EBOY", "B00003CWTI", "B007HRKBI0", "0307396185", "B0057ZAA6W", "B005PTMPYA", "B0041KKYEM", "B00ADRYCWC", "0312938853", "B000F6II1M", "B0001DMVBC", "B0053XZ8O2", "B00008972P", "B0001EFUFK", "B0014GI6I2", "B00DW5IKYS", "B000E33VWW", "B0058ZPNOK", "B006QVRVJK", "B0036TGT8Y", "B00FXWAZW8", "B000QGDY0G", "B004H83IG4", "B005C7SXMS", "B000A7DVR2", "B0016LFG4C", "0800177789", "B002LMV7RA", "B00004TWZH", "B00CC2V7AQ", "B005DI8X3K", "B00EYPJHDI", "B00AEBB9CS", "B00AEFY8MM", "B000H9I1OG", "0316777730", "B00005JLQH", "B000092T3P", "B0043X1FL8", "B0010X8NF0", "B004499LX0", "B00AEFXUXU", "B008N25X7M", "B002DP0J24", "B0007UC8Y4"], "bought_together": ["031242227X", "125003440X"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002HJ3KD6", "125003440X", "1250032105", "B000GQLCQY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 56416}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.5, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B000M5B98A", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51xHRfPC6cL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Running With Scissors"}

Jenny quickly discovers that what she and Jason think is a deserted island is really a quiet beach not far away from the fancy beach resort where they've both been staying. Cherishing some quality time alone with her idol, Jenny begins an elaborate charade to keep Jason believing that they're stranded on a desert island and poses as an accomplished outdoorswoman and provider in hopes that he'll fall madly in love with her. Longtime friend Ryan (Jonathan Bennett) discovers the ruse and reluctantly agrees to help Jenny, but when rival Alexis (Jamie-Lynn DiScala) follows Ryan and discovers Jenny's secret, she's determined to get equal time with Jason and steal him away from Jenny.  A light romantic comedy,Love Wreckedis amusing, if fairly forgettable. Rated PG for sensuality, crude humor, and language.--Tami Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0010X5X4O", "B00175VSBW", "B002GIBVQ6", "B003M8NGKS", "B0048KQQCE", "B00AEBB8R4", "B002GOAH1U", "B000RETOGA", "B000B2YR92", "B000GB775E", "B000MGBLEQ", "B000069HZN", "B00A7E8PA6", "B002TZS5QU", "B000JFY05W", "B000J4QW7W", "B0006SSMWE", "B002WNU0OY", "B0096W4784", "B00062IVN0", "B003B1X85O", "B00005JN0Z", "B000VKL6T8", "B000P0J08S", "B003IISTCW", "B00005JMXO", "B003Y5H52O", "B002WNU0QM", "B004K4FUSE", "B000WC39MM", "B0074B2N2G", "B006X08DZ0", "B00HW3EZZE", "B006IRQUMQ", "B00AEFYWQY", "B0034GK750", "B004EPYZNK", "B009INAK8C", "B0024NSFYO", "B00DMDE02Q", "B005EJIG62", "B000CGXLTE", "B00005K3OS", "B004CYVZ4K", "B0006GAOCW", "B0007LXPBS", "B000FCW15A", "B0027CHPD4", "B0007US7C6", "B00JRE9TBG", "B0018PH3LA", "B009H3LP82", "B00JQF7ZR6", "B00898M1QG", "B00005JM9Q", "B0011N1WE8", "B001Y8DJVE", "B000YDMPA6", "B0009JE57G", "B000F48D5A", "B0041KKYHY", "B00BNAE6M4", "B001OQCUYI", "B004IN75DU", "B000FUTVV4", "B00AEFYMBO", "B0013K2ZFY", "B001K2LFNI", "B000CDSS0Y", "B0036TGSIK", "B007I8KXDQ", "B00006ZXSL", "B004SIP9X8", "B001H1I8KK", "B0018CNNV2", "B005ELVCS4", "6305870179", "B002DOBGWM", "B0038N9X3Q", "B002ZG989G", "B0035ECHTK", "B00180OU7U", "B000067D8T", "B003B3V0N4", "B0055HK6VQ", "B0035JHYNO", "B0077PBPTG", "B007K7IAVC", "B002ZG975Q", "B00003CXGJ", "B005Z9MFRC", "B001BPJJ96", "B002ZG988M", "B0099116S6", "B000ERVJHW", "B001AR012O", "B0000CDRVU", "B00005JPQE", "B008N25XAE", "B0015U0QVW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0010X5X4O", "B000RETOGA", "B00AEBB8R4", "B00175VSBW"]}, "price": 9.78, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 32473}, "asin": "B000MEYJHE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51yYxpMxrNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Love Wrecked"}
