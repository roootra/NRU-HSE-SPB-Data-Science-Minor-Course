{"description": "From the sun-dappled heartland, a young man (Robert Redford, in soft lighting) emerges as maybe the best baseball player anybody's ever seen. On his way to the majors, he is cut down by an enigmatic black widow (Barbara Hershey) and vanishes for many years. When he reemerges, a silent mystery, he lands a spot with the New York team and begins tearing up the league--he's still the natural. Fans of the Bernard Malamud novel will be dismayed at the pure mythical hokum of this film, but baseball fanatics have been known to watch and rewatch this one; after all, it's constructed as a kind of shrine to the national pastime. Barry Levinson (Rain Man) directs the movie with an unabashed devotion to the game, although the film could use more of the realities of chewing tobacco and pine tar. Redford is fine, and Kim Basinger and Oscar-nominated Glenn Close are effective as the women in his life. The crowning touch is the soaring, extraordinary music by Randy Newman, the singer-songwriter turned orchestral composer.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005M20M", "0783235968", "B000068NNT", "630273973X", "6302534372", "6302415853", "6305132666", "0800121600", "6304291698", "B00004RGUU", "6305126062", "630596260X", "B0000399WO", "6301734734", "6303597874", "6302936381", "B00000I1DI", "6303014100", "076780922X", "B0000048ZL", "6300181472", "0792841786", "0790743159", "0792839846", "5559477621", "6302226899", "6302450179", "6302023742", "B0000068ZQ", "630018224X", "6300183513", "630299005X", "B00004RFFA", "B0000068EE", "630150528X", "6300246965", "B00000JGEI", "B000M5BRX2", "6300215695", "6302360978", "6302909023", "6300181154", "6300184927", "0800179552"], "bought_together": ["B00005M20M", "0783235968"], "also_viewed": ["0783235968", "B000003KMM", "B0000399WO", "6300216810"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 348212}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.79, "brand": "", "asin": "0767809262", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51816SHE4HL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Natural [VHS]"}
{"description": "Shot in English and budgeted higher than any of his previous  Asian features, Jackie Chan's last film under his Hong Kong contract is an  action-packed globe-trotting adventure shot with the American audience  in mind. The spies and secret agent-laden plot is packed with car chases,  explosions, gunfire aplenty, and of course Jackie's own brand of gymnastic martial arts. But the flood of his older films between his hitsRumble in the BronxandRush Hourhad sated American viewers andWho Am I?wound  up being sold directly to cable. It's our loss, for this mix of goofy slapstick and jaw-dropping action is his most impressive film sinceDrunken Master II. Playing a special forces agent (named, naturally, Jackie) struck with amnesia and adopted  by an African bush tribe following a failed assassination attempt, he  embarks on a quest to discover his true identity while armies of killers pour  after him. After an explosive opening, the story gets momentarily bogged down  in the kind of mugging humor that leaves most American audiences  scratching their heads, but once Jackie kicks into gear the film is a high-speed action flurry that culminates in a furious battle atop a Rotterdam skyscraper. Jackie is at his most charmingly naive (he berates the villains, pleading \"Why do you want to destroy when you can make things better?\") and athletically impressive: the marvelous stunts--including a flight down  the side of the skyscraper--and fight choreography makeRush Hourlook like a Sunday drive.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000I2KOB0", "0780619331", "B004U7MR1O", "0767851161", "B000006A17", "0780622677", "B006LOC01G", "B00005YUNV", "B000EWBKIK", "078062260X", "B004SUDQAY", "B00005JL8Z", "B000HC2M3Y", "B00AWHDEIQ", "B000Y11BC6", "B0000SX9N2", "B000UXOM88", "B000BVM1QO", "B0002S64TQ", "B00AWHDFIA", "B000UNYK3U", "B0051SFTGQ", "B004SIP8TS", "B00H4KQMX8", "B002ZG99M2", "B005CFBZFW", "B00HVFA37C", "B00004XMRY", "B000KX0IMW", "B004SUDQ7W", "B000Q7ZKWK", "B002NPY7EA", "B004SUDQ4K", "B005M2AKIS", "B000VUDSH6", "B004SUDPZU", "B004TJWDNA", "B001BEK8HO", "B004SUDQCC", "B004H83IOQ", "B00HVFA322", "B00BNADY8Q", "B000WGYMTC", "B0000TPA2E", "B004SNJ08S", "B00005JLRQ", "B0000640VF", "B005ZMBEXU", "B00003CXJ1", "B005ZMBEXA", "B00008WJE4", "B009INAMEY", "B00008IHUC", "B0001NBMOY", "B00IS402HQ", "B001BEK8GA", "B004TP55XY", "B002GSXKO2", "B009INAEI8", "B003EVAG4C", "B00000F2MG", "B00006672Q", "B00003CY5A", "B005FQ1OOK", "B000I0RNWU", "B004QDW2DA", "B002ZG99MC", "B0051SFS6C", "B003Q7B79M", "B000A2IPQY", "B008WAM2BU", "B004GJYRKA", "B0009VBTQY", "B0080QOL0Q", "B004U7MR0K", "B00ATKH6KS", "B004P8R9O8", "B00D9EJG5E", "B00HSJ2EMI", "B00003CY5Y", "B00JVQ7RCS", "B0000U0X1Q", "B000LC4Z7Q", "B000OT6V64", "0767804252", "B004SO0HMU", "B003INBNXO", "1558908846", "B004SUDPWS", "B000GFLKDU", "B000AYEL3I", "B0018PH3NS", "1558908412", "B00C7E3E96", "B004XVMCPI", "B0000V46DQ", "B00005OOQ1", "0345415035", "B000A9QK9Q", "B00C7E3EBE"], "bought_together": ["0780619331", "B004U7MR1O"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004U7MR1O", "0780619331", "B006LOC01G", "B00005YUNV"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 33641}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.99, "brand": "COL", "asin": "0767819640", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HQ0TADYQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Who Am I?"}

Although it shares a title with Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla, this film is neither a remake or re-imagining of the earlier film.", "related": {"also_bought": ["0767801601", "0767824008", "6302241693", "076780161X", "6303953492", "0767824016", "B000053UWQ", "B000BMY2L0", "0783103107", "B0000039LU", "6303953484", "6304891784", "B0000VAGXK", "B00066KWCY", "6304911734", "B0001AVZ9Y", "B0000VAGXU", "630362572X", "6304911769", "6304911750", "0764001035", "B000003KJX"], "bought_together": ["076780161X"], "also_viewed": ["6302241693", "B00IQAUO5C", "B0000039LT", "B00IQAUO2A", "0767801601", "B00125WAYG", "0783103107", "B00BGAA0SU"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 332250}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 24.44, "brand": "", "asin": "0767823990", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51TM5R3FNNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Godzilla VS.

{"description": "Based on a story by Clive Barker and skillfully written and directed by Bernard Rose,Candymanrises above most horror films by eerily suggesting that some urban legends--in this case a particularly frightening one--have a spooky basis in reality. The legend of the Candyman is a potent one around the high-rise tenements of Chicago's Cabrini-Green housing complex, where the residents speak of a dark, ominous figure who appears when his victims say his name five times in front of a mirror, then mercilessly slashes them to death. Upon learning that the Candyman is rumored to live in one of the vacant tenements, a University of Illinois researcher (Virginia Madsen) investigates a recent murder at Cabrini-Green. She learns that the Candyman (played by Tony Todd) is both unreal and chillingly real--a supernatural force of evil empowered by those who believe in his legend. He is a killer made flesh by the belief of others, and the young researcher's investigation is a threat to his existence. What happens next? We wouldn't dare spoil the chills, but rest assured that writer-director Rose has tapped into a wellspring of urban angst and fear, andCandymanserves up its gruesome frights with a refreshing dose of intelligence.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005K3NZ", "6305622760", "B001B8XRT6", "B000MNOX8U", "B008874968", "B000A6T1ZY", "B004AC6PMG", "B001B1UO6W", "B00005NRN6", "B000GBEWRU", "B000V4UFZK", "B0000AOX0D", "B000I2J68M", "6305972001", "B001B1872A", "B0000AOX0E", "B00006FDCD", "B000FS9FE4", "B001DJLD1W", "B005CFBZQ6", "B000099T3M", "B000RIWAVW", "B005OT810I", "B000MV8ABS", "B000EHRVP6", "B00006IUFV", "B0000AOX0A", "B001NPD9LS", "B000IMUYJM", "B001DJLD0S", "1573628174", "B0052XU4BK", "B003UGLCIA", "B00079Z9WI", "B000PMLJMQ", "B00009PY4G", "B000A2X3U2", "B0053TWVDC", "B002HML6YI", "B00005YUNE", "B00006FDBT", "B000VKL6Z2", "B000MV8AC2", "B001AGNMFI", "B00AEFYV9W", "B00018D42W", "B0013D8LAE", "B0002IQLH6", "B002LMSWN2", "B00005UQ9W", "B000S0GYRU", "B004EI2NP4", "B00AEFYYH6", "B000WC3864", "B0000CEB6Y", "B000FWHW86", "B0053TWVIM", "B006ZL1P66", "B00AEFY2LO", "B000N4RAQU", "B000TSIJWY", "B008CYDD7I", "B000FA57UI", "B0056P6SOG", "B002JT69IW", "B00CERJI5U", "B002ZG971U", "B0001EFV7M", "B002OVO18A", "0767817664", "B00006AUIG", "B005CFBZVG", "B00005NKSC", "B0000D9PNG", "B00005RHGK", "0792839706", "B00005LC4Q", "B004P7CM9Q", "B00JF5GAIW", "B00AQJ8MLY", "B002I41KNC", "B00KDU8HQQ", "B00001QGUM", "B0024FADD8", "B00DTPRZ24", "B001JV5BIA", "B003PIUINI", "B002VWNIDG", "B0021L8UPS", "B004LWZW24", "B003PIUINS", "B000Q66Q2O", "B00005K3NR", "0783230451", "B0006SGYL0", "B00023P4SS", "B0002VYOVS", "B0087ZG7UW", "B005CFBYW6", "B00006FI0R"], "bought_together": ["B00005K3NZ", "6305622760"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001B8XRT6", "6305972001", "B00004TDTO", "B001B1UO6W"]}, "price": 17.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 183485}, "asin": "0767817656", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DGRV60NAL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Candyman"}

{"description": "Director John Singleton (Boyz N the Hood,Rosewood) made an earnest effort in this, his second, film to say a great deal that is true and relevant about living and loving in a violent, difficult time in American history. Janet Jackson plays a beautician and poet who withdraws into herself after her boyfriend is murdered by gangsters. The late Tupac Shakur plays a postman who tries to get through to her, and the two travel on a course through urban America, connecting with family and community. Singleton has so much on his mind that the film comes out a terrible muddle, but there is a certain integrity peeking through the fog. Shakur makes a startlingly good impression in his film debut, and Jackson strips away her star veneer to play something like a real person--and entirely succeeds. Maya Angelou wrote the poems that pass as those penned by Jackson's character, and she also appears in the film.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEFYE08", "B00005JLG1", "B000035P5I", "B002CA68NO", "B00BTYPWDQ", "B00007ELEN", "6305505780", "B00004Y2R1", "B00066FAQW", "B002CA68N4", "B00007BK2R", "1558908390", "B00000JGHV", "B00003CY51", "0780627822", "B0041QSZS8", "B00000JGHO", "B0000YEE6M", "B00005JD5J", "0783230524", "B000FS9ULC", "6305428409", "B004SIP93S", "B0001US5T2", "B00005O06V", "B00066FAVW", "0767811070", "B00005JLON", "B001K98MGE", "B00008977B", "B00007ELEO", "0767813901", "B00006HAYO", "0783240201", "630514415X", "0780627857", "B002GSXKOM", "B0000TWMTS", "B00005JL72", "B00007L4KF", "B00066FAC6", "B00005ASOO", "B000TLOMPE", "B0000JBUHI", "B00124ONGA", "B000HDZKLO", "B00ANDDBBY", "B00AMEZDJW", "6304821832", "B000063RQO", "B00AEBB9AA", "B003UEYBPI", "B000051YMS", "B0000714BU", "B000JRYOPG", "B002CA68MU", "B004P7CMZ0", "B001DJLD12", "B000060MWA", "B00003W8NT", "B00007AJG1", "B00008978S", "B00AEFYAC0", "B00005UQ9I", "B000BOH8X2", "B00005U156", "B00GTS8ECS", "B00005RIX5", "B00465I1CE", "B000XT1P52", "B00AEFY6TW", "B000069DOB", "B00GOZ2LPM", "B000P0J0CE", "B003NH6FY2", "B00AMSNEEY", "B00AEFXP8K", "0783237367", "B00005JD5H", "B001132GNY", "B0042AHOPI", "B003BV8I3Q", "B000LW7REE", "B000069I0E", "B0006H32DO", "B0009PW4F0", "B00007BK2Q", "B00021R7E4", "B00005OW06", "B000093I8L", "B002CA68NE", "B000P0J092", "B003L16FCC", "B00BEL4QFO", "0780631234", "B0008237BO", "B00007BK2S", "B000P0J0CY", "B001P3SA94", "B0002DRDIW"], "bought_together": ["B00AEFYE08", "B00005JLG1"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000BITV9W", "B00BTYPWDQ", "B00005JLG1", "B00AEFYE08"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 22984}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.56, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "0767821955", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51J7FF8G0RL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Poetic Justice"}

{"description": "Fantastical writer Gary Ross (Big,Dave) makes an  auspicious directorial debut with this inspired and oddly touching comedy about two '90s kids (Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon) thrust into the black-and-white TV world ofPleasantville, aLeave It to Beaver-style sitcom complete with picket fences, corner malt shop, and warm chocolate chip cookies. When a somewhat unusual remote control (provided by repairman Don Knotts) transports them from the jaded real world to G-rated TV land, Maguire and Witherspoon are forced to play along as Bud and Mary Sue, the obedient children of George and Betty Parker (William&nbsp;H. Macy and Joan Allen). Maguire, an obsessivePleasantvilledevotee, understands the need for not toppling the natural balance of things; Witherspoon, on the other hand, starts shaking the town up, most notably when she takes basketball stud Skip (Paul Walker) up to Lover's Lane for some modern-day fun and games. Soon enough, Pleasantville's teens are discovering sex along with--gasp!--rock & roll, free thinking, and soul-changing Technicolor. Filled with delightful and shrewd details about sitcom life (no toilets, no double beds, only two streets in the town),Pleasantvilleis a joy to watch, not only for its comedy but for the groundbreaking visual effects and astonishing production design as the town gradually transforms from crisp black and white to glorious color. Ross does tip his hand a bit about halfway through the film, obscuring the movie's basic message of the unpredictability of life with overloaded and obvious symbolism, as the black-and-white denizens of the town gang up on the \"coloreds\" and impose rules of conduct to keep their strait-laced town laced up. Still, the characterizations from the phenomenal cast--especially repressed housewife Allen and soda-shop owner Jeff Daniels, doing some of their best work ever--will keep you emotionally invested in the film's outcome, and waiting to see Pleasantville in all its final Technicolor glory.--Mark Englehart", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 436957}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.82, "brand": "", "asin": "0780627024", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51C118QWETL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Pleasantville [VHS]"}

{"description": "Before Hollywood had entirely typecast Alfred Hitchcock as the master of suspense, withMr. & Mrs. Smithhe was allowed to fashion an elegant romantic trifle starring Robert Montgomery and Carole Lombard. It probably won't replaceRear WindoworPsychoin your affections, but the film is more than a curious footnote to the director's career. The two leads play David and Ann Smith, a devoted but endlessly squabbling couple who discover their three-year marriage isn't legal. When he unexpectedly hesitates to arrange a second wedding, she storms out in a huff and soon begins dating his solid, dependable business partner Jeff (Gene Raymond). The rest follows the formula laid down by such previous screwball comedies asThe Awful Truth(1937) andBringing Up Baby(1938): David employs fair means or foul to win back Ann's heart, causes all sorts of complicated mischief, then... well, three guesses what happens in the end.The intriguing thing about the movie is how Hitchcock takes Norman Krasna's paper-thin script and adds sly undercurrents of menace. Violence seems about to erupt in the recurring scenes where Ann shaves her husband (suggestively holding a razor up to his throat)--and there's a touch ofVertigoin one scary moment when a jammed amusement park ride leaves two characters dangling helplessly high above the ground. Montgomery and Lombard keep the mood acceptably frivolous, while indicating the flawed nature of the marital relationship. From the evidence of this one-off, Hitchcock might have been among the best comedy directors in the business, had he so wished.--Peter Matthews", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 506512}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.5, "brand": "", "asin": "0780626699", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51WQC2AJP4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Mr &amp; Mrs Smith [VHS]"}

{"description": "Something's wrong in the town of Santa Mira, California. At first, Dr. Miles Bennell (Kevin McCarthy) is unconcerned when the townsfolk accuse their loved ones of acting like emotionless imposters. But soon the evidence is overwhelming--Santa Mira has been invaded by alien &quot;pods&quot; that are capable of replicating humans and taking possession of their identities. It's up to McCarthy to spread the word of warning, battling the alien invasion at the risk of his own life. Considered one of the best science fiction films of the 1950s and '60s, this classic paranoid thriller was widely interpreted as a criticism of the McCarthy era (that's Senator Joseph, not actor Kevin), which was characterized by anticommunist witch-hunts and fear of the dreaded blacklist. Some hailed it as an attack on the oppressive power of government as Big Brother. However viewers interpret it, this original 1956 version ofInvaders of the Body Snatchers(based on Jack Finney's serialized novelThe Body Snatchers) remains a milestone movie in its genre, directed by Don Siegel with an inventive intensity that continues to pack an entertaining wallop.

The story of a Long Island town whose summer tourist business is suddenly threatened by great-white-shark attacks on humans bypasses the potboiler trappings of Benchley's book and goes straight for the jugular with beautifully crafted, crowd-pleasing sequences of action and suspense supported by a trio of terrific performances by Roy Scheider (as the local sheriff), Richard Dreyfuss (as a shark specialist), and particularly Robert Shaw (as the old fisherman who offers to hunt the shark down).

{"description": "Steven Spielberg's 1993 mega-hit rivalsJawsas the most intense and frightening film he'd ever made prior toSchindler's List, but it was also among his weakest stories. Based on Michael Crichton's novel about an island amusement park populated by cloned dinosaurs, the film works best as a thrill ride with none of the interesting human dynamics of Spielberg'sJaws. That lapse proves unfortunate, but there's no shortage of raw terror as a rampaging T-rex and nasty raptors try to make fast food out of the cast. The effects are still astonishing (despite the fact that the computer-generated technology has since been improved upon) and at times primeval, such as the sight of a herd of whatever-they-are scampering through a valley.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00004U8P4", "B00003CXXR", "6303314015", "6301792734", "6304143184", "0783216084", "0767825411", "6304089767", "6303506291", "B00005JKDQ", "6300214060", "6301208773", "6301888901", "6302091632", "6304233639", "6302054982", "0788805533", "B00000JGEI", "6301666569", "6302453356", "6305319138", "B0000AQZYM", "6302787068", "6301744136", "B000059XXZ", "B000059XY5", "B000005QWI", "0784011923", "6304500831", "6303020089", "B000003KSM", "6302968143", "6302415853", "6300214435", "B00000490M", "6301744160", "630157401X", "6302877881", "6304007523", "6300181987", "6301661729", "6304030959", "0800198395", "0783226152", "B000062XM6", "B00005B238", "6303212263", "630596260X", "B000005PPB", "B0000048S1", "6303824382", "B000007OY0", "B000005PFL", "6300248089", "B00004RFFA", "6300213005", "6305045976", "080010367X", "6304022166", "B00006G8LB", "0790700506", "0790719029", "B00005B6ND", "0790742322", "6304196954"], "bought_together": ["B00004U8P4", "B00003CXXR"], "also_viewed": ["B00004U8P4", "B00003CXXR", "6304143184", "6301792734", "6305750750", "6304089767", "6303506291", "B0087ZG7NO", "B00005LL26", "6300214753", "6304539258", "0788806270", "0784011923", "B00005JLGL", "B0057R5XRG", "B000065U6Q", "6304400551", "0767825411", "0788805533", "6304500831", "B0002XNSYA", "6302787068", "B00000K2SC", "0780607287", "155890641X", "6304539274", "6302091632", "B00000JS61", "B0000AQZYM", "0792839129", "B00004U8KV", "B00005JKDQ", "6303313345", "0788812807", "6302526574", "6300213803", "630018403X", "6302426200", "B00005MP5C", "B000035Z2S", "080010367X", "B00023NRSM", "6301543408", "0790705141", "6304015127", "B00004R99N", "6303212379", "0783216084", "6302320402", "6304718551", "B0087ZG7J8", "B00000JGEI", "6303953425", "B005N64U52", "6303929567", "6303314015", "6302453356"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 481629}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.68, "brand": "", "asin": "0783222734", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51MNFQR1V1L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]"}
{"description": "After building up the duo's popularity through popular recordings and several performances onSaturday Night Live,John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd--as \"legendary\" Chicago blues brothers Jake and Elwood Blues--took their act to the big screen in this action-packed hit from 1980. As Jake and Elwood struggle to reunite their old band and save the Chicago orphanage where they were raised, they wreak enough good-natured havoc to attract the entire Cook County police force. The result is a big-budget stunt-fest on a scale rarely attempted before or since, including extended car chases that result in the wanton destruction of shopping malls and more police cars than you can count. Along the way there's plenty of music to punctuate the action, including performances by Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin, Cab Calloway, and James Brown that are guaranteed to knock you out. As played with deadpan wit by Belushi and Aykroyd, the Blues Brothers are \"on a mission from God,\" and that gives them a kind of reckless glee that keeps the movie from losing its comedic appeal. Otherwise this might have been just a bloated marathon of mayhem that quickly wears out its welcome (which is how some critics described this film and its 1998 sequel). Keep an eye out for Steven Spielberg as the city clerk who stamps some crucial paperwork near the end of the film.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783227078", "6300182150", "B000005PFL", "0800198395", "6302877881", "6301569385", "6300989003", "630220366X", "6305576173", "B000006N70", "6304071876", "6301300394", "B00005Q4GY", "6301971809", "630281622X", "0800132009", "B0000068ZQ", "6305363668", "B00005RRG6", "6301697294", "6304196954", "0783202253", "6300181987", "6301208773", "6302032377", "0800116917", "6304107250", "6303168507", "0766202771", "0783235607", "6300246965", "B000077VT7", "6302909023", "630150528X", "6304155972", "B000005QWI", "B000007PI9", "630470786X", "6300214567", "6303057225", "0792839846", "B00000JGEK"], "bought_together": ["0783227078"], "also_viewed": ["6300182150", "B000005PFL", "B00000JKNP", "B00003CXCQ", "B00G5G7EXY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 240790}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.98, "brand": "", "asin": "0783225199", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41BZ5ANGQ2L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Blues Brothers [VHS]"}
{"description": "Carl Reiner made this enjoyable romantic farce about a divorced couple who commence an affair at their daughter's wedding. Reiner lets the idea bounce around the story's setting and characters so that the full comic effect of the illicit relationship can be felt more chaotically, building on its own irony. Bette Midler and Dennis Farina are quite believable and likable as the not-so-estranged-anymore couple, and Paula Marshall is very good as their exasperated daughter. Not a masterpiece, but one of Reiner's best films in years, with a distinctively European flavor to the comedy.

{"description": "Derivative fluff from 1987, made tolerable by its bawdy exuberance and an appealing performance by Michael J. Fox, who was still enjoying TV stardom and the career momentum he earned by travelingBack to the Future. Here he plays a Kansas farm boy who dreams of scoring big in New York City, but reality turns out to be brutal to his ambition. When his uncle (Richard Jordan) gives him a mail-room job in the high-rise headquarters of a major corporation, Fox occupies an empty office and poses as a young executive, winning the attention of a lovely young colleague (Helen Slater) and having an affair with his boss's wife (Margaret Whitton). Sporadically amusing as a yuppie comedy and rather off-putting as a wannabe sex farce, the movie's still recommendable for its lively cast and a breezy style that almost succeeds in updating the conventions of vintage screwball comedy. Whitton is a standout performer here, so you may wonder why her comedic talent has been underrated, apart from a good role in the first twoMajor Leaguemovies. This may be little more than a big-screen sitcom, but it's not without its charms.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305133468", "B00009AOBH", "B0007IO6NM", "0783230354", "B0012RWQJ8", "B00013WWT8", "B000065V3H", "B0000A14TA", "B00AEBB9DW", "6305213283", "B000065U1Q", "B00015YVD6", "6305428050", "B0001IN0S0", "B00005R5G9", "B005QX8UEE", "B002O3Z4YI", "B00D2UMHVK", "6305236569", "B000063UR3", "B0015RRN9S", "B001ECDVK4", "B00441GYQ0", "B00005T7I0", "B000F6ZIIS", "0783230060", "B001AEF6C2", "B000E6ESI0", "B000FO0A9W", "B00AEBB99Q", "0783226896", "B002XUBDRY", "B000FO0AA6", "B001Q8MMD8", "B00009PY3X", "B000068TPB", "6305428395", "B0043X1FLI", "B00AEFYW64", "B00ALTQRRK", "B001ECDVJU", "B00AEBB9E6", "B000035Z5H", "B000068MC0", "0792844866", "0783225504", "B000Y11B7Q", "B00009AOBM", "B00081U7HC", "B0002B15X8", "B0000A98ZO", "B00009AOBK", "B00AEBB8YW", "B00E1HIXFW", "B000F6ZIII", "B000059TGG", "B0000542C9", "B000065V3L", "B0001GOH84", "B0045HCJRG", "B00DJYKD0G", "B002GHHHP6", "B0001EFTSS", "B00AG475K8", "B0000648ZQ", "B00AEFXX9Q", "B00005U5A8", "B00020HB4Q", "B0053TWVR8", "B005FQ2H8W", "B00005V5NS", "B00441GYZG", "B000065V3E", "B000CEV3M8", "B003IQ5YZE", "078322740X", "B0038Z5T4Q", "B000PMFRYC", "B00008G8M4", "B002GHHHNI", "B001LXIDVI", "B0006GANOQ", "B0001GOH7U", "B001Q8MMCE", "B000N60H9U", "B001LXIDW2", "B00AEFXXMI", "B0015NORDW", "B00005N5SB", "B0043X1FOU", "B005OK0YVG", "B0045HCIYU", "6304711891", "B00070FX5U", "B00K31RBYY", "B00803PFXG", "B00AEBB9WI", "B000SFOW8I", "B00AEFXYJA", "B00026ZG10"], "bought_together": ["6305133468"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000N60H9U", "6305133468", "B00319ECII", "6305236569"]}, "price": 6.66, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 11839}, "asin": "0783229364", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515B421EWKL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Secret of My Success"}

{"description": "Alfred Hitchcock considered this 1943 thriller to be his personal favorite among his own films, and although it's not as popular as some of Hitchcock's later work, it's certainly worthy of the master's admiration. Scripted by playwright Thornton Wilder and inspired by the actual case of a 1920's serial killer known as \"The Merry Widow Murderer,\" the movie sets a tone of menace and fear by introducing a psychotic killer into the small-town comforts of Santa Rosa, California. That's where young Charlie (Teresa Wright) lives with her parents and two younger siblings, and where murder is little more than a topic of morbid conversation for their mystery-buff neighbor (Hume Cronyn). Charlie was named after her favorite uncle, who has just arrived for an extended visit, and at first Uncle Charlie (Joseph Cotten) gets along famously with his admiring niece. But the film's chilling prologue has already revealed Uncle Charlie's true identity as the notorious Merry Widow Murderer, and the suspense grows almost unbearable when young Charlie's trust gives way to gradual dread and suspicion. Through narrow escapes and a climactic scene aboard a speeding train, this witty thriller strips away the fa&ccedil;ade of small-town tranquility to reveal evil where it's least expected. And, of course, it's all done in pure Hitchcockian style.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300183580", "6304039530", "1558807780", "6301670140", "0783221347", "0783235593", "6301798503", "0783235623", "6304039506", "6301975987", "630197350X", "6304429274", "6304359705", "6304457316", "6304119046", "6300183513", "6301798732", "6300215644", "6302909023", "B0000040EO", "630150528X", "0783222955", "6305123616", "0783217390", "0783235607", "6302278929", "6301797957", "6301798260", "B003MG6FJY", "0783235674", "6300158438", "6300215741", "6301564456", "0783235704", "6301327845", "6301586042", "6301800974", "B000003KE0", "0790733897", "6303020089", "0782008348", "6301977149", "6301969316", "6300183912", "6303364772", "6303957013", "1558804226", "6301973410", "B00004TX24", "6300988791", "630266232X", "6301973259", "6301670159", "0800100832", "0790743213", "6301640667", "6301969049", "B00004TYS8", "630196912X", "6302878535", "6302120101", "6300269264", "B00007JME0", "6302299497", "6302360978", "6300181421", "630160086X", "6302484421", "6302413435", "6300181340", "6302779782", "6302305942", "B0002IXSVI", "6301586026", "B00003OSTO", "0783235615", "6301964012", "079284517X", "0792837096", "B00000FZXC", "6302226899", "0783235682", "6300208133", "6301972171", "6302884705", "6302503493", "6302801133", "6303039693", "6304308418", "630196571X", "6301967682", "1558808590", "6303560067", "6305012792", "6300181723", "B000GX7MMA", "6303333079", "6301955625", "6301977815"], "bought_together": ["6300183580", "6301670140"], "also_viewed": ["6300183580", "6301670140"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 168467}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.5, "brand": "", "asin": "0783236352", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51K145Q7XJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Shadow of a Doubt [VHS]"}
{"description": "Alexandre Dumas's classic tale of fraternal squabbling makes a more than satisfactory transition to celluloid with this 1976 made-for-television swashbuckler. Viewers familiar with the more recent Leonardo DiCaprio version may be stymied at first by the non-MTV pace and the rather unhip presence of Richard Chamberlain in the lead role(s). This well-lensed actioner overcomes a somewhat pokey first half to emerge as a terrific adventure, complete with plenty of derring-do, some sharply pointed dialogue, and a wonderful performance by the incomparably malevolent Patrick McGoohan. Rousing fun for burgeoning rapscallions of all ages. Director Mike Newell would later find success in a different genre withFour Weddings and a Funeral. Ian Holm, Louis Jordan, and Ralph Richardson round out the embarrassingly rich supporting cast.--Andrew Wright", "related": {"also_bought": ["0784001294", "B000U34PM6", "B003BJODK0", "B00004RERO", "B0000A2ZNX", "B00E3QJ8DC", "B000060MVD", "0784001847", "B000XJD34I", "0784001308", "B0007PALM0", "B00008CMT3", "B0050MB3I6", "0784001316", "6301628454", "B00000G08Q", "6301977815", "6302682584", "6301976622", "630236308X", "6301977181", "6301670140", "630170875X"], "bought_together": ["0784001294", "0784001308"], "also_viewed": ["B000U34PM6", "B00E8G5HVE", "B0068Y4NBY", "B00006ADFM", "B003BJODK0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 130450}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 20.99, "brand": "", "asin": "0784001804", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51EY0HS37SL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Man in The Iron Mask: Literary Masterpieces [VHS]"}

{"description": "Robin Williams won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor, and actors Matt Damon and Ben Affleck nabbed one for Best Original Screenplay, but the feel-good hitGood Will Huntingtriumphs because of its gifted director, Gus Van Sant. The unconventional director (My Own Private Idaho,Drugstore Cowboy) saves a script marred by vanity and clunky character development by yanking soulful, touching performances out of his entire cast (amazingly, even one by Williams that's relatively schtick-free). Van Sant pulls off the equivalent of what George Cukor accomplished for women's melodrama in the '30s and '40s: He's crafted an intelligent, unabashedly emotional male weepie about men trying to find inner-wisdom.Matt Damon stars as Will Hunting, a closet math genius who ignores his gift in favor of nightly boozing and fighting with South Boston buddies (co-writer Ben Affleck among them). While working as a university janitor, he solves an impossible calculus problem scribbled on a hallway blackboard and reluctantly becomes the prodigy of an arrogant MIT professor (Stellan Skarsg&#229;rd). Damon only avoids prison by agreeing to see psychiatrists, all of whom he mocks or psychologically destroys until he meets his match in the professor's former childhood friend, played by Williams. Both doctor and patient are haunted by the past, and as mutual respect develops, the healing process begins. The film's beauty lies not with grand climaxes, but with small, quiet moments.

{"description": "One of the funniest films in many a moon was hiding at art house  theaters in 1998. FormerSaturday Night Livecomedian and Spinal Tap member Christopher Guest creates the ultimate parody of small-town dramatics,Waiting for Guffman. Corky St. Claire (Guest), an overwhelming drama director hiding out in Blaine, Missouri, thinks he has found the vehicle to put him back on Broadway:  the city's 150th anniversary play,Red, White, and Blaine.As rehearsals start, we learn of the town's history (\"the stool capital of the world\") including a brush with a UFO. The mockumentary follows the various townsfolk wishing for stardom: Parker Posey as a Dairy Queen clerk, Catherine O'Hara and Fred Willard as stage-struck travel agents, Matthew Keeslar as the town's bad boy, and Eugene Levy (who cowrote the film with Guest) as a dentist who dreams of glory on the stage. The film is a hoot from beginning to end, and be sure to watch the closing credits. Fans of Guest's deft dry humor should not miss his other parody of the entertainment world,The Big Picture(Kevin Bacon as a student filmmaker who goes to Hollywood).--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005ALS0", "B0000ALFVD", "B000M341Q4", "B00005NKC9", "6305922756", "B0007UC8Y4", "B0000ALFVE"], "bought_together": ["B00005ALS0", "B0000ALFVD"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 288595}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.45, "brand": "", "asin": "079073155X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51MCNQ0AY9L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Waiting for Guffman [VHS]"}
{"description": "Twisterwas a mega-million-dollar blockbuster--helmed by a director (Dutchman Jan de Bont) hot off another scorcher hit (Speed)--that flaunted state-of-the-art digital effects and featured a popular leading actress (Helen Hunt) who would win an Academy Award for her next film (As Good As It Gets). But ask anybody who's seen it and they'll tell you who the real star ofTwisteris: the cow. Not to give anything away, but the cow is one of those inspired little touches (like, say, Bronson Pinchot's career-making cameo inBeverly Hills Cop) that adds a touch of personality to a gigantic Hollywood production. The story is blown out the window after an impressive prologue in which Hunt's character, as a little girl, witnesses her daddy being sucked into a tornado. Basically, Hunt and Bill Paxton are thrill-seeking meteorologists chasing twisters in order to study them (and help warn people of them, of course) with a new technology they've developed. If you thought the Kansas tornado inThe Wizard of Ozwas every bit as scary as the Wicked Witch of the West, then this may be the movie for you.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783225547", "B00E8G5HQE", "B00008G8M4", "B0002V7OI8", "B00000G3PA", "B00005JMXX", "B000P0J0C4", "B0006GANOQ", "B002GIBVVG", "B00AEFXPSK", "6304806434", "B001OFM2TC", "B0045HCJFS", "B0057RCFQS", "0783225733", "B00AEFXT1S", "B000N4RAS8", "B000P0J09W", "6304711891", "B00004Z4WR", "B007STBUHI", "B007SPPANM", "B00E8G5HZ0", "B001OQCV2E", "B0013BM63O", "B00AEFXPMG", "B000QUCRB4", "6305236569", "B000EHSVPK", "B002GHHHKQ", "B000EGDB10", "B00026ZG10", "B000QUU4LY", "B00AEFY4CG", "0800195175", "B001LXIDW2", "0790732149", "1558908315", "B00177YA1K", "B0007PLLBU", "B00003CXFV", "B00081U7HC", "6305212112", "1603800875", "B000JYW5BE", "B0068FZ0O2", "0783235070", "B00003CXTG", "B000FO0AA6", "B000ETRA5U", "B00005JN5E", "B001LXIDVS", "B006VRRGNK", "B0068FZ0GK", "B0013FDM7E", "B00003CXSM", "B00004XPPG", "B000CEV3M8", "6304765266", "B001LXIDVI", "B000QUCQX8", "B000QQLVPQ", "B00393SG1U", "0790730979", "B00AEFXE9U", "B00AEFXXMI", "B000EHSVNW", "0767803434", "B004AOECXI", "B000GRUMPU", "B001ECDVK4", "630471193X", "B00008WFU4", "B005QW98NM", "B000P0J0EW", "B00AEBB8NS", "B000SFOW8I", "B00AEFYW64", "B002NZK5V4", "B00AEFY6PQ", "B00008G6E8", "B0045HCJT4", "0783223609", "B00000IQC4", "B00005ATZT", "B00008WFU5", "B00008K76U", "B00AEFY5TI", "B0006FYOTC", "B007IUEE0C", "B00AEFY0F2", "B0002CHK1S", "0783225504", "B001CRC4DG", "B00407PO3W", "B002XUBDRY", "B0000844I8", "0800177258", "B00005JNTI"], "bought_together": ["B00008G8M4", "B00000G3PA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00634MLO0", "B00008G8M4", "B005LAIIPS", "0783225733"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 91188}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 13.95, "brand": "", "asin": "0790729636", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GW5RZP9SL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Twister"}

{"description": "A favorite film of some of the world's greatest filmmakers, including Martin Scorsese and Steven Spielberg, John Ford'sThe Searchershas earned its place in the legacy of great American films for a variety of reasons. Perhaps most notably, it's the definitive role for John Wayne as an icon of the classic Western--the hero (or antihero) who must stand alone according to the unwritten code of the West. The story takes place in Texas in 1868; Wayne plays Ethan Edwards, a Confederate veteran who visits his brother and sister-in-law at their ranch and is horrified when they are killed by marauding Comanches. Ethan's search for a surviving niece (played by young Natalie Wood) becomes an all-consuming obsession. With the help of a family friend (Jeffrey Hunter) who is himself part Cherokee, Ethan hits the trail on a five-year quest for revenge. At the peak of his masterful talent, director Ford crafts this classic tale as an embittered examination of racism and blind hatred, provoking Wayne to give one of the best performances of his career. As with many of Ford's classic Westerns,The Searchersmust contend with revisionism in its stereotypical treatment of \"savage\" Native Americans, and the film's visual beauty (the final shot is one of the great images in all of Western culture) is compromised by some uneven performances and stilted dialogue. Still, this is undeniably one of the greatest Westerns ever made.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300268470", "630197705X", "0792106989", "6301325508", "0782008348", "6303057225", "6300181588", "6300268799", "0792102320", "6301797922", "6301802330", "6303192254", "0792838556", "6301805518", "6304071876", "6301798759", "6300184951", "6300269884", "6300267830", "1555265952", "6300181715", "0792107128", "6303599052", "6300208281", "0783221347", "B00004RFFA", "6304457308", "6304457278", "079284517X", "6301977165", "6300268748", "B000051S3Z", "B001E419N8", "B000M7BEPQ", "B000GX4476", "0792110188", "6301628454", "6300988473", "0800132009", "B000059HGY", "6301805615", "B00004WZR1", "6301670159", "0792107683", "630310374X", "0783235607", "6303942830", "6302884438", "6305237115", "630150528X", "0792834879", "0790743213", "0783235593", "6304259131", "6301798503", "630018224X", "6302130379", "B000006N70", "6304935811"], "also_viewed": ["6303599052", "6303168507", "6300269884", "6301802330", "0792106989"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 293111}, "asin": "0790736918", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51G79RSPRAL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Searchers [VHS]"}
{"description": "Winner of the Academy Award&reg; for best picture of 1989, this gracefully moving drama, adapted from the hit play by Alfred Uhry, chronicles the 25-year friendship between a stubborn, aging Southern widow (Jessica Tandy) and her loyal chauffeur (Morgan Freeman). At first, the self-sufficient Miss Daisy is reluctant to accept the services of a chauffeur, but Hoke is quiet, wise, and tolerant, and as the years pass the unlikely friends develop a deep mutual respect and admiration. Tandy deservedly won the Oscar for her sassy and sensitive performance, and Freeman earned an Oscar nomination for bringing quiet depth and integrity to his memorable role. Ironically, director Bruce Beresford (Tender Mercies) was not nominated, but the film won Oscars for makeup and for Uhry's screenplay, in addition to a supporting actor nomination for Dan Aykroyd as Daisy's supportive son. Delicate, funny, and bittersweet,Driving Miss Daisywas a surprise hit when released, and marked the crowning achievement of Tandy's great career.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305212112", "B0000JBALO", "B00004TJKK", "076780676X", "B00005NRN8", "B003ASLJK4", "B00AEBB9FA", "0783240171", "B00AEFY0F2", "B000P0J092", "B00001W9G0", "B004A8ZWVK", "B006FE83UE", "B000765IJK", "B004SIP7F8", "B001VC99HQ", "B00DDT0JB0", "B00AEFXYOA", "B000TXP56C", "B004SEUJOQ", "B000YAF4MA", "B004FQX5A2", "B001ECDVJU", "0767836359", "B003LMPKSQ", "B00AEFXD1O", "B002M2Z3BA", "B004AOECXI", "B00AEFY4CG", "6305128952", "0800141806", "B00004XPPC", "B00005MEOU", "B002NZK5RS", "B0045HCJ76", "B00006G8GZ", "B008B9JTFO", "B000JYW5B4", "B001ECDVK4", "6305236569", "6305428352", "B00AFEYJ80", "B000XJD34I", "6305133468", "B001NLJ3NU", "B00AEFYK5M", "B002VWNICM", "B00AATV07S", "B00020HAV0", "B007SPPANM", "B00020HAWE", "B000PHVZNE", "B002VECM6S", "B000065FJC", "B002VWNIAY", "B00011D1OU", "B00006RCO2", "B004SIP6C2", "B0010AN7Z4", "B000E6ESI0", "B0045HCJJY", "B0000YTP02", "6305213283", "B000EHRVOW", "6304907729", "B00K6D1QV8", "B00404ME1A", "B000JU8H9C", "B00EV4EUT8", "B000059HAN", "B00005AUKE", "B0009S4IKQ", "B005HWAOP2", "B007N31YH0", "B00AEFY9GW", "B000QQLVPQ", "B000KJTGHO", "B00AEBBACM", "630471193X", "B000244GCW", "B002HK9IDQ", "B000YDBPAM"], "bought_together": ["6305212112", "B0000JBALO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0000JBALO", "6305212112", "B00DDT0JB0", "B003ASLJK4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 77014}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 18.95, "brand": "", "asin": "0790730987", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4161YA15GNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Driving Miss Daisy"}
{"description": "The first thing you need to know aboutSleepersis that it's based on a novel by Lorenzo Carcaterra that was allegedly based on a true story. The movie repeats this bogus claim, which was attacked and determined by a wide majority to be misleading. Knowing this,Sleeperscan be a problematic movie because it's too neat, too clean, too manipulative in terms of legal justice and dramatic impact to be truly convincing. And yet, with its stellar cast directed by Barry Levinson, the movie succeeds as gripping entertainment, and its tale of complex morality--despite a dubious emphasis on homophobic revenge--is sufficiently provocative. It's about four boys in New York's Hell's Kitchen district who are sent to reform school, where they must endure routine sexual assaults by the sadistic guards. Years after their release, the opportunity for revenge proves irresistible for two of the young men, who must then rely on the other pair of friends (Brad Pitt, Jason Patric), a loyal priest (Robert De Niro), and a shabby lawyer (Dustin Hoffman) to defend them in court. Despite the compelling ambiguities of the story, there's never any doubt about how we're supposed to feel, and the screenplay glosses over the story's most difficult moral dilemmas. And yet,Sleepersgrabs your attention and pulls you into its intense story of friendship and the price of loyalty under extreme conditions.

{"description": "Director Joe Pytka apparently has little to say about the making ofSpace Jam; he leaves most of the commentary to voice actors Billy West and D.&nbsp;Bradley Baker (who took over some of Mel Blanc's voices) in this enhanced edition of the film. The commentators spend most of their time complimenting the actors (\"He's a great guy\") and the film itself (\"Rich, beautiful colors\"). Although he made them sound spontaneous, Mel Blanc never ad-libbed: Talented writers crafted his lines. West and Baker aren't exactly raconteurs, and the result is like watching the movie while two guys in the next row talk about it and do so-so impressions of Bugs and Daffy. Also includes three music videos and an alternate music-only audio track.--Charles Solomon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00006SFL7", "B00E1HIX66", "B000089778", "B0000633U2", "B00028HBES", "B00KLXVKQO", "B008WCP2OC", "B0006J28MI", "B0001906W2", "B0041H55RQ", "B007Q2GR9I", "B00BTYSIWI", "B000002JBG", "0783219806", "B000XKW2WG", "B006GF40O0", "B000065V42", "6305428387", "B007TGOJLE", "B00005JD5H", "B0000VCZKW", "B000089771", "B00005JG6M", "B002YMWQ2M", "B00E4Q6U9Q", "B000P0J09W", "B000068QPY", "B007NQK0WC", "B005F96UJ6", "B002GHHHNS", "B000P0J0A6", "B00008979O", "B004GJYRF0", "B0002UQAM0", "B000065V43", "B006QO58W4", "B000YC9FW8", "B0036APHRC", "B00460PQM2", "B003P4PWTM", "B000TB8MAA", "B001V5C7IG", "B004D3CFV2", "B00658MX1A", "B0000DZTNB", "B0013XZ76K", "B00081912E", "B000031EGV", "B000063US5", "B003L20IF6", "B0007V0XQI", "B000056T4I", "B0019GEY2Y", "B00AEFXPG2", "B0007LLPXI", "B000065DJY", "B00004R99S", "B000HI5WTY", "B001AGXEAG", "B000N5T8KA", "B000068QPM", "B002BS4834", "B000QQLVPQ", "B000JGEF3I", "1558908404", "B009F3YJPA", "B002WN8INY", "B004P5O8E0", "B00009YXAW", "B000AMSBP4", "B001L62MJO", "B004FPJ00M", "B00005S8J2", "B009RTGBIA", "B0060ZJ7BC", "B00004R99F", "B0002E56EY", "B000OF3IQE", "B001EKYWX6", "B004DMIISM", "B000ENSRQC", "B00AJSJCAW", "B000P0J088", "B00007AJGH", "B000QGNY6A", "B0079XLAW8", "B003F3NDVW", "B000Z8W7I0", "B00AEFXJY0", "B00AEFXOKO", "B007STKSIA", "B000K8MV86", "B0007US7C6"], "bought_together": ["B00028HBES"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00028HBES", "0783219806", "B004GJYRF0", "B000006FQS"]}, "price": 30.0, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 96261}, "asin": "0790749858", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51VYNK2S0PL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Space Jam"}

Neo finds himself targeted by the police when he is contacted by Morpheus, a legendary computer hacker branded a terrorist by the government. Morpheus awakens Neo to the real world, a ravaged wasteland where most of humanity have been captured by a race of machines that live off of the humans' body heat and electrochemical energy and who imprison their minds within an artificial reality known as the Matrix. As a rebel against the machines, Neo must return to the Matrix and confront the agents: super-powerful computer programs devoted to snuffing out Neo and the entire human rebellion.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JLTM", "B0001DI5W6", "0784011923", "B001FB55HQ", "0792845684", "B001DZFYPW", "0790731975", "6300271331", "B00003CXE6", "0792839846", "0792133153", "6303257844", "6303313345", "6300182304", "6303168507", "B00000JGEK", "6304071876", "6300215830", "6301963725", "0800199421", "6303398480", "6305363668", "6303202004", "079213690X", "6304258984", "B0000509BZ", "6304434170", "630018627X", "6301976622", "0783222955", "6302610702", "6302787564", "0800132009", "0767825411", "6303020089", "6301574117", "6302909023", "B000003KHS"], "bought_together": ["B00005JLTM", "B0001DI5W6"], "also_viewed": ["B001DJLD1M", "B0054509I4", "B001CEE1YE", "B00005JKCH", "6303148352", "B000AYELVA", "B001GZ6QEC", "B001JNNDBA", "B0000AXE8I", "B0001DI5W6", "6303215734", "B00005JLTM", "B0007WFX62", "6304143184", "B00005N5S5", "B001AQT0Z4", "B001FB55HQ", "B0013FBS20", "B0001BKAEY", "B000PC6A3E", "B00007ELF1", "B00005JMQW", "B0000633U4", "1880521008", "B004XKVPG6", "B00ANGID14", "B001RIY4WE", "B008M4MB8K", "B00AEFY5B6", "B00B4804KS", "B00E5I2MCM", "B005LAIHY0", "B0013FSL3E", "B00471JSRE", "B0057R5XRG", "B00E9PMMX0", "B00C3MKCF6", "B00BEZTMFY", "B00AQNOCZ0", "B00IWULSTC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 579943}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.97, "brand": "", "asin": "0790745399", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51208Z0A3HL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Matrix"}
{"description": "Legendary silent film director Cecil B. DeMille didn't much alter the way he made movies after sound came in, and this 1956 biblical drama is proof of that. While graced with such 1950s niceties as VistaVision and Technicolor,The Ten Commandments(DeMille had already filmed an earlier version in 1923) has an anachronistic, impassioned style that finds lead actors Charlton Heston and Yul Brynner expressively posing while hundreds of extras writhe either in the presence of God's power or from orgiastic heat. DeMille, as always, plays both sides of the fence as far as sin goes, surrounding Heston's Moses with worshipful music and heavenly special effects while also making the sexy action around the cult of the Golden Calf look like fun.

{"description": "David Lynch peeks behind the picket fences of small-town America to reveal a corrupt shadow world of malevolence, sadism, and madness. From the opening shots Lynch turns the Technicolor picture postcard images of middle class homes and tree-lined lanes into a dreamy vision on the edge of nightmare. After his father collapses in a preternaturally eerie sequence, college boy Kyle MacLachlan returns home and stumbles across a severed human ear in a vacant lot. With the help of sweetly innocent high school girl (Laura Dern), he turns junior detective and uncovers a frightening yet darkly compelling world of voyeurism and sex. Drawn deeper into the brutal world of drug dealer and blackmailer Frank, played with raving mania by an obscenity-shouting Dennis Hopper in a career-reviving performance, he loses his innocence and his moral bearings when confronted with pure, unexplainable evil. Isabella Rossellini is terrifyingly desperate as Hopper's sexual slave who becomes MacLachlan's illicit lover, and Dean Stockwell purrs through his role as Hopper's oh-so-suave buddy. Lynch strips his surreally mundane sets to a ghostly austerity, which composer Angelo Badalamenti encourages with the smooth, spooky strains of a lush score.Blue Velvetis a disturbing film that delves into the darkest reaches of psycho-sexual brutality and simply isn't for everyone. But for a viewer who wants to see the cinematic world rocked off its foundations, David Lynch delivers a nightmarish masterpiece.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["6304510861", "6303018351", "0790705141", "6300182770", "6302185882", "6303515304", "6300147630", "6304346158", "6300214044", "6302226899", "B000067DGJ", "B00004T37H", "0792839846", "630026999X", "0792846303", "6303422969", "0783229585"], "also_viewed": ["6302185882", "6300182770"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 325598}, "asin": "0792838084", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71W22ZVC1XL._SY300_.gif", "title": "Blue Velvet [VHS]"}

{"description": "Eliot Asinof's detailed bookEight Men Outillustrates how the system of American sports collapsed in 1919, the year the Chicago White Sox threw the World Series. Filmmaker John Sayles worked on his script years before the 1988&nbsp;film (or before he had the rights to make the film) as a labor of love. Sayles's adaptation proves one can make a historically accurate film in the day and age of artistic license. And what a story. Although many know about the \"Black Sox,\" made famous--again--in the 1989 hit filmField of Dreams, the details of the saga are far less known. The center ofDreams, Shoeless Joe Jackson (portrayed correctly by D.B.&nbsp;Sweeney as illiterate and left-handed inEight), is not the core of this film; it's ace pitcher Eddie Cicotte (Sayles favorite David Strathairn), who took the money, and third baseman Buck Weaver (John Cusack), who did not. The film fits nicely into Sayles's (Lone Star) strong suit: the ensemble drama. We are introduced to bickering owners, famous crooks, high-minded judges, lowlife gangsters, investigative reporters (played by Studs Terkel and Sayles himself), and, most of all, players who are at the breaking point when it comes to low salaries and degrading rewards. While some may feel the film is not as visceral as it should be, there is a great amount of verisimilitude when watching finely tuned athletes telling their bodies to play poorly--heartbreak on the nation's diamond. Beautifully detailed (like Sayles's previous labor-drama,Matewan),Eight Men Outgives us powerful lessons in which everyone lost: players, gamblers, and especially the fans who love the game.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005M20M", "6302534372", "0767809262"], "bought_together": ["B00005M20M"], "also_viewed": ["B000003KMM", "B0000399WO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 448268}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.67, "brand": "", "asin": "0792841786", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GD6FM6ZVL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Eight Men Out [VHS]"}
{"description": "Rain Manis the kind of touching drama that Oscars are made for--and, sure enough, the film took Academy honors for best picture, director, screenplay, and actor (Dustin Hoffman) in 1988. Hoffman plays Raymond, an autistic savant whose late father has left him $3 million in a trust. This gets the attention of his materialistic younger brother, a hot-shot LA car dealer named Charlie (Tom Cruise) who wasn't even aware of Raymond's existence until he read his estranged father's will. Charlie picks up Raymond and takes him on a cross-country journey that becomes a voyage of discovery for Charlie, and, perhaps, for Raymond, too.Rain Manwill either captivate you or irritate you (Raymond's sputtering of repetitious phrases is enough to drive anyone crazy), but it is obviously a labor of love for those involved. Hoffman had been attached to the film for many years, as various directors and writers came and went, but his persistence eventually paid off--kind of like Raymond in Las Vegas. Look for director Barry Levinson in a cameo as a psychiatrist near the end of the film.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000FVQLQQ", "B00AEFY0F2", "B004SIP7ZS", "B000066HAS", "0800141741", "B004FQX5B6", "B0043X1FL8", "0767811100", "B0018QPPXW", "B000P0J0EW", "B000065V3G", "B00AEFXYJA", "B000ZM1MG4", "B0002WZTOI", "B001680M26", "B00005B6JZ", "B002VWNIBI", "0800141806", "B000P0J0EM", "B00079Z9VO", "B00AEFYSWM", "B00AEFY4CG", "B007SPPANM", "B00005MEOU", "0792833287", "B00081U7HC", "6305144168", "B006TTC5HC", "B00AEFXR1K", "B0000DIXDR", "B00AEBB9LO", "B004U7MR1Y", "B00AEFYRP0", "B00AEBB9F0", "B00AEBB9FA", "B000QQLVPQ", "B00003CWQR", "B00006RCO1", "B000LP6KNU", "0783226810", "B004AOECXI", "B00AEFZ63M", "B000PHVZNE", "B007N31YH0", "B000GAKDAG", "B0000JBALO", "B002NZK5UU", "B00000IQV7", "B00011CZRE", "B000CNESTE", "B000035Z5G", "B00004WG2F", "B00008EY60", "B000ZM1MGE", "0780619587", "0784011710", "B00AEBB99Q", "B000G6BLHY", "079284646X", "B00008K76U", "0767836359", "B00AEFXXMI", "B0068FZ0GK", "B00026ZG10", "B00AEFXKUI", "0767803434", "B00005M2CO", "6305236569", "0783225733", "B00AEBB9UK", "0792833198", "B001AEF6BI", "B000HEWEJO", "B002M2Z3BA", "B001KRCDSO", "B00006RCO3", "B00AEFXESQ", "B00B0U2SFE", "B00AEBB9SM", "B000067IZ3", "B0006GANOQ", "6304712936", "B00001ZWUS", "B000VECAD0", "B000KX0IOA", "6304907729", "B000055Y0Y", "B0002B15ZG", "6304711891", "6305213305", "630471193X", "B00AEFYXJ0", "B00007BKVC", "B00AEBB95K", "B00003CWRX", "B0008ENHUI", "B000765IJK", "B00004TVUD", "B004FQX5A2", "B00005ATZT"], "bought_together": ["B00AEFY0F2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004SIP7ZS", "B00AEFY0F2", "B0094V8OXG", "0783226845"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 40583}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.99, "brand": "", "asin": "0792833260", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514MRDGQE7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Rain Man"}

{"description": "Through the idyllic but war-ridden jungles of Vietnam strides Chuck Norris as Braddock, one-man army, killing the enemy in droves with every gun burst, hauling wounded buddies to safety draped across his shoulders like sacks of wheat. He doesn't wear a helmet because clearly his head is not a particularly vulnerable area. As he leaps upon a vicious Vietcong who's brutally bayoneting a buddy of Braddock's, he plucks the rings from two hand grenades--and wakes from a recurring nightmare. Haunted by his memories, Braddock joins a delegation sent to Vietnam to negotiate for the return of missing-in-action prisoners of war (hence the movie's title,Missing in Action). But when the communist government accuses Braddock of war crimes, he fights back! It's all pretty preposterous--particularly the subtler absurdities, like when Braddock dresses entirely in stealthy ninjalike black except for his head, allowing his feathered blond locks to fly free--but fans of this kind of jingoistic action flick will find it satisfying enough. The fight scenes are frequent, if not particularly imaginative. Also featuring the great character actor M.

{"description": "Most fans of everything-but-the-kitchen-sink comedies likeThe Naked GunandHot Shotsprobably think the genre started withAirplane!, but Neil Simon'sThe Cheap Detectivecame two years earlier. It's a camp parody of Humphrey Bogart's 1940s detective flicks (particularlyThe Maltese FalconandThe Big Sleep), with a big dose ofCasablancathrown in for good measure. There's no point in describing the plot--it's little more than a series of cameos by just about every actor working in the 1970s, including Ann-Margaret, Eileen Brennan, Stockard Channing, James Coco, Scatman Crothers, Dom DeLuise, John Houseman, Marsha Mason, and Nicol Williamson. Peter Falk plays the detective and does a fine Bogey impression. Unfortunately, it's not Neil Simon's best work--he's better at character comedy such asThe Odd CoupleandThe Goodbye Girlthan this kind of slapstick--but there are a few good lines and the cast gives it their best. Louise Fletcher, not usually known for comedy, does a sharp satire of Ingrid Bergman inCasablanca, and Madeline Kahn never fails to entertain in a variety of disguises.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302797535"], "bought_together": ["6302797535"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 90495}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.95, "brand": "", "asin": "0800101057", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Z5EV1Y7PL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Cheap Detective [VHS]"}

{"description": "Regardless of whether it was \"too early\" in 2006 to dramatize the events of September 11th, 2001, \"World Trade Center\" succeeds as a tribute to the courage and sacrifice of those who served at \"ground zero\" in the wake of terrorist attacks on the WTC's twin towers in New York City. Removed from the politics of war and terrorism (yet still, like all films, inherently political in expressing its point of view), Oliver Stone's potent drama focuses on the nightmarish ordeal, and subsequent rescue, of Port Authority policemen John McLoughlin (Nicolas Cage) and Will Jimeno (Michael Pe?a), who were buried deeply within the rubble of the WTC after the twin towers collapsed. Granted, it's only the film's historical context that distinguishes it from any other dramatic rescue story, but in focusing on the goodness of humanity in response to the evil of terrorists who remain unnamed and off-screen, Stone and first-time screenwriter Andrea Berloff create an emotional context as powerful as anything Stone has directed since \"Platoon\". Even as he resorts to some questionable tactics typically lacking in subtlety, Stone refrains from much of the blunt-force filmmaking that has made him a critical punching bag, rising to this challenging occasion with a heartfelt and deeply American portrait of unity ' personal, familial, and national.

He's attending his high school reunion on an assignment; he's got a rival hit man (Dan Aykroyd) on his tail; and he's going to have to explain to his old girlfriend (Minnie Driver) why he stood her up on prom night. This amiable black comedy, cowritten by Cusack and directed by Jonathan Demme prot&eacute;g&eacute; George Armitage (Miami Blues), has the feel of Demme'sSomething WildandMarried to the Mob--which is to say its humor is dark and brightly colored at the same time. Cusack and Driver are utterly charming--as is the leading man's sister, Joan, who plays his secretary. (Ms. Cusack received an Oscar nomination for her next role, inIn & Out.)

{"description": "If you're not a connoisseur of graphic horror and gruesome gore, you'd better steer clear of this wicked 1992 horror-comedy from the demented mind and delirious camera of New Zealand-born writer-director Peter Jackson. However, if nonstop mayhem and extreme violence are your idea of great entertainment, you're sure to appreciate Jackson's gleefully inventive approach to a story that can judiciously be described as sick, twisted, and totally outrageous. The movie's central character is a poor schmuck named Lionel who's practically enslaved to his domineering mother. But when ol' Mum gets bitten by a rare and poisonous rat monkey from Skull Island and is turned into a flesh-eating zombie, Lionel has the unfortunate task of keeping Mama happy while fending off all the other zombies that result from her voracious feeding frenzies. If you've read this far, you'll either be crying out for censorship or eagerly awaiting your first viewing (or second, or third...) of this wildly clever and audaciously uninhibited movie. And while director Jackson would later achieve critical success with his fact-based dramaHeavenly Creatures, his talent is readily evident in this earlier effort.

Yet, in a bold move, CBS produced the television miniseriesJesus, which not only retells the biblical story, but takes a look at the more human side of the man. Jeremy Sisto stars, and although it takes a little while for him to gather enough momentum to have us believing him in this role, overall he is surprisingly convincing. While the movie does stray from strict scripture--Jesus is shown feeling conflicted over his feelings for Lazarus's sister Mary; Satan, portrayed by Jeroen Krabb&eacute;, works hard at convincing Jesus to stray from his path--most of the plot will be familiar to viewers. Beginning with an adult Jesus, who works with his father as a carpenter, the program traces his life and death through resurrection. The strong supporting cast, including Jacqueline Bisset as Mary, Gary Oldman as Pontius Pilate, and Debra Messing as Mary Magdalene, lends to the credibility of the miniseries. This is a satisfying retelling of the life of Jesus and will please those who want new ways to explore biblical stories, asJesusnot only reinforces the ideals of the New Testament but shows Jesus as a complex individual.--Jenny Brown", "related": {"also_bought": ["1401931944"], "bought_together": ["1401931944"], "also_viewed": ["B002BBLXHU"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 357697}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 2.5, "brand": "", "asin": "1573629219", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41EAH1ZZMWL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Jesus [VHS]"}
{"description": "Forget about Kevin Costner's sun-kissed, water-colored, Oscar-winningDances with Wolves.Black Robe, which was directed by Bruce Beresford, a director who gave the world the finest film of the early '80s Australian new wave,Breaker Morant, and who continually collides cultures and ethnicity in his films (Mister Johnson,Driving Miss Daisy), matches and surpasses the Costner epic as an expertly crafted, brutal saga of redemption and salvation. In 1634 a young French Jesuit missionary is assigned to trek 1,500 miles through the New France wilderness to a mission settled in Huron Indian country.Black Robechronicles the journey of Father Laforgue (Lothaire Blutheau) as he leaves his Jesuit brothers and, with the aid of a young translator and guide, Daniel (Aden Young), and eight canoes of Algonquin Indians, moves into the uncompromising Canadian northern territory on a die-hard mission to convert the natives. Mixing elements of Michael Mann'sThe Last of the Mohicansand Roland Joff&eacute;'sThe Mission, Beresford offers a restless tale of Laforgue's conflicted faith juxtaposed against the sublime spiritual harmony with the land that the Huron and Algonquin already hold.Black Robedances to its own drummer and is tuned into the precarious balance between nature's mystery and spirit and the strident, unyielding religious ethic. The cinematography by Peter James is relentlessly cruel and bleak, but it absolutely conveys the obstacles that face the idealistic and blind young priest, who by the end, has faced his own awakening.

The plot ofRopeis simple and based on a successful stage play: two young men (John Dall and Farley Granger) commit murder, more or less as an intellectual exercise. They hide the body in their large apartment, then throw a dinner party. Will the body be discovered? Director Alfred Hitchcock, fascinated by the possibilities of the long-take style, decided to shoot this story as though it were happening in one long, uninterrupted shot. Since the camera can only hold one 10-minute reel at a time, Hitchcock had to be creative when it came time to change reels, disguising the switches as the camera passed behind someone's back or moved behind a lamp. In later years Hitchcock wrote off the approach as misguided, andRopemay not be one of Hitchcock's top movies, but it's still a nail-biter. They don't call him the Master of Suspense for nothing.

His apartment is a shrine to Humphrey Bogart, and it's none other than Bogey himself who materializes at strategic moments to counsel Allan on romantic strategy. He gets more corporeal aid from his married friends, Linda (Diane Keaton) and Dick (Tony Roberts), who try to orchestrate prospective matches and reassure him when those chemistry experiments explode. When Allan finds himself falling in love with Linda, the dissonance between fantasy and reality proves both funny and poignant--a precursor to the deeper emotionalism missing from the star's earlier directorial efforts that was soon to inform Allen's most affecting '70s comedies. It's also the start of his onscreen relationship with Keaton, further underscoring Allen's evolution toward a more satisfying contemplation of the friction between head and heart.--Sam Sutherland", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000BWMEIS", "6301972147", "6301963911", "B0000068DV", "6304196806", "6303011411", "6301971922", "B000NNOYH4", "6300183513", "6303686761", "6300150151", "B00005AUJL", "6301967658", "6302779480"], "bought_together": ["B000BWMEIS"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 341486}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 15.41, "brand": "", "asin": "6300216365", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51B8XDZQC1L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Play It Again, Sam [VHS]"}

But it was the outrageously farcicalRaising Arizonathat announced the Coens' darkly comedic audacity to the world. It wasn't widely seen when released in 1987, but its modest audience was vocally supportive, and this hyperactive comedy has since developed a large and loyal following. It's the story of \"Ed\" (for Edwina, played by Holly Hunter), a policewoman who falls in love with \"Hi\" (for H.I. McDonnough, played by Nicolas Cage) while she's taking his mug shots. She's infertile and he's a habitual robber of convenience stores, and their folksy marital bliss depends on settling down with a rug rat. Unable to conceive, they kidnap one of the newsworthy quintuplets born to an unpainted-furniture huckster named Nathan Arizona (Trey Wilson), who quickly hires a Harley-riding mercenary (Randall \"Tex\" Cobb) to track the baby's whereabouts. What follows is a full-throttle comedy that defies description, fueled by the Coens' lyrical redneck dialogue, the manic camerawork of future director Barry Sonnenfeld, and some of the most inventively comedic chase scenes ever filmed. Some will dismiss the comedy for being recklessly over-the-top; others will love it for its clever mix of slapstick action, surreal fantasy, and homespun family values. One thing's for sure--this is a Coen movie from start to finish, and that makes it undeniably unique.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0790750414", "6303953425", "6301797957"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 206770}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 0.94, "brand": "", "asin": "6300249964", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71621XK1MRL._SY300_.gif", "title": "Raising Arizona [VHS]"}

This Sherlock Holmes pastiche with a twist stars Kingsley as physician, writer, and self-effacing super-sleuth Dr. John Watson, who channels his genius for deduction into lucrative stories about Holmes. Watson wants the world to believe the fictional private eye actually exists, posing a problem when a steady stream of troubled souls come seeking Holmes's help. The doctor's prescription: hire a two-bit, drunken, skirt-chasing actor (Caine) to portray the Great Detective, an arrangement that causes Watson consternation whenever \"Holmes\" tries to improvise his way through a case.

No  surprise here: like father, like son. Daphne Zuniga is his sweet young  girlfriend, and John Getz reprises his role from the first film as a bitter  alcoholic with a very bad fake beard. This cut-rate \"Son of the Fly\" knockoff  pales next to Cronenberg's classic, degenerating into a gory revenge flick.  Walas strains under a limited budget, and many of the more elaborate creatures  (a monstrously mutated dog, the skeletal fly monster leaping about the  warehouse-like lab) are rather shabby. The makeup is suitably gooey, slathered  in ooze and pus, and the mayhem-filled finale is a nasty but impressive  over-the-top frenzy of blood and gore climaxing in the nastiest piece of poetic  justice sinceFreaks.

{"description": "Assault on Precinct 13, the second feature by John Carpenter (Halloween,Vampires), has a group of cops and convicts joining forces as they're besieged in an all-but-abandoned police station by Street Thunder, a gang armed with automatic weapons and silencers.  The relationships of those holed up in the police station as they try to survive the onslaught form the better part of the movie, borrowing liberally from the films of Howard Hawks, especiallyRio Bravo, to make the point about who's \"good enough\" and who isn't.  The action is taut and shocking for its time (1976).  Street Thunder is more an irrational force, an embodiment  of pure evil, than a clearly motivated group with a political agenda, drawing comparisons withAssault's other main influence, the zombies in George&nbsp;A. Romero'sNight of the Living Dead.  More than an action-exploitation flick (though it more than holds its own on that level),Assault on Precinct 13is a disguised Western with a horror aspect that Carpenter would later work out more rigorously in such films asHalloweenandThe Thing.

{"description": "Hollywood's golden year of 1939 found the Marx BrothersAt the Circus, up to their usual mischief if not their usual standards. It's a lesser effort but still a rollicking good time, casting Groucho, Chico, and Harpo as the would-be saviors of a financially troubled circus. Of course, Groucho gets the lion's share of zingers as crackpot lawyer J. Cheever Loophole (especially when sparring with his quintessential straight-lady, Margaret Dumont), and Irving Brecher's zippy dialogue (with a last-minute polish by Ben Hecht) is custom fit to the Marxes' vaudeville roots. This was the Marxes' third movie for MGM, and the studio's insistence on sappy romantic subplots and a wimpy romantic lead (Kenny Baker) occasionally stalls the manic momentum. Fortunately there's ample compensation, including Groucho's signature performance of \"Lydia, the Tattooed Lady,\" penned byWizard of Ozsongwriters Harold Arlen and Yip Harburg.

{"description": "Fredric March won an Oscar&#xAE; for playing the protagonist (and antagonist) of Robert Louis Stevenson's story.  Dr. Henry Jekyll is an honorable man of science, albeit frustrated at the enforced celibacy of a delayed wedding date. Hyde is the fearsome creature he turns into after drinking a potion, and Hyde's appetites (mostly expressed with Miriam Hopkins's Cockney dance-hall wench) are decidedly unrestrained. March's performance is pretty theatrical, but it's fun to watch; his Hyde twitches and squawks and lopes around like an ape in a tuxedo. Rouben Mamoulian's direction has plenty of the brio of early-thirties Hollywood, and the transformations from Jekyll to Hyde are ingenious for the time.

Along the way, endless traffic jams, sudden violence, and vistas of gory car crashes underscore their corrupted values. Their lethal encounter with the in-laws and kidnap by an anarchic band of radical cannibals finds the couple--and presumably \"decent\" society with them--reverting to a nasty primitivism.

{"description": "Director Barry Sonnenfeld (Men in Black) brings his distinctly cartoonish sensibility to this feature film version of the old Charles Addams comic strip. Anjelica Huston was born to play Morticia Addams, matriarch of the ghoulish Addams clan, while the late Raul Julia is a very agreeable, lusty Gomez. But it's Christina Ricci who arguably steals the show as their stone-faced daughter, Wednesday. As is often the problem with adaptations of comics or television shows, somehow an original story has to be implemented that doesn't clutter things up. But clutter is an issue here as the script gets tangled on a lame plot concerning efforts to steal the Addams' house and fortune. Still, it's fun to see an ideal cast reanimate an old favorite.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303057942", "0790742322", "0790736969", "6303506291", "B00000F8J1", "6303122647", "6300214753", "6302968143", "0790700506", "6304416415", "6302091632", "B00003CXI0", "B00005LL26", "B00003CXXI", "6303212379", "6302481805", "B000005PFL", "B0000AKCKK", "6303494080"], "bought_together": ["0790742322", "0790700506"], "also_viewed": ["6303057942", "B00AJCUL2G", "0790742322", "B000641D2Y"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 329238}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.88, "brand": "", "asin": "6302409365", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DZGADFDNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Addams Family [VHS]"}

{"description": "Universal's first werewolf film falls in the shadow of the 1941 hitThe Wolf Man. You might say it's a different animal, as this version carries none of the now-familiar trappings of the wolf-man legend: no wolfsbane, no silver bullets, no gypsy curse. Dr. Wilfrid Glendon (Henry Hull) is a London botanist whose search for a rare flower takes him to a \"cursed\" valley in Tibet where he's mauled in the moonlight by a wolflike creature. Back in London he meets the mysterious Dr. Yogami (a marvelously melancholy performance by Warner Oland), who explains they met once before \"in Tibet... in the dark\" before asking for a flower from his botanical find, the only antidote for his curse. Glendon scoffs at his stories of werewolves--until he transforms into a hirsute killer under the effect of the full moon. Although leaner and edgier than the famous 1941 Lon Chaney classic,The Werewolf of Londonstumbles with the corny Scotland Yard investigation of the murder spree and gets sidetracked in the bizarre bickering of two old drunken cronies. But it takes flight in wonderfully imaginative and eerie scenes and striking action sequences, while a Jekyll-and-Hyde dynamic turns a jealous squabble between Glendon and his young wife Lisa (Valerie Hobson) into the tragic twist of the curse: \"The werewolf instinctively kills the thing it loves best.\"--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300183084", "630252542X", "6300181278", "630252587X", "6302843227", "6302843219", "6302526175", "6300185443", "6301005783", "6302120101", "6302841771", "6302841844", "6302526140", "6302526086", "6302526051", "6302526167", "6302526191", "6300181286", "6300181820", "6303626475", "6302841763", "6301257014", "6300183092", "6300185869", "6300185281", "6302526094", "630284178X", "6302841798", "6303129153", "6303129161", "6303506259", "6300183629", "6303129013", "630018529X", "6302491975", "6302843200"], "also_viewed": ["6302841771", "6302843200", "6300185281", "B0001CNRNE"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 325304}, "asin": "6302526159", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51KGC44JSBL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Werewolf of London [VHS]"}
{"description": "City Lightsis a film to pick for the time capsule, a film that best represents the many aspects of director-writer-star Charlie Chaplin at the peak of his powers: Chaplin the actor, the sentimentalist, the knockabout clown, the ballet dancer, the athlete, the lover, the tragedian, the fool. It's all contained in Chaplin's simple story of a tramp who falls in love with a blind flower girl (Virginia Cherrill). Chaplin elevates the Victorian contrivances of the plot to something glorious with his inventive use of pantomime and his sure grasp of how the Tramp relates to the audience. In 1931, it was a gamble for Chaplin to stick with silence after talking pictures had killed off the art form that had made him famous, but audiences flocked toCity Lightsanyway. (Chaplin would not make his first full talking picture until 1940'sThe Great Dictator.) After all the superb comic sequences, the film culminates with one of the most moving scenes in the history of cinema, a luminous and heartbreaking fade-out that lifts the picture onto another plane. (Woody Allen paid homage to the scene at the end ofManhattan.)

{"description": "With this powerful 1992 drama, director-producer George Miller (The Road  Warrior) proved that a movie  about a disease doesn't have to be a typical disease-of-the-week movie. Based on  the real-life case of the Odones family, the story concerns 5-year-old Lorenzo, suffering mightily from an  apparently incurable and degenerative brain illness called A.L.D. His parents,  an economist (Nick Nolte) and a linguist (Susan Sarandon), refuse to accept the received wisdom that there is no hope, and set about learning  biochemistry to pursue a cure on their own. The film becomes an intriguing  scientific mystery mixed with a story of pain, grief, and the strain on the two adults. In other words,Lorenzo's Oilis similar to all those  medical-mayhem TV flicks but with some key differences: a pair of great  actors in Sarandon and Nolte--who actually do some of the finest work of  their careers here--and Miller's bold and typically inventive direction.  Miller, a doctor himself, refuses to shirk from the chaos and horrors of a  child's agony, and he makes us hear the death chains rattling behind images that would be purely sentimental in another director's hands.--Tom  Keogh", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 315697}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.97, "brand": "", "asin": "6302779448", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5160FEN38FL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Lorenzo's Oil [VHS]"}

{"description": "Britain's Ealing Studios was at the top of its game when this classic comedy was released in 1951--one of the all-time best crime-caper comedies and a quintessential example of the witty and subtly subversive Ealing style. Alec Guinness stars as a mild-mannered transporter of gold bullion who has spent 20 years moving gold bars to banks in an armored truck. Then one day he simply decides to help himself to a million British pounds' worth of the gold, but to pull off the heist he enlists and old friend (Stanley Holloway), who sculpts and manufactures paperweights. Once the gold is hijacked, it's molded into souvenir miniatures of the Eiffel Tower and shipped off to Paris, right under the noses of British customs officials on alert for the missing gold. Panic ensues when six of the gold miniatures are mistakenly sold to a group of English schoolgirls, and just when the amateur thieves think they've finally pulled off their heist without a hitch ... well, let's just say this classic comedy has a few climactic tricks up its sleeve. Guinness is in peak form here, and director Charles Crichton (who scored a late-career hit withA Fish Called Wandaover a quarter-century later) keeps the action moving with impeccable British efficiency. Along withThe LadykillersandThe Man in the White Suit(both starring Guinness),The Lavender Hill Mobrepresents the golden age of British comedy, and it's still delightfully entertaining.--Jeff Shannon", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 458595}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.08, "brand": "", "asin": "6303209963", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51FB24FPW8L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Lavender Hill Mob [VHS]"}

Honor Blackman's Pussy Galore is the prototype for the series' rash of man-hating supermodels.

{"description": "There were only two ways for \"classicTrek\" cast members to appear in a movie with the cast ofStar Trek: The Next Generation: either Capt. Kirk and his contemporaries would have to be very, very old, or there would be some time travel involved in the plot. Since geriatric heroes aren't very exciting (despite a welcomed cameo appearance by the aged Dr. McCoy),Star Trek: Generationsunites Capt. Kirk (William Shatner) and Capt. Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) in a time-jumping race to stop a madman's quest for heavenly contentment. When a mysterious energy coil called the Nexus nearly destroys the newly christened U.S.S.Enterprise-B, the just-retired Capt. Kirk is lost and presumed dead. But he's actually been happily trapped in the timeless purgatory of the Nexus--an idyllic state of being described by the mystical Guinan (Whoopi Goldberg) as \"pure joy.\" Picard must convince Kirk to leave this artificial comfort zone and confront Dr. Soran (Malcolm McDowell), the madman who will threaten billions of lives to be reunited with the addictive pleasure of the Nexus. With subplots involving the android Data's unpredictable \"emotion chip\" and the spectacular crash-landing of the starshipEnterprise, this crossover movie not only satisfiedTrekfans, but it also gave them something they'd never had to confront before: the heroic and truly final death of a belovedStar Trekcharacter. Passing the torch to the Next Generation with dignity and entertaining adventure, the movie isn't going to please everyone with its somewhat hokey plot, but it still ranks as a worthy big-screen launch for Picard and his stalwart crew.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305587159", "6304415346", "B00008OSD3", "6303202004", "6300216802", "630273486X", "6301543408", "630021463X", "6300215830"], "bought_together": ["6305587159", "6304415346"], "also_viewed": ["6305587159", "6304415346", "B00008OSD3", "6300214400", "6301543408", "6300216802"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 333275}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 0.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6303909949", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516Y2CS1YML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Star Trek Generations [VHS]"}
{"description": "The King of Comedy, which flopped at the box office, is actually a gem waiting to be rediscovered. LikeA Face in the Crowd(a not-so-distant cousin to this film),Network, andThe Truman Show, its target is show business--specifically the burning desire to become famous or be near the famous, no matter what. Robert De Niro plays the emotionally unstable, horrendously untalented Rupert Pupkin, a wannabe Vegas-style comedian. His fantasies are egged on by Marsha, a talk-show groupie (brilliantly played by Sandra Bernhard) who hatches a devious, sure-to-backfire plan. Jerry Lewis is terrific in the straight role as the Johnny Carson-like talk-show host Jerry Langford. De Niro's performance as the obsessive Pupkin is among his finest (which is saying a lot) and he never tries to make the character likable in any way. Because there's no hero and no one to root for, and because at times the film insists we get a little too close and personal with Pupkin, some will be put off. Yet it's one of Scorsese's most original and fascinating films, giving viewers much to consider on the subject of celebrity. Its inevitable climax is clever and quietly horrific.--Christopher J.

{"description": "This haunting classic of the silent screen is familiar to every graduate of Film 101. Like Eisenstein'sBattleship Potemkin, Godard'sBreathless, and Welles'sCitizen Kane, Caligari helped define a cinematic school... and forever changed the way the world made movies. It's also great fun, even for modern audiences.The film begins with two men trading horror stories. One promises the other a terrifying true tale--the harrowing story of his fianc&eacute;e's narrow escape from death. Here's the story: an amoral asylum director wants to see if he can order somnambulist patient Cesare to commit murder. To this end, the nefarious doctor masquerades as a traveling showman and picks victims from the gawking carnival crowds. He sends his sleepwalker out to execute bloody deeds by night--crimes of which Cesare is barely aware. Soon, Cesare abducts the narrator's girl and is caught ... which is only the beginning of the surprises.Caligari's world became the textbook example of 1920s German Expressionist cinema--a cockeyed dreamscape, where black-clad actors feverishly chase each other across moody, barely-realistic sets. Think of films such asDark Cityor theNightmare Before ChristmasorSaturday Night Live's \"Sprockets\" sketches.

{"description": "One of the first Hollywood films to deal openly with white racism toward Japanese Americans during World War II, this drama directed by 1950s action maestro John Sturges (The Great Escape) stars Spencer Tracy as a one-armed stranger named MacReedy, who arrives in the tiny town of Black Rock on a hot day in 1945. Seeking a hotel room and the whereabouts of an ethnic Japanese farmer named Komoko, MacReedy runs smack into a wall of hostility that escalates into serious threats. In time it becomes apparent that Komoko has been murdered by a local, racist chieftain, Reno Smith (Robert Ryan), who also plans on dispensing with MacReedy. Tracy's hero is forced to fight his way past Smith's goons (among them Ernest Borgnine and Lee Marvin) and sundry allies (Anne Francis) to keep alive, setting the stage for memorable suspense crisply orchestrated by Sturges. Casting is the film's principal strength, however: Tracy, the indispensable icon of integrity, and Ryan, the indispensable noir image of spiritual blight, are as creatively unlikely a pairing as Sturges's shotgun marriage of Yul Brynner and Steve McQueen inThe Magnificent Seven.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301586034", "6302360978", "6300988473", "0792837339"], "bought_together": ["6301586034"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 233275}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 13.88, "brand": "", "asin": "6304111347", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5159TXTQMZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Bad Day at Black Rock [VHS]"}

That same president, late in the film, personally flies a jet fighter to deliver a payload of missiles against an attack by extraterrestrials.Independence Dayis the kind of movie so giddy with its own outrageousness that one doesn't even blink at such howlers in the plot. Directed by Roland Emmerich,Independence Dayis a pastiche of conventions from flying-saucer movies from the 1940s and 1950s, replete with icky monsters and bizarre coincidences that create convenient shortcuts in the story.

{"description": "Lovely to look at, this story reveals little more than the characters' nude bodies. Like couples whose only attraction is physical, this has little to offer once it leaves the bedroom. We never learn the interests or inner workings of the lovers in question. They become nothing more than attractive bodies, which makes this little more than a shallow exercise in sexuality. The story is based on the controversial, and supposedly autobiographical, bestseller by experimental French novelist Marguerite Duras. It tells the story of a young French schoolgirl who becomes sexually involved with a sophisticated, older Asian man. Set in Indochina in the late 1920s, this is stunningly photographed and artfully directed by Jean-Jacques Annaud.

{"description": "The swashbuckler genre bumped into science fiction in 1954 for one of Hollywood's great entertainments. The Jules Verne story of adventure under the sea was Walt Disney's magnificent debut into live-action films. A professor (Paul Lukas) seeks the truth about a legendary sea monster in the years just after the Civil War. When his ship is sunk, he, his aide (Peter Lorre), and a harpoon master (Kirk Douglas) survive to discover that the monster is actually a metal submarine run by Captain Nemo (James Mason). Along with the rollicking adventure, it's fun to see the future technology that Verne dreamed up in hisnovel, including diving equipment and sea farming. The film's physical prowess is anchored by the Nautilus, an impressive full-scale gothic submarine complete with red carpet and pipe organ. In the era of big sets,20,000&nbsp;Leaguesset a precedent for films shot on the water and deservedly won Oscars for art direction and special effects. Lost in the inventiveness of the film and great set pieces including a giant squid attack are two great performances.

{"description": "Most people didn't mind Gwyneth Paltrow's English accent in this charming, 1996 adaptation of  Jane Austen's novel (which also inspiredClueless). But even if it doesn't sound quite right to you, there are plenty of authentic and wonderful Brit thespians in this film by screenwriter-turned-director Douglas McGrath (co-author of Woody Allen'sBullets Over Broadway), including Juliet Stevenson  (Truly Madly Deeply), Alan Cumming  (Buddy), Phyllida Law (Much Ado About Nothing), Ewan McGregor (the Scots star ofTrainspotting), and Sophie Thompson, outstanding and finally heartbreaking as the chattering Miss Bates. Paltrow plays Austen's benign busybody, Emma Woodhouse--so busy trying to arrange the lives of others that she is sidestepping her own.

{"description": "Decades ago, documentary filmmaker Leon Gast attempted to complete a feature about the 1974 \"Rumble in the Jungle\" championship bout between boxers Muhammad Ali and George Foreman in Kinshasa, Zaire. Sundry complications, though, held up the project until its release in 1996. It was well worth the delay. From Gast's perspective of modern history, the six weeks Ali and Foreman were forced to spend waiting in Africa for their fight to take place now looks like an important moment in America's cultural understanding of African American roots. In a nutshell, Ali had been stripped of his heavyweight champion title because his opposition to the Vietnam War-era draft had landed him in prison. Reigning champ Foreman agreed to a Don King-promoted match in Kinshasa, but after all parties got there the fight was put off. Gast captures the charismatic Ali, in the ensuing days and weeks, going out among the people and getting to know them while the more reclusive Foreman keeps to his own company. Meanwhile, King brings over black American artists such as James Brown and the Spinners to mix it up with African musicians. The sense of excitement and connection is thrilling, as is the boxing footage of Foreman and Ali finally taking swings at one another in a titanic duel. Writers George Plimpton and Norman Mailer, each of whom was covering the fight as journalists, are on hand to recollect the details. Whether you're a fight fan or not, this is a unique experience and a fascinating insight into America's sense of identity.--Tom Keogh", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 447868}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.79, "brand": "", "asin": "6304488297", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51W9FAZGTEL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "When We Were Kings [VHS]"}

{"description": "Plot is a meaningless term when trying to describeLost Highway. Here, more or less, is what happens:  A noise-jazz saxophonist (Bill Pullman) suspects his wife (Patricia Arquette) of infidelity. Meanwhile, someone is breaking into their house and videotaping them while they sleep. The wife is murdered and Pullman is convicted of the crime. Then, in prison, he transmogrifies into a young mechanic (Balthazar Getty) who is subsequently released, since, after all, he's not the guy they convicted. Getty goes back to his life and meets a local gangster's moll, who happens to be played by Patricia Arquette... but none of this has much to do with what the movie is really about. Dreams are what intrigues director David Lynch. Not friendly, happy dreams; his dreams whisper that what we think is real is just something we made up, something to keep ourselves from falling into chaos. Characters are fragments. Events happen not because they make sense, but because deep down wewantthese things to happen. Of course, in Lynch's dreams, as in our waking lives, getting what we want is not always pleasant. In the movie's best moments, you really have no idea what you're seeing. The screen is a big rectangle of color and shadow, but what it represents, well, it could be anything. And yet, in those moments, you've been given just enough hints of place, character, and story that these elusive images elicit a genuine dread, a sense that you might not want to see this, yet you can't look away; a sense that we are living on borrowed time, that something is fiercely askew in our psyches. As a whole,Lost Highwayis a failure: much of it is padded, gratuitous, and indulgent and pointless cameos bog down an already sluggish narrative.

{"description": "At his best, director John Woo turns action movies into ballets of blood and bullets grounded in character drama.Face/Offmarks Woo's first American film to reach the pitched level of his best Hong Kong work (Hard-Boiled). He takes a patently absurd premise--hero and villain exchange identities by literally swapping faces in science-fiction plastic surgery--and creates a double-barreled revenge film driven by the split psyches of its newly redefined characters. FBI agent Sean Archer (John Travolta) must play the villain to move through the underworld while psychotic terrorist Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage) becomes a perversely paternal family man while using every tool at his disposal to destroy his nemesis. Travolta vamps Cage's tics and flamboyant excess with the grace of a dancer after his transformation from cop to criminal, while Cage plays the sullen, bottled-up agent excruciatingly trapped behind the face of the man who killed his son. His attempts to live up to the terrorist's reputation become cathartic explosions of violence that both thrill and terrify him. This is merely icing on the cake for action fans, the dramatic backbone for some of the most visceral action thrills ever. Woo fills the screen with one show-stopping set piece after another, bringing a poetic grace to the action freakout with sweeping camerawork and sophisticated editing. This marriage of melodrama and mayhem ups the ante from cops-and-robbers clich&eacute;s to a conflict of near-mythic levels.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792116887", "0792133153", "0800125762", "B00006IUNT", "6304259131", "6304681496", "B00004WIDB", "079212569X", "6302816629", "6304258984", "B00005PJ8I", "B00003CXTF", "B000007OY0"], "bought_together": ["0792116887"], "also_viewed": ["6304259158"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 280197}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.39, "brand": "Paramount", "asin": "6304618344", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71PMMMZ3CYL._SY300_.gif", "title": "Face/Off [VHS]"}

First-time director Peter Cattaneo is a name to watch for; he easily conveys the sheer humanity of these people in their small town with their sad stories and irresistible sense of optimism.--Rochelle O'Gorman", "related": {"also_bought": ["0790734079"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 279626}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.97, "brand": "", "asin": "6304813759", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/513H8H3732L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Full Monty [VHS]"}
{"description": "\"Sir, there's a large formation of planes coming in from the north, 140 miles, 3 degrees east.\" \"Yeah? Don't worry about it.\" This is just one of the many mishaps chronicled inTora! Tora! Tora!The epic film shows the bombing of Pearl Harbor from both sides in the historic first American-Japanese coproduction: American director Richard Fleischer oversaw the complicated production (the Japanese sequences were directed by Toshio Masuda and Kinji Fukasaku, after Akira Kurosawa withdrew from the film), wrestling a sprawling story with dozens of characters into a manageable, fairly easy-to-follow film. The first half maps out the collapse of diplomacy between the nations and the military blunders that left naval and air forces sitting ducks for the impending attack, while the second half is an amazing re-creation of the devastating battle. WhileTora! Tora! Tora!lacks the strong central characters that anchor the best war movies, the real star of the film is the climactic 30-minute battle, a massive feat of cinematic engineering that expertly conveys the surprise, the chaos, and the immense destruction of the only attack by a foreign power on American soil since the Revolutionary War. The special effects won a well-deserved Oscar, but the film was shut out of every other category by, ironically, the other epic war picture of the year,Patton.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300181472", "6304935811", "6303057225", "6301971809", "B00003CXTF", "0800132009", "0800116917", "0783221347", "B00005Q4GY", "B001E419N8", "B000056BRF", "6303599052", "6304071876", "6300268799", "630150528X", "6301977289", "6302610702", "6302510031", "6304368801", "6302990076", "6300181154", "6303168507", "630018224X", "6300267970", "6300267938", "6302380588", "6303651488", "B00004TYS8", "0790752395", "6300268748", "6304143184", "6302482712", "630233683X"], "bought_together": ["6300181472"], "also_viewed": ["155890641X"]}, "price": 15.18, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 667783}, "asin": "6304935870", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21BQH7FVJHL.jpg", "title": "Tora Tora Tora (Widescreen Series) [VHS]"}
{"description": "Vittorio De Sica's remarkable 1947 drama of desperation and survival in Italy's devastating post-war depression earned a special Oscar for its affecting power. Shot in the streets and alleys of Rome, De Sica uses the real-life environment of contemporary life to frame his moving drama of a desperate father whose new job delivering cinema posters is threatened when a street thief steals his bicycle. Too poor to buy another, he and his son take to the streets in an impossible search for his bike. Cast with nonactors and filled with the real street life of Rome, this landmark film helped define the Italian neorealist approach with its mix of real life details, poetic imagery, and warm sentimentality. De Sica uses the wandering pair to witness the lives of everyday folks, but ultimately he paints a quiet, poignant portrait of father and son, played by nonprofessionals Lamberto Maggiorani and Enzo Staiola, whose understated performances carry the heart of the film. De Sica and scenarist Cesare Zavattini also collaborated onShoeshine,Miracle in Milan, andUmberto D, all classics in the neorealist vein, but none of which approach the simple poetry and quiet power achieved inThe Bicycle Thief.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["1572524448"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 492162}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 19.86, "brand": "", "asin": "6304963173", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/712GEZEYA3L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Bicycle Thief [VHS]"}
{"description": "After the tight plotting and quirky intensity ofFargo, this casually amusing follow-up from the prolifically inventive Coen (Ethan and Joel) brothers seems like a bit of a lark, and the result was a box-office disappointment. The good news is,The Big Lebowskiis every bit a Coen movie, and its lazy plot is part of its laidback charm. After all, how many movies can claim as their hero a pot-bellied, pot-smoking loser named Jeff \"The Dude\" Lebowski (Jeff Bridges) who spends most of his time bowling and getting stoned? And where else could you find a hairnetted Latino bowler named Jesus (John Turturro) who sports dazzling purple footgear, or an erotic artist (Julianne Moore) whose creativity consists of covering her naked body in paint, flying through the air in a leather harness, and splatting herself against a giant canvas? Who else but the Coens would think of showing you a camera view from inside the holes of a bowling ball, or an elaborate Busby Berkely-styled musical dream sequence involving a Viking goddess and giant bowling pins? The plot--which finds Lebowski involved in a kidnapping scheme after he's mistaken for a rich guy with the same name--is almost beside the point. What counts here is a steady cascade of hilarious dialogue, great work from Coen regulars John Goodman and Steve Buscemi, and the kind of cinematic ingenuity that puts the Coens in a class all their own. Be sure to watch with snacks in hand, becauseThe Big Lebowskimight give you a giddy case of the munchies.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783228317", "0792845684", "B000056V73", "B000059HCI", "B0002G2B2W", "6305123616", "0792839846", "6304078145", "6302610702", "6304340648", "6301666569", "6302516986", "0790705141", "6303953425", "6300214753", "6305499365", "B00005ATQA", "630268644X", "6301578805", "6301627768", "6300184064", "0790734079", "6303454089", "6302941318", "6302054982", "1558807381"], "also_viewed": ["B0002G2B2W", "0783228317", "6304297912"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 212775}, "asin": "6304994540", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51WB1EBQW6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Big Lebowski [VHS]"}

{"description": "During the 10 years betweenNight of the Living DeadandDawn of the Dead, director George Romero had a string of box-office flops--some of which were actually quite good. For example,there'sThe Crazies, in which a military plane carrying biological-warfare agents crashes near Evans City, Pennsylvania. The virus gets into the town's water supply and has two effects on the infected: death or irreversible insanity. The military moves in to contain the situation, but the local populace regards the army as a menacing force and things rapidly spin out of control. Soon the highly contagious virus infects the whole town and the soldiers as well, while a government scientist races to find an antidote.The Craziesfeatures some great set pieces as the virus spreads: a little old lady smiles sweetly and stabs a soldier to death with a knitting needle; a young woman placidly sweeps with a broom while soldiers and locals have a bloody firefight around her; a soldier swings his rifle wildly at his comrades until they shoot him.Made in the shadow of both Vietnam and Watergate,The Craziescontains plenty of allegory: an invasion by military force, government cover-up and duplicity, madness and eventually genocide (all set, of course, in Romero's beloved Pennsylvania). The President only appears on television, and then only the back of his head is shown as he speaks in detached, almost bored tones. LikeNight of the Living Dead, this film offers no hope, no comfort, and sure as hell no happy ending. Keep an eye out for Romero in a somewhat gassy role as Evans City's mayor.--Jerry Renshaw", "price": 7.89, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 622083}, "asin": "6304983786", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51NA3QCSZFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Crazies [VHS]"}
{"description": "Making this movie represented a rather risky venture for Mel Gibson--it was his first effort at directing, and the role demanded that he deliberately obscure his sexy matinee-idol looks. Gibson seems to truly relish his Lon Chaney Jr.-esque turn as Justin McLeod, a reclusive former teacher with half his face and body badly scarred, and a dark, secret past. The folks in McLeod's postcard-pretty Maine town have dubbed him \"Hamburger Head\" and exchange malicious gossip about him. But one boy is needy enough to dare to penetrate the fortress McLeod has built against the outside world. Fatherless Chuck Norstadt (Nick Stahl) is so anxious to escape his dysfunctional family that he pesters McLeod into becoming his mentor. Their relationship for the most part avoids the sort of sticky sentimentality one might expect from Hollywood. Chuck is a real, credible kid, a petulant pain with a chip on his shoulder, and McLeod is no Mr. Chips. It's fun, and quite moving, to watch these two cranky misfits battle their way toward a friendship that will change both their lives. Margaret Whitton (Major League) gives an unaffected performance as Chuck's narcissistic mother. \"I'm just not cut out for this mothering racket,\" she tells her rudderless children, as she flits from man to man. Gibson's own personal code of honor, we suspect, is very much in evidence in this movie's message: One must take responsibility for what one wants in life.--Laura Mirsky", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 450110}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6305012814", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5128XQKSB4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Man Without A Face [VHS]"}
{"description": "Matineeoffers one of the best matches of director and screenplay that you're ever likely to find. Raised on a steady diet of 1950s monster movies, Joe Dante later contributed to the genre with such films asGremlinsandExplorers, but it was Charlie Haas's script forMatineethat gave Dante a perfect platform for comedy, dramatic context, and nostalgic homage. Set in Florida during the Cuban missile crisis of 1962, the movie focuses on a schlock-movie promoter named Woolsey (inspired by real-life producer William Castle and played to perfection by John Goodman) who arrives in Key West with his latest Grade-Z extravaganza,Mant, about the raving half-man/half-ant product of \"science run amuck.\" (This movie-within-a-movie is a perfect tribute by Dante, who cast B-movie stalwarts in the kind of roles they'd built careers on.)Balancing youthful exuberance with the ominous threat of nuclear attack, Dante finds his alter ego in Simon Fenton, who plays a 15-year-old captivated by Woolsey's cheesy showmanship. This affectionate devotion is matched by Dante, who captures the anxiety of the missile crisis even asMatineedelivers an abundance of humor. Director John Sayles and Dante-movie veteran Dick Miller have cameos as Woolsey's show-biz accomplices, and Cathy Moriarty is brilliant as Woolsey's wisecracking mistress and Z-movie queen. All of this makesMatineea polished gem that's sweetly entertaining while staying true to the serious context of its story. It's the movie Joe Dante was born to direct.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000WN0SM", "B00K6D1R0I", "B00KUS5YGC", "B00441GYQ0", "B00E1HIWXU", "B00K6D1S7A", "B00KB614HQ", "B0000648ZQ", "B00000K3U3", "B00FUABK36", "B008LFYXDG", "B00GPPXNLC", "B00IO998U2", "B0000694WH", "B00005K3OV", "B000FWHW8Q", "B00L326LTI", "B00I099JZK", "B00DTECHWS", "B00ISSF7S6", "B00I3C1T1Q", "B000K7VHTQ", "B003THSXKU", "B0045HCJRG", "B00HRJVHKE", "B00KDU8HQQ", "B000FVQLKM", "B00GBT61YS", "1613778457", "B00008973H", "B001B9ZVVC", "B00K6J7FGC", "3901644520", "B00005LC4D", "B00BTYSIWI", "B000FFJZO2", "B00009PY45", "B0045HCJKS", "B000RXVNDI", "B00FUABHVQ", "078321958X", "B00AEFXPG2", "B00000IQC4", "B00I462XNO", "B00K6J7Q6G", "0792846060", "B00FM4S5O2", "B000FVQLKW", "B00CDEJRDC", "B000035Z38", "B0088EDONK", "B00I3C1T6G", "0991127900", "B00D9EJFZA", "B001NKWLBW", "B00BXRVQO8", "B0009X770E", "B001Q8MMCE", "B000CCW2UW", "B005STRKC4", "B00JJOY41E", "B000063UR3", "6305428514", "B002I41KNC", "B004Z1HY36", "B00IELX0C2"], "bought_together": ["B0000WN0SM"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AMDA2O4", "B0000WN0SM", "B00009AOAX", "B000067FP8"]}, "price": 37.9, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 347038}, "asin": "6305080453", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61M2PDWCASL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Matinee"}

The empty speeches, lies, money, and pressure have led him to plan his own assassination on a weekend trip home to California just before the election. However, a cord snaps in him and like Jim Carrey's rambling lawyer inLiar, Liar, Bulworth can only tell the truth. This new freedom turns Bulworth on and he spews the ugly truth about politics: he tells mass media they are as corrupt as insurance companies; lambastes a black church for not having leaders; and riles the Jewish power elite of Hollywood. He enters South Central running away from advisors (including a bemused Oliver Platt) and mixing it up with a potential new girlfriend (Halle Berry) and a local boss (Don Cheadle). He offends across  the board, even developing an inherent knack to rap his speeches. And the public loves it. The weekend becomes a clarifying point for Bulworth: he finds a reason to live.Beatty's rude and relevant comedy is a one-joke movie, but the joke is pretty good. It's a courageous film that is always sharp even though it loses narrative focus. Beatty's hilarious raps are so inspired they deserve repeated viewings. As usual, Beatty surrounds himself with a great crew, Ennio Morricone's music and Vittorio Storaro's cinematography being especially noteworthy. Beatty and Storaro even have the audacity to imitate two very famous photographs in the film's final seconds. The script by Beatty and Jeremy Pikser won the L.A.

{"description": "It looks like writer-director Rick Famuyiwa started a popular trend with his marriage-jitters comedy about three friends who reminisce about their lives together as one prepares to leave the group when he gets married. Everyone who rushed to seeThe Best Manshould catch this sleeper which also stars Taye Diggs (as Roland, the reluctant groom), as well as Omar Epps and Richard T. Jones, who together provide charming, cheerful performances full of warmth and humor. This buddy story is told through flashbacks to 1986, when the three met at public school. The young men gain our affection in their competition to win the most girls, which enhances the bond of loyalty we see in them as men on the eve of Roland's wedding. The casting of the boy actors is almost spooky in its perfection, especially Sean Nelson (who had already proven his acting acumen inAmerican Buffalo) as the younger version of Epps. Although the cast is African American, there's no color bar to the themes or entertainment the movie offers, providing a salient lesson to network TV producers under attack by the NAACP for their inability to include characters of color in TV shows. Instead of stereotyping the characters by placing them in \"the hood,\" where gang members and tragedy rule, this life-affirming comedy depicts the lives of members of \"the wood,\" which refers to Inglewood, a middle-class suburb of L.A. that general audiences will find easy to relate to.--Lloyd Chesley", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000FS9ULC", "0800126084", "6303354734", "0780623622", "B00003L9CF", "6303022928", "0780608372"], "bought_together": ["0800126084"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 301038}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6305668426", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71FWJTPF54L._SY300_.gif", "title": "Wood [VHS]"}
{"description": "As they march into yet another devastated Italian town, one of the soldiers of Company C neatly sums up the average infantryman's experience of World War II: \"When this war's over, I'm gonna buy me a map and find out where I've been.\" Released less than three months after the German surrender,The Story of G.I. Joeis a gritty portrayal of the reality of war: defeat as well as victory, blood and mud as well as glory.William Wellman's film was based on the newspaper columns of war correspondent Ernie Pyle (played by Burgess Meredith), and through him we get to know a small group of ordinary infantrymen as he follows them from North Africa into Italy. They're led by Captain Bill Walker (Robert Mitchum), who claims he earned his rank by living longer than the other lieutenants, and Sergeant Warnicki (Freddie Steele), a tough, gruff career soldier who carries a carefully wrapped recording of his son's voice across Italy in search of a gramophone. The soldiers--many played by real veterans of the Italian campaign--mature as we get to know them, becoming battle-hardened but increasingly exhausted.Meredith is effective as Pyle, who quickly becomes something of a company mascot. He earns the respect of the GIs by sticking around when the shells start to fly, and he becomes an even bigger hit when he brings them all turkey and cigars at Christmas. But if this quintessential ensemble piece belongs to anyone, it's Mitchum as the battle-weary C.O. Fiercely loyal to his men, he feels every death as a personal loss but refuses to flinch from his duty. Mitchum brings an extraordinary depth of emotion to his performance, and he received a well-deserved Oscar nomination.Much of the film's strength lies in the contrast between the human side of war--bored men trying to stay sane in cramped dugouts--and the inhuman randomness of its destruction. After every battle, ambush, or artillery attack there's a terrible moment when we wait to see who is dead--\"We lost three,\" says Sergeant Warnicki as a few men stagger in from a patrol. The nerve-shatteringly realistic battle sequences bring to mindSaving Private Ryan, andThe Story of G.I. Joeis a strong competitor with Spielberg's acclaimed film for the title of greatest-ever war movie.Several of the soldiers who appear in the film, along with Ernie Pyle himself, died in action beforeThe Story of G.I. Joewas released. Fifty-five years later it still stands as a memorial to them and to all of the ordinary men and women who died in World War II.--Simon Leake", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000NTPG6Q", "B004B3QBE6", "B00CHYSSME", "B00ICWO1LC", "B00005OSJQ", "B0007TKNLU", "B00HZOXRCC", "B0001NBMH6", "B007MS6OH6", "B00E5N8SFC", "B002DNLT1Q", "B00005R23T", "B00005ASGB", "0803287682", "B007232DF8", "B00ALTQRUC", "B0001WTWWE", "B003B3NV5E", "B005H6RF8M", "B00BY0EBK0", "B0015S2OWI", "B00EVIOVM0", "B009W3VDEI", "B0002V8OAK", "B00A01CQIS", "B00K6D1QV8", "B000O599N0", "B002LH42FY", "B00GPPXNEE", "B00C2535TE", "B000O59A0C", "B0000C23T3", "B00005PJ8K", "B00005QCVP", "B003552QTU", "B00ED2SZLC", "B008BSM1CI", "B000O599NU", "1594204306", "B0007PALL6", "B001JPQWSE", "B00E44EZUE", "B001IZNIV4", "B00ARWXJ54", "B00D23GPH4", "B000RXVNDI", "B00CLH09UQ", "B00008AOTO", "B000WMA6G4", "B0009ML2KQ", "B00AEFY9YY", "B005HQBO9S", "B0007TKNLA", "B000062XEX", "B0001NBMHQ", "0792841662", "B000O599X0", "B00I3C1T3Y", "B008A1TWXC", "B0001FVDX2", "B008SAPC7K", "B00005PJ8L", "B00C3ALLPS", "B007FQXEQO", "B000O599LW", "B000NTPG5M", "B000127Z50", "B00005PJ8T", "B00B27WRNI", "B00000I1CR", "B00H1RMOI6", "B0007OP1XA", "B0007ZEOQE", "0767827902", "B0006B2A42", "B000EXDSBQ", "B0014BQR1A", "B009RWRINE", "B0026ZQJT8", "B00HW3L61U", "B008SAPCTS", "B007P6IWMA", "B00EKGXA84", "B000O78L0U", "B000FZETR0", "B00004XPPC", "B00005N5S3", "B00AEFYBA6", "B0000282RH"], "bought_together": ["B004B3QBE6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004B3QBE6", "B002DNLT1Q", "B0001FVDH8", "B0015S2OWI"]}, "price": 119.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 55855}, "asin": "6305837406", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Rat0koicL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Story of G.I.

{"description": "Pixar genius reigns in this funny romantic comedy, which stars a robot who says absolutely nothing for a full 25 minutes yet somehow completely transfixes and endears himself to the audience within the first few minutes of the film. As the last robot left on earth, Wall-E (voiced by Ben Burtt) is one small robot--with a big, big heart--who holds the future of earth and mankind squarely in the palm of his metal hand. He's outlasted all the \"Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class\" robots that were assigned some 700 years ago to clean up the environmental mess that man made of earth while man vacationed aboard the luxury spaceship Axiom. Wall-E has dutifully gone about his job compacting trash, the extreme solitude broken only by his pet cockroach, but he's developed some oddly human habits and ideas. When the Axiom sends its regularly scheduled robotic EVE probe (Elissa Knight) to earth, Wall-E is instantly smitten and proceeds to try to impress EVE with his collection of human memorabilia. EVE's directive compels her to bring Wall-E's newly collected plant sprout to the captain of the Axiom and Wall-E follows in hot pursuit. Suddenly, the human world is turned upside down and the Captain (Jeff Garlin) joins forces with Wall-E and a cast of other misfit robots to lead the now lethargic people back home to earth. Wall-E is a great family film with the most impressive aspect being the depth of emotion conveyed by a simple robot--a machine typically considered devoid of emotion, but made so absolutely touching by the magic of Pixar animation. Also well-worth admiring are the sweeping views from space, the creative yet disturbing vision of what strange luxuries a future space vacation might offer, and the innovative use of trash in a future cityscape. Underneath the slapstick comedy and touching love story is a poignant message about the folly of human greed and its potential effects on earth and the entire human race.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000VBJEEG", "B001KVZ6FW", "B00007LVCM", "B00BG0RSJ4", "B00AFEX83C", "0736424229", "B00005JN4W", "B00005JNQS", "B0042U94UQ", "B00E9ZATJO", "B001OMU6UM", "B00005JNS0", "B0030IIZ4M", "B0034JKZ86", "B002ZG97YM", "B002WJI2QQ", "B004HO6I4M", "B008YWY0HK", "B0012EM5D8", "B0006UEVT0", "B009SZCC9U", "B004G600A4", "B00AAXFYPI", "B00F522C7C", "B008Z1LBU4", "B00CTNYLQA", "B003H9M1Q2", "B000AAF1TU", "B008JFUQ16", "B000ROAK2W", "B000AY74OG", "B00275EHJG", "B00CWM58WY", "B00009M9BK", "B00EV1YZ96", "B001DPHDCY", "B000MV9026", "B001O5LVPI", "0783231474", "B00CQRN3QI", "B00G5G7EXY", "B00I6JOD2S", "B001HN6922", "B00GDT5T9Y", "B0087F7VSY", "B001U2MQE0", "B0030IIYYS", "B00A83075M", "B00H4Z07Q6", "B005LAIH4A", "B000DWMYQ8", "B00CHVJODE", "B0000AOX0O", "B003UESJF6", "B00JK531ES", "B00HLTD2OE", "B0001I561E", "B00BGYO7HG", "B003ZHVJGO", "B001ILFUD2", "B0002YLCOM", "B0039N74CW", "B00004U9WQ", "B00937R6QC", "B00CUDD0C0", "B004EPZ034", "B00004R99S", "B00003CXB4", "B000065V42", "B00005RDSQ", "B004ZBACOE", "B001GCUO7A", "B00AO686JC", "B000AAF1U4", "B0006JMLRK", "B00005JMQZ", "B0043X1FOK", "B00C7JGDBW", "B001JRB17Y", "B001KVZ6G6", "B00005TN8K", "B00005JMFH", "B00E9ZATKI", "B001ILFUDC", "B000V1Y44G", "B00003CX8Y", "B0011U52E2", "B00EBBGLFC", "B000YERP2S", "B00009YXAW", "B00003CXCQ", "B002NZK5SW", "B000G75AZC", "B00CNW9ZI6", "B0084IHVGG", "B00947N6D8", "B004LWZW7Y"], "bought_together": ["B001KVZ6FW", "B000VBJEEG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004HO6I4M", "B001KVZ6FW", "B00I6JOD2S", "B00005JN4W"]}, "price": 17.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 319062}, "asin": "7883706837", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51u-jDIxUZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)"}

{"description": "Kingdom Hospitalis horror novelist Stephen King's adaptation of Danish director Lars Von Trier's cult miniseriesThe Kingdom, geared very much for an American audience. The story unfolds across 15 hours, telling the story of a hospital in Maine that's been built on the site of a 19th-century mill fire that killed most of its young occupants--themes that King fans will be familiar with. In the present day, Kingdom Hospital is haunted by the ghost of 10-year-old child worker Mary and, even more bizarrely, a fearsome giant anteater-like creature called Antubis. It falls to the ace doctor Hook (Andrew McCarthy), the paraplegic artist Jack Coleman (Peter Rickman), and the hypochondriac psychic Sally Druse (Diane Ladd) to enlist the help of a surreal assortment of hospital staff and patients to help Mary and save Kingdom Hospital itself from certain doom.Fans of Stephen King will probably enjoy the blend of black comedy, spectral horror, and general weirdness, which owes a big debt to previous television series likeTwin Peaksand evenER. But too often,Kingdom Hospitalseems to be trying too hard to make itself into a cult series, something which King is just not a subtle enough writer to carry off. ButKingdom Hospitallooks good, especially the CGI Antubis, who steals every scene in which he appears.

{"description": "At first glance, Ren&eacute; Clair might seem an odd match for Agatha Christie's mystery thrillerTen Little Indians, but his buoyant touch is exactly what is missing from so many overly solemn remakes. Ten  strangers gather for a mysterious gathering on a secluded island. It turns out to be a farewell party, for they all have been sentenced to die for crimes in their past by a self-appointed judge, jury, and executioner who may be one of them. One by one, the guests are systematically dispatched in the manner described in the lyrics of the children's rhyme \"Ten Little Indians,\" while the survivors nervously eye one another, splintering into tenuous alliances until the next murder throws suspicion on someone new. The terrific cast of character actors has a ball with Dudley Nichols's witty script. The flamboyant sparring of Barry Fitzgerald (whose paternal Irish lilt takes a sinister dimension) and Walter Huston is almost upstaged by Roland Young's deadpan drollery. Romantic leads Louis Hayward and June Duprez come off as arch and stiff in august company that includes a sinisterly detached Judith Anderson, a dotty and distracted  C.&nbsp;Aubrey Smith, and a hilariously flippant Mischa Auer. The story has been  remade numerous times under the title of Christie's novel,Ten Little Indians, but never as well. Clair's effervescent, lively little gem is a fatal drawing-room comedy with a body count and a surreal mood of doom.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEFYO5I", "B000CSTK38", "B001KP2J3U", "B001KP2J3K", "B001KZOVJK", "B001KP2J44", "B000GB5M1A", "B00005RDRO", "B0090XLDO0", "B00AEFXNXW", "B000GB5M1U", "B002Q3MYA8", "B000GB5M1K", "B00GAXASKS", "B000068UE9", "B008RNYMPG", "B00K6D1QV8", "B000199JJI", "B000059LGD", "B00000JGHT", "B00A0HT99G", "B00005Q4D6", "0062073486", "B00008K772", "006226589X", "B004VLYHNA", "B0045HCJHG", "B00E44EZUE", "B00DZP1C9K", "B002MUAXJY", "B00BBI7EZY", "B0002HOEQ2", "B00GAXASLC", "B004HHX9H8", "B00000ILEU", "B00GWXI16O", "B0023Y543Y", "B003YCI238", "B001D8W7EU", "B001V7YZAM", "B007ISJS0U", "B001UWOLQG", "B005X5XI4C", "B001V7YZ9S", "B0085A9IWS", "B000CCW2TS", "B00GWXHYPI", "B00J2CB9BQ", "B004WMOSNM", "B007RKFXTE", "B00008ZZ7B", "B000083C6R", "B005X5XINI", "B006JY3O2M", "B005ETAN7C", "B0087ZG7OI", "B00GWXI0S8", "B00AEBBA7W", "B001V7YZA2", "B00DW5IKWK", "B0028AENVC", "B009TTGKS4", "B0026ZQJP2", "B001SMC9L2", "B0083HXKM2", "B0033PSHB8", "B0045HCJ9E", "B00D7AM2V0", "B000GAKFIG", "B003AND1TG", "B002OQZE6I", "B0006212JK", "6305416222", "B001D8W7EK", "B002945DUM", "B0001ZMWT6", "B001ARDBXK", "B001BSBBGC", "B002GSXKQA", "B00BDSRM4K", "B00000C0QO", "B00EF0NYVI", "B000QGDJG0", "B006Z4LP9K", "B00AQ6J5YA", "B001BSBBDK", "B0047CG95W", "B00CVB6XF2", "B000CRR36K", "B000CC1TNI", "B00871C09S", "B0000797E7", "B001LMAK6A", "B000B8380A", "B009TTGLJM", "B008K1PXIK", "B008BSM1CI", "B000SUHOFG", "B000R1JI32", "B00GHH9I62"], "bought_together": ["B00AEFYO5I", "B001KP2J3U"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AEFYO5I", "B00005RDRO", "B001KZOVJK", "0062073486"]}, "price": 9.95, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 85520}, "asin": "B00000IO3S", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21JR7V6YHQL.jpg", "title": "And Then There Were None"}

{"description": "Along with Sergio Leone's Clint Eastwood trilogy, Sergio Corbucci'sDjango, starring Belgian hunk Franco Nero as the gritty mercenary who drags a coffin behind him, was one of the most influential spaghetti Westerns. After mowing down armies of bad guys with his machine gun (which he brandishes in classic two-fisted tough-guy fashion--from the hip), he stages a daring gold heist from a Mexican military fortress and then plots to double-cross hisbanditopartners. Corbucci, who cowrote the story, fashions an unrelentingly violent tale of rival gangs squeezing the life out of a muddy, bloody border town, reveling in the sadism of the genre. The film opens with a woman strung up and lashed by a group of lascivious bandits, only to be saved by even more sadistic gunmen who plan to burn her alive, andDjangofan Quentin Tarantino borrowed the scene where a vindictive general slices the ear off a corrupt preacher forReservoir Dogs. While not as stylish as Leone's operatic epics,Djangopushed the borders of violence into all-new territory, and the film was banned outright in England and cut in the U.S. It spawned 20 unofficial sequels before Nero returned 20 years later for the only legitimate sequel,Django Strikes Again. In the meantime, Nero followed up this grimy antihero role with a turn as the singing medieval superknight Lancelot inCamelot!--Sean Axmaker", "price": 10.95, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 524950}, "asin": "B00002RASO", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51X8CG25D3L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Django [VHS]"}
{"description": "This is where is the Lynchian nightmare began. Though he may have redefined surrealistic cinema in the 1980s and forever altered the face of television in the 90s, for many hardcore fans it is this infamous feature film debut that is David Lynch's crowning achievement. Many words have been used to describeEraserhead(weird, bizarre, frustrating, enlightening, significant, unwatchable, meaningless, and momentous), but there is no denying it is completely unforgettable. As a surreal work of art,Eraserheadeasily holds it own next to the works as Bu&ntilde;uel, Cocteau, and Dali. And like many surrealistic works, there is no clear answer on whatEraserhead\"means.\" But, if you are trying to find a simple, linear, plot inEraserhead, you are clearly missing the point. ForEraserheadis not simply a movie to view, but a true cinematic experience, like jumping into someone's nightmare and seeing it from their perspective.  Whether you see it as a meditation on the terror of being a new parent, the suffocating feeling of living in an increasingly vapid, industrial wasteland, or a nightmare about the fear of loneliness, the film easily holds up to multiple viewings. And since this film is a dark visual ride and a supreme aural achievement, this long awaited, new transfer is an absolute blessing for David Lynch fans who will finally get to see, hear and experienceEraserheadclearly on DVD.  Bizarre experiment? Surrealistic nightmare? Or a meaningless cult film?

{"description": "To callPearl Harbora throwback to old-time war movies is something of an understatement. Director Michael Bay's epic take on the bombing that brought the United States into World War II hijacks every war movie situation and clich&#xE9; (some affectionate, some stale) you've ever seen and gives them a shiny, glossy spin until the whole movie practically gleams. Planes glisten, water sparkles, trees beckon--and Bay's re-creation of the bombing itself, a 30-minute sequence that's tightly choreographed and amazingly photographed, sets the action movie bar up quite a few notches. And in updating the classic war film, Bay and screenwriter Randall Wallace (Braveheart) use that old plot standby, the love triangle--this time, it's between two pilots (Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett) and a nurse (Kate Beckinsale) who find themselves stationed at Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, during what they thought would be a nice, sunny tour of duty. Then, of course, history intervened.For the first 90 minutes of the movie, Affleck and Beckinsale find a nice, appealing chemistry that plays on his strengths as a movie star and hers as a serious actress--he gives her glamour, she gives him smarts. Their truncated romance--the beginning of which is told in flashback so we can get right to the point where he has to leave her to go to England--works, thanks to their charm. They're no Kate and Leo fromTitanic(a strategy the film strives hard toward), but they're pretty darn adorable in their own right. Hartnett, as the not entirely unwelcome third wheel, squints bravely but makes only a slight dent in the film. Everyone else inPearl Harbor--from Cuba Gooding Jr.'s brave navy seaman to Jon Voight's able impersonation of FDR--is pretty much a glorified walk-on, taking a backseat to the pyrotechnics and action sequences that keep the three-hour film in fairly constant motion. But when that action does take hold,Pearl Harboris quite a thrilling ride.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792151712", "B000059HGY", "B00000K3AN", "B00AEBBA36", "0792133153", "079212569X", "6305169187", "6301734734", "0792147618", "0792116887", "6304618344", "079213690X", "6303269834", "6304925131", "6305718792", "6304259131", "B00004WIDB", "6304935811", "6303057225", "6304143184", "6302250269"], "bought_together": ["B00000K3AN", "B00AEBBA36"], "also_viewed": ["B00000G3PA", "0792151712", "6300213668", "B00000JS61", "6303215734", "6303402348", "B00004WIDB", "079213690X", "6305750750", "B004751DFU", "B00005O893", "B00000K3AN", "6301792734", "B00E5I2MCM", "6305169187", "B00007LVCM", "B007SPPANM", "B00L4K3MLE", "B00FLML7HW", "B008QZ5PY2", "B00JBGWP3Y"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 234413}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.49, "brand": "", "asin": "B00003CXTF", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HC1ZDJN6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]"}

{"description": "Julia Roberts outdoes herself in yet another David and Goliath struggle based on a true story. Erin Brockovich (Roberts) is a down-on-her-luck mother of three who can't seem to hold down a job. After having an auto accident, she makes a bumpy transition from client to employee at the law firm and stumbles onto a case with staggering implications. It seems that utility giant PG&E; has poisoned the groundwater and the local residents are getting gravely ill.\nThe story starts poorly with scenes of Erin looking for jobs and botching her accident case. The first twenty minutes of the film could have been condensed into five. However, once the investigation of the case begins, the story is engrossing. It is a powerful and well written human interest drama centered on a tough and smart (though crude) woman who leads a passionate crusade on behalf of the victims.\nDirector Steven Soderberg played it straight in filming this after his extremely avant-garde effort in \"The Limey\". His key strength here was the direction of the actors with both Julia Roberts and Albert Finney giving excellent interpretations of their characters. However, my only negative criticism of the film was the way Erin's boyfriend George was presented. George is a grubby tattoo covered biker (the tattoo on his left shoulder says \"DIRTY\") who behaves like Ward Cleaver with a ponytail. He is genteel, articulate, level headed, patient, sensitive and kind. All of this is so disconnected with his lifestyle that it seems inconceivable that a character this wonderful could possibly come in this package.\nJulia Roberts' gave a superlative performance that smashed any myth about her inability as a dramatic actor.", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783241569", "6301796535", "6303269834", "B008JFUNKU", "0790748169", "6303637574", "B0001E7LQG", "6304259131", "B00329TVQA", "0792116887", "6302936381", "6305426694", "6301734734", "0783222955", "B004IFIMT4", "6305368139", "B000007OY0", "0790751089", "B00007E2F6", "6300214222", "6302935148", "6302820448", "0800125762", "B000053VDQ", "B00005LQ1P", "B00004RT4K", "630394518X", "0782006779", "B0000040EO", "080018789X", "6302779278", "0792841859", "630266232X", "6303696813", "6304178352", "0793927501", "6301798503", "630233683X", "6300269043", "6301670159", "6302797667"], "bought_together": ["6301796535"], "also_viewed": ["6302158095", "6303637574"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 100360}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.58, "brand": "", "asin": "B00003CXFU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51D1C8BJXAL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Erin Brockovich [VHS]"}

She hooks up with a homeless street performer (Denis Lavant) who lives on a bridge in the middle of Paris that has been cordoned off for repairs. He falls madly in love with her; she can't bear the thought of being close to anyone. Both are more than a little irrational. But this banal scenario is merely the pretext for a series of lush and stunning images--including  midnight water-skiing, fireworks displays, wandering through falling snow, burning posters in subway tunnels--and richly committed performances from the actors. It's not quite as overwhelming on video as it is on a movie screen, but there's such a gushing of emotional images that it's hard to resist the angst and yearning passion. Though the film dives into some cliches, it manages to avoid others; when Binoche's wealthy family starts  looking for her, a frightened Lavant tries to keep her hidden away, and you really don't know whether their relationship can possibly survive.

{"description": "In the first season ofThe X-Files, creator Chris Carter was uncertain of the series' future, so each of the episodes is a self-contained suspense story; they do not delve deep into the ongoing X-Files mythology or turn to self-parody and humor as do episodes in later seasons. Yet, these episodes display the elements for which the show would become famous: the cinematic production values and top-notch special effects, the stark lighting of the Vancouver sets, the atmospheric halo of Mark Snow's score, and the clever plots dealing with subjects ranging from the occult, religion, and monsters to urban legends, conspiracy theories, and science fiction. Most importantly, season&nbsp;1 introduces FBI agents Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and Fox \"Spooky\" Mulder (David Duchovny), two of the most attractive government officials around. Scully is the serious-minded medical scientist assigned to join Mulder on the X-Files, a division of the FBI dealing with the paranormal. Mulder is the intuitive thinker with a dry wit, a passionate believer in the existence of paranormal phenomena and one of the few characters on television smart enough to figure out who the bad guy is before the audience does. Their muddled relationship, a deep friendship laced with sexual tension, provides the human heart in a world where the bizarre and horrible lurk in everyday society.The materials on the bonus disc provide some interesting trivia and background, but it is the 24 episodes themselves that make this seven-disc boxed set a true find. Those unfamiliar withThe X-Filesoften view all the fuss with the same skepticism with which Scully first regards her new partner's ideas. But just as she comes to realize the uncanny accuracy of Mulder's outlandish theories, newcomers toThe X-Fileswho sample a few episodes in this boxed set will likely find themselves riveted to their television late into the night. And undoubtedly, the shadows and creaking noises in the house that evening will seem more menacing than usual.--Eugene Wei", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000BOH98G", "B000BOH990", "B000CNE0SS", "B000CNE0T2", "B000CNE0TC", "B000EXDS34", "B000EXDS3E", "B000EXDS3Y", "B0007X7044", "B001G7PSZI", "B001FACH7S", "B0006UEVUE", "B001CY5N00", "B00005JA9M", "B0007ZEO7I", "B000002N3A", "B00CRVL5ZE", "B002GP7ZVY", "B00FXW9664", "B002GP7ZVO", "B000083C6V", "B00003CXIS", "B001G7PSSK", "B003V1IU3O", "B000ATQYWY", "B004X60QE2", "B000244E2O", "B0030E5PYO", "B002GP7ZV4", "B000NDEXK2", "B002ZCY872", "0792839056", "B0012CJQYG", "B0002I848K", "B000EBGFPY", "B000UX6THK", "B001C4CI8U", "B00BTYNXJG", "B00005JNOG", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B006BZ8NSE", "B00GTZWZH6", "B00465I156", "B000R7GKQE", "B0002PYS7Y", "B000F8O2Q0", "B000F8O2PQ", "B00466H3CW", "B0009X76XW", "B001T21R5U", "B00005Y1NF", "B000AQ68Z0", "B001BSBBGC", "B000063V8R", "B000BGR1B4", "B007C8RZQ0", "B002BWP2IK", "B0058JEHTS", "B002GP7ZW8", "B000667HBS", "B00DNUSFZQ", "B00CDAG0WW", "B00AEBB9AK", "B000FOPPBA", "B000056T4I", "B001FB4W0C", "B001KOFH2G", "B002JVWRAO", "B0009NZ2RE", "B004QOB8TS", "B000AJJNI6", "B0002ERWVE", "B00BM2JVAA", "0790742012", "B000VDDDY6", "B000F8O2OW", "B00HR2HTRQ", "B004YM6JI2", "B00005JNEQ", "B00003CXZ4", "B000FJH5M2", "B001MVWRNE", "0783225725", "B000EXDS7K", "B00019074O", "B000JLTRHW", "B003BNO9GO", "B001G0MFIS", "B0032JTV6A", "B000FIMG68", "B004LROMWU", "B00008972G", "B001DMVZJ4", "B0011UF79M", "B005FISBTO", "B001715A92", "B000P6YNSE", "B00009PY45", "B00BYNL8DU", "B008B4KVRE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00CRVL5ZE", "B000BOH990", "B000BOH98G", "B0007X7044"]}, "price": 1.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 170142}, "asin": "B00003RQND", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51G8JY0Q71L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The X-Files - The Complete First Season"}

{"description": "When Randy the video geek rattles off the rules of surviving a horror  movie in Wes Craven'sScream, he speaks for a generation of filmgoers  who are all too aware of slasher movie clich&eacute;s. Playfully scripted by  Kevin Williamson with a self-aware wink and more than a few nods to its  grandfathers (fromPsychotoHalloweento theFriday the  13thdynasty),Screamskewers teen horror conventions with loving  reverence while re-creating them in a modern, movie-savvy context. And so  goes the series, which continues the satirical spoofing by tackling (what  else?) sequels while sustaining its own self-contained mythology. Catty  reporter Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox) turns grisly murders into lurid  bestsellers, a cult of killer wannabes continues to hunt spunky  psycho-survivor Sydney Prescott (Neve Campbell) for their 15 minutes of fame, and a  cheesy movie series (Stab) develops within the movie series.Screamremains the high point of the series--a fresh take on a genre  long since collapsed into routine, butScream&nbsp;2spoofs itself  with witty humor (\"Why would anyone want to do that? Sequels suck!\" opines  college film student Randy), and delights with more elaborate set pieces and  all-new rules for surviving a horror movie sequel. The endangered veterans of  the original film reunite one last time forScream&nbsp;3, which plays  out on the movie set ofStab&nbsp;3. (It's a trilogy within a  trilogy!) With Williamson gone, replacement screenwriter Ehran Kruger tries  to mine the formula one more time. It's a little tired by now, and pale  imitations (Urban Legend,I Know What You Did Last Summer) have  further drained the zeitgeist, but the film bubbles with bright humor, and  director Craven is stylistically at the top of his game. As a trilogy, it  remains both the most consistently entertaining and self-aware horror series  ever made.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004LWZW2O", "B000A5045Q", "B003PIUINS", "B000RIWAVW", "B000FSME9W", "B008MXMFVE", "B004EPZ08O", "B000FA57UI", "B005CFC0N8", "6305300801", "6305017115", "B000FA57US", "B00AQJ8MLY", "B001DJLD1W", "B00005LC4Q", "B000RJUZOA", "B004AC6PMG", "0767824954", "B000Q66Q2O", "B001B1UO6W", "B004LWZW2Y", "B00AEFYYH6", "B004P7CN7W", "B004SIP9E2", "B0033B5XCS", "B002ZG99IG", "B004P7CNUY", "B0009MWEM6", "B000FOQ1KY", "B001NPD9LS", "B000VKL6Z2", "B0002JP572", "B004TI35YC", "B001DJLD0S", "B000V4UFZK", "B004P7CM9Q", "B00DTPRZ24", "B0009X763M", "B002R3G912", "B000FC2HS6", "B00CAATSME", "B00018D42W", "B001JFZ1UE", "B00AEFY37C", "B003Q6D27S", "B002AS45YM", "B0000CEB6Y", "B0000541TL", "B00441GYVK", "B000FWHW86", "B002ZG971U", "B0006SGYL0", "B000GETUDI", "B004LWZW24", "B003UGLCIA", "B003UN0752", "B00005A8XX", "B00275EHFU", "B005GT3X68", "B000EHRVP6", "B001AV3BWM", "B00006FI0R", "B00DTPRZ10", "B0053TWVDC", "B000083C6I", "B00008WFU4", "B00BM4Q4H6", "B00006FDCD", "B002G1WPI6", "B002YICNE2", "B008JFUNYG", "B00009PY4G", "B0000VCZMK", "B004AC6PV2", "B000FS9FE4", "B00004W4UD", "B000GBEWRU", "B00BEIYMAG", "B00003CXUP", "B001GCUO4S", "B005CFBZVG", "B000O77SQS", "B00000F0AD", "B008874968", "B0021L8UPS", "B00008WFU5", "B004SIP92O", "B00000IQC4", "B002VWNIDG", "B00079Z9WI", "B000UJ48P4", "B00L89VL96", "B0020PFYHC", "B0056P6SOG", "B0006SSOHC", "B000MM0LIM", "B001AGXEAG", "B00441GYVA", "B007STBUHI", "B00006FDBT"], "bought_together": ["B004LWZW2O"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00KDU8HQQ", "B004LWZW2O", "B004SIP9MY", "B004H83IM8"]}, "price": 36.0, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 141897}, "asin": "B00004W20F", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/416FN80BG7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Scream Trilogy - Boxed Set"}
{"description": "Thanks to Peter Schaffer'sAmadeus, Antonio Salieri has been  immortalized as the mediocre musician who probably poisoned Mozart in a fit of  jealousy over the latter's immense talent. While history has been less than kind  to Salieri, occasional stagings of his operas and recordings of his works show  that this ignorance is not entirely justified. His operaFalstaffis one  of several based on Shakespeare's immortal comic creation, and while not as  memorable as Otto Nicolai'sThe Merry Wives of Windsoror Verdi's  immortalFalstaff, Salieri's version passes its two hours onstage with a  pleasing comic touch.This 1995 performance from the Schwetzinger Festspiele in Germany is proof  positive that Salieri's operas can hold their own onstage. Director Michael  Hampe stages the farce at a brisk but never breakneck pace, and he and his  designers conjure up a plausibly comic world. John de Carlo looks exactly right  as the overbearing knight whose eye for the ladies leads to his comeuppance, and  he sings with brio. Conductor Arnold &#xD6;stmann and the Radio Symphony Orchestra  Stuttgart play the bright-sounding score with panache. Visually, thisFalstafflooks great, and aurally, the stereo mix is quite good. Since  this is an opera that's rarely recorded, let alone heard, this disc is a must  for fans of 18th-century music.--Kevin Filipski", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0007ACVBE", "B002XG8KOW", "B0000640T9", "B000BP86V4", "B0093OFLNU", "B0096KHX1E", "B00133KFHQ", "B001URA64C", "B000A3XYZA", "B002E9H3CI"], "bought_together": ["B0007ACVBE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0007ACVBE"]}, "price": 33.99, "categories": [["CDs & Vinyl", "Classical"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Opera & Classical Vocal"], ["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 445457}, "asin": "B00004W5WJ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/413QGYER6ML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Antonio Salieri: Falstaff"}

Armed with attitude and up against corrupt cops and venomous druglords, he's out to make crime pay up!", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000KG4BD6", "B00008977B", "B00003W8NT", "0792838076", "1558908390", "B00AEFY6TW", "6305505780", "B0000TWMT8", "B002AT8K9W", "B000E0WJOQ", "B003VA3JZY", "B0041QSZS8", "B0000696I2", "B00008EYA5", "0780618548", "B00007AJG1", "B00000JGHV", "B008B9JTLI", "B001KKU9DM", "B00003CXGV", "B002CA68NO", "B0000JBUHI", "B00AEBB9AA", "B00151QYSK", "B004U7MR14", "B000053VBA", "B008FCX2D2", "B0001FGBUW", "6305505802", "B00004STUL", "B002VWNIEA", "B00066FAVW", "B00005LB86", "0783237367", "B00BTYPWDQ", "B00066FAQW", "B000053VBC", "B000TLOMPE", "B000JYW5BO", "B00AEFYE08", "B00007L4KF", "B004SIP95G", "B002U4UZT0", "B000A2XAQ4", "6304821832", "B000056BOW", "B00DHDDE1Y", "B00009ZPUA", "B002CWKU3G", "B002CPMB9O", "B00007ELEO", "B00AEFYF2K", "B0000VJG72", "6305310335", "B001DJLD12", "B00005JLG1", "0783240295", "B00AEFY0XE", "0780627822", "0783240201", "6305428409", "B00004Y2R1", "B000YAF4Q6", "B00E1HIWU8", "0790742004", "B000JBXHQY", "B00AEFXT1S", "0792159659", "B002GHHHL0", "155890834X", "B000QXDCLU", "B000BT98XK", "B000HDZKLO", "B00124ONGA", "B002CA68N4", "0790732149", "B00AEFXEGS", "6304698747", "B003HTSJAY", "B00007AJG2", "B00005JL72", "B000U1ZV4Y", "B001JV5AZE", "B00AEBB9NM", "B00003CY51", "B002CWKU2M", "6304779631", "B003BV8I3Q", "B00177YFYM", "B00096S49Y", "B002GHHHME", "B00003L9CG", "B00005JPD0", "B004SIPAP0", "B001MZ5W3M", "B00BTYRB2G", "B0041QSZ9M", "B000P0J0CE", "B00003CXGG", "6304711891"], "bought_together": ["B000KG4BD6", "B0000TWMT8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000KG4BD6", "B001JV5AZE", "B000BT98XK", "B003VA3JZY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 44275}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.99, "brand": "Paramount", "asin": "B00004Z1FX", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ECQBDCKHL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Shaft"}

Chokkei is the blushing teenage boy whose innocent charm earns him the protection of the buxom title character, the \"lovely warrior\" android who fights evil while losing her clothes with a frequency that would shock Little Annie Fannie.

{"description": "A double bill starring Frosty:Frosty the SnowmanJimmy Durante narrates this Christmas story that is based on the song of the  same name. To make up for the fact that her students are in school on Christmas  Eve, the local schoolteacher hires the magician Professor Hinkle to entertain  the kids. Unfortunately, he's not a very good magician. Frustrated in his attempt to pull a rabbit out of his hat, he throws it away in anger. Outside, the kids build a snowman (what to call it? Harold? Oatmeal? Frosty!), and when the hat blows onto it--Happy Birthday!--it comes to life. Professor Hinkle decides he wants the hat back so he can make money off of its newfound magical properties, but the kids want to save Frosty. When the temperature starts to rise, a new problem threatens Frosty's existence. Karen, the leader of the children, comes up with a plan to save him: take him on a train to the North Pole, where it's always cold. With a cameo by Santa Claus, and the promise of Frosty's return every year, this  story of life, death, and holiday cheer is glazed with the sweet frosting of  hope and happiness. A true holiday classic.Frosty ReturnsIn the same way that many a Hollywood sequel has little to do with the first film,Frosty Returnshas almost nothing in common with the originalFrosty the Snowman, aside from a man made of snow. The biggest difference is that this Frosty doesn't need a magic hat to come to life. The story: In the town of Beansboro, old Mr. Twitchell has invented an aerosol spray that can remove snow without the hassle of shoveling or plows. This frightens Frosty, who enlists the help of amateur magician Holly and her friend Charles to stop the old coot. Made in 1992,Frosty Returnshas an animation style that looks like a cross between the old Schoolhouse Rock and Peanuts cartoons, with voice talent that includes Jonathan Winters, Andrea Martin, Jan Hooks, Brian Doyle-Murray, and John Goodman as Frosty. The story may be divisive, pitting children against adults and a pro-snow contingent against anti-snow people, but the songs are catchy and the message is one that ultimately empowers kids. Like a hero from an old Western, this Frosty is a wanderer who leaves when his job is done so he can work his magic elsewhere.--Andy Spletzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B003P3PQOO", "B000R7G6KO", "B0002M5U7E", "B002JUFPUE", "B001CO42J8", "B005AU4SBC", "B000S0PLGA", "B000GFRI7M", "B000R7G6KY", "B001CO32FS", "B003U0AHG4", "B001NPDO90", "B0002M5U6A", "B00005NB93", "B003P3PQMQ", "B00004VVP9", "B00006II5M", "B008NNY8A4", "B00005LOUP", "0307960382", "B001CW8016", "B000HT3PPG", "B008GY0POI", "B0006IIOIQ", "B000AGTPUK", "B00004TS0E", "B000VBIGCW", "B000BVM1T6", "B000S6LP5A", "B001D7T6AE", "B0057FGCJQ", "B000R7G6JK", "B002VA5A16", "B0006419KA", "B00005N7Z0", "B001DPHDBA", "6305950547", "B00008N6NQ", "B000HEWEJO", "B005QODEEE", "B003NFM3JK", "B00DZP1BOG", "B001CO32FI", "B0019KAQEU", "B00DZP1BKK", "0545450055", "B002MU4NN6", "B001CO42IO", "B000VBIGD6", "B005BYBZPY", "B002VA5A0M", "B0052OPJ1E", "B000068TR1", "0824956567", "B002K2KMMW", "B005MQXZGI", "0375875115", "B003X3BYG0", "B000YABV7W", "B003YCIE68", "B00DGWZK0Y", "B000OLGCIE", "0824919106", "B002HQZX8Y", "B002WZUNX0", "B000HC2LH6", "B0009OUAZW", "B000TJBN6W", "B00275EHJG", "B003Z8ZCFW", "B00DS79H9C", "6301752627", "B0000694ZS", "B00005MEPA", "B001DJLD1W", "B0010KP374", "B0010DM4EG", "1623540127", "B00G5G7EXY", "B006942FGS", "B00008X5J7", "B007FC393G", "B00F522C7C", "B0000AI42B", "B00005K9OF", "B001U7NVXA", "B00DZP1BJ6", "B0002F6BRE", "B00GDT5T9Y", "B00CNW9ZI6", "B005BXY1R4", "B003H9M1Q2", "0395389496", "B008UY8FI2", "B00006JZI2", "B000002QUV", "B00G5G7K7O", "B0030IIYYS", "B0007A0F4E", "B00EEBNCI8"], "bought_together": ["B003P3PQOO", "B002JUFPUE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003P3PQMQ", "B0057FGCJQ", "B003P3PQOO", "B002JUFPUE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 314489}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 24.95, "brand": "Sony Pictures Home Entertainment", "asin": "B000051XIW", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51VYMT32SWL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Frosty the Snowman/Frosty Returns"}
{"description": "Popular horror director Yoshisaki Kawajiri (Ninja Scroll) served as head writer on this 1995 feature. Komada and Koshigaya are scientists--and Bio Hunters, agents who battle the Demon Virus that causes humans to mutate into weird monsters. Komada has contracted the virus, but something in his immune system enables him to control his transformations. When Komada rescues Sayaka Murakami, the granddaughter of a famed psychic, from a gang of thugs, he unwittingly pits the Bio Hunters against the powerful politician Seijuro Tabe. The partners discover that Tabe is actually the horrible monster that's been roaming Tokyo, killing young women and eating their livers. He's no longer human, but a corpse possessed by the devil. The final battle pits Komada in his monster form against the tentacles and fanged jaws of the possessed Tabe, although Koshigaya administers the coup de gr&acirc;ce. A well-directed, violent entertainment,Bio Huntersuffers from a disjointed story: the link between Tabe's possession and the Demon Virus is never established. The ending suggests that the film may have been intended as a pilot, as Koshigaya declares the Bio Hunters' dedication to the ongoing battle against the Virus.Bio Hunteris not for viewers with weak stomachs. Not rated; suitable only for ages 18 and up for nudity, sex, violence, cannibalism, grotesque imagery, and violence against women.--Charles Solomon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00004YZGB", "B00005V1XW", "B00005BCKE", "B005CVFZ16", "B0007939U2", "B000056MMA", "B000031EG6", "B0000APVFZ", "6304493681", "B009AVC922", "B00AIZ2LR2", "B00H9GIAQY", "B00005V4XG", "6305167257", "B00E00G9AQ", "1586640038", "B00000JL4L", "B001808CWE", "B00000JL42", "B000E5LF0K", "B00000JL4M", "6305262314", "B0007CNXYQ", "B00ENNBZ68", "B008YRL6WM", "B000OYCMNU", "B00006BSGS", "B004FHCHA0", "B00005KB6H", "B000UFAUUU", "B000FILUL0", "B0000B1OC6", "B00843TZEC", "B00HFC547A", "B00GRZPQR4", "B000NNUWYI", "B00005NG6U", "B00000IBUG", "B00014X8KO", "B00GS1GWRU", "B00000F0VU", "B00HFC30A8", "B00393UF6O", "B001AYWYEA", "B008NNY9YE", "B001N2WJ44", "B001CZJP0S", "B000Q66PX4", "B0009P42S2", "B00EV5I8JA", "B009AVCAJ4", "B003UNG8H8", "B000TZN7KQ", "B00BQ1DDUG", "B005WMQ5R8", "B0000WN0MS", "B007S9XXFA", "B0002J4X3Y", "B004SGWYVA", "B00E688U9K", "B00DNQM7M2", "B002CWKTQ4", "B008YRL7JE", "B004TP55PM", "B00005UW7E", "B00A92MDMM", "B001SGEUC4", "B004RIACSQ", "B00F9F4DX6", "B003UNASK6", "B00005QBZ9", "B00004Z4WG", "B001VFM5YW", "0767836316", "B009T3AHPC", "B009RZ890M", "B005SH647S", "B008HHTEUU", "B00000EZX5", "B00007M5JH", "B00CJ7XZFO", "B00DOZNGTK", "1573306886", "B00003UCAV", "B000087F31", "B007ILZAA4", "B00D44IQQE", "B004JPJHMY", "B000XSKDJW", "B005VAB7AQ", "B00B40N2UK", "B000063K2F", "B00441GYS8", "B0083QJVJO", "B00008K777", "B0001WTWMY", "B00012FWZ0", "B00B1RB8AC", "B0007R4TFI", "B002KX9CPO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B009AVC922", "B005CVFZ16", "B00ENNBZ68", "B0007939U2"]}, "price": 10.72, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 170416}, "asin": "B0000541S4", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514V9RPTK5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "BioHunter (Special Edition)"}

{"description": "It's a good thing Sandra Bullock knows her strengths and weaknesses, because without Bullock as star and producer,Miss Congenialitywould be an insufferable mess as opposed to being a mildly enjoyable trifle that is custom-made for Bullock's established screen persona. Only Bullock's fans could really appreciate this fluff (even then they'll wish its ripe premise had been more intelligently handled), but it's not without some highlights to accompany Bullock's reliable charms. Here she plays clumsy, nerdy FBI agent Gracie Hart, who is given the horrific pseudonym Gracie Lou Freebush (one example of the movie's juvenile tendencies) when assigned to infiltrate a beauty pageant to investigate threats of a terrorist attack.Transforming Bullock from frumpy to stunning is a piece of cake (although she gives pageant coach Michael Caine a run for his money), so the movie's premise is trivial at best. More enjoyable is her character's uncouth disdain for pageant contestants and her mistaken perception that they're all a bunch of bimbos. The movie nicely charts Gracie's realization that her own pageant makeover provides a much-needed ego boost. In addition to Caine's effortless scene-stealing, pageant host William Shatner and organizer Candice Bergen are smart choices for comedic support (Shatner's a perfect Bert Parks wannabe), but the movie desperately needs a credible foundation for its comedy to really pay off. Bullock's bureau boss (Benjamin Bratt) is an unconvincing dimwit, and none of the plotting is as smart as sayBeverly Hills Copin combining procedure with laughs. That leaves Bullock to carry the burden of a comedy that just barely works in her favor.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0009KA2OA", "B00005O5CM", "B00005JM55", "6304765266", "B002K0WBXW", "B00081U7HC", "B00AEFXO8Q", "B00003CXSM", "B00006ZXSL", "B00008NRI7", "B002VECM6S", "B00007E2F5", "B0006GANOQ", "B00AEBB8NS", "B00003CXMP", "B0000524E5", "B00AEFY99O", "B00006FMUW", "B000HEWEE4", "B002NZK5V4", "B000YDBPAM", "B000QQLVPQ", "B00AEBB8R4", "B000CEV3M8", "B002O3Z50G", "B004SEUJK0", "B000J4QW7W", "B00E8RKHWW", "B002O3Z4ZW", "B00AEFYM2S", "B000209KMW", "B00AEFY4CG", "B00006ZXSK", "B0045HCJJ4", "B00447L4KA", "B00AMEZDJW", "B00008WJD6", "B0000897EG", "B000QUU4LY", "B000MQC9H4", "B00AEFXYOA", "B0000DIXDR", "B000XT1P3E", "0800177258", "0783225504", "B000NA1WE0", "6305236569", "B000023VTP", "B000FO0A9W", "B002SYAGNC", "B001ECDVK4", "B00003CXFV", "B00AEFYF2K", "B000J103OI", "B00005JG6N", "B0036TGSIK", "B00466HN7M", "B00000G3PA", "B0000AOV4I", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00AEFY5TI", "B0015I2RT8", "B001ECDVJU", "B004SIP8JI", "B00005KAQP", "B000ELJAEM", "B0049TC88U", "B002NZK5UU", "B00006ZXSQ", "B00008G8M4", "B004SIP9RO", "6305212112", "B000A343RI", "B004SIP9X8", "0783225733", "6302077818", "B002GHHHP6", "B002GIBVWA", "B00AEBB9WI", "0800141806", "B000683VI4", "B00795C5X4", "B002NZK5RS", "B00003CXTA", "B000JYW5BE", "B00005JM9Q", "B004EPZ070", "B00AEFXZJE", "B003L20IHE", "B007L6VMDK", "B0038N9X3Q", "B00386EZKE", "B000CCBCAI", "B00007BKVC", "0783235070", "B00AEFXWXI", "B000CEV3KU", "B00005BCKF", "B00AEBB8YW", "B0006N2EZ0"], "bought_together": ["B00005O5CM"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000NA1WE0", "B003PIUIJC", "6304765266", "B00005O5CM"]}, "price": 9.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 77252}, "asin": "B00005AAA9", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514V9KPFJRL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Miss Congeniality"}
{"description": "This five-hour miniseries, which was hailed as both a critical triumph and a milestone \"television event\" when it originally aired in 1974, is based on theLeon Uris novel, which itself was based on a libel trial that arose after Uris published his novelExodus. The fictionalized drama is essentially the story of two men, Dr. Adam Kelno, a Polish doctor who was imprisoned by the Nazis in a concentration camp, and Abe Cady, a successful Hollywood writer who publishes a serious book on the Holocaust that exposes Kelno's past.  Playing Dr. Kelno, Anthony Hopkins steals the show, and the nuances he brings to the character keep the audience guessing whether he is in fact a dedicated healer or a diabolical villain intent on papering over a fiendish past. Ben Gazzara is credible as the tough-talking Cady, but when Hopkins leaves the action for a time the film sags and begins to resemble an ordinary TV movie. Eventually the two men's lives come into conflict when Kelno sues for libel. The trial, which takes place in a London courtroom (the \"Queen's Bench VII\" of the title), seeks to sort out the truth about the past of Dr. Kelno. His precise activities during the war, and how the world deals with his past, receive intelligent and dramatic treatment.--Robert J.

{"description": "The alumni ofHollywood Shuffleare spread across dozens of current comedies and TV sitcoms--this is the movie that introduced Robert Townsend and the Wayans Brothers to the world. Townsend plays a young actor who struggles with being offered stereotyped street hustler roles while trying to maintain his self-respect and the approval of his family. Between scenes of comically humiliating auditions, Bobby has satirical fantasies about the plight of black actors, including the classic \"Black Acting School\" sketch, in which white teachers demonstrate jive talk and street moves for the befuddled black students. Townsend has a charming, low-key comic style, one considerably more subtle than that of some of the black comics who have risen to success with supposedly self-aware renditions of the stereotypes Townsend mocks. Townsend made this movie on his credit cards and it is clearly a heartfelt labor of love.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000053VBC", "B00008W2QE", "B0015XHP1S", "B0001AP0CM", "B000XJD34S", "B00007BK2Q", "B0000714BU", "B000051YMS", "B000BOH8X2", "B00005JD5H", "B000089738", "B00007BK2T", "B00007GZRP", "B00AEBB9AA", "B00AEFY6TW", "B000TLOMPE", "B00003W8NT", "B00AEFXP8K", "B00AEFYG3S", "B00005A1TJ", "B002U4UZT0", "B000035P59", "B002YVHOKW", "B004P7CMZ0", "B00441GZ1Y", "B00005T30A", "B008NNY8PO", "B004YCKJGU", "B0000696I2", "B00HPVW5B4", "6305505780", "0780627857", "B00005JD5J", "B0041QSZS8", "B000059TGC", "B000BUE5FA", "B0024EWP6W", "0767811070", "B00005N89R", "B000071ZZJ", "6305840083", "B00AEFYE08", "B002CA68N4", "630592273X", "0767813901", "B00005JLG1", "B00005JL72", "B001SGEUGK", "B00066FAQW", "B003NH6FY2", "B002CWKU36", "B00008978S", "B0000TWMT8", "B0000YEE6M", "B000GFRICM", "B000053VB8", "B000068TP8", "B0000549B2", "B00006HAYO", "0792838076", "B002VWNICM", "1558908390", "B00008977B", "B0000JBUHI", "B00BTYPWDQ", "B00005JK8N", "B00005RIIY", "6305308802", "B00000JGHV", "6305308799", "B003NH42HE", "B000JJSL1W", "B00007L4KF", "B000P0J0CE", "B0000TWMQ6", "B00005B1X4", "B00BTYRB2G", "B000056WR6", "B00465I1CE", "B0000AM6J1", "6305428409", "B00315I6DE", "B0000DD76R", "B0000TWMWA", "B00005N89M", "B0006IIPJO", "B00005UPFK", "B000KG4BD6", "B00003CY51", "B004SIP93S", "B00007AJG1", "B00004Y2R1", "B00003L9CG", "0767818075", "B00066FABM", "B00CPKZKX0", "B0009ML1Z2", "B000BTITFI", "B0001NBMIK", "B000B5XOSY"], "bought_together": ["B000053VBC", "B00005JD5H"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004I9AQU8", "B000053VBC", "B00EPME7HQ", "B00005JD5H"]}, "price": 44.95, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 84511}, "asin": "B00005BKZL", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51F52VXYAJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Hollywood Shuffle"}

{"description": "Hailed as \"the most romantic film of the year!\" (Bill Zwecker, Fox-TV) Academy Award winner Gwyneth Paltrow (Shakespeare in Love) and Aaron Eckhart (Erin Brockovich) star in this sexy, seductively intriguing mystery. Maud Bailey (Paltrow) and Roland Michell (Eckhart) are two dedicated literary scholars with nothing in common - except their obsession with the two Victorian poets they have devoted their lives to studying. But all that changes when a newly discovered cache of love letters reveals the two poets were entangled in a forbidden affair. Now, as Maud and Roland embark on a wildly romantic journey in search of the truth, the mystery of the past will engulf them, as the passions of the present possess them.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004SUDQ22", "B000BOH904", "0679735909", "B00AEBB8P6", "B001RJ1Y62", "B004SIP7AS", "6305692696", "B000JJ5G4W", "B00I6JODGO", "B00005JOA0", "B002AT8KAG", "B006YTGL3G", "B004XVMCMQ", "B00005JMJD", "B00HUAGZ34", "0767812115", "0800141660", "B00005ALMM", "B000ZS8GW6", "B000Z27HLS", "B002ZFEQ76", "B004499LWG", "B005T0OY5S", "B004SIP9U6", "B00005OBAL", "0788815490", "B004SIP7D0", "B000EBD9VC", "B004SEUIZG", "B00006FD9P", "B000784WNQ", "B000N4SHOE", "B000EDWLTQ", "B004P7CNZO", "B00003JRCQ", "B0080QOL10", "B004AE3QYE", "B00AF82WTO", "B004U7MQZ6", "B00G6HO368", "B00005LOKU", "B006YTGL86", "B00F1BFRA6", "B0001US61O", "B0064MT1U8", "B005CFC0HE", "B004BZ5AGY", "B004P7CMUU", "B004SIP8JI", "0790730979", "0767020308", "B0018M6J90", "B000F3UAFC", "B00005JPSM", "B000LPQ6DE", "B001C4AFOY", "B0000372I3", "B004JMSIQS", "0767847415", "B006GL8NTW", "B002WY65VA", "0767806786", "B007A2O3FO", "B00GS08Y3Q", "B0001US7Q8", "B0000AQS3P", "0767815718", "B00023BKO0", "B00062IZ0Y", "0826452485", "B000E1ZBGS", "B00B89WZG4", "B000BITVAG", "B0045O2PHS", "B00AZMFO6I", "B00CIOD6HK", "0790732947", "B0080QOL1A", "B004QDRW0S", "B00JAQJMJ0", "0679738290", "B002I5GNZQ", "B0000844LU", "B003EA45EA", "B0007NFLO0", "B009T6CXG0", "B000CEV3M8", "B000M2E32M", "B00005YUNK", "B000NOIX48", "B000085OY1", "B00004WI57", "B00003CXC9", "B00AKGG6JS", "B001L57ZZG", "B004EQAVHI", "B0001GOH7K", "0783239416", "B00G7QPXAI", "B0046ZYEUW"], "bought_together": ["B000BOH904", "B00AEBB8P6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0679735909", "B000BOH904", "B00AEBB8P6", "B004SUDQ22"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 39150}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 10.41, "brand": "PALTROW,GWYNETH", "asin": "B00005JKKY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51220SPRBNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Possession"}

{"description": "WithThe Return of the King, the greatest fantasy epic in film history draws to a grand and glorious conclusion. Director Peter Jackson's awe-inspiring adaptation of the Tolkien classicThe Lord of the Ringscould never fully satisfy those who remain exclusively loyal to Tolkien's expansive literature, but as a showcase for physical and technical craftsmanship it is unsurpassed in pure scale and ambition, setting milestone after cinematic milestone as the brave yet charmingly innocent Hobbit Frodo (Elijah Wood) continues his mission to Mordor, where he is destined to destroy the soul-corrupting One Ring of Power in the molten lava of Mount Doom. While the heir to the kingdom of Men, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), endures the massive battle at Minas Tirith with the allegiance of the elf Legolas (Orlando Bloom), dwarf Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) and the great wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen), Frodo and stalwart companion Samwise Gamgee (Sean Astin) must survive the schizoid deceptions of Gollum, who remains utterly convincing as a hybrid of performance (by Andy Serkis) and subtly nuanced computer animation.Jackson and cowriters Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens have much ground to cover; that they do so with intense pacing and epic sweep is impressive enough, but by investing greater depth and consequence in the actions of fellow Hobbits Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd), they ensure thatReturn of the Kingmaintains the trilogy's emphasis on intimate fellowship. While several major characters appear only briefly, and one (Christopher Lee's evil wizard, Saruman) relegated entirely to the extended version on DVD, Jackson is to be commended for his editorial acumen; like Legolas the archer, his aim as a filmmaker is consistently true, and he remains faithful to Tolkien's overall vision. IfReturnsuffers from too many endings, as some critic suggested, it's only because the epic's conclusion is so loyally inclusive of the actors--most notably Astin--who gave it such strength to begin with. By ending theLOTRtrilogy with noble integrity and faith in the power of imaginative storytelling,The Return of the King, like its predecessors, will stand as an adventure for the ages.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JKZV", "B00003CWT6", "B00BEZTMFY", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B002ZG980U", "B002PMV9FG", "B008UZA8FY", "B001NGML48", "B00005JM5E", "B001GZ6QC4", "B005COPWZW", "B008M4C1EO", "B00HFFE8HE", "039548930X", "B000W7F5SS", "B000I0RQVI", "B002VWNIDG", "B000E6EK2Y", "B001BYMX4A", "B004M1A21K", "B007K3JFUQ", "B001DHXT20", "B001UV4XHY", "0345325818", "B003Y5H54W", "B00005JNJV", "B00E5I2M6I", "B000A3XY5A", "B004LWZWGA", "B000U7WV1Y", "B005LXQLRW", "B001OQCV6A", "B000E8M0VA", "B004SIP8ZM", "B000EHRVMY", "0618640150", "B003ZK99NQ", "B0013FDM7E", "B00005JPH2", "B000UNYK4E", "B009JBWOU0", "B00003CX5P", "B00008G8M5", "B00GKOJ98E", "B004LWZW42", "B000H30B2C", "B000P0J0C4", "B00CZDLGDU", "B000M341QE", "B00008G8M4", "B000FKO5QK", "B00HWWUQYY", "B007SPPANM", "B008JFUO72", "B001DJLD1M", "0345538374", "B00AEFY5B6", "B00005JKCH", "B004SIP9U6", "B000YGGNMO", "B00E5I2M9K", "0618126988", "B005OCFGTO", "B00E8S2JZ4", "6305313687", "B004AKCME8", "B0002KVUKM", "B000AARKOO", "B0006GAO5Y", "B000K7VHQ4", "B002ZG997C", "B00AHTYI5M", "B008JFUS0U", "B0042MEQVG", "B00275EGWY", "B00E9PMML2", "B008UZDXEW", "B004SIP7F8", "B00116GEJS", "B00003CXI1", "B003ZKBELG", "B003Y5H5EW", "B000V4UFZK", "B0007PLLBU", "B001DTPZNY", "B002O3Z50Q", "B001GCUO1Q", "B000LP6KNU", "B005G4TJUC", "B00AW0KHTM", "B002ZG97YM", "054792819X", "B00AEFXZJE", "B0000YEEGM", "B002IPFWTE", "B001ECQ75A", "B000065U1N", "B0051MKNV8", "B000W796OM", "B00J49R1BY"], "bought_together": ["B00005JKZV", "B00003CWT6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00HFFE8HE", "B00003CWT6", "B00005JKZV", "B00BEZTMFY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 1589}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.49, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00005JKZY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HS7iSFv5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)"}

{"description": "A Beautiful Mindmanages to twist enough pathos out of John Nash's incredible life story to redeem an at-times goofy portrayal of schizophrenia. Russell Crowe tackles the role with characteristic fervor, playing the Nobel prize-winning mathematician from his days at Princeton, where he developed a groundbreaking economic theory, to his meteoric rise to the cover ofForbesmagazine and an MIT professorship, and on through to his eventual dismissal due to schizophrenic delusions. Of course, it is the delusions that fascinate director Ron Howard and, predictably, go astray. Nash's other world, populated as it is by a maniacal Department of Defense agent (Ed Harris), an imagined college roommate who seems straight out ofDead Poets Society, and an orphaned girl, is so fluid and scriptlike as to make the viewer wonder if schizophrenia is really as slick as depicted. Crowe's physical intensity drags us along as he works admirably to carry the film on his considerable shoulders. No doubt the story of Nash's amazing will to recover his life without the aid of medication is a worthy one, his eventual triumph heartening. Unfortunately, Howard's flashy style is unable to convey much of it.--Fionn Meade", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004SIP7ZS", "B0043X1FL8", "B004FQX5B6", "B00AEFZ63M", "B0000YEEGM", "B00003CWQR", "B000ARTN3I", "B000EHQU0S", "6305144168", "0767811100", "B000066HAS", "B000P0J0EW", "B00AEFYSWM", "B0002B15ZG", "1451628420", "B00000IQV7", "B000021Y7L", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00AEFY5B6", "B003ASLJQI", "B000XJD3JI", "B004SUDQ22", "B004U7MR1Y", "B00A81MV3U", "B0043X1FM2", "B00B0U2SFE", "B002NZK5UK", "B000N6U0E2", "B003B3NGS6", "B00AEBB9F0", "B00AEBB8NI", "B00004RJ73", "B00003CWRX", "B00125WAWS", "B00005JLSB", "6305428352", "B00008EY60", "0800141806", "B00001ZWUS", "B00011CZRE", "B00AEBB9CS", "6304712936", "0780619587", "B00007GZR5", "B000YAF4MA", "B000KX0IOA", "B004SIP8W0", "B00080ZG10", "B00B9LNPA6", "0783225733", "B003U0AHBO", "B00004BZIY", "B00005JND5", "B000E33VWW", "B003NF97NK", "B0038M2AZA", "B002CPMB9O", "B000P0J0EM", "B000A3XY5A", "B00AFEXRME", "B00005Q4CS", "B000LC55F2", "B00AEBB9SM", "B0006FYOTC", "B000056VP4", "B002WNU0QW", "B000RTB0R6", "0684819066", "B00003CXZ4", "B00AEFY17E", "B000EGDB10", "B002VECM6S", "B002ZG980U", "B001P9KR8U", "B001N44BVQ", "B000LP6KNU", "B0007DFJ0G", "B0002V7ON8", "B0018CWW5K", "B00JPQ1INI", "B0030Y12FU", "B003ELKNH2", "B000K2UGZM", "B00121QGPY", "B0001CNRAM", "B00003CXFV", "0783223609", "B007N31YH0", "B002HK9IDQ", "B005BYBZEK", "B000JJ5F8O", "B00AEFYXJ0", "B003UESJHO", "B00A7MSQSO", "B004SIP9U6", "B00005JL78", "B00012QLB4", "B003UESJH4", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B000K7VHQE"], "bought_together": ["B004SIP7ZS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00C7MW5EI", "B004SIP7ZS", "B001F34HRS", "B00001ZWUS"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 3605}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.99, "brand": "UNI DIST CORP.

{"description": "With its disturbing images and a few good shocks,The Ringis the kind of frightfest you'll watch to set a chilling mood or spook your susceptible friends, but when you try to sort it out, this well-mounted American remake (of the 1998 Japanese hitRingu, based on Koji Suzuki's popular novel) becomes a batch of incoherent parts. The negligible plot follows a Seattle reporter (Naomi Watts) as she investigates the death of her niece, the victim of a mysterious videotape that, according to urban legend, causes the viewer's death seven days later. (Fear Dot Comborrowed the same idea while avoiding this film's lofty pretensions.) The countdown structure follows the reporter, her son, and her estranged boyfriend into deepening layers of terror--all quite effective until the movie attempts to explain itself.

{"description": "James Bond DVDs have in general been pretty loaded, butDie Another Dayraises the bar with a two-disc set featuring dynamic DTS 6.1 ES and Dolby Digital 5.1 EX sound that makes good use of the rear speakers. The first commentary track is by Pierce Brosnan and Rosamund Pike (who plays villain Miranda Frost). They weren't together at the time, so their comments are spliced into one track. Brosnan has a good time watching and is proud of the film but also doesn't take himself too seriously (\"They don't teach you this stuff at drama school: 'OK, now you're going to be electrocuted by the bad guy.'\"). Self-proclaimed \"Bond novice\" Pike also is proud of the film and says she's annoyed by people who question whether there's still a need for Bond. On the second commentary track, director Lee Tamahori and producer Michael G. Wilson chat about topics as diverse as casting, Bond lore, and product placements. For more Bond lore, don't overlook the trivia track, which offers pop-up tidbits about the filming and tips on the inside jokes.The centerpiece of the second disc is the 80-minute \"InsideDie Another Day\" documentary, which is a set of featurettes strung together. Topics include the opening surfing sequence; the scenes set in North Korea and Cuba (including Halle Berry's bikini tribute to Ursula Andress); the ice palace; post-production elements such as computer graphics, editing, and music; the car battle (finding strong ice was the key safety issue); and the passing of the \"Q\" torch from Desmond Llewellyn to John Cleese.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000NIBURQ", "B000M53GM2", "B000RPCK1U", "B000NDEXPM", "B000M53GMW", "B000RPCK1K", "B000RPCK24", "B000NIBURG", "B000M53GLS", "B000RPCK1A", "B000NIBUR6", "B000M53GN6", "B001PPLIEG", "B001R10BN2", "B00AQSN7HE", "B000RPCK0Q", "B000M53GNG", "B000NIBUS0", "B000NDEXPC", "B00004RG62", "B000M53GMC", "B007REV4T8", "B00004WEJZ", "B00005JL0I", "B009PN18R2", "B008YAPQX4", "B004BR7XLM", "B009PN3OD8", "B003QO8TOQ", "B000HRMAPE", "B000VNMMR0", "B0000BYRO7", "B00AZFECL8", "B000EGDB10", "B004EPYZUS", "B0004Z33EQ", "B00AIBZMD6", "B009A87Z6U", "B009RO9LKK", "B000SK5Z70", "B00003CXMV", "6305657947", "B00005JLYW", "B00005JN2Z", "B00023B1LC", "B005PTYP70", "B00008G8M4", "B00005JNJV", "B00000G3PA", "B000P0J06K", "B002UZCJ8Y", "B002ZG9864", "0792844068", "B00005JKIP", "0792166736", "0790732238", "B00AS1Q93S", "B003Q6D2B4", "B0002I84N0", "B000U1ZV8K", "B008JFURII", "B00JA3RVG4", "B000MZHW40", "B00026ZG10", "0790732149", "B000FKO3HG", "B000AP04FG", "B008JFUS0U", "B0001FGC1U", "B00005JMQW", "B009L6UDUG", "B00AVWIQZS", "B0013BM63O", "B00005JLRT", "B00E5I2M6I", "B001TK80C0", "B00AZMFJYA", "B0007KZQAM", "B002ZG999U", "B00BUAEYVK", "B009A87ZQU", "B000P0J06U", "B008JFUO72", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B00003CY0V", "B00E5I2MCM", "B0036TGSR6", "B003AWRMBU", "B0000BYRO9", "B008JFUNHI", "B00177YA1K", "6304696221", "B0021L8V0M", "B00006G8FD", "B000UR9T8C", "B002GNOSFM", "B003UESJFQ", "B0006L0LOS", "B000AYELVU"], "bought_together": ["B000NIBURQ", "B000M53GM2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000M53GM2", "B000RPCK1U", "B000M53GN6", "B000RPCK0Q"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 38500}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.0, "brand": "MGM", "asin": "B00005JLBE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51kgPWMuVFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Die Another Day (Widescreen Special Edition)"}

{"description": "Outstanding picture and sound plus tons of features makeCharlie's Angels: Full Throttlea fully loaded DVD.  Don't expect more T&A; in the unrated edition, however.  The only difference is glimpses of more intense violence in a few of the fight scenes.  For example, in the theatrical version you'll see an angel flying through the air, but in the unrated version you'll then see her lying expressionless on the ground.  Also, blood flies out of Drew Barrymore's mouth in one scene.  On his commentary track, director McG discusses inside jokes, visual effects, and shots that didn't quite work for him.  Like a TV sportscaster, he uses a telestrator, but only to occasionally circle items of interest or draw arrows.  There's also an amusing commentary track by the three writers, who chuckle over inside jokes and discuss how the film was changed from the original script.  They preface their comments with: \"I guess they asked us to do this just to prove that writers worked on this movie.\"  \"Who are we kidding?  Who's listening to this right now?\"If you want still more info, there's a trivia track with pop-up factoids with occasional links to more featurettes, a jukebox that offers clips of 11 songs and explanations of why they were picked, a cameo-graphy that offers clips of 13 personalities and why we should know them, and eight 4- to 18-minute featurettes exploring such topics as stunts, vehicles, costumes, and the Pussycat Dolls dance troupe.  And in the next evolution of product placement, the DVD-ROM \"Shop the Scene\" feature allows you to search for a character's outfit or gadget then buy it online.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002A5EBMQ", "B00164EAGY", "B00003CXZ1", "B00AEFYGBA", "B000069HYG", "B0000SX9N2", "B00005JL8Z", "B00004ZDO9", "B008H6GHII", "B000UDGOC0", "B007AFC0RY", "B0006L0LOS", "B000085EFK", "B0007P0Y7C", "B00003CXMP", "B00024JC4E", "B00016MSV2", "B0007PLLBU", "B001C5LLQ4", "B00005MEVO", "B000BKJ758", "B000MX7V70", "B000035Z3G", "B002GHHHL0", "B000LC3ICE", "B000FDFSH2", "B0006GANPA", "B000Y11BC6", "B000AP04FG", "B00026ZG10", "B0041KKYGU", "B00005JMUA", "0767819640", "B0018PH3KQ", "B00008G7UI", "B00BLN4V0A", "B002GOAH1A", "B00006HAWN", "B0001BS3IE", "B0009RCPUW", "B002ZG984Q", "B001EDVNNU", "B000VI70QS", "B004LWZW2O", "B000A343RI", "B0006FO8E8", "B000EGDB10", "B000RW3VCU", "B00005JN4H", "B00BTYMPUY", "B00005J761", "B000CEXGAU", "B005TK0MFE", "B0041ONFOE", "B000VG66XS", "B00ID8H98C", "B00007AJF5", "B00AEFXO8Q", "B0009W5JR8", "B008JFURII", "B00001PE4D", "B000M7FOO8", "B004P7CN7W", "B0000DZ6N3", "B00005JM5B", "B00007GZRP", "B000ARXF96", "B0018CNNV2", "B000CCW2P2", "B0009KA2OA", "B002O3Z4ZW", "B00006G8JD", "B0008FXT1Y", "B0000524E5", "B002GSXKOW", "B00005JM55", "B003Q6D2B4", "B005CFBYW6", "B00008WJD6", "B000ENC5YW", "B003FCKI3O", "B005Z9MFRC", "B00004STVN", "B00005JG6N", "B00E1HIXEI", "B0007OCG56", "B00005JMEW", "B000BTIU4S", "B00008WJEZ", "B000NIBURQ", "B000EQ5V8G", "B0001Z37HM", "B003PIUINS", "B00005JMW7", "B00196UTEG", "B000A2IPQY", "B004SIP6VI", "B00005JLZW", "B00005JNTU", "B00AEFXCLU"], "bought_together": ["B002A5EBMQ", "B00AEFYGBA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002A5EBMQ", "B0000CABE5", "B000069HYG", "B008JFUUIA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 26650}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.9, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B00005JLYW", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51L5TYVcBmL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle (Unrated Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "There's only one deleted scene in this two-disc DVD set, but it's a doozy. The \"Sgt. Candy Scene\" is a must-see and, unfortunately, the best thing on the second disc. The rushed HBO documentary shows us far more flash than substance. Better is the Visual Effects Lab that goes more in-depth with four sequences, although you need to wade through a hokey interface for each segment. Making your \"own\" effects isn't that much fun; you can only choose a few effects that change in two scenes. Anyone looking to get the complicated backstory of the trilogy figured out should dig into the \"Sky Net Database\" and an intricate timeline. The two commentary tracks are worth a listen, with director Jonathan Mostow's solo track the better one. The director goes into great detail on how the little things (from lighting street scenes to tricks for destroying buildings) count.  The second track is pieced together from the actors recorded separately. Mostow appears with actress Claire Danes (doing her first commentary track) and their chemistry is enjoyable after a slow start. The other actors have less interesting things to say, including Schwarzenegger who is constantly--yet enthusiastically--selling the film.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001VLBDD0", "B00005N5S5", "B001FB55HQ", "B00005JA8B", "B00070FX5U", "B00007AJG4", "B002ZG98LO", "B000T9OP7G", "B002GHHHME", "B00005JKIP", "B002QFYJFY", "B0002J58HO", "B0000AXE8I", "B001AQO43M", "B00AKGG828", "B00026ZG10", "B0001BKAEY", "B00IZZDWKM", "B001451HXO", "B0000VCZK2", "B000056PMU", "B000BPL2FQ", "B000RW3VCK", "B0004Z33F0", "B000U1ZV8K", "B0045HCJGC", "B0004Z33EQ", "B00005JNTU", "B000HRMAPE", "B00008G8M4", "B000RRS7RE", "B00005JKYX", "B0000VD12I", "B000FC2FQA", "B00000ILDG", "B00000G3PA", "B00005JMZK", "B000MGBSE4", "B0087ZG7J8", "B0004Z33EG", "B000P0J0AQ", "B00005JMEW", "B0087ZG7NO", "B00003CXTA", "B0002CHK1S", "B000RJO56E", "B00177YA1K", "B00004STDN", "B005COLETU", "B001AK3S4Y", "B000VNMMR0", "B0000959N0", "B00005JMUA", "1558908846", "6305767866", "B001RIY4WE", "B0049IHX2C", "B000VI70QS", "B000EGDB10", "B002GSXKN8", "B00HZMZ2FE", "B0045HCJ9O", "B003QO8TOQ", "B00005JNJV", "B001451HX4", "B00I9TDMRM", "B0006GANOQ", "B00003CXSP", "6305428115", "B00016MSV2", "B00005JOC9", "B000TJBN80", "B009MO57H6", "B000O77SQS", "B0087ZG7HK", "B001OST0M6", "B005LAIHXQ", "B0002J4X1Q", "B0002V7OI8", "B0015XHP2C", "6304806434", "B000QXDED6", "B00005JL3K", "B008JFUPFI", "B003PIUINS", "0783225946", "0792839056", "B00005N7Z1", "B0006GAO6I", "B001DZOC6Y", "B00005JL78", "B001HN697M", "B00IJS2OXG", "B002NXSRVG", "B00008G8M5", "B00005JN0T", "B003XURDAY", "B000O77SRM", "B006VRRGNK", "B00F4FFO8E"], "bought_together": ["B001VLBDD0", "B00005N5S5"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001VLBDD0", "B00005N5S5", "B001FB55HQ", "B002JT6AO0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 115564}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 13.47, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00005JM0B", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5143TFPX8SL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "The Quiet Americanproves that elegant and intelligent filmmaking can be emotionally powerful. Michael Caine plays Thomas Fowler, a British journalist in 1950s Vietnam with a lovely Vietnamese mistress named Phuong  (Do Thi Hai Yen) and a jaded view of the political strife teeming around him. He befriends a seemingly innocuous American named Alden Pyle (Brendan Fraser), who falls in love with Phuong--and slowly, Pyle's real purpose in  Vietnam becomes revealed. Fowler finds that, to hold on to the carefully balanced life he's created for himself, he must make choices he's long avoided. Caine and Fraser are both superb and give a human face to complicated politics; as a result,The Quiet Americanmanages to be  compelling as both history and a story about very specific people embroiled in a very personal conflict.

{"description": "Director Patty Jenkins is prominent inMonster's two above-average 15-minute featurettes.  \"Based on a True Story: The Making ofMonster\" combines news broadcast; interviews with Jenkins, Charlize Theron, and others; a look at Theron's makeup; and signs of Aileen Wuornos's real-life world, including her best friend and the real Last Resort bar.  Jenkins and composer BT discuss the score in the other featurette, including how \"the score was conceived from the ground up in 5.1\" (the DVD's sound is all-enveloping) as well as the use of the hurdy-gurdy and the contribution of Journey's Steve Perry (even this featurette is in DTS). There's also a film-mixing demo, in which the viewer can add or subtract (but not change the levels of) the dialogue, sound effects, and music in a two-minute segment of the Funworld scene.

{"description": "There's a pretty good gimmick with these DVD extras aimed squarely at the pre-teen/early teen audience that ate up this film. Each of the extras (a standard making-of featurette, an alternate ending, and an interesting deleted scene) is followed by a clue afterwards. Decipher the clues and unlock the next set of extras: a nice bit on real treasure hunters, an awful piece on the Knights Templar, and one gem for kids: \"Riley Poole's Decode this!\" Actor Justin Bartha reprises his role (Nic Cage's techno-sidekick) and lectures a bit on the cooler side of language history and code-breaking with a few simple interactive games. If you get through it all, you unlock a hidden feature, a trivia track. Thankfully, those who do not want to go on the treasure hunt can access these features by reading the printed insert.

{"description": "Jamie Foxx's uncannily accurate performance isn't the only good thing aboutRay. Riding high on a wave of Oscar buzz, Foxx proved himself worthy of all the hype by portraying blind R&B; legend Ray Charles in a warts-and-all performance that Charles approved shortly before his death in June 2004. Despite a few dramatic embellishments of actual incidents (such as the suggestion that the accidental drowning of Charles's younger brother caused all the inner demons that Charles would battle into adulthood), the film does a remarkable job of summarizing Charles's strengths as a musical innovator and his weaknesses as a philandering heroin addict who recorded some of his best songs while flying high as a kite. Foxx seems to be channeling Charles himself, and as he did with the life of Ritchie Valens in La Bamba, director Taylor Hackford gets most of the period details absolutely right as he chronicles Ray's rise from \"chitlin circuit\" performer in the early '50s to his much-deserved elevation to legendary status as one of the all-time great musicians. Foxx expertly lip-syncs to Ray Charles' classic recordings, but you could swear he's the real deal in a film that honors Ray Charles without sanitizing his once-messy life.--Jeff ShannonMore on Ray CharlesModern Sounds in Country and Western Music(CD)The Genius of Ray Charles(CD)Ray Charles and Betty Carter--Dedicated to You(CD)Genius & Soul--The 50th Anniversary Collection(CD)Ray: A Tribute to the Movie, the Music, and the Man(book)More Albums by Ray Charles", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000E8QVWY", "B001P3SA94", "B00465I1CE", "B00005JKMQ", "6305428409", "B003BV8I3Q", "B00AEFXTKO", "B0002LE9HC", "B000BOH8X2", "B00AEFYG3S", "0790739313", "B000JJSL1W", "B000A50460", "B00005TQ44", "0783230524", "B0009R1TJ0", "0780627822", "B00AEFZ63M", "B000P0J092", "B002VWNICM", "B00EV4EUT8", "B000JLTRH2", "B000N6U0E2", "B0041QSZS8", "0783237367", "078324228X", "B00AEFY6TW", "B003HKN534", "B00BTYPWDQ", "B00G4Q3KOC", "B00007AJG1", "B00007L4KF", "B00ANDDBBY", "B000BITV9W", "0783114907", "B00007AJG2", "1558908390", "B00005JLRZ", "B000FVQLQQ", "6305692572", "0767821637", "B002CA68NO", "B00AFEXRME", "B002CPMB9O", "B004SIP93S", "B000063JDI", "B00005NB8K", "B00125WAWS", "6305505780", "B000IFRT4W", "B001TUZGPO", "B009NNM9OA", "B000RB6XG2", "B000P0J0CY", "B0001FR3IQ", "B000FVQLRA", "B00066FAVW", "B002XMGGK6", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00DW5IL2E", "B00005JPK8", "0767811070", "B000I0QL7I", "B000069I0E", "B00080ZG10", "0306814315", "B000P0J0EM", "B00AEFXP8K", "B00049QQHI", "B00000JGHV", "B0007CEXYK", "B0001Q4BOE", "B0000YEE6M", "B000NIVJF4", "B008Y1YJN6", "B00066VTU8", "B001132GNY", "B0006QAIG4", "B0034G4OSG", "B000C20VRS", "0800141741", "B00A2H9QN8", "B000Y11B8K", "B00005LB86", "B000056VP4", "B00005JL72", "B000095J01", "B000Q7ZNZ4", "B002CAWNEM", "B003UESJHO", "B00066FAQW", "0783230389", "B0013FDM7E", "B00007ELEO", "B00AMEZDJW", "B000P0J0CE", "B003Y5H4ZC", "0767821955", "B00003GPFT", "B0021L8V2A"], "bought_together": ["B000E8QVWY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0002LE9HC", "B000E8QVWY", "B000BOH8X2", "B00AZMFJYA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 17277}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.89, "brand": "Universal Studios", "asin": "B00005JND5", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41RQ8ETK19L._SX300_.jpg", "title": "Ray (Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "Opposites are forced to attract inAlong Came Polly, a dose of featherweight fluff that could've been better and could've been worse--surely no pairing of Ben Stiller and Jennifer Aniston can be a complete waste of time, right? Faint praise indeed, but fans of these mainstream funny-folk will enjoy this movie as a lazy-weekend distraction. Ben's a newlywed insurance risk-assessment analyst whose wife (Debra Messing, in a throwaway role) betrays him on their honeymoon. His uptight, play-it-safe lifestyle (which includes acute aversion to germs and irritable bowel syndrome) makes him seemingly incompatible with the spontaneous, free-spirited Polly (Aniston), but writer-director John Hamburg (whose writing credits include the previous Stiller hitsMeet the ParentsandZoolander) is determined to give them at least theappearanceof romantic potential.

{"description": "With the slimmest extras package for a Pixar film debuting on DVD,Carsstill shines for home viewing. As with earlier digital-to-digital transfers, the film sounds and looks stunning. There is only one behind-the-scenes feature, a 16-minute cursory but entertaining glance at director John Lasseter's influences (his dad was a car-parts manager), including some of the real-life inspiration for the film such as Michael Wallis's influential book on Route 66 (he also voiced the sheriff). There's a new cartoon for the DVD, \"Mater and Ghost Light,\" which is smile-inducing at best. Four deleted scenes (in storybook format with voices) also show a darker tone the movie may have taken at one point. Best is the adorable short \"One Man Band\" that showed theatrically with the film, and the film's credit sequence can be seen full screen without the credits (and find the Easter egg for an extended version).

{"description": "Movies don't come any bigger than Peter Jackson'sKing Kong, a three-hour remake of the 1933 classic that marries breathtaking visual prowess with a surprising emotional depth. Expanding on the original story of the blonde beauty and the beast who falls for her, Jackson creates a movie spectacle that matches hisLord of the Ringsfilms and even at times evokes their fantasy world while celebrating the glory of '30s Hollywood. Naomi Watts stars as Ann Darrow, a vaudeville actress down on her luck in Depression-era New York until manic filmmaker Carl Denham (a game but miscast Jack Black) entices her with a lead role. Dazzled by the genius of screenwriter Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody), Ann boards the tramp steamer S.S.Venture, which she--and most of the wary crew--believes is headed for Singapore. Denham, however, is in search of the mythic Skull Island, hoping to capture its wonders on film and make a fortune. What he didn't count on were some scary natives who find that the comely Darrow looks like prime sacrifice material for a mysterious giant creature....There's no point in rehashing the entire plot, as every movie aficionado is more than familiar with the trajectory ofKing Kong; the challenge facing Jackson, his screenwriters, and the phenomenal visual-effects team was to breathe new life into an old, familiar story. To that degree, they achieve what could be best called a qualified success. Though they've assembled a crackerjack supporting cast, including Thomas Kretschmann as theVenture's hard-bitten captain and young Jamie Bell as a plucky crewman, the first third of the movie is rather labored, with too much minute detail given over to sumptuous re-creations of '30s New York and the unexciting initial leg of theVenture's sea voyage. However, once the film finds its way to Skull Island (which bears more than a passing resemblance toLOTR's Mordor),Kongturns into a dazzling movie triumph, by turns terrifying and awe-inspiring. The choreography and execution of the action set pieces--including one involving Kong and a trio of Tyrannosaurus Rexes, as well as another that could be charitably described as a bug-phobic's nightmare--is nothing short of landmark filmmaking, and a certain Mr. Spielberg should watch his back, asKongtrumps most anything that has come before it.Despite the visual challenges ofKing Kong, the movie's most difficult hurdle is the budding romance between Ann and her simian soulmate. Happily, this is where Jackson unqualifiedly triumphs, as this unorthodox love story is tenderly and humorously drawn, by turns sympathetic and wondrous. Watts, whose accessibility balances out her almost otherworldly loveliness, works wonders with mere glances, and Andy Serkis, who digitally embodies Kong here much as he did Gollum in theLOTRfilms, breathes vibrant life into the giant star of the film without ever overplaying any emotions. The final, tragic act of the film, set mostly atop the Empire State Building, is whereKongearns its place in movie history as a work that celebrates both the technical and emotional heights that film can reach.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"bought_together": ["B000EHQTZO", "B00AEFYEU8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000EHQTZO", "B00AEFYEU8", "B0087ZG7HK", "0767817478"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 32487}, "categories": [["Movies & TV"]], "price": 8.94, "brand": "Universal Studios", "asin": "B00005JO20", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/513Y54TGdwL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "King Kong (Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "Critics and controversy aside,The Da Vinci Codeis a verifiable blockbuster. Combine the film's huge worldwide box-office take with over 100 million copies of Dan Brown's book sold, andThe Da Vinci Codehas clearly made the leap from pop-culture hit to a certifiable franchise. The leap for any story making the move from book to big screen, however, is always more perilous. In the case ofThe Da Vinci Code, the plot is concocted of such a preposterous formula of elements that you wouldn&#x92;t envy screenwriter Akiva Goldsman, the man tasked with making this story filmable. The script followsDan Brown&#x92;s bookas closely as possible while incorporating a few needed changes, including a better ending. And if you&#x92;re like most of the world, by now you&#x92;ve read the book and know how it goes: while lecturing in Paris, noted Harvard Professor of Symbology Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) is summoned to the Louvre by French police to help decipher a bizarre series of clues left at the scene of the murder of the chief curator. Enter Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou), gifted cryptologist. Neveu and Langdon team up to solve the mystery, and from there the story is propelled across Europe, ballooning into a modern-day mini-quest for the Holy Grail, where secret societies are discovered, codes are broken, and murderous albino monks are thwarted&#x85; oh, and alternative theories about the life of Christ and the beginnings of Christianity are presented too, of course. It&#x92;s not the typical formula for a stock Hollywood thriller. In fact, taken solely as a mystery, the movie almost works--despite some gaping holes--mostly just because it keeps moving. Brown&#x92;s greatest trick was  to have the entire story take place in one day, so the action is forced to keep moving, despite some necessary pauses for exposition. As a screen couple, Hanks and Tautou are just fine together but not exactly memorable; meanwhile Sir Ian McKellen&#x92;s scenery-chewing as pivotal character Sir Leigh Teabing is just what the film needed to keep it from taking itself too seriously. The whole thing is like a good roller-coaster ride: try not to think too much about it--just sit back and enjoy the trip.--Daniel VanciniVisit The Da Vinci Code StoreOn The DVDThe DVD extras on a film as popular asThe Da Vinci Codeshould be plentiful, and this version doesn&#x92;t skimp. With over 90 minutes of special features, including ten behind-the-scenes featurettes, there&#x92;s a lot here to explore beyond the film itself. The question is, is there anything new here that we haven&#x92;t heard before, in all the hype, pseudo-documentaries, and controversy surrounding the movie, to make it worthwhile?  For most viewers, the answer will be \"yes.\" Essentially, if you like the movie, if you enjoyed the book, you will get a lot out of them.Just as the movie is intended to make the book come to life, the DVD extras should make the film come to life by pointing the audience into the world of the filmmakers, connecting the dots between print and film, and for the most part they do just that. The extras here range from the typical look behind-the-scenes to more in-depth features on the supporting characters, the locations, and theMona Lisaherself.  \"First Day on the Set with Ron Howard\" features the director gushing about the opportunity to film in the Louvre and work with Tom Hanks again (the two worked together before onSplashandApollo 13). It&#x92;s a short piece that doesn&#x92;t reveal much beyond making an attempt to share Howard&#x92;s excitement (with the \"Gee, I really loved working with him/her on this project\" that you hear in every such featurette), but viewers might enjoy seeing how the stage was set up in the famous museum, down to the spike tape on the floor showing actors where to hit their marks.The Filmmaking Experience, Parts 1 and 2further explores the creative and technical aspects of the filmmaking process.A Conversation with Dan Brownstarts out feeling like a puff-piece (the man who wrote this book got started at age 5 with a story calledThe Giraffe, The Pig, and the Pants on Fire. \"It was a thriller,\" he says.) and unfortunately it doesn&#x92;t go very deep into much of anything of interest. But on the other hand, this isn&#x92;t60 Minuteshere; it&#x92;s intended to give viewers a better sense of the man behind the franchise, which it does.  Much of the footage from this interview is sprinkled throughout some of the other featurettes. Meanwhile, the character behind the franchise, Robert Langdon, is examined in his own featurette, as is Sophie Neveu. The cool thing here is getting under the skin of the actors to see how they approached the characters, knowing that most of the movie-going public already has formed their own ideas about the characters from the book.The most interesting extras are the featurettes that focus on the history behind the mystery. Or is it the mystery behind the history?  Either way, the first one on theMona Lisa, and the second featurette on the many codes and symbols that are hidden throughout the movie balance out the remainder of the extras nicely by demonstrating the sense of intrigue, mystery, and game-playing adventure that madeThe Da Vinci Codeso popular in the first place.--Daniel VanciniBeyondThe Da Vinci CodeThe Films of Tom HanksThe Films of Ron HowardThe Da Vinci DVDs: Decoding \"The Da Vinci Code\"More About The ArtistStills fromThe Da Vinci Code(click for larger image)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002O5M4T4", "B00005JN5E", "B0013BM63O", "B002ZTQVKM", "B0007XG02W", "B001OLP2TI", "B002C68WNW", "0307474275", "B002O5M4SU", "B00005JLSB", "B000PHVZNE", "B0077ATSSQ", "B00AEFY0F2", "B000EPR7NE", "0743486226", "B001LMAK9W", "B000P0J0EW", "0385504209", "B005HWAOP2", "B001OQCV2E", "B0013XZ2QK", "B001EZE5D8", "B00005JL3T", "B000EOTW0Q", "6304711891", "B000YDBPAM", "0307950689", "B000HT386M", "B00008G8M4", "B000P0J0EM", "B002ZG99KO", "0800141806", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B00001ZWUS", "B0002V7OI8", "B002O3Z50Q", "B0006GANOQ", "B002NZK5UU", "B000NQRR1Q", "0385504225", "B004SIP7ZS", "B00005Y71F", "B000OYC7BW", "B00DL48BM6", "B00026ZG10", "B0018CWW5K", "B00004BZIY", "B0000B1OFL", "B00023B1LC", "B000N6U0E2", "B00A8MGIZG", "B00005JM5E", "B002LMV7R0", "B00004Z4WR", "B000K2UGXO", "B00005JMYC", "B001MVYUQG", "B00005JLWN", "B000056PMU", "B0000AOV4I", "B00AEFY4CG", "B00441GYXS", "B001F12J0C", "B00ES28X3C", "B002ZG980U", "B001VLBDD0", "B00008K76U", "B001TK80C0", "B008JFURII", "B000VWYJ86", "0792159659", "B00AEFYGBA", "B0009MDPYM", "B00177YA1K", "B00005N5S5", "B0043X1FM2", "B0002J58HO", "B00005JM5B", "B00AZMFJYA", "B003AWRMBA", "074349346X", "B003VA3JUO", "0783240295", "6305767866", "B0000844I8", "B000065U1N", "B002GHHHKQ", "B000K7VHQE", "B0000AXE8I", "0800177258", "B000ASDFGI", "B003Q6D2B4", "B000HRMAPE", "B000U7WV1Y", "B00005JMOW", "B00GPWEPZ8", "0312944926", "B000VI70QS", "B000KF0GWW"], "bought_together": ["B002O5M4T4", "B00005JN5E"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002O5M4T4", "B00I563DSC", "B0013BM63O", "1400079152"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 7555}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.5, "brand": "DaVinci", "asin": "B00005JOC9", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51SLBDLMtIL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Da Vinci Code (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition)"}

{"description": "InCry_Wolf, a group of students at a snooty prep school conjure a serial killer when someone takes a hoax a little too seriously. Owen (Julian Morris,Whirlygirl), who's just transferred to Westlake Academy, quickly becomes enamored of Dodger (Lindy Booth,Wrong Turn), a smart and sultry redhead who masterminds a game based on lying and manipulating the other players. After a murder in the nearby woods, Owen escalates the game by concocting a hoax about a serial killer called the Wolf--a hoax that swiftly turns into reality when the not-so-imaginary Wolf sends threatening e-mails to Owen.Cry_Wolfmixes your standard slasher movie with your standard secret-twist movie to no particularly effect. The Wolf--who wears an orange ski-mask and wields a hunting knife--is a generic boogeyman; text messages just aren't scary; and all the characters combined couldn't muster up an engaging personality. This movie was obviously made to fit a market niche, not because a writer or director had any genuine inspiration or had to exorcise a personal fear--but even for a b-movie this is meager stuff.

{"description": "Helen Mirren reigns supreme inThe Queen, a witty and ingenious look at a moment that rocked the house of Windsor:  the week that followed the sudden death of Princess Diana in 1997. Diana's death came at just the same time that Prime Minister Tony Blair (played by the bright Michael Sheen) was settling into his new government--and trying to figure out the delicate relationship between 10 Downing Street and Queen Elizabeth II (Mirren). A large portion of the British population was trying to figure out the Windsors that week, as Elizabeth remained stiff-upper-lip and largely mum about the death of the beloved princess. In Peter Morgan's skillful script, we watch as Blair grows increasingly impatient with the Royals, who are sequestered in their Scottish estate while the public demands some show of grief. Prince Philip (James Cromwell, in good form) clumsily decides to take Diana's sons hunting, while a sympathetically-treated Prince Charles (Alex Jennings) displays some frustration with his mother's eerie calm.None of this conveys how funny the film is, or how deftly it flows from one scene to the next. Director Stephen Frears (Dirty Pretty Things) deserves great credit for that, and for the performances, and for the movie's marvelous sense of well-roundedness; you could see this movie and groan at the cluelessness of the Royals and their outmoded existence, or you might just sympathize with showing reserve in a world that values gross public displays of emotion. But either way, you'll marvel at Mirren, who makes the Queen far more alert and human than one might ever have imagined.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B003UESJH4", "B001C4AFOY", "B004M9QNVK", "B004GXKBDI", "B0059XTUVI", "B000Z8H0IC", "B000ZOXDFA", "B000RF7XYO", "B001L57ZZG", "B001TH92N4", "B000BKDNX0", "B0006Q93H4", "B000EOTELI", "B004XYOQU4", "B009TT0BSE", "B0012QE4Q2", "B001QUF3SW", "B007HW8U2Y", "B000EHQUGC", "B00342ANSA", "B004SIP9U6", "B000V02CNW", "B00005O7N8", "B00GM7STPI", "B003N9ASF2", "B002ZG99EK", "B004SIP71M", "B003Y5H4Y8", "B0001I55M4", "B001AZIRVI", "B00015HXDG", "B000E1NXJ0", "B000RF7XYY", "B00121QGPY", "B009AMANBA", "B000M06KJ8", "B000MEYJHY", "B00005JOFQ", "B007TBJUVI", "B0085A9JXG", "B003AND1SM", "B000NIVJF4", "B0010X73Z6", "B000K7VHQE", "B00005JKNF", "B000MCH5P4", "B001TR4G6W", "B004P7CNZO", "B0050PYNN0", "B000GH3CR0", "B00AEFY8MM", "B0068MNO4S", "B002RSDW80", "B001MVWFAO", "B004ZNFTDQ", "B000255LIY", "B000V6LSOA", "B00ARX2VZW", "B000G6BM0K", "B008220C38"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003UESJH4", "B004M9QNVK", "B001C4AFOY", "B004GXKBDI"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "asin": "B00005JPAM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51K34G0GCBL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Queen"}
{"description": "More exciting than The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe,The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspiancontinues the movie franchise based on C.S. Lewis' classic fantasy books. The movie picks up where the first left off... sort of. It's been a year since the Pevensie children--Peter (William Moseley), Susan (Anna Popplewell), Edmund (Skandar Keynes), and Lucy (Georgie Henley)--returned to England from Narnia, and they've just about resigned themselves to living their ordinary lives. But just like that, they're once again transported to a fantastical land, but one with a long-abandoned castle. It turns out that they are in Narnia again--and they themselves lived in that castle, but hundreds of years ago in Narnia time. They've been summoned back to help Prince Caspian (Stardust's Ben Barnes, resembling a young, cultured Keanu Reeves), the rightful heir to the throne who's become the target of his power-hungry uncle, King Mraz (Sergio Castellitto). And he's not the only one threatened: Mraz's people, the Telmarines, have pushed all the Narnians--the talking animals, the centaurs and other beasts, the walking trees--to the brink of extinction. Despite some alpha-male bickering, Peter and Caspian agree to fight Mraz alongside the remaining Narnians, including the dwarf Trumpkin (Peter Dinklage) and the swashbuckling mouse Reepicheep (voiced by Eddie Izzard). (Also appearing is Warwick Davis, who was in Willow and the 1989 BBC Prince Caspian.) But of course they most of all miss the noble lion, Aslan, who would have never let this happen to Narnia if he hadn't disappeared. Prince Caspian is epic, evoking memories of Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings films. (Some of the battle elements may seem too familiar, but they were in Lewis's book.)

{"description": "Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's Endis a rollicking voyage in the same spirit of the two earlierPiratesfilms, yet far darker in spots (and nearly three hours to boot). The action, largely revolving around a pirate alliance against the ruthless East India Trading Company, doesn't disappoint, though the violence is probably too harsh for young children. Through it all, the plucky cast (Keira Knightley, Orlando Bloom, Geoffrey Rush) are buffeted by battle, maelstroms, betrayal, treachery, a ferocious Caribbean weather goddess, and that gnarly voyage back from the world's end--but with their wit intact. As always, Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow tosses off great lines ; he chastises \"a woman scorned, like which hell hath no fury than!\" He insults an opponent with a string of epithets, ending in \"yeasty codpiece.\"!In the previousThe Curse of the Black Pearl, Sparrow was killed--sent to Davy Jones' Locker. In the opening scenes, the viewer sees that death has  not been kind to Sparrow--but that's not to say he hasn't found endless ways to amuse himself, cavorting with dozens of hallucinated versions of himself on the deck of the Black Pearl. But Sparrow is needed in this world, so a daring rescue brings him back. Keith Richards' much ballyhooed appearance as Jack's dad is little more than a cameo, though he does play a wistful guitar. But the action, as always, is more than satisfying, held together by Depp, who, outsmarting the far-better-armed British yet again, causes a bewigged commander to muse: \"Do you think he plans it all out, or just makes it up as he goes along?\" As far as fans are concerned, it matters not.--A.T. HurleyOn the DVDHere's something you can't say about just any DVD extras: There appears to bemoreof Keith Richards in the outtakes, interviews, and other special features on theAt World's Enddisc than in the actual film. For those scenes alone, this special edition is well worth the price. Richards looks as woozy and gamey as all the rumors suggested, and answers questions he's not asked, with Johnny Depp sitting next to him, almost acting as a translator. Richards offers pithy comments like, \"Everything I do is original, you better believe,\" and smiles when other cast members call him \"Two-Take Richards\" for supposedly nailing his scenes.The packed second disc also includes a terrific mini-doc on how the filmmakers created the famous maelstrom, in an enormous hanger in Palmdale, California, with the ships floating 30 feet off the ground. \"Just moving theBlack Pearlwas an enormous undertaking,\" says producer Jerry Bruckheimer with serious understatement. Other cool extras include \"Tale of the Many Jacks,\" deleted scenes with great commentary, \"The World of Chow Yun-Fat,\" a bio of composer Hans Zimmer, features on the set designers, a look at the impressive Brethren Court, and some hilarious bloopers. \"You can't curse in a Disney film,\" deadpans Depp when a costar blurts out something blue. \"See? I told him.\" The extras are truly as much of a rollicking adventure as the film.--A.T.

{"description": "Edith Piaf is the subject ofLa Vie en Rose, director Olivier Dahan's powerful if emotionally redundant biographical film about the iconic French superstar whose life, as depicted here, seems to have been a numbing succession of tragedies interrupted on occasion by artistic triumph. Dahan's portrait begins with Piaf's stay in a brothel as a young girl. Left to the care of her grandmother (who runs the place) after her father pulls her away from a narcissistic mother, Piaf undergoes significant health problems and grows up to sing on the street in lieu of outright prostitution. The film pulses along with the usual biopic rhythms, with pivotal moments in the life of Piaf (played as an adult by Marion Cotillard) turning up regularly only to be smacked aside by the unseen hand of perpetual misfortune. There's the impresario (Gerard Depardieu) who recognizes Piaf's great but raw talent only to have a run-in with the criminal element around her. There's the heavyweight fighter (Marcel Cerdan) who becomes the love of Piaf's life but can't be with her. Drug addiction, random car accidents, tax problems, you name it, it's all here, topped by an unnerving revelation that pops up inLa Vie en Rose's final moments. After awhile, with such a concentration of bad news squeezed into 140 minutes, one begins to wish Dahan had taken a more expansive approach to Piaf's life and times. But the film is never less than interesting, and the lead performance by Cotillard is often astonishing.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002LE8MGW", "B004SEUIXS", "B000UVV26A", "B001CIOCLC", "B000002UYD", "B002VKB0M4", "B000YPUFBA", "B002AG2NTI", "B0007Z0NYQ", "B0087IT8FK", "B000MEYIBG", "B0009P7EI2", "B004WDZR0O", "B00279MJHE", "0307268012", "B0069UV0AY", "B001THZAAI", "B005MYEQ4U", "B000002TMF", "B000LXH10I", "B00421IR5I", "B0000C9JFO", "B007I1Q59E", "B00AZNEVNE", "B000I6BJ56", "B000811672", "B00007J5VT", "B008H1Q3QY", "B0002S64SM", "B003L20III", "B00782O7IY", "1613743920", "B005V4X8PO", "B0007A61K6", "B0030MD5TS", "B0019UGYAU", "B0000YEENU", "B0084O26SI", "B004B3254Q", "B0001Y4JO8", "B004ZBFRRG", "B006KDHJMS", "B00A92MEJY", "B000UAE7MM", "B009CSVQ8Q", "B000SAAT76", "B00008979K", "B000CSUNRU", "B000YAA68W", "B004SIP6BI", "B0041KKYF6", "B002QQ8HAG", "B00005JM48", "B00007L4I6", "B000934FC2", "B005CKW8BM", "B004YCKKIM", "B002ONC9NC", "B001AZJKKK", "B0012EI8ES", "B009B8YMB0", "B000053VBN", "B0002V7TI8", "B004UXUUDA", "B008CJ0JS4", "B001DZA3W6", "B0031REQKE", "B000LXHK2C", "B005HISOJ4", "B000B58DHQ", "B000296E7W", "0792833279", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B005CU5OF4", "B0000A1HQP", "B00ENMZK1A", "B00166UFTS", "B000053VBP", "B00CDV4PPK", "B00005AUK9", "B004XVMCMG", "B00005NC66", "B00008G7UF", "B0031SU2Y2", "B00000AVEO", "B000M06KJ8", "B00ANQHR7U", "B004NWPY3E", "B001C71IEM", "B006OB3JVQ", "B00G15MDI0", "B001KVZ6AM", "B0036TGSJE", "B001O549EI", "B0045NXMJE", "B000SSQ7JC", "B004ZG5EYC", "B00000K3TS"], "bought_together": ["B002LE8MGW", "B001CIOCLC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005MYEQ4U", "B002LE8MGW", "B004SEUIXS", "B000UVV26A"]}, "price": 11.14, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 9014}, "asin": "B00005JPX8", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ylggkac7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "La Vie en Rose (Extended Version)"}
{"description": "Leonardo DiCaprio puts a handsome face on an ugly industry: In parts of Africa, diamond mining fuels civil warfare, killing thousands of innocents and drafting preteen children as vicious soldiers. DiCaprio (The Departed) plays Danny Archer, a white African soldier-turned-diamond-smuggler who gets wind of a large raw jewel found by Solomon Vandy, a native fisherman (Djimon Hounsou,In America) recently escaped from enslavement by a brutal rebel leader. Archer offers a deal: He'll help Vandy find his war-scattered family if Vandy will share the diamond with him. Drawn into this web of exploitation is journalist Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly,Little Children), who agrees to help if Archer will tell her the details of how conflict diamonds make their way into the hands of the corporations who sell them to the Western world. DiCaprio is compelling because he never flinches from Archer's utter ruthlessness; Archer ends up doing the morally justifiable thing, but only because his desperate greed has led him to it. Hounsou and Connelly, though saddled with all the moral and political speeches, rise above the cant and keep the movie's treacherously formulaic plot rooted in human characters. But in the end, the story won't stick with you as much as the dead stillness in the child soldiers' eyes; the horror of African civil strife refuses to be contained byBlood Diamond's uplifting message--and the movie is all the more potent as a result.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001N44BVQ", "B000M341QE", "B00005JLSB", "B00AEBB8NI", "B00080ZG10", "B004SIP7TE", "B006OFN0SE", "B002ZG980U", "B000NIVJF4", "B0007R4T3U", "B0016Q2D66", "B00049QQHI", "B001EZE5DI", "B00003CWM3", "B00008DP4C", "6305268827", "B000BYA5G4", "B00AEBB9F0", "B000Y7WGOW", "B004SIP7ZS", "B000065U1N", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B000095WW8", "B000U7169M", "B00DHHWXYY", "B000GFLKF8", "B004SIP8ZM", "B002O3Z510", "B002VWNIEA", "B002ZG99N6", "B0007DFJ0G", "B005LAIIJY", "0792839137", "B000KP62SE", "B000P0J0EW", "B000P0J09M", "B007SPPANM", "B00004XPPG", "B000C20VPA", "B00011CZRE", "B002QEHPQU", "B00005JN2Z", "B00AEBB9CS", "B00003CXWV", "B00AEFY5B6", "B00001ZWUS", "B00H9KKGTO", "B00005JN0W", "B002T9H2LA", "B000MTEFXC", "B003L20IG0", "B00AEBB86A", "B00005JKBC", "B0013XZ2QK", "B0000ACOXL", "B005LAIGRS", "B002AT8K9W", "B0007KIFGE", "B00AZNEW5G", "B003ASLJO0", "B000T28PII", "B002DU39GW", "B002ZG97RE", "B000LC55F2", "B00003CXTG", "B00AEBBA36", "B00B0U2SFE", "B003ASLJQI", "B002CPMB9O", "B00BB67UNW", "B000MXPE7O", "0783231202", "B000FVQLQQ", "B00AEFXVCU", "B00AEFXRRO", "B000A3XY5A", "B002JCSWV6", "B00005JNQA", "B004EPYZP8", "B0050MB4OO", "B000P0J0AG", "B000C65Z1G", "B00275EGWY", "B00005B6JZ", "B0006GANPA", "B00AEBB9NM", "B002XMGGK6", "B000C20VRS", "B0007P0XBO", "B003UESJME", "B000QXDED6", "B00AHTYI5M", "B001P9KR8U", "B004A8ZX28", "B008JFUNKU", "B003ASLJQS", "B002VWNICC", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00005BCKF", "B000NOIX48"], "bought_together": ["B000M341QE", "B002ZG980U"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AEBB8NI", "B00H9KKGTO", "B008MILL8W", "B000BYA5G4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 106777}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.96, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00005JPGO", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61MN8-6skUL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Blood Diamond (Two-Disc Special Edition)"}
{"description": "The supplemental features onTMNTare a decidedly mixed bag: Viewers are offered a great deal of extras, but all run far too short to prove particularly useful to serious Turtle fans. The deleted and extended scenes will undoubtedly be the chief feature of interest, but the alternate opening and ending, as well as several other clips are presented only in early test form (\"Roof Top Workout\" is presented in storyboard form and then in pre-visualized form). Also, one cannot view the deleted/extended scenes without hearing commentary by director Kevin Munroe (who also provides an informative if somewhat dry feature-length commentary track). Having said that, some of these scenes (most notably \"Splinter Gets Cake\") do stand on their own, and might have helped to enliven the theatrical version of the finished film. Also included is a brief featurette comprised of interviews with the voice talent cast, and \"Donny's Digital Data Files\" explores the CGI design for the characters and their environment; again, their brief running times (the info-heavy \"Donny\" clocks in at less than two minutes) will render them somewhat extraneous to hardcore Turtles devotees. The Internet Reel is a promotional collection of clips from the film, while trailers for several other kid-friendly Warner Bros. and Hanna-Barbera films and DVD collections (Fred Claus,The Last Mimzy,Birdman and The Galaxy Trio) round out the sorta-special features.--Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000696I1", "B0000696I0", "6304698739", "B00AEVXGFG", "B0001FVDG4", "B003Q7B742", "B00CD45J9S", "B0007NFMCG", "B00DTRR3XS", "B00H7BJ1XC", "B000EHSVG4", "B000BQ7J9I", "B0087AOYCU", "B003PIUIJ2", "B00L4K450G", "B0081DECO8", "B00DY09BE4", "630016411X", "0307980715", "B0000VV3U0", "B000G1R39Y", "B008BM2LJ2", "B00DWXV074", "0449817652", "B005335K7W", "B0030E5PYY", "B000S6LP50", "B00DHUV1US", "B008DBZBUC", "B008DBZBS4", "B002D755BW", "B0000AGWP0", "B00DO2J8CC", "B00BT289I8", "B000M2E3FO", "B008132JES", "B001U7NVZ8", "B00F4MB1OI", "0307980707", "B008O6Q7D6", "B008DBZBV6", "B000MRAZ3I", "B00GO9GXUC", "B008DBZC9W", "B008O6Q8H6", "B00DJY7MD2", "B00AEFZ06A", "B00DV5ZE2U", "B00CUB6OIE", "B008DBZC8I", "B00DM2LGVU", "B00AEFY8FO", "B001ECQ75A", "1450819729", "B008DBZC8S", "B00CBZU3M2", "B0096EG2P8", "B004DOTKDM", "B0089BSOGO", "B00ENR17TY", "B002WJI2QQ", "B00CBOU3QO", "B000065V42", "B004GJYROG", "B00BESSXPG", "B00A8HOYQQ", "B00BG34F0G", "B00DWXV1DM", "B00A88DQWI", "B008O6Q7TK", "0449818268", "B00006FDN0", "B000CEXFZG", "B00DWXV07E", "B00B5A1GPM", "B0081N08X2", "B000M4H6RE", "B00ITAQ2MS", "B00CMDPTUY", "B00CUB6TZM", "B00DWI7JVK", "B00DSB5RU6", "B00DWI8SDI", "B00I6JOD2S", "B00GD9GNEY", "B00AEFZ6V4", "B0000AYK1R", "B000FZETRU", "B00CC6URB2", "B00AEFY5TI", "B00AEFXMSS", "B00B76ZWX6", "B00CUB6TVQ", "B000BITUVG", "B008DBZC92", "0767839277", "B008DBZC88"], "bought_together": ["6304698739", "B0000696I0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003PIUIJ2", "B0000VV3U0", "6304698739", "B0001FVDG4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 14368}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.84, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00005JPMZ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51iO8U9tnZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "TMNT"}

{"description": "One of the first things a viewer notices aboutCloverfieldis that it doesn't play by ordinary storytelling rules, making this intriguing horror film as much a novelty as an event. Told from the vertiginous point-of-view of a camcorder-wielding group of friends,Cloverfieldbegins like a primetime television soap opera about young Manhattanites coping with changes in their personal lives. Rob (Michael Stahl-David) is leaving New York to take an executive job at a company in Japan. At his goodbye party in a crowded loft, Rob&#x92;s brother Jason (Mike Vogel) hands a camcorder to best friend Hud (T.J. Miller), who proceeds to tape the proceedings over old footage of Rob&#x92;s ex-girlfriend, Beth (Odette Yustman)--images shot during happy times in that now-defunct relationship. Naturally, Beth shows up at the party with a new beau, bumming Rob out completely. Just before one's eyes glaze over from all this heartbreaking stuff (captured by Hud, who's something of a doofus, in laughably shaky camerawork), the unexpected happens: New York is suddenly under attack from a Godzilla-like monster stomping through midtown and destroying everything and everybody in sight. Rob and company hit the streets, but rather than run with other evacuees, they head toward the center of the storm so that Rob can rescue an injured Beth. There are casualties along the way, but the journey into fear is fascinating and immediate if emotionally remote--a consequence of seeing these proceedings through the singular, subjective perspective of a camcorder and of a story that intentionally leaves major questions unanswered: Who or what is this monster? Where did it come from? The lack of a backstory, and spare views of the marauding creature, are clever ways by producer J.J. Abrams and director Matt Reeves to keep an audience focused exclusively on what&#x92;s on the screen.  But it also makesCloverfieldcuriously uninvolving. Ultimately,Cloverfield, with its spectacular effects brilliantly woven into a home-video look, is a celebration of infinite possibilities in this age of accessible, digital media.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B004EPYZQ2", "B00IO9D3ZI", "B00EMMDMKM", "B002SJIO5E", "B0044ZOI32", "B001AR0D4A", "B004BZ5AMS", "B001MVYUQQ", "B003BJO8KU", "B0018AG6X6", "B005LAIGPU", "B00IO8VMB6", "B000PKG8SS", "B003Y5H5GU", "B00BPA2PGG", "B0017U7PT6", "B001YV502C", "B0013FBS20", "B008JFUR10", "B001KZVQJI", "B001CW7ZW6", "B0035WTJFW", "B000Y7U98W", "B003ABZGRI", "B000VDDWEC", "B000VDDWEM", "B002JT69IM", "B00164EAC8", "B002ZG981E", "B00AEFXORM", "B001DZOC3W", "B008SAPC20", "B003Y5H59M", "B00HERVMTK", "B00AVSFIV2", "B0032KNA4I", "B000L212HW", "B001FB55I0", "B0018O4YSQ", "B002ZG997M", "B002ZG9788", "B008G33O0G", "B000VDDWE2", "B00K2CHVSK", "B001GCUO5W", "B005J4TLQG", "B000PC6A3E", "B0027VT9ES", "B001F7MSG6", "B0051T46XM", "B00111YM60", "B001GZ6QEC", "B002HR1W1K", "B004SIPA4G", "B001OQCVII", "B001JNNDBA", "B001GKJ2FC", "B000WQWPKA", "B000OT6V00", "B0021L8UXK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004EPYZQ2", "B00IO8VMB6", "B004LWZW4W", "B005LAIHY0"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "asin": "B00005JPXY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Wm5GO98oL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Cloverfield [Theatrical Release]"}
{"description": "Nearly 20 years after riding his last Crusade, Harrison Ford makes a welcome return as archaeologist/relic hunter Indiana Jones inIndiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, an action-packed fourth installment that's, in a nutshell, less memorable than the first three but great nostalgia for fans of the series. Producer George Lucas and screenwriter David Koepp (War of the Worlds) set the film during the cold war, as the Soviets--replacing Nazis as Indy's villains of choice and led by a sword-wielding Cate Blanchett with black bob and sunglasses--are in pursuit of a crystal skull, which has mystical powers related to a city of gold. After escaping from them in a spectacular opening action sequence, Indy is coerced to head to Peru at the behest of a young greaser (Shia LaBeouf) whose friend--and Indy's colleague--Professor Oxley (John Hurt) has been captured for his knowledge of the skull's whereabouts. Whatever secrets the skull holds are tertiary; its reveal is the weakest part of the movie, as the CGI effects that inevitably accompany it feel jarring next to the boulder-rolling world of Indy audiences knew and loved. There's plenty of comedy, delightful stunts--ants play a deadly role here--and the return ofRaiderslove interest Karen Allen as Marion Ravenwood, once shrill but now softened, giving her ex-love bemused glances and eye-rolls as he huffs his way to save the day. Which brings us to Ford: bullwhip still in hand, he's a little creakier, a lot grayer, but still twice the action hero of anyone in film today. With all the anticipation and hype leading up to the film's release, perhaps no reunion is sweeter than that of Ford with the role that fits him as snugly as that fedora hat.--Ellen A.

{"description": "You know you're going to get a different kind of superhero when you cast Robert Downey Jr. in the lead role. AndIron Manis different, in welcome ways. Cleverly updated from Marvel Comics' longstanding series,Iron Manputs billionaire industrialist Tony Stark (that's Downey) in the path of some Middle Eastern terrorists; in a brilliantly paced section, Stark invents an indestructible suit that allows him to escape. If the rest of the movie never quite hits that precise rhythm again, it nevertheless offers plenty of pleasure, as the renewed Stark swears off his past as a weapons manufacturer, develops his new Iron Man suit, and puzzles both his business partner (Jeff Bridges in great form) and executive assistant (Gwyneth Paltrow). Director Jon Favreau geeks out in fun ways with the hardware, but never lets it overpower the movie, and there's always a goofy one-liner or a slapstick pratfall around to break the tension. As for Downey, he doesn't get to jitterbug around too much in his improv way, but he brings enough of his unpredictable personality to keep the thing fresh. And listen up, hardcore Marvel mavens: even if you know the Stan Lee cameo is coming, you won't be able to guess it until it's on the screen.

{"description": "Here's hoping James Mangold's big, raucous, and ultrabloody remake of3:10 to Yumaleads some moviegoers to check outDelmer Daves's beautifully lean, half-century-old original. That classic Western spun a tale of captured outlaw Ben Wade (Glenn Ford)--deadly but disarmingly affable--and the small-time rancher and family man, Dan Evans (Van Heflin), desperate enough to accept the job of helping escort the badman to Yuma prison. Wade, knowing that his gang will be along at any moment to spring him, works at persuading the ultimately lone deputy to accept a bribe, turn his back on \"duty,\" and go home safe and rich to his family. That the outlaw has come to admire his captor intriguingly complicates the suspense.All of the above applies in the new3:10, but it takes a lot more huffing and puffing to get Wade (Russell Crowe this time) and Evans (Christian Bale) into position for the showdown. Mostly, more is less. To Mangold's credit, his movie doesn't traffic in facile irony or postmodern detachment; it aims to be a straight-up Western and deliver the excitement and charisma the genre's fans are starved for. But recognizing that contemporary viewers might be out of touch with the bedrock simplicity and strength of the genre--not to mention its code of honor--Mangold has supplied both Evans and Wade with a plethora of backstory and \"motivations.\" At the overblown action climax, the crossfire of personal agendas is almost as frenetic as the copious gunplay. (By that point the movie has killed more people than the Lincoln County War.)Best thing about the remake is Russell Crowe's Ben Wade, a Scripture-quoting career villain with an artist's eye and a curiously principled sense of whom and when to murder. As his second-in-command, Ben Foster fairly pirouettes at every opportunity to commit mayhem, and Peter Fonda contributes a fierce portrait of an old Wade adversary turned bounty hunter for the Pinkerton detective agency.--Richard T.

{"description": "There are loads of extras onThe Spiderwick Chronicles (Two-Disc Field Guide Edition), beginning with a charming overview of the film's supernatural species conducted by director Mark Waters. Waters leads viewers through a primer describing such magical creatures as brownies, ogres, and fairies, taking the whole matter very seriously in the event anyone watching should ever encounter their like. \"It's a Spiderwick World!\" introduces Tony DiTerlizzi and Holly Black, creators of theThe Spiderwick Chroniclesbook series. The authors discuss the strange inspiration for the story: a letter they received from three siblings who claimed to have gone through exactly what the characters inSpiderwickendure. \"Arthur Spiderwick's Field Guide\" is a text- and illustration-based list of creatures in the film, with lots of fascinating factoids. \"Field Guild In-Movie Mode\" allows a viewer to enjoy the benefit of a pop-up guide that appears at times  during the film and lets a viewer click onto helpful information.\"Spiderwick: Meet the Clan!\" is an introduction to the film's cast, with a special emphasis on young star Freddie Highmore's precocious talent, a British child playing twin American brothers with unique speech patterns. \"Making Spiderwick!\" is a behind-the-scenes documentary on production of the film, focusing on production design, location, cinematography, and so on. Among the revelations is that everyone involved was looking for a place to film that could evoke a horror movie yet not be so scary as to turn off youngsters. \"The Magic of Spiderwick\" is a remarkable tour of the special-effects process that made this film work so well. Waters says his directing chores continued all the way through post-production, when he had to switch from directing actors to directing animators, often acting out the defining behaviors of the various mythic characters. \"A Final Word of Advice!\" brings Waters back in front of the camera, reminding us all how to deal with  hobgoblins and other spooks (keep a lot of honey, crackers and red tomato sauce around). Finally, \"Deleted Scenes\" includes some material that didn't make the feature's final cut, but which is shown in context with scenes that were on screen. The result is a more satisfying and enriching experience of deleted scenes than is usually found on DVD special features.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000OYCM5I", "B001NPD9JA", "1442487984", "B00AEFYIQ8", "B000Q66FB6", "1416986855", "B00139W3NE", "B0012IWO0I", "1416990119", "B001APZMJS", "0689859414", "B00AEFZ6V4", "B0016Q2D5M", "B00005JPH2", "B001LPWGBO", "B007R6DJP8", "B000DBHX4M", "B00443FMZM", "B000E8M0VA", "B000XUUQRE", "B004AKCME8", "B00009XUM5", "B002ZG99KO", "B002935GMS", "B004M1A21K", "1416903453", "B003RHZ6IE", "1416927573", "B00CWM58WY", "B000031EGV", "B004VMWTIO", "B003HARV3Y", "1442486929", "B0009NZ2KG", "B002OMIKHC", "0689859376", "B0012EM5D8", "B000P0J09W", "B00437IEI6", "B000YGGNMO", "0689859406", "0689859368", "B00LG6YEKE", "B008JFUNTG", "B00005JNQS", "B00128VA76", "B000065V42", "B001U3D88M", "B000M343BC", "B001LPWGFA", "0689859384", "B000V6I7M6", "0689859392", "B004SIPAFK", "B000NA28I4", "B001GCUO7A", "B00979KQFO", "B002GJTYIW", "B00AEFY9RG", "B004P7CNXQ", "B000BPL2GK", "B00G5G7EXY", "0689871333", "B004SIP75S", "B000J10FLY", "1442486945", "B0006JMLRK", "B00005JMCW", "B000C3L27U", "B003L20IJM", "B000NOKJC2", "B0000AK7AA", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B002WJI2QQ", "B0001HAISG", "0739356151", "B002ZG97YM", "B000P0J0A6", "B0018ATR2S", "B00005JLOT", "B000BITUVG", "B00003CXC3", "B00005JN5E", "B0000VCZKW", "6305123454", "B002NZK5SW", "B002UOMH00", "B00H5RYIBI", "B00AKGG5PS", "B00I6JOD2S", "B00BTYSIWI", "B005FLSZQU", "0689871325", "B00CHVJODE", "B00B04NIZO", "B00000K3D4", "B00009M9BK", "0689871317", "B0000640SC", "B003UYUQZW"], "bought_together": ["B000OYCM5I"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000OYCM5I", "B00AEFYIQ8", "B00HR34TBE", "B00HR2WIRC"]}, "price": 35.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 215455}, "asin": "B00005JPXS", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51YZb2i09tL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Spiderwick Chronicles (2-Disc Field Guide Edition)"}
{"description": "For anyone who thought the Oscar-winning documentaryMarch of the Penguinswas the most marvelous cinematic moment for these nomads of the south, you haven't seen nothing yet.Happy Feetis an animated wonder about a penguin named Mumble who can't sing, but can dance up a storm. George Miller, the driving force behind theBabe(andMad Max) movies, takes another creative step in family entertainment with this big, beautiful, music-fueled film that will have kids and their parents dancing in the streets. From his first moment alive, Mumble (voiced Elijah Woods) feels the beat and can't stop dancing. Unfortunately, emperor penguins are all about finding their own heart song, and the dancing youngster--as cute as he is--is a misfit. Luckily, he bumps into little blue penguins and a Spanish-infused group (led by Robin Williams) and begins a series of adventures. Miller has an exceptional variety of entertainment: Busby Berkley musical numbers, amusement-park thrills, exciting chase sequences (seals and orca lovers might like think otherwise), and even an environmental message that doesn't weigh you down. Best of all, you don't know where the movie is going in the last act, a rare occurrence these days in family entertainment. A fusion of rock songs, mashed-up and otherwise, are featured; this movie is as much a musical as a comedy. Mumble's solo dance to a new version of Stevie Wonder's \"I Wish\" by Fantasia, Patti, and Yolanda may be the most joyful moment on camera in 2006.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0006UEVT0", "B001DPHDCY", "B0006JMLRK", "B0012EM5D8", "B004HO6I4M", "B004EPZ0AC", "B002WJI2QQ", "B000AY74OG", "B0000AOX0O", "B00BG0RSJ4", "B00005JNQS", "B000RMJ4F8", "B0000640SC", "B005SDUV4E", "0783231474", "B00003CXJ4", "B00CWM58WY", "B0000VV4W2", "B0042U94UQ", "B0039N74CW", "6305161887", "B00AEFXMSS", "B000M343BC", "B00007LVCM", "B001ECQ75A", "B00005JNS0", "B00000JL8E", "B000GUJZ00", "B000056H26", "B008NNY9QW", "B004EPZ034", "B00G5G7EXY", "B000LPS2VI", "B005LAIH4A", "B00F522C7C", "B005LAIISA", "B00GDT5T9Y", "B007FF3HQM", "B000VBJEEG", "B003H9M1Q2", "B00029LO0Y", "B008JFUQ16", "B00005JMQZ", "B00EV1YZ96", "B000ION23A", "B0013FSL3E", "B003ZHVJGO", "B002ZG97YM", "B001NCDFTW", "B004G600A4", "B00009YXAW", "B005LAIHW2", "B00AFEX83C", "B00475B0H6", "B000UVKGPI", "B00ALMNCLQ", "B00HLTD2OE", "B00005JM7T", "B001HN6922", "B000BI5KV0", "B0013FSWT2", "B0030IIZ4M", "B004ODLUGM", "B001GCUO7A", "B005F96UJ6", "B000UFIYOO", "B000G75AZC", "B00005QFE1", "B0000VCZKW", "B00IEXX4KS", "B001THIQFO", "B000A2WAQK", "B001GCUNWQ", "B00B7EQPNE", "B002NZK5SW", "B0007PIDBQ", "B00AOCDDGC", "B000V5IP6U", "B0044RFTD8", "B00AEFXMGU", "B001KVZ6FW", "B00CHVJODE", "B000CZ0PT4", "B006JD48LO", "B0007Z0NYG", "B00EBBGLFC", "B00003CXB4", "B000BMGEJI", "B008YWY0HK", "B0002YLCOM", "B00E9ZATJO", "B004A8ZX3C", "B00I6JOD2S", "B005G3VCYY", "B00CQRN3QI", "B004OWQTZ0", "B0001OGUQI", "B004EPZ01G", "B00005JMFH", "B000GIXEWC"], "bought_together": ["B004HO6I4M"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004HO6I4M", "B00EBBGLFC", "B00G5G7EXY", "B00HR3D56O"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 21763}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.51, "brand": "Warner", "asin": "B00005JPCF", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51sX2Hrdz6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Happy Feet (Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "The Dark Knightarrives with tremendous hype (best superhero movie ever? posthumous Oscar for Heath Ledger?), and incredibly, it lives up to all of it.  But calling it the best superhero movie ever seems like faint praise, since part of what makes the movie great--in addition to pitch-perfect casting, outstanding writing, and a compelling vision--is that it bypasses the normal fantasy element of the superhero genre and makes it all terrifyingly real.  Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) is Gotham City's new district attorney, charged with cleaning up the crime rings that have paralyzed the city. He enters an uneasy alliance with the young police lieutenant, Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman), and Batman (Christian Bale), the caped vigilante who seems to trust only Gordon--and whom only Gordon seems to trust. They make progress until a psychotic and deadly new player enters the game: the Joker (Heath Ledger), who offers the crime bosses a solution--kill the Batman. Further complicating matters is that Dent is now dating Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal, after Katie Holmes turned down the chance to reprise her role), the longtime love of Batman's alter ego, Bruce Wayne.In his last completed role before his tragic death, Ledger is fantastic as the Joker, a volcanic, truly frightening force of evil. And he sets the tone of the movie: the world is a dark, dangerous place where there are no easy choices.  Eckhart and Oldman also shine, but as good as Bale is, his character turns out rather bland in comparison (not uncommon for heroes facing more colorful villains). Director-cowriter Christopher Nolan (Memento) follows his critically acclaimedBatman Beginswith an even better sequel that sets itself apart from notable superhero movies likeSpider-Man 2andIron Manbecause of its sheer emotional impact and striking sense of realism--there are no suspension-of-disbelief superpowers here. At 152 minutes, it's a shade too long, and it's much too intense for kids. But for most movie fans--and not just superhero fans--The Dark Knightis a film for the ages.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B00DUCXFUC", "B004LWZWGK", "B000PC6A3E", "B002ZG981E", "B00G4RD4PQ", "B0039208QM", "B001GMALGY", "B00E2Y0YBK", "B00C2IGQBA", "B0039208JE", "B00H14WTLQ", "B0039208CG", "B0085D3I3K", "B0039208C6", "B000M5AJQI", "B00319ECGK", "B001FB55H6", "B00EIG5M5A", "7020070078", "B00E2Y6AUY", "B00D5FMGGS", "B001OQCV6K", "B0013FBS20", "B000Q6GX5Y", "B001GKJ2FC", "B00FPS79F6", "B001992NUQ", "B004JMSIRC", "B001RIY4WE", "B00DYEN6XC", "B008QZ5PY2", "B001F7MSG6", "B00FAHYNWE", "B00J7PRJXU", "B001AQT0Z4", "B001UV4XEW", "B0083SBJXS", "B00AEFY552", "B00C8RD79O", "B007KAJG3K", "B007L4HET8", "B004EPZ07U", "B007L4HFDI", "B00AEFXKOO", "B000PC0U1W", "B00C6B8TB8", "B00HINFI4K", "B003TT2X6I", "B001KZIRM2", "B002ZG99NG", "B00EZ4M68G", "B004SIP90G", "B003ZHR6RK", "B001GCUO16", "B003TT2X6S", "B00JNEWSLS", "B001F3FUK6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00DUCXFUC", "B004LWZWGK", "B002ZG981E", "B000PC6A3E"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "asin": "B00005JPY0", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51pGxSkkz4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Dark Knight [Theatrical Release]"}
{"description": "Despite a gifted Anglo-American cast,Blow Drystrikes an uneasy balance between sentiment and camp. It aims for the same sort of high-wire act thatStrictly BallroomandPriscilla, Queen of the Desertpulled off so effortlessly, but melodrama wins the day. The comic moments are suitably over-the-top (as expected in a film about dueling hairdressers), but rarely as amusing as intended. The relationships between barbershop owner Phil (Alan Rickman), ex-wife Shelley (Natasha Richardson), and Sandra (Rachel Griffiths), \"the other woman,\" could be more fully developed but are affecting nonetheless.The setting is West Yorkshire. The event that brings them together is the British National Hairdressing Championships. Phil initially resists the urge to compete as it reminds him of the success he and Shelley once enjoyed, but his son Brian (Pearl Harbor's Josh Hartnett) convinces him to give it a go.Hartnett and Rachael Leigh Cook (She's All That), as the daughter of Phil's old nemesis, seem like peculiar casting choices for a British film, but Hartnett's accent is passable (Cook plays an American) and they don't embarrass themselves as much as supermodel Heidi Klum, who plays a tacky, two-timing hair model. The screenplay is by Simon Beaufoy ofFull Montyfame. Although not up to that standard--and certainly no match forShampoo(the greatest hairdressing movie of all time)--Blow Dryis still a good showcase for the talents of its three leads.--Kathleen C.

{"description": "The long road toPollockbegan when actor Ed Harris received a biography of Jackson Pollock from his father, who noticed that his son bore an uncanny resemblance to the artist. Harris's fascination with Pollock matched his physical similarity; the actor chose to direct and star in this impressive film biography. And his devotion assured a work of singular integrity, honoring the artist's achievement in abstract expressionism while acknowledging that Pollock was a tormented, manic-depressive alcoholic whose death at 44 (in a possibly suicidal car crash) also claimed the life of an innocent woman. The film also suggests that Pollock's success was largely attributable to the devotion of his wife, artist Lee Krasner, played with matching ferocity by Marcia Gay Harden in an Oscar&reg;-winning performance.In many respects a traditional biopic,Pollockbegins in 1941 when Pollock meets Krasner, who encourages him and attracts the attention of supportive critic Clement Greenberg (Jeffrey Tambor) and benefactor Peggy Guggenheim (Amy Madigan). As Pollock rises from obscurity to international acclaim, Harris brings careful balance to his portrayal of a driven creator who found peace during those brief, sober periods when art brought release from his tenacious inner demons. The film offers sympathy without sentiment, appreciation without misguided hagiography. As an acting showcase it's utterly captivating. As a compassionate but unflinching exploration of Jackson Pollock's intimate world, there's no doubt that Harris captured the essence of a man whose life was as torturous as his art was redeeming.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0030T120A", "B005TTEG3O", "B004SIP7S0", "B003ODIV10", "B000BYA4HY", "B0041I97CO", "B00116GEJ8", "B001CK7OM4", "B001CK7OLU", "B000WZAE7W", "B0043CT8GI", "B000AL72R8", "B000NVI0EY", "B002ZMZBIM", "B0001US61O", "B0051URXWM", "B003WKQ46E", "B0026BTRUK", "B003VTKZ8O", "B003MWHUMY", "B000CCCZYA", "0810984962", "B0009X7BHI", "B000GEIREQ", "B0006GANX2", "B000092T3B", "B001O7R768", "B008BWFP18", "B000053VBM", "B000IHYXK8", "B00470MG06", "B000YKYT2G", "B00EV1YZKK", "B004U7MR1Y", "B003ELMR8U", "B009B8YZ8U", "B001BWYT4E", "B000055XMV", "B003BR8MDQ", "0913391190", "3836512769", "B0031REQKE", "B000NO1XG8", "B000H6SXSI", "B002RB56WM", "B0064MT1SA", "B00HQF9UPI", "B00005AUKF", "B000E3LCXW", "B000QGDXG6", "B00BQXTDEO", "B003ELMR80", "B000KN7C1W", "B0011IR2R4", "B0077PBPNM", "B005DNDUEW", "B004CJQVQC", "B0007PALGG", "B003JHXS1E", "B0087HDEGA", "B0056G1ARU", "B000053VAV", "B0000TPAQA", "B000E3LCXC", "0226074064", "3822821357", "0060973676", "B0064MT1FI", "B002LC3M8M", "B004CYVZ5E", "6304712936", "B001P3SA8K", "B00003CXPV", "B000FFJYCK", "0780619587", "B00004STD8", "B004XVMCNK", "B003L16F5Y", "B000E33VWW", "B0011NVC8Y", "B004SUDQ8G", "B00B5EC9BI", "B0041I97C4", "B005J4TLQ6", "B0041KKYEM", "B0043CT8GS", "B0009U6XD4", "B0011FLH14", "B00005UQ7S", "B0002JL9N6", "B00003CWN3", "B00GUO2SKA", "B002SF9YUM", "B0006A9I2U", "0792845803", "B000063N9O", "B00441GZ00", "B00CBFB8SU", "0815410093"], "bought_together": ["B004SIP7S0", "B0030T120A"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004SIP7S0", "B0030T120A", "B000BYA4HY", "B0006GANX2"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 16504}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.99, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B00005KHJJ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51P6XQX68ZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Pollock (Special Edition)"}

Schneider plays Marvin Mange, a schlub of a police file clerk who drives off a cliff and is horribly mangled--only to wake up not only whole, but feeling better than he ever has in his life. He suddenly develops strange powers that lead to him being praised as a super cop. Unfortunately, his powers are the result of a scientist's bizarre experiment--and before long, some side effects start to take over his life. It's hard to put a finger on Schneider's appeal, but he's got something.

{"description": "Jean-Claude Van Damme may never have risen to the top ranks of action stars, but his movies have been consistently enjoyable--partly because they don't take themselves too seriously. InThe Order, Van Damme plays a thief of religious artifacts whose archeologist father has found the lost scripture of a mysterious religious order. When the old man is kidnapped, Van Damme soon finds himself cruising around the twisty streets of Jerusalem, getting into dynamic kickboxing battles while disguised as a Hasidic Jew. With the help of a beautiful Israeli cop (Sofia Milos), Van Damme uncovers a plot within the religious order that leads to secret catacombs beneath the holy city. Silly? Perhaps, but directed with vitality and surprising wit. Van Damme is trim and energetic, Milos is engaging, and a cameo by Charlton Heston (!) only adds to the general atmosphere of spunky fun.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305259429", "B00005N5QW", "B00441GYY2", "076780970X", "B0011VIO46", "6305551235", "B0099KJFJ4", "B00596WEVI", "B0087OULG4", "B002U6CJCO", "B001L2ZSJO", "B000N3T0E6", "B001M9ELQC", "0767821548", "B002TVQ4CG", "B0006JGIQU", "B000GDH9IW", "0767804252", "B000022TSJ", "0783226748", "B008XAT1HM", "B0002S94CK", "B001PWY4NG", "B000ENUYH2", "0783114885", "B0000542CC", "B00HVFA2VE", "B00A34LX9A", "0783228465", "B00069L0Y0", "B0041QSZLA", "B001FWRYYC", "B00HODLW6C", "B008NP4ZUU", "0783219660", "B001T21R5U", "B0000542CD", "B0000DJZ9Q", "0783225520", "B00006RCOC", "B0002848WQ", "B0090EDEM8", "0783227892", "B000255LCK", "B00IKM5OCO", "0790740826", "0792835735", "B004MLEYUU", "B0045HCJ5S", "B000E6ESD0", "B00003CXW4", "B00BLF9FOK", "B002G1WPIG", "B008XAT0SW", "B000QXDCLU", "B000F6IOCA", "B001VFM0YC", "B000LC4Z7Q", "B006JN8798", "B000RW3VCK", "B0002V7OI8", "B00J11U54K", "B000SM6FLI", "B00007JZUP", "B003Z94WBG", "B000006PAB", "B00HW3LAF2", "B002GHHHME", "B0030E5PWQ", "B000A5043S", "B003ZJWXCQ", "B001AR010Q", "B0000844MD", "B004L1DB78", "B0062P3392", "B0035G5IZI", "B0000ALPFJ", "B000KX0HIW", "B001MLZNKS", "B001QB9H10", "B00E5SAJ5Y", "B00A4TMLNG", "B0045HCJG2", "B00GM1X2JM", "B00009MEBU", "B00AKGG828", "B00HZMZ2FE", "B00026ZG10", "6305161992", "B0015FQZIK", "6304884400", "6304712898", "B008E70EES", "B002ZG999U", "B000FO0A9W", "B00BTYRB2G", "B000MEYKEG", "B0011VIO4Q", "B0045HCIWW", "6305428158"], "bought_together": ["B00005N5QW", "6305259429"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0000TPA0G", "B0074B2NBC", "B0002S94CK", "B00441GYY2"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 78874}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.88, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B00005V4XK", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51SVY6Y6VRL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Order"}

{"description": "When the firstEvangelionfeature,Death and Rebirth, proved no more satisfying than the last episodes of the original series, Hideaki Anno brought his watershed epic to its conclusion in this final installment.End of Evangelionbegins where the series ended: with the Angels defeated, the sinister cabal SEELE attacks NERV headquarters to seize the  Evas and realize their plan for humanity. Misato and Ritsuko fight from inside while Asuka decimates a new Eva series. But when Rei merges with Lilith, and Shinji seems to fuse with Unit 01, the final traces of a coherent storyline dissolve into a protracted collage of fantastic images, played against discussions involving Rei, Shinji, Asuka, and Kaoru. Anno's dazzling apocalyptic vision forms a weird but oddly logical finale that ultimately means whatever the viewer chooses to read into it. This unrated feature, suitable for ages 17 and older, contains considerable violence, profanity, grotesque imagery, and sexual  situations.--Charles Solomon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000068OIY", "B000767QTA", "B0000639E0", "B004EC5IV6", "B0030ZOYJ0", "B004EC5IUW", "B0030ZOYHC", "B00GS1EOJS", "B00GS1DM2S", "B00004REOQ", "B000059H1R", "B00102FF7U", "1421553627", "B002EBRF7O", "1421553635", "B0083QJW8O", "B00005ASO0", "B001D265RQ", "6304493681", "B007V9ECV6", "B000056MMB", "1421552914", "B004DMIISM", "B00B40N2UK", "1421553058", "B00005BJX2", "B00AUJH32E", "B008YRL7JE", "B00005JIX3", "B003P3PQNA", "B00000JL42", "B004R0MF0M", "B004DMIIPA", "B0000YEE44", "B00441GYS8", "1421550792", "B0050XP886", "B000050IL8", "B00B1RB8AC", "B003VOVW90", "B006O94DLI", "B001W79MBS", "B00011ZBUW", "B003VQO4W0", "B00HFC30A8", "B0028X6L1Y", "B003SPDSA8", "B00CU6WB5Y", "B00DICPBP6", "B008D1RCS6", "B00HFC547A", "B0006A9FMI", "B00BZC029G", "B00HXEWGLW", "B009B82FCS", "B005OK0YU2", "B00HXEWGY4", "B00ENNA62W", "B00CU6WBOU", "B00B1RB942", "B004VDL826", "B004GZZH6W", "B00AO05AGA", "B0019HABE8", "B00II6C66E", "B0043988G2", "B0071LEPDE", "B004GZZGW2", "B008D1RDIU", "1595823778", "B004O05NN6", "B00CRRCF20", "B004G9UXEY", "1421507676", "B0084DVVTE", "B000PWQPAC", "B0050UEVKK", "B00ENNBZ68", "B008NNY9YE", "B00576U9JE", "1595823212", "B000VWYJ5Y", "B00014X8KO", "B00G0OM22O", "B005WMQ5R8", "B002NUULNG", "B0001EFTVA", "B000CEV3O6", "B002KYIAJ2", "B000VWYJ68", "B00ENNUC9Y", "B00BQ1DDUG", "B00GS1JRPY", "B00KU3Y2VK", "B00GY3S6LW", "B007V9EACC", "B00CJ7Y19I", "B001CZJP0S", "B000KGH03Y"], "bought_together": ["B000068OIY", "B0030ZOYHC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004EC5IV6", "B0030ZOYJ0", "B00GS1EOJS", "B000068OIY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 64113}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 186.41, "brand": "", "asin": "B000068OJ1", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510XMKV4TDL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Neon Genesis Evangelion: The End of Evangelion"}

{"description": "A very credible entry in theHellraiserseries,Hellraiser: Hellseekerpresents a nifty puzzle for gore fans, plus plenty of philosophical musings from the ineffable Pinhead (\"Personally, I prefer pain\"). A smoldering Dean Winters plays a man who survives a car accident in which his wife was apparently killed; because of a head injury, his memory is mixed up, and he can't distinguish between reality and fantasy. The borrowings fromMementoare obvious, and the fragmented story pieces may not all fit together, but the mystery does become tantalizing.

{"description": "A thriller that's nearly devoid of thrills? That's not a complaint--it's what makesThe American Friendone of the most stylish (and, at the time, most expensive) films to emerge from the New German Cinema of the 1970s. Loosely adapting Patricia Highsmith's mystery novelRipley's Game, director Wim Wenders shifted priority from plotting to character, emphasizing a richly colorful and atmospheric approach to locations in Hamburg, where a picture-framer (Bruno Ganz) is lured into an assassination scheme involving a mysterious Frenchman (Gerard Blain) and the titular American friend, Tom Ripley (played by Dennis Hopper, a far cry from Matt Damon's portrayal of the same character inThe Talented Mr. Ripley). The plotting is vague to the point of irrelevance; Wenders prefers to maintain theauraof mystery, as opposed to generating any conventional suspense, and expresses his affection for American movies by casting favorite directors Nicholas Ray and Samuel Fuller in pivotal supporting roles. The result is an intoxicating example of cinematic cross-pollination.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00018D40O", "B00HRISNPM", "B00HT2RTU6", "B009D004TA", "B000069I09", "B00HVOFP12", "B009D0050I", "B0009GX1CE", "B00007ELDG", "B00AEFXR8I", "B00005BHW6", "B0002XNSZE", "B000N3T0H8", "B00I116MZ2", "B00005JLJW", "B000063K2Q", "B000CNE088", "B0009HMTDU", "B00HT2L7VS", "B00006RCNV", "B001EKP5D2", "031228666X", "B000063JZQ", "B00000F7E6", "B002KECJZ8", "B0000BUZKP", "B0045HCJ8U", "6305972761", "B000H5V8H2", "B00AEFXN9G", "B00366F2NU", "B00AEBB8SS", "B000FFJYAW", "B000AQKUG8", "B0006Z2NE0", "B002IVDLGE", "B000B8384Q", "B0007989Y8", "B00005QAPI", "B00000JQSE", "B00005YUO1", "B009NYF2GQ", "B00DZP1C9K", "B005TJ8GJ4", "B00A1AU63A"], "bought_together": ["B00018D40O", "B009D004TA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0001LJCQQ", "B00018D40O", "B0035ECHJA", "B009D004TA"]}, "price": 48.88, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 206604}, "asin": "B00006LPC6", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515BS3QAAJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The American Friend"}

{"description": "Kevin Bacon and Charlize Theron square off in a smarter-than-average kidnapping thriller. Joe (Bacon), Cheryl (Courtney Love), and Marvin (Pruitt Taylor Vince) are a kidnapping team with the perfect plan. Perfect, that is, until they pick on the wrong wholesome but incredibly feisty young family. There's the plot, and boom--you're off. Though it certainly hits all the right buttons,Trappedis far from a by-the-numbers suspense movie. There are a few genuinely surprising plot twists, and while many movies dull their villains' edges by cartoonishly over- or underplaying their evil,Trappedis refreshingly unafraid to make Joe realistically, skin-crawlingly vile. Even our heroes turn out to have surprising sadistic streaks. Toward the end, the movie takes a sharp right turn toward the ludicrous, with nearly every major character making at least one completely illogical decision, but by that point you're already strapped in, so you may as well just sit back and enjoy.--Ali Davis", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0006J27WO", "B002S5N052", "B004SIP9CO", "B0029Z8K74", "B00026ZD04", "B0015OKWK8", "B000CQLZ8S", "B000Y7U97I", "B004P7CNVS", "B0002DB54A", "B000KF0DDY", "0783222149", "B00029RT9E", "B004P7CMVE", "B00AEBBA2W", "B00005RYKU", "B00AEFXCLU", "0780628551", "B00133KFH6", "B00006HAWN", "B00015YVDG", "0767810872", "B00BTYJYOY", "B0007PID84", "6305065551", "B004SUDQAE", "B00005JMWP", "B00005Y1UV", "B00005JKQS", "B000HT38IK", "6305213305", "B0011V7PSC", "B000E5KURY", "B00AEFXBPM", "B00AEFXKZ8", "B002GIBVWA", "B000EOTV98", "B00AEFXT1S", "B003MI2GHM", "B00AEFYF2K", "B004SIP6C2", "B0002WT4OE", "B00FRILRL6", "B00562I40K", "B00BEIYIF0", "0780620887", "B000MTFFO0", "B00005JH9M", "B00AEBB8ZG", "B002QW7AMG", "B002H6NVM4", "B00003CXKA", "B000U1ZV76", "B00AEFXEGS", "B00009WVSL", "B002NZK5RI", "B00J5G1P2W", "B0034G4P30", "0767815718", "B0002IQLHQ", "B000RGN2JI", "B002BEJ3BA", "B002O3Z4ZW", "B0007R4SX6", "0790730979", "0783240295", "B000BVM1S2", "B00005BCKF", "B00GNAO70K", "B0020LH8WU", "B002AS464Q", "B004EC5ITI", "B00008EY9G", "B009AMAJPA", "B002O3Z4Y8", "B00803PG44", "B0000ZMGWK", "B0031RAOY6", "B00096S49Y", "B0006D3HGA", "B00BB67UNW", "B00DZP1C2W", "B001QOGYFO", "B00H9LHVHI", "B000WP07F6", "B00013RC7K", "B002NZK5VO", "B005LAIHCM", "B0010KP360", "B007IUEEA2", "B00092ZLSK", "B0071HPP3M", "B000056PMU", "B00005YU1M", "6305161933", "0767812743", "6305308837", "B0083QN87K", "B000I2J736"], "bought_together": ["B0006J27WO", "B002S5N052"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0029Z8K74", "B0006J27WO", "B002S5N052", "B00365QS9I"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 25714}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.65, "brand": "Columbia/Tristar Studios", "asin": "B00007AJE1", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RM961F10L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Trapped"}

Only a fool would perceive even a slight connection to Wells's classic novel, to which this misleadingly titled cheese-fest is ostensibly a sequel. Their careers in sorry decline, Jack Palance, Carol Lynley, Barry Morse (late of TV'sSpace: 1999), and John Ireland look embarrassed as they wrestle with a wearisome post-apocalyptic plot that pitches Morse, a pair of Ken-and-Barbie heroes, and their quirky robot (of course) against megalomaniac emperor Palance, who controls a drug needed for survival of moon-based colonists. Prior to directing this laughable mess, George McCowan had helmed episodes of several prominent TV action series of the '70s, but here he devolves into moribund hackwork.

The first commentary track is a combination of informative but subdued remarks by director Clark Johnson spliced with a track by Samuel L. Jackson and five other actors (but not Colin Farrell) together.  The comments by the actors are infrequent, raucous, and forgettable. There's also a commentary track by four of the writers, who discuss how they were writingS.W.A.T.when the North Hollywood shootout (on which the opening scene is based) took place, and what writers think about actors who improvise. The making-of featurette gives plenty of exposure and credit to the real-life S.W.A.T. officers who helped with the film, and a featurette on the original TV series is interesting, even though it's basically an advertisement for theDVD set.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004H2P6II", "B00005JLX2", "B0015LPRZQ", "B0025KVKDO", "B00005JLQN", "B0001XAQ9Q", "B00005JL3K", "B000J4QWMC", "B000A2X3MU", "B002ZG99N6", "B00275EGWY", "B000FJGR76", "B002AT8K9W", "B000KX0HFK", "B00AEBB86A", "B004LGGXG4", "B001MZ5W3M", "B000G5SILC", "B001BP4K22", "B00004Z1FX", "B000QUCRB4", "B000HC2M2K", "6304806434", "B00003CXNY", "B000TJBN80", "B000KLQUSU", "0790736411", "B00HLTD3ZW", "1558908315", "B000VG66XS", "B00016MSV2", "B002ZG994U", "B004V8W52S", "B008E70EES", "B000065U1N", "B000X1Z0C4", "B0000VJG72", "B00004Z4WR", "B0007W7I4W", "0767803434", "B0010YVCB6", "B00005JKTP", "B0034G4OUO", "B00005QW6V", "6304698747", "B000K7UBSO", "B000FFL2G6", "B000F8DV1M", "B004EPYZUS", "B000274T94", "B00004STUL", "B002VWNIEA", "B000095WW8", "B00000FZL2", "B00ECXJBN8", "B0000B1OFL", "B00AEFY0XE", "B00562I40K", "0792835727", "B0009KA7XG", "B000BTITKS", "B000KGGIZK", "B00009ZPUA", "B0002IQMAM", "B0058ZPNBI", "B005LAIIPS", "B001QB9H10", "B001O5LVVC", "B001UV4XGA", "B004HO6HWA", "B00BUC4TJ0", "B00BEIYHO2", "B004P3ENLA", "B0006GANOQ", "B0019EXZY4", "B00000G3PA", "B0013J55B6", "B002GHHHL0", "B00004STDN", "B0009DWL8W", "6304711891", "B0034G4ORC", "B003Y5H5FG", "B00BB67UNW", "B001ILHY1I", "B004EPYZQC", "B002AT8KA6", "0790732149", "B00260HH2G", "B000CQLZ8S", "B005LAIH2C", "B002ZG97RE", "B003M987QK", "B000A0GP0Y", "B000KX0HIW", "B00009L1TA", "B00005V9I6", "0783240295", "B000P0J0BK", "B0000542CK"], "bought_together": ["B004H2P6II"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00008YLVB", "B000M341QE", "B005CFBYW6", "B003Q6D2B4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 24979}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.98, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B00008EYA5", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51BEAR8WT7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "S.W.A.T.

{"description": "Friends and Family is a delightful and clever comedy. The plot, and many subplots actually, are a bit far-fetched, but they provides pure escapism, which we all need sometimes. The characters, as unbelievable as they are, come out as totally outrageous, much needed in a comedy of this nature. The story becomes so over the top, it borders on ridiculous, but manages to entertain,  while being totally hilarious. \\nI really enjoyed this film and smiled throughout at the pure absurdity of it all. The cast was good, the acting okay, but the characters were terrific in my mind. Yes, some people might consider these people stereotypes, but the stereotype came about for a reason....these people actually EXIST! The only real problem I had, and for a movie like this it's a big one, is the displays of affection between the two leads. I don't need to see full on gay sex, but it would have been nice to have seen the couple at least share a light kiss or two. The end did have them hold hands, with beautiful dialogue expressing their love for each other, and I would have liked to see more of that throughout, just a couple more times at least. It showed a human side to these killers that we just needed to see more of. \\nThis is a cross between La Cage Aux Follies (The Birdcage), The Sopranos, and Mambo Italiano, but is too Disneyfied for it's own good. Actually, it's one 'gay film' the whole family can enjoy-- no sex, no profanity, and only very mild violence. I'd definitely rate it a PG.

{"description": "The passion of oral surgeons is the unlikely subject ofThe Secret Lives of Dentists, Alan Rudolph's keenly observed comedy-drama. Campbell Scott and Hope Davis, dentists both, have three kids and a pleasant life. Pleasant, but not exciting. When Scott realizes his wife is having an affair on the side, he's torn between caution and an outrageous inner voice urging drastic action. That voice is personified by Denis Leary, who pops up with unwelcome advice, like a nattering ghost; needless to say, the role is a perfect fit for Leary's hostile persona. The blend of everyday realities--especially a hilariously miserable five-day siege with stomach flu--and Leary's surreal presence makes for a typically offbeat Rudolph offering. The smart script, after a Jane Smiley story, is by Craig Lucas. Indie stalwarts Scott and Davis both do subtle work--they're as careful and scrupulous as the dentists they portray.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JLX8", "B001FRNB9E", "B000N9CM7W", "B0043SL1FI", "B000VY1F1S", "B005CFBZXO", "B0007P0XAK", "B00006CXH1", "B0000714E7", "B0007989KW", "B002OVB9VW", "B000BZN1OQ", "B0045NXMJE", "B00003CXQ4", "B0002XNT12", "B00366BBTO", "B001FFBI6Y", "B00004WI57", "6305223122", "B00BLN4UDS", "B00004STRF", "6305922675", "B00005RDRT", "B0009ETCR4", "B00004Z1F8"], "bought_together": ["B000N9CM7W"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0007P0XAK", "B000E3L7E6", "B001FRNB9E", "B00008HC9B"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 210346}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.54, "brand": "", "asin": "B0000X2EJ2", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5176H3SF88L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Secret Lives Of Dentists"}

{"description": "Like the movie, the DVD extras are smarter and a lot more entertaining than your average flick. The making-of feature (\"Lessons Learned\") has the usual behind-the-scenes banter but Jack Black is in fine form--that is, something special--interviewing as much as being interviewed about the making of the film. His unique pitch to Led Zeppelin to use their song is alone worth the price of the DVD. Black is more his maniacal self and a bit more grating in MTV's Diary segment, but his commentary track with director Richard Linklater is as insightful as it is funny. Ok, it's a lot more funny, but entertaining throughout. The commentary track featuring just the kid actors is less so, but any preteen would love listening to it. To top it off, the DVD-ROM has Dewey Finn's instantly famous blackboard history of rock. You can drill down to the bands mentioned and get a brief history of each.

{"description": "The plot of the popular teen comedyMarmalade Boyconsists of a series of interlocking romantic polygons that suggest a cross betweenThe Brady BunchandAs the World Turns. Toryo High School junior Miki Koshikawa is appalled when her parents announce that they and their friends the Matsuras have decided to divorce, switch partners, remarry, and live together. This marital mix-and-match scheme forces Miki into contact with the Matsuras' handsome son Yuu. His mischievous sense of humor plays against what is basically a warm, gentle nature, leading Miki to compare him to the bittersweet taste of orange marmalade.The budding romance between Miki and Yuu upsets Ginta, whom Miki nurtured a crush on two years earlier. Arimi, Yuu's conniving former girlfriend, suggests she and Ginta pretend to date to make Miki jealous. Their sham romance infuriates Ginta's obnoxious cousin Tsutomu, who adores Arimi and hates Yuu. Tsutomu provides welcome comic relief, as he's always losing bets that require him to shave his head. Meanwhile, Meiko, Miki's best friend, dodges the attentions of student body president Satoshi to pursue a star-crossed romance with one of her teachers.It's not clear just what Yuu and Ginta see in fussy, indecisive Miki. The relationships inMarmalade Boygo through more twists and turns than an L.A. freeway, but the series ran for 76 episodes--three times as long asEvangelion, which also debuted in 1995--and has remained popular ever since.

What she finds is a veterinarian named  Francois (Edouard Baer,Alias Betty), whose ambivalence about being  Jewish leads Michelle to study the faith and consider conversion. The plot  sounds heavy, butGod Is Great (And I'm Not)is actually a light,  fluid movie that's as alert to the thousand tiny ways in which men and  women miscommunicate and defeat their best intentions. Michelle's  spiritual yearnings are questionable, yet Tautou captures her hunger for  something more and makes it real, even if it may also be shallow.

{"description": "The first movie produced by Afghanistan filmmakers after the fall of the  Taliban,Osamais a searing portrait of life under the oppressive  fundamentalist regime. Because women are not allowed to work, a widow  disguises her young daughter (Marina Golbahari) as a boy so they won't  starve to death. Simply walking the streets is frightening enough, but  when the disguised girl is rounded up with all the boys in the town for  religious training, her peril becomes absolutely harrowing. Golbahari's  face--beautiful but taut with terror--is riveting. The movie captures both  her plight and the miseries of daily life in spare, vivid images. At one  point, her mother is nearly killed for exposing her feet while riding on  the back of a bicycle; for the entire scene, the camera shows only her  feet, with the spokes of the wheel radiating out behind as she lowers her  burka over them.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0031DDGA4", "B0012OX7EO", "B000089RTN", "B000065V3Z", "B00GMV8B1G", "B0087OULO6", "B000GIXE86", "B002U4F5W2", "B00116VG3M", "B000EHQ7JC", "B00004VVO5", "B002VRNJT4", "B006IW8E3Y", "B002M36R50", "B000A7LR82", "B002T921C0", "B000E0OE44", "B00HXH00ZI", "B001JH7F42", "B000S0GYD4", "B000FC2FX8", "B000B91N3S", "6305835357", "B0016MLIK2", "B008NNY98U", "B00DJYJOPG", "B0007R4T3U", "B00005JLD4", "B00AEFYF9I", "B001BOCCPA", "B00GMV89CM", "B00000F5KH", "B0015OKWKI", "B0031DDG9U", "B003BKZ1OG", "B001BNFR76", "B00078XGP6", "B000SM6FLI", "B00ATK0452", "B000IHYXH6", "B000H5V8H2", "B000AM4P90", "B00005JLR8", "B000WC38IC", "161145025X", "B000N3T0DW", "B00G4Q3KOC", "B00GOT1244", "B00006AW0I", "B00080Z53O", "B004Z6N7HS", "B000LAZE8C", "B002PLMJ74", "B00FGVS07S", "B0012QE4PI", "B0009PW3RO", "B000U2U0E4", "B002M2T1V8", "B0002TT0MI", "B00007KQ9V", "B0013B34X0", "B000O76ZQC", "B0013D8LNG", "B0009PW3RE", "B000058AOI", "B0028FGSQK", "B0086900LG", "B0000C2IW7", "B004XVMCMG", "B00005QFE5", "B000AQ6A4E", "B0000A02Y4", "B000TXNDV6", "B000YAA68W", "1596981040", "B005HFI7IU", "B000934FC2", "B0057ZAA0S", "B000UJ48SQ", "B0024EWP6W", "0385526229", "B004SIP8ZM", "B002SF9YNO", "B00GUO2SKA", "B00443FMKM", "B0002ZA1HA", "B0001US61O", "159463193X", "6305999872", "B00003L9CK", "B000A8AXXG", "B00AEFYCW8", "079284646X", "0786464720", "B0000AKCLX", "B001H5ZQHY"], "bought_together": ["B0031DDGA4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0031DDGA4", "B000089RTN", "B0012OX7EO", "B001JH7F42"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 19667}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 37.97, "brand": "TWENTIETH CENTURY FOX HOME ENT", "asin": "B0001IXTDG", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514AVSFD7CL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Osama"}

{"description": "Hayao Miyazaki gained widespread attention in Japan for his complex ecological manga series,Nausica&#xE4; of the Valley of the Wind(1982), which he adapted for the screen two years later. One thousand years after a war devastated much of the Earth, humanity clings to existence at the fringes of a vast, polluted forest inhabited by monstrous insects. Only Nausica&#xE4;, the princess of the tiny realm of the Valley of the Wind, grasps the environmental significance of the forest. She sees beyond petty wars and national rivalries to the only viable future for the planet. InNausica&#xE4;, Miyazaki began to explore elements he would develop more fully in his later films: daring, compassionate heroines; exciting flying sequences; colorful side characters; strong interpersonal relationships; and a call for an ecologically sustainable way of life. Nausica&#xE4; prefigures Sheeta inCastle in the Skyand Chihiro inSpirited Away, just as the rough and ready Asbel anticipates Pazu inCastle in the Skyand Ashitaka inPrincess Mononoke. For years,Nausica&#xE4;was available in the United States only as the badly re-editedWarriors of the Wind. The new English dub from Disney presents the film in its entirety, with strong vocal performances by Uma Thurman, Patrick Stewart, Alison Lohman, and Edward James Olmos.

He plays a writer, depressed and nearly divorced, who's stuck in an isolated cabin (shades ofThe Shining) when a stranger (John Turturro) arrives, accusing him of plagiarism. Writer-director David Koepp (Stir of Echoes) does his best to make the rickety material compelling--he gets the maximum out of the cabin set, for instance--but the problems inherent in the King story eventually win out. The climactic scenes are particularly unpleasant, especially in contrast to the cleverness of Depp's performance.

{"description": "The two main extras ofCody Banks 2: Destination Londonare targeted toward kids.  Rather than a full-length audio-only commentary track, Frankie Muniz, Anthony Anderson, and Hannah Spearritt appear in a \"visual cast commentary,\" in which they pause the movie and come on-screen to discuss it.  Their comments are brief and intended for younger viewers (\"One of the greatest things about making a movie is how they edit it\" or \"Those Segways are the coolest things ever invented.\").

{"description": "What's scarier than scary kids?Village of the Damnedis the definitive scary-kid classic, a truly unsettling film drawn from John Wyndham's novelThe Midwich Cuckoos. The brilliant opening sequence depicts the sudden and temporary paralysis of a small English hamlet, which is followed by the town's women becoming mysteriously pregnant. The spawn of this occurrence are a dozen eerie, blond-headed children, who are either gifted, evil, or \"the world's new people.\" A splendid outing, not least in the way it catches parental anxiety about this small new stranger in one's home. (It was remade by John Carpenter in 1995.)Children of the Damnedfollows up with a story about six more creepy kids, brought from all over the globe to huddle in a old church in London. An excellent opening half-hour gets bogged down in the movie's global-political ambitions (it's very much a cold war offering), but it has its share of shivery moments--the sight of the six youngsters striding down a London street as though they controlled the world is a chiller. But where's the blond hair? The two films are different in tone;Villagefeels like a fifties sci-fi offering, with an old-school star (George Sanders) and classical style;Childrenis a film of the sixties, with hipper techniques, urban setting, and young actors Ian Hendry and Alan Badel. But both have those damned kids.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783230427", "B000A0GOF0", "B00027JYNK", "B0009X75EC", "B000063UR0", "B007Y1NNAW", "B00LU4URS0", "B0000694WH", "B00005R1O7", "B000AYELJ2", "B00009NHC0", "B0007R4T26", "B005HIBWBG", "B002945DUW", "B000RXVNDI", "B00AEBB8VK", "B00518A70E", "B000UDGOBG", "6305869367", "B0045HCJJE", "B00D9EJFV4", "B00LC4PEZ4", "B00D9EJFZA", "B000G6BLYM", "B001B9ZVVC", "B00005JKFR", "B00000K3U3", "B00005LIRD", "0783116926", "B000EHSVJG", "B00005NSXY", "B000UAFDR0", "B00K6D1S7A", "B000FOPPEC", "B000A0GOEQ", "B000A0GOFA", "B00DZP1C9K", "B000OHZJGO", "B005ETANC2", "B000068TPG", "0991127900", "B000AQKU72", "6305761078", "B0045HCJSA", "B0048O2YWG", "B00DOZNGC2", "B0034PWPHY", "B000C20VNM", "B00KSPST6Y", "B00023P4TM", "B000HT38B2", "B0009X770E", "B00009PY4D", "B000FFJZO2", "B00KIZY0EE", "B00K2CHVSK", "B0000694WM", "B0009X770O", "B000S0GYBG", "B000FVQLKW", "B0013XZ6SY", "B00AEBB94G", "B00009NHBC", "B004X63SCY", "B00KIZYDCI", "B00B94VJYW", "B000062XEY", "B0053TWVDC", "B001BSBBNK", "6305944288", "B00009PY2T", "B001BSBBGC", "B005D0RDKM", "B000BYA5IC", "B00003CXCF", "B000RXVNCO", "B000OHBCI8", "B00009PY4A", "B00009PY38", "B00006SFIT", "B00023P4UQ", "B00027JYLC", "B002TSAAS8", "B00DSAUJ32", "B00465I1BK", "B00005Y6XR", "B00005R1O8", "B00IYJFB2G", "B0045HCJKS", "B0002IQL8K", "B005GPFZEK", "B000TLTCT0", "B000EHSVJ6", "B000HEWEDK", "B00ITZXDDY", "B0000A9GHP", "6305772681", "B00006CXGP", "6305772142", "B0009PLLMC"], "bought_together": ["0783230427"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0783230427", "B00027JYNK", "B0009X75EC", "B000063UR0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 29525}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.05, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00027JYMG", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51SknyPjhrL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Village of the Damned/Children of the Damned"}
{"description": "\"Just remember, she might be pint-sized, but she's quite a woman.\" The original surfer girl gets her own three-film DVD collection, dippy fun from a more innocent time. 1959'sGidgetmade real surfers nauseated, but it's a kicky movie with some great lounge-era lingo. Sandra Dee, perkiness personified, plays the curious teen who breaks the gender line in surfing. She's also got the attention of surf-happy Moondoggie (James Darren) and the big Kahuna (Cliff Robertson), the latter the prototype of the surf bum who roams the globe in search of the endless summer. The film actually kicked off the great boom in surfing popularity (the Beach Boys and theBeach Partymovies followed), much to the chagrin of purists. It was based on a novel by Frederick Kohner, who was inspired by his daughter's experiences.Gidget Goes Hawaiian(1961) puts Deborah Walley in the title role. She's no Sandra Dee, but at least there are shots of Walley doing her own surfing stunts. The action's in Waikiki, and Gidge is pursued by a confused Moondoggie and a famous dancer. They are played by James Darren and Michael Callan, and having the two 1960s male ingenues in the same movie suggests a weird collision of matter and anti-matter. The spark goes flat inGidget Goes to Rome(1963), with yet another new actress (Cindy Carol) paired with a loyal James Darren. It's closer toThree Coins in the Fountainthan the sandy beaches of Malibu.DVD caveat:  none of the films is in widescreen. The sequels don't suffer much, but the originalGidgetwas shot in CinemaScope, and the pan-and-scan approach hurts the summery look of the picture--even if it's just Sandra Dee balancing in front of blue-screen waves.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000XT1P5C", "B00JAD6BYW", "B000PMFRXS", "B000JU8HBA", "B005ET4NHI", "B005966N06", "B0006D3HCY", "B00023P4RO", "B00023P4RE", "B000P2A22O", "B0007R4T0I", "B00008CMRN", "B001HSNTKW", "B00AEFY8ZE", "B00AEFXK44", "B00F1FVJF4", "0425179621", "B00DJYKEQ4", "B004KN3NXE", "B0009X75WE", "B0007TKHFW", "B00CZ7AL32", "B005IX3C90", "B001QYY4JM", "B00005N89L", "B009L4DSV4", "B0000714BT", "B008FYZHPG", "B00007GZR1", "B0007QS2ZC", "B00I8SBYUQ", "B0007QS30G", "B006H37P5C", "B00009IB1F", "B005ETAW7S", "B00EL6ABL2", "B001PO54V0", "B00005JMVV", "B001DJLD1C", "B00IPL2CP2", "B001TKUXVQ", "B00083FZFE", "B000QUUD56", "B00007GZZW", "B00AEBB98W", "B00IO8UO74", "B00E5N8SMA", "B001LPWGGY", "0767827651", "B000JJSJPK", "B008H6GHG0", "B003G7DSF8", "B003B3V0O8", "B000MGBLPK", "B000JYW5B4", "B00DTISNBI", "0790785366", "B005DDN51A", "B0000CDRW3", "B0002B15Y2", "B00005JLJC", "B000PC8AL4", "B00C3ALLFS", "B000BITUZC", "B007TYI7YQ", "B001O2UTRW", "B004CLYJEQ", "B000B5XOZC", "B005BUA1F8", "B0007QS2Z2", "B00BX8A93Q", "B004VUK91K", "B0000648ZP", "B00AEFXYOA", "B000JJSJPA", "B00003Q433", "B006A8XGXE", "B000EHQU08", "B005EXA8P0", "B000FSMEB0", "B00DDT0JB0", "B0045HCJJY", "B0045HCJ80", "B006A8XFIK", "B00AMEZDK6", "B00AEBB8OC", "B000056MMM", "B003HKN52K", "B00B58FVBY", "B001SLNPSO", "B001D2WUCA", "B0000CDRW2", "B00AEFY5TI", "B00FM4S8IU", "B0030BS1E8", "B00G5N6C8U", "B00IF0KAYS", "B00BTYU3ZS", "0767810856", "B0063FGG9U"], "bought_together": ["B000XT1P5C", "B00JAD6BYW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00JAD6BYW", "B000XT1P5C", "B000PMFRXS", "B006H37P5C"]}, "price": 14.77, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 4471}, "asin": "B000286S2E", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51SCP0Q1P5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Complete Gidget Collection (Gidget / Gidget Goes Hawaiian / Gidget Goes to Rome)"}
{"description": "Declared \"luminously beautiful\" by the New York Times, Andrey Zvyagintsev's The Return is a stunning mixture of visionary allegory, urgent suspense and road movie momentum. Zvyagintsev's equal skill with lush visuals, lucid storytelling and breathtaking realism easily netted The Return the prestigious Golden Lion and the Best First Feature Film Award at the Venice International Film Festival.  Within the emotional vacuum of a fatherless childhood, young brothers Andrei (Vladimir Garin) and Ivan (Ivan Dobronravov) have grown closer than most siblings. But when they least expect it, the father the boys have never known returns. Under the cool midnight sun of a coastal Russian summer, Andrei and Ivan eagerly hop into a car for a week long fishing trip with a complete stranger they desperately need to believe is their father. but as they travel deeper into the Russian wilderness, their journey devolves from vacation to boot camp to father-sons love triangle and ultimately to a test of wills that pushes to the brink of violence. As it dawns on the boys that the man who could be their father might be trying to abandon, exploit or kill them, The Return's Jungian landscape gives way to fervid Freudian rage, shocking loss and bittersweet redemption.  Harried as one of the most auspicious film debuts since Badlands or The 400 Blows, The Return is both a gorgeous contemporary thriller and an astute updating of vanguard Soviet filmmaking. Disturbing, tender, transcendent, The Return's skillful marriage of psychological complexity to mythic imagery effortlessly evokes the watershed films of Andrei Tarkovsky and Roman Polanski.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000K2UEDG", "B00280QNK6", "B00019G4TQ", "B000RTCSIQ", "B000LTTOOS", "B004XVMCLC", "B0000633SD", "B00008ZZ9M", "B00006LPEK", "B0022RVO18", "B008MZTKFG", "B003OXGW5M", "B0000DGKI7", "B00009MEKP", "B000LV6OHQ", "B003VWR1XI", "B00003CXF4", "B0000633SB", "B00006JO77", "B000NQRDZG", "B00005QFE6", "6305257450", "B002BWP4A6", "B000I8OOG0", "6305744114", "B0000BWVCR", "B002QP145C", "B001MPS7GG", "B001PCNZEU", "B000B58DIA", "B0087OULO6", "B003MTAZCO", "B00HVOFP6W", "B006ML50YC", "B006IW8E3Y", "B004VH65A2", "B00009NHAT", "B000WS6YAA", "B0000ALPJ2", "B001UE49BQ", "B000EANSXM", "B00GMV8B1G", "B001H30Q08", "B000OVLBGC", "B00H0EN948", "B0001LJCAW", "B00019G4RS", "B000TGCR38", "B00006LPEH", "B001QOZYRS", "B000I8OOHE", "B000OCY7JE", "B0000C2IQA", "B000K7VHQO", "B00HRJVHEK", "B000PKG6OO", "B00151QYE4", "B0036TGSJE", "B002U4F5W2", "B00GA9F2PI", "B007FEHA0C", "B00IGK6TH4", "B0016K3988", "B000V7HFL4", "B00023P4N8", "B00AXYZZ6C", "B0002DB52M", "6305131104", "B00006LPER", "B00031TYGW", "B000EHQU30", "B009XTF8NI", "B000FZEU0G", "B0000YEDM2", "B001CW7ZT4", "B009CSVQ8Q", "B006ML50S8", "B0048FQFFM", "B0019T0JAW", "B004SIP6GI", "B00GPPXNLC", "B004GNBBVO", "B00EO2I6S8", "5489003219", "B000A5044C", "B00A8QDI1Y", "B00005N8A9", "B00H91LWBY", "B0000714AW", "B00065GX0K", "6305899681", "B005LAIIIK", "B000BC8SWE", "B00000F3CD", "B002U1LGSW", "B0000DJYNI", "B000G0O5IM", "B00005JLQW", "B000BMY2NS", "B004G8QO7U"], "bought_together": ["B00280QNK6", "B000K2UEDG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000RTCSIQ", "B000K2UEDG", "B000LTTOOS", "B00280QNK6"]}, "price": 18.46, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 82114}, "asin": "B0002KQOH6", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51BBQQ48J2L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Return"}
{"description": "The beautiful and wonderfully named Giovanna Mezzogiorno joins the list of soulful Italian actresses withFacing Windows, a pleasant cinematic fancy. Her character is a married Mom in an ordinary apartment, whose life is affected by two things:  her fascination with the handsome man who lives across the courtyard, and the sudden arrival in her home of an elderly amnesiac (played by the late Massimo Girotti)--a well-dressed man found walking on the street, dazed and lost. Turkish-born director Ferzan Ozpetek (Steam: The Turkish Bath) makes this simultaneously a slice of life and a vaguely fantastical situation. It probably all works out a little too neatly, but the unhurried pace and deep sympathy Ozpetek displays toward his main characters is refreshing. And when in doubt, he points the camera at the face of La Mezzogiorno, which solves all problems.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000C1VB8M", "B00598OA2C", "B000FUF6SQ", "B0000C23T0", "B004P0IRHE", "B003U4H0CE", "B0018O50VG", "B00CTHOEV8", "B004XVMCLW", "B003JHXS8C", "B0006JMLVQ", "B00003CXXY", "B000I0RNV6", "B000CR8QV6", "B00HRJVHEK", "B005P2BLC4", "B000FWHW68", "B00AIXVV9I", "B003IISTD6", "B001B94K3W", "B0026IQTQS", "B000ELJA6U", "B007AFBYTO", "B00006ADG1", "B00HE010QM", "B0043CT9E4", "B002JTMNZ0", "B004R4PWYY", "B0019X3YT6", "B005GP7F5W", "B00124SNIO", "B00124SNIY", "B0011FLH14", "B00005JMIJ", "B0000AEUJA", "B000NY1EAS", "B000X418UY", "B00HHYF5EI", "B004XVMCKI", "B000ARXG0E", "B008B9JSD2", "B004D45NZG", "B00GWWV1XU", "B000E40PYS", "B000E33W0I", "B00006LPER", "B0040BJH2M", "B002VECLXC", "6305081034", "B000B58DI0", "B006IW8E3Y", "B000MRNWFQ", "B001DB6J82", "B0000DZ3BJ", "B00009ME9Z", "B008A1AKK6", "B0064NLRG8", "B002M2T1VI", "B00007KQ9X", "B00005Y6XU", "B000021Y77", "B004KDYR2A", "B003OXSRW8", "B002TZS5GA", "B0002DB4YQ", "B005STGM1O", "B00005JLQW", "B004MOJW0E", "B000EQ5Q2W", "B0045ZAQSM", "B000FSMEE2", "B00008976W", "B004L03B3S", "B00005QFE6", "B001CIOCLC", "B002ONC9NC", "B005V4X8PO", "B00996RSYM", "B0000CE684", "B00B2DGYQS", "B000274TLW", "B0033PQUXA", "B0006J27WO", "B0036TGSJE", "B0002JZT5A", "B008KJVKPW", "B0016GIAJ0", "B001EASNTK", "0139536396", "B00009IB5B", "B0048LPRDW", "B0007OP1YE", "B000087EYH", "B000ERVKOE", "B004RCC6XG", "B001ABRBHI", "B00008PBYZ", "B000EMGF26", "B0002TT08W", "B0006ZW6VU"], "bought_together": ["B000FUF6SQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000FUF6SQ", "B004XVMCLW", "B00598OA2C", "B003U4H0CE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 120895}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 20.39, "brand": "", "asin": "B0002XNSYU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516D4Y79P2L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Facing Windows"}
{"description": "Truth, identity, and responsibility are the cornerstones ofSmallville's exceptional third season. When viewers left Clark (Tom Welling) at the end ofseason 2, he was feeling his oats in Metropolis with the help of a red Kryptonite ring, but by the opening of season 3, he must return to Smallville to not only help his parents save their farm, but seek some resolution in his relationships with Lana (Kristin Kreuk) and Lex (Michael Rosenbaum), who's returned from his abandonment at the conclusion of the previous season. Lex himself must deal with some shocking revelations regarding his relationship with his sinister father Lionel (John Glover, magnetic as always), and Lana becomes involved with a new figure in town, the mysterious Adam Knight (Lost's Ian Somerholder), who may or may not be a certain caped crusader. And speaking of heroes in disguise, the season's finale introduces Kara, a young woman with powers similar to Clark's--could she in fact be his sister, known best to comic book fans as Supergirl? Season 3 is chock full of such intriguing moments, including an appearance by futureDaily Planeteditor Perry White (Michael McKean, the real-life husband of series star Annette O'Toole) in \"Perry,\" helmed bySupergirlfilm director Jeannot Szwarc; the return of villains Jonathan Taylor Thomas, Shawn Ashmore, and Jesse Metcalfe from seasons 1 and 2 (in \"Asylum\"); the departure of series regular Samuel L. Jones; and a intrigue-fraught final turn by Christopher Reeve as Dr. Swann (\"Legacy\").The boxed set matches the high quality of the season with some terrific extras, including commentary on three episodes by series creators Alfred Gough and Miles Millar, along with Rosenbaum, Allison Mack (Chloe), and Glover. Gough and Millar also contribute commentary to a battery of deleted scenes, and Mack's \"Chloe Chronicles\" returns for another go-round. The supplemental features are rounded out by a behind-the-scenes featurette, an amusing gag reel, and an Easter egg with Rosenbaum conducting some offbeat interviews.--Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0009A5MUO", "B0001JXPPC", "B000G1R4SO", "B000N6SE4U", "B000X5SMXY", "B00005JLKB", "B001FB4VZS", "B002JVWRDQ", "B003L77GG0", "B006CR2ON6", "B000R206FK", "B001FB4W02", "B0012U7IWU", "B002JVWRE0", "B003L77GGA", "B00G4SCOJW", "B00080ZG2O", "B00G4SCKAK", "B00BBXSPCK", "B00BBXSPES", "B00BGI086Q", "B00260HH30", "B000BT96EG", "B000P6XQ50", "B004EXNHO0", "B00DTRR43W", "B001DJLD2G", "B002N5N5MK", "B00DX88IL4", "B004PHSTTS", "B000FP2OPY", "B00G7QPX6C", "B0018CWEYY", "B000J10EQU", "1419826670", "B000PE0G0A", "B00JF5G8WU", "B0000640T0", "B00CN009Y2", "B001FB4W0C", "B002DQL34G", "B00F4FFO8E", "B00280LZAE", "B000EHSVM8", "B00915G6OE", "B0049IHWYG", "B001MVWRNE", "B0041QSZ7O", "B005SH63HO", "B000SMNL92", "B008JFUPFI", "B000X5SPBI", "B002FGUHBE", "B009LDCXNY", "B005PYKVRI", "B004SEUIWY", "B00ED2IBXE", "B00066FBQQ", "B00K7IPFSM", "B0051SFSAS", "B00915G6SU", "B000BT96FA", "B000HLDF9U", "B000F8O2P6", "B000A5046K", "B000O77SMW", "B0019LY5IM", "B000F8O2OW", "B00915G6TE", "B00EIL7E9C", "B003L77GGK", "B000R7GKQE", "B00B5J6A7W", "B00K7IPGS6", "B004LROMWU", "B00DYEN6XC", "B00023E88U", "B003ITZBVS", "B000B8384G", "B000CCBC9O", "B000I0QLS2", "B009LDD626", "B0025KVKDE", "B001C8W7EQ", "B00GTZWUPS", "B0002CX1M0", "B001MVWRN4", "1401210600", "B004HW7JNS", "1401234860", "B00IYRLUAU", "B00JPS6A3O", "B0072OFM28", "B004EPZ084", "B002JVWRAO", "B00915G6NK", "B00BEJL6JK", "B00JPS7HOA", "B005QET8FS", "B00CPEK3NI"], "bought_together": ["B0009A5MUO", "B0001JXPPC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0001JXPPC", "B0009A5MUO", "B000N6SE4U", "B000G1R4SO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 10632}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 29.69, "brand": "WEA", "asin": "B0002Y0QV2", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51FG3cFcvQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Smallville: Season 3"}
{"description": "Carniv&#xE0;ledoesn't waste any time making its--wildly ambitious--aims clear. As carnival manager Samson (Michael J. Anderson,Twin Peaks' diminutive backwards-talker) notes in pilot episode \"Milfay,\" directed by Rodrigo Garc&#xED;a (son of Gabriel Garc&#xED;a Marquez), \"To each generation [is] born a creature of light and a creature of darkness.\" With that the story begins. The year is 1934, the setting the Oklahoma dustbowl. In short order, Ben Hawkins (In the Bedroom's Nick Stahl) loses his mother and his home. He's poor, he's alone--he needs a job. So he joins Samson's carnival, en route to the West. Hawkins, naturally, is the good guy. Waiting for him in California is the not so good Brother Justin Crowe (Clancy Brown,The Shawshank Redemption), a fire and brimstone preacher with supernatural powers and a fiercely loyal sister (Amy Madigan). Hawkins, as it turns out, has similar powers....Created by Daniel Knauf (Wolf Lake),Carniv&#xE0;lefeels like David Lynch (weird, slow, occasionally kinky), plays likeAmerican Gothic(Shaun Cassidy's cult series about a good kid and an evil sheriff), and looks like John Ford'sGrapes of Wrath. It features one of television's most colorful casts of characters. They include Sophie (Clea DuVall), who reads fortunes--with her comatose mother's assistance, the vaguely sinister Lodz (Patrick Bauchau), blind absinthe-drinker and mentalist (he can see both the future and the past), and Ruthie (Adrienne Barbeau), snake charmer, strongman's mother, and all-around maternal figure. By the final episode of the season (\"The Day That Was the Day\"), also directed by Garc&#xED;a, one of these characters will be dead.Carniv&#xE0;lewon five richly deserved technical Emmys for its first year, including awards for cinematography and art direction.

{"description": "The bonus material is comprised of nine 4-6 minutes featurettes on various aspects of the production, giving insight on how the selection of director Paul Greengrass--with his documentary, impromptu methods--led to the film's much-talked-about style. The most interesting are about how they blow up things (without a computer) and a look at the Go Mobile, a new rig to capture a car chase on film. Even though it's not listed on the packaging, there is a commentary track with the director (uninteresting as it is). Something that is listed on the package, \"Explosive Deleted Scenes,\" is really about 7 minutes of ho-hum expository scenes.

{"description": "Slick, stylish, and fast-paced,Las Vegasis a high-tech hybrid of 1970s'Vega$and 1980s'Hotel. Created by Gary Scott Thompson (The Fast and the Furious), season 1 includes all 23 episodes of the NBC dramedy's. Set in the fictional Montecito Resort and Casino, the show revolves around surveillance expert and ex-Marine Danny McCoy (Josh Duhamel,Win a Date with Tad Hamilton). McCoy reports to the president of operations and ex-CIA operative \"Big\" Ed Deline (the inimitable James Caan). If Duhamel is the show's charisma, Caan is thegravitas. The attractive cast is rounded out by Vanessa Marcil as casino host Sam Marquez, Nikki Cox as event coordinator Mary Connell, James Lesure as valet Mike Cannon, Marsha Thomason as pit boss Nessa Holt, Cheryl Ladd as Deline's wife Jillian, and model Molly Sims as Deline's daughter Delinda.From the start,Las Vegashas attracted a diverse array of guest stars, from musicians, like Little Richard (\"New Orleans\"), to movie stars, like Sean \"Samwise\" Astin (\"You Can't Take It With You\"). Even \"Mr. Las Vegas\" himself, Wayne Newton, puts in an appearance (\"Pros and Cons\"). Other notable guests include Elliot Gould (\"Jokers and Fools\"), Jean-Claude Van Damme (\"Die Fast, Die Furious\"), and Alec Baldwin (\"Hellraisers and Heartbreakers\"), hot off his Oscar-nominated turn inThe Cooler.First used in heist hitOcean's 11, Elvis Presley's \"A Little Less Conversation\" (JXL remix) is theLas Vegastheme song. On the DVD set, however, it's replaced by \"Let It Ride\" on all episodes except the pilot. Also, the subtitle \"Uncut and Uncensored\" indicates footage too hot for network TV, but the additions are minor.

{"description": "Like James Bond--but without the high-tech gadgets--Angus MacGyver (Richard Dean Anderson) is one of those rare beings who can avert any crisis without mussing a hair. (The rest of us should be so lucky.) In the pilot alone, the secret agent dismantles a missile using a paper clip and fashions a rocket thruster out of a pistol. Is there anything MacGyver can't do? As the first season of ABC's long-running adventure series proves, the answer is a resounding no. MacGyver's secret: the everyday items he \"finds along the way,\" like matches or gum wrappers, and the ingenuity to put them to a myriad of uses (a background in physics and chemistry doesn't hurt). UnlikeAlias' Sidney Bristow, he isn't a multi-linguist, a martial artist, or a master of disguises. Wits are MacGyver's weapon of choice.Produced by Henry Winkler (Arrested Development),The Complete First Seasonincludes all 22 episodes from 1985-1986 (alas, there are no extras). MacGyver is joined by Phoenix Foundation director of operations Pete Thornton (Dana Elcar), who is introduced in \"Nightmares.\" Also, his grandfather, Harry Jackson (John Anderson), makes his first appearance in \"Target MacGyver,\" while friend Penny Parker (Teri Hatcher ofDesperate Housewives) makes hers in \"Every Time She Smiles\" (they will appear more frequently in future seasons). Other notable guest stars include Joan Chen (The Last Emperor) in \"The Golden Triangle,\" Nana Visitor (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine) in \"Hellfire,\" and John De Lancie (Star Trek: The Next Generation) in \"The Escape.\"MacGyverran for seven seasons and was followed by two made-for-TV movies in 1994,Lost Treasure of AtlantisandTrail to Doomsday. In 1997, after a short-lived series for UPN (1995'sLegend), Anderson landed the lead in an even longer-running series,Stargate SG-1, based on the sci-fi extravaganza with Kurt Russell.--Kathleen C.

{"description": "A big, bruising epic of the Korean War,Tae Guk Gismashed box-office records when it played in South Korea in 2004, almost as though the country needed to re-live the trauma at a 50-year distance. For the rest of the world,  this movie looks like a ground-level reckoning in a melodramatic key, with an authentic feel for battle lines as well as home front.Tae Guk Gifollows two brothers--one uneducated and forceful, the other intellectual and reserved--as they are united and then divided by the conflict. The broadly emotional story has some of the power of tales of the American Civil War, when family members found themselves on opposite sides of a battle. Director Kang Je-gyu , who made the lively female-assassin hitShiri, takes a blunt approach to the material (including aSaving Private Ryan-style framing device). And at 150 minutes, he has plenty of time for head-splitting, blood-spraying combat. This movie is meant as a punch in the stomach, and it connects.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0076XTIWU", "B007S0DCUU", "B003OXGW5M", "B004LE4FKM", "B008645YLM", "B0076XTFF0", "B006C1S1DY", "B007S0DB56", "B004H2CXBQ", "B004SJVQ4I", "B0009NZ78I", "B002QP145C", "B00C6WHPO4", "B00BTFK014", "B005E2YL3Q", "B00005AVZU", "B00A3TFMDI", "B0009S2T0M", "B00C2535TE", "B000NVT0RU", "B007WXUVHU", "B003Y7F1IW", "B0000633R6", "B005ZMBEXA", "B004GNBBVO", "B00D3XMA9A", "B00CLH09UQ", "B003JDQJM8", "B008645Z0M", "B0002J4X20", "B000GBEWNY", "B003NLE5JA", "B000BGH2A4", "B00BC1UPRO", "B003OXSRWI", "B00CG0YLS4", "B00CHYSSME", "B0019PL2W0", "B0099SI178", "B0030A6ICG", "B005OTGS4E", "B008OTTRE4", "B00A705TOU", "B0009XRZQK", "B00AN5LCOA", "B00D3XM7H0", "B005DKS1TE", "B0046YK4KW", "B00CAT3T8Y", "B004H2IMSO", "B0015DLZXM", "B00005U8F4", "B003EYEEI8", "B00005R87B", "B002C6VMIY", "B004P2VQZ2", "B00598YUOK", "B0011FDVGI", "B009VL2AZM", "B000E1EHPE", "B0035JHYHA", "B002P7UCJK", "B0051SFTGQ", "B005HG8VE4", "B000GSYRY6", "B001KEHAEE", "B009XTF8NI", "B00IVLR9JA", "B000P7V4MG", "B000A1OFZA", "B00HRYH52I", "B00772M1D8", "B007HCI42A", "B0009UKV5U", "B000GSE6H4", "B003PMWF62", "B00ENTX7JU", "9713727150", "B00576U9HQ", "B00ID8HATK", "B0001611CO", "B006UTDH6O", "B0000BWVCR", "B000E3LD5E", "B000PKG8TW", "B0082SIGR6", "B00ALCBTWU", "B003DVB7F0", "B00080ETYA", "B00CBDG4UY", "B004TXFFI6", "B000MGBLIC", "B00J5G1P2W", "B0036TGSV2", "B00004STDA", "B000MRA542", "B0014CKCE2", "B00C6WHSRI", "0792841662", "B005HQBO9I"], "bought_together": ["B007S0DCUU", "B0076XTIWU"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B007S0DCUU", "B0076XTIWU", "B004LE4FKM", "B00BC1UPRO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 35302}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 10.25, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B0006VL1J2", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51K30W34ZFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Tae Guk Gi - The Brotherhood of War"}
{"description": "Make no mistake,Clone Warsis honest-to-goodness authenticStar Wars. The animated \"microseries\" takes place betweenEpisode II, Attack of the ClonesandEpisode III, Revenge of the Sith. If the feature films cover the beginning and end of the war,Clone Warsdepicts the actual battles and events that made heroes into legends. Don't expect too much character development, as the episodes tend to be driven more by flat-out action than by dialogue (which can be a good thing, considering someStar Warsdialogue). We see such familiar faces as Obi-Wan Kenobi, Yoda, and Mace Windu in combat, and we meet the elite ARC (Advanced Recon Commandos) clone troopers plus new Jedi--the amphibious Kit Fisto and two women, Luminara Unduli and Barriss Offee. We also see a little more development of Anakin--showing off the best pilot skills in the army, defying Obi-Wan, and engaging in a deadly duel with Sith apprentice Asajj Ventress. But just when it's clear that the Separatist droid armies are no match for a Jedi, the tide begins to turn with the introduction of the menacing General Grievous, who plays a crucial part inEpisode III. The cast mostly consists of veteran voice actors, but Anthony Daniels does appear as C-3PO.Clone Warswas created by Genndy Tartakovsky, whose resume includes such stylish series asSamurai Jack,Dexter's Laboratory, andThe Powerpuff Girls, and the program won a 2004 Emmy for Outstanding Animated Program (For Programming One Hour or More). These 20 episodes, which played on the Cartoon Network (and were originally designated seasons 1 and 2), can be viewed as a seamless 69-minute whole or as individual chapters. DVD features include two commentary tracks, a making-of featurette, video game andEpisode IIItrailers, and an Xbox playable demo of the stealth gameRepublic Commando. If you're a fan who can't wait forEpisode III,Clone Warsis essential viewing.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000BCE8Q4", "B001GQSY5K", "B001GQSY64", "B00E8G5H0K", "B00E8G5HFA", "B009OAWMLM", "B0002YCUPC", "B0002YCUQ6", "B00005JLXH", "B00006HBUJ", "B0026IBRRO", "B00003CX5P", "B005J9ZFWK", "B00E8G5HDW", "B0057UA4FY", "B00KH57UXS", "0345511298", "B004LROMT8", "B0002YCUR0", "B00FX58Y9Q", "B008FTX6OU", "1465408738", "B004JMF00K", "B000FAGGWQ", "1783291044", "1593079117", "B001PO53IO", "B00E9PMML2", "1595826122", "B000FQJAIW", "B00E8G5H6Y", "1616616806", "B00AXFK96M", "B007GMKWYE", "B0089BSMKM", "1465420800", "1616552271", "B00KUS5YGC", "B00K0MM4AM", "1616555513", "B00JMXWQ30", "B004LROMU2", "B00003CXCT", "B001E533E0", "B0001HAI0E", "B00K7IPGS6", "B003ZSJ212", "B005CSYQ2S", "B00APGRMX2", "B007TM7Z6O", "1595826998", "B0044E9JTG", "B007IKKSNY", "0345477642", "B000W4TGIQ", "1616552514", "B0012EM5CY", "1593076800", "1593076789", "B00005RCQJ", "B000J3O194", "B00KHA88PC", "1595822283", "B00027CXEM", "0345493346", "0811868893", "B000JLTR86", "B000F4RH8E", "B00008DHNZ", "B008FTXQ8G", "1452102279", "B000067DPK", "B00004TN2T", "0756682533", "1595828664", "1569719624", "B003F7WLAM", "1593078307", "B00GZ0ML4C", "B00HMOW9YM", "B005KR6NOK", "0553296124", "1593073070", "1593072430", "B000VDDDVE", "1595829539", "1595829474", "1419714007", "0345435419", "B001CT05VC", "0590519336", "1595828028", "B0072BNK02", "B00HXH0102", "0590519220", "0761178104", "6305869103", "B002ABVLZA"], "bought_together": ["B000BCE8Q4", "B001GQSY5K"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001GQSY5K", "B00E8G5H0K", "B000BCE8Q4", "B0057UA4FY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 24277}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 34.5, "brand": "", "asin": "B0006Z2LMO", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51A6GEB6SAL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Star Wars: Clone Wars - Volume One"}

{"description": "As the saying goes, \"If it ain't broke, don't fix it,\" and the second season ofThe Golden Girlspicks up where the first ended. The same classic quartet--Blanche, Rose, Dorothy, and Sophia--is back, along with their snappy retorts, shoulder pads, and cheesecake. Well, there was one change. In the season premiere, \"End of the Curse,\" Blanche (Rue McClanahan) goes through menopause.Highlights of the 26 episodes include \"Ladies of the Evening,\" featuring a cameo from Burt Reynolds, just a few years prior to his own network sitcom,Evening Shade. As Blanche exclaims, \"Mr. Burt Reynolds is one of our finest living actors...I mean, you put Sir Laurence Olivier inCannonball Run--see what he can do.\" Then there's \"Isn't It Romantic?\" with Lois Nettleton (In the Heat of the Night) as Dorothy's lesbian friend, Jean, who falls for an unsuspecting Rose (Betty White). As was often the case, a sensitive subject is handled with taste and humor and resulted in an Emmy nomination for Nettleton's performance.Further highlights include a white-wigged Nancy Walker (The Mary Tyler Moore Show,Rhoda) as Sophia's long-lost sister, Angela, in \"The Sisters\" and \"Long Day's Journey Into Marinara,\" and a pompadoured George Clooney (ER) in \"To Catch a Neighbor.\" The final episode ofThe Golden Girlssecond season, \"Empty Nest,\" features David Leisure and Oscar winner-Rita Moreno (West Side Story) and sets the scene for creator Susan Harris's 1988 spin-off,Empty Nest(although only Leisure would segue to the new show, whileSoap's Richard Mulligan would take over for Moreno).--Kathleen C.

{"description": "While 2003'sDaredevilwas a conventional superhero movie, the 2005 spinoff,Elektra, is more of awuxia-styled martial arts/fantasy flick. Elektra (Jennifer Garner) has returned to her life as a hired assassin, but she balks at an assignment to kill a single father (Goran Visnjic,ER) and his teenage daughter (Kirsten Prout). That makes her the target of the Hand, an organization of murderous ninjas, scheming corporate types, and a band of stylish supervillains seeking to eliminate Elektra and tip the balance of power in the ongoing battle of good vs. evil.As the star ofAlias, Garner has proven that she can kick butt with the best of them, and some of the visual effects are impressive, but the action sequences tend to be anticlimactic, and there's not much to the story. Fans will notice numerous references toFrank Miller's comic books, but there's very little resemblance to Miller's cold-blooded killer (Elektra with an agent? Elektra referring to herself as a \"soccer mom\"?).IsElektrabetter thanDaredevil? Not really, even with the distinct advantage of having all Garner and no Ben Affleck. That could be the spinoff's greatest disappointment: afterSpider-Man 2raised the bar for comic-book movies,Elektralowered it back toDaredevil's level.  Directed by Rob Bowman (theX-Filesmovie), and featuring Terence Stamp as the mysterious mentor Stick, Will Yun Lee (Die Another Day) as the chief villain, and NFL-player-turned-mixed-martial-arts-champion Bob Sapp as the immovable Stone.DVD featuresBen Affleck's much-rumored cameo is one of the deleted scenes on theElektraDVD.  It's a one-minute throwaway, and while he's supposedly appearing as Matt Murdock (who romanced Elektra inDaredevil), the barrage of celebrity gossip makes it impossible to see him as anything other than Jennifer Garner's real-life boyfriend.  There's also a making-of featurette, which is mostly promotional hype other than a few interesting effects shots; four editing featurettes; and Jennifer Garner's videotaped message to ComicCon.--David HoriuchiMore onElektraElektra: The Album(Soundtrack CD)Elektra: The Movie(Comic Adaptation)Frank Miller Comic BooksDaredevil(Director's Cut) (DVD)Jennifer Garner stars inAlias(DVD)More Superhero DVDs", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000959N0", "B000VI70QS", "B00005JNTU", "B0006L0LOS", "B000FGGE68", "B001QB9H1U", "B001CDR1FG", "B000OVLBF8", "B00AEFXCLU", "B0002IQMAM", "B005LAIGW8", "B001DHXT20", "B004EPZ07K", "B001F7MSFM", "B001GCUO1Q", "B0009A409S", "B008JFUS0U", "B002GSXKNI", "B00E5I2MEK", "B004LWZW42", "B0007V6ITE", "B000UR9T8C", "B001AK3S4Y", "B00K7IPFSM", "B00E5I2MCM", "078401132X", "B00E5I2M9K", "B00005JM5B", "B0090SI56Y", "B00005JKWJ", "B004LWZWFQ", "B0002KVUKM", "B000HCO83Q", "B003YOZNBU", "B000J10EQU", "B00003CXZ1", "B00E5I2M6I", "B000AYELVU", "B00005JMQW", "B008JFUO72", "B003Y5H5EW", "B000HEVZ9E", "B000AYELVA", "B000VI28Z6", "B00JL6L4UY", "B009MO57H6", "B00AEFYGBA", "B002ZG99B8", "B0083SBMBM", "B001CC7PKS", "B00005JKCH", "B0007WFX62", "B0006IIPIK", "6307397594", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B0009MDPYM", "B001OQCVI8", "B00JPS7HOA", "0780624890", "B00F4FFO8E", "B002GSXKN8", "B008JFUPFI", "B00IKM5LXG", "B00177Y9ZC", "B003YAR97K", "B002ZG98UA", "B002NXSRVG", "B000EQHXN2", "B001RHGRT8", "B00IZZDWKM", "B001GZ6QC4", "B004LWZWGA", "B0021L8V0M", "B000VR0570", "1558908846", "B001HN697M", "B00005JLYW", "B008JFURII", "B001MVWRNE", "B001FB55HQ", "B005LAII44", "B00A2H9OSK", "B001QTXM5Y", "B002ZG983M", "B00BTYMPUY", "B002U4UZSQ", "B001QB9H2E", "B002ZG99G8", "B005G4TJUC", "B0012RLX88", "B003Q6D2B4", "B00195FUDC", "B008Y1YK9Y", "B001OQCUZM", "B00HMVJB0K", "B002ZG98N2", "B00005JNJV", "B004SIP9Z6", "B000K7UBSO", "B00HEPDGKA"], "bought_together": ["B0002XVQNU", "B000VI70QS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005JLXE", "B0090SI56Y", "B00979KQAO", "B000VI28Z6"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 23534}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.99, "brand": "TCFHE", "asin": "B0007P0Y7C", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51R5W%2BoU9CL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Elektra (Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "If you spliced Charles Addams, Dr. Seuss, Charles Dickens, Edward Gorey, and Roald Dahl into a Tim Burtonesque landscape, you'd surely come up with something likeLemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events. Many critics (in mostly mixed reviews) wondered why Burton didn't direct this comically morbid adaptation of thefirst three booksin the popular series by Daniel Handler (a.k.a. \"Lemony Snicket,\" played here by Jude Law and seen only in silhouette) instead of TV andCasperveteran Brad Silberling, but there's still plenty to recommend the playfully bleak scenario, in which three resourceful orphans thwart their wicked, maliciously greedy relative Count Olaf (Jim Carrey), who subjects them to... well, a series of unfortunate events. Along the way they encounter a herpetologist uncle (Billy Connolly), an anxious aunt (Meryl Streep) who's afraid ofeverything, and a variety of fantastical hazards and mysterious clues, some of which remain unresolved. Given endless wonders of art direction, costume design, and cinematography, Silberling's direction is surprisingly uninspired (in other words, the books are better), but when you add a throwaway cameo by Dustin Hoffman, Law's amusing narration, and Carrey's over-the-top antics, the firstLemonymovie suggests a promising franchise in the making.--Jeff ShannonA Message from Count OlafDear Adoring Fan of Count Olaf,Perhaps once every thousand years, a talent emerges that completely changes the way movies are made, orphans are orphaned, and heartthrobs throb. Often this talent has only one eyebrow, as is the case with one of the most cherished and admired actors scheming today. Surely you can you guess of whom I think.No, you fool! I am referring to the One...the Only...the Unbelievably Handsome Count Olaf!Or, as I like to call him, Me.If you&#x92;ve already seen my performance in Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events, you must still be speechless. But if you haven&#x92;t, you are in serious danger. Just teasing. But you could be after I send one of my gifted henchpersons to your home!So why not get my movie on DVD? This major motion spectacle has everything. Me, acting! Leeches, attacking! Orphans, almost falling off a cliff! Of course, if you are familiar with books by Lemony Snicket, you know that they include all of these things too, but most of what he says is lies, and the rest is completely boring.There's never been a film that demands repeated viewing in quite the same way, with a diabolical genius writing you a letter that says, \"I DEMAND REPEATED VIEWING!!!\" Plus with DVD extras, you&#x92;ll get at least 20% more Olaf for your money. And... just for you, for an unlimited time only, I&#x92;ll throw in Aunt Josephine free with purchase.*So, noble Amazonians, put down your hunting spears and exotic headdresses, and prepare to bask in True Greatness. Or, as I like to call it, Me.Of course you may have my autograph!Count Olaf*Count Olaf will not be held liable or accept blame in any way for any and all liability, loss, damage, or personal injury (including death), without limit and without regard once Aunt Josephine is thrown in, due to the unpredictable behavior of hungry leeches.Stills fromLemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events(Click to Enlarge)Violet, Count Olaf, and KlausAunt JosephineCount Olaf and Aunt JosephineDirecting Jim CarreyKlaus, Mr. Poe, Sunny, and VioletCount OlafOlaf AscendingThe Baudelaire OrphansAll Things SnicketSee a complete list of allLemony Snicket's creations, including books from theSeries of Unfortunate Events, calendars, and more.The Essential Lemony Snicket BooksA Series of Unfortunate Events: The Ominous Omnibus, Books 1-3The Situation Worsens: A Box of Unfortunate Events, Books 4-6The Dilemma Deepens: A Box of Unfortunate Events, Books 7-9The Slippery Slope: A Series of Unfortunate Events, Book 10The Grim Grotto: A Series of Unfortunate Events, Book 11A Library of Unfortunate Events, Books 1-10Behind the Scenes with Count Olaf: A Series of Unfortunate Events Movie BookLemony Snicket: The Unauthorized AutobiographyThe Puzzling PuzzlesActivity BookMore from the MovieOriginal Movie PosterSoundtrackWall PosterLemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate EventsComputer & Video GamesFor PS2For PCFor XboxFor GameCube", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEBB8KQ", "B001NPD9JA", "B000OYCM5I", "0061119067", "0061146331", "0061146315", "0061146307", "0064410161", "006055620X", "0060095563", "B0016Q2D5M", "B00009XUM5", "B0002W4UDE", "0064410153", "B00139W3NE", "0064408647", "0064407691", "0060586583", "B001LPWGBO", "0060839090", "0064410145", "B000Q66FB6", "B000G1R394", "B007R6DJP8", "006029809X", "B004M1A21K", "0060562250", "B000E8M0VA", "0064408655", "B0000VCZKW", "B00AEFZ6V4", "B00AEFY9RG", "B00AEBB8DI", "B000J10FLY", "0064410129", "B000GB5MH4", "B00AEFY8FO", "B001APZMJS", "0060566159", "B001HN694K", "0807219908", "B00H5NY7DQ", "B003HARV3Y", "B000C3L27U", "B0001I9YGW", "B004A8ZX3C", "0064408639", "B00005JPH2", "B00005JLOT", "B001DPHDCY", "0064408663", "B002ZG984Q", "B002ZG97F6", "0767836324", "B0000VCZKM", "B0000YTP02", "B005F96UJ6", "B000031EGV", "B00028HBES", "B003L20IJM", "B000M343BC", "B000ELJAEM", "B002WJI2QQ", "B002GHHHNS", "0783235070", "B004AKCME8", "B0000640SC", "B00081912E", "0807219916", "B000P0J09W", "B00IEXX4KS", "B0036TGSIK", "B00005JG6M", "0783225482", "B008QE9XD2", "B000QGDY0G", "B00AEFXJS6", "B000P0J0A6", "B00437IEI6", "6305123454", "B002JUFPX6", "B0006JMLRK", "B008JFUNTG", "B005LAIH4A", "B000AP04FG", "B0009NZ2KG", "B001QOGYAO", "B000BB1MI2", "B0014Z4OMU", "B000E6EHE0", "B002NZK5SW", "B00005JOWW", "0783219806"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0061146307", "B00AEBB8KQ", "B000OYCM5I", "0061119067"]}, "price": 13.47, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 48674}, "asin": "B0007PICAI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510HCJR3SCL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Lemony Snicket's a Series of Unfortunate Events (Full Screen Edition)"}

When Joe and one of the other men, Jed, go to retrieve the body of the fallen man, Jed feels an instant connection with Joe--one that, as the weeks go by, becomes ever more intense.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001EASNMW", "B008RO6PJQ", "B0002TSZHO", "B0006IUDTY", "B000HXDWH8", "B0009X7BDC", "0385494149", "B0068RHSCW", "6305847045", "B000LV6OJE", "B00439GWRE", "B000Y2Q9MM", "B00AEFXRRO", "B00005JMJD", "B000M341SC", "B004VK74A4", "B0007Y08QA", "B000060MWB", "B000GYI3D6", "B004U7EHJE", "B00005JPUN", "B0007NFLO0", "B00BTYXNPK", "B0002I8372", "B0068MNO4S", "B000934FC2", "B000PFU9QK", "B001PPLIEG", "B0009G3B0G", "B00HOGBXS6", "B000023VTP", "B0068RHSZO", "B000B5XOWK", "B0009W5IQ0", "B00D3DJIG8", "B004EQAVHI", "B000IFQLG4", "B00004TX5J", "B000291Q52", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B0000UJL82", "B00BSN0VZW", "B006JN87WK", "B0089XJXRQ", "B00139W3NE", "B000F1IQN2", "B005NHZALE", "B004VK742M", "B000EQHXNW", "B00B83OIVA", "B004RE29PO", "B0006GANOQ", "B004RE29T0", "B00AG472DS", "B000Q66Q8I", "B004EPYZSK", "B004LWZW7E", "B0034G4P4O", "1843585391", "B001PQPKEY", "1905287445"], "bought_together": ["B001EASNMW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005DJ7AYC", "B0009X7BDC", "0385494149", "6305847045"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 116597}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 42.99, "brand": "", "asin": "B0007R4TJ4", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51EEANYM3TL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Enduring Love (Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "\"Still great.\" These words, spoken by Raymond (Ray Romano) to his wife, Debra (Patricia Heaton) at the poignant conclusion of the flashback episode \"How They Met,\" help close outEverybody Loves Raymond's wonderful third season. He is referring not only to the hapless cook's lone signature dish, lemon chicken, but to their marriage as well. But he could just as well have been referring toRaymonditself. The Emmy-worthy ensemble (at this point, still losing out to theFrasierjuggernaut) are discovering new dimensions to their characters, and the show's writers are mining even more precious, intimately observed character-based comedy gold from the Barones' dysfunctional family life. Several episodes this season rank among the series' best, including \"How They Met\" and the totally whacked \"Robert's Date,\" in which Robert (Brad Garrett) desperately tries to fit in with his black partner and her friends. This is a pivotal season for Raymond's Eeyore-esque brother, who finally declares his independence and moves out of his parents' home and into his own apartment. This does not help his love life. In the hilarious episode \"Robert Moves Back,\" Robert and Amy (Monica Horan) at last consummate their relationship, but are devastated when they learn they were exposed through curtainless windows to the other tenants in Robert's building (\"You ruined our Bible study\"). For viewers with a strong investment in these characters, there are earth-rocking time capsule moments, as in \"The Visit,\" when Debra lashes out at her preoccupied mother that she wishes she were more involved in the family like Marie (Doris Roberts).What elevatesRaymondis that it is much more than just wisecracks and putdowns. The peerless cast deftly navigates the fine line between comedy and drama. \"Frank's Tribute\" concludes with a rare, touching moment between the verbally abusive Frank (Peter Boyle) and Marie in which he gently cradles her in his arms to remove cold cream from her face. At the conclusion of \"Driving Frank,\" the road accident-prone Frank surrenders his car keys to Raymond. Not thatRaymondis going soft. It's still, first, last, and foremost, funny. In the season-opener, \"The Invasion,\" Debra gleefully gives her mother-in-law a taste of her own meddlesome medicine, but her victories against the indomitable Marie are, as ever, short-lived. Yes, after three seasons,Raymondis still great. And it would continue to become even greater inseason 4.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000A7PKGW", "B004D2GMVM", "B000BNTM46", "B0001ZMWXW", "B006MFQ4DE", "B000T22PVG", "B000GRUMQY", "B000N8UXTW", "B00CJ7Y1CK", "B0009E27DA", "B00DVOA1AG", "B00070HK4C", "B0000CGNEC", "B000957O8C", "B0001BS3IY", "B000EYK4H6", "B000AJJNIQ", "B0007US79Y", "B000NA1W3Q", "B0001NBNJ8", "B000640WGM", "B005D0OHA6", "B000B8I9ZY", "B000B8384G", "B000FBH3WM", "B0058EE6OO", "B001JAHQP2", "B001P9N9B2", "B000FBH3WC", "B0001BS3IE", "B00AZR866I", "B000EBGFQI", "B002E58FT2", "B000GRU09S", "B000AJJNJK", "B000I2J6VE", "B000K4X5QM", "B000TGJ82G", "B00009Y3RW", "B008LCRABQ", "B0007KTBJO", "B000I2J6W8", "B0058J3S16", "B004B93RHY", "B000C1VBAA", "B00005JOHC", "B0007OCG74", "B004MWLXTY", "B0002W4SX6", "B0013D8M3U", "B00JDCP0QA", "B00GLT2SOA", "B002AMVEEM", "B005MQ58OU", "B00I099K4U", "B00005JLEX", "B0024F08TW", "B007C8RZJW", "B00HR2WIM2", "B000MX7V5W", "B000E6ESBW", "B00GOC75YW", "B005IA9JQ8", "B000HWZ4IE", "B000WMA72C", "B009LDD1X0", "B000BYRCF6", "B005DCJ0Q0", "B0007Y08P6", "B000ND91OA", "B002TQKL1Q", "B0058JEI06", "B0002UE1WQ", "B0002W4SWW", "B00005JM3A", "B002JVWQUU", "B00AXIGCWY", "B007PK8686", "B00B04NIOU", "B001VPJZ0E", "B000NJISJ8", "B001LRL4WY", "B0006ZM8M2", "B007C8RZYC", "B000W91RUG", "B001E6JC26", "B004WO9OMA", "B00650RX90", "B0002WZTLQ", "B0001907BW", "B0007PAM06", "B000YKYT1M", "B000CEXG00"], "bought_together": ["B000A7PKGW", "B004D2GMVM"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004D2GMVM", "B000A7PKGW", "B0001ZMWXW", "B000BNTM46"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 28498}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 15.97, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B0007R4SWC", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51KxyqtGg7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Everybody Loves Raymond: Season 3"}
{"description": "This is, by operatic standards of fidelity, a very faithful musical treatment of Edmond Rostand's classic drama about the swashbuckling poet and swordsman with the big nose. The music is competent but not spectacular; that quality is found in the libretto. The title role is expertly filled by Roberto Alagna, who not only has the best tenor voice in France but also turns out to be an accomplished actor in a demanding role. He is well-supported by a cast that clearly loves the story, its various characters and its often brilliant dialogue.Franco Alfano is best-known for his completion ofTurandotwhich was not quite finished at Puccini's death. Among his other work, he produced one operatic masterpiece of his own,Cyrano, which was long neglected but now has a fitting representation on home video. The opera also exists in an Italian translation, but Alfano originally used the superior French text by Henri Cain, which is used in this production.Nathalie Manfrino is charming as the beautiful but superficial Roxane, whom Cyrano loves hopelessly through his whole life without telling her, and Richard Troxell characterizes precisely the handsome but not particularly bright Christian, whom Cyrano assists in his wooing. The chorus, orchestra, sets, and costumes are all excellent, helping to make this a first-class production.--Joe McLellan", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 262223}, "categories": [["CDs & Vinyl", "Classical"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Opera & Classical Vocal"], ["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "title": "Alfano - Cyrano de Bergerac / Alagna, Manfrino, Rivenq, Ferrari, Troxell, Schaer, Barrard, Rittelmann, Habela, Guidarini, Montpellier Opera", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00HZ3L25M", "B000PC1N40", "B00IAV08DK", "B00I3LDEFQ", "B0012LH82Y", "B00008DDRK", "B007CYKHIW", "B00006674K", "B000O1715W", "B000UTOKJI", "B005USB1VY", "B0094AH3MU", "B0094AH3PC", "B0094AH348", "B001RPZDVS", "B008L1VZOU", "B006ZV6XL8", "B00CIWPJ0Y", "B008XNPNO4", "B0000AYL0J", "B003ZWTGKU", "B0002TTTK6", "B00D3O24NG", "B00068VQBI", "B0007ACVBE", "B000BP86UK", "B003UC49XO", "B000TMCG9C", "B00009PY2V", "B001U1L9NU", "B00I32AMPU", "B00007CVRJ", "B0000639FC", "B004JX8UB0", "B0009K1ZI2", "B0002K70C4", "B00005UW8C", "B00507ZQSO", "B0009DBXX6", "B00EWT17M0", "B00006L3WX", "B000OONQ1M", "B000L42J3Q", "B001DHE9K6", "B000E5KOK2", "B0007P0LN4", "B0000640T9", "B00006IUJ0", "B000A0XS18", "B000060P5O", "B007DCI0DM", "B000083C73", "B007AUKGXO", "B005IIA996", "B00007149G", "B00004UB8F", "B0094AH3RA", "B001RPZDW2", "B000FIMG7M", "B0094AH38Y", "B0094AH38E", "B008L1VZS6", "B0009I8PHS", "B0094AH3QQ", "B000A0XS0Y", "B0052GKCH8", "B0009YBYSE", "B0009W4LLS", "B0000028MH", "B0002HOD9A", "B000002RVI", "B000MGB0II", "B00925T9L0", "B00925T8YI", "B00005V15Q", "B000005E5L", "B0007ORDNQ"]}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41sini-FBgL._SY300_.jpg", "asin": "B0007RO4IA"}

{"description": "Driven by intelligent, constantly surprising and moving performances from the film's leads,Dear Frankiestars Emily Mortimer (Lovely and Amazing) as Lizzie, Scottish mother of Frankie (Jack McElhone), a deaf and highly intelligent 9-year-old. Constantly uprooting themselves and relocating from town to town, Lizzie and Frankie are on the run from the latter's abusive father, a fact unknown to the boy, who believes his dad is a busy seaman sending letters full of adventure and love. In fact, Lizzie is writing those missives, but she is faced with a challenge when Frankie discovers his father's ship will dock nearby. Lizzie hires a kind, handsome stranger (Gerard Butler) to play Frankie's dad, creating an odd situation in which ever-growing lies become a conduit for love, and Lizzie's repressed desires come to the fore with a man posing as her husband. The moral tangles are of interest in director Shona Auerbach's charmingly paced, quietly insightful drama-comedy, but so is the glorious feeling of watching these characters come fully alive.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00A2H9UG6", "B000GIXEIG", "B005FITIDC", "B00027NVXE", "B00007AJF4", "B000WP07F6", "B002ZG998G", "B002P413IC", "B000G8P1Y6", "B000YAA68C", "B000V8VNUM", "B00AEBB8QK", "B001M4YZ90", "B0059XTUR2", "B00AAQHP66", "B00003CXSD", "B001D7WF98", "B002XMGGK6", "B002SG7Z7A", "B004R6VHQY", "B004XYOQU4", "B001APZMJS", "B00009XN4C", "B00AEFYGBA", "B000FQISV2", "B00094AS9U", "B0007TKNII", "B0038N9X3Q", "B00BEIYHO2", "B00946G2YE", "B000OY9V8Y", "B00A2H9VBU", "B005FITIF0", "B003LL3FIY", "B000811672", "B00006JDVV", "B00008DDVT", "B005CFC0HE", "B00GSBMNOQ", "B000XS3WWW", "B004IY6A0S", "B00GPWEPZ8", "B00G15MDI0", "B00CBK6506", "B001APZMJ8", "B00006JU8B", "B000QXDED6", "B004SIP7PS", "B0000714BW", "B007A2O3FO", "B007K7IBTI", "B003HDYOTU", "B000GYI048", "B0000C2IR4", "B0009A1BW2", "B000A2W1X2", "B0015GDVTU", "B000NJWIPI", "0767020308", "B0009UZGIM", "B003SC9AVC", "B00EOHGQPI", "B00AQTY3XA", "B000654YWY", "B00AZMFO6I", "B000NVT0T8", "B002OVED88", "B0009G3BCY", "B00FZ4KR4U", "B0059XTUT0", "B0067EKY7M", "B00006ZXSO", "B0000UJLTG", "B0053Q9DHW", "B0002W18RU", "B00G7QPXAI", "B000HRMATU", "B00DL48BM6", "B00G6HO368", "B004SIP6BI", "B00BEIYGK2", "B000Z27HLS", "B002ZG988M", "B00104AYFQ", "B0040J1RZE", "B005S9EJ14", "B000P5FH26", "B000JLQQ7Q", "B00005JPSM", "B005PTMPYA", "B00GST8LMG", "B004KDYQXU", "B008N25XAE", "B000VKL6T8", "6305558205", "B0002V7S34", "B00008HC9B", "B000IJ7A24", "B00JAQJMJ0"], "bought_together": ["B00A2H9UG6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0007TKNII", "B00A2H9UG6", "B001APZMJS", "B000YAA68C"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 17921}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.14, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B00094AS9A", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51igVNYqynL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Dear Frankie"}
{"description": "Will Smith's easygoing charm makesHitchthe kind of pleasant, uplifting romantic comedy that you could recommend to almost anyone--especially if there's romance in the air. As suave Manhattan dating consultant Alex \"Hitch\" Hitchens, Smith plays up the smoother, sophisticated side of his established screen persona as he mentors a pudgy accountant (Kevin James) on the lessons of love. The joke, of course, is that Hitch's own love life is a mess, and as he coaches James toward romance with a rich, powerful, and seemingly inaccessible beauty named Allegra (Amber Valetta), he's trying too hard to impress a savvy gossip columnist (Eva Mendes) with whom he's fallen in love. Through mistaken identities and mismatched couples, director Andy Tennant brings the same light touch that made Drew Barrymore'sEver Afterso effortlessly engaging. As romantic comedies go,Hitchdoesn't offer any big surprises, but as a date movie it gets the job done with amiable ease and style.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0009RCPUW", "B001QERPAC", "B0013J55B6", "B000N6U0E2", "B0001Z3TXE", "B00005JN0T", "B0013FDM7E", "B00AEFY99O", "B003Y5H4ZW", "B000VXWX7E", "B002K0WBXW", "B000803BQC", "B000BKVQS4", "B000HT386M", "B003Y5H574", "0800141741", "6305428115", "B00007E2F5", "B00005JMW7", "B00AEBB9WI", "B00008G8M4", "B002VECM6S", "B000LC3ICE", "B000ELJAEM", "B00003CXSM", "B004EPZ0BG", "B00AEBB8NS", "076780421X", "B00164KYV4", "B00AEFY0F2", "B003Y5H524", "B000VG66XS", "B00008WJD6", "B00AEFXWXI", "B002ZG998G", "B002ZG989G", "B000YDBPAM", "B000CEV3KU", "B00005JPE3", "B000AP04FG", "B00005JLQN", "B001C5LLQ4", "B00003CXO1", "B002P413IC", "B0001AVZA8", "B0012KJ0DK", "B0015I2RT8", "B000E6EHE0", "B001NPD9RM", "B00008VFCA", "B00006ZXSL", "B000FGGWGK", "B000098XQ8", "B001OQCUZM", "B000MQC9H4", "B00005JN3W", "B00005IBN0", "B003BV8ICC", "B00006FMUW", "B001SN78JO", "B000RBA6C4", "B0009UZGIM", "B001GKJ2E8", "B00005JNTU", "B000ZBEOEC", "B00AEFY4CG", "B0000B1OFL", "B008RNYMG0", "B0038N9WKU", "B0021L8UYY", "B000683VI4", "6304765266", "B000TZJBPQ", "B00005JLSB", "B0007PLLBU", "B000059TG6", "B002ZG9968", "B003EYVXXC", "B0000897EG", "B00005JM4Q", "B004IK30MI", "B00081U7HC", "B002ZG97B0", "B000P0J0EW", "B00005O5CM", "B005F2JRUC", "B000ASDFGI", "B00005JKCH", "B0006GAI5U", "B0000AKCKI", "B001UV4XRY", "B00005JMQW", "B0010X5X4O", "B000M341QE", "B001AKTZW8", "B00024JC4E", "B00AEBB8R4", "B00005JKMQ", "B00CLSBNNM", "B005LAII2Q"], "bought_together": ["B000N6U0E2", "B001QERPAC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000N6U0E2", "B002ZG97TW", "B002VECM6S", "B000AP04FG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 105544}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.94, "brand": "SMITH,WILL", "asin": "B000957O7S", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41jGu0AHCAL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Hitch (Fullscreen Edition)"}

{"description": "Isao Takahata's outr&#xE9; ecological fablePom Pokowas the no. 1 domestic film in Japan in 1994, and the first animated feature to be submitted for the Oscar for Foreign Language Film. In 1967, the raccoons in the Tama Hills find their homes are threatened with destruction when developers turn the rural area into suburbs. Under the leadership of their tribal elders the animals fight back with every resource at their disposal. Raccoons are shape-shifters in Japanese folk tales, and the members of this tribe can transform into objects, other creatures and even humans.Unlike Takahata's deeply movingThe Grave of the Fireflies,Pom Poko(the sound made by thumping the tummy of a comfortably full raccoon) is a broad comedy. The raccoons' efforts to understand humans, their evocations of traditional ghost stories to frighten construction crews, and their internecine quarrels offers plenty of laughs. But the story rambles, and the characters lack the depth needed to sustain the audience's interest until the film's belated, downbeat conclusion. The extras include Takahata's storyboards, which are interesting, but lack the magic of Hayao Miyazaki's drawings on other Studio Ghibli discs.

{"description": "In the realm of revenge thrillers, you'd be hard pressed to find more ultra-violent vengeance and psycho thrills than in the creepy story ofOldboy. This Korean import made a pop splash at the Cannes Film Festival and during its limited theatrical run thanks to the imprimatur of Quentin Tarantino, who raved about it and its visionary director, Chan-wook Park, to anyone who would listen. It's easy to see why QT fell in love with the grindhouse attitude, fast-paced action, violent imagery, and icy-black humor, but it's a disservice to think ofOldboyas another Tarantino homage or knockoff. The darkly existential undercurrent in the themes thatOldboytraces over its life-long narrative arc is much more complex and deeply disturbing than anything of its kind. The movie's tagline is, \"15 years of imprisonment... 5 days of vengeance.\" The imprisonee is Oh Dae-Su, an ordinary Joe who is snatched off a Seoul street corner and locked away in a dank, windowless fleabag hotel room for the aforementioned 15 years. Just as abruptly he is released, and thus the five days begin. Why did this happen to Oh Dae-Su? Ah, but that would be telling, and in fact we don't know ourselves until the final wrenching scenes.Oldboybreaks into a classic three-act saga, the first of which details the hallucinatory period of imprisonment in which Oh Dae-Su wades from mild insanity to outright psychosis in the hands of unseen yet attentive captors. Act 2 is the revenge, when an entirely different tone takes over and Oh Dae-Su moves with single-minded purpose and clarity. It's this section that has gained the most notoriety, primarily for the claw-hammer dentistry scene, the one-man-army tracking shot, and the wriggling octopus that Oh Dae-Su consumes in a sushi bar (he's been dead so long he simply needs life back inside him in any way possible). In act 3, answers finally start to emerge and the sinister atmosphere grows even more profound--not without a healthy dose of extra bloodletting, of course.Oldboyis an undeniably poetic masterpiece of tension, fury, and dynamic craft. Ultimately, its epic cycle of tragedy is of the sort that mankind has been inflicting upon itself for all time. Some of the images may be gruesome, but all converge into a kind of beauty. It's in the telling of this lurid tale that these details become one and the memories of pain ultimately heal.--Ted Fry", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000BGH2A4", "B000GBEWNY", "B004P2VQZ2", "B00GMV8IVE", "B002P7UCJK", "B006L4MWVE", "B003Y7F1IW", "B004H2CXBQ", "B000GSYRY6", "B0000CABGW", "B0009WFEDC", "B003JDQJM8", "B003NLE5JA", "B000GSE6H4", "B0085A9J18", "B004XQO8MS", "B00C6WHPO4", "B000CRR3ME", "B00J5LXST0", "B0009XRZQK", "B0006VL1J2", "B00HOGBXS6", "B005X7HA6C", "B00CG0YLS4", "B001I82RVS", "B006C1S1DY", "B0013D8LBI", "B001MEJY8W", "B00IKM5OCO", "B0009NZ78I", "B00JJ3EHCG", "1593075685", "B000PKG8TW", "B005B0ZF3Q", "B0036BDQBU", "B001570H5K", "B0034G4P30", "B000I0RNWU", "B00HI9QGWC", "B008OTTVC2", "B00003CXZ4", "B000N6TX1I", "B00IA1VQBS", "B00IKM5MIA", "B00GMV8IGO", "B00005JN7C", "B006L4MWTQ", "B00J5LXTUI", "B00A3TFMDI", "B00003CXUM", "B005ZMBEXU", "B00HEPC0TS", "B00G3HCG9M", "B00005JNJR", "B00E1LNDDU", "B00005K9O8", "B0064NTZQ2", "B00GMV8M2Y", "B00DPUB56U", "B000MEYKCI", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B00AIBZMD6", "B00125WATQ", "B00009W0U4", "B00EI3XAZC", "B008JFUN50", "B004SIP6GI", "B000NA28GG", "B004P2VQXO", "B0000633R6", "B00JA3RVG4", "B00008975Z", "B00H9HZITU", "B000065V38", "B00DPUB5EW", "B008G1JIQC", "B0000CC885", "B004P2VQXE", "B003KGBISE", "B005Y1B3EW", "B00005RYKV", "B0048LPRCS", "B00JJ3EH6C", "B0000AVHAO", "B00HSJ2EMI", "B00JVQ7PWU", "B00GMV8HX8", "B0055T3RSS", "B00G4Q3KOC", "B00GMV8L1Q", "B0040QYRTA", "1593075707", "B00DSQTMRA", "B00H9KKGTO", "B008220DGE", "B001FOPOD8", "B00J11U54K", "B00GPPXNIK", "B00I45844W", "B00DCRE9LY"], "bought_together": ["B000BGH2A4", "B000GBEWNY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00GMV8IVE", "B004P2VQZ2", "B00J5LXST0", "B002P7UCJK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 17532}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 16.99, "brand": "", "asin": "B0009S2T0M", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5177K3F5Y0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Oldboy"}
{"description": "The Andy Griffith Showhit its stride during its third season (1962-63), admirably restored in this five-disc, 32-episode boxed set. Andy Griffith perfects his levelheaded Sheriff Andy Taylor; Don Knotts is unsurpassed as the comically neurotic Barney Fife; and Ron Howard continues his legendary run as earnest Opie. The season opens with the endearing episode \"Mr. McBeevee,\" Opie's friend in the trees who Andy believes to be a figment of his son's imagination. From there, every disc contains renowned classics, such as \"Floyd, the Gay Deceiver\" starring the dashing Howard McNear; \"Andy and Opie, Bachelors\" offering some of the season's greatest quips; and \"The Darlings Are Coming,\" that crazy clan of mountain musicians including the overtly flirtatious Charlene. The season is acclaimed for introducing several new, recurring characters into the cast including Gomer Pyle (Jim Nabors), \"Miss Peggy\" (Joanna Moore), and Helen Crump (Aneta Corsaut). Except for two episodes missing closing epilogue scenes (which Paramount discloses), the set contains 13 hours of full-length, uncut, black-and-white magic. Also included is the originally aired \"Fishin' Hole\"  theme music throughout the collection, as well as more than two dozen \"Sponsor Spots,\" vintage commercial advertisements featuring the show's cast. Don't miss the season highlight, \"Man In A Hurry,\" a touching story where Malcolm Tucker delivers the now-famous summation of Mayberry, \"Outrageous&#x85; a whole town is standing still because two old women's feet fall asleep,\" precisely the reason why this beloved sitcom remains a timeless treasure.

{"description": "The sum of its parts was definitely greater than the season whole asGilmore Girlskicked off its fourth year by separating its high-powered mother-daughter duo. After years of toil at snooty private school Chilton, Rory (Alexis Bledel) was finally off to the greener pastures of college as she began her first year at Yale. The not-so-long distance put a crimp in her relationship with her mother, Lorelai (Lauren Graham), as the two were forced to continue their chatty conversations via phone--not exactly the same as trading barbs face-to-face. While Rory adjusted to college life with cranky roommate Paris (Liza Weil) in tow, Lorelai found herself without a daughter, but gained a boyfriend in the form of Jason \"Digger\" Stiles (Chris Eigeman), a childhood friend and now her father's business partner. But the lure of Stars Hollow, the Gilmores' cherished country town, would prove too hard to resist, as Lorelai finally made plans to open her own inn, and the two ladies found themselves attracted to town residents--for Lorelai, an intensifying of her friendship with diner owner Luke (Scott Patterson), and for Rory, a return to old boyfriend Dean (Jared Padalecki), which put a decided tension into a show that sorely needed it. Nevermind that both men were married to other women!The first half of the fourth season definitely foundered, as the show's usually topnotch creative team struggled to find a way to keep the Gilmore chemistry afloat despite separating their main characters. There wasn't much drama to be found for Rory in starting college, and though it got off to a great start, Lorelai's relationship with Jason never fully gelled. However, once the show got its girls into the arms of their Stars Hollow men, it turned around almost immediately, surging towards a creative revival that put its ratings higher than they'd ever been before. Along the way to its surprising and complex season finale, there were great episodes to be had: \"Girls in Bikinis, Boys Doin' the Twist,\" which found Rory and Paris on spring break; \"The Reigning Lorelai,\" centering on an unexpected funeral; \"The Festival of Living Art,\" which had Stars Hollow resident re-creating classic works; and \"Luke Can See Her Face,\" which finally brought the Luke-Lorelai romance to the forefront. The season may have started out rough, but this fourth year ended with a bang, and the promise of more fireworks to come.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002BJGYTY", "B002BJGYV2", "B002BJGYU8", "B000G1R4SY", "B000N6TYLW", "B0001CCXZW", "B006WZIAHM", "B009MA9ZW8", "B00006JIBS", "B00G4SB5Z6", "B004STBF2G", "B0030Y12A0", "B000YAA2SQ", "B001FB4VZ8", "B00079FUI6", "B00B5AAW52", "B003QZSWRY", "B000R7HRRA", "B001ILFUAA", "1933771178", "B0006ZM8M2", "B0077PTWY6", "B0077PTWHI", "B0018CWEVW", "B001QUXNQG", "B000HT3PEM", "B00BGQ2NIO", "B00AEFYQE2", "B00BC0JH24", "B002BAW6I6", "B000NA1PUG", "B001FSKE84", "B00AOCZOLO", "B0001EQHXO", "B0012BS5XU", "B00G6HO368", "B005IA9JQ8", "B000Q6GUKW", "B0009K7QZ8", "0345532767", "B0040QTNSA", "B00005JO9J", "B00005JNOG", "B002BAW6HW", "B002W1HBK2", "B005IA9JRM", "B00871C09S", "B00003CXC3", "B001MVWRN4", "B002ZG988M", "B001DPHDBU", "B0006FFRBG", "B002ZG976U"], "bought_together": ["B002BJGYTY", "B002BJGYV2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002BJGYTY", "B0001CCXZW", "B002BJGYU8", "B002BJGYV2"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 37394}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 12.95, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B0009WFF6S", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51QBGyzDPsL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Gilmore Girls: Season 4 (Digipack)"}

{"description": "Movie studios, by and large, avoid controversial subjects like race the way you might avoid a hive of angry bees. So it's remarkable thatCrasheven got made; that it's a rich, intelligent, and moving exploration of the interlocking lives of a dozen Los Angeles residents--black, white, latino, Asian, and Persian--is downright amazing. A politically nervous district attorney (Brendan Fraser) and his high-strung wife (Sandra Bullock, biting into a welcome change of pace fromMiss Congeniality) get car-jacked by an oddly sociological pair of young black men (Larenz Tate and Chris \"Ludacris\" Bridges); a rich black T.V. director (Terrence Howard) and his wife (Thandie Newton) get pulled over by a white racist cop (Matt Dillon) and his reluctant partner (Ryan Phillipe); a detective (Don Cheadle) and his Latina partner and lover (Jennifer Esposito) investigate a white cop who shot a black cop--these are only three of the interlocking stories that reach up and down class lines. Writer/director Paul Haggis (who wrote the screenplay forMillion Dollar Baby) spins every character in unpredictable directions, refusing to let anyone sink into a stereotype. The cast--ranging from the famous names above to lesser-known but just as capable actors like Michael Pena (Buffalo Soldiers) and Loretta Devine (Woman Thou Art Loosed)--meets the strong script head-on, delivering galvanizing performances in short vignettes, brief glimpses that build with gut-wrenching force.

{"description": "When it premiered on CBS on October 2, 1955,Alfred Hitchcock Presentswas an instant hit destined for long-term popularity. The series' original half-hour anthology format provided a perfect showcase for stories of mystery, suspense, and the macabre that reflected Hitchcock's established persona. Every Sunday at 9:30 p.m., the series began with the familiar theme of Gounod's \"Funeral March of a Marionette\" (which would thereafter be inextricably linked with Hitchcock), and as Hitchcock's trademark profile sketch was overshadowed by the familiar silhouette of Hitchcock himself, the weekly \"play\" opened and closed with the series' most popular feature: As a good-natured host whose inimitable presence made him a global celebrity, Hitchcock delivered droll, dryly sardonic introductions and epilogues to each week's episode, flawlessly written by James Allardyce and frequently taking polite pot-shots at CBS sponsors, or skirting around broadcast standards (which demanded that no crime could go unpunished) by humorously explaining how the show's killers and criminals were always brought to justice... though always with a nod and a wink to the viewer.This knowing complicity was Hitchcock's pact with his audience, and the secret to his (and the series') long-term success. It's also what attracted a stable of talented writers whose teleplays, both original and adapted, maintained a high standard of excellence. Hitchcock directed four of the first season's 39 episodes, including the premiere episode \"Revenge\" (a fan favorite, with futurePsychocostar Vera Miles) and the season highlight \"Breakdown,\" with Joseph Cotten as a car-accident victim, paralyzed and motionless, who's nearly left for dead; it's a perfect example of visual and narrative economy, executed with a master's touch. (The fourth episode, \"Don't Come Back Alive,\" is also a popular favorite, with the kind of sinister twist that became a series trademark.) Robert Stevenson directed the majority of the remaining episodes with similar skill, serving tightly plotted tales (selected by associate producers Joan Harrison and Norman Lloyd) by such literary greats as Ray Bradbury, Robert Bloch, Cornell Woolrich, Dorothy L. Sayers, and John Collier. Adding to the series' prestige was a weekly roster of new and seasoned stars, with first-season appearances by Cloris Leachman, Darren McGavin, Everett Sloane, Peter Lawford, Charles Bronson, Barry Fitzgerald, John Cassavetes, Joanne Woodward, Thelma Ritter, and a host of Hollywood's best-known character players. With such stellar talent on weekly display,Alfred Hitchcock Presentspaved the way forThriller,The Twilight Zone, and other series that maximized the anthology format's storytelling potential.Packed onto three double-sided DVDs, these 39 episodes hold up remarkably well, and while some prints show the wear and tear of syndication, they look and sound surprisingly good (although audio compression will cause many viewers to turn up the volume). The 15-minute bonus featurette, \"Alfred Hitchcock Presents: A Look Back\" is perfunctory at best, but it's nice to see new anecdotal interviews with Norman Lloyd, assistant director Hilton Green, and Hitchcock's daughter Pat (a frequent performer on these episodes), who survived to see their popular series benefit from the archival convenience of DVD.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000HDR814", "B000TXPXD2", "B002NPY7GS", "B005UL4NF2", "B00FEOYY8G", "B003NOGNQU", "B0002CX1M0", "B00BI3XZA0", "B0007CEXUY", "B001DXS4DI", "B002GSXKQA", "B000UVV25Q", "B000H5U5EE", "B006TBYC76", "B00KTZALDC", "B000A9QK7I", "B001HNDR4A", "B003VJTGNE", "B00BQK4YDC", "B005EVY8MQ", "B0002HOEPS", "B000A1INJE", "B0002NRRRE", "B00C6F61S2", "B000TJBNF8", "B00EEEHLKU", "B00JKTFQJM", "B000BC8T1E", "B001D8W7F4", "B00009VRF0", "B00IU6HQ4O", "B000MGBSDK", "B00CPTUN8S", "B00KBES386", "B007I8KXQ8", "B004CQZFL2", "B00JEZWRE4", "B0002J4ZX2", "B002DMJM7K", "B00016XN48", "B00068NVLQ", "B008OIQYXM", "B009OE2O0C", "B000F48D0U", "B00KE3B9US", "B00005JO3P", "B005D7E7Y0", "B00308B170", "B0030BS1E8", "B004IB04S0", "B00HQLZCIQ", "B0016MOWNM", "B00F6D62O4", "B009OE2NZI", "B00005JN8Q", "B000BQ5IXW", "B0008ENID4", "B001D8W7EK", "B00DZP1C18", "B0012KSUUO", "B00AQMGQVY", "B009OE2ODY", "B00BDZV4OW", "B00005JLIC", "B00E5G03I4", "B000QTCY7M", "B0044A5BPQ", "B005NHZAXM", "B008I34Y3K", "B001992NXI", "B001CQONOA", "B000IHYXJO", "B0002COTDA", "B00096S480", "B002ACKBU0", "B000LE16VC", "B005BUA1F8", "B000BF0C7A", "B009OE2NS0", "B008DCAG9M", "B005LVIP1E", "B001BN4WHW", "B000BGR1B4", "B009GGWW3W", "B00ARA4SLU", "B00BAXTYI0", "B000PHX5KU", "B001SLNPSO", "B001JAHPMG", "B000OPOAKW", "B00000JNUZ", "B001E6HUWK", "B00G5N6C8U", "B00000C0QO", "B00009Y3RE", "B000LXGXY8", "B008MIYKS0", "B000MGBSQM", "B000ECX0O2", "B00GSMZ3I8"], "bought_together": ["B000HDR814", "B000TXPXD2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005UL4NF2", "B000TXPXD2", "B002NPY7GS", "B00FEOYY8G"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 30917}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 21.25, "brand": "HITCHCOCK,ALFRED", "asin": "B000AL733G", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41nEauPqQpL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Alfred Hitchcock Presents - Season One"}

{"description": "Oh boy. Here we go again! Just another exciting day in the life of24super-agent Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland). The season kicks off with a deadly terrorist strike resulting in the kidnapping of his new boss, the U.S. Secretary of Defense James Heller (William Devane). Although a fired, ex-employee of the Counter Terrorist Unit (CTU), it is no surprise who is going to shift into full gear to bring the terrorists to justice. However, it doesn't take the super-agent long to discover the kidnapping of his boss is part of a much larger plan, master-minded by Habib Marvan (Arnold Vosloh) the middle eastern terrorist cell leader the US government has been trying to track down for years. Considered by many to be the best season of the first four,24 - Season 4is a definite departure from the first three seasons. First, the cast is almost entirely new. Second, the pacing of each episode does not seem as frantic. There appears to be a shift from the reliance on plot-shifting cliff hangers (which in some ways dragged down the quality of Season 3), to a focus on complex, over-arcing, multiple storylines, albeit very violent. What may be missing in superficial action clich&#xE9;s is definitely compensated for in a richer plot. That's not to say the show has slowed down; it's still amped up beyond anything else on TV, but compared to the previous seasons,24has gotten a lot smarter, and in turn, better.--Rob Bracco", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0002XVQSU", "B000ICLRKC", "B000MR8W92", "B00008YGRU", "B001L5SRJE", "B000NDEXK2", "B002ZCY7SW", "B001DMVZOE", "B002ZCY7TG", "B0015QWZ8S", "B00G4RCXPI", "B000KQF6ZI", "B0000DIJNU", "B000FKO3GW", "B00KPP6R9S", "0756632277", "B000RO6JY0", "B000JBXHZK", "B000F8DV1M", "B00KPP6ZLS", "B000G5SILC", "B00129W6LE", "B0015RRNMA", "B001HUWQEA", "1845764633", "B000NDEXKW", "B001JNNDJM", "B0018CWEYY", "B005TZFZ5Q", "B001934SNM", "B00E8OMZGG", "B000BNI90Y", "B001993YD6", "B002HRF68A", "B0060MYLCU", "B005FOH19Y", "B00BC5I6Q2", "0060842245", "B00EIXWMII", "B004ZBFRG2", "B00915G6NK", "B00HLTD3ZW", "B009LDD1H6", "B00AIBZMD6", "B00IXPQU8U", "B00HT850YW", "B0024F08RO", "B0015TX2LO", "B000AJJNFE", "B0027VST2Q", "B004YM6IZ6", "B0053O8AKU", "B001RTSPVY", "B0044E9JU0", "B000W91RUG", "B002N5N5NE", "B000FIMG68", "B008K1PWMW", "B000P6YNSE", "B000GB75CO", "B0020TS5EM", "B000RO6JZ4", "B0019LY5IM", "B00HEPE6MM", "B000R9YLKY", "B00KS9V6EC", "B00J5LXT44", "B001A4VH2U", "B000HT3P60", "B000FVQLIO", "B00005JNOG", "B001DJLCRC", "B0036EH3XE", "B0032UYFA6", "B005QET8FS", "B000V86OKG", "B003R0MEZ4", "B00EEDNR9A", "B0058YPG1G", "B00BD6KXKW", "B0015ABRE2", "B00158K0R4", "B005FISBTO", "B0027CSMY0", "B007A2Z3Y4", "B00B5J6A7W", "B00EIXWW2O", "B00AIBZMM2", "B00J49R0ZQ", "B009MF5BXK", "B00HOGBXS6", "B00JA3RVG4", "B00HEPC0TS", "B001AI776G", "B0058YPILY", "B00FEVZH8K", "B00HUCF420", "B003L77G1K", "B009DS6YGO"], "bought_together": ["B0002XVQSU", "B000ICLRKC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000NDEXKW", "B0002XVQSU", "B000ICLRKC", "B000MR8W92"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 7242}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 22.89, "brand": "20th Century Fox", "asin": "B000B837XI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51JD8J6VK0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "24: Season 4"}

{"description": "One of the year's most highly praised pictures, Jia Zhangke's ravishing epic opens in a rush of color and sound. Here's young China in action, optimistic and bursting with life. First there's yelling (for a badly-needed Band-Aid), then music--gurgling synths atop a pan-ethnic beat--as the sequin and feather-bedecked performers of the \"Five Continents\" company take the stage of the real-life World Park. As the ads say, \"See the world without ever leaving Beijing,\" and 106 of the globe&#x92;s major sites are recreated in miniature, like a third-scale Eiffel Tower and mini-Lower Manhattan--complete with Twin Towers. Doll-faced Tao (Tao Zhao), ever-present cell phone in hand, is at the center of the maelstrom. Her boyfriend, Taisheng (Taisheng Chen), is a security guard with a sideline in fake IDs (and infidelity). When some Russian guest workers join the troupe, Tao's increasingly insular world briefly expands. She and Anna (Alla Shcherbakova) don't speak the same language, but do what they can to communicate. Tao envies her new friend&#x92;s \"freedom\"--she's never been beyond China's borders--unaware that Anna's nomadic existence is by necessity rather than choice. When she finds that Anna has become an escort, Tao's world snaps back to its previous dimensions, ultimately shrinking down to nothing.The Worldis unambiguously ambitious, with elaborate dance sequences, animated text messages, and tragic subplots.

{"description": "Like a dream,Howl's Moving Castlecarries audiences to vistas beyond their imaginations where they experience excitement, adventure, terror, humor, and romance. With domestic box office receipts of over $210 million,Howlpassed Miyazaki'sPrincess Mononoketo become the #3 film in Japanese history, behind hisSpirited Awayand James Cameron'sTitanic. Based on a juvenile novel by Diana Wynne Jones,Howl's Moving Castlemarks the first time Miyazaki has adapted another writer's work sinceKiki's Delivery Service(1989). Sophie, a 19-year-old girl who believes she is plain, has resigned herself to a drab life in her family's hat shop--until the Witch of the Waste transforms her into a 90-year-old woman. In her aged guise, Sophie searches for a way to break the Witch's spell and finds unexpected adventures. Like Chihiro, the heroine ofSpirited Away, Sophie discovers her hidden potential in a magical environment--the castle of the title. Using CG, Miyazaki creates a ramshackle structure that looks like it might disintegrate at any moment. Sophie's honesty and determination win her some valuable new friends: Markl, Howl's young apprentice; a jaunty scarecrow; Calcifer, a temperamental fire demon; and Heen, a hilarious, wheezing dog. She wins the heart of the dashing, irresponsible wizard Howl, and brings an end an unnecessary and destructive war. The film overflows with eclipsing visuals that range from frightening aerial battles to serene landscapes, and few recent features--animated or live action--offer as much magic asHowl's Moving Castle.--Charles SolomonThe Many Worlds of Hayao MiyazakiThe works of MiyazakiThe BookThe Art of Howls' Moving Castle(book)Stills fromHowl's Moving Castle(click for larger image)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JLEU", "B00003CXBK", "B002ZTQV8Y", "B002ZTQVHK", "B002ZTQVLG", "B0001XAPZ6", "B002ZTQVGQ", "B005LAIGX2", "B0006J28BO", "B00CSYR432", "B006LLY8LY", "B000CDGVOO", "B0001XAPY2", "0061478784", "B004CRR9EW", "B00ENNO1E6", "B004CRR9G0", "B0009MAO3W", "B00CSYRHG6", "B00B1RB942", "B002ZTQVBQ", "B005LAIGXM", "B00ENNUC9Y", "B00CJ7Y0US", "B007JNTPSO", "B001XUTVLK", "0061477974", "B0009P42S2", "B0023S49YU", "B008XEZXYI", "B008XEZXRA", "6304493681", "B004KL0OW4", "B004916TPG", "B002APNJC4", "B00BEYYEJ4", "B007D5R4GI", "B001QU9RSY", "B007JNTOBC", "B001VBM0Z0", "1421541181", "B002PTBSE6", "B001AXU1DC", "B0054JELWU", "1421566028", "B007V973TO", "B0001IN0MQ", "0316369020", "1569317771", "B00F8PTBLQ", "B009LDCUP0", "B000UPMZ1C", "B000M2E33G", "B00GSPKRN6", "B00005NB94", "1421500493", "B008YRL7JE", "B000FZETRU", "0061478776", "B00CEJIT0S", "B007BMIFL6", "B005NQ5LLY", "B00005RDSQ", "B005W2BWQW", "B0034G4OZE", "B003VQO4W0", "B003SPDSA8", "B0036TGSW6", "B004EC5IUW", "B004EC5IV6", "B0030ZOYHC", "B00576U9EO", "B0055HK792", "B00BQ1DDUG", "B00CU6WC94", "B002ZG97YM", "B007BMIGQ0", "B00CU6WBOU", "B000AAF1U4", "B00005JLR2", "B00JYKNVBW", "B000CEXFZG", "B0018RKEGY", "B001AI7766", "B000OLGCFW", "B001C4ZQEI", "B000LSAIZ8", "B005NQ5LOQ", "B00005JKZV", "B005HVWW6C", "B000FZETI4", "B0049TC8C6", "B008YRL7JO", "B004W75BQU", "B00005JN4W", "B00GWWADDY"], "bought_together": ["B00005JLEU", "B00003CXBK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00003CXBK", "B002ZTQV8Y", "B00005JLEU", "B002ZTQVHK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 1870}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 22.99, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B000CDGVOE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ROjdVz1uL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Howl's Moving Castle"}

Charlize Theron (Monster) plays Josey Aimes, who goes to work at a Minnesota steel mine after splitting with her violent husband.Frances McDormand and CharlizeTheron inNorth Country.But the job proves to be almost as harrowing as her marriage; the male miners, resentful of women taking jobs, verbally abuse and play humiliating pranks on the female miners. After being physically assaulted by a coworker, Josey tries to fight against the harassment, but none of the other women will join her case for fear that things will only get worse.North Country, directed by Niki Caro (Whale Rider), makes the women's experience palpable for the audience without overdoing it. But the lawsuit is only part of the movie; the gut impact ofNorth Countrycomes from the devastating effect the lawsuit has on Josey's family, friends, and coworkers--thanks to an incredible ensemble cast that includes Sissy Spacek (In the Bedroom), Sean Bean (Lord of the Rings), Richard Jenkins (Six Feet Under), Woody Harrelson (The People vs. Larry Flynt), and the always powerful Frances McDormand (Fargo,Mississippi Burning). The courtroom histrionics don't always ring true, but the family conflict is riveting and deeply moving.

{"description": "Any fan of Steve Martin's2000 novellawill enjoy this pitch-perfect adaptation, which glowingly captures the bittersweet tones of a May-December romance. Martin wrote the screenplay and stars as Ray Porter, a button-down 50-something executive who reaches out to a much younger woman as a Los Angeles playmate. The book and movie, though, are both primarily about Mirabelle (Claire Danes), a 20-something with a pile of promises, debt, and depression, as she fades away into a slow corner of Saks selling unneeded formal gloves. She's a wisp of a person, with a cat who doesn&#x92;t love her, and when she finds a suitor, it's Jeremy (Jason Schwartzman), a scruffy artist who babbles on about speakers. When the gentlemanly Porter calls, his appearance in her life begins to make her whole. It also immediately sets her up for sadness--Ray thinks of Mirabella as a precious outlet for sex, while Mirabelle, very mistakenly, sees Ray as a potential lifelong mate. Martin deftly turns the novella's prose into dialogue, allowing the movie to feel full-bodied, and the film also works as a comedy, as we witness Jeremy's growth on the road with a rock band. Schwartzman would walk away with film if not for the perfectly cast leads: Martin does another smart turn away from his wild-and-crazy moniker, Danes has never been better in an Oscar-worthy performance, and Bridgette Wilson-Sampras aces her role as a hot-to-trot co-worker of Mirabelle's. Whoever's decision to have Martin be the omnipresent narrator, though, should be penalized, as it&#x92;s confusing to have him in two roles, and the information is pretty useless, even robbing the film of a final grace note.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000F5FNPC", "B000F6IODE", "B000BYY11Y", "B00079HZUM", "B00008979G", "B000V6LSOA", "B003BZ58RQ", "B005Z9MH7U", "B0012BR8DI", "B0000797IO", "B000VY1EYG", "0786891076", "B000062WWZ", "B00081U7HC", "B00005JMJ4", "B004499LX0", "B00B9ZD73M", "B0016MJ6HY", "B0064MT1FI", "B000EQHXNW", "0767818105", "B00005JMWP", "B000BX8R10", "B0038N9WKU", "B000056BSJ", "1419897543", "B00ADRYCWC", "B004L3AR0K", "B002ONC9NC", "0783227353", "B000NIVJFY", "B00IKM5OCO", "B005Z9MGRG", "6305428239", "B0002KPIQY", "B000CNESJO", "B000035Z3C", "B000EDWKXI", "B0010X8NF0", "078322740X", "B000053VB5", "B00AEFY8MM", "B00007JXWX", "B00FZ4KR4U", "B000BBOUUE", "B001UV4XGU", "0786866586", "B000IU37SO", "0783229402", "B0071HPP3M", "B00IXD2LJY", "B000ADWDFC", "B000GFRI54", "B0000640VJ", "6305308802", "B000067J1O", "B004XVMCKS", "B002T51X4Q", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B0001Z4P2I", "B004XVMCK8", "B000B8QG22", "B003Z8ZC2A", "B001KP2J2G", "B004D45NYC", "B00005JMBQ", "B00AEBB8P6", "B00005JL7Q", "B00007AJE1", "B00BMKGZVA", "B00BEIYGK2", "B000CS45TW", "B00005JMJD", "B00005KHJJ", "B00319ECBK", "B0068MNO2U", "B004LWZWBU", "B0013D8LCC", "B004GJYRA0", "B000LXHK2C", "B002O3Z4ZW", "B001P3SA8K", "B003Y5H574", "B000T988I8", "B002ZFEQ76", "B001URA5Y8", "B002ZG99UE", "B00G3DA5XA", "0767815122", "B001UV4XUG", "B00AEBB9G4", "B00FWSWIUU", "B0001O3YV2", "B00AADAEBW", "B00008972P", "B001MM3AZM", "B00AEFXJ86", "B00A18CG76", "B004H83IG4", "B00803PFWM"], "bought_together": ["B000F6IODE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0786866586", "B00079HZUM", "B007HW18CS", "B002WY65VA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 30533}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.45, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B000EDWKX8", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51vVNaGhmPL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Shopgirl"}

Pulsing with tension, Match Point rides the dangerous line between ambition and obsession to an ending as surprising as it is chilling.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000IU37SO", "B001DJ7PR8", "B003UESJCY", "B0013D8LC2", "B000AM6P2U", "B00005AUJK", "B00005JMON", "B000062XE6", "B005MYEQ4U", "B00A1O0G3G", "B002LMV7RA", "B000RIWAVC", "B005TTEFZ8", "0767819764", "6305291470", "B00008L3SA", "B00AEFYVUQ", "B001KEHAEE", "B00008978N", "B00005O06J", "6305327068", "B00004STRD", "6305428085", "B00005JL81", "B002ZG97O2", "0792846109", "0792846087", "B004U7MR4G", "B00005UW73", "B001539HQY", "6304907729", "076782153X", "B00000JGOI", "B00C7T0EPS", "B00003CY6A", "B00G7QPXUI", "B00005O06L", "B00080ZHD2", "B00005AUJI", "B00133KFGW", "B00013D580", "B00005O06N", "B001G9F9IW", "B005M2AKJW", "B00020X88E", "B0006A9FIM", "B00003CXGS", "B000GIXLXE", "0780622243", "B000FO0AD8", "B000K2UVZM", "B00005O06M", "B000F3UAFC", "B00005AUJH", "B00BTYXNPK", "B00005O06I", "B0064NTZKI", "0792846125", "B000255LIY", "B00005O06K", "B0007VZ9D0", "0792846117", "B00020VZTS", "B00005AUJM", "B00A1O0G5E", "B006FSRSTC", "B000VKL6T8", "B00GTZWVXE", "B000KWZ7JC", "B00005JMJ4", "B0007Q6VY6", "B0001US61O", "B00E1HIXEI", "B002VECLVO", "B004499LX0", "B00FRILRW0", "B007NYZA0Q", "B0006FO8E8", "B000N3SU92", "B0016Q2D66", "B00005AUJE", "B007ZIUP14", "B00AEFYCW8", "B0041KKYEM", "B00003CXZ4", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B001CC7PLM", "B002Q3MZXE", "B00K0MM4AM", "B004QI14KW", "B001CIOCJ4", "B00GPPXNIK", "B009UTX4M8", "B0017APPSE", "B001PPLJIQ", "B00GMV8M2Y", "B00G7QPYX4", "B00BSN0VZW", "B00384TDZ8", "B00005AUJO"], "bought_together": ["B001DJ7PR8", "B000IU37SO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005MYEQ4U", "B001DJ7PR8", "B0006A9FIM", "B00JJ3EHCG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 8735}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.52, "brand": "Dreamworks Skg", "asin": "B000EQHXNW", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4102J5QS38L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Match Point"}
{"description": "The Time Tunnelrivaled Mr. Peabody for improbable history, and in the series' final 15 episodes, scientists Tony Newman (James Darrin) and Doug Phillips' (Robert Colbert) time travels take an increasingly fantastic turn, as witness their close encounters with aliens in \"Visitors from Beyond the Stars,\" \"The Kidnappers,\" \"Raiders from Outer Space,\" and the final episode, \"Town of Terror\" (listen in these episodes for the music that shamelessly steals from Bernard Herrmann's score forThe Day the Earth Stood Still). Things even take a supernatural turn in \"The Ghost of Nero.\" Tony and Doug's excellent adventures include meetings with such personages as Rudyard Kipling (\"Night of the Long Knives\"), \"Billy the Kid,\" and, incredibly, Machiavelli, who has been transported to Gettysburg during the Civil War (\"The Death Merchant\"). They also meet up with such mythical characters as Robin Hood (\"The Revenge of Robin Hood\") and \"Merlin the Magician.\"  One of the series' more provocative episodes is \"The Walls of Jericho,\" in which Tony and Doug join forces with Joshua. Observing from Project Tic-Toc's underground facility, Dr. Ann MacGregor (Lee Meriwether) expresses skepticism over the biblical story. \"I'm a scientist,\" she states. \"I don't permit myself to believe in miracles.\" Other memorable episodes include \"Kill Two by Two,\" set on a Pacific Island during 1945 where Tony and Doug meet a disgraced Japanese soldier, and the episode featuring Robert Duvall as a saboteur who leads Tony and Doug on a \"Chase Through Time.\"Among this series' enduring charms are the obvious use of footage from theatrical films to clumsily boost production values, as well as some of the more juvenile dialogue. When they learn of one alien plot to attack earth, our heroes proclaim, \"We can't let them do it.\" Time ran out on theTunnelafter only one season. Its cancellation left Tony and Doug to seemingly forever tumble \"along the infinite corridors of time\" en route to some \"new fantastic adventure.\" Thanks to DVD, we can join them time after time.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000BOH8Z0", "B001HUHBBS", "B000BZISS0", "B000GUJZ0U", "B000FFJ87Q", "B000K7VHYG", "B001MT7ZJC", "B000TLTCTK", "B0044XV7AQ", "B0006UEVTA", "B0014BQR3I", "B0002IQKAY", "B00096S47G", "B0002XVQNK", "B001HUHBB8", "B0000DC3VM", "B000P5FH2Q", "B00144P9RA", "B001CQONOA", "B0012Z36EO", "B00E5G03I4", "B006TBYC76", "B00KTZALDC", "B001DXS4DI", "B00BUDDMGU", "B000PFUAN2", "B0002CX1M0", "B000ATQYWY", "B00005JM5Z", "B00G5N6C8U", "B0007CEXUY", "B00IF0KAYS", "B00D9EJFZA", "B008LC8RQ8", "B001PR2186", "B001B0H7DG", "B00JK47BHM", "B00GX7D5G0", "B00105307O", "B0000AZKJ8", "B000LE16Y4", "B002VA5A02", "B00EEEHL9G", "B000V3JGIS", "B00KYCA4QY", "B005DKS1Z8", "B000ERVJKO", "B00E96AY20", "B008HSK3PE", "B00IYJFB2G", "B00CPR3RB0", "B000HEWEJ4", "B000N6UF10", "B001DZOCZU", "B00DXLO0D6", "B0009JE6G6", "B000UX6TKC", "B0050MB5AC", "B00JEZWRE4", "B004PQM81E", "B002L9N4E2", "B00HMOWA0A", "B003J216K4", "B000HWZ4HU", "B007ZR9H64", "B0016MOWNM", "B000KLQUT4", "B0012Z36FI", "B00IXPWGIS", "B001BN4WI6", "B000O78KY2", "B000RZIGTA", "B00CPTUMY8", "B00IO998U2", "B000O78KWE", "B00E9ZAU02", "B001DHXT6G", "B009OE2ODY", "B00I208ZHA", "B000LV6W00", "B000CSTKGA", "B0018BDDH2", "B000HWZ4GQ", "B00079HZS4", "B000UX6TJI", "B005DGKBDC", "B0045HCJSA", "B0062KMDWU", "B001E0O8DA", "B005JJCMNU", "B000HWZ4E8", "B000NOIX66", "B00769U98Q", "B001B23ED6", "B00C10EG7A", "B0002NY81C", "B0012EBV88", "B0002J4ZX2", "B000W4KT9G", "B00B00HUC0"], "bought_together": ["B000BOH8Z0", "B001HUHBBS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000BOH8Z0", "B001CQONOA", "B001HUHBBS", "B000LE16Y4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 26154}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 20.5, "brand": "20TH Century Fox", "asin": "B000EXDS2A", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DK3BG3GZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Time Tunnel - Volume Two"}

{"description": "A movie that exudes affection and goodwill,The World's Fastest Indianis an unabashed mash note to a lovely character from New Zealand's recent past. Burt Munro, played by Anthony Hopkins, is a cantankerous Kiwi with an obsession:  he's been tinkering with his 1920s-era Indian brand motorcycle for years, pushing it to ever-faster speeds. It's the 1960s, and Burt has the utterly mad idea of taking the bike to the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah, site of world records for speed racing. The movie takes a while to get to the journey--and then the journey takes a while--but the genial atmosphere prevails. (People of a certain age, for whom the word \"Bonneville\" evokes pleasant associations with hotrods and world-speed records, will not be disappointed in the film's location shooting, or its sense of awe.) Hopkins is not quite on-the-money casting for the jovial, happy-go-lucky Munro, and his accent wavers, but he nails the emotional scenes and the fascination with speed. Smaller bits are well-filled by Diane Ladd and Christopher Lawford (son of Peter), who looks uncannily of the era. New Zealand director Roger Donaldson doesn't take any chances here, but the story clearly means something to him, and that sense of commitment carries the film through its sleepier moments.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B007SUW27E", "B0000YTP02", "B00004Y62V", "B00000JXVK", "B009R68HIA", "B000S88JT8", "B000022TSY", "B00GHYIQ18", "B0039UU3KA", "B007XF0X52", "B001CDFY50", "B000C3L2PC", "B000QFCD7W", "B0006HBZXS", "B0006FYOTC", "B004GSVX9O", "B001LM64S8", "B00005ONLF", "B0009XT8C4", "B00407PNY2", "B00BEIYP1W", "B00E3ZDTWO", "B0000542CH", "B0001GOH6Q", "B007TBJUVI", "B00I3HFB7E", "B0024FAG6M", "6305989435", "B00000IQW5", "B000OHZJIM", "B000CNFC76", "B001VC99HQ", "B000YAF4MA", "B0001NBLX6", "B00I3HFAIE", "B0003JAO5Y", "B0008ENHUI", "B0002HRKVS", "B000085EFG", "B001KXZGO6", "B00066FBQG", "B00AEFXN9G", "B00AEFY7NM", "B003VRJ89S", "B00002SSKG", "B000LPS34E", "B004SIP7ZS", "B003ASLJO0", "B005LAIGRS", "B003UESJME", "B005CMSDLE", "B008JFURII", "B00GNZLWD0", "B002VWNIBI", "B00D3LA5WG", "B004GJYRI2", "B00AEFYVMO", "B0009NSCS0", "B00AEBBA36", "B0042JIL2E", "B004QBWU02", "B00003CXMY", "B00AZNEW5G", "B00C6QYMJG", "B00AHTYI5M", "6305213283", "B00936A0RU", "B0000B1OFL", "B005EVY8MQ", "6305133468", "B002NZK5UK", "B00AEBB9F0", "B00HZMZ218", "B000A7DVR2", "B00AEFY4IA", "B002M2Z3BA", "B002AS464Q", "B00AG4714S", "B00AEBB932", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B00006ADD5", "B00006FDCT", "B000MQC9H4", "B00AEBB86A", "B00AKGG6S4", "B000096IAC", "B00IF0KAYS", "B00005JMCN", "B00DDT0JB0", "B000P0J0EW", "B0018PH3L0", "B00AEBB8YW", "B004DK5CW4", "630560097X", "B00005LOL0", "B00E8G5HZ0", "B003L20IG0", "B000G6BLWE", "B000AP04L0"], "bought_together": ["B0000YTP02"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0000YTP02", "B00004Y62V"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 5731}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.2, "brand": "MAGNOLIA HOME ENTERTAINMENT", "asin": "B000F8DBDK", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51QVB6EB2PL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The World's Fastest Indian"}

{"description": "The bonds of true friendship and love are powerful enough to persist through even the most extreme circumstances, but can even the strongest bond endure when a young man and a young woman are split apart by the spirits?  Since being turned into a bear as punishment for his insensitivity inBrother Bear, Kenai has managed to find true happiness and a compelling sense of purpose in his new relationship with his adopted brother Koda.  But when Kenai's old friend Nita prepares for her wedding day with another man, the spirits send a sign indicating that a strong connection still exists between Kenai and Nita.  The tribe Shaman suggests that the two join forces in a ritual to sever the bond between them and Nita, newly endowed with the ability to communicate with animals, seeks out Kenai in the woods.  Even as the two friends resolutely journey to break the connection between them, the inescapable bond between them strengthens and threatens to disrupt not only Nita's upcoming marriage, but the special relationship between Kenai and Koda.  In the end, destiny may require that each of the three choose between his or her happiness and the happiness of the other two.  Like its predecessorBrother Bear,Brother Bear 2features lush animation; a nice blend of action, suspense, and comedy; and a powerful message.

{"description": "Over-the-top yet well-written,Nip/Tuckwas one of the most intriguing shows on television&#x85; until season three, when it took everything--everything--way too far. What once used to be a show about self-worth and society's perception of beauty as portrayed by plastic-surgery patients has become about the abject humiliation of women and rampant storylines. It alienated many fans, who found its love of excess ludicrous and at times, unforgivable. Maybe it was the storyline about Matt (John Hensley), who discovers the love of his life was actually a transsexual, shaves his head and starts dating a white supremacist (American Dreams'Brittany Snow). Or the disturbing new plastic-surgery cases (obese woman physically stuck to her couch, a 17-year-old petrified fetus). Or even the new surgeon Quentin Costa (Bruno Campos) who sleeps with male patients, romances Julia (Joely Richardson) and turns out to have a little \"physical quirk\" of his own? But the knife that truly stabbed the show's pace into the ground was the ongoing mystery of the Carver, a rapist/killer in a creepy porcelain mask who disfigures victims. Just when the show starts to jell, another character with their mouth cutBlack Dahlia-style turns up and throws the show back into a whodunnit, and not even a well-crafted one at that: By the time they reveal the killer's identity, you just don't care anymore.Someone also made a mess of the characters, or at least turned them all manic-depressive; the moral flip-flopping between Sean (Dylan Walsh) and Christian (Julian McMahon) is inexplicable at best. One goes wild, the other grows a conscience--and then they switch sides. One is on the brink of divorce, the other gets engaged--and another switch. It's headache-inducing how each of the main characters become nonsensical and not the least bit engaging. Here's hopingNip/Tuckregains its mojo in season four.--Ellen A.

{"description": "A disturbing film about a young Belgian couple and their newborn child,L'Enfanttells a heartbreaking tale that is less about love than about the possibility of moral redemption. We quickly learn what kind of people Sonia and Bruno are. Sonia (Deborah Francois) is a sweet teenager who has just given birth to Bruno's (Jeremie Renier) child. Instead of visiting her and seeing their baby in the hospital, Bruno sublets her apartment to \"friends\" who slam the door in her face when she tries to return home. We do not know what Sonia does for a living, but we know she's diligent enough to maintain a small apartment and keep her pantry stocked with instant soup. Bruno, on the other hand, refuses to take a job. Instead, he leads a gang of thieves who're approximately half his age (and height). Still, Sonia loves him. And Bruno, who may be incapable of love, enjoys the carefree benefits of having a girlfriend who doesn't expect too much. All this changes when Bruno does the unthinkable--he sells their child. He calmly explains to her, \"I thought we'd have another.\" Overnight, Sonia changes from a little girl to a bitter woman who no longer excuses Bruno's behavior. When he returns to her apartment claiming he loves her, she spits back, \"You're lying. You can't help it.\" Not realizing the irony of his own actions, he then begs her for money. Renier and Francois are formidable actors who convey feelings with subtle nuances. Though the film is in French, the viewer never feels lost. The subtitles certainly help, but the actors are so good that their intonations and expressions speak volumes themselves.L'Enfant--a 2005 Cannes winner by filmmaking brothers Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne--is a brutal film to watch not because of any gore or violence, but because of the frailty of the characters and their desperation to survive. In his quest to return the child to Sonia, Bruno attempts to become a better human being. But the viewer is never left with the satisfaction of knowing that he will ever be able to truly redeem himself.--Jae-Ha Kim", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002U6DVOY", "B0001JXP16", "B0083V2VZ0", "B0083V2W18", "B00AIBZLHS", "B00A8QDI1Y", "B0083V2VXC", "B00HVOFP6W", "B002BWP4A6", "B00151QYE4", "B00000F7E6", "B00JVQ7QTM", "B00K0MM4AM", "B00A8QDHUQ", "B0001EFUFK", "B0000C9JFO", "B000I8OOG0", "B0087OULO6", "B00092ZLEY", "B00GPPXNLC", "B00HE010QM", "B00IGK6TH4", "B00AIBZLR8", "B00GPPXNQ2", "B00HE011DE", "B00HRJVHEK", "B00009OOFG", "B000B9EYFW", "B0083V2W54", "B004Q0CHB0", "B002AG2NTI", "B009VO9XSG", "B0084O26SI", "B000YAA68W", "B00006ADG1", "B002BWP3UC", "B0002KQOH6", "B000P6R9NK", "B0036TGTDO", "B002AFX53C", "B00002RAPT", "B00080Z53O", "B00005JKJA", "B0035ECHIG", "B003ICZW7S", "B001152TL6", "B00GPPXP6A", "B00005UK01", "B0000B1A5P", "B00002VWE0", "B0036TGSJE", "B000059TON", "B0000C2IQP", "B00023P4N8", "B0006GAOJA", "6305362688", "B00HVOFP9O", "B000PKG6O4", "0780618564", "B00HVOFP08", "B00HXH00ZI", "B00005N8A9", "B0007OCG5G", "B0041KKYF6", "B001MPS7GG", "B004SUDQ22", "B00003CXKS", "B000296E7W", "B005MXQD74", "B00HB3AP9A", "0767812158", "B002E2M5IC", "6305744114", "0671604295", "B00005J75R", "B00AZNEVNE", "B00GPPXNIK", "B000OVLBGC", "B000I8OMEY", "B00FGVRZOM", "B0002DB52M", "B00007J5VT", "B00005JL57", "B00009MEA0", "B0029O0BK4", "B0077E8RFC", "B00GA9F2PI", "B00421IR5I", "B001QFYCZM", "B00FGVRZR4", "0231163290", "B008CJ0JS4", "B000A5044C", "B00004TBFS", "B00005M2C7", "6305081034", "B0054QHHHE", "B006TTC5MM", "B001EOQCMG"], "bought_together": ["B002U6DVOY", "B0001JXP16"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00A8QDI1Y", "B001THZAAI", "B0083V2W18", "B00151QYE4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 123246}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.99, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B000G0O5IM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/519ND3S0K4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "L'enfant (The Child)"}

Lola (Chiwetel Ejiofor)--a drag queen also known as Simon--finds her shoe salvation in straight-laced Charlie Price (Joel Edgerton), who has inherited his father's shoe factory. Unable to pay the bills making traditional loafers and wingtips, Charlie agrees to make Lola a pair of kinky boots that turn out to be so fabulous the pair end up going into business together. They face a few obstacles, such as the bawdy union workers who aren't too keen on taking orders from a drag queen who's more of a man than they are. Then there's Charlie's posh real estate girlfriend, who wants to convert the factory into pricey condos.

{"description": "Forget any off-screen impressions you may have of Mel Gibson, and experience Apocalypto as the mad, bloody runaway train that it is. The story is set in the pre-Columbian Maya population: one village is brutally overrun, its residents either slaughtered or abducted, by a ruling tribe that needs slaves and human sacrifices. We focus on the capable warrior Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood), although Gibson skillfully sketches a whole population of characters--many of whom don't survive the early reels. Most of the film is set in the dense jungle, but the middle section, in a grand Mayan city, is a dazzling triumph of design, costuming, and sheer decadent terror. The movie itself is a triumph of brutality, as Gibson lets loose his well-established fascination with bodily mortification in a litany of assaults including impalement, evisceration, snakebite, and bee stings. It's a dark, disgusted vision, but Gibson doesn't forget to apply some very canny moviemaking instincts to the violence--including the creation of a tremendous pair of villains (strikingly played by Raoul Trujillo and Rodolfo Palacias). The film is in a Maya dialect, subtitled in English, and shot on digital video (which occasionally betrays itself in some blurry quick pans). Amidst all the mayhem, nothing in the film is more devastating than a final wordless exchange of looks between captured villager Blunted (Jonathan Brewer) and his wife's mother (Maria Isabel Diaz), a superb change in tone from their early relationship. Yes, this is an obsessive, crazed movie, but Gibson knows what he's doing. --Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000UVV24M", "B0012Q732O", "B00003CXAF", "B001BNFRB2", "B000VMIILU", "1573623903", "B002O3Z50Q", "B00004XPPG", "6305692688", "B00028HBKM", "B00004RJ71", "B00AEFXKUI", "B002ZG999U", "B0002YLCG0", "B000VKL6ZM", "B002T9H2LA", "B0000542C6", "B0001CNQX0", "B00AEFY5B6", "B00006ADD5", "B00406UK7S", "B004AOECXI", "B004SIP8W0", "B000R9U3B0", "B00008G8LY", "B00001ZWUS", "B000MGB6NM", "B003EYVXXW", "6304711905", "B004HO6HWA", "B000QXDED6", "B0034G4P58", "B0000714BS", "B000XR9L50", "B00005JLQT", "0783230389", "B002VWNIEA", "B00AZNEW5G", "B008MIMWQW", "B003VA3JZY", "B0002DRDIW", "B000AARKOO", "B00BEJL6JK", "B004SIP7TE", "079283366X", "B00005V9HH", "B000M341QE", "B003HKN52U", "B005IUIXCE", "B00275EGWY", "B003UYUQZW", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B002O3Z510", "B002Q4VBPQ", "B002WY65VU", "B000I0RNWU", "B00003CXWV", "B002XMGGK6", "B003NF97NK", "B000QXDCJ2", "B001FB5634", "B001DZOC6Y", "B007STBUHI", "B0000VCZMK", "B0013FDM7E", "B00015YVDG", "B003IY498Y", "6305433925", "B000P0J0AG", "B00005K3NR", "B000O76ZQC", "B003ELKNH2", "B00018D3ZA", "6304821832", "B00AEBBA36", "B009YQJ322", "B00005JL3T", "079284646X", "B002CA68MU", "B00BTYJYR6", "B00AEFYE08", "B000P0J09C", "B005LAIHPE", "B00441GZ1Y", "B001OQCV2E", "B00AEFY0F2", "B000BITV9W", "B004LWZW4M", "B005LAIIRQ", "B00003CXBH", "B000A2WP7O", "B001GCUO0W", "B00005JPD0", "B00AMSLDTM", "B000RTB0R6", "B00005JA8B", "B00009PY4G", "0783226039", "B000B8QG22", "B000069I1I"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001BNFRB2", "B00028HBKM", "B00001ZWUS", "B00004XPPG"]}, "price": 10.55, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 53938}, "asin": "B000GNOKQG", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41yXQu76-NL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Apocalypto (2006) (2007) Rudy Youngblood; Raoul Trujillo; Mel Gibson"}
{"description": "The love life of a woolly mammoth--handled with G-rated delicacy--drives this sequel to the first computer-animated romp in the age of prehistoric mammals. While the firstIce Agetook a delightful premise and suffocated it with a formulaic plot--in which a mammoth named Manfred (voiced by Ray Romano,Everyone Loves Raymond), a sloth named Sid (John Leguizamo,Moulin Rouge!), and a sabre-tooth tiger named Diego (Denis Leary,Rescue Me) helped an abandoned human infant return to its tribe (basically,Three Mammals and a Baby)--the sequel takes the now-familiar setting, gives it a shapeless, episodic storyline, and yet somehow becomes pretty darn entertaining. Faced with the threat of a flood from melting ice, our heroic trio are on the run to escape from their blossoming valley. On the way, they meet a female mammoth (Queen Latifah,Bringing Down the House) who thinks she's an opossum and get menaced by some freshly defrosted carnivo!  rous fish. Add into the mix a herd of lava-worshipping mini-sloths, some Busby Berkeley-style vultures, and more ingenious slapstick featuring the acorn-crazed Scrat, andIce Age: The Meltdownwill amuse even jaded adults. --Bret FetzerBeyondIce Age: The MeltdownIce Age - Super Cool EditionIce Age & Ice Age 2: The Meltdown - (DVD 2-Pack)Funtastic Adventures Collection Box Set (Ice Age / Robots / Fern Gully / Once Upon a Rainforest)Stills fromIce Age: The Meltdown(click for larger image)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001GCUNWQ", "B005LAIISA", "B0006UEVT0", "B005QODEEE", "B000AY74OG", "B001NCDFTW", "B004HO6I4M", "B000UVKGPI", "B000MV9026", "B00005JMQZ", "B005LAIHW2", "B00CWM58WY", "B0039N74CW", "B0006JMLRK", "B00005JNQS", "B00CHVJODE", "B002WJI2QQ", "B002ZG9904", "B000L22SG6", "B00365F6I2", "B00BG0RSJ4", "B0042U94UQ", "B008JFUQ16", "B000M343BC", "B001ECQ75A", "B001DPHDCY", "B00JK531ES", "B0013FSWT2", "B001GCUO7A", "B001FTIJS0", "B001GCUNW6", "B0012EM5D8", "B00G5G7EXY", "B009PPO78W", "B00005JNS0", "B00E00OGE2", "B00E9ZATJO", "B0030IIZ4M", "B00007LVCM", "B0030IIYYS", "B000VBJEEG", "B000FQISFS", "B00ALMNCLQ", "B004EPZ034", "0783231474", "B00003CXJ4", "B002ZG97YM", "B00AFEX83C", "B00F522C7C", "B000H7JCK0", "B0046A9RMM", "B00HLTD2OE", "B0013FSL3E", "B00947N6D8", "B001U3D88M", "B001PR0YEE", "B00275EHJG", "B001HN6918", "B00GRZPQCO", "B004EPZ0AC", "B008YWY0HK", "B0090SI1RM", "B004G600A4", "B001HN6922", "B0000AOX0O", "B00LG6YEKE", "B003TJM6I8", "B0000VV4W2", "B001KVZ6FW", "B00GDT5T9Y", "B00005JN4W", "B00EV1YZ96", "B004LWZW7Y", "B00029LO0Y", "B004HO6HXY", "B001OMU6UM", "B002XODB66", "B000SJQQPQ", "B005LAIH4A", "B00AEFXMSS", "B000BITUVG", "B000RMJ4F8", "B005F96UJ6", "B005SDUV4E", "B003Y5H5AG", "B004EPZ048", "B001APZMJS", "B009PQCR74", "B003H9M1Q2", "B0000CABKY", "B000AAF1TU", "B00004R99F", "B00CTQWJEI", "B00EPH8SFI", "B0000AK7AA", "B003UESJF6", "B00EBBGLFC", "B0034G4OYA", "B005KG4EFG", "B00H7KJTMG"], "bought_together": ["B001GCUNWQ", "B005LAIISA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005LAIISA", "B001GCUNWQ", "B0006UEVT0", "B00CWM58WY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 30729}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.4, "brand": "Fox Home Entertainment", "asin": "B000GUJYZQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518KJJQ5ZNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Ice Age - The Meltdown (Full Screen Edition)"}

{"description": "A fast-paced romantic comedy,S&#xF3;lo con tu parejawas director Alfonso Cuar&#xF3;n's ticket to a bright and promising future. Inspired by the classic screwball comedies of Ernst Lubitsch, this social satire (the title translates as \"Only with Your Partner\") was Cuar&#xF3;n's feature debut, but because it was a state-funded film that poked fun at Mexican culture, it was initially withheld from release by the Mexican government, only to become a critical and popular success when it was finally released in Mexico in 1991. (It wasn't released in the U.S. until 2006.) A remarkably polished debut, it offered ample proof that Cuar&#xF3;n was a talent to watch, as proven by the films Cuar&#xF3;n would later direct both in and out of Hollywood, includingA Little Princess(1995),Great Expectations(1998),Y tu mam&#xE1; tambi&#xE9;n(2001),Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban(2004), and the near-future thrillerChildren of Men(2006). The talent behind those later films is fully evident here, and from a lively script by his brother Carlos, Cuar&#xF3;n concocts a frothy farce about a reckless playboy named Tom&#xE1;s (Daniel Gim&#xE9;nez Cacho, from Almodovar'sBad Education) whose bed-hopping catches up with him when his latest conquest, a sexy nurse, falsely checks the \"positive\" box on his latest AIDS test to curtail Tom&#xE1;s's rampant womanizing.Now wait a minute... this is a comedy with AIDS humor, from 1991? This was certainly a bold move from the Cuar&#xF3;n brothers, but the humor is handled with graceful style, and as Tom&#xE1;s grows affectionately obsessed with a gorgeous neighbor in his Mexico City apartment building, his once-thriving love life grows increasingly (and comedically) complicated. The casting is flawless, the slapstick humor is impeccably timed, and the film is technically blessed by the brilliant cinematography of Emmanuel Lubezki, who supervised this high-definition digital transfer to DVD, and who followed Cuar&#xF3;n on a mutual path to international acclaim. Thematically enriched by Mozart'sDon Giovanni(heard throughout the soundtrack),S&#xF3;lo con tu parejacan now be appreciated as a well-crafted launching pad for one of the most consistently impressive filmmakers of the early 21st century.--Jeff ShannonOn the DVDThe Criterion Collection supplements forS&#xF3;lo con tu parejaare nearly as enjoyable as the film itself. \"MakingS&#xF3;lo con tu pareja\" is a 30-minute documentary (2006) featuring in-depth interviews with Alfonso and Carlos Cuar&#xF3;n and lead actor Daniel Gim&#xE9;nez Cacho. Also included isCuarteto para el fin del tiempo, a short written and directed by Alfonso Cuar&#xF3;n when he was a film student in 1983; another short film,Noche de bodas(\"Wedding Night\"), written and directed for Mexican television by Carlos Cuar&#xF3;n in 2000; and the original theatrical trailer forS&#xF3;lo con tu pareja. In the accompanying 28-page booklet, an essay by scholar Ryan F. Long examines the film from the perspective of Mexican culture and politics, and Carlos Cuar&#xF3;n contributes a detailed character history of Tom&#xE1;s that was written so Daniel Gim&#xE9;nez Cacho could thoroughly understand the character he was playing. (Other character profiles are available on the Criterion Collection Web site.) It's a fascinating piece of background history, demonstrating the care and detail that went into the creation of this highly enjoyable comedy.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000BOH904", "B00005JL57", "6304698623", "B00HE011DE", "B00HE010QM", "B00GPPXNQ2", "B00IGK6T9W", "B00HVOFP6W", "B001YV502C", "B004MOJW0E", "B00GPPXNLC", "B0012Z362Q", "B00JPUUSEE", "B00GPPXNEE", "B00GPPXP6A", "B00J2PQZRQ", "B005HK13OK", "B00IGK6TGU", "B00HE00ZIQ", "B00005JLQW", "B00GBT637S", "B009VO9XSG", "B00H9L28OO", "B00I4X8KU2", "B00HE01030", "B00HVOFP12", "B00E1S1MMM", "B00HRISNPM", "B001EOQCL2", "B00371QQ8Y", "B009GIGY3E", "B00F98FOI6", "B00HVOFP9O", "B001CW7ZSA", "B001WLMOG4", "B002VECLXC", "B00HVOFP08", "B00JPUUSSU", "B000VARC32", "B00005NC66", "B008S2NABI", "B00007CVS3", "B006OB3K56", "B000QXDFR6", "B000E1OI80", "B003KGBISE", "B00HE010LC", "B007A4Y1Q8", "B007UW9W32", "B00AX7PGQS", "B000EZ9084", "B00DZP1BY6", "B00H9HZITU", "B000C8Q900", "B0026VBOJW", "B000N6TX1I", "1559409053", "B00IGK6TLA", "B000BR6QIW", "B0026VBOJ2", "B00005N7Z1", "B000MTEFPK", "B009RWRIP2", "B002H0LCGM", "B00005A8TU", "B000Q6ZG5C", "B004OOL73W", "B002M2T1V8", "B000XPSC0W", "B00L3ZB3Y8", "B0029O0BK4", "B003KGBIS4", "B005HK13SG", "B0057GYODG", "B0007WFYC0", "B00005UQ7Q", "B004CIIXDM", "B00393SFU2", "B00005N8A9", "B0035G5IOE", "0780023536", "B008Y5OWKW", "B004NWPY34", "B0007OCG60", "B008CB8CJK", "B004JOBATI", "B00009W0U4", "B00005JM80", "B00A8QDIMS", "B001CW7ZSU", "B0043VUHV4", "B00005JLHW", "B00AQ6J5JU", "B0012Z363A", "0783228457", "B00007ELDG", "B001UV4XC4", "B00AEFYVUQ", "B000069CF9", "B0083V2W4U"], "bought_together": ["6304698623"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005JL57", "B0002TT0MI", "6304698623", "B000N6TX1I"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 206329}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 18.6, "brand": "Image Entertainment", "asin": "B000H5U5R6", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5132WQVMRSL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Solo Con Tu Pareja (The Criterion Collection)"}
{"description": "Through its simplicity and scrupulous attention to historical detail,Sophie Scholl: The Final Daysproves to be both thrillingly suspenseful and emotionally devastating. During the peak of the Third Reich, Sophie Scholl (Julia Jentsch,The Edukators), along with her brother Hans and other students in Munich, formed a resistance group called the White Rose and distributed anti-Nazi leaflets.Sophie Schollbegins on a crisp winter day, with Sophie and Hans distributing leaflets around the empty halls of a university before class is let out.  The tension only increases as they are arrested, interrogated, and swiftly convicted in a brutal show trial. The heart of the film are the scenes between Sophie and her interrogator, Robert Mohr (Gerald Alexander Held), a loyal Nazi who nonetheless respected and perhaps even admired Sophie.  Their arguments, distilled down from hours of historical record, crackle with emotion and resonate throughout history, from Communist totalitarianism to the Bush administration condemning critics of the Iraq war as traitors. Jentsch's restrained performance only grows more and more moving over the movie's course.

{"description": "BetweenSnakes On A PlaneandFarce of the Penguins, one really wonders what Samuel Jackson has been smoking. This Jackson-narrated mockmentary ofMarch of the Penguins, written and directed by Bob Saget (America's Funniest Home Videos), highlights the penguins' lascivious side, as the male's march inland to find mating partners. Overdubbed with human voices,Farcestars three penguins, Carl (Bob Saget), a neurotic, insecure bird whose search for true love has so far been in vain, Jimmy (Lewis Black), a mobster-like father figure who encourages Carl to keep up hope, and Marcus (Tracy Morgan), a smooth, African American penguin with a self-professed huge penis. Miles away, as the men journey inward, fighting off seals and engaging in therapy sessions with snowy owls along the way, Vicky (Mo'nique) tells Melissa (Christina Applegate) that someday her Prince Charming will come, which, predictably, he does. Watching penguins discussing the meaning of life, questioning their annual masochistic hike through tundra, or wondering if they have eating disorders is funny for about ten minutes. Samuel Jackson, the ultimate omniscient narrator, furthering the story between scenes is also odd and laughable. ButFarce of The Penguinsrelies on its lewd humor for laughs, and though it is disarming to see waddling birds cuss,Farce'sone-liner gets old. Yes, penguins have sex.Farce of the Penguinsis a fun idea perhaps taken too far. Nonetheless, there is always something pleasing about anthropomorphizing animals, especially for lovers of crude sex jokes.--Trinie Dalton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000C3L2NE", "B000K7UBSO", "B000BI5KV0", "B001UV4XGA", "B000X1Z0C4", "B00008AOVL", "0345519876", "B000BTITKS", "B002T4GWWA", "B004O8OLO0", "B004SIP9I8", "B004SIP9E2", "B004BR7XGM", "B008JFUPPI", "B0002C9DK4", "B000QEIOSU", "B004EP43SM", "B0002IQMAM", "B001QB9H10", "6305133409", "B000069CF0", "B004ULNJIU", "B001QB9H1K", "B009AMAJPA", "B007EQR0D8", "B002O3Z4Y8", "0767836316", "B000065V3G", "B000260NTK", "B004SEUJ0A"], "bought_together": ["B000BI5KV0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000BI5KV0", "B008MIL45M"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 71641}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.98, "brand": "Image Entertainment", "asin": "B000JJSJD2", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51pDyTCGpUL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Farce of the Penguins"}
{"description": "Out patrolling a California highway, police officer Edward Malus (Nicolas Cage) stops a station wagon to return a little girl's lost doll. Moments later, a runaway truck slams into the station wagon, igniting it into a fiery wreck with the mother and child trapped inside. Edward fails to save them before the car explodes...and then spends months of his life choking down pills to get the image of their faces out of his head. But Edward is about to get a second chance. A desperate letter from his former girlfriend, Willow (Kate Beahan), arrives at his home with no postmark. Willow came into his life and left just as unexpectedly years before. But now, her daughter Rowan has gone missing, and Edward is theonly person she trusts to help locate her. She asks him to come to her home on a private island - Summersisle - a place with its own traditions where people observe a forgotten way of life. Edward seizes the opportunity to make his life right again, and soon finds himself on a seaplane bound for the islands of the Pacific Northwest. But nothing is what it seems on isolated Summersisle, where a culture, dominated by its matriarch Sister Summersisle (Ellen Burstyn), is bound together by arcane traditions and a pagan festival called \"the Day of Death and Rebirth.\" The secretive people of Summersisle only ridicule his investigation, insisting that a child named Rowan never existed there... or if she ever did was no longer alive. But what Edward doesn't know is that Willow's plea for help has invited more into his life than a chance for redemption. In unraveling Summersisle's closely held secrets, Edward is drawn into a web of ancient traditions and murderous deceit, and each step he takes closer to the lost child brings him one step closer to the unspeakable. And one step closer to the Wicker Man.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001J710Y8", "B000PMFRZQ", "B002TVQ48K", "B000GRUMRS", "B0073U2ETK", "B001J710Z2", "B004EPYZOO", "B00012QLB4", "B000TGJ8CQ", "B001KRVLCI", "B000CSUNQQ", "B001GCUO02", "B00AEBB8JM", "B000CFYAMC", "6304806434", "B004XFZ4JK", "B000OVLBF8", "B000BBOUW2", "B000BYA5G4", "B000059TG6", "B004EI2NMM", "B00BFNJHCI", "B00004Z4WR", "B001KKU9CI", "0792838068", "6304711891", "B003ZD9DSO", "B00BJB2GZG", "B00003CXIV", "6305760403", "B00BTYMPX6", "B000U7169M", "B00IKM5LXG", "B001DZOC6Y", "B007IUEEA2", "B00062IDGK", "B00003CXXG", "B003YF9PX6", "B00092ZLSK", "B00005JLRE", "B000TJ6PBK", "B00441GZ00", "B005F2JRUC", "0792844831", "B000FI8MPW", "B0000AGWMF", "B00005JN5E", "0767810856", "B000YNFXZA", "B000OVLBGM", "B00006LPGP", "B00020HAX8", "B0010YVCB6", "B0009X763M", "B00005JP3R", "B000RZGHSM", "B000EHRVP6", "B00008L3UF", "B000286S1U", "B00DNJ95S8", "B009L79YFU", "B00KCTG4PO", "B005DR64OQ", "B0019X3YX2", "B000RZGHSW", "B00406UK7S", "B000JLTRIQ", "B003UMW63O", "B0047T74CM", "B000ALM40I", "B008XAT0TQ", "B002GHHHKG", "B009XTF8KQ", "B001OST0M6", "B009IV2Z3M", "B002ZG99KO", "B00E8G5HNM", "B0002DB5PO", "B00HOGBXS6", "B008DVJOQ4", "B004SIP92O", "B00AEBBA2W", "B00I9H3VTS", "B0011NVC98", "B001JNNDJM", "B000W1SZA4", "B00FEHCQEC", "B00AEFYYH6", "B005LAIGW8", "B00005JNNT", "B004CQZFH6", "B000U1ZV62", "B000RGN2JI", "B003L20IEW", "B00006FDBT", "B00004Y87O", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00803PFZO", "B00GOYC3I8"], "bought_together": ["B001J710Y8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001J710Y8", "B00004Z4WR", "B002TVQ48K", "B000PMFRZQ"]}, "price": 9.33, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 75218}, "asin": "B000JYW5DM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51TT3AM10VL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Wicker Man (Full Screen Unrated/Rated Edition)"}
{"description": "What Agatha Christie did for genteel spinsters with her intrepid crime-solver Miss Marple, G.K. Chesterton did with the splendid Father Brown, a bumbling yet wily cleric in 1920s England, bumping into and then solving the most outlandish crimes. This boxed set includes seven full-length episodes ofFather Brown(shown in the U.S. on PBS) in all his twinkly, slightly clueless glory.The Curse of the Golden Crossis a particular gem, ambitious in its story of an American archeologist who receives eerie death threats from a hidden competitor (or is it a ghost?) upon his discovery of an important ancient cross. As the archeologist returns to England to view what is reportedly a second, heretofore unknown cross, dug up at a country church, an upper crust entourage gathers 'round him--and Father Brown, of course--as he makes his way to the site. \"A curse! How splendid!\" says one aging flapper upon learning that the newest find may have crossed the gods in an irrevocable way. Despite the varying production values (the show switches from film for outdoor shots to video for indoors), the intricate plots (mistaken identities, hidden adultery, faked suicides) make for a very satisfying armchair detective experience.

{"description": "First screened in Europe and scheduled for limited release in the U.S.,The Illusionistoffers welcome proof that \"arthouse\" quality needn't be limited to the arthouses. Set in turn-of-the-century Vienna, this stately, elegant period film benefited from a crossover release in mainstream cinemas, and showed considerable box-office staying power--granted, teenage mallrats and lusty males may have been drawn to the allure ofSeventh Heavenalumna Jessica Biel, who rises to the occasion with a fine performance. But there's equal appeal in the casting of Edward Norton and Paul Giamatti, who bring their formidable talents to bear on the intriguing tale of a celebrated magician named Eisenheim (Norton) whose stage performance offends the Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell), a vindictive lout who aims to marry Duchess Sophie (Biel), Eisenheim's childhood friend and now, 15 years later, his would-be lover. This romantic rivalry and Eisenheim's increasingly enigmatic craft of illusion are investigated by Chief Inspector Uhl (Giamatti), who's under Leopold's command and is therefore not to be trusted as Eisenheim and Sophie draw closer to their inevitable reunion. Cleverly adapted by director Neil Burger from Steven Millhauser's short story \"Eisenheim the Illusionist,\" and boasting exquisite production values and a fine score by Philip Glass,The Illusionistis the kind of class act that fully deserved its unusually wide and appreciative audience. --Jeff ShannonBeyondThe Illusionist\"Eisenheim the Illusionist\" and Other StoriesPaul Giamatti in a More Loveable RoleMagic Kits & AccessoriesStills fromThe Illusionist", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000LC55F2", "B000NOIX48", "B002ZG980U", "B002WNU0QW", "B00DWZHTOU", "B001MZ5W3M", "B00011CZRE", "B000H0MKI8", "B00008K7AO", "B000L212HC", "B00AEBB8NI", "B000GFLKF8", "B000O76ZO4", "B00003CXZ4", "B00005JLSB", "B000FKO5QK", "B000M341QE", "B00AEFXGIY", "B00005V9HH", "B00AEBB8LA", "B00005JMOW", "B00096S49Y", "0767847415", "6305313687", "B004SIP9Z6", "B0047T74CM", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B000R4SMCW", "B0002YLCG0", "B000P0J0EW", "B000HEWEE4", "B0041KKYHE", "B00BBI7EZY", "B00AEBBA2W", "B000CQLZ0Q", "0783235070", "0767802519", "B002ZG997C", "B00003CXHG", "B004SIP7ZS", "B000069HZP", "B004SIP7PS", "B003ASLJQI", "B00177Y9ZC", "B00005JLKN", "B003ZW9H68", "B001N44BVQ", "B002O3Z50Q", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00005JN2Z", "B00AEBB86A", "B00000F4ZY", "B000MZHW40", "0671686402", "B00BB67UNW", "B005HP2J0M", "B000QXDED6", "B000NIVJF4", "B001F12J0C", "B000N6TX1I", "B000LAZE8C", "B00080ZG10", "B005LAIGRS", "B0009MDPYM", "0792159659", "B000OYC7BW", "B001UV4XGU", "B004AOECXI", "0767818105", "B000XR9L50", "B0018O4YT0", "B00015YVDG", "B004SIP8JI", "B00004XPPG", "B00006ZXSK", "B001DHXT20", "B0000AC8LR", "B009B8YMB0", "0783229402", "B0006210ZG", "B001PPGAIA", "B00004BZIY", "B008JFURII", "B00005JPAR", "B00006ADFM", "B004SIP7TE", "B000F5GNX8", "B000FS9FCG", "B006P0FIGU", "B00005JMCN", "B002VWNID6", "B004XQO90O", "B004EPZ084", "B00AEBB9M8", "B000P5FH3K", "B00005JNY3", "B000063US3", "B003L20IG0"], "bought_together": ["B000LC55F2", "B002ZG980U"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000LC55F2", "B005LAIHXQ", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00DV2MVWO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 60145}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.0, "brand": "Twentieth Century Fox", "asin": "B000K7VHPU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51nYghoS63L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Illusionist (Full Screen Edition)"}
{"description": "World War I aviation action gets an impressive digital upgrade inFlyboys, a welcome addition to the \"dogfight\" sub-genre that includes such previous war-in-the-air films likeHell's Angels,Wings, andThe Blue Max. While those earlier films had the advantage of real and genuinely dangerous flight scenes (resulting, in some cases, in fatal accidents during production),Flyboystakes full (and safe) advantage of the digital revolution, with intensely photo-realistic recreations of WWI aircraft, authentic period structures, and CGI environments requiring a total of 850 digital effects shots, resulting in an abundance of amazing images, many of them virtually indistinguishable from reality. Unfortunately, the film's technical achievement is more impressive than its screenplay, which conventionally and predictably tells the fact-based story, set in France in 1916, of the daring young pilots of the Lafayette Escadrille, a pioneering French air-combat unit that welcomed American enlistees prior to the United States' entry into the war.There's a familiar clich&#xE9; to match every thrilling scene of aerial combat, but director Tony Bill manages to keep it all interesting, from the romance between a young American maverick (James Franco) and a pretty French girl (newcomer Jennifer Decker) to the exciting action in the air, which includes a stock variety of heroes (many of them composites of real-life WWI pilots) and an intimidating villain known only as \"The Black Falcon,\" whose Fokker Dr-1 triplane (one of many in the film) recalls the exploits of German \"ace of aces\" Manfred von Richtofen, the dreaded \"Red Baron\" of legend. With impeccable production values that will impress even the most nit-picking aviation buffs,Flyboys(likeSuperman ReturnsandApocalypto, also released in 2006) was also one of the first feature films to be shot with Panavision's state-of-the-art Genesis digital cameras, resulting in beautiful images that meet or exceed the visual nuance of film.Flyboysalso benefits from painstaking attention to physical detail, making it easier to forgive its shortcomings as a generic and formulaic slice of romanticized history. So while some viewers may have wished for a more realistic and grown-up depiction of the Lafayette Escadrille, it's safe to say thatFlyboyswill be thrilling its target audience for many years to come.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0039USJBK", "B005411P6I", "B005LAIGNC", "B000WC39RW", "B000J6I0TS", "B000JSI7C6", "B00HS66C5Q", "B004SIP81Q", "B00AEFXV8O", "B00008AOTN", "B000JVSUS4", "B00IKPXX92", "B00BWJQEFS", "B004ZJZQFG", "B004TJ1H0A", "B00L4K3MLE", "B00AEBB9O6", "B00JG88XD8", "B007LNBRKQ", "B000VDDWDS", "B004UMAPUO", "B00DL48CN4", "B000OCZD5Q", "B000K0YLMS", "B000WC39SG", "B00IVLR9LI", "B000O77QD8", "B009A87ZKG", "B000O77RLE", "B00HLTD49C", "B000KN9F5I", "B001U6YI8S", "B00AEBBA0Y", "B00J11U4T6", "B000G0O5N2", "B000K0YLMI", "B00K2CHWYI", "B00000F2UF", "B00JL6L4WC", "B003LL3N1I", "B00AEFXRMO", "B00HEPEBWC", "B002GHHHPQ", "B000PAAJVA", "B005OOSQ7Q", "B00AEBB9T6", "B001XURJCS", "B000VZGK3K", "B00AIBZMM2", "B00H83EV5W", "B00BWH6DBA", "B000YKYT6M", "B000GRU0A2", "B000Y5CHIE", "B00AEFYCQO", "B00JA3RPAG", "B000O176IO", "B001LRJH0K", "B00BN3DUVE", "B00J11U5CW", "B002ZG97RY", "B00121QGUO", "B000E1ZKJQ", "B000JSI7AS", "B000F9RB94", "B0076YFJUY", "B00HWWUQYY", "B00IYJFB2G", "B001PPGAIK", "B00HW3L2R8", "B00HF98SNK", "B00HEEAM94", "B00IQAUO4S", "B000M2E30O", "B008JFUNNM", "B00GICP84W", "B005FUTC1I", "B000KX0ISQ", "B0049GYXH2", "B0002MHE1O", "B000ICLRHU", "B00KPP6ZLS", "B000ICLRJ8", "B00AEBB8BA", "B000ICLRIE", "B008JFUO4U", "B00AEBBA1S", "B00A29HFMU", "B005NFJAT4", "B0064NTZ6W", "B00E2083J4", "B00275EGX8", "B00487HQUI", "B00AEFXYCC", "B00406UK5A", "B000JUB7LW", "B0039USJBA", "B006WXHJGC", "B0049GYXEA", "B00GMV8JEA"], "bought_together": ["B0039USJBK", "B000WC39RW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005LAIGNC", "B000ESSSGG", "B00HS66C5Q", "B0039USJBK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 40109}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.79, "brand": "TCFHE/MGM", "asin": "B000KX0HIC", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51M87D5T6WL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Flyboys [Blu-ray]"}
{"description": "In his aim to make an honest film about sex, John Cameron Mitchell (Hedwig and the Angry Inch) has taken a somewhat documentary approach toShortbus, a film describing various New Yorkers' sexual pathos. Framed by shots roving a homemade diorama of the city,Shortbusis comprised of vignettes featuring actors who helped craft this story of people's disconnect in sexual endeavors. Jamie (PJ DeBoy) and James (Paul Dawson), a gay couple experiencing a lull in their relationship, visit Sophia (Sook-Yin Lee), a sex therapist whose inability to orgasm results in her clients inviting her to a sex club after which the film is titled. Sophia's husband, Rob (Raphael Barker), is also willing to experiment, so the two independently embark on adventures in self-pleasure. Dominatrix Severin (Lindsay Beamish) plays a crucial role in Sophia and Rob's lives, as her search for real humanity overlaps with their desire for passion. As each character's plot complicates, the viewer sees a similar melancholy bulldozing its way into these seemingly disparate lives. The depression is repeatedly used in comedic scenes, such as when James is asked on a date while still hospitalized for his attempted suicide. Yo La Tengo's score, which includes Animal Collective among others, lends this film a graceful ambience.

{"description": "Flushed Awayis a rip-roaring nautical adventure with a twist: The heroes are a pair of rodents braving the sewers underneath London. Roddy (voiced by Hugh Jackman) is an upper-crust house-mouse who finds himself flushed into the subterranean sewers. Eager to return to his posh home, he enlists the help of a boat-captain rat named Rita (Kate Winslet), who has troubles of her own; namely the kingpin of the underworld, the Toad (Ian McKellen), and his henchmen including the French mercenary Le Frog (Jean Reno).While technicallyFlushed Awaycould be considered part of the wave of celebrity-voiced, anthropomorphic-animal movies that hit in 2005-2006 (Madagascar,Over the Hedge,The Wild, etc.), it doesn't inspire the same sense of d&#xE9;j&#xE0; vu. For one thing, its voice actors are less recognizable than the likes of Bruce Willis and Chris Rock. For another, its look is very distinctive. Like Nick Park'sChicken RunandWallace and Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit, it's a joint production of DreamWorks Animation and Aardman Features, and although Park isn't involved, it retains his trademark blocky look of clay animation. But animating the movie by computer rather than by hand allows for some eye-popping tableaux, such as floodwaters rushing through the sewers and an entire town of little animated characters. It's a crazy thrill ride loaded with inside jokes and enough crude humor to earn a PG rating, and the band of singing slugs is also a hoot.--David HoriuchiOn the DVDIt's no surprise that the singing slugs are the stars of the DVD's bonus features. They're featured in two music videos (less than a minute total), and in a 13-minute segment an Aardman animator builds a slug out of plasticine.  (In contrast, the lesson on drawing Roddy is a mere two minutes.) A song jukebox jumps to 10 musical points in the film, though the non-slug background music isn't really worth the jump. On the human side, there are eight-minute featurettes on the music and the voices, a set-top game that is easier to control than most such featurettes (and easier to beat too), and a commentary track by directors David Bowers and Sam Fell in which they have a grand old time remembering their inside jokes and showering love on the Spike and Whitey characters. The DVD-ROM has access to 21 more online games.--David HoriuchiFun Facts fromFlushed AwayIn Tabitha's room, there are a variety of dolls from previous DreamWorks Animation films, including a Gromit and several bunnies fromWallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,an Alex the Lion fromMadagascar,and a Dragon fromShrek.Many characters from past films make cameos inFlushed Away.For example, aChicken Runchicken is on the second page of the Toad&#x92;s scrapbook, Gromit&#x92;s head is a pencil top in the Jammy Dodger, the penguin fromWallace and Gromit: The Wrong Trousersis on a stamp on the Jammy Dodger, and a poster ofWallace and Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbitis on the side of a bus in Kensington.There are officially 60 million rats in the UK.  That&#x92;s one rat for every person.The various boats in the film are made up of flotsam and jetsam that rats could conceivably find in the sewer.For the double decker bus:Ice chest, retro flipping numbers alarm clock, bike lamp, buckle, oil drum, soup can, license plate, rope, plastic suitcase, jerry can.For the mini cooper: Soda can, battery,  sardine can, butter knife, old lights.Simulating the toilet water and making it look realistic proved to be a challenge.  After much consideration, it was finally discovered that what was missing was caustics, or the use of light reflection off the bottom of the bowl.  This was added and everyone was happy because they could finally get their mind out of the toilet.Stills fromFlushed Away(click for larger image)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0012EM5D8", "B0006JMLRK", "B00003CXJ4", "B00005JNQS", "B002WJI2QQ", "B001DPHDCY", "B001U3D88M", "B0000640SC", "B000H7JCK0", "B00CWM58WY", "B004HO6I4M", "B005SDUV4E", "0783231474", "B001PR0YEE", "B004EPZ034", "B001GCUO7A", "B000RMJ4F8", "B0006UEVT0", "B001LPWGFA", "B000CZ0PT4", "B00029LO0Y", "B000BITUVG", "B000MV9026", "B000ION23A", "B000L22SG6", "B000UVKGPI", "B004AKCME8", "B000DWMYQ8", "B000065V42", "B000MNOX9E", "B000EQ5UHS", "6305161887", "B003UESJF6", "B001ECQ75A", "B000UFIYOO", "B005LAIISA", "B00B7EQPNE", "B00CHVJODE", "B001FTIJS0", "B0000AOX0O", "B002ZG97YM", "B007FF3HQM", "B00003CXG7", "B00E00OGE2", "B004SIPAFK", "B001LXIDTA", "B006JD48LO", "B00E9ZATJO", "B005LAIIT4", "B009AMAH3O", "B00000JL8E", "B00000JGOQ", "B0000VV4W2", "B003E66Y84", "B00EBBGLFC", "B004LWZW7Y", "B001OMU6UM", "B00005JM7T", "B002UOMH00", "B008JFUQ16", "0783219806", "B000IFRT2O", "B005QODEEE", "B001HN6918", "B00007LVCM", "B000GUJZ00", "B00HLTD2OE", "B00005JMFH", "B001NCDFTW", "B001GCUNWQ", "B000G75AZC", "B00JK531ES", "B005LAIIHG", "B0046A9RMM", "B000AY74OG", "B008R65XPQ", "B001NLJ3RG", "B00009YXAW", "B00GRZPQCO", "B001RXDM36", "B0034G4P26", "B004OWQTZ0", "B0052XI5J8", "B0034G4OYA", "B0044RFTCO", "B006VUYJ00", "B001LXIDTK", "B008NNY9QW", "B00LG6YEKE", "B00028HBES", "B000P0J09W", "B000VBJEEG", "B00I6JOD2S", "B0039N74CW", "B00ALMNCLQ", "B001SXZ7T2", "B00CWM5MDY", "B000ROAK2W", "B00AEBB8KQ"], "bought_together": ["B004HO6I4M", "B00CWM58WY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002WJI2QQ", "B004HO6I4M", "B00CWM58WY", "B00003CXJ4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 5311}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.85, "brand": "Dreamworks", "asin": "B000M343BC", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51PGB5ZeCfL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Flushed Away (Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "Christopher Guest (director ofA Mighty Wind,Best in Show, andWaiting for Guffman) and his sparkling troupe of improvisational satirists return with a sardonic look at C-list (or perhaps D- or E-list) actors driven to the brink of madness by the possibility of winning an Academy Award. Marilyn Hack (the ever-brilliant Catherine O'Hara,Beetlejuice), a modestly talented character actress, hears of an Internet rumor that she might be nominated for the dubious movie she's currently making,Home for Purim. Soon buzz is flying about all the rest of the cast (which includes Harry Shearer and Parker Posey) and everyone starts clawing for as much attention as they can get while appearing modest and unambitious. Despite the movie's target being so familiar to them,For Your Considerationis not Guest & Co.'s best work--in an effort to give everyone in the huge cast face time, few of the characters gain any comic traction or have a particularly engaging storyline; the mockery stays on a fairly surface level.  Nonetheless, some of those surfaces are pretty funny: Fred Willard and Jane Lynch are devastating as a pair of predatory infotainment hosts, while Jennifer Coolidge (Legally Blonde) turns in a daffy and surreal performance. Throughout, the movie's anchor is O'Hara; the way her character is virtually crushed by the hype has a surprising richness and depth. She remains a cinematic treasure.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000ALFVD", "B00005LC5D", "B00005ALS0", "6305922756", "B00006HAWL", "B009VY00OC", "B000M341SC", "B00DQEHKZ0", "B000Y5JFN4", "B002HMHSJ0", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B007PXYWBI", "B0045O2PHS", "B001JIE7JC", "B00G7QPXUI", "079073155X", "B001IOQWA4", "B00J8JQ8YG", "B000NO1XG8", "B000055Z4G", "1557836094", "B007UW9W32", "B003102JDM", "B000K7VHQE", "B00008979F", "6305428239", "6305327068", "0780628306", "B00007AJF8", "B00005JLRE", "B002XUL6SA", "B00344EAN2", "B000055Z4H", "B0000640VJ", "B00000K3CS", "B0010X8NF0", "B004A8ZWV0", "B00013WVLC", "B00GNZLZLO", "B000G6BLWE", "B000OU082G", "0780618564", "B0006TPE4C", "B002PLPQLU", "B00004ZEU2", "B008CYDD7I", "B001LXIDUY", "B007L6VR12", "B00026ZEEE", "B00DL48BM6", "B000NIVJFY", "B0007UC8Y4", "B0007QJ1ES", "B001E95ZNS", "B0010DM3R4", "B00AADAEBW", "B00005JPE3", "B00008977D", "B00000JGHT", "0790742071", "B00009W5CA", "B00GPWEPZ8", "6305291470", "B00005JPX8", "B00AMEZDK6", "B00GMV8M2Y", "B00004STRF", "B008220C38", "B000059HA5", "B00DT55OPE", "B00B04NIWM", "B00005JLZW", "B000035Z3C", "B0001907AI", "B005LAIIJY", "B00H9L26AA", "B00AEFY9RG", "B00003CXC3", "B000FS9FD0", "B0000714BP", "B004SIP8ZM", "B000M4RG7E", "B00BTYSIXC", "B00AEFY5B6", "B000286RNE", "B0000VV4OK", "B00004RE27", "B00H7LJ2UO", "B001QFFBAM", "630589423X", "B001FB55KI", "B00GUO2SKA", "B00441GYRO", "B000063K2Q", "B00AEFXN9G", "B002IFUCYE", "B000P5FH5S", "B000LC55F2", "B000055Y0X", "B00007LTIA"], "bought_together": ["B0000ALFVD", "B00005ALS0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005ALS0", "B0000ALFVD", "6305922756", "B00005LC5D"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 29159}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.99, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B000M341Q4", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Zl7Ebbs5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "For Your Consideration (Widescreen)"}
{"description": "Martin Scorsese makes a welcome return to the mean streets (of Boston, in this case) withThe Departed, hailed by many as Scorsese's best film sinceCasino. Since this crackling crime thriller is essentially a Scorsese-stamped remake of the acclaimed 2002 Hong Kong thrillerInfernal Affairs, the film was intensely scrutinized by devoted critics and cinephiles, and while Scorsese's intense filmmaking and all-star cast deserve ample acclaim,The Departedis also worthy of serious re-assessment, especially with regard to what some attentive viewers described as sloppy craftsmanship (!), notably in terms of mismatched shots and jagged continuity. But no matter where you fall on the Scorsese appreciation scale, there's no denying thatThe Departedis a signature piece of work from one of America's finest directors, designed for maximum impact with a breathtaking series of twists, turns, and violent surprises. It's an intricate cat-and-mouse game, but this time the cat and mouse are both moles: Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) is an ambitious cop on the rise, planted in the Boston police force by criminal kingpin Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a hot-tempered police cadet who's been artificially disgraced and then planted into Costello's crime operation as a seemingly trustworthy soldier. As the multilayered plot unfolds (courtesy of a scorching adaptation byKingdom of Heavenscreenwriter William Monahan), Costigan and Sullivan conduct a volatile search for each other (they're essentially looking for \"themselves\") while simultaneously wooing the psychiatrist (Vera Farmiga) assigned to treat their crime-driven anxieties.Such convenient coincidences might sink a lesser film, butThe Departedis so electrifying that you barely notice the plot-holes. And while Nicholson's profane swagger is too much \"Jack\" and not enough \"Costello,\" he's still a joy to watch, especially in a film that's additionally energized by memorable (and frequently hilarious) supporting roles for Alec Baldwin, Mark Wahlberg, and a host of other big-name performers.The Departedalso makes clever and plot-dependent use of cell-phones, to the extent that it couldn't exist without them. Powered by Scorsese's trademark use of well-chosen soundtrack songs (from vintage rock to Puccini's operas),The Departedmay not be perfect, but it's one helluva ride for moviegoers, proving popular enough to become the biggest box-office hit of Scorsese's commercially rocky career.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002ZG99N6", "B000P0J09M", "B004SIP7TE", "B004SIP8ZM", "B002ZG980U", "B002VWNIEA", "B00011CZRE", "B00AEBB8NI", "B002T9H2LA", "B00005JLSB", "B000MZHW40", "B00080ZG10", "B003ASLJQS", "B000P0J0AG", "B000P0J0EW", "B000C20VPA", "B003UESJHO", "B004SIP7ZS", "B003ASLJO0", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B002CPMB9O", "B00AHTYI5M", "B00275EGWY", "B000XR9L50", "B000A3XY5A", "B0007DFJ0G", "B001N44BVQ", "B00003CXWV", "B008MILL8W", "B000286RP2", "B004SIP7VM", "B00005V9HH", "6305313687", "B00AEBB9NM", "B004FQX5B6", "B00AEFXKUI", "B004SIP95G", "B00AEBB86A", "B005LAIIJY", "B0016Q2D66", "B003ASLJQI", "B00008975Z", "B000IY04Q8", "B001P9KR8U", "B00005JNJV", "B000C20VRS", "B008R65XYC", "B005LAIGRS", "B00H9KKGTO", "B00008DP4C", "B00AEBB9F0", "B00AEFY5B6", "B00005JN0W", "B005LAIGLE", "B000A2UBN4", "B002QEHPQU", "B000P0J0EM", "B003UESJH4", "B007D5E7C2", "6304765258", "B000P0J0D8", "B00AEFY0XE", "B00004WG2F", "0767830555", "B000LC55F2", "B002O3Z4Y8", "B004EPYZP8", "B000A7DVR2", "B00005JPD0", "B000WZEZGI", "B00049QQHI", "B000FS9FCG", "B00004XPPB", "B006OFN0SE", "B009AMAL4Y", "B004U7MR14", "B000GFLKF8", "B003AWRMCE", "B0019L770A", "B00BEIYN9Q", "B0000AM6JI", "B004SIP9Z6", "B001GZ6QC4", "0783240295", "B0010DR4BO", "B000065U1N", "B00001ZWUS", "B00BB67UNW", "B0000B1OFL", "B00AEBB9K0", "B00DHDDE32", "B00005JKWX", "B0051MKNV8", "B002ZG97RE", "0767802519", "B0034G4P94", "B00DHHWXYY", "B00005B6JZ", "B00003CXZ4", "B001TODCII"], "bought_together": ["B000P0J09M"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000RETOHY", "B000P0J09M", "B000P0J0EW", "B00AEBB8NI"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 5067}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.5, "brand": "Warner Bros", "asin": "B000M341QE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RZnzpL34L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)"}

Director Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu and his co-writer, Guillermo Arriaga (the two also collaborated onAmores Perrosand21 Grams) weave together the disparate strands of their story into a finely hewn fabric by focusing on what appear to be several equally incongruent characters: an American (Brad Pitt) touring Morocco with his wife (Cate Blanchett) become the focus of an international incident also involving a hardscrabble Moroccan farmer (Mustapha Rachidi) struggling to keep his two young sons in line and his family together. A San Diego nanny (Adriana Barraza), her employers absent, makes the disastrous decision to take their kids with her to a wedding in Mexico. And a deaf-mute Japanese teen (the extraordinary Rinko Kikuchi) deals with a relationship with her father (Koji Yakusho) and the world in general that's been upended by the death of her mother. It is perhaps not surprising, or particularly original, that a gun is the device that ties these people together. YetBabelisn't merely about violence and its tragic consequences. It's about communication, and especially the lack of it--both intercultural, raising issues like terrorism and immigration, and intracultural, as basic as husbands talking to their wives and parents understanding their children. I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu's command of his medium, sound and visual alike, is extraordinary; the camera work is by turns kinetic and restrained, the music always well matched to the scenes, the editing deft but not confusing, and the film (which clocks in at a lengthy 143 minutes) is filled with indelible moments. Many of those moments are also pretty stark and grim, and no will claim that all of this leads to a \"happy\" ending, but there is a sense of reconciliation, perhaps even resolution. \"If You Want to be Understood... Listen,\" goes the tagline. And if you want a movie that will leave you thinking,Babelis it.--Sam GrahamBeyondBabelOther Interweaving Storylines on DVDOther DVDs by Director Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rrituWhy We Love Cate BlanchettStills fromBabel(click for larger image)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0001CNRRU", "B00005N8A9", "B0041KKYF6", "B000A3XY5A", "B000F7CMRM", "B000067IZ3", "B00005JL57", "B00AEFXESQ", "B001P9KR8U", "B000N6TX1I", "B001JIE7JC", "B00005JPKE", "B00AEFXQ9S", "B00005JMJ4", "B0010DR4BO", "B000NIVJF4", "B000NIVJFY", "B000F1IQN2", "B00HF98SPS", "B0045ZAQRS", "B00011CZRE", "B000N3T0DW", "B002O3Z4Z2", "B000MZHW40", "B004SIP6VI", "B0034G4P30", "B008JFUNKU", "B003ASLJQS", "B000E1NXJ0", "B004SIP6GI", "B00AEBB89W", "B00275EGWY", "B000IONJM4", "B00H9KKGTO", "B00003CWTI", "B00080Z53O", "B00005JNCZ", "B00114XTHA", "B00GUO2SKA", "B00112S8RS", "B001PPLJIQ", "B000MXPE7O", "B00102F5WK", "B00121QGPY", "B0016Q2D66", "B002J1RZHE", "B008220DGE", "B000O76ZQC", "B0013XZ6X4", "B00080ZG10", "B00337KM2S", "B000286RP2", "B004SIP8ZM", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00005JMJG", "B00005Q4CS", "B00AEBB9CS", "B00G4Q3KOC", "B0036TGSJE", "B001TOD92C", "B000OY8NBK", "B004XVMCKS", "B00GMV8M2Y", "B00005JLRE", "B00005JH9M", "B00004WG2F", "B00AEBB8SS", "B00005JKJA", "B00H9HZITU", "B000YENUI6", "B0041KKYDI", "B001MZ5W3M", "B000N3SU92", "B000EQHXNW", "B0041KKYEM", "B001LLH8SE", "B0007TKOAA", "B000P0J0BK", "B002S5N052", "B004SIP7S0", "B00AEBB8NI", "B002SJIO4A", "B000CQLZ0Q", "B000E33VWW", "B000M341QE", "B002VWNICC", "B001NFNFNU", "6305313687", "B00005JKTF", "B00FZ4KR4U", "B00008K7AO", "B00DL48BM6", "079073639X", "B00H83EUQW", "B000FVQLRA", "B0002TT0MI", "B00AHTYI5M", "B00H9L26AA", "B00003CWRX", "B002FHGESI"], "bought_together": ["B00005N8A9", "B0041KKYF6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000A3XY5A", "B0001CNRRU", "B0041KKYF6", "B00G4Q3KOC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 100262}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.22, "brand": "Paramount Home Video", "asin": "B000MCH5P4", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51poif023LL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Babel"}
