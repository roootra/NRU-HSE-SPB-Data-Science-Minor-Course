{"description": "Lone Japanese soldier Toshiro Mifune diligently scans the ocean from his island lookout as he must have thousands of times before, but this time he spies an abandoned life raft resting on a rocky bluff. Within minutes he's face to face with American sea-wreck survivor Lee Marvin and the two begin an elaborate game of cat and mouse. Director John Boorman presents this two-man war as a deadly game between a pair of overgrown children, who finally tire of it (as kids will) and settle into tolerated co-existence and then even something resembling a friendship. With impressionistic strokes, Boorman paints a lush tropical paradise in colors you can drink from the screen, capturing the texture of their experience as refracted through the cinema: the look of the island as seen through the haze of smoke, the sound of a sudden rainstorm as it hushes the island in a calming roar, the timelessness of life outside of civilization. The story seems almost secondary, an allegorical drama that comes alive in the excellent performances by Marvin and Mifune (who soon enough converse despite their complete inability to understand each other's language) and the visceral immediacy of Boorman's gorgeous widescreen images.Hell in the Pacificis not a tale told as much as a film experienced.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0007U84D8", "6300247376", "079284517X"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 615949}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.4, "brand": "", "asin": "076400459X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5112B61QYML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Hell in the Pacific/Collector's Edition [VHS]"}
{"description": "You know that old dramatic principle of suspension of disbelief? You'll have to rely on it for this box-office smash, but you won't be disappointed. Harrison Ford plays a U.S. president who single-handedly employs his rigid antiterrorism policy when a band of Russian thugs hatch a mid-flight takeover of Air Force One. Gary Oldman, who chews the scenery as the lead terrorist, will shoot a hostage at the slightest provocation. Glenn Close plays the sternly pragmatic vice president who negotiates with Oldman from her Washington seat of power. If you can believe that the aircraft's pressurized cabin can sustain hundreds of rounds of machine-gun fire, you'll buy anything in this entertaining potboiler, especially thanks to Ford's stalwart heroics and some nifty special effects. Director Wolfgang Petersen (Das Boot) keeps the action moving so fast you won't be sweating the details.

{"description": "There's no getting around a simple, basic truth: watchingLawrence of Arabiain any home-video format represents a compromise. There's no better way to appreciate this epic biographical adventure than to see it projected in 70 millimeter onto a huge theater screen. That caveat aside, David Lean's masterful \"desert classic\" is still enjoyable on the small screen, especially if viewed in widescreen format. (If your only option is to view a \"pan & scan\" version, it's best not to bother; this is a film for which the widescreen format is utterly mandatory.) Peter O'Toole gives a star-making performance as T.E. Lawrence, the eccentric British officer who united the desert tribes of Arabia against the Turks during World War I. Lean orchestrates sweeping battle sequences and breathtaking action, but the film is really about the adventures and trials that transform Lawrence into a legendary man of the desert. Lean traces this transformation on a vast canvas of awesome physicality; no other movie has captured the expanse of the desert with such scope and grandeur. Equally important is the psychology of Lawrence, who remains an enigma even as we grasp his identification with the desert. Perhaps the greatest triumph of this landmark film is that Lean has conveyed the romance, danger, and allure of the desert with such physical and emotional power. It's a film about a man who leads one life but is irresistibly drawn to another, where his greatness and mystery are allowed to flourish in equal measure.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000040EJ", "6305123616", "0800132009", "6304151306", "6304071876", "6303168507", "0792839846", "630150528X", "6304196954", "630018224X", "B0000048ZL", "B000005PFL", "6300215539", "0792844645", "6302464889", "0780616456", "6300216721", "6300246965", "0783235593", "0792837630", "6301628454", "6302909023", "B000059HGY", "6302415853", "6301976622", "6305282927", "0790743213", "6303020089", "6300214060", "0783216084", "6305261296", "B00003CXE6", "6301662954", "B000003KHS", "0800179552", "B000056BRF", "079213690X", "630105573X", "B00000F6D1", "6300215814", "6300185095", "B00005Q4GY", "0792133153", "6301971809", "6301628667", "6303494390", "B00004TIUO", "6300214567", "6300214826", "6300181340", "6303402348", "B000EO7AIC", "B00005A1VH", "0783235607", "0790732017", "6303057225", "0800199421", "0790733927", "6304935811", "6301016289", "6303383300", "0790752395", "6302610702", "0783221347", "0790701251", "0783231482", "630018627X", "0790734079", "B000003KDG", "B00005OCPO", "0792836553", "B000062XM6", "0800125762", "0792108280", "6302800420", "B00005QATY", "6300181286", "5559477621", "6301208773", "6301888901", "B00005A7VC", "B00005LMA7", "1558807780", "B00007JME0", "B00000I1EM", "6304111398", "6300183513", "6303402070", "0792116887", "6303203337", "0790744589", "6300251012", "6302256615", "0792110463", "6300183084", "B000006GCU", "B00004RFFA", "630347327X", "6302023742", "079283853X"], "bought_together": ["B0000040EJ", "6305123616"], "also_viewed": ["6305123616", "B000054OW2", "6305363668", "B00BBND56G", "0782008348", "0792836510", "6304117752", "0783216084", "6303402070", "0792839846", "6302610702", "6304539258", "1558807780", "0792158261", "B0000040EJ", "6302909023"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 425814}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.89, "brand": "VHS", "asin": "0767812778", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51CAQY4V9AL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Lawrence of Arabia (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]"}
{"description": "Based on a story by Clive Barker and skillfully written and directed by Bernard Rose,Candymanrises above most horror films by eerily suggesting that some urban legends--in this case a particularly frightening one--have a spooky basis in reality. The legend of the Candyman is a potent one around the high-rise tenements of Chicago's Cabrini-Green housing complex, where the residents speak of a dark, ominous figure who appears when his victims say his name five times in front of a mirror, then mercilessly slashes them to death. Upon learning that the Candyman is rumored to live in one of the vacant tenements, a University of Illinois researcher (Virginia Madsen) investigates a recent murder at Cabrini-Green. She learns that the Candyman (played by Tony Todd) is both unreal and chillingly real--a supernatural force of evil empowered by those who believe in his legend. He is a killer made flesh by the belief of others, and the young researcher's investigation is a threat to his existence. What happens next? We wouldn't dare spoil the chills, but rest assured that writer-director Rose has tapped into a wellspring of urban angst and fear, andCandymanserves up its gruesome frights with a refreshing dose of intelligence.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005K3NZ", "6305622760", "B001B8XRT6", "B000MNOX8U", "B008874968", "B000A6T1ZY", "B004AC6PMG", "B001B1UO6W", "B00005NRN6", "B000GBEWRU", "B000V4UFZK", "B0000AOX0D", "B000I2J68M", "6305972001", "B001B1872A", "B0000AOX0E", "B00006FDCD", "B000FS9FE4", "B001DJLD1W", "B005CFBZQ6", "B000099T3M", "B000RIWAVW", "B005OT810I", "B000MV8ABS", "B000EHRVP6", "B00006IUFV", "B0000AOX0A", "B001NPD9LS", "B000IMUYJM", "B001DJLD0S", "1573628174", "B0052XU4BK", "B003UGLCIA", "B00079Z9WI", "B000PMLJMQ", "B00009PY4G", "B000A2X3U2", "B0053TWVDC", "B002HML6YI", "B00005YUNE", "B00006FDBT", "B000VKL6Z2", "B000MV8AC2", "B001AGNMFI", "B00AEFYV9W", "B00018D42W", "B0013D8LAE", "B0002IQLH6", "B002LMSWN2", "B00005UQ9W", "B000S0GYRU", "B004EI2NP4", "B00AEFYYH6", "B000WC3864", "B0000CEB6Y", "B000FWHW86", "B0053TWVIM", "B006ZL1P66", "B00AEFY2LO", "B000N4RAQU", "B000TSIJWY", "B008CYDD7I", "B000FA57UI", "B0056P6SOG", "B002JT69IW", "B00CERJI5U", "B002ZG971U", "B0001EFV7M", "B002OVO18A", "0767817664", "B00006AUIG", "B005CFBZVG", "B00005NKSC", "B0000D9PNG", "B00005RHGK", "0792839706", "B00005LC4Q", "B004P7CM9Q", "B00JF5GAIW", "B00AQJ8MLY", "B002I41KNC", "B00KDU8HQQ", "B00001QGUM", "B0024FADD8", "B00DTPRZ24", "B001JV5BIA", "B003PIUINI", "B002VWNIDG", "B0021L8UPS", "B004LWZW24", "B003PIUINS", "B000Q66Q2O", "B00005K3NR", "0783230451", "B0006SGYL0", "B00023P4SS", "B0002VYOVS", "B0087ZG7UW", "B005CFBYW6", "B00006FI0R"], "bought_together": ["B00005K3NZ", "6305622760"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001B8XRT6", "6305972001", "B00004TDTO", "B001B1UO6W"]}, "price": 17.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 183485}, "asin": "0767817656", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DGRV60NAL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Candyman"}

{"description": "Two years after 20th Century Fox released its melodramatic disaster filmTitanicin 1953, Walter Lord's meticulously researched bookA Night to Remembersurprised its publishers by becoming a phenomenal bestseller. Lord had an intuition that readers craved the reality of the Titanic disaster and not the romantically mythologized translations (like Fox's film, starring Barbara Stanwyck), which relied on fictional characters to &quot;enhance&quot; the world's worst maritime disaster. Lord's book proved that the truth was far more compelling than fiction, outlining the many &quot;if onlys&quot; (if only the iceberg had been spotted a few minutes earlier, etc.) that lent somber irony to the loss of 1,500 Titanic passengers. Three years after Lord's book appeared, it was brought to the screen with the kind of riveting authenticity that Lord had insisted upon in his own research. The 1958 British production ofA Night to Rememberremains a definitive dramatization of the disaster, adhering to the known facts of the time and achieving a documentary-like immediacy that matches (and in some ways surpasses) the James Cameron epic released 39 years later. The film erroneously perpetuates the once-common belief that the Titanic sunk in one piece (instead of breaking in half as its bow began to plunge), but many other misconceptions are accurately corrected, and the intelligent screenplay by thriller master Eric Ambler is a model of factual suspense. By making Titanic the star of the film, director Roy Baker emphasizes the excessive confidence of the booming industrial age and creates an intense you-are-there realism that pays tribute to Walter Lord's tenacious quest for truth.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303396623", "B00008LDO9", "0792151712", "1558807780", "6301797906", "0792839846", "6300269728", "6301798732", "B00000DM1K", "6301564456"], "bought_together": ["6303396623", "0792151712"], "also_viewed": ["B00008LDO9"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 196802}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.88, "brand": "", "asin": "0769403468", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DV4DN95SL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "A Night to Remember: The Sinking of the Titanic [VHS]"}

{"description": "Maverick film director Samuel Fuller was doing some of his best work in the late 1950s and early 1960s, and in the years since its release in 1963,Shock Corridorhas become a B-movie classic and a prime example of Fuller's gritty tabloid style. Never hesitant to explore the darkened corners of contemporary life, Fuller depicts the chambers of an insane asylum as a microcosm of American society, telling the story of a cynical, ambitious journalist (Peter Breck) whose obsessive quest for a Pulitzer Prize leads him into the depths of madness. To investigate a murder, the reporter goes undercover in a mental hospital, having convinced a psychiatrist that he needs treatment. Once inside the asylum, he pieces together clues to the murder, but his own mind begins to deteriorate until he's trapped in a downward spiral towards insanity. Fuller heightens the melodrama with his aggressive style of filmmaking (his next film,The Naked Kiss, proved even more effective), and his imaginative use of black-and-white cinematography (by noted cameraman Stanley Cortez) fills the movie with raw, emotional power. It's the kind of film one would expect from a rebellious director on the Hollywood fringe, and that's whyShock Corridorremains an enduring low-budget examination of the \"rat race\" and the consequences of pursuing success at any cost. The Criterion Collection DVD presents the film in its original 1.85:1 aspect ratio, and a rarely seen color dream sequence has been fully restored.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0047P5FTA", "B00012L786", "B00005AUK9", "B0024FAG6W", "B00005AUKD", "B00AQ6J5YA", "B000QXDFS0", "B001GCATWA", "B00005JKGX", "B00ICWO1LC", "B0007PALOI", "B00005V6N6", "B0002V7O0Q", "B00DZP1BUU", "B0001US78Q", "B000AQKUH2", "B001LMU1C8", "B0007GAG42", "B00DZP1C9K", "1559409002", "B004C2523M", "B005152C9G", "B0006Z2NE0", "B00005QAPH", "B0024FAG80", "B000025RE7", "B0007989Y8", "B004ALIG4M", "B00I116MVQ", "B00065GX64", "B000BB14IA", "B00005BHW6", "0780022076", "B00CUKTHES", "B0007TKNLA", "B000MTEFOQ", "B001LMU19G", "B000093NQZ", "B00H8J2NTC", "B00007L4I6", "B001BEK8C4", "B004NWPY3E", "0780023099", "B000B8384Q", "B007N5YJMA", "B003ZYU3U0", "B003ICZW7I", "B000M2E3GI", "B001CW7ZT4", "B00005BH23", "B00EL6A7XE", "B005152C7S", "B00180R072", "B0007MANYY", "B00005A8TX", "0780022270", "B00000C0QO", "B00AQ6J6H6", "B00004TJKI", "B006TTC5MM", "B000244EYW", "B000B83846", "0780022823", "B00E18QKJ2", "B004WPYO7E", "B0002JP2OS", "B00IKM5OCO", "B009RWRINE", "B00007ELDG", "B001D8W7F4", "B0009X7682", "B00005N7Z1", "0783228457", "B000067IY4", "0780021134", "B001WLMOL4", "B00000F3CD", "B001BSBBIK", "B008Y5OVZ8", "B0024FAG8A", "B007N5YK10", "078002205X", "B006ML50SS", "B00006673L", "B00000IOKV", "6305999872", "B00AQ6J64O", "B00393SG42", "B00DZP1BVO", "B00AQ6J56S", "B0009X75EC", "B000AQKUG8", "B00005QAPJ", "B0012KSUUE", "0780022041", "B00004YZFR", "B005HK13S6", "B000B8380A", "B00005JLV7", "B004NWPY7A"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0024FAG6W", "B003WKL6XA", "0780022041", "078002205X"]}, "price": 24.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 248126}, "asin": "0780021096", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51NZARPYHEL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Shock Corridor (The Criterion Collection)"}

Thewlis plays the wayward scholar who is rescued at sea by Kilmer and brought to Moreau's island to discover the doctor's unnatural &quot;children.&quot; Fairuza Balk plays Moreau's half-cat daughter, but it's Brando and Kilmer (in one scene doing a killer Brando impersonation) who steal the show, along with the astounding makeup effects created by Stan Winston.

{"description": "The second installment of John Ford's famous cavalry trilogy (which also includesFort ApacheandRio Grande), this meditative Western continues the director's fascination with history's obliteration of the past. It features one of John Wayne's more sensitive performances as Capt. Nathan Brittles, a stern yet sentimental war horse who has difficulty preparing for his impending military retirement. All things considered, he refuses to leave before fulfilling his obligation to the local Indian tribe. It's a film about honor and duty as well as loneliness and mortality. And Oscar-winner Winton C. Hoch beautifully photographs it in Remington-like Technicolor tones (you've never seen such stunning cloud-covered skies). The combination of melancholy and farce (Victor McLaglen makes a perfect court jester) evokes comparisons to Shakespeare. Best of all, the scene in which Wayne fights back tears when receiving a gold watch from his troops is unforgettably bittersweet.

{"description": "Once upon a time, in the 1980s and early 1990s, American independent movies did not seek to merely ape Hollywood formulas. They were more than just feature-length resumes for shrewd, enterprising filmmakers who had nothing to say, but dreamed of saying it with a big-studio budget. Back then, independent films provided a different kind of movie experience; they challenged and provoked audiences--and none more so than 1991'sThe Rapture, written and directed by Michael Tolkin, the man who wrote the screenplay forThe Player, Robert Altman's scathing anti-Hollywood comedy. Mimi Rogers plays Sharon, a lost soul who gives up her hedonistic life of sex and drugs when she finds God and becomes a fundamentalist Christian fanatic. Her pilgrim's progress, presented in a deadpan, nonjudgmental style, culminates quite literally in the title event--the Second Coming, the Apocalypse, the end of the world, or whatever you want to call it. Rogers's fearless performance becomes all the more provocative when you recall that the actress is a lifelong member of the Church of Scientology.The Raptureis a mind-boggling, wildly ambitious movie that's open to myriad interpretations.

{"description": "Coasting on the successes ofGods and MonstersandGeorge of the Jungle, Brendan Fraser turns in yet another winning performance in this fish-out-of-water comedy in which Pleasantville meets modern-day Los Angeles, with predictably funny results. Fraser stars as Adam, who was born in the bomb shelter of his paranoid inventor dad (a less-manic-than-usual Christopher Walken), who spirited his pregnant wife (Sissy Spacek, in fine comic form) underground when he thought the Communists dropped the bomb (actually, it was a plane crash). Armed with enough supplies to last 35 years, the parents bring up Adam inLeave It to Beaverstyle with nary any exposure to the outside world. When the supplies run out, and dad suffers a heart attack, Fraser goes up to modern-day L.A. for some shopping and long-awaited culture shock. More of a cute premise with lots of clever ideas attached than a fully fleshed out story,Blast from the Pastis also supposed to be part romantic comedy, as the hunky Adam hooks up with his jaded Eve (Alicia Silverstone) and tries to convince her to marry him and go underground. The sparks don't fly, though, because Silverstone is saddled with the triple whammy of being miscast, playing an underwritten character, and suffering a very bad hairdo. Fraser, however, carries the film lightly and easily on his broad, goofy shoulders, mixing Adam's gee-whiz innocence with genuine emotion and curiosity; only Fraser could pull off Adam's first glimpse of a sunrise or the ocean with both humor and pathos. Also winning is Dave Foley as Silverstone's gay best friend, who manages to make the most innocuous statements sound like comic gems.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005RIJ3"], "bought_together": ["B00005RIJ3"], "also_viewed": ["B00G5G7EXY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 277212}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.95, "brand": "", "asin": "0780626478", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/513Y40DFZ6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Blast From the Past [VHS]"}

{"description": "A movie that only true horror buffs could love,Army of Darknessis officially part 3 in the wild and wacky Evil Dead trilogy masterminded by the perversely inventive director Sam Raimi, who would later serve as executive producer of the popular syndicated TV seriesHercules: The Legendary Journeys.Raimi's favorite actor, Bruce Campbell, returns as Ash (hero of the first two Evil Dead flicks), a hardware-store clerk who is magically transported--along with his beat-up Oldsmobile and a chainsaw attachment for his severed left forearm--to the brutal battlefields of the 14th century. He quickly assumes power (who else in the Middle Ages packs a shotgun and a chainsaw?), and unites his band of medieval knights against the dreaded Army of the Dead. Raimi gleefully subverts almost every horror-movie clich&eacute; as he serves up a nonstop parade of blood, gore, and vicious sword-bearing skeletons--an affectionate homage to animator Ray Harryhausen's classicJason and the Argonauts. The frantic action is fun while it lasts, but even at 80 minutesArmy of Darknessnearly wears out its welcome. You know that Raimi can maintain the mayhem for only so long before it grows tiresome, and fortunately this madcap movie quits while it's ahead.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B005J9ZFQG", "B000WC3864", "B008JFUNYG", "B001KEGR5M", "B0001LQJMQ", "B003S6S7TY", "B004GGU9K0", "B000QUCQX8", "B008CYDD7I", "B005J9ZE5I", "B00C6F61IW", "B004GGU9JQ", "B00004Y87O", "B000WC38FA", "B000AQ69QS", "B0006A9FKA", "B00IF8Q0YE", "B0013D8LAE", "B000RIWAVW", "B0002C9DK4", "B000F7CMPE", "B0001611DI", "B0000AOX0F", "B002LMSWN2", "B000FS9FE4", "B0002CHK1S", "157362408X", "B000IJ7A5Q", "B002GHHHG0", "B00D7AM6M0", "B000I2J68M", "B00009MGEM", "B001NPD9LS", "B00AQJ8MLY", "B000VKL6Z2", "B004SIP6LS", "B00007AJG4", "B002JT69IW", "0790729342", "B0009OUBC4", "B00005JA8B", "B001D5C1OO", "B000V4UFZK", "B00005LC4Q", "B0056P6SOG", "B004P7CMOQ", "B000UAE7O0", "B000WC389G", "B0016MJ6P6", "B000I0RNVQ", "B008WAM2E2", "B0001US7OA", "B00005N5RM", "B00AEFY2WI", "B000FJH5MC", "B000099T3M", "B004EI2NP4", "B00005JO16", "B008G33PIM", "B001DJLD1W", "B000TSIJWY", "B001DJLD0S", "B000AXWHSA", "B000FA57UI", "B00AEFXW8I", "B00018D42W", "B000068IEV", "B000S0GYRU", "B000FA57US", "6304712499", "B001B8XRT6", "B002VWNIDG", "B002OVO18A", "B0002ABURA", "B00006FDCD", "B00AEFYDM2", "B0028DRGDQ", "B008874968", "B0000AOX09", "B001KEGR5W", "B0000VCZNE", "0312291450", "B0087ZG7UW", "B0024FAG44", "B0053TWV46", "B0058I9DZM", "B003VMFWXO", "B003WTO5NO", "B0015U0QWG", "B004XVMCH6", "B004LWZW24", "B001B1UO6W", "B005HI4LMS", "B000LP6KNU", "B004SIP9Z6", "B00317LM8S", "B0031U8OEK", "B0024FADBA", "B000C20VRS"], "bought_together": ["B005J9ZFQG", "B000WC3864"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005J9ZFQG", "B00005R24K", "B008JFUNYG", "B009JBWOU0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 22777}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.74, "brand": "Universal Studios", "asin": "0783227434", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DQ0H428VL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Army of Darkness"}

{"description": "Set in Harlem and New Orleans in 1955, this supernatural thriller stirred a brief controversy when released in 1987 because some scenes featuring Lisa Bonet (then a popular cast member ofThe Cosby Show) were considered too sexually explicit to be rated R. The edited material was restored for the unrated video release, and the movie now makes a fitting double bill withFallen, with its similar plot about a sullen detective (Mickey Rourke) who is hired to find a missing person by a shady client with pointy fingernails named Louis Cyphre (Lucifer, get it?), played with subtle menace by Robert De Niro. Rourke's investigation leads him into an underworld of voodoo and forbidden desires, and as the mystery unfolds director Alan Parker fills every scene with conspicuous style and atmospheric excess, compelling critic Pauline Kael to observe that, &quot;Parker simply doesn't have the gift of making evil seductive, and he edits like a flasher.&quot; And yet, this movie does cast a spell of its own (Roger Ebert's review was considerably more charitable), and the performances of Rourke, De Niro, Bonet, and Charlotte Rampling are well suited to the ominous mood.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000AOX0E", "B003TRMLQM", "B0007VZ99E", "B002AS463W", "B00006JMPS", "B000059TFP", "B00005JKI5", "B0045HCJSU", "B002DYYGO2", "1453271139", "B00007EFIJ", "B000068IEX", "B00007BK2R", "B002CTJW0G", "B0009R1TI6", "B00004RE27", "B004LYWPZE", "B001U0HB5Q", "B00005V9HX", "0790750198", "B000HC2LHG", "B001TOD92C", "1573623857", "076782170X", "6305132917", "B00005JKJA", "0767830555", "B0006GAOJA", "B0000AOX0A", "B0001FGBW0", "6305238065", "6305308837", "B00008DDVY", "B000286RP2", "B003KV3E2C", "B0000DI87S", "6305262268", "B000E5N684", "B00005BCKG", "B000A2UBN4", "B0000542CH", "B000GGSMC6", "B0028OH568", "B0052ADPAU", "0859653862", "6305065551", "B000069HZO", "B000056PNL", "0783228457", "B000CR76U8", "B0045HCIYA", "B000TGJ80S", "0783225903", "B002VWNICC", "B0002KQNKE", "B00008CMRK", "B000NA1WEK", "B0019BI1DM", "6304936532", "B00008O38F", "B0002KPHZG", "B000ICL3NI", "B000P0J0AG", "B000QQFKYE", "B000063JDE", "B00008L3S6", "B001J710Y8", "079073219X", "B0041QSZM4", "B00E8G5HXM", "B00006RCNV", "6305177937", "B00827OWO8", "B000ZM1MGE", "B0024FADD8", "B00005V4XV", "B0056GLNLI", "B00096S48U", "B007XF0W3K", "B000059LGL", "B00007L4KF", "B00AEFXW8I", "0792833287", "B0045HCJTO", "B00013RC66", "B0006Z2LH4", "B00006L92U", "B0055CP9TU", "B00005LC4D", "B00005B6L0", "B00AEFXX9Q", "B00AEFXR8I", "B0013D8LKO", "B00003CXCF", "B000YENUI6", "B0002KPIQY", "B0016I0AJG", "B0043X1FNQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002AS463W", "B003TRMLQM", "B0041QSZTW", "6305065551"]}, "price": 12.08, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 295510}, "asin": "078401115X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51V7MKFPHCL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Angel Heart"}

{"description": "From the moment that Prince Eric's ship emerged from the fog in the opening credits it was apparent that Disney had somehow, suddenly recaptured that \"magic\" that had been dormant for thirty years. In the tale of a headstrong young mermaid who yearns to \"spend a day, warm on the sand,\" Ariel trades her voice to Ursula, the Sea Witch (classically voiced by Pat Carroll), for a pair of legs. Ariel can only succeed if she receives true love's kiss in a few day's time and she needs all the help she can from a singing crab named Sebastian, a loudmouth seagull, and a flounder. The lyrics and music by Howard Ashman and Alan Menken are top form: witty and relevant, and they advance the story (go on, hum a few bars of \"Under the Sea\").Mermaidput animation back on the studio's \"to do\" list and was responsible for usheringBeauty and the Beastto theaters.

{"description": "Do you know anyone who hasn't seen this movie? A box-office smash when released in 1993, this spectacular update of the popular 1960s TV series stars Harrison Ford as a surgeon wrongly accused of the murder of his wife. He escapes from a prison transport bus (in one of the most spectacular stunt-action sequences ever filmed) and embarks on a frantic quest for the true killer's identity, while a tenacious U.S. marshal (Tommy Lee Jones, in an Oscar-winning role) remains hot on his trail. Director Andrew Davis hit the big time with this expert display of polished style and escalating suspense, but it's the antagonistic chemistry between Jones and Ford that keeps this thriller cooking to the very end. In roles that seem custom-fit to their screen personas, the two stars maintain a sharply human focus to the grand-scale manhunt, and the intelligent screenplay never resorts to convenient escapes or narrative shortcuts. Equally effective as a thriller and a character study, this is a Hollywood blockbuster that truly deserves its ongoing popularity.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0790736411", "0767803434", "B00AEBB9UK", "B00008K76W", "B002NZK5R8", "B00AEFXT1S", "B000055Y0Y", "B00008K76V", "B004IK30MI", "B002NZK5UU", "B000CEV3M8", "B0045HCJ8K", "B00AEFXYJA", "B00008K76U", "0783225733", "B0045HCJFS", "B000O77SRC", "B000F8DV1M", "B00AEBB9NM", "B00AEFYXJ0", "B000EGDB10", "0800141601", "B002AT8K9W", "6305428115", "B0006GANOQ", "B00026ZG10", "6304711891", "B003ASLJIQ", "6304806434", "B000P0J0EW", "B00AEFY4CG", "B00AEFYF2K", "B000NTMA0Q", "0783240295", "B002NZK5VO", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00015YVDG", "B00AEBB8YW", "0790732238", "B002GIBVVG", "B00004STDN", "B002AT8KAG", "B00AEFXBG6", "B00AEFXVOI", "B000SFOW8I", "B002VWNICC", "B000U1ZV8K", "B002GHHHP6", "B00009WVSL", "B00008G8M4", "B002AS464Q", "B000PHVZNE", "B003AWRMBA", "0790732149", "B0007IO6NM", "B001ECDVJU", "B00AEBBA2W", "0783226888", "B000QUCRB4", "6305213283", "6304765258", "6304765266", "6305133468", "B00005B6JZ", "B002O3Z50G", "B00000G3PA", "B0043X1FNQ", "B000FO0AA6", "B00003CXGV", "B004AOECXI", "B00096S49Y", "B0014C2FX8", "6305236569", "B003ASLJMW", "B0014Z4OMU", "B000P0J0EM", "0790730979", "B0006N2EZ0", "0783222149", "B001LXIDW2", "0783226942", "B00001ZWUS", "B00AEFY5B6", "B00AEFXX9Q", "B00158K0QU", "B003QO8TOQ", "B00AEFXEGS", "0780618548", "0783235070", "B00004XPPG", "B0045HCJGC", "B000FO0A9W", "B0000AOV4I", "B000YCPUWW", "B00177YA1K", "630471193X", "B007SPPANM", "0792844874", "B00081U7HC"], "bought_together": ["0790736411", "0767803434"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000JYW5BE", "B004LWZW4M", "B000UBMSB8", "B0054OGQM8"]}, "price": 17.75, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 201394}, "asin": "079072961X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514VJP0EEHL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Fugitive"}

{"description": "EDITOR'S NOTE: According to a Warner Home Video technician involved in  the production ofThe Stanley Kubrick Collection, Kubrick authorized all aspects of theCollection, from the use of Digital Component Video (or \"D-1\") masters originally approved in 1989, to the use of minimalist screen menus, chapter stops, and (in the case of2001: A Space OdysseyandThe Shiningon DVD) supplementary materials. Full-screen presentation ofThe ShiningandFull Metal Jacketwas also approved by Kubrick, who recomposed his original framing,  reportedly believing that those films looked best on video in the full-screen format. (In fact, the original theatrical aspect ratio ofThe Shiningwas 1.66:1, meaning that a relatively small portion of the image is lost.) Kubrick also chose mono over stereo,  believing that inconsistencies in theatrical sound systems resulted in loss of control over theatrical presentation. In every respect, the Warner spokesman  said, the films in theCollectionremain as Kubrick approved them. Any future attempt to remaster or alter them would  have to be approved by an appointee of the Kubrick estate.", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301115430", "6300214826", "630018627X", "6304935811", "6301979761", "B00006C7G9", "B00000J2L7", "0784011923", "0790748169", "630407185X", "0800132009", "6302816580", "6301208773", "B00000JGEI", "B000BT8VVK", "B00000IO4G", "630018224X", "0792133153", "6300248135", "6302054982", "630300394X", "B00000K3AN", "6303696813", "6303020089", "6302415853", "6304826133", "6303029027", "0783235607", "6304259131", "B000065JH1", "0800179552", "6301217977", "B00007CVYA", "0800116917", "B0000CDL3W", "6304214502", "6302935148", "6304414099", "6303168507", "076783819X", "6300248089", "0800125762", "630018403X", "6300213005", "6303269834", "6303109950", "6300246965", "B00006IUOZ", "6300183211", "6304925131", "0783202253", "0783107986", "079213690X", "B000005XXG", "B00000FZCU", "0800187873", "6300214540"], "bought_together": ["6301115430", "6300214826"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 348239}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.99, "brand": "", "asin": "0790701251", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ZM1C6TC7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Full Metal Jacket [VHS]"}

{"description": "One of the key movies of the 1970s, when exciting, groundbreaking, personal films were still being made in Hollywood, Milos Forman'sOne Flew over the Cuckoo's Nestemphasized the humanistic story at the heart of Ken Kesey's more hallucinogenic novel. Jack Nicholson was born to play the part of Randle Patrick McMurphy, the rebellious inmate of a psychiatric hospital who fights back against the authorities' cold attitudes of institutional superiority, as personified by Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher). It's the classic antiestablishment tale of one man asserting his individuality in the face of a repressive, conformist system--and it works on every level. Forman populates his film with memorably eccentric faces, and gets such freshly detailed and spontaneous work from his ensemble that the picture sometimes feels like a documentary. Unlike a lot of films pitched at the &quot;youth culture&quot; of the 1970s,One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nestreally hasn't dated a bit, because the qualities of human nature that Forman captures--playfulness, courage, inspiration, pride, stubbornness--are universal and timeless. The film swept the Academy Awards for 1976, winning in all the major categories (picture, director, actor, actress, screenplay) for the first time since Frank Capra'sIt Happened One Nightin 1931.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002VWNIDG", "B000RTB0R6", "B006TTC5HC", "B000FVQLQQ", "B000P0J0EW", "0767830555", "B0043X1FL8", "B00003CWQR", "B004SIP7ZS", "B003ELKNH2", "B0006GAOJA", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00AEFXN9G", "0767811100", "0792833287", "B004SIP95G", "B0000YEEGM", "B00079Z9VO", "0451163966", "B00AEFYSWM", "B000P0J09M", "B008MIMWP8", "B000EHQU0S", "B006FE83UE", "B000M341QE", "B00AEFXESQ", "B00002VWE0", "B004SIP8ZM", "B002VWNIAY", "B00009W5CA", "0764586629", "B000ZM1MGE", "B00011CZRE", "B000P0J09C", "B0008ENHUI", "B00005V9HH", "B0019L770A", "B0019L21GA", "B00AEBB9CS", "B0050FXDDQ", "B000CNESTE", "B0006GANN2", "B000LP6KNU", "B000P0J0EM", "B00000IQV7", "B000055Y0X", "B00001ZWUS", "079073219X", "B0019UGYK0", "079284646X", "B00AEBB9F0", "B003ASLJO0", "B000A7DVR2", "B00AEBB9FA", "B0002B15ZG", "B004U7MR3M", "B000YAF4MA", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00066FBQG", "B00005JKIS", "6305144168", "B004SIP7TE", "B002ZG980U", "B00005ATQB", "B0045HCJ94", "0783229526", "B000A3XY5A", "B000093FLA", "B00026ZD04", "B004L9GMBC", "B0000DI87S", "B00006RCO1", "B0007PALZ2", "B0000JBALO", "B004IFYMYI", "B007N31YH0", "B000P0J0D8", "B000H4JH7Q", "B00B0U2SFE", "0792846443", "B007D0FVRM", "B000022TSY", "B0087ZG7UW", "B0002234LS", "B0045HCJ9E", "B0000A02TZ", "B001GD6VTE", "B00AEFYRP0", "0784011710", "B00009AOAZ", "B00005JLSB", "B000Q678OO", "0792838408", "6305882592", "B003LMPKSQ", "B00005MEOU", "B00AEFYSL8", "B0057ZAA6W", "B001AEF6BI", "B000HC2LHG"], "bought_together": ["B002VWNIDG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000P0J0EW", "0451163966", "B006TTC5HC", "B00AEFY0F2"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 40218}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.24, "brand": "WARNER STUDIOS", "asin": "0790732181", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51pJoIlXFbL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"}

{"description": "Winner of four Academy Awards, including best picture, director, supporting actor, and best editing, Clint Eastwood's 1992 masterpiece stands as one of the greatest and most thematically compelling Westerns ever made. &quot;The movie summarized everything I feel about the Western,&quot; said Eastwood at the time of the film's release. &quot;The moral is the concern with gunplay.&quot; To illustrate that theme, Eastwood stars as a retired, once-ruthless killer-turned-gentle-widower and hog farmer. He accepts one last bounty-hunter mission--to find the men who brutalized a prostitute--to help support his two motherless children. Joined by his former partner (Morgan Freeman) and a cocky greenhorn (Jaimz Woolvett), he takes on a corrupt sheriff (Oscar winner Gene Hackman) in a showdown that makes the viewer feel the full impact of violence and its corruption of the soul. Dedicated to Eastwood's mentors Sergio Leone and Don Siegel and featuring a colorful role for Richard Harris, it's arguably Eastwood's crowning directorial achievement.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B003ASLJS6", "B003ASLJRC", "6304698801", "B000N3SSBW", "B0000TANUI", "6304711905", "0783225725", "B000E5N6LG", "B00388PK7O", "0767817710", "B001LMAK88", "B00000K0DM", "B003ASLJO0", "B000XR9L50", "0792839056", "B002M9WW3A", "B003ASLJOU", "B0015XHQT4", "B003ASLJNQ", "B000055Y0Y", "B003AWRMBU", "B003ASLJIQ", "B000O599ZS", "6304698798", "B000GFRI4K", "B00AEBBA0E", "B003UESJME", "B0018PH3L0", "B00AEBB932", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00008IHAW", "B0045HCJTO", "B00HETDQKG", "0783228007", "B004FPXMDI", "B007Y1NR1W", "B000P0J0EW", "B00AEFXVOI", "B000059TFW", "B003ASLJQI", "B00AEFYSEA", "B003ASLJKE", "B004AOECXI", "B003AWRMBA", "B00005LOL0", "B001LRJH0U", "B00001ZWUS", "B000W1SZBS", "B001M9ELQ2", "B000056H2J", "B003AWRM9M", "B00AEFYL6K", "B003AWRMC4", "B0006GANN2", "B000O599WQ", "B000NQRR34", "B0045HCJSK", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B00AEBB8YM", "B00008CMT4", "B003ASLJQS", "B0008ENHUS", "B00008CMR4", "B00AEBB9NM", "B000O599Y4", "0792842502", "6304696612", "B003NF97MQ", "B0010DR4BO", "B0007MAO0C", "B0006GAOJA", "0792838408", "B003AWRM9W", "B00009W5CA", "B00066FBQG", "B000O599YE", "0767830555", "078322592X", "B000BDH6DU", "B000BITVBA", "B003ASLJJU", "B001KRVLCI", "B0000A2ZU1", "B000P0J09M", "B00008PX7J", "B00005LC4R", "B00B0U2SFE", "B002VWNIBI", "B0010YVCI4", "B004SIP7ZS", "B002O3Z4XE", "B00132D7Y0", "079284646X", "B003XURDAY", "B003ASLJK4", "B0001FVDJQ", "B00004XPPC", "B00AEBB9CS", "B0007MANYY", "6304698747"], "bought_together": ["B003ASLJS6", "B003ASLJRC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003ASLJRC", "B003ASLJS6", "0792842502", "B004AOECXI"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 104810}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.95, "brand": "WARNER STUDIOS", "asin": "0790729644", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DRkkBZz0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Unforgiven (Snap Case)"}
{"description": "Readers of John Berendt's bestselling novel were bound to be at least somewhat disappointed by this big-screen adaptation, but despite mixed reaction from critics and audiences, there's still plenty to admire about director Clint Eastwood's take on the material. Readers will surely miss the rich atmosphere and societal detail that Berendt brought to his &quot;Savannah story,&quot; and the movie can only scratch the surface of Georgian history, tradition, and wealthy decadence underlying Berendt's fact-based murder mystery. Still, Eastwood maintains an assured focus on the wonderful eccentrics of Savannah, most notably a gay Savannah antiques dealer (superbly played by Kevin Spacey), who may or may not have killed his friend and alleged lover (Jude Law). John Cusack plays theTown & Countryjournalist who arrives in Savannah to find much more than he bargained for--including the city's legendary drag queen Lady Chablis (playing &quot;herself&quot;)--and John Lee Hancock's smoothly adapted screenplay succeeds in bringing Berendt's characters vividly to life with plenty of flavorful dialogue.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_viewed": ["0679751521", "B003ZHR6RK", "B00BXUASTE", "B00H7LJ2UO", "B00GMV8LIO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 130929}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.95, "brand": "", "asin": "0790734680", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51J385SC76L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Midnight in the Garden of Good &amp; Evil [VHS]"}
{"description": "After the critical success of 1993'sThe Secret Garden, Warner Bros. returned to the novels of Frances Hodgson Burnett to create this 1995 adaptation ofA Little Princess, which instantly ranked withThe Secret Gardenas one of the finest children's films of the 1990s. Neither film was a huge box-office success, but their quality speaks for itself, andA Little Princesshas all the ingredients of a timeless classic. A marvel of production design, the film features lavish sets built almost entirely on a studio backlot in Burbank, California. The story opens in New York just before the outbreak of World War I, when young Sara (Liesel Matthews) is enrolled in private boarding school while her father goes off to war. Under the domineering scrutiny of the school's wicked headmistress, Miss Minchen (Eleanor Bron), Sara quickly becomes popular with her schoolmates, but fate intervenes and she soon faces a stern reversal of fortune, resorting to wild flights of fancy to cope with an unexpectedly harsh reality. Rather than label her fanciful tales as escapist fantasy,A Little Princessactively encourages a child's power of imagination--a power that can be used to learn, grow, and adapt to a world that is often cruel and difficult. It's also one of the most visually beautiful films of the '90s and creates a fully detailed world within the boarding school--a place where imagination is vital to survival. A first-class production in every respect, this is one family film that should (if it's not too stuffy to say it) be considered required viewing for parents and kids alike.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00003CXI0", "6302914469", "0790720434", "6303998046", "B00005LL26"], "also_viewed": ["B000E0WJOG", "0788812408", "0790720434", "6305282927", "0790719029", "6303392350", "B00005RERY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 355747}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.96, "brand": "", "asin": "0790725657", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Q92C7747L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "A Little Princess [VHS]"}

{"description": "Legendary silent film director Cecil B. DeMille didn't much alter the way he made movies after sound came in, and this 1956 biblical drama is proof of that. While graced with such 1950s niceties as VistaVision and Technicolor,The Ten Commandments(DeMille had already filmed an earlier version in 1923) has an anachronistic, impassioned style that finds lead actors Charlton Heston and Yul Brynner expressively posing while hundreds of extras writhe either in the presence of God's power or from orgiastic heat. DeMille, as always, plays both sides of the fence as far as sin goes, surrounding Heston's Moses with worshipful music and heavenly special effects while also making the sexy action around the cult of the Golden Calf look like fun. You have to seeThe Ten Commandmentsto understand its peculiar resonance as an old-new movie, complete with several still-impressive effects such as the parting of the Red Sea.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0002BO05S", "B0074JOUHE", "B0000633QW", "B001NSLE5I", "B00ALTQRUC", "B0006J28K0", "B00014K5V4", "B0007VY404", "B00D6I7DEE", "B00AMR5LZA", "B0006J28KA", "B003A6X166", "B0009WFF8Q", "B000CNE0JW", "B00005JN8Z", "B000056AXZ", "B0007VY3ZU", "B002Z2X7GU", "B00BQ7GU1Y", "B00005V1WY", "B001HFLU8I", "B00AMSM9CW", "B002T7X4UK", "B003A6WZXG", "B000056HP5", "B0009WFF9K", "B00009KYDL", "B000MGBM1I", "B00022LIHU", "B0074JOW5Y", "B000CNE0M4", "1450700551", "B002Z2X7GK", "B00005QJJG", "B002M2Z3BA", "B000RPCK2E", "B003NXH2TS", "B004RUF9DC", "B000BZISSU", "B0002UBX54", "B00028HBIO", "B00CNW9ZI6", "B00000JGOQ", "B006MWA96K", "B00BXHE208", "B0002J58JM", "B000JMKI10", "B0006GANX2", "B00125WAXM", "B002VWNIBI", "B000E1MXTG", "B00006ADD5", "B000CNESNA", "B00008LDO7", "B000WMFZMY", "B0001US8F8", "B001DZOCY6", "1450700543", "B00AEFY6DI", "B00HRYH6GI", "B000BVM1W8", "B0002UBX4U", "B000WS4S6C", "B000BDGVT0", "B002HK9IDQ", "B000BVM1VE", "B0001NBMDK", "B00KD5HFJG", "B00AEBB8VK", "B004L3ARS2", "B003I1DA6O", "B000N3T0GY", "B000HEWEJO", "1563713942", "B005CGI4O6", "1555681700", "B00006AG8D", "B001ECQ6E2", "B0090XLDKY", "B000EHSVS2", "B000BT970O", "B000URDCC6", "B0082SIPXQ", "B0047BXQZY", "B0001WTWS8"], "bought_together": ["B0074JOUHE", "B0002BO05S"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AMSM9CW", "B00AMR5LZA", "B000CNESNA", "B0002BO05S"]}, "price": 23.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 135826}, "asin": "0792154649", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51CW3ZCTDCL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Ten Commandments"}

{"description": "\"Something familiar, something peculiar, something for everyone: a comedy tonight!\" Those words from the opening song pretty much describe the menu inA Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum, a frantic adaptation of the stage musical by Larry Gelbart and Burt Shevelove. The wild story, set in ancient Rome, follows a slave named Pseudolus (Zero Mostel, snorting and gibbering) as he tries to extricate himself from an increasingly farcical situation; Mostel and a bevy of inspired clowns, including Phil Silvers, Jack Gilford, and Buster Keaton, keep the slapstick and the patter perking. The cast also includes the young Michael Crawford as a love-struck innocent. This project landed in the lap of Richard Lester, then one of the hottest directors in the world after his success with the Beatles' films. Lester telescoped the material through his own joke-a-second sensibility, and also ripped out some of the songs from Stephen Sondheim's Broadway score. The result is a pixilated romp and very close to the vaudeville spirit suggested by the title--though anyone with a low tolerance for Zero Mostel's overbearing buffoonery may be in trouble. Oddly enough, amidst all the frenzy, Lester creates a grungy, earthy Rome that seems closer to the real thing than countless respectable historical films on the subject.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B008SBXFUU", "B000BMY2LU", "B00001PE59", "B00003CWT3", "B000RPCK2E", "B0000068ZQ"], "bought_together": ["B008SBXFUU"], "also_viewed": ["B00402FGMG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 294428}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.74, "brand": "", "asin": "079283755X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51TGVS6F6HL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum [VHS]"}
{"description": "Jack Finney's classic science fiction novel has been the basis of three big-screen adaptations, beginning with the 1956 chillerInvasion of the Body Snatchersand most recently as 1994's underratedBody Snatchers. This acclaimed 1978 version from director Philip Kaufman (The Right Stuff) is every bit as creepy as the '56 original, and it fits perfectly into the cycle of paranoid thrillers that thrived in American movies of the 1970s. Kaufman stylishly directs from an intelligent screenplay by W.D. Richter, while Donald Sutherland and Brooke Adams lead a distinguished cast (including Jeff Goldblum, Leonard Nimoy, and Veronica Cartwright) and must fight for survival as the population of San Francisco is systematically cloned by alien &quot;pods&quot; from a distant, dying planet.

{"description": "This was the first James Bond adventure produced after the success ofStar Wars, so it jumped on the sci-fi bandwagon by combining the suave appeal of Agent 007 (once again played by Roger Moore) with enough high-tech hardware and special effects to make Luke Skywalker want to join Her Majesty's Secret Service. After the razzle-dazzle ofThe Spy Who Loved Me, this attempt to latch onto a trend proved to be a case of overkill, even though it brought back the steel-toothed villain Jaws (Richard Kiel) and scored a major hit at the box office. This time Bond is up against a criminal industrialist named Drax (Michel Lonsdale) who wants to control the world from his orbiting space station. In keeping with his well-groomed style, Bond thwarts this maniacal Neo-Hitler's scheme with the help of a beautiful, sleek-figured scientist (played by Lois Chiles with all the vitality of a department-store mannequin). There's a grand-scale climax involving space shuttles and ray guns, but despite the film's popular success, this is one Bond adventure that never quite gets off the launching pad. It's as if the caretakers of the James Bond franchise had forgotten that it's Bond--and not a barrage of gizmos and gadgets (including a land-worthy Venetian gondola)--that fuels the series' success. Despite Moore's passive performance (which Pauline Kael described as &quot;like an office manager who is turning into dead wood but hanging on to collect his pension&quot;),Moonrakerhad no problem attracting an appreciative audience, and there are even a few renegade Bond-philes who consider it one of their favorites.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000RPCK1K", "B000NIBUR6", "B000M53GLS", "B000RPCK24", "B000M53GN6", "B000RPCK1A", "B000RPCK0Q", "B000NDEXPM", "B000NIBUS0", "B001R10BN2", "B000M53GMW", "B000RPCK1U", "B000M53GNG", "B000NIBURQ", "B000M53GM2", "B000NDEXPC", "B00004RG62", "B001EDVNNU", "B000M53GMC", "B00004WEJZ", "B001PPLIEG", "B00AQSN7HE", "B007REV4T8", "B00005JL0I", "B009PN18R2", "B004BR7XLM", "B008YAPQX4", "B000067J15", "B00AZFECBS", "B00006BH8G", "B00AZFECJU", "B009RO9LKK", "B00AZFECL8", "B00000BLFI", "B009L6VWRO", "B000HT3PF6", "B009NUUBBQ", "B001AQT0WW", "B0000BYRO9", "B0001ENZLQ", "B009NUTPAO", "B009NUV0E8", "B0014C2FX8", "B009L6UDUG", "B00008K76U", "B005LAII44", "B00AZMFJYA", "B001U6YI9W", "B00AZFECS6", "B000O599YY", "B00AVWIQZS", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B007STBUHI", "B0045HCJ9O", "B004OB2EYQ", "B003Q6D2B4", "B00005PJ8S", "B004EPYZUS", "B008JFUO72", "1612185452", "B00005ATZT", "B00DZFKNFO", "B0000BYRO7", "B000BZISSU", "B00001U0BN", "B00AEFYENK", "B0014Z4ON4", "B001AQMBIC", "B0000UJL96", "B004L9GMBC", "B001PO6FF4", "B000FO0AA6", "B0000AUHOH", "B00009NHC0", "0792839064", "B000MGTQ7U", "B00005JLRQ", "B001AQO3WO", "0783226039", "B00AEBB8VK", "B00005JKU0", "B0013LL2Z2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000RPCK24", "B000M53GN6", "B001R10BN2", "B000NDEXPM"]}, "price": 11.94, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 283251}, "asin": "0792838033", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/513267YK57L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Moonraker THX Edition"}
{"description": "It's pretty tough to beatJailhouse Rockin terms of sheer entertainment, but Elvis lovers are particularly fond of this 1964 hit. The Big E plays race-car driver Lucky Jackson, who arrives in Las Vegas for an upcoming Grand Prix race. Lucky's car needs a new engine, so he gets a waiter job at a casino and starts working his crooning charms on Rusty Martin (Ann-Margret). It's their on-screen chemistry that makes this flick a lot of fun; Presley never had a better costar than Ann-Margret, and their race-car romance is quintessential 1960s fluff. Then there are the songs, of course, including the snappy title tune, a rockin' rendition of Ray Charles's &quot;What'd I Say?,&quot; and &quot;The Yellow Rose of Texas.&quot;Viva Las Vegasis one of the Elvis movies that stands the test of time, when the legend was still at his peak.

{"description": "Nora Ephron wrote the brisk screenplay for this 1989 romantic comedy, director Rob Reiner made a nicely glossy New York story (very much in a Woody Allen vein) out of it, and Billy Crystal's unstoppable charm made it something really special. Crystal and Meg Ryan play longtime platonic friends who keep dancing around their deeper feelings for one another, and Bruno Kirby and Carrie Fisher are their respective pals who fall in love and get married. Ryan doesn't get a lot of funny material, but her performance is typically alive and intuitive, and she more than holds her own with Crystal's comic motor mouth and sweet sentimentality. Reiner is on comfortable ground, liberated from the burden of making serious statements in the lead-footed manner of subsequent features.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302936381", "6301796535", "6301963911", "B000YDBPAM", "6305123616", "6300263673", "6301412761", "0792839846", "B001DZFYPW", "6303215734", "630339406X", "6300215695", "B00008FEBU", "6304457324", "0783215096", "6302842263", "0790732017"], "bought_together": ["6302936381", "6301796535"], "also_viewed": ["6302936381", "B00000F5PI", "6303402348", "B00158K0QU", "0792837894", "B00AEFXXMI"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 254468}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 0.99, "brand": "", "asin": "0792837207", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/519FHVZB5JL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "When Harry Met Sally...

{"description": "Based on Thomas Harris's novel, this terrifying film by Jonathan Demme really only contains a couple of genuinely shocking moments (one involving an autopsy, the other a prison break). The rest of the film is a splatter-free visual and psychological descent into the hell of madness, redeemed astonishingly by an unlikely connection between a monster and a haunted young woman. Anthony Hopkins is extraordinary as the cannibalistic psychiatrist Dr. Hannibal Lecter, virtually entombed in a subterranean prison for the criminally insane. At the behest of the FBI, agent-in-training Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) approaches Lecter, requesting his insights into the identity and methods of a serial killer named Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine). In exchange, Lecter demands the right to penetrate Starling's most painful memories, creating a bizarre but palpable intimacy that liberates them both under separate but equally horrific circumstances. Demme, a filmmaker with a uniquely populist vision (Melvin and Howard,Something Wild), also spent his early years making pulp for Roger Corman (Caged Heat), and he hasn't forgotten the significance of tone, atmosphere, and the unsettling nature of a crudely effective close-up. Much of the film, in fact, consists of actors staring straight into the camera (usually from Clarice's point of view), making every bridge between one set of eyes to another seem terribly dangerous.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005LKIM", "6302054982", "B00008AOS5", "B00005PJ8I", "B000007OY0", "6302800420", "0790705141", "B00003CXE6", "6301179552", "6301427076", "B000003KHS", "6300989003", "6303402348", "B0000633ZP", "B00005ATQA"], "bought_together": ["6302054982"], "also_viewed": ["6305363668", "6302415853", "0792116887", "079213690X", "0800103106", "6305750750"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 331980}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.0, "brand": "", "asin": "0792842111", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4117Q86BS0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Silence of the Lambs [VHS]"}

{"description": "Inspired more by Disney's20,000 Leagues Under the Seathan the Jules Verne novels it purports to be based upon (1896'sClipper of the Cloudsand 1904'sMaster of the World), this American International Pictures production is a mildly diverting period fantasy adventure, buoyed mainly by leads Vincent Price and Charles Bronson. Nineteenth-century government agent Strock (Bronson) hires Prudence (Henry Hull), a munitions maker and balloon enthusiast, to help investigate the source of a mysterious voice that emanated from Pennsylvania's Great Eyrie. With Prudence's daughter Dorothy (Mary Webster) and her fianc&eacute; Philip (David Frankham), the pair flies over the mountain, only to be shot down and taken captive by Robur (Price). Using his colossal airshipAlbatross, Robur plans to end world warfare by decimating any country that refuses to lay down its arms. Despite solid efforts by Price and Bronson (who reportedly disliked each other), a thoughtful script by fantasy author Richard Matheson, and a lively score by Les Baxter,Masternever takes flight. Miniature effects by Tim Baar, Wah Chang, and Gene Warren (a.k.a. Projects Unlimited, which created creatures for \"The Outer Limits\") are hobbled by AIP's infamously low budget, and B-movie vet William Whitney's direction is painfully lethargic. Lacking the necessary super-sized scope and star power of other Verne adaptations, including 1958'sAround the World in Eighty Daysand 1959'sJourney to the Center of the Earth,Masteris for AIP and Price completists only.

{"description": "Winner of five Academy Awards including Best Picture, Actor, and Screenplay,Kramer vs. Kramerremains as powerfully moving today as it was when released in 1979, simply because its drama will remain relevant for couples of any generation. Adapted by director Robert Benton from the novel by Avery Corman, this is perhaps the finest, most evenly balanced film ever made about the failure of marriage and the tumultuous shift of parental roles. It begins when Joanna Kramer (Meryl Streep) bluntly informs her husband Ted (Dustin Hoffman) that she's leaving him, just as his advertising career is advancing and demanding most of his waking hours. Self-involvement is just one of the film's underlying themes, along with the search for identity that prompts Joanna to leave Ted with their first-grade son (Justin Henry), who now finds himself living with a workaholic parent he barely knows. Juggling his domestic challenge with professional deadlines, Ted is further pressured when his wife files for custody of their son. This legal battle forms the dramatic spine of the film, but its power is derived from Benton's flawlessly observant script and the superlative performances of his entire cast. Because Benton refuses to assign blame and deals fairly with both sides of a devastating dilemma, the film arrives at equal levels of pain, growth, and integrity under emotionally stressful circumstances. That gives virtually every scene the unmistakable ring of truth--a quality of dramatic honestly that makesKramer vs. Kramernot merely a classic tearjerker, but one of the finest American dramas of its decade.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["630273973X", "0783240171", "B00005NQGQ", "B00AEBB95K", "6301627091", "6300182304", "0792835018", "B004IFIMT4", "6301247485", "6304935811"], "bought_together": ["630273973X"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 256640}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.95, "brand": "", "asin": "0800106032", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51J3PVCJM3L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Kramer vs. Kramer [VHS]"}

An Inconvenient Truth records a multi-media presentation hosted by Gore in which he discusses the scientific facts behind global warming, explains how it has already begun to affect our environment, talks about the disastrous consequences if the world's governments and citizens do not act, and shares what each individual can do to help protect the Earth for this and future generations.

{"description": "Perhaps only the collective brilliant minds of the Monty Python film and television troupe are up to the task of tackling a subject as weighty as the Meaning of Life.

Happily for us all,Monty Python's the Meaning of Lifetruly explains everything one conceivably needs to know about the perplexities of human existence, from the mysteries of Catholic doctrine to the miracle of reproduction to why one should avoid the salmon mousse to the critical importance of the machine that goesping!Using fish as a linking device (and what marvelous links those aquatic creatures make),The Meaning of Lifeis presented as a series of sketches: a musical production number about why seed is sacred; a look at dining in the afterlife; the quest for a missing fish (there they are again); a visit from Mr. Death; the cautionary tale of Mr. Creosote and his rather gluttonous appetite; an unflinching examination of the harsh realities of organ donation, and so on. Sadly, this was the last original Python film, but it's a beaut. You'll laugh. You'll cry (probably because you're laughing so hard). You may even learn something about the Meaning of Life.

Cusack and Driver are utterly charming--as is the leading man's sister, Joan, who plays his secretary. (Ms. Cusack received an Oscar nomination for her next role, inIn & Out.) Alan Arkin is also very funny as Martin's psychiatrist.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00003CXGA", "B00009OWJY", "B0015XHQVC", "B004SIP9RO", "B00005JKFA", "B002JOUNE8", "B004YCKKFK", "B000065U1Q", "B00005JPT0", "B000BNX3B4", "B00000IQBW", "B000001FJL", "B00005U5AG", "B00BNH9NCU", "B00008K77D", "B001HVZOB6", "B0013D8LBS", "B000P0I4O4", "B003ASLJQ8", "B000DZ7YN8", "B00AADAK5W", "B004SIP7ZS", "0780618548", "B00003CY5G", "B00014NEZI", "B00008DDXK", "B00AEFXE9U", "B000TJ6PBK", "B002ZG97XI", "B00007AJF8", "0767802519", "B00008EY9G", "6305428239", "6305236569", "B0009X7BDC", "B002FU8IWU", "B007P9HW3M", "B000GGSMC6", "B000065V3H", "B00GHJ1YUI", "B004ZNFTDQ", "B000ELL1SA", "6305428034", "B000093FLA", "B0045HCJFS", "B0015XHQUI", "6304698747", "6305428050", "0783229364", "B00006JDVV", "B000274T94", "B000065V3E", "B00008OE4W", "B000053VB4", "B00016MSV2", "B00005V9I0", "B00005JKBC", "B00AEFYUQQ", "B003ASLJPE", "B009YQJ322", "0767812182", "B0000B1OFL", "B004SIP8LG", "B00008975Z", "B00003CY41", "B0029XFN9Y", "B0049IHX2C", "B00005V4XW", "B00AEFXO8Q", "6305263248", "B00BTYJYOY", "B002AS466O", "0767821513", "6304806434", "B002NZK5R8", "B00AEBB9DW", "B002O3Z4VG", "B0000A02TZ", "B00BTYFWEA", "0792846435", "B004CQZFIU", "B00004XPPB", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B00026ZG10", "B00AG475K8", "B0000A9GHD", "B004WCTLNY", "B002ZG96ZC", "B00DW5IJR6", "B00009Y3PV", "B002WEEYIQ", "B0012KJ0DK", "B0000524E5", "0767817729", "076782153X", "B000PAAJZ6", "B0007IO6NM", "B00AEFXWXI", "B00AG473GE", "B0010YSD8Q"], "bought_together": ["B00003CXGA", "B00005JKFA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00003CXGA", "B000QUU4MI", "B002JOUNE8", "B00005JKFA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 8109}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.99, "brand": "Buena Vista", "asin": "1558908382", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51gX6Vb2znL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Grosse Pointe Blank"}
{"description": "Director Marty DiBergi (Rob Reiner) solemnly alerts us to the glory that was Spinal Tap in his introduction to this \"rockumentary\" about the legendary British heavy-metal group, featuring lead guitarist Nigel Tufnel (Christopher Guest), lead singer David St. Hubbins (Michael McKean), bassist Derek Smalls (Harry Shearer), and a succession of drummers whose careers were cut short by spontaneously combusting on their stool, drowning in somebody else's vomit, or otherwise perishing in untimely fashion. Under DiBergi's studious interrogation, the band and their familiars retrace the band's evolution from head-bopping Mersey Beat poseurs to head-banging metal poseurs, each change in musical direction or tonsorial chic having little effect on the surviving trio's sublime idiocy. For, as St. Hubbins (he's the \"deep\" one, relatively speaking) sagely observes, \"It's such a fine line between stupid and clever.\"Happily for us, director Reiner, who developed the underlying story line with Guest and former Credibility Gap pranksters McKean and Shearer, stays squarely on the right side of the line, even as his writer-actors remain hilariously trapped on the other side. In lieu of a formal shooting script, the quartet created an extensive and detailed band history ripe with the sort of dead-pan detail that hard-core rock historians and screwball aficionados will savor on countless replays; with the three Tap members also musicians themselves, the \"band\" developed its stage act under the unsuspecting noses of L.A. club denizens, who accepted them as just as loud, flashy, sexist, and obvious as any other mullet-tressed, leather-garbed brigade of guitar slingers, circa 1984. The resulting footage thus manages to lob its punch lines and build its characters (including some thinly veiled character assassinations of various industry folks) with a loose, tossed-away verve rooted in the improvisational approach.This Is Spinal Tapremains the funniest, and most truthful, look at rock culture ever filmed and a personal best for all involved.--Sam Sutherland", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 99031}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "title": "This Is Spinal Tap (The Criterion Collection)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000ALFVD", "B00005ALS0", "B00005LC5D", "B000M341Q4", "B00005O3VC", "B000A7DVR2", "B00006HAWL", "B000VE439Y", "B00AEFXDO6", "B0000A02TZ", "B002RVZV9K", "B003CRM6PA", "B00004WGVQ", "B0009298N4", "B000A2UBNE", "B0009UC810", "B000LP6KNU", "B00006LPGP", "B00029RTCG", "B000055Y0X", "B0006GANPA", "B00003CXZ4", "B000MMMT9G", "B002DLB1IO", "B00006D295", "B00AEFYVMO", "B00007AJF8", "B00000ILDD", "B00003CXC3", "B00005A06N", "B0009IOR5M", "B0001Z4OXS", "B0000640VJ", "B004ALIG4M", "B000PAAJZ6", "B00005O06J", "B004L9GMBC", "B002HMHSJ0", "1559408677", "B0010YSD8Q", "B00AEFYR3C", "0780618564", "0767833988", "B004P9UWM8", "B003ELKNH2", "B000ROALGW", "B000HT3QBO", "B00000F3CD", "B0008JIJ2O", "B00005K3NU", "B000Z8GZYW", "B0024EWP6W", "B00008J2HC", "0780020707", "B001ECDVKE", "B000XJD33O", "B000CNESU8", "B000RJO578", "B000EGEJIY", "B000ZM1MG4", "0780622561", "B00BQTLVWK", "B00004ZBVO", "B00005B6JZ", "B000G6BLWE", "B0013K1ALE", "B0007UC8Y4", "B003XURDAY", "B0006GAOJA", "B00278FSXM", "0767827724", "B001IHJ988", "0783229526", "B000OHZKJA", "B001WLMOL4", "B000AP04L0", "B0057ZAA6W", "B00003CXGA", "B003YDORO0", "B00004YZFR", "B003O7I6SE", "6305161879", "B00AEBB9DM", "0783241895", "B00009OWJY", "B00005V0XF", "B000A2UBN4", "B002WJHBEU", "6304907729", "0783230338", "B0019UGYK0", "B000H7JCFK", "B000E33W1W", "B000069HZU", "B00H3JHH6Q", "B00AEFXJS6", "B00005JNZU", "B000067IZ3", "B00AEFXE9U", "B0009ZE9VW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005ALS0", "B0000ALFVD", "B000M341Q4", "B0018CMJSU"]}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71HEEMJV31L._SY300_.gif", "asin": "1559408758"}
{"description": "An ultra-cheap B-horror movie, filmed in Lawrence, Kansas, in 1962, with a  really creepyTwilight Zone-style premise and some great shoestring atmosphere.  Wandering into a small town after an auto accident, to begin her new job as a church  organist, young Mary Henry (Candace Hilligoss) begins to pick up strange vibes: none of  the normal people in town seem to be able to see her, and she keeps being accosted by  freakish pasty-faced types who seem to be dead on their feet. The nightmarish finale  benefits from its one-of-a-kind \"found\" setting, an empty amusement park rising like a  ghostly castle from the prairie landscape.

{"description": "A medieval Benedictine monk with a penchant for solving mysteries using deductive reasoning, Brother Cadfael, as expertly portrayed by actor Derek Jacobi in a series of programs produced for British television, tackles a murder case that grows out of a search for the bones of a martyred saint. Traveling from the Abbey of Shrewsbury to Wales after a young monk claims to have had a vision of the martyred St. Winifred, Cadfael and his fellow monks locate the holy relics, which they hope to return to their own abbey. The locals, however, insist that their beloved saint's bones shall remain in Wales, and the monks find themselves being thwarted by a proud Welsh lord who is soon found murdered. The suspicious locals point fingers at the English monks and at a young man in love with the lord's daughter. Cadfael, with the help of a beautiful and plucky heroine (played by Anna Friel), finally figures it all out and justice is ultimately done. The plot has some intelligent and unexpected twists, and fine acting from the supporting cast provides a solid complement to Jacobi's understated performance as the detective monk. Also worth noting is the artfully rendered historical ambience that makes this film, like others featuring Brother Cadfael, worthwhile even for those who don't generally watch mysteries.--Robert J.

{"description": "Like seeds of a dandelion blowing in the wind, the plot ofTampopowanders in several directions, following the lives of a quirky collection of characters. At the heart of this film is a young widow named Tampopo (Nobuko Miyamoto), who is struggling to make ends meet by running a noodle restaurant. Goro (Tsutomu Yamazaki), a truck driver, saves Tampopo's young son from being beaten by a group of school girls and is rewarded with a bowl of very bad ramen (noodles). Goro tells Tampopo the awful truth about her cooking and she asks for his help. Together they search for the perfect ramen recipe.Intersecting this part of the plot are several smaller and less well-realized stories. Koji Yakusho, who stars inShall We Dance, appears as a sensuous gangster who would rather play with his food than eat it. Then there's the mysterious Noodle Master who lives with a group of street vagabonds and a young executive who knows how to order food from a French menu, but not how to preserve the dignity of his superiors.While the film as a whole feels somewhat disjointed, writer-director Juzo Itami manages to infuseTampopo(which means \"dandelion\") with a sense of Japanesejoie de vivrethat is worth experiencing.

{"description": "Die-hardBeavis and Butt-headfans will probably enjoy this incidental \"best of\" compilation, which contains seven segments pulled from MTV, aggregated into a 50-minute presentation. But creator Mike Judge's two nerdy, sexually piqued high school delinquents pale in the shadow of that other animated wonder,South Park. In fact, Beavis and Butt-head seem a little pass&#xE9; in light of the success of rival network Comedy Central and its wunderkind, junior high school-based series created by Trey Parker and Matt Stone ofBASEketballfame. Consequently, the segments rely on the same tired jokes again and again (\"heh-heh, heh-heh, he said 'come'\") and by the time Beavis chows down on too much sugar and his alter-ego, Cornholio, appears in episode six, we're struggling with the woeful repetition and limitations of the boys' routine. The best is saved for first on the disc because the segment entitled \"No Laughing\" is at least somewhat original in spirit. It may be that we haven't yet been dumbed down by the one-trick pony parade. As for the rest, well, things progress from okay to bad and even Cornholio, searching for \"T.P. for my bunghole\" can't bring things up to speed. This is definitely a disc for true Beavis and Butt-head believers only.

{"description": "In this 1949 dramatization of Henry James'sWashington Square, Olivia de Havilland is the plain but presentable spinster who lives with her domineering father (Ralph Richardson). What she lacks in looks she makes up for in wealth, and soon finds herself the object of much attention by Montgomery Clift. At the heart of this drama is the question of his possibly mercenary agenda. De Havilland does not seem to care one way or the other, but her father cannot believe any man would love her for any reason but her wealth.This version does not stray too far from the novel. It is a masterpiece that reveals both suppressed anger within a family and the suppression of women in the 19th century. De Havilland, all simmering desire and controlled rage, won an Oscar for best actress, and Aaron Copland copped one for best score. It is no surprise that this handsome picture was also awarded Oscars for costume design and art direction. It was remade and updated with an oddly feminist twist in 1997under the novel's original title.--Rochelle O'Gorman", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00074DY0W", "6301564456", "B00AEFYRJQ", "6301971558", "B001BSBBDK", "6301973410", "6302278929", "6301969049", "6301670140", "630266232X", "6304039506", "6301969316", "6302878543", "6302413435", "6302375827", "6302308208", "B000003KE0", "B003MG6FJY", "6301586042", "0783236352", "6300183890", "6301798503", "6302503493", "6301586050", "6301967569", "6304879482", "B0000048YO", "6303333079", "6303364772", "6300183580", "6301971167", "6301978536", "B000006BV8", "0792837967", "0800113055", "6304383169", "6300208133", "0790743531", "B00003OSTO", "630197350X", "0783217528", "6301975987", "6301973380", "6302787033", "6302226899", "6300215644", "6301978110", "6301797957", "6301773586", "6302732964", "6301640667", "6302990130", "6302801133", "0783235674", "1558807780", "0800100832", "6304029284", "6302842263", "B0002IXSVI", "6301800974", "6300183513", "B00004TX24", "6300207994", "079284517X", "0783217390", "6300987485", "6301969405", "6302208955", "0792839846", "6301278437", "0792836588", "6301972279"], "bought_together": ["6304879482"]}, "price": 13.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 188226}, "asin": "6300183912", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51FQF10GVVL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Heiress [VHS]"}

{"description": "The era of Molly Ringwald's profitable collaboration with writer-producer-director John Hughes (Sixteen Candles,The Breakfast Club) was at its peak with this 1986 film (directed by Howard Deutch but in every sense part of the developing Hughes empire). Ringwald plays a high school girl on the budget side of the tracks, living with her warm and loving father (Harry Dean Stanton) and usually accompanied by her insecure best friend (Jon Cryer). When a wealthy but well-meaning boy (Andrew McCarthy) asks her out, her perspective is overturned and Cryer's character is threatened. As was the case in the mid-'80s, Hughes (who wrote the script and produced the film) brought his special feel for the cross-currents of adolescent life to this story. In its very commercial way, it is an honest, entertaining piece about growing pains. The attractive supporting cast (many of whom are much better known now) does a terrific job, and Ringwald and Cryer have excellent chemistry.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["630018403X", "6300183467", "6300214753", "6300214370", "0767825411", "6300213668", "6302862787", "0784011923", "B0000048S1", "6304932553", "6302765536", "6302091632", "630442972X", "6300269639", "6300215814", "6302824729", "6301570723", "B00000490M", "B00000JGEI", "0783216084", "0790731436", "6305814694", "6303344224", "6300183181", "B00005B6ND", "0800109481", "6300263673", "0783220804", "6303236863", "B000059XVO", "B00023BLXA", "6303540082", "6301827732", "6302374189", "6301966988", "B0000BWVBD", "B00006G8LB", "B00008DZ83", "B000059XY5", "6303212379", "6304263457", "6300215695", "630362572X", "B000055YW4", "6301412761", "6303123244", "6304209266", "6304773366", "B000R3KOWE"], "bought_together": ["630018403X", "6300183467"], "also_viewed": ["B001AEF6BI", "6300183467", "0790742322", "6304718551", "6303212379", "6300214540", "6301412761", "6300182207", "0767825411", "6302814782", "B00004TWZK", "630339406X", "6300263673", "6300213005", "6300214370", "6304509154", "6300213986", "6300182916"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 255262}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.45, "brand": "", "asin": "6300214710", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516554BJ34L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Pretty in Pink [VHS]"}
{"description": "Jingoism, beefcake, military hardware, and a Giorgio Moroder rock score reign supreme over taste and logic in this Tony Scott film about a maverick trainee pilot (Tom Cruise) who can't follow the rules at a Navy aviation training facility. The dogfight sequences between American and Soviet jets at the end are absolutely mechanical, though audiences loved it at the time. The love story between Cruise's character and that of Kelly McGillis is like flipping through pages of advertising in a glossy magazine. This designer action movie from 1986 would be all the more appalling were it not for the canny casting of good actors in dumb parts.

{"description": "AlthoughStar Trek: The Motion Picturehad been a box-office hit, it was by no means a unanimous success withStar Trekfans, who responded much more favorably to the \"classicTrek\" scenario ofStar Trek II: The Wrath of Khan. Inspired by the \"Space Seed\" episode of the original TV series, the film reunites newly promoted Admiral Kirk with his nemesis from the earlier episode--the genetically superior Khan (Ricardo Montalban)--who is now seeking revenge upon Kirk for having been imprisoned on a desolated planet. Their battle ensues over control of the Genesis device, a top-secret Starfleet project enabling entire planets to be transformed into life-supporting worlds, pioneered by the mother (Bibi Besch) of Kirk's estranged and now-adult son. While Mr. Spock mentors the young Vulcan Lt. Saavik (then-newcomer Kirstie Alley), Kirk must battle Khan to the bitter end, through a climactic starship chase and an unexpected crisis that will cost the life of Kirk's closest friend.

Typical of Malle, the  outwardly forbidden nature of the story and relationships within are morally  obscured by the immediate experiences and unqualified urges of the  characters. The little heroine brings a distinctly youthful and innocent view  to the milieu, and the introduction of a photographer (Keith Carradine)--who  eventually marries Violet--in the brothel carries the suggestion that there is art and beauty to be explored there. Susan Sarandon is beguiling as  Violet's mother, who seems to unfold in the cameraman's presence.

{"description": "Black comedies don't come much blacker than this cult favorite from 1972, and they don't come much funnier, either. It seemed that director Hal Ashby was the perfect choice to mine a mother lode of eccentricity from the original script by Colin Higgins, about the unlikely romance between a death-obsessed 19-year-old named Harold (Bud Cort) and a life-loving 79-year-old widow named Maude (Ruth Gordon). They meet at a funeral, and Maude finds something oddly appealing about Harold, urging him to \"reach out\" and grab life by the lapels as opposed to dwelling morbidly on mortality. Harold grows fond of the old gal--she's a lot more fun than the girls his mother desperately matches him up with--and together they makeHarold & Maudeone of the sweetest and most unconventional love stories ever made. Much of the earlier humor arises from Harold's outrageous suicide fantasies, played out as a kind of twisted parlor game to mortify his mother, who's grown immune to her strange son's antics. Gradually, however, the film's clever humor shifts to a brighter outlook and finally arrives at a point where Harold is truly happy to be alive. Featuring soundtrack songs by Cat Stevens, this comedy certainly won't appeal to all tastes (it was a box-office flop when first released), but if you're on its quirky wavelength, it might just strike you as one of the funniest movies you've ever seen.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301590740", "B00000FZCU"], "bought_together": ["6301590740"], "also_viewed": ["6300247171"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 239875}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6300216268", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5184NCC63XL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Harold &amp; Maude [VHS]"}

As noted, the script, by Colin Higgins, owes a big debt to Alfred Hitchcock; but the mystery isn't all that mysterious and the comedy isn't all that hilarious--at least not until Richard Pryor shows up, which is at least halfway through the film. Things definitely pick up from there. Jill Clayburgh, as the love interest, is merely along for the train ride.

{"description": "When it comes down to naming the best Western of all time, the list usually narrows to three completely different pictures: John Ford'sThe Searchers, Howard Hawks'sRed River, and Hawks'sRio Bravo. About the only thing they all have in common is that they all star John Wayne. But whileThe Searchersis an epic quest for revenge andRed Riveris a sweeping cattle-drive drama (\"Take 'em to Missouri! Yeeee-hah!\"),Rio Bravois on a much more modest scale. Basically, it comes down to Sheriff John T. Chance (Wayne), his sobering-up alcoholic friend Dude (Dean Martin), the hotshot new kid Colorado (Ricky Nelson), and deputy-sidekick Stumpy (Walter Brennan), sittin' around in the town jail, drinkin' black cofee, shootin' the breeze, and occasionally, singin' a song. Hawks--who, like his pal Ernest Hemingway, lived by the code of \"grace under pressure\"--said he madeRio Bravoas a rebuke toHigh Noon, in which sheriff Gary Cooper begged for townspeople to help him. So, Hawks made Wayne's Sheriff Chance a consummate professional--he may be getting old and fat, but he knows how to do his job, and he doesn't want amateurs getting mixed up in his business; they could get hurt. This most entertaining of movies also achieved some notoriety in the '90s when Quentin Tarantino (director ofPulp Fiction,Reservoir Dogs, andJackie Brown) revealed that he uses it as a litmus test for prospective girlfriends. Oh, and if the configuration of characters sounds familiar, it should: Hawks remadeRio Bravotwo more times--asEl Doradoin 1967, with Wayne, Robert Mitchum, and James Caan; and asRio Loboin 1970, with Wayne, Jack Elam, and Christopher Mitchum.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792110188", "6301802330", "6300267938", "6304457308", "0792106989", "630197705X", "6300268799", "6300181588", "6301798090", "B000GX4476", "0792107128", "6304457316", "6304457278", "B000051S3Z", "6300183041", "0782008348", "0792105907", "6302320496", "6303471730", "B0018PH3L0", "B001E419N8", "B0000TANUI", "6301797922", "6301805518", "6300215733", "6300988473", "6301736362", "630150528X", "0790743213", "6303192254", "6300269884", "1555265952", "6301325508", "6300269043", "6303109950", "0792108868", "6304414099", "6304429711", "6302862906", "6303402070", "B00000I1DI", "6300216500", "0792838556", "6305237115", "B000GX7MMA", "6302990076", "B000056BRF", "630281622X", "6303101267", "0790727382", "6301976983", "6302032245", "6304286961", "6304071876"], "bought_together": ["0792110188", "6301802330"], "also_viewed": ["B000051S3Z"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 277544}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.89, "brand": "", "asin": "6300268470", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5127ECYB5EL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Rio Bravo [VHS]"}
{"description": "Anyone who fought in Vietnam can tell you that the war bore little resemblance to this propagandistic action film starring and codirected by John Wayne. But the film itself is not nearly as bad as its reputation would suggest; critics roasted its gung-ho politics while ignoring its merits as an exciting (if rather conventional and idealistic) war movie. Some notorious mistakes were made--in the final shot, the sun sets in the east!--and it's an awkward attempt to graft WWII heroics onto the Vietnam experience. But as the Duke's attempt to acknowledge the men who were fighting and dying overseas, it's a rousing film in which Wayne commands a regiment on a mission to kidnap a Viet Cong general. David Janssen plays a journalist who learns to understand Wayne's commitment to battling Communism, and Jim Hutton (Timothy's dad) plays an ill-fated soldier who adopts a Vietnamese orphan.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300181715", "0792106989", "6303057225", "B000051S3Z", "6300988473", "6301736362", "6300183041", "6300268748", "B000GX4476", "6300208281", "6300267938", "B0009ML2JC", "6300215733", "6303192254", "0792102320", "6303686907", "6301797922", "0792110188", "630018627X", "6301802330", "6302158176", "630150528X", "6301976924", "6304457316", "6301325508", "6304935811"], "bought_together": ["6300181715"], "also_viewed": ["B000051S3Z", "6301736362"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 184276}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.44, "brand": "", "asin": "6300267830", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Z9GFPBN7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Green Berets [VHS]"}

(Superman IIIis far more Lesteresque.) Still, there is a lot to like about this movie, which finds Superman grappling with the conflict between his responsibilities as Earth's savior and his own needs of the heart. Choosing the latter, he gives up his powers to be with Lois Lane (Margot Kidder), but the timing is awful: three renegades from his home planet, Krypton, are smashing up the White House, aided by the mocking Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman).

{"description": "Director Francis Coppola's adaptation of the popular S.E. Hinton novel about the price of rebellious youth is notable chiefly for the stunning cast of young actors who went on to rich and varied careers. In supporting roles, the film features the likes of Tom Cruise, Patrick Swayze, Diane Lane, Rob Lowe, Emilio Estevez, and Tom Waits, among others. The story centers on two rival gangs in the early 1960s Midwest, and the violent turf wars that escalate and tragically claim young lives. C. Thomas Howell plays the central character who yearns to prove himself and be accepted by his older brothers' gang, while at the same time finding his first love and dreaming of a life beyond his dead end existence. Geared toward the teenage crowd, the film nonetheless features some fine direction from Coppola in a story that evokes memories of the classic coming-of-age films of the 1950s.--Robert Lane", "related": {"bought_together": ["014240733X"], "also_viewed": ["014240733X", "6303212379", "0767825411", "6300214540", "B00000JPH5", "6301412761", "B00004TWZK", "B000GG4Y4Q"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 273988}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.99, "brand": "Zoethrope Studios", "asin": "6300270033", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51C1CHEJJTL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Outsiders [VHS]"}

{"description": "The off-Broadway comedy-horror-musical hit that ran for years makes a successful transfer to film with a bevy of big-name cameos and two perfectly cast leads. Rick Moranis is the nebbish Seymour, who pines for flower-girl Audrey (Ellen Greene) while living in the basement of florist Mr. Mushnik (Vincent Gardenia). Things start turning around for Seymour, though, after he buys a little plant during a solar eclipse, christens it Audrey II, and discovers that it likes to drink blood. Soon enough, though, Seymour finds out that Audrey II, now grown to epic proportions, is in actuality a \"mean green mother from outer space\" that is hell-bent on world domination. Based on the 1960 Roger Corman cheapie that featured a young Jack Nicholson,Little Shopboasts a hilarious, amazing score by Howard Ashman and Alan Menken, who would go on to revitalize Disney's animation arm withThe Little MermaidandBeauty and the Beast. Greene, the lone holdover from the original cast, is a ravishing, goofy Audrey, whose awkward demeanor belies a voice that could knock Ethel Merman off her feet. She's ably matched by Moranis, whose lack of a singing voice is perfectly in sync with Seymour's nerdiness. And Levi Stubbs Jr. of the Four Tops provides the lowdown, nasty-minded voice of Audrey II; his rendition of the Oscar-nominated \"Mean Green Mother from Outer Space\" is a showstopper. As for those celebrity cameos, Steve Martin's sadistic dentist is a masterful creation, as is Bill Murray's masochistic patient; John Candy, James Belushi, and Christopher Guest also pop up. And there was never a lovelier and funkier Greek chorus than the three Motown-fueled girls (Tichina Arnold, Michelle Weeks, and Tisha Campbell) who appear throughout the film.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301871952", "B00000JGEI", "6303212379"], "also_viewed": ["B006ZUMNPY", "6302890926", "B00005BGO9"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 66547}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6300271285", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51NA5EZ89NL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Little Shop of Horrors [VHS]"}

The storytelling was never as lean as inDumbo, the songs rarely as haunting (or just plain weird), the characters rarely so well defined. The film pits the \"cold, cruel, heartless\" world that can't accept abnormality against a plucky, and mute, hero. Jumbo Jr. (Dumbo is a mean-spirited nickname) is ostracized from the circus pack shortly after his delivery by the stork because of his big ears. His mother sticks up for him and is shackled. He's jeered by children (an insightful scene has one boy poking fun at Dumbo's ears, even though the youngster's ears are also ungainly), used by the circus folk, and demoted to appearing with the clowns. Only the decent Timothy Q. Mouse looks out for the little guy. Concerns about the un-PC \"Jim Crow\" crows, who mock Dumbo with the wonderful \"When I See an Elephant Fly,\" should be moderated by remembering that the crows are the only social group in the film who act kindly to the little outcast.

{"description": "Director Martin Brest rocketed to the top of Hollywood's A list with the blockbuster success ofBeverly Hills Cop, and this 1988 follow-up is even better.Midnight Runis a genuine rarity--an action comedy that's dramatically satisfying--thanks to a sharp script by George Gallo, the superb teaming of Robert De Niro and Charles Grodin, and Brest's consummate skill in combining suspense and humor with well-developed characters. De Niro plays a maverick bounty hunter whose latest assignment is Grodin, an accountant accused of embezzling from the Mob. De Niro thinks he's in for an easy job, transporting Grodin (who's afraid to fly) from New York to Los Angeles, but soon discovers that both the FBI and the Mafia are hot on Grodin's trail. Equal parts road trip, action thriller, and a quirky character study,Midnight Runmoves at a breakneck pace but still gives De Niro and Grodin time to create rich, memorable performances as two men who seem to be opposites, but gradually develop mutual respect and admiration. Mainstream entertainment at its best.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0790701251", "B003MG6FJY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 344826}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.09, "brand": "", "asin": "6301221486", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/517GF8AYZKL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Midnight Run [VHS]"}

{"description": "Meticulously crafted but also ponderous and predictable, James Cameron's 1989 deep-sea close-encounter epic reaffirms one of the oldest first principles of cinema: everything moves a lot more slowly underwater. Ed Harris and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, as formerly married petroleum engineers who still have some \"issues\" to work out, are drafted to assist a gung-ho Navy SEAL (Michael Biehn) with a top-secret recovery operation: a nuclear sub has been ambushed and sunk, under mysterious circumstances, in some of the deepest waters on earth, and the petro-techies have the only submersible craft capable of diving down that far. Every image and every performance is painstakingly sharp and detailed (and the computerized water creatures are lovely) but the movie's lumbering pace is ultimately lethal. It's the audience that ends up feeling waterlogged. For a guy who likes guns as much as Cameron (his next film after all, was the body-count masterpieceTerminator&nbsp;2: Judgment Day), it's interesting that the moral balance here is weighted heavily in favor of the can-do engineers; the military types are end-justifies-the-means amoralists, just like the weasely government bureaucrats inAliens.--David Chute", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301208773", "0767825411", "6305363668", "1558808221", "6300247171", "B00006RCSC", "6303148352", "6303257844", "B00000JGEI", "6303942830", "6305142467", "6303313345", "B000003KHS", "630407185X", "6304233639", "6304071876", "6300214826", "B000005QWI", "6303020089", "6302909023", "6301562178", "0800132009", "B00000ILE6", "B0001VL30O", "0800116917", "6303269834", "B0000CDL3W", "079073799X", "0783222955", "6301628454", "B00007CVYA", "6305718792", "B000054OW2", "6304259131"], "also_viewed": ["B00000JGEI", "6301792734", "6305363668", "6300213668", "6301208773", "6304233639", "0800125762", "6300213730", "6303402348", "6300214435", "6304117752", "0671676253", "6302814782", "0792151712", "0790740265", "6303257844", "B002GHHHKQ", "6303313345", "B001AQO3QA", "B007SPPANM", "B0087F7VSY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 435209}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.96, "brand": "", "asin": "6301562941", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/11JCR407ZAL.jpg", "title": "Abyss [VHS]"}
{"description": "Joseph Mankiewicz's moody classic is less ghost story than romantic fantasy, a handsome 1947 drama of impossible love set on the picturesque turn-of-the-century New England coast. Independent young widow Lucy Muir (the luminous Gene Tierney), desperate to escape her uptight in-laws, falls in love with a grand seaside house and moves in, only to discover the cantankerous ghost of the hot-tempered Captain Gregg (a histrionically flamboyant performance by Rex Harrison). Lucy refuses to let the bombastic captain frighten her away, earning his respect, his friendship, and later his love. They team up to turn the captain's salty memoirs into a bestseller, but as his affection grows he fades away, leaving Lucy free to undertake a more worldly suitor, notably a charismatic children's author (George Sanders at his smarmy smoothest) with his own guarded secret. Charles Lang's melancholy black-and-white photography and Bernard Herrmann's haunting score set the tone for this sublime adult drama, and Tierney delivers one of her most understated performances as the resolute Mrs. Muir. Mankiewicz turns this ghost story into a refreshingly mature and down-to-earth romance.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["630266232X", "6302320496", "6302227127", "630150528X", "0767825616", "630197350X", "0792151712", "B00005A1VH", "6303402070", "B00003OSTO", "6303057225", "6300988791", "B00000JKNL", "6301773586", "0783235593", "6301977688", "0783221347", "6301586050", "6301964012", "0780614097", "6300183912", "6305126062", "6301670140", "6301978536", "6301972171", "6303120474", "6301969049", "6303364772", "B0000068Z8", "6301797906", "1558807780", "0783236352", "B000GX4476", "6302130379", "B00000IBME", "B003MG6FJY", "6301628616", "6303209890", "0790743159", "6300181340", "B000CQD1ZS", "B000006FR5", "B00000F13X", "6301797957", "6301986040", "6302464889", "5559477621", "6300267970", "6302800897"], "bought_together": ["6302320496"], "also_viewed": ["6304005490", "0783235593"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 113812}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 10.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6301586042", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HEY8NM3EL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Ghost &amp; Mrs Muir [VHS]"}
{"description": "A perfect example of what critic Manny Farber once described as \"termite art\"--that which burrows under and gets inside its subject rather than indulging in rhetoric--HELL IS FOR HEROES stars Steve McQueen as the rebellious G.I. John Reese. In the fall of 1944, he's busted from staff sergeant back to private for drunkenness and is sent back to his former outfit, currently stationed near the Siegfried Line in Montigny. Reese's bitterness about his demotion isolates him from the rest of the squad, although they've observed his courage under fire in previous combat missions. When the unit is assigned to defend an area facing a German pillbox, Reese's skills become evident. He advises squad leader Sgt. Larkin (Harry Guardino) on a ruse that creates the illusion that their unit is much larger than it is, temporarily deflecting an attack. The squad has been ordered to simply hold their ground, but believing it's only a matter of time before the Germans discover that they've been deceived, Reese leads an attack on the pillbox. McQueen is excellent in this solid, realistic grunt's-eye-view of combat, which suggests that sociopaths make the best soldiers. James Coburn and Mike Kellin do fine work, and Bob Newhart is featured in a strangely anomalous comic turn.", "related": {"also_viewed": ["0792115449"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 216710}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.5, "brand": "", "asin": "6301608534", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HBQP3SJCL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Hell Is for Heroes [VHS]"}

The mass of humanity has descended into speechless savagery, kept as captive animals by the talking apes who have inherited the world. Two astronauts from our time have landed here, retracing the path of their lost comrade, Captain Taylor (Charlton Heston). Unfortunately, they've landed in the middle of a grim situation. Warlike gorillas are preparing to eliminate the last shards of shattered human civilization, a degenerate, subterranean cult worshipping the greatest of all human achievements--the cobalt bomb. As well as rescuing Taylor, the two men have to stop the gorillas from wiping out humanity ... and stop humanity from fulfilling their self-appointed, self-destructive destiny. This is both thrill-a-minute science fiction and a surprisingly deep reflection on the human condition.

{"description": "Showered with Oscars, this wonderfully bitchy (and witty) comedy written and directed by Joseph&nbsp;L. Mankiewicz concerns an aging theater star (Bette Davis) whose life is being supplanted by a wolf-in-sheep's-clothing ingenue (Anne Baxter) whom she helped.

{"description": "Part mystery, part wartime polemic,Lifeboatfinds director Alfred Hitchcock tackling a cinematic challenge that foreshadows the self-imposed handicaps ofRopeandRear Window. As with those subsequent features, Hitchcock confines his action and characters to a single set, in this instance the lone surviving lifeboat from an Allied freighter sunk by a German U-boat in the North Atlantic. A less confident, ingenious filmmaker might have opened up John Steinbeck's dialogue-driven character study beyond the battered boat and its cargo of survivors, but Hitchcock instead revels in his predicament to exploit the enforced intimacy between his characters.Indeed, we never actually see the doomed freighter--the smoking ship's funnel beneath the credits simply sinks beneath the waves, and we're plunged into the escalating tensions between those who gradually find their way to the boat, a band of eight English and American passengers and crew, plus a German sailor (Walter Slezak) rescued from the U-boat, itself destroyed by the freighter's deck gun. Heading the cast and inevitably commanding their and our attention is the cello-voiced Tallulah Bankhead as Connie Porter, a cynical, sophisticated writer whose priorities seem to be hanging onto her mink and keeping her lipstick fresh. Gradually, the others find Porter and her lifeboat, forming a temporary community that inevitably suggests a careful cross section of archetypes, from wealthy industrialist (Henry Hull) to ship's boiler men (John Hodiak and William Bendix).Hitchcock juggles the interpersonal skirmishes between the boat's occupants with the mystery of their German prisoner, which itself becomes a meditation on the fine line between nationalism and morality, a line that Slezak walks delicately until his identity is resolved. Visually, Hitchcock transforms his back-lot set and its rear-projected cloudbanks into a desolate stretch of ocean, while capturing the horror of an amputation through an economical set of images culminating in an empty boot.--Sam Sutherland", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0045HCJ9E", "6302413435", "0783236352", "B002GSXKQA", "0790743159", "1558807780", "6301800974", "0783235623", "0769403468", "6301640667", "6301975987", "6301973232", "1558808590", "630150528X", "0800100832", "6301564456", "6302226899", "6301959728", "B000EVD38G", "B00004R67T", "6302909023", "B00005Q4GY", "6304457316", "0790743213", "6300246965", "6301798503", "6302360978", "0783221347", "6301797957", "6301973410", "6300183580", "6304196954", "6301798708", "B000056BRF", "6302842263", "6304359705", "0792108280", "079074886X"], "also_viewed": ["B001D8W7F4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 319371}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6301798732", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51AC1NXHYzL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Lifeboat (The Hitchcock Collection) [VHS]"}
{"description": "A flawed but stylish adaptation of the Chester Gould comic strip by director Warren Beatty, who also stars in the title role. The minimalist plot involves a battalion of baddies who confront the intrepid detective in a series of strung-together vignettes. Al Pacino is a comedic if overblown standout as Big Boy Caprice, and Madonna simply smolders as aggressive blonde bombshell Breathless Mahoney. It matters not that the plot is Spartan, as this dazzling eye candy is much enhanced by Stephen Sondheim's songs, including the Academy Award-winning ditty, \"Sooner or Later (I Always Get My Man).\" Beatty took his cue from the source material and concentrated on the relationships between these people, whether strained, romantic, or hateful. The performances are subtle and more amusing than you would expect from such a visually bold picture. Shot in bright, primary colors, this also won Oscars for Best Art/Set Direction and Makeup (for those inventively hideous criminals).

Having arrived atDiscoverynear the planet Jupiter, the American mission leader (Roy Scheider) and his Russian counterpart (Helen Mirren) must investigate the apparent failure of the ship's infamous onboard computer, HAL 9000, as well as the meaning of countless mysterious black monoliths amassing on Jupiter's surface (an interpretation Kubrick originally left up to his viewers).

{"description": "Writer-director Sam Raimi's extremely stylized, blood-soaked follow-up to his creepyEvil Deadisn't really a sequel; rather, it's a remake on a better budget. It also isn't really a horror film (though there are plenty of decapitations, zombies, supernatural demons, and gore) as much as it is a hilarious, sophisticated slapstick send-up of the terror genre. Raimi takes every horror convention that exists and exaggerates it with mind-blowing special effects, crossed with mocking Three Stooges humor. The plot alone is a genre clich&eacute; right out of any number of horror films. Several teens (including our hero, Ash, played by Bruce Campbell in a manic tour-de-force of physical comedy) visit a broken-down cottage in the woods--miles from civilization--find a copy of the Book of the Dead, and unleash supernatural powers that gut every character in sight.

{"description": "With Michael Curtiz (Casablanca) as director, Cary Grant in the  lead, and wall-to-wall songs by Cole Porter, how couldNight and Daylose? Why, by taking broad liberties with the composer's life story and failing to live up to expectations. If you can overlook such shortcomings, however, it's lively entertainment that doesn't completely deserve the scorn it has elicited. Grant is good as a bon vivant who had a way with words but lacked the discipline to pursue a career in law. As a singer, on the other hand, he's merely adequate. Curtiz wisely has the fine supporting actresses (Jane Wyman, Ginny Simms, etc.) handle the big numbers such  as \"You're the Top.\" Also, Porter's story was meant for black and white. The  Technicolor process adds an unfortunate garishness to the tale of a man whose  very name has become a synonym for elegance. With Mary Martin and Monty Woolley  as themselves.--Kathleen C.

On the 50th anniversary of Edison's greatest invention, the incandescent lightbulb, the elderly man thinks back on his life and his most creative period. He remembers the early setbacks in his career, his undaunting determination, and his happy family life with his wife, Mary Stillwell (Rita Johnson). This well-researched biopic features a remarkable lead performance from Spencer Tracy, who spent a period of time in Edison's hometown of Menlo Park, New Jersey, where he stayed in his laboratory and researched his journals and letters.

{"description": "Amazon.com Review:  A last attempt to squeeze some laughs out of the team of Richard Pryor and Gene Wilder, Another You mostly conjures up pleasant memories of Silver Streak and Stir Crazy. Pryor plays a con man forced to tend a pathological liar (Wilder), who's immediately mistaken as a missing millionaire--a mistake that could pay off big. The storyline actually holds promise as a classic screwball comedy outline, but the movie doesn't build any snap or crackle, and promising set-ups dribble away. Even the once-electric chemistry between the stars has faded. Wilder displays that eerie sadness and stillness he brings to his comedic roles, but here he looks stranded. Pryor's ferocious talent is muted and his onscreen energy is turned down low; his reliance on easy profanity feels a little desperate. This was his final starring role before illness took him out of movies. --Robert Horton", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 646931}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 21.95, "brand": "", "asin": "630226197X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51248DZFZML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Another You [VHS]"}

{"description": "Rodan\" is frequently compared to studio-mate Godzilla in many ways. I think that \"Rodan\" is at least as well made and in some ways superior to any of the Godzilla films. For starters it is in color, which was a bit rare for a film made in 1956; furthermore, the color is vibrant and well preserved in this modern print. The acting is better than most of the Toho films, as is the script. The biggest difference is the sets, with the \"Rodan\" sets far and away more realistic looking than the Godzilla counterparts. The blending of real shots and miniatures is far above average for a film of this age as well. The 'bridge' set featured near the end of the film is probably the best miniature set in the history of Toho productions. \nRodan is a message movie, and, of course, cautions us about the use of nuclear weapons. The use of these weapons causes first the release of some just plain wacky looking caterpillar monsters, followed by two Rodans.

Shown along with the famous \"duck and cover\" Civil Defense films are lesser-known clips, many of which possess a bizarre black humor when seen today, and it's easy to see why this film, which was produced in the early 1980s, became a cult classic sometimes referred to as the \"nuclearReefer Madness.\" Bellicose congressmen are shown advocating a freewheeling policy of nuclear strikes against China during the Korean War, suburban families are shown enjoying the comforts of their bomb shelters, and footage of a boy trying to bicycle to a bomb shelter in a \"bomb survival suit\" his father designed is priceless.Atomic Cafeis at once clever and poignant, a canny and offbeat look at a significant period in American history.--Robert J.

Orpheus, a trolley car conductor and superb samba dancer, is engaged to Mira but in love with Eurydice. For his change of heart, Orpheus and his new doomed lover are pursued by a vengeful Mira and a determined Death through the feverish Carnival night. Camus at once demystifies and remystifies the old story, shifting not only its location but its tone and context, forcing a reevaluation of the legend as a more passionate, pulsing, sensual experience.

{"description": "Certain to remain one of the greatest haunted-house movies ever made, Robert Wise'sThe Haunting(1963) is antithetical to all the gory horror films of subsequent decades, because its considerable frights remain implicitly rooted in the viewer's sensitivity to abject fear. A classic spook-fest based on Shirley Jackson's novelThe Haunting of Hill House(which also inspired the 1999 remake directed by Jan de Bont), the film begins with a prologue that concisely establishes the dark history of Hill House, a massive New England mansion (actually filmed in England) that will play host to four daring guests determined to investigate--and hopefully debunk--the legacy of death and ghostly possession that has given the mansion its terrifying reputation.Consumed by guilt and grief over her mother's recent death and driven to adventure by her belief in the supernatural, Eleanor Vance (Julie Harris) is the most unstable--and therefore the most vulnerable--visitor to Hill House. She's invited there by anthropologist Dr. Markway (Richard Johnson), along with the bohemian lesbian Theodora (Claire Bloom), who has acute extra-sensory abilities, and glib playboy Luke Sanderson (Russ Tamblyn, from Wise'sWest Side Story), who will gladly inherit Hill House if it proves to be hospitable. Of course, the shadowy mansion is anything but welcoming to its unwanted intruders. Strange noises, from muffled wails to deafening pounding, set the stage for even scarier occurrences, including a door that appears tobreathe(with a slowly turning doorknob that's almost unbearably suspenseful), unexplained writing on walls, and a delicate spiral staircase that seems to have a life of its own.The genius ofThe Hauntinglies in the restraint of Wise and screenwriter Nelson Gidding, who elicit almost all of the film's mounting terror from the psychology of its characters--particularly Eleanor, whose grip on sanity grows increasingly tenuous. The presence of lurking spirits relies heavily on the power of suggestion (likewise the cautious handling of Theodora's attraction to Eleanor) and the film's use of sound is more terrifying than anything Wise could have shown with his camera. Like Jack Clayton's 1961 chiller,The Innocents,The Hauntingknows the value of planting the seeds of terror in the mind, as opposed to letting them blossom graphically on the screen. What you don't see is infinitely more frightening than what you do, and with nary a severed head or bloody corpse in sight,The Hauntingis guaranteed to chill you to the bone.--Jeff Shannon", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 433958}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6302872766", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5169GTZZBNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Haunting [VHS]"}
{"description": "Made two years afterCitizen Kane, this 1943 version of Charlotte Bront&#xEB;'sJane Eyresure looks like star Orson Welles muscled his way behind the camera much of the time. (In fact, costar Joan Fontaine--who plays the title character--has maintained that Welles methodically did just that every day on the set.) Not that the film's official director was a hack: Robert Stevenson, who later had a busy career at Disney making numerous live-action hits for the studio, such asMary Poppins, gets the credit. But there's no mistaking Welles's masterful hand in the film's bold and creative look, and there's no getting away from his enigmatic charisma as Rochester, the widower who takes in Jane as a governess to his daughter. An engrossing, gorgeous film, there's even a small role for Elizabeth Taylor at the beginning as Jane's unlucky, doomed friend at a cruel boarding school.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302278929", "6302148669", "B001D8W7EU", "6300248550", "6302363292", "6301670140", "6301967496", "6303364772", "630310245X", "6301973410", "630150528X", "6301797957", "B000056BRF", "B000021Y6K", "B000003KE0", "630160086X", "630196912X", "6302226899", "6302120527", "B000006GCU", "630266232X", "B000005XPV", "6302503493", "6302374227", "6301977815", "6303002064", "6300267970", "B007RKFY98", "0783236352", "B003MG6FJY", "6302593220", "6301661826", "6302098424", "6304509146", "6301805615", "0790733935", "6302004446", "6302413419", "6300183920", "B00000I1DI", "630196571X", "6301978536", "6300215741", "0792107683", "6301706587", "B00005A1VH", "6301628667", "6300268799", "6300269310", "6300208133", "0792845684"], "bought_together": ["6302278929"], "also_viewed": ["B000784WMW", "B00AATUZQA", "B0053Q9DHW", "B000LPQ6DE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 279347}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.89, "brand": "", "asin": "6302878535", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51KMCKYK08L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Jane Eyre [VHS]"}

{"description": "Cecil B. DeMille's pre-Hays Code Roman costume drama manages to mix fast-and-loose historical facts with melodrama and titillation. Fredric March plays Marcus Superbus, a Roman soldier and womanizer who jeopardizes his position in Nero's storm troopers by developing a crush on a beautiful Christian girl, Mercia (Elissa Landi). With the Christians keeping their faith far underground, Superbus walks a tightrope between his obligations to the state and his love for Mercia until she and her family are rounded up and hauled off to the arena.The Sign of the Crossis not without its problems; by modern standards, it often seems slow and stagy, and its moralistic message comes across as blunt and heavy-handed. DeMille, however, shrewdly knew how to keep an audience's attention in ways that would have been impossible in subsequent years. Consider Claudette Colbert as the alluring, evil Poppaea, lolling in a bath of asses' milk with her breasts almost completely exposed. Or there's the scene where Marcus tries to get Mercia to loosen up a bit; his idea of a fun time is to take her to an orgy where she's groped by a lesbian during an erotic dance. Then there's Charles Laughton as the decadent Nero, his fey manner abetted by an oiled-up boy-toy at his side in nearly every scene. The climactic scenes at the arena are still violent today, with Christians being gnawed by lions, gladiators knocking each other's brains out, and an Amazon spearing a Pygmy and carrying him around like a kebab!The Sign of the Crosswas heavily cut for rerelease in later years but is now available again in its uncut form.--Jerry Renshaw", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303382991"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 395759}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.62, "brand": "", "asin": "6303382967", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51E06X5ME0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Sign of the Cross [VHS]"}

The saucers' helmeted pilots land on Earth and deliver an ultimatum to humanity via Marlowe: fealty or complete annihilation.Harryhausen's painstakingly intricate saucers and the destruction they wreak (particularly during an assault on Washington, D.C.) are the film's unquestionable highlights, but Marlowe and Joan Taylor (as his wife/partner) are capable leads, and veteran B director Fred F.

{"description": "A young Paris housewife, S&eacute;verine, grows bored with her stable husband. When she learns of the presence of a high-class brothel in her neighborhood, she quietly goes to work there--but only during the day, until five o'clock in the afternoon. This sublime 1967 film is one of the latter-day masterpieces of the Spanish-born director Luis Bu&ntilde;uel, whose career forms one of the greatest and boldest arcs in cinema. By the time ofBelle de jour, Bu&ntilde;uel had become almost completely deadpan in his style, which not only leaves the motivation of S&eacute;verine a mystery (despite a few flashbacks to degradations of her youth), but also casts the entire plot in doubt. An old surrealist from the 1920s (when his first classic,Un chien andalou, was made in collaboration with Salvador Dali), Bu&ntilde;uel suggests that what we see may be real, or simply S&eacute;verine's imagination. Because he was the least pretentious of directors, Bu&ntilde;uel keeps his material playful, wicked, yet cutting. As S&eacute;verine, the impossibly lovely Catherine Deneuve uses her cool demeanor to great effect--she never breaks her deadpan, either. In 1995, after having been out of official circulation for years,Belle de Jourwas re-released in America and became an unexpected art-house hit.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301442768", "6305372594", "6300208591", "6301966015"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 355577}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6303855490", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41JX1GRW6RL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Belle De Jour [VHS]"}
{"description": "You won't find a smarter, more amusing, or more accurate send-up of low-budget filmmaking than Tom DiCillo's 1995 independent feature,Living in Oblivion, wherein a motley cast of would-be artistes blunders its way through a day on the set. Steve Buscemi plays goateed Nick Reve, a harried, sweating director whose crew of numbskulls and egotists seems hell-bent on ruining his film. The trials and tribulations of independent filmmaking are not foreign material for writer-director DiCillo, who cut his teeth as Jim Jarmusch's cinematographer on 1985'sStranger Than Paradisebefore going on to direct his own work, such as the offbeat 1992 comedyJohnny Suede. Like that film,Living in Oblivionrides a precariously thin line between the real and the surreal, featuring a midget actor and an exploding smoke-effects machine, as well as a ridiculously narcissistic Brad Pittesque character played by James Le Gros. While films likeGet Shorty, Fran&#xE7;ois Truffaut'sDay for Night, and Jean-Luc Godard'sContemptsuggest that moviemaking is hip and glamorous,Living in Oblivionwill have none of that. The film within the film feels like a director's primer on what not to do, and this modest-budget gem both lovingly and caustically strips the \"cool\" veneer from the filmmaking process.

Seeking a hotel room and the whereabouts of an ethnic Japanese farmer named Komoko, MacReedy runs smack into a wall of hostility that escalates into serious threats. In time it becomes apparent that Komoko has been murdered by a local, racist chieftain, Reno Smith (Robert Ryan), who also plans on dispensing with MacReedy. Tracy's hero is forced to fight his way past Smith's goons (among them Ernest Borgnine and Lee Marvin) and sundry allies (Anne Francis) to keep alive, setting the stage for memorable suspense crisply orchestrated by Sturges.

{"description": "Hollywood's legendary \"woman's director,\" George Cukor (The Women,The Philadelphia Story), transformed Audrey Hepburn into street-urchin-turned-proper-lady Eliza Doolittle in this film version of the Lerner and Loewe musical.

This time, we follow the fortunes of four people who lock themselves inside a shopping mall to get away from the marauding dead and who then immerse themselves in unabashed consumerism, taking what they want from an array of clothing and jewelry shops, making gourmet meals, etc. It is Romero's take on Louis XVI in the modern world: keep the starving masses at bay and crank up the insulated indulgence.

{"description": "Having developed his skill as a master of contemporary crime drama, writer-director Michael Mann displayed every aspect of that mastery in this intelligent, character-driven thriller from 1995, which also marked the first onscreen pairing of Robert De&nbsp;Niro and Al Pacino. The two great actors had played father and son in the separate time periods ofThe Godfather, Part&nbsp;II, but this was the first film in which the pair appeared together, and although their only scene together is brief, it's the riveting fulcrum of this high-tech cops-and-robbers scenario. De&nbsp;Niro plays a master thief with highly skilled partners (Val Kilmer and Tom Sizemore) whose latest heist draws the attention of Pacino, playing a seasoned Los Angeles detective whose investigation reveals that cop and criminal lead similar lives. Both are so devoted to their professions that their personal lives are a disaster. Pacino's with a wife (Diane Venora) who cheats to avoid the reality of their desolate marriage; De&nbsp;Niro pays the price for a life with no outside connections; and Kilmer's wife (Ashley Judd) has all but given up hope that her husband will quit his criminal career. These are men obsessed, and as De&nbsp;Niro and Pacino know, they'll both do whatever's necessary to bring the other down. Mann's brilliant screenplay explores these personal obsessions and sacrifices with absorbing insight, and the tension mounts with some of the most riveting action sequences ever filmed--most notably a daylight siege that turns downtown Los Angeles into a virtual war zone of automatic gunfire. At nearly three hours, the film qualifies as a kind of intimate epic, certain to leave some viewers impatiently waiting for more action, but it's all part of Mann's compelling strategy.Heatis a true rarity: a crime thriller with equal measures of intense excitement and dramatic depth, giving De&nbsp;Niro and Pacino a prime showcase for their finely matched talents.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000003KHS", "6300183211", "B00000IO4G", "630018627X", "6303421563", "B00000JGEI", "6302415853", "630018403X", "0800199421", "6304258984", "0784011923", "6304259131", "6302482712", "6303953425", "B00007CVYA", "0783223218", "6300214540", "6302054982", "0790731274", "B00000ILE6", "0792147618", "079073799X", "6301208773", "6301888901", "0790701251", "0792133153", "6302378648", "6302282535", "6305718792", "6304414099", "6303696813", "0790748169", "B0002ZDVFE", "B000077VT7", "6303269834", "6302516919", "630428649X", "B00008R9K9", "6303036570", "6302814782", "0792116887", "0792158261", "0790705141", "6304508611", "6301071379", "B00005Q4GY", "076783819X", "6300214567", "6303020089", "6303383300", "6302945089", "B0002GTWOM", "B00003CXE6", "0792841778", "6301797930", "0800116917", "0800179552", "B0000040EJ", "B00005A7VC", "6300182878"], "also_viewed": ["B000003KHS"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 286071}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.98, "brand": "", "asin": "6304214502", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4160ZFH45VL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Heat [VHS]"}
{"description": "They call itGiantbecause everything in this picture is big, from the generous running time (more than 200 minutes) to the sprawling ranch location (a horizon-to-horizon plain with a lonely, modest mansion dropped in the middle) to the high-powered stars. Stocky Rock Hudson stars as the confident, stubborn young ranch baron Bick Benedict, who woos and wins the hand of Southern belle Elizabeth Taylor, a seemingly demure young beauty who proves to be Hudson's match after she settles into the family homestead. For many the film is chiefly remembered for James Dean's final performance, as poor former ranch hand Jett Rink, who strikes oil and transforms himself into a flamboyant millionaire playboy. Director George Stevens won his second Oscar for this ambitious, grandly realized (if sometimes slow moving) epic of the changing socioeconomic (and physical) landscape of modern Texas, based on Edna Ferber's bestselling novel. The talented supporting cast includes Mercedes McCambridge as Bick's frustrated sister, put out by the new \"woman of the house\"; Chill Wills as the Benedicts' garrulous rancher neighbor; Carroll Baker and Dennis Hopper as the Benedicts' rebellious children; and Earl Holliman and Sal Mineo as dedicated ranch hands.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000059HH1", "6302797616", "6305123616", "1569942072", "B000005PPB", "6300182371", "6300215830", "B000006FKX", "6301045750", "B00068S41I", "0792107683", "6300183890", "B000A1KF8Q", "6301599225", "B000054OW2", "6300215644", "B00004TX2D", "6302655897", "0767825616", "6301976622", "0792839129", "B00005A1VH"], "bought_together": ["6302797616", "B000059HH1"], "also_viewed": ["B004XKVP7K", "B0007TKNK6", "B0000040EJ", "B0000068ZQ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 221648}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.98, "brand": "", "asin": "6304239149", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51MN3CNVQYL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Giant (Special Widescreen Edition) [VHS]"}

{"description": "When a slightly cross-eyed Siamese cat named D.C. (Darn Cat) turns up  with a wristwatch around his  neck instead of a collar, it could be just the clue the FBI needs to  crack a series of bank robberies in this lightweight comedy from  Disney.  The watch belongs to a bank teller who  has been taken hostage.  Dean Jones stars as the good-hearted FBI agent  assigned to the case.  Unfortunately, he is highly allergic to, you guessed  it, cats.  Hayley Mills is D.C.'s doting owner who hatches a hair-brained  scheme to follow D.C.'s every move until he returns to the crooks' hideout  where he got the wristwatch.  After a lot of sneezing, slapstick, and comedic intrigue, the bank robbers are foiled, the hostage is safe, and everyone is  happy. An impressive supporting cast of Frank Gorshin, Elsa Lanchester,  Roddy McDowall, and Ed Wynn add to the zaniness. Released in 1965 (and remade in 1997), it is understandably dated, but the performances are fun  nonetheless.  Hayley Mills is delightful as the determined and unflappable  wannabe sleuth, and Dean Jones proves he is adept at physical comedy. This is a movie of little consequence, just a clean, fun diversion that the  whole family can watch. The theme song is sung by Bobby Darin.--Peggy Maltby-Etra", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301727630", "6304675143", "6302271991", "0788811207", "B00005RRG5", "B0000022WA", "6304500718", "0788806661", "0788810987", "B00005RRG6", "0788806734", "6304368534", "6302961572", "0788811266", "6301390725", "155890641X", "B0001I55OW", "6302271967", "0788806742", "6302320402", "078881172X", "B00005RRG3", "B0001HAFIO", "6302126169", "0788811428", "078881141X", "6304500726", "B00000I0V5", "6304675151", "B00006472N", "630440123X", "0788811436", "6301708156", "B000006212", "6304293925", "6302426200", "6301991311", "B00000ICHA", "6301708288", "B000055ZJP", "6300274586", "6303854311", "6303494390", "6304029284"], "bought_together": ["6301727630", "6304675143"], "also_viewed": ["B00005RRG5", "6304400551", "B00004R99N", "6303036813", "B00005RRG3", "6304500831", "0788811207", "6303315305", "B00005RRG6", "6301390725", "6304290888", "B001KRCDSY", "0788806734", "B00000623Y", "6300275310", "6305177473", "B000009CTR", "6301727630", "6304311834", "B00005RRG9", "0788812181", "0788812408", "B000BUUL94", "6301991311", "6302320402", "6303534422", "B00005RDWC", "B0009X75QU", "B0000022WA", "6304155972", "6304089112"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 287676}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.5, "brand": "", "asin": "6304285388", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/511HMK3J7RL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "That Darn Cat!

{"description": "Goldie Hawn, Bette Midler, and Diane Keaton prove that revenge is a dish best served cold. Former college buddies, they reunite at the funeral of a dear friend who took a swan dive onto Fifth Avenue. All three discover they share the same unhappy history of husbands who dove into middle-age by dumping them for trophy wives. Forming a warring triumvirate, they decide to get even, and along the way remind themselves of long-forgotten capabilities. The action gets a little too \"wacky\" at times, but the gals are great. Portraying an aging actress, Hawn is sometimes a little too flamboyant, but there is much fun to be had in her flashiness, especially when she pokes fun at Tinseltown and her persona. Instead of her usual brashness, Midler stretches herself and shows us a woman who is not just unhappy, but also deeply sorrowful. Not that she isn't quick with a wisecrack, but her expressive face alone tells the story of her marriage. As the repressed and guilt-ridden spouse of a self- involved ad executive, Keaton finds her anger, and her voice, when her psychiatrist (Marcia Gay Harden) oversteps ethical boundaries. Watching Keaton grow from an ineffectual homemaker into a powerful businessperson reminds us that it has been far too long since she has done a comedy. Director Hugh Wilson smartly chose supporting players who each brought something unique to the film. However, he does not maintain the first hour's effervescent humor throughout the film, as the ending is weakened by a softening of the wives' resolve.--Rochelle O'Gorman", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 122332}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 0.92, "brand": "", "asin": "6304337183", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5179WY0WC0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The First Wives Club [VHS]"}

Kate Winslet is his cousin Sue Bridehead, a young woman with suffragette leanings and a position as a teacher's assistant.

{"description": "While scoring high-profile credits as a screenwriter (includingThe Empire Strikes Back,Return of the Jedi, andRaiders of the Lost Ark), Lawrence Kasdan made his directorial debut with this steamy, contemporary film noir in the tradition ofDouble Indemnityand other classics from the 1940s. In one of his most memorable roles, William Hurt plays a Florida lawyer unwittingly drawn into a web of deceit spun by Kathleen Turner (in her screen debut) as a married socialite who plots to kill off her husband with Hurt's assistance. Kasdan's dialogue is a hoot (sometimes it borders on satire), and the sultry atmosphere is a perfect complement to the perspiration-soaked chemistry between Hurt and Turner, whose love scenes caused quite a stir when the film was released in 1981. John Barry's score sets the provocative mood, and both Ted Danson and Mickey Rourke are splendid in memorable supporting roles.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305262268", "B00008CMRK", "B0043X1FNQ", "B002AS463W", "B000E5N684", "B000H5TH1Q", "B00005K3NU", "B0043X1FKY", "B00AEFXX9Q", "B00013RC66", "B00008L3S6", "6305308837", "0792844874", "B002VWNICC", "B00006RCNY", "B00006L91I", "B00005K3NV", "B00005R240", "0790730979", "B00006L92K", "B00000K3TU", "B0045HCJIK", "B000EQ5SRK", "B0001US62I", "B002AT8KAG", "B000FO0AA6", "079073219X", "B00005U2KC", "B0087ZG7OI", "076782170X", "B00AEFXN9G", "6305310335", "6305428484", "B0001GF2D8", "B0009GX1CE", "B0045O2PHS", "B00AEFYD2M", "B00005JKI5", "B0045HCJSU", "B00GHJ1YUI", "B002NZK5RI", "B00009Y3PV", "B000TXPXAU", "B00AEFXT1S", "B004SIP9CO", "B0010SAGHS", "B00005LC4D", "0783229402", "B00005JMIJ", "B00AEBBA4K", "B00005R5GD", "B0000TG8XY", "B00006472O", "B0052ADPAU", "B0009X75PQ", "B0018QPPXW", "0767827902", "B0045HCJ9E", "B00079Z9VO", "B000CBG5PG", "B0010YSD8Q", "B000P0J0AG", "B00BTYRB3U", "B00AEBB99Q", "B004YCKKFK", "6305132917", "B002VWNIAY", "B00AEFXBPM", "B00BTYHBX0", "B0007WQGS6", "B00AEFXIIW", "B00IKM5MIA", "0767821610", "B00005V9HH", "B000CNESU8", "B000PAAJZ6", "B00441GZ00", "B001B1UO7G", "B00BLN4UKQ", "B00871C09S", "B000FS9UKI", "B000FO0A9W", "B0000ZMGWK", "B001EKP5D2", "B00000G3I2", "B00009WVSL", "0790750198", "B00AEFYC96", "B0006IIPLM", "B000UGBOT0", "B000PMFRVU", "B00011CZRE", "B00005Y1UV", "B00AEBB9UK", "B004SIP7F8", "B00005V4XV", "B000063JDE", "B00JJ3EHCG", "B00C6F61HS"], "bought_together": ["6305262268", "B00008CMRK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000E5N684", "B002AS463W", "B00005K3NU", "6305262268"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 126482}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 13.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6304698518", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/513TG480WRL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Body Heat"}

{"description": "After starring in the now-legendary trilogy of spaghetti Westerns for Italian director Sergio Leone, Clint Eastwood became a box-office star and imported the style of those classic shoot-'em-ups for this 1967 Western directed by Ted Post, with whom Eastwood had worked during their days on the television seriesRawhide. Eastwood plays an innocent rancher who is mistaken for a cattle rustler and sentenced to hang by an angry mob. When he is saved from the noose by a passing lawman, he embarks on a renegade campaign of vengeance against the men who attempted to lynch him.Hang 'Em Highoffers a number of memorable moments and stylistic flourishes, and features a superb supporting cast of Western veterans, including Ben Johnson, Ed Begley, Pat Hingle, Dennis Hopper, Bruce Dern, L.Q.

{"description": "It's not quite as clever as it tries to be, butThe Gamedoes a tremendous job of presenting the story of a rigid control freak trapped in circumstances that are increasingly beyond his control. Michael Douglas plays a rich, divorced, and dreadful investment banker whose 48th birthday reminds him of his father's suicide at the same age. He's locked in the cage of his own misery until his rebellious younger brother (Sean Penn) presents him with a birthday invitation to play \"The Game\" (described as \"an experiential Book of the Month Club\")--a mysterious offering from a company called Consumer Recreation Services. Before he knows the game has even begun, Douglas is caught up in a series of unexplained events designed to strip him of his tenuous security and cast him into a maelstrom of chaos. How do you play a game that hasn't any rules? That's what Douglas has to figure out, and he can't always rely on his intelligence to form logic out of what's happening to him. Seemingly cast as the fall guy in a conspiracy thriller, he encounters a waitress (Deborah Unger) who may or may not be trustworthy, and nothing can be taken at face value in a world turned upside down. Douglas is great at conveying the sheer panic of his character's dilemma, and despite some lapses in credibility and an anticlimactic ending,The Gameremains a thinking person's thriller that grabs and holds your attention.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0784011923", "B00000JGEI", "B00003CXE6", "6303447589", "6302256615", "6304078250", "6303012140", "B00000JGEK", "6301520106", "0792838211", "0792839846", "B00003JRAB", "B000006ORX"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 399710}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.98, "brand": "", "asin": "6304765789", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZCZHZE36L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Game [VHS]"}

{"description": "It's no secret thatBuffycreator Joss Whedon was unhappy with the hilariously campy and  charming 1992 film about his vampire-slaying heroine. When the opportunity for the Warner Brothers series came  along, he set out to presenthiscomplete vision of the teen dream. This set is a nice introduction to Buffy (petite and pretty Sarah Michelle Gellar); her watcher Rupert Giles (Anthony Stewart Head); her best friend, the computer whiz Willow (winning Alyson Hannigan); their devoted but slightly goofy friend Xander (Nicholas Brendon), and the self-involved beauty Cordelia (Charisma Carpenter). Also featured is Buffy's angst-ridden, 240-year-old beau-to-be, Angel (David Boreanaz). Sunnydale, where former Los Angelean Buffy now resides, just happens to be at a Hellmouth opening, allowing for the presence of not only vampires, but all kinds of beasties and demons. This keeps Buffy and her posse very busy.The two-part opener, \"Welcome to Hellmouth\" and \"Harvest,\" introduces Buffy and audiences to  her new high school, her friends, and her enemies. Most importantly, the episodes introduce a demon who'll plague her through the series' first season: the Master. She also meets Angel, the most beleaguered vampire this side of Lestat's Louis. Together, the newfound friends and the watcher  battle--and win (for now)--against the Master's minions. \"The Witch\" is an early example of the demons Buffy faces--it's not just about staking vamps.  Here Buffy meets Amy (a recurring character), whose mother is a cheerleader-obsessed--you guessed it--witch. \"Never Kill a Boy on the First Date\" explores a recurring theme: Buffy's thwarted attempts for normalcy in her life. As viewers come to expect, demons get in the way. Here, the Anointed One (a kiddie vamp) is crowned. Buffy learns the true identity of the mysterious and handsome Angel, who's spent the last 80 years without a kill. The couple agree not to pursue a relationship (yeah, right). Another episode that explores the demonic is \"The Puppet Show,\" which borrows from the familiar theme of the possessed ventriloquist's dummy. Some episodes are quite graphic (\"The Puppet Show,\" for example, features a potential brain removal), but there's always the inevitable triumph of good over evil. This justifiably popular phenomenon serves up healthy messages of loyalty and friendship, complete with hip, dead-on funny dialogue and great clothes. It's also a celebration of the quirky and the odd(balls).--N.F.

{"description": "An economic crisis brings unemployed Nada (Roddy Piper) to L.A. in search of work.  What he finds instead is that the ruling elite of the world are aliens in disguise, their aim being to keep humans in a state of mindless consumerism.  His discovery comes when he dons a pair of special sunglasses made by a resistance group and sees for the first time reality unadorned.  Billboards, store signs, magazine covers--all bear subliminal messages to OBEY, to CONSUME, to have NO INDEPENDENT THOUGHT.  Money itself says THIS IS YOUR GOD. But worst of all, with these glasses you see which of us are really hideous, bug-eyed aliens.  The conceptual breakthrough is hilarious while keeping its roots in darker matters.  Although some fault the film for settling into its action plot, the ending has a great payoff. And the direction by John Carpenter is handled with superb workmanlike aplomb.

{"description": "What sounds like a high-concept romantic comedy pitch from hell--widower president falls for smart lobbyist while the world watches--is actually intelligent, charming, touching, and quite funny. Granted, it's wish fulfillment all the way (when was the last time you saw a president who wastrulypresidential?), but in the capable hands of writer Aaron Sorkin (TV'sSports Night) and director Rob Reiner,The American Presidentis incredibly enjoyable entertainment with quite a few ideas about both romance and the government. Michael Douglas stars as the president, who after three years in office starts thinking about the possibility of dating. When he auspiciously encounters cutthroat environmental lobbyist Sydney Ellen Wade (Annette Bening), sparks begin to crackle and the two begin a tentative but heartfelt romance. Of course, his job gets in the way--their first kiss is interrupted by a Libyan bombing--but darn it if these two kids aren't going to try and make it work! However, they hadn't counted on the president's Republican antagonist (Richard Dreyfuss), who starts carping about family values. The predictable plot--Douglas finally goes to bat for his lady and his country--is leavened by Sorkin's wonderful, snappy dialogue and a light touch from the usually subtle-as-a-sledgehammer Reiner. Both manage to create a believable White House-office atmosphere (with a crack staff including Martin Sheen, Michael J. Fox, Anna Deavere Smith, and Samantha Mathis) as well as a plausible and funny dating scenario. The true success of the movie, though, rides squarely on Douglas and Bening; this is unequivocally Douglas's best comedic performance (ergo his best performance, period) and Bening, usually such a good bad girl, takes a standard career-woman role and fleshes it out magnificently. You can see in an instant why Douglas would fall for her. One of the best unsung romantic comedies of the '90s.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302928540", "630243078X", "0767809262", "6305126062", "6301796535", "6305657955", "6305368139"], "bought_together": ["6302928540"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 304957}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 0.48, "brand": "", "asin": "6305132666", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/7139F895DDL._SY300_.gif", "title": "The American President [VHS]"}
{"description": "Peter Weir directed this comedy-drama, a commentary on all-pervasive media manipulation. Scripted by Andrew M. Niccol (Gattaca), the film plays like a combination of the British TV series The Prisoner and Paul Bartel's The Secret Cinema. Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey) is unaware that his entire life is a hugely popular 24-hour-a-day TV series. In this real-time documentary, every moment of Truman's existence is captured by concealed cameras and telecast to a giant global audience. His friends and family are actors who smile pleasantly at Truman's familiar catchphrase greeting, \"In case I don't see you later, good afternoon, good evening, and good night!\" Employed at an insurance company, Truman is married to merry Meryl (Laura Linney), and they live in the cheerful community of Seahaven, an island \"paradise\" where the weather is always mild and no unpleasantness intrudes. This is the basic situation of the series, which has grown over the years into a billion-dollar franchise for the TV network. As an unwanted pregnancy, Truman was adopted by the network and raised in the zoolike environment of a TV soundstage. Thus, the TV audience became hooked when Truman was very young. Now, at age 30, he still doesn't know he's a prisoner on an immense domed city-size soundstage, simulating Seahaven. Both the illusion and the ratings will collapse if Truman ever leaves Seahaven. In addition to elaborate events staged to make sure he stays put, Truman is given constant reminders of how wonderful Seahaven is compared to dangers in other parts of the world. However, his growing suspicions make him curious enough to try to leave, and the show's director and master manipulator Christof (Ed Harris) must constantly devise ways to thwart Truman's escape attempts. To enter the harbor, Truman must overcome his fear of water, intentionally instilled in him when his father \"died\" in a boating accident and was written out of the script.", "related": {"also_bought": ["0790731649"], "bought_together": ["0790731649"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 319413}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.0, "brand": "", "asin": "630518299X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GRFF4KA1L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Truman Show [VHS]"}
{"description": "If Clive Barker had written an episode ofThe Twilight Zone, it might have looked something likeCube. A handful of strangers wake up inside a bizarre maze, having been spirited there during the night. They quickly learn that they have to navigate their way through a series of chambers if they have any hope of escape, but the problem is that there are lethal traps awaiting if they choose their route unwisely. Having established some imaginative and grisly punishments in store for the hostages, cowriter and director Vincenzo Natali turns his attention to the characters, for whom being trapped amplifies their best and worst qualities. The film is, in fact, similar to a famous episode of Rod Serling's old television series, though Natali's explanation for why these poor people are being put through hell is a lot closer to the spirit ofThe X-Files.Cubehas some solid moments of suspense and drama, and the sets are appropriately striking: one is tempted to believe at first the characters are lost inside a computer chip.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00008DDVY", "B0006Z2LH4", "B003TRMLQM", "078401213X", "B0040QYRSQ", "B00003CXKM", "B0045HCJSU", "B002TVQ4HG", "B00AEFXW8I", "0783228457", "B000CGX7FW", "B002C6VMKW", "B0051GLDQS", "B007AFC0RY", "B00006AUIG", "B0001US62I", "B00000K3TS", "B00ECW9UJY", "B000AQKV1W", "6305622760", "6305972001", "B00IXD2MWK", "B002QW7ALM", "B000A2X3U2", "B001J4E19C", "B0053TWVIM", "B002EOVXEC", "B0019BI1DM", "B0018O4YT0", "B0056P6SOG", "B0000541TL", "B00006IUFV", "B00BTYOYG2", "B00IKM5MIA", "B008874968", "B004EPZ08O", "B0028DRGDQ", "B003Y5H4SO", "B000MV8ABS", "B00009PY2T", "079073639X", "B004SIP92O", "B002AMVEII", "B00001QGUM", "B00GKOJ98E", "B0007WQHI0", "B00J5LXT6M", "B00008EY9G", "B00003CXUP", "B003EYVXSW", "B00005UQ9W", "B000Y7U98C", "B009DA743Y", "B002E2QH7W", "B000UJ48P4", "B000MNOXZ8", "B00DI012O2", "B009IV2Z3M", "B002TZS5G0", "B001FOPOD8", "B0001EFV7M", "157362618X", "B003Q6D246", "0783116926", "B000A6T1ZY", "B0091G7BTM", "B00000F5WY", "B00009WNXA", "6305718954", "B000OA8OK4", "B004SUDQ72", "B003TRMLM6", "B003VMFWXO", "B002ZG98LO", "B0004Z31OS", "B00JQYV0B4", "B0002CHIKG", "B0009MWELW", "B00006CXGP", "B001MEJY8W", "B008G33PIM", "B00A1AU74I", "B008Y1YK7G", "0767824954", "B0034G4OVS", "B003Q6D27S", "B000AM6OQ2", "B0009G3B0G", "B009XTF8KQ", "B00079Z9X2", "B000RPCK2O", "B000UAE7O0", "B00EZ50SGW", "B000069HZP", "B000I2J68M", "B0037E8HNI", "B000ARFPMQ", "B00BSU0FQA", "B008JFUNYG"], "bought_together": ["B00008DDVY", "B0006Z2LH4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003TRMLQM", "078401213X", "B00008DDVY", "B002EOVXEC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 14077}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.88, "brand": "Trimark Home Video", "asin": "6305238065", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51AJV2DZ45L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Cube"}
{"description": "Angie Dickinson stars as a bank-robbing matriarch in this 1974  Roger Corman production, often described as a knock-off ofBonnie and Clyde. (As if that makes any difference regarding the worth of the film--which is  pretty good.)

{"description": "One of the most endearing and intelligent romantic comedies of the '90s, the Oscar-winningShakespeare in Loveis filled with such good will, sunny romance, snappy one-liners, and devilish cleverness that it's absolutely irresistible. With tongue placed firmly in cheek, at its outset the film tracks young Will Shakespeare's overwrought battle with writer's block and the efforts of theater owner Philip Henslowe (Geoffrey Rush, in rare form) to stage Will's latest comedy,Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter. Jokey comedy, though, soon takes a backseat to ravishing romance when the beautiful Viola De Lesseps (Gwyneth Paltrow) disguises herself as a young man to wangle herself an audition in the all-male cast, and wins both the part of Romeo and, after much misunderstanding, the playwright's heart. Soon enough, Will's pirate comedy becomes the beautiful, tragicRomeo and Juliet, reflecting the agony and ecstasy of Will and Viola's romance--he's married and she's set to marry the slimy Lord Wessex (Colin Firth) in the near future.The way that Oscar-winning screenwriters Marc Norman and Tom Stoppard enfold their story within the parameters ofRomeo and Juliet(and evenTwelfth Night) is nothing short of brilliant--it would take a Shakespearean scholar to dissect the innumerable parallels, oft-quoted lines, plot developments, and thematic borrowings. And most amazingly, Norman and Stoppard haven't forgotten to entertain their audience in addition to riding a Shakespearean roller coaster, with director John Madden (Mrs. Brown) reigning in his huge ensemble with rollicking energy. Along the way there are small gems to be found, including Judi Dench's eight-minute, Oscar-winning turn as atrulyregal Queen Elizabeth, but the key element ofShakespeare in Love's success rests on the milky-white shoulders of its two stars. Fiennes, inexplicably overlooked at Oscar time, is a dashing, heartfelt Will, and as for Best Actress winner Paltrow, well, nothing she'd done before could have prepared viewers for how amazing she is here. Breathtakingly beautiful, fiercely intelligent, strong-willed, and lovestruck--it's a performance worthy of Shakespeare in more ways than one. By the film's end, you'll be thoroughly won over--and brushing up your Shakespeare with newfound ardor.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["0790734060", "6304071876"], "also_viewed": ["B00006FN65"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 406033}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.72, "brand": "", "asin": "6305470448", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Q5DABSM6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Shakespeare in Love [VHS]"}

{"description": "Matthew Broderick makes up for years of wet-noodle performances with his low-key but unsparing characterization of Jim McAllister, a high school teacher at George Washington Carver High School in Omaha, Nebraska. Driven by a strange mixture of loathing and lust for pathologically overachieving student Tracy Flick (Reese Witherspoon), McAllister encourages a dim but popular athlete, Paul (Chris Klein fromAmerican Pie), to run against her in the election for student-council president. Director-cowriter Alexander Payne (Citizen Ruth) turns this deceptively simple premise into a complex and scathing comedy of ambition, corruption, and desire, all at its most naked and petty. Every scene contains some painfully funny nuance that will make you wince in a mixture of astonishment and empathy. Witherspoon flips effortlessly back and forth from adolescent vulnerability to steely-eyed strength; she's becoming a contemporary Carole Lombard. The movie itself feels like a magnificent throwback to the richly layered comedies of the '30s, which drew their humor from sharply drawn characters and twisting plots instead of explosions of bodily fluids.

Not much is different here:  hardcore fans will love it, while critics will still be shaking their heads in  disbelief.--Dave McCoy", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 236248}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "title": "WWF: Fully Loaded 2000 [VHS]", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305710481", "6305710376", "6305710503", "6304826206", "B000055ZK6", "B00001W9GL", "B000055ZK8", "6305710449", "6305565724", "B00004YRWU", "B000055ZKB", "6305958637", "6305013861", "B000031VPQ", "B000055ZK4", "B00120LPO2", "B000055ZK5", "B000N2HDEQ", "B00120LPOC", "B00120LPNI", "B000LC3ILU", "B00005NRO5", "B000LC3IJM", "B000H6SXVU", "B000KHX70I", "B001KKU9D2", "B00120LPME", "B000EHQ86O", "B00000J11L", "B00120LPMO", "B0010X7428", "B000GTLR20", "B000EXZKSK", "B00120LPMY", "B00005KH1N", "B000H6SXWE", "B000A2SZGO", "B00005Q4EU", "B00004YRWV", "6305347085", "B000067J4L", "B0055CP9KO", "B00009W0VU", "B00B361FKY", "B000067J4J", "6305491313", "6305015074", "B003G7165C", "6305229198", "B00005AAAJ", "6305255261", "B000087F5G", "B000ES14I0", "B00005RJ3L", "6304277504", "B00005RIYO", "B000055ZKA", "6304824424", "6305205264", "B004PHE9G0", "6305255229", "6305085471", "B0000AGQ53", "B000055ZKD", "B00005O5NG", "B001H5X6PS", "B00004VVNN", "B000055ZKC", "B001I1KLJA", "B00007M5KB", "B0006SSNVO", "B002VWNIF4", "B00006SFM8", "B00028G6RQ", "6305277060", "B00028G6R6", "6305255210", "B002436WHQ", "B004SNN9TE", "6301910907", "B000EQ5VJU", "B001UDS4CW", "B000056PNM", "B003ULW770", "B002K0WBVY", "B00028G6T4", "B002436WIA", "B000WMFZLU", "B00284G2CQ"], "also_viewed": ["6305710481", "6305710503", "6305710376", "B000055ZK6", "B00004YRWU", "6305013861", "6305565724", "6304826206", "B000068QOI", "B00005Q4EU", "B000A2SZGO", "B00004YRWV", "B00KV17WE0", "6305347085", "6305085471", "B00005NRO5", "B00005AAAJ", "6305255229", "B000056PNM", "6305994781", "B00006LPHG", "B000031VPQ", "B00005QAQJ", "6302999413", "6304826214", "6305604053", "6301556941", "B00007M5KB", "B000087F5G", "B00007ELG5", "B00005RIYI", "B00124ONF6", "B00005Q4EV", "B000055ZK8", "B00005KH1M", "B00ESZZOBS", "B00001W9GL", "B000089777", "B00004VVNN", "6305710449", "B00006SFM8", "B00HRUQA8C", "B000055ZK4", "B008WAM2PQ", "6305958637", "B00005KHKF", "B00005O5DO", "6305255210", "B00005RIYM", "6305229198", "B0001BYYAA"]}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/417Q3EAH43L._SY300_.jpg", "asin": "6305710465"}

{"description": "Generally acknowledged as a bona fide classic, this Francis Ford Coppola film is one of those rare experiences that feels perfectly right from beginning to end--almost as if everyone involved had been born to participate in it. Based on Mario Puzo's bestselling novel about a Mafia dynasty, Coppola'sGodfatherextracted and enhanced the most universal themes of immigrant experience in America: the plotting-out of hopes and dreams for one's successors, the raising of children to carry on the good work, etc. In the midst of generational strife during the Vietnam years, the film somehow struck a chord with a nation fascinated by the metamorphosis of a rebellious son (Al Pacino) into the keeper of his father's dream. Marlon Brando played against Puzo's own conception of patriarch Vito Corleone, and time has certainly proven the actor correct. The rest of the cast, particularly James Caan, John Cazale, and Robert Duvall as the rest of Vito's male brood--all coping with how to take the mantle of responsibility from their father--is seamless and wonderful.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["630021639X", "6302158176", "6300183211", "6304214502", "6300214826", "0790705141", "6303168507", "0790733927", "B00003CXE6", "630470786X", "6300267997", "0790741512", "6303471501", "6300271331", "6302054982", "6303686796", "B00005PJ8I", "B00004COR2", "0792842111", "6304258984", "6304509146", "0783216084", "6300215644", "6300216500", "B000062XM6", "0800199421", "B0002F6BQU", "0800116917", "630336568X", "6304508611", "B00000F13T", "6304935811", "6305363668", "B000005PFL", "6300182878", "0792116887", "6300182452", "B00005B238", "0792845684", "6300247171", "0792839846", "6302482712", "6302989787", "0790732017", "0800100832", "630442972X", "6304196954", "B000065U6Q", "6301208773", "B00000K2SC", "6302842263", "6304429274", "6303313345", "B0000A36J1", "B000059XY5", "079212569X"], "bought_together": ["630021639X", "6302158176"], "also_viewed": ["6302610702", "630021639X", "6301792734", "6303402348", "6300215830", "6304117752", "6300183211", "6302158176", "B00COYZF5A", "6300214060", "B000NTPDSW", "6305095566", "0792151712", "6305169187", "6303953425", "080010367X", "6302054982", "6301208773", "B000KX0ISG", "630310696X", "6302415853", "6304214502", "B00005B238", "6303168507", "B00E9PMMX0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 270877}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.98, "brand": "", "asin": "B000003KHS", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/11KQ3QC757L.jpg", "title": "The Godfather [VHS]"}

{"description": "EDITOR'S NOTE: According to a Warner Home Video technician involved in  the production ofThe Stanley Kubrick Collection, Kubrick authorized all aspects of theCollection, from the use of Digital Component Video (or \"D-1\") masters originally approved in 1989, to the use of minimalist screen menus, chapter stops, and (in the case of2001: A Space OdysseyandThe Shiningon DVD) supplementary materials. Full-screen presentation ofThe ShiningandFull Metal Jacketwas also approved by Kubrick, who recomposed his original framing,  reportedly believing that those films looked best on video in the full-screen format. (In fact, the original theatrical aspect ratio ofThe Shiningwas 1.66:1, meaning that a relatively small portion of the image is lost.) Kubrick also chose mono over stereo,  believing that inconsistencies in theatrical sound systems resulted in loss of control over theatrical presentation. In every respect, the Warner spokesman  said, the films in theCollectionremain as Kubrick approved them. Any future attempt to remaster or alter them would  have to be approved by an appointee of the Kubrick estate.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00366F2NU", "B000UJ48SQ", "0792841409", "B005152C9G", "B000055Y0X", "B0013D8LKO", "0783226039", "B004L9GMBC", "B00005ATQB", "0792841387", "B007K8ILTW", "B000P0J09C", "B0000AUHQ6", "B000063JDE", "B002VWNIDG", "B001IHJ988", "B000EBD9TE", "B000EBD9SU", "B000UJCAKY", "B001FOK70S", "0679727299", "B00005JKJA", "B00004TWZH", "B00006RCNV", "B001LXIDUY", "0679723161", "6305999872", "B0087ZG7OI", "B00DW5IKYS", "B008RO875Q", "B0045HCJ94", "B0013FSXT6", "B00005JKGX", "B00AEBB89C", "B0087ZG7UW", "0767830555", "B0020LH8WU", "B0050FXDDQ", "B0057UA486", "B0045HCJ8U", "B000UJCAKO", "B0009S4J3M", "B0041KKYEM", "B001152TL6", "B00009W5CA", "B00C3ALLDA", "B00AEFXN9G", "B001FZQOW2", "B00000IREA", "B0000DJZ8Q", "B00005U2KC", "B0087ZG7R0", "B0010AN7Z4", "B007Y1NR1W", "B005Z9MGRG", "B00005QAPH", "B008BFSMBA", "B004NWPY20", "B00003CXBU", "B00AEFXESQ", "B007Y1NNAW", "B00079Z9VO", "B00K8HAIAW", "B003ELKNH2", "B0082CWTSY", "B001TIQT70", "B00062IVM6", "B005KQVE1S", "0783230559", "B0000549B1", "B000CNESU8", "B00004XPPK", "B00008RH3J", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B000QQFKYE", "B000EXDSCA", "B00AEFYSEA", "B00009MEKJ", "B000VLCRCW", "B002VWNICC", "B003VA3JTK", "B0045HCJ9O", "B00003CXCF", "078323502X", "B0010YVCI4", "B00BTYU3SK", "B00006ADD5", "B002LYD2MG", "B006TTC5HC", "B0009A40ES", "B00026L8US", "B008MIMWP8", "B0000DI87S", "B003O7I6SE", "B009POCG0Y", "B00000CQJZ", "B000G8NXYG", "B001PYD0LG", "6304907729"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00366F2NU", "B000UJ48SQ", "B0013D8LKO", "B000UJ48T0"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 158378}, "asin": "B00000J2KV", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/714ZK0VSVBL._SY300_.gif", "title": "Lolita"}
{"description": "The continuing adventures of the starshipEnterprise, as recorded for  posterity on  DVD, move into their sixth volume with a very interesting pair of shows from  the original series. \"Miri,\" one of the most popular episodes, featured a couple  of soon-to-be-semi-icons from two very different  kinds of films from the late 1960s: Michael&nbsp;J. Pollard (who would appear inBonnie and Clyde) and Kim Darby (John Wayne's costar inTrue  Grit). The intriguing story concerns a race of children on an Earth-like  planet who are in fact 300&nbsp;years old, kept pristine in the summer of their  lives by a disease that also causes madness and death with the onset of adulthood. TheEnterprise's  landing party, including Captain Kirk (William Shatner), Mr.&nbsp;Spock  (Leonard Nimoy), and Dr.&nbsp;McCoy (DeForest Kelley), are instantly contaminated  and forced to remain on the planet until McCoy can find an antidote. In the meantime, Darby's character, Miri, falls for Kirk and becomes jealous of his  attentions toward anyone else. Easily one ofStar Trek's strongest  shows, \"Miri\" is a must-see for Trekkers and Trekkies.Also on this disk is \"The Conscience of the King,\" a memorable drama about a  traveling Shakespearean troupe led by one Anton Karidian (Arnold Moss), who may or may not be the same man as Kodos the Executioner, former governor of a  Federation planet who oversaw the mass murder of thousands of people rather than watch them starve to death during a food shortage. (Shortly after the  deaths, Federation supply ships arrived and Kodos disappeared, right around the time that Karidian arrived as a classical actor touring the planets.) A nice twist: among victims of Kodos's wrongheaded mercy killings were  relatives of Captain Kirk (William Shatner), adding a personal note to the  mystery of Karidian/Kodos.

Two hard-boiled career petty officers, Buddusky (Nicholson) and Mulhall (Otis Young), aredetailed to take a young sailor, Meadows (Randy Quaid), from a Virginia Naval Base to a New Hampshire Naval Prison to serve an eight-year sentence for a trivial offense. Buddusky and Mulhall take a liking to Meadows and are determined to show him a good time on their journey north. Their escapades begin in Washington where they narrowly escape a bar fight, then get blind drunk in their hotel room. In New York, they tangle with some Marines, and in Boston, Buddusky takes Meadows to a brothel forhis first sexual experience. Finally, after reluctantly turning in Meadows, Buddusky and Mulhall realize they are as much prisoners of their own world as Meadows now is of his.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000LC4ZBW", "B00002VWE0", "B001EKP5D2", "B0001FGBW0", "B00009Y3PV", "B00004REAG", "B00AEFXN9G", "B000E33W0I", "0767827902", "B000B6CO48", "B003B3NV6S", "B00AEFY5GQ", "0792843568", "B00K6D1S7A", "B00005BCKG", "B000ANVPSS", "B00005V9HI", "B000BZISVM", "B004FQX5B6", "0792833287", "B004SUDPZA", "B0006GANN2", "B00005U2KC", "B00K72HVBC", "B001IHJ988", "B000286RP2", "B008XAT0TQ", "B001TIQT6G", "B003VA3JTA", "B000O78L00", "6305132917", "079073219X", "B00005V9HM", "B00K6D1QOA", "B00BTYU3SK", "B00K6D1QBI", "B000MGTQ7K", "B00AEBB9N2", "B00005M2CO", "B005KQVE1S", "B000022TSY", "B003O7I6SE", "B00JVQ7PWU", "B0001GF2JC", "B00005JLSK", "B00AEBB9AK", "6305882592", "B00AEBB95K", "B0045HCIZE", "B0001NBMH6", "B00006RCNV", "B0009GX1CE", "B000GG4Y32", "B000B7QCRW", "B0009X75O2", "B000FFJYBG", "B00013RC2U", "B0002HOER6", "B00005JH9B", "B00005QCVU", "B00K6D1S8O", "B000063K2Q", "B0000AMRUP", "B000056HEF", "B0002JP2OS", "B00008O38F", "B000CNESU8", "B000FZETR0", "B00005B6JZ", "B00441GYR4", "B00IMRL2AA", "B0010AN7Z4", "B0028OH568", "B0006GAOJA", "B00079Z9VO", "B000EHSVR8", "B000BC8SWE", "B00DW5IKW0", "B00005PJ6T", "B00F98FOI6", "B0001GH5TW", "B00005EBSF", "B00005LC4D", "B00092ZLEY", "B00I4X8KU2", "B00AQ6J5JU", "B0004Z33E6", "B0024HH32A", "B00IQHPS6A", "B00005O06L", "B0007TKNGK", "B00JAQJNN0", "B00023P4N8", "B00B27WTOK", "B000063US3", "B00IKM5OYW", "B000CNESN0", "B003ASLJNQ", "B001JNNDLU"], "bought_together": ["B000LC4ZBW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B008XAT0TQ", "0767827902", "B00002VWE0", "B0001FGBW0"]}, "price": 12.86, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 28330}, "asin": "B000022TS6", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5148JSKA8EL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Last Detail"}

{"description": "Billy Crystal plays Mickey, a basketball referee who has to accompany  his estranged father's body to France, where the old man requested to be buried with the other members of his D-Day platoon. Unfortunately for Mickey, the airline loses his body. Fortunately for Mickey, this leads him to meet Ellen (Debra Winger), an airline executive who takes personal charge of the case and even joins him at the funeral. A whirlwind Paris romance leads to marriage, but that's when the complications begin... The story of Mickey and Ellen's marriage is recounted by their friends (played by Joe Mantegna, Cynthia Stevenson, Julie Kavner, Richard Masur, John Spencer, and Cathy Moriarty) as they wait for Mickey and Ellen to arrive at a dinner party. And of course these friends have their own stories, which are played out in witty shorthand as they bicker about who's going to tell the next part of the Mickey/Ellen saga.Forget Parisis uneven (unsurprisingly, Winger is stronger in the dramatic sections and Crystal in the comic parts, a schism that takes its toll on their chemistry), but its best parts hold up, even if the whole is shaky. Plus, the movie's theme (that romantic memories aren't what makes a marriage work, you have to live in the present) is explored with conviction and tenderness.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00008G7UF", "B000XJD33O", "B000063JDN", "B00008972Y", "6304584210", "B00158K0QU", "B000002HJL", "B001DB6J6Y", "B00005N89R", "0790742071", "B009SH5JS4", "B005MYEQ4U", "B0000A2ZO0", "B00009Y3PV", "6304907729", "B00006ZXSO", "B0062VL500", "B0045HCJ76", "B004SIP9RO", "B0000542C9", "B000YDBPAM", "6304765266", "B00008DDXA", "0792842162", "B0000AOV4I", "0790742454", "B000H5TH1Q", "B00BEIYGK2", "B000JYW5B4", "B00006ZXSN", "B00AEFYD2M", "B0045HCJGW", "B00441GYRO", "B000MRNWK6", "B000BNX3B4", "B00005JG6N", "B00009AOAZ", "B0045HCIYU", "6305692572", "0767811100", "0790732149", "B002U4UYZA", "B00441GYZQ", "B000ZM1MG4", "B00003CXP7", "B000EHRVOW", "B00AEBB8YW", "B00AYRIUOC", "B00005JNQA", "B000228EGS", "B002NZK5RI", "B0021L8UZS", "B000EOTW0Q", "B00008979P", "B00006ZXSL", "B00008AOWI", "0767802535", "B0038N9X3Q", "B00G15MDI0", "B00441GYPG", "B00AEFXIIW", "B0018BZEOC", "B000LXHK2C", "B000085OY1", "B000055Y0Y", "B00AEFXYOA", "B00003CXHG", "B003BZ58RQ", "B00005JL6I", "B00386EZKE", "B00020HAXI", "0792838068", "B00AZMFO6I", "B00AEBB97S", "B000RETOGU", "B00BN3DUVE", "B001ECDVK4", "B002ZG98FU", "B0038N9WKU", "B00709GTGS", "B002AT8K9W", "B00AEFXXMI", "B0016P8OAG", "B00005Y1UV", "0767810856", "B0068FZ0GK", "B0002US528", "B00441GYOM", "0783226772", "B000765IJK", "B000CCW2P2", "B00AEFY66U", "B0007OCG56", "B002LE8MGW", "B004SUDQ2W", "6305213283", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00000JGHK", "B00006FMUW", "B0033PSHDG"], "bought_together": ["B00008G7UF"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000U1ZV80", "B000HT389Y", "B000XJD33O", "B00008G7UF"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 47737}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 23.99, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00002ND79", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41R009YANBL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Forget Paris"}
{"description": "A confident hybrid ofM*A*S*H,Treasure of the Sierra Madre, andDr. Strangelove,Three Kingsis one of the most seriously funny war movies ever made. Improving the premise ofKelly's Heroeswith scathing intelligence, it explores the odd connection between war and consumerism in the age of Humvees and cellular phones. Writer-director David O.&nbsp;Russell's third film (afterSpanking the MonkeyandFlirting with Disaster), it's a no-holds-barred portrait of personal conscience in the volatile arena of politics, played out by one of the most gifted filmmakers to emerge in the 1990s.George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg, Ice Cube, and Spike Jonze (director ofBeing John Malkovich) play a quartet of U.S.&nbsp;soldiers who, disillusioned by Operation Desert Storm, decide to steal $23&nbsp;million in gold hijacked from Kuwait by Saddam Hussein's army. Getting the bullion out of an Iraqi stronghold is easy; keeping it is a potentially lethal proposition. By the end of their mercenary mission, the Americans can no longer ignore wartime atrocities (and neither can we--the film is boldly unflinching), and conscience demands their aid to Kuwaiti rebels abandoned by President George Bush's fickle wartime policy. This is serious stuff indeed, but Russell infusesThree Kingswith a keen sense of the absurd, and the entire film is an exercise in breathtaking visual ingenuity. Despite a conventional ending that's mildly disappointing for such a brashly original film,Three Kingsconveys the brutal madness of war while making you laugh out loud at the insanity.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B00DON8NJ0", "B000IYV1ME", "B000O7667K", "B000H1RFKU", "B003ASLJOK", "B000JU7KAE", "B001G8XOMG", "B00DON4TPC", "B001O7JHSO", "B0046BHC6O", "B0021L8URQ", "B001XURJCS", "B001CT877G", "B0013FSXT6", "B002ZG97QU", "B0047BXR1W", "B001HN69CC", "B000JLPMPI", "B000HLDFK4", "B000TGGJKU", "B003L7DK60", "B001AQT0RC", "B001J6NZGU", "B0011VIODW", "B000Q7ZND6", "B000P6XU60", "B000H1RFKK", "B001FB55M6", "B0017TYPIG", "B000O176IO", "B0011E5D2Y", "B000KF0NI4", "B000Q6GX90", "B000LPS4BG", "B000M5AJQI", "B000JUB7LW", "B0015GDVTU", "B000UJ48UO", "B002Z7FM68", "B000I5XOWI", "B000MEYFXW", "B0012YYZYK", "B000PC0U1W", "B003YOZNBK", "B001NCDCQ8", "B000JLSLZQ", "B000R3PDK2", "B001FB55H6", "B0010HOZXA", "B003B1X80Y", "B000JLSM00", "B001O7JHW0", "B006H3MIYA", "B000MQ54OY", "B003UESJHY", "B000Q66J1M", "B006OQ0K0E", "B003TT2X6S", "B001OQCUZW", "B003TT2X6I"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B006H3MIYA", "B002T9H2L0", "B003KGBIS4", "B00HF98SY4"]}, "price": 8.5, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 1098395}, "asin": "B00003CX73", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51BA5ATJSYL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Three Kings"}

The goofy plot's only half the fun; with  roles for Stiller's parents (Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara), dozens of  celebrity cameos, endlessly quotable dialogue, and improvisational  energy to spare,Zoolanderis very smart about being very stupid, easily matching theAustin Powersfranchise for inspired comedic lunacy.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEFXJS6", "B00AEBB8FQ", "B0009HBPN0", "B00005JMYI", "B00AEFYPXY", "B000J4P9P8", "B00AEFYS2M", "B0016MOV92", "B000BKJ762", "B000BKVQS4", "B0006GANPA", "B00AEBBA2C", "B001G5T6GW", "B00AEBB9GY", "B00024JC4E", "B008220BGQ", "B00005JMW7", "B002Q4VBPQ", "B000WZEZGI", "B001J9KJ4I", "B001DPHDB0", "B008R65XTC", "B000035Z38", "B002ZG99H2", "B00005JKMN", "B000AP04L0", "B000A7DVR2", "B000ELJAEM", "B00466HN7M", "B00003CXO1", "B0000AKCKI", "B000089778", "B0083XXVFW", "6305161860", "B000M341QE", "B008R65XNS", "B000ADWDE8", "B002BIULKS", "B00AEFYM2S", "B002WY65VU", "B00AEFY854", "B008R65XUQ", "B00AEFZ8OY", "B0007DFJ0G", "B000G6BLW4", "B00AEFXO8Q", "B00004TJMW", "B00AEFY0F2", "B003CRM6PA", "B000XPU66U", "B003Y5H4ZW", "B00AEFXIUK", "B002ZG98B4", "B000HT386M", "B000085EFK", "B00287Z18Y", "B003VPX5Y4", "B002O3Z4YI", "B001UV4X8S", "B008JFUORW", "B0000AC8LR", "630529142X", "B00AEBB9DM", "B003Y5H5B0", "B004EPZ084", "B00005O3VC", "0800195175", "B0001Z4OXS", "B0000A02TZ", "B000Z8GZYW", "B002ZG980U", "B00AEFXXMI", "B00CE00ZV8", "B0074FURNE", "B004H83IM8", "B00005JL93", "B0036TGSIK", "B002T9H2LA", "B002P7UCJ0", "B001GZ6QC4", "B00003CXPS", "B00AEBBA2M", "B001OD4S50", "B0002F6BRE", "B00014NE9E", "B000FS9FCG", "B0019HQICW", "B003TY2SPO", "B00005JM20", "B004SIP7ZS", "B00068WOH8", "B00005OCJP", "B000MMMT9G", "B0018CNNV2", "B00004Z4WR", "B000P0J09M", "B00011CZRE", "B0009A40ES", "B000IZJZIU", "B001AGXEAG"], "bought_together": ["B00AEBB8FQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AMSNED0", "B00AEFYPXY", "B004EPZ084", "B00AEFYS2M"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 80747}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.82, "brand": "Paramount", "asin": "B00003CXPJ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51BF60YQ17L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Zoolander (Special Collector's Edition)"}

{"description": "In the first season ofThe X-Files, creator Chris Carter was uncertain of the series' future, so each of the episodes is a self-contained suspense story; they do not delve deep into the ongoing X-Files mythology or turn to self-parody and humor as do episodes in later seasons. Yet, these episodes display the elements for which the show would become famous: the cinematic production values and top-notch special effects, the stark lighting of the Vancouver sets, the atmospheric halo of Mark Snow's score, and the clever plots dealing with subjects ranging from the occult, religion, and monsters to urban legends, conspiracy theories, and science fiction. Most importantly, season&nbsp;1 introduces FBI agents Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and Fox \"Spooky\" Mulder (David Duchovny), two of the most attractive government officials around. Scully is the serious-minded medical scientist assigned to join Mulder on the X-Files, a division of the FBI dealing with the paranormal. Mulder is the intuitive thinker with a dry wit, a passionate believer in the existence of paranormal phenomena and one of the few characters on television smart enough to figure out who the bad guy is before the audience does. Their muddled relationship, a deep friendship laced with sexual tension, provides the human heart in a world where the bizarre and horrible lurk in everyday society.The materials on the bonus disc provide some interesting trivia and background, but it is the 24 episodes themselves that make this seven-disc boxed set a true find. Those unfamiliar withThe X-Filesoften view all the fuss with the same skepticism with which Scully first regards her new partner's ideas. But just as she comes to realize the uncanny accuracy of Mulder's outlandish theories, newcomers toThe X-Fileswho sample a few episodes in this boxed set will likely find themselves riveted to their television late into the night. And undoubtedly, the shadows and creaking noises in the house that evening will seem more menacing than usual.--Eugene Wei", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000BOH98G", "B000BOH990", "B000CNE0SS", "B000CNE0T2", "B000CNE0TC", "B000EXDS34", "B000EXDS3E", "B000EXDS3Y", "B0007X7044", "B001G7PSZI", "B001FACH7S", "B0006UEVUE", "B001CY5N00", "B00005JA9M", "B0007ZEO7I", "B000002N3A", "B00CRVL5ZE", "B002GP7ZVY", "B00FXW9664", "B002GP7ZVO", "B000083C6V", "B00003CXIS", "B001G7PSSK", "B003V1IU3O", "B000ATQYWY", "B004X60QE2", "B000244E2O", "B0030E5PYO", "B002GP7ZV4", "B000NDEXK2", "B002ZCY872", "0792839056", "B0012CJQYG", "B0002I848K", "B000EBGFPY", "B000UX6THK", "B001C4CI8U", "B00BTYNXJG", "B00005JNOG", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B006BZ8NSE", "B00GTZWZH6", "B00465I156", "B000R7GKQE", "B0002PYS7Y", "B000F8O2Q0", "B000F8O2PQ", "B00466H3CW", "B0009X76XW", "B001T21R5U", "B00005Y1NF", "B000AQ68Z0", "B001BSBBGC", "B000063V8R", "B000BGR1B4", "B007C8RZQ0", "B002BWP2IK", "B0058JEHTS", "B002GP7ZW8", "B000667HBS", "B00DNUSFZQ", "B00CDAG0WW", "B00AEBB9AK", "B000FOPPBA", "B000056T4I", "B001FB4W0C", "B001KOFH2G", "B002JVWRAO", "B0009NZ2RE", "B004QOB8TS", "B000AJJNI6", "B0002ERWVE", "B00BM2JVAA", "0790742012", "B000VDDDY6", "B000F8O2OW", "B00HR2HTRQ", "B004YM6JI2", "B00005JNEQ", "B00003CXZ4", "B000FJH5M2", "B001MVWRNE", "0783225725", "B000EXDS7K", "B00019074O", "B000JLTRHW", "B003BNO9GO", "B001G0MFIS", "B0032JTV6A", "B000FIMG68", "B004LROMWU", "B00008972G", "B001DMVZJ4", "B0011UF79M", "B005FISBTO", "B001715A92", "B000P6YNSE", "B00009PY45", "B00BYNL8DU", "B008B4KVRE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00CRVL5ZE", "B000BOH990", "B000BOH98G", "B0007X7044"]}, "price": 1.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 170142}, "asin": "B00003RQND", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51G8JY0Q71L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The X-Files - The Complete First Season"}

{"description": "Don't Tell Mom The Babysitter's Deadaspires to be a cross  betweenHome AloneandRisky Business, with Christina Applegate as an inadvertent scam artist who gets in over her head and somehow pulls it off. When her mother goes to Australia for two months, Sue Ellen (Applegate) thinks she's going to be in charge--until an elderly tyrant of a babysitter arrives. But on the very first night the old lady has a heart attack and keels over. Sue Ellen and her siblings leave the body at a mortuary, only to discover afterward that all the money their mother had left for the summer was in the babysitter's clothes. So Sue Ellen has to get a job. Thanks to a trumped-up resume, she ends up as an executive assistant at a clothing manufacturer. For a while she keeps her head above water by skillfully exploiting a friendly coworker, but her brothers and sisters are running amok at home and a venomous receptionist has it in for her at work. The role-reversal humor of Sue Ellen having to mother her siblings is unsurprising, but Applegate is unexpectedly appealing; her scenes with Josh Charles (Dead Poet's Society,Threesome) have a sweet chemistry. Joanna Cassidy (Blade Runner,The Laughing Policeman) plays Sue Ellen's boss and a young David Duchovny (The X-Files,The Rapture) is a weaselly clerk.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305428050", "B0000897DW", "6305433925", "B00094ARJ6", "B00002SSKI", "B00DW5IL92", "B000065V3H", "B0001AW14C", "B00AEFXPG2", "B005QX8UEE", "B0001EFTSS", "B0012RWQJ8", "B00013WWT8", "6305428549", "B00015YVD6", "B00AEBB9DW", "B000A0GXF6", "B0053TWVR8", "6305428425", "6305236569", "B000065V42", "B000PMFS0A", "B000089778", "B0006J28MI", "B001BPVB5G", "B004RA7YU8", "B000089771", "B000HD1482", "B0000WN0UU", "0783225482", "B00008L3VZ", "B005LL817W", "B00008L3T3", "B002GOAH10", "B00005QT9P", "B00AEBB9E6", "B0045HCJRG", "B001AEF6BS", "B005OK0YVG", "B000BYA4JM", "B00D2UMHVK", "B0000542C7", "B000068TPB", "B00AEFXO8Q", "0800177991", "B000P0J0A6", "B000068MC1", "B000Y11B7Q", "0783227388", "B0001I562I", "B00AEFXXMI", "B000K7VHTQ", "B00005PJ6N", "B0080BFWAE", "B001AEF6C2", "B0000C3I99", "B000P0J09W", "B000260NTK", "B003156II4", "B00008L3W3", "B008R65XTC", "B00008977A", "B00009PY3X", "B001CK1D44", "B001AGXEAG", "B000VDDDW8", "B00008978R", "B00BTYSIWI", "B00008979O", "B00AG473GE", "B00AEBB91E", "B000QQLVPQ", "B0053TWVQ4", "B002GHHHOM", "B000059H76", "B001LMAK9C", "B003ASXMTA", "B00005QCVN", "B000065V43", "B001MWUWU8", "0783225504", "B000068QPT", "B00AGKHBQK", "B00447L4KA", "B00005T7I1", "B00029RTCG", "B00005JLFA", "B0064SVO9I", "B000FFJYBG", "B00AMDA2O4", "B00008G7UG", "0767821637", "B00007AJE1", "B00441GYVK", "B00079Z9Y6", "B00005JG6M", "B000RW3VCU", "B00006JMQ3", "B002JOUNE8", "B00AEBB9IM"], "buy_after_viewing": ["6305428050", "B00002SSKI", "B00DW5IL92", "B00AEBB9E6"]}, "price": 4.27, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 168827}, "asin": "B00004XMVA", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51qgH7FV6BL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Don't Tell Mom The Babysitter's Dead"}
{"description": "The four-episodeSamurai Xoriginal animation video captures the mixture of swordplay and poetry that makes Japanese warrior culture so intriguing to viewers on both sides of the Pacific. The OAV series serves as a prequel to bothSamurai X: The Movieand the more lighthearted TV series. The action unfolds in 1864, when a few clans began the revolt that would overthrow the military dictatorship of the Tokugawa Shogunate and return power to the Emperor in the Meiji Restoration of 1868. Shinta, a lonely orphan, is transformed by master swordsman Hiko into Kenshin Himura, an assassin in the service of Katsuga, one of the revolutionary leaders. Kenshin kills whomever Katsuga orders with consummate skill and unshatterable calm. He believes he is using his sword to bring about a better world, even as the intrigues and counter-intrigues escalate. But he becomes aware of unspoken doubts when he meets Tomoe, a mysterious girl whose beauty, like the iris, is seen to best advantage in cloudy weather. Director Kazuhiro Furuhashi choreographs the sword fights with a grace that infuses even scenes of extreme violence with an elegant sensuality: in one striking image, he focuses on the rain washing a spatter of blood from Tomoe's cheek.

{"description": "With the runaway international acclaim of this film, Taiwanese director Edward Yang could no longer be called Asian cinema's best-kept secret. Yi Yi swiftly follows a middle-class family in Taipei over the course of one year, beginning with a wedding and ending with a funeral.

{"description": "Father Tedis one of those rare sitcoms that defies categorization--it owes as much to Flann O'Brien and Samuel Beckett as it does to Monty Python--and its blend of satire, character comedy, and anarchic surrealism has made it a cult favorite around the world.Exiled to remote Craggy Island, Father Ted Crilley shares a house with the breathtakingly stupid Father Dougal and the constantly inebriated Father Jack, who has a small vocabulary and a taste for furniture polish. Their housekeeper, Mrs. Doyle, takes care of them with a never-ending supply of tea and sandwiches: \"Go on now, Father, won't you try one? They're diagonal.\" Together they fight boredom by dressing up as Elvis, startling ducks at the fair, and provoking nuns.This DVD contains the entire first season ofFather Ted--six episodes of inspired lunacy including a visit from the excruciatingly dull Father Stone, Mrs. Doyle's solemn recitation of all the bad language in Ted's favorite novel, and the death and resurrection of Father Jack. Packed with great lines and hilarious characters,Father Tedgets better with every viewing.--Simon Leake", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005U8PZ", "B0000796CV", "B0000ALPJL", "B0000DZSYC", "B000EOTUTE", "B002LFPAUC", "B0009FVS8Y", "B002BIULNA", "B0000DZSYB", "B001R3YRGC", "B00BQXTCVS", "B0013XZ6TI", "B000NHG7G6", "B0000ALPJN", "B00D7AM2WO", "B0000A02YG", "B001V7UXG2", "B000BVM1SW", "B00078XGRY", "B002BIULNK", "B0000ALPJM", "B003TY2STU", "B00005V1WP", "B000F7CMSG", "B0006FO5MI", "B0009UZG78", "B000EHQU12", "B0000DZSYD", "B0035JHYQG", "B0009NSCTY", "B001JV5BBC", "B000YIGNKY", "B0002F6BT2", "B0002HOERQ", "B004AV5H3U", "B000068UE9", "B000HC2LXU", "B00HYZ10RQ", "B0000TG49C", "B000GH3PNQ", "B00GAHJO8G", "B000TSTEPK", "B000U1ZV9E", "B000N8UXYC", "B000ION2H6", "B000BPL2EW", "B000AOEMVE", "B0000A02Y9", "B000H5U5MQ", "B004ZJHSYS", "B0000A02Y8", "B00007AP31", "B0001JXP8E", "B0007QS28E", "B00003CX8N", "B002BAW6FE", "B000SINSX0", "B000O7860A", "B00006AUL2"], "bought_together": ["B002LFPAUC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000YIGNKY", "B00005U8PZ", "B0000TWMXY", "B00GD7UO4G"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 35099}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 70.0, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00005A1SY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51715RBCBKL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Father Ted - Complete Series 1"}
{"description": "A smart and savvy (albeit highly stylized) look at the single lives of four thirtysomething Manhattan women,Sex and the City: The Complete Second Seasonbuilds on the foundation of its first season with plot arcs that are both hilarious and heartfelt, taking the show from breakout hit to true pop-culture phenomenon. Relationship epiphanies coexist happily alongside farcical plots and zingy one-liners, resulting in emotionally satisfying episodes that feature the sharp kind of character-defining dialogue that seems to have disappeared from the rest of TV long ago. When last we left the NYC gals, Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) had just broken up with a commitment-phobic Mr. Big (Chris Noth), but fans of Noth's seductive-yet-distant rake didn't have to wait long until he was back in the picture, as he and Carrie tried to make another go of it. Their relationship evolution, from reunion to second breakup, provides the core of the second season. The fittingly titled and keenly observed episode \"Evolution\" found Carrie trying to leave a few feminine belongings at Mr. Big's apartment with little success, charting the challenges and limits of intimacy. And the season's finale, \"Ex and the City,\" was a melancholy goodbye for Carrie and Big that took its cue fromThe Way We Were. It wasn't all angst, though: among other adventures, Charlotte (Kristin Davis) puzzles over whether one of her beaus was \"gay-straight\" or \"straight-gay\"; Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) tries to date a guy who insists on having sex only in places where they might get caught; and Samantha (the exquisite Kim Cattrall) copes with dates who range from, um, not big enough tofartoo big--with numerous stops in between. Through it all, the four actresses cohered into a solid ensemble that played on their complex relationships among themselves as well as with men; in two short years, Parker and company became one of the best TV casts in over a decade. And to top it all off, the second season offers 18 episodes, six more than the first. Sometimes size really can make a difference!--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00004RFCM", "B00382S9SW", "B00382S9T6", "B00382S9TQ", "B00382S9U0", "B00382S9UA", "B00AYVDUPW", "B00AQ5RRJQ", "B002ZG98Z0", "B001DDBCUA", "B001675YWK", "B00IKX4LEK", "B001675YW0", "B005IFIUEU", "B0002SDY1W", "B006WZIB1C", "B00FKNR3W0", "B00AS870P2", "B002ZG98ZA", "B000P6YNTI", "B000FIMG4U", "B00AIQAS76", "B00079FUI6", "B001VPJZ0O", "B00009Y3RW", "B000FIMG5Y", "0446617687", "B0000844MI", "B000CNGCAM", "B000G1R3A8", "B0018CWEYO", "B001DDBCV4", "B001VPJYZK", "B0002I84FS", "B0018CWEXK", "B003TNW04Y", "B004SEUJK0", "B00005JO9J", "B000P6YNSO", "B00382S9SM", "B000NA78SE", "B00062IDZQ", "B00466HN7M", "B0001907BW", "B0058YPNPK", "B00684J49U", "B00GOC74Z2", "B00003CXC5", "B0002UE1WQ", "B009Z5BPZK", "B0009CTVLS", "B000068CNX", "B004UXUWOW", "B0008KLV8M", "B003TNW02G", "B00003CXOP", "B000BYA4I8", "B0001CCXZW", "B000BDH6AI", "B003TNW030", "B0018QPPXW", "B00GB0ORJ8", "B003F3NE1Q", "0792844874", "B003IB0FUS", "B005IA9JVI", "B003F3NDP8", "B002N5N4DA", "B008LCRAFC", "B00ATP24DW", "B00079Z9VO", "B003R0MEW2", "B0007YXRCW", "B008L0YMUK", "B006ISJQ1W", "B003F3NDW6", "B0038N9WKU", "B008L0YN6I", "B0037QGS0A", "B000NJISIY", "B002HK9IMW", "B001MVWMIO", "B002G1K82Q", "B000IMUYJM", "B00005JN4H", "B009TE9GNK", "B004A8ZWVK", "B009RX7WTI", "B000EHSV5K", "B003L77GQ0", "B0030Y11XS", "B003L77G06", "B00AB65SVE", "B00AEFY5TI", "B0024FAR5M", "B004EPZ084", "B0092Q82LC", "B000V86OKG", "B000YABIQ6"], "bought_together": ["B00382S9SW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00382S9SM", "B00004RFCM", "B00382S9SW", "B00382S9UA"]}, "price": 25.98, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 39965}, "asin": "B00005AVCA", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51nsgO17NKL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Sex and the City: Season 2"}

Aristocrats gather together for a weekend shooting party with their dutiful servants in tow, and the upstairs/downstairs division of the classes is perfectly tailored to Altman's method (as employed inNashvilleandShort Cuts) of overlapping bits of dialogue and numerous subplots in order to betray underlying motives and the sins that propel them. Greed, vengeance, snobbery, and lust stir comic unrest as the near dizzying effect of brisk script turns is allayed by perhaps Altman's strongest ensemble to date. First and foremost, Maggie Smith is marvelous as Constance, a dependent countess with a quip for every occasion; Michael Gambon, as the ill-fated host, Sir William McCordle, is one of the most palpably salacious characters ever on screen; Kristin Scott Thomas is perfectly cold yet sexy as Lady Sylvia, Sir William's wife; and Helen Mirren, Emily Watson, and Clive Owen are equally memorable as key characters from the bustling servants' quarters below.Gosford Parkmanages to be fabulously entertaining while exposing human shortcomings, compromises, and our endless need for confession.--Fionn Meade", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000BITVAG", "B007A2O3FO", "B00003CXC9", "B005S9EJ14", "B0000CE684", "B00AZMFO6I", "B0080QOL10", "630560097X", "B000LPS34E", "B000E8JNQU", "B004ALIG2O", "B00005UNCB", "B004JMSIQS", "6305692696", "B00F1BFRA6", "B002TZS58I", "B0002DRDY6", "B004SIP7D0", "B000E0ODZE", "B0001US78G", "B004XVMCMQ", "B004XYOQU4", "1557045313", "B005SYZYYK", "B000F3UAFC", "B000063K2Q", "B00003CX8N", "B0009GX1CE", "B001KP2J3U", "B0006Z2NAY", "B008NNY8TK", "B00062IZ0Y", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B005CFBZX4", "B004U7MQZ6", "B0001I55M4", "B00005O7N8", "0788815490", "B00GSBMNOQ", "B003UESJH4", "B0001DCYUU", "B0000797E7", "B008RO6PJQ", "B0013K2ZGI", "B000ETRCN0", "B00005OBAL", "B0009PVZM8", "6305918880", "B0080QOKYS", "B00HUAH14Q", "B00009IB1D", "B000A8AXXG", "B00GWXI16O", "B00C888OFA", "B00GAXASLC", "1250020360", "B000N4SHOE", "B004H0ZHD4", "B0099Y2MYK", "B009B1EPQ4", "B001CW7ZT4", "1573629723", "B009T6CXG0", "B001GJ4U5A", "B004SIP98S", "B00G15MDI0", "B00B62R9XM", "B004SIP9U6", "B0080QOL1A", "B000069HZU", "B004N66XYE", "B004XVMCKS", "1250047900", "B004499LWG", "B00AY2DL78", "6305428557", "B00A1EOC22", "B00D49YEHO", "B00BTYJYR6", "B0001US61O", "B0006Q9482", "B007701RFS", "B0073U2EWM", "B00F98FOI6", "B000092T3P", "B000CCW2O8", "B000065V3V", "B004HHX9H8", "B00HYZ0ZLS", "B00JFH8GZA", "B003DUBAXK", "B00AEFYO5I", "B00005U2KC", "B004SIP7F8", "B00GAHJO8G", "B00005RDRO", "B00DW5IKWK", "B00D3PYQT0", "B00005JOA0"], "bought_together": ["B000BITVAG", "B005S9EJ14"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AZMFO6I", "B000BITVAG", "630560097X", "B00005UNCB"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 7477}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 10.27, "brand": "Universal Studios", "asin": "B00005JKNF", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51oleUlbquL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Gosford Park - Collector's Edition"}
{"description": "The classic science fiction novel by H.G. Wells becomes this big-budget adventure directed by the author's great-grandson Simon Wells. Guy Pearce stars as Alexander Hartdegen, a scientist, professor, and inventor in 1895 New York City who believes that time travel is possible. The sudden and unexpected death of his fianc&#x82;e spurs Alexander to build a time machine, which he hopes to use in an effort to change the past. When he is unable to change the past, Alexander hurls himself more than 800,000 years into the future, seeking answers about the nature of time, but instead encountering a dystopian world where humanity has divided up into two races, the peaceful Eloi and the subterranean Morlocks. Befriending the beautiful Eloi woman Mara (pop singer Samantha Mumba), Alexander must set out to save her from the underground world of the Morlocks when she is captured by them. Along the way, he is aided by Vox (Orlando Jones), a bio-mechanical being from the 21st century. Ultimately, Alexander makes a shocking discovery about the true nature of the Eloi and Morlocks and decides that the only way to change the future is to alter the present. Due to exhaustion, director Wells was briefly replaced during the last few weeks of production by Gore Verbinski, director of The Mexican (2001). The Time Machine co-stars Jeremy Irons and Mark Addy.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0045HCJSA", "B001BGS17Q", "B000CZ0PNK", "B00LNBQ8SI", "B00LMCDHMS", "B00LNBQ8UG", "B00ANDFL3A", "B00IYJFB2G", "0780619951", "B0000639BZ", "B00003CXXP", "B00003CWU3", "630587493X", "B00K2CHVSK", "B00007JMD8", "B00005JNTI", "B00L4K3MLE", "B00005JKU0", "B00AEBB8VK", "B000FVQLKW", "B00K2CHWYI", "B00LCAD24S", "B00005JKFR", "B001SGEUYW", "0780622650", "B005FQ2H8W", "B0019ESNGY", "B002945DU2", "B00AEBB8QK", "B00020HAWE", "B00000G3PA", "B00009NHC0", "0790750201", "B000HEWEDK", "B001P9N94E", "B00IKM5N1G", "B00008G8M5", "B00005JL78", "B000O78KWE", "B0000844I8", "B0050MB5KM", "B00007G1YQ", "B008JFUO36", "B00D9EJFZA", "B0000AUHOH", "B00133KHBK", "B002UZCJ8Y", "B00IKM5LXG", "B000096IAC", "B00003CXKM", "B0016I0AJG", "B00008G8M4", "B000YDOOHI", "B00K7IPGS6", "B003NH3X5Q", "B008JFUNHI", "B00005N5S5", "0767812166", "B001EAWMGA", "B0045HCJ0S", "B002NZK5SM", "B00ECW9UJY", "B004B93RDS", "B001AR0D4A", "B00HWWUQYY", "B0009X75J2", "B000K7VHQ4", "B00004W46I", "B00009ATIX", "B000SFJ4K4", "B000HC2LZS", "B000KGGIV4", "B003BJO8KU", "B00AZMFJYA", "B00008438U", "B000QQJ3Q0", "B001BSBBNK", "6305090564", "B000BUNZY2", "B006VRRGNK", "079073639X", "B0074JOUHE", "B00AEBBA72", "B00J5LXMTG", "B000C20VNM", "B001A4VH3Y", "B00JL6L4UY", "B000063UR0", "B00079HZS4", "B00AEFXT7W", "B002BFBB4Q", "0783226063", "B000MX7V70", "0783231032", "B00005Y6XR", "B00BTYPW7C", "B00006JDRG", "0783240961", "1558908846", "B0013LL2Z2"], "bought_together": ["B0045HCJSA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0045HCJSA", "B001BGS17Q", "B00AIBZMD6", "B0090SI56Y"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 14168}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 15.26, "brand": "Dreamworks Skg", "asin": "B00005JKLZ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RZF2PBJAL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Time Machine"}
{"description": "The key component of this Vista Series DVD is a six-part documentary about the making of the film from idea to theatrical release. M. Night Shyamalan talks at length about the film and his filmmaking technique in this exclusive one-hour feature.

{"description": "The plethora of extras on this two-disc set are worth your time. There are several well-produced segments on the physical aspects of the film highlighted by a tour of the vast Cinecitt&#xE0; Studio sets with director Martin Scorsese and production designer Dante Ferretti (with a 360-degree-view feature to boot). Historian Luc Sante introduces you to the Five Corners area in New York circa the mid-19th century, and there's a vintage vocabulary guide (from the 1859 edition ofThe Rogue's Lexicon). Even though it was made as a \"puff piece\" for the movie, the Discovery Channel show \"Uncovering the Real Gangs of New York\" is an informative half-hour on the film's historical background. There's another espresso double-shot from a Scorsese commentary track. Not recorded traditionally as he watches the movie, the track pieces together thoughts from the director including some recorded in an NPR interview. This allows Scorsese to be even more focused, dealing with the history of the time and his own 30-year struggle to make the film. One serious demerit for stretching the feature film over both discs, which most likely had to be done with having both Dolby 5.1 and DTS tracks along with the commentary on the long film.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000M341QE", "B00AEBB9CS", "B00080ZG10", "B00AEBB8NI", "B006OFN0SE", "B00005JLSB", "B000C20VPA", "B000MZHW40", "B001N44BVQ", "B002ZG980U", "B000P0J09M", "B00049QQHI", "B004SIP8ZM", "0767830555", "6305313687", "B0006GAOJA", "B00008975Z", "B0016Q2D66", "B0000DI87S", "B00008DP4C", "B00011CZRE", "B000P0J0EW", "B00004XPPB", "B008R65XYC", "B005LAIIJY", "B0007DFJ0G", "B000C20VRS", "B004SIP95G", "B000286RP2", "B002CPMB9O", "B002T9H2LA", "0307388980", "B004SIP7ZS", "B000A7DVR2", "B00AEFXKUI", "B008MILL8W", "B00AEBB9F0", "B001EZE5DI", "B00AEBB9NM", "B004FQX5B6", "B002QEHPQU", "B004SIP9Z6", "B00H9KKGTO", "B004SIP6GI", "B002VWNIEA", "B0001FGBUW", "B000A2UBN4", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B00003CWM3", "B008D1Q1VA", "B00005V9HH", "B003ASLJQI", "B003ASLJQS", "B007SPPANM", "B000093FLA", "B00003CXZ4", "B00004XPPG", "B00001ZWUS", "B000H5TH20", "B000FKO5QK", "B002ZG99N6", "6304711905", "B0018CMJSU", "0767817710", "B009AMANBA", "079284646X", "B000FS9FCG", "B000065U1N", "B00AEBB89W", "B000P0J0AG", "B004SIP6QI", "B001QTXM5Y", "B004499LWG", "0783227906", "B00AEFY0F2", "B000J4P9P8", "B001GZ6QC4", "B00AEFY5B6", "B00AEBB95K", "B000NOKFHQ", "B002VWNICC", "B00009W5CA", "B004U7MR14", "B004AOECXI", "B00003CXRM", "0783231202", "B000069HZP", "0783229526", "B001JIE7JC", "B00005221M", "B000N6TX1I", "B00005JMJG", "B000N3SRO0", "B00003CXWV", "B00005JMYI", "B003HKN52U", "0790732238", "B00004U103", "B003UESJHO", "B000P0J09C"], "bought_together": ["B000M341QE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002ZG980U", "B000P0J09M", "B0013FXWU6", "B00H9KKGTO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 46244}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.89, "brand": "Miramax", "asin": "B00005JKN9", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516W0haa4aL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Gangs of New York (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)"}
{"description": "WithThe Return of the King, the greatest fantasy epic in film history draws to a grand and glorious conclusion. Director Peter Jackson's awe-inspiring adaptation of the Tolkien classicThe Lord of the Ringscould never fully satisfy those who remain exclusively loyal to Tolkien's expansive literature, but as a showcase for physical and technical craftsmanship it is unsurpassed in pure scale and ambition, setting milestone after cinematic milestone as the brave yet charmingly innocent Hobbit Frodo (Elijah Wood) continues his mission to Mordor, where he is destined to destroy the soul-corrupting One Ring of Power in the molten lava of Mount Doom. While the heir to the kingdom of Men, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), endures the massive battle at Minas Tirith with the allegiance of the elf Legolas (Orlando Bloom), dwarf Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) and the great wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen), Frodo and stalwart companion Samwise Gamgee (Sean Astin) must survive the schizoid deceptions of Gollum, who remains utterly convincing as a hybrid of performance (by Andy Serkis) and subtly nuanced computer animation.Jackson and cowriters Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens have much ground to cover; that they do so with intense pacing and epic sweep is impressive enough, but by investing greater depth and consequence in the actions of fellow Hobbits Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd), they ensure thatReturn of the Kingmaintains the trilogy's emphasis on intimate fellowship. While several major characters appear only briefly, and one (Christopher Lee's evil wizard, Saruman) relegated entirely to the extended version on DVD, Jackson is to be commended for his editorial acumen; like Legolas the archer, his aim as a filmmaker is consistently true, and he remains faithful to Tolkien's overall vision. IfReturnsuffers from too many endings, as some critic suggested, it's only because the epic's conclusion is so loyally inclusive of the actors--most notably Astin--who gave it such strength to begin with. By ending theLOTRtrilogy with noble integrity and faith in the power of imaginative storytelling,The Return of the King, like its predecessors, will stand as an adventure for the ages.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JKZV", "B00003CWT6", "B00BEZTMFY", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B002ZG980U", "B002PMV9FG", "B008UZA8FY", "B001NGML48", "B00005JM5E", "B001GZ6QC4", "B005COPWZW", "B008M4C1EO", "B00HFFE8HE", "039548930X", "B000W7F5SS", "B000I0RQVI", "B002VWNIDG", "B000E6EK2Y", "B001BYMX4A", "B004M1A21K", "B007K3JFUQ", "B001DHXT20", "B001UV4XHY", "0345325818", "B003Y5H54W", "B00005JNJV", "B00E5I2M6I", "B000A3XY5A", "B004LWZWGA", "B000U7WV1Y", "B005LXQLRW", "B001OQCV6A", "B000E8M0VA", "B004SIP8ZM", "B000EHRVMY", "0618640150", "B003ZK99NQ", "B0013FDM7E", "B00005JPH2", "B000UNYK4E", "B009JBWOU0", "B00003CX5P", "B00008G8M5", "B00GKOJ98E", "B004LWZW42", "B000H30B2C", "B000P0J0C4", "B00CZDLGDU", "B000M341QE", "B00008G8M4", "B000FKO5QK", "B00HWWUQYY", "B007SPPANM", "B008JFUO72", "B001DJLD1M", "0345538374", "B00AEFY5B6", "B00005JKCH", "B004SIP9U6", "B000YGGNMO", "B00E5I2M9K", "0618126988", "B005OCFGTO", "B00E8S2JZ4", "6305313687", "B004AKCME8", "B0002KVUKM", "B000AARKOO", "B0006GAO5Y", "B000K7VHQ4", "B002ZG997C", "B00AHTYI5M", "B008JFUS0U", "B0042MEQVG", "B00275EGWY", "B00E9PMML2", "B008UZDXEW", "B004SIP7F8", "B00116GEJS", "B00003CXI1", "B003ZKBELG", "B003Y5H5EW", "B000V4UFZK", "B0007PLLBU", "B001DTPZNY", "B002O3Z50Q", "B001GCUO1Q", "B000LP6KNU", "B005G4TJUC", "B00AW0KHTM", "B002ZG97YM", "054792819X", "B00AEFXZJE", "B0000YEEGM", "B002IPFWTE", "B001ECQ75A", "B000065U1N", "B0051MKNV8", "B000W796OM", "B00J49R1BY"], "bought_together": ["B00005JKZV", "B00003CWT6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00HFFE8HE", "B00003CWT6", "B00005JKZV", "B00BEZTMFY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 1589}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.49, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00005JKZY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HS7iSFv5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)"}

{"description": "An enormously entertaining (if somewhat shallow) affair from blockbuster   director Steven Spielberg. Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Frank Abagnale,  Jr., a  dazzling young con man who spent four years impersonating an  airline pilot, a  doctor, and a lawyer--all before he turned 21. All the  while he's pursued by a  dedicated FBI agent named Carl Hanratty (Tom  Hanks), whose dogged determination  stays one step behind Abagnale's  spontaneous wits. Both DiCaprio and Hanks turn  in enjoyable  performances and the movie has a bouncy rhythm that keeps it  zipping  along. However, it never gets under the surface of Frank's drive to lose   himself in other identities, other than a simplistic desire to please  his father  (Christopher Walken, excellent as always), nor does it  explore the complex  mechanics of fraud with any depth. By the movie's  end, it feels like one of  Frank's pilot uniforms--appearance without  substance.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00080ZG10", "B006OFN0SE", "B000M341QE", "B00AEBB8NI", "B001EZE5DI", "B004SIP7TE", "B000MZHW40", "0767905385", "B00005JMYC", "B002ZG980U", "B00049QQHI", "B0016Q2D66", "B00AEBB9F0", "B00003CWM3", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B000P0J0EW", "B00008DP4C", "B000PHVZNE", "B001N44BVQ", "B00005JOC9", "B004SIP7ZS", "B0007DFJ0G", "B007SPPANM", "B00H9KKGTO", "B002T9H2LA", "0800141806", "B000N6U0E2", "B000P0J0EM", "B00AEBB89W", "B000FVQLQQ", "B00001ZWUS", "B0050546MS", "B00DHHWXYY", "0783225733", "6304711891", "B00AEFY0F2", "B002VWNIEA", "B0051MKNV8", "B002ZG99N6", "B0077ATSSQ", "B00011CZRE", "B0013XZ2QK", "B00275EGWY", "B00005JKBC", "B00003CXWV", "B002O5M4T4", "B002FU8IWU", "B008MILL8W", "B004XQO90O", "B004SIP95G", "B000YAF4MA", "B005LAIIJY", "B00005JMJG", "B002QEHPQU", "0780631536", "B00DHDDE32", "B0031OCY2E", "0783240295", "B000P0J0BK", "B004FQX5B6", "B0034G4OUO", "B005HWAOP2", "6305313687", "B003UESJH4", "B000YABYLA", "B00005JKWX", "B00BEIYL6G", "B0058JEHSO", "B000A7DVR2", "B0002ZDVEU", "B00003CXZ1", "B00003CXQ4", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00005RYLX", "B001VPCINK", "B000FKO5QK", "B0045HCJRG", "B009POCG0Y", "B00AEBB9SM", "B002UZCJ8Y", "B002DU39GW", "6304806434", "B00JQYV0B4", "B00AEFXE9U", "B00004WG2F", "B000EXZFCQ", "B00005JMCN", "B00006RCNV", "B000K7VHQE", "B00441GYXS", "B00A24CAAW", "B0045HCJ8K", "B004SIP9Z6", "B002NZK5R8", "B000K7VHTQ", "B00AEFXXMI", "B00005JL78", "0783233477", "B000J3OTT6", "B000O77SRC"], "bought_together": ["B00080ZG10", "B000M341QE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004SIP7TE", "B002ZG980U", "B00AEBB8NI", "B00ALTQRPW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 7335}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.99, "brand": "Dreamworks Skg", "asin": "B00005JLSB", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51bPnAto--L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Catch Me If You Can (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition)"}

{"description": "It's not that the folks at Pixar are geniuses when it comes to DVDs... well, come to think of it, their fifth DVD set shows these folks are wizards. It's not just that the two discs are packed with watchable extras that hardly reiterate the same information; it's how they are handled--funny, inventive, with a light touch--unlike many PR-driven discs. A good place to start is the filmmakers' jolly commentary track, which branches off into 31 minutes of behind-the-scene stuff, deleted scenes, and curious anecdotes (they can also be watched separately). Pixar's first making-of documentary is a most concise and interesting 25-minute examination that also sheds light on how the company works. With a digital-to-digital transfer, the film looks great and is available in widescreen or reformatted to full screen. The \"Family Fun\" disc includes another Pixar made-for-the-DVD gem, the 7-minute \"Exploring the Reef\" with Jean-Michel Cousteau (Jacques's son) being upstaged by Dori and Marlin; it's a hoot and teaches a fact or two you will remember about reefs. Both discs feature lovely menus that can be turned into virtual aquariums for your TV (by removing the text) featuring the knockout colors of the film's settings. Watch long enough for some shenanigans from the film's characters and vocal talent. Genius, pure genius.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00EV1YZ96", "B00AFEX83C", "B00007LVCM", "B00005JNS0", "B0030IIZ4M", "B00GDT5T9Y", "B003ZHVJGO", "B00G5G7EXY", "B00003CXB4", "B001KVZ6FW", "B0013FSL3E", "B004HO6I4M", "B00005JN4W", "B000MV9026", "B004G600A4", "B000AY74OG", "B000VBJEEG", "B0006UEVT0", "B008YWY0HK", "B003H9M1Q2", "B00CQRN3QI", "B0001I561E", "B0042U94UQ", "B00E9ZATJO", "B000YERP2S", "B0006JMLRK", "B000AAF1TU", "B0000AOX0O", "B00CTNYLQA", "B00F522C7C", "B0039N74CW", "B00003CXCQ", "B001ILFUDC", "B00275EHJG", "B001HN6922", "0736429220", "B000B8QG4A", "B000RMJ4F8", "B0084IHVN4", "B002ZG97YM", "B001ECQ75A", "B004ZBACOE", "B0030IIYYS", "B0084IHVGG", "B00E9ZATKI", "B00AO686JC", "B000GUJZ00", "B00004R99S", "B0012EM5D8", "B0084IHVUC", "B0013ND30M", "B0034JKZ86", "B0000VV4W2", "B00003CX8Y", "B008JFUQ16", "B001DPHDCY", "B00005TN8K", "B00CUDD0C0", "B00A83075M", "B001O5LVPI", "B001NCDFTW", "B00G7TIKMI", "B0000E32WJ", "B00CWM58WY", "B001ILFUD2", "B00009YXAW", "B00CMY3JBO", "B00335EQ0E", "B005LAIISA", "0783231474", "B0002YLCOM", "B00E00OGE2", "B000H7JCK0", "B000UVKGPI", "B00005JMQZ", "B00JK531ES", "B00004U9WQ", "B005LAIH4A", "B005LAIHW2", "B00024I2Z4", "B00I6JOD2S", "B008NNY9QW", "B0000VCZKM", "B00FE8BVF6", "6302526574", "B004EPZ034", "B000L22SG6", "B001OMU6UM", "B00E56D8FO", "B0000524D0", "B002WJI2QQ", "B0009CTT6U", "B000050MN3", "B000B8QG3G", "B0058AFS0O", "B00006FDAI", "B00EGIAQ1K", "B000A7G4TY"], "bought_together": ["B00EV1YZ96", "B00G5G7EXY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00EV1YZ96", "B00AFEX83C", "B00I6JOD2S", "B004HO6I4M"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 7746}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 25.5, "brand": "Disney", "asin": "B00005JM02", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51-difUGanL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)"}

H.M. \"Howling Mad\" Murdock (Dwight Schultz)--assist (mostly) ordinary people having a problem with bad guys. The A-Team ostensibly charges large fees, but much of the time the guys seem to be doing pro bono work for the helpless.Season Onehighlights include \"Children of Jamestown,\" starring John Saxon as a Jim Jones-like religious cult leader who captures Hannibal, Face, B.A., and first-season sidekick Amy \"Triple A\" Allen (Melinda Culea). While the resourceful group invents a super-weapon out of farm equipment, crazy Murdock commandeers a helicopter and dynamite. Also good is \"A Small and Deadly War,\" featuring Dean Stockwell as one of several uncontrolled L.A. cops committing murder-for-hire. \"The Out-of-Towners\" takes a page from theDeath Wishmovie series with a story about New York City shop owners harassed by a protection racketeer (Yaphet Kotto). Hannibal and company retaliate with machine guns (no one is ever seen killed in this series) and, more effectively, public humiliation of the villain. The best thing aboutThe A-Teamis the relationship between the four offbeat heroes, who may not always like each other (B.A. usually looks as if he'd like to leave Murdock in a shallow grave) but get the job done expertly.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0007LXP7W", "B000E5KQLY", "B000BUE5CI", "B000GW8U9U", "B00DGNFMNS", "B00DGNFMJW", "B00DGNFMMY", "B00HUPC5QU", "B00FWMVVJ0", "B000BUE5D2", "B000E5KQM8", "B0024FAD7Y", "B0072BNKIO", "B0006IUDXA", "B002ZG994U", "B0007YMWFK", "B0007Y08SS", "B000BGR1B4", "B005LFQRTC", "B000IONJI8", "B00HZMZ286", "B000BB1MJ6", "B000N2HD6O", "B004UV3KS4", "B0006BAWR4", "B002WQ79A4", "B0009S4IM4", "B000LXGXY8", "B000N4RAQA", "B000XJD3K2", "B000BF0C8E", "B001JFKWE4", "B000GTLB4Y", "B00005JMHI", "B000ERVJMC", "B00005JOJR", "B0009W5J3M", "B000BDH6DK", "B000EMG90O", "B00555ZTQK", "B000O77SNG", "B00G3BRC24", "B0007XG26G", "B000PFUANC", "B000FDDYPA", "B000MLWQ6I", "B008OR5X6M", "B000ERVJKY", "B00962R0H4", "B000MLWQ6S", "B000CNESLW", "B00KHA9BQ2", "B004UV3KSY", "B003L77FWA", "B000HLDF9U", "B000OVLMKC", "B0012EM5EW", "B00JEZWRE4", "B0006N2EZK", "B000IHYXIK", "B00DYQ1G78", "B004UV3KSE", "B000SQFC2M", "B00HQLZCIQ", "B00DXLO0D6", "B0009JE6FC", "B00F4CIPRE", "B00HRUQ8YS", "B00BWQU0RY", "B0089BSLKS", "B002L9N4O2", "B000FSME1K", "B000NOIX7K", "B00005JLEY", "B0006BAWSI", "B005ZVIMUE", "B000LE16VC", "B00GOC75YW", "B0011FLGZQ", "B0014VPFM2", "B0007KIFK0", "B000GW8UAE", "B00A33J8FM", "B0025VKX04", "B001J2XROY", "B00HW3L9MG", "B004M9ZI0C", "B00DD56724", "B00005JM3A", "B003L77FWU", "B00BB8LU5Y", "B0025KVTLW", "B0006Z2KZ2", "B000CCBCK8", "B0002Y4T7O", "B000M343B2", "B0049GYXCW", "B003W5C0TY", "B00ESK1PES", "B0028S1100"], "bought_together": ["B0007LXP7W", "B000E5KQLY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0007LXP7W", "B000GW8U9U", "B000E5KQLY", "B00DGNFMJW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 70093}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 22.16, "brand": "", "asin": "B00005JN80", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/512DFJG09VL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The A-Team - Season One"}

{"description": "Batman Beginsdiscards the previous four films in the series and recasts the Caped Crusader as a fearsome avenging angel. That's good news, because the series, which had gotten off to a rousing start under Tim Burton, had gradually dissolved into self-parody by 1997'sBatman & Robin. As the title implies,Batman Beginstells the story anew, when Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) flees Western civilization following the murder of his parents. He is taken in by a mysterious instructor named Ducard (Liam Neeson in another mentor role) and urged to become a ninja in the League of Shadows, but he instead returns to his native Gotham City resolved to end the mob rule that is strangling it. But are there forces even more sinister at hand?Cowritten by the team of David S. Goyer (a veteran comic book writer) and director Christopher Nolan (Memento),Batman Beginsis a welcome return to the grim and gritty version of the Dark Knight, owing a great debt to the graphic novels that preceded it. It doesn't have the razzle dazzle, or the mass appeal, ofSpider-Man 2(though the Batmobile is cool), and retelling the origin means it starts slowly, like most \"first\" superhero movies. But it's certainly the best Bat-film since Burton's original, and one of the best superhero movies of its time. Bale cuts a good figure as Batman, intense and dangerous but with some of the lightheartedness Michael Keaton brought to the character. Michael Caine provides much of the film's humor as the family butler, Alfred, and as the love interest, Katie Holmes (Dawson's Creek) is surprisingly believable in her first adult role.

Only Spooner suspects that the robots that provide the near future with menial labor are going to turn on mankind--he's just not sure how. When a leading roboticist dies suspiciously, Spooner pursues a trail that may prove his suspicions. Don't expect much of a connection to Isaac Asimov's classic science fiction stories;I, Robot, the action movie, isn't prepared for any ruminations on the significance of artificial intelligence. This likable, efficient movie won't break any new ground, but it does have an idea or two to accompany its jolts and thrills, which puts it ahead of most recent action flicks.

{"description": "Marvel Comics' first family of superherodom, the Fantastic Four, hits the big screen in a light-hearted and funny adventure.  It begins when down-on-his-luck genius Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd,Horatio Hornblower) has to enlist the financial and intellectual help from former schoolmate and rival Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon,Nip/Tuck) in order to pursue outer-space research into human DNA.  Also on the trip are Reed's best friend, Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis,The Shield); his former lover, Sue Storm (Jessica Alba,Dark Angel,Sin City), who's now Doom's employee and love interest; and her hotshot-pilot brother, Johnny Storm (Chris Evans,Cellular).  Things don't go as planned, of course, and the quartet becomes blessed--or is it cursed?--with superhuman powers: flexibility, brute strength, invisibility and projecting force fields, and bursting into flame.  Meanwhile, Doom himself is undergoing a transformation.Among the many entries in the comic-book-movie frenzy,Fantastic Fouris refreshing because it doesn't take itself too seriously. Characterization isn't too deep, and the action is a bit sparse until the final reel (like most \"first\" superhero movies, it has to go through the \"how did we get these powers and what we will do with them\" churn). But it's a good-looking cast, and original comic-book cocreator Stan Lee makes his most significant Marvel-movie cameo yet, in a speaking role as the FF's steadfast postal carrier, Willie Lumpkin. Newcomers to superhero movies might find the idea of a family with flexibility, strength, invisibility, and force fields a retread ofThe Incredibles, but Pixar's animated film was very much a tribute to the FF and other heroes of the last 40 years. The irony is that whileFantastic Fouris an enjoyable B-grade movie, it's the tribute,The Incredibles, that turned out to be a film for the ages.--David HoriuchiOn the DVDThe principal extra on the DVD is a spirited commentary track by Jessica Alba, Michael Chiklis, and Ioan Gruffud.  Self-avowed FF fan Chiklis explains why the Thing doesn't have a craggy brow, Alba recalls which things were \"cool,\" and they talk about looking forward to the sequel. There are three short deleted scenes (including a goofy Wolverine reference), 20 minutes of barely watchable hand-held video footage from the press tour, music videos, and some short featurettes including an appearance by FF creator Stan Lee.--David HoriuchiThe Fantastic Four at Amazon.comComics and Graphic NovelsDisney animated seriesThe classic comic bookMovie tie-in graphic novelThe Xbox gameFantastic FourSoundtrackThe Fantastic CastJessica Albaas Sue StormMichael Chiklisas The ThingIoan Gruffuddas Reed RichardsChris Evansas Johnny StormStills fromFantastic Four(click for larger images)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000VI70QS", "B0000959N0", "B001DHXT20", "B0007P0Y7C", "B004EPZ07K", "B001CDR1FG", "B00E5I2MEK", "B001GCUO1Q", "B00E5I2M9K", "B00E5I2MCM", "B000OVLBF8", "B00005JMQW", "B008JFUO72", "B004LWZW42", "B00E5I2M6I", "B000UR9T8C", "B0090SI56Y", "B000HEVZ9E", "B000HCO83Q", "B00005JKCH", "B005OY6LBE", "B001OQCVI8", "B008JFUS0U", "B004LWZWFQ", "B000AYELVU", "B0002IQMAM", "B003YAR97K", "B0083SBMBM", "B001QB9H1U", "B001AK3S4Y", "B005LAIGW8", "B000AYELVA", "B001F7MSFM", "B0006L0LOS", "B003H8F3AY", "B008JFUPFI", "B006DHAT5K", "B002GSXKN8", "B002ZG99G8", "B00005JNJV", "B002IPFWTE", "B002NXSRVG", "B000VR0570", "B0006D3HGA", "B004LWZWGA", "B005LAII44", "B000YV1Q2G", "B00F4FFO8E", "B005G4TJUC", "B00005JN0T", "B0007US7CQ", "B00E1HIXEI", "B000J10EQU", "B0002KVUKM", "B000VKL6T8", "B001TK80C0", "B002ZG99B8", "B000Y7U98C", "B002GSXKNI", "B00005JM5B", "B001GZ6QC4", "B000PFUAP0", "B00005JKWJ", "B0009P42WI", "B00174RCHW", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B00005JKYX", "B005TK0MFE", "B000VNMMPW", "B001QTXM5Y", "B000EU1Q7M", "B00008G8M4", "B000P6XQ50", "B00005JN5E", "B0007V6ITE", "B001VLBDD0", "B005LAIH54", "B001FB55HQ", "B000IJ79WU", "B008Y1YK9Y", "B00561BNJK", "B001VLFE7G", "B000CNER1S", "B00K7IPFSM", "B001BP4K22", "B00005JL78", "B0001CNRS4", "B00979KQD6", "B00157OI9Q", "B004EPYZUS", "B002HWRYJE", "B009YQJ322", "B003Y5H5EW", "0780624890", "B001RHGRT8", "B0013J55B6", "B0013BM63O", "B0053FANPY", "B009MO57H6", "078401132X"], "bought_together": ["B000VI70QS", "B001DHXT20"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000VI28Z6", "B000VI70QS", "B008JFUS0U", "B0090SI56Y"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 12162}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.98, "brand": "Twentieth Century Fox", "asin": "B00005JNTU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51AM4R5J04L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Fantastic Four (Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "In the DVD world, the Criterion Collection label generally indicates that you'll be getting your money's worth on the extras, andThe Life Aquatic with Steve Zissouis no exception. These two discs contain many features that fans of the film will expect: Seu Jorge performing David Bowie songs (complete versions), many documentary scenes of writer-director Wes Anderson at work, interviews with cast members including Cate Blanchett, Bill Murray, etc. Other extras are a little more confusing. For instance, does Seymour Cassel, who plays Zissou's deceased partner, know what he's doing when he complains to a hairless cigar merchant about having to go faux bald? And what's the deal withMondo Monda? It's a cringingly awkward Italian talk show in which the host (also an actor in the film) interviews the screenwriters, throwing out references so random and esoteric that even smart guys like Anderson and Noah Baumbach are left speechless. It's all a joke, right? In the end, the bonus material accomplishes its primary goal: get those who already enjoy the film to like it just a little bit more.--Leah Weathersby", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0010X8NF0", "6305428239", "B0000640VJ", "0767821408", "B007L6VR12", "B001QOGYBI", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B007L6VR6M", "B000CS464G", "B0006TPE4C", "081099741X", "B00005JMJ4", "B000934FC2", "B0035G5IOE", "B00JAQJNN0", "B00005JMJG", "B000BRD6T4", "B0045NXMJE", "B00007AJF8", "B00H9HZITU", "B0018BD9DA", "B004SEUIXS", "1623160510", "B001P3SA8K", "B000JMK6LW", "B0018O4YT0", "B001MM3AZM", "B0006H32EI", "B002E2M5IC", "B0012E2GFK", "B000M4RG7E", "B0007DFJ0G", "B000Y7U98C", "B001NPD9PY", "B00IJXJAIS", "B000A7DVR2", "B008MIMWP8", "B004FQX5B6", "B00GKOJ98E", "0783228457", "B000K7VHOG", "B002LMV7RA", "B00008RH3J", "B0009A40ES", "B00DL46ZN8", "0957490909", "B000F5GNX8", "B00005JLRE", "B00006AUIH", "B00005V9HH", "B00GMV8L1Q", "B001JIE7JM", "B000IU37SO", "B004RQDQIQ", "B00AEBB8SS", "B00006LPGP", "B00000K3TS", "B00H9L28OO", "B007D5E7C2", "B000065AI3", "B0033WH6MW", "B008220D5K", "B0014D5RBE", "B001BPJJ9G", "B00005JL78", "B007D0FVRM", "B00AEFYOJE", "B00003CXZ4", "6304493681", "B0083V2W4U", "B000Z8GZYW", "B008R65XNS", "0783229526", "B00HGGUTPW", "B003UESJMO", "B005HK13SG", "B000P0J0EW", "B002VWNIAY", "B000P0J0D8", "B004SIP7ZS", "B001HN69AY", "B003XURDAY", "B00H7KJRVY", "B00ECR7KX2", "B001GMAVGE", "B005LAIIJY", "B000055Y0X", "B0000AC8LR", "B000K7VHQE", "B00AEFYAMA", "6305922756", "B0041T52S6", "B009YQJ322", "B003CRM6PA", "B002T9H2LA", "B000O76ZQC", "B0040QYROA", "B005MYEQ4U", "B00I6JOD2S", "B00FZ4KR4U"], "bought_together": ["B0010X8NF0", "B0000640VJ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00JAQJMJ0", "B0010X8NF0", "B007L6VR12", "B0000640VJ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 72305}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.5, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B00005JNLQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51H5Q2VBE1L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou (The Criterion Collection)"}
{"description": "Along withDesperate Housewives,Lostwas one of the two breakout shows in the fall of 2004. Mixing suspense and action with a sci-fi twist, it began with a thrilling pilot episode in which a jetliner traveling from Australia to Los Angeles crashes, leaving 48 survivors on an unidentified island with no sign of civilization or hope of imminent rescue. That may sound likeGilligan's IslandmeetsSurvivor, butLostkept viewers tuning in every Wednesday night--and spending the rest of the week speculating on Web sites--with some irresistible hooks (not to mention the beautiful women). First, there's a huge ensemble cast of no fewer than 14 regular characters, and each episode fills in some of the back story on one of them. There's a doctor; an Iraqi soldier; a has-been rock star; a fugitive from justice; a self-absorbed young woman and her brother; a lottery winner; a father and son; a Korean couple; a pregnant woman; and others. Second, there's a host of unanswered questions: What is the mysterious beast that lurks in the jungle? Why do polar bears and wild boars live there? Why has a woman been transmitting an SOS message in French from somewhere on the island for the last 16 years? Why do impossible wishes seem to come true? Are they really on a physical island, or somewhere else? What is the significance of the recurring set of numbers? And will Kate ever give up her bad-boy fixation and hook up with Jack?Lostdid have some hiccups during the first season. Some plot threads were left dangling for weeks, and the \"oh, it didn't really happen\" card was played too often. But the strong writing and topnotch cast kept the show a cut above most network TV. The best-known actor at the time of the show's debut was Dominic Monaghan, fresh off his stint as Merry the Hobbit in Peter Jackson'sLord of the Ringsfilms. The rest of the cast is either unknowns or \"where I have I seen that face before\" supporting players, including Matthew Fox and Evangeline Lilly, who are the closest thing to leads. Other standouts include Naveen Andrews, Terry O'Quinn (who's made a nice career out of conspiracy-themed TV shows), Josh Holloway, Jorge Garcia, Yunjin Kim, Maggie Grace, and Emilie de Ravin, but there's really not a weak link in the cast.

The episodes are presented in widescreen format, just as they were broadcast on high-definition channels. (Conventional ABC-TV broadcasts were reduced to 1.33 full-screen format.) Four of the episodes have commentary tracks by the producing team and the actors who were featured on certain episodes (Terry O'Quinn, Dominic Monaghan, and Maggie Grace and Ian Sommerhalder). The last disc has over three hours of bonus material sensibly broken into three categories. \"Departure\" discusses the initial creation of the series, the making of the pilot, and the cast (some characters were created to fit the actors, and Evangeline Lilly's Kate was the hardest to cast). It also includes the cast's audition tapes and photographs by Matthew Fox. \"Tales from the Island\" provides background material on seven of the episodes plus the boars used in filming, Jimmy Kimmel's appearance on the set, and the genesis of the Driveshaft song (\"You all everybody...\"). Finally, \"Lost Revealed\" includes two scenes cut from the season finale, 13 other deleted scenes (not identified by episode, unfortunately), a blooper reel, and the cast and crew's giddy appearance at the Museum of Television & Radio.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000FIMG68", "B000P6YNSE", "B0018CWEYY", "B0019LY5IM", "B0036EH3XE", "B000ESSSK2", "B00G4SD75W", "B000QDLSR0", "B0018CWEZ8", "B001AQMBKA", "B000FKO3GW", "B0036EH3X4", "B000TFINY6", "B001B7CNZ6", "B002N5N5MK", "B002JVWRD6", "B0024FAD9C", "0756665949", "B00129W6LE", "B000BNI90Y", "1550227432", "1550228781", "1550227998", "B000YABIQ6", "1550229516", "1550228919", "B000AJJNFE", "B0009VBTP0", "B001AQMBJQ", "B0009A407A", "B000F3UAE8", "B000RO6JY0", "B0026RHR6U", "0615508294", "B001DJLCRC", "B0001O3YLM", "B001QE99AQ", "B003R0MEYA", "B003L77GJM", "B000FIMG5Y", "B00062IDEW", "1463548702", "B0038M2APA", "B0024FAR66", "B004TJ1GY2", "B002AMVED8", "B001MVWRNO", "B000I0QLR8", "B0000Y40PW", "B0024F08RO", "B000NDEXK2", "B001C4CI8U", "B00008YGRU", "B000FFJYC0", "B000N3T0EG", "B000EWBNMI", "B004LROMSO", "B00FFSTPDU", "B001HUWQEA", "B000GETTKM", "B00IWTVDUW", "B0024FAD9W", "B003L77GTC", "B002U0KHME", "B000FVQLIO", "B000W6ZUUC", "B0049P1VHS", "B009LDD4V4", "B0075FF5QM", "B0038M2AOG", "B000FOPPBA", "B001934SNM", "B0055SNHQG", "B00D2ZF24O", "B00079FUI6", "B0053O8A46", "B004YM6JK0", "B00B5ARKC0", "B00DII0MGI", "B00005JO9J", "B002BFBB0A", "B000AJJNI6", "B000Q6GUW0", "B002GOAH1A", "B00BHLTIXQ", "B008H6GHF6", "B003L77G2Y", "B00000FBH2", "B000FIMG4U", "B005S97V82", "B00CWIMVDW", "B000Q6GUKW", "B000P6YNSO", "B001GCUER0", "B001G0MFIS", "B0001HAGQK", "B001VPJYZK", "B001VPJYZ0", "0425188809", "B000BOH986"], "bought_together": ["B000FIMG68", "B000P6YNSE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000FIMG68", "B0036EH3XE", "B0018CWEYY", "B000P6YNSE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 5709}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 16.5, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B00005JNOG", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51nb5sJm%2B3L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Lost - The Complete First Season"}

{"description": "Helen Mirren reigns supreme inThe Queen, a witty and ingenious look at a moment that rocked the house of Windsor:  the week that followed the sudden death of Princess Diana in 1997. Diana's death came at just the same time that Prime Minister Tony Blair (played by the bright Michael Sheen) was settling into his new government--and trying to figure out the delicate relationship between 10 Downing Street and Queen Elizabeth II (Mirren). A large portion of the British population was trying to figure out the Windsors that week, as Elizabeth remained stiff-upper-lip and largely mum about the death of the beloved princess. In Peter Morgan's skillful script, we watch as Blair grows increasingly impatient with the Royals, who are sequestered in their Scottish estate while the public demands some show of grief. Prince Philip (James Cromwell, in good form) clumsily decides to take Diana's sons hunting, while a sympathetically-treated Prince Charles (Alex Jennings) displays some frustration with his mother's eerie calm.None of this conveys how funny the film is, or how deftly it flows from one scene to the next. Director Stephen Frears (Dirty Pretty Things) deserves great credit for that, and for the performances, and for the movie's marvelous sense of well-roundedness; you could see this movie and groan at the cluelessness of the Royals and their outmoded existence, or you might just sympathize with showing reserve in a world that values gross public displays of emotion. But either way, you'll marvel at Mirren, who makes the Queen far more alert and human than one might ever have imagined.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B003UESJH4", "B001C4AFOY", "B004M9QNVK", "B004GXKBDI", "B0059XTUVI", "B000Z8H0IC", "B000ZOXDFA", "B000RF7XYO", "B001L57ZZG", "B001TH92N4", "B000BKDNX0", "B0006Q93H4", "B000EOTELI", "B004XYOQU4", "B009TT0BSE", "B0012QE4Q2", "B001QUF3SW", "B007HW8U2Y", "B000EHQUGC", "B00342ANSA", "B004SIP9U6", "B000V02CNW", "B00005O7N8", "B00GM7STPI", "B003N9ASF2", "B002ZG99EK", "B004SIP71M", "B003Y5H4Y8", "B0001I55M4", "B001AZIRVI", "B00015HXDG", "B000E1NXJ0", "B000RF7XYY", "B00121QGPY", "B009AMANBA", "B000M06KJ8", "B000MEYJHY", "B00005JOFQ", "B007TBJUVI", "B0085A9JXG", "B003AND1SM", "B000NIVJF4", "B0010X73Z6", "B000K7VHQE", "B00005JKNF", "B000MCH5P4", "B001TR4G6W", "B004P7CNZO", "B0050PYNN0", "B000GH3CR0", "B00AEFY8MM", "B0068MNO4S", "B002RSDW80", "B001MVWFAO", "B004ZNFTDQ", "B000255LIY", "B000V6LSOA", "B00ARX2VZW", "B000G6BM0K", "B008220C38"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003UESJH4", "B004M9QNVK", "B001C4AFOY", "B004GXKBDI"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "asin": "B00005JPAM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51K34G0GCBL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Queen"}
{"description": "Critically hailed as an instant classic, Clint Eastwood'sLetters from Iwo Jimais a masterwork of uncommon humanity and a harrowing, unforgettable indictment of the horrors of war. In an unprecedented demonstration of worldly citizenship, Eastwood (from a spare, tightly focused screenplay by first-time screenwriter Iris Yamashita) has crafted a truly Japanese film, with Japanese dialogue (with subtitles) and filmed in a contemplative Japanese style, serving as both complement and counterpoint to Eastwood's previously released companion filmFlags of Our Fathers. Where the earlier film employed a complex non-linear structure and epic-scale production values to dramatize one of the bloodiest battles of World War II and its traumatic impact on American soldiers,Lettersreveals the battle of Iwo Jima from the tunnel- and cave-dwelling perspective of the Japanese, hopelessly outnumbered, deprived of reinforcements, and doomed to die in inevitable defeat. While maintaining many of the traditions of the conventional war drama, Eastwood extends his sympathetic touch to humanize \"the enemy,\" revealing the internal and external conflicts of soldiers and officers alike, forced by circumstance to sacrifice themselves or defend their honor against insurmountable odds. From the weary reluctance of a young recruit named Saigo (Kazunari Ninomiya) to the dignified yet desperately anguished strategy of Japanese commander Tadamichi Kuribayashi (played by Oscar-nominatedThe Last Samuraicostar Ken Watanabe), whose letters home inspired the film's title and present-day framing device,Letters from Iwo Jima(which conveys the bleakness of battle through a near-total absence of color) steadfastly avoids the glorification of war while paying honorable tribute to ill-fated men who can only dream of the comforts of home.--Jeff ShannonOn the DVDsLike the film itself, the two-disc special edition ofLetters from Iwo Jimais predominantly Japanese in content, and that's as it should be. Disc 1 presents the film in a  flawless widescreen transfer, with a Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround soundtrack that perfectly captures the film's wide dynamic range. The optional subtitles can be turned off for those wishing to immerse themselves in a completely Japanese viewing experience. Disc 2 opens with \"Red Sun, Black Sand: The Making ofLetters from Iwo Jima,\" a 20-minute behind-the-scenes documentary that concisely covers all aspects of production, from director Clint Eastwood's initial decision to create a companion piece toFlags of Our Fathers, to interview comments from principal cast and crew, the latter includingFlagsscreenwriters Paul Haggis andLettersscreenwriter Iris Yamashita, costume designer Deborah Hopper, editor Joel Cox, cinematographer Tom Stern, production designer James Murakami (taking over for the ailing Henry Bumstead), and coproducer Rob Lorenz. \"The Faces of Combat\" is an 18-minute featurette about selecting the Japanese (and Japanese-American) cast ofLetters, and how they were chosen through the international collaboration of Eastwood's long-time casting director Phyllis Huffman (who turned over some of her duties to her son while struggling with terminal illness) and Japanese casting associate Yumi Takada, who filled important roles with Japanese celebrities (like pop star Kazunari Ninomiya, who plays \"Saigo\") and unknown actors alike.\"Images from the Frontlines\" is a 3.5-minute montage of images from the film and behind-the-scenes, set to the sparse piano theme of Eastwood's original score. The remaining bonus features chronicle the world premiere ofLettersin Tokyo on November 15, 2006. The premiere itself is covered in a 16-minute featurette taped at the famous Budokan arena, where we see the red-carpet procession, a full-capacity audience despite cold November weather, and introductory comments from the film's primary cast and crew, many of them quite moving with regard to the satisfaction of working on a film that helps Japanese viewers come to terms with a painful chapter of their history. The following day's press conference (at the Grand Hyatt Tokyo hotel) is a 24-minute Q&A; session covering much of the same territory, with additional testimony from principal cast & crew.

{"description": "Leonardo DiCaprio puts a handsome face on an ugly industry: In parts of Africa, diamond mining fuels civil warfare, killing thousands of innocents and drafting preteen children as vicious soldiers. DiCaprio (The Departed) plays Danny Archer, a white African soldier-turned-diamond-smuggler who gets wind of a large raw jewel found by Solomon Vandy, a native fisherman (Djimon Hounsou,In America) recently escaped from enslavement by a brutal rebel leader. Archer offers a deal: He'll help Vandy find his war-scattered family if Vandy will share the diamond with him. Drawn into this web of exploitation is journalist Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly,Little Children), who agrees to help if Archer will tell her the details of how conflict diamonds make their way into the hands of the corporations who sell them to the Western world. DiCaprio is compelling because he never flinches from Archer's utter ruthlessness; Archer ends up doing the morally justifiable thing, but only because his desperate greed has led him to it. Hounsou and Connelly, though saddled with all the moral and political speeches, rise above the cant and keep the movie's treacherously formulaic plot rooted in human characters. But in the end, the story won't stick with you as much as the dead stillness in the child soldiers' eyes; the horror of African civil strife refuses to be contained byBlood Diamond's uplifting message--and the movie is all the more potent as a result.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001N44BVQ", "B000M341QE", "B00005JLSB", "B00AEBB8NI", "B00080ZG10", "B004SIP7TE", "B006OFN0SE", "B002ZG980U", "B000NIVJF4", "B0007R4T3U", "B0016Q2D66", "B00049QQHI", "B001EZE5DI", "B00003CWM3", "B00008DP4C", "6305268827", "B000BYA5G4", "B00AEBB9F0", "B000Y7WGOW", "B004SIP7ZS", "B000065U1N", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B000095WW8", "B000U7169M", "B00DHHWXYY", "B000GFLKF8", "B004SIP8ZM", "B002O3Z510", "B002VWNIEA", "B002ZG99N6", "B0007DFJ0G", "B005LAIIJY", "0792839137", "B000KP62SE", "B000P0J0EW", "B000P0J09M", "B007SPPANM", "B00004XPPG", "B000C20VPA", "B00011CZRE", "B002QEHPQU", "B00005JN2Z", "B00AEBB9CS", "B00003CXWV", "B00AEFY5B6", "B00001ZWUS", "B00H9KKGTO", "B00005JN0W", "B002T9H2LA", "B000MTEFXC", "B003L20IG0", "B00AEBB86A", "B00005JKBC", "B0013XZ2QK", "B0000ACOXL", "B005LAIGRS", "B002AT8K9W", "B0007KIFGE", "B00AZNEW5G", "B003ASLJO0", "B000T28PII", "B002DU39GW", "B002ZG97RE", "B000LC55F2", "B00003CXTG", "B00AEBBA36", "B00B0U2SFE", "B003ASLJQI", "B002CPMB9O", "B00BB67UNW", "B000MXPE7O", "0783231202", "B000FVQLQQ", "B00AEFXVCU", "B00AEFXRRO", "B000A3XY5A", "B002JCSWV6", "B00005JNQA", "B004EPYZP8", "B0050MB4OO", "B000P0J0AG", "B000C65Z1G", "B00275EGWY", "B00005B6JZ", "B0006GANPA", "B00AEBB9NM", "B002XMGGK6", "B000C20VRS", "B0007P0XBO", "B003UESJME", "B000QXDED6", "B00AHTYI5M", "B001P9KR8U", "B004A8ZX28", "B008JFUNKU", "B003ASLJQS", "B002VWNICC", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00005BCKF", "B000NOIX48"], "bought_together": ["B000M341QE", "B002ZG980U"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AEBB8NI", "B00H9KKGTO", "B008MILL8W", "B000BYA5G4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 106777}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.96, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00005JPGO", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61MN8-6skUL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Blood Diamond (Two-Disc Special Edition)"}

In fact, his eye-opening biography of 18th century abolitionist William Wilberforce (Ioan Gruffudd) is likely to come as a revelation to many Britons, as well. After all, despite the presence of his wife, Barbara (Romola Garai), this isn't a particularly \"sexy\" story, but itisa powerful one. The title comes from John Newton's hymn \"Amazing Grace\" (\"I once was lost but now am found\"). Newton (Albert Finney) was a former slaveholder, who became a clergyman and spent his days repenting. While America had John Brown, England had Wilberforce, and Newton is one of many who helped the MP to abolish slavery in the UK. The story begins towards the end of Wilberforce's mission when he's sick with colitis and addicted to laudanum. Apted continues to alternate between 1797 and 1789, when Wilberforce was fitter and more idealistic, and ends in 1807 as his efforts come to fruition. Apted and writer Steven Knight (Dirty Pretty Things) do right by their hero. UnlikeAmistad, however, slaves are largely off-screen, with the exception of author Equiano (Senegalese vocalist Youssou N'Dour).Amazing Gracereserves its focus for the politicians who risked their reps for the greater good, like Wilberforce and Prime Minister Pitt (an excellent Benedict Cumberbatch), and those more concerned with the income slavery provided their constituents, like Lord Tarleton (Ciar&#xE1;n Hinds) and the Duke of Clarence (Toby Jones).--Kathleen C.

{"description": "In 1928, when Walt Disney's artists completed \"The Skeleton Dance,\" the  distributor of the Mickey Mouse shorts rejected the first \"Silly Symphony\"  with a two-word telegram: \"MORE MICE.\" Disney arranged to screen \"Skeleton  Dance\" at the Carthay Circle Theater in Los Angeles, where it received an  enthusiastic response, and the series took off. Seven \"Silly Symphonies\" won  Academy Awards, beginning with \"Flowers and Trees.\" Disney used these  musically themed shorts to train young artists and test new styles, effects,   and technologies: every film represented an innovation of some sort. In  \"Three Little Pigs,\" characters who looked alike demonstrated different  personalities through the way they moved. \"The Old Mill\" showcased the  newly invented Multiplane camera. The Sugar Cookie Girl in \"Cookie Carnival\"  was one of several female characters the artists created while learning to  animate a believable heroine forSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs. The  well-chosen selections in this set demonstrate how quickly Disney advanced  the art of animation during the '30s. Only eight years separate the crude  black-and-white version of \"The Ugly Duckling\" (1931) from the moving  Technicolor Oscar-winner of 1939. Over 60 years later, these films have lost  none of their charm. The jazz-dancing insects in \"Woodland Caf&#xE9;,\" the  wonderfully animated caricature of Mae West in \"Who Killed Cock Robin,\" and  the instrument-characters in \"Music Land\" remain as delightful as ever.  Leonard Maltin makes a genial host, and two hidden cartoons include Walt's  introductions from the oldDisneylandprogram.--Charles Solomon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000ICM5R6", "B00005KARD", "B000ATQYUG", "B0002S64UA", "B00006II6O", "B00006II6N", "B0000BWVAG", "B0000BWVAF", "B000ATQYU6", "B00006II6P", "B000VE4UCO", "B0002S64UU", "B0000BWVAH", "B0000BWVAI", "B000ICM5QM", "B00005KARE", "B000VE4UC4", "B001DPHDC4", "B0000687E3", "B00005KARG", "B00004R99B", "B00004R99D", "B0006J289G", "B00004R99H", "B000ICM5RG", "B000VE4UCE", "6305472408", "6305472424", "B001ED3JEQ", "B001SSHPH4", "B000R7GKPU", "B0012RLXBU", "B0002S64UK", "B00004R99Y", "B0006J288M", "B001PK47GC", "B0029R81BC", "B000P296AS", "B0011XFOIS", "B001GNG2WU", "B001U3N3QY", "B0062KMDWU", "B000ATQYUQ", "B0040JHNAW", "B001DPHDCO", "B002H047OG", "B00020SK1Y", "B0007PIDB6", "B0081LTIJE", "B0029R81BM", "B001ILFUDC", "B001CUBF6A", "B000I2J6OG", "B005FQ1ONG", "B00EFYB03S", "B000A2X0KU", "B000GG4XWE", "B005NFJAQC", "B00267N3F4", "B0007PIDBG", "B000BQ7JVG", "B001RTKKNA", "B00005RDST", "B00838HSYM", "B00JDCP0QA", "B001B23ED6", "B00006RCLC", "B008N8A3JE", "B001RTKKMQ", "B001DPHDCE", "B00000ICR4", "B001RTKKN0", "B000ATQYV0", "B004176JHQ", "B001ANHYCI", "B0009OUAZW", "B001PK47H6", "B00CUKTGSA", "B00005K9OE", "B00E9ZAT4Y", "B00AF4OTM6", "B003TVTRYC", "B003H9M1QM", "B00007CVS8", "B00BTJTYB2", "B004AKCMES", "B00002VWE0", "B000I2J6MS", "B006FE83T0", "B003TVTRYM", "B00CMY3JBO", "B000GETTIE", "B000ZOXDK0", "B003H9M1Q2", "B001PK47GW", "B00GDT4M1A", "B0014VPFHW", "B000ADS62G", "0763631736", "B00C7A8WWO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000ATQYUG", "B00004R99B", "B0002S64UA", "B00005KARD"]}, "price": 44.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 77579}, "asin": "B00005KARF", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/415B0A4TK5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Walt Disney Treasures - Silly Symphonies"}

In fact, instead of receiving a gold watch for his years of faithful service, our hero (played by Patrick McGoohan) is followed home to his London flat and knocked unconscious. When he awakens, he finds himself in a picturesque village where everyone is known by a number. Where is it? Why was he brought here? And, most important, how does he leave?As we learn in Episode 1, Number 6 can't leave. The Village's \"citizens\" might dress colorfully and stroll around its manicured gardens while a band plays bouncy Strauss marches, but the place is actually a prison. Surveillance is near total, and if all else fails, there's always the large, mysterious white ball that subdues potential escapees by temporarily smothering them. Who runs the Village? An ever-changing Number 2, who wants to know why Number 6 resigned. If he'd only cooperate, he's told, life can be made very pleasant. \"I've resigned,\" he fumes. \"I will not be pushed, filed, stamped, indexed, briefed, debriefed, or numbered. My life is my own.\" So sets the stage for the ultimate battle of wills: Number 6's struggle to retain his privacy, sanity, and individuality against the array of psychological and physical methods the Village uses to break him.So does he ever escape? And does he ever find out who Number 1 is? \"Questions are a burden to others,\" the Village saying goes. \"Answers, a prison for oneself.\" Within this complete 17-episode set (which contains the entire series), all is revealed. Or is it?--Steve Landau", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000KLQUT4", "B00E5G03I4", "B002U0KHNS", "B00KTZALDC", "B00005JM5Z", "B00CPTUNR4", "0446387444", "B0000A14WG", "B000NOIX66", "0956632920", "B001CQONOA", "B0000AZKJ8", "B001B0H7DG", "B003K1NGXE", "B005JJCMNU", "B005DKS1Z8", "B008MIYKS0", "B0007CEXUY", "B000UX6TJI", "B0012EBV8I", "B008X8VM1W", "B00CPR3RB0", "B0014BQR3I", "B001DW2BG0", "B001WLMOL4", "B00005JNU5", "B00IO998U2", "B000UX6TKC", "B00005JP4N", "B001HUHBBS", "B000HT3PF6", "B00E96AY20", "B000EXDS2A", "B00EC9UHVM", "B0027EZS90", "B00000IREA", "B006MFQ4OS", "B002L9N4E2", "B00105307O", "B003NOGNQU", "B00264QI68", "B000LE16Y4", "B00144P9RA", "B001DHXT6G", "B0002F6BSS", "B000E991A2", "B000H5U5EE", "B00IS6WQ2S", "B0028S110K", "B001LMAK6A", "B0001MZ7J6", "B002LFPAUC", "B000ERVJKO", "B004132HZS", "B00F6D62O4", "B00CDEJRDC", "B004VW4VAI", "B00114XLZK", "B0009XRZ92", "B0002MHDW4", "B001J710Y8", "B00C6ACWLC", "B001C71IGA", "B000T9OP7G", "B000FIHN8O", "B004L9GMBC", "B00E3UN44W", "B000ZBEOHY", "B000BZISS0", "B000ATQYWY", "B0009JE6G6", "B008B37CB8", "B003ZEQMH8", "B001XRLWLU", "B000055Y0X", "B0006UEVTK", "B004QOB8SO", "B00F3L8P26", "B006JY3OHW", "B002OID4T0", "B001GMH8WE", "B001MVWMD4", "B000V3JGIS", "B00AMSTXSU", "B0003JAOO0", "B00005JKEX", "B000RPD0DM", "B00AEBB8VK", "B002Q3MYA8", "B001DHXT48", "B00EJ1IT4A", "B00BMJ7ZKG", "B004PQM81E", "B00HT2RTU6", "B005X4P3DC", "B002LFQIL2", "B00AZMFJYA", "B008FTX6PO", "B0027CSMY0", "B00026L7OU"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00E5G03I4", "B00004Y7DZ", "B001DHXT6G", "B002U0KHNS"]}, "price": 179.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 163816}, "asin": "B00005NKCQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515RHT85P1L._SX300_.jpg", "title": "The Complete Prisoner Megaset"}

His body is in a neighboring town; the young man's mother insists that it be brought back on foot, lest his spirit not find his way home. From this starting point, the young man recounts the tale of his parents' courtship, which involved a red banner, mushroom dumplings, a colorful barrette, and a broken bowl.The Road Homeis beautifully filmed, particularly the luminous face of Zhang Ziyi (fromCrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon), whose performance is a heartrending portrait of hope and yearning.

{"description": "Retelling a story that has made it onto the silver screen more than most, this latest adaptation of The Count of Monte Cristo makes yet another swashbuckling attempt to win over a new generation of cinema goers. A dashing James Caviezel takes the role of the Count, who is driven by a desire for revenge after being betrayed by his best friend Fernand (played by a dishevelled Guy Pearce) and landed with 16 years of solitary confinement in Chateau D'If, a damp cavernous prison. Thus the scene is set for a good old-fashioned romp. The trouble with this \"re-imagining\" (to borrow a phrase from Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes) is that it's never quite sure whether to take itself seriously or not. Alexandre Dumas's original story is a traditionally melodramatic tale of deceit and double-crossing, with clear-cut bad guys and a moral lesson to be learned at the end. Here, director Kevin Reynolds appears unsure about whether to stick with tradition or bring the story up to date and turn it into a post-modern play on the old Victorian values and style. When the Count and his heavy-breathing loved one are reunited, their kiss is actually framed as a cameo. Both lead actors are also prone to heavy bouts of overacting, garnishing their performances with exaggerated baroque gestures. Clearly this is a film in which the actors could over-indulge themselves and (almost) get away with it, were it not for the fact that--bar Richard Harris as the \"Priest\"--none of them seem to have the faintest idea about how to conduct themselves in a period drama. This Count of Monte Cristo will leave the audience a little confused as to whether they should cry along with the story or laugh along with the actors. --Nikki Disney On the DVD: The Count of Monte Cristo on disc offers no escape from the dry drawl of director Kevin Reynolds, who features in almost every element of the extensive extras package.

{"description": "Even thoughThe Laramie Projecthas been edited down from almost three hours (the original length of the play) to a lean 96 minutes, the harrowing nature of the subject matter--the brutal murder of Matthew Shepard--and the clarity of the voices of the inhabitants of Laramie, Wyoming, give this film a remarkable emotional power.The Laramie Projectwas created from over 200 interviews conducted with Laramie residents before, during, and after the trials of the two boys who killed Shepard; the interviews create an amazing cross-section of American views on homosexuality, religion, class, privacy, and so much more besides. Even though it features an all-star cast--Steve Buscemi, Janeane Garofalo, Christina Ricci, Peter Fonda, and Laura Linney are only a few of the recognizable faces--the material has not been glamorized and the performances are both honest and intimate. Even abbreviated, it's a remarkable piece of work.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B003IG06PM", "082222450X", "0375727191", "B00E99FYOK", "1594630577", "0452296382", "B004AR4W4O", "B0001I2BUI", "B002Y3GZD2", "B001QUF3SW", "1586422146", "B006QVRVW2", "B000QJM90E", "B00003CWN3", "B000YHQNCI", "B00A92MGLA", "B00005AQMJ", "B0027BOL4Q", "B00EU8RB14", "B000ETRCMQ", "0800141806", "0763658073", "1555839010", "B00009MEB8", "B0000JD29M", "B0000DIJNJ", "B000I2J6Y6", "B00E32PJFC", "B00GHP8SH4", "B00JAOW3MA", "B00008UALE", "B00HW3F1IO", "B000BYW6RA", "B0002I84JO", "B0007SL31U", "B0001HAGRE", "B004GFGUDQ", "B0000639HT", "B00E849QSG", "B00CEJVNEM", "B000BZISX0", "B00005JOFQ", "B003BR8ME0", "B00I4CWIVU", "B00FGBR5S8", "B007OXB1GI", "B005S9EIGU", "B003L20ICE", "B00F98FOPE", "B00DUJH94S", "B001Y7CVXC", "B000053V7G", "B003LR5BBC", "B000053VAW", "B001EUSYIA", "B00996RSYM", "B007OXB1H2", "B00008R9KD", "B00HHYF5EI", "B00DW5IJR6", "B00IBQ5M1W", "B00005QAQD", "B00005V5NU", "B00D2CYU2W", "B00004U104", "B00005YUP1", "B00FGG60XY", "B0013D8LCW", "B000CRR3I8", "B00GSBMNOQ", "0231118597", "B00JM5CAHA", "B0096UG7XY", "B0000714BP", "B00COBWXIK", "B001451HV6", "B004YCKKH8", "B00EPH8SBM", "0062511238", "B000067IYK", "B001CQONPE", "B004SIP71M", "B0034PHWJ0", "B00A4TMLKE", "B00B2DGYQS", "B00026L9CU", "B0055HOIMY", "B0013D8LNG", "B00I567EWS", "B00HUQCA28", "B0042KZJFA", "B0001EFUFK", "B002VECLVO", "B007TBJUVS", "B000A3XY5A", "B000J4QWIG", "B00160ANUA", "B000A7Q2I2", "B008JFX04G", "B0000AYJV8"], "bought_together": ["B003IG06PM", "B00E99FYOK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003IG06PM", "B00E99FYOK", "0375727191", "B0001I2BUI"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 76226}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 6.72, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B000067D0Y", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51-urXK0XEL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Laramie Project"}

{"description": "Jackie Chan returns to dazzling form! If you've watched Chan's Hollywood  movies (Rush Hour,Shanghai Noon) and been unimpressed,The Accidental Spyis a good introduction to the astonishing fights  and extraordinary stunts that make Chan's Hong Kong films such events.  Chan plays an exercise-equipment salesman who turns out to be the missing  son of a Korean double agent who's connected with drug lords in Turkey who  have developed a super-addictive opium--got all that? The plot is largely  nonsensical, a series of implausible escapades that frame the action; but  what the movie lacks in logic, it makes up for in spectacle, ranging from  a burning runaway truck cascading off a bridge to a stark-naked Chan  pursued by thugs in a Turkish bazaar, defending himself with every  implement in sight.

{"description": "Kids will love this sweeping story of two brothers whose plane crashes on a mysterious island called Dinotopia, where human beings live in harmony with dinosaurs--the herbivores, anyway. The carnivores present a problem, as the humans' defenses against them--a mystical power source called sunstones--are losing strength. As they try to save the island, Carl and David (Tyron Leitso and Wentworth Miller) struggle not only with tyrannosaurs and prehistoric crocodiles, but also with repressive Dinotopian traditions and a scheming malcontent (David Thewlis) who stirs up all kinds of trouble. Meanwhile, they also wrestle with each other over the lovely daughter of the mayor of Waterfall City (Katie Carr). The pacifist ideals ofDinotopiaare refreshing, but it's the special effects that will hook viewers: riding on the backs of brachiosaurs, flying atop pteranadons, arguing in court with triceratops and  ankylosaurs--anyone fascinated with dinosaurs (and who isn't?) will enjoy this whimsical fantasy. A host of British character actors also helps keep the human side of this four-hour miniseries lively; Alice Krige (also known as the Borg Queen inStar Trek: The Next Generation) gets a much more benevolent role here.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000YEE6W", "B0007OP1HQ", "B00A2XQTV4", "0740764314", "1606600222", "1570361649", "B00B04NIZO", "1606600575", "B0000648XE", "B0010X744G", "1606600338", "B000050MN3", "B004LROMS4", "1878685899", "0679869816", "B0031DDG9A", "B00008AOWU", "0060518510", "B000089G5O", "B00005RDSQ", "B00005UW87", "B007J3ISKK", "0060280050", "B00C3OX0H6", "B003G715Q2", "B00ECXJC28", "B00IJJBHW4", "B004QSQMJ0", "B00GTZWZH6", "B003RHZ6IE", "B001CIOCP8", "B001B7CNZG", "B000031EGV", "B00HZMZ2HM", "B00077BPA0", "B000EHSVPK", "B000A6T1ZE", "B00005COWD", "B001RXDM1I", "B00AYV9U8I", "B0057FGD3Q", "B008L0YMVE", "B00152VVQY", "B009MO57H6", "B00BUNQPZK", "B00005JLR2", "B006JN87WK", "B000WDTO8E", "0441009212", "B0009ETCXS", "B008JFUS0U", "B003KW7CQ0", "B00153ZR8G", "B0083VP2KQ", "1570362793", "B001FT4LTQ", "0783225520", "0679869824", "B00008RUYH", "B0000640T0", "B0013XZ6MU", "B0041KKBFE", "B000R8YC2W", "B0007R4T1W", "B000B7HZQY", "B003MX91H0", "B00CAYH23M", "B002GY9F9K", "6305922675", "1878685465", "B001MVYUQG", "B0007OCG5Q", "B003L77GWE", "B00BNAE14W", "0783225547", "B00BEZTMFY", "B0013LRKY4", "B002BWP2IK", "B000E8NRVC", "B00F8PTBLQ", "B001THIQFO", "B000NOIX7U", "B004P7CMUU", "B00AEFZ6V4", "B0046BI81W", "B0087ZG7NO", "B000CZ0PNK", "B000N4SA8M", "B00017LVSM", "B001NPD9JK", "B0000AOX0O", "B0007DA3VG", "B003BV8I7C", "B004GJYRA0", "B000K7UBX4", "B007C8RZBK", "B005PPMHO2", "B004JFHQQ8", "B002ZG98UA", "B00CFA222M"], "bought_together": ["B0007OP1HQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00A2XQTV4", "B0000YEE6W", "B0007OP1HQ", "B00B04NIZO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 17808}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 56.99, "brand": "LION&#39;S GATE ENTERTAINMENT", "asin": "B0000687CX", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/519BC9CDCVL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Dinotopia (TV Miniseries)"}
{"description": "From the studio that brought you REMEMBER THE TITANS comes an inspirational film based on a true story. Jim Morris (Dennis Quaid), father, teacher, and high school coach, thought his dream was over. He'd had his shot playing baseball, blew out his shoulder, and retired without ever making it to the big leagues. Then, in 1999, Coach Morris made a fateful bet with his perpetually losing team. If they won the district championship, Morris -- who threw a 98 mph fastball -- would try out for the majors. The team went from worst to first, and Jim, living up to his end of the bargain, threw caution to the wind and was on the road to becoming the oldest rookie in the major leagues. This heartfelt, uplifting story about not giving up on your dreams is a remarkable and affecting story that will have everyone cheering.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0068FZ0GK", "B000MNOX94", "B004X2TYG2", "B0000633U2", "B0012YYZDG", "B0007LLPXI", "B00005M20J", "B00009AOAX", "0792843592", "B000J3OTT6", "0800177258", "B00AEFXHNI", "B0010YSD90", "B000056VP4", "B00004W221", "B000069I1K", "B00028HBES", "B005SQRYEG", "B0001US66Y", "B00DW5IKW0", "B00005JPBO", "B000EXZFCQ", "B0000524E4", "B00DNF1SSC", "B000MNOX9E", "B0036APHRC", "B00AATUZLU", "B0007LLPWO", "B000FOPPDI", "B008H6GHHY", "B001KRCDT8", "B004GJYRF0", "B000FTCLRG", "B0019ESNG4", "B000CNFC76", "B00F3LSXPA", "B003VE9WTW", "B00720ONHM", "B00004TJQJ", "B0000DZTNB", "B0008JIJ2E", "B000X5RBXG", "B0002WZTOI", "6305428387", "B0006FYOTC", "B004DK5CW4", "B00008EY60", "B00009AVA4", "B001LXIDVI", "B00006SFL7", "B001BSBBF8", "B000KLQUS0", "B004J713LK", "B00BFE33SQ", "6305428352", "B00E1HIWTO", "0783225733", "B00008O38G", "B000065V42", "B00005JKVU", "B0087F7VSY", "B000068QPY", "B007TGOJLE", "B001YV504U", "B000YGGNMO", "B000P0J09W"], "bought_together": ["B0068FZ0GK", "B000MNOX94"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0068FZ0GK", "B004X2TYG2", "B000J3OTT6", "B0007LLPXI"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 105793}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.5, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B000068DBE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510YP5SNYNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Rookie (Widescreen Edition)"}

We will all come home together.&rdquo; This heroic true story of commitment, courage and sacrifice also stars Madeline Stowe, Greg Kinnear, Sam Elliott, Chris Klein, Keri Russell and Barry Pepper.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000065U1N", "B0015D20FE", "B00001ZWUS", "B00005JK8K", "079284646X", "B000M4RG42", "B00004XPPG", "B000P0J09C", "B004U7MQWY", "B00AEFXVCU", "B00003CXTG", "B000095WW8", "B00005PJ8T", "0679411585", "B003ELKNH2", "B005LAIGYQ", "B003ASLJOU", "B00006CXSS", "B00HEPE6MM", "B000ELL1R6", "B00AEFXRRO", "B00AMSLDTM", "0345472640", "B00005JPKE", "B00275EGWY", "B006TTC5HC", "0792839730", "B00AEBB86U", "B00005PJ8S", "B0002V7ON8", "B001IBIHQ4", "B000B8QG22", "B00319ECI8", "B0007TKNGA", "B00B0U2SFE", "B000EHSVSC", "B000P0J0EW", "B00AEFXKUI", "B00AZNEW5G", "B000O599YO", "B00AEFY0F2", "B005LAIGN2", "B002O3Z4Z2", "0800177967", "B00AEBB86A", "B00HX7DFXC", "6304765258", "B00005N5S3", "B00000G3PA", "B004AOECXI", "B002O3Z510", "B007HCI42A", "B000DZIGDU", "B00AEFY5B6", "B0000TANUI", "B00003CXA6", "0782010040", "B000LAZE8C", "B000W1SZBS", "6304711905", "B004O8LETK", "B00003CXHJ", "B0007KIFGE", "B002O3Z50Q", "B002GHHHPQ", "006114777X", "B00005JA9F", "B00008K76U", "B000JLTRIQ", "B003ASLJO0", "B000XR9L50", "B0042KZJIC", "1558908315", "B001XSCRKO", "B00A34LX2M", "B0001NBMGC", "B00AEFYBA6", "0792841670", "B00005B6JZ", "B00AEBB9NM", "B0001WTWWE", "0792838041", "B00000JDIQ", "B00BY0EBK0", "B0007TKNM4", "B003U0AHBO", "B00ARWXJ54", "B0007TKNDI", "B0002WZTOI", "B004TPJN3C", "B000M341QE", "B000WMA6R8", "B00005PJ8K", "034547581X", "B00024JC4E", "B000A2WJBQ", "B00ALCBTWU", "B00005JNTI", "B0001FGC1U"], "bought_together": ["B00001ZWUS", "B000065U1N"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00001ZWUS", "0679411585", "B000065U1N", "B00006CXSS"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 41392}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.45, "brand": "Paramount", "asin": "B000068TPN", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RtP2kk1TL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "We Were Soldiers (Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "Rainer Werner Fassbinder adapted his own play for this modern twist onThe Women, the great all-female Hollywood classic of sex and social conventions in high society. Margit Carstensen is successful dress designer Petra, Irm Hermann her silent, obedient secretary/servant/Girl Friday Marlene (whom she alternately abuses and ignores), and Hanna Schygulla the callow, shallow young Karin, a seemingly naive blond beauty Petra treats as part proteg&#xE9;e, part pet, until the calculating kitten turns on Petra. Michael Ballhaus's prowling camera finds Marlene silently hovering on the borders of Petra's dramas, looking on through doors and windows like an adoring lover from afar. Bouncing between catty melodrama and naked emotional need, it's a quintessentially Fassbinder portrait of doomed love, jealousy, and social taboos. The DVD features commentary by Fassbinder scholar Jane Shattuc, the early 1966 Fassbinder short filmsThe City TrampandThe Little Chaos, the bonus documentaryRainer Werner Fassbinder, and filmographies.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000065AZ9", "B000FVGNSM", "B000065AZB", "B0009WIE8Y", "B00008L3WC", "B000FWGYU8", "B00008V2UE", "B00008L3WU", "B00CUKTHDO", "B003D3Y64C", "B00006ADES", "B008CJ0JS4", "B0068CEGFY", "B0002KPHTW", "B00006LPCZ", "B000093NQY", "B0000AKY56", "B0002VEVDO", "B005D0RDWK", "B00007M5HB", "B00031TYGW", "B00008V2UH", "B00006IUHC", "B0000C2IV9", "B00005Y8UH", "B000EHQU30", "B000127IF2", "B0009WIE7U", "B00006FD9X", "781136249X", "7885729117", "B004RBC5PG", "1572525835", "B002LEZ2NI", "B00062134E", "1572524839", "B00014K5Y6", "B00006LPCY", "B006GVNHUM", "B0001ZIYDO", "B000EHQU3A", "B000068MAL", "B00005KH2D", "B0008FXSTM", "B0000B1A5P", "B003MRVJZI", "B000GRU8TK", "B000EQ5V2C", "B0007WFYC0", "B004RBC5JW", "B00005B1ZK", "B001PYZA78", "B00008V2UC", "B00005JXY5", "B00CN70IZ0", "B0063E00KW", "B0000AZKJW", "B003ICZW7S", "B0013D8LY0", "B0007OC6ZG", "B00000JJHK", "B007RUZ2M2", "B0087ICF50", "B00A2FHTSY", "B000053VBL", "B005VHVS0I", "B000WMFZME", "B00005NC68", "B000056EWF", "B000053VBO", "B000LW7L04"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000FVGNSM", "B004RBC5JW", "0933826826", "B000FWGYU8"]}, "price": 27.74, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 261052}, "asin": "B00006IUHE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510K1T48GCL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Bitter Tears of Petra Von Kant"}

Series creator Joel Hodgson's participation is relegated to season 2'sCatalina Caper, a fan favorite that at one time was pulled from circulation over rights issues. As with most of Rhino'sMST3KDVDs, each disc is dual-sided, with one side devoted to the original, uncut version of each film, and the other given over to the \"MSTied\" version. Theatrical trailers for each movie round out the remainder of the supplemental features.

{"description": "Tales from the Deepincludes all nine episodes from the VHS  releasesBikini Bottom BashandDeep Sea Sillies. In the double-episode that begins this compilation of the Nickelodeon animated underwater  series, SpongeBob buys a party planning kit. The porous party giver annoys his  guests by scheduling their every second, until he accidentally gets locked out  and the real party begins. Meanwhile, above sea level in an unfunny live-action  segment, Patchy the Pirate hosts a revelry, forcing a marionette band to walk  the plank, among other obnoxious gags. Back under the sea in the second episode,  SpongeBob takes his hall monitor duties too seriously, directing traffic and  disrupting life in Bikini Bottom. Next, following a sand-sledding accident that  requires 20 hours of surgery, the boy sponge is so traumatized that he becomes  housebound until a gorilla goes ape on Patrick and Sandy. Finally, SpongeBob  plans a huge Valentine's Day surprise for Patrick, but a band of  chocolate-eating mollusks delays delivery, inciting the seastar to throw a dangerous  tantrum.In  an undersea version of \"Green Eggs and Ham,\" the persistent boy sponge discovers  Squidward has never tasted a krabby patty and hounds him until an addiction is  born. The patties are featured again in the final episode when restaurant owner  Krabs insists on trying to sell a spoiled sandwich. Since no one will bite,  Krabs does, leading to a near-death experience. In between, the tenacious sponge  and his seastar sidekick Patrick lure aging superheroes Mermaid Man and Barnacle  Boy (guest-voiced by Ernest Borgnine and Tim Conway) out of retirement to  vanquish a maniac. In the remaining two stories, the \"little square dude\" has  fun with a gum wrapper and later nearly suffocates in the air-filled home of  Sandy the squirrel. Best for ages 4-12, but nothing more objectionable than  vomit humor for younger siblings.--Kimberly Heinrichs", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00006IJJB", "B00007LP8P", "B00009N84F", "B00005JN55", "B0002V7OJ2", "B000068TPP", "B00005V1XM", "B005UPOBU0", "B0000AI42B", "B00064VQXK", "B0000E32X0", "B0001O3W3M", "B000127LXG", "B0087MN90Q", "B000GTLB7Q", "B008VECJA6", "B009R5H688", "B0000C2IQB", "B000F9T6ZG", "B000B5XOVG", "B000BYRCDS", "B000A0GP1S", "B000NOK0NK", "B0002JP58Q", "B003SLEDHY", "B004GTVU6Y", "B000A6CLKQ", "B0090W3BNM", "B005MQ58WW", "B0090W3BPA", "B00ALTQRFC", "B000XCZGWW", "B0090W3BOG", "B0007Y08OC", "B0011NVCB6", "B001HUHBCW", "B0042RJWT2", "B00HJQMDQC", "B00FWJM7TQ", "B006OKOW8G", "B002OID50S", "B00274SIWO", "B005ARYD0G", "B002DYJTVW", "B005JZ2XG0", "B0000UJLGO", "B001BN4WKO", "B001DHXT6Q", "B000ION73A", "B000M343C6", "B000UAE7W2", "B00E20STAW", "B000QUEQ8G", "B004V2S4S8", "B008QPBTME", "B008KEQMCS", "B001MVWMHU", "B001R5GAJM", "B007ZXW3S2", "B000RMJ4F8", "B000JRCXU4", "B003IB0FUI", "B002VJ05DU", "B00005NVDH", "B006OUNJ80", "B00I6JOD2S", "B0000CABKY", "B000FZETKM", "B006SFUD30", "B00FWVXRLG", "B00009RDG2", "B002VJ05D0", "B0000UJLXM", "B006O51WH0", "B002L9N4Y2", "B0007Y08OM", "B004P90PC0", "B000LH1CLI", "B001R3YRIA", "B00FI1QXTS", "B004X1M4FG", "B005775M22", "B000QXDG52", "B0030Y129G", "B002ZG97F6", "B000083C6V", "B0006FO8JI", "B000A6T1IQ", "B004OWQTUK", "B000O5Z0II", "B00007G1ZN", "B000BITUXE", "B007IUEDJO", "B00765VVDC", "B008RFXCP0", "B004NXG9IC", "B004IK30Q4", "B000IFRT2O", "B002BUUKP2"], "bought_together": ["B00005JN55"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00078DWV4", "B00006IJJB", "B0000C2IQB", "B0090W3BPA"]}, "price": 7.5, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 72983}, "asin": "B00007AJFJ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZEEKQT6DL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Spongebob SquarePants - Tales From the Deep"}

{"description": "Dirk Bogarde risked his career to make this 1962 film about a lawyer who risks his career to stand up to blackmailers. Part crime thriller and part plea for tolerance,Victimuses the terror of a blackmailing ring to point out the injustice of Britain's antisodomy laws. Bogarde plays Melville Farr, a married lawyer who learns of a blackmail scheme when one of its victims, an old friend, commits suicide rather than tell the police. As Farr conducts an investigation, he must confront his own past.Victimwas ahead of its time--it was the first English-language movie to use the word \"homosexual\"--and as such it seems quaint and stilted at times. Straw-man clich&#xE9;s about homosexuality must be knocked down, and, like in all first-wave issue movies, occasionally characters need to have rather stilted debates. Still, the crime plot stands on its own, the performances are excellent, and the film is brave enough to make some very good points.

And while the movie has its flaws (it contains references to \"Bwana George\" and such that would be considered frightfully un-PC nowadays), the animal footage, especially that of the lions in their various stages of development, is extraordinary and timelessly entertaining. DVD bonus features are limited to theatrical trailers, but the digitally remastered film can be viewed in both widescreen and full screen.

{"description": "Season 2 ofFelicitynot only sees the massacre of star Keri Russell's golden locks (at one point, a minor character refers to the new, short-cropped Felicity as \"Chia-Head\") but endless turmoil--most of it quite addictive to watch--in perhaps seven or eight overlapping romances.First there's the issue of season 1's cliffhanger. Did Felicity spend her summer with former high-school crush Ben (Scott Speedman) or her dormitory's resident advisor, Noel (Scott Foley), who harbors strong feelings for her? Episode 1 teases us with the answer while laying the bumpy groundwork for our heroine's sophomore year: Felicity has come back to college in New York City as an R.A. in her old dorm, once again sharing a room--much to her discontent--with acerbic Wiccan-punk Meghan (Amanda Foreman). Ben has a part-time job working in a coffee shop owned by Felicity's confidante Javier (Ian Gomez). Noel is sharing an apartment with another Felicity ally, Elena (Tangi Miller), as well as filmmaker Sean (Greg Grunberg), who previously made a documentary focusing on Ben and Felicity's relationship.Tangled connections and shifting loyalties make for a long, involving second year in this drama-comedy from Disney and Imagine Entertainment. Characters fall in and out of love, earn and betray trust, leap before they look, and redeem themselves with powerful acts of forgiveness or faith.Felicitycreators J.J. Abrams (writer,Forever Young) and Matt Reeves (director,Relativity) set out to capture the unique contradictions of young adulthood in this show--in particular, clinging to a precise college track while trying to make sense of post-adolescent love and responsibility--and for the most part succeed very well. Sometimes too well: The storylines may become a little redundant, the drama a tad flat with such singular interest in the muddled passions of 19-year-olds. But each episode is sharply written, comically incisive, and never less than watchable.Great special features: Keri Russell's audition, audio commentaries, a never-before-seen pilot, and theFelicityEmmy Parody, i.e., a spoof of the TV show produced for an Emmy Award telecast.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0077PTWY6", "B00BGQ2NIO", "B00BGQ2NDO", "B0006J28DM", "B000TGURZ8", "B0001IN0T4", "B002KQ6UE2", "B000FUTVPA", "B00369ERC4", "B0056GLNQI", "B005CGI3ZG", "B0077PTX0E", "B0058EE6OO", "B0077PTWH8", "B0016OOM6W", "B004GJYRFA", "B0077PTWX2", "B003INBNV6", "B00BMKGZVA", "B001RHGRU2", "B0081QF6Q8", "B003R0MF6W", "B00127RAGM", "B00000IP8T", "B000F3UAE8", "B001ULCY48", "B001UHOWYM", "B000U1ZV2G", "B000LXH3SI", "B0009A407A", "B000NOKFGW", "B000BNXD6O", "B005DCJ0Q0", "B004MWLXTY", "B0001EQHXO", "B000N3T0EG", "B004WO9OMA", "B0011UBDS6", "B0030VANIU", "B00008AOX3", "B002ZTQW3S", "B00HEQOAIQ", "B0018CWF02", "B00ADQDTPE", "B001FB5TAY", "B003L77G56", "B00005JPII", "B003F3NE7K", "B00L9OPOSO", "B003L77G42", "B0018CWEVW", "B001VPJYZU", "B003LXM1PK", "B001OQCVCE", "B001DZOCVO", "B003QZSWRY", "B000P6YNT8", "B000R7HRRA", "B008L0YMWS", "B0058YPIF0", "B000065CVV", "B001RXDM2C", "B004M9ZI0C", "B002AK9UOK", "B00ECGHM5O", "B00A8KJN8M", "B003L77GCE", "B0050MB5P2", "B002AMVEEM", "B0006FFRBG", "B0024FAD7O", "B000FL7CAK", "B001CDKQ8K", "B00005JNAF", "B009LDD4V4", "B0041KKYI8", "B005CA4SOM", "B0007V6IW6", "B002KQ6UDS", "B0002234R2", "B000FS9MY2", "B0032UYFAQ", "B00CKJJ1G8", "B00DXLO086", "B000NA2BEU", "B00CKJJ1IG", "B00KM5F31O", "B00DXLO0D6", "B00B1LKXV8", "B00133QNS6", "B00561BNI6", "B000GFLEKY", "B001MVWRNE", "B004ZG5F0K", "B0002RQ3MK", "B000OCXNQW", "B002AMVEJ2", "B0051GOB2G", "B001MVYUP2", "B0031DMU5Q"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0077PTWY6", "B000TGURZ8", "B00369ERC4", "B00BMKGZVA"]}, "price": 1.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 148055}, "asin": "B00008GQ33", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51FR4M3NXRL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Felicity - Sophomore Year Collection (The Complete Second Season)"}

Her transformation from doormat to vengeful prom queen remains surefire wish fulfillment for anyone who ever felt a misfit in high school.

{"description": "Packed with nearly six hours of historical material,The Last Days of the Civil Warprovides a fascinating study of a nation in the painful throes of transition. The five History Channel programs compiled here effectively combine to form a multifaceted account of the pivotal events of 1864-65, when the bloodshed of civil war slowly brought forth a government (in the words of President Abraham Lincoln) \"of the people by the people for the people,\" that would define the United States as it progressed toward the 20th century. The cornerstone of this two-disc set is \"April 1865: The Month That Changed America,\" which thoroughly examines the most tumultuous month in U.S. history, encompassing Gen. Robert E. Lee's ill-fated campaigns including carnage at Sailor's Creek and eventual retreat from Richmond, Virginia, and Confederate surrender to Gen. U.S. Grant at Appomattox on April 9, 1865. Add the brutal efficiency of Sherman's March, Booth's plot to assassinate Lincoln, and administrative mistakes that put Lee at a strategic disadvantage, and you begin to see (with input from authoritative scholars, authors, and historians) how Union victory was purely a matter of circumstance.While the factual details and expert interviews grow somewhat redundant (as does the repeated use of archival photos and documents), the sheer accumulation of historical detail makes this set a perfect complement to Ken Burns's epic documentaryThe Civil War, which clearly influenced these programs. \"The Tragedy at Cold Harbor\" examines the war's lesser-known catastrophic battle, while biographical portraits of Lincoln, Lee, and Confederate president Jefferson Davis reflect major events through the lives of the war's most influential leaders, north and south. Geared toward viewers with a basic awareness of Civil War history, these programs depict the inevitable chaos of an erratic war, unleashed in a country that needed to rip itself apart before it could reunite to forge a new and brighter future.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004FGA2HQ", "B0086IMN80", "B000B66H28", "B002MXN24Y", "0767026225", "B002MXN24O", "B001EXE2W4", "B005X7H9V8", "B004YDSN3U", "B0006Z2L6U", "B000T28PFQ", "B000NA2TTW", "B007PXYVLO", "B000ZDQI9O", "B00005MKOB", "B005ELVCOI", "B004MCGNVM", "B00009OOFA", "B0006Z2L9W", "B007TBKAXK", "B004FZMDTC", "B00HYZ0ZYK", "B00003CXA6", "B004H9ZQ4K", "0060899689", "B00005Q5K3", "B005ELVC3O", "B000NHG7DY", "B004Z2ECX0", "B000XNZ7KM", "B008XAT1JK", "B00005OSJP", "B00008PHCY", "B00A3THVGE", "B0089VX0UO", "B0049TC8CQ", "B00IJZW4HK", "B00CVB6UXW", "B002ID09BM", "B00A2XTHYU", "B008XAT0YQ", "0615837891", "B00JAD6GS8", "B000NO2402", "B00005AA9D", "B000BB1520", "B008XAT0ZU", "B002DHACT2", "B004AR4WSA", "B00B4TAXXK", "B003EYEEI8", "0792262069", "B000742G0G", "B000P6R5PW", "B00078XGP6", "B005QW98AK", "B0041H55H6", "B0086IMNHQ", "B00028G7IO", "B0053TWVGY", "0679601120", "B00BHK99JU", "B006QVRWD0", "B000AQ69QI", "B0007GP836", "0811712184", "B000CSTK7O", "0982770073", "B0012IV3PU", "B000GG4Y5A", "B0058KGHX6", "B002NN7ETC", "B00028G75C", "B002NB420S", "B00005PJ8K", "B004G9UXB2", "B0014CKCEC", "B00390F1IY", "B000VWZ0L6", "B005ELVC48", "B001DW2BKG", "B005ORVN00", "B0082GN8X0", "B000NO240W", "B0038EG20W", "0800177967", "B000E1MXZ0", "B008XJM7T2", "B00005OSJQ", "B002UJIY8O", "B003XQRZ56", "B003XMKU4I", "B006J6CED0", "B002RUNMMO", "B00005JXI7", "B00096S4BM", "B00005J75F", "B004HHX9XC", "B0023Y5434", "B000BITUHU"], "bought_together": ["B0086IMN80", "B004FGA2HQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0086IMN80", "B004FGA2HQ", "B00A2XTHYU", "B000B66H28"]}, "price": 9.95, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 128475}, "asin": "B0000A14WH", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41HNWJQTBYL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Last Days of the Civil War (History Channel)"}

{"description": "The miniseries treatment is suited toDoctor Zhivago, the sprawling Boris Pasternaknovelof a Russian physician-poet whose comfortable life is upended by the Revolution. And this near-four-hour British production lucidly demonstrates that Pasternak was one heck of a storyteller:  the torment of Zhivago (Hans Matheson) as he must choose between his well-bred childhood sweetheart (Alexandra Maria Lara, real comer) and the tragically beautiful Lara (Keira Knightley, fromPirates of the Caribbean) remains compelling. The TV treatment can't match the epic sweep ofDavid Lean's feature film, of course, with its cast of thousands and astonishing production design. Devotees of that 1965 version will undoubtedly yearn for Maurice Jarre's tinkly hit \"Lara's Theme,\" too; here, Ludovico Einaudi's score is serviceable by comparison. Matheson never gets untracked in the title role, but the uncannily gorgeous Knightley and a supremely decadent Sam Neill (as her dreadful seducer) keep their characters vital. The limitations of the small screen duly noted, the frosty location shooting is handsome. Given the choice, see the Lean film on the big screen every time; but this is sturdy introduction to a classic story.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B003LMPKSQ", "B008220C38", "B004VHOAGS", "B00006L949", "B001TOCCRU", "B000ERVJPE", "B0077PBPJ6", "B0002XVS6U", "B00104J4IO", "B0026IQTQI", "B001L57ZZG", "B000QGE86K", "B005335K8G", "B00D7AM2QK", "0679407596", "B002PRYL9C", "B001J4E1D8", "B00ARX2VZW", "B0013XZ6X4", "B00EKFI1HA", "B0026IQTOA", "B000089QEM", "B0009PVZM8", "B00H4BHIGW", "B004EQAVHI", "B000BPK2IY", "B000NTM9ZW", "B0009G3B0G", "B008220C56", "B00006JO77", "B00IKM5OTW", "B006ISJQ26", "B00HUAH14Q", "B000M2E32M", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B009L2EW5W", "B00BMQODEU", "B00008DDRZ", "B001PU8N0I", "B009NRQTGU", "B0083HXKMC", "B0080QOL10", "B00005JOA0", "B000E0ODZE", "B009B1EPQ4", "B000A2W1X2", "B005T0OY5S", "0767812115", "0767827775", "B001PUTN3Y", "B00H540M9S", "B00HUTPKA4", "B001P807RC", "B000I2J6WI", "B000Z27HMW", "B000ERVJQ8", "B006PTL1QM", "B000I8OOHE", "B004RIACU4", "B000062XDP", "B0031RAP5O", "B007L6VRBM", "B0077PBPVE", "B0077PBPGO", "B004D45NYC", "B000056KMW", "B00D49YEHO", "B0009OL92K", "B0090XUARQ", "B003CP1T50", "B005CFBZD4", "B004VK742M", "B002CWKTUA", "B001KEHAEE", "B000BNTMKK", "B0046ZYEUW", "6305428115", "B000A8AXXG", "B009ERK0SW", "B000NJL4QC", "B00H4ZEFTQ", "B004XVMCMQ", "B004QDRW0S", "B00E1LT41K", "B004IK30KA", "B0013NAML0", "B005JZBPAK", "B00BBXSP84", "B001B1Q2UO", "B00H4BHIF8", "B00F1BFRA6", "B000EMGF2Q", "B002AMUDJY", "B00J49R1BY", "B00BOTCJXC", "B00B18FA50", "B004SUDQDQ", "B000T28Q00", "B000FQIRXQ", "5489003219"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003LMPKSQ", "B002M2Z3BA", "B008220C38", "B0016K40KY"]}, "price": 7.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 165653}, "asin": "B0000C2IQG", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5173D2EBJBL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Doctor Zhivago (TV Miniseries)"}
{"description": "Exceptionally moving but not the least bit sentimental,Concert for Georgeis a splendid tribute to the late George Harrison, whose contributions to the Beatles were so often hidden in the long shadows of John Lennon and Paul McCartney. A year to the day after Harrison's November 29, 2001 death, Eric Clapton assembled some musicians--people who had played with Harrison and known him intimately, including McCartney, Ringo Starr, and Tom Petty--to perform his music at London's Royal Albert Hall. They take on not just the predictable (\"My Sweet Lord\" and \"Something,\" beautifully sung by Billy Preston and Sir Paul, respectively), but also lesser-known fare like \"Old Brown Shoe\" and \"Beware of Darkness,\" all to superbly empathetic effect. But the tune most likely to make you misty-eyed is \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps,\" which brings together three of the five musicians who played on the original recording: Ringo on drums, Clapton replicating his own classic solo, and McCartney playing piano and harmonizing with Clapton's lead vocal.Concert for Georgeenjoyed a brief theatrical release, but even those who caught it on the big screen will delight in this two-disc DVD edition. Disc 1 features the complete concert (sansinterview and rehearsal footage, but with a few additional songs and in the original running order), while disc 2 contains the theatrical version and some additional backstage and photo material. All in all, a beautiful piece of work.

{"description": "For earthbound humans,Winged Migrationis as close as any of us will get to sharing the sky with our fine feathered friends. It's as if French director Jacques Perrin and his international crew of dedicated filmmakers had been given a full-access pass by Mother Nature herself, with the complete \"cooperation\" of countless species of migrating birds, all answering to eons of migratory instinct. The film is utterly simple in purpose, with minimal narration and on-screen titles to identify the wondrous varieties of flying wildlife, but its visceral effect is humbling, awesome and magnificently profound. Technically, Perrin surpasses the achievement of his earlier filmMicrocosmos(which did for insects what this film does for birds), and apart from a few digital skyscapes for poetic effect, this astonishing film uses no special effects whatsoever, with soaring, seemingly miraculous camera work that blesses the viewer with, quite literally, a bird's-eye view.

{"description": "Touted as \"a movie about people who do stuff that is not normal,\"Frank  Zappa'sBaby Snakeschronicles a late-'70s Halloween stand in  New York City (a zany enough proceeding in its own right) with  digressions throughout the first half for backstage antics, band  interviews, and some outlandish clay animation from Bruce Bickford, with  whose work Zappa was obviously smitten. Onstage, Zappa is a live wire,  the audience is appropriately rambunctious, and the band--an especially  potent incarnation of the famous Mothers of Invention--is tight as could  be. The film amounts to a three-hour musical carnival whose participants  lack any trace of artistic or personal inhibition. Zappa, who died in  1993, always worked with consummate musicians, andBaby Snakesshowcases the cream of the crop:Terry  Bozzio(one of the greatest drummers ever to command a kit), bassistPatrick  O'Hearn, keyboard wizard Tommy Mars, and even pop chameleonAdrian  Belew.The DVD packaging, with its deluxe miniature dossier on Zappa and the  film, is fabulous, and the sound and picture seem about as good as they  could be, under the influence--that is, the circumstances.

Emmett (Peter Paige) finally came face-to-face with his affection for friend Ted (Scott Lowell), only to have Ted's growing drug habit get in the way of their happiness. Lesbians Melanie (Michelle Clunie) and Lindsay (Thea Gill) decided to have another baby, whose father would be... Michael (Hal Sparks), whose nesting with hunky Ben (Robert Gant) is rudely interrupted by runaway Hunter (Harris Allan). And as for Brian (Gale Harold), the man everybody wants but can't ever have?

{"description": "Partly inspired by 1948'sThe Big Clockand its nominal 1987 remakeNo Way Out, the Denzel Washington thrillerOut of Timeis quite enjoyable if you ignore its implausible plotting. Like those earlier films, this reunion of Washington and hisDevil in a Blue Dressdirector Carl Franklin is about a man--in this case the police chief (Washington) of sleepy Banyan Key, Florida--who falls into a trap set by others, sinks into legal quicksand of his own making, and must race the clock to extricate himself from a series of incriminating setbacks. The Florida setting adds welcome character to the potboiler plot, and Washington's screen-cred makes it easy to overlook the absurdities of rookie writer David Collard's screenplay. Eva Mendes is sharp and sensible as Washington's estranged wife (do you think they'll reconcile for a happy ending?), and the talented John Billingsley--whose portrayal of \"Dr. Phlox\" on TV'sEnterpriseis vastly underrated--is a constant delight as Washington's medical examiner, beer buddy and wily co-conspirator. It's hardly a classic, butOut of Timegoes well with a big tub of popcorn.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JPD0", "B000GFLKF8", "B00005JN0W", "B000244GCC", "B002LMV7R0", "6304884400", "B002VWNIEA", "B00005JKWX", "B000OT6V0K", "B005LAIGRS", "0783240295", "B0050MB4OO", "6304765258", "B00BTYOYG2", "B002ZG99TA", "B00005JA9F", "B0006210ZG", "B0000542CJ", "078324228X", "0767818075", "B002CPMB9O", "B002ZG997C", "B00AFEXRME", "B00441GZ1Y", "B002GHHHN8", "B00096S49Y", "B000N60HAO", "B00BEIYN9Q", "B005LAIGLE", "B002AT8K9W", "B00005JLRZ", "B00125WAWS", "B003BV8I3Q", "B0001VTPUO", "B008E70EES", "B0013J55B6", "B0007KZQAM", "B001JV5AZE", "B002O3Z4WK", "0800141806", "B000F8DV1M", "B002NZK5UU", "B00AEFXT1S", "B002AT8KAG", "B00BB67UNW", "B00J5G1P2W", "B002DU39GW", "B000G5SILC", "B00441GYXI", "0767810872", "B000ZS8GWQ", "B008FCX2D2", "B00AEBB86A", "B00008EYA5", "B00DZP1C2W", "B001UV4XRY", "0790730979", "6305428115", "0790736411", "6305161933", "B0006GAI5U", "B00BEIYHO2", "B008B9JTLI", "0783229402", "B001KRVLCI", "B003L20IG0", "B008JFUNKU", "B00AEBB8LA", "B00JA3RVG4", "B000VG66XS", "B0006GANOQ", "B00009L1TA", "B000R4SMCW", "B005OK721G", "B000EGDB10", "B00HEPC0TS", "B001L57ZYM", "B000069HZP", "B000P0J0EM", "B00007AJG1", "B00015YVDG", "6305505802", "B00005JMWP", "B004EPYZP8", "B00AEFXX9Q", "B000RO9Q7W", "B000244GCW", "B007EQR0D8", "B00J2MPZQG", "B00005JN0T", "B000QXDCLU", "B000P0I4O4", "B00005JNQA", "B005FUTBWS", "B00005JKQS", "0790742004", "B005YFGJFG", "B0002J4X2K", "B000N3SRO0", "B00013RC66"], "bought_together": ["B00005JPD0", "B00005JN0W"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005JN0W", "B00005JKWX", "B00005JPD0", "B000GFLKF8"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 29468}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.98, "brand": "Mgm/Ua Studios", "asin": "B0000VJG72", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51bhUc7kE0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Out of Time"}

When a white rabbit flashes on screen, you can \"branch\" the most interesting documentary footage: how \"bullet time\" is being recalibrated and how you go about replicating so many Agent Smiths. A timeline is wonderfully put together, but cumbersome to navigate through. The extras certainly illustrate how the movie did not deserve to be passed over for a few technical Oscar nominations.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000AXE8I", "B000P0J0AQ", "B00008LDPU", "B001TK80C0", "B00005N5S5", "B001VLBDD0", "B000AYELVA", "B004LWZW42", "B004LWZWGA", "B001FB55HQ", "B001HN697M", "B000EGDB10", "B0002J4X1Q", "B001GCUO1Q", "B00005JN0T", "B00005JNJV", "B003Y5H5EW", "B001GKJ2E8", "B005LAIHXQ", "B000UR9T8C", "B000VWYJ86", "B009MO57H6", "B00005JMEW", "B00005JMUA", "B00003CWT6", "B001DHXT20", "B00005JKZV", "B00005JKCH", "B000HCO83Q", "B000U7WV1Y", "B000099635", "B0000VAFO0", "B000HRMAPE", "B001DJLD1M", "B008JFUS0U", "B000VR0570", "B005LAIGW8", "B001GZ6QC4", "B005G4TJUC", "B000QXDED6", "B000P0J06K", "B0087ZG7NO", "B00005JLXH", "B004LWZWFQ", "B00003CXTA", "B00IKM5LXG", "B00005JKWJ", "B002ZG98UA", "B0002KVUKM", "B00004STUL", "0780624890", "B00011CZRE", "B004SIP95G", "B00005JKZY", "B00005JA8B", "B00E5I2M6I", "B0090SI56Y", "B0009MDPYM", "B008JFUPFI", "B00005JNTU", "B002IPFWTE", "B000P0J06U", "B001F7MSFM", "B000AYELVU", "B007K3JFUQ", "B00005JMQW", "B0049IHX2C", "B0007P0XBO", "B008Y1YK9Y", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B0085A9HU6", "B00AEFY5B6", "B008JFUO72", "B00006HBUJ", "B001AK3S4Y", "B000P0J0EW", "B0007V6ITE", "0767834739", "B00005JLWN", "B0000VCZK2", "B00FEHCQEC", "B0014Z4ON4", "B001UV4XHY", "B002GSXKNI", "B00BEZTMFY", "B00070FX5U", "B00177YA1K", "B00005JKIP", "B003QO8TOQ", "B000U1ZV8K", "B002ZG980U", "B0007DFJ0G", "B0045HCJGC", "B00000JQB5", "B00005JL78", "B004EPYZUS", "B002ZG99QS", "B000AP04FG", "B000HEVZ9E", "B000OVLBF8"], "bought_together": ["B0000AXE8I", "B000P0J0AQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001DJLD1M", "B000P0J0AQ", "B0000AXE8I", "B001BRJZPW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 123737}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.95, "brand": "Matrix", "asin": "B0001BKAEE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5149DT5Y2CL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Matrix Revolutions (Two-Disc Full Screen Edition) [DVD]"}

{"description": "Pay cable's \"other\"show about life and death,Dead Like Metakes a darkly comic look at mortality through the eyes of someone stuck between this life and the afterlife. \"Bail bondsmen for the disembodied\" is how Rube (Mandy Patinkin), the often exasperated Reaper foreman, explains it to disaffected 18-year-old George (Ellen Muth) after she&rsquo;s vaporized by a falling toilet seat from theMirspace station and drafted into the ranks of the Reapers. It's now her job to take the souls of the doomed, preferably before their mortal coil is damaged beyond recognition by the devilish machinations of the gremlin-like gravelings.You wouldn&rsquo;t mistake George's fellow Reapers for the do-gooders ofTouched by an Angel, but they are anything but grim. Charming British shyster Mason (Callum Blue) always has some scam brewing, high-living, fun-loving former flapper Betty (Rebecca Gayheart) treats death as a cabaret (\"Reaping Havoc\"), and one-time starlet and wannabe actress Daisy (Laura Harris) still nurses her dreams of stardom. Even hard-bitten meter maid Roxy (Jasmine Guy) manages to find a way to let loose.Dead Like Meputs a light touch on black comedy, but it has a sneaky way of using humor to explore loss, loneliness, and regret, as well as kindness, and courage, and responsibility. George gets a hard lesson when she tries to wriggle out of her assignments like some overgrown kid, only to see the damage of her (in)action in \"Reapercussions.\" And as George's angry, tightly-wound mother (Cynthia Stevenson) and withdrawn little sister Reggie cope with death, she breaks the rules to watch over them: their own pouty, glum guardian angel. There's nothing like your own death to put your life into perspective.The four-disc set features all 14 episodes of the debut season of Showtime's witty black comedy. The feature-length pilot includes optional commentary by cast members Ellen Muth, Mandy Patinkin, Jasmine Guy, Cynthia Stevenson, and Callum Blue. Other supplements include the nominal documentary featurettesDead Like Me: Behind-the-scenesandThe Music of Dead Like Me(with theme song composer Stewart Copeland), 32 deleted scenes, and a still gallery.--Sean AxmakerStills fromDead Like Me - The Complete First Season(Click for larger image)&nbsp;&nbsp;", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00094ARGY", "B001JV5BHQ", "B0006GAO18", "B00GT4NCK6", "B000YAA2SQ", "B001FB4VZ8", "B001EN5I3Q", "B001WAKNCC", "B005SEDI5M", "B0007TKHKC", "B001A7X0ZO", "B001XW7ICW", "B000EHSVKK", "B00GT2TEPU", "B001FB4VZI", "B000O77SMW", "B008PJZDXW", "B00DNUSFZQ", "B000GG4Y28", "B000QDLSR0", "B000E6EK42", "B0002JP4DW", "B000AO9BSS", "B0018CWEYY", "B000I0QLR8", "B005PPMHO2", "B000U1ZV1W", "B000I0QLQY", "B0019LY5IM", "B0018CWEXA", "B00005JNOG", "B000I0QLRI", "B000GH3CWK", "B004BZ5AHI", "B008H1Q61G", "B004SMDJ9U", "B0001KL5DA", "B0007R4SWM", "B000I0QLRS", "B003L77GWE", "B001ASIHZG", "B0019Z3P84", "B003R0MEYA", "B0009NZ2W4", "B0051GOB2G", "B0002XVKMM", "B00022FWEU", "B000O77SN6", "B001C8W7EQ", "B000FIMG68", "B002AK9UPO", "B00540G3GG", "B004X60QE2", "B000MEYKCS", "B000SMNL92", "B00HUCF7AO", "B001DPHDBU", "B00133QNS6", "B0025KVKDO", "B000NOKFH6", "B0081QF6Q8", "B002GP7ZV4", "B003FSTN7K", "B000T9OP7G", "B000HWZ4MA", "B0002PYS7Y", "B007AFC0W4", "B000FL7CAK", "B00062IDEW", "B001AZIRZ4", "B000ERVJKE", "B000ENUYGI", "B0009IW88K", "B0000AQS0F", "B002N5N5MK", "B000GTLQVW", "B001B7CNZ6", "B0000AUHQE", "B00GOC74QG", "B008B4KVRE", "B009AMAGQM", "B008YRL6LI", "B002BWP2IK", "B004XM38CS", "B000SO7PBU", "B000EOTV98", "B00005JPII", "B0085KGG96", "B000GG4Y5K", "B004QOB8TS", "B000Q6GUW0", "0792159659", "B001DF681G", "B002CAWNEM", "B0037AGB9O", "B002D1XKB0", "B008QE9XD2", "B00A8KJN8M"], "bought_together": ["B001JV5BHQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00GT2TEPU", "B000YAA2SQ", "B0006GAO18", "B001FB4VZ8"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 35276}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 49.98, "brand": "MUTH,ELLEN", "asin": "B0001GF2F6", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ZLwUB8oPL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Dead Like Me - The Complete First Season"}
{"description": "The world of high school gets a treatment both glamorous and terrifying in  the TV seriesPopular. The show spins around two characters: Blonde  cheerleader Brooke (Leslie Bibb) and brunette alterna-girl Sam (Carly  Pope), each the center of their social groups. To their mutual horror,  Brooke's divorced father and Sam's widowed mother fall in love, turning  these cultural opposites into stepsisters. The large supporting cast  includes overweight but determined Carmen (Sara Rue), conniving  Lady-Macbeth-with-pom-poms Nicole (Tammy Lynn Michaels), earnest jock Josh  (Bryce Johnson), all-encompassing activist Lily (Tamara Mello), frustrated  sensitive boy Harrison (Christopher Gorham), and many others. The key toPopularis how it merges melodramatic soap-opera stories with  wrenchingly blunt and honest portrayals of the cruelties of adolescence.While some viewers may find it galling to listen to a gorgeous young  actress who's been on magazine covers moan about how she can't be as  perfect as a model, the series tackles everything from anorexia to peer  manipulation to teen sex with directness and an eye for moral and  emotional complexity. An episode about a Sadie Hawkins dance becomes a  satirical farce about body image (femaleandmale); a slumber party  turns into brutal humiliation; a teacher decides to get a sex-change  operation, prompting anxiety throughout the school. Almost every character  gets a moment of heartfelt grandstanding, yet the actors pull them off  with commitment and guts (Rue routinely turns speeches that could have  been cheesy schlock into genuine pathos). Sure, some fantasy sequences are  silly, but the show skillfully creates characters and situations that defy  easy definition. Repeatedly, Brooke and Sam each set out with good  intentions, only to end up hurting their friends and fueling their  antagonistic relationship.Popularcunningly subverts expectations;  it's a smart show for both teenagers and adults.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0006J28DW", "B000E33VYU", "B0009F43DG", "B0006J28E6", "B000FUTVPA", "B00092ZM7U", "B00KNAMMOY", "B00133QNSG", "B0001IN0T4", "B00133QNRW", "B003TJM5RK", "B000BNXD6O", "B0077PTWY6", "B0077PTWHI", "B00133QNS6", "B00BGQ2NIO", "B00127RAGM", "B0007TKHKC", "B000P6YNT8", "B003R0MF6W", "B004YM6JQO", "B00FPUN61U", "B00BGQ2NDO", "B00005JPII", "B001NPK5C4", "B001ULCY48", "B007MDB6RO", "B0033WH6MW", "B001UHOWYM", "B00DW5IL92", "B000LXH3SI", "B00GB0ORJ8", "B00FPUN57K", "B001L1S1SK", "B004GJYRFA", "B00CMVVCRU", "B0001EQHXO", "B001MVYUSO", "B000U1ZV2G", "B00CKJJ1G8", "B00BMKGZVA", "B0002I838Q", "B007W2MKFM", "B0018CWEXA", "B0030VANIU", "B000NA78SE", "B00DDHFKMA", "B000VZADPQ", "B007ZR9HP0", "B0053TWVQ4", "B008L0YMWS", "B00DRSGQ7I", "B0006GAO18", "B008I34YOO", "B00BBGZ17O", "B00005JNAF", "B00C5SE8F8", "B003L77GEM", "B003ES5JH4", "B000NA2BEU", "630529335X", "B00ECXJC28", "B002TQKL4S", "B00191AEYQ", "B002ZTQW3S", "B003F3NDOE", "B00GTZWZH6", "B000MGBLEQ", "B000FUTVV4", "B005UQQRBA", "B0024FAD7O", "B0000AKCJK", "B001JAHPZ8", "B000FL7CAK", "B00F1FVKVC", "B001FB5TAY", "B008JBJAM6", "B001GP5TMW", "B002AK9UOK", "B00E4Q6U9Q", "6305428425", "B00AJCOZVY", "B0056GLNQI", "B00BT1XCOU", "B0011UBDS6", "B00AEFXO8Q", "B00919TITU", "B00ED2IBXE", "B00FZ4KT84", "B003R4ZMJU", "B00002SSKI", "B007PKSO2Y", "B00369ERC4", "B0019N8P2W", "B001UREJXQ", "B000F6ZIIS", "B004HW7JI8", "B001ILFUAA", "B00BIR381W"], "bought_together": ["B0006J28DW", "B000E33VYU"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000E33VYU", "B0006J28E6", "B0009F43DG", "B0006J28DW"]}, "price": 19.86, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 81292}, "asin": "B0001I55S8", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/511V53JGTSL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Popular: Season 1"}

{"description": "For many fans, the Superman revisionist seriesSmallvilletruly hit its stride in its second season, when it shifted focus from traditional comic book conflicts to one of self-discovery for its hero, a teenage Clark Kent (Tom Welling).  Fans and first-timers can judge for themselves with this six-disc set, which compiles all 23 episodes and a decent selection of supplemental features. Whereas season 1 focused on Clark using his powers to combat a host of menaces &#xE0; la the WB's other big fantasy hit,Buffy the Vampire Slayer, season 2 delved into Clark's past and the extent of his super powers, most notably in the back-to-back \"Heat,\" in which he discovers his heat vision, and \"Red,\" in which red kryptonite in the high school class rings uncorks Clark's less-than-upstanding side. Other plot developments from the season that pull the series in interesting directions include the arrival of Dr. Helen Bryce (Emanuelle Vaugier), who becomes involved with Lex Luthor (Michael Rosenbaum), but the season's most significant moment comes during episode 17, \"Rosetta,\" in which Clark learns of his Kryptonian origins courtesy of a scientist, who, in an effective bit of casting, is played bySupermanfilm star Christopher Reeve.The complexity of the writing and issues dealt with in season 2 markedSmallvilleas a series with depth and drama worthy of its considerable fan following as well as a second boxed set; fittingly, the supplements in this set are more expansive than on the first one.  Producers Alfred Gough, Miles Millar, and Greg Beeman and cast members Welling, Rosenbaum, and Kristen Kreuk weigh in on commentary tracks for two episodes (\"Red\" and \"Rosetta\"), while a trio of short featurettes explore Christopher Reeves's appearance in \"Rosetta,\" the show's visual effects, and the amusing \"Wall of Weird\" web page maintained by Chloe (Allison Mack). The extras are rounded out by a handful of deleted scenes and a gag reel.--Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0002Y0QV2", "B00005JLKB", "B0009A5MUO", "B000G1R4SO", "B000N6SE4U", "B000X5SMXY", "B001FB4VZS", "B002JVWRDQ", "B003L77GG0", "B000R206FK", "B002JVWRE0", "B001FB4W02", "B0012U7IWU", "B003L77GGA", "B00G4SCKAK", "B00080ZG2O", "B00BBXSPES", "B000BT96EG", "B00BBXSPCK", "B00BGI086Q", "B004XWLN20", "B00DTRR43W", "B000EHSVLE", "B00ED2IBXE", "B000EHSVLY", "B000FP2OPY", "B000F8O2OM", "B00260HH30", "B00133QNRW", "B009LDCXNY", "B00JF5G8WU", "B000R7GKQE", "B001MVWRNE", "B00CN009Y2", "B000EU1Q2M", "1401241824", "B00DYEN6XC", "B004YM6JI2", "B0001CNRS4", "B000B8384G", "B000I0QLR8", "B004YM6JLO", "1401243096", "B006LG74Q0", "B002JVWRB8", "B001DJLD2G", "B000BT96FA", "B000EHSVKK", "B004YPED14", "B0000AKY3Q", "B000NOKFGW", "B0015RRNMA", "B002JVWRD6", "B0058YPGL6", "B002JVWRAO", "B00915G4IC", "B007MDB6Y2", "B0001EFTH4", "B000X5SPBI", "B00005Y71G", "B001EWDXT8", "B000EHSVL4", "B005SH63HO", "B000HT3P60", "B00F4FFO8E", "B004LROMWU", "B000I0QLS2", "B002JVWR4A", "B000CCBC9O", "B0018RKEQY", "B0018CWEYY", "1401246370", "B00280LZAE", "B00915G6SU", "B0002CX1M0", "B0012BS5XU", "B001FB4W0C", "B004HW7JNS", "B00IYRLUAU", "B0019LY5IM", "B0053O89IS", "B000IJ79UW", "B000RO6JYK", "B000SMNL92", "B00EIL7E9C", "B001FB4VXU", "B00E5I2MDQ", "B00IGVJGZK", "B00HQOFAKI", "B00AEBBA36", "B004FQX5B6", "B0052C5EI4", "B0000DIXDR", "B00GZ0ML4C", "B008JFUS0U", "B008X6N8KW", "B00DXLO0D6", "B00CL151G4", "B000EHSVG4", "B005IA9JQ8"], "bought_together": ["B0002Y0QV2", "B00005JLKB"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005JLKB", "B004XWLN20", "B0002Y0QV2", "B000N6SE4U"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 6376}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 23.99, "brand": "WEA", "asin": "B0001JXPPC", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51YFOkMz2tL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Smallville: Season 2"}

{"description": "The cutting wit of Tina Fey (the first female head writer forSaturday Night Live) brilliantly fuses pop culture and smart satire. Fey wroteMean Girls, in which a formerly home-schooled girl named Cady (Lindsay Lohan) gets dropped into the sneaky, vicious world of the Plastics, three adolescent glamour-girls who dominate their public high school's social hierarchy. Cady first befriends a couple of art-punk outsiders who persuade her to infiltrate the Plastics and destroy them from within--but power corrupts, and Cady soon finds the glory of being a Plastic to be seductive.Mean Girlsjoins the ranks ofClueless,Bring It On, andHeathers, cunning movies that use the hormone-pressurized high school milieu to put the dark impulses of human nature--ambition, envy, lust, revenge--under a comic microscope. Fey manages to skewer everyone without forgetting the characters' hapless humanity; it's a dazzling and delightful balancing act.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEFXO8Q", "B0036TGSIK", "B00AEBB8R4", "B00AEFYMBO", "B008JFUUIA", "B00005JMCW", "B000J4QW7W", "B00003CXMP", "B00005O5CM", "B00466HN7M", "B00441GYVK", "B00005JN0Z", "B0018CNNV2", "B00447L4KA", "B00AG473GE", "B001AEF6BS", "B003Y5H574", "B00AEFXXMI", "B00008K7AM", "B000CEV3KU", "B00006ZXSL", "B001AEF6BI", "B001OQCUYI", "B0000DIXDR", "B0053TWVQ4", "B00AEFY99O", "B003NHRIVQ", "B00AEBBA2M", "B000GB775E", "B001BL96K2", "B00E8RKHWW", "B004SIP9X8", "B00AEFXUXU", "B001H1I8KK", "B0007LXPBI", "B0007LXPBS", "B006X08DZ0", "B00001PE4D", "B000324Y98", "B006TTC50Y", "B000YAA68C", "B00002SSKI", "B000P0J0A6", "B002GIBVQ6", "6305428425", "B00000F0AD", "B00164KYV4", "B00007E2F5", "B000FCW15A", "B0035Q637K", "B000683VI4", "B003Y5H52O", "B00005JM55", "B00062IVN0", "B00005MEVO", "B00AEFY5TI", "B004EPYZU8", "B0002VYOVI", "B001MM3AZM", "B004EPZ0BG", "B00AMEZDJW", "B005Z9MFRC", "B000J103OI", "B000FS9MXI", "B0041KKYGU", "B0007PALZ2", "B004P7CN7W", "B000P0J09W", "6302077818", "B00005JNBQ", "B003TY2SWC", "B00AEBB9F0", "B002ZG989G", "B001UV4XUG", "0783235070", "B002ZG9968", "B000A2X3U2", "B004EPZ084", "B002DOBGWM", "B00AEFXZJE", "B0001I563M", "B0009OL7Z4", "B00028HBES", "B00404ME2Y", "B002ZG976U", "B003B3V0N4", "B0007PLLBU", "B000AM4P9A", "B005LAII12", "B002K0WBXW", "B00AEFXE9U", "B000Z8GZYW", "B00AEFYQE2", "B003B1X85O", "B00081U7HC", "B00AEFY0F2", "B003Y5H5B0", "B000YDBPAM", "B00004Y2R1", "B0006TPE4C"], "bought_together": ["B00AEFXO8Q"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B008JFUUIA", "B0036TGSIK", "B00AEBB8R4", "B00466HN7M"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 81958}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.97, "brand": "Paramount", "asin": "B0002IQJ8W", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510H7MK4TXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Mean Girls (Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "AddKeen Eddieto the long list of unique TV shows that never  clicked with a mainstream following--but which found a small but devoted  fan base, for whom this DVD set is a gift from above. New York cop Eddie  Arlette (pugnaciously good-looking Mark Valley) fumbles a major drug bust  and gets sent to London to mop up the mess he's made. But Eddie's New York  attitude proves a successful addition to Scotland Yard, so ambitious  Superintendent Johnson (Colin Salmon,Prime Suspect 2) decides to  keep Eddie on the team--which suits his new partner, neurotic swinger  Monty Pippin (Julian Rhind-Tutt, BBC miniseriesReckless) but  infuriates Eddie's accidental flatmate, the luscious, tempestuous, and  frequently scantily clad Fiona (Sienna Miller).Individual shows follow  self-contained investigations (like a stolen race-horse, a casino robbed  by guys in Duran Duran masks, a school hazing gone too far, or a  kidnapping by a French mob boss with an astrology obsession), while the  rising sparks between Eddie and Fiona can be charted across the 13 episodes (which are presented in order of airdate, not the sequence in  which they were created; the ideal sequence can be learned from various  fan Web sites).Keen Eddie's quirky, syncopated rhythm can sometimes  feel a little forced and the visual flash and rapid-fire editing owe a lot  to the movies of Guy Ritchie (Snatch), but the result was  nonetheless a distinctive show that deserved more of an audience than it  got.

{"description": "The filmed version ofHarry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, adapted from the wildly popular book by J.K. Rowling, stunningly brings to life Harry Potter's world of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The greatest strength of the film comes from its faithfulness to the novel, and this new cinematic world is filled with all the details of Rowling's imagination, thanks to exuberant sets, elaborate costumes, clever makeup and visual effects, and a cr&#xE8;me de la cr&#xE8;me cast, including Maggie Smith, Richard Harris, Alan Rickman, and more. Especially fine is the interplay between Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) and his schoolmates Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson), as well as his protector, the looming Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane). The second-half adventure--involving the titular sorcerer's stone--doesn't translate perfectly from page to screen, ultimately because of the film's fidelity to the novel; this is a case of making a movie for the book's fans, as opposed to a transcending film. Writer Steve Kloves and director Chris Columbus keep the spooks in check, making this a true family film, and with its resourceful hero wide-eyed and ready, one can't wait for Harry's return.First sequels are the true test of an enduring movie franchise, andHarry Potter and the Chamber of Secretspasses with flying colors. Harry's second year at Hogwarts involves a darker, more malevolent tale (parents with younger children beware), beginning with the petrified bodies of several Hogwarts students and magical clues leading Harry, Ron, and Hermione to a 50-year-old mystery in the monster-laden Chamber of Secrets. House elves, squealing mandrakes, giant spiders, and venomous serpents populate this loyal adaptation (by director Chris Columbus and screenwriter Steve Kloves), and Kenneth Branagh delightfully tops the supreme supporting cast as the vainglorious charlatan Gilderoy Lockhart. At 161 minutes, the film suffers from lack of depth and uneven pacing, and John Williams's score mostly reprises established themes. The young, fast-growing cast offers ample compensation, however, as does the late Richard Harris in his final screen appearance as Professor Albus Dumbledore. Brimming with cleverness, wonderment, and big-budget splendor, Chamber honors the legacy of J.K. Rowling's novels.Some movie-loving wizards must have cast a magic spell onHarry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, because it's another grand slam for the Harry Potter franchise. Demonstrating remarkable versatility after the arthouse success ofY Tu Mam&#xE1; Tambi&#xE9;n, director Alfonso Cuar&#xF3;n proves a perfect choice to guide Harry, Hermione, and Ron into treacherous puberty as the now 13-year-old students at Hogwarts face a new and daunting challenge: Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) has escaped from Azkaban prison, and for reasons yet unknown (unless, of course, you've read J.K. Rowling's book, considered by many to be the best in the series), he's after Harry in a bid for revenge. This dark and dangerous mystery drives the action while Harry and his third-year classmates discover the flying hippogriff Buckbeak (a marvelous CGI creature), the benevolent but enigmatic Professor Lupin (David Thewlis), horrifying black-robed Dementors, sneaky Peter Pettigrew (Timothy Spall), and the wonderful advantage of having a Time-Turner just when you need one. The familiar Hogwarts staff returns in fine form (including the delightful Michael Gambon, replacing the late Richard Harris as Dumbledore, and Emma Thompson as the goggle-eyed Sybil Trelawney), and even Julie Christie joins this prestigious production for a brief but welcome cameo. Technically dazzling, fast-paced, and chock-full of Rowling's boundless imagination,The Prisoner of Azkabanis a Potter-movie classic.

{"description": "Truth, identity, and responsibility are the cornerstones ofSmallville's exceptional third season. When viewers left Clark (Tom Welling) at the end ofseason 2, he was feeling his oats in Metropolis with the help of a red Kryptonite ring, but by the opening of season 3, he must return to Smallville to not only help his parents save their farm, but seek some resolution in his relationships with Lana (Kristin Kreuk) and Lex (Michael Rosenbaum), who's returned from his abandonment at the conclusion of the previous season. Lex himself must deal with some shocking revelations regarding his relationship with his sinister father Lionel (John Glover, magnetic as always), and Lana becomes involved with a new figure in town, the mysterious Adam Knight (Lost's Ian Somerholder), who may or may not be a certain caped crusader. And speaking of heroes in disguise, the season's finale introduces Kara, a young woman with powers similar to Clark's--could she in fact be his sister, known best to comic book fans as Supergirl? Season 3 is chock full of such intriguing moments, including an appearance by futureDaily Planeteditor Perry White (Michael McKean, the real-life husband of series star Annette O'Toole) in \"Perry,\" helmed bySupergirlfilm director Jeannot Szwarc; the return of villains Jonathan Taylor Thomas, Shawn Ashmore, and Jesse Metcalfe from seasons 1 and 2 (in \"Asylum\"); the departure of series regular Samuel L. Jones; and a intrigue-fraught final turn by Christopher Reeve as Dr. Swann (\"Legacy\").The boxed set matches the high quality of the season with some terrific extras, including commentary on three episodes by series creators Alfred Gough and Miles Millar, along with Rosenbaum, Allison Mack (Chloe), and Glover. Gough and Millar also contribute commentary to a battery of deleted scenes, and Mack's \"Chloe Chronicles\" returns for another go-round. The supplemental features are rounded out by a behind-the-scenes featurette, an amusing gag reel, and an Easter egg with Rosenbaum conducting some offbeat interviews.--Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0009A5MUO", "B0001JXPPC", "B000G1R4SO", "B000N6SE4U", "B000X5SMXY", "B00005JLKB", "B001FB4VZS", "B002JVWRDQ", "B003L77GG0", "B006CR2ON6", "B000R206FK", "B001FB4W02", "B0012U7IWU", "B002JVWRE0", "B003L77GGA", "B00G4SCOJW", "B00080ZG2O", "B00G4SCKAK", "B00BBXSPCK", "B00BBXSPES", "B00BGI086Q", "B00260HH30", "B000BT96EG", "B000P6XQ50", "B004EXNHO0", "B00DTRR43W", "B001DJLD2G", "B002N5N5MK", "B00DX88IL4", "B004PHSTTS", "B000FP2OPY", "B00G7QPX6C", "B0018CWEYY", "B000J10EQU", "1419826670", "B000PE0G0A", "B00JF5G8WU", "B0000640T0", "B00CN009Y2", "B001FB4W0C", "B002DQL34G", "B00F4FFO8E", "B00280LZAE", "B000EHSVM8", "B00915G6OE", "B0049IHWYG", "B001MVWRNE", "B0041QSZ7O", "B005SH63HO", "B000SMNL92", "B008JFUPFI", "B000X5SPBI", "B002FGUHBE", "B009LDCXNY", "B005PYKVRI", "B004SEUIWY", "B00ED2IBXE", "B00066FBQQ", "B00K7IPFSM", "B0051SFSAS", "B00915G6SU", "B000BT96FA", "B000HLDF9U", "B000F8O2P6", "B000A5046K", "B000O77SMW", "B0019LY5IM", "B000F8O2OW", "B00915G6TE", "B00EIL7E9C", "B003L77GGK", "B000R7GKQE", "B00B5J6A7W", "B00K7IPGS6", "B004LROMWU", "B00DYEN6XC", "B00023E88U", "B003ITZBVS", "B000B8384G", "B000CCBC9O", "B000I0QLS2", "B009LDD626", "B0025KVKDE", "B001C8W7EQ", "B00GTZWUPS", "B0002CX1M0", "B001MVWRN4", "1401210600", "B004HW7JNS", "1401234860", "B00IYRLUAU", "B00JPS6A3O", "B0072OFM28", "B004EPZ084", "B002JVWRAO", "B00915G6NK", "B00BEJL6JK", "B00JPS7HOA", "B005QET8FS", "B00CPEK3NI"], "bought_together": ["B0009A5MUO", "B0001JXPPC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0001JXPPC", "B0009A5MUO", "B000N6SE4U", "B000G1R4SO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 10632}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 29.69, "brand": "WEA", "asin": "B0002Y0QV2", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51FG3cFcvQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Smallville: Season 3"}
{"description": "Viewers eagerly awaited director Shinichiro Watanabe's first broadcast series sinceCowboy Bebop, and this quirky, violent period adventure was worth the wait. In contrast to the jazz-inflected disillusionment ofBebop,Champloooffers an edgy mix of martial arts combat and hip-hop irreverence. A string of coincidences brings together three misfits in Meiji-era Japan: Mugen, a rebellious vagabond; Jin, a taciturn ronin; and Fuu, a nutty waitress. Mugen, whose sardonic posture recalls Spike Spiegel, is a formidable swordsman, but he lacks the polish of a great martial artist. His movements, which incorporate break dance spins and flips, reflect his undisciplined nature. Jin is cool to the point of iciness: When he unsheathes his sword, he becomes a deadly work of art in motion. After helping them escape execution, Fuu demands Jin and Mugen stop fighting until they've helped her find an unnamed samurai \"who smells of sun flowers.\" Predictably, chaos ensues.

{"description": "People who cherish the post-Terms of Endearment, post-reincarnation phase of Shirley MacLaine's career might be surprised to discover just how sexy and kooky she was in a past life--that is, the first few years of her movie career. After the triumphs ofSome Came RunningandThe Apartment, MacLaine had a run of starring roles, including this elaborate comedy vehicle.What a Way to Go!cast MacLaine as an unlucky bride whose husbands meet early deaths, leaving her wealthy but unhappy. Gimmick casting of the hubbies adds a bit of dash:  Dick Van Dyke as a simple country storekeeper, Gene Kelly as a two-bit entertainer, bearded Paul Newman as a Brandoesque, bohemian painter in Paris. In the movie's best turn, Robert Mitchum gets to play a Howard Hughes character, and Dean Martin and Robert Cummings are around for the ride.A flabbergasting parade of Edith Head outfits keeps MacLaine hopping, and each segment has a Hollywood fantasy based on MacLaine's vision of her passing marriages (silent comedy, sexed-up foreign flick, splashy musical). Typical of a certain kind of super-production of the era, the film is impressive rather than entertaining, busy rather than funny. Perhaps hiring J. Lee Thompson, who directedThe Guns of Navarone, was not the best idea for this Comden-Green script. It snuck in as one of the top ten box-office grossers of 1964, and it has one great surrealist sequence where Gene Kelly orders his house and grounds to be painted entirely pink.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001BRZ5E2", "B002CAWNFQ", "B0006FO8PC", "B001HSNTGQ", "B00007J5VN", "B008FYZIEQ", "B000ND91YU", "B00005LOLC", "B0010AN7Z4", "B00K2CHW48", "B002A4IY34", "B000J40AK2", "B00BY8DEHS", "B000059XTI", "B0006VXMM6", "B00K6KII6C", "B0045HCJ80", "B000J10KNW", "B008FYZJ2C", "B000ECX0S8", "B000W089XS", "B000092Q4F", "B00DZP1BVO", "B00023P4RO", "B00AEFYRJQ", "B00AEBB9FA", "B003NF97IU", "B0024396DI", "B0007QS2ZC", "B00KS9V6EC", "B000063K2R", "B000EBD9U8", "B00008CMT4", "B00AEFY8ZE", "B00C3ALLSA", "B00C3ALLFS", "B00279MJHE", "B0008ENICU", "B000FG65RQ", "B0007QS30G", "B00009IB1F", "B00DZP1C9K", "B005H4IIAS", "B00023P4RE", "B004SUDQ8G", "B004CTG6TO", "B003O2H7MA", "B0007TKHFW", "B001O2UTRW", "B0072BNJZ8", "B00CZ7AL32", "B000H1RFPA", "B00007GZR1", "B00AEBB9YQ", "B0000CBY1C", "B00AEFYT1W", "076780676X", "B00008MTW2", "B00KGLS050", "B00143XE1O", "B003ZXNCAE", "B00077BPFU", "B0033PSHAO", "B00005JLJC", "B009L4DSXM", "B000JJSJPK", "B001BSBBDK", "B00005UM23", "B000JF5T5W", "0767827651", "B000EU1Q1S", "B00EKGX2P0", "B004NWOC1E", "B001TKUXVQ", "B000059GEI", "B008L3650W", "B0017CW5H6", "B004VUNVEM", "B005GZ2CWS", "B0033PSH7W", "B009L4DSV4", "B000FZETR0", "B0015FGCI8", "B00GOC752E", "B00008MTW0", "B000056MMM", "B00178T3Q6", "B0002B15ZG", "B001LPWGH8", "B0009X75WE", "B00008LDNZ", "B005ET4NHI", "B005R2SHIS", "B00507O3II", "B00143XE0K", "B003B3O5GS", "B0008ENID4", "B000HT3PGK", "B000XT1P5C", "B003M3A86I"], "bought_together": ["B002CAWNFQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0006FO8PC", "B00007J5VN", "B0010AN7Z4", "B002CAWNFQ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 31822}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 24.99, "brand": "MACLAINE,SHIRLEY", "asin": "B00066FB8Y", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RXW8MG4NL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "What a Way to Go!"}

{"description": "In the irreverent tradition ofMy Favorite MartianandMork and Mindy, Bonnie and Terry Turner (That &#x91;70s Show) created3rd Rock From the Sun. Launched in 1996 as a midseason replacement, the alien comedy ran for six seasons, garnering 31 Emmy nominations and eight wins, including three for John Lithgow and two for Kristen Johnston.In the pilot (\"Brains and Eggs\"), four extra-terrestrials suddenly materialize in the college town of Rutherford, Ohio. Disguised as humans, they dub themselves the Solomons. They are Dick (Lithgow), Sally (Johnston), Tommy (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), and Harry (French Stewart). On the surface, Dick is a physics professor and Tommy is his hormonally challenged 14-year-old son. In reality, Dick is the high commander, Tommy (who's actually the oldest) is the senior information officer, Sally (who's actually a man) is the lieutenant, and squinty-eyed Harry is the transmitter/receiver. The humans in their lives include Dick's colleague--and object of his affections--Mary (Jane Curtin,Kate and Allie), secretary Nina (Simbi Khali), and landlady Mrs. Dubcek (Elmarie Wendel). The first season also introduces Officer Don (Wayne Knight,Seinfeld), who will appear more often in future seasons.There were 20 episodes in the first year. In each, the Solomons learn something new about the human condition. In the debut, it&#x92;s feelings. Dick finds them silly, until he realizes how essential they are--you can't be fully human without them. Then there's sportsmanship (\"Green-Eyed Dick\"), mortality (\"Body & Soul & Dick\"), and so on. Guest stars include Harry's dream girl, Martha Stewart (\"Post-Nasal Dick\"),The Gilmore Girls&#x92; Lauren Graham (\"Dick's First Birthday\"), andNewsradio&#x92;s Phil Hartman (\"Lonely Dick\"). After the show&#x92;s demise, the cast would move on to other ventures, most notably Broadway hitDirty Rotten Scoundrelsfor the versatile Lithgow and independent dramaMysterious Skinfor the grown-up Gordon-Levitt.--Kathleen C.

{"description": "From Hollywood's legendary Cocoanut Grove to the pioneering conquest of the wild blue yonder, Martin Scorsese'sThe Aviatorcelebrates old-school filmmaking at its finest. We say \"old school\" only because Scorsese's love of golden-age Hollywood is evident in his approach to his subject--Howard Hughes in his prime (played by Leonardo DiCaprio in his)--and especially in his technical mastery of the medium reflecting his love for classical filmmaking of the studio era. Even when he's using state-of-the-art digital trickery for the film's exciting flight scenes (including one of the most spectacular crashes ever filmed), Scorsese's meticulous attention to art direction and costume design suggests an impassioned pursuit of craftsmanship from a bygone era; every frame seems to glow with gilded detail. And while DiCaprio bears little physical resemblance to Hughes during the film's 20-year span (late 1920s to late '40s), he efficiently captures the eccentric millionaire's golden-boy essence, and his tragic descent into obsessive-compulsive seclusion. Bolstered by Cate Blanchett's uncannily accurate portrayal of Katharine Hepburn as Hughes' most beloved lover,The Aviatoris easily Scorsese's most accessible film, inviting mainstream popularity without compromising Scorsese's artistic reputation. As compelling crowd-pleasers go, it's a class act from start to finish.--Jeff ShannonDVD FeaturesIn his commentary track, director Martin Scorsese offers his own impressions of Howard Hughes and rattles off his memories of experiencing Hughes's films.  He mentions how he made Cate Blanchett watch every Katharine Hepburn film from the '30s on the big screen, and observes that Kate Beckinsale had \"a real sense of the stature of a Hollywood goddess.\"  But in general he doesn't talk much about the craft of making the film.  That area is covered better by editor Thelma Schoonmaker, who also appears on the commentary track, and producer Michael Mann makes a few appearances (all were recorded separately).  The picture is brilliant, but the 5.1 sound is not as aggressive in the rear speakers and subwoofer as one might expect, other than some nice surround effects in theHell's Angelsflying sequence.The second disc collects almost three hours of features.  There's one unnecessary deleted scene, and an 11-minute making-of featurette that's basically the cast and director heaping praise on each other.  More interesting are the short featurettes on visual effects (including the XF-11 scene, of course), production design, costumes, hair and makeup, and score, and Loudon Wainwright discusses his and his children's musical performances.  Historical perspective is provided by spotlights on Hughes's role in aviation and his obsessive-compulsive disorder, and a 43-minute Hughes documentary from the History Channel (part of the Modern Marvels series, it focuses on his mechanical innovations and spends less than a minute on his movies).  More unusual are DiCaprio and Scorsese's appearance on an OCD panel, and a half-hour interview segment DiCaprio did with Alan Alda.--David HoriuchiThe Personalities ofThe AviatorClick the links to explore more movies by these stars.Leonardo DiCaprioasHoward Hughes\"Sometimes I truly fear that I... am losing my mind.

Disguised as teachers, policemen, sportswriters--whatever the Boss assigns--Jonathan and Mark use their gifts to reunite broken families, comfort the sick, and guide those souls in need of love and redemption back to their truest selves.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00GOC75V0", "B00BUWD7NE", "B00JDCP0QA", "B0007TKHFM", "B0002ERWVE", "B000BYRCGA", "B000HWZ4L6", "B00EOBB6DQ", "B00CKYHH5A", "B00ISZNCKE", "B00B58FWGI", "B00ENFS0FK", "B00HVFA39A", "B001JAHPMG", "B002C6A6N6", "B008F283XG", "B000GIXCFQ", "B005D7E7Y0", "B007ZR9H5K", "B008KZX766", "B00LT1JHLW", "B00KW02JW0", "B00KYCA4QY", "B00L16P1YM", "B00KTZALDC", "B005F96UP0", "B00009QG5P", "B000AA4KQ0", "B00CD45JDE", "B00KO72X4K", "B00HQLZCIQ", "B007V973KI", "B00HZMZ286", "B0002WZS9Y", "B000VDDE04", "B00H8KC1N4", "B0007WFXIK", "B00I458456", "B00IU6HPIQ", "B00016JE5U", "B00I86MQF0", "B000LV6W0A", "B00DXLO086", "B000EHSVB4", "B0002KVUS4", "B00GLPYVQC", "B00650RX72", "B00DXLO0BI", "B00HVFA36I", "B00069FKZU", "B0001WNL2G", "B00DYQ1GBE", "B006363QHE", "B000FBFYXM", "B00KDK64DY", "B00JEZWRE4", "B00JHH1VDC", "B003XJABZO", "B0000C2IVT", "B00BF0SKKQ", "B00A73ANHA", "B00IS6WQ2S", "B0002I838Q", "B00650RWGO", "B00GM1X2RO", "B0002NY81C", "B00CL151P0", "B00DXLO0D6", "B0001DMXEC", "B00JU3S7Z8", "B0076ANKS6", "B00ESK1PES", "B00J9BZ4KC", "B004HJ0ZP0", "B003IB0FTE", "B003W5C0TY", "B004PQM81E", "B00F4CIPRE", "B00KB01OG8", "B00ET6LPRI", "B00HRUQA6O", "B00I87U9H6", "B005LFQRTC", "B00I87U8UE", "B005HWAOH0", "B002L9N500", "B00005JO3P", "B003XL6EI0", "B00E8AVN9U", "B00AMU8K8C", "B00IF0KAYS", "B002ZTLVXY", "B0055SJX4Q", "B001F7AQDS", "B00A4F59XY", "B00KB01N4G", "B0030Y120K", "B0012Q3SZ0", "B000N2HD6O", "B0079IEPHK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00JDCP0QA", "B00BUWD7NE", "B00GOC75V0", "B00009QG5P"]}, "price": 8.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 174270}, "asin": "B0009ZE9DK", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515TGGYQX9L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Highway to Heaven - Season Two"}

{"description": "Movie studios, by and large, avoid controversial subjects like race the way you might avoid a hive of angry bees. So it's remarkable thatCrasheven got made; that it's a rich, intelligent, and moving exploration of the interlocking lives of a dozen Los Angeles residents--black, white, latino, Asian, and Persian--is downright amazing. A politically nervous district attorney (Brendan Fraser) and his high-strung wife (Sandra Bullock, biting into a welcome change of pace fromMiss Congeniality) get car-jacked by an oddly sociological pair of young black men (Larenz Tate and Chris \"Ludacris\" Bridges); a rich black T.V. director (Terrence Howard) and his wife (Thandie Newton) get pulled over by a white racist cop (Matt Dillon) and his reluctant partner (Ryan Phillipe); a detective (Don Cheadle) and his Latina partner and lover (Jennifer Esposito) investigate a white cop who shot a black cop--these are only three of the interlocking stories that reach up and down class lines. Writer/director Paul Haggis (who wrote the screenplay forMillion Dollar Baby) spins every character in unpredictable directions, refusing to let anyone sink into a stereotype. The cast--ranging from the famous names above to lesser-known but just as capable actors like Michael Pena (Buffalo Soldiers) and Loretta Devine (Woman Thou Art Loosed)--meets the strong script head-on, delivering galvanizing performances in short vignettes, brief glimpses that build with gut-wrenching force.

{"description": "By Season Six, theSeinfeldcrew had their formula and character development down pat making it easy to churn out one classic episode after another.  Not only do we learn a lot about Jerry (Jerry Seinfeld), George (Jason Alexander), Elaine (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) and Kramer (Michael Richards) in Season Six, but we also learn wealth of life lessons. For instance, just because you wear a toupee doesn&#x92;t mean you won't be rejected by bald women (\"The Beard\"). If you think everyone is giving you the finger, they probably are (\"The Pledge Drive\"). As ridicurous as is sounds, just because a woman has a Chinese name doesn't make her Chinese (\"The Chinese Woman\"). Eating out of trash is AOK, as long as your girlfriend's mother doesn't catch you (\"The Gymnast\"). If you try to make the \"switch\" and date your girlfriend's room mate, you just may get more than you bargained for (\"The Switch\"). If someone offers you an Armani suit in exchange for a meal, make sure you tell them that soup is indeed a meal (\"The Soup\").  Just because you are a \"beard,\"  doesn't mean you are dating (\"The Beard\"). Bringing crib notes in the bedroom may not be the best idea (\"The Fusilli Jerry\").

{"description": "Live performances by two very different groups led by the late Frank Zappa are the main attraction ofDub Room Special, a relatively rare DVD offering from one of contemporary music's most prolific and hard-to-classify figures. There were always two sides to Zappa (who died in 1993), from serious composer/musician to potty-mouthed frat boy, from innovator, iconoclast, and provocateur to juvenile shtick-meister. Both are on display here, but while there's plenty of fooling around, onstage and off, in the end it's Zappa's music that makes the more profound impression. The earlier of the two performances, recorded in 1974 and entitled \"A Token of His Extreme,\" finds George Duke (keyboards), Chester Thompson (drums), the zany Napoleon Murphy Brock (woodwinds), and Ruth Underwood (mallet percussion) joining the guitarist for renditions of \"Montana,\" \"Florentine Pogen,\" \"Inca Roads,\" and others, all showcasing both Zappa's warped sense of humor and the remarkable complexity and avant-garde flavor of his compositions; this is arguably the best band he ever assembled, and perhaps the best visual record of a Zappa gig. The second show, from Halloween 1981, is less distinguished. The musicians, though far less prominent than those from the earlier group (with the exception of hotshot guitarist Steve Vai), are excellent, but the material is weaker, and the entire proceeding is marred by \"Stevie's Spanking,\" a moronic ode to Vai's visit with a kinky groupie. Elsewhere, Bruce Bickford's stop motion clay animation (also featured throughoutBaby Snakes, a 2003 Zappa DVD release) is clever but somewhat overused; and there's little excuse for the bits featuring Italian \"journalist\" Massimo Bassoli (whose main talent seems to be picking his nose) or the inclusion of the very dated \"Valley Girl\" documentary, featuring Zappa's daughter Moon Unit.--Sam Graham", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00CA4S2PO", "B0043E8Y48", "B0000JML7G", "B000OCXM0O", "B0000E2W05", "B001JL2UXE", "B00104AZ5U", "B002TBZCTM", "B008I34ZUM", "B001502LNI", "B00919V30C", "B008I34Y6W", "B00919V32K", "B008BDZP08", "B008I34ZHU", "B008XNPMEK", "B008I34YFS", "B00919V2ZS", "B008I34Z8E", "0671705725", "B008PPUMVY", "B00919V2XK", "B008PPUNF4", "B008BYDAA4", "B00GGZ818Q", "B008I34ZQG", "B008PPUN6I", "B00A92MDH2", "B008BYDACW", "B008BDZOZ4", "B008PPUMYQ", "B008I34YCG", "B008I34ZL6", "B008B37CB8", "B008I34ZG6", "B008PPUN3Q", "B008BDZP3K", "B00347ZXYY", "B008I34ZCU", "B00133FOKE", "B00919V34I", "1905177569", "B008B37C4U", "B008I34Y3A", "B008B37C8Q", "B00919V33E", "B0000009TU", "B00919V366", "B008XNPLXW", "B008YY9A3W", "B000AM6N9U", "B008BDZP26", "B009GGWX7M", "B0000009TN", "B008YCFSGC", "B000003OVE", "B0000009TO"], "bought_together": ["B0043E8Y48", "B00CA4S2PO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00CA4S2PO", "B000OCXM0O", "B0043E8Y48", "B001JL2UXE"]}, "price": 9.99, "categories": [["CDs & Vinyl", "Alternative Rock"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Rock"], ["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 237477}, "asin": "B000BC8SW4", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51A8WHGTK6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Frank Zappa: Dub Room Special"}
{"description": "TheKing Kong - Peter Jackson's Production Diariesis an impressive set geared directly toward fans, collectors, and those interested in the film-making process.  In all likelihood Peter Jackson and co. are going to release aKing Kongset bulging with extras, so why buy the \"extras\" now? Fair question.  However, if you're aching with anticipation for a major glimpse into the 6-month production process of this modern day extravaganza, theKing Kong - Peter Jackson's Production Diariesis an absolute \"must have.\"  Housed in a sturdy, faux clip board complete with a 52-page production memoir and art prints, this two DVD set opens up a three and a half hour window into what goes on in the making of a major blockbuster film. The bulk of the footage consists of the 54 \"production diaries\" (which can be sorted and viewed by production date or production location) culled from the \"Kong is King\" website. These hand held video diaries are candid peeks into the complex, humorous, detailed and involved world of the movie making process. There are a lot of Peter Jackson interviews, but over the six month time frame you eventually hear from every single person involved in the film--actors, the WETA team, animal trainers, assistant camera people, lighting technician, set crews, miniatures, make-up, etc. It is safe to say that not a stone is left unturned in revealing what goes on behind the scenes on a major motion picture set. Extremely careful not to give anything away, theKing Kong - Peter Jackson's Production Diaries, though heavy in the production process, is very light on showing the final product. Nothing is revealed to ruin the movie experience. Well, almost nothing. One bonus video diary is \"The Making of a Shot - The T-Rex Fight.\" In this 16 minutes diary you get to witness what goes on in creating the chilling \"T-Rex Fight\" from conception to special effects construction to the final jaw-dropping product. It is amazing to see two years of work unfold before your very eyes in two and a half minutes.--Rob Bracco", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000H30B2C", "B001KZVQJI", "B00L9K2EGS", "B001GKJ2E8", "B00KUS5YGC", "B00L3ZB7JO", "B00KDU8HQQ", "B000QXDED6", "B00ION69AK", "B00E5QTWLI", "B0013FDM7E", "B001F7MSFM", "B0013FBS20", "B00JKQSIG8", "B001FB55H6", "B00DOB3N56", "B00C7E3E7S", "B00KCTG4PO", "B0000AMRJE", "B002O3Z50Q", "1783290943", "1557836698", "B008L0YMSW", "B00IF8Q0YE", "B001F7MSG6", "B000OVLBF8", "B00HT2RTU6", "B000AMJG4Y", "B001KVZ6LQ", "0547898703", "B000ZELISO", "1608873447", "B002VWNIAY", "0760344760", "B005CM1IES", "B001GZ6QC4", "0062265687", "B001DPHDI8", "B003ZHR6PW", "0062265695", "B0087F7VSY", "B008UZ94F4", "B0002O7XW2", "B00275EDYA", "B00AEFXNLY", "B007ZQHUYQ", "B0050G3NWG", "0618154019", "B008X8VM1W", "B000FFJZO2", "B0000VD04M", "054789855X", "B0025VLEMK", "B00005JMQW", "B00AEFYS8G", "B007KW5N9Y", "B008UZBHYU", "B004QSQML8", "B004SIP9Z6", "B00DYEN6XC", "B00GST8UB8", "1416505180", "B0058S0OMS", "B00E8S2JZ4", "B007RG9LMS", "B001AQO3XS", "B001AGXEA6", "B00CNW9ZEU", "B004RKXW0E", "0062082841", "1557041393", "1593074727", "B000CS1Z6S"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000H30B2C", "B000EHQTZO", "B00AEFYEU8", "B001GKJ2E8"]}, "price": 7.18, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 125459}, "asin": "B000BMSUJK", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41F83HEH8NL._SX300_.jpg", "title": "King Kong - Peter Jackson's Production Diaries"}

After a calamitous falling out, the two sisters travel a bumpy road toward true appreciation for one another--aided along the way by the discovery of the maternal grandmother they thought was dead. Through their re-connection with their grandmother, Ella, Maggie and Rose learn how to make peace with themselves and with each other.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000069HYG", "B000MQC9H4", "B000OCZA04", "B000EMGJ7C", "B0009OL7Z4", "B00005JN3W", "0743418204", "B000J103OI", "B0038N9WKU", "B004EPZ070", "B000A343RI", "B0041KKYGU", "B0001AVZA8", "B00KNALRZ4", "B00AEBB9FA", "B00164KYV4", "B000GB775E", "B004SIP8WU", "B001TUZD8O", "B00AKGG6JS", "B0015I2RT8", "B0000797IO", "B00AEBB8YW", "B00005JPSM", "6305499144", "B0013ERFGE", "B002ZG989G", "B00005JL7Q", "B001OQCV1K", "B000YAA68C", "B008KEQMDC", "B00CC3464E", "6305212112", "B0000VD02Y", "B00005BKZE", "B0006GANPA", "B00AEFXYOA", "B0006D3HCE", "B002P413IC", "B00AEBB9LO", "B000BFO064", "B004LWZW9C", "B000765IJK", "B00AEFYHVO", "B004SUDQ2W", "B000YAF4MA", "B000E6EHE0", "B004SIP8LG", "B00005JPT0", "B004IK30PA", "B003EYVXXC", "B000EHRVOW", "B000BNX3B4", "B004SEUJOQ", "B007HRKBI0", "B00AEBB8NS", "B001AKTZW8", "6305213283", "B000067J24", "B000ZM1MG4", "B001C5LLQ4", "B002GIBVWA", "B000HCPS94", "B003TY2SWC", "B000LXHK2C", "B000EDWKXI", "B00AEFYXJ0", "B000KX0IO0", "B00006FMUW", "B000N0W9WO", "B000P0J0EW", "B00803PG2G", "B00008NRI7", "B00004UEDQ", "B00005JLYW", "B002ZG98RS", "B001WAKOW6", "B0041KKYHE", "B002LBKDZI", "B000NNUX10", "B00008G7UF", "B002ZG98FU", "B0000DIXDR", "B004SIP9RO", "B000023VTP", "B005LAIHE0", "B004L3AR0K", "B004EPZ0BG", "B004SIP9VA", "B0035Q637K", "B00012QL14", "B00002SSKI", "B002ZG9968", "B000YDBPAM", "B002K0WBXW", "B003B3V0N4", "B005OUL7Q2", "B00005JG6N", "B00005JNQA", "B000T988I8"], "bought_together": ["B000MQC9H4", "B0009OL7Z4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000MQC9H4", "B000069HYG", "B00H9HZITU", "B0021L8UO4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 127218}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 19.21, "brand": "Twentieth Century Fox", "asin": "B000CCW2OS", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514XP8P0ATL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "In Her Shoes"}

{"description": "Rescue Meis a wake up call for every man who (as a kid) dreamed about becoming a fireman and every woman who fantasized about being with one. As flawed and complicated as they are selfless and heroic, the fire fighters in this FX series are a compelling lot. They deal with infidelity, drug addiction, and sexual abuse on a daily basis and make it seem like old hat. But the characters are so well thought out that they almost always make viewers care about what's developing in their lives.  This second season surpasses the debut year in terms of story lines and pacing. Series creator Denis Leary (Ice Age,No Cure for Cancer) reprises his role of Tommy Gavin. Separated from his wife and children and also battling a drinking addiction, Tommy is now working as the new guy in a Staten Island firehouse. He isn't a hero so much as he's his own best victim. Luckily, he's still got some loyal friends who're quick to nip his pity-parties short:  \"You feeling a little angry? You feeling a little hurt? You feeling betrayed? Well, congratulations, you're feeling, and you're feeling because you're sober.\" With his hangdog features and fast-paced speech pattern, Leary is surprisingly believable in the role. Returning character Chief Reilly (Jack McGee) faces some struggles of his own, as he watches his wife's spiral downward thanks to Alzheimer's. And it's not much easier for Franco (Daniel Sunjata), who is trying to figure out the best ways to care for his daughter while working an unpredictable schedule. While the drama on this show can sometimes be fiery and intense, the series provides enough biting humor to lend it an air of humanity and, at times, even a little warmth. It doesn't leave viewers wanting to be fire fighters, but rather empathizing with them.--Jae-Ha Kim", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000OIOOVE", "B0008JIJ1A", "B00166647K", "B003CPPY5G", "B0036TGTF2", "B002NPCE7M", "B002E9FMOE", "B0009IW88K", "B0001O3YLM", "B0012CJQZ0", "B000FUTVLO", "B0012CJQYQ", "B0012CJQZA", "B0020TS5EM", "B0015TX2LO", "B0012CJQYG", "B000QUTTPG", "B0012CJQY6", "B0007NN6JC", "B000OIOOUU", "B00005JNJ1", "B002DQSKME", "B001AQT158", "B000YW8RPE", "B000E3L7F0", "B000FIMG5Y", "B000N3T0EG", "B000P6YNSO", "B003LXM1B4", "B00005JO9J", "B0013FSL16", "B0016MOWQ4", "B003CN5SAY", "B001QE99AQ", "B000FKO3GW", "B0006L0L5C", "B00KHA99BY", "B001PQZYQI", "B000RO6JY0", "B0025KVKDE", "B001OQCVCE", "B0058JEHSO", "B0018CWEZI", "B0002XEEAM", "B009VXVMAO", "B000GG4Y28", "B001934SNM", "B000RW3VDE", "B000R7HRRA", "B001MVWRNE", "B00188XHFI", "B000YABIQ6", "B0007YMVWO", "B0000E5NPY", "B0058JEHTS", "B0018CWEVW", "B003LXM1PK", "B000067S1G", "B000Q6GUKW", "B003L77GK6", "B009PNGBWY", "B001RTSPVY", "B000EWBNMS", "B0024FAR66", "B000FFJYE8", "B000ICLRKC", "B008H6GHF6", "B0018RKEQE", "B00005NOHO", "B001DJLCRC", "B001NXDIMK", "B00188XHF8", "B004HW7JNS", "B00003CXOP", "B00079FUI6", "B00HI9QGCC", "B0002XVQSU", "B002N5N5QQ", "B000FIMG68", "B00000FBH2", "B0038M2APA", "B00023P4FG", "B002ZCY80O", "B0007QS324", "B00DXP7L88", "B000EXDS7K", "B004TJ1GY2", "B0058YPGSY", "B004STBF2G", "B000G6BL88", "B000RO6JZY", "B00CG4XKNM", "B000GB75CO", "B0024F08RO", "B000FVQLIO", "B00CT48W14", "B00DJYJRHG", "B0002V7TZQ", "B000GH3CWK", "B000H7JCGE"], "bought_together": ["B000OIOOVE", "B0008JIJ1A"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B008H6GHF6", "B0008JIJ1A", "B0036TGTF2", "B00166647K"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 26577}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 13.83, "brand": "Columbia Tri Star", "asin": "B000ENUYGI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/512X1YMMX0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Rescue Me: Season 2"}
{"description": "Cheri Oteri breathed bracing fresh air into the seasons she appeared onSaturday Night Live, and created memorable characters both absurd and delightful. This 78-minute disc contains samples of some of her signature performances, including the preternaturally peppy cheerleader, Arianna, paired with a strapping Will Ferrell. (Ever tried to lead a cheer at the team's&#x85;swim meet? Arianna never met a challenge she couldn't conquer.)  Oteri also takes on media icon Barbara Walters, satirized decades earlier by the incomparable Gilda Radner as Baba Wawa. Oteri's impersonation both pays homage to Radner's and takes it to a new level of absurdity; Oteri's Walters is a randy, name-dropping old coot who doesn't miss a beat--or an opportunity to aggrandize herself (\"I was horseback riding the other day with Saddam Hussein&#x85;\"). Don't miss the brief skit where Walters tries to have phone sex with a nonplussed Tom Brokaw.

{"description": "Three months before the much-publicized theatrical release ofUnited 93, the same true-life tragedy was faithfully dramatized inFlight 93, an equally praiseworthy TV movie that was originally broadcast on the A&E; network on January 30, 2006. The fourth plane to be hijacked on September 11th, 2001 &#x96; and the only plane that didn't reach its intended terrorist target &#x96; is the riveting subject of this film, which unfolds in real-time (similar but not identical toUnited 93), beginning with the terrorists' preparations and boarding of the ill-fated flight. We then follow the notorious events as they unfold, and from that moment on, it's nearly impossible to take your eyes off the screen. The intense drama focuses on the passengers who ultimately thwarted the terrorists &#x96; they include Tom Burnett (Jeffrey Nordling), Todd Beamer (Brennan Elliot), and Mark Bingham (Ty Olsson) &#x96; but as their counter-attack plans are being made, the action also reveals the chaotic nature of the ground response, from the White House bunker (where Vice President Cheney was moved for security) to Offices of the Federal Aviation Agency, Verizon headquarters (where in-flight calls were monitored), and United Airlines flight control, where pilots and terrorists alike could be heard throughout the terrible ordeal of the hijacking.To his credit, director Peter Markle steers clear from any sense of exploitation (it helps that there was a five-year gap between the 9/11 tragedy and this respectable film); furthermore, both Markle and screenwriter Nevin Schreiner avoid the pitfalls of melodrama by keeping the action rooted in the facts as we know them. Speculation is necessary for some of the dramatic details, butFlight 93benefits from a well-chosen cast of unknowns, which enhances our belief in them as ordinary citizens under extraordinary circumstances. As you might expect, several scenes are inherently unforgettable (up to and including the now heroic phrase \"Let's roll!\" as the counter-attack begins), and the authentically played emotions are further intensified by realistic special effects by Gary Gutierrez, who performed similarly laudable duties onThe Right Stuff23 years earlier, at the start of his visual effects career. Produced with the cooperation of surviving family members of those who perished on Flight 93, this well-made TV film handles difficult material with grace under pressure, and that alone serves as an admirable tribute to those brave passengers who gave their lives so that others could be saved.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000GH3CR0", "B000JLTRIQ", "B001F5274G", "B004WCSMDE", "B007N31XIU", "B00006BS70", "B005KBJC0I", "B004X7UAMO", "B000FUF6QI", "B0009IW89Y", "B00827OX5Q", "B000GPCB5Q", "B000JMK6LM", "B00063MCHA", "B00006B1HI", "B0006L0L5C", "B000C4STMA", "0842374183", "B00AZNEW5G", "B00BNAE14W", "0783225733", "B0027OJBQG", "B0031RAOY6", "B00003CXTG", "B007SPPANM", "B002GLG5OQ", "B000M4RG42", "188127375X", "B00005J760", "B000ELL1R6", "B000B8QG22", "B00C7BZX34", "B00005JM0O", "B008JFUNKU", "B00GPWEPZ8", "B00000I1JZ", "B004O26LAI", "B00AFEXRME", "B002GIBVVG", "B000XJD37U", "B000EHSVSC", "B003BV8ICM", "B005LSJ0SO", "B0001US66Y", "B00008K7AQ", "6305767866", "B002O3Z50G", "B000F4RHT8", "B000BITUKC", "B0032LV4MM", "B004SEUJ82", "B00HEUXKOC", "B0055SJXCI", "B002PTVMWO", "B000OYAT3U", "B00019330O", "1426208073", "B0002F6AJI", "B00AFEYS9A", "B00AEFYENK", "B0013BM63O", "B005IG5K6A", "B00022FWTA", "B006ZGRNVM", "B000BYY11Y", "B001TUZG4K", "B000E991KM", "B009AMANBA", "B000JBXHQY", "B002JCSWV6", "B00000G3PA", "B00001ZWUS", "B00A34LX2M", "B0013XZ71K", "B00006LPHJ", "B005LAIGYQ", "B00008MTVZ", "B00005Y1UV", "B00EV4EUT8", "B00005PJ8T", "B00005PJ8S", "B004AOECXI", "B00005TPC7", "B001KGDNAW", "B00AHTYI5M", "B000765IJK", "B00AEBB89W", "B001IHJ97Y", "B000Z8GZYW", "B00D3LA6AW", "B000A0GP0Y", "B000UNYK4E", "B00004W4UD", "B00004XPPE", "B000N3T0EG", "B00028HBKM", "B0018CWW5K", "B00004TJKK", "B0007LXPBI"], "bought_together": ["B000GH3CR0", "B001F5274G"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000GH3CR0", "B000JLTRIQ", "B001F5274G", "B004X7UAMO"]}, "price": 7.98, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 47290}, "asin": "B000EYJHDS", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51XuS2ra44L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Flight 93: The Movie"}

But when Estrada is gunned down under mysterious circumstances, Perkins takes justice into his own hands and kidnaps a trigger-happy border patrolman (Barry Pepper - Saving Private Ryan), forcing Perkins to unearth Estrada's body and accompany Perkins on horseback on the long and treacherous journey through the frontier mountains and back roads of Mexico to bring his friend's body home.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0002J4X2K", "B001NFNFIK", "B0011V7PSC", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00A92MF6Q", "B00005LMAL", "B000NOIVT0", "B00009RDG9", "B007FQXEXW", "B000GIW9I2", "6305504024", "B000CRQYTC", "B00002E20R", "B00003CXGV", "B0018PH3L0", "B00J5G1P2W", "B000BT96DM", "B0010DR4BO", "B002S5N052", "B000059XTH", "0792835727", "B00A92MD8G", "B005NGKMOU", "B004SEUJOQ", "B000059H7K", "B0041KKZGY", "B0045HCJTO", "B009INAI02", "B003UESJME", "B003VADSJG", "B0007MAO0C", "B000XR9L50", "B00AEBB9CS", "B004W7D2A2", "B003NF97MQ", "B00096S4DK", "B001LRJH0U", "B0096W46SK", "B00F3TDA6O", "B00368PSKK", "B000GFRI4K", "B0000TANUI", "B000EOTUSU", "B00IKM5OCO", "B006LL3W0W", "B000K7VHNW", "B00AEFYPHA", "B000B6CO48", "B00AEFYSEA", "B0008ENHUS", "B0000694Y3", "B00005LOL2", "B003AWRMCE", "B00083FZFY", "B007PXYWNQ", "B00136MBV6", "B00005LOL5", "B000F48D3M", "B003498SCQ", "B006OALDLA", "B00J0IN6Z4", "B00049QJ9I", "B00IO03I6Q", "B000A59Q00", "B007UW9WMS", "B00393SG0G", "B00005QCVU", "B00AEBB932", "B00HOGBXS6", "B00AEFXFW6", "0790736411", "B001UV4XRY", "B007C4ZJ0S", "B00CZB9BE8", "B000BITVBA", "B0001FGBW0", "B00GMV8IVE", "B00368PSKU", "B00008YJDK", "B004SIP6VI", "B0007OY2NA", "B001B187NO", "B00AEBB8W4", "B000QUCNOK", "B0007R4T3K", "B000031EGW", "B00AEFYL6K", "B000EHSVUU", "B003UESJEM", "B00BEIYKX0", "B000056H2K", "B0001CNRRU", "B0014BQR24", "B000W1SZBS", "B0007MANYY", "B003EYVXTG", "B00005JKJA", "6305364559", "B004AOECXI", "B00005AX6G"], "bought_together": ["B0002J4X2K", "B001NFNFIK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001AZW73M", "B0002J4X2K", "B001NFNFIK", "B00A92MF6Q"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 21558}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.74, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B000F8O2QU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51V9JGE2G4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada"}

{"description": "The rediscovery and restoration of any film long believed lost is good news.Beyond the Rocksinspired still more excitement at the 2005 Cannes Film Festival because it was the only movie ever to costar two of the silent era's highest-wattage luminaries: Gloria Swanson and Rudolph Valentino.Cultural clich&#xE9; holds that Swanson's acting was as garish as her makeup, and the legend of Valentino is awash in camp.  Yet in this picture--however preposterously plotted by Elinor (It) Glyn--both deliver very natural performances of behavioral subtlety and discretion. Swanson, as the loving daughter of a retired officer (Alec B. Francis), is willing to do anything to ensure that Papa's twilight years be comfortable.  That includes marrying a much older, vulgar businessman (Robert Bolder) as wealthy as he is unappealing.  It's inconvenient that she's just fallen for a dashing nobleman (Valentino) who's saved her from (1) drowning and (2) falling off an Alp.  Both these beautiful people struggle to behave honorably, right up through a final reel in which the unsympathetic husband takes them--and the audience--by surprise.Now, we mustn't make overmuch of a good thing:Beyond the Rocks, ably but unexcitingly directed by Sam Wood, isn't a lost Murnau or the uncutGreed.  But it's a very respectable movie, free of the excesses (except Swanson's increasingly florid costumes!) carelessly attributed to silent films in general; and as a long-delayed footnote to two legendary careers, its historical importance is considerable.  The Nederlands Filmmuseum restoration is gloriously sharp (apart from a few spasms of almost impenetrable nitrate deterioration), and the new score by Henny Vrienten sounds more like Mark Isham than the organ-and-calliope accompaniment too many silents have suffered from.--Richard T.

{"description": "The hook-wielding Fisherman returns in the third installment of the popular teen-horror franchise based on Lois Duncan's novelI Know What You Did Last Summer. Jennifer Love Hewitt, who top-billed the previous entries, is nowhere to be found in this film, and the action has been moved from a fishing village to a Colorado ski community where a gaggle of attractive teens led by Amber (Brooke Nevin) are wrapped up in a prank gone wrong which again results in an unfortunate death. The friends commit to keeping the accident silent, until they are plagued by mysterious messages that implicate them in the murder. What follows is the standard stalk-and-slash, with the Fisherman (played here by Don Shanks) dispatching the guilty parties with a modicum of bloody special effects, until the inevitable showdown. Director Sylvian White, an acclaimed music-video helmer, pulls out all the visual stops to deliver a \"cutting edge\" thriller, but the story itself was drained of any interest by the two previous films, and what's left is a empty exercise in flashy excess that may prove a passing entertainment for teen viewers seeking a good excuse to scream (and snuggle). The DVD includes a making-of featurette and an anemic, tech-minded commentary track by White.--Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305300801", "6305017115", "B000A5045Q", "B005CFBYW6", "B004LWZW2O", "0767824954", "B0009MWEM6", "B0009MWELW", "B003PIUINS", "B004EPZ08O", "B0000541TL", "B004SIP9MY", "B00JF5GAIW", "B004SIP9P6", "B005OK722U", "B000099T3M", "B004SIP9O2", "B00CAATSME", "B000UJ48P4", "0767802497", "B000PMLJMQ", "B004AC6PV2", "B00006LPHA", "B000F6IOAM", "B004P7CN7W", "B000FA57US", "B00275EHDM", "B00005JMDZ", "B00275EHFU", "B00AEFY37C", "B005CFC0N8", "B000EHRVP6", "B000WC389G", "B004P7CM9Q", "B00003CXUP", "B003ZZ7TPG", "B000KJU1KK", "B00DTPRZ24", "B00BM4Q4H6", "B00006FDBT", "B000RIWAVW", "B004AC6PMG", "B002YICNE2", "B00DTPRZ10", "B000FA57UI", "B000VKL6Z2", "B000AM4P9K", "B00JMLQGQ0", "B004SUDQ1I", "B000CCBC9O", "B0002JP572", "B003PIUINI", "B000RGN2JI", "B0000VCZMK", "B002I41KNC", "B0000AOX09", "B004P7CNUY", "B0000APVJ0", "B00004XPPI", "B00018D42W", "B00CERJI5U", "B0000CEB6Y", "B001YYQ9S8", "B001GCUO4S", "B000056T5E", "B005GT3X68", "B001P3SA9Y", "B001NPD9LS", "0792840127", "B00009WVSL", "B0020PFYHC", "B004LWZW2Y", "B0001LJCKC", "B001KEHAEO", "B00AIZ2FPK", "B002XD0J80", "B00DTPRYY8", "B000MM0LIM", "B00006FI0R", "B00AZMFINM", "B004TI35YC", "B000EHSVLE", "B00AEFYGBA", "B00000F0AD", "B00005JLKN", "B003Q6D27S", "B000055WFZ", "B000FOQ1KY", "B00AQJ8MLY", "B008MXMFVE", "B002AS45VK", "B000FC2HS6", "B00IVLRA9E", "B000FS9FE4", "B004SIP9I8", "B0057YUV6C", "B00003CWRF", "B001L9EXUC", "B00B96TGQS"], "bought_together": ["6305300801", "6305017115"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000A5045Q", "6305300801", "B005CFBYW6", "6305017115"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 150206}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.54, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B000FSME9M", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514QuGIu1EL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "I'll Always Know What You Did Last Summer"}
{"description": "The sixth and final season of HBO's prison dramaOz--which aired in 2003--is brutal, passionate, and gritty. Compellingly addictive with taut storylines and superb acting, each of the eight episodes on this 3-disc set nicely paves the way for the series finale, which wraps the show up in a satisfying (and surprising) manner. Often told through the eyes (and voice) of deceased prisoner Augustus Hill (Harold Perrineau,Lost),Ozisn't an easy show to watch. Inmates are routinely raped, tortured, and killed--not out of need, but out of boredom and cruelty. And in a corrupt system where too few bureaucrats actually care about these men's lives, few are willing to do anything about it. Those that do give a damn--Sister Peter Marie (Rita Moreno,West Side Story), Father Mukada (B.D. Wong,Law & Order: Special Victims Unit), Dr. Nathan (Lauren Velez), Warden Glynn (Ernie Hudson), McManus (Terry Kinney)--face an uphill battle.One of the strongest storylines is the ongoing romance between murderer Keller (Christopher Meloni,Law & Order: SVUand Beecher (Lee Tergesen), who's hoping to be paroled. Series creator Tom Fontana doesn't allow their arc to be diluted by any idealistic expectations. The viewer is acutely aware that Beecher is an easy target for annihilation whether or not he is released from prison. The viewer is never quite as certain of Keller's motives--whether they're borne of love and affection, or a selfish need to satisfy his own primal urges. Like Beecher, Alvarez (Kirk Acevedo) is trying to keep his own nose clean in the hopes that he'll be eligible for parole three years down the line. It's easy to understand the almost suffocating feeling he lives every day, knowing that three years may as well be a lifetime when you're behind bars and the target of both your former gang and the Aryan brothers, led by Schillinger (J.K. Simmons,Law & Order: SVU, theSpider-Manfilms). And Ryan (Dean Winters) desperately tries to save his mentally retarded brother Cyril (played by Dean's real-life sibling Scott William Winters) from being executed.There are a few subplots that don't ring true, such as the quasi romance between a librarian (Patti LuPone) and one of the prisoners, and an elderly inmate's (Joey Grey) implausible death wish. And for all the constraints the majority of convicts face, some appear to have almost free run of the prison. Still, Fontana has created a vivid, dark world where the occasional acts of humanity are as important as the non-stop chaos that is Oz. While it certainly helps to have seen the previous five seasons of the series to enjoy this season, it's not mandatory. These last eight episodes work fine as a stand-alone piece of drama.--Jae-Ha Kim", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0009GV9E6", "B00031TYBC", "B0000Y40PW", "B00000FBH2", "B00005Y6YJ", "0060521333", "B00A2JP6V2", "B000QXDJLI", "B00123BY6S", "B00316DDYA", "B0007R4SWM", "B004YOEDR4", "B00G4EWNCO", "B000FTCLSU", "B0001KL5DA", "B0006IUD9Y", "B0002ERXC2", "B00G4EWJ1O", "B0015TX2LO", "B005NFJAWG", "B000067S1G", "B000UX6TK2", "B005SEDI5M", "B00EEDNR9A", "B00HW3EXCE", "B0013FSL16", "0783230338", "B002FLOTPE", "B0007YMVWO", "B0020TS5EM", "B00B52F278", "B001PQZYQI", "B00DJYJRHG", "B0060MYKYY", "B0009NZ2W4", "B004BZ5AHI", "B00EIL7E9C", "B0001O3YLM", "B003PIUBZS", "B003CN5SAY", "B0015I2S7E", "B007TBIUSM", "B002AMVEDI", "B0012CJQZ0", "B00FYL08RK", "B00008PW1F", "B002AMVED8", "B00ADQPB50", "B008PJZDXW", "B00C8CQRQ4", "B00003CXOP", "B0002I84JO", "B000EHSVMS", "B00005NOHO", "B001AQBGM4", "B004YM6JSW", "B00F9F1K8W", "B00DXP7L88", "B002XUL6RG", "B0024FAD9C", "B0009IW88K", "B002N57KGM", "B003XWEQ8E", "B000V86OKG", "B000Q6GUW0", "B00166UFSY", "B000002MUG", "B0036TGTF2", "B0012CJQYQ", "B000FFJYE8", "B0024FAD92", "B0055SNHQG", "B00005JNOG", "B00GST8PHW", "B0092Q82LC", "B003UD7J6W", "B0032JTV6A", "B0058YPG1G", "B0015ABRE2", "B00FEP9MYG", "B003L77GRO", "B000NVT0UM", "B00HI4EGQA", "B0024FAR4I", "B00HQVB0Q4", "B0089J2926", "B006CR2OOA", "B00124ONGA", "B007HOQ5FQ", "B00915G6WQ", "B003L77GTC", "B009TE9GNK", "B00JF5G8WU", "B00021R7E4", "B000FS9MY2", "B00HUCF6KK", "B001KKU9D2", "B0012CJQY6", "B0042L0OFY"], "bought_together": ["B0009GV9E6", "B00031TYBC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0000Y40PW", "B00000FBH2", "B00005Y6YJ", "B0009GV9E6"]}, "price": 22.96, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 44664}, "asin": "B000G1R4TS", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51-AjbLxssL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Oz: Season 6"}

{"description": "This Jack Black vehicle seems, on the surface, like a perfect fit for the actor: an opportunity to showcase Black's unique style with the extreme facial gestures and exuberant physicality that have become his forte. Black plays Ignacio, a lowly cook in a monastery in central Mexico who feeds orphans by day, and wrestles in the town square at night. Ignacio teams up with Esqueleto (Hector Jimenez), a street urchin who tormented him, to form a tag-team duo that goes up against the strangest wrestlers Mexico has to offer. Besides doing it for money to feed the orphans, Ignacio is also fighting to win the forbidden affections of Sister Encarnacion (Ana de la Reguera) with predictable difficulty. While the movie has likeable characters and the plot is enjoyable enough, it can&#x92;t overcome its plodding pace and formulaic structure enough to keep the movie interesting throughout. Jack Black is a very strong comedic actor, and the wrestling scenes offer plenty of chances for slapstick, physical comedy, but watching him run around in red briefs and blue tights amounts to half the laughs in the movie, and there&#x92;s just not enough here for him to really work with. When he plays a more well-formed character, as inSchool of RockandHigh Fidelity, his strengths really show. But inNacho Librehe&#x92;s saddled with a caricature. Weighed down by too much low-brow humor and a script that goes nowhere,Nacho Librejust can&#x92;t make full enough use of Black&#x92;s talents to overcome the obstacles.--Daniel Vancini", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00H47IXTC", "B003498RCW", "B00AEFYP3E", "B00AEBB87O", "B00AEFY7YQ", "B001IKKMCW", "B001GPOSYC", "B00AEFYYA8", "B00BG4R476", "B00AEBB9C8", "B004IK30S2", "B000WQWPJQ", "B004SJ0EBE", "B005ERX1UU", "B0018O4YSQ", "B005DZ35TU", "B00AEFXXFU", "B00CXYCBNA", "B00AEFYRVO", "B002KLAL8S", "B00193F304", "B00E9E4F68", "B0062VL4XS", "B00AEFXIQE", "B00E3QJ7FG", "B00CXY9WIM", "B00H7KJTCG", "B004ZJZQ1A", "B00DYEN6XC", "B00HWWUQYY", "B007Q1GJA6", "B000MEYFXW", "B00AEBBAEA", "B00AEFXJNQ", "B001G5T6GC", "B00JL6L4WC", "B00H83EV5W", "B00COHGPQA", "B008V5UQZK", "B003IWZ750", "B008JFUR10", "B008MIMWOO", "B00AEBBAF4", "B004TJ1H0A", "B004047XWU", "B006WZIETG", "B005KQVDH8", "B002ZG97WO", "B0014DFCMS", "B00267QOEQ", "B0021L9ME6", "B001O7JHW0", "B001IKKMD6", "B00AEFXDGE", "B0090SI582", "B004RQDPBE", "B0014BQQZM", "B001KZVQJI", "B0082JRF7C", "B001KEHAHQ", "B000J4P9PI", "B0029XFN8A", "B00CTSDDVO", "B001CW7ZUS", "B00COHGORU", "B00HERGM86", "B0093LE2OC", "B0047685I2", "B00BLN4UDI", "B004RQDYXI", "B00DHHWY9I"], "bought_together": ["B00H47IXTC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001JNNDE2", "B0082JRF7C", "B0054OGQOQ", "B005ERX1UU"]}, "price": 19.95, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 149245}, "asin": "B000HDZK1Y", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51sDOKT8e4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Nacho Libre [Blu-ray]"}

{"description": "After Akira Kurosawa'sYojimbowas released in 1961, the samurai film would never be the same. It's difficult for latter-day Western audiences to fully appreciate just how revolutionary Kurosawa's film was in its time; it had the same kind of popular impact that Quentin Tarantino'sPulp Fictionhad 33 years later, which is to say, it completely revolutionized its genre, and its influence continues to this day. With an emphasis on dark, delicious comedy, Kurosawa deliberately set out to overturn the conventions ofchambara--or swordplay film--and he began by casting the great Toshiro Mifune in the role that would define his career. Unlike the samurai of previous films (including Kurosawa's own masterpiece,Seven Samurai), Sanjuro was an unkempt, down-and-out drifter, a masterlessroninand with time on his hands and nowhere to go. When he chances upon a corrupt, terror-stricken village where clashing merchants are engaged in a ruthless range war, Sanjuro amuses himself by playing both ends against the middle, offering his services asyojimbo(bodyguard) to both sides, then standing back to watch all hell break loose. It's a perfect game of wily deception, hugely popular with Japanese moviegoers as Mifune's performance gained iconic status.Yojimbo's international success was no less impressive; it eventually inspired two noteworthy remakes (Sergio Leone's spaghetti WesternA Fistful of Dollarsin 1964, and Walter Hill's mobster interpretation,Last Man Standing, in 1996), and remains one of Kurosawa's most popular classics.A sequel was inevitable, and Kurosawa responded to public demand as only a true artist would, with the equally impressiveSanjuro, quite different fromYojimbowhile allowing Mifune to reprise his signature role with a lighter comedic touch. This time, Sanjuro is recruited by a group of young, idealistic samurai to eliminate corruption in their clan, and in the process he completely subverts their overly reverent notions of \"proper\" samurai behavior. And while bothYojimboandSanjurowere milestones in movie violence (featuring the spurting geysers of arterial blood that would become a staple ofchambarafrom this point forward), the calmer, more comically subduedSanjuroactually boasts a higher body count, and both films rank among the finest examples of Kurosawa's peerless mastery of action.The Criterion Collection's double-disc set is a must-have for any serious cinephile. Both films (also available separately) are presented with all-new, fully restored high-definition digital transfers, representing (as in the case ofSeven Samurai) a significant improvement over Criterion's previous DVD releases. Both films feature full-length commentaries by Kurosawa scholar Stephen Prince (with eloquent emphasis on camera movement and composition) in addition to retrospective documentaries culled from the priceless JapaneseToho MasterworksseriesAkira Kurosawa: It Is Wonderful to Create, featuring illuminating interviews with many of Kurosawa's closest collaborators. Theatrical trailers and behind-the-scenes photo galleries are also included, along with new-and-improved subtitles, insightful booklet essays by critics Michael Sragow and Alexander Sesonske, and rarely seen production notes by Kurosawa and members of his casts & crew. With this two-disc reissue, Criterion's previous releases ofYojimboandSanjuroshould now be considered officially obsolete.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000G8NXYG", "B007N5YK10", "B001BEK8E2", "B00005B1ZL", "B002E01MBA", "B00005JLEJ", "B0009WIE2A", "B000AQKUD6", "B00687XNNK", "B00K5EJHGO", "B000067IY6", "B00005JLMU", "B0007989YS", "B004XQO8MS", "B00180R072", "B006H3KQSK", "B0001UZZSG", "B000VARC3C", "B005JJCMN0", "B00HE01030", "B000BB14I0", "B000NOK0H6", "B000056NWP", "B000BR6QCI", "B000C6NP7M", "B001WLMOL4", "B00065GX0K", "B00065GX64", "B00004W3HF", "6305028699", "B003N2CVQ8", "B00019JR5Y", "0780021061", "B002ZG4Q5W", "B00004Y7HL", "B004NWPY20", "B001PCNZJU", "6305081034", "B005D0RDPM", "B000MM0LEG", "B003KGBISY", "B00005JLV7", "B0009IW8CQ", "B00CEIOHPU", "B0000A02TW", "B000PKG6O4", "B0026VBOJM", "B00393SG0G", "B00CUKTGSA", "B005VU9LO0", "B00BX49BGQ", "B000AQKUFO", "B001O549G6", "B00B2BYXSQ", "B004WPYO3I", "B000FDECGA", "B000WEH74G", "B0056ANHCC", "B00GBT62N8", "B00006JMQH", "B002AFX52S", "B000G8NY1I", "B00A8QDI3M", "B004WPYO7E", "B000E5LEV0", "0780021045", "0780022343", "B001LMU1C8", "B00006JMQG", "B000XPSC0C", "0780023080", "B000FS9FIK", "B0001UZZS6", "B00B2BYXYA", "B005152C9G", "B00284G2BC", "B00DZP1BUU", "B0001UZZSQ", "B0001GH5RY", "B00180R06I", "B00782O7UM", "B0000A2ZNX", "B002VRNJDA", "B00AEFYSEA", "B000ASATM6", "B000OPPAF6", "B000VUQ4HW", "B0030A6ICG", "B008MPQ112", "B002U6DVPS", "B008VF0Y02", "B000AQKUC2", "B003ZYU3U0", "B001MEJY9G", "B00005NC66", "B001TIQT7A", "B0040QYROA", "B006C1S1DY", "B004KDYR7A", "B001EKP5DC"], "bought_together": ["B000G8NXYG", "B007N5YK10"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000G8NXYG", "B000K0YLZ0", "B00HE01030", "B001BEK8E2"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 58605}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 42.99, "brand": "Image Entertainment", "asin": "B000K0YM0Y", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51IEw14HqBL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Yojimbo &amp; Sanjuro: Two Films By Akira Kurosawa (The Criterion Collection)"}

Filled with spectacular rescues in the lethal waters of the Bering Sea, THE GUARDIAN is a riveting and compelling story that dives straight into the heart and soul of real heroes, the unsung guardians of the sea.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0006L0L5C", "B000F6IODE", "B000TAN904", "B003AWRM9M", "B000N3SRO0", "0767817729", "B002U4UYYQ", "B000P0J0C4", "6301971345", "B00B83ROIE", "B001ILFUBE", "0792844874", "B000J3OTT6", "1558908315", "B00005JKZH", "078324021X", "B0006N2EZ0", "B0038RSJB4", "B002NZK5TQ", "B00000G3PA", "B00AEBB9NM", "B00003CXTG", "B00005JNP4", "0783223609", "B0000TANUI", "B0068FZ0O2", "B0013FDM7E", "B000LXGXX4", "B00AEBB86A", "B002ZG984Q", "B000065U1N", "B002VWNID6", "0783233507", "B00AEBBA36", "B002GHHHHO", "B00005B6JZ", "B000056VP4", "B004EPYZP8", "B0081FSMPG", "B00005JPBO", "B0000B1OFL", "B001U1RM40", "B00AEFY0XE", "B0002WZTOI", "B000EXZFCQ", "B0068FZ0GK", "B00AEFYQE2", "B005LAIGRS", "B0013J55B6", "B001LMAK88", "B00005JA9F", "B00007E2F5", "B004AOECXI", "B0009UZGIM", "B00004Z4WR", "B0010YSD8Q", "6304711891", "B00866JL96", "B003ASLJOU", "B002AT8KD8", "B002K0WBXW", "B000YCPUWW", "B0012KJ0DK", "B00003CXS7", "B003NHRIVQ", "B002GIBVVG", "B00001ZWUS", "B000YAF4MA", "B00005J760", "B00DZP1C2W", "B001QYOSEI", "B000ENC5YW", "B002O3Z50G", "B000P0J0EW", "B00275EGWY", "B00008WJD6", "B00JA3RVG4", "B000J3OTSM", "B004P7CMVE", "B00005JOC9", "B003ASLJO0", "B00081U7HC", "6305213283", "B00004BZIY", "B001680M26", "B003L20IG0", "B004SEUJOQ", "B00006JDVV", "B000VR0570", "B004FQX59I", "B002AT8K9W", "B007FQXEXW", "B005LAIGYQ", "B00AIBZMD6", "B00000IBL0", "B0002KVUKM", "B00003CXGV", "B004VW4V80", "B0038N9WKU", "B000P0J0EM"], "bought_together": ["B0006L0L5C"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0767817729", "B00JA3RVG4", "B000J3OTT6", "0790749912"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 5786}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.88, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B000KF0GWW", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51%2BBVQzrEJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Guardian"}
{"description": "A comedy with serious intentions,Man of the Yearattempts to challenge the audience's notions of what is and isn't real when it comes to politics. Tom Dobbs (Robin Williams) is a popular political talk show host. As a lark, he runs for president and wins. The thing is, he's not any more unqualified than the other candidates, so his victory doesn't seem quite so outrageous.  But when it turns out that the computer ballot firm responsible for tallying all the votes may have had a glitch--and that a recount would negate his win--mayhem ensues and the film segues from comedy, to drama, and back to comedy (sort of) again. Directed by Barry Levinson (Diner,Wag the Dog), the film doesn't take advantage of Williams' natural humor or charm. He at times appears to be chomping at the bit to unleash a comedic tirade or two, only to be held back by stiff lines. Williams only truly appears to be enjoying himself when trading lines with Laura Linney, who portrays the hapless do-gooder at the ballot firm who's being set up to appear unreliable. With some fine performances by a supporting cast that includes Jeff Goldblum, Lewis Black, and the inimitable Christopher Walken,Man of the Yearoccasionally hints at greatness. But at best, it's a lukewarm comedy with a diluted message.--Jae-Ha Kim", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00079HZOS", "B001ILFUBE", "B0036VHJ5Y", "B002PI1NRO", "0780622561", "B00000IQV7", "B00005JPQE", "B004GJYRKK", "6305297142", "0790731460", "B00007976U", "630587493X", "B0043X1FL8", "6305428441", "B001ECDVJU", "B004SIP7ZS", "B000FDEVA2", "0783227973", "B000B8QG22", "B003LR5BD0", "B00008L3U1", "B000MXPE7O", "B00005JKBC", "B00133KFGW", "B001TH92N4", "B004SUDQB8", "B000077VQ6", "B002AS464Q", "B000CEV3M8", "B000N4RAR4", "B002NZK5UU", "B00005V9HT", "B000QQLVPQ", "B00AEBB9SM", "B005XB8SHI", "B00006ADFN", "6305144168", "B00AEFY74G", "B00008979G", "B000W1V5VU", "B000059TG6", "B008XAT0VO", "B0013XZ2QK", "B003ASLJQI", "B000FKP3XY", "B0001FGBUW", "B000CEXEWA", "B00020HAXI", "B00007GZR5", "B000BYA4IS", "0783227396", "B000RJO56E", "B000RETOGU", "B0000633R5", "B00275EGWY", "B000031EGV", "B00005JLSB", "B00015YVDG", "B000FVQLLQ", "B00AEBB9WI", "B00008MTVY", "B000P0J0BK", "B000067J1Y", "B000ARFPNK", "B000BITVA6", "B00097DY0M", "B001GCUO02", "B000N3SRO0", "B00005JM20", "B00BEIYKX0", "B001AZIRYA", "B001BL96JI", "B007L6VRHG", "B00008DDXA", "B002NZK5QO", "B000XJD33O", "B00005JND5", "B00004XPPB", "B000SFOW8I", "B0043X1FM2", "076780676X", "B001ECDVK4", "B001QE99AQ", "B000TZX5XK", "B001NFNFNU", "6305213283", "B000YAF4MA", "B00803PFXG", "B001TUZD8O", "B000M9CB4W", "B00005V4XW", "B00005JKIS", "B000H0MKOC", "B003Q6D2B4", "B000RETOH4", "B002ZG998G", "B004SUDQ2W", "B0002I837M", "B003AWRM9W", "B00096S4DK"], "bought_together": ["B00000IQV7"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0043X1FL8", "B0036VHJ5Y", "B0034GK78W", "0780622561"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 103853}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.97, "brand": "Universal Studios", "asin": "B000LC5B7O", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Y5NvZAJqL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Man of the Year (Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "Academy Award&reg;-winner Kathy Bates (Lead Actress,Misery, 1990) and Academy Award&reg;-nominee Alfre Woodard (Supporting Actress,Cross Creek, 1983) star as the matriarchs of two very different families being torn apart by greed and scandal in the contemporary dramaTyler Perry's The Family That Preys.  The sixth feature film by Perry chronicles the inner workings of two families&mdash;one upper-crust and the other working class&mdash;that become inextricably linked by scandal.    Wealthy socialite Charlotte Cartwright (Kathy Bates) and her dear friend Alice Pratt (Alfre Woodard), a working class woman of high ideals, have enjoyed a lasting friendship throughout many years.  Suddenly, their lives become mired in turmoil as their adult children&rsquo;s extramarital affairs, unethical business practices and a dark paternity secret threaten to derail family fortunes and unravel the lives of all involved. Alice&rsquo;s self-centered newlywed daughter Andrea (Sanaa Lathan) is betraying her trusting husband Chris (Rockmond Dunbar) by engaging in a torrid affair with her boss and mother&rsquo;s best friend&rsquo;s son William (Cole Hauser).  While cheating on his wife Jillian (KaDee Strickland) with a string of ongoing dalliances with his mistress Andrea, William&rsquo;s true focus is to replace the COO of his mother&rsquo;s lucrative construction corporation.  Meanwhile, Alice&rsquo;s other daughter Pam (Taraji P. Henson), a kind but no nonsense woman married to a hard working construction worker (Tyler Perry), tries to steer the family in a more positive direction.    While paternity secrets, marital infidelity, greed and unsavory business dealings threaten to derail both families, Charlotte and Alice decide to take a breather from it all by making a cross-country road trip in which they rediscover themselves and possibly find a way to save their families from ruin inTyler Perry's The Family That Preys.BeyondTyler Perry's The Family That Preyson DVDTyler Perry's Meet the Brownson DVDTyler Perry's Why Did I Get Marriedon DVDTyler Perry's Daddy's Little Girlson DVD", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001132GNY", "B000PE0GRI", "B0018RNF60", "B003Y5H56K", "B002ZG99RW", "B005LAIH1S", "B00097DXFS", "B002VKB0LU", "B000F9SO0O", "B0026JI1R2", "B008SOS7W8", "B003Y5H4ZC", "B00BEL4QFO", "B001QUF7DS", "B003Y5H58S", "B0055OTDCM", "B008FCX2D2", "B0009A40NE", "B00AZMFJ90", "B0009A40NY", "B003UEYBPI", "B000YAF4Q6", "B002VECM4A", "B001JV5BC6", "B0088RMEII", "B003L16FCC", "B00066FAQW", "B005LAIH86", "B00AJLHVES", "B008SOSB0G", "B001DJLCQS", "B000BQ7J8Y", "0783240201", "B000FA57JE", "B0009A40NO", "B00HW3EI3I", "B005KR6NNG", "B000XT1P52", "B0009A40O8", "B00CWBPQ22", "B0010YVCAW", "B000FA57IU", "B00JPFTW1E", "B00BTYPWDQ", "B0041H55SK", "B0041H55S0", "B00004Y2R1", "B007P9HVJC", "B00GOZ2LPM", "B0041H55RQ", "B002CA68NO", "B00BNV9WCW", "B002CAWNEM", "B00H47IX5G", "6305505780", "B00007L4KF", "B006IVNIS6", "B000A6T2KS", "B000F3UA5M", "B00066FAVW", "B0018RNF74", "B00AEFYHVO", "B00EJU9GQ6", "B000HDZKLO", "B00005JLG1", "B00AMEZDJW", "B008SOSCHS", "B005OK721G", "B001KKU9DM", "B00BYS0RQE", "B00000JGHV", "B00AEFXTKO", "B005DCJ3LM", "6305428409", "B0053YT3II", "B00066FAC6", "B00005ASOO", "B00003CY51", "B00AEFXY6I", "B000FUH35U", "B007SS7MAS", "B000VZADPG", "B002NZK5VO", "B00AEFYQWO", "B0034G4P1C", "B0018W2L1A", "B003VEL8ZS", "B000P0J092", "B000JLTRH2", "B0072GOJ98", "B007Q2GR9I", "B000BITV9W", "B00005ALM8", "1558908390", "B005KR6NQS", "B00005LB86", "B00005JPK8", "B00465I1CE", "B000XSWVEC", "B00005JNRM"], "bought_together": ["B001132GNY", "B003Y5H56K"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003Y5H56K", "B000F9SO0O", "B00097DXFS", "B0018RNF60"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 5943}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.89, "brand": "Lionsgate", "asin": "B000LW7REE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51TziuSehYL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Family That Preys (Full Screen Edition)"}
{"description": "Flushed Awayis a rip-roaring nautical adventure with a twist: The heroes are a pair of rodents braving the sewers underneath London. Roddy (voiced by Hugh Jackman) is an upper-crust house-mouse who finds himself flushed into the subterranean sewers. Eager to return to his posh home, he enlists the help of a boat-captain rat named Rita (Kate Winslet), who has troubles of her own; namely the kingpin of the underworld, the Toad (Ian McKellen), and his henchmen including the French mercenary Le Frog (Jean Reno).While technicallyFlushed Awaycould be considered part of the wave of celebrity-voiced, anthropomorphic-animal movies that hit in 2005-2006 (Madagascar,Over the Hedge,The Wild, etc.), it doesn't inspire the same sense of d&#xE9;j&#xE0; vu. For one thing, its voice actors are less recognizable than the likes of Bruce Willis and Chris Rock. For another, its look is very distinctive. Like Nick Park'sChicken RunandWallace and Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit, it's a joint production of DreamWorks Animation and Aardman Features, and although Park isn't involved, it retains his trademark blocky look of clay animation. But animating the movie by computer rather than by hand allows for some eye-popping tableaux, such as floodwaters rushing through the sewers and an entire town of little animated characters. It's a crazy thrill ride loaded with inside jokes and enough crude humor to earn a PG rating, and the band of singing slugs is also a hoot.--David HoriuchiOn the DVDIt's no surprise that the singing slugs are the stars of the DVD's bonus features. They're featured in two music videos (less than a minute total), and in a 13-minute segment an Aardman animator builds a slug out of plasticine.  (In contrast, the lesson on drawing Roddy is a mere two minutes.) A song jukebox jumps to 10 musical points in the film, though the non-slug background music isn't really worth the jump. On the human side, there are eight-minute featurettes on the music and the voices, a set-top game that is easier to control than most such featurettes (and easier to beat too), and a commentary track by directors David Bowers and Sam Fell in which they have a grand old time remembering their inside jokes and showering love on the Spike and Whitey characters. The DVD-ROM has access to 21 more online games.--David HoriuchiFun Facts fromFlushed AwayIn Tabitha's room, there are a variety of dolls from previous DreamWorks Animation films, including a Gromit and several bunnies fromWallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,an Alex the Lion fromMadagascar,and a Dragon fromShrek.Many characters from past films make cameos inFlushed Away.For example, aChicken Runchicken is on the second page of the Toad&#x92;s scrapbook, Gromit&#x92;s head is a pencil top in the Jammy Dodger, the penguin fromWallace and Gromit: The Wrong Trousersis on a stamp on the Jammy Dodger, and a poster ofWallace and Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbitis on the side of a bus in Kensington.There are officially 60 million rats in the UK.  That&#x92;s one rat for every person.The various boats in the film are made up of flotsam and jetsam that rats could conceivably find in the sewer.For the double decker bus:Ice chest, retro flipping numbers alarm clock, bike lamp, buckle, oil drum, soup can, license plate, rope, plastic suitcase, jerry can.For the mini cooper: Soda can, battery,  sardine can, butter knife, old lights.Simulating the toilet water and making it look realistic proved to be a challenge.  After much consideration, it was finally discovered that what was missing was caustics, or the use of light reflection off the bottom of the bowl.  This was added and everyone was happy because they could finally get their mind out of the toilet.Stills fromFlushed Away(click for larger image)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0012EM5D8", "B0006JMLRK", "B00003CXJ4", "B00005JNQS", "B002WJI2QQ", "B001DPHDCY", "B001U3D88M", "B0000640SC", "B000H7JCK0", "B00CWM58WY", "B004HO6I4M", "B005SDUV4E", "0783231474", "B001PR0YEE", "B004EPZ034", "B001GCUO7A", "B000RMJ4F8", "B0006UEVT0", "B001LPWGFA", "B000CZ0PT4", "B00029LO0Y", "B000BITUVG", "B000MV9026", "B000ION23A", "B000L22SG6", "B000UVKGPI", "B004AKCME8", "B000DWMYQ8", "B000065V42", "B000MNOX9E", "B000EQ5UHS", "6305161887", "B003UESJF6", "B001ECQ75A", "B000UFIYOO", "B005LAIISA", "B00B7EQPNE", "B00CHVJODE", "B001FTIJS0", "B0000AOX0O", "B002ZG97YM", "B007FF3HQM", "B00003CXG7", "B00E00OGE2", "B004SIPAFK", "B001LXIDTA", "B006JD48LO", "B00E9ZATJO", "B005LAIIT4", "B009AMAH3O", "B00000JL8E", "B00000JGOQ", "B0000VV4W2", "B003E66Y84", "B00EBBGLFC", "B004LWZW7Y", "B001OMU6UM", "B00005JM7T", "B002UOMH00", "B008JFUQ16", "0783219806", "B000IFRT2O", "B005QODEEE", "B001HN6918", "B00007LVCM", "B000GUJZ00", "B00HLTD2OE", "B00005JMFH", "B001NCDFTW", "B001GCUNWQ", "B000G75AZC", "B00JK531ES", "B005LAIIHG", "B0046A9RMM", "B000AY74OG", "B008R65XPQ", "B001NLJ3RG", "B00009YXAW", "B00GRZPQCO", "B001RXDM36", "B0034G4P26", "B004OWQTZ0", "B0052XI5J8", "B0034G4OYA", "B0044RFTCO", "B006VUYJ00", "B001LXIDTK", "B008NNY9QW", "B00LG6YEKE", "B00028HBES", "B000P0J09W", "B000VBJEEG", "B00I6JOD2S", "B0039N74CW", "B00ALMNCLQ", "B001SXZ7T2", "B00CWM5MDY", "B000ROAK2W", "B00AEBB8KQ"], "bought_together": ["B004HO6I4M", "B00CWM58WY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002WJI2QQ", "B004HO6I4M", "B00CWM58WY", "B00003CXJ4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 5311}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.85, "brand": "Dreamworks", "asin": "B000M343BC", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51PGB5ZeCfL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Flushed Away (Widescreen Edition)"}
