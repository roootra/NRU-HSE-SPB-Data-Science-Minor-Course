{"description": "The model animation techniques in this 1968 Rankin and Bass TV chestnut  are primitive by today's standards, and picky kids may reject them out of hand. The story, however, which elaborates on the popular Christmas song about a shepherd boy who plays his drum for the baby Jesus and makes the animals dance, is a little more tough-minded than you might expect. The kid begins the story as what we'd now call a neglected child, a surly urchin who says he hates all people. He's pulled back from the brink, first by learning to make music, and then by his encounter with the Christ child. The underlying message alone--that everybody has something worth contributing--qualifies the show for holiday-perennial status. The big-name voice performers, Jose Ferrer and Greer Garson (who narrates), may be a little too ponderous for the occasion, but the familiar cartoony tones of Paul Frees (aka Boris Badenov) and June Forey (aka Rocket J. Squirrel) help liven up the proceedings. It's only 23 minutes long, so it's worth a shot for younger children.--David Chute", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0009YWTHY", "0307142469", "0307142450", "0307142701", "6302642248", "6302503795", "0788812408", "6301392884", "6302503760", "B00008X5J8", "0307142477", "6302765536", "6302426200", "6304400225", "6302091632"], "bought_together": ["0307142450"], "also_viewed": ["B000CR08EY", "B0009YWTHY", "0307142450", "0307142477", "0307142469", "0307142701", "0307142671", "B0002I82Z0", "B0057FGCJQ", "0307141071", "6302292018", "0307142094"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 386707}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.25, "brand": "", "asin": "0307142485", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51SJ9K7WMAL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Little Drummer Boy [VHS]"}

{"description": "Lone Japanese soldier Toshiro Mifune diligently scans the ocean from his island lookout as he must have thousands of times before, but this time he spies an abandoned life raft resting on a rocky bluff. Within minutes he's face to face with American sea-wreck survivor Lee Marvin and the two begin an elaborate game of cat and mouse. Director John Boorman presents this two-man war as a deadly game between a pair of overgrown children, who finally tire of it (as kids will) and settle into tolerated co-existence and then even something resembling a friendship. With impressionistic strokes, Boorman paints a lush tropical paradise in colors you can drink from the screen, capturing the texture of their experience as refracted through the cinema: the look of the island as seen through the haze of smoke, the sound of a sudden rainstorm as it hushes the island in a calming roar, the timelessness of life outside of civilization. The story seems almost secondary, an allegorical drama that comes alive in the excellent performances by Marvin and Mifune (who soon enough converse despite their complete inability to understand each other's language) and the visceral immediacy of Boorman's gorgeous widescreen images.Hell in the Pacificis not a tale told as much as a film experienced.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0007U84D8", "6300247376", "079284517X"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 615949}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.4, "brand": "", "asin": "076400459X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5112B61QYML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Hell in the Pacific/Collector's Edition [VHS]"}
{"description": "There's no getting around a simple, basic truth: watchingLawrence of Arabiain any home-video format represents a compromise. There's no better way to appreciate this epic biographical adventure than to see it projected in 70 millimeter onto a huge theater screen. That caveat aside, David Lean's masterful \"desert classic\" is still enjoyable on the small screen, especially if viewed in widescreen format. (If your only option is to view a \"pan & scan\" version, it's best not to bother; this is a film for which the widescreen format is utterly mandatory.) Peter O'Toole gives a star-making performance as T.E. Lawrence, the eccentric British officer who united the desert tribes of Arabia against the Turks during World War I. Lean orchestrates sweeping battle sequences and breathtaking action, but the film is really about the adventures and trials that transform Lawrence into a legendary man of the desert. Lean traces this transformation on a vast canvas of awesome physicality; no other movie has captured the expanse of the desert with such scope and grandeur. Equally important is the psychology of Lawrence, who remains an enigma even as we grasp his identification with the desert. Perhaps the greatest triumph of this landmark film is that Lean has conveyed the romance, danger, and allure of the desert with such physical and emotional power. It's a film about a man who leads one life but is irresistibly drawn to another, where his greatness and mystery are allowed to flourish in equal measure.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000040EJ", "6305123616", "0800132009", "6304151306", "6304071876", "6303168507", "0792839846", "630150528X", "6304196954", "630018224X", "B0000048ZL", "B000005PFL", "6300215539", "0792844645", "6302464889", "0780616456", "6300216721", "6300246965", "0783235593", "0792837630", "6301628454", "6302909023", "B000059HGY", "6302415853", "6301976622", "6305282927", "0790743213", "6303020089", "6300214060", "0783216084", "6305261296", "B00003CXE6", "6301662954", "B000003KHS", "0800179552", "B000056BRF", "079213690X", "630105573X", "B00000F6D1", "6300215814", "6300185095", "B00005Q4GY", "0792133153", "6301971809", "6301628667", "6303494390", "B00004TIUO", "6300214567", "6300214826", "6300181340", "6303402348", "B000EO7AIC", "B00005A1VH", "0783235607", "0790732017", "6303057225", "0800199421", "0790733927", "6304935811", "6301016289", "6303383300", "0790752395", "6302610702", "0783221347", "0790701251", "0783231482", "630018627X", "0790734079", "B000003KDG", "B00005OCPO", "0792836553", "B000062XM6", "0800125762", "0792108280", "6302800420", "B00005QATY", "6300181286", "5559477621", "6301208773", "6301888901", "B00005A7VC", "B00005LMA7", "1558807780", "B00007JME0", "B00000I1EM", "6304111398", "6300183513", "6303402070", "0792116887", "6303203337", "0790744589", "6300251012", "6302256615", "0792110463", "6300183084", "B000006GCU", "B00004RFFA", "630347327X", "6302023742", "079283853X"], "bought_together": ["B0000040EJ", "6305123616"], "also_viewed": ["6305123616", "B000054OW2", "6305363668", "B00BBND56G", "0782008348", "0792836510", "6304117752", "0783216084", "6303402070", "0792839846", "6302610702", "6304539258", "1558807780", "0792158261", "B0000040EJ", "6302909023"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 425814}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.89, "brand": "VHS", "asin": "0767812778", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51CAQY4V9AL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Lawrence of Arabia (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]"}

{"description": "Wild Thingsis the kind of lurid, trashy thriller that you'll either dive into with unabashed pleasure or turn away from in prudish disgust; it's entirely your choice, but we suggest the former option since it's obviously much more fun.

Another student (Neve Campbell) raises a similar charge against the teacher, and that's when a police officer (Kevin Bacon) begins to investigate the allegations.

{"description": "One of the best romantic comedies of the 1990s,My Best Friend's Weddingnot only gave Julia Roberts a delightful vehicle for her crowd-pleasing comeback, but it further distinguished itself by avoiding the conventional plotting of the genre. Julia plays a prominent Chicago restaurant critic whose best friend (Dermot Mulroney) is a former lover from her college days with whom she'd made a binding pact: if neither of them were married by the age of 28, they'd marry each other. Just when they're about to reach the deadline of their agreement, Mulroney arrives in Chicago to introduce Roberts to his seemingly perfect fianc&eacute;e (Cameron Diaz) and announce their wedding in just three days. That leaves the shocked Julia with just three short days to sabotage the wedding and marry the man she now realizes she's loved all along. With potential heartbreak waiting in the wings, she'll either get what she wants or pay the price for her selfish behavior, and Ronald Bass's cleverly constructed screenplay keeps us guessing to the very end. Rupert Everett scored rave reviews for his scene-stealing performance as Robert's gay friend who goes along with her scheming (but only so far), and even as she makes her character's needy desperation disarmingly appealing, Roberts wisely allows Diaz to capitalize on her charming time in the spotlight. As the romantic outcome remains uncertain, the viewer is held in a state of giddy suspense, and director P.J. Hogan pulls off some hilarious scenes (like a restaurant full of people singing the Dionne Warwick hit \"I Say a Little Prayer\") that could easily have fallen flat in the hands of a less talented filmmaker.

{"description": "Based on a story by Clive Barker and skillfully written and directed by Bernard Rose,Candymanrises above most horror films by eerily suggesting that some urban legends--in this case a particularly frightening one--have a spooky basis in reality. The legend of the Candyman is a potent one around the high-rise tenements of Chicago's Cabrini-Green housing complex, where the residents speak of a dark, ominous figure who appears when his victims say his name five times in front of a mirror, then mercilessly slashes them to death. Upon learning that the Candyman is rumored to live in one of the vacant tenements, a University of Illinois researcher (Virginia Madsen) investigates a recent murder at Cabrini-Green. She learns that the Candyman (played by Tony Todd) is both unreal and chillingly real--a supernatural force of evil empowered by those who believe in his legend. He is a killer made flesh by the belief of others, and the young researcher's investigation is a threat to his existence. What happens next? We wouldn't dare spoil the chills, but rest assured that writer-director Rose has tapped into a wellspring of urban angst and fear, andCandymanserves up its gruesome frights with a refreshing dose of intelligence.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005K3NZ", "6305622760", "B001B8XRT6", "B000MNOX8U", "B008874968", "B000A6T1ZY", "B004AC6PMG", "B001B1UO6W", "B00005NRN6", "B000GBEWRU", "B000V4UFZK", "B0000AOX0D", "B000I2J68M", "6305972001", "B001B1872A", "B0000AOX0E", "B00006FDCD", "B000FS9FE4", "B001DJLD1W", "B005CFBZQ6", "B000099T3M", "B000RIWAVW", "B005OT810I", "B000MV8ABS", "B000EHRVP6", "B00006IUFV", "B0000AOX0A", "B001NPD9LS", "B000IMUYJM", "B001DJLD0S", "1573628174", "B0052XU4BK", "B003UGLCIA", "B00079Z9WI", "B000PMLJMQ", "B00009PY4G", "B000A2X3U2", "B0053TWVDC", "B002HML6YI", "B00005YUNE", "B00006FDBT", "B000VKL6Z2", "B000MV8AC2", "B001AGNMFI", "B00AEFYV9W", "B00018D42W", "B0013D8LAE", "B0002IQLH6", "B002LMSWN2", "B00005UQ9W", "B000S0GYRU", "B004EI2NP4", "B00AEFYYH6", "B000WC3864", "B0000CEB6Y", "B000FWHW86", "B0053TWVIM", "B006ZL1P66", "B00AEFY2LO", "B000N4RAQU", "B000TSIJWY", "B008CYDD7I", "B000FA57UI", "B0056P6SOG", "B002JT69IW", "B00CERJI5U", "B002ZG971U", "B0001EFV7M", "B002OVO18A", "0767817664", "B00006AUIG", "B005CFBZVG", "B00005NKSC", "B0000D9PNG", "B00005RHGK", "0792839706", "B00005LC4Q", "B004P7CM9Q", "B00JF5GAIW", "B00AQJ8MLY", "B002I41KNC", "B00KDU8HQQ", "B00001QGUM", "B0024FADD8", "B00DTPRZ24", "B001JV5BIA", "B003PIUINI", "B002VWNIDG", "B0021L8UPS", "B004LWZW24", "B003PIUINS", "B000Q66Q2O", "B00005K3NR", "0783230451", "B0006SGYL0", "B00023P4SS", "B0002VYOVS", "B0087ZG7UW", "B005CFBYW6", "B00006FI0R"], "bought_together": ["B00005K3NZ", "6305622760"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001B8XRT6", "6305972001", "B00004TDTO", "B001B1UO6W"]}, "price": 17.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 183485}, "asin": "0767817656", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DGRV60NAL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Candyman"}

{"description": "If Franz Kafka had been an animator and film director--oh, and a member of Monty Python's Flying Circus--this is the sort of outrageously dystopian satire one could easily imagine him making. However,Brazilwas made by Terry Gilliam, who is all of the above except, of course, Franz Kafka. Be that as it may, Gilliam sure captures the paranoid-subversive spirit of Kafka'sThe Trial(along with his own Python animation) in this bureaucratic nightmare-comedy about a meek governmental clerk named Sam Lowry (Jonathan Pryce) whose life is destroyed by a simple bug. Not a software bug, a real bug (no doubt related to Kafka's famousMetamorphosisinsect) that gets smooshed in a printer and causes a typographical error unjustly identifying an innocent citizen, one Mr.&nbsp;Buttle, as suspected terrorist Harry Tuttle (Robert De&nbsp;Niro). When Sam becomes enmeshed in unraveling this bureaucratic glitch, he himself winds up labeled as a miscreant.The movie presents such an unrelentingly imaginative and savage vision of 20th-century bureaucracy that it almost became a victim of small-minded studio management itself--until Gilliam surreptitiously screened his cut for the Los Angeles Film Critics Association, who named it the best movie of 1985 and virtually embarrassed Universal into releasing it. This DVD version of Brazil is the special director's cut that first appeared in Criterion's comprehensive (and expensive) six-disc laser package in 1996.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004ALIG0G", "B0011E5M66", "B003XURDAY", "B00000K3TS", "B000934FC2", "B0007PALZ2", "B0000CDUT5", "B001HN69AY", "B000KB4898", "B0043X1FM2", "B0018O4YT0", "0783228457", "B000BR9S96", "078401213X", "B001FOK70S", "0783229526", "B0040QYROA", "B00006CXGZ", "B0002CHIKG", "B00005JKJA", "B00007AJF8", "B000F5GNX8", "B000VE439Y", "B002IVDLGY", "B001WLMOL4", "B000055Y0X", "B004NWPY20", "B00005QAPH", "B00008RH3J", "B00000ING2", "B0007GAG42", "B000063JDE", "B0048LPRCS", "B002E01MBA", "B003102JDM", "B000E5LEV0", "B0045HCJSU", "B001CW7ZT4", "B000TXNDV6", "B001IHJ988", "B004L9GMBC", "B00006RCNV", "B005KQVE1S", "B000093NQZ", "B0000AOX0F", "B001152TL6", "1557833478", "B0050FXDDQ", "B00000IC7G", "B0000VD04M", "B00AEFXN9G", "B000274TLW", "0790742047", "B002LFPBLU", "B0057ZAA6W", "B006TTC5MM", "B002Y2BDEE", "B004ALIG4M", "B000N6TX1I", "0800195175", "B000UJ48SQ", "B000286RR0", "0792838300", "B004SUDQ72", "B000CNESU8", "B00000F3CD", "0767830555", "B00005JKPT", "B0045NXMJE", "B00065GX64", "B00004Y87O", "B001B1UO7G", "B001BEK8E2", "B00005B1ZL", "B0009X768W", "B004FQX5B6", "B00005UQ7T", "B0007UC8Y4", "B00004TJKI", "B00166UFA2", "B00003CWTI", "B00005AUKD", "B00005O3VC", "B003ELKNH2", "B000G8NXYG", "B000PAAJZ6", "B002U6DVPS", "B000059HAE", "0792841409", "B000QQH52Y", "6305428107", "B00005JMJ4", "B000A2UBNE", "B004SIP86Q", "0780022041", "B00BJC8OJ2", "6305257450", "B00005AUK9", "B00007CVS2", "B00023P4N8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000UBMSB8", "B004ALIG0G", "B0002CHK1S", "B00H9L26AA"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 74845}, "asin": "0780022181", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51WB6PY4HZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Brazil (The Criterion Collection 3-Disc Boxed Set)"}
{"description": "Ginger Rogers stars as a department store salesclerk about to be laid  off after the Christmas holiday, who happens to be passing an orphanage when a woman leaves a baby on the doorstep. The orphanage assumes that Rogers is the mother, despite her protests; when they contact the department store, the owner's son (David Niven) decides to restore her job so that she can take care of the child. Before long, rumors are flying that Niven is the child's father, which fills Niven's father (the great character actor Charles Coburn) with joy. The plot expertly weaves a deliciously funny web of assumptions and denials, with Rogers, Niven, and Coburn turning in topnotch performances--Rogers, who sometimes overplays her comic parts, is brilliantly understated in what is one of her best roles. These great actors are combined with a smart script from Norman Krasna (Mr. and Mrs. Smith,It Started with Eve) and smooth direction from Garson Kanin (My Favorite Wife).Bachelor Motheris one of the most underappreciated gems of the screwball comedy era.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302305950", "6303560067", "B000021Y6M", "6300185125", "6301586034", "B00029HOSU", "B000641ZR2", "6300185206", "6301965760", "6302641969", "6302287448"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 368894}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 19.78, "brand": "", "asin": "0780615573", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21Q7VP0C4ML.jpg", "title": "Bachelor Mother [VHS]"}

{"description": "You're better off having been born after, say, 1965, if you really want to enjoy this corny romantic comedy and its abundant references to the MTV culture of the mid-1980s--and even then the odds are only 50-50 that you'll have a shamelessly good time. But a lot of people beat those odds, becauseThe Wedding Singerwas a surprise box-office hit when released in early 1998, and it resulted inSaturday Night Livegraduate Adam Sandler's salary going ridiculously sky-high. It's a schizophrenic film about a seemingly schizophrenic wedding singer (Sandler) who's charmingly sweet to some people but a tongue-lashing maniac to others, probably out of frustration over his fading ambition as a wannabe rock star (not to mention Sandler's penchant for loud-mouthed lunacy). When he meets an admiring young waitress (delightfully played by Drew Barrymore), it's love at first sight, complicated by their pending marriages tomuchless appealing fianc&eacute;s. The plot then contorts itself to accommodate this contrived will-they-or-won't-they? scenario, so you're better off ignoring the love story and focusing on the comedy, which is sporadic but occasionally hilarious. This is also a lighter, friendlier Sandler than moviegoers had seen before, which probably accounts for the movie's success. Toss in a fine supporting cast--including a show-stopping drunk act by indie-movie stalwart Steve Buscemi--and you've got the ingredients for a no-brainer that's ultimately more fun than it is annoying.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B008R65XTC", "630529142X", "B0001Z3TXE", "B00000K3UU", "B00006ZXSL", "B00003CXPS", "B00006FMUW", "B000BKVQS4", "B00005JL93", "B00003CXSM", "B003Y5H524", "B000VXWX7E", "B00005JG6N", "B00AEBB8NS", "B00005JM4Q", "B002ZG97TW", "B00466HN7M", "B008R65XUQ", "B000A0GP0Y", "B00006ZXSK", "B0009X761E", "B000HT386M", "B001DPHDB0", "B00AEBBA2C", "B0009OL7Z4", "0783227345", "B0090SI53C", "B0000524E5", "B006LL3WP2", "B00AEFXZJE", "B001FB55MG", "B0009X760U", "B001TUZD8O", "B002PLPQLU", "6304765266", "B000AMJG4E", "B000A343RI", "B00005JPE3", "B00015YVD6", "0783235070", "B0015I2RT8", "B00AEFXIUK", "6305428425", "B00386EZKE", "B000065V3H", "B00AG473GE", "B00AEFXO8Q", "B0000C8ROV", "B000EMGJAO", "B002K0WBXW", "B0007RT9M6", "B005Z9MFRC", "B00447L4KA", "B000PHX5P0", "B000957O82", "B008RNYMG0", "B000CEV3KU", "6305428050", "0767810856", "B00AEBB9DM", "6305428549", "B001AEF6BS", "B00081912E", "B002ZG989G", "B0000DIXDR", "B001AGXEAG", "B000QQLVPQ", "B0009HBPN0", "B004H83IJQ", "B00AEFY99O", "B000P0J0EM", "B00AEFY5TI", "B00AEBB8YW", "B004HO6I2E", "B000BKJ762", "B000YDBPAM", "B00026ZG10", "B00005JL7Q", "B00003CXMP", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00029RTCG", "B00AEFXXMI", "B00AEBB8R4", "B00319ECB0", "B0013D8LHC", "B000MQC9H4", "B00005NGAY", "B002ZG988M", "B003PIUIHO", "B000E6EHE0", "B000002NJJ", "B00AEFY0KW", "0800177258", "B00007E2F5", "B002JOUNE8", "B002GHHHME", "B00003CXE4", "B008R65XNS", "B00005JKWX", "B000BUE5E6"], "bought_together": ["630529142X", "B008R65XTC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000BKVQS4", "B00466HN7M", "B00006FMUW", "B0001Z3TXE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 95282}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.99, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "0780622588", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41DZFHhVIJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Wedding Singer"}
{"description": "Repeated viewings can't dispel the shock of the final scene in this classic 1941 romantic mystery--a brief but disorienting confrontation that suddenly inverts the heroine's mounting conviction that she's married a murderer, forcing us to reconsider virtually every scene and line of dialogue that's preceded it. It's a masterful coup de grace for director Alfred Hitchcock, who has built a puzzle around the corrosive power of suspicion, threaded with deft ambiguities that toy with dramatic conventions and character archetypes in nearly every frame.As embodied by Joan Fontaine, who nabbed an Oscar in this second outing with the director, Lina McLaidlaw is a buttoned-up, bookish heiress whose prim exterior conceals longings for a more engaged emotional life. Her solution materializes in the darkly handsome Johnnie Aysgarth, a gambler, womanizer, and spendthrift who flirts, then pursues, and soon marries her. As Aysgarth, Cary Grant is both irresistible and sinister, capable of deceit and petty theft, as well as grander designs on his bride's impending fortune. Lina's passion for Johnnie is clouded by each new revelation about his apparent dishonesty, from clandestine gambling to real estate development schemes; more troubling are clues implicating him in the death of his best friend, and the prospect that Johnnie may be slowly poisoning Lina herself. By the time we see him ascending a darkened staircase with a suspicious glass of milk, an image made all the more indelible through the spectral glow the director captures in the glass, the evidence seems damning indeed.In fact, even as Hitchcock stacks the deck against Johnnie, and takes full advantage of Grant's skill at conveying such menace, the director also dots his landscape with visual clues to Lina's own neurotic (and erotic) obsessions. The final scene forces us to reevaluate her behavior while leaving enough of a cloud over Johnnie to rob him, and us, of a complete exoneration. It's a wicked, unsettling payoff to a brilliantly executed thriller.--Sam Sutherland", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300183513", "B00000F3UB", "0790743213", "6304039530", "0782006779", "630266232X", "B0000040EO", "6302413435", "0783222955", "6303120504", "080013222X"], "also_viewed": ["B00AEBB97S", "B000UVV25Q", "B000CCW2TS", "B001D8W7EK", "B001D8W7F4", "B008D1Q1VU", "B007N5YJWK", "B0002HOERG", "B000A9QK7I", "B004H83IFU", "B004UOHNAC", "B00DNQA16G", "B008D1R52E", "B007FQXEVY", "B007FQXEQO", "B001KXZGOG", "B006H37P2K", "B00DNQM7N6"]}, "price": 4.39, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 447983}, "asin": "0780626702", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41YM01J4SGL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Suspicion [VHS]"}

{"description": "There's a reason why Cindy Crawford was dubbed \"Baby Gia\" when she first hit the modeling scene. Indeed, Crawford, now the world's best-known supermodel, greatly resembled model Gia Carangi, who went from high school to the cover of BritishVoguein less than two years. Carangi appeared on many more covers ofVogue(French, British, Italian, and American) andCosmopolitanbefore dying of complications from AIDS (she was an IV heroin user) in 1986. Now most people recognize Carangi's name from this powerful HBO film that stars Golden Globe-winner Angelina Jolie, who comes by her talent honestly. Jolie is the daughter of veteran actor Jon Voight, and her own training as a model serves her well--she has the moves. Throughout, she's heartbreaking--as no doubt the real Carangi was--effective, and stunning.With good source material (Stephen Fried'sA Thing of Beauty: The Tragedy of Supermodel Gia), Jolie's stunning performance, and strong directing by Michael Cristofer, the movie goes beyond the merely sensational. The script was cowritten by Cristofer and novelist Jay McInerney, whoseBright Lights, Big Citycovers similar territory. As a cautionary tale,Giaworks. But to watch Jolie in her character's tragic self-destruction is utterly compelling.--N.F.

{"description": "Dorothy Dandridge was a Hollywood trailblazer. A confident sex symbol in the 1950s, she was the first black woman ever nominated for a Best Actress Oscar, but the electrifying stage chanteuse and dancer was forbidden to even enter the nightclubs and show rooms she performed in except from the stage. As portrayed by Halle Berry, who shepherded Dandridge's story to the screen, Dandridge is a sure, insistent star who battled racist studios and Jim Crow laws to maintain her dignity in public while stumbling through a private life marked by bad relationships and abusive lovers. Berry gives her best performance to date, brimming with ambition and moxie offstage, charming audiences with the slinky, sure moves of a nightclub veteran onstage, and convincingly \"becoming\" Dandridge in dramatic re-creations fromCarmen JonesandPorgy and Bess. Brent Spiner (Star Trek: The Next Generation) is sweet and sympathetic as her supportive, lovesick manager, and Klaus Maria Brandauer is, in Dandridge's words, a \"big old bulldog\" as director Otto Preminger. Director Martha Coolidge balances private troubles with professional milestones and setbacks and pulls no punches showing the institutional racism of late 1950s Las Vegas or the brutality of a vicious alcoholic husband. Originally made for HBO, this drama lacks the big-budget spectacle of traditional Hollywood biographies but offers in its place sharp writing, intelligent direction, and strong, sensitive performances.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005AQML", "B00AEFYG3S", "B000667HHW", "B0009S4IGA", "B00007L4KF", "B000Y11B8K", "B000B5XOSY", "B00465I192", "B004FK5EDY", "6305428409", "B000AJJNMM", "B0068FZ0W4", "B00465I1CE", "B000JLTRH2", "0790739313", "B00007AJG2", "B0006IIOHC", "B000BOH8X2", "B001P3SA94", "B000XA5JWG", "B0000560W6", "B00005RDAN", "B00066FAQW", "B000BOH922", "B003BV8I3Q", "B00441GZ1Y", "B000P0J092", "B000RO9Q7W", "B00005YU1M", "B00066FAVW", "B00EJU9GQ6", "B00DW5IL2E", "B00L6AW67I", "B00006LPHJ", "B000JJSL1W", "B000BNTMAA", "B00AEFY6TW", "B0000TWMTS", "B00066FAC6", "6306496238", "B00BTYPWDQ", "B00BYS0RQE", "B000P0J0CE", "B00066FAOE", "B003Y5H4ZC", "B0041QSZS8", "B0000714BT", "B00007AJG1", "B0007LPS7W", "B00AEFXTKO", "B0000WN0NW", "B00005JND5", "B000BOH91S", "6305505780", "B000051YMS", "B0016LFG4M", "B00G4Q3KOC", "B002CWKU36", "B00GOZ2LPM", "B003VEL8ZS", "0792838076", "B0079ZWUCA", "B000GW8RYI", "B000069I0E", "6305428336", "B000035P5I", "B00114XTHA", "B000R17RQM", "B00000JGHV", "B001K98MGE", "B004YCKJGU", "B000WMA73G", "B004MCGNS0", "B000TLOMPE", "B00000J2KE", "B0058KGHX6", "B000BITV9W", "1558908390", "B0000399WJ", "B000C03O8S", "B005CGI4O6", "B002CA68NO", "B00803PG44", "B00H47IX5G", "0060956755", "B00319ECI8", "B00CDWQNZ4", "B00AEFYNG8", "B0088RMEII", "B00067BCBI", "B004LLIRR2", "B00005U156", "B00004Y2R1", "B000784XBW", "0783230524", "B003JLL2QS", "B000BBOUHM", "B00125WAWS", "B00005ASOO", "B00GO4RGWQ"], "bought_together": ["B00005AQML", "B00AEFYG3S"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AEFYG3S", "B0009S4IGA", "B000Y11B8K", "B00007L4KF"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 152293}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 10.18, "brand": "HBO HOME VIDEO", "asin": "0783116748", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51thCNFe5gL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Introducing Dorothy Dandridge"}

{"description": "Filmed in the widescreen splendor of &quot;Panavision Super 70&quot; and blessed with the finest production values that Hollywood clout can buy, this tale of spunky Irish immigrants forgot one crucial ingredient: a decent screenplay. The film is entertaining enough, and director Ron Howard brings his technical proficiency to the simple plot, culminating in a dynamic, breathtaking depiction of the Oklahoma land rush of 1893. But the movie is really just a vacuous vehicle for married stars Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman as (respectively) the poor tenant farmer and rich landlord's daughter who flee Ireland to be American pioneers. The scenery and the stars are never less than stunning, but Howard falls short of the mark in his attempt to match the epic sweep of films by David Lean. On the other hand, this movie is certainly never boring even if it rarely makes sense, and Lean's own Irish epic,Ryan's Daughter, is a snoozer by comparison.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_viewed": ["0783223609"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 358872}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.0, "brand": "", "asin": "0783201672", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/512G5BC78GL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Far &amp; Away [VHS]"}

The IMAX print is also less wide than the theatrical version (1.66:1 versus 2.35:1) and delivers a DTS soundtrack not found on the theatrical version. Both prints are remastered and look grand.

{"description": "Ranked 34 on the American Film Institute's list of the 100 Greatest American Films,To Kill a Mockingbirdis quite simply one of the finest family-oriented dramas ever made. A beautiful and deeply affecting adaptation of the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by Harper Lee, the film retains a timeless quality that transcends its historically dated subject matter (racism in the Depression-era South) and remains powerfully resonant in present-day America with its advocacy of tolerance, justice, integrity, and loving, responsible parenthood. It's tempting to call this an important &quot;message&quot; movie that should be required viewing for children and adults alike, but this riveting courtroom drama is anything but stodgy or pedantic. As Atticus Finch, the small-town Alabama lawyer and widower father of two, Gregory Peck gives one of his finest performances with his impassioned defense of a black man (Brock Peters) wrongfully accused of the rape and assault of a young white woman. While his children, Scout (Mary Badham) and Jem (Philip Alford), learn the realities of racial prejudice and irrational hatred, they also learn to overcome their fear of the unknown as personified by their mysterious, mostly unseen neighbor Boo Radley (Robert Duvall, in his brilliant, almost completely nonverbal screen debut). What emerges from this evocative, exquisitely filmed drama is a pure distillation of the themes of Harper Lee's enduring novel, a showcase for some of the finest American acting ever assembled in one film, and a rare quality of humanitarian artistry (including Horton Foote's splendid screenplay and Elmer Bernstein's outstanding score) that seems all but lost in the chaotic morass of modern cinema.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305123616", "6301797906", "6304119046", "630150528X", "6300183513", "6300181340", "0800132009", "6301720555", "6301975987", "079284517X", "6301971736", "B000006GCU", "0783235607", "6300181286", "0800100832", "6300270971", "0792839846", "6301976932", "6302909023", "6301977297", "6301976983", "0783221347", "6300182304", "6300183629", "6304117752", "6303560040", "6304429274", "0782008348", "6300181278", "6301976061", "1558807780", "6302226899", "6304151306", "6303257844", "0790743159", "0783236352", "6301586026", "1569942072", "6300214060", "B000006N70", "0800125762", "0790733935", "6302150620", "6303168507", "6301964012", "B00005LCBP", "6301773586", "B002NZK5VO", "630197350X", "B007Y1NR1W", "0790748169", "0446310786", "6300267857", "B00066FBQG", "0792133153", "B00AEBB932", "6304259131", "B00001OWYM", "6303020089", "B00003UCB0", "630310696X", "630021639X", "6301797957", "B00005NQGQ", "079212569X", "0767825616", "6301978633", "B00004TYS8", "6305718792", "0792108868", "6305050023", "6304383177", "B000EO7AIC", "0792108280", "6301661729", "6302529484", "6304457383", "0790731975", "6303382940", "0792844645", "0792116887", "6303269834", "0792837630", "6302843200", "630197333X", "B00003CXFU", "6300269310", "6301977815", "6300267970", "B000005PFL", "0782006779", "6303313345", "6300214435", "6301670159", "B000003KHS", "630027120X", "6304429711", "B0000040EO", "630157401X"], "bought_together": ["6305123616"], "also_viewed": ["0446310786", "6305123616", "0783235607", "6302226899", "0783221347", "6300215814", "0800100832", "0783216084", "6302909023", "630150528X", "0792839846", "0800132009", "6304117752", "0792837096", "B000FQJAIW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 157532}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.63, "brand": "Universal International Home Video", "asin": "0783222955", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51C084T8V7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]"}

{"description": "After building up the duo's popularity through popular recordings and several performances onSaturday Night Live,John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd--as \"legendary\" Chicago blues brothers Jake and Elwood Blues--took their act to the big screen in this action-packed hit from 1980. As Jake and Elwood struggle to reunite their old band and save the Chicago orphanage where they were raised, they wreak enough good-natured havoc to attract the entire Cook County police force. The result is a big-budget stunt-fest on a scale rarely attempted before or since, including extended car chases that result in the wanton destruction of shopping malls and more police cars than you can count. Along the way there's plenty of music to punctuate the action, including performances by Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin, Cab Calloway, and James Brown that are guaranteed to knock you out. As played with deadpan wit by Belushi and Aykroyd, the Blues Brothers are \"on a mission from God,\" and that gives them a kind of reckless glee that keeps the movie from losing its comedic appeal. Otherwise this might have been just a bloated marathon of mayhem that quickly wears out its welcome (which is how some critics described this film and its 1998 sequel). Keep an eye out for Steven Spielberg as the city clerk who stamps some crucial paperwork near the end of the film.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783227078", "6300182150", "B000005PFL", "0800198395", "6302877881", "6301569385", "6300989003", "630220366X", "6305576173", "B000006N70", "6304071876", "6301300394", "B00005Q4GY", "6301971809", "630281622X", "0800132009", "B0000068ZQ", "6305363668", "B00005RRG6", "6301697294", "6304196954", "0783202253", "6300181987", "6301208773", "6302032377", "0800116917", "6304107250", "6303168507", "0766202771", "0783235607", "6300246965", "B000077VT7", "6302909023", "630150528X", "6304155972", "B000005QWI", "B000007PI9", "630470786X", "6300214567", "6303057225", "0792839846", "B00000JGEK"], "bought_together": ["0783227078"], "also_viewed": ["6300182150", "B000005PFL", "B00000JKNP", "B00003CXCQ", "B00G5G7EXY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 240790}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.98, "brand": "", "asin": "0783225199", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41BZ5ANGQ2L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Blues Brothers [VHS]"}

{"description": "Winner of seven Academy Awards including Best Picture, Director, and Screenplay, this critical and box-office hit from 1973 provided a perfect reunion for director George Roy Hill and stars Paul Newman and Robert Redford, who previously delighted audiences withButch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Set in 1936, the movie's about a pair of Chicago con artists (Newman and Redford) who find themselves in a high-stakes game against the master of all cheating mobsters (Robert Shaw) when they set out to avenge the murder of a mutual friend and partner. Using a bogus bookie joint as a front for their con of all cons, the two feel the heat from the Chicago Mob on one side and encroaching police on the other. But in a plot that contains more twists than a treacherous mountain road, the ultimate scam is pulled off with consummate style and panache. It's an added bonus that Newman and Redford were box-office kings at the top of their game, and while Shaw broods intensely as the Runyonesque villain,The Stingis further blessed by a host of great supporting players including Dana Elcar, Eileen Brennan, Ray Walston, Charles Durning, and Harold Gould. Thanks to the flavorful music score by Marvin Hamlisch, this was also the movie that sparked a nationwide revival of Scott Joplin's ragtime jazz, which is featured prominently on the soundtrack. One of the most entertaining movies of the early 1970s,The Stingis a welcome throwback to Hollywood's golden age of the '30s that hasn't lost any of its popular charm.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00066FBQG", "B00023P4R4", "B0019UGYK0", "B000CEXEWA", "B00008OE4W", "B000063US2", "B00441GYOM", "B00079Z9VO", "B000MNOX94", "0783240171", "B002VWNIAY", "B00001W9G0", "0792838408", "B0008ENHUI", "B006FE83UE", "B0008ENHTO", "6305128952", "B00BTYU3SK", "B000087F6M", "B00AEFXD1O", "B00407PNY2", "B00003CXBU", "B0045HCJ9E", "B00004XPPC", "B00AEFY66U", "B000ZM1MG4", "B004SEUJOQ", "6304907729", "B00008CMSX", "B0010YVCI4", "B000EHSVS2", "B00AKGG5WG", "B000FZETR0", "B00871C09S", "B0049985XW", "B0068FZ0GK", "B00005A06N", "0783226039", "B003LMPKSQ", "B000W1SZBS", "B00AEBB932", "B007STBUHI", "B00005MEOU", "B002HK9IDQ", "0767818105", "B000XJD34I", "B00008K76U", "B0000JBALO", "B0052YDMZE", "B00006ADD5", "B0087ZG7R0", "B002M2Z3BA", "B00003CXB5", "B00AEFY9GW", "B003L16F7C", "B000EHRVOW", "6304712936", "B003ZEQMH8", "B000RPCK2E", "B001KXZGO6", "B0006GAO5Y", "0790731886", "B000KX0IOU", "B000I0QL82", "B00008UALL", "B00AEBBA0E", "B0010AN7Z4", "B000YDBPAM", "B004SIP7F8", "B0000AM6IY", "B000FO0AA6", "B000BITV92", "B002VWNIBI", "B001LMAK88", "B00AATUZLU", "B0000CBY1C", "B002VWNID6", "0783225733", "B001EJW0SG", "B00006RCO1", "B007Y1NR1W", "B000O78L00"], "bought_together": ["B00066FBQG", "B0019UGYK0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00066FBQG", "B000MNOX94", "B0010YVCI4", "B00079Z9VO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 30100}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 19.99, "brand": "Universal Studios", "asin": "0783225873", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Nmqp86vQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Sting (Full Screen Edition)"}

{"description": "Notorious Puerto Rican heroin dealer Carlito Brigante (Al Pacino) is released from jail on a technicality thanks to the manipulations of his sleazy lawyer buddy (Sean Penn). All he wants is to keep his nose clean and earn enough money to start a business in the Bahamas--and maybe rekindle romance with his old flame, played by Penelope Ann Miller. Instead he finds himself back in trouble as a result of old-world codes of honor and misguided loyalties. It all takes place in 1975 Manhattan, in and around a nightclub Carlito manages, so there's plenty of classic disco music pulsing on the soundtrack. John Leguizamo plays one of the younger generation of hoodlums out to prove something. Viggo Mortensen and Luis Guzmn star as a couple of Carlito's buddies from the old days. Brian DePalma, who directed Pacino a decade earlier in SCARFACE, makes this seem almost like that film's sequel.

For those not in the know, Chucky is a mop-top kid's doll come to life with the soul of a serial killer and the voice of Brad Dourif (doing his best Jack Nicholson). Revived by his former paramour Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly, looking every inch a life-size Barbie in stiletto heels and skintight black leather), Chucky proceeds to turn his human sweetie into a pint-sized Talking Tina doll with attitude, and together they hit the road for a magic amulet and young new bodies to inhabit. They hitch a ride with sweet young runaways Katherine Heigl and Nick Stabile and leave a trail of corpses bloodied, burned, and cut to ribbons. The kids are cute, but the real heat is generated by the latex lovers who use murder as foreplay and consummate their renewed romance in a night of passionate sex (\"Shouldn't you wear a rubber?\" \"I'm all rubber!\"). Hong Kong director Ronny Yu (The Bride with White Hair) directs with a light touch and against all odds transforms walking dolls Chucky and Tiffany into funny, energetic, full-blooded characters:l'amour fouhas never been more crazy. John Ritter costars as Heigl's overprotective uncle (another obstacle on the road to dolly freedom) and Alexis Arquette is hilarious as a lanky goth nerd.

{"description": "Christopher Lambert, the imposing French actor with the nasal whine best known to American audiences as Scottish swordsmanHighlander, plays a rank amateur inThe Hunted. He's an American businessman in Japan who lucks into a one-night stand with slinky Joan Chen and winds up a witness to her murder by a mysterious band of black-clad ninjas. Escaping not one but two attempts on his life by a little quick thinking and a lot of dumb luck, he winds up on a harrowing bullet train ride. As swarms of masked assassins decimate passengers in search of the elusive eyewitness, Lambert's laconic protector, rough-edged samurai Yoshio Harada, unleashes a martial arts frenzy of flashing swords in close quarters. His savior is not as altruistic as he seems, however. He just wants to lure mysterious ninja overlord John Lone out of hiding and into a fight to the death on Harada's island fortress, and Lambert is little more than live bait. Though it made few ripples at the box office,The Huntedis a slick and surprisingly smart thriller. Lone and Harada cut striking figures as the warriors following ancient codes in the modern world, and writer-director J.F.

{"description": "The only real problem withStir of Echoeshas nothing to do with the movie itself, but with unlucky coincidence. Adapted from a Richard Mathesonnovel, this film  arrived around the same time asThe Sixth Sense, and surface similarities made it suffer by cursory comparison and the competing film's phenomenal success. It's a pity, because this one features one of Kevin Bacon's best performances, in a psychological thriller that makes a lot more right moves than wrong ones. Bacon plays a blue-collar guy who laments his ordinary life, only to learn, when his sister-in-law (Ileanna Douglas) hypnotizes him, that he is a \"receiver\" capable of seeing spirits and split-second glimpses of past and future events. It's a torturous gift to have--especially since his friendly Chicago neighborhood possesses a dark secret--and Bacon plays the role with an appropriate mixture of obsession and internalized torment.Similarity toThe Sixth Senseapplies only to the basic premise and the character of Bacon's young son. Otherwise, this is more of a hard-edged journey of self-discovery, marital crisis, and recovery, with Bacon's wife (played by the highly underrated Kathryn Erbe) involved in an underdeveloped subplot about a group of people who share Bacon's gift as paranormal \"receivers.\" Furthering his career as a writer-director of intelligent thrillers, David Koepp makes a few missteps in pacing and thematic overkill, but overallStir of Echoesis a sharp, sensitive thriller that unfolds to reveal a dramatically satisfying solution to its mystery.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEBBA2W", "B00004BZIY", "B00006AUJR", "B000VKKV3K", "B004SIP92O", "0800177789", "B00005JNY3", "6305718954", "B00007AJE1", "B000TJ6PBK", "B0001FR3IQ", "B00003CXKA", "B00AEFYYH6", "B002O3Z4Y8", "B0000648X0", "B002NZK5RI", "B00005JL3T", "0783222149", "B000V4UFZK", "B003VA3JUO", "B00003CWRF", "B000HT38IK", "B00009WVSL", "B0097C046W", "B00005JH9M", "B00008DDGY", "0783116926", "B004LWZW24", "B004AC6PV2", "B00008EY9G", "B0009X763M", "0783226837", "B0021L8UFI", "0783240295", "B00BEIYMAG", "B00011CZRE", "B00005UQ9W", "B004EPYZO4", "B002DKGWSE", "B0021L8UXA", "B0024FADD8", "B003ASLJQS", "6305161933", "155890848X", "B0001GF2D8", "B00064LJVE", "B009XTF8KQ", "B000Y7U97I", "B002GHHHN8", "B00EZ50SGW", "B00005JKZH", "B002JT69IW", "0767817737", "B00AEFYF2K", "6304711891", "B00KU2ZKKI", "0792840127", "B005LAIGOQ", "B001KKU9CI", "B001JNNDJM", "B00AZTUUQK", "B000U7169M", "B00026ZD04", "B002VWNIDG", "B002O3Z4WK", "B00AJLHUA8", "B003L20IEW", "B0002IQLHQ", "B000AM4P9K", "B00AEFY4CG", "B00IJS2OR2", "B00009PY4G", "B000OVLBGM", "B001BP4K22", "B001R3YRG2", "B0002234LS", "B0000694XX", "B00B96TGQS", "B002AT8K9W", "B000NIVJF4", "B000HC2LFI", "6305065551", "B00AIBZKV0", "B00013RC7K", "B004SUDQDG", "0792159659", "B000GFLKF8", "B0021L8UPS", "B00AEBB91E", "B000PMLJMQ", "B0001IMCFC", "B002NZK5SM", "6305428115", "B000LP6KNU", "B00006FDCD", "6304806434", "B00AEFXKZ8", "B008Y1YK7G", "B0006SGYL0"], "bought_together": ["B00AEBBA2W", "B00004BZIY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004SIP92O", "B004AC6PWG", "B00AEBBA2W", "B00004BZIY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 163731}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.99, "brand": "Lions Gate", "asin": "0784013470", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71YSZMKZKXL._SY300_.gif", "title": "Stir of Echoes"}
{"description": "Robin Williams won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor, and actors Matt Damon and Ben Affleck nabbed one for Best Original Screenplay, but the feel-good hitGood Will Huntingtriumphs because of its gifted director, Gus Van Sant. The unconventional director (My Own Private Idaho,Drugstore Cowboy) saves a script marred by vanity and clunky character development by yanking soulful, touching performances out of his entire cast (amazingly, even one by Williams that's relatively schtick-free). Van Sant pulls off the equivalent of what George Cukor accomplished for women's melodrama in the '30s and '40s: He's crafted an intelligent, unabashedly emotional male weepie about men trying to find inner-wisdom.Matt Damon stars as Will Hunting, a closet math genius who ignores his gift in favor of nightly boozing and fighting with South Boston buddies (co-writer Ben Affleck among them). While working as a university janitor, he solves an impossible calculus problem scribbled on a hallway blackboard and reluctantly becomes the prodigy of an arrogant MIT professor (Stellan Skarsg&#229;rd). Damon only avoids prison by agreeing to see psychiatrists, all of whom he mocks or psychologically destroys until he meets his match in the professor's former childhood friend, played by Williams. Both doctor and patient are haunted by the past, and as mutual respect develops, the healing process begins. The film's beauty lies not with grand climaxes, but with small, quiet moments. Scenes such as Affleck's clumsy pep talk to Damon while they drink beer after work, or any number of therapy session between Williams and Damon offer poignant looks at the awkward ways men show affection and feeling for one another.--Dave McCoy", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000FVQLQQ", "B000P0J0EW", "6305144168", "B0043X1FL8", "B00000IQV7", "B00AEFY0F2", "B0000YEEGM", "B00JPQ1INI", "B004FQX5B6", "0800141741", "B00011CZRE", "B00AEFXESQ", "B00562D3Y2", "B00125WAWS", "0783226845", "B003ASLJQS", "B00005JLRZ", "B000M341QE", "B0034G4P7G", "B002ZG99N6", "B000N4RAR4", "0767811100", "6305428352", "B000P0J0EM", "B00009W5CA", "B002NZK5UK", "B003ASLJO0", "B00003CWQR", "B004SIP7VM", "B000B8QG22", "B00005V9HH", "B001F34HRS", "B004AOECXI", "B000N6U0E2", "B00AEFXYJA", "079284646X", "B0043X1FM2", "B00AEFY17E", "B000066HAS", "B000PHVZNE", "B003AWRMC4", "B00000G3PA", "B00AEBB9F0", "B00005JKWX", "B000MZHW40", "B000Z8GZYW", "B0018CWW5K", "B000P0J0C4", "B000P0J09M", "B00004BZIY", "B00B0U2SFE", "B003AWRMCE", "B00001ZWUS", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00005B6JZ", "B00005JLSB", "B0002ZDVEU", "6305428271", "B000FKO5QK", "B00AEBB9SM", "B00007GZR5", "B001SN78JO", "B000QQLVPQ", "630587493X", "B0001ADAVK", "B004WCTLNY", "0792843592", "B00AEBBA36", "B000FVQLRA", "B00AEFXXMI", "B000XJD33O", "B0002WZTOI", "B00004XPPG", "B00008G8M4", "B00AEBB9LO", "B000056VP4", "B006VRRGNK", "6305313687", "B0006FYOTC", "B001QERPAC", "B002O3Z4WK", "B001680M26", "B00AEFY4CG", "B000YDBPAM", "B0068FZ0GK", "0767836359", "B00005JN2Z", "B000765IJK", "B00008NFR4", "630471193X", "B002NZK5VO", "B000EGDB10", "B000068MBX", "B00000J122", "B00AMSLDTM", "B000MNOX94", "B000R4SMCW", "B00009AOBI", "B000XR9L50", "B00005JOC9"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000P0J0EW", "B000M341QE", "0783226845", "B002ZG99N6"]}, "price": 8.67, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 107799}, "asin": "0788814664", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51EQNMPT51L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Good Will Hunting"}

{"description": "Martin Scorsese's 1990 masterpieceGoodFellasimmortalizes the hilarious, horrifying life of actual gangster Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), from his teen years on the streets of New York to his anonymous exile under the Witness Protection Program. The director's kinetic style is perfect for recounting Hill's ruthless rise to power in the 1950s as well as his drugged-out fall in the late 1970s; in fact, no one has ever rendered the mental dislocation of cocaine better than Scorsese. Scorsese uses period music perfectly, not just to summon a particular time but to set a precise mood.GoodFellasis at least as good asThe Godfatherwithout being in the least derivative of it. Joe Pesci's psycho improvisation of Mobster Tommy DeVito ignited Pesci as a star, Lorraine Bracco scores the performance of her life as the love of Hill's life, and every supporting role, from Paul Sorvino to Robert De Niro, is a miracle.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000C20VPA", "B000C20VRS", "B008R65XYC", "B000M341QE", "B0018CMJSU", "B0019L770A", "B0019L21GA", "B00004XPPB", "B000P0J0AG", "B0000DI87S", "B000P0J0EW", "B00003CXWV", "B00CCMKPO0", "B00G1C2URC", "B00004U103", "B00AEBB9NM", "B004SIP95G", "B002CPMB9O", "B0019L21H4", "B007TBIUSM", "B000286RP2", "B00011CZRE", "B004SIP8ZM", "B0006GAOJA", "B002T9H2LA", "B006TTC5HC", "B002VWNIEA", "0767830555", "B0000AMJEK", "B0000AM6JI", "B00005V9HH", "B004FQX5B6", "B000SFOW8I", "B00008975Z", "B002CA68N4", "6305313687", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00013RC2U", "0792174909", "B007D0FVRM", "B000A7DVR2", "B004G7XCRQ", "B002QEHPQU", "B003ASLJO0", "B000LP6KNU", "B000H5TH20", "B000P0J09C", "6305263248", "0783229526", "B00009W5CA", "B001C0I61M", "B000EHSVRI", "B00IEK9U0E", "B002ZG980U", "B004SIP7TE", "B004SIP7ZS", "B0006GAO5Y", "B00B0U2SFE", "B000ERVKBC", "B000A2UBN4", "B002AF4Y9G", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B0000714BS", "B000E5KQHI", "B00005JA8B", "B002O3Z4Y8", "B003AWRMCE", "B000P0J0EM", "1558908390", "B00080ZG10", "0767802519", "B003ELKNH2", "B003BV8I3Q", "B000035Z5G", "B00AEFXDO6", "B000E8NRBC", "B00000JGHV", "B00004RJ71", "B00AEBB9CS", "B004SIP93S", "B00AEFYSEA", "B004SIP6WW", "B003ASLJQS", "B0001Z4OXS", "B002VWNIDG", "0783225946", "B00AEBB9ZK", "B00AEFXXMI", "B0000A02TZ", "B000MZHW40", "B004SIP6GI", "B002ZG99N6", "B00AEBB95K", "B00AEFXP8K", "B00BB67UNW", "B00029RTAI", "B000P0J0D8", "B003ASLJOU", "B000Z8GZYW", "B003ASLJS6"], "bought_together": ["B000C20VPA", "B000C20VRS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000M341QE", "B0018CMJSU", "B000P0J0EW", "B00BCB1JJW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 120285}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.49, "brand": "WARNER STUDIOS", "asin": "0790729725", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41YHNBJW24L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "GoodFellas"}
{"description": "When Ridley Scott's cut ofBlade Runnerwas finally released in 1993, one had to wonder why the studio hadn't done it right the first time--11 years earlier. This version is so much better, mostly because of what's been eliminated (the ludicrous and redundant voice-over narration and the phony happy ending) rather than what's been added (a bit more character development and a brief unicorn dream). Star Harrison Ford originally recorded the narration under duress at the insistence of Warner Bros. executives who thought the story needed further \"explanation\"; he later confessed that he thought if he did it badly they wouldn't use it. (Moral: Never overestimate the taste of movie executives.) The movie's spectacular futuristic vision of Los Angeles--a perpetually dark and rainy metropolis that's the nightmare antithesis of \"Sunny Southern California\"--is still its most seductive feature, an otherworldly atmosphere in which you can immerse yourself. The movie's shadowy visual style, along with its classic private-detective/murder-mystery plot line (with Ford on the trail of a murderous android, or \"replicant\"), makesBlade Runnerone of the few science fiction pictures to legitimately claim a place in the film noir tradition. And, as in the best noir, the sleuth discovers a whole lot more (about himself and the people he encounters) than he anticipates.... With Sean Young, Edward James Olmos, Daryl Hannah, Rutger Hauer, and M. Emmet Walsh.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783225903", "B004L9GMBC", "0783226063", "B00000ILDD", "0800195175", "B0018O4YT0", "B0007PALZ2", "B00004Y87O", "B003ELKNH2", "B00AEFYDM2", "B0002CHIKG", "B00005ATQB", "B00005JL78", "0790729342", "B0045HCJKS", "0767830555", "B0002CHK1S", "B00005N5S5", "B000063JDE", "B000P0J0AQ", "B00005R2IS", "B0013LL2Z2", "B00I9TDMRM", "B0045HCJ9O", "B008MIMWP8", "B0045HCJ0S", "B00005JLWN", "B00005N7Z1", "B000YBKO6U", "B0006GAOJA", "B0007DFJ0G", "B001WLMOL4", "B00003CXXP", "6304698798", "B00000JSJC", "B000286RP2", "B003AWRMCE", "B0040QYROA", "0783228457", "B004SIP9Z6", "B002ZG980U", "079284646X", "B00079Z9VO", "B002VWNIAY", "B00005J75F", "B005LAIHXQ", "B000VECAD0", "B0000VCZK2", "B00005PJ8T", "0345404475", "B001DJLD1M", "0792839056", "B0045HCJ9E", "B0050FXDDQ", "B0045HCJGC", "B004SIP95G", "B007STBUHI", "B00006ADD5", "B00GHJ1YUI", "B003ZXDP0Q", "B000A7DVR2", "0790731932", "B000NA1WGS", "B00AMSLDTM", "B008JFUN50", "B0068FZ0O2", "B000QUCQX8", "B000E6ESEO", "B00AEFXN9G", "B004FQX5B6", "B0002KVUKM", "B0016I0AJG", "B007FQXEWI", "B000N6TX1I", "B002VWNIDG", "B00ENNBZ68", "B00K5EJHGO", "B001VLBDD0", "078401213X", "0780022343", "B0018CMJSU", "B005LAII3A", "B000OVLBHG", "B006TTC5HC", "B0049985XW", "B0000844I8", "B00005JKFR", "B00AEFY3MC", "B000BZISSU", "0783226837", "6305133476", "B000022TSY", "B000FS9FCG", "B00070FX5U", "B008MIMWQW", "B00AEBBADG", "B004GJYRKA", "B002Z7FWBI", "B000BR9S96", "B00000K3TS"], "bought_together": ["B004L9GMBC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005LAIHXQ", "B009JBWOU0", "B00HUCF7AO", "B0018O4YT0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 68358}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 10.21, "brand": "WARNER BROTHERS", "asin": "0790729628", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ST8TQP63L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)"}

{"description": "Whether or not you can sympathize with its fascistic-vigilante approach to law enforcement,Dirty Harry(directed by star Clint Eastwood's longtime friend and directorial mentor, Don Siegel) is one hell of a cop thriller. The movie makes evocative use of its San Francisco locations as cop Harry Callahan (Eastwood) tracks the elusive &quot;Scorpio killer&quot; who has been terrorizing the city by the Bay. As the psychopath's trail grows hotter, Harry becomes increasingly impatient and intolerant of the frustrating obstacles (departmental red tape, individuals' civil rights) that he feels are keeping him from doing his job. A characteristically taut and tense piece of filmmaking from Siegel (Invasion of the Body Snatchers,The Shootist,Escape from Alcatraz), it also remains a fascinating slice of American pop culture. It was a big hit (followed by four sequels) that obviously reflected--or exploited--the almost obsessive or paranoid fears and frustrations many Americans felt about crime in the streets. At a time when &quot;law and order&quot; was a familiar slogan for political candidates, Harry Callahan may have represented neither, but from his point of view his job was simple: stop criminals. To him that end justified any means he deemed necessary.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["0790733390", "079073172X", "6300216500", "0792836510", "6300269043", "0790751216", "0792837312", "6302890721", "079284100X", "6302054982", "6304429711", "0784011923", "6302610702", "6302360978", "6300182452", "0792110188", "6300263673", "B000005PF5", "0792835077", "B0000068SI", "6303020089", "630442972X", "6300214826", "6300183211", "B000003KDG", "6301976061", "B00000J2KZ", "630118663X", "0790734079", "6303212263", "6300214060", "6301327845", "0783222955", "6300271331", "B00000K2SC", "0792842464", "B000005PJ6", "6304437315", "0792133153", "6301802330", "6304025831", "6300181405", "6302787564", "0790735423", "6303029027", "0792108868", "0790751267", "6304509154", "0790705141", "B000007OY0", "6300269639", "0800100832", "6303686796", "630281622X", "6304258984", "079284517X", "0792839234", "6303920098", "0792110285", "6305622825", "6302712009", "0790733927", "6301586026", "0800125762", "6302596092", "630018224X", "0790748169", "0792839846", "6301971809", "6303506291", "6305576173", "0783223218", "6300214540", "0783241542", "6303313345"], "bought_together": ["0790733390"], "also_viewed": ["079073172X", "B005GJTZZG", "0790737744", "0790751267", "0792836510", "630118663X", "0790733390"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 365837}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.94, "brand": "", "asin": "0790731975", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41VY4VS01BL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Dirty Harry [VHS]"}

{"description": "The Band Wagon(1953) marked the culmination of a series of near-autobiographical pictures Fred Astaire made for MGM following his return from premature retirement in the late '40s. Astaire plays Tony Hunter, a fading film star (his big hit:Flying Down to Panama) who decides to return to his former glory, the Broadway stage. (In 1931, Astaire had starred on Broadway with sister Adele inThe Band Wagon, a revue that lent some of its songs to this film.) His playwright-songwriter friends (Nanette Fabray and Oscar Levant) hook him up with Broadway's hottest director, Jeffrey Cordova (a nicely hammy Jack Buchanan), who proves that the \"new\" theater traditions can be an awkward fit with the old. Hunter also finds himself at odds with his prima ballerina leading lady (Cyd Charisse), one of his chief worries being that she seems a little tall. Along the way, producer Arthur Freed, director Vincente Minnelli, choreographer Michael Kidd, and songwriters Howard Dietz and Arthur Schwartz treat us to some quintessential MGM numbers: Astaire's solo ode \"By Myself,\" the flashy arcade romp \"A Shine on Your Shoes,\" Astaire and Charisse's romantic duet \"Dancing in the Dark,\" the faux-German drinking song \"I Love Louisa,\" the manic trio \"Triplets\" (with Astaire, Fabray, and Buchanan in matching baby outfits), the Mickey Spillane-esque \"Girl Hunt Ballet,\" and the classic show-biz anthem \"That's Entertainment.\" Even if its ending and obligatory romance fall a little flat,The Band Wagonis one of the classic backstage musicals, a grandiose MGM spectacle that also manages to poke some fun at how grandiose MGM pictures had become.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301977343", "6301327853", "0792837533", "0780630157", "6302363276", "6304151306", "6305282927", "0792837630", "6303494390", "6302363292", "0783221347", "B0009J2F1E", "6301587375", "0792840836", "0792840844", "B00005LMA7", "6300183513", "B000BWIZRW", "B00000F3QZ", "6301969014", "0790743213", "6304039530", "6300215512", "6301967739"], "bought_together": ["6301977343"]}, "price": 5.95, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 386533}, "asin": "0790749467", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RDT0WX82L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Band Wagon [VHS]"}

{"description": "\"When the legend becomes fact, print the legend.\" That's more than the code of a newspaperman inThe Man Who Shot Liberty Valance; it's practically the operating credo of director John Ford, the most honored of American filmmakers. In this late film from a long career, Ford looks at the civilizing of an Old West town, Shinbone, through the sad memories of settlers looking back. In the town's wide-open youth, two-fisted Westerner John Wayne and tenderfoot newcomer James Stewart clash over a woman (Vera Miles) but ultimately unite against the notorious outlaw Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin). Ford's nostalgia for the past is tempered by his stark approach, unusual for the visual poet ofStagecoachandThe Searchers. The two heavyweights, Wayne and Stewart, are good together, with Wayne the embodiment of rugged individualism and Stewart the idealistic prophet of the civilization that will eventually tame the Wild West. This may be the saddest Western ever made, closer to an elegy than an action movie, and as cleanly beautiful as its central symbol, the cactus rose.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300988473", "B0000TANUI", "6301798090", "6301802330", "0792110188", "B000051S3Z", "0792107683", "6300268470", "0792107128", "6300181715", "0782008348", "B000M7BEPQ", "6300267938", "630197705X", "0790741040", "6301797922", "6300267830", "6301736362", "6304457308", "0792105907", "0792102320", "6300183041", "0792108868", "6300268799", "1555265952", "078321541X", "B00004RFFA", "B001E419N8", "6300216012", "6300208281", "6300181588", "6303192254", "6301662962", "6302923042", "6300269884", "630442972X", "6304673019", "6300246965", "6304457316", "6300215733", "6303393985", "0790751216", "630150528X", "6301805518", "0792838556", "6304457278", "B0000022WA", "6301718275", "6304441630", "B00005RRG6", "079283853X", "B0000TANUS", "6300184951", "B000M5BRX2", "6303120474", "6303334598", "6302751136", "0790743159", "6303471730", "6303109918", "6300216209", "6301976924", "6301972163", "6301773586", "6302226899", "6300213676", "B00004WZR1", "6302360978", "6301978110", "6301797906"], "bought_together": ["B000M7BEPQ"], "also_viewed": ["6301802330", "6300267938"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 230138}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.92, "brand": "", "asin": "0792106989", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51AQQ4TCP1L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance [VHS]"}
{"description": "Fifteen years after John Carpenter squandered a great idea on a mediocre movie (Escape from New York), he does it again--this time on the Left Coast. Kurt Russell is back as the terminally cynical one-eyed action hero Snake Plissken who, this time, has been coerced into saving the world in Los Angeles. It's 2013 and L.A. is now an island maximum security prison off the coast of California. Snake has 10 hours to find a doomsday weapon that's fallen into the hands of revolutionaries before he dies of a virus with which he's been injected. But the action is clumsy and unimaginative: lots of shootouts and very little suspense. Even the bad guys aren't particularly inventive; only Pam Grier, as a transsexual gang leader, strikes any sparks. Russell growls his way through the role but can only blame himself: He cowrote the script with Carpenter.--Marshall Fine", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792845684", "6300214656", "6304288433"], "bought_together": ["0792845684"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 433813}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.95, "brand": "", "asin": "0792142926", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DEZDZYFEL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Escape From La [VHS]"}

{"description": "When the theatrical release of James Cameron'sTitanicwas delayed from July to December of 1997, media pundits speculated that Cameron's $200&nbsp;million disaster epic would cause the director's downfall, signal the end of the blockbuster era, and sink Paramount Studios as quickly as the ill-fated luxury liner had sunk on that fateful night of April&nbsp;14, 1912. Some studio executives were confident, others horrified, but the clarity of hindsight turned Cameron into an Oscar-winning genius, a shrewd businessman, and one of the most successful directors in the history of motion pictures.Titanicwould surpass the $1&nbsp;billion mark in global box-office receipts (largely due to multiple viewings, the majority by teenage girls), win 11&nbsp;Academy Awards including best picture and director, produce the best-selling movie soundtrack of all time, and make a global superstar of Leonardo DiCaprio. A bona fide pop-cultural phenomenon, the film has all the ingredients of a blockbuster (romance, passion, luxury, grand scale, a snidely villain, and an epic, life-threatening crisis), but Cameron's alchemy of these ingredients proved more popular than anyone could have predicted. His stroke of genius was to combine absolute authenticity with a pair of fictional lovers whose tragic fate would draw viewers into the heart-wrenching reality of theTitanicdisaster. As starving artist Jack Dawson and soon-to-be-married socialite Rose DeWitt Bukater, DiCaprio and Kate Winslet won the hearts of viewers around the world, and their brief but never-forgotten love affair provides the humanity that Cameron needed to turnTitanicinto an emotional experience. Present-day framing scenes (featuring Gloria Stuart as the 101-year-old Rose) add additional resonance to the story, and although some viewers proved vehemently immune to Cameron's manipulations, few can deny the production's impressive achievements. Although some of the computer-generated visual effects look artificial, others--such as the sunset silhouette ofTitanicduring its first evening at sea, or the climactic splitting of the ship's sinking hull--are state-of-the-art marvels. In terms of sets and costumes alone, the film is never less than astounding. More than anything else, however, the film's overwhelming popularity speaks for itself.Titanicis an event film and a monument to Cameron's risk-taking audacity, blending the tragic irony of theTitanicdisaster with just enough narrative invention to give the historical event its fullest and most timeless dramatic impact.Titanicis an epic love story on par withGone with the Wind, and like that earlier box-office phenomenon, it's a film for the ages.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305123616", "6304117752", "6301792734", "6303215734", "B00000JS61", "6304178352", "6303396623", "6303314015", "B00003CXTF", "0769403468", "6301734734", "6302936381", "6303300480", "6305368139", "B00005RRG3", "6302610702", "0792839846", "6300207919", "B000P0J0C4", "6304546262", "B000056BRF", "6304400551", "6303101267", "630150528X", "6303637574", "B000P0J0EW", "6305126062", "6302935148", "0800199421", "6304681496", "0792116887", "6301963911", "B0000DCGT1", "B00001IVED", "6305169187", "B00006RCST", "6300216721", "630197879X", "0800113055", "076780922X", "080010367X", "0800141326", "0800184319", "6304039522", "B000066AXC"], "bought_together": ["6305123616"], "also_viewed": ["B009VQHDSQ", "6303314015", "B0074JODXU", "B00003CXTF", "B003JQZXWW", "6302787068", "6301796535", "0788812807", "0788806270", "B00005JKDQ", "6304500831", "6305229449", "6304117752", "6300213668", "6304089767", "B0000AQZYM", "079213690X", "6303049079", "6305123616", "6303402348", "6301792734", "0788812408", "B00079HZSE", "B000035Z2S", "B00000K3AN", "0788805843", "6302526574", "B0000029YC", "6303534422", "6303215734", "B0070285YE", "B00008LDO9", "0783216084", "6304434340", "B00BBND56G", "0788805533", "6300183211", "6302320402", "6305750750", "B0002CHI3S", "0790748266", "6304143184", "B0000040CM", "B005X7H9SQ", "B00004RFHF", "B00005V1Z7", "6302814782", "6301572688", "B00000JS61", "B008SLUWZG", "6303257844", "B00078XGO2", "0790736039", "B0000040EJ", "B000065U6Q", "B00003CX7L", "B00000ADKZ", "6300263673", "6302178924"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 65950}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.47, "brand": "Paramount", "asin": "0792151712", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21BAWEVBJ1L.jpg", "title": "Titanic [VHS]"}

There's also a seductive villainous with the suggestive name of Xenia Onatopp (Famke Janssen), and the great actress Judi Dench makes her first appearance as Bond's superior, M, who wisecracks about 007's &quot;dinosaur&quot; status as a globetrotting sexist.

{"description": "Australian director Peter Weir had made several excellent films beforeThe Year of Living Dangerouslywas released to critical acclaim in 1983, but it was this moody tale of romance and political upheaval that bought Weir and star Mel Gibson their tickets to Hollywood. (Weir's next film was the 1985 Harrison Ford hitWitness.) Set in Indonesia in 1965, the film focuses on a group of Caucasian journalists and photographers who are in Jakarta to cover the political upheavals that are threatening to collapse the unstable government of President Sukarno. Gibson plays an Australian correspondent named Guy Hamilton who's determined to get the best story, and he's given invaluable assistance from Billy Kwan (Linda Hunt), a half-Indonesian, half-Australian photojournalist who knows the culture inside and out. Billy introduces Guy to Jill (Sigourney Weaver) and their romance develops in an atmosphere of political unrest and constant personal danger. This journalistic adventure is compelling in itself (and Hunt's gender-switching performance won her a much-deserved Oscar), but it's Weir's creation of a rich, authentically exotic locale that gives the movie its alluring and subtly mysterious atmosphere. A tale of tragedy and survival, it's also a story about fascinating people at a turbulent juncture of history, and the empathy they feel for each other and the culture that surrounds them.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0140065350", "B00BTYJYR6", "B00004Y87L", "B00005QAPI", "B001C47ZOW", "B00000153L", "B001DJLD08", "B000056KMW", "0780021134", "B000001FJZ", "B000MRA542", "B000TXNDV6", "B00KE3B9US", "B00K6D1SAC", "B00DL48BM6", "B00CPTUOI2", "B0000C0FM4", "B00005RRK1", "B00019073K", "B00FGVS07S", "B00441GYOM", "B004NTXH7C", "B0000TG8XY", "B000GG4Y32", "B00I3C1T34", "B0008GGN9I", "B0045HCIZE", "B000CEXEWA", "0783233523", "0783230591", "B00004RF83", "B00824FK9W", "B00J5LXT44", "B002HR456E", "B0000DGKI8", "B00005UJYA", "B005IX3C72", "B0001DCYUU", "B00GSBMNOQ", "B0007ZEOPK", "B001VC99HQ", "0783226853", "B00JVFRLIE", "B00JVQ7QTM", "B00049QJ9I", "B00007ELD1", "B003LMPKSQ", "B00IYJFB2G", "B00BGARGR8", "0792845773", "B003O7I6SE", "B00004TIT4", "B001AXL67W", "B001EKP5D2", "B007Y1NR1W", "B000FFJYAW", "B000ECX0J2", "B004WPYO7E"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00BTYJYR6", "B00IWULQQ2", "B00004Y87L"]}, "price": 15.29, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 208013}, "asin": "0792836006", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51H3DPF3ZSL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Year of Living Dangerously"}
{"description": "InThe Bad and the Beautiful, Kirk Douglas plays a tyrannical, manipulative producer fallen on hard times. To get back on his feet, he asks for help from three Hollywood giants whose careers he helped launch--a director (Barry Sullivan), an actress (Lana Turner), and a writer (Dick Powell). Unfortunately, they all hate him. Flashbacks explain why. Douglas had been close to all three at different points in his career: He and the director started out together making B-movies, he gave the wayward actress her first starring role, he turned the novelist into a successful screenwriter.  Then in one way or another he stabbed each of them in the back, though not always deliberately. The script has a lot of backstage  clich&eacute;s, but Vincente Minnelli's sharp, energetic direction, the gorgeous black-and-white  cinematography, and the topnotch performances--particularly Douglas and Gloria Grahame, who won an Oscar for her sweet role as the writer's cheerful Southern wife--flesh out the clich&eacute;s with cutting details and convincing bile.

{"description": "A stirring example of courage and the indomitable human spirit, for many John Sturges'sThe Great Escapeis both the definitive World War II drama and the nonpareil prison escape movie. Featuring an unequalled ensemble cast in a rivetingly authentic true-life scenario set to Elmer Bernstein's admirable music, this picture is both a template for subsequent action-adventure movies and one of the last glories of Golden Age Hollywood. Reunited with the director who made him a star inThe Magnificent Seven, Steve McQueen gives a career-defining performance as the laconic Hilts, the baseball-loving, motorbike-riding \"Cooler King.\" The rest of the all-male Anglo-American cast--Dickie Attenborough, Donald Pleasance, James Garner, Charles Bronson, David McCallum, James Coburn, and Gordon Jackson--make the most of their meaty roles (though you have to forgive Coburn his Australian accent). Closely based on Paul Brickhill's book, the various escape attempts, scrounging, forging, and ferreting activities are authentically realized thanks also to technical advisor Wally Flood, one of the original tunnel-digging POWs. Sturges orchestrates the climax with total conviction, giving us both high action and very poignant human drama. Without trivializing the grim reality,The Great Escapethrillingly celebrates the heroism of men who never gave up the fight.--Mark Walker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0007TKNM4", "B00004XPPC", "B0008ENHUI", "B00407PNY2", "B000MGTQ7U", "B000059TFW", "B000O78L00", "B000A2WJBQ", "B003PIUII8", "0792839730", "B003ASLJPE", "B000CNESN0", "B0007TKNGA", "B000EHSVS2", "B000EHSVSC", "B00005N5S3", "B00005PJ8S", "B003AWRMCO", "B0009HKH6Q", "B00BLA94IM", "B00AEFYPHA", "B0019UGYK0", "B00AEFY9YY", "B00AEFYBA6", "B00006ADD5", "B0008ENHTY", "B000ASDFHC", "B004R6JG7Q", "0792844017", "B0008ENHTO", "B00001ZWUS", "0790731460", "B00BL9NQ00", "B00AEFXD1O", "B00DDT0JB0", "B001PO556E", "B0049985XW", "B0045HCJ9E", "B00066FBQG", "B007N31YH0", "B000FZETR0", "B0006GANN2", "B00008DDGW", "B00096S4B2", "B0008ENHUS", "B00008PC0Y", "B002VWNIAY", "B003AWRMBA", "B0045HCJTO", "B000062XEX", "B00AEBBA0E", "B004ZRFQCG", "B000MGTQ7K", "B003ASLJRC", "B00CLH0848", "B00005N5S2", "B00441GYYC", "0783226853", "B000O599YO", "B0001AVZBW", "B003AWRMCE", "B004GSVXBW", "B000NTPG6Q", "0393325792", "B00AEFYTEY", "B000FFJYCU", "B0000CBY1C", "B001SV3LL0", "B00005QCVP", "B00079Z9VO", "B00005JN9P", "B00005JKF6", "B003ZEQMH8", "B00008AOTO", "B000O78L0U", "B001DDBD4K", "B000JJSJPK", "0783225733", "B000P0J0EW", "B009YX8MSG", "B0001NBMH6", "B0008ENHV2", "B0006419M8", "B002GHHHP6", "B003INBNOS", "B000CEXEWA", "B000BGR1B4", "B00005LC4D", "B007Y1NR1W", "B0050FXDDQ", "145164261X", "B000O599VC", "B00AEBB9UK", "B000EHSVOG", "B002O3Z4WU", "0767824555", "B004AOECXI", "B00AEBB9NM", "B00008AOTR", "B0013D8M4E"], "bought_together": ["B00004XPPC", "B0007TKNM4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00J4BW0SQ", "B00407PNY2", "B0007TKNM4", "B000059TFW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 1464}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.82, "brand": "Mgm/Ua Studios", "asin": "0792838408", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510N2J46JDL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Great Escape"}

The Soviets counter the threat with a so- called &quot;Doomsday Device,&quot; and the world hangs in the balance while the U.S. president (Peter Sellers) engages in hilarious hot-line negotiations with his Soviet counterpart.

{"description": "Cliffhangerwas a 1994 comeback of sorts for action hero Sylvester Stallone, this time thanks to director Renny Harlin (Die Hard 2andNightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master) and some spectacularly rugged and vertigo-inducing high- mountain terrain. The opening sequence alone delivers what the title promises, and there's a doozy of an airplane stunt that was later reprised, with modifications, inAir Force One. Stallone, looking as tough and craggy as the mountains themselves, is a rescue climber who finds himself going after a gang of crooks (headed by John Lithgow in his bad-guy mode) who've hijacked a U.S. Treasury plane and crash landed in the Rockies (played by the Italian Dolomites) with millions of bucks. Outrageous action-packed, snow-packed, and scenery-packed chase sequences (featuring whirring helicopters, whooshing skis, popping gunfire, and clanging pitons that earned the movie Oscar nominations for sound and sound editing) take full advantage of the digital video disc's Dolby Digital 5.1 sound.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0045HCJG2", "B0045HCJ5S", "B000U1ZV62", "0783226934", "B0045HCJGC", "1558908846", "6304779631", "B000QUCRB4", "B00003CXQG", "B0045HCJFS", "B001B3LIOC", "B0004Z33G4", "6304602944", "B0001FGBWK", "B000MEYKEG", "B000056PNL", "B0006GANOQ", "B002GHHHH4", "6304806434", "B00003CXTM", "B002AT8KA6", "B004SIP6WW", "B000U1ZV8K", "B0000VV5BM", "B002GHHHME", "B00015YVDG", "B0015XHP2C", "B0006HBZXS", "6304711891", "B000QXDCLU", "B000N4RAS8", "B00315462E", "0783225547", "B00E8G5HQE", "B00441GYY2", "0767803434", "B008NP4ZUU", "B000JYW5BE", "B0002S94CK", "B000U1ZV4Y", "B001M9ELQC", "B00026ZG10", "B00AEFY6PQ", "B000CEV3M8", "B00000G3PA", "B001KRVLCI", "B00HZMZ2FE", "B0004Z33EG", "B0050MB5NO", "B000BMY2N8", "B00070FX5U", "B00AEFXKZ8", "B00005ATZT", "B000FI8MPW", "B00005N5S5", "6304765258", "0790732149", "B000B8GT92", "B00441GYXI", "B00158K0QU", "B0045HCIWW", "B000BPL2FQ", "B00AEBB9UK", "B000055Y0Y", "B002GHHHL0", "0790736411", "B00008L3UQ", "0767802497", "B0015XHP4A", "B000YCPUWW", "B002GHHHP6", "B007AFBYYY", "0783225504", "B00005JKIP", "0767810872", "B003ASLJMW", "B000E0WJLE", "B00005T7HZ", "B001ECDVK4", "B003ASLJOU", "0767807588", "B002AS464Q", "1558908315", "B000EHSVPK", "B002NZK5UU", "B00009WVSL", "0783225733", "0792835727", "B000EGDB10", "0783230346", "B0006IIPL2", "B003KV3E2M", "B00004Z4WR", "B003AWRMCE", "B000U1ZV6C", "0767804252", "B0001Z37HM", "B0041QSZLA", "B0002V7OI8", "B002NZK5R8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0045HCJGC", "B0045HCJG2", "B002GHHHH4", "6304602944"]}, "price": 7.47, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 1056590}, "asin": "0800127803", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/312HH0TBH9L.jpg", "title": "Cliffhanger"}

{"description": "Bill Murray does warmth in his most consistently effective post-Stripescomedy, a romantic fantasy about a wacky weatherman forced to relive one strange day over and over again, until he gets it right. Snowed in during a road-trip expedition to watch the famous groundhog encounter his shadow, Murray falls into a time warp that is never explained but pays off so richly that it doesn't need to be. The elaborate loop-the-loop plot structure cooked up by screenwriter Danny Rubin is crystal-clear every step of the way, but it's Murray's world-class reactive timing that makes the jokes explode, and we end up looking forward to each new variation. He squeezes all the available juice out of every scene. Without forcing the issue, he makes us understand why this fly-away personality responds so intensely to the radiant sanity of the TV producer played by Andie MacDowell. The blissfully clueless Chris Elliott (Cabin Boy) is Murray's nudnik cameraman.--David Chute", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00004RJ73", "B00287Z18Y", "6305609764", "B00005PJ6O", "B007P9HW3M", "0790740044", "B00AEFXXMI", "0783227388", "6305236569", "B00000IQBW", "B000E33W1W", "0804141444", "B0009RCPY8", "B0019HQICW", "B001AGXEAG", "B00AEFXDO6", "0767818105", "0792844890", "B002O3Z4YI", "B0000A14TA", "B0014Z4OMU", "B000K7VHTQ", "B00AEBBA2M", "B00005Y71F", "B00AEBB9SM", "B002GOAGZC", "B000G6BLW4", "B001IHJ988", "B00008G8LM", "B001LXIDVI", "B000QQLVPQ", "B005LL817W", "B001LMAK9W", "B00AEBB9DM", "0767806808", "B008R65XKQ", "B000G6BLWE", "B00003CXC3", "B00005O5CM", "B000065V3P", "B00005JM4Q", "B00AEBB9E6", "B000ELJAEM", "B00AEFYS2M", "B00AEFY0F2", "0767836324", "B002T51X4Q", "0800195175", "B0009X760U", "B000A3XYIM", "B000VBIGD6", "B000069HYF", "B00003CXR4", "0790742071", "B00AEFY3MC", "B000PHVZNE", "B0000YTP02", "B000E6ESI0", "B000YDBPAM", "B007Y1NR1W", "B00158K0QU", "B00006FMUW", "B00BLN4UPG", "B00AEFYM2S", "B000HT3PPG", "B000056HEA", "B000068NNU", "B0045HCJ7G", "B000V4UFZK", "B004GJYRA0", "B004AOECXI", "B000YAF4MA", "B00AEFXPG2", "B0045HCIY0"], "bought_together": ["B00004RJ73", "B00287Z18Y"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00004RJ73", "B00005PJ6O", "B000E33W1W", "B00287Z18Y"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 107101}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.42, "brand": "", "asin": "080017948X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21XPDM6RK1L.jpg", "title": "Groundhog Day"}

{"description": "Marlon Brando's famous \"I coulda been a contenda\" speech is such a warhorse by now that a lot of people probably feel they've seen this picture already, even if they haven't. And many of those who have seen it may have forgotten how flat-out thrilling it is. For all its great dramatic and cinematic qualities, and its fiery social criticism, Elia Kazan'sOn the Waterfrontis also one of the most gripping melodramas of political corruption and individual heroism ever made in the United States, a five-star gut-grabber. Shot on location around the docks of Hoboken, New Jersey, in the mid-1950s, it tells the fact-based story of a longshoreman (Brando's Terry Malloy) who is blackballed and savagely beaten for informing against the mobsters who have taken over his union and sold it out to the bosses. (Karl Malden has a more conventional stalwart-hero role, as an idealistic priest who nurtures Terry's pangs of conscience.) Lee J.

{"description": "Overview\nFormer vice president Al Gore shares his concerns on the pressing issue of global warming in this documentary. A long-time environmental activist, Gore first became aware of evidence on global warming in the 1970s, and since leaving public office he has become a passionate advocate for large- and small-scale changes in our laws and lifestyles that could help alleviate this crisis. An Inconvenient Truth records a multi-media presentation hosted by Gore in which he discusses the scientific facts behind global warming, explains how it has already begun to affect our environment, talks about the disastrous consequences if the world's governments and citizens do not act, and shares what each individual can do to help protect the Earth for this and future generations. An Inconvenient Truth was directed by Davis Guggenheim, a veteran documentary filmmaker who also has an extensive background in episodic television.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JPXA", "B0013D8LHM", "B0027BOL4G", "0670062723", "B004IN75D0", "B0042EJD8A", "B00018U8YE", "B000YKI4MM", "B00147F8WS", "B0012Q3T72", "B0002OXVBO", "B000UNYJXQ", "B003M987AG", "1594865671", "B000I5Y8FU", "B001C17EVE", "B00005JMXX", "B001MWGZ6S", "B002PLMJ74", "B00366E1AK", "B001EP8EOY", "B000BTH4K4", "B000RPCJSE", "B002RB56W2", "B001EUSYHQ", "B0019KAQB8", "B004SO26RE", "B000BI5KV0", "B005OCJJ9M", "B002RX8G5E", "B005YFGIZM", "B000PY52IG", "B0041KKYBA", "B00AZMFNX2", "B001KWB0L0", "B003FNQ0I0", "B0069UP2PI", "0812982894", "B003Q6D28W", "0674058178", "B000BJS4FS", "B003Q6D28C", "1405187360", "B005YFGIZ2", "B0019A35G6", "B000OUCEZU", "B005ZMBDJK", "1594867348", "B00FGVS0DM", "B000MQ4WX8", "B005TZFZK6", "0312428928", "B0053ZHZI2", "B0055V6EX6", "B008NNY98U", "0767805712", "B00APG8QQO", "1586481983", "B002KLALEC", "B00DPUB5LK", "B003GSLVX8", "B00AEFXPSK", "B001E0KSAM", "B008LW2520", "B0009GX1EM", "B000WLUXZE", "B003CAKXAC", "B000CPHAAG", "B00IWULQQ2", "1931930007", "B00EL6AAEU", "B00013F2S6", "B005LAIH4A", "B000B0WO4O", "B006ZAPSJW", "B000EOTEM2", "0521732557", "B0007DBJM8", "B0018PH3NI", "B00CMDPTA4", "B004JR3OKI", "B00744WZ8U", "B0025XUTKQ", "B001M0N8UQ", "B0040QYRS6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005JPXA", "B0027BOL4G", "0670062723", "B004SO26RE"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 50499}, "asin": "1415724784", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51p%2Btk39UpL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "An Inconvenient Truth"}

{"description": "If you're not a connoisseur of graphic horror and gruesome gore, you'd better steer clear of this wicked 1992 horror-comedy from the demented mind and delirious camera of New Zealand-born writer-director Peter Jackson. However, if nonstop mayhem and extreme violence are your idea of great entertainment, you're sure to appreciate Jackson's gleefully inventive approach to a story that can judiciously be described as sick, twisted, and totally outrageous. The movie's central character is a poor schmuck named Lionel who's practically enslaved to his domineering mother. But when ol' Mum gets bitten by a rare and poisonous rat monkey from Skull Island and is turned into a flesh-eating zombie, Lionel has the unfortunate task of keeping Mama happy while fending off all the other zombies that result from her voracious feeding frenzies. If you've read this far, you'll either be crying out for censorship or eagerly awaiting your first viewing (or second, or third...) of this wildly clever and audaciously uninhibited movie. And while director Jackson would later achieve critical success with his fact-based dramaHeavenly Creatures, his talent is readily evident in this earlier effort. If you find this kind of thing even remotely appealing, considerDead Alivea must-see movie.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00004Z1GI", "B008CYDD7I", "B0002C9DK4", "B00005KH30", "B0001611DI", "B000065FS6", "B005J9ZFQG", "B000F3UA8E", "B000068IEV", "B0024FAG44", "0783227434", "B000WC3864", "B000RPCK2O", "0783228457", "B001D5C1OO", "B00009YXHN", "B000JU7JIW", "B000GIXCL0", "B002VKB0KG", "B00004TJM8", "B000S0GYRU", "B000094J72", "B0002VYOVS", "B0000DC12T", "B0036R92US", "B000T28POC", "B001B187L6", "B00JQYV0B4", "B00000K3TO", "B001BP14MG", "B000068TPD", "B000I2J68M", "B001D5C1R6", "B000096I9V", "B000HXDWRS", "B000FS9FE4", "B0001LQJMQ", "B0002KQNL8", "078322799X", "B00D7AM6M0", "078062856X", "B00125WATQ", "B0001ZX0GK", "B0007WQHI0", "B0000AOX0F", "B002GHHHG0", "B000E1P2EY", "B00JF5GAIW", "B0053TWV46", "B0053TWW9K", "B0013D8LAE", "B000CR76U8", "B001MEJY8W", "B008874968", "B0057O6IMS", "B00005N5RM", "B0053TWW36", "B0009WFEDC", "B002E01MHY", "B000TJ6PB0", "B0009OUBC4", "B000HXDWNM", "6304852444", "B00005K3O4", "B00IF8Q0YE", "B000WC389G", "B00DWG5GIA", "B0002DB5PO", "B003Q6D246", "B000TSIJWY", "B00GGY4R3K", "B00DI012O2", "B000S0GYRK", "B001J710Y8", "B00GHH9IIA", "B005J9ZE5I", "B002EOVXBK", "B0002CHK1S", "B004KDYR20", "B0000A9D19", "B001D262LA", "B000V4UH08", "B000HT38B2", "B0024FADD8", "B000TZJCMS", "B001FOK70S", "B000MV8AC2", "B005OT810I", "B000KRNG54", "B004EI2NP4", "B00KDU8HQQ", "B005CM1IES", "B0000CEB6Y", "B000TZJCN2", "B000RIWAV2", "B002OVO18A", "B001I82RVS", "B002HML6YI", "B001CW7ZWG", "B00005JO16"], "bought_together": ["B00004Z1GI", "B008CYDD7I"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005R24K", "B008CYDD7I", "B0024FADDI", "B000068IEV"]}, "price": 59.9, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 15538}, "asin": "157362408X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZD8DCJAWL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Dead Alive"}

{"description": "As bad asFriday the 13th, Part 2is, it's a work of art in comparison to the rest of theFriday the 13thflicks that came afterward. This installment officially introduced us to Jason Voorhees as the killer (if you remember Drew Barrymore's fatal phone quiz inScream, you know that the killer in the firstFriday the 13thwas actually Jason's mother), and made the slicing and dicing even more generic. Survivor Alice is dispatched within the first 10 minutes, and we're left with plucky Ginny (Amy Steel, doing a fairly decent Jamie Lee Curtis impression) to do battle with the monstrous Jason. Ginny's part of a another group of horny teenagers (less intelligent as well as less attractive than their predecessors) who try to resurrect Camp Crystal Lake five years after the initial murders--a pretty mean feat, considering this movie was made only a year after the first one. Being a smarty-pants child-psychology major, Ginny tries to outwit the dim Jason, and at one point dons the bloody and moldy sweater of Jason's late mother (which is more disgusting than any of the killings beforehand) in an attempt to confuse the masked killer. Jason may not be the brightest bulb on the tree, but the only one who's going to pull the wool--or in this case, the burlap--over his eyes is Jason himself, who wears a sack with one eyehole throughout the movie to hide his deformed features (he finally found his way to a sporting-goods store and his trademark hockey mask appears in the third installment of the series). Directed by Steve Miner, who also helmed the nextFriday the 13thfilm (in 3-D no less) as well as the more reputableHouse,Forever Young, andHalloween: H20.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300214311", "6300214087", "6300214605", "6300218058", "6300214656", "6301094352", "6301589025", "6302975832", "6304288433", "6302921058", "6301562925", "6303579388", "B00000JQTO", "B00023NRSM", "6303396585", "630428845X", "6304136242", "0792846311", "6304509146", "B000Q66Q56", "B001NPD9LS", "B0000039A6", "B00008HCCJ", "0780627032", "0792846710", "6305095566", "6300189015", "6303031846", "B0000VCZMU", "B00000JLWS", "B00004YS5K", "6300182770", "6304451024", "630026999X", "6302038286", "6300214672", "630130053X", "6304509154", "6301249038", "0792839242", "6300147630", "6300267881", "B00000JQTR", "6302038308", "0764005693", "6300262545", "0792836634", "6300182878", "6301427076", "6301024443", "6300262855", "0790705141", "6304370458", "0792846303", "6300182339", "6303917410", "6303566391", "6303651917", "6304508611", "B00004RNAC", "6301415817", "B000005XXG", "6302814731"], "bought_together": ["6300214311", "6300214605"], "also_viewed": ["6300214087", "6300218058", "6300214311", "6300214605", "6300214656", "6301094352", "6301589025", "0780627032", "B001NPD9LS", "B00DEQQK8S", "6304288433", "B00023NRSM", "0792836634", "6303579388", "6300189015", "B002YICNE2", "B0000039A6", "B00AEFY22I", "B00005LC4Q", "6301871952", "6300271072", "6302921058", "630428845X", "B000H1XYGY", "B0002JP572", "6304240562", "B00KDU8HQQ", "B00000JQTR", "B00H83EV5W"]}, "price": 12.75, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 175626}, "asin": "6300214192", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41JDMGVJ8WL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Friday the 13th 2 [VHS]"}
{"description": "This 1985 adventure directed by Barry Levinson (Rain Man) and written  by Chris Columbus (Gremlins) may not have much to do with the Sherlock  Holmes of Arthur Conan Doyle's invention. But it is a delightful and somewhat  unexpected combination of exciting elements: Victorian-era, foggy-London  mystique, Gothic horror, and Indiana Jones-like exotica. Nicholas Rowe plays  Holmes as a schoolboy at a boarding academy for young men. Paired with the  owlish, reticent young Watson (Alan Cox), Holmes embarks on the solution of a  mystery that involves a hallucinatory and lethal drug, and a religious cult celebrating ancient Egyptian rites of mummification. Levinson makes handsome  and crisp work of this Steven Spielberg production, without a trace of the  treacle that often found its way into other Spielbergian projects at the time  (The Goonies). Rowe is wonderfully  convincing as a teen incarnation of the Great Detective, and while Cox mostly  maintains Hollywood's traditionally unflattering idea of Watson, he does  bring warmth and comedy to the role. The cast includes Freddie Jones as an  eccentric inventor, Anthony Higgins as the villain, and Sophie Ward as  Holmes's love interest.--Tom Keogh", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 536183}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.74, "brand": "", "asin": "6300214508", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51NPVMVW7WL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Young Sherlock Holmes [VHS]"}
{"description": "This splatter flick, along with John Carpenter'sHalloween, helped spawn the great horror-movie movement of the '80s, not to mentioneightsequels, many of which had nothing to do with the films that preceded them. It also gave birth to Jason Voorhees, one of the three biggest horror-movie psychos of the modern era (the other two beingHalloween's Michael Myers andA Nightmare on Elm Street's Freddy Krueger). Forever duplicated, the originalFriday the 13thpopularized a number of themes and techniques that today are now clich&eacute;s: the increasingly gory murders, the remote forest location, the anonymous and nubile cast, the murderer as cult hero, and, of course, the moral that if you have sex, you will die, very painfully. Still, if you have to see aFriday the 13thmovie, this is the one to check out. A group of eager (and horny) teenagers decide to reopen Camp Crystal Lake, which 20 years earlier was closed after the shocking and mysterious murders of two amorous camp counselors. You can take it from there, as the teens get picked off one by one, during a dark and stormy night; of course, their car won't start and there's no phone. The ending stole shamelessly from Brian De Palma'sCarrie, but it still provides a slight if campy shock. Look for a young Kevin Bacon as the requisite stud--you can tell that's what he is because when the cast appears in swimsuits, he's wearing a Speedo--who's the beneficiary of the film's best murder sequence, an arrowhead to the throat. Right after having sex, of course.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300214192", "6300214311", "6300189015", "6300214605", "B00023NRSM", "6301589025", "6301094352", "6300218058", "6302921058", "6305095566", "630428845X", "6300214656", "6300267881", "0792839234", "6304288433", "B00000JQTO", "6304136242", "0780627032", "6302038308", "6302975832", "0792846311", "6303917283", "6301562925", "0784011923", "0790705141", "B000AMW2TK", "B00005B238", "0783216084", "0764005693", "B0013D8LAE", "6304509154", "630130053X", "B000VKL6Z2", "630196666X", "6303396585", "B00IF8Q0YE", "6303579388", "6300182878", "6303265715", "6304983794", "6300214176", "6302180015", "6304361025", "6304509146", "6300262855", "B00008HCCJ", "0792836634", "6302516919", "6300146383", "6303257879", "B0000039A6", "6303265693", "B009CSVQOU", "B00000JQTR", "6300147630", "6301574117", "0783235607", "6300214672", "6300213714", "6304370458", "630026999X", "6305363668", "6303257674", "6301427076", "6302798450", "6304910010", "6305814694", "6300262731", "0792835018", "6301024443", "0792110285", "6300268993", "6304508611", "B0000VCZMU", "6300182975", "6304113404", "1558807381", "6303920098", "6300182339", "B00000IQUT", "B00004RNAC", "6300185249", "6300987744", "0792845684", "6300183181", "B00000F0I2", "6302797632", "0792846303", "0792839242", "B0009A2PQI", "6300181642", "0764006770", "0792836677", "B00004WLXE"], "also_viewed": ["6302921058", "6300214192", "6300214311", "B00023NRSM", "6300214605", "6300214656", "6301094352", "6301589025", "0780627032", "6304288433", "6300218058", "6300189015", "B00AZ7V0W0", "B0002JP572", "630428845X", "6305095566", "0792839234", "B00DEQQK8S", "0792836634", "6303824382", "0767817664", "B00078XGO2", "6300182878", "6303265693", "B000RIWAVW", "0792116887", "B000VKL6Z2", "6304508611", "B002YICNE2", "6301562925", "B00ETHN9L2", "B00AEFY22I", "0451150899", "6301792734", "B00GHH9IIA", "6304509154", "B000FS9FE4", "B00AQJ8MLY", "B005CM1IES", "6301794982", "6301708695", "6300267881", "B00008HCCJ", "6300181278", "6303422020", "6304983794", "0783235607", "6300214176", "6303579388", "6305399409", "B00005B6ND", "6304240562", "6302814359", "630274461X", "B00D7AM71A", "0792839242", "6301589955"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 232095}, "asin": "6300214087", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71PWYF6B3GL._SY300_.gif", "title": "Friday the 13th 1 [VHS]"}

Crosby and Kaye are song-and-dance men who hook up, romantically and professionally, with a \"sister\" act (Clooney and Vera-Ellen) to put on a Big Show to benefit the struggling ski-resort lodge run by the beloved old retired general (Dean Jagger) of their WWII Army outfit.

Hoffman plays a sullen and cowardly loner haunted by the suicide of his father, a suspected communist. He is drawn into a murky web of international intrigue when his brother, CIA agent Doc Levy, played by Roy Scheider (Jaws,The French Connection), is murdered by a former Nazi (Laurence Olivier) who has come to the United States to reclaim a valuable stash of diamonds. Babe (Hoffman) must confront his fears of the past as he runs for his life and tries to avenge his brother's death at the same time.

{"description": "Back when the  firstStar Trekfeature was released in December 1979, theTrekfranchise was still relatively modest, consisting of the original TV series, an animated cartoon series from 1973-74, and a burgeoning fan network around the world. Series creator Gene Roddenberry had conceived a second TV series, but after the success ofStar Warsthe project was upgraded into this lavish feature film, which reunited the original series cast aboard a beautifully redesigned starship U.S.S.Enterprise. Under the direction of Robert Wise (best known forWest Side Story), the film proved to be a mixed blessing forTrekfans, who heatedly debated its merits; but it was, of course, a phenomenal hit. Capt. Kirk (William Shatner) leads his crew into the vast structures surrounding V'Ger, an all-powerful being that is cutting a destructive course through Starfleet space. With his new First Officer (Stephen Collins), the bald and beautiful Lieutenant Ilia (played by the late Persis Khambatta) and his returning veteran crew, Kirk must decipher the secret of V'Ger's true purpose and restore the safety of the galaxy. The story is rather overblown and derivative of plots from the original series, and avid Trekkies greeted the film's bland costumes with derisive laughter. But as a feast for the eyes, this is an adventure worthy of big-screen trekkin'. Douglas Trumbull's visual effects are astonishing, and Jerry Goldmith's score is regarded as one of the prolific composer's very best (with its main theme later used forStar Trek: The Next Generation). And, fortunately forStar Trekfans, the expanded 143-minute version (originally shown for the film's network TV premiere) is generally considered an improvement over the original theatrical release.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300214400", "6300213803", "6301543408", "6303202004", "630021463X", "6303909949", "B0000AUHOH", "B00008OSD3", "6301792734", "6305587159", "6300182304", "B0000A36J1", "B000065U6Q", "6304415346", "6305365121", "630336568X", "0671830880", "6300214060", "6304935811", "6302380588", "6303651488"], "bought_together": ["6300213803", "6300214400"], "also_viewed": ["6300213803", "6301543408", "B00DB97LRC", "6300214400", "630021463X", "B00BAXTYIA", "B00005JLRT", "6303202004", "B00DB97LCM", "B00000ILBK", "B002I9Z8DK", "B0000AUHOH", "B002I9Z8B2", "6304415346", "6304539258", "B000USUA8Y", "B002I9Z8CG", "B0095XPZBC", "B002I9Z8GW", "B001TH16DI", "B0083TUEHY", "B00HETWFVC", "630273486X", "B000HEWEJ4", "6303909949", "6300213668"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 278050}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.79, "brand": "", "asin": "6300216802", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4164CYFHC6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Star Trek - The Motion Picture [VHS]"}

{"description": "Director Robert Zemeckis (Forrest Gump,Contact) had a hit with this 1984 comedy that first teamed Michael Douglas, Kathleen Turner, and Danny DeVito.

The chemistry between the stars is infectious (the trio went on to make a sequel,Jewel of the Nile, and then an interesting, dark comedy directed by DeVito,The War of the Roses).

{"description": "Blood Simplemade it clear that the cinematically precocious Coen brothers (writer-director Joel and writer-producer Ethan) were gifted filmmakers to watch out for. But it was the outrageously farcicalRaising Arizonathat announced the Coens' darkly comedic audacity to the world. It wasn't widely seen when released in 1987, but its modest audience was vocally supportive, and this hyperactive comedy has since developed a large and loyal following. It's the story of \"Ed\" (for Edwina, played by Holly Hunter), a policewoman who falls in love with \"Hi\" (for H.I. McDonnough, played by Nicolas Cage) while she's taking his mug shots. She's infertile and he's a habitual robber of convenience stores, and their folksy marital bliss depends on settling down with a rug rat. Unable to conceive, they kidnap one of the newsworthy quintuplets born to an unpainted-furniture huckster named Nathan Arizona (Trey Wilson), who quickly hires a Harley-riding mercenary (Randall \"Tex\" Cobb) to track the baby's whereabouts. What follows is a full-throttle comedy that defies description, fueled by the Coens' lyrical redneck dialogue, the manic camerawork of future director Barry Sonnenfeld, and some of the most inventively comedic chase scenes ever filmed. Some will dismiss the comedy for being recklessly over-the-top; others will love it for its clever mix of slapstick action, surreal fantasy, and homespun family values. One thing's for sure--this is a Coen movie from start to finish, and that makes it undeniably unique.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0790750414", "6303953425", "6301797957"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 206770}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 0.94, "brand": "", "asin": "6300249964", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71621XK1MRL._SY300_.gif", "title": "Raising Arizona [VHS]"}

{"description": "Douglas Sirk puts theoperaback intosoap operain this exquisitely baroque melodrama, the epitome of Technicolor gloss. Rock Hudson (as wonderfully wooden as ever) and Lauren Bacall play stalwart examples of altruism, clean living, and good old American ambition, but Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone steal the film as white trash millionaire siblings stewing in self-pity. The plot reads like an episode ofDallas: Texas oil-baron playboy Stack steals good girl Bacall from best friend Hudson while Stack's sister Malone puts her slinky moves on Hudson, the strapping poor boy made good. Toss in impotence, jealousy, alcoholic binges, emotional blackmail, and backstabbing nastiness, mix vigorously with high style and expressionist flourishes, and you've got the most potent melodrama cocktail of the 1950s. Stack twists his arch delivery into the practiced bravado of a boozing womanizer nursing an inferiority complex while Malone sashays and flirts her way through an Oscar-winning performance as a slutty, sassy good-time girl. It's so over the top that it might seem kitschy at first glance, but former theater director Sirk subtly shades his vision in the shadows of film noir and uses the portentous angles and gaudy color to create a vivid, vivacious world of glossy surfaces and social masks cracking under the pressure of responsibility and the pain of lost love.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783215096", "6300183890", "B006VRRGOO", "B000HA4WSO", "B0009ML2KQ", "B000ION7AI", "6304239149", "6301706587", "6303364772", "1572520922", "6301973410", "6301975987", "6301977084", "6300215741", "6300269795", "6301973313", "6302278929", "6302000661", "630197333X", "630150528X", "0800100832", "B000BWIZRW", "B002TOL49Q", "630310245X"], "bought_together": ["0783215096", "6300183890"], "also_viewed": ["B00514JKKG", "B001ILTUL0", "B000JJRBFY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 291274}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.59, "brand": "", "asin": "6301045750", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515JMNXTQML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Written on the Wind [VHS]"}

{"description": "Joseph Mankiewicz's moody classic is less ghost story than romantic fantasy, a handsome 1947 drama of impossible love set on the picturesque turn-of-the-century New England coast. Independent young widow Lucy Muir (the luminous Gene Tierney), desperate to escape her uptight in-laws, falls in love with a grand seaside house and moves in, only to discover the cantankerous ghost of the hot-tempered Captain Gregg (a histrionically flamboyant performance by Rex Harrison). Lucy refuses to let the bombastic captain frighten her away, earning his respect, his friendship, and later his love. They team up to turn the captain's salty memoirs into a bestseller, but as his affection grows he fades away, leaving Lucy free to undertake a more worldly suitor, notably a charismatic children's author (George Sanders at his smarmy smoothest) with his own guarded secret. Charles Lang's melancholy black-and-white photography and Bernard Herrmann's haunting score set the tone for this sublime adult drama, and Tierney delivers one of her most understated performances as the resolute Mrs. Muir. Mankiewicz turns this ghost story into a refreshingly mature and down-to-earth romance.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["630266232X", "6302320496", "6302227127", "630150528X", "0767825616", "630197350X", "0792151712", "B00005A1VH", "6303402070", "B00003OSTO", "6303057225", "6300988791", "B00000JKNL", "6301773586", "0783235593", "6301977688", "0783221347", "6301586050", "6301964012", "0780614097", "6300183912", "6305126062", "6301670140", "6301978536", "6301972171", "6303120474", "6301969049", "6303364772", "B0000068Z8", "6301797906", "1558807780", "0783236352", "B000GX4476", "6302130379", "B00000IBME", "B003MG6FJY", "6301628616", "6303209890", "0790743159", "6300181340", "B000CQD1ZS", "B000006FR5", "B00000F13X", "6301797957", "6301986040", "6302464889", "5559477621", "6300267970", "6302800897"], "bought_together": ["6302320496"], "also_viewed": ["6304005490", "0783235593"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 113812}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 10.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6301586042", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HEY8NM3EL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Ghost &amp; Mrs Muir [VHS]"}

{"description": "In this 1982 courtroom drama written by David Mamet and directed by Sidney Lumet, Paul Newman found the perfect role for a transitional period of his stellar career. As alcoholic Boston lawyer Frank Galvin, Newman shook off his screen persona as a handsome, blue-eyed hunk to portray an aging, weary man whose best years are behind him, with a shot-glass future that looks very bleak indeed. But when Galvin is given a chance to redeem himself--by proving medical negligence in the case of a comatose woman--he makes one final effort to regain his self-respect and tarnished reputation. He's an underdog against formidable odds, facing a powerful, politically connected lawyer (James Mason, slick as ever) who will do anything to win his case, regardless of professional ethics. Further complicating matters is a woman (Charlotte Rampling) who only appears to be worthy of Galvin's trust and love, until Galvin's best friend and colleague (Jack Warden) proves otherwise. Excellent as both courtroom drama and riveting character study, the film crackles with Mamet's sharp dialogue; and Lumet's direction is a brilliant example of forceful restraint. The film gave Newman one of the best roles of his career; many felt he deserved the Oscar (he lost to Ben Kingsley inGandhi) that would belatedly be given to Newman forThe Color of Money. Along withHud,Cool Hand Luke, andButch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,The Verdictranks highly as a signature performance by one of America's all-time greatest actors.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00441GYOM", "6303451462", "0790741040", "0792841859", "B000006N70", "6302479487", "6300214567", "6302130379", "0782008348", "6303072798", "0783235593", "5559477621", "B00005QATY", "6300182479", "630146494X", "6304458975", "0800116917", "6302226899", "0790743213", "0800142039"], "bought_together": ["B00441GYOM"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 217321}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.9, "brand": "", "asin": "6301599896", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Q67JB37ML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Verdict [VHS]"}

{"description": "Michael Douglas, Kathleen Turner, and Danny DeVito reunited for a third time to fabulous effect in this dark, disturbing comedy of martial trauma and revenge, which couldn't be more different from their sunnier outings inRomancing the StoneandThe Jewel of the Nile. Douglas and Turner, in career-best performances, are the materialistic, consumer-driven Roses of the title (Oliver and Barbara) whose seemingly perfect marriage has soured beyond repair; their only point of contact, aside from their two college-bound kids, is their meticulously maintained dream house, which Douglas bought and Turner decorated to perfection. When Turner gets a taste of financial independence, she asks Douglas for divorce--all she wants is the house and everything in it (aside from his clothes and shaving kit). He laughs at her and she punches him in the face. Things only get worse from there, as nasty divorce proceedings (with DeVito as Douglas's lawyer) give way to insults, threats, ruined dinner parties, and pet abuse. And through it all, the Roses begin destroying their beloved home and its contents, just  to spite each other. DeVito, who also directed, takes Michael Leeson's blacker-than-black screenplay and gives it a hyperstylized spin, complete with skewed camera angles and wonderfully expressionistic cinematography (by Stephen Burum) as Douglas and Turner barricade themselves in their house, both refusing to give an inch. Shocking for a mainstream studio picture, with its unsympathetic protagonists, escalating bitterness, and disturbing finale,Rosesis a poisonously funny valentine to both marriage and '80s materialism, tempered only by its framing device as a cautionary tale.

{"description": "Showered with Oscars, this wonderfully bitchy (and witty) comedy written and directed by Joseph&nbsp;L. Mankiewicz concerns an aging theater star (Bette Davis) whose life is being supplanted by a wolf-in-sheep's-clothing ingenue (Anne Baxter) whom she helped. This is a film for a viewer to take in like a box of chocolates, packed with scene-for-scene delights that make the entire story even better than it really is. The film also gives deviously talented actors such as George Sanders and Thelma Ritter a chance to speak dazzling lines; Davis bites into her role and never lets go.

{"description": "George Cukor helped transform a moody Victorian stage melodrama (previously filmed in Britain in 1939) into a gothic Hollywood romantic thriller. Ingrid Bergman stars as a meek, uncertain heiress courted and married in a whirlwind romance by the debonair Charles Boyer, but when they move back into her childhood home she begins losing her grip on reality and becomes convinced that her husband is trying to drive her insane. Joseph Cotten, rather stiff and colorless next to the anguished Bergman and charming and lively Boyer, is the heroic Scotland Yard detective who becomes enamored of the skittish woman who is slowly succumbing to madness. The grand, glorious sets and elegant photography recall Hitchcock'sRebecca, another lush Hollywood gothic melodrama of a retiring young wife overwhelmed by the history of her abode, andGaslightis still assumed by some to be a Hitchcock film (the Bergman connection doesn't help the confusion). It's really a rather straightforward thriller with a forced plot device, but under Cukor's control the tightly constructed script is given the full MGM treatment, then reined in for intimate moments of harrowing suspense. Boyer brilliantly played off his continental lover reputation by adding an undercurrent of malevolence and Bergman won an Oscar for her haunted performance. It also marks the memorable debut of Angela Lansbury as a saucy maid unwittingly drawn into Boyer's master plan.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301973410", "6301798503", "B000003KE0", "6301967410", "630266232X", "B002GSXKQA", "6301670159", "6301967496", "1558807780", "6304359721", "6303396623", "6301607929", "079074676X", "6302842263", "6303364772", "6301968905", "B000021Y6K", "6300215644", "6303360025", "6300183912", "6301670140", "B00000F13X", "6303560040", "B00004TX24", "6303562248", "6300181111", "6302725542", "6302806348", "6301647734", "6302299497", "6301978536", "6301564456", "0783236352", "6301797957", "B00000JKNL", "630197350X", "0792107683", "6301720555", "6302413435", "6301975987", "6302226899", "6300251152", "6300988791", "0792840836", "6304457383", "079073463X", "630365164X", "6301965620", "B00029HOSU", "B00000F13T", "6302878527", "6304039530", "B00004TX2C", "6300246973", "0782006779", "6300183513", "6301327853", "B0000048PO", "6304152450", "6300182304", "6301586026", "B00000F3UB", "6301973305", "6302797667", "6300209415", "0800100832", "6301628454", "6300215717"], "bought_together": ["6301670159"], "also_viewed": ["6301798503", "630266232X"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 251911}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.95, "brand": "MGM/UA Home Video", "asin": "6301969316", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41DRWZSGKYL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Gaslight [VHS]"}
{"description": "Walker (Lee Marvin) strides through Los Angeles with the steel-eyed stare of a stone-cold killer, or perhaps a ghost. Betrayed by his wife and best friend, who gun him down point-blank and leave him for dead after a successful heist, Walker blasts his way up the criminal food chain in a quest for revenge. Did he survive the shooting or return from the grave, or is it all a dying dream? The question is left in the air in John Boorman's modern film noir, a brutal revenge thriller based on Richard Stark's novelThe Hunter(remade by Brian Helgeland asPayback), set in the impersonal concrete and steel canyons of Los Angeles and eerily empty cells of Alcatraz. Walker kills without remorse, guided by shadowy \"informant\" Keenan Wynn, whose own agenda is carefully concealed, and assisted by Angie Dickinson, as he desperately searches for someone, anyone, who can just give him his money. But if Walker is an extreme incarnation of the revenge-driven noir antihero, the modern syndicate has been transformed into a world of paper jungles and corporate businessmen, an alienating concept to the two-fisted, gun-wielding gangster. Boorman creates a hard, austere look for the film and fragments the story with flashes of painful memory, grafting the New Wave onto old genres with confidence and style. Haunting and brutal,Point Blankremains one of the most distinctive crime thrillers ever made.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302752329", "6300269035", "6302032237", "6300251217", "6304508557", "0792841484", "6300181723", "6302413400", "B00005LCAQ", "630197204X", "6301967909", "6300182878", "B00004STJA", "0792110269", "0790733897"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 389970}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.0, "brand": "", "asin": "6301971876", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21AB3CJQT6L.jpg", "title": "Point Blank [VHS]"}

{"description": "A hallmark of the science fiction genre as well as a wry commentary on the political climate of the 1950s,The Day the Earth Stood Stillis a sci-fi movie less concerned with special effects than with a social parable. A spacecraft lands in Washington, D.C., carrying a humanoid messenger from another world (Michael Rennie) imparting a warning to the people of Earth to cease their violent behavior. But panic ensues as the messenger lands and is shot by a nervous soldier. His large robot companion destroys the Capitol as the messenger escapes the confines of the hospital. He moves in with a family as a boarder and blends into society to observe the full range of the human experience. Director Robert Wise (West Side Story) not only provides one of the most recognizable icons of the science fiction world in his depiction of the massive robot loyal to his master, but he avoids the obvious camp elements of the story to create a quiet and observant story highlighting both the good and the bad in human nature.--Robert Lane", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000HDNPM0", "6300215539", "6301327845", "6304507348", "6301977815", "6300208508", "6300181278", "0800132009", "6302120101", "6302797667", "6300181340", "6304233639", "6300183513", "0790743213", "6300181286", "6300183580", "6300269566", "6300183084", "0783235593", "0783221347", "6302884705", "0783235607", "6302763835", "0783236352", "630442972X", "6300215644", "0800116917", "0790752395", "0790743159", "6300182533", "630266232X", "6300269477", "6302605164", "6300185974", "B00005B238", "0782008348"], "bought_together": ["6300215539"], "also_viewed": ["6300208508"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 312863}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.34, "brand": "", "asin": "6302168465", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51QGHTN64FL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Day the Earth Stood Still [VHS]"}

{"description": "In 1940, MGM produced two pictures spanning the life of legendary inventor and thinker Thomas Alva Edison. This sequel to YOUNG TOM EDISON (starring Mickey Rooney) is a thought-provoking portrait of the man behind some of the most important inventions of the 20th century. On the 50th anniversary of Edison's greatest invention, the incandescent lightbulb, the elderly man thinks back on his life and his most creative period. He remembers the early setbacks in his career, his undaunting determination, and his happy family life with his wife, Mary Stillwell (Rita Johnson). This well-researched biopic features a remarkable lead performance from Spencer Tracy, who spent a period of time in Edison's hometown of Menlo Park, New Jersey, where he stayed in his laboratory and researched his journals and letters. In an attempt to create continuity between the two Thomas Edison projects, MGM hired the same screenwriters to work on both pieces.", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301976274", "6302922941", "6302308577", "6301720571", "6301969049", "B00005Q4GZ"], "bought_together": ["6301976274"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 339428}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 18.35, "brand": "", "asin": "6302208912", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21D7WGQCYGL.jpg", "title": "Edison the Man [VHS]"}

{"description": "F.W. Murnau changed the name and ghastly appearance of his villain, but this unauthorized version of Bram Stoker'sDraculacouldn't fool the Stoker estate, and it became the center of a lawsuit that almost resulted in its complete destruction. Thankfully this masterpiece survives (though in a somewhat altered form), for despite its liberties with the novel, this 1921 horror classic remains the most beautiful and resonant interpretation of Stoker. Though the plot remains essentially the same--naive real-estate clerk Thomas (Gustav von Wangenheim) is sent abroad to finalize a sale with the nocturnal Count Orlock (the hideous-looking Max Schreck), who imprisons Thomas and travels to England to claim Thomas's beautiful young wife, Ellen (Greta Schroder), as his own--the visual realization creates a very different story. Schreck plays the vampire as a grotesque demon, with his claw-like hands, bald head and sharp, bat-like ears, and he rises from his coffin with an supernatural stiffness, like a tent pole pulled upright. When the eerily empty ghost ship carrying his coffin arrives in Thomas's home port, a river of rats pours out and spreads through the town like a plague. Perhaps the most noticeable changes from the novel are the absence of Van Helsing and the richer realization of Ellen, the would-be victim, whose innate sensibility and solemn spirituality give her a spooky connection with the vampire. With his stark, symbol-laden visual scheme and sacrificial conclusion, Murnau creates a more mythic tale than any subsequent adaptation of Stoker's novel.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000067JAW", "6300183084", "6303626424", "6300183092"], "also_viewed": ["630526323X", "B00HRUQ8X4"]}, "price": 24.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 311149}, "asin": "6302194296", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41VWHHY3ZJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Nosferatu [VHS]"}

The bishop is trying to build a new cathedral, and he's so entrenched in his fundraising that he's watching his own marriage crumble around him.

Fink thinks the job is beneath him, but his desire for acceptance gets the better of him, and he suddenly finds himself holed up in a fleabag hotel in Los Angeles, where he is almost immediately afflicted with writer's block. Various distractions begin to enter his life, first in the form of a famous southern writer (John Mahoney) whom Fink idolizes, and then his neighbor in the hotel, a seemingly amiable salesman played by John Goodman (Sea of Love,Raising Arizona). The writer turns out to be a self-loathing drunk whose secretary (Judy Davis) is the one actually doing the writing. And the neighbor, the working-class hero who Fink made his reputation writing about, may have a horrifying secret of his own.

{"description": "British thespian and sophomore director Kenneth Branagh follows up his adaptation of Shakespeare'sHenry Vwith this abrupt change of pace, a slick, stylish thriller evocative of Hitchcock, classic film noir, and gothic shockers. Sporting an exaggerated American accent, Branagh stars as L.A. private eye Mike Church, a hard-boiled but softhearted detective who takes on the case of a mysterious amnesiac (Branagh's then-real-life wife, Emma Thompson). With the help of an offbeat furniture dealer and part-time hypnotist (Derek Jacobi), Grace (as Mike has named her) dredges up her hidden memories. Little do they realize that her recollections are of a past life in L.A.'s recent history, and as she recounts the details of a famous marriage that ended with a notorious murder (played out as black-and-white flashbacks starring Branagh and Thompson), events of the present begin to mirror the past, as if fate were pulling the two into fatal replay of history.

{"description": "Star Trek Vleft us nowhere to go but up, and with the return ofStar Trek IIdirector Nicholas Meyer,Star Trek VIrestored the movie series to its classic blend of space opera, intelligent plotting, and engaging interaction of stalwart heroes and menacing villains. Borrowing its subtitle (and several lines of dialogue) from Shakespeare, the movie finds Admiral Kirk (William Shatner) and his fellowEnterprisecrew members on a diplomatic mission to negotiate peace with the revered Klingon Chancellor Gorkon (David Warner). When the high-ranking Klingon and several officers are ruthlessly murdered, blame is placed on Kirk, whose subsequent investigation uncovers an assassination plot masterminded by the nefarious Klingon General Chang (Christopher Plummer) in an effort to disrupt a historic peace summit. As this political plot unfolds,Star Trek VItakes on a sharp-edged tone, with Kirk and Spock confronting their opposing views of diplomacy, and testing their bonds of loyalty when a Vulcan officer is revealed to be a traitor. With a dramatic depth befitting what was to be the final movie mission of the originalStar Trekcrew, this film took the veteran cast out in respectably high style. With the torch being passed to the crew ofStar Trek: The Next Generation, only Kirk, Scotty, and Chekov would return, however briefly, inStar Trek: Generations.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301543408", "630021463X", "6300213803", "6304415346", "6300216802", "6300214400", "6305587159", "6303909949", "B00008OSD3", "B000003K8T", "B000ECVAVW", "B000AA4FII", "6303944736", "B0001DI5W6", "6302424216", "6302510031", "B00005JLTM", "6304047843", "6302510023", "6302380294", "B0000068SI", "B0001VL30O", "B00000K2SC", "6301966988", "6305363668", "6302380596", "B00004TYS8", "0792839846", "B0002TT0NM", "B0000A36J1", "B000005QWI", "B00000JGEK", "630281622X"], "bought_together": ["6301543408", "6300213803"], "also_viewed": ["6301543408", "6300213803", "630021463X", "6300214400", "6300216802", "630273486X", "B00471JSRE", "6304415346", "B00BAXTYIA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 158198}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 0.99, "brand": "", "asin": "630242335X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51XTS50JFQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Star Trek VI - The Undiscovered Country [VHS]"}

{"description": "Though it wasn't Hammer Studios' final film,Frankenstein and the Monster from Hellcan be considered its swan song, an intelligent, inventive, stylized reworking of the themes that had sustained the series for almost two decades. Dr.&nbsp;Frankenstein has buried his old identity and reigns over an insane asylum as Dr.&nbsp;Victor (Peter Cushing under a flamboyant blond wig in his sixth and final turn as the mad scientist) as if it were a live-parts yard for his continuing experiments. With the help of an ambitious acolyte he builds his latest creature, a hirsute apelike brute stitched together from the asylum's most promising inhabitants and turned into a sad, tortured slave. The film was shot at the end of Hammer's glory days, and the budgetary constraints can be seen in unconvincing miniatures and the rather bulky and stiff ogre suit, but the dark, claustrophobic sets create an effectively gloomy atmosphere. Director Terence Fisher effectively pulls out all stops for a marvelous sequence of the creature digging through the asylum graveyard in the middle of a flashing electrical storm, a demonic twist on the iconic gravedigging images that go all the way back to the 1931Frankenstein. This was the last reunion for Cushing and Fisher, who together gave birth to Hammer's gothic reign withThe Curse of FrankensteinandHorror of Dracula. Fisher retired after finishing the film.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302814669", "6303149189", "0792846761", "6302843227", "630252542X", "6300181820", "6300185443", "6302884713", "6300183084", "6302843219", "0792845552"], "bought_together": ["6302814669"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 356145}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 29.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6302491975", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Y0KF0QVDL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Frankenstein &amp; The Monster From Hell [VHS]"}

{"description": "Since Adolf Hitler had the audacity to borrow his mustache from the most famous celebrity in the world--Charlie Chaplin--it meant Hitler was fair game for Chaplin's comedy. (Strangely, the two men were born within four days of each other.)The Great Dictator, conceived in the late thirties but not released until 1940, when Hitler's war was raging across Europe, is the film that skewered the tyrant. Chaplin plays both Adenoid Hynkel, the power-mad ruler of Tomania, and a humble Jewish barber suffering under the dictator's rule. Paulette Goddard, Chaplin's wife at the time, plays the barber's beloved; and the rotund comedian Jack Oakie turns in a weirdly accurate burlesque of Mussolini, as a bellowing fellow dictator named Benzino Napaloni, Dictator of Bacteria. Chaplin himself hits one of his highest moments in the amazing sequence where he performs a dance of love with a large inflated globe of the world. Never has the hunger for world domination been more rhapsodically expressed. The slapstick is swift and sharp, but it was not enough for Chaplin. He ends the film with the barber's six-minute speech calling for peace and prophesying a hopeful future for troubled mankind. Some critics have always felt the monologue was out of place, but the lyricism and sheer humanity of it are still stirring. This was the last appearance of Chaplin's Little Tramp character, and not coincidentally it was his first all-talking picture.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302561841", "6302561949", "6302561957", "6301095294", "6302561833", "630181214X"], "bought_together": ["6302561841"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 288707}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.88, "brand": "", "asin": "630256185X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71J4N8JPWYL._SY300_.gif", "title": "Charlie Chaplin: Great Dictator [VHS]"}
{"description": "Certainly, Charlie Chaplin at this point in his career (1952) had earned the right to reflect on his years as an entertainer, and could make his film as overlong and soppy and sentimental as he darn well pleased. But that doesn't mean the rest of us have to abet this kind of melodramatic indulgence. Chaplin stars as Calvero, a fading clown who helps a paralyzed dancer regain the use of her legs and achieve great fame, but of course at grave cost to Calvero. The film is famous for featuring the only onscreen teaming of Chaplin with the other legendary comic of the silent era, Buster Keaton, and is equally infamous for Chaplin having allegedly cut out most of Keaton's best bits in their sequence together. How much Chaplin sabotaged his own movie to keep Keaton from shining has been much debated, but consider: In Keaton's autobiography, he calls Chaplin the greatest screen comic of all time. In Chaplin's autobiography, he never mentions Keaton.--David Kronke", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302561833", "B004ZMBKOE", "6305576173", "630181214X", "6302561841", "B00017LVQE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 406142}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 31.45, "brand": "", "asin": "6302561965", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5117NGNVB1L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Charlie Chaplin: Limelight [VHS]"}
{"description": "Harrowing, funny, and immediately addictive, the 1979 British television series Danger UXB stars Anthony Andrews as Army Lieutenant Brian Ash, an engineering student whose excitement about his rapid commission as an officer during World War II is tempered by his unenviable post with a bomb disposal unit. Assigned to a fatality-heavy team that defuses unexploded German bombs scattered throughout London during the blitz, Ash faces down his terror and eventually becomes the closest thing to an expert one can be dismantling sometimes booby-trapped ordnance. In doing so, he earns the respect of his superiors as well as from the enlisted men working under him, and his protracted survival is nothing short of miraculous considering the tragic number of friends and colleagues Ash loses.\nThere is a dark side, however. The longer Ash sticks with his unit, the more obsessive he becomes about his responsibility to keep London safe. Meanwhile, his nerves grow frayed and his morale collapses. Ash's desperate romance with a married woman (Judy Geeson) provides him little to hold onto, and when a true crisis ambushes his spirit toward the end, one can't be sure if he's headed for the scrap heap of permanent casualties. Based on the recollections of an actual wartime bomb disposer, Danger UXB was created by John Hawkesworth, who later produced (and wrote many episodes for) the fantastic Sherlock Holmes TV series starring Jeremy Brett. Despite many tense moments in Danger UXB's 13 episodes--one is always expecting a bomb to blow away a favorite character--the show is also graced by great humor (Ash's crew sometimes bring to mind Sergeant Bilko's hustlers) and a warm, likable cast. Andrews himself, perhaps, has never been better.

{"description": "Carl Reiner directed this sweet comedy about the Man Upstairs visiting Earth in the form of a funny little guy (George Burns). John Denver is the good man chosen to be God's contact in the modern age--and like an Old Testament prophet, Denver's character pays the price by being ridiculed and faced with criminal charges. Denver is a warm presence, but the film is entirely in Burns's court. Reiner feeds him lines that come out of Burns' mouth like stage patter, and it's no wonder he got a huge career boost from this film in the winter of his life. Except for some courtroom stuff in the third act--where Reiner inadvertently cheapens the movie with editing tricks to suggest \"miracles\"--Oh, God!is just fine.

{"description": "This absolutely charming, wholly engaging romantic comedy is the hidden gem of the four collaborations of Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant. Most everyone's seenThe Philadelphia Story, but few know of this unorthodox, hilarious comedy of life among the rich and privileged, though both were Broadway hits by playwright Philip Barry. Grant plays the happy-go-lucky Johnny Case, a self-made man with a dream in his heart of making just enough money to retire on and then traveling around the world. Johnny proposes to the lovely Julia (Doris Nolan) in Lake Placid, but it isn't until he comes to pay her a visit in New York that he discovers she's the daughter of a wealthy industrialist. Although his nonconformity ruffles the feathers of Julia's stuffy father, he's soon won over the whole family--most notably, Julia's rebellious sister Linda (Hepburn), who in becoming Johnny's greatest advocate finds herself irresistibly drawn to him. There's more going on here than a spiffy, surface romance, with Johnny's free-spirit determination going up against rock-hard establishment values, and director George Cukor plays up the social politics of the story just as well as the wonderful, exquisite romance. Hepburn and Grant, as always, are perfectly paired, and given able support by Lew Ayres as the black sheep of Hepburn's family, and Edward Everett Horton and Jean Dixon as Grant's longtime pals. Filmed previously in 1930; Hepburn understudied the role of Linda on Broadway and used a scene from the play in her first screen test.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000040EO", "6302990076", "630150528X", "0792839846", "6302227127", "6304383177", "0782006779", "6302305950", "630310245X", "6302208920", "6303102441", "6301278437", "6304525125", "6302798434", "6301328531", "B000PYKZYC", "6304056958", "6303333079", "6302725542", "0792840836", "B0000049FG", "6302484448", "6301973267", "0790744759", "6301987845", "1559838450", "B006P0UQ2G", "630266232X", "630299005X", "6301964012", "6303364772", "0783215096", "6301670140", "B00005LMA7", "6304111398", "6302011035", "6301798503", "0792837630", "6301967410", "0792837649"], "also_viewed": ["B008D1Q1VU", "B000A8AX6I"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 332020}, "asin": "630290899X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510FZJEFSHL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Holiday [VHS]"}
{"description": "Portly Charles Coburn makes a cute if unlikely cupid in George Stevens's smart 1943 romantic comedy. Jean Arthur is girl next door and big-city sophisticate rolled up in one bubbly package as Connie Milligan, a single woman in Washington D.C.  who sublets a room in her small apartment during the wartime housing crisis. Her new roommate, the deadpan eccentric Mr. Dingle (Coburn, who won an Oscar for his rascally performance), dislikes her stiff, bureaucratic beau and takes it upon himself to find her an appropriate boyfriend, namely the soft-spoken industrial engineer Joe Carter (Joel McCrea), whom Dingle puts up in his half of the apartment. Stevens takes a measured approach to comedy: The first morning with all three in the cramped kitchen turns a painstakingly organized schedule into a chaotic free-for-all that just gets funnier as the anarchy builds. Even more effective is the contrast between the charmingly effusive Arthur and McCrea's sauntering style, which creates not so much sparks as a slow simmer as they continue to spend time together. One of the finest craftsmen of Hollywood's Golden Age, Stevens shapes this lightweight screenplay into one of the most delectable romantic comedies of all time.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783228074", "6302806348", "6301977149", "6301987845", "6303333079", "6301586050", "630266232X", "6301016971", "6300185125", "6302208939", "0800113055", "6301491920", "6300251152", "6303364772", "630290899X", "6301278437", "6301972171", "B00005LMA7", "0782006779", "6301978390", "630021074X"]}, "price": 19.88, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 379348}, "asin": "6302909007", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71MJ094PD3L._SY300_.gif", "title": "The More the Merrier [VHS]"}
{"description": "This sensational, extremely influential, 1974 low-budget horror movie directed by Tobe Hooper (Poltergeist,Lifeforce,Salem's Lot), may be notorious for its title, but it's also a damn fine piece of moviemaking. And it's blood-curdling scary, too. Loosely based on the true crimes of Ed Gein (also a partial inspiration forPsycho), the original Jeffrey Dahmer,Texas Chainsaw Massacrefollows a group of teenagers who pick up a hitchhiker and wind up in a backwoods horror chamber where they're held captive, tortured, chopped up, and impaled on meat hooks by a demented cannibalistic family, including a character known as Leatherface who maniacally wields one helluva chainsaw. The movie's powerful sense of dread is heightened by its grainy, semi-documentary style--but it also has a wicked sense of humor (and not that camp, self-referential variety that became so tiresome in subsequent horror films of the '70s, '80s, and '90s). OK, in case you couldn't tell, it's \"not for everyone.\" But as a landmark in the development of the horror/slasher genre, it ranks withPsycho,Halloween, andA Nightmare on Elm Street.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305095566", "0792839242", "B00023NRSM", "6304983794", "6300214087", "6300267881", "6300214311", "6300214192", "6302038308", "B00000G1XV", "0792846710", "0792836634", "1452114498", "0792839234", "B00A82A7ZS", "B00009W0TZ", "6304240562", "6300214605", "B00018D454", "0790705141", "B00000F6FN", "6300183416", "0783216084", "6302862787", "6300262855", "0780616561", "6300182770", "B0000065MW", "6300214656", "B00079Z9X2", "6301996127", "6300182878", "6304819927", "B00000IQUT", "6304509154", "6302844207", "6301969782", "0783235607", "6301094352", "6302798450", "6303031846", "B00000JQTO", "6300218058", "0783246641", "079284632X", "B0032GEL54", "6303442315", "6304370458", "630026999X", "6300263681", "6300214826", "B00000JLWQ", "630533580X", "6301961404", "0764005707", "B00007L4N7", "6304288433", "6300189015", "6303954278", "B000AMW2TK", "6301589025", "B0053TWVT6", "6302968143", "6302878772", "B0000039A6", "B00005ATQA", "B000006FZ0", "6305939616", "0780627032", "B000A0GOH8", "6303359345", "B00000JQTR"], "also_viewed": ["6300214087", "B00023NRSM", "0792839242", "B00018D454", "B00L22H2IS", "6305095566", "B00LLAV26O", "6300189015", "0792836634", "0800187164", "6301589955", "B000099T3M", "6304819927", "0780616561", "630428845X", "B00IF8Q0YE", "B0000039A6", "B000I2J68M", "6300214605", "B00BM4Q4N0", "6300214311", "6303917461", "6303506291", "630130053X", "B004RE29PO", "6304509154", "B000VKL6Z2", "B00BCMT2BI", "1452114498", "B003UGLCIA", "B00BCMSY80", "B000KJU1KK", "B002YICNE2", "0783235607", "B00C7C00JU", "B00DEQQK8S", "B00000IQUT", "B0057O6IDW", "6304983794", "B005J9ZE5I", "B00G5GNYY2", "B00JHH1VSW", "6300267881", "B002UR4GDI", "B000009NQY", "B001JFZ1UE", "B008CYDDWI", "0783216084", "B003JIPN20", "B009DA743Y", "B00DI012O2", "6301792734", "B002OVO18A", "6300182878", "6302517036", "B00LBFFR2Y"]}, "price": 24.95, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 183169}, "asin": "6302921058", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71DZX9N6ZZL._SY300_.gif", "title": "Texas Chainsaw Massacre [VHS]"}

{"description": "Daniel Auteuil (Manon of the Spring) plays Stephane, the curiously diffident coowner of an exclusive violin brokerage and repair shop. A brilliant technician, Stephane can make any instrument live up to its promise, yet he is emotionally remote himself, disconnected from passionate experience.

When Maxime's new lover, a violinist named Camille (Emmanuelle B&eacute;art), is drawn to Stephane's still waters, the latter is briefly moved, thus destroying the fragile, symbiotic relationship between all three individuals. Veteran French filmmaker Claude Sautet (of the Oscar-winningC&eacute;sar et Rosalie) has made a powerful film here expressed in the smallest of gestures, just as one might tune the strings of a violin ever-so-slightly to achieve perfection. Sautet indeed employs such a sonorous motif in this story, in which violins always seem to be playing and suggesting that the principal characters look at life as they do music: something to be tinkered with and manipulated for effect.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B000053VBP", "B00005NFY4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 352226}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6302973570", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41G45892R9L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Un Coeur En Hiver [VHS]"}

Williams is nowhere to be found, unfortunately; the genie's voice is provided by Dan Castellaneta, and the difference shows.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["6304089201", "6302787068", "0788805533", "6303314015", "0788812408", "6304290888", "6305940932", "6304401132", "B000035Z2S", "0788806270", "6302526574", "6302320402", "6302961572", "0788811002", "155890641X", "0788805843", "6300274195", "B0000E32WB", "6302642248", "0788802194", "6305229449", "6300275310", "0788803743", "B0000524CZ", "6304500831", "6304400551", "6305319138", "6304100507", "6300274268", "6301390725", "078881172X", "6304089767", "6303983812", "6304501153", "B00005T7H6", "6302178924", "0788812807", "6304978286", "B00004R99N", "B00005RDVV", "B00005JL95", "B000JBWWRO", "1558906630", "B00008Y47S", "6301991311", "B00003CXQX", "B00003CX7L", "6303534422", "0788810634", "6303929338", "B0002YLCHE", "B00003CXQ6", "6302158095", "B0007NY3A8", "B00005JKX3", "B000063V8N", "B0000AQZYM", "6301948106", "B00003CXHR", "1558906150", "B00005JKDQ", "B00005T7H1", "6302426200", "B00007AJLB", "B000XUOIQO", "B000009CTR", "6304400225", "6304401736", "B000035Z46", "6305326940", "B00003CWPW", "078880720X", "6304155972", "0788812181", "6303315305", "6303939015", "6300274608", "6302642302", "B00000ICHA", "0788812440", "6304089112", "6304400381", "6303123244", "6303122647", "6305177473", "6302484359", "6303315690", "B000035Z4W", "B00005JMB3", "B000001M24", "B0001I55VK", "B00006G8LB", "B00004R99I", "B000FQISFS", "B00016JF2W", "B00004YRJ5", "B001G2S3X2", "6302968143"], "bought_together": ["6304089201", "6302787068"], "also_viewed": ["6304089201", "6302787068", "6303314015", "0788805533", "6304290888", "6300275310", "155890641X", "6302526574", "078881172X", "0788812408", "B00004R99N", "6304500831", "0788806270", "6304501153", "B0002YLCGK", "6303983812", "0788802194", "6304401132", "0788805843", "6305940932", "B000035Z2S", "6305326940", "6305229449", "6303929338", "6305319138", "6302426200", "6302320402", "0788812807", "6302642248", "6302961572", "6304978286", "B00003CX7L", "B0007KTBIU", "B00005JKX3", "B00005JKDQ", "B0000524CZ", "B0007NY3A8", "B00003CXQX", "6304089767", "6300274195", "B000JBWWRO", "B00005JL95", "6302178924", "B0000AQZYM", "B00GXHR5XE", "6302158095", "6303534422", "B0000E32WB", "B00003CXHR", "B00005RDVV", "6304100507", "B00005T7H6", "B000063V8N", "0788811002", "6304401736", "6301390725", "6301948106", "1558906630", "0788810634"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 88006}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.45, "brand": "Walt Disney Home Video", "asin": "6303036813", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514PYP1K0JL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Return of Jafar [VHS]"}

In the hopes of finding the treasure to buy back their houses, the Goonies embark on their quest through underground passages, aboard pirate ships, and behind waterfalls.

{"description": "Richard Donner's 1978 epic about the Man of Steel showed how a film about a superhero could be a moving and romantic experience even for people who long ago gave up comic books. Beginning on the icy planet Krypton, the story follows the baby Kal-El, whose rocket ship lands in Smallville, Kansas. He is found there by a childless couple and raised as the shy Clark Kent (the young Kent is played by Jeff East). The film is perhaps most touching in these sequences, with expanses of wheat fields blowing in the wind and with a young man who can't figure out what part in destiny his great powers are meant to play. The second half, with Reeve taking over as Clark/Superman, is bustling, enchanting (the scene in which Superman flies girlfriend Lois Lane--played by Margot Kidder--through the night sky is great date material), and funny, thanks largely to Gene Hackman's sardonic portrayal of nemesis Lex Luthor.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300268993", "B000059XYC", "6300270122", "6303020089", "B000059XXZ", "0784011923", "B0002XNSYA", "B00005A1VG", "6303506291", "6301969413", "0800198395", "6302941318", "6304509154", "630196649X", "6304508611", "0790731975", "0790700506", "6300181537", "B000059XY5", "0790733897", "B00000JGEI", "6300214311", "6304047843", "6302238331", "6300214060", "630407185X", "6303148352", "6303212379", "6302510023", "0783216084", "B00004TYS8", "6302380294", "0790744589", "0792133153", "6302091632", "6302098424", "6304143184", "B0000068SI", "B00004RNAC", "6302510031", "630251018X", "6302510015", "B0000CDL3W", "6302510198", "B0001VL30O", "B000006FNX", "6302909023", "B000065U6Q", "6302032377"], "bought_together": ["6300268993", "B000059XYC"], "also_viewed": ["B000IJ79WU", "6300268993", "B000059Z8K", "B000P6XQ50", "B0039208JE", "6300270122", "B000IJ79VQ", "B000059XYC", "B000IJ79X4", "B001DJLD2G", "B000059XXZ", "B00F4FFO8E", "B00005JKCH", "6302642248", "6303953425", "B00005LIRF", "B00EAPMGIU", "B000IJ79XE", "B00BBND56G", "0790734079", "0784011923", "B000VI70QS", "B00005LKLF", "B000059Z8L", "B000UR9T8C", "B00005JXY3", "B0039208QM", "6303506291", "B0016MOWOQ", "B0087F7VSY", "B00000GUNY", "0783222726", "B00DYEN6XC", "B00E5I2MCM", "B0090SI582", "B00JPS6A3O", "B0057R5XRG", "B008JFUO72", "B008JFUS0U"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 202304}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.75, "brand": "", "asin": "6303212263", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51E39PXF9BL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Superman the Movie [VHS]"}

{"description": "Proof, a brilliant allegory about trust, is at once mordantly  funny, chilling, and touching. It keeps us off balance from the beginning, challenging our assumptions about everything from the art of filmmaking to the nature of human relationships. The tone is reminiscent of David Mamet and Harold Pinter, but Australian writer-director Jocelyn Moorhouse has a quirky outlook all her own. Hugo Weaving (later known as the villainous Agent Smith inThe Matrix), plays Martin, a blind  photographer who compulsively shoots photos as proof of the actuality of his  existence. He relies on his spiteful housekeeper, Celia (Genevi&egrave;ve  Picot), to tell him what's in his snapshots. But can he trust her to tell him  the truth? Celia rearranges the furniture so Martin will trip over it. Why?  Because she's in love with him. But Martin won't let her into his heart; he's  never been able to trust anyone. Into this quagmire of mutual torment walks  Andrew, a regular guy personified, to become the first real friend Martin has  ever had. At this point the picture jumps up a notch, for Andrew is played by  hunky, appealing young Russell Crowe, whose emotional range and star quality are already unmistakable. Just when we think thatProofhas devolved into yet another feel-good buddy picture, the ground shifts again beneath our feet.

{"description": "Spike Lee made a splash in the independent film world with his debut feature, an inventive low-budget romance with a strong-willed heroine. Nola Darling (Tracy Camilla Johns) can't decide among her three boyfriends: serious but sweet Jamie (Tommy Redmond Hicks), self-centered clotheshorse Greer (John Canada Terrell), and goofy, wisecracking bike messenger Mars Blackmon (Lee). Within this loose story line Lee launches into a character study of Darling and offers a slice of black urban life rarely seen on the screen. According to Lee's published diary, he interviewed dozens of women and gathered feedback on screenplay from female friends, and his efforts show. Nola is an unapologetic, sexually independent character who resists the efforts of the men in her life to change who she is to please them--the wonderful concluding twist thumbs its nose at romantic conventions and gives  Nola her due. Lee combines direct address and documentary techniques with a simple, often elegant narrative style to create a multilayered portrait of Nola and her men and question perceptions and conventions of sex, sexuality, and relationships in the modern world. Though somewhat primitive in the light of his more accomplished works, this first feature introduces Lee as a fresh voice and a creative force to be reckoned with.--Sean Axmaker", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 469316}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6303832571", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51FBCVX54SL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "She's Gotta Have It [VHS]"}
{"description": "\"I've got that nice, tired old feeling,\" says Pa Frake near the end of the gentle, sunny 1945 film, State Fair. The Rodgers and Hammerstein music, commissioned while Oklahoma was still making musical-theater history, feels tired too, like the result of a hastily written score. The state of Iowa just can't seem to inspire the same quality music as its more memorable, southern cousin. Remember that State Fair gem \"All I Owe Iowa\"? Still, it is R and H, and \"It Might as Well Be Spring\" is here as well as some other decent ditties. There's a country-mouse feeling as the Frake family journeys to the big city for the annual harvest celebration. Young daughter Margy (Jeanne Crain) has her eye on something more exciting than her bore of a fianc, while her brother meets a lovely big-band singer with a secret. But the bucolic, Old Farmer's Almanac feel is genuine, and it's most obviously a picture of a bygone era when someone expostulates gleefully, \"You're gonna be the wife of a journalist!\" Not a \"don't miss\" but not a dismiss either.", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305282927", "B00004TRD5", "6303494390", "B00000F6D1", "6303444202", "6302363268", "6304178352", "6304117752", "0792837533", "6304151306", "0790744759", "630233683X", "6300246787", "0792837614", "630197736X", "6300215695", "6305123616", "0792837630", "0792840836", "B00004ZDXK", "080013558X", "B0007Z0O9U", "0792839846", "B001PO550A", "6302842263", "6302136237", "B000HT3PGU", "6302314631", "0783221347", "0792107683", "B0000040EJ", "6304331851", "0783235593", "B00004RV8M", "630150528X", "6300183513", "6300147983", "6302962048", "B0009J2F1E", "6302593220", "B00004TZS4", "6303103618", "6301971647", "6304285388", "B00005ASSD", "630310374X", "0792840844"], "bought_together": ["6303494390", "6305282927"], "also_viewed": ["B00004TRD5", "0790744759", "B000HT3PGU", "080013558X", "B005QCJ7GU", "6300246787", "630106660X", "6305282927", "6300215695", "6303444202", "0792837614", "6304117752", "6302426200", "155890641X", "6302091632"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 274003}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6303854311", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51XZJ8SGPCL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "State Fair [VHS]"}

{"description": "Ken Burns's film on \"the closest thing to a National Temple\" is a brief and vital history of the United States Congress--the building and the institution. While the executive wing receives most of history's ink, the legislative branch has a more varied and colorful story. Starting with golden-tongued orators Henry Clay and Daniel Webster, the representatives were an eccentric lot, often pushing the limits of democracy with the power they wielded. Burns's formula of interviews, actors' readings, and wonderful photographs continue in this production although it's more streamlined. Covering 200 years in 90 minutes (the video version is slightly longer than the TV airing) is a tough job and we only stay a minute or two with key characters, many of whom you've never heard of. Burns may have bitten off more then he could chew with the vast history--much of it dealing with the slavery issue--but that was solved with his next project: his 11-hour masterpiece,The Civil War.--Doug Thomas", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 619746}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.97, "brand": "", "asin": "6304048661", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51WDPDRHMVL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Congress [VHS]"}

{"description": "Anthony Mann was a poverty-row director with ambition when he transformed this story of undercover Treasury agents (based on a collection of true cases) into a moody, alienated drama about two lawmen living a shadowed life in the underworld where a blown cover means death. Square-jawed Dennis O'Keefe, a former leading man turned beefy B movie tough guy, and Alfred Ryder star as the titular T-men who take over a counterfeiting investigation when their predecessor is killed, posing as street thugs to infiltrate their way into the gang and living the dangerous life of the gangster to the hilt. The documentary-style realism, with its authoritative narrator, location shooting, and stock-shot interludes of shuffling papers and laboratory testing, is given a nightmarish dimension with stark sets lit in claustrophobic shadows, creating an abstract, eerie emptiness. Penned by John C. Higgins (who wrote Mann's previous film,Railroaded!), and shot by the brilliant cinematographer John Alton,T-Menis raw in comparison to the smoother, more handsome studio noirs such asThe Maltese FalconandOut of the Past. Saddled with often awkward dialogue and hackneyed narration, this low-budget gem derives its power from the brutal violence (often offscreen but no less unsettling for it) and spare style, and the desperation in the hard faces of the unglamorous actors. Mann, Alton, Higgins, and star O'Keefe reteamed for the moodyRaw Dealthe next year.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["630196697X", "B003G9IT3C"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 560676}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 26.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6304239343", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31HWTAQYRNL.gif", "title": "T-Men [VHS]"}

{"description": "Disney's 1959 animated effort was the studio's most ambitious to date, a widescreen spectacle boasting a gorgeous waltz-filled score adapting Tchaikovsky. In the 14th century, the malevolent Maleficent (not dissimilar to the wicked Queen in Disney'sSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs) taunts a king that his infant Aurora will fatally prick her finger on a spinning wheel before sundown on her 16th birthday. This, of course, would deny her a happily-ever-after with her true love. Things almost but not quite turn out that way, thanks to the assistance of some bubbly, bumbling fairies named Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather. It's not really all that much about the title character--how interesting can someone in the middle of a long nap be, anyway? Instead, those fairies carry the day, as well as, of course, good Prince Phillip, whose battle with the malevolent Maleficent in the guise of a dragon has been co-opted by any number of animated films since.

{"description": "Political heavyweights decide that Jefferson Smith (James Stewart), an obscure scoutmaster in a small town, would be the perfect dupe to fill a vacant U.S. Senate chair. Surely this naive bumpkin can be easily controlled by the senior senator (Claude Rains) from his state, a respectable and corrupted career politician. Director Frank Capra fills the movie with Smith's wide-eyed wonder at the glories of Washington, all of which ring false for his cynical secretary (Jean Arthur), who doesn't believe for a minute this rube could be for real. But he is. Capra was repeating the formula of a previous film,Mr. Deeds Goes to Town, but this one is even sharper; Stewart and Arthur are brilliant, and the former cowboy star Harry Carey lends a warm presence to the role of the vice president. Bright, funny, and beautifully paced,Mr. Smith Goes to Washingtonis Capra's ode to the power of innocence--an idea so potent that present-day audiences may find themselves wishing for a new Mr. Smith in Congress. The 1939 Congress was none too thrilled about the film's depiction of their august body, denouncing it as a caricature; but even today, Capra's jibes about vested interests and political machines look as accurate as ever.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B006FE83UE", "B0000049FG", "B00AEBB89C", "B002VWNIAY", "B001D8W7EU", "0800113047", "6303215734", "B0045HCJQW", "B0000JBALO", "0783222955", "B00000F13T", "6300181472", "1558807780", "6300181111", "6305282927"], "bought_together": ["B006FE83UE"], "also_viewed": ["B006FE83UE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 430231}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.67, "brand": "", "asin": "6304481691", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51K2W1W387L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Mr Smith Goes to Washington [VHS]"}

Val Kilmer plays Simon Templar, the mercenary spy, who is hired to steal a fusion formula but falls in love with the scientist (Elisabeth Shue) who cooked it up.

{"description": "\"If this picture doesn't make you scream and squirm, you should see a psychiatrist--quick!\" shouts the film's trailer. This time the hyperbole is right. David Cronenberg's debut feature, and Canada's first domestic horror film, is an ingeniously engineered slasher of thoroughly modern horror that, like George Romero'sNight of the Living Dead, charts a social breakdown by tearing through our most intrinsic taboos. A genetically engineered designer parasite--part aphrodisiac, part venereal disease--created by a modern-day mad scientist escapes into a colorless, self-contained apartment complex and goes searching for hosts. This monstrous parasite multiplies and invades the alienated occupants, turning them into a pack of id-driven sex maniacs. Cronenberg's suffocating vision of modern life turns his budgetary limitations--dreary, bland sets, flat lighting, and numb performances--into a severe portrait of society out of touch with its physical and emotional existence. Cronenberg pushed the boundaries of gore in 1974, but more insidious is the way he pushes the boundaries of behavior: under the influence of this invasive disease, families turn to incest and murder, strangers sexually assault the helpless, and finally they band together as a pack of bloodthirsty, libido-driven animals. That taboo-breaking display still has the power to get under your skin. The film has also been released under the titlesThe Parasite MurdersandThey Came from Within.

Treat Williams plays the leader of a mercenary crew whose members discover the ravaged ship and wage war on the creature; Famke Janssen joins him as an onboard thief and con artist who just happens to be highly skilled with automatic weapons. Of course, the action grows more intense as the body count rises and along the way the monster is gradually revealed in all of its gruesome glory.

They're all part of Mel Brooks's wild and wacky first film, THE PRODUCERS. In this hysterical farce, rapacious but lovable producer Max Bialystock (Zero Mostel) hasn't had a hit in years and resorts to fulfilling sexually crazed little old ladies' fantasies for extra cash. But when he meets his new meek, neurotic accountant, Leo Bloom (Gene Wilder), the two accidentally come up with a plot to oversell shares in a surefire flop musical and make off with the profits. The plan sends the new partners-in-crime on a search for the worst play ever: SPRINGTIME FOR HITLER, written by an ex-Nazi (Kenneth Mars) whose only friends are the filthy city pigeons he keeps on his roof. Inspired, manic performances by all involved, along with Brooks's lively direction--which affectionately alludes to such MGM Golden Age musicals as SINGIN' IN THE RAIN--make THE PRODUCERS both referential and highly original as it moves along swiftly to the ultimate musical climax.", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301797973", "630281622X", "6305576173", "6300247112"], "bought_together": ["6301797973"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 552537}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 15.0, "brand": "", "asin": "6305112878", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/215KFPD56ZL.jpg", "title": "Producers [VHS]"}

A handful of strangers wake up inside a bizarre maze, having been spirited there during the night. They quickly learn that they have to navigate their way through a series of chambers if they have any hope of escape, but the problem is that there are lethal traps awaiting if they choose their route unwisely. Having established some imaginative and grisly punishments in store for the hostages, cowriter and director Vincenzo Natali turns his attention to the characters, for whom being trapped amplifies their best and worst qualities. The film is, in fact, similar to a famous episode of Rod Serling's old television series, though Natali's explanation for why these poor people are being put through hell is a lot closer to the spirit ofThe X-Files.Cubehas some solid moments of suspense and drama, and the sets are appropriately striking: one is tempted to believe at first the characters are lost inside a computer chip.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00008DDVY", "B0006Z2LH4", "B003TRMLQM", "078401213X", "B0040QYRSQ", "B00003CXKM", "B0045HCJSU", "B002TVQ4HG", "B00AEFXW8I", "0783228457", "B000CGX7FW", "B002C6VMKW", "B0051GLDQS", "B007AFC0RY", "B00006AUIG", "B0001US62I", "B00000K3TS", "B00ECW9UJY", "B000AQKV1W", "6305622760", "6305972001", "B00IXD2MWK", "B002QW7ALM", "B000A2X3U2", "B001J4E19C", "B0053TWVIM", "B002EOVXEC", "B0019BI1DM", "B0018O4YT0", "B0056P6SOG", "B0000541TL", "B00006IUFV", "B00BTYOYG2", "B00IKM5MIA", "B008874968", "B004EPZ08O", "B0028DRGDQ", "B003Y5H4SO", "B000MV8ABS", "B00009PY2T", "079073639X", "B004SIP92O", "B002AMVEII", "B00001QGUM", "B00GKOJ98E", "B0007WQHI0", "B00J5LXT6M", "B00008EY9G", "B00003CXUP", "B003EYVXSW", "B00005UQ9W", "B000Y7U98C", "B009DA743Y", "B002E2QH7W", "B000UJ48P4", "B000MNOXZ8", "B00DI012O2", "B009IV2Z3M", "B002TZS5G0", "B001FOPOD8", "B0001EFV7M", "157362618X", "B003Q6D246", "0783116926", "B000A6T1ZY", "B0091G7BTM", "B00000F5WY", "B00009WNXA", "6305718954", "B000OA8OK4", "B004SUDQ72", "B003TRMLM6", "B003VMFWXO", "B002ZG98LO", "B0004Z31OS", "B00JQYV0B4", "B0002CHIKG", "B0009MWELW", "B00006CXGP", "B001MEJY8W", "B008G33PIM", "B00A1AU74I", "B008Y1YK7G", "0767824954", "B0034G4OVS", "B003Q6D27S", "B000AM6OQ2", "B0009G3B0G", "B009XTF8KQ", "B00079Z9X2", "B000RPCK2O", "B000UAE7O0", "B00EZ50SGW", "B000069HZP", "B000I2J68M", "B0037E8HNI", "B000ARFPMQ", "B00BSU0FQA", "B008JFUNYG"], "bought_together": ["B00008DDVY", "B0006Z2LH4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003TRMLQM", "078401213X", "B00008DDVY", "B002EOVXEC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 14077}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.88, "brand": "Trimark Home Video", "asin": "6305238065", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51AJV2DZ45L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Cube"}

Trying to get work in 1930s Hollywood wasn't easy for such a rabid anti-Communist, but Rand persisted and the tales of her life in the theater, her lifelong relationship with actor Frank O'Connor, and her midlife career change from novelist to political philosopher are both inspiring and dramatic, just as she'd want them to be.--Rob Lightner", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 535375}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.01, "brand": "", "asin": "630529285X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41FKQMGEHYL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Ayn Rand: A Sense of Life [VHS]"}

{"description": "You might have heard people say they'd kill to get into Harvard. Well, here's a film that takes it literally.  There's a legendary rule at many universities, so the film posits, that if your roommate commits suicide you can take a 4.0&nbsp;GPA for the semester.  Tim (Matthew Lillard ofScreamfame, in yet another of his patented psycho roles) plans with his roommate Chris (Michael Vartan) to kill a third roommate Rand (Randall Batinkoff) so they can collect their 4.0s and get Chris a Harvard M.B.A.  As Chris says, \"Either it's a Harvard M.B.A. or you're flipping burgers.\"  No elevated thinker, Chris.  Rand is a cruel jerk to his Sandy Dennis-like girlfriend, Natalie (Tamara Craig Thomas), so it's hard to miss him when he's gone.  But that sentiment applies equally to nearly every other character in the picture, including Chris's girlfriend Emma (Keri Russell), who seems to be the most sympathetic of the group.  That's the movie's strength; you think you know everyone but you don't.  And that's also its greatest weakness; you need to know and like these people for the film to work.  If you can stomach these people (in which case counseling might be in order), the exceedingly twisty-turny plot  will keep you entertained to the last amazing revelation.  Otherwise, you might want to keep searching for a thriller that gives its people an inner life worth viewing.The Curvewas snatched from Sundance for a distribution deal by Trimark, but wound up in this direct-to-video release instead.--Jim Gay", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792840127", "0767824954", "0767837398", "B000F5WR4W", "B007XF0W3K", "B00003CXUP", "B004P7CN7W", "B00344EAN2", "B00005O5AX", "B00005JKJJ", "B000KHYN9C", "B002GHHHL0", "B00AEBB8QK", "B00BNWWVFG", "B002CVQAX6", "B0053TWVQE", "B000NJMJHK", "0783226845", "B00DNF1R74", "B000A0GP0Y", "B00A47BT7C", "B00BNWWUDY", "B00BDZV8ZM", "B00004YA67", "B000MV8ABS", "B009AMAJPA", "B000FFJZO2", "B00441GYVA", "0790736411", "B002LMSWN2", "B00013RC7K", "B0002WT4OE", "B000PAAJVU", "B004SUDQ1I", "6305065551", "B001URA5Y8", "B00005KAQP", "B00003CXKM", "B000WMFZK6", "B00BCMT2BI", "0792846443", "B000ASATZ8", "B00005UQ9W", "B000053VB2", "B00979KQD6", "B000CPH9PM", "6304711891", "B00006ZXSL", "B002ZG983M", "1573625779", "B0006N2EZ0", "B00AEFXT1S", "B00003CXPS", "B004HZY8OS", "B00004ZESE"], "bought_together": ["0767824954", "B004P7CN7W"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B009POCG2C", "0767824954"]}, "price": 5.96, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 71766}, "asin": "6305375577", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51SW1SWSGEL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Curve"}

{"description": "Robert Clayton Dean (Will Smith) is a lawyer with a wife and family whose happily normal life is turned upside down after a chance meeting with a college buddy (Jason Lee) at a lingerie shop. Unbeknownst to the lawyer, he's just been burdened with a videotape of a congressman's assassination. Hot on the tail of this tape is a ruthless group of National Security Agents commanded by a belligerently ambitious fed named Reynolds (Jon Voight). Using surveillance from satellites, bugs, and other sophisticated snooping devices, the NSA infiltrates every facet of Dean's existence, tracing each physical and digital footprint he leaves. Driven by acute paranoia, Dean enlists the help of a clandestine former NSA operative named Brill (Gene Hackman), andEnemy of the Statekicks into high-intensity hyperdrive.Teaming up once again with producer Jerry Bruckheimer,Top Gundirector Tony Scott demonstrates his glossy style with clever cinematography and breakneck pacing. Will Smith proves that there's more to his success than a brash sense of humor, giving a versatile performance that plausibly illustrates a man cracking under the strain of paranoid turmoil. Hackman steals the show by essentially reprising his role fromThe Conversation--just imagine his memorable character Harry Caul some 20 years later. Most of all, the film's depiction of high-tech surveillance is highly convincing and dramatically compelling, making this a cautionary tale with more substance than you'd normally expect from a Scott-Bruckheimer action extravaganza.--Jeremy Storey", "related": {"also_bought": ["0790732149", "B002AS464Q", "B002AT8K9W", "B000JYW5BE", "6304765258", "B00AEFXYJA", "B001NY4WYC", "B002NZK5UU", "B00008G8M4", "B00AEFXT1S", "B000NTMA0Q", "B0045HCJFS", "B002AT8KA6", "0790736411", "0783226888", "6304806434", "B00015YVDG", "6304711891", "B000CEV3M8", "B00005JN0T", "B00000G3PA", "B003ASLJIQ", "B005LAIGRS", "B001L57ZYM", "B00005JKMQ", "B000OT6V0K", "B00005ATZT", "B0007KIFGE", "B000055Y0Y", "B000QUCRB4", "B00096S49Y", "0767803434", "B004IK30MI", "B00AEFYW64", "B000B8GT92", "B00005JL78", "B000ENC5YW", "B00005UQ9T", "B001B3LIOC", "B002NZK5R8", "B000VG66XS", "B00008OE4W", "B000EGDB10", "B00008K76U", "B00003CXFV", "6304884400", "B000GFLKF8", "B00AEBB8LA", "B00AEFXIIW", "B002NZK5VO", "B00008K76W", "B002GOAH1A", "B00BTYOYG2", "B002GHHHME", "B00014NEZI", "0783240295", "B000P5FH3K", "B003O7I6SE", "B00005JPD0", "B007FQXEWI", "B004EPYZP8", "B00005JA9F", "B000035P5V", "B002DU39GW", "B003BV8I3Q", "0783232098", "B00AEBB86U", "6305428506", "B001TODCII", "B00003CXGV", "0780618548", "B002AT8KAG", "B00AP2DC94", "B00AEFXBG6", "B00026ZG10", "B00BEIYN9Q", "B0006GANOQ", "B000E0WJLE", "B00441GYXI", "B00005B6JZ", "B00A2H9P98", "B00004ZBVG", "B003A12WBQ", "B00011CZRE", "B0013J55B6", "B00AEFYUQQ", "0792844874", "B00006HAWN", "0792159659", "B00AEBB9UK", "0790730979", "B00009WVSL", "B002O3Z4ZW", "B000059TFO", "B0045HCJ8K", "B00006JDVT", "0783225733", "B000E5KURY", "B00029RT9E", "B000TGJ8CQ"], "bought_together": ["B002AS464Q"], "buy_after_viewing": ["6304765258", "B00008G8M4", "B005LAIGRS", "B003ASLJIQ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 3843}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.99, "brand": "Buena Vista", "asin": "6305428115", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51QR8SZKK7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Enemy of the State"}

{"description": "There's Something About Maryis one of the funniest movies in years, recalling the days of the Zucker-Abraham-Zucker movies, in which (often tasteless) gags were piled on at a fierce rate. The difference is that cowriters and codirectors Bobby and Peter Farrelly have also crafted a credible story line and even tossed in some genuine emotional content.The Farrelly brothers' first two movies,Dumb and DumberandKingpin, had some moments of uproarious raunch, but were uneven. WithMary, they've created a consistently hilarious romantic comedy, made all the funnier by the fact that you know that they know that some of their gags go way over the line.Cameron Diaz stars as Mary, every guy's ideal. Ben Stiller plays a high-school suitor still hung up on Mary years later; the obstacles standing between him and her include a number of psychotic suitors, a miserable little pooch, and, oh yeah, a murder charge.The Farrellys' admittedly simplistic camera work, which adapts easily to a TV screen, and the fact that you'll likely laugh yourself so silly over certain scenes you'll want to replay them to see what you were missing while you were busy convulsing, make this a perfect video movie.--David Kronke", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300214567"], "also_viewed": ["B00004YZEG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 467528}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 0.01, "brand": "", "asin": "6305499071", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41T5QB162RL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "There's Something About Mary (Special Edition) [VHS]"}

{"description": "This remake of Neil Simon's 1970 comedy finds Goldie Hawn and Steve Martin as Ohio yokels cast adrift in Rudy Giuliani's sanitized New York City. With their son recently departed for Britain, the empty-nesters travel to the Big Apple for a job interview and are beset with all kinds of bad luck, starting with their flight being rerouted to Boston. Things only go downhill from there, of course, as they're mugged by an Andrew Lloyd Webber imposter, the high-tech multilingual navigation system on their rented Cadillac goes haywire, and their hotel reservations fall through. Though this movie is marred by some out-of-place slapstick and mawkish romance scenes, it's not without its funny moments. The couple stumbles into a sexual-addiction encounter group and has to try to back out gracefully (not succeeding very well, of course). John Cleese is howlingly funny as he reprises hisFawlty Towersrole of a cross-dressing hotelier, and Martin has a great drug-delirium scene, in which he's slipped a hit of LSD in jail (thinking it's aspirin). Just try not to think in terms of comparisons to Neil Simon's original and this remake works fairly well.--Jerry Renshaw", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302579449", "6304112262"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 414914}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.98, "brand": "", "asin": "6305526052", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51CZJRP6H4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Out of Towners [VHS]"}
{"description": "Sean Connery plays a master thief thought to be long retired, while Catherine Zeta-Jones is his foil, a hotshot insurance investigator assigned to his case. They both have a little something to hold over each other's heads, until it turns out that Zeta-Jones is a professional art thief herself and is playing on both sides of the fence. At first they eye each other with mutual distrust until they team up for a job, which goes off without a hitch. Inevitably their prickly relationship begins to thaw somewhat, and the two become attracted to each other as they plan out the massive Y2K bank scam that is the movie's climax (complete with sequel-ready ending).Entrapmentplays somewhat like a '70s caper movie revamped for the gadget-happy high-tech '90s. The plot takes a few too many labored twists and turns, and the chemistry between the two leads is nearly nonexistent, though both carry on gamely in their parts. On the other hand, there is some genuine suspense in many scenes as they go about their business, dripping with whiz-bang burglary devices. Zeta-Jones, of course, is drop-dead gorgeous, and Connery is as reliable as always in his role. The fairly flat editing and direction tends to drag the film down somewhat, but fans of caper movies, high-tech thrillers, and the two leads should find plenty to like in this film.--Jerry Renshaw", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00006IUNT", "6304925131", "079212569X", "0792133153", "0792116887", "B0000048TX", "6303696813", "0790731975", "6303313345", "6304258984", "0783223218", "0800125762", "B00004WIDB", "B00000IO4G", "0783216084", "6303020089", "0790748169", "6300183211"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 212089}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6305622825", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/7179VDAPNGL._SY300_.gif", "title": "Entrapment [VHS]"}

{"description": "A faceless figure marches down an endless hallway as dark, driving music underscores his doom. It's stocky, stalwart Edmond O'Brien, who plows through the police detective's office like he's got nothing to lose. \"I want to report a murder,\" he demands, grim and sleepy-eyed. Who was killed? \"I was.\" It's a brilliant opening to a memorable film noir classic. O'Brien is a CPA who flees his dull job and small California town for a wild weekend in San Francisco, only to be poisoned and doomed to certain death. With only days to live, his incredulity morphs into a searing drive to find his killers and stinging regrets for what might have been. O'Brien is a familiar noir face, but he usually plays figures of authority: a cop inWhite Heat; an investigator inThe Killers. He's a little stiff here, but his blunt, unglamorous persona is perfect for the Everyman who is randomly visited by death. Rudolph Mat&eacute;, a  cinematographer turned director, moves from sun-bright day scenes to busy nighttime locations with few visual flourishes, but when he takes the camera into the streets of Los Angeles and San Francisco the film is energized with a gritty, restless vigor. It's one of the most relentlessly dark films noir ever made--taut, edgy, and low budget. Watch for the Bradbury building in the film's climax, made famous by its memorable use decades later in the sci-fi noir classicBlade Runner.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00004W19C", "B00023P4GA", "B0087ZG7OI", "B00004XPPK", "B00005RDRL", "B00LPUO24Y", "B000B8380A", "B000244EYW", "B004C2523M", "B00023P4II", "B000B8384Q", "B00E18QKJ2", "B00008G8WL", "B00EL6A7XE", "B00007ELDG", "B00006II5J", "B00DBE97S8", "B000B83846", "6305999872", "B00005AUK9", "B00AEBBA7W", "B0009X7678", "B0006Z2NE0", "B0006UEVV8", "B000EXDSBQ", "B009X919UE", "B001CC7PM6", "B0080JG2GE", "B00007ELD1", "B00FPUN21O", "B00K6D1S7A", "B000244EX8", "B008BSM1CI", "B0000CNY4Z", "B0007ZEO8C", "B00AQ6J5YA", "B000087F79", "B000CNE088", "B00004W229", "B000244EWO", "B000BGH2NG", "B0006UEVVS", "B00E18QK9W", "B000PKG6OE", "B0009X7682", "B00097DY0M", "B00005Y70U", "B000EXDSBG", "B0089LT7ZG", "B000PMFRVU", "B000LN6UHI", "B00074DY0M", "B004CZZZUY", "B00AEFXRWO", "B00I9BU60Q", "B000M2E3GI", "B0024FAG80", "B00JX3SIE0", "B000KJTGFG", "B000FFJYAC", "B00I9BU3M2", "B0024FAG8A", "B004I1K05W", "B000RXVND8", "B00012L786", "B00008LDNZ", "B00KIZY3XW", "B002YNQEFG", "B00K6D1QV8", "B007Y1NNAW", "B0007ZEO7S", "B00CVB6XF2", "B005152C9G", "B00457ZNS8", "B00JX3SHIC", "B00IGK6T9W", "B00008L3U3", "B00004RER5", "B004VA0R7Q", "B00JXVNVRG", "B00023P4FQ", "B00005AUKD", "B002945DUM", "B0006HBV3C", "B00I3C1T34", "B000JLTREK", "B00ICWO1LC", "B00AEBB89C", "B00DZP1C9K", "B001CC7PLW", "B0026ZQJT8", "B0089LT800", "B00EL6A9CI", "B000244EWY", "B0008ENIAC", "B000FFJYA2", "B000CNE08I", "B006GVNHMA", "B001SMC9L2", "B000FTCLQW"], "bought_together": ["B00004W19C", "B00023P4GA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00023P4GA", "B0087ZG7OI", "B00023P4FQ", "B00AEBB89C"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 123587}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.96, "brand": "Image Entertainment", "asin": "6305770328", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51MoNhyDDzL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "D.O.A."}

{"description": "Noted for intimate character studies created in collaboration with his actors, director Mike Leigh makes a dramatic change of pace with this biography of comic opera composers W.S. Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan. Gilbert (Jim Broadbent) is an easily angered but otherwise emotionally remote lyricist who works in collaboration with composer Sullivan (Alan Corduner), a genial and fun-loving sort who feels unsatisfied writing light operettas and longs to work with more serious material. While Sullivan is having a creative crisis, Gilbert is facing a failing marriage to Lucy (Lesley Manville), who loves her husband even if he can't return her affections, and must deal with his ailing father (Charles Simon). When they suffer their first failure, both men are depressed, and Sullivan announces that he's giving up operetta for good. However, a visit to an exhibit of Japanese art sparks an idea in Gilbert, and soon he and Sullivan are hard at work on what will become one of their greatest successes, The Mikado. Much of the film is devoted to the staging of this classic, with Shirley Henderson, Dorothy Atkinson, Martin Savage, Timothy Spall, and Kevin McKidd as members of the operetta's cast. Jim Broadbent won Best Actor at the 1999 Venice Film Festival. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi\n\nR, 2 hr. 40 min.\nDrama, Musical & Performing Arts, Art House & International, Comedy\nDirected By: Mike Leigh\nWritten By: Mike Leigh\nIn Theaters: Dec 17, 1999 Limited", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 373514}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.41, "brand": "", "asin": "6305882010", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Q6RXY94VL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Topsy Turvy [VHS]"}

{"description": "Fritz Lang's all-but-unseen final film, a low-budget German thriller that resurrects (sort of) his legendary underworld genius Dr. Mabuse, is a flashback to Lang's early days of criminal conspiracies and wild, fast-paced adventures. A relentless police inspector (GertGoldfingerFr&ouml;be) targets the Nazi-built Hotel Luxor as the central connection in over a dozen murders and camps out in the lobby. Upstairs an American industrialist (played by the very German Peter Van Eyck) rescues a suicidal woman (Dawn Addams) from the ledge and falls in love, while in the basement a mysterious, club-footed character watches everything on an elaborate closed-circuit surveillance system. Rounding out the cast of shady characters are a jovial but nosy insurance salesman, a creepy blind psychic, and a particularly menacing Howard Vernon as an icy assassin with a silent rifle. The complicated, at times confusing plot is secondary to the web of blackmail, murder, secret identities, and incessant surveillance at the center of the conspiracy: everyone is spying on somebody and almost no one is as he or she seems. The generic sets and frankly cheep special effects are made up for with ingenious cinematic signatures (the opening assassination is a model of cool simplicity and striking suggestion), dark humor, a rich cast of vivid characters, and a driving pace that sends the film hurtling headlong toward a fatal climax.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0001UZZS6", "B000FS9FLW", "B00004Z4VE", "B0007TKNHY", "B002MZZTL6", "6305908311", "B00064AEWY", "B0058OTM4S", "B004I3Z6G8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000FS9FLW", "B002MZZUGK", "B0001UZZS6", "B0007TKNHY"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 368577}, "asin": "630590796X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/211AMP4V2CL.jpg", "title": "The 1,000 Eyes of Dr. Mabuse"}

{"description": "Here's a movie that should convince anyone that law school is not for them--particularly Harvard Law School. Timothy Bottoms leads a group of would-be shysters through their first year at Harvard--which amounts to endless studying and backbiting as they try to memorize whole books at a sitting. As the grueling routine begins to get to them, each reacts to the stress in different way. Bottoms's character becomes consumed with winning the attention and approval of the school's crankiest teacher, the crusty Prof. Kingsfield, the role that won \"newcomer\" John Houseman an Oscar. Alternately funny and harrowing, it makes law school look like the academic equivalent of coal mining.--Marshall Fine", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B001O4KBMI", "B002NS5HPA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 303116}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.0, "brand": "", "asin": "B000005QHG", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51JVEPBE6EL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Paper Chase [VHS]"}

{"description": "Sudden Fearis one of those noir gems about a love-hate relationship  between a husband and wife that's doomed from the very beginning. Jack Palance plays an ambitious actor rebuffed by playwright and heiress Joan Crawford. He later romances and marries her before falling under the dark spell of ex-girlfriend Gloria Grahame. When Palance and Grahame plot to get her fortune, the evil scheme backfires with ironically twisted results. Palance has no idea how much his wife truly loves him, and she has no idea how sinister he truly is. It's a fascinating if contrived film, with wonderful nuances and sensitive performances by the three leads.--Bill Desowitz", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AG6NO7O", "B0010KHOSK", "B000XNZ7NO", "B00005RDRP", "B0007PALUM", "B0008ENID4", "B00C3ALM02", "B0008ENICA", "B00466JALY", "B005IX3C6S", "B00266UX6W", "B00DSAUKKY", "B00AEBBA7W", "B000EXDSBG", "B00HLT0YNG", "B000B8384Q", "B0008ENI84", "B006X0ZN3K", "B00A9ZMNE2", "B004RA5AU4", "B0079R1KVA", "B0089LT7ZG", "B00KIZY2QA", "B00011D1MC", "B002EAYE9W", "B0087ZG7OI", "B00269OW66", "B000CNE088", "B0082LUEFA", "B004H83IFU", "B0007ZEO8C", "B00J2TCHP6", "B00276T2KO", "B0008ENI98", "B00005RDRL", "B00EKGX2P0", "B000EXDSBQ", "B0009X7682", "B0012KSUUE", "B0009NZ2MO", "B005OT82ZC", "B00AQ6J5YA", "B005HOEBZO", "B00H8J2NTC", "B00I04SVV8", "B000F7CMPO", "B00027JYLM", "B00KIZY3XW", "B003B3O5GI", "B00AEFXRWO", "B000XT1P48", "B000062XG3", "B008BFSMBA", "B000RXVND8", "B001CC7PM6", "B00023P4FQ", "B005UZNC7I", "B00170DEAA", "B0008ENIDO", "B0009S4IKQ", "B0026RCJHM", "B00066FAOE", "B0024FAG80", "B00JXVNVRG", "B002BZR8YI", "B0012OX7DA", "B0089LT800", "B003V4JU1W", "B00023P4GA", "B000B8380A", "B005H8G78O", "B0008ENIAC", "B00JX3SHIC", "B0024FAG8A", "B00074DY0M", "B00CVB6XF2", "B00004W229", "B001709O9A", "B000B83846", "B00DZP1C9K", "B002EAYE6A", "B009X919UE", "B00D09AXUA", "B0082LUGPI", "6305999872", "B008ALNQDY", "B000CCW2SY", "B0026IF1BC", "B008D19ZPY", "B0000CNY2I", "B00AEFYNG8", "1613745796", "B002YNQEFG", "B000FKO3VM", "B006WQUGI2", "B0079R1MA4", "B00023P4II", "068804798X", "B006TXDNEW", "B00012L786"], "bought_together": ["B00AG6NO7O", "B0007PALUM"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0008ENICA", "B0008ENIAC", "B00HLT0YNG", "B0008ENID4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 22590}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 24.64, "brand": "Kino International", "asin": "B00000IPHP", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ERMW26QCL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Sudden Fear"}

Discouraged, the gang leaves New York and goes its separate ways while Kermit, his dream still alive, continues the search for a producer. With the help of a pack of rats who cook at a diner, Kermit signs up an enthusiastic producer and calls his friends back to New York. But when Kermit disappears before the musical opens, the rest of the Muppets must decide whether the show must go on.

{"description": "Disenchanted with the daily drudge of crushing rocks on a prison farm in Mississippi, the dapper, silver-tongued Ulysses Everett McGill (George Clooney, THE PERFECT STORM) busts loose. Except he's still shackled to his own chain-mates from the chain gang -- bad-tempered Pete (John Turturro, SUMMER OF SAM), and sweet, dimwitted Delmar (Tim Blake Nelson, HAMLET). With nothing to lose and buried loot to regain -- before it's lost forever in a flood -- the three embark on the adventure of a lifetime in this hilarious offbeat road picture. Populated with strange characters, including a blind prophet, sexy sirens, and a one-eyed Bible salesman (John Goodman, COYOTE UGLY), it's an odyssey filled with chases, close calls, near misses, and betrayal that will leave you laughing at every outrageous and surprising twist and turn.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00004XQ83", "B00006LPGP", "B00005NVHA", "B00009W5CA", "B00029LNYQ", "B004U7MR3M", "B000A7DVR2", "B000P0J0EW", "B004SIP8ZM", "B000M7XRAG", "B003UESJME", "B00008RH3J", "B003102JDM", "B00008RH3L", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00007ELF1", "B00006CXGZ", "B0000YTP02", "B001JIE7JC", "B0041SI78O", "B002VECMAE", "B00GMV8L1Q", "B00000GQ3T", "B00A144O70", "6305212112", "B001B1UO7G", "B003AWRMCE", "0792843568", "B004SIP95G", "B002T9H2LA", "B001VC99HQ", "B000XR9L50", "B004SEUJO6", "B004AOECXI", "B002VWNICC", "6304711905", "B007L6VR12", "B007N31YH0", "B0000TANUI", "B0007PALZ2", "B000E8QVWY", "B0000033GO", "B0002V7ON8", "B00AEFXNLY", "B00AEFYMGO", "B001HN69AY", "B002VWNIAY", "B00AEBB9SM", "B0001GOH6Q", "B002VWNIBI", "B0009IOR5M", "B000RTB0R6", "0767818105", "B000GFRI4K", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B004SIP90G", "B0001Z4OXS", "B001KXZGO6", "B0001NBMTE", "B002O3Z4Z2", "B00AEBB8NS", "B00000G3PA", "B005LAIIJY", "B0002A2WDQ", "078322592X", "B0019L770A", "B00003CXC5", "B00H7KJRVY", "B00005JNBQ", "B00177YA1K", "B001DZOCY6", "B002VECM6S", "B0000JBALO", "B00EIBO8T6", "B00005PJ6O", "0767836359", "B000056VP4", "B0000CBY1C", "B00287Z18Y", "0783237367", "B00003CXIP", "B00AEFXJ86", "B00AEBB8NI", "B007STBUHI", "6305236569", "B00AEFXDO6", "0783230494", "B002NZK5TG", "0783229526", "B00553K8FY", "B00005JNY3", "B000A2UBN4", "B00AEFXXMI", "B00005V9HH", "B0000AC8LR", "B00AEBB9FA", "0767802519", "B00AEBB9F0", "B0012IWNZY"], "bought_together": ["B00004XQ83"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00004XQ83", "B00G4DTSUK", "B00003CXC3", "B00006LPGP"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 2194}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.19, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B00003CXRM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5107M4P37AL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "O Brother, Where Art Thou?"}
{"description": "Men of Honorpresents a great role model for younger viewers, yet it's rated R due to abundant use of theFword. With appropriate discretion, parents should allow their preteen and teenaged children to see this rousing if altogether conventional biopic inspired by the life of Carl Brashear. Played with gravity and gumption by Cuba Gooding Jr., Brashear was the first African American to become a master diver in the U.S. Navy, despite the lingering effects of segregation, opposition from Navy brass, and the amputation of his left leg following a tragic on-duty accident. Robert De Niro adds marquee value and salty bluster as Billy Sunday, the drunken, redneck (and fictionalized) Master Chief who watches, with gradual admiration, as Brashear attains his ultimate goal through sheer force of will.This is all quite uplifting on its surface, but in attempting to hit the requisite highlights of an inspiring biography, director George Tillman Jr. (Soul Food) reduces Brashear's achievement to a succession of clich&eacute;s, forcing Gooding and De Niro to battle sentiment with their noteworthy performances. As Sunday's neglected wife, Charlize Theron is completely extraneous; Hal Holbrook's diving-school commander is a ranting caricature; and newcomer Aunjanue Ellis barely registers as Brashear's wife (in part because their obligatory romance is handled with an utter lack of finesse). There's no question that Brashear's efforts are heroic and worthy of recognition, soMen of Honorserves its basic purpose. Still, one can't help but wonder if Brashear's story would be even more impressive with a more authentic treatment.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000KF0GWW", "B00005B6JZ", "B000F6IODE", "B00005JLRZ", "B00003CXGV", "6304765258", "1558908315", "B0007KIFGE", "B00319ECI8", "B00005JA9F", "B00125WAWS", "B0006L0L5C", "B000P0J0C4", "B000056VP4", "0790736411", "B000065U1N", "B005LAIGN2", "B00AEFYRP0", "B002NZK5VO", "B003ASLJOU", "B0002WZTOI", "B00005JPBO", "0790732238", "6305432317", "B00003CXHJ", "B00005N5S3", "B002VWNICM", "B002AT8K9W", "B002VECM6S", "B00067BCBI", "B00008EY60", "B00000G3PA", "B005LAIGYQ", "B00005JKTP", "B002D755AI", "B000095WW8", "B00AEFY5B6", "B0045HCJHQ", "B00AEFXOKO", "B00AEBB9NM", "B00003CXTG", "B000P0J0EM", "B00008K76U", "B00AEBBA36", "B00005JK8K", "B000KGGIZK", "0800177967", "B00026ZD04", "B000EXZFCQ", "B00003CXFV", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00004XPPG", "B004SIP7ZS", "0792159659", "B000E8QVWY", "B00005PJ8L", "B00AEFYENK", "B00005JLSB", "B00008L3S6", "B000P0J0CE", "B00001ZWUS", "B000P0J09C", "B0006GAOJA", "0451409744", "6304711891", "B00AEFYUQQ", "B00E8G5HZ0", "B002GHHHPQ", "B00441GZ1Y", "B000JYW5BE", "B00005Y1UX", "B001FB55L2", "0790730979", "0783226845", "0783240295", "B00004W221", "0783225733", "B00005JKWX", "B00G4Q3KOC", "B0045HCJ8K", "B00HLTD3ZW", "6305213305", "B00AEFXT1S", "B000SFOW8I", "B000EHSVSC", "B0006IIOHC", "B001QERPAC", "B000P0J0EW", "B004AOECXI", "0780631684", "B00HZMZ2FE", "B00096S49Y", "B0000542CK", "B000066HAS", "B000A2UBN4", "B0043X1FL8", "B00005JNQA", "B000059TFO", "B00003CXTM"], "bought_together": ["B000KF0GWW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00003CXRP", "B005LAIHXQ", "B00DV2MVWO", "B000KF0GWW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 125288}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.99, "brand": "TCFHE", "asin": "B00003CXPP", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516WESMCF3L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Men of Honor"}

{"description": "Tommy Lee Jones and Samuel L. Jackson deliver electrifying performances in this \"\"tense, superbly-directed and top-drawer drama\"\"* about what happens when the rules that command a soldier become the rules that condemn him. Colonel Terry Childers (Jackson) is a patriot and war hero. But when a peacekeeping mission he leads in Yemen goes terribly wrong, he finds himself facing a court martial. Accused of breaking the rules of engagement by killing unarmed civilians, Childers' only hope of vindication rests with comrade-in-arms Hays Hodges (Tommy Lee Jones), a military lawyer of questionable abilities. Together, they face the battle of their lives.Directed by Oscar.-winning director William Friedkin and co-starring Guy Pearce, Bruce Greenwood, Anne Archer and Academy Award.-winner Ben Kingsley, Rules of Engagement is \"\"a magnificent movie you must see.\"\"** *Jeffrey Lyons, NBC-TV **Larry King, USA Today\"", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JA9F", "B002AT8K9W", "0792159659", "B00009L1TA", "0790736411", "B00009RDG9", "B0007KIFGE", "0792835727", "B000N3SRO0", "6304765258", "B00AEFXT1S", "B0011V7PSC", "B00096S49Y", "B000OT6V0K", "B000QUCRB4", "1558908315", "B003ASLJIQ", "6305428115", "6304711891", "B002NZK5VO", "0790732149", "B000JYW5BE", "B001NFNFIK", "B007FQXEXW", "B005FQ2HDC", "B00004Z1FX", "B000095WW8", "B00005B6JZ", "B00AEBBA36", "B00AEFXEGS", "B000F8O2QU", "0783240295", "B00AEFYF2K", "B000055Y0Y", "B0015D20FE", "B00AEFYUQQ", "B00003CXHJ", "B00004ZBVG", "B0050MB4OO", "B000BT98XK", "B00029RT9E", "B002O3Z4Z2", "0783226888", "B002O3Z4WK", "B000NTMA0Q", "B00008K76U", "B002AS464Q", "B000065U1N", "B00BTYNXL4", "B0002J4X2K", "B00AEFYENK", "B000067IZ3", "B00015YVDG", "0767817745", "B000B8GT92", "B002FU8IWU", "B000035P5V", "B00005JKQS", "B000ELL1R6", "B00005ATZT", "B00001ZWUS", "B002NZK5R8", "B000ENC5YW", "B00AEBB86U", "B000EHSVPK", "B004SIP8ZM", "B000BNTM9G", "B00005JKTP", "B00005JLX2", "B003AWRMAG", "B00003CWU3", "6305263248", "0767817648", "B000P5FH3K", "0790730979", "B002NZK5UU", "B000069I1H", "B00005BCKF", "B000G6BLHY", "0767803434", "B0045HCJFS", "6304806434", "B00005JKBC", "B0011VIODW", "B00005JK8K", "6304806450", "B00AEFXYJA", "B0000A2ZU1", "B00096S4DK", "B00008K76W", "B004IK30MI", "B00005JKNV", "0780621603", "B0006210ZG", "B001NY4WYC", "B004P7CMVE", "6304712898", "B00005JL8F", "0800141806"], "bought_together": ["B002AT8K9W"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AEFY412", "B000RXZL0O", "B00009L1TA", "B000065U1N"]}, "price": 6.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 84321}, "asin": "B00003CXGV", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51NSMMDA3NL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Rules of Engagement"}

{"description": "Hong Kongwuxiafilms, or martial arts fantasies, traditionally squeeze poor acting, slapstick humor, and silly story lines between elaborate fight scenes in which characters can literally fly.Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragonhas no shortage of breathtaking battles, but it also has the dramatic soul of a Greek tragedy and the sweep of an epic romance. This is the work of director Ang Lee, who fell in love with movies while watchingwuxiafilms as a youngster and madeCrouching Tigeras a tribute to the form. To elevate the genre above its B-movie roots and broaden its appeal, Lee did two important things. First, he assembled an all-star lineup of talent, joining the famous Asian actors Chow Yun-fat and Michelle Yeoh with the striking, charismatic newcomer Zhang Ziyi. Behind the scenes, Lee called upon cinematographer Peter Pau (The Killer,The Bride with White Hair) and legendary fight choreographer Yuen Wo-ping, best known outside Asia for his work onThe Matrix. Second, in adapting the story from a Chinese pulp-fiction novel written by Wang Du Lu, Lee focused not on the pursuit of a legendary sword known as \"The Green Destiny,\" but instead on the struggles of his female leads against social obligation. In his hands, the requisite fight scenes become another means of expressing the individual spirits of his characters and their conflicts with society and each other.The filming required an immense effort from all involved. Chow and Yeoh had to learn to speak Mandarin, which Lee insisted on using instead of Cantonese to achieve a more classic, lyrical feel. The astonishing battles between Jen (Zhang) and Yu Shu Lien (Yeoh) on the rooftops and Jen and Li Mu Bai (Chow) atop the branches of bamboo trees required weeks of excruciating wire and harness work (which in turn required meticulous \"digital wire removal\"). But the result is a seamless blend of action, romance, and social commentary in a populist film that, like its young star Zhang, soars with balletic grace and dignity.--Eugene Wei", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0007QS27K"], "also_viewed": ["B0007Q6VXC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 367958}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 0.95, "brand": "", "asin": "B00003CXR3", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51G39T50SDL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]"}
{"description": "LikeSaving Private Ryan,Enemy at the Gatesopens with a  pivotal event of World War II--the German invasion of  Stalingrad--re-created in epic scale, as ill-trained Russian soldiers  face German attack or punitive execution if they flee from the enemy's  advance. Director Jean-Jacques Annaud captures this madness with urgent  authenticity, creating a massive context for a more intimate battle  waged amid the city's ruins. Embellished from its basis in fact, the  story shifts to an intense cat-and-mouse game between a Russian shepherd  raised to iconic fame and a German marksman whose skill is unmatched in  its lethal precision. Vassily Zaitzev (Jude Law) has been sniping Nazis  one bullet at a time, while the German Major Konig (Ed Harris) has been  assigned to kill Vassily and spare Hitler from further embarrassment.There's love in war as Vassily connects with a woman soldier (Rachel  Weisz), but she is also loved by Danilov (Joseph Fiennes), the Soviet  officer who promotes his friend Vassily as Russia's much-needed hero.  This romantic rivalry lends marginal interest to the central plot, but  it's not enough to make this a classic war film. Instead it's a taut,  well-made suspense thriller isolated within an epic battle, and although  Annaud and cowriter Alain Godard (drawing from William Craig's book and  David L. Robbins's novelThe War of the Rats) fail to connect  the parallel plots with any lasting impact, the production is never less  than impressive. Highly conventional but handled with intelligence and  superior craftsmanship, this is warfare as strategic entertainment,  without compromising warfare as a manmade hell on Earth.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEFXRRO", "B004U7MQWY", "B00AEBBA36", "B00001ZWUS", "B0007KIFGE", "B000065U1N", "B0015D20FE", "B001KZOUU0", "B00005PJ8T", "079284646X", "B001TUZG4K", "B00005JPKE", "B000095WW8", "B00003CXHJ", "B009XTF8NI", "0792839730", "B000M4RG42", "B00005JK8K", "B000P0J09C", "B00275EGWY", "B00003CXTG", "B003ASLJOU", "B003ELKNH2", "B000EHSVSC", "B004C45AZU", "B00AEFXKUI", "B00004XPPG", "0142000000", "B0007TKNGA", "B00HEPE6MM", "B00B0U2SFE", "B00005N5S3", "B00005PJ8S", "B00AEFYBA6", "B00006CXSS", "B00005ASGB", "B002ZG97RE", "B0007TKNLA", "0767802470", "B00IVLR9JA", "B00A34LX2M", "B00AEFY0F2", "0767817745", "B001LMAK9M", "B0000542CK", "B005LAIGYQ", "B000EHSVS2", "B00AEBB86U", "B00D3XMA9A", "B0000714C4", "B000XR9L50", "B000H1RFSM", "B005E2YL3Q", "B004TXFFI6", "6304698747", "0792838041", "B00008AOTR", "B000ELL1R6", "B002O3Z4Z2", "B000E5N63Y", "B000YBKO6U", "B00BY0EBK0", "6305558167", "B002O3Z50Q", "B00005PJ8K", "B006TTC5HC", "B0007TKNM4", "B00AEFY4IA", "6304765258", "B00AEBB86A", "B000DZIGDU", "B000FVQLRA", "B00AEFY5B6", "6305692688", "B002CPMB9O", "B00AMSLDTM", "B0000TANUI", "B00JA3RVG4", "B004SIP6QI", "B000O599YO", "B000MZHW40", "B00004XPPC", "0792838408", "B007HCI42A", "B0009RCPUC", "B00005B6JZ", "B0002YLCG0", "B00CZB9BE8", "B002O3Z510", "B00005OSJQ", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00005QAQI", "B000CNESN0", "B00008AOTO", "B005DKS1TE", "B00DL48BM6", "0792841662", "B0001NBMH6", "B0001FGC1U", "6304711891"], "bought_together": ["B00AEFXRRO", "B00AEBBA36"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00001ZWUS", "B00AEFXRRO", "B00AEBBA36", "B00HEPE6MM"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 22765}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.69, "brand": "Paramount Home Video", "asin": "B00003CXRA", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510oEAHvU8L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Enemy at the Gates"}
{"description": "It's hard to believe that a movie about two hairpiece salesmen in war-torn Northern Ireland--a comedy, no less--could work at all, butAn Everlasting Piecedoes work, though perhaps not in the way one would expect. Colm (Barry McEvoy, who also wrote the screenplay) is a new barber at a mental institution and bonds with his fellow barber George (Brian F. O'Byrne) even though Colm is Catholic and George is Protestant. A new patient arrives, who turns out to have been the owner of the only wig company in all of Northern Ireland. Figuring that having a monopoly means easy money, Colm and George convince the new patient to give them his client list, and they're off on a series of rambling comic adventures, aided by Colm's girlfriend Bronagh (Anna Friel,A Midsummer Night's Dream). But when a wig is found at the site of an act of IRA sabotage, the salesmen's lives get suddenly complicated. What makesAn Everlasting Piecework is not that it ignores the Irish conflict, but that it pays close attention to it; in fact, the tension of civil strife is a crucial element of the movie's humor, allowing it to dip into a more serious mood without becoming preachy or pretentious. The actors are uniformly excellent; Friel is particularly charming. A comedy about wigs sounds like goofy slapstick;An Everlasting Pieceis actually thoughtful and richly human.

When the women of the town refuse to sell her edible food at the market, Mal&egrave;na has little choice but to become what she's been unjustly accused of being. At the end, a twist of fate turns this tale of longing and jealousy into a heartbreaking love story. Monica Bellucci exudes the can't-help-it eroticism that makes Mal&egrave;na such a lightning rod for everyone's desires; she's like a more zaftig Isabelle Adjani. The movie seems to wander at times, but the ending has a powerful emotional impact. From the director ofCinema Paradiso.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000FWHW68", "B00598OA2C", "B000I0RNV6", "B0006JMLVQ", "B000WMEE9E", "B004P0IRHE", "B00009W0U4", "B0040QYRT0", "B0000C23T0", "B003U4H0CE", "B004SIP8W0", "B0043CT9E4", "B001OXLGJQ", "B00860YICC", "B0019K4YT8", "B0018O50VG", "B0033PQUXA", "B004R4PWYY", "B000CR8QV6", "6305081034", "6305291403", "B000IB0ESY", "B00HRJVHEK", "B0026IQTQS", "B00005JMIJ", "B00GS08Y3Q", "B001NI6BJC", "B00008G7UL", "B000NY1EAS", "B00023P4I8", "B00598O9V4", "B0040J1RX6", "B001CIOCLC", "B000C1VB8M", "B007AFBYTO", "B004SEUJEG", "B00003JRAV", "B0000DZ3BJ", "B0006J27WO", "B001NH4CIA", "B000PKG8TM", "B004SUDQC2", "B004MOJW0E", "B0007TZHWA", "B000E3L7M8", "B001RTKKS0", "B002JTMNZ0", "B00GRZPRB4", "B000XA5K48", "B0076ANKUY", "B002VECLXC", "B0000CE684", "B00007K02I", "B0036TGSJE", "B00G5RA3T0", "B00GPPXNIK", "B000EZ9084", "B00005LZOD", "B001DJ7PSC", "B004D45NZG", "B0019UGYAU", "B003ODKZTQ", "B00375LBKI", "B000CBG5PG", "B003L20INS", "B001CRC4DG", "B000AYELEC", "B00112S8RS", "B000G0O5HS", "B008LC8V1Y", "B000HT38EO", "B000FIHN5M", "B000N3T0DW", "B00005JMU1", "B001URA5Y8", "B002BWP3UC", "B004M66YUS", "B00AYGVCCK", "B00006LPER", "B001AIQ14A", "B00CDV4PPK", "B006M3M5FM", "B00004ZETA", "B008WAM2EM", "B0000589U4", "B0007M222A", "B0010SAGHS", "B001LMU1C8", "B00E8G5HXM", "B000E3L7L4", "B00008972P", "B003U6SJY0", "B00E8G5H8W", "B00005JKGO", "B0002DB52M", "B006Z7Z3VS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004SIP6E0", "B00598OA2C", "B004SIP8W0", "B0019K4YT8"]}, "price": 21.0, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 75490}, "asin": "B00003CXXY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518ZE6VRWJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Malena"}
{"description": "Although this DVD is wrapped in the handsome packaging of the \"Vista Series,\" the extras here are minimal. The first disc has no extras but is packed with four separate Dolby Digital 5.1 tracks and is THX certified. The second disc holds four features, including a standard making-of featurette (15 minutes long) and a nifty segment that allows viewers to compare the storyboards to the final film and separate the music and sound effects in the train station sequence. More satisfying is the 20-minute short on the state of comic books, featuring revealing comments from critics and authors including Frank Miller (of the touchstoneDark Knightseries). Seven deleted scenes are introduced by the director, and while none is significant to the plot, they are all must-see for fans of the film.

{"description": "In the first season ofThe X-Files, creator Chris Carter was uncertain of the series' future, so each of the episodes is a self-contained suspense story; they do not delve deep into the ongoing X-Files mythology or turn to self-parody and humor as do episodes in later seasons. Yet, these episodes display the elements for which the show would become famous: the cinematic production values and top-notch special effects, the stark lighting of the Vancouver sets, the atmospheric halo of Mark Snow's score, and the clever plots dealing with subjects ranging from the occult, religion, and monsters to urban legends, conspiracy theories, and science fiction. Most importantly, season&nbsp;1 introduces FBI agents Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and Fox \"Spooky\" Mulder (David Duchovny), two of the most attractive government officials around. Scully is the serious-minded medical scientist assigned to join Mulder on the X-Files, a division of the FBI dealing with the paranormal. Mulder is the intuitive thinker with a dry wit, a passionate believer in the existence of paranormal phenomena and one of the few characters on television smart enough to figure out who the bad guy is before the audience does. Their muddled relationship, a deep friendship laced with sexual tension, provides the human heart in a world where the bizarre and horrible lurk in everyday society.The materials on the bonus disc provide some interesting trivia and background, but it is the 24 episodes themselves that make this seven-disc boxed set a true find. Those unfamiliar withThe X-Filesoften view all the fuss with the same skepticism with which Scully first regards her new partner's ideas. But just as she comes to realize the uncanny accuracy of Mulder's outlandish theories, newcomers toThe X-Fileswho sample a few episodes in this boxed set will likely find themselves riveted to their television late into the night. And undoubtedly, the shadows and creaking noises in the house that evening will seem more menacing than usual.--Eugene Wei", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000BOH98G", "B000BOH990", "B000CNE0SS", "B000CNE0T2", "B000CNE0TC", "B000EXDS34", "B000EXDS3E", "B000EXDS3Y", "B0007X7044", "B001G7PSZI", "B001FACH7S", "B0006UEVUE", "B001CY5N00", "B00005JA9M", "B0007ZEO7I", "B000002N3A", "B00CRVL5ZE", "B002GP7ZVY", "B00FXW9664", "B002GP7ZVO", "B000083C6V", "B00003CXIS", "B001G7PSSK", "B003V1IU3O", "B000ATQYWY", "B004X60QE2", "B000244E2O", "B0030E5PYO", "B002GP7ZV4", "B000NDEXK2", "B002ZCY872", "0792839056", "B0012CJQYG", "B0002I848K", "B000EBGFPY", "B000UX6THK", "B001C4CI8U", "B00BTYNXJG", "B00005JNOG", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B006BZ8NSE", "B00GTZWZH6", "B00465I156", "B000R7GKQE", "B0002PYS7Y", "B000F8O2Q0", "B000F8O2PQ", "B00466H3CW", "B0009X76XW", "B001T21R5U", "B00005Y1NF", "B000AQ68Z0", "B001BSBBGC", "B000063V8R", "B000BGR1B4", "B007C8RZQ0", "B002BWP2IK", "B0058JEHTS", "B002GP7ZW8", "B000667HBS", "B00DNUSFZQ", "B00CDAG0WW", "B00AEBB9AK", "B000FOPPBA", "B000056T4I", "B001FB4W0C", "B001KOFH2G", "B002JVWRAO", "B0009NZ2RE", "B004QOB8TS", "B000AJJNI6", "B0002ERWVE", "B00BM2JVAA", "0790742012", "B000VDDDY6", "B000F8O2OW", "B00HR2HTRQ", "B004YM6JI2", "B00005JNEQ", "B00003CXZ4", "B000FJH5M2", "B001MVWRNE", "0783225725", "B000EXDS7K", "B00019074O", "B000JLTRHW", "B003BNO9GO", "B001G0MFIS", "B0032JTV6A", "B000FIMG68", "B004LROMWU", "B00008972G", "B001DMVZJ4", "B0011UF79M", "B005FISBTO", "B001715A92", "B000P6YNSE", "B00009PY45", "B00BYNL8DU", "B008B4KVRE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00CRVL5ZE", "B000BOH990", "B000BOH98G", "B0007X7044"]}, "price": 1.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 170142}, "asin": "B00003RQND", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51G8JY0Q71L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The X-Files - The Complete First Season"}

{"description": "Steve Buscemi subtly refines the prison drama in his second film, a rich character piece set in a ramshackle state penitentiary. Edward Furlong is a glum, drug-dealing, middle-class bad boy suddenly drop-kicked into a world in which his sneering defiance just makes him more attractive prey to hardened convicts. Willem Dafoe, a career felon who runs the prison's contraband network, takes the kid under his wing and his protection. He's obviously attracted to the pretty boy and that sexual tension buzzes throughout the film, but their friendship, which is much more complicated, becomes the center of the film.Buscemi allows the story to trickle along, downplaying the usual prison clich&eacute;s to delve into the often murky relationships between prisoners, the predatory pecking order, and the undercurrent of racial divisions. He suggests everything in glances, threats, and tensions that only rarely erupt into violence. The film lacks a strong narrative line, but Buscemi's sensitivity to his characters and his sharp ensemble direction provide generous compensation. Dafoe is brilliant as the smiling smooth operator, his shaved head and jagged-toothed grin suggesting both a threatening confidence, and Furlong ably registers the fear of his sheer defenselessness in this dangerous world. Tom Arnold shines as a terrifying bully and Mickey Rourke is almost unrecognizable as Furlong's cross-dressing cellmate with a honeyed Southern lilt and makeup that would make Tammy Faye Bakker proud.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001AK3S4O", "B00007BK2R", "0790750198", "B0000714BS", "B00004RE27", "B00006JMPS", "6305177937", "B0001US62I", "B0009R1TI6", "B000031EFY", "B00HOGBXS6", "B00I83WKTA", "B007NE07VI", "B000P0J0D8", "B00HT2L7VS", "B00005JM23", "B004LYWPZE", "B00CDV4I98", "1573623857", "B00005Y6X6", "B002AS463W", "B002CTJW0G", "B00J0IN6Z4", "B002DYYGO2", "B00D6I7G00", "B008OTTT88", "B000NJM6E6", "B00DMDE01W", "B001GD6VTE", "B006ZGROB6", "B000ZN71JK", "B00003CWTI", "B00005V9HX", "B00005BCKG", "B001U0HB5Q", "B00005PJ6Q", "B00005Y6YJ", "B0049D1T7W", "B00005N89M", "B004LWZW8I", "B00005O5AY", "B002R0LRJ4", "B00CBFB8SU", "B00008AOX2", "B0041QSZM4", "B000PHVY6W", "B0000C504B", "B000ZBEOGA", "B000092T3X", "B009POCG0Y", "B0002B14UC", "B00005V9HH", "B005IUIXCE", "B00005QBZA", "B0019L0ACM", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B00005BJWC", "B00000IQC9", "B000059TFP", "B000ZM1MGE", "B006W4KVH0", "B00029NLJQ", "B0007VZ99E", "B00AEBB91E", "6305744653", "B000087EYX", "B00008978T", "B00275EGNS", "B00004ZESY", "B000CQLZ0Q", "B00007EFIJ", "B008FYZIR8", "B001J710Y8", "B000QGEB1M", "B0009S2T0M", "B00005B8UA", "6305594333", "B000056PNL", "B000PAAJZ6", "B00004RJ71", "B00007ELEN", "B000NOKFHQ", "B00005U14H", "B00CX7TOOG", "B006XMK11W", "B000065V40", "B00005O06V", "B00008RH3L", "B000HC2LHG", "B004VT9JLM", "B009WGYXIS", "B002O3Z4Y8", "B004U7MR14", "B001TOD92C", "B00EYPJHDI", "B000QXDCLK", "B001CDFY50", "B002WJHBCC", "B002ZG97CO", "B00D5XC8PE"], "bought_together": ["B001AK3S4O", "B0000714BS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000Y7U97I", "B001AK3S4O", "B007NE07VI", "0312267118"]}, "price": 9.95, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 167858}, "asin": "B00004XPPJ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51j45%2BH5O1L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Animal Factory [DVD]"}

{"description": "One of the overlooked films of the 1980s, perhaps because it is such a downbeat tale of an amoral family. Sean Penn plays a kid whose small-time criminal impulses are stoked to a new level when he falls in with his father (Christopher Walken), a vicious career criminal for whom no problem is so large that it can't be solved by a murder. At first exhilarated by the attention from his father (and the jobs he gives him to do), he gradually catches on to just what a bad guy Dad really is. But when he tries to extricate himself, he discovers that Dad now has him squarely in his sights. Penn is terrific in a role of emotional complexity, while Walken, king of the creeps, is positively frightening as this soft-spoken but highly lethal patriarch.--Marshall Fine", "related": {"bought_together": ["B00005NKV6"], "also_viewed": ["6304297564"]}, "price": 22.75, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 603965}, "asin": "B00004Y871", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41RXW7R5RAL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "At Close Range [VHS]"}
{"description": "If you've seenScreamandI Know What You Did Last Summer, then you know the entire plot ofScary Movie. That's okay, though, because this is a parody, and it helps to know the story in order to be able to get the jokes. No, the biggest surprise here is not the  story as much as the amount of full-frontal male nudity. Really, in addition to all the dick jokes (and the ass jokes and fart jokes), there's a couple of shots of the male member, one of which is erect and used as a weapon.Scary Moviesomehow ended up with an R rating, which in a sense is groundbreaking; perhaps our ratings board is loosening up after all.But is it funny? That's the most important question, and the answer to that is yes. In the vein ofAirplane!, with a dash of the Farrelly brothers,Scary Moviekeeps throwing jokes at you one after another. The law of averages says some of them have to hit, and enough of them do to keep the movie entertaining. Unlike the makers ofAirplane!, however, the Wayans brothers aren't making this movie out of a love of the genre, and unlike the Farrelly brothers, they don't make fun of retarded people with any sort of respect, so the humor throughout feels a lot uglier. Still, there are enough funny scenes inScary Movieto make the viewing experience worthwhile. Special credit must go to Lochlyn Munro as Greg, the over-the-top jock, who steals the movie up until the time he's gotta die.--Andy Spletzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004SIP9I8", "B004SIP9KQ", "B000FOQ1KY", "B00CAATSME", "B0009P42WI", "B001J710YI", "B004SIP9O2", "B00AZMFINM", "B004SIP9MY", "B0016MJ6J2", "B004SIP9P6", "B000F9RLL2", "B004LWZW2O", "B005CFBYW6", "B004P7CMZ0", "6305017115", "B005DCJ218", "B0000VCZMK", "B00177YA06", "0780631684", "B000055WFZ", "B00008K7AM", "B002IT5GDC", "B000O76ZOO", "B0002VYOVI", "B00AEFXQLQ", "B000RIWAVW", "B001NPD9LS", "B000069CF0", "B004SIP8ES", "B00441GYVA", "630529142X", "B000FA57UI", "B000AM4P9K", "B009XTF8KQ", "B002A5EBMQ", "0767811070", "B00AEFYPXY", "B00005LC4Q", "B002Q4VBPQ", "B000K405CY", "B000IFRT4W", "B0021L8UXA", "B003Q6D27S", "B000FC2HS6", "B00081912E", "B00003CY5Y", "0783235070", "B00AEFYYH6", "B00H0EN98E", "B004EPZ084", "B000FA57US", "B001P3SA9Y", "B0031U8OEK", "B00003CXPS", "B003PIUINS", "B000VKL6Z2", "B001L9EXUC", "B000WZEZGI", "B003UESJBU", "B005DEUEXQ", "B00003CXS7", "B00009PY4G", "B00BEIYGT8", "B002GHHHG0", "B006W4KVH0", "B000GBEWHK", "B00AJLHUA8", "B002ZG971U", "B000WGYMTC", "B00J5JSV3A", "B00005K3NR", "B000J4QW7W", "B001J9KJ4I", "B00003CXZ1", "B004EPZ06G", "B000V4UFZK", "B0006SSOHC", "B00001QGUM", "B000022TSW", "B00AEFYE08", "0767824954", "B000031WD9", "B00004STUL", "B00005JNZU", "B004SEUJO6", "B008R65XTC", "B00BEIYMAG", "B00AQJ8MLY", "B00AEFY37C", "B002ZG97TW", "B00005N7Z1", "B004P7CN7W", "B00003CY6D", "B00E8RKHWW", "B00BEIYMZ6", "B008G33PIM", "B000P0J09M", "B00006FDCD", "B00AEFYQWO"], "bought_together": ["B004SIP9I8", "B004SIP9KQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000FOQ1KY", "B004SIP9KQ", "B004SIP9I8", "B008MXMFVE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 150447}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.99, "brand": "Dimension", "asin": "B00004Z4WQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5123WET5P4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Scary Movie"}
{"description": "Sidney Poitier is seldom praised as a pioneer of blaxploitation, but that's what he is inThey Call Me Mister Tibbs. This sequel's title is cribbed from its groundbreaking predecessor,In the Heat of the Night, but similarities end there, since this engaging murder mystery owes more to \"blaxpo\" and the urban police procedurals that dominated film and TV in the early 1970s. Poitier's got plenty of proto-funk charisma (and a Quincy Jones groove) as San Francisco detective Virgil Tibbs, dominating his Caucasian colleagues with quiet fortitude and sure-fire instincts. His latest case is rife with likely suspects, including a Bible-thumping reformer (Martin Landau) and a sleazy landlord (Anthony Zerbe). It's a routine plot by latter-day standards, but director Gordon Douglas enlivens it with solid character details: Poitier's scenes with his defiant young son (George Spell) are genuinely moving, and performances are uniformly superb. Poitier did another sequel,The Organization(1971), ending his Tibbs trilogy on a high note of success.--Jeff Shannon", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 49078}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "title": "They Call Me Mister Tibbs!", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000XJD34I", "B000053VBI", "B000TXP56C", "B00003L9C1", "B0044WUZXW", "B00005PJ6T", "B000056HEH", "B00003L9CK", "B0000V499C", "B00003L9CG", "B00008L3UQ", "B0000X61YQ", "B0000TWMQ6", "B0046BHC28", "B008K1PWMW", "B00AATGDW0", "B00007CVRT", "B0006Z2LLK", "B0000VCZQG", "B00GICP84W", "B001QVE3HS", "B002CWKU2M", "B00KIZYDCI", "B0000TWMRU", "B000CNE08S", "B00007AJG2", "B001K2KM82", "B00GM1X2RO", "B00008PC19", "B0000W5J4A", "B00BF0SKKQ", "B00005JP4J", "B00005RIIY", "B00J7YV0UE", "B008NNSD78", "B001T21R50", "B00FWJM8UY", "B000B5XOSY", "B00006CXGH", "B00I86MQF0", "B00GM1X2JM", "B00441GZ1Y", "B0007TKNHE", "B00J7YV09K", "B00007G1ZL", "B001DW2BFQ", "B004MFFB2G", "6306496238", "B00004YS74", "B00I87U9H6", "B0000AN4JE", "B0006GANN2", "B0000AMRUP", "B00020X87U", "B00I87U8UE", "B00006L92P", "B00ICWO1K8", "B00ICWO1LC", "078323208X", "B00G4Q3KOC", "B00006RCO2", "B00E1LQEFE", "B00005A0QS", "6305127654", "B000059TFO", "B004FK5EDY", "B00005IA7Y", "B00AEFY9YY", "B000031EG1", "B001T2YIUG", "B00AEFXRG0", "B000BMY2LU", "B004AZ7ZKY", "B00008G6E8", "B000BUE5FA", "B009CZTFUK", "0790736411", "B001NY4WYC", "B000H5TH1Q", "B000MGTQ7U", "B00005JL8F", "B0077T5SV8", "B00DVPMYWI", "B008A1TWXC", "B00FMDL4UK", "B00004RE45", "B000O599Y4", "B000RTB0R6", "B00FC1ZC9Q", "B00004TJJU", "B0000VD0MY", "B00066VTU8", "B00AEFYG3S", "B001E6JC1W", "B00EV4EUT8", "B001LXIDUO", "B00000CQJZ", "B004AOECXI", "B00AEFXEZE", "B004X63RZW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000XJD34I", "B00003L9C1", "B000TXP56C", "B008K1PWMW"]}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/511JQ8EGCYL._SY300_.jpg", "asin": "B000053VBJ"}
{"description": "When Maggie (Kim Basinger ofL.A. ConfidentialandBatman) comes home to her apartment building one night, she discovers her estranged, drug-addict sister Jenna huddling in the doorway. Jenna promptly abandons her newborn baby with Maggie, who proceeds to raise the child as her own, despite evidence of autism. But as the little girl, Cody, gets older, what seemed to be autism starts to manifest itself in more startling ways. At the same time, a series of child murders are sweeping the city--murders conducted by a mysterious cult with supernatural matters on their mind.Bless the Childstarts promisingly, with subdued, creepy scenes contrasted with more outrageous moments like swarms of computer-generated rats. Fans of religious horror movies will enjoy its twist onThe Omen, with an angelic child instead of a demonic one--only the child is still pretty eerie. The special effects go a little overboard towards the end. Jimmy Smits (Price of Glory) costars as an FBI cult chaser, and Rufus Sewell (Dark City,Cold Comfort Farm) gives a pleasantly restrained performance as the charismatic cult leader.

{"description": "Of all the gimmick matches the WWF has created over the years, the Royal Rumble may be the most fun and captivating. The concept is simple: There's 30 wrestlers and one ring; two men start out going at it and every two minutes a new wrestler enters until there's only one man standing. But though the concept sounds easy, creating a wrestling match that will hold the attention of fans for over an hour is pretty tricky. With this in mind, the WWF added a prize for the winner that gave the Rumble added drama. Whoever survives gets a free pass to the main event at Wrestlemania and a chance to take on the WWF champion. Unlike most wrestling matches, where it's routinely easy to pick a winner, the Royal Rumble--especially the 2000 edition--is constantly difficult to predict. The 2000 Rumble is among the strongest in recent memory, mostly because of the pace, the outcome, and, yes, the dramatic, nearly evangelical play-by-play delivered by Jim Ross (yeah, it's all fixed, but JR gets your adrenaline pumping by the end of the match). What also makes this Rumble so exciting is the addition of four other matches, all of which complement the excitement of the main event. In particular the wars between Triple H and WWF champion Kurt Angle, and bitter Canadian rivals Chris Jericho and Chris Benoit, are well executed and constantly enjoyable. Of all the pay-per-views of 2000, this may be the one to take home and cherish.--Dave McCoy", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000055ZK5", "B00005QAU2", "630571035X", "B000055ZK8", "B000055ZK9", "B000055ZKA", "B00005RJ3K", "B000055ZKC", "B000055ZKE", "B00005QAU1", "6304824424", "B000055ZKD", "B00005T355", "B000055ZKB", "B00005RJ3L", "B00005QAU3", "6305710481", "6305710473", "6305604053", "6303333419", "6305710449", "B0006SSNX2", "6305958637", "B000063UVR", "6305710503", "6305255237", "B000BGH2CM", "B000ZIZXAO", "6305454280", "B00120LPN8", "B00009W0VU", "6305255229", "6304826214", "B00120LPNS", "6305491313", "B00005RJ3N", "B0030BS1HU", "6305229198", "6303084257", "B00281CCK0", "B000055ZK6", "B008WAM2N8", "B00008HCA6", "B00005KH1N", "630527696X", "B000031VPQ", "6305710376", "B00004STEC", "B00005AADX", "6305015074", "6304826206", "B00007M5KC", "B000053V54", "B0001EQIG0", "6305255210", "B005XLFBDM", "B00005Q4HI", "6305178429", "B000A2XCOO", "B000050IL2", "6305277044", "B000XUF6P6", "B00005MMA6", "B000067JJE", "B00008HCA0", "6305347085", "B004AGN9J4", "B0001BYYAA", "B00006LPKF", "B000CEV3X2", "B000067JJG", "6302260957", "B00000ICDW", "B00005O5NG", "B00001W9GL", "6305276889", "B00028G6N0", "B000BSZAGA", "B00000J11L", "B000089776", "B000LC3IL0", "B000H6SXWO", "B000EQ5VJA", "6303937446", "B00120LPMO", "B00004STEA", "B00008HC9Y", "6305710392"], "bought_together": ["B000055ZKA"], "also_viewed": ["6305710481", "6305604053", "6305710503", "B000055ZK8", "B000055ZKA", "B00005RJ3L", "B00005QAU2", "6305347085", "B000055ZKC", "B000068QOI", "B000055ZKD", "B00005T355", "B00005QAU3", "B00005KHKF", "B000055ZK9", "6305710392", "B00005QAU1", "630571035X", "6305958637", "B00005RJ3K", "6304826206", "B00005Q4EU", "B000055ZK5", "B00005KHKG", "B00009W0VU", "6305255210", "B000055ZKB", "B00004STEC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 208792}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.24, "brand": "", "asin": "B000055ZK7", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51H4ZH2KW3L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "WWF: Royal Rumble 2001 [VHS]"}
{"description": "On May 6, 1993, the mutilated bodies of three 8-year-old boys were found in a shallow creek in West Memphis, Arkansas. A short time later police arrested three local teenagers, linking the boys' killings to a satanic ritual. One of the boys confessed. The intriguing court case was about to unfold as filmmakers Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky ventured forth to make this documentary. They captured footage of not only courtroom proceedings but also interviews with the major players in trial--parents, suspects, lawyers. The documentary filmmakers, whose previous film,Brother's Keeper, is as intriguing of a crime story you'll ever see, tells this story without re-creations or flashbacks. The film makes a clear argument that the court trial may not be about witchcraft but a witch hunt. As with any great drama, the faces and situations are etched upon the viewer; however, we are dealing with real lives and real crimes (told gruesomely and necessarily by police photographs and videotape), and the impact is far greater. And so is the maddening ambivalence of the trial. Like the O.J. Simpson fiasco, a verdict is reached but the truth is questioned. Did police make fatal errors the night of the crime? Do last-minute clues lead to justice? Who's lying on the stand? As withRoger and MeandHoop Dreams, we have a provocative single incident that holds a mirror to many of society's problems. The results are just more horrifying.

{"description": "Angela Lansbury does the honors as Agatha Christie's determined sleuth, Miss Marple, in this adaptation of Christie's novel. A washed-up movie star (Elizabeth Taylor) is attempting to make a comeback but is driven to distraction by a mysterious event from her past. Also problematic for Taylor's struggling actress is a series of murders occurring with clockwork regularity in the quiet, 1950s English village where a film is being produced--killings that are all somehow connected to her. Despite the British backdrop, most of the suspects, including Rock Hudson, Kim Novak, and Tony Curtis, are American in this 1980 feature directed by Guy Hamilton (Evil Under the Sun). (At least Miss Marple's nephew, the redoubtable Inspector Craddock, is played by Edward Fox.) The bad news: this is a curiously flat, monotonous film, with a mystery hook that, sad to say, is among Christie's more familiar and predictable. Hamilton doesn't demand much of his largely ornamental cast, and they don't volunteer much to fill the void. Still, fans of Miss Marple and Christie, especially those with a burning hunger to see every film or television program based on the books, will want to check it out. This DVD edition is presented in the film's original widescreen format, and it includes television spots that were part of the film's marketing at the time of its theatrical release.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001KZOVJK", "B001KP2J3U", "B00AEFYO5I", "B00005QBZL", "B000GB5M1A", "B000GB5M1K", "B000CSTK38", "B002Q3MYA8", "B00005RDRO", "B000GB5M1U", "B00006FMDT", "B000199JJI", "B000068UE9", "B00000JGHT", "B0007Y3XRG", "B004HHX9H8", "B00AEFXNXW", "B0090XLDO0", "B000059LGD", "B00GWXI0S8", "B00GWXHYPI", "B00005Q4D6", "B00008K772", "B00A0HT99G", "B0083HXKM2", "B001UWOLQG", "B00GWXI2MC", "B007ISJS0U", "B002MUAXJY", "B000R349JI", "B004Z74X0M", "B004VLYHNA", "B000GAKFIG", "B00GAXASKS", "B00GAXASLC", "B0023Y543Y", "B005X5XINI", "B006JY3O2M", "B00D7AM2V0", "B000CRR36K", "B005ZVINFS", "B0006V6RZK", "B0029U0ZZY", "B003YCI238", "B00DW5IKWK", "B00GWXI16O", "B005X5XI4C", "B00ALTQRNO", "B006Z4LP9K", "B004ZEDJLY", "B003ZJ0POO", "B00003CXBZ", "B00EF0NYVI", "B000ERVKJY", "B000OHBCI8", "B003O2H7MA", "B001KZVQJS", "B005DVIPY4", "B000K7UBUM", "B000K2UW4C", "B003ZXNCAE", "B00E44EZUE", "B0028AENVC", "6304160437", "B000SK5Z70", "B00GHH9I62", "B007V4QLWE", "B00IF0KAYS", "B00027JYLM", "B000IJ7AGK", "B00I9BU5ZM", "B00GWXI2RM", "B003B3V0X4", "B00KIZYDCI", "B005TTEG5W", "B00AQ8IUJ4", "B00DZP1C9K", "B000068QOB", "B00004TWZH", "B008N8A3DA", "B000KHI2FS", "B0011UF79M", "B0047CG95W", "B00GD7UO4G", "B00BDSRM4K", "B00005RIX1", "B000TXPXCS", "B003V4JU1W", "B00E8AVN9U", "B002UOMGX8", "B00143XE00", "B000PC6YUS", "B0006212JK", "B00JJRLFTU", "B00IYRLUAU", "B002HR456E", "B0013Z7RUC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001KP2J3U", "B00AEFYO5I", "B001KZOVJK", "B001KP2J44"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 243936}, "asin": "B000059LGG", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516B5GPWKSL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Mirror Crack'd"}

{"description": "The visionary work of science fiction legend Philip K. Dick inspired the filmsBlade Runner(1982),Total Recall(1990), andMinority Report(2002). Films from John Carpenter'sThey Liveto David Cronenberg'seXistenZtoThe 6th Daymine the same sense of the technological morass, complex conspiracies, and manipulated and uncertain realities that Dick spun out in such novels asTime Out of JointandA Scanner Darkly. Dick's unnerving ideas influenced a generation, but despite the title of this labor-of-love documentary, it's less about his work than the life-changing events of the last decade of his life. The bizarre true story of paranoia, mind-altering drugs, mystical visions, and an 8,000-page treatise calledThe Exegesisis as compelling as any of his novels. All it lacks is a grounding: filmmakers Mark Steensland and Andy Massagli take for granted a familiarity with the author and his work. That may leave the casual viewer a bit bewildered by it all, but fans will appreciate the comments of cult author Robert Anton Wilson and rare audio recordings of Dick himself (set to funky minimalist animation). Lacking a strong portrait of Dick's life and work before the visions,The Gospel According to Philip K. Dickis hardly definitive, relying almost solely on interviews to flesh out the figure, but it is a valuable first step in exploring the work of one of the most influential \"unknown\" authors of our time.--Sean Axmaker", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 842724}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.98, "brand": "", "asin": "B000059TOO", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51KW6SCBD0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Gospel According to Philip K.

{"description": "When Sarah (Neve Campbell) strikes up a conversation with a sad-eyed man called Alex (William H. Macy) at her therapist's office, she asks, \"Are you one of those middle-aged guys who's tired of his marriage and thinking maybe a beautiful young thing could help him out?\" She's right, but the source of Alex's depression is far from typical: he's a second-generation hit man who wants out, but his mom and dad won't let him quit.Donald Sutherland makes Alex's laconic and utterly monstrous father the most frightening parent since John Huston inChinatown. A series of flashbacks show how he introduced Alex to his trade, beginning with shooting squirrels in the woods. We never find out whether Alex's father has mob connections, and the fact that it's just a business to him (\"This one's a big job, lots of moola, I'll buy your mother a Lexus\") makes him all the more chilling. Alex's mother (the steely Barbara Bain) knows all about the family business, but his wife (Tracey Ullman) thinks he runs a mail-order company, and the only person he confides in is a therapist (John Ritter). When he meets and falls for Sarah, Alex realizes that he alone can stand up to his father, and he needs to act before his own son becomes the next apprentice.Henry Bromell's debut film as a writer-director probes the same dark corners of the middle-aged male psyche asAmerican BeautyandThe Sopranos. Alex's tormented life is a symbol of the damage that parents can inflict on their children, and Bromell imbues his story with a tragic inevitability.Panicreceived a shamefully limited theatrical release, in spite of its rare combination of a great script and brilliant performances. It deserves to be rediscovered and appreciated by a much larger audience on home video.--Simon Leake", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0007R4TIU", "B007TBJUVI", "B0001EFV7C", "B0002S94C0", "B00005V1XK", "B00003CXNY", "B00018D40O", "B00441GZ00", "B00D5XC8PE", "B00005BCKF", "B009AMAJPA", "B000G1R4RU", "B004FZWDPG", "B00005M2CO", "B00AEFXV3E", "B00006CXGZ", "B000H6SXYM", "B0053TWVQ4", "B00009V7RV", "B001J710Y8", "B000KGGIZK", "B0014D5R9G", "B00008L3S6", "B000CQLZ8S", "B00CX7TOOG", "B0001GF2D8", "B00CJ6EKT0", "B0071HPOHY", "B00003CXDJ", "B00079HZQ6", "B00003CWU3", "B00003CXKS", "0792838068", "B000UAE7KO", "B0001XAOPM", "B000067J3P", "B000RO6K76", "B001NY4WYC", "B007IUEEA2", "B0014GI6I2", "B004P7CMVE", "B008220DGE", "0783226853", "B00003CXGA", "B00005K3NR", "B002VWNICC", "B0034G4P30", "B00C3ALLFS", "B006M3M5FM", "B00005V9HH", "B00BLF9FOK", "B00BMJ7ZKG", "B00AEFYIH2", "B00006FD96", "B007VYECQQ", "630473784X"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B007TBJUVI", "B001TOD6N4", "B0007R4TIU", "B0001EFV7C"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 462511}, "asin": "B00005AA9G", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51YAK36DE5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Panic"}

And if you want info about the movie, you can get that, too: a commentary track by director Sam Raimi, actor Kirsten Dunst, producer Laura Ziskin, and co-producer Grant Curtis, plus a technically oriented commentary by the effects crew; pop-up factoids offering trivia about the movie and comic book; occasional Easter eggs leading to featurettes (e.g., 90 seconds on wrestler Randy Savage as Bonesaw McGraw); and promotional documentaries, screen tests, outtakes, and the like.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JMQW", "B000UR9T8C", "B004LWZWFQ", "B001DHXT20", "B00E5I2MCM", "B00005JNTU", "B001GCUO1Q", "B00005JNJV", "B000AYELVA", "B001CDR1FG", "B000VI70QS", "B0000959N0", "B000AYELVU", "B002GSXKN8", "B00E5I2MEK", "B0002IQMAM", "B0083SBMBM", "B001GZ6QC4", "B008JFUO72", "B00E5I2M6I", "B004LWZW42", "B004EPZ07K", "B0090SI56Y", "B00E5I2M9K", "B008QZ5PY2", "B00JPS7HOA", "B0007P0Y7C", "B000IJ79UW", "B000HCO83Q", "B001QB9H1U", "B000VR0570", "B000HEVZ9E", "B000OVLBF8", "B008JFUS0U", "B008JFUPFI", "B0000VCZLG", "B002A5EBLW", "B000I0RQVI", "B002ZG99B8", "B005G4TJUC", "B002IPFWTE", "B00005JM5E", "B001DJLD2G", "B000J10EQU", "6307397594", "B004LWZWGA", "B00006II6Q", "B000ARXF96", "B000P0J06K", "B00177YA1K", "B00004STUL", "B001OST0M6", "B0049IHX2C", "B0006L0LOS", "B00IGVJGYQ", "0767817478", "B008Y1YK9Y", "B000PGINMQ", "B0025AY3X8", "B002HWRYJE", "B002GSXKNI", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B000GFLKF8", "B00007G205", "B0002KVUKM", "B0060FXDCG", "B007K3JFUQ", "B00005N5S5", "B00000F4ZY", "B001GKJ2E8", "B006VRRGNK", "B00003CXTA", "B0007RT9MG", "B001VLBDD0", "B00F4FFO8E", "B000IJ79VQ", "B0000633UA", "B0000AXE8I", "B000H30B2C", "B0001BKAEY", "0790736411", "B00005JN0T", "B000UNYK4E", "B0001I55N8", "B000KJU1KK", "B00004Z4WR", "B000VNMMR0", "B0006GAO5Y", "B00005JKWJ", "B000U7WV1Y", "B00008G8M4", "B0009A409S", "B0001QNNS4", "B000O78KW4", "B00BEZTMFY", "B001TODCII", "B0009RCPY8", "B001PPLIEG", "B00003CY0V", "B00000JQB5"], "bought_together": ["B00005JMQW", "B000UR9T8C"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004LWZWFQ", "B003YAR97K", "B00005JMQW", "B000UR9T8C"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 9011}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.75, "brand": "Marvel Kids", "asin": "B00005JKCH", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5108SSFB9GL._SX300_.jpg", "title": "Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)"}
{"description": "The plethora of extras on this two-disc set are worth your time. There are several well-produced segments on the physical aspects of the film highlighted by a tour of the vast Cinecitt&#xE0; Studio sets with director Martin Scorsese and production designer Dante Ferretti (with a 360-degree-view feature to boot). Historian Luc Sante introduces you to the Five Corners area in New York circa the mid-19th century, and there's a vintage vocabulary guide (from the 1859 edition ofThe Rogue's Lexicon). Even though it was made as a \"puff piece\" for the movie, the Discovery Channel show \"Uncovering the Real Gangs of New York\" is an informative half-hour on the film's historical background. There's another espresso double-shot from a Scorsese commentary track. Not recorded traditionally as he watches the movie, the track pieces together thoughts from the director including some recorded in an NPR interview. This allows Scorsese to be even more focused, dealing with the history of the time and his own 30-year struggle to make the film. One serious demerit for stretching the feature film over both discs, which most likely had to be done with having both Dolby 5.1 and DTS tracks along with the commentary on the long film.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000M341QE", "B00AEBB9CS", "B00080ZG10", "B00AEBB8NI", "B006OFN0SE", "B00005JLSB", "B000C20VPA", "B000MZHW40", "B001N44BVQ", "B002ZG980U", "B000P0J09M", "B00049QQHI", "B004SIP8ZM", "0767830555", "6305313687", "B0006GAOJA", "B00008975Z", "B0016Q2D66", "B0000DI87S", "B00008DP4C", "B00011CZRE", "B000P0J0EW", "B00004XPPB", "B008R65XYC", "B005LAIIJY", "B0007DFJ0G", "B000C20VRS", "B004SIP95G", "B000286RP2", "B002CPMB9O", "B002T9H2LA", "0307388980", "B004SIP7ZS", "B000A7DVR2", "B00AEFXKUI", "B008MILL8W", "B00AEBB9F0", "B001EZE5DI", "B00AEBB9NM", "B004FQX5B6", "B002QEHPQU", "B004SIP9Z6", "B00H9KKGTO", "B004SIP6GI", "B002VWNIEA", "B0001FGBUW", "B000A2UBN4", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B00003CWM3", "B008D1Q1VA", "B00005V9HH", "B003ASLJQI", "B003ASLJQS", "B007SPPANM", "B000093FLA", "B00003CXZ4", "B00004XPPG", "B00001ZWUS", "B000H5TH20", "B000FKO5QK", "B002ZG99N6", "6304711905", "B0018CMJSU", "0767817710", "B009AMANBA", "079284646X", "B000FS9FCG", "B000065U1N", "B00AEBB89W", "B000P0J0AG", "B004SIP6QI", "B001QTXM5Y", "B004499LWG", "0783227906", "B00AEFY0F2", "B000J4P9P8", "B001GZ6QC4", "B00AEFY5B6", "B00AEBB95K", "B000NOKFHQ", "B002VWNICC", "B00009W5CA", "B004U7MR14", "B004AOECXI", "B00003CXRM", "0783231202", "B000069HZP", "0783229526", "B001JIE7JC", "B00005221M", "B000N6TX1I", "B00005JMJG", "B000N3SRO0", "B00003CXWV", "B00005JMYI", "B003HKN52U", "0790732238", "B00004U103", "B003UESJHO", "B000P0J09C"], "bought_together": ["B000M341QE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002ZG980U", "B000P0J09M", "B0013FXWU6", "B00H9KKGTO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 46244}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.89, "brand": "Miramax", "asin": "B00005JKN9", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516W0haa4aL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Gangs of New York (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)"}
{"description": "WithThe Return of the King, the greatest fantasy epic in film history draws to a grand and glorious conclusion. Director Peter Jackson's awe-inspiring adaptation of the Tolkien classicThe Lord of the Ringscould never fully satisfy those who remain exclusively loyal to Tolkien's expansive literature, but as a showcase for physical and technical craftsmanship it is unsurpassed in pure scale and ambition, setting milestone after cinematic milestone as the brave yet charmingly innocent Hobbit Frodo (Elijah Wood) continues his mission to Mordor, where he is destined to destroy the soul-corrupting One Ring of Power in the molten lava of Mount Doom. While the heir to the kingdom of Men, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), endures the massive battle at Minas Tirith with the allegiance of the elf Legolas (Orlando Bloom), dwarf Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) and the great wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen), Frodo and stalwart companion Samwise Gamgee (Sean Astin) must survive the schizoid deceptions of Gollum, who remains utterly convincing as a hybrid of performance (by Andy Serkis) and subtly nuanced computer animation.Jackson and cowriters Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens have much ground to cover; that they do so with intense pacing and epic sweep is impressive enough, but by investing greater depth and consequence in the actions of fellow Hobbits Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd), they ensure thatReturn of the Kingmaintains the trilogy's emphasis on intimate fellowship. While several major characters appear only briefly, and one (Christopher Lee's evil wizard, Saruman) relegated entirely to the extended version on DVD, Jackson is to be commended for his editorial acumen; like Legolas the archer, his aim as a filmmaker is consistently true, and he remains faithful to Tolkien's overall vision. IfReturnsuffers from too many endings, as some critic suggested, it's only because the epic's conclusion is so loyally inclusive of the actors--most notably Astin--who gave it such strength to begin with. By ending theLOTRtrilogy with noble integrity and faith in the power of imaginative storytelling,The Return of the King, like its predecessors, will stand as an adventure for the ages.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JKZV", "B00003CWT6", "B00BEZTMFY", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B002ZG980U", "B002PMV9FG", "B008UZA8FY", "B001NGML48", "B00005JM5E", "B001GZ6QC4", "B005COPWZW", "B008M4C1EO", "B00HFFE8HE", "039548930X", "B000W7F5SS", "B000I0RQVI", "B002VWNIDG", "B000E6EK2Y", "B001BYMX4A", "B004M1A21K", "B007K3JFUQ", "B001DHXT20", "B001UV4XHY", "0345325818", "B003Y5H54W", "B00005JNJV", "B00E5I2M6I", "B000A3XY5A", "B004LWZWGA", "B000U7WV1Y", "B005LXQLRW", "B001OQCV6A", "B000E8M0VA", "B004SIP8ZM", "B000EHRVMY", "0618640150", "B003ZK99NQ", "B0013FDM7E", "B00005JPH2", "B000UNYK4E", "B009JBWOU0", "B00003CX5P", "B00008G8M5", "B00GKOJ98E", "B004LWZW42", "B000H30B2C", "B000P0J0C4", "B00CZDLGDU", "B000M341QE", "B00008G8M4", "B000FKO5QK", "B00HWWUQYY", "B007SPPANM", "B008JFUO72", "B001DJLD1M", "0345538374", "B00AEFY5B6", "B00005JKCH", "B004SIP9U6", "B000YGGNMO", "B00E5I2M9K", "0618126988", "B005OCFGTO", "B00E8S2JZ4", "6305313687", "B004AKCME8", "B0002KVUKM", "B000AARKOO", "B0006GAO5Y", "B000K7VHQ4", "B002ZG997C", "B00AHTYI5M", "B008JFUS0U", "B0042MEQVG", "B00275EGWY", "B00E9PMML2", "B008UZDXEW", "B004SIP7F8", "B00116GEJS", "B00003CXI1", "B003ZKBELG", "B003Y5H5EW", "B000V4UFZK", "B0007PLLBU", "B001DTPZNY", "B002O3Z50Q", "B001GCUO1Q", "B000LP6KNU", "B005G4TJUC", "B00AW0KHTM", "B002ZG97YM", "054792819X", "B00AEFXZJE", "B0000YEEGM", "B002IPFWTE", "B001ECQ75A", "B000065U1N", "B0051MKNV8", "B000W796OM", "B00J49R1BY"], "bought_together": ["B00005JKZV", "B00003CWT6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00HFFE8HE", "B00003CWT6", "B00005JKZV", "B00BEZTMFY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 1589}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.49, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00005JKZY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HS7iSFv5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)"}

{"description": "An enormously entertaining (if somewhat shallow) affair from blockbuster   director Steven Spielberg. Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Frank Abagnale,  Jr., a  dazzling young con man who spent four years impersonating an  airline pilot, a  doctor, and a lawyer--all before he turned 21. All the  while he's pursued by a  dedicated FBI agent named Carl Hanratty (Tom  Hanks), whose dogged determination  stays one step behind Abagnale's  spontaneous wits. Both DiCaprio and Hanks turn  in enjoyable  performances and the movie has a bouncy rhythm that keeps it  zipping  along. However, it never gets under the surface of Frank's drive to lose   himself in other identities, other than a simplistic desire to please  his father  (Christopher Walken, excellent as always), nor does it  explore the complex  mechanics of fraud with any depth. By the movie's  end, it feels like one of  Frank's pilot uniforms--appearance without  substance.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00080ZG10", "B006OFN0SE", "B000M341QE", "B00AEBB8NI", "B001EZE5DI", "B004SIP7TE", "B000MZHW40", "0767905385", "B00005JMYC", "B002ZG980U", "B00049QQHI", "B0016Q2D66", "B00AEBB9F0", "B00003CWM3", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B000P0J0EW", "B00008DP4C", "B000PHVZNE", "B001N44BVQ", "B00005JOC9", "B004SIP7ZS", "B0007DFJ0G", "B007SPPANM", "B00H9KKGTO", "B002T9H2LA", "0800141806", "B000N6U0E2", "B000P0J0EM", "B00AEBB89W", "B000FVQLQQ", "B00001ZWUS", "B0050546MS", "B00DHHWXYY", "0783225733", "6304711891", "B00AEFY0F2", "B002VWNIEA", "B0051MKNV8", "B002ZG99N6", "B0077ATSSQ", "B00011CZRE", "B0013XZ2QK", "B00275EGWY", "B00005JKBC", "B00003CXWV", "B002O5M4T4", "B002FU8IWU", "B008MILL8W", "B004XQO90O", "B004SIP95G", "B000YAF4MA", "B005LAIIJY", "B00005JMJG", "B002QEHPQU", "0780631536", "B00DHDDE32", "B0031OCY2E", "0783240295", "B000P0J0BK", "B004FQX5B6", "B0034G4OUO", "B005HWAOP2", "6305313687", "B003UESJH4", "B000YABYLA", "B00005JKWX", "B00BEIYL6G", "B0058JEHSO", "B000A7DVR2", "B0002ZDVEU", "B00003CXZ1", "B00003CXQ4", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00005RYLX", "B001VPCINK", "B000FKO5QK", "B0045HCJRG", "B009POCG0Y", "B00AEBB9SM", "B002UZCJ8Y", "B002DU39GW", "6304806434", "B00JQYV0B4", "B00AEFXE9U", "B00004WG2F", "B000EXZFCQ", "B00005JMCN", "B00006RCNV", "B000K7VHQE", "B00441GYXS", "B00A24CAAW", "B0045HCJ8K", "B004SIP9Z6", "B002NZK5R8", "B000K7VHTQ", "B00AEFXXMI", "B00005JL78", "0783233477", "B000J3OTT6", "B000O77SRC"], "bought_together": ["B00080ZG10", "B000M341QE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004SIP7TE", "B002ZG980U", "B00AEBB8NI", "B00ALTQRPW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 7335}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.99, "brand": "Dreamworks Skg", "asin": "B00005JLSB", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51bPnAto--L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Catch Me If You Can (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition)"}

{"description": "With its disturbing images and a few good shocks,The Ringis the kind of frightfest you'll watch to set a chilling mood or spook your susceptible friends, but when you try to sort it out, this well-mounted American remake (of the 1998 Japanese hitRingu, based on Koji Suzuki's popular novel) becomes a batch of incoherent parts. The negligible plot follows a Seattle reporter (Naomi Watts) as she investigates the death of her niece, the victim of a mysterious videotape that, according to urban legend, causes the viewer's death seven days later. (Fear Dot Comborrowed the same idea while avoiding this film's lofty pretensions.) The countdown structure follows the reporter, her son, and her estranged boyfriend into deepening layers of terror--all quite effective until the movie attempts to explain itself. At that you're better off shutting down your brain and letting the creepy visuals take over.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0009X763M", "B0006SGYL0", "B004SIP92O", "B00001QGUM", "B00151QYOO", "B001P3SA9Y", "B009XTF8KQ", "B004LWZW24", "B00004BZIY", "B0021L8UFI", "B001JNNDJM", "B000V4UFZK", "B000PMLJMQ", "B0021L8UPS", "B000TJ6PBK", "B0019X3YX2", "B00005RHGK", "B00BEIYMAG", "B0026LQM2Q", "B00005JNJR", "B003UGLCIA", "B000IHY9TS", "B002VWNIDG", "B00AIBZLVY", "B00AEBBA2W", "B00006FDCD", "B008JFUNYG", "B00EZ50SGW", "B00B96TGQS", "B00005JL3T", "B000BTJDGC", "B00AJLHUA8", "B000OVLBGM", "B000RIWAVW", "B003VA3JUO", "B00DW5IM14", "B00005JNY3", "B0021L8UXA", "B00008LUNW", "B000F6IOAM", "B001D2WU9I", "B002JT69IW", "B000AA4JL6", "B00174RCHW", "B00AQJ8MLY", "B00386EZUY", "B0000VCZMK", "B00018D42W", "B0000E2R6P", "B0006SSOHC", "B001U0HBQA", "B00004TS0G", "B003L20IEW", "B008F283VS", "B001DJLD1W", "B0053TWVDC", "B00007G1ZB", "B0015ET3YO", "B00011CZRE", "B004LWZW2O", "B002ZG971U", "B000088NQR", "B002LMSWN2", "B00AEFXSLE", "B0000648X0", "B00005JOWW", "B00005JNNT", "B0031U8OEK", "B006CXIKYC", "B001MVYUR0", "B004SIP9P6", "B003UN0752", "B001NPD9LS", "B008WAM2E2", "B001B1UO6W", "B000GBEWRU", "B00AZTUUQK", "B0002DB54A", "B004SIP9O2", "0780631684", "B003LR5BD0", "B000GCFO0I", "B000VKL6Z2", "B005CFBYW6", "B008G33PIM", "B000GSYRY6", "B0010X73ZG", "B000AM4P9K", "B000A5045Q", "B000056T5E", "B005TK23PQ", "B004BLJQOK", "0783116926", "B001DZOC6Y", "B00BEIYG98", "B005LAIGOQ", "B0097C046W", "B0013FDM7E", "B00BEIYGT8", "B0001FR3IQ"], "bought_together": ["B0009X763M", "B0006SGYL0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004LWZW24", "B000V4UFZK", "B00BEIYMAG", "B00005JNY3"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 99771}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.79, "brand": "Dreamworks Skg", "asin": "B00005JLTK", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51MKWPKHSTL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Ring (Widescreen Edition)"}

The best feature is an hourlong collection of interviews of people who worked on the comic book, from Stan Lee to Frank Miller to Kevin Smith.  (Yes, sharp-eyed fans: the Elektra-Bullseye showdown was closely based onDaredevil#181.)  On the film side, director-screenwriter Mark Steven Johnson and producer Gary Foster's commentary track provides background info and some fawning over Jennifer Garner, a text commentary provides more trivia and inside jokes, and an enhanced viewing mode offers production-design featurettes. Most prominently among a bunch of other features, another hourlong documentary goes behind the shooting of the film, and Garner tries to keep a straight face during her screen test.

{"description": "WithInfernal Affairs, Hong Kong filmmakers Wai Keung Lau and Siu Fai Mak have successfully taken a smart script and a great cast, added some stylistic cinematography, and dual-fistedly given a new twist to a formulaic genre.  Lau Kin Ming (Andy Lau), a young, loyal gangster, is ordered by his Triad boss Sam (Eric Tsang) to join the police force. While on the inside the young mole can keep a close eye on police activity, ensuring the gang's activities will not be interrupted. Police Superintendent Wong (Anthony Wong Chau-Sang) has a similar plan. He takes a bright, ambitious police cadet Yan (Tony Leung Chiu Wai) and makes him an undercover cop with plans to get him inside the Triads.  Years pass and both are now deep into their assigned roles. Undercover cop Yan, more or less living the life of a gangster, is now a member of Boss Sam's group, and \"Officer\" Lau has all the appearance of a good cop trying to bust up the Triads' drug ring. During a bust that could finally bring down Boss Sam, the moles inadvertently become aware of each other's existence, and each is left wondering who is on the inside. What follows is a unique and exciting twist on the classic cat and mouse chase in which each man is not fighting for his life, but for his anonymity. In addition to its plot twists, what liftsInfernal Affairsabove the standard cop story is its subtle exploration of the relative nature of good and evil. Part action, part psychological examination,Infernal Affairsis a sharp and fresh take on the classic crime story, and the inspiration for a 2006 Martin Scorsese remake (The Departed). Not to be missed.--Rob Bracco", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000KX0IMC", "B000KX0IMM", "B000N4SHNK", "B0004Z302Q", "B0036BDQBU", "B00B6OEE7O", "B004H2CXBQ", "6305972532", "B000R7HXZQ", "B0009S2T0M", "B005ZMBEXU", "B00HSJ2EMI", "B000065V38", "B00C6WHPO4", "B000HC2M3Y", "B005HG8VE4", "B000GFLKDU", "B00J5LXST0", "B004SIP88Y", "B0018PH3NS", "B0010X7432", "B008XEZXES", "B0007Q6VXC", "B000R7HY2I", "B00003CXUM", "B004SIP6GI", "B003EVAG4C", "B000M341QE", "B000UAE7M2", "B001MYIXAC", "B00J5LXQKQ", "B0030A6ICG", "B00ET2ODYY", "B002C6VMIY", "B00AN5LCV8", "B00008R9LX", "B001F0TM3A", "B005FQ1OOK", "B000WGZGOC", "B000KX0IMW", "B006C1S1DY", "B000BRBA8S", "B000NVT0RK", "B00005JKG1", "B003INBNXO", "B000I0RNWU", "B000GSYRY6", "B0013D8LCM", "B005F96UGO", "B001O7SWHG", "B0010X741O", "B000MM0LEG", "B0085A9J18", "B00DSQTMRA", "B0056OZI0W", "B00C3ALL9O", "B000MM0LF0", "B00004W457", "B008WAM36O", "B00H47IXJW", "B0036TGSJE", "B00CG0YLS4", "B004I1AGTC", "B006L4MWVE", "B00003CXR4", "B0019PL2W0", "B00AN5LCOA", "B00006ADES", "B0010SAGHS", "B0010X740K", "B0009XRZQK", "B00002RAPT", "B000EE3FUY", "B009VL2AZM", "B003G715IK", "B00G3HOJZ6", "B009VL2A5M", "B0087OULO6", "B005F96UHI", "B000006A17", "B008U1ANCG", "B002ZPIBRC", "B00ENTX7JU", "B001BEK8E2", "B0076XTIWU", "B008IG0B0C", "B000Q7ZKWK", "B0056OZI0M", "B00AWHDEIQ", "B00BTFK014", "B00005YUNV", "B000E0OE44", "B003DVB7F0", "B002P7UCJK", "B005ZMBEXA", "B005M9VSMI", "6305081034", "B0040QYRTA", "B00772HQTC", "B0058M0848"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000N4SHNK", "B0036BDQBU", "B0085A9J18", "B004H2CXBQ"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 112979}, "asin": "B00005JN7C", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51YGGXV9AJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Infernal Affairs (Wu jian dao)"}
{"description": "Like any DVD blockbuster from producer Jerry Bruckheimer, the extras are plentiful and often a bit too self-congratulatory (worst offender here is the primary commentary track). The slickly (natch) produced making-of documentary goes through the standard routine; however, the less-flashy \"fly on the wall\" bits--just showing what happens on set without comment--is more fun, offering effortless insight on the filmmaking process. The best treasure is a nifty interactive history on pirates with plenty of background material. You can simply play the filmed segments or take a tour around a ship to discover the material (and a few surprises). There's a lot of archival material on the theme-park ride that inspired the film and several odds and ends including an enjoyable chronicle of the vintage ship's voyage from its home harbor to the movie set. The kids should really dig the DVD-ROM \"Moonlight Becomes Ye,\" in which they can turn their own mug into a ghostly pirate. There's also a bounty of extended and deleted scenes (19 in all) and a very funny blooper reel. With both DTS and Dolby 5.1, sound systems will get a workout with the excellent (and loud) sound design.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000I0RQVI", "B000U7WV1Y", "B005COPWZW", "B004A8ZWUQ", "B00005JN5E", "B0013BM63O", "B006VRRGNK", "B00005JKZV", "B00005JPH2", "B0014Z4OMU", "B00E5I2MCM", "B00003CWT6", "B004DTLK80", "B00005JKZY", "B0000A1RJI", "B004M1A21K", "B004DTLK7G", "B00003CXZ1", "B001HN694K", "B001E75QH0", "B00E5I2M6I", "B00005JKCH", "B0087ZG7HK", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B000E6EK2Y", "B000E8M0VA", "B003UYUQZW", "B00AEFYGBA", "B000W746GK", "B00005JMQW", "B0083SBMBM", "B001DHXT20", "B0002234LS", "B000W7F5SS", "B002PMV9FG", "B0002KVUKM", "B004EPYZUS", "B0053FANRC", "B00BEZTMFY", "6304806434", "B000VR0570", "0783231644", "B001OQCV6A", "B000AYELVA", "B008JFUO72", "B005G4TJUC", "B00004R99S", "B00023B1LC", "B00E5I2M9K", "B00003CXI1", "B001HQZJMU", "B00000IRE6", "B0002ZDVEU", "B008QE9XD2", "B00F84H73Q", "B00E5I2MEK", "B003Y5H5EW", "B007K3JFUQ", "B003QO8TOQ", "B000NQRR1Q", "B000YPUF9W", "B001EZE5BU", "B004A8ZWSS", "B0009MDPYM", "B00LG6YEKE", "B002ZG980U", "B002ZG994U", "B000U1ZV8K", "B001DZ8TRW", "B00005JLR2", "B000VWYJ86", "B00AZMFJYA", "B001GZ6QC4", "B00000JQB5", "B004XKCZAG", "B000W796OM", "B001GCUO0W", "B00AQSN7HE", "B00000ILDH", "B0053FANT0", "B0000VAFO0", "B0002IQMAM", "B000HRMAPE", "B004LWZW7Y", "B008UZA8FY", "B0001HLVS2", "B00007AJGH", "B00005JNJV", "B003YAR97K", "B00CHVJODE", "B000UR9T8C", "B0049IHX2C", "B000G6BLW4", "B00177YA1K", "0783227345", "B0014Z4ON4", "B001TK80C0", "B002O5M4T4", "B00AEBBA72", "B00005JOC9"], "bought_together": ["B000I0RQVI", "B000U7WV1Y"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005COPWZW", "B000I0RQVI", "B0071JADFU", "B00005JPFX"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 6260}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.23, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B00005JM5E", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51fX40gGdXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)"}

{"description": "Jamie Foxx's uncannily accurate performance isn't the only good thing aboutRay. Riding high on a wave of Oscar buzz, Foxx proved himself worthy of all the hype by portraying blind R&B; legend Ray Charles in a warts-and-all performance that Charles approved shortly before his death in June 2004. Despite a few dramatic embellishments of actual incidents (such as the suggestion that the accidental drowning of Charles's younger brother caused all the inner demons that Charles would battle into adulthood), the film does a remarkable job of summarizing Charles's strengths as a musical innovator and his weaknesses as a philandering heroin addict who recorded some of his best songs while flying high as a kite. Foxx seems to be channeling Charles himself, and as he did with the life of Ritchie Valens in La Bamba, director Taylor Hackford gets most of the period details absolutely right as he chronicles Ray's rise from \"chitlin circuit\" performer in the early '50s to his much-deserved elevation to legendary status as one of the all-time great musicians. Foxx expertly lip-syncs to Ray Charles' classic recordings, but you could swear he's the real deal in a film that honors Ray Charles without sanitizing his once-messy life.--Jeff ShannonMore on Ray CharlesModern Sounds in Country and Western Music(CD)The Genius of Ray Charles(CD)Ray Charles and Betty Carter--Dedicated to You(CD)Genius & Soul--The 50th Anniversary Collection(CD)Ray: A Tribute to the Movie, the Music, and the Man(book)More Albums by Ray Charles", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000E8QVWY", "B001P3SA94", "B00465I1CE", "B00005JKMQ", "6305428409", "B003BV8I3Q", "B00AEFXTKO", "B0002LE9HC", "B000BOH8X2", "B00AEFYG3S", "0790739313", "B000JJSL1W", "B000A50460", "B00005TQ44", "0783230524", "B0009R1TJ0", "0780627822", "B00AEFZ63M", "B000P0J092", "B002VWNICM", "B00EV4EUT8", "B000JLTRH2", "B000N6U0E2", "B0041QSZS8", "0783237367", "078324228X", "B00AEFY6TW", "B003HKN534", "B00BTYPWDQ", "B00G4Q3KOC", "B00007AJG1", "B00007L4KF", "B00ANDDBBY", "B000BITV9W", "0783114907", "B00007AJG2", "1558908390", "B00005JLRZ", "B000FVQLQQ", "6305692572", "0767821637", "B002CA68NO", "B00AFEXRME", "B002CPMB9O", "B004SIP93S", "B000063JDI", "B00005NB8K", "B00125WAWS", "6305505780", "B000IFRT4W", "B001TUZGPO", "B009NNM9OA", "B000RB6XG2", "B000P0J0CY", "B0001FR3IQ", "B000FVQLRA", "B00066FAVW", "B002XMGGK6", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00DW5IL2E", "B00005JPK8", "0767811070", "B000I0QL7I", "B000069I0E", "B00080ZG10", "0306814315", "B000P0J0EM", "B00AEFXP8K", "B00049QQHI", "B00000JGHV", "B0007CEXYK", "B0001Q4BOE", "B0000YEE6M", "B000NIVJF4", "B008Y1YJN6", "B00066VTU8", "B001132GNY", "B0006QAIG4", "B0034G4OSG", "B000C20VRS", "0800141741", "B00A2H9QN8", "B000Y11B8K", "B00005LB86", "B000056VP4", "B00005JL72", "B000095J01", "B000Q7ZNZ4", "B002CAWNEM", "B003UESJHO", "B00066FAQW", "0783230389", "B0013FDM7E", "B00007ELEO", "B00AMEZDJW", "B000P0J0CE", "B003Y5H4ZC", "0767821955", "B00003GPFT", "B0021L8V2A"], "bought_together": ["B000E8QVWY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0002LE9HC", "B000E8QVWY", "B000BOH8X2", "B00AZMFJYA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 17277}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.89, "brand": "Universal Studios", "asin": "B00005JND5", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41RQ8ETK19L._SX300_.jpg", "title": "Ray (Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "Nearly 20 years after riding his last Crusade, Harrison Ford makes a welcome return as archaeologist/relic hunter Indiana Jones inIndiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, an action-packed fourth installment that's, in a nutshell, less memorable than the first three but great nostalgia for fans of the series. Producer George Lucas and screenwriter David Koepp (War of the Worlds) set the film during the cold war, as the Soviets--replacing Nazis as Indy's villains of choice and led by a sword-wielding Cate Blanchett with black bob and sunglasses--are in pursuit of a crystal skull, which has mystical powers related to a city of gold. After escaping from them in a spectacular opening action sequence, Indy is coerced to head to Peru at the behest of a young greaser (Shia LaBeouf) whose friend--and Indy's colleague--Professor Oxley (John Hurt) has been captured for his knowledge of the skull's whereabouts. Whatever secrets the skull holds are tertiary; its reveal is the weakest part of the movie, as the CGI effects that inevitably accompany it feel jarring next to the boulder-rolling world of Indy audiences knew and loved. There's plenty of comedy, delightful stunts--ants play a deadly role here--and the return ofRaiderslove interest Karen Allen as Marion Ravenwood, once shrill but now softened, giving her ex-love bemused glances and eye-rolls as he huffs his way to save the day. Which brings us to Ford: bullwhip still in hand, he's a little creakier, a lot grayer, but still twice the action hero of anyone in film today. With all the anticipation and hype leading up to the film's release, perhaps no reunion is sweeter than that of Ford with the role that fits him as snugly as that fedora hat.--Ellen A.

{"description": "You know you're going to get a different kind of superhero when you cast Robert Downey Jr. in the lead role. AndIron Manis different, in welcome ways. Cleverly updated from Marvel Comics' longstanding series,Iron Manputs billionaire industrialist Tony Stark (that's Downey) in the path of some Middle Eastern terrorists; in a brilliantly paced section, Stark invents an indestructible suit that allows him to escape. If the rest of the movie never quite hits that precise rhythm again, it nevertheless offers plenty of pleasure, as the renewed Stark swears off his past as a weapons manufacturer, develops his new Iron Man suit, and puzzles both his business partner (Jeff Bridges in great form) and executive assistant (Gwyneth Paltrow). Director Jon Favreau geeks out in fun ways with the hardware, but never lets it overpower the movie, and there's always a goofy one-liner or a slapstick pratfall around to break the tension. As for Downey, he doesn't get to jitterbug around too much in his improv way, but he brings enough of his unpredictable personality to keep the thing fresh. And listen up, hardcore Marvel mavens: even if you know the Stan Lee cameo is coming, you won't be able to guess it until it's on the screen. It all builds to a splendid final scene, with a concluding line delivery by Downey that just feels absolutely right.--Robert HortonStills fromIron Man(Click for larger image)&nbsp;", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00E5I2M6I", "B008JFUO72", "B001DHXT20", "B00E5I2M9K", "B00E5I2MEK", "B0083SBMBM", "B008JFUS0U", "B001CDR1FG", "B00E5I2MAO", "B004LWZWFQ", "B001GCUO1Q", "B008JFUPFI", "B000VI70QS", "B000HEVZ9E", "B0000959N0", "B00005JKCH", "B00005JNJV", "B00005JNTU", "B0090SI56Y", "B000VR0570", "B00005JMQW", "B002HWRYJE", "B0007P0Y7C", "B004LWZW42", "B00D7OMNXS", "B001OQCV6A", "B007K3JFUQ", "B004EPZ07K", "B004LWZWGA", "B000UR9T8C", "B0083SBJXS", "B0060FXDCG", "B002IPFWTE", "B00E5I2ME0", "B00IXD2MGQ", "B000AYELVA", "B00C6B8TB8", "B008QZ5PY2", "B000OVLBF8", "B000AYELVU", "B00AZMFJYA", "B001QB9H1U", "B009JBWOU0", "B001AK3S4Y", "B001GZ6QC4", "B005G4TJUC", "B002NXSRVG", "B000HCO83Q", "B003YOZNBU", "B003Q6D2B4", "B00023B1LC", "B0002IQMAM", "B008JFURII", "B00HERGM86", "B00E5I2MDQ", "B006VRRGNK", "B002ZG99QS", "B00000JQB5", "B007REV4T8", "B00008G8M5", "B008Y1YK9Y", "B0002ZDVEU", "6305718954", "B001DTPZNY", "B005LAIGW8", "B001F7MSFM", "B001GCUNWQ", "B00A2H9P98", "B000RW3VDE", "B002O5M4T4", "B00005JA8B", "B005LAIIPS", "B005LAII44", "B00BEIYHO2", "B000GUJZ00", "B00005N5S5", "B002SJIO4A", "B000VWYJ86", "B004EPZ0BG", "B0049IHX2C", "B00AEBBAEK", "B00005JM5E", "B008JFUOWM", "B000FS9FCG", "B00005PJ6N", "B00979KQFO", "B00AEFXKUI", "B002K0WBXW", "B0042U94UQ", "B004EPYZUS", "B008JFUQZ2", "B0084IG8TM", "B001DJLD1M", "B008JFUS5A", "B00006HBUJ", "B000J103OI", "B00F84H73Q", "B0087ZG7NO", "B000U1ZV8K"], "bought_together": ["B00E5I2M6I", "B008JFUO72"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B008JFUO72", "B00E5I2M6I", "B001DHXT20", "B00E5I2MEK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 12121}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.99, "brand": "DOWNEY,ROBERT JR.", "asin": "B00005JPS8", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515wjJQt2nL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Iron Man (Ultimate 2 Disc Edition)"}
{"description": "Here's hoping James Mangold's big, raucous, and ultrabloody remake of3:10 to Yumaleads some moviegoers to check outDelmer Daves's beautifully lean, half-century-old original. That classic Western spun a tale of captured outlaw Ben Wade (Glenn Ford)--deadly but disarmingly affable--and the small-time rancher and family man, Dan Evans (Van Heflin), desperate enough to accept the job of helping escort the badman to Yuma prison. Wade, knowing that his gang will be along at any moment to spring him, works at persuading the ultimately lone deputy to accept a bribe, turn his back on \"duty,\" and go home safe and rich to his family. That the outlaw has come to admire his captor intriguingly complicates the suspense.All of the above applies in the new3:10, but it takes a lot more huffing and puffing to get Wade (Russell Crowe this time) and Evans (Christian Bale) into position for the showdown. Mostly, more is less. To Mangold's credit, his movie doesn't traffic in facile irony or postmodern detachment; it aims to be a straight-up Western and deliver the excitement and charisma the genre's fans are starved for. But recognizing that contemporary viewers might be out of touch with the bedrock simplicity and strength of the genre--not to mention its code of honor--Mangold has supplied both Evans and Wade with a plethora of backstory and \"motivations.\" At the overblown action climax, the crossfire of personal agendas is almost as frenetic as the copious gunplay. (By that point the movie has killed more people than the Lincoln County War.)Best thing about the remake is Russell Crowe's Ben Wade, a Scripture-quoting career villain with an artist's eye and a curiously principled sense of whom and when to murder. As his second-in-command, Ben Foster fairly pirouettes at every opportunity to commit mayhem, and Peter Fonda contributes a fierce portrait of an old Wade adversary turned bounty hunter for the Pinkerton detective agency.--Richard T.

{"description": "For anyone who thought the Oscar-winning documentaryMarch of the Penguinswas the most marvelous cinematic moment for these nomads of the south, you haven't seen nothing yet.Happy Feetis an animated wonder about a penguin named Mumble who can't sing, but can dance up a storm. George Miller, the driving force behind theBabe(andMad Max) movies, takes another creative step in family entertainment with this big, beautiful, music-fueled film that will have kids and their parents dancing in the streets. From his first moment alive, Mumble (voiced Elijah Woods) feels the beat and can't stop dancing. Unfortunately, emperor penguins are all about finding their own heart song, and the dancing youngster--as cute as he is--is a misfit. Luckily, he bumps into little blue penguins and a Spanish-infused group (led by Robin Williams) and begins a series of adventures. Miller has an exceptional variety of entertainment: Busby Berkley musical numbers, amusement-park thrills, exciting chase sequences (seals and orca lovers might like think otherwise), and even an environmental message that doesn't weigh you down. Best of all, you don't know where the movie is going in the last act, a rare occurrence these days in family entertainment. A fusion of rock songs, mashed-up and otherwise, are featured; this movie is as much a musical as a comedy. Mumble's solo dance to a new version of Stevie Wonder's \"I Wish\" by Fantasia, Patti, and Yolanda may be the most joyful moment on camera in 2006.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0006UEVT0", "B001DPHDCY", "B0006JMLRK", "B0012EM5D8", "B004HO6I4M", "B004EPZ0AC", "B002WJI2QQ", "B000AY74OG", "B0000AOX0O", "B00BG0RSJ4", "B00005JNQS", "B000RMJ4F8", "B0000640SC", "B005SDUV4E", "0783231474", "B00003CXJ4", "B00CWM58WY", "B0000VV4W2", "B0042U94UQ", "B0039N74CW", "6305161887", "B00AEFXMSS", "B000M343BC", "B00007LVCM", "B001ECQ75A", "B00005JNS0", "B00000JL8E", "B000GUJZ00", "B000056H26", "B008NNY9QW", "B004EPZ034", "B00G5G7EXY", "B000LPS2VI", "B005LAIH4A", "B00F522C7C", "B005LAIISA", "B00GDT5T9Y", "B007FF3HQM", "B000VBJEEG", "B003H9M1Q2", "B00029LO0Y", "B008JFUQ16", "B00005JMQZ", "B00EV1YZ96", "B000ION23A", "B0013FSL3E", "B003ZHVJGO", "B002ZG97YM", "B001NCDFTW", "B004G600A4", "B00009YXAW", "B005LAIHW2", "B00AFEX83C", "B00475B0H6", "B000UVKGPI", "B00ALMNCLQ", "B00HLTD2OE", "B00005JM7T", "B001HN6922", "B000BI5KV0", "B0013FSWT2", "B0030IIZ4M", "B004ODLUGM", "B001GCUO7A", "B005F96UJ6", "B000UFIYOO", "B000G75AZC", "B00005QFE1", "B0000VCZKW", "B00IEXX4KS", "B001THIQFO", "B000A2WAQK", "B001GCUNWQ", "B00B7EQPNE", "B002NZK5SW", "B0007PIDBQ", "B00AOCDDGC", "B000V5IP6U", "B0044RFTD8", "B00AEFXMGU", "B001KVZ6FW", "B00CHVJODE", "B000CZ0PT4", "B006JD48LO", "B0007Z0NYG", "B00EBBGLFC", "B00003CXB4", "B000BMGEJI", "B008YWY0HK", "B0002YLCOM", "B00E9ZATJO", "B004A8ZX3C", "B00I6JOD2S", "B005G3VCYY", "B00CQRN3QI", "B004OWQTZ0", "B0001OGUQI", "B004EPZ01G", "B00005JMFH", "B000GIXEWC"], "bought_together": ["B004HO6I4M"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004HO6I4M", "B00EBBGLFC", "B00G5G7EXY", "B00HR3D56O"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 21763}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.51, "brand": "Warner", "asin": "B00005JPCF", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51sX2Hrdz6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Happy Feet (Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "The Dark Knightarrives with tremendous hype (best superhero movie ever? posthumous Oscar for Heath Ledger?), and incredibly, it lives up to all of it.  But calling it the best superhero movie ever seems like faint praise, since part of what makes the movie great--in addition to pitch-perfect casting, outstanding writing, and a compelling vision--is that it bypasses the normal fantasy element of the superhero genre and makes it all terrifyingly real.  Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) is Gotham City's new district attorney, charged with cleaning up the crime rings that have paralyzed the city. He enters an uneasy alliance with the young police lieutenant, Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman), and Batman (Christian Bale), the caped vigilante who seems to trust only Gordon--and whom only Gordon seems to trust. They make progress until a psychotic and deadly new player enters the game: the Joker (Heath Ledger), who offers the crime bosses a solution--kill the Batman. Further complicating matters is that Dent is now dating Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal, after Katie Holmes turned down the chance to reprise her role), the longtime love of Batman's alter ego, Bruce Wayne.In his last completed role before his tragic death, Ledger is fantastic as the Joker, a volcanic, truly frightening force of evil. And he sets the tone of the movie: the world is a dark, dangerous place where there are no easy choices.  Eckhart and Oldman also shine, but as good as Bale is, his character turns out rather bland in comparison (not uncommon for heroes facing more colorful villains). Director-cowriter Christopher Nolan (Memento) follows his critically acclaimedBatman Beginswith an even better sequel that sets itself apart from notable superhero movies likeSpider-Man 2andIron Manbecause of its sheer emotional impact and striking sense of realism--there are no suspension-of-disbelief superpowers here. At 152 minutes, it's a shade too long, and it's much too intense for kids. But for most movie fans--and not just superhero fans--The Dark Knightis a film for the ages.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B00DUCXFUC", "B004LWZWGK", "B000PC6A3E", "B002ZG981E", "B00G4RD4PQ", "B0039208QM", "B001GMALGY", "B00E2Y0YBK", "B00C2IGQBA", "B0039208JE", "B00H14WTLQ", "B0039208CG", "B0085D3I3K", "B0039208C6", "B000M5AJQI", "B00319ECGK", "B001FB55H6", "B00EIG5M5A", "7020070078", "B00E2Y6AUY", "B00D5FMGGS", "B001OQCV6K", "B0013FBS20", "B000Q6GX5Y", "B001GKJ2FC", "B00FPS79F6", "B001992NUQ", "B004JMSIRC", "B001RIY4WE", "B00DYEN6XC", "B008QZ5PY2", "B001F7MSG6", "B00FAHYNWE", "B00J7PRJXU", "B001AQT0Z4", "B001UV4XEW", "B0083SBJXS", "B00AEFY552", "B00C8RD79O", "B007KAJG3K", "B007L4HET8", "B004EPZ07U", "B007L4HFDI", "B00AEFXKOO", "B000PC0U1W", "B00C6B8TB8", "B00HINFI4K", "B003TT2X6I", "B001KZIRM2", "B002ZG99NG", "B00EZ4M68G", "B004SIP90G", "B003ZHR6RK", "B001GCUO16", "B003TT2X6S", "B00JNEWSLS", "B001F3FUK6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00DUCXFUC", "B004LWZWGK", "B002ZG981E", "B000PC6A3E"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "asin": "B00005JPY0", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51pGxSkkz4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Dark Knight [Theatrical Release]"}

Baker and star Jim Carrey are such interesting personalities that their stories about the time-consuming process are entertaining. For the kids, Max's Playhouse has some simple games and three sing-alongs. How interesting you find the rest of the extras will depend on how much you liked the film. An unhosted segment on deleted scenes is nothing special, and the segment on how the movie extras, including members of the Cirque de Soleil, worked on their bits could have been far longer.

{"description": "Retelling a story that has made it onto the silver screen more than most, this latest adaptation of The Count of Monte Cristo makes yet another swashbuckling attempt to win over a new generation of cinema goers. A dashing James Caviezel takes the role of the Count, who is driven by a desire for revenge after being betrayed by his best friend Fernand (played by a dishevelled Guy Pearce) and landed with 16 years of solitary confinement in Chateau D'If, a damp cavernous prison. Thus the scene is set for a good old-fashioned romp. The trouble with this \"re-imagining\" (to borrow a phrase from Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes) is that it's never quite sure whether to take itself seriously or not. Alexandre Dumas's original story is a traditionally melodramatic tale of deceit and double-crossing, with clear-cut bad guys and a moral lesson to be learned at the end. Here, director Kevin Reynolds appears unsure about whether to stick with tradition or bring the story up to date and turn it into a post-modern play on the old Victorian values and style. When the Count and his heavy-breathing loved one are reunited, their kiss is actually framed as a cameo. Both lead actors are also prone to heavy bouts of overacting, garnishing their performances with exaggerated baroque gestures. Clearly this is a film in which the actors could over-indulge themselves and (almost) get away with it, were it not for the fact that--bar Richard Harris as the \"Priest\"--none of them seem to have the faintest idea about how to conduct themselves in a period drama. This Count of Monte Cristo will leave the audience a little confused as to whether they should cry along with the story or laugh along with the actors. --Nikki Disney On the DVD: The Count of Monte Cristo on disc offers no escape from the dry drawl of director Kevin Reynolds, who features in almost every element of the extensive extras package. With a shy studio disclaimer before his commentary, he's got a refreshingly frank attitude to", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792839137", "6305428077", "B001EAWMGA", "B000U34PM6", "B000CEXGAU", "B00DCRE87O", "B000ARXF96", "B00004YA66", "B0002HOEPI", "B000BFJM26", "B002U0KHNS", "B00BC0JGUW", "B00005NRO0", "B0064MT1L2", "B000A50442", "B000HC2LZS", "1411469488", "B002AK9URM", "076781505X", "0140449264", "B0007N19X2", "B002VWNID6", "0800141601", "B00062IVOY", "0822003260", "B0002235R6", "B000ENC5YW", "B000P0J0EW", "B00006ZXSO", "B000056PMU", "9626340398", "B00AEFYUQQ", "B000056VP4", "B00CHMBQM0", "B005S9EK5Y", "B001ECDVJU", "B000NVT0SO", "B0001NBMEE", "B00006L949", "B00AEFYO5I", "B0002TSZI8", "B00005LOL0", "B0002YLCG0", "B004SIP75S", "B00081U7HC", "B00004TJJV", "0553213504", "B004SIP9RO", "6304765266", "6304711905", "B00096S4DK", "B0006N2EZ0", "B002K0WBXW", "B000093FLA", "B00AEBB8YW", "B00AEFZ2DG", "B00006ZXSK", "B006P0FIGU", "B002GHHHJC", "0783222149", "B00005JM5B", "B000YGDNPO", "B004IK30MI", "B00096S49Y", "B00860YICC", "6304711891", "B00006ZXSI", "B000FVQLQQ", "B00005JMOW", "B00866JL96", "B000LP6KNU", "B00005PJ8T", "B00004WG2F", "B00000G3PA", "6305428115", "6305692688", "B000E1ZBGS", "B001ECDVK4", "B00000F4ZY", "B00AEFXESQ", "B00028HBKM", "B0041SI78O", "B000BITVBA", "B00003CXFV", "B004SIP7ZS", "B001E75QH0", "6305213283", "6305416222", "B00066FB52", "B0034G4P94", "B00AEBB9NM", "B000P0J0DS", "B00DHHWXYY", "6305127646", "6305236569", "B009LDD1H6", "6305128952", "B00005ATZT", "B0074JOUHE", "6304698798"], "bought_together": ["0792839137", "6305428077"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0792839137", "0140449264", "B000CEXGAU", "B000U34PM6"]}, "price": 12.5, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 231677}, "asin": "B000063W1R", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51LYMHVq8EL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Count of Monte Cristo [Region 2]"}

This slow-burning, complicated, and ultimately rewarding BBC adaptation, dramatized by Arthur Hopcroft and directed by John Irvin, perfectly captures Le Carr&#xE9;'s own insight into the shady underworld of spies and the political climate during the cold war.Le Carr&#xE9;'s style is the antithesis of his contemporary Ian Fleming's--far from the glamorous lifestyle ofJames Bond, with his fast cars and faster women, these agents ride around in Skodas, and Beryl Reid is the closest thing to a femme fatale, save for Smiley's elusive wife, Anne. An extraordinary cast (including Ian Bannen, Hywel Bennett, and Ian Richardson), gritty realism, and close attention to detail makeTinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spyan outstanding piece of television drama.--Nicola Perry", "related": {"also_bought": ["B005DXCOKS", "B0059XTTW8", "B00007LV9M", "B001EOQCJE", "B00061QJ8A", "B009Z59ZNE", "B000E1ZB9U", "B001LMAK6A", "B000742FZW", "B00005R5GM", "B002EAYE42", "B000HT3PBU", "B0011VJRVU", "014311977X", "B000YRY8BG", "B00000K3C9", "B00A8KJLPM", "014312093X", "B001LXIDUO", "B0000C23D5", "B008I34YTY", "0783226853", "B009DS6YGO", "B004IFYN1A", "0143119737", "B00JJRLFTU", "0517146975", "B003YCI1UC", "B006JY3OHW", "B007G5K066", "B00FNR9ZKG", "B003JLL2R2", "B00BCXW106", "B000MXPE7O", "B005CW117C", "B0002HOERQ", "B0028AEO0M", "B00H4ZEFTQ", "B00D7AM2PQ", "B00GD7UO6E", "B00CWEPZUC", "B00HUAGYF8", "B0050N0US4", "B000UEE6TC", "B00BDSRM4K", "B008RO6PJQ", "B00BEZEDNU", "B005DJ7AYC", "B009DS3VQA", "B00003CXWG", "B00GWXI1F0", "B00ANGICCO", "B000AOEMUU", "B00D7AM2YW", "B00HHYF548", "B003X2P9B2", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B00000K0DR", "B00441GYYC", "B00GAXASK8", "B008OTTTP6", "B00A27O5AW", "B009DS31ZG", "B0028LOT7O", "B005A1GRSI", "B009YX8MKO", "B000RPCJB6", "B00C888LOO", "B00J5LXT44", "B004OB2EYQ", "B000PFUAPK", "B005N8KP3Q", "B00HHYF5DE", "B00IT3KP96", "B00GHH9I62", "B00A0HT99G", "B000IJ7AEC", "B00199PPCO", "B00B5A9FNM", "B00FPPQYXM", "0143119761", "B008CYDDRS", "B004O0CJYM", "B0083HXKAY", "B00008DP4B", "0743287207", "B004TPJN2S", "B000C65Z1G", "B001ROVUTI", "B00662CH02", "B0001DMUF4", "B0070MZ0G0", "B00008DDXE", "B00BC5I6Q2", "B00HGE90Z4", "B001CQONHM", "B00BOTCJXC", "B002XTBEDS", "B00ECXJC1E"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0059XTTW8", "B001EOQCJE", "B005DXCOKS", "B009Z59ZNE"]}, "price": 30.49, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 22529}, "asin": "B00006A8T4", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51CWDFV79SL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"}

{"description": "The Good Fairyis an amusing minor specimen of the sort of Continental whimsy Ernst Lubitsch raised to a fine art. William Wyler, though soon to acquire major-director status, displays little affinity for comedy, and, title notwithstanding, the often-magical Margaret Sullavan is notably less magical than in her other '30s efforts (she and Wyler had a great love-hate thing going during filming, and eloped on his motorcycle right afterward). The real stars are screenwriter Preston Sturges and the breed of exuberant character actors with whom he would make manically beautiful music upon turning director himself: Reginald Owen, Eric Blore, Torben Meyer, Luis Alberni, et al. Herbert Marshall sporadically brings a Lubitschean delicacy to his role as the struggling lawyer who doesn't know he's \"married\" to Sullavan's sweetly balmy movie usherette (it's a long story), and Frank Morgan, as a plutocrat who desperately wants to play the rou&#xE9;, is really the Wizard of Oz in training.--Richard T.

{"description": "Released in 1943 by the low-budget outfit Producers Releasing Corporation,The Black Ravenoffers what amounts to a watered-down \"old dark house\" mystery. George Zucco is in top form as Amos Bradford, the criminal owner of the Black Raven Inn. When a nearby bridge is washed out in a raging storm, the usual assortment of characters is forced to spend the night at the Black Raven. Not surprisingly, murder and mystery soon follow.While falling back on many clich&#xE9;s of the genre, the film also has much to recommend it. The spooky lighting and sporadically noir-like photography manage to hit a few high points, and the murder mystery is moderately engaging. The weather effects are surprisingly good (you'll really believe the actors are caught in a downpour!).--Mark Savary", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00007G1TI", "B000E991DE", "B00006AUGT", "B0000AGWK2", "B000WNHTCC", "B005ETAN7C", "B0058K88K6", "B00DE1LD6W", "B000JU8HB0", "B00008AOV5", "B00CDV4OEC", "B00009NH8D", "B00008G8WT", "B001BSBBMQ", "B003IRUFBG", "B0085A9IWS", "B000098ZRQ", "B002TCRQRC", "B0001ZMXAE", "B00009NHAW", "B00008J2F6", "B00009NH8I", "B000REWYYY", "B000641ZV8", "B0001MZ818", "B00009NH9R", "B0015ESZ8O", "B0000AGWMV", "B00006II53", "B00006II52", "B00082ZRA8", "B001MEJXVU", "B008BJTZ62", "B00007G1TF", "B001PPGAN0", "B004CZZZ0O", "B0013XZ756", "B0007OP1D0", "B009AGEWYA", "B000CEVCD8", "B000SSONFC"], "bought_together": ["B00007G1TI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00000ILEU", "B00007G1TI", "B000FWHW90"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 136775}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.98, "brand": "Alpha Video Distributors", "asin": "B00006SFIW", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HCWB7YZDL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Black Raven"}

{"description": "To the ranks of shows too brilliant and outrageous for prime time (The Ben Stiller Show,Andy Richter Controls the Universe), add Seth McFarlane'sFamily Guy. This animated series, which debuted after the 1999 Super Bowl, simply sparked too much controversy and offended too many sensibilities to survive (Entertainment Weeklydubbed it \"the Awful Show They Just Keep Putting on the Air\"). That the Fox network also played hackysack with its schedule, ensuring viewers would not be able to find it, sealed its fate (it was cancelled in 2002). This boxed set containing all 28 episodes from the first two seasons is payback for the show's devoted cult following, who may be moved to echo the words of infant Stewie Griffin, the megalomaniacal 1-year-old bent on matricide and world domination: \"Victory is mine!\"The dysfunctional Griffins of Quahog, Rhode Island, invite comparisons toThe Simpsons. The testicular-chinned father, Peter Griffin, is a clueless oaf in the Homer mold. \"Peter, what did you promise me last night?\" asks his long-suffering wife Lois in one episode. \"That I wouldn't drink at the stag party,\" he replies. \"And what did you do?\" she asks. \"Drank at the stag part--oh ho ho, I almost walked into that one,\" he cackles. Other family members include teenage daughter Meg, a desperate high school social pariah; 13-year-old son Chris, a chip off his father's blockhead; and Brian, the family's sarcastic talking dog. But this series' true inspiration is football-pated Stewie (voiced by McFarlane, who earned an Emmy), who was born to be a Bond villain once he escaped his mother's \"ovarian bastille.\"Family Guyrecklessly ventured whereThe Simpsonsfeared to tread. In one episode, Meg's one and only friend turns out to be the member of a suicidal cult. In another, Death (voiced by Norm McDonald) becomes an unwanted houseguest. Each episode plays fast and furious with surreal flashes (in one episode, Peter turns his house into a puppet) and pop-culture references and TV, movie, and commercial parodies that invite repeated viewings.

{"description": "Bent on enslaving an entire land of nursery-rhyme characters (to mine  diamonds!), the dastardly Count Warptwist sneers and chortles his crooked way  throughThe Wacky World of Mother Goose. According to Arthur Rankin Jr.  and Jules Bass (famed creators ofRudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer), such  can be expected when Mother Goose leaves King Cole in charge while she visits  her ailing sister. Contorted as it sounds, the premise allows Rankin and Bass to  concoct possible backstories on literary curiosities like Little Jack Horner,  Peter Pumpkin-eater's wife, and the dish who ran away with the spoon. It also  means an eclectic soundtrack, frequent eyebrow-raising lyrics not meant for the  preschool set, and an occasional nursery rhyme belted out by a resounding, Ray  Conniff-esque chorus. Digital remastering for the DVD edition restores wide-awake colors, an odd juxtaposition to the sleepy characters first conceptualized  by legendary artist Paul Coker Jr. (MAD Magazine).

{"description": "Delenn's future love interest, Captain John Sheridan (Bruce Boxleitner) arrived onBabylon 5in the first episode of season 2, \"Points of Departure.\" The show marked the handing over of command ofB5to Sheridan from Commander Jeffery Sinclair, actor Michael O'Hare becoming a victim of studio politicians who wanted a bigger star in the leading role. This excellent installment also revealed more about why the Minbari surrendered to Earth at the Battle of the Line when they were on the verge of victory. \"Revelations\" explains that Sheridan's wife, Anna, died during an archaeological survey of the world Z'ha'dum, the name being just one of many references to Tolkien's the Lord of the Rings (the bridge at Khazad-Dum). \"The Geometry of Shadows\" introduced the Technomages, characters who featured more significantly in the ill-fated spinoff seriesCrusade(1999), while \"The Coming of Shadows\" proved to beBabylon 5's finest hour to date. The story of political intrigue foreshadowing the fate of two of the major characters beatApollo 13,Toy Story,12 Monkeys, andStar Trek: Deep Space Nineepisode \"The Visitor\" to win the Hugo award for Best Dramatic Presentation at the 1996 World Science Fiction Convention and proved so powerful that J. Michael Straczynski included it in hisComplete Book of Scriptwriting.\"And Now for a Word\" took the unusual step of presenting a day-in-the-life ofB5seen through the eyes of a TV news crew, just as the Narn declared war on the Centauri. The inclusion of a PSI-Corps commercial paid homage to Paul Verhoeven's satirical ads inRobocop(1987), while his laterStarship Troopers(1997) seemed at times like a spoof ofB5's earnest space opera. In \"In the Shadow of Z'ha'dum,\" Sheridan learns that Morden was on the ship on which Anna died; the episode sees the captain pushed to his limits by grief and determination to discover why Morden survived. Three exceptional shows conclude the season. The Narn-Centauri war escalates in \"The Long, Twilight Struggle,\" Sheridan faces a most unusual ordeal in \"Comes the Inquisitor,\" and in \"The Fall of Night\" all hope of peace is shattered as a nerve-racking assassination attempt reveals a startling secret about Ambassador Kosh.--Gary S.

{"description": "Is Duvinder guilty? Or is he innocent? Share the tension and the excitement as the jury decides.John Maher (Billy Scott) lay dead in the grass, the victim of 28 well-placed stab wounds. A stolen sword coated in blood lands near the 15-year-old schoolboy's body. It's clearly a case of unrestrained vengeance. John's Sikh schoolmate, Duvinder Singh (Sonnell Dadral), hated him. Hated him enough to commit murder. A horrendous, premeditated murder in cold blood. Or so we're told.We're also told this gentle, intelligent boy is incapable of killing. He's innocent. Chilling suspense fills \"The Jury\" as the highly publicized trial pits Sikh and Anglo communities against each other. Logic against intuition. Pride against shame. The jurors must decide what side they're on - both inside the courtroom, and outside.Award-winning actor Sir Derek Jacobi (Gosford Park; Gladiator; I, Claudius) stars as George Cording QC (queen's council). As Duvinder's lawyer, he must convince the jury of the young boy's innocence in the face of compelling evidence that suggests otherwise. Cording knows his only hope is to confront the evidence head on and expose a scathing case of prejudice. His powers of persuasion have never been sharper.Gerald Lewis QC (esteemed actor Sir Antony Sher, Shakespeare in Love, Alive & Kicking, Superman II) can be arrogant-he's entitled. After all, his witness saw blood on the accused's shirt. His witness saw an agitated Duvinder running away. His witness found the body. An impassioned relating of the events will certainly bring the guilty verdict Lewis demands.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000WP07F6", "B000G8P1Y6", "B0009PBLU4", "B000GIXEIG", "B00027NVXE", "B000V8VNUM", "B004R6VHQY", "B00007AJF4", "B00003CXSD", "B001M4YZ90", "B00KHA99BY", "B00AEBB8QK", "B0059XTUR2", "B000HRMATU", "B002ZG998G", "B001APZMJS", "B004XYOQU4", "B00A2H9UG6", "B005FITIDC", "6305505519", "B00009XN4C", "B00AEFYGBA", "B002SG7Z7A", "B002P413IC", "B002XMGGK6", "B00GD7UO6E", "B00JJRLFVS", "B00HV2BG44", "B00CBK6506", "B00006JDVV", "B000OY9V8Y", "B00AAQHP66", "B000QXDED6", "B00GTKYI1C", "B001H057T6", "B00INB7UT2", "B00007L4MO", "B00HYZ0ZLS", "B00HHYF5DE", "B0007TKNII", "B00BEIYHO2", "B00DDUF4G4", "B00C888LOO", "B00EBBGKTE", "B00BQXTCVS", "B00JJRLFTU", "B00JPNU8P0", "B00GWXI1F0", "B00D49YBTA", "B0006GANOQ", "B00DDUF4D2", "B00HGE90Z4", "B00GD7UMDO", "B00D49YE4W", "B000YAA68C", "B00ECXJC1E", "B0083HXKAY", "B008KEQM2S", "B000XBPDY4", "B003HDYOTU", "B005DVIOAO", "B00662CH02", "B000GW8U4A", "B00F988AV4", "B005K8QIS0", "B00D7AM2YW", "B006JY3OAE", "B00FRQ0HOQ", "B00HHYF55C", "B001FB55YE", "B00A27OJ94", "B00E3UN66I", "B0059XTUT0", "B008RO6PJQ", "B00127RAH6", "B00A27O5AW", "B00AQTY3XA", "B0046MOVE4", "B0050N0US4", "B00HOGBXS6", "B00AQYUY5Q", "B00B5A9FP0", "B00GAXASK8", "B00BQXTDIU", "B00D49YESS", "B00D09B3FE", "B00CLB7CFM", "B00023BKO0", "B008PDAG3K", "B009DS3VQA", "B00J5LXT44", "B00D49YEHO", "B00946G2YE", "B00D7AM2WO", "B00B62ER0U", "B00EF0NYVI", "B00D7AM2V0", "B00DW5IKWK", "B005JX89WY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0009PBLU4", "B000G8P1Y6", "B002P413IC", "B002XMGGK6"]}, "price": 34.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 154091}, "asin": "B00008DDVG", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/519T23P7FRL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Jury"}

{"description": "Since winning an Academy Award for his exuberant performance inJerry Maguire, Cuba Gooding Jr. has gotten little but static from critics for a spate of calamitous career choices not seen since '80s-vintage Burt Reynolds. But he triumphantly returns to Oscar-worthy status with his moving performance as Radio, a mentally challenged young man, whom South Carolina high school football coach Harold Jones (Ed Harris) takes under his nurturing wing. This does not play well with the school's patient but questioning principal (Alfre Woodard); the school's biggest athletic booster, who views Radio as a distraction; the man's son, the team's star player, who plays cruel pranks on the trusting Radio; and the Coach's teenage daughter, who feels neglected. Almost all will be won over by Radio's trusting and good nature. Based on aSports Illustratedstory,Radiowas adapted for the screen by Mike Rich, screenwriter ofThe Rookie, and as in that superior family film, the heroics are mostly off the field.

{"description": "TheIdentityDVD features are not quite as enticing as they sound.  Of chief interest is the extended branched version of the film (available in widescreen only), but there's only one added scene (an interesting but not critical minute-long sequence that would have been the first conference-room scene), and the differences in the alternate ending are so subtle that you'll miss them if you literally blink a few times.  There's no question it could affect audience perception, but unlike most alternate endings, it doesn't affect the actual outcome.  (Seespoilerfor more information.)  The four deleted scenes (which don't include either of the above-mentioned additions) aren't that exciting, and the optional director commentary notes that these deletions generally served to cut moments of character and comic relief in favor of moving the story along, which is one reason the film runs a brisk 90 minutes. James Mangold's director commentary on the feature is good, though, as he discusses such matters as the logistics of the perpetual downpour and a crucial bit of dialogue removed from the film's climax.  Considering that downpour and the contrasting darks and lights of the film, picture quality is good, and the thunder claps sound great in 5.1 sound so there are no complaints about the DVD's presentation of the film itself.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000TJ6PBK", "B00006AUJR", "B0009YA3OA", "B000DZ7YN8", "B00005JNY3", "B00AADAK5W", "1558908382", "B00008K77D", "B0002DB54A", "B000RGN2JI", "B00AEBB8NI", "B000P0I4O4", "B00003CXZ4", "B004ZNFTDQ", "B0015XHQVC", "B00026ZD04", "B00014NEZI", "B003LR5BD0", "B00092ZLSK", "B004SIP92O", "B00000JGHL", "B003VA3JUO", "B00BNH9NCU", "B00DZP1C2W", "B00I45844W", "B004YCKKFK", "B00011CZRE", "B0002234LS", "B001HVZOB6", "B005S9EJ8W", "B000A2UBN4", "B00HOGBXS6", "B000OYC7BW", "B0004Z31OS", "B00AEBB89W", "B00AEFXW8I", "B00009OWJY", "B002NZK5RI", "B00AEFXEGS", "B00007AJF8", "B003ASLJQ8", "B000R4SMCW", "B000069HZP", "B00003CXGA", "B00005V9HH", "B0001FR3IQ", "B00005JPT0", "B000SK5Z20", "B00008YJDK", "B0013D8LBS", "6305238065", "B0021L8UFI", "B004P7CN7W", "078322799X", "B001OQCV2E", "B0002WT4OE", "B00B6OEB18", "B00003CXKM", "B004SIP9RO", "B000RZIGUE", "B004B3PBFQ", "B004LWZW24", "B00AEFXT1S", "B00096S49Y", "B000LC55F2", "0783240295", "B00009L1TA", "B0034G4P30", "B002O3Z4WK", "B00005JLO8", "B001ILFUBE", "B00005JKIS", "B004SIP9MY", "6305718954", "B000ALM40I", "B0001Z52RU", "B0010X73ZG", "B000A5045Q", "B00005JMWP", "B00005JN2Z", "B000F5WR4W", "B0000648X0", "B0021L8UPS", "B00AEBBA2W", "6301971345", "B002UJIY7A", "B0006IIKQW", "B00B96TGQS", "B004BLJQOK", "B00AEFXKZ8", "6304806434", "B001NPD9LS", "B000U1ZV76", "B003L20IEW", "B00596WFE4", "B000GCFO0I", "B00005UQ9W", "B000053UIF", "B0000YTOL2"], "bought_together": ["B000TJ6PBK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000TJ6PBK", "B0012Q7M02", "B00006AUJR", "B00AEBBA2W"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 30202}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.73, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B00008EY9G", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RKTbv5kkL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Identity"}
{"description": "Season 2 ofFelicitynot only sees the massacre of star Keri Russell's golden locks (at one point, a minor character refers to the new, short-cropped Felicity as \"Chia-Head\") but endless turmoil--most of it quite addictive to watch--in perhaps seven or eight overlapping romances.First there's the issue of season 1's cliffhanger. Did Felicity spend her summer with former high-school crush Ben (Scott Speedman) or her dormitory's resident advisor, Noel (Scott Foley), who harbors strong feelings for her? Episode 1 teases us with the answer while laying the bumpy groundwork for our heroine's sophomore year: Felicity has come back to college in New York City as an R.A. in her old dorm, once again sharing a room--much to her discontent--with acerbic Wiccan-punk Meghan (Amanda Foreman). Ben has a part-time job working in a coffee shop owned by Felicity's confidante Javier (Ian Gomez). Noel is sharing an apartment with another Felicity ally, Elena (Tangi Miller), as well as filmmaker Sean (Greg Grunberg), who previously made a documentary focusing on Ben and Felicity's relationship.Tangled connections and shifting loyalties make for a long, involving second year in this drama-comedy from Disney and Imagine Entertainment. Characters fall in and out of love, earn and betray trust, leap before they look, and redeem themselves with powerful acts of forgiveness or faith.Felicitycreators J.J. Abrams (writer,Forever Young) and Matt Reeves (director,Relativity) set out to capture the unique contradictions of young adulthood in this show--in particular, clinging to a precise college track while trying to make sense of post-adolescent love and responsibility--and for the most part succeed very well. Sometimes too well: The storylines may become a little redundant, the drama a tad flat with such singular interest in the muddled passions of 19-year-olds. But each episode is sharply written, comically incisive, and never less than watchable.Great special features: Keri Russell's audition, audio commentaries, a never-before-seen pilot, and theFelicityEmmy Parody, i.e., a spoof of the TV show produced for an Emmy Award telecast.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0077PTWY6", "B00BGQ2NIO", "B00BGQ2NDO", "B0006J28DM", "B000TGURZ8", "B0001IN0T4", "B002KQ6UE2", "B000FUTVPA", "B00369ERC4", "B0056GLNQI", "B005CGI3ZG", "B0077PTX0E", "B0058EE6OO", "B0077PTWH8", "B0016OOM6W", "B004GJYRFA", "B0077PTWX2", "B003INBNV6", "B00BMKGZVA", "B001RHGRU2", "B0081QF6Q8", "B003R0MF6W", "B00127RAGM", "B00000IP8T", "B000F3UAE8", "B001ULCY48", "B001UHOWYM", "B000U1ZV2G", "B000LXH3SI", "B0009A407A", "B000NOKFGW", "B000BNXD6O", "B005DCJ0Q0", "B004MWLXTY", "B0001EQHXO", "B000N3T0EG", "B004WO9OMA", "B0011UBDS6", "B0030VANIU", "B00008AOX3", "B002ZTQW3S", "B00HEQOAIQ", "B0018CWF02", "B00ADQDTPE", "B001FB5TAY", "B003L77G56", "B00005JPII", "B003F3NE7K", "B00L9OPOSO", "B003L77G42", "B0018CWEVW", "B001VPJYZU", "B003LXM1PK", "B001OQCVCE", "B001DZOCVO", "B003QZSWRY", "B000P6YNT8", "B000R7HRRA", "B008L0YMWS", "B0058YPIF0", "B000065CVV", "B001RXDM2C", "B004M9ZI0C", "B002AK9UOK", "B00ECGHM5O", "B00A8KJN8M", "B003L77GCE", "B0050MB5P2", "B002AMVEEM", "B0006FFRBG", "B0024FAD7O", "B000FL7CAK", "B001CDKQ8K", "B00005JNAF", "B009LDD4V4", "B0041KKYI8", "B005CA4SOM", "B0007V6IW6", "B002KQ6UDS", "B0002234R2", "B000FS9MY2", "B0032UYFAQ", "B00CKJJ1G8", "B00DXLO086", "B000NA2BEU", "B00CKJJ1IG", "B00KM5F31O", "B00DXLO0D6", "B00B1LKXV8", "B00133QNS6", "B00561BNI6", "B000GFLEKY", "B001MVWRNE", "B004ZG5F0K", "B0002RQ3MK", "B000OCXNQW", "B002AMVEJ2", "B0051GOB2G", "B001MVYUP2", "B0031DMU5Q"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0077PTWY6", "B000TGURZ8", "B00369ERC4", "B00BMKGZVA"]}, "price": 1.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 148055}, "asin": "B00008GQ33", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51FR4M3NXRL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Felicity - Sophomore Year Collection (The Complete Second Season)"}
{"description": "Depending on how you liked this romantic comedy, you just might find more laughs in the delightful banter between the director and his two stars on the commentary track. Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant join writer-director Marc Lawrence for a lively 102 minutes of conversation. Not much movie magic is discussed, but the three talents will sacrifice all for a good joke. It's best to watch the commentary track with the \"Two Bleeps Notice\" viewing option: when a heart appears on-screen, you can immediately view outtakes from that stage of the film. The flubs, on-set antics, and jokes are all guaranteed to bring a laugh. Other extras include two additional scenes (the wedding finale was judicially cut) and a HBO puff-piece on the making of the film. Yet the disc is a must-have for any fan of Bullock or Grant because it offers a chance to listen in on them; they're just as charming off-screen as on.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002K0WBXW", "6304765266", "B000023VTP", "B00005JPE3", "B000YDBPAM", "B00AEBB8NS", "B000HEWEE4", "0783235380", "B00003CXSM", "B0009OL7Z4", "B0000897EG", "B00AEBB8YW", "B0007PLLBU", "B0021L8UZS", "B00006ZXSO", "B00AEFY99O", "B0000AOV4I", "B004SIP9RO", "B004SIP8JI", "B00007E2F5", "B002O3Z4ZW", "B00008G7UF", "B00006ZXSQ", "B0038N9X3Q", "B001ECDVK4", "B00006FMUW", "B00005JPSM", "B002NZK5V4", "B002ZG989G", "B000MQC9H4", "B00066FB2A", "B000CEV3M8", "B00000JGHN", "B00005JN3W", "B00005JG6N", "B00005JL7Q", "B002SYAGNC", "B00004UEDQ", "B000CCBCAS", "B00081U7HC", "B0015I2RT8", "B00068GTK6", "B000NA1WE0", "B0006GANOQ", "B002ZG988M", "B00006ZXSN", "B00AEBB9WI", "B005XB8SRS", "6305213283", "B0045HCJJ4", "B002ZG9968", "B00E8RKHWW", "B004SEUJK0", "B00006ZXSL", "B000A343RI", "B00AKGG6JS", "B0006A9FIM", "B00005O5CM", "B00AEFXWXI", "6305236569", "B00008G6E8", "B00AEFXYOA", "B004EPZ070", "B002VECM6S", "B002P413IC", "B00AEFYWQY", "B000QGDY0G", "B003B3V0N4", "B0013D8LHC", "0780625277", "B003Y5H574", "B0000VD02Y", "0767811100", "B00164X59M", "6305736685", "B001AKTZW8", "B001WAKOW6", "B00EP2SN58", "B00EIBO8T6", "B000XJD33O", "B000BNX3B4", "B00006ZXSK", "B004SIP8LG", "B00005JM55", "0767821769", "B004SIP9VA", "B00AEFYSEA", "B0009KA2OA", "B001C5LLQ4", "B00164KYV4", "B002NZK5R8", "B002NZK5VO", "B002NZK5RS", "B000683VI4", "0800141660", "B0002Y121K", "B0071HPOGK", "B00AEFXKUI", "B00006ZXSI", "B003Y5H524"], "bought_together": ["B002K0WBXW", "6304765266"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002K0WBXW", "B004SIP9RO", "6304765266", "B000023VTP"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 18204}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.56, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00008NRI7", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51VJyiu%2ByUL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Two Weeks Notice (Full-Screen Edition) (Snap Case)"}

{"description": "A ghostly romance from Australia. Guy Pearce is a brooding psychiatrist who must journey back to his family's summer home, to bury his father and settle some lingering childhood traumas. Helena Bonham Carter is the mysterious woman he meets on his journey, twice:  once in a fleeting encounter on a train, again as she takes a dive off a trestle into a river. By the way, she's amnesiac--Guy Pearce just can't shake thatMementofeel. For viewers susceptible to this kind of thing, director Michael Petroni's lofty literary tone might just work (the breathless pauses are broken by quotations from T.S. Eliot); otherwise, it will look like a skeletal take on a potentially interesting subject. The two fine actors give it a go, and they're always good to look at, but finally one wonders what they saw in this very slim proposition.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00080ZH0A", "B000JJ5G4W", "B005SW2RTC", "B000062WWZ", "B000065R16", "B00009ATK1", "0788815490", "B001V5K3AU", "B0002S94AM", "B007PXYV1O", "B005TMXZ3S", "B00004Z1G4", "B000E8JNQ0", "B0009X75J2", "B000A8AXXG", "B00005JKLZ", "B00019072G", "6305821216", "B002WY65VA", "B002BEJ3BA", "B000I2J6WI", "B00003CXZ4", "B002VWNICC", "B000C8Q91O", "B0000C2IQR", "B0001GOH6Q", "B00BBL2MA8", "B000A2GQ06", "B0000633TK"], "bought_together": ["B00080ZH0A", "B000JJ5G4W"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00080ZH0A", "B000JJ5G4W", "0788815490", "B0002S94AM"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 228462}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 30.09, "brand": "", "asin": "B00009N84E", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51PPFGTDD2L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Till Human Voices Wake Us"}

{"description": "It was a family affair in the second season of J.J. Abrams's wonderfully inventiveAlias, as super secret agent Sydney Bristow (Jennifer Garner) came face-to-face with the mother of all super secret agents--herownmother, Irina Derevko (Lena Olin), a former KGB agent presumed dead but alive and more dangerous than ever. After shooting poor Syd, Irina later shows up at the doorstep of the CIA, offering to turn herself in and work for the good guys. But can she be trusted?Aliasset up so much duplicity in its second season that it might have been hard to keep track of who was doing what to whom, but thanks to a great ensemble cast, fast-paced writing and direction, and some cannily cast guest stars,Aliasrode a stunning emotional roller-coaster and never broke its momentum, even when halfway through the season, the show reinvented itself. With episode 13, \"Phase One\" (which aired after the Super Bowl to the show's biggest audience), Syd's original nemesis (and employer) SD-6 changes forever, yet the kick-butt agent still finds herself going up against the malevolent leader Sloane (Ron Rifkin) and his ever-changing set of henchmen. Action fans got plenty of fighting, while romanticAliaswatchers swooned as Syd and the dashing Vaughn (Michael Vartan) finally consummated their unrequited love.The critically acclaimed show owed a debt toBuffy the Vampire Slayerfor its mix of action, romance, mystery, and moral quandaries, but in this seasonAliastruly came into its own--with a climax that came as a total shocker and prepped the show for an emotionally volatile third season. Guest stars included the phenomenal Amy Irving as Sloane's wife, Faye Dunaway as a nefarious bigwig, Christian Slater as a kidnapped scientist, and Ethan Hawke as a fellow CIA agent (or rather, two of them), but it was the dysfunctional nuclear family of Syd, Irina, and father Jack (Victor Garber) that gaveAliasits heart and its strength, whether the three perfectly cast actors (all Emmy nominated) were just bickering or undertaking deadly hand-to-hand combat.

{"description": "KISS bassist/chief provocateur/world-class swagmeister Gene Simmons once infamously claimed that his cartoon shock-rockers were more influential than Dylan, though the driving sentiment behind this double-disc DVD chronicle of the band's liaison with the Melbourne Symphony seems to paraphrase \"Love Minus Zero\": \"There's no success like excess / and excess is the best success of all.\" The history of the fusion of rock bands and orchestras is a long and notoriously spotted one, though matters of decorum have seldom concerned--or deterred--KISS. Disc 1 outlines the genesis of the project, with an earnest and typically irony-free Simmons meeting with perpetually bemused conductor David Campbell to discuss mutual musical quandaries, like synchronizing explosions and whether the orchestra can get their KISS makeup on with due haste. Rehearsal and preparation footage display an unusually affable orchestra and band, a mood that carries over into its pyrotechnic-punctuated greatest hits set with the band (Tommy Thayer ably filling the platforms of the departed Ace Frehley). It all works surprisingly well, if at some pitched, Vegas-showroom-in-hell level of bombast. It's a technically impressive show and package, if one that feels distinctly padded as a double-disc (the performance of the \"Symphony\"'s Act III is repeated on both discs). Less is more?

{"description": "The great PBS science seriesNovascores another hit withMars: Dead or Alive, capturing all the excitement surrounding the Mars rover landings of early 2004. Originally broadcast just as the first of the twin rovers (\"Spirit\" and \"Opportunity\") was experiencing temporary communication problems with Earth-bound mission controllers, this riveting hour-long episode chronicles the risky $820 million Mars Exploration Rover (MER) project from design to touchdown, dramatically illustrating (through the use of detailed simulations and sophisticated computer animation) the considerable chances of failure--a nail-biting gamble considering that fully two-thirds of all previous Mars missions never reached their destination. Through rigorous testing and initial failure of the MER parachute system to the celebrated transmission of pristine photos from the \"Spirit\" landing site, we see just how intensely complex and emotionally involving the missions are, especially for Cornell University astronomer and lead MER scientist Steve Squyres and his devoted team of colleagues at Pasadena's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Careers are on the line as technical problems accumulate, and one feels the same mixture of dread, anxiety, and elation that accompanied the historic return of Apollo 13. A bonus interview with Mars-mission pioneer Donna Shirley puts everything into resonant perspective, celebrating science and the MER missions as an essential human endeavor.As with allNovaprograms, the DVD includes a generous variety of study materials including an interview with Squyres, a detailed look at the anatomy of the Mars rovers, links to a companion website, and a \"math activity\" feature allowing viewers to understand the aerodynamic variables of parachute design. If you're among those who feel that NASA and MER tax dollars are wasted, this DVD will probably change your opinion.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0007GP79G", "B003QWVPGW", "B002TC6J1G", "B004QSQMG8", "B0000B1OFW", "B0037FFB9A", "B0031L5CSU", "B004ODLUF8", "B00080ETMM"], "bought_together": ["B0007GP79G"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004ZQJ5CO", "B001BEK8CY", "B000FIMG40", "B0031L5CSU"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 327128}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 11.11, "brand": "PBS", "asin": "B0000B1OFZ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41HH7FS2M4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "NOVA - Mars, Dead or Alive"}

{"description": "The complete first season of the much-maligned supernatural television seriesForever Knightmakes its DVD debut in a five-disc set that should satiate its devoted fans and intrigue first-time viewers with its well-blended mix of horror and crime detection.Forever Knightfirst aired in 1989 as a two-hour TV-movie titledNick Knight, starring Rick Springfield as a thirteen-century vampire who moonlighted as a police detective. Though the movie was not a hit for CBS, the network created a new two-part version of the pilot titledForever Knightfeaturing Welsh actor Geraint Wyn Davies as the undead sleuth. The series was launched in May of that year as part of a late-night syndicated package calledCrimetime After Primetime.The first season outlined the series' essential storyline: Knight wanted to atone for his bloody past and regain his humanity, but was challenged by master vampire Lucien LaCroix (Nigel Bennett). Knight's partner in crime-solving was the smarmy Det. Schanke (John Kapelos), and scientist Natalie Lambert (Catherine Disher) aided Knight in his desire to become human and struggled with her attraction to him (which would endanger her in episode 16, \"Only the Lonely\"). Knight's adventures yielded a small but loyal following over its three-season run, which was constantly threatened with cancellation; a letter-writing campaign saved the program after CBS axed it in '93, but failed two years later, when Knight's adventures came to a permanent end.Columbia-TriStar's DVD set compiles all 22 episodes of the first season (note: the series was presented in three different formats--a 40-minute version for American audiences, a 47-minute version for Canadian and Australian viewers, and a European version which contained nudity; the episodes compiled here are the Canadian versions save for the first episode, which has the American network running time). Hardcore fans may be disappointed by a lack of any extras aside from trailers for three vampire-themed Columbia features (includingTsui Hark's Vampire Hunters), but should be consoled by having the full debut season in one attractive package.--Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0006D3HE2", "B000H5TH16", "B004YPED14", "B00344EAG4", "B000CEV3MI", "B0000844IS", "B00LT1JHLW", "B002DLB1H0", "B002QU1Z1K", "B001UGJUSG", "B00E5G03J8", "B00170LCWC", "B008I34YOO", "B000QUEQ4U", "B00092A1J4", "B000001P1P", "B0007DA3V6", "B005SW2ROC", "B00020HCBI", "B0001BKBGQ", "B00KM5F31O", "B000EOTV98", "B0001ZX0GA", "B00BHLTIXQ", "B005GP7ELM", "B0037AGB9O", "B0010YVCAM", "B000W4KT9G", "B001PXYH9G", "B002FG9N50", "B0000CABIJ", "B001VG2ME4", "B000ATQYWY", "B00344EAFU", "B00062IYLE", "B0012IX35S", "B000JLTRHW", "B000SMNL92", "B00000J7W6", "B000WTZ6SK", "B004U7MQYC", "B00FUABG1C", "B002FLOTPO", "B00009MEJT", "B003IMERF6", "B001RHGRTS", "B00133QNSG", "B006LG74RE", "B00IWTVDUW", "B003XMKU0M", "B0011FLH00", "B00DPJEWD4", "B004R35DLW", "B00F1BFZXA", "B0010TDRP0", "B0009JE6FM", "B00006LPCK", "B00F3L8P26", "B00133QNS6", "B0085KGG96", "B0009A407A", "B003H9LIU2", "B000R7I48G", "B004EXWGHY", "B00GTZWZH6", "B0024FAR66", "B003BGZ61S", "B0002MHDW4", "B0081QF6Q8", "B000ATQYXI", "B003XMKU3Y", "B00CRX82LM", "B001AZIRZO", "B008H1Q61G", "B0030VANIU", "B00080ZG2E", "B009LDCXNY", "B00B04NIZO", "B000I0QLS2", "B0051GOB2G", "B003CNQPOW", "B00BI6SRKK", "B000FOPPBA", "B001DF681G", "B0006Z2KZ2", "B007AFC0W4", "B008I34Z34", "B00344EAKA", "B00BGI086Q", "B009T3AGK8", "B00BD6K54G", "B00022FWEU", "B000BCCAEQ", "B00GX7D5G0", "B000Z6GT4K", "B000PHX8RA", "B009LDD5XQ", "B000092T3Y", "B0017KP8Y0", "B002JVWR4U"], "bought_together": ["B0006D3HE2", "B000H5TH16"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004YPED14", "B00E5G03J8", "B00344EAG4", "B0006D3HE2"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 67880}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 12.5, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B0000C23T1", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41V1AKB6NRL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Forever Knight - The Trilogy, Part 1 (1992 - 1993)"}

{"description": "Based on the bestseller by John Grisham,Runaway Juryis a slick thriller that's exciting enough to overcome the gaps in its plot. The ultimate target has been changed: Grisham's legal assault on the tobacco industry was switched to the hot-button issue of gun control (no doubt to avoid comparison toThe Insider) in a riveting expos&#xE9; of jury-tampering. Gene Hackman plays the ultra-cynical, utterly unscrupulous pawn of the gun-makers, using an expert staff and advanced electronics to hand-pick a New Orleans jury that will return a favorable verdict; Dustin Hoffman (making his first screen appearance with real-life former roommate Hackman) defends the grieving widow of a gun-shooting victim with idealistic zeal, while maverick juror John Cusack and accomplice Rachel Weisz play both ends against the middle in a personal quest to hold gun-makers accountable. It's riveting stuff, even when it's obvious that Grisham and director Gary Fleder have glossed over any details that would unravel the plot's intricate design.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783226942", "B000P5FH3K", "B002NZK5R8", "B00AEFXYJA", "B002NZK5UU", "0767810872", "B002NZK5VO", "B0000694XY", "630542828X", "B00AEFXT1S", "B0006HBZBA", "B0045HCJ8K", "B0000C3I8M", "B004EPYZP8", "B0010YSD7W", "B00096S49Y", "B000063US3", "B000R4SMCW", "1558908382", "B001NY4WYC", "B003ASLJIQ", "6305428115", "B00005B6JZ", "B00005JL8F", "B00005UQ9T", "B00008EY9G", "B00008K77D", "0800141806", "B00005JPT0", "B00003CXFV", "B000P0I4O4", "B000CEV3M8", "B00441GYPG", "0790732149", "B000SFOW8I", "B000TJ6PBK", "0783240295", "B001I2EQUY", "B000055Y0Y", "B000NTMA0Q", "B002O3Z4ZW", "B002AT8KAG", "0790730979", "B00003CY5G", "B0038Z5T4Q", "B004SIP9RO", "B004YCKKFK", "B002AS464Q", "B00AMSM9DG", "0783226888", "B00AADAK5W", "B0031OCY2E", "B002DU39GW", "B00000K3TU", "B002LMV7R0", "B0013D8LBS", "B000GFLKF8", "B000CEXEWA", "B00008L3S6", "B00005ATZT", "B00AEBB9UK", "6304806434", "B002AT8K9W", "B00AEFXEGS", "B003ASLJQ8", "B0043X1FNQ", "B000BNX3B4", "B001CC7PLM", "B002QW7AMG", "B000JYW5BE", "B000Y11B8U", "B001HVZOB6", "B00BLN4UKQ", "B005NKIPUY", "B00015YVDG", "B00H91LWDC", "0792844874", "6305657947", "B003L20IG0", "0780618548", "B00DWZHTOU", "B003Q6D2B4", "B000ENC5YW", "B00GUO2SKA", "B0010YVCB6", "B00009WVSL", "B000G5SILC", "B000F8DV1M", "B00FQRZ6EM", "B000OYAT3U", "B00AEFXIIW", "B008JFURII", "B00005JNQA", "B002O3Z4XY", "B000059XTK", "B00005JN5E", "B001ECDVK4", "B000K7VHQ4", "B00000JGHL"], "bought_together": ["B000P5FH3K", "0783226942"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001I2EQUY", "B000P5FH3K", "B00AEFXYJA", "B002NZK5VO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 38867}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.67, "brand": "Twentieth Century Fox", "asin": "B00014NEZI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51X52Z0CBSL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Runaway Jury (Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "The slippery protagonist ofThe Talented Mr. Ripleyreturns in another deadly guise inRipley's Game, a well-appointed star vehicle. The star this time is John Malkovich, whose older Tom Ripley has settled into an Italian villa and a life of aesthetic contemplation (a little like Hannibal Lecter inHannibal). A former partner (Ray Winstone) drags an innocent frame-maker (Dougray Scott), dying of leukemia, into the role of unexpected hit man. Ripley, for his own enigmatic reasons, helps. Liliana Cavani, ofThe Night Porternotoriety, directed this handsome if nebulous film (which has no connection to theMatt Damon picture, other than a Patricia Highsmithsource novel). Malkovich exudes his usual oily disenchantment with the world; Lena Headey, like the location footage, is gorgeous.

The catch: In exchange for $1500 in car parts and Alvin's automotive expertise, Paris agrees to \"fake a front\" with him to convince the school that they're dating. The question is: can Alvin rein in his newfound ego before he loses his true friends, his chance for a scholarship and a shot at a real relationship with Paris?DVD Features:Additional ScenesAlternate endings:Paris takes center stage in a surprise alternate endingDocumentary:Marvelous making-of documentaryMusic Video:2 Music Videos: \"Shorty (Put it on the Floor)\" by platinum selling rap stars Busta Rhymes, Chingy, Fat Joe and film star Nick Cannon \"Luv Me Baby\" by Murphy LeeTheatrical Trailer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000FS9ULC", "B0001MMGC2", "B00005JPK8", "B000XSWVEC", "B0034G4P1C", "B000BTITFI", "B0002B14UW", "B00004Y2R1", "B0001CNRS4", "B00AMEZDJW", "B00003CY51", "B00BTYPWDQ", "6305505780", "0780627822", "B000HDZKLO", "B000093I8L", "B00E1HIXA2", "B000BVM1WI", "B00AEFYE08", "B00177YFYM", "B002CAWNEM", "B00005RIX5", "B000LRZHR8", "B00E1HIX66", "B0007N1A36", "B0000TWMTS", "B00005JLON", "6304821832", "B005LAIH86", "B00066FAQW", "B001DJLD12", "B00005LB86", "B002VWNICM", "B00000JGHV", "B000BITV9W", "B000069DOB", "B002CA68NO", "B002GSXKOM", "B000YAF4Q6", "B00DW5IL2E", "B00AEFXOKO", "B00AEFXY6I", "B000XT1P20", "B00007BK2S", "B00008977B", "B0041QSZS8", "0783240201", "B00005TNER", "B0006QAIG4", "B000TLOMPE", "0767821955", "B0009RCPUW", "630592273X", "1558908390", "B00006LPH6", "B0021L8V2A", "B0002J4YVK", "B00007ELEO", "B003UEYBPI", "B000FUTVLY", "B000035P5I", "B00BLN4V46", "B00006HAYO", "B00005JKWM", "B00000JGHO", "B002GSXKO2", "B000J3OTSM", "6305428409", "B000IFRT4W", "B002DOBGWM", "B004P7CMZ0", "B000065V3H", "B000JJSL1W", "B0000AGQ6T", "B00GOZ2LPM", "B000PE0GRI", "B000E5N68E", "B004WJT5E2", "B001CIOCOY", "B002FOFX9M", "B0009P42RS", "B001JV5AZE", "B002TZS5QU", "B00005U156", "B004SIP93S", "B001TUZGPO", "B00066FAVW", "B0068FYZES", "B002GHHK3U", "B005DEUEYA", "B004SIP9X8", "B000XT1P52", "B00006SFL7", "B00003CXKD", "B00AEFYQWO", "B000AM4P9K", "B000803BQC", "B00AEFYAC0", "B00066FAC6", "B00005JLG1"], "bought_together": ["B00004Y2R1"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00004Y2R1", "B00AMEZDJW", "B0002B14UW", "B000RETOHO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 164741}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.94, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B0001FR3HM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51YQEJ822HL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Love Don't Cost a Thing (Full Screen Edition)"}
{"description": "Tony Kushner's prize-winningplayAngels in Americabecame the  defining theatrical event of the 1990s, an astonishing mix of philosophy,  politics, and vibrant gay soap opera that summed up the Reagan era for an  entire generation of theater-goers. Post-9/11 would  seem to be too late for a film version--philosophy and politics don't  always age well--but this 2003 HBO adaptation, ably directed by Mike Nichols  (The Graduate), provides a time capsule of the '80s and reveals the  deep emotional subcurrents that will give the play lasting power.The story centers around Prior Walter  (Justin Kirk) and Louis Ironson (Ben Shenkman), a gay couple that falls  apart when Prior grows ill as a result of AIDS. But cancer is not the only  thing invading Prior's life: He begins to have religious visions of an  angel (Emma Thompson,Sense and Sensibility) announcing that he is  a prophet. Louis, who doesn't cope well with disease and suggestions of  mortality, leaves and starts a relationship with Joe Pitt (Patrick  Wilson), a closeted Mormon who works for Roy Cohn (Al Pacino,Dog Day  Afternoon)--the real-life right-wing lawyer, notorious for his  ruthless behind-the-scenes machinations. Add in Joe's depressed and  hallucinating wife Harper (Mary Louise Parker,Fried Green  Tomatoes), his determined but open-minded mother Hannah (Meryl Streep,Adaptation), a fierce drag queen/nurse named Belize (Jeffrey  Wright,Basquiat, reprising his celebrated performance from the  Broadway production), and you've still only begun to discover the wealth  of characters and storylines in Kushner's ambitious work.The  powerhouse cast (also featuring James Cromwell, Michael Gambon, and Simon  Callow) is uniformly superb. The script has its weaknesses--some of the  fantastic elements, including Prior's journey to Heaven towards the end,  fall flat--but even what doesn't work is bristling with ideas and a  ferocious desire to capture human existence in this time and place.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["1559362316", "B00005AQMJ", "B000067D0Y", "B00A92MGLA", "0800141806", "B00KMULA9I", "B000053VAW", "1559360739", "B003VZNAU8", "B004AR4W4O", "B0000560PU", "B00005B8U4", "B000BZISX0", "B00D2UMHIS", "B006QVRVW2", "B0001HAGRE", "B00GUO2SKA", "B00018D3YQ", "B00996RSYM", "B003IG06PM", "B001CQONPE", "1559360615", "B00AEFY8MM", "B00005AWR9", "B00005JO5L", "B00005MKKV", "B00EU8RB14", "B00005QW5X", "B0000AYJV8", "B0045HCJ94", "B0000TAZB0", "B00EJGMF22", "B00008UALE", "B0030BOCFU", "0802136923", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B008SAPCAM", "B0007ZEOPK", "B001QUF3SW", "B00I4CWIVU", "B005ETAMFK", "B000PAAK5U", "B00005JOFQ", "B00GHP8SH4", "B0009W5IMO", "B00114XLZA", "B00F98FOPE", "B001Y7CVXC", "B007C95S9K", "B00G7QPXUI", "B000A9QK5K", "B00AXGX4DQ", "B0045HCJ8U", "B006QVRVJK", "B00H7LJ2UO", "B002VECLVO", "B00127RAGC", "B00008R9KD", "B00G4Q3KOC", "B00005JKIS", "B00005JKJA", "B005S9EIGU", "B004SIP71M", "B000NIVJFY", "B002SSNFUO", "B000228EGS", "B00003L9CK", "B004SUDQ1S", "B007V4QKYI", "1559363606", "B004LB5FCW", "B00005N89S", "B009XJ5ED2", "B0083V2VYG", "B000UPMZ30", "0767821009", "B002IVDLH8", "B00005V5NU", "B00GUO3C3W", "B00C1LIZMQ", "B000GG4Y32", "B009D004TA", "0802122388", "B00007L4MV", "155936078X", "B000WDVNMO", "B000068MBW", "1559363959", "B00004TJH0", "0571169341", "B00000F3FS", "B00FGVS0DM", "B000H5V8H2", "B0006GVJEY", "B0001HAGRY", "B000065V3L", "B0042L0OG8", "B00HUTPKA4", "B000YHQNCI", "B0030BOCMS"], "bought_together": ["1559362316"], "buy_after_viewing": ["1559362316", "B00005AQMJ", "B00AQKU1QC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 23141}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 15.99, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B0001I2BUI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/512MTZBBPML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Angels in America"}
{"description": "For many fans, the Superman revisionist seriesSmallvilletruly hit its stride in its second season, when it shifted focus from traditional comic book conflicts to one of self-discovery for its hero, a teenage Clark Kent (Tom Welling).  Fans and first-timers can judge for themselves with this six-disc set, which compiles all 23 episodes and a decent selection of supplemental features. Whereas season 1 focused on Clark using his powers to combat a host of menaces &#xE0; la the WB's other big fantasy hit,Buffy the Vampire Slayer, season 2 delved into Clark's past and the extent of his super powers, most notably in the back-to-back \"Heat,\" in which he discovers his heat vision, and \"Red,\" in which red kryptonite in the high school class rings uncorks Clark's less-than-upstanding side. Other plot developments from the season that pull the series in interesting directions include the arrival of Dr. Helen Bryce (Emanuelle Vaugier), who becomes involved with Lex Luthor (Michael Rosenbaum), but the season's most significant moment comes during episode 17, \"Rosetta,\" in which Clark learns of his Kryptonian origins courtesy of a scientist, who, in an effective bit of casting, is played bySupermanfilm star Christopher Reeve.The complexity of the writing and issues dealt with in season 2 markedSmallvilleas a series with depth and drama worthy of its considerable fan following as well as a second boxed set; fittingly, the supplements in this set are more expansive than on the first one.  Producers Alfred Gough, Miles Millar, and Greg Beeman and cast members Welling, Rosenbaum, and Kristen Kreuk weigh in on commentary tracks for two episodes (\"Red\" and \"Rosetta\"), while a trio of short featurettes explore Christopher Reeves's appearance in \"Rosetta,\" the show's visual effects, and the amusing \"Wall of Weird\" web page maintained by Chloe (Allison Mack). The extras are rounded out by a handful of deleted scenes and a gag reel.--Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0002Y0QV2", "B00005JLKB", "B0009A5MUO", "B000G1R4SO", "B000N6SE4U", "B000X5SMXY", "B001FB4VZS", "B002JVWRDQ", "B003L77GG0", "B000R206FK", "B002JVWRE0", "B001FB4W02", "B0012U7IWU", "B003L77GGA", "B00G4SCKAK", "B00080ZG2O", "B00BBXSPES", "B000BT96EG", "B00BBXSPCK", "B00BGI086Q", "B004XWLN20", "B00DTRR43W", "B000EHSVLE", "B00ED2IBXE", "B000EHSVLY", "B000FP2OPY", "B000F8O2OM", "B00260HH30", "B00133QNRW", "B009LDCXNY", "B00JF5G8WU", "B000R7GKQE", "B001MVWRNE", "B00CN009Y2", "B000EU1Q2M", "1401241824", "B00DYEN6XC", "B004YM6JI2", "B0001CNRS4", "B000B8384G", "B000I0QLR8", "B004YM6JLO", "1401243096", "B006LG74Q0", "B002JVWRB8", "B001DJLD2G", "B000BT96FA", "B000EHSVKK", "B004YPED14", "B0000AKY3Q", "B000NOKFGW", "B0015RRNMA", "B002JVWRD6", "B0058YPGL6", "B002JVWRAO", "B00915G4IC", "B007MDB6Y2", "B0001EFTH4", "B000X5SPBI", "B00005Y71G", "B001EWDXT8", "B000EHSVL4", "B005SH63HO", "B000HT3P60", "B00F4FFO8E", "B004LROMWU", "B000I0QLS2", "B002JVWR4A", "B000CCBC9O", "B0018RKEQY", "B0018CWEYY", "1401246370", "B00280LZAE", "B00915G6SU", "B0002CX1M0", "B0012BS5XU", "B001FB4W0C", "B004HW7JNS", "B00IYRLUAU", "B0019LY5IM", "B0053O89IS", "B000IJ79UW", "B000RO6JYK", "B000SMNL92", "B00EIL7E9C", "B001FB4VXU", "B00E5I2MDQ", "B00IGVJGZK", "B00HQOFAKI", "B00AEBBA36", "B004FQX5B6", "B0052C5EI4", "B0000DIXDR", "B00GZ0ML4C", "B008JFUS0U", "B008X6N8KW", "B00DXLO0D6", "B00CL151G4", "B000EHSVG4", "B005IA9JQ8"], "bought_together": ["B0002Y0QV2", "B00005JLKB"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005JLKB", "B004XWLN20", "B0002Y0QV2", "B000N6SE4U"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 6376}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 23.99, "brand": "WEA", "asin": "B0001JXPPC", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51YFOkMz2tL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Smallville: Season 2"}

{"description": "Though season 9 may not be the best period in a long line of groundbreaking television, it is still worthy of theX-Filesname. Knowing this was the last season had many fans prematurely disgruntled, and the expectation for \"going out with a bang\" was extremely high. Lots of longtime issues came to a head (Scully's single motherhood, new X-files agents at the helm, Agent Skinner is now a believer, Mulder MIA, etc.), and many new issues and plots arose. Learning the facts of his son's death, Agent Doggett (Robert Patrick) seeks out the missing Agent Mulder (David Duchovny) to help him expose the corrupt Deputy Director Kersh (James Pickens Jr.). Knowing that her gifted son William is a target of a religious cult, Scully (Gillian Anderson) enlists the help of the Lone Gunmen for protection. The missing Mulder is finally located. Unfortunately, he is being held in custody by the military on murder charges, which leads to the grand finale: the trial, not for a man guilty of murder, but for a man guilty of seekingthe Truth.The naysayers have plenty of valid complaints (particularly about the \"Super Soldiers\" segue), and many hated that the Mulder/Scully pairing was gone, but there are a few aspects that are universally positive, and there aren't many complaints about their replacements, Agent Doggett and Agent Reyes (Annabeth Gish). In fact, many feel that the show could have easily continued if the show's writing had been better. The final episode was more or less a 90-minute recap of theX-Filesphenomenon. After \"The Truth\" ended, disappointed hardcore fans couldn't help but feel it was a set-up for an upcoming movie, but casual fans should find the episode very helpful in linking together the mythos that entranced and confused viewers for years. It may not be up to par with the first six seasons, but season 9 is still a lot better than most television shows.

{"description": "Starsky & Hutch: The Complete Second Seasonproves the 1970s ABC series, in its sophomore year, both codified its earliest strengths while continuing to evolve into a sharper, wittier, and often darker show. Contributing to those improvements were the stars themselves: David Soul (who plays maverick police detective, intellectual, and health nut Ken Hutchinson) and Paul Michael Glaser (as Hutch's more impulsive, junk-food-junkie partner Dave Starsky), each of whom directed exemplary episodes in season 2. Series creators also struck a more entertaining balance between the comic and dramatic possibilities inherent in Starsky and Hutch's bluntly honest, fraternal relationship. A number of stories placed the guys in intentionally funny undercover situations: as garish gamblers in the two-part opener \"The Las Vegas Strangler;\" entertainment directors (named Hack and Zack) on a luxury cruise ship in \"Murder at Sea;\" gigolo-like dance aficionados in the playfully-titled \"Tap Dancing Her Way Right Back into Your Hearts;\" and, most amusingly, stunt men in \"Murder on Stage 17.\"Those are all good shows, and the duo often bicker within them, to great comic effect, like an old married couple. (Soul and Glaser's commitment to their schtick as well as their more emotionally raw collaborations is truly admirable.) But it's the relentlessly tougher episodes that prove each character's mettle and demonstrates the depth of Starsky and Hutch's mutual trust. Among these is the powerful \"Gillian,\" in which Starsky discovers Hutch's classy new girlfriend is a prostitute and breaks the news to his shattered friend. Somewhat lighter but just as revealing is \"Little Girl Lost,\" starring a young Kristy McNichol as an orphaned street urchin whom Hutch, lately in a misanthropic, anti-Christmas mood, takes into his home. Glaser's directorial debut, the harrowing \"Bloodbath,\" gives Soul a lot of room for an intensely physical and psychological performance as Hutch scurries to find his kidnapped partner. Soul returns the favor with \"Survival,\" in which Starsky desperately seeks his missing pal, trapped and slowly dying beneath a car wreck. All in all, a very good season, with (of course) Antonio Fargas still sharp as sidekick Huggy Bear.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000HEVZ7Q", "B0007A0F4Y", "B00018D3RI", "B00006J6XH", "B00008YLVB", "B00HZMZ286", "B00024JC4E", "B0001BS3IE", "B000FDFSH2", "B000LXGXY8", "B00AA8Q0JM", "B000BF0C8E", "B008OR5X6M", "B000N2HD6O", "B0077T5SOA", "B00008WJEZ", "B005EVY8NA", "B0049PBOFC", "B000UZ4NKI", "B000BGR1B4", "B000PMGS5E", "B000CELOV8", "B003W5C0TY", "B004M9ZI0C", "B0063FGG9U", "B000XJD3K2", "B001JFKWE4", "B000BKVKSA", "B000LC4C60", "B000LV6VZQ", "B00006J6XI", "B0009UC80G", "B000XJD3JS", "B0034BAKL6", "B0014FAIXE", "B00GX7D5JW", "B000WQWPSM", "B0030VANIU", "B003QS0E54", "B00DYQ1GBE", "1608322327", "B007KW5M6I", "B000GW8U9U", "B002WQ79A4", "B0011NVCA2", "B001J2XROY", "B008R4LO6A", "B0055CP9P4", "B00803LRK6", "B0014FAIVG", "B008H6GHII", "B005LFQRTC", "B001JAHQ0M", "B00HW3L9MG", "B0007LXP7W", "B001675ZJM", "B00HQLZCIQ", "B00JEZWRE4", "B000ATQYWY", "B000MLWQ6S", "B0007XG26G", "B0014VPFKY", "B0062VL4YW", "B001ACFQNS", "B000E5KQM8", "B000MLWQ6I", "B00005JNHU", "B001TWT0AO", "B001CQONOA", "B00005JO3P", "B0006BAWR4", "B000EMG90O", "B00IXPWGIS", "B000JLTE4S", "B000E5KQLY", "B00E96AYYS", "B00005JLEY", "B000VS6R30", "B0009UC80Q", "B000RZIGSQ", "B001DHXT7U", "B002XKKX8E", "B00EJSMOVW", "B003IRUFB6", "B00C7A8WNS", "B000BUE5CI", "B000AQ68SW", "B000Z6GT1I", "B000PGTPC8", "B0030Y12BO", "B001FT4PEW", "B00EJSMOPS", "B00EJRTYNO", "B0009S4IM4", "B00ESLAIYK", "B00AJXO48W", "B00ESL6GMI", "B00E96AWY0", "B001S86IYK", "B005SQRYS2"], "bought_together": ["B000HEVZ7Q", "B00018D3RI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00018D3RI", "B0007A0F4Y", "B000HEVZ7Q", "B00006J6XH"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 19273}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 10.6, "brand": "Columbia Tri Star", "asin": "B00023GGAI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51H355E8PJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Starsky &amp; Hutch - The Complete Second Season"}

{"description": "TV detective fans rejoice: Peter Falk's rumpled and infallible Lt. Columbo joins the DVD precinct with a five-disc set that features the detective's first nine appearances for NBC. Though Falk as Columbo (no first name) made his TV debut in 1967, the detective had actually first appeared on an episode of the 1960-61Chevy Mystery Show(Bert Freed played the role) written by veteran TV scribes Richard Levinson and William Link (The Fugitive,Alfred Hitchcock Presents). The pair turned the episode into a stage play titledPrescription: Murder, which was adapted into a TV movie in 1967 with Falk in the lead. NBC greenlit a two-hour Columbo pilot (Ransom for a Dead Man) in 1971, and the series was launched that fall as part of theNBC Sunday Mystery Movie, a rotating 90-minute program that alternatedColumbowith episodes ofMacMillan and WifeandMcCloud(another Levinson/Link creation). Viewers were quickly won over by Falk's shrewd performance as he matched wits with a host of exceptional guest stars (including Gene Barry, Patrick McGoohan, and others), all of whom assumed that the disheveled detective would never figure out their \"perfect crimes\"; the popularity and quality of the original series allows Falk to continue to don the trenchcoat some 30 years later for occasionalColumboTV movies.All seven 90-minute episodes of the 1971-72 debut season are included here, along withPrescription: MurderandRansom for a Dead Man; unfortunately, as the lieutenant himself would say, \"Oh, just one more thing\"--no extras are included in the set, but having these fine TV mysteries in one set should be reward enough for armchair sleuths.--Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0007CNY4K", "B0009NZ36O", "B000BF0C7A", "B00DZP1C18", "B000HT3Q1Y", "B00DZP1C0O", "B000MV9OMM", "B005TFVM0I", "B001JNNDRY", "B0049GYXBS", "B00005JO3P", "B000BGR1B4", "B000LE16VC", "B00005JN8S", "B0012EM5EW", "B000BF0C8E", "B000LXGXY8", "B001675ZJM", "B001GMH8WO", "B00005JNHT", "B000F48D0U", "B00005JNHS", "B000XJD3K2", "B000N2HD6O", "B00005JNHU", "0786719397", "B001FT4PEW", "B000B5XSVM", "B0025X4PAQ", "B000NOIX66", "B001JFKWE4", "B000HWZ4HU", "B002XKKX8E", "B002ZTLVXY", "B00006J6XH", "B00E8AVN9A", "B0012Z36FI", "B000LV6VZQ", "B003QTDH8E", "B006CR2OWM", "B000ASDFIG", "B0014FAIVG", "B00005JMHI", "B00H4ZEJCO", "B003YLM78U", "B008RJ6TTC", "B0013PVGGI", "B000OHZKZ4", "B003IB0FTE", "B000UX6TJI", "B000YKYT1M", "B000PGTPC8", "B000MGBSH6", "B000KGH00C", "B00008WJEZ", "B003YLM79E", "0786717955", "B001E6HUW0", "B005UL4NF2", "B003YLM794", "B000IHYXJO", "B008K1PWMW", "B002OID512", "B000MQCUJ6", "B002UOMGX8", "B000LPS2VS", "B000MQ4WNS", "B000AL733G", "B004Z74X0M", "B001UDPA9C", "B0081QF6LS", "B0014FAIXE", "B002JIOOAS", "B002JIOOD0", "B003RHZ6CK", "B001E6HUWK", "B000TXPXD2", "B00H3L86F0", "B004916TRE", "B00H4ZEJ6K", "B0081QF6QS", "B001675ZJW", "B000ERVJKO", "B00005JLIC", "B00HV0TJM2", "B003BGZ61I", "B0019F030M", "B000BUE5DC", "B000NDEXO8", "B005LFQRTC", "B0001JXQ2Y", "B000O59A52", "B000RZIGTA", "B0021FP3PO", "B000A9QKSM", "B0081QF6WW", "B000Z6GT18", "B0009UC80G", "B001DHXT7U", "B0007Y08SS"], "bought_together": ["B0007CNY4K", "B0009NZ36O"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B008RJ6TTC", "B0009NZ36O", "B000BF0C7A", "B000HT3Q1Y"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 25375}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 18.49, "brand": "FALK,PETER", "asin": "B0002COTDA", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5118JTJM8DL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Columbo - The Complete First Season"}

It follows the aging yoga guru Sri K. Pattabhi Jois as he gives his final North American workshop in New York City in September 2001. Devotees were arriving from all over the world to partake in a rare opportunity to practice with the 86 year-old Jois.  The 9/11 terrorist attacks took place in the midst of this celebration, and dramatically changed the meaning and purpose of this yoga gathering.

Maria is a Colombian teenager who, for a large paycheck, agrees to be a mule for drug-runners:  she has to swallow dozens of thumb-sized capsules of heroin and smuggle them into New York. This debilitating process is painstakingly described, and of course not everything goes as planned when Maria and her fellow mules land in America. Director Joshua Marston is working on a low budget, which explains the film's narrow, single-minded focus--but this may be a strength, not a weakness. The trump card is the lead performance of Catalina Sandrino Moreno, who won awards at the Seattle and Newport Film Festivals. Her empathetic face carries us along on Maria's journey, and humanizes a problem that is too easily relegated to a headline.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002FHGESI", "B00005JNCZ", "B0041KKYF6", "B000N3T0DW", "B00080Z53O", "B000O76ZQC", "B00005N8A9", "B00180IPM6", "B00008AOX5", "B0036TGSJE", "B008S2NABI", "B000YIGNCC", "B0007NBJHI", "B0042EJDGM", "B000RHRGSK", "B00AZMFKXK", "B005HFI7IU", "B000LV6OC6", "B00005JL57", "B0015ET3YO", "B003A0T8BO", "B004XVMCMG", "B000WC38IC", "B002M2T1VI", "B000N3SU6K", "B001ILTUKQ", "B0052LE7C4", "B005FIXA6S", "B002E01LOI", "B00GJNQ3S0", "B0047685T6", "B00075VX2C", "B00005JLQW", "B000AM4P90", "B001UV4XC4", "B004SIP7S0", "B00006G8G3", "B004SIP6GI", "B00005LZOD", "B0011FLH14", "B004MNM1FI", "B002M2T1V8", "B0086900LG", "B002BWP3UC", "B00E5G03KM", "B000AYEIDQ", "B00134PSV8", "B001FOPOD8", "B0000AMU29", "B00003CXRG", "B0014BQR6U", "B000274TLW", "B000LXHFMW", "B0000C9JFO", "B0001CNQX0", "B00004U1FA", "B00E1S1MMM", "B007961SAE", "B000GETTJI", "B004IF4EVY", "B00F6Y3E26", "B0032AJVE6", "B003O3EKRO", "B003X3BYJM", "B0009HLC9W", "B0000714BS", "B00000F5KH", "B002VECLXC", "B0000714BQ", "B0009S4IGK", "B002FUI4CE", "B00006BS7S", "B00APUAKYG", "B000K2V7F0", "B000SLYE6M", "0764146076", "B0000A2ZTY", "B0002VEZ3U", "1444137697", "B001M5BF7Y", "B000KJU15U", "B001Q56XOA", "B001QX014A", "0070020698", "B001S400C0", "B000VXUW0E", "B00H1RMPH6", "B000QYKDFC", "B000067IZ3", "B000JBXH78", "B00IQIAL8Y", "B007L6VPXC", "B0051T46YG", "B0002DRDIW", "B002EZLPOO", "B000N3T0DM", "B0002RQ316", "B0000U0X20", "B0013HL6ES"], "bought_together": ["B000O76ZQC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00180IPM6", "B0036TGSJE", "B005HFI7IU", "B000O76ZQC"]}, "price": 4.09, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 3577}, "asin": "B0002TT0MI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51o4PdGtr3L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Maria Full of Grace"}

{"description": "The bonus material is comprised of nine 4-6 minutes featurettes on various aspects of the production, giving insight on how the selection of director Paul Greengrass--with his documentary, impromptu methods--led to the film's much-talked-about style. The most interesting are about how they blow up things (without a computer) and a look at the Go Mobile, a new rig to capture a car chase on film. Even though it's not listed on the packaging, there is a commentary track with the director (uninteresting as it is). Something that is listed on the package, \"Explosive Deleted Scenes,\" is really about 7 minutes of ho-hum expository scenes.

{"description": "Forty years after the Cylon Wars, humanity's deadliest enemies have reemerged with a vengeance. In a sudden, devastating nuclear attack, the Cylon robots - who have now taken human form - wipe out billions of people. Only a handful of Colonial forces are left to shepherd the few survivors to safety. Commander William Adama (Edward James Olmos), the highest-ranking military officer left alive, reactivates the Battlestar Galactica to once again face humanity's greatest nemeses. Outnumbered and outarmed, Adama reluctantly concedes that the newly sworn-in President Laura Roslin (Mary McDonnell) is correct - this battle was lost before it had begun. With no choice but to flee, the ragtag fleet of survivors and humanity's only hope set out in search of the mythic 13th Colony of Kobol&#x2026; a legendary planet known as Earth.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000V5IP6K", "B002HRF68A", "B000BNI90Y", "B00129W6LE", "B001HUWQEA", "B002ZCY872", "B00A3717C0", "B001RTCP1U", "B0000AFX64", "B00466H3A4", "B0036EH3UC", "B00C7MW5SE", "B0026RHR6U", "B000W4KT9G", "B002HRF7AW", "B001993Y2M", "B002PXJRR2", "B0036EH3U2", "B003RR991Y", "B00A3718IS", "B002JE43O4", "B00344EAFK", "B0051GOB2G", "B000PHX8RA", "B002BAW6FE", "B0000UJL96", "B00402FGE4", "B002BAW6GI", "B0006FO9B0", "B004TJ1H3C", "B00CWX1HPA", "B004EXWGHY", "B00061QJSK", "B0012IXBNC", "B003PGNBO8", "B002BAW6FY", "B0012IX35S", "B00K8HALVI", "B00005B8UD", "B000067FP2", "B00HUPC5X8", "B000CEXFYW", "B0000AQS0F", "B00K8HAKSW", "B00AZMFJYA", "B000E5N6B6", "B0009Q0F5U", "B000FJH5M2", "B003H9LIRK", "B000EOTV98", "B002I9Z8AS", "B00J49R0ZQ", "B000FOPPBA", "B00005JKHP", "B000BOH8Y6", "B000UZ4C4A", "B000JLTRHW", "B00IWTVDUW", "B00F4FFO8E", "B002BAW6GS", "B00023BKMC", "B003H9LIYS", "B00BHLTIXQ", "B000N3T0EG", "B000BCCAEQ", "B002GP7ZV4", "B000YGHC0G", "B000ELL1QC", "B0013GS3WW", "B0002MHDW4", "B000WLU5ZM", "B000HEWEJ4", "B002BAW6H2", "B000QUEQ4U", "B002BVYBJW", "B003W5C0TY", "B001B7CNZ6", "B002U0KHME", "B004HYW84G", "B000E991A2", "B001MT7ZIS", "B00BUWD7WA", "B00B04NIZO", "B0028ERCMU", "B002OKK2AW", "B00003CXZ1", "B00GTZWZH6", "B00DB97LRC", "B0024FAD9C", "B007AFS118", "B000BW7QWW", "B00F3L8P26", "B00AEFYGBA", "B00BGI086Q", "B002U0KHNS", "B00022FWEU", "B007AFC0W4", "B006MFQ4OS"], "bought_together": ["B000V5IP6K", "B002HRF68A"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00A3717C0", "B0036EH3UC", "B002HRF68A", "B000BNI90Y"]}, "price": 10.17, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 58080}, "asin": "B00064AFBE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51PE4TY9CXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Battlestar Galactica (2003 Miniseries)"}

{"description": "Season 4: Feel free to insert your own \"four-play\" joke, or for that matter, your own \"insert\" joke. Sex is still topic 1 for the intertwined group of \"exes and best friends,\" but in this pivotal season there are momentous \"relationship issues\" that will upend all their lives (insert your own \"upend\" joke while you're at it). Susan is pregnant, inspiring in Steve nightmares about his own execution and unflattering comparisons of the birth process to John Hurt's iconic gut-busting scene inAlien. Missing in action is the Kramer-esque Jeff (although he makes something of a return in the season finale). Joining the ensemble is Oliver, who is more in the Chandler mode as a lovable loser with the ladies. These inevitable comparisons to \"Sein-Friends\" are no doubt heresy toCoupling's most devoted viewers. Indeed, this series does benefit from creator and sole writer Steven Moffat's comic voice and vision. He provides his ever-game cast some witty, funny-'cause-it's-true dialogue, as in Oliver's observation that \"Tea isn't compatible with porn.\" This Britcom is also less inhibited in language and sexual situations than its American counterparts. In the cleverly-constructed opening episode, in which the same \"9-1/2 Minutes\" are witnessed from three different perspectives, Sally and Jane can do what was left to the imagination when Monica and Rachel offered to make out in front of Joey and Chandler. The birth of Susan and Steven's baby ends the six-episode season on a satisfying and surprisingly moving grace note. A bonus disc takes viewers behind the scenes with segments devoted to bloopers and interviews with cast and crew.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0001JXP7K", "B0000AQS8B", "B0000797E5", "B001PMRBMC", "B002AL2TPQ", "B00K2CHWYI", "B000FJGWC6", "B002C3GTLC", "B00006G9X4", "B002EOVX9W", "B00443FN1A", "B00HUCF7WW", "B001YYQA0K", "B0009WFFBS", "B001NOMOS8", "B002945DX4", "B003TY2STU", "B000F7CMSG", "B000SINSVC", "B001PWY4U4", "B002LFPAUC", "B000HLDFAE", "B003L77GTC", "B000TLTCPO", "B00E688720", "B0056GLNQI", "B000FFJYE8", "B004VPUR44", "B00GOC74QG", "B002LFPAUM", "B001AQBGM4", "B00361XWF0", "B00005U2KS", "B004EXWGHY", "B002AMVED8", "B002HWRZTI", "B001EHF3RS", "B0009NSCTY", "B001QE99BA", "B00361XWEQ", "B00BVMXBDO", "B00361XWFA", "B000PHX8RA", "B000QXDEH2", "B0009WFFB8", "B000GI3RZ6", "B00EJSMP20", "B002DQSKME", "B0000AUHQE", "B001ASIHZG", "B0009WFFD6", "B00363WGB4", "B000PC6YQC", "B00BUWD7Y8", "B000784WKO", "B0009FVS8Y", "B007K7IBTI", "B002OOWLEI", "B007AFC0W4", "B00662CH02", "B00GZP0MI4", "B005G172Q8", "B001OQCVCE", "B0000ALPJL", "B0009S2SQ2", "B000MGBLFK", "0765319616", "B009LDD1X0", "B0019MFY3Q", "B00FPPQYXM", "B004XM38CS", "B002AK9UPO", "B002HRF68A", "B009DS7CGU", "B001NXDIMK", "B000EWBNM8", "B00FFEM0W2", "B008KHIKWK", "B004MWLXTY", "B007AFS118", "B008B4LRMC", "B00AHQQHFE", "B0006N2EZK", "B00FEVZ960", "B00CYQXHLC", "B000ABKHZC", "B0000AQS0F", "B00BHLTIXQ", "B0089AD8IO", "B000KGGIRI", "B003EYVXXW", "B002ZCY80O"], "bought_together": ["B0001JXP7K", "B0000AQS8B"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0001JXP7K", "B0000797E5", "B0000AQS8B", "B0006HBLU0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 55977}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 18.1, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00065GX8C", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515BBZDNZ1L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Coupling - The Complete Fourth Season"}

Both tracks are thoughtful and filled with details about Cole Porter's life, how the pop singers joined the film, and how their numbers were conceived. As might be expected, a lot of stories are repeated, but they're good stories, such as how \"Be a Clown\" was ripped off forSingin' in the Rain's \"Make 'Em Laugh.\" There's a very good 25-minute making-of featurette, plus a 15-minute music featurette that mixes clips and performances from the film with brief comments by the pop artists performing them (the Broadway re-creations are only mentioned in passing).  Two other featurettes go behind the scenes of two numbers, and the eight deleted scenes include Kevin Kline's short performance of \"You Do Something to Me.\"  Because the musical numbers have the most replay value, it's convenient that they're listed on the scene-selection menu.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000294SIE", "B00023GGHQ", "B0001WTWXS", "B000294QX6", "B0012GMVH6", "B00094ARN2", "0679727922", "B0000047BH", "B006AC9H92", "6305127670", "B004H0M2X2", "B00005B15A", "B00005IA7Y", "B001DE29SS", "B005MYEQ4U", "B000EBD9SA", "B00GPWEPZ8", "6305161879", "B00008G7UF", "B00000DRCN", "B0000ARD7O", "B00003CX8N", "B000PAAK5A", "B008FYZHZ6", "B0088X7Z6S", "0394582357", "B00008NFR4", "B00005YUPC", "B00FZRP8FU", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B000EWBKMG", "B000F7CEC0", "B0007939MK", "B0000C23T2", "B000056HEA", "0739069640", "B00083FZFE", "B00DL48BM6", "B00AMSQBSU", "B0012OX7DA", "B0059XTUB8", "B003UESJH4", "B004YCKJNI", "B004SEUJBE", "B00005NGAE", "B0008ENIKM", "B001KZOVJK", "B000KWZ7JC", "B003GOP0D4", "B001ECDVJU", "B007XTDWKQ", "B00031TXC2", "B00GSBMNOQ", "B00BTYSIV4", "B00D2CYU2W", "0783240171", "B000HT3PGU", "B00G7QPXUI", "B00008L3U6", "B000RPCK2E", "B00E849QSG", "B000055WFW", "B00441GYV0", "B00E1HIWXU", "B00GUO2SKA", "B005S9EJ14", "B00508W3FW", "B00CFHEF48", "B0045HCJ80", "B0017I79BW", "B001DJ7PR8", "B004ZJHSAM", "B0006SGYM4", "B0007QJ1ZW", "B000ND91YU", "B004SIP9VA", "B007P7UF0G", "B005VH4HCE", "B00000G3I2", "B001D8W7EU", "B003WKQ46E", "B0000CE684", "B0036TGT8Y", "B00005JKNF", "B0001FR54I", "B0090XLDKY", "B00HHYF5EI", "B000FC2FX8", "B003O2H7MA", "B0007ZEOPK", "B00GWWV1XU", "B00H83EUQW", "B004G7XCRQ", "B00003CXC9", "B00GHP8SH4", "B00008DDRU", "B000KNFP6G", "6305803765", "B0001CNRBG"], "bought_together": ["B000294SIE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0001WTWXS", "B00023GGHQ", "B000294SIE", "B00094ARN2"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 10160}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.48, "brand": "Generic", "asin": "B00067BBLY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51E8VXPWJML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "De-Lovely: The Cole Porter Story (Special Edition)"}

{"description": "Signaling the arrival of a gifted young filmmaker,La commare secca(orThe Grim Reaper) marked the promising debut of Bernardo Bertolucci, who would attain world-class prominence in less than a decade. Having served as director's assistant on his friend Pier Paolo Pasolini's successful debutAccattonethe previous year, Bertolucci was only 21 when he co-wrote and directed this impressively structured drama (based on a story by Pasolini) about a murdered prostitute and the police interrogation of several potential suspects. Bertolucci has denied the influence of Kurosawa'sRashomon(which he hadn't yet seen), but that film's prismatic structure is echoed here in the chapter-like retelling of circumstances surrounding the murder, as described through the suspects' unclear memories, conflicting testimonies and subtly hidden agendas. Punctuating the mystery with scenes of the prostitute's final hours, Bertolucci defies his directorial assignment (Pasolini had declined the job, and Bertolucci was hired to approximate Pasolini's visual style) with an ever-moving camera that tracks each suspect through a variety of ominous Roman locations. As he explains in an exclusive interview on this Criterion DVD, Bertolucci was the youngest person on the set, and extremely anxious as a first-time director, but his talent speaks for itself.La commare seccawas not a hit with critics, but it's a remarkable debut by any standard, fully vindicated by Bertolucci's subsequent greatness.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0007M222A", "B00152VXU8", "B0006HC0FU", "B000K0YLX2", "B00HE010QM", "B00K6D1R0I", "B004M66YUS", "B0002DB4YQ", "B00007CVS3", "B00005UQ7Q", "B000XPSC0W", "B0035ECI12", "B00GBT62PQ", "B00004XQN5", "B000PKG6OY", "B00005NFZD", "B008Y5OXB0", "B00005BCJZ", "B000E1YW9A", "B0001ZIVAA", "B0000560QE", "B000BR6QCS", "B000FUF7D0", "B00005JKFX", "B00GPPXNLC", "B0006HC0F0", "B004ALIG1U", "B000BC8SWE", "B000QXDFR6", "B001D8W7F4", "B001PYD0L6", "B000093NR1", "B00008RH13", "B001LMU19G", "B00005BCK0", "0780023099", "B00005UQ7R", "B00HE011DE", "B000067IY4", "B00HVOFP6W", "B00B2BYXSQ", "0780021320", "B0009WIE2K", "B000HT3QBE", "6305081034", "B00152VXUI", "B0026VBOJW", "B00014K5ZU", "B000H5U5KS", "B00009MEA3", "B009VO9XSG", "B0019X400I", "B0002JP2OS", "B000E1YVZ0", "B00B2BYY1M", "B001D8W7EK", "B0019X4008", "0780023277", "B0000CDUT5", "B000NOK0GW", "B00005JLV7", "B001BSBBDK", "B001CW7ZSU", "B00000IOKV", "B000093NR0", "B004ALIG4M", "B0000A02TW", "B006X96PE2", "B000BR6QCI", "B000VARC3C", "B0011U3OA6", "B000CBG5PG", "B00014K5YG", "B00049QJ9I", "B000087EY6", "B000E1OI80", "B00B2BYXWM", "B000093NR2", "B003N2CVRC", "B00HE010LC", "B00B08YRB4", "B001NH4CIA", "B000A88EV4", "B00008RH14", "B00H9HZGQ0", "B00005JH9B", "B000E5LEVA", "B003N2CVQI", "B000JYW5AU", "B0006HC0I2", "078002205X", "B00F98FOFY", "B00AQ6J64O", "B00004W3HG", "B009RWRIP2", "B00005A8TV", "B000KRNGNQ", "B001CW7ZSA", "6305257450", "B000KRNGNG"], "bought_together": ["B0007M222A", "B00005BCJZ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B007L6VR12", "B008Y5OXB0", "B005BZLBO8", "B003U4H0CE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 83082}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 26.18, "brand": "CICCORA,VINCENZO", "asin": "B0006Z2NB8", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51JWGJ9BY0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "La Commare Secca (The Criterion Collection)"}
{"description": "Because ofGilligan's IslandandThe Brady Bunch, writer-producer Sherwood Schwartz will forever be a TV hall-of-famer. They were his only real hits, but they were both grand slams in their prime times and have remained syndicated favorites ever since. Following closely on theGilligan's Islandseason 2release,The Brady Bunchis ready for home theaters with a nicely designed, 4-disc set of 25 first-season episodes. The pilot episode, \"The Honeymoon\" sets up the story we all know from the theme song (lyrics by Schwartz) by giving us the marriage of Mike and Carol and the coming together of the six kids. Schwartz provides commentary for just this first show, but he fondly recalls his intention of sweet, subdued, and often corny gags the pre-fab family encountered as a precise format each week. Two other episodes include commentary by Barry Williams (Greg), Christopher Knight (Peter), and Susan Olson (Cindy), and their reminiscences are equally affectionate about time on the show and everyone's surprise at its enormous success. EveryBradyepisode is a classic in some sense, and this first of five seasons (those kids did grow up fast) includes some real charmers when the six Brady kids still seemed impossibly young. It's hard to say the show was ever hip, even though it became slightly more attuned to a pop sensibility as the Bradys moved into the '70s. But man, is this 1969 everyfamily ever square. Even so, it's hard to resist the way each one gets their own screen time with shows devoted to simple childhood joys and traumas--Jan's missing locket, Cindy's missing baby doll, Greg's crush on his math teacher, Peter's swelled head when he gets his picture in the paper, etc.In a brief bonus featurette we get more innocuously entertaining interview comments from Schwartz, Williams, Olson, Knight, and Mike Lookinland (Bobby). It's interesting that all the subjects make note of how seriously the classically trained (now-deceased) Robert Reed took his role as patriarch, Mike Brady. His reputation as being \"difficult\" followed the long run of the show, but if Schwartz's first choice had gotten the role it could have been a lot worse. (Schwartz is delighted to reveal the famous name and career path that followed, so the mystery shouldn't be spoiled here.) As it was during its TV run,The Brady Bunchon DVD is clearly meant for a specific generation--yours.--Ted Fry", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0009I7NH6", "B000A0GORS", "B000B5XOUM", "B000CCBCHQ", "B0007V6IWQ", "B000291Q3Y", "B00GOC75YW", "B00HVFA36I", "B0009B16TO", "B0006BAWSI", "B005SQRYOG", "B0050MB5AC", "B00AEFXKIK", "B0006N2F0E", "B0072BNJ0I", "B00B1LQB2S", "B0002NY8PI", "B00FWMVVF4", "B000MGBSEY", "B000291Q3O", "B00GOC74RU", "B00I099K4U", "B000OVLBH6", "B00020X83Y", "B00DXLO086", "B0000C2IVT", "B000EQ45BU", "B000B7HZUK", "B0001CNQUS", "B0002JZT5U", "B00A2L1CKO", "B005M2A4CA", "B000HEZEYG", "B00008WJEZ", "B000B8I9ZY", "B000IJ79VG", "B0000DFZ5O", "B00009QG5P", "B0000AKY3Q", "B006OKOWBI", "B000E1MXVO", "B000002OND", "B000BB1MIW", "B000CELOVI", "B000E3L7FK", "B004IK30RI", "B000EXZFS0", "B00GOC75FQ", "B000C6NPHC", "B0014FAIYS", "B000ASDFIQ", "B0000V4906", "B0002DB5N6", "B000M343AS", "B000FQIRWC", "B00DXLO0BI", "B0007Y08P6", "B000M343AI", "B0002I837M", "B00HVFA39A", "B000HIVIOM", "B001992NXI", "B00DXLO0D6", "B000PY52CW", "B000AC7PF6", "B00KAVPEZA", "B000Z6GT18", "B000U1ZV4E", "B00AEBB98W", "B0001Z3I1C", "B0009OUBPQ", "B000LV6O12", "B00005JLIC", "B0077PBPZU", "B00GOC74Z2", "B000EGDANO", "B0001DMXEC", "B000FKP3XY", "B00008J2EB", "B00008NV4G", "B000BYRCF6", "B001LM64VK", "B0006IUDXA", "B0009UC80Q", "B000B8IA3U", "B000H1RFXM", "B00650RX90", "B0072BNKHA", "B0081VI0Z2", "B000FA57U8", "B008L36520", "B0007KIFK0", "B00IODHZ08", "B00016JE5U", "B00005JLIB", "B0001EFV9K", "B0009UC7MK", "B0007WQHFS", "B00A4Y62JU", "B002E58FT2"], "bought_together": ["B0009I7NH6", "B000A0GORS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000MGBSEY", "B0009I7NH6", "B000A0GORS", "B000CCBCHQ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 10514}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 12.99, "brand": "Paramount", "asin": "B0006Z2L4W", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51CGRZE2BTL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Brady Bunch - The Complete First Season"}

{"description": "A vintage Stephen King concept unfolds inRiding the Bullet:  a college kid, circa 1970, must hitchhike a very long (and very dark) hundred miles to visit his hospitalized mother. The ghosts waiting for him along the way are either real or of his own mind (which seems to be a dark place itself). As a King short story, this might have been a usefully frightening premise, but it's almost entirely literary; on screen, it boils down to a guy walking down a road at night. Jonathan Jackson is suitably tortured in the lead role (or roles--he frequently appears double on screen, arguing with himself), but the movie is stolen by David Arquette, rocking it up as a '50s greaser who died in a car crash years earlier. Barbara Hershey and Erika Christensen are wasted in support. There's a strain to make the Woodstock-era setting relevant, but this doesn't seem to have a great deal to do with the private demons of the protagonist. (And if you're going to set it in 1970, how hard is it to catch dialogue anachronisms?) Director Mick Garris is a longtime King conduit (The Stand), but this one is misconceived from the start.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000G1R39E", "B00005UQ9V", "B000053UIF", "B006J8NPAE", "B00000F3SB", "B0000C2IQQ", "B000GYI340", "B00AEBB91O", "B0007WFXNA", "0767821599", "B0002A2VK0", "B00AEBB91E", "6305645574", "0792841328", "B000U1ZV6W", "B00005O439", "1573625779", "B0002OXVG4", "6305120021", "B0033HKCV4", "B00AEFYV9W", "B0001FVDQ4", "B0002O7XW2", "B0002234LS", "B00AEFXR8I", "B0010X73ZG", "B000TJ6PBK", "B00BW4S87U", "B000063US5", "B00009OWI3", "B00BTYPW7C", "B0053TWVDC", "B000068IES", "630523650X", "B0053TWV46", "B00005LQ0Q", "6304936397", "B000GBEWRU", "B00030AZCK", "B002NZK5SM", "B00006FDCD", "B00A1AU72A", "1573626910", "B000077VRT", "B00BW4S89S", "B00AKGG828", "0790742829", "B00APQLJTA", "6304604572", "B000069I05", "B005CFBZVG", "B000P0J0EM", "B00BW4S8AC", "0792846443", "B008QE9Z8A", "B003L2M584", "B00D9EJG54", "B00003CXIP", "B002BE7JEI", "B0084MVE7E", "B000H4JH7Q", "B00006FDCU", "B003Y5H5FG", "B00C0EB9EU", "B00111YM5Q", "B00006JU81", "B000RZIGUE", "B00302QF72", "B0052XU4BK", "B0000YTOL2", "B00HRCBGRA", "B002AZTYPA", "B00DII0MGI", "B0047HXMXO", "B00DTPRZ10", "B003VA3JUO", "B00005K3NR", "B00111YM56", "0792842960", "B0088749FO", "B00009QG7O", "B002GHHHG0", "B0002J4ZX2", "B002VWNIDG", "B000RIWAV2", "B000099T3M", "B0021L9MJG", "B00009PY4C", "B000KB48B6", "B00013RC7K", "B0004Z31OS", "B0014VPFT0", "B002KH4KSY", "B0013527K2", "0783228449", "B00005JOJE", "B00GNAO70K", "B000ARFPMQ", "B00AKGG6XY"], "bought_together": ["B000G1R39E", "B00000F3SB"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000063US5", "B000WQWXB6", "B00005UQ9V", "B000G1R39E"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 70362}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.99, "brand": "JACKSON,JONATHAN", "asin": "B0007NFMB2", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51JPC3S43QL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Riding the Bullet (Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "If you spliced Charles Addams, Dr. Seuss, Charles Dickens, Edward Gorey, and Roald Dahl into a Tim Burtonesque landscape, you'd surely come up with something likeLemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events.

Along the way they encounter a herpetologist uncle (Billy Connolly), an anxious aunt (Meryl Streep) who's afraid ofeverything, and a variety of fantastical hazards and mysterious clues, some of which remain unresolved. Given endless wonders of art direction, costume design, and cinematography, Silberling's direction is surprisingly uninspired (in other words, the books are better), but when you add a throwaway cameo by Dustin Hoffman, Law's amusing narration, and Carrey's over-the-top antics, the firstLemonymovie suggests a promising franchise in the making.--Jeff ShannonA Message from Count OlafDear Adoring Fan of Count Olaf,Perhaps once every thousand years, a talent emerges that completely changes the way movies are made, orphans are orphaned, and heartthrobs throb. Often this talent has only one eyebrow, as is the case with one of the most cherished and admired actors scheming today. Surely you can you guess of whom I think.No, you fool! I am referring to the One...the Only...the Unbelievably Handsome Count Olaf!Or, as I like to call him, Me.If you&#x92;ve already seen my performance in Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events, you must still be speechless. But if you haven&#x92;t, you are in serious danger. Just teasing. But you could be after I send one of my gifted henchpersons to your home!So why not get my movie on DVD? This major motion spectacle has everything. Me, acting! Leeches, attacking! Orphans, almost falling off a cliff! Of course, if you are familiar with books by Lemony Snicket, you know that they include all of these things too, but most of what he says is lies, and the rest is completely boring.There's never been a film that demands repeated viewing in quite the same way, with a diabolical genius writing you a letter that says, \"I DEMAND REPEATED VIEWING!!!\" Plus with DVD extras, you&#x92;ll get at least 20% more Olaf for your money. And... just for you, for an unlimited time only, I&#x92;ll throw in Aunt Josephine free with purchase.*So, noble Amazonians, put down your hunting spears and exotic headdresses, and prepare to bask in True Greatness. Or, as I like to call it, Me.Of course you may have my autograph!Count Olaf*Count Olaf will not be held liable or accept blame in any way for any and all liability, loss, damage, or personal injury (including death), without limit and without regard once Aunt Josephine is thrown in, due to the unpredictable behavior of hungry leeches.Stills fromLemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events(Click to Enlarge)Violet, Count Olaf, and KlausAunt JosephineCount Olaf and Aunt JosephineDirecting Jim CarreyKlaus, Mr. Poe, Sunny, and VioletCount OlafOlaf AscendingThe Baudelaire OrphansAll Things SnicketSee a complete list of allLemony Snicket's creations, including books from theSeries of Unfortunate Events, calendars, and more.The Essential Lemony Snicket BooksA Series of Unfortunate Events: The Ominous Omnibus, Books 1-3The Situation Worsens: A Box of Unfortunate Events, Books 4-6The Dilemma Deepens: A Box of Unfortunate Events, Books 7-9The Slippery Slope: A Series of Unfortunate Events, Book 10The Grim Grotto: A Series of Unfortunate Events, Book 11A Library of Unfortunate Events, Books 1-10Behind the Scenes with Count Olaf: A Series of Unfortunate Events Movie BookLemony Snicket: The Unauthorized AutobiographyThe Puzzling PuzzlesActivity BookMore from the MovieOriginal Movie PosterSoundtrackWall PosterLemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate EventsComputer & Video GamesFor PS2For PCFor XboxFor GameCube", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEBB8KQ", "B001NPD9JA", "B000OYCM5I", "0061119067", "0061146331", "0061146315", "0061146307", "0064410161", "006055620X", "0060095563", "B0016Q2D5M", "B00009XUM5", "B0002W4UDE", "0064410153", "B00139W3NE", "0064408647", "0064407691", "0060586583", "B001LPWGBO", "0060839090", "0064410145", "B000Q66FB6", "B000G1R394", "B007R6DJP8", "006029809X", "B004M1A21K", "0060562250", "B000E8M0VA", "0064408655", "B0000VCZKW", "B00AEFZ6V4", "B00AEFY9RG", "B00AEBB8DI", "B000J10FLY", "0064410129", "B000GB5MH4", "B00AEFY8FO", "B001APZMJS", "0060566159", "B001HN694K", "0807219908", "B00H5NY7DQ", "B003HARV3Y", "B000C3L27U", "B0001I9YGW", "B004A8ZX3C", "0064408639", "B00005JPH2", "B00005JLOT", "B001DPHDCY", "0064408663", "B002ZG984Q", "B002ZG97F6", "0767836324", "B0000VCZKM", "B0000YTP02", "B005F96UJ6", "B000031EGV", "B00028HBES", "B003L20IJM", "B000M343BC", "B000ELJAEM", "B002WJI2QQ", "B002GHHHNS", "0783235070", "B004AKCME8", "B0000640SC", "B00081912E", "0807219916", "B000P0J09W", "B00IEXX4KS", "B0036TGSIK", "B00005JG6M", "0783225482", "B008QE9XD2", "B000QGDY0G", "B00AEFXJS6", "B000P0J0A6", "B00437IEI6", "6305123454", "B002JUFPX6", "B0006JMLRK", "B008JFUNTG", "B005LAIH4A", "B000AP04FG", "B0009NZ2KG", "B001QOGYAO", "B000BB1MI2", "B0014Z4OMU", "B000E6EHE0", "B002NZK5SW", "B00005JOWW", "0783219806"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0061146307", "B00AEBB8KQ", "B000OYCM5I", "0061119067"]}, "price": 13.47, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 48674}, "asin": "B0007PICAI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510HCJR3SCL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Lemony Snicket's a Series of Unfortunate Events (Full Screen Edition)"}

{"description": "He pops pills, watches soaps, and always, always says what's on his mind. He's Dr. Gregory House (Emmy nominee Hugh Laurie,Blackadder). Producers David Shore, Bryan Singer, Katie Jacobs, and Paul Attanasio haven't rewritten the hospital drama--at heart, it's a cross betweenSt. Elsewhere,ER, andC.S.I.--but they've infused a moribund genre with new life and created one of TV's most compelling characters. More than any previous medical procedural, it resembles Attanasio&#x92;s underratedGideon's Crossing, butHouseis lighter on its feet. As fascinating as he is, the show wouldn't work as well if it were all House all the time (that would be like Sherlock Holmes without Watson or Moriarty). Fortunately, he's joined by an intriguing cast of characters, portrayed by a combination of experienced vets (Omar Epps, Lisa Edelstein, Tony winner Robert Sean Leonard) and new faces (Jennifer Morrison, Jesse Spencer). Aside from the complicated cases they tackle each week, the sparks really fly when House's brilliant, if na&#xEF;ve charges are put to the test--and as the head of a teaching hospital, it's his job to test them (although his tough love approach is constantly landing him in hot water with Edelstein's administrator). From the first episode,Houseattracted a talented array of guests, including Robin Tunney (\"Pilot\"), Joe Morton (\"Role Model\"), and Patrick Bauchau (\"Cursed\") as Spencer&#x92;s father. In addition, Chi McBride and Sela Ward appear frequently (with Ward returning for the second season). Viewers who first watched these 22 episodes on Fox will be gratified to note that the music has survived the transition to disc, such as the Rolling Stones' \"You Can't Always Get What You Want,\" as featured in both the pilot and season finale (\"Honeymoon\"). The only apparent omission is the credit theme (Massive Attack's \"Teardrop\") from the pilot.--Kathleen C.

{"description": "Creepy, tense, and enigmatic, Renny Harlin'sMindhuntersis a grisly cross between Agatha Christie's whodunit classicAnd Then There Were Noneand Jonathan Demme's horrifyingThe Silence of the Lambs. An interesting ensemble cast, including Christian Slater (Windtalkers), Jonny Lee Miller (Melinda and Melinda), L.L. Cool J (Harlin'sDeep Blue Sea), and Kathryn Morris (television'sCold Case) portray promising FBI profilers-in-training. Val Kilmer plays their ambiguous instructor putting the candidates through their paces and leaving them for a weekend on a spooky island, where those who survive a terrifying exercise--penetrating the mind of a serial killer via elaborate clues--will go to the head of the class. The rules change, however, when the students themselves turn out to be victims, bumped off one after another, the survivors half-mad with suspicion and paranoia that the murderer is one of their own. The film's concept is sound even if the execution (so to speak) gets out of hand with problems of logic. Among other things, none of these characters could possibly find time to pull off some of the psychopath's more complicated killing rituals. Quibbles aside, however,Mindhuntersis particularly watchable if one is in the mood for a movie that plays mind games.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00008EY9G", "B00HLTD3ZW", "B002GHHHL0", "6305047456", "0783240295", "B00AEFYF2K", "B00022XE6S", "B003VA3JUO", "B004BR7XGM", "B00003CXSD", "B000C0Z93G", "B000R4SMCW", "B00IKM5LXG", "B00IKM5OCO", "B0000ALPFL", "B00005JKQS", "B000R348QW", "B00J11U54K", "B00JA3RVG4", "B00H1RMWYW", "6305505802", "B001ASIHZG", "B0007W7I4W", "6305922675", "B00AIBZMD6", "B009AMAJPA", "B00BEIYGT8", "B000056HPB", "6305090564", "B00005JMWP", "B000T28Q00", "B00009RDG9", "B00EZ50SGW", "B00003CXUP", "B0042FDCR2", "B00AEFY6PQ", "B00AEFXEGS", "B009HIKAN8", "B00005UQ9W", "B00JU949TK", "B0058ZPNBI", "B00151QYXU", "B00C7T0EPS", "B0006D3HGA", "B00DZH8H2S", "B00AEFYCW8", "6301971345", "B001CC7PLM", "B00005JD5M", "B00003W8NT", "B00BEIYIF0", "B001QOGYFO", "B002WSYLLM", "6304884400", "B000BUNZY2", "B0084NZEPG", "0790732149", "B00DZP1C2W", "B00003CXND", "B00003CXSP", "B002O3Z4WK", "B002NZK5RI", "B00BEJL6JK", "B00GICP7UW", "B00DWZHTOU", "B00AEFXPSK", "B003Y5H4SO", "B00022R9BE", "B003ASLJJU", "B000055Y0Y", "B00000IQVQ", "B0015OKWL2", "B00CX7EMM0", "B002AK9UPO", "B000MNOX8U", "B00AEBBA2W", "078322799X", "B001BP4K22", "B00HGB9NAY", "B002O3Z4ZW", "B002AT8KA6", "B000NQRR1Q", "B00005JKIP", "0790729334", "B00HOGBXS6", "B0018LX9SU", "B00005O5B5", "B00BLF9FOK", "B00AEBB9AA", "B007549W62", "B000BVM1S2", "B0000541TL", "B00HEPC0TS", "B00BTYOYG2", "B00275EHDM", "B00DMUFXOS", "B00003CXQG", "B000IJ79TS", "B008FCX2D2", "B00JL6L4WC"], "bought_together": ["B00008EY9G"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0671528904", "B00022XE6S", "B00008EY9G"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 47503}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 18.99, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B0009YA3OA", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51YtxsGY2sL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Mindhunters"}
{"description": "If the phrase \"Marcia Marcia Marcia!\" sends you into a giddy childhood reverie, then you'd better run out and getThe Brady Bunch - The Complete Third Season. Not only does this season feature that definitive episode--in which middle sister Jan fights to get out from under the shadow of her older sister Marcia--but several other all-time favorite episodes, including the one in which Peter's voice starts to change, threatening to wreck the potentially blazing career of the Brady Six musical group (presumably launched by producers feeling the heat fromThe Partridge Family). The show had found its tone and its creators crafted 23 perfectly calibrated visions of a domestic fantasyland, decked out in mini-skirts and bell-bottoms (check out Mrs. Brady's recurring paisley pantsuit, made of some fabric offensive to nature). Marcia turns into a diva when cast as Juliet in the school play; Greg loses a bet with Bobby and has to obey the little boy's every whim for a week; Jan has to wear glasses; Cindy yearns for a boyfriend--simple problems cheerfully solved by pithy moral lectures delivered by stern but loving parents.  Despite adolescent hormones, snug pants, and the occasional ungodly short-shorts, sex never rears its complicated head.Though ratings were modest during the series' five-year run, in syndication the show became a phenomenon. As divorce became increasingly common in the 1970s, perhaps this smoothly blended and impossibly functional family had an  irresistible appeal to kids from broken homes.  Though the Brady siblings--played by Barry Williams, Maureen McCormack, Christopher Knight, Eve Plumb, Mike Lookinland, and Susan Olsen--were a charismatic sextet, it's Florence Henderson and especially Robert Reed as Carol and Mike Brady, uber-parents, who giveThe Brady Bunchits familial glow. But everyone was the center of one episode or another; even Ann B. Davis dominated one episode as maid Alice's lookalike cousin, a WAC Master Sergeant who imposed military discipline on these lazy suburbanites. No matter how corny the jokes or how daffy the stories,The Brady Bunchcontinues to cast its hypnotic spell.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000B5XOUM", "B0009I7NH6", "B000CCBCHQ", "B0006Z2L4W", "B0007V6IWQ", "B00AEFXKIK", "B005M2A4CA", "B000B6CODY", "B0009B16TO", "B00AEBB98W", "B00DXLO0BI", "B000UX6TKM", "B000291Q3Y", "B00GOC75YW", "B007RMQ4HW", "B001DHE9FQ", "B0006BAWSI", "B00DXLO086", "B000M343AI", "B0072BNJ0I", "B000EQ45BU", "B0006N2F0E", "B000HC2LOE", "B000002OND", "B00009VRF0", "B00KBES386", "B0050MB5AC", "B004IK30RI", "B000UX6TL6", "B0002JZT5U", "B0000C2IVT", "B0001CNQUS", "B00005JNS8", "B00HVFA36I", "B0063FGERO", "B00I099K4U", "B000E1MXVO", "B001NY4X3W", "B0001DMXEC", "B000ASDFIQ", "B000IJ79VG", "B001E6JC26", "B0009OUBPQ", "B000C6NPHC", "B000E3L7FK", "B00465I1D8", "B001LM64VK", "B00A2L1CJK", "B001992NZG", "B00JAD6BYW", "B00FWMVVF4", "B00096S47G", "B0002I837M", "B007IX38J2", "B009X919YU", "B00096S480", "B00308B170", "B00B1LQB2S", "B00FM4S8IU", "B0000AUXVS", "B00005JO2V", "B000CELOV8", "B00DXLO0D6", "B000Z6GT18", "B000M343AS", "B000BT96OG", "B0025X4PBA", "B000291Q3O", "B00016JE5U", "B0001EFV9K", "B001B187C0", "B0009UC80Q", "B0001EQIBU", "B0007939QG", "B000EXZFS0", "B000EGDANO", "1442479337", "0967378508", "B00FFARI7I", "B000FQIRWC", "B001UDPA9M", "B0007Y08P6", "B000H1RFXM", "B00G5G7EXY", "B0000DFZ5O", "B000BB1MIW", "B001F7AQDS", "B00009QG5P", "B008VIMLRI", "B0007R4SWC", "B008TVXFPE", "B00005JLIC", "B000EMG90O", "B0058JEI06", "B0012Q3SZ0", "B0002VNYI2", "B0001EQICE", "B00HW3L9MG", "B0002XVQNK", "B00274SIVK"], "bought_together": ["B0009I7NH6", "B000B5XOUM"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0009I7NH6", "B000B5XOUM", "B000MGBSEY", "B0006Z2L4W"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 8601}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 12.99, "brand": "Paramount", "asin": "B000A0GORS", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51A91ZnpC4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Brady Bunch - The Complete Third Season"}

{"description": "The Man with the Screaming Brain is cult superstar Bruce Campbell (Evil Dead 2), who also makes his directorial debut in this loopy blend of '50s-style science fiction thrills and slapstick comedy. Campbell plays a businessman who meets an untimely end at the hands of a vicious Gypsy femme fatale, who has also done in her ex-fianc&eacute;e, an KGB-agent-turned-taxi-driver. Mad doctor Stacy Keach provides a solution for both men by stitching together their brains inside Campbell's dome; with no other option but to work together, the pair sent out to find their killer. What results is a broadly funny and frantic showcase for Campbell's physical comedy skills, with Ted Raimi (Spider-Man,Xena) offering hilarious support as Keach's wacky assistant. Campbell fanatics will appreciate the DVD's extras, which include a featurette on the film's lengthy gestation (18 years  from conception to completion), and commentary by Campbell and producer David Goodman; a trailer, behind-the-scenes footage, and storyboards round out the supplemental features.--Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000WC38FA", "B001KEGR5M", "B001KEGR5W", "B0001LQJMQ", "B000FJH5MC", "B000F7CMPE", "B000IJ7A5Q", "B001C0PFG6", "0312291450", "B005J9ZFQG", "B000WC3864", "0783227434", "031231261X", "B001KEGR7U", "B0016MJ6P6", "B0007WQHI0", "B0000ALPFL", "B005FRWU5Q", "B004ZBFRG2", "B0009JE6FM", "B0001US7OA", "B00IA1VQBS", "B005J9ZE5I", "B0058I9DZM", "B00004Z1GI", "B004GGU9K0", "B0025VLEMK", "B00L326LTI", "B00IF8Q0YE", "0312312601", "0312242646", "B003Z8ZC2U", "B0002C9DK4", "B00J0IQISG", "157362408X", "B00404ME2E", "B00C6F61IW", "B00HI9QDQ6", "B001BP14MG", "B002EOVXBK", "B000H5TH0W", "B008DVJNTW", "B008DVJOQ4", "B000HT3SA8", "B00F3L8P26", "6305428263", "B00CERJJ68", "B00HNTOVX8", "B0009KQP3C", "B00JHH1VSW", "B00FUABJJQ", "B00009YXHN", "B00026L7OU", "B0000E6FOO", "0783228457", "B00C0EQWRY", "B00005JOJP", "B004GGU9JQ", "B008B089RM", "B004EXWGJW", "B001Q8MMC4", "B0029RW0E6", "B001221DUQ", "B000068IEV", "B000099T3M", "B00DI012QA", "B000FS9FE4", "B005S2F8LQ", "B003BGZ61S", "B001AR0D5Y", "B00BXHDZ5Q", "B000H7JCFK", "B009IV2Z3M", "B000G6BLGK", "B0002V7TMY", "B002I41KNC", "B005NKIPUO", "B0088FS27C", "B0053TWW36", "B004BZ5AN2", "0790742004", "B00000IXPN", "B003IRUFCA", "B008JFUO0Y", "B00GHH9IIA", "B0007WFXNA", "B0000694WL", "B006LPHY5C", "B002T4GY3C", "B000068TPD", "B0000DC12T", "B000EOTV98", "B001AGNMFI", "6305258287", "B000SFJ4K4", "B008HSK3PE", "B007XF0XUW", "B00B0LKVIY", "B0091G7BTM", "B000274TLW"], "bought_together": ["B000WC38FA", "B001KEGR5M"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000F7CMPE", "B001KEGR5M", "B0001LQJMQ", "B005J9ZFQG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 51954}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.0, "brand": "", "asin": "B000AQ69QS", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61WYTKE0D4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Man with the Screaming Brain"}

{"description": "Horror buffs will surely be compelled to compare and contrastDominionwithExorcist: The Beginning, two films weirdly linked by film history. Director Paul Schrader shotDominiononly to find studio bosses underwhelmed by its horror aspects, at which point Renny Harlin was hired to direct another take on the subject with the same lead actor, setting, and similar storyline. That became the 2004 theatrical releaseExorcist: The Beginning.As expected, the Schrader version has more tortured religiosity and visual poetry than Harlin's cheesier (but admittedly gripping) re-do. Father Merrin (Stellan Skarsgard) carries his guilt from the Nazi occupation to a remote African archaeological dig, where a mysteriously buried church has been uncovered. Strange stuff happens nearby, and a fervent young priest (good performance by Gabriel Mann) parries spiritual points with the now-doubting Merrin. Some of the ideas are strong and the sun-and-sand cinematography by the great Vittorio Storaro is often stunning. As beautiful as the film is to look at, it must be admitted that the climax is disappointingly flat, the leading lady (Clara Bellar) is a washout, and one begins to yearn for the occasional genre shock of the kind Schrader was able to conjure up in his remake ofCat People. If you're anExorcistfan, watch it for its serious treatment of Merrin's crisis, which ties in to his character in the 1973 original.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00065HKLG", "B000067FP5", "B0000399W9", "B003UGLCIA", "B000HEWEGC", "B00KDU8HQQ", "B00HRUQ8X4", "B003L20IEW", "B00HRCBGRA", "B00HNTOVWE", "B00FYV7WCY", "B00DYRNGQ6", "B000BTJDGC", "B0029EW7BA", "B00IKM5LFY", "B004EPYZO4", "B00HHYF570", "B00EF0NY7W", "B001KKU9CI", "B00GJ7CUFG", "B001992NW4", "B003VE9WP6", "B00096S48U", "B00GHH9IIA", "B000AM4P9K", "B000099T3M", "B00EZ50SGW", "B00018D42W", "B000S0GYRU", "B000056T5E", "B00GDDNFDW", "B00D7AM5U8", "B00D7AM698", "B002LMSWN2", "B0085Z3AMW", "B0011NVC98", "B00452J5KU", "B000PMLJMQ", "B00DEQQK8S", "B00003CXCF", "B00D7AM5XU", "B0089N4G50", "B0000CDRVX", "B00009PY4G", "0783116926", "B00111YM5Q", "B00000IQVC", "B00CPTUNVA", "B00H9LHX8K", "6305718954", "B003SG8122", "B00004TS0G", "B000HCO86I", "B001TK80C0", "B001QB9H1U", "B00DI012O2", "B000Q66Q8I", "B009B8YNGO", "B00BWJQEFI", "B0000694XX", "B0002IQLH6", "B00AIBZM40", "B004B3PBFQ", "B00001TZ6Q", "B00AEFYYH6", "B0021L8UFI", "B00A50PDS4", "B000FA57UI", "B00BEJL6Q8", "B001P3SA9Y", "B0000AOX0A", "B000EHQTZO", "6301971345", "B00000K3TO", "B0000AOX09", "B00195FUDC", "0767817737", "B000QGEB1W", "B00A429Y9M", "B000QQJ3Q0", "B000EOTV98", "B000CNE0M4", "B00F98FOI6", "B00005JNTU", "B001OQCVI8", "0767847431", "B00000F3SB", "B00EZ50R04", "B001NPD9LS", "B001DJLD1W", "B00AWWX6XY", "B001KVZ6ES", "B002VWNIDG", "B00GDDNMEY", "B00HF98SY4", "B001CFLGYQ", "B000GCFO0I", "B001BNFRB2", "B0067QPVD2", "B00BEIYMAG"], "bought_together": ["B00065HKLG", "B000067FP5"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00065HKLG", "B0000399W9", "B000HEWEGC", "B003UGLCIA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 38870}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.51, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B000AYEL4W", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HpsR6nFNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Dominion - Prequel to the Exorcist"}

Like other private-eye shows of the 1970s (such asColumboand David Janssen'sHarry O), the series offered smart mystery plots in the hardboiled-sleuth traditions of Dashiell Hammett, Raymond Chandler, and Rex Stout, given a sunlit spin in contemporary California. But ex-convict turned private investigator Jim Rockford (who served time for a crime he didn't commit) was anything but a conventional gumshoe; for one thing, he rarely carried a gun, and resorted to violence only when he'd exhausted his options. As played to perfection by James Garner (in what would become his signature role, surpassing his previous success asMaverick), Rockford preferred wisecracks over violence, and his going rate (\"$200 a day, plus expenses\") was typically applied to cold cases, missing persons, and family disputes, frequently leading to entanglements with organized crime and L.A.P.D. Sergeant Dennis Becker (Joe Santos), whose friendship with Rockford lent the series one of its pivotal character relationships. As Rockford pursued the truth from his rusty trailer-home on the Pacific Coast Highway, his inherent warmth and compassionate sleuthing were further enhanced by engaging interplay with his retired ex-trucker father \"Rocky\" (Noah Beery, Jr.), his lawyer and on-and-off girlfriend Beth Davenport (Gretchen Corbett), and his weasely former cell-mate \"Angel\" Martin (Stuart Margolin), a trio of supporting players as memorably appealing as any in '70s television. As a loose-knit ensemble, they followed Garner's capable lead with intelligent dialogue (the best of it written by series cocreator Stephen J. Cannell and frequent contributor Juanita Bartlett) and occasionally burst of stunt-laden action, typically involving Rockford's expert driving of a versatile Pontiac Firebird. (As Garner fondly recalls in the disc 1 bonus interview, \"That car could do anything.\")With a catchy Mike Post theme song,The Rockford Filesbegan each week with a new message on Rockford's telephone answering machine, usually a humorous indication that Rockford's life was always in some kind of financial disarray. Garner played this angle to the hilt, portraying Rockford as a nice guy who knew all the scams and wasn't above using them if it aided his case. His portrayal, and the show's excellent writing, attracted a wide variety of new and established guest stars, and these 23 episodes (24 if you count the two-part \"This Case Is Closed,\" originally broadcast as one 90-minute episode) feature appearances by Joseph Cotten, James Woods, Sharon Gless, Lindsay Wagner, James Cromwell, Suzanne Somers, Ned Beatty, and others, along with lesser-known but familiar TV regulars like Sian Barbara Allen and Mills Watson, all adding flavor to a series that was routinely hailed by mystery writers as one of the best private-eye shows in TV history. Speaking of mysteries, one can only wonder why Universal failed to include the series' 90-minute pilot (originally aired in March 1974), and while this reviewer experienced no playback problems with these three double-sided DVDs (four episodes per side), many consumers have reported DVD freeze-ups likely resulting from lower-quality players less capable of handling high-compression DVDs. These caveats aside, season 1 ofThe Rockford Filesis a bona fide treat, setting the tone for even better episodes that followed in subsequent seasons.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000BF0C8E", "B000LXGXY8", "B000N2HD6O", "B000XJD3K2", "B001JFKWE4", "B002LFQIL2", "B007AAF3FK", "B00B00HUC0", "B00005JMHI", "B00005JO3P", "145164261X", "B0013D8M4E", "B00JZYJ7F6", "B00DDT0JB0", "B004ZRFQCG", "B00ELMZ60M", "B00DYQ1G78", "B00FNRA0KA", "B0003JAOCC", "B002GHHHP6", "B00005JN9P", "B001DDBD4K", "B00007GZR1", "B00005JNHT", "B0007LXP86", "B00IMRL4BC", "0792838408", "B000ASDFIG", "B000BUE5DC", "B000JJSJPK", "B00507O3II", "B00008G7QH", "B00CMB8DP4", "B00006SFKE", "B00KLEYXZS", "B0007TKNGU", "B007XTDWKQ", "B008RJ6TTC", "B000LE16VC", "B00005JNHS", "B004CTG6TO", "B000GW8UAE", "B00EQ2KU7G", "B00936A1ZG", "B00ALTQRNO", "B0029B31HM", "B000HWZ4HU", "B00AMU8K8C", "B0007CNY4K", "B000BUE5CI", "B00CLH0848", "B00018D3RI", "B0002COTDA", "B00368PSKK", "0790731460", "B002XDR5NM", "B00H3L86F0", "B000056H2F", "B000EQ46H8", "B000YKYT1M", "B0029778T8", "B004DSCPRQ", "B001J0FVYK", "B000N6UF10", "B000QUU7KC", "B005TFVM0I", "B0007KIFK0", "B00KTZALDC", "B000FFJYCU", "B000F7CMPE", "B00GOC74QG", "B00005AUKC", "B00LT1JHLW", "B003AWRMBA", "B00JHH1VUU", "B00E3QJ7ZG", "B000YENUOK", "B000MGBSIK", "B004SEUJOQ", "B00BMJ7ZKG", "B004EXWGHY", "039916930X", "B00DXLO0D6", "B00DXLO086", "B004EPYZV2", "B00BMKGZVA", "B00BN3DZZA", "B00DYQ1GBE", "B00KTFJ6J2", "B00DJYJRHG", "B00JEZWRE4", "630560097X", "B00ITAQ2T6", "B00HGE90Z4", "B00915G6MG", "B00K6D1S7A", "B000683VI4", "B00GTZWXYQ", "B00FEP9MYG", "B009EAAL60"], "bought_together": ["B000BF0C8E", "B000LXGXY8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000N2HD6O", "B000XJD3K2", "B002LFQIL2", "B007AAF3FK"]}, "price": 12.49, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 258}, "asin": "B000BGR1B4", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51K9RTBGV8L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Rockford Files - Season One"}
{"description": "The teaming of Johnny Knoxville (Jackass: The Movie) and Seann William Scott (Dude, Where's My Car?) as well as the presence of the '70s-flavored car chases that were a specialty of the TV series guarantees thatThe Dukes of Hazzardwill be even more lowbrow than the CBS TV series (1979-85) that inspired it. However, this brain-damaging comedy is more \"rehash\" than \"remake,\" as good ol' Georgia boys Luke Duke (Knoxville) and his cousin Bo (Scott) are frequently upstaged by the General Lee, the Confederate-flagged '69 Charger that they drive, jump, race, and fly in as they smuggle moonshine for their Uncle Jesse (Willie Nelson). Meanwhile, cousin Daisy Duke (Jessica Simpson) is reliably available to model her short-shorts (aka \"Daisy Dukes\") and awesome figure (and let's face it, Simpson's talents pretty much begin and end right there), while corrupt honcho Boss Hogg (Burt Reynolds, who should know better) recruits a local NASCAR star to advance his wily scheme of converting Hazzard County into a strip mine. Director Jay Chandrasekhar (Super Troopers) manages to mine some good-natured humor from the movie's oval-track detour and a few colorful supporting players (notably Kevin Hefferman as the Duke's pal Sheev). Otherwise, consider yourself warned:The Dukes of Hazzardis shameless Hollywood product at its most forgettable, trafficking in shameless white, rural Southern stereotypes. If you can make it to the end, there's a blooper reel to reward your endurance.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000M7FOO8", "B0014VPFM2", "B0072BNKIO", "B000LC3ICE", "B0006BAWR4", "B0007XG26G", "B0009S4IM4", "B00024JC4E", "B000BB1MJ6", "B000HLDF9U", "B000EMG90O", "B000HLDFA4", "B000IZJZIU", "B0009XBIMM", "B000EMGJAO", "B000EGDBZ6", "B001LMAK5Q", "B00004Z4WR", "B005KL76BK", "B000L4WWJM", "B000JJ4DNW", "B004MTTZIS", "B002Q6QBI6", "B000YGGNGA", "B000274T94", "B004GF9W0O", "B0002V7TMY", "B0010VZ91I", "B001L9EXTS", "B00005JLYW", "B000E6EHE0", "B001F0TT60", "B000HQ4GWA", "B00016MSV2", "B003VRJ89S", "B00007AJGM", "B0009HBPN0", "B004EPZ084", "B004QL7K70", "B001OD4S50", "B00AEFYZCU", "B0002W4UDE", "B00BCNXOWA", "B00AEFXVW0", "B0015XHP2C", "B00AEFYS2M", "B00AEFZ3XU", "B0050PYNP8", "B0009ZE9VW", "6302077818", "B000069CF0", "B00008WI9O", "B004EPZ0BG", "B00AEBB9UU", "B00AEFZ7F4", "B0026BXHQ0", "B001ILHY1I", "B000EQHXOG", "B000J4P9P8", "B004OEIL5E", "B0084F5ISW", "B00003CXPS", "B001CD6FKI", "630529142X", "B008RNYMG0", "B004DTLKCG", "B00AEFXR1K", "B00EE41S8G", "B000BBOUW2", "B007A2Z19G", "B000E8QVWY", "B004GTVU6O", "B002ZG970G", "B00002SSKG", "B000Y7U93C", "B000083C6I", "B002ZG998G", "B00008L3W3", "B00BTYU3QW", "B00363WGBO", "B00153ZRHW", "B004IK30R8", "B000B7QCRM", "B000RGX0DQ", "B005LAIH9A", "B0015U0QVW", "B00005BIU7", "B003Y5H5B0", "0767802497", "0783227396", "B00008EYA5", "B00003GPFT", "B0006FO8E8", "B000VKL6Z2", "B00AEFXPSK", "B00E1HIWU8", "B000059MQQ", "B000FA57US", "B000Y7U94G", "B0053FANT0"], "bought_together": ["B000M7FOO8", "B0014VPFM2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0014VPFM2", "B0072BNKIO", "B0006BAWR4", "B001PU8MY0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 96992}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.04, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B000BKJ74Y", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51EXOf%2BfISL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Dukes of Hazzard (PG-13 Full Screen Edition)"}

{"description": "Director Stuart Gordon picked an H.P. Lovecraft story for his installment of Showtime'sMasters of Horrorseries. So what did you expect? This filmmaker gained his horror-movie spurs with his wild and wonderful Lovecraft flicksRe-AnimatorandFrom Beyond(following up years later with another H.P. tale, the fishyDagon), so nothing could be more super-natural. For his hour-long episode, Gordon choseDreams in the Witch House, which follows a student (Ezra Godden) at Miskatonic University (that's Lovecraft's frequently-mentioned fictional school) as he moves into a suspiciously cheap boarding house. When he has intense nightmares about a rat with a human face, it should be a warning sign, but the student is mightily attracted to a single mom at the house, played by the mighty attractive Chelah Horsdal. Some acceptable mood-setting comes courtesy of Godden's elderly downstairs neighbor, and the half-dozen shocks are just fine. Somehow the straight-line story disappoints, as the ultimate outcome of it all seems fairly obvious from the opening scenes, and there's nothing much to complicate the slide into evil. Still, this episode merits a passing grade by the strict standards of Miskatonic U.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000067J0M", "B003V6XDP4", "B000PWQP9I", "B0085X315U", "B000FS2W3A", "B000E5KUME", "B000KJTFBG", "B000GI3RHY", "B000FS2W3K", "B000ERVKLW", "B000LPS47K", "B00KCTG4PO", "B006LMRMMA", "B000RL21PO", "8598310042", "B000GB5M2O", "B000RIWAV2", "157347049X", "B000F3UACK", "B0000DC12T", "B00005K3OC", "B00AJXO4FA", "B000RPCK2O", "B008CYDD7I", "B00009YXHN", "B000UR9QXK", "B008CYDDWI", "B000A6T1ZO", "B00009PY4D", "B002FLOTPO", "B000RL21OK", "B00B8O4WQA", "B00153HMF2", "B000WC38FU", "B000FA57WG", "B000FA57W6", "161696121X", "B000S1MMCK", "B00480PTWM", "B00DBNLAZW", "B000S1MMCU", "B00DOZNGTK", "B000UDGOAC", "B000GB5M2Y", "B00HHYGGBE", "B000UYX4P4", "B00K0MM4AM", "1934501050", "B000S0GYRU", "B000BQTC98", "B000F3UACU", "B00FM4S68W", "B000KJTFB6", "B000OYCMO4", "0142437956", "B00GSTHBTK", "B00005RHGK", "B006QWC2ZC", "B004X63SCY", "B001CW7ZWG", "B000GIXCM4", "B001MEJY8W", "B00D7AM5XU", "B000F0UUKK", "078062856X", "B000OUNXGO", "B00C7C00R2", "B005J9ZFQG", "B00BMUL6J6", "B00003CXLS", "B0000542CO", "B00977HRSK", "B0043VUHV4", "B00008974O", "B000795JMS", "B007Y1NNAW", "B00000K3TO", "B004EI2NPO", "B000NY0YJA", "B009EUVXZI", "1616617667", "B000WC3864", "B000RPCJ9I", "B00HT2RTU6", "B005JJCMOO", "B000MV8ZCW", "B000FFJZO2", "B0015U0QNK", "B0088FS1DC", "B00003CXCF", "B002LMSWN2", "0062082841", "B003ZEQMH8", "B00G7RON2Q", "B0015U0QO4", "B001EN5I4U", "B0009RQRT2", "B000VLLYGC", "B00CJF9T6A", "B0000A4GGF"], "bought_together": ["B000067J0M", "B003V6XDP4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003V6XDP4", "B000067J0M", "8598310042", "B000RL21N6"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 47257}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 4.58, "brand": "STARZ/SPHE", "asin": "B000E5KUMO", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5195J21DRVL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Masters of Horror - Stuart Gordon - Dreams in the Witch House"}

{"description": "A much-needed DVD tribute to one of the essential American playwrights,The Tennessee Williams Collectiongathers six Williams titles and one vintage documentary. Taken together, it's a potent introduction to the specific terrain (geographical and emotional) of this brilliant writer. The set is anchored by Warner's deluxe two-disc treatment ofA Streetcar Named Desire, which has copious extras (among them a fine 90-minute documentary about director Elia Kazan). The multi-Oscar-winningStreetcaris one of the better stage adaptations in film history, and it captures the electrifying Marlon Brando, re-creating his stage role, in the part that changed American acting:  the brutish New Orleans sensualist Stanley Kowalski. Vivien Leigh won an Oscar opposite him, as the faded (except in her own mind) Southern belle Blanche DuBois, whose arrival in the Kowalski home leads to disaster.Kazan also directedBaby Doll, which Williams scripted from a couple of one-act plays. This outrageous sex comedy casts the excellent Carroll Baker as the 19-year-old wife of middle-aged Karl Malden, who anxiously awaits the day he can finally consummate his maddening marriage; immigrant cotton magnate Eli Wallach shows up at Malden's crumbling plantation house just in time to take the bloom off the rose, as it were. Famous for being condemned in 1956,Baby Dollremains a very modern (and gloriously dirty) movie.Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, directed by Richard Brooks, faithfully brings three of Williams's indelible characters to the screen, even if the script discreetly changes the original stage text:  the hot Maggie the Cat (Elizabeth Taylor), her reluctant husband Brick (Paul Newman), and Brick's rich Big Daddy (Burl Ives). All three performers act the lights out.Sweet Bird of Youthreunites Paul Newman with director Brooks, and also showcases Geraldine Page's performance as an aging film star tagging along with young stud Newman to his Southern home town. Some of Williams' more depraved touches are toned down, but the milieu is unmistakable and the movie is intense.The Night of the Iguanagives Richard Burton perhaps his finest hour onscreen:  as Williams' dissolute defrocked priest, playing tour guide in Puerto Vallarta to tour groups of nattering biddies. The movie has director John Huston's sympathy for life's losers, as well as a trio of women built to torment Burton's reverend:  Ava Gardner, Deborah Kerr, and Sue Lyon.The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone, based on Williams's novel, is not a great movie, but gives Vivien Leigh a good workout as a wounded actress dallying with Italian gigolo Warren Beatty.Tennessee Williams' Southis a 1973 documentary featuring some marvelous observations from Williams, as he holds court for filmmaker Harry Rasky.

When the president is killed during his watch, Alex is wracked with guilt. Plucky investigative reporter Kate Crawford (Angie Harmon fromLaw & Order) convinces him that the gunman didn't act alone and that a conspiracy theory in this case is valid. Gooding plays his role with quiet reserve, a 180-degree departure from his over-the-top Oscar-winning performance inJerry Maguire. Harmon displays charm as the award-winning and highly unrealistic journalist. And Burt Reynolds shows up for a few minutes here and there to chew up the scenery as a general who may or may not be a rogue agent. Directed and co-written by Andy Cheng, the film has some thrilling action sequences. But its plot is transparent and when the mastermind behind the assassination is revealed, no one will be surprised.--Jae-Ha Kim", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000ELL1Q2", "B004P3ENLA", "B000ENUYH2", "B001DSNEJW", "B0000640RV", "6305432317", "B001HY3B3Q", "B004EP43SM", "B001UNVDWA", "B00596WEVI", "B0085Z3ABI", "B0048LVDIU", "B0058ZPNBI", "B002UPQ22S", "B00IKM5OCO", "B000HRMAUY", "B0090EDEM8", "B002MJV77C", "B00AIBZMD6", "B000H5TH0M", "B000EAT232", "B009AMAJPA", "B0010YVCB6", "B001AR011A", "B000FI8MPM", "B00DU22OI6", "B009HIKAN8", "B005NKIPUY", "B00001U0DU", "B00JA3RVG4", "B0009VRHM4", "B000F6IOCA", "B00GMV8IVE", "B00HOGBXS6", "B008A6QC08", "B00AG51V8E", "B000NOIVT0", "B004ULNJIU", "B00EIXWMII", "B00FKONA1M", "B00DI0135K", "B004HO6HWA", "B00D3LA63Y", "B00BB67UNW", "B00JU949TK", "B000X1Z0C4", "B00BEIYHO2", "B008E70EES", "B006GL8NGU", "B00FFT19XS", "B007EQR0D8", "B00BUC4TJ0", "B004BR7XGM", "B00009QG6G", "B005LAIILM", "B000A5043S", "B00B9UEOPC", "B00BNH9NCU", "B00A2H9P98", "B00A47BT7C", "B00JVLGL2A", "B00DZP1C2W", "B00BEIYLO8", "B000VECACQ", "B00BUAEYVK", "B000PISZ7M", "B00HF98SPS", "B00083FZEU", "B004O8OLO0", "B000E33VY0", "B00A4TMLNG", "B00C4BDG7W", "B000BRBA92", "B000CQ98FA", "B00H47IXF6", "B005LAIGRS", "B005Z9MFCM", "B00FRILRL6", "B00466H37M", "B00HGJAPYO", "B00AEFXEGS", "B0002IQMAM", "B008JFUNHI", "B00BEIYIK0", "B001BP4K22", "0783229402", "B00DL48BM6", "B0009FU0ZG", "B000N3T0E6", "B003R4ZMPE", "B001MZ5W3M", "B0062P3392", "B00B6OEB18", "B002WSYLLM", "B000FGGE68", "B00DW5IL2E", "B001AR010Q", "B000ALM40I", "B000P0I4O4"], "bought_together": ["B000ELL1Q2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["6305432317", "B0048LVDIU", "B002UPQ22S", "B004P3ENLA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 118541}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.15, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B000ENUYGS", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RNHCPPYXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "End Game"}

{"description": "Anyone with a fondness for the classic Warner Bros. gangster pictures--and those classic character actors who seemed to show up in every movie the studio made--should relish this cheerful late-'30s takeoff on the genre. Edward G. Robinson exuberantly sends up his own \"Little Caesar\" image, playing a beer baron named Remy Marco who made a dishonest fortune during Prohibition and craves respectability as a legitimate businessman once beer becomes legal again. Problem is, he's no longer the sole source of suds, and as nobody has ever had the heart to tell him, his product tastes like varnish. What's more, just as the bank is about to foreclose on his brewery, he finds that his summer vacation home upstate is inconveniently full of fresh gangland corpses....Based on a play by Howard Lindsay and \"guys and dolls\" chronicler Damon Runyon, and helmed by one of Warners' zippiest directors, Lloyd Bacon,A Slight Case of Murderfeatures a trio of delicious lugs--Allen Jenkins, Edward Brophy, and Harold Huber--as Marco's house staff and the hilarious Ruth Donnelly as his blowsy wife, with an affected upper-crust accent that keeps slipping. Add a supporting cast of characters with monikers like Innocence, No-Nose Cohen, Douglas Fairbanks Rosenbloom, and Sad Sam the Bookie, and you should be one happy citizen.--Richard T.

{"description": "TheAce Ventura Deluxe Double Featureoffers bothPet DetectiveandWhen Nature Callsin anamorphic widescreen with soundtracks in Dolby 5.1 and (not indicated on the packaging) DTS.   The original DVD ofPet Detectivewas full-screen (1.33 aspect ratio) only, though it had a scene with Ace masquerading as Hans Kissvelvet, the dolphin trainer, that was dropped from the theatrical release.  The deluxe edition is missing this scene.  The deluxe edition also has a third disc with three episodes (about 70 minutes total) from the 1995-96Ace Venturaanimated series with Michael Hall as the voice of Ace.--David HoriuchiAce Ventura: Pet Detectivewas the 1994 box-office hit that turned comedy maniac Jim Carrey into Hollywood's first $20-million man.  This gag-filled no-brainer stars Carrey as the titular rubber-faced gumshoe who tracks down lost pets for his heartbroken clients. Ace's latest case involves the apparent kidnapping of the Miami Dolphins' team mascot, Snowflake the dolphin (natch), and his investigation is a source of constant irritation for Miami police lieutenant Lois Einhorn (Sean Young).Friendsfans will appreciate the presence of Courtney Cox, who remains admirably straight-faced as the Dolphins' publicist and Ace's would-be girlfriend, but of course it's Carrey who steals the show with shameless abandon.--Jeff ShannonInWhen Nature Calls, the inevitable sequel, the disappearance of a rare African white bat, draws Ace (Carrey again) out of his spiritual retreat at a Tibetan monastery following the tragic outcome of his previous case. That traumatic experience, which makes for a hilarious opening-scene send-up of the Stallone thrillerCliffhanger, prompts Ace to venture to Africa, where he goes native with the tribe that hired him to find their symbolic bat. From that point anything goes, with Carrey pushing the boundaries of good taste (what, you were expecting good taste?) up to and including his now-infamous \"birth\" scene from the backside of a mechanical rhinoceros.

{"description": "The sixth and final season of HBO's prison dramaOz--which aired in 2003--is brutal, passionate, and gritty. Compellingly addictive with taut storylines and superb acting, each of the eight episodes on this 3-disc set nicely paves the way for the series finale, which wraps the show up in a satisfying (and surprising) manner. Often told through the eyes (and voice) of deceased prisoner Augustus Hill (Harold Perrineau,Lost),Ozisn't an easy show to watch. Inmates are routinely raped, tortured, and killed--not out of need, but out of boredom and cruelty. And in a corrupt system where too few bureaucrats actually care about these men's lives, few are willing to do anything about it. Those that do give a damn--Sister Peter Marie (Rita Moreno,West Side Story), Father Mukada (B.D. Wong,Law & Order: Special Victims Unit), Dr. Nathan (Lauren Velez), Warden Glynn (Ernie Hudson), McManus (Terry Kinney)--face an uphill battle.One of the strongest storylines is the ongoing romance between murderer Keller (Christopher Meloni,Law & Order: SVUand Beecher (Lee Tergesen), who's hoping to be paroled. Series creator Tom Fontana doesn't allow their arc to be diluted by any idealistic expectations. The viewer is acutely aware that Beecher is an easy target for annihilation whether or not he is released from prison. The viewer is never quite as certain of Keller's motives--whether they're borne of love and affection, or a selfish need to satisfy his own primal urges. Like Beecher, Alvarez (Kirk Acevedo) is trying to keep his own nose clean in the hopes that he'll be eligible for parole three years down the line. It's easy to understand the almost suffocating feeling he lives every day, knowing that three years may as well be a lifetime when you're behind bars and the target of both your former gang and the Aryan brothers, led by Schillinger (J.K. Simmons,Law & Order: SVU, theSpider-Manfilms). And Ryan (Dean Winters) desperately tries to save his mentally retarded brother Cyril (played by Dean's real-life sibling Scott William Winters) from being executed.There are a few subplots that don't ring true, such as the quasi romance between a librarian (Patti LuPone) and one of the prisoners, and an elderly inmate's (Joey Grey) implausible death wish. And for all the constraints the majority of convicts face, some appear to have almost free run of the prison. Still, Fontana has created a vivid, dark world where the occasional acts of humanity are as important as the non-stop chaos that is Oz. While it certainly helps to have seen the previous five seasons of the series to enjoy this season, it's not mandatory. These last eight episodes work fine as a stand-alone piece of drama.--Jae-Ha Kim", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0009GV9E6", "B00031TYBC", "B0000Y40PW", "B00000FBH2", "B00005Y6YJ", "0060521333", "B00A2JP6V2", "B000QXDJLI", "B00123BY6S", "B00316DDYA", "B0007R4SWM", "B004YOEDR4", "B00G4EWNCO", "B000FTCLSU", "B0001KL5DA", "B0006IUD9Y", "B0002ERXC2", "B00G4EWJ1O", "B0015TX2LO", "B005NFJAWG", "B000067S1G", "B000UX6TK2", "B005SEDI5M", "B00EEDNR9A", "B00HW3EXCE", "B0013FSL16", "0783230338", "B002FLOTPE", "B0007YMVWO", "B0020TS5EM", "B00B52F278", "B001PQZYQI", "B00DJYJRHG", "B0060MYKYY", "B0009NZ2W4", "B004BZ5AHI", "B00EIL7E9C", "B0001O3YLM", "B003PIUBZS", "B003CN5SAY", "B0015I2S7E", "B007TBIUSM", "B002AMVEDI", "B0012CJQZ0", "B00FYL08RK", "B00008PW1F", "B002AMVED8", "B00ADQPB50", "B008PJZDXW", "B00C8CQRQ4", "B00003CXOP", "B0002I84JO", "B000EHSVMS", "B00005NOHO", "B001AQBGM4", "B004YM6JSW", "B00F9F1K8W", "B00DXP7L88", "B002XUL6RG", "B0024FAD9C", "B0009IW88K", "B002N57KGM", "B003XWEQ8E", "B000V86OKG", "B000Q6GUW0", "B00166UFSY", "B000002MUG", "B0036TGTF2", "B0012CJQYQ", "B000FFJYE8", "B0024FAD92", "B0055SNHQG", "B00005JNOG", "B00GST8PHW", "B0092Q82LC", "B003UD7J6W", "B0032JTV6A", "B0058YPG1G", "B0015ABRE2", "B00FEP9MYG", "B003L77GRO", "B000NVT0UM", "B00HI4EGQA", "B0024FAR4I", "B00HQVB0Q4", "B0089J2926", "B006CR2OOA", "B00124ONGA", "B007HOQ5FQ", "B00915G6WQ", "B003L77GTC", "B009TE9GNK", "B00JF5G8WU", "B00021R7E4", "B000FS9MY2", "B00HUCF6KK", "B001KKU9D2", "B0012CJQY6", "B0042L0OFY"], "bought_together": ["B0009GV9E6", "B00031TYBC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0000Y40PW", "B00000FBH2", "B00005Y6YJ", "B0009GV9E6"]}, "price": 22.96, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 44664}, "asin": "B000G1R4TS", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51-AjbLxssL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Oz: Season 6"}

From acclaimed director Spike Lee comes the edge-of-your-seat, action-packed thriller that The Wall Street Journal calls \"a heist film that's right on the money.\"", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JPD0", "B0000VJG72", "B00005JN0W", "B005LAIGRS", "B002LMV7R0", "B002CPMB9O", "B000244GCC", "B002VWNIEA", "B002ZG997C", "B00005JKWX", "B002XMGGK6", "B0019EXZY4", "078324228X", "B0050MB4OO", "B003L20IG0", "0783240295", "B004A8ZX28", "B002DU39GW", "6304765258", "B0010HOZW6", "B001V7UTV6", "B0006210ZG", "B00AFEXRME", "B00AEBB86A", "6304884400", "B005LAIGLE", "B00AEBB8LA", "B003BV8I3Q", "B002AT8K9W", "B00005JN2Z", "B000BYY11Y", "B00BEIYN9Q", "B004EPYZP8", "B00JA3RVG4", "B001BP4K22", "B002ZG99TA", "B001UV4XRY", "B000P0J0AG", "B000OT6V0K", "B00005JNQA", "B000N6TX1I", "B001N44BVQ", "B00005JA9F", "B007EQR0D8", "B00AEFXT1S", "B00005V9HH", "B00102F5WK", "B000XA5K48", "B0000ACOXL", "B002ZG99N6", "B002GHHHN8", "B00096S49Y", "B00015YVDG", "B000FFL2G6", "B0045HCJFS", "B00008K7AO", "B0000B1OFL", "B00005UQ9T", "B008E70EES", "B000M341QE", "B000I2J736", "B000JYW5BE", "B000MZHW40", "0783226888", "B0012QCZ5O", "B000CQLZ0Q", "B002AT8KAG", "B004XQO90O", "B003Z94WBG", "B007C4ZJ0S", "B002ZG980U", "B000NA1WEK", "B000MXPE7O", "B000FKO5QK", "B0007W7I4W", "6305428115", "B000LC55F2", "B00011CZRE", "B00AEFXBPM", "B000R4SMCW", "B000Y7WGOW", "B000069HZP", "B002ZG999U", "B000K7VHQ4", "B00005JLWN", "B000OYAT3U", "B003ASLJIQ", "B003Q6D2B4", "B002UZCJ8Y", "B00562I40K", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B009HIKAN8", "B00005JKIP", "B00005JLX2", "B00BNH9NCU", "B00BTYOYG2", "B000FS9FCG", "B002ZG97RE", "B0037X40SA", "B00005JLSB"], "bought_together": ["B005LAIGRS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005LAIGRS", "B00005JPD0", "B002CPMB9O", "B00005JN0W"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 137419}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.99, "brand": "WASHINGTON,DENZEL", "asin": "B000GFLKEY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516AC6QFWDL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Inside Man (Full Screen Edition) (2006)"}

{"description": "Equal partsRomeo and JulietandCrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,Shinobioffers breathtaking cinematography, appealing actors, and ninjas. What more could a movie fan ask for? Released in 2005,Shinobiis set in 17th century Japan, which is dominated by two powerful clans. Oboro is a member of the Iga clan, while her lover Gennosuke is the son of the leader of the Koga clan. Both groups are comprised of expert ninjas who have developed skills unknown to most mortals. When Oboro and Gennosuke meet, they are unaware that by their birthrights, they are meant to hate--not love--each other. When the nefarious Shogun--eager to increase his own power by doing away with both clans--announces that each faction will send in five ninjas to fight to the death, Oboro and Gennosuke are sent in to battle against each other for the honor of their clans. Filled with action (including some computer-generated images to enhance the actors' warrior-like qualities) and romance,Shinobihas the makings of a sweeping epic. Though based on an anime series, the film succeeds as a stand-alone piece of work. Beautifully filmed and well-acted, the film is exciting and heartbreaking, and the viewer senses both hope and doom all the way through the finale.--Jae-Ha Kim", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002BWD74G", "B001AZIRWW", "B004DMIIUU", "B002KYIAKQ", "B0043988KS", "B0019PL2W0", "B006C1S1DY", "B00G3HOJZ6", "B000UAEBFK", "B008XEZXES", "B00B209RHY", "B006H3KQSK", "B001MEJY9G", "B000ICLU7C", "B004XQO8MS", "B0056OZI0W", "B008IG0B0C", "B000MRA592", "B000IMUYM4", "B002C6VMIY", "B0030A6ICG", "B00104AYGK", "B0007Q6VXC", "B009VL2AZM", "B0002ZYE64", "B00065GX0K", "B0016LHH62", "B004SIP88Y", "B000F2CAJ2", "B000E1EHPE", "B008OTTRE4", "B005FQ1OOK", "B004VW4V9E", "B0002Y4T4M", "B00003CXR4", "B009VL2A5M", "B004DMIIO6", "B005F96UHI", "B005F96UGO", "B00B4MMVVY", "B00576U9HQ", "B0012SY0E6", "B000FS9FIK", "B0018PH3NS", "B004H2CXBQ", "B0056OZI0M", "B00B6OEE7O", "B005E7SEZW", "B005M9VSMI", "B00C3ALL9O", "B0002IQHAW", "B001L67A4G", "B00GXFZOYI", "B000EE3FUY", "B008FIPRGG", "B002P7UCJK", "B003DVB7F0", "B00ENTX7JU", "B00009V7OB", "B00DJ5IORY", "B001F34HT6", "B00B1CGFD2", "B006L4MWVE", "B0056OZI16", "B000GBEWNY", "B0033HKDXG", "B0055CP9EK", "B0016MJ6JC", "B008645YLM", "B003YOZNFQ", "B003G715IK", "B000GFLKDU", "B00GS19OOS", "B005ZMBEXU", "B00687XNNK", "B004P2VQZ2", "B0000U0X1Q", "B002KYIAL0", "B0010X740K", "B000MM0LEG", "B0051SFTGQ", "B006MWA91A", "B0010X741O", "B00H47IXJW", "B00011V8JA", "B000P6R9N0", "B0013XZ6RU", "B0009VBTQY", "B0054YCDKM", "B00009RXI6", "B000JVSUXO", "B001R10BDW", "B00518HB4O", "B00518HB0S", "B00FEHCQEC", "B004TFTE9A", "B003LN0NXC", "B0058M0848", "B00HSJ2EMI", "B004KDYR7A"], "bought_together": ["B002BWD74G", "B001AZIRWW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004DMIIUU", "B002KYIAKQ", "B000FS9FIK", "B0043988KS"]}, "price": 9.81, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 87890}, "asin": "B000HXDWOG", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZXJHEFABL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Shinobi - Heart Under Blade"}

{"description": "Here are three films that couldn't and wouldn't have been made at any other time.  Contrary to popular belief, the history of Hollywood permissiveness, what filmmakers could \"get away with\" on screen, is not a steadily rising graph from puritanical early days to the party-hearty present.  In the early 1930s, a national mood of shock over the stock market crash and impatience with Prohibition licensed a relaxation of the movie industry's self-censorship policies.  Sexuality--always a driving force in movie plots and characterizations, even when repressed--became a more explicit presence, with costuming that sometimes pushed the envelope for exposure of epidermis and dialogue that could be shockingly blunt.Baby Face(1933) was made at Warner Bros., the golden-age studio with the grittiest style and the most street cred.  The gutsy Barbara Stanwyck stars as a young woman from a factory town who hops a boxcar to the big city and sleeps her way to the top--a progress famously indexed by a camera ascending floor by floor outside a Gotham office building as she trades up, one corporate suitor after another.  No other major-studio film was more explicit about sex as a tool and a commodity, yetBaby Faceis curiously lesssexythan any number of movies that weren't so outspoken about it.  This TCM collection features both the theatrical-release version familiar for decades and a recently rediscovered preview version that is markedly superior, runs five minutes longer, and includes more sexual liaisons.  It also happily lacks an absurd final scene that got tacked onto the release version to explain how the heroine learned to be content with a modest lifestyle.Red-Headed Woman(1932) is arguably the raunchiest movie Jean Harlow made at MGM (though not as raunchy as her scenes in Howard Hughes' 1930Hell's Angels).  Unlike Stanwyck inBaby Face--a proletarian heroine grimly selling herself to beat capitalism and the patriarchy at their own game--Harlow's character brazenly relishes both the sex and the posh life it wins for her.  The lion's share of this sardonic comedy, scripted by Anita Loos and an uncredited F. Scott Fitzgerald, focuses on Harlow's seduction of her married boss (Chester Morris) and the havoc she wreaks in his upper-crust world. Charles Boyer has a role (his first Hollywood credit) as a French chauffeur who knows how to give satisfaction, and the film's air of breezy ribaldry even allows the star a casual flash of bare breast.The rarest item in the collection, the 1931 Universal version ofWaterloo Bridge, has long been unseen because MGM bought the film in order to do a 1940 remake (starring Vivien Leigh) and locked the original away in the vault.  Directed by James Whale the same year he didFrankenstein(1931), the picture charts the romance of a chorus-girl-turned-streetwalker (Mae Clarke) and a well-born young soldier (Kent Douglass) on brief furlough from the trenches during WWI.  Apart from a zesty prelude in a London music hall and two scenes on the titular bridge, the film remains yoked to its talky theatrical source, a Robert E. Sherwood play flogging the hoary conceit that no fallen woman, however pure of heart, could be permitted to marry into a good family.  Unlike the Hays Code-compliant remake, the film leaves no doubt how the heroine makes her living.--Richard T.

{"description": "Joyeux Noelcaptures a rare moment of grace from one of the worst wars in the history of mankind, World War I. On Christmas Eve, 1914, as German, French, and Scottish regiments face each other from their respective trenches, a musical call-and-response turns into an impromptu cease-fire, trading chocolates and champagne, playing soccer, and comparing pictures of their wives. But when Christmas ends, the war returns...Joyeux Noelhas been justly accused of sentimentality, but if any subject warrants such an earnest and hopeful treatment, it's the horrors of trench warfare.

{"description": "If Richard Donner's 1978 feature filmSuperman: The Moviemade us believe a man could fly, Bryan Singer's 2006 follow-up,Superman Returns, lets us remember that a superhero movie can make our spirits soar. Superman (played by newcomer Brandon Routh) comes back to Earth after a futile five-year search for his destroyed home planet of Krypton. As alter ego Clark Kent, he's eager to return to his job at the Daily Planet and to see Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth). Lois, however, has moved on: she now has a fianc&#xE9; (James Marsden), a son (Tristan Leabu), and a Pulitzer Prize for her article entitled \"Why the World Doesn't Need Superman.\" On top of this emotional curveball, his old archrival Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) is plotting the biggest land grab in history.Singer, who made a strong impression among comic-book fans for his work on the X-Men franchise and directed Spacey inThe Usual Suspects, brings both a fresh eye and a sense of respect to the world's oldest superhero. He borrows John Williams's great theme music and Marlon Brando's voice as Jor-El, and the story (penned by Singer'sX-Mencollaborators Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris) is a sort-of-sequel to the first two films in the franchise (choosing to ignore that the third and fourth movies ever happened). The humorous and romantic elements give the movie a heart, Singer's art-deco Metropolis is often breathtaking, and the special effects are elegant and spectacular, particularly an early airplane-disaster set-piece. Of the cast, Routh is excellent as the dual Superman/Clark, Spacey is both droll and vicious as Luthor, and Parker Posey gets the best lines as Luthor's moll Kitty. But at 23, Bosworth seems too young for the five-years-past-grizzled Lois. It's nice to see Noel Neill, Jack Larson (both from the classicAdventures of SupermanTV series), and Eva Marie-Saint on the screen as well. Superman Returns is one of those projects that was in development for seemingly forever, but it was worth the wait -- it's the most enjoyable superhero movie sinceSpider-Man 2andThe Incredibles.--David HoriuchiMore SupermanWatch our exclusive interviews with the cast ofSuperman ReturnsOther feature filmsSuperman in high definitionSmallvilleAdventures of SupermanSee all Superman DVDs", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001DJLD2G", "B000IJ79VQ", "B000IJ79X4", "B000IJ79XE", "B000IJ79WU", "B008JFUPFI", "B000IJ79UW", "B001CDR1FG", "B000ION23U", "B002GSXKN8", "B004EPZ07K", "B0000959N0", "B00005JNTU", "B004LWZWFQ", "B001DHXT20", "B000VI70QS", "B0006L0LOS", "B0007P0Y7C", "B000UR9T8C", "B00005JNJV", "B00005JMQW", "B00005JKCH", "B000AYELVU", "B004LWZW42", "B0090SI56Y", "B001OST0LW", "B001OST0M6", "B001QB9H1U", "B000HCO83Q", "B000PE0G0A", "B001GCUO1Q", "B0002IQMAM", "B004LWZWGA", "B008JFUS0U", "B000P0J06K", "B000OVLBF8", "B00E5I2MCM", "B003YAR97K", "B001GZ6QC4", "B00080ZG2O", "B003QO8TOQ", "B001FB55HQ", "B005LAIGW8", "B000I8OM94", "B000FO0AHY", "B00IZZDWKM", "B000P0J06U", "B0007V6ITE", "B008JFUO72", "B000AYELVA", "B002NXSRVG", "B00DYEN6XC", "B00E5I2MEK", "B000BT96EG", "B001HQZJMU", "B001QTXM5Y", "B00E5I2M6I", "B002HWRYJE", "B00E5I2M9K", "B001614E68", "B000059Z8L", "B001VLBDD0", "B000EU1Q3Q", "B000EU1Q2M", "B000KJU1KK", "B00BTYMPUY", "B000H30B2C", "B001F7MSFM", "B0013BM63O", "B00F4FFO8E", "B000EGDB10", "B00008G8M5", "B00JPS7HOA", "0790738953", "B000B7QCGS", "B000HWZ4E8", "B00BBXSPES", "B000FMGTTE", "B0083SBMBM", "B003Z8ZCDO", "B005LAII44", "B000P6XQ50", "B000VI28Z6", "B00AZMFJYA", "B001RHGRT8", "B000F4RH8E", "B002ZG99B8", "B001AK3S4Y", "B00005JL78", "B0002ZMHX6", "B0007G89FU", "B006VRRGNK", "B00BBAQD6S", "B009JBWOU0", "B000BT96FA", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B00BGI086Q", "B003UN2ICM", "B0000VCZMK"], "bought_together": ["B008JFUPFI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B008JFUPFI", "B00F4FFO8E", "B001DJLD2G", "B000IJ79UW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 57565}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.73, "brand": "DC Comics", "asin": "B000J10EQU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Ddmxk8VML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Superman Returns (Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "Need a good cry? A real fistful-of-Kleenex, cathartic, \"Oh (sob) my (sob) God (sob)\" weeping jag? The deft and lovelyMiracle in the Rainis exactly what the love doc ordered. The 1956 classic stars Jane Wyman as Ruth, that long-lost movie heroine type: a working-girl spinster caring for her ailing mother, toiling at her mundane job and feeling life's passing her by. Well, life has a little surprise up its sleeve, in the form of a random meeting on the streets of New York, with a soldier named Arthur (Van Johnson), who's on temporary leave during World War II. The streets are dingy and the rain is pounding, but the mood is changed; two lost souls connect. What follows is a believable, heart-wrenching tale with a great script (courtesy of Ben Hecht), and terrific performances by the two leads and a brassy Eileen Heckart as Ruth's best pal (and chaperone on the couple's first date!). The film presages the later weepySomewhere in Time, with its echoes of fate, chance, and even the role of a tiny coin. Fans of romance of all eras, who believe what Arthur says--\"Love never dies\"--should wrap themselves in the cocoon ofMiracle in the Rain--and never stop believing in miracles.--A.T.

{"description": "Martin Scorsese makes a welcome return to the mean streets (of Boston, in this case) withThe Departed, hailed by many as Scorsese's best film sinceCasino. Since this crackling crime thriller is essentially a Scorsese-stamped remake of the acclaimed 2002 Hong Kong thrillerInfernal Affairs, the film was intensely scrutinized by devoted critics and cinephiles, and while Scorsese's intense filmmaking and all-star cast deserve ample acclaim,The Departedis also worthy of serious re-assessment, especially with regard to what some attentive viewers described as sloppy craftsmanship (!), notably in terms of mismatched shots and jagged continuity. But no matter where you fall on the Scorsese appreciation scale, there's no denying thatThe Departedis a signature piece of work from one of America's finest directors, designed for maximum impact with a breathtaking series of twists, turns, and violent surprises. It's an intricate cat-and-mouse game, but this time the cat and mouse are both moles: Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) is an ambitious cop on the rise, planted in the Boston police force by criminal kingpin Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a hot-tempered police cadet who's been artificially disgraced and then planted into Costello's crime operation as a seemingly trustworthy soldier. As the multilayered plot unfolds (courtesy of a scorching adaptation byKingdom of Heavenscreenwriter William Monahan), Costigan and Sullivan conduct a volatile search for each other (they're essentially looking for \"themselves\") while simultaneously wooing the psychiatrist (Vera Farmiga) assigned to treat their crime-driven anxieties.Such convenient coincidences might sink a lesser film, butThe Departedis so electrifying that you barely notice the plot-holes. And while Nicholson's profane swagger is too much \"Jack\" and not enough \"Costello,\" he's still a joy to watch, especially in a film that's additionally energized by memorable (and frequently hilarious) supporting roles for Alec Baldwin, Mark Wahlberg, and a host of other big-name performers.The Departedalso makes clever and plot-dependent use of cell-phones, to the extent that it couldn't exist without them. Powered by Scorsese's trademark use of well-chosen soundtrack songs (from vintage rock to Puccini's operas),The Departedmay not be perfect, but it's one helluva ride for moviegoers, proving popular enough to become the biggest box-office hit of Scorsese's commercially rocky career.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002ZG99N6", "B000P0J09M", "B004SIP7TE", "B004SIP8ZM", "B002ZG980U", "B002VWNIEA", "B00011CZRE", "B00AEBB8NI", "B002T9H2LA", "B00005JLSB", "B000MZHW40", "B00080ZG10", "B003ASLJQS", "B000P0J0AG", "B000P0J0EW", "B000C20VPA", "B003UESJHO", "B004SIP7ZS", "B003ASLJO0", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B002CPMB9O", "B00AHTYI5M", "B00275EGWY", "B000XR9L50", "B000A3XY5A", "B0007DFJ0G", "B001N44BVQ", "B00003CXWV", "B008MILL8W", "B000286RP2", "B004SIP7VM", "B00005V9HH", "6305313687", "B00AEBB9NM", "B004FQX5B6", "B00AEFXKUI", "B004SIP95G", "B00AEBB86A", "B005LAIIJY", "B0016Q2D66", "B003ASLJQI", "B00008975Z", "B000IY04Q8", "B001P9KR8U", "B00005JNJV", "B000C20VRS", "B008R65XYC", "B005LAIGRS", "B00H9KKGTO", "B00008DP4C", "B00AEBB9F0", "B00AEFY5B6", "B00005JN0W", "B005LAIGLE", "B000A2UBN4", "B002QEHPQU", "B000P0J0EM", "B003UESJH4", "B007D5E7C2", "6304765258", "B000P0J0D8", "B00AEFY0XE", "B00004WG2F", "0767830555", "B000LC55F2", "B002O3Z4Y8", "B004EPYZP8", "B000A7DVR2", "B00005JPD0", "B000WZEZGI", "B00049QQHI", "B000FS9FCG", "B00004XPPB", "B006OFN0SE", "B009AMAL4Y", "B004U7MR14", "B000GFLKF8", "B003AWRMCE", "B0019L770A", "B00BEIYN9Q", "B0000AM6JI", "B004SIP9Z6", "B001GZ6QC4", "0783240295", "B0010DR4BO", "B000065U1N", "B00001ZWUS", "B00BB67UNW", "B0000B1OFL", "B00AEBB9K0", "B00DHDDE32", "B00005JKWX", "B0051MKNV8", "B002ZG97RE", "0767802519", "B0034G4P94", "B00DHHWXYY", "B00005B6JZ", "B00003CXZ4", "B001TODCII"], "bought_together": ["B000P0J09M"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000RETOHY", "B000P0J09M", "B000P0J0EW", "B00AEBB8NI"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 5067}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.5, "brand": "Warner Bros", "asin": "B000M341QE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RZnzpL34L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)"}
