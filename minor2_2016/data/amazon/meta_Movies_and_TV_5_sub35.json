{"description": "This television film based on the autobiographical novels of country veterinarian James Herriot predates the popular British TV series of the same name by several years. Shot on location in the picturesque Yorkshire countryside, it is utterly charming and features quite an illustrious cast. Academy Award-winning actor Sir Anthony Hopkins is terrific as the dedicated, exasperating Dr. Siegfried Farnon, who takes young Herriot, fresh out of a London veterinary college, on as his assistant.  Herriot is appealingly played by Simon Ward (perhaps best known as the Duke of Buckingham inThe Three Musketeers).  The movie opens as Herriot arrives for an interview with Farnon.  Dressed in his spotless Saville Row suit, Herriot is immediately swept along on a \"horse call\" and finds himself treating a messy injury.  This is the life that Herriot always dreamed of!  Like the series, the movie is a must for animal lovers.  (Yes, Mrs. Pumphrey is here with her pampered lap dog, Tricky Woo.)  It's also delightfully romantic, as it follows the courtship between Herriot and his bride-to-be, Helen (lovely Lisa Harrow).  Droll British humor and authentic period detail cap off a thoroughly satisfying production.--Laura Mirsky", "related": {"also_bought": ["0312330855", "B003DUBAXK", "0312206291"], "also_viewed": ["B003DUBAXK", "B003DUBAWQ", "0345434900"]}, "price": 36.97, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 340319}, "asin": "0764004719", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514Q4NA4AML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "All Creatures Great &amp; Small [VHS]"}

{"description": "Simon (James Urbaniak), a shy garbage man, lives with his sister (Parker Posey ofParty GirlandWaiting for Guffman, among dozens of other movies) and mother, who both treat him with minimal respect. Into Simon's life comes Henry Fool (Thomas Jay Ryan), a heavy-drinking self-proclaimed great writer who goads Simon into writing an enormous poem. The poem becomes the source of great controversy, proclaimed by some as a great work of art, denounced by others as perverse  trash. As Simon's star rises, he tries to draw attention to Henry's work as  well, to little avail. Though the premise seems simple,Henry Fooltakes  on something of an epic sweep as it follows the effects of fame on Simon's and Henry's lives. This rumination on art and inspiration was hailed by some critics as the best film yet by writer-director Hal Hartley (Trust,Simple Men,Amateur), while others felt it brought out his worst self-indulgences. All of Hartley's movies defy easy interpretation, andHenry Foolis no exception. Still, it's a rare film that even tries to tackle such subjects, let alone does so with a combination of intelligence and humor (ranging from verbal quirkiness to scatological embarrassment). Hartley's films, surprisingly enough, feel warmer and more accessible on video; perhaps watching them in one's home makes them seem more intimate and less abstract.--Bret Fetzer", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 515576}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.88, "brand": "", "asin": "0767811437", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5121PKS6T6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Henry Fool [VHS]"}
{"description": "For all of its conventional plotting about an obsessive-compulsive curmudgeon (Jack Nicholson) who improves his personality at the urging of his gay neighbor (Greg Kinnear) and a waitress (Helen Hunt) who inspires his best behavior, this is one of the sharpest Hollywood comedies of the 1990s. Nicholson could play his role in his sleep (the Oscar he won should have gone to Robert Duvall forThe Apostle), but his mischievous persona is precisely necessary to give heart to his seemingly heartless character, who is of all things a successful romance novelist. As a single mom with a chronically asthmatic young son, Hunt gives the film its conscience and integrity (along with plenty of wry humor), and she also won an Oscar for her wonderful performance. Greg Kinnear had to settle for an Oscar nomination (while cowriter-director James L. Brooks was inexplicably snubbed by Oscar that year), but his work was also singled out in the film's near-unanimous chorus of critical praise. It's questionable whether a romance between Hunt and the much older Nicholson is entirely believable, but this movie's smart enough--and charmingly funny enough--to make it seem endearingly possible.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0001AVZA8", "B000YAF4MA", "0800141741", "B004FQX5B6", "B0000YEEGM", "B0038N9WKU", "B000FVQLQQ", "B00AEBB9WI", "B00005JLSK", "0783226845", "B0000AOV4I", "B000YDBPAM", "B000XJD33O", "B004SIP7ZS", "B00081U7HC", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00AEBB8YW", "B00003CXFV", "B001ECDVK4", "6305212112", "B000EHRVOW", "B00009Y3PV", "6304765266", "B00004RJ73", "B005F2JRUC", "0783225733", "B00AEFXYOA", "6305236569", "B000OCZA04", "B000FFJYBG", "B003ASLJK4", "0792833198", "B000JYW5B4", "B00012QLB4", "B00BTYRB3U", "B0043X1FL8", "B000055Y0Y", "B00005B6JZ", "B000EHQU0S", "B00AEBB9UK", "B00008G7UF", "B0002B15ZG", "B00005JG6N", "B001MBTTNA", "B001ECDVJU", "B00003CWQR", "B00AEFY4CG", "630471193X", "B002GHHHP6", "B00AEBB9NM", "B0000A02TZ", "0767821769", "B00569I5BQ", "B00AEFYSWM", "B00AEFXYJA", "B000XT1P3E", "B002GHHHGU", "B00026ZG10", "6305128952", "B00005OLYF", "B001LMAK9W", "B000N6U0E2", "B000EMGJ7C", "B000023VTP", "B00CPTUOI2", "B004SIP9U6", "B00001ZWUS", "B003BV8ICC", "B0043X1FM2", "B0013XZ2QK", "B00AEFXT1S", "B00AEBB9FA", "B007SPPANM", "B00005JM4Q", "B007N31YH0", "B000VECAD0", "B00003CXO1", "B00009WVSL", "B00003CXSM", "B000NA1WDQ", "B00004BZIY", "B002AS464Q", "B000J103OI", "B000021Y7L", "B000ENC5YW", "B0002V7ON8", "B00009W5CA", "B00015YVDG", "B0009X75O2", "B0000JBALO", "0767803434", "6305065551", "B000MQC9H4", "6305692572", "B00013RC2U", "6305144168", "B00008979G", "B000CCBCAS", "0792846443", "B000M341QE"], "bought_together": ["B0001AVZA8", "B000YAF4MA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0001AVZA8", "B0038N9WKU", "B000YAF4MA", "B00013WWT8"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 5469}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.96, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "0767811100", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51KRRMHSAJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "As Good As It Gets"}

{"description": "This attempt to reunite the stars ofWhite Men Can't Jumpwill most likely be remembered as the movie that allegedly inspired a number of copycat arsons in the New York subway system. In other words, the movie itself is too perfunctory to be remembered for any other reason. Woody Harrelson and Wesley Snipes share their established chemistry as a pair of stepbrothers who work the subway detail as undercover detectives in the NYPD. Woody's a compulsive gambler with a huge debt problem to contend with, and he's also competing with his brother for the attentions of their new and beautiful partner (Jennifer Lopez), who's been assigned to join their investigation of the subway crimes. They're also supposed to guard the daily money train (so named because it contains each day's worth of subway fares), but Woody gets the bright idea that it might be the solution to his money woes. What follows is standard-issue action fare for the mid-1990s--lots of violence, excessive profanity, and attempts at witty banter between the costars to make it all seem more entertaining than it really is. You'd need to be a serious Harrelson, Snipes, or Lopez fan to add this movie to your collection.

{"description": "Minnie Driver stars as an impoverished Jewish woman, Mary,  living in an emphatically anti-Semitic England in the mid-19th century. Following  the murder of her beloved father--who leaves his survivors strapped with  his debts--she camouflages her identity as a Protestant of Italian descent  and takes a job as governess to an unorthodox Scottish family. In this film  by Sandra Goldbacher, sundry conventions from Victorian novels mix with a contemporary, feminist take on Mary's subsequent adventures. Mary  asserts, with some effort, her authority over her willful charge (Florence  Hoath); she dodges the insults of a vaguely ghoulish matriarch (Harriet Walter);  and she becomes an aide, confidante, and lover to the man of the house (Tom Wilkinson), a naturalist dabbling with early experiments in  photography. Goldbacher fails to make it all feel as fully realized as it could be  (much of the detail and soul of Mary's life in London is too telescoped and impressionistic to sink in). But the film's middle section, in which  the heroine's complicity with Wilkinson's married character engages her  keen intelligence as well as her untapped sensuality, is deeply felt. It's  nice to see Driver prove she can carry a film, though the dreamy, exotic photography by Ashley Rowe certainly pulls a viewer along as well.--Tom Keogh", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 425881}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.79, "brand": "", "asin": "0767811429", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518E0FZ868L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Governess [VHS]"}
{"description": "Penny Marshall's popular 1992 comedy sheds light on a little-known chapter of American sports history with its story of a struggling team in the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. The league was formed when the recruiting of soldiers during World War II resulted in a shortage of men's baseball teams. The AAGPBL continued after the war (until 1954), and Marshall's movie depicts the league in full swing, beginning when a savvy baseball scout (Jon Lovitz) finds a pair of promising new players in small-town Oregonian sisters (Geena Davis, Lori Petty). The sisters are signed to play for the Rockford Peaches near Chicago, whose new manager (Tom Hanks) is a former home-run king who wrecked his career with alcoholism. They're all a bunch of underdogs, and Marshall (with a witty script by Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel) does a fine job of establishing a colorful team of supporting players including Madonna and (in her movie debut) Rosie O'Donnell. It's a conventional Hollywood sports story (Marshall's never been one to take dramatic risks), but the stellar cast is delightful, and the movie's filled with memorable moments, witty dialogue, and agreeable sentiment. And just remember: there's no crying in baseball!--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783235968", "630141277X", "6302534372", "0767809262", "6303506291", "B00005M20M", "0792151712"], "also_viewed": ["B000003KMM", "B0012GMZZY", "630596260X", "0783235968", "B00B4804KS"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 393057}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.17, "brand": "", "asin": "076780922X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51A158TD4RL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "A League of Their Own [VHS]"}
{"description": "Robert Crumb is known for his disturbing, yet compelling, underground cartoons: his most famous works made countercultural icons out of Mr. Natural (\"Keep on Truckin'...\") and Fritz the Cat. Terry Zwigoff delves into the odd world of the cartoonist in his documentary filmCrumb, and the picture that emerges is not always pretty--at moments, it's almost repellent--but it's a fascinating glimpse into a very strange mind. Interviewing immediate family--Crumb has one suicidal brother, one semi-psychopathic brother, two sisters who declined to be interviewed, and a tyrannical mother--Crumb begins to look a bit saner. Given his surroundings, it's remarkable that he has survived so well. His hostilities toward women may turn some viewers off, but his wife, Aline, seems to be a grounding point, and she provides a solid counterbalance to the man.  No one shies away from discussing incredibly intimate things (namely, sex!), which explains much of R. Crumb's cartoons.

Petersen manages a viselike grip on the tension and Eastwood even gets to deliver an ever-more-timely lecture on the diminished nature of the office of President. Eastwood's as gruff and as infuriating to the by-the-book Powers That Be as ever, and Malkovich oozes delightful menace.

{"description": "The Bad Sleep Welltells the story of corruption at the highest levels of Japanese business and its tragic consequences. Though flawed by a tedious introductory sequence and by an ending that seems out of sync with the story, it is a fascinating movie and the middle part is especially exciting.Japanese legend Toshiro Mifune plays Koichi Nishi, the seemingly stoic bridegroom who is trying to get ahead by marrying the boss's daughter, Kieko (Kyoko Kagawa), who was crippled as a girl. The bride's brother, in a shocking display, exposes the groom's motives during his wedding toast and threatens his new brother-in-law with death if he disappoints his sister. But Nishi is not who we think. He was born the illegitimate son of the man who Kieko's father, Iwabuchi (Maysayuki Mori), manipulated into suicide. Now Nishi wants revenge for his father's death. As Nishi slowly destroys Iwabuchi's life, he makes the fatal error of falling in love with his wife, who already loves him. Their unconsummated marriage stands between these two like a palpable pillar of stone. But just when we think the stone has been tossed aside by love, Iwabuchi finds out who his son-in-law really is.Shot in black and white, this film falls just short of being brilliant. Mifune is amazing in his portrayal of this complex man who lets his father's past destroy his own future, and Maysayuki Mori's performance as the evil Iwabuchi is understated but nonetheless chilling.--Luanne Brown", "price": 39.88, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 549816}, "asin": "0780020820", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51WN299DV2L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Bad Sleep Well [VHS]"}
{"description": "By the time he madeGood Morningin 1959, Yasujiro Ozu  had completely eliminated camera movement from his uniquely simple but  elegant directorial style. He chose instead to emphasize static but  meticulously purposeful compositions that rarely, if ever, wavered from  their recognizable low-angle perspective. InGood Morning, this  observational approach is put to sublime use to establish setting (a late-'50s Tokyo suburb) and to view the world through the eyes of the  film's central characters&#x97;-two young brothers who take a mutual vow of  silence to protest their parents' refusal to buy a TV set. Their father claims that television will create \"a million idiots,\" while their  mother is angered by the boys' neglect of schoolwork in favor of  watching sumo wrestling on a neighbor's TV.In Ozu's hands, this sublimely simple conflict inspires a comedic exploration of Japan at the dawn of its electronic age, when  consumerism and materialism are in vogue, salesmen solicit their wares  in constant door-to-door visits, and even the purchase of a washing  machine can prompt neighbors into a frenzy of gossipy speculation.  Funniest of all are the conspiratorial brothers, who play an amusing  variation of \"pull my finger\" (proving that even great directors can  indulge a fart joke if they choose), and employ their silent strategy  with the stubbornness that only children can get away with. Through it  all, Ozu develops a handful of intermingling themes of love,  communication, goodwill, and the changing of societal traditions.  Utterly simple on the surface,Good Morningreveals its  complexity in careful proportion, with the affectionate humanity that  was Ozu's greatest gift.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001BEK8CE", "B000OPPAF6", "B003ICZW7S", "B0001GH5RY", "B00026L7MC", "B00EO2I6W4", "B00005JLV7", "B0012Z3630", "B000EOTWIS", "B00HVOFP6W", "B00007CVS2", "B00HVOFP9O", "B000BB14I0", "B000KRNGNQ", "B00GPPXNEE", "0780023099", "B000067IY6", "B00A8QDHYW", "7885729117", "B00CEIOH8C", "B00GA9F2PI", "B000I8OOG0", "B00129CFMY", "B00IGK6T9W", "B00004W3HF", "B001LMU1C8", "B00B2BYXSQ", "B000093NR0", "B000F7CEC0", "B00007CVS3", "B0000A02TW", "B000BR6QCI", "B00DZP1BUU", "B00AQ6J536", "B00IGK6TGU", "B006X96PBU", "B00GPPXP6A", "B0000633SD", "B00152VXU8", "B004OOL73W", "B0001UZZSG", "B00000CQJZ", "B00F98FOFY", "B000BC8SWE", "B00180R072", "B000AQKUG8", "B0019X400S", "B00IGK6TLA", "B00092ZLG2", "B004M66YUS", "B00004Z1FM", "B00JGR3M26", "B00GPPXNLC", "6305744114", "B00CUKTHJ8", "B00005UQ7Q", "B00I3C1T1Q", "B00005QAPJ", "B001BEK8BK", "B00J2R3W1G", "B004ALIG4M", "1559409053", "B000K0YLZ0", "B00005JKGX", "B00005BCK0", "B00J5LXMTG", "B00GBT629C", "B00GBT63IC", "B001LMU19G", "B000NOK0GW", "B0007939R0", "B0035ECI12", "B004VH657U", "B004ALIG1U", "B0000A02TX", "B00005B1ZK", "B00DHN8GQ2", "B000E5LEVA", "B000093NQZ", "B000PKG6OY", "B000E5LEV0", "B00092ZLEY", "B00CUKTHHK", "0780022343", "B001BEK8BU", "B000K0YLX2", "B004WPYO4C", "B000E1YVZ0", "B000BMY2NS", "6305257450", "B00004W229", "B004CGUBZW", "B00005BHW6", "B00GG0NABE", "B00004XQMY", "B00JAQJNN0", "B00009MEA0", "B000GTJSE4", "B008Y5OWO8"], "bought_together": ["B001BEK8CE", "B000OPPAF6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000OPPAF6", "B001BEK8CE", "B00EO2I6W4", "B000EOTWIS"]}, "price": 21.9, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 62659}, "asin": "0780023307", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41EBVQ3D9SL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Good Morning (The Criterion Collection)"}
{"description": "The plotline may sound familiar: Two mismatched cops are assigned as reluctant partners to solve a crime. Culturally they are complete opposites, and they quickly realize they can't stand each other. One (Jackie Chan) believes in doing things by the book. He is a man with integrity and nerves of steel. The other (Chris Tucker) is an amiable rebel who can't stand authority figures. He's a man who has to do everything on his own, much to the displeasure of his superior officer, who in turn thinks this cop is a loose cannon but tolerates him because he gets the job done. Directed by Brett Ratner,Rush Hourdoesn't break any new ground in terms of story, stunts, or direction. It rehashes just about every \"buddy\" movie ever made--in fact, it makes films such asTango and Cashseem utterly original and clever by comparison. So, why did this uninspired movie make over $120 million at the box office? Was the whole world suffering from temporary insanity? Hardly. The explanation for the success ofRush Houris quite simple: chemistry. The casting of veteran action maestro Jackie Chan with the charming and often hilarious Chris Tucker was a serendipitous stroke of genius. Fans of Jackie Chan may be slightly disappointed by the lack of action set pieces that emphasize his kung-fu craft. On the other hand, those who know the history of this seasoned Hong Kong actor will be able to appreciate thatRush Hourwas the mainstream breakthrough that Chan had deserved for years. Coupled with the charismatic scene-stealer Tucker, Chan gets to flex his comic muscles to great effect. From their first scenes together to the trademark Chan outtakes during the end credits, their ability to play off of one another is a joy to behold, and this mischievous interaction is what saves the film from slipping into the depths of pitiful mediocrity.--Jeremy Storey", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00003CY5X", "B000059XYJ", "B00005JL8Y", "6302091632", "B00006G8LB", "B00000JGEK", "6300213730"], "bought_together": ["B00003CY5X"], "also_viewed": ["B00003CY5X", "B00005JL8Y", "B000WGYMTC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 400219}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.0, "brand": "", "asin": "0780623711", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514DYRWFBKL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Rush Hour [VHS]"}
{"description": "Repeated viewings can't dispel the shock of the final scene in this classic 1941 romantic mystery--a brief but disorienting confrontation that suddenly inverts the heroine's mounting conviction that she's married a murderer, forcing us to reconsider virtually every scene and line of dialogue that's preceded it. It's a masterful coup de grace for director Alfred Hitchcock, who has built a puzzle around the corrosive power of suspicion, threaded with deft ambiguities that toy with dramatic conventions and character archetypes in nearly every frame.As embodied by Joan Fontaine, who nabbed an Oscar in this second outing with the director, Lina McLaidlaw is a buttoned-up, bookish heiress whose prim exterior conceals longings for a more engaged emotional life. Her solution materializes in the darkly handsome Johnnie Aysgarth, a gambler, womanizer, and spendthrift who flirts, then pursues, and soon marries her. As Aysgarth, Cary Grant is both irresistible and sinister, capable of deceit and petty theft, as well as grander designs on his bride's impending fortune. Lina's passion for Johnnie is clouded by each new revelation about his apparent dishonesty, from clandestine gambling to real estate development schemes; more troubling are clues implicating him in the death of his best friend, and the prospect that Johnnie may be slowly poisoning Lina herself. By the time we see him ascending a darkened staircase with a suspicious glass of milk, an image made all the more indelible through the spectral glow the director captures in the glass, the evidence seems damning indeed.In fact, even as Hitchcock stacks the deck against Johnnie, and takes full advantage of Grant's skill at conveying such menace, the director also dots his landscape with visual clues to Lina's own neurotic (and erotic) obsessions. The final scene forces us to reevaluate her behavior while leaving enough of a cloud over Johnnie to rob him, and us, of a complete exoneration. It's a wicked, unsettling payoff to a brilliantly executed thriller.--Sam Sutherland", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300183513", "B00000F3UB", "0790743213", "6304039530", "0782006779", "630266232X", "B0000040EO", "6302413435", "0783222955", "6303120504", "080013222X"], "also_viewed": ["B00AEBB97S", "B000UVV25Q", "B000CCW2TS", "B001D8W7EK", "B001D8W7F4", "B008D1Q1VU", "B007N5YJWK", "B0002HOERG", "B000A9QK7I", "B004H83IFU", "B004UOHNAC", "B00DNQA16G", "B008D1R52E", "B007FQXEVY", "B007FQXEQO", "B001KXZGOG", "B006H37P2K", "B00DNQM7N6"]}, "price": 4.39, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 447983}, "asin": "0780626702", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41YM01J4SGL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Suspicion [VHS]"}

{"description": "Before Hollywood had entirely typecast Alfred Hitchcock as the master of suspense, withMr. & Mrs. Smithhe was allowed to fashion an elegant romantic trifle starring Robert Montgomery and Carole Lombard. It probably won't replaceRear WindoworPsychoin your affections, but the film is more than a curious footnote to the director's career. The two leads play David and Ann Smith, a devoted but endlessly squabbling couple who discover their three-year marriage isn't legal. When he unexpectedly hesitates to arrange a second wedding, she storms out in a huff and soon begins dating his solid, dependable business partner Jeff (Gene Raymond). The rest follows the formula laid down by such previous screwball comedies asThe Awful Truth(1937) andBringing Up Baby(1938): David employs fair means or foul to win back Ann's heart, causes all sorts of complicated mischief, then... well, three guesses what happens in the end.The intriguing thing about the movie is how Hitchcock takes Norman Krasna's paper-thin script and adds sly undercurrents of menace. Violence seems about to erupt in the recurring scenes where Ann shaves her husband (suggestively holding a razor up to his throat)--and there's a touch ofVertigoin one scary moment when a jammed amusement park ride leaves two characters dangling helplessly high above the ground. Montgomery and Lombard keep the mood acceptably frivolous, while indicating the flawed nature of the marital relationship. From the evidence of this one-off, Hitchcock might have been among the best comedy directors in the business, had he so wished.--Peter Matthews", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 506512}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.5, "brand": "", "asin": "0780626699", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51WQC2AJP4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Mr &amp; Mrs Smith [VHS]"}

{"description": "First broadcast on HBO in June of 1998--shortly before the theatrical release of Steven Spielberg'sSaving Private Ryan--this World War II drama offers an equally intimate and devastating study of combat and its tragic aftermath. Set in Germany during the closing days of the war, the film uses a little-known episode of U.S. military history--the bloody battle of the Hurtigen Forest--as the backdrop for the story of a battle-weary private (Ron Eldard) who is the only surviving member of his platoon. Despite his request for dismissal on the grounds of mental disability and shell-shock, he is considered a promising soldier by his superiors, promoted to sergeant, and assigned to command a fresh platoon of young, inexperienced soldiers. The cycle of war continues, and the film ends as it began--with one soldier carrying a mortally wounded comrade from a scene of devastating loss. A veteran of several war films, director John Irvin emphasizes the gritty, physically exhausting realities of combat with keen attention to detail on location in Hungary. This film is decidedly downbeat (don't look for any Spielbergian uplift here), but its depiction of warfare is undeniably powerful, earning praise for Irvin and HBO for tackling such an uncompromising project.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["1564080242", "6302224330"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 446559}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 14.95, "brand": "", "asin": "0783112750", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51N4DD2MXAL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "When Trumpets Fade [VHS]"}

An ambitious, epic, utterly mind-boggling--and, let's admit it, all-out weird--adaptation of Frank Herbert's classic science fiction novel,Duneremains one of the most controversial films in the director's exceedingly provocative career. The story (ifDunecan be said to have just one story) is complex and convoluted in the epic tradition; it has something to do with political intrigue and a planet that is home to a precious spice and gigantic sand worms. Think Shakespeare'sHenry IVwith a dash ofTremors, and set in another galaxy. But despite plenty of strangely whispered voice-overs that explain the characters' thoughts (and endlessly detailed exposition), storytelling is not really among the film's strong points. There are, however, a lot of memorably fantastic/grotesque images, an extraordinary cast, and a soundtrack featuring Toto. I told you it was weird.

Recovering with the aid of a local dwarf (a memorable role for Billy Curtis), the Stranger is hired by the intimidated townsfolk to fend off a band of violent ex-convicts. After teaching the citizens self-defense and instructing them to paint the entire town red and rename it &quot;Hell,&quot; the Stranger vanishes. He reappears when the marauding criminals arrive, and delivers justice and teaches the townsfolk a harsh lesson about moral obligation. Is he a figure from their past or a kind of supernatural avenger?

It's the movie that macho maverick writer-director John Milius was born to make, and Arnold was genetically engineered for his role as the muscle-bound, angst-ridden hero created in Robert E. Howard's pulp novels. Oliver Stone contributed to Milius's screenplay, and the production design by comic artist Ron Cobb represents a perfect cinematic realization of Howard's fantasy world. To avenge the murder of his parents, Conan tracks down the evil Thulsa Doom (James Earl Jones) with the help of Queen Valeria (played by buff B-movie vixen Sandahl Bergman) and Subotai the Mongol (Gerry Lopez).

{"description": "If you're a lifetime member of the Jennifer Connelly fan club, you'll be in the passionate minority of people (100% male) who won't care that this 1991 comedy is wallowing in its own oily puddle of lameness. The gorgeous Ms. Connelly is conspicuously put on display in this typically lightweight fluff from writer-producer John Hughes. Frank Whaley does his best to liven up the male-fantasy plot about a semi-nerdy teen who gets a night-watchman job in a variety store, only to find himself locked in overnight with the local knockout (Connelly), who's as rich as she is beautiful. She's also really unhappy with her home life and her bully boyfriend (Dermot Mulroney), so it's Frank's big opportunity to make his move as a sympathetic Romeo. Shallow and contrived, the movie does have its standard moments of John Hughes delicacy, and a cameo by the late John Candy scores bonus points for comedy. Still, it's clear that the movie exists primarily to satisfy adolescent lust--and with Connelly as the object of desire, this otherwise tiresome comedy is a triumph of wish-fulfillment casting.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004XVMCNK", "B0010AN7YA", "B00E8G5GU6", "0792845803", "B00CPTUO1Y", "B00007ELES", "B0002V7O5Q", "B005XB8T68", "B003JNIB74", "B0001IN0S0", "6305428514", "B003NEQ74S", "B00013WWT8", "B00009OWJY", "B0087MN9QU", "B0012RWQJ8", "B0001DMVBC", "B000065V3H", "B00005R5G9", "B005QX8UEE", "B00J4LMHMK", "B003JJGBXY", "B00005JMIJ", "B00005JM8W", "B0057FGCWS", "B002I41KNC", "B002DQSKMY", "B00049QJBG", "B000PMFRYC", "B0000714E7", "B004SUDQC2", "B00DVD5SBE", "B0000542CA", "B0000C3I96", "B00005U5AG", "B005JZBP4Q", "B00AG475K8", "B002JOUNE8", "B0062MDNEK", "B00AEBB9DW", "B000068TPB", "B001Q8MMD8", "B007JLBVME", "0783226993", "B001AEF6C2", "B002XUBDRY", "B0003JAONG", "B001Q8MMBK", "B003GSLVX8", "B001AIQ14A", "B00IJE1CTM", "B001Q8MMCE", "B00EVIOWUG", "B0000A98ZO", "0790729334", "0783226926", "B00000JSJC", "B0053TWVA0", "B00008DDXK", "B00008O38H", "B000B5XOWU", "B00DMUFYZQ", "B00005Q4CS", "B00EMAGKNU", "B00005UW7U", "B006A8XGVQ", "B00441GZ28", "B000ERVJNG", "B00AEBB9M8", "B000FEBWTE", "B00GMV8LIO", "B00005JKI5", "B009R68HFI", "B00FKPJ3VM", "B002HGRI8W", "B000FJGWBC", "B003156II4", "B003M05KU0", "B0029XFN9Y", "B000AWYOGE", "B000053VB5", "B0000DD76S", "B005XB8SGO", "B000PMFS00", "B00004Y6C2", "B00AMEZDN8", "B0045HCJGW", "B00005QJIG", "B00DW5IL92", "6305922675", "B006M3M5FM", "6305428050", "B00003CXND", "B004YMATCY", "B003NZ30SI", "0783225482", "B0030BOCL4", "B00E1HIXFW", "B000E6ESTE", "B00005JH9M"], "bought_together": ["B004XVMCNK", "B00E8G5GU6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00319ECII", "0792845803", "B00CPTUO1Y", "B00E8G5GU6"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 55763}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.25, "brand": "WHALEY,FRANK", "asin": "0783229151", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51PHR82ETWL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Career Opportunities"}

{"description": "Sydney Pollack's approach to audio commentary for DVD editions of his  films is different from that of most other directors. Instead of detailing each scene ofOut of Africa, for example, Pollack  paints in broad strokes, talking about cinematic themes and in particular the translation of Karen Blixen's life in Africa from book to film. The fan of flubs and trivia won't find Pollack making any cute remarks, but he's  certainly interesting for the run of the film, describing the location shooting in Africa and how he dealt with Robert  Redford's casting and lack of accent. The new 45-minute documentaryA Song of Africahas old and new interviews with Pollack and Meryl Streep, who clearly should have shared the film's commentary duties; she's insightful and quite fun to listen to.

{"description": "Alfred Hitchcock considered this 1943 thriller to be his personal favorite among his own films, and although it's not as popular as some of Hitchcock's later work, it's certainly worthy of the master's admiration. Scripted by playwright Thornton Wilder and inspired by the actual case of a 1920's serial killer known as \"The Merry Widow Murderer,\" the movie sets a tone of menace and fear by introducing a psychotic killer into the small-town comforts of Santa Rosa, California. That's where young Charlie (Teresa Wright) lives with her parents and two younger siblings, and where murder is little more than a topic of morbid conversation for their mystery-buff neighbor (Hume Cronyn). Charlie was named after her favorite uncle, who has just arrived for an extended visit, and at first Uncle Charlie (Joseph Cotten) gets along famously with his admiring niece. But the film's chilling prologue has already revealed Uncle Charlie's true identity as the notorious Merry Widow Murderer, and the suspense grows almost unbearable when young Charlie's trust gives way to gradual dread and suspicion. Through narrow escapes and a climactic scene aboard a speeding train, this witty thriller strips away the fa&ccedil;ade of small-town tranquility to reveal evil where it's least expected. And, of course, it's all done in pure Hitchcockian style.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300183580", "6304039530", "1558807780", "6301670140", "0783221347", "0783235593", "6301798503", "0783235623", "6304039506", "6301975987", "630197350X", "6304429274", "6304359705", "6304457316", "6304119046", "6300183513", "6301798732", "6300215644", "6302909023", "B0000040EO", "630150528X", "0783222955", "6305123616", "0783217390", "0783235607", "6302278929", "6301797957", "6301798260", "B003MG6FJY", "0783235674", "6300158438", "6300215741", "6301564456", "0783235704", "6301327845", "6301586042", "6301800974", "B000003KE0", "0790733897", "6303020089", "0782008348", "6301977149", "6301969316", "6300183912", "6303364772", "6303957013", "1558804226", "6301973410", "B00004TX24", "6300988791", "630266232X", "6301973259", "6301670159", "0800100832", "0790743213", "6301640667", "6301969049", "B00004TYS8", "630196912X", "6302878535", "6302120101", "6300269264", "B00007JME0", "6302299497", "6302360978", "6300181421", "630160086X", "6302484421", "6302413435", "6300181340", "6302779782", "6302305942", "B0002IXSVI", "6301586026", "B00003OSTO", "0783235615", "6301964012", "079284517X", "0792837096", "B00000FZXC", "6302226899", "0783235682", "6300208133", "6301972171", "6302884705", "6302503493", "6302801133", "6303039693", "6304308418", "630196571X", "6301967682", "1558808590", "6303560067", "6305012792", "6300181723", "B000GX7MMA", "6303333079", "6301955625", "6301977815"], "bought_together": ["6300183580", "6301670140"], "also_viewed": ["6300183580", "6301670140"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 168467}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.5, "brand": "", "asin": "0783236352", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51K145Q7XJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Shadow of a Doubt [VHS]"}
{"description": "Robert Cummings stars as Barry Kane, a patriotic munitions worker who is falsely accused of sabotage, in this wartime thriller from Alfred Hitchcock.

But the most interesting thing aboutSaboteuris the frequency with which characters demonstrate their willingness to obstruct the police, going on nothing more than the fact that Kane seems like a stand-up guy. They do, again and again, apparently just because good people can spot other good people.Saboteurwas made during the thick of World War II, so there are a few passages of heavy-handed jingoism to get through but they're relatively painless. The script as a whole is a clever one--Algonquin wit Dorothy Parker shares a screenwriting credit, and her trademark zingers make for a terrific mix of humor and suspense.Saboteuris a pleasure whether you're a die-hard Hitchcock fan or just someone who likes a good nail-biter.--Ali Davis", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300183580", "0783235682"], "also_viewed": ["B001D8W7EA", "B000A1INJE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 450820}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.45, "brand": "", "asin": "0783236344", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5110R9HJEJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Saboteur [VHS]"}

{"description": "Robin Williams won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor, and actors Matt Damon and Ben Affleck nabbed one for Best Original Screenplay, but the feel-good hitGood Will Huntingtriumphs because of its gifted director, Gus Van Sant. The unconventional director (My Own Private Idaho,Drugstore Cowboy) saves a script marred by vanity and clunky character development by yanking soulful, touching performances out of his entire cast (amazingly, even one by Williams that's relatively schtick-free). Van Sant pulls off the equivalent of what George Cukor accomplished for women's melodrama in the '30s and '40s: He's crafted an intelligent, unabashedly emotional male weepie about men trying to find inner-wisdom.Matt Damon stars as Will Hunting, a closet math genius who ignores his gift in favor of nightly boozing and fighting with South Boston buddies (co-writer Ben Affleck among them). While working as a university janitor, he solves an impossible calculus problem scribbled on a hallway blackboard and reluctantly becomes the prodigy of an arrogant MIT professor (Stellan Skarsg&#229;rd). Damon only avoids prison by agreeing to see psychiatrists, all of whom he mocks or psychologically destroys until he meets his match in the professor's former childhood friend, played by Williams. Both doctor and patient are haunted by the past, and as mutual respect develops, the healing process begins. The film's beauty lies not with grand climaxes, but with small, quiet moments. Scenes such as Affleck's clumsy pep talk to Damon while they drink beer after work, or any number of therapy session between Williams and Damon offer poignant looks at the awkward ways men show affection and feeling for one another.--Dave McCoy", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000FVQLQQ", "B000P0J0EW", "6305144168", "B0043X1FL8", "B00000IQV7", "B00AEFY0F2", "B0000YEEGM", "B00JPQ1INI", "B004FQX5B6", "0800141741", "B00011CZRE", "B00AEFXESQ", "B00562D3Y2", "B00125WAWS", "0783226845", "B003ASLJQS", "B00005JLRZ", "B000M341QE", "B0034G4P7G", "B002ZG99N6", "B000N4RAR4", "0767811100", "6305428352", "B000P0J0EM", "B00009W5CA", "B002NZK5UK", "B003ASLJO0", "B00003CWQR", "B004SIP7VM", "B000B8QG22", "B00005V9HH", "B001F34HRS", "B004AOECXI", "B000N6U0E2", "B00AEFXYJA", "079284646X", "B0043X1FM2", "B00AEFY17E", "B000066HAS", "B000PHVZNE", "B003AWRMC4", "B00000G3PA", "B00AEBB9F0", "B00005JKWX", "B000MZHW40", "B000Z8GZYW", "B0018CWW5K", "B000P0J0C4", "B000P0J09M", "B00004BZIY", "B00B0U2SFE", "B003AWRMCE", "B00001ZWUS", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00005B6JZ", "B00005JLSB", "B0002ZDVEU", "6305428271", "B000FKO5QK", "B00AEBB9SM", "B00007GZR5", "B001SN78JO", "B000QQLVPQ", "630587493X", "B0001ADAVK", "B004WCTLNY", "0792843592", "B00AEBBA36", "B000FVQLRA", "B00AEFXXMI", "B000XJD33O", "B0002WZTOI", "B00004XPPG", "B00008G8M4", "B00AEBB9LO", "B000056VP4", "B006VRRGNK", "6305313687", "B0006FYOTC", "B001QERPAC", "B002O3Z4WK", "B001680M26", "B00AEFY4CG", "B000YDBPAM", "B0068FZ0GK", "0767836359", "B00005JN2Z", "B000765IJK", "B00008NFR4", "630471193X", "B002NZK5VO", "B000EGDB10", "B000068MBX", "B00000J122", "B00AMSLDTM", "B000MNOX94", "B000R4SMCW", "B00009AOBI", "B000XR9L50", "B00005JOC9"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000P0J0EW", "B000M341QE", "0783226845", "B002ZG99N6"]}, "price": 8.67, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 107799}, "asin": "0788814664", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51EQNMPT51L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Good Will Hunting"}

{"description": "Steven Spielberg, proving he's one of the few modern filmmakers who has the visual fluency to be capable of making a great silent film, took a melodramatic, D.W. Griffith-inspired approach to filming Alice Walker's novel. His tactics made the film controversial, but also a popular hit. You can argue with the appropriateness of Spielberg's decision, but his astonishing facility with images is undeniable--from the exhilarating and eye-popping opening shots of children playing in paradisiacal purple fields to the way he conveys the brutality of a rape by showing hanging leather belts banging against the head of the shaking bed. In a way it's a shame that Whoopi Goldberg, a stage monologist who made her screen debut in this movie, went on to become so famous, because it was, in part, her unfamiliarity that made her understated performance as Celie so effective. (This may be the first and last time that the adjectiveunderstatedcan be applied to Goldberg.) Nominated for 11 Academy Awards, including best picture and actress (supporting players Oprah Winfrey and Margaret Avery were also nominated), it was quite a scandal--and a crushing blow to Spielberg--when it won none.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000Y11B8K", "6305428409", "B000BOH8X2", "0788815474", "B002VWNIBI", "B00AEFYG3S", "B00007L4KF", "B003BV8I3Q", "0156028352", "B00005AQML", "B002CA68NO", "B00066FAVW", "B00465I1CE", "6305212112", "B00066FAQW", "B004FK5EDY", "B003HKN534", "B00004TJKK", "B0009S4IGA", "B001NLJ3NU", "B00AEFY4CG", "0783230524", "B001P3SA94", "B00066FAC6", "B003Y5H4ZC", "B005CGI4O6", "B000B5XOSY", "B00AMSM9AO", "B00441GZ1Y", "B00CDWQNZ4", "B00G4Q3KOC", "B00BLN4V6E", "B00EV4EUT8", "B00AEFXTKO", "B0041QSZS8", "B004A8ZWVK", "0822003082", "B00BTYPWDQ", "B000765IJK", "B000P0J0CE", "6305505780", "B005LAIH1S", "0792846443", "B002M2Z3BA", "B003ASLJK4", "B0000560W6", "B0000714BT", "B00DW5IL2E", "B00003L9CK", "B00AEBB9FA", "B002NZK5VO", "B002VWNICM", "B00AEFXP8K", "B000059TFO", "B00000JGHV", "B00AEFY6TW", "B001K98MGE", "B002U4UZQI", "B000PE0GRI", "B000P0J0EW", "0783240171", "B0018RNF60", "B001JV5BF8", "B0006IIOHC", "B00005LC4D", "B00005JLQT", "B00HW3EI3I", "B00AEFYNG8", "0783231202", "B0000WN0NW", "6305236569", "B00005B8UA", "B00005KAQP", "B0009R1TJ0", "B002VECM4A", "B003LMPKSQ", "B0058KGHX6", "B00AEFXY6I", "B00BNV9WCW", "B000JLTRH2", "B001JV5BC6", "B0041H55S0", "B000P0J0EM", "B000069I0E", "B002CAWNEM", "B005ZMBEXU", "B00005RDAN", "0156031825", "1558908390", "B002CWKU36", "B003Y5H58S", "B000YIGNHW", "B000XA5JWG", "B000BQ7J8Y", "0790731533", "B0068FZ0W4", "B00081U7HC", "B00004Y2R1", "0151191549", "0792844874"], "bought_together": ["6305428409", "B000BOH8X2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0156028352", "B004A8ZWVK", "6305428409", "B000BOH8X2"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 55488}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 15.59, "brand": "", "asin": "0790729717", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51B6EPCQKZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Color Purple"}
{"description": "Thanks to the ambitious vision of director Tim Burton, the blockbuster hit of 1989 delivers the goods despite an occasionally spotty script, giving the caped crusader a thorough overhaul in keeping with the crime fighter's evolution in DC Comics. Michael Keaton strikes just the right mood as the brooding &quot;Dark Knight&quot; of Gotham City; Kim Basinger plays Gotham's intrepid reporter Vicki Vale; and Jack Nicholson goes wild as the maniacal and scene-stealing Joker, who plots a takeover of the city with his lethal Smilex gas. Triumphant Oscar-winning production design by the late Anton Furst turnsBatmaninto a visual feast, and Burton brilliantly establishes a darkly mythic approach to Batman's legacy.

{"description": "Director William Friedkin was a hot ticket in Hollywood after the success ofThe French Connection, and he turned heads (in more ways than one) when he decided to makeThe Exorcistas his follow-up film. Adapted by William Peter Blatty from hiscontroversial bestseller, this shocking 1973 thriller set an intense and often-copied milestone for screen terror with its unflinching depiction of a young girl (Linda Blair) who is possessed by an evil spirit. Jason Miller and Max von Sydow are perfectly cast as the priests who risk their sanity and their lives to administer the rites of demonic exorcism, and Ellen Burstyn plays Blair's mother, who can only stand by in horror as her daughter's body is wracked by satanic disfiguration. One of the most frightening films ever made,The Exorcistwas mysteriously plagued by troubles during production, and the years have not diminished its capacity to disturb even the most stoical viewers. The film is presented in letterbox format on digital video disc, with a soundtrack that's guaranteed to curdle your blood.

{"description": "Stanley Kubrick'sThe Shiningis less an adaptation of Stephen King's bestselling horror novel than a complete reimagining of it from the inside out. In King's book, the Overlook Hotel is a haunted place that takes possession of its off-season caretaker and provokes him to murderous rage against his wife and young son. Kubrick's movie is an existential Road Runner cartoon (his steadicam scurrying through the hotel's labyrinthine hallways), in which the cavernously empty spaces inside the Overlook mirror the emptiness in the soul of the blocked writer, who's settled in for a long winter's hibernation. As many have pointed out, King's protagonist goes mad, but Kubrick's Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) is Looney Tunes from the moment we meet him--all arching eyebrows and mischievous grin. (Both Nicholson and Shelley Duvall reach new levels of hysteria in their performances, driven to extremes by the director's fanatical demands for take after take after take.)The Shiningis terrifying--but not in the way fans of the novel might expect. When it was redone as a TV miniseries (reportedly because of King's dissatisfaction with the Kubrick film), the famous topiary-animal attack (which was deemed impossible to film in 1980) was there--but the deeper horror was lost.

{"description": "Winner of four Academy Awards, including best picture, director, supporting actor, and best editing, Clint Eastwood's 1992 masterpiece stands as one of the greatest and most thematically compelling Westerns ever made. &quot;The movie summarized everything I feel about the Western,&quot; said Eastwood at the time of the film's release. &quot;The moral is the concern with gunplay.&quot; To illustrate that theme, Eastwood stars as a retired, once-ruthless killer-turned-gentle-widower and hog farmer. He accepts one last bounty-hunter mission--to find the men who brutalized a prostitute--to help support his two motherless children. Joined by his former partner (Morgan Freeman) and a cocky greenhorn (Jaimz Woolvett), he takes on a corrupt sheriff (Oscar winner Gene Hackman) in a showdown that makes the viewer feel the full impact of violence and its corruption of the soul. Dedicated to Eastwood's mentors Sergio Leone and Don Siegel and featuring a colorful role for Richard Harris, it's arguably Eastwood's crowning directorial achievement.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B003ASLJS6", "B003ASLJRC", "6304698801", "B000N3SSBW", "B0000TANUI", "6304711905", "0783225725", "B000E5N6LG", "B00388PK7O", "0767817710", "B001LMAK88", "B00000K0DM", "B003ASLJO0", "B000XR9L50", "0792839056", "B002M9WW3A", "B003ASLJOU", "B0015XHQT4", "B003ASLJNQ", "B000055Y0Y", "B003AWRMBU", "B003ASLJIQ", "B000O599ZS", "6304698798", "B000GFRI4K", "B00AEBBA0E", "B003UESJME", "B0018PH3L0", "B00AEBB932", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00008IHAW", "B0045HCJTO", "B00HETDQKG", "0783228007", "B004FPXMDI", "B007Y1NR1W", "B000P0J0EW", "B00AEFXVOI", "B000059TFW", "B003ASLJQI", "B00AEFYSEA", "B003ASLJKE", "B004AOECXI", "B003AWRMBA", "B00005LOL0", "B001LRJH0U", "B00001ZWUS", "B000W1SZBS", "B001M9ELQ2", "B000056H2J", "B003AWRM9M", "B00AEFYL6K", "B003AWRMC4", "B0006GANN2", "B000O599WQ", "B000NQRR34", "B0045HCJSK", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B00AEBB8YM", "B00008CMT4", "B003ASLJQS", "B0008ENHUS", "B00008CMR4", "B00AEBB9NM", "B000O599Y4", "0792842502", "6304696612", "B003NF97MQ", "B0010DR4BO", "B0007MAO0C", "B0006GAOJA", "0792838408", "B003AWRM9W", "B00009W5CA", "B00066FBQG", "B000O599YE", "0767830555", "078322592X", "B000BDH6DU", "B000BITVBA", "B003ASLJJU", "B001KRVLCI", "B0000A2ZU1", "B000P0J09M", "B00008PX7J", "B00005LC4R", "B00B0U2SFE", "B002VWNIBI", "B0010YVCI4", "B004SIP7ZS", "B002O3Z4XE", "B00132D7Y0", "079284646X", "B003XURDAY", "B003ASLJK4", "B0001FVDJQ", "B00004XPPC", "B00AEBB9CS", "B0007MANYY", "6304698747"], "bought_together": ["B003ASLJS6", "B003ASLJRC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003ASLJRC", "B003ASLJS6", "0792842502", "B004AOECXI"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 104810}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.95, "brand": "WARNER STUDIOS", "asin": "0790729644", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DRkkBZz0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Unforgiven (Snap Case)"}

Arthur falls in love with a waitress (Liza Minnelli) who doesn't care about his money, but unfortunately Arthur's stern father wants him to marry a Waspy prima donna. The young lush turns to his wise and loyal butler (Oscar-winner John Gielgud) for assistance and advice.Arthurwas a huge hit when released in 1981, as was its Oscar-winning theme song by Christopher Cross.

{"description": "Inspired by the 1960s TV series that starred James Garner in the title role, this lightweight Western from 1994 proved to be a surprising box-office hit. Well, maybe not such a big surprise, since it's from the star and director of theLethal Weaponmovies, and operates with a similar combination of mainstream plotting and easygoing humor. Mel Gibson stars as card-playing gunslinger Brett Maverick, who meets up with wily gambler Annabelle Bransford (Jodie Foster) and a marshal named Zane Cooper (James Garner, trading his old role to Gibson) on his way to the World Series of poker in St. Louis. Maverick's trying to raise the $5,000 needed to join the high-stakes contest, but that's easier said than done due to a lot of unscrupulous competition and a twisting plot of tricks and deceptions. It's all played for laughs and action, so the movie never wears out its welcome, despite a running time that could've used a good trimming. It's also fun to see the rapport between Gibson and Garner, as if the present and former Mavericks were a kind of surrogate son and father, bonded by their mutual skill in charming and conning their way through tight spots. Director Richard Donner also pays tribute to old Westerns by casting veterans of the genre in cameo roles (including Bert Remsen, Dub Taylor, and Denver Pyle), and Gibson'sLethal Weaponcostar Danny Glover pops in for a surprise appearance. None of this really adds up to much since the movie makes no pretense about taking itself seriously, but that's precisely why audiences found it so entertaining.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0013D8M4E", "B001DDBD4K", "B000FO0AA6", "B00AEBB9WI", "B002GHHHNI", "B002GOAH1A", "B000056H2E", "0790731460", "B000FO0A9W", "B003AWRMBA", "0783227396", "B00DDT0JB0", "B000056H2F", "B007AAF3FK", "6305213283", "B00B00HUC0", "6305236569", "B00007GZR1", "B00158K0QU", "B0003JAOCC", "B000ARXF96", "B00008DDXA", "B002VWNID6", "B00368PSKK", "B00006SFKE", "B000CEV3M8", "6305428077", "B001ECDVJU", "B004CTG6TO", "B000ENC5YW", "B00003CXJ1", "B00AEBB8YW", "B00000IQW5", "B000JJSJPK", "6305127646", "B00AEFY0F2", "B000E5N6LG", "B00005ATZT", "B000BGR1B4", "B000Y11BC6", "0767827813", "B00ALTQRRK", "B001LMAK88", "B000FTCLQC", "B00008G7QH", "B00AEFY4CG", "B002LFQIL2", "B000JYW5BE", "B00AEBB8NS", "0792838408", "B002NZK5UU", "B000683VI4", "B002KE4ZJG", "B00507O3II", "078322740X", "B0001V1M6E", "B002O3Z4XE", "6304765266", "B004ZRFQCG", "B00936A1ZG", "B000XJD3K2", "B000N4RASS", "B000EGDB10", "B00005LOL0", "B00AEFXYOA", "B00AEFYTEY", "B000BF0C8E", "B000N2HD6O", "B000A0GXGA", "B001JFKWE4", "B002XDR5NM", "B004AOECXI", "B008JFURII"], "bought_together": ["B00DDT0JB0", "0790731460"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00DDT0JB0", "0790731460", "B007AAF3FK", "B000BGR1B4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 71477}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.69, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "0790731940", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516B6P3CKFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Maverick (Snap Case Packaging)"}

{"description": "The opening and closing moments of Robert (Forrest Gump) Zemeckis'sContactastonish viewers with the sort of breathtaking conceptual imagery one hardly ever sees in movies these days--each is an expression of the heroine's lifelong quest (both spiritual and scientific) to explore the meaning of human existence through contact with extraterrestrial life. The movie begins by soaring far out into space, then returns dizzyingly to earth until all the stars in the heavens condense into the sparkle in one little girl's eye. It ends with that same girl as an adult (Jodie Foster)--her search having taken her to places beyond her imagination--turning her gaze inward and seeing the universe in a handful of sand.Contacttraces the journey between those two visual epiphanies. Based on Carl Sagan's novel,Contactis exceptionally thoughtful and provocative for a big-budget Hollywood science fiction picture, with elements that recall everything from2001toThe Right Stuff. Foster's solid performance (and some really incredible alien hardware) keep viewers interested, even when the story skips and meanders, or when the halo around the golden locks of rising-star-of-a-different-kind Matthew McConaughey (as the pure-Hollywood-hokum love interest) reaches Milky Way-level wattage. Ambitious, ambiguous, pretentious, unpredictable--Contactis all of these things and more. Much of it remains open to speculation and interpretation, but whatever conclusions one eventually draws,Contactdeserves recognition as a rare piece of big-budget studio filmmaking on a personal scale.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0002V7OI8", "0783225733", "B0045HCJ9O", "B004L9GMBC", "B00008G8LY", "B00003CWU3", "B0045HCJ0S", "B0006FYOTC", "0671004107", "630471193X", "B002O3Z50G", "B000VECAD0", "B004GJYRI2", "630542845X", "B00000G3PA", "B002ZG980U", "B000BYY11Y", "B00005JL3T", "B0000844I8", "B00I116MUC", "B00013RC84", "B0050MB5KM", "B0087F7VSY", "B00008OE4W", "B00006JDVV", "B0015NORDW", "B00004BZIY", "B003AWRMBA", "B00003CXXP", "B00E8G5HQE", "B00IWULQQ2", "B007Y1NNAW", "B0000A2ZO0", "0783225547", "B00005JKFR", "B001BEK8CY", "B000E6ESEO", "0767812166", "B000OA8OK4", "B00007GZR5", "6305133468", "B001GCUO02", "B005LAII3A", "0767805712", "B000NA1WDQ", "B00005JNY3", "B000YDOOHI", "B000ENC5YW", "B002NZK5UU", "079073639X", "B0043X1FL8", "B00000JMOD", "B004SIP9RO", "0783225814", "B00004YA66", "B000FVQLKW", "B00008G8M4", "B00005JOC9", "B000CEV3M8", "B000CEXEWA", "B001BRJZPW", "B001451HXO", "B0045HCJKS", "B007RGAC7G", "B00AEBB9F0", "B00AEFY3MC", "B00000IQW5", "B001ECDVK4", "B004AOECXI", "B0013FDM7E", "B000053VBK", "B002GHHHP6", "B00AEFXPSK", "B0007PLLBU", "B00AEFY0F2", "B002GHHHNI", "B000PGINMQ", "B0007TKNHE"], "bought_together": ["B0002V7OI8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004L9GMBC", "B002ZG980U", "0671004107", "B000VECAD0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 88991}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.49, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "0790733226", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/412wFQ6h37L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Contact (Snap Case)"}
{"description": "Too old for Hamlet and too young for Lear--what's an ambitious actor to do? Play the Devil, of course. Jack Nicholson did it inThe Witches of Eastwick; Robert De Niro did it inAngel Heart(as Louis Cyphre--get it?). InThe Devil's AdvocateAl Pacino takes his turn as the great Satan, and clearly relishes his chance to raise hell. He's a New York lawyer, of course, by the name of John Milton, who recruits a hotshot young Florida attorney (Keanu Reeves) to his firm and seduces him with tempting offers of power, sex, and money. Think of the story as a twist on John Grisham'sThe Firm, with the corporate evil made even more explicit. Reeves is wooden, and therefore doesn't seem to have much of a soul to lose, but he's really just our excuse to meet the devil. Pacino's the main attraction, gleefully showing off his--and the Antichrist's--chops at perpetrating menace and mayhem. The film was directed by Taylor Hackford (Against All Odds,Dolores Claiborne).--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302256615"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 327803}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 0.81, "brand": "", "asin": "0790736527", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41WDM3NVKAL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Devil's Advocate [VHS]"}
{"description": "After Hammer Studios' tremendous success withThe Curse of Frankenstein, they struck a deal to adapt Universal's catalog of classics and set their sights first onDracula. Christopher Lee removes the monstrous makeup from the earlier film and makes his entrance as an elegant, confident, altogether seductive Dracula, a frightening figure of flashing eyes and erotic allure. Peter Cushing, with his hawklike profile and piercing eyes, turns his rationalist intensity to Van Helsing: man of science as crusading vampire hunter. Director Terence Fisher and screenwriter Jimmy Sangster make a few changes to Bram Stoker's tale; gone are Renfield, Transylvania, howling wolves, and transformations into bats. The Count is an old-world aristocrat firmly ensconced in a castle in England and Van Helsing a crusading vampire hunter who plots his demise with an elaborate plan. This is the first film to really mine the erotic appeal of vampires: Dracula seduces Mina and Lucy like a devil tempting good to the dark side through sex--more suggestive than explicit, but daring for 1958. Lee is electric as the ferocious Count, despite his limited screen time, and Cushing turns Van Helsing into a virtual swashbuckler of a hero, leaping and diving through the climax like an aging action hero. Cushing reprises his role inThe Brides of Dracula, while Lee absented himself from the series until 1966'sDracula: Prince of Darkness.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["1564427099", "0790736098", "0790736071", "6302814707", "6302503507", "6305095566", "6303149189", "6300208052", "6300183092", "0792845552", "6300183629", "6300181278"], "also_viewed": ["0790736098", "1564427099", "0790736071", "B00BPX7K5Y"]}, "price": 59.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 607938}, "asin": "0790736101", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/513ZKF03WDL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Horror of Dracula [VHS]"}

{"description": "Novelist Leon Uris wrote the script for this Western directed by John Sturges (The Magnificent Seven) and based on the life and times of Wyatt Earp (Burt Lancaster) and his sickly companion, Doc Holliday (Kirk Douglas). The action inevitably leads to the legendary battle between the two heroes and the villainous Clanton gang, but the film is also very much about the conflicts each man faces with women, with one another, and with their own destinies. Lancaster is terrific as the downbeat Earp, and Douglas has one of his best roles as the consumptive Holliday. The thoughtfulness of the tale is matched by Sturges's captivating way with the dramatic duel. All in all, the film appeals both as a solid action piece and as a fascinating, two-character study.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305237115", "6301395395", "6301977297", "B000A9QK8M", "B0007MAO0C", "6301801733", "B00005JLUH", "6303393985", "6303257801", "6301798759", "6304111363", "0800100832", "0792107683", "6304429711", "079283853X", "0792110188", "6302718961", "0792837371", "B000056BRF", "0783222955", "B000BWIZRW", "0792106989", "079284517X", "0792838548", "6303269826", "0792110463", "6300215830", "6304457316", "B00005RRG6", "0783227221", "1558807780", "0792839846", "B00000FZCU", "6300269043", "6301805615", "6301805518", "B00000F6D1", "630152859X", "6300269639", "0784001294", "6304291698", "B00000F13T", "6301798600", "6300268799", "B00004RFFA", "6301628454", "6302503515", "B00004WZR1", "6301972341", "0767809262", "6303282237"], "bought_together": ["6301395395"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 358567}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.97, "brand": "", "asin": "079210952X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51A721QDFTL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Gunfight at the O.K.

{"description": "Consciously crafted by director George Stevens as a piece of American mythmaking, Shane is on nearly everyone's shortlist of great movie Westerns. A buckskin knight, Shane (Alan Ladd) rides into the middle of a range war between farmers and cattlemen, quickly siding with the \"sod-busters.\" While helping a kindly farmer (Van Heflin), Shane falls platonically in love with the man's wife (Jean Arthur, in the last screen performance of a marvelous career). Though the showdowns are exciting, and the story simple but involving, what most people will remember about this movie is the friendship between the stoical Shane and the young son of the farmers. The kid is played by Brandon De Wilde, who gives one of the most amazing child performances in the movies; his parting scene with Shane is guaranteed to draw tears from even the most stonyhearted moviegoer. And speaking of stony hearts, Jack Palance made a sensational impression as the evil gunslinger sent to clean house--he has fewer lines of dialogue than he has lines in his magnificently craggy face, but he makes them count. The photography, highlighting the landscape near Jackson Hole, Wyoming, won an Oscar.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["630197705X", "0782008348", "0792106989", "630442972X", "B000056BRF", "630150528X", "B000O599ZS", "6300184951", "6304119038", "6305576173", "6301975987", "6300215962", "0792840836", "6303560040", "6300215741", "6304239149", "6302842263", "B000006N70", "6303854311", "1558802010", "0792838556", "6301325508", "6300215644", "B000M5BRX2", "6304457316", "6304196873", "0783221347", "630266232X", "6302909023", "0783215517", "0790733935", "0792841859", "6302640504", "6300183513", "6300216500", "6301969316", "0790743213", "6303072798", "6300215512", "0800100832", "0800104803", "6301798562", "0790743531", "6303562248", "0767825411", "0792107128", "6303039693", "6303402070", "0783235682", "079284517X", "6300269884", "6304457278", "6301798503", "6301976924", "6301670159", "B00000F13T", "6304071876", "B000M7BEPQ", "6301798759", "0783235593", "6300267938", "6300268748", "1555265952", "6300181340", "6304039530", "6301797957", "B00004RFFA", "6300214567", "6301599225", "6302529441", "B000021Y6K", "6304383169", "0792116887", "6302878535", "6301976622", "079284520X", "6304359705", "0792102320", "B00005R2E1", "6302484421", "1558807780", "6301586026", "0790733897", "6301965957", "0790752395", "6301670140", "6302715555", "0783216084", "6304359721", "6304111398", "6301706587", "6302278929", "6302130379", "6301969049", "6300183580", "6304508611", "B0002IXSVI", "6301971809", "0783235623"], "bought_together": ["630197705X"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 87936}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.99, "brand": "", "asin": "0792107683", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51NV73BNF7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Shane [VHS]"}
{"description": "A stupendous historical saga,Braveheartwon five Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Director for star Mel Gibson. He plays William Wallace, a 13th-century Scottish commoner who unites the various clans against a cruel English King, Edward the Longshanks (Patrick McGoohan). The scenes of hand-to-hand combat are brutally violent, but they never glorify the bloodshed. There is such enormous scope to this story that it works on a smaller, more personal scale as well, essaying love and loss, patriotism and passion. Extremely moving, it reveals Gibson as a multitalented performer and remarkable director with an eye for detail and an understanding of human emotion. (His first directorial effort was 1993'sMan Without a Face.) The film is nearly three hours long and includes several plot tangents, yet is never dull. This movie resonates long after you have seen it, both for its visual beauty and for its powerful story.--Rochelle O'Gorman", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00004XPQ6", "B00003CXE6", "6303953425", "6304935811", "B0001VL30O", "B000054OW2", "6302415853", "0790741512", "6304071876", "6301792734", "6303168507", "6303942830", "0800125762", "6300183211", "B000007OY0", "B000056BRF", "6300214540", "B000065U6Q", "B00004WIDB", "B00003CXTF", "B00007KK15", "079070546X", "B0000A36J1", "B00000K3AN", "6302482712", "6300263673", "6305169187", "0788811355", "B00003BE3X", "0800116917", "6304414099", "6303020089", "0792133153", "0790744589", "6302909023", "0800132009", "079212569X", "6300185095", "6303313345", "0767819462", "6304259131", "B00000K2SC", "0800199421", "B0001DI5W6", "B00005JLTM", "630018224X", "0790701251", "6304151306", "6303696813", "0790731274", "0792147618", "B00005RIJ3", "6301586026", "6302945089", "0783223218", "6305718792"], "bought_together": ["B00004XPQ6", "B00003CXE6"], "also_viewed": ["0792151712", "6303314015", "6301966988", "6303402348", "B00004WIDB", "0792116887", "6300213668", "0800125762", "B00004XPQ6", "0792842111", "B00003CXTF", "0788812408", "6302526574", "6303215734", "0788806270", "6300183211", "B00004U8P4", "0788802194"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 256531}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.94, "brand": "", "asin": "079213690X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5109NVE2R9L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Braveheart [VHS]"}

{"description": "Mel Gibson's Oscar-winning 1995Braveheartis an impassioned epic about William Wallace, the 13th-century Scottish leader of a popular revolt against England's tyrannical Edward I (Patrick McGoohan). Gibson cannily plays Wallace as a man trying to stay out of history's way until events force his hand, an attribute that instantly resonates with several of the actor's best-known roles, especiallyMad Max. The subsequent camaraderie and courage Wallace shares in the field with fellow warriors is pure enough and inspiring enough to bring envy to a viewer, and even as things go wrong for Wallace in the second half, the film does not easily cave in to a somber tone.

{"description": "The only remaining evidence that Sylvester Stallone might have had a respectable career, this 1976 Oscar winner (for Best Picture, Director, and Editing) is still the quintessential ode to an underdog and one of the best boxing movies ever made. After writing the script about a two-bit boxer who gets a &quot;million-to-one shot&quot; against the world heavyweight champion, Stallone insisted that he star in the title role, and his equally unknown status helped to catapult him (and this rousing film) to overnight success. The story is familiar, but it has been handled with such vitality and emotional honesty that you can't help but leap and cheer for Rocky Balboa, the chump turned champ (despite his valiant defeat in the ring) who stuns the boxing world with the support of his timid girlfriend, Adrian (Talia Shire), and grizzled trainer, Gus (Burgess Meredith). Oscar nominations went to all the lead actors (including Burt Young as Adrian's hot-tempered brother), but four sequels could never top the universal appeal of this low-budget crowd pleaser.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0006GAOG8", "B0006GAO6I", "B0006GAOGI", "B000N4SHPS", "B0006GAOGS", "B007STBUHI", "B00005MEOU", "B000ICM5O4", "B00AEFY0F2", "6304907729", "B00004W221", "B000IJ79UW", "B00000HZY2", "B007N31YH0", "B00004XPPC", "B004FQX5A2", "B0014Z4OMU", "B00003CXBU", "B0008JIJ2E", "B000XJD34I", "B007SPPANM", "B000ARTN3I", "B0001US8F8", "B000KX0IOA", "B003ASLJQI", "0792843592", "0780021312", "B00079Z9VO", "B00J2AU8MY", "B001LXIDVI", "B0068FZ0GK", "B00AEBB9FA", "B000BYA4HE", "B000EHRVOW", "B00006ADD5", "B0010AN7Z4", "B00066FBQG", "B000BITV92", "B0087ZG7HK", "B000IJ79WU", "B000059H9A", "B000ZM1MG4", "B0002WZTOI", "B0001US66Y", "B0049985XW", "B001GZ6QC4", "B000VECAD0", "B006FE83UE", "0792838041", "0800177258", "B004SIP7F8", "B00005JKCH", "B00AEFY6DI", "B00008K76U", "B00AEBB9F0", "B001AEF6BS", "B00004BZIY", "B004QBWU02", "B0060ZJ7BC", "B00011D1OK", "B00004TVUD", "B000HE2ZUW"], "bought_together": ["B0006GAOG8", "B0006GAO6I"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000WC3A0S", "B004FQX5C0", "B00J4BW10S", "B000N4SHPS"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 405226}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.85, "brand": "", "asin": "079283321X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51AP5MY2B5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Rocky (1976)"}
{"description": "MGM's bold idea to remake George Cukor's Oscar-winning upperclass romantic farce,The Philadelphia Story, into a star-studded, Technicolor musical with Cole Porter tunes somehow works splendidly and remains an underrated gem. Even the plot and character names--and some bits of dialogue--all remain the same as the original. Crooning Bing Crosby replaces Cary Grant as the wealthy ex-husband trying to win back his soon-to-be-remarried ex-wife, spoiled ice queen Tracy Lord (Grace Kelly, stunning and aloof in her last film role, originated in the earlier comedy by Katherine Hepburn). Unlike Grant, however, Crosby has jazz great Louis Armstrong, playing himself, in his corner for quixotic persuasion. Frank Sinatra (cocky in James Stewart's former role) and Celeste Holm add support as the nosy reporters covering, and subsequently complicating, the upcoming wedding. Sure,High Societylacks the original's witty satire, sarcasm, and character complexity; but it's assuredly paced and wonderfully acted, and contains enough romantic chemistry to keep the plot engaging. And then there's the music. Unlike the grandiose production numbers of many '40s and '50s musicals,High Society's musical sequences are considerably low-key and intimate, focusing on Porter's lyrical content, and the style in which it's delivered by the charismatic performers. Armstrong kicks the film off in telling style: he sings the title track, a calypso tune outlining the plot like a Greek chorus, not as an elaborately choreographed song-and-dance number, but instead stuffed claustrophobically in the back of a limousine with his jazz band. Other musical standouts include Sinatra and Crosby playfully tossing barbs during \"Well, Did You Evah?\"; Crosby and Armstrong teaming up for an energetic clash of styles in \"Now You Has Jazz\"; the two soaring, archetypal ballads by the leads--Crosby's \"I Love You, Samantha\" and Sinatra's superior \"You're Sensational\"; and, finally, the satirical Sinatra/Holm duet, \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?,\" the closestHigh Societyever comes to social or class commentary.--Dave McCoy", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302363292", "0792840836", "0792840844", "0792837630", "6300215660", "6303494390", "B00004RV8M", "6300183513", "6300215741", "6303444202", "630197736X", "6300183580", "6305282927", "B0000040EO", "0783221347", "630150528X", "155880997X", "0782006809", "6301586026", "B00000F6D1", "B00004TRD5", "630233683X", "0782006779", "6302227127", "0790744759", "0792839846", "6301670140", "6302484391", "6300215695", "6303209890", "0792840860", "6300181529", "B00005LMA7", "6303394019", "B000056BRF", "6301278410", "B000EW1RBA", "0800100832", "6300251152", "6301964012", "0782008348", "630266232X", "1558807780", "0783235593", "6303333079", "630290899X", "B00003OSTO"], "bought_together": ["6302363292", "0792840844"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 285126}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.99, "brand": "", "asin": "0792837649", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DXMQJX2DL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "High Society [VHS]"}

{"description": "FutureNightmarecreator andScreamweaver Wes Craven's  film debut is a primitive little production that rises above its cut-rate  production values and hazy, grainy patina via its grimly affecting portrait  of human evil infiltrating a middle-class household. The story is adapted  from Ingmar Bergman'sThe Virgin Spring, but the film has more in  common with Sam Peckinpah'sStraw Dogsas it charts the descent of a  harmless married couple into methodical killers. A quartet of criminals--a  distorted version of the nuclear family--kidnaps a pair of teenage girls and  proceeds to ravage, rape, torture, and finally brutally murder them in the  woods, unwittingly within walking distance of their rural home. The killers  take refuge in the girls' own home, but when the parents discover just who  they are and what they've done, they plot violent retribution.Along with George Romero'sNight of the Living Deadand Tobe Hooper'sTexas Chainsaw Massacre, Craven helped redefine American horror with  this debut--all three movies portray modern society crumbling into madness  and horror. But, unlike his fellow directors, Craven gives his film an  uncomfortable verisimilitude, setting it squarely in the heartland of modern  America. While at times it's awkward and inconsistent, with distracting comic  interludes, his handling of the brutal horror scenes is unsettling, and the  death of the daughter is an unexpectedly quiet and lyrical moment.--Sean  Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792839242", "6302921058", "B00000K0DU", "6300214311", "6300182770", "B00000IQUT"], "also_viewed": ["6302921058"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 475308}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.78, "brand": "", "asin": "079284632X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/512ZWA7XGZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Last House on the Left [VHS]"}

Pulsating with seductive energy, this provocative drama is as visually arresting as it is intellectually engrossing. Arthur Miller based his classic 1953 play on the actual Salem witch trials of 1692, creating what has since become a durable fixture of school drama courses. It may look like a historical drama, but Miller also meant the work as a parable for the misery created by the McCarthy anti-Communist hearings of the 1950s. This searing version of his drama delves into matters of conscience with concise accuracy and emotional honesty.

{"description": "Here's a model for adapting a novel into a movie. The bestseller by James Jones, a frank and hard-hitting look at military life, could not possibly be made into a film in 1953 without considerably altering its length and bold subject matter. Yet screenwriter Daniel Taradash and director Fred Zinnemann (both of whom won Oscars for their work) pared it down and cleaned it up, without losing the essential texture of Jones's tapestry. The setting is an army base in Hawaii in 1941. Montgomery Clift, in a superb performance, plays a bugler who refuses to fight for the company boxing team; he has reasons for giving up the sport. His refusal results in harsh treatment from the company commander, whose bored wife (Deborah Kerr) is having an affair with the tough-but-fair sergeant (Burt Lancaster). You remember--the scene with the two of them embracing on the beach, as the surf crashes in. The supporting players are as good as the leads: Frank Sinatra and Donna Reed won Oscars (and Sinatra revitalized his entire career), and Ernest Borgnine entered the gallery of all-time movie villains, as the stockade sergeant who makes Sinatra miserable. Zinnemann's work is efficient but also evocative, capturing the time and place beautifully, the tropical breezes as well as the lazy prewar indulgence. This one is deservedly a classic.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305261296", "6302226899", "6302413435", "6305123616", "079284517X", "6302413400", "0783221347", "0783222955", "B000005PPB", "0800113055", "6301586026", "6303057225", "6300215644", "6303402070", "6300215741", "0790743159", "6301976983", "6302877873", "B0000048YM", "630150528X", "0793910323", "6302000661", "1558807780", "6300216012", "6302120624", "6302842263", "6302700949", "6302360978", "6300246965", "6304111398", "6301628454", "6304291698", "0800132009", "6301578805", "6301706587", "6301975987", "6300216721", "6302593220", "6301670140", "630442972X", "0792107683", "6301670159", "6304359705", "6301955293", "6301798503", "6301976622", "6301599225", "1558808590", "B00000F13M", "6300183890", "6300267865", "0792101448", "6301797957", "6301973232", "0782008348", "6301564456", "0792110269", "6301798732", "B000M5BRX2", "6301969294", "0783235623", "6302484391", "0790743213", "6300215962", "6300147355", "630266232X", "6300182304", "6303282237", "0792841026", "0790733935", "0792837967", "6301959728", "0783236352", "6302779782", "6302640504", "B0000048YO", "6304383169", "6302238331", "6301640667", "6300214826", "6300181421", "6303029027", "6300181340", "6304429274", "0792837096", "6301973259", "6303560040", "6302753198", "6304056915", "0792837630", "6303943004", "6302797713", "0782006779", "6301798759", "6302278929", "6300246868", "630533577X", "0792837649", "6304935811", "0800100816"], "bought_together": ["6305123616"], "also_viewed": ["6304117752", "0783222955", "0783221347", "6303215734", "6304429274"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 203870}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.0, "brand": "", "asin": "0800100832", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4157079C8HL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "From Here to Eternity [VHS]"}
{"description": "This 1993 film by David Anspaugh (Hoosiers) is slowly building a reputation as a minor highlight of '90s movies. Based on a true story,Rudystars Sean Astin as Rudy Ruettiger, a blue-collar kid whose father (Ned Beatty) worships Notre Dame football but who would never dare to dream that any of his sons could be a part of the team. The film is entirely about Ruettiger's ceaseless if sometimes wavering commitment toward that goal, despite tremendous obstacles in physical stature, education requirements, the dismissiveness of coaches, poverty, his father's envy, and endless delays of one kind or another. This is the sort of film that looks back on a life and says the battle was its own reward, not the glory.

{"description": "One of the best romantic comedies of the 1990s, this box-office hit cemented writer-director Cameron Crowe's reputation as &quot;the voice of a generation.&quot; Crowe could probably do without that label, but he's definitely in sync with the times with this savvy story about a sports agent (Tom Cruise) whose fall from grace motivates his quest for professional recovery, and the slow-dawning realization that he needs the love and respect of the single mom (Ren&eacute;e Zellweger in her breakthrough role) who has supported him through the worst of times. This is one of Cruise's best, most underrated performances, and in an Oscar-winning role, Cuba Gooding Jr. plays the football star who remains Jerry Maguire's only loyal client on a hard road to redemption and personal growth. If that sounds touchy-feely, it is only because Crowe has combined sharp entertainment with a depth of character that is rarely found in mainstream comedy.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000065V3G", "B0000YEEGM", "B000GAKDAG", "0767811100", "B0018QPPXW", "B0002WZTOI", "B00005B6JZ", "B00AEFXR1K", "B004SIP7ZS", "B00AEBB9WI", "0783226810", "B00081U7HC", "B00AEFY4CG", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00AEFXYJA", "B000XJD33O", "B00AEBB9LO", "B000G6BLHY", "B0068FZ0GK", "B000023VTP", "B004SEUJK0", "B00158K0QU", "B000MNOX94", "B00AEFXESQ", "B001ECDVK4", "B000957O82", "B0000DIXDR", "0780631536", "0783225733", "B00004W221", "B000EGDB10", "B0010YSD8Q", "B000056VP4", "630471193X", "B00005JG6N", "B000P0J0EW", "B00005JL78", "0800141806", "B00005JKG9", "0790730979", "B002VECM6S", "B0000AOV4I", "B000CCBCAS", "B000HRMAPE", "B0006GANPA", "6305236569", "B00005O5CM", "B00011CZRE", "B0038Z5T4Q", "B000053VB4", "B003ASLJQS", "B0000524E4", "B00AEFXE9U", "B00006ZXSL", "078324021X", "B000765IJK", "B00AEFY99O", "B00AEBB8NS", "B0002V7ON8", "B00015YVDG", "B002AT8KD8", "B007SPPANM", "0783233477", "B000035Z5G", "B007STBUHI", "B004SIP9U6", "B000E5N684", "B00AEFXYOA", "B001LGXIA6", "B002GOAGZC", "B000FI8MPW", "B002O3Z510", "B000N6U0E2", "B000069HZP", "B00AEFY5B6", "B000068NNU", "B00001ZWUS", "B004AOECXI", "B00AEFXN9G", "B000YDBPAM", "B002ZG9864", "B003QO8TOQ", "0792843592", "B0013FCWUW", "B000P0J0EM", "B000QQLVPQ", "B000HEWEE4", "B0001AVZA8", "B00000G3PA", "B000XT1P3E", "B0006N2EZ0", "B00008G8LM", "B00005JNTI", "6304765266", "B00AEFXT1S", "B003UESJHO", "B00004WG2F", "B00005T7HW", "B004L3AR0K", "6305128952"], "bought_together": ["B0002WZTOI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001680M26", "B0002WZTOI", "0792838467", "B000065V3G"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 8726}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.0, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "0800141741", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51KBVJ813VL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Jerry Maguire"}
{"description": "Superior to Martin Scorsese's punishing 1991 remake, this 1962 thriller directed by J. Lee Thompson (The Guns of Navarone) stars Robert Mitchum as a creepy ex-con angry at the attorney (Gregory Peck) whom he believes is responsible for his incarceration. After Mitchum makes clear his plans to harm Peck's family, a fascinating game of crisscrossing ethics and morality takes place. Where the more recent version seemed trapped in its explicitness, Thompson's film accomplishes a lot with a more economical and telling use of violence.

{"description": "This strange, 1985 experiment by Ridley Scott (Blade Runner) starred the up-and-coming Tom Cruise in a fairy-tale world of dwarfs and unicorns and demons. After the horn of a unicorn is broken, darkness and winter descend upon the world. Cruise's character, helped along by a magic sprite played by David Bennent (The Tin Drum), descends into hell to save paradise. This movie is almost a classic case of art direction gone amok. The somewhat amorphous Cruise doesn't lend much dramatic focus or artistic definition, but the drama between Tim Curry's satanic majesty and Mia Sara's character, who becomes a sort of princess of the netherworld, is pretty captivating.

{"description": "[...] A bizarre and unexplainable cosmic event has forever changed the Earth's ant population as we know it. Around the globe, ants are communicating at a level previously thought impossible and organizing themselves in such a manner to suggest the formation of a collective mind. Biologist, Dr. Ernest Hubbs (Nigel Davenport,The Island of Dr. Moreau 77) and information specialist, James Lesko (Michael Murphy,Count Yorga,Vampire) have traveled to the small desert town of Paradise City to research the most recent occurrences of odd ant behavior. The community, once occupied with golf courses and county clubs, has become a barren landscape, as a gathering of ants has driven the town s population to abandon their homes. In their place, the bugs have constructed an impressive number of towering monoliths, which strike upward toward the hot desert sky.[...] If watching insects and other creepy-crawlies makes you squirm in your seat,Phase IVmay not be for you. The film's first eight minutes are almost entirely comprised of ants scurrying around, often framed in close up, almost microscopic shots. This footage was the work of micro photographer Ken Middleham, who would focus his camera on the insect world a year later for William Castle sBug. Such a realistic take on one of Mother Nature s smallest creatures is in stark contrast to similar science fiction fare of the period. Films likeThem!orEmpire of the Antsfound their conflict by enlarging such critters to make them more overtly threatening. By keeping the insects a familiar size,Phase IVis able to remain planted in reality, while exploring topics that are anything but. The threat seems more eminent as the human race finds itself being threatened, not by being overpowered physically, but by being knocked down a step on the evolutionary ladder.[...] While the narrative is admittedly not its strongest facet and many may find the film's plot a slow burn, the atmosphere and pace are deliberate and highly effective under the capable direction of Mr. Bass. Saul was a master at graphic design and knew exactly how and where to place images for optimal effect. With very little dialogue to work with, Saul let s the landscapes and environments help lead the plot along, pushing you deeper into the story. You can feel the heat and desperation of the desert town just as thick as you can sense the urgency within the two scientists as they bustle frantically around their research facility, anxiously looking for a way to lower the temperature.Saul and writer Mayo Simon (Futureworld) were not about to leave you with any clear explanations either.Phase IVraises more questions than it answers, but does so with a clever hand, so as not to leave you feeling cheated. [...] Legend Films has presentedPhase IVin a commendable 1.78:1 widescreen anamorphic transfer. Colors are strong and vibrate, with only few specks of grain and debris that appear to be normal aging of the source print. The mono English audio is easy to follow and complements Brian Gascoigne electronic score well. Dipping deep into the vaults at Paramount, Legend Films has thankfully pluckedPhase IV, as well as a number of other genre titles, from obscurity, gratefully allowing them a second life on the digital format.

{"description": "The classic science fiction novel by Ray Bradbury was a curious choice for one of the leading directors of the French New Wave, Fran&ccedil;ois Truffaut. But from the opening credits onward (spoken, not written on screen), Truffaut takes Bradbury's fascinating premise and makes it his own. The futuristic society depicted inFahrenheit 451is a culture without books. Firemen still race around in red trucks and wear helmets, but their job is to start fires: they ferret out forbidden stashes of books, douse them with gasoline, and make public bonfires. Oskar Werner, the star of Truffaut'sJules and Jim, plays a fireman named Montag, whose exposure toDavid Copperfieldwakens an instinct toward reading and individual thought. (That's why books are banned--they give people too many ideas.) In an intriguing casting flourish, Julie Christie plays two roles: Montag's bored, drugged-up wife and the woman who helps kindle the spark of rebellion. The great Bernard Herrmann wrote the hard-driving music; Nicolas Roeg provided the cinematography.Fahrenheit 451received a cool critical reception and has never quite been accepted by Truffaut fans or sci-fi buffs. Its deliberately listless manner has always been a problem, although that is part of its point; the lack of reading has made people dry and empty. If the movie is a bit stiff (Truffaut did not speak English well and never tried another project in English), it nevertheless is full of intriguing touches, and the ending is lyrical and haunting.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792839846"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 113753}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 18.74, "brand": "MCA Universal", "asin": "6300184250", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5122B7MF89L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Fahrenheit 451 [VHS]"}
{"description": "This splatter flick, along with John Carpenter'sHalloween, helped spawn the great horror-movie movement of the '80s, not to mentioneightsequels, many of which had nothing to do with the films that preceded them. It also gave birth to Jason Voorhees, one of the three biggest horror-movie psychos of the modern era (the other two beingHalloween's Michael Myers andA Nightmare on Elm Street's Freddy Krueger). Forever duplicated, the originalFriday the 13thpopularized a number of themes and techniques that today are now clich&eacute;s: the increasingly gory murders, the remote forest location, the anonymous and nubile cast, the murderer as cult hero, and, of course, the moral that if you have sex, you will die, very painfully. Still, if you have to see aFriday the 13thmovie, this is the one to check out. A group of eager (and horny) teenagers decide to reopen Camp Crystal Lake, which 20 years earlier was closed after the shocking and mysterious murders of two amorous camp counselors. You can take it from there, as the teens get picked off one by one, during a dark and stormy night; of course, their car won't start and there's no phone. The ending stole shamelessly from Brian De Palma'sCarrie, but it still provides a slight if campy shock. Look for a young Kevin Bacon as the requisite stud--you can tell that's what he is because when the cast appears in swimsuits, he's wearing a Speedo--who's the beneficiary of the film's best murder sequence, an arrowhead to the throat. Right after having sex, of course.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300214192", "6300214311", "6300189015", "6300214605", "B00023NRSM", "6301589025", "6301094352", "6300218058", "6302921058", "6305095566", "630428845X", "6300214656", "6300267881", "0792839234", "6304288433", "B00000JQTO", "6304136242", "0780627032", "6302038308", "6302975832", "0792846311", "6303917283", "6301562925", "0784011923", "0790705141", "B000AMW2TK", "B00005B238", "0783216084", "0764005693", "B0013D8LAE", "6304509154", "630130053X", "B000VKL6Z2", "630196666X", "6303396585", "B00IF8Q0YE", "6303579388", "6300182878", "6303265715", "6304983794", "6300214176", "6302180015", "6304361025", "6304509146", "6300262855", "B00008HCCJ", "0792836634", "6302516919", "6300146383", "6303257879", "B0000039A6", "6303265693", "B009CSVQOU", "B00000JQTR", "6300147630", "6301574117", "0783235607", "6300214672", "6300213714", "6304370458", "630026999X", "6305363668", "6303257674", "6301427076", "6302798450", "6304910010", "6305814694", "6300262731", "0792835018", "6301024443", "0792110285", "6300268993", "6304508611", "B0000VCZMU", "6300182975", "6304113404", "1558807381", "6303920098", "6300182339", "B00000IQUT", "B00004RNAC", "6300185249", "6300987744", "0792845684", "6300183181", "B00000F0I2", "6302797632", "0792846303", "0792839242", "B0009A2PQI", "6300181642", "0764006770", "0792836677", "B00004WLXE"], "also_viewed": ["6302921058", "6300214192", "6300214311", "B00023NRSM", "6300214605", "6300214656", "6301094352", "6301589025", "0780627032", "6304288433", "6300218058", "6300189015", "B00AZ7V0W0", "B0002JP572", "630428845X", "6305095566", "0792839234", "B00DEQQK8S", "0792836634", "6303824382", "0767817664", "B00078XGO2", "6300182878", "6303265693", "B000RIWAVW", "0792116887", "B000VKL6Z2", "6304508611", "B002YICNE2", "6301562925", "B00ETHN9L2", "B00AEFY22I", "0451150899", "6301792734", "B00GHH9IIA", "6304509154", "B000FS9FE4", "B00AQJ8MLY", "B005CM1IES", "6301794982", "6301708695", "6300267881", "B00008HCCJ", "6300181278", "6303422020", "6304983794", "0783235607", "6300214176", "6303579388", "6305399409", "B00005B6ND", "6304240562", "6302814359", "630274461X", "B00D7AM71A", "0792839242", "6301589955"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 232095}, "asin": "6300214087", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71PWYF6B3GL._SY300_.gif", "title": "Friday the 13th 1 [VHS]"}

If you've seen even one of the overblownAirportmovies then you know the plot: the crew of a filled-to-capacity jetliner is wiped out and it's up to a plucky stewardess and a shell-shocked fighter pilot to land the plane. Robert Hays and Julie Hagerty are the heroes who have a history that includes a meet-cute &agrave; laSaturday Night Fever, a surf scene right out ofFrom Here to Eternity, a Peace Corps trip to Africa to teach the natives the benefits of Tupperware and basketball, a war-ravaged recovery room with a G.I. who thinks he's Ethel Merman (a hilarious cameo)--and those are just the flashbacks! The jokes gleefully skirt the boundaries of bad taste (pilot Peter Graves to a juvenile cockpit visitor: \"Joey, have you ever seen a grown man naked?\"), with the high (low?) point being Hagerty's intimate involvement with the blow-up automatic pilot doll, but they'll have you rolling on the floor. The film launched the careers of collaborators Jim Abrahams (Big Business), David Zucker (Ruthless People), and Jerry Zucker (Ghost), as well as revitalized such B-movie actors as Lloyd Bridges, Peter Graves, Robert Stack, and Leslie Nielsen, who built a second career on films like this.

Rock Hudson (as wonderfully wooden as ever) and Lauren Bacall play stalwart examples of altruism, clean living, and good old American ambition, but Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone steal the film as white trash millionaire siblings stewing in self-pity. The plot reads like an episode ofDallas: Texas oil-baron playboy Stack steals good girl Bacall from best friend Hudson while Stack's sister Malone puts her slinky moves on Hudson, the strapping poor boy made good. Toss in impotence, jealousy, alcoholic binges, emotional blackmail, and backstabbing nastiness, mix vigorously with high style and expressionist flourishes, and you've got the most potent melodrama cocktail of the 1950s. Stack twists his arch delivery into the practiced bravado of a boozing womanizer nursing an inferiority complex while Malone sashays and flirts her way through an Oscar-winning performance as a slutty, sassy good-time girl. It's so over the top that it might seem kitschy at first glance, but former theater director Sirk subtly shades his vision in the shadows of film noir and uses the portentous angles and gaudy color to create a vivid, vivacious world of glossy surfaces and social masks cracking under the pressure of responsibility and the pain of lost love.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783215096", "6300183890", "B006VRRGOO", "B000HA4WSO", "B0009ML2KQ", "B000ION7AI", "6304239149", "6301706587", "6303364772", "1572520922", "6301973410", "6301975987", "6301977084", "6300215741", "6300269795", "6301973313", "6302278929", "6302000661", "630197333X", "630150528X", "0800100832", "B000BWIZRW", "B002TOL49Q", "630310245X"], "bought_together": ["0783215096", "6300183890"], "also_viewed": ["B00514JKKG", "B001ILTUL0", "B000JJRBFY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 291274}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.59, "brand": "", "asin": "6301045750", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515JMNXTQML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Written on the Wind [VHS]"}

The straightforward, unsentimental, gutsyEnfantsfinds its 12-year-old protagonist, Julien Quentin, sheltered from the conflict in a Catholic school. His classmate Jean, a new arrival, becomes first a competitor, then a beloved friend. Jean, however, hides a secret from his classmates and the Gestapo; evenly, subtly, Malle creates an atmosphere of hovering and inescapable danger. It won't take you more than a few frames to guess Jean's \"secret,\" and many of the plot points here are too telescoped. Nevertheless, the plainspoken courage with which Malle tells his story remains wholly engrossing. The cinematography here is masterful and drunk with childlike wonder, alternating claustrophobic, wood-paneled church interiors with vivid, occasionally frightening outdoor vistas. And never is it more affecting than in the chilling scene where Justin gets lost in the woods during a seemingly innocent game of capture-the-treasure; trees and rocks flash by the running boy with an austere, impersonal beauty.

Sam Jaffe takes up the rear guard in turban, loin, and full-body make-up as the titular Gunga Din, the loyal water carrier who dreams of becoming a soldier.

{"description": "Seven years after he earned his first screen credit as the writer ofFast Times at Ridgemont High, formerRolling Stonewriter Cameron Crowe made his directorial debut with this acclaimed romantic comedy starring John Cusack and Ione Skye as unlikely lovers on the cusp of adulthood. The casting is perfect, and Crowe's rookie direction is appropriately unobtrusive, no doubt influenced by his actor-loving, Oscar&reg;-winning mentor, James L. Brooks. But the real strength of Crowe's work is his exceptional writing, his timely grasp of contemporary rhythms and language (he's frequently called \"the voice of a generation\"), and the rich humor and depth of his fully developed characters. InSay Anything...Cusack and Skye play recent high school graduates enjoying one final summer before leaping into a lifetime of adult responsibilities. Lloyd (Cusack) is an aspiring kickboxer with no definite plans; Diane (Skye) is a valedictorian with intentions to further her education in Europe. Together they find unlikely bliss, but there's also turbulence when Diane's father (John Mahoney)--who only wants what's best for his daughter--is charged with fraud and tax evasion. Favoring strong performances over obtrusive visual style, Crowe focuses on his unique characters and the ambitions and fears that define them; the movie's a treasure trove of quiet, often humorous revelations of personality. Lili Taylor and Eric Stoltz score high marks for memorable supporting roles, and Cusack's own sister Joan is perfect in scenes with her onscreen and offscreen brother. A rare romantic comedy that's as funny as it is dramatically honest,Say Anything...marked the arrival of a gifted writer-director who followed up with the underratedSinglesbefore scoring his first box-office smash withJerry Maguire.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300147940", "630018403X", "B000051S41", "6300183467", "6300263673", "6300214370", "0792837207", "6300184269", "6300214753", "B000068MFS", "6300214710"], "bought_together": ["6300147940"], "also_viewed": ["0800109481", "6300213986", "6300214710", "B001AEF6BI", "6300183467", "0790740222", "0767825411", "6300270033"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 257141}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6301412761", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41V8JBQ2E7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Say Anything [VHS]"}
{"description": "Maggie Smith is so witty and commanding in this film, you might forget that the script paints Jean Brodie as an ultimately self-deluding spinster. Dame Maggie won the first of her two Oscars for playing a teacher in 1930s Edinburgh more in thrall to her romantic notions of art and beauty than the real world, a cultivator of worshipping \"Brodie Girls.\" (She exalts the Mona Lisa and Mussolini with equal fervor.) Smith's expert playing makes many of the brogue-heavy Brodie-isms worth memorizing (\"She seeks to intimidate me by the use of quarter-hours.\") and raises the picture above its generally theatrical style. Real-life husband Robert Stephens plays Jean's married lover, Celia Johnson excels as the hostile headmistress, and Pamela Franklin is the deadpan whistle-blower within Miss Brodie's coven.

Slick, mechanistic, and absurd, the film is all surface action and attitude (not to mention Scott's incredibly busy, trademark art direction); and one can get lost in the sheer indulgence of it.

{"description": "This 1963 extravaganza, directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz, is certainly an epic historical drama with all the elements: elaborate sets, intricate costuming, name actors, a factual basis, and an overlong script (just over four hours). But the acting is well performed and the backdrops are lush, making this a film worth seeing. Elizabeth Taylor is Cleopatra, the Egyptian queen who seduces Julius Caesar (Rex Harrison) in a political move to hold onto her empire. When Caesar is killed in the Roman Senate, Cleopatra looks to Marc Antony (Richard Burton) for his support, practically enslaving him with her wiles. Taylor is dramatic in her role, at times overly serious, but stunning nonetheless as the woman described as \"well versed in the natural sciences and mathematics. She speaks seven languages proficiently. Were she not a woman one would consider her to be an intellectual.\" While the film does seem to drag at moments, it deserves the four Oscars it won for cinematography, art direction-set direction, costumes, and special effects.

{"description": "Robert Aldrich's tense, 1965 drama about a plane crash in the Sahara is a unique psychological study of men in desperate circumstances. In this somewhat revisionist view of classic heroism, every character within the mixed lot is stretched to his limit, and individual efforts to brave the elements and hostile nomads are duly punished.

In revealing much of what Kubrick deliberately left unexplained,2010lacks the enigmatic awe of its predecessor, but it's still a riveting tale of space exploration and extraterrestrial contact, beginning when a joint American-Soviet mission embarks to determine the cause of failure of the derelict spaceshipDiscovery.  Having arrived atDiscoverynear the planet Jupiter, the American mission leader (Roy Scheider) and his Russian counterpart (Helen Mirren) must investigate the apparent failure of the ship's infamous onboard computer, HAL 9000, as well as the meaning of countless mysterious black monoliths amassing on Jupiter's surface (an interpretation Kubrick originally left up to his viewers).

Having triumphed with 1952'sThe Bad and the Beautiful, Douglas, producer John Houseman, and director Vincente Minnelli brought vigor and vitality to this blessed project, which centers on Van Gogh's stormy friendship with fellow artist Gaugin (Oscar-winner Anthony Quinn). Minnelli used an outmoded color film process and innovative camera techniques to vividly recreate Van Gogh's paintings, and he filmed on the actual Dutch and French locations where Van Gogh's mastery flourished. The artist's lust for life also fed his madness, and this film deeply understands the fine line in between.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0452262496", "6301628667", "6301628616", "B000056BRF", "6303037380", "630266232X"], "bought_together": ["0452262496"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 216652}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6301971191", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51YCP9MZK5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Lust for Life [VHS]"}

You have to admit, it sounds intriguing, right?Mr. Brooksis the vehicle for this unsavory story, and it turns out to be a lot less kicky than it sounds. Mr. Brooks is a Portland, Oregon tycoon and philanthropist whose \"addiction\" to murder is suddenly re-surfacing--with plenty of help from his sneering alter ego, who generally sits in the back of the car, goading Mr. Brooks on. (The other characters can't see William Hurt in all this, of course.) The unbelievably convoluted plot has Mr. Brooks confronted by a blackmailer (comedian Dane Cook) who has a surprising twist on things, and trailed by a cop (Demi Moore) who comes equipped with her own set of professional and marital woes. As if that weren't enough, when Brooks's daughter (Danielle Panabaker) comes home, it becomes clear that some traits run in the family.The scenes with Costner and Hurt are the best stuff in the film, even if director Bruce Evans can't figure out how to play fair visualizing their presence to others. But the script, which among other whoppers make Demi Moore's character a millionaire, is just too unbelievable to stomach.

The truth is, nobody has ever made anything approaching its phantasmagoric, overheated style in which German expressionism, religious hysteria, fairy-tale fantasy (of the Grimm-est variety), and stalker movie are brought together in a furious boil.

So dramatic, primal, and unforgettable are its images--the preacher's shadow looming over the children in their bedroom, the magical boat ride down a river whose banks teem with fantastic wildlife, those tattoos of LOVE and HATE on the unholy man's knuckles, the golden locks of a drowned woman waving in the current along with the indigenous plant life in her watery grave--that they're still haunting audiences (and filmmakers) today.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["1558808590", "6301976126", "0784011451", "0792101448", "6304212151", "1558807780", "B000003NDA", "6301966430", "6301491920", "B00000F6MH", "6304366035", "6302226899", "0790743159", "6302413435", "6301586026", "0790741431", "6300208133", "6304429274", "0783217528", "6301797906", "6301798732", "0800100832", "B000GX7MMA", "B000054OW2", "6301977815", "B000056BRF", "B0000048YO", "B001E419N8", "630266232X", "6301978110", "6302968100", "6305237115", "6301564456", "0782008348", "0792115449", "6302353785", "6301964012", "630150528X"], "bought_together": ["1558808590"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 201324}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 18.88, "brand": "", "asin": "6301973232", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/717SP3TYNML._SY300_.gif", "title": "Night of the Hunter [VHS]"}

Bored and stifled in her life, she decides on a walk on the wild side; absconding with their 4-year-old son, she falls in with gangsters and takes a nosedive. Soon she's living the life of a slattern, hooked on cocaine and bootleg liquor, neglecting her son like he's so much excess baggage. Meanwhile her husband and friends are frantic to get the little boy back and set things right again. In this movie's 64-minute running time, director Mervyn LeRoy managed to include Depression-era social commentary, drugs, crime, sex, violence, and some surprisingly well-fleshed-out characterizations. The young Bette Davis is beautiful (even playing one scene in her lingerie), and Blondell and Dvorak are both great in their roles. Even more remarkable, though, is the number of future stars that can be spotted inThree on a Match: Lyle Talbot, a young Anne Shirley, Edward Arnold, and Humphrey Bogart in a great role as a menacing hood. This is entertaining fare that's still potent today in all its pre-censorship seediness.--Jerry Renshaw", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301973291", "6302011027", "6302375819", "6302548411", "6304359721", "6302548403", "B000MTEFW8", "B001KY8JHG", "B00242KDEK", "630160086X", "6304056958", "B006WQUL64", "B00114XLR8", "630259328X", "6302004446", "B0026ZQIFS", "B00269OW66"], "bought_together": ["6301973291"], "also_viewed": ["B000YRY7VC", "B00007ELDZ", "B000I2JDF8", "B00C68SHOK", "B001QFFBAM", "B001OSC4G0", "B008JEJSH0", "B00936A22S"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 343325}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 29.5, "brand": "", "asin": "6302041104", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/212PVDT605L.jpg", "title": "Three on a Match [VHS]"}
{"description": "James Mason plays Professor Oliver Lindenbrook, a scientist hoping to find the world's core in this 1959 adaptation of the Jules Verne novel. He leads his unusual party on an expedition to the center of the earth, by way of a volcano in Iceland. On the way, they encounter enormous mushrooms and giant prehistoric monsters. Produced by Michael Todd with then-spectacular special effects, the story was modernized to 1950s sensibilities. Mason gives this class, while Arlene Dahl and Diane Baker are the romantic interests.

Gene Hackman's Popeye Doyle, a brutally pushy New York City narcotics detective, is a dauntless crime fighter and Vietnam-era \"pig,\" a reckless vulgarian whose antics get innocent people killed. Loosely based upon an actual investigation that led to what was then the biggest heroin seizure in U.S. history, the picture traces the efforts of Doyle and his partner (Roy Scheider) to close the pipeline pumping Middle Eastern smack into the States through the French port of Marseilles. (The actual French Connection cops, Eddie Egan and Sonny Grosso, make cameo appearances.) It was widely recognized at the time that Friedkin had lifted a lot of his high-strung technique from the Costa-Gavras thrillersThe Sleeping Car MurdersandZ--he even imported one of Costa-Gavras's favorite thugs, Marcel Bozzuffi, to play the Euro-trash hit man plugged by Doyle in an elevated train station. There was an impressive official sequel in 1975,French Connection II, directed by John Frankenheimer, which took Popeye to the south of France and got him hooked on horse. A couple of semi-official spinoffs followed,The Seven-Ups, which elevated Scheider to the leading role, andBadge 373, with Robert Duvall stepping in as the pugnacious flatfoot.--David Chute", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000003KDG", "6300214567", "6300216500", "0790738139", "6305261296", "630442972X", "630407185X", "0790734079", "0790733897", "0790743531", "1558807780", "630321245X", "6300247384", "6301965701", "0792837916", "0800100832", "6304429274", "6300181340", "6300213900", "6302799163", "6303212263", "6302909023", "B00008R9K9", "B000007PI9", "0766202771", "B00005A1VH"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 82875}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6302238331", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51K7T6QP3QL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The French Connection [VHS]"}

John Turturro (Miller's Crossing,Jungle Fever) plays the title character, a pretentious left-wing writer from New York City who is brought to 1930s Hollywood to write a script for a wrestling movie for palooka actor Wallace Beery. Fink thinks the job is beneath him, but his desire for acceptance gets the better of him, and he suddenly finds himself holed up in a fleabag hotel in Los Angeles, where he is almost immediately afflicted with writer's block. Various distractions begin to enter his life, first in the form of a famous southern writer (John Mahoney) whom Fink idolizes, and then his neighbor in the hotel, a seemingly amiable salesman played by John Goodman (Sea of Love,Raising Arizona). The writer turns out to be a self-loathing drunk whose secretary (Judy Davis) is the one actually doing the writing. And the neighbor, the working-class hero who Fink made his reputation writing about, may have a horrifying secret of his own.

{"description": "When Christopher Lee declined to reprise his role as Count Dracula in a sequel to the enormously popularThe Horror of Dracula, Hammer went another direction and instead followed the investigations of vampire hunter Van Helsing (Peter Cushing). He doesn't actually appear until the second act, after French schoolteacher Marianne (Yvonne Monlaur, a big eyed, thick-lipped, curvy young beauty in the Bardot mold) inadvertently releases Baron Meinster (David Peel), a young disciple of Dracula, from his castle prison in a cursed mountain village. This handsome vampire bites his way through a bevy of glamorous beauties in low-cut blouses and frilly nightgowns as he woos his sexy savior, while Van Helsing relentlessly tracks him back to Marianne. Director Terence Fisher, working from a rather convoluted (and at times incomprehensible) script, makes his mark  through a series of marvelous set pieces. In one of the most memorable, a twisted old woman plays midwife to a reborn undead, coaxing her out of the ground as hands push through the earth. In one harrowing moment Van Helsing sears his neck with a branding iron and treats it with holy water after being bitten. Cushing is his usual dashing self, more than making up for the handsome but hardly commanding Peel, and you might recognize Marita Hunt, who plays the withered Baroness, as Miss Haversham from David Lean's classicGreat Expectations.--Sean Axmaker", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 279896}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "title": "Brides of Dracula [VHS]", "related": {"also_bought": ["B006TTC5J0", "B000095J42", "6303149189", "1564427099", "630281474X", "6303626475", "6305063508", "B0001FVE9K", "0790736098"], "also_viewed": ["B0009X770O", "B00B94VJYW", "B00BPX7K5Y", "B003M8NGG2", "B000095J42", "B001B9ZVVC", "B00005NSXY", "B00C7ZBU6E", "B000U1ZV7G", "B00005LC4J", "B008HSK3PE", "B00000F62P", "155526509X", "B001YZU32A", "B00005KHJP"]}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514QBQN54BL._SY300_.jpg", "asin": "6302503507"}
{"description": "Though it wasn't Hammer Studios' final film,Frankenstein and the Monster from Hellcan be considered its swan song, an intelligent, inventive, stylized reworking of the themes that had sustained the series for almost two decades. Dr.&nbsp;Frankenstein has buried his old identity and reigns over an insane asylum as Dr.&nbsp;Victor (Peter Cushing under a flamboyant blond wig in his sixth and final turn as the mad scientist) as if it were a live-parts yard for his continuing experiments. With the help of an ambitious acolyte he builds his latest creature, a hirsute apelike brute stitched together from the asylum's most promising inhabitants and turned into a sad, tortured slave. The film was shot at the end of Hammer's glory days, and the budgetary constraints can be seen in unconvincing miniatures and the rather bulky and stiff ogre suit, but the dark, claustrophobic sets create an effectively gloomy atmosphere. Director Terence Fisher effectively pulls out all stops for a marvelous sequence of the creature digging through the asylum graveyard in the middle of a flashing electrical storm, a demonic twist on the iconic gravedigging images that go all the way back to the 1931Frankenstein. This was the last reunion for Cushing and Fisher, who together gave birth to Hammer's gothic reign withThe Curse of FrankensteinandHorror of Dracula. Fisher retired after finishing the film.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302814669", "6303149189", "0792846761", "6302843227", "630252542X", "6300181820", "6300185443", "6302884713", "6300183084", "6302843219", "0792845552"], "bought_together": ["6302814669"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 356145}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 29.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6302491975", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Y0KF0QVDL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Frankenstein &amp; The Monster From Hell [VHS]"}

{"description": "Hammer Studios' greatest nemeses, Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee, once again square off in this reworking of Universal'sThe Mummy(with elements ofThe Mummy's TombandThe Mummy's Ghostthrown in for good measure). Cushing stars as archeologist John Banning, whose dig for a lost tomb results in untold treasures but leaves his father a mumbling madman and marks the rest of the company for death. Lee is Kharis, a former high priest turned gauze-wrapped guardian of the tomb, a veritable Golem sent on a mission of vengeance by Mehemet Bey (George Pastell), a disciple of the ancient Egyptian god Osiris. The scenes at the archeological dig and the flashbacks to the ancient burial are stagebound and cheap looking, but Terence Fisher is back in familiar territory when the action relocates to the misty swamps and Victorian mansions of rural England. The towering, 6-foot-3-inch-tall Lee makes the most terrifying mummy to date. He covers ground in giant strides, smashes his way into rooms with heavy Frankensteinlike swipes of his arm, and takes shotgun blasts with barely a twitch--yet he melts from rage to calm at the sight of Banning's wife, Isobel (Yvonne Furneaux), a dead ringer for his dead Queen.

Loosely based on the true crimes of Ed Gein (also a partial inspiration forPsycho), the original Jeffrey Dahmer,Texas Chainsaw Massacrefollows a group of teenagers who pick up a hitchhiker and wind up in a backwoods horror chamber where they're held captive, tortured, chopped up, and impaled on meat hooks by a demented cannibalistic family, including a character known as Leatherface who maniacally wields one helluva chainsaw. The movie's powerful sense of dread is heightened by its grainy, semi-documentary style--but it also has a wicked sense of humor (and not that camp, self-referential variety that became so tiresome in subsequent horror films of the '70s, '80s, and '90s).

Of course, a thunderstorm accelerates everything.  It's up to the townspeople to stop the advance of the menace before it overruns everything.  Based on a story by Jack Arnold (director ofCreature from the Black Lagoon),Monolith's production values are very good for the time, with the huge, menacing black rocks  sometimes resembling the Chrysler Building.

Kurosawa traces the evolution of a deep and abiding bond between the two men, one civilized in the usual sense, the other at home in the sub-zero Siberian woods. There's no question thatDersu Uzala(the film is named for the Goldi character, played by Maxim Munzuk) has the muscular, imaginative look of a large-canvas Soviet Mosfilm from the 1970s.

{"description": "Richard Donner's 1978 epic about the Man of Steel showed how a film about a superhero could be a moving and romantic experience even for people who long ago gave up comic books. Beginning on the icy planet Krypton, the story follows the baby Kal-El, whose rocket ship lands in Smallville, Kansas.

Macy, Anthony LaPaglia, Ossie Davis, and Brad Renfro--goes a long way toward makingThe Clientone of the more solidly enjoyable screen adaptations of a John Grisham southern gothic legal thriller. Teen-hearthrob Renfro is a natural, playing a kid whose life is in jeopardy after he witnesses the death of a Mob lawyer. Susan Sarandon is the attorney who decides to look after the boy; nobody can match her when it comes to playing strong and protective maternal figures (Thelma and Louise,Lorenzo's Oil,Dead Man Walking). Sarandon won her fourth Oscar nomination as best actress for this role, before finally winning the following year forDead Man Walking. Author Grisham was so impressed with former window dresser/fashion designer/screenwriter-turned-director Joel Schumacher's work on this movie that he later asked him to directA Time to Kill.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["6304259131", "6302935148", "0790748169", "0800125762", "0792116887", "6302816629", "6305718792", "B00003CXFU", "6300214567", "0792147618", "B000007OY0", "6305171750", "0792133153", "6303402348", "6302415853", "6304358520", "6303398480", "B00000F5PI", "B00020HABA", "B00003CXTF", "B00000IO4G", "6304925131", "B00006RCSC", "079212569X", "B00003CXE6", "B000062XM6", "6302989787", "6301734734", "0783222955", "B00005JKIO", "0790740249", "6303313345", "6303383300", "6302479487", "6302945089", "6303696813", "0790731274", "0783223218", "6304458975", "0800199421", "B00007CVYA", "6301578805", "6300147355", "6302909023", "6302282535", "B0002GTWOM", "6300248089", "B00003CXN3", "6304214502", "0780616456", "6304078250", "630233683X", "076783819X", "6303100864", "6304826133", "630300394X", "0783204914", "0790701251", "6301208773", "6301888901", "6301071379", "B00006CXKM"], "bought_together": ["6304259131", "6302935148"], "also_viewed": ["6304259131"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 233204}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.44, "brand": "", "asin": "6303269834", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41RSMZESJ1L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Client [VHS]"}
{"description": "Boaz Yakin's astounding debut feature looks at the violent world of the projects through the eyes of a 12-year-old drug runner. Sean Nelson delivers a quiet but intense performance as Michael--street name Fresh--a cynical but introspective kid grown up fast and hard on the killing streets of the projects. Samuel L. Jackson costars as Fresh's estranged father, a speed chess hustler in the city park whose dispassionate philosophy--the chess board as life--becomes the film's central metaphor, as Fresh plots a brilliant, coldly brutal plan to save himself and his junkie sister from his world of drug dealers and street violence. Yakin's assured direction delivers a vividly realized world in bold, crisp images and an austere but poetic style that captures the dispassionate point of view of a heart-hardened adolescent street survivor. The excellent score by former Police-man  Stewart Copeland, his most haunting sinceRumblefish, mixes smooth symphonic sounds with bluesy guitars and syncopated percussion, giving the soundtrack the same sad intimacy as Yakin's visuals. The world of Fresh is alive with danger that  threatens to extinguish all the wonder and joy of childhood--the film's most devastating moment observes Fresh helplessly trying to stop the bleeding of a schoolmate, a girl he has a crush on, caught by a stray bullet from a senseless playground murder. As Fresh loses his innocence playing street thugs and drug dealers like pieces on a chess board, he becomes the greatest victim of all.--Sean Axmaker", "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 484032}, "asin": "6303354912", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Y7J3SPECL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Fresh [VHS]"}

Catherine is engaged to pretentious James Moreland (the oh-so-appropriate English actor and writer Stephen Fry). Catherine's early 1950s world is all bookish and brainy, even though she has aspirations toward the romantic (Moreland's idea of a honeymoon is the Belgian Congo with Pygmies; she longs for Hawaii). Einstein and his professor pals, played by Lou Jacobi, Gene Saks, and Joseph Maher, conspire to match their beloved Catherine with the sincere and smart (though not intellectual) Ed.This is a sweet--but not saccharine--story about \"engineering\" the course of true love and the ironic triumph of heart over head.

The jokes, like the characters, are intentionally recycled, self-conscious comic fodder from a baby-boomer's lifetime (such as Gale's or Zemeckis's) of immersion in pop culture.

{"description": "There were only two ways for \"classicTrek\" cast members to appear in a movie with the cast ofStar Trek: The Next Generation: either Capt. Kirk and his contemporaries would have to be very, very old, or there would be some time travel involved in the plot. Since geriatric heroes aren't very exciting (despite a welcomed cameo appearance by the aged Dr. McCoy),Star Trek: Generationsunites Capt. Kirk (William Shatner) and Capt. Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) in a time-jumping race to stop a madman's quest for heavenly contentment. When a mysterious energy coil called the Nexus nearly destroys the newly christened U.S.S.Enterprise-B, the just-retired Capt. Kirk is lost and presumed dead. But he's actually been happily trapped in the timeless purgatory of the Nexus--an idyllic state of being described by the mystical Guinan (Whoopi Goldberg) as \"pure joy.\" Picard must convince Kirk to leave this artificial comfort zone and confront Dr. Soran (Malcolm McDowell), the madman who will threaten billions of lives to be reunited with the addictive pleasure of the Nexus. With subplots involving the android Data's unpredictable \"emotion chip\" and the spectacular crash-landing of the starshipEnterprise, this crossover movie not only satisfiedTrekfans, but it also gave them something they'd never had to confront before: the heroic and truly final death of a belovedStar Trekcharacter.

A ramshackle comedy set in a mall, the film follows several story lines involving lovers, enemies, friends, goofballs, and Smith's own \"silent\" character, who also appeared inClerksandChasing Amy. A heavy self-consciousness weighs on everything, as if Smith forgot how to make obscenity funny instead of tedious. Still, it's nice to see some of the director's film family on screen, among them Jason Lee and Joey Lauren Adams.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303430570", "6304681526"], "bought_together": ["6304681526"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 382168}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6303964745", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/519THV44M1L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Mallrats [VHS]"}
{"description": "Hollywood's legendary \"woman's director,\" George Cukor (The Women,The Philadelphia Story), transformed Audrey Hepburn into street-urchin-turned-proper-lady Eliza Doolittle in this film version of the Lerner and Loewe musical. Based on George Bernard Shaw's playPygmalion,My Fair Ladystars Rex Harrison as linguist Henry Higgins (Harrison also played the role, opposite Julie Andrews, on stage), who draws Eliza into a social experiment that works almost too well. The letterbox edition of this film on video certainly pays tribute to the pageantry of Cukor's set, but it also underscores a certain visual stiffness that can slow viewer enthusiasm just a tad. But it's really star wattage that keeps this film exciting, that and such great songs as \"On the Street Where You Live\" and \"I Could Have Danced All Night.\" Actor Jeremy Brett, who gained a huge following later in life portraying Sherlock Holmes, is quite electric as Eliza's determined suitor.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["6304117752", "630233683X", "B00000F6D1", "6305282927", "6303494390", "6305123616", "6304151306", "6303444202", "630197736X", "6300246787", "6300215814", "630150528X", "B00000JS61", "6304400551", "B00004TRD5", "0790744759", "0792837533", "B00000I1EM", "0792839846", "6304331851", "6303854311", "B0000048YM", "6302363268", "6303215734", "0792840836", "0792151712", "6300207919", "B00AMEZDK6", "6300215695", "B00005JL1P", "6301586026", "6305750750", "6301390725", "6303314015", "0792837614", "6300215717", "0788806270", "B000URDCC6", "6302820448", "B0045HCJJY", "0788802194", "B00005LL26", "6304504012", "0783222955", "6302526574", "B00004WZQ2", "B0000633ZP", "6302799139", "B00004TZS4", "6300181529", "6300270351", "B000GFK81K", "B00AEFY5TI", "B0002YLCG0", "B0000VCZKM", "6300251152", "0792837630", "6300215598", "6300181456", "6303631851", "B00000491O", "6301797957", "B00005JLIU", "6304044836", "B004A7XXJO", "0790741091", "6301969251", "630344394X", "0783241569", "B002M2Z3BA", "B00004RV8M", "6302878527", "6300216233", "0790751216", "6303562248", "078061755X", "630197154X", "B00005A1VG", "6302208920", "0792840844", "6300215776", "0790758474", "6302797667", "B0001E7LQG", "6303965415", "6303675212", "B00003CXFU", "6302610699", "6302299497", "6302800854", "0788811355", "6300247139"], "bought_together": ["6304117752"], "also_viewed": ["B005NFJAZS", "6304117752", "B00BTYU3ZS", "630233683X", "6305282927", "6305123616", "B000HT3PGU", "B000MV9O4U", "B0045HCJJY", "B0090XLDKY", "6303494390", "B000087EYD", "B00000F6D1", "6300274268", "B00AATV0WS", "B0006V6TO4", "6300215717", "0788802194", "6304151306", "B00005JL1P", "6304539274", "0792839129", "B001XVZURI", "6300213803", "B000035Z2S", "B00000JS61", "155890641X", "6300263673", "5559477621", "6304331851", "0792839846", "B001PO54V0", "B003VS0CX8", "6301792769", "B0000AM6IY", "6305320802", "0792151712", "B000HT3PGK", "B0045HCJQM", "6304400225", "6300181529", "B006TTC5WC", "0788805843", "B00AEFXMGU", "6303824358", "6304539258", "B00005LL26", "B007P7UF0G", "6300215695", "630197736X", "076781326X", "6303109918", "6302484359", "0792837630", "6302363268", "6304022492", "B001E4TDR2", "B00004R99N", "080013558X"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 50217}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6304178352", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51SX55C3JDL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "My Fair Lady (digitally THX mastered) [VHS]"}

{"description": "A flashy, splashy summer-movie blockbuster that's fun and exciting without being mindless? That's the impossible mission accomplished by director Brian De Palma, star-coproducer Tom Cruise, and the crack team ofMission: Impossible. Based on the '60s TV show and an almost impenetrably complex (but nonetheless thrilling) original story by David Koepp (Jurassic Park) and Steven Zaillian (Schindler's List), with a screenplay by Koepp and Robert Towne (Chinatown,Shampoo),Mission: Impossiblebegins with veteran agent Jim Phelps (Jon Voight) and his expert crew embarking on a mission that goes horribly, horribly wrong. But nothing is what it seems. The nail-biting set piece--always a signature of director De Palma (Carrie,The Untouchables)--in which Cruise is lowered from the ceiling to retrieve information from a computer in a high-security vault--is an instant classic. But perhaps even more impressive, at least in retrospect, is a flashback sequence in which two characters attempt to reconstruct a series of events from multiple points of view. It's pretty daring and sophisticated stuff for a big-budget spy movie, but brains were always what put theMission: Impossibleteam ahead of the competition, anyway, no?--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B00FZM412Q", "B0044VB3CK", "B00016UX0K", "B005XUNG5I"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 370174}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.99, "brand": "", "asin": "630420065X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41CTTDNC5EL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Mission Impossible [VHS]"}

The man who brings these warriors together is Yul Brynner, the baddest bald man in the West. There's nothing especially stylish about the approach of veteran director John Sturges (The Great Escape), but the storytelling is clear and strong, and the charisma of the young guns fairly flies off the screen. If that isn't enough to awaken the 12-year-old kid inside anyone, the unforgettable Elmer Bernstein music will do it: bum-bum-ba-bum, bum-ba-bum-ba-bum.... Followed by three inferior sequels,Return of the Seven,Guns of the Magnificent Seven, andThe Magnificent Seven Ride!--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["0784011923", "6300269639", "0767825411", "6300183181", "6303344224", "6301570723", "6302824729", "B00000490M", "6305814694", "6302091632", "6300214753", "B0000048S1", "6300216500", "6302765536", "6304932553", "0783216084", "B00000JGEI", "B00005B6ND", "6300184951", "0790731436", "B000JM6B1G", "6300182533", "6302718961", "B000003KDG", "6301966317", "0790751216", "6300269043", "0792107683", "6301976401", "0792845684", "6300213668", "6302360978", "6304071876", "6300213838", "0792838408", "6305123616", "6301827732", "6303540082", "6302374189", "6300251012", "0790731975", "6300182495", "6302909023", "6305237115", "0790738139", "0792106989", "0782008348", "6303402070", "6300214567", "B00008DZ83", "B0000BWVBD", "B00006G8LB", "0792110188", "630018403X", "6301802330", "6303651461", "B000059XY5", "6302130379", "6300215695", "6304935811", "630196733X", "6300268799", "6302032237", "6300214710", "6300215814", "6301968948", "6302309751", "B00004TYS8", "6301395395", "6303236863", "6300214370", "6300183467", "0790734079", "6304773412", "0792835077", "1558802258", "B000056BRF", "6302238331", "6304773390", "6302380588", "B000006FNX", "6301971426", "0790733897", "6304429274", "B00004WZR1", "6300216012", "6300215644", "0783235593", "0792842464", "6304039522", "630336568X", "B00004RFFA", "0800100832", "6303123244", "6300215962", "6300182452", "0792837371", "6302032261", "6301966988"], "bought_together": ["0784011923", "6300269639"], "also_viewed": ["B003DZAM8O", "0792838408"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 297275}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.94, "brand": "", "asin": "630442972X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51SRHRTAMPL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Magnificent Seven [VHS]"}
{"description": "Distractingly loose but clever, this 1987 comedy by Joe Dante (Gremlins,Matinee) stars Martin Short as a hypochondriac and Dennis Quaid as a miniaturized test pilot who is accidentally injected into him. Taking a page or two (or a hundred) from the classic science fiction movieFantastic Voyage,Innerspacedetails the adventures of traveling through the human body's complicated systems, though in this case, it proves an unusual way for two characters to forge a bond. Dante's endless imagination goes into overdrive here, but the film is more gimmick than anything else and ultimately feels a bit hollow. Fans of Short or Quaid might like it more than most, though Dante's hardcore fans will also appreciate seeing his stock players Dick Miller and Kevin McCarthy.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303122647", "6302862787", "0792158261", "B00005RIJ3", "6302662648", "0790700506", "6304155972", "076780547X", "B00000JGEK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 331633}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6304438060", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51M1EAJTCEL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Innerspace [VHS]"}
{"description": "Audrey Hepburn's last Oscar nomination was for this adaptation of Frederick Knott's famed stage thriller about a blind woman, a con man (Alan Arkin), and a doll full of heroin. Thanks to Hepburn's husband, a photographer who does a good deal of traveling, she's unknowingly come into possession of said doll, which was given to him on a plane by a comely young drug runner who winds up dead. The murderous Arkin, aided by sympathetic henchman Richard Crenna, will let nothing stand in the way of his obtaining it, even if it comes down to assaying multiple \"personalities\" in order to visit and terrorize Hepburn; Crenna is unwillingly enlisted to help. However, the \"world's champion blind lady\" (as Hepburn sardonically states) is more than up to the task of defending herself in her basement Manhattan apartment in a heart-stopping climax that to this day still defines the way horror movies with jack-in-the-box psychos are made. Despite the obvious staginess of it all (the entire action takes place in Hepburn's apartment), it still works magnificently, thanks to Hepburn's steely will and Arkin's deadly, sadistic madman. A helpful hint: turn out all the lights when you watch it; theaters back in 1967 did so, killing the guiding lights during the film's last 15 minutes. We can't tell you why, but trust us, it's worth it.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303631851", "6300215598", "6300215741", "0822212161", "6300251152", "6302878527", "0783222955", "6302241103", "6300215717", "0783235607", "6300181405", "6300181529", "B00004TRD5", "B0002IXSVI", "6305282927", "6300216721", "0783235593", "6301969316", "0790705141", "B000PYKZYC", "B00005RRG6"], "bought_together": ["0822212161"], "also_viewed": ["0783221347", "B006TTC5WC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 284024}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6304457383", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51WC3EKH3DL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Wait Until Dark [VHS]"}
{"description": "This Frank Capra comedy from 1931 helped define the screwball-comedy genre that became so popular with films likeIt Happened One NightandThe Awful Truth. In this witty romp, Jean Harlow plays an upper-crust socialite who bullies her reporter husband (Robert Williams) into conforming to her highfalutin ways. The husband chafes at the confinement of high society, though, and yearns for a creative outlet. He decides to write a play and collaborates with a fellow reporter (Loretta Young); the results are unexpectedly hilarious, especially when Young shows up at the mansion with a gaggle of boozehound reporters in tow. With snappy, ribald dialogue (allowable in those pre-Hays Code days), Capra keeps the gags flying fast and furious, taking special delight in having Williams's journalist pals rib him endlessly over his kept-man status.Platinum Blondewas a great success at the time of its release during the class-conscious Depression; for better or worse, its star Harlow was identified with the tag \"platinum blonde\" until her untimely death.--Jerry Renshaw", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301978390", "6301967615", "6302375827", "B00DDHFKW0"], "also_viewed": ["B0047BXR1C", "B005VPNJ2A", "6302605121"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 453756}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6304481756", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51BKH3M017L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Platinum Blonde [VHS]"}
{"description": "Halloweenis as pure and undiluted as its title.  In the small town of Haddonfield, Illinois, a teenage baby sitter  tries to survive a Halloween night of relentless terror, during which  a knife-wielding maniac goes after the town's hormonally charged  youths. Director John Carpenter takes this simple situation and  orchestrates a superbly mounted symphony of horrors. It's a movie much scarier for its dark spaces and ominous camera movements  than for its explicit bloodletting (which is actually minimal). Composed  by Carpenter himself, the movie's freaky music sets the tone; and his  script (cowritten with Debra Hill) is laced with references to other  horror pictures, especiallyPsycho. The baby sitter is played  by Jamie Lee Curtis, the real-life daughter ofPsychovictim  Janet Leigh; and the obsessed policeman played by Donald Pleasence  is named Sam Loomis, after John Gavin's character inPsycho.  In the end, though,Halloweenstands on its own as an  uncannily frightening experience--it's one of those movies that had  audiences literally jumping out of their seats and shouting at the  screen. (\"No! Don't drop that knife!\") Produced on a low budget,  the picture turned a monster profit, and spawned many sequels,  none of which approached the 1978 original. Curtis returned for two  more installments: 1981's dismalHalloween II, which picked  up the story the day after the unfortunate events, and 1998's occasionally  grippingHalloween H20, which proved the former baby sitter  was still haunted after 20 years.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005LC4Q", "B000FA57UI", "B000FA57US", "B000Q66Q2O", "B005CFC0N8", "B004P7CNUY", "B0000AOX09", "B004P7CM9Q", "B000VKL6Z2", "B00006LPHA", "B002XD0J80", "B00AQJ8MLY", "B001NPD9LS", "B002YICNE2", "B000GETUDI", "B000FS9FE4", "B001DJLD1W", "B00AEFY2LO", "B00006FI0R", "B00AEFY2WI", "B005CFBYW6", "B00006FDBT", "B00AEFY31S", "B00AEFY37C", "B00005K3NR", "B00004TS0G", "B003UGLCIA", "B0087ZG7UW", "B000I2J68M", "B000V4UFZK", "B0000VCZMK", "B0033B5XCS", "B000AM6OQ2", "B0002JP572", "B002VWNIDG", "B0058S0OMS", "B000099T3M", "B00AEFY1V0", "B002ZG971U", "B00AEFYYH6", "B00003CXCF", "B004LWZW2O", "B001B1UO6W", "B00006FDCD", "B000E1ZBIG", "B004SIP9MY", "B000TSIJWY", "B000WC3864", "B004AC6PMG", "B001DJLD0S", "B000QQJ3Q0", "B004P7CMT6", "B0002CHK1S", "B000FC2GA0", "B008CYDD7I", "B0008191WO", "B0024FADD8", "B0053TWVDC", "B00018D42W", "B00AEFY2AA", "B00DTPRZ24", "B000KJU1KK", "B00AEFY2E6", "B0000CEB6Y", "B0006SGYL0", "B00004Y87O", "B0013D8LAE", "B00005JA8B", "B006ZL1P66", "B000GBEWRU", "B000IMUYJM", "B005J9ZFQG", "B001JFZ1UE", "B007STBUHI", "B000E8M0P6", "6305972001", "B00079Z9WI", "B00005A8XX", "B00009PY4G", "B000FAOC2W", "B000AA4JL6", "B0002C4JJ4", "B0002O7XW2", "B008JFUNYG", "B000HEWEGC", "B002LMSWN2", "B00BM4Q4H6", "B000HCO86I", "B008874968", "0783227434", "B0006SSOHC", "B001JFZ122", "B004LWZW24", "B000Q66Q8I", "B00001QGUM", "B000OYCMLM", "B000PMLJMQ", "B00000ILDD", "B00A1AU72A", "B004SIP9E2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00KDU8HQQ", "B00005LC4Q", "B000VKL6Z2", "B002YICNE2"]}, "price": 19.96, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 349265}, "asin": "6304697961", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51NXT68J3CL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Halloween"}

{"description": "One of the greatest screen biographies ever produced, this monumental film runs nearly three hours, won seven Academy Awards, and gave George C. Scott the greatest role of his career. It was released in 1970 when protest against the Vietnam War still raged at home and abroad, and many critics and moviegoers struggled to reconcile current events with the movie's glorification of Gen. George S. Patton as a crazy-brave genius of World War II.How could a movie so huge in scope and so fascinated by its subject be considered an anti-war film? The simple truth is that it's not--Patton is less about World War II than about the rise and fall of a man whose life was literally defined by war, and who felt lost and lonely without the grand-scale pursuit of an enemy. George C. Scott embodies his role so fully, so convincingly, that we can't help but be drawn to and fascinated by Patton as a man who is simultaneously bound for hell and glory. The film's opening monologue alone is a masterful display of acting and character analysis, and everything that follows is sheer brilliance on the part of Scott and director Franklin J. Schaffner.Filmed on an epic scale at literally dozens of European locations, Patton does not embrace war as a noble pursuit, nor does it deny the reality of war as a breeding ground for heroes. Through the awesome achievement of Scott's performance and the film's grand ambition, Patton shows all the complexities of a man who accepted his role in life and (like Scott) played it to the hilt.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303057225", "0800132009", "B0007TKNGA", "6304071876", "6302909023", "6301966317", "6300181472", "B000059HGY", "6300214826", "6300268748", "079213690X", "630407185X", "B00000K3AN", "6301797906", "6301115430", "079284646X", "0790701251", "0790752395", "6302529441", "0783221347", "B00000F13T", "6300216543", "B00006C7G9", "6304151306", "B00005LL26", "630018224X", "6301971809", "6301965817", "6300181340", "630442972X", "6300988473", "630105573X", "0783216084", "6301777867", "B00003CXTF", "B000003KDG", "6303020089", "6301969251", "B000003KHS", "B00004CNR5", "6301662954", "0784011923", "B00000FZCU", "6300215962", "0800100832", "1569942072", "B00003CXE6", "6300271846", "6300181154", "630274721X", "0790734079", "0764004638", "0800125762", "6302415853", "6301976622", "630018627X", "B00005A1VG", "B000007OY0", "B000068TSI", "B00005ATQA", "0800116917", "6300216802", "6303696813", "6300267830", "0790758474", "0792116887", "0783235607", "630197154X", "B00005Q4GY", "B0000048YO", "6302224330", "0800106032", "6303824358", "B000056BRF", "6304457278", "6300267938", "6300182304"], "bought_together": ["6303057225"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 219212}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.74, "brand": "", "asin": "6304935811", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/418V1BMMHEL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Patton [VHS]"}

{"description": "After the tight plotting and quirky intensity ofFargo, this casually amusing follow-up from the prolifically inventive Coen (Ethan and Joel) brothers seems like a bit of a lark, and the result was a box-office disappointment. The good news is,The Big Lebowskiis every bit a Coen movie, and its lazy plot is part of its laidback charm. After all, how many movies can claim as their hero a pot-bellied, pot-smoking loser named Jeff \"The Dude\" Lebowski (Jeff Bridges) who spends most of his time bowling and getting stoned? And where else could you find a hairnetted Latino bowler named Jesus (John Turturro) who sports dazzling purple footgear, or an erotic artist (Julianne Moore) whose creativity consists of covering her naked body in paint, flying through the air in a leather harness, and splatting herself against a giant canvas? Who else but the Coens would think of showing you a camera view from inside the holes of a bowling ball, or an elaborate Busby Berkely-styled musical dream sequence involving a Viking goddess and giant bowling pins? The plot--which finds Lebowski involved in a kidnapping scheme after he's mistaken for a rich guy with the same name--is almost beside the point. What counts here is a steady cascade of hilarious dialogue, great work from Coen regulars John Goodman and Steve Buscemi, and the kind of cinematic ingenuity that puts the Coens in a class all their own.

{"description": "If you were to argue that Mel Brooks'sYoung Frankensteinranks among the top-ten funniest movies of all time, nobody could reasonably dispute the claim. Spoofing classic horror in the way that Brooks's previous filmBlazing Saddlessent up classic Westerns, the movie is both a loving tribute and a raucous, irreverent parody of Universal's classic horror filmsFrankenstein(1931) andBride of Frankenstein(1935). Filming in glorious black and white, Brooks re-created theFrankensteinlaboratory using the same equipment from the originalFrankenstein(courtesy of designer Kenneth Strickfaden), and this loving attention to physical and stylistic detail creates a solid foundation for nonstop comedy. The story, of course, involves Frederick Frankenstein (Gene Wilder) and his effort to resume experiments in re-animation pioneered by his late father. (He's got some help, since dad left behind a book titledHow I Did It.) Assisting him is the hapless hunchback Igor (Marty Feldman) and the buxom but none-too-bright maiden Inga (Teri Garr), and when Frankenstein succeeds in creating his monster (Peter Boyle), the stage is set for an outrageous revision of the Frankenstein legend. With comedy highlights too numerous to mention, Brooks guides his brilliant cast (also including Cloris Leachman, Madeline Kahn, Kenneth Mars, and Gene Hackman in a classic cameo role) through scene after scene of inspired hilarity. Indeed,Young Frankensteinis a charmed film, nothing less than a comedy classic, representing the finest work from everyone involved. Not one joke has lost its payoff, and none of the countless gags have lost their zany appeal. From a career that includes some of the best comedies ever made, this is the film for which Mel Brooks will be most fondly remembered. Befitting a classic, the Special Edition DVD includes audio commentary by Mel Brooks, a \"making of\" documentary, interviews with the cast, hilarious bloopers and outtakes, and the original theatrical trailers. No video library should be without a copy ofYoung Frankenstein.

{"description": "The 1998 testosterone-saturated blow-'em-up from producer Jerry Bruckheimer and director Michael Bay (The Rock,Bad Boys) continues Hollywood's millennium-fueled fascination with the destruction of our planet. There's no arguing that the successful duo understands what mainstream American audiences want in their blockbuster movies--loads of loud, eye-popping special effects, rapid- fire pacing, and patriotic flag waving. Bay's protagonists--the eight crude, lewd, oversexed (but lovable, of course) oil drillers summoned to save the world from a Texas-sized meteor hurling toward the earth--are not flawless heroes, but common men with whom all can relate. In this huge Western-in-space soap opera, they're American cowboys turned astronauts. Sci-fi buffs will appreciate Bay's fetishizing of technology, even though it's apparent he doesn't understand it as anything more than flashing lights and shiny gadgets. Smartly, the duo also tries to lure the art-house crowd, raiding the local indie acting stable and populating the film with guys like Steve Buscemi, Billy Bob Thornton, Owen Wilson, and Michael Duncan, all adding needed touches of humor and charisma. When Bay applies his sledgehammer aesthetics to the action portions of the film, it's mindless fun; it's only whenArmageddontackles humanity that it becomes truly offensive. Not sinceMississippi Burninghave racial and cultural stereotypes been substituted for characters so blatantly--African Americans, Japanese, Chinese, Scottish, Samoans, Muslims, French ... if it's not white and American, Bay simplifies it. Or, make that whitemaleAmerica; the film features only three notable females--four if you count the meteor, who's constantly referred to as a \"bitch that needs drillin',\" but she's a hell of a lot more developed and unpredictable than the other women characters combined. Sure, Bay's film creates some tension and contains some visceral moments, but if he can't create any redeemable characters outside of those in space, what's the point of saving the planet?--Dave McCoy", "related": {"also_bought": ["6304681496", "6304233639", "0783222475", "0792845684", "B00003CXTF", "B00004WIDB", "B00000JGEN", "0792151712", "B000007OY0", "B0001DI5W6", "0783222955", "6302610702", "079213690X", "6302909023", "6300215830", "6301976622", "6301643410"], "bought_together": ["6304681496"], "also_viewed": ["6301398912", "630382790X", "6304233639", "6300214540", "6303257844", "B000003KHS", "0792151712", "B000059XYK", "0800125762", "B00005JM5E", "6302415853", "B00005PJ8I", "0783241542", "B00003CXTF"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 194393}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.38, "brand": "Touchstone Home Video", "asin": "6305169187", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515Y886RQYL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Armageddon [VHS]"}
{"description": "The true story of two English children who claimed they photographed fairies in 1917 produced two different movies in the late 1990s. Not as  well-known as the earnest family dramaFairyTale: A True Story, the English-madePhotographing Fairiestakes a much more adult angle on  the  incident. The film follows not the children, but Charles Castle (Toby Stephens), a young photographer who loses his beloved wife on their honeymoon. A shell of a man through World War&nbsp;I, Castle  rediscovers faith when he is convinced the fairy photographs have not been faked (in a superb sequence reminiscent ofBlowup). Castle makes a pilgrimage to the site where he discovers--in another vast departure from the other movie--narcotic flowers and erotic fairies that dazzle his sprit. Ben Kingsley costars as the down-to-earth preacher set to make his town right again.

{"description": "Christmas is not a good time of year in the McClane family. Especially  for John McClane, who always happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. But if it weren't for the heroics of this rugged, resourceful cop, many lives would be lost and megalomaniacal terrorists with various European accents would be having their evil way. In 1988, director John McTiernan and the phenomenal hitDie Hardintroduced the world to maverick Sgt. John McClane (Bruce Willis) of the New York Police Department, and in the course of this film and two blockbuster sequels McClane was frantically saving lives, buildings, airports, schools, cities, and even his marriage from the threat of international terrorists, psychopaths, and cagey mercenaries. Now you can watch antihero McClane blast his way through all three movies. Witness his transition from a happy-go-lucky, slightly cranky cop to extremely burnt-out, partially alcoholic cop with a propensity to attract extreme violence and catastrophe. Yet the one thing that always overshadows his character flaws is his uncanny ability to spoil the schemes of stylish villains with slick names such as Hans Gruber (the nasty terrorist from the first film, played to perfection by Alan Rickman). Sit down, pop some corn, grab a bottle of Coca-Cola, and get ready to watch (in any order you please) theDie Hard Trilogy--a must for any action buff or fan of Bruce Willis, who owes his film career to the enduring appeal of these global box-office hits.--Jeremy Storey", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000VNMMR0", "B000U1ZV8K", "B00BUAEYVK", "B002GSXKNS", "B0004Z33G4", "B000MGBLSC", "B000MGBSE4", "B001VLBDD0", "B000XT1P4S", "B00005N5S5", "B0015XHP4A", "6304711891", "6304806434", "B005COLETU", "0790729695", "B00000G3PA", "B00388PK7O", "B000MGBLTQ", "B000JYW5BE", "B00004STDN", "B0006GANOQ", "B001TK80C0", "B00003CXC5", "B004EPYZUS", "B000U1ZV62", "B001DJLD1M", "B000U1ZV4Y", "B009MF5BXK", "B005CFBYW6", "B0057RCFQS", "B0054OGQM8", "B005PTYP70", "B00000ILDH", "B00004Z4WR", "B00005JA8B", "B002ZG999U", "B00070FX5U", "B0018CMJSU", "B00008G8M4", "B00JU949TK", "B008E70EES", "B0045HCJFS", "B0004Z33EG", "B00AKGG828", "B008JFURII", "B001B3LIOC", "B002GSXKP6", "B00026ZG10", "B003Q6D2B4", "B000BPL2FQ", "B009HIKAN8", "B000TGJ8CQ", "B000QUCRB4", "B0004Z33F0", "B000059H9A", "B000RJO56E", "B000HT38BM", "B000P0J06K", "B006VRRGNK", "6304712987", "0790738953", "B00016MSV2", "0767803434", "0790736411", "B003AWRMCE", "B00562I40K", "0783226888", "B00005R2IS", "B00023B1LC", "B002Z7FWBI", "B000FO0AA6", "B001E75QH0", "0767807588", "B00015YVDG", "B001TODCII", "B005LAIGLE", "0800195175", "B00005ATZT", "B00BEJL6JK", "B001AJIHC8", "B00005JKIP", "B00BLF9FOK", "B004SIP9Z6", "B004GJYRK0", "B00029NMRM", "B000VWYJ86", "B007X4ECMI", "B000F9RB9Y", "B000P0J0EM", "B0009X76XC", "B00AEFYUQQ", "B001ZGKOG8", "B000NA1WGS", "B007SPPANM", "B00AEFXKUI", "0790731924", "6305767866", "B00007AJG4", "B003ASLJNQ", "B004AZ7ZKY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000YGDNPO", "B00BUAEYVK", "B000O78KW4", "B000U1ZV8K"]}, "price": 30.25, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 225698}, "asin": "6305286566", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Y1Q1JSPHL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Die Hard Trilogy"}

{"description": "Junior Bonneris director Sam Peckinpah's lovely, elegiac look at  the world of the rodeo--and his only film with nary a bullet wound. Steve McQueen, engagingly easygoing but determined, is the title character, a rodeo rider out to win a big bull-riding contest in his hometown. Even as he confronts his dwindling days on the circuit, he also must deal with his feuding parents, marvelously played by Robert Preston and Ida Lupino. Preston is particularly good as the randy old con artist; he and Lupino strike real sparks. Peckinpah's slow-motion camera is put to particularly good use filming the balletic violence of the rodeo, at once more terrifying and awe-inspiring than any gun battle.

{"description": "The beast inThe Flying Serpentis Quetzalcoatl, the feathered serpent god of  the Aztecs. Evil archaeologist George Zucco keeps this half-bird,  half-reptile creature caged in a secret chamber within some New Mexico ruins,  the better to guard a cache of Montezuma's hidden gold. The professor has  obviously cracked under the strain of his studies, leading his stepdaughter  to deliver the immortal line, \"I wish there was never any such thing as Aztec  Indians.\" (They probably feel the same way about you, honey.) The Q-monster's  killings are investigated by a radio sleuth, adding a weird wrinkle to the  scenario; important revelations in the story have a funny way of happening  while the sleuth's show is live on the air. Two reasons for seeing this  58-minute cheapie from rock-bottom PRC studio: George Zucco, the tireless, beetle-browed villain of countless '40s B&nbsp;movies (with the occasional  goodie, such as Moriarty inThe Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, thrown in),  and the campy Quetzalcoatl, a forerunner of Japanese horror-movie monsters. In this film, the Aztec deity generally resembles a poorly crafted pi&ntilde;ata  flung across a wire--he flaps his wings with that weird,  aerodynamically suspect motion familiar to Rodan-watchers. For more on the  adventures of Quetzalcoatl, see Larry Cohen's 1983 thrillerQ: The Winged Serpent, a nutty variation on the same creature.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00HFWETZ8", "B00D9EJFV4", "B00FMGPWNW", "B00D9EJFZA", "B0007R4T26", "B00007G1TI", "B00DOZNGC2", "B000EHSVJG", "B00005R1O7", "B000VX9WB4", "B000C20VNM", "B0047DKLBO", "B007HCI4SE", "B00B2M79XQ", "B005OT7XMU", "B009AGEWYA", "B00D3DJH7S", "B00BUWD7Q6", "B0000JD28S", "B001DM3QDM", "B00AOO5NW2", "B000787YRW", "B00B2TTVS0", "B00DE1LD6W", "B00AOO5QVK", "B000K0YM18", "B005E7SFH4", "B000BYA5I2", "B0079R1LNM", "B0000542CN", "B000RXVNCE", "B00AQMWEKG", "6305836833", "6305772711"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005OT7YX8", "B0007R4T26", "B0071EKJWM", "B00008973H"]}, "price": 9.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 252160}, "asin": "630547253X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/611R1F37K2L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Flying Serpent"}

{"description": "\"I have a bad feeling about this,\" says the young Obi-Wan Kenobi  (played by Ewan McGregor) inStar Wars: Episode I, The Phantom  Menaceas he steps off a spaceship and into the most anticipated cinematic event... well, ever. He might as well be speaking for the  legions of fans of the original episodes in theStar Warssaga  who can't help but secretly ask themselves: Sure, this isStar  Wars, but is itmy Star Wars? The original elevated  moviegoers' expectations so high that it would have been impossible for  any subsequent film to meet them. And as with all theStar Warsmovies,The Phantom Menacefeatures inexplicable plot twists, a  fistful of loose threads, and some cheek-chewing dialogue. Han Solo's  swagger is sorely missed, as is the pervading menace of heavy-breathing  Darth Vader. There is still way too much quasi-mystical mumbo jumbo,  and some of what was fresh aboutStar Wars22 years earlier  feels formulaic. Yet there's much to admire. The special effects are  stupendous; three worlds are populated with a m&eacute;lange of creatures, flora, and horizons rendered in absolute  detail. The action and battle scenes are breathtaking in their  complexity. And one particular sequence of the film--the  adrenaline-infused pod race through the Tatooine desert--makes the chariot race inBen-Hurlook like a Sunday stroll through the park.Among the host of new characters, there are a few familiar walk-ons. We  witness the first meeting between R2-D2 and C-3PO, Jabba the Hutt looks  younger and slimmer (but not young and slim), and Yoda is as crabby as  ever. Natalie Portman's stately Queen Amidala sports hairdos that make  Princess Leia look dowdy and wields a mean laser. We never bond with  Jedi Knight Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson), and Obi-Wan's day is yet to come. Jar Jar Binks, a cross  between a Muppet, a frog, and a hippie, provides many of the movie's lighter moments, while Sith Lord Darth  Maul is a formidable force. Baby-faced Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd) looks too young  and innocent to command the powers of the Force or wield a lightsaber (much less transmute into the future Darth Vader), but his  boyish exuberance wins over skeptics.Near the end of the movie, Palpatine, the new leader of the Republic,  may be speaking for fans eagerly awaitingEpisode IIwhen he  pats young Anakin on the head and says, \"We will watch your career with  great interest.\" Indeed! --Tod Nelson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000633ZP", "6301792734", "B00005JLXH", "B00006HBUJ", "6304539258", "6304539274", "6301792769", "B000FQVX78", "6304539290", "0792158261", "B000FQJAJG", "6304117752", "0767729307", "B001GQSY5K", "6304178352", "B000FAGGWQ", "B00BBND56G", "B000FQJAIW", "B00005LL26", "B00003CXCT", "B00003CXI0", "B002I9Z8AS", "B00006AL1C", "B00CFWWDWE", "B000066HAS", "B000001ON6", "B000MUANT6", "6305587159"], "bought_together": ["B00005JLXH", "B00006HBUJ"], "also_viewed": ["B00006HBUJ", "B00005JLXH", "B00E9PMML2", "B0000633ZP", "6301792734", "B00BBND56G", "6304539258", "6301792769", "6304539274", "B00006JDUE", "0767729307", "B00E9PMMX0", "B000FQJAIW", "B000FQVX78", "B000FQJAJG", "B00000IQMT", "B000FAGGWQ", "B003ZSJ212", "0345434110", "6303148352", "6304089767", "0439834775", "6304117752", "B00BUZW14M", "6304500831", "0590010891", "0345341465", "6304434340", "B001GQSY5K", "155890641X", "B00005LL26", "6302961572", "0792151712", "B003W77SEO", "B000M4Y8JI", "0767825411", "B00003CXXI", "B00000IZ8A", "B00169IZN8", "6302787068", "B00006G8LB", "080010367X", "0800125762", "6302091632", "0792158261", "B000850IS6", "6300214826", "6303506291", "B00005V1Z8", "B000641D2Y", "0784011923", "B00008Y47S", "6300214060", "630382790X", "B00003CXI0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 79460}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.44, "brand": "Star Wars", "asin": "630575067X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41SJPKK4S4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Star Wars - Episode I, The Phantom Menace [VHS]"}

Sean is now a deputy in Amity. One night, during the Christmas season, Sean is called to untangle a log from a buoy, and when Sean goes to the buoy, he's killed by a great white shark. After hearing about this, Michael, who is studying to be a marine biologist, visits Amity with his wife Carla and his 5-year-old daughter Thea.

{"description": "This little-seen, 1947 drama is a treat for jazz fans, thanks to an otherwise creaky, if nobly intentioned story built around the music's Crescent City genesis that provides an ample excuse to turn the camera on authentic jazz greats. Nick Duquesne (Arturo De Cordova) is a Bourbon Street charmer whose gambling club provides the mythic stomping grounds for none other than Louis Armstrong, whose vocalizing sweetheart Endie, played by none other than Billie Holiday, proves no slouch herself. A newly arrived debutante, Miralee (Dorothy Patrick), arrives in New Orleans and falls first for the music and then for the roguish but ultimately gallant Nick. The movie follows knee-jerk plot machinations revolving around her family's efforts to excise Nick from her life, her own dream of mingling jazz and classical music, and the gambler's transformation into a jazz promoter.The script works in the squalor and much of the geography of Storyville and the French Quarter, even providing a contrasting look at the genteel parlor music being played in \"respectable\" casinos, and the casting telegraphs the production's reverence for jazz. Satchmo's other musical partners are equally serendipitous, including Kid Ory, Barney Bigard, Bud Scott, Zutty Singleton, Meade \"Lux\" Lewis, and Red Callender. A brief arc late in the film adds Woody Herman and his orchestra.When the musicians are featured,New Orleansis a frequent delight, with Armstrong as magnetic as always, and Holiday endearing. As an actress, she's a terrific singer, and luckily Lady Day's dialogue is far briefer than her featured vocals. The DVD version boasts additional period shorts showcasing Armstrong (1932's \"A Rhapsody in Black and Blue\") and Holiday's \"Symphony in Black\" from 1935).--Sam Sutherland", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000BBOUHM", "B002Q1LK9G", "B00BX8A8UK", "B00AEFYG3S", "B000AZ78RI", "B00FRKKVL6", "B000BITUEI", "B0045HCJ8U", "B000BOH922", "0807155055", "B000EU1Q1I", "6305262268", "B000AA4JMA", "B0006UEVVS", "B002TVQ4D0", "B000BT96K0", "B001E1HCRI", "B000GIXECM", "B006AC9H92", "B000050IKZ", "B000BNTMAA", "B000H9HWRS", "B0016OM3TU", "B00003CX8U", "B0009S4IGA", "B0008ENIAC", "B00005OSLK", "B0000AUHQ6", "B000RIWATO"], "bought_together": ["B000BBOUHM"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000BBOUHM", "6305262268", "B000OCY654", "B000BOH922"]}, "price": 20.98, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 131986}, "asin": "6305820783", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/216NVZGM9YL.jpg", "title": "New Orleans"}

{"description": "Seven films. Four Bonds. One set. This sprawling collection surveys over 30 years of James Bond skullduggery, from the cold war tensions of the 1960s to the international free-for-all of the present. Sean Connery remains the coolest of the Bonds, a ruthless agent with dry martini wit and a way with the women, and inGoldfingerhis steely presence helped forge the Bond formula of tongue-in-cheek wit, wondrous secret agent toys created by Q, and megalomaniac supervillains bent on world destruction.Thunderballupped the Bond ante with the most ambitious adventure--and budget--to date. Roger Moore brought an altogether lighter tone to 007 withLive and Let Die, softening Connery's rough edges with a more romantic persona as the films became even more exotic. After a brief digression into outer space,For Your Eyes Onlyreturned Bond to  globetrotting high adventure and teamed him with his most endearing ally (Topol as a gregarious smuggler). Timothy Dalton made his second and final appearance as Bond inLicence to Kill, the toughest of the Bond films since Connery's early efforts. Though not a fan favorite, it's a sleek, solid adventure with an edge missing from the Moore pictures. Pierce Brosnan is the latest to take on 007's licence to kill, combining the best of Connery's cool and Moore's humor.GoldenEyeis the best Bond film in years, a grand globetrotting adventure with lovely Bond girls and a tough new M (Judy Dench).Tomorrow Never Diesdoesn't recapture that magic mix of action, gadgetry, and romance, but does feature the first Bond girl to match 007 blow for blow: Hong Kong action superstar Michelle Yeoh. Taken together, this set is a veritable cross-section of the many faces of James Bond. All that's missing is George Lazenby.

{"description": "When Steven Spielberg was an adolescent, his first home movie was a backyard war film. When he toured Europe withDuelin his 20s, he saw old men crumble in front of headstones at Omaha Beach. That image became the opening scene ofSaving Private Ryan, his film of a mission following the D-day invasion that many have called the most realistic--and maybe the best--war film ever. With 1998 production standards, Spielberg has been able to create a stunning, unparalleled view of war as hell. We are at Omaha Beach as troops are slaughtered by Germans yet overcome the almost insurmountable odds.A stalwart Tom Hanks plays Captain Miller, a soldier's soldier, who takes a small band of troops behind enemy lines to retrieve a private whose three brothers have recently been killed in action. It's a public relations move for the Army, but it has historical precedent dating back to the Civil War. Some critics of the film have labeled the central characters stereotypes. If that is so, this movie gives stereotypes a good name: Tom Sizemore as the deft sergeant, Edward Burns as the hotheaded Private Reiben, Barry Pepper as the religious sniper, Adam Goldberg as the lone Jew, Vin Diesel as the oversize Private Caparzo, Giovanni Ribisi as the soulful medic, and Jeremy Davies, who as a meek corporal gives the film its most memorable performance.The movie is as heavy and realistic as Spielberg's Oscar-winningSchindler's List, but it's more kinetic. Spielberg and his ace technicians (the film won five Oscars: editing (Michael Kahn), cinematography (Janusz Kaminski), sound, sound effects, and directing) deliver battle sequences that wash over the eyes and hit the gut. The violence is extreme but never gratuitous. The final battle, a dizzying display of gusto, empathy, and chaos, leads to a profound repose.Saving Private Ryantouches us deeper thanSchindlerbecause it succinctly links the past with how we should feel today. It's the film Spielberg was destined to make.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00006C7G9", "6303168507", "6303057225", "B00AEBBA36", "6302529441", "0800125762", "6304935811", "B00003CXTF", "B000EHSVS2", "0790734060", "6303257844", "6302415853", "B0007TKNGA", "6301247345", "6301662954", "0790734079", "6302610702", "6302909023", "630407185X", "0783221347", "079213690X", "0800132009", "0790701251", "6305363668", "6301115430", "0790752395", "6304071876", "6300268748"], "bought_together": ["B00006C7G9"], "also_viewed": ["0792151712", "6301792734", "0792837614", "B00003CXXO", "6303109950", "6304117752", "6303402348", "6303168507", "B00003CXTF", "B000RC7QVC", "0783221347", "078323662X", "630018627X", "6304151306", "0783230095", "6304233639", "B0000040EJ", "6303187064"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 269908}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 0.5, "brand": "", "asin": "B00000K3AM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4143F912CXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Saving Private Ryan [VHS]"}

{"description": "Comparisons toThe Blair Witch Projectare inevitable for the inventive, satiricalThe Last Broadcast, a chilling and funny mockumentary by filmmakers Stefan Avalos and Lance Weiler. Besides being made and coming to prominence around the same time (though without aBlair Witch-style marketing juggernaut),The Last Broadcastalso details the doomed travails of some amateur filmmakers as they track a mysterious, murderous legend in a dark forest. Hmmm, sound familiar? Actually,The Last Broadcasttakes a different tack on this premise, one more media-savvy thanBlair Witch. Turns out that this is the latest installment of theX-Files-ish public access showFact or Fiction, and its doofusy hosts (Avalos and Weiler themselves) plan on doing a live broadcast from deep in the New Jersey woods on their ongoing quest for the Bigfoot-like Jersey Devil. Teaming up with two Internet-based fans, they plunge themselves and their equipment into the wintry woods; only one man, the creepy psychic Jim (Jim Seward), returns, and is promptly convicted of the murders of the other three. While it does boast footage made by the \"dead\" filmmakers,The Last Broadcastis more formally structured as a documentary, complete with officious, muckraking host (David Leigh) and much behind-the-scenes footage. We're let in on the backgrounds of the victims, the 911 phone calls, the murder trial, the inconsistencies the prosecution overlooked, and the painstaking work of reconstructing the film stock, which may unlock the mystery of the true killer. Filmed entirely with digital cameras and assembled on digital systems for a mind-boggling $900,The Last Broadcastboasts a great look and a sharp, satiric eye for sending up the media--Avalos and Weiler are in calm command of their medium and message. The film does take a sharp turn that could either enrage or amaze viewers enraptured by what's preceded, but it's a minor quibble at best. And unlikeThe Blair Witch Project,The Last Broadcastdoes answer all the mysterious questions it raises.--Mark Englehart", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 622788}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.96, "brand": "", "asin": "B00001WY85", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51EVVR863XL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Last Broadcast [VHS]"}

Superbly paced, the film  is both epic and intimate, offering astonishing special effects and production  design while emphasizing the emotional intensity of Frodo's adventure.

{"description": "From director/screenwriter Amy Heckerling (Clueless, Fast Times at Ridgemont High) comes LOSER, a college comedy about trusting yourself, taking a chance and turning your back on the people who take advantage of you. Nerdy, good-natured Paul Tannek (American Pie's Jason Biggs) is a square peg in the round hole that is New York University. His pot-smoking, girl-chasing roommates hate him, and everyone else on campus ignores him. But when he meets fellow student Dora Diamond (Mena Suvari, American Beauty), he discovers a kindred spirit. Dora is pratically broke, has nowhere to live, and her boyfriend, Professor Edward Alcott (Oscar(r) nominee Greg Kinnear), is more interested in manipulating her than loving her. The more people push them around, the closer Paul and Dora get-she helps him dress better and appreciate New York, he lets her stay with him while she finds a job. In the end, Paul and Dora not only fall for each other, they find the courage to walk away from the people who walk", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00DMDE02Q", "B00005KA6V", "B00003CXGJ", "B00000F0AD", "B00441GYVA", "6305907110", "B00005J761", "B00005K3OS", "B005Z9MFRC", "B00LBHOCHS", "B000LC3ICE", "B000069HQ2", "B004SIP9X8", "B00447L4KA", "B00005LQ03", "B00005JCCB", "B000CPH9PM", "B00441GYVK", "B00E1HIX66", "B000IZJZIU", "B006WXHJLC", "B00DW5IL92", "B000XJD35M", "B00003CXMP", "B00008G7UG", "B001L9EXTS", "B00AEFXO8Q", "B0050ODZ6M", "B00008L3T3", "B004P7CN7W", "B000031EFY", "B00066FAZ8", "B000065K5H", "B00AEFYSL8", "B00005U8QN", "0767824954", "B00003CXGG", "B00006ZXSO", "B000BBOUUE", "B00003CXO1", "B004SUDQ1I", "B00E1HIXEI", "B002XUBDRY", "6305428425", "B000E6EHE0", "B00AEFXUXU", "B003VA3JZO", "B00005V9HR", "B00000J122", "B00DW5IKYS", "B000067J1O", "B00COHGPQA", "B00003CXE4", "B005LAIH9A", "B000021Y7E", "B00AEFXPG2", "B0009P42WI", "B00003CXS7", "B000P0J0CO", "B00005JMX6", "B00005JMON", "630587493X", "B00562I40K", "B000031WD9", "B00007AJGM", "B0045HCJRG", "B005Z9MGRG", "B002O3Z4ZW", "B0000524E5", "B000069CF0", "B0002V7TMY", "6305428549", "B00AMEZDJW", "B0053TWVQ4", "B00441GZ1E", "B006YTGL86", "B0000797IO", "B0010VDYLK", "B004GJYRA0", "B000053VB5", "076784744X", "B00008977A", "B000HIVIOC", "B001O0TWYK", "B00008K7AM", "B001GP5TMW", "B00GRZPRB4", "B00002SSKI", "6305433925", "B00BTYSIWI", "B000053UIF", "B000K7UBSO", "B004SEUJ9Q", "B004SIP6LS", "B00HZMZ2FE", "B0016MJ6GA", "B0014D5PO8", "B00AEFZ3XU", "B000069HYG", "0792840127"], "bought_together": ["B00DMDE02Q", "B00447L4KA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005KA6V", "B00447L4KA", "0060540745", "B00AMEZDJW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 64408}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.58, "brand": "Columbia/Tristar Studios", "asin": "B00003CXK7", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51YYXFWZRHL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Loser"}

{"description": "To callPearl Harbora throwback to old-time war movies is something of an understatement. Director Michael Bay's epic take on the bombing that brought the United States into World War II hijacks every war movie situation and clich&#xE9; (some affectionate, some stale) you've ever seen and gives them a shiny, glossy spin until the whole movie practically gleams. Planes glisten, water sparkles, trees beckon--and Bay's re-creation of the bombing itself, a 30-minute sequence that's tightly choreographed and amazingly photographed, sets the action movie bar up quite a few notches. And in updating the classic war film, Bay and screenwriter Randall Wallace (Braveheart) use that old plot standby, the love triangle--this time, it's between two pilots (Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett) and a nurse (Kate Beckinsale) who find themselves stationed at Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, during what they thought would be a nice, sunny tour of duty. Then, of course, history intervened.For the first 90 minutes of the movie, Affleck and Beckinsale find a nice, appealing chemistry that plays on his strengths as a movie star and hers as a serious actress--he gives her glamour, she gives him smarts. Their truncated romance--the beginning of which is told in flashback so we can get right to the point where he has to leave her to go to England--works, thanks to their charm. They're no Kate and Leo fromTitanic(a strategy the film strives hard toward), but they're pretty darn adorable in their own right. Hartnett, as the not entirely unwelcome third wheel, squints bravely but makes only a slight dent in the film. Everyone else inPearl Harbor--from Cuba Gooding Jr.'s brave navy seaman to Jon Voight's able impersonation of FDR--is pretty much a glorified walk-on, taking a backseat to the pyrotechnics and action sequences that keep the three-hour film in fairly constant motion. But when that action does take hold,Pearl Harboris quite a thrilling ride.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792151712", "B000059HGY", "B00000K3AN", "B00AEBBA36", "0792133153", "079212569X", "6305169187", "6301734734", "0792147618", "0792116887", "6304618344", "079213690X", "6303269834", "6304925131", "6305718792", "6304259131", "B00004WIDB", "6304935811", "6303057225", "6304143184", "6302250269"], "bought_together": ["B00000K3AN", "B00AEBBA36"], "also_viewed": ["B00000G3PA", "0792151712", "6300213668", "B00000JS61", "6303215734", "6303402348", "B00004WIDB", "079213690X", "6305750750", "B004751DFU", "B00005O893", "B00000K3AN", "6301792734", "B00E5I2MCM", "6305169187", "B00007LVCM", "B007SPPANM", "B00L4K3MLE", "B00FLML7HW", "B008QZ5PY2", "B00JBGWP3Y"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 234413}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.49, "brand": "", "asin": "B00003CXTF", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HC1ZDJN6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]"}
{"description": "Imagine a Cheech and Chong pothead comedy, only instead of two scruffy  lowlifes, the movie is about an aimless Scottish gardener and a middle-aged  British widow with a green thumb. Grace (Brenda Blethyn ofSecrets and  LiesandLittle Voice) has just discovered that her recently deceased  husband has left her with an enormous debt when her gardener Matthew (Craig  Ferguson,The Big Tease) asks her to help him tend to his small,  personal-use marijuana crop. Grace soon realizes that they can turn her green  house into a hydroponics laboratory and turn out a profitable crop--if only they  can keep the local constables at bay and then find a dealer to actually sell the  stuff.Saving Gracehas well-developed characters, intelligent dialogue,  a charming and capable cast, and clean, clear direction. But at heart it's still  a marijuana comedy, with most of its funniest moments coming from the silly,  stoned behavior of elderly ladies and other stuffy Brits. Nothing wrong with  that, and Blethyn and Ferguson give the film a strong anchor. The ending goes a  little over-the-top, but most of the movie is well-grounded in genuine human  behavior. A subplot about Matthew's girlfriend's pregnancy is treated with  respect and integrity.

{"description": "Jurassic ParkSteven Spielberg's 1993 mega-hit rivalsJawsas the most intense and frightening film he'd ever made prior toSchindler's List, but it was also among his weakest stories. Based on Michael Crichton's novel about an island amusement park populated by cloned dinosaurs, the film works best as a thrill ride with none of the interesting human dynamics of Spielberg'sJaws. That lapse proves unfortunate, but there's no shortage of raw terror as a rampagingT. rexand nasty raptors try to make fast food out of the cast. The effects are still astonishing (despite the fact that the computer-generated technology has since been improved upon) and at times primeval, such as the sight of a herd of whatever-they-are scampering through a valley.--Tom KeoghThe Lost World: Jurassic ParkAfter the global phenomenon that wasJurassic Park, it was a given that novelist Michael Crichton would conjure up a sequel and that Steven Spielberg would then commit it to film. Considering the potential profit involved, it was practically a commercial mandate. Perhaps it was inevitable that both efforts were contrived, and well below the talents of Crichton (well, maybe) and certainly Spielberg, who just didn't have the heart for this recycling after the artistic triumph ofSchindler's List. What we're left with, for better and worse, is a redundant blockbuster that still benefits from Spielberg's mastery of high-intensity action sequences and the further development of amazing computer-generated special effects. What's missing is the awe and wonder that madeJurassic Parka technical marvel and a dazzling product of scientific imagination. The story's a no-brainer: after the deadly fiasco of the original dinosaur theme park, we're taken (along with returning star Jeff Goldblum) to a second island where genetically engineered dinosaurs still thrive under the watchful eye of Goldblum's biologist girlfriend (Julianne Moore). But a devious capitalist (Arliss Howard) is determined to export dinosaurs to a new park in San Diego, financing a hunt-and-capture expedition that results in another series of fatal disasters. In Spielberg's hands this movie's more exciting than it has a right to be, given the creative paucity of Crichton's novel and David Koepp's adapted screenplay. The special effects are state-of-the-art, and theT. rex's rampage through the streets of San Diego is nothing short of spectacular; but apparently an improvement upon the shortcomings ofJurassic Parkwas too much to hope for.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0087ZG7J8", "B00003CXC5", "B00008G8M4", "0767817478", "B00000ILDH", "B001VLBDD0", "B000NQRR1Q", "B0087ZG7NO", "B0087ZG7HK", "B001F7MSFM", "B007STBUHI", "B00005N5S5", "B000ASATYY", "B0054OGQM8", "B00005R2IS", "B001DJLD1M", "B00177YA1K", "B002O3Z50G", "B006VRRGNK", "B000VWYJ86", "B00005JM5E", "B000VR0570", "B000N4RAQU", "0800141687", "B000LC3IB0", "B0000VCZK2", "B000NA1WGS", "B000OVLBF8", "B000MX7V70", "6304698739", "B0090SI1RM", "6305127646", "B000068MBV", "B00070FX5U", "B0004Z33G4", "B00AKGG828", "B005CFBZWK", "B00005A8XX", "B0007TKNLA", "0394588169", "B00003CXCT", "B004EPZ08O", "0790729342", "B0002V7OI8", "B000ASATZ8", "B000I0RQVI", "B000A2UBN4", "B0000844I8", "B000Y7U98C", "B00000G3PA", "B00000JQB5", "B004H83INW", "B0000AUHOH", "B002HWRYJE", "B005G4TJUC", "B00E5I2MCM", "B002U4UYYQ", "B002I9Z8AS", "B00005JOC9", "B005COLETU", "B000VNMMR0", "B000U1ZV8K", "B00005V9HR", "B002GIBVVG", "B00005JLV5", "6304711905", "B007SPPANM", "0783225733", "B008Y1YK9Y", "B00HFFE8HE", "B000O77SQS", "B0064SVO9I", "6305181721", "0767803434", "B00AEBBA72", "B00006HBUJ", "B005FH1RRI", "B000VG66XS", "B00DB97LRC", "B001TK80C0", "B000U7WV1Y", "B001HQZJMU", "B002GSXKNI", "B0001Z37HM", "B00005JNJV", "B0000VV55I", "B000QFCD7W", "B000P0J09W", "B00005JPD0", "B0009RCPY8", "B0002KVUKM", "B001AK3S4Y", "B000VECAD0", "B00008PC13", "B00000ILDD", "B005LAIHXQ", "B0024FADD8", "B003PIUINS", "B0007NY3AI", "B00AEFYYWQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0057RCFQS", "B0087ZG7HK", "B0087ZG7NO", "B0087ZG7J8"]}, "price": 38.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 30243}, "asin": "B00004U8KV", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515uQ-e9JRL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Jurassic Park: The Collection (Jurassic Park / The Lost World) (Widescreen)"}

{"description": "Laurence Olivier broke with the theatrical poise of previous  roles to play seedy music-hall entertainer Archie Rice in John  Osborne's acclaimed play,The Entertainer, reprising the role in  Tony Richardson's 1960 screen version and earning an Oscar nomination  for his performance. Olivier gives his all as the gap-toothed  vaudevillian living in the shadow of his music-hall-legend father Billy  Rice (Roger Livesey), spitting out pithy wisecracks and mugging  pathetically for bored audiences in seaside dives. Under the  life-of-the-party patter, however, is a pathetic music-hall dinosaur trying too  hard for his moment in the spotlight, nursing his wounded humiliation  in trysts with na&iuml;ve young girls and pouring out his passion in  his finale tune, \"Why Should I Care.\" \"I have an affinity with Archie  Rice,\" Olivier once opined. \"It's what I really am. I'm not like  Hamlet.\"Shot on location on the boardwalk carnivals and holiday camps of the  British seaside, the shabby show-biz world is beautifully photographed  but never quite shakes off its origins on the stage. It's the vivid  performances that drive the drama: Joan Plowright (who married Olivier  in 1961) as his pragmatic daughter; Alan Bates and Albert Finney  (making their film debuts) as his sons, a next-generation show-biz  hustler and a soldier shipped off to the Suez, respectively; and Brenda  de Banzie as Archie's long-suffering wife. \"You've been a good  audience.

{"description": "Director Frank Darabont created this Frank Capra-inspired drama based on a screenplay by his friend and one-time schoolmate Michael Sloane. Jim Carrey stars as Pete Appleton, a screenwriter in the Hollywood of the 1950s. Pete's on top of the world with his first motion picture \"Sand Pirates of the Sahara\" just released to theaters and his romance with a beautiful starlet (Amanda Detmer) heating up. However, his triumph turns to dismay when he's called before the commie-hunting House Un-American Activities Committee and advised by a studio lawyer and his agent to play ball with the witch hunters. Depressed by the film industry's weak-kneed reaction to the hearings, Pete gets drunk and drives his car north along the California coast, where he crashes from a bridge and wakes up on shore the next morning suffering from amnesia. Wandering into the nearby small town of Lawson, Pete is mistaken for Luke Trimble, a lost hero of World War II who, like most of the area's young men, never returned from the war a decade earlier. \"Luke\" has soon reunited with both his father (Martin Landau) and his one-time girlfriend (Laurie Holden), and finds that his reappearance has given the citizens of Lawson an emotional boost that's sorely needed. When he refurbishes and reopens his family's decrepit movie theater, the Majestic, Luke revitalizes Lawson just as his memory of his true identity begins to reassert itself. Sloane's original script for The Majestic (2001) was entitled The Bijou.", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 298103}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.75, "brand": "", "asin": "B00005JKNB", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GZ710HSNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Majestic [VHS]"}

{"description": "Gosford Parkfinds director Robert Altman in sumptuously fine form indeed. From the opening shots, as the camera peers through the trees at an opulent English country estate, Altman exploits the 1930s period setting and whodunit formula of the film expertly. Aristocrats gather together for a weekend shooting party with their dutiful servants in tow, and the upstairs/downstairs division of the classes is perfectly tailored to Altman's method (as employed inNashvilleandShort Cuts) of overlapping bits of dialogue and numerous subplots in order to betray underlying motives and the sins that propel them. Greed, vengeance, snobbery, and lust stir comic unrest as the near dizzying effect of brisk script turns is allayed by perhaps Altman's strongest ensemble to date.

{"description": "The key component of this Vista Series DVD is a six-part documentary about the making of the film from idea to theatrical release. M. Night Shyamalan talks at length about the film and his filmmaking technique in this exclusive one-hour feature. The approach is straightforward but at times is as self-congratulatory as a marketing puff piece. Because Shyamalan works so leanly, the five deleted scenes are excellent, including a chilling scene from the film's final act. Also included are storyboard comparisons and another glimpse of one of Shyamalan's early home movies.Signsis the first of the Vista Series to be a single disc and the extras seem light, but there are only a couple of quibbles: the director again does not provide a commentary track and there is no DTS soundtrack.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00004BZIY", "B00064LJVE", "B001DZOC6Y", "B00003CXQA", "B000JLTR8Q", "B004SIP92O", "B00AEFYYH6", "B003102JDC", "B00005JNTI", "B00000G3PA", "B002GHHHKQ", "B003Y5H4SO", "B0002DB54A", "B00008G8M4", "B00AEBBA2W", "B0000648X0", "630471193X", "B002O3Z50G", "B00011CZRE", "B000PHVZNE", "B0087ZG7HK", "B002NZK5SM", "B00004XPPG", "B00005JOC9", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B0021L8UXA", "0783225733", "B0006L0LOS", "B0006SGYL0", "B000NOKFHQ", "B005LAIHXQ", "0800177029", "6305767866", "B00004TS0G", "6304711891", "B00AEFY3MC", "B002GIBVVG", "B004SIP8ZM", "B000U1ZV8K", "B00005JNY3", "B00070FX5U", "B00AEBB8NI", "B0002KVUKM", "B00008G8LY", "B000F6IOAM", "B00005JN0T", "B00AEBBA36", "B002LMV7R0", "B002NZK5UU", "B0013FDM7E", "B002O3Z4WK", "B0068FZ0GK", "B00015YVDG", "B000LC55F2", "B00001ZWUS", "B002GHHHL0", "B000BTJDGC", "B000EHRVOW", "B0087ZG7J8", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00005JN2Z", "B000P0J0EM", "B00AEFXSLE", "B00019073K", "B00005LC4D", "B00005JL78", "B00IBKXSKA", "B004EPYZPS", "B00000JDIQ", "B00AEBB9WI", "B000RIWAVW", "0780618548", "B004SIP7ZS", "B00005JN0W", "B00AEFXNLY", "6305428115", "0767811100", "0800141601", "B00AEFXT1S", "0780631536", "B00000IQC4", "B004P7CNUY", "B001GCUO02", "B002AS464Q", "B00003CWS3", "B00006FDCD", "B000FS9FCG", "B00005JKZH", "B000067FP8", "B000K7VHQE", "B00BEIYG98", "B00005JNNT", "B000068NNU", "B000XT1P4S", "B0087ZG7PW", "B002O3Z4ZW", "B002I9Z8BM", "B00AEFXKUI", "B0010X73ZG", "B00003CXIP"], "bought_together": ["B00004BZIY", "B004SIP92O"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00004BZIY", "B00386EZUY", "B000QUU4M8", "B0000VCZK2"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 11300}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.99, "brand": "Touchstone Video", "asin": "B00005JL3T", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51c02AOAyCL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Signs"}

{"description": "A Beautiful Mindmanages to twist enough pathos out of John Nash's incredible life story to redeem an at-times goofy portrayal of schizophrenia. Russell Crowe tackles the role with characteristic fervor, playing the Nobel prize-winning mathematician from his days at Princeton, where he developed a groundbreaking economic theory, to his meteoric rise to the cover ofForbesmagazine and an MIT professorship, and on through to his eventual dismissal due to schizophrenic delusions. Of course, it is the delusions that fascinate director Ron Howard and, predictably, go astray. Nash's other world, populated as it is by a maniacal Department of Defense agent (Ed Harris), an imagined college roommate who seems straight out ofDead Poets Society, and an orphaned girl, is so fluid and scriptlike as to make the viewer wonder if schizophrenia is really as slick as depicted. Crowe's physical intensity drags us along as he works admirably to carry the film on his considerable shoulders. No doubt the story of Nash's amazing will to recover his life without the aid of medication is a worthy one, his eventual triumph heartening.

{"description": "Fill a bowl with alpine strawberries, break out the Ch&acirc;teau Lafite (1899, of course), and bask in this benchmark 1981 British miniseries based on Evelyn Waugh's classic novel. Adapted for the screen by John Mortimer (Rumpole of the Bailey), this impeccable, nearly 11-hour production mesmerized American viewers during the course of its PBS run in 1982. In his breakthrough role, Jeremy Irons stars as Charles Ryder, a disillusioned Army captain who is moved to reflect on his \"languid days\" in the \"enchanted castle\" that was Brideshead, home of the aristocratic Marchmain family, whose acquaintance Charles made in the company of an Oxford classmate, the charming wild child Sebastian. Anthony Andrews costars as the doomed Sebastian, whose beauty is \"arresting\" and \"whose eccentricities and behavior seemed to know no bounds.\" The \"entitled and enchanted\" Sebastian takes Charles under his wing (\"Charles, what a lot you have to learn\"), but vows early on that he is \"not going to let [Charles] get mixed up with [his] family.\" But mixed up Charles gets. He becomes a friend and confidante, not to mention a lover, to Sebastian's sister Julia (Diana Quick). Meanwhile, the self-destructive Sebastian's life spirals out of control.Brideshead Revisitedboasts a distinguished ensemble, including Laurence Olivier in his Emmy Award-winning role as the exiled Lord Marchmain, Claire Bloom as Lady Marchmain, and the magnificent John Gielgud as Charles's estranged father. Grand locations and a haunting musical score make this a memorable revisit of an irretrievable bygone era. For those who scheduled their weeks around the original Monday-night broadcasts or those visitingBridesheadfor the first time, this boxed set release will be, as Charles rhapsodizes at one point while strolling the castle grounds, \"very near to heaven.\"--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001AXL67W", "B006JY3OHW", "B004H0ZHD4", "B00DW5ILF6", "B005GRF2ZU", "B00007149J", "B0083HXKMC", "B008UQUS26", "B009L2EW5W", "0316216453", "B00065GX96", "B00F1BFRA6", "B000056KMW", "B000GYI3D6", "B00EF0NVGQ", "B0054DPLHK", "B0080QOL10", "B00BQXTDIU", "B004JMSIQS", "B0028AEO0M", "0316216445", "B00HUAH14Q", "B0013NAMLK", "B00003CXC9", "B003WEAVZK", "B005X5XIMO", "B00005JOA0", "B004499LWG", "B001B1Q2UO", "0060881305", "B00005V5NU", "B000FQIRXQ", "B004SI5VUO", "B002XTBECY", "B003YCI1UC", "B008KEQLW4", "B0001DCYUU", "B0009PVZIW", "B0007LFPJ8", "B0009PVZL4", "B000E0ODZE", "B007701RFS", "B00BGARGR8", "B000EDWLTQ", "B009Z59ZNE", "B00BOTCJXC", "0060881313", "B00FPPQYXM", "B0074FUSFG", "B001V7UXG2", "B001PU8N0I", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B00HUAGZ34", "B003X2P9B2", "B00B62R9XM", "B0006Z2NAY", "B000784WNQ", "B00023BKO0", "B000M2E32M", "B004JMSIVI", "B004N66XYE", "B000A8AXXG", "B00ANGICCO", "B008PDAENC", "B003WEAW18", "B0007WRT4Q", "B00JLDTBCU", "B0002S648C", "B0009PVZM8", "B001P807RC", "B0012IV3Q4", "B008BF7TBY", "B00D3PYQT0", "B00JKEM36Q", "B000006UQ9", "B0038M2SAW", "B000I2J6WI", "B00D2UMHPG", "B00D2UMHIS", "B00005JKNF", "B004H0ZH20", "B00DUX28XQ", "B00EBBGKTE", "B00005R5GB", "B00003JRCQ", "B002TY78PU", "B0001WTUK8", "B009T6CXG0", "B00DQN6IOK", "B001B3LIPG", "B000S2B23E", "B005DJ7AYC", "B00E320W8Q", "B0011VJRVU", "B00A27O0N4", "B00HGE90Z4", "0316926051", "B000UJ48SQ", "B0099Y2MYK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005GRF2ZU", "0316216453", "B006JY3OHW", "B004H0ZHD4"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 213297}, "asin": "B00005JLG2", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51T8PA0H0KL._SX300_.jpg", "title": "Brideshead Revisited"}

{"description": "With its disturbing images and a few good shocks,The Ringis the kind of frightfest you'll watch to set a chilling mood or spook your susceptible friends, but when you try to sort it out, this well-mounted American remake (of the 1998 Japanese hitRingu, based on Koji Suzuki's popular novel) becomes a batch of incoherent parts. The negligible plot follows a Seattle reporter (Naomi Watts) as she investigates the death of her niece, the victim of a mysterious videotape that, according to urban legend, causes the viewer's death seven days later. (Fear Dot Comborrowed the same idea while avoiding this film's lofty pretensions.) The countdown structure follows the reporter, her son, and her estranged boyfriend into deepening layers of terror--all quite effective until the movie attempts to explain itself.

In other words, the ultimate catch has just met his match!", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002WEEYIQ", "6305499144", "B006YTGL4K", "B000N4SHOE", "B0079K4WEE", "B001TKUXVQ", "B00005JNDZ", "B000077VR3", "B00005JPE3", "B0002JZT5A", "B00K2CHWYI", "B00003CY5G", "B0000996F6", "B00006ZXSO", "B001WAKOW6", "B004SEUJK0", "B0018M6J90", "B004A8ZWV0", "B001RTKKS0", "B0038N9X3Q", "B00BLN4UPG", "B005LAIGXW", "B004SEUJBE", "B002ZG9800", "B000E6ESL2", "B0013D8LC2", "B00003CXHG", "B00008G7UF", "B002ZG988M", "B00006ZXSL", "B00005JN3W", "B00AEFYCW8", "B001LPWGH8", "B006GL8NGU", "B004GJYRA0", "B004L3AR0K", "B00I6JODGO", "B0067EKY7M", "B002VECMAE", "B00AEBB8NS", "B00EIBO8T6", "B00003CXSM", "6304765266", "B000E6EHE0", "B002TQKL7K", "B000ASDFGI", "B00005JLQH", "B00003CY0V", "B0006FO8E8", "B0045HCJRG", "B00005JLYW", "B0011N1WE8", "B002OVED88", "B00023P4RO", "B0001GOH6Q", "B002P413IC", "B000N4SHOO", "B004SIP7AS", "B00D3LA6SY", "B002ZG989G", "B000W089XS", "B009INAC12", "B0013ERFGE", "B000U1ZV8A", "B000OCZA04", "B0007QS2ZC", "B00003CXWM", "B00447L4KA", "B00006FMUW", "B004IK30PA", "B000059PQB", "B004ZG5F28", "B0037E8HOC", "B000XJD33O", "B00006ZXSN", "B004SIP9I8", "B005Z9MFRC", "B000MGB6M8", "B00009QUH4", "B002ZG98FU", "B001CC7PLM", "B00AKGG6JS", "B002ZG97QK", "B000VE4UHO", "B00GTO6WXU", "B001675YQ6", "B000EHRVOW", "B004EPZ0BG", "B00AEBB8YW", "0767819772", "B004YCKKFK", "B000M06KJ8", "B0036TGSIK", "B00005MEVO", "B0007P0X9G", "B008220BA2", "B000MQC9H4", "B002ZG9968", "B003UYUQZW"], "bought_together": ["B002WEEYIQ", "B000N4SHOE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000N4SHOE", "6305499144", "B006YTGL4K", "B000MQC9H4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 17510}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.49, "brand": "Twentieth Century Fox", "asin": "B00005JLZW", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51BW9TPJDML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Down with Love (Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "It's not that the folks at Pixar are geniuses when it comes to DVDs... well, come to think of it, their fifth DVD set shows these folks are wizards. It's not just that the two discs are packed with watchable extras that hardly reiterate the same information; it's how they are handled--funny, inventive, with a light touch--unlike many PR-driven discs. A good place to start is the filmmakers' jolly commentary track, which branches off into 31 minutes of behind-the-scene stuff, deleted scenes, and curious anecdotes (they can also be watched separately). Pixar's first making-of documentary is a most concise and interesting 25-minute examination that also sheds light on how the company works. With a digital-to-digital transfer, the film looks great and is available in widescreen or reformatted to full screen. The \"Family Fun\" disc includes another Pixar made-for-the-DVD gem, the 7-minute \"Exploring the Reef\" with Jean-Michel Cousteau (Jacques's son) being upstaged by Dori and Marlin; it's a hoot and teaches a fact or two you will remember about reefs. Both discs feature lovely menus that can be turned into virtual aquariums for your TV (by removing the text) featuring the knockout colors of the film's settings. Watch long enough for some shenanigans from the film's characters and vocal talent. Genius, pure genius.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00EV1YZ96", "B00AFEX83C", "B00007LVCM", "B00005JNS0", "B0030IIZ4M", "B00GDT5T9Y", "B003ZHVJGO", "B00G5G7EXY", "B00003CXB4", "B001KVZ6FW", "B0013FSL3E", "B004HO6I4M", "B00005JN4W", "B000MV9026", "B004G600A4", "B000AY74OG", "B000VBJEEG", "B0006UEVT0", "B008YWY0HK", "B003H9M1Q2", "B00CQRN3QI", "B0001I561E", "B0042U94UQ", "B00E9ZATJO", "B000YERP2S", "B0006JMLRK", "B000AAF1TU", "B0000AOX0O", "B00CTNYLQA", "B00F522C7C", "B0039N74CW", "B00003CXCQ", "B001ILFUDC", "B00275EHJG", "B001HN6922", "0736429220", "B000B8QG4A", "B000RMJ4F8", "B0084IHVN4", "B002ZG97YM", "B001ECQ75A", "B004ZBACOE", "B0030IIYYS", "B0084IHVGG", "B00E9ZATKI", "B00AO686JC", "B000GUJZ00", "B00004R99S", "B0012EM5D8", "B0084IHVUC", "B0013ND30M", "B0034JKZ86", "B0000VV4W2", "B00003CX8Y", "B008JFUQ16", "B001DPHDCY", "B00005TN8K", "B00CUDD0C0", "B00A83075M", "B001O5LVPI", "B001NCDFTW", "B00G7TIKMI", "B0000E32WJ", "B00CWM58WY", "B001ILFUD2", "B00009YXAW", "B00CMY3JBO", "B00335EQ0E", "B005LAIISA", "0783231474", "B0002YLCOM", "B00E00OGE2", "B000H7JCK0", "B000UVKGPI", "B00005JMQZ", "B00JK531ES", "B00004U9WQ", "B005LAIH4A", "B005LAIHW2", "B00024I2Z4", "B00I6JOD2S", "B008NNY9QW", "B0000VCZKM", "B00FE8BVF6", "6302526574", "B004EPZ034", "B000L22SG6", "B001OMU6UM", "B00E56D8FO", "B0000524D0", "B002WJI2QQ", "B0009CTT6U", "B000050MN3", "B000B8QG3G", "B0058AFS0O", "B00006FDAI", "B00EGIAQ1K", "B000A7G4TY"], "bought_together": ["B00EV1YZ96", "B00G5G7EXY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00EV1YZ96", "B00AFEX83C", "B00I6JOD2S", "B004HO6I4M"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 7746}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 25.5, "brand": "Disney", "asin": "B00005JM02", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51-difUGanL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)"}
{"description": "There's only one deleted scene in this two-disc DVD set, but it's a doozy. The \"Sgt. Candy Scene\" is a must-see and, unfortunately, the best thing on the second disc. The rushed HBO documentary shows us far more flash than substance. Better is the Visual Effects Lab that goes more in-depth with four sequences, although you need to wade through a hokey interface for each segment. Making your \"own\" effects isn't that much fun; you can only choose a few effects that change in two scenes. Anyone looking to get the complicated backstory of the trilogy figured out should dig into the \"Sky Net Database\" and an intricate timeline. The two commentary tracks are worth a listen, with director Jonathan Mostow's solo track the better one. The director goes into great detail on how the little things (from lighting street scenes to tricks for destroying buildings) count.  The second track is pieced together from the actors recorded separately. Mostow appears with actress Claire Danes (doing her first commentary track) and their chemistry is enjoyable after a slow start. The other actors have less interesting things to say, including Schwarzenegger who is constantly--yet enthusiastically--selling the film.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001VLBDD0", "B00005N5S5", "B001FB55HQ", "B00005JA8B", "B00070FX5U", "B00007AJG4", "B002ZG98LO", "B000T9OP7G", "B002GHHHME", "B00005JKIP", "B002QFYJFY", "B0002J58HO", "B0000AXE8I", "B001AQO43M", "B00AKGG828", "B00026ZG10", "B0001BKAEY", "B00IZZDWKM", "B001451HXO", "B0000VCZK2", "B000056PMU", "B000BPL2FQ", "B000RW3VCK", "B0004Z33F0", "B000U1ZV8K", "B0045HCJGC", "B0004Z33EQ", "B00005JNTU", "B000HRMAPE", "B00008G8M4", "B000RRS7RE", "B00005JKYX", "B0000VD12I", "B000FC2FQA", "B00000ILDG", "B00000G3PA", "B00005JMZK", "B000MGBSE4", "B0087ZG7J8", "B0004Z33EG", "B000P0J0AQ", "B00005JMEW", "B0087ZG7NO", "B00003CXTA", "B0002CHK1S", "B000RJO56E", "B00177YA1K", "B00004STDN", "B005COLETU", "B001AK3S4Y", "B000VNMMR0", "B0000959N0", "B00005JMUA", "1558908846", "6305767866", "B001RIY4WE", "B0049IHX2C", "B000VI70QS", "B000EGDB10", "B002GSXKN8", "B00HZMZ2FE", "B0045HCJ9O", "B003QO8TOQ", "B00005JNJV", "B001451HX4", "B00I9TDMRM", "B0006GANOQ", "B00003CXSP", "6305428115", "B00016MSV2", "B00005JOC9", "B000TJBN80", "B009MO57H6", "B000O77SQS", "B0087ZG7HK", "B001OST0M6", "B005LAIHXQ", "B0002J4X1Q", "B0002V7OI8", "B0015XHP2C", "6304806434", "B000QXDED6", "B00005JL3K", "B008JFUPFI", "B003PIUINS", "0783225946", "0792839056", "B00005N7Z1", "B0006GAO6I", "B001DZOC6Y", "B00005JL78", "B001HN697M", "B00IJS2OXG", "B002NXSRVG", "B00008G8M5", "B00005JN0T", "B003XURDAY", "B000O77SRM", "B006VRRGNK", "B00F4FFO8E"], "bought_together": ["B001VLBDD0", "B00005N5S5"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001VLBDD0", "B00005N5S5", "B001FB55HQ", "B002JT6AO0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 115564}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 13.47, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00005JM0B", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5143TFPX8SL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "A broad science fiction thriller in a classic vein,Equilibriumtakes a respectable stab at aFahrenheit 451-like cautionary fable. The story finds Earth's post-World War III humankind in a state of severe emotional repression: If no one feels anything, no one will be inspired by dark passions to attack their neighbors. Writer-director Kurt Wimmer's monochromatic,Metropolis-influenced cityscape provides an excellent backdrop to the heavy-handed mission of John Preston (Christian Bale), a top cop who busts \"sense offenders\" and crushes sentimental, sensual, and artistic relics from a bygone era. Predictably, Preston becomes intrigued by his victims and that which they die to cherish; he stops taking his mandatory, mood-flattening drug and is even aroused by a doomed prisoner (Emily Watson). Wimmer's wrongheaded martial arts/dueling guns motif is sheer silliness (a battle over a puppy doesn't help), butEquilibriumshould be seen for Bale's moving performance as a man shocked back to human feeling.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00006JDVV", "B000LC55F2", "B000FS9FCG", "B0009A40ES", "B000KX0IM2", "B0007Y08QA", "B00AEFYCW8", "0767805712", "B00005JL78", "B0018O4YT0", "B001FB55HQ", "B00003CXZ4", "B00AEFXCLU", "B000FGGE68", "B000WMA6R8", "B002ZG980U", "B003XURDAY", "B00HOGBXS6", "B00005JPAR", "B000GFLKF8", "B00K2CHX9C", "B00AEFXW8I", "B000XR9L50", "B004XQO90O", "B000N6TX1I", "B000FKO5QK", "B004SIP9Z6", "B007WZTMCI", "B0007DFJ0G", "B000093FLA", "B0073U2FB2", "0783225814", "B000K7VHQ4", "B001OQCVI8", "B00011CZRE", "B000P0J0AQ", "B00000JSJC", "B0000AXE8I", "B008JFUQZ2", "B007X4ECMI", "B002ZG97CO", "B00AZMFJYA", "B008JFUO36", "B004P2VQZC", "B0000AC8LR", "B0045HCJT4", "B00J5LXT6M", "B00AEFY5B6", "B002UZCJ8Y", "B001GZ6QC4", "B00177Y9ZC", "B003UESJHO", "B000XA5K48", "B001DJLD1M", "B008JFUN50", "B005LAIHXQ", "B00K7IPFSM", "B0006IIPIK", "B005LAII8A", "B0013PSTMC", "B008JFUNHI", "B001L57ZYM", "B002QEHPQU", "B0034G4ORC", "B004SIP95G", "0767802519", "B001TOD92C", "B008JFUS0U", "B000087F6L", "B0051MKNV8", "B007WXUVHU", "B005LAIH2C", "B000R9U3B0", "B004LWZW7E", "B000MZHW40", "B00005JNJV", "B00005JPD0", "B000GGSMC6", "B0000ACOXL", "B0085A9HU6", "B009YQJ322", "B003Y5H5GK", "B009MO57H6", "B004LWZW4M", "0800195175", "B002QW7ALM", "B00005JMA8", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B001EAWMGA", "B002O3Z4WU", "B000BW7QWW", "B001GUYB08", "B00005V9HH", "B001UV4XWY", "B00A8MGIZG", "B002GSXKNI", "B00IARA8KM", "B004LWZWGA", "B00005JA8B", "B001QTXM5Y"], "bought_together": ["B000LC55F2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0007Y08QA", "B006ZL1PGG", "B000LC55F2", "B004P7CMJG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 61424}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.34, "brand": "Dimension", "asin": "B00005JLWN", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51K2WVH130L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Equilibrium"}

{"description": "There are two audiences for this DVD compilation of the first season of the enormously popular TV seriesMurder, She Wrote. The first enjoys the classic pleasures of the pre-forensics \"whodunit,\" stories in which murder was not so much a crime as a logic puzzle; the joy here lay in how skillfully a writer could misdirect you.Murder, She Wrote--in which mystery writer Jessica Fletcher constantly stumbles across dead bodies in every setting imaginable, from a San Francisco drag show to a football field--doesn't have the elegance of an Agatha Christie or Rex Stout mystery, but the show was efficient at laying out its clues and cunningly used the audience's familiarity with television itself (the relative star power of the guests, the need for a dramatic high point before every commercial break, etc.) to mislead and manipulate. And of course Angela Lansbury, as Fletcher, was an ideal television presence: Warm and friendly, but with just a hint of the fierce, steely will she revealed inThe Manchurian Candidate. Lansbury drove the show through an impressive twelve seasons (for which she received twelve Emmy nominations), plus multiple TV movies after its cancellation.The other audience forMurder, She Wrote: The Complete First Seasonconsists of viewers for whom names like Bert Convy, Dack Rambo, and Barbara Babcock send waves of guilty pleasure down their spines. The promotional materials for this boxed set make much ado about brief appearances by stars-to-be like Andy Garcia (who appears briefly as \"1st White Tough\" in the pilot TV movie) and Joaquin Phoenix (who's around 10 years old and still going by the name Leaf), but every single episode is a festival of B-, C-, and Z-grade celebrities from the 1970s and '80s:  Claude Akins, Tom Bosley, Jeff Conaway, David Doyle, Samantha Eggar, Lynda Day George, Morgan Brittany, Belinda Montgomery, Gabe Kaplan, and Lyle Waggoner, just to name a handful. Some of these names may be forgotten, but their faces (and scenery-chewing performances) will spark a Proustian rush of television memories.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000B5XSVM", "B00H4ZEJCO", "B000KGH00C", "B00H4ZEJ6K", "B0012EM5EW", "B000MQCUJ6", "B004Z74X0M", "B000GW8UAO", "B0011UF79M", "B000TXPXCS", "B0021FP3PO", "B001GMH8WO", "B006CR2OWM", "B003ZJ0POO", "B00HV0TJM2", "B001KZVQJS", "B0002COTDA", "B002UOMGX8", "B000F48D0U", "B00H4ZEJAG", "B00005JO3P", "B000IHYXJO", "B000BGR1B4", "B007V4QLWE", "B0025X4PAQ", "B00L4K450G", "B003IB0FTE", "B000O59A52", "B00005JMHI", "B000ASDFIG", "B000UAE7VS", "B00ALTQRNO", "B000HT3Q1Y", "B005TTEG5W", "B000NOIX6G", "B0019F030M", "0451194756", "B004DCM5RC", "B002ZTLVXY", "B0007CNY4K", "B000VDDDZA", "B0007Y3XRG", "B00EI3XANO", "B00H3L86F0", "B00E8AVN9U", "B00IWS74TM", "B0042RJWTW", "B002XKKX8E", "B005X5XINI", "B00AMU8K8C", "B0002ERWVE", "B0002W4SX6", "B000GW8UAE", "B005HWAOH0", "B00EJSMOO4", "B00005JLIC", "B00IWS74O2", "B003KSO3R0", "B005TFVM0I", "B00EI3X9Z8", "B00IXXVCT4", "B00IWS74WO", "B000BOH8YG", "B00HV0OEYU", "B00363WGJG", "B0007LXP86", "B001E6HUWK", "B00598OA7W", "B000N2HD6O", "B004HHX9H8", "B006IRQUIA", "B000Q6GUSE", "B00DZP1C0O", "B003YLM78U", "B00005JNHU", "B008K1PWMW", "B00ESG43AU", "B001V7UX4O", "B00005JO4F", "B00A0HT99G", "B000YKYT1M", "B0009NZ36O", "B000BF0C8E", "B0009S4IN8", "B001UDPA9C", "B00ESG5AD4", "B0014FAIVG", "B00KB01OG8", "B001JNNDRY", "B000XJD3K2", "B001675ZJM", "B0049GYXBS", "B000M343AS", "B00BW4S87A", "B000E5KQMI", "B00KB01N4G", "B00BUWD7NE", "B002OID512", "B001JTRKHW", "B001QUXNQG"], "bought_together": ["B000B5XSVM", "B00H4ZEJCO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00E8AVN9A", "B00H4ZEJCO", "B00H4ZEJ6K", "B00E8AVN9U"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 27340}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 19.24, "brand": "UNI DIST CORP.

{"description": "Guilty pleasures don't come more guilty thanThe A-Team, television's only tongue-in-cheek drama about the exploits of renegade Vietnam vets. The primetime series' 1983 debut season, gathered here onThe A-Team: Season One, was intentionally ludicrous, encouraging viewers to enjoy sundry talents of a colorful cast and laugh off storylines perhaps sillier than those onCharlie's Angels. Co-created by Stephen J. Cannell (Wiseguy) and Frank Lupo (Hunter),The A-Teamintroduced Lt. Col. John \"Hannibal\" Smith (George Peppard), the cocksure leader of a band of fugitive American soldiers framed for a crime in Vietnam and now thriving in Los Angeles. Hiring themselves out as soldiers of fortune, Hannibal's crew--including Lt. Templeton \"Face\" Peck (baby-faced Tim Dunigan in the pilot, Dirk Benedict thereafter), Sgt. Bosco Albert \"B.A. (for 'Bad Attitude')\" Baracus (Mr. T, outfitted with his trademark gold), and, most comically, Capt. H.M. \"Howling Mad\" Murdock (Dwight Schultz)--assist (mostly) ordinary people having a problem with bad guys. The A-Team ostensibly charges large fees, but much of the time the guys seem to be doing pro bono work for the helpless.Season Onehighlights include \"Children of Jamestown,\" starring John Saxon as a Jim Jones-like religious cult leader who captures Hannibal, Face, B.A., and first-season sidekick Amy \"Triple A\" Allen (Melinda Culea). While the resourceful group invents a super-weapon out of farm equipment, crazy Murdock commandeers a helicopter and dynamite. Also good is \"A Small and Deadly War,\" featuring Dean Stockwell as one of several uncontrolled L.A. cops committing murder-for-hire. \"The Out-of-Towners\" takes a page from theDeath Wishmovie series with a story about New York City shop owners harassed by a protection racketeer (Yaphet Kotto). Hannibal and company retaliate with machine guns (no one is ever seen killed in this series) and, more effectively, public humiliation of the villain. The best thing aboutThe A-Teamis the relationship between the four offbeat heroes, who may not always like each other (B.A. usually looks as if he'd like to leave Murdock in a shallow grave) but get the job done expertly.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0007LXP7W", "B000E5KQLY", "B000BUE5CI", "B000GW8U9U", "B00DGNFMNS", "B00DGNFMJW", "B00DGNFMMY", "B00HUPC5QU", "B00FWMVVJ0", "B000BUE5D2", "B000E5KQM8", "B0024FAD7Y", "B0072BNKIO", "B0006IUDXA", "B002ZG994U", "B0007YMWFK", "B0007Y08SS", "B000BGR1B4", "B005LFQRTC", "B000IONJI8", "B00HZMZ286", "B000BB1MJ6", "B000N2HD6O", "B004UV3KS4", "B0006BAWR4", "B002WQ79A4", "B0009S4IM4", "B000LXGXY8", "B000N4RAQA", "B000XJD3K2", "B000BF0C8E", "B001JFKWE4", "B000GTLB4Y", "B00005JMHI", "B000ERVJMC", "B00005JOJR", "B0009W5J3M", "B000BDH6DK", "B000EMG90O", "B00555ZTQK", "B000O77SNG", "B00G3BRC24", "B0007XG26G", "B000PFUANC", "B000FDDYPA", "B000MLWQ6I", "B008OR5X6M", "B000ERVJKY", "B00962R0H4", "B000MLWQ6S", "B000CNESLW", "B00KHA9BQ2", "B004UV3KSY", "B003L77FWA", "B000HLDF9U", "B000OVLMKC", "B0012EM5EW", "B00JEZWRE4", "B0006N2EZK", "B000IHYXIK", "B00DYQ1G78", "B004UV3KSE", "B000SQFC2M", "B00HQLZCIQ", "B00DXLO0D6", "B0009JE6FC", "B00F4CIPRE", "B00HRUQ8YS", "B00BWQU0RY", "B0089BSLKS", "B002L9N4O2", "B000FSME1K", "B000NOIX7K", "B00005JLEY", "B0006BAWSI", "B005ZVIMUE", "B000LE16VC", "B00GOC75YW", "B0011FLGZQ", "B0014VPFM2", "B0007KIFK0", "B000GW8UAE", "B00A33J8FM", "B0025VKX04", "B001J2XROY", "B00HW3L9MG", "B004M9ZI0C", "B00DD56724", "B00005JM3A", "B003L77FWU", "B00BB8LU5Y", "B0025KVTLW", "B0006Z2KZ2", "B000CCBCK8", "B0002Y4T7O", "B000M343B2", "B0049GYXCW", "B003W5C0TY", "B00ESK1PES", "B0028S1100"], "bought_together": ["B0007LXP7W", "B000E5KQLY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0007LXP7W", "B000GW8U9U", "B000E5KQLY", "B00DGNFMJW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 70093}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 22.16, "brand": "", "asin": "B00005JN80", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/512DFJG09VL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The A-Team - Season One"}
{"description": "Like a good dream, Sofia Coppola'sLost in Translationenvelops you with an aura of fantastic light, moody sound, head-turning love, and a feeling of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu, even though you've probably never been to this neon-fused version of Tokyo. Certainly Bob Harris has not. The 50-ish actor has signed on for big money shooting whiskey ads instead of doing something good for his career or his long-distance family. Jetlagged, helplessly lost with his Japanese-speaking director, and out of sync with the metropolis, Harris (Bill Murray, never better) befriends the married but lovelorn 25-year-old Charlotte (played with heaps of poise by 18-year-old Scarlett Johansson). Even before her photographer husband all but abandons her, she is adrift like Harris but in a total entrapment of youth. How Charlotte and Bill discover they are soul mates will be cherished for years to come. Written and directed by Coppola (The Virgin Suicides), the film is far more atmospheric than plot-driven: we whiz through Tokyo parties, karaoke bars, and odd nightlife, always ending up in the impossibly posh hotel where the two are staying. The wisps of bittersweet loneliness of Bill and Charlotte are handled smartly and romantically, but unlike modern studio films, this isn't a May-November fling film. Surely and steadily, the film ends on a much-talked-about grace note, which may burn some, yet awards film lovers who \"always had Paris\" with another cinematic destination of the heart.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305428239", "B0007UC8Y4", "B000BX8R10", "B00005JMJG", "B0000640VJ", "B0010X8NF0", "B003UESJLU", "B007L6VR12", "0767821408", "B00007AJF8", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B00DW5IKYS", "B001QOGYBI", "B000M06KJ8", "B00005JLRE", "B00000G02H", "B0006TPE4C", "B0007TKOAA", "B00AEFXESQ", "B00DYVUBYM", "B00H9HZITU", "B000Z8GZYW", "B004SEUIXS", "B00AEFXN9G", "B003CRM6PA", "B00008RH3J", "B000EQHXNW", "B0001I1K32", "B0008JIJ2O", "B001DJ7PR8", "B0007DFJ0G", "B0009PVZD2", "B000CS464G", "B00337KM2S", "B003102JDM", "0790734796", "B001P3SA8K", "B00JJ3EHCG", "B0000WN0SC", "B00003CWTI", "B00003CXZ4", "B00008975Z", "B0057ZAA6W", "B000IU37SO", "B00004RJ73", "B00AEFXGIY", "B007P9HW3M", "B005MYEQ4U", "B000K7VHQE", "B00005JNC2", "B00079Z9VO", "B000063JDE", "B0001US61O", "B0000WN15O", "B00G7QPXUI", "B0041KKYEM", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00006LPGP", "B0006H32EI", "B00005JKJA", "B00AEFYCL4", "B000KX0IOK", "B002T9H2LA", "B001TOD92C", "B004XVMCKS", "B00AEBB9CS", "B008220DGE", "0767802519", "B000069HYF", "B007D5E7C2", "B000M7XRAG", "B004U7MR14", "B003O7I6SE", "B000A7DVR2", "B005LAIIJY", "B00A81MV3U", "B000055Y0X", "B00005V9HH", "B000E33VWW", "0783225903", "B00AEFXE9U", "B000N6TX1I", "B00CIOD6HK", "B0021L8UOY", "B004SIP95G", "B000PAAJZ6", "B002ZG980U", "B007UW9WOQ", "B00GKOJ98E", "B0014D5RBE", "B00011CZRE", "B001HN699A", "B000M4RG7E", "B003ELKNH2", "0767802535", "B00121QGPY", "B004FQX5B6", "6305609764", "B0009A40ES"], "bought_together": ["B0007UC8Y4", "6305428239"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00JAQJMJ0", "B007L6VR12", "B001QOGYBI", "B0010X8NF0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 2901}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.77, "brand": "Universal Studios", "asin": "B00005JMJ4", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518vLN4%2B7KL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Lost in Translation"}
{"description": "That adorable Audrey Tautou fromAm&#xE9;lieplays the central role in this deceptive story of a rather unusual romance. It would spoil the film's clever design to reveal what happens halfway throughHe Loves Me, He Loves Me Not, so let's just say that Tautou plays a winsome girl in the sunny town of Bordeaux, whose relationship with a married doctor has more layers than first it seems. Samuel LeBihan, fromBrotherhood of the Wolf, plays the doctor, but it's the casting of cutie-pie Tautou that sets up the movie's gradually sinister undertow. Director Laetitia Colombani's inventive structure plays a satisfyingly tricky game with the audience, and may have some viewers going back to the beginning to make sure they saw what they thought they saw.

The slickly (natch) produced making-of documentary goes through the standard routine; however, the less-flashy \"fly on the wall\" bits--just showing what happens on set without comment--is more fun, offering effortless insight on the filmmaking process. The best treasure is a nifty interactive history on pirates with plenty of background material. You can simply play the filmed segments or take a tour around a ship to discover the material (and a few surprises). There's a lot of archival material on the theme-park ride that inspired the film and several odds and ends including an enjoyable chronicle of the vintage ship's voyage from its home harbor to the movie set. The kids should really dig the DVD-ROM \"Moonlight Becomes Ye,\" in which they can turn their own mug into a ghostly pirate. There's also a bounty of extended and deleted scenes (19 in all) and a very funny blooper reel. With both DTS and Dolby 5.1, sound systems will get a workout with the excellent (and loud) sound design.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000I0RQVI", "B000U7WV1Y", "B005COPWZW", "B004A8ZWUQ", "B00005JN5E", "B0013BM63O", "B006VRRGNK", "B00005JKZV", "B00005JPH2", "B0014Z4OMU", "B00E5I2MCM", "B00003CWT6", "B004DTLK80", "B00005JKZY", "B0000A1RJI", "B004M1A21K", "B004DTLK7G", "B00003CXZ1", "B001HN694K", "B001E75QH0", "B00E5I2M6I", "B00005JKCH", "B0087ZG7HK", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B000E6EK2Y", "B000E8M0VA", "B003UYUQZW", "B00AEFYGBA", "B000W746GK", "B00005JMQW", "B0083SBMBM", "B001DHXT20", "B0002234LS", "B000W7F5SS", "B002PMV9FG", "B0002KVUKM", "B004EPYZUS", "B0053FANRC", "B00BEZTMFY", "6304806434", "B000VR0570", "0783231644", "B001OQCV6A", "B000AYELVA", "B008JFUO72", "B005G4TJUC", "B00004R99S", "B00023B1LC", "B00E5I2M9K", "B00003CXI1", "B001HQZJMU", "B00000IRE6", "B0002ZDVEU", "B008QE9XD2", "B00F84H73Q", "B00E5I2MEK", "B003Y5H5EW", "B007K3JFUQ", "B003QO8TOQ", "B000NQRR1Q", "B000YPUF9W", "B001EZE5BU", "B004A8ZWSS", "B0009MDPYM", "B00LG6YEKE", "B002ZG980U", "B002ZG994U", "B000U1ZV8K", "B001DZ8TRW", "B00005JLR2", "B000VWYJ86", "B00AZMFJYA", "B001GZ6QC4", "B00000JQB5", "B004XKCZAG", "B000W796OM", "B001GCUO0W", "B00AQSN7HE", "B00000ILDH", "B0053FANT0", "B0000VAFO0", "B0002IQMAM", "B000HRMAPE", "B004LWZW7Y", "B008UZA8FY", "B0001HLVS2", "B00007AJGH", "B00005JNJV", "B003YAR97K", "B00CHVJODE", "B000UR9T8C", "B0049IHX2C", "B000G6BLW4", "B00177YA1K", "0783227345", "B0014Z4ON4", "B001TK80C0", "B002O5M4T4", "B00AEBBA72", "B00005JOC9"], "bought_together": ["B000I0RQVI", "B000U7WV1Y"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005COPWZW", "B000I0RQVI", "B0071JADFU", "B00005JPFX"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 6260}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.23, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B00005JM5E", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51fX40gGdXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)"}

This powerful, ultimately triumphant film follows Szpilman's heroic and inspirational journey of survival with the unlikely help from a sympathetic German officer (Thomas Kretschmann).

{"description": "There's a pretty good gimmick with these DVD extras aimed squarely at the pre-teen/early teen audience that ate up this film. Each of the extras (a standard making-of featurette, an alternate ending, and an interesting deleted scene) is followed by a clue afterwards. Decipher the clues and unlock the next set of extras: a nice bit on real treasure hunters, an awful piece on the Knights Templar, and one gem for kids: \"Riley Poole's Decode this!\" Actor Justin Bartha reprises his role (Nic Cage's techno-sidekick) and lectures a bit on the cooler side of language history and code-breaking with a few simple interactive games. If you get through it all, you unlock a hidden feature, a trivia track. Thankfully, those who do not want to go on the treasure hunt can access these features by reading the printed insert.

{"description": "With the slimmest extras package for a Pixar film debuting on DVD,Carsstill shines for home viewing. As with earlier digital-to-digital transfers, the film sounds and looks stunning. There is only one behind-the-scenes feature, a 16-minute cursory but entertaining glance at director John Lasseter's influences (his dad was a car-parts manager), including some of the real-life inspiration for the film such as Michael Wallis's influential book on Route 66 (he also voiced the sheriff). There's a new cartoon for the DVD, \"Mater and Ghost Light,\" which is smile-inducing at best. Four deleted scenes (in storybook format with voices) also show a darker tone the movie may have taken at one point. Best is the adorable short \"One Man Band\" that showed theatrically with the film, and the film's credit sequence can be seen full screen without the credits (and find the Easter egg for an extended version).

{"description": "More than a few critics hailedSpider-Man 2as \"the best superhero movie ever,\" and there's no compelling reason to argue--thanks to a bigger budget, better special effects, and a dynamic, character-driven plot, it's a notch aboveSpider-Manin terms of emotional depth and rich comic-book sensibility.Ordinary PeopleOscar-winner Alvin Sargent received screenplay credit, and celebrated author and comic-book expert Michael Chabon worked on the story, but it's director Sam Raimi's affinity for the material that bringsSpidey 2to vivid life. When a fusion experiment goes terribly wrong, a brilliant physicist (Alfred Molina) is turned into Spidey's newest nemesis, the deranged, mechanically tentacled \"Doctor Octopus,\" obsessed with completing his experiment and killing Spider-Man (Tobey Maguire) in the process. Even more compelling is Peter Parker's urgent dilemma: continue his burdensome, lonely life of crime-fighting as Spider-Man, or pursue love and happiness with Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst)? Molina's outstanding as a tragic villain controlled by his own invention, and the action sequences are nothing less than breathtaking, but the real success ofSpider-Man 2is its sense of priorities. With all of Hollywood's biggest and best toys at his disposal, Raimi and his writers stay true to the Marvel mythology, honoringSpider-Mancreators Stan Lee and Steve Ditko, and setting the bar impressively high for the challenge ofSpider-Man 3.--Jeff ShannonDVD Features:The first commentary track is by director Sam Raimi and a self-deprecating Tobey Maguire speaking in tandem, and producer (and Marvel CEO) Avi Arad and coproducer Grant Curtis speaking in tandem. They discuss a number of topics, including Raimi's memory of his excitement over Richard Donner's Superman and how the character of Black Cat had to be dropped from the film. The second commentary is by six members of the Oscar-nominated effects team, and one of their primary focuses is how Doc Ock's arms were achieved by a combination of puppetry and CGI.The centerpiece of the second disc is a massive two-hour documentary that can be viewed all at once or in 12 separate pieces. It covers the development of the story, the visual effects, costumes, stunts, and sound and music. Three shorter featurettes cover Peter Parker's struggle between his personal and hero lives, Doc Ock, and the women in Spider-Man's life, and what's interesting is how they discuss those topics not just in relation to the movies but to the comic books as well. (For example, Betty Brant and Gwen Stacy had a much greater impact in the comics.) There's a scene in which you can toggle among three different camera angles, and a gallery of 17 paintings Alex Ross created for the opening sequence. The sound and picture are spectacular, though only theSuperbit editionhas DTS.--David HoriuchiMore Spiderman on DVDTheSpidermanToy StoreThe First FilmSpider Manon the small screenThe SoundtrackGame Boy AdvanceThe BookMore Superheroes on DVDBatmanBladeThe HulkJimmy NeutronJustice LeagueKim PossibleRobocopSpider-ManSupermanWonder WomanX-MenAlso see our Action & Adventure StoreStills fromSpider-Man 2(click for larger image)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000UR9T8C", "B00005JKCH", "B004LWZWFQ", "B001DHXT20", "B00E5I2MCM", "B00005JNTU", "B000VI70QS", "B001CDR1FG", "B001GCUO1Q", "B000AYELVA", "B00E5I2M6I", "B000AYELVU", "B008JFUO72", "B0083SBMBM", "B004LWZW42", "B004EPZ07K", "B00005JNJV", "B0002IQMAM", "B00E5I2MEK", "B000OVLBF8", "B00E5I2M9K", "B000HEVZ9E", "B008QZ5PY2", "B000HCO83Q", "B00JPS7HOA", "B001QB9H1U", "B00IGVJGYQ", "B0000959N0", "B0007P0Y7C", "B002GSXKN8", "B008JFUPFI", "B000J10EQU", "B0007V6ITE", "B0090SI56Y", "B001GZ6QC4", "6307397594", "B008JFUS0U", "B000IJ79VQ", "B000VR0570", "B002ZG99B8", "B00005JKWJ", "B004LWZWGA", "B005G4TJUC", "B002IPFWTE", "B00005JM5E", "B005LAIGW8", "0767817478", "B000H30B2C", "B002A5EBLW", "B0006L0LOS", "B000U7WV1Y", "B0000VCZLG", "B000P0J06K", "B002GSXKNI", "B002HWRYJE", "B0004Z33EQ", "B0009A409S", "B001DJLD2G", "B000I0RQVI", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B0007RT9MG", "B001GKJ2E8", "B0000AXE8I", "B007K3JFUQ", "B00004STUL", "B00BEZTMFY", "B000P0J06U", "B000957O82", "1402778007", "B0039N74CW", "B003UESJF6", "B00F4FFO8E", "B001HN697M", "B001OST0LW", "B0060FXDCG", "B0049IHX2C", "B000P0J0A6", "B000CEVC9M", "B000UVKGPI", "B009JBWOU0", "B00005JM5B", "B00I6JOD2S", "B001EDVNNU", "B000O77SRC", "B0000633UA", "B000P6XQ50", "B000E8M0VA", "B00008G8M4", "B000EGDB10", "B007REV4T8", "B00BPA2PEI", "B008Y1YK9Y", "B005OY6LBE", "0780624890", "B002935GMS", "0767803434", "6305428042", "B000O78KW4", "B009HIKAN8"], "bought_together": ["B000UR9T8C", "B00005JKCH"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004LWZWFQ", "B003YAR97K", "B00005JKCH", "B000UR9T8C"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 9593}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.0, "brand": "Marvel Kids", "asin": "B00005JMQW", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51529JJX43L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Spider-Man 2 (Widescreen Special Edition)"}
{"description": "When one thinks of cutting edge television,My Three Sonsdoes not immediately leap to mind, but this beloved Boomer-era staple (it ran for 12 seasons, which, for a family sitcom, is second in longevity only toThe Adventures of Ozzie & Harriet) broke the nuclear family mold. Fred MacMurray's Steve Douglas was a widower, raising his titular brood--college-bound Mike (Tim Considine), middle son Robbie (Don Grady), and youngest son Chip (Stanley Livingston)--with the help of his gruff, but soft-hearted father-in-law, Bub (William Frawley). In the first episode, when a door-to-door cosmetics salesman asks to see the woman of the house, Bub laughs, \"Boy, do you have the wrong house.\" Also not par for the sitcom course is the avant-garde use of sound effects. In one episode, sibling rivalry over a girl results in a \"cold war\" between Mike and Robbie. Their dinner table sniping as Steve tries to broker peace is punctuated by the sounds of guns firing and bombs exploding. Which is to say thatMy Three Sonshas aged nicely, and has much to offer beyond nostalgia. No offense to the great William Demarest, who replaced an ailing Frawley in 1965, but the series' \"Bub\" years were the best. Save for the episode in which comedian George Gobel is a guest at the house, the situations are grounded in reality, and the writing often surprises with twists that subvert sitcom convention and stereotypes. \"Countdown\" cleverly unfolds in real time as the family's Monday morning routine plays out against a televised satellite launch. In another episode, a fraternity rejects Mike, not because they are snobs (the usual sitcom portrayal), but because they believe Mike isn't serious enough about his education. Some episodes simply bring home the laughs, as in \"The Little Ragpicker,\" in which a realistic looking dummy causes a new neighbor to think the worst about the Douglases. But there is genuine pathos in \"Bub in the Ointment,\" in which Bub's \"Irish temper\" and lack of tact embarrass the kids, until Steve reminds Mike of the sacrifices Bub made to move in with the family after his daughter died. The boys talk, act, and fight like brothers, and Steve, while a pipe-puffing fount of sage fatherly advice, is sometimes at a loss, and is allowed to be testy and impatient with his \"wild bunch.\" The split season is unfortunate, but these inaugural 18 episodes are a healthy serving for those who want a taste of this iconic series.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001GMH8WE", "B002ZTLVYI", "B003DJKZ82", "B003DJKZ6Y", "B000FSMEB0", "B000EXZFS0", "B0012Q3SZ0", "B000E3L7EQ", "B002JODUES", "B001E6JC30", "B0063FGERO", "B000B7HZUK", "B0077T5SBS", "B00FM4S8IU", "B001992NXI", "B002AMVEHY", "B002ACKBU0", "B007ZKWMMM", "B001AZIRY0", "B005NHZAXM", "B000H1RFF0", "B0025X4PBA", "B001D2WUCA", "B001D5C1F8", "B009GGWW3W", "B000EQ5PTQ", "B00G5N6C8U", "B000H6SY28", "B005SQRYOG", "B0096RC57O", "B001SLNPSO", "B000MQ4WMY", "B005R2SHX8", "B0030BS1E8", "B00005JO4F", "B00005JLIC", "B008ZD4NI4", "B000EGDANO", "B008LC8RQ8", "B0007V6IWQ", "B00FJO95TE", "B000YKYT1M", "B0009B16TO", "B003JHXS5A", "B005BUA1F8", "B000HWZ4J8", "B00H8KC1N4", "B005SQRYRS", "B002XKKX8E", "B0019BI114", "B00AADAEHQ", "B00082ZROO", "B00JEZWRE4", "B00L1WJK2K", "B00KTZALDC", "B001992NZG", "B0002NY8PI", "B00008EYBH", "B00HXH5WNI", "B001LRL4Y2", "B003IB0FSU", "B000E3L7FK", "B0009NZMYC", "B000EHSVB4", "B0000V4906", "B007R5S0YY", "B002OOWL16", "B00GV8B1BM", "B005DLN1LG", "B000HIVIOM", "B00009VRF0", "B001O4KBP0", "B000SMNK16", "B0007Z9QXK", "B002OOWKVM", "B00274SIVK", "B0050MB5AC", "B009OE2ODY", "B00GHH9HW2", "B0089BSLKS", "B003N2JKY4", "B001BN4WHW", "B000LPR6AG", "B001DHXT66", "B00650RWGO", "B001RXDM22", "B004KDYR5W", "B009DH36ZC", "B00553K9NA", "B000LV6VZQ", "B002WIDRLC", "B000ASDFIQ", "B000WPJT2I", "B000E33VZ4", "B005QAGBXO", "B001CO42LQ", "B00650RWZA", "B00CDV4Q9A", "B000TGJ88A", "B00JAD6BYW"], "bought_together": ["B001GMH8WE", "B002ZTLVYI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001GMH8WE", "B000EXZFS0", "B000FSMEB0", "B003DJKZ82"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 81153}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 20.94, "brand": "MY", "asin": "B00005JOEB", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51izY0dL7QL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "My Three Sons: Season 1, Vol. 1"}

With Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore at the keyboard and Marc Lawrence (Two Weeks Notice) directing, Music and Lyrics is a witty, wacky romantic comedy that faces the music...and laughs!", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00008NRI7", "B00005JPSM", "B0038N9X3Q", "B00006ZXSL", "B004SIP9RO", "B000MQC9H4", "B00005JL7Q", "B000023VTP", "B002ZG988M", "B000CCBCAS", "B000M5B6Q0", "B000ELJAEM", "B0009OL7Z4", "B004SEUJK0", "B00006ZXSO", "B004SIP8JI", "B000YDBPAM", "B000A0GXRO", "B0021L8UZS", "B001WAKOW6", "B00008G7UF", "B00EIBO8T6", "B000BNX3B4", "B003B3V0N4", "B002TQKL7K", "6304765266", "B00006ZXSK", "B00AEBB8YW", "B002K0WBXW", "B0015I2RT8", "B003Y5H574", "B004SIP8LG", "B002ZG97QK", "B002ZG989G", "B00AEBB8NS", "B0001Z3TXE", "B003BV8ICC", "0780625277", "B000HEWEE4", "B00005JLZW", "B00164KYV4", "B00AKGG6JS", "B004SIP9VA", "B0000897EG", "B0011N1WE8", "B002ZFEQ76", "B00AEFYWQY", "B00AEBB9M8", "B001AKTZW8", "B0049TC88U", "B00AEFY99O", "B00008G7UI", "B000RETOGA", "B002OVED88", "B00003CXSM", "B000XJD33O", "B000OCZA04", "B000058TLQ", "B000EMGICS", "B0071HPOGK", "B004LWZW9C", "B004EPZ070", "B002P413IC", "B003EYVXXC", "B002ZG9968", "B00AEFYQE2", "B00006ZXSN", "B000VE4UHO", "B001Y8DJVE", "B003Y5H524", "B0002I84N0", "B00561BNI6", "B0038N9WKU", "B00015YVD6", "B001C5LLQ4", "0783235380", "B004IK30PA", "B00003CXGA", "B005XB8SRS", "B00007E2F5", "B000HCPS94", "6305236569", "B00AEFXYOA", "B000J4QW7W", "B000A343RI", "B00447L4KA", "076784744X", "B0000ARD7O", "B001OQCUZM", "B00AG473GE", "B00015YVI6", "B00006FMUW", "B00DW5ILUG", "B002WEEYIQ", "B00DCG36LO", "B00AEFXWXI", "B0000AOV4I", "B000N4SHOE", "B00005V5NS"], "bought_together": ["B0038N9X3Q"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B008MIMWQC", "B000023VTP", "B0038N9X3Q", "B0021L8UZS"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 13931}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.98, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00005JPE3", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51vp3TIoerL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Music and Lyrics (Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "The supercharged possibilities of a single set and two amped-up actors are explored inHard Candy, a twisted cocktail with a poison kicker. After a flirtatious encounter in an online chat room, two people agree to meet for coffee:  a 32-year-old man (Patrick Wilson) and a 14-year-old girl (Ellen Page). They quickly advance to his house, and just as quickly, the apparent pedophilic seduction morphs into something else entirely. After the tables turn,Hard Candybecomes a tale of revenge and torture that might have tempted a filmmaker like Park Chanwook. Here, first-time feature director David Slade opts for a slick look that stays close to the actors, and you can't really blame him--this movie is like a conceptual, more-than-slightly unbelievable off-Broadway play, a showcase for actors and \"controversial\" ideas. Those actors are strong:  Patrick Wilson (Angels in America,Phantom of the Opera) is every bit as creepy as he needs to be, and Ellen Page has nothing short of a triumph. The Canadian actress was around 18 when she shot the film, but looks like an adolescent, which makes her authoritative wrath all the more shocking to witness. The provocations ofHard Candysometimes seem arbitrary or forced, but Page's electrifying performance can't be denied, or dismissed.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0017VG5XM", "B00177YA6U", "B002VPTJOA", "B000ARFPMQ", "B004U7MR3W", "B0037E8HOC", "B00DVD5STQ", "B000YABYLA", "B00187FPC2", "B001MEJY8W", "B000WC38EQ", "B0013D8L7M", "B002EOVXBK", "B000FVQM2Y", "B000UCD4L0", "B00009MEC4", "B0051PLQR0", "6305313687", "B001G9CNI6", "B005Z9MGRG", "B003U6SJY0", "B008NNY8XQ", "B00125WATQ", "B0014VPFVS", "B00006AUIG", "B00DMUFXOS", "B001J4E19C", "B002VPTJNQ", "B00000I1KK", "B003L20IEC", "B004OUZLGK", "B000N3SU92", "B00699G622", "B00005Q4CS", "B0057ZAA6W", "B00005JMJG", "B008G1JIQC", "B0021L8UPS", "B00441GYVK", "B0007PID84", "B000NO39FG", "B00B96TGQS", "B001B187L6", "B000OYCMLM", "B005SQRYB4", "B0000AOX0A", "B000A2X3U2", "B00G5GNYY2", "B008G33PIM", "B0020LH8WU", "6305428484", "B000MMMTBY", "B002LMSWN2", "B007CZ3E7C", "B002USF1WC", "B004SIP9Z6", "B00005U14H", "0767802519", "B00AEFY2AA", "B0001GF2D8", "B001D2WU9I", "B00009W0U4", "B0000694XX", "B004LWZW24", "B0083QN87K", "B004Z1HY2W", "B000HC2LFI", "B0002J4X1Q", "B0000CABGW", "B007L6VRBM", "B0001EFUFK", "B003626TNG", "B009XTF8KQ", "B00ELQHX5O", "B007UW9W8W", "B001JNNDJM", "157362408X", "B0058ZPNOK", "B000EOTVU2", "B0082CWTSY", "B00AZTUUQK", "B001C5LLVE", "B000PKG8TM", "B00003CWQR", "B00007976U", "B001CDFY64", "B004XVMCH6", "B00003CWN3", "B0028DRGDQ", "B000FS2W3A", "B001U0HBQA", "B000N3AW6G", "B00005QAOZ", "B00BSU0FQA", "B00003CXKM", "B0002MPQRS", "B00BEIYGT8", "B0004Z31OS", "B001AZKB8K"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002VPTJOA", "B00177YA6U", "B001MEJY8W", "B0017VG5XM"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 421858}, "asin": "B00005JP3W", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51FEBBE1B9L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Hard Candy"}

{"description": "This two-disc collector's edition ofPirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chestis packed with over five hours of special features that delve into everything from creating the mythology-inspired Davy Jones and Kraken figures, to working and planning without a completed script, the incredible CGI techniques used in the film, the intense sword training sessions and stunt work, and the unpredictability of filming on location in the Caribbean. The audio commentary by writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio is an interesting and insightful look into the finished film, but perhaps even more revealing is the 25-minute \"Charting the Return\" preproduction diary in which everyone from producer Jerry Bruckheimer to associate director Peter Kohn and writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio give a sense of the enormity of the project of concurrently writing and filming two sequels toPirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl. The overwhelming logistics of planning and casting without a finished script, scouting and preparing remote locations, constructing a new Black Pearl, and functional props like the rolling water wheel, and cutting costs to stay within budget are nothing less than mind-boggling. In the hourlong \"According to Plan\" feature, director Gore Verbinski, producer Jerry Bruckheimer, and a host of others detail the enormity of the project, focusing on the stamina involved in a 200-day shooting schedule and the need for adaptability and flexibility in dealing with everything from behind schedule excavations to the logistics of shooting on moving water and even the natural fury of a full-blown hurricane.  Shorter featurettes \"Meet Davy Jones: Anatomy of a Legend\" and \"Creating the Kraken\" focus on the mythological creatures in the film and the awesome visual effects and advances in CGI technology that made them possible.  \"Mastering the Blade\" follows Orlando Bloom (Will Turner), Keira Knightley (Elizabeth Swann), and Jack Davenport (Norrington) through some intense sword-fighting training sessions and \"Fly on the Set: The Bone Cage\" offers a frightening look at what it was like to shoot the bone cage scene of the movie.  Other bonus features include bloopers, an interactive tour of Johnny Depp's special makeup effects and wardrobe details, a look at how the 1967 Disney Land Pirates of the Caribbean ride was recently \"re-imagineered\" to incorporate some of the characters and elements from the new movies, producer Jerry Bruckheimer's photo diary, and a glimpse of the glitzy June 24, 2006 red carpet premiere on Disney Land's main street.--Tami Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000U7WV1Y", "B00005JM5E", "B005COPWZW", "B004A8ZWUQ", "B0013BM63O", "B00005JN5E", "B004M1A21K", "B004DTLK80", "B000VR0570", "B00005JKZV", "B00005JKZY", "B00005JKCH", "B001HN694K", "B00005JPH2", "B00AEFYGBA", "B00BEZTMFY", "B001HQZJMU", "B00E5I2M6I", "B006VRRGNK", "B001BEK8HO", "B000E8M0VA", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B001E75QH0", "B008QE9XD2", "B00E5I2MCM", "B00LG6YEKE", "B00AEBBA72", "B007K3JFUQ", "B000HRMAPE", "B0090SI56Y", "B000E6EK2Y", "B0053FANRC", "B00005JMQW", "B008Y1YK9Y", "B00177YA1K", "B001TK80C0", "B000UR9T8C", "B00003CXI1", "B004EPYZUS", "B00003CXTA", "B001OQCV6A", "B0014Z4ON4", "B005G4TJUC", "B000F7CECK", "B00HFFE8HE", "B001GCUO1Q", "B0087ZG7J8", "B003YAR97K", "B008JFUNTG", "B001GCUO0W", "B000NIBURQ", "B0053FANPY", "B00023B1LC", "B003QO8TOQ", "B002VPE1BQ", "B00F84H73Q", "B003Y5H54W", "B00003CWT6", "B00007AJGH", "B00E5I2M9K", "B000W7F5SS", "B0049IHX2C", "B00000IRE6", "B001F7MSFM", "B000AYELVA", "B002ZG9904", "B000VWYJ86", "B00CFA222M", "B003UYUQZW", "B008UZ949K", "B0002KVUKM", "B000209KMW", "B000UVKGPI", "B0087ZG7HK", "B0000WN140", "B001EZE5BU", "B002PMV9FG", "B000HT386M", "B000NQRR1Q", "B00003CXZ1", "630529142X", "B0002ZDVEU", "B004A8ZWSS", "B00005JM5B", "B000BTITKS", "B00E5I2MEK", "B002HWRYJE", "B001GZ6QC4", "B000W796OM", "B00AQSN7HE", "B0046BI81W", "B001VLBDD0", "B0060FXDCG", "B0084IG8TM", "B005OCFGTO", "B000OLGCIE", "B008JFUS0U", "B00007AJG4", "B009JBWOU0", "B001B3LIOC"], "bought_together": ["B000U7WV1Y", "B00005JM5E"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005COPWZW", "B00005JM5E", "B0071JADFU", "B00005JPFX"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 72898}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 16.95, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B00005JP0F", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GQE7TQ72L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)"}
{"description": "While much was made of the fact thatMarie Antoinetteelicited boos at Cannes, the many favorable reviews attracted less attention. Inspired by Antonia Fraser's biography, Sofia Coppola fashions a portrait that's just as dreamy asThe Virgin Suicides, her first literary adaptation, and the Oscar-winningLost in Translation. Set to a soundtrack of post-punk (a conceit that adds more interest than resonance), the teenaged Marie (Kirsten Dunst, quite good) may be shallow, but she's rarely unsympathetic. The story begins in the late-18th century as the Austrian Archduchess agrees to marry Louis-Auguste (Jason Schwartzman). After bidding adieu to her mother, Maria Theresa (Marianne Faithfull), she travels to France, where King Louis XV (Rip Torn) sets the rules--and the list is endless (Judy Davis' Comtesse de Noailles is the primary enforcer). As for the Dauphin, he's just a boy, really, with more interest in his key collection than their marriage bed. Should Marie produce an heir, it might be enough to sustain her--since life is nothing but an endless shopping spree--but clouds gather on the horizon as an impoverished populace rises up against their extravagant leaders. Coppola merely suggests what happens next, although history paints a darker picture. Filmed in and around the Chateau of Versailles,Marie Antoinetteis a riot of rustling gowns, sparkling jewels, and Manolo Blahnik-designed shoes. To say that style trumps substance does its maker a disservice, but the look of the thing does leave the deepest impression.--Kathleen C.

Told from the vertiginous point-of-view of a camcorder-wielding group of friends,Cloverfieldbegins like a primetime television soap opera about young Manhattanites coping with changes in their personal lives. Rob (Michael Stahl-David) is leaving New York to take an executive job at a company in Japan. At his goodbye party in a crowded loft, Rob&#x92;s brother Jason (Mike Vogel) hands a camcorder to best friend Hud (T.J. Miller), who proceeds to tape the proceedings over old footage of Rob&#x92;s ex-girlfriend, Beth (Odette Yustman)--images shot during happy times in that now-defunct relationship. Naturally, Beth shows up at the party with a new beau, bumming Rob out completely. Just before one's eyes glaze over from all this heartbreaking stuff (captured by Hud, who's something of a doofus, in laughably shaky camerawork), the unexpected happens: New York is suddenly under attack from a Godzilla-like monster stomping through midtown and destroying everything and everybody in sight. Rob and company hit the streets, but rather than run with other evacuees, they head toward the center of the storm so that Rob can rescue an injured Beth. There are casualties along the way, but the journey into fear is fascinating and immediate if emotionally remote--a consequence of seeing these proceedings through the singular, subjective perspective of a camcorder and of a story that intentionally leaves major questions unanswered: Who or what is this monster? Where did it come from? The lack of a backstory, and spare views of the marauding creature, are clever ways by producer J.J. Abrams and director Matt Reeves to keep an audience focused exclusively on what&#x92;s on the screen.  But it also makesCloverfieldcuriously uninvolving. Ultimately,Cloverfield, with its spectacular effects brilliantly woven into a home-video look, is a celebration of infinite possibilities in this age of accessible, digital media.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B004EPYZQ2", "B00IO9D3ZI", "B00EMMDMKM", "B002SJIO5E", "B0044ZOI32", "B001AR0D4A", "B004BZ5AMS", "B001MVYUQQ", "B003BJO8KU", "B0018AG6X6", "B005LAIGPU", "B00IO8VMB6", "B000PKG8SS", "B003Y5H5GU", "B00BPA2PGG", "B0017U7PT6", "B001YV502C", "B0013FBS20", "B008JFUR10", "B001KZVQJI", "B001CW7ZW6", "B0035WTJFW", "B000Y7U98W", "B003ABZGRI", "B000VDDWEC", "B000VDDWEM", "B002JT69IM", "B00164EAC8", "B002ZG981E", "B00AEFXORM", "B001DZOC3W", "B008SAPC20", "B003Y5H59M", "B00HERVMTK", "B00AVSFIV2", "B0032KNA4I", "B000L212HW", "B001FB55I0", "B0018O4YSQ", "B002ZG997M", "B002ZG9788", "B008G33O0G", "B000VDDWE2", "B00K2CHVSK", "B001GCUO5W", "B005J4TLQG", "B000PC6A3E", "B0027VT9ES", "B001F7MSG6", "B0051T46XM", "B00111YM60", "B001GZ6QEC", "B002HR1W1K", "B004SIPA4G", "B001OQCVII", "B001JNNDBA", "B001GKJ2FC", "B000WQWPKA", "B000OT6V00", "B0021L8UXK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004EPYZQ2", "B00IO8VMB6", "B004LWZW4W", "B005LAIHY0"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "asin": "B00005JPXY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Wm5GO98oL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Cloverfield [Theatrical Release]"}
{"description": "The 14-minute featurette \"Behind the Book: The Themes ofBridge to Terabithia\" discusses such topics as friendship and family as presented in both the book and the movie through interviews with the young lead actors, the book's author, Katherine Paterson, and several librarians and school teachers. Paterson and her son, producer-screenwriter David Paterson, also recall how an actual incident in David's life inspired the book. A six-minute visual-effects featurette looks at the film's creatures from sketch to computer design to screen, including how the features of the school kids helped shape the creatures. Josh Hutcherson and AnnaSophia Robb, \"chaperoned\" by producer Lauren Levine, recount their experiences on one commentary track, while the second, by director Gabor Csupo, writer Jeff Stockwell, and producer Hal Lieberman, is drier but informative. Topics covered include praise for young Bailee Madison, how Zooey Deschanel wouldn't have been considered a predator back in the '70s, and the somewhat-controversial marketing campaign that focused heavily on the film's fantasy elements.

{"description": "Nearly 20 years after riding his last Crusade, Harrison Ford makes a welcome return as archaeologist/relic hunter Indiana Jones inIndiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, an action-packed fourth installment that's, in a nutshell, less memorable than the first three but great nostalgia for fans of the series. Producer George Lucas and screenwriter David Koepp (War of the Worlds) set the film during the cold war, as the Soviets--replacing Nazis as Indy's villains of choice and led by a sword-wielding Cate Blanchett with black bob and sunglasses--are in pursuit of a crystal skull, which has mystical powers related to a city of gold. After escaping from them in a spectacular opening action sequence, Indy is coerced to head to Peru at the behest of a young greaser (Shia LaBeouf) whose friend--and Indy's colleague--Professor Oxley (John Hurt) has been captured for his knowledge of the skull's whereabouts. Whatever secrets the skull holds are tertiary; its reveal is the weakest part of the movie, as the CGI effects that inevitably accompany it feel jarring next to the boulder-rolling world of Indy audiences knew and loved. There's plenty of comedy, delightful stunts--ants play a deadly role here--and the return ofRaiderslove interest Karen Allen as Marion Ravenwood, once shrill but now softened, giving her ex-love bemused glances and eye-rolls as he huffs his way to save the day. Which brings us to Ford: bullwhip still in hand, he's a little creakier, a lot grayer, but still twice the action hero of anyone in film today. With all the anticipation and hype leading up to the film's release, perhaps no reunion is sweeter than that of Ford with the role that fits him as snugly as that fedora hat.--Ellen A.

{"description": "\"I bought a car. Turned out to be an alien robot. Who knew?\" deadpans Sam Witwicky, hero and human heart of Michael Bay's rollicking robot-smackdown fest,Transformers. Witwicky (the sweetly nerdy Shia LaBeouf, channeling a young John Cusack) is the perfect counterpoint to the nearly nonstop exhilarating action. The plot is simple: an alien civil war (the Autobots vs. the evil Decepticons) has spilled onto Earth, and young Sam is caught in the fray by his newly purchased souped-up Camaro. Which has a mind--and identity, as a noble-warrior robot named Bumblebee--of its own. The effects, especially the mind-blowing transformations of the robots into their earthly forms and back again, are stellar.Fans of the earlier film and TV series will be thrilled at this cutting-edge incarnation, but this version should please all fans of high-adrenaline action. Director Bay gleefully salts the movie with homages to pop-culture touchstones likeRaiders of the Lost Ark,King Kong, and the early technothrillerWarGames. The actors, though clearly all supporting those kickass robots, are uniformly on-target, including the dashing Josh Duhamel as a U.S. Army sergeant fighting an enemy he never anticipated; Jon Voight, as a tough yet sympathetic Secretary of Defense in over his head; and John Turturro, whose special agent manages to be confidently unctuous, even stripped to his undies. But the film belongs to Bumblebee, Optimus Prime, and the dastardly Megatron--and the wicked stunts they collide in all over the globe. Long live Transformers! --A.T. HurleyOn the DVDThe special edition ofTransformersis packed with extras (and more than a few product placements for Hasbro). The entire second disc is devoted to featurettes on aspects of making the technical tour-de-force--and the land mines involved in tinkering with a beloved '80s franchise. Executive producer Steven Spielberg is very much a part of the proceedings, from his introductory comments (\"I think everybody likes the idea of taking something you're familiar with and turning it into something you're not so familiar with--like an 18-wheeler become Optimus Prime\") to mentions of his films that influenced this one, likeE.T.andClose Encounters of the Third Kind.Director Michael Bay is brash and entertaining as he talks about his initial reluctance to take on the project, his indoctrination at \"Transformers U\" at Hasbro, and his enthusiasm for guerrilla-style action filmmaking. Star Shia LaBoeuf says, \"He is the sickest action director\" out there, and there's plenty of evidence here to support that. Other great highlights include features on how key scenes were shot, including the heart-pounding desert battle and the shootout in the streets of downtown L.A.--adrenaline-pumping stuff, even without the Transformers CGI'd in. --A.T.

{"description": "For anyone who thought the Oscar-winning documentaryMarch of the Penguinswas the most marvelous cinematic moment for these nomads of the south, you haven't seen nothing yet.Happy Feetis an animated wonder about a penguin named Mumble who can't sing, but can dance up a storm. George Miller, the driving force behind theBabe(andMad Max) movies, takes another creative step in family entertainment with this big, beautiful, music-fueled film that will have kids and their parents dancing in the streets. From his first moment alive, Mumble (voiced Elijah Woods) feels the beat and can't stop dancing. Unfortunately, emperor penguins are all about finding their own heart song, and the dancing youngster--as cute as he is--is a misfit. Luckily, he bumps into little blue penguins and a Spanish-infused group (led by Robin Williams) and begins a series of adventures. Miller has an exceptional variety of entertainment: Busby Berkley musical numbers, amusement-park thrills, exciting chase sequences (seals and orca lovers might like think otherwise), and even an environmental message that doesn't weigh you down. Best of all, you don't know where the movie is going in the last act, a rare occurrence these days in family entertainment. A fusion of rock songs, mashed-up and otherwise, are featured; this movie is as much a musical as a comedy. Mumble's solo dance to a new version of Stevie Wonder's \"I Wish\" by Fantasia, Patti, and Yolanda may be the most joyful moment on camera in 2006.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0006UEVT0", "B001DPHDCY", "B0006JMLRK", "B0012EM5D8", "B004HO6I4M", "B004EPZ0AC", "B002WJI2QQ", "B000AY74OG", "B0000AOX0O", "B00BG0RSJ4", "B00005JNQS", "B000RMJ4F8", "B0000640SC", "B005SDUV4E", "0783231474", "B00003CXJ4", "B00CWM58WY", "B0000VV4W2", "B0042U94UQ", "B0039N74CW", "6305161887", "B00AEFXMSS", "B000M343BC", "B00007LVCM", "B001ECQ75A", "B00005JNS0", "B00000JL8E", "B000GUJZ00", "B000056H26", "B008NNY9QW", "B004EPZ034", "B00G5G7EXY", "B000LPS2VI", "B005LAIH4A", "B00F522C7C", "B005LAIISA", "B00GDT5T9Y", "B007FF3HQM", "B000VBJEEG", "B003H9M1Q2", "B00029LO0Y", "B008JFUQ16", "B00005JMQZ", "B00EV1YZ96", "B000ION23A", "B0013FSL3E", "B003ZHVJGO", "B002ZG97YM", "B001NCDFTW", "B004G600A4", "B00009YXAW", "B005LAIHW2", "B00AFEX83C", "B00475B0H6", "B000UVKGPI", "B00ALMNCLQ", "B00HLTD2OE", "B00005JM7T", "B001HN6922", "B000BI5KV0", "B0013FSWT2", "B0030IIZ4M", "B004ODLUGM", "B001GCUO7A", "B005F96UJ6", "B000UFIYOO", "B000G75AZC", "B00005QFE1", "B0000VCZKW", "B00IEXX4KS", "B001THIQFO", "B000A2WAQK", "B001GCUNWQ", "B00B7EQPNE", "B002NZK5SW", "B0007PIDBQ", "B00AOCDDGC", "B000V5IP6U", "B0044RFTD8", "B00AEFXMGU", "B001KVZ6FW", "B00CHVJODE", "B000CZ0PT4", "B006JD48LO", "B0007Z0NYG", "B00EBBGLFC", "B00003CXB4", "B000BMGEJI", "B008YWY0HK", "B0002YLCOM", "B00E9ZATJO", "B004A8ZX3C", "B00I6JOD2S", "B005G3VCYY", "B00CQRN3QI", "B004OWQTZ0", "B0001OGUQI", "B004EPZ01G", "B00005JMFH", "B000GIXEWC"], "bought_together": ["B004HO6I4M"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004HO6I4M", "B00EBBGLFC", "B00G5G7EXY", "B00HR3D56O"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 21763}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.51, "brand": "Warner", "asin": "B00005JPCF", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51sX2Hrdz6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Happy Feet (Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "The Dark Knightarrives with tremendous hype (best superhero movie ever? posthumous Oscar for Heath Ledger?), and incredibly, it lives up to all of it.  But calling it the best superhero movie ever seems like faint praise, since part of what makes the movie great--in addition to pitch-perfect casting, outstanding writing, and a compelling vision--is that it bypasses the normal fantasy element of the superhero genre and makes it all terrifyingly real.  Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) is Gotham City's new district attorney, charged with cleaning up the crime rings that have paralyzed the city. He enters an uneasy alliance with the young police lieutenant, Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman), and Batman (Christian Bale), the caped vigilante who seems to trust only Gordon--and whom only Gordon seems to trust. They make progress until a psychotic and deadly new player enters the game: the Joker (Heath Ledger), who offers the crime bosses a solution--kill the Batman. Further complicating matters is that Dent is now dating Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal, after Katie Holmes turned down the chance to reprise her role), the longtime love of Batman's alter ego, Bruce Wayne.In his last completed role before his tragic death, Ledger is fantastic as the Joker, a volcanic, truly frightening force of evil. And he sets the tone of the movie: the world is a dark, dangerous place where there are no easy choices.  Eckhart and Oldman also shine, but as good as Bale is, his character turns out rather bland in comparison (not uncommon for heroes facing more colorful villains). Director-cowriter Christopher Nolan (Memento) follows his critically acclaimedBatman Beginswith an even better sequel that sets itself apart from notable superhero movies likeSpider-Man 2andIron Manbecause of its sheer emotional impact and striking sense of realism--there are no suspension-of-disbelief superpowers here. At 152 minutes, it's a shade too long, and it's much too intense for kids. But for most movie fans--and not just superhero fans--The Dark Knightis a film for the ages.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B00DUCXFUC", "B004LWZWGK", "B000PC6A3E", "B002ZG981E", "B00G4RD4PQ", "B0039208QM", "B001GMALGY", "B00E2Y0YBK", "B00C2IGQBA", "B0039208JE", "B00H14WTLQ", "B0039208CG", "B0085D3I3K", "B0039208C6", "B000M5AJQI", "B00319ECGK", "B001FB55H6", "B00EIG5M5A", "7020070078", "B00E2Y6AUY", "B00D5FMGGS", "B001OQCV6K", "B0013FBS20", "B000Q6GX5Y", "B001GKJ2FC", "B00FPS79F6", "B001992NUQ", "B004JMSIRC", "B001RIY4WE", "B00DYEN6XC", "B008QZ5PY2", "B001F7MSG6", "B00FAHYNWE", "B00J7PRJXU", "B001AQT0Z4", "B001UV4XEW", "B0083SBJXS", "B00AEFY552", "B00C8RD79O", "B007KAJG3K", "B007L4HET8", "B004EPZ07U", "B007L4HFDI", "B00AEFXKOO", "B000PC0U1W", "B00C6B8TB8", "B00HINFI4K", "B003TT2X6I", "B001KZIRM2", "B002ZG99NG", "B00EZ4M68G", "B004SIP90G", "B003ZHR6RK", "B001GCUO16", "B003TT2X6S", "B00JNEWSLS", "B001F3FUK6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00DUCXFUC", "B004LWZWGK", "B002ZG981E", "B000PC6A3E"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "asin": "B00005JPY0", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51pGxSkkz4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Dark Knight [Theatrical Release]"}

{"description": "Available uncut for the first time, the five episodes ofDavy  Crockettthat aired on Walt Disney's \"Disneyland\" show (1954-55) launched  one of the great pop culture crazes of the '50s. An estimated $300 million worth  of Crockett merchandise was sold during the first eight months of the craze,  including 10 million \"coonskin\" caps. Disney didn't spend a lot on the  original episodes, but as host Leonard Maltin observes, the colorful location  and matte shots distinguishedDavy Crockettfrom the cheesy-looking  westerns of the 1950s. The three original episodes were later recut into the  theatrical featureDavy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier(1955); the  more comic adventures from the second season that introduced the flamboyant  riverman Mike Fink (Jeffrey York) becameDavy Crockett and the River  Pirates(1956). Tall and ruggedly handsome, if somewhat limited as an actor,  Fess Parker was effective as the laconic frontiersman. The more experienced  Buddy Ebsen (playing sidekick Georgie Russel) carried many of their scenes.  Fifty years later,Davy Crockettremains an engaging example of national  myth making.

However, he encounters more than a few pitfalls as he attempts to begin a romance with his new goddess, as well as more than a few visits from Belldandy's rambunctious sisters Urd and Skuld.

{"description": "Along Came Jonesis one of the most oddball artifacts from Hollywood's golden age. Gary Cooper (who doubled as producer) plays Melody Jones, a \"common ordinary useless bronc-stomper\" who moseys into the town of Payneville--or is it Painful?--just after legendary bad ass Monte Jarrad has held up the stagecoach. The townsfolk eyeball the \"MJ\" on Melody's stirrup, leap to hysterically wrong conclusions, and start giving him a wide berth--in some cases, the better to lie in ambush for \"Jarrad\" while planning how to spend the bounty money. Now, as it happens--and as his crusty sidekick George (the insuperably irreverent William Demarest) keeps reminding him--Melody can barely get his gun out of the holster without blowing his own kneecap off. All that stands between him and extinction is the quick-thinking intervention of a local maiden, one Cherry de Longpre (Loretta Young). Melody, of course, promptly becomes hogtied with love, not suspecting Cherry's the childhood sweetheart of the real Monte Jarrad (Dan Duryea)....Stylistically the film is a wild mix, with director Stuart Heisler paying close attention to down-the-gun-barrel point of view in several scenes, yet also sitting still for floaty back-projection photography so egregious that it may bring on motion sickness. Still, Nunnally Johnson's script is droll; Cooper clearly relished the chance to poke fun at his strong-silent stereotype; and he and Preston Sturges stalwart Demarest establish a sardonic comic rapport.--Richard T.

{"description": "It takes nearly an hour for anything unusual to happen inWith a Friend Like Harry, but that first hour is oddly unsettling. German filmmaker Dominik Moll reveals the trouble with Harry (Sergi L&oacute;pez) with low-key precision, his thriller sensibility channeled from Hitchcock through Claude Chabrol, while emphasizing casual conversation in the style of Eric Rohmer. Harry's found Michel (Laurent Lucas) in a public restroom, identifying himself as an old schoolmate who remembers far too much about Michel, even though Michel has no recollection of Harry at all. But Harry's an ingratiating type, and nice enough on the surface, so Michel invites Harry and his girlfriend, Plum (Sophie Guillemin), to the summer cottage he's renovating with his wife, Claire (Mathilde Seigner), and their three young daughters. The Spanish actor L&oacute;pez (fromAn Affair of Love) modulates his performance so carefully that Harry's psychosis--never explained, but strangely compelling--reverberates well beyond the film's shocking conclusion. It turns out Harry's been a helpful friend after all, but that's cold comfort in a film that warns us against the kindness of strangers.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00003CXCF", "B004NWPY3E", "B000055YV3", "B00CUKTHES", "B00003CXZ4", "B00006L91I", "B000296E7W", "B00003CXBZ", "B0000C9JFO", "B000K2V7F0", "B000E33W0I", "B0000A1HQP", "B009B8YMB0", "B004YCKKH8", "B00D954ACC", "B001CIOCLC", "B0087IT8FK", "B00005JLRE", "B00006G8G3", "B001FOPOD8", "B0064NTZQ2", "B00006RZ2W", "B00421IR5I", "6304907729", "0792846443", "B000BC8SWO", "B00B9LNQ0U", "B003ZYU3U0", "B0009GX1CE", "B000069HZP", "B004SEUIXS", "B000FGGNA0", "B007TMYL3O", "B000LPS4FC", "B0001EFV9A", "B0009IWFCY", "B0009PW45A", "B008XAT1A4", "B001SJ5X2M", "B00006IUHF", "B0001GH5S8", "B005UNI2XY"], "bought_together": ["B000296E7W"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0031RAOVY"]}, "price": 19.98, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 120900}, "asin": "B00005NTN4", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/517Wa%2BWP5WL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "With A Friend Like Harry"}

{"description": "It's hard to describe the hypnotic authority of director and actor Takeshi Kitano. In his first American venture,Brother, Kitano plays a yakuza who's been exiled from Japan after the death of his boss. In Los Angeles, he discovers that his half-brother has become a small-time hood. Kitano quickly takes over, casually setting in motion gang wars and killing sprees. But a basketball game gets as much emphasis as an assassination; Kitano's camera watches a dead body lit up by the flash of gunshots, completely ignoring the shootout that's causing the light. Yet his movies don't seem arty, just efficient--and effective: you may not know whether to laugh or flinch, but you will not stop watching. As an actor, Kitano slouches, twitches, and stares blankly--but you won't stop watching him either. If you likeBrother, check outFireworksandSonatine; gangsters will never seem the same.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B005X7HA6C", "B0002W4TOO", "B00HI9QDXO", "B00HI9QGWC", "B000051S63", "B001EKGW1Q", "B00004Z1FE", "B005X7HAAS", "1567302238", "B00000JS6J", "B006L4MWVE", "B00000JS6H", "B000051S64", "B0000CABGW", "B004XQO8MS", "B000N4SHNK", "B0002JELR2", "B00HRYH52I", "B003L20IME", "B0009S2T0M", "B00005QCVX", "B0001FGBUW", "B000GBEWNY", "B006H3KQSK", "B0007GADXQ", "B000BGH2A4", "B00HSJ2EMI", "B00ENTX7JU", "B0002YLD2I", "B00005LB86", "B0012SY0E6", "B000R5NZ3C", "B001F0TM3A", "B000KX0IMM", "B00008R9LX", "B00G8CFTCS", "B0009WFEDC", "B004326FCI", "B006L4MX0Y", "B00C6WHPO4", "B006L4MX4A", "B000KX0IMC", "B000UNYJOU", "B000065V38", "B000HXDWOG", "B000063KMR", "B0004Z302Q", "B0000687F5", "B005HG8VE4", "B003Y7F1IW", "B000M4RG06", "B008H1Q3KU", "B001BP4K22", "B0007Q6VXC", "B000IMVE1E", "B003NLE5JA", "B000YENUI6", "B00CMDPTM2", "B0001NBMOY", "B00005YUNV", "B000FELD8Y", "B00EI3Y1JG", "B00000F7E6", "B004H2CXBQ", "B00EO670RW", "B00007L4OM", "B0001XAJYS", "B001RTKKRQ", "B000V6I7WG", "B00CG0YM24", "B00782O7LG", "B0002LE9NQ", "B000H5U5GM", "B0002YLEBI", "B00C6WHSRI", "B004H2IMSO", "B00005QAOZ", "B008G1JIQC", "B00IIPL1JS", "B00284G2BC", "B00006HAYO", "B0085A9HXS", "B0016LHH62", "B007ZC31R0", "B0009XRZQK", "B000ZM1MGE", "B000XBPDYO", "B0036BDQBU", "B000IJ7A5Q", "B000031EG0", "B003U6SJY0", "B007V2LNDI", "B000EE3FUY", "B005FQ1OOK", "B0024FAG2G", "B00008WJCJ", "B00005A1TJ", "B000MRA59C", "B004P7CNC2"], "bought_together": ["B005X7HA6C"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005X7HA6C", "B00HI9QGWC", "1567302238", "B006L4MWVE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 62249}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.3, "brand": "Brother", "asin": "B00005RYKV", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/511Se235xYL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Brother"}

Zander and lead guitarist Rick Nielsen churn things up on the closing \"Gonna Raise Hell,\" and throughout the set drummer Bun E. Carlos and bassist Tom Petersson keep everything pulsing and locked in. The DVD's only shortcoming is its sound, which remains dynamically limited and essentially monaural, even in 5.1--a missed opportunity to put us right there in the club with the band.--Michael Mikesell", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00278FSTG", "B002G1WPGS", "B00028HBSE", "B00005OCLC", "6305458162", "B00009V7TJ", "B003MX5ORG", "B000008MLM", "B00000ILG6", "B002BH4EZM", "B000002ADX", "B000FILW86", "B0012GMVSA", "B001FA30V0", "B0012GMX9W", "B000006M9T", "B00DPH7V8E", "B007REABAG", "B00005A0BD", "B000006L4W"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002G1WPGS", "B00005OCLC", "B003MX5ORG", "B0015RCUTG"]}, "price": 13.98, "categories": [["CDs & Vinyl", "Classic Rock", "Album-Oriented Rock (AOR)"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Metal"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Pop", "Vocal Pop"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Rock", "Power Pop"], ["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 288330}, "asin": "B000062XFM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51KJ9BM83RL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Cheap Trick - Music for Hangovers"}

{"description": "This movie follows the unwritten law of sequels: bring back the same characters and put them in similar jeopardy with slightly tweaked circumstances. Instead of a cross-country journey, this time the pet trio must get from the San Francisco airport across the Golden Gate Bridge to their suburban home. Michael J. Fox and Sally Field return as the voices of Chance the bulldog and Sassy the cat, with Ralph Waite replacing the late Don Ameche as the elderly golden retriever. Their journey features dogfights, house fires, an epic battle with a pair of petnappers, and a love affair for Chance with a stray from the other side of the bridge (Carla Gugino). Sinbad voices another dog who guides them through the mean streets of the city by the bay, and Robert Hays stars as the father, but, frankly, that hardly matters. What does is the animals' banter, and they're funny.

So everyone worries: what will become of Toula? Then one day she sees the ultimate unattainable guy and realizes the only way her life will get better is if he gets away from her big, fat Greek family. Toula escapes from the family restaurant. She exchanges her seating hostess jacket for a college diploma, convinces her aunt to give her a new job, and trades in her coke-bottle glasses for contact lenses, just in time for \"him\" to walk back into her life. Ian Miller is tall, handsome but defnitely not Greek. Their courtship is an Olympian culture clash. Can Ian handle Toula, her parents, her aunts, uncles, cousins and several centuries of Greek heritage? Will Toula discover the love she's been missing right in the heart of her big, fat family? One thing is for sure, for better or worse, for richer or poorer, with Ian's proposal Toula is headed for her big, fat Greek wedding.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0021L8UO4", "B000EHRVOW", "B00386EZKE", "B000ELJAEM", "B0013D8LHC", "B00003CXSM", "B00AEBB8NS", "6304765266", "B0000CGNEF", "B00466HN7M", "B00005JG6N", "B000BKVQS4", "B0007RT9M6", "B0009OL7Z4", "B0038N9X3Q", "6305236569", "B002ZG988M", "B001AKTZW8", "B00006ZXSL", "B000YDBPAM", "B0015I2RT8", "B001TUZD8O", "B0000AOV4I", "B00AEBB8YW", "B000MQC9H4", "B00007E2F5", "B002ZG989G", "B0001AVZA8", "B0000897EG", "B00AEFXYOA", "B004SIP9RO", "B0007PLLBU", "B000OCZA04", "B00008NRI7", "B001GKJ2DY", "B002K0WBXW", "B00008G7UF", "B008R65XMO", "B000A343RI", "B001ECDVK4", "B0000VD02Y", "B000023VTP", "B001Y8DJVE", "B002ZG9968", "B003BV8ICC", "B0001XALGY", "B003B3V0N4", "B00006ZXSO", "B00006ZXSK", "B002U4UYZA", "B002U1LGTQ", "B00005JN3W", "B003Y5H524", "B000GETTIE", "B000J103OI", "B00DW5IJR6", "B00003CXC3", "B00AEFY99O", "B00AEBBA2M", "B001LMAK9W", "B0042816YK", "B006VRRGQ2", "B000JU8H9C", "B004IK30PA", "B00AEFXO8Q", "B005LAIGXW", "B0000B1OFL", "B00158K0QU", "B004SIP9VA", "B00006ZXSQ", "6305428352", "B005Z9MFRC", "B000K7VHTQ", "B000Z8GZYW", "B00AEFY5TI", "0767810856", "B0001I55M4", "B004SIP8LG", "B000FOPPC4", "B000E6EHE0", "B00005JPSM", "0800177258", "6305428387", "6305803781", "B004EPZ070", "0800141849"], "bought_together": ["B00386EZKE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00386EZKE", "B00466HN7M", "B0021L8UO4", "B0009OL7Z4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 2192}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.99, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00006FMUW", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51EhfedTTUL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "My Big Fat Greek Wedding"}
{"description": "Dr. Fred Steele (Umberto Orsini) and Eve Barnett (Maya Brent) work together at an astronomical station on a bucolic island. Steele has just had his request for a transfer approved, and he and Eve look forward to leaving the island and getting married. However, their budding romance is quickly put on hold as the station's scientists learn they must deal with a rogue planet -- \"The Outsider\" -- that has entered the solar system, and which is on a collision course with Earth. The brilliant but cantankerous Professor Benson (Claude Rains), living in an adjacent greenhouse with his dog Gideon, predicts that the Outsider will not strike the Earth but will simply make a close pass-a prediction that no other scientist will endorse. Meanwhile, a military base on Mars encounters the stray planet on its approach to Earth, and Commander Robert Cole and his wife Cathy quickly travel to the island outpost from Mars to help with the effort.\n\nThe base scientists are elated when the Outsider passes the earth at a distance of 95,000 miles, just as Benson predicted. But Benson himself is stunned when the Outsider takes up an orbit round Earth.

{"description": "Historians may never agree about where and when rock 'n' roll was born, but they do agree that an entrepreneur in the world of music named Sam Phillips began a revolution and spawned a legacy when he created Sun Records. This Memphis-based success story defined some of the most appealing roots of American popular culture with such seminal artists as Elvis Presley, Carl Perkins, Johnny Cash, Jerry Lee Lewis, and so many others, all reprised in this two-hour American Masters film with such performers as Paul McCartney, Jimmy Page, Robert Plant, and Live, many accompanied by Elvis' original sidemen, Scotty Moore and D.J. Fontana. Highlights include a moving rendition of \"Lonely Weekends\" with Jerry Lee Lewis and Matchbox Twenty, and an emotional reunion of old Mississippi Delta musicians.

Wilson (as his  understandably frustrated girlfriend), Ron Livingston, Bill Bellamy, and Alyssa  Milano--have their moments, but the script doesn't offer them much to work with.

{"description": "Notoriously, and entirely appropriately, the original outline for Doug Naylor and Rob Grant's comedy sci-fi seriesRed Dwarfwas sketched on the back of a beer mat. When it finally appeared on British television in 1988, the show had clearly stayed true to its roots, mixing jokes about excessive curry consumption with affectionate parodies of classic sci-fi. Indeed, one of the show's most endearing and enduring features is its obvious respect for genre conventions, even as it gleefully subverts them. The scenario owes something to Douglas Adams's satiricalHitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, something toThe Odd Couple, and a lot more to the slacker sci-fi of John Carpenter'sDark Star. Behind the crew's constant bickering there lurks an impending sense that life, the universe, and everything are all someone's idea of a terrible joke.Later seasons broadened the show's horizons until at last its premise was so diluted as to be unrecognizable, but in the six episodes of the first season, the comedy is witty and intimate, focusing on characters and not special effects. Slob Dave Lister (Craig Charles) is the last human alive after a radiation leak wipes out the crew of the vast mining vesselRed Dwarf(Episode 1, \"The End\"). He bums around the spaceship with the perpetually uptight and annoyed hologram of his dead bunkmate, Arnold Rimmer (Chris Barrie, the show's greatest comedy asset), and a creature evolved from a cat (dapper Danny John Jules). They are guided rather haphazardly by Holly, the worryingly thick main computer (lugubrious Norman Lovett).--Mark Walker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00007AP32", "B0000WN0ZA", "B0000WN0ZU", "B0006Z2L0G", "B0006Z2L0Q", "B000EU1Q4U", "B000BVM1TQ", "B0026P3HPW", "B009Z59778", "B000BHHVNQ", "B002FQJT0Y", "B001DF681G", "B009Z5BPYG", "B002GP7ZV4", "B007AFC0W4", "B002BAW6FE", "B006LPHY6G", "0140174664", "B001NOMOS8", "B001YYQA0K", "B00006LPCK", "B002EOVX9W", "B00443FN1A", "B002GP7ZVO", "B002LFQIMQ", "B006LPHY5C", "B002LFPAUM", "B00FAVRFXE", "B002BAW6GI", "B0007G89FU", "0140143882", "B002LFQIMG", "B00004Z4TO", "B008R52LA2", "B0000DZSYB", "B00272NJ7K", "B000GI3RZ6", "B002LFQIN0", "B002BAW6H2", "B002BAW6FY", "B002D1XKB0", "B0000UJL96", "B000FIHN8O", "B001T46TCE", "0451452011", "B00HCK7THS", "B001AGXEBU", "B00008KA57", "B003L77GWE", "B001D2WUGG", "B002BIULNA", "B001QCWQ62", "B00BD6K54G", "B00GOC74QG", "B001Q9ECNA", "B000BP86Y6", "B001QCWQ5S", "B005PPMHO2", "B00064AME4", "B00AZMFJYA", "0140171509", "B0009X75J2", "B000Z7G87C", "B00005A1SY", "B00009MEJT", "B000HWZ4HU", "B004EXWGHY", "B004QOB8TS", "B000AYELJ2", "B000067FPC", "B001HUWQEA", "B000AJJNFE", "B000127LW2", "B00022FWEU", "B000RO9PTQ", "B00ECXJC28", "B002I9Z8BM", "B001QCWQ58", "B00D3ZJFBO", "B0000AQS0F", "B005SH65GI", "B001C71IGA", "B002I9Z8AS", "B000777I88", "B001O4C6NA", "B000LC4ZI0", "B00129W6LE", "B000QRI1GW", "B0089AD8IO", "B000KGGIRI", "B000FJH5MC", "B004QOB8SO"], "bought_together": ["B00007AP32", "B0000WN0ZA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000GI3RZ6", "B009Z59778", "B0006Z2L0G", "B0026P3HPW"]}, "price": 13.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 90398}, "asin": "B00007AP31", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51F8ZQYDF9L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Red Dwarf: Series I"}

{"description": "Even viewers who consider themselves beyond their teen-angst years might findDawson's Creekcompelling watching.  For years Dawson (James Van Der Beek) and Joey (Katie Holmes) have watched movies and slept in the same bed, but they find that as they enter high school their relationship will inevitably change.  That becomes especially clear when Dawson is immediately attracted to Capeside, Massachusetts's sexy new arrival, Jen (Michelle Williams). Meanwhile, their friend Pacey (Joshua Jackson) pursues an unachievable love object.Creator Kevin Williamson basedDawson's Creekon his own youth, and sure, the characters may not really look or sound 15, but the Dawson-Joey-Jen interplay--especially embodied by the sad-eyed and cynical (but still adorable) Joey and the smart but emotionally inept Dawson--gives the show its heart.  And just like Williamson's fresh take on the teen-horror genre,Scream,Dawson's Creekhas a winking self-awareness, for example when Dawson says they're having a \"90210moment\" or explains that they use big words because they watch too many movies. Highlights of the first season include Dawson's discovery that his perfect home life may not be so perfect, an unwelcome reminder of Jen's past, theBreakfast Clubtakeoff \"Detention,\" theScreamtakeoff \"The Scare,\" a beauty contest in which two unlikely competitors square off, and the heart-rending finale.On the DVDs, Williamson and producer Paul Stubin have a commentary track for both the pilot episode and the last episode, in which they offer parallels between the two \"bookends,\" notes on the locations, vast praise for their cast and affection for the show, and a few spoilers regarding subsequent seasons.  Williamson and Stubin also do all the talking in an 8-minute featurette \"From Day One,\" while Van Der Beek, Holmes, Jackson, and (briefly) Williams discuss their characters in the 7-minute \"Season One Time Capsule,\" recorded back when the series premiered.  On the downside, picture quality is sometimes quite grainy, perhaps because all 13 episodes plus bonuses are squeezed onto three discs.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000E5NPY", "B0002234R2", "B0002RQ3MK", "B0007V6IW6", "B000EAT23C", "B0000AUHQ9", "B0001IN0T4", "B0006FFRBG", "B0077PTWY6", "B002BAW6HW", "B000NA1PUG", "B002BAW6I6", "B0077PTWHI", "B00BGQ2NIO", "B0012BS5XU", "B0009K7QZ8", "B000H7JCG4", "B0001CCXZW", "B000BNXD6O", "B0002V7TZQ", "B00133QNRW", "B001EWDXT8", "B00133QNS6", "B000RF1QE2", "B00BGQ2NDO", "B000GYI32M", "B004GJYRFA", "B000QDLSR0", "B0000AKY3Q", "B000U1ZV2G", "B002JVWRB8", "B0001O3YLM", "B000FUTVPA", "B000MEYJII", "B000W6ZUUC", "B000NOKFGW", "B00127RAGM", "B0050MB5P2", "B00133QNSG", "B001FB4VX0", "B005CGI3ZG", "B000R7HRRA", "B0011UBDS6", "B0012GN23S", "B002BJGYU8", "B002BJGYTY", "B0006IUE16", "B0002I838Q", "B000EWBNMS", "B000N6TYLW", "B0018CWEZI", "B001ILFUB4", "B002JVWRBS", "B008FTX6MM", "B005PWZ472", "B002BJGYV2", "B0006J28DM", "B000H7JCGE", "B000QUTTPG", "B001RXDM2C", "B0009QTRVI", "B001ILFUAA", "B00005JO9J", "B00007IG1M", "B0014DO5XU", "B000JLTRIG", "B0002MPQRS", "B003R0MF7G", "B0026RLM6Q", "B001QE99AQ", "B0018CWEVW", "B005FISC52", "B00005JNOG", "B0032UYFAQ", "B0053O8AFK", "B000G1R4SY", "B003SNJXMC", "B000FUTVLO", "B000CCBCGM", "B003R4ZMJU", "B000P12LWY", "B0009IW88K", "B004SIP9X8", "B0006Q93BA", "B00001PE4D", "B000GG4Y6O", "B002DQSKME", "B00079FUI6", "B0009KQP96", "B0018CWEYY", "B0058JEI06", "B000FIMG68", "B000FKO3GW", "B000TGJ8D0", "B000P6YNSE", "B000Q6GUKW", "B003F3NE1G", "B002BJGYTO", "B003R0MF6W", "B0009CTVLS"], "bought_together": ["B0000E5NPY", "B0002234R2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005CGI3ZG", "B0077PTWY6", "B0000E5NPY", "B0002234R2"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 30579}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 13.99, "brand": "Columbia Tri Star", "asin": "B00008AOX3", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51MR5EB1MML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Dawson's Creek - The Complete First Season"}

{"description": "It was a short but sweet fifth season forSex and the City, as HBO's resident comediennes found themselves affected by forces beyond their control--the pregnancies of both Sarah Jessica Parker (Carrie) and Cynthia Nixon (Miranda). A truncated shooting schedule to accommodate the actresses forced this season to be reduced to a mere eight episodes, and indeed, you can tell both actresses are expecting. (Carrie's wardrobe became more outlandish and more concealing than usual.) Still, the actresses and creators forged ahead, creating a handful of episodes that if short in content were long on emotion and laughs. Whereas the fourth season found all four grappling with various relationships, the fifth season focused on the perils of being single, with a new intensity lacking in the previous sexcapades. Carrie and Miranda wrestled with their solitary lifestyles, albeit with new attachments--Miranda had new baby Brady and single motherhood, while Carrie found herself in the world of publishing as the author of a real-life book of her columns. Charlotte (Kristin Davis) wondered if she'd ever find another man, while Samantha (Kim Cattrall) finally got rid of the one that had been vexing her far too much, hotelier Richard (James Remar). If the season as a whole felt less than the sum of its parts, those parts were some of the best comedy in the show's history, from Samantha's anointment as the \"Michiko Kakutani of vibrators\" to Carrie's stressful, one-degree-from-fiasco book launch party. (And fear not, Chris Noth's Mr. Big does pop up now and again.) The season's climactic episode, \"I Love a Charade,\" found all four at the straight wedding of a seemingly gay pal (Nathan Lane) and contemplating their future with a wry, bemused tone. It was one of the series' best episodes ever, equally touching and funny, and grounded the show in an emotional maturity that announced that after all their wild travails, these women had truly grown up.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00382S9U0", "B00382S9UA", "B00382S9T6", "B00382S9SW", "B00382S9SM", "B00AYVDUPW", "B00004RFCM", "B00005AVCA", "B001DDBCUA", "B002ZG98Z0", "B006WZIB1C", "B00AQ5RRJQ", "B001675YWK", "B0002SDY1W", "B005IFIUEU", "B00AS870P2", "B0013FSL16", "B00IKX4LEK", "B001PQZYQI", "B002ZG98ZA", "0743457307", "B00079FUI6", "0446617687", "B001DDBCV4", "B002PJ4HNK", "B001675YW0", "B000P6YNTI", "B000FIMG4U", "B0018CWEYO", "B001VPJYZK", "B001VPJZ0O", "B0001CCXZW", "B003F3NE1Q", "B003CN5SAY", "B00D8H3LR6", "B002BJGYTO", "B00DRSGQ7I", "B002BJGYU8", "B004EPYZRG", "B002BJGYV2", "B005IA9JRM", "B003L77GFG", "B0077PTWHI", "B000069HYG", "B0000844MI", "B004SEUJK0", "B000G1R3A8", "B00BUWD7Y8", "B0018CWEXK", "B002YBUX0K", "B005IA9JQI", "B000EMGJ7C", "B0006SGYM4", "B002VWNIBI", "B00005JMYI", "B00I458456", "B00AEBB8YW", "B00466HN7M", "B00A81MV3U", "B005LAIIHG", "B0000DIXDR", "B002K0WBXW"], "bought_together": ["B00382S9U0", "B00382S9UA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00382S9SM", "B00004RFCM", "B00382S9SW", "B00382S9T6"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 53385}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 17.89, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00008PW2D", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Ps3SLLDZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Sex and the City: Season 5"}
{"description": "Though dressed in the guise of a murder mystery,Quai des Orf&#xE8;vresis a rich, engrossing character study in which murder plays a secondary role. Six years before the triumph ofThe Wages of Fear, director Henri-Georges Clouzot couldn't find a copy of his source novel (L&#xE9;gitime Defense, by Stanislas-Andr&#xE9; Steeman), so he crafted this stylish police procedural from spotty memory, infuriating the author while freeing himself to explore the depths of his all-too-human characters. Using atmospheric Parisian locations and shadowy compositions that rival anything in American film noir, Clouzot gives plausible alibis to the prime suspects--a dancehall chanteuse, her suspicious husband, and a fashionable lesbian photographer--while a seasoned detective (played to perfection by Louis Jouvet) efficiently sorts through the clues. Anyone expecting thrills will be disappointed: Clouzot's fascination with human behavior prevails, and this subtle mix of motives and secrets is delicately balanced with underworld cynicism and a compassionate understanding of the human heart.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00014K5Y6", "B00005NFZA", "B0000633SC", "B00026L74U", "B0006HC0I2", "B0019X400I", "B000059H7Q", "B001CW7ZSA", "B000HT3QBE", "B0007WFYC0", "B00005B1ZK", "B0011U3OA6", "B0001ZIYDO", "B001CW7ZSU", "B00005QAPJ", "B00005EBSB", "B001WLMOOG", "B00IO9J5XW", "B004WPYO7E", "B000QXDFRQ", "B002E01M9W", "B00005JKPT", "B008CJ0JS4", "B004ALIG4W", "B00006FMAR", "B0046ZYEVG", "B004ALIG1U", "B00IGK6T9W", "B000127IF2", "B00008YOFG", "B00005A8TV", "B001PYD0KM", "B000BC8SWO", "B00005N7Z1", "0780023536", "B0078G9RMQ", "B00000IOKV", "B0000BUZKP", "B001TIQT6G", "0780021541", "B00HE010QM", "1559409053", "B001BEK8C4", "B00004Z1FM", "B000CBG5PG", "B00007CVS3", "B000BC8SWE", "B00007ELDG", "B00180R05O", "B001O549FM", "B000ZM1MIM", "0780020707", "B004NWPY1Q", "B00F98FOFY", "B000PKG6OY", "B00005A8TU", "B00ION69AK", "B00IYJFB2G", "B0016B6ZEC", "B0009298N4", "B00K5EJHGO", "B004ALIG4M", "B003ELKNO0", "B001D8W7EK", "B003N2CVRC", "B00IBIIQTU", "B002U6DVQ2", "B00005JKGX", "B004NWPY3E", "B001D8W7EU", "B00004W3HG", "B001BSBBDK", "B00GBT62PQ", "B00GPPXNEE", "B00B2BYXWM", "B000E5LEVA", "B002E01M9M", "B00008H2GS", "6305922756", "B000025RE7", "B00004ZBVO", "0780022629", "B005HK13OK", "B000BB14IA", "B007USWCR4", "B004ALIG0G", "B0006Z2NE0", "B000A59Q4G", "B00K6J7G66", "B000NOK0HG", "B00AQ6J5YA", "B000LP6KNU", "B009X919UE", "B000244EYW", "B008BSM1CI", "B00004TX1R", "B00005UQ7Q", "0780023161", "B00023P4FQ", "B004NAZ7QA"], "bought_together": ["B00014K5Y6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0016C3594", "B00014K5Y6", "B004NWPY3E", "B0078G9RMQ"]}, "price": 69.97, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 70579}, "asin": "B00008RH15", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/512S0QG1NVL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Quai des Orfevres (The Criterion Collection)"}

{"description": "Bathed in self-conscious cool, \"Confidence\" is a heist caper in which the heist is unimportant. As you might expect from \"Glengarry Glen Ross\" director James Foley, this pulpy concoction is more interested in giving good actors a lot of hip, salty dialogue as they scheme their way to the royal scam. It's a poor man's \"Ocean's Eleven\", just as enjoyable in its own way, beginning when con artist Jake (Edward Burns) discovers he's accidentally stolen from an eccentric crime boss (Dustin Hoffman, oozing threat in a fine character turn). Promising to make amends by pulling the biggest con of his career, Jake adds a feisty pickpocket (Rachel Weisz) to his crew, which includes scene-stealer Paul Giammatti and Andy Garcia as a disheveled FBI agent (or is he?). With a cast like this you can't go wrong, but \"Confidence\" cons itself into thinking it's original, while Burns's abundant voice-overs state the obvious and plot twists unfold with minimal surprise. It hardly matters; \"Confidence\" may be derivative, but it's still recommendable. \"--Jeff Shannon\"", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005UQ9T", "B000H0M4BG", "B006QVRWL2", "B00DW5IL38", "B001HVZOBG", "B00004W5U6", "B002J1RZHE", "B000HRMAVS", "B0018PH3LK", "B00006G8JD", "B004TDWQSS", "B00AEBB8LA", "B0016MJ6WO", "B00005NGAG", "B00005LDDD", "B000QXDFRG", "B00005JMBQ", "B004YCKKFK", "B001J710Z2", "B00005V9HH", "B0010YVCB6", "B00009L1TA", "B000BPK2KC", "B00HOGBXS6", "B00ARVRD3E", "B00H9KKKAY", "B00GMV8M2Y", "B00012QLB4", "B00BNH9NCU", "B00IARA8KM", "B0019EXZY4", "B009AMAJPA", "B002H6NVM4", "0792833279", "B004SIP9CO", "B004SUDQ5Y", "B007CEFTSA", "B00JJ3EHCG", "B00FRILRL6", "6304698747", "B000C65Z1G", "B00004YMYZ", "B001BEK8HO", "B0011VIO3M", "B0014GI6I2", "B00014NEZI", "B00FFT19XS", "B001JIE7JC", "B004YCKJSS", "B001CIOCO4", "B003EYVXXW", "B0071HPOGK", "B0009MDPYM", "B00CC3464E", "B006ISJQ26", "B004IFYMWK", "B00A47BT7C", "B00DWZHTOU", "B001N44BVQ", "B00102F5WK", "B00080ZG10", "B004SIP6VI", "B006DHATE6", "B00005JPD0", "B005335K8G", "6305263248", "B004SIP95G", "B0016MJ6HY", "B00011CZRE", "B004IK30M8", "B00005JN2Z", "B00BEIYNRS", "B00H3JHHSE", "B0009X7BDC", "B00EL6A7PW", "B000XA5K48", "B00005JKG9", "B00DMEBXDE", "B00J5LXQX8", "B000K7UBSO", "B00J4LMJ3W", "B009AMAL4Y", "B000B8GT92", "B0034G4P30", "B0007R4SZO", "B00DVD5SBE", "B000GFLKF8", "B002ZG97O2", "B00H9KKGTO", "B000F1IQN2", "B00D3LA5WG", "B000ENC5YW", "B008JFURII", "B001U0HB5Q", "6305127646", "B002AT8K9W", "B008E70EES", "B000SM6FLI", "B0045HCJ5S", "B00007AJE1"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002J1RZHE", "B00DW5IL38", "B004TDWQSS", "B00005UQ9T"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 204847}, "asin": "B0000AGQ2E", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514C6D7T63L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Confidence"}

As with theMatrixtrilogy,Avalonis more intriguing in premise than execution, filled with hushed tones and heavy-handed portent.

{"description": "This low-key, thoroughly delightful comedy is the product of Scottish comic/actor/writer/director Craig Ferguson's goofy and sweet imagination. Ferguson plays retired rock star Paul Kerr, a 1980s sensation whose whiskey-fueled antics in a Welsh mansion land him, involuntarily, in a psychiatric hospital. In short order, an old bandmate (Ralph Brown) turns up to help Paul get sober, and a long-lost love (Jemma Redgrave) introduces the mortified musician to an adolescent daughter (Charlotte Church) he never knew he had. Lots of catching up and relationship repairs ensue, but the film is really an off-center, eccentric comedy in which quaint villagers debate the origins of guitar feedback and 75-year-old veteran actor Joss Ackland (Surviving Picasso) can be found performing Roy Orbison rockers. A pleasant surprise is golden-throated Church's acting debut; revered for years as a singing prodigy, she proves to be a natural actress and outstanding pop-song stylist.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["0790748460", "B00003CXMY", "B000063K0J", "B005FHHD58", "B00CQRNLLU", "B001NFNFIU", "B000Z27HFE", "B0040JHF32", "B001053024", "B00007CVRM", "B00FBQ38VQ", "B00005Y6XP", "1573301469", "B0009U5DCQ", "0811853756", "B00005AUGM", "0061998494", "B00004ZDPO", "B00000I9CF", "B00002EPP9", "0811858197", "B000053VAE", "B0041QSZGU", "B004IY6AS0", "0061719544", "B000CSRSGY", "B0019BI19Q", "B000002PEY", "B007K7IBTI", "B0060RU2QO", "B00472O3C8", "B0007VCUGO", "B00FPPQYXM", "B00005NFY6", "B002I5GNZQ", "0752893394", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B0009PBLU4", "B00BTYU3QW", "B000G0F13K", "6305588236", "B00000ILEC", "B00008DDVT", "B002WY65UQ", "B008R3EYWM", "B0026RX2VE", "B00007GZZW", "B00005JLJC", "B002GOAH1U", "B0009OJ9R2", "B003OOH444", "B00AZMFO6I"], "bought_together": ["B00003CXMY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00003CXMY", "B00000I9CF", "0790748460", "B005MWPW86"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 47897}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.79, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B0000TG492", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51538Xcdj5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "I'll Be There"}

{"description": "After a long wait--like the entire fifth season--Carrie Bradshaw (Sarah Jessica Parker) is dating again. The sixth season of the popular HBO show starts with Carrie and her sparkly new potential, Berger (Ron Livingston), trying to leave past relationships and hit it off. The results are mixed (up to Berger's memorable exit), but the good news is Carrie is at it again, and a new love interest can be found in the member of a wedding party, an old high school flame (David Duchovny), or an &uuml;ber-famous painter (Mikhail Baryshnikov). As Carrie plays the field, her friends seem to be settling down, relatively speaking. Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) decides that her affair with TiVo cannot compete when Mr. Perfect (Blair Underwood, at his most charming) moves into her building. Charlotte's (Kristin Davis) feelings for her \"opposites attract\" boyfriend (Evan Handler, perhaps fans' most-loved boyfriend) deepen, but they still have a few things to iron out. Most surprising is Samantha's (Kim Cattrall) hot relationship with waiter-actor-stud Smith Jerrod (Jason Lewis) taking on something resembling love, despite Samantha's best intentions.Before the sixth season started in the summer of 2003, a bombshell hit: it was announced that this would be the finale. Fans, just getting over the truncated fifth season (due to half the cast getting pregnant), were beside themselves. But it would be a long season, and these 12 episodes plant the seeds for the final 8 airing the following winter. These dozen episodes illustrate the maturity of the show: there's not a bad one in the bunch, with things like old flames Mr. Big (Chris Noth), and Steve (David Eigenberg) popping in with deeper resiliency. And the show is still flat-out funny. Berger is the most intrinsically humorous of Carrie's beaus (his introduction to Prada is a classic), Jarrod's earnest streak on Samantha gets her flabbergasted in the giddiest ways, and Charlotte's attempt to convert to Judaism is right in character. The touchstone episode is \"A Woman's Right to Shoes,\" in which Carrie loses her prized and expensive Manolo Blahniks at a party. The comedy blends serious points of how we perceive singles, couples, and parents (and the gifts we lavish on the latter two). Carrie's method of celebrating her singlehood is just another gem in this treasure of a series.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00382S9UA", "B00382S9TQ", "B00382S9T6", "B00382S9SW", "B00382S9SM", "B00004RFCM", "B00AYVDUPW", "B00005AVCA", "B002ZG98Z0", "B001DDBCUA", "B006WZIB1C", "B00AQ5RRJQ", "B001675YWK", "B005IFIUEU", "B002ZG98ZA", "B00FKNR3W0", "B001GTZEZ0", "B00079FUI6", "B002PJ4HNK", "B001DDBCV4", "B00IKX4LEK", "B000P6YNTI", "B00AIQAS76", "B00009Y3RW", "B000W6ZUUC", "0446617687", "B005Z28M58", "B001PQZYQI", "B001AQBGM4", "B0013FSL16", "B000HIVIOC", "B002BJGYV2", "B000EQ45BU", "B003R0MEXQ", "B000FIMG4U", "B003L77GFG", "B0018CWEYO", "B00EF4U7JQ", "B001VPJYZK", "B0042816YK", "B00D8H3LR6", "B003Y5HWGI", "B002BJGYU8", "B0007R4SWC", "B002BJGYTY", "B00005K3NR", "B002BJGYTO", "B000068CNX", "B00DRSGQ7I", "B0001907BW", "B0000844MI", "B008NFN33U", "B0002I84FS", "B0037XPPAM", "B0009WFEEG", "B00000FBH2", "B003F3NDP8", "B001BL96K2", "B000RBA6CO", "B0001CCXZW", "B0018RKEQY", "B001DPHDBU", "B005IA9JRM", "B00466HN7M", "B002AMVED8", "B004YM6JF0", "B00001W9G0", "B004SEUJK0", "B000P6YNSO", "B000069HYG", "B00005JNDZ", "B005IA9JQI", "B001FB4VX0", "B0083XXVFW", "B005LAIIHG", "B00JM5C8WM", "B00005JMYI", "B000XKW2WG", "B001DJLCRC", "B00AEBB8YW", "B000VDDE0E", "B00E8RKHWW", "B008JFUOWM", "B0001I561E", "B00AEFYM2S", "B002ZG976U", "B00DL47424"], "bought_together": ["B00382S9UA", "B00382S9TQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00004RFCM", "B00382S9TQ", "B00382S9SM", "B00382S9T6"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 31405}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 28.48, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B0001ENX5E", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DH7CZ5DNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Sex and the City: Season 6, Part 1"}
{"description": "Two pretty high school girls (one a cheerleader!) don't like their mother or her new boyfriend (\"Daddy would have gotten us Uzis!\"). One morning, they wake up to find that everybody in Los Angeles has been turned to dust by a Comet except them, a guy who looks like Erik Estrada, some zombies and the occupants of a secret underground government installation. Written by Mark Logan Two girls from the Valley wake up to find that a passing comet has eradicated their world and left behind a mysterious red-dust and a pack of cannibal mutants. With the help of a friendly truck driver, the girls save the earth from a villainous \"think tank,\" karate chop their way through flesh-eating zombies, and, of course, find time to go to the mall. Written by Jaime Kidwell\n\nTwo sisters, high school seniors in the early 1980s, awaken one morning to blood red skies and the realization that the human race has been wiped out. It becomes apparent that anyone who was not surrounded by steel when the Earth recently passed through the tail of Haley's comet has been reduced to a pile of red ash (the trace elements of human chemical makeup.) They encounter a rebellious Native American man and take over the air waves at a local radio station in an attempt to get help. Unfortunately, they attract the attention of a group of scientists who knew what the effects of the comet would be. They hid underground in a steel laboratory, but idiotically left the vents open. Now, as various survivors of the comet who were only partially surrounded by steel are decaying into flesh-hungry zombies, the scientists are attempting to come up with a vaccine made of the blood of people who were not infected by the comet. Thus the trio must fight their way past not only roving packs of the cannibalistic dead, but also outsmart a pack of scientists desperate not to become that way themselves.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B003JIPN20", "B003PIUINI", "6300182355", "0792845684"], "also_viewed": ["B002KPUN0K"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 232523}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 24.95, "brand": "", "asin": "B0001GV4PI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41101R6Z2KL.jpg", "title": "Night of the Comet"}

{"description": "The third season ofAliasfound super spy Sydney Bristow (Jennifer Garner) waking up in Hong Kong with a monster hangover and two years in the future with nary a memory. What's worse, her world has been turned upside-down with the evil Sloane (Ron Rifkin) now a world-famous humanitarian and philanthropist, and, even worse, her true love Vaughn (Michael Vartan) married to a seemingly great gal. Nice way to go back to work, eh? After coming up with one heck of a cliffhanger inseason 2,Aliasproceeded a bit aimlessly through these 22 episodes, and as a result, the parts were truly greater than the whole. With Lena Olin no longer around as Syd's duplicitous mother, and the addition of admirable yet bland Melissa George as Vaughn's wife Lauren, Garner found herself for the first time without a compelling female foil to play off of. By dividing its focus equally between the quest for the enigmatic Rambaldi device, Syd and Vaughn's now-contentious relationship, and the uncovering of Syd's missing years,Aliaslost a little of its power without a larger story arc. The loss of regular cast members Merrin Dungey (Francie/Alison) and Bradley Cooper (Will)--both of whom do make great guest appearances--also divest the show of the personal life that kept Sydney human and approachable. Still, Garner is stellar as always, the plot twists come fast and furious, and secret identities are revealed. This season does have a great panorama of guest actors including Ricky Gervais, Justin Theroux, Djimon Hounsou, David Cronenberg, Quentin Tarantino, Vivica A. Fox, and Isabella Rossellini as Syd's long-lost aunt.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001MVWRNO", "B001MVWRMU", "B001MVWRN4", "B001MVWRNE", "B000FIMG68", "B00005JNOG", "B000QDLSR0", "B0024FAD9C", "B001B7CNZ6", "B000FIMG4U", "B00079FUI6", "B000NDEXK2", "B000P6YNSE", "B0018CWEYY", "B000AJJNFE", "B000W6ZUUC", "B000I0QLQY", "B000B837XI", "B0006UEVTK", "B000EHSVLE", "B0012CJQY6", "B00008ZL4Q", "B000O77SMW", "B000R7HRRA", "B0002DRE72", "B000B8I9ZO", "B000EHSVL4", "B00008YGRU", "B001VPJZ0E", "B000BNI90Y", "B0012CJQYG", "B0047BXR30", "B000I0QLRI", "B0047BXR8U", "B002N5N5MK", "B000ICLRKC", "B000P6YNTI", "B00129W6LE", "B000I0QLRS", "B0051GOB2G", "B0024F08RO", "B0024FAR66", "B000EHSVLY", "B000O77SN6", "B0015RRNMA", "B003F3NDW6", "B00064VQXA", "B00062IDEW", "B002DQSKME", "B0002XVQSU", "B0018CWEZI", "B000ERVJKE", "B000B5XOVQ", "B000EHSVMS", "B001FB4VX0", "B0012CJQZ0", "B000FKO3GW", "B00BTFK01Y", "B000I0QLR8", "B000B8IA08", "B0018CWEYO", "B00133QNSG", "B0012CJQZA", "B0001906X6", "B0001907BC", "B001C8W7EQ", "B00020H9NO", "B003R0MEXQ", "B00188XHF8", "B0019LY5IM", "B0012CJQYQ", "B0036EH3XE", "B0013DZNAA", "B00005JNEQ", "B003F3NDP8", "B0002XVKMM", "B001VPJYZK", "B000FFJYBQ", "B001MVWRMK", "B0007P0Y7C", "B0053O8A46", "B000FUTVLO", "B0019Z3P84", "B0047BXR9E", "B000244E2O", "B000LE178Y", "B000MX7V66", "B00022FWEU", "B000GPIPTM", "B000EOTV98", "B001QE99AQ", "B002WQ79A4", "B003UD7JEE", "B00133QNS6", "B000N3T0EG", "B001C4CI8U", "6302020190", "B000FIMG5Y", "B005FISC3Y"], "bought_together": ["B001MVWRNO", "B001MVWRMU"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001MVWRMK", "B001MVWRMU", "B001MVWRNO", "B001MVWRN4"]}, "price": 24.97, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 116630}, "asin": "B0001I55ZQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51VZVC3SX7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Alias - The Complete Third Season"}

{"description": "A funny thing happens to audiences when they see Pablo Francisco live for the first time. In a matter of minutes, crowds go from the quiet response that often greets a Pablo Strutting relative unknown, to jolts of boisterous laughter and applause.What accounts for the transformation? Namely the 20-something Tucson native's ability to create vividly funny living pictures using strikingly authentic off-the-wall sound effects and loads of his own ample imagination.Pablo's send-up of grimly narrated action-movie previews, with Arnold Schwarzenegger as a tortilla vendor targeted by the mob, is one good example. Another is his hilarious spoofing of those intensely melodramatic Spanish language soap operas on the Telemundo Cable Network.A lifelong comedy junkie, as kid Pablo competed with a friend to see who could video tape more comics from television. He got his first professional break at age 17, when he and his aforementioned buddy formed a duo called the \"Blowout Boys,\" snuck into a local steakhouse and took honors in a comedy competition against older, but clearly inferior opponents. \"A lot of them read their stuff from notes. At least we had memorized our material!\" recalls Pablo.From humble beginnings, big things have started to happen. He is host of S&#xED; TV&#x92;s Latino Laugh Festival: The Show and was a Mad TV cast member. He has also appeared on The Tonight Show With Jay Leno, HBO&#x92;s Loco Slam, Showtime&#x92;s Full Frontal Comedy and Comedy Central Presents. Pablo, now an LA resident, is busy distinguishing himself in top clubs around the country, with more than 250 dates a year.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000I2J6YQ", "B005GP7F4S", "B002HK9IMC", "B000001ZGJ", "B0007NMJRW", "B000NO23VW", "B000C20VIW", "B0019F030C", "B002L9N4YW", "B000P6R6Y2", "B001D2WUDO", "B000GRUN40", "B000CR8QRU", "B000Y7U99G", "B000IU37TS", "B006MHZH5I", "B000JJSKZY", "B000A0GOUU", "B008H4MFSG", "B003X3BY8I", "B001FRNB94", "B000QFAFNQ", "B004ODLUE4", "B003BJO8I2", "B000GW8RYS", "B001PKHS90", "B001HB1K0A", "B001AXU1FK", "B0069NPEX0", "B001BEK88I", "B0000CEB6B", "B002L9N4Z6", "B008MA7R7Y", "B003HTPHUE", "B0046ZYEUC", "B002TQKL0W", "B001HB1JY2", "B005SHBO1Y", "B0000DZ3HR", "B003G715ZS", "B001EHDSUM"], "bought_together": ["B005GP7F4S", "B000001ZGJ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005GP7F4S", "B000I2J6YQ", "B006MHZH5I", "B000QFAFNQ"]}, "price": 13.0, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 83454}, "asin": "B00028G6MQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51SA01ZV06L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Pablo Francisco - Bits And Pieces: Live From Orange County"}

{"description": "An indictment of the British class system dressed up like a Ralph Lauren ad,Another Countryis the movie that made a very young and very gorgeous Rupert Everett a star. Whatever other ideas it has knocking around its head (and there are quite a lot of them), director Marek Kanievska's adaptation of Julian Mitchell's play is first and foremost a star vehicle for Everett, who played the openly gay main character with a vigor, flair, and smoldering appeal that was rarely seen onscreen in the early '80s. Everett is Guy Bennett, a charming, confident schoolboy in 1930s England who yearns to climb to the top of the social strata at his Eton-like school. His ambitions, however, are waylaid by the young and equally gorgeous James Harcourt (Cary Elwes), with whom he begins a passionate yet secret affair. Soon, however, Guy finds that balancing his love and his ambition is a no-win situation, and that no matter how hard he bucks against it, the ages-old traditional structures of British class and etiquette won't yield in his wake. Added to all this E.M. Forster-style drama and romance is the fact that Guy later on becomes a spy for the Russians against England; it's a weighty theme to drop on the movie, and the fact that it's a true story just shows how less than artfully the film unfolds. Still, holding it all together is the sublime Everett, who took this persona of the classy, beautiful, passionate, British gay man and ran with it throughout the '80s and '90s. With Colin Firth as Everett's Marxist (and heterosexual) compatriot.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004GEB64K", "B004RIACU4", "B0001ADB64", "B0000C23D5", "B0056G1ANE", "B0046ZYEUW", "B000056N8V", "B00996RSYM", "B004ALIG4M", "B001Y7CVXC", "B007VHCJR2", "B000DZ8540", "B00E849QSG", "B00GHP8SH4", "B00F98FOPE", "B002OVED88", "B00I4CWIVU", "B000I2J6WI", "B00K6DQGC2", "B002WY65UQ", "B009SFR2QI", "B000CR7R7K", "B004JTGXFO", "B00J5LXQX8", "B004L03B3S", "B00KO76FSA", "B003VE9WPG", "B00J0IN6Z4", "B0015HOKKS", "B003VA3JTK", "B004XKUFY4", "B0083V2VYG", "B0002I84JO", "B002I5GNZQ", "B005CFC0HE", "B0084BM7NK", "B005HI4LMI", "6305692696", "B000VKL6ZM", "B004U7MQZ6", "B00FPVGWY2", "B00HHYF5EI", "B001AOC9K4", "B0017WI5TS", "6305779619", "B005GP7ELW", "B0019MFY2C", "B000VKJ6UE", "B003IG06PM", "B00006FDBN", "B000267776", "B00HUQCA28", "B0042KZJFA", "B000L21286", "B001CT05N0", "B0000ARD7O", "B007OXB1GI", "B008N25X7M", "B00HZ67OOW", "B00J2T18MY", "B002SSNFUO", "B0080JX4Y2", "B0000639HT", "B000ERVJQ8", "B00JJRLG7G", "B00015YVI6", "148056009X", "B0000E6FOP", "B00657PLN8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004GEB64K", "B004RIACU4", "B0056G1ANE", "B00G6HO368"]}, "price": 17.98, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 198008}, "asin": "B0002ABUNY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DPG4E2X1L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Another Country"}
{"description": "After one episode ofThe Wireyou'll be hooked. After three, you'll be astonished by the precision of its storytelling. After viewing all 13 episodes of the HBO series' remarkable first season, you'll be cheering a bona-fide American masterpiece. Series creator David Simon was a veteran crime reporter fromThe Baltimore Sunwho cowrote thebookthat inspired TV'sHomicide, and cowriter Ed Burns was a Baltimore cop, lending impeccable street-cred to an inner-city Baltimore saga (and companion piece toThe Corner) that Simon aptly describes as \"a visual novel\" and \"a treatise on institutions and individuals\" as opposed to a conventional good-vs.-evil police procedural. Owing a creative debt to the novels of Richard Price (especiallyClockers), the series opens as maverick Detective Jimmy McNulty (Dominic West, in a star-making role) is tapping into a vast network of drugs and death around southwest Baltimore's deteriorating housing projects. With a mandate to get results ASAP, a haphazard team is assembled to join McNulty's increasingly complex investigation, built upon countless hours of electronic surveillance.The show's split-perspective plotting is so richly layered, so breathtakingly authentic and based on finely drawn characters brought to life by a perfect ensemble cast, that it defies concise description. Simon, Burns, and their cowriters control every intricate aspect of the unfolding epic; directors are top-drawer (including Clark Johnson, helmer ofThe Shield's finest episodes), but they are servants to the story, resulting in a TV series like no other: unpredictable, complicated, and demanding the viewer's rapt attention,The Wireis \"an angry show\" (in Simon's words) that refuses to comfort with easy answers to deep-rooted societal problems. Moral gray zones proliferate in a universe where ruthless killers have a logical code, and where the cops are just as ambiguous as their targets. That ambiguity extends to the ending as well; season 1 leaves several issues unresolved, leaving you begging for the even more impressive developments that await in season 2.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0006IUD9Y", "B000FTCLSU", "B000QXDJLI", "B00123BY6S", "B004YOEDR4", "B00316DDYA", "B00005Y6YJ", "B00003CXOP", "B003Y5HWJU", "B001DJLCRC", "B005SEDI5M", "B00BC5I6Q2", "B00J5LXT44", "B0000Y40PW", "B00HUCF420", "B00000FBH2", "B0060MYKYY", "B0012CJQY6", "B00EEDNR9A", "B002AMUDK8", "B001RTSPVY", "0802144993", "B00HW3EXCE", "B0058YPG1G", "B00BVMXBDO", "B00031TYBC", "B00KHWSD1O", "B00FCOTRV2", "B001DW2BFQ", "B0032UYFA6", "B00HGE90Z4", "B000G1R4TS", "B00ECGHM5O", "B0055CP9UY", "B0012CJQYG", "B000NA1VI2", "B0038M2APA", "B0012CJQYQ", "B009LDCZ7I", "B0009GV9E6", "B0060MYM3S", "B0009K7RMA", "B00FEP9MYG", "B0015TX2LO", "B0011VJRVU", "B00ECHBSP8", "B0047H7QD6", "B00B5J6A7W", "B0020TS5EM", "B009VXVMAO", "B004YM6JVO", "B00C8CQRQ4", "B00HUCF7AO", "B001IBIDLI", "B000BO7DWI", "B000KLQUUS", "B004TJ1GY2", "B00FGEO9NE", "B00DJYJRHG", "B0019LY5IM", "B008CLI4N4", "B00I9MS86O", "B00C888LOO", "B00007KLE8", "B0094UOI64", "B004X1VUNI", "B001AQO3WY", "B00DNR3FN6", "B0038M2AQ4", "B002BLNGTS", "B004132HZS", "B00BNH9NCU", "B00BGI076M", "B00BUUAV08", "B00HOGBXS6", "B004HW7JO2", "B00BTRKMNI", "B00BC5FN2C", "B00000I73E", "B000FP2OPY", "B002CPMB9O", "B00CWIMVDW", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B000YABIQ6", "B005DVIOIG", "B00EIXWW2O", "B00HUCF6KK", "B0007YMVWO", "B00G4Q3KOC", "B00DW5IKN4", "B00AB55BS0", "B000P0J09M", "B001IBIHQ4", "B00AEFYG3S", "B001GCUER0", "B003EYVXTG", "B00005JNOG", "B000MGBSE4", "B00H7LJ2UO", "B00CDTSFF8"], "bought_together": ["B0006IUD9Y", "B000FTCLSU"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005NFJAWG", "B0006IUD9Y", "B00BC5I6Q2", "B001DJLCRC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 3788}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 22.99, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B0002ERXC2", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/511fyhhxpWL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Wire: Season 1"}

Cady first befriends a couple of art-punk outsiders who persuade her to infiltrate the Plastics and destroy them from within--but power corrupts, and Cady soon finds the glory of being a Plastic to be seductive.Mean Girlsjoins the ranks ofClueless,Bring It On, andHeathers, cunning movies that use the hormone-pressurized high school milieu to put the dark impulses of human nature--ambition, envy, lust, revenge--under a comic microscope. Fey manages to skewer everyone without forgetting the characters' hapless humanity; it's a dazzling and delightful balancing act.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEFXO8Q", "B0036TGSIK", "B00AEBB8R4", "B00AEFYMBO", "B008JFUUIA", "B00005JMCW", "B000J4QW7W", "B00003CXMP", "B00005O5CM", "B00466HN7M", "B00441GYVK", "B00005JN0Z", "B0018CNNV2", "B00447L4KA", "B00AG473GE", "B001AEF6BS", "B003Y5H574", "B00AEFXXMI", "B00008K7AM", "B000CEV3KU", "B00006ZXSL", "B001AEF6BI", "B001OQCUYI", "B0000DIXDR", "B0053TWVQ4", "B00AEFY99O", "B003NHRIVQ", "B00AEBBA2M", "B000GB775E", "B001BL96K2", "B00E8RKHWW", "B004SIP9X8", "B00AEFXUXU", "B001H1I8KK", "B0007LXPBI", "B0007LXPBS", "B006X08DZ0", "B00001PE4D", "B000324Y98", "B006TTC50Y", "B000YAA68C", "B00002SSKI", "B000P0J0A6", "B002GIBVQ6", "6305428425", "B00000F0AD", "B00164KYV4", "B00007E2F5", "B000FCW15A", "B0035Q637K", "B000683VI4", "B003Y5H52O", "B00005JM55", "B00062IVN0", "B00005MEVO", "B00AEFY5TI", "B004EPYZU8", "B0002VYOVI", "B001MM3AZM", "B004EPZ0BG", "B00AMEZDJW", "B005Z9MFRC", "B000J103OI", "B000FS9MXI", "B0041KKYGU", "B0007PALZ2", "B004P7CN7W", "B000P0J09W", "6302077818", "B00005JNBQ", "B003TY2SWC", "B00AEBB9F0", "B002ZG989G", "B001UV4XUG", "0783235070", "B002ZG9968", "B000A2X3U2", "B004EPZ084", "B002DOBGWM", "B00AEFXZJE", "B0001I563M", "B0009OL7Z4", "B00028HBES", "B00404ME2Y", "B002ZG976U", "B003B3V0N4", "B0007PLLBU", "B000AM4P9A", "B005LAII12", "B002K0WBXW", "B00AEFXE9U", "B000Z8GZYW", "B00AEFYQE2", "B003B1X85O", "B00081U7HC", "B00AEFY0F2", "B003Y5H5B0", "B000YDBPAM", "B00004Y2R1", "B0006TPE4C"], "bought_together": ["B00AEFXO8Q"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B008JFUUIA", "B0036TGSIK", "B00AEBB8R4", "B00466HN7M"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 81958}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.97, "brand": "Paramount", "asin": "B0002IQJ8W", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510H7MK4TXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Mean Girls (Widescreen Edition)"}

Robin Williams' powerful portrayal of Alan Hackman, a troubled \"cutter,\" propels this character driven story that forces us to question the power of our memories and the sanctity of our privacy", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00007976U", "B000HC2LZS", "B0002HOEPI", "B0099KGJPC", "B002AK9URM", "B00DCRE87O", "B002U0KHNS", "B000A50442", "B004SUDQB8", "B003LR5BD0", "B00005NRO0", "B00096S49Y", "B0007N19X2", "B001EAWMGA", "B00062IVOY", "B0043X1FM2", "B00005PJ8T", "B000LC5B7O", "B00004YA66", "B00005JPD0", "B000J3FBDO", "630587493X", "B000N4RAR4", "B00006ADFM", "B00008L3U1", "B00J4LMHMK", "B003ELMR9E", "B00005QCTY", "B0031DDGA4", "B002PI1NRO", "B009LDD1H6", "B0006IIKQW", "B00HGB9NB8", "B000N6UERK", "B000FDEVA2", "1404104968", "B00005NKT5", "B00015YVDG", "B00005JN0T", "6305144168", "B000B8QG22", "B0006IIPIK", "B004SIP7ZS", "0718024133", "B00CPTUO3W", "B00FEVZH8K", "B0043X1FL8", "6305262128", "B000BYA4IS", "B00005JLX2", "B000HT38DU", "B003PIUIIS", "B002NZK5UK", "0783241909", "B002ZG97CO", "B00000IQV7", "B00003CXXP", "B00005V9HT", "B0053O8AKU", "B00005JL78", "B009TTGM3C", "6304584210", "B00319ECBK", "B00BNWWVFG", "B000I0RNXY", "B00151QYXU", "B00008MTVY", "0767821629", "B00BN3EE28", "B00BZZMXMW", "B00FEVZJ2O", "B00003CXQA", "B001L67A4G", "B00JPUUSSU", "B000056WRE", "B005TBQS0Q", "B00H1RMWYW", "0767819764", "B001AZIRYA", "B001KMB6X2", "B0000YTOL2", "B000031EGV", "B002DU39GW", "B00368PSN2", "B005LAII8A", "0792846486", "B0017RFY56", "B000ARFPNK", "B003Y5H4ZW", "B0018O4SOQ", "B00029RT9E", "B000077VQ6", "B0007OCG5Q", "B001UV4X8S", "B0085A9HU6", "B003EV6DCG", "B000EQ5T1K", "B004BW1ZIO", "B0000633R5", "B002UZCJP2"], "bought_together": ["B00007976U"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00007976T", "B003LR5BD0", "B00DCRE87O", "B0099KGJPC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 49447}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.99, "brand": "WILLIAMS,ROBIN", "asin": "B00079HZOS", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51K9HMVTMVL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Final Cut"}

{"description": "North and South is a powerful adaptation of Elizabeth Gaskell's feisty and passionate novel, set across the social divides in the changing world of Victorian industrial society. Margaret Hale is one of literature's most original heroines: a southerner from a country vicarage newly settled in the industrial northern town of Milton. In the shock of her move, she misjudges charismatic cotton mill-owner John Thornton, whose strength of purpose and passion are a match for her own pride and wilfulness. When the workers of Milton call a strike, Margaret takes their side, and the two are brought into deeper conflict. As events spiral out of control, Margaret - to her surprise - begins to fall in love with Thornton... \nDVD Extras: Specially recorded interview with Richard Armitage, Commentary on Episodes 1 & 4 with Kate Bartlett, Brian Percival and Sandy Welch, Deleted Scenes & Production Notes", "related": {"also_bought": ["0140434240", "B000GIXLUC", "B000SINSVC", "B002XTBECY", "B00062IZ0Y", "B002XTBE6K", "B003TY2SUO", "B000M2E32M", "B000Z27HLS", "B000784WNQ", "B00AF82WTO", "B00CEBJC20", "B001PU8N0I", "B00005JOA0", "B0012OVCE6", "B000LPQ6DE", "B002HWRZTI", "B000E0ODZE", "B00G6HO368", "B00003JRCQ", "B00065GVIO", "B00005YUNK", "B000EBD9VC", "B0009PVZM8", "B004TPJN2S", "B004AUCDLU", "B0000AQS3P", "146368343X", "B0012Q3T6I", "B004JMSIQS", "B000A8AXXG", "B001P807RC", "B000M2E32C", "B0053Q9DHW", "B004K4FUUC", "B003TY2STA", "B001PJRAUS", "B00065GX96", "B005T0OY5S", "B000784WMW", "B003BL4394", "1491570296", "B002VWOMZ4", "B0031RAP5Y", "B004XVMCMQ", "1934648248", "B0080QOL10", "B002EWD0I6", "1496178696", "B007A2O3FO", "B000BNTMKK", "B00D49YEHO", "B00140PK6O", "B003WEAW18", "B000089QEM", "B000PSR3N4", "B00G6HO3OA", "B000E1ZBGS", "B000WVPXAO", "B00E3UN66I", "B009L2EW5W", "0800141660", "B0039WHKE0", "B004P7CNZO", "1843793792", "B0013NAMLK", "B00A8KJMP6", "B007701RFS", "B00G7QPXAI", "B004FM2EL2", "B0009PVZL4", "B000BITVAG", "B004JMSIVI", "B000244FDW", "B00094AS9U", "B008N25XAE", "B000GRUQKQ", "B001PU8O5W", "B00BC0JGUW", "B00DW5ILF6", "B00005O7N8", "1613823436", "B00HWWUQWQ", "9626349255", "B005LAJ140", "B000Z27HMW", "B0002ZH5PQ", "B000A2W1X2", "B00HUAGZ34", "B0031RAP5O", "014043478X", "B00F1BFRA6", "B004SIP7AS", "B00HUAH14Q", "B00FXWL9QO", "B00BOTCJXC", "B0007OY2P8", "B00BEZTMFY", "1482795701", "B00JJRLFTU"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004EXWGIS", "B00141188M", "0140434240", "B00003JRCQ"]}, "price": 25.01, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 205793}, "asin": "B0007N1BBC", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510RD1NQkmL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "North &amp; South (Complete BBC Series) [Region 2] [UK Import]"}

{"description": "From Hollywood's legendary Cocoanut Grove to the pioneering conquest of the wild blue yonder, Martin Scorsese'sThe Aviatorcelebrates old-school filmmaking at its finest. We say \"old school\" only because Scorsese's love of golden-age Hollywood is evident in his approach to his subject--Howard Hughes in his prime (played by Leonardo DiCaprio in his)--and especially in his technical mastery of the medium reflecting his love for classical filmmaking of the studio era. Even when he's using state-of-the-art digital trickery for the film's exciting flight scenes (including one of the most spectacular crashes ever filmed), Scorsese's meticulous attention to art direction and costume design suggests an impassioned pursuit of craftsmanship from a bygone era; every frame seems to glow with gilded detail. And while DiCaprio bears little physical resemblance to Hughes during the film's 20-year span (late 1920s to late '40s), he efficiently captures the eccentric millionaire's golden-boy essence, and his tragic descent into obsessive-compulsive seclusion. Bolstered by Cate Blanchett's uncannily accurate portrayal of Katharine Hepburn as Hughes' most beloved lover,The Aviatoris easily Scorsese's most accessible film, inviting mainstream popularity without compromising Scorsese's artistic reputation. As compelling crowd-pleasers go, it's a class act from start to finish.--Jeff ShannonDVD FeaturesIn his commentary track, director Martin Scorsese offers his own impressions of Howard Hughes and rattles off his memories of experiencing Hughes's films.  He mentions how he made Cate Blanchett watch every Katharine Hepburn film from the '30s on the big screen, and observes that Kate Beckinsale had \"a real sense of the stature of a Hollywood goddess.\"  But in general he doesn't talk much about the craft of making the film.  That area is covered better by editor Thelma Schoonmaker, who also appears on the commentary track, and producer Michael Mann makes a few appearances (all were recorded separately).  The picture is brilliant, but the 5.1 sound is not as aggressive in the rear speakers and subwoofer as one might expect, other than some nice surround effects in theHell's Angelsflying sequence.The second disc collects almost three hours of features.  There's one unnecessary deleted scene, and an 11-minute making-of featurette that's basically the cast and director heaping praise on each other.  More interesting are the short featurettes on visual effects (including the XF-11 scene, of course), production design, costumes, hair and makeup, and score, and Loudon Wainwright discusses his and his children's musical performances.  Historical perspective is provided by spotlights on Hughes's role in aviation and his obsessive-compulsive disorder, and a 43-minute Hughes documentary from the History Channel (part of the Modern Marvels series, it focuses on his mechanical innovations and spends less than a minute on his movies).  More unusual are DiCaprio and Scorsese's appearance on an OCD panel, and a half-hour interview segment DiCaprio did with Alan Alda.--David HoriuchiThe Personalities ofThe AviatorClick the links to explore more movies by these stars.Leonardo DiCaprioasHoward Hughes\"Sometimes I truly fear that I... am losing my mind.

{"description": "Joan Crawford bashes her way through this melodrama inspired by the Bugsy Siegel-Virginia Hill story. Our girl walks out of tacky poverty at the beginning and re-shapes herself into a fur-lined mobster's moll, her will of steel out-pointing the men at every stop. David Brian (recently herFlamingo Roadco-star) is the looming blond monster who runs the organization, Steve Cochran is the Bugsy guy building his own network in Nevada, and Kent Smith is the meek accountant Joan bullies into becoming a syndicate player. It's all from that mid-career post-Mildred Pierceperiod that served Crawford so well, with the full-on film noir look (Ted McCord photographed) and the strong whiff of American sleaze.Joan Crawford's face had assumed its masklike quality at this point, and at times she seems more of a business manager than an actress:  organizing each scene, pushing the story along to its next stop. In its own over-the-top way, it works:  there isn't a moment when she doesn't seem capable of devouring anybody that stands in her way. Everything is writ large in this movie, which makes it a fitting target for a Carol Burnett send-up... and which also makes it a great deal of fun.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0008ENICA", "B0008ENI98", "B0010KHOSK", "B0008ENIAC", "B006X0ZN3K", "B00000IPHP", "B00AG6NO7O", "B0007PALUM", "B00DSAUKKY", "B00AEBBA7W", "B00C3ALM02", "B000EXDSBG", "B000RXVND8", "B000EXDSBQ", "B0012OX7DA", "B0087ZG7OI", "B0008ENIDE", "B00KIZYDCI", "B0008ENIDO", "B00027JYLM", "B00C3ALKWM", "B00005RDRP", "B00023P4GA", "B00I9BU3M2", "B002EAYE9W", "B00EKGX2P0", "B009X919UE", "B001CQONHW", "B00I9BU60Q", "B00276T2KO", "B004LB5FEA", "B001D5DQHK", "B000055XM8", "B00023P4G0", "B00004RER5", "B00FPUN21O", "B008BSM1CI", "B00004XPPK", "B00AQ6J5YA", "B0010KHOSA", "B004RA5AU4", "B0089LT7ZG", "B002ID094Y", "B002YNQEFG", "B002YNQEF6", "B001CC7PM6", "B00466JALY", "B00AEFXRWO", "B00266UX6W", "B000068TPG", "B00KIZY2QA", "B005152C9G", "B0007ZEO8C", "B00EL6A7XE", "B004H83IFU", "B001D8W7EK", "B00CVB6XF2", "B0082LUEFA", "B000JF5T5W", "B006TXDNEW", "B0041URXZK", "B0024FAG80", "B000XNZ7NO", "B0000549B1", "B00I04SVV8", "6305999872", "B00J2PQYG8", "B001QFFBAM", "B0009OL8IK", "B00EL6A9CI", "B000EU1Q2C", "B000E8JO32", "B000E6ESWG", "B0000AZKO7", "B000KGGJ1I", "B000B8384Q", "B00AB2NX1K", "B0008ENICU", "B0026ZQJP2", "B0026RCJHM", "B00004W19C", "B000LN6UHI", "B00DZP1C9K", "B000EU1Q22", "B003B3V0X4", "B00074DY0W", "B000KJTGFG", "B0026ZQJT8", "B0009S4IKQ", "B000244EZ6", "B000B83846", "B0047BXR1C", "B000N3T0H8", "B00AB2NX4M", "B0006UEVVI", "B0012KSUV8", "B002TOL4B4", "B000PKG6OE", "B001CC7PLW", "B000KHI2FS"], "bought_together": ["B0008ENICA", "B0008ENI98"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0008ENID4", "0877973067", "B0008ENIAC", "B0008ENI98"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 31248}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.91, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B0008ENI84", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/512HMdtuA4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Damned Don't Cry"}

{"description": "Masterpiece indeed. With 14 films, each supplemented with numerous documentaries, commentaries, and other bonus materials,Alfred Hitchcock - The Masterpiece Collectionwill be the cornerstone for any serious DVD library. Packaged in a beautiful, conversation-starting velvet box, the individual discs inside come four to a case, decorated with original poster art.No doubt opinionated fans will argue about what should fall under the rubric of \"masterpiece\" in Hitchcock's body of work, but with the bona fide classicsVertigo,Psycho, andThe Man Who Knew Too Much, there's plenty of timeless movie magic here. Eye-popping transfers and gorgeous sound make this set one of the must-have releases of the year.Should the Hitchcock fan have the energy for more after imbibing on the movies themselves, a bonus disc provides additional documentaries. These include a revealing interview in which the master of suspense discusses, among other things, how much he dislikes working with method actors, going so far as to name names (we're talking about you, Jimmy Stewart and Montgomery Clift). In an American Film Institute lifetime achievement ceremony, the master of suspense is praised by the likes of Stewart and Ingrid Bergman, and seems to be suffering from severe boredom as celebrities pile on the flattery. Then Hitchcock opens his mouth to accept the award, delivering an endlessly witty stream of perfect bon mots that prove once again that he was a master of high comedy as well. Revealing documentaries about the making ofPsychoandThe Birdsround out the feast of extras. The 36-page booklet, filled mostly with stills and poster art, provides little new information about the films.--Ryan BoudinotFilms Included inAlfred Hitchcock - The Masterpiece CollectionSaboteurRobert Cummings stars as Barry Kane, a patriotic munitions worker who is falsely accused of sabotage, in this wartime thriller from Alfred Hitchcock. Plastered across the front page of every newspaper and hated by the nation, Kane's only hope of clearing his name is to find the real villain. The script as a whole is a clever one--Algonquin wit Dorothy Parker shares a screenwriting credit, and her trademark zingers make for a terrific mix of humor and suspense.Saboteuris a pleasure whether you're a die-hard Hitchcock fan or just someone who likes a good nail-biter.--Ali DavisShadow of a DoubtAlfred Hitchcock considered this 1943 thriller to be his personal favorite among his own films, and although it's not as popular as some of Hitchcock's later work, it's certainly worthy of the master's admiration. Scripted by playwright Thornton Wilder and inspired by the actual case of a 1920's serial killer known as \"The Merry Widow Murderer,\" the movie sets a tone of menace and fear by introducing a psychotic killer into the small-town comforts of Santa Rosa, California. Through narrow escapes and a climactic scene aboard a speeding train, this witty thriller strips away the fa&#xE7;ade of small-town tranquility to reveal evil where it's least expected. And, of course, it's all done in pure Hitchcockian style.--Jeff ShannonRopeAn experimental film masquerading as a standard Hollywood thriller,Ropeis simple and based on a successful stage play: two young men (John Dall and Farley Granger) commit murder, more or less as an intellectual exercise. They hide the body in their large apartment, then throw a dinner party. Will the body be discovered? Director Alfred Hitchcock, fascinated by the possibilities of the long-take style, decided to shoot this story as though it were happening in one long, uninterrupted shot. Since the camera can only hold one 10-minute reel at a time, Hitchcock had to be creative when it came time to change reels, disguising the switches as the camera passed behind someone's back or moved behind a lamp. James Stewart, as a suspicious professor, marks his first starring role for Hitchcock, a collaboration that would lead to the masterpiecesRear WindowandVertigo.--Robert HortonRear WindowLike the Greenwich Village courtyard view from its titular portal, Alfred Hitchcock's classicRear Windowis both confined and multileveled: both its story and visual perspective are dictated by its protagonist's imprisonment in his apartment, convalescing in a wheelchair, from which both he and the audience observe the lives of his neighbors. Cheerful voyeurism, as well as the behavior glimpsed among the various tenants, affords a droll comic atmosphere that gradually darkens when he sees clues to what may be a murder. At deeper levels,Rear Windowplumbs issues of moral responsibility and emotional honesty, while offering further proof (were any needed) of the director's brilliance as a visual storyteller.--Sam SutherlandThe Trouble with HarryA busman's holiday for Alfred Hitchcock, this 1955 black comedy concerns a pesky corpse that becomes a problem for a quiet, Vermont neighborhood. Shirley MacLaine makes her film debut as one of several characters who keep burying the body and finding it unburied again. Hitchcock clearly enjoys conjuring the autumnal look and feel of the story, and he establishes an important, first-time alliance with composer Bernard Herrmann, whose music proved vital to the director's next half-dozen or so films. But for now,The Trouble with Harryis a lark, the mischievous side of Hitchcock given free reign.--Tom KeoghThe Man Who Knew Too MuchAlfred Hitchcock's 1956 remake of his own 1934 spy thriller is an exciting event in its own right, with several justifiably famous sequences. James Stewart and Doris Day play American tourists who discover more than they wanted to know about an assassination plot. When their son is kidnapped to keep them quiet, they are caught between concern for him and the terrible secret they hold. When asked about the difference between this version of the story and the one he made 22 years earlier, Hitchcock always said the first was the work of a talented amateur while the second was the act of a seasoned professional. Indeed, several extraordinary moments in this update represent consummate filmmaking, particularly a relentlessly exciting Albert Hall scene, with a blaring symphony, an assassin's gun, and Doris Day's scream.The Man Who Knew Too Muchis the work of a master in his prime.--Tom KeoghVertigoAlthough it wasn't a box-office success when originally released in 1958,Vertigohas since taken its deserved place as Alfred Hitchcock's greatest, most spellbinding, most deeply personal achievement. James Stewart plays a retired police detective who is hired by an old friend to follow his wife (a superb Kim Novak, in what becomes a double role), whom he suspects of being possessed by the spirit of a dead madwoman. Shot around San Francisco (the Golden Gate Bridge and the Palace of the Legion of Honor are significant locations) and elsewhere in Northern California (the redwoods, Mission San Juan Batista) in rapturous Technicolor,Vertigois as lovely as it is haunting.--Jim EmersonPsychoFor all the slasher pictures that have ripped offPsycho(and particularly its classic set piece, the \"shower scene\"), nothing has ever matched the impact of the real thing. More than just a first-rate shocker full of thrills and suspense,Psychois also an engrossing character study in which director Alfred Hitchcock skillfully seduces you into identifying with the main characters--then pulls the rug (or the bathmat) out from under you. Anthony Perkins is unforgettable as Norman Bates, the mama's boy proprietor of the Bates Motel; and so is Janet Leigh as Marion Crane, who makes an impulsive decision and becomes a fugitive from the law, hiding out at Norman's roadside inn for one fateful night.--Jim EmersonThe BirdsVacationing in northern California, Alfred Hitchcock was struck by a story in a Santa Cruz newspaper: \"Seabird Invasion Hits Coastal Homes.\" From this peculiar incident, and his memory of a short story by Daphne du Maurier, the master of suspense created one of his strangest and most terrifying films.The Birdsfollows a chic blonde, Melanie Daniels (Tippi Hedren), as she travels to the coastal town of Bodega Bay to hook up with a rugged fellow (Rod Taylor) she's only just met. Before long the town is attacked by marauding birds, and Hitchcock's skill at staging action is brought to the fore. Beyond the superb effects, however,The Birdsis also one of Hitchcock's most psychologically complicated scenarios, a tense study of violence, loneliness, and complacency. What really gets under your skin are not the bird skirmishes but the anxiety and the eerie quiet between attacks. Treated with scant attention by serious critics in 1963,The Birdshas grown into a classic and--despite the sci-fi trappings--one of Hitchcock's most serious films.--Robert HortonMarnieSean Connery, fresh from the second Bond picture,From Russia with Love, is a Philadelphia playboy who begins to fall for Tippi Hedren's blonde ice goddess only when he realizes that she's a professional thief; she's come to work in his upper-crust insurance office in order to embezzle mass quantities. His patient program of investigation and surveillance has a creepy, voyeuristic quality that's pure Hitchcock, but all's lost when it emerges that the root of Marnie's problem is phobic sexual frigidity, induced by a childhood trauma. Luckily, Sean is up to the challenge. As it were. Not even D.H. Lawrence believed as fervently as Hitchcock in the curative properties of sexual release.--David ChuteTorn CurtainPaul Newman and Julie Andrews star in what must unfortunately be called one of Alfred Hitchcock's lesser efforts. Still, sub-par Hitchcock is better than a lot of what's out there, and this one is well worth a look. Newman plays cold war physicist Michael Armstrong, while Andrews plays his lovely assistant-and-fianc&#xE9;e, Sarah Sherman. Armstrong has been working on a missile defense system that will \"make nuclear defense obsolete,\" and naturally both sides are very interested. All Sarah cares about is the fact that Michael has been acting awfully fishy lately. The suspense ofTorn Curtainis by nature not as thrilling as that in the average Hitchcock film--much of it involves sitting still and wondering if the bad guys are getting closer. Still, Hitchcock manages to amuse himself: there is some beautifully clever camera work and an excruciating sequence that illustrates the frequent Hitchcock point that death is not a tidy business.--Ali DavisTopazAlfred Hitchcock hadn't made a spy thriller since the 1930s, so his 1969 adaptation of Leon Uris's bestseller seemed like a curious choice for the director. But Hitchcock makes Uris's story of the West's investigation into the Soviet Union's dealings with Cuba his own. Frederick Stafford plays a French intelligence agent who works with his American counterpart (John Forsythe) to break up a Soviet spy ring. The film is a bit flat dramatically and visually, and there are sequences that seem to occupy Hitchcock's attention more than others. A minor work all around, with at least two alternative endings shot by Hitchcock.--Tom KeoghFrenzyAlfred Hitchcock's penultimate film, written by Anthony Shaffer (who also wroteSleuth), this delightfully grisly little tale features an all-British cast minus star wattage, which may have accounted for its relatively slim showing in the States. Jon Finch plays a down-on-his-luck Londoner who is offered some help by an old pal (Barry Foster). In fact, Foster is a serial killer the police have been chasing--and he's framing Finch. Which leads to a classic Hitchcock situation: a guiltless man is forced to prove his innocence while eluding Scotland Yard at the same time. Spiked with Hitchcock's trademark dark humor,Frenzyalso features a very funny subplot about the Scotland Yard investigator (Alec McCowen) in charge of the case, who must endure meals by a wife (Vivien Merchant) who is taking a gourmet-cooking class.--Marshall FineFamily PlotAlfred Hitchcock's final film is understated comic fun that mixes suspense with deft humor, thanks to a solid cast. The plot centers on the kidnapping of an heir and a diamond theft by a pair of bad guys led by Karen Black and William Devane. The cops seem befuddled, but that doesn't stop a questionable psychic (Barbara Harris) and her not overly bright boyfriend (Bruce Dern, in a rare good-guy role) from picking up the trail and actually solving the crime. Did she do it with actual psychic powers? That's part of the fun of Harris's enjoyably ditsy performance.--Marshall Fine", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0045HCJ9E", "B002GSXKQA", "B00AEBB97S", "B000UVV25Q", "B0002HOEPS", "B0002HOEQ2", "B000A9QK7I", "B00IOFMZYM", "B001D8W7EK", "B001D8W7F4", "B0002HOERG", "B00000CQJZ", "B002945DUM", "B001D8W7EU", "B000AARK30", "B000AL733G", "B000TXPXD2", "B005EVY8MQ", "B005UL4NF2", "B00000C0QO", "B000HDR814", "B007FQXEVY", "B002NPY7GS", "B00AQMGQVY", "B001D8W7EA", "B000KJU12S", "B001KXZGO6", "B006TTC5WC", "B001FBV4T4", "B003B3V0RA", "B004K4FUT8", "B006H37PXY", "0671604295", "0060988274", "B000K6GM4W", "B002GSXKPQ", "B00FEOYY8G", "B009RWRINE", "B00ARA4SLU", "0385418132", "B001FBNQYA", "B0017HMF6W", "B0006Z2NSG", "B0050FXDDQ", "B002ID098A", "B003USBF3K", "6305999872", "B0012Q3T5O", "B007FQXEQO", "B0002NRRRE", "B002945DU2", "B001EXE2Y2", "B004UOHNAC", "B00005JKGX", "B002945DWA", "B000MGBSDK", "B0087ZG7OI", "B0002HOEQW", "B00BOM98PG", "B005HK13S6", "B000FFJYAW", "B006TTC5J0", "B002VWNIAY", "B000BMY2LU", "B000BQ5IXW", "B00AD4KE8G", "B003UN2I4K", "B008D1R52Y", "B00004TWZH", "B00000JNUZ", "B0057T66UW", "B00004XPPK", "B000FTCLRQ", "B005F265CU", "B0002B15ZG", "B00AEBB89C", "B0006Z2NS6", "B002ID098U", "B0001HAGTW", "B000244F2S", "B000KIX8VK", "B005AMJ3B0", "B008FYZJ2C", "B001KXZGOG", "B0002HOEQM", "B001T21R50", "B000CEXEWA", "B000FI9OCW", "B008BFSMBA", "B00AATFJI4", "B00K6D1QV8", "B0077T5SWC"], "bought_together": ["B0045HCJ9E", "B00AEBB97S"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005EVY8MQ", "B002GSXKQA", "B000AL733G", "B0045HCJ9E"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 16199}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 81.5, "brand": "Masterpiece", "asin": "B000A1INJE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41PCBEW2ZSL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Alfred Hitchcock - The Masterpiece Collection"}

{"description": "Like the previous entries in theLooney Tunes Golden Collectionseries, volume 3 confirms how brilliant the Warner Bros. artists were and how durable their creations have proven. The set includes classics that every cartoon buff will recognize: \"Duck! Rabbit!

Some of the caricature films have aged less gracefully. Younger audiences will recognize the drawn versions of W.C. Fields, the Marx Brothers, Katharine Hepburn, and Charlie Chaplin. But will anyone under the age of 60 remember Edna Mae Oliver, George Arliss, or Ned Sparks?The producers have once again loaded the discs with supplemental material, including \"Point Food Rationing,\" a unseen short explaining wartime ration books; a BBC documentary on Chuck Jones; and interstitial animated sequences forThe Bugs Bunny Show. \"Philbert\" ranks as the oddest of the extras: an unsold (and leaden) pilot from 1963, featuring live actors and an animated title character. Whoopi Goldberg introduces the set, explaining that some of the ethnic gags would no longer be considered appropriate.

{"description": "The secondSpotlight Collectionfeatures both the first \"Tom and Jerry\" short and some of the last films in the series. In 1940, the cartoon unit of MGM was under pressure to produce more, so story man Bill Hanna and animator Joe Barbera were allowed to direct a cartoon. \"Puss Gets the Boot\" received an Oscar nomination, and introduced the duo that would become Tom and Jerry. (Tom was originally \"Jasper.\") The series ran for 15 years and won seven Oscars. Many of the cartoons follow the pattern set in \"Puss Gets the Boot\": Mammy Two-Shoes (Lilian Randolph) warns Tom that if he makes a mess or lets in any mice, he's out on his ear (\"O-W-T, out!\"). Jerry overhears the threat and makes trouble. The look of the characters changed more noticeably over the years than the storylines: their rounded designs didn't really suit the widescreen format, so they were drawn flatter and more angular.It's interesting to see how some of these cartoons prefigure the later work of Hanna and Barbera: the underwater antics in \"The Cat and the Mermouse\" anticipate Tom and Jerry's frolic with Esther Williams inDangerous When Wet(1953); Yakky Doodle onThe Yogi Bear Show(1961) was copied from Little Quacker.

{"description": "Goober fans, rejoice--the arrival of George Lindsay's popular character is just one of the homespun joys ofThe Andy Griffith Show's fourth season, which has been compiled on this five-disc set. Lindsay as Goober Pyle, cousin to Jim Nabors's Gomer, makes his debut in one of the season's funniest episodes, \"Fun Girls,\" which is also the only time Gomer and Goober appeared together on screen. By season's end, Gomer would depart for his own series (season 4's final episode, \"Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.,\" would serve as the pilot for that program), but before then, he enjoyed some fine episodes, including \"Andy Saves Gomer\" (from a fire at the filing station) and \"Citizen's Arrest\" (a knockout showcase for Nabors and Don Knotts, who is topnotch, as always, as Barney Fife). Other supporting characters get a spotlight or two in season 4, including Howard Morris's Ernest T. Bass (\"Hot Rod Otis, \"Otis T. Bass Joins the Army\") and Denver Pyle and Maggie Peterson's Briscoe and Charlene Darling (\"Briscoe Declares for Aunt Bee\"), but of course, the crux of the show remains Andy and son Opie (Ron Howard), who do stand-out work in the well-loved \"Opie the Birdman,\" which addresses serious topics--death and responsibility--in the series' typically warm and humane manner.

{"description": "Quiet patience and an observant eye turn a seemingly unpromising subject into a rich and fascinating movie.The Wild Parrots of Telegraph Hillcaptures the life of Mark Bittner, a gentle homeless musician who's befriended a flock of wild parrots in a neighborhood of San Francisco. Following Bittner, thecamera zooms in on individual parrots, revealing their individual personalities and the traits of their species. This leads to Bittner's own life, the network of friendships that support him, and the ways in which the parrots--a non-native species--interact with both the natural ecosystem and the city government; just about every topic opens up another until a flock of colorful birds represents a microcosm of nature and society.Filmmaker Judy Irving has created an exemplary documentary simply by paying attention to the details of the world around her subject.Everything you expect from a Hollywood blockbuster--romance, violence, humor, sorrow, strong personalities in conflict--is here in spades, except that the heroes and heroines have bright red and green feathers. Utterly rewarding.--Bret FetzerProduct Description:An \"engrossing, delightful film\" (The Washington Post),The Wild Parrots of Telegraph Hillis the bonafide sleeper theatrical hit of the year. The film's endearing guide is Mark Bittner, an aging bohemian, but the supporting cast members, a rambunctious flock of urban parrots, are the true stars, and their surprisingly humanlike behavior makes for a wondrous and rare experience. The film follows the ups-and-downs of these wild birds within the green niches of San Francisco as Bittner befriends, feeds, and names the members of the flock. Along the way, we meet many unforgettable characters: among them Connor, the grouchy yet lovable outcast of the flock, crying for a mate but luckless in his pursuits, and \"the lovers,\" Picasso and Sophie, inseparable until Sophie is forced into mourning when Picasso disappears. More than a mere birdwatcher, Bittner finds solace in his immersion with these strikingly beautiful creatures - but how will he cope when he's evicted from his sanctuary and forced to live away from the parrots? Packed with romance, comedy and a surprise ending that \"makes you feel like you could fly out of the theater\" (San Jose Mercury News),The Wild Parrots of Telegraph Hillshows just how wondrously similar the human and animal worlds really can be.Wild About Animals? See More!The Wild Parrots of Telegraph Hill(book)March of the PenguinsGrizzly ManWinged MigrationBest Documentaries of 2005Nature & Wildlife DVDsBelow, Cinephile Ned Viall interviews producer/director Judy Irving:Ned: There's a scene early on where you ask, \"Why don't you cut your hair?\" Mark says, \"I'm not going to cut my hair until I have a girlfriend.\" So I wondered, \"Will there be a scene at the end where he cuts his hair?\" Did you know what was going to happen when you recorded that scene?Judy: I recorded that close to the beginning of the project. I didn't know how things would end up. As I was editing, I knew what I was doing, though. Like in dramatic films, I wanted to have setups and payoffs throughout the movie. That was one of them. I also wanted folks almost to forget it after it happened.Ned: I was struck by the narrative quality of Parrots. It&rsquo;s almost like a fiction film. There&rsquo;s Connor, the outcast. He's like the tough guy who turns out to have a heart of gold, sticking up for the injured birds as their fellow cherry heads attack them. Then he suffers his apparent tragic demise&mdash;like the brother in Slumdog Millionaire.Judy: Connor was the classic outsider. I didn&rsquo;t make anything up. The cherry heads didn't like him because of his blue head. Discrimination happens even in the bird world.Ned: Another part of the story arc was where you create this beautiful world, and then it has to end. Mark has to leave. What's going to happen to the birds?Judy: That all happened while I was filming. Mark was living in the cottage, and the owners had to ask him to move because it was literally sliding down the hill. I knew that might happen when I started filming. I just hoped I&rsquo;d get enough shot before he had to go. So his moving became part of the story. But in a documentary you can't control those things. There's no script. That's the risk you take. You just hope events will unfold in a way that makes a good story. I much prefer storyline documentaries to standard &ldquo;talking heads and b-roll&rdquo; type documentariesNed: In the movie you&rsquo;re not antagonistic exactly, but you keep asking Mark questions like, how come you don't get a job?

{"description": "Perennially one of the WB's highest-rated series,Gilmore Girlshit its creative high point to date with its stellar fifth season, which started out with young Rory (Alexis Bledel) feeling the fallout of doing something terribly non-Rory-like: sleeping with Dean (Jared Padalecki), her married ex-boyfriend. Rory's indulgence in adultery put, for the first time, a serious, sharp wedge in her relationship with her mother, Lorelai (Lauren Graham), who was both shocked by her daughter's behavior and worried Rory would repeat the mistakes Lorelai made at her age. But while Rory jetted off to Europe with her grandmother (Kelly Bishop) for the summer, Lorelai finally got her relationship with diner owner Luke (Scott Patterson) into a serious groove, starting with an official (and incredibly sweet) first date and others that involved, if you can believe it, a SwedishPippi Longstockingmovie. And as Lorelai navigated romantic terrain in Stars Hollow (terrain that of course did not run smooth), Rory found life more complex in her second year at Yale, as her relationship with Dean became increasingly strained. Not only that, she found her attention turned towards preppy Logan (Matt Czurchy), a spoiled rich kid who represented everything Rory couldn't stand--and was of course immediately attracted to. Little did Rory know that Logan's entrance into her life, and her interaction with his family, would be the catalyst for one of the most momentous decisions she would ever make.With this season ofGilmore Girls, creative forces Amy Sherman-Palladino and Daniel Palladino finally found a way to make the Stars Hollow-Yale dichotomy work perfectly, as each location still stood alone but had decided repercussions on the other. Gone were freshman-year anxieties for Rory and in their place were more adult romantic concerns as well as a class consciousness that, for the first serious time, found Rory on the side of the haves and not the have-nots. While the Rory-Dean drama played itself out nicely and succinctly, it was the devilish Logan who lit a fire underneath this Gilmore girl; the episode \"You Jump, I Jump, Jack\" was a lovely twist on the '30s romantic comedies that found rich folk at play with words and deeds. Bledel started to fully blossom as Rory grew from ing&#xE9;nue to leading lady, and she was matched peerlessly by Graham, whose passion, anger, stubbornness, and ravishing beauty all came to a head in \"Wedding Bell Blues,\" which featured her two greatest nemeses: her mother and Rory's dad, Christopher (David Sutcliffe). The show's trademark eccentricities were all in place--including aPulp Fictionparty and an elementary school production ofFiddler on the Roof, among other things--but it mined the best drama of its run with the season's last four episodes, which found Rory's confidence shaken to the core. To give any of the proceedings away would spoil the drama, but suffice it to say you will be glued to the TV for this season's final four hours; it'sGilmore Girlsat its phenomenal best.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000G1R4SY", "B000N6TYLW", "B002BJGYTO", "B002BJGYTY", "B002BJGYU8", "B00B1LKXV8", "B0001CCXZW", "B006WZIAHM", "B009MA9ZW8", "B00006JIBS", "B003TY2SWC", "B00DCODLES", "B003QZSWRY", "B0077PTWHI", "B0018CWEXA", "B002ZG98Z0", "B00IXMF2K0", "B00GUOJJUW", "B0077PTWY6", "B000H7JCG4", "B003R4ZMJU", "B00EJ1IY4K", "B000NA1PUG", "B004HW7JI8", "B00BGQ2NDO", "B00BGI05Y6", "0345532767", "1416990682", "B00KS9V6EC", "B00BIR381W", "B004STBF2G", "B006WK4Y6I", "B005IA9JQ8", "B002ZG988M", "B00447L4KA", "B00A8KJN8M", "B002C6A6N6", "B00BB8ZIRK", "B009RX85N0", "B002ZG976U", "B005VPVW3I", "B00GQQ75QO"], "bought_together": ["B000G1R4SY", "B000N6TYLW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002BJGYTO", "B0001CCXZW", "B000G1R4SY", "B002BJGYTY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 30042}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 18.35, "brand": "", "asin": "B000BB1MIC", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51dTX8296aL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Gilmore Girls: Season 5 (Digipack)"}

{"description": "Andrew Davies isn't much of household name in the U.S., but he's the king of the BBC mini-series. His skillfully adapted scripts forPride & Prejudice(the beloved Colin Firth version) and many, many more are peerless examples of classic novels done right--cunningly edited and shaped to let all the rich emotion and sharp intelligence spill over with zip and vigor.Bleak Houseis no exception; it's one of the best Dickens adaptations to date. The mini-series form allows Dickens' panoramic view, brimming with eccentric characters and complex turns of plot, to sprawl out without losing an iota of suspense or momentum. Two innocent young  orphans (Patrick Kennedy and Carey Mulligan) are the potential heirs to a fortune, but their fates are snarled in a monumental legal battle known as Jarndyce and Jarndyce. But the heart of the story is another orphan, Esther Summerson (Anna Maxwell Martin), whose mysterious parentage proves to be intertwined with the fate of the Jarndyce wards and the aloof Lady Dedlock (Gillian Anderson,The X-Files). Dickens' story twines through an excoriating vision of the legal system to heartbreaking domestic drama to a murder investigation to near-Gothic horror, all broken into utterly delicious half-hour segments (after the hour-long opening episode). Martin is utterly beguiling, homely at one moment and luminous the next; Anderson's grippingly eerie and brittle performance will delight her fans. But to single out anyone seems absurd, because every character--from the vicious lawyer Tulkinghorn (Charles Dance,White Mischief) to the foppish parasite Skimpole (Nathaniel Parker,The Inspector Lynley Mysteries) to the simpering clerk Guppy (Burn Gorman)--is intricately drawn, all hitting a mesmerizing balance between caricature and stark emotional honesty.Bleak Housedemonstrates that humor, pathos, and social criticism can all be contained in one wonderfully entertaining package.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001PU8N0I", "B0009PVZM8", "B002XTBECY", "B0009PVZIW", "B0031RAP5O", "B000M2E32M", "B000784WNQ", "B0077PBPGO", "B000GIXLUC", "B0009PVZL4", "B000FQIRXQ", "B00005YUNK", "B000AYEL6U", "B00065GVIO", "B0012OVCE6", "B00065GX96", "B00005JOA0", "B000EBD9VC", "B0077PBPVE", "B00140PK6O", "B0000AQS3P", "B004JMSIQS", "B001PU8O5W", "0141439726", "B000Z27HLS", "B00BCXW106", "B003WEAW18", "B00003CXSA", "B00F1BFRA6", "B00009MEJ4", "B00E3UN44W", "B000E0ODZE", "B004XVMCMQ", "B000FQIRY0", "B00003JRCQ", "B004K4FUUC", "B004QOB8SO", "B0083HXKMC", "B005T0OY5S", "B004132HZS", "B00H4ZEFTQ", "B002XTBE6K", "B007A2O3FO", "B000BNTMKK", "B00E3UN66I", "B001PU8MZO", "B000V1OUPE", "B000Z27HMW", "B00062IZ0Y", "B00141188M", "B00DW5IKN4", "B000LPQ6DE", "B00HUAGZ34", "B00BOTCJXC", "B009NRQTGU", "B0031RAP5Y", "0141439963", "B00BIR2A3E", "B003TY2STA", "B00C888LOO", "B0074FUSFG", "B002EWD0I6", "B0093I913W", "B000A8AXXG", "B000089QEM", "B002XTBEDI", "B000FQIRYA", "B000M2E32C", "B0013NAMLK", "B00AATGDUC", "B00B62R9XM", "B00HGE90Z4", "B00G6HO368", "B001GJ4U5A", "B009L2EW5W", "B0080QOL10", "B00J3M54AW", "B00AF82WTO", "B00IKM5OTW", "B000NJL4QC", "B002VWOMZ4", "B003CP1T50", "B00B83OIVA", "B00JJRLFVS", "B00CDZBS7O", "B000E8JNQU", "B001VLBDB2", "B001PU8O4I", "B00DW5ILF6", "B004N66XYE", "B0009PVZK0", "B00FRQ0L2O", "B001H9JBW6", "B00CLB7CFM", "B008UQUS26", "B00GAXASK8", "B00005JKNF", "B004JMSIVI", "B004H0ZHD4", "B00D49YFAA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0031RAP5Y", "B0009PVZIW", "B001PU8N0I", "B0031RAP5O"]}, "price": 1.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 141194}, "asin": "B000CEXG0U", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515XGD7NEZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Bleak House"}

{"description": "The Leopard Man (1943, 66 min.)- Adapted from the Cornell Woolrich novel Black Alibi, The Leopard Man is a lesser but still fascinating psychological-horror effort from producer Val Lewton. Someone has been killing off the citizens of a small New Mexico town, and the most likely suspect is a huge leopard, purchased for a local nightclub act by press agent Jerry Manning (Dennis O'Keefe). Neither Manning nor his star Clo-Clo (Margo) are totally convinced that the big cat is responsible, and as it turns out they're right. The haunting finale takes place during the annual \"Dance of the Dead\" festivities, during which the genuine predator is revealed. The opening sequence of Leopard Man, atmospherically detailing the last few moments of murder victim Teresa Delgado (Margaret Landry), is so powerful that the rest of the film seems anticlimactic. Long available only in its 59-minute reissue form, the film was restored to its original 65-minute running time in the mid-1980s.\n\nThe Ghost Ship (1943, 69 min.)- RKO horror producer Val Lewton dished up seven reels of brooding psychological terror with The Ghost Ship. Richard Dix stars as the ship's captain, a tortured soul who teeters on the verge of madness. Seaman Russell Wade notices the captain's deterioration, but his warnings are dismissed by the crew. Captain Dix completely goes over the edge, sadistically playing a game of cat and mouse with the luckless Wade--and endangering the lives of everyone on board. While the viewer may notice that Ghost Ship closely resembles the Jack London tale The Sea Wolf, playwrights Samuel R. Golding and Norbert Faulkner felt that the film was too close for comfort to an unproduced play of their own. The writers sued RKO, forcing the studio to withdraw Ghost Ship from theatres and prohibiting future TV showings.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000DZBNKS", "B000A0GOF0", "B0024FADCE", "B000A0GOFA", "B000A0GOFK", "B0000UX4X0", "B000N3T0H8", "B004P9UWLY", "B00005BH23", "B00000G02H", "B00DOZNGC2", "B00407PNWO", "B0000694WH", "B00D9EJFZA", "B00HFWETZ8", "B000WNHTCC", "B00DZP1C9K", "B003N2CVRC", "B000FWHW90", "B00D9EJFV4", "B00000K3U3", "0783240961", "B001B9ZVVC", "B000W4D94S", "B000UAFDR0", "B000FWHW8Q", "B000VX9WB4", "B000EHSVJG", "B00005LC4N", "B00009PY4D", "B0009X75EC", "B001ARDBXU", "B00027JYMG", "B00005LC4L", "B00005LC4J", "B000RXVNDI", "0292716281", "B000HEVZ7G", "B002945DUW", "B00009PY45", "B000EHQTZO", "B000FFJ83U", "B001BSBBGC", "B00FJYXP36", "B0000694WM", "B0087ZG7OI", "B0009X770E", "B0007R4T26", "6305761078", "B00FERT0PK", "B000G6BLYM", "B00I9BU3M2", "B000UDGOB6", "B00005LC4O", "B00FQPLZ08", "B000FVQLKW", "B00005R1O7", "B00005AUK1", "B000068TPG", "B000EXDSBQ", "B00DE1LD6W", "B00005JKGX", "B000FKO3VM", "B0024FAG8A", "B00H7BJ0C4", "B000RXVND8", "B003ICZW7I", "B000B83846", "B009AGEY98", "B00EL6A7XE", "B000B8380A", "B00009NHC0", "B001HNDR4A", "B000AQKU72", "B00DSAUJ32", "B00000C0QO", "B000CNE088", "B00CUKTHES", "B0028DRGDQ", "B0089LT800", "B000063UR0", "B00005O5CA", "6305869367", "0783240953", "B00AY586X4", "B00AEBBA7W", "B00158K1AA", "B00508W2Z8", "B00275EHDM", "B00480OBXA", "B005D0RDKM", "B0013XZ6SY", "B000AP04M4", "B005ETANC2", "B000UDGOBG", "B005ETAL9C", "B000RXVNCY", "B000BYA5I2", "B00DZP1BVO", "B004H0M32M"], "bought_together": ["B000DZBNKS", "B000A0GOF0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000A0GOEQ", "B000A0GOF0", "B0024FADCE", "B000A0GOFK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 140735}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.57, "brand": "WB", "asin": "B000DZD9SM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZSRMG2GJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Leopard Man (1943)/The Ghost Ship"}

The result? Lots of gruesome deaths and plenty of manic action, delivered with kinetic style by first-time feature director John Gulager. Not everything aboutFeastworks--Gulager's drive is thwarted by the unfocused script, which favors smarmy dialogue over substance--but the effects are impressive, given the film's price tag, and the cast is incredibly game for the gory goings-on, with Krista Allen (Entourage), Judah Friedlander (30 Rock), Balthazar Getty (Alias), and Gulager's father, veteran actor Clu Gulager, among the stand-outs.

{"description": "The love life of a woolly mammoth--handled with G-rated delicacy--drives this sequel to the first computer-animated romp in the age of prehistoric mammals. While the firstIce Agetook a delightful premise and suffocated it with a formulaic plot--in which a mammoth named Manfred (voiced by Ray Romano,Everyone Loves Raymond), a sloth named Sid (John Leguizamo,Moulin Rouge!), and a sabre-tooth tiger named Diego (Denis Leary,Rescue Me) helped an abandoned human infant return to its tribe (basically,Three Mammals and a Baby)--the sequel takes the now-familiar setting, gives it a shapeless, episodic storyline, and yet somehow becomes pretty darn entertaining. Faced with the threat of a flood from melting ice, our heroic trio are on the run to escape from their blossoming valley. On the way, they meet a female mammoth (Queen Latifah,Bringing Down the House) who thinks she's an opossum and get menaced by some freshly defrosted carnivo!  rous fish. Add into the mix a herd of lava-worshipping mini-sloths, some Busby Berkeley-style vultures, and more ingenious slapstick featuring the acorn-crazed Scrat, andIce Age: The Meltdownwill amuse even jaded adults. --Bret FetzerBeyondIce Age: The MeltdownIce Age - Super Cool EditionIce Age & Ice Age 2: The Meltdown - (DVD 2-Pack)Funtastic Adventures Collection Box Set (Ice Age / Robots / Fern Gully / Once Upon a Rainforest)Stills fromIce Age: The Meltdown(click for larger image)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001GCUNWQ", "B005LAIISA", "B0006UEVT0", "B005QODEEE", "B000AY74OG", "B001NCDFTW", "B004HO6I4M", "B000UVKGPI", "B000MV9026", "B00005JMQZ", "B005LAIHW2", "B00CWM58WY", "B0039N74CW", "B0006JMLRK", "B00005JNQS", "B00CHVJODE", "B002WJI2QQ", "B002ZG9904", "B000L22SG6", "B00365F6I2", "B00BG0RSJ4", "B0042U94UQ", "B008JFUQ16", "B000M343BC", "B001ECQ75A", "B001DPHDCY", "B00JK531ES", "B0013FSWT2", "B001GCUO7A", "B001FTIJS0", "B001GCUNW6", "B0012EM5D8", "B00G5G7EXY", "B009PPO78W", "B00005JNS0", "B00E00OGE2", "B00E9ZATJO", "B0030IIZ4M", "B00007LVCM", "B0030IIYYS", "B000VBJEEG", "B000FQISFS", "B00ALMNCLQ", "B004EPZ034", "0783231474", "B00003CXJ4", "B002ZG97YM", "B00AFEX83C", "B00F522C7C", "B000H7JCK0", "B0046A9RMM", "B00HLTD2OE", "B0013FSL3E", "B00947N6D8", "B001U3D88M", "B001PR0YEE", "B00275EHJG", "B001HN6918", "B00GRZPQCO", "B004EPZ0AC", "B008YWY0HK", "B0090SI1RM", "B004G600A4", "B001HN6922", "B0000AOX0O", "B00LG6YEKE", "B003TJM6I8", "B0000VV4W2", "B001KVZ6FW", "B00GDT5T9Y", "B00005JN4W", "B00EV1YZ96", "B004LWZW7Y", "B00029LO0Y", "B004HO6HXY", "B001OMU6UM", "B002XODB66", "B000SJQQPQ", "B005LAIH4A", "B00AEFXMSS", "B000BITUVG", "B000RMJ4F8", "B005F96UJ6", "B005SDUV4E", "B003Y5H5AG", "B004EPZ048", "B001APZMJS", "B009PQCR74", "B003H9M1Q2", "B0000CABKY", "B000AAF1TU", "B00004R99F", "B00CTQWJEI", "B00EPH8SFI", "B0000AK7AA", "B003UESJF6", "B00EBBGLFC", "B0034G4OYA", "B005KG4EFG", "B00H7KJTMG"], "bought_together": ["B001GCUNWQ", "B005LAIISA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005LAIISA", "B001GCUNWQ", "B0006UEVT0", "B00CWM58WY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 30729}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.4, "brand": "Fox Home Entertainment", "asin": "B000GUJYZQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518KJJQ5ZNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Ice Age - The Meltdown (Full Screen Edition)"}
{"description": "Filter aTwilight Zonevibe through Stephen King's brain and you getNightmares & Dreamscapes, an uneven but generally entertaining collection of eight tales that originally (2006) aired on TNT. There is no unifying theme here; although King's short stories provided the source material, there are six directors and seven screenwriters represented, so the episodes offer a variety of looks and styles, with content ranging from monsters to mind games, from pure fantasy to pulp fiction, from genuinely scary to merely unsettling. Still, a certain ineffably \"King-ian\" sensibility, combining elements of horror, terror, suspense, and whimsy, is always in evidence, as are the popular writer's own preoccupations (with authors who may or not be stand-ins for King himself, rock 'n' roll, and guys who won't ask for directions while their wives complain, inevitably leading them into very nasty situations).Among the highlights: In \"Battleground,\" a merciless hit man (William Hurt) offs a toy manufacturer and then finds himself attacked in his own apartment by a battalion of indefatigable toy soldiers; directed by Brian Henson, the episode has no dialogue and some terrific effects work. In \"Umney's Last Case,\" William H. Macy is amusing as a crime writer who cruelly toys with his literary alter ego, an arch, fedora-wearing gumshoe (also Macy); it's an actingtour de forceand a story that takes some deft and intriguing turns. \"The Road Virus Heads North,\" with Tom Berenger as a horror novelist who finds himself pursued by&#x85; well, by a painting (guess you had to be there), is perhaps the scariest of the lot; it's also the best shot, with a cool jazz soundtrack and a nifty ending. Less successful is \"Crouch End,\" set in a sinister part of London where \"thin spots\" in the earth lead to creepy new dimensions (nice premise, but it's overwritten and fails to sustain itsTwilight Zoneweirdness), while \"You Know They Got a Hell of Band\" is only fitfully effective in its depiction of Rock & Roll Heaven, Oregon, a town where Elvis is mayor and the rest of the living dead range from Hendrix and Joplin to Duane Allman and Buddy Holly. The three-disc set's decent if unexceptional special features include \"inside looks\" at the making of several episodes, actor interviews, and more.--Sam Graham", "related": {"also_bought": ["B006J8NPAE", "B000G1R39E", "B000U1ZV6W", "B00000F3SB", "B0000C2IQQ", "B00009OWI3", "B000063US5", "1573625779", "B002EP8FDI", "B008QE9Z8A", "B000053UIF", "B00BW4S8AC", "B00005UQ9V", "B0002OXVG4", "B000RIWAV2", "B00AEBB91E", "B00BW4S87U", "B00APQLJTA", "0792841328", "B0010X73ZG", "B00006FDCD", "B0007WFXNA", "B000H4JH7Q", "6305645574", "B0001FVDQ4", "B0002O7XW2", "B000077VRT", "B000TJ6PBK", "B00AEBB91O", "B002NZK5SM", "B000RZIGUE", "B003L2M584", "0767821599", "B00005LQ0Q", "B0007NFMB2", "B000068IES", "B00BW4S89S", "B00AEFYV9W", "B000GBEWRU", "B00005O439", "B0084MVE7E", "B0007CEXUY", "630523650X", "6305120021", "B00AEFXR8I", "0790742829", "B00BTYPW7C", "1573626910", "1439102562", "B00006FDCU", "B00A1AU72A", "B003VJTGNE", "B0033HKCV4", "B0053TWVDC", "B0053TWV46", "6304936397", "0792846443", "B00KW3A6KE", "B00C2CDJ34", "B000069I05", "B0024FADBA", "B002GHHHG0", "B000WC384Q", "B00005JOJE", "B00DII0MGI", "B002AS45VK", "B00005K3NR", "B0002J4ZX2", "B0004Z31OS", "B000SULWKO", "1476770387", "B008HSK3PE", "B002VWNIDG", "6304604572", "B001KKU9CI", "B003JIPN20", "0786890436", "B000UVV22O", "B000UYX4PO", "B00IYJRIKO", "B00C7T0EPS", "B000E5N6B6", "1476754454", "B000P0J0EM", "B00AKGG828", "B000FFJZO2", "B0002A2VK0", "B0002S94BQ", "B006BZ8NSE", "B000F3UAE8", "B0077PTWLO", "B0001907BC", "B006ZL1P66", "0783116926", "B00AN10NU8", "B002BE7JEI", "B005CFBZVG", "0670813028", "B000P0J0BU"], "bought_together": ["B006J8NPAE", "B000G1R39E"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00006FDCD", "B000063US5", "B00BW4S8AC", "B00AEBB91E"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 14405}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 8.13, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B000GYI340", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41697YkAkVL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Nightmares &amp; Dreamscapes - From the Stories of Stephen King"}

Few changes can be seen in the 30 episodes compiled here, save for the color broadcast (which came to pass during the '65-'66 season) and the arrival of Sam Jones (the likable Ken Berry), another amiable widower who became the focus of the spin-off series,Mayberry R.F.D.Otherwise, it's business as usual in Mayberry, which includes a welcome return visit from Don Knotts' Barney Fife (in \"Barney Hosts a Summit Meeting,\" where he convinces Andy to let the U.S. and Soviet governments host a summit in his home), a turn in the role of deputy for Goober (George Lindsay) in \"Suppose Andy Gets Sick,\" a great deal of tomfoolery by newer characters Howard Sprague (Jack Dodson) and Emmett Clark (Paul Hartman), and guest appearances by Jack Nicholson (\"Aunt Bee the Juror\"), Allan (The Brady Bunch) Melvin (\"Howard's Main Event\") and Morgan Brittany as \"Opie's First Love.\" Fans may debate on the quality of the final season in comparison to those that preceded it (and to be fair, there are a handful of less-than-stellar episodes, most notably \"Opie's Group,\" which finds Andy's son joining a rock band), but the comfortable performances by the cast help to smooth over any rough patches. As with all previousGriffithboxed sets, no extras are featured here.-- Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000FSME10", "B000EBGE82", "B000BYRCF6", "B000B8I9ZY", "B0009UC7MK", "B0007Y08P6", "B0002NY8PI", "B003SLEDJC", "B00H8KC1N4", "B00LT1JKN2", "B001DHXT4I", "B0018E03CW", "B00007IG1K", "B001JAHQQ6", "B0041SI7B6", "B001DHXT66", "B0013LRKV2", "B00HQLZCIQ", "B00JEZWRE4", "B001992NZG", "B000O59A1G", "B001SLNPSO", "B00KBES386", "B0030BS1E8", "B0001AVZDU", "B008VNI9TC", "B00KW02JW0", "B000EGDANO", "B000E6ES9Y", "B006UKX63W", "B001BN4WHW", "B00KTZALDC", "B008VNI9EW", "B000PISZ86", "B000M343AI", "B00GWJIDB6", "B00198X0YK", "B000YKYT1M", "B001LRTT30", "B00280QNKG", "B00004TGYD", "B00G5N6C8U", "B00IS6WQ2S", "B004DCM5RC", "B00I458456", "B000G6BL7O", "B001LM64VK", "B006IRQUIA", "B000VDDE1I", "B000002T6S", "B00FM4S8IU", "B00000HY5X", "B000HWZ4J8", "B001D2WUCA", "B00I86MQF0", "B005SQRYQY", "B0063FGERO", "B008VNIBTK", "B00K3KI4T6", "B003IRUFB6", "B00I87U8UE", "B000UX6TKM", "B001E6JC26", "B0007WFY4S", "B000A9QKSM", "B00IP965IO", "B0007TKNHO", "B008L3650M", "B0012EM5EW", "B00JAD6BYW", "B003IB0FTE", "B004MLEYV4", "B000E3L7FK", "B0000B1A5A", "B00GHH9HW2", "B0077T5SBS", "B00GLT2SOA", "B000HIVIOM", "B002OOWKVM", "B000BYA4JW", "B000005KXI", "B001992NXI", "B00I87U9H6", "B000ASDFIQ", "B00F6D62O4", "B0014FAIYS", "B000FSME1K", "B0012Q3SZ0", "B000EU1Q3Q", "B00008R9MC", "B000E6ESBW", "B00HMOWA0A", "B002JIOOAS", "B00IF0KAYS", "B00DXLO086", "B0038SUBDC", "B0009B16TO", "B001JAHSAK", "B00HNGC56G", "B005BUA1F8"], "bought_together": ["B000FSME10", "B000EBGE82"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000BYRCF6", "B0007Y08P6", "B000EBGE82", "B000FSME10"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 22678}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 15.04, "brand": "Paramount Home Video", "asin": "B000HWZ4IY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51G8XC200QL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Andy Griffith Show - The Complete Final Season"}
{"description": "Thai-born martial artist Tony Jaa, whose gravity-defying stunts wowed American audiences inOng-Bak: The Thai Warrior, returns in an equally eye-popping stunt fest that should thrill all but the most jaded action fans. The very simple plot has the soft-spoken, mild-mannered Jaa as a young man from a rural community dispatched to Australia to recover a pair of sacred elephants. Once there, he discovered that a female crime boss (played by transgendered actor Jing Xing) is behind the missing pachyderms, and Jaa pulls out all the stops to recover the animals for his village. As inOng-Bak, the appeal ofThe Protectoris watching Jaa unleash his muay thai skills on a host of villainous types, and he gets several astonishing showcases in this film, most notably a nearly-unbroken take in which he dispatches some 50 goons as he makes his way up a four-story structure. Those looking for the depth of story or character found in the best of Hong Kong action cinema won't find it inThe Protector, but the rewards for action fans are plentiful and thoroughly entertaining. The two-disc Collector's Edition ofThe Protectorincludes a wealth of extras, most notably the original Thai version of the film (titledTom Yum Goong), which runs approximately 30 minutes longer than the American version. Commentary by martial arts writer and fan Bey Logan is featured on the American edit, along with a deleted scene, a featurette about Jaa with Logan and rapper/producer The RZA (who scored the American version and, for some reason, is described as a major force in bringing Asian entertainment to the States), making-of featurettes on both the English and Thai versions of the film (the latter features a subtitled Thai-language commentary track with Jaa, director Prachya Pinkaew, and stunt coordinator/mentor Panna Rittikrai), and three fair short films that were produced for a promotional tie-in contest.-- Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0009VBTQY", "B002XTXGA2", "B004BZ5ADW", "B00JVQ7RCS", "B002DHACS8", "B005ZMBEXU", "B001L67A4G", "B003INBNXO", "B004326EV0", "B0085A9J18", "B004I1AGTC", "B000GFLKDU", "B003FXXNH6", "B003EVAG4C", "B000K7UC2Y", "B004U7MR0K", "B000ICLU7C", "B004H2CXBQ", "B004P8R9O8", "B00ATXIJOC", "B000K2UW06", "B003LN0NXC", "B001MEJY9G", "B0035V35P8", "B0016MJ6JC", "B000N4SHNK", "B005F96UGO", "B00HSJ2EMI", "B00GXFZOYI", "B004XQO8MS", "B004SIP88Y", "B002C6VMIY", "B00J5LXST0", "B003DVB7F0", "B000A2IPQY", "B00B6OEE7O", "B006C1S1DY", "B002FU8JTW", "B0018PH3NS", "B00284G2BC", "B004U7MR1O", "B000MM0LEG", "B000V6I7N0", "B005E7SEZW", "B004GJYRKA", "B00FLCYIAA", "B001EI5C5U", "B009VL2A5M", "B001U0HB5Q", "B0054EKDEU", "B000HC2M3Y", "B00AWHDEIQ", "B0030A6ICG", "B00ET2ODYY", "B001MEJY9Q", "B00JVQ7PS4", "B000UVV2AG", "B004VW4V9E", "B00005YUNV", "B00ENTX7JU", "B00008EY6M", "B00J5LXTUI", "B0056OZI0M", "B005F96UHI", "B004SIPAP0", "B0085A9HXS", "B00C3ALL9O", "B006JD48GY", "B0019F02U8", "B00369ERCY", "B000K2V7DW", "B000EE3FUY", "B005KK2FWG", "B004TFTE9A", "B00003CXR4", "B00G3HOJZ6", "B002XTBE5Q", "B0009S2T0M", "B003YOZNFQ", "B003M9ZABU", "B000FKO5QK", "B0010X740K", "B00EI3Y1QO", "B0051SFTGQ", "B001QB9H1U", "B00FEHCQEC", "B00005OOQ1", "B000MM0LE6", "B000P6R9N0", "B008XEZXES", "B001BEK8HO", "B00003CY5A", "B000QGEB12", "0767819640", "B00HI9QGWC", "B0013D8LCM", "B0010X741O", "B0019PL2W0"], "bought_together": ["B002XTXGA2", "B0009VBTQY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0085A9J18", "B00J5LXST0", "3918810143", "B004I1AGTC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 15313}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.1, "brand": "Weinstein Company", "asin": "B000I0RNWU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51YIZWM7HuL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Protector (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)"}

{"description": "First screened in Europe and scheduled for limited release in the U.S.,The Illusionistoffers welcome proof that \"arthouse\" quality needn't be limited to the arthouses. Set in turn-of-the-century Vienna, this stately, elegant period film benefited from a crossover release in mainstream cinemas, and showed considerable box-office staying power--granted, teenage mallrats and lusty males may have been drawn to the allure ofSeventh Heavenalumna Jessica Biel, who rises to the occasion with a fine performance. But there's equal appeal in the casting of Edward Norton and Paul Giamatti, who bring their formidable talents to bear on the intriguing tale of a celebrated magician named Eisenheim (Norton) whose stage performance offends the Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell), a vindictive lout who aims to marry Duchess Sophie (Biel), Eisenheim's childhood friend and now, 15 years later, his would-be lover. This romantic rivalry and Eisenheim's increasingly enigmatic craft of illusion are investigated by Chief Inspector Uhl (Giamatti), who's under Leopold's command and is therefore not to be trusted as Eisenheim and Sophie draw closer to their inevitable reunion. Cleverly adapted by director Neil Burger from Steven Millhauser's short story \"Eisenheim the Illusionist,\" and boasting exquisite production values and a fine score by Philip Glass,The Illusionistis the kind of class act that fully deserved its unusually wide and appreciative audience. --Jeff ShannonBeyondThe Illusionist\"Eisenheim the Illusionist\" and Other StoriesPaul Giamatti in a More Loveable RoleMagic Kits & AccessoriesStills fromThe Illusionist", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000LC55F2", "B000NOIX48", "B002ZG980U", "B002WNU0QW", "B00DWZHTOU", "B001MZ5W3M", "B00011CZRE", "B000H0MKI8", "B00008K7AO", "B000L212HC", "B00AEBB8NI", "B000GFLKF8", "B000O76ZO4", "B00003CXZ4", "B00005JLSB", "B000FKO5QK", "B000M341QE", "B00AEFXGIY", "B00005V9HH", "B00AEBB8LA", "B00005JMOW", "B00096S49Y", "0767847415", "6305313687", "B004SIP9Z6", "B0047T74CM", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B000R4SMCW", "B0002YLCG0", "B000P0J0EW", "B000HEWEE4", "B0041KKYHE", "B00BBI7EZY", "B00AEBBA2W", "B000CQLZ0Q", "0783235070", "0767802519", "B002ZG997C", "B00003CXHG", "B004SIP7ZS", "B000069HZP", "B004SIP7PS", "B003ASLJQI", "B00177Y9ZC", "B00005JLKN", "B003ZW9H68", "B001N44BVQ", "B002O3Z50Q", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00005JN2Z", "B00AEBB86A", "B00000F4ZY", "B000MZHW40", "0671686402", "B00BB67UNW", "B005HP2J0M", "B000QXDED6", "B000NIVJF4", "B001F12J0C", "B000N6TX1I", "B000LAZE8C", "B00080ZG10", "B005LAIGRS", "B0009MDPYM", "0792159659", "B000OYC7BW", "B001UV4XGU", "B004AOECXI", "0767818105", "B000XR9L50", "B0018O4YT0", "B00015YVDG", "B004SIP8JI", "B00004XPPG", "B00006ZXSK", "B001DHXT20", "B0000AC8LR", "B009B8YMB0", "0783229402", "B0006210ZG", "B001PPGAIA", "B00004BZIY", "B008JFURII", "B00005JPAR", "B00006ADFM", "B004SIP7TE", "B000F5GNX8", "B000FS9FCG", "B006P0FIGU", "B00005JMCN", "B002VWNID6", "B004XQO90O", "B004EPZ084", "B00AEBB9M8", "B000P5FH3K", "B00005JNY3", "B000063US3", "B003L20IG0"], "bought_together": ["B000LC55F2", "B002ZG980U"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000LC55F2", "B005LAIHXQ", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00DV2MVWO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 60145}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.0, "brand": "Twentieth Century Fox", "asin": "B000K7VHPU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51nYghoS63L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Illusionist (Full Screen Edition)"}
{"description": "Growing up can be a confusing journey fraught with difficult choices.  Boog (Martin Lawrence) is a domesticated Grizzly Bear who leads a perfectly happy life inside of Park Ranger Beth's (Debra Messing) garage, but a chance meeting with an overly energetic mule deer named Elliot (Ashton Kutcher) quickly changes everything and lands Boog high in the forest a few days before the opening of hunting season.  Devoid of even the most basic survival skills, Boog and Elliot stumble through the woods and find themselves at the mercy of every forest animal from skunks to chipmunks as well as an evil hunter named Shaw (Gary Sinise).  After unintentionally inciting and endangering an entire forest full of clever animals, Boog and Elliot come to the realization that only by banding together do the forest animals stand a chance of outsmarting the hunters and ensuring their own survival.This first animated film from Sony Pictures Animation takes its inspiration from cartoonist Steve Moore(In the Bleachers)and features animals with human-like intelligence, a vibrant color palate, and skilled animation that makes everything from the wind blowing Boo's fur to the animals' wild trip down the falls simply breathtaking.  While it doesn't quite live up toOver the Hedge,Open Seasonis an entertaining production that explores the difficult process of maturation, the universal need for acceptance, and the true value of friendship.  Special features include a 15-minute featurette about the animation process at Sony Pictures Animation and Image Works, a 7-minute look at the recording sessions featuring the voices behind the characters, two deleted scenes, three short animated cartoon strips, a short \"Boog and Elliot's Midnight Bun Run\" that's an extension of the trailer scene in the movie, art gallery, beat boards, humorous commentary from the animals' point of views, and a full length commentary by Producer Michelle Murdocca, Directors Roger Allers and Jill Culton, and others.  Activities include a \"Voice-A-Rama\" where viewers can hear specific lines spoken by alternate voices and a trivia \"Wheel of Fortune--Forest Edition\" as well as a DVD-ROM link to more online fun.

{"description": "Much was written about Will Ferrell's first \"dramatic role\" as Harold Crick, an IRS auditor who begins hearing a voice narrating his life. ButStranger Than Fictionis hardly a drama. However, what Ferrell does--like Jim Carrey before him inThe Truman Show--is handle a toned-down character with genuineness and affection: you believe he is this guy. Crick leads a lonely life filled with numbers and routines. While at first he considers the voice a nuisance, Crick decides more action is needed when it speaks of \"his demise.\" Enter Professor Jules Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman), who takes on the absurd notion with revelry, trying to find out what kind of book Crick's life is leading. It turns out that the voice Crick is hearing belongs to Kay Eiffel (Emma Thompson), a very real--and troubled--author who is writing a book in which Crick is a fictional character. As usual with these things, the stuffed shirt learns to live a better life--Crick even falls for one of his audits, a brash baker named Ana (Maggie Gyllenhaal). Marc Foster (Monster's Ball, Finding Neverland) has the right tone for the film, using great urban scenes (the unnamed city is Chicago) with interesting visualizations of Crick's world of numbers. He also directs Ferrell, Hoffman, and Gyllenhaal to their most charming performances (plus Linda Hunt and Tom Hulce pop up in two funny scenes). Ferrell succeeds in being a romantic lead you can root for; a scene where he eats Ana's freshly baked cookies is totally delightful without a hint of sarcasm. Screenwriter Zach Helm has two personal traits with his story: like Crick he followed his heart (he stopped rewriting scripts and only worked on his own) and like Eiffel, the final results are not a masterpiece, but good, and entertaining enough.

{"description": "Brilliantly conceived, superbly directed, and beautifully acted,Babelis inarguably one of the best films of 2006. Director Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu and his co-writer, Guillermo Arriaga (the two also collaborated onAmores Perrosand21 Grams) weave together the disparate strands of their story into a finely hewn fabric by focusing on what appear to be several equally incongruent characters: an American (Brad Pitt) touring Morocco with his wife (Cate Blanchett) become the focus of an international incident also involving a hardscrabble Moroccan farmer (Mustapha Rachidi) struggling to keep his two young sons in line and his family together. A San Diego nanny (Adriana Barraza), her employers absent, makes the disastrous decision to take their kids with her to a wedding in Mexico. And a deaf-mute Japanese teen (the extraordinary Rinko Kikuchi) deals with a relationship with her father (Koji Yakusho) and the world in general that's been upended by the death of her mother. It is perhaps not surprising, or particularly original, that a gun is the device that ties these people together. YetBabelisn't merely about violence and its tragic consequences. It's about communication, and especially the lack of it--both intercultural, raising issues like terrorism and immigration, and intracultural, as basic as husbands talking to their wives and parents understanding their children. I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu's command of his medium, sound and visual alike, is extraordinary; the camera work is by turns kinetic and restrained, the music always well matched to the scenes, the editing deft but not confusing, and the film (which clocks in at a lengthy 143 minutes) is filled with indelible moments. Many of those moments are also pretty stark and grim, and no will claim that all of this leads to a \"happy\" ending, but there is a sense of reconciliation, perhaps even resolution. \"If You Want to be Understood... Listen,\" goes the tagline. And if you want a movie that will leave you thinking,Babelis it.--Sam GrahamBeyondBabelOther Interweaving Storylines on DVDOther DVDs by Director Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rrituWhy We Love Cate BlanchettStills fromBabel(click for larger image)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0001CNRRU", "B00005N8A9", "B0041KKYF6", "B000A3XY5A", "B000F7CMRM", "B000067IZ3", "B00005JL57", "B00AEFXESQ", "B001P9KR8U", "B000N6TX1I", "B001JIE7JC", "B00005JPKE", "B00AEFXQ9S", "B00005JMJ4", "B0010DR4BO", "B000NIVJF4", "B000NIVJFY", "B000F1IQN2", "B00HF98SPS", "B0045ZAQRS", "B00011CZRE", "B000N3T0DW", "B002O3Z4Z2", "B000MZHW40", "B004SIP6VI", "B0034G4P30", "B008JFUNKU", "B003ASLJQS", "B000E1NXJ0", "B004SIP6GI", "B00AEBB89W", "B00275EGWY", "B000IONJM4", "B00H9KKGTO", "B00003CWTI", "B00080Z53O", "B00005JNCZ", "B00114XTHA", "B00GUO2SKA", "B00112S8RS", "B001PPLJIQ", "B000MXPE7O", "B00102F5WK", "B00121QGPY", "B0016Q2D66", "B002J1RZHE", "B008220DGE", "B000O76ZQC", "B0013XZ6X4", "B00080ZG10", "B00337KM2S", "B000286RP2", "B004SIP8ZM", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00005JMJG", "B00005Q4CS", "B00AEBB9CS", "B00G4Q3KOC", "B0036TGSJE", "B001TOD92C", "B000OY8NBK", "B004XVMCKS", "B00GMV8M2Y", "B00005JLRE", "B00005JH9M", "B00004WG2F", "B00AEBB8SS", "B00005JKJA", "B00H9HZITU", "B000YENUI6", "B0041KKYDI", "B001MZ5W3M", "B000N3SU92", "B000EQHXNW", "B0041KKYEM", "B001LLH8SE", "B0007TKOAA", "B000P0J0BK", "B002S5N052", "B004SIP7S0", "B00AEBB8NI", "B002SJIO4A", "B000CQLZ0Q", "B000E33VWW", "B000M341QE", "B002VWNICC", "B001NFNFNU", "6305313687", "B00005JKTF", "B00FZ4KR4U", "B00008K7AO", "B00DL48BM6", "079073639X", "B00H83EUQW", "B000FVQLRA", "B0002TT0MI", "B00AHTYI5M", "B00H9L26AA", "B00003CWRX", "B002FHGESI"], "bought_together": ["B00005N8A9", "B0041KKYF6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000A3XY5A", "B0001CNRRU", "B0041KKYF6", "B00G4Q3KOC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 100262}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.22, "brand": "Paramount Home Video", "asin": "B000MCH5P4", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51poif023LL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Babel"}
{"description": "Long beforeTwin Peaks, Mary Hartman, Mary Hartmanturned the soap opera inside out. Produced by Norman Lear (All in the Family), the syndicated serial centers around gingham-clad housewife Mary Hartman (Woody Allen regular Louise Lasser). The saga begins with Mary agonizing over her floor's waxy yellow buildup when neighbor Loretta Haggers (Emmy winner Mary Kay Place) bursts in to announce that a mass murderer is on the loose in Fernwood. That isn't Mary's only problem. The magic has gone out of her marriage to Tom (Greg Mullavey) and her grandfather is revealed as the Fernwood Flasher. And that's just the pilot.At first glance,Mary Hartman, Mary Hartmanresembles a daytime soap with consecutive airings (five nights a week), frame-filling close-ups, and syrupy score, but everything is off-kilter. When Mary isn't looking at other characters as if they're speaking in tongues, she appears to be on the verge of laughter or tears--maybe both at once. She's the ultimate desperate housewife. Aside from Grandpa Larkin (Victor Kilian), regulars include Mary&#x92;s preteen daughter Heather (Claudia Lamb), younger sister Cathy (Debralee Scott), and parents, Martha (Dody Goodman) and George Shumway (Philip Bruns). In addition, there's Sgt. Foley (Bruce Solomon), who has the hots for our sexually unsatisfied heroine, and Loretta's hubbie, Charlie (Graham Jarvis), who works with Tom and George at the plant. Mrs. Haggers, an aspiring country singer, loves her Baby Boy \"more than a hundred billion frozen Milky Ways.\" The first set of this groundbreaking series features 25 episodes. Between 1976-1978, a whopping 325 were produced, some asForever Fernwoodwhen Lasser left in 1977, reportedly due to exhaustion.
