{"description": "Woody Allen's feature-film debut,Take the Money and Run, a mockumentary that combines sight gags, sketchlike scenes, and standup jokes at rat-a-tat speed, looks positively primitive compared to his mature work. Primitive, but awfully funny. Allen plays Virgil Starkwell, a music-loving nebbish who turns to a life of crime at an early age and, undaunted by his utter and complete failure to pull off a single successful robbery, continues his unbroken spree of bungled heists and prison breaks even after he marries and raises a family. Narrator Jackson Beck, whose stentorian voice of authority makes a perfect foil for Starkwell's absurd exploits, lobs one droll quip after another with deadpan seriousness. Though spotty, Allen tosses so many jokes into the mix that it hardly matters and when they hit they are often hilarious: the chain gang posing as cousins to their old-woman hostage (\"We're very close,\" Virgil explains to a dim cop), arguing with a dotty movie director who is supposed to be their cover for a bank robbery, Virgil's escape attempt with a bar of soap. Allen spoofs decades of crime films, everything fromI Am a Fugitive from a Chain GangtoBonnie and Clyde, but you don't have to know the movies to enjoy this goofy, sometimes clumsy, but quite clever comedy.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000068DV", "6303011411", "0792846117", "6300216365", "B00003CXGR", "6304785801"], "also_viewed": ["6302697042"]}, "price": 19.9, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 382476}, "asin": "0764003828", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51TBXJ3E20L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Take the Money and Run [VHS]"}

But once on the reservation, Levoi encounters the irreverent local sheriff (Greene), and the tribe's religious leader (Chief Ted Thin Elk), who knows secrets about Levoi's own lost heritage.

{"description": "The Wild One(1953) was directed by Laslo Benedek and based on Frank Rooney's chilling short story \"Cyclists' Raid\" about a motorcycle gang taking over a small town. Props to Marlon Brando, by then an annual Oscar nominee, for agreeing to re-team with producer Stanley Kramer (who had produced the actor's debut film,The Men) on what is essentially a 79-minute B movie. His reward was to become the premier icon of 1950s rebellion, pioneering the way James Dean, Elvis Presley, and others would follow.The Wild Onealso introduced biker hipster patter to movie audiences and defined biker fashion for decades to come. So the movie is a cultural milestone--but hardly a cinematic one: it rarely escapes feeling schematic and overcautious in its fear of alienating the public on one hand and glorifying violence on the other. Lee Marvin injects a welcome shot of battery acid as the leader of a rival biker gang, and veteran cinematographer Hal Mohr does yeoman work on dull sets.--Richard T.

{"description": "It's just your typical boy-dumps-girl, boy-has-change-of-heart, boy-alienates-girl-anew love story. This romantic comedy, the last word on obsessive, can't-live-with-'em, can't-live-without-'em relationships, holds a special place in the hearts of Albert Brooks fans. Brooks stars as film editor Robert Cole, who breaks up--again, apparently--with Mary (Kathryn Harrold). They are in a no-win  situation, he tells her, like Vietnam. The sequence that follows is an  excruciating, intimately observed tour de force: Robert's long night's  journey into day. Miserable, spaced out on Quaaludes, he stumbles around his  apartment, admiring his record collection (\"I love my albums\"), rifling  through his Rolodex, making a blind date call he will instantly regret. He becomes determined to win Mary back, but again falls prey to his possessiveness and paranoia, as when he happens to find Mary's  phone bill and becomes obsessed over a long-distance number.Modern Romanceis characteristically deadpan in its depiction of one man behaving badly. The dialogue is  vintage Brooks, as when he tells a colleague (Bruno Kirby) that he and Mary  always enjoyed great sex but could never really talk. \"Do you need to talk?\"  his friend asks, which would be the topper in anyone else's comedy. But Brooks  dismisses this cheap joke with, \"We're men. Can we have a bond?\" A hilarious subplot concerns Robert's work on a cheesy science fiction film that stars George Kennedy. James L. Brooks (no relation), who would direct  Brooks to an Oscar nomination inBroadcast News, is hysterical as the deluded director who resists Robert's best, painstaking efforts to improve the film.For some,Modern Romanceis a comedy, for others, a horror film (Robert is as relentless as Michael Myers and as much a nightmare as Freddy).

{"description": "Call it \"Desperate Movie,\" because this ludicrous thriller deteriorates into unintentional comedy. For reasons that are never explained, a sociopathic killer (Michael Keaton) is the only available bone marrow donor for the cancer-stricken son of a San Francisco cop (Andy Garcia), who must capture the killer alive after a laughable escape in a labyrinthine hospital. The ensuing manhunt relies on plentiful plot holes and ridiculous shortcuts (like Keaton's use of a surgical laser to cut leg irons, or accessing hospital schematics from a prison computer). Self-consciously shot in film noir style, the cat-and-mouse routine leads to a briefly impressive car chase, but the premise (which even the movie's original press notes described as \"intriguing, if unlikely\") is based on \"moral ambiguity\" that doesn't translate from script to screen. Instead of forcing Keaton's typically \"sick genius\" to prove his ingenuity, the film pits him against a squad of cops who couldn't find a beer in a crowded pub.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00002E23C", "6305310335", "B00AEFYD9K", "B00008977C", "B00005JNNT", "B00000F5MN", "B000U1ZV76", "0767806808", "B00000IQC9", "B00008NFR3", "0767807588", "B00AEFXKZ8", "6305692572", "B0001932ZK", "B00009AOAZ", "0767810872", "0792844866", "B00007AJE1", "0783226888", "0783219571", "6305213305", "B00096S49Y", "B00029RT9E", "B000F6ZIII", "B00015YVDG", "B00008L3S6", "B000LBL3TK", "B002NZK5RI", "B003L20IG0", "B002KGVB7S", "B000N4RASS", "B004GJYRK0", "B00AEFXIIW", "B00005Y1UV", "B000C3L2PC", "B002AT8K9W", "B001KRVLCI", "B00005UQ9T", "0790736411", "0792833848", "B00JL6L4UY", "B000PISZ7W", "6305162026", "B00005QAOZ", "B0006D3HGA", "B000EU1ONS", "B000087F7R", "B002AT8KAG", "B007WZPQO6", "0783222149", "B00HLTD3ZW", "B000R4SMCW", "B00JDCP0QA", "6305308837", "B003AWRMA6", "B000NTMA0Q", "0790732149", "B003ASLJIQ", "B00004STDN", "B002LK3DZQ", "B000MEYKEG", "0767809726", "B0036TGT8Y", "B000B8GT92", "6304806434", "B00AEBB9NM", "B0045HCJFS", "6304602944", "B00005R5GA", "B004BSWC8A", "B002O3Z4WK", "B0000399WA", "B001R3YRG2", "B00003CXKA", "B00AEFYF2K", "0792844874", "B002ZG98SW", "B004SIP9CO", "B0001FGBWK", "630523650X", "B0045O2PHS", "B000P0J06K", "B001M9ELQC", "B00BGI07GC", "B000I2J736", "B001CW8016", "B00HLTD49C", "B003AWRM9M", "B000CBCWRG", "B000EQ5SRK", "6304765258", "B00008977A", "B001U0HB5Q", "B00FZ4KR4U", "B000F6ZIIS", "0783229402", "B00AEBB8O2", "B00CX7TOOG", "B000055Y0Y"], "bought_together": ["B00002E23C"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0783219571", "B000PISZ7W", "B00AEFYD9K", "B0001932ZK"]}, "price": 19.98, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 134257}, "asin": "0767812743", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/519STKWW5QL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Desperate Measures"}
{"description": "An obvious attempt to cash in on the success ofJaws, this 1977 thriller was also based on a bestseller by Peter Benchley, and it features a memorable performance by Robert Shaw (the doomed shark hunter inJaws) in one of the last roles of his career. Looking very tanned and healthy, Nick Nolte and Jacqueline Bisset play a young couple enjoying a tropical vacation who discover a glass ampoule while scuba diving off the coast of Bermuda. It takes a seasoned treasure hunter (Shaw) to identify the ampoule as part of a valuable shipment of World War II morphine lost at sea, coincidentally, atop the even greater treasure of a sunken Spanish galleon. Thus begins a race for drugs and treasure pitting Nolte, Bisset, and Shaw against a ruthless drug lord (Louis Gossett Jr.) who'll do anything--even resort to Haitian voodoo--to get what he wants. It's all rather contrived and exploitative (after all, the movie's best known for Bisset's wet T-shirt scuba-dive), but as escapist entertainment goes it's got some exciting highlights including a moray eel that attacks on cue and... well, uh, Jacqueline Bisset in a wet T-shirt.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004YMATCY", "B007STBUHI", "B00008G8LY", "B0012KJ0DK", "B00005NKSZ", "0792844017", "B00005A8XX", "B00979KQD6", "B00008WFU4", "0783230516", "B0062KMDGG", "B00AEFYSR2", "0553140531", "B00407PNY2", "B0030VANHQ", "B00153ZR8G", "B00018D3ZA", "B00005LQ0I", "B00AEFYEU8", "B000KGGIVY", "B00BGQ2P9G", "B000M53GNG", "B0045HCJKS", "B000P0J0BU", "B000E5N684", "B00J2G4ZAY", "B00005JKU0", "B003ASLJRC", "B0001FGC1U", "B001RP974M", "B00005N5S3", "B00008WFU5", "B000EHSVNW", "B00005QCVP", "B000M69SJG", "B005ETALYW", "0767802497", "0790731932", "B00AEFYBA6", "B00LC4PCVU", "079073639X", "B000NQRR1G", "0767802470", "B0045HCJ8A", "B003ASLJPE", "B000MGTQ7U", "B006XMK11W", "6305213283", "B0008ENHTY", "0792838408", "B00008K76U", "B00CPTUOI2", "B0079ZWUCA", "B0007O38ZS", "B0013LL2Z2"], "bought_together": ["B007STBUHI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00004TDTO", "B00005A8XX", "B00153ZR8G", "B000BYRCGU"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 80595}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.75, "brand": "BISSET,JACQUELINE", "asin": "0767818067", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51D-CGOvhTL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Deep"}
{"description": "Computer scientist Hannon Fuller (Armin Mueller-Stahl) finds something extremely important. Knowing that he's marked for assassination, he leaves a message in the virtual reality world he's designed, hoping it will be found by colleague Douglas Hall (Craig Bierko). Hall is a suspect in Fuller's murder and indeed finds a bloody shirt in his house, with no recollection of what he did the night before. Hall plunges headlong into Fuller's world (a re-creation of 1937 Los Angeles) to try to unravel the slaying and is soon knee-deep in confusion and trouble. What this film lacks in character depth and plot cohesiveness it makes up for in special effects and high concept. Fans of films like Blade Runner, Dark City, eXistenZ, and even the game Sim City should find this appealing. Of course, there's the question of letting the computers do all the heavy lifting in films while the humans walk through the plot (an all-too-familiar scenario in 1999), but the re-creation of '30s Los Angeles is certainly something to see, pallid script and acting or not. The Thirteenth Floor is a stylish modern-day noir that raises questions about technology versus reality, all the while wrapped up in a murder-mystery story line.", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 478777}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.8, "brand": "", "asin": "0767819446", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DKW1YJM1L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Thirteenth Floor [VHS]"}

{"description": "Of the nine films Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers completed for RKO Pictures,Follow the Fleetfalls short of the top echelon. Coming between series peaksTop HatandSwing Time,Fleetrepeats the mistake (&agrave; laFlying Down to RioandRoberta) of casting Fred and Ginger as the comic couple, while the romantic roles went to Randolph Scott and Harriet Hilliard (before she went on to fame with her husband, Ozzie Nelson, inOzzie and Harriet). Fred puts down his top hat to become sailor Bake Baker (yet another of his alliterative screen names), while Ginger plays old flame Sherry Martin. The two are reunited when Fred takes shore leave in San Francisco, and soon their efforts turn to helping Ginger's sister Connie (Hilliard) land Fred's shipmate Bilge (Scott). (Look for Lucille Ball and Betty Grable in small roles.) Too much screen time is spent on Hilliard and Scott, but Fred and Ginger make up for it with plenty of laughs and some classic musical numbers, and Irving Berlin's score is one of the best of the series, with cunning lyrics and melodies that linger in the memory. Highlights include Fred and Ginger in a dance contest, a Ginger solo tap number, and \"I'm Putting All My Eggs in One Basket,\" their best comic dance.  The pi&egrave;ce de r&eacute;sistance is \"Let's Face the Music and Dance,\" a show within a show in which Fred and Ginger don their customary evening formals. Effortlessly flowing from pantomime to song to dance, this sublime piece of storytelling is one of Fred and Ginger's defining moments.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000EQ3R6Y", "6301327853", "0790749475", "0780630157", "078062579X", "6301415132", "0780625765", "B000CQD1ZS", "6301980492", "B00008AOWJ"], "bought_together": ["B000EQ3R6Y", "6301327853"], "also_viewed": ["B000EQ3R6Y"]}, "price": 11.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 455080}, "asin": "0780625773", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/412TPQMDVQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Follow the Fleet [VHS]"}
{"description": "Fantastical writer Gary Ross (Big,Dave) makes an  auspicious directorial debut with this inspired and oddly touching comedy about two '90s kids (Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon) thrust into the black-and-white TV world ofPleasantville, aLeave It to Beaver-style sitcom complete with picket fences, corner malt shop, and warm chocolate chip cookies. When a somewhat unusual remote control (provided by repairman Don Knotts) transports them from the jaded real world to G-rated TV land, Maguire and Witherspoon are forced to play along as Bud and Mary Sue, the obedient children of George and Betty Parker (William&nbsp;H. Macy and Joan Allen). Maguire, an obsessivePleasantvilledevotee, understands the need for not toppling the natural balance of things; Witherspoon, on the other hand, starts shaking the town up, most notably when she takes basketball stud Skip (Paul Walker) up to Lover's Lane for some modern-day fun and games. Soon enough, Pleasantville's teens are discovering sex along with--gasp!--rock & roll, free thinking, and soul-changing Technicolor. Filled with delightful and shrewd details about sitcom life (no toilets, no double beds, only two streets in the town),Pleasantvilleis a joy to watch, not only for its comedy but for the groundbreaking visual effects and astonishing production design as the town gradually transforms from crisp black and white to glorious color. Ross does tip his hand a bit about halfway through the film, obscuring the movie's basic message of the unpredictability of life with overloaded and obvious symbolism, as the black-and-white denizens of the town gang up on the \"coloreds\" and impose rules of conduct to keep their strait-laced town laced up. Still, the characterizations from the phenomenal cast--especially repressed housewife Allen and soda-shop owner Jeff Daniels, doing some of their best work ever--will keep you emotionally invested in the film's outcome, and waiting to see Pleasantville in all its final Technicolor glory.--Mark Englehart", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 436957}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.82, "brand": "", "asin": "0780627024", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51C118QWETL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Pleasantville [VHS]"}
{"description": "The mind-bending worlds of author H.P. Lovecraft have long interested horror directors, but the films have rarely successfully captured his nightmarish mix of madness and mythology. John Carpenter'sIn the Mouth of Madnessis not directly based on Lovecraft's work, but screenwriter Michael De Luca draws his inspiration from Lovecraft's Cthulu mythology and then adds his own ingenious twists. John Trent (Sam Neill), an insurance investigator recently fitted for a straightjacket, tells his story to a psychiatrist. Hired to track down the missing pop-horror phenomena Sutter Cane, a Stephen King-like author whose fans are literally made for his books, Trent finds the supposedly fictional Hobb's End.  He watches the town collapse into madness, murder, and monstrous transformations: the fantastic horrors of Cane's novels played out in front of his eyes. \"Reality isn't what it used to be,\" deadpans one zombielike townsperson. In fact, it is how Cane writes it--but is he Devil, dark oracle, or simply a preacher in the service of an evil that grows stronger with every soul his books convert? The script never quite gets a grip on the blurry relationship between fact and fiction, but those details fade in the face of Carpenter's demented imagery, shiver-inducing twists, and dark wit. It's more eerie mind game than straight-out horror, a portrait of a world gone mad, and Carpenter relishes every hallucinatory moment.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000AOX0A", "0792839706", "B000RPCK2O", "B000067J0M", "B0085X315U", "B003V6XDP4", "B00AEFXW8I", "B000AM6OQ2", "B00005K3OC", "B0002CHK1S", "B000BQTC98", "B00B8O4WQA", "B0024FADBA", "B005OT810I", "B008CYDD7I", "B003TRMLQM", "B0000AOX0F", "B00008974J", "B00006AUIG", "0783116926", "B00KH57THK", "B0000DC12T", "B0009298N4", "B000MV8ABS", "B006LMRMMA", "B0053TWW9K", "6304936532", "B00009YXHN", "B00JQYV0B4", "B004EI2NPO", "B001B8XRT6", "B008874968", "B0000AOX09", "B00AGKH4MG", "B00009WNXA", "B00FYV7WCY", "B0000AOX0E", "B00009PY2T", "B002I41KNC", "B00J0IN6Z4", "B00FXOO1VC", "B002HML6YI", "B0024FAG44", "B000TZJCMS", "B0009X75J2", "157362408X", "B00004Y87O", "B000MV8AC2", "B000RPCJA2", "B000S0GYRU", "B002GHHHG0", "0783228457", "B008WAM2E2", "B00DOZNGTK", "B00D7AM6M0", "B000HEWEGC", "B00BTYPW7C", "B00005O439", "B000F3UA8E", "B00005KH30", "B001AGNMFI", "B00009OWI1", "6305258287", "B0053TWW36", "B0001ZX0GK", "B0002S9QUA", "B00IA1VKVY", "B0001XAKUQ", "B009EUVXZI", "0792841328", "B0002C9DK4", "B004EI2NP4", "B000QUCQX8", "B00005NRN6", "B00009MEC4", "B00003CY6P", "B001D5C1OO", "B000MV8ZCW", "B00006CXGP", "B006QWC2ZC", "B00G5GNYY2", "B0067QPVJ6", "B0001LQJMQ", "B000IJ7A5Q", "8598310042", "B00J81S92S", "B00023P4TM", "B000WC389G", "0790742829", "B000TUDBFC", "B0007WQHI0", "B00EZ50SGW", "B001J710Y8", "B0001611DI", "B002LMSWN2", "B00DBPBOZG", "B0014VPFVS", "B0053TWVIM", "B000MDFTHE"], "bought_together": ["B0000AOX0A"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0000AOX0A", "B0000AOX0F", "B00KDU8HQQ", "B000AM6OQ2"]}, "price": 27.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 56503}, "asin": "078062856X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/411R7MSBQ1L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "In the Mouth of Madness"}
{"description": "While most of the recent outpouring of gay cinema tries to coast on a smile and a little bit of charm,Trickprovides some considerable filmmakingcojonesto back up its good looks: a talented cast, a witty screenplay, and a sweet sense of romance. Unfolding as part stressed-out fever dream and part farce,Trickchronicles one tumultuous night in the life of aspiring Broadway songwriter Gabe (Christian Campbell), who's suffering from both a heterosexual roommate (who kicks him out when there's female companionship) and a bad case of writer's block. Making an impulsive side trip to a gay bar, he locks eyes with a hunky go-go boy (J.P.&nbsp;Pitoc), who magically appears later that night on the subway, with amorous intentions to boot. Hotfooting their way back to Gabe's apartment, they're interruptedin medias resby Gabe's roommate, girlfriend in tow. From there it's downhill fast, as the two unsuccessfully scramble to find a place to finish things up. On their nighttime odyssey, though, both discover that there's more than sex and heat to their interaction. And much like its premise,Trickevolves from what seems to be a quickie one-night stand to something more substantial, a film with heart and a very funny soul. Jason Schafer's screenplay puts the luckless couple into one bind after another, and furnishes them with incredibly entertaining dialogue; fortunately, both the leads are up to the challenge of bringing it to life. Campbell (Neve's older brother) has a sweet smile and gentle comic timing; the surprise, however, is Pitoc, whose chiseled physique belies both a wicked sense of humor and a sincere-without-being-gooey romantic streak. Both are aided and abetted by a finely tuned supporting cast, most notably Clinton Leupp as an acidic, motor-mouthed drag queen and Tori Spelling in a go-for-broke star turn as Campbell's best friend, a painfully bad singer-actress. By the end of the movie, you'll be entirely won over, and anxiously awaiting a second date and more from these actors and filmmakers.--Mark Englehart", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 427510}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.28, "brand": "", "asin": "0780629159", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71H29PJKRSL._SY300_.gif", "title": "Trick [VHS]"}

{"description": "In the vastly overrated 1998 bookEasy Riders, Raging Bulls, author Peter Biskind puts the blame for Hollywood's blockbuster mentality at least partially on Steven Spielberg's box-office success with this adaptation of Peter Benchley's bestselling novel. But you can't blame Spielberg for making a terrific movie, whichJawsdefinitely is. The story of a Long Island town whose summer tourist business is suddenly threatened by great-white-shark attacks on humans bypasses the potboiler trappings of Benchley's book and goes straight for the jugular with beautifully crafted, crowd-pleasing sequences of action and suspense supported by a trio of terrific performances by Roy Scheider (as the local sheriff), Richard Dreyfuss (as a shark specialist), and particularly Robert Shaw (as the old fisherman who offers to hunt the shark down). The sequences on Shaw's boat--as the three of them realize that in fact the shark is huntingthem--are what entertaining moviemaking is all about.--Marshall Fine", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005B6ND", "6300183181", "0784011923", "0767825411", "6305814694", "B00000JGEI", "6303148352", "6303506291", "630018403X", "B00000490M", "6300214753", "6304932553", "630442972X", "6300269639", "B0000048S1", "B000005PFL", "6302765536", "6302091632", "6302824729", "6303344224", "6301570723", "6300247171", "B00008WFU5", "6305576173", "6300183467", "0790743213", "6304143184", "6303402348", "1558808221", "6303020089", "B000063UUL", "B00005B238", "6303212379", "B00005A8XX", "0790731436", "0783226152", "0790705141", "6300267881", "B00008WFU4", "6300181340", "630157401X", "6302921058", "6300214060", "6302968143", "1558802258", "0792102320", "6300214087", "6300268993", "B0000BWVBD", "B002GHHHL0", "6301888901", "B00005JKDQ", "6303122647", "6302800420", "6303610811", "6301827732", "6303540082", "6302374189", "0800198395", "6300214435", "6304071876", "6301208773", "B00000IO4G", "B00006G8LB", "B0087ZG7HK", "B00008DZ83", "6300214710", "6300215814", "630220366X", "6304457324", "0800116917", "B000059XY5", "6303212263", "6300216500", "6303236863", "630533577X", "6300213986", "6302415853", "6304935811", "6302820448", "B00004U8P4", "6300214311", "6301798503", "0793927501", "6300214370", "6302787564", "6304288433", "6300182878", "B000003KHS", "6301971809", "B000007OY0", "0790734079", "630336568X", "0790733927", "0790742322", "6301966988", "0764006770", "B000059XVO", "B00023BLXA"], "also_viewed": ["B00008WFU5", "6301792734", "6305814694", "B00005B6ND", "0784011923", "0767825411", "6300214060", "6300183181", "6300247171", "B00005A8XX", "6303506291", "B00006AL1C", "0792151712", "6304539258", "630018403X", "6305363668", "B00008WFU4", "B00000JGEI", "B00078XGO2", "6304117752", "6301574117", "0800116917", "B000005PPB", "B0056BE0SG", "6302091632", "080010367X", "6304143184", "6300216845", "6304539274", "6303148352", "0792158261", "B00000JS61", "0792839846", "6303212379", "0792837614", "0783222955", "0783221347", "0790700506", "6302921058", "6301797906", "6301976983", "6305123616", "6303402070", "6304429274", "1558807780", "B00005JKDQ", "6300214370", "6302936381", "B00000JGEK", "B0000AQZYM", "B00000JXVM", "B0007KTBIU", "0790734079", "6304039522", "6300214753", "B00005NCCP", "B005FHWWXQ", "B0087F7VSY", "B00KDU8HQQ"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 177995}, "asin": "0783216084", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514JQY1K3TL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Jaws [VHS]"}
{"description": "Director Martin Scorsese reunites with members of hisGoodFellasgang (writer Nicholas Pileggi; actors Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, and Frank Vincent) for a three-hour epic about the rise and fall of mobster Sam &quot;Ace&quot; Rothstein (De Niro), a character based on real-life gangster Frank &quot;Lefty&quot; Rosenthal. (It's modeled after onWiseguyandGoodFellasand Pileggi's true crime bookCasino: Love and Honor in Las Vegas.)  Through Rothstein, the picture tells the story of how the Mafia seized, and finally lost control of, Las Vegas gambling. The first hour plays like a fascinating documentary, intricately detailing the inner workings of Vegas casinos. Sharon Stone is the stand out among the actors; she nabbed an Oscar nomination for her role as the voracious Ginger, the glitzy call girl who becomes Rothstein's wife. The film is not as fast paced or gripping as Scorsese's earlier gangster pictures (Mean StreetsandGoodFellas), but it's still absorbing. And, hey--it's Scorsese!--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000P0J09M", "B000C20VRS", "B00004XPPB", "B000P0J0AG", "B0000AM6JI", "B0006GAOJA", "B0019L770A", "B0019L21GA", "B00003CXWV", "0767830555", "B000286RP2", "B0018CMJSU", "B000M341QE", "B004SIP7TE", "B002CPMB9O", "B00AEBB9NM", "B00004U103", "B0000DI87S", "B00008975Z", "B00013RC2U", "B00CCMKPO0", "B0019L21H4", "B000A2UBN4", "B006TTC5HC", "B004SIP95G", "B007TBIUSM", "B002QEHPQU", "B000H5TH20", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00005V9HH", "B00G1C2URC", "B00011CZRE", "B002VWNIEA", "B002T9H2LA", "B0000AMJEK", "B0001FGBUW", "B000P0J0EW", "B000A7DVR2", "6305313687", "B004G7XCRQ", "B000P0J0D8", "B000LP6KNU", "B0007DFJ0G", "1558908390", "B000P0J09C", "B00080ZG10", "B00005B6JZ", "B000CNESTE", "B004FQX5B6", "B000067IZ3", "B004U7MR14", "0783229526", "B00H9KKGTO", "B00008RH3L", "B0018CWW5K", "B002CA68N4", "B00562D3Y2", "B006X08FGW", "B007D5E7C2", "B000SFOW8I", "B008R65XYC", "B00005ATQB", "B00001ZWUS", "B000EHSVRI", "B00AEFXESQ", "B0009A40ES", "B002ZG99N6", "B003ELKNH2", "B000OT6V0K", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B000002OZ9", "B000MZHW40", "B00AEFXKUI", "B004L9GMBC", "B00006RCNV", "B000PAAJZ6", "B001JIE7JC", "B00AEBB95K", "B004SIP93S", "B000E5KQHI", "B00IEK9U0E", "B0000AMRJE", "B000ZM1MGE", "B000QEIOT4", "B0041QSZS8", "B000093FLA", "B0000YEE6M", "B002VWNIDG", "B00029RTAI", "B002NZK5QO", "B00AEBB9CS", "B00079Z9VO", "B00AEBB8LA", "B007SPPANM", "B000035Z5G", "B00004XPPG", "079284646X", "B000FI8MPW", "B003AWRMCE", "B00AEFY0F2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000P0J09M", "B000C20VRS", "B008R65XYC", "B000M341QE"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 158336}, "asin": "0783225792", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/712YQJ017YL._SY300_.gif", "title": "Casino"}
{"description": "When attorney Julie Hastings (Frances McDormand) uncovers corrupt city real estate dealings, evil thugs attack her scientist boyfriend, Peyton Westlake (Liam Neeson). Left for dead after his lab is detonated, he miraculously survives when the ensuing blast hurls him into the nearby harbor. Treated as a John Doe at a city hospital, he is unknowingly submitted to radical therapy which numbs his nerves to feeling--but which heightens his strength and his emotions. Once conscious, Peyton escapes from the hospital and builds a ramshackle lab in an abandoned industrial plant. Horribly burned and scarred by the lab explosion, he uses synthetic skin to impersonate his would-be murderers and seek retribution for their evil deeds. Peyton also tries to reunite with Julie, who believes him to be dead. While the film has an average script, it is overcome by the flashy cinematography of Bill Pope, the bombastic score by Danny Elfman, and the well-choreographed direction of Sam Raimi. The director confidently walks the line between suspense, action, comedy, and romance as he examines a bitter, victimized antihero who risks becoming as monstrous on the inside as he appears on the outside.--Bryan Reesman", "related": {"also_bought": ["078323046X", "078321958X", "B0003JANT6", "B00BTYMPUY", "B0007PALZ2", "B003498SCQ", "078322799X", "B0009X768W", "B00005N7Z1", "B0002J58HO", "6305428514", "B00003CXQA", "B002AS466O", "B0009PVZD2", "B005LAIIRQ", "B001R3YRG2", "B0009X76XC", "B004A8ZX28", "B0015XHQT4", "B00AEFXCLU", "B0085A9HU6", "B000RW3VCK", "B00005JLWN", "B00007AJG4", "B00005K3NR", "0783225520", "B001F7MSFM", "079284646X", "B00008L3UM", "B002O3Z4ZW", "B0000A9GHD", "1558908846", "B00004Y87O", "B00FQPLZ08", "B000OVLBHG", "B001J710Y8", "0767802454", "B0001Z37HM", "0783227434", "0783229402", "B00026ZG10", "B00008G8LY", "6304698747", "B005J9ZFQG", "B000PMFRZQ", "B0045HCJGC", "0767821629", "0767817710", "B000NOIVT0", "B001JFZ118", "B001B43IVW", "B00005JKWJ", "B00005N5RM", "B000068IEV", "B0045HCJG2", "0783223609", "B0007PALGG", "B0024FADD8", "078401132X", "6304723113", "B0001VTPW2", "B00000ILDD", "6305767866", "079283366X", "B001TODCII", "B00005M2CO", "B00J2PQYYK", "B0067EKYAY", "B000FFJYAC", "B00BPEJWAE", "B002GHHHG0", "B002ZG994U", "B0007V6ITE", "B000MV8ABS", "B000NIBURQ", "B0040J1RX6", "B00001O2H0", "B004BZ5AN2", "0767815718", "B00003CXKA", "B003XURDAY", "0767811097", "B0002KVUKM", "B007ZC31R0", "B009AMAJPA", "0783226934", "B001FZQOW2", "B008G33PIM", "B0000UJL96", "B00004XMSC", "B00441GYZG", "B00DW5IKW0", "B003AWRM9W", "B00441GYXS", "B000031EG1", "0790729342", "B000NO1XJA", "B0090EDEM8", "B00007AJGH", "B003UGLCIA"], "bought_together": ["078323046X", "B0003JANT6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000PFUAP0", "078321958X", "6305841985", "B00GHH9IIA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 56997}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.86, "brand": "Universal", "asin": "0783226012", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51B63F94CML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Darkman"}

{"description": "After building up the duo's popularity through popular recordings and several performances onSaturday Night Live,John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd--as \"legendary\" Chicago blues brothers Jake and Elwood Blues--took their act to the big screen in this action-packed hit from 1980. As Jake and Elwood struggle to reunite their old band and save the Chicago orphanage where they were raised, they wreak enough good-natured havoc to attract the entire Cook County police force. The result is a big-budget stunt-fest on a scale rarely attempted before or since, including extended car chases that result in the wanton destruction of shopping malls and more police cars than you can count. Along the way there's plenty of music to punctuate the action, including performances by Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin, Cab Calloway, and James Brown that are guaranteed to knock you out. As played with deadpan wit by Belushi and Aykroyd, the Blues Brothers are \"on a mission from God,\" and that gives them a kind of reckless glee that keeps the movie from losing its comedic appeal. Otherwise this might have been just a bloated marathon of mayhem that quickly wears out its welcome (which is how some critics described this film and its 1998 sequel). Keep an eye out for Steven Spielberg as the city clerk who stamps some crucial paperwork near the end of the film.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783227078", "6300182150", "B000005PFL", "0800198395", "6302877881", "6301569385", "6300989003", "630220366X", "6305576173", "B000006N70", "6304071876", "6301300394", "B00005Q4GY", "6301971809", "630281622X", "0800132009", "B0000068ZQ", "6305363668", "B00005RRG6", "6301697294", "6304196954", "0783202253", "6300181987", "6301208773", "6302032377", "0800116917", "6304107250", "6303168507", "0766202771", "0783235607", "6300246965", "B000077VT7", "6302909023", "630150528X", "6304155972", "B000005QWI", "B000007PI9", "630470786X", "6300214567", "6303057225", "0792839846", "B00000JGEK"], "bought_together": ["0783227078"], "also_viewed": ["6300182150", "B000005PFL", "B00000JKNP", "B00003CXCQ", "B00G5G7EXY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 240790}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.98, "brand": "", "asin": "0783225199", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41BZ5ANGQ2L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Blues Brothers [VHS]"}

{"description": "A movie that only true horror buffs could love,Army of Darknessis officially part 3 in the wild and wacky Evil Dead trilogy masterminded by the perversely inventive director Sam Raimi, who would later serve as executive producer of the popular syndicated TV seriesHercules: The Legendary Journeys.Raimi's favorite actor, Bruce Campbell, returns as Ash (hero of the first two Evil Dead flicks), a hardware-store clerk who is magically transported--along with his beat-up Oldsmobile and a chainsaw attachment for his severed left forearm--to the brutal battlefields of the 14th century. He quickly assumes power (who else in the Middle Ages packs a shotgun and a chainsaw?), and unites his band of medieval knights against the dreaded Army of the Dead. Raimi gleefully subverts almost every horror-movie clich&eacute; as he serves up a nonstop parade of blood, gore, and vicious sword-bearing skeletons--an affectionate homage to animator Ray Harryhausen's classicJason and the Argonauts. The frantic action is fun while it lasts, but even at 80 minutesArmy of Darknessnearly wears out its welcome. You know that Raimi can maintain the mayhem for only so long before it grows tiresome, and fortunately this madcap movie quits while it's ahead.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B005J9ZFQG", "B000WC3864", "B008JFUNYG", "B001KEGR5M", "B0001LQJMQ", "B003S6S7TY", "B004GGU9K0", "B000QUCQX8", "B008CYDD7I", "B005J9ZE5I", "B00C6F61IW", "B004GGU9JQ", "B00004Y87O", "B000WC38FA", "B000AQ69QS", "B0006A9FKA", "B00IF8Q0YE", "B0013D8LAE", "B000RIWAVW", "B0002C9DK4", "B000F7CMPE", "B0001611DI", "B0000AOX0F", "B002LMSWN2", "B000FS9FE4", "B0002CHK1S", "157362408X", "B000IJ7A5Q", "B002GHHHG0", "B00D7AM6M0", "B000I2J68M", "B00009MGEM", "B001NPD9LS", "B00AQJ8MLY", "B000VKL6Z2", "B004SIP6LS", "B00007AJG4", "B002JT69IW", "0790729342", "B0009OUBC4", "B00005JA8B", "B001D5C1OO", "B000V4UFZK", "B00005LC4Q", "B0056P6SOG", "B004P7CMOQ", "B000UAE7O0", "B000WC389G", "B0016MJ6P6", "B000I0RNVQ", "B008WAM2E2", "B0001US7OA", "B00005N5RM", "B00AEFY2WI", "B000FJH5MC", "B000099T3M", "B004EI2NP4", "B00005JO16", "B008G33PIM", "B001DJLD1W", "B000TSIJWY", "B001DJLD0S", "B000AXWHSA", "B000FA57UI", "B00AEFXW8I", "B00018D42W", "B000068IEV", "B000S0GYRU", "B000FA57US", "6304712499", "B001B8XRT6", "B002VWNIDG", "B002OVO18A", "B0002ABURA", "B00006FDCD", "B00AEFYDM2", "B0028DRGDQ", "B008874968", "B0000AOX09", "B001KEGR5W", "B0000VCZNE", "0312291450", "B0087ZG7UW", "B0024FAG44", "B0053TWV46", "B0058I9DZM", "B003VMFWXO", "B003WTO5NO", "B0015U0QWG", "B004XVMCH6", "B004LWZW24", "B001B1UO6W", "B005HI4LMS", "B000LP6KNU", "B004SIP9Z6", "B00317LM8S", "B0031U8OEK", "B0024FADBA", "B000C20VRS"], "bought_together": ["B005J9ZFQG", "B000WC3864"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005J9ZFQG", "B00005R24K", "B008JFUNYG", "B009JBWOU0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 22777}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.74, "brand": "Universal Studios", "asin": "0783227434", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DQ0H428VL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Army of Darkness"}

{"description": "John Wayne and Kirk Douglas make a delightful duo in this comedic Western in which Wayne seeks revenge on a ruthless mine owner (Bruce Cabot) who had him framed and sent to prison. Upon his release, Wayne recruits Douglas in a scheme to raid and rob one of Cabot's gold-laden wagons, despite the fact that Douglas had been offered good money to kill Wayne. He joins Wayne instead (the potential profits being much greater), and they set out to ambush the War Wagon, so named because it's heavily armored, mounted with a Gatling gun, and guarded by a dozen gunmen on horses. Costarring Keenan Wynn and Howard Keel as a wise-cracking Indian,The War Wagonwas a Western precursor to the action buddy films of the 1980s and '90s, serving up plenty of exciting action and constant comic relief. The interplay between Wayne and Douglas is sharp and sarcastic, and their motley crew of accomplices provides yet another source of character-driven humor. Not one of the greatest Westerns ever made, but certainly one of the most lightly entertaining.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00008CMR6", "B000O599YE", "B00008CMR4", "B00AEFXUL2", "B00008MTW5", "B000O599Y4", "078322592X", "B00008MTW7", "B0045HCJSK", "B000O59A0C", "B000ANVPP6", "0783230478", "B00008MTW6", "B000O599NK", "B00AEBBA0E", "B000ANVPPQ", "B000O599YO", "B00AEFXSVE", "B000059TFU", "B0082LUFA4", "B00AEBB8YM", "B000O599WQ", "B000O599NA", "B00AEFY6ZQ", "B00005ASGH", "B00AEFYBA6", "B00C6QYMJG", "B000O599YY", "B000U1ZV6M", "B00AEFYL6K", "6304696612", "B0009ML2JC", "B000O599ZS", "B001PO54OM", "B000O599US", "B009YX8MSG", "B00008CMT3", "B00008CMT4", "B0015TJBXW", "B000O599VM", "B0009ML2KQ", "B00004ZBVE", "B000BPL2FG", "B000O599W6", "B0007MAO0C", "B00BFWKE62", "B001PO55LE", "B006VRRGOO", "B000O599XU", "B000O77LY2", "B000O599N0", "B001R0AY9Y", "B000O599NU", "B00005JLV5", "B000O599X0", "B0018O4RT2", "B003ASLJS6", "B00005N89K", "B0001FVDX2", "B00BTYU3UI", "B00393SG0G", "B000O599Z8", "B000BPL2HO", "B00005N5S3", "B00AEFYPHA", "B00AMQGFYM", "B000N3SSBW", "B006PA0TRI", "B0047BXR94", "B003ASLJRC", "B005FUTC2W", "B0007TKNGA", "B000056H2H", "B00008CMR1", "B004DY1VIO", "0783230400", "B000O599MG", "B00AEBB932", "B000OT6V0U", "0783228007", "B00005LOL0", "B007KFZ7Y2", "B000O599M6", "B00BGQ2P9G", "B000BITVBA", "B000O599LW", "B000059TFW", "B006PA19VS", "B000FTCLQC", "B00195I3OK", "B000E5N6KW", "B00C3ALLFS", "B004GSVX8A", "B00008CMT1", "B000FZETR0", "B000O179JK", "B000H9AD5G", "B000O599ZI", "B004TJ1H3W", "B003ASLJNQ"], "bought_together": ["B00008CMR4", "B00008CMR6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B007KFZ7Y2", "B00008CMR6", "078322592X", "B00AEFXUL2"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 7286}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.35, "brand": "WAYNE,JOHN", "asin": "0783228031", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51cUCsOWQ6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The War Wagon"}

Directed by the original's James Whale (hislast horror film) and featuring a haunting musical score, The Bride of Frankenstein ranks as one of the finest films not only of the genre, but for all time.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00000JMOF", "B000035Z3K", "B00000JQB7", "B00005LC4L", "B00001TZ6Q", "0783240961", "B00005LC4K", "0783240953", "B00005LC4J", "078324097X", "B00005LC4N", "B000EHQTZO", "B00005LC4M", "0783233582", "B000G6BLWE", "0767811097", "B00000ILEU", "B000VUQ4HW", "B00005RF2C", "B00AEBB8VK", "B000A0GOFA", "B000AQKU72", "B007Y1NNAW", "B000HEWEDK", "B0045HCJS0", "B00005JKFR", "B00009NHC0", "B0087ZG7UW", "B0009X770E", "B0001CNRLG", "B000092T3P", "B00005NSXY", "B00005LC4O", "B00000F62P", "B0002NRRQU", "B0013D8LAE", "B002945DUW", "B000063UR0", "B00006JMQG", "B0024FADD8", "B009AGEY98", "B005D0RDKM", "B00003CXCF", "B001BSBBGC", "B003ZYU3U0", "B006TTC5J0", "B0007R4T26", "B0087ZG7PW", "B002VEWMGS", "B0040QYROA", "B00000K3U3", "B0045HCJJE", "B00006G8K0", "B0000694WH", "B0002HOERG", "B003M8NGG2", "B000A0GOF0", "B00065GX64", "B00005R1O7", "B000FOPPEC", "B0045HCJSA", "B00009NHBC", "B00DZP1C9K", "B000RXVNDI", "B00518A70E", "B0087ZG7OI", "B000B7MX7A", "B0001CNRLQ", "B00003CXBZ", "B0002CHK1S", "B00006G8JZ", "B000O599NA", "B00027JYLC", "B000ECX0O2", "B0009X770O", "B0002NRRRY", "B009KG7F30", "B00009PY38", "B00407PNWO", "B00005JKU0", "B00006JMQH", "B000GRUQL0", "B007Y1NR1W", "B000N3T0H8", "B004KDYR20", "B005AMJ3B0", "B001DB6J50", "0792833287", "B000GRUQK6", "B0006HBV3C", "B0087ZG7R0", "B003ZEQMH8", "B005ETANC2", "B00317LM8S", "B0004Z33DM", "B000FFJYA2", "B002TSAAS8", "B0007R4SZY", "B000A0GOFK", "B00005RERS"], "bought_together": ["B00000JMOF", "B000035Z3K"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B006TTC5J0", "B00000JMOF", "0783242379", "B00001TZ6Q"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 63234}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.05, "brand": "KARLOFF,BORIS", "asin": "078323502X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/512FP95JV4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Bride of Frankenstein (Universal Studios Classic Monster Collection)"}

{"description": "Paul Newman and Julie Andrews star in what must unfortunately be called one of Alfred Hitchcock's lesser efforts. Still, sub-par Hitchcock is better than a lot of what's out there, and this one is well worth a look. Newman plays cold war physicist Michael Armstrong, while Andrews plays his lovely assistant-and-fianc&eacute;e, Sarah Sherman. Armstrong has been working on a missile defense system that will \"make nuclear defense obsolete,\" and naturally both sides are very interested. All Sarah cares about is the fact that Michael has been acting awfully fishy lately. The suspense ofTorn Curtainis by nature not as thrilling as that in the average Hitchcock film--much of it involves sitting still and wondering if the bad guys are getting closer. Still, Hitchcock manages to amuse himself: there is some beautifully clever camera work and an excruciating sequence that illustrates the frequent Hitchcock point that death is not a tidy business.--Ali Davis", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0002IXSVI", "6300183513", "0790743213", "6300181340", "0783235682", "6300183580", "6301670159", "B000UVV25Q", "6301640667", "0783235615", "6300268748", "0783235607", "0783235674", "6301670140", "0783236352", "0783221347", "0783235593", "6301798503", "6303562248", "6301798759", "B000007NPV", "6301800974", "0783235623", "6300270386", "6303120474", "6304152450", "0800132009", "6301965760", "6303451535", "B00004RFFA", "B00000FZXC", "0782008348", "6300181529", "0792107683", "6300216217", "6305012792"], "bought_together": ["B0002IXSVI"], "also_viewed": ["B00BWJQEC6", "B00ARA4SLU", "B000CCW2TS", "B00F0IRN7U", "B001D8W7EK", "B00AQMGQVY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 233901}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.39, "brand": "", "asin": "0783235704", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51WFN1SW9TL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Torn Curtain [VHS]"}

{"description": "Two years before he let it all hang out inBoogie Nights, former rapper and Calvin Klein underwear model Mark Wahlberg played the psychotic boyfriend in this derivative but surprisingly effective thriller, aptly described by producer Brian Grazer as &quot;Fatal Attractionfor teens.&quot; Reese Witherspoon plays Nicole Walker, the unwitting teenager who gets the hots for David McCall (Wahlberg). David only seems like a nice guy until he gets upset by the girl's overly protective father. That's when hell breaks loose and the love-struck Romeo turns into a deadly threat who justwon'tgo away. You'd think this kind of material would be beneath the talents of a fine director like James Foley (whose credits includeAt Close RangeandGlengarry Glen Ross), but Foley gives the film just the right blend of style and tension to match Wahlberg's breakthrough role as an all-too-believable teenage maniac. You might feel silly afterwards, but don't be surprised if you find yourself getting caught up in the expertly manipulative suspense.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004P7CMVE", "0767818024", "B00AEFY0XE", "B000ZS8GWQ", "B000083C6I", "B00B83PJHM", "B00001PE4D", "B002GIBVVQ", "B001MTYRKC", "B00AEBB86A", "B000053VB2", "B000MMMTBY", "B005LAIGLE", "B001DZOC6Y", "B000U1ZV76", "B00BB67UNW", "6305213305", "B00004W4UD", "B000J3OTT6", "B00004RF85", "B00049QQHI", "B00000JGNP", "B00003CY5P", "B0000B1OFL", "157362554X", "B005LAII12", "B00441GYVK", "B00BEIYLO8", "B003UESJHO", "B00005JLIF", "B004P7CN7W", "B00005J761", "B00102F5WK", "B00006HAWN", "B00447L4KA", "B00009WVSL", "B002O3Z4Z2", "B00AEBBA2W", "B00AEFXT1S", "0767815718", "B00AEFXX9Q", "B000A5045Q", "B002ZG99H2", "B000P0J0C4", "B00002SSKI", "B00013RC7K", "0767824954", "B0002WT4OE", "B0001GF2D8", "B000M341QE", "B00BEIYN9Q", "6305899592", "B00008G8M5", "B002NZK5RI", "B00013WWT8", "B00003CWN3", "B00005RHGK", "B005CFBYW6", "B00AMEZDJW", "B001D2WU9I", "B002AT8KAG", "B0001LJCKC", "B0000524E5", "B004SIP9X8", "B00JOWHTB8", "B00005UQ6G", "B000069HZP", "B00AEFXUXU", "006095003X", "B0000JBUI2", "B00005JNCN", "0790732149", "B00003CXMP", "B0006FO8E8", "B001JV5BIA", "B00DHD933W", "B000FUTVVO", "B004499LX0", "B0001I562S", "B00AEFXO8Q", "B001OST0LW", "B0021L8UPS", "B0045O2PHS", "B002AT8K9W", "B0058ZPNBI", "B000BKJ762", "B00005JNY3", "B000A2UBN4", "B002DKGWSE", "B00366BBNU", "B00013RC2K", "B00004Z4WR", "B004SUDQ1I", "B00007E2F5", "B002XUBDRY", "B004O8OLO0", "6305313687", "B000CEV3M8", "B0052SO0H4", "B009XTF8KQ"], "bought_together": ["0767818024", "B00AEFY0XE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00001PE4D", "B00AEBB86A", "B00BB67UNW", "6305213305"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 7156}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.25, "brand": "UNI DIST CORP.

{"description": "Here's another gritty independent film that tries to invade Tarantino territory by casting Christopher Walken--that most reliable of indie-film actors--as a Mobster who gets chummy with a group of preppie-like young men and becomes the victim of a kidnapping scheme. One of the kidnappers (Henry Thomas) has a sister who's been abducted by another group of kidnappers, and they've bagged Walken for his Mob connections and negotiating power. What follows is a game of psychological strategy in which the desperate group of guys slowly lose their advantage to the smarter, more experienced gangster--even though they've got Walken tied to a chair. The situation turns volatile when the young men start to doubt the wisdom of their strategy and suspect betrayal within the group, andSuicide Kingsturns into a talky, repetitious thriller only partially redeemed by Denis Leary's cagey role as Walken's Mob lieutenant. The movie's a showcase for its cast of rising talent (including Jay Mohr, Jeremy Sisto, Johnny Galecki, and Sean Patrick Flanery), but not even Walken can hold it all together. What's best about the film is Leary's sinister presence in a peripheral role and Walken's trademark villainy, here toned down to a steady, simmering menace.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0001FGBUW", "B00000IQC9", "B002NO4ISG", "B00004ZBVF", "B0002I84EE", "B00007ELER", "B00008977D", "B0006Q94A0", "B000P0J0D8", "B007REV4LQ", "B002TZS57E", "B000Q66QG0", "B00382S9MS", "B004UVYQYQ", "B000UO4F7U", "B00005QJHP", "B0000A2ZTZ", "B005JJCMOO", "B000N8UXU6", "B00AEFXR8I", "B00005V9HQ", "B00005Q4CT", "B002665I8K", "B00062IESC", "B00011CZRE", "B000AGTPTG", "B0006N2DS8", "B00BLF9FYA", "B00008R9M3", "B000UNYK44", "B000GGSMC6", "B00682LSNM", "B00008RH3L", "B000CEXF5Q", "6305327041", "B000IY04Q8", "B00007E8UI", "B00004ZETA", "B004LS6CN6", "B000093FLA", "B00J5G1P2W", "6305313687", "B004U7MR14", "B002AF4Y9G", "B000CNESTE", "B0000AMJEK", "B0029EW7BA", "B009Z3PX0U", "B0012IX35I", "B006TTC5HC", "B004SIP95G", "B000F5GNX8", "B0009A40EI", "B00FGVS0D2", "B005YCEI9S", "B000063K1A", "B006TTC5DQ", "B0006BGXP4", "B00008975Z", "1594742596", "B000067J1O", "0767802519", "0783117140", "B000XPU66U", "B00000IRE6", "B00GS08Y3Q", "B00004YA67", "B00AEBBA4K", "B004CWLRF4", "B00000JNBX", "0792845811", "B004FQX5B6", "B00C2CDJ34", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B000UR9QXK", "B0001US7CC", "B008M6MG42", "B000FIMG7C", "0780631536", "B0009U7LOO", "B00005V9HH", "630542845X", "B00003CY1G", "B0012EM5CY", "B00C3JUJJS", "B002ZG99H2", "B0007WFXLW", "B00D9EJGAY", "B002ZG99N6", "B000P0J09M", "B0000DBJ2D", "B000069I1H", "0767818024", "076785344X", "B000W4TGIQ", "B0057ZAA6W", "B000VDDDVE", "B00CX7TOOG", "B00007LB4C", "B000GI3KGC"], "bought_together": ["B0001FGBUW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0001FGBUW", "B007REV4LQ", "B000P0J0AG", "B0006Q94A0"]}, "price": 9.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 211655}, "asin": "0784011516", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DP0899DFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Suicide Kings"}

Sweet, funny scenes abound, and the combination of innocence and sophistication would have done well in a live-action picture. Peggy Lee cowrote the songs and provides the voice of the Siamese cats in one of the film's best-known musical sequences.

{"description": "Todd Haynes, ever unpredictable, follows up his experimental trilogyPoisonand his restrainedSafewith this flamboyant study in glam rock through the kaleidoscopic lens ofCitizen Kane. Christian Bale plays Arthur Stuart, a reporter sent to investigate the legend of rock legend and bisexual pop icon Brian Slade (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers as a not-so-thinly veiled David Bowie), who disappeared a decade ago after staging his own mock assassination. But Arthur is flooded with memories of his own adolescence as he interviews Slade's friends and business associates, peeling back the layer of makeup and spangles that was the model of rebellion for a generation of middle-class British kids and discovering a hollow center. Ewan McGregor almost steals the film as the punk pioneer Curt Wild (equal parts Iggy Pop and Kurt Cobain), the genuine article to Slade's calculated, coifed image of glitter stardom.  Haynes's film lacks nothing in capturing the flamboyance and spectacle of the era with flashy filmmaking and kitschy costumes, and if the plot seems lost in the preening and visual fireworks, perhaps that's the point: behind the fa&ccedil;ades and manufactured fronts is nothing but glitter, energy, and a beat.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00000DLV3", "B00005QW5X", "B005TTEFZ8", "B000FO0AD8", "B0002JZT5A", "B00004ZBVO", "B00005UW73", "B000EQHXNW", "B001KEHAEE", "B000RIWAVC", "076782153X", "B00C7T0EPS", "B000255LIY", "B00080ZHD2", "B000GIXLXE", "B0057ZAA6W", "B00BTYXNPK", "B005M2AKJW", "0767819772", "B0079K4WEE", "B00020VZTS", "0783241909", "B0050ODZ6M", "B0006FO8E8", "B007WZTMCI", "B002ZG97O2", "B0013D8L7C", "B000HRMAPE", "B00009MEKN", "B002ZG9800", "B004XNNUZ2", "B004A8ZWV0", "6305499144", "B008N25X7M", "B00GTZWVXE", "B00133KFGW", "B0000A1HQI", "0786883995", "B0013D8LC2", "B007CEFTSA", "B0000648YK", "B00HQVB0Q4", "B000E6ESL2", "B0042RJWTC", "B000MGB6NM", "B00IKM5NJS", "B00005JLQH", "6305428093", "B00005JLHW", "B000E6ESKS", "B00IA7MFEO", "B00005JM2Y", "B000CBCWIK", "B0016MJ6T2", "B000059PQB", "B004MRX8D8", "B0083V2VYG", "1892649462", "B00GHP8SH4", "B0036TGSR6", "B000065V3W", "B00023P4I8", "B0013D8LCW", "B0007Y08QA", "B000KX0IM2", "B00CC2V7AQ", "B004THJ3BC", "B00008YLUX", "B004SIP8WU", "B000089760", "B002DLB1I4", "B002VJVCN2", "B001CC7PLM", "B00E5PHTR8", "B0009A40ES", "B00FRILRW0", "B000F6II1M", "B000P12LWY", "B001QUF3SW", "B000PAAJZ6", "B00996RSYM", "B00FGG60XY", "B006OB3K56", "B00005V5NU", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B00F98FOPE", "B001FBSLPE", "B00GS08Y3Q", "B00CBFB8QC", "B00014NE62", "B008JFX04G", "B0002I84JO", "B004SEUJXM", "B001BMN35K", "B000EHRVOM", "B00005JKJA", "B000E5KURY", "B00BSN0VZW", "B00GSA3K6C"], "bought_together": ["B00005QW5X"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005QW5X", "B00000DLV3", "B000RIWAVC", "B00004ZBVO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 172306}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.39, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "0788815741", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51JW0WJSRRL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Velvet Goldmine"}
{"description": "Martin Scorsese's 1990 masterpieceGoodFellasimmortalizes the hilarious, horrifying life of actual gangster Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), from his teen years on the streets of New York to his anonymous exile under the Witness Protection Program. The director's kinetic style is perfect for recounting Hill's ruthless rise to power in the 1950s as well as his drugged-out fall in the late 1970s; in fact, no one has ever rendered the mental dislocation of cocaine better than Scorsese. Scorsese uses period music perfectly, not just to summon a particular time but to set a precise mood.GoodFellasis at least as good asThe Godfatherwithout being in the least derivative of it. Joe Pesci's psycho improvisation of Mobster Tommy DeVito ignited Pesci as a star, Lorraine Bracco scores the performance of her life as the love of Hill's life, and every supporting role, from Paul Sorvino to Robert De Niro, is a miracle.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000C20VPA", "B000C20VRS", "B008R65XYC", "B000M341QE", "B0018CMJSU", "B0019L770A", "B0019L21GA", "B00004XPPB", "B000P0J0AG", "B0000DI87S", "B000P0J0EW", "B00003CXWV", "B00CCMKPO0", "B00G1C2URC", "B00004U103", "B00AEBB9NM", "B004SIP95G", "B002CPMB9O", "B0019L21H4", "B007TBIUSM", "B000286RP2", "B00011CZRE", "B004SIP8ZM", "B0006GAOJA", "B002T9H2LA", "B006TTC5HC", "B002VWNIEA", "0767830555", "B0000AMJEK", "B0000AM6JI", "B00005V9HH", "B004FQX5B6", "B000SFOW8I", "B00008975Z", "B002CA68N4", "6305313687", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00013RC2U", "0792174909", "B007D0FVRM", "B000A7DVR2", "B004G7XCRQ", "B002QEHPQU", "B003ASLJO0", "B000LP6KNU", "B000H5TH20", "B000P0J09C", "6305263248", "0783229526", "B00009W5CA", "B001C0I61M", "B000EHSVRI", "B00IEK9U0E", "B002ZG980U", "B004SIP7TE", "B004SIP7ZS", "B0006GAO5Y", "B00B0U2SFE", "B000ERVKBC", "B000A2UBN4", "B002AF4Y9G", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B0000714BS", "B000E5KQHI", "B00005JA8B", "B002O3Z4Y8", "B003AWRMCE", "B000P0J0EM", "1558908390", "B00080ZG10", "0767802519", "B003ELKNH2", "B003BV8I3Q", "B000035Z5G", "B00AEFXDO6", "B000E8NRBC", "B00000JGHV", "B00004RJ71", "B00AEBB9CS", "B004SIP93S", "B00AEFYSEA", "B004SIP6WW", "B003ASLJQS", "B0001Z4OXS", "B002VWNIDG", "0783225946", "B00AEBB9ZK", "B00AEFXXMI", "B0000A02TZ", "B000MZHW40", "B004SIP6GI", "B002ZG99N6", "B00AEBB95K", "B00AEFXP8K", "B00BB67UNW", "B00029RTAI", "B000P0J0D8", "B003ASLJOU", "B000Z8GZYW", "B003ASLJS6"], "bought_together": ["B000C20VPA", "B000C20VRS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000M341QE", "B0018CMJSU", "B000P0J0EW", "B00BCB1JJW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 120285}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.49, "brand": "WARNER STUDIOS", "asin": "0790729725", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41YHNBJW24L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "GoodFellas"}
{"description": "Stanley Kubrick'sThe Shiningis less an adaptation of Stephen King's bestselling horror novel than a complete reimagining of it from the inside out. In King's book, the Overlook Hotel is a haunted place that takes possession of its off-season caretaker and provokes him to murderous rage against his wife and young son. Kubrick's movie is an existential Road Runner cartoon (his steadicam scurrying through the hotel's labyrinthine hallways), in which the cavernously empty spaces inside the Overlook mirror the emptiness in the soul of the blocked writer, who's settled in for a long winter's hibernation. As many have pointed out, King's protagonist goes mad, but Kubrick's Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) is Looney Tunes from the moment we meet him--all arching eyebrows and mischievous grin. (Both Nicholson and Shelley Duvall reach new levels of hysteria in their performances, driven to extremes by the director's fanatical demands for take after take after take.)The Shiningis terrifying--but not in the way fans of the novel might expect. When it was redone as a TV miniseries (reportedly because of King's dissatisfaction with the Kubrick film), the famous topiary-animal attack (which was deemed impossible to film in 1980) was there--but the deeper horror was lost. Kubrick'sThe Shininggets under your skin and chills your bones; it stays with you, inhabits you, haunts you. And there's no place to hide...--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300267881", "0790734079", "B00005ATQA", "6302038308", "6300182770", "B0009RRUKW", "0783235607", "0783228317", "B00000J2KZ", "B00004RNAC", "0790736039", "B00023NRSM", "6304508611", "6300182878", "6302921058", "6304509154", "0783216084", "6300214087", "B00004W5UA", "6301427076", "630268644X", "B000003KHS", "B000AMW2TK", "0790700506", "6300181340", "6300214753", "6302054982", "0784011923", "6305363668", "6303686796", "6305095566", "630021639X", "6302822688", "6305576173", "0783246641", "6304994540", "6303953425", "B00004U8PA", "0792158261", "0792100085", "6300213986", "6300189015", "630533577X", "6300214826", "0792846303", "6304288433", "6300147630", "0792842111", "B000007OY0", "0790741512", "6302158176", "0792846311", "6300183416", "0800103106", "B000005PFL", "6300183211", "0790733927", "6301666569", "6301871952", "0767825411", "630339406X", "6303109950", "6300216500", "6300214192", "6300262731", "6303257674", "6304214502", "630018627X", "6300214311", "1558807381", "0792839234", "0767819187", "B00005B238", "0790731975", "6303579388", "B000059HFB", "6302798450", "B00000FZCU", "6303651461", "6303566391", "6302642175", "6301971582", "6300218058", "6301094352", "6300184064", "6300181278", "6304457383", "6300214672", "6300262855", "0800125762", "6303257305"], "bought_together": ["0790734079"], "also_viewed": ["6300147630", "6300182878", "B00005ATQA", "6300189015", "6300267881", "B00023NRSM", "6300213005", "6303953425", "0307743659", "6303148352", "0790734079", "B001AQT0Z4", "6300183211", "0784011923", "B00BBND56G", "0788806270"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 268792}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.0, "brand": "", "asin": "0790705141", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5106FV0S4PL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Shining [VHS]"}

{"description": "One of the key movies of the 1970s, when exciting, groundbreaking, personal films were still being made in Hollywood, Milos Forman'sOne Flew over the Cuckoo's Nestemphasized the humanistic story at the heart of Ken Kesey's more hallucinogenic novel. Jack Nicholson was born to play the part of Randle Patrick McMurphy, the rebellious inmate of a psychiatric hospital who fights back against the authorities' cold attitudes of institutional superiority, as personified by Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher). It's the classic antiestablishment tale of one man asserting his individuality in the face of a repressive, conformist system--and it works on every level. Forman populates his film with memorably eccentric faces, and gets such freshly detailed and spontaneous work from his ensemble that the picture sometimes feels like a documentary. Unlike a lot of films pitched at the &quot;youth culture&quot; of the 1970s,One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nestreally hasn't dated a bit, because the qualities of human nature that Forman captures--playfulness, courage, inspiration, pride, stubbornness--are universal and timeless. The film swept the Academy Awards for 1976, winning in all the major categories (picture, director, actor, actress, screenplay) for the first time since Frank Capra'sIt Happened One Nightin 1931.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002VWNIDG", "B000RTB0R6", "B006TTC5HC", "B000FVQLQQ", "B000P0J0EW", "0767830555", "B0043X1FL8", "B00003CWQR", "B004SIP7ZS", "B003ELKNH2", "B0006GAOJA", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00AEFXN9G", "0767811100", "0792833287", "B004SIP95G", "B0000YEEGM", "B00079Z9VO", "0451163966", "B00AEFYSWM", "B000P0J09M", "B008MIMWP8", "B000EHQU0S", "B006FE83UE", "B000M341QE", "B00AEFXESQ", "B00002VWE0", "B004SIP8ZM", "B002VWNIAY", "B00009W5CA", "0764586629", "B000ZM1MGE", "B00011CZRE", "B000P0J09C", "B0008ENHUI", "B00005V9HH", "B0019L770A", "B0019L21GA", "B00AEBB9CS", "B0050FXDDQ", "B000CNESTE", "B0006GANN2", "B000LP6KNU", "B000P0J0EM", "B00000IQV7", "B000055Y0X", "B00001ZWUS", "079073219X", "B0019UGYK0", "079284646X", "B00AEBB9F0", "B003ASLJO0", "B000A7DVR2", "B00AEBB9FA", "B0002B15ZG", "B004U7MR3M", "B000YAF4MA", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00066FBQG", "B00005JKIS", "6305144168", "B004SIP7TE", "B002ZG980U", "B00005ATQB", "B0045HCJ94", "0783229526", "B000A3XY5A", "B000093FLA", "B00026ZD04", "B004L9GMBC", "B0000DI87S", "B00006RCO1", "B0007PALZ2", "B0000JBALO", "B004IFYMYI", "B007N31YH0", "B000P0J0D8", "B000H4JH7Q", "B00B0U2SFE", "0792846443", "B007D0FVRM", "B000022TSY", "B0087ZG7UW", "B0002234LS", "B0045HCJ9E", "B0000A02TZ", "B001GD6VTE", "B00AEFYRP0", "0784011710", "B00009AOAZ", "B00005JLSB", "B000Q678OO", "0792838408", "6305882592", "B003LMPKSQ", "B00005MEOU", "B00AEFYSL8", "B0057ZAA6W", "B001AEF6BI", "B000HC2LHG"], "bought_together": ["B002VWNIDG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000P0J0EW", "0451163966", "B006TTC5HC", "B00AEFY0F2"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 40218}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.24, "brand": "WARNER STUDIOS", "asin": "0790732181", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51pJoIlXFbL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"}
{"description": "Some called it a snooze-fest, while others tearfully clutched their Kleenex. In any case, Clint Eastwood was an unusual and (as it turned out) perceptive choice to direct and costar in this lush adaptation of Robert James Waller's phenomenally bestselling novel.

The two fall in love while Francesca's husband and children are away at a county fair, but the story's passion and lasting appeal derive from their decision to part forever after just a few brief days of intimate connection. Superbly acted with an emphasis on quiet, graceful moments of tender revelation, the film builds to a crescendo of powerful and conflicting emotions.

In other words,Vegas Vacationis the kind of comedy that can convince you that civilization is doomed.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00407PNZ6", "B000G1R4RA", "B000VBIGD6", "B0000DZ3IE", "0792844831", "B000P0J0BK", "0790740044", "B000QUUD56", "B00AEBB9E6", "B001C5LLQ4", "B00287Z18Y", "0783227884", "B008R65XKQ", "B0018CWW5K", "B002O3Z4YI", "B0019HQICW", "B00005BJX6", "B00AEFXDO6", "B0009XEC3Y", "0783227388", "B003IVXR7Q", "B005LL817W", "B00009W5F3", "6305236569", "B00005QT9P", "B000BKJ762", "6305162018", "B000W1V5VU", "0783227981", "B00AJCUL1C", "B00004RJ73", "B000GCFNZO", "B007P9HW3M", "0790742012", "B00AEFY5TI", "B000BKVQS4", "B000P0J06A", "B000TJBN6W", "B005QX8UEE", "B00AEFXKIK", "B00006LPGP", "B00AEFXXMI", "B000Z8GZYW", "B00AEFY0F2", "B000K7VHTQ", "B00AEBBA2C", "B0000A14TA", "B001L2ZSJO", "B00178T122", "B0007P0XBO", "B00AEBB8LK", "B000065U1D", "B006VRRGRG", "B00028HBES", "B00AEFXVW0", "0790732157", "0783235070", "B001AEF6C2", "B0009X760U", "B007UJWR0K", "B00AJCUL2G", "B00AEFYS2M", "0790742071", "B00AEFYPXY", "B00005JNZU", "B00005JMYI", "B00AEFXPG2", "B0009RCPY8", "B00005V5NS"], "bought_together": ["B00407PNZ6", "B000VBIGD6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000VBIGD6", "0783227388", "B00287Z18Y", "B00008438V"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 199361}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 25.0, "brand": "Warner", "asin": "0790731878", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51FWN2QNE9L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Vegas Vacation (Full Screen Edition)"}
{"description": "Winner of four Academy Awards, including best picture, director, supporting actor, and best editing, Clint Eastwood's 1992 masterpiece stands as one of the greatest and most thematically compelling Westerns ever made. &quot;The movie summarized everything I feel about the Western,&quot; said Eastwood at the time of the film's release. &quot;The moral is the concern with gunplay.&quot; To illustrate that theme, Eastwood stars as a retired, once-ruthless killer-turned-gentle-widower and hog farmer. He accepts one last bounty-hunter mission--to find the men who brutalized a prostitute--to help support his two motherless children. Joined by his former partner (Morgan Freeman) and a cocky greenhorn (Jaimz Woolvett), he takes on a corrupt sheriff (Oscar winner Gene Hackman) in a showdown that makes the viewer feel the full impact of violence and its corruption of the soul. Dedicated to Eastwood's mentors Sergio Leone and Don Siegel and featuring a colorful role for Richard Harris, it's arguably Eastwood's crowning directorial achievement.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B003ASLJS6", "B003ASLJRC", "6304698801", "B000N3SSBW", "B0000TANUI", "6304711905", "0783225725", "B000E5N6LG", "B00388PK7O", "0767817710", "B001LMAK88", "B00000K0DM", "B003ASLJO0", "B000XR9L50", "0792839056", "B002M9WW3A", "B003ASLJOU", "B0015XHQT4", "B003ASLJNQ", "B000055Y0Y", "B003AWRMBU", "B003ASLJIQ", "B000O599ZS", "6304698798", "B000GFRI4K", "B00AEBBA0E", "B003UESJME", "B0018PH3L0", "B00AEBB932", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00008IHAW", "B0045HCJTO", "B00HETDQKG", "0783228007", "B004FPXMDI", "B007Y1NR1W", "B000P0J0EW", "B00AEFXVOI", "B000059TFW", "B003ASLJQI", "B00AEFYSEA", "B003ASLJKE", "B004AOECXI", "B003AWRMBA", "B00005LOL0", "B001LRJH0U", "B00001ZWUS", "B000W1SZBS", "B001M9ELQ2", "B000056H2J", "B003AWRM9M", "B00AEFYL6K", "B003AWRMC4", "B0006GANN2", "B000O599WQ", "B000NQRR34", "B0045HCJSK", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B00AEBB8YM", "B00008CMT4", "B003ASLJQS", "B0008ENHUS", "B00008CMR4", "B00AEBB9NM", "B000O599Y4", "0792842502", "6304696612", "B003NF97MQ", "B0010DR4BO", "B0007MAO0C", "B0006GAOJA", "0792838408", "B003AWRM9W", "B00009W5CA", "B00066FBQG", "B000O599YE", "0767830555", "078322592X", "B000BDH6DU", "B000BITVBA", "B003ASLJJU", "B001KRVLCI", "B0000A2ZU1", "B000P0J09M", "B00008PX7J", "B00005LC4R", "B00B0U2SFE", "B002VWNIBI", "B0010YVCI4", "B004SIP7ZS", "B002O3Z4XE", "B00132D7Y0", "079284646X", "B003XURDAY", "B003ASLJK4", "B0001FVDJQ", "B00004XPPC", "B00AEBB9CS", "B0007MANYY", "6304698747"], "bought_together": ["B003ASLJS6", "B003ASLJRC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003ASLJRC", "B003ASLJS6", "0792842502", "B004AOECXI"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 104810}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.95, "brand": "WARNER STUDIOS", "asin": "0790729644", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DRkkBZz0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Unforgiven (Snap Case)"}
{"description": "Readers of John Berendt's bestselling novel were bound to be at least somewhat disappointed by this big-screen adaptation, but despite mixed reaction from critics and audiences, there's still plenty to admire about director Clint Eastwood's take on the material. Readers will surely miss the rich atmosphere and societal detail that Berendt brought to his &quot;Savannah story,&quot; and the movie can only scratch the surface of Georgian history, tradition, and wealthy decadence underlying Berendt's fact-based murder mystery. Still, Eastwood maintains an assured focus on the wonderful eccentrics of Savannah, most notably a gay Savannah antiques dealer (superbly played by Kevin Spacey), who may or may not have killed his friend and alleged lover (Jude Law). John Cusack plays theTown & Countryjournalist who arrives in Savannah to find much more than he bargained for--including the city's legendary drag queen Lady Chablis (playing &quot;herself&quot;)--and John Lee Hancock's smoothly adapted screenplay succeeds in bringing Berendt's characters vividly to life with plenty of flavorful dialogue.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_viewed": ["0679751521", "B003ZHR6RK", "B00BXUASTE", "B00H7LJ2UO", "B00GMV8LIO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 130929}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.95, "brand": "", "asin": "0790734680", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51J385SC76L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Midnight in the Garden of Good &amp; Evil [VHS]"}

{"description": "An examination of the relationship between political power and personal conscience, Joseph Mankiewicz's traditionalJulius Caesar(1953) is a veritable master class for aspiring thespians. As the opportunistic Marc Antony, Marlon Brando delivers the famous funeral speech with pure conviction, elsewhere casting an intense physicality that recalls his work inA Streetcar Named Desire. James Mason suggests a latent Hamlet in his turn as the honorable Brutus, while John Gielgud is positively serpentine as the lean, hungry Cassius. Louis Calhern invests Caesar with intelligence and edgy noir echoes, and director Mankiewicz astutely balances the Renaissance view of Caesar as a power-obsessed, corrupt tyrant destined for punishment with modern suggestions that his murder may have been ill advised. The director's scrupulous pacing is supported in no small measure by Mikl&oacute;s R&oacute;sza's stunning score. At film's end, power itself is without a master, and the spirit of Caesar has been left unrevived: and to Mankiewicz's credit, the latter is revealed to be the true tragedy ofJulius Caesar.--Kevin Mulhall", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00B2BYY1W", "0780021320"], "also_viewed": ["B0002S93TO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 420217}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 19.95, "brand": "", "asin": "0790745801", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51R147CDJ0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Julius Caesar [VHS]"}

{"description": "Mel Gibson's Oscar-winning 1995Braveheartis an impassioned epic about William Wallace, the 13th-century Scottish leader of a popular revolt against England's tyrannical Edward I (Patrick McGoohan). Gibson cannily plays Wallace as a man trying to stay out of history's way until events force his hand, an attribute that instantly resonates with several of the actor's best-known roles, especiallyMad Max. The subsequent camaraderie and courage Wallace shares in the field with fellow warriors is pure enough and inspiring enough to bring envy to a viewer, and even as things go wrong for Wallace in the second half, the film does not easily cave in to a somber tone. One of the most impressive elements is the originality with which Gibson films battle scenes, featuring hundreds of extras wielding medieval weapons. After Eisenstein'sAlexander Nevsky, Orson Welles'sChimes at Midnight, and even Kenneth Branagh'sHenry V, you might think there is little new that could be done in creating scenes of ancient combat; yet Gibson does it.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00004XPQ6", "B00003CXE6", "6303953425", "6304935811", "B0001VL30O", "B000054OW2", "6302415853", "0790741512", "6304071876", "6301792734", "6303168507", "6303942830", "0800125762", "6300183211", "B000007OY0", "B000056BRF", "6300214540", "B000065U6Q", "B00004WIDB", "B00003CXTF", "B00007KK15", "079070546X", "B0000A36J1", "B00000K3AN", "6302482712", "6300263673", "6305169187", "0788811355", "B00003BE3X", "0800116917", "6304414099", "6303020089", "0792133153", "0790744589", "6302909023", "0800132009", "079212569X", "6300185095", "6303313345", "0767819462", "6304259131", "B00000K2SC", "0800199421", "B0001DI5W6", "B00005JLTM", "630018224X", "0790701251", "6304151306", "6303696813", "0790731274", "0792147618", "B00005RIJ3", "6301586026", "6302945089", "0783223218", "6305718792"], "bought_together": ["B00004XPQ6", "B00003CXE6"], "also_viewed": ["0792151712", "6303314015", "6301966988", "6303402348", "B00004WIDB", "0792116887", "6300213668", "0800125762", "B00004XPQ6", "0792842111", "B00003CXTF", "0788812408", "6302526574", "6303215734", "0788806270", "6300183211", "B00004U8P4", "0788802194"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 521725}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 0.5, "brand": "", "asin": "0792139771", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51PF2QYK62L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Braveheart (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]"}

{"description": "Martin Scorsese's brutal black-and-white biography of self-destructive boxer Jake LaMotta was chosen as the best film of the 1980s in a major critics' poll at the end of the decade, and it's a knockout piece of filmmaking. Robert De Niro plays LaMotta (famously putting on 50 pounds for the later scenes), a man tormented by demons he doesn't understand and prone to uncontrollably violent temper tantrums and fits of irrational jealousy. He marries a striking young blond (Cathy Moriarty), his sexual ideal, and then terrorizes her with never-ending accusations of infidelity. Jake is as frightening as he is pathetic, unable to control or comprehend the baser instincts that periodically, and without warning, turn him into the rampaging beast of the title. But as Roman Catholic Scorsese sees it, he works off his sins in the boxing ring, where his greatest athletic talent is his ability to withstand punishment. The fight scenes are astounding; they're like barbaric ritual dance numbers. Images smash into one another--a flashbulb, a spray of sweat, a fist, a geyser of blood--untilyoufeel dazed from the pummeling. Nominated for a handful of Academy Awards (including best picture and director),Raging Bullwon only two, for De Niro and for editor Thelma Schoonmacher.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["0767830555", "B000286RP2", "B006TTC5HC", "B000C20VPA", "B000P0J09M", "B0000DI87S", "B000A2UBN4", "B000CNESTE", "B004FQX5B6", "B00004XPPB", "B00AEFXN9G", "0792833287", "B00006RCNV", "B003ELKNH2", "B0050FXDDQ", "B0006GANN2", "B00003CXBU", "B0019L770A", "B00079Z9VO", "B000C20VRS", "B00AEBB9NM", "B000M341QE", "B004SIP7TE", "B000P0J0AG", "B00008975Z", "B0019L21GA", "B000WC39ZY", "079284646X", "B00AEBB95K", "B004SIP95G", "B0018CMJSU", "B002VWNIAY", "B00009W5CA", "6304907729", "B004SIP8ZM", "B000ARTN3I", "B00008RH3L", "B0000AM6JI", "B00005ATQB", "B000RTB0R6", "B003AWRMCE", "B00AEBB9CS", "B000286RR0", "B004L9GMBC", "6305263248", "B000LP6KNU", "B000P0J09C", "B0045HCJ8U", "B000P0J0EW", "B00080ZG10", "B00006ADD5", "B00004XPPC", "B00005V9HH", "B00003CWTI", "B002VWNIDG", "B003UESJHO", "B0006GAO5Y", "0792846109", "B00AEBB89C", "B002VWNICC", "B000063JDE", "B00005JKMQ", "B008R65XYC", "0767827902", "B000022TSY", "B002CPMB9O", "B00066FBQG", "B007STBUHI", "B0007DFJ0G", "B0001US62I", "B004U7MR14", "B00008O38F", "B000A7DVR2", "B001WLMOL4", "B000055Y0X", "B0087ZG7R0", "078324228X", "B0049985XW", "B003XURDAY", "B00GMT69C6", "B000063US2", "B00003CXWV", "B0045HCJTO", "B003ASLJQI", "B000CNESU8", "B000PAAJZ6", "B006FE83UE", "B00AEBB8NI", "B006TTC5MM", "0783225725", "0780618564", "B0019UGYK0", "B00001ZWUS", "6304698798", "6305941122", "B007Y1NR1W", "B003ZEQMH8", "6305918880", "B007TBIUSM", "B0087ZG7UW"], "bought_together": ["0767830555", "B006TTC5HC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00H9KKGTO", "B00008975Z", "B0018CMJSU", "B000C20VPA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 225981}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.7, "brand": "", "asin": "0792833236", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518QQEM9XPL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Raging Bull"}
{"description": "Maybe \"nobody's perfect,\" as one character in this masterpiece suggests. But some movies are perfect, andSome Like It Hotis one of them. In Chicago, during the Prohibition era, two skirt-chasing musicians, Joe and Jerry (Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon), inadvertently witness the St. Valentine's Day Massacre. In order to escape the wrath of gangland chief Spats Colombo (George Raft), the boys, in drag, join an all-woman band headed for Florida. They vie for the attention of the lead singer, Sugar Kane (Marilyn Monroe), a much-disappointed songbird who warbles \"I'm Through with Love\" but remains vulnerable to yet another unreliable saxophone player. (When Curtis courts her without his dress, he adopts the voice of Cary Grant--a spot-on impersonation.) The script by director Billy Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond is beautifully measured; everything works, like a flawless clock. Aspiring screenwriters would be well advised to throw away the how-to books and simply study this film. The bulk of the slapstick is handled by an unhinged Lemmon and the razor-sharp Joe E. Brown, who plays a horny retiree smitten by Jerry's feminine charms. For all the gags, the film is also wonderfully romantic, as Wilder indulges in just the right amounts of moonlight and the lilting melody of \"Park Avenue Fantasy.\"Some Like It Hotis so delightfully fizzy, it's hard to believe the shooting of the film was a headache, with an unhappy Monroe on her worst behavior. The results, however, are sublime.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302484383", "0790743213", "6302484405", "0792839846", "6303402070", "6302484391", "1558807780", "6301586026", "630233683X", "6303444202", "6304039506", "6300267865", "B000059GEE", "6302484421", "0790744759", "6300215814", "B00000F13T", "6304151306", "0792837630", "630150528X", "6301734734", "B0000068ZQ", "6301964012", "630197736X", "6302413435", "B000PYKZYC", "630018627X", "B00004RV8M", "0800100832", "6300183513", "6300181340", "6301963911", "6300246868", "0792840836", "6301798503", "6300251012", "B00000F6O0", "6301967410", "6301965701", "6300215717", "0783221347", "6300269256", "6301978110", "6300216233", "6304056877", "6302909023", "630347327X", "B00005OLY5", "630248443X", "6301797957", "6302305950", "0782008348", "0783235607", "6300215598", "0792840844", "630197705X", "0783235593", "6302801133", "0783236352", "B00005A1VH", "6300181820"], "bought_together": ["0790743213"], "also_viewed": ["6301792769", "B000E39M20", "1558807780", "6303402070", "6305123616", "630233683X", "6302484383", "0783222955"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 258664}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.0, "brand": "", "asin": "0792837096", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51M3WF4F9JL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Some Like It Hot [VHS]"}
{"description": "In the year 2018, violence and crime have been totally eliminated from society and given outlet in the brutal blood sport of rollerball, a high-velocity blend of football, hockey, and motor-cross racing sponsored by the multinational corporations that now control the world following the collapse of traditional politics. James Caan plays Jonathan E., the reigning superstar of rollerball, whose corporate controllers fear that Jonathan's popularity has endowed him with too much power. They begin to pressure him according to their own ruthless set of rules, but Jonathan has rules of his own--the rules of a man determined to retain his soul in a world gone mad. As directed by Norman Jewison (who was enjoying a peak of success during the early and mid-1970s),Rollerballcreates a believable society that's been rendered passive and compliant by the homogenization of corporate dictatorships, where the control and flow of information is the only currency of any importance. It's a world in which natural human aggressions have been sublimated and vented through the religious fervor toward rollerball and its players.Rollerballnow looks like one of those 1970s science fiction films (another example beingLogan's Run) that seems a bit dated and quaint, but its ideas are still provocative and fascinating, and the production is visually impressive. The DVD includes full-screen and widescreen versions of the film, audio commentary by director Norman Jewison, a behind-the-scenes featurette, an interactive \"rollergame,\" trivia, and production notes.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0038SUBEG", "B0045HCJKS", "B0013LL2Z2", "B0016I0AJG", "B00003CXTD", "B00004Y87O", "B000P0J0BU", "B000063UR1", "0792838947", "B00008438U", "B0002CHIKG", "B00DX88G16", "B0019BI1DM", "B00000IXPN", "B00AEBB8VK", "6305869103", "0446768391", "B004VT9JMG", "B0050MB5N4", "0792840453", "B001DE29SI", "B001BGS17Q", "B000059HAE", "B0000AOX0F", "B00004TX5G", "B00005V0XF", "B0045HCJSU", "B00AEFY3TA", "B00ESZZOLI", "0783225903", "B003XURDAY", "B00AEFYDM2", "1606730266", "B0038SUBF0", "B00466HNG8", "B000087F6L", "6304936532", "B00AKGG828", "B005FQ2H8W", "B00008974J", "B000MV8ABS", "0790750201", "B000AM6OQ2", "B00JQYV0B4", "B000LC4ZBW", "B00009PY48", "B0045HCJT4", "B000NTMA0G", "B0016LFG56", "B0002Y69V8", "B000FVQLKW", "6305869367", "B000BR9S96", "B00AEFYR3C", "B000063UR5", "B00020X88Y", "B000O78KWE", "0790731932", "B001JAFYFG", "B0040QYROA", "B00005JKFR", "0767802454", "B004KPLVV8", "B0003JAOO0", "B000055Y0X", "B005OT7YF6", "B000XT1P4S", "B000YDOOHI", "B004VT9JLM", "B00I099JO6", "B0002KPHZQ", "B00005N5S5", "B007Y1NNAW", "B004OB2EYQ", "B00005R2IS", "B00000IREA", "B00005ATQB", "B0015NORDW", "B00C3ALLDA", "6305944288", "B00097DY2A", "B000PKG6OE", "B0008191WO", "B000059H85", "6305428158", "B0000DBJ29", "B0000524FE", "B0001I55SS", "B00AEFXR8I", "B000HEWEDK", "B000EHQTZO", "0792839684", "B000KGGIV4", "B00C7A8WZQ", "B000N3SROU", "B0006B2A42", "B00518A70E", "B004GFGUDQ"], "bought_together": ["B0045HCJKS", "B0016I0AJG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00003CXTD", "B0045HCJKS", "B00JAQJMJ0", "0792838947"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 46508}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 25.45, "brand": "CAAN,JAMES", "asin": "0792838300", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51J8WABD9XL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Rollerball"}

A compelling masterpiece from world-class director/writer Stanley Kubrick and screenwriters Calder Willingham and JimThompson, Paths of Glory is a blistering indictment of military politics and \"an unforgettable movie experience\" (Newsweek).", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000KGGJ0Y", "B005152C9G", "B000UJ48SQ", "B00BTYJYR6", "B000UJ48VI", "B000055Y0X", "0783226039", "0792841387", "B007K8ILTW", "B004L9GMBC", "B00004XPPC", "B0013D8LKO", "B000P0J09C", "B00005U8F4", "0143106112", "B00005PJ8T", "6305999872", "B004O724M2", "B0042FDCR2", "B00005AUKD", "B00005ATQB", "B0011FDVGI", "B00006ADD5", "B0049985XW", "0767802470", "0780020707", "B001WLMOL4", "B000O78L0U", "B000UJCAKY", "B0087ZG7OI", "B000HWZ4CA", "B0010YSD7W", "B0046YK4KW", "B00005JPKE", "B00AQ6J64O", "B00D9BNONW", "0792839730", "B004SJVQ4I", "B00005UQ7T", "B00003CXBU", "079284646X", "B003ELKNH2", "B00AEBB89C", "B000G8NXYG", "B000EHSVS2", "B004HHX9XC", "B0002MHE1O", "B00008AOTN", "B005KQVE1S", "B0007TKNLA", "0767830555", "B0000639EU", "B000CNESN0", "B000K0YLZ0", "B005SQ3AO4", "B003ZEQMH8", "B00065GX64", "0792841662", "B00008PC13", "B0006GAOJA", "B002VWNIDG", "B0007Z0NYQ", "B000025RE7", "B002VWNIAY", "B00AEFYSEA", "B000M2E30O", "B00006RCNV", "B002E01MBA", "B000MTEFWS", "B000O599VC", "B00AEFXN9G", "B00DHN8G3U", "B0050FXDDQ", "B000O599ZS", "B000AQKUH2", "6305132917", "B003O7I6SE", "B0000AMRUP", "B006TTC5HC", "B0045HCJTO", "B00008LDO3", "B001DW2BIS", "B007Y1NR1W", "B0007TKNGA", "B00097DY2A", "B000MV90B2", "B0007PALZ2", "B0045HCJ8U", "B000TXNDV6", "B001KXZGO6", "B004NWPY3E", "B0006HBV3C", "0783225903", "B00AEFXG2U", "B00004XPPE", "0783228457", "0792841670", "B003AND1GY", "B008MIMWP8", "B000A2WJBQ"], "bought_together": ["B000KGGJ0Y", "B00BTYJYR6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005152C9G", "B000UJ48SQ", "B000KGGJ0Y", "0783226039"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 21200}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.99, "brand": "DOUGLAS,KIRK", "asin": "0792841409", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51TDZ1EGVPL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Paths of Glory"}

Jack's wife Caroline (Teri Garr) is compelled to get a job to make ends meet, and is soon hired on as an advertising executive in a firm run by the shifty Ron Richardson (Martin Mull). This leaves Jack at home doing the housework and taking care of the kids, which he discovers is a lot more complicated than he ever imagined. Moving from breadwinner to househusband doesn't do much for his self-esteem, and he bides his time playing poker for 10-cents-off coupons with the neighborhood housewives and pondering infidelity with dedicated home-wrecker Joan (Ann Jillian).

{"description": "Sir Richard Attenborough's 1982 multiple-Oscar winner (including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Actor for Ben Kingsley) is an engrossing, reverential look at the life of Mohandas K. Gandhi, who introduced the doctrine of nonviolent resistance to the colonized people of India and who ultimately gained the nation its independence. Kingsley is magnificent as Gandhi as he changes over the course of the three-hour film from an insignificant lawyer to an international leader and symbol. Strong on history (the historic division between India and Pakistan, still a huge problem today, can be seen in its formative stages here) as well as character and ideas, this is a fine film.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303686745", "B000056BRF", "B000AS7TO2"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 277110}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.0, "brand": "", "asin": "0800105141", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/511M01D7RKL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Gandhi [VHS]"}
{"description": "Mira Nair, the Indian director, scored an international art-house hit with her feature debut,Salaam Bombay!, a tale of life in the streets of seething urban India. Her next film was a surprising turnabout:Mississippi Masalais a cultural study and a love story set in the rural American south. The love story comes courtesy of Denzel Washington, as a rug cleaner, and Sarita Choudhury (from Nair'sKama Sutra), as the daughter of Indian immigrants running a small-time motel; both give fresh, charming performances. But Nair is equally interested in capturing the feelings of an exile's life, and Roshan Seth, the fine actor who played Nehru inGandhi, superbly catches the hope and sorrow of dislocation. Although the issues are serious, Nair maintains a breezy, naturalistic approach, and the various ingredients of this masala blend into a rich, flavorful stew.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301217977"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 385233}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 34.55, "brand": "", "asin": "0800115066", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51CF2Y5A69L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Mississippi Masala [VHS]"}
{"description": "If you think Jim Carrey's comedy is an acquired taste, think ofThe Cable Guyas a potent bottle of bittersweet wine. The film has a lingering aftertaste, but it is just a bit too dark, a bit too extreme to invite another serving. On the other hand, you've got to give Carrey some credit for risking his $20-million paycheck (and a big chunk of box-office revenue) on this black comedy. A needy, psychologically unbalanced cable-television installer (Carrey) forces his friendship upon an unsuspecting bachelor (Matthew Broderick) who has just broken up with his fianc&eacute;e. The movie gets edgier and more desperate--and in some respects funnier--as Carrey's cable guy gradually goes crazy. Director Ben Stiller manages to pack some pointed social commentary into the movie's many humorous detours.  Although it was a box-office disappointment,The Cable Guyis nevertheless a daring comedy for those who have had their fill ofAce Ventura.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00003CXE4", "0783235070", "B00081912E", "B00AEBB9SM", "B002BIULKS", "B000P0J06A", "B000BKJ762", "0790732157", "B003PIUIHO", "B001SN78JO", "B0000AKCKI", "B00003CWTL", "B000OYC7BW", "B004H83IJQ", "B000E8N8H0", "B008R65XUQ", "B002BIULL2", "B00AEBBA2C", "630529142X", "B00000K3UU", "B00005JL93", "B00AEFXIUK", "B0000CDRVX", "B006TTC5PY", "B00005NGAY", "B00005JM4Q", "B000ELJAEM", "B00AEFXPG2", "B00003CXPS", "B00AEFYZCU", "155890834X", "B0068FZ0O2", "B000HT386M", "B00009PY3X", "B00005JKNC", "B00005KA6V", "B000PHX5P0", "B00003GPFT", "B00005JMYI", "B004A8ZX3C", "B004H83IM8", "B00003CXO1", "B00005OCJP", "B000068TPB", "B00AEBB9K0", "0792842162", "B00AEFYS2M", "B00024JC4E", "B00177YA1K", "B000FP2OPO", "B0009P42WI", "B00005JMJG", "0783227345", "B000CPH9PM", "B000A3XYIM", "B00AEBB9GY", "B008R65XTC", "B000U1ZV4Y", "B0009HBPN0", "B002ZG971U", "6304806434", "6305161860", "B00AEFY0F2", "B000VXWX7E", "6305428263", "B00AEBB8NI", "B00004TJMW", "B000WZEZGI", "B0006GANPA", "6305433925", "B000068MBS", "B00AEFYIQ8", "B00AEFYPXY", "B000I0RNVQ", "B0016MOV92", "B00000K3U4", "0800195175", "B000067FP8", "B001G5T6GW", "B00E1HIX66", "B000MGBSJE", "B00013RC7K", "B00441GYVA", "B002ZG9800", "B0009ZE9VW", "B0000VD11E", "B0009X761E", "B0015XHQT4", "B000K405CY", "B004P7CMZ0", "B0016MJ6J2", "B00001U0BN", "6304711891", "B00003CXS7", "B000MCH5RM", "6305017115", "B00JHH21AE", "B00000JMOD", "B001AEF6C2"], "bought_together": ["B00003CXE4", "0783235070"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00003CXE4", "0783235070", "0790732157", "B00AEBB9SM"]}, "price": 13.49, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 32844}, "asin": "0800141687", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Q8NQFB21L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Cable Guy"}

{"description": "Director David Lean's masterful 1957 realization of PierreBoulle's novel remains a benchmark for war films, and a deeply absorbing movie by any standard--like most of Lean's canon,The Bridge on the River Kwaiachieves a richness in theme, narrative, and characterization that transcends genre.The story centers on a Japanese prison camp isolated deep in the jungles of Southeast Asia, where the remorseless Colonel Saito (Sessue Hayakawa) has been charged with building a vitally important railway bridge. His clash of wills with a British prisoner, the charismatic Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guinness), escalates into a duel of honor, Nicholson defying his captor's demands to win concessions for his troops. How the two officers reach a compromise, and Nicholson becomes obsessed with building that bridge, provides the story's thematic spine; the parallel movement of a team of commandos dispatched to stop the project, led by a British major (Jack Hawkins) and guided by an American escapee (William Holden), supplies the story's suspense and forward momentum.Shot on location in Sri Lanka,Kwaimoves with a careful, even deliberate pace that survivors of latter-day, high-concept blockbusters might find lulling--Lean doesn't pander to attention deficit disorders with an explosion every 15 minutes. Instead, he guides us toward the intersection of the two plots, accruing remarkable character details through extraordinary performances. Hayakawa's cruel camp commander is gradually revealed as a victim of his own sense of honor, Holden's callow opportunist proves heroic without softening his nihilistic edge, and Guinness (who won a Best Actor Oscar, one of the production's seven wins) disappears as only he can into Nicholson's brittle, duty-driven, delusional psychosis. His final glimpse of self-knowledge remains an astonishing moment--story, character, and image coalescing with explosive impact.Like Lean'sLawrence of Arabia,The Bridge on the River Kwaihas been beautifully restored and released in a highly recommended widescreen version that preserves its original aspect ratio.--Sam Sutherland", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302909023", "6304935811", "6304071876", "0800116917", "630150528X", "6301966317", "B0000040EJ", "6303168507", "0783222955", "6300181472", "0800113055", "0783221347", "6303057225", "6301797906", "0783235593", "6300181340", "6304151306", "6304196954", "6301965760", "B00005Q4GY", "6303494390", "6301977742", "6304291698", "6300988473", "6304117752", "6302797616", "B00007JME0", "630382336X", "0790752395", "B00005A1VH", "6301115430", "6300183513", "6302529441", "B000005PFL", "B00000F13T", "6304765347", "630274721X", "0782008348", "B000059HGY", "6301662954", "6300247031", "630018224X", "6301670140", "0792838408", "6304359675", "6304039522", "6300215601", "6304366078", "6300246965", "6300215539", "6303823351", "0800100832", "6301628454", "6300216721", "630407185X", "6304233639", "6300251152", "6300268748", "0790744589", "0790734060", "B00005Q4GZ", "0792116887", "6301798066", "0790701251", "6301976983", "6301972066", "B00004RFFA", "0800125762", "079212569X", "0792133153", "0790743213", "630442972X", "6301969049", "6300214540", "0783231482", "6300270025", "B00004TYS8", "6300183211", "6301587375", "B00000K3AN", "6300182533", "6301973259", "6304397941", "6301969251", "6300271315", "6303052223", "B00004RGUU", "0783235623", "B000062XM6", "6304458975", "B00004WIDB", "6305237115", "6301965701", "6302415853", "6303029027", "B000005PE7", "B0001DI5W6", "0792837533", "6301662946"], "bought_together": ["6302909023", "6301966317"], "also_viewed": ["0790743213", "6304071876", "B00BBND56G", "B000059HH1", "6305123616", "630233683X", "0783222955", "0783221347", "6304039522", "6300183513", "B000054OW2", "1558803602", "6301662954"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 223097}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.99, "brand": "", "asin": "0800132009", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51PF507DBSL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Bridge on the River Kwai [VHS]"}
{"description": "Thirteen-year-old Jenna (Shana Dowdeswell) has had enough with the trials of adolescence. In addition to being saddled with a devoted-but-nerdy best friend, Matt (Sean Marquette), she falls victim to one of the dangers of playing Seven Minutes in Heaven with the coolest kids in school: being stranded without a willing make-out partner. Humiliated, Jenna buries herself in the aforementioned make-out closet, wishing she could skip the whole adolescence bit and move straight into adulthood, and miraculously wakes up just weeks away from her 30th birthday. Of course, a lot has changed since going to bed the night before, not the least of which being an impressive set of womanly curves. The new, older Jenna (Jennifer Garner) is a successful magazine editor with friends in high places and a lion's share of potential suitors -- including a hockey-playing boyfriend and a swarthy married man. The problem is that her mind hasn't matured with her body; Jenna not only finds living on her own more terrifying than cool, but is quick to dismiss any male over the age of 14 as \"gross.\" Half excited, half mortified, Jenna seeks out Matt (Mark Ruffalo), whom she learns she had spurned as a teenager in an effort to join the popular crowd.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00006ZXSL", "B00AKGG6JS", "B00005O5CM", "B00AEFXO8Q", "B0015I2RT8", "B001OQCUYI", "B00005JMCW", "B001OQCUZM", "B00003CXSM", "B000J103OI", "B00AEFYM2S", "B002K0WBXW", "B00AEBB8R4", "B000EMGICS", "B004SIP9X8", "B003LSFM6U", "B0000897EG", "B000ELJAEM", "B00AEFY99O", "1401324142", "6304765266", "1416205152", "B00GO37I8Y", "0809229374", "B0001XAR1I", "B0001Z3TXE", "B00005JM55", "B00AEFYWQY", "B00007E2F5", "B0002VYOVI", "B00KS9V6EC", "B000J4QW7W", "B000YDBPAM", "B0007PLLBU", "B001TUZD8O", "B002ZG988M", "B0009OL7Z4", "B004SIP9RO", "B0000ZMGWK", "1400050138", "B0000DZ6N3", "B00AQS803A", "6302077818", "B00006ZXSK", "B00005JN0Z", "B000YAA68C", "B0007LXPBI", "B00E4Z7FQY", "B002P413IC", "B001ASQ9OM", "B006YTGL86", "B00795C5X4", "B00063KGPU", "B000BVM1S2", "B000209KMW", "B000A343RI", "B00062IVN0", "B000P0J0DS", "B00002SSKI", "6305428425", "B003TY2SWC", "B0051GLDVS", "B00008K7AM", "B0071HPOGK", "B0000AKCJK", "B000023VTP", "B00AEBB8YW", "B00006FMUW", "B002XTXG8O", "B00AMEZDJW", "B001AEF6BS", "B00447L4KA", "B000MQC9H4", "6305428042", "B002GOAH1U", "B0036TGSIK", "B002A5EBMQ", "B0000AOV4I", "B001C5LLQ4", "B000324Y98", "B00005JG6N", "6305236569", "B00AEFZ6V4", "B004EPZ070", "B003L20ICE", "B0038N9X3Q", "B00AEBBA2M", "B00005JN3W", "B0075RREYG", "B000F2BNW2", "0783235070", "B0021L8UO4", "0800177258", "B002SYAGNC", "B000HT386M", "B0007P0Y7C", "B000QUU4LY", "B00006ZXSN", "B00AEBB9WI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0013D8LFY", "B002K0WBXW", "B00AKGG6JS", "B001OQCUZM"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 461629}, "asin": "1404918051", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41EO6%2BQ3jvL.jpg", "title": "13 Going on 30: Fun &amp; Flirty Edition"}

After Mitchum makes clear his plans to harm Peck's family, a fascinating game of crisscrossing ethics and morality takes place. Where the more recent version seemed trapped in its explicitness, Thompson's film accomplishes a lot with a more economical and telling use of violence. The result is a richer character study with some Hitchcockian overtones regarding the nature of guilt.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301973232", "6301798759", "6302360978", "6302757096", "0790743159", "6302413435", "0800100832", "B00005B238", "6304429274", "6300183580", "6301798732", "6300216500", "6303402070", "0783235682", "6305012792", "6300181723", "630266232X", "6303039693", "0792838556", "079284517X", "6301975987", "6302158176", "6301805615", "6302484421", "0783235674", "0783236352"], "bought_together": ["6301973232"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 351347}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.97, "brand": "", "asin": "1558808590", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51V52EWT2CL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Cape Fear [VHS]"}
{"description": "Director Billy Wilder (Sunset Boulevard) and writer Raymond Chandler (The Big Sleep) adapted James M. Cain's hard-boiled novel into this wildly thrilling story of insurance man Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray), who schemes the perfect murder with the beautiful dame Phyllis Dietrichson (Barbara Stanwyck): kill Dietrichson's husband and make off with the insurance money. But, of course, in these plots things never quite go as planned, and Barton Keyes (Edward G. Robinson) is the wily insurance investigator who must sort things out. From the opening scene you know Neff is doomed, as the story is told in flashback; yet, to the film's credit, this doesn't diminish any of the tension of the movie. This early film noir flick is wonderfully campy by today's standards, and the dialogue is snappy (\"I thought you were smarter than the rest, Walter. But I was wrong. You're not smarter, just a little taller\"), filled with lots of \"dame\"s and \"baby\"s. Stanwyck is the ultimate femme fatale, and MacMurray, despite a career largely defined by roles as a softy (notably in the TV seriesMy Three Sonsand the movieThe Shaggy Dog), is convincingly cast against type as the hapless, love-struck sap.--Jenny Brown", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300215644", "0783236352", "6304039530", "6303402070", "6301975987", "6302226899", "6301973410", "6300215512", "6300183580", "6300183513", "6304457316", "B001D8W7EK", "6301640667", "6304359705", "6302909023", "6305999872", "B000003KE0", "0783221347", "6304429274", "0792837096", "6301797906", "630197350X", "0769403468", "B00AEFXN9G", "6301797957", "B00023P4FQ", "6304039506", "0790743213", "B001D8W7F4", "6305123616", "0783217390", "6302360978", "6302041090", "0800100832", "B000EVD38G", "6301773586", "0792839846", "B001D8W7EU", "B00008LDNZ", "6304119046", "6301798503", "0782008348", "630196697X", "6301969316", "6305012792", "0783235674", "B000AV4RQ2", "0792841409", "6301966430", "6300181421", "6301973232", "6301973259", "6302413400", "0792110269", "6303057225", "6302413435", "B001BZQMFA", "0800113055", "6300181405", "B000GX7MMA", "B000M7BEPQ", "6304111363", "6302227135", "6303396623", "6304039522", "1569942072", "B0045HCJ9E", "6302484383", "6302238331", "6300215741", "6301978536", "B00004TYS8", "6302700949", "0783217528", "0783235607", "6301586042", "6301976061", "B0047M6Y66", "0792841026", "6301800974", "6301798708", "0792837967", "6301798732", "6300181367", "B00005Q4GZ", "630266232X", "B0000040EO", "0790734079", "6302725542", "6300269310", "0783235682", "6301963911", "6301798562", "6301969049", "0792108280", "6300251012", "6302801133", "1558804226", "0792101448", "0764007440"], "bought_together": ["0783236352"], "also_viewed": ["B00I3C1T1Q", "6301797906", "6304429274", "6305123616", "B000005PPB", "B0050FXDDQ", "0800116917", "6301976983", "6304117752", "0783216084", "6303402070", "0792837096", "6304039522", "6301964012", "0792839846", "B009YX8MSG", "B00GST8UB8", "B00JAQJMJ0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 171937}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 24.0, "brand": "", "asin": "1558807780", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5164XM9AE3L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Double Indemnity [VHS]"}
{"description": "With the knockout one-two punch of 1992'sReservoir Dogsand 1994'sPulp Fictionwriter-director Quentin Tarantino stunned the filmmaking world, exploding into prominence as a cinematic heavyweight contender. ButPulp Fictionwas more than just the follow-up to an impressive first feature, or the winner of the Palme d'Or at Cannes Film Festival, or a script stuffed with the sort of juicy bubblegum dialogue actors just love to chew, or the vehicle that reestablished John Travolta on the A-list, or the relatively low-budget ($8 million) independent showcase for an ultrahip mixture of established marquee names and rising stars from the indie scene (among them Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, Bruce Willis, Ving Rhames, Harvey Keitel, Christopher Walken, Tim Roth, Amanda Plummer, Julia Sweeney, Kathy Griffin, and Phil Lamar). It was more, even, than an unprecedented $100-million-plus hit for indie distributor Miramax.Pulp Fictionwas a sensation. No, it was not the Second Coming (I actually thinkReservoir Dogsis a more substantial film; and P.T. Anderson outdid Tarantino in 1997 by making his directorial debut with two even more mature and accomplished pictures,Hard EightandBoogie Nights). ButPulp Fictionpacks so much energy and invention into telling its nonchronologically interwoven short stories (all about temptation, corruption, and redemption amongst modern criminals, large and small) it leaves viewers both exhilarated and exhausted--hearts racing and knuckles white from the ride. (Oh, and the infectious, surf-guitar-based soundtrack is tastier than a Royale with Cheese.)--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00008975Z", "B007D5E7C2", "B004U7MR14", "B0007DFJ0G", "B002T9H2LA", "B002AF4Y9G", "B004SIP8ZM", "6305313687", "B000P0J09M", "B000P0J0EW", "B005LAIIJY", "B000A7DVR2", "B00005V9HH", "B00011CZRE", "B004FQX5B6", "B00005JMUA", "B000P0J0D8", "B004P7CN5O", "B0019L770A", "B004SIP9Z6", "B0009A40ES", "B00003CXWV", "B000C20VPA", "B000LP6KNU", "B00005JMEW", "B000C20VRS", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00AEFXESQ", "B002VWNIDG", "0767830555", "B000093FLA", "B00009W5CA", "B0019L21GA", "B0006GAOJA", "B000M341QE", "B00003CXZ4", "B003ELKNH2", "B000P0J09C", "B002VWNIEA", "B00004XPPB", "B00029RTAI", "0767802519", "0783229526", "B000R7HY0K", "B000002OTL", "B00AEBB8NI", "B004SIP7TE", "B008R65XYC", "B0018CMJSU", "B002ZG980U", "079284646X", "B00AEFXXMI", "B004SIP7ZS", "B004SIP6LS", "B00079Z9VO", "B00005ATQB", "B00005JN0W", "B00004Z1FX", "0792833279", "B000WZEZGI", "B00AEFYS2M", "B001AEF6BI", "B0057ZAA6W", "B000M7XRAG", "B00AEBB9CS", "B00AEFXN9G", "B000UAE7O0", "B000A2UBN4", "B002VWNICC", "B000FS9FCG", "B000IY04Q8", "B001G5T6GW", "B00005N5S5", "B00005JLSB", "B006TTC5HC", "B003XURDAY", "B0019L21H4", "B00006D295", "B000AXWHSA", "0792838076", "B0006HBZE2", "B000P0J0AG", "B0009UC810", "B0050FXDDQ", "B0000DI87S", "B00AEFYSEA", "B0087ZG7R0", "B002CPMB9O", "B00AEBB9ZK", "B000BKJ762", "0800195175", "B00AEBB9NM", "B00GMV8M2Y", "0767836286", "B00H9KKGTO", "B00000ILDD", "6305327041", "B004SIP6GI", "B00005JMJG", "B003ASLJO0"], "bought_together": ["B007D5E7C2", "B00008975Z"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B007D0FVRM", "B0007DFJ0G", "B005LAIIJY", "B002T9H2LA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 77305}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.49, "brand": "", "asin": "1558908242", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51WG6GXWSCL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Pulp Fiction"}
{"description": "Judge Dreddis one of those movies that doesn't have a brain of its own, so it can only rip off a lot of ingredients from other, better movies. It's a mishmash ofBlade Runner,Total Recall, andThe Road Warrior, with a dash ofStar Warstossed in for good measure. As if that weren't enough, it's got Sylvester Stallone, who seems to be the only one in the movie who's in on the game and knows it's all a sci-fi scam. LikeThe Fifth Elementa few years later,Judge Dredddepicts a futuristic megalopolis packed with crowded vertical overgrowth and rampant commerce, where anarchy reigns supreme. Violent \"block wars\" are fought by lawless citizens with machine guns, and Judge Dredd (Stallone) is one of the city's heavily armed policemen, given free rein to judge and execute the perpetrators of violence. But Dredd himself is subjected to judgment and swift justice when his own gun is identified in the murder of a prominent TV reporter, forcing him to do whatever he can to clear his name. Diane Lane plays his partner in crime-fighting and romance, and Rob Schneider provides juvenile comic relief as Dredd's streetwise sidekick. Impressive special effects are on vivid display, and the movie's fun for what it's worth.

{"description": "Robert Bresson drew inspiration from Dostoevsky'sCrime and Punishmentfor this examination of an arrogant young pickpocket who deems himself above the laws and conditions of ordinary men. Michel (Martin LaSalle), a rather bland-looking young man with a perpetually blank face, haunts the subways, city streets, and racetracks to ply his trade. He plays a game of wits with a fatherly police inspector and walls his heart off from the affections of a quiet young woman, Jeanne (Marika Green), who looks after his dying mother. Bresson's direction of his \"models\" (as he calls his nonprofessional performers) strips them of affectation and motivation, making them blank slates defined by the accumulation of precisely drilled actions and words.Pickpocketis no thriller, though Bresson offers impressive, meticulously detailed scenes of daring and intimate robberies (one sequence on a subway feels like an homage to Sam Fuller'sPickup on South Street). Rather, it is a powerful, profound search for meaning and spiritual enlightenment by a man who believes in nothing but himself, and many critics consider it Bresson's masterpiece. Paul Schrader, whose bookTranscendental Cinemaoffers a detailed analysis of Bresson's work, has quoted the famous, emotionally restrained yet spiritually moving conclusion in two of his own films:American GigoloandLight Sleeper.--Sean Axmaker", "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 597369}, "asin": "1567301290", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21WTVB3RD3L.jpg", "title": "Pickpocket [VHS]"}

{"description": "Both a kind of home movie and a salute to the hip, pop-up sketch comedy of 1960s-early 1970s television--Laugh-In,Monty Python's Flying Circus, that sort of thing--Schizopolisis a hit-and-miss series of dada gags with vaguely connecting threads of Kafkaesque paranoia. Soderbergh himself stars as two people--one an ineffective dentist, the other a speechwriter for a cult movement called Eventualism, which has set out to \"question all answers\"--connected by their romances with the same woman, played by Soderbergh's real-life ex, Betsy Bramley. There isn't so much a story as a series of bits in which these characters often (though not necessarily) turn up, from press conferences on the subject of horse urination to old footage of nudists to a scene of an Eventualist exchange between husband and wife: \"Generic greeting!\" \"Generic greeting returned!\" None of this leads to a literal point, but after a while an undercurrent of disease about making sense of the modern world becomes apparent beneath the jokes. Soderbergh (sex, lies, and videotape,Out of Sight) is certainly a filmmaker who goes his own way in life, always hitting his target in one spot or another and occasionally getting a bull's-eye for his trouble.Schizopolisis no bull's-eye, and it has just as many detractors as admirers, but it's impossible not to appreciate Soderbergh's conviction that making a film out on the fringes is a worthy endeavor.--Tom Keogh", "price": 19.98, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 581785}, "asin": "1572521481", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RK6ZGMACL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Schizopolis [VHS]"}
{"description": "Fran&ccedil;ois Truffaut's third feature, though it's named for the two  best friends who become virtually inseparable in pre-World War&nbsp;I Paris, is  centered on Jeanne Moreau's Catherine, the most mysterious, enigmatic woman in his career-long gallery of rich female portraits. Adapted from the novel by Henri-Pierre Roch&eacute;, Truffaut's picture explores the 30-year friendship between Austrian biologist Jules (Oskar Werner) and Parisian writer Jim (Henri Serre) and the love triangle formed when the alluring Catherine makes the duo a trio. Spontaneous and lively, a woman of intense but dynamic emotions, she becomes the axle on which their friendship turns as Jules woos her and they marry, only to find that no one man can hold her. Directed in bursts of concentrated scenes interspersed with montage sequences and pulled together by the commentary of an omniscient narrator, Truffaut layers his tragic drama with a wealth of detail. He draws on his bag of New Wave tricks for the carefree days of youth--zooms, flash cuts, freeze frames--that disappear as the marriage disintegrates during the gloom of the postwar years. Werner is excellent as Jules, a vibrant young man whose slow, melancholy slide into emotional compromise is charted in his increasingly sad eyes and resigned face, while Serre plays Jim as more of an enigma, guarded and introspective. But both are eclipsed in the glare of Moreau's radiant Catherine: impulsive, demanding, sensual, passionate, destructive, and ultimately unknowable. A masterpiece of the French New Wave and one of Truffaut's most confident and accomplished films.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["1572524448"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 485144}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.97, "brand": "", "asin": "1572525851", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51NEMNZZ25L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Jules and Jim [VHS]"}

With its darkly disturbing La Femme Nikita-style story line, this film begs to be more than the 45-minute event that it is, rivaling the live-action works of Luc Besson and even John Woo. The story involves a college student, Sawa, whose family was brutally murdered. Sawa is adopted by Mr. Akai, the police detective investigating the case, and a twist occurs when we find that Mr. Akai has trained and utilized Sawa as an assassinating angel of vengeance to eliminate the undesirables able to slip through the net of the legal system. In the undertaking of one of these missions, Sawa meets Oburi, another orphan trained like her for the same purpose, and she is placed in the classic position of having to make a life-changing decision. Insights into the truth about Sawa's past are revealed through abstract flashbacks as the film progresses at maniacally breakneck speed, with intense gun battles and blood and guts galore.Kiteis exquisitely animated by Yasuomi Umetsu and accompanied by a hauntingly beautiful soundtrack composed by An Fu, and the only flaw is that it could have been expanded by exploring more of its profound emotional revelations.--Hector V.

When he was murdered in his own home - the killer delivered three fatal blows on his body - all evidence points to KHAM (Tony Jaa), who was present at the crime scene and was seen with the victim the moment before he died. Kham is forced to run as the police launch a pursuit. Meanwhile, the twin nieces of Boss Suchart (Jija Yanin Wismitanan and Teerada Kittisiriprasert) are out for revenge. But luck is on Kham's side when he runs into Sergeant MARK (Mum Jokmok), an Interpol agent sent to Thailand on a secret mission. As Kham is hunted by several parties, he's also desperately searching for KHON, his elephant, whose disappearance is involved with Boss Suchart's death. In another twist, Kham is drawn into an underground fighting ring run by LC (RZA), a crime lord who's obsessed with collecting top-class martial artists from around the world. LC's fighters are branded only by numbers, such as the lethal, beautiful TWENTY (Ratha Pho-ngam)  and the diabolical NO.2 (Marrese Crump). These fighters are ordered to defeat and capture Kham for a special mission that LC has in mind.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00HSJ2EMI", "B00GXFZOYI", "B00J5LXST0", "B00K2LC44M", "B000I0RNWU", "B00IS402HQ", "B00J5LXTUI", "B00ITAQ11U", "B00GHH9HP4", "B00HSJ2BEE", "B00GXG16BC", "B00B361IE2", "B00FEHCQEC", "B00G3HOJZ6", "B00FLCYIAA", "B00FLD7CR0", "B00GWJIDLG", "B00GXGLQOO", "B00ATXIJOC", "B00HRYH6NQ", "B00HVFA322", "B00FRILRRK", "B004BZ5ADW", "B00G3HOLV8", "B00ITAQ3ZY", "B00HXEWGWQ", "B00FRILRSY", "B0085A9J18", "B00K2CHX9C", "B002XTXGA2", "B00JU949TK", "B00B6OEE7O", "B00INCBASS", "B00ET2ODYY", "B00L29MR4A", "B0009VBTQY", "B00K90LXKM", "B00J2MPZQG", "B002DHACS8", "B00K2CHWYI", "B00HI9QDXO", "B0031L5CTO", "B00IXD2N3I", "B004326EV0", "B00L4K3MLE", "B00B4MMVVY", "B00HRYH52I", "B00H47IWES", "B00E3G1G46", "B00KNVF2SG", "B001L67A4G", "B00BJ60KJA", "B00IIPL11Q", "B003LN0NXC", "B00KBZZI10", "B00K2CHVSK", "B00HSJ2AMW", "B009VL2A5M", "B00IIPL1JS", "B005F96UHI", "B00ENTX7JU", "B00JU94ZPS", "B00KPYT9PS", "B00FEHCQYW", "B00ITAQ49O", "B005ZMBEXU", "B00CEU4802", "B00H47IXJW", "B00HVFA37C", "B00ET2ODX0", "B00C3ALL9O", "B003Q7B79M", "B00J2MQ06U", "B00IKM5OCO", "B00K7IPGS6", "B00HUTPKJK", "B0056OZI0W", "B00EI3XAZC", "B000EE3FUY", "B005F96UGO", "B004H2CXBQ", "B00HNR3Z28", "B00FJX96BC", "B005M9VSLE", "B00JL6L4WC", "B00BEJL6Q8", "B00AN5LCOA", "B00BYYWAHM", "B00B4MMPA6", "B0013D8LCM", "B00HVA3F0E", "B00HUQC20I", "B001L67A3M", "B00CG0YLS4", "B00ATXIGWM", "B0099KJFJ4", "B008XEZXZC", "B00CDSILIA", "B00JPFTSD6"], "bought_together": ["B00HSJ2EMI", "B00GXFZOYI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00J5LXST0", "B0085A9J18", "B000I0RNWU", "B00HSJ2EMI"]}, "price": 15.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 58109}, "asin": "3918810143", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ZnSXXYXzL.jpg", "title": "Tom Yum Goong 2"}

Although many of thevery'70s trappings presented here may ultimately be too dated to be taken seriously (including a very self-indulgent jazz number and a hilariously gooey seduction number between Eastwood and Donna Mills), the core premise of infatuation taken out of bounds remains uncomfortably plausible--and was influential enough to be appropriated by one of the biggest hits of the '80s. (Here's a hint--it starred Michael Douglas, Glenn Close, and a very unfortunate bunny rabbit). A well-staged and occasionally very frightening thriller worth watching for Jessica Walter's peerlessly unhinged performance alone.

{"description": "This is the TV movie that put Steven Spielberg on the map, shortly before he madeThe Sugarland Express. Working from a script by Richard Matheson, the film stars Dennis Weaver as a mild-mannered traveling salesman who unintentionally angers the driver of a semi truck. Suddenly, the truck is not only riding his tail but trying to run him off the road. No matter what he does (pulling over, stopping at a diner, calling the cops), he can't get rid of it. Spielberg makes the wise decision of never showing the driver, even as he cranks the voltage on the film's suspense elements. As a result, the truck itself takes on an air of satanic menace--even a personality of sorts--as it seems to hunt its human prey. Spielberg made a lot out of a little, suggesting just how skilled a storyteller he would become.--Marshall Fine", "related": {"also_bought": ["0764006770", "B0013527K2", "630197705X", "0792835077", "630180550X", "6301976061", "0792846443", "B00AEFXX9Q", "6305123616", "6300214060", "B004IB04NK", "6300213838", "6303471552", "6302890721", "6303148352", "B0000068EE", "6301969413", "6304071876", "6302038308", "0790733897", "0790734079", "6302516919", "6300213900", "6300181340", "0783231482", "6300181286", "0783235607", "6304005512"], "bought_together": ["B0013527K2"], "also_viewed": ["B0013527K2"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 250761}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 19.88, "brand": "", "asin": "6300181987", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51FN746KT0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Duel [VHS]"}

{"description": "The debut film of director Joel Coen and his brother-producer Ethan Coen, 1983'sBlood Simpleis grisly comic noir that marries the feverish toughness of pulp thrillers with the ghoulishness of even pulpier horror. (Imagine the novels of Jim Thompson somehow fused with the comic tabloidWeird Tales, and you get the idea.) The story concerns a Texas bar owner (Dan Hedaya) who hires a seedy private detective (M. Emmett Walsh) to follow his cheating wife (Frances McDormand in her first film appearance), and then kill her and her lover (John Getz). The gumshoe turns the tables on his client, and suddenly a bad situation gets much, much worse, with some violent goings-on that are as elemental as they are shocking. (A scene in which a character who has been buried alive suddenly emerges from his own grave instantly becomes an archetypal nightmare.) Shot by Barry Sonnenfeld before he became an A-list director in Hollywood,Blood Simpleestablished the hyperreal look and feel of the Coens' productions (undoubtedly inspired a bit by filmmaker Sam Raimi, whoseThe Evil Deadhad just been coedited by Joel). Sections of the film have proved to be an endurance test for art-house movie fans, particularly an extended climax that involves one shock after another but ends with a laugh at the absurdity of criminal ambition.

Released in 1973, between the first twoGodfathermovies, this is the true story of Frank Serpico, a long-haired, idealistic, iconoclastic cop who reluctantly goes undercover to investigate dirty colleagues who are on the take. This is one of the definitive Pacino performances, along with his role as Michael Corleone in theGodfathersaga, and Sonny the bungling bank robber inDog Day Afternoon(which reunited him with his Serpico director, Sidney Lumet)--and Pacino was nominated for a best actor Oscar for all of them (although he wouldn't actually win until 1992'sScent of a Woman).--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["0790733927", "6301798503", "630018627X", "0790734079", "630300394X", "6300181405", "6304935811", "6302289017", "0783222955"], "bought_together": ["0790733927"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 281672}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.79, "brand": "", "asin": "6300216543", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/210TZHT56VL.jpg", "title": "Serpico [VHS]"}

Directed by Joshua Logan from George Axelrod's script of Inge's Broadway hit, the film stars Marilyn Monroe as the kind of woman who can't understand why she always brings out the worst in men. A singer who has attracted the attention of a young rodeo rider (Don Murray) whom she meets on a bus, she finds herself trapped at a bus stop in the middle of nowhere during a blizzard. The young cowboy, whose intentions are honorable, can't control his temper and can't understand why this experienced woman won't take him seriously--and why she rejects him when he begins acting jealous and possessive.

{"description": "The prestigious filmmaking trio of producer Ismail Merchant, director James Ivory, and screenwriter Ruth Prawer Jhabvala had made other critically acclaimed films beforeA Room with a Viewwas released in 1985, but it was this popular film that made them art-house superstars. Splendidly adapted from the novel by E.M. Forster, it's a comedy of the heart, a passionate romance and a study of repression within the British class system of manners and mores. It's that system of rigid behavior that prevents young Lucy Honeychurch (Helena Bonham Carter) from accepting the loving advances of a free-spirited suitor (Julian Sands), who fears that she will follow through with her engagement to a priggish intellectual (Daniel Day-Lewis) whose capacity for passion is virtually nonexistent. During and after a trip to Italy with her protective companion (Maggie Smith), Lucy gradually gets in touch with her true emotions. The fun of watchingA Room with a Viewcomes from seeing how Lucy's thoughts and feelings finally arrive at the same romantic conclusion. Through an abundance of humor both subtle and overt, this crowd-pleasing \"art movie\" rose to an unexpected level of popular appeal. The Merchant-Ivory team received eight Academy Award nominations for their efforts, and won the Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay, Art Direction, and Costume Design.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000048PO", "B00003CXC9", "6302728657", "6303052223", "6301965817"], "bought_together": ["B0000048PO", "B00003CXC9"], "also_viewed": ["B004SIP7D0", "B0015LPRSI"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 195581}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 23.98, "brand": "", "asin": "6300250512", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/417J0G7GBCL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "A Room With a View [VHS]"}

Completing the triangle is Albert Brooks, who provides contrast as the gifted reporter with almost no presence on camera. He carries a torch for Hunter; she sees merely a friend. Written and directed by James L. Brooks, this shows remarkable insight into the people who make television. On the surface it is about that love triangle. If you look a little deeper, however, you will see that this behind-the-scenes comedy is a very revealing look at obsessive behavior and the heightened emotions that accompany adrenaline addiction. It is for good reason this was nominated for seven Academy Awards (though it did not win any). There are scenes in this movie you cannot shake, such as Hunter's scheduled mini-breakdowns, or Brooks's furious \"flop sweat\" during his tryout as a national anchor.

{"description": "Writer-director Preston Sturges's third feature, 1941'sSullivan's Travels, remains the antic auteur's most ambitious screen effort. Having added the producer's stripe to his duties, Sturges combines breezy romantic comedy, arch Hollywood satire, and social essay into a single, screwball story line.The titular pilgrim is John L. Sullivan (Joel McCrea), an Ivy League grad who's enjoyed a meteoric rise as the director behind escapist movies likeAnts in Your Pants of 1938, but is now determined to raise his sights toward more exalted, serious-minded cinematic art. His proposed breakthrough, portentously titledO Brother, Where Art Thou?, elicits a studio response closer to \"Oh, brother,\" given the director's utter lack of first-hand experience on the wrong side of the tracks.Instead of capitulating, Sullivan sets off disguised as a tramp, ready to meet life's crueler lessons face-to-face--albeit followed at a discreet distance by a motor home filled with studio handlers and reporters. His ludicrous odyssey may give the boy director no real insight, but it gives Sturges the chance to inject some reliably fine gags and a romantic subplot featuring the luminous Veronica Lake. It's at this juncture that Sturges the writer's darker objective throws a jolting shift in tone. Suffice it to say that just when a comic, upbeat denouement seems imminent, Sullivan travels instead from the sunlit California of the comedy's early reels toward a darker, relentlessly downbeat world influenced more by the social realism of the movies the hero desperately wants to make. By the final reel, Sturges has flirted with real tragedy, turning his conclusion into a meditation on his own seemingly carefree, dizzily comic art.--Sam Sutherland", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0001ZMXAY", "1558802010", "6300270068", "6301586034", "6300185125", "630196585X"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 282671}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6301232291", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41QKDMDZGKL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Sullivan's Travels [VHS]"}

{"description": "When Sean Connery abandoned the James Bond series to seek out new challenges, he turned to director John Boorman's sci-fi project, ZARDOZ. Connery stars as Zed, one of a carefully bred race of supervisors, the Exterminators, who oversee the agricultural labor of the neanderthal Brutals, since in 2293, with most of the Earth's surface off-limits as a polluted Outlands, industrial society has been abandoned. All worship Zardoz, a huge flying stone head who makes periodic visits to Earth to pick up grain consignments and issue bizarre statements involving the male anatomy through the voice of Arthur Frayn (Niall Buggy). An increasingly skeptical Zed decides to stow away inside the head, which deposits him in the Vortex, a commune of scientists and intellectuals who are ruled by the ever-youthful and asexual Eternals. They capture Zed, allowing geneticist May (Sara Kestleman) to use him as a research subject for a limited period, but he begins to arouse more than scientific curiosity in the commune's supposedly nonsexual female population.", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301801709"], "also_viewed": ["B00127IE0S"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 357031}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 15.11, "brand": "", "asin": "6301744128", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51M1VYRMB8L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Zardoz [VHS]"}

Heidi is an orphan, dumped into the Swiss Alps by self-centered Aunt Dete (Mady Christians) onto a grandfather she's never known, but they soon learn to love each other. Heidi's mercenary aunt returns and sells (!) Heidi to a cruel woman, appropriately named Fraulein Rottenmeier (Mary Nash). Adolf sets out on a quest to find his granddaughter. Meanwhile, Heidi charms Klara Sesemann (Marcia Mae Jones), the wealthy handicapped girl in Fraulein Rottenmeier's care. Look for a delightful Arthur Treacher as the Sesemann butler. There's a cute fantasy production number, \"In Our Little Wooden Shoes,\" featuring Temple in various period costumes. ThroughoutHeidi, Temple is, as always, wonderfully joyful.

{"description": "Hollywood's golden year of 1939 found the Marx BrothersAt the Circus, up to their usual mischief if not their usual standards. It's a lesser effort but still a rollicking good time, casting Groucho, Chico, and Harpo as the would-be saviors of a financially troubled circus. Of course, Groucho gets the lion's share of zingers as crackpot lawyer J. Cheever Loophole (especially when sparring with his quintessential straight-lady, Margaret Dumont), and Irving Brecher's zippy dialogue (with a last-minute polish by Ben Hecht) is custom fit to the Marxes' vaudeville roots. This was the Marxes' third movie for MGM, and the studio's insistence on sappy romantic subplots and a wimpy romantic lead (Kenny Baker) occasionally stalls the manic momentum. Fortunately there's ample compensation, including Groucho's signature performance of \"Lydia, the Tattooed Lady,\" penned byWizard of Ozsongwriters Harold Arlen and Yip Harburg. Despite the racial stereotypes that populate Harpo's jazzy interlude,At the Circusis a three-ring showcase of fun.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000009T77"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 385981}, "asin": "6301965981", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21D6WWKF17L.jpg", "title": "Marx Brothers At the Circus [VHS]"}
{"description": "This Ivan Passer movie--a marvel of dark, brooding cinema--almost didn't make it into theaters. The film was nearly dumped by its studio because its pessimistic story seemed too downbeat. Which, in fact, is part of the appeal: the way it gets to the heart of a group of people who have given up, but then find something that motivates them to go on. In this case, it's greed: Cutter (John Heard), a burnt-out gigolo, and his pal Bone (Jeff Bridges), a disfigured Vietnam veteran, get involved in a plot involving corruption and murder. Bone has proof that a powerful businessman is behind the killing and wants to be paid off to keep quiet; instead he buys them more trouble than he can imagine. Bridges, as always, is superb--and Heard is downright scary.--Marshall Fine", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 611203}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 10.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6301966368", "imUrl": "http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-site/icons/no-img-sm._CB192198896_.gif", "title": "Cutter's Way [VHS]"}

{"description": "A vicious alligator named Ramon, who was flushed into the city sewer as a baby, survives to become a 32-foot-long menace who devours animals and people alike. Screenplay by JOHN SAYLES. \"directed this sly horror-comedy from a script by John Sayles, which plays off the old urban legend about the dangers of flushing one's pet alligator down the toilet. One such unlucky reptile is \"Ramon,\" who survives in the subterranean cesspool by feeding on the steroid-saturated carcasses of dogs dumped there by chemical company researchers and eventually bulks up to the size of a Winnebago. When assorted sewage workers start disappearing into Ramon's massive maw, hard-boiled cop David Madison (Robert Forster), who has a history of unlucky partners, reveals a strong personal interest in the case. Deemed a jinx and a nutcase by his superiors, he's kicked off the force and must go underground (literally) to destroy the beast with the help of young reptile-expert Marion (Robin Riker). The witty screenplay is filled with clever references, eccentric characters and in-jokes aplenty (a style reflective of Joe Dante's Piranha and The Howling, both of which Sayles also scripted), which combines with decent effects and a good amount of suspense (particularly in the sewer scenes) to make this an entertaining romp overall. Highlights include Henry Silva's over-the-top performance as a misplaced big-game hunter who recruits urban \"native guides\" in his back-alley search for the elusive Ramon.\" ~ Cavett Binion, All Movie Guide.", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 425092}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "title": "Alligator [VHS] (1980)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B003TX8Q6K"]}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21VPKQCFK2L.jpg", "asin": "6302036720"}
{"description": "Sixteen years after Francis Ford Coppola won his second Oscar forThe Godfather II(his first was for the 1972Godfather), the director and star Al Pacino attempted to revive the concept one more time. Despite an elaborate plot that involves Michael Corleone seeking redemption through the Vatican while simultaneously preparing his nephew (Andy Garcia) to take over the Corleone family, the film fails to take shape as a truly meaningful experience in the way the preceding movies do. Still, Pacino is very moving as an elder Michael, filled with regret and trying hard to make amends with his wife (Diane Keaton) and grown children (one of whom is played, and not all that well, by the director's daughter, Sofia Coppola).--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["630021639X", "B000003KHS", "6300183211", "630018627X", "6300267830", "6303168507", "6303402070", "B0001VL30O", "B0000633ZP", "6301976983", "0790705141", "B000056BRF", "0783222955", "B00005B238", "079284517X", "0790732017", "1558808590", "6304508611", "6302561868", "6300247171", "6304844948"], "bought_together": ["630021639X", "B000003KHS"], "also_viewed": ["B000NTPDSW", "630021639X", "B000003KHS", "6302610702", "6300183211", "6301792734"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 295789}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6302158176", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41PJ1BB01BL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Godfather, Part III (Final Director's Cut) [VHS]"}

People will be able to see and hear what happened, as it happened.  Such a time will never come again.Ed Sullivan secured as many segments as negotiations would permit--three--and so these historic performances are preserved intact. And the  Maysles Brothers, American filmmakers of great distinction, secured the wondrous realities off-stage.The 83-minute film contains more than 13 performances, which have been visually restored to near perfection.  The tracks have been digitally remastered to produce a superb hi-fi sound.  Between performances, the viewer will join the Beatles in their limos, hotel rooms, and on their trip from New York to Washington, D.C., to Miami, Florida.If you were there, this is a fabulous journey back into a glorious time of youthful joy.

{"description": "William Friedkin's classicpolicierwas propelled to box-office glory, and a fistful of Oscars, in 1972 by its pedal-to-the-metal filmmaking and fashionably cynical attitude toward law enforcement. Gene Hackman's Popeye Doyle, a brutally pushy New York City narcotics detective, is a dauntless crime fighter and Vietnam-era \"pig,\" a reckless vulgarian whose antics get innocent people killed. Loosely based upon an actual investigation that led to what was then the biggest heroin seizure in U.S. history, the picture traces the efforts of Doyle and his partner (Roy Scheider) to close the pipeline pumping Middle Eastern smack into the States through the French port of Marseilles. (The actual French Connection cops, Eddie Egan and Sonny Grosso, make cameo appearances.) It was widely recognized at the time that Friedkin had lifted a lot of his high-strung technique from the Costa-Gavras thrillersThe Sleeping Car MurdersandZ--he even imported one of Costa-Gavras's favorite thugs, Marcel Bozzuffi, to play the Euro-trash hit man plugged by Doyle in an elevated train station. There was an impressive official sequel in 1975,French Connection II, directed by John Frankenheimer, which took Popeye to the south of France and got him hooked on horse. A couple of semi-official spinoffs followed,The Seven-Ups, which elevated Scheider to the leading role, andBadge 373, with Robert Duvall stepping in as the pugnacious flatfoot.--David Chute", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000003KDG", "6300214567", "6300216500", "0790738139", "6305261296", "630442972X", "630407185X", "0790734079", "0790733897", "0790743531", "1558807780", "630321245X", "6300247384", "6301965701", "0792837916", "0800100832", "6304429274", "6300181340", "6300213900", "6302799163", "6303212263", "6302909023", "B00008R9K9", "B000007PI9", "0766202771", "B00005A1VH"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 82875}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6302238331", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51K7T6QP3QL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The French Connection [VHS]"}

{"description": "EDITOR'S NOTE: According to a Warner Home Video technician involved in  the production ofThe Stanley Kubrick Collection, Kubrick authorized all aspects of theCollection, from the use of Digital Component Video (or \"D-1\") masters originally approved in 1989, to the use of minimalist screen menus, chapter stops, and (in the case of2001: A Space OdysseyandThe Shiningon DVD) supplementary materials. Full-screen presentation ofThe ShiningandFull Metal Jacketwas also approved by Kubrick, who recomposed his original framing,  reportedly believing that those films looked best on video in the full-screen format. (In fact, the original theatrical aspect ratio ofThe Shiningwas 1.66:1, meaning that a relatively small portion of the image is lost.) Kubrick also chose mono over stereo,  believing that inconsistencies in theatrical sound systems resulted in loss of control over theatrical presentation. In every respect, the Warner spokesman  said, the films in theCollectionremain as Kubrick approved them. Any future attempt to remaster or alter them would  have to be approved by an appointee of the Kubrick estate.", "related": {"also_bought": ["0790705141", "0792839846", "6303402070", "0783221347", "0790731975", "0784011923", "6300182916", "6300216047", "0792842464", "6302360978", "6300185281", "6302054982", "6302120101", "B00005ATQA", "6305237115", "0790734079", "B001BZQMFA", "6300184110", "6300183416", "B00000J2L7", "B00000FZCU", "6300216500", "B000AMW2TK", "6301564456", "6300247171", "B00000JGEK", "630442972X", "B00005B238", "0790758474", "0790733927", "6303953425", "0783217528", "0792845684", "B00004W5UA", "0767825411", "6304429274", "6300183092", "6305363668", "0790734877", "B00000JRUB", "0783235607"], "bought_together": ["0790705141"], "also_viewed": ["B001993Y1S", "B008M4MB8K", "B00337QJO8", "B00GGAK0FS", "B00108E1GU", "B006JVPK2M", "6302610702", "B008MILL8C", "6300214826", "B001AQO3QA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 369746}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6302760046", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514N60SRJ4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]"}

He reedited it, cutting eight minutes in hopes of getting the story (written by William Goodhart) to the point of coherency, to no avail. The film remains a kind of reverse gold standard for sequels.

Cary Elwes is Robin (with a lighthearted jab at Kevin Costner's bad English accent inRobin Hood: Prince of Thieves), while Richard Lewis plays an angst-ridden King John, and Roger Rees a snotty Sheriff of Nottingham. Comic David Chappelle has some good moments as the only black member of Robins's noble thieves, and Brooks does his own spin on Friar Tuck: Rabbi Tuchman. The song-and-dance sequences featuring a chorus line of the Merry Men (\"We're men / men in tights\") is vintage Brooks, but otherwise the film can't get any traction.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["630281622X", "6304466498", "6305576173", "B0002F6BQU", "6302820448"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 304035}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6302946387", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51824MFGAXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Robin Hood - Men in Tights [VHS]"}
{"description": "Consistently cited by critics worldwide as one of the greatest films ever made, Jean Renoir's bittersweet drama of life, love, class, and the social code of manners and behavior (\"the rules of the game\") is a savage critique undertaken with sensitivity and compassion. Renoir's catch-phrase through the film, \"Everyone has their reasons,\" develops a multilayered meaning by the conclusion. A young aviator (Roland Toutain) commits a serious social faux pas by alluding to an affair on national radio. To avert a scandal, the cultured Robert de la Chesnaye (Marcel Dalio), husband to the aviator's mistress, Christine (Nora Gregor), and a philanderer in his own right, invites all to a weekend hunting party in his country mansion. The complicated maze of marriages and mistresses (social register and servant class alike) is plotted like a bedroom farce, but the tone soon takes a darker cast. Renoir, who also takes the pivotal role as Andre's jovial pal and de la Chesnaye confidant Octave, deftly blends high comedy with cutting satire as he parallels the upstairs-downstairs affairs. The film builds to a comic pitch with the hilarious performance of Julien Carette as a rabbit poacher turned groundskeeper, but soon turns tragic in a devastating conclusion. The film was roundly condemned and banned in France upon its 1939 release, but years later (out of the shadow of WWII) the film was rediscovered for the masterpiece that it is.--Sean Axmaker", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 412283}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "title": "The Rules of the Game [VHS]", "related": {"also_bought": ["6304628188"]}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51JT64E0AAL._SY300_.jpg", "asin": "6302969301"}

Granted, the laughs are often cheap and silly, but there's no one who can embody a comic character and riff within that character the way Myers does. Wayne and his pal Garth (Dana Carvey) were fixtures onSaturday Night Livebefore the unexpected success ofWayne's World, which is about what happened when they tried to take their local cable-access show citywide. This time, they want to stage Waynestock, a mammoth rock festival in their little Chicago suburb, even as Wayne copes with girlfriend Tia Carrere's interest in record-company exec Christopher Walken. For extra fun, Garth gets involved with the babelicious Kim Basinger.

{"description": "For those who never thought Disney would release a film in which Santa Claus is kidnapped and tortured, well, here it is!  The full title isTim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas, which should give you an idea of the tone of this stop-action animated musical/fantasy/horror/comedy.  It is based on characters created by Burton, the former Disney animator best known as the director ofPee-wee's Big Adventure,Beetlejuice,Edward Scissorhands, and the first twoBatmanmovies. His benignly scary-funny sensibility dominates the story of Halloweentown resident Jack Skellington (voice by Danny Elfman, who also wrote the songs), who stumbles on a bizarre and fascinating alternative universe called ... Christmastown!  Directed by Henry Selick (who later made the delightfulJames and the Giant Peach), this PG-rated picture has a reassuringly light touch.  As Roger Ebert noted in his review, &quot;some of the Halloween creatures might be a tad scary for smaller children, but this is the kind of movie older kids will eat up; it has the kind of offbeat, subversive energy that tells them wonderful things are likely to happen.&quot;--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["0788812408", "6302526574", "6300274268", "B000C3L27U", "6300274195", "155890641X", "0788812807", "6304290888", "6304401132", "B00005JKDQ", "6304500831", "0788802194", "6303314015", "6302787068", "6304089767", "6304155972", "B00003CX7L", "6302642248", "B00000ICHA", "6305229449", "0788803743", "6304978286", "6302320402", "6305326940", "6305319138", "B0000AQZYM", "0788806270", "6302178924", "B00005K9OA", "6302968143", "B000035Z2S", "6303983812", "6304400551", "6304501153", "6302961572", "6302794331", "B00005JL95", "B00003CWPW", "B00004R99N", "1558906150", "B00003CXQX", "0788805843", "B003UAKE9Y", "6305940932", "B000035Z46", "B00005JKX3", "0788805533", "6304100507", "6303232221", "6303018343", "078881172X", "6304492960", "6303534422", "6304492979", "B00000JS61", "6304492952", "6304293968", "6302426200", "B0000524CZ", "6300274608", "6301991311", "6302642493", "B00000J2JA", "B00007AJLB", "B00005LL26", "6301948106", "6301390725", "6304873441", "B00006953H", "6304089627", "0788812181", "B00005RDVV", "6300275310", "0788810448", "B00005JLR1", "B00005T7H1", "B000063V14", "6300276554", "B000009CTR", "6304089201", "0790742322", "0788811002", "B00003CXHR", "6303442447", "6304400225", "B0002YLCHE", "6305310068", "B008OGW5XC", "B000063V8N", "1423178696", "B00000JYLP", "B00003CXJ3", "B00029LO18", "B002VDBRIS", "6303929338", "6303315305", "6304416415", "078880782X", "B000IFRQHC"], "bought_together": ["B000C3L27U"], "also_viewed": ["6303314015", "0788812408", "6304089767", "6302526574", "6304290888", "6305229449", "6302158095", "0788805843", "078881172X", "6302178924", "B00003CXQX", "6304155972", "6302968143", "0788802194", "B000035Z2S", "6303983812", "155890641X", "6304978286", "6302794331", "6300274268", "6303036813", "6300275310", "B00005JL95", "B000C3L27U", "6303534422", "6302320402", "B003L4Y5BW", "6304500831", "0788805533", "6303939015", "6305940932", "6302787068", "B00005RDVV", "6302426200", "6301404440", "B00005JKDQ", "0788812807", "B00004R99N", "6303929338", "B000009CTR", "B00003CX7L", "6302484359", "6305326940", "0788812181", "B000035Z46", "6301991311", "6303168957", "6303925235", "6305319138", "0788806270", "6304416415", "6304400381", "6304089201", "B00000F8J1", "0788811002", "6304400225", "B0034GK74G", "B00016JF2W", "6300274195"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 144750}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.0, "brand": "", "asin": "6303122647", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510VC795MQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]"}

{"description": "Woody Allen combined the best parts of his earlier films in creating HANNAH AND HER SISTERS, his 1986 masterwork about the changing relationships among three sisters living in New York City. Hannah (Mia Farrow) has put her acting career aside in order to take care of her family with second husband Elliot (Michael Caine in an Oscar-winning performance). Elliot has fallen in love with Hannah's sister Lee (Barbara Hershey), who herself is feeling suffocated by her cynical, mean-spirited loner of a lover, played with great intensity by Ingmar Bergman regular Max von Sydow. Meanwhile, third sister Holly (Oscar winnner Dianne Wiest) is struggling to find her own voice, working as a caterer while she tries to get her own acting career going. And in the middle of everything is Mickey (Woody Allen at his most neurotic), a television writer who is divorced from Hannah, has dated Holly, and, when he suspects he might have a brain tumor, decides to re-evaluate his life and his faith in God. HANNAH AND HER SISTERS is Allen's most fully realized, optimistic adult comedy. He won a well-deserved Oscar for his marvelous screenplay, filled with his trademark sharp, witty dialogue, his undying passion for New York (its culture, architecture, music, romance), and some of his most well-developed characters. The cast is extraordinary, the music illuminating, the settings magnificent. Taking place over the course of a few Thanksgivings, Allen's insightful, wonderful film is a thoroughly enjoyable mature look at the trials, tribulations, and triumphs of family life.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005AUJL", "6301963911", "6301964365", "6304039166", "630146494X", "6300216365", "6301972147", "6301971922", "630228175X", "6302718910", "0800102371", "6303430546", "6303011411", "B0000068DV", "6302697042", "6300251012"]}, "price": 13.31, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 442883}, "asin": "6303232663", "imUrl": "http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-site/icons/no-img-sm._CB192198896_.gif", "title": "Hannah &amp; Her Sisters [VHS]"}
{"description": "When a Man Loves a Womanis a dumb title (notanotherclassic pop song, please) for a very smart movie. A kind of gender-switch take onThe Lost Weekend, it's about a woman (Meg Ryan) whose alcoholism almost destroys her family. That may sound like just another TV movie, butWhen a Man Loves a Womanis so authentic in detail and emotion, that everything about it seems fresh, urgent, and engrossing. That's because the film is grounded in the actual experience of co-writer Al Franken (assisted byRain Manscripter Ronald Bass). Franken is best known for his affiliation withSaturday Night LiveandPolitically Incorrect, and as the author ofRush Limbaugh Is a Big Fat Idiot, and Other Observations. You may recall that Franken is the creator of Stuart Smalley, 12-step programmer extraordinaire. Well, if you want to know how Stuart was born, you can start here. This is no comedy, however. In fact, one of the most painful realizations comes when attractive, \"good-time girl\" Alice Green (Ryan) and her husband (Andy Garcia) begin to realize how much of a role alcohol played in their marriage and in bringing them together in the first place.

They arrive on a desert world with cultural (and apparently supernatural) ties to Earth's ancient Egypt, where the sun god Ra (played by Jaye Davidson fromThe Crying Game) rules a population of slaves with armored minions and startlingly advanced technology. After being warmly welcomed into the slave camp, the earthlings encourage and support a rebellion, and while Russell threatens to blow up the Stargate to prevent its use by enemy forces, the movie collapses into a senseless series of action scenes and grandiose explosions. It's all pretty ridiculous, butStargatefound a large and appreciative audience, spawned a cable-TV series, and continues to attract science fiction fans who are more than willing to forgive its considerable faults.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303257844", "6300214540", "6303012140", "6303909884", "6303269834", "6302256615", "B000005QWI", "B00000K2SC"], "also_viewed": ["6303421563", "B000TJBNHQ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 399576}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6303398480", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41EN0CBJJ8L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Stargate [VHS]"}

{"description": "The movie that heralded the French New Wave movement, this lean and exciting 1959 film directed by Jean-Luc Godard (A Woman Is a Woman,Weekend) broke new ground not only in its unorthodox use of editing and hand-held photography, but in its unflinching and nonjudgmental portrayal of amoral youth. Jean-Paul Belmondo and Jean Seberg play two young lovers on the run from the law after Belmondo kills a cop and steals a car. Soon they are on an odyssey through the streets of Paris searching for some money he is owed so that he and his American girlfriend can escape to Italy. As a chase picture it features some startling photography on the streets of Paris, but as a romance it defies expectations, existing as part tragedy and partBonnie and Clydecrime movie. The result is a wholly original film experience.

{"description": "For those who considerBulworthto be a savage and unprecedented political send-up, it's worth revisiting Warren Beatty's first, and best, attempt at outrageous social criticism. Mercilessly exposing the essential vacuity of both the sexual revolution and conservative alarmism over cultural permissiveness,Shampooremains the best movie ever made about Nixon's America, and one of the very best about the tragic and disappointing conclusion to the 1960s. Set on the eve of the 1968 presidential election that elevated Nixon to the Oval Office, Beatty's uproarious satire follows a hairdressing Lothario (played by Mr. You're So Vain himself) in and out of the beds of several women, including the wife of a wealthy businessman, his mistress, and his young daughter (Carrie Fisher, in her first screen role). Juxtaposing tropes from Restoration comedy with Southern California dialogue and a healthy, hilarious dash of running commentary from election returns, Beatty's ruthlessawarenesscuts through the film like a scalpel. The performances are uniformly excellent and surprisingly ego-free; though Jack Warden's portrayal of Lester, the twice-cuckolded businessman, stands out as a model of sensitive, nuanced parodic acting. Released in 1975 during the messy cleanup at the conclusion of the Watergate era,Shampooneatly bookends the Nixon presidency, and concludes with the frightening finality of an iron door slamming on a cell. Commended for including the live version of Jefferson Airplane'sPlastic Fantastic Lover.--Miles Bethany", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0001GL3KE", "6301885732", "080013222X"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 226674}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 16.88, "brand": "", "asin": "6303686834", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZZ7MFF8RL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Shampoo [VHS]"}
{"description": "Carol White (Julianne Moore) is a mousy housewife living the affluent life in the San Fernando Valley when, over the span of a few months, she begins to develop debilitating sensitivities to her environment. A permanent at the hair salon makes her nose bleed and her skin go bad, exhaust from a truck causes her to cough violently, she's allergic to the new couch, goes into seizures at the dry cleaner's. No one understands or credits her condition, least of all her husband or family physician. But the symptoms worsen, and Carol eventually discovers others who suffer from similar environmental illnesses. She checks into a desert spa that caters to those in her predicament, and the staff regales her with touchy-feely,  infomercial-style affirmations. All of this could have been broad satire, but  director Todd Haynes (Velvet Goldmine) opts for a filming style that captures the empty elegance of Carol's passive lifestyle and looks on with clinical dispassion, so that you can hear the oppressive quiet surrounding her. It's positively eerie, so you know you're not watching just a worthy cause picture or movie of the week. Haynes has more ambition than that, even going so far as to insert a slight buzzing sound in the soundtrack to accentuate the unease. Fluorescent lights? Power lines? Who knows? Maybe it's safe to call it the ominous rumblings beneath the surface of Carol's life, from antiseptic affluence to septic isolation in the spa environment. A model of sustained tone, boasting one of the most remarkable performances by Julianne Moore, from a whole career of remarkable performances.--Jim Gay", "price": 38.89, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 404821}, "asin": "6303900798", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Q8JHZ2CXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Safe [VHS]"}

{"description": "Director Stanley Kramer's socially conscious 1961 film tackles the subject of the war crime trials arising out of World War II in an earnest and straightforward fashion, exploring the consciousness of two nations as they struggle to come to terms with the aftermath of the Holocaust. Spencer Tracy plays the American judge selected to head the tribunal that will try the suspected war criminals. As he sets about his task, he must confront the raw emotion felt by the German people, and his own notions of good and evil, right and wrong. Regarded as a classic, this stark rendering of one of the most pivotal events in the 20th century features a stellar cast including Burt Lancaster, Montgomery Clift, Marlene Dietrich, a young William Shatner, and Maximillian Schell, who won an Oscar for his role as counsel for the defense for those charged with crimes against humanity.Judgment at Nurembergis important viewing not only for the history of film, but for the history of modern times.--Robert Lane", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300215644", "B000FE5MR2", "6302413435", "6302120624", "630549388X", "0767825616", "6301661850", "0782008348", "B00005LCBP", "6304005989", "B000006GCU", "6304457391"], "also_viewed": ["B00000FZ8B", "B00000F4X2", "B00KCY3XDK", "B00005B6OY", "B00006349J", "B003LMPKSQ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 264992}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 39.88, "brand": "", "asin": "630396155X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51X8BB15R5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Judgment at Nuremberg [VHS]"}

{"description": "Whit Stillman (Barcelona,Last Days of Disco) enters Woody Allen territory in his talky yet articulate debut, creating a stinging expos&eacute; of self-important upper-class socialites and the head games they play, during their Christmas vacation in Manhattan. Witty and cynical, Stillman captures this odd subculture with sly observation and occasional sympathy--sort of a fascinating anthropological study of adolescent preppies. His young subjects, spoiled by their silver spoons, still lack life experience and, thus, emotional maturity or social grace. They pass time idly discussing Jane Austen (a tip of the hat to the master of social-manner comedies), Marxism, and other philosophies, dressing up for parties and undressing during strip poker, and gossiping about the romantic pairings for the upcoming debutante ball. Stillman smartly offers up Tom (Edward Clements), a middle-class loner who's slowly adopted into the clique, as an audience identification reference, making the events seem even stranger and funnier from his point of view. But Tom's far from perfect himself. As the innocent, easily manipulated Audrey (Carolyn Farina) begins to fall in love with him, Tom's boorish, hurtful responses make him appear as juvenile as the rest. Concurrently, it also jolts the group with a much-needed taste of reality, and the film with unpredictable poignancy, suggesting that at least one may grow from the experience. In his first opportunity as director, Stillman pulls wonderful performances from his unknown cast. Especially memorable are Christopher Eigeman as the sarcastically perceptive snob, Nick, and Taylor Nichols playing the philosophical, anxiety-ridden Charlie.--Dave McCoy", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305128960", "B0081FSMII", "0790731150"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 435874}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 15.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6303995713", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51G4G1JRARL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Metropolitan [VHS]"}

{"description": "Roald Dahl's modern classic for children becomes a delightful combination of live action and stop-motion animation by the team that madeThe Nightmare Before Christmas: director Henry Selick and producers Tim Burton (Batman) and Denise Di Novi. The story concerns young James (played for real and through voice-overs by Paul Terry), who is orphaned and left in the charge of two cruel aunts (Miriam Margolyes, Joanna Lumley). Rescued by a mysterious fellow (Pete Postlethwaite), James ends up inside a giant peach, drifting over the Atlantic Ocean in the company of a gentleman grasshopper (voiced by Simon Callow), a fast-talking centipede (Richard Dreyfuss), an anxious earthworm (David Thewlis), a matronly ladybug (Jane Leeves), and a sexy spider (Susan Sarandon).

{"description": "Desperate for work, troubled high school teacher Jim Norman (Tim Matheson) relocates his family to his rural hometown after procuring a much-needed job there. Once home he must relive and confront a childhood nightmare:  the high school hoodlums who murdered his older brother in a tunnel ambush, and were killed themselves by an oncoming train, are slowly rising from the grave to finish the job by killing Norman.  The ghostly hooligans, who appear as flesh and blood to students, start \"transferring\" into school when some of Norman's students mysteriously perish; however their phantom, fire-spitting car is invisible to all but their victims.  Suspicion for the inexplicably rising student-body count soon falls squarely on Norman, who must find a way to protect his wife and son from danger, vanquish the supernatural hoods, and cast off the shackles of his past.  It's a fairly straightforward plot with some obvious elements, but Matheson and his supporting cast (including wife Brooke Adams) create a suspenseful, fear-inducing atmosphere under the able direction of Tom McLoughlin from a screenplay adaptation by Lawrence Konner and Mark Rosenthal.--Bryan Reesman", "related": {"also_bought": ["630413374X", "0783112572", "B0000C2IQQ", "1573626872", "6303153461", "6302814766", "B0001US7OA", "B0007WFXNA", "B0033HKCV4", "B0002A2VK0"], "bought_together": ["6303153461"], "also_viewed": ["0790736039", "1573625736", "B004QF71ZM"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 674840}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6304145462", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DDHEW5SDL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Sometimes They Come Back [VHS]"}
{"description": "Initially broadcast as a TV miniseries to go with the series of threeAnthologydouble-CD albums, this set of eight documentary tapes has the  heft and scope of one ofKen  Burns's expansive projects. Still, unless you are either a historian or a  truly committed fan, you'll find yourself with way more material--particularly  about the Beatles' early lives as lads in Liverpool--than you'll want to watch.  The documentary material is copious, including early performance films and  tapes, at the point before they found their true voices. The actual Beatlemania  years--beginning in 1963 and concluding in 1970--feature extensive performance  films, as well as home movies and archival material. The best parts, of course,  are the interviews with the Beatles themselves, who produced the entire thing.  Along with reworking two previously unreleased John Lennon tracks as \"new  Beatles songs,\" theAnthologyincludes some unseen Lennon interview tapes  so that his acerbic voice can be heard as well. This stands as a comprehensive  document of that heady period, the second coming of rock & roll, as the Beatles  took what Elvis had started and expanded upon it exponentially. The tapes give a  solid sense of the historical context and the way these four musicians changed  the world around them in the 1960s.--Marshall Fine", "related": {"also_bought": ["630382336X", "6301966376", "6303823351", "B00000JRUB", "6302213142", "6301229479"], "bought_together": ["630382336X"], "also_viewed": ["B002BSHWUU", "B003YNFYCO", "0780615018", "B000002TYX", "B000002TYZ", "630382336X", "B0006V97B6", "B0030ATZIA", "6303029086", "6305073694", "B0000542D2", "B007I8KXQ8"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 315554}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 35.95, "brand": "Apple Corps Ltd.", "asin": "630416923X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5135NX6248L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Beatles Anthology Collector's Set [VHS]"}

{"description": "A flashy, splashy summer-movie blockbuster that's fun and exciting without being mindless? That's the impossible mission accomplished by director Brian De Palma, star-coproducer Tom Cruise, and the crack team ofMission: Impossible. Based on the '60s TV show and an almost impenetrably complex (but nonetheless thrilling) original story by David Koepp (Jurassic Park) and Steven Zaillian (Schindler's List), with a screenplay by Koepp and Robert Towne (Chinatown,Shampoo),Mission: Impossiblebegins with veteran agent Jim Phelps (Jon Voight) and his expert crew embarking on a mission that goes horribly, horribly wrong. But nothing is what it seems. The nail-biting set piece--always a signature of director De Palma (Carrie,The Untouchables)--in which Cruise is lowered from the ceiling to retrieve information from a computer in a high-security vault--is an instant classic. But perhaps even more impressive, at least in retrospect, is a flashback sequence in which two characters attempt to reconstruct a series of events from multiple points of view. It's pretty daring and sophisticated stuff for a big-budget spy movie, but brains were always what put theMission: Impossibleteam ahead of the competition, anyway, no?--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B00FZM412Q", "B0044VB3CK", "B00016UX0K", "B005XUNG5I"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 370174}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.99, "brand": "", "asin": "630420065X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41CTTDNC5EL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Mission Impossible [VHS]"}

That same president, late in the film, personally flies a jet fighter to deliver a payload of missiles against an attack by extraterrestrials.Independence Dayis the kind of movie so giddy with its own outrageousness that one doesn't even blink at such howlers in the plot. Directed by Roland Emmerich,Independence Dayis a pastiche of conventions from flying-saucer movies from the 1940s and 1950s, replete with icky monsters and bizarre coincidences that create convenient shortcuts in the story. (Such as the way the girlfriend of one of the film's heroes--played by Will Smith--just happens to run across the president's injured wife, who are then both rescued by Smith's character who somehow runs across them in alien-ravaged Los Angeles County.)

{"description": "Sold into shipboard slavery by his wicked uncle, the newly orphaned David Balfour turns his misfortune into adventure in this Disney adaptation of the classic Robert Louis Stevenson novel. Before he can get back to the Scottish Lowlands to claim his birthright, the young man experiences mutiny, shipwreck, clan wars, trickery, illness, and bagpipe playing. Most of this is at the side of the high-spirited Highlander Alan Breck. The Stewart clan leader crashes into his prison ship, jumps aboard, and commandeers both the ship and the boy's life, tutoring him in the ways of subterfuge, battle, and loyalty. Despite the relatively heavy subject matter, the tone is light and the action swift. Add the gorgeous--and genuine--Celtic scenery, and it makes for a quickly passed 95 minutes.

{"description": "Romance at its most anti-romantic--that is the Billy Wilder stamp of genius, and this Best Picture Academy Award winner from 1960 is no exception. Set in a decidedly unsavory world of corporate climbing and philandering, the great filmmaker's trenchant, witty satire-melodrama takes the office politics of a corporation and plays them out in the apartment of lonely clerk C.C. Baxter (Jack Lemmon). By lending out his digs to the higher-ups for nightly extramarital flings with their secretaries, Baxter has managed to ascend the business ladder faster than even he imagined. The story turns even uglier, though, when Baxter's crush on the building's melancholy elevator operator (Shirley MacLaine) runs up against her long-standing affair with the big boss (a superbly smarmy Fred MacMurray). The situation comes to a head when she tries to commit suicide in Baxter's apartment. Not the happiest or cleanest of scenarios, and one that earned the famously caustic and cynically humored Wilder his share of outraged responses, but looking at it now, it is a funny, startlingly clear-eyed vision of urban emptiness and is unfailingly understanding of the crazy decisions our hearts sometimes make. Lemmon and MacLaine are ideally matched, and while everyone cites Wilder'sSome Like It Hotclosing line \"Nobody's perfect\" as his best, MacLaine's no-nonsense final words--\"Shut up and deal\"--are every bit as memorable. Wilder won three Oscars forThe Apartment, for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Screenplay (cowritten with longtime collaborator I.A.L. Diamond).--Robert Abele", "related": {"also_bought": ["1558807780", "6300216233", "6304039530", "0800113055", "6301607929", "6301973259", "6300183890", "6302226899", "6300183513", "6301973232", "6300268470", "6301670159", "6301798503", "6300215644", "630266232X", "6304039522", "0782008348", "0783236352", "B00000GJ2B", "6301670140", "0792108868", "630196912X", "0790743213", "B0000040EO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 362176}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.39, "brand": "", "asin": "6304308388", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51VQCSN36TL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Apartment [VHS]"}
{"description": "This Academy Award winner for Best Picture is a sweeping soap opera about the guests at the Grand Hotel. Several plots intertwine, but mostly it's about Stars! Stars! Stars! Greta Garbo, Joan Crawford, Wallace Beery, and both Barrymore brothers head up the cast. Garbo is luminous as Grusinskaya, the neurotic and famous-but-slipping dancer and, yes, she \"vonts to be alone.\" John Barrymore is a cat burglar with blue blood and a heart of gold, and Lionel Barrymore happily caroms off him as Mr. Kringelein, a dying man who wants to live out the time he has left with the rich. Joan Crawford is perhaps the biggest surprise of the movie: as Flaemmchen, a young career girl trying to decide between secretary and tart, she is uncharacteristically funny, vivacious, and downright bubbly. Along the way we discover that money, fame, and titles don't guarantee happiness, and being a jewel thief doesn't necessarily make you a bad person. The nicest touch is the hint that other, minor plots swirl around the edges of the film, suggesting that we've only seen a small chapter of the hotel's story.Grand Hotelis a great deal of fun and an excellent chance to see some famous faces in their prime.--Ali Davis", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301670140", "6300158683", "6300273210", "0792837967", "630266232X", "1558807780", "6301978536", "6302842263", "6301976983", "0792837371"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 560387}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.7, "brand": "", "asin": "6304308469", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51962X724BL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Grand Hotel [VHS]"}

{"description": "Akira Kurosawa's rousingSeven Samuraiwas a natural for an American remake--after all, the codes and conventions of ancient Japan and the Wild West (at least the mythical movie West) are not so very far apart. ThusThe Magnificent Seveneffortlessly turns samurai into cowboys (the same trick worked more than once: Kurosawa'sYojimbobecame Sergio Leone'sA Fistful of Dollars). The beleaguered denizens of a Mexican village, weary of attacks by banditos, hire seven gunslingers to repel the invaders once and for all. The gunmen are cool and capable, with most of the actors playing them just on the cusp of '60s stardom: Steve McQueen, James Coburn, Charles Bronson, Robert Vaughn. The man who brings these warriors together is Yul Brynner, the baddest bald man in the West. There's nothing especially stylish about the approach of veteran director John Sturges (The Great Escape), but the storytelling is clear and strong, and the charisma of the young guns fairly flies off the screen.

{"description": "A grandly entertaining, old-fashioned adventure based on the Rudyard Kipling short story,The Man Who Would Be Kingis the kind of rousing epic about which people said, even in 1975, &quot;Wow! They don't make 'em like that anymore!&quot; When director John Huston (The Maltese Falcon,The Treasure of the Sierra Madre,The African Queen) first started trying to make the film, with Gable and Bogart, the project was derailed by the latter's death. It was a few decades before Huston was able to finally realize his dream movie--and with an unimprovable cast. Sean Connery and Michael Caine are, respectively, Daniel Dravot and Peachy Carnahan, a pair of lovably roguish British soldiers who set out to make their fortunes by conning the priests of remote Kafiristan into making them kings. It's a rollicking tale, an epic satire of imperialism, and the good-natured repartee shared by Caine and Connery is pure gold. In today's screen adventures, humor is usually imposed on the material by a writer or director trying to make some kind of cleverly self-aware comment (&quot;Hey, we know it's a movie!&quot;), but that sort of jokiness can create so much ironic distance that it pushes the audience right out of the picture. Huston lets the humor emerge naturally from the characters, for whom we wind up caring more deeply than we ever expected.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["630197803X", "B000X825Z2", "6300262782", "6300146030", "0792835093", "0792835077", "B00004WZR1", "6303402070", "B000003KDG", "630407185X", "6301777476", "6300269043", "6302360978", "630238060X", "630442972X", "6302482712", "6301797906", "0766202771", "0780621956"], "bought_together": ["630197803X"], "also_viewed": ["B00IWULSTC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 382415}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6304457359", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51NAD1N44BL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Man Who Would Be King [VHS]"}

{"description": "This long-awaited adaptation of the Broadway musical, directed by Alan Parker (Fame,The Commitments), features Madonna in her award-winning performance as Eva Peron, the controversial and inspirational First Lady of Argentina, as well as the score from the long-running Andrew Lloyd Webber musical. The story of Peron's rise to power with her husband (Jonathan Pryce) is narrated in song by peasant insurrectionist Che (Antonio Banderas), as Evita's glamour, poise, and ultimate tragedy inspire a nation in the midst of political and social upheaval. The film is a powerful one, visually stunning and epic in its scope, and yet highly emotional in both the well-known songs and the performances. Pryce portrays a deeply flawed man, ruthless and yet devoted to his wife. Banderas is a swashbuckling figure, instilling passion in the heart of Eva Peron. And Madonna gives a strong and commanding performance as a woman who loves her husband and loves her people but must fight the stirring passion inside her. Featuring \"You Must Love Me,\" an Academy Award-winning song written for the film, Evita is vivid and powerful entertainment for people who love musicals for both stage and screen.--Robert Lane", "related": {"also_bought": ["6304178352", "0792837614", "B00008X5J3", "6300147983", "B00329TVQA", "6300270971", "6302250269", "6301628454"], "bought_together": ["0792837614"], "also_viewed": ["B000002NAK", "B000RPCK2E"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 48216}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.94, "brand": "", "asin": "6304504012", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/416MK7C4A6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Evita [VHS]"}
{"description": "In 1963, Billy Wilder'sIrma La Doucewas one of the biggest box-office hits of the year, grossing twice as much asThe Great EscapeandThe Birds. Yet this popular movie has been almost completely forgotten by film history, even to fans of Wilder or stars Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine (the same trio had made a masterpiece,The Apartment, three years earlier). It doesn't represent the best work of those legends, butIrmaprovides tart entertainment. At least some of the movie's popularity can be chalked up to its subject, which was pretty risqu&eacute; for the time: Lemmon plays a Paris policeman who falls in love with a prostitute (MacLaine). The script was adapted from a stage musical, but Wilder decided to cut the songs, instead developing the humor and romance into his own blend of bittersweet perversity; this Technicolor-fantasy Paris is kind of a dark cousin toGigi. Lemmon is in his prime period of hand-wringing self-doubt, and MacLaine is perfectly in tune with his rhythms, especially in scenes that add tenderness to the sometimes queasy mix of moods. Ironically--given the nixing of the songs--the film won its only Oscar for Andr&eacute; Previn's adaptation of the stage play's music into a wordless orchestral score.--Robert Horton", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 462429}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 10.78, "brand": "", "asin": "6304508484", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51W0JEGYB2L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Irma La Douce [VHS]"}

{"description": "One of the greatest screen biographies ever produced, this monumental film runs nearly three hours, won seven Academy Awards, and gave George C. Scott the greatest role of his career. It was released in 1970 when protest against the Vietnam War still raged at home and abroad, and many critics and moviegoers struggled to reconcile current events with the movie's glorification of Gen. George S. Patton as a crazy-brave genius of World War II.How could a movie so huge in scope and so fascinated by its subject be considered an anti-war film? The simple truth is that it's not--Patton is less about World War II than about the rise and fall of a man whose life was literally defined by war, and who felt lost and lonely without the grand-scale pursuit of an enemy. George C. Scott embodies his role so fully, so convincingly, that we can't help but be drawn to and fascinated by Patton as a man who is simultaneously bound for hell and glory. The film's opening monologue alone is a masterful display of acting and character analysis, and everything that follows is sheer brilliance on the part of Scott and director Franklin J. Schaffner.Filmed on an epic scale at literally dozens of European locations, Patton does not embrace war as a noble pursuit, nor does it deny the reality of war as a breeding ground for heroes. Through the awesome achievement of Scott's performance and the film's grand ambition, Patton shows all the complexities of a man who accepted his role in life and (like Scott) played it to the hilt.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303057225", "0800132009", "B0007TKNGA", "6304071876", "6302909023", "6301966317", "6300181472", "B000059HGY", "6300214826", "6300268748", "079213690X", "630407185X", "B00000K3AN", "6301797906", "6301115430", "079284646X", "0790701251", "0790752395", "6302529441", "0783221347", "B00000F13T", "6300216543", "B00006C7G9", "6304151306", "B00005LL26", "630018224X", "6301971809", "6301965817", "6300181340", "630442972X", "6300988473", "630105573X", "0783216084", "6301777867", "B00003CXTF", "B000003KDG", "6303020089", "6301969251", "B000003KHS", "B00004CNR5", "6301662954", "0784011923", "B00000FZCU", "6300215962", "0800100832", "1569942072", "B00003CXE6", "6300271846", "6300181154", "630274721X", "0790734079", "0764004638", "0800125762", "6302415853", "6301976622", "630018627X", "B00005A1VG", "B000007OY0", "B000068TSI", "B00005ATQA", "0800116917", "6300216802", "6303696813", "6300267830", "0790758474", "0792116887", "0783235607", "630197154X", "B00005Q4GY", "B0000048YO", "6302224330", "0800106032", "6303824358", "B000056BRF", "6304457278", "6300267938", "6300182304"], "bought_together": ["6303057225"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 219212}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.74, "brand": "", "asin": "6304935811", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/418V1BMMHEL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Patton [VHS]"}

{"description": "When viewed from a cranky perspective, this by-the-book David versus Goliath story doesn't offer any surprises, and it's a bit sad to watch director Francis Coppola (who also adapted John Grisham's bestseller) squandering his once-glorious talent on such conventional Hollywood fare. In a more charitable light, however, there's great pleasure to be found in Coppola's intelligent, no-nonsense handling of a plot that's every bit as involving as it is formulaic. Coppola also knows how to bring out the best in a stellar cast, and this is the movie (released in November 1997, just a few weeks beforeGood Will Hunting) that signaled Matt Damon's arrival as a major-league star. Damon plays Rudy Baylor, a young rookie lawyer in Memphis (location of many Grisham stories) who takes on a powerful insurance company (led by shark-like lawyer Jon Voight) by representing the family of a boy who was denied potentially life-saving treatment for leukemia. Rudy also comes to the rescue of an abused wife (Claire Danes) and learns the tricks of the legal trade from a seasoned paralegal (Danny DeVito) who sees Rudy as his ticket out of the sleaze-ball practice run by a shady lawyer (Mickey Rourke). There's no mystery about where this plot is going, but Coppola takes us there in high style with a sharp script, and Damon strikes just the right note of naivete and strategic intelligence. When Goliath inevitably falls, this courtroom David wins fair and square.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6304259131", "6302935148", "0790748169", "B00020HABA", "B00003CXTF", "6305622825", "6305718792", "6303269834", "0792133153", "0783221347", "B00007CVYA", "6303313345", "6300183211", "B00004WIDB", "0790701251", "6302945089", "B00000IO4G"], "bought_together": ["6304259131"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 362387}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.24, "brand": "", "asin": "6304925131", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51362Y4QKQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Rainmaker [VHS]"}

{"description": "Vittorio De Sica's remarkable 1947 drama of desperation and survival in Italy's devastating post-war depression earned a special Oscar for its affecting power. Shot in the streets and alleys of Rome, De Sica uses the real-life environment of contemporary life to frame his moving drama of a desperate father whose new job delivering cinema posters is threatened when a street thief steals his bicycle. Too poor to buy another, he and his son take to the streets in an impossible search for his bike. Cast with nonactors and filled with the real street life of Rome, this landmark film helped define the Italian neorealist approach with its mix of real life details, poetic imagery, and warm sentimentality. De Sica uses the wandering pair to witness the lives of everyday folks, but ultimately he paints a quiet, poignant portrait of father and son, played by nonprofessionals Lamberto Maggiorani and Enzo Staiola, whose understated performances carry the heart of the film. De Sica and scenarist Cesare Zavattini also collaborated onShoeshine,Miracle in Milan, andUmberto D, all classics in the neorealist vein, but none of which approach the simple poetry and quiet power achieved inThe Bicycle Thief.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["1572524448"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 492162}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 19.86, "brand": "", "asin": "6304963173", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/712GEZEYA3L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Bicycle Thief [VHS]"}

{"description": "An economic crisis brings unemployed Nada (Roddy Piper) to L.A. in search of work.  What he finds instead is that the ruling elite of the world are aliens in disguise, their aim being to keep humans in a state of mindless consumerism.  His discovery comes when he dons a pair of special sunglasses made by a resistance group and sees for the first time reality unadorned.  Billboards, store signs, magazine covers--all bear subliminal messages to OBEY, to CONSUME, to have NO INDEPENDENT THOUGHT.  Money itself says THIS IS YOUR GOD.

Although some fault the film for settling into its action plot, the ending has a great payoff. And the direction by John Carpenter is handled with superb workmanlike aplomb. One unforgettable set piece has Piper in a back-alley fistfight with a friend who won't put on the glasses that goes on and on, and just when you think it's over it goes another round.

{"description": "The definitive American television series of the '90s comes to the big screen with an anticlimactic whimper. And how could it be otherwise? Why should material so perfectly realized in one medium necessarily translate well into another? The series is crisply and thoughtfully executed in just about every detail, but the heart of its appeal lies in the elegant handling of complicated and evolving ongoing story lines, which is not something movies are especially good at. The big-screen drive for closure cramps the creative style, though it may also help nonfans get a grip on the proceedings. We do get some invigorating thrills and chills, however, and a more satisfying sense of the scale of an all-enveloping human-alien conspiracy than ever before, but there's no more plot development here than in an average two-part season-ending. FBI black sheep Mulder and Scully have been temporarily transferred from the X-Files project to an anti-terrorist unit to investigate an Oklahoma City-style bombing. They uncover a new wrinkle in the Syndicate/Cancer Man conspiracy--basically an attempt to help one bunch of (benign?) aliens fight off another bunch who want to colonize Earth. A spectacular, ice-bound finale thrillingly staged by series-veteran director Rob Bowman offers Mulder (but not a conveniently unconscious Scully) his first clear look at a You Know What, which in some quarters qualifies as an epochal event. Martin Landau offers the agents some crucial clues, and several familiar TV faces (including the Lone Gunmen and Mitch Pileggi's indispensable Assistant Director Skinner) turn up briefly to wink knowingly at faithful fans.--David Chute", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B001FACH7S", "B001G7PSZI", "B000UZDO5I", "6303402348", "080010367X"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 338484}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.95, "brand": "20th Century Fox", "asin": "6305142467", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41GEJ8WNSKL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The X-Files (Movie) [VHS]"}

{"description": "The 1998 testosterone-saturated blow-'em-up from producer Jerry Bruckheimer and director Michael Bay (The Rock,Bad Boys) continues Hollywood's millennium-fueled fascination with the destruction of our planet. There's no arguing that the successful duo understands what mainstream American audiences want in their blockbuster movies--loads of loud, eye-popping special effects, rapid- fire pacing, and patriotic flag waving. Bay's protagonists--the eight crude, lewd, oversexed (but lovable, of course) oil drillers summoned to save the world from a Texas-sized meteor hurling toward the earth--are not flawless heroes, but common men with whom all can relate. In this huge Western-in-space soap opera, they're American cowboys turned astronauts. Sci-fi buffs will appreciate Bay's fetishizing of technology, even though it's apparent he doesn't understand it as anything more than flashing lights and shiny gadgets. Smartly, the duo also tries to lure the art-house crowd, raiding the local indie acting stable and populating the film with guys like Steve Buscemi, Billy Bob Thornton, Owen Wilson, and Michael Duncan, all adding needed touches of humor and charisma. When Bay applies his sledgehammer aesthetics to the action portions of the film, it's mindless fun; it's only whenArmageddontackles humanity that it becomes truly offensive. Not sinceMississippi Burninghave racial and cultural stereotypes been substituted for characters so blatantly--African Americans, Japanese, Chinese, Scottish, Samoans, Muslims, French ... if it's not white and American, Bay simplifies it. Or, make that whitemaleAmerica; the film features only three notable females--four if you count the meteor, who's constantly referred to as a \"bitch that needs drillin',\" but she's a hell of a lot more developed and unpredictable than the other women characters combined.

They are also connected telepathically.\\nGrifters, infidelity and bribery drive a plot that reveals what the Stackpooles are up to in their isolated home.  But Myron really hates not being in control and the battle of wills and tortures begins.\\nWith liberal amounts of nudity, sex, and colorful characters this is an enjoyable and sometimes silly horror film that is very light on the blood and guts (although there is some finger breaking).  I found it to be quite rewatchable and one of the better thought out Full Moon films.

{"description": "Stephen Sondheim's landmark 1984 musicalSunday in the Park with Georgeis a fictional representation of maverick French Impressionist painter Georges Seurat's efforts to create his masterpiece,Sunday Afternoon on the Isle of La Grande Jatte. Seurat, played by Mandy Patinkin, is obsessed with his work, to the frustration of his mistress, Dot (Bernadette Peters). Along the way, we meet many other characters--whoever happens to be in the park that Sunday--who eventually become part of the canvas.Act 2 fast-forwards 100 years. Patinkin now plays Seurat's great-grandson, George, himself a frustrated artist. (Peters plays his grandmother--Seurat and Dot's daughter.) In the score's best-known song, \"Putting It Together,\" George (and Sondheim himself) explains the hazards of trying to create art while also confronting the reality of having to pay for it. In a search for inspiration, George travels to the original island where Seurat created the painting. As with Sondheim and cocreator James Lapine's next collaboration,Into the Woods,Sundayis often criticized for redirecting its focus in the second act instead of letting the first act stand by itself as a complete work. The second act, however, is the emotional core of the show, as George confronts all the feelings his great-grandfather had repressed so many years ago.Stephen Sondheim'sbrilliant scoreis remarkable for its combination of vivid colors (listen to his dots of sound that represent Seurat's pointillistic style of painting), character pieces, and sheer beauty. The cast is terrific, and the show, aced out of most of the 1984 Tony Awards byLa Cage aux Folles, won the Pulitzer Prize for drama.Recorded before a live audience,Sundayis especially entertaining on video, as the staging elements bring out the full humor and inventiveness of the show, and it is astonishing to see the disparate characters form themselves into the elements of the familiar painting. So many great musicals are banished to the memories of those who attended live or--even worse--immortalized as inferior movies.Sunday in the Park with Georgeis an absolute must-see for anyone interested in musical theatre, and a must-own for anyone with a passion for it. The DVD includes an audio track with commentary by Sondheim, Lapine, Patinkin, and Peters.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00001PE59", "B0013Z7RUC", "B008SBXFUU", "B000093NR3", "B0014IC31G", "B00404ME0G", "B00003CWT3", "B00005KH3H", "B0007WFXZI", "B004VWXUO6", "B000JGWD32", "B00004W5VC", "B000IOM0S8", "B008SBXFXM", "B000I2J6YG", "B0000C23HY", "B001LMAKAG", "B0014IC320", "0679439072", "B001VRDRH4", "B0028SVXVM", "0307957721", "B00BX8PG3Y", "B0060QSGJ0", "030759341X", "B00004XMTJ", "B000ATQYVK", "B0033HKCX2", "B000NTM9ZM", "B002M2Z3Q0", "B000BITUNE", "B004VWXUWS", "B00404ME24", "1557830681", "B00KRFE9UK", "B00004RFEZ", "B00000GC22", "B007Q1IT1I", "B002JT69LE", "B000649YA2", "B00KO76FSA", "B009NYF2GQ", "B00JAOW3MA", "B0009941IE", "B000UAE7NG", "0230614213", "B00IBQ5M1W", "B00JDCORSC", "B00IXD2N1K", "B00JM5CAHA", "B00JVQ7PIY", "B000059PQI", "B00CQUNSJM", "B00BDSRB2S", "B00H3UKZ6E", "1480367184", "B00008973A", "B0081NASLY", "B000VKL6RK", "B00BUQV728", "0810874369", "0783240287", "B0000648Y0", "B0000AM6IY", "B006GHA9QQ", "B00AATV0WS", "B0000026QC", "0767827929", "B00JPWSJOI", "B00J89SH4A", "B001P5HI4A", "B00B04NJ2G", "1480367168", "B00005JLIU", "B00GMM19X2", "B00I3LDEFQ", "B000002ORP", "B000JJSKZ4", "B000KN7BSG", "B000EZ9048", "B00AEBBAEK", "B000EWBKMG", "B00DVH20MA", "B00005UQ8F", "B000067D1R", "B00JK5C46E", "0307946843", "B003SPJ4C4", "B001EKH09E", "B005SFR7YE", "B00J2T18EW", "B000RPCK2E", "B00DPMFE6U", "B00007L4MV", "B000FIHNHK", "B001LMAKAQ", "B002HMHSEK", "156442796X", "B00E4XR7TG", "B0060QSGRC"], "bought_together": ["B00001PE59", "B0013Z7RUC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00001PE59", "B008SBXFUU", "B004VWXUO6", "B00004W5VC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 18078}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 12.05, "brand": "PETERS,BERNADETTE", "asin": "630530209X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51CY5AYYQQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Sunday in the Park with George"}
{"description": "By now, Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan have amassed such a fund of goodwill with moviegoers that any new onscreen pairing brings nearly reflexive smiles. InYou've Got Mail, the quintessential boy and girl next door repeat the tentative romantic crescendo that madeSleepless in Seattle, writer-director Nora Ephron's previous excursion with the duo, a massive hit. The prospective couple do actually meet face to face early on, butMailotherwise repeats the earlier feature's gentle, extended tease of saving its romantic resolution until the final, gauzy shot.The underlying narrative is an even more old-fashioned romantic pas de deux that is casually hooked to a newfangled device. The script, cowritten by the director and her sister Delia Ephron, updates and relocates the Ernst Lubitsch classicThe Shop Around the Cornerto contemporary Manhattan, where Joe Fox (Hanks) is a cheerfully rapacious merchant whose chain of book superstores is gobbling up smaller, more specialized shops such as the children's bookstore owned by Kathleen Kelly (Ryan). Their lives run in close parallel in the same idealized neighborhood, yet they first meet anonymously, online, where they gradually nurture a warm, even intimate correspondence. As they begin to wonder whether this e-mail flirtation might lead them to be soul mates, however, they meet and clash over their colliding business fortunes.It's no small testament to the two stars that we wind up liking and caring about them despite the inevitable (and highly manipulative) arc of the plot. Although their chemistry transcended the consciously improbable romantic premise ofSleepless, enabling director Ephron to attain a kind of amorous souffl&eacute;, this time around there's a slow leak that considerably deflates the affair. Less credulous viewers will challenge Joe's logic in prolonging the concealment of his online identity from Kathleen, and may shake their heads at Ephron's reinvention of Manhattan as a spotless, sun-dappled wonderland where everybody lives in million-dollar apartments and color coordinates their wardrobes for cocktail parties.--Sam Sutherland", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302936381", "6303637574", "6301796535", "B0001E7LQG", "0783241569", "0792151712", "0792116887", "0790739909", "B0000VD02E", "6301586026", "B00003CXFU", "6302820448", "6305132666", "B00004WIDB", "6301966988", "6303696813", "B0000DCGT1", "B000007OY0", "5559477621", "6301578805", "6304259131", "0782006779", "6300247236", "6302779278", "6303402348", "630394518X", "0790748169", "630150528X", "6300214222", "6303269842", "0783223218"], "bought_together": ["6302936381"], "also_viewed": ["B0000AOV4I", "6302936381", "B003BV8ICC", "B00008G7UF", "B00006ZXSK", "6302787068", "0790720434", "B00006ZXSL"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 68917}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6305368139", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/513FXJJZ5ZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "You've Got Mail [VHS]"}
{"description": "A year after his international breakthrough filmLa Strada, Federico Fellini and his leading lady/wife Giulietta Masina collaborated on another masterpiece, a magical mix of neorealism and romantic optimism set on the streets of Rome. Masina's moon-faced and bright-eyed Cabiria is a passionate streetwalker with a heart as big as Italy and the emotional spontaneity of a child, a woman with a hearty passion for life whose constant weakness is falling in love with mercenary creeps. For a couple of hours we share the dreams and disillusionments of Cabiria as she rattles around Rome before once again losing her heart. The bittersweet heartbreak is tempered with a soaring celebration of the human spirit: no other Fellini film offers such honest hope in the face of such bitter devastation. Fellini left the poor and the working class to revel in the decadence of Rome's high society for his next film,La Dolce Vita, a film that could have sprung from Cabiria's hilarious chance interlude with a matinee idol (played by Amedeo Nazzari). Rambling and leisurely paced,Nights of Cabiriais a sweet film of warmth and simple grace. It became the basis of Neil Simon's American musicalSweet Charity, with Shirley Maclaine taking Masina's role in Bob Fosse's film version.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300208591", "B000001A5E", "B001LMU1C8", "B00005QAPH", "6303855490", "6301224698", "B000GBEWMA"], "bought_together": ["B00005QAPH"], "also_viewed": ["B001LMU1C8", "B002U6DVQM"]}, "price": 28.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 186477}, "asin": "6305372594", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51WFJB4YR7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Nights of Cabiria [VHS]"}

{"description": "Rising to the challenge of Dogma 95's self-imposed restrictions on aesthetic freedom, Thomas Vinterberg'sThe Celebrationis a remarkable  example of the way limits can give rise to creative opportunity. (Dogma 95 is a  Danish filmmakers collective that also includes Lars von Trier, director ofBreaking the Waves. The group crafted a manifesto in which its members  vow to eschew special lighting, optical effects, props, and the visible imprint  of a director's personality in order to attain higher truths yielded by  characters.)The Celebration, shot with a small video camera and  transferred to 35mm film, concerns a black-tie birthday gathering for a  family patriarch, Helge (Henning Moritzen), which erodes into a battle after long-suppressed secrets are revealed and the chance to settle old scores  presents itself. Among the grievances are an accusation of incest and the  responsibility for the death of a child--gruesome stuff, but Vinterberg  doesn't characterize the partying crowd's reaction in quite the way one might have expected. In fact, the whole ofThe Celebrationis about  unexpected perspectives and vantage points emerging from out of nowhere, largely  due to Vinterberg's free hand at editing the film in such a way as to yank  truth from every corner. This is a strong work that belies skepticism over  Dogma 95's bare-bones trendiness, and is perhaps a harbinger of great work to  come from Vinterberg.--Tom Keogh", "price": 13.48, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 384694}, "asin": "6305495777", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RZGN5J8ZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Celebration [VHS]"}

{"description": "The beast inThe Flying Serpentis Quetzalcoatl, the feathered serpent god of  the Aztecs. Evil archaeologist George Zucco keeps this half-bird,  half-reptile creature caged in a secret chamber within some New Mexico ruins,  the better to guard a cache of Montezuma's hidden gold. The professor has  obviously cracked under the strain of his studies, leading his stepdaughter  to deliver the immortal line, \"I wish there was never any such thing as Aztec  Indians.\" (They probably feel the same way about you, honey.) The Q-monster's  killings are investigated by a radio sleuth, adding a weird wrinkle to the  scenario; important revelations in the story have a funny way of happening  while the sleuth's show is live on the air. Two reasons for seeing this  58-minute cheapie from rock-bottom PRC studio: George Zucco, the tireless, beetle-browed villain of countless '40s B&nbsp;movies (with the occasional  goodie, such as Moriarty inThe Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, thrown in),  and the campy Quetzalcoatl, a forerunner of Japanese horror-movie monsters. In this film, the Aztec deity generally resembles a poorly crafted pi&ntilde;ata  flung across a wire--he flaps his wings with that weird,  aerodynamically suspect motion familiar to Rodan-watchers. For more on the  adventures of Quetzalcoatl, see Larry Cohen's 1983 thrillerQ: The Winged Serpent, a nutty variation on the same creature.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00HFWETZ8", "B00D9EJFV4", "B00FMGPWNW", "B00D9EJFZA", "B0007R4T26", "B00007G1TI", "B00DOZNGC2", "B000EHSVJG", "B00005R1O7", "B000VX9WB4", "B000C20VNM", "B0047DKLBO", "B007HCI4SE", "B00B2M79XQ", "B005OT7XMU", "B009AGEWYA", "B00D3DJH7S", "B00BUWD7Q6", "B0000JD28S", "B001DM3QDM", "B00AOO5NW2", "B000787YRW", "B00B2TTVS0", "B00DE1LD6W", "B00AOO5QVK", "B000K0YM18", "B005E7SFH4", "B000BYA5I2", "B0079R1LNM", "B0000542CN", "B000RXVNCE", "B00AQMWEKG", "6305836833", "6305772711"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005OT7YX8", "B0007R4T26", "B0071EKJWM", "B00008973H"]}, "price": 9.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 252160}, "asin": "630547253X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/611R1F37K2L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Flying Serpent"}

{"description": "Generally acknowledged as a bona fide classic, this Francis Ford Coppola film is one of those rare experiences that feels perfectly right from beginning to end--almost as if everyone involved had been born to participate in it. Based on Mario Puzo's bestselling novel about a Mafia dynasty, Coppola'sGodfatherextracted and enhanced the most universal themes of immigrant experience in America: the plotting-out of hopes and dreams for one's successors, the raising of children to carry on the good work, etc. In the midst of generational strife during the Vietnam years, the film somehow struck a chord with a nation fascinated by the metamorphosis of a rebellious son (Al Pacino) into the keeper of his father's dream. Marlon Brando played against Puzo's own conception of patriarch Vito Corleone, and time has certainly proven the actor correct. The rest of the cast, particularly James Caan, John Cazale, and Robert Duvall as the rest of Vito's male brood--all coping with how to take the mantle of responsibility from their father--is seamless and wonderful.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["630021639X", "6302158176", "6300183211", "6304214502", "6300214826", "0790705141", "6303168507", "0790733927", "B00003CXE6", "630470786X", "6300267997", "0790741512", "6303471501", "6300271331", "6302054982", "6303686796", "B00005PJ8I", "B00004COR2", "0792842111", "6304258984", "6304509146", "0783216084", "6300215644", "6300216500", "B000062XM6", "0800199421", "B0002F6BQU", "0800116917", "630336568X", "6304508611", "B00000F13T", "6304935811", "6305363668", "B000005PFL", "6300182878", "0792116887", "6300182452", "B00005B238", "0792845684", "6300247171", "0792839846", "6302482712", "6302989787", "0790732017", "0800100832", "630442972X", "6304196954", "B000065U6Q", "6301208773", "B00000K2SC", "6302842263", "6304429274", "6303313345", "B0000A36J1", "B000059XY5", "079212569X"], "bought_together": ["630021639X", "6302158176"], "also_viewed": ["6302610702", "630021639X", "6301792734", "6303402348", "6300215830", "6304117752", "6300183211", "6302158176", "B00COYZF5A", "6300214060", "B000NTPDSW", "6305095566", "0792151712", "6305169187", "6303953425", "080010367X", "6302054982", "6301208773", "B000KX0ISG", "630310696X", "6302415853", "6304214502", "B00005B238", "6303168507", "B00E9PMMX0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 270877}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.98, "brand": "", "asin": "B000003KHS", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/11KQ3QC757L.jpg", "title": "The Godfather [VHS]"}
{"description": "Edward Scissorhandsachieves the nearly impossible feat of capturing the delicate flavor of a fable or fairy tale in a live-action movie. The story follows a young man named Edward (Johnny Depp), who was created by an inventor (Vincent Price, in one of his last roles) who died before he could give the poor creature a pair of human hands. Edward lives alone in a ruined Gothic castle that just happens to be perched above a pastel-colored suburb inhabited by breadwinning husbands and frustrated housewives straight out of the 1950s. One day, Peg (Dianne Wiest), the local Avon lady, comes calling. Finding Edward alone, she kindly invites him to come home with her, where she hopes to help him with his pasty complexion and those nasty nicks he's given himself with his razor-sharp fingers. Soon Edward's skill with topiary sculpture and hair design make him popular in the neighborhood--but the mood turns just as swiftly against the outsider when he starts to feel his own desires, particularly for Peg's daughter Kim (Winona Ryder). Most of director Tim Burton's movies (such asPee Wee's Big Adventure,Beetlejuice,Batman) are visual spectacles with elements of fantasy, butEdward Scissorhandsis more tender and personal than the others. Edward's wild black hair is much like Burton's, suggesting that the character represents the director's own feelings of estrangement and co-option. Johnny Depp, making his first successful leap from TV to film, captures Edward's childlike vulnerability even while his physical posture evokes horror icons like the vampire inNosferatuand the sleepwalker inThe Cabinet of Dr. Caligari. Classic horror films, at their heart, feel a deep sympathy for the monsters they portray; simply and affectingly,Edward Scissorhandslays that heart bare.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B001AGXEA6", "B008MU8ZM0", "B00AEBBA1I", "B00AEBB9V4", "B008UZBHYU", "B000I5XOWI", "B003UMW68Y", "B0065AO94W", "B001EZE5BU", "B008BSM1GO", "B008QE9VJI", "B0043EV774", "B00GR76W1Q", "B005LAIIA8", "B000M9BPEY", "B005DZ35RC", "B007NPKPN2", "B002UOMGZQ", "B00288KNJU", "B003M8NG94", "B004P29LEU", "B008U0XRD4", "B005DZ35TU", "B000JSI7B2", "B001O8DB1W", "B000NA22C6", "B002S6L6XY", "B000002OFD", "B004VLZUI6", "B0088EDMMS", "B005HARX4Y", "B004SIP7QC", "B001AQR3E4", "B00AJCUL2G", "B003L4Y5B2", "B0039208JE", "B0054QHHHE", "B002QEHPR4", "B0027VTMAE", "B001CO42MU", "B001AR4K8K", "B003UESJLK", "B001IKKMCW", "B000WUMLU0", "B006MOYH0M", "B00993FEUK", "B003ZHR6PW", "B00C888MJ8", "B001AQT0UY", "B00AEFXXFU", "B0039208QM", "B00164GDA0", "B005KQVDH8", "B001HN69B8", "B001D8W7CW", "B000WSLAUO", "B00005R87R", "B00FAI3JE6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001AGXEA6", "B008MU8ZM0", "B00AEBBA1I", "B008FD36IC"]}, "price": 8.5, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 449136}, "asin": "B000005QLO", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/511ADGQ59YL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Edward Scissorhands"}
{"description": "Four people enter the Belasco Mansion, the so-called \"Everest of haunted houses,\" hired by a dying millionaire to investigate the possibility of life after death. Physicist Clive Revill leads the quartet, which includes his wife Gayle Hunnicut and two mediums. Pamela Franklin, young and impulsive, immediately makes contact with what she perceives as a tortured spirit, while Roddy McDowall, the only survivor from the previous investigation 20 years ago, closes himself off completely, deathly afraid of the malevolent forces that crushed his former comrades in body and spirit. Science fiction and horror legend Richard Matheson, responsible for penning such horror classics asThe Devil Rides Outand Roger Corman'sThe Pit and the Pendulum, brings a literate sensibility and a refreshing seriousness to the haunted-house genre with this adaptation of his novelHell House. Director John Hough follows Matheson's lead with a moody but sober approach, balancing the physical threats of objects lethally leaping to life with the slow, subtle possession of the characters by a truly evil spirit. Parts of the script feel like so much scientific mumbo jumbo, with characters discussing the finer points of supernatural manifestation and ectoplasmic activity, but Hough's deliberate direction gives it the necessary solemnity to take it all seriously.--Sean Axmaker", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 481003}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "title": "Legend of Hell House [VHS]", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303957064", "0764006770", "B00000F0I2", "6300214087", "B00004WLXE"], "also_viewed": ["B00JHH22O4"]}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HZ8RPGGYL._SY300_.jpg", "asin": "B000006GFG"}

{"description": "Kingdom Hospitalis horror novelist Stephen King's adaptation of Danish director Lars Von Trier's cult miniseriesThe Kingdom, geared very much for an American audience. The story unfolds across 15 hours, telling the story of a hospital in Maine that's been built on the site of a 19th-century mill fire that killed most of its young occupants--themes that King fans will be familiar with. In the present day, Kingdom Hospital is haunted by the ghost of 10-year-old child worker Mary and, even more bizarrely, a fearsome giant anteater-like creature called Antubis. It falls to the ace doctor Hook (Andrew McCarthy), the paraplegic artist Jack Coleman (Peter Rickman), and the hypochondriac psychic Sally Druse (Diane Ladd) to enlist the help of a surreal assortment of hospital staff and patients to help Mary and save Kingdom Hospital itself from certain doom.Fans of Stephen King will probably enjoy the blend of black comedy, spectral horror, and general weirdness, which owes a big debt to previous television series likeTwin Peaksand evenER.

{"description": "Written and directed by Frank Wisbar, this hour-long B&nbsp;thriller  from 1946 is so obscure that it doesn't even rank an entry inLeonard Maltin's Movie & Video Guide, but it's a perfectly adequate example of the low-budget fare that was cranked out like sausages by Producer's Releasing Corporation (PRC) in post-World War&nbsp;II Hollywood. Of interest to trivia buffs is the youthful appearance of futurePink Pantherdirector Blake Edwards as the movie's youthful would-be hero, while Rosemary La&nbsp;Planche  plays his beloved, who would sacrifice herself to spare her lover from the title character--the shadowy ghost of a ferryman (played by Charles Middleton) who haunts the local swampland, avenging his wrongful hanging for murder. Steeped in rich, foggy atmosphere, the film copies the effective visual style of Wisbar's earlier German filmF&auml;hrmann Maria, and although this shoestring spooker barely registers on the fright meter, it's still an interesting oddity for hardcore film buffs, who will appreciate the fact that a movie of such minimal consequence has somehow made its way to DVD.

{"description": "If you've ever wanted to hear Jack Nicholson sing (or try to) or marvel at the sight of Ann-Margret drunkenly cavorting in a cascade of baked beans,Tommyis the movie you've been waiting for. As it turns out, the Who's brilliant rock opera is sublimely matched to director Ken Russell's penchant for cinematic excess, and this 1975 production finds Russell at the peak of his filmmaking audacity. It's a fever-dream of musical bombast, custom-fit to the thematic ambition of Pete Townshend's epic rock drama, revolving around the titular \"deaf, dumb, and blind kid\" (played by Who vocalist Roger Daltrey) who survives the childhood trauma that stole his senses to become a Pinball Wizard messiah in Townshend's grandiose attack on the hypocrisy of organized religion.The story is remarkably coherent considering the hypnotic dream-state induced by Russell's visuals. Tommy's odyssey is rendered through wall-to-wall music, each song representing a pivotal chapter in Tommy's chronology, from the bloodstream shock of \"The Acid Queen\" (performed to the hilt by Tina Turner) to Nicholson's turn as a well-intentioned physician, Elton John's towering rendition of \"Pinball Wizard,\" and Daltrey's epiphanous rendition of \"I'm Free.\" Other performers include Eric Clapton and (most outrageously) the Who's drummer Keith Moon, and through it all Russell is almost religiously faithful to Townshend's artistic vision. Although it divided critics when first released,Tommynow looks likes a minor classic of gonzo cinema, worthy of the musical genius that fueled its creation.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792841638", "B000001FR6", "B00009APB6", "B00028HBIO", "B001NHZ2KM", "B00HRWJGD6", "B000B9PW6M", "B00ELAMR60", "B000VLOKQI", "0767827929", "B001DWNUF6", "B008NR92SI", "B0000542D2", "B002NZK5TG", "B008RTE08E", "B000FA57SA", "B001EKP5D2", "6305882592", "B00004XMTJ", "B001UNSZOE", "6305038694", "B000002OX3", "B0000062XK", "B00000JRUQ", "B00AATV0WS", "B000002P6S", "B0002GTX8C", "B00005LIRB", "B004X63RRA", "B0000AM6IY", "0783233485", "B00005NFZQ", "B000002P6R", "B0013K1ALE", "6304806418", "B009NYF2GQ", "B0000AN4JE", "B0002CR04A", "B000002P2V", "B001RULSH6", "B000002GBW", "B000056NX5", "B002G1K82Q", "B000VSBX34", "B001JV5BEE", "B00008973A", "0792846095", "B0038M61DC", "B00006GF6Y", "B001JV5BF8", "B000002GB4", "B000059N1S", "B000002OX5", "B005GRF2WS", "B003ZYU3U0", "B006TTC5SG", "B003EYVXXC", "B004SEUJBE", "B000AYQJ3I", "B000065UFD", "B003LMPKSQ", "076781326X", "B00I5NKP7W", "B0007ZEOPK", "B00005BJBP", "B000VECAD0", "B00005JP4N", "B005LAIHR2", "B000CCW2U2", "B004JMZWMG", "0764337858", "B005DMNS4A"], "bought_together": ["B00028HBIO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00028HBIO", "B00JOWHTTA", "0792841638", "B00ELAMR60"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 25967}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 47.89, "brand": "WHO", "asin": "B00000K3TV", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ydZ9JHD1L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Tommy"}

At 178  minutes, it's long enough to establish the myriad inhabitants of Middle-earth,  the legendary Rings of Power, and the fellowship of hobbits, elves, dwarves, and  humans--led by the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and the brave hobbit Frodo  (Elijah Wood)--who must battle terrifying forces of evil on their perilous  journey to destroy the One Ring in the land of Mordor. Superbly paced, the film  is both epic and intimate, offering astonishing special effects and production  design while emphasizing the emotional intensity of Frodo's adventure. Ending on  a perfect note of heroic loyalty and rich anticipation, this wondrous fantasy  continues inThe Two Towers(2002).--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JKZV", "B00005JKZY", "B00BEZTMFY", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B005COPWZW", "B00005JM5E", "B002ZG980U", "B002PMV9FG", "B001GZ6QC4", "B007K3JFUQ", "B000U7WV1Y", "B00005JNJV", "B001OQCV6A", "B004M1A21K", "B008UZ7MYY", "B00HFFE8HE", "B000A9QKLO", "B000E8M0VA", "B000W7F5SS", "B0014C2FX8", "0618640150", "B001DHXT20", "B00E5I2M6I", "B00003CX5P", "B0013FDM7E", "B00AZMFJYA", "B00005QZWI", "B0019L770A", "B000I0RQVI", "B002IPFWTE", "B001CDR1FG", "B0006UEVT0", "B003TT2X6S", "B001OQCV2E", "B009JBWOU0", "B00005JL78", "B00005JNOG", "B001UV4XHY", "B00CNW9ZI6", "B00GKOJ98E", "0345325818", "B0014Z4ON4", "B000H30B2C", "B005LXQLRW", "B001UV4XIS", "B001GCUO1Q", "B00CZDLGDU", "0345538374", "B004LWZW42", "B007REV4T8", "B000W746GK", "B00005JPH2", "B003TT2X72", "B004LWZWGA", "B0087ZG7J8", "B005G4TJUC", "B003ZK99NQ", "B00006HBUJ", "B008UZA8FY", "B0090SI56Y", "B000VI70QS", "B00005JNC2", "B004WCTLNY", "B0014Z4OMU", "6305313687", "B004AKCME8", "B000E6EK2Y", "0547928211", "B000LC55F2", "B0002KVUKM", "B000FQJAIW", "B008JFUO72", "B000FIMG68", "B005LAIHSG", "B005LAIIT4", "B004AOECXI", "B00029RTCG", "B000P0J0EM", "B002HWRYJE", "B0060FXDCG", "B001ECQ75A", "0792839749", "B00AEFXZJE", "B005LAII0I", "B0042U94UQ", "B001HN6918", "B00008G8M5", "B008JFURII", "B003ZKBELG", "B000P0J09W", "B003XURDAY", "B00335EQ0E", "B00008G8M4", "0547928203", "B000W796OM", "B00006ADD5", "B00J49R1BY", "B00B04NIZO", "B00G5G7EXY", "B00001ZWUS"], "bought_together": ["B00005JKZV", "B00005JKZY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00HFFE8HE", "B00005JKZY", "B00BEZTMFY", "B00005JKZV"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 3641}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.49, "brand": "NEW Line Home Video", "asin": "B00003CWT6", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Dj%2BQ1hLBL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)"}

{"description": "Many Hollywood directors should follow Rod Lurie's lead and invite their stars to do the DVD commentary. Oscar nominee Joan Allan joins Lurie, turning the commentary track into an enjoyable conversation. It tends to be a lovefest at times but does give insight into the relationship between a lead actor and director during filmmaking. Over the end credits, Lurie mentions the brouhaha that actor (and producer) Gary Oldman started when he made discouraging comments about the film's final cut. It's interesting to note none of Oldman's work ends up in the dozen deleted scenes shown on the DVD. The scenes have much more meat on the bone than most and illustrate some curious character development. The half-hour making-of featurette has the standard press-kit materials but also gives us a good background on the history of political thrillers.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783227973", "B0060ZJ7DA", "0780622561", "B001ECDVK4", "B0043X1FNQ", "B000CEXEWA", "B004IFYMWK", "B00AEFYTMQ", "B00003CWRX", "6304696507", "B00AEFYUQQ", "6305297142", "B003ASLJIQ", "B00005JNP4", "B0001V6ZJI", "B001ECDVJU", "B0059XTTW8", "0783116934", "B0013XZ2QK", "B000067IZ3", "B00005BCK9", "B00000K3TU", "0792159659", "B00005UM2X", "B000C65Z1G", "B00441GYTC", "6305428522", "B00003CXQG", "630542828X", "B002NZK5UU", "6305310335", "B00000IQC0", "B002EAYE42", "B00005OOQ2", "B002ZG993Q", "B004SIP6C2", "B005FITIGO", "B0043X1FKY", "B00004RF83", "0767802519", "B00006ZXSN", "0783229402", "B006ML50QK", "B00003CXPV", "0800141806", "B00DW5IK9S", "B000BYRCQU", "B00006L92U", "B000CQLZ8S", "B00008K76V", "B00AEBB8LA", "B000Y11B8U", "0767803434", "B007KAUWO2", "6304696515", "B003Y5H4R0", "B0000542C5", "B0011V7PSC", "B00GUO2SKA", "B00G7QQ3AC", "0790730979", "B00AEFXUXU", "B001PR0Y8K", "B00000K3CS", "B00015YVDG", "1558908382", "B00AEFXYJA", "B00008K76U", "B002DU39GW", "0792845811", "B004SIP7F8", "B000056HEA", "B0039UT3LK", "B0007IO6NM", "B00JA3RVG4", "B00G7QPXUI", "B00004XPPB", "B00005BCKF", "0764585533", "B00GMV8M2Y", "B0000SXK0E", "B000063US3", "B004FQX59I", "B00008K7AO", "B00AEFYIH2", "B00003CXFV", "B001GLX6UI", "B00006RCNY", "B0045HCJJ4", "B00BTYRB58", "6305428115", "B001AMHNKW", "B0012EBV6A", "0767811100", "B0060ZJ7AI", "B0009GX1CE", "B000HT38IK", "B00004ZBVO", "B00005ATZT"], "bought_together": ["0783227973", "0780622561"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0064470393", "0783227973"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 40208}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 13.99, "brand": "", "asin": "B00003CXP7", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/411PCH1X0RL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Contender"}

Brando may be enormous and breathing heavily with every move, but his technique is as agile as it ever was; he still seems spontaneously clever. Oz doesn't have the most crackling visual style in the world, as the film is far too smooth for tension, and keeps tapping Howard Shore's music score to do most of the work in that department; the divine Angela Bassett is once again totally wasted in a 10-minute throwaway role as De Niro's girlfriend.The Scoreisn't anything new, and there isn't a single surprise, but if you're into this sort of thing you do respond to its polished familiarity.--Steve Wiecking", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 801891}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "title": "Score", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005UQ9T", "B0047T74CM", "B00008K7AO", "B0015OKWL2", "6305263248", "B001MZ5W3M", "B000P0J0AG", "B0000B1OFL", "B002WNU0QW", "B00562D3Y2", "B00005JLX2", "B002O3Z4Y8", "B002O3Z4WK", "B000ENC5YW", "B000GFLKF8", "B001NY4WYC", "6305313687", "B001C5LLLY", "B00096S49Y", "B002DU39GW", "B00005LDDD", "B00005V9HH", "B000K7VHQ4", "B003L20IG0", "B00004XPPB", "B00AEFXT1S", "B005LAIGRS", "B00AEBB95K", "B000GDH9NM", "B0034G4OSG", "B0000DI87S", "B00005JLKN", "B00005JKBC", "B000C20VPA", "B000P0J09M", "0800141822", "B00008O38F", "0783240295", "B00AEBB9NM", "B0008KLVAU", "B000QUCRB4", "B000M341QE", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B002VWNIEA", "B002AT8K9W", "B002CPMB9O", "B003ASLJIQ", "0767830555", "6305310335", "B00004ZDFL", "0783226888", "B00AEBB86A", "6305428115", "B000067IZ3", "B001N44BVQ", "B000NOIX48", "B001UV4XRY", "B000OYAT3U", "B00HOGBXS6", "B004EPYZP8", "B002ZG99N6", "B000286RP2", "B002NZK5VO", "6304711891", "B00011CZRE", "B000069HZP", "B0019EXZY4", "B000GRUMSM", "0767802519", "B000CNESTE", "B001BP4K22", "B002QEHPQU", "B00FRILRL6", "B00CX7TOOG", "B0051MKNV8", "B00015YVDG", "B004HO6HWA", "B00BEIYN9Q", "B00AEFXIIW", "B00AEFYF2K", "B000R4SMCW", "B00441GYZ6", "B0006HBZXS", "B000MXPE7O", "B00005BCKF", "B00008OE4W", "B004SIP7VM", "B0062P3392", "B00BB67UNW", "B0006GANOQ", "B00005JN0W", "B00AEFXEGS", "B000244GCW", "B002AT8KAG", "B003AWRMCE", "B004SIP8ZM", "B003A12WBQ", "B008JFUNKU", "B00KHA99BY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002O3Z4Y8", "6304711891", "B00562D3Y2", "B000GFLKF8"]}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21SM525DAZL.jpg", "asin": "B00003CY5H"}

{"description": "How can a movie be so ludicrous and so ecstatic at the same time?The Lovers on the Bridgestars Juliette Binoche as a street person (there, in a nutshell, is the ludicrous part) who was formerly an artist, but began to go blind and whose life fell apart as a result. She hooks up with a homeless street performer (Denis Lavant) who lives on a bridge in the middle of Paris that has been cordoned off for repairs. He falls madly in love with her; she can't bear the thought of being close to anyone. Both are more than a little irrational. But this banal scenario is merely the pretext for a series of lush and stunning images--including  midnight water-skiing, fireworks displays, wandering through falling snow, burning posters in subway tunnels--and richly committed performances from the actors. It's not quite as overwhelming on video as it is on a movie screen, but there's such a gushing of emotional images that it's hard to resist the angst and yearning passion. Though the film dives into some cliches, it manages to avoid others; when Binoche's wealthy family starts  looking for her, a frightened Lavant tries to keep her hidden away, and you really don't know whether their relationship can possibly survive. An unusual and sweeping film--and an example of the power of visual images to create a state of rapture.--Bret Fetzer", "price": 19.98, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 543070}, "asin": "B00003L9CA", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71AHKKMNGSL._SY300_.gif", "title": "The Lovers on the Bridge [VHS]"}

They pick rich and beautiful couple Beau and Naomi (Joshua Jackson and Kate Hudson) as the focus of the rumor, and before you know it their juicy story starts spinning out of control into ugly territory and a truly ludicrous climax.

{"description": "Mostly for Poirot completists and admirers of then-trendy, all-star ensemble casts from the 1970s and early '80s,Evil Under the Sunfinds Peter Ustinov in his second outing as Agatha Christie's famous Belgian detective (three years after 1978'sDeath on the Nile). As the title promises, the action this time takes place on an Adriatic island (though Christie fans will surely balk at the switch from the novel's setting on the English coast), where a famous stage star (Diana Rigg) is murdered, and the list of likely suspects is unusually high. The parade of legendary performers--Roddy McDowall, James Mason, Sylvia Miles, Maggie Smith, Jane Birkin--plus Ustinov's energetic performance keep things hopping. But Anthony Shaffer's lazy screenplay and director Guy Hamilton's superficial approach nudge everything (action, characters, tone) toward campy, near-parody, with bitchy sniping, tacky costumes, and an obligatory soundtrack of Cole Porter tunes. It's only in the last lap that the film transcends such obviousness and finds its way back to the glories of detective fiction.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001KP2J3U", "B00AEFYO5I", "B001KP2J3K", "B000GB5M1A", "B00005QBZL", "B00005RDRO", "B002Q3MYA8", "B000GB5M1K", "B000068QOB", "B000GB5M1U", "B000CSTK38", "B00000JGHT", "B00AEFXNXW", "B000199JJI", "B0090XLDO0", "B000068UE9", "B004HHX9H8", "B00A0HT99G", "B003L80FLC", "B00005Q4D6", "0790741318", "B00005KH4B", "B00000I0DA", "B00008K772", "B0028AENVC", "B004HJ0ZLE", "B005X5XINI", "B000059LGD", "B00347AIRQ", "B008RNYMPG", "B00GWXHYPI", "B00GWXI0S8", "B00GAXASKS", "B001KP2J44", "B007CBWXD2", "B00D7AM2V0", "B000CRR36K", "B002HR456E", "B007ISJS0U", "B008N8A3O4", "B002MUAXJY", "630560097X", "B00GAXASLC", "B000CRR3EC", "B0008ENICU", "B00ICWO1LC", "B00KIZY3XW", "B00AEBB97S", "B00871C09S", "B000OHBCI8", "B002XDR5NC", "B000CC1TNI", "B00AEFY8ZE", "B0019K4YRU", "B00598OA7W", "B00DW5IKWK", "B000199JJS", "B00GHH9I62", "B00005RIX1", "B00EF0NYVI", "B00CBVWWLQ", "B00A27O5AW", "B0083HXKM2", "B00BDSRM4K", "B004Z74X0M", "B008N8A3DA", "B000GAKFIG", "B000G67M4U", "B0007Y3XRG", "B00347AIOE", "B008L0YN22", "B00598O9RI", "B005DVIPY4", "B005X5XI4C", "B00009ZPU3", "B00E8AVN9U", "B00GWXI16O", "B000IJ7AGK", "B004WMOSNM", "B0002HOEQ2", "0062073710", "B005H8G78O", "B006JY3O2M", "0783226853", "B00E44EZUE", "B003N2SUKY", "B000056HEA", "B001BGS17Q", "B00GWXI20E", "B005CFBZX4", "B00007G1WH", "B00GWXI2MC", "B00GWXI2RM", "B002TOL4EG", "B000ATQYWY", "B002GSXKQA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001KP2J44", "B001KP2J3U", "B00AEFYO5I", "B00005RDRO"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 247598}, "asin": "B000059LGF", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51W8TYE3MPL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Evil Under the Sun"}

{"description": "When Sarah (Neve Campbell) strikes up a conversation with a sad-eyed man called Alex (William H. Macy) at her therapist's office, she asks, \"Are you one of those middle-aged guys who's tired of his marriage and thinking maybe a beautiful young thing could help him out?\" She's right, but the source of Alex's depression is far from typical: he's a second-generation hit man who wants out, but his mom and dad won't let him quit.Donald Sutherland makes Alex's laconic and utterly monstrous father the most frightening parent since John Huston inChinatown. A series of flashbacks show how he introduced Alex to his trade, beginning with shooting squirrels in the woods. We never find out whether Alex's father has mob connections, and the fact that it's just a business to him (\"This one's a big job, lots of moola, I'll buy your mother a Lexus\") makes him all the more chilling. Alex's mother (the steely Barbara Bain) knows all about the family business, but his wife (Tracey Ullman) thinks he runs a mail-order company, and the only person he confides in is a therapist (John Ritter). When he meets and falls for Sarah, Alex realizes that he alone can stand up to his father, and he needs to act before his own son becomes the next apprentice.Henry Bromell's debut film as a writer-director probes the same dark corners of the middle-aged male psyche asAmerican BeautyandThe Sopranos. Alex's tormented life is a symbol of the damage that parents can inflict on their children, and Bromell imbues his story with a tragic inevitability.Panicreceived a shamefully limited theatrical release, in spite of its rare combination of a great script and brilliant performances. It deserves to be rediscovered and appreciated by a much larger audience on home video.--Simon Leake", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0007R4TIU", "B007TBJUVI", "B0001EFV7C", "B0002S94C0", "B00005V1XK", "B00003CXNY", "B00018D40O", "B00441GZ00", "B00D5XC8PE", "B00005BCKF", "B009AMAJPA", "B000G1R4RU", "B004FZWDPG", "B00005M2CO", "B00AEFXV3E", "B00006CXGZ", "B000H6SXYM", "B0053TWVQ4", "B00009V7RV", "B001J710Y8", "B000KGGIZK", "B0014D5R9G", "B00008L3S6", "B000CQLZ8S", "B00CX7TOOG", "B0001GF2D8", "B00CJ6EKT0", "B0071HPOHY", "B00003CXDJ", "B00079HZQ6", "B00003CWU3", "B00003CXKS", "0792838068", "B000UAE7KO", "B0001XAOPM", "B000067J3P", "B000RO6K76", "B001NY4WYC", "B007IUEEA2", "B0014GI6I2", "B004P7CMVE", "B008220DGE", "0783226853", "B00003CXGA", "B00005K3NR", "B002VWNICC", "B0034G4P30", "B00C3ALLFS", "B006M3M5FM", "B00005V9HH", "B00BLF9FOK", "B00BMJ7ZKG", "B00AEFYIH2", "B00006FD96", "B007VYECQQ", "630473784X"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B007TBJUVI", "B001TOD6N4", "B0007R4TIU", "B0001EFV7C"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 462511}, "asin": "B00005AA9G", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51YAK36DE5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Panic"}

{"description": "Gosford Parkfinds director Robert Altman in sumptuously fine form indeed. From the opening shots, as the camera peers through the trees at an opulent English country estate, Altman exploits the 1930s period setting and whodunit formula of the film expertly. Aristocrats gather together for a weekend shooting party with their dutiful servants in tow, and the upstairs/downstairs division of the classes is perfectly tailored to Altman's method (as employed inNashvilleandShort Cuts) of overlapping bits of dialogue and numerous subplots in order to betray underlying motives and the sins that propel them. Greed, vengeance, snobbery, and lust stir comic unrest as the near dizzying effect of brisk script turns is allayed by perhaps Altman's strongest ensemble to date. First and foremost, Maggie Smith is marvelous as Constance, a dependent countess with a quip for every occasion; Michael Gambon, as the ill-fated host, Sir William McCordle, is one of the most palpably salacious characters ever on screen; Kristin Scott Thomas is perfectly cold yet sexy as Lady Sylvia, Sir William's wife; and Helen Mirren, Emily Watson, and Clive Owen are equally memorable as key characters from the bustling servants' quarters below.Gosford Parkmanages to be fabulously entertaining while exposing human shortcomings, compromises, and our endless need for confession.--Fionn Meade", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000BITVAG", "B007A2O3FO", "B00003CXC9", "B005S9EJ14", "B0000CE684", "B00AZMFO6I", "B0080QOL10", "630560097X", "B000LPS34E", "B000E8JNQU", "B004ALIG2O", "B00005UNCB", "B004JMSIQS", "6305692696", "B00F1BFRA6", "B002TZS58I", "B0002DRDY6", "B004SIP7D0", "B000E0ODZE", "B0001US78G", "B004XVMCMQ", "B004XYOQU4", "1557045313", "B005SYZYYK", "B000F3UAFC", "B000063K2Q", "B00003CX8N", "B0009GX1CE", "B001KP2J3U", "B0006Z2NAY", "B008NNY8TK", "B00062IZ0Y", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B005CFBZX4", "B004U7MQZ6", "B0001I55M4", "B00005O7N8", "0788815490", "B00GSBMNOQ", "B003UESJH4", "B0001DCYUU", "B0000797E7", "B008RO6PJQ", "B0013K2ZGI", "B000ETRCN0", "B00005OBAL", "B0009PVZM8", "6305918880", "B0080QOKYS", "B00HUAH14Q", "B00009IB1D", "B000A8AXXG", "B00GWXI16O", "B00C888OFA", "B00GAXASLC", "1250020360", "B000N4SHOE", "B004H0ZHD4", "B0099Y2MYK", "B009B1EPQ4", "B001CW7ZT4", "1573629723", "B009T6CXG0", "B001GJ4U5A", "B004SIP98S", "B00G15MDI0", "B00B62R9XM", "B004SIP9U6", "B0080QOL1A", "B000069HZU", "B004N66XYE", "B004XVMCKS", "1250047900", "B004499LWG", "B00AY2DL78", "6305428557", "B00A1EOC22", "B00D49YEHO", "B00BTYJYR6", "B0001US61O", "B0006Q9482", "B007701RFS", "B0073U2EWM", "B00F98FOI6", "B000092T3P", "B000CCW2O8", "B000065V3V", "B004HHX9H8", "B00HYZ0ZLS", "B00JFH8GZA", "B003DUBAXK", "B00AEFYO5I", "B00005U2KC", "B004SIP7F8", "B00GAHJO8G", "B00005RDRO", "B00DW5IKWK", "B00D3PYQT0", "B00005JOA0"], "bought_together": ["B000BITVAG", "B005S9EJ14"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AZMFO6I", "B000BITVAG", "630560097X", "B00005UNCB"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 7477}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 10.27, "brand": "Universal Studios", "asin": "B00005JKNF", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51oleUlbquL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Gosford Park - Collector's Edition"}

{"description": "The key component of this Vista Series DVD is a six-part documentary about the making of the film from idea to theatrical release. M. Night Shyamalan talks at length about the film and his filmmaking technique in this exclusive one-hour feature. The approach is straightforward but at times is as self-congratulatory as a marketing puff piece. Because Shyamalan works so leanly, the five deleted scenes are excellent, including a chilling scene from the film's final act. Also included are storyboard comparisons and another glimpse of one of Shyamalan's early home movies.Signsis the first of the Vista Series to be a single disc and the extras seem light, but there are only a couple of quibbles: the director again does not provide a commentary track and there is no DTS soundtrack.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00004BZIY", "B00064LJVE", "B001DZOC6Y", "B00003CXQA", "B000JLTR8Q", "B004SIP92O", "B00AEFYYH6", "B003102JDC", "B00005JNTI", "B00000G3PA", "B002GHHHKQ", "B003Y5H4SO", "B0002DB54A", "B00008G8M4", "B00AEBBA2W", "B0000648X0", "630471193X", "B002O3Z50G", "B00011CZRE", "B000PHVZNE", "B0087ZG7HK", "B002NZK5SM", "B00004XPPG", "B00005JOC9", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B0021L8UXA", "0783225733", "B0006L0LOS", "B0006SGYL0", "B000NOKFHQ", "B005LAIHXQ", "0800177029", "6305767866", "B00004TS0G", "6304711891", "B00AEFY3MC", "B002GIBVVG", "B004SIP8ZM", "B000U1ZV8K", "B00005JNY3", "B00070FX5U", "B00AEBB8NI", "B0002KVUKM", "B00008G8LY", "B000F6IOAM", "B00005JN0T", "B00AEBBA36", "B002LMV7R0", "B002NZK5UU", "B0013FDM7E", "B002O3Z4WK", "B0068FZ0GK", "B00015YVDG", "B000LC55F2", "B00001ZWUS", "B002GHHHL0", "B000BTJDGC", "B000EHRVOW", "B0087ZG7J8", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00005JN2Z", "B000P0J0EM", "B00AEFXSLE", "B00019073K", "B00005LC4D", "B00005JL78", "B00IBKXSKA", "B004EPYZPS", "B00000JDIQ", "B00AEBB9WI", "B000RIWAVW", "0780618548", "B004SIP7ZS", "B00005JN0W", "B00AEFXNLY", "6305428115", "0767811100", "0800141601", "B00AEFXT1S", "0780631536", "B00000IQC4", "B004P7CNUY", "B001GCUO02", "B002AS464Q", "B00003CWS3", "B00006FDCD", "B000FS9FCG", "B00005JKZH", "B000067FP8", "B000K7VHQE", "B00BEIYG98", "B00005JNNT", "B000068NNU", "B000XT1P4S", "B0087ZG7PW", "B002O3Z4ZW", "B002I9Z8BM", "B00AEFXKUI", "B0010X73ZG", "B00003CXIP"], "bought_together": ["B00004BZIY", "B004SIP92O"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00004BZIY", "B00386EZUY", "B000QUU4M8", "B0000VCZK2"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 11300}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.99, "brand": "Touchstone Video", "asin": "B00005JL3T", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51c02AOAyCL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Signs"}

{"description": "With its disturbing images and a few good shocks,The Ringis the kind of frightfest you'll watch to set a chilling mood or spook your susceptible friends, but when you try to sort it out, this well-mounted American remake (of the 1998 Japanese hitRingu, based on Koji Suzuki's popular novel) becomes a batch of incoherent parts. The negligible plot follows a Seattle reporter (Naomi Watts) as she investigates the death of her niece, the victim of a mysterious videotape that, according to urban legend, causes the viewer's death seven days later. (Fear Dot Comborrowed the same idea while avoiding this film's lofty pretensions.) The countdown structure follows the reporter, her son, and her estranged boyfriend into deepening layers of terror--all quite effective until the movie attempts to explain itself.

{"description": "One of TV's more interesting tough-girl action shows,Dark Angelis a distinctive blend of the personal, the adventurous, and the politically aware. Cocreators James Cameron and Charles Eglee present a complex scenario of biological super-science and social collapse in which their gene-manipulated heroine and hacker-journalist hero can genuinely make a difference. In this first season they also provide an adversary who is a lot more than just a conventional villain.Jessica Alba is impressive as Max, bred and trained as a super-soldier but reclaiming her individual humanity; Michael Weatherly is scruffily attractive as Eyes Only, who sits semi-paralyzed in his eyrie above Seattle uncovering crime, corruption, and other skullduggeries and assigning deadly errands to the woman he hopelessly loves. Jon Savage has real authority as Lydeker, a man who has stretched his conscience to the breaking point, but is not personally corrupt. Some of the best episodes--\"Prodigy,\" for example--are ones in which Lydeker and Max are forced into temporary alliance. Early on, the relationship between Max and the other workers at Jam Pony--the courier firm that provides her with a cover identity--is a little forced, but later on the two parts of Max's life are more successfully integrated: \"Shorties in Love,\" for example, is a genuinely touching tale about Diamond, the doomed criminal ex-lover of Max's lesbian roommate.Dark Angelwas never a perfect show, but at its occasional best it manages to be simultaneously funny and dramatic.--Roz Kaveney", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000O77SN6", "B00170LCWC", "B00191AEYQ", "B000AO9BSS", "B000SMNL92", "B0024FAR66", "B0002XVKMM", "0345451821", "B002JVWR4U", "B001MVWRMU", "0345451848", "034545183X", "B00083FZGI", "B004CWLRF4", "B001MVWRNO", "B001MVWRMK", "B00133QNRW", "B001MVWRN4", "B001MVWRNE", "B004YPED14", "B0012IX35S", "B00BHLTIXQ", "B0020PFYHC", "B00007LB4B", "B0012IXBNC", "B005UL4NH0", "B0009JE6FM", "B00HUPC5X8", "B00133QNSG", "B00133QNS6", "B00HUCF7AO", "B001AQO43M", "B004X60QE2", "0345451856", "B000I0QLQY", "B003U6SJY0", "B0010TDRP0", "B004XM38CS", "B0009JE6G6", "B0007DA3V6", "B00KHA9BQ2", "B000EHSVN2", "B0009A5MUO", "B00FEVZDC0", "B007H9CNOI", "B006YG9HJE", "B003KW7CQ0", "B000NQQ4DI", "B000NOKFGW", "B002BWP2IK", "1848561032", "B003L77GWE", "B000I0QLRI", "B0047BXR8U", "B003UD7JEE", "B005FISC3Y", "B006LG74Q0", "B000667HBS", "B002QU1Z1K", "B000I0QLR8", "B00008ZL4Q", "1848567383", "B000T9OP7G", "B0051GOB2G", "B00B4804LM", "B0090F6SD4", "B00BGI086Q", "B00IWTVDUW", "1608871452", "1845765354", "B000BTIU4S", "B003R0MEYA", "B00441GYVA", "B00BVMXBDO", "B0057FGD3Q", "B002CLKP00", "B001CY5N00", "B004KPLVXG", "B00344EAQO", "B0046XG48O", "B000R7GKQE", "1781161089", "B003MX91H0", "B000SO7LQO", "B00BD6K54G", "B00JF5G8WU", "B000QUEQ4U", "B007XF0XVQ", "B002JVWR54", "B002U0KHME", "B0016QNSGA", "B009LDD5XQ", "B00466H3CW", "B000FJH5MC", "B002ZCY872", "B003YF9Q08", "B003VJTGNO", "B005PPMHO2", "B000X5SPBI", "B0009X76XW"], "bought_together": ["B000O77SN6", "B00170LCWC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000O77SN6", "B00152R4VK", "B0024FAR66", "B002JVWR4U"]}, "price": 24.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 73439}, "asin": "B00005JLJM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51XY8FXSCVL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Dark Angel - The Complete First Season"}
{"description": "James Bond DVDs have in general been pretty loaded, butDie Another Dayraises the bar with a two-disc set featuring dynamic DTS 6.1 ES and Dolby Digital 5.1 EX sound that makes good use of the rear speakers. The first commentary track is by Pierce Brosnan and Rosamund Pike (who plays villain Miranda Frost). They weren't together at the time, so their comments are spliced into one track. Brosnan has a good time watching and is proud of the film but also doesn't take himself too seriously (\"They don't teach you this stuff at drama school: 'OK, now you're going to be electrocuted by the bad guy.'\"). Self-proclaimed \"Bond novice\" Pike also is proud of the film and says she's annoyed by people who question whether there's still a need for Bond. On the second commentary track, director Lee Tamahori and producer Michael G. Wilson chat about topics as diverse as casting, Bond lore, and product placements. For more Bond lore, don't overlook the trivia track, which offers pop-up tidbits about the filming and tips on the inside jokes.The centerpiece of the second disc is the 80-minute \"InsideDie Another Day\" documentary, which is a set of featurettes strung together. Topics include the opening surfing sequence; the scenes set in North Korea and Cuba (including Halle Berry's bikini tribute to Ursula Andress); the ice palace; post-production elements such as computer graphics, editing, and music; the car battle (finding strong ice was the key safety issue); and the passing of the \"Q\" torch from Desmond Llewellyn to John Cleese.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000NIBURQ", "B000M53GM2", "B000RPCK1U", "B000NDEXPM", "B000M53GMW", "B000RPCK1K", "B000RPCK24", "B000NIBURG", "B000M53GLS", "B000RPCK1A", "B000NIBUR6", "B000M53GN6", "B001PPLIEG", "B001R10BN2", "B00AQSN7HE", "B000RPCK0Q", "B000M53GNG", "B000NIBUS0", "B000NDEXPC", "B00004RG62", "B000M53GMC", "B007REV4T8", "B00004WEJZ", "B00005JL0I", "B009PN18R2", "B008YAPQX4", "B004BR7XLM", "B009PN3OD8", "B003QO8TOQ", "B000HRMAPE", "B000VNMMR0", "B0000BYRO7", "B00AZFECL8", "B000EGDB10", "B004EPYZUS", "B0004Z33EQ", "B00AIBZMD6", "B009A87Z6U", "B009RO9LKK", "B000SK5Z70", "B00003CXMV", "6305657947", "B00005JLYW", "B00005JN2Z", "B00023B1LC", "B005PTYP70", "B00008G8M4", "B00005JNJV", "B00000G3PA", "B000P0J06K", "B002UZCJ8Y", "B002ZG9864", "0792844068", "B00005JKIP", "0792166736", "0790732238", "B00AS1Q93S", "B003Q6D2B4", "B0002I84N0", "B000U1ZV8K", "B008JFURII", "B00JA3RVG4", "B000MZHW40", "B00026ZG10", "0790732149", "B000FKO3HG", "B000AP04FG", "B008JFUS0U", "B0001FGC1U", "B00005JMQW", "B009L6UDUG", "B00AVWIQZS", "B0013BM63O", "B00005JLRT", "B00E5I2M6I", "B001TK80C0", "B00AZMFJYA", "B0007KZQAM", "B002ZG999U", "B00BUAEYVK", "B009A87ZQU", "B000P0J06U", "B008JFUO72", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B00003CY0V", "B00E5I2MCM", "B0036TGSR6", "B003AWRMBU", "B0000BYRO9", "B008JFUNHI", "B00177YA1K", "6304696221", "B0021L8V0M", "B00006G8FD", "B000UR9T8C", "B002GNOSFM", "B003UESJFQ", "B0006L0LOS", "B000AYELVU"], "bought_together": ["B000NIBURQ", "B000M53GM2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000M53GM2", "B000RPCK1U", "B000M53GN6", "B000RPCK0Q"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 38500}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.0, "brand": "MGM", "asin": "B00005JLBE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51kgPWMuVFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Die Another Day (Widescreen Special Edition)"}
{"description": "There's only one deleted scene in this two-disc DVD set, but it's a doozy. The \"Sgt. Candy Scene\" is a must-see and, unfortunately, the best thing on the second disc. The rushed HBO documentary shows us far more flash than substance. Better is the Visual Effects Lab that goes more in-depth with four sequences, although you need to wade through a hokey interface for each segment. Making your \"own\" effects isn't that much fun; you can only choose a few effects that change in two scenes. Anyone looking to get the complicated backstory of the trilogy figured out should dig into the \"Sky Net Database\" and an intricate timeline. The two commentary tracks are worth a listen, with director Jonathan Mostow's solo track the better one. The director goes into great detail on how the little things (from lighting street scenes to tricks for destroying buildings) count.  The second track is pieced together from the actors recorded separately. Mostow appears with actress Claire Danes (doing her first commentary track) and their chemistry is enjoyable after a slow start. The other actors have less interesting things to say, including Schwarzenegger who is constantly--yet enthusiastically--selling the film.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001VLBDD0", "B00005N5S5", "B001FB55HQ", "B00005JA8B", "B00070FX5U", "B00007AJG4", "B002ZG98LO", "B000T9OP7G", "B002GHHHME", "B00005JKIP", "B002QFYJFY", "B0002J58HO", "B0000AXE8I", "B001AQO43M", "B00AKGG828", "B00026ZG10", "B0001BKAEY", "B00IZZDWKM", "B001451HXO", "B0000VCZK2", "B000056PMU", "B000BPL2FQ", "B000RW3VCK", "B0004Z33F0", "B000U1ZV8K", "B0045HCJGC", "B0004Z33EQ", "B00005JNTU", "B000HRMAPE", "B00008G8M4", "B000RRS7RE", "B00005JKYX", "B0000VD12I", "B000FC2FQA", "B00000ILDG", "B00000G3PA", "B00005JMZK", "B000MGBSE4", "B0087ZG7J8", "B0004Z33EG", "B000P0J0AQ", "B00005JMEW", "B0087ZG7NO", "B00003CXTA", "B0002CHK1S", "B000RJO56E", "B00177YA1K", "B00004STDN", "B005COLETU", "B001AK3S4Y", "B000VNMMR0", "B0000959N0", "B00005JMUA", "1558908846", "6305767866", "B001RIY4WE", "B0049IHX2C", "B000VI70QS", "B000EGDB10", "B002GSXKN8", "B00HZMZ2FE", "B0045HCJ9O", "B003QO8TOQ", "B00005JNJV", "B001451HX4", "B00I9TDMRM", "B0006GANOQ", "B00003CXSP", "6305428115", "B00016MSV2", "B00005JOC9", "B000TJBN80", "B009MO57H6", "B000O77SQS", "B0087ZG7HK", "B001OST0M6", "B005LAIHXQ", "B0002J4X1Q", "B0002V7OI8", "B0015XHP2C", "6304806434", "B000QXDED6", "B00005JL3K", "B008JFUPFI", "B003PIUINS", "0783225946", "0792839056", "B00005N7Z1", "B0006GAO6I", "B001DZOC6Y", "B00005JL78", "B001HN697M", "B00IJS2OXG", "B002NXSRVG", "B00008G8M5", "B00005JN0T", "B003XURDAY", "B000O77SRM", "B006VRRGNK", "B00F4FFO8E"], "bought_together": ["B001VLBDD0", "B00005N5S5"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001VLBDD0", "B00005N5S5", "B001FB55HQ", "B002JT6AO0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 115564}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 13.47, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00005JM0B", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5143TFPX8SL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "All on a single disc,The League of Extraordinary Gentlemenoffers two commentary tracks, 12 deleted and extended scenes, and a 54-minute documentary. The track by the two producers and three of the actors is informative, but surprisingly interesting is the track by the film's technicians, particularly costume designer Jacqueline West, whose passion for her craft is infectious.  Unfortunately, the film's two biggest selling points--thegraphic novelthat inspired it and the marquee star, Sean Connery--don't get sufficient attention.  The documentary acknowledges the graphic novel but doesn't really discuss it, concentrating on examinations of the costumes and special effects (e.g., Mr. Hyde was done without CGI).  Connery's involvement consists of a few sound bites at the beginning of some of the documentary chapters.  He and producer Don Murphy explain that he turned downThe Lord of the RingsandThe Matrixbecause he didn't understand them, but even though he wasn't sure he understoodLXG, he wasn't going to turn it down.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0002KVUKM", "B0009MDPYM", "B001AK3S4Y", "B001F7MSFM", "B00AEFXCLU", "B002GOAH1A", "B0006IIPIK", "B0000959N0", "6304711891", "B0007P0Y7C", "B003HKN52U", "B000FGGE68", "B003M987PQ", "B006VRRGNK", "B004EPZ07K", "1558908846", "B0002J4X1Q", "B001DHXT20", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B007K3JFUQ", "B008JFUS0U", "B002GHHHL0", "B000OVLBF8", "B00AEFYGBA", "B00005JNTU", "B001OQCV6A", "B000069I1I", "B001GCUO1Q", "B000ENC5YW", "B0006L0LOS", "B000VI70QS", "B00IKM5LXG", "B003Y5H5EW", "0800195175", "B0090SI56Y", "B00005JLQN", "B00070FX5U", "B005LAIH54", "B002A5EBMQ", "B000B8GT92", "B000MX7V70", "B0045HCJGC", "B000ASATYY", "B001CDR1FG", "B001GCUO0W", "B004LWZW42", "B001VLFE7G", "B004SEUIWY", "B003Q6D2B4", "B00004Z4WR", "B009MF5BXK", "B00151QYXU", "B00003CXSD", "B002GSXKNI", "B005LAIGW8", "B002ZG99KO", "B000035Z38", "0767834739", "B00005JN0T", "B002ZG999U", "B00E5I2MEK", "B00E5I2M9K", "B0013FDM7E", "B002ZG97CO", "B0002IQMAM", "B00BTYOYG2", "B008JFURII", "B008JFUO72", "B0013J55B6", "B001HQZJMU", "B000EQHXN2", "B000OVLBHG", "B009MO57H6", "B000AP04FG", "B00008K76U", "B000WC39LI", "6304712499", "B005LAIHYU", "B008JFUPPI", "B0016Q2D5M", "B00006JDVV", "B00111YM5G", "B00AEFZ6V4", "B000I0RQVI", "B000CEXGAU", "B000056PMU", "B001QTXM5Y", "B0000VJG72", "B005LAIH2C", "B00I9TDMRM", "B00005JM5E", "B00008EYA5", "B002ZG99G8", "B00007AJE1", "B000H30B2C", "B002NXSRVG", "B00195FUDC", "B001QB9H1U", "B0006GANOQ", "B001DJLD1M"], "bought_together": ["B0002KVUKM", "B0009MDPYM"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0002KVUKM", "B00005JLXE", "B001F7MSFM", "B002ZG98LO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 12054}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.68, "brand": "Twentieth Century Fox", "asin": "B00005JM5B", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51KDD84NPVL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (Widescreen Edition)"}

Not clothes or men or Anna's passion to be in a rock band. Nothing. Then one night a little mystic mayhem changes their lives and they wake up to the biggest freak-out ever.

{"description": "Even though it's only a single disc, the28 Days LaterDVD includes a lot of very interesting features, including the alternate ending that was shown after the end of the film a couple months into its theatrical run.  It's much bleaker, as director Danny Boyle and writer Alex Garland say in their optional commentary.  Another alternate ending is almost the same as the theatrical ending but slightly less happy.  Most interesting is the \"radical\" alternate ending that takes an entirely different path midway through the film.  It wasn't filmed, however, so Boyle and Garland narrate the action over storyboards, and it's a surprisingly engrossing 11 minutes.  Boyle and Garland also did a commentary track for the film, and they talk about how they were able to get the shots of deserted London and why they used the ending they did.  There are also six very watchable deleted scenes, and Boyle and Garland's comments range from \"great sequence\" to \"a disgrace.\" Slightly less relevant is a 24-minute documentary that spends its first 10 minutes on the real-life threat of infectious diseases before recapping the film and discussing such elements as the use of digital video and the boot camp the actors had to attend. If you need any further proof that the DVD was a labor of love, even the stills galleries have commentaries.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000TJBN80", "B0002ABURA", "B0006A9FKA", "B002WY65VU", "B00111YM5Q", "B0013D8LAE", "B000IHY9TS", "B000Y7U98C", "B00005JO16", "B0021L8UXA", "B0001611DI", "B0013D8LA4", "B000RJO56O", "B002JT69IW", "B001D2WU9I", "B002VWNIDG", "B0002CHK1S", "B00D7AM6M0", "B003UGLCIA", "B00AEFYYH6", "B001MVYUR0", "B000UAE7O0", "B003EYVXYG", "B000EHRVP6", "B0028DRGDQ", "B0021L8UPS", "B001NPD9LS", "B005LAIIMG", "B000FAOC2W", "B000LP6KNU", "B0006SSOHC", "B000WC3864", "B0013FDM7E", "B00000K3TO", "B000RIWAVW", "B000GCFO0I", "B000O76ZQC", "B004LWZW24", "B000RJO578", "B002VKB0KG", "B006ISJR7U", "B00004TS0G", "B004SIP9MY", "B002VKE1K2", "B00G5GNYY2", "B000N6TX1I", "B0024FADD8", "B005QUQRBU", "B001MYIXAC", "B00D3DJIG8", "B001GUYB08", "B000TGJ80S", "B000V4UFZK", "B004SIP92O", "B00009MGEM", "B0010X73ZG", "B00005K3NR", "B002LMSWN2", "B000063RQQ", "B00000ILDD", "B004BZ5AN2", "0767802519", "B00001QGUM", "B00AJLHUA8", "B002SJIO4A", "B00005JMUA", "B00J5LXT6M", "B005J9ZFQG", "B000QQJ3Q0", "B000AXWHSA", "B00BEIYMAG", "B00005JLWN", "B004BLJQOK", "B0015ET3YO", "B008220BLG", "B000031WD9", "B000069HZP", "B000EQ5SRK", "B0007Y08QA", "B000PMLJMQ", "B000BUNZY2", "B002ZG98UA", "B000V4UH08", "B001JNNDJM", "B003HKN52U", "B003UAKEBW", "B0007DFJ0G", "B0019X3YX2", "B00CE00ZV8", "B00003CXCF", "B0009WFEDC", "B000FS9FE4", "B00005JNJV", "B00011CZRE", "B002T9H2LA", "B000RW5BZ0", "B00005JMXX", "B000WC389G", "B007STBUHI", "B002ZG983M"], "bought_together": ["B000TJBN80", "B002WY65VU"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B008SAPC20", "B003J42JLC", "B000Y7U98C", "B0002ABURA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 37382}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.25, "brand": "Twentieth Century Fox", "asin": "B00005JMA8", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/511KHM89SFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "28 Days Later (Widescreen Special Edition)"}
{"description": "Like any DVD blockbuster from producer Jerry Bruckheimer, the extras are plentiful and often a bit too self-congratulatory (worst offender here is the primary commentary track). The slickly (natch) produced making-of documentary goes through the standard routine; however, the less-flashy \"fly on the wall\" bits--just showing what happens on set without comment--is more fun, offering effortless insight on the filmmaking process. The best treasure is a nifty interactive history on pirates with plenty of background material. You can simply play the filmed segments or take a tour around a ship to discover the material (and a few surprises). There's a lot of archival material on the theme-park ride that inspired the film and several odds and ends including an enjoyable chronicle of the vintage ship's voyage from its home harbor to the movie set. The kids should really dig the DVD-ROM \"Moonlight Becomes Ye,\" in which they can turn their own mug into a ghostly pirate. There's also a bounty of extended and deleted scenes (19 in all) and a very funny blooper reel. With both DTS and Dolby 5.1, sound systems will get a workout with the excellent (and loud) sound design.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000I0RQVI", "B000U7WV1Y", "B005COPWZW", "B004A8ZWUQ", "B00005JN5E", "B0013BM63O", "B006VRRGNK", "B00005JKZV", "B00005JPH2", "B0014Z4OMU", "B00E5I2MCM", "B00003CWT6", "B004DTLK80", "B00005JKZY", "B0000A1RJI", "B004M1A21K", "B004DTLK7G", "B00003CXZ1", "B001HN694K", "B001E75QH0", "B00E5I2M6I", "B00005JKCH", "B0087ZG7HK", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B000E6EK2Y", "B000E8M0VA", "B003UYUQZW", "B00AEFYGBA", "B000W746GK", "B00005JMQW", "B0083SBMBM", "B001DHXT20", "B0002234LS", "B000W7F5SS", "B002PMV9FG", "B0002KVUKM", "B004EPYZUS", "B0053FANRC", "B00BEZTMFY", "6304806434", "B000VR0570", "0783231644", "B001OQCV6A", "B000AYELVA", "B008JFUO72", "B005G4TJUC", "B00004R99S", "B00023B1LC", "B00E5I2M9K", "B00003CXI1", "B001HQZJMU", "B00000IRE6", "B0002ZDVEU", "B008QE9XD2", "B00F84H73Q", "B00E5I2MEK", "B003Y5H5EW", "B007K3JFUQ", "B003QO8TOQ", "B000NQRR1Q", "B000YPUF9W", "B001EZE5BU", "B004A8ZWSS", "B0009MDPYM", "B00LG6YEKE", "B002ZG980U", "B002ZG994U", "B000U1ZV8K", "B001DZ8TRW", "B00005JLR2", "B000VWYJ86", "B00AZMFJYA", "B001GZ6QC4", "B00000JQB5", "B004XKCZAG", "B000W796OM", "B001GCUO0W", "B00AQSN7HE", "B00000ILDH", "B0053FANT0", "B0000VAFO0", "B0002IQMAM", "B000HRMAPE", "B004LWZW7Y", "B008UZA8FY", "B0001HLVS2", "B00007AJGH", "B00005JNJV", "B003YAR97K", "B00CHVJODE", "B000UR9T8C", "B0049IHX2C", "B000G6BLW4", "B00177YA1K", "0783227345", "B0014Z4ON4", "B001TK80C0", "B002O5M4T4", "B00AEBBA72", "B00005JOC9"], "bought_together": ["B000I0RQVI", "B000U7WV1Y"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005COPWZW", "B000I0RQVI", "B0071JADFU", "B00005JPFX"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 6260}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.23, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B00005JM5E", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51fX40gGdXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)"}

{"description": "The supplemental features ofFahrenheit 9/11offer almost an hour and a half of further manna for Michael Moore's supporters and ammunition for his critics, including appearances by two of the most memorable figures in the film, Michigan mother Lila Lipscomb and Marine corporal Abdul Henderson.  \"The Release ofFahrenheit 9/11\" (11 minutes) collects reactions to the film from celebrities, political leaders, and Quentin Tarantino and Tilda Swinton of the 2004 Cannes Film Festival jury (but no film critics).  Lipscomb gives a moving speech at the film's Washington, D.C. premiere (4 minutes), and in an 18-minute sequence, an embedded Swedish journalist recounts his experiences, accompanied by footage of U.S. soldiers raiding an Iraqi home.  This provides the context for the scene in the main film in which a soldier gets his picture taken with a bound and hooded Iraqi, which is chillingly similar to the infamous pictures from Abu Ghraib prison.  The second part of the DVD features consists of seven new or extended scenes (about 50 minutes total), including more footage of Iraq before the invasion; protesters outside Abu Ghraib and former prisoners showing their injuries; more thoughts from Cpl. Abdul Henderson; National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice trying to squirm off the hook in front of the 9/11 Commission; and President Bush going through the motions of a press appearance after he appeared before the same commission.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000UNYJXQ", "B0030Y11XS", "B00008DDVV", "B00009YXAS", "B00008K76O", "B0030Y11O2", "B0002RQ2Q2", "B001G43C1S", "B00008L3TE", "B0041KKYBA", "B00068VAOG", "B000T28C5Y", "B000ICL3KG", "B000BTH4K4", "B002FOQY7M", "B0002OXVBO", "B001NMT8R0", "B001MFNB5I", "B001MVWFAO", "0743272927", "B000FBH3W2", "B0007DBJM8", "B000UYX4N6", "B0027BOL4G", "B000U6YJMO", "B00G0PXU2Y", "B00005JPXA", "B000GYHRHO", "B002EP8TQG", "B000C3L2IO", "B000JVSUSE", "B004EPYZDA", "B0016N52IK", "B001BEK8FQ", "B0041KKYBK", "B00KY6YAO2", "B00F12IRSO", "B00DYC648S", "B001F5274G", "B0001L3LUE", "B000HWXOT0", "B005FITIGO", "B003CJXJ8Q", "B0013D8LHM", "B00DPUB5LK", "044653224X", "B005KBJC0I", "B004FQX59I", "B00KUS5YGC", "B007KAUWO2", "B00GYG8BKK", "B000093NQZ", "B001P9G3HE", "B00483VQTE", "B003Q6D28C", "B001B7CNW4", "B000BBOUHM", "B00744WZ8U", "B00066VTBW", "B001KWB0L0", "B00443YDWK", "B000059TG8", "B000JLTRIQ", "B003JUINFM", "0060392452", "B000I5Y8FU", "B000BITURA", "B003XKNGLY", "B004EPYZDK", "B003M987AG", "B000PY52IG", "B006ML50QK", "B000QGE89W", "B00EK52XQK", "B00DENQEE6", "B000GH3CR0", "B0047UJBP4", "B00005J75F", "0446693790", "B0006N2DSI", "B001AEF6HM", "B00005JLYW", "B001J66JQI", "B000O0YV7O", "B002NPCJRC", "B00AZMFG48", "B0042KZJIC", "B00827OX5Q", "B0002HDXTQ", "B001E5FYS8", "B00AEBB89C", "B003H23KSM", "B000CEXEWA", "0615602223", "B006JN86VW", "B00914YLAG", "B0001IXT36", "B008PUI1GM", "B004SIP7ZS"], "bought_together": ["B000UNYJXQ", "B0030Y11XS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000UNYJXQ", "B0030Y11XS", "B00008DDVV", "B0002OXVBO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 44430}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.0, "brand": "From HIBISCUS EXPRESS, http://www.amazon.com/shops/AXD9LOVGJXES3", "asin": "B00005JNEI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51KDRVF1JGL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Fahrenheit 9/11"}
{"description": "Despite super effects, a huge budget, and the cinematic pedigree of alien-happy Steven Spielberg, this take on H.G. Wells's novel is basically a horror film packaged as a sci-fi thrill ride. Instead of a mad slasher, however, Spielberg (along with writers Josh Friedman & David Koepp) utilizes aliens hell-bent on quickly destroying humanity, and the terrifying results that prey upon adult fears, especially in the post-9/11 world. The realistic results could be a new genre, the grim popcorn thriller; often you feel like you're watching Schindler's List more than Spielberg's other thrill-machine movies (Jaws,Jurassic Park). The film centers on Ray Ferrier, a divorced father (Tom Cruise, oh so comfortable) who witnesses one giant craft destroy his New Jersey town and soon is on the road with his teen son (Justin Chatwin) and preteen daughter (Dakota Fanning) in tow, trying to keep ahead of the invasion. The film is, of course, impeccably designed and produced by Spielberg's usual crew of A-class talent. The aliens are genuinely scary, even when the film--like the novel--spends a good chunk of time in a basement. Readers of the book (or viewers of the deft 1953 adaptation) will note the variation of whom and how the aliens come to Earth, which poses some logistical problems. The film opens and closes with narration from the novel read by Morgan Freeman, but Spielberg could have adapted Orson Welles's words from the famous Halloween Eve 1938 radio broadcast: \"We couldn't soap all your windows and steal all your garden gates by tomorrow night, so we did the best next thing: we annihilated the world.\"--Doug ThomasWar of the Worldsat Amazon.comThe SoundtrackThe War of the Worlds(1953)War of the Worlds - The Complete First Season(TV series)Classic Sci-Fi Movies and Their RemakesAliens Invade on DVDThe Prog-rock Opera (no kidding)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEBB8VK", "B00005JL78", "B001SGEUYW", "B00008G8M4", "B00005JL3T", "B0013FDM7E", "B00AEFXNLY", "B00005JMXX", "B001OQCV2E", "B000VECAD0", "B002O3Z510", "B0002V7OI8", "B000H30B2C", "B000EGDB10", "B00005JN2Z", "B005LAIIMG", "B005PTYP70", "B002O3Z50G", "B0002V7ON8", "B00005JN0T", "B00K2CHW48", "B002SJIO4A", "0783225547", "B008JFUO36", "B00005JKLZ", "B00AS1Q93S", "1936594056", "B004EPYZUS", "B001TUZG4K", "B00AEFXR1K", "B00001ZWUS", "B00AEFXYJA", "0767817478", "B0034G4ORC", "B003QO8TOQ", "B00070FX5U", "B0045HCJSA", "B00000G3PA", "B005LAIHPE", "B003Y5H5GK", "B00AEBBA72", "B00003CWU3", "B00I9TDMRM", "B001ECDVKE", "B00003CXXP", "B000V4UFZK", "B0010X73ZG", "B001DZOC6Y", "B00005JKFR", "B000XT1P4S", "B003HKN52U", "B0009PW4D2", "B000HRMAPE", "B004EPYZPS", "B0018QPPXW", "B0002WZTOI", "B00AEBB9LO", "B004LWZW4M", "B003ABZHAO", "B003YJFALS", "B0087ZG7HK", "B000OT6V64", "B004P7CN7W", "B000CCBC9O", "B00000ILDD", "0767803434", "B001L57ZYM", "B000065V3G", "B007STBUHI", "B002ZG980U", "B008JFUQZ2", "B00005B6JZ", "B0006GANOQ", "B000F1IQN2", "1494343576", "B001GCUO02", "B00004Y87O", "0783226810", "B004EPYZSK", "B000P0J0BU", "B005LAIHXQ", "B001680M26", "B000EQHXN2", "B0045HCJFS", "B00004BZIY", "B00008G8M5", "B00003CXQA", "B008JFUS0U", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00EIN6KJ0", "B0000DZ6N3", "B000MV8A9A", "B00005JKYX", "B0000YEEGM", "B000TGJ8CQ", "B0013FCWUW", "B002ZG9864", "B00003CWTI", "B008MIMWQW", "B00IKM5OCO"], "bought_together": ["B00AEBB8VK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AEBB8VK", "B004LWZW4M", "B00005JL78", "B004EPYZSK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 18739}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.95, "brand": "Dreamworks Skg", "asin": "B00005JNTI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51upxzPRnXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "War of the Worlds"}

{"description": "The supercharged possibilities of a single set and two amped-up actors are explored inHard Candy, a twisted cocktail with a poison kicker. After a flirtatious encounter in an online chat room, two people agree to meet for coffee:  a 32-year-old man (Patrick Wilson) and a 14-year-old girl (Ellen Page). They quickly advance to his house, and just as quickly, the apparent pedophilic seduction morphs into something else entirely. After the tables turn,Hard Candybecomes a tale of revenge and torture that might have tempted a filmmaker like Park Chanwook. Here, first-time feature director David Slade opts for a slick look that stays close to the actors, and you can't really blame him--this movie is like a conceptual, more-than-slightly unbelievable off-Broadway play, a showcase for actors and \"controversial\" ideas. Those actors are strong:  Patrick Wilson (Angels in America,Phantom of the Opera) is every bit as creepy as he needs to be, and Ellen Page has nothing short of a triumph. The Canadian actress was around 18 when she shot the film, but looks like an adolescent, which makes her authoritative wrath all the more shocking to witness. The provocations ofHard Candysometimes seem arbitrary or forced, but Page's electrifying performance can't be denied, or dismissed.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0017VG5XM", "B00177YA6U", "B002VPTJOA", "B000ARFPMQ", "B004U7MR3W", "B0037E8HOC", "B00DVD5STQ", "B000YABYLA", "B00187FPC2", "B001MEJY8W", "B000WC38EQ", "B0013D8L7M", "B002EOVXBK", "B000FVQM2Y", "B000UCD4L0", "B00009MEC4", "B0051PLQR0", "6305313687", "B001G9CNI6", "B005Z9MGRG", "B003U6SJY0", "B008NNY8XQ", "B00125WATQ", "B0014VPFVS", "B00006AUIG", "B00DMUFXOS", "B001J4E19C", "B002VPTJNQ", "B00000I1KK", "B003L20IEC", "B004OUZLGK", "B000N3SU92", "B00699G622", "B00005Q4CS", "B0057ZAA6W", "B00005JMJG", "B008G1JIQC", "B0021L8UPS", "B00441GYVK", "B0007PID84", "B000NO39FG", "B00B96TGQS", "B001B187L6", "B000OYCMLM", "B005SQRYB4", "B0000AOX0A", "B000A2X3U2", "B00G5GNYY2", "B008G33PIM", "B0020LH8WU", "6305428484", "B000MMMTBY", "B002LMSWN2", "B007CZ3E7C", "B002USF1WC", "B004SIP9Z6", "B00005U14H", "0767802519", "B00AEFY2AA", "B0001GF2D8", "B001D2WU9I", "B00009W0U4", "B0000694XX", "B004LWZW24", "B0083QN87K", "B004Z1HY2W", "B000HC2LFI", "B0002J4X1Q", "B0000CABGW", "B007L6VRBM", "B0001EFUFK", "B003626TNG", "B009XTF8KQ", "B00ELQHX5O", "B007UW9W8W", "B001JNNDJM", "157362408X", "B0058ZPNOK", "B000EOTVU2", "B0082CWTSY", "B00AZTUUQK", "B001C5LLVE", "B000PKG8TM", "B00003CWQR", "B00007976U", "B001CDFY64", "B004XVMCH6", "B00003CWN3", "B0028DRGDQ", "B000FS2W3A", "B001U0HBQA", "B000N3AW6G", "B00005QAOZ", "B00BSU0FQA", "B00003CXKM", "B0002MPQRS", "B00BEIYGT8", "B0004Z31OS", "B001AZKB8K"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002VPTJOA", "B00177YA6U", "B001MEJY8W", "B0017VG5XM"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 421858}, "asin": "B00005JP3W", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51FEBBE1B9L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Hard Candy"}

{"description": "Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's Endis a rollicking voyage in the same spirit of the two earlierPiratesfilms, yet far darker in spots (and nearly three hours to boot). The action, largely revolving around a pirate alliance against the ruthless East India Trading Company, doesn't disappoint, though the violence is probably too harsh for young children. Through it all, the plucky cast (Keira Knightley, Orlando Bloom, Geoffrey Rush) are buffeted by battle, maelstroms, betrayal, treachery, a ferocious Caribbean weather goddess, and that gnarly voyage back from the world's end--but with their wit intact. As always, Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow tosses off great lines ; he chastises \"a woman scorned, like which hell hath no fury than!\" He insults an opponent with a string of epithets, ending in \"yeasty codpiece.\"!In the previousThe Curse of the Black Pearl, Sparrow was killed--sent to Davy Jones' Locker. In the opening scenes, the viewer sees that death has  not been kind to Sparrow--but that's not to say he hasn't found endless ways to amuse himself, cavorting with dozens of hallucinated versions of himself on the deck of the Black Pearl. But Sparrow is needed in this world, so a daring rescue brings him back. Keith Richards' much ballyhooed appearance as Jack's dad is little more than a cameo, though he does play a wistful guitar. But the action, as always, is more than satisfying, held together by Depp, who, outsmarting the far-better-armed British yet again, causes a bewigged commander to muse: \"Do you think he plans it all out, or just makes it up as he goes along?\" As far as fans are concerned, it matters not.--A.T. HurleyOn the DVDHere's something you can't say about just any DVD extras: There appears to bemoreof Keith Richards in the outtakes, interviews, and other special features on theAt World's Enddisc than in the actual film. For those scenes alone, this special edition is well worth the price. Richards looks as woozy and gamey as all the rumors suggested, and answers questions he's not asked, with Johnny Depp sitting next to him, almost acting as a translator. Richards offers pithy comments like, \"Everything I do is original, you better believe,\" and smiles when other cast members call him \"Two-Take Richards\" for supposedly nailing his scenes.The packed second disc also includes a terrific mini-doc on how the filmmakers created the famous maelstrom, in an enormous hanger in Palmdale, California, with the ships floating 30 feet off the ground. \"Just moving theBlack Pearlwas an enormous undertaking,\" says producer Jerry Bruckheimer with serious understatement. Other cool extras include \"Tale of the Many Jacks,\" deleted scenes with great commentary, \"The World of Chow Yun-Fat,\" a bio of composer Hans Zimmer, features on the set designers, a look at the impressive Brethren Court, and some hilarious bloopers. \"You can't curse in a Disney film,\" deadpans Depp when a costar blurts out something blue. \"See? I told him.\" The extras are truly as much of a rollicking adventure as the film.--A.T.

{"description": "Edith Piaf is the subject ofLa Vie en Rose, director Olivier Dahan's powerful if emotionally redundant biographical film about the iconic French superstar whose life, as depicted here, seems to have been a numbing succession of tragedies interrupted on occasion by artistic triumph. Dahan's portrait begins with Piaf's stay in a brothel as a young girl. Left to the care of her grandmother (who runs the place) after her father pulls her away from a narcissistic mother, Piaf undergoes significant health problems and grows up to sing on the street in lieu of outright prostitution. The film pulses along with the usual biopic rhythms, with pivotal moments in the life of Piaf (played as an adult by Marion Cotillard) turning up regularly only to be smacked aside by the unseen hand of perpetual misfortune. There's the impresario (Gerard Depardieu) who recognizes Piaf's great but raw talent only to have a run-in with the criminal element around her. There's the heavyweight fighter (Marcel Cerdan) who becomes the love of Piaf's life but can't be with her. Drug addiction, random car accidents, tax problems, you name it, it's all here, topped by an unnerving revelation that pops up inLa Vie en Rose's final moments. After awhile, with such a concentration of bad news squeezed into 140 minutes, one begins to wish Dahan had taken a more expansive approach to Piaf's life and times. But the film is never less than interesting, and the lead performance by Cotillard is often astonishing.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002LE8MGW", "B004SEUIXS", "B000UVV26A", "B001CIOCLC", "B000002UYD", "B002VKB0M4", "B000YPUFBA", "B002AG2NTI", "B0007Z0NYQ", "B0087IT8FK", "B000MEYIBG", "B0009P7EI2", "B004WDZR0O", "B00279MJHE", "0307268012", "B0069UV0AY", "B001THZAAI", "B005MYEQ4U", "B000002TMF", "B000LXH10I", "B00421IR5I", "B0000C9JFO", "B007I1Q59E", "B00AZNEVNE", "B000I6BJ56", "B000811672", "B00007J5VT", "B008H1Q3QY", "B0002S64SM", "B003L20III", "B00782O7IY", "1613743920", "B005V4X8PO", "B0007A61K6", "B0030MD5TS", "B0019UGYAU", "B0000YEENU", "B0084O26SI", "B004B3254Q", "B0001Y4JO8", "B004ZBFRRG", "B006KDHJMS", "B00A92MEJY", "B000UAE7MM", "B009CSVQ8Q", "B000SAAT76", "B00008979K", "B000CSUNRU", "B000YAA68W", "B004SIP6BI", "B0041KKYF6", "B002QQ8HAG", "B00005JM48", "B00007L4I6", "B000934FC2", "B005CKW8BM", "B004YCKKIM", "B002ONC9NC", "B001AZJKKK", "B0012EI8ES", "B009B8YMB0", "B000053VBN", "B0002V7TI8", "B004UXUUDA", "B008CJ0JS4", "B001DZA3W6", "B0031REQKE", "B000LXHK2C", "B005HISOJ4", "B000B58DHQ", "B000296E7W", "0792833279", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B005CU5OF4", "B0000A1HQP", "B00ENMZK1A", "B00166UFTS", "B000053VBP", "B00CDV4PPK", "B00005AUK9", "B004XVMCMG", "B00005NC66", "B00008G7UF", "B0031SU2Y2", "B00000AVEO", "B000M06KJ8", "B00ANQHR7U", "B004NWPY3E", "B001C71IEM", "B006OB3JVQ", "B00G15MDI0", "B001KVZ6AM", "B0036TGSJE", "B001O549EI", "B0045NXMJE", "B000SSQ7JC", "B004ZG5EYC", "B00000K3TS"], "bought_together": ["B002LE8MGW", "B001CIOCLC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005MYEQ4U", "B002LE8MGW", "B004SEUIXS", "B000UVV26A"]}, "price": 11.14, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 9014}, "asin": "B00005JPX8", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ylggkac7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "La Vie en Rose (Extended Version)"}
{"description": "For anyone who thought the Oscar-winning documentaryMarch of the Penguinswas the most marvelous cinematic moment for these nomads of the south, you haven't seen nothing yet.Happy Feetis an animated wonder about a penguin named Mumble who can't sing, but can dance up a storm. George Miller, the driving force behind theBabe(andMad Max) movies, takes another creative step in family entertainment with this big, beautiful, music-fueled film that will have kids and their parents dancing in the streets. From his first moment alive, Mumble (voiced Elijah Woods) feels the beat and can't stop dancing. Unfortunately, emperor penguins are all about finding their own heart song, and the dancing youngster--as cute as he is--is a misfit. Luckily, he bumps into little blue penguins and a Spanish-infused group (led by Robin Williams) and begins a series of adventures. Miller has an exceptional variety of entertainment: Busby Berkley musical numbers, amusement-park thrills, exciting chase sequences (seals and orca lovers might like think otherwise), and even an environmental message that doesn't weigh you down. Best of all, you don't know where the movie is going in the last act, a rare occurrence these days in family entertainment. A fusion of rock songs, mashed-up and otherwise, are featured; this movie is as much a musical as a comedy. Mumble's solo dance to a new version of Stevie Wonder's \"I Wish\" by Fantasia, Patti, and Yolanda may be the most joyful moment on camera in 2006.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0006UEVT0", "B001DPHDCY", "B0006JMLRK", "B0012EM5D8", "B004HO6I4M", "B004EPZ0AC", "B002WJI2QQ", "B000AY74OG", "B0000AOX0O", "B00BG0RSJ4", "B00005JNQS", "B000RMJ4F8", "B0000640SC", "B005SDUV4E", "0783231474", "B00003CXJ4", "B00CWM58WY", "B0000VV4W2", "B0042U94UQ", "B0039N74CW", "6305161887", "B00AEFXMSS", "B000M343BC", "B00007LVCM", "B001ECQ75A", "B00005JNS0", "B00000JL8E", "B000GUJZ00", "B000056H26", "B008NNY9QW", "B004EPZ034", "B00G5G7EXY", "B000LPS2VI", "B005LAIH4A", "B00F522C7C", "B005LAIISA", "B00GDT5T9Y", "B007FF3HQM", "B000VBJEEG", "B003H9M1Q2", "B00029LO0Y", "B008JFUQ16", "B00005JMQZ", "B00EV1YZ96", "B000ION23A", "B0013FSL3E", "B003ZHVJGO", "B002ZG97YM", "B001NCDFTW", "B004G600A4", "B00009YXAW", "B005LAIHW2", "B00AFEX83C", "B00475B0H6", "B000UVKGPI", "B00ALMNCLQ", "B00HLTD2OE", "B00005JM7T", "B001HN6922", "B000BI5KV0", "B0013FSWT2", "B0030IIZ4M", "B004ODLUGM", "B001GCUO7A", "B005F96UJ6", "B000UFIYOO", "B000G75AZC", "B00005QFE1", "B0000VCZKW", "B00IEXX4KS", "B001THIQFO", "B000A2WAQK", "B001GCUNWQ", "B00B7EQPNE", "B002NZK5SW", "B0007PIDBQ", "B00AOCDDGC", "B000V5IP6U", "B0044RFTD8", "B00AEFXMGU", "B001KVZ6FW", "B00CHVJODE", "B000CZ0PT4", "B006JD48LO", "B0007Z0NYG", "B00EBBGLFC", "B00003CXB4", "B000BMGEJI", "B008YWY0HK", "B0002YLCOM", "B00E9ZATJO", "B004A8ZX3C", "B00I6JOD2S", "B005G3VCYY", "B00CQRN3QI", "B004OWQTZ0", "B0001OGUQI", "B004EPZ01G", "B00005JMFH", "B000GIXEWC"], "bought_together": ["B004HO6I4M"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004HO6I4M", "B00EBBGLFC", "B00G5G7EXY", "B00HR3D56O"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 21763}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.51, "brand": "Warner", "asin": "B00005JPCF", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51sX2Hrdz6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Happy Feet (Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "The Dark Knightarrives with tremendous hype (best superhero movie ever? posthumous Oscar for Heath Ledger?), and incredibly, it lives up to all of it.  But calling it the best superhero movie ever seems like faint praise, since part of what makes the movie great--in addition to pitch-perfect casting, outstanding writing, and a compelling vision--is that it bypasses the normal fantasy element of the superhero genre and makes it all terrifyingly real.  Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) is Gotham City's new district attorney, charged with cleaning up the crime rings that have paralyzed the city. He enters an uneasy alliance with the young police lieutenant, Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman), and Batman (Christian Bale), the caped vigilante who seems to trust only Gordon--and whom only Gordon seems to trust. They make progress until a psychotic and deadly new player enters the game: the Joker (Heath Ledger), who offers the crime bosses a solution--kill the Batman. Further complicating matters is that Dent is now dating Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal, after Katie Holmes turned down the chance to reprise her role), the longtime love of Batman's alter ego, Bruce Wayne.In his last completed role before his tragic death, Ledger is fantastic as the Joker, a volcanic, truly frightening force of evil. And he sets the tone of the movie: the world is a dark, dangerous place where there are no easy choices.  Eckhart and Oldman also shine, but as good as Bale is, his character turns out rather bland in comparison (not uncommon for heroes facing more colorful villains). Director-cowriter Christopher Nolan (Memento) follows his critically acclaimedBatman Beginswith an even better sequel that sets itself apart from notable superhero movies likeSpider-Man 2andIron Manbecause of its sheer emotional impact and striking sense of realism--there are no suspension-of-disbelief superpowers here. At 152 minutes, it's a shade too long, and it's much too intense for kids. But for most movie fans--and not just superhero fans--The Dark Knightis a film for the ages.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B00DUCXFUC", "B004LWZWGK", "B000PC6A3E", "B002ZG981E", "B00G4RD4PQ", "B0039208QM", "B001GMALGY", "B00E2Y0YBK", "B00C2IGQBA", "B0039208JE", "B00H14WTLQ", "B0039208CG", "B0085D3I3K", "B0039208C6", "B000M5AJQI", "B00319ECGK", "B001FB55H6", "B00EIG5M5A", "7020070078", "B00E2Y6AUY", "B00D5FMGGS", "B001OQCV6K", "B0013FBS20", "B000Q6GX5Y", "B001GKJ2FC", "B00FPS79F6", "B001992NUQ", "B004JMSIRC", "B001RIY4WE", "B00DYEN6XC", "B008QZ5PY2", "B001F7MSG6", "B00FAHYNWE", "B00J7PRJXU", "B001AQT0Z4", "B001UV4XEW", "B0083SBJXS", "B00AEFY552", "B00C8RD79O", "B007KAJG3K", "B007L4HET8", "B004EPZ07U", "B007L4HFDI", "B00AEFXKOO", "B000PC0U1W", "B00C6B8TB8", "B00HINFI4K", "B003TT2X6I", "B001KZIRM2", "B002ZG99NG", "B00EZ4M68G", "B004SIP90G", "B003ZHR6RK", "B001GCUO16", "B003TT2X6S", "B00JNEWSLS", "B001F3FUK6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00DUCXFUC", "B004LWZWGK", "B002ZG981E", "B000PC6A3E"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "asin": "B00005JPY0", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51pGxSkkz4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Dark Knight [Theatrical Release]"}

{"description": "The Dish, a good-natured and effortlessly funny Australian drama-comedy directed by Rob Sitch (The Castle), is filled with warm-hearted characters and has a factual hook that's irresistibly inspiring. This cumulative goodwill springs forth from the rural town of Parkes in New South Wales, where a 1,000-ton radio observatory dish is recruited to relay telemetry, voice, and television signals from the historicApollo 11moon landing in July 1969. To make sure the dish delivers Neil Armstrong's \"giant leap for mankind\" to 600 million eager viewers, site director Cliff Buxton (Sam Neill, at his gentle best) relies on a three-man crew consisting of an American NASA watchdog (Patrick Warburton, resembling a bearish Clark Kent), a sarcastic engineer (Kevin Harrington), and a lovestruck math whiz (Tom Long) who's pining for the sister of the dish's rather dimly overzealous security guard (Taylor Kane).Numerous other supporting characters add color to the proceedings, and crises arise (albeit briefly) when power outage, signal loss, and windstorms threaten to spoil Parkes's proudest hour. It all rates a bit high on the cuteness meter, butThe Dishis so smoothly amusing that you won't object to its eagerness to please. By focusing on the Aussie locals, the film reminds us that the moon landing was an occasion of global unity, and pride in all humanity is reflected in the wondrous smiles of Cliff, his crew, and the citizens of Parkes. That they played such a small but pivotal role in this historical milestone is just one of many joys to be discovered in this delightful little movie.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00001U0DW", "B00005JLD4", "B0006FYOTC", "B000NJL4QC", "0783225733", "B004SIPAJG", "B0007ZEOPK", "B00000K3CS", "B00049QJ9I", "B001CDR1F6", "B00JAQJMJ0", "0767812166", "B004SIP8WU", "B002EAYDUC", "B000294TC4", "B0001DCYUU", "B00005JMYC", "B00BTYJYR6", "B005A1GRSI", "B000MX7V3Y", "B0002V7S34", "B00B4804LM", "B008LFYZAM", "B00H83EUQW", "B0045HCJKS"], "bought_together": ["B00001U0DW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00A33J8YS", "B00001U0DW", "B00BTYJYR6", "B000XJ5TPE"]}, "price": 41.25, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 41306}, "asin": "B00005MKKS", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51PEGZKY64L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Dish"}

When beautiful but reclusive goth teenager Ginger (Katharine Isabelle) is attacked by a monstrous wolf on the eve of her first period, her body starts changing in a big way, as do her suddenly lusty, feral appetites. Director John Fawcett masterfully balances the expectations of teen horror exploitation (blood, bodies, sex, smart dialogue, and good old-fashioned monster-movie scares) with clever black humor and tender sisterly solidarity. Only devoted sister Brigitte (gloomy Emily Perkins) knows the truth, and even as Ginger's abrupt transformation threatens their once unbreakable friendship, bonds of blood and love keep them together: Brigitte disposes of Ginger's victims while searching for a cure. Mimi Rogers costars as their dotty but unexpectedly sensitive mom, ready to sacrifice all to protect her daughter.

{"description": "\"Dark Days\" is the multi-award winning documentary from Marc Singer about a community of homeless people living in a train tunnel beneath Manhattan. The film depicts a way of life that is unimaginable to most of those who walk the streets above. In the pitch black of the tunnel, rats swarm through piles of garbage as high-speed trains leaving Penn Station tear through the darkness. For some of those who have gone underground, it has been home for as long as twenty-five years. The director abandoned life on the outside to spend all of his time in the tunnels, making it his home for two years.

{"description": "When a series of bizarre thefts at a boarding house leads to murder, it takes Hercule Poirot all of his ingenuity to solve a series of interlocking mysteries and unmask the killer. This feature-length Poirot mystery shows why David Suchet is the definitive screen version of Agatha Christie's dapper Belgian sleuth. With his fastidious habits and thick French accent it would be easy to turn Poirot into a caricature, but Suchet makes him funny without diminishing the detective's brilliance. Poirot's peculiarity is a perfect disguise, and when he sets out for the murder scene in his immaculate clothes--like a shiny black beetle bustling through the drab, brown London streets--there is little doubt that the crime will soon be solved.Hickory Dickory Dockreaches its climax,naturellement, with the detective and his suspects gathered tensely in a drawing room. Although the story suffers from some clumsily introduced clues (Christie suffers here in comparison with writers like P.D. James), the denouement works well, keeping us guessing while allowing the more astute viewer to spot the killer before Poirot makes his announcement.--Simon Leake", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005RIX1", "B00005MM5G", "B00005BGSC", "B000056C0I", "B00005KH4B", "B005X5XINI", "1569383618", "B00005MM5H", "0767028627", "B001V7YZAM", "B007ISJS0U", "B004WMOSNM", "B000CRR3EC", "B001V7YZA2", "B00007KK42", "1569383626", "B000056C0O", "B0006HBJJ8", "B000068QOB", "B00008G8C1", "B000CBRFT6", "B000068QJV", "B000068QJU", "B001RPPJSK", "B000M1LYIY", "B001RPO3FU", "B001RPWUTG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["1569383618", "B00005MM5H", "B00005RIX1", "1569383626"]}, "price": 49.95, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 279626}, "asin": "B00005RIWY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/519SQ2J9BRL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Poirot - Hickory Dickory Dock"}

{"description": "You're not going to believe this, butReturn of the Killer Tomatoesis a genuinely funny movie. Ten years after John DeBello made the frowzy, low-budgetAttack of the Killer Tomatoes, he brought the fleshy fruit back for a murderous encore. Like the first film, it works as a parody of horror-movie conventions (and it repeatedly makes fun of itself, Mad-magazine style), but this time the budget is higher. There's a great, ongoing send-up of product placement, plus a juicy role for the oft-underutilized John Astin, as the evil genius this kind of movie needs. Just to keep everything moving, another exploitation film keeps cutting in:Big-Breasted Girls Go to the Beach and Take Their Tops Off. It ain't high art, but this movie knows its audience.

{"description": "The 1985 seriesTatakae Cho Robot Seimetai Transformers(\"Fight Super Living Robots Transformers\") was a U.S.-Japanese coproduction, written in America and animated in Japan. Based on a line of robot toys from Takara--licensed to Hasbro in America--that could be reconfigured into cars, trucks, planes, etc., it spawned numerous sequels and a feature. Civil war rages on the planet Cybertron between the virtuous Autobots and the evil Decepticons. Both sides launch crews into space to find new energy sources, but the ships crash on Earth and are buried in lava. When the robots awaken four million years later, the Decepticons, led by the dictatorial Megatron, want to drain the planet of its resources, enslaving or destroying mankind. The Autobots ally with humanity and befriend oil-rig worker Spike Witwicky. The Saturday morning-style cheat of cutting to a logo, rather than animating transitions, and the frequent pauses for commercial breaks make for very choppy storytelling. The designs of the robots are interesting but lack the graphic sophistication of Yoshiyuki Tomino'sGundamMobile Suits. The animation is very limited, and the choreography of the battle sequences lacks the panache of Tomino and other more talented directors. LikeRobotech,Transformerswill appeal most strongly to adults who watched the show as kids: it's remained popular through Web sites, role-playing games, fan fiction, and a lively trade in the original toys. Serious students of anime will find this early series of historic interest. Unrated; suitable for age 6 and up: Robot vs. robot violence.--Charles Solomon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00006L9PL", "B00008RH31", "B0000C89IP", "B0001GOH8E", "B0031L5CJE", "B0029PUUSQ", "B000H6SY5K", "B00014NECG", "B0000AGQ3M", "B000SM7R2O", "B00028HBNO", "B005BUA1H6", "B001N6FPQY", "B00HRUQAKU", "B000EHSVM8", "B000EHSVKK", "B002NN7EX8", "B007C8RZL0", "B00AQ590IC", "B0056GLNQI", "B000HC2LRG", "B000A88EU0", "B000NQRV80", "B0055UA1KO", "B001BN25VW", "B000AJJNI6", "B000EHSVLY", "B0058JEHSO", "B002TMI2A2", "B0000AKY3Q", "B0002LE9FE", "B0007RT9MG", "B000I0QLR8", "B000GPIPTM", "B000I0QLS2", "B005335K7W", "B0087AOYCU", "B002DH20Q0", "B00005JN0T", "B00005NG69", "B00005MEUW", "B007KFZ85K", "B000J3FBUM", "B00005BJEF", "B001OMZYHC", "B00001U0DX", "B0023S4A26", "B000063K16", "B00007KK2K", "B001EJQ2DA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001SLNPTI", "B004NJC0JI", "B00008RH31", "B002NN7EX8"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 159116}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 74.95, "brand": "Transformers", "asin": "B000063K17", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/419VS60KYBL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Transformers: Season 1 (Collector's Edition)"}

{"description": "Josh Groban in Concerthas all the ingredients to be a long-running PBS staple: a young (21), good-looking performer with a golden voice; songs in Italian and Spanish for the crossover crowd (i.e.,Andrea BocelliandSarah Brightman) and pop and movie songs for the mainstream crowd; guest stars galore (David Foster, John Williams, Angie Stone, Andrea Corr, Lili Haydn); a large orchestra; and striking but not obtrusive visual effects. The centerpiece of this DVD/CD combo (also available in aCD jewel case) is the 80-minute concert DVD, filmed in Pasadena, California, in October 2002 and featuring numerous songs from Groban'sdebut CD, including \"You're Still You,\" which catapulted him into stardom when he sang it onAlly McBeal. There are also two new songs--the ballad \"Broken Vow\" accompanied by Foster, and \"For Always,\" with the orchestra conducted by John Williams, who wrote the song for the Steven Spielberg filmA.I.The 37-minute CD offers seven songs performed in the concert (including the two not on the previous CD, \"Broken Vow\" and \"For Always\"), plus \"O Holy Night.\" The DVD has excellent picture and sound (PCM stereo, Dolby Digital 5.1, and DTS), interviews, and backstage footage, and the combination with the CD is an excellent value.

{"description": "Trouble in Paradiseis the supreme example of \"the Lubitsch touch,\" that mastery of comic timing, diamond-cutter precision, and Continental sophistication that made Ernst Lubitsch a household name and the real star of every movie he directed. A pair of prodigiously talented, utterly charming scoundrels (Herbert Marshall, Miriam Hopkins) become personal assistants to an aristocratic Parisian widow (Kay Francis). Their target is her fortune, but she's such an elegant lady, and so agreeably smitten with her new right-hand man, that he's tempted to pursue a secondary objective. Marshall, Hopkins, and Francis aren't remembered as major stars, but in this enchanted moment they are sublime. Likewise the peerlessly pixilated Edward Everett Horton and Charlie Ruggles as the widow's stuffed-shirt suitors.Trouble in Paradiseis one of the best comedies ever made. There's not a line, word, or pause that doesn't belong exactly where it is, when it is, as it is.--Richard T.

The character of Barnabas Collins, a guilt-ridden 175 year-old vampire, brought the show tremendous success.Barnabas' secret is threatened by David Collins' curiosity. Anxious to become human again, Barnabas orders Dr. Julia Hoffman to accelerate her treatments to cure him, but the experiment backfires, causing Barnabas to age rapidly and assume the appearance of a 200-year-old man. During a seance at Collinwood to contact the spirit of Barnabas' young sister Sarah, Victoria Winters mysteriously disappears and finds that she has traveled back in time to the year 1795.Bonuses: Exclusive interviews with series producer Robert Costello, writer Sam Hall, special make-up artist Dick Smith and actress Lara Parker.Starring:  Joan Bennett, Jonathan Frid, Kathryn Leigh Scott, Louis Edmonds, Nancy Barrett, David Henesy, Clarice Blackburn, Anthony George, Grayson Hall, Joel Crothers, David Ford, Robert Gerringer, Jerry Lacy, Lara Parker, Sharon Smyth, Peter Turgeon, Vince O' Brien, Angus Cairns, Peter Murphy, William Shust, Dorrie Kavanaugh and Alexandra Moltke", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0070B9SK0", "B0070B9RFQ", "B0070B9SAA", "B0070B9S96", "B00007G1WU", "B0070B9RVU", "B0070B9R1U", "B00016MCAE", "B0070B9RNI", "B000060MVO", "B0070B9R06", "B0070B9R9W", "B0070B9RQ0", "B0070B9S46", "B0070B9S0K", "B0070B9RCO", "B0070B9RHO", "B0070B9RUG", "B0070B9R7Y", "B0070B9RF6", "B0070B9S3C", "B0070B9RVA", "B0070B9S28", "B0070B9RRE", "B0070B9SE6", "B0070B9SBY", "B0070B9SAK", "B0070B9SGE", "B000C3H5FI", "B007PZ6SYK", "B0070B9RP6", "B0070B9S1O", "B00001T3H5", "B0070B9RLU", "B001CDLASA", "B008JL8NQ0", "B00177Y9W0", "B0012IWNSQ", "B000YKI4B8", "B000QGDJGK"], "bought_together": ["B0070B9SK0", "B0070B9R1U"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0070B9RMY", "B0070B9R1U", "B0070B9SK0", "B0070B9RFQ"]}, "price": 59.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 102641}, "asin": "B00007G1WQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41X310H3KFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Dark Shadows DVD Collection 4"}
{"description": "While vacationing Down Under, the mystery-solving quintet decides to  head into the Australian outback to take in the sights and a rock festival  competition held at Vampire Rock. But, of course, that is not to be. \"Vampires\"  have been swooping down from the craggy cliffs and abducting the talent, forcing  the detectives to go undercover as a rock band. (Their song? Predictably,   \"Scooby-Doo, Where Are You?\") The aboriginal myth of Yowie Yahoo is thrown in,  along with two aboriginal characters. Adults may have trouble keeping the glam-rock musicians separate from the vampires, but kids will follow enough of the  complex plot and high-tech resolution. This 70-minute movie is a contemporary  take on the vintage television series with Casey Kasem repeating the honors as  the voice of Shaggy. While some of the flower-power looniness of the original is  gone, the basic spirit of classic Scooby-Doo remains intact.

{"description": "What first comes to mind is super-skinny Jimmie Walker proclaiming  \"Dyn-o-mite!\" and waving his arms like a funky scarecrow in a whirlwind of 1970s  jive. But while Walker's James \"J.J.\" Evans Junior became the most famous face  ofGood Times, the bedrock of the sitcom were the actors playing his  parents, Esther Rolle and John Amos as Florida and James Evans, two good-hearted  but fallible people struggling to raise their family amid the poverty of the  Chicago projects. Add to the mix boy-crazy daughter Thelma (Bernnadette Stanis),  preadolescent black activist Michael (Ralph Carter), and Florida's world-wise  best friend Willona (sassy Ja'net DuBois), and you've got one of the best comic  ensembles of the time. Modern politically correct sensibilities may wince a bit  at J.J.'s sometimes cartoonish antics, but what's far more striking about the  first season ofGood Timesis how frank the show was willing to be about  race, politics, class, religion, sexual double standards, and family  conflicts--considerably more direct and daring, in fact, than just about anything you'll  find on television today. The topics of shows range from the corruption of  television evangelism and white-centered history classes in school (Michael gets suspended for stating that George Washington owned slaves) to more typical sitcom themes like a  housekeeping contest or J.J.'s girlfriend troubles--but even the most  lightweight episodes tosses out a few acerbic (and genuinely funny) comments on  the difficulty of being black in America.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00GOC74OI", "B000286S42", "B000068V9Y", "B000068V9X", "B0000ZMH92", "B00007KK5J", "B0006VL1JM", "B0009X7BE6", "B000FSMEBA", "B00008R9MC", "B0009X7BF0", "B0002JZT5U", "B0000B1A5A", "B002E58FT2", "B0002RQ3MU", "B000CELOW2", "B0001AVZDU", "B0000DFZ5O", "B000MGTQ6G", "B0008JIJ1K", "B0002O7Y8U", "B000EQ45BU", "B00I458456", "B002E58FTW", "B002LCOGBE", "B00GOC760U", "B000BYA4I8", "B000E33VZ4", "B000291Q3Y", "B0018W2L1A", "B0007OCG74", "B00008EYBH", "B001DSNEME", "B001J710ZW", "B00005JO2V", "B0001Z3I1C", "B0001O3YHQ", "B0002KE2FW", "B002JH2EK6", "B000Q6GUJS", "B000NJMJHA", "B000291Q3O", "B000VZADPG", "B000CCBCCQ", "B0002W4SX6", "B005XLFB32", "B0009B16TO", "B00D2UMHB0", "B0006N2F04", "B004FHCH4Q", "B0009X7BEQ", "B000AMJG5I", "B0000TPA60", "B00005JLIC", "B0007V6IWQ", "B002JH2EIS", "B000MGBSH6", "B00GLT2SOA", "B000A0GXGK", "B000FSMEB0", "B000G0O5JG", "B0006FYOU6", "B004WO9OOS", "B000OVLBGW", "B002OOK6WM", "B0006N2EZU", "B0072BNKIO", "B0006Z2L4W", "B0002NY8R6", "B002E58FUG", "B004XZ99XC", "B00018D3RI", "B00008EY6N", "B00007AJG2", "B00003L9CG", "B005KR6NQS", "B000077VQ9", "B004TP55Q6", "B001O4KBMS", "B002LCQBM6", "B000087F5D", "B0000TWMQ6", "B002E58FTM", "B00JDCP0QA", "B00A2L1CKO", "B0007KIFK0", "B000YGGNGK", "B001DSNELU", "B0007WFXL2", "B0009A40NO", "B0058J3S16", "B008VIMLRI", "B0009X7BEG", "B004MWLXTO", "B00005UQ9I", "B0009I7NH6", "B007RMQ4HW", "B001D2WUCA", "B001TWT09A"], "bought_together": ["B00GOC74OI", "B000286S42"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00GOC760U", "B001DSNELU", "B00GOC74OI", "B000286S42"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 77236}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 10.5, "brand": "Columbia Tri Star", "asin": "B00007KK5I", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RPF8J8JYL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Good Times - The Complete First Season"}

{"description": "This survey of Italian cinema by Martin Scorsese is a worthwhile follow-up to his 1995 documentaryA Personal Journey Through American Movies. Packed with insight and film clips,Voyagecovers Italian cinema from World War II through the early '60s, the time that the young Scorsese watched these films before starting his career. The heart of the documentary is the Neo-Realism movement--not the lightest of genres, but Scorsese's passion helps considerably. He introduces us to his family and Sicilian ancestors via photos and home movies allowing us to understand how powerfully these films affected him and his family. He talks about how he saw the films, often through inferior prints on television, and calls out details to observe. The filmmaker spends upwards of 15 minutes on a single film, with the bulk of the history centering on five powerhouse directors: Roberto Rossellini (Open City), Vittorio De Sica (The Bicycle Thief), Luchino Visconti (Senso), Federico Fellini (8-1/2), and Michelangelo Antonioni(L'Avventura).Scorsese's four-hour-plus survey should come with a college credit for film history. He examines the major films but also spends time on films that may be hard to find on home video (at least at this time): Rossellini's six-partPaisan, a heart-breaking look at the last days of the war; De Sica's episodicThe Gold of Naples; Fellini's atypicalI Vitelloni, which was a major influence on Scorsese's ownMean Streets; Antonioni'sEclipsewith its radical ending; and Rossellini'sVoyage to Italy, an examination of a marriage that failed worldwide as a film but was a touchstone for the French New Wave movement. The final results are not as accessible asPersonal Journeybut, at worst, a viewer will have working knowledge of more than 20 Italian films (and be able to cheat their way through a discussion). At best, these are four hours that will end too soon and leave you hungry to view these films that have fueled Scorsese's cinematic vision.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305941122", "B00128R94Y", "B008ZDC7M8", "B002945DVG", "B000UJCAKY", "B0004Z312K", "B004M66YUS", "B000059HBY", "B0007M222A", "B006MHZ46A", "B00HRJVHEK", "B00005JKGO", "6305081034", "B002U6DVQ2", "B002JTMNZ0", "B0012KOM6K", "B0009PVZEG", "B004MQ6W5K", "B005KLOPU0", "B00009ME9Z", "B00HE010QM", "B000E3L7L4", "B0001MDQ9E", "B005HK13OK", "B000I0RNV6", "B00197POY0", "B00009PY57", "B000286RNE", "B000IHYXH6", "B007NQSQT6", "0684825007", "B001LMU1C8", "B000FUF7D0", "B0000V6EYU", "B004P0IRHE", "B006TTC5A4", "B00598OA2C", "B00003CXC9", "0375714790", "B00782O7LG", "B00EO2I6XS", "B0039ZBM64", "B00F98FOFY", "B009DA73WG", "B0000687DE", "B002JTMNZA", "B001I2EQUO", "B00DHN8GGW", "B00DZP1C8Q", "1441160698", "B00009Y3PM", "B0007KIFW8", "B00006JMQG", "B00A2XQTIC", "B003VA3JTK", "B0002DB4YQ", "B00GM4OUZE", "B004SIP7US", "B00I3C1T34", "B003VMFWYI", "1594204306", "B00332F3MW", "B004ZG5EYC", "B0040JHNAW", "B007JNWQZS", "B000U95N9Y", "B000JD7YLG", "B00004U12V"], "buy_after_viewing": ["6305941122", "B00128R94Y", "B008ZDC7M8", "630560097X"]}, "price": 17.98, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 157232}, "asin": "B000092T5D", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51EYTJ32umL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "My Voyage to Italy"}

{"description": "An action film rich with politics, espionage, and complicated characters,Traitoris an engrossing film in which the lines between right and wrong are anything but clear and the threats of terrorism and conspiracy across the globe seem startlingly real. Sadim Horn (Don Cheadle) is a devout Muslim, once trained and employed in engineering and explosives by American Special Forces, who has chosen to settle in Afghanistan. FBI agents Clayton (Guy Pearce) and Archer (Neal McDonough) begin investigating an uncooperative Sadim in an Afghanistan prison because of his connections with terrorist Omar (Sa&#1111;d Taghmaoui) and, as events unfold, uncover ties between Sadim and several international bombing incidents. As agents Clayton and Archer follow Sadim around the world, Sadim's dedication to his faith becomes abundantly clear, as does his involvement in an international bombing conspiracy.  What's less than clear in all the contradictory evidence is the nature of Sadim's role in the conspiracy--specifically, which side he's really fighting for.Traitoris an action-packed, suspenseful film with strong acting talent and a disturbingly real message.

Abrams's wonderfully inventiveAlias, as super secret agent Sydney Bristow (Jennifer Garner) came face-to-face with the mother of all super secret agents--herownmother, Irina Derevko (Lena Olin), a former KGB agent presumed dead but alive and more dangerous than ever. After shooting poor Syd, Irina later shows up at the doorstep of the CIA, offering to turn herself in and work for the good guys. But can she be trusted?Aliasset up so much duplicity in its second season that it might have been hard to keep track of who was doing what to whom, but thanks to a great ensemble cast, fast-paced writing and direction, and some cannily cast guest stars,Aliasrode a stunning emotional roller-coaster and never broke its momentum, even when halfway through the season, the show reinvented itself. With episode 13, \"Phase One\" (which aired after the Super Bowl to the show's biggest audience), Syd's original nemesis (and employer) SD-6 changes forever, yet the kick-butt agent still finds herself going up against the malevolent leader Sloane (Ron Rifkin) and his ever-changing set of henchmen. Action fans got plenty of fighting, while romanticAliaswatchers swooned as Syd and the dashing Vaughn (Michael Vartan) finally consummated their unrequited love.The critically acclaimed show owed a debt toBuffy the Vampire Slayerfor its mix of action, romance, mystery, and moral quandaries, but in this seasonAliastruly came into its own--with a climax that came as a total shocker and prepped the show for an emotionally volatile third season. Guest stars included the phenomenal Amy Irving as Sloane's wife, Faye Dunaway as a nefarious bigwig, Christian Slater as a kidnapped scientist, and Ethan Hawke as a fellow CIA agent (or rather, two of them), but it was the dysfunctional nuclear family of Syd, Irina, and father Jack (Victor Garber) that gaveAliasits heart and its strength, whether the three perfectly cast actors (all Emmy nominated) were just bickering or undertaking deadly hand-to-hand combat. And you thought your family had problems!--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001MVWRMK", "B001MVWRNE", "B001MVWRMU", "B001MVWRN4", "B0001I55ZQ", "B004SJU51I", "B00008ZL4Q", "B0047BXR8U", "B000O77SMW", "B00GTZWUPS", "B0047BXR9E", "B000O77SN6", "B003R4ZMQI", "B0079IEPHK", "B00005JNOG", "B000FIMG68", "B00L9FKMC6", "B0006UEVTK", "B00HUPC5X8", "B00KHA9BQ2", "B0047BXR30", "B000092T3Y", "B003UD7JEE", "B00BD6KXKW", "B00079FUI6", "B0051GOB2G", "B000TGURZ8", "B0018CWEYY", "B000P6YNSE", "B00HUCF7AO", "B00H57HOSC", "B00HEQOAIQ", "B000FFJYBQ", "B00E8OMZGG", "B001L5SRJE", "B000NDEXK2", "B0036EH3XE", "B006YG9HJE", "B0077PTWY6", "B001VPJZ0E", "B00133QNS6", "B003R0MEZO", "B003R0MEXQ", "B0019LY5IM", "B00B4804LM", "B000ICLRKC", "B000TM1CL0", "B0024FAR66", "B0077PTWHI", "B002KQ6UE2", "B00A8KJN8M", "B005FISC3Y", "B009LDD4V4", "B00915G6TE", "B000NOKFGW", "B004TJ1GY2", "B002NS2HBM", "B000QDLSR0", "B0009X76ZA", "B0018CWEZI", "B0060MYLCU", "B000FL7CAK", "B00062IDEW", "B002JVWRD6", "B003YF9Q08", "B001B7CNZ6", "B0001907BC", "B00B58948U", "B0013DZNAA", "B00B5ARKC0", "B00IWTVDUW", "B00170LCWC", "B002ZCY7SW", "B004YM6JVO", "B00JF5GAZA", "B009LDD1H6", "B000BZISRQ", "B001FACH7S", "B000NA2BEU", "B000FIMG4U", "B004SJN8XA", "B000ERVJLS", "B001AQMBJQ", "B0058YPJ8G", "B00BGQ2NIO", "B000MR8W92", "B00133QNRW", "B000SMNL92", "B001992NWO", "B004XM38CS", "B000MX7V66", "B0007P0Y7C", "B0012IXBNC", "B0053O8A46", "B00KS9V6EC", "B0006IUE16", "B003L77GZQ", "B000CNE0RO", "B00008YGRU", "B00CD45JBG"], "bought_together": ["B001MVWRNE", "B001MVWRMK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001MVWRNE", "B001MVWRN4", "B001MVWRMU", "B001MVWRMK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 56784}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 21.25, "brand": "Disney", "asin": "B0000ALF8I", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51aeA43SPJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Alias - The Complete Second Season"}

At  first, Jettel refuses to adjust to her new circumstances (she brought  with her a set of china dishes and an evening gown), while Regina adapts  readily to this new world, forming a strong bond with her father's cook,  an African named Owuor. But this is only the beginning of a series of  uprootings, and as the surface of their lives is torn away, Walter and  Jettel find they have little in common, and must--under tumultuous  circumstances--build their marriage anew.

{"description": "Despite its brief theatrical release and dismal box-office returns,City of Ghostsmarked an impressive directorial debut for Matt Dillon. While transplanting a film noir plot to exotic locations that John Huston might've found inviting, Dillon plays to his strengths as an actor, casting himself as a con artist with a guilty conscience, traveling to Cambodia to locate his unscrupulous mentor and partner (James Caan) and extricate himself from a career of bilking innocent victims. The dangerous territory includes a two-faced schemer (Stellan Skarsg&#xE5;rd), a burly French hotelier (Gerard Depardieu), and an alluring architectural restorer (Natascha McElhone) tossed in for obligatory love interest, and Dillon (with cowriter andWild at Heartauthor Barry Gifford) creates an engrossing sense of escalating danger as his character sinks into a quagmire of personal and political corruption.

{"description": "A New Age favorite since itsCD debutin 1990, Enigma'sMCMXC a.D.just gets better on DVD. While the mellow techno chill-out suites of Romanian-born Michael Cretu are not likely to attract any new converts (i.e., those with a low tolerance for \"aural wallpaper\" consisting primarily of noodling synths with a slow-grind pulse rate), devoted fans are sure to appreciate the visual component added here. Featuring gorgeous models and brief peek-a-boo nudity to accompany Enigma's once-controversial combination of sacred music and sexual imagery, these dreamy videos would feel right at home on the Playboy Channel, but they're clean enough (really, they are!) for all-ages viewing. Unfortunately, the ensuing years have seen Enigma's musical stylings copied and co-opted by the upscale porn industry, so all of this comes off as rather tacky and dated, despite the purity and sincerity of Cretu's musical philosophy (which he partially defines in an interesting bonus interview). Still, there's some hypnotic energy here that's undeniable, and \"Sadeness,\" \"Principles of Lust,\" and \"The Rivers of Belief\" still stand out as rich, multilayered masterworks, and the imagery follows a sensual theme just vague enough to allow the liberty of personal interpretation. If you're seeking stress-relief by immersing yourself a soothing envelope of audiovisual comfort, this DVD's got just what the doctor ordered.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000059WU8", "B001IZGPJG", "B000KN9EXQ", "B000002URV", "B000000WC1", "B00005OMTT", "B001DUJNGS", "B000GRUS22", "B000002U6E", "B002S9DRA6", "B0000C7PQK", "B00003XB8K", "B00005OM9O", "B00FXENG8G", "B002RV01QI", "B0025ZITT2", "B000000WFU", "B00I5NKPWC", "B004R1VXU4", "B000B8VX8Y", "B000JK8OYU", "B00AQB2AR4", "B000BTC5LW", "B003ELOQD4", "B008B3MZNI", "B00BBGZ42G", "B001Q8FSWU", "B00005QBZD", "B00EPO13AS", "B0000203YR", "B007XNAQL0", "B00AR1G3FS", "B00HUQC442", "B00004Y6NP", "B003XTUZIC", "B003Y35H44", "B00IS3E30Y", "B00D6QUJ6U", "B00FG1F6T8", "B00E6F155E", "B0002CTSXG", "B00EG0MVMA", "B009F9FQL0", "B00000AC58", "B009D7A04C", "B00004YX39", "B0052WKZZ6", "B00EG0MVR0", "B00EG0MVOI", "B00005U2JA", "B00DW8CYI8", "B000002W42", "B0002VEPI0", "B0090O07RS", "B0074JOCQI", "B00786XVOG", "B000077VOV", "B000002LK1", "B0027OSSYW", "B0000507OS", "B000005S6X", "B00003Q4D9", "B00J89SG0U", "B00000DPAW", "B00065MDRW", "B007NESBK2", "B0040IKHV0", "630463949X", "B004ZN9RWK", "B0000PCUJY", "B000006YHT", "B000005JUB", "B000006YHP", "B000008SHM", "B000092A9I", "B000007R0O", "B0006ZOV7W"], "bought_together": ["B000059WU8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000002URV", "B000059WU8", "B00005OMTT", "B000GRUS22"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 109899}, "categories": [["CDs & Vinyl", "Dance & Electronic"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "New Age"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Pop", "Dance Pop"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Pop", "Vocal Pop"], ["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 17.98, "brand": "EMD", "asin": "B0000CA1HB", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41N3HKV5QVL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Enigma - MCMXC a.

{"description": "Director Robert Duvall (THE APOSTLE) weaves the disparate worlds of murder and dance in this quirky and sometimes impressionistic comedy drama. John (Robert Duvall), an old-school Coney Island-area hit man, is offered a lucrative job in Argentina. He doesn't really want to take it, and his reluctance to leave his beloved stepdaughter Jenny (Katherine Micheaux Miller) and miss her birthday party fuels his obstinacy. But, assured he will be back in time, he takes the job. Once in Buenos Aries, the assassination plot begins to unfold, then sputter, and finally falls apart as the target fails to show up. Needless to say, John misses Jenny's big day, and to get his mind off of things, he catches a traditional Argentinean tango performance. With a reverence for American dance, John is totally blown away by this thrillingly expressive form, and infiltrates the tango circuit through Manuela (Luciana Pedraza), a glowing but modest partner. She and her sister escort John through the history and motion that is tango, while in the meantime the assassination plot picks back up as the target finally returns to Buenos Aries. Much like the dance it depicts, the film navigates between one world of murderous intrigue and conspiracy, and the other of sensual elegance and high-art aesthetics. Duvall also bridges the gulf between these worlds with an inimitable performance", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 351572}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.61, "brand": "", "asin": "B0000DI880", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/418DP7PK5KL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Assassination Tango (Slip) [VHS]"}

{"description": "TheAlien Quadrilogyis a nine-disc boxed set devoted to the fourAlienfilms. Although previously available on DVD as theAlien Legacy, here they have been repackaged with vastly more extras and with upgraded sound and picture. For anyone who hasn't been in hypersleep for the last 25 years, this series needs no introduction, though for the first time each film now comes in both original and \"special edition\" form.Alien(1979) was so perfect it didn't need fixing, and Ridley Scott's 2003 director's cut is fiddling for the sake of fiddling. Watch it once, then return to the majestic, perfectly paced original. Conversely, the special edition of James Cameron'sAliens(1986) is the definitive version, though it's nice to finally have the theatrical cut on DVD for comparison. Most interesting is the alternativeAlien 3(1992). This isn't a \"director's cut\"--David Fincher refused to have any involvement with this release--but a 1991 work-print that runs 29 minutes longer than the theatrical version, and has now been restored, remastered, and finished off with (unfortunately) cheap new CGI. Still, it's truly fascinating, offering a different insight into a flawed masterpiece. The expanded opening is visually breathtaking, the central firestorm is much longer, and a subplot involving Paul McGann's character adds considerable depth to story. The ending is also subtly but significantly different.Alien: Resurrection(1997) always was a mess with a handful of brilliant scenes, and the special edition just makes it eight minutes longer.TheAlien Quadrilogyoffers the first and fourth films with DTS soundtracks, the others having still fine Dolby Digital 5.1 presentation. All four films sound fantastic, with much low-level detail revealed for the first time. Each is anamorphically enhanced at the correct original aspect ratio, and the prints and transfers are superlative. Every film offers a commentary track that lends insight into the creative process--though the Scott-only commentary and isolated music score from the firstAlienDVD release are missing here.Each movie is complemented by a separate disc packed with hours of seriously detailed documentaries (all presented in full-screen with clips letterboxed), thousands of photos, production stills, and storyboards, giving a level of inside information for the dedicated buff only surpassed by theLord of the Ringsextended DVD sets. A ninth DVD compiles miscellaneous material, including an hourlong documentary and even all the extras from the oldAlienlaserdisc. \"Exhaustive\" hardly beings to describe theAlien Quadrilogy, a set that establishes the new DVD benchmark for retrospective releases and looks unlikely to be surpassed for some time.--Gary S.

{"description": "In addition to boasting one of the most astonishing opening sequences in the history of extreme-sports filmmaking,Billabong Odysseyoffers a breathtaking survey of big-wave surfing at a pivotal stage in its evolution. With the advent of Jet-Ski Waverunners used for \"tow-in\" access to gigantic waves that paddle-surfers could never reach, this three-year, globe-trotting quest for the world's biggest waves is nothing less than spectacular. As documentaries go it's a bit cruder than 2003's other surfing movie,Step Into Liquid, and many of the same world-class surfers appear in both films (including 49-year-old Ken Bradshaw, still going strong). ButBillabongis unrivaled in its abundance of jaw-dropping footage--most of it shot from helicopters hovering in close proximity--showing the sheer, terrifying scale of breaking \"tubes\"--some reaching 100 feet--at the most challenging big-wave locations on the planet, including Maverick's at Santa Cruz, California; Cortes Bank off the Pacific Coast; \"Cyclops\" in Australia; Mundaka, Spain; and the treacherous \"Jaws\" reef on the coast of Maui, Hawaii.While touching on various hot topics such as safety training, serious wipe-outs, swell-tracking technology, female surfers (like the great Layne Beachley), and hydrofoil surfboards (billed as \"the future of the sport\"), director Philip Boston applies a casual, competitive structure that's too diffuse and lightweight to have much impact. But when the film focuses on the climactic \"Jaws\" showdown between Carlos Burle and Mike Parsons,Billabong Odysseyachieves a state of raw power and spiritual intensity, culminating in Parsons' best-ever 10-point ride on a massive tube that constantly threatens to consume him. As dozens of adrenaline-junkie surfers strive for new horizons of unprecedented skill,Billabong Odysseychronicles their efforts with amazing bird's-eye cinematography. For surfers and non-surfers alike, this movie must be seen to be believed.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0001FGBUC", "B0006D3HDS", "B004HY3BSI", "B00007L5UY", "B003G7DSF8", "B0000AOV6J", "B0000UX52K", "B001J0FVYU", "B0034F7D4O", "B000VIPXNA", "B004FGA2LM", "B004A95K2K", "B001ECDVKY", "B000GY729C", "B0017LHK3Q", "0767819381", "B004HY3BVK", "B000I834KM", "B001HQZKQA", "B000FCE2IY", "B00AAQHP66", "B004FGA2KI", "B006QS9N1W", "B0009YNSLU", "B0016MJ6FQ", "1620878755", "B002STN6IE", "B00CSW07UQ", "B00006673Q", "B0002F6AQQ", "B004DJBONQ", "B0000648ZP", "1609611020", "007147742X", "B001N26GYI", "B0002VEVUW", "1594869421", "B0000714BX", "B0000507QX", "0811876284", "B0007V6IUS", "B000ALM4AS", "B0017CW5JE", "B00AQTY3XA", "B000LP5FMC", "B003WLNQ50", "B000QCQ7XG", "B003HNA9DA", "B000NO2164", "B000EWFTE6", "B00006673R"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0001FGBUC", "B004HY3BSI", "B0006D3HDS", "B00007L5UY"]}, "price": 3.88, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 47100}, "asin": "B0000WN1PE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516VS777V3L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Billabong Odyssey"}

{"description": "With its shaky five-season tenure (1995-99) including a dozen different time slots and only one major Emmy nomination, the outstandingNewsRadiois the atypical sitcom of its age. While most of the '90s sitcoms were based around a single big name talent (Jerry Seinfeld, Candice Bergen, Drew Carrey),NewsRadiocame from the same stock from earlier showsTaxiandCheers: a relatively unknown cast that rarely ventured away from the place of business. These first 29 episodes (7 as a mid-season replacement the first year), deliver a consistently hilarious show about the day-to-day life with the eccentric staff of New York radio station WNYX. Creator Paul Simms (The Larry Sanders Show) built a talented cast relying on expert delivery and character traits instead of goofy situations. The most famous cast member,Saturday Night Live's Phil Hartman, went against the grain of mostSNLveterans and gleefully took a supporting role, the pompous, silver-tongued anchor Bill McNeal. The lead--the glue--of the series is Kids in the Hall member Dave Foley as the earnest new station manager, Dave Nelson. Soft but eager, Nelson plays lion-tamer delicately maneuvering around staff to keep the station humming along. This is complicated from the get-go when he falls into a secret, but very cute affair with Lisa (Maura Tierney), the ace reporter.The station, like Mary Tyler Moore's TV crew two decades earlier, has a good balance between funny folks and just plain whackos. The former includes Stephen Root as the rich yet time-crunched owner, Joe Rogan as the fix-it man, and Khandi Alexander as Bill's tart co-anchor. The latter is embodied in Andy Dick as the helpless Matthew, a sublime airhead whose comic highjinks are often the show's hardest laughs, and Vicki Lewis, continuing the famous TV tradition of the lovable ditzy secretary that knows all. But the legacy of the show belongs to Hartman who tragically died after the fourth season. His comic bravura is balanced with the ability to play the fool. In one perfect scene, Lisa walks by with only a bra on (don't ask) and Bill doesn't move, reading his newspaper. Lisa returns to slap him anyway, shocking him. \"I didn't say anything.\" Lisa retorts, \"You were thinking it\" and walks away. Hartman eases into a juicy, soft smile and returns to reading, \"Well, that's fair.\"If you're not a fan of commentary tracks, you won't find the love and care that went into this DVD set. There are commentaries on 20 of the 27 episodes with the cast and crew rotating duties. The nice thing about a cast full of comics is that the commentaries are very funny and rewarding for fans. We hear about the casting of the show, Foley's uncanny ability to memorize a script, the art of the archaic reference, and how the fix-it man was--for the half the pilot--Ray Romano. But if you don't have time for the commentaries, watch and laugh hard at the 10-minute (!) gag reel.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000DZ854A", "B000FBH3WW", "B000MGTQ6Q", "B0001Z3I0S", "B0058EE6NK", "B007C8RZXS", "B007C8RZR4", "B0058EE6O4", "B00A2XQU7M", "B000MGBLFK", "B00A2XQTVY", "B001MVYUSO", "B001D2WUDE", "B00EQ2KU7G", "B00GOC74I4", "B0006N2EZK", "B00KNVF3US", "B00005JLIB", "B000A7Q1YC", "B00BM2JVAA", "B001B187BQ", "B003TJM5RK", "B00014K5BO", "B00GHH9HW2", "B000N3T0EQ", "B00GOC74QG", "B000MXPE6U", "B0002NY8R6", "B00005JPI6", "B002OOWL3E", "B0006J27WY", "B0000C9JFQ", "B0006N2EZA", "B00GJNQ4B6", "B000YKYT1M", "B0025KVNOU", "B004J713LA", "B0001907BC", "B00009Y3RW", "B000G6BL88", "B00006ADFR", "B000QFCDAO", "B00HNGC56G", "B002TQKL1Q", "B000092T3Y", "B0018RKEQE", "B00A33J8FM", "B000RGULLA", "B0000E32X2", "B00005JNEQ", "B000FTC1GW", "B000F48D14", "B00188XHF8", "B003QTDH4S", "B00008EY6Q", "B001VPJYZ0", "B000CCBCCQ", "B0058EE6OO", "B000E33VZY", "B001O4KBO6", "B000NA78SE", "B00JHH1VUU", "B00A2XQTF0", "B00008EY6N", "B007KFZ87S", "B00008PHCU", "B00005Q4CT", "B0002W4P98", "B000FBH3WM", "B003XMKUEI", "B004D2GMVM", "B00022FWEU", "B000MX7V66", "B0008KLV96", "B0002JZT5U", "B000291Q3E", "B00IFK7O5G", "B0057IY5CE", "B00IFK7ONI", "B000RW3VDE", "B0057IY5EW", "B000H7JCGE", "B00005JNIS", "B001DSNEM4", "B0002W4SWW", "B00A2L1CJK", "B000EXDRZI", "B00CMDPT68", "B000P5FH5S", "B000NJMJHA", "B000ERVJKE", "B0009X7BEQ", "B0001S6AQE", "B0002KPHVU", "B0025VKX04", "B000OCXNQW", "B000SQFC0O", "B003L77GBU", "B001E6JC1M"], "bought_together": ["B000DZ854A", "B000FBH3WW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001DSNEM4", "B000FBH3WW", "B000DZ854A", "B00BM2JVAA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 54053}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 11.59, "brand": "Columbia Tri Star", "asin": "B0000ZMH8S", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RS4V1W7TL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "NewsRadio - The Complete First &amp; Second Seasons"}
{"description": "It sounds likeLove Story, but with an intriguing twist. 23-year-old wife and mom Sarah Polley has spent her entire life sacrificing for others and living on the economic fringe; when she discovers she has only a few months to live, she resolves to keep the news secret. In her remaining time, she plots a course for various unfinished plans and deferred dreams:  write a journal, leave future messages for her kids, make a stranger (Mark Ruffalo) fall in love with her. Obviously, the danger of sentimentality lurks in director Isabel Coixet's concept, and the film does have a few soggy moments. Some critics lost patience with the main character's seeming selfishness (a good post-movie conversation starter). Yet there is something powerful in her insistence on claiming a small piece of existence exclusively for herself. Polley (Guinevere) gives a typically honest performance, with fine support by Scott Speedman and Deborah Harry.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000NJWIPI", "B000066JBR", "B000T5O48A", "B00005MKKV", "B008NA3I30", "B001QERPAC", "B0000844LU", "B00FXWAZW8", "B0002IQE2I", "0780622251", "B004QL7KKC", "B00AEFXESQ", "0767835093", "B00005T30L", "B004A8ZWV0", "B00000F7E6", "B00AKGG6JS", "B002K2KMJA", "B00DEKKEPO", "B0051GLDVS", "B00H9HZITU", "B0036TGSJE", "B00E8G5GU6", "B00003CWTI", "B00BLN4UDS", "B009AJB0YM", "B002AS463W", "B00005YUPC", "0767802519", "B001OQCV1K", "B006KH6CF4", "B0014D5RBE", "B004SIP6GI", "B00FRILRYS", "0800141806", "B003NKU9AK"], "bought_together": ["B000NJWIPI", "B000066JBR"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00A81MV3U", "B000NJWIPI", "B0000ZMGWK", "B00009MEJ6"]}, "price": 9.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 89272}, "asin": "B00013WWSY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51WK3YG5EFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "My Life Without Me"}
{"description": "Based on the bestseller by John Grisham,Runaway Juryis a slick thriller that's exciting enough to overcome the gaps in its plot. The ultimate target has been changed: Grisham's legal assault on the tobacco industry was switched to the hot-button issue of gun control (no doubt to avoid comparison toThe Insider) in a riveting expos&#xE9; of jury-tampering. Gene Hackman plays the ultra-cynical, utterly unscrupulous pawn of the gun-makers, using an expert staff and advanced electronics to hand-pick a New Orleans jury that will return a favorable verdict; Dustin Hoffman (making his first screen appearance with real-life former roommate Hackman) defends the grieving widow of a gun-shooting victim with idealistic zeal, while maverick juror John Cusack and accomplice Rachel Weisz play both ends against the middle in a personal quest to hold gun-makers accountable. It's riveting stuff, even when it's obvious that Grisham and director Gary Fleder have glossed over any details that would unravel the plot's intricate design.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783226942", "B000P5FH3K", "B002NZK5R8", "B00AEFXYJA", "B002NZK5UU", "0767810872", "B002NZK5VO", "B0000694XY", "630542828X", "B00AEFXT1S", "B0006HBZBA", "B0045HCJ8K", "B0000C3I8M", "B004EPYZP8", "B0010YSD7W", "B00096S49Y", "B000063US3", "B000R4SMCW", "1558908382", "B001NY4WYC", "B003ASLJIQ", "6305428115", "B00005B6JZ", "B00005JL8F", "B00005UQ9T", "B00008EY9G", "B00008K77D", "0800141806", "B00005JPT0", "B00003CXFV", "B000P0I4O4", "B000CEV3M8", "B00441GYPG", "0790732149", "B000SFOW8I", "B000TJ6PBK", "0783240295", "B001I2EQUY", "B000055Y0Y", "B000NTMA0Q", "B002O3Z4ZW", "B002AT8KAG", "0790730979", "B00003CY5G", "B0038Z5T4Q", "B004SIP9RO", "B004YCKKFK", "B002AS464Q", "B00AMSM9DG", "0783226888", "B00AADAK5W", "B0031OCY2E", "B002DU39GW", "B00000K3TU", "B002LMV7R0", "B0013D8LBS", "B000GFLKF8", "B000CEXEWA", "B00008L3S6", "B00005ATZT", "B00AEBB9UK", "6304806434", "B002AT8K9W", "B00AEFXEGS", "B003ASLJQ8", "B0043X1FNQ", "B000BNX3B4", "B001CC7PLM", "B002QW7AMG", "B000JYW5BE", "B000Y11B8U", "B001HVZOB6", "B00BLN4UKQ", "B005NKIPUY", "B00015YVDG", "B00H91LWDC", "0792844874", "6305657947", "B003L20IG0", "0780618548", "B00DWZHTOU", "B003Q6D2B4", "B000ENC5YW", "B00GUO2SKA", "B0010YVCB6", "B00009WVSL", "B000G5SILC", "B000F8DV1M", "B00FQRZ6EM", "B000OYAT3U", "B00AEFXIIW", "B008JFURII", "B00005JNQA", "B002O3Z4XY", "B000059XTK", "B00005JN5E", "B001ECDVK4", "B000K7VHQ4", "B00000JGHL"], "bought_together": ["B000P5FH3K", "0783226942"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001I2EQUY", "B000P5FH3K", "B00AEFXYJA", "B002NZK5VO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 38867}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.67, "brand": "Twentieth Century Fox", "asin": "B00014NEZI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51X52Z0CBSL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Runaway Jury (Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "While it doesn't hold together as a three-hour TV drama,Dreamkeepershould prove enthralling to anyone interested in Native American myths and legends. A variety of tribal folklore provides the episodic thrust of this typical Hallmark production, which relies too heavily on digital effects--and the plodding direction of Hallmark regular Steve Barron--in telling the story of a resentful Lakota teenager (Eddie Spears) who reluctantly agrees to drive his wise old grandfather (August Schellenberg) from their South Dakota \"rez\" to an All-Nations Powwow in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Along the way, the tradition-bound elder serves as tribal \"dreamkeeper\" for his initially resistant grandson, who gradually realizes that his grandfather's stories--visualized through effects-laden reenactments involving all manner of magic and mystery--are essential in preserving the fading cultures of the Lakota and the several other tribes whose folklore depends on unbroken generations of oral tradition. While some of the lavishly dramatized tales can stand alone as authentic Native American myth-making,Dreamkeeperlacks the overall structure that could've given the stories a cumulative magical impact. Still, it's an admirable attempt to introduce neglected cultures into the television mainstream.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000087F0X", "B0000D0YWJ", "B000UL61KW", "6305428417", "B0046ZYEU2", "B0001FVDI2", "B00005OSJN", "0767812182", "B004UOHNIY", "B0008FXSSS", "B003Y7F1OG", "B001N5BDX4", "B00013F34Y", "B001PSUM9K", "B00CLH09JM", "B0007UDC80", "B000A2WA9C", "B0000JCFN6", "B00337DRGQ", "B0025Z4Q3U", "B000AXWHP8", "B00015YVPO", "B00CS7GYF8", "B000AQ6A9E", "B002IFSA8O", "B00003L9BB", "B001UW59JO", "B007PXYWNQ", "B0001I55YW", "B00CDWQNMW", "B002DHACT2", "B00006RG78", "B005I0DV2G", "B000V2IOXC", "B005HIBWPM", "B0002S65WC", "B003XMKU48", "B000I5YCCY", "B00005JLD4", "B0041518AQ", "B009B6XJVQ", "B001AR0D54", "B0009ETCYW", "B000UVV274", "B005J7K9BO", "B005I0DV4Y", "6305504024", "B00003CXB5", "B000FBFZ18", "B00006FD9Z", "B0007R8E54", "B000AGTPVY", "1573623903", "B004AOECXI", "B008YAPPXK", "B0083JEE1G", "6302555450", "B009INAI02", "B000059H7K", "B000ELJ3E4", "0312147619", "B00FWSWORC", "B001BNFRB2", "B00008CMR5", "B0000A02Y4", "6305428360", "B000LV6OBM", "0767817672", "B000ION22Q", "B00005221M", "B0089VX0ZE", "B0041SI7DE", "039331362X", "B003TNS3CW", "B0025X4PFG", "B004HHX9T6", "0914610007", "B0007OY2OO", "B00002E220", "B007ZXW3LY", "0061808407", "B003L8K5VC", "1602377340", "B00196NHAO", "B000274TJ4", "B00267OBBE", "B003TNS3IQ", "B00BD8GQ2Y", "B000SK5ZDY", "0061967831", "B00005U156", "B000CSUNBQ", "080613691X", "0140144560", "B00005QFER", "6301928326", "0826304362", "B00000F5KH", "B000007Q6L"], "bought_together": ["6305428417", "B000087F0X"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00CS7GYF8", "B000087F0X", "0767812182", "B000UL61KW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 24234}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 29.95, "brand": "LION&#39;S GATE ENTERTAINMENT", "asin": "B00019330O", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41NOfRgD3oL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Dreamkeeper"}
{"description": "Lots happened behind the scenes between seasons and early on in the seventh year ofFriends, leaving audiences speculating this might be the last. Matthew Perry became seriously ill again, and returned looking more emaciated than ever. Courtney Cox regained weight, but despite finishingScream 3happily, things were already rocky with David Arquette. Much was made in the press about Aniston marrying Brad Pitt, of course, but the real news (allaying fans' fears) was NBC's expensive renewal of the cast for two years at $750,000 per episode each (more than six times their previous increase). On-screen, at least there was Chandler and Monica's engagement lasting the whole year, despite predictable ups and downs (e.g., \"The One with the Truth About London\" revealing that Monica fancied Joey). By the time we finally get to \"The One with Chandler's Dad\" (Kathleen Turner!), it seems inevitable that the two-part finale will be an insane mess--but with a happy-ish ending. Sure enough, \"The One with Monica and Chandler's Wedding\" features Gary Oldman joining in the chaos as Chandler repeatedly goes missing.Other star turns in the year wereSeinfeld's Jason Alexander as a suicidal office manager, Susan Sarandon as soap queen bitch Jessica Lockhart, Denise Richards as one of Ross and Monica's endless number of cousins, and Winona Ryder as a surprise old friend, prompting \"The One with Rachel's Big Kiss.\" But perhaps the most telling installment of this weirdly atmospheric year was \"The One Where They All Turn Thirty.\" It suggested that maybe the Friends were all getting too old to carry on living their frivolous lives the same way after all.--Paul Tonks", "related": {"also_bought": ["B003TNW030", "B003TNW03K", "B0006ZM8M2", "B0000C2IXN", "B003TNW03A", "B003TNW04Y", "B0000844MI", "B000068CNX", "B003TNW02G", "B005IA9JRM", "B005MG8UNG", "B005IA9JSG", "B005IA9JQ8", "B00020HAWY", "B005IA9JVI", "B00B1LKXPY", "B000HT3P7E", "B0009WFEEG", "B008LCRABQ", "B008LCRA98", "B000TM1CKQ", "B0002I84FS", "B005SJGIV8", "B008L0YMZA", "B008LCRAC0", "B000T22PVG", "B000GRUMQY", "B0001907BW", "B000A7PKGW", "B002BJGYU8", "B001TKJDNA", "B000G1R3A8", "B000RGULLA", "B004GJYRFA", "B0058JEHTS", "B0010X5X4O", "B000W91RUG", "B001PQZYQI", "B000HT3P6U", "B0024FAR6Q", "B000J4QW7W", "B002N5N4FS", "B000NOKFH6", "B002BJGYV2", "B0007R4SWC", "B0044LYRFA", "B008LCRAFC", "B003CN5SAY", "B00GUOJJUW", "B0019CSXAM", "B00005JM3A", "B000EHSVN2", "B000OHZKZ4", "B002BJGYTY", "B00029RTCG", "B001RXDM2C", "B000ERVK5S", "B003L77G6A", "B00005JOHC", "B0001CCXZW", "B008FTWT7K", "B000NA78SE", "B004GJYRA0", "B0090SI53C", "B000J3OTSM", "B001992NWO", "B000HT3P60", "B004EPZ0BG", "B00005AVCA", "B00G3XHH68", "B003TFAJ18", "B000EHSVMS", "B00BEIYMZ6", "B000NA2BEU", "0767827686", "B002N5N5NE", "B000EHSVLE", "B005Z9MFRC", "B008X6N8KW", "B00009Y3RW", "B009LDD1X0"], "bought_together": ["B003TNW030", "B003TNW03K"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005IA9JQI", "B003TNW030", "B003TNW04Y", "B005IA9JRM"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 12450}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 15.98, "brand": "Warner Brothers", "asin": "B0001AW066", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51SyXqeC-bL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Friends: Season 7"}
{"description": "Providing a unique opportunity for the appreciation of Yasujiro Ozu's signature style, Criterion's definitive double-feature ofA Story of Floating Weeds(1934) andFloating Weeds(1959) demonstrates the evolution of a master. Drawing inspiration from the now-obscure 1928 American carnival-troupe dramaThe Barker, Ozu first madeA Story of Floating Weedsas a silent film (despite the advent of sound by that time), and Criterion's DVD features a sublime, newly recorded original score that sounds and feels like it's been part of the film all along. The film itself concerns a traveling Kabuki troupe faced with dramatic revelations as they perform in a rural village: Their master has had a son from a former lover whom he is visiting for the first time in a dozen years. Unaware of his parentage, the now-grown son thinks the visitor is his rarely seen uncle, and the master's mistress, upon discovering her lover's secret family, plots to undermine their relationship by urging a young actress to seduce the son, knowing that this would enrage the master's discreet familial pride. By story's end, all of these central relationships will undergo deep and resonant change.Ozu was justifiably proud of this meticulous character study, in which his celebrated low-angle style began to assert itself. A quarter-century later, he remade the film asFloating Weeds, retaining the same story and characters, switching the setting to a seaside town, and demonstrating a more casual acceptance of human foibles that makes the 1959 version (Ozu's first film in color) relatively calm and compassionate when contrasted with the more turbulent tone of the '34 silent. Having grown as an artist, Ozu was at his stylistic peak here, having refined his style to the point where all camera movement had given way to flawless refinement of static compositions. These and other comparisons abound in the study of original and remake; to that end, commentaries by preeminent Japanese film expert and dialogue translator Donald Richie (on the '34 film) and film critic Roger Ebert (onFloating Weeds) provide astutely thorough appreciations of the parallel structures, stylistic evolution, and cultural specifics of films that, until the early 1970's, were considered \"too Japanese\" for an international audience. Never dry or pretentious, their scholarly analyses lend solid, sensitive context to the enjoyment of two of Ozu's most critically and commercially successful films.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000OPPAF6", "B001BEK8CE", "B003ICZW7S", "B00026L7MC", "B00005JLV7", "B000EOTWIS", "B0012Z3630", "B00EO2I6W4", "B000BB14I0", "0780023307", "B00094AS6I", "B006X96PBU", "0520032772", "B00A8QDHYW", "B00004W3HF", "B000AQKUD6", "B000BB14IA", "6305257450", "B00CEIOH8C", "B00092ZLEY", "B000NOK0H6", "B001CW7ZTE", "B00IGK6T9W", "B000KRNGNQ", "B005D0RDPM", "B0019X400S", "B00B2BYXWM", "7885729117", "B0026VBOJM", "B000067IY6", "B00019JR5Y", "B000AQKUG8", "B00005BHW6", "B00J2PQYG8", "B00J2PQZRQ", "B00005B1ZL", "B00005JLMU", "B001C0I608", "B00003CXUM", "B00HE01030", "B00AQ6J3AG", "B0001UZZSG", "B00F98FNNM", "B001LMU19G", "B00B2BYXSQ", "B0000A02TW", "B00A8QDI3M", "B0009WIE2A", "B000305ZYS", "6305081034", "B00JC9SWSC", "B00IGK6TGU", "B00GA9F2PI", "B004NWPY20", "B000C8Q900", "B00CEIOHPU", "B00GBT62N8", "B000PKG6O4", "B005152C7S", "B00HVOFP08", "B00HRISNPM", "B0000BWVCR", "0780022343", "B001LMU1C8", "B00005M2C7", "B001BEK8E2", "B00F98FOFY", "B00004XQN5", "B00BJB2G74", "B00180R072", "B005D0RDCU", "B00HVOFP12", "B00DZP1C3Q", "B0007989Y8", "B00004Z1FM", "B00AQ6J5CC", "B007N5YJZM", "B0018Z2IJ2", "B00CUKTGQM", "B002U6DVQ2", "B000M2E3FY", "B00GPPXNEE", "B00687XNQM", "B00HE011DE", "B00129CFMY", "B00GPPXOTS", "B0007989YS", "B00005A8TV", "B00CUKTHD4", "B00005UQ7T", "B00DZP1BUU", "B00JPUURI6", "B004WPYO3I", "B000PKG6OE", "B004ALIG4M", "B000244EYW", "B00180R06I", "B004OOL73W", "B009RWRIMA"], "bought_together": ["B001BEK8CE", "B000OPPAF6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000OPPAF6", "B00EO2I6W4", "B00005JLV7", "B000EOTWIS"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 140253}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 26.49, "brand": "IMAGE ENT.", "asin": "B0001GH5RY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51XvpGDW3tL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Stories of Floating Weeds (A Story of Floating Weeds / Floating Weeds) (The Criterion Collection)"}

Henry (Sandler) lives an enviable life in a Hawaiian paradise, spending every night with a beautiful tourist in search of an island fling.  It's a sweet life with no strings attached...until he meets Lucy (Barrymore).  He and Lucy hit it off from the get-go, but the next day she acts like she doesn't know him.  Has his karma come around to kick him in the butt or what?  Actually, Lucy has short-term memory loss so every night all memory of her day is erased.  But a man in love will go to any lengths to win over the girl of his dreams, and if that means having to find imaginative ways of doing it over again every day, then Henry's up for the challenge.

The doctor is specifically interested in collecting blood samples for an HIV study, but the more prisoners open up to him, the more compassionate and committed he becomes about their survival. Babenco's episodic structure givesCarandirua dimension of memory and constant shots of energy, so that even the most horrifying events--drug-related murder, rape, revenge--can't drive this tale into abject misery. Based on actual events, the drama's climactic police raid on the prison (a reconstruction of a 1992 riot called the Carandiru Massacre) is a tour de force.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001CDFY2I", "B00000F5KH", "B004SIP6GI", "B00022FW4U", "B005TZFYUM", "B004EBT81I", "B00075YVTE", "B00375LBM6", "B002W2U8V0", "B000J3OTOG", "B0000640VQ", "B005TZFZLA", "B004SIP6I6", "B00195FU82", "B005Q4CKLC", "B00005N8A9", "B003N2CVOU", "B000GNOGW4", "B00IA7MFEO", "B004V2S4Z6", "B0006354CA", "B00DRCY8SI", "B0009X75EM", "B000FIHNHU", "B0007OY2VC", "B00ANRG3YW", "B000A59PNS", "B002BWP3UC", "B002FHGESI", "B00004Y7CZ", "6305069131", "B001KWHO8I", "B001EOSDRI", "B00005QJIX", "B000056C0E", "B001L2S1WU", "B00005N5RO", "B000CNESU8", "B00E849QSG", "B00GHP8SH4", "B0006TPDVG", "B000GNOGWE", "B00008978J", "1569758239", "B004L03B3S", "B004V2S4P6", "B0036TGSJE", "0802170102", "1585103462", "193482402X", "B00DUJH8V2", "B001AMH7XA", "B002BWP3UM", "B000FC2FX8", "B000NHG7D4", "B00682LSKU", "B00AWQEK26", "B0002J4X20", "B006H3KQZ8", "B000L6S92E", "B0041KKYF6", "B0034G4P58", "B004BV5O6O", "B000EULK14", "1585103446", "B002VECLVO", "B0012OSGV8", "B001F114IA", "B001AZKB8K", "B00432M43C", "B008S2NABI", "B000UNYJV8", "B005LYLP8Q", "B005JJCMN0", "B00005JMIJ", "B005HFI7IU", "B000067IZ3", "B004MWLXVC", "B00HF98SY4", "B00005JNCZ", "B005CXSIJK", "B0007QJ1V6", "B00023B1LC", "B000P0J06U", "B00005QW5X", "B00008R9L1", "B004ISWRGK", "B003W1QFPI", "B000059H7D", "B0006Z2NKE", "B000J10F8W"], "bought_together": ["B001CDFY2I", "B004SIP6GI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004SIP6GI", "B004EBT81I", "B000J3OTOG", "B00000F5KH"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 137205}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 10.09, "brand": "Columbia Tristar Home Entertainment", "asin": "B0002LJTIG", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51FKHFC0T7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Carandiru"}

{"description": "Long before Ashton met Demi or Topher got lost inTraffic, the makers ofThird Rock from the Sunstepped into the Wayback Machine and emerged withThat '70s Show. It would go on to become the Fox Network's most successful sitcom sinceMarried... with Children. Set in the Wisconsin suburbs of 1976, the action centers around 17-year-old Eric Forman (Topher Grace), his friends, and his family. He's an ordinary teenager, much like the slackers of Richard Linklater'sDazed and Confused, with an interest in girls, cars, beer, and rock & roll (but not necessarily in that order).Eric's friends include hipster Hyde (Danny Masterson), exchange student Fez (Wilmer Valderrama), and dim-bulb Kelso (Ashton Kutcher). Donna (Lora Prepon), Eric's neighbor, is also a friend, but she'll soon become something more, while Kelso already has a girlfriend, the bossy Jackie (Mila Kunis)--and a crush on Eric's sister Laurie (Lisa Robin Kelly). Kelso and Jackie will spend a good part of the first year breaking up just to make up, while Hyde pines for Donna and Fez for Jackie. Eric's family also includes father Red (Kurtwood Smith) and mother Kitty (Debra Jo Rupp). Donna's includes mother Midge (former Bond girl Tanya Roberts) and perm-sporting father Bob (Don Stark).The first season boasts a period-perfect bevy of guest stars, including Danny Bonaduce (\"Eric's Burger Job\"), Eve Plumb (\"The Keg\"), and Marion Ross as Eric&#x92;s grandmother (\"Sunday, Bloody Sunday\" and other episodes). That said, ifThat '70s Showwere just a nostalgia trip, it wouldn't have lasted for over seven seasons. Alas, lightning wouldn&#x92;t strike twice. When the same producers followed-up withThat '80s Showa few years later, it would soon disappear without a trace. Accept no substitutes:That '70s Showis the real deal--a retro-comedy, likeHappy Days, with heart.--Kathleen C.

{"description": "When a movie can blend passionate social concern with good old-fashioned suspense, it must be doing something right.Maria Full of Gracescores high on both counts. Maria is a Colombian teenager who, for a large paycheck, agrees to be a mule for drug-runners:  she has to swallow dozens of thumb-sized capsules of heroin and smuggle them into New York. This debilitating process is painstakingly described, and of course not everything goes as planned when Maria and her fellow mules land in America. Director Joshua Marston is working on a low budget, which explains the film's narrow, single-minded focus--but this may be a strength, not a weakness. The trump card is the lead performance of Catalina Sandrino Moreno, who won awards at the Seattle and Newport Film Festivals. Her empathetic face carries us along on Maria's journey, and humanizes a problem that is too easily relegated to a headline.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002FHGESI", "B00005JNCZ", "B0041KKYF6", "B000N3T0DW", "B00080Z53O", "B000O76ZQC", "B00005N8A9", "B00180IPM6", "B00008AOX5", "B0036TGSJE", "B008S2NABI", "B000YIGNCC", "B0007NBJHI", "B0042EJDGM", "B000RHRGSK", "B00AZMFKXK", "B005HFI7IU", "B000LV6OC6", "B00005JL57", "B0015ET3YO", "B003A0T8BO", "B004XVMCMG", "B000WC38IC", "B002M2T1VI", "B000N3SU6K", "B001ILTUKQ", "B0052LE7C4", "B005FIXA6S", "B002E01LOI", "B00GJNQ3S0", "B0047685T6", "B00075VX2C", "B00005JLQW", "B000AM4P90", "B001UV4XC4", "B004SIP7S0", "B00006G8G3", "B004SIP6GI", "B00005LZOD", "B0011FLH14", "B004MNM1FI", "B002M2T1V8", "B0086900LG", "B002BWP3UC", "B00E5G03KM", "B000AYEIDQ", "B00134PSV8", "B001FOPOD8", "B0000AMU29", "B00003CXRG", "B0014BQR6U", "B000274TLW", "B000LXHFMW", "B0000C9JFO", "B0001CNQX0", "B00004U1FA", "B00E1S1MMM", "B007961SAE", "B000GETTJI", "B004IF4EVY", "B00F6Y3E26", "B0032AJVE6", "B003O3EKRO", "B003X3BYJM", "B0009HLC9W", "B0000714BS", "B00000F5KH", "B002VECLXC", "B0000714BQ", "B0009S4IGK", "B002FUI4CE", "B00006BS7S", "B00APUAKYG", "B000K2V7F0", "B000SLYE6M", "0764146076", "B0000A2ZTY", "B0002VEZ3U", "1444137697", "B001M5BF7Y", "B000KJU15U", "B001Q56XOA", "B001QX014A", "0070020698", "B001S400C0", "B000VXUW0E", "B00H1RMPH6", "B000QYKDFC", "B000067IZ3", "B000JBXH78", "B00IQIAL8Y", "B007L6VPXC", "B0051T46YG", "B0002DRDIW", "B002EZLPOO", "B000N3T0DM", "B0002RQ316", "B0000U0X20", "B0013HL6ES"], "bought_together": ["B000O76ZQC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00180IPM6", "B0036TGSJE", "B005HFI7IU", "B000O76ZQC"]}, "price": 4.09, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 3577}, "asin": "B0002TT0MI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51o4PdGtr3L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Maria Full of Grace"}
{"description": "Midway throughFrasier's redemptive final season (which earned Emmys for Kelsey Grammer and David Hyde Pierce), Martin Crane (John Mahoney) reassures his son, \"Just when you think that you're in a rut and nothing exciting will ever happen again, pow, that's when it does.\" The same could have been said ofFrasier's redemptive final season. Not that the multi-Emmy-honored series had ever really jumped the couch, but by its 11th season, it had lost some of its sparkle. And then, POW! VeteranFrasierwriters Christopher Lloyd and Joe Keenan return to the fold. POW! Wendie Malick joins the seamless ensemble as brash lounge singer Ronee Lawrence, who becomes a love interest for Martin. POW! Daphne (Jane Leeves), underutilized since her marriage to Niles, becomes pregnant. POW! Frasier opens his own private practice. POW! Laura Linney guest stars as Charlotte, who becomes the hapless Frasier's own Miss Right. The series also benefited greatly from a stellar roster of character actors, who rose to the occasion of this gold standard series' final year. Penny Johnson (24), Sarah Silverman (School of Rock), and Dan \"Homer Simpson\" Castellaneta christen Frasier's couch in the episode, \"The Return of Maris.\" Jennifer Tilly is at her ditzy, delectable best as a pick-up in \"Miss Right Now.\" Laurie Metcalf replaces Emma Thompson as Frasier's first wife, children's entertainer Nanny G, in \"Caught in the Act.\" Always welcome are Bebe Neuwirth as Lilith (\"Guns 'N Neuroses\") and Harriet Sansom Harris as Frasier's unscrupulous agent Bebe (the series finale, \"Goodnight, Seattle\").ButFrasierwas never about stunt casting. It's the writing, stupid, which, actually, was anything but. Episodes such as \"Boo,\" \"The Doctor Is Out,\" \"Coots and Ladders,\" and \"Caught in the Act\" recaptureFrasier's unique blend of wit and farce.

{"description": "Billed as \"the day music changed history,\" the Live Aid concerts of July 13, 1985, were held to raise money to fight the horrifying famines sweeping Africa. The brainchild of Bob Geldof and representing the efforts of countless musicians and technicians, Live Aid was a genuine and inspiring effort to help the victims of an overwhelming calamity. Twenty years after the twin concerts (one in London, one in Philadelphia) were broadcast worldwide, the 4-DVD treatment furthers the cause, with proceeds going toward the Band Aid Trust.The DVD set opens with a heartbreaking documentary on the crisis, followed by videos of the two hit songs that represented the collaborative nature of Geldof's efforts&#x97;Band Aid' s \"Do They Know It's Christmas?\" and USA for Africa's \"We Are the World.\" Since Live Aid was never intended to be released in a recorded format, preservation of TV footage has been unreliable, resulting in some glaring omissions. Led Zeppelin's semi-reunion doesn't appear, and neither does a legendary session with Bob Dylan, Ron Wood, and Keith Richards. Some sets by performers who were popular at the time may inspire either nostalgic glee or head-scratching (Kiki Dee fans, you know who you are). Sprinkled amid these performances are a couple real gems, including a performance by Run DMC, the event's sole representative of the ascendant rap movement. Much of the music here was a passing fad, but the sentiment that brought it all together is timeless.-- Ryan Boudinot", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000BHHVPO", "B00005V1WV", "B003VRV9FY", "B002HWUU3G", "B0006IUDB2", "B000VZBCWE", "0881010243", "B00AU15GLC", "B00009P1O2", "B00884S0TI", "B00J0LH0XK", "B000W00Y0Y", "B009DH372Y", "B00009VTYE", "B00DPH7QEI", "B003ZVU1P0", "B00DPH7V8E", "B0009VBTPA", "B00FGWTNL4", "B003ELOQD4", "B00FCAK1HU", "B001NXDSLQ", "B000EHSVP0", "B009DT98RK", "B002CSC5EC", "B00IT3KPXM", "B000077VPU", "B0012YYZYK", "B0002CTSXG", "B00K6D1HSK", "B003C1SPX8", "B00KF1CWF0", "B0001ENXYA", "B00006LPCX", "B00005T31Q", "B00HQI823Q", "B006GH6IWU", "B00006LPAH", "B001R0KH3M", "B00008PX8P", "B000228EQS", "B000HEZC7K", "B003UPPO2G", "B0000DG7C0", "B00013F35I", "B0001JXOOO", "1573306932", "B00006JU7P", "B0000DJZB4", "B00197YZ8G", "B00005NFZQ", "125000568X", "B002QH2NUA", "B00004YZFR", "B000654YR4", "B00428CPUY", "B000H5U5VM", "B002WJHBEU", "B000JMKI9M", "B005OGYH9A", "B000BTC5LW", "630463949X", "B005V4X8TK", "B0017WI5JI", "B00092ZMDY", "B000F8O49A", "B0053TWVAK", "B0001US8BC", "B008N5UX74", "B0007Y89ZM", "B000BOH90Y", "B00FLDG52I", "B00HQI7VMY", "B00003CXB1", "B000VSGHYO", "B0054QD5CK", "B000OYC7A8", "B0000CEB4V", "B00CG0YLGG", "B00018D2X8", "0760340102", "B002N7W3PS", "B0000DBJDM", "B000621484", "6305165971", "B003E1QBPA", "B0030BOCE6", "B0006I0S6C", "6304498977", "B000T81SSG", "B000VSDNE6", "B001F9FHF8", "B0000AVHDC", "B004NJC0B6", "B001NP8PQW", "B00064AEOC", "B004USUOUO", "B002SQFZ68", "6305870810", "B005Y423ZC"], "bought_together": ["B000BHHVPO", "B00005V1WV"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000BHHVPO", "B000VZBCWE", "B003VRV9FY", "B00AU15GLC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 22389}, "categories": [["CDs & Vinyl", "Alternative Rock", "British Alternative", "Britpop"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Classic Rock", "Arena Rock"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Rock"], ["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 32.95, "brand": "Alfred Music", "asin": "B0002Z9HT8", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41U4gLwOWQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Live Aid  (4 Disc Set)"}
{"description": "The vintage concert footage alone makesFestival Expressa memorable and worthwhile endeavor, offering scintillating performances byJanis Joplin, theBand(their rollicking version of \"Slippin' and Slidin'\" is particularly mind-blowing), theGrateful Dead,Buddy Guy, and others (remember Mashmakhan?). In 1970, during the heyday of the rock festival, promoter Ken Walker decided to organize a traveling musical revue, bringing the mountain to Mohammed, as it were. In five days' time, the festival played in three Canadian cities with the entire conglomeration traveling, playing, and getting smashed together the whole way. Nearly as rewarding as the live performances are the candid scenes of the train ride itself, an endless jam session and party during which musicians of all shapes and sizes let their hair down--musically and otherwise. The contemporary interviews with Walker and some of the surviving musicians aren't particularly noteworthy, except as a way to prove that it all actually happened. Walker comes off as a hero in the film: he treated the musicians like royalty and insisted that the train roll on even though he was losing his shirt. (His financial failure is a large reason why this material stayed in the vaults for so long.) Perhaps the most remarkable scene is an off-the-cuff, LSD-fueled train jam featuring Joplin, the Band's Rick Danko, and the Dead'sJerry Garciaplaying the old chestnut \"Ain't No More Cane.\" Danko is so obliterated that even Janis has to ask him if he's OK--when Janis is worried aboutyourstate of mind, you must be pretty messed up.--Marc Greilsamer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0009PBLZE", "B00003CXB1", "B003NOGNX8", "B001FWRZ14", "1573306932", "B00006JU7P", "B005HI4LLO", "B0084NZEWO", "B001NXDSLQ", "B001L7S0F8", "B008PALH1I", "B00IPL286U", "B00HQI823Q", "B0007GADYU", "B00004YZFR", "B0029LD2QW", "B0002WZTJI", "B00ARX2W9C", "B004T5IVXK", "B000E5LEWE", "B001CRRADU", "B00F1W1SKI", "B0034KVTLC", "B00FLDG52I", "B008B1SJOE", "B0085KGHI6", "B0015E6WX4", "B0002GTX8C", "B000EZ7ZZ4", "B0009E3234", "B008NR92SI", "B0018M6J7C", "B002CSC5EC", "B001TLWR46", "B00772M2Y6", "074327749X", "B00B08FLVO", "B00H3JHH6Q", "B002E01M9C", "B0090O07S2", "B000EHSVO6", "B00E34A9FU", "B008HFS4XU", "B00E5MIMHW", "B000W1V5TM", "B000B8IANU", "B00KPHL7K0", "B004QL7JTE", "B00006FDB0", "B00H9GJSR4", "B00DJYKFXG", "B000621484", "B009EAAL60", "B0012GMUR2", "B00104AZ3M", "B00FWSWQX4", "B00DNJ99F2", "B000654YR4", "B0009WFFS6", "B000HDZK1O", "B00005UER0", "B00EUEWRZ8", "B00EO2I6T2", "0062280619", "B005MXQD0G", "B000KJU1HI", "B000I5YDBE", "B000063K0I", "B001NHZ2KM", "B00H9GJRSY", "B000F48D00", "B0000DBJDM", "B003W5C0VM", "B002RVZV9K", "B00CCEHR80", "B000BC8SVA", "B005DJ62MS", "B00078RPGW", "B00ID2TRB0", "B00000JXVL", "B001NP8PQM", "B0012GMVGM", "B00JAD6DLS", "B000021Y7X", "B000AYQJ3I", "1556524056", "B006P0FIAG", "B00BCMT0AQ", "B0000E6FOK", "B00HNTUR1S", "B000A0GP4K", "B0012GMW5M", "B000F0UTTM", "B003ELOQCK", "B002LMOCCC", "0316154490", "B00B08FLT6", "B00I5NKPWC", "B00K0X1PYM", "B009M4KTEM"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00H9GJRSY", "B001NXDSLQ", "B00003CXB1", "B0009PBLZE"]}, "price": 17.98, "categories": [["CDs & Vinyl", "Rock"], ["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 46647}, "asin": "B000305ZDO", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61TZFCBT1JL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Festival Express"}

{"description": "Norah Jones's growth as a performing artist since she burst on the scene in 2002 is apparent onNorah Jones and the Handsome Band: Live in 2004, her second concert DVD (followingLive in New Orleans, released in '03). The gifted singer-pianist-songwriter is still something of a reluctant headliner; personable if not exactly effusive (and seemingly bemused by the adulation), she's self-effacing and winningly unpretentious onstage. That goes for the music as well, as Jones and her empathetic band (now including guitarist Robbie McIntosh, formerly of the Pretenders and Paul McCartney's band) put on a tasteful, understated show at Nashville's Ryman Auditorium. Songs from her second CD,Feels Like Home, are favored, along with a version of the Grammy-winning \"Don't Know Why\" that's received with near-reverence by the audience. Jones's choice of cover material, including tunes by John Prine (\"That's the Way the World Goes 'Round\"), Tom Waits (\"The Long Way Home\"), and Gram Parsons (\"She,\" which is among the several bonus tracks; other extras include two videos and three \"mini-documentaries\"), is also admirable, but it's when her various guests show up that the show approaches genuine transcendence. Among them are Gillian Welch and David Rawlings, who harmonize beautifully with Jones on Townes Van Zandt's \"Loretta,\" and the indefatigable Dolly Parton, whose duet with Jones on bassist Lee Alexander's bluegrass-flavored \"Creepin' In\" is the undisputed highlight of the show. Radiant, ebullient, and in great voice, Parton is astar, and Norah defers to her accordingly. The only problem comes when Jones and company have to pick up where Parton left off, and in truth, it takes them a while to recover.--Sam Graham", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00008HCCF", "B001CT05KI", "B00018D44U", "B00ABYXB6A", "B003YWUTJI", "B002NWRMVS", "B000KCHZK6", "B00723NWJE", "B00005YW4H", "B005RYF5IG", "B00067OLN4", "B0016MJ6HY", "B000E6UJXS", "B00005Y3ZM", "B00G4EXNNM", "B00AV8E41W", "B001VS46DM", "B001K3JF7K", "B00K0HD7TO", "B00KO73S6W", "B00005N9CV", "B00009QI3R", "B00HF95PA4", "B0000A02WW", "B00064VR0W", "B00005KHE3", "B001G1L3SK", "B002LIKM8O", "B000F0UTTM", "B000EHQ7UG", "B000077VP2", "B000003NA4", "B00006LI4S", "B0000E1WNW", "B00023P4B0", "B000053ZRR", "B004MDYMU0", "B0007OP270", "B004E0Z4XK", "B00I5NKPWC", "B0019HQIGS", "B000SO7OL6", "B00000J7S8", "B0017XFP4U", "B0007QS2ES", "B001RTP3Z0", "B0042RUMJG", "B000003N89", "B000I0QLUA", "B00EZPCYFU", "B00006J9OT", "B0046MOV94", "B001563I5C", "B00005TNFZ", "B0052T7JP8", "B00FLDG52I", "B000148KK2", "B007NZDES0", "B001HOF8AA", "B000069HQ8", "B001UDYI2W", "B000TNJIK6", "B0042JIL2E", "B006ZPJWBM", "B005PY4ZLQ", "B00007G1V2", "1573300934", "B00CG0YLGG", "B00009VTYE", "B004J88SGC", "B00AKV1K9O", "B0084I9QIW", "B0007Y89ZM", "B00B2TUKI0", "630463949X", "B00009AQLO"], "bought_together": ["B00008HCCF", "B001CT05KI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005YW4H", "B00008HCCF", "B00018D44U", "B001CT05KI"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 174602}, "categories": [["CDs & Vinyl", "Blues", "Contemporary Blues"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Country"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Folk", "Contemporary Folk"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Jazz", "Vocal Jazz"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Pop", "Singer-Songwriters"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Pop", "Vocal Pop"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Rock"], ["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 13.1, "brand": "EMD", "asin": "B00065923K", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5120DC8GYNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Norah Jones and The Handsome Band - Live in 2004"}

{"description": "When you've got Vincent Price, Basil Rathbone, and Peter Lorre all in the same movie, how can you go wrong?Tales of Terroris a trio of Edgar Allen Poe stories, starring three of horror's greats and produced and directed by the immortal Roger Corman. The first story, \"Morella,\" involves a girl (Debra Paget) who returns to her isolated, spooky family home to see her estranged father (Price) for the first time in 26 years. He's let the housekeeping slide a bit--cobwebs abound and, oh, yes, his dead wife is still upstairs. Peter Lorre joins the fun for \"The Black Cat,\" a piece with comic flavor that allows Price to show his rarely seen silly side, and then it's Basil Rathbone's turn to be creepy in \"The Case of M. Valdemar,\" the tale of a mesmerist who decides to experiment with the unknown (bad idea). The movie is well paced, and makes good use of comedy without undercutting its chills. It's a rare treat to see this many masters of the genre working together and so clearly enjoying themselves. Don't miss it.--Ali DavisAfter the horror-triptych format proved a box-office winner inTales of Terror,Twice Told Talesrepeated the idea&#x85; this time not with Edgar Allan Poe stories, but the work of Nathaniel Hawthorne. Good idea, as Hawthorne delivered some eerie stories in his time, but the execution here is less than scintillating. The first story, \"Dr. Heidegger's Experiment,\" is the most entertaining of the bunch, in part because Vincent Price (the star of all three stories, natch) and Sebastian Cabot appear to be enjoying the premise:  two old friends discover a Fountain of Youth elixir. This will come in handy in erasing their own wrinkles and gray hair, as well as reviving the corpse of Cabot's long-dead bride&#x85; but be careful what you wish for. The second is \"Rappaccini's Daughter,\" with Price as an overly protective father with a novel way to keep his daughter from the sins of the flesh. It is fatally dull, and the final segment, a severe condensation of Hawthorne's novel \"The House of the Seven Gables,\" is even more annoying, although at least it moves along a bit.

{"description": "Michelangelo Antonioni'sL'Eclisserolls over you and wraps you in its stylish embrace.  The plot, such as it is, follows Vittoria (luscious Monica Vitti,The Red Desert) as her engagement falls apart and she slowly falls into a giddy but anxious affair with Piero (Alain Delon,Le Samourai,Purple Noon), a trader in Rome's stock exchange. Like Ingmar Bergman (Scenes from a Marriage,Persona), Antonioni examines the nuances of human relationships--but where Bergman is dense and dialogue-driven, Antonioni is spare and visual (there's maybe a page of dialogue in the first fifteen minutes ofL'Eclisse). Every frame is like an exquisite black and white photograph, yet there's nothing static about this movie. It's fluid, sleek, and graceful, achieving its own kind of visual music.L'Eclissecontrasts opposing elements: Light and shadow, noise and silence, laughter and death, love and money, desire and dissatisfaction.  Critics often describe the movie as a portrait of modern alienation, but they focus too much on Vittoria herself; while she finds her own life wanting, all around her Antonioni's camera captures a much larger world, full of as much vitality as despair, as much hope as loss. This is a movie essential to anyone's understanding of what movies can be.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005BHW6", "B00DZP1BUU", "B003D3Y64C", "B0000WN0ZK", "B00DZP1C3Q", "B003D3Y64M", "B000E33W0I", "B000AQKUG8", "B002U6DVQ2", "B005D0RDWK", "B000093NR0", "B001TK80CA", "B00092ZLEY", "B00HE011DE", "B00005JKPT", "B004WPYO7E", "B009D004TA", "B001LMU1C8", "B00005QAPH", "B0007989ZC", "B00005V6N6", "B0012KOM6K", "B004M66YUS", "B000BB14IA", "B00DHN8GGW", "B00007CVS2", "B00000IOKV", "B00009ME9Z", "B000E5LEVA", "6305081034", "0780022343", "6305744114", "B00005JKGO", "B00LCT48JC", "B000305ZYS", "B0009HLCTC", "B008Y5OVZ8", "B0002DB4YQ", "B00005QAPJ", "B00004Z1FM", "B0026VBOJW", "B000I8OOG0", "B000PKG6OO", "B001MPS7GG", "B00005UQ7T", "B00005EBSF", "B000PKG6O4", "B00HVOFP6W", "B000IHYXH6", "B0000YEEHG", "B00005M2C7", "B0007GAG42", "B0007SMDCS", "B00004WM2H", "B000G8NXYQ", "B005152C7S", "B004NWPY20", "B000BB14I0", "B005VU9LI6", "B0000BUZKP", "B0035ECHVI", "B000C8Q900", "B000PKG6OE", "B000E5LEV0", "B00AQ6J5YA", "B001LMU19G", "B000ZM1MIM", "B005VU9LP4", "B000K0YLX2", "B0001ZIVAA", "B0001UZZSQ", "B000WC39FY", "B001WLMOL4", "B00AQ6J6H6", "B000FUF7CQ", "6305257450", "B00HRISNPM", "B006MHZ46A", "B00005QAPI", "B00192QJQC", "B000A88ERS", "B000BC8SWO", "B001BEK8C4", "B0000A02TX", "B000YV1Q30", "B003VA3JTK", "0780021541", "B003VA3JTA", "B00AOO5PXO", "B000OPPADS", "B000NOK0GW", "B00HVOFP08", "B000JYW5AU", "B00005A8TX", "B004OOL73W", "B000BR6QIW", "B0002JP2OS", "B000093NQY", "B000OPPAF6", "B0007M222A"], "bought_together": ["B00005BHW6", "B00DZP1BUU"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00DZP1BUU", "B00J2PQZRQ", "B00005BHW6", "B0000YEEHG"]}, "price": 22.49, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 17349}, "asin": "B0007989Y8", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41BGc7zTTnL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "L'Eclisse (The Criterion Collection)"}

{"description": "Two years after 1963'sThe Great Escapethrilled movie audiences with a tale of Allied soldiers working cooperatively to flee a World War II-era prisoner-of-war camp, CBS found a hit situation comedy in the loosely similarHogan's Heroes. Initially dismissed by critics as being in poor taste, the half-hour show starred Bob Crane (previously known for a supporting role onThe Donna Reed Show) as Colonel Robert Hogan, leader of a resourceful band of French, British and American guests of the German Luftwaffe. Rather than sit out the war with his fellow captives, Hogan essentially used the POW camp, Stalag 13, as a base for sabotaging Nazi operations whenever possible, helping important prisoners escape, supporting the Resistance, gathering intelligence for the Allies, and generally screwing up enemy battlefield plans. The work was always dangerous, but Hogan's crew had a number of advantages: a network of underground tunnels beneath the camp (some leading to a nearby town), a flair for disguises, the complementary talents of Hogan's key staff, and the reliable idiocy of camp Commandant Klink (Werner Klemperer) and willful ignorance of lead officer Sergeant Schultz (John Banner).Season one ofHogan's Heroesfound all of these elements securely in place and the series balancing farce with suspense. Typical storylines include \"Hold the Tiger,\" in which the boys smuggle a new German Tiger Tank into the camp, disassemble it to construct a blueprint, and then reassemble it under Klink's nose. \"The Prisoner's Prisoner\" finds Hogan kidnapping a Nazi general, sneaking him into Stalag 13, and tricking him&#x97;a laMission: Impossible--to reveal troop plans. In \"The Prince from the Phone Company,\" one of Hogan's most-trusted confederates, radio operator Kinchloe (Ivan Dixon), disguises himself as an African prince trying to secure money from the Third Reich. Half the fun of these shows is watching Hogan thinking quickly on his feet whenever things start to go wrong, or when one of Klink's more intelligent superiors becomes suspicious that not everything at Stalag 13 is as under control as it seems. Besides Dixon, the other players making up Hogan's elite squad include Richard Dawson as the slightly disreputable Newkirk (with a talent for thievery), Larry Hovis as chemistry whiz Carter, and Robert Clary as the charming LeBeau.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000A6T1J0", "B000CCBCK8", "B000FSME1K", "B000NOIX7K", "B000IHYXIK", "B000EQ46HI", "B000M8N412", "B00005JNS8", "B000N6UF10", "B006OKOUX8", "B001DMVZJ4", "B000S6LTH4", "B001N26GSE", "B0009OUBPQ", "B000ERVJKO", "B0000V4906", "B001E6JC30", "B000E33VZ4", "B0012680AS", "B001LM64VK", "B000HWZ4J8", "B00008EY6N", "B000MGBSH6", "B0009UC80G", "B000UX6TKC", "B0050MB5AC", "B001BN4WHW", "B001D68NFO", "B0006BAWSI", "B0002NY8PI", "B000LE16Y4", "B000N4RAQA", "B0007YMWGY", "B000CCBCCG", "B000BGR1B4", "B00009VRF0", "B000HWZ4HU", "B004MLEYV4", "B0002NY8R6", "B001J0FVYK", "B00A2L1CKO", "B0002F6AHA", "B003PK28FM", "B000EXZFS0", "B000QUEQ6I", "B00IF0KAYS", "B000E3L7FK", "B0006N2EZK", "B000YKYT1M", "B0014BQR3I", "B000BITV1A", "B0016KCCO0", "B0009B16TO", "B000FSMEB0", "B004NJC0RK", "B000F48D0U", "B000NOIX66", "B000VDDE1I", "B00DXLO086", "B000LXGXY8", "B000LV6W00", "B000B8I9ZY", "B000G6BLDI", "B000A0GXGK", "B001JAHQGG", "B00HJQMFF6", "B000BT96OG", "B000BYRCF6", "B008KZX7W0", "B000IONJI8", "B002DPH91I", "B0006Q93BU", "B001DMVZJY", "B0006TPE1U", "B000IHYXJO", "B001DMVZKI", "B002LCOHPE", "B000E3L7EQ", "B000ASDFIQ", "B00DXLO0D6", "B00008R9MC", "B000BF0C8E", "B000ASDFIG", "B000EHSVB4", "B00009VU0F", "B008K1PX7Q", "B0007Y08P6", "B000VS6R3A", "B002OOWKVM", "B001NRPQKI", "B0006IUDXA", "B00FM4S7P4", "B008LC8RQ8", "B000B8IA3U", "B0009UC7MK", "B00GOC75YW", "B00008NV4G", "B003RHZ6CK", "B000LE16VC", "B00009PJT0"], "bought_together": ["B000A6T1J0", "B000CCBCK8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000A6T1J0", "B002L9N4O2", "B000CCBCK8", "B000IHYXIK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 20747}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 14.13, "brand": "Paramount", "asin": "B0007KIFK0", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61A72M6P9CL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Hogan's Heroes - The Complete First Season"}
{"description": "Primerwon the Grand Jury Prize at the 2004 Sundance Film Festival and has drawn repeat viewers eager to crack writer-director-star Shane Carruth's puzzler of a time-travel drama. Carruth, an engineer by training, plays inventor Aaron, whose entrepreneurial partnership with fellow brainiac Abe (David Sullivan) unexpectedly results in a process for traveling back several hours in time. The men initially use these rewind sessions to succeed in the stock market. But a dark consequence of their daily journeys eventually complicates matters.

Shot on 16mm for $7,000, the film has a tantalizing, sealed-in logic, akin toMemento, that forces viewers to see the fantastic with a certain dispassion.

{"description": "The dazed, dreamlike world of director David Gordon Green remains intact, althoughUndertowhas more story than his previous gems (All the Real Girls,George Washington). In the hot, green Georgia countryside, a man (Dermot Mulroney) lives with his two sons on a farm; their existence is shattered by the arrival of the man's Faulknerian brother (Josh Lucas), a dangerous sort with an ulterior motive. The movie that follows is likeThe Night of the Hunterfiltered through aDays of Heavenlens--there's even aHeaven-like narration provided by Jamie Bell. That's what you get for having Terrence Malick produce your movie. The plot doesn't always sit comfortably with Green's uncanny style--sometimes it feels like an intrusion on a private world of childhood--and Josh Lucas is \"actory\" in a way that most Green actors are not. Green is at his best when noticing some stray detail (the younger brother likes to arrange his books according to smell), not when connecting the dots of story. Still, the images will stick in your mind, Tim Orr's cinematography is superb, and Philip Glass provides a suitably mysterioso score.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000YV1Q2G", "B0040ILVME", "B0000AZT1G", "B000VE4UHO", "B001R88C72", "B0000YTOL2", "B000BX8R1A", "B00005JN0D", "B000OVLBGM", "B000A7Q2I2", "B001FB55XA", "B003Y5H4W0", "B00009ZPTY", "B000I2J736", "B001DN0V02", "B000DBHX4M", "B00005V8TD", "B004SEUIW4", "B00177Y9ZC", "B001ER4CQQ", "B0084CAU2O", "B0034G4P6W", "B00CBFB8SU", "B00HE00XE2", "B0002235P8", "B002MD3USC", "B002UJIY2A", "B003CJXIWS", "B0041LULL2", "B006ISJR7U", "B002SF9YUM", "B00AEFYCL4", "B003PAXOL4", "B000V6LSOA", "B0083H6AQA", "B00IKM5OYW", "B002FG9N78", "B000BQ5J2C", "B00D3LA5WG", "B00BEIYKM6", "B004AE3QYE", "B004KA1DGG", "B00FRH0H3Q", "B004OUZLGK", "B00A47BT7C", "B00005Y4RY", "B00GM5GLDW", "B0034G4P30", "B00IJS2OHM", "B004O26LAI", "B00F8PTALC", "B003EYVXTG", "B00J0IN6Z4", "B00003CXIA", "B00EL6AD5Q", "B0034G4P58", "B000M341SC", "B0009X75O2", "B00GS08X2S", "B0088EDOIK", "B003498SCQ", "B00009MEJ4", "B00K0MM4AM", "B000F8O2QU", "B00FXOO1VC", "B009SFR2QI", "B0037QGS0A", "B00H0EN98Y", "B009T3AE1Y", "B000C20VVE", "B00HUCF420", "B00HUTPKA4", "B003Y5H4R0", "B00HHYF5EI", "B00005Y6XA", "B00EL6ADGU", "B001B1UO7G", "B00D3DJIG8", "B0083V2VYG", "B00CBFB8WQ", "B00000F7E6", "B00GBT62PQ", "B00HE00ZIQ", "B005Z9MFCM", "B00HOGBXS6", "B00003CXPD", "B0001DMVBC", "6305308853", "B00G5GNZ78", "B00GHP8SH4", "B002BWP4A6", "B004ZKKKW4", "B00HF98SHG", "B003Z8ZC2A", "B002ASABF4", "B0000A2ZU3", "B000EDWLLY", "B00F6Y3DFE", "B00023P4N8", "B00HVOFP6W"], "bought_together": ["B000BX8R1A"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004KA1DGG", "B000BX8R1A", "B0000AZT1G", "B001R88C72"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 157735}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.99, "brand": "Lucas", "asin": "B0007R4T3K", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515X5FZC3FL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Undertow"}

{"description": "Taking off from an amazing true story,The Last Shotmines some pleasing inside-Hollywood gags about indie-film production. But this is no ordinary indie:  An FBI agent (Alec Baldwin) sets up an elaborate ruse to sting some mobsters in Rhode Island, by picking a screenplay from the slush pile and financing pre-production. The movie will never be made, but the bogus production will lure the mobsters into the trap. The hitch is, the starry-eyed writer-director (Matthew Broderick), cast, and crew have no idea they're part of an undercover operation--the poor saps think their ship has come in and they're actually making a movie. Adding to the joke is that Baldwin finds himself enchanted by the moviemaking world and beginning to care about his unsuspecting stooge (Broderick is at his most engaging). Writer-director Jeff Nathanson (who scriptedCatch Me if You Can) doesn't quite trust this funny set-up, sweetening the pot with too sentimental nudges, but the two stars develop a handy odd-couple chemistry. Toni Collette, as a has-been actress, and Joan Cusack, as a sharp-tongued agent, have some riotous moments.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00029LNYQ", "B006GL8MQQ", "B0002DRDBY", "B0031REQJA", "6305310335", "B00006SFK1", "B0068MNO2U", "0767810856", "B000FO0A9W", "B00DZP1C2W", "B000FFL2G6", "6305803765", "B0040J1RX6", "B0001EFV7C", "B001B7CNWE", "B002ZG977Y", "B0001US67S", "B004EPYZOO", "B001MVWFAO", "B000093FLA", "B00008AOTO", "B004A8ZWWO", "B00118T632", "B0002YLCG0", "B004HO6I2E", "B007REV4LQ", "B00BEIYLO8", "B002ZG983M", "B000FO0AA6", "B0034G4P4O", "B003UESJME"], "bought_together": ["B006GL8MQQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005LAIH4A"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 206526}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.34, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Entertainment / Touchstone", "asin": "B0007US79O", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518TYCYG6VL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Last Shot"}

{"description": "It's hard to believe, but for the first three seasons nobody really knew thatSeinfeldwas about, well, you know. It wasn't until season 4--unleashed here in a four-disc set that's equal in scope, quality, and quantity of bonus material to its predecessors--that the show really became something. In a series which can claim every installment as classic, the two-parter on disc 1 titled \"The Pitch/The Ticket\" truly stands out as a defining episode and, in retrospect, markedSeinfeld4 as the breakthrough season. It's the one where (fake) NBC executives express their interest in working with Jerry Seinfeld on a TV show, then moves to the who's-on-first shtick of George successfully pitching Jerry on creating \"a show about nothing.\" Scattered throughout the discs in commentaries by cast and creators and in numerous \"Inside Look\" documentaries, nearly everyone expresses some anxiety about the season having a story \"arc\" depicting Jerry and his \"real\" life becoming a sitcom. The show had been only marginally successful up to that point anyway, and with the edict, \"no hugging, no learning,\" still in place, maybe messing with nothing was a bad idea. What makes the arc so arch is the self-reflexive way it details the reality of Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David coming up with the concept and pitching it to (real) NBC executives as a show that really was about, well, you know. In one of the many informally informative interview segments, Jerry remembers hitting a stride during this time when a lot of crazy ideas started to make sense. \"Everything was just a wild guess,\" he says, \"and it takes a while to get confident that you're guessing pretty good. I think sometime in season 4 we realized we were guessing pretty good.\" Oh, that we could all be so good at nothing.Season 4 also gave us the episodes \"The Bubble Boy\" (\"He lives in a bubble!\"), \"The Pick\" (\"There was no pick!\"), and, perhaps most memorably, \"The Contest.\" Recalling how nervous he thought NBC might be about a show based on how long a person can remain--ahem--master of his domain, Larry David says that he kept the idea hidden for a long time. He may have had NBC sweating, but the episode goes by without anyone uttering the word that it's really about. The curmudgeonly David also observes that another famous season 4 episode, \"The Outing,\" only made it on the air due to a network \"note\" about making sure it wouldn't be offensive to homosexuals. Hence we have the addition of another standard to theSeinfeldlexicon of American pop culture: \"Not that there's anything wrong with that!\" Not only wasn't there anything wrong with it, the episode won a GLAAD Media Award. Season 4 also broughtSeinfeldits first Emmy for Outstanding Comedy Series. Stay tuned for season 5 (and a move to the coveted Thursday-at-9 slot) when the volcano we now know was always brewing really blew its comedic top.--Ted Fry", "related": {"also_bought": ["B008LCRAFC", "B0002UE1WQ", "B008LCRA7K", "B008LCRA98", "B00005JLEX", "B008LCRABQ", "B008LCRAC0", "B0002UE1X0", "B0006IUDYY", "B004D2GMVM", "B000957O8C", "B0001BS3IY", "B000BBOUF4", "B006MFQ4DE", "B000BNTM46", "B000T22PVG", "B000FBH3WC", "B000RBA6CO", "B000002VGR", "B000A0GOQ4", "B0001ZMWXW", "B000TGJ82G", "B00CJ7Y1CK", "B000067DNE", "B000SQFC0O", "B001MVWRNE", "B00070HK4C", "B00000JWVS", "B0058JEI06", "B000BYA4JW", "B007KFZ8B4", "B0002WZTLQ", "B0024FAD9M", "B0058J3S16", "B0019D151K", "B0007R4SWC", "B001B9LWME", "B003YLM79E", "B0007Y08JW", "B000M341S2", "B0007US79Y", "B00BUWD7Y8", "B0001NBNJ8", "B003CJXJ8Q", "B00BXTH474", "B00IFK7ONI", "B002E58FT2", "B00K8HAJN8", "B00067BCB8", "B00EQ2KU7G", "B003L77G9W", "B0001NBNIY", "B00008NV4G", "B009LDD1X0", "B000TZJBPQ", "B000VDDE18", "B000U1ZV76", "B001DMVZKI", "B003YLM78U", "B000B5XOUC", "B000068CNX", "B001GQ3GHG", "630529142X", "B007KFZ8AK", "B000ERVJMW", "B009LDD4BO", "B0053O89WY", "B005D0OHA6", "B002ZG971U", "B001AEF6AY", "B007KFZ8AA", "B0020TS5EM", "B007KFZ7Q0", "B008G33PIM", "B000BYCAJE", "B00DJYJRHG", "0310335280", "B003TFAJ18", "B0052C5EHK", "B003UD7JAI", "B00BT1XCOU", "B000BGR1B4", "B0000027RL", "B0089BSNVK", "B003R0MEZ4", "B0045HCJRG"], "bought_together": ["B008LCRAFC", "B008LCRA7K"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0002UE1WQ", "B008LCRAFC", "B008LCRA98", "B00EIJTLK4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 4086}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 11.98, "brand": "Columbia Tri Star", "asin": "B0007YXRCW", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/512590Q1ZAL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Seinfeld: Season 4"}

{"description": "The Emmy-winning first season was an auspicious beginning. By its second season, the classic theme song \"Love is All Around\" has been revamped with an even more optimistic outlook: \"You're gonna make it after all.\" In the sophomore season of this instant gold-standard sitcom, the ace writing staff and peerless ensemble begin to flesh out the iconic characters. Gruff Lou Grant (Ed Asner, enjoying his second Emmy-winning season) reveals his more loveable side when he discovers his son-in-law out with another woman in \"The Six-and-a-Half-Year Itch.\" Vain Ted Baxter (Ted Knight) becomes a more sympathetic character in \"Cover Boy,\" featuring the hilariously preening Jack Cassidy as Ted's competitive brother, and \"And Now, Sitting in for Ted Baxter,\" in which a substitute anchor earns higher ratings than the vacationing Ted. Mary, the sweetheart of prime time, is still something of a pushover (in \"Feeb,\" she feels compelled to write a letter of recommendation for an extraordinarily incompetent secretary), but she develops the backbone to stand up to an anti-Semite who disapproves of Rhoda in one of the season's best episodes, \"Some of My Best Friends Are Rhoda.\" The indelible friendship between Mary and Rhoda (Valerie Harper, also earning her second consecutive Emmy) is sorely tested when they become temporary roommates in \"Where There's Smoke, There's Rhoda.\" As with the most enduring shows,The Mary Tyler Moore Showeschewed topical humor that would date the series, and instead, mined its more universal and timeless humor from the wellspring of the characters. More than 30 years later, there is still, as ever, something aboutMary.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000BOH8YQ", "B00005JLIC", "B000EXDS02", "B0011N19HI", "B002WN8IR0", "B003VTKZ84", "B001O4KBN2", "B000A9QKSM", "B000E6ES9Y", "B000YKYT1M", "B002C8YSBU", "B000G6BL7O", "B003CNQPME", "B00144K5M4", "B000QUEQ6I", "B00009VRF0", "B000EQ5PTQ", "B0001IN0BC", "B0000AUXVS", "B00GHH9HW2", "B00KTZALDC", "B0000AZKKP", "B00016XN48", "B00HNGC56G", "B0007WFY4S", "B0006Q93BU", "B001OXLGK0", "B002E58FT2", "B00HRUQB5O", "B004083REE", "B000MGBSH6", "B0002NY8R6", "B002E58FTW", "B0030ATZH6", "B002E58FTM", "B00008EYBH", "B000Z27H8Q", "B000291Q3O", "B000TD0PHG", "B00023B1WQ", "1451659202", "1451659229", "B002E58FTC", "B000F8O2MO", "B000H6SY28", "B00FM4S7P4", "B00274SIVK", "B000A0GOP0", "B001DMVZKI", "B004ES6TBS", "B000MQ4WMY", "B009GGWW3W", "B0000V4906", "B00005JO3P", "B000B5XOUM", "B0007TKG76", "B002E58FU6", "B005E7SEOI", "B003CNQPMY", "B000E3L7EQ", "B0007KTBJO", "B000CELOV8", "B002E58FUG", "B0028S110A", "B000ASDFIQ", "B00JHH1VUU", "B00GOC74I4", "B002OOWKVM", "B000B8I9ZY", "B000NTMA1U", "B0014FAIYS", "B000TXPXCS", "B0054602ZI", "B001N26GSE", "B000AJJNJK", "B00GOC74QG", "B000EBGFQI", "B000C1VBAA", "B003JHXS5A", "B002OOWKYE", "B000M343AS", "B000AL733G", "B0011FLGYM", "B0007WFXL2", "B0006TPE1U", "B000UX6TKM", "B00H4ZEJ6K", "B001O4KBNM", "B000E3L7FK", "B0031XYLR6", "B0002Y4T7O", "B002ACKBTG", "B000VS6R30", "B000FA57U8", "B00H8KC1N4", "B00008EY6N", "B00IXPWGIS", "B000BYRCF6", "B008VNI9TC", "B00A2L1CJK"], "bought_together": ["B00005JLIC", "B000BOH8YQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005JLIC", "B000BOH8YQ", "B006363QHE", "B000EXDS02"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 26138}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 14.25, "brand": "20TH CENTURY FOX HOME ENTMNT", "asin": "B00096S480", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510AE11R2PL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Mary Tyler Moore Show - The Complete Second Season (1971)"}

{"description": "Three seasons into it,The Dead Zonehas cemented its stature as one of television's most ambitious and compelling series, combining action, psychological drama, and elements of sci-fi and the supernatural in twelve episodes contained on three discs in this handsome, bonus-filled package.  Based on Stephen King's 1979 novel (later a feature film starring Christopher Walken),The Dead Zonewas adapted for TV by Michael and Shawn Piller, with actor Anthony Michael Hall (previously best known for his roles in the mid-'80s hitsThe Breakfast ClubandSixteen Candles) as star, co-producer, and occasional director. Hall ably plays Johnny Smith, who has recovered from a six-year coma to discover that he now has some rather remarkable powers; merely by touching other people, or objects touched by others, Smith has visions that illuminate events that have happened, will happen, or that are taking place elsewhere. He has put this ability to use as a psychic, working with the police in the Maine town in which the stories take place.Understanding all of this may take a while for the uninitiated; not only does Smith jump both forward and back in time, but he often sees himself in his visions, and sometimes we're watching the Johnny of the present with the one from the past onscreen at the same time.The Dead Zonehas a lot on its hands in each episode, with a stand-alone storyline (a Rep. Gary Condit-Chandra Levy takeoff in \"Finding Rachel,\" a Columbine-esque school shooting in \"Cycle of Violence\") balancing the ongoing matter of Smith's visions--how they came to be (\"Collision\" details the car accident that led to his coma and, eventually, his powers), how to interpret them, and whether they're a blessing or a curse. All of that is mixed together with his strange new personal life (his pregnant fianc&#xE9;, played by Nicole De Boer, married the local sheriff while Johnny was out of commission). And then there's the overriding series theme, which is heavily featured in the first two episodes of this season but mentioned only occasionally thereafter: Armageddon is coming, Johnny alone lives through it, he might even cause it&#x85; and maybe he's the only one who can prevent it.It's a tough act to pull off week after week, but while the show occasionally seems about to collapse under its own weight, it mostly succeeds, albeit without a shred of humor and an ultra-serious, portentous vibe that gets a little tedious. At the very least,The Dead Zonemakes for consistently intriguing viewing. The generous bonus features include commentary (by Hall and many others) for every episode, three featurettes, and more.--Sam Graham", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000F3UAE8", "B0001907BC", "B000OCXNQW", "B00166UFTI", "B000092T3Y", "B00006JU81", "B000NOKFGW", "B0037AGB9O", "B0081QF6Q8", "B00AEFXR8I", "B0056GLNQI", "B000ERVJLS", "B00133QNSG", "B00JDCP0QA", "B0077PTWY6", "B00062IDEW", "B000N3T0EG", "B00133QNS6", "B0077PTWHI", "B000FJH5M2", "B000FS9MY2", "B003LXM1B4", "B000FOPPBA", "B000TGURZ8", "B00GOC74QG", "B000EWBNMS", "B000MX7V66", "B000FIHN8O", "B0011FLH00", "B00133QNRW", "B002KQ6UE2", "B001CQONMC", "B0013DZNAA", "B000E3L7F0", "B001QE99BA", "B0012Z36F8", "B001A7GOCA", "B007PKSNEI", "B000GFLEKY", "B0012IXBNC", "B00369ERC4", "B000E5N6B6", "B0038MUZ3E", "B002QZDSW4", "B00CKJJ1IG", "B004SMDJ9U", "B00F4CIPRE", "B0030VANIU", "B00JK47BHM", "B0077PTWH8", "B00KTFJ6J2", "B001RXDM2M", "B005PPMHO2", "B0051GOB2G", "B00ESK1PES", "B00DPJEWD4", "B001RHGRU2", "B0006UEVTK", "B00JF5GAIW", "B00IWTVDUW", "B00GOC752E", "B003L77GWE", "B0016OOM6W", "B00E96AYYS", "B003LXM1PK", "B0077PTWX2", "B000T9OP7G", "B000GYI340", "B00JHH1VDC", "B003PGNBO8", "B008H1Q61G", "B0002S94BQ", "B002BWP2IK", "B00CRX82LM", "B00B4804LM", "B000FUTVPA", "B00CKJJ1G8", "B00HUPC5X8", "B00E8OMZGG", "B000JLTRHW", "B00540G3GG", "B005DCJ0Q0", "B0012IX35S", "B0077PTX0E", "B003L77H1Y", "B001ILFUB4", "B0009X76ZA", "B00242KD1S", "B003R0MEYA", "B001AQR3J4", "B00020H9NO", "B00IS6WQ2S", "B0085KGG96", "B00915G6TE", "B00022FWEU", "B001MVWRN4", "B001AQO43M", "B002QU1Z1K", "B00HUCF7AO"], "bought_together": ["B000F3UAE8", "B0001907BC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000F3UAE8", "B000OCXNQW", "B000092T3Y", "B00166UFTI"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 60352}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 4.7, "brand": "Vidmark/Trimark", "asin": "B0009A407A", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51I27Ca1G-L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Dead Zone - The Complete Third Season"}

{"description": "One of the essential films of the 1990s, Mike Leigh's brilliant and controversial \"Naked\" stars David Thewlis as Johnny, a charming, eloquent, and relentlessly vicious drifter in London.

With a virtuoso script and raw performances by Thewlis and costars Katrin Cartlidge and Lesley Sharp, Leigh's panorama of England's crumbling underbelly is a showcase of black comedy and doomsday prophecy, and was the winner of the best director and actor prizes at the 1993 Cannes Film Festival.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00BJB2GRO", "B0058EA3MS", "B0007P0YKY", "B00HE011DE", "B004SIP84S", "B00GPPXNIK", "B00007KK3X", "B0009X75LA", "630589423X", "B00LEW3L5Y", "B00HVOFP6W", "B005KQVE1S", "B000093NQZ", "B0007989ZC", "B00003CXKS", "B00005NC66", "B00DZP1BUU", "B004ALIG4M", "0780022629", "B00GBT637S", "B003552QWC", "B00005NFZD", "0780022343", "B007N5YJMA", "B00F98FOI6", "B0006HBZD8", "B0000CDUT5", "B0007WFYB6", "B003WKL6XA", "B00274O88W", "B004WPYO7E", "B00AQ6J6H6", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B007C3TVNA", "6305228884", "B003UESJIS", "B004CIIXC8", "B00005JH9B", "B00005QAPH", "B00EO2I6SI", "B00GBT62PQ", "B00IKM5MIA", "B005VU9LP4", "B008Y5OVZ8", "B006TTC5A4", "B00DHN8GGW", "B00005BHW6", "B0007GAG42", "B000093NR0", "B001LMU1C8", "B00007CVS2", "B00DHN8G3U", "B000E5LEV0", "B001CW7ZT4", "B000VARC32", "B0000BUZKP", "B00G7QPXUI", "B001GCATWK", "B001LMU19G", "B0002JP2OS", "B00DHN8FXG", "B000934FC2", "B0035ECHPO", "B00K5EJHGO", "B0035ECHVI", "B00005EBSF", "B0083V2W6I", "B000OPPADS", "B00005K3NV", "B00HE010LC", "B00CEIOHPU", "B000CBG5PG", "B0000A02TX", "B004NWPY20", "B00AQ6J5YA", "B003D63G6S", "B004XVMCKS", "B000BR6QCI", "B0002I83Z4", "B000025RE7", "B0001GH5TW", "B000SFJ4HW", "B00HE010QM", "B00023P4I8", "B0002DB52M", "0780023277", "B000LP6KNU", "B00B2BYXSQ", "B0000AINJ8", "B00049QJ9I", "B004ALIG4W", "B000083C5F", "B0006Z2NB8", "B004ALIG1U", "B000069CF9", "B000BR9S96", "0783228457", "B0002V7O10", "B002IVDLGY", "B002U6DVPS"], "bought_together": ["B00BJB2GRO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00BJB2GRO", "0783225903", "B00H83EUQW", "B000UBMSB8"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 98162}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 24.25, "brand": "Image Entertainment", "asin": "B000A88EV4", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41J3BC9ESFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Naked (The Criterion Collection)"}
{"description": "The axe of cancellation dangled perilously overArrested Developmentduring its second season, but the award-winning comedy fought against fate to deliver a hilarious if scattershot 18 episodes (reduced from the original show order of 22), and stayed alive for the  beginning of a third season. Most likely, the creators and actors knew the clock was ticking down, so they didn't hesitate to throw their all into these manic, hilarious episodes, which have only the thinnest of plot arcs but an electrifying energy that makes them hard to resist. Some of the story antics were more of the same: good son Michael (Jason Bateman) tries to keep his company afloat, but is often foiled by older brother Gob (Will Arnett); the precarious marriage of Lindsay (Portia de Rossi) and Tobias (David Cross) undergoes a trial separation; and young George-Michael (Michael Cera) fights his attraction to his cousin Maeby (Alia Shawkat). Other show developments, though, were new and stunningly, uproariously bizarre: Buster (Tony Hale) joins the army, but later finds his hand bitten off by a seal (yes, a real seal), and Oscar (Jeffrey Tambor), the hippie brother of jailed George Sr. (also Tambor), rekindles an affair with sister-in-law Lucille (Jessica Walter), which may have resulted in Buster's conception years ago.Jokes flew fast and furious, as did guest stars--Ben Stiller, Julia Louis-Dreyfuss, Christine Taylor, Thomas Jane, Ed Begley Jr., Ione Skye, and Zach Braff among them--making it hard to keep straight who was doing what and why. No matter, as each of the episodes was in and of itself was a perfect gem of comedy, strung together by sharp writing and fantastic performances. In addition to the regular cast, both Liza Minnelli, reprising her role as \"Lucille Two,\" and Martin Short, as an, um, eccentric family friend, deserve special mention, with the episode both appeared in, \"Ready, Aim, Marry Me,\" a frenetic exercise in slapstick farce. Typical examples of the show's offbeat humor were found in \"Afternoon Delight,\" in which various members of the Bluth family discover the true meaning of the '70s ballad, \"Meet the Veals,\" wherein the Bluths encounter the conservative parents of George Michael's girlfriend, and \"Motherboy XXX,\" surrounding an unsettling mother-son traditional dance. The entire cast cohered perfectly through this season, and their give and take provided a perfect balance among the actors, all of whom were even better than the previous year. However, it's Bateman who should be singled out as the show's anchor, mixing dry sarcasm with impeccable comic timing. Despite plummeting ratings,Arrested Developmentdidn't just keep its head above water, it swam with grace and hilarity.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000EXDS7K", "B0002PYS7Y", "B000RBA6CO", "B00ICR6SBI", "B000RW3VDE", "B001B9LWME", "B002DPPH6W", "B0024FAD9M", "B0018RKEQE", "B002N5N5KW", "B003L77GE2", "B0002W4P98", "B001L1S1PS", "B0053O8ACS", "B002N5N5NE", "B009LDD40U", "B000SINT4S", "B000AJJNI6", "B002N5N5SO", "B000GPIPTM", "B0024FAD9W", "B00005JNEQ", "B0009VBTP0", "B000FFJYE8", "B002N5N5PM", "B001VPJYZ0", "B0058JEHTS", "B003L77GJM", "B001DPHDBU", "B003R4ZMOA", "B003L77GDS", "B000U1ZV1W", "B001DJLCRC", "B003UD7JDA", "B003L77GBU", "B000EBGFPY", "B000GETTKM", "B001AEF6AY", "B000NOKFH6", "B008L0YMZA", "B000WZEZGI", "B000TGURZ8", "B0058JEHSO", "B007QU37LG", "B00BT1XCOU", "B00005JNOG", "B000083C6V", "B000NNK4DM", "B001RTSPVY", "B00166UFSY", "B009LDCVJU", "B003DZX46G", "B0032UYFA6", "B0012CJQY6", "B0033WH6MW", "B00443FN1A", "B00005ALS0", "B000Q6GUKW", "B00AB65SVE", "B000BNI90Y", "B00008PHCU", "B007CO5MVE", "B003L77GTC", "B005OZIV20", "B001YYQA0K", "B002EOVX9W", "B0014WAAE4", "B002LITRJ4", "B002AMVED8", "B002JVWQSW", "B0007PALZ2", "B0058YPG1G", "B000G6BL88", "B000HT3P6U", "B007KFZ7UQ", "B000XA5K48", "B004SUDPXW", "B0001I9Y8U", "B003ES5JH4", "B009LDD4BO", "B001NOMOS8", "B0053O8A78", "B0000797E5", "B00008YGRS", "B007C8RZL0", "B0000E2PVR", "B0012EBVAG", "B001OQCVFG", "B00120LPP6", "B002N5N5LG", "B00123BY6S", "B0060MYKYY", "B00475B0G2", "B004P9UWM8", "B00EEDNR9A", "B00009KNU5", "B003L77G06", "B000P12LWY", "B002OOWKSU", "B007C8RZQ0"], "bought_together": ["B000EXDS7K", "B0002PYS7Y"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0002PYS7Y", "B000EXDS7K", "B00EPH8S58", "B0009VBTP0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 17018}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 12.96, "brand": "TCFHE", "asin": "B000A9QKRI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51iIxr%2BTyvL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Arrested Development: Season 2"}
{"description": "When it premiered on CBS on October 2, 1955,Alfred Hitchcock Presentswas an instant hit destined for long-term popularity. The series' original half-hour anthology format provided a perfect showcase for stories of mystery, suspense, and the macabre that reflected Hitchcock's established persona. Every Sunday at 9:30 p.m., the series began with the familiar theme of Gounod's \"Funeral March of a Marionette\" (which would thereafter be inextricably linked with Hitchcock), and as Hitchcock's trademark profile sketch was overshadowed by the familiar silhouette of Hitchcock himself, the weekly \"play\" opened and closed with the series' most popular feature: As a good-natured host whose inimitable presence made him a global celebrity, Hitchcock delivered droll, dryly sardonic introductions and epilogues to each week's episode, flawlessly written by James Allardyce and frequently taking polite pot-shots at CBS sponsors, or skirting around broadcast standards (which demanded that no crime could go unpunished) by humorously explaining how the show's killers and criminals were always brought to justice... though always with a nod and a wink to the viewer.This knowing complicity was Hitchcock's pact with his audience, and the secret to his (and the series') long-term success. It's also what attracted a stable of talented writers whose teleplays, both original and adapted, maintained a high standard of excellence. Hitchcock directed four of the first season's 39 episodes, including the premiere episode \"Revenge\" (a fan favorite, with futurePsychocostar Vera Miles) and the season highlight \"Breakdown,\" with Joseph Cotten as a car-accident victim, paralyzed and motionless, who's nearly left for dead; it's a perfect example of visual and narrative economy, executed with a master's touch. (The fourth episode, \"Don't Come Back Alive,\" is also a popular favorite, with the kind of sinister twist that became a series trademark.) Robert Stevenson directed the majority of the remaining episodes with similar skill, serving tightly plotted tales (selected by associate producers Joan Harrison and Norman Lloyd) by such literary greats as Ray Bradbury, Robert Bloch, Cornell Woolrich, Dorothy L. Sayers, and John Collier. Adding to the series' prestige was a weekly roster of new and seasoned stars, with first-season appearances by Cloris Leachman, Darren McGavin, Everett Sloane, Peter Lawford, Charles Bronson, Barry Fitzgerald, John Cassavetes, Joanne Woodward, Thelma Ritter, and a host of Hollywood's best-known character players. With such stellar talent on weekly display,Alfred Hitchcock Presentspaved the way forThriller,The Twilight Zone, and other series that maximized the anthology format's storytelling potential.Packed onto three double-sided DVDs, these 39 episodes hold up remarkably well, and while some prints show the wear and tear of syndication, they look and sound surprisingly good (although audio compression will cause many viewers to turn up the volume). The 15-minute bonus featurette, \"Alfred Hitchcock Presents: A Look Back\" is perfunctory at best, but it's nice to see new anecdotal interviews with Norman Lloyd, assistant director Hilton Green, and Hitchcock's daughter Pat (a frequent performer on these episodes), who survived to see their popular series benefit from the archival convenience of DVD.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000HDR814", "B000TXPXD2", "B002NPY7GS", "B005UL4NF2", "B00FEOYY8G", "B003NOGNQU", "B0002CX1M0", "B00BI3XZA0", "B0007CEXUY", "B001DXS4DI", "B002GSXKQA", "B000UVV25Q", "B000H5U5EE", "B006TBYC76", "B00KTZALDC", "B000A9QK7I", "B001HNDR4A", "B003VJTGNE", "B00BQK4YDC", "B005EVY8MQ", "B0002HOEPS", "B000A1INJE", "B0002NRRRE", "B00C6F61S2", "B000TJBNF8", "B00EEEHLKU", "B00JKTFQJM", "B000BC8T1E", "B001D8W7F4", "B00009VRF0", "B00IU6HQ4O", "B000MGBSDK", "B00CPTUN8S", "B00KBES386", "B007I8KXQ8", "B004CQZFL2", "B00JEZWRE4", "B0002J4ZX2", "B002DMJM7K", "B00016XN48", "B00068NVLQ", "B008OIQYXM", "B009OE2O0C", "B000F48D0U", "B00KE3B9US", "B00005JO3P", "B005D7E7Y0", "B00308B170", "B0030BS1E8", "B004IB04S0", "B00HQLZCIQ", "B0016MOWNM", "B00F6D62O4", "B009OE2NZI", "B00005JN8Q", "B000BQ5IXW", "B0008ENID4", "B001D8W7EK", "B00DZP1C18", "B0012KSUUO", "B00AQMGQVY", "B009OE2ODY", "B00BDZV4OW", "B00005JLIC", "B00E5G03I4", "B000QTCY7M", "B0044A5BPQ", "B005NHZAXM", "B008I34Y3K", "B001992NXI", "B001CQONOA", "B000IHYXJO", "B0002COTDA", "B00096S480", "B002ACKBU0", "B000LE16VC", "B005BUA1F8", "B000BF0C7A", "B009OE2NS0", "B008DCAG9M", "B005LVIP1E", "B001BN4WHW", "B000BGR1B4", "B009GGWW3W", "B00ARA4SLU", "B00BAXTYI0", "B000PHX5KU", "B001SLNPSO", "B001JAHPMG", "B000OPOAKW", "B00000JNUZ", "B001E6HUWK", "B00G5N6C8U", "B00000C0QO", "B00009Y3RE", "B000LXGXY8", "B008MIYKS0", "B000MGBSQM", "B000ECX0O2", "B00GSMZ3I8"], "bought_together": ["B000HDR814", "B000TXPXD2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005UL4NF2", "B000TXPXD2", "B002NPY7GS", "B00FEOYY8G"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 30917}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 21.25, "brand": "HITCHCOCK,ALFRED", "asin": "B000AL733G", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41nEauPqQpL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Alfred Hitchcock Presents - Season One"}

{"description": "How is it possible that11:14went virtually unreleased in theaters? After modest film-festival exposure, it played briefly in San Francisco in August 2005 (over two years after it was completed), but that's a cruel twist of fate for such a cleverly twisted movie about cruel twists of fate. Destined for sleeper status on DVD (and given a slightly higher profile by Hilary Swank's subsequent Oscar-winning performance inMillion Dollar Baby), the audacious debut of writer-director Greg Marcks boasts a fantastic cast in a smartly constructed comedy/thriller, partly inspired byBlood Simple, in which a fatal traffic accident is examined and re-examined from multiple perspectives. The flashback structure involves all of the characters and events that lead up to the accident's deadly occurrence at 11:14 on an otherwise pleasant evening in Middleton, a typical suburb of Anytown, USA (filmed in the vicinity of Los Angeles). Marcks's screenplay attracted an impressive ensemble cast (costar Swank also signed on as an executive producer), and they're all given equal time as the intertwined plots are revealed. They include Rachael Leigh Cook (whose bad-girl behavior sets the chain of events in motion); Patrick Swayze and Barbara Hershey as her worried parents; Swank and Shawn Hatosy as would-be criminals with a dimwit plan; Henry Thomas as a drunk driver whose involvement is deeper than we realize; and Colin Hanks as one of three teenage vandals on a fast track to trouble. With falling corpses, graveyard sex, reckless gunplay, and a severed penis, it's all in good, grisly fun (apart from intricate plotting, Marcks has no lofty agenda up his sleeve), and there's ultimately not much point to its random misfortune, but11:14is clearly the work of a promising filmmaker, worthy of rediscovery on DVD.

If it was ever in question, don't worry, most everyone will get the chance to disrobe (some more than once) and offer up an important clue before being knocked off.   Of course all of the standard questions are raised.  Who is the mysterious killer? What's the horrifying secret behind the sadistic rampage of death?  Who will live to find out?All of the essential  \"Giallo\" trademarks are in place; The faceless leather-gloved killer, mysterious phone calls with cryptic muffled warnings, the screeching black car appearing out of nowhere (run for your life!), numerous red herrings, sexy and scantily clad (if clad at all) victims, gruesome elaborate murder sequences, and of course the requisite \"surprise\" ending in which \"all \" is neatly explained. Unfortunately what the film lacks is any likeable characters or any trace of suspense, and the story's premise has been used before in a much better offering, Massimo Dallamano'sWhat Have You Done to Solange?Still, there are some good scares, brisk pacing, nice camerawork, and an atmospheric jazzy score by Berto Persano.Strip Nude for Your Killermay not qualify as one of Italy's  greatest cinematic achievements, but likeTiramisu, this is certainly grade-A fluff.--Matt Wold", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000E41MTU", "B000YKI4T0", "B004WMOSKA", "B0002Y69VI", "B000E41MTA", "B000E41MT0", "B000KRNG54", "B0012IV3S2", "B000MV8ZCW", "1598830392", "B000V6LT6C", "B0000640SM", "B000BB1926", "B002E01MHY", "B004H0M34A", "B007ATHNR2", "B000B64TZA", "B005DKS20M", "B000S0GYRK", "B000HXDWNM", "B004FUPK6U", "B000083C4M", "B00005R5GQ", "B00K1L4NBU", "B000S0GYRA", "B000KN9F6W", "B001B1Q3LC", "B000LC3IWY", "B000092T66", "B000V6LT5S", "B008BWFOXM", "B002TLRG6E", "B001D5C1R6", "B000KRNG4A", "B008H1Q3JG", "B001B1Q3LM", "B006HLBCDA", "B001PQT3AG", "B000TZJCNM", "B005ZHBEPI", "B000E41MTK", "B000YKI4TA", "B0006Q947S", "B00CPTUNUG", "B00JJOY47I", "B004KDYR20", "B005DZKE9E", "B0002JP2SO", "B001D5C1OO", "B00GOT15IM", "B000092T69", "B000063K1F", "B00JJOY45U", "B00KDU8HQQ", "B00E3H3CO2", "B000096I9W", "B000TZJCNC", "B000MGBSN0", "B0036R92US", "B0009S2KJC", "B000YKI4SQ", "B000MV8ZDQ", "B000096I9V", "B00CLIAACC", "B001QMCJ4Q", "B0013K2ZD6", "B0002C9DJK", "B00BCMT2BI", "B001B187H0", "B0024R1R8G", "B00FGAKEU0", "B009R68H80", "B0002C9DJU", "B00C1PKRJ6", "B0002Y69V8", "B00000JT2R", "B0018BA72G", "B0009ETD1O", "B00HW3EJ6Y", "B001LIK8DO", "B006P4GHWA", "B0000AINPE", "B000EQ5UB4", "B000S0GYRU", "B00008975Y", "B000JU7JIW", "B004XIWRW4", "B007UQ8IQU", "B000096I9X", "B00JHH1VSW", "B0063E005W", "B0002C9DK4", "B000795JMS", "B007XF0XT8", "B00FMDL4UK", "B003FP0XV8", "B0072GPQ8G", "B00IPAORFG", "B00DNJ957Y", "B0012IV3SC"], "bought_together": ["B000E41MTU", "B000YKI4T0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004WMOSKA", "B0002Y69VI", "B000YKI4T0", "B0007WQHI0"]}, "price": 17.98, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 193903}, "asin": "B000B64TZK", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516EPTWKYML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Strip Nude for Your Killer"}

{"description": "With Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson as a pair of brazen wedding crashers, this buddy/romantic comedy milks a few big laughs from its foolproof premise. Under the direction of David Dobkin (who previously worked with Wilson onShanghai Knights), the movie ranges from bawdy romp to mushy romance, and that tonal identity crisis curtails the overall hilarity. But when the well-teamed costars are firing on all pistons with fast-paced dialogue and manic situations, belly laughs are delivered at a steady clip. Things get complicated when the guys infiltrate the family of the Treasury Secretary (Christopher Walken), resulting in a romantic pair-off between Vaughn and the congressman's oversexed daughter Gloria (Isla Fisher) while Wilson sincerely woos another daughter, Claire (Rachel McAdams), who's unhappily engaged to an Ivy League cheater (Bradley Cooper). Walken is more or less wasted in his role, but Jane Seymour and Henry Gibson make amusing appearances, and a surprise guest arrives late in the game for some over-the-top scene-stealing. It's all a bit uneven, but McAdams (considered by some to be \"the next Julia Roberts\") is a pure delight, and with enough laughs to make it easily recommended,Wedding Crasherswill likely find its place on DVD shelves alongside other flawed but enjoyable R-rated comedies that embrace a naughtier, nastier brand of humor with no need for apologies.--Jeff ShannonVince Vaughn's MoviesWhy We Love Rachel McAdamsOwen Wilson's MoviesThe SoundtrackThe Return of Crass ComedyThe 40-Year-Old Virgin", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEFYS2M", "B000ELJAEM", "B00466HN7M", "B008R65XNS", "B00005JNZU", "B00006FMUW", "B000J4P9P8", "B002ZGW92E", "B001G5T6GW", "B000WZEZGI", "B002Q4VBPQ", "B00003CXSM", "B001TUZD8O", "B000HCPS94", "B001C0JCBA", "B0009HBPN0", "B001OD4S50", "B00005JMYI", "B00005JG6N", "B004EPZ084", "B0015I2RT8", "B00AEFYAMA", "B00AEBB8NS", "B00AEFXJS6", "B000069CF0", "B000TZJBPQ", "B00003CXO1", "B001C5LLQ4", "B0009OL7Z4", "B0007RT9M6", "B00005JMW7", "B001J9KJ4I", "B0006GANPA", "B003Y5H574", "B000BKJ762", "B000E6EHE0", "B003Y5H524", "B000ICM5X0", "B00AEFY7I2", "B002K0WBXW", "B00AEBB9K0", "B000VXWX7E", "B0013D8LHC", "B004HO6I2E", "B001DPHDB0", "B0016MOV92", "B00AEFYM2S", "B004EPZ070", "B000JJ4DNW", "B003CRM6PA", "B00BEIYMZ6", "B008R65XMO", "B00005JMX6", "B00AEBBA2C", "B004EPZ06G", "B004EPYZS0", "B003Y5H5B0", "B00024JC4E", "B0000AKCKI", "B000957O82", "B00AEFYQE2", "B00DV2MVWO", "B00AEBB8FQ", "B001L9EXTS", "B0041KKYGU", "B00AEFZ3XU", "B002U4UYZA", "B000CPH9PM", "B000EMGJAO", "B000M341QE", "B008R65XUQ", "B00005JMCT", "B001AKTZW8", "B00008WJD6", "B00AEFYSL8", "B002P413IC", "B00AEFXVW0", "B002ZG99H2", "B0000A02TZ", "B005LAII12", "B001SN78JO", "B008JFUORW", "B000LC3ICE", "B002T9H2LA", "B0051MKNRC", "B003HKN52U", "B000CCBCAS", "B00AEFYZCU", "B002ZG980U", "B00AEFY99O", "B002VWNIEA", "B0000524E5", "B004AV5GX6", "B000A343RI", "B000EMGJ7C", "B004LWZW5G", "B00AEFXDO6", "B00000K3UU", "B004SIP95G", "B0009RCPUW"], "bought_together": ["B00AEFYS2M"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00466HN7M", "B001G5T6GW", "B003Y5H5B0", "B000J4P9P8"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 92528}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.95, "brand": "New Line Home Video", "asin": "B000BKVQRU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Z2E7093FL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Wedding Crashers (R-Rated Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "InRaising Cain, the two-hour documentary based on thebook by the same title, Dr. Michael Thompson discusses how the educational system and today's cultural circumstances are not equipping America's boys with the right tools to development emotionally.  If society and the school system stay on their current path, the boys of America are headed for trouble.  The lack of positive \"father figures\" in most American homes, the removal of physical education and recess in schools, a school system geared more toward girls' educational development, and the emotional confusion many boys face when growing up with without any adult male guidance are all contributing factors to American boys' decline in classroom performance, rise in violent outbreaks, and inability to communicate inner feelings. To get to the heart of the issue, Dr. Thompson proposes that by understanding the psychology of boys, we can help get them on track.  To get his point across, Dr. Thompson interviews the lives of various \"real boys\" from birth through high school, of different race and socio-economical backgrounds. His candid interviews reveal the many challenges and confusion all boys encounter while growing up in America.  At the end of each section, Dr. Thompson defines ways for parents, educators, and counselors to engage boys and help them discuss many of the internal issues they are conflicted with. This excellent documentary is a real eye-opener and does an effective job pointing out the issues many parents do not feel comfortable talking about, nor understand how to address.Raising Cainis highly recommended to any parent, particularly those that are raising boys.--Rob Bracco", "related": {"also_bought": ["0345434854", "B002TCRQ5E", "0345493966", "0345441486", "B0016NOUZQ", "034544289X", "B000EBFVYU", "0345424573", "0345524926", "034551369X", "0345493958", "0345450132", "1594481881", "B00BCV3JWW", "B004MCGNRQ", "158761328X", "B002Y7ZELW", "B003H3D1BW", "B0027JCWSA", "B0013MOLQ8", "0307381293", "0805061835", "B000DN5WTI", "B000DN5WTS", "B00A4TMLKE", "B0030BYWU0", "B0038M2AZA", "B0018QOIWG", "0736957804", "B003B3NGS6", "0787995282", "1580052347", "B00004U104", "0553527142", "1482552957", "188914021X"], "bought_together": ["0345434854"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0345434854", "0345493966", "034544289X", "034551369X"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 85533}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 22.45, "brand": "PBS", "asin": "B000CPHAB0", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51814Y3C1TL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Raising Cain: Exploring the Inner Lives of America's Boys  PBS Home Video"}
{"description": "A decade after their last hilarious short, the Oscar-winningA Close Shave, Claymation wonders Wallace and Gromit return for a full-length adventure. Daffy scientist Wallace (voiced by Peter Sallis) and his heroic dog Gromit are doing well with their business, Anti-Pesto, a varmint-hunting outfit designed to keep their English town safe from rabbits chomping on prized vegetables. Wallace meets Lady Tottington (Helena Bonham Carter), who appreciates Wallace's humane way of dealing with rabbits (courtesy of the Bun-Vac 6000), and sets up a rivalry with the gun-toting Victor Quartermaine (Ralph Fiennes, enjoying himself more than ever). Creator Nick Park, with co-director/writer Steve Box, delivers a story worthy of the 85-minute running time, although it stretches the act a bit; the formula plays better shorter, but the literally hand-crafted film is a joy to watch. Taking a chapter from classic horror films, a giant were-rabbit is soon on the prowl, and the town is up in arms, what with the annual vegetable contest close at hand. (Anyone who's seen the previous three shorts knows who saves the day.) Never content to do something simply when the extravagant will do, W&G;'s lives are filled with whimsical Rude Goldberg-style devices, and the opening number showcasing their alarm system is pure Aardman Animation at its finest. Even though there's a new twist here--a few mild sight gags aimed at adults--this G-rated film will delight young and old alike as Park, like team Pixar, seems incapable of making anything but an outstanding film.--Doug ThomasSee more clay animation and Wallace &amp; Gromit titles...Director Nick Park on DVDStop-Motion &amp; Clay Animation TitlesWallace &amp; GromitStuff Galore", "related": {"also_bought": ["B006W4KVI4", "B002DPVI0Q", "B001LXIDTK", "B00003CXJ4", "B001LXIDTA", "B001LXIDT0", "B002DR2GJQ", "B000M343BC", "B000W089WO", "B001OC6RZA", "B001F0TT8I", "B004AGN9MG", "B000AA4JNE", "B002ZG4QDE", "B000A2UBOI", "B003BJODIC", "B004KV93AI", "B00005JNQS", "B000H7JCK0", "B0072GOJ48", "B006W4KRRY", "B002WJI2QQ", "B0012EM5D8", "B002D755B2", "B0006JMLRK", "B0000640SC", "B004ZQJ5FQ", "B001DPHDCY", "0783231474", "6305161887", "B000MV9026", "B0034G4P26", "B001ECQ75A", "B0045I3EQA", "B000BITUVG", "B005FNLUFQ", "B000ION23A", "B007Z2DO0E", "B003XEKXWK", "B004HO6I4M", "B001GCUO7A", "B003TJM60G", "B000AY74OG", "B003E66Y84", "B00000JL8E", "B00005JMQZ", "B00009M9BK", "B000DWMYQ8", "B00003CXG7", "B0000AK7AB", "B00029LO0Y", "B0001906W2", "B0006UEVT0", "B00CWM58WY", "B000RMJ4F8", "B002ZG97YM", "B0019BI11E", "B0052MXJ3Q", "B0034G4P1W", "B000MNOX9E", "B004EPZ034", "B00DBVHHDS", "B00I6JOD2S", "B005LAIHW2", "B000IFRT2O", "B005F96UJ6", "1782760326", "B0039N74CW", "B0045ZAQS2", "B000BB1MI2", "B000UVKGPI", "B0030ZIZRC", "B000C3L27U", "B001PR0YEE", "B003UAKE9Y", "B005SDUV4E", "B001HN6918", "B003RHZ6IE", "B001FTIJS0", "B0013FSL3E", "B00CO9N6CY", "B000VBJEEG", "B00009YXAW", "B0015XWUAY", "B00AEFYXD6", "B00007LVCM", "B0034GK74G", "B0042U94UQ", "B00CHVJODE", "B00008G8LM", "B00A8KJK7G", "B000G75AZC", "B00005JN4W", "B000ROAK2W", "B005LAII62", "B00E00OGE2", "B007J3ISKK", "6305123454"], "bought_together": ["B00003CXJ4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0044RFTBA", "B002DPVI0Q", "B00I0VTOMG", "B001LXIDTA"]}, "price": 5.0, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 5628}, "asin": "B000CZ0PT4", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61MzjQMqG%2BL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Wallace &amp; Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit (Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "John Carpenter's installment in theMasters of Horrorcable-TV anthology series looks at the ominous, underground mystique surrounding a notorious 1970s horror classic (now there's something Carpenter should know about).Cigarette Burnstracks the search for said opus,Le Fin Absolue du Monde, by the owner of a repertory theater (Norman Reedus) on behalf of a highly decadent millionaire collector (a role made for Udo Kier). The film, supposedly destroyed after it caused a riot at its only screening, causes viewers to turn into homicidal, cannibalistic maniacs. Even as Reedus gets on the trail of the lone existing print--listening to an interview with the director, looking at production stills--he begins to fall under its supernatural sway. Alas, the same can't be said forCigarette Burnsitself; the stuff about horror aficionados is good, but the production is slapdash, the dialogue stiff, and Reedus's performance incompetent. The basic idea, while a little film-schoolish, has some intrigue, and the notion of a film critic (supposedly a follower of Pauline Kael, no less) driven to write millions of words about this one barely-seen movie is amusingly sinister.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0041LULM6", "B00000JNBX", "B00004YA67", "B0029EW7BA", "B0001GH6ZK", "B0007GP7I2", "B001BEJ4J2", "B00006HAXZ", "B0020H45B6", "B009P25UWW", "B00E0FVZAK", "B00020VZTS", "B004G8WS66", "B00003CY1G", "B00GNZM0D6", "B000A2X49M", "0784014213", "B00D3LA63Y", "B0013D8LMC", "B002QW7ALM", "B000QFCDCW", "B002UNMW7O", "B00005JRMX", "B00G3DDGGI", "B004XVMCN0", "B00005JKWJ", "B000IY04Q8", "B00E0FVZZA", "B000FS2W3A", "B000LPS47K", "B000GI3RHY", "B000UR9QXK", "B000E5KUMO", "B000Q66QG0", "B000KJTFBG", "B000RIWAV2", "B002YKD77C", "B00000JGDA", "B0000DD75T", "B004LWZVZC", "B00FJIQX40", "B00CIH1JJ4", "B000PWQP9I", "B000CEXF5Q", "B00CDV4PPK", "B002UNMWAG", "B0000AOX0A", "B005SQRYB4", "1486463789", "B00DERIV8Y", "B00KDU8HQQ", "B00FBR8130", "B000RL21OK", "B000FA57W6", "B0009OUBC4", "B000BBOUW2", "B00EALTVPA", "B00FN5Z8UY", "B00BWYFTNG", "B000S1MMCU", "B00HFKUA76", "B000NY0YJA", "B001MEJY8W", "B0024FADBA", "1578482917", "B001AQT130", "B000WC38FU", "B000GB5M2O", "B000N8UXU6", "B000TUDBFC", "B000GB5M2Y", "B00GUK7APW", "B00GWLHX6A", "B000F3UACK", "B004LS6CN6", "B000OYCMO4", "B002QW7AJY", "B0000507QG", "B00D9EJGAY", "B00382S9MS", "078062856X", "B00005QAOZ", "B00EJX5CO8", "B002665I8K", "B00AJXO4FA", "B00JJOY496", "B002FICQFM", "B00GH1G4XI", "B00GKFKIOW", "B009NH6AOQ", "B000UNYK44", "B00006AUIG", "B00000K3TO", "B00DBNLAZW", "B0053TWV46", "B000KJTFB6", "B0014VPFVS", "B00AEFYDM2", "B005LAJ22Q", "B000RL21PO"], "bought_together": ["B0041LULM6", "B00000JNBX"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0029EW7BA", "B00004YA67", "B00E0FVZAK", "B00000JNBX"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 110354}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 8.41, "brand": "STARZ/SPHE", "asin": "B000E5KUME", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/513B65RJXYL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Masters of Horror - John Carpenter - Cigarette Burns"}

{"description": "Written, composed, and directed by Indian master Satyajit Ray (Pather Panchali),The Chess Playerspresents a stylized world in which the landed gentry lounge about, endlessly pulling on hookahs and engaging in the \"king of games.\" Outside their gilded doors, the order that allows them this luxury--let alone their marriages--is crumbling. They couldn't be more oblivious. As the narrator notes, \"Mr. Meer and Mr. Mirza are only playing at warfare. Their armies are pieces of ivory. Their battlefield: a piece of cloth.\" Set in 1856 Lucknow, the noblemen (Saeed Jaffrey and Sanjeev Kumar) are situated in one of the few Indian territories not ruled by Britain's East India Company. The British, meanwhile, are also playing a game of chess, and equally oblivious Oudh ruler Nawab Wajid Ali Shah (Amjad Khan) is the king they intend to capture. Forthright General Outram (Sir Richard Attenborough,Ghandi), assisted by the more culturally erudite Captain Weston (Tom Alter), is the man charged with the task. It shouldn&#x92;t be difficult: Like Meer and Mirza, Wajid would prefer to relax--to write poetry, to fly kites--rather than to rule. Along the way, Oudh will fall, but the chess will continue. Based on a story by Munshi Premchand,The Chess Playerswas Ray&#x92;s most elaborate production. It was also his first in Hindi (with English) and its frames are filled with music, dance, opulent pageantry, and humorous banter--even a lively animated sequence. Behind the attractive fa&#xE7;ade, however, lies a lament for lost opportunities.--Kathleen C.

{"description": "Series creator Genndy Tartakovsky has said, \"The third season is always the toughest in television production,\" but episodes 27 through 39 ofSamurai Jackshow no signs of flagging imagination. To the contrary, the Season 3 collection includes some of Jack's best adventures. In the outrageous episode 28, Aku turns teenagers into destructive zombies with rock music. Incongruously clad in hip-hop threads, Jack crashes a rave and defeats the sinister DJ in a wonderfully anachronistic mixture of break-dancing and martial artskata. Tartakovsky and his artists won a well-deserved Emmy for the two-part \"Birth of Evil,\" that traces the origins of Aku to a primordial, destructive cloud that Odin, Rama, and Ra destroyed. The same gods forged Jack's enchanted sword from human righteousness. The more dramatic stories are balanced against sillier tales: in episode 27, Jack gets turned into a chicken by an irritable wizard, and in episode 33, he has to deal with giant blue teddy bear-like creature, who has an unexpectedly nasty side.The extras include storyboard artist/martial artist Brian Andrews explaining how the crew stylized Chinese Whu Shu and Wing Chun techniques for Jack's combat moves, a gallery of preliminary sketches, and a commentary on \"Birth of Evil.\" It all adds up to a winning package.

Marrying Chloe (Emily Mortimer) will bring him a life of wealth and success, but his true passion lies with his brother-in-law's fiancee, the stunningly sensuous but unpredictable Nola (Scarlett Johansson). Pulsing with tension, Match Point rides the dangerous line between ambition and obsession to an ending as surprising as it is chilling.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000IU37SO", "B001DJ7PR8", "B003UESJCY", "B0013D8LC2", "B000AM6P2U", "B00005AUJK", "B00005JMON", "B000062XE6", "B005MYEQ4U", "B00A1O0G3G", "B002LMV7RA", "B000RIWAVC", "B005TTEFZ8", "0767819764", "6305291470", "B00008L3SA", "B00AEFYVUQ", "B001KEHAEE", "B00008978N", "B00005O06J", "6305327068", "B00004STRD", "6305428085", "B00005JL81", "B002ZG97O2", "0792846109", "0792846087", "B004U7MR4G", "B00005UW73", "B001539HQY", "6304907729", "076782153X", "B00000JGOI", "B00C7T0EPS", "B00003CY6A", "B00G7QPXUI", "B00005O06L", "B00080ZHD2", "B00005AUJI", "B00133KFGW", "B00013D580", "B00005O06N", "B001G9F9IW", "B005M2AKJW", "B00020X88E", "B0006A9FIM", "B00003CXGS", "B000GIXLXE", "0780622243", "B000FO0AD8", "B000K2UVZM", "B00005O06M", "B000F3UAFC", "B00005AUJH", "B00BTYXNPK", "B00005O06I", "B0064NTZKI", "0792846125", "B000255LIY", "B00005O06K", "B0007VZ9D0", "0792846117", "B00020VZTS", "B00005AUJM", "B00A1O0G5E", "B006FSRSTC", "B000VKL6T8", "B00GTZWVXE", "B000KWZ7JC", "B00005JMJ4", "B0007Q6VY6", "B0001US61O", "B00E1HIXEI", "B002VECLVO", "B004499LX0", "B00FRILRW0", "B007NYZA0Q", "B0006FO8E8", "B000N3SU92", "B0016Q2D66", "B00005AUJE", "B007ZIUP14", "B00AEFYCW8", "B0041KKYEM", "B00003CXZ4", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B001CC7PLM", "B002Q3MZXE", "B00K0MM4AM", "B004QI14KW", "B001CIOCJ4", "B00GPPXNIK", "B009UTX4M8", "B0017APPSE", "B001PPLJIQ", "B00GMV8M2Y", "B00G7QPYX4", "B00BSN0VZW", "B00384TDZ8", "B00005AUJO"], "bought_together": ["B001DJ7PR8", "B000IU37SO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005MYEQ4U", "B001DJ7PR8", "B0006A9FIM", "B00JJ3EHCG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 8735}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.52, "brand": "Dreamworks Skg", "asin": "B000EQHXNW", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4102J5QS38L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Match Point"}

In a single instant, her life changes when one of those plans--THRESHOLD--is activated by Deputy National Security Advisor J.T. Baylock (Charles S. Dutton).

{"description": "Surfacelasted one season on NBC before cancellation, butSurface: The Complete Serieson DVD will keep the show's exciting, Spielbergian suspense around for a long while. The primetime drama, involving several characters--in different parts of the world--all having similar brushes with fantastic creatures, instantly draws comparisons to Spielberg'sClose Encounters of the Third Kind. Add a government conspiracy (complete with a cover story to force one community's evacuation) to prevent the public from learning of the existence of a previously unknown life form, and the parallels withClose Encountersgrow thick. But it's not a problem: the many twists and turns inSurface's far-ranging storyline, and the nature of the species that slowly becomes a factor in the survival of the human race, are compelling on their own terms.Created by twin brothers and television writers-producers-directors Josh and Jonas Pate (L.A. Dragnet),Surfacestars rangy beauty Lake Bell as oceanographer and single mom Dr. Laura \"Dee\" Daughtery. While doing some research in a submersible at the bottom of the sea, Dee discovers a seemingly bottomless pit leading to astonishing depths in the Earth. But she also bumps into a sea monster that emanates electrical charges strong enough to wreak havoc with her vessel. Meanwhile, a Louisiana-based insurance salesman, Rich (Jay R. Ferguson), is traumatized when he sees his brother dragged away by a similar creature, and a 14-year-old boy, Miles (Carter Jenkins), raises one of the beasts after it hatches from an egg. Throughout all this, a scientist (Rade Sherbedgia) and a heavy-handed national security agent (Ian Anthony Dale) are trying to unlock the mystery of the species, which appears to be growing in number at the same time strange forces are affecting the oceans. Naturally, there's a story behind the story--government and corporate shenanigans and all that. That stuff gets a little tedious and, truth be told, a couple of the show's protagonists are among the most unlikable people seen in series television in a long while. But despite its premature end after a mere 15 episodes,Surfacefinally offers an original, unsettling, and even surreal vision of the world going through apocalyptic transformations. The final image of the final show lingers in the imagination a long time.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000FOPPBA", "B0051GOB2G", "B000E5N6B6", "B000FIHN8O", "B003PGNBO8", "B000N3T0EG", "B0037AGB9O", "B001QE99BA", "B000EOTV98", "B0002S94BQ", "B001CQONMC", "B000FS9MY2", "B000ELL1QC", "B002DQSKME", "B001RXDM2M", "B000JLTRHW", "B004XM38CS", "B002TQKL7A", "B003LXM1PK", "B0009JE6G6", "B000MMMTD2", "B00465I156", "B001715A92", "B00BHLTIXQ", "B002U0KHME", "B001RHGRTS", "B001A7GOCA", "B00005JM39", "B003R0MEYA", "B0081QF6Q8", "B00061QJSK", "B00B04NIZO", "B0012IX35S", "B00404ME2E", "B000BCCAEQ", "B00F3L8P26", "B007G4X7VC", "B002QU1Z1K", "B00170LCWC", "B003LXM1B4", "B008B4KVRE", "B004LROMS4", "B0011FLH00", "B00IWTVDUW", "B00062IDEW", "B002USF1UO", "B0055SNHQG", "B000ERVJLS", "B00023BKMC", "B000MX7V66", "B0009JE6FM", "B000QUEQ4U", "B000FUTVPA", "B0056GLNQI", "B008I34YOO", "B000SMNL92", "B00HUPC5X8", "B00BN0WQ5I", "B00JF5GAZA", "B00CRX82LM", "B00KHA9BQ2", "B004YPED14", "B0012Z36F8", "B002BWP2IK", "B000067FP2", "B000WTZ6SK", "B003H9LIU2", "B004LROMWU", "B0000V4910", "B00ECXJC28", "B0006UEVUE", "B00B4804LM", "B001C4CI8U", "B00005B8UD", "B0007CEXUY", "B0038MUZ3E", "B003L77GWE", "B009AMAJBO", "B0007OCG5Q", "B00133QNSG", "B001CY5N00", "B000E8JO2S", "B005PPMHO2", "B002JVWRD6", "B002QZDSW4", "B00KTZALDC", "B004X60QE2", "B000ATQYXI", "B0009A407A", "B0017IVHHO", "B000SQFC2C", "B002C3GTLC", "B000BR9SA0", "B0012IXBNC", "B000A9QKT6", "B0032JTUX4", "B000BOH8Y6", "B00H57HOSC", "B0030VANIU", "B00B5ARKC0"], "bought_together": ["B000FOPPBA", "B0051GOB2G"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000N3T0EG", "B000FOPPBA", "B000E5N6B6", "B0051GOB2G"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 25662}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 12.39, "brand": "Universal Studios", "asin": "B000FJH5M2", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51D2Q9RFRVL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Surface: The Complete Series"}

{"description": "The cover art for HBO's comedyCurb Your Enthusiasm: The Complete Fifth Seasonimplies that the series' star Larry David is Everyman. Larry is not Everyman; in fact, he is far from it. Somewhat of an amalgam of the Jerry, George, Elaine, and Kramer characters he co-created forSeinfeld, yet so uniquely Larry, his socially inept behavior is the basis for and the best part of the show. This fifth season holds no exceptions to the world oblivious to social graces that is Larry David's. Larry tackles some tough issues, his main conundrum being the fact that his close friend Richard Lewis (comedian Richard Lewis playing himself) needs a new kidney. Season 5 slants towards Larry's soul searching: will he take the donor test? Is he a match? What will he do if he is a match? We see how far Larry will go to help his friend in need: staging car accidents, fake marriages, and more. We think we see some depth to Larry when he suspects he may be adopted and cheerfully embarks on a search to find his \"real\" parents, but are reminded how things really are, when he throws morality out the window, striking up a friendship with the known sexual predator in the neighborhood in order to improve his golf game. Of course there is the verySeinfeldfeel to this show in general, the tone, the self-involved lead character--and in the first few episodes there are actual storylines and even spoken lines taken almost verbatim fromSeinfeldepisodes, so much so that an avidSeinfeldfan may start to lose patience.  Stick with it, though, because theSeinfeld-ian similarities wind down through the second half of the season and theCurb your Enthusiasmhilarity revs up.--Rachel Moss", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0009WIE34", "B000VXK6Z0", "B00067BCB8", "B002OOWKSA", "B0001US8EE", "B003L77GMO", "B0000E2PVR", "B002LMV7RA", "B00EHJC7I8", "B00G4RIOOW", "B008LCRA98", "B008LCRABQ", "B008LCRA7K", "B00AS86VFM", "B00G4RIPE6", "B008LCRAC0", "B005S97V82", "B0002UE1WQ", "0792842162", "B002OID4WM", "B00005JLEX", "B007WGDCPU", "B00BUUAV08", "B002N5N5SO", "B004B9JIYU", "B0089BSNVK", "B00EEDNR9A", "B0002WZTLQ", "B00065GX64", "B008LCRAFC", "B000RZIGYA", "B0018RKEQE", "B009LDD4BO", "B00FOHHMWI", "B000EXDS7K", "6304498969", "B0007YXRCW", "B0019CLMW8", "B009LDD40U", "B000BO7DWI", "B00BGI07XU", "B0000E2FLB", "B00003CXOP", "B00005NOHO", "B007KFZ88M", "B00BI7ZAM2", "B0060MYKYY", "B009LA4MUE", "B00EIJTLK4", "B00HUCF420", "B0001MZ7K0", "B004HW7JH4", "B000RO6JZY", "B0001NBNIY", "B003L77GDS", "B005LAJ1H2", "B00008NV4G", "B000CQLZ0Q", "B000F5GNX8", "B0010X8NF0", "B00AB65SVE", "B0000640VJ", "B001EIOOV8", "6305999872", "B00FR81Z40", "B005E7SEOI", "B000M5AJQI", "B005LAII12", "B0058YPPN0", "B007STBUIW"], "bought_together": ["B0009WIE34", "B000VXK6Z0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000VXK6Z0", "B003L77GMO", "B002OOWKSA", "B0009WIE34"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 29365}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 20.99, "brand": "HBO", "asin": "B000FL7CAU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51APEAY4F0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Curb Your Enthusiasm: Season 5"}
{"description": "In addition to spawning the popularNaked Gunmovie franchise,Police Squad!had a lasting impact on TV comedy, and it's still a guilty pleasure. Hot from the success ofAirplane!two years earlier, the ZAZ team (brothers David and Jerry Zucker and writing partner Jim Abrahams) decided to spoof TV cop shows, using the late '50s Lee Marvin seriesM Squadand the popular series format of Quinn Martin Productions (e.g.,The Streets of San Francisco) as their template for supremely silly, gag-laden satire. WithAirplane!star Leslie Nielsen as straight-faced detective Frank Drebin and Alan North as Drebin's befuddled boss, Capt. Ed Hocken, this half-hour series quickly established an irresistible combination of nonstop sight gags, non sequiturs, and repeated routines (\"Cigarette?\" \"Yes, it is\") that dared viewers to pay close attention or miss the laughs if they didn't. Ironically, this very quality--you had to actuallywatchthe show instead of casually listening for punchlines--is what ultimately sealed the series' fate. After only six poorly rated episodes,Police Squad!was canceled without fanfare, and six years passed before Drebin returned as the bumbling hero ofThe Naked Gun.Will all six episodes on one DVD, ZAZ fans can get reacquainted with a series that was arguably ahead of its time. In addition to the rib-tickling disparity between onscreen episode titles and narrated titles, and \"special guest stars\" (including William Shatner, Robert Goulet, Lorne Greene, and others) who get killed in the opening credits, loyal viewers could count on a weekly dose of hilarity from Nielsen, North, and their supporting players. Character actor William Duell appeared each week as shoeshine boy \"Johnny the Snitch,\" capable of answering literallyanyquestion if you repeatedly greased his palm (a gag that led to info-seeking cameo appearances by Dick Clark, Dr. Joyce Brothers, baseball manager Tommy Lasorda, and others). And while originalMission: Impossiblecostar Peter Lupus poked fun at himself as the dim-witted Det. Norberg (later played by O.J. Simpson in theNaked Gunmovies), Ed Williams--an actual high school science teacher--is hilarious as \"Mr. Wizard\"-like lab technician Ted Olson, who dispenses dubious science lessons to unsuspecting children. The fast-paced barrage of humor guaranteed that every episode would deliver as many hits as misses, and while some of the jokes have lost their punch,Police Squad!still delivers the belly-laughs... and always will, as long as humans have an appetite for shameless stupidity.--Jeff ShannonOn the DVDTwo episode commentaries by the Zucker brothers, Jim Abrahams, and producer Robert K. Weiss are good for a laugh, as the ZAZ team laughs at their own material and recalls the rigors of a 5-day shooting schedule, battles with network censors (also outlined in the revealing \"Production Memo Highlights\" feature), and the never-shown \"celebrity guest death\" of John Belushi, who actually died shortly after the gag was filmed. Comedian and writer Robert Wuhl's commentary is more autobiographical and somewhat perfunctory (he barely remembers the episode he wrote), but contains a few nuts-and-bolts details about the show's production. The 10-minute Leslie Nielsen interview shows the gracefully aging star in fine form as he recalls his affinity for the ZAZ brand of humor; the brief gag reel offers about a dozen on-set bloopers (several from crude workprint sources); \"Behind the Freeze Frames\" is an extended outtake to illustrate the elaborately faked \"freeze frame\" gag that ended each episode; and \"Celebrity Death Shots\" is a list of guest-star death gags proposed (and mostly used) for the series. Also included are casting tests for Alan North and Ed Williams, and an animated producers' photo gallery ofPolice Squad!sets, props, and scenery.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AJCUL1C", "B00AMSQBUI", "6305428263", "B00AMSQBRQ", "B005NKIPUO", "B001Q8MMC4", "B0001ZX0O2", "B00005V5NQ", "B000K405CY", "B0006FO578", "B00BTYFWEA", "B00AEFXDAK", "1558908412", "6305268797", "B00LT1JHLW", "B002GOAGYI", "B00AEFXDO6", "B002GSXKPG", "0792166523", "B0000A02TY", "B002GSXKOC", "079073849X", "B00AEFYP3E", "B00LNBQ8SI", "6305840083", "B00LNBQ8UG", "B00AEFYPAC", "B000A6T1KY", "B000F7CMPE", "B00L326LTI", "B00008EY6Q", "0792166493", "B00L9K2EGS", "B0001Z4OXS", "B000PHX5MI", "B000065U1D", "B001666484", "0792844890", "B00441GYQ0", "B000G6BLW4", "B00008972V", "B001E0O8DA", "B0019HQICW", "B001J710YI", "B000G6BLWE", "B000BMY2LU", "B001HUHBBS", "B00C7A8WMO", "B0016MJ6J2", "B006JN87CU", "B00005O06W", "B000FO0AFQ", "B00GT83J1E", "B00E3QJ83C", "B00KSPST6Y", "B006TTC5GS", "B000VUQ4HM", "B00003CXGS", "6549303141", "6304493681", "B00005O3VC", "B000VE439Y", "B000AQ69QS", "B000WC38FA", "B000G6BLGK", "B000O76ZOO", "B00AEFXDGE", "B00319ECGU", "B0010YVCAM", "0783230346", "B00000K3U4", "B000EOOVMA", "B00ECXJBNS", "B003NTUOGU", "B0001S6AQE", "B00J5LXTUI", "B0003JANSW", "B00005JKHX", "B00AO686MY", "0783232063", "B00EALTX8A", "B000RJO564", "B0008JIJ2O", "B007LNBS2I", "B00F77MAO0", "B0053O8A78", "B0017XOF50", "B0000399WD", "B0000DC13R", "B00441GZ2S", "B003H9LIU2", "B00103584Y", "0062069306", "B002DH20Q0", "B00AEBB9U0", "B00K7IPGS6", "B009SQ9Q5M", "B001S86IZE", "B008L0YN18", "B000G6BLRE"], "bought_together": ["B00AMSQBUI", "B00AMSQBRQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AMSQBUI", "B00AJCUL1C", "B00AMSQBRQ", "B0001ZX0O2"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 14064}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 24.36, "brand": "Paramount Home Video", "asin": "B000H7JCFK", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51XCN00YqCL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Police Squad!

{"description": "You probably don't think you need to see another remake ofLassie, but you do. Charles Sturridge's (Brideshead Revisited) film was criminally neglected in theaters but should gain a lofty status on home video as did remakes ofThe Secret Garden,A Little Princessand Sturridge's ownFairyTale: A True Story. It's a simple story of a dog who loves a boy so much she'll cross a country to reunite with him. Yes, you might need your handkerchief. No, not that much. Mom Sarah (Samantha Morton), dad Sam (John Lynch) and their son Joe (an adorable Jonathan Mason) live in an English coal town shortly before the Second World War. To put food on the table, Lassie is sold to The Duke of Rudling (Peter O'Toole, in fine form) for his granddaughter, Cilla (Hester Odgers). Soon the Duke and Lassie retire to Scotland, some 500 miles away, but neither distance, status, an angry kennel man, nor bumbling dog catchers will keep Lassie from Joe. Along the roads and hills of England (with Ireland scenery subbing in), Lassie touches many folks including a lovelorn lady (Kelly MacDonald), a scientist (Edward Fox), and most notably, a traveling performer (Peter Dinklage). Sturridge's deft touch allows the film to breathe with a great sense of physical comedy for the kids that never descends into pure shenanigans. There is just enough heart-tugging to go along with the scenic adventure. The cast is uniformly strong, with fine work from O'Toole, Morton, and Dinklage. Throw in beautiful scenery, cute dogs, Adrian Johnson's dramatic score, a cameo from the Loch Ness monster(!), and you have a winner; our pick for the best family film on DVD in 2006.

{"description": "Gabriel Byre gives a fantastic performance as a 1960's British diplomat in Africa tormented by love, caring for his son and alcohol. Emily Watson pulls out all the stops as his second wife, a fiesty American who breaks tradition at every turn and attempts to bring her step-son out of his introverted shell. She refers to the upper-crust Brit-slang of 'toodle-pip' and 'hobbly-jobbly' as 'Wah Wah', the verbal equivalent of an eye roll. What is so great about this movie is the quality of the cast and the chemistry between them. Intense dynamics exist between the father's alcoholism and his family's attempts to accept it, then cure him of it. Nicholas Hoult, ofAbout A Boy, is the son who struggles with loyalties between his mother, father and step-mother. A wonderful directorial debut by actor Richard E. Grant, making relatable the story of a family that is anything but average, by drawing on the emotion and empathy that's in us all.--Rachel MossProduct DescriptionAcclaimed actor Richard E. Grant'sWah-Wahis a semi-autobiographical 'coming-of-age at the end of an age' story, told through the eyes of young Ralph Compton. Set during the last gasp of the British Empire in Swaziland, South East Africa, in 1969, the plot focuses on the dysfunctional Compton family whose gradual disintegration mirrors the end of British rule.As an 11-year-old, Ralph witnesses his mother's adultery with his father's best friend. His parents divorce and Ralph is sent to boarding school. His father, Harry (Gabriel Byrne), not only loses his wife (Miranda Richardson) and best friend, but also his position as Minister of Education with the coming of Independence, prompting his rapid descent into alcoholism.Now 14, Ralph (Nicholas Hoult) returns home to discover that his father has re-married an American ex-air 'hostess' named Ruby whom his father has known all of six weeks. As round a peg as you could find in this square holed society, Ruby (Emily Watson) ridicules the petty snobbery of the restless colonials whose chief amusements are gin, adultery, and their foppish slang of 'toodle-pip' and 'hobbly-jobbly' ' that Ruby identifies as sounding like Wah-Wah.Although Ralph is initially wary of Ruby, he bonds with her as his father's drinking escalates and becomes dangerously out of control. It's this chaos that stokes Ralph's inner turmoil, and eventually forges his creative mind.More Stills fromWah-Wah(click for larger image)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002VECLVO", "B000TGJ81M", "B00005JL7Q", "B000CSUNQQ", "0330441973", "B001G1FL42", "B0017VG604", "B001P7YD82", "B008220BLG", "B004ALIG4M", "B00CFA222M", "B000VE4UHO", "B00G3DA5XA", "B004A8ZWV0", "B00GHP8SH4", "B005CFC0HE", "B00DNUSFZQ", "B0019OP0GU", "B008WAM2FQ", "B008220BP2", "B0009P7EI2", "B00000F4MA", "B00067BBMS", "1570981523", "B000ETRCN0", "B002ZG977Y", "B004SIP7D0", "0792839137", "B001NPD9JA", "B008220C38", "0767802519", "6305835594", "B005S9EJ14", "0985628413", "B001AR4K62", "B00009RA3B", "B00005V9I8", "B00079HZPC", "1570980462"], "bought_together": ["B002VECLVO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005JL7Q", "B008220BLG", "0879519355", "B000TGJ81M"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 222065}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.98, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B000IFRT5Q", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ov09dUrYL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Wah:Wah"}

After the twins are born (two-part episode \"Happy Birthday, Babies\"), the Tanner household expands to nine--10 if you count D.J.'s best buddy, Kimmy (Andrea Barber), who practically lives in the spacious townhouse--11 if you count family pooch Comet.There are other firsts. In \"Easy Rider,\" Michelle learns to ride a bike and in \"Driving Miss D.J.,\" D.J. gets her learner's permit. In one respect, year five represents a return to the show's roots as the ad agency is no more. Jesse is fronting a band again, while Joey (Dave Coulier) has returned to stand-up, a development that leads to a dream gig in \"The Legend of Ranger Joe.\" Other episodes of interest include \"Gotta Dance,\" in which Danny imagines Stephanie on Broadway (the whole family sings and dances along), and \"Play It Again, Jesse,\" in which Danny's new relationship resembles a certain classic film with Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman. Guest stars include June Lockhart (\"Matchmaker Michelle\"), Whitman Mayo (\"The Volunteer\"), and Mike Love and Bruce Johnston from the Beach Boys (season finale \"Captain Video\"). With Barber now a regular, the new recurring character is Michelle's pal, Teddy (Tahj Mowry, future star of the WB comedySmart Guy).--Kathleen C.

{"description": "First screened in Europe and scheduled for limited release in the U.S.,The Illusionistoffers welcome proof that \"arthouse\" quality needn't be limited to the arthouses. Set in turn-of-the-century Vienna, this stately, elegant period film benefited from a crossover release in mainstream cinemas, and showed considerable box-office staying power--granted, teenage mallrats and lusty males may have been drawn to the allure ofSeventh Heavenalumna Jessica Biel, who rises to the occasion with a fine performance. But there's equal appeal in the casting of Edward Norton and Paul Giamatti, who bring their formidable talents to bear on the intriguing tale of a celebrated magician named Eisenheim (Norton) whose stage performance offends the Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell), a vindictive lout who aims to marry Duchess Sophie (Biel), Eisenheim's childhood friend and now, 15 years later, his would-be lover. This romantic rivalry and Eisenheim's increasingly enigmatic craft of illusion are investigated by Chief Inspector Uhl (Giamatti), who's under Leopold's command and is therefore not to be trusted as Eisenheim and Sophie draw closer to their inevitable reunion. Cleverly adapted by director Neil Burger from Steven Millhauser's short story \"Eisenheim the Illusionist,\" and boasting exquisite production values and a fine score by Philip Glass,The Illusionistis the kind of class act that fully deserved its unusually wide and appreciative audience. --Jeff ShannonBeyondThe Illusionist\"Eisenheim the Illusionist\" and Other StoriesPaul Giamatti in a More Loveable RoleMagic Kits & AccessoriesStills fromThe Illusionist", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000LC55F2", "B000NOIX48", "B002ZG980U", "B002WNU0QW", "B00DWZHTOU", "B001MZ5W3M", "B00011CZRE", "B000H0MKI8", "B00008K7AO", "B000L212HC", "B00AEBB8NI", "B000GFLKF8", "B000O76ZO4", "B00003CXZ4", "B00005JLSB", "B000FKO5QK", "B000M341QE", "B00AEFXGIY", "B00005V9HH", "B00AEBB8LA", "B00005JMOW", "B00096S49Y", "0767847415", "6305313687", "B004SIP9Z6", "B0047T74CM", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B000R4SMCW", "B0002YLCG0", "B000P0J0EW", "B000HEWEE4", "B0041KKYHE", "B00BBI7EZY", "B00AEBBA2W", "B000CQLZ0Q", "0783235070", "0767802519", "B002ZG997C", "B00003CXHG", "B004SIP7ZS", "B000069HZP", "B004SIP7PS", "B003ASLJQI", "B00177Y9ZC", "B00005JLKN", "B003ZW9H68", "B001N44BVQ", "B002O3Z50Q", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00005JN2Z", "B00AEBB86A", "B00000F4ZY", "B000MZHW40", "0671686402", "B00BB67UNW", "B005HP2J0M", "B000QXDED6", "B000NIVJF4", "B001F12J0C", "B000N6TX1I", "B000LAZE8C", "B00080ZG10", "B005LAIGRS", "B0009MDPYM", "0792159659", "B000OYC7BW", "B001UV4XGU", "B004AOECXI", "0767818105", "B000XR9L50", "B0018O4YT0", "B00015YVDG", "B004SIP8JI", "B00004XPPG", "B00006ZXSK", "B001DHXT20", "B0000AC8LR", "B009B8YMB0", "0783229402", "B0006210ZG", "B001PPGAIA", "B00004BZIY", "B008JFURII", "B00005JPAR", "B00006ADFM", "B004SIP7TE", "B000F5GNX8", "B000FS9FCG", "B006P0FIGU", "B00005JMCN", "B002VWNID6", "B004XQO90O", "B004EPZ084", "B00AEBB9M8", "B000P5FH3K", "B00005JNY3", "B000063US3", "B003L20IG0"], "bought_together": ["B000LC55F2", "B002ZG980U"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000LC55F2", "B005LAIHXQ", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00DV2MVWO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 60145}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.0, "brand": "Twentieth Century Fox", "asin": "B000K7VHPU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51nYghoS63L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Illusionist (Full Screen Edition)"}

{"description": "The violent five-part adventureAfro Samuraimarks both the increasing confluence of American and Japanese pop culture and the shift in Japanese depictions of African-Americans. The popularity of hip-hop in Japan has led to more positive images of blacks, including Takashi Okazaki's original manga. The \"Director's Cut\" contains an additional 15 minutes of footage, and is even gorier than the broadcast version on Spike TV. As a boy, Afro Samurai saw his father beheaded by the maniacal Justice. The murderer sought an ancient headband that marks the wearer as the #1 warrior in the world. As an adult, Afro seeks only revenge, cutting down anyone who blocks his path to Justice.Afro Samuraidepicts a oddly anachronistic world that infuses cell phones, cigarette lighters, and cyber technology into traditional Japanese culture. The elongated character designs recall Peter Chung'sAeon Flux, and much of the series is rendered in moody grays, accented by gobbets of scarlet blood. Afro is such a taciturn figure, most of the dialogue goes to his motor-mouth comrade Ninja Ninja. This big budget production features an eclectic score by Wu-Tang Clan co-founder RZA and an A-list vocal cast that includes Samuel L. Jackson and Ron Perlman. But for all its elaborate production values and over-the-top fights,Afro Samuraisuffers from a weakness at its core: Afro is so monosyllabic and cold-blooded, he's not very interesting. His inevitable duel-to-the-death with Justice lacks the emotional punch of Spike's face-off against Vicious inCowboy Bebopor Kenshin's one-on-one with Shishio inRurouni Kenshin.

{"description": "Christopher Guest (director ofA Mighty Wind,Best in Show, andWaiting for Guffman) and his sparkling troupe of improvisational satirists return with a sardonic look at C-list (or perhaps D- or E-list) actors driven to the brink of madness by the possibility of winning an Academy Award. Marilyn Hack (the ever-brilliant Catherine O'Hara,Beetlejuice), a modestly talented character actress, hears of an Internet rumor that she might be nominated for the dubious movie she's currently making,Home for Purim. Soon buzz is flying about all the rest of the cast (which includes Harry Shearer and Parker Posey) and everyone starts clawing for as much attention as they can get while appearing modest and unambitious. Despite the movie's target being so familiar to them,For Your Considerationis not Guest & Co.'s best work--in an effort to give everyone in the huge cast face time, few of the characters gain any comic traction or have a particularly engaging storyline; the mockery stays on a fairly surface level.  Nonetheless, some of those surfaces are pretty funny: Fred Willard and Jane Lynch are devastating as a pair of predatory infotainment hosts, while Jennifer Coolidge (Legally Blonde) turns in a daffy and surreal performance. Throughout, the movie's anchor is O'Hara; the way her character is virtually crushed by the hype has a surprising richness and depth. She remains a cinematic treasure.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000ALFVD", "B00005LC5D", "B00005ALS0", "6305922756", "B00006HAWL", "B009VY00OC", "B000M341SC", "B00DQEHKZ0", "B000Y5JFN4", "B002HMHSJ0", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B007PXYWBI", "B0045O2PHS", "B001JIE7JC", "B00G7QPXUI", "079073155X", "B001IOQWA4", "B00J8JQ8YG", "B000NO1XG8", "B000055Z4G", "1557836094", "B007UW9W32", "B003102JDM", "B000K7VHQE", "B00008979F", "6305428239", "6305327068", "0780628306", "B00007AJF8", "B00005JLRE", "B002XUL6SA", "B00344EAN2", "B000055Z4H", "B0000640VJ", "B00000K3CS", "B0010X8NF0", "B004A8ZWV0", "B00013WVLC", "B00GNZLZLO", "B000G6BLWE", "B000OU082G", "0780618564", "B0006TPE4C", "B002PLPQLU", "B00004ZEU2", "B008CYDD7I", "B001LXIDUY", "B007L6VR12", "B00026ZEEE", "B00DL48BM6", "B000NIVJFY", "B0007UC8Y4", "B0007QJ1ES", "B001E95ZNS", "B0010DM3R4", "B00AADAEBW", "B00005JPE3", "B00008977D", "B00000JGHT", "0790742071", "B00009W5CA", "B00GPWEPZ8", "6305291470", "B00005JPX8", "B00AMEZDK6", "B00GMV8M2Y", "B00004STRF", "B008220C38", "B000059HA5", "B00DT55OPE", "B00B04NIWM", "B00005JLZW", "B000035Z3C", "B0001907AI", "B005LAIIJY", "B00H9L26AA", "B00AEFY9RG", "B00003CXC3", "B000FS9FD0", "B0000714BP", "B004SIP8ZM", "B000M4RG7E", "B00BTYSIXC", "B00AEFY5B6", "B000286RNE", "B0000VV4OK", "B00004RE27", "B00H7LJ2UO", "B001QFFBAM", "630589423X", "B001FB55KI", "B00GUO2SKA", "B00441GYRO", "B000063K2Q", "B00AEFXN9G", "B002IFUCYE", "B000P5FH5S", "B000LC55F2", "B000055Y0X", "B00007LTIA"], "bought_together": ["B0000ALFVD", "B00005ALS0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005ALS0", "B0000ALFVD", "6305922756", "B00005LC5D"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 29159}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.99, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B000M341Q4", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Zl7Ebbs5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "For Your Consideration (Widescreen)"}
{"description": "Infamousis inevitably compared toCapote, since it also chronicles author Truman Capote's spiral into chaos while composing his masterpiece,In Cold Blood, a breakthrough non-fictional tale told as fiction. It's a shame thatCapote'scritical acclaim eclipsed this film's, as Toby Jones is perfectly convincing as Capote, with his small stature and eccentric manner.Infamousmimics the novel's fictionalized non-fiction, opening on \"interviews\" with Capote's New York friends like Diana Vreeland (Juliet Stevenson) and Babe Paley (Sigourney Weaver). The film, set in 1959, begins with Capote's discovery of the farm family murder story and his trek out to Kansas with confidant, Nelle Harper Lee (Sandra Bullock). Stressing Capote's relationships with Lee, the film justifies Capote's marginal behavior by Lee's speaking about Capote's childhood neglect, which she also wrote intoTo Kill A Mockingbird. Capote's own description of his rough childhood then serves as a barrier breaker between himself and Perry Smith (Daniel Craig), the half of the Perry Smith-Dick Hickock killing team who is at first unwilling to talk.Infamousmakes much of the sexual tension between Capote and Smith, implying that Capote persevered through his project for Smith's love. Based on George Plimpton's oral biography,Infamousdeserves a stellar place in Capote-lore, as there is ample room for both competing films.--Trinie Dalton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000E33VWW", "B0000AN4JE", "6305736685", "6305874867", "B00465I16K", "B00068GTK6", "B00000JGHN", "B002O3Z4ZW", "B001N77YPS", "B00F3L8P4E", "B0000640RY", "0783235380", "B003TNVZR2", "B00067AVKQ", "B0077ATSSQ", "B000GB5M3S", "B000CEV3M8", "1439187509", "B0014GI6I2", "B002LVVCJY", "B000058TLQ", "B002SYAGNC", "B004SIP71M", "B000P23Q5O", "B00979KQ4U", "B00004UEDQ", "B00FQRZ6EM", "B008220DGE", "B00AQ5905U", "B00066FB2A", "B001UJUGZY", "B002NZK5RS", "0385491735", "B0013XZ2QK", "B0000JD29M", "0817317562", "B000G6BLJW", "B0002IQLHQ", "0679751823", "B003M785HS", "B000M341Q4", "B00AEBB8SS", "B002NZK5VO", "B00008G6E8", "B005FH1RRI", "B004TFTE8Q", "B004EC5ITI", "B00112S8RS", "B008XEZXDO", "0385232497", "B00AZESO72", "6304765266", "0375702415", "B000QGDY0G", "0671228110", "B00005BCK9", "B000ERVJQ8", "B0006GAO18", "B000KGGIVY", "0679745580", "B000087F7Q", "B000A3XY5A", "B0018M6J90", "B00H83EUQW", "B0009W5IMO", "B00AQBDU4Q", "B00H7LJ2UO", "B0000AYGBF", "B00GUO2SKA", "B00IJS2OHM", "B002NZK5V4", "B00008WI9N", "B0007R4TJ4", "B00G0I055Q", "B00E8RKHWW", "B000HEWEE4", "6305803765", "B00GPWEPZ8", "B00003CWTI", "B00G4Q3KOC", "B0045HCJGC", "B00008K7AO", "B0077ATSZE", "0394556453", "B0002TSZHO", "B000R4SMCW", "B003PIUIJC", "B008RO6PJQ", "B002DU39GW", "B000NOIX48", "B00D2CYU2W", "B00G15MDI0", "B002NXSRN4", "B000NO1XG8", "B002SYAGN2", "B00DW5IK9S", "B0001GOH7K", "B004M9QNXI", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B00AEFYYWQ"], "bought_together": ["B000E33VWW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000E33VWW", "B008220DGE", "B000CEV3M8", "B002NZK5VO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 20233}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.99, "brand": "JONES,TOBY", "asin": "B000M341SC", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515IbbE2cbL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Infamous"}
{"description": "Martin Scorsese makes a welcome return to the mean streets (of Boston, in this case) withThe Departed, hailed by many as Scorsese's best film sinceCasino. Since this crackling crime thriller is essentially a Scorsese-stamped remake of the acclaimed 2002 Hong Kong thrillerInfernal Affairs, the film was intensely scrutinized by devoted critics and cinephiles, and while Scorsese's intense filmmaking and all-star cast deserve ample acclaim,The Departedis also worthy of serious re-assessment, especially with regard to what some attentive viewers described as sloppy craftsmanship (!), notably in terms of mismatched shots and jagged continuity. But no matter where you fall on the Scorsese appreciation scale, there's no denying thatThe Departedis a signature piece of work from one of America's finest directors, designed for maximum impact with a breathtaking series of twists, turns, and violent surprises. It's an intricate cat-and-mouse game, but this time the cat and mouse are both moles: Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) is an ambitious cop on the rise, planted in the Boston police force by criminal kingpin Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a hot-tempered police cadet who's been artificially disgraced and then planted into Costello's crime operation as a seemingly trustworthy soldier. As the multilayered plot unfolds (courtesy of a scorching adaptation byKingdom of Heavenscreenwriter William Monahan), Costigan and Sullivan conduct a volatile search for each other (they're essentially looking for \"themselves\") while simultaneously wooing the psychiatrist (Vera Farmiga) assigned to treat their crime-driven anxieties.Such convenient coincidences might sink a lesser film, butThe Departedis so electrifying that you barely notice the plot-holes. And while Nicholson's profane swagger is too much \"Jack\" and not enough \"Costello,\" he's still a joy to watch, especially in a film that's additionally energized by memorable (and frequently hilarious) supporting roles for Alec Baldwin, Mark Wahlberg, and a host of other big-name performers.The Departedalso makes clever and plot-dependent use of cell-phones, to the extent that it couldn't exist without them. Powered by Scorsese's trademark use of well-chosen soundtrack songs (from vintage rock to Puccini's operas),The Departedmay not be perfect, but it's one helluva ride for moviegoers, proving popular enough to become the biggest box-office hit of Scorsese's commercially rocky career.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002ZG99N6", "B000P0J09M", "B004SIP7TE", "B004SIP8ZM", "B002ZG980U", "B002VWNIEA", "B00011CZRE", "B00AEBB8NI", "B002T9H2LA", "B00005JLSB", "B000MZHW40", "B00080ZG10", "B003ASLJQS", "B000P0J0AG", "B000P0J0EW", "B000C20VPA", "B003UESJHO", "B004SIP7ZS", "B003ASLJO0", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B002CPMB9O", "B00AHTYI5M", "B00275EGWY", "B000XR9L50", "B000A3XY5A", "B0007DFJ0G", "B001N44BVQ", "B00003CXWV", "B008MILL8W", "B000286RP2", "B004SIP7VM", "B00005V9HH", "6305313687", "B00AEBB9NM", "B004FQX5B6", "B00AEFXKUI", "B004SIP95G", "B00AEBB86A", "B005LAIIJY", "B0016Q2D66", "B003ASLJQI", "B00008975Z", "B000IY04Q8", "B001P9KR8U", "B00005JNJV", "B000C20VRS", "B008R65XYC", "B005LAIGRS", "B00H9KKGTO", "B00008DP4C", "B00AEBB9F0", "B00AEFY5B6", "B00005JN0W", "B005LAIGLE", "B000A2UBN4", "B002QEHPQU", "B000P0J0EM", "B003UESJH4", "B007D5E7C2", "6304765258", "B000P0J0D8", "B00AEFY0XE", "B00004WG2F", "0767830555", "B000LC55F2", "B002O3Z4Y8", "B004EPYZP8", "B000A7DVR2", "B00005JPD0", "B000WZEZGI", "B00049QQHI", "B000FS9FCG", "B00004XPPB", "B006OFN0SE", "B009AMAL4Y", "B004U7MR14", "B000GFLKF8", "B003AWRMCE", "B0019L770A", "B00BEIYN9Q", "B0000AM6JI", "B004SIP9Z6", "B001GZ6QC4", "0783240295", "B0010DR4BO", "B000065U1N", "B00001ZWUS", "B00BB67UNW", "B0000B1OFL", "B00AEBB9K0", "B00DHDDE32", "B00005JKWX", "B0051MKNV8", "B002ZG97RE", "0767802519", "B0034G4P94", "B00DHHWXYY", "B00005B6JZ", "B00003CXZ4", "B001TODCII"], "bought_together": ["B000P0J09M"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000RETOHY", "B000P0J09M", "B000P0J0EW", "B00AEBB8NI"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 5067}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.5, "brand": "Warner Bros", "asin": "B000M341QE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RZnzpL34L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "Annette Bening is the stand-out highlight in this dysfunctional \"family\" comedy based on the bestselling memoir by Augusten Burroughs. Although fans of the book may be slightly disappointed with the film's uneven and somewhat campy rendition of Burroughs' twisted adolescence in the 1970s, there's plenty of pleasure to be found in the work of an excellent cast led by Bening, who gives a subtle dare-to-hate-me performance as Burroughs' mother Diedre, a would-be poet who's so aloof about her teenage son Augusten (played by fresh-faced newcomer Joseph Cross, fromFlags of Our Fathers) that she allows him to be legally adopted into the eccentric family of her psychiatrist, Dr. Finch (Brian Cox). As the half-crazed Finch overmedicates Diedre into a haze of semi-conscious madness, he also turns Augusten's life upside down while his wife (Jill Clayburgh) and daughters (Gwyneth Paltrow, Evan Rachel Wood) indulge their own eccentricities and Augusten enters into an intimate relationship with one of Finch's adopted patients (played by Joseph Fiennes).As adapted and directed by Nip/Tuck creator Ryan Murphy,Running with Scissorslacks the singular voice of Burroughs' dryly comedic first-person narrative, but even as the film struggles to find a consistent tone, it's so full of wacky behavior that you can't help laughing. It's a messy, patchwork quilt of a movie, blessed by authentically garish '70s production design and a soundtrack of familiar '70s hits. In rendering Burroughs' indelible portrait of weak, irresponsible adults and the people they victimize, Murphy and his well-chosen cast (which also includes Alec Baldwin as Diedre's ex-husband) find moments of touching pathos amidst the madness. For her part, Bening delivers an acclaimed performance that gives the film a dramatic weight it otherwise lacks. The rest is for anyone who enjoys a laugh at the freak-show expense of damaged and damaging characters. --Jeff ShannonStills fromRunning with Scissors(click for larger image)MoreRunning with Scissorson Amazon.comThe BookMore Films staring Annette BeningMore Films about Eccentric Families", "related": {"also_bought": ["031242227X", "125003440X", "031242681X", "0312428278", "0312422288", "0312315953", "0312341911", "0312272057", "B00003CWQR", "0312563558", "B0034G4OZE", "B001TK2BMK", "1250032105", "B000CS464G", "B006G7YSP4", "B000087F7E", "0312315945", "B000JBWWQA", "B000KX0IOK", "B00AEFXESQ", "140006869X", "B00007JXWX", "B00AFEY354", "B00013RC2K", "B0000640VJ", "B00005JMJG", "0312283709", "1427200718", "B00175VSBC", "B0000AC8LR", "B0016MJ6T2", "B00AEFYSWM", "B000EHQU0S", "0307395987", "B00049QQHI", "0312315961", "B002VECLVO", "B004SEUIZG", "6305784817", "B00005Q4CS", "B0007PALGG", "B0006TPE4C", "B00008DP4C", "B00005JLSB", "B00001PE4D", "B00005JLHW", "B000FVQLQQ", "B003L20ICE", "B000N3SU92", "B00004UEDQ", "B0007G89FK", "B000MEYKD2", "B001JIE7JC", "B004FQX5B6", "B0014D5RBE", "B00070EBOY", "B00003CWTI", "B007HRKBI0", "0307396185", "B0057ZAA6W", "B005PTMPYA", "B0041KKYEM", "B00ADRYCWC", "0312938853", "B000F6II1M", "B0001DMVBC", "B0053XZ8O2", "B00008972P", "B0001EFUFK", "B0014GI6I2", "B00DW5IKYS", "B000E33VWW", "B0058ZPNOK", "B006QVRVJK", "B0036TGT8Y", "B00FXWAZW8", "B000QGDY0G", "B004H83IG4", "B005C7SXMS", "B000A7DVR2", "B0016LFG4C", "0800177789", "B002LMV7RA", "B00004TWZH", "B00CC2V7AQ", "B005DI8X3K", "B00EYPJHDI", "B00AEBB9CS", "B00AEFY8MM", "B000H9I1OG", "0316777730", "B00005JLQH", "B000092T3P", "B0043X1FL8", "B0010X8NF0", "B004499LX0", "B00AEFXUXU", "B008N25X7M", "B002DP0J24", "B0007UC8Y4"], "bought_together": ["031242227X", "125003440X"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002HJ3KD6", "125003440X", "1250032105", "B000GQLCQY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 56416}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.5, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B000M5B98A", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51xHRfPC6cL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Running With Scissors"}
{"description": "Morgan Freeman isn't really in every movie that's been made recently; it only seems that way. And considering the variety of roles he's had, it's perhaps appropriate that he plays himself in10 Items or Less. Well, not exactly--Freeman's character has no name, but he is a recognizable actor who's also known as a voice-over specialist, and several references are made to a movie he made with Ashley Judd (although its title is neitherKiss the GirlsnorHigh Crimes, two actual Freeman-Judd flicks). As directed and written by Brad Silberling (Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events, plus a long list of TV credits), the actor is considering taking a part as a store manager in an indie production (his first film role in four years--nudge nudge, wink wink). His research brings him to Archie's Ranch Market, a grim spot in featureless Carson, California, where he meets Scarlet (Paz Vega,Spanglish), who handles the titular check-out line, a dead-end job which, added to her terrible marriage, makes for one unhappy rancher. Finding himself stranded at the store (his driver has vanished, he can't get his agent on the phone, and he doesn't even know his own home number), the gregarious actor takes the feisty, smart-mouthed Scarlet under his wing, prepping her for an interview for a better job, pitching in when she takes her Gremlin to a car wash, helping her pick out some new duds at Target (where the rich movie star discovers the many wonders of discount retailing), and generally bringing her out of her funk; the two bond, and she drives him back to Brentwood. Story-wise, that's about it, which makes the film almost entirely character-driven. That's not a bad thing by any means, but despite Freeman's and Vega's winning performances,10 Items or Lessis little more than a slight, amusing diversion.--Sam Graham", "related": {"also_bought": ["B008B9JTFO", "B000P0I4O4", "B004SEUJOQ", "B0007OCG56", "B0016BWAE6", "B00003CXNJ", "B0019K4YT8", "B00G7QPUII", "B002NO4ISG", "B000F8O2QU", "B00AEFY6PQ", "B000A2IPQY", "B002HGRI82", "B005HWAOP2", "B00AOCDDO4", "B00DHD933W", "B0026VBOHY", "B0010X8NNM", "B004SIP7VM", "B003AWRMCE", "B000UNYK4E", "B007C4ZJ0S", "B0004Z32NI", "B0000A2ZU3", "B000ALM40I", "0783227345", "B001LRJH0U", "B00024JC30", "B001AR011A", "B0000AZT79", "B000FI8MPM", "B0000714BV", "B00005JNC2", "B002NZK5SM", "B000VY1EYG", "B003UESJLU", "B00005JMU1", "B0014D5RBE", "B000IZJZIU", "B0018BD9DA", "B0088X7Z6S", "B00006L92B", "B000WCN8PA", "B00005JL8F", "B00003CWOL", "B00005JMJ4", "B000LPS34E", "B008LFYZAM", "B007L6VRBM", "B003AWRM9M", "B004A8ZX28", "B003Q6D2B4", "B0013XZ6X4", "B00018D3UK", "B008220DGE", "B00005JN0T", "B004HO6HWA", "B000FKO5QK", "B005BUA1JY", "B000NOIX48", "B004A8ZWSS", "B000LXGXY8"], "bought_together": ["B008B9JTFO", "B004SEUJOQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0016BWAE6", "B000244GCW", "B004SIP7VM", "B004SEUJOQ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 102854}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 15.0, "brand": "FIRST LOOK HOME ENTERTAINMENT", "asin": "B000MGUZAM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/519JNdJJWhL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "10 Items or Less"}
{"description": "It takes a certain kind of comic genius to create a character who is, to quote the classic Sondheim lyric, appealing and appalling. But be forewarned:Boratis not \"something for everyone.\" It arrives as advertised as one of the most outrageous, most offensive, and funniest films in years. Kazakhstan journalist Borat Sagdiyev (Sacha Baron Cohen reprising the popular character from hisDa Ali G Show), leaves his humble village to come to \"U.S. and A\" to film a documentary. After catching an episode ofBaywatchin his New York hotel room, he impulsively scuttles his plans and, accompanied by his fat,hirsute producer (Hardy to his Laurel), proceeds to California to pursue the object of his obsession, Pamela Anderson.Boratis not about how he finds America; it's about how America finds him in a series of increasingly cringe-worthy scenes. Borat, with his '70s mustache, well-worn grey suit, and outrageously backwards attitudes (especially where Jews are concerned) interacts with a cross-section of the populace, catching them, a la Alan Funt onCandid Camera, in the act of being themselves. Early on, an unwitting humor coach advises Borat about various types of jokes. Borat asks if his brother's retardation is a ripe subject for comedy. The coach patiently replies, \"That would not be funny in America.\" NOT! Borat is subversively, bracingly funny. When it comes to exploring uncharted territory of what is and is not appropriate or politically correct, Borat knows no boundaries, as when he brings a fancy dinner with the southern gentry to a halt after returning from the bathroom with a bag of his feces (\"The cultural differences are vast,\" his hostess graciously/patronizingly offers), or turns cheers to boos at a rodeo when he calls for bloodlust against the Iraqis and mangles \"The Star Spangled Banner.\"Success, John F. Kennedy once said, has a thousand fathers. A paternity test onBoratmight reveal traces of Bill Dana's Jose Jimenez, Andy Kaufman, Michael Moore,The Jamie Kennedy Xperiment, andJackass. Some scenes seem to have been staged (a game Anderson, whom Borat confronts at a book signing, was reportedly in on the setup), but others, as the growing litany of lawsuits attests, were not. All too real is Borat's encounter with loutish Southern frat boys who reveal their sexism and racism, and the disturbing moment when he asks a gun store owner what gun he would recommend to \"kill a Jew\" (a Glock automatic is the matter-of-fact reply). Comedy is not pretty, and inBoratit can get downright ugly, as when Borat and his producer get jiggly with it during a nude fight that spills out from their hotel room into the hallway, elevator, lobby and finally, a mortgage brokers association banquet. High-five! --Donald LiebensonOn the DVD\"Global Visitings\" capturesBorat-mania in all its hype and glory, as Sacha Baron Cohen, never breaking character, promotes his film around the world. On the itinerary isLate Night with Conan O'Brienand the Toronto Film Festival, a now-legendary screening aborted after a projector malfunction. A mixed bag of deleted scenes finds Borat trying to bait more unsuspecting citizens, including an animal-control worker who refuses Borat a dog after he asks, \"How do you recommend I cook this?\" and a doctor who is nonplussed by Borat's obscene medical history. A supermarket visit offers the most maddening fromage-inspired looniness since Monty Python's \"Cheese Shop\" sketch. Also good for a few chuckles are a faux soundtrack commercial and aBaywatchparody (\"Sexydangerwatch\").--Donald LiebensonBeyondBoratAll things Sacha Baron CohenBoratApparelBoratSoundtrackStills fromBorat(click for larger image)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002P7UCJ0", "B005LAIHGI", "B0002ZMITY", "B002OID4WM", "B00020X852", "B000A88ESW", "B000WZEZGI", "B001G5T6GW", "B005LAIHHC", "B00AEFZ8OY", "B002P7UCJA", "B00005JNZU", "B001DPHDB0", "B001J9KJ4I", "B00G2P79BU", "B000J4QW8Q", "B00AEFYS2M", "B00005JMYI", "B002Q4VBPQ", "B0006GANPA", "B001OD4S50", "6305922756", "B003XJABTK", "B00AEBBA2C", "B008R65XNS", "B000BKVQS4", "B00AEBB9K0", "B003CRM6PA", "B000A7DVR2", "B00AEBB8FQ", "B0016MOV92", "B000BKJ762", "B00009W5CA", "B000AP04L0", "B008220BGQ", "B002T9H2LA", "B00068WOH8", "0385523467", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00008975Z", "B004SIP95G", "B00003CXZ1", "0783229526", "B002ZG99N6", "B003VPX5Y4", "B002SJIO4A", "B00005JLQN", "B00AEFY854", "B00005O3VC", "B004XVMCH6", "B000K7VHQE", "B0006HBZEW", "B00005JMUA", "B000VE439Y", "B00AEFXDO6", "B000EMGJAO", "B0000A02TZ", "B00005JNBQ", "B003Y5H5B0", "B00BEIYMZ6", "B004SIP8ZM", "B000MCH5RM", "B000K7VHOG", "B00005ALS0", "B001UV4X8S", "B00009MGEM", "B0001Z4OXS", "B000C20VPA", "B0012IWNZY", "B00CE00ZV8", "B00005QCVX", "B000I0RNVQ", "B000022TSW", "B001TOD92C", "B000P0J09M", "B00005JL78", "B00AEFYAMA", "B00AEFXGIY", "B000J4P9P8", "B000055Y0X", "B004EPZ084", "B001VLBDD0", "B00AEFY5B6", "B006XZWAWM", "B00005JKMN", "B00AEFY0F2", "B000XFVIOO", "B002GSXKOW", "B00006G8HR", "B000HT386M", "B000MQCUJG", "B00007AJF7", "B00005KA6V", "B004SIP9MY", "B00AEBBA72", "B00018D42W", "B000TZJBPQ", "B0009HBPN0", "B004P9UWM8"], "bought_together": ["B005LAIHGI", "B002P7UCJ0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005LAIHGI", "B000WZEZGI", "B002OID4WM", "B000TZJBPQ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 15271}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.29, "brand": "COHEN,SACHA BARON", "asin": "B000MMMT9G", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51uGbGa68JL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan"}
