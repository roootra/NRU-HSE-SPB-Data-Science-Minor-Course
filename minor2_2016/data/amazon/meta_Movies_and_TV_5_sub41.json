{"description": "There's no getting around a simple, basic truth: watchingLawrence of Arabiain any home-video format represents a compromise. There's no better way to appreciate this epic biographical adventure than to see it projected in 70 millimeter onto a huge theater screen. That caveat aside, David Lean's masterful \"desert classic\" is still enjoyable on the small screen, especially if viewed in widescreen format. (If your only option is to view a \"pan & scan\" version, it's best not to bother; this is a film for which the widescreen format is utterly mandatory.) Peter O'Toole gives a star-making performance as T.E. Lawrence, the eccentric British officer who united the desert tribes of Arabia against the Turks during World War I. Lean orchestrates sweeping battle sequences and breathtaking action, but the film is really about the adventures and trials that transform Lawrence into a legendary man of the desert. Lean traces this transformation on a vast canvas of awesome physicality; no other movie has captured the expanse of the desert with such scope and grandeur. Equally important is the psychology of Lawrence, who remains an enigma even as we grasp his identification with the desert. Perhaps the greatest triumph of this landmark film is that Lean has conveyed the romance, danger, and allure of the desert with such physical and emotional power. It's a film about a man who leads one life but is irresistibly drawn to another, where his greatness and mystery are allowed to flourish in equal measure.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000040EJ", "6305123616", "0800132009", "6304151306", "6304071876", "6303168507", "0792839846", "630150528X", "6304196954", "630018224X", "B0000048ZL", "B000005PFL", "6300215539", "0792844645", "6302464889", "0780616456", "6300216721", "6300246965", "0783235593", "0792837630", "6301628454", "6302909023", "B000059HGY", "6302415853", "6301976622", "6305282927", "0790743213", "6303020089", "6300214060", "0783216084", "6305261296", "B00003CXE6", "6301662954", "B000003KHS", "0800179552", "B000056BRF", "079213690X", "630105573X", "B00000F6D1", "6300215814", "6300185095", "B00005Q4GY", "0792133153", "6301971809", "6301628667", "6303494390", "B00004TIUO", "6300214567", "6300214826", "6300181340", "6303402348", "B000EO7AIC", "B00005A1VH", "0783235607", "0790732017", "6303057225", "0800199421", "0790733927", "6304935811", "6301016289", "6303383300", "0790752395", "6302610702", "0783221347", "0790701251", "0783231482", "630018627X", "0790734079", "B000003KDG", "B00005OCPO", "0792836553", "B000062XM6", "0800125762", "0792108280", "6302800420", "B00005QATY", "6300181286", "5559477621", "6301208773", "6301888901", "B00005A7VC", "B00005LMA7", "1558807780", "B00007JME0", "B00000I1EM", "6304111398", "6300183513", "6303402070", "0792116887", "6303203337", "0790744589", "6300251012", "6302256615", "0792110463", "6300183084", "B000006GCU", "B00004RFFA", "630347327X", "6302023742", "079283853X"], "bought_together": ["B0000040EJ", "6305123616"], "also_viewed": ["6305123616", "B000054OW2", "6305363668", "B00BBND56G", "0782008348", "0792836510", "6304117752", "0783216084", "6303402070", "0792839846", "6302610702", "6304539258", "1558807780", "0792158261", "B0000040EJ", "6302909023"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 425814}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.89, "brand": "VHS", "asin": "0767812778", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51CAQY4V9AL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Lawrence of Arabia (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]"}

{"description": "As \"gigantic monster reptile attacks New York\" movies go, you've got to admit thatGodzilladelivers the goods, although its critical drubbing and box-office disappointment were arguably deserved. It's a shameless, uninspired crowd pleaser that's content to serve up familiar action with the advantage of really fantastic special effects, and if you expect nothing more you'll be one among millions of satisfied customers. There's really no other way to approach it--you just have to accept the fact thatIndependence Daycreators Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin are unapologetic plagiarists, incapable of anything more than mindless spectacle that can play in any cinema in the world without dubbing or subtitles. The whole movie plays out like a series of highlights stolen from previous blockbusters of the 1990s; it's little more than a rehash of theJurassic Parkmovies. The derivative script is so trivial that it's unworthy of comment, apart from a few choice laughs and the casting of Michael Lerner as New York's mayor, whose name is Ebert and who closely resembles a certain well-known movie critic. Perhaps that's a clever hint that this movie's essentially critic-proof. It's stupid but it's fun, and for most audiences that's a fitting definition of mainstream Hollywood entertainment.

{"description": "Philadelphiawasn't the first movie about AIDS (it followed such worthy independent films asParting GlancesandLongtime Companion), but it was the first Hollywood studio picture to take AIDS as its primary subject. In that sense,Philadelphiais a historically important film. As such, it's worth remembering that director Jonathan Demme (Melvin and Howard,Something Wild,The Silence of the Lambs) wasn't interested in preaching to the converted; he set out to make a film that would connect with a mainstream audience. And he succeeded.Philadelphiawas not only a hit, it also won Oscars for Bruce Springsteen's haunting &quot;The Streets of Philadelphia,&quot; and for Tom Hanks as the gay lawyer Andrew Beckett who is unjustly fired by his firm because he has AIDS. Denzel Washington is another lawyer (functioning as the mainstream-audience surrogate) who reluctantly takes Beckett's case and learns to overcome his misconceptions about the disease, about those who contract it, and about gay people in general. The combined warmth and humanism of Hanks and Demme were absolutely essential to making this picture a success. The cast also features Jason Robards, Antonio Banderas (as Beckett's lover), Joanne Woodward, and Robert Ridgely, and, of course, those Demme regulars Charles Napier, Tracey Walter, and Roger Corman.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B000003KHS", "6301792734"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 602343}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 0.9, "brand": "", "asin": "0767809270", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51PPAS4K30L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Philadelphia [VHS]"}
{"description": "Penny Marshall's popular 1992 comedy sheds light on a little-known chapter of American sports history with its story of a struggling team in the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. The league was formed when the recruiting of soldiers during World War II resulted in a shortage of men's baseball teams. The AAGPBL continued after the war (until 1954), and Marshall's movie depicts the league in full swing, beginning when a savvy baseball scout (Jon Lovitz) finds a pair of promising new players in small-town Oregonian sisters (Geena Davis, Lori Petty). The sisters are signed to play for the Rockford Peaches near Chicago, whose new manager (Tom Hanks) is a former home-run king who wrecked his career with alcoholism. They're all a bunch of underdogs, and Marshall (with a witty script by Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel) does a fine job of establishing a colorful team of supporting players including Madonna and (in her movie debut) Rosie O'Donnell. It's a conventional Hollywood sports story (Marshall's never been one to take dramatic risks), but the stellar cast is delightful, and the movie's filled with memorable moments, witty dialogue, and agreeable sentiment. And just remember: there's no crying in baseball!--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783235968", "630141277X", "6302534372", "0767809262", "6303506291", "B00005M20M", "0792151712"], "also_viewed": ["B000003KMM", "B0012GMZZY", "630596260X", "0783235968", "B00B4804KS"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 393057}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.17, "brand": "", "asin": "076780922X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51A158TD4RL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "A League of Their Own [VHS]"}
{"description": "Forever embroiled in controversy,Midnight Expressdivides viewers into opposing camps: those who think it's one of the most intense real-life dramas ever made, and those who abhor its manipulative tactics and alteration of facts for the exploitative purpose of achieving a desired effect. That effect is powerfully achieved, regardless of how you may feel about director Alan Parker and Oscar&reg;-winning screenwriter Oliver Stone's interpretation of the story of Billy Hayes. It was the American Hayes--played by the late Brad Davis in an unforgettable performance--who was caught smuggling two kilograms of hashish while attempting to board a flight from Istanbul, Turkey, in 1970. He was sentenced to four years in a hellish Turkish prison on a drug possession charge, but his sentence was later extended (though not by 30 years, as the film suggests), and Hayes endured unthinkable brutality and torture before his escape in 1975.Unquestionably, this is a superbly crafted film, provoking a visceral response that's powerful enough to boil your blood. By the time Hayes erupts in an explosion of self-defensive violence, Parker and Stone have proven the power--and danger--of their skill. Their film is deeply manipulative, extremely xenophobic, and embellishes reality to heighten its calculated impact. Is that a crime? Not necessarily, and there's no doubt thatMidnight Expressis expertly directed and blessed with exceptional supporting performances (especially from John Hurt as a long-term prisoner). Still, it's obvious that strings are being pulled, and Parker, while applying his talent to a nefarious purpose, is a masterful puppeteer.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0008ENHUI", "0988981440", "0792833287", "B006TTC5HC", "B00007ELEY", "B004FQX5B6", "B000RTB0R6", "B000CNESTE", "B000001FBZ", "B0071HPP3M", "B00AEFXVOI", "B00AEBB95K", "B0019UGYK0", "B003ELKNH2", "0767830555", "B000059TFO", "B00079Z9VO", "B00013RC2U", "B0006GANN2", "B00005MEOU", "B00AEFXN9G", "079284646X", "B000C20VPA", "B000P0J0AG", "B0006GAOJA", "B00008O38F", "B00AEBB9UK", "B00AEFXX9Q", "B007N31YH0", "B000067IZ3", "0792846443", "6305132917", "B000A2UBN4", "B002AT8KAG", "B00AEFXV3E", "B000C20VRS", "0792838408", "B000286RP2", "B0038Z5T4Q", "B00066FBQG", "B000P0J0EW", "B00049QJ9I", "B001PYD0PC", "0800141806", "B00AEFYRP0", "B0000YEEGM", "B0000DI87S", "B0002V7ON8", "B00407PNY2", "B001R3YRG2", "B003O7I6SE", "B00AEFXEZE", "6304765258", "B000EHSVS2", "B00005U2KC", "B003TRMLQM", "B00005M2CO", "B000063US2", "B0045HCJFS", "B00AEFXBPM", "B0001US62I", "B000E5N684", "B003LMPKSQ", "B001G1FL3S", "B00009W5CA", "B000022TSY", "B00005LC4D", "B000KGGJ0Y", "B00GUO2SKA", "B00011CZRE", "B000ZM1MG4", "B00005JXY5", "B00005NB8K", "B00006ADD5", "B000P0J09M", "B000PAAJZ6", "B004SIP8ZM", "B0013XZ2QK", "B007UW9W5U", "B00B0U2SFE", "B000059HAN", "B0010YVCI4", "B00004ZBVF", "B0009UZG3C", "B00H9KKGTO", "B00AEFXD1O", "B000XJD34I", "B00IA7MFEO", "B00002VWE0", "B000M341QE", "B0007KIFGE", "B00007BKVC", "B003ASLJJK", "B00AEBBADG", "B007TBIUSM", "B00AEFXG2U", "B000LP6KNU", "B00005JLRE", "B003INBNOS"], "bought_together": ["B0008ENHUI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0988981440", "078322947X", "B003ELKNH2", "B00005PJ8T"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 132494}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.28, "brand": "", "asin": "0767817486", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/714SYCVAS8L._SY300_.gif", "title": "Midnight Express"}

On the streets of Szechuan Province in the 1930s, the aged King of Masks, sole living master of \"change-face\" opera, delights and frightens audiences with the secret art of lightning-quick mask-shifting. His fondest wish is to pass on his skill to a male heir before he dies. Famous female impersonator Liang Sao Lang craves knowledge of the king's secret technique, offering to relieve the old man's poverty by taking him into his opera troupe. The king declines: what sort of heir would this half-female creature make? Instead, he buys an orphan on the black market, joyously showing him off as his grandson and heir. But soon the child is forced to disclose a dreaded secret--one that effectively renders him a person of no value according to Chinese custom. In the king's eyes, the kid goes from \"beloved grandson\" to \"stupid crook,\" and both the old man and the  child must pay dearly for his bigotry before they can know joy again.

Joining the fun is Julia Roberts as Tinkerbell, Bob Hoskins as the pirate Smee, and Maggie Smith as Granny Wendy Darling, who must convince middle-aged lawyer Peter Banning that he was once the legendary Peter Pan. And so the adventure begins anew, with Peter off to Neverland to save his two children from Captain Hook. Along the way, he rediscovers the power of imagination, friendship, and of magic. A classic tale updated for children of all ages, HOOK was nominated for five 1991 Academy Awards(r) including Best Visual Effects.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000031EGV", "B0001HAISG", "B000QQLVPQ", "B000P0J09W", "B000065V42", "B00028HBES", "B00CQRN3QI", "B0087F7VSY", "0783219806", "6305428042", "B00003CXC3", "B00005JG6M", "B002GHHHNS", "B004GJYROG", "1558908404", "B00008L3U1", "B004SIP7PS", "B0000VCZKW", "B000Y11B7G", "B001AGXEAG", "B0000AK7AA", "B006JN87WK", "B005F96UJ6", "B00005T7I1", "B000XKW2WG", "B00CNW9ZI6", "B0000VV4WW", "B0087ZG7HK", "B000P0J0A6", "B002NZK5SW", "B0001I562I", "B000068QPM", "B00008979O", "B00AO686MY", "B00CTQWJEI", "B001KVZ6FW", "B002CLBJPK", "B00AEFXXMI", "B00AFEX83C", "B0000AOX0O", "B0039N74CW", "B00000IQV7", "0800177258", "B002GJTYIW", "0800177991", "B00AJCUL2G", "B00008977A", "6304711913", "B0000UJDLM", "B004LWZW9W", "B000056H29", "B00008K76U", "B002NZK5V4", "B000Z8GZYW", "B000089778", "B0006J28MI", "B0013XZ76K", "B001LMAK9W", "B00AKGG6E8", "B000N4RAR4", "B000ZM1MG4", "B0013FSL3E", "B000089G5L", "B0007KTBIU", "0783219733", "B00005TN8K", "B001HN694K", "B000EGDB10", "B000MRNWKG", "B00007AJGH", "B000YDBPAM", "B008JFUQ16", "B0000VV4W2", "0767851013", "B00EV1YZ96", "B000VKL6RK", "B0009RCPY8", "B002VWNID6", "B0000WN0UU", "6305428387", "B0000633U2", "B00CWM58WY", "B0064SVO9I", "B0084IHVUC", "B00AEFXPG2", "B00AEBB8KQ", "B00008979N", "B0043X1FOK", "B00003CXB4", "B000ARXF96", "B0002V7OI8", "B0084IHVGG", "B00AEFYVZQ", "B0030IIZ4M", "B000YERP2S", "B0001I561E", "B00AEFYIQ8", "B00CHVJODE", "B006VRRGNK"], "bought_together": ["B000031EGV", "B000P0J09W"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00028HBES", "B000031EGV", "B000065V42", "B00CQRN3QI"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 2740}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.0, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "0767836324", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51xvJ6-MWOL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Hook"}

{"description": "Previously filmed in 1933 (asIsland of Lost Souls) and 1977, the classic H.G. Wells story was filmed again for this graphic 1996 version. The film was roasted by critics, but it's an utterly fascinating failure, largely due to the performances of David Thewlis, Val Kilmer, and especially Marlon Brando in the title role as a mad (and in this case outrageously bizarre) scientist whose experiments in crossbreeding humans with animals have gone terribly awry. Thewlis plays the wayward scholar who is rescued at sea by Kilmer and brought to Moreau's island to discover the doctor's unnatural &quot;children.&quot; Fairuza Balk plays Moreau's half-cat daughter, but it's Brando and Kilmer (in one scene doing a killer Brando impersonation) who steal the show, along with the astounding makeup effects created by Stan Winston. A guilty pleasure by any measure, this movie has definite cult-favorite potential, and in addition to offering a &quot;director's cut&quot; with previously unseen footage, the DVD includes audio commentary by director John Frankenheimer, who replaced the original director on short notice and completed this film under highly stressful conditions.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005K3OB", "B005D0RDKM", "B00005JKLZ", "B00AEFY4IA", "155890848X", "B00003CXIV", "B00GSXE0B8", "B00004ZBVM", "B00HW3EJ6Y", "0486290271", "B003EYVXSW", "B00014X8DG", "B0045HCJ0S", "B00000IBL0", "B00079HZQ6", "B003VRV9DG", "B00IKM5LXG", "B002U4UZSQ", "B008NA3I1W", "B000A2UBN4", "B00CERJI5U", "B000063JDE", "B00IE41A9O", "B000OVLBHG", "B0000AOX0F", "B00004ZBVF", "B003WTO5NO", "B00009PY4I", "B000KHI2FS", "B00AEFXW8I", "0800177029", "B0045HCJSU", "B003L2M584", "B00AEFYXQI", "B00070FX5U", "B004AC6PMG", "6305127646", "B001I04QCO", "B00004W4UB", "B00005O439", "B000QQJ3Q0", "B00022XE6S", "B006WQHP4A", "B00005R2IS", "1619492334", "B004P7CMZ0", "B00004TJJV", "B001ECDVKE", "B00005B6L0", "B0045HCJKS", "B00HEPDGKA", "6305313687", "B002WY64IY", "B0002B15WY", "B0050MB5KM", "630469654X", "B0002IQLH6", "B000BRBA9C", "B00005O06X", "079073639X", "B0024FADD8", "B0051CSIKQ", "B0007RTBA6", "B000HC2LFI", "B000JLQQ94", "B005OT810I", "B000WC389G", "B0018O4YT0", "B0009X76XC", "B000TSIJWY", "B000QFCDGS", "B000U1ZV6W", "B00003CXKM", "B000067J0M", "B000NQRR1Q", "B00008G6E8", "B001DZOC6Y", "B004GSVXA8", "B000068MBS", "B000GBEWRU", "B0045HCJ9O", "B0007R4T1W", "B00J11U54K", "B00003CXCF", "B0006LB5AC", "B00005O5AX", "B0000VCZNE", "B00005RDAI", "B000XT1P4S", "6304712499", "B000E6ESEO", "B001DB6J50", "B002EP8FDI", "B000PFUAP0", "B00000JPH6", "B000A2IPQY", "B000B6CO3Y", "B004P7CN7W", "B000IJ7A5Q"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005K3OB", "B000HT38E4", "0486290271", "B00HEPDGKA"]}, "price": 15.52, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 16728}, "asin": "0780619951", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51QSKY0A5ZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Island of Dr. Moreau (Unrated Director's Cut)"}

{"description": "Sight unseen, it's tempting to dismissPoison Ivyas a teen variation on your standard trashy erotic thriller, a genre born with such promise inBody Heatthat has since been in steady devolution. But whileIvyis noHeat, it's better than virtually any of those movies that star someone named Shannon. Crisp directing is supported by a script that takes a smart look at dysfunctional family dynamics, but most of all, it's the performances. Much has been made of Drew Barrymore's perfect casting as the title character, but she also does a sneaky and subtle job of straddling the fence: is Ivy a desperate, lonely young woman, an evil barracuda, or both? Tom Skerritt matches her step for step, playing the fallen husband as both hopelessly vain boob and genuinely lost soul. Cheryl Ladd delivers a sharp, minimalist performance as his Beverly Hills trophy wife dying of emphysema--becoming the still-life center of everyone else's life. And Sara Gilbert does a fine job in a role that gives her all the heavy lifting, playing tortured straight man to this pathetic and compelling tree full of coconuts. This DVD features both R-rated and unrated versions. The latter shows a bit more skin, although it's still fairly tame compared to the average skin flick. It also leaves Ivy a bit more ambiguous, and is thus a bit more fun.--Geof Miller", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000HT38EO", "B00004RF85", "B001LMU1NC", "B00E8G5HXM", "B00005IAQ7", "B0001GF2D8", "B00000JGOI", "B00006SFJJ", "B000PMFS2I", "078322933X", "B000099T3S", "B00001YXH8", "B0001US7UY", "B0045HCJGW", "6305433917", "0767817710", "B00005QW5T", "B00008HCC9", "B0000542C7", "B00005BCP5", "B0002KPIQY", "B00005JMIJ", "B0045O2PHS", "B00AEFXX9Q", "B00002RAO2", "B0000C3I96", "B003CPPY6K", "6305268827", "B00013RC7K", "B00008DP4C", "B0020LH8WU", "B00AEFXBPM", "B000EQ5SRK", "B0045HCIYA", "B004SUDQC2", "B000059TG7", "6305213305", "B00005JH9M", "B00366F2NU", "B000BX0VT6", "B000E5N684", "B005ZVIPG0", "B0010V60YI", "0767802616", "B00441GYVK", "B00049QQHI", "B005Z9MGRG", "B00DW5IKYS", "B000BBOUUE", "B00827OWO8", "B000MMMTBY", "B0037QGS0A", "B0002IQLHQ", "B001CRC4DG", "B00003CWQR", "B00ET2ODTE", "B000GI3KGC", "B000EZ9084", "B004SIP9MY", "0780618548", "B00005V4XV", "B000HC2LJE", "B00FB349R6", "0792842960", "B00005JKJS", "B00005JKJA", "B000QUEQ4K", "B00EMAGKNU", "B00000JGHK", "B0010X8NNM", "B00005U14H", "B00AEBB9LO", "157362618X", "B00AEBBA2W", "B00AEFXESQ", "0792839684", "B00005JPXA", "630529335X", "B00AEFXO8Q", "B00001PE4D", "B00023P4M4", "6305127654", "B00441GYVA", "B000053VB2", "B002Q3MZXE", "6305505802", "B0000ALPFL", "B0053TWVSC", "B0009R1TI6", "B00EVU3T26", "B00DMUFXOS", "B00004W4UD", "B005OK0YVG", "076780760X", "B00008972P", "B00003CWN3", "B000P0J0CY", "B000063JDE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000HT38EO", "B001LMU1NC", "B00004RF85", "0780627806"]}, "price": 13.48, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 53939}, "asin": "0780627776", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/413AVPXKBZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Poison Ivy (Unrated &amp; R-Rated Versions)"}

{"description": "Theatrically released in 1991 asHighlander II: The Quickening, this sequel was later reedited and gained a small but loyal following (prompting a spinoff TV series), but at the time of its release critic Roger Ebert called it &quot;the most hilariously incomprehensible movie ... almost awesome in its badness.&quot; In other words, you might find some guilty pleasure in this chaotic sequel to 1986'sHighlander, in which Christopher Lambert reprises his role as Connor MacLeod, a member of the alien race known as &quot;Immortals,&quot; banished to Earth from his home planet Zeist some 500 years ago. In the year 1999, Lambert owns a corporation that has created a shield to protect the Earth following the depletion of the ozone layer. But the shield is seized by an evil cartel, and Virginia Madsen plays a scientist who assists MacLeod in his mission to destroy the cartel. Sean Connery also reprises his role fromHighlanderas the Scottish Immortal named Ramirez (?!), but by the time he starts engaging in dashing swordplay you may wonder if he's wandered in from another movie altogether.Highlanderfans welcomed the laserdisc and DVD release of this &quot;renegade&quot; director's cut, which attempts to clarify the original version's confusing plot.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004U7MQY2", "B004U7MQYC", "B001JFZ118", "B0010YVCAM", "B000NOKAK8", "B0007DA3V6", "B00092A1J4", "B000OYCMNU", "B001URA5W0", "B000LP6L2U", "B001AQO3XS", "B00006LPCK", "B0001BKBGQ", "B00HEPDGKA", "B00005O5B6", "B00009MEJT", "B0000CABIJ", "B00020HCBI", "0790738511", "B008JFUS0U", "B00IKM5LXG", "B0085A9HU6", "B0001ZX0GA", "B0001NBLYK", "B004P7CMDM", "0783225741", "B00J4LMHMK", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B00EKUXDSW", "B00004WEJZ", "B008JFUNHI", "B00J9BZ4KC", "B0000640VR", "B001B3LIOC", "B00070FX5U", "B00006RCOC", "B005LAIGW8", "B005LAII44", "B00005N5S5", "6304711891", "B0013RF25M", "B001FB55HQ", "B00003CXIV", "B00004Y631", "B0090SI56Y", "B0001A9I5W", "B001BEK8HO", "B0053TWVIM", "B00004STDN", "B0000VD12I", "B003L20IEW", "B000UW1NKE", "B0000VCZK2", "6304936532", "B00A2H9OSK", "B000QUCRB4", "B000M2DLJ8", "6305558167", "B003QO8TOQ", "B000AYELFQ", "0783225814", "1573624667", "B00BUAEYVK", "B000P7V4R6", "0783226888", "B00AIBZKV0", "B005LS4MQY", "B000VI70QS", "6304712499", "B0045HCJ9O", "B004LWZW4M", "B00004TJJV", "B00HDU9UOW", "0783114885", "0767817710", "B000E6ESEY", "B0045HCIWM", "B0045HCJRG", "B00GJNQ4B6", "6305245487", "B002O3Z4WK", "B0000844I8", "B0006UEVUE", "630469654X", "B00AZMFJYA", "B00009ATIM", "B008Y1YK9Y", "B0000524EB", "0783226063", "B0001Z37HM", "B00003CXC5", "B000U1ZV8K", "B0050ODZ6M", "B00008G8M4", "B000LC4Z7Q", "B004EPYZT4", "B00008WFU5", "076780970X", "B00F3L8P26"], "bought_together": ["B001JFZ118", "B004U7MQY2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001JFZ118", "B004U7MQY2", "B004U7MQYC", "B0010YVCAM"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 273607}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 24.99, "brand": "", "asin": "0782008380", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516F7VY0HCL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Highlander II: Renegade Version"}

{"description": "Now you can achieve multiple viewings of the bestSexon TV.  Winner of Golden Globes for Best TV Series and Best Actress,Sex and the Cityis based on Candace Bushnell's provocativebestselling book. Sarah Jessica  Parker stars as Carrie Bradshaw, a self-described \"sexual anthropologist,\" who writes \"Sex and the City,\" a newspaper column that chronicles the state of sexual affairs of Manhattanites in this \"age of un-innocence.\" Her \"posse,\" including nice girl Charlotte (Kristin Davis), hard-edged Miranda (Cynthia Nixon), and party girl  Samantha (Kim Cattrall)--not to mention her own tumultuous love life--gives Carrie plenty of column fodder. Over the course of the first season's 12&nbsp;episodes, the most prominent dramatic arc concerns Carrie, who goes from turning the tables on \"toxic bachelors\" by having \"sex like a man\" to wanting to join the ranks of \"the monogamists\" with the elusive Mr.&nbsp;Big (Chris Noth). Meanwhile, Miranda, Cynthia, and Samantha have their own dating woes, few of which can be described on a family Web site.Seinfeldhas nothing onSex and the Citywhen it comes to shallow, self-absorbed characters or coining catch phrases. Episode&nbsp;2, for example, introduces the term \"modelizer\": a guy who is obsessed with and will only date models. Some may accuse this series of male bashing. But women, after years of enduring shows with \"men behaving badly,\" will relish the equal time. Some may blanch at the ladies' graphic language and ribald humor, or dismiss some of the situations as unrealistic (Carrie doesn't bat an eye when she discovers that an artist friend surreptitiously videotapes his sexual conquests). Still others will viewSex and the Cityas documentary.

{"description": "Steven Spielberg's 1993 mega-hit rivalsJawsas the most intense and frightening film he'd ever made prior toSchindler's List, but it was also among his weakest stories. Based on Michael Crichton's novel about an island amusement park populated by cloned dinosaurs, the film works best as a thrill ride with none of the interesting human dynamics of Spielberg'sJaws. That lapse proves unfortunate, but there's no shortage of raw terror as a rampaging T-rex and nasty raptors try to make fast food out of the cast.

{"description": "Heavy-metal golf with Adam Sandler, a 1996 dry run of the wild-man-athlete formula that paid off so handsomely inThe Waterboy. There are some irresistibly funny sequences, although you may hate yourself for laughing at the mean-spirited slapstick. This isn't a classic golf comedy, like the Bill Murray vehicleCaddyshack, but as a hot-tempered would- be hockey player who finds an unexpected m&#xE9;tier as a power golfer, Sandler has a short-fuse shtick that's effectively deployed. He's like a punk rocker gleefully out of his element, puncturing the country-club atmosphere by using the fairway as a private mosh pit. The action gets repetitive beyond the midpoint, and a subplot involving Gilmore's lovable grandma and her problems with the IRS is dismayingly sappy. Sandler's iconoclasm is mostly window dressing; there's no conceptual or satirical daring in his kind of \"outrageousness.\" The strong supporting cast includes Christopher McDonald as Gilmore's smug rival on the links, Julie Bowen as a perky publicist, and, in a memorable bout of fisticuffs with our hero, game-show host Bob Barker. Director Dennis Dugan  (Problem Child) himself plays Doug Thompson, the golf-tour supervisor.--David Chute", "related": {"also_bought": ["0788816454", "6300989003"], "bought_together": ["0788816454"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 177944}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 0.49, "brand": "", "asin": "0783219105", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51G6A1H2BAL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Happy Gilmore [VHS]"}

{"description": "Directed by Sidney Lumet (Serpico) and penned by Joel Schumacher (Batman and Robin), this lavish 1978 adaptation of the Broadway hitThe Wizwas the biggest production filmed in New York City up to that point, utilizing the newly revamped Astoria Studios and locations around the city. Diana Ross, Michael Jackson, Nipsey Russell, and Ted Ross (reprising his Tony-winning role as the Lion) star in this Academy Award-nominated musical for the whole family.The Wizis probably the grandest take on L.&nbsp;Frank Baum's classic  taleThe Wizard of Oz.  The  production team created sets with a sense of urban magic and spectacle: a New York subway station literally comes to life, and the massive plaza between the World Trade Center towers is transformed into the Emerald City, featuring nearly 400 dancers with three costume changes. Like all good musicals, theQuincy Jones arrangementsare highly hummable long after viewing (especially the funky \"Ease On Down the Road\" and the inspirational \"Brand New Day\"). In an era before MTV, the camera stays nearly stationary as Ross and Lena Horne vocally soar through their numbers. Their stage-like performances successfully make the leap to film, makingThe Wiza testament to their singing talents and star presence. The then-thirtysomething Ross raised some eyebrows playing the traditionally teenaged Dorothy, but she and her supporting cast (including Richard Pryor as the Wiz) carry the tunes with an infectious verve that will appeal to folks of all ages.--Shannon Gee", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000B5XOSY", "B00004Z4SE", "B000002I8P", "B000002P75", "B00CNW9ZI6", "B00007AJG2", "B0084NZEE2", "B0033TJATW", "B00005A1T0", "B000JLTRH2", "B002CWKU36", "B0000VCZKM", "B00005TQ44", "B00008CMRM", "B0000DZ3EN", "B007OAAK0O", "B000BUE5FA", "B00465I1CE", "B002TYZKIM", "B00005RIIY", "0573680914", "B00441GZ1Y", "B002LFJXL4", "B00C7JGDBW", "B0000TWMQ6", "B000BNTMAA", "B000BOH922", "B00005JO4H", "B005F96UJ6", "B000Y11B8K", "B0000AM6IY", "B002LFJXKU", "B0002HCWQQ", "B003YCL0SM", "B000065V3J", "B00000J2KE", "B0000W5J4A", "B000A2RRF4", "B00066FAOE", "B00014X83G", "B000667HHW", "B00JDB4PEY", "B0030A0ZD4", "B00005RDAN", "B002D0L0R2", "1476705968", "1849382611", "B00465I192", "B0009A40NO", "B000056WR6", "B00BYS0RQE", "B000GDI27E", "076781326X", "B001DJLD12", "B003NH42HE", "B00003L9CK", "B004498KPU", "B00006RJAA", "B00004XMTJ", "B00E1HIX66", "B0084I9QIW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00004Z4SE", "B00CNW9ZI6", "B0033TJATW", "B00JDB4PEY"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 64202}, "asin": "0783233493", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/610WYFVWY5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Wiz"}

{"description": "Set in Harlem and New Orleans in 1955, this supernatural thriller stirred a brief controversy when released in 1987 because some scenes featuring Lisa Bonet (then a popular cast member ofThe Cosby Show) were considered too sexually explicit to be rated R. The edited material was restored for the unrated video release, and the movie now makes a fitting double bill withFallen, with its similar plot about a sullen detective (Mickey Rourke) who is hired to find a missing person by a shady client with pointy fingernails named Louis Cyphre (Lucifer, get it?), played with subtle menace by Robert De Niro. Rourke's investigation leads him into an underworld of voodoo and forbidden desires, and as the mystery unfolds director Alan Parker fills every scene with conspicuous style and atmospheric excess, compelling critic Pauline Kael to observe that, &quot;Parker simply doesn't have the gift of making evil seductive, and he edits like a flasher.&quot; And yet, this movie does cast a spell of its own (Roger Ebert's review was considerably more charitable), and the performances of Rourke, De Niro, Bonet, and Charlotte Rampling are well suited to the ominous mood.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000AOX0E", "B003TRMLQM", "B0007VZ99E", "B002AS463W", "B00006JMPS", "B000059TFP", "B00005JKI5", "B0045HCJSU", "B002DYYGO2", "1453271139", "B00007EFIJ", "B000068IEX", "B00007BK2R", "B002CTJW0G", "B0009R1TI6", "B00004RE27", "B004LYWPZE", "B001U0HB5Q", "B00005V9HX", "0790750198", "B000HC2LHG", "B001TOD92C", "1573623857", "076782170X", "6305132917", "B00005JKJA", "0767830555", "B0006GAOJA", "B0000AOX0A", "B0001FGBW0", "6305238065", "6305308837", "B00008DDVY", "B000286RP2", "B003KV3E2C", "B0000DI87S", "6305262268", "B000E5N684", "B00005BCKG", "B000A2UBN4", "B0000542CH", "B000GGSMC6", "B0028OH568", "B0052ADPAU", "0859653862", "6305065551", "B000069HZO", "B000056PNL", "0783228457", "B000CR76U8", "B0045HCIYA", "B000TGJ80S", "0783225903", "B002VWNICC", "B0002KQNKE", "B00008CMRK", "B000NA1WEK", "B0019BI1DM", "6304936532", "B00008O38F", "B0002KPHZG", "B000ICL3NI", "B000P0J0AG", "B000QQFKYE", "B000063JDE", "B00008L3S6", "B001J710Y8", "079073219X", "B0041QSZM4", "B00E8G5HXM", "B00006RCNV", "6305177937", "B00827OWO8", "B000ZM1MGE", "B0024FADD8", "B00005V4XV", "B0056GLNLI", "B00096S48U", "B007XF0W3K", "B000059LGL", "B00007L4KF", "B00AEFXW8I", "0792833287", "B0045HCJTO", "B00013RC66", "B0006Z2LH4", "B00006L92U", "B0055CP9TU", "B00005LC4D", "B00005B6L0", "B00AEFXX9Q", "B00AEFXR8I", "B0013D8LKO", "B00003CXCF", "B000YENUI6", "B0002KPIQY", "B0016I0AJG", "B0043X1FNQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002AS463W", "B003TRMLQM", "B0041QSZTW", "6305065551"]}, "price": 12.08, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 295510}, "asin": "078401115X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51V7MKFPHCL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Angel Heart"}
{"description": "The only real problem withStir of Echoeshas nothing to do with the movie itself, but with unlucky coincidence. Adapted from a Richard Mathesonnovel, this film  arrived around the same time asThe Sixth Sense, and surface similarities made it suffer by cursory comparison and the competing film's phenomenal success. It's a pity, because this one features one of Kevin Bacon's best performances, in a psychological thriller that makes a lot more right moves than wrong ones. Bacon plays a blue-collar guy who laments his ordinary life, only to learn, when his sister-in-law (Ileanna Douglas) hypnotizes him, that he is a \"receiver\" capable of seeing spirits and split-second glimpses of past and future events. It's a torturous gift to have--especially since his friendly Chicago neighborhood possesses a dark secret--and Bacon plays the role with an appropriate mixture of obsession and internalized torment.Similarity toThe Sixth Senseapplies only to the basic premise and the character of Bacon's young son. Otherwise, this is more of a hard-edged journey of self-discovery, marital crisis, and recovery, with Bacon's wife (played by the highly underrated Kathryn Erbe) involved in an underdeveloped subplot about a group of people who share Bacon's gift as paranormal \"receivers.\" Furthering his career as a writer-director of intelligent thrillers, David Koepp makes a few missteps in pacing and thematic overkill, but overallStir of Echoesis a sharp, sensitive thriller that unfolds to reveal a dramatically satisfying solution to its mystery.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEBBA2W", "B00004BZIY", "B00006AUJR", "B000VKKV3K", "B004SIP92O", "0800177789", "B00005JNY3", "6305718954", "B00007AJE1", "B000TJ6PBK", "B0001FR3IQ", "B00003CXKA", "B00AEFYYH6", "B002O3Z4Y8", "B0000648X0", "B002NZK5RI", "B00005JL3T", "0783222149", "B000V4UFZK", "B003VA3JUO", "B00003CWRF", "B000HT38IK", "B00009WVSL", "B0097C046W", "B00005JH9M", "B00008DDGY", "0783116926", "B004LWZW24", "B004AC6PV2", "B00008EY9G", "B0009X763M", "0783226837", "B0021L8UFI", "0783240295", "B00BEIYMAG", "B00011CZRE", "B00005UQ9W", "B004EPYZO4", "B002DKGWSE", "B0021L8UXA", "B0024FADD8", "B003ASLJQS", "6305161933", "155890848X", "B0001GF2D8", "B00064LJVE", "B009XTF8KQ", "B000Y7U97I", "B002GHHHN8", "B00EZ50SGW", "B00005JKZH", "B002JT69IW", "0767817737", "B00AEFYF2K", "6304711891", "B00KU2ZKKI", "0792840127", "B005LAIGOQ", "B001KKU9CI", "B001JNNDJM", "B00AZTUUQK", "B000U7169M", "B00026ZD04", "B002VWNIDG", "B002O3Z4WK", "B00AJLHUA8", "B003L20IEW", "B0002IQLHQ", "B000AM4P9K", "B00AEFY4CG", "B00IJS2OR2", "B00009PY4G", "B000OVLBGM", "B001BP4K22", "B001R3YRG2", "B0002234LS", "B0000694XX", "B00B96TGQS", "B002AT8K9W", "B000NIVJF4", "B000HC2LFI", "6305065551", "B00AIBZKV0", "B00013RC7K", "B004SUDQDG", "0792159659", "B000GFLKF8", "B0021L8UPS", "B00AEBB91E", "B000PMLJMQ", "B0001IMCFC", "B002NZK5SM", "6305428115", "B000LP6KNU", "B00006FDCD", "6304806434", "B00AEFXKZ8", "B008Y1YK7G", "B0006SGYL0"], "bought_together": ["B00AEBBA2W", "B00004BZIY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004SIP92O", "B004AC6PWG", "B00AEBBA2W", "B00004BZIY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 163731}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.99, "brand": "Lions Gate", "asin": "0784013470", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71YSZMKZKXL._SY300_.gif", "title": "Stir of Echoes"}

Sweet, funny scenes abound, and the combination of innocence and sophistication would have done well in a live-action picture.

{"description": "In Hayao Miyazaki's magicalKiki's Delivery Service, a 13-year-old girl meets the world head on as she spends her first year soloing as an apprentice witch. Kiki (Kirsten Dunst) is still a little green and plenty headstrong, but also resourceful, imaginative, and determined. With her trusty wisp of a cat Jiji (a gently subdued Phil Hartman) by her side she's ready to take on the world, or at least the quaintly European seaside village she's chosen as her new home. Miyazaki's gentle rhythm and meandering narrative capture the easy pulse of real life (even if his subject is a girl flying high upon a broomstick) and charts the everyday struggles and growing pains of his plucky heroine with sensitivity and understanding. Beautifully detailed animation and the rich designs of the picture-postcard seaside town of red-tiled roofs and cobblestone streets only add to the sense of wonder. This charming animated fantasy is a wholesome, life-affirming picture that doesn't speak down to kids or up to adults.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JLET", "6303118240", "B00005JKYF", "B00004T37H", "6302526574", "B00000ICHA", "155890641X", "0788812408", "6300274268", "B00005JLEU", "B000CDGVOE", "0788802194", "B00005JKDQ", "6302320402", "6302642248", "B0006J28BO", "0788803743", "6304089767", "6304100507", "B0001XAPY2", "6304978286", "6301390725", "630273780X", "6303983812", "6304290888", "B0001I55VK", "6304500831", "B000035Z2S", "0788811002", "6302961572", "B002ZTQVHK", "B00005RDVV", "6303929338", "B000CDGVOO", "6303122647", "6303314015", "B00005JKX3", "B00000JS61", "6302158095", "6305319138", "6300274195", "6301757874", "0788810995", "B00003CWPW", "B00003CXBK", "0788812440", "6305009589", "B00004R99N", "B00004REYY", "6305229449", "B000035Z46", "B002ZTQV8Y", "B0045L3SNQ", "B00005BCOU", "B00B1RB942", "B00008AOX7", "6303326781", "0788810448", "6302313937", "6303442447", "0788812548", "B000063V8N", "6305318867", "6303392350", "B00001YX9H", "B00000J2KK", "6304293968", "6305093016", "6304311834", "6305515042", "B00008X5J8", "6303394345", "B000BD18HK", "0788810634", "6303439330", "B0000214F7", "B00000G3AV"], "bought_together": ["B00005JLET", "B00005JKYF"], "also_viewed": ["6303118240", "B00005JKYF", "6301991311", "6302961572", "B00005JLET", "6302320402", "6304500831", "6302787068", "6303314015", "0788812408", "6303929338", "B00004R99N", "B00CSYRHG6", "B000CDGVOE", "6303534422", "0788806270", "6302158095", "B002ZTQVHK", "6304978286", "155890641X", "B000CDGVOO", "6305009589", "B00004R99I", "6302642248", "6304400551", "6303983812", "B00003CXQX", "0788810634", "6300274195", "0790748266", "B00FLIEWJG", "6304290888", "B002ZTQVGQ", "B00003CXBK", "B00000ICHI", "B00003CXHR", "6303394345", "1558906150", "B004CRR9G0", "6304400225", "078881172X", "0788810995", "6304501153", "0788810448", "0788805533", "6303804357", "6300275310", "B006LLY8LY", "0788812440", "0788812807", "B002ZTQV8Y", "0788812181", "B00003CX7L", "6300274268", "0788805843", "B00005K9OB", "6302221684", "B00009YXAW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 193664}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 21.5, "brand": "", "asin": "078881107X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515F75Y02QL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Kiki's Delivery Service [VHS]"}
{"description": "Todd Haynes, ever unpredictable, follows up his experimental trilogyPoisonand his restrainedSafewith this flamboyant study in glam rock through the kaleidoscopic lens ofCitizen Kane. Christian Bale plays Arthur Stuart, a reporter sent to investigate the legend of rock legend and bisexual pop icon Brian Slade (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers as a not-so-thinly veiled David Bowie), who disappeared a decade ago after staging his own mock assassination. But Arthur is flooded with memories of his own adolescence as he interviews Slade's friends and business associates, peeling back the layer of makeup and spangles that was the model of rebellion for a generation of middle-class British kids and discovering a hollow center. Ewan McGregor almost steals the film as the punk pioneer Curt Wild (equal parts Iggy Pop and Kurt Cobain), the genuine article to Slade's calculated, coifed image of glitter stardom.  Haynes's film lacks nothing in capturing the flamboyance and spectacle of the era with flashy filmmaking and kitschy costumes, and if the plot seems lost in the preening and visual fireworks, perhaps that's the point: behind the fa&ccedil;ades and manufactured fronts is nothing but glitter, energy, and a beat.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00000DLV3", "B00005QW5X", "B005TTEFZ8", "B000FO0AD8", "B0002JZT5A", "B00004ZBVO", "B00005UW73", "B000EQHXNW", "B001KEHAEE", "B000RIWAVC", "076782153X", "B00C7T0EPS", "B000255LIY", "B00080ZHD2", "B000GIXLXE", "B0057ZAA6W", "B00BTYXNPK", "B005M2AKJW", "0767819772", "B0079K4WEE", "B00020VZTS", "0783241909", "B0050ODZ6M", "B0006FO8E8", "B007WZTMCI", "B002ZG97O2", "B0013D8L7C", "B000HRMAPE", "B00009MEKN", "B002ZG9800", "B004XNNUZ2", "B004A8ZWV0", "6305499144", "B008N25X7M", "B00GTZWVXE", "B00133KFGW", "B0000A1HQI", "0786883995", "B0013D8LC2", "B007CEFTSA", "B0000648YK", "B00HQVB0Q4", "B000E6ESL2", "B0042RJWTC", "B000MGB6NM", "B00IKM5NJS", "B00005JLQH", "6305428093", "B00005JLHW", "B000E6ESKS", "B00IA7MFEO", "B00005JM2Y", "B000CBCWIK", "B0016MJ6T2", "B000059PQB", "B004MRX8D8", "B0083V2VYG", "1892649462", "B00GHP8SH4", "B0036TGSR6", "B000065V3W", "B00023P4I8", "B0013D8LCW", "B0007Y08QA", "B000KX0IM2", "B00CC2V7AQ", "B004THJ3BC", "B00008YLUX", "B004SIP8WU", "B000089760", "B002DLB1I4", "B002VJVCN2", "B001CC7PLM", "B00E5PHTR8", "B0009A40ES", "B00FRILRW0", "B000F6II1M", "B000P12LWY", "B001QUF3SW", "B000PAAJZ6", "B00996RSYM", "B00FGG60XY", "B006OB3K56", "B00005V5NU", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B00F98FOPE", "B001FBSLPE", "B00GS08Y3Q", "B00CBFB8QC", "B00014NE62", "B008JFX04G", "B0002I84JO", "B004SEUJXM", "B001BMN35K", "B000EHRVOM", "B00005JKJA", "B000E5KURY", "B00BSN0VZW", "B00GSA3K6C"], "bought_together": ["B00005QW5X"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005QW5X", "B00000DLV3", "B000RIWAVC", "B00004ZBVO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 172306}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.39, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "0788815741", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51JW0WJSRRL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Velvet Goldmine"}

{"description": "Do you know anyone who hasn't seen this movie? A box-office smash when released in 1993, this spectacular update of the popular 1960s TV series stars Harrison Ford as a surgeon wrongly accused of the murder of his wife. He escapes from a prison transport bus (in one of the most spectacular stunt-action sequences ever filmed) and embarks on a frantic quest for the true killer's identity, while a tenacious U.S. marshal (Tommy Lee Jones, in an Oscar-winning role) remains hot on his trail. Director Andrew Davis hit the big time with this expert display of polished style and escalating suspense, but it's the antagonistic chemistry between Jones and Ford that keeps this thriller cooking to the very end. In roles that seem custom-fit to their screen personas, the two stars maintain a sharply human focus to the grand-scale manhunt, and the intelligent screenplay never resorts to convenient escapes or narrative shortcuts. Equally effective as a thriller and a character study, this is a Hollywood blockbuster that truly deserves its ongoing popularity.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0790736411", "0767803434", "B00AEBB9UK", "B00008K76W", "B002NZK5R8", "B00AEFXT1S", "B000055Y0Y", "B00008K76V", "B004IK30MI", "B002NZK5UU", "B000CEV3M8", "B0045HCJ8K", "B00AEFXYJA", "B00008K76U", "0783225733", "B0045HCJFS", "B000O77SRC", "B000F8DV1M", "B00AEBB9NM", "B00AEFYXJ0", "B000EGDB10", "0800141601", "B002AT8K9W", "6305428115", "B0006GANOQ", "B00026ZG10", "6304711891", "B003ASLJIQ", "6304806434", "B000P0J0EW", "B00AEFY4CG", "B00AEFYF2K", "B000NTMA0Q", "0783240295", "B002NZK5VO", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00015YVDG", "B00AEBB8YW", "0790732238", "B002GIBVVG", "B00004STDN", "B002AT8KAG", "B00AEFXBG6", "B00AEFXVOI", "B000SFOW8I", "B002VWNICC", "B000U1ZV8K", "B002GHHHP6", "B00009WVSL", "B00008G8M4", "B002AS464Q", "B000PHVZNE", "B003AWRMBA", "0790732149", "B0007IO6NM", "B001ECDVJU", "B00AEBBA2W", "0783226888", "B000QUCRB4", "6305213283", "6304765258", "6304765266", "6305133468", "B00005B6JZ", "B002O3Z50G", "B00000G3PA", "B0043X1FNQ", "B000FO0AA6", "B00003CXGV", "B004AOECXI", "B00096S49Y", "B0014C2FX8", "6305236569", "B003ASLJMW", "B0014Z4OMU", "B000P0J0EM", "0790730979", "B0006N2EZ0", "0783222149", "B001LXIDW2", "0783226942", "B00001ZWUS", "B00AEFY5B6", "B00AEFXX9Q", "B00158K0QU", "B003QO8TOQ", "B00AEFXEGS", "0780618548", "0783235070", "B00004XPPG", "B0045HCJGC", "B000FO0A9W", "B0000AOV4I", "B000YCPUWW", "B00177YA1K", "630471193X", "B007SPPANM", "0792844874", "B00081U7HC"], "bought_together": ["0790736411", "0767803434"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000JYW5BE", "B004LWZW4M", "B000UBMSB8", "B0054OGQM8"]}, "price": 17.75, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 201394}, "asin": "079072961X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514VJP0EEHL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Fugitive"}
{"description": "Stanley Kubrick dissects the nature of violence in this darkly ironic, near-future satire, adapted from Anthony Burgess's novel, complete with \"Nadsat\" slang. Classical music-loving proto-punk Alex (Malcolm McDowell) and his \"Droogs\" spend their nights getting high at the Korova Milkbar before embarking on \"a little of the old ultraviolence,\" such as terrorizing a writer, Mr. Alexander (Patrick Magee), and gang raping his wife (who later dies as a result). After Alex is jailed for bludgeoning the Cat Lady (Miriam Karlin) to death with one of her phallic sculptures, Alex submits to the Ludovico behavior modification technique to earn his freedom; he's conditioned to abhor violence through watching gory movies, and even his adored Beethoven is turned against him. Returned to the world defenseless, Alex becomes the victim of his prior victims, with Mr. Alexander using Beethoven's Ninth to inflict the greatest pain of all. When society sees what the state has done to Alex, however, the politically expedient move is made.", "related": {"also_bought": ["0790734079", "0790705141", "B00004U8PA", "B00000FZCU", "6303953425", "6304484054", "0783235607", "6304039220", "630268644X", "B00006G8O1", "0790700506", "B0002G2B2W", "6305576173", "B000059HCI", "B00008X5J1", "0792837797", "B00000J2KZ", "6300267881", "6301977742", "6300216713", "6300269132", "B00000I1DI", "6302783356", "6300214826", "6305095566", "B00005JLET", "6302054982", "0800103106", "6302201845", "6302798450", "B00000J2L7", "6304994540", "6303686796", "B00005PJ8I", "6300216500", "0783228317", "6303107338", "6304935811", "B00004W5UA", "6302610702", "0783246641", "6300183211", "6302921058", "0792842111", "B00004T37H", "B00002E285", "B00003CXE6", "B000007OY0", "6301971582", "6300184064", "B00005LL26", "0790736039"], "bought_together": ["0790734079", "0790705141"], "also_viewed": ["0393312836", "0790705141", "B0013FSXT6", "B00GGAK0FS", "B008RO875Q", "B004O724M2", "B00004TLMC", "B00023NRSM", "B008M4MB8K", "6305440093", "6303953425", "6303939015", "6303148387", "6303861733", "B00003CXB4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 296220}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.95, "brand": "", "asin": "0790701022", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51EV1DQCCGL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "A Clockwork Orange"}
{"description": "Director William Friedkin was a hot ticket in Hollywood after the success ofThe French Connection, and he turned heads (in more ways than one) when he decided to makeThe Exorcistas his follow-up film. Adapted by William Peter Blatty from hiscontroversial bestseller, this shocking 1973 thriller set an intense and often-copied milestone for screen terror with its unflinching depiction of a young girl (Linda Blair) who is possessed by an evil spirit. Jason Miller and Max von Sydow are perfectly cast as the priests who risk their sanity and their lives to administer the rites of demonic exorcism, and Ellen Burstyn plays Blair's mother, who can only stand by in horror as her daughter's body is wracked by satanic disfiguration. One of the most frightening films ever made,The Exorcistwas mysteriously plagued by troubles during production, and the years have not diminished its capacity to disturb even the most stoical viewers. The film is presented in letterbox format on digital video disc, with a soundtrack that's guaranteed to curdle your blood.

{"description": "Stanley Kubrick'sThe Shiningis less an adaptation of Stephen King's bestselling horror novel than a complete reimagining of it from the inside out. In King's book, the Overlook Hotel is a haunted place that takes possession of its off-season caretaker and provokes him to murderous rage against his wife and young son. Kubrick's movie is an existential Road Runner cartoon (his steadicam scurrying through the hotel's labyrinthine hallways), in which the cavernously empty spaces inside the Overlook mirror the emptiness in the soul of the blocked writer, who's settled in for a long winter's hibernation. As many have pointed out, King's protagonist goes mad, but Kubrick's Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) is Looney Tunes from the moment we meet him--all arching eyebrows and mischievous grin. (Both Nicholson and Shelley Duvall reach new levels of hysteria in their performances, driven to extremes by the director's fanatical demands for take after take after take.)The Shiningis terrifying--but not in the way fans of the novel might expect. When it was redone as a TV miniseries (reportedly because of King's dissatisfaction with the Kubrick film), the famous topiary-animal attack (which was deemed impossible to film in 1980) was there--but the deeper horror was lost. Kubrick'sThe Shininggets under your skin and chills your bones; it stays with you, inhabits you, haunts you. And there's no place to hide...--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300267881", "0790734079", "B00005ATQA", "6302038308", "6300182770", "B0009RRUKW", "0783235607", "0783228317", "B00000J2KZ", "B00004RNAC", "0790736039", "B00023NRSM", "6304508611", "6300182878", "6302921058", "6304509154", "0783216084", "6300214087", "B00004W5UA", "6301427076", "630268644X", "B000003KHS", "B000AMW2TK", "0790700506", "6300181340", "6300214753", "6302054982", "0784011923", "6305363668", "6303686796", "6305095566", "630021639X", "6302822688", "6305576173", "0783246641", "6304994540", "6303953425", "B00004U8PA", "0792158261", "0792100085", "6300213986", "6300189015", "630533577X", "6300214826", "0792846303", "6304288433", "6300147630", "0792842111", "B000007OY0", "0790741512", "6302158176", "0792846311", "6300183416", "0800103106", "B000005PFL", "6300183211", "0790733927", "6301666569", "6301871952", "0767825411", "630339406X", "6303109950", "6300216500", "6300214192", "6300262731", "6303257674", "6304214502", "630018627X", "6300214311", "1558807381", "0792839234", "0767819187", "B00005B238", "0790731975", "6303579388", "B000059HFB", "6302798450", "B00000FZCU", "6303651461", "6303566391", "6302642175", "6301971582", "6300218058", "6301094352", "6300184064", "6300181278", "6304457383", "6300214672", "6300262855", "0800125762", "6303257305"], "bought_together": ["0790734079"], "also_viewed": ["6300147630", "6300182878", "B00005ATQA", "6300189015", "6300267881", "B00023NRSM", "6300213005", "6303953425", "0307743659", "6303148352", "0790734079", "B001AQT0Z4", "6300183211", "0784011923", "B00BBND56G", "0788806270"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 268792}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.0, "brand": "", "asin": "0790705141", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5106FV0S4PL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Shining [VHS]"}
{"description": "The most viscerally frightening and disturbing homicidal-maniac picture sinceThe Silence of the Lambs,Sevenis based on an idea that's both gruesome and ingenious. A serial killer forces each of his victims to die by acting out one of the seven deadly sins. The murder scene is then artfully arranged into a grotesque tableau, a graphic illustration of each mortal vice. From the jittery opening credits to the horrifying (and seemingly inescapable) concluding twist, director David Fincher immerses us in a murky urban twilight where everything seems to be rotting, rusting, or molding; the air is cold and heavy with dread. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt are the detectives who skillfully track down the killer--all the while unaware that he has been closing in on them, as well. Gwyneth Paltrow and Kevin Spacey are also featured, but it is director Fincher and the ominous, overwhelmingly oppressive atmosphere of doom that he creates that are the real stars of the film. It's a terrific date movie--for vampires.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005V9HH", "B0007DFJ0G", "B000M341QE", "0783240295", "B00003CXZ4", "6305313687", "B004SIP8ZM", "B000P0J0EW", "B000LP6KNU", "B000P0J09M", "B000P0J0AG", "B000069HZP", "B004SIP95G", "B0009A40ES", "B0007PALZ2", "B002NZK5RI", "B002AF4Y9G", "B00AEBB89W", "B004SIP7VM", "B00AEFXQ9S", "B00004BZIY", "B003ASLJO0", "B00003CXWV", "B00096S49Y", "B00AEFYF2K", "B004SIP7ZS", "B00AEBB8NI", "B00008975Z", "B002T9H2LA", "B00005JLKN", "B000LC55F2", "0767802519", "B004FQX5B6", "B002VWNIEA", "B004SIP7TE", "B004SIP9Z6", "B00AEFXEGS", "0792846435", "B00003CXSP", "B002VWNICC", "B00AEFXT1S", "B000C20VPA", "B00AEFXESQ", "B000P0J0EM", "B000093FLA", "B002ZG99N6", "B002NZK5VO", "B003LR5BD0", "B002VWNIDG", "B000I2J736", "B0001FR3IQ", "B00AEFYYH6", "B000F5GNX8", "B002ZG980U", "B00005JN0W", "B00005JMJG", "B0000AC8LR", "B003ASLJQI", "B000E5N684", "B002XMGGK6", "B003HKN52U", "B00AP2DC94", "B00001ZWUS", "B000A2UBN4", "B000244GCW", "B000A7DVR2", "B002GHHHN8", "B00004WG2F", "B00AEFXKUI", "B001R3YRG2", "B002NZK5UU", "B00004XPPG", "B0034G4P7G", "B000FKO5QK", "B0009MDPYM", "B000NVT0SO", "B003ASLJQS", "B00005JPD0", "B00005JKWX", "B000YAF4MA", "B00005JKIS", "6305065551", "0783229526", "0783233477", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B002CPMB9O", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00005JA8B", "B00AEFXYJA", "B0000YEEGM", "B007D5E7C2", "B0002V7ON8", "B000N6U0E2", "B00AEFY5B6", "B00AEBB8LA", "6305718954", "B002AT8K9W", "B00AMSLDTM", "B000FS9FCG"], "bought_together": ["B0007DFJ0G", "6305313687"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004LWZW4M", "B00005V9HH", "B0007DFJ0G", "B000P0J0EW"]}, "price": 13.96, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 172718}, "asin": "0790729989", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51VQ890AJML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Seven (Widescreen)"}
{"description": "Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau are reunited in this popular 1993 comedy, in which theOdd Coupleveterans play John and Max (respectively), a pair of elderly bachelors whose lifelong friendship is based on mutual aggravation and constant bickering. Their competitive natures kick into overdrive when the beautiful Ariel (Ann-Margret) moves into their otherwise snowbound Minnesota neighborhood. She takes a liking to John, but after a lover's spat she also gives Max a chance at romance, and the long-time buddies reach a peak of grumpy rivalry. It's a stretch to think that Ann-Margret's dating choices would be limited to a pair of grouchy codgers, but sarcastic attitude and snappy dialogue made this a surprise hit (followed by a 1995 sequel), and Burgess Meredith adds plenty of spice as Lemmon's amorous old father.

{"description": "It's enlightening to view Tim Burton'sMars Attacks!as his twisted satire of the blockbuster filmIndependence Day, which was released earlier the same year, although the movies were in production simultaneously. Burton's eye-popping, schlock tribute to 1950s UFO movies actually plays better on video than it did in theaters. The idea of invading aliens ray gunning the big-name movie stars in the cast is a cleverly subversive one, and the bulb-headed, funny-sounding animated Martians are pretty nifty, but it all seemed to be spread thin on the big screen. On video, however, the movie's kooky humor seems a bit more concentrated.

His investigation is a source of constant aggravation for Miami police lieutenant Lois Einhorn (Sean Young), who turns out to be packing more than a pistol under her skirt.Friendsfans will appreciate the presence of Courtney Cox, who remains admirably straight-faced as the Dolphins' publicist and Ace's would-be girlfriend, but of course it's Carrey who steals the show with shameless abandon.

{"description": "One of the key movies of the 1970s, when exciting, groundbreaking, personal films were still being made in Hollywood, Milos Forman'sOne Flew over the Cuckoo's Nestemphasized the humanistic story at the heart of Ken Kesey's more hallucinogenic novel. Jack Nicholson was born to play the part of Randle Patrick McMurphy, the rebellious inmate of a psychiatric hospital who fights back against the authorities' cold attitudes of institutional superiority, as personified by Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher). It's the classic antiestablishment tale of one man asserting his individuality in the face of a repressive, conformist system--and it works on every level. Forman populates his film with memorably eccentric faces, and gets such freshly detailed and spontaneous work from his ensemble that the picture sometimes feels like a documentary. Unlike a lot of films pitched at the &quot;youth culture&quot; of the 1970s,One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nestreally hasn't dated a bit, because the qualities of human nature that Forman captures--playfulness, courage, inspiration, pride, stubbornness--are universal and timeless. The film swept the Academy Awards for 1976, winning in all the major categories (picture, director, actor, actress, screenplay) for the first time since Frank Capra'sIt Happened One Nightin 1931.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002VWNIDG", "B000RTB0R6", "B006TTC5HC", "B000FVQLQQ", "B000P0J0EW", "0767830555", "B0043X1FL8", "B00003CWQR", "B004SIP7ZS", "B003ELKNH2", "B0006GAOJA", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00AEFXN9G", "0767811100", "0792833287", "B004SIP95G", "B0000YEEGM", "B00079Z9VO", "0451163966", "B00AEFYSWM", "B000P0J09M", "B008MIMWP8", "B000EHQU0S", "B006FE83UE", "B000M341QE", "B00AEFXESQ", "B00002VWE0", "B004SIP8ZM", "B002VWNIAY", "B00009W5CA", "0764586629", "B000ZM1MGE", "B00011CZRE", "B000P0J09C", "B0008ENHUI", "B00005V9HH", "B0019L770A", "B0019L21GA", "B00AEBB9CS", "B0050FXDDQ", "B000CNESTE", "B0006GANN2", "B000LP6KNU", "B000P0J0EM", "B00000IQV7", "B000055Y0X", "B00001ZWUS", "079073219X", "B0019UGYK0", "079284646X", "B00AEBB9F0", "B003ASLJO0", "B000A7DVR2", "B00AEBB9FA", "B0002B15ZG", "B004U7MR3M", "B000YAF4MA", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00066FBQG", "B00005JKIS", "6305144168", "B004SIP7TE", "B002ZG980U", "B00005ATQB", "B0045HCJ94", "0783229526", "B000A3XY5A", "B000093FLA", "B00026ZD04", "B004L9GMBC", "B0000DI87S", "B00006RCO1", "B0007PALZ2", "B0000JBALO", "B004IFYMYI", "B007N31YH0", "B000P0J0D8", "B000H4JH7Q", "B00B0U2SFE", "0792846443", "B007D0FVRM", "B000022TSY", "B0087ZG7UW", "B0002234LS", "B0045HCJ9E", "B0000A02TZ", "B001GD6VTE", "B00AEFYRP0", "0784011710", "B00009AOAZ", "B00005JLSB", "B000Q678OO", "0792838408", "6305882592", "B003LMPKSQ", "B00005MEOU", "B00AEFYSL8", "B0057ZAA6W", "B001AEF6BI", "B000HC2LHG"], "bought_together": ["B002VWNIDG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000P0J0EW", "0451163966", "B006TTC5HC", "B00AEFY0F2"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 40218}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.24, "brand": "WARNER STUDIOS", "asin": "0790732181", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51pJoIlXFbL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"}
{"description": "Twisterwas a mega-million-dollar blockbuster--helmed by a director (Dutchman Jan de Bont) hot off another scorcher hit (Speed)--that flaunted state-of-the-art digital effects and featured a popular leading actress (Helen Hunt) who would win an Academy Award for her next film (As Good As It Gets). But ask anybody who's seen it and they'll tell you who the real star ofTwisteris: the cow. Not to give anything away, but the cow is one of those inspired little touches (like, say, Bronson Pinchot's career-making cameo inBeverly Hills Cop) that adds a touch of personality to a gigantic Hollywood production. The story is blown out the window after an impressive prologue in which Hunt's character, as a little girl, witnesses her daddy being sucked into a tornado. Basically, Hunt and Bill Paxton are thrill-seeking meteorologists chasing twisters in order to study them (and help warn people of them, of course) with a new technology they've developed.

Played glowingly by Cher (Moonstruck), Susan Sarandon (Lorenzo's Oil) and Michelle Pfeiffer (The Age of Innocence), they're lovely enough to tempt even the most jaded netherworld denizen. Soon, wealthy Daryl van Horne (Nicholson) arrives. Is his sudden appearance a coincidence? Or the outcome of the women's unconscious sorcery in this smooth adaptation of John Updyke's novel? Conjure up an evening's entertainment with The Witches of Eastwick. And have a devil of a good time.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00009AOBI", "B003ZD9E2E", "B0000542C7", "B002NZK5V4", "0783225482", "B000EHRVOW", "B000059XTK", "B00DSKSZXI", "B00CLH0APA", "0800177029", "6305428042", "630560097X", "B002ZG976U", "B00026L7PE", "B002GOAH10", "0684809001", "B0001XAQ50", "B00004W4UD", "B0001Z3632", "B001EJW0SG", "B00009V7PJ", "B000021Y7Q", "B001AGXEAG", "B00AEFXYOA", "B00009Y3PV", "B000BC8STM", "0767811100", "6305236569", "B00005JLNZ", "B00AEFY5GQ", "B0000714BP", "B000765IJK", "B002XUBDRY", "B00015YVD6", "B001ECDVKE", "B00DGGIXS6", "079073219X", "B00AEFXPG2", "6305428271", "B000065V3I", "0767810856", "0449912108", "B0001AW14C", "B0000648ZQ", "B001AVMT5M", "B00005JMG8", "B0045HCJGW", "B002JOUNDO", "0767821769", "B00K2SDCLO", "6305428050", "B0071HPOJW", "B000B8QG22", "B000ZM1MG4", "B00007BKVC", "B00AEFY4CG", "B008QE9XD2", "B00009WVSL", "B00AEBB9AA", "078322740X", "B00AEBBA72", "B000065V3H", "B000U1ZV8A", "B00027JZ3E", "B004RA7YGC", "0790740044", "B00081U7HC", "B00005QCVN", "B000083E79", "B000ENC5YW", "B000E6ESI0", "B00AEFXX9Q", "B003HKN52U", "B0000AC8LI", "0859654842", "6305428034", "B000YAF4MA", "B00081912E", "B000U1ZV6W", "6305133468", "B004O26LAI", "1558908846", "B0000AQS2E", "B00AEFXN9G", "B00005AVS9", "B00006FDCD", "B000PMFS2I", "0783222149", "B001LMAK9C", "B001AEF6C2", "B000022TS6", "B00AEBBA2W", "B00005N5SB", "B000V4UFZK", "B0006IIPLM", "B00004TJKK", "B0045HCJIK", "0792833198", "6305212112", "B005FH1RRI"], "bought_together": ["B00009AOBI", "B0000542C7"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002NZK5V4", "0783225482", "B00009AOBI", "B0000542C7"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 88172}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.84, "brand": "WEA", "asin": "0790732262", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51TT7A1CT4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Witches of Eastwick"}
{"description": "In the early spring of 1993, a year before the series was launched, the two-hour movie and series pilotBabylon 5: The Gatheringappeared. This proto-Babylonstaked out the initial territory for the series (some of which would change by the first episode), introducing primary characters and sketching out the alliances and rifts in interplanetary diplomacy. Some of the primary characters bowed out after their initial appearances (Tamlyn Tomita's Lt. Commander Laurel Takashima and Johnny Seka's Dr. Benjamin Kyle never returned; Patricia Tallman's telepath Lyta Alexander made periodic revisits beginning in the second season, eventually rejoining the cast permanently). Set on the first anniversary of theBabylon 5(none of the first four stations survived even a month), the central story involves the attempted assassination of the newly arrived Vorlon, the mysterious Ambassador Kosh, at the hands of (perhaps) Commander Jeffrey Sinclair (Michael O'Hare). Security Chief Michael Garibaldi (Jerry Doyle, a smart-aleck tough guy in the Bruce Willis vein) investigates and uncovers a web of conspirators, a portent of things to come. When TNT picked up the series for the fifth season Straczynski reedited the pilot, weaving back in a dropped subplot while cutting the rest of the film more tightly, tweaking special effects, and commissioning a new score from Christopher Franke. This is the cut released on video, a stronger, more engaging film, but still a broad first stab at characters that would redefine themselves through the course of the show's run.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B00005NTNP"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 531868}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 4.83, "brand": "", "asin": "0790736683", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51JM3XYQ4CL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Babylon 5 - The Gathering (Series Pilot Film) [VHS]"}

{"description": "Peter Cushing delivers his most cold-blooded portrayal of the mad Baron in his fifth turn as Dr.&nbsp;Frankenstein. Abandoning his latest experiment after a drunk stumbles into his secret lab (upsetting a severed head) he hurriedly finds new lodgings with a sweet young thing (Hammer glamour babe Veronica Carlson) whose boyfriend (Simon Ward, in his film debut) works in the local sanitarium. Frankenstein blackmails the lovers into complicity with his latest experiment, resorts to kidnapping and murder for his subjects, turns accomplice Ward into a killer, and even rapes Carlson in a coldly brutal scene. The goriest film of the series kicks off with a flamboyant beheading with a scythe (seen only as a spray of blood across a window) and is full of bloody brain surgery, conveniently offscreen but vividly suggested in the slurping sound effects of surgical saws and drills and the gallons of blood left in their wake. Freddie Jones is heartbreaking as Frankenstein's latest creature, a once-insane scientist who awakens to find himself cured but trapped in a grotesque, alien body. When he attempts to communicate with his wife, half hiding in a dark corner while she peers around and sees only a monster, director Terence Fisher offers the most affecting moment of pathos in the entire series. Cushing and Fisher reunited for one more film together, the seventh and final film in the series,Frankenstein and the Monster from Hell.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302814707", "6305063508"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 538949}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 19.99, "brand": "", "asin": "0790736063", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/517BTRYS8XL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed [VHS]"}

Think of the story as a twist on John Grisham'sThe Firm, with the corporate evil made even more explicit. Reeves is wooden, and therefore doesn't seem to have much of a soul to lose, but he's really just our excuse to meet the devil.

{"description": "Although it was unfortunately ignored during its brief theatrical release, this sumptuously seductive production is that rarest of cinematic breeds, the (barely) respectable guilty pleasure. Combining historical fact with hysterical anachronisms of language and mannerism, it's been tailored for maximum contemporary appeal but maintains a lush, romantic feel for its factual 16th-century tale of Venetian love, lust, and political repression. Catherine McCormack (Mel Gibson's ill-fated bride inBraveheart) delivers a star-making performance as the \"dangerous beauty\" who becomes a skillful courtesan to pursue her forbidden love for a dashing Venetian senator (Rufus Sewell). It's all rather silly in a high-toned fashion, and the film turns dour when the church intervenes with aScarlet Letter-like papal inquest. But the movie's joyously ribald vitality is utterly irresistible, and the casting of McCormack with Jaqueline Bisset (as her mother and courtesan mentor) is a stroke of pure genius.

{"description": "The last film of John Wayne could not have been more fitting, full of details that can't help but make one reflect upon his legacy in the movies and his life as a star. Wayne plays a career gunfighter in the autumn of his life, trying to hang up his pistols after he discovers he's dying of cancer.  Boarding in the house of an attractive widow (Lauren Bacall) and her son (Ron Howard), Wayne's character opts for peace in his final days but is dogged by his reputation when a handful of killers seeks him out for a final fight. Howard is fine as a fatherless boy who needs the strong mentor the hero represents, and James Stewart--who costarred with Wayne in the greatMan Who Shot Liberty Valance--plays the doctor who gives the big man the bad news. Don Siegel (Invasion of the Body Snatchers) thoughtfully directs a very special and sensitive production.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300181588", "0792110188", "0792106989", "630197705X", "6303192254", "6301802330", "0792105907", "6300269884", "6300182452", "0792838556", "6304457278", "B003ASLJRC", "B001E419N8", "0783222955", "0792102320", "6303599052", "6300183041", "6300181715", "6300988473", "6300268799", "6301967488", "6301797922", "0792107128", "630150528X", "0792837967", "6304457316", "6301798090", "6300268470", "6301718275", "6300215733", "6300216233", "6300208281", "B00004RFFA", "0783216084", "0790731975", "6300269175", "6300215865", "0790751305", "6302909023", "B000GX7MMA"], "bought_together": ["6300181588", "6301802330"], "also_viewed": ["6300181588", "6300269884", "0792110188", "6301736362", "6302320496", "6301802330", "6300988473"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 236081}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.45, "brand": "", "asin": "0792108868", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51891KWXHJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Shootist [VHS]"}

Snoopy is foremost in helping to put on an impromptu feast (toast and popcorn) as the gang keeps forgetting the true meaning of the holiday. Also on the disc is a better Thanksgiving venue,The Mayflower Voyages(1988), part of theThis is America, Charlie Brownseries that breathed new life into the franchise.

{"description": "Maybe \"nobody's perfect,\" as one character in this masterpiece suggests. But some movies are perfect, andSome Like It Hotis one of them. In Chicago, during the Prohibition era, two skirt-chasing musicians, Joe and Jerry (Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon), inadvertently witness the St. Valentine's Day Massacre. In order to escape the wrath of gangland chief Spats Colombo (George Raft), the boys, in drag, join an all-woman band headed for Florida. They vie for the attention of the lead singer, Sugar Kane (Marilyn Monroe), a much-disappointed songbird who warbles \"I'm Through with Love\" but remains vulnerable to yet another unreliable saxophone player. (When Curtis courts her without his dress, he adopts the voice of Cary Grant--a spot-on impersonation.) The script by director Billy Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond is beautifully measured; everything works, like a flawless clock. Aspiring screenwriters would be well advised to throw away the how-to books and simply study this film. The bulk of the slapstick is handled by an unhinged Lemmon and the razor-sharp Joe E. Brown, who plays a horny retiree smitten by Jerry's feminine charms. For all the gags, the film is also wonderfully romantic, as Wilder indulges in just the right amounts of moonlight and the lilting melody of \"Park Avenue Fantasy.\"Some Like It Hotis so delightfully fizzy, it's hard to believe the shooting of the film was a headache, with an unhappy Monroe on her worst behavior. The results, however, are sublime.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302484383", "0790743213", "6302484405", "0792839846", "6303402070", "6302484391", "1558807780", "6301586026", "630233683X", "6303444202", "6304039506", "6300267865", "B000059GEE", "6302484421", "0790744759", "6300215814", "B00000F13T", "6304151306", "0792837630", "630150528X", "6301734734", "B0000068ZQ", "6301964012", "630197736X", "6302413435", "B000PYKZYC", "630018627X", "B00004RV8M", "0800100832", "6300183513", "6300181340", "6301963911", "6300246868", "0792840836", "6301798503", "6300251012", "B00000F6O0", "6301967410", "6301965701", "6300215717", "0783221347", "6300269256", "6301978110", "6300216233", "6304056877", "6302909023", "630347327X", "B00005OLY5", "630248443X", "6301797957", "6302305950", "0782008348", "0783235607", "6300215598", "0792840844", "630197705X", "0783235593", "6302801133", "0783236352", "B00005A1VH", "6300181820"], "bought_together": ["0790743213"], "also_viewed": ["6301792769", "B000E39M20", "1558807780", "6303402070", "6305123616", "630233683X", "6302484383", "0783222955"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 258664}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.0, "brand": "", "asin": "0792837096", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51M3WF4F9JL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Some Like It Hot [VHS]"}

{"description": "Truly ridiculous but somehow moving, this right-wing paranoid fantasy by John Milius (The Wind and the Lion) from 1984 concerns a Soviet takeover of the United States and a band of ragtag adolescents who metamorphose into freedom fighters. One can laugh at the notion of Nicaraguans, Cubans, and Russians having worked out a master plan to invade America, but Milius's account of how such a grim day affects a small Western town really does get under one's skin. The cast--most of whom were not yet stars (Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey had probably never heard of a script calledDirty Dancingat the time)--are quite persuasive as nice kids who come to recognize the tragedy of their lost innocence through fierce, uncompromising struggle. Powers Boothe is very good as a pilot who briefly comes to their aid, and Harry Dean Stanton is stirring as a solid working man and father who represents the virtues his sons are fighting for.

Until he discovers cocaine--and then his entire live-beyond-your-means ethos blends with a ravaging addiction that drives his lifestyle strictly down-market.

{"description": "In the year 2018, violence and crime have been totally eliminated from society and given outlet in the brutal blood sport of rollerball, a high-velocity blend of football, hockey, and motor-cross racing sponsored by the multinational corporations that now control the world following the collapse of traditional politics. James Caan plays Jonathan E., the reigning superstar of rollerball, whose corporate controllers fear that Jonathan's popularity has endowed him with too much power. They begin to pressure him according to their own ruthless set of rules, but Jonathan has rules of his own--the rules of a man determined to retain his soul in a world gone mad. As directed by Norman Jewison (who was enjoying a peak of success during the early and mid-1970s),Rollerballcreates a believable society that's been rendered passive and compliant by the homogenization of corporate dictatorships, where the control and flow of information is the only currency of any importance. It's a world in which natural human aggressions have been sublimated and vented through the religious fervor toward rollerball and its players.Rollerballnow looks like one of those 1970s science fiction films (another example beingLogan's Run) that seems a bit dated and quaint, but its ideas are still provocative and fascinating, and the production is visually impressive. The DVD includes full-screen and widescreen versions of the film, audio commentary by director Norman Jewison, a behind-the-scenes featurette, an interactive \"rollergame,\" trivia, and production notes.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0038SUBEG", "B0045HCJKS", "B0013LL2Z2", "B0016I0AJG", "B00003CXTD", "B00004Y87O", "B000P0J0BU", "B000063UR1", "0792838947", "B00008438U", "B0002CHIKG", "B00DX88G16", "B0019BI1DM", "B00000IXPN", "B00AEBB8VK", "6305869103", "0446768391", "B004VT9JMG", "B0050MB5N4", "0792840453", "B001DE29SI", "B001BGS17Q", "B000059HAE", "B0000AOX0F", "B00004TX5G", "B00005V0XF", "B0045HCJSU", "B00AEFY3TA", "B00ESZZOLI", "0783225903", "B003XURDAY", "B00AEFYDM2", "1606730266", "B0038SUBF0", "B00466HNG8", "B000087F6L", "6304936532", "B00AKGG828", "B005FQ2H8W", "B00008974J", "B000MV8ABS", "0790750201", "B000AM6OQ2", "B00JQYV0B4", "B000LC4ZBW", "B00009PY48", "B0045HCJT4", "B000NTMA0G", "B0016LFG56", "B0002Y69V8", "B000FVQLKW", "6305869367", "B000BR9S96", "B00AEFYR3C", "B000063UR5", "B00020X88Y", "B000O78KWE", "0790731932", "B001JAFYFG", "B0040QYROA", "B00005JKFR", "0767802454", "B004KPLVV8", "B0003JAOO0", "B000055Y0X", "B005OT7YF6", "B000XT1P4S", "B000YDOOHI", "B004VT9JLM", "B00I099JO6", "B0002KPHZQ", "B00005N5S5", "B007Y1NNAW", "B004OB2EYQ", "B00005R2IS", "B00000IREA", "B00005ATQB", "B0015NORDW", "B00C3ALLDA", "6305944288", "B00097DY2A", "B000PKG6OE", "B0008191WO", "B000059H85", "6305428158", "B0000DBJ29", "B0000524FE", "B0001I55SS", "B00AEFXR8I", "B000HEWEDK", "B000EHQTZO", "0792839684", "B000KGGIV4", "B00C7A8WZQ", "B000N3SROU", "B0006B2A42", "B00518A70E", "B004GFGUDQ"], "bought_together": ["B0045HCJKS", "B0016I0AJG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00003CXTD", "B0045HCJKS", "B00JAQJMJ0", "0792838947"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 46508}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 25.45, "brand": "CAAN,JAMES", "asin": "0792838300", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51J8WABD9XL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Rollerball"}

{"description": "A stirring example of courage and the indomitable human spirit, for many John Sturges'sThe Great Escapeis both the definitive World War II drama and the nonpareil prison escape movie. Featuring an unequalled ensemble cast in a rivetingly authentic true-life scenario set to Elmer Bernstein's admirable music, this picture is both a template for subsequent action-adventure movies and one of the last glories of Golden Age Hollywood. Reunited with the director who made him a star inThe Magnificent Seven, Steve McQueen gives a career-defining performance as the laconic Hilts, the baseball-loving, motorbike-riding \"Cooler King.\" The rest of the all-male Anglo-American cast--Dickie Attenborough, Donald Pleasance, James Garner, Charles Bronson, David McCallum, James Coburn, and Gordon Jackson--make the most of their meaty roles (though you have to forgive Coburn his Australian accent). Closely based on Paul Brickhill's book, the various escape attempts, scrounging, forging, and ferreting activities are authentically realized thanks also to technical advisor Wally Flood, one of the original tunnel-digging POWs. Sturges orchestrates the climax with total conviction, giving us both high action and very poignant human drama. Without trivializing the grim reality,The Great Escapethrillingly celebrates the heroism of men who never gave up the fight.--Mark Walker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0007TKNM4", "B00004XPPC", "B0008ENHUI", "B00407PNY2", "B000MGTQ7U", "B000059TFW", "B000O78L00", "B000A2WJBQ", "B003PIUII8", "0792839730", "B003ASLJPE", "B000CNESN0", "B0007TKNGA", "B000EHSVS2", "B000EHSVSC", "B00005N5S3", "B00005PJ8S", "B003AWRMCO", "B0009HKH6Q", "B00BLA94IM", "B00AEFYPHA", "B0019UGYK0", "B00AEFY9YY", "B00AEFYBA6", "B00006ADD5", "B0008ENHTY", "B000ASDFHC", "B004R6JG7Q", "0792844017", "B0008ENHTO", "B00001ZWUS", "0790731460", "B00BL9NQ00", "B00AEFXD1O", "B00DDT0JB0", "B001PO556E", "B0049985XW", "B0045HCJ9E", "B00066FBQG", "B007N31YH0", "B000FZETR0", "B0006GANN2", "B00008DDGW", "B00096S4B2", "B0008ENHUS", "B00008PC0Y", "B002VWNIAY", "B003AWRMBA", "B0045HCJTO", "B000062XEX", "B00AEBBA0E", "B004ZRFQCG", "B000MGTQ7K", "B003ASLJRC", "B00CLH0848", "B00005N5S2", "B00441GYYC", "0783226853", "B000O599YO", "B0001AVZBW", "B003AWRMCE", "B004GSVXBW", "B000NTPG6Q", "0393325792", "B00AEFYTEY", "B000FFJYCU", "B0000CBY1C", "B001SV3LL0", "B00005QCVP", "B00079Z9VO", "B00005JN9P", "B00005JKF6", "B003ZEQMH8", "B00008AOTO", "B000O78L0U", "B001DDBD4K", "B000JJSJPK", "0783225733", "B000P0J0EW", "B009YX8MSG", "B0001NBMH6", "B0008ENHV2", "B0006419M8", "B002GHHHP6", "B003INBNOS", "B000CEXEWA", "B000BGR1B4", "B00005LC4D", "B007Y1NR1W", "B0050FXDDQ", "145164261X", "B000O599VC", "B00AEBB9UK", "B000EHSVOG", "B002O3Z4WU", "0767824555", "B004AOECXI", "B00AEBB9NM", "B00008AOTR", "B0013D8M4E"], "bought_together": ["B00004XPPC", "B0007TKNM4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00J4BW0SQ", "B00407PNY2", "B0007TKNM4", "B000059TFW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 1464}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.82, "brand": "Mgm/Ua Studios", "asin": "0792838408", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510N2J46JDL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Great Escape"}
{"description": "Eliot Asinof's detailed bookEight Men Outillustrates how the system of American sports collapsed in 1919, the year the Chicago White Sox threw the World Series. Filmmaker John Sayles worked on his script years before the 1988&nbsp;film (or before he had the rights to make the film) as a labor of love. Sayles's adaptation proves one can make a historically accurate film in the day and age of artistic license. And what a story. Although many know about the \"Black Sox,\" made famous--again--in the 1989 hit filmField of Dreams, the details of the saga are far less known. The center ofDreams, Shoeless Joe Jackson (portrayed correctly by D.B.&nbsp;Sweeney as illiterate and left-handed inEight), is not the core of this film; it's ace pitcher Eddie Cicotte (Sayles favorite David Strathairn), who took the money, and third baseman Buck Weaver (John Cusack), who did not. The film fits nicely into Sayles's (Lone Star) strong suit: the ensemble drama. We are introduced to bickering owners, famous crooks, high-minded judges, lowlife gangsters, investigative reporters (played by Studs Terkel and Sayles himself), and, most of all, players who are at the breaking point when it comes to low salaries and degrading rewards. While some may feel the film is not as visceral as it should be, there is a great amount of verisimilitude when watching finely tuned athletes telling their bodies to play poorly--heartbreak on the nation's diamond. Beautifully detailed (like Sayles's previous labor-drama,Matewan),Eight Men Outgives us powerful lessons in which everyone lost: players, gamblers, and especially the fans who love the game.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005M20M", "6302534372", "0767809262"], "bought_together": ["B00005M20M"], "also_viewed": ["B000003KMM", "B0000399WO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 448268}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.67, "brand": "", "asin": "0792841786", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GD6FM6ZVL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Eight Men Out [VHS]"}

{"description": "Based on Thomas Harris's novel, this terrifying film by Jonathan Demme really only contains a couple of genuinely shocking moments (one involving an autopsy, the other a prison break). The rest of the film is a splatter-free visual and psychological descent into the hell of madness, redeemed astonishingly by an unlikely connection between a monster and a haunted young woman. Anthony Hopkins is extraordinary as the cannibalistic psychiatrist Dr. Hannibal Lecter, virtually entombed in a subterranean prison for the criminally insane. At the behest of the FBI, agent-in-training Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) approaches Lecter, requesting his insights into the identity and methods of a serial killer named Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine). In exchange, Lecter demands the right to penetrate Starling's most painful memories, creating a bizarre but palpable intimacy that liberates them both under separate but equally horrific circumstances. Demme, a filmmaker with a uniquely populist vision (Melvin and Howard,Something Wild), also spent his early years making pulp for Roger Corman (Caged Heat), and he hasn't forgotten the significance of tone, atmosphere, and the unsettling nature of a crudely effective close-up. Much of the film, in fact, consists of actors staring straight into the camera (usually from Clarice's point of view), making every bridge between one set of eyes to another seem terribly dangerous.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005LKIM", "6302054982", "B00008AOS5", "B00005PJ8I", "B000007OY0", "6302800420", "0790705141", "B00003CXE6", "6301179552", "6301427076", "B000003KHS", "6300989003", "6303402348", "B0000633ZP", "B00005ATQA"], "bought_together": ["6302054982"], "also_viewed": ["6305363668", "6302415853", "0792116887", "079213690X", "0800103106", "6305750750"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 331980}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.0, "brand": "", "asin": "0792842111", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4117Q86BS0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Silence of the Lambs [VHS]"}

{"description": "Remember the outfit Cher wore to the Oscars when she won an Academy Award for her performance in this 1987 film? Ay-yi-yi. The actress' more retiring character in this infectious comedy leaps several psychological hurdles just giving her hair a permanent. But then the original screenplay by John Patrick Shanley (Joe Versus the Volcano) is a wonderful, gently satirical tale of an Italian-American family dealing with repression and dissatisfaction against a backdrop of cultural expectations. Cher is focused and funny as a widow who feels she should marry an older fellow (Danny Aiello), but then falls for his black-sheep brother (Nicolas Cage). Olympia Dukakis and Vincent Gardenia are perfect as her parents, and John Mahoney (of TV'sFrasier) has a memorable, small role as a middle-aged man on the make who gets a lecture from Dukakis's character. Shanley's dialogue is comically stylized in a way that makes one appreciate how much words can inform an actor's performance. Taking its cues from him and director Norman Jewison (And Justice for All), the cast immerse themselves in a pool of hilariously operatic emotion.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000542C7", "B000JU8H9C", "B00006FMUW", "B00009AOBI", "630560097X", "B0045HCJ76", "B00000DR7Y", "B00008G7UF", "B000ZM1MG4", "B00C6F61HS", "6305236569", "B000YDBPAM", "B001EJW0SG", "B00DSKSZXI", "B0001AVZA8", "B0000AOV4I", "6304765266", "B002ZG976U", "B001ECDVK4", "0767810856", "B00001W9G0", "B000023VTP", "B000MQC9H4", "0684809001", "0783240171", "B0007QJ1XE", "B000FO0AA6", "B007N31YH0", "6306012419", "B005S9EJ14", "B0000VD02Y", "B002VWNIAY", "B003ASLJK4", "6305213283", "B00DDT0JB0", "B0000DIXDR", "B00079Z9VO", "078322740X", "B00AEFXYOA", "0859654842", "B000BC8STM", "B00DW5ILUG", "B00026L7PE", "B00AEBB8YW", "B00AEFYXJ0", "B00008977F", "B000021Y7Q", "0792844831", "B00000IQW5", "B00009V7PJ", "B00AEFY0F2", "6305133468", "B00005JG6N", "B0001Z3632", "B00004TJKK", "B00005JL3T", "0783229364", "B004SIP6BI", "B00015YVD6", "B002VWNIBI", "B000083E79", "B00004T0PP", "B000VBIGD6", "6305212112", "B007G8SEUM", "B00AEFY4CG", "B0000CDRW2", "B00008NRI7", "B000JYW5B4", "B00AEBB8OC", "6304712936", "B000E6ESI0", "B005ETAM4Q", "B003BV8ICC", "B00066FBQG", "B0001CNRBG", "B00143XE1E", "B000765IJK", "0790742071", "B003LMPKSQ"], "bought_together": ["B00006FMUW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00009AOBI", "B000JU8H9C"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 39509}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 13.46, "brand": "CHER", "asin": "0792838963", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51A3795WX3L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Moonstruck"}

{"description": "Horror master John Carpenter offers up a triple treat withThe  Fog: Jamie Lee Curtis, Adrienne Barbeau, and Janet Leigh all in the same  movie. As if that weren't enough, both John Houseman and Hal Holbrook make  appearances, each clearly enjoying the novelty of being in a horror flick.The Fogopens just before the centennial celebration of the seaside  town of Antonio Bay. Then the witching hour strikes, glowing fog rolls in,  and all hell breaks loose. Carpenter wrote the script with producer Debra  Hill, his collaborator onHalloween, and the two know their craft.  It's a creepy story and a tight script, and, as in their previous effort, the  audience gets to know the main characters a bit before they're put in danger.  The movie also has a sly sense of humor: \"Things seem to happen to me,\" says  slasher vet Jamie Lee. \"I'm bad luck.\" Barbeau is also obviously having a  great time, sinking her teeth into her role as a frightened disc jockey  watching the fog roll in from a lighthouse.The Fogoffers a few  shocks and plenty of good old-fashioned clammy chills.

{"description": "IfBuffy the Vampire Slayerrepresents the lighter side of high school as a macabre experience, here's a movie that asks the burning question, &quot;What happens when angst-ridden teenagers develop supernatural powers?&quot; More to the point, how do four outcast teenaged witches handle their ability to cast wicked spells on the taunting classmates who've nicknamed them &quot;The Bitches of Eastwick&quot;? The answer, of course, is &quot;don't get mad, get even.&quot; That's about all there is to this terminally silly movie, which makes up for its ludicrous plot by letting its young female cast have a field day as they indulge their dark fantasies. Fairuza Balk is enjoyable as the most wicked of the witches, and is therefore the focus of the film's most dazzling special effects. But it's Neve Campbell from television'sParty of Fivewho made this film a modest box-office hit, just before she became her generation's fright-movie favorite inScreamand its popular sequel.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002NZK5V4", "B00441GYVK", "B000FFJYBG", "B000K4WPCC", "6305428042", "078322933X", "B00001PE4D", "B0053TWVQ4", "B002O3Z4VG", "1567184464", "6305428425", "B004P7CN7W", "B004SIP9MY", "B002GOAH10", "B000A5045Q", "B003HKN52U", "B00447L4KA", "B0012GN2XI", "B00094ARJ6", "0783225482", "B000056T5E", "B00003CXMP", "B002XUBDRY", "B00002SSKI", "B00DW5IKYS", "B000BYA5HS", "6305821216", "B001AGXEAG", "B00AEFXO8Q", "B00005J761", "B004LWZW2O", "B005CFBYW6", "B00005JKJS", "B0000524E5", "B00003CWQR", "B000083C6I", "B00AJCUL2G", "B000069I1I", "B000A2X3U2", "B00A2H9L2E", "B0000714BP", "B0009MWEM6", "B00000IQW4", "B004SUDQ1I", "B00027JZ3E", "0767824954", "B000HD1482", "B00005JNY3", "B00AEBBA2W", "B00013RC2K", "1558908315", "B00JPQ1HX4", "B00005RHGK", "B00009WVSL", "B000GCFO0I", "B0016MJ6T2", "B00AEFYM2S", "B00001QGUM", "B00004RF85", "0792840127", "B0021L8UPS", "B00004Z4WR", "B00005JLH0", "0767808673", "B00005K3NR", "B00BSU0FQA", "B0001GF2D8", "B00000F0AD", "0767837398", "B00003CXPS", "B000021Y7E", "B000V4UFZK", "B000BX0VT6", "B002USF1WC", "B004SIP9O2", "6305428271", "B000AM4P9K", "6305065551", "B003VA3JUO", "B0036TGSIK", "B00441GYVA", "B000GYI3B8", "B0041KKYEM", "B00DMDE02Q", "B004SEUJ9Q", "B0000AC8LI", "B000RIWAVW", "B000HC2M0C", "B0001EFV7M", "B00000G3PA", "B007I6JZVE", "B00013RC7K", "B002VWNIDG", "B00AEFXPG2", "B000K7VHLY", "B000FGGE68", "B000H5TH0W", "B00AMEZDJW", "B009AMAGQM", "B0085A9HU6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002NZK5V4", "6305428425", "B00441GYVK", "B00447L4KA"]}, "price": 4.85, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 244555}, "asin": "0800141644", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HC5C2JHDL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Craft"}
{"description": "Director David Lean's masterful 1957 realization of PierreBoulle's novel remains a benchmark for war films, and a deeply absorbing movie by any standard--like most of Lean's canon,The Bridge on the River Kwaiachieves a richness in theme, narrative, and characterization that transcends genre.The story centers on a Japanese prison camp isolated deep in the jungles of Southeast Asia, where the remorseless Colonel Saito (Sessue Hayakawa) has been charged with building a vitally important railway bridge. His clash of wills with a British prisoner, the charismatic Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guinness), escalates into a duel of honor, Nicholson defying his captor's demands to win concessions for his troops. How the two officers reach a compromise, and Nicholson becomes obsessed with building that bridge, provides the story's thematic spine; the parallel movement of a team of commandos dispatched to stop the project, led by a British major (Jack Hawkins) and guided by an American escapee (William Holden), supplies the story's suspense and forward momentum.Shot on location in Sri Lanka,Kwaimoves with a careful, even deliberate pace that survivors of latter-day, high-concept blockbusters might find lulling--Lean doesn't pander to attention deficit disorders with an explosion every 15 minutes. Instead, he guides us toward the intersection of the two plots, accruing remarkable character details through extraordinary performances. Hayakawa's cruel camp commander is gradually revealed as a victim of his own sense of honor, Holden's callow opportunist proves heroic without softening his nihilistic edge, and Guinness (who won a Best Actor Oscar, one of the production's seven wins) disappears as only he can into Nicholson's brittle, duty-driven, delusional psychosis. His final glimpse of self-knowledge remains an astonishing moment--story, character, and image coalescing with explosive impact.Like Lean'sLawrence of Arabia,The Bridge on the River Kwaihas been beautifully restored and released in a highly recommended widescreen version that preserves its original aspect ratio.--Sam Sutherland", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302909023", "6304935811", "6304071876", "0800116917", "630150528X", "6301966317", "B0000040EJ", "6303168507", "0783222955", "6300181472", "0800113055", "0783221347", "6303057225", "6301797906", "0783235593", "6300181340", "6304151306", "6304196954", "6301965760", "B00005Q4GY", "6303494390", "6301977742", "6304291698", "6300988473", "6304117752", "6302797616", "B00007JME0", "630382336X", "0790752395", "B00005A1VH", "6301115430", "6300183513", "6302529441", "B000005PFL", "B00000F13T", "6304765347", "630274721X", "0782008348", "B000059HGY", "6301662954", "6300247031", "630018224X", "6301670140", "0792838408", "6304359675", "6304039522", "6300215601", "6304366078", "6300246965", "6300215539", "6303823351", "0800100832", "6301628454", "6300216721", "630407185X", "6304233639", "6300251152", "6300268748", "0790744589", "0790734060", "B00005Q4GZ", "0792116887", "6301798066", "0790701251", "6301976983", "6301972066", "B00004RFFA", "0800125762", "079212569X", "0792133153", "0790743213", "630442972X", "6301969049", "6300214540", "0783231482", "6300270025", "B00004TYS8", "6300183211", "6301587375", "B00000K3AN", "6300182533", "6301973259", "6304397941", "6301969251", "6300271315", "6303052223", "B00004RGUU", "0783235623", "B000062XM6", "6304458975", "B00004WIDB", "6305237115", "6301965701", "6302415853", "6303029027", "B000005PE7", "B0001DI5W6", "0792837533", "6301662946"], "bought_together": ["6302909023", "6301966317"], "also_viewed": ["0790743213", "6304071876", "B00BBND56G", "B000059HH1", "6305123616", "630233683X", "0783222955", "0783221347", "6304039522", "6300183513", "B000054OW2", "1558803602", "6301662954"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 223097}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.99, "brand": "", "asin": "0800132009", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51PF507DBSL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Bridge on the River Kwai [VHS]"}

{"description": "This strange, 1985 experiment by Ridley Scott (Blade Runner) starred the up-and-coming Tom Cruise in a fairy-tale world of dwarfs and unicorns and demons. After the horn of a unicorn is broken, darkness and winter descend upon the world. Cruise's character, helped along by a magic sprite played by David Bennent (The Tin Drum), descends into hell to save paradise. This movie is almost a classic case of art direction gone amok. The somewhat amorphous Cruise doesn't lend much dramatic focus or artistic definition, but the drama between Tim Curry's satanic majesty and Mia Sara's character, who becomes a sort of princess of the netherworld, is pretty captivating. A mixed experience all around that makes one wish it had been more successful.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00000JPH5", "6303212395", "B00000JPH4", "6300248100", "6303257674", "B00005OLY5", "6304509154", "079073463X", "0790700506", "630196649X", "6300214087", "0792845684", "6300182878", "0790705141", "6304994540", "6302182522", "0800135954"], "bought_together": ["B00000JPH5"], "also_viewed": ["B0000014XE", "B0000687KA", "B00IJUIY60"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 237584}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 10.99, "brand": "", "asin": "1558807381", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31HNRKDKT8L.gif", "title": "Legend [VHS]"}
{"description": "Hit man Martin Q. Blank (John Cusack) is in an awkward situation. Several of them, actually. He's attending his high school reunion on an assignment; he's got a rival hit man (Dan Aykroyd) on his tail; and he's going to have to explain to his old girlfriend (Minnie Driver) why he stood her up on prom night. This amiable black comedy, cowritten by Cusack and directed by Jonathan Demme prot&eacute;g&eacute; George Armitage (Miami Blues), has the feel of Demme'sSomething WildandMarried to the Mob--which is to say its humor is dark and brightly colored at the same time. Cusack and Driver are utterly charming--as is the leading man's sister, Joan, who plays his secretary. (Ms. Cusack received an Oscar nomination for her next role, inIn & Out.) Alan Arkin is also very funny as Martin's psychiatrist.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00003CXGA", "B00009OWJY", "B0015XHQVC", "B004SIP9RO", "B00005JKFA", "B002JOUNE8", "B004YCKKFK", "B000065U1Q", "B00005JPT0", "B000BNX3B4", "B00000IQBW", "B000001FJL", "B00005U5AG", "B00BNH9NCU", "B00008K77D", "B001HVZOB6", "B0013D8LBS", "B000P0I4O4", "B003ASLJQ8", "B000DZ7YN8", "B00AADAK5W", "B004SIP7ZS", "0780618548", "B00003CY5G", "B00014NEZI", "B00008DDXK", "B00AEFXE9U", "B000TJ6PBK", "B002ZG97XI", "B00007AJF8", "0767802519", "B00008EY9G", "6305428239", "6305236569", "B0009X7BDC", "B002FU8IWU", "B007P9HW3M", "B000GGSMC6", "B000065V3H", "B00GHJ1YUI", "B004ZNFTDQ", "B000ELL1SA", "6305428034", "B000093FLA", "B0045HCJFS", "B0015XHQUI", "6304698747", "6305428050", "0783229364", "B00006JDVV", "B000274T94", "B000065V3E", "B00008OE4W", "B000053VB4", "B00016MSV2", "B00005V9I0", "B00005JKBC", "B00AEFYUQQ", "B003ASLJPE", "B009YQJ322", "0767812182", "B0000B1OFL", "B004SIP8LG", "B00008975Z", "B00003CY41", "B0029XFN9Y", "B0049IHX2C", "B00005V4XW", "B00AEFXO8Q", "6305263248", "B00BTYJYOY", "B002AS466O", "0767821513", "6304806434", "B002NZK5R8", "B00AEBB9DW", "B002O3Z4VG", "B0000A02TZ", "B00BTYFWEA", "0792846435", "B004CQZFIU", "B00004XPPB", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B00026ZG10", "B00AG475K8", "B0000A9GHD", "B004WCTLNY", "B002ZG96ZC", "B00DW5IJR6", "B00009Y3PV", "B002WEEYIQ", "B0012KJ0DK", "B0000524E5", "0767817729", "076782153X", "B000PAAJZ6", "B0007IO6NM", "B00AEFXWXI", "B00AG473GE", "B0010YSD8Q"], "bought_together": ["B00003CXGA", "B00005JKFA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00003CXGA", "B000QUU4MI", "B002JOUNE8", "B00005JKFA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 8109}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.99, "brand": "Buena Vista", "asin": "1558908382", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51gX6Vb2znL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Grosse Pointe Blank"}

{"description": "The locked-room murder mystery takes flight in this adaptation of Agatha Christie'snovelDeath in the Clouds. A poison dart gun, aristocratic blackmail, and the  unexpected appearance (and disappearance) of the murder victim's illegitimate daughter add an exotic flavor to a story that is perfectly complemented by David Suchet as the world-famous Belgian detective Hercule Poirot. His European manners and unconventional investigating methods provide a delightful foil to Chief Inspector Japp's straightforward Scotland Yard manner.Death in the Cloudsalso features some of the most lavish scenery of any of thePoirotmysteries: aerial shots of English fields and the white cliffs of Dover, as well as elegant art deco interiors and the increasingly implausible hats worn by the female characters. It all culminates in a classic drawing room \"whodunit\" scene that Suchet handles so masterfully it never descends into clich&eacute;.The DVD transfer contains some minor compression artifacts but on the whole has excellent picture and sound quality. Special features include biographies of David Suchet and Agatha Christie, Poirot trivia questions, a filmography of all the PoirotMystery!episodes, and a link to the official Agatha Christie Web site.--Larisa Lomacky Moore", "related": {"also_bought": ["1569383618", "B000056C0O", "B00005BGSC", "B004WMOSNM", "B00005KH4B", "B005X5XI4C", "0767028627", "B00005RIX1", "B005X5XINI", "B006JY3O2M", "B00GWXHYPI", "B00005QBZL", "B007ISJS0U", "B00AEFYO5I", "B00GWXI16O", "B001V7YZAC", "B000056C0I", "B000065AYI", "B000CRR3EC", "B00005MM5H", "B0028AENVC", "0767020308", "B0000V472G", "B0000V4726", "B00005RIWY", "B0001ZWY76", "B00A27O5AW", "B00005MM5G", "B0006212JK", "B00008YLTK", "B000068QJV", "B000068QOB", "B000068QJU", "B00008G8C1", "B003N2SUKY", "B001RPWUTG", "B00007KK42", "B00005O5CQ"], "bought_together": ["B00005KH4B"], "buy_after_viewing": ["1569383618", "B000TVL2UC", "B0006212JK", "B004WMOSNM"]}, "price": 39.98, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 53426}, "asin": "1569383626", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51QS2PTB61L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Agatha Christie's Poirot: Death in the Clouds"}

{"description": "If you're not a connoisseur of graphic horror and gruesome gore, you'd better steer clear of this wicked 1992 horror-comedy from the demented mind and delirious camera of New Zealand-born writer-director Peter Jackson. However, if nonstop mayhem and extreme violence are your idea of great entertainment, you're sure to appreciate Jackson's gleefully inventive approach to a story that can judiciously be described as sick, twisted, and totally outrageous. The movie's central character is a poor schmuck named Lionel who's practically enslaved to his domineering mother. But when ol' Mum gets bitten by a rare and poisonous rat monkey from Skull Island and is turned into a flesh-eating zombie, Lionel has the unfortunate task of keeping Mama happy while fending off all the other zombies that result from her voracious feeding frenzies. If you've read this far, you'll either be crying out for censorship or eagerly awaiting your first viewing (or second, or third...) of this wildly clever and audaciously uninhibited movie. And while director Jackson would later achieve critical success with his fact-based dramaHeavenly Creatures, his talent is readily evident in this earlier effort. If you find this kind of thing even remotely appealing, considerDead Alivea must-see movie.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00004Z1GI", "B008CYDD7I", "B0002C9DK4", "B00005KH30", "B0001611DI", "B000065FS6", "B005J9ZFQG", "B000F3UA8E", "B000068IEV", "B0024FAG44", "0783227434", "B000WC3864", "B000RPCK2O", "0783228457", "B001D5C1OO", "B00009YXHN", "B000JU7JIW", "B000GIXCL0", "B002VKB0KG", "B00004TJM8", "B000S0GYRU", "B000094J72", "B0002VYOVS", "B0000DC12T", "B0036R92US", "B000T28POC", "B001B187L6", "B00JQYV0B4", "B00000K3TO", "B001BP14MG", "B000068TPD", "B000I2J68M", "B001D5C1R6", "B000096I9V", "B000HXDWRS", "B000FS9FE4", "B0001LQJMQ", "B0002KQNL8", "078322799X", "B00D7AM6M0", "078062856X", "B00125WATQ", "B0001ZX0GK", "B0007WQHI0", "B0000AOX0F", "B002GHHHG0", "B000E1P2EY", "B00JF5GAIW", "B0053TWV46", "B0053TWW9K", "B0013D8LAE", "B000CR76U8", "B001MEJY8W", "B008874968", "B0057O6IMS", "B00005N5RM", "B0053TWW36", "B0009WFEDC", "B002E01MHY", "B000TJ6PB0", "B0009OUBC4", "B000HXDWNM", "6304852444", "B00005K3O4", "B00IF8Q0YE", "B000WC389G", "B00DWG5GIA", "B0002DB5PO", "B003Q6D246", "B000TSIJWY", "B00GGY4R3K", "B00DI012O2", "B000S0GYRK", "B001J710Y8", "B00GHH9IIA", "B005J9ZE5I", "B002EOVXBK", "B0002CHK1S", "B004KDYR20", "B0000A9D19", "B001D262LA", "B000V4UH08", "B000HT38B2", "B0024FADD8", "B000TZJCMS", "B001FOK70S", "B000MV8AC2", "B005OT810I", "B000KRNG54", "B004EI2NP4", "B00KDU8HQQ", "B005CM1IES", "B0000CEB6Y", "B000TZJCN2", "B000RIWAV2", "B002OVO18A", "B001I82RVS", "B002HML6YI", "B001CW7ZWG", "B00005JO16"], "bought_together": ["B00004Z1GI", "B008CYDD7I"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005R24K", "B008CYDD7I", "B0024FADDI", "B000068IEV"]}, "price": 59.9, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 15538}, "asin": "157362408X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZD8DCJAWL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Dead Alive"}
{"description": "Even a man who is pure in heart,And says his prayers by night,May become a wolf when the wolfbane bloomsAnd the autumn moon is bright.If you haven't heard this piece of horror-movie doggerel before, you'll never forget it after seeingThe Wolf Manfor two reasons: it's a spooky piece of rhyme and nearly everybody in the picture recites it at one time or another. Set in a fog-bound studio-built Wales,The Wolf Mantells the doom-laden tale of Lawrence Talbot (Lon Chaney Jr.), who returns to the estate of his wealthy father (Claude Rains). (Yes, Chaney's American, but the movie explains this, awkwardly.) Bitten by a werewolf, Talbot suffers the classic fate of the victims of lycanthropy: at the full moon, he turns into a werewolf, a transformation ingeniously devised by makeup maestro Jack Pierce. Pierce was the man who turned Boris Karloff into the Frankenstein monster, and his werewolf makeup became equally famous, with its canine snout and bushy hairdo--and, of course, seriously sharp dental work.The Wolf Manwas a smash hit, giving Universal Pictures a new monster for their already crowded stable, and Chaney found himself following in the footsteps (or paw prints) of his father, who had essayed a monster or two in the silent era. This is a classy horror outing, with strong atmosphere and a thoughtful script by Curt Siodmak--well, except for the stiff romantic bits between Chaney and Evelyn Ankers.

Of course, it's a quaint curiosity by today's technological standards, but as produced by visual effects pioneer George Pal, this story of Earth's collision with a runaway star is still a dazzling example of screen sci-fi from the '50s, when special effects were entering a new stage of advancement. Despite scientists' warnings about the star's destructive potential, government officials refuse to take action that could cause international panic, but a consortium of private industrialists prepare for the worst by building a gigantic spaceship--an ark for humanity to begin life anew on a distant planet. Who will be chosen to go, and who left behind? As earthquakes roar and massive tidal waves devastate entire cities, the huge rocket prepares for take-off from its miles-long launching ramp--ready to abandon the shattered Earth!

{"description": "More timely now, perhaps, than when it was first released in 1957, Elia Kazan's overheated political melodrama explores the dangerous manipulative power of pop culture. It exposes the underside of Capra-corn populism, as exemplified in the optimistic fable of grassroots punditryMeet John Doe. In Kazan's account, scripted by Budd Schulberg, the common-man pontificator (Andy Griffith) is no Gary Cooper-style aw-shucks paragon. Promoted to national fame as a folksy TV idol by radio producer Patricia Neal, Griffith's Larry \"Lonesome\" Rhodes turns out to be a megalomaniacal rat bastard. The film turns apocalyptic as Rhodes exploits his power to sway the masses, helping to elect a reactionary presidential candidate. The parodies of television commercials and opinion polling were cutting edge in their day (Face in the Crowdwas theNetworkof the Eisenhower era), and there are some startling, near-documentary sequences shot on location in Arkansas. An extraordinary supporting cast (led by Walter Matthau and Lee Remick) helps keep the energy level high, even when the satire turns shrill and unpersuasive in the final reel. There's an interesting parallel in Tim Robbins's snide pseudodocumentaryBob Roberts: both these pictures have almost as much contempt for the lemmings in the audience as for the manipulative monsters who herd them over the cliff.--David Chute", "related": {"also_bought": ["0782008348", "B000006914", "6300269310", "0792837967"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 317638}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.13, "brand": "", "asin": "6300273210", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51F6M66WT0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "A Face in the Crowd [VHS]"}

After Leonard Nimoy scored hits withStar Trek IIIandIV, William Shatner used his contractual clout (and bruised ego) to assume directorial duties on this mission, in which a rebellious Vulcan (Laurence Luckinbill) kidnaps Federation officials in his overzealous quest for the supreme source of creation. That's right, you heard it correctly:Star Trek Vis about a crazy Vulcan's search for God. By the time Kirk, Spock, and their Federation cohorts are taken to the Great Barrier of the galaxy, this journey to \"the final future\" has gone from an embarrassing prologue to an absurd conclusion, with a lot of creaky plotting in between. Of course, die-hard Trekkies will still allow this movie into their video collections; but they'll only watch it when nobody else is looking.

{"description": "Joseph Mankiewicz's moody classic is less ghost story than romantic fantasy, a handsome 1947 drama of impossible love set on the picturesque turn-of-the-century New England coast. Independent young widow Lucy Muir (the luminous Gene Tierney), desperate to escape her uptight in-laws, falls in love with a grand seaside house and moves in, only to discover the cantankerous ghost of the hot-tempered Captain Gregg (a histrionically flamboyant performance by Rex Harrison). Lucy refuses to let the bombastic captain frighten her away, earning his respect, his friendship, and later his love. They team up to turn the captain's salty memoirs into a bestseller, but as his affection grows he fades away, leaving Lucy free to undertake a more worldly suitor, notably a charismatic children's author (George Sanders at his smarmy smoothest) with his own guarded secret. Charles Lang's melancholy black-and-white photography and Bernard Herrmann's haunting score set the tone for this sublime adult drama, and Tierney delivers one of her most understated performances as the resolute Mrs. Muir. Mankiewicz turns this ghost story into a refreshingly mature and down-to-earth romance.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["630266232X", "6302320496", "6302227127", "630150528X", "0767825616", "630197350X", "0792151712", "B00005A1VH", "6303402070", "B00003OSTO", "6303057225", "6300988791", "B00000JKNL", "6301773586", "0783235593", "6301977688", "0783221347", "6301586050", "6301964012", "0780614097", "6300183912", "6305126062", "6301670140", "6301978536", "6301972171", "6303120474", "6301969049", "6303364772", "B0000068Z8", "6301797906", "1558807780", "0783236352", "B000GX4476", "6302130379", "B00000IBME", "B003MG6FJY", "6301628616", "6303209890", "0790743159", "6300181340", "B000CQD1ZS", "B000006FR5", "B00000F13X", "6301797957", "6301986040", "6302464889", "5559477621", "6300267970", "6302800897"], "bought_together": ["6302320496"], "also_viewed": ["6304005490", "0783235593"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 113812}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 10.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6301586042", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HEY8NM3EL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Ghost &amp; Mrs Muir [VHS]"}

{"description": "A tale about a fatherless boy finding dramatically different father figures throughout a remarkable adventure,Treasure Islandis an  entertaining coming-of-age story, with themes of family, loyalty, friendship, trust, and honesty at its core. While Robert Louis Stevenson's classic adventure tale is popular film  fare, it's never been done this well. Charlton Heston stars as Long John Silver and Christian Bale as plucky Jim Hawkins in this TNT production. Directed by Heston's son Fraser (who also directed the excellent family fareAlaska), the film remains faithful to the novel, and draws much of the spirit and excitement of the book. The action scenes are first-rate, and  if the shipHispaniolahas never looked better or more authentic, no surprise: the ship is the original from 1962'sMutiny on the Bounty. The opening scenes are dark and rich, as they capture the period well, with careful attention to makeup (the teeth, the body grime!) and costuming. Oliver Reed and Christopher Lee are frighteningly effective as Capt.&nbsp;Billy Bones and Blind Pew, and the film's first half-hour is theirs. The tone shifts and lightens when Heston appears as the legendary pirate. Look for Pete Postlethwaite, Julian Glover, and Richard Johnson in wonderful supporting roles. The film marks Bale's segue from poignantly promising child actor (Empire of the Sun) to compelling teen (he would later continue to prove his talent as a versatile young actor inLittle WomenandVelvet Goldmine).--N.F.

{"description": "Ranking No. 21 on the American Film Institute's list of the 100 greatest American films, this 1940 classic is a bit dated in its noble sentimentality, but it remains a luminous example of Hollywood classicism from the peerless director of mythic Americana, John Ford. Adapted by Nunnally Johnson from John Steinbeck's classic novel, the film tells a simple story about Oklahoma farmers leaving the depression-era dustbowl for the promised land of California, but it's the story's emotional resonance and theme of human perseverance that makes the movie so richly and timelessly rewarding. It's all about the humble Joad family's cross-country trek to escape the economic devastation of their ruined farmland, beginning when Tom Joad (Henry Fonda) returns from a four-year prison term to discover that his family home is empty. He's reunited with his family just as they're setting out for the westbound journey, and thus begins an odyssey of saddening losses and strengthening hopes. As Ma Joad, Oscar-winner Jane Darwell is the embodiment of one of America's greatest social tragedies and the \"Okie\" spirit of pressing forward against all odds (as she says, \"because we're the people\"). A documentary-styled production for which Ford and cinematographer Gregg Toland demanded painstaking authenticity,The Grapes of Wrathis much more than a classy, old-fashioned history lesson. With dialogue and scenes that rank among the most moving and memorable ever filmed, it's a classic among classics--simply put, one of the finest films ever made.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783222955", "6301797957", "6301976983", "6301964268", "6301562178", "6304935811", "1558807780", "6302656125", "6305081832", "0800132009", "6302360978", "6304119038", "6302226899", "0769403468", "6302091632", "0800113055", "6300181111", "6301976398", "6301586026", "6303393985", "6304039522", "630491010X", "6302816416", "6301802012", "6304071876", "6300268799", "0783235593", "6301966465", "630266232X", "B00005NQGQ", "6302503515", "6303364772", "6300182304", "6301798708", "6301734734", "6303560040", "B000003U12", "B0000068EE", "B00004RGUU", "6304028385", "6300181472", "6300267865", "6301973232", "B000BWIZTU", "6300216039", "B00000FZCU", "6301586042", "6302952581", "6302227127", "630248443X", "6300181340", "0783221347", "6300215962", "6302909023", "6302041090", "6302526167", "0792837916", "B00000F3QZ", "6301661850", "6302130379", "0792107128", "6302700949", "B000007PI4", "6302800897", "6303383009", "0792106989", "6300267970", "6300181154", "B00000F14D", "B00004WZR1", "630280096X", "1558035745", "6300215601", "6300215741", "6300215733", "0792107683", "6303696678", "0792108280", "6305718792"], "bought_together": ["0783222955"], "also_viewed": ["0790743531", "1558807780", "6304539258", "0783216084", "6303402070", "6304429274", "6301976983", "6305123616", "0792839846"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 144842}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.36, "brand": "Studio Classic", "asin": "6301797906", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Z8A6KK0BL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Grapes of Wrath  [VHS]"}

{"description": "A flawed but stylish adaptation of the Chester Gould comic strip by director Warren Beatty, who also stars in the title role. The minimalist plot involves a battalion of baddies who confront the intrepid detective in a series of strung-together vignettes. Al Pacino is a comedic if overblown standout as Big Boy Caprice, and Madonna simply smolders as aggressive blonde bombshell Breathless Mahoney. It matters not that the plot is Spartan, as this dazzling eye candy is much enhanced by Stephen Sondheim's songs, including the Academy Award-winning ditty, \"Sooner or Later (I Always Get My Man).\" Beatty took his cue from the source material and concentrated on the relationships between these people, whether strained, romantic, or hateful. The performances are subtle and more amusing than you would expect from such a visually bold picture. Shot in bright, primary colors, this also won Oscars for Best Art/Set Direction and Makeup (for those inventively hideous criminals).

{"description": "Annie Hallis one of the truest, most bittersweet romances on film. In it, Allen plays a thinly disguised version of himself: Alvy Singer, a successful--if neurotic--television comedian living in Manhattan. Annie (the wholesomely luminous Dianne Keaton) is a Midwestern transplant who dabbles in photography and sings in small clubs. When the two meet, the sparks are immediate--if repressed. Alone in her apartment for the first time, Alvy and Annie navigate a minefield of self-conscious \"is-this-person-someone-I'd-want-to-get-involved-with?\" conversation. As they speak, subtitles flash their unspoken thoughts: the likes of \"I'm not smart enough for him\" and \"I sound like a jerk.\" Despite all their caution, they connect, and we're swept up in the flush of their new romance. Allen's antic sensibility shines here in a series of flashbacks to Alvy's childhood, growing up, quite literally, under a rumbling roller coaster. His boisterous Jewish family's dinner table shares a split screen with the WASP-y Hall's tight-lipped holiday table, one Alvy has joined for the first time. His position as outsider is uncontestable he looks down the table and sizes up Annie's \"Grammy Hall\" as \"a classic Jew-hater.\"The relationship arcs, as does Annie's growing desire for independence. It quickly becomes clear that the two are on separate tracks, as what was once endearing becomes annoying.Annie Hallembraces Allen's central themes--his love affair with New York (and hatred of Los Angeles), how impossible relationships are, and his fear of death. But their balance is just right, the chemistry between Allen's worry-wart Alvy and Keaton's gangly, loopy Annie is one of the screen's best pairings.

{"description": "Fredric March won an Oscar&#xAE; for playing the protagonist (and antagonist) of Robert Louis Stevenson's story.  Dr. Henry Jekyll is an honorable man of science, albeit frustrated at the enforced celibacy of a delayed wedding date. Hyde is the fearsome creature he turns into after drinking a potion, and Hyde's appetites (mostly expressed with Miriam Hopkins's Cockney dance-hall wench) are decidedly unrestrained. March's performance is pretty theatrical, but it's fun to watch; his Hyde twitches and squawks and lopes around like an ape in a tuxedo. Rouben Mamoulian's direction has plenty of the brio of early-thirties Hollywood, and the transformations from Jekyll to Hyde are ingenious for the time. This film followedDraculaandFrankensteininto theaters by a few months, and it stands well with those horror classics--and it's a darn sight more fun (and much more down and dirty) than the 1941 MGM version of Stevenson's tale.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300183092", "6301969316", "6300181278", "6300183084", "6300185281", "6300183629", "6303562248", "6302700949", "6303626424", "6300268748", "6301798503", "6301973313", "6302909023", "6301967968", "6304111363", "6301975987", "0792837096", "6304119038", "6301978536", "6300215482", "6304152450", "0783215096", "6301976193", "6301965620", "6305012792", "B00005Q4GZ", "6301564456", "0790733935", "6301963644", "6301968891", "6302226899", "6302308208", "630290899X", "6300216721", "6303364772", "6301968905", "6302000661", "6303333079"], "also_viewed": ["B0001EYSWQ", "B00F878JW6"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 371826}, "asin": "6301967410", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/215S5HS0NYL.jpg", "title": "Dr Jekyll &amp; Mr Hyde [VHS]"}

{"description": "Lust for Lifeis appropriately titled, for merepassionseems inadequate when describing this superb fictionalized biography (based on Irving Stone's popular novel) of Vincent Van Gogh. In a deservedly Oscar&reg;- nominated performance, Kirk Douglas is physically and emotionally perfect as the tormented Dutch painter, whose life is chronicled from his ill-fated stint as a preacher to Belgian miners in 1878, to his Impressionist-inspired artistic awakening and psychological descent to suicide in 1890. Having triumphed with 1952'sThe Bad and the Beautiful, Douglas, producer John Houseman, and director Vincente Minnelli brought vigor and vitality to this blessed project, which centers on Van Gogh's stormy friendship with fellow artist Gaugin (Oscar-winner Anthony Quinn). Minnelli used an outmoded color film process and innovative camera techniques to vividly recreate Van Gogh's paintings, and he filmed on the actual Dutch and French locations where Van Gogh's mastery flourished. The artist's lust for life also fed his madness, and this film deeply understands the fine line in between.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0452262496", "6301628667", "6301628616", "B000056BRF", "6303037380", "630266232X"], "bought_together": ["0452262496"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 216652}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6301971191", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51YCP9MZK5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Lust for Life [VHS]"}
{"description": "Kevin Costner as a warped serial killer, a pillar of the community whose dark side is embodied by an on-screen William Hurt? You have to admit, it sounds intriguing, right?Mr. Brooksis the vehicle for this unsavory story, and it turns out to be a lot less kicky than it sounds. Mr. Brooks is a Portland, Oregon tycoon and philanthropist whose \"addiction\" to murder is suddenly re-surfacing--with plenty of help from his sneering alter ego, who generally sits in the back of the car, goading Mr. Brooks on. (The other characters can't see William Hurt in all this, of course.) The unbelievably convoluted plot has Mr. Brooks confronted by a blackmailer (comedian Dane Cook) who has a surprising twist on things, and trailed by a cop (Demi Moore) who comes equipped with her own set of professional and marital woes. As if that weren't enough, when Brooks's daughter (Danielle Panabaker) comes home, it becomes clear that some traits run in the family.The scenes with Costner and Hurt are the best stuff in the film, even if director Bruce Evans can't figure out how to play fair visualizing their presence to others. But the script, which among other whoppers make Demi Moore's character a millionaire, is just too unbelievable to stomach. If William Hurt's character provided a running commentary for this movie, there wouldn't be anything left after he got through mocking it.--Robert HortonThe Cast ofMr. BrooksKevin CostnerWilliam HurtDemi MooreDane CookMarg HelgenbergerDanielle PanabakerBeyondMr. BrooksMr. Brookson Blu-RayMr. Brooks: Music From The Motion PictureMore from MGMStills fromMr. Brooks", "related": {"also_bought": ["0767817729", "B0038RSJB4", "B003AWRM9M", "B000R4SMCW", "B002U4UYYQ", "B002NZK5Q4", "B000KF0GWW", "B001ILFUBE", "B00005JKZH", "B00B83ROIE", "0792844874", "B0068FZ0O2", "B002NZK5TQ", "B00JA3RVG4", "B0000TANUI", "B004EPYZP8", "078324021X", "B003UESJEM", "B000CQLZ0Q", "B003L20IG0", "B00005JNP4", "B002AT8KAG", "B00AEFXSLE", "B000FKO5QK", "B00011CZRE", "B00AEBB9NM", "B002GHHHHO", "B002QW7AMG", "B000WMA6R8", "0783233507", "B000OYC7BW", "B0007NFLO0", "B00005J760", "B00006AUJR", "B0006N2EZ0", "B00005Y1UV", "B000F5WR4W", "B0010YSD8Q", "B000GFLKF8", "B002NZK5RI", "B002DU39GW", "B0019EXZY4", "B003ASLJJU", "B002AF4Y9G", "B00HLSW6II", "B004FQX59I", "B00AEBBA2W", "B00005V9HH", "B00AEFXT1S", "B00005JMWP", "B004SIP8ZM", "B004A8ZX28", "B004AOECXI", "B000FFL2G6", "B002QEHPQU", "B00AEBB86A", "B00005JLZN", "B002VWNID6", "B003PIUIIS", "B009HIKAN8", "B000YENUI6", "B0009YA3OA", "B000E5N6LG", "B005NKIPUY", "B000RGN2JI", "B00005JN2Z", "B0006HBZXS", "B00005JLKN", "B004ULNJIU", "B0001FR3IQ", "B003U6SJY0", "B002CPMB9O", "B003Y5H5HO", "B00366BBTO", "B002O3Z4ZW", "B000P0J0EW", "B003ASLJQI", "B000E5KURY", "B00006RCNY", "B00005JPD0", "B002NZK5VO", "B000LP6KNU", "B00AEBB8LA", "6305313687", "B002AT8KD8", "B004BZ5AMI", "B007FQXEXW", "B000EMGICS", "B004SIP95G", "B00AEFXVOI", "B0006J28NC", "B000UGBOT0", "B008E70EES", "B00DU22OI6", "B002ZG99N6", "B000P0J0EM", "B005LAIGLE", "B0000JCFMW", "B002XMGGK6", "B00008CMRK"], "bought_together": ["B000R4SMCW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0767817729", "B00JA3RVG4", "0792844874", "B000KF0GWW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 10765}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.83, "brand": "Mgm/Ua Studios", "asin": "6301971345", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51WP046mMoL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Mr. Brooks"}

{"description": "Now and forever a favorite among kids, this 1990 comedy written by John Hughes (The Breakfast Club) and directed by Chris Columbus (Mrs. Doubtfire) ushered Macaulay Culkin onto the screen as a troubled 8-year-old who doesn't comfortably mesh with his large family. He's forced to grow a little after being accidentally left behind when his folks and siblings fly off to Paris. A good-looking boy, Culkin lights up the screen during several funny sequences, the most famous of which finds him screaming for joy when he realizes he's unsupervised in his own house. A bit wooden with dialogue, the then-little star's voice could grate on the nerves (especially in long, wise-child passages of pure bromide), but he unquestionably carries the film. Billie Bird and John Candy show up as two of the interesting strangers Culkin's character meets. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern are entertainingly cartoonish as thieves, but the ensuing violence once the little hero decides to keep them out of his house is over-the-top.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302765536", "6304932553", "B0000A02WC", "0767825411", "6300214753", "6303314015", "079070546X", "B00000490M", "B0000048S1", "6303049079", "6303506291", "B00000JKNP", "630442972X", "6300269639", "6302824729", "6301570723", "0784011923", "6304117752", "6303442447", "B00005JKDQ", "B0000AQZYM", "6302914469", "B00005B6ND", "6300263673", "6304089767", "0788812408", "6300183181", "6303344224", "B00000JGEI", "6305814694", "6301792734", "0783216084", "0790731436", "6303148352", "6302787068", "6304209266", "6303215734", "630018403X", "6300213668", "B00005LOUS", "B0002F6BQU", "6304500831", "B00006G8LB", "6301969707", "B000641D2Y", "6303269966", "6304030959", "630179513X", "6302705517", "0790742322", "6302794331", "B000059XY5", "078881172X", "6303338690", "155890641X", "6302526574", "6303446590", "6303540082", "6301827732", "6302374189", "6303236863", "0800196767", "6301569385", "B00008X5J8", "6302968143", "6300215814", "B00000JS61", "6301966988", "B00003CX7L", "6304416415", "6302178924", "B000MUANT6", "080013558X", "B0000BWVBD", "B00008DZ83", "6302518393", "B000TJBN6W", "6304118937", "6300183467", "6304291698", "6302453356", "6300214370", "6300214710", "6303168957", "0793941520", "B00000F8J1", "6303109918", "6303929680", "0792133153", "B00023BLXA", "6304093381", "B000005PFL", "B000R3KOWE", "6302409365", "6303347657", "6305537798", "6303212263", "B00000GUNY", "0780623711"], "bought_together": ["6302765536", "6304932553"], "also_viewed": ["0767825411", "6302765536", "6304932553", "0788812408", "B00006CXK5", "6302426200", "6303212379", "6303314015", "6302453356", "B001DDBD5E", "6301404440", "B0007KTBIU", "6301792734", "6304117752", "6302787068", "6302968143", "079070546X", "B000A468XY", "B00003CX8I", "6302526574", "6302320402", "0788805533", "B00003CXI0", "6305940932", "B0000A02WC", "0788805843", "6303148352", "6304500831", "B00005JKDQ", "6305750750", "6304401132", "6304400551", "6302921228", "B00005JL95", "0307142450", "6303315305", "6303442447", "6304501153", "B000009CTR", "0800125789", "0783216084", "6303212395", "0784011923", "6304089767", "6302481805", "B0000AK7AB", "0790700506", "6304873441", "6304143184", "630339406X", "B0000AQZYM", "6305326940", "B000035Z2S", "B0000524CZ", "0788802194", "B00005LOUS", "B00005B238", "6303036813", "6304434340"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 209060}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.87, "brand": "FOX Video", "asin": "6302091632", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GTF7T3ZPL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Home Alone [VHS]"}

However, Cat, has, as they used to say in those days, a mind of her own, and she masterminds a spectacular train heist that puts them all on the lam. Marvin won an Academy Award for his role as the derelict Shelleen, and his performances (he actually has two) are still topnotch and on target.

The writing-directing team of Charles Shyer and Nancy Meyers provides Martin's character with a perhaps too-broad range of comic responsiveness to the situation, some of it gentle (a ritual game of basketball between dad and his little girl) and some of it slapstick (Martin sneaking around his prospective in-laws' house and encountering a guard dog).

{"description": "When two Italian-American boys from New York are falsely accused of murder in a small Alabama town, they call for a lawyer--but the only lawyer they know is their cousin Vinny (Joe Pesci), who made six attempts before he passed his bar exam.My Cousin Vinnyis a classic fish-out-of-water comedy; the flimsy plot about clearing the two boys and solving the murder is just a hook to support a lot of culture-clash humor. Thanks to the strong cast of character actors like Fred Gwynne, Austin Pendleton, and Lane Smith, it's pretty funny--even old-hat jokes about Brooklyn versus Southern accents come to life. Pesci has played a few too many schticky characters, but this time it works. There's just enough humanity in his caricature to make Vinny likable and entertaining. When the movie was released, there was controversy about whether Marisa Tomei, playing Vinny's big-haired and black-leather-wearing fianc&eacute;e, deserved to win the best supporting actress Oscar (she beat out Judy Davis, Joan Plowright, Miranda Richardson, and Vanessa Redgrave); but seeing her performance on its own, it's a comic marvel and worthy of honor.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303101267", "6300989003", "6301569385", "630281622X", "6300247112", "6305576173", "6304994540", "6300213986", "B00000JGEK", "6301666569", "6302054982"], "also_viewed": ["6301398912", "630339406X", "0792116887", "6304233639"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 107990}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6302516986", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51P02PZFZRL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "My Cousin Vinny [VHS]"}
{"description": "William Wharton's autobiographical novel of World War II becomes a  moving portrait of war's madness in the microcosm of a small intelligence patrol on the German front in 1944. The unit, composed of high IQ soldiers, is sent to scout ahead. They discover a small platoon of Germans hiding in the forest, but these soldiers would rather fight with snowballs than guns and exchange Christmas presents instead of mortar fire. The young, rather unsoldierly Americans are offered the opportunity to \"capture\" the Germans without a fight--until a fatal misunderstanding plunges their efforts into tragedy. Director Keith Gordon, who also penned the screenplay, creates an unusually eloquent, offbeat platoon drama shot amidst the tranquil beauty of a snow-covered forest. His excellent cast includes future stars Ethan Hawke and Gary Sinise, with Frank Whaley, Kevin Dillon, Arye Gross, and Peter Berg rounding out the platoon. Though little seen upon its 1992 release, this moving drama received high praise for its vivid characters and delicately wrought imagery and remains one of the most powerful pacifist dramas of the post-war era.--Sean Axmaker", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 270799}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 26.88, "brand": "", "asin": "6302588626", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515XM58H10L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "A Midnight Clear [VHS]"}
{"description": "This black-and-white film adaptation of Tennessee Williams's Southern gothic play is perhaps more famous for the rumored off-screen shenanigans of its stars than for its over-the-top repressed sexuality (only Williams could pull off that paradox, and pull it off he does). Supposedly, stars Katharine Hepburn and Elizabeth Taylor battled for screen time; Hepburn warred very publicly with director Joseph Mankiewicz; and a postaccident Montgomery Clift relied heavily on painkillers and support from friend Taylor during the grueling shoot. Even this, however, cannot top the events of the film itself, revolving around the unseen playboy Sebastian and his mysterious death, which has something to do with young boys, a decadent European vacation, and Taylor in a provocative wet, white bathing suit. To give away the plot would spoil the fun, but suffice it to say that what Taylor saw was so horrible it drove her nuts, and Sebastian's mother (Hepburn) wants her to have a lobotomy in order to keep it from coming out; Clift is brought in to do the procedure. It's all a hoot and a holler, but as played by the two leading ladies (both of whom nabbed Oscar nominations), it's also compelling, chilling, and utterly gothic. Taylor gives a fierce performance, as the climaxing monologue that reveals Sebastian's \"secret\" rests entirely on her shoulders, and Hepburn plays brilliantly against type as Sebastian's manipulating, overbearing mother. Only Clift, saddled with a dreary character in charge of plot exposition, fails to deliver.

The cop is a romantic hiding under a hard-boiled exterior who falls in love with the beautiful victim through the portrait that hangs in her apartment. Gene Tierney, whose heart-shaped face mixes the exotic with the girl next door, brings the poise and calm of a model to her role as the object of every man's gaze and the target of a killer.Laura, handsomely shot in dreamy black and white, is the first and best of Otto Preminger's cool, controlled murder mysteries. In the gritty world of film noir it remains the most refined and elegant example of the genre, but under the tasteful decor and high-society fashions lies a world seething in jealousy, passion, blackmail, and murder. Vincent Price costars as a blithe gigolo and David Raksin's lush theme has become a wistful romantic standard.--Sean Axmaker", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 231608}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "title": "Laura [VHS]", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303364772", "6301973410", "6301586042", "6302732964", "B0000040EO", "6301969316", "6302413435", "6304056915", "6301670140", "6300183890", "6300183513", "B0000068EE", "B00003OSTO", "6301797957", "6301798503", "6300215741", "0792840836", "B0000048YO", "6301976932", "6300215644", "6301586050", "6304039530", "6302226899", "B000E6ESWG", "0782006779", "6301670159", "6302413451", "0790743531", "B001ARDBXU", "0783215096", "6301586026", "6301964012", "6301971647", "6300183912", "6302800897", "630197879X", "0792107683", "6302224411", "6303120504", "B00004TX24", "6301967070", "B000BWIZRW", "6300181111", "1558807780", "6304056869", "B006P0UQ2G", "6302842263", "6300251152", "6302806348", "079284517X", "0800113055", "6303560067", "6300216721", "6301978536", "0792840844", "6301973380", "0783236352", "6302363292", "6301978315", "6304119097", "6301978706", "6304383169", "B000021Y6M", "6303957013", "6300181278", "6302305950", "B00000JKNL", "0800100832", "0783221347", "6301797906", "078200847X", "0783217390", "6302278929", "6302120535", "6302450179", "6303333079", "6301973089", "6301975987", "6305012792", "B00000F3UB", "6301967682", "0790743213", "6301798759", "6301661826", "6301628454", "630196912X", "B000006N70", "1558804226", "B000021Y6K", "6300208133", "6301965620", "6302787033", "6301578805", "6301491920", "0792837649", "6304359705", "6301969081", "6303364748", "6302360978", "6302309751"], "also_viewed": ["B000083C6R", "B002GSXKQA", "B0086IMNRQ", "6300207919", "6301969316", "B002VWNIAY", "6300183513", "0792839846"]}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GSB8Q42DL._SY300_.jpg", "asin": "630266232X"}

{"description": "EDITOR'S NOTE: According to a Warner Home Video technician involved in  the production ofThe Stanley Kubrick Collection, Kubrick authorized all aspects of theCollection, from the use of Digital Component Video (or \"D-1\") masters originally approved in 1989, to the use of minimalist screen menus, chapter stops, and (in the case of2001: A Space OdysseyandThe Shiningon DVD) supplementary materials. Full-screen presentation ofThe ShiningandFull Metal Jacketwas also approved by Kubrick, who recomposed his original framing,  reportedly believing that those films looked best on video in the full-screen format. (In fact, the original theatrical aspect ratio ofThe Shiningwas 1.66:1, meaning that a relatively small portion of the image is lost.)

{"description": "When you've got Charles Laughton and Bela Lugosi, how can you go wrong? Shipwreck victim Edward Parker (Richard Arlen) is stranded on an island run by the mysterious Dr.&nbsp;Moreau (Laughton). Moreau is hospitable enough, but the jungle is full of menacing shapes--and what about those ominous references to the House of Pain? Parker gradually learns of Moreau's unholy experiments and worries that he'll never escape. Though it has aged a bit,Island of Lost Soulsis surprisingly spine-tingling, particularly the horrifying climax. Light and shadows are used especially well--occasionally, Moreau speaks with his face entirely hidden, except for his glittering eyes. Laughton turns in yet another superbly evil performance and even the somewhat worse-for-wear Lugosi is creepy as the pronouncer of the law. (\"Are we not men?\" Well, no, not exactly.) This is a nicely chilling classic that may even make you think twice about modern science's experimentation with genetics. Don't miss it.

{"description": "First off, be advised that theMonolith Monstersare not really monsters in the conventional sense (meaning a guy in a hideous rubber suit wreaking havoc).  That having been said, this is still a very effective, standout Fifties sci-fi film.  A meteor crashes near a desert town, and the fragments of the meteor crystallize very quickly when exposed to water.  They also suck the moisture from humans, turning them stiff as boards.  The rocks (black and shiny, like obsidian) grow to great heights and fall over from their own weight, with each shard of the rock starting the process over again.   Of course, a thunderstorm accelerates everything.  It's up to the townspeople to stop the advance of the menace before it overruns everything.  Based on a story by Jack Arnold (director ofCreature from the Black Lagoon),Monolith's production values are very good for the time, with the huge, menacing black rocks  sometimes resembling the Chrysler Building. There are plenty of recognizable character actors to be seen, and a sense of pacing and tension that's above average for the genre.

{"description": "Woody Allen combined the best parts of his earlier films in creating HANNAH AND HER SISTERS, his 1986 masterwork about the changing relationships among three sisters living in New York City. Hannah (Mia Farrow) has put her acting career aside in order to take care of her family with second husband Elliot (Michael Caine in an Oscar-winning performance). Elliot has fallen in love with Hannah's sister Lee (Barbara Hershey), who herself is feeling suffocated by her cynical, mean-spirited loner of a lover, played with great intensity by Ingmar Bergman regular Max von Sydow. Meanwhile, third sister Holly (Oscar winnner Dianne Wiest) is struggling to find her own voice, working as a caterer while she tries to get her own acting career going. And in the middle of everything is Mickey (Woody Allen at his most neurotic), a television writer who is divorced from Hannah, has dated Holly, and, when he suspects he might have a brain tumor, decides to re-evaluate his life and his faith in God. HANNAH AND HER SISTERS is Allen's most fully realized, optimistic adult comedy. He won a well-deserved Oscar for his marvelous screenplay, filled with his trademark sharp, witty dialogue, his undying passion for New York (its culture, architecture, music, romance), and some of his most well-developed characters.

The story concerns two girls, outcasts who become best friends, whose bizarre fantasy life becomes more intense as their bond becomes increasingly more obsessive. When the mother of one of the girls tries to intervene and split the girls apart, they kill her and stand trial for murder in what is to this day still a celebrated and controversial case. Kate Winslet (Titanic) and Melanie Lynskey create two sympathetic and yet uncomfortably eerie characters in riveting portrayals. Featuring some startling and unique moments of visual brilliance as well as a disturbing love story between the two girls,Heavenly Creaturesis at once both unsettling and beautiful to behold.--Robert Lane", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 465556}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.88, "brand": "", "asin": "6303433766", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71GJ4TYE7ZL._SY300_.gif", "title": "Heavenly Creatures [VHS]"}

{"description": "Ever since this convoluted thriller dazzled audiences and critics in 1995 and won an Oscar for Christopher McQuarrie's twisting screenplay,The Usual Suspectshas continued to divide movie lovers into opposite camps. While a lot of people take great pleasure from the movie's now-famous central mystery (namely, \"Who is Keyser S&ouml;ze?\"), others aren't so easily impressed by a movie that's too enamored of its own cleverness to make much sense. After all, what are we to make of a final scene that renders the entire movie obsolete? Half the fun ofThe Usual Suspectsis the debate it provokes and the sheer pleasure of watching its dynamic cast in action, led (or should we say, mislead) by Oscar-winner Kevin Spacey as the club-footed con man who recounts the saga of enigmatic Hungarian mobster Keyser S&ouml;ze. Spacey's in a band of thieves that includes Gabriel Byrne, Stephen Baldwin, Kevin Pollak, and Benicio Del Toro, all gathered in a plot to steal a large shipment of cocaine. The story is told in flashback as a twisted plot being described by Spacey's character to an investigating detective (Chazz Palmintieri), andThe Usual Suspectsis enjoyable for the way it keeps the viewer guessing right up to its surprise ending. Whether that ending will enhance or extinguish the pleasure is up to each viewer to decide. Even if it ultimately makes little or no sense at all, this is a funny and fiendish thriller, guaranteed to entertain even its vocal detractors.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0800125762", "0800125789", "6302935148", "0783222955", "B00005QATY", "B00003CWL5", "6304259131", "6300215741"], "also_viewed": ["6304140851"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 469637}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.0, "brand": "", "asin": "6303908306", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Z2K7HPEJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Usual Suspects, Letterbox Edition  [VHS]"}

{"description": "Based on a true case that scandalized Canada, this film takes place in two halves. The first, set in the mid-1970s, deals with a Catholic orphanage, run by Brother Lavin (Henry Czerny), who doesn't have the boys' best interest at heart. Rather, he uses them to fuel his own sick sexual desires, becoming a predator in a priest's collar, making an indelible mark on 10-year-old boys. And he's not the only one (just the most vicious). Cut to 1990: One of the now-grown boys comes forward to accuse Lavin and face him in court. But Lavin is now married and the father of two boys--and the church continues to deny that any impropriety occurred. This is strong stuff, with the emotional pain almost harder to take than the shadowy scenes of sexual abuse--but the latter are upsetting as well.

{"description": "Some people may sneer at this 1965 musical, but the truth is the film has earned its status as a perennially watchable romantic-drama, largely on the strength of a fun story and chemistry between stars Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer. Veteran filmmaker Robert Wise (The Day the Earth Stood Still) mostly stays out of the way of the film's appealing elements, which include a based-on-fact tale of Austria's von Trapp family, who fled their Nazi-occupied country in 1938. Andrews is delightful and even fascinating as Maria, who sheds her tomboyish ways as a novice nun to accept the mantle of adulthood, becoming matron of the motherless von Trapp clan. Plummer is matinee-idol handsome and gives a smart performance to boot, and the cast of young people and kids who make up the singing von Trapp children make a strong impression. Based on the Rodgers and Hammerstein stage musical, the score includes such winners as \"Maria\" and the future John Coltrane hit \"My Favorite Things.\"--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["6304400551", "6304178352", "6305123616", "B00000JS61", "6305282927", "B00000F6D1", "630233683X", "6304151306", "6302526574", "6303494390", "0792839846", "0792839129", "155890641X", "6303215734", "0788802194", "0788812807", "6301390725", "6303314015", "0788812408", "630150528X", "0790744759", "6303444202", "6300263673", "6302787068", "6304401132", "6302320402", "0788805533", "B00004TRD5", "6300246787", "6303854311", "B000056BRF", "0788805843", "0792151712", "B0041GWWUK", "6304500831", "6302091632", "6303168507", "630197736X", "6301586026", "6300207919", "6302642248", "6300215695", "0788806270", "B00005LL26", "B0000048YM", "6304089767", "5559477621", "6300275310", "6305229449", "6302178924", "6300277089", "6305750750", "6304331851", "6302936381", "B00000JKNP", "6300181111", "B0000AQZYM", "6300215814", "6300215830", "6300274195", "B002M2Z3BA", "6300213668", "B000035Z2S", "0788803743", "B00000491O", "B00000I1EM", "B00005RRG3", "B002HK9IDQ", "6301796535", "6305940932", "0783222955", "6303315305", "6302271991", "6301966317", "B00004RV8M", "0792840836", "6304100507", "6301972279", "0792837614", "6304546262", "B00005RRG5", "6303929338", "6302150620", "6300182304", "6305326940", "078881172X", "B0000E32WB", "6302816246", "6300215741", "6301792734", "B0000633ZP", "0800132009", "B00005RRG6", "B0002F6BQU", "B000059HH1", "6305177473", "B0000VCZKM", "6301971531", "0792839749"], "bought_together": ["6304400551"], "also_viewed": ["6304400551", "6304178352", "6303314015", "6305123616", "155890641X", "0788812408", "B00000JS61", "0788802194", "6302526574", "6302642248", "0792839129", "6305282927", "B00000F6D1", "078881172X", "6304500831", "6300274268", "6302158095", "6303215734", "B000035Z2S", "6304151306", "6304143184", "0792151712", "0788805843", "6304401132", "6302787068", "6300213668", "0788806270", "6301969707", "630233683X", "6305326940", "0792839846", "6305750750", "B00005LL26", "6302178924", "6304978286", "5559477621", "6303036813", "6303494390", "B00000JKNP", "6304539258", "6304873441", "6301792769", "6304290888", "6304718551", "B0041GWWUK", "B000003KHS", "6304089767", "6303929338", "6302091632", "6302961572", "B0007KTBIU", "6300263673", "6303675212", "6301752627", "6301792734", "B00FWMVVLS", "0783229011", "6304539274", "B00004TRD5"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 84952}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.94, "brand": "", "asin": "6304117752", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51AESVTB4DL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Sound of Music [VHS]"}

{"description": "Dick Powell will forever be known as a 1930s crooner in archetypal musical comedies, but this career-changing role shows Powell at his best and remains perhaps the most faithful cinematic representation of Raymond Chandler's hard-boiled hero, Philip Marlowe, ever put on screen. In this adaptation ofFarewell, My Lovely, Powell's cynical, smart-talking private eye is hired by a dim ex-con (pug-nosed Mike Mazurki) to find his girl Velma, and by the prissy stooge of a blackmail victim to babysit him during a handoff. The meeting ends with the stooge's death, and Marlowe is immediately engaged by the owner of some jewels, the wily Mrs. Grayle (Claire Trevor), to recover them. As Marlowe navigates the dark, dangerous world of wartime L.A., splitting his search between high-society haunts and the cheap, smoky bars and flophouses of the inner city, he turns up one too many stones, winds up on the wrong end of a fist, and wakes up to a drug-induced nightmare that director Edward Dmytryk delivers with a mixture of surreal symbolism and sinister expressionism. Powell delivers screenwriter John Paxton's snappy lines and droll asides with hard-boiled cynicism, like someone not quite as tough as he talks; but it's Powell's innate vulnerability that makes this reluctant saint of the city so compelling. Dmytryk's shadowy style creates a visual equivalent to the web of intrigue Marlowe navigates, an almost perpetual world of night. One of the first greatfilms noirand an often-overlooked detective-movie classic.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301491920", "B00005RDRL", "6302121620", "B000BWIZRW", "6302801133", "0783217528", "630196697X", "6300185206"], "bought_together": ["6301491920"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 365132}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6304212135", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51J45D72NEL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Murder My Sweet [VHS]"}
{"description": "A flashy, splashy summer-movie blockbuster that's fun and exciting without being mindless? That's the impossible mission accomplished by director Brian De Palma, star-coproducer Tom Cruise, and the crack team ofMission: Impossible. Based on the '60s TV show and an almost impenetrably complex (but nonetheless thrilling) original story by David Koepp (Jurassic Park) and Steven Zaillian (Schindler's List), with a screenplay by Koepp and Robert Towne (Chinatown,Shampoo),Mission: Impossiblebegins with veteran agent Jim Phelps (Jon Voight) and his expert crew embarking on a mission that goes horribly, horribly wrong. But nothing is what it seems. The nail-biting set piece--always a signature of director De Palma (Carrie,The Untouchables)--in which Cruise is lowered from the ceiling to retrieve information from a computer in a high-security vault--is an instant classic. But perhaps even more impressive, at least in retrospect, is a flashback sequence in which two characters attempt to reconstruct a series of events from multiple points of view. It's pretty daring and sophisticated stuff for a big-budget spy movie, but brains were always what put theMission: Impossibleteam ahead of the competition, anyway, no?--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B00FZM412Q", "B0044VB3CK", "B00016UX0K", "B005XUNG5I"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 370174}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.99, "brand": "", "asin": "630420065X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41CTTDNC5EL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Mission Impossible [VHS]"}

{"description": "After Martin Scorsese went to Hollywood in 1972 to direct the low-budgetBoxcar Berthafor B-movie mogul Roger Corman, the young director showed the film to maverick director John Cassavetes and got an instant earful of urgent advice. \"It's crap,\" said Cassavetes in no uncertain terms, \"now go out and make something that comes from your heart.\" Scorsese took the advice and focused his energy onMean Streets, a riveting contemporary film about low-life gangsters in New York's Little Italy that critic Pauline Kael would later call \"a true original, and a triumph of personal filmmaking.\" Starring Robert De Niro and Harvey Keitel in roles that announced their talent to the world, it set the stage for Scorsese's emergence as one of the greatest American filmmakers. Introducing themes and character types that Scorsese would return to inTaxi Driver,GoodFellas,Casino, and other films, the loosely structured story is drawn directly from Scorsese's background in the Italian neighborhoods of New York, and it seethes with the raw vitality of a filmmaker who has found his creative groove. As the irresponsible and reckless Johnny Boy, De Niro offers striking contrast to Keitel's Charlie, who struggles to reconcile gang life with Catholic guilt. More of an episodic portrait than a plot-driven crime story,Mean Streetsremains one of Scorsese's most direct and fascinating films--a masterful calling card for a director whose greatness was clearly apparent from that point forward.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0790733927", "6302842263", "630026887X", "B000005PPB", "6302816629", "6301564456"], "also_viewed": ["6302066891", "6303534368"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 426972}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6304457375", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51CA63GNNXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Mean Streets [VHS]"}
{"description": "A grandly entertaining, old-fashioned adventure based on the Rudyard Kipling short story,The Man Who Would Be Kingis the kind of rousing epic about which people said, even in 1975, &quot;Wow! They don't make 'em like that anymore!&quot; When director John Huston (The Maltese Falcon,The Treasure of the Sierra Madre,The African Queen) first started trying to make the film, with Gable and Bogart, the project was derailed by the latter's death. It was a few decades before Huston was able to finally realize his dream movie--and with an unimprovable cast. Sean Connery and Michael Caine are, respectively, Daniel Dravot and Peachy Carnahan, a pair of lovably roguish British soldiers who set out to make their fortunes by conning the priests of remote Kafiristan into making them kings. It's a rollicking tale, an epic satire of imperialism, and the good-natured repartee shared by Caine and Connery is pure gold. In today's screen adventures, humor is usually imposed on the material by a writer or director trying to make some kind of cleverly self-aware comment (&quot;Hey, we know it's a movie!&quot;), but that sort of jokiness can create so much ironic distance that it pushes the audience right out of the picture.

{"description": "This science fiction blockbuster from 1990 began its production life as a very different movie than the one that was released. An adaptation of the Philip K. Dick short story &quot;We Can Remember It for You Wholesale,&quot;Total Recallwas originally conceived of with Richard Dreyfuss starring as a Walter Mitty-like character who experiences a variety of artificially induced fantasies. The movie we know is a mega-budget action epic set on Mars.  Arnold Schwarzenegger plays a normal working man who discovers that his entire reality has been invented to conceal a plot of planetary domination. Oscar-winning special effects and violent action propel the twisting plot, in which Arnold manipulates his manipulators in a world of dazzling high technology. Director Paul Verhoeven (Robocop) indulges his usual penchant for gratuitous bloodshed, but the movie has enough cleverness to rise above its excesses.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AKGG828", "B000RW3VCK", "B00005N5S5", "B000056PMU", "B000BPL2FQ", "B00026ZG10", "1558908846", "B0002J58HO", "B00005JA8B", "B001VLBDD0", "B002GHHHME", "B005LAII3A", "B0045HCJGC", "B0000VD12I", "6305767866", "B00HZMZ2FE", "B000FC2FQA", "B000RJO56E", "B001TK80C0", "0783225504", "B0001Z37HM", "B00004Y87O", "B00005N7Z1", "B00005JKIP", "B005COLETU", "0783241895", "B00013RC8E", "B00007AJG4", "0783226926", "B00AEFYDM2", "B001FB55HQ", "0800195175", "B003XURDAY", "B00004XMSC", "B000OVLBHG", "B00IZZDWKM", "B0045HCJ5S", "B000U1ZV8K", "B009YQJ322", "B0002CHK1S", "6304602944", "B00004STDN", "B002ZG98LO", "0783225946", "B0006GANOQ", "B0045HCJT4", "B00005JL78", "B000QUCQX8", "B00008G8LY", "B00005JMZK", "B001B3LIOC", "B0004Z33EG", "B00I9TDMRM", "B0002S94CK", "B000U1ZV62", "B00005JN0T", "B0045HCJG2", "B0000542CD", "B000U1ZV4Y", "B000E5N684", "B0000VCZK2", "B0000844I8", "B00008G8M4", "B004P7CN5O", "B0004Z33EQ", "B00006RCOC", "B000O77SRC", "6304806434", "B000RRS7RE", "B002ZG999U", "B00000G3PA", "B004P3HA8I", "B000QUCRB4", "B00003CWU3", "B00BLF9FOK", "B002VWNIDG", "B005LAIHXQ", "B00005JKFR", "B0009X768W", "B000GUJYQ0", "B000FI8MPW", "B0045HCJFS", "B001OST0M6", "B00AEBB99Q", "B002UZCJ8Y", "B000P0J0AQ", "6305258287", "B000NTMA0Q", "B00005JNTI", "B002VWNID6", "B00005JM5B", "B008JFUO36", "6304711891", "B000O77SRM", "B000QXDCLU", "B00008G8M5", "B00000ILDD", "B0000AOX0F", "0780622650", "B0007PALZ2"], "bought_together": ["B00026ZG10"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005LAII3A", "B00005JA8B", "B001JFZ118", "B001VLBDD0"]}, "price": 19.0, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 88004}, "asin": "6304490135", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51D88Q82WTL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Total Recall"}
{"description": "Dashing Errol Flynn is the definitive Robin Hood in the most gloriously swashbuckling version of the legendary story. Warner Brothers reunited Michael Curtiz, their top-action director, with the winning team of Flynn and Olivia de Havilland (Maid Marian) and perennial villain Basil Rathbone as the aristocratic Sir Guy of Gisbourne, and pulled out all stops for the production. It became their costliest film to date, a grandly handsome, glowing Technicolor adventure set to a stirring,Oscar-winning scoreby Erich Wolfgang Korngold. The decadent Prince John (a smoothly conniving Claude Rains) takes advantage of King Richard's absence to tax the country into poverty but meets his match in the medieval guerrilla rebel Robin Hood and his Merry Men of Sherwood Forest, who rise up and, to quote a clich&eacute; coined by the film, \"steal from the rich and give to the poor.\" Stocky Alan Hale Sr. plays Robin's loyal friend Little John (a part he played in Douglas Fairbanks's silent version), Eugene Palette the portly Friar Tuck, and Melville Cooper the bumbling Sheriff of Nottingham. Flynn's confidence and cocky charm makes for a perfect Robin Hood, and his easygoing manner is a marvelous counterpoint to Rathbone's regal bearing and courtly diction. The film climaxes in their rousing battle-to-the-finish sword fight, a magnificently choreographed scene highlighted by Curtiz's inventive use of shadows cast upon the castle walls.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302120527", "6301976932", "6301977181", "6301977149", "6303212263", "6305123616", "B00004RFHL", "6301574117", "0790743159", "6300214060", "B00005A1VH", "6304178352", "0792839846", "630233683X", "6301977173", "6302961688", "630150528X", "6304935811", "B00005RRG6", "B00000JKNP", "6301973305", "6301670140", "1558800034", "0792107683", "B00004RGUU", "0782008348"], "bought_together": ["6301977149"], "also_viewed": ["B00005PJ8I"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 538065}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6304546386", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RMAFMQ02L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Adventures of Robin Hood [VHS]"}
{"description": "One of the greatest screen biographies ever produced, this monumental film runs nearly three hours, won seven Academy Awards, and gave George C. Scott the greatest role of his career. It was released in 1970 when protest against the Vietnam War still raged at home and abroad, and many critics and moviegoers struggled to reconcile current events with the movie's glorification of Gen. George S. Patton as a crazy-brave genius of World War II.How could a movie so huge in scope and so fascinated by its subject be considered an anti-war film? The simple truth is that it's not--Patton is less about World War II than about the rise and fall of a man whose life was literally defined by war, and who felt lost and lonely without the grand-scale pursuit of an enemy. George C. Scott embodies his role so fully, so convincingly, that we can't help but be drawn to and fascinated by Patton as a man who is simultaneously bound for hell and glory. The film's opening monologue alone is a masterful display of acting and character analysis, and everything that follows is sheer brilliance on the part of Scott and director Franklin J. Schaffner.Filmed on an epic scale at literally dozens of European locations, Patton does not embrace war as a noble pursuit, nor does it deny the reality of war as a breeding ground for heroes. Through the awesome achievement of Scott's performance and the film's grand ambition, Patton shows all the complexities of a man who accepted his role in life and (like Scott) played it to the hilt.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303057225", "0800132009", "B0007TKNGA", "6304071876", "6302909023", "6301966317", "6300181472", "B000059HGY", "6300214826", "6300268748", "079213690X", "630407185X", "B00000K3AN", "6301797906", "6301115430", "079284646X", "0790701251", "0790752395", "6302529441", "0783221347", "B00000F13T", "6300216543", "B00006C7G9", "6304151306", "B00005LL26", "630018224X", "6301971809", "6301965817", "6300181340", "630442972X", "6300988473", "630105573X", "0783216084", "6301777867", "B00003CXTF", "B000003KDG", "6303020089", "6301969251", "B000003KHS", "B00004CNR5", "6301662954", "0784011923", "B00000FZCU", "6300215962", "0800100832", "1569942072", "B00003CXE6", "6300271846", "6300181154", "630274721X", "0790734079", "0764004638", "0800125762", "6302415853", "6301976622", "630018627X", "B00005A1VG", "B000007OY0", "B000068TSI", "B00005ATQA", "0800116917", "6300216802", "6303696813", "6300267830", "0790758474", "0792116887", "0783235607", "630197154X", "B00005Q4GY", "B0000048YO", "6302224330", "0800106032", "6303824358", "B000056BRF", "6304457278", "6300267938", "6300182304"], "bought_together": ["6303057225"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 219212}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.74, "brand": "", "asin": "6304935811", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/418V1BMMHEL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Patton [VHS]"}

{"description": "David O. Selznick wantedGone with the Windto be somehow more than a movie, a film that would broaden the very idea of what a film could be and do and look like. In many respects he got what he worked so hard to achieve in this 1939 epic (and all-time box-office champ in terms of tickets sold), and in some respects he fell far short of the goal. While the first half of this Civil War drama is taut and suspenseful and nostalgic, the second is ramshackle and arbitrary. But there's no question that the film is an enormous achievement in terms of its every resource--art direction, color, sound, cinematography--being pushed to new limits for the greater glory of telling an American story as fully as possible. Vivien Leigh is still magnificently narcissistic, Olivia de Havilland angelic and lovely, Leslie Howard reckless and aristocratic.

{"description": "If you were to argue that Mel Brooks'sYoung Frankensteinranks among the top-ten funniest movies of all time, nobody could reasonably dispute the claim. Spoofing classic horror in the way that Brooks's previous filmBlazing Saddlessent up classic Westerns, the movie is both a loving tribute and a raucous, irreverent parody of Universal's classic horror filmsFrankenstein(1931) andBride of Frankenstein(1935). Filming in glorious black and white, Brooks re-created theFrankensteinlaboratory using the same equipment from the originalFrankenstein(courtesy of designer Kenneth Strickfaden), and this loving attention to physical and stylistic detail creates a solid foundation for nonstop comedy. The story, of course, involves Frederick Frankenstein (Gene Wilder) and his effort to resume experiments in re-animation pioneered by his late father. (He's got some help, since dad left behind a book titledHow I Did It.) Assisting him is the hapless hunchback Igor (Marty Feldman) and the buxom but none-too-bright maiden Inga (Teri Garr), and when Frankenstein succeeds in creating his monster (Peter Boyle), the stage is set for an outrageous revision of the Frankenstein legend. With comedy highlights too numerous to mention, Brooks guides his brilliant cast (also including Cloris Leachman, Madeline Kahn, Kenneth Mars, and Gene Hackman in a classic cameo role) through scene after scene of inspired hilarity. Indeed,Young Frankensteinis a charmed film, nothing less than a comedy classic, representing the finest work from everyone involved. Not one joke has lost its payoff, and none of the countless gags have lost their zany appeal. From a career that includes some of the best comedies ever made, this is the film for which Mel Brooks will be most fondly remembered.

{"description": "It may not seem like the most obvious kind of Huston country, but this black Mafia comedy fits perfectly with the John Huston mindset.  Adapted from Richard Condon's novel, the film stars Nicholson as a none-too-bright hit man for a Mafia family who falls in love with an independent operator--a female killer played by Kathleen Turner. The two make a surprisingly funny couple, whether taking a fling at domesticity or comparing professional notes. But their romance is threatened by the woman Nicholson has jilted: the don's daughter, played by Anjelica Huston in a particularly well-etched and poisonous portrayal, for which she won an Oscar. Look for equally tasty turns by cast members William Hickey, John Randolph, and Robert Loggia.--Marshall Fine", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000007PI4", "6303282237", "6301247485", "6302281415"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 625721}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.97, "brand": "", "asin": "6305164215", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/517EGRWBNSL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Prizzi's Honor [VHS]"}
{"description": "Christmas is not a good time of year in the McClane family. Especially  for John McClane, who always happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. But if it weren't for the heroics of this rugged, resourceful cop, many lives would be lost and megalomaniacal terrorists with various European accents would be having their evil way. In 1988, director John McTiernan and the phenomenal hitDie Hardintroduced the world to maverick Sgt. John McClane (Bruce Willis) of the New York Police Department, and in the course of this film and two blockbuster sequels McClane was frantically saving lives, buildings, airports, schools, cities, and even his marriage from the threat of international terrorists, psychopaths, and cagey mercenaries. Now you can watch antihero McClane blast his way through all three movies. Witness his transition from a happy-go-lucky, slightly cranky cop to extremely burnt-out, partially alcoholic cop with a propensity to attract extreme violence and catastrophe. Yet the one thing that always overshadows his character flaws is his uncanny ability to spoil the schemes of stylish villains with slick names such as Hans Gruber (the nasty terrorist from the first film, played to perfection by Alan Rickman). Sit down, pop some corn, grab a bottle of Coca-Cola, and get ready to watch (in any order you please) theDie Hard Trilogy--a must for any action buff or fan of Bruce Willis, who owes his film career to the enduring appeal of these global box-office hits.--Jeremy Storey", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000VNMMR0", "B000U1ZV8K", "B00BUAEYVK", "B002GSXKNS", "B0004Z33G4", "B000MGBLSC", "B000MGBSE4", "B001VLBDD0", "B000XT1P4S", "B00005N5S5", "B0015XHP4A", "6304711891", "6304806434", "B005COLETU", "0790729695", "B00000G3PA", "B00388PK7O", "B000MGBLTQ", "B000JYW5BE", "B00004STDN", "B0006GANOQ", "B001TK80C0", "B00003CXC5", "B004EPYZUS", "B000U1ZV62", "B001DJLD1M", "B000U1ZV4Y", "B009MF5BXK", "B005CFBYW6", "B0057RCFQS", "B0054OGQM8", "B005PTYP70", "B00000ILDH", "B00004Z4WR", "B00005JA8B", "B002ZG999U", "B00070FX5U", "B0018CMJSU", "B00008G8M4", "B00JU949TK", "B008E70EES", "B0045HCJFS", "B0004Z33EG", "B00AKGG828", "B008JFURII", "B001B3LIOC", "B002GSXKP6", "B00026ZG10", "B003Q6D2B4", "B000BPL2FQ", "B009HIKAN8", "B000TGJ8CQ", "B000QUCRB4", "B0004Z33F0", "B000059H9A", "B000RJO56E", "B000HT38BM", "B000P0J06K", "B006VRRGNK", "6304712987", "0790738953", "B00016MSV2", "0767803434", "0790736411", "B003AWRMCE", "B00562I40K", "0783226888", "B00005R2IS", "B00023B1LC", "B002Z7FWBI", "B000FO0AA6", "B001E75QH0", "0767807588", "B00015YVDG", "B001TODCII", "B005LAIGLE", "0800195175", "B00005ATZT", "B00BEJL6JK", "B001AJIHC8", "B00005JKIP", "B00BLF9FOK", "B004SIP9Z6", "B004GJYRK0", "B00029NMRM", "B000VWYJ86", "B007X4ECMI", "B000F9RB9Y", "B000P0J0EM", "B0009X76XC", "B00AEFYUQQ", "B001ZGKOG8", "B000NA1WGS", "B007SPPANM", "B00AEFXKUI", "0790731924", "6305767866", "B00007AJG4", "B003ASLJNQ", "B004AZ7ZKY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000YGDNPO", "B00BUAEYVK", "B000O78KW4", "B000U1ZV8K"]}, "price": 30.25, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 225698}, "asin": "6305286566", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Y1Q1JSPHL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Die Hard Trilogy"}

{"description": "This 1997 film from Norway and neophyte director Erik Skjoldbj&aelig;rg  delivers the goods with unsettling effectiveness. It's an intense, smart,  and taut thriller if only because what it eerily implies is creepier than the  film's reality. Opening with a churning, chilling murder of a young woman,Insomniainvites the viewer--as well as its protagonist, celebrated Oslo  homicide cop Jonas Engstr&ouml;m (Stellan Skarsg&aring;rd)--into the mind and  thoughts of a killer by making Engstr&ouml;m fatally flawed himself. While in pursuit of  the murderer, Engstr&ouml;m makes a mistake; he accidentally shoots his partner and  friend and covers up his deed in a panic. But he overlooks a minor detail:  the real killer has seen him commit the crime. What ensues is a layered,  complex, and unnerving descent into chaos, brought on by the inability to  sleep in this land of the midnight sun. Engstr&ouml;m suffers from insomnia,  which  warps his logic and resolve, and before long he's totally unraveled and  unsure of his every move. But not before a twisty transference and  countertransference occurs between cop and killer. The two play a game of  high-stakes one-upmanship that surprises in the end.Insomniais fresh and  psychologically bent, full of Scandinavian despair and dark humor, and it  boasts a film noir pulse beneath its blinding light.--Paula  Nechak", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005NFZC", "B00006FMCS", "B003LR5BD0", "B00JH4SZWK", "B00JPUUSEE", "B0081HLM2E", "B00000F3CD", "B00GBT62PQ", "B000BB14IA", "B004XVMCH6", "B00HE010QM", "B004N1JGI4", "B001CW7ZSA", "0780022343", "B004ALIG4M", "B005J47Q90", "B00JAQJNN0", "B00K6D1R0I", "B00004W3HG", "B00HT2RTU6", "B003KGBISE", "B004NWPY3E", "B00180R06I", "B00005BHW6", "B001CW7ZSU", "B00000CQJZ", "B00HVOFP6W", "B00005EBSF", "B00000C0QO", "B00005JL57", "B001EOQCJE", "B00HRJVHOU", "B00GPPXNEE", "B00HE01030", "B0000A02TX", "B004ALIG1U", "B0009298N4", "B002IVDLH8", "B00GPPXP6A", "0783228457", "B004WPYO7E", "B00J81S92S", "B000BR6QIW", "B00005A8TX", "B000093NQZ", "B001PYD0KM", "B00000F7E6", "0792838947", "B005152C9G", "B00FXOO2A2", "B001WLMOL4", "B003ELMR9E", "0780021541", "B00B2BYXSG", "B00AQ6J536", "B0002KPHZG", "B003TTBA0S", "B0007GAG42", "B004P2VQZ2", "B0009OUBC4", "6305228876", "B00005QAPH", "B000087EY5", "B00B2BYXTK", "B00005B1ZL", "B001BEK8E2", "B007N5YJWK", "B00005NC66", "B000I8OOG0", "B00JJ3EHCG", "B005KQVE1S", "B001BSBBJE", "B00HE011DE", "B001MYIXAC", "B004NWPY20", "B00005JMVQ", "B00004W3HF", "0780023099", "B000H5U5RG", "B00DZP1C9K", "B0057GYODG", "B00HVOFP9O", "B0009X75EC", "B002BWP4A6", "0780023277", "B00CUKTHES", "B00JQYV0B4", "B000KRNGOA", "B00F98FOFY", "B000305ZYS", "078062856X", "B000OPPAF6", "B001PYD0M0", "B00KE3B7BE", "B0047P5FU4", "B002E01MBA", "B00E18QKJ2", "B00JBGSHSQ", "B00005QAPI", "B006TTC5MM"], "bought_together": ["B00005NFZC", "B00006FMCS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005K3NY", "B00JJ3EHCG", "B00J2PQYYK", "B00J5JSV3A"]}, "price": 22.32, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 40121}, "asin": "6305389519", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/310DKGT5SAL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Insomnia (The Criterion Collection)"}

{"description": "Based on thenovelby  Max Evans and directed by Stephen Frears,The Hi-Lo  Countrycharted a long and circuitous route to the big screen, and the final result  proves that the material posed a major--and perhaps insurmountable--challenge for  screen adaptation. It's easy to see why this contemporary Western was once a  coveted project of director Sam Peckinpah; its codes of honor, male bonding, and  hardened morality would've played nicely into Peckinpah's artistic legacy. There are  clear echoes of Peckinpah in the screenplay by Walon Green (who wroteThe  Wild Bunch), and while the movie is blessed by Woody Harrelson's vivid performance as a reckless latter-day cowboy, Frears fails to maintain a compelling  tone and the rest of the cast nearly fades into the background.Billy Crudup (Without Limits) plays Harrelson's best pal, just returned to  New Mexico from service in World War&nbsp;II with hopes of starting a cattle ranch free  from the greedy clutches of a local rancher (Sam Elliott) who dominates the town of  Hi-Lo like a bootclad kingpin. Harrelson joins in the effort, but tensions rise when he  connects with the sultry seductress (Patricia Arquette) with whom Crudup has fallen  inexplicably in love. Harrelson has provoked others as well, and he seems primed for  a fall, butThe Hi-Lo Countryis a film out of balance. Memorable moments  are found in abundance, and the film's period detail is impeccable, but Crudup's  character is so underwritten and underplayed that his role as narrator and ostensible  hero has minimal dramatic impact. By the time fate deals its inevitable blow, it's too  late to care. Frears has suffered from similar missteps before (rememberMary  Reilly?), andThe Hi-Lo Countryleaves you wondering what Peckinpah  might have done with the novel he so dearly admired.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00A92MF6Q", "B000059XTH", "B00000HYSM", "B003552QX6", "B009INAI02", "B00A92MD8G", "B0042RJWTM", "B007PXYWNQ", "B000EHSVUU", "0783229631", "B00IO03I6Q", "B00HLSW6N8", "B000IONLP4", "B00JOWHTB8", "B000F8O2QU", "B00005LOL4", "B00AEBB8W4", "B005DEUER2", "B00F3TDA6O", "B00006AUHQ", "B000O599WQ", "B000089765", "B00EU8RBXW", "B00ALCBTWU", "B0008ENHUS", "B0001GF2JC", "B0007QJ210", "B000PMFRYW", "B0007US7FI", "B00004ZBVF", "B0007OY2NA", "B000BT96DC", "0425168077", "B00AEFY9GW", "1889921521", "B0001XAOMU", "B00501N420", "B004SEUJOQ", "B00AEFYPHA", "B000FTCLQC", "B00362K324", "B0024FADC4", "B00007AJFB", "B0000694Y3", "6305504024", "B000056H2H", "B00007G78A", "B00HUCF420", "B001B187NO", "B00HOGBXS6", "B00005NBYE", "B00J49R1BY", "B003MRD9KQ", "B000059H7K", "B00JA3RVG4", "0767817729", "B00AFEY7RI", "0385267231", "B00936A0RU", "B003B3NV8G", "B0000TANUI", "B000KNFP6G", "B0035JHYJI", "B0001FGBW0", "B00GDDNMEY", "B002BIULMQ", "B00991151O", "B003NF97MQ", "B00AIBZMD6", "B003UESJME", "B00GMV8M2Y", "B00BEIYKX0", "B00AEFXZ76", "B000EOTUSU", "B0007TKNHE", "B005S9ELVC", "1573624055", "6305128952", "B00005LOL0", "B000056H2G", "B00D9EJFU0", "B000DZIGDU", "B00GUO2SKA", "B008L3650W", "B00GST8U4U", "B00BFAIH68", "B008XAT10E", "B00003CWSX", "B00EIXWW2O", "B00B5J6A7W", "B00023P4U6", "B004P7CMVE", "B001GD6VTE", "B0001CNRRU", "B00002E20R", "B00008CMR6", "B001GLLOFW", "B000059TFO", "B008Y5OWSO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00A92MF6Q", "B00000HYSM", "0783229631", "B000059XTH"]}, "price": 14.98, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 141511}, "asin": "6305447187", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41DSXJC5DSL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Hi-Lo Country"}

{"description": "Majid Majidi celebrates the immediacy and essence of childhood in this delightful tale of a brother and sister who share a pair of shoes when the boy (though no fault of his own) loses his sister's only pair. Since their parents are too poor to afford a new pair, they keep it a secret, trading them off every day in a mad rush, jumping gutters and navigating the twisting lanes to their schools and back. Then the boy hatches a plan: the third-place prize in a student footrace is a new pair of shoes, and he's determined to take it. The plot may smack of a Disney film, but the direction couldn't be more different. The family scenes are delicately observed, and Majidi captures the spirit of the children perfectly: proud, emotional, petulant, sweet, and disarmingly sincere. The film has a Western-friendly framework without losing the naturalistic eye and lolling rhythm that gives the best Iranian films their richness. Even as he builds to the climactic footrace (quite unexpectedly turned into a nail-biting contest) the film continues to reveal a wealth of discreet surprises, culminating in a conclusion all the more resonant for its sublime delicacy. His efforts earned the film the honor of becoming the first Iranian feature to earn an Oscar nomination for Best Foreign Film.--Sean Axmaker", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 401097}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.73, "brand": "", "asin": "6305492115", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ESJRRVA9L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Children of Heaven [VHS]"}
{"description": "There's Something About Maryis one of the funniest movies in years, recalling the days of the Zucker-Abraham-Zucker movies, in which (often tasteless) gags were piled on at a fierce rate. The difference is that cowriters and codirectors Bobby and Peter Farrelly have also crafted a credible story line and even tossed in some genuine emotional content.The Farrelly brothers' first two movies,Dumb and DumberandKingpin, had some moments of uproarious raunch, but were uneven. WithMary, they've created a consistently hilarious romantic comedy, made all the funnier by the fact that you know that they know that some of their gags go way over the line.Cameron Diaz stars as Mary, every guy's ideal. Ben Stiller plays a high-school suitor still hung up on Mary years later; the obstacles standing between him and her include a number of psychotic suitors, a miserable little pooch, and, oh yeah, a murder charge.The Farrellys' admittedly simplistic camera work, which adapts easily to a TV screen, and the fact that you'll likely laugh yourself so silly over certain scenes you'll want to replay them to see what you were missing while you were busy convulsing, make this a perfect video movie.--David Kronke", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300214567"], "also_viewed": ["B00004YZEG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 467528}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 0.01, "brand": "", "asin": "6305499071", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41T5QB162RL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "There's Something About Mary (Special Edition) [VHS]"}

{"description": "Volume 7 in this excellent DVD series of originalStar Trekprograms includes \"The Galileo Seven,\" which teleplay writer Oliver Crawford  says was inspired by his viewing of a 1939 film calledFive Came Back. (A catty footnote: David Gerrold, scribe of the famous \"The Trouble with Tribbles\"  episode, called \"The Galileo Seven\" a rip-off of the Jimmy Stewart filmThe Flight of the Phoenix. Meow.)Five Came Backconcerned a plane crash in the Andes and the survivors who faced the constant threat of surrounding headhunters. Crawford toyed with the idea and came up with a story  line in which Spock (Leonard Nimoy), Dr. McCoy (DeForest Kelley), and a couple  of other crew members crash on the surface of a hostile planet during a shuttle mission. With communication between the small craft and theEnterprisedisrupted by quasar activity, Spock and the others must defend  themselves against a formidable threat with only primitive, handmade weapons. That's the scenario, but the real drama is in the rising conflict  between the half-Vulcan Spock's coldly logical approach to survival and the  passions of his human crew, who soon come to regard him as a hateful, unfeeling monster. This is an interesting episode, both as a taut action piece and,  somewhat indirectly, as a portrait of intolerance (specifically, an intolerance  of individual differences) developing under stress.Also on this disc is \"Court Martial,\" a courtroom drama in which Captain Kirk (William Shatner) stands trial for negligence in the death of anEnterprisecrewman. As the proceedings rumble on, Spock investigates some  hidden truths about the dead man and the apparent computer malfunction that led to the  tragedy. While \"Court Martial\" is a lesser episode from theStar Trekcanon (the action is a bit mired in trial proceedings), it's still a  lot of fun and features a supporting role from veteran Hollywood character actor  Elisha Cook Jr.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00001MXXW", "B000022TTP", "0792160932", "6305744882", "B000055Z4J", "6305513406", "6305755035", "B00001MXXS", "B00004Y630", "B000059XU0", "B000022TTI", "B00004Y62Z", "B00005ASGJ", "B00005J6RE", "B0002JJBZO", "6305910464", "6305910537", "B00004W5UI", "0792160959", "6305513414", "B00005BCK7", "B00005KHK3", "B00005KHK4", "B00005J6RF", "B00005N5SE", "B00005QTAR", "B00005M2D0", "B00005BCK6", "B00004W5UH", "B00005ASGI", "B00005M2CZ", "B00005NVDI", "B000059XTZ", "B00005Q79B", "B00005QAPY", "B000055Z4I", "B00005N5SF", "B000A2S7VM", "B0000UJL96", "B004IIPUSC", "B00005QTAS", "B00DB97LRC", "B002I9Z8AS", "B00005NVDJ", "6305755043", "B000PMBEAI"], "bought_together": ["B000022TTP", "B000022TTI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001DHXT6G", "6305910537", "B00005KHK4", "B000055Z4J"]}, "price": 12.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 381790}, "asin": "630574484X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51MB72WA9CL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Star Trek - The Original Series, Vol. 7, Episodes 14 &amp; 15: The Galileo Seven/ Court-Martial"}

{"description": "Pixar genius reigns in this funny romantic comedy, which stars a robot who says absolutely nothing for a full 25 minutes yet somehow completely transfixes and endears himself to the audience within the first few minutes of the film. As the last robot left on earth, Wall-E (voiced by Ben Burtt) is one small robot--with a big, big heart--who holds the future of earth and mankind squarely in the palm of his metal hand. He's outlasted all the \"Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class\" robots that were assigned some 700 years ago to clean up the environmental mess that man made of earth while man vacationed aboard the luxury spaceship Axiom. Wall-E has dutifully gone about his job compacting trash, the extreme solitude broken only by his pet cockroach, but he's developed some oddly human habits and ideas. When the Axiom sends its regularly scheduled robotic EVE probe (Elissa Knight) to earth, Wall-E is instantly smitten and proceeds to try to impress EVE with his collection of human memorabilia. EVE's directive compels her to bring Wall-E's newly collected plant sprout to the captain of the Axiom and Wall-E follows in hot pursuit. Suddenly, the human world is turned upside down and the Captain (Jeff Garlin) joins forces with Wall-E and a cast of other misfit robots to lead the now lethargic people back home to earth. Wall-E is a great family film with the most impressive aspect being the depth of emotion conveyed by a simple robot--a machine typically considered devoid of emotion, but made so absolutely touching by the magic of Pixar animation. Also well-worth admiring are the sweeping views from space, the creative yet disturbing vision of what strange luxuries a future space vacation might offer, and the innovative use of trash in a future cityscape. Underneath the slapstick comedy and touching love story is a poignant message about the folly of human greed and its potential effects on earth and the entire human race.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000VBJEEG", "B001KVZ6FW", "B00007LVCM", "B00BG0RSJ4", "B00AFEX83C", "0736424229", "B00005JN4W", "B00005JNQS", "B0042U94UQ", "B00E9ZATJO", "B001OMU6UM", "B00005JNS0", "B0030IIZ4M", "B0034JKZ86", "B002ZG97YM", "B002WJI2QQ", "B004HO6I4M", "B008YWY0HK", "B0012EM5D8", "B0006UEVT0", "B009SZCC9U", "B004G600A4", "B00AAXFYPI", "B00F522C7C", "B008Z1LBU4", "B00CTNYLQA", "B003H9M1Q2", "B000AAF1TU", "B008JFUQ16", "B000ROAK2W", "B000AY74OG", "B00275EHJG", "B00CWM58WY", "B00009M9BK", "B00EV1YZ96", "B001DPHDCY", "B000MV9026", "B001O5LVPI", "0783231474", "B00CQRN3QI", "B00G5G7EXY", "B00I6JOD2S", "B001HN6922", "B00GDT5T9Y", "B0087F7VSY", "B001U2MQE0", "B0030IIYYS", "B00A83075M", "B00H4Z07Q6", "B005LAIH4A", "B000DWMYQ8", "B00CHVJODE", "B0000AOX0O", "B003UESJF6", "B00JK531ES", "B00HLTD2OE", "B0001I561E", "B00BGYO7HG", "B003ZHVJGO", "B001ILFUD2", "B0002YLCOM", "B0039N74CW", "B00004U9WQ", "B00937R6QC", "B00CUDD0C0", "B004EPZ034", "B00004R99S", "B00003CXB4", "B000065V42", "B00005RDSQ", "B004ZBACOE", "B001GCUO7A", "B00AO686JC", "B000AAF1U4", "B0006JMLRK", "B00005JMQZ", "B0043X1FOK", "B00C7JGDBW", "B001JRB17Y", "B001KVZ6G6", "B00005TN8K", "B00005JMFH", "B00E9ZATKI", "B001ILFUDC", "B000V1Y44G", "B00003CX8Y", "B0011U52E2", "B00EBBGLFC", "B000YERP2S", "B00009YXAW", "B00003CXCQ", "B002NZK5SW", "B000G75AZC", "B00CNW9ZI6", "B0084IHVGG", "B00947N6D8", "B004LWZW7Y"], "bought_together": ["B001KVZ6FW", "B000VBJEEG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004HO6I4M", "B001KVZ6FW", "B00I6JOD2S", "B00005JN4W"]}, "price": 17.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 319062}, "asin": "7883706837", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51u-jDIxUZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)"}
{"description": "What kind of guy is Tom Paris (Robert Duncan McNeill) exactly? Keeping  in mind that his character was introduced onVoyageras a pilot thrown  out of Starfleet for covering up an accident, then later jailed for his  (bungled) role as a Maquis mercenary, one might say he's a heel seeking  redemption atVoyager's con. But \"Ex Post Facto\" suggests he's still a  scoundrel at heart.When Paris and Harry Kim (Garrett Wang) dine in the home of Banean scientist  Tolen Ren (Ray Reinhardt), Tom becomes distracted by the restless beauty of the  man's wife (Robin McKee), leading to an illicit liaison that ends with the  murder of Ren. Paris is accused, found guilty, and uniquely punished by  experiencing Ren's death, from the victim's point of view, every 14 hours in his  mind. It's up to Commander Tuvok (Tim Russ) to get to the bottom of the mystery.There's lots of controversy about the value of this episode. One camp believes  Paris is unfairly stereotyped, that the film noir elements in the script and  visual style are perfunctory, and that the story is a rehash ofThe Next  Generation's \"A Matter of Perspective.\" Others, particularly writer Michael  Piller, believe it to be a blend of detective drama andThe Twilight  Zone. In fact, all those assessments are valid: the episode is both overly  predictable and dark.--Tom Keogh", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 853865}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 4.95, "brand": "", "asin": "B000003K9K", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/414N0JJE9FL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Star Trek - Voyager, Episode 8: Ex Post Facto [VHS]"}

{"description": "\"Something is going on here. Something I don't understand.\" So states the old lighthouse keeper on the remote, fog-shrouded island of Fang Rock in this haunting story from Doctor Who's 15th season. If you are a new visitor to the universe of this venerable British sci-fi series, no doubt you will share his sentiment.But for this particular story, you need not know that Doctor Who is a Time Lord who travels the cosmos in a spacecraft called theTARDIS, an interplanetary time machine that looks like a police call box, or that Tom Baker, who portrays him here, is the fourth and perhaps most popular incarnation of the good Doctor.Horror of Fang Rockis as much ghost story as science fiction. The TARDIS has deposited the vacation-bound Doctor and his companion, Leela, on Fang Rock (\"You told me I would like Brighton,\" an unimpressed Leela remarks about the desolate surroundings), just after a strange light was witnessed plummeting from the sky into the sea. A mysterious fog envelopes the lighthouse, and one of its inhabitants is mysteriously killed. When a ship runs aground, its passengers take refuge in the lighthouse and find themselves stalked as well. Is it the mythical Beast of Fang Rock or, as the Doctor suspects, an alien menace?The cheesy mid-1970s-vintage special effects are part of this show's charm. Like Rocky and Bullwinkle cartoons, whatDoctor Wholacks in production values, it more than makes up for in verbal ingenuity. \"Are you in charge?\" someone asks the Doctor. \"No,\" he responds, \"but I'm full of ideas.\"--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["6304154151", "B000035Z2A", "6303943306", "6301628551", "6304304226", "B00005U2KP", "6302000645", "630180130X", "6304052898", "6304154143", "6304432410", "6304052871", "6304154194", "B00000AOAV", "6303631932", "B00004WG6Z", "B00004WG8L", "6301801261", "B00005U2KO", "B00004WG6D", "6302256755", "6303058868", "B00004WG73", "630430420X", "6303482643", "630305885X", "B00004W21U", "B00005Y72I", "6301628500", "B00004WG7L", "6302993628", "6302993636", "630288456X", "6303943314", "6303058884", "6302000610", "630254176X", "6302884969", "6302884586", "6303943322", "6303058876", "B00004CVA6", "6304052936", "6303145906", "6301628543", "6303145884", "630299361X", "6301801253", "B000051S4W"], "bought_together": ["6301628551"]}, "price": 32.92, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 266677}, "asin": "B00000AOAH", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510EP50EYQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Doctor Who - Horror of Fang Rock [VHS]"}
{"description": "There's no rule against rock anthems from the 1970s in the soundtrack for a movie about a medieval jousting champion, but if you're going to attempt such jarring anachronisms, you'd better establish acceptable ground rules. Writer-director Brian Helgeland does precisely that inA Knight's Taleand pulls off this trick with such giddy aplomb that you can't help but play along. (Upon witnessing a crowd of peasants at a jousting match, singing and clapping to the beat of Queen's \"We Will Rock You,\" you're either going to love this movie or dismiss it altogether.) Other vintage rock hits will follow, but Helgeland--the Oscar&#xAE;-winning cowriter ofL.A. Confidential--handles this ploy with judicious goodwill, in what is an otherwise honest period piece about a peasant named William (Heath Ledger) who rises by grit and determination to the hallowed status of knighthood.As if the soundtrack weren't audacious enough, Helgeland (recovering from the sour experience of his directorial debut,Payback) casts none other than Geoffrey Chaucer (wonderfully played by Paul Bettany) as William's cohort and match announcer, along with William's pals Roland (Mark Addy) and Wat (Alan Tudyk), and feisty blacksmith Kate (Laura Fraser). Of course there must be a fair maiden, and she is Jocelyn (newcomer Shannyn Sossamon), with whom William falls in love while battling the nefarious Count Adhemar (Rufus Sewell) on the European jousting circuit. Add to this an inspiring father-son reunion, Ledger's undeniable charisma, a perfect supporting cast, and enough joyful energy to rejuvenate the film's formulaic plot, andA Knight's Talebecomes that most pleasant of movie surprises--an unlikely winner that rises up, like its hero, to exceed all expectations.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000EDWKXI", "0800141601", "B00447L4KA", "B00006ZXSK", "B004SEUIWY", "B002VWNID6", "B00004XPPG", "B00003CXC3", "B00005EBIL", "B000ARXF96", "B00AEFXKUI", "B004SUDQ40", "B001HN69AY", "B004SIP9U6", "0792839137", "B0002YLCG0", "B003UYUQZW", "B003FCKIGQ", "B000056VP4", "B002NZK5V4", "B00005JLO2", "B002O3Z50Q", "B002O3Z4XY", "B00AEFY5B6", "B000GGSMO4", "6305428077", "B00003CXG7", "B00004WG2F", "B00005JN0T", "B0010V4VJY", "B005ORVN00", "B00000JQB5", "6305428042", "6305123454", "0783225814", "B00AEBB9UU", "6305692688", "B0000WN0SW", "B000MGUZCU", "B00006ADFM", "B00005JKCH", "B00AMEZDJW", "B0000TPA0G", "B0000844I8", "B002GHHHHO", "0783240295", "B000K7VHQ4", "B00000K3UU", "B00005JKMN", "B000EPFCPE", "B0006GAI5U", "B0007IO6NM", "B002K0WBXW", "0767821513", "B00005QJJG", "B00008EYA5", "B00004Z4WR", "B00005JKNV", "B00005LOL0", "B004SIP6BI", "B00003CXHJ", "B002NXSRVG", "B002ZG999U", "B004SEUJ9Q", "0783233477", "B000T5O47Q", "B00F84H73Q", "B003U0AHBO", "B00004W4UD", "B00AEFXYOA", "B000AARKOO", "B00AEFZ6V4", "B00005JM5B", "B0001HLVS2", "6305428387", "B002GHHHME", "B000LC55F2", "B00AEBB8R4", "B007SPPANM", "B001GZ6QC4", "B00BLN4V46", "B000EGDB10", "0800195175", "B000FKO5QK", "B000U7WV1Y", "B00BTYSIWI", "B0038N9X3Q", "6305609764", "B000K4WPCC", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B00011CZRE", "B00005JMOW", "0800141741", "B00005JPD0", "B001DDBD4K", "B00008G7UF", "B000209KMW", "1558908382", "B004LWZWGA", "B0009RCPUW"], "bought_together": ["B00447L4KA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0800141601", "B00447L4KA", "B00003CXC3"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 7604}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.99, "brand": "Columbia Telecommunications", "asin": "B00000F4ZY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51rNtZ4oMwL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "A Knight's Tale (Special Edition)"}
{"description": "This DVD is packed with extras designed for kids and special-effects enthusiastics. Stuart himself hosts the extras, guiding the viewer through the special menus. A favorite with the kids will probably be the game asking questions about the movie. Using clips from the movie and three different levels, it's quite appealing. As for meatier things, there is a curious look at animators' \"tryouts\" in creating Stuart, plus excellent demonstrations of how Stuart interacts with humans, using multiple images and commentary. Another highlight is seeing the first conceptual drawings of the boat race, vastly different from the final sequence. There are two commentary tracks on the film, one with the visual-effects team revealing their secrets and the other with the engaging director, Rob Minkoff. Also including  short documentaries, music videos, and a read-along book with Stuart,  this is a rare disc because the kids will like the extras as much as the film.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JLGM", "B000M343BC", "B00003CXJ4", "B000CQ98FU", "B00AEFXMSS", "B004HO6I4M", "B0006JMLRK", "B002WJI2QQ", "B000MV9026", "B0012EM5D8", "B001DPHDCY", "B004EPZ034", "6305161887", "B00005JNQS", "0783231474", "B005SDUV4E", "B0006UEVT0", "B00CWM58WY", "B0000AOX0O", "B000065V42", "B00000JL8E", "B0000VV4W2", "B005F96UJ6", "B00029LO0Y", "0783219806", "0783219733", "B0000VCZKW", "B00H5NY7O0", "B0000AK7AB", "B00009YXAW", "B000RMJ4F8", "B00AEFYO08", "B00GT85OLC", "B00005JG6M", "B000UVKGPI", "B000XKW2WG", "B003L4Y5BW", "B001U3D88M", "0064400565", "B00005JM7T", "B000ION23A", "B007FF3HQM", "B0006J28MI", "B000EOMB9U", "B0018ATR2S", "B00005LB87", "B002GHHHNS", "B001GCUNWQ", "B005LAIIT4", "B003R2BWJG", "B00005JMQZ", "B000056H26", "B000LPS2VI", "B0084IHVUC", "B004LWZW9W", "B008R65XKG", "B00EBBGLFC", "B00028HBES", "B0030ZIZRC", "B004AKCME8", "B00AEFXMGU", "B001LPWGFA", "0783232292", "B0000VCZKM", "B005LAIISA", "B000U1ZV5I", "B000NQRV4Y", "B000CZ0PT4", "B00JK531ES", "B008R65XPQ", "B001P4Q3CY", "B0000UJDLM", "B00003CXG7", "B00B7EQPNE", "B001ILFUD2", "B000J10FLY", "B000AY74OG", "B0042U94UQ", "B00CTNYLQA", "B00K2CHSS8", "B008NNY9QW", "B00006LPHB", "B000V5IP6U", "B00HLTD2OE", "B0009NZ2KG", "B000P0J09W", "B00365F6I2", "B000A2WAQK", "B00F522C7C", "B007R6DJP8", "B0087F7VSY", "B000Y11B7G", "B0039N74CW", "B00005JMFH", "B0016Q2D5M", "B003H9M1Q2", "B00005JLR2", "B000H5TH2A", "B00DV2MVWO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004HO6I4M", "B00CWM58WY", "B004EPZ034", "B000H5TH2A"]}, "price": 12.86, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 149960}, "asin": "B00000F7AE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51YZM5J2MJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Stuart Little (Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "Hidden throughoutCach&#xE9;is the sense that you should be watching every moment in this film closely, just as the protagonists are themselves being watched by someone unknown. Georges and Anne Laurent&#x92;s (Daniel Auteuil and Juliette Binoche) enviable lives are terrorized by the sudden arrival on their doorstep of a videotaped recording of their Parisian townhouse. It&#x92;s nothing but a long, unedited shot of the fa&#xE7;ade of their house, but it&#x92;s disturbing nonetheless. Soon another arrives, this time of the farmhouse Georges grew up in, and then another of a car driving down a suburban street, and a walk down a hallway to a low-rent apartment. Again the videos are benign but unsettling. Then the mystery becomes more threatening when they receive gruesome postcards depicting child-like drawings of bloody, dead stick figures. Georges believes he knows who the culprit is, but for reasons all his own  refuses to let his wife in on the secret. Clearly more is hidden here than just the identity of their stalker. InCach&#xE9;, writer and director Michael Haneke skillfully, methodically pulls back multiple layers of deception, like new skin being pulled off an old wound. he masterfully fuses elements of his predecessors to create a film that is haunting and memorable. There is Bergman's fascination with the complexity of relationships, the suspense and lurking danger of Hitchcock, and the unique cinematic sensibility of Antonioni. In fact, the provocative final shot is practically a tribute toThe Passenger--a lot of people will want to rewatch it many times to see what they can find in it (if, after watching it, you are still unsatisfied with the resolution, then watch the interview with Haneke in the DVD's special features for his insights). It's a film of great effect and intrigue. There are no easy resolutions, and the answers given in this mystery will only lead to more questions.--Daniel Vancini", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002BWP4A6", "B00006LPER", "B000SIWHAK", "B00386OWUC", "B00187FPC2", "B00062134E", "B000068MAL", "6305228876", "B0002DB52M", "B00AIBZLHS", "B002BWP3UC", "B000OVLBGC", "B000B9EYFW", "B002AG2NTI", "B0057GYODG", "B00005N89H", "B0036TGSJE", "B000G0O5IM", "B000MTEFP0", "B00092ZLEY", "B0012QE4PI", "B0019UGYAU", "B00005N8A9", "B00023P4N8", "B0007Z0NYQ", "B0001EFUFK", "B000EHQU3A", "B002VKB0M4", "B00151QYE4", "B00005JKJA", "B000N4SHOO", "B00HVOFP6W", "B00AIBZLR8", "B005KQVE1S", "B00K0MM4AM", "B004WPYO7E", "B00HE011DE", "B006KH6CF4", "B000N3T0DW", "B00008976W", "B0007OCG5G", "B000059HA5", "B000083C5F", "B00GPPXNQ2", "B00018D40O", "B002VECLXC", "B00AX7PGQS", "B003VA3JTA", "B00005QAPJ", "B00005OSLQ", "B003Y5H4R0", "B00HT2RTU6", "6305744114", "B00005K9O8", "B00429MM1K", "B002P7UCJK", "080215056X", "B000E5LEV0", "B00009W0U4", "B000EHQU30", "B000BRBA8S", "B00JJ3EHCG", "B00IGK6TH4", "B00005JLQW", "B0007GAG42", "B00000K3TS", "B00K72HVBC", "B00005NFZC", "B000HIVIQU", "B000N6TX1I", "B000OCY7JE", "B007A9EGG8", "B001CIOCLC", "B00AEBB89W", "B000N2HBIO", "B00CQ8HCSM", "B000EQ5V2C", "B000E6EGT6", "B000934FC2", "B0087IT8FK", "B002BWP3UM", "B0006Z2NCM", "B00GRA7M2G", "B00ATK015K", "6305999872", "B001AZJKKK", "B000GBEWNY", "B000GBEWPC", "B00F6SHGF8", "B00008976Y", "B000FVQM2Y", "B00H4IR3JC", "B004ODLUIU", "B0006IUE9I", "B004YCKKH8", "B00455JE58", "B002ZG4Q66", "B0081HLM2E", "B00AEFXN9G", "B0024FAG2Q"], "bought_together": ["B002BWP4A6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002BWP4A6", "B00187FPC2", "B0036TGSJE", "B00006LPER"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 17815}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.28, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B00000F7E6", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41CS99VVAKL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Cache (Hidden)"}

{"description": "When Steven Spielberg was an adolescent, his first home movie was a backyard war film. When he toured Europe withDuelin his 20s, he saw old men crumble in front of headstones at Omaha Beach. That image became the opening scene ofSaving Private Ryan, his film of a mission following the D-day invasion that many have called the most realistic--and maybe the best--war film ever. With 1998 production standards, Spielberg has been able to create a stunning, unparalleled view of war as hell. We are at Omaha Beach as troops are slaughtered by Germans yet overcome the almost insurmountable odds.A stalwart Tom Hanks plays Captain Miller, a soldier's soldier, who takes a small band of troops behind enemy lines to retrieve a private whose three brothers have recently been killed in action. It's a public relations move for the Army, but it has historical precedent dating back to the Civil War. Some critics of the film have labeled the central characters stereotypes. If that is so, this movie gives stereotypes a good name: Tom Sizemore as the deft sergeant, Edward Burns as the hotheaded Private Reiben, Barry Pepper as the religious sniper, Adam Goldberg as the lone Jew, Vin Diesel as the oversize Private Caparzo, Giovanni Ribisi as the soulful medic, and Jeremy Davies, who as a meek corporal gives the film its most memorable performance.The movie is as heavy and realistic as Spielberg's Oscar-winningSchindler's List, but it's more kinetic. Spielberg and his ace technicians (the film won five Oscars: editing (Michael Kahn), cinematography (Janusz Kaminski), sound, sound effects, and directing) deliver battle sequences that wash over the eyes and hit the gut. The violence is extreme but never gratuitous. The final battle, a dizzying display of gusto, empathy, and chaos, leads to a profound repose.Saving Private Ryantouches us deeper thanSchindlerbecause it succinctly links the past with how we should feel today. It's the film Spielberg was destined to make.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00006C7G9", "6303168507", "6303057225", "B00AEBBA36", "6302529441", "0800125762", "6304935811", "B00003CXTF", "B000EHSVS2", "0790734060", "6303257844", "6302415853", "B0007TKNGA", "6301247345", "6301662954", "0790734079", "6302610702", "6302909023", "630407185X", "0783221347", "079213690X", "0800132009", "0790701251", "6305363668", "6301115430", "0790752395", "6304071876", "6300268748"], "bought_together": ["B00006C7G9"], "also_viewed": ["0792151712", "6301792734", "0792837614", "B00003CXXO", "6303109950", "6304117752", "6303402348", "6303168507", "B00003CXTF", "B000RC7QVC", "0783221347", "078323662X", "630018627X", "6304151306", "0783230095", "6304233639", "B0000040EJ", "6303187064"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 269908}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 0.5, "brand": "", "asin": "B00000K3AM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4143F912CXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Saving Private Ryan [VHS]"}

{"description": "In 1999, 2 million people around the world voted to name the best baseball players of the 20th century. Preceding the All-Star Game in Fenway Park in July 1999, the All-Century Team took center stage in a rousing ceremony. Among the legends stood Bob Gibson, Mike Schmidt, Willie Mays, Brooks Robinson, and Mark McGwire. Never before or after has so much talent gathered in one place, turning Fenway into a \"veritable field of dreams.\" Narrated by Bob Costas,The All-Century Teamvideo is a touching tribute to the many talented individuals who made baseball the sport it is today. Costas takes us through each position, giving us the background and achievements of the selected elite. Historical accounts paint a picture of the competitors of yesteryear, including Honus Wagner, who batted over .300 for 16 straight seasons--when the league average was .248. Or Sandy Koufax, who started in eight World Series games, finishing with an ERA below one. Other honorable mentions go to Walter Johnson, whose slingshot sidearm motion redefined power pitching, causing one peer to state, \"You can't hit what you can't see.\" Interviews with former players and colleagues flesh out the stories behind these heroic icons, as does vintage game footage that reminds us how talented these men were. By exploring the lives of the greatest players, this video teaches us that baseball is not about one man, but about many legendary players whose remarkable achievements tell the story of the game. It will be interesting to see who makes the All-Century Team for the 21st century.--Jeremy Storey", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 704365}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.49, "brand": "", "asin": "B00001O2GY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71F68FXR9HL._SY300_.gif", "title": "Major League Baseball - All Century Team [VHS]"}

{"description": "The premise ofWicked Cityhas been used in a number of other anime features, includingLegend of the Overfiend: Earth is linked to a parallel world of demons, whose inhabitants can cross the barrier separating the planets. Dashing Taki Renzaburo, a secret agent assigned to handle invaders from the \"Black World,\" finds himself partnered with Makie, a gorgeous Black World woman. Their assignment: to protect Giuseppe Mayart, a bigwig coming to Tokyo to sign a 500-year peace treaty between the worlds. Mayart, who typifies the sniggering, diminutive lechers who often turn up in anime, hardly seems to warrant all this bother. Protecting him draws Taki and Makie into a series of exceedingly violent encounters with \"radicals\" from the Black World who oppose the treaty, including their shape-shifting, unkillable leader and a spider-woman with fanged genitalia. Blood and gore fly amid scenes of rape, torture, shootings, slashings, and exploding bodies. Yoshiaki Kawajiri directs skillfully, although the simian Mayart never blends into the realistic world of the film.Wicked Citywas a landmark work when it was released in 1987, and it retains a cult following. But many subsequent features--notably Mamoru Oshii's darkly brilliantGhost in the Shell--have eclipsed it.

Tolkien's classicThe Lord of the Rings,  but this robust adaptation maintains reverent allegiance to Tolkien's creation,  instantly qualifying as one of the greatest fantasy films ever made. At 178  minutes, it's long enough to establish the myriad inhabitants of Middle-earth,  the legendary Rings of Power, and the fellowship of hobbits, elves, dwarves, and  humans--led by the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and the brave hobbit Frodo  (Elijah Wood)--who must battle terrifying forces of evil on their perilous  journey to destroy the One Ring in the land of Mordor. Superbly paced, the film  is both epic and intimate, offering astonishing special effects and production  design while emphasizing the emotional intensity of Frodo's adventure. Ending on  a perfect note of heroic loyalty and rich anticipation, this wondrous fantasy  continues inThe Two Towers(2002).--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JKZV", "B00005JKZY", "B00BEZTMFY", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B005COPWZW", "B00005JM5E", "B002ZG980U", "B002PMV9FG", "B001GZ6QC4", "B007K3JFUQ", "B000U7WV1Y", "B00005JNJV", "B001OQCV6A", "B004M1A21K", "B008UZ7MYY", "B00HFFE8HE", "B000A9QKLO", "B000E8M0VA", "B000W7F5SS", "B0014C2FX8", "0618640150", "B001DHXT20", "B00E5I2M6I", "B00003CX5P", "B0013FDM7E", "B00AZMFJYA", "B00005QZWI", "B0019L770A", "B000I0RQVI", "B002IPFWTE", "B001CDR1FG", "B0006UEVT0", "B003TT2X6S", "B001OQCV2E", "B009JBWOU0", "B00005JL78", "B00005JNOG", "B001UV4XHY", "B00CNW9ZI6", "B00GKOJ98E", "0345325818", "B0014Z4ON4", "B000H30B2C", "B005LXQLRW", "B001UV4XIS", "B001GCUO1Q", "B00CZDLGDU", "0345538374", "B004LWZW42", "B007REV4T8", "B000W746GK", "B00005JPH2", "B003TT2X72", "B004LWZWGA", "B0087ZG7J8", "B005G4TJUC", "B003ZK99NQ", "B00006HBUJ", "B008UZA8FY", "B0090SI56Y", "B000VI70QS", "B00005JNC2", "B004WCTLNY", "B0014Z4OMU", "6305313687", "B004AKCME8", "B000E6EK2Y", "0547928211", "B000LC55F2", "B0002KVUKM", "B000FQJAIW", "B008JFUO72", "B000FIMG68", "B005LAIHSG", "B005LAIIT4", "B004AOECXI", "B00029RTCG", "B000P0J0EM", "B002HWRYJE", "B0060FXDCG", "B001ECQ75A", "0792839749", "B00AEFXZJE", "B005LAII0I", "B0042U94UQ", "B001HN6918", "B00008G8M5", "B008JFURII", "B003ZKBELG", "B000P0J09W", "B003XURDAY", "B00335EQ0E", "B00008G8M4", "0547928203", "B000W796OM", "B00006ADD5", "B00J49R1BY", "B00B04NIZO", "B00G5G7EXY", "B00001ZWUS"], "bought_together": ["B00005JKZV", "B00005JKZY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00HFFE8HE", "B00005JKZY", "B00BEZTMFY", "B00005JKZV"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 3641}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.49, "brand": "NEW Line Home Video", "asin": "B00003CWT6", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Dj%2BQ1hLBL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)"}
{"description": "Before it ever arrived in the U.S., this epic, animated 1997 fantasy had already made history as the top-grossing domestic feature ever released in Japan, where its combination of mythic themes, mystical forces, and ravishing visuals tapped deeply into cultural identity and contemporary, ecological anxieties. For international animation andanimefans,Princess Mononokerepresents an auspicious next step for its revered creator, Hayao Miyazaki (My Neighbor Totoro,Kiki's Delivery Service), an acknowledgedanimepioneer, whose painterly style, vivid character design, and stylized approach to storytelling take ambitious, evolutionary steps here.Set in medieval Japan, Miyazaki's original story envisions a struggle between nature and man. The march of technology, embodied in the dark iron forges of the ambitious Tatara clan, threatens the natural forces explicit in the benevolent Great God of the Forest and the wide-eyed, spectral spirits he protects. When Ashitaka, a young warrior from a remote, and endangered, village clan, kills a ravenous, boar-like monster, he discovers the beast is in fact an infectious \"demon god,\" transformed by human anger. Ashitaka's quest to solve the beast's fatal curse brings him into the midst of human political intrigues as well as the more crucial battle between man and nature.Miyazaki's convoluted fable is clearly not the stuff of kiddie matinees, nor is the often graphic violence depicted during the battles that ensue. If some younger viewers (or less attentive older ones) will wish for a diagram to sort out the players, Miyazaki's atmospheric world and its lush visual design are reasons enough to watch. For the English-language version, Miramax assembled an impressive vocal cast including Gillian Anderson, Billy Crudup (as Ashitaka), Claire Danes (as San), Minnie Driver (as Lady Eboshi), Billy Bob Thornton, and Jada Pinkett Smith. They bring added nuance to a very different kind of magic kingdom. Recommended for ages 12 and older.--Sam Sutherland", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JLEU", "B000CDGVOE", "B0001XAPZ6", "B002ZTQV8Y", "B002ZTQVHK", "B002ZTQVLG", "B004CRR9G0", "B002ZTQVGQ", "B006LLY8LY", "B0001XAPY2", "B0006J28BO", "B005LAIGX2", "B00CSYR432", "B000CDGVOO", "B004CRR9EW", "B0009MAO3W", "B00BEYYEJ4", "B00BEYYEIK", "B00ENNO1E6", "B00CSYRHG6", "B007JNTOBC", "B008XEZXRA", "B002ZTQVBQ", "B00ENNBZ68", "B007JNTPSO", "B00ENNUC9Y", "6304493681", "B005LAIGXM", "B00CJ7Y0US", "B00B1RB942", "B00441GYS8", "B00ENNA62W", "B00102FF7U", "B008XEZXYI", "B0009MAO3M", "B00AUJH32E", "B0023S49YU", "B000VWYJ68", "B003NF97M6", "B0030ZOYHC", "B009AVC922", "B000TGCR3I", "B001XUTVLK", "B0009P42S2", "B00D44IQQE", "B001DXPWO2", "B005OK0YUC", "B007DBM40S", "B00EJYAWS8", "B004GZZH6W", "0061478784", "B0001EFTVA", "B004R0MF0M", "B004EC5IUW", "B0049TC8AI", "B00CJ7Y19I", "B001CZJP0S", "B002NUULNG", "B0049TC8C6", "B000CEV3O6", "078886145X", "B000A2LV4W", "B009AVCAJ4", "B007V9ECV6", "B004DMIISM", "B008YRL7JE", "1421550644", "1421561042", "B008D1RCKY", "B00B1RB9AQ", "B00AQ7DWCK", "B000VWYJ5Y", "B00B6DTFOC", "B00G5SBI1Q", "B009RZ890M", "B000058A7J", "B00CU6WC94", "B004DMIIPA", "B0043988G2", "B000YAA68W", "B005W2BWEO", "B008D1RDIU", "B002Y0KR66", "B008NNY9YE", "B008XEZXXE", "B00BQ1DDUG", "B00CU6WBOU", "B002KPIO4C", "B00BLQRFQY", "B00GS1GWRU", "B000B8I9XQ", "B00576U9JE", "B00CU6WC8K", "B007DCE5UO", "B000F6ZIFQ", "B000IZGBW8", "B0035RWG0M"], "bought_together": ["B00005JLEU", "B000CDGVOE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002ZTQV8Y", "B00005JLEU", "B00ENNO1E6", "B002ZTQVGQ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 937}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 13.99, "brand": "Buena Vista", "asin": "B00003CXBK", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51KXTH5HPHL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Princess Mononoke"}
{"description": "In its third foray into animated features, DreamWorks came up with something unfortunate: the routine animated picture. Plagued with production problems (it was originally conceived as a mold-breaking PG-13 adventure), the likable film is a Hope/Crosby-style road picture about two scalawags who stumble upon the Latin American paradise of El Dorado, the mythical city with riches of gold. Kenneth Branagh and Kevin Kline are quite fun as Miguel and Tuilo, two Spanish con artists who are shipwrecked in the New World with a scene-stealing horse. The pair follow a map to the secret city where their loyalty will be tested: do they return home rich men or continue to live in this paradise? Of course there are some obstacles: a high priest (Armand Assante) is locked in a power struggle with the benevolent chief (Edward James Olmos) and the perfunctory girlfriend (Rosie Perez) puts the two friends at odds. Like too many of the animated features of its time,The Road to El Doradoimpresses only on a visual level (it's drenched in gorgeous greens and golds). The story and Elton John's songs are quite forgettable; only Branagh and Kline's playful banter keeps the film alive. The PG rating is for some bare backsides and a suggestion of off-screen sex that should soar right over the little ones' heads. Slick and light, it's a fine 83-minute entertainment for ages 5 and up, including the nondiscriminating adult.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005RDVV", "B00004YNUH", "B00003CXQX", "0783236689", "6305229449", "B000035Z2S", "6300275310", "B0000C8ASG", "0788805843", "B00005JLR1", "155890641X", "0788802194", "6302642248", "B00005JL95", "6303534422", "0788805533", "6302526574", "B000028U3S", "B00003CXJ3", "6304401132", "B00016JF2W", "6304290888", "6303314015", "6303392350", "B00005JKDQ", "B0007A2GSM", "B0000AQZYM", "6305326940", "B000035Z46", "B00000ICHA", "B00000I7Q3", "6300274268", "B0006JMLT8", "6302787068", "6303122647", "6305940932", "6304873441", "B0000E32WB", "6303206204", "0788806270", "B0009ZHJ82", "B00006IUM9", "0788803743", "B000089G5P", "B00005T7H1", "B00029LO18", "B00000ICHI", "6305319138", "B000BAVLYI", "B0002YLCHE", "B00005JKX3", "6302320402", "6304978286", "0792839420", "6302481805", "B00003CXXI", "B000063V8N", "6304434340", "6303326781", "B00005LL26", "B0000524CZ", "6304155972", "B00003CXQ0", "0788811002", "6305177473", "B00004R99N", "B00006CXK5", "B00000JYLP", "B00001IVFU", "6303991408", "B00005JMQY", "B00008Y47S", "B00006G8LB", "B00003CXHR", "B00005JKYF", "B00000J2JA", "B00003CXQ6", "B00008G9B8", "6304089627", "0792839129", "6303486894", "0783230095", "B00000GUNY", "B00007AJLB", "B00005MEP8", "B00004WG2B", "B00003CXDU", "630018403X", "B00005JLET", "B0000CABL6", "B00005LKLF", "1560395737", "6305093016", "B00005QATG", "0790720434", "B00005LOUS", "0788812181", "6301017129", "B0006432SW"], "bought_together": ["B00005RDVV", "B00003CXQX"], "also_viewed": ["B00003CXJ3", "B00000I7Q3", "B0000C8ASG", "B0006JMLT8", "B00003CXQX", "B00000GUNY", "B00005JMQY", "6304089767", "0783230095", "B00006IUM9", "B00003CXDU", "B00003CXXI", "B000035Z2S", "B00005RDVV", "B00006CXK5", "0788805533", "B00004YNUH", "6304089201", "0788805843", "6305229449", "B00016JF2W", "6302320402", "B00000JGOQ", "B00005JKDQ", "0783236689", "B0044RFTCE", "6303314015", "B0030IIZ4M", "0788812807", "B0039N74CW", "B0000524CZ", "6305942285", "6304873441", "6303939015", "0788806270", "B00006G8LB", "B00005JLR1", "6303983812", "B00EZH0BXA", "B00004YNUM", "6302787068", "6302642248", "B000035Z46", "6304978286", "6305940932", "B00003CXHR", "B0007A2GSM", "0792839129", "B000028U3S", "B00005LL26", "B00003CX7L", "B00AFEX83C", "6303036813", "078881172X", "B00005JN4W", "6304400551", "B0000D14JV", "155890641X", "6301792734"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 120057}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.95, "brand": "", "asin": "B00003CXG6", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Y2FMMYXFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Road to El Dorado [VHS]"}

{"description": "Men of Honorpresents a great role model for younger viewers, yet it's rated R due to abundant use of theFword. With appropriate discretion, parents should allow their preteen and teenaged children to see this rousing if altogether conventional biopic inspired by the life of Carl Brashear. Played with gravity and gumption by Cuba Gooding Jr., Brashear was the first African American to become a master diver in the U.S. Navy, despite the lingering effects of segregation, opposition from Navy brass, and the amputation of his left leg following a tragic on-duty accident. Robert De Niro adds marquee value and salty bluster as Billy Sunday, the drunken, redneck (and fictionalized) Master Chief who watches, with gradual admiration, as Brashear attains his ultimate goal through sheer force of will.This is all quite uplifting on its surface, but in attempting to hit the requisite highlights of an inspiring biography, director George Tillman Jr. (Soul Food) reduces Brashear's achievement to a succession of clich&eacute;s, forcing Gooding and De Niro to battle sentiment with their noteworthy performances. As Sunday's neglected wife, Charlize Theron is completely extraneous; Hal Holbrook's diving-school commander is a ranting caricature; and newcomer Aunjanue Ellis barely registers as Brashear's wife (in part because their obligatory romance is handled with an utter lack of finesse). There's no question that Brashear's efforts are heroic and worthy of recognition, soMen of Honorserves its basic purpose. Still, one can't help but wonder if Brashear's story would be even more impressive with a more authentic treatment.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000KF0GWW", "B00005B6JZ", "B000F6IODE", "B00005JLRZ", "B00003CXGV", "6304765258", "1558908315", "B0007KIFGE", "B00319ECI8", "B00005JA9F", "B00125WAWS", "B0006L0L5C", "B000P0J0C4", "B000056VP4", "0790736411", "B000065U1N", "B005LAIGN2", "B00AEFYRP0", "B002NZK5VO", "B003ASLJOU", "B0002WZTOI", "B00005JPBO", "0790732238", "6305432317", "B00003CXHJ", "B00005N5S3", "B002VWNICM", "B002AT8K9W", "B002VECM6S", "B00067BCBI", "B00008EY60", "B00000G3PA", "B005LAIGYQ", "B00005JKTP", "B002D755AI", "B000095WW8", "B00AEFY5B6", "B0045HCJHQ", "B00AEFXOKO", "B00AEBB9NM", "B00003CXTG", "B000P0J0EM", "B00008K76U", "B00AEBBA36", "B00005JK8K", "B000KGGIZK", "0800177967", "B00026ZD04", "B000EXZFCQ", "B00003CXFV", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00004XPPG", "B004SIP7ZS", "0792159659", "B000E8QVWY", "B00005PJ8L", "B00AEFYENK", "B00005JLSB", "B00008L3S6", "B000P0J0CE", "B00001ZWUS", "B000P0J09C", "B0006GAOJA", "0451409744", "6304711891", "B00AEFYUQQ", "B00E8G5HZ0", "B002GHHHPQ", "B00441GZ1Y", "B000JYW5BE", "B00005Y1UX", "B001FB55L2", "0790730979", "0783226845", "0783240295", "B00004W221", "0783225733", "B00005JKWX", "B00G4Q3KOC", "B0045HCJ8K", "B00HLTD3ZW", "6305213305", "B00AEFXT1S", "B000SFOW8I", "B000EHSVSC", "B0006IIOHC", "B001QERPAC", "B000P0J0EW", "B004AOECXI", "0780631684", "B00HZMZ2FE", "B00096S49Y", "B0000542CK", "B000066HAS", "B000A2UBN4", "B0043X1FL8", "B00005JNQA", "B000059TFO", "B00003CXTM"], "bought_together": ["B000KF0GWW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00003CXRP", "B005LAIHXQ", "B00DV2MVWO", "B000KF0GWW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 125288}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.99, "brand": "TCFHE", "asin": "B00003CXPP", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516WESMCF3L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Men of Honor"}

{"description": "To callPearl Harbora throwback to old-time war movies is something of an understatement. Director Michael Bay's epic take on the bombing that brought the United States into World War II hijacks every war movie situation and clich&#xE9; (some affectionate, some stale) you've ever seen and gives them a shiny, glossy spin until the whole movie practically gleams. Planes glisten, water sparkles, trees beckon--and Bay's re-creation of the bombing itself, a 30-minute sequence that's tightly choreographed and amazingly photographed, sets the action movie bar up quite a few notches. And in updating the classic war film, Bay and screenwriter Randall Wallace (Braveheart) use that old plot standby, the love triangle--this time, it's between two pilots (Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett) and a nurse (Kate Beckinsale) who find themselves stationed at Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, during what they thought would be a nice, sunny tour of duty. Then, of course, history intervened.For the first 90 minutes of the movie, Affleck and Beckinsale find a nice, appealing chemistry that plays on his strengths as a movie star and hers as a serious actress--he gives her glamour, she gives him smarts. Their truncated romance--the beginning of which is told in flashback so we can get right to the point where he has to leave her to go to England--works, thanks to their charm. They're no Kate and Leo fromTitanic(a strategy the film strives hard toward), but they're pretty darn adorable in their own right. Hartnett, as the not entirely unwelcome third wheel, squints bravely but makes only a slight dent in the film. Everyone else inPearl Harbor--from Cuba Gooding Jr.'s brave navy seaman to Jon Voight's able impersonation of FDR--is pretty much a glorified walk-on, taking a backseat to the pyrotechnics and action sequences that keep the three-hour film in fairly constant motion. But when that action does take hold,Pearl Harboris quite a thrilling ride.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792151712", "B000059HGY", "B00000K3AN", "B00AEBBA36", "0792133153", "079212569X", "6305169187", "6301734734", "0792147618", "0792116887", "6304618344", "079213690X", "6303269834", "6304925131", "6305718792", "6304259131", "B00004WIDB", "6304935811", "6303057225", "6304143184", "6302250269"], "bought_together": ["B00000K3AN", "B00AEBBA36"], "also_viewed": ["B00000G3PA", "0792151712", "6300213668", "B00000JS61", "6303215734", "6303402348", "B00004WIDB", "079213690X", "6305750750", "B004751DFU", "B00005O893", "B00000K3AN", "6301792734", "B00E5I2MCM", "6305169187", "B00007LVCM", "B007SPPANM", "B00L4K3MLE", "B00FLML7HW", "B008QZ5PY2", "B00JBGWP3Y"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 234413}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.49, "brand": "", "asin": "B00003CXTF", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HC1ZDJN6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]"}

Writer/director/producer Peter M. Cohen aspires to make a witty and insightful comedy about the battle of the sexes and instead wallows in soggy clich&eacute;s. Three friends meet every Sunday morning at a diner to discuss the weekend's \"exploits.\" Two fancy themselves to be master scam artists, the other is a compulsive masturbator. All three meet and fall in love with the same woman, Mia (Amanda Peet,The Whole Nine Yards). The truth is swiftly discovered, but none of them want to give her up, so she dates them all while their friendship crumbles. The plot occasionally stops so that one of the characters can talk to the camera and espouse supposed scamster philosophies, and there are \"hilarious\" slapstick episodes, like when one of them drops Mia's vibrator down the toilet and spatters himself with urine trying to retrieve it. The dialogue is idiotic, the actors are charmless, the situations are labored beyond belief--and the filmmaker adores all of it, dwelling lovingly on every inane moment. Ghastly.

Natasha Henstridge (Species) is Melanie Ballard, a headstrong police lieutenant on Mars in the year 2025.

{"description": "WithThe Return of the King, the greatest fantasy epic in film history draws to a grand and glorious conclusion. Director Peter Jackson's awe-inspiring adaptation of the Tolkien classicThe Lord of the Ringscould never fully satisfy those who remain exclusively loyal to Tolkien's expansive literature, but as a showcase for physical and technical craftsmanship it is unsurpassed in pure scale and ambition, setting milestone after cinematic milestone as the brave yet charmingly innocent Hobbit Frodo (Elijah Wood) continues his mission to Mordor, where he is destined to destroy the soul-corrupting One Ring of Power in the molten lava of Mount Doom. While the heir to the kingdom of Men, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), endures the massive battle at Minas Tirith with the allegiance of the elf Legolas (Orlando Bloom), dwarf Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) and the great wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen), Frodo and stalwart companion Samwise Gamgee (Sean Astin) must survive the schizoid deceptions of Gollum, who remains utterly convincing as a hybrid of performance (by Andy Serkis) and subtly nuanced computer animation.Jackson and cowriters Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens have much ground to cover; that they do so with intense pacing and epic sweep is impressive enough, but by investing greater depth and consequence in the actions of fellow Hobbits Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd), they ensure thatReturn of the Kingmaintains the trilogy's emphasis on intimate fellowship. While several major characters appear only briefly, and one (Christopher Lee's evil wizard, Saruman) relegated entirely to the extended version on DVD, Jackson is to be commended for his editorial acumen; like Legolas the archer, his aim as a filmmaker is consistently true, and he remains faithful to Tolkien's overall vision. IfReturnsuffers from too many endings, as some critic suggested, it's only because the epic's conclusion is so loyally inclusive of the actors--most notably Astin--who gave it such strength to begin with. By ending theLOTRtrilogy with noble integrity and faith in the power of imaginative storytelling,The Return of the King, like its predecessors, will stand as an adventure for the ages.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JKZV", "B00003CWT6", "B00BEZTMFY", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B002ZG980U", "B002PMV9FG", "B008UZA8FY", "B001NGML48", "B00005JM5E", "B001GZ6QC4", "B005COPWZW", "B008M4C1EO", "B00HFFE8HE", "039548930X", "B000W7F5SS", "B000I0RQVI", "B002VWNIDG", "B000E6EK2Y", "B001BYMX4A", "B004M1A21K", "B007K3JFUQ", "B001DHXT20", "B001UV4XHY", "0345325818", "B003Y5H54W", "B00005JNJV", "B00E5I2M6I", "B000A3XY5A", "B004LWZWGA", "B000U7WV1Y", "B005LXQLRW", "B001OQCV6A", "B000E8M0VA", "B004SIP8ZM", "B000EHRVMY", "0618640150", "B003ZK99NQ", "B0013FDM7E", "B00005JPH2", "B000UNYK4E", "B009JBWOU0", "B00003CX5P", "B00008G8M5", "B00GKOJ98E", "B004LWZW42", "B000H30B2C", "B000P0J0C4", "B00CZDLGDU", "B000M341QE", "B00008G8M4", "B000FKO5QK", "B00HWWUQYY", "B007SPPANM", "B008JFUO72", "B001DJLD1M", "0345538374", "B00AEFY5B6", "B00005JKCH", "B004SIP9U6", "B000YGGNMO", "B00E5I2M9K", "0618126988", "B005OCFGTO", "B00E8S2JZ4", "6305313687", "B004AKCME8", "B0002KVUKM", "B000AARKOO", "B0006GAO5Y", "B000K7VHQ4", "B002ZG997C", "B00AHTYI5M", "B008JFUS0U", "B0042MEQVG", "B00275EGWY", "B00E9PMML2", "B008UZDXEW", "B004SIP7F8", "B00116GEJS", "B00003CXI1", "B003ZKBELG", "B003Y5H5EW", "B000V4UFZK", "B0007PLLBU", "B001DTPZNY", "B002O3Z50Q", "B001GCUO1Q", "B000LP6KNU", "B005G4TJUC", "B00AW0KHTM", "B002ZG97YM", "054792819X", "B00AEFXZJE", "B0000YEEGM", "B002IPFWTE", "B001ECQ75A", "B000065U1N", "B0051MKNV8", "B000W796OM", "B00J49R1BY"], "bought_together": ["B00005JKZV", "B00003CWT6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00HFFE8HE", "B00003CWT6", "B00005JKZV", "B00BEZTMFY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 1589}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.49, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00005JKZY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HS7iSFv5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)"}
{"description": "Pop idol Britney Spears stars in this sweet coming-of-age movie about  three childhood friends who've grown apart, but find out they may still  have a lot in common. After graduating from high school, Lucy (Spears),  Kit (Zoe Saldana), and Mimi (Taryn Manning) decide to take a road trip to  L.A. to audition for a record label. Along the way, there's a lot of  heartbreak and female bonding (not to mention a lot of midriff-baring--in  her first scene, Spears jumps on her bed in her underwear, singing along  to a Madonna song), as each of the three girls learns more about herself  and life.Crossroadscould have been trite schmaltz, but the script  has some grit and the direction is fresh and relaxed--and, most  significantly, Spears is far more sympathetic and engaging than you might  expect.

{"description": "With its disturbing images and a few good shocks,The Ringis the kind of frightfest you'll watch to set a chilling mood or spook your susceptible friends, but when you try to sort it out, this well-mounted American remake (of the 1998 Japanese hitRingu, based on Koji Suzuki's popular novel) becomes a batch of incoherent parts. The negligible plot follows a Seattle reporter (Naomi Watts) as she investigates the death of her niece, the victim of a mysterious videotape that, according to urban legend, causes the viewer's death seven days later. (Fear Dot Comborrowed the same idea while avoiding this film's lofty pretensions.) The countdown structure follows the reporter, her son, and her estranged boyfriend into deepening layers of terror--all quite effective until the movie attempts to explain itself. At that you're better off shutting down your brain and letting the creepy visuals take over.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0009X763M", "B0006SGYL0", "B004SIP92O", "B00001QGUM", "B00151QYOO", "B001P3SA9Y", "B009XTF8KQ", "B004LWZW24", "B00004BZIY", "B0021L8UFI", "B001JNNDJM", "B000V4UFZK", "B000PMLJMQ", "B0021L8UPS", "B000TJ6PBK", "B0019X3YX2", "B00005RHGK", "B00BEIYMAG", "B0026LQM2Q", "B00005JNJR", "B003UGLCIA", "B000IHY9TS", "B002VWNIDG", "B00AIBZLVY", "B00AEBBA2W", "B00006FDCD", "B008JFUNYG", "B00EZ50SGW", "B00B96TGQS", "B00005JL3T", "B000BTJDGC", "B00AJLHUA8", "B000OVLBGM", "B000RIWAVW", "B003VA3JUO", "B00DW5IM14", "B00005JNY3", "B0021L8UXA", "B00008LUNW", "B000F6IOAM", "B001D2WU9I", "B002JT69IW", "B000AA4JL6", "B00174RCHW", "B00AQJ8MLY", "B00386EZUY", "B0000VCZMK", "B00018D42W", "B0000E2R6P", "B0006SSOHC", "B001U0HBQA", "B00004TS0G", "B003L20IEW", "B008F283VS", "B001DJLD1W", "B0053TWVDC", "B00007G1ZB", "B0015ET3YO", "B00011CZRE", "B004LWZW2O", "B002ZG971U", "B000088NQR", "B002LMSWN2", "B00AEFXSLE", "B0000648X0", "B00005JOWW", "B00005JNNT", "B0031U8OEK", "B006CXIKYC", "B001MVYUR0", "B004SIP9P6", "B003UN0752", "B001NPD9LS", "B008WAM2E2", "B001B1UO6W", "B000GBEWRU", "B00AZTUUQK", "B0002DB54A", "B004SIP9O2", "0780631684", "B003LR5BD0", "B000GCFO0I", "B000VKL6Z2", "B005CFBYW6", "B008G33PIM", "B000GSYRY6", "B0010X73ZG", "B000AM4P9K", "B000A5045Q", "B000056T5E", "B005TK23PQ", "B004BLJQOK", "0783116926", "B001DZOC6Y", "B00BEIYG98", "B005LAIGOQ", "B0097C046W", "B0013FDM7E", "B00BEIYGT8", "B0001FR3IQ"], "bought_together": ["B0009X763M", "B0006SGYL0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004LWZW24", "B000V4UFZK", "B00BEIYMAG", "B00005JNY3"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 99771}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.79, "brand": "Dreamworks Skg", "asin": "B00005JLTK", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51MKWPKHSTL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Ring (Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "Outstanding picture and sound plus tons of features makeCharlie's Angels: Full Throttlea fully loaded DVD.  Don't expect more T&A; in the unrated edition, however.  The only difference is glimpses of more intense violence in a few of the fight scenes.  For example, in the theatrical version you'll see an angel flying through the air, but in the unrated version you'll then see her lying expressionless on the ground.  Also, blood flies out of Drew Barrymore's mouth in one scene.  On his commentary track, director McG discusses inside jokes, visual effects, and shots that didn't quite work for him.  Like a TV sportscaster, he uses a telestrator, but only to occasionally circle items of interest or draw arrows.  There's also an amusing commentary track by the three writers, who chuckle over inside jokes and discuss how the film was changed from the original script.  They preface their comments with: \"I guess they asked us to do this just to prove that writers worked on this movie.\"  \"Who are we kidding?  Who's listening to this right now?\"If you want still more info, there's a trivia track with pop-up factoids with occasional links to more featurettes, a jukebox that offers clips of 11 songs and explanations of why they were picked, a cameo-graphy that offers clips of 13 personalities and why we should know them, and eight 4- to 18-minute featurettes exploring such topics as stunts, vehicles, costumes, and the Pussycat Dolls dance troupe.  And in the next evolution of product placement, the DVD-ROM \"Shop the Scene\" feature allows you to search for a character's outfit or gadget then buy it online.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002A5EBMQ", "B00164EAGY", "B00003CXZ1", "B00AEFYGBA", "B000069HYG", "B0000SX9N2", "B00005JL8Z", "B00004ZDO9", "B008H6GHII", "B000UDGOC0", "B007AFC0RY", "B0006L0LOS", "B000085EFK", "B0007P0Y7C", "B00003CXMP", "B00024JC4E", "B00016MSV2", "B0007PLLBU", "B001C5LLQ4", "B00005MEVO", "B000BKJ758", "B000MX7V70", "B000035Z3G", "B002GHHHL0", "B000LC3ICE", "B000FDFSH2", "B0006GANPA", "B000Y11BC6", "B000AP04FG", "B00026ZG10", "B0041KKYGU", "B00005JMUA", "0767819640", "B0018PH3KQ", "B00008G7UI", "B00BLN4V0A", "B002GOAH1A", "B00006HAWN", "B0001BS3IE", "B0009RCPUW", "B002ZG984Q", "B001EDVNNU", "B000VI70QS", "B004LWZW2O", "B000A343RI", "B0006FO8E8", "B000EGDB10", "B000RW3VCU", "B00005JN4H", "B00BTYMPUY", "B00005J761", "B000CEXGAU", "B005TK0MFE", "B0041ONFOE", "B000VG66XS", "B00ID8H98C", "B00007AJF5", "B00AEFXO8Q", "B0009W5JR8", "B008JFURII", "B00001PE4D", "B000M7FOO8", "B004P7CN7W", "B0000DZ6N3", "B00005JM5B", "B00007GZRP", "B000ARXF96", "B0018CNNV2", "B000CCW2P2", "B0009KA2OA", "B002O3Z4ZW", "B00006G8JD", "B0008FXT1Y", "B0000524E5", "B002GSXKOW", "B00005JM55", "B003Q6D2B4", "B005CFBYW6", "B00008WJD6", "B000ENC5YW", "B003FCKI3O", "B005Z9MFRC", "B00004STVN", "B00005JG6N", "B00E1HIXEI", "B0007OCG56", "B00005JMEW", "B000BTIU4S", "B00008WJEZ", "B000NIBURQ", "B000EQ5V8G", "B0001Z37HM", "B003PIUINS", "B00005JMW7", "B00196UTEG", "B000A2IPQY", "B004SIP6VI", "B00005JLZW", "B00005JNTU", "B00AEFXCLU"], "bought_together": ["B002A5EBMQ", "B00AEFYGBA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002A5EBMQ", "B0000CABE5", "B000069HYG", "B008JFUUIA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 26650}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.9, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B00005JLYW", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51L5TYVcBmL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle (Unrated Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "All on a single disc,The League of Extraordinary Gentlemenoffers two commentary tracks, 12 deleted and extended scenes, and a 54-minute documentary. The track by the two producers and three of the actors is informative, but surprisingly interesting is the track by the film's technicians, particularly costume designer Jacqueline West, whose passion for her craft is infectious.  Unfortunately, the film's two biggest selling points--thegraphic novelthat inspired it and the marquee star, Sean Connery--don't get sufficient attention.  The documentary acknowledges the graphic novel but doesn't really discuss it, concentrating on examinations of the costumes and special effects (e.g., Mr. Hyde was done without CGI).  Connery's involvement consists of a few sound bites at the beginning of some of the documentary chapters.  He and producer Don Murphy explain that he turned downThe Lord of the RingsandThe Matrixbecause he didn't understand them, but even though he wasn't sure he understoodLXG, he wasn't going to turn it down.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0002KVUKM", "B0009MDPYM", "B001AK3S4Y", "B001F7MSFM", "B00AEFXCLU", "B002GOAH1A", "B0006IIPIK", "B0000959N0", "6304711891", "B0007P0Y7C", "B003HKN52U", "B000FGGE68", "B003M987PQ", "B006VRRGNK", "B004EPZ07K", "1558908846", "B0002J4X1Q", "B001DHXT20", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B007K3JFUQ", "B008JFUS0U", "B002GHHHL0", "B000OVLBF8", "B00AEFYGBA", "B00005JNTU", "B001OQCV6A", "B000069I1I", "B001GCUO1Q", "B000ENC5YW", "B0006L0LOS", "B000VI70QS", "B00IKM5LXG", "B003Y5H5EW", "0800195175", "B0090SI56Y", "B00005JLQN", "B00070FX5U", "B005LAIH54", "B002A5EBMQ", "B000B8GT92", "B000MX7V70", "B0045HCJGC", "B000ASATYY", "B001CDR1FG", "B001GCUO0W", "B004LWZW42", "B001VLFE7G", "B004SEUIWY", "B003Q6D2B4", "B00004Z4WR", "B009MF5BXK", "B00151QYXU", "B00003CXSD", "B002GSXKNI", "B005LAIGW8", "B002ZG99KO", "B000035Z38", "0767834739", "B00005JN0T", "B002ZG999U", "B00E5I2MEK", "B00E5I2M9K", "B0013FDM7E", "B002ZG97CO", "B0002IQMAM", "B00BTYOYG2", "B008JFURII", "B008JFUO72", "B0013J55B6", "B001HQZJMU", "B000EQHXN2", "B000OVLBHG", "B009MO57H6", "B000AP04FG", "B00008K76U", "B000WC39LI", "6304712499", "B005LAIHYU", "B008JFUPPI", "B0016Q2D5M", "B00006JDVV", "B00111YM5G", "B00AEFZ6V4", "B000I0RQVI", "B000CEXGAU", "B000056PMU", "B001QTXM5Y", "B0000VJG72", "B005LAIH2C", "B00I9TDMRM", "B00005JM5E", "B00008EYA5", "B002ZG99G8", "B00007AJE1", "B000H30B2C", "B002NXSRVG", "B00195FUDC", "B001QB9H1U", "B0006GANOQ", "B001DJLD1M"], "bought_together": ["B0002KVUKM", "B0009MDPYM"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0002KVUKM", "B00005JLXE", "B001F7MSFM", "B002ZG98LO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 12054}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.68, "brand": "Twentieth Century Fox", "asin": "B00005JM5B", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51KDD84NPVL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (Widescreen Edition)"}

Dr. Tess Coleman (the hilarious Jamie Lee Curtis) and her teenage daughter Anna (rockin' Lindsay Lohan) have one thing in common -- they don't relate to each other on anything. Not clothes or men or Anna's passion to be in a rock band. Nothing. Then one night a little mystic mayhem changes their lives and they wake up to the biggest freak-out ever.

{"description": "More sex. More violence. That's what you get in the unrated director's cut ofTaking Lives, which ought to tell you where director D.J. Caruso's priorities lie. The hot scenes between Angelina Jolie and Ethan Hawke are extended (offering a bit more nudity for Jolie's lecherous fans), and the fate of Gena Rowlands's character isconsiderablymore graphic, but none of the added footage makes the movie any better or worse. That said, this cynical director's cut is the only version worth buying if you're looking to fill out your serial-killer-thriller collection (or your movies-in-which-Jolie-gets-naked collection), and you might as well enjoy the gag reel outtakes because they contain the only footage on the entire DVD in which Jolie cracks a genuine smile. The four featurettes are really just one standard-issue promo reel chopped into thematic categories with a pretentiousCSIvibe, and while they offer little of substance, seasoned film buffs will welcome the appearance of veteran British editor Anne V. Coates, who briefly explains her approach to cutting high-tension scenes. The rest is routine at best, but given the choice between the full-screen DVD and this steamier, more gruesome widescreen version, well, it's no contest.

{"description": "Even though it's only a single disc, the28 Days LaterDVD includes a lot of very interesting features, including the alternate ending that was shown after the end of the film a couple months into its theatrical run.  It's much bleaker, as director Danny Boyle and writer Alex Garland say in their optional commentary.  Another alternate ending is almost the same as the theatrical ending but slightly less happy.  Most interesting is the \"radical\" alternate ending that takes an entirely different path midway through the film.  It wasn't filmed, however, so Boyle and Garland narrate the action over storyboards, and it's a surprisingly engrossing 11 minutes.  Boyle and Garland also did a commentary track for the film, and they talk about how they were able to get the shots of deserted London and why they used the ending they did.  There are also six very watchable deleted scenes, and Boyle and Garland's comments range from \"great sequence\" to \"a disgrace.\" Slightly less relevant is a 24-minute documentary that spends its first 10 minutes on the real-life threat of infectious diseases before recapping the film and discussing such elements as the use of digital video and the boot camp the actors had to attend. If you need any further proof that the DVD was a labor of love, even the stills galleries have commentaries.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000TJBN80", "B0002ABURA", "B0006A9FKA", "B002WY65VU", "B00111YM5Q", "B0013D8LAE", "B000IHY9TS", "B000Y7U98C", "B00005JO16", "B0021L8UXA", "B0001611DI", "B0013D8LA4", "B000RJO56O", "B002JT69IW", "B001D2WU9I", "B002VWNIDG", "B0002CHK1S", "B00D7AM6M0", "B003UGLCIA", "B00AEFYYH6", "B001MVYUR0", "B000UAE7O0", "B003EYVXYG", "B000EHRVP6", "B0028DRGDQ", "B0021L8UPS", "B001NPD9LS", "B005LAIIMG", "B000FAOC2W", "B000LP6KNU", "B0006SSOHC", "B000WC3864", "B0013FDM7E", "B00000K3TO", "B000RIWAVW", "B000GCFO0I", "B000O76ZQC", "B004LWZW24", "B000RJO578", "B002VKB0KG", "B006ISJR7U", "B00004TS0G", "B004SIP9MY", "B002VKE1K2", "B00G5GNYY2", "B000N6TX1I", "B0024FADD8", "B005QUQRBU", "B001MYIXAC", "B00D3DJIG8", "B001GUYB08", "B000TGJ80S", "B000V4UFZK", "B004SIP92O", "B00009MGEM", "B0010X73ZG", "B00005K3NR", "B002LMSWN2", "B000063RQQ", "B00000ILDD", "B004BZ5AN2", "0767802519", "B00001QGUM", "B00AJLHUA8", "B002SJIO4A", "B00005JMUA", "B00J5LXT6M", "B005J9ZFQG", "B000QQJ3Q0", "B000AXWHSA", "B00BEIYMAG", "B00005JLWN", "B004BLJQOK", "B0015ET3YO", "B008220BLG", "B000031WD9", "B000069HZP", "B000EQ5SRK", "B0007Y08QA", "B000PMLJMQ", "B000BUNZY2", "B002ZG98UA", "B000V4UH08", "B001JNNDJM", "B003HKN52U", "B003UAKEBW", "B0007DFJ0G", "B0019X3YX2", "B00CE00ZV8", "B00003CXCF", "B0009WFEDC", "B000FS9FE4", "B00005JNJV", "B00011CZRE", "B002T9H2LA", "B000RW5BZ0", "B00005JMXX", "B000WC389G", "B007STBUHI", "B002ZG983M"], "bought_together": ["B000TJBN80", "B002WY65VU"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B008SAPC20", "B003J42JLC", "B000Y7U98C", "B0002ABURA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 37382}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.25, "brand": "Twentieth Century Fox", "asin": "B00005JMA8", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/511KHM89SFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "28 Days Later (Widescreen Special Edition)"}
{"description": "Like a good dream, Sofia Coppola'sLost in Translationenvelops you with an aura of fantastic light, moody sound, head-turning love, and a feeling of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu, even though you've probably never been to this neon-fused version of Tokyo. Certainly Bob Harris has not. The 50-ish actor has signed on for big money shooting whiskey ads instead of doing something good for his career or his long-distance family. Jetlagged, helplessly lost with his Japanese-speaking director, and out of sync with the metropolis, Harris (Bill Murray, never better) befriends the married but lovelorn 25-year-old Charlotte (played with heaps of poise by 18-year-old Scarlett Johansson). Even before her photographer husband all but abandons her, she is adrift like Harris but in a total entrapment of youth. How Charlotte and Bill discover they are soul mates will be cherished for years to come. Written and directed by Coppola (The Virgin Suicides), the film is far more atmospheric than plot-driven: we whiz through Tokyo parties, karaoke bars, and odd nightlife, always ending up in the impossibly posh hotel where the two are staying. The wisps of bittersweet loneliness of Bill and Charlotte are handled smartly and romantically, but unlike modern studio films, this isn't a May-November fling film. Surely and steadily, the film ends on a much-talked-about grace note, which may burn some, yet awards film lovers who \"always had Paris\" with another cinematic destination of the heart.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305428239", "B0007UC8Y4", "B000BX8R10", "B00005JMJG", "B0000640VJ", "B0010X8NF0", "B003UESJLU", "B007L6VR12", "0767821408", "B00007AJF8", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B00DW5IKYS", "B001QOGYBI", "B000M06KJ8", "B00005JLRE", "B00000G02H", "B0006TPE4C", "B0007TKOAA", "B00AEFXESQ", "B00DYVUBYM", "B00H9HZITU", "B000Z8GZYW", "B004SEUIXS", "B00AEFXN9G", "B003CRM6PA", "B00008RH3J", "B000EQHXNW", "B0001I1K32", "B0008JIJ2O", "B001DJ7PR8", "B0007DFJ0G", "B0009PVZD2", "B000CS464G", "B00337KM2S", "B003102JDM", "0790734796", "B001P3SA8K", "B00JJ3EHCG", "B0000WN0SC", "B00003CWTI", "B00003CXZ4", "B00008975Z", "B0057ZAA6W", "B000IU37SO", "B00004RJ73", "B00AEFXGIY", "B007P9HW3M", "B005MYEQ4U", "B000K7VHQE", "B00005JNC2", "B00079Z9VO", "B000063JDE", "B0001US61O", "B0000WN15O", "B00G7QPXUI", "B0041KKYEM", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00006LPGP", "B0006H32EI", "B00005JKJA", "B00AEFYCL4", "B000KX0IOK", "B002T9H2LA", "B001TOD92C", "B004XVMCKS", "B00AEBB9CS", "B008220DGE", "0767802519", "B000069HYF", "B007D5E7C2", "B000M7XRAG", "B004U7MR14", "B003O7I6SE", "B000A7DVR2", "B005LAIIJY", "B00A81MV3U", "B000055Y0X", "B00005V9HH", "B000E33VWW", "0783225903", "B00AEFXE9U", "B000N6TX1I", "B00CIOD6HK", "B0021L8UOY", "B004SIP95G", "B000PAAJZ6", "B002ZG980U", "B007UW9WOQ", "B00GKOJ98E", "B0014D5RBE", "B00011CZRE", "B001HN699A", "B000M4RG7E", "B003ELKNH2", "0767802535", "B00121QGPY", "B004FQX5B6", "6305609764", "B0009A40ES"], "bought_together": ["B0007UC8Y4", "6305428239"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00JAQJMJ0", "B007L6VR12", "B001QOGYBI", "B0010X8NF0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 2901}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.77, "brand": "Universal Studios", "asin": "B00005JMJ4", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518vLN4%2B7KL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Lost in Translation"}

{"description": "Like any DVD blockbuster from producer Jerry Bruckheimer, the extras are plentiful and often a bit too self-congratulatory (worst offender here is the primary commentary track). The slickly (natch) produced making-of documentary goes through the standard routine; however, the less-flashy \"fly on the wall\" bits--just showing what happens on set without comment--is more fun, offering effortless insight on the filmmaking process. The best treasure is a nifty interactive history on pirates with plenty of background material. You can simply play the filmed segments or take a tour around a ship to discover the material (and a few surprises). There's a lot of archival material on the theme-park ride that inspired the film and several odds and ends including an enjoyable chronicle of the vintage ship's voyage from its home harbor to the movie set. The kids should really dig the DVD-ROM \"Moonlight Becomes Ye,\" in which they can turn their own mug into a ghostly pirate. There's also a bounty of extended and deleted scenes (19 in all) and a very funny blooper reel. With both DTS and Dolby 5.1, sound systems will get a workout with the excellent (and loud) sound design.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000I0RQVI", "B000U7WV1Y", "B005COPWZW", "B004A8ZWUQ", "B00005JN5E", "B0013BM63O", "B006VRRGNK", "B00005JKZV", "B00005JPH2", "B0014Z4OMU", "B00E5I2MCM", "B00003CWT6", "B004DTLK80", "B00005JKZY", "B0000A1RJI", "B004M1A21K", "B004DTLK7G", "B00003CXZ1", "B001HN694K", "B001E75QH0", "B00E5I2M6I", "B00005JKCH", "B0087ZG7HK", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B000E6EK2Y", "B000E8M0VA", "B003UYUQZW", "B00AEFYGBA", "B000W746GK", "B00005JMQW", "B0083SBMBM", "B001DHXT20", "B0002234LS", "B000W7F5SS", "B002PMV9FG", "B0002KVUKM", "B004EPYZUS", "B0053FANRC", "B00BEZTMFY", "6304806434", "B000VR0570", "0783231644", "B001OQCV6A", "B000AYELVA", "B008JFUO72", "B005G4TJUC", "B00004R99S", "B00023B1LC", "B00E5I2M9K", "B00003CXI1", "B001HQZJMU", "B00000IRE6", "B0002ZDVEU", "B008QE9XD2", "B00F84H73Q", "B00E5I2MEK", "B003Y5H5EW", "B007K3JFUQ", "B003QO8TOQ", "B000NQRR1Q", "B000YPUF9W", "B001EZE5BU", "B004A8ZWSS", "B0009MDPYM", "B00LG6YEKE", "B002ZG980U", "B002ZG994U", "B000U1ZV8K", "B001DZ8TRW", "B00005JLR2", "B000VWYJ86", "B00AZMFJYA", "B001GZ6QC4", "B00000JQB5", "B004XKCZAG", "B000W796OM", "B001GCUO0W", "B00AQSN7HE", "B00000ILDH", "B0053FANT0", "B0000VAFO0", "B0002IQMAM", "B000HRMAPE", "B004LWZW7Y", "B008UZA8FY", "B0001HLVS2", "B00007AJGH", "B00005JNJV", "B003YAR97K", "B00CHVJODE", "B000UR9T8C", "B0049IHX2C", "B000G6BLW4", "B00177YA1K", "0783227345", "B0014Z4ON4", "B001TK80C0", "B002O5M4T4", "B00AEBBA72", "B00005JOC9"], "bought_together": ["B000I0RQVI", "B000U7WV1Y"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005COPWZW", "B000I0RQVI", "B0071JADFU", "B00005JPFX"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 6260}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.23, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B00005JM5E", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51fX40gGdXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)"}
{"description": "The seemingly obligatory director's commentary is not on this two-disc set of Michael Mann's slick thriller yet the extras are so good you won't miss it. On the surface, there's nothing out of the ordinary here with the exception of a few minutes of rehearsal footage, but everything is just so darn interesting to watch. Mann and his stars dish about the making of the film, including the creation of Cruise's assassin.

{"description": "The unrated director's cut ofThe Girl Next Doordelivers about half a minute of extra nudity and sexual footage.  Without adding anything to the running time of the R-rated theatrical cut, the unrated edition substitutes steamier footage into the film Eli watches while talking to Matt, and removes some digitized bikinis in part of the strip-club scene.  (The new cut also has a more threatening scene between Matt and Kelly.)  Don't expect to see more of star Elisha Cuthbert, though; she didn't do any nude scenes, as she explains in one of the five scenes she provides commentary for.  Costar Emile Hirsch does his own commentary for three of the same scenes plus one other, but he's less insightful and more prone to gaps of silence than Cuthbert.  Among the other DVD features, director Luke Greenfield adds a feature-length commentary, as well as optional commentary for 11 deleted scenes, four extended scenes, and the original ending.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00260HH1W", "B00AEFZ3XU", "B0023TCWE8", "B00AEFXVW0", "B000Y7U93C", "B001L9EXTS", "B0026BXHQ0", "B00AEFYZCU", "B000IZJZIU", "B000069CF0", "B000E6EHE0", "B002N1C1CO", "B004GTVU6O", "B0009P42WI", "B0051MKNRC", "B002ZGW92E", "B000EMGJAO", "B000BKVQS4", "B000NO39FG", "B00AEFYS2M", "B000CPH9PM", "B004EPZ0BG", "B00007AJGM", "B0012RLX88", "B001OD4S50", "B00316DDUO", "B000WZEZGI", "B004L3AR0K", "B0008JIJ10", "B005LAIH9A", "B004EPZ084", "B0009ZE9VW", "B000LC3ICE", "B000K2V7E6", "B0038N4O26", "B00008K7AM", "B00EON8RHM", "B001O0TWYK", "B001C0JCBA", "B008R65XNS", "B005Z9MFRC", "B0021L8UXA", "B00005V4XV", "B000JJ4DNW", "0767835093", "B0019X3YXM", "B0002JZT5A", "B000VXWX7E", "B004DTLKCG", "B001NPD9PY", "B004SEUJ9Q", "B000ALM4AS", "B004ULEEXY", "B00005KA6V", "B000031WD9", "B006WXHJLC", "B001G5T6GW", "B001J9KJ4I", "B000UUX2QO", "B00IVLRA62", "B004EPYZS0", "B00AEFYCL4", "B00003CXPS", "B003VPX5Y4", "B003Y5H524", "B001CIOCNK", "B000WC38EQ", "B00003CXGJ", "B00JQF7ZR6", "B00IXPQU6M", "B002UJIY7A", "B00AEFYQE2", "B0014DZ2WS", "B001CRC4DG", "B00000F0AD", "B00009ZPUA", "B004SIP9Z6", "B00005JNZU", "B004LWZW5G", "B001MEWBVO", "B00BEIYMZ6", "B00AEFYAMA", "B00005PJ7G", "B0004Z3242", "B0018CNNV2", "B000PMFS2I", "B00441GYVA", "B000K4WPCC", "B0009GX1XI", "B002ZG97XI", "B00004TJMW", "B0000AZT1G", "B00006JMQ4", "B000VNMMR0", "B003L20IHE", "B00004Z4WR", "B00003CXMP", "B000XA5K48", "B000J4QW7W"], "bought_together": ["B00AEFZ3XU", "B0023TCWE8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AEFZ3XU", "B00260HH1W", "B000069CF0", "B005LAIH9A"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 39280}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.55, "brand": "Twentieth Century Fox", "asin": "B00005JMX6", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51lsYGphwoL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Girl Next Door (Unrated Version)"}

{"description": "Batman Beginsdiscards the previous four films in the series and recasts the Caped Crusader as a fearsome avenging angel. That's good news, because the series, which had gotten off to a rousing start under Tim Burton, had gradually dissolved into self-parody by 1997'sBatman & Robin. As the title implies,Batman Beginstells the story anew, when Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) flees Western civilization following the murder of his parents. He is taken in by a mysterious instructor named Ducard (Liam Neeson in another mentor role) and urged to become a ninja in the League of Shadows, but he instead returns to his native Gotham City resolved to end the mob rule that is strangling it. But are there forces even more sinister at hand?Cowritten by the team of David S. Goyer (a veteran comic book writer) and director Christopher Nolan (Memento),Batman Beginsis a welcome return to the grim and gritty version of the Dark Knight, owing a great debt to the graphic novels that preceded it. It doesn't have the razzle dazzle, or the mass appeal, ofSpider-Man 2(though the Batmobile is cool), and retelling the origin means it starts slowly, like most \"first\" superhero movies. But it's certainly the best Bat-film since Burton's original, and one of the best superhero movies of its time. Bale cuts a good figure as Batman, intense and dangerous but with some of the lightheartedness Michael Keaton brought to the character. Michael Caine provides much of the film's humor as the family butler, Alfred, and as the love interest, Katie Holmes (Dawson's Creek) is surprisingly believable in her first adult role. Also featuring Gary Oldman as the young police officer Jim Gordon, Morgan Freeman as a Q-like gadgets expert, and Cillian Murphy as the vile Jonathan Crane.--David HoriuchiBatmanat Amazon.comAllBatmanDVDsBatman Begins101: A Comic Book PrimerWhere Have I Seen Christian Bale?AllBatmanComics and Graphic NovelsBatmanToysBatman BeginsSoundtrackStills fromBatman Begins(click for larger images)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001GZ6QC4", "B004LWZWGA", "B002GSXKN8", "B000P0J06U", "B001OST0LW", "B000P0J06K", "B004EPZ07K", "B00E5I2MCM", "B00005JKCH", "B001GCUO1Q", "B002ZG980U", "B001OST0M6", "B008JFUPFI", "B004LWZWFQ", "B00005JMQW", "B004LWZW42", "B000VI70QS", "B001DHXT20", "B000M341QE", "B0000959N0", "B000UR9T8C", "B00005JNTU", "B000AYELVA", "B00E5I2M6I", "B002IPFWTE", "B000HEVZ9E", "B0090SI56Y", "B002HWRYJE", "B0006L0LOS", "B000OVLBF8", "B00003CWT6", "B000VR0570", "B00E5I2MEK", "B000HCO83Q", "B0007P0Y7C", "B008JFUO72", "B00F4FFO8E", "B001CDR1FG", "B000P0J0EW", "B002T9H2LA", "B0002KVUKM", "B00E5I2M9K", "B00005N5S5", "B0083SBMBM", "B0001BKAEY", "B00AQSN7HE", "B000J10EQU", "B00005JKZY", "B002NXSRVG", "B000AYELVU", "B001OQCV6A", "B004LWZW4M", "B001VLBDD0", "B001GZ6QEC", "B004GJYRA0", "B007REV4T8", "B001TK80C0", "B000HRJLII", "B001QTXM5Y", "B005G4TJUC", "B00005JKZV", "B0053FANT0", "B00005JA8B", "B003YAR97K", "B004SIP9Z6", "B00001ZWUS", "B004EPYZQC", "B001N44BVQ", "B006VRRGNK", "B001AEF6HM", "B00000JQB5", "B00011CZRE", "B00AZMFJYA", "B00AEFY0F2", "B007K3JFUQ", "B0002IQMAM", "B00005JN0T", "B002SJIO4A", "B000VWYJ86", "B0013FDM7E", "B00005JNTI", "B00407PNY2", "B00DTPRZ24", "B008JFUS0U", "B00004Z4WR", "B000FS9FCG", "B000QXDED6", "B0085A9HU6", "0780624890", "B00005LOUK", "B000065U1N", "B000P0J0AG", "B00005JN5T", "B001QB9H1U", "B00005JMUA", "0792844890", "B0007DFJ0G", "B004EPYZSK", "B008JFUOWM", "B00AEFY5B6"], "bought_together": ["B001GZ6QC4", "B004LWZWGA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B009JBWOU0", "B001GZ6QC4", "B004LWZWGA", "B002ZG980U"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 7806}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.99, "brand": "DC Comics", "asin": "B00005JNJV", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518zjc4XtzL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Batman Begins (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)"}

Instead of a mad slasher, however, Spielberg (along with writers Josh Friedman & David Koepp) utilizes aliens hell-bent on quickly destroying humanity, and the terrifying results that prey upon adult fears, especially in the post-9/11 world. The realistic results could be a new genre, the grim popcorn thriller; often you feel like you're watching Schindler's List more than Spielberg's other thrill-machine movies (Jaws,Jurassic Park). The film centers on Ray Ferrier, a divorced father (Tom Cruise, oh so comfortable) who witnesses one giant craft destroy his New Jersey town and soon is on the road with his teen son (Justin Chatwin) and preteen daughter (Dakota Fanning) in tow, trying to keep ahead of the invasion. The film is, of course, impeccably designed and produced by Spielberg's usual crew of A-class talent. The aliens are genuinely scary, even when the film--like the novel--spends a good chunk of time in a basement. Readers of the book (or viewers of the deft 1953 adaptation) will note the variation of whom and how the aliens come to Earth, which poses some logistical problems. The film opens and closes with narration from the novel read by Morgan Freeman, but Spielberg could have adapted Orson Welles's words from the famous Halloween Eve 1938 radio broadcast: \"We couldn't soap all your windows and steal all your garden gates by tomorrow night, so we did the best next thing: we annihilated the world.\"--Doug ThomasWar of the Worldsat Amazon.comThe SoundtrackThe War of the Worlds(1953)War of the Worlds - The Complete First Season(TV series)Classic Sci-Fi Movies and Their RemakesAliens Invade on DVDThe Prog-rock Opera (no kidding)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEBB8VK", "B00005JL78", "B001SGEUYW", "B00008G8M4", "B00005JL3T", "B0013FDM7E", "B00AEFXNLY", "B00005JMXX", "B001OQCV2E", "B000VECAD0", "B002O3Z510", "B0002V7OI8", "B000H30B2C", "B000EGDB10", "B00005JN2Z", "B005LAIIMG", "B005PTYP70", "B002O3Z50G", "B0002V7ON8", "B00005JN0T", "B00K2CHW48", "B002SJIO4A", "0783225547", "B008JFUO36", "B00005JKLZ", "B00AS1Q93S", "1936594056", "B004EPYZUS", "B001TUZG4K", "B00AEFXR1K", "B00001ZWUS", "B00AEFXYJA", "0767817478", "B0034G4ORC", "B003QO8TOQ", "B00070FX5U", "B0045HCJSA", "B00000G3PA", "B005LAIHPE", "B003Y5H5GK", "B00AEBBA72", "B00003CWU3", "B00I9TDMRM", "B001ECDVKE", "B00003CXXP", "B000V4UFZK", "B0010X73ZG", "B001DZOC6Y", "B00005JKFR", "B000XT1P4S", "B003HKN52U", "B0009PW4D2", "B000HRMAPE", "B004EPYZPS", "B0018QPPXW", "B0002WZTOI", "B00AEBB9LO", "B004LWZW4M", "B003ABZHAO", "B003YJFALS", "B0087ZG7HK", "B000OT6V64", "B004P7CN7W", "B000CCBC9O", "B00000ILDD", "0767803434", "B001L57ZYM", "B000065V3G", "B007STBUHI", "B002ZG980U", "B008JFUQZ2", "B00005B6JZ", "B0006GANOQ", "B000F1IQN2", "1494343576", "B001GCUO02", "B00004Y87O", "0783226810", "B004EPYZSK", "B000P0J0BU", "B005LAIHXQ", "B001680M26", "B000EQHXN2", "B0045HCJFS", "B00004BZIY", "B00008G8M5", "B00003CXQA", "B008JFUS0U", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00EIN6KJ0", "B0000DZ6N3", "B000MV8A9A", "B00005JKYX", "B0000YEEGM", "B000TGJ8CQ", "B0013FCWUW", "B002ZG9864", "B00003CWTI", "B008MIMWQW", "B00IKM5OCO"], "bought_together": ["B00AEBB8VK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AEBB8VK", "B004LWZW4M", "B00005JL78", "B004EPYZSK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 18739}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.95, "brand": "Dreamworks Skg", "asin": "B00005JNTI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51upxzPRnXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "War of the Worlds"}

{"description": "In the DVD world, the Criterion Collection label generally indicates that you'll be getting your money's worth on the extras, andThe Life Aquatic with Steve Zissouis no exception. These two discs contain many features that fans of the film will expect: Seu Jorge performing David Bowie songs (complete versions), many documentary scenes of writer-director Wes Anderson at work, interviews with cast members including Cate Blanchett, Bill Murray, etc. Other extras are a little more confusing. For instance, does Seymour Cassel, who plays Zissou's deceased partner, know what he's doing when he complains to a hairless cigar merchant about having to go faux bald? And what's the deal withMondo Monda? It's a cringingly awkward Italian talk show in which the host (also an actor in the film) interviews the screenwriters, throwing out references so random and esoteric that even smart guys like Anderson and Noah Baumbach are left speechless.

{"description": "Roseanneburst onto the screen in 1988, when top-rated sitcomThe Cosby Showexuded a smugFather Knows Bestglossiness. In contrast, the blue-collar Conner family bickered with the offhand nastiness of real families, which didn't mean they loved each other any less. Front and center was Roseanne Barr (now known by the single name Roseanne), a former stand-up comedian who wasn't afraid to rock the boat (her fights with producers were legendary). When even the fat guys on sitcoms have svelte, hottie wives, it's hard to believe that this woman--overweight, abrasive, with a voice like a wood chipper--became top of the television heap.  Roseanne spoke up for a kind of lower-class feminism; she didn't concern herself much with politics, but within the family she just as much in charge as her husband Dan (the ever-dependable John Goodman,Barton Fink,The Big Lebowski)--though in the final episode of the first season, she took a stand at her factory job that was halfNorma Rae, halfCool Hand Luke. But most often the show turned the ordinary rituals of domestic life (putting the kids to bed, coping with visiting parents) into sharp comic scenarios. The stories were smartly hidden in a series of scenes that felt organic and unforced. The entire cast--one of the best ensembles ever, including theater veteran Laurie Metcalf (Scream 2) as Roseanne's sister Jackie; Lecy Goranson as eldest daughter Becky; Michael Fishman as youngest child D.J.; and especially Sara Gilbert (Poison Ivy,ER) as middle daughter Darlene--swiftly cultivated the mixture of comfort and tension that marks most family relationships. The result was a portrait of American family life that rang achingly, hilariously true.Roseanne's first season was solid from the start; few shows have had such an immediate grasp of their ideal tone and rhythm. Roseanne may have been a little stiff in the first few episodes, but she developed her chops quickly. By only the third episode, in which Roseanne and Dan run into a divorced friend at a restaurant and do some impromptu evaluating of their own married life, Roseanne was already exploring the psychology behind the wisecracks. By episode 6, set in a bowling alley, Roseanne begins to truly inhabit her character, growing more physically and emotionally expansive (she herself singles out this episode as the one where she started to have fun). Roseanne was never afraid to share the spotlight; Goodman, Metcalf, and the kids all had central roles in one episode or another, and one of the most striking episodes focused on Roseanne's coworker Crystal (the underrated Natalie West), whose husband had been embedded in concrete while working on a bridge. This black comic premise gave way to surprisingly touching grief when old secrets emerged.  Guest performers like George Clooney (a semi-regular in the first season), Ned Beatty (as Dan's father), Estelle Parsons (an insidious turn as Roseanne's mother), and Fred Thompson (as a domineering supervisor) always had meaty material to work with. Simply one of the best sitcoms of all time. Caveat: the set uses the episodes as they were shortened for syndication, not the originally broadcast versions that were 2-3 minutes longer.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0058JEI06", "B007C8RZJW", "B007C8RZYC", "B008L0YMUK", "B008L0YN6I", "B00B04NJ12", "B00B04NIOU", "B00BUWD7SO", "B005BIGAL4", "B005ENCIXU", "B008XJM8ZU", "B00BUWD7E8", "B0002W4SX6", "B00GOC75YW", "B00DJYK1XU", "B0007KTBJO", "B0058JEHTS", "B000AJJNJK", "B00D2UMHSI", "B0058JEHSO", "B000EYK4H6", "B000I2J6VE", "B0000AKY3Q", "B000AJJNIQ", "B000EBGFQI", "B00GLT2SOA", "B00000F5W8", "B0007ZSHR6", "B0002W4SWW", "B0009YCLBS", "B000H7JCG4", "B000C1VBAA", "B00BXPMJL4", "B0058EE6OO", "B00I099K4U", "B0058EE6NK", "B00008WJEZ", "B000291Q3O", "B000KGGIL4", "B00D2UMHB0", "B000291Q3Y", "B000067DNE", "B0000C9JFQ", "B0000DFZ5O", "B000I2J6W8", "B004D2GMVM", "B0006J27WY", "B0009B16TO", "B0007US79Y", "B0007R4SWC", "B00I458456", "B002E58FT2", "B000MGBSHQ", "B002E58FTW", "B000SQFC0O", "B0007YXRCW", "B0000CGNEC", "B00079FUI6", "B004MWLXTY", "B00008NV4G", "B007KFZ7UQ", "B00BDZV8ZM", "B009LDD3I8", "B000K7UBXE", "B00005JLIB", "B000KP62FM", "B001G0MFOM", "B007KFZ85K", "B0036TGSR6", "B007C8RZQ0", "B000FBH3WM", "B00005JOHC", "B008L3650M", "B008KZX7W0", "B0000E32X2", "B0002NY81M", "B000E3L7FK", "B00005JKJS", "B007KFZ8B4", "B000M341S2", "B000FBH3WC", "B0002UE1WQ", "B00005JLEX", "B0012018OE", "B000HEZEYG", "B0007V6IWQ", "B00005JM3G", "B008L3653O", "B006WK4Y8Q", "B00007KK5I", "B0001ZMWXW", "B001DHXT5C", "B000FA57U8", "B005D0OHA6", "B007RMQ4HW", "B000H1RFXM", "B003TNW02G", "B0006Z2L4W", "B00HVTRDZ8"], "bought_together": ["B0058JEI06", "B007C8RZJW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00BUWD7E8", "B007C8RZJW", "B008L0YMUK", "B007C8RZYC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 153432}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 18.3, "brand": "", "asin": "B00005JNF7", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/511DAJ50NPL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Roseanne: Season 1"}
{"description": "The delightful designs of William Joyce (writer/illustrator of such popular children's books asGeorge ShrinksandBently & Egg) makeRobotsa joy to behold. The round, bouncy, and ramshackle forms of hero Rodney Copperbottom and his computer-animated friends are part of an ornate and daffyFender providing assistance.Rube-Goldberg universe of elaborate contraptions and gleaming metallic surfaces.  Rodney (voiced with a hint-of-Scottish lilt by Ewan McGregor) is a young inventor who sets off for Robot City to work for Big Weld (Mel Brooks), the supreme inventor of the mechanical world.  But upon his arrival, Rodney discovers that Big Weld has disappeared, and the slick, shiny Ratchet (Greg Kinnear,As Good As It Gets) is phasing out the spare parts that lumpen robots need to function and replacing them with \"upgrades\"--expensive and glistening new exoskeletons. Unfortunately, from this suitable beginning, the story degenerates into a series of action sequences that make very little sense, though some are kinetic and fun (though others are only there to serve the inevitableRobotsvideo game). Most kids will enjoy the sheer visual pleasure of the movie, but compared to the narrative richness of Pixar movies likeThe IncrediblesandToy Story, that pleasure is pretty short-lived. Also featuring the voices of Robin Williams, Halle Berry, Jim Broadbent, Amanda Bynes, Jennifer Coolidge, and many, many more.--Bret FetzerDVD FeaturesJennifer Coolidge returns as the voice of Aunt Fanny in a mildly amusing new short, \"Aunt Fanny's Tour of Booty,\" which allows her to again be the butt of the joke.  Fans of the characters will enjoy both a 17-minute discussion of the robots' creation as well as profiles of 11 of the bots, including early, almost unrecognizable conceptual sketches and brief interviews with the voice cast.  The original short is fairly dull, and of the three deleted scenes, the most finished is an extended version of Rodney's initial meeting with Tim at the gate.  One other is in sketch form only but does preserve another performance by Robin Williams.  The kids' games are pretty good.  There's a dancing robot that will perform eight routines on command or in random order.  A memory game has a bit of replay value, and the build-a-bot segment takes some thought and investigation.  The Xbox demo is a nifty little diversion that transforms one element (the transport-pod race) of the full-length, single-player Xbox game into a frenetic one- to four-player free-for-all.In their commentary track, director Chris Wedge and producer-inspiration William Joyce have to remind each other to stop patting themselves on the back, but it is interesting to hear them talk about old games such as Mousetrap that played a part in developing the film.  (Wedge's frequent references to a possible \"director's cut\" might not seem like a joke to DVD buyers who have gotten tired of DVD rereleases.)  The commentary track by the Blue Sky technical team might be better, offering insights into the characters and the creation of the film without lapsing into too much techie-speak.--David HoriuchiStills fromRobots(click for larger image)The World ofRobotsThe Art of RobotsRobotssoundtrackRobotsscoreRobotsfor XboxRobotsfor PS2Robotsfor GBA", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0006JMLRK", "B000M343BC", "B002WJI2QQ", "B001DPHDCY", "B0012EM5D8", "B004HO6I4M", "B00003CXJ4", "B00CWM58WY", "B000MV9026", "B0006UEVT0", "B001GCUO7A", "0783231474", "B005SDUV4E", "B000RMJ4F8", "B0000640SC", "B000ROAK2W", "B0013FSL3E", "B001LPWGFA", "B004EPZ034", "B001U3D88M", "B000ION23A", "B005LAIISA", "B0000AOX0O", "B000UFIYOO", "B001PR0YEE", "6305161887", "B00029LO0Y", "B008NNY9QW", "B000G75AZC", "B000H7JCK0", "B006JD48LO", "B000L22SG6", "B00B7EQPNE", "B001ECQ75A", "B004AKCME8", "B000AY74OG", "B000VBJEEG", "B00F522C7C", "B000DWMYQ8", "B002ZG97YM", "B008JFUQ16", "B004LWZW7Y", "B000BITUVG", "B0000VV4W2", "B005LAIH4A", "B00003CXG7", "B00005JMQZ", "B00007LVCM", "B0042U94UQ", "B00CHVJODE", "B001PR0Y7Q", "B00E9ZATJO", "B00009M9BK", "0449810798", "B0090SI1RM", "B00BG0RSJ4", "B001KVZ6FW", "1620575175", "B009AMAH3O", "B00I6JOD2S", "B000CZ0PT4", "B0013FSWT2", "B0034G4OYA", "B00AFEX83C", "B000UVKGPI", "B000065V42", "B0039N74CW", "B00JK531ES", "B00HLTD2OE", "B002ZG9904", "B00009YXAW", "6305123454", "B005FLSZQU", "B00005JM7T", "B001GCUNWQ", "B003UESJF6", "B00E00OGE2", "B001HN6918", "B000GUJZ00", "B00I0VTOMG", "B00005JNS0", "B00365F6I2", "B000EQ5UHS", "B000LPS2VI", "B00005JN4W", "B000B8QFYG", "B001NCDFTW", "B0030ZIZRC", "B00CTNYLQA", "B00G5G7EXY", "B007FF3HQM", "B00947N6D8", "B00EBBGLFC", "B005QODEEE", "B00ALMNCLQ", "B00362RUX4", "B00005JN0T", "B000GIXEWC", "B00005TN8K", "B005LAIIT4"], "bought_together": ["B00CWM58WY", "B004HO6I4M"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00CWM58WY", "B004HO6I4M", "B002WJI2QQ", "B001DPHDCY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 3335}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.95, "brand": "Fox Home Entertainment", "asin": "B00005JNQS", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61RM90ARRPL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Robots (Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "Movies don't come any bigger than Peter Jackson'sKing Kong, a three-hour remake of the 1933 classic that marries breathtaking visual prowess with a surprising emotional depth. Expanding on the original story of the blonde beauty and the beast who falls for her, Jackson creates a movie spectacle that matches hisLord of the Ringsfilms and even at times evokes their fantasy world while celebrating the glory of '30s Hollywood. Naomi Watts stars as Ann Darrow, a vaudeville actress down on her luck in Depression-era New York until manic filmmaker Carl Denham (a game but miscast Jack Black) entices her with a lead role. Dazzled by the genius of screenwriter Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody), Ann boards the tramp steamer S.S.Venture, which she--and most of the wary crew--believes is headed for Singapore. Denham, however, is in search of the mythic Skull Island, hoping to capture its wonders on film and make a fortune. What he didn't count on were some scary natives who find that the comely Darrow looks like prime sacrifice material for a mysterious giant creature....There's no point in rehashing the entire plot, as every movie aficionado is more than familiar with the trajectory ofKing Kong; the challenge facing Jackson, his screenwriters, and the phenomenal visual-effects team was to breathe new life into an old, familiar story. To that degree, they achieve what could be best called a qualified success. Though they've assembled a crackerjack supporting cast, including Thomas Kretschmann as theVenture's hard-bitten captain and young Jamie Bell as a plucky crewman, the first third of the movie is rather labored, with too much minute detail given over to sumptuous re-creations of '30s New York and the unexciting initial leg of theVenture's sea voyage. However, once the film finds its way to Skull Island (which bears more than a passing resemblance toLOTR's Mordor),Kongturns into a dazzling movie triumph, by turns terrifying and awe-inspiring. The choreography and execution of the action set pieces--including one involving Kong and a trio of Tyrannosaurus Rexes, as well as another that could be charitably described as a bug-phobic's nightmare--is nothing short of landmark filmmaking, and a certain Mr. Spielberg should watch his back, asKongtrumps most anything that has come before it.Despite the visual challenges ofKing Kong, the movie's most difficult hurdle is the budding romance between Ann and her simian soulmate. Happily, this is where Jackson unqualifiedly triumphs, as this unorthodox love story is tenderly and humorously drawn, by turns sympathetic and wondrous. Watts, whose accessibility balances out her almost otherworldly loveliness, works wonders with mere glances, and Andy Serkis, who digitally embodies Kong here much as he did Gollum in theLOTRfilms, breathes vibrant life into the giant star of the film without ever overplaying any emotions. The final, tragic act of the film, set mostly atop the Empire State Building, is whereKongearns its place in movie history as a work that celebrates both the technical and emotional heights that film can reach.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"bought_together": ["B000EHQTZO", "B00AEFYEU8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000EHQTZO", "B00AEFYEU8", "B0087ZG7HK", "0767817478"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 32487}, "categories": [["Movies & TV"]], "price": 8.94, "brand": "Universal Studios", "asin": "B00005JO20", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/513Y54TGdwL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "King Kong (Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "Along withDesperate Housewives,Lostwas one of the two breakout shows in the fall of 2004. Mixing suspense and action with a sci-fi twist, it began with a thrilling pilot episode in which a jetliner traveling from Australia to Los Angeles crashes, leaving 48 survivors on an unidentified island with no sign of civilization or hope of imminent rescue. That may sound likeGilligan's IslandmeetsSurvivor, butLostkept viewers tuning in every Wednesday night--and spending the rest of the week speculating on Web sites--with some irresistible hooks (not to mention the beautiful women). First, there's a huge ensemble cast of no fewer than 14 regular characters, and each episode fills in some of the back story on one of them. There's a doctor; an Iraqi soldier; a has-been rock star; a fugitive from justice; a self-absorbed young woman and her brother; a lottery winner; a father and son; a Korean couple; a pregnant woman; and others. Second, there's a host of unanswered questions: What is the mysterious beast that lurks in the jungle? Why do polar bears and wild boars live there? Why has a woman been transmitting an SOS message in French from somewhere on the island for the last 16 years? Why do impossible wishes seem to come true? Are they really on a physical island, or somewhere else? What is the significance of the recurring set of numbers? And will Kate ever give up her bad-boy fixation and hook up with Jack?Lostdid have some hiccups during the first season. Some plot threads were left dangling for weeks, and the \"oh, it didn't really happen\" card was played too often. But the strong writing and topnotch cast kept the show a cut above most network TV. The best-known actor at the time of the show's debut was Dominic Monaghan, fresh off his stint as Merry the Hobbit in Peter Jackson'sLord of the Ringsfilms. The rest of the cast is either unknowns or \"where I have I seen that face before\" supporting players, including Matthew Fox and Evangeline Lilly, who are the closest thing to leads. Other standouts include Naveen Andrews, Terry O'Quinn (who's made a nice career out of conspiracy-themed TV shows), Josh Holloway, Jorge Garcia, Yunjin Kim, Maggie Grace, and Emilie de Ravin, but there's really not a weak link in the cast. Co-created by J.J. Abrams (Alias),Lostleft enough unanswered questions after its first season to keep viewers riveted for a second season.--David HoriuchiWhere Have I Seen These Castaways?

The episodes are presented in widescreen format, just as they were broadcast on high-definition channels. (Conventional ABC-TV broadcasts were reduced to 1.33 full-screen format.) Four of the episodes have commentary tracks by the producing team and the actors who were featured on certain episodes (Terry O'Quinn, Dominic Monaghan, and Maggie Grace and Ian Sommerhalder). The last disc has over three hours of bonus material sensibly broken into three categories. \"Departure\" discusses the initial creation of the series, the making of the pilot, and the cast (some characters were created to fit the actors, and Evangeline Lilly's Kate was the hardest to cast). It also includes the cast's audition tapes and photographs by Matthew Fox. \"Tales from the Island\" provides background material on seven of the episodes plus the boars used in filming, Jimmy Kimmel's appearance on the set, and the genesis of the Driveshaft song (\"You all everybody...\"). Finally, \"Lost Revealed\" includes two scenes cut from the season finale, 13 other deleted scenes (not identified by episode, unfortunately), a blooper reel, and the cast and crew's giddy appearance at the Museum of Television & Radio.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000FIMG68", "B000P6YNSE", "B0018CWEYY", "B0019LY5IM", "B0036EH3XE", "B000ESSSK2", "B00G4SD75W", "B000QDLSR0", "B0018CWEZ8", "B001AQMBKA", "B000FKO3GW", "B0036EH3X4", "B000TFINY6", "B001B7CNZ6", "B002N5N5MK", "B002JVWRD6", "B0024FAD9C", "0756665949", "B00129W6LE", "B000BNI90Y", "1550227432", "1550228781", "1550227998", "B000YABIQ6", "1550229516", "1550228919", "B000AJJNFE", "B0009VBTP0", "B001AQMBJQ", "B0009A407A", "B000F3UAE8", "B000RO6JY0", "B0026RHR6U", "0615508294", "B001DJLCRC", "B0001O3YLM", "B001QE99AQ", "B003R0MEYA", "B003L77GJM", "B000FIMG5Y", "B00062IDEW", "1463548702", "B0038M2APA", "B0024FAR66", "B004TJ1GY2", "B002AMVED8", "B001MVWRNO", "B000I0QLR8", "B0000Y40PW", "B0024F08RO", "B000NDEXK2", "B001C4CI8U", "B00008YGRU", "B000FFJYC0", "B000N3T0EG", "B000EWBNMI", "B004LROMSO", "B00FFSTPDU", "B001HUWQEA", "B000GETTKM", "B00IWTVDUW", "B0024FAD9W", "B003L77GTC", "B002U0KHME", "B000FVQLIO", "B000W6ZUUC", "B0049P1VHS", "B009LDD4V4", "B0075FF5QM", "B0038M2AOG", "B000FOPPBA", "B001934SNM", "B0055SNHQG", "B00D2ZF24O", "B00079FUI6", "B0053O8A46", "B004YM6JK0", "B00B5ARKC0", "B00DII0MGI", "B00005JO9J", "B002BFBB0A", "B000AJJNI6", "B000Q6GUW0", "B002GOAH1A", "B00BHLTIXQ", "B008H6GHF6", "B003L77G2Y", "B00000FBH2", "B000FIMG4U", "B005S97V82", "B00CWIMVDW", "B000Q6GUKW", "B000P6YNSO", "B001GCUER0", "B001G0MFIS", "B0001HAGQK", "B001VPJYZK", "B001VPJYZ0", "0425188809", "B000BOH986"], "bought_together": ["B000FIMG68", "B000P6YNSE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000FIMG68", "B0036EH3XE", "B0018CWEYY", "B000P6YNSE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 5709}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 16.5, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B00005JNOG", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51nb5sJm%2B3L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Lost - The Complete First Season"}

{"description": "This two-disc collector's edition ofPirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chestis packed with over five hours of special features that delve into everything from creating the mythology-inspired Davy Jones and Kraken figures, to working and planning without a completed script, the incredible CGI techniques used in the film, the intense sword training sessions and stunt work, and the unpredictability of filming on location in the Caribbean. The audio commentary by writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio is an interesting and insightful look into the finished film, but perhaps even more revealing is the 25-minute \"Charting the Return\" preproduction diary in which everyone from producer Jerry Bruckheimer to associate director Peter Kohn and writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio give a sense of the enormity of the project of concurrently writing and filming two sequels toPirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl. The overwhelming logistics of planning and casting without a finished script, scouting and preparing remote locations, constructing a new Black Pearl, and functional props like the rolling water wheel, and cutting costs to stay within budget are nothing less than mind-boggling. In the hourlong \"According to Plan\" feature, director Gore Verbinski, producer Jerry Bruckheimer, and a host of others detail the enormity of the project, focusing on the stamina involved in a 200-day shooting schedule and the need for adaptability and flexibility in dealing with everything from behind schedule excavations to the logistics of shooting on moving water and even the natural fury of a full-blown hurricane.  Shorter featurettes \"Meet Davy Jones: Anatomy of a Legend\" and \"Creating the Kraken\" focus on the mythological creatures in the film and the awesome visual effects and advances in CGI technology that made them possible.  \"Mastering the Blade\" follows Orlando Bloom (Will Turner), Keira Knightley (Elizabeth Swann), and Jack Davenport (Norrington) through some intense sword-fighting training sessions and \"Fly on the Set: The Bone Cage\" offers a frightening look at what it was like to shoot the bone cage scene of the movie.

{"description": "Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's Endis a rollicking voyage in the same spirit of the two earlierPiratesfilms, yet far darker in spots (and nearly three hours to boot). The action, largely revolving around a pirate alliance against the ruthless East India Trading Company, doesn't disappoint, though the violence is probably too harsh for young children. Through it all, the plucky cast (Keira Knightley, Orlando Bloom, Geoffrey Rush) are buffeted by battle, maelstroms, betrayal, treachery, a ferocious Caribbean weather goddess, and that gnarly voyage back from the world's end--but with their wit intact. As always, Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow tosses off great lines ; he chastises \"a woman scorned, like which hell hath no fury than!\" He insults an opponent with a string of epithets, ending in \"yeasty codpiece.\"!In the previousThe Curse of the Black Pearl, Sparrow was killed--sent to Davy Jones' Locker. In the opening scenes, the viewer sees that death has  not been kind to Sparrow--but that's not to say he hasn't found endless ways to amuse himself, cavorting with dozens of hallucinated versions of himself on the deck of the Black Pearl. But Sparrow is needed in this world, so a daring rescue brings him back. Keith Richards' much ballyhooed appearance as Jack's dad is little more than a cameo, though he does play a wistful guitar. But the action, as always, is more than satisfying, held together by Depp, who, outsmarting the far-better-armed British yet again, causes a bewigged commander to muse: \"Do you think he plans it all out, or just makes it up as he goes along?\" As far as fans are concerned, it matters not.--A.T. HurleyOn the DVDHere's something you can't say about just any DVD extras: There appears to bemoreof Keith Richards in the outtakes, interviews, and other special features on theAt World's Enddisc than in the actual film. For those scenes alone, this special edition is well worth the price. Richards looks as woozy and gamey as all the rumors suggested, and answers questions he's not asked, with Johnny Depp sitting next to him, almost acting as a translator. Richards offers pithy comments like, \"Everything I do is original, you better believe,\" and smiles when other cast members call him \"Two-Take Richards\" for supposedly nailing his scenes.The packed second disc also includes a terrific mini-doc on how the filmmakers created the famous maelstrom, in an enormous hanger in Palmdale, California, with the ships floating 30 feet off the ground. \"Just moving theBlack Pearlwas an enormous undertaking,\" says producer Jerry Bruckheimer with serious understatement. Other cool extras include \"Tale of the Many Jacks,\" deleted scenes with great commentary, \"The World of Chow Yun-Fat,\" a bio of composer Hans Zimmer, features on the set designers, a look at the impressive Brethren Court, and some hilarious bloopers. \"You can't curse in a Disney film,\" deadpans Depp when a costar blurts out something blue. \"See? I told him.\" The extras are truly as much of a rollicking adventure as the film.--A.T.

{"description": "You know you're going to get a different kind of superhero when you cast Robert Downey Jr. in the lead role. AndIron Manis different, in welcome ways. Cleverly updated from Marvel Comics' longstanding series,Iron Manputs billionaire industrialist Tony Stark (that's Downey) in the path of some Middle Eastern terrorists; in a brilliantly paced section, Stark invents an indestructible suit that allows him to escape. If the rest of the movie never quite hits that precise rhythm again, it nevertheless offers plenty of pleasure, as the renewed Stark swears off his past as a weapons manufacturer, develops his new Iron Man suit, and puzzles both his business partner (Jeff Bridges in great form) and executive assistant (Gwyneth Paltrow). Director Jon Favreau geeks out in fun ways with the hardware, but never lets it overpower the movie, and there's always a goofy one-liner or a slapstick pratfall around to break the tension. As for Downey, he doesn't get to jitterbug around too much in his improv way, but he brings enough of his unpredictable personality to keep the thing fresh. And listen up, hardcore Marvel mavens: even if you know the Stan Lee cameo is coming, you won't be able to guess it until it's on the screen. It all builds to a splendid final scene, with a concluding line delivery by Downey that just feels absolutely right.--Robert HortonStills fromIron Man(Click for larger image)&nbsp;", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00E5I2M6I", "B008JFUO72", "B001DHXT20", "B00E5I2M9K", "B00E5I2MEK", "B0083SBMBM", "B008JFUS0U", "B001CDR1FG", "B00E5I2MAO", "B004LWZWFQ", "B001GCUO1Q", "B008JFUPFI", "B000VI70QS", "B000HEVZ9E", "B0000959N0", "B00005JKCH", "B00005JNJV", "B00005JNTU", "B0090SI56Y", "B000VR0570", "B00005JMQW", "B002HWRYJE", "B0007P0Y7C", "B004LWZW42", "B00D7OMNXS", "B001OQCV6A", "B007K3JFUQ", "B004EPZ07K", "B004LWZWGA", "B000UR9T8C", "B0083SBJXS", "B0060FXDCG", "B002IPFWTE", "B00E5I2ME0", "B00IXD2MGQ", "B000AYELVA", "B00C6B8TB8", "B008QZ5PY2", "B000OVLBF8", "B000AYELVU", "B00AZMFJYA", "B001QB9H1U", "B009JBWOU0", "B001AK3S4Y", "B001GZ6QC4", "B005G4TJUC", "B002NXSRVG", "B000HCO83Q", "B003YOZNBU", "B003Q6D2B4", "B00023B1LC", "B0002IQMAM", "B008JFURII", "B00HERGM86", "B00E5I2MDQ", "B006VRRGNK", "B002ZG99QS", "B00000JQB5", "B007REV4T8", "B00008G8M5", "B008Y1YK9Y", "B0002ZDVEU", "6305718954", "B001DTPZNY", "B005LAIGW8", "B001F7MSFM", "B001GCUNWQ", "B00A2H9P98", "B000RW3VDE", "B002O5M4T4", "B00005JA8B", "B005LAIIPS", "B005LAII44", "B00BEIYHO2", "B000GUJZ00", "B00005N5S5", "B002SJIO4A", "B000VWYJ86", "B004EPZ0BG", "B0049IHX2C", "B00AEBBAEK", "B00005JM5E", "B008JFUOWM", "B000FS9FCG", "B00005PJ6N", "B00979KQFO", "B00AEFXKUI", "B002K0WBXW", "B0042U94UQ", "B004EPYZUS", "B008JFUQZ2", "B0084IG8TM", "B001DJLD1M", "B008JFUS5A", "B00006HBUJ", "B000J103OI", "B00F84H73Q", "B0087ZG7NO", "B000U1ZV8K"], "bought_together": ["B00E5I2M6I", "B008JFUO72"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B008JFUO72", "B00E5I2M6I", "B001DHXT20", "B00E5I2MEK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 12121}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.99, "brand": "DOWNEY,ROBERT JR.", "asin": "B00005JPS8", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515wjJQt2nL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Iron Man (Ultimate 2 Disc Edition)"}
{"description": "Alas! The fifthHarry Potterfilm has arrived. The time is long past that this can be considered a simple \"children's\" series--though children and adults alike will enjoy it immensely. Starting off from the dark and tragic ending of the fourth film,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenixbegins in a somber and angst-filled tone that carries through the entire 138 minutes (the shortest of anyHPmovie despite being adapted from the longest book). Hopes of winning the Quidditch Cup have been replaced by woes like government corruption, distorted media spin, and the casualties of war. As the themes have matured, so have the primary characters' acting abilities. Ron (Rupert Grint), Hermione (Emma Watson), and especially Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) are more convincing than ever--in roles that are more demanding.Harry is deeply traumatized from having witnessed Cedric Diggory's murder, but he will soon find that this was just another chapter in the continuing loss he will endure. Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) has returned and, in an attempt to conceal this catastrophe from the wizarding public, the Ministry of Magic has teamed up with the wizard newspaperThe Daily Prophetto smear young Potter and wise Dumbledore (Michael Gambon)--seemingly the only two people in the public eye who believe the Dark Lord has returned. With no one else to stand against the wicked Death Eaters, the Hogwarts headmaster is forced to revive his secret anti-Voldemort society, the Order of the Phoenix. This welcomes back characters like Mad-Eye Moody (Brendan Gleeson), kind Remus Lupin (David Thewlis), fatherly Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), and insidious Severus Snape (Alan Rickman), and introduces a short list of intriguing new faces. In the meantime, a semi-psychotic bureaucrat from the Ministry (brilliantly portrayed by Imelda Staunton) has seized power at Hogwarts, and Harry is forced to form a secret society of his own--lest the other young wizards at his school be left ill-equipped to defend themselves in the looming war between good and evil. In addition, Harry is filled with an inexplicable rage that only his Godfather Sirius seems to be able to understand.This film, though not as frightening as its predecessor, earns its PG-13 rating mostly because of the ever-darkening tone.  As always, the loyal fans of J.K. Rowling's books will suffer huge cuts from the original plot and character developments, but make no mistake: this is agoodmovie.--Jordan ThompsonOn the DVDThe second disc ofThe Order of the Phoenixfeatures \"The Hidden Secrets of Harry Potter,\" a retrospective on the series so far, with \"Potter experts\" (i.e., people who run fan sites) weighing in on what's to come. This must have been filmed during production, because all their speculation about the conclusion of the saga is clearly dated and therefore superfluous (sinceOrderreleased theatrically at the same time as the seventh book, one would've expected a more current analysis). Many of the deleted scenes are mostly extensions, with the exception of one hilarious take of Professor Trelawney (Emma Thompson) trying--unsuccessfully--to eat gracefully during Dolores Umbridge's introduction at Hogwarts. The chatty actress Natalia Tena, who plays Tonks, gives a tour of the set in \"Trailing Tonks,\" even playing a Christmas song she wrote on her guitar, and director David Yates and editor Mark Day demonstrate editing 101 with a feature that lets you edit your own scene from the movie. Watch the feature but skip the self-editing part; the controls are too complicated to navigate and too frustrating to work properly (plus, hit the wrong button and you've gone all the way back to the beginning).

{"description": "The Dark Knightarrives with tremendous hype (best superhero movie ever? posthumous Oscar for Heath Ledger?), and incredibly, it lives up to all of it.  But calling it the best superhero movie ever seems like faint praise, since part of what makes the movie great--in addition to pitch-perfect casting, outstanding writing, and a compelling vision--is that it bypasses the normal fantasy element of the superhero genre and makes it all terrifyingly real.  Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) is Gotham City's new district attorney, charged with cleaning up the crime rings that have paralyzed the city. He enters an uneasy alliance with the young police lieutenant, Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman), and Batman (Christian Bale), the caped vigilante who seems to trust only Gordon--and whom only Gordon seems to trust. They make progress until a psychotic and deadly new player enters the game: the Joker (Heath Ledger), who offers the crime bosses a solution--kill the Batman. Further complicating matters is that Dent is now dating Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal, after Katie Holmes turned down the chance to reprise her role), the longtime love of Batman's alter ego, Bruce Wayne.In his last completed role before his tragic death, Ledger is fantastic as the Joker, a volcanic, truly frightening force of evil. And he sets the tone of the movie: the world is a dark, dangerous place where there are no easy choices.  Eckhart and Oldman also shine, but as good as Bale is, his character turns out rather bland in comparison (not uncommon for heroes facing more colorful villains). Director-cowriter Christopher Nolan (Memento) follows his critically acclaimedBatman Beginswith an even better sequel that sets itself apart from notable superhero movies likeSpider-Man 2andIron Manbecause of its sheer emotional impact and striking sense of realism--there are no suspension-of-disbelief superpowers here. At 152 minutes, it's a shade too long, and it's much too intense for kids. But for most movie fans--and not just superhero fans--The Dark Knightis a film for the ages.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B00DUCXFUC", "B004LWZWGK", "B000PC6A3E", "B002ZG981E", "B00G4RD4PQ", "B0039208QM", "B001GMALGY", "B00E2Y0YBK", "B00C2IGQBA", "B0039208JE", "B00H14WTLQ", "B0039208CG", "B0085D3I3K", "B0039208C6", "B000M5AJQI", "B00319ECGK", "B001FB55H6", "B00EIG5M5A", "7020070078", "B00E2Y6AUY", "B00D5FMGGS", "B001OQCV6K", "B0013FBS20", "B000Q6GX5Y", "B001GKJ2FC", "B00FPS79F6", "B001992NUQ", "B004JMSIRC", "B001RIY4WE", "B00DYEN6XC", "B008QZ5PY2", "B001F7MSG6", "B00FAHYNWE", "B00J7PRJXU", "B001AQT0Z4", "B001UV4XEW", "B0083SBJXS", "B00AEFY552", "B00C8RD79O", "B007KAJG3K", "B007L4HET8", "B004EPZ07U", "B007L4HFDI", "B00AEFXKOO", "B000PC0U1W", "B00C6B8TB8", "B00HINFI4K", "B003TT2X6I", "B001KZIRM2", "B002ZG99NG", "B00EZ4M68G", "B004SIP90G", "B003ZHR6RK", "B001GCUO16", "B003TT2X6S", "B00JNEWSLS", "B001F3FUK6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00DUCXFUC", "B004LWZWGK", "B002ZG981E", "B000PC6A3E"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "asin": "B00005JPY0", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51pGxSkkz4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Dark Knight [Theatrical Release]"}

{"description": "Along withMonty Python's Flying Circus,The Avengerspractically defined British cult television, and it was never better than during the three years that Diana Rigg's Emma Peel character tossed out her witty barbs and karate kicks.The Complete Emma Peel Megasetencompasses all 51 episodes from 1965-66 (in black and white) and 1967 (in color).  Paired with Patrick Macnee as the dapper, umbrella-wielding John Steed, Rigg's Mrs. Peel turned heads with her sexy outfits, then broke skulls of the various would-be world-dominating bad guys who crossed her path.  Like the mixed crime-fighting teams who came after them in shows likeMoonlightingandThe X-Files, Steed and Mrs. Peel had a constant platonic playfulness.  In one episode when Mrs. Peel is working undercover at a department store, Steed drops in for a visit, remarking, \"They told me 'Mrs. Peel is in Ladies Underwear.'  I rattled up the stairs three at a time.\" However, unlike their spiritual successors, Steed and Mrs. Peel never jumped the shark; instead she bid a fond farewell as she passed the torch to Steed's next partner, Tara King (Linda Thorson), just as she had been passed the torch from Honor Blackman.

{"description": "LikeCarriebefore it,Ginger Snapsuses horror-movie conventions as an inspired metaphor for puberty. When beautiful but reclusive goth teenager Ginger (Katharine Isabelle) is attacked by a monstrous wolf on the eve of her first period, her body starts changing in a big way, as do her suddenly lusty, feral appetites. Director John Fawcett masterfully balances the expectations of teen horror exploitation (blood, bodies, sex, smart dialogue, and good old-fashioned monster-movie scares) with clever black humor and tender sisterly solidarity. Only devoted sister Brigitte (gloomy Emily Perkins) knows the truth, and even as Ginger's abrupt transformation threatens their once unbreakable friendship, bonds of blood and love keep them together: Brigitte disposes of Ginger's victims while searching for a cure. Mimi Rogers costars as their dotty but unexpectedly sensitive mom, ready to sacrifice all to protect her daughter.

Neglected by his father, an unscrupulous contractor who's constantly having sex with his new girlfriend, Howie falls in with a group of boys who break into houses for kicks. After one break-in Howie is caught by Big John (Brian Cox, the original Hannibal Lecter fromManhunter), a former Marine with a taste for young boys. But the relationship that develops between Howie and Big John surprises them both.L.I.E.captures male adolescence more genuinely than any other film in recent memory; the realism of the relationships, particularly between Howie and his father, is completely compelling. The movie affects all the senses; you can practically feel the texture of Howie's blue flannel sheets, smell the greenery that grows along the Long Island Expressway.

{"description": "Retelling a story that has made it onto the silver screen more than most, this latest adaptation of The Count of Monte Cristo makes yet another swashbuckling attempt to win over a new generation of cinema goers. A dashing James Caviezel takes the role of the Count, who is driven by a desire for revenge after being betrayed by his best friend Fernand (played by a dishevelled Guy Pearce) and landed with 16 years of solitary confinement in Chateau D'If, a damp cavernous prison. Thus the scene is set for a good old-fashioned romp. The trouble with this \"re-imagining\" (to borrow a phrase from Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes) is that it's never quite sure whether to take itself seriously or not. Alexandre Dumas's original story is a traditionally melodramatic tale of deceit and double-crossing, with clear-cut bad guys and a moral lesson to be learned at the end. Here, director Kevin Reynolds appears unsure about whether to stick with tradition or bring the story up to date and turn it into a post-modern play on the old Victorian values and style. When the Count and his heavy-breathing loved one are reunited, their kiss is actually framed as a cameo. Both lead actors are also prone to heavy bouts of overacting, garnishing their performances with exaggerated baroque gestures. Clearly this is a film in which the actors could over-indulge themselves and (almost) get away with it, were it not for the fact that--bar Richard Harris as the \"Priest\"--none of them seem to have the faintest idea about how to conduct themselves in a period drama. This Count of Monte Cristo will leave the audience a little confused as to whether they should cry along with the story or laugh along with the actors. --Nikki Disney On the DVD: The Count of Monte Cristo on disc offers no escape from the dry drawl of director Kevin Reynolds, who features in almost every element of the extensive extras package.

{"description": "The first episodes ofI Love Lucy, in comedy terms, look today like a promising map of great things to come from the hugely influential sitcom.  This set of episodes, the first volume in a definitive collection of the classic television series, includes the original three broadcast episodes from October 1951, plus the so-called \"Lost Pilot\" that finds the earliestI Love Lucyproduction quite rough but genuinely promising. The actual episodes that American audiences first saw--\"The Girls Want to Go to a Nightclub,\" \"Be a  Pal,\" and \"The Diet\"--find familiar elements of the classic series already in place. Housewife Lucy (Lucille Ball), restless for excitement, is married to Cuban bandleader Ricky Ricardo (Desi Arnaz). Ricky's crazy nightclub career, however, leaves him yearning for a quiet home life and a wife content with her simple chores. Alas, it's not to be. With best friends Ethel (Vivian Vance) and Fred (William Frawley) usually aboard for the Ricardos' misadventures,I Love Lucyintroduced an engaging blend of sophistication and slapstick, all wrapped in the intimacy of a three-camera TV approach. Bonus material is very satisfying, including a radio broadcast from 1951 later adapted into a TV script, a couple of gaffes, guest cast listings, and a new beginning for the second-season rebroadcast of \"The Diet.\"--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000065U39", "B00006DXXU", "B008VNI9TC", "B008L3653O", "B008KZX7W0", "B00290X6NW", "B008L36520", "B00008972C", "B00GOC75YW", "B008VNIBTK", "B008L3650M", "B00006DXXV", "B00008972D", "B000094J61", "B000094J60", "B0000AI42C"], "bought_together": ["B000065U39", "B00006DXXU"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B008KZX7W0", "B008L36520", "B008L3653O", "B008VNI9TC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 273298}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 14.48, "brand": "Paramount Home Video", "asin": "B000065U38", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51K32PS584L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "I Love Lucy - Season One (Vol. 1)"}

This three-disc set contains all 24 episodes from the superb second season (1973-74) of the series ranked byTV Guideas among the top 25 television shows of all time. The season opener, \"Divided We Stand,\" is a deft reintroduction to these now iconic characters: bleeding-heart surgeon Hawkeye Pearce (Alan Alda in his signature role), kindred misfit spirit Trapper John (Wayne Rogers), clueless administrator Henry Blake (McLean Stevenson), buttoned-up Frank Burns (Larry Linville), and unbuttoned head nurse \"Hot Lips\" (Loretta Swit). In this episode, a visiting psychiatrist evaluates the 4077th to determine whether the unit \"can function as a team.\" His evaluation can serve as this series' mission statement: \"These impossible people are in an impossible place doing totally impossible things. They're mad--quite mad.\"M*A*S*Hexperienced no sophomore slump from its Emmy Award-winning first season. It continued to subvert sitcom convention with multiple-story episodes such as \"Radar's Report.\" Scenes in the operating room play without a laugh track (this DVD gives viewers the option of watching entire episodes minus the intrusive chuckles and guffaws).M*A*S*Halso tackled such issues as racism (\"Dear Dad...

Not thatM*A*S*Hforgot how to be funny. \"Five O'Clock Charlie\" and \"For Want of a Boot\" are strictly for laughs. Hawkeye and Hot Lips memorably exchange flu shots in \"Carry On, Hawkeye.\" Loyal viewers will note the emergence of several supporting characters, including Jamie Farr's Klinger and William Christopher's Father Mulcahy. One also sees the (to some) unfortunate transformation of Gary Burghoff's savvy, crackerjack clerk Radar into a na&#xEF;ve innocent.

{"description": "Not your usual lighthearted romance, Lone Sherfig's heartwarming comedy warms the usually chilly Dogme 95 world of prickly eccentrics and damaged souls with a glowing sense of hope and passion. A belligerent restaurant manager, a repressed hotelier, a lonely hairdresser, and a clumsy, childlike bakery clerk are among the lonely thirtysomethings who escape the social disasters and comic chaos of their unfulfilled lives in an Italian-language evening course. It becomes a place to dream and to heal emotional wounds (and they have more than their fair share of scars). Sherfig manages to turn the familiar social landscape of films asThe CelebrationandThe King Is Alive--fractured families, abusive parents, tragic pasts--into a backdrop for romantic comedy. If not exactly profound,Italian for Beginnersremains a sweet, hopeful, and affirming tale of eccentrics who find friendship, family, and romance while learning the language of love.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00023P4N8", "B0018O50VG", "B00003CXXY", "B003U4H0CE", "B0000CE684", "B00005Y6XU", "B003VA3JTK", "B0006JMLVQ", "B00DJYJQSQ", "B004G8QO7U", "B0000C23T0", "B00598OA2C", "B000I0RNV6", "B000CR8QV6", "0788815490", "B00000F7E6", "B00ARX2VZW", "B004P0IRHE", "B002JTMNZ0", "630560097X", "B00HRJVHEK", "B001CIOCLC", "B0057GYODG", "B00606P0BM", "B008A1AKK6", "B004A8ZWSS", "B0002XNSYU", "B0009P7EI2", "6305094934", "B000085OY1", "B005CFBZX4", "B000059HA5", "B004D45NZG", "B004SIP7D0", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B0016C1QIQ", "B000OCY7JE", "B003L20INS", "B00BTYJYP8", "B006MHZ32K", "0071439579", "B00F6SHGF8", "B00124SNIY", "B00149IN0A", "B004KDYR2A", "B00AEBB8SS", "B000ADWDF2", "B00A1O0G3G", "B00782O7LG", "6305081034", "B00124SNIO", "B000F3UAFC", "B00004TWZJ", "B002W1HBM0", "B00AMEZDK6", "B0002DB52M", "B00E0QSGNS", "B001LPWGCS", "B0001DCYUU", "B000XXWE3A", "B004SIP8W0", "B00JPUUSSU", "B005GP7F5W", "B0000DZ3BJ", "B00008ZZ9K", "6305692696", "0486261808", "1598697692", "B005GRF2ZU", "B000056KMW", "B000E5LEV0", "B005CFC0HE", "B000E3L7L4", "B00009ME9Z", "B004CWLRGI", "0140265406", "B004XVMCLW", "B0015LPRSI", "B000059H9D", "B0001GH5T2", "0071476946", "B000N3T0DW", "B002RZARX6", "B001OTZNYY", "B000B9EYFW", "B00E0QSGKG", "B0002V7S34", "B009ERK1AE", "B004R4PWYY", "B002LE8MGW", "0985338741", "B001THZAAI", "B000093NR0", "B000811672", "B00AZMFO6I", "B00121QGPY", "0486280918", "B001AZJKKK", "B00DL48BM6", "B0002KQOH6"], "bought_together": ["B00023P4N8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004SIP6E0", "B00598OA2C", "0307478572", "B004D45NZG"]}, "price": 19.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 61638}, "asin": "B00006ADFP", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51SQV01S4XL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Italian for Beginners"}

{"description": "In the words of They Might Be Giants' rollicking Grammy-winning theme song, \"life is unfair.\" The inventive and wholly original sitcomMalcolm in the Middlehas been honored with a Peabody Award and Emmys for directing and writing, but if life was fair, it would have earned an Emmy for Best Comedy Series, not to mention statuettes for its pitch-perfect cast. With his perpetual \"yes, me worry\" expression, Frankie Muniz instantly earns audience empathy as Malcolm, whose chances for a normal life are thwarted not only by his genius IQ (as discovered in the pilot episode), but also by his outrageously dysfunctional family: Lois (Jane Kaczmarek), his obsessive, control-freak mother; Hal (Bryan Cranston), his loving but ineffectual father; Francis (Christopher Masterson), his eldest brother waging his own private war at military school; middle brother Reese (Justin Berfield), a delinquent savant; and Dewey (Erik Per Sullivan), the put-upon youngest. As Malcolm observes at one point, \"This family may be rude, loud and gross, and have no shame whatsoever, but with them you know where you stand.\"This three-disc set contains all 16 episodes from the irreverently funny first season. The series instantly toned things down a tad from the pilot episode that saw Lois body-shaving a naked hirsute Hal in the kitchen. But it brilliantly sustains its subversive tone, from episode two, in which the brothers stand united against Lois's increasingly desperate methods to uncover who burned her red dress, to the season finale, in which Malcolm dares to push her down a water slide. Not that there aren't sublimely sweet moments, as in that season finale when Dewey bonds with his elderly babysitter (Bea Arthur!) over Abba's \"Fernando.\" Before you get out your handkerchiefs, said sitter collapses and is carted away in an ambulance.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B003L77FZM", "B002JVWQUU", "B00014K5UK", "B00GJ8CN6G", "B0053O89QU", "B000HDR87S", "B000G6BL88", "B00GT7GYVW", "B003UD7JDA", "B00004YLNO", "B000SO7PCO", "B000M341S2", "B000RO6JZY", "B0019CLMW8", "B0001Z3I0S", "B00EJ4PLFW", "B00008NV4G", "B0019F02WG", "B001L1S1R6", "B002JVWQSW", "B00EEDNR9A", "B008412UKA", "B00005JM3G", "B009Z3QPL6", "B00EJ4PIF0", "B00005JNEQ", "B001NFNFM6", "B00E8GPPG6", "B00IYMSMTM", "B0038Q9Q94", "B001DJLCRC", "B000E1MXWI", "B0058EE6NK", "B00GOC74QG", "B000I0QLRI", "1595320849", "B00EJ4PJ2W", "B002APNJCO", "B00A429YOW", "B0000004RQ", "B000I0QLRS", "B0006N2EZU", "B007KFZ85K", "B000GETTKM", "B001EO5JSE", "B000KLQUMG", "B003L77G06", "B000GPIPTM", "B0058YPG1G", "B000U1ZV2G", "B0001EQHXO", "B000291Q3Y", "B001TKJDNA", "B007Q2FIBQ", "B0002Y4T7O", "B0019F02W6", "B0060MYKYY", "B000NOKFH6", "B002N5N5SO", "B000SINT4S", "B007KFZ7UQ", "B00BUWD7Y8", "B000I0QLQY", "B00006SFKM", "B001RTSPVY", "B007KFZ87S", "B007RMQ4IQ", "B0009VBTP0", "B00GLT2SOA", "B000K7UBXE", "B008L0YN18", "B0032UYFA6", "B00AHQO3L4", "B000HT3P7E", "B000FBH3WC", "B007C8RZR4", "B008L0YMZA", "B00D7AM64I", "B000P0I4P8", "B000F8O2QK", "B004D9FLJE", "B000CCBCCQ", "B007C8RZXS", "B00361XWFK", "B000A7Q1YC", "B001MVYUSO", "B00IO9J5XW", "B00361XWFA", "B000B5XOTS", "B000BOH8Z0", "B001D2WUDE", "B00BM2JVAA", "B00IFK7ONI", "B000F48D14", "B004D2GMVM", "B00FE5MZWM", "B0000E32X2", "B00B2VMNM4", "B0002W4SWW", "B000BUE5D2"], "bought_together": ["B003L77FZM", "B002JVWQUU"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003L77FZM", "B002JVWQUU", "B0053O89QU", "B00GT7GYVW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 63529}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 18.84, "brand": "TWENTIETH CENTURY FOX HOME ENT", "asin": "B00006G8J7", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51BBVW8M32L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Malcolm in the Middle: Season 1"}

{"description": "The third season of Joss Whedon'sBuffy the Vampire Slayerwas marked by the arrival in Sunnydale of renegade slayer Faith (Eliza Dushku), a moody loner who seemed to like her demon-staking calling just a littletoomuch. While Buffy (Sarah Michelle Gellar) was always wary of Faith, the two developed a deep friendship and appreciative rapport--that is, until the evil mayor of Sunnydale (Harry Groener) tapped into Faith's dark side and lured her into his plot to take over the world, first as a double agent spying on Buffy, then as out-and-out nemesis. And as the mayor's ascension approached--which happened to fall on Sunnydale High's graduation day--Buffy and Faith's battles got nastier and nastier, as Buffy attempted to wrestle with her dark side (literally and figuratively), save the world and her friends, and keep her lover Angel (David Boreanaz) out of Faith's evil clutches.Chock-full of exceptional episodes, this third season started out with a bang (the superb season opener \"Anne,\" in which a runaway Buffy finally returns to her Slayer calling) and never let up. Among other highlights, the season introduced former vengeance demon and soon-to-be regular Anya (Emma Caulfield), fleshed out Angel's tortured character (and readied him for his own series), and featured a hilarious doppelganger Willow (Alyson Hannigan), a vampire from a parallel universe, who in Willow's own words was \"evil and... skanky... and kinda gay!\" (Total foreshadowing there, folks.) The season's pi&#xE8;ce de r&#xE9;sistance, though, was the two-parter \"Graduation Day,\" wherein Faith tries to kill Angel, and the students of Sunnydale High prepare to do battle with a mutated mayor and his army of demons. Aside from the series' exceptional writing and acting, this compelling year ofBuffywas anchored by the consistently excellent Gellar, as well as Dushku's complicated Faith, a girl youtrulylove to hate. By the time you finish these episodes, Faith will have cast a spell on you that you'll find very hard to shake.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000EHSVLY", "B000EHSVL4", "B000EHSVM8", "B000EHSVKK", "B000EHSVMS", "B000EHSVN2", "B000I0QLQY", "B000I0QLR8", "B000I0QLRI", "B000I0QLRS", "B000I0QLS2", "B007H9CNOI", "B0006IUE16", "B000HD1482", "B0009W5J4Q", "B000B5XOW0", "B000CCBCGM", "B000ERVJM2", "B000GG4Y6O", "B000JLTRIG", "B000OIOPHC", "B003YF9Q08", "B00344EAQO", "B0000AQS0F", "1593078226", "B00466H3CW", "B005CM1IIE", "B00005JLKB", "1595821651", "B002JVWR4U", "B00JF5G8WU", "B006LG74Q0", "B0024FAR66", "B0001JXPPC", "B00J2T1856", "B00022FWEU", "B00006J3WH", "B0009JE6FC", "B00IKM5LXG", "B00001R3O1", "B000069I1I", "B000CNE0SS", "B000BNI90Y", "B001JAHRME", "1595826106", "B00AMDA2QC", "1442412097", "1595825584", "B00005Y1NF", "159307963X", "B0012Z36F8", "B000X5SPBI", "B003L77GAQ", "B000CNE0TC", "B00133QNS6", "B000EBGFPY", "B001FB4W0C", "B002U8XW9Q", "B001QE99AQ", "B000N6SE4U", "B003R4ZMN6", "0789326302", "B000BOH986", "B009LDCXNY", "B001M5UDGS", "1442412119", "B0018RKEQY", "B000NOKFH6", "B00511N79O", "B002BWP2IK", "B000MX7V66", "B000062XFG", "B00006FD9N", "B00JF5GAZA", "B00133QNSG", "B009LDCWWG", "B00133QNRW", "B000E5KQM8", "B000F3UAE8", "B000FL7CAK", "B000B8QFYG", "B003L77GWE", "B00EIL7E9C", "B00B1RB7TO", "B00191AEYQ", "B0030Y12AA", "B0011FLGZQ", "B000AJJNI6", "B001ILFUA0", "B001MVWRNE", "B000095ZGW", "B000RW3YYA", "B00K0D9760", "B00HEQOAIQ", "B000NA28I4", "B000LC4ZI0", "B000BOH98G", "B000AJJNFE", "B000O77SN6", "B00005JLYW"], "bought_together": ["B000EHSVLY", "B000EHSVM8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000EHSVL4", "B000EHSVKK", "B0046XG48O", "B000EHSVLY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 154783}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 32.59, "brand": "20th Century Fox", "asin": "B00006RCNX", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RSRJ6FCWL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Buffy the Vampire Slayer - The Complete Third Season"}
{"description": "British cinema in the late 1950s and early 1960s turned out a series of  gently satirical films that mocked established institutions, andHeavens  Above!is the member of the group that turned its attention to religion.  Peter Sellers, in an unusually low-key performance that's all the better for  being underplayed, stars as a young vicar whose tendencies to interpret  Christian doctrines in his own individualistic way, rather than conform to  church traditions, leads to all kinds of chaos. He really believes, for example,  in taking from the rich to give the poor. It's a quietly funny film rather than  a festival of belly laughs, but the points it scores against religious  hypocrisies are deftly and persuasively made, and it's one of those British  comedies in which squadrons of wonderful character actors fill out the minor  roles. Any fan of vintage British comedy will find a cast including Irene Handl,  Eric Sykes, Miriam Karlin, Ian Carmichael, Cecil Parker, and Roy Kinnear hard to  resist, and there are also very brief appearances from Derek Nimmo and Rodney  Bewes at the beginning of their careers.--Andy Medhurst", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B001LXIDUY", "B00007AJEC", "B004H9X4CG", "B00007AJEA", "B0007XBKPE", "B00012FWZU"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001LXIDUY", "B000MEYKC8", "B00007AJEC"]}, "price": 12.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 200490}, "asin": "B00007AJE7", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51BKGRAYXYL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Heavens Above!"}
{"description": "Notoriously, and entirely appropriately, the original outline for Doug Naylor and Rob Grant's comedy sci-fi seriesRed Dwarfwas sketched on the back of a beer mat. When it finally appeared on British television in 1988, the show had clearly stayed true to its roots, mixing jokes about excessive curry consumption with affectionate parodies of classic sci-fi. Indeed, one of the show's most endearing and enduring features is its obvious respect for genre conventions, even as it gleefully subverts them. The scenario owes something to Douglas Adams's satiricalHitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, something toThe Odd Couple, and a lot more to the slacker sci-fi of John Carpenter'sDark Star. Behind the crew's constant bickering there lurks an impending sense that life, the universe, and everything are all someone's idea of a terrible joke.Later seasons broadened the show's horizons until at last its premise was so diluted as to be unrecognizable, but in the six episodes of the first season, the comedy is witty and intimate, focusing on characters and not special effects. Slob Dave Lister (Craig Charles) is the last human alive after a radiation leak wipes out the crew of the vast mining vesselRed Dwarf(Episode 1, \"The End\"). He bums around the spaceship with the perpetually uptight and annoyed hologram of his dead bunkmate, Arnold Rimmer (Chris Barrie, the show's greatest comedy asset), and a creature evolved from a cat (dapper Danny John Jules). They are guided rather haphazardly by Holly, the worryingly thick main computer (lugubrious Norman Lovett).--Mark Walker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00007AP32", "B0000WN0ZA", "B0000WN0ZU", "B0006Z2L0G", "B0006Z2L0Q", "B000EU1Q4U", "B000BVM1TQ", "B0026P3HPW", "B009Z59778", "B000BHHVNQ", "B002FQJT0Y", "B001DF681G", "B009Z5BPYG", "B002GP7ZV4", "B007AFC0W4", "B002BAW6FE", "B006LPHY6G", "0140174664", "B001NOMOS8", "B001YYQA0K", "B00006LPCK", "B002EOVX9W", "B00443FN1A", "B002GP7ZVO", "B002LFQIMQ", "B006LPHY5C", "B002LFPAUM", "B00FAVRFXE", "B002BAW6GI", "B0007G89FU", "0140143882", "B002LFQIMG", "B00004Z4TO", "B008R52LA2", "B0000DZSYB", "B00272NJ7K", "B000GI3RZ6", "B002LFQIN0", "B002BAW6H2", "B002BAW6FY", "B002D1XKB0", "B0000UJL96", "B000FIHN8O", "B001T46TCE", "0451452011", "B00HCK7THS", "B001AGXEBU", "B00008KA57", "B003L77GWE", "B001D2WUGG", "B002BIULNA", "B001QCWQ62", "B00BD6K54G", "B00GOC74QG", "B001Q9ECNA", "B000BP86Y6", "B001QCWQ5S", "B005PPMHO2", "B00064AME4", "B00AZMFJYA", "0140171509", "B0009X75J2", "B000Z7G87C", "B00005A1SY", "B00009MEJT", "B000HWZ4HU", "B004EXWGHY", "B004QOB8TS", "B000AYELJ2", "B000067FPC", "B001HUWQEA", "B000AJJNFE", "B000127LW2", "B00022FWEU", "B000RO9PTQ", "B00ECXJC28", "B002I9Z8BM", "B001QCWQ58", "B00D3ZJFBO", "B0000AQS0F", "B005SH65GI", "B001C71IGA", "B002I9Z8AS", "B000777I88", "B001O4C6NA", "B000LC4ZI0", "B00129W6LE", "B000QRI1GW", "B0089AD8IO", "B000KGGIRI", "B000FJH5MC", "B004QOB8SO"], "bought_together": ["B00007AP32", "B0000WN0ZA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000GI3RZ6", "B009Z59778", "B0006Z2L0G", "B0026P3HPW"]}, "price": 13.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 90398}, "asin": "B00007AP31", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51F8ZQYDF9L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Red Dwarf: Series I"}

{"description": "S.W.A.T.crams onto a single DVD two commentary tracks, deleted scenes, featurettes, and excellent technical specs, including an exciting sound mix.  The first commentary track is a combination of informative but subdued remarks by director Clark Johnson spliced with a track by Samuel L. Jackson and five other actors (but not Colin Farrell) together.  The comments by the actors are infrequent, raucous, and forgettable. There's also a commentary track by four of the writers, who discuss how they were writingS.W.A.T.when the North Hollywood shootout (on which the opening scene is based) took place, and what writers think about actors who improvise. The making-of featurette gives plenty of exposure and credit to the real-life S.W.A.T. officers who helped with the film, and a featurette on the original TV series is interesting, even though it's basically an advertisement for theDVD set.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004H2P6II", "B00005JLX2", "B0015LPRZQ", "B0025KVKDO", "B00005JLQN", "B0001XAQ9Q", "B00005JL3K", "B000J4QWMC", "B000A2X3MU", "B002ZG99N6", "B00275EGWY", "B000FJGR76", "B002AT8K9W", "B000KX0HFK", "B00AEBB86A", "B004LGGXG4", "B001MZ5W3M", "B000G5SILC", "B001BP4K22", "B00004Z1FX", "B000QUCRB4", "B000HC2M2K", "6304806434", "B00003CXNY", "B000TJBN80", "B000KLQUSU", "0790736411", "B00HLTD3ZW", "1558908315", "B000VG66XS", "B00016MSV2", "B002ZG994U", "B004V8W52S", "B008E70EES", "B000065U1N", "B000X1Z0C4", "B0000VJG72", "B00004Z4WR", "B0007W7I4W", "0767803434", "B0010YVCB6", "B00005JKTP", "B0034G4OUO", "B00005QW6V", "6304698747", "B000K7UBSO", "B000FFL2G6", "B000F8DV1M", "B004EPYZUS", "B000274T94", "B00004STUL", "B002VWNIEA", "B000095WW8", "B00000FZL2", "B00ECXJBN8", "B0000B1OFL", "B00AEFY0XE", "B00562I40K", "0792835727", "B0009KA7XG", "B000BTITKS", "B000KGGIZK", "B00009ZPUA", "B0002IQMAM", "B0058ZPNBI", "B005LAIIPS", "B001QB9H10", "B001O5LVVC", "B001UV4XGA", "B004HO6HWA", "B00BUC4TJ0", "B00BEIYHO2", "B004P3ENLA", "B0006GANOQ", "B0019EXZY4", "B00000G3PA", "B0013J55B6", "B002GHHHL0", "B00004STDN", "B0009DWL8W", "6304711891", "B0034G4ORC", "B003Y5H5FG", "B00BB67UNW", "B001ILHY1I", "B004EPYZQC", "B002AT8KA6", "0790732149", "B00260HH2G", "B000CQLZ8S", "B005LAIH2C", "B002ZG97RE", "B003M987QK", "B000A0GP0Y", "B000KX0HIW", "B00009L1TA", "B00005V9I6", "0783240295", "B000P0J0BK", "B0000542CK"], "bought_together": ["B004H2P6II"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00008YLVB", "B000M341QE", "B005CFBYW6", "B003Q6D2B4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 24979}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.98, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B00008EYA5", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51BEAR8WT7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "S.W.A.T.

She's a magazine writer assigned to date a guy, make all the mistakes girls make that drive guys away (being clingy, talking in baby-talk and so on) and records the process like a sociological experiment. However, the guy she picks-- Matthew McConaughey--is an advertising executive who's just bet that he can make a woman fall in love with him in 10 days; if he succeeds, he'll win a huge account that will make his career. The set-up is completely absurd, but the collision of their efforts to woo and repel creates some pretty funny scenes. McConaughey's easy charm and Hudson's lightweight impishness play well together and the plot, though strictly Hollywood formula, chugs along efficiently. At moments Hudson seems to channel her mother, Goldie Hawn, to slightly unnerving effect. --Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00007E2F5", "B00003CXSM", "B00AEFXWXI", "B0012KJ0DK", "B002K0WBXW", "B0015I2RT8", "B00164KYV4", "B004EPZ070", "B0000897EG", "B00447L4KA", "B002P413IC", "B00005JN3W", "B002ZG988M", "B000MQC9H4", "B002ZG989G", "B00AEBB8NS", "B000A343RI", "B001TUZD8O", "B00006ZXSL", "B00005O5CM", "B001OQCUZM", "B004EPZ0BG", "B00081U7HC", "B004SIP9X8", "B003Y5H574", "B001Y8DJVE", "6304765266", "B00008NRI7", "B000YDBPAM", "B0038N9X3Q", "B00AEBB8R4", "B00AEFYQE2", "B000683VI4", "B0000524E5", "B00AEBB9WI", "B00AEFXO8Q", "B00AEFYM2S", "B000YAA68C", "B00AMEZDJW", "B0007PLLBU", "B00006ZXSK", "B002ZG984Q", "B0009OL7Z4", "B002ZG9968", "B0036TGSIK", "B000023VTP", "B003BV8ICC", "B00AEFYWQY", "B00AEBB8YW", "B000J4QW7W", "B003B3V0N4", "B00005JG6N", "B0000DIXDR", "B004SEUJK0", "B005LAIGSM", "B000ELJAEM", "B0001Z3TXE", "B000957O82", "B001OQCUYI", "B004SIP9RO", "B004SIP8LG", "B003NHRIVQ", "B0013D8LHC", "B00AKGG6JS", "B00008WJD6", "B003Y5H524", "B000J103OI", "B0050MB584", "B00006ZXSO", "B00006FMUW", "B000HEWEE4", "6305236569", "B000XJD33O", "B002ZG99UE", "B0035Q637K", "B00466HN7M", "B001L9EXTS", "B00386EZKE", "B001C5LLQ4", "076780421X", "B000J3OTSM", "B000E6EHE0", "B004LWZW9C", "B00005JM55", "B000EMGICS", "B000CEV3KU", "B008JFUUIA", "B00003CXMP", "B000P0J0DS", "B000TZJBPQ", "B0000AOV4I", "B005Z9MFRC", "B0000D8L1K", "B000HCPS94", "B00E8RKHWW", "B00AEFY4CG", "B004SIP8JI", "B0001AVZA8", "B005LAIGXW", "B000Y7U93C"], "bought_together": ["B00007E2F5", "B002K0WBXW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002K0WBXW", "B002ZG989G", "B00007E2F5", "B00447L4KA"]}, "price": 14.16, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 346003}, "asin": "B00008KDGZ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/512083xZEbL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days"}

{"description": "The second season ofAngelsaw the cult vampire show finally stand on its own fromBuffy the Vampire Slayer, assembling all the members of the show's core cast, transferring the action to a fashionably run-down L.A. hotel, and bringing in a fewBuffycharacters from Angel's history to further establish the moody vampire's own mythology. Moving their Angel Investigations to posher digs, Angel (David Boreanaz), Cordelia (Charisma Carpenter), and Wesley (Alexis Denisof) were soon joined by street fighter (J. August Richards)&#x96;-and by street fighter, of course we mean demon street fighter. But just as this group was solidifying, up popped Angel's old love, Darla (the fantastic Julie Benz), freshly arrived in L.A. from a hell dimension&#x85; just in time to be turned into a vampire again by her old cohort, Drusilla (Juliet Landau), and lure Angel into abandoning his newly formed team. It was the best and worst of times forAngelin its second year, for while the basis was being set for the show's stellar third and fourth seasons, dramatic tension was diluted by Angel's going solo and the necessary (but plot-debilitating) flashbacks to various points in Angel's history. However, just when it seemed everything was about to fly out the window,Angel's creative team threw its characters for a loop--literally--by transporting them to the demon dimension of Pylea, a medieval-style fantasyland populated by monsters and humans alike. It shouldn't have worked, as hokey as it was... but it did, thanks to crack storytelling, sharp dialogue, and the sheer joy the actors unleashed, especially the gifted and fiendishly funny Carpenter. The second half of the season also saw the addition of two ofAngel's best characters: the horned Lorne (Andy Hallett), a green demon with a penchant for karaoke, and Fred (Amy Acker), a physicist trapped in Pylea who helped the gang engineer their escape.

{"description": "Jake Busey steps into Rutger Hauer's cowboy boots to remind viewers about the dangers of picking up hitchhikers in this sequel to the 1986 thriller. Though suggested, it's unclear whether Busey's black-clad hitcher is actually supposed to be Hauer, who blackmailed teen driver Jim (C. Thomas Howell) for a series of killing 17 years earlier, but he makes life miserable all the same for the grown Jim (Howell again), now an trauma-plagued cop, and his girlfriend (Kari Wuhrer) as they drive through Texas (played here by Canada, and well photographed by George Mooradian). But where the originalHitcherwas a taut exercise in suspense, executive producer Charles Meeker's script is simply a retread of its predecessor's highlights, including the infamous \"drawn and quartered\" scene, and gives the three leads little to do. Busey tries hard, but lacks Hauer's formidable presence, which may disappoint fans of the original; undemanding frightfest aficionados might enjoy this best.--Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00CDV4RS0", "B000NO3DLG", "B00JF5GAIW", "B000AM4P9K", "B001DZOC64", "B000063UR5", "B001KEHAEO", "B004EI2NP4", "B0002O7XW2", "B008G4T7W4", "6305120021", "B00CERJI5U", "B00DMUFXOS", "B000Q66Q8I", "B002JT69OG", "B0013LL2YS", "B008JFUNYG", "B0013527K2", "B001AV3BWM", "B00CPN933U", "B00BCMT2BI", "B000I2J68M", "B000G1ALDY", "B005CFBZQ6", "B000ARFPMQ", "B004A2AN5G", "B000K7UC2Y", "B000WC389G", "B00018D42W", "B000XUUQQK", "B00DMUFYZQ", "B00CAATSME", "B000KJU1KK", "B0007WFXL2", "B00ESZZOLI", "B000JLQQ94", "B008DL4LN0", "B00A429Y9M", "B00030AZCK", "B000PMFRYC", "B0002Y4T7O", "B000QQJ3Q0", "157362408X", "B00DOZNGC2", "B0002B14UW", "B00AEFYDM2", "B0001FGBWK", "B00E0FW07W", "B009IV2Z7S", "B0000AZT78", "0783223609", "B007CZ3E7C", "B0052DP1RC", "B00D3LA6M0", "B002E2QH7W", "B001L9EXUC", "B005GT3X68", "B0006Z2LH4", "B00111YM56", "B00068WOH8", "B00275EHFU", "B003ZZ7TPG", "B001AIQ14A", "B002ZG99IG", "B000TGJ80S", "B0001VTPWC", "B0001VTPW2", "B0021L8UXK", "B00AEFXKZ8", "B004XIWRW4", "B000H1RFXM", "B000FA57U8", "B000063UR3", "B000FS9FEY", "B0002S9QUA", "B000IMUYJM", "B00B04NJE4", "B0001ZX088", "B001DJLD0S", "B00008DDVY", "B00002CGG2", "B002LMSWN2", "B001D2WU9I", "B001KEHAE4", "B009IV2Z3M", "B000RGN2JI", "0790739313", "6305238065", "B004AC6PMG", "B001NPD9LS", "B002ZG983M", "B001DJLD1W", "B009AMALGM", "079284646X", "B0000C2IWM", "B0031U8OEK", "B00BEIYGT8", "B00BLF9FOK", "B004SEUJPA", "B002OPZ2UC"], "bought_together": ["B00CDV4RS0", "B000NO3DLG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00CDV4RS0", "B000NO3DLG", "B001DZOC64", "B00006JU6Z"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 195600}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.39, "brand": "Universal Studios", "asin": "B00009LIA5", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516NSYZ775L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Hitcher II: I've Been Waiting"}
{"description": "Nobody would argue with the thought that Sissy Spacek is the perfect heroine of Stephen King's scary tale of teenage telekinesis. But in a pinch, Angela Bettis, the star of this 2002 TV remake, fills Spacek's bloody shoes very well.

Her transformation from doormat to vengeful prom queen remains surefire wish fulfillment for anyone who ever felt a misfit in high school. Despite Bettis's intensity, it's difficult to justify remakingCarriewhenBrian De Palma's 1976 versionis enshrined as a classic of its kind (especially given the pedestrian TV-movie production values on display here).

As their conversation  begins, Kan intercuts scenes from Chioyoko's films with her memories of pursuing  the mysterious artist she met as a young girl. Accompanied by his blas&eacute;  cameraman, Tashibana finds himself within Chioyoko's memories and films,  alternately observing and aiding the woman he adores. Kon's skillful direction and  subtle use of color strengthen the intriguing story: Chioyoko's memories are  rendered in shades of gray, with hints of muted color highlighting the overall  composition.

{"description": "Harrison Ford lends his solid, perpetually disgruntled presence toHollywood Homicide, an action comedy in which he's paired with the squinty eyes and peaches-and-cream complexion of Josh Hartnett (Black Hawk Down,O). Radical French filmmaker Jean-Luc Godard would appreciate this complete deconstruction of the buddy-cop flick genre; basic cinematic elements (mismatched partners, a hard-ass superior riding them, arguments about who's going to drive, arguments about intuition vs. diligent detective work, the bad cop who killed Hartnett's father, etc.) have been scrambled and slapped together with no concern for coherence, making clear their innately artificial nature. Sex scenes and car chases come out of nowhere and disappear without consequence, providing arbitrary visual stimulus. During shootouts, it's impossible to tell who got killed or why, underscoring a basic doubt about the purpose of making movies likeHollywood Homicide. It's rare for a mainstream movie to be so daringly (if perhaps accidentally) avant-garde.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000F8DV1M", "B001DJLD08", "B00AEFYXJ0", "B001UDS4BS", "B00AEFYENK", "6305213283", "B00AEBB9UK", "B00AEBBA2W", "B00441GYZQ", "B00096S4DK", "B00005LB88", "6305133476", "0792844017", "0767803434", "B00AEFYW64", "B002ZG98FU", "B000K2UVZM", "B0045HCJ8K", "B0045HCJFS", "B000FKO5QK", "0767821513", "B00067BBMS", "B00AEBB9NM", "B002ZG97J2", "B00008EYA5", "B00005JLX2", "B000085EF5", "B00AEBB8YW", "B00008EY9G", "B004SEUJ9Q", "B004P7CN7W", "B000BYA4J2", "B0015OKWL2", "B004EPYZSK", "B002AT8K9W", "B0007IO6NM", "0767802578", "B001NY4WYC", "6304698747", "0790732149", "B00008K76V", "B00009MEKO", "B00005UQ9T", "B004EPYZT4", "0767818024", "B003LR5BD0", "B003A12WBQ", "0790731460", "6305263248", "B00004WG2F", "B000P0J06U", "B0087DFIYA", "B00008OE4W", "B000MGBLTQ", "B0034G4ORC", "B0019EXZY4", "6305133468", "B0000AZT79", "B0000B1OFL", "B002ZG96ZC", "B001OST0LW", "B000OYAT3U", "B00005R5GM", "B000LC3ICE", "B00E1HIWXU", "B00260HH2G", "B00BTYOYG2", "B001UV4XGA", "B0000A9GHD", "B003AWRM9W", "B004P7CMVE", "B000EHSVOG", "B00005N5S5", "B000XT1P4S", "B000069DOB", "B001BGS17Q", "B003Q6D2B4", "B001GMAVGE", "B00AEFY6PQ", "B00AEFXT1S", "B001VLBDD0", "B004A8ZWSS", "B000YDMPC4", "0792844874", "B001GKJ2E8", "B00AEBB9UU", "B000JYW5BE", "B000XJD34I", "B008CRB1HY", "B008JFURII", "B002AS464Q", "B0001Z37HM", "B000BFH2C8", "B00008K76W", "B000P0J08S", "0783229364", "B001SN78JO", "B00AEBB95K", "B00BUAEYVK", "B0045HCJ8A"], "bought_together": ["6305213283"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AU740H2", "B001UDS4BS", "B001DJLD08", "B00005LB88"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 45508}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 15.0, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B0000B00KB", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51XVMJ3CPGL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Hollywood Homicide"}

{"description": "By 1939, when the earliest films in this collection were made, Mickey Mouse was the most famous cartoon character in the world. The unsuccessful hunter in \"The Pointer\" (1939) and the irrepressible magician in \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\" (1940) rank among his finest performances. In both films, he sparkles with vitality.  But as Mickey grew more popular, more restrictions were placed on what he could do, and the character grew dull. Those restrictions become obvious when the viewer compares these films with the shorts onWalt Disney Treasures: Mickey Mouse in Living Color. In \"Mickey's Birthday Party\" (1942), he clowns and stumbles through a comic dance routine, but it feels like he's working for the laughs. In 1936, when a more impish Mickey danced with a deck of cards in \"Thru the Mirror,\" the fun came from the stylish grace of his movements: That Mickey didn't need to mug for the camera. In the later films, Mickey serves as a genial straight man, with Pluto and other side characters supplying the comedy.A new generation of animators faced the same problems and restrictions when they tried to revive the character in \"Mickey's Christmas Carol\" (1983) and \"The Prince and the Pauper\" (1990). The extras include some deleted animation from \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice,\" and the five opening sequences from the \"Mickey Mouse Club\" (1955), the last time Walt Disney provided the character's voice.

{"description": "Spanning two decades and countless light years of interstellar adventure,Star Trek: The Motion Pictures Collectionis a testament to the enduring goodwill of Gene Roddenberry's optimistic sci-fi concept. Long beforeStar Warssparked an explosion of big-screen science fiction, Roddenberry had planned a secondStar TrekTV series; the project fizzled, but its pilot script evolved into the first film in Paramount's most lucrative movie franchise. Despite its sluggish pace and bland \"pajama\" costuming,Star Trek: The Motion Picture(1979) offered a welcomed reunion of the \"ClassicTrek\" cast, packed with Douglas Trumbull's still-dazzling special effects. Trekkers were even more ecstatic whenThe Wrath of Khan(1982) revived the spirit of the original series, even though director Nicholas Meyer was aTrekneophyte. With Leonard Nimoy directing,The Search for Spock(1984) began whereKhanleft off, with a thrilling (albeit contrived) obligation to resurrect the formerly ill-fated Mr. Spock.A box-office smash, Nimoy'sThe Voyage Home(1986)  is the franchise's most accessible adventure--a high point offset by William Shatner's comparatively dreadfulStar Trek V: The Final Frontier(1989). Meyer (and his penchant for quoting Shakespeare) returned forThe Undiscovered Country(1991), a conspiracy thriller that put the series back on track, inspiring fans to invoke the \"even number\" rule in rating their franchise favorites.Generations(1994) gracefully passed the torch to TV'sThe Next Generation, bidding farewell to Captain Kirk with honor and integrity intact. Highlighted by the evolving humanity of Brent Spiner's android Lt. Cmdr. Data,First Contact(1996) exploredStar Trekhistory with a logical (hint) surprise encounter, andInsurrection(1998) provided an adequate expansion of the successfulNextGenseries. Taken as a whole, these ten films demonstrate the consistent vitality of Roddenberry's original vision, stoking any Trekker's appetite for \"ongoing missions\" inNemesisand beyond.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002HWRYJE", "B00AZMFJYA", "B001DHXT6G", "B000AOEMXM", "B000HEWEJ4", "B000RZIGVS", "B00062RCC6", "B001DHXT3Y", "B00062IDDS", "B008JFUS0U", "1613778953", "B00000ILDH", "B002GSXKN8", "B000VDDDY6", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B008JFUNHI", "B00005JKHP", "B00CTSDDVO", "B00F3L8P26", "B00JL6L4WC", "B001E75QH0", "B002945DU2", "B00BTYMPUY", "B000P6XQ50", "B0077T5SWC", "B002I9Z8I0", "6305181721", "B0017VG69U", "B002EL4RLQ", "B0000UJL96", "B001TH16CE", "B0001O3YA8", "6305428263", "B00BEZTMFY", "B000E6ESEY", "B000H6SXW4", "B005BUA1JY", "B000286RR0", "B002MU4NM2", "B00E5G03I4", "B00GX7D5G0", "B001DJLD1M", "B005SH62X4", "B002PQ7JQK", "B002A6FIXG", "B001CQONOA", "B008JFUPFI", "B00DYEN6XC", "B00061QJSK", "B009WH5KC0", "B009LDD4V4", "B000VXWK86", "B000WC3864", "B001TH16CO", "B000REQQGQ", "B000063V8R", "B002I9Z8GM", "B000M341R8", "B000ASDFH2", "B002U0KHME", "B000CEXFYW", "B005J9ZFQG", "B008JFUO72", "B004XM38CS", "B00BMJ7ZKG", "B00A3717C0", "B0054OGQM8", "B005BYBZKY", "B00006BH8G", "B00HERGM86", "B000BW7QWW", "B002I9Z8EO", "B0083SBMBM", "B00005Y1NF", "B006U1JD5G", "B007ZFR67I", "B00471JSRE", "B001XW7ICW", "B00A8MGIZG", "B008JFUQZ2", "B000JLTRHW", "B000PHX8RA", "B008412UQ4", "B0000AQS0F", "B00C6ACVD6", "B00EC9UHVM", "B00D2D1WVI", "B00DY9528Y", "B008HUSFTS", "B000U1ZV62", "B008DVJNTW", "B000P0J0A6", "B00DJYJWVW", "B007REV4T8", "B008JFURII", "B001EXE2Y2", "B001TH16DS", "B007KFZ85K", "B002HRF68A"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002I9Z8I0", "B002I9Z8GM", "B001DHXT6G", "B00AZMFJYA"]}, "price": 69.5, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 227123}, "asin": "B0000CABK8", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51K147X2XGL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Star Trek - The Motion Pictures Collection (10 Films)"}
{"description": "The third time's the, for want of a better word, charm forSouth Parkon DVD. Instead of mere episode intros as on the first two boxed sets, Trey Parker and Matt Stone finally oblige us with actual episode commentary, or, as they call it, \"commentary-mini.\" On this optional audio track, Trey and Matt goof for about five minutes or so at the top of each episode, certifying some as favorites (\"Tweek vs. Craig,\" \"Jewbilee,\" and \"Worldwide Recorder Concert,\" which is described as \"a reverse after-school special from hell\"), championing others popularly dismissed bySouth Park's otherwise loyal fans (\"Jakovasaurs,\" \"Sexual Harassment Panda\"), and provocatively dismissing all ofseason 2.The third season was frantically produced simultaneously with the feature film,South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut. This was the season, Trey proclaims, \"whereSouth Parkturned the corner... and became good (as far as we were concerned).\" Among their most inspired conceits is the so-called \"Meteor Shower Party\" trilogy, three episodes that unfold over the course of one night, each focusing on a different kid. \"Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery\" pays homage to Hanna-Barbera-style animation andScooby-Doo, recasting Korn as the Mystery Inc gang. \"Rainforest Shmainforest,\" featuring a game Jennifer Aniston, cuts rainforest crusaders down to size. \"Mr. Hankey's Christmas Classics\" takes its irreverent cue from thealbum of the same name, and contains an outrageously obscure reference to the 1978 made-for-TVStar Wars Holiday Special. Throughout the season,South Parkis, as usual, a gleeful equal-opportunity offender, but the show's true gonzo spirit is truly illustrated in such surreal touches as the employment of live action in \"Tweek vs. Craig,\" the singing of \"The Morning After\" backwards to save Chef from the spell of \"The Succubus,\" and theSeinfeld-worthy argument over whether the term should be \"pirate ghosts\" or \"ghost pirates\" in \"Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery.\"--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00023P49M", "B0001ZWLVU", "B00023P49C", "B0006Z2L2Y", "B000ADWCYY", "B000CNESM6", "B000FSME2Y", "B000KLQUMQ", "B000R7I3XC", "B0018O5WUU", "B001O0TWXG", "B0030Y11UG", "B004MLEYTG", "B006W93ELK", "B009SQ9Q5M", "B000USUA8E", "B000022TSW", "B000LW7OKQ", "B00AEBB8TM", "B001O0TWXQ", "B000ZT0S9O", "B00105308I", "B006W93EM4", "B0030Y11NS", "B004MLEYT6", "B009SQ9Y7M", "B000OPO0LQ", "B008412UKA", "B00008YGRV", "B0000AQS81", "B000AQ68Z0", "B0012018OE", "B000E6ES9O", "B003VJTGKW", "B000083C6V", "B003DZX46G", "B0001MZ7KA", "B000HT3P6U", "B000RO6JZO", "0762435615", "B001CQONKO", "B009WSJHD2", "B000UAE7UE", "B00G4RCB14", "B001VFM0ZG", "B006IOAHTQ", "B0002XVQT4", "B000E0OE3K", "B000NNK4DM", "B00008YGRS", "B007ZFR67I", "B003L77G7Y", "B0007PAM06", "B000P2A6CA", "B007KFZ8AA", "B00G4RCF60", "B000067DNE", "B00LBHOCHS", "B000B5XOR0", "6305301700", "B007KFZ7YM", "B00CJEKA2I", "B0002WZRSG", "030789682X", "B00008YGRZ", "B000F9T700", "B003W5TO70", "B00005JM3G", "B001RIZ7OI", "B007KFZ85K", "B003CN5B7E", "B001G0MFFG", "B00C28X8IY", "B00000J8BV", "B0002NY8XA", "B007KFZ88M", "B00AEFZ8OY", "B0012KSUTA", "B00002RAO2", "B00330WP6Q", "B000ABKHZC", "B008412UQ4", "B00CJEK7GW", "B007Z3UUF0", "B00E0FW054", "B000GPYMZS", "B006IOAHPK", "B003XJABTK", "B007KFZ7UQ", "B003V3FVQ6", "B004QP7WTC", "B0001LJBTE", "B0007CILMA", "B00K8HAJN8", "B000B5XOWU", "0762435704", "B00003CXS7", "B00H3JJCW8", "B001MT7ZI8"], "bought_together": ["B00023P49M", "B00023P49C"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00023P49M", "B00023P49C", "B0006Z2L2Y", "B0001ZWLVU"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 16296}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 14.12, "brand": "Paramount", "asin": "B0000CABL2", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51rGlTEGXrL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "South Park: Season 3"}

{"description": "Director Robert Duvall (THE APOSTLE) weaves the disparate worlds of murder and dance in this quirky and sometimes impressionistic comedy drama. John (Robert Duvall), an old-school Coney Island-area hit man, is offered a lucrative job in Argentina. He doesn't really want to take it, and his reluctance to leave his beloved stepdaughter Jenny (Katherine Micheaux Miller) and miss her birthday party fuels his obstinacy. But, assured he will be back in time, he takes the job. Once in Buenos Aries, the assassination plot begins to unfold, then sputter, and finally falls apart as the target fails to show up. Needless to say, John misses Jenny's big day, and to get his mind off of things, he catches a traditional Argentinean tango performance. With a reverence for American dance, John is totally blown away by this thrillingly expressive form, and infiltrates the tango circuit through Manuela (Luciana Pedraza), a glowing but modest partner. She and her sister escort John through the history and motion that is tango, while in the meantime the assassination plot picks back up as the target finally returns to Buenos Aries. Much like the dance it depicts, the film navigates between one world of murderous intrigue and conspiracy, and the other of sensual elegance and high-art aesthetics. Duvall also bridges the gulf between these worlds with an inimitable performance", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 351572}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.61, "brand": "", "asin": "B0000DI880", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/418DP7PK5KL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Assassination Tango (Slip) [VHS]"}

{"description": "TheAlien Quadrilogyis a nine-disc boxed set devoted to the fourAlienfilms. Although previously available on DVD as theAlien Legacy, here they have been repackaged with vastly more extras and with upgraded sound and picture. For anyone who hasn't been in hypersleep for the last 25 years, this series needs no introduction, though for the first time each film now comes in both original and \"special edition\" form.Alien(1979) was so perfect it didn't need fixing, and Ridley Scott's 2003 director's cut is fiddling for the sake of fiddling. Watch it once, then return to the majestic, perfectly paced original. Conversely, the special edition of James Cameron'sAliens(1986) is the definitive version, though it's nice to finally have the theatrical cut on DVD for comparison. Most interesting is the alternativeAlien 3(1992). This isn't a \"director's cut\"--David Fincher refused to have any involvement with this release--but a 1991 work-print that runs 29 minutes longer than the theatrical version, and has now been restored, remastered, and finished off with (unfortunately) cheap new CGI. Still, it's truly fascinating, offering a different insight into a flawed masterpiece. The expanded opening is visually breathtaking, the central firestorm is much longer, and a subplot involving Paul McGann's character adds considerable depth to story. The ending is also subtly but significantly different.Alien: Resurrection(1997) always was a mess with a handful of brilliant scenes, and the special edition just makes it eight minutes longer.TheAlien Quadrilogyoffers the first and fourth films with DTS soundtracks, the others having still fine Dolby Digital 5.1 presentation. All four films sound fantastic, with much low-level detail revealed for the first time. Each is anamorphically enhanced at the correct original aspect ratio, and the prints and transfers are superlative. Every film offers a commentary track that lends insight into the creative process--though the Scott-only commentary and isolated music score from the firstAlienDVD release are missing here.Each movie is complemented by a separate disc packed with hours of seriously detailed documentaries (all presented in full-screen with clips letterboxed), thousands of photos, production stills, and storyboards, giving a level of inside information for the dedicated buff only surpassed by theLord of the Ringsextended DVD sets. A ninth DVD compiles miscellaneous material, including an hourlong documentary and even all the extras from the oldAlienlaserdisc. \"Exhaustive\" hardly beings to describe theAlien Quadrilogy, a set that establishes the new DVD benchmark for retrospective releases and looks unlikely to be surpassed for some time.--Gary S.

{"description": "Partly inspired by 1948'sThe Big Clockand its nominal 1987 remakeNo Way Out, the Denzel Washington thrillerOut of Timeis quite enjoyable if you ignore its implausible plotting. Like those earlier films, this reunion of Washington and hisDevil in a Blue Dressdirector Carl Franklin is about a man--in this case the police chief (Washington) of sleepy Banyan Key, Florida--who falls into a trap set by others, sinks into legal quicksand of his own making, and must race the clock to extricate himself from a series of incriminating setbacks. The Florida setting adds welcome character to the potboiler plot, and Washington's screen-cred makes it easy to overlook the absurdities of rookie writer David Collard's screenplay. Eva Mendes is sharp and sensible as Washington's estranged wife (do you think they'll reconcile for a happy ending?), and the talented John Billingsley--whose portrayal of \"Dr. Phlox\" on TV'sEnterpriseis vastly underrated--is a constant delight as Washington's medical examiner, beer buddy and wily co-conspirator. It's hardly a classic, butOut of Timegoes well with a big tub of popcorn.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JPD0", "B000GFLKF8", "B00005JN0W", "B000244GCC", "B002LMV7R0", "6304884400", "B002VWNIEA", "B00005JKWX", "B000OT6V0K", "B005LAIGRS", "0783240295", "B0050MB4OO", "6304765258", "B00BTYOYG2", "B002ZG99TA", "B00005JA9F", "B0006210ZG", "B0000542CJ", "078324228X", "0767818075", "B002CPMB9O", "B002ZG997C", "B00AFEXRME", "B00441GZ1Y", "B002GHHHN8", "B00096S49Y", "B000N60HAO", "B00BEIYN9Q", "B005LAIGLE", "B002AT8K9W", "B00005JLRZ", "B00125WAWS", "B003BV8I3Q", "B0001VTPUO", "B008E70EES", "B0013J55B6", "B0007KZQAM", "B001JV5AZE", "B002O3Z4WK", "0800141806", "B000F8DV1M", "B002NZK5UU", "B00AEFXT1S", "B002AT8KAG", "B00BB67UNW", "B00J5G1P2W", "B002DU39GW", "B000G5SILC", "B00441GYXI", "0767810872", "B000ZS8GWQ", "B008FCX2D2", "B00AEBB86A", "B00008EYA5", "B00DZP1C2W", "B001UV4XRY", "0790730979", "6305428115", "0790736411", "6305161933", "B0006GAI5U", "B00BEIYHO2", "B008B9JTLI", "0783229402", "B001KRVLCI", "B003L20IG0", "B008JFUNKU", "B00AEBB8LA", "B00JA3RVG4", "B000VG66XS", "B0006GANOQ", "B00009L1TA", "B000R4SMCW", "B005OK721G", "B000EGDB10", "B00HEPC0TS", "B001L57ZYM", "B000069HZP", "B000P0J0EM", "B00007AJG1", "B00015YVDG", "6305505802", "B00005JMWP", "B004EPYZP8", "B00AEFXX9Q", "B000RO9Q7W", "B000244GCW", "B007EQR0D8", "B00J2MPZQG", "B00005JN0T", "B000QXDCLU", "B000P0I4O4", "B00005JNQA", "B005FUTBWS", "B00005JKQS", "0790742004", "B005YFGJFG", "B0002J4X2K", "B000N3SRO0", "B00013RC66"], "bought_together": ["B00005JPD0", "B00005JN0W"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005JN0W", "B00005JKWX", "B00005JPD0", "B000GFLKF8"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 29468}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.98, "brand": "Mgm/Ua Studios", "asin": "B0000VJG72", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51bhUc7kE0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Out of Time"}
{"description": "The hook ofThe Simple Lifeis irresistible: Two wealthy, pampered  young women go from upper-crust Los Angeles to an Arkansas farm to prove  that they can survive without their cell phones and credit cards. As hotel  heiress Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie (daughter of pop star Lionel)  blithely move in with a farm family, the Ledings, the culture clash  immediately becomes a train wreck; when asked to pluck chickens, Richie  declares, \"I'm not plucking anything but my eyebrows.\" They try to work a series of jobs (at a dairy farm, at a fast-food joint, at a livestock  auction), but they possess not a jot of work ethic or any sense of the  consequences of failure. Like the girls themselves, this 2003 reality show becomes both fascinating and repellent, comic and horrifying.

{"description": "For many fans, the Superman revisionist seriesSmallvilletruly hit its stride in its second season, when it shifted focus from traditional comic book conflicts to one of self-discovery for its hero, a teenage Clark Kent (Tom Welling).  Fans and first-timers can judge for themselves with this six-disc set, which compiles all 23 episodes and a decent selection of supplemental features. Whereas season 1 focused on Clark using his powers to combat a host of menaces &#xE0; la the WB's other big fantasy hit,Buffy the Vampire Slayer, season 2 delved into Clark's past and the extent of his super powers, most notably in the back-to-back \"Heat,\" in which he discovers his heat vision, and \"Red,\" in which red kryptonite in the high school class rings uncorks Clark's less-than-upstanding side. Other plot developments from the season that pull the series in interesting directions include the arrival of Dr. Helen Bryce (Emanuelle Vaugier), who becomes involved with Lex Luthor (Michael Rosenbaum), but the season's most significant moment comes during episode 17, \"Rosetta,\" in which Clark learns of his Kryptonian origins courtesy of a scientist, who, in an effective bit of casting, is played bySupermanfilm star Christopher Reeve.The complexity of the writing and issues dealt with in season 2 markedSmallvilleas a series with depth and drama worthy of its considerable fan following as well as a second boxed set; fittingly, the supplements in this set are more expansive than on the first one.  Producers Alfred Gough, Miles Millar, and Greg Beeman and cast members Welling, Rosenbaum, and Kristen Kreuk weigh in on commentary tracks for two episodes (\"Red\" and \"Rosetta\"), while a trio of short featurettes explore Christopher Reeves's appearance in \"Rosetta,\" the show's visual effects, and the amusing \"Wall of Weird\" web page maintained by Chloe (Allison Mack). The extras are rounded out by a handful of deleted scenes and a gag reel.--Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0002Y0QV2", "B00005JLKB", "B0009A5MUO", "B000G1R4SO", "B000N6SE4U", "B000X5SMXY", "B001FB4VZS", "B002JVWRDQ", "B003L77GG0", "B000R206FK", "B002JVWRE0", "B001FB4W02", "B0012U7IWU", "B003L77GGA", "B00G4SCKAK", "B00080ZG2O", "B00BBXSPES", "B000BT96EG", "B00BBXSPCK", "B00BGI086Q", "B004XWLN20", "B00DTRR43W", "B000EHSVLE", "B00ED2IBXE", "B000EHSVLY", "B000FP2OPY", "B000F8O2OM", "B00260HH30", "B00133QNRW", "B009LDCXNY", "B00JF5G8WU", "B000R7GKQE", "B001MVWRNE", "B00CN009Y2", "B000EU1Q2M", "1401241824", "B00DYEN6XC", "B004YM6JI2", "B0001CNRS4", "B000B8384G", "B000I0QLR8", "B004YM6JLO", "1401243096", "B006LG74Q0", "B002JVWRB8", "B001DJLD2G", "B000BT96FA", "B000EHSVKK", "B004YPED14", "B0000AKY3Q", "B000NOKFGW", "B0015RRNMA", "B002JVWRD6", "B0058YPGL6", "B002JVWRAO", "B00915G4IC", "B007MDB6Y2", "B0001EFTH4", "B000X5SPBI", "B00005Y71G", "B001EWDXT8", "B000EHSVL4", "B005SH63HO", "B000HT3P60", "B00F4FFO8E", "B004LROMWU", "B000I0QLS2", "B002JVWR4A", "B000CCBC9O", "B0018RKEQY", "B0018CWEYY", "1401246370", "B00280LZAE", "B00915G6SU", "B0002CX1M0", "B0012BS5XU", "B001FB4W0C", "B004HW7JNS", "B00IYRLUAU", "B0019LY5IM", "B0053O89IS", "B000IJ79UW", "B000RO6JYK", "B000SMNL92", "B00EIL7E9C", "B001FB4VXU", "B00E5I2MDQ", "B00IGVJGZK", "B00HQOFAKI", "B00AEBBA36", "B004FQX5B6", "B0052C5EI4", "B0000DIXDR", "B00GZ0ML4C", "B008JFUS0U", "B008X6N8KW", "B00DXLO0D6", "B00CL151G4", "B000EHSVG4", "B005IA9JQ8"], "bought_together": ["B0002Y0QV2", "B00005JLKB"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005JLKB", "B004XWLN20", "B0002Y0QV2", "B000N6SE4U"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 6376}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 23.99, "brand": "WEA", "asin": "B0001JXPPC", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51YFOkMz2tL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Smallville: Season 2"}

{"description": "By its fourth season,The Simpsonshad come far enough where Lisa could make a self-referential joke about Dustin Hoffman and Michael Jackson's pseudonymous guest voice appearances in seasons 2 and 3, respectively. In this season, no less than Elizabeth Taylor (in two episodes), Bette Midler, and even the reclusive Johnny Carson blessedThe Simpsonswith their iconic presences. Awhile back,Entertainment WeeklyrankedThe Simpsons' Top 25 best episodes ever. Five gems from season 4 cracked the top 12, including the (debatable) choice for No. 1, \"Last Exit to Springfield.\"  Other episodes that loom large in theSimpsonslegend are \"Mr. Plow\" (you know the jingle: \"Call Mr. Plow / That's my name / That name again is Mr. Plow\"), \"Marge vs. the Monorail,\" featuring aMusic Man-style extravaganza, and \"A Streetcar Named Marge,\" the episode that outraged New Orleans residents,  who heard their fair metropolis referred to as \"a city that the damned call home.\"The Simpsonssmartly subverts traditional family sitcom convention, but anyone who thinks the show doesn't have a heart is advised to watch \"I Love Lisa\" and \"New Kid on the Block,\" two fourth-season gems that absolutely nail the agony and ecstasy of unrequited crushes (\"You won't be needing this,\" a heartbroken Bart fantasizes his babysitter saying while dropkicking his heart into a wastebasket in \"New Kid\"). While theSimpsons' celebrated ensemble gets all the glory, we must pause now to praise the peerless writing staff, among them, George Meyer, Al Jean, Jon Vitti, John Swartzwelder, David Silverman, and Conan O'Brien. One can only marvel in astonishment at the alchemy that went into creating, week after week, such essential episodes as \"Kamp Krusty,\" \"Streetcar,\" the profane and profound \"Homer the Heretic,\" and \"Lisa the Beauty Queen\" (And that's just disc 1!). The animators, too, rose to the occasion, particularly in \"Itchy & Scratchy: The Movie,\" with its dead-on, ultra-violent sinking of the seminal Disney cartoon, \"Steamboat Willie.\" And another benchmark inThe Simpsons' rise to the TV pantheon: Its very first clip show.

Set in a Sydney, Australia suburb, the film is a quirky variation on the story of a misfit band trying to get a break with successful managers, clubs, recording studios, lovers, etc. Singer-guitarist Freddy (Kick Gurry) desperately maneuvers his group toward stardom, but his bandmates' internal struggles and the capriciousness of a powerful record executive (Marton Csokas) prove major stumbling blocks. So, too, is Freddy's deepening attraction to Kate (Maya Stange), girlfriend of his lead guitarist Joe (Brett Stiller), who in turn may be having a nervous breakdown via a dangerous side romance with a suicidal beauty (Yvette Duncan). Proyas enjoys his patches of darkness inGarage Days, but for the most part he's making his own, devil-may-careA Hard Day's Night.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00007L4LS", "B000CR7R7U"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 303290}, "asin": "B00023P4H4", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510280WRA7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Garage Days"}

Jon Stewart, Conan O'Brien, and Christopher Walken also weigh in via videotape, and Leary's fellow Emerson College alumnus Gina Gershon contributes a Broadway/burlesque musical number.

{"description": "Some boxed sets claim to be definitive, but are haphazardly selected. Not this one. Four of the five titles here can legitimately lay claim to being essentials in the film noir canon, and the fifth,The Set-Up, is a terrific boxing picture with a strong noir atmosphere. If you're a fan of noir--or have no idea what it's all about--this collection is a treat.Of course, none of these movies were made as \"film noir.\" The term was coined later by French critics to describe the moody, anxious feel of postwar American movies, especially the genre that highlighted duplicitous dames and susceptible men lost in the criminal jungle. Indeed, the titleThe Asphalt Jungleconveys the edgy urban arena of these pictures. That film is John Huston's masterly 1950 account of a heist, with Sterling Hayden the disenchanted, noirish hero. Joseph H. Lewis'sGun Crazy(1949) is one of the most supercharged (and sexually perverse) of noir films, with John Dall and Peggy Cummins as young criminals in love.Murder, My Sweet(1944) is a straight adaptation of Raymond Chandler's novelFarewell, My Lovely. Amid the film's shadowy chiaroscuro, former musical comedy star Dick Powell makes a career-changing transition as Chandler's private dick, Philip Marlowe.Out of the Pastputs Robert Mitchum (perhaps the quintessential noir actor) in trouble with gangster Kirk Douglas, complicated by classic femme fatale Jane Greer. Jacques Tourneur provides the evocative direction. AndThe Set-Upplays out an ingenious boxing tale in \"real time,\" superbly enacted by (former boxer) Robert Ryan.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000FI9OCW", "B003G9IT3C", "B0024FAG80", "B000PKG7DE", "B0024FAG8A", "B00097DY20", "B000B8384Q", "B00005RDRL", "B0007TKNKQ", "B002YNQEFG", "B00023P4GA", "B00005AUK9", "B0007ZEO8C", "B0087ZG7OI", "B002YNQEF6", "B000CNE088", "B000BQ5IXW", "B00023P4II", "B0007ZEO7S", "B003B3V0RA", "B00114XLTQ", "B00004XPPK", "B001CC7PM6", "B00007ELDG", "B00114XLUA", "B00004W229", "B00AQ6J5YA", "B000EXDSBQ", "6305999872", "B000087F79", "B000RXVND8", "B000PKG7CU", "B004C2523M", "B000LN6UHI", "B00012L786", "B000EXDSBG", "B002945DUM", "B0024FAG6W", "B0006Z2NS6", "B000B83846", "B000I2JDF8", "B001ASQ9OC", "B000GRUQJW", "B009X919UE", "B00004W19C", "B001QFFBAM", "B00008LDNZ", "B0009X7678", "B000BGH2NG", "B00I3C1T34", "B00D09AXUA", "B00457ZNS8", "B000FMGTQC", "B001CC7PLW", "B001OSC4G0", "B005152C9G", "B00023P4FQ", "B000KJTGFG", "B000YRY7VC", "B00006II5J", "B000B8380A", "B00114XLUU", "B008BSM1CI", "B000FFJYA2", "B00K6D1S7A", "B000A0GOEQ", "B00CVB6XF2", "B00ICWO1LC", "B000M2E3GI", "B00DBE97S8", "B0006HBV3C", "B000FKO3VM", "B0010KHOSA", "B0011FDVEK", "B00AEBBA7W", "B0006Z2NE0", "B0006UEVVS", "B000GIXLUW", "B0010KHOSU", "B0007TKNHY", "B0009X7682", "B000JLTRGI", "B006GVNHMA", "B000CNE08I", "0312180764", "1590201442", "B00AEFXN9G", "B0026ZQJP2", "B00AF4OTM6", "B00097DY0M", "B0000694WH", "0879101970", "B00C3ALM02", "B00EL6A7XE", "B008K1PXIK", "B000UJCAK4", "B00005AUKD", "B005H8G78O", "B00KIZY3XW"], "bought_together": ["B000FI9OCW", "B003G9IT3C"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000244EYW", "B0024FAG80", "B000244EX8", "B000244EWO"]}, "price": 34.96, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 15607}, "asin": "B000244F2S", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51LSoFvy1uL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Film Noir Classic Collection, Vol. 1 (The Asphalt Jungle / Gun Crazy / Murder My Sweet / Out of the Past / The Set-Up)"}

{"description": "Season 2 ofI Love Lucyincludes two of the most famous half-hours in television history. \"Job Switching,\" originally broadcast mid-September of 1952, is the crazy, battle-of-the-sexes episode in which husbands Ricky Ricardo (Desi Arnaz) and Fred Mertz (William Frawley) trade roles with wives Lucy (Lucille Ball) and Ethel (Vivian Vance), culminating in the men making a shambles of domestic chores while Lucy and Ethel take disastrous work at a chocolate factory. That's right: This is the show where the ladies have a Chaplinesque experience with a too-fast factory conveyor belt, forcing them to hide candies in their mouths, in their hats, and down their blouses lest a tough forewoman fire them for incompetence. A half-century later, the scene is still so fresh and funny it would grace any current sitcom. \"Lucy Goes to the Hospital,\" which received an amazing 71.7 rating on January 19, 1953, is the historic episode featuring the birth of Little Ricky and a load of wonderful slapstick. Other television series (The Dick Van Dyke Show) and movies (Nine Months) have tried to topLucy's time-to-go-to-the-hospital shenanigans, but there's nothing like the sight of Ricky and Fred falling all over themselves or Ricky showing up at the maternity ward (direct from a voodoo-themed show at the Tropicana) in witch doctor makeup.The other 31 episodes included inI Love Lucy: The Compete Second Seasonhave choice moments, too. \"Lucy Becomes a Sculptress\" finds the ever-ambitious redhead falling for empty flattery at an art-supply store and commencing an ill-advised career working in clay. Ricky agrees to bless this new endeavor if an art critic says she has talent, but Lucy tries to increase her chances by posing as a bust of herself--resulting in mayhem, of course. The usual running themes inI Love Lucy--Lucy's misguided desire to be a part of Ricky's musical career, and her penchant for disguising herself to investigate something--are all overThe Complete Second Season. \"Ricky Loses His Voice\" is a delightful piece in which Ricky's laryngitis inspires Lucy, the Mertzes, and an aging chorus line to put on a Tropicana spectacle, and \"Ricky Has Labor Pains\" finds Lucy and Ethel going undercover as male reporters to find out what happens at a stag party.  Lots to enjoy here, and the special features include bloopers, information about the guest cast, and snippets from Ball's radio show.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B008KZX7W0", "B008L3653O", "B008L3650M", "B008VNI9TC", "B008VNIBTK", "B008VNI9EW", "B00EC9UHZI", "B000EHQU08", "B0085Z6ZD8", "B0002NY8PI", "B000B8I9ZY", "B0007Y08P6", "B0000BV1XX", "B00274SIVK", "B00C6F61S2", "B00363WGIC", "B000AJJNJK", "B00006DXXT", "B0007KTBJO", "B003IB0FSU", "B0002W4SX6", "B0009UC7MK", "B000I2J6VE", "B00FWMVVF4", "B001BSBBSK", "B00GOC75YW", "B000SSQ7JW", "B0085Z6Z2O", "B001AXOFR0", "B00009VRF0", "B004MLEYUK", "B000BYRCF6", "0399142053", "B000EGDANO", "B0000AUXVS", "B0006T6MJ8", "B000HDR814", "B000C1VBAA", "B001992NZG", "B000AL733G", "B00KOW4AZ0", "B000UX6TKM", "B0012EM5EW", "B000M343AI", "B00308B170", "B00BI3XZA0", "B00CPTUN8S", "B002AL2TQK", "B00AQ5SPBU", "B00I099K4U", "B000KGGIL4", "B000BT96OG", "B001E6JC1W", "B00151QYYE", "B000EBGFQI", "B005DDN51A", "B001KGDNBG", "B0006Z2L4W", "B0007R4SWC", "B00GLT2SOA", "B004UOHNH0", "B00005JKF6", "B001GMH8WO", "B004CQZFL2", "B00AEBB8OC", "B00005JLIC", "B000B5XOUM", "B001LM64VK", "B000NJISIY", "B000BNTM46", "B00I458456", "B000EHQU0I", "B0009OUBPQ", "B0006BAWSI", "B0072BNJ0I", "B0000C2IVT", "B000291Q3O", "B0058J3S16", "B0012GVMIK", "B006TTC5Y0", "B00D2UMHB0", "B0002NY8R6", "B005F265IE", "B001TWT0CW", "B0002XNT08", "B0007WFXL2", "B005OASMLU", "B00JAD6BYW", "B00H8KC1N4", "B00AEFYNG8", "0425177319", "B002E58FTW", "B00FM4S7P4", "B00DJYK1XU", "B000291Q3Y", "B002VWNIAY", "B007I1TFK0", "B008MIYKB2", "B000HT3PGU"], "bought_together": ["B008KZX7W0", "B008L3653O"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B008KZX7W0", "B000TGJ8B2", "B008L3653O", "B008L3650M"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 74998}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 22.95, "brand": "Paramount", "asin": "B0002ERX8G", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Q8MV5PDEL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "I Love Lucy - The Complete Second Season"}

{"description": "Five discs gather the first eight movies in theFriday the 13thseries, plus a batch of behind-the-scenes featurettes. You can track the rise, fall, and endless resurrections of Jason Voorhees, from the original 1980 film to Jason's self-kidding trip to the Big Apple. Horror fans eat up packages such as this, but there's something odd about the deluxe treatment for a series that spotlighted atrocious acting, pitiful production values, and inane storytelling.You'll spot a few future \"name\" actors in various installments:  Kevin Bacon is morbidly dispatched in the first one. But in general, the dominant focus is how to kill horny teenagers, most of whom have gathered at Camp Crystal Lake in the misguided belief that the curse of the impossible-to-kill Jason has worn off. The first movie has a certain raw, crummy ability to shock,Part 2is a dismal retread, andPart 3actually features interesting use of 3-D, which doesn't translate to its flat DVD version. The fourth is boldly subtitledThe Final Chapter, and we all know where that went, but it does have Crispin Glover doing a funky dance.A New BeginningandJason Livescontinue Jason's bad mood, maybe because the hockey mask doesn't fit right. The seventh chapter,The New Blood, stakes Jason against a worthy opponent (Crystal Lake's answer to telekinetic Carrie), but the result is the same. Part 8's subtitle,Jason Takes Manhattan, is wittier than the movie itself, as Jason menaces an unlucky cruise ship of high-schoolers bound for New York--where Mr. J fits right in.Some of the films come with commentaries from directors or cast members, including heralded Jason performer Kane Hodder. Brief documentaries (ranging from five to 15 minutes) cover separate installments with amusing anecdotes, including interviews with Sean S. Cunningham, Tom Savini, and various actors. In another doc, actors speak of the fraternity of young actors who've been slaughtered by Jason over the years. A deleted-scenes section is skimpy and not very interesting, while the tricks of special-effects gore merit a film to themselves. It's a customer-savvy DVD box, even if the effect of watching a bunch of this stuff together is a little dispiriting.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001JFZ1UE", "B00006FDBT", "B00006FI0R", "B0033B5XCS", "B001NPD9LS", "B000RIWAVW", "B0000VCZMK", "B001DJLD0S", "B005CFC0N8", "B000Q66Q2O", "B000FA57UI", "B001L9EXNO", "B002ZG971U", "B000FA57US", "B00005LC4Q", "B001DJLD1W", "B004P7CM9Q", "B002XD0J80", "B002YICNE2", "B00LBFFR2Y", "B000I2J68M", "B000FWHW86", "B000VKL6Z2", "B005CFBZVG", "B00006LPHA", "B004AC6PMG", "B001B1UO6W", "B004P7CNUY", "B005CFBYW6", "B00DTPRZ24", "B000099T3M", "B004LWZW2O", "B000FS9FE4", "B000KJU1KK", "B00KTFJ50M", "B008874968", "B0000CEB6Y", "B0000AOX09", "B00L3OAS5Y", "B00KDU8HQQ", "B0091G7BTM", "B005CFBZQ6", "B0053TWVDC", "B000WC3864", "B00ETHN9L2", "B0052XU4BK", "B000WC389G", "B00018D42W", "B000HEWEGC", "B003HFUVQI", "B00079Z9WI", "B00L6AW1K0", "B003PIUINS", "B00AEFY37C", "B004EI2NP4", "B0056P6SOG", "B00CERJI5U", "B002AS45YM", "B0007Y7SUO", "B00AEFY31S", "B00AZ7V0W0", "B00BM4Q4H6", "B000HCO86I", "B00008WFU5", "B0053TWVIM", "B008R52L3Y", "B00009PY4G", "B00005K3NZ", "B008YAPR7E", "B005GT3X68", "B00K1L4NBU", "B00DTPRZ10", "B0029O0BJU", "B00006IUFV", "B000TJBN62", "B00008WFU4", "6305622760", "B000FC2GA0", "B000FSME9W", "B004EPZ08O", "B000Q66Q8I", "B008G4T7W4", "B003Q6D27S", "B005J9ZFQG", "B003PIUINI", "B0001Z37HM", "B00000G3R0", "B0001611DI", "B00D7AM6M0", "B003VJTGNE", "B00AQJ8MLY", "B000E1MXWS", "B002KH4KSY", "B002R3G912", "B000GETUDI", "B002YI9304", "B00005A8XX", "B0002C4JJ4"], "bought_together": ["B001JFZ1UE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AQJ8MLY", "B00AEFY2LO", "B00AEFY2WI", "B00AEFY37C"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 44580}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 110.0, "brand": "Paramount Home Video", "asin": "B0002JP572", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51gDGNA7AzL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Friday the 13th: From Crystal Lake to Manhattan Ultimate Collection (Part 1 / Part 2 / Part 3 / Part IV: The Final Chapter / Part V: A New Beginning / Part VI: Jason Lives / Part VII: The New Blood / Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan)"}
{"description": "Baadasssss!is actor-writer-director Mario Van Peebles's best film since 1991'sNew Jack City; more accurately, it is a mature and often dazzling work beyond previous expectations of Van Peebles' skills as a filmmaker. Certainly he was inspired by the autobiographical subject: The making of his father's 1971, independently producedSweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song, in which young Mario made his acting debut amidst a frantic, high-pressure operation that paid off when African American audiences embraced the film. Playing his ownhard-nosed dad, Melvin Van Peebles, the younger talent explores--honestly, but not ruthlessly--Melvin's rocky relationship with an ever-disappointed Mario (played byHoles' Khleo Thomas), but he also portrays the elder man as a stubborn idealist against a backdrop of Hollywood cynicism about black entertainment. The film is a whirlwind of action and innovative scenes recreating personal history but without the insistent discursiveness of memory. With Nia Long, Ossie Davis, and Saul Rubinek.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004LY8QCK", "B0000TWMT8", "B0002KPI1O", "B00007CVSO", "B0000696I2", "B000KG4BD6", "6305069751", "B002RSEN4M", "B002U4UZT0", "B00013F2OA", "B000BOH91I", "B000BT997K", "B000O7864Q", "B00K0NAM2I", "B000059TGC", "B0016LFG4M", "B000P0J0CE", "B0000VD0MY", "6305310963", "B002CWKU2M", "B0006QAIG4", "B00003L9CG", "1560256338", "B004RBC5U6", "B000053VB6", "B00075145S", "B000053VBA", "B00005RIIY", "B00062IYXM", "B000XJD34S", "B000053VBD", "B002CWKU18", "B003BV8I3Q", "B0002QDOP0", "B00005N7Z3", "B004YCKJGU", "B000BT997A", "B002CWKU3G", "B0006FYOX8", "B000BUE5FA", "B00HW3EI3I", "B001DW2BFQ", "B00005JD5J", "B00JPFTW1E", "B00AEFYE08", "0767821955", "B002WBYDLC", "B0006GAO40", "B000XECFXS", "B000TLOMPE", "B00005JKMQ", "B00HX0KIAM", "B001LLH8SO", "B00005YUNM", "B00GMV8IGO", "B001SGEUGK", "B000053VB8", "B000KX5NYK", "6305501068", "B0000549B2", "B001QMCJ5K", "B0001DCYJQ", "6305308799", "B001Q8MMC4", "B002CA68N4", "B003L8AZE4", "B00AZL310A", "B008SOSB0G", "B00CPKZKX0", "B002CWKU36", "B00007AJG2", "B00G4Q3KOC", "B00008CMRM", "B00005A1TJ", "B00441GZ1Y", "B00003CY51", "B00BYS0RQE", "B00004Z1FX", "B00D3LA7H4", "B00CDWQNZ4", "B000EOTVBQ", "0783230389", "B005R08HJY", "B007HO38TW", "B0001BKAP8", "B004UJN22U", "B00JPS6A3O", "B00315I6DE", "B0058KGHX6", "B000BITV9W", "B002DU39GW", "B0088RMEII", "B002CWKU2C", "B000CCBCLW", "B002TVQ4D0", "B000051YMS", "B00D3XM892", "B00G4Q3NDA", "B000031EGU", "B00CFK5I8M"], "bought_together": ["B004LY8QCK", "B0000TWMT8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004LY8QCK", "B0000696I2", "B0016LFG4M", "B000KG4BD6"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 78974}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.47, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B0002JZT50", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/519JT7H4TQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Baadasssss!

{"description": "MixThe Great Racewith the slapstick humor ofRoad Runnercartoons and the wildly inventive minds of Hanna-Barbera, and you've got the 1968 animated seriesWacky Races. You remember the lineup: the Slag brothers in the Boulder-Mobile; the Gruesome Twosome in the Creepy Coupe, with a dragon in its belfry; Prof. Pat Pending (ha ha) in the Convert-a-Car; Red Max in the Crimson Haybailer biplane; Sergeant Blast and Private Meekly in the tank-like Army Surplus Special; the Ant Hill Mob in the Bullitt-Proof Bomb; Lazy Luke and Blubber Bear in the Arkansas Chugga-Bug; Rufus Ruffcut and Sawtooth the beaver in the Buzz Wagon; the Belle of the Brickyard, Penelope Pitstop, in the Compact Pussycat; Peter Perfect in the Turbo Terrific; and our hissable villains, Dick Dastardly and his snickering muttering dog, Muttley (\"Sassa frassin'...\") in the Mean Machine.  In each 11-minute episode, the physics-defying cars compete in different areas of the country (\"See-Saw to Arkansas,\" \"Rhode Island Road Race,\" \"The Carlsbad or Bust Bash\"), so evenly matched that any car has a chance to win despite the evil schemes of Dastardly and Muttley, who always seem to come to a Wile E. Coyote-type end (writer Mike Maltese worked on both series). There's never really a plot, but just a string of situations and gags before someone finally crosses the finish line to earn the checkered flag.The DVD set contains all 34 episodes of the series, looking reasonably good.  Four members of the original creative team appear on a commentary track on four different episodes, and their discussion is less interesting for what they have to say aboutWacky Races(\"What was that car again?\") than for their memories of working for Hanna-Barbera (\"we did things off the top of the head\").  There's also pop-up factoids on two episodes, a 20-minute recap of the series' history, and a look at the two spinoff series,Dastardly and Muttley in Their Flying MachinesandThe Perils of Penelope Pitstop.  That a relatively short-lived series could inspire two spinoffs, toys, comic books, a CD-ROM game, and other souvenirs is a testament to its ability to capture the Saturday-morning imagination and create a lot of fond memories.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0007QS31A", "B0007QS31K", "B000FI9OEU", "B000FI9OEK", "B0002ZMHW2", "B002T9H2MY", "B003VADST6", "B000AOEMUA", "B000AOEMU0", "B000RPD0DM", "B00E44EZHC", "B001QU880M", "B004K5RN2O", "B000ZBEOHY", "B000OY9V7K", "B000OY9V7A", "B007Q49X4C", "B000ZBEOHO", "B002GNOLXQ", "B004P8R9S4", "B004ZRGSDM", "B00553KAK2", "B001RXDM22", "B002GNOLY0", "B001QU880W", "B0029WGIDK", "B0001MZ7IC", "B000MTPA5Y", "B00E1QLEJA", "B004M64QSK", "B0049IHWVY", "B00080ZFZC", "B00466X70Y", "B005SQRYG4", "B000TSTEMS", "B0001MZ7J6", "B007RKFXWQ", "B00961EO24", "B00B4ZN4D0", "B00125WAY6", "B00480OCWA", "B0013D8LPY", "B006JN86Z8", "B00BTHR0VK", "B00480OCWU", "B000P6R9IA", "B00LT1JHLW", "B000GG4XWE", "B000NDI3Q2", "B004VW4VAI", "B008N8A3JE", "B00961ENYI", "B000UAE7PE", "B005EXA87S", "B00BH418RW", "B000P6R9O4", "B000E1JOZ2", "B009H3LNF2", "B000E1JOYS", "B00652FG7O", "B00465I17Y", "B000CEXFZQ", "B00FNR9ZN8", "B0010YO0IS", "B00CGCKEYM", "B000PC1PAW", "B00DY9528Y", "B006WDWBK6", "B009P3J6BM", "B003Q7B7HO", "B0037XPPAW", "B005FQ1ONG", "B00KBES386", "B00553K9R6", "B009P3J5XG", "B0014VPFHW", "B0011XFOIS", "B001B23ED6", "B00465I1BA", "B002S3Y1LQ", "B0007939Q6", "B0001CNQUS", "B009P3J630", "B0007XFZMS", "B00555ZT7Y", "B00HMOW9YM", "B00F3L8OQS", "B002DH20Q0", "B004SD6X7E", "B008BSM18M", "B002H047OG", "B000ZOXDK0", "B005LOBWA2", "B0042I6528", "B003DU50U4", "B001O2UTTK", "B003CS28UC", "B005BYBZQ8", "B005BUA1CQ", "B0002ABU5C"], "bought_together": ["B0007QS31A", "B000FI9OEU"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002T9H2MY", "B003VADST6", "B00466X70Y", "B00553KAK2"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 33272}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 16.46, "brand": "Warner Brothers", "asin": "B0002MFGDW", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61%2BbBCPhUHL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Wacky Races - The Complete Series"}

{"description": "The vampiric Stephen King tale returns to the small screen, 25 years after the first made-for-TVSalem's Lot, a Tobe Hooper-directed ratings hit. This time it's Rob Lowe as a successful writer who returns to his haunted hometown. As a kid, something awful happened to him in the spooky mansion on the hill; now that he's back, the mansion is once again buzzing with evil portents. The physical production (shot in Australia) is convincing, and it's fun to see old pros such as Donald Sutherland, Rutger Hauer, and James Cromwell cutting up in juicy roles. The storytelling, however, feels oddly disjointed, as though King's sprawl had been arbitrarily hacked away rather than adapted (a few big moments are bewilderingly left offscreen). The approach misses the basic assets of a vampire story:  the disbelief, the lore, the sex appeal. Instead, it feels like a random collection of bits for short attention spans.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B003L2M584", "0790742829", "B00IYJRIKO", "B006J8NPAE", "B000G1R39E", "B000077VRT", "B00000F3SB", "B000GYI340", "1573625779", "B0000C2IQQ", "B00BW4S8AC", "B000063US5", "B0007WFXNA", "0792841328", "6305645574", "6305120021", "B00005UQ9V", "B000053UIF", "B00006FDCD", "B000068IES", "B00AEBB91E", "B00AEBB91O", "B0007NFMB2", "B0033HKCV4", "B000U1ZV6W", "B00BW4S87U", "0767821599", "B00L8QOZK6", "B00009OWI3", "B00BTYPW7C", "B00LNBQ8SI", "B00AEFXR8I", "1573626910", "B002NZK5SM", "B0001FVDQ4", "B0002A2VK0", "B0010X73ZG", "B000FDFWYG", "B005CFBZVG", "B00BW4S89S", "B00005O439", "B000TJ6PBK", "B0002O7XW2", "B002VWNIDG", "0792846443", "B00005JOJE", "B00DII0MGI", "B00IKM5LXG", "0307743675", "6304936397", "B00005LQ0Q", "B00L4K3MLE", "B000GBEWRU", "B004SEUJL4", "B0053TWV46", "B00KUS5YGC", "B00AEFYV9W", "B00A1AU72A", "B008QE9Z8A", "B00K2CHWYI", "6302814731", "078062856X", "B00030AZCK", "B000H4JH7Q", "B00006FDCU", "B0053TWVDC", "B00IJS2OXG", "B00D49YFAA", "6304604572", "B0052XU4BK", "B00009QG7O", "B00KYCA4QY", "B001CFEBW0", "6305258287", "B00023P4TM", "B00GNAO70K", "B00BEIYMAG", "B00005K3NR", "B0013LL2YS", "B005CFBZWK", "B00003CXCF", "B0051CSIKQ", "B0000AOX09", "0385182449", "1613470541", "B007XF0W3K", "B00009PY32", "6305106959", "B00FXOO1VC", "B000RZIGUE", "B00004TS0G", "B0017IVHHO", "1476754454", "B000069I05", "630523650X", "B003R0MEYA", "B003EYVXYG", "B0002234LS", "B000AA4JNO"], "bought_together": ["0790742829"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00IYJRIKO", "0790742829", "B00BW4S8AC", "B008QE9Z8A"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 50637}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.35, "brand": "Turner Home Ent", "asin": "B0002OXVG4", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51R2b7emk0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Salem's Lot - The Miniseries"}

{"description": "When a movie can blend passionate social concern with good old-fashioned suspense, it must be doing something right.Maria Full of Gracescores high on both counts. Maria is a Colombian teenager who, for a large paycheck, agrees to be a mule for drug-runners:  she has to swallow dozens of thumb-sized capsules of heroin and smuggle them into New York. This debilitating process is painstakingly described, and of course not everything goes as planned when Maria and her fellow mules land in America. Director Joshua Marston is working on a low budget, which explains the film's narrow, single-minded focus--but this may be a strength, not a weakness. The trump card is the lead performance of Catalina Sandrino Moreno, who won awards at the Seattle and Newport Film Festivals.

{"description": "Since its 1994 debut, Disney's animated seriesGargoyleshas attracted a sophisticated viewership for its unusually thoughtful storyline, mature characters, literary allusions (Arthurian lore, Shakespeare), and parade of celebrity voiceovers. Part Gothic fantasy and part contemporary urban drama,Gargoylesbegins with a brutal, 10th-century battle over a Scottish castle, which is guarded at night by winged gargoyles who become flesh in the dark (but who return to stone by day). Under the leadership of Goliath (Keith David), the gargoyles ward off an attack by Vikings, yet are met with disdain by those they protect, including a princess and her advisors. Such is the gargoyles' lot until they are betrayed by a friend and turned to stone for a thousand years. Rescued by a billionaire named Xanatos (Jonathan Frakes)--who breaks the spell by purchasing the castle and relocating it atop his Manhattan skyscraper--Goliath and his friends slowly adapt to the modern world and figure out whom they can trust. In a moving season finale, they adopt New York City as the home they vow to protect. With a certain urgency in every episode, tangled relationships between Goliath and his several allies and enemies (as well as characters who belong somewhere between), and a vocal cast full ofStar Trektypes (Michael Dorn, Nichelle Nichols, Marina Sirtis, among others),Gargoyleshas great appeal to thinking viewers of any age. Special features include the original show pitch by series creator Greg Weisman.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000ATQYVA", "B00198X0YA", "B000FS9MUQ", "B000Q6775E", "B000FS9MVA", "B00AQ590IC", "B000AXWGRM", "B000V1Y44Q", "B0042I6528", "B000HWZ4RA", "B000AXWGRC", "B000HWZ4R0", "B00DQFMHPC", "B00316DA9I", "B004H0M2ZU", "B001QIVEVE", "B00LQEUCT8", "B000V1Y450", "B004IB04OE", "B00I099JZK", "B00LBHOCHS", "1593621671", "B0007US7CQ", "B000CDGVNA", "B001OD8E2I", "B001QIVEVO", "B00LNBQ8UG", "B00AX0LKXS", "B000Q66PX4", "B000BQ7J9I", "B001JRYH1Q", "B00L9SXSCE", "B000G1R39Y", "B00DOZNH58", "B002DYKPF6", "B0007NFMCG", "B0001FVDG4", "6303315739", "B001BN25VW", "B00COSX8DM", "B000CSTK42", "B00IGVJH0E", "B0055UA1KO", "1593620969", "B000G26YAW", "B003L7DK88", "B000LE1798", "B0080730CK", "B006WDWBK6", "B006WNSHUY", "B00F8PTBZC", "B000LXHFNG", "630016411X", "B0007NY3A8", "B000HWZ4DO", "B00AQ590KU", "B00023E88U", "B00KTFJ79Q", "B0066E6T8G", "B0007VY40E", "B0007XG43W", "B000CSTK3S", "B008XRE81E", "B00HEUXKYW", "B002ZXZJ1A", "B00KHWSD1O", "B007NU541K", "B00466X70Y", "B0002MFGDW", "B00LG6XHDY", "B00FMGPVCO", "B000FA57H6", "B000CDGVNK", "B000M2E3FO", "B000ZBEOHY", "B000HWZ4DY", "B00023E894", "B004Q7BF5M", "B006WNSHZO", "B0052MXJ3Q", "B000GYI336", "B003F3NE4S", "B00IXL0ZYE", "B007J3ISIM", "B0002NY8XA", "B002DYKPFQ", "B001R1HEMI", "1781168954", "B00J8LXD56", "B00AMDA2QC", "B004S8UTII", "B006PA0WF2", "B000OY9V7A", "B00IJ4SFA6", "B000M2E33G", "B00G69QGPW", "B001A4VH3O", "B008XJM6H0", "B00HRUQAKU"], "bought_together": ["B000ATQYVA", "B00198X0YA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000FS9MUQ", "B00198X0YA", "B000ATQYVA", "B000AXWGRC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 5329}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 13.12, "brand": "DISNEY", "asin": "B0002W4SY0", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51nRvbXoWhL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Gargoyles: Season 1"}
{"description": "Startling and powerful,Control Roomis a documentary about the Arab television network Al-Jazeera's coverage of the U.S.-led Iraqi war, and conflicts that arose in managed perceptions of truth between that news media outlet and the American military. Egyptian-American filmmaker Jehane Noujaim (Startup.com) catches the frantic action at Al-Jazeera headquarters as President Bush stipulates his 48-hour, get-out-of-town warning to Saddam Hussein and sons, soon followed by the network's shocking footage of Iraqi civilians terrorized and killed by invading U.S. troops. Al-Jazeera's determination to show images and report details outside the Pentagon's carefully controlled information flow draws the wrath of American officials, who accuse it of being an al-Qaida propagandist. (The killing of an Al-Jazeera reporter in what appears to be a deliberately targeted air strike is horrifying.) Most fascinating is the wayControl Roomallows well-meaning, Western-educated, pro-democratic Arabs an opportunity to express views on Iraq as they see it--in an international context, and in a way most Americans never hear about.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001MFNB5I", "B001KP2J2G", "B0002HDXTQ", "B0001L3LUE", "B000NIVJH2", "B000LP5CX4", "B0001907AI", "B000YMDIZS", "B006ML50QK", "B00DPUB5LK", "B000YIGND6", "B000FWHW7C", "B001BEK8FQ", "B001MVWFAO", "B005D0RD98", "B001WAKOW6", "B000A2XCBC", "B00008DDVV", "B0060ZJ7DA", "B0030Y11XS", "B000CEXEWA", "B00AZMFM3I", "B000O76ZOY", "B000WP07F6", "B00094ARN2", "B000E0OE44", "B00H9KKGTO", "B001GLX6UI", "B001KVZ6AM", "B006DHATE6", "B000E1NXJ0", "B0059XTTW8", "B00GYG8BKK", "B000059TFO", "1451613520", "B00005JN0W", "B00074DXFS"], "bought_together": ["B001MFNB5I"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00701QYIE", "0802117899", "0813341493", "B005D0RD98"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 43437}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.63, "brand": "LION&#39;S GATE ENTERTAINMENT", "asin": "B0002X8U4I", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Q2S5V4J2L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Control Room"}
{"description": "The early-'90sBatmanseries was probably the best animated superhero show ever, mixing stylish animation with a dark tone appropriate for the Dark Knight.  The second volume, comprising four discs of 28 episodes and vastly preferable to the many single-disc releases, features familiar characters the Joker, Catwoman, the Penguin, Two-Face, Poison Ivy, as well as the first appearances of the Riddler, and Ra's Al Ghul and Talia.  The episodes are highlighted by the Emmy-winning two-parter \"Robin's Reckoning,\" which recounts the origin of the Boy Wonder and his chance for revenge years later.  In \"Perchance to Dream,\" Bruce Wayne finds his parents alive and another Batman patrolling Gotham City, the two-part \"Something\" pits Batman against Miyazaki-styled robots, and Batman revisits the samurai training of his past in \"Night of the Ninja\" and \"Day of the Samurai.\" Give the series credit for not talking down to kids--Japanese characters spoke in Japanese with English subtitles, and one episode, \"Almost Got 'Im,\" was styled after a '50s black-and-white variety show.  It employed smart humor and characterization even to the point where it could let villains carry an episode. Certain stories were based on comic books, and the series involved comics veterans such as Denny O'Neil and Len Wein.  Also camp-master Adam West appears as the voice of the Grey Ghost.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0007XG43W", "B000B7QCHC", "B00023E894", "B000YDBP84", "B002LWJ510", "B000A9QKLE", "B000A9QKL4", "B000F4RH8E", "B000B7QCGS", "B0002ZMHX6", "B000GYI336", "B000LE1798", "B000CSTK42", "B00LT1JHLW", "B000A9QKLO", "B003XMZVHY", "B000F4RH8O", "B000LE17A2", "B000CEXFZ6", "B000CSTK3S", "B0009UZG28", "B000UPMZ1M", "B000M2E32W", "B00005Y71G", "B003L7DK88", "B000GYI33Q", "B000FZETS4", "B0016OM3WC", "B001QIVEVO", "B001QIVEVE", "B005SH63HO", "B004L9GM3A", "B001A5ES9I", "B00005Y71J", "B002DYKPF6", "B00DP9MDE4", "B001614E68", "B002DYKPFQ", "B0036EH3XY", "B003ITZBVS", "B005SH6482", "B00GJ6HQDI", "B000OPODNG", "B005HN69G4", "B002FGUHBE", "B00GZ0ML4C", "B003UN2ICM", "1401207529", "B005CSYQ2S", "B003ITZBVI", "B002YOKVUY", "B004XKVRBE", "B008RV5K5E", "B000PFSYO4", "B00CPEK3NI", "B009OAWMK8", "B00GD9GNEY", "1401216676", "B000ATQYVA", "B00BTJV9RO", "B00IGVJH0E", "1401232590", "B0089TQ70Q", "B0031L5CJE", "B00A2LOAKI", "1401232744", "B0007XFZMS", "B00HFWETQW", "B00HMOW9YM", "1401223176", "1401244025", "B006PA0WF2", "B000A59PLU", "B00GZ0ML2Y", "B003F3NE4S", "B0039208QM", "B002A5EBLW", "B0018TNMCA", "B00CENSU1W", "B000PE0G0A", "B000G1R39Y", "B0002W4SY0", "1401211534", "1563893428", "B001LK8SQ6", "B002K0WBDM", "B001PU8N26", "0785124985", "B00DP9RYDY", "B0027FG29Y", "B000EHSVG4", "1401235425", "B003XTUAHS", "B001614FX0", "B007KW5MOU", "1401233791", "B00HRUQAKU", "B00J8LXD60", "B004ZKKL14", "B0007NFMCG"], "bought_together": ["B0007XG43W", "B000B7QCHC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00023E894", "B0007XG43W", "B000A9QKLE", "B001QIVEVE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 8662}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 32.61, "brand": "Warner Brothers", "asin": "B0002ZMHWM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Kgt4kAXZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Batman: The Animated Series, Volume Two (DC Comics Classic Collection)"}

There she meets a number of mutated Borg who can exist in this world in their pre-assimilation state and who also present an idea for destroying the collective from within.

{"description": "Sex and the Cityis based on Candace Bushnell's provocative bestselling book. Sarah Jessica Parker stars as Carrie Bradshaw, a self-described \"sexual anthropologist,\" who writes \"Sex and the City,\" a newspaper column that chronicles the state of sexual affairs of Manhattanites in this \"age of un-innocence.\" Her \"posse,\" including nice girl Charlotte (Kristin Davis), hard-edged Miranda (Cynthia Nixon), and party girl Samantha (Kim Cattrall)--not to mention her own tumultuous love life--gives Carrie plenty of column fodder. Over the course of the first season's 12 episodes, the most prominent dramatic arc concerns Carrie, who goes from turning the tables on \"toxic bachelors\" by having \"sex like a man\" to wanting to join the ranks of \"the monogamists\" with the elusive Mr. Big (Chris Noth). Meanwhile, Miranda, Cynthia, and Samantha have their own dating woes.The second season builds on the foundation of the first season with plot arcs that are both hilarious and heartfelt, taking the show from breakout hit to true pop-culture phenomenon. Relationship epiphanies coexist happily alongside farcical plots and zingy one-liners, resulting in emotionally satisfying episodes that feature the sharp kind of character-defining dialogue that seems to have disappeared from the rest of TV long ago. When last we left the NYC gals, Carrie had just broken up with a commitment-phobic Mr. Big (Chris Noth), but fans of Noth's seductive-yet-distant rake didn't have to wait long until he was back in the picture, as he and Carrie tried to make another go of it. Their relationship evolution, from reunion to second breakup, provides the core of the second season. Among other adventures, Charlotte puzzles over whether one of her beaus was \"gay-straight\" or \"straight-gay\"; Miranda tries to date a guy who insists on having sex only in places where they might get caught; and Samantha copes with dates who range from, um, not big enough tofartoo big--with numerous stops in between.The third season was the charm, as the series earned its first Emmy for Outstanding Comedy Series to go along with its Golden Globes for Best Comedy Series and Best Actress (Parker). One of this season's two principal story arcs concerned hapless-in-love Charlotte and her pursuit of a husband; enter (if only...) Kyle McLachlan as the unfortunately impotent Trey. Meanwhile, Carrie has a brief but memorable fling with a politician who's golden, but not in the way she anticipated. She then sabotages her too-good-to-be-true relationship with furniture designer Aidan (John Corbett) by having an affair with Mr. Big (Chris Noth), who himself has gotten married. LikeI Love Lucy, the series benefited from a brief change of scenery with a three-episode jaunt to Los Angeles, where Carrie and company encountered, among others, Matthew McConaughey, Vince Vaughn, Hugh Hefner, and Sarah Michelle Gellar.The fourth season is just as smart and sexy as ever, mixing caustic adult wit and sharply observed situation comedy on the mean streets of Manhattan, though this time the quartet of singleton city girls must endure even tougher combat in the unending war of love, sex, and shopping. Carrie finally seems to have found her ideal life partner when she is reunited with handsome craftsman Aidan. But can their relationship survive trial by cohabitation? Meanwhile Charlotte seems to have both her dream Park Avenue apartment and a solution to her marital problems with Trey. But when the subject of babies comes up, everything starts to unravel for her, too. It's not just Charlotte who has baby issues either: after what seems like an eternity of enforced sexual abstinence Miranda is horrified to discover she's pregnant. And as for the sultry Samantha, she's on a quest for monogamy, first with an exotic lesbian artist, then with a philandering businessman, with whom to her utter dismay she just might have fallen in love.It was a short but sweet fifth season, as HBO's resident comediennes found themselves affected by forces beyond their control--the pregnancies of both Sarah Jessica Parker and Cynthia Nixon. A truncated shooting schedule to accommodate the actresses forced this season to be reduced to a mere eight episodes, but they and creators forged ahead, creating a handful of episodes that if short in content were long on emotion and laughs. Carrie and Miranda wrestled with their solitary lifestyles, albeit with new attachments--Miranda had new baby Brady and single motherhood, while Carrie found herself in the world of publishing as the author of a real-life book of her columns. Charlotte wondered if she'd ever find another man, while Samantha finally got rid of the one that had been vexing her far too much. If the season as a whole felt less than the sum of its parts, those parts were some of the best comedy in the show's history. The season's climactic episode, \"I Love a Charade,\" was one of the series' best episodes ever, equally touching and funny, and grounded the show in an emotional maturity that announced that after all their wild travails, these women had truly grown up.After a long wait--like the entire fifth season--Carrie is dating again. The sixth season starts with Carrie and her sparkly new potential, Berger (Ron Livingston), trying to leave past relationships and hit it off, with mixed results. Meanwhile Carrie's friends seem to be settling down, relatively speaking. Miranda decides that her affair with TiVo cannot compete when Mr. Perfect (Blair Underwood, at his most charming) moves into her building. Charlotte's feelings for her \"opposites attract\" boyfriend (Evan Handler) deepen, but they still have a few things to iron out. Most surprising is Samantha's hot relationship with waiter-actor-stud Smith Jerrod (Jason Lewis) taking on something resembling love, despite Samantha's best intentions. Before the sixth season started in the summer of 2003, a bombshell hit: it was announced that this would be the finale. But it would be a long season, and these 12 episodes plant the seeds for the final 8 airing the following winter. These dozen episodes illustrate the maturity of the show: there's not a bad one in the bunch, and the show is still flat-out funny. The comedy blends serious points of how we perceive singles, couples, and parents (and the gifts we lavish on the latter two). Carrie's method of celebrating her singlehood is just another gem in this treasure of a series.With the last eight episodes of the sixth season, HBO's grand sitcom concluded, leaving untold numbers of women--and many men--feeling deprived. The six-year series certainly did not outlast its welcome; the final season is some of the best TV had to offer in 2004. In many ways, the eight episodes served as a single finale, with all four characters approaching a kind of destiny and happiness, the theme of this last half-season (which aired weeks after the first half). Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) continues her romance with Russian artist (Mikhail Baryshnikov), a flippantly arrogant man who's been around the block, but able to supply Carrie's needed desire for magic. Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) has settled down with Steve (David Eigenberg), but there is more that will change with her, including her address. Charlotte (Kristin Davis) continues to make baby plans now that the husband slot is filled quite nicely (Evan Handler). Going down the final stretch--and Samantha's (Kim Cattrall) cancer--gives the series a more serious tone, but there's always a jab to tickle the funny bone: Miranda's awkwardness with happiness, Charlotte's latest passion, Carrie typing someplace new, and Samantha getting into Paris Hilton territory. Like any series winding down, there is a wedding, a baby, old faces popping up, and some star-ladened new ones. In the final two-part episode, \"An American in Paris,\" Carrie faces her romantic destiny, but also solidifies herself as a fashion icon, an Audrey Hepburn for 21st-century television. In the penultimate episode, she asks her friends an emotional question: \"What if I never met you?\" Certainly fans can ask of themselves the same question and reminisce how much better TV became since they first tuned in these four women of the City.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B006WZIB1C", "B001DDBCUA", "B002ZG98Z0", "B00AIQAS76", "B001DDBCV4", "B002ZG98ZA", "B00B5AAW52", "B002YBUX0K", "0446617687", "B003Z8ZCG6", "B00B1LN8WY", "B004EPZ070", "B0046XG48O", "0316284955", "B00004RFCM", "B00FPUN57K"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003Z8ZCG6", "B00004RFCM", "B00382S9UA", "B00382S9SM"]}, "price": 129.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 231120}, "asin": "B000646MNE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51QPTYCPH6L._SX300_.jpg", "title": "Sex and the City - The Complete Series: Seasons 1-6"}

{"description": "Lives were upended--and some co-opted--in the fifth and final season ofAngel, as the denizens of Angel Investigations found themselves taking on one of their scariest endeavors ever: corporate life. After making a literal deal with the devil (or something distinctly devil-like), Angel (David Boreanaz) moved his team from their crumbling hotel to the high-rise digs of law-firm-from-hell Wolfram & Hart, his reasoning being they could better fight the forces of evil from the inside, and with more resources to boot. Clever maneuvering or easy rationalization? Not a few members of Angel's team accused him of selling out (as did a number of viewers), but as with most of the show's previous four seasons,Angelsomehow took a dubious premise and mined it for gold. And with one core cast member gone (Charisma Carpenter, whose Cordelia was immersed in a deep coma), it seemed as if the show, from within and without, would suddenly fall apart--that is, until Angel's longtime nemesis Spike (James Marsters) showed up, fresh from his sacrificial roasting at the series finale ofBuffy the Vampire Slayer. Let the vampire games begin!WithBuffyoff the air, fans flocked toAngel's last season to get their fix of Joss Whedon's \"Buffyverse\" in any form they could, and the addition of Spike was a shrewd one, albeit not enough to keep the show from getting canceled. And for the first half of the season, the creative forces behind the show seemed to be toying ruthlessly with the audience. Spike was around, but not entirely corporeal; Angel himself became sullen and withdrawn; and most horrifically, sweetheart scientist Fred (Amy Acker) and former watcher Wesley (Alexis Denisof) underwent traumas that would test even the most devoted viewer. However, just when you'd be about to throw in the towel, things started changing for the better--Spike became a permanent fixture (both in the flesh and on the show), Angel's secret motives were revealed, and the introduction of demon warrior Illyria, who proved to be the show's answer toBuffy's sardonic demon-made-human Anya, was a welcome breath of fresh air.  Creatively,Angelalso came up with some of its best episodes, including \"Smile Time\" (where Angel is turned into a puppet &#x96; really!) and \"You're Welcome\" (the show's 100th episode, which marked the bittersweet return of Carpenter's Cordelia). The ending of the series was deliberately ambiguous, and not everyone made it through alive, but in going out kicking, it was a proper sendoff for a show that always fought the good fight.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000I0QLRS", "B000I0QLRI", "B000I0QLR8", "B000I0QLQY", "B000EHSVM8", "B000EHSVN2", "B000EHSVMS", "B000EHSVLY", "B000EHSVLE", "B000EHSVL4", "B000EHSVKK", "B0006IUE16", "B0009W5J4Q", "B007H9CNOI", "B000B5XOW0", "B000CCBCGM", "B0046XG48O", "B00AMDA2QC", "B00006J3WH", "B001L1S1OY", "B000ERVJM2", "B002JVWR4A", "B001992NWO", "B009LDD4V4", "B00HUPC5X8", "B000JLTRIG", "1593078226", "B000X5SPBI", "B000GG4Y6O", "B0000AQS0F", "B000RO6JYK", "B0024FAR66", "B002JVWR4U", "B000OIOPHC", "B000HT3P60", "B000BOH990", "B00AMDA2P8", "B00HR736AA", "B002JVWRAO", "B0053O89IS", "B00133QNS6", "B00JF5GAZA", "B009LDCXNY", "B000BOH98G", "B002N5N5MK", "B001FB4W0C", "B000BOH986", "B000FIMG68", "B0009JE6FC", "B006LG74Q0", "B00008KA59", "B000A5045Q", "B003L77G8I", "B0016QNSGA", "B002CLKP00", "B004YM6JI2", "B001MVWRMU", "1595826106", "B001QE99AQ", "B0024FAD9C", "B000CNE0SS", "B000FP2OPY", "B00008KA57", "B001B7CNZ6", "B0085KGG96", "B009LDD5XQ", "159307963X", "B000HD1482", "B003BV8I7C", "B000F8O2PG", "B00006FD9N", "B00008KGT0", "B003L77GGK", "B000EMG922", "6302020190", "B00020H9NO", "B000OCY7TY", "B000B8I9ZO", "B000LE1798", "B0053O8A46", "B0000959N0", "B00133QNSG", "B000EXDS3E", "B000CNE0T2", "B0009ZE9Y4", "1569717516", "B000R7GKQE", "B00BBXSPES", "B003L77G6U", "B0011FLGZQ", "B000BUE5D2", "B00HVJKAMG", "B00HQQ7KCC", "B002BWP2BW", "B001MVWRMK", "B004LWZW42", "B00001R3O1", "B00IWTVDUW", "B0002Y0QV2", "B001MVWRN4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000I0QLR8", "B000I0QLRS", "B000I0QLQY", "B000I0QLRI"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 91567}, "asin": "B0006GAO54", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51MHX7XV3QL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Angel - Season Five"}

{"description": "Jarod (Michael T. Weiss) is a Pretender. As a five-year-old in 1963, he was taken from his home and \"adopted\" by The Centre, a mysterious Delaware-based think tank. Why Jarod? His superior intellect--Jarod can \"pretend\" to be anything he wants: doctor, lawyer, engineer, astronaut and, as he quips in episode five (\"The Paper Clock\"), \"I'm working on Indian chief.\"Thirty years later, once he realized his efforts were not being used for good, Jarod escaped from the Centre. Psychiatrist and surrogate father Sydney (Carniv&#xE0;le's velvet-voiced Patrick Bauchau) and sociopathic sidekick and Emma Peel lookalike Miss Parker (ER's Andrea Parker) have been trying to track him down ever since. They&#x92;re assisted by the technically proficient, if socially inept Broots (Napoleon Dynamite's Jon Gries). Each and every time, Jarod eludes their grasp, but not before helping some stranger who's been dealt an injustice (just as he once was). Along the way, he hopes to figure out who he is and where he came from.Each of these 21 episodes moves deftly from Jarod's lonely past to his more satisfying, if precarious present (the human \"science project\" was constantly videotaped as a boy, hence the abundance of footage from his childhood). It's a worthy successor to paranoid thrillers likeThe Fugitiveand the unjustly obscureNowhere Man(fromX-Filescreator Chris Carter), and the droll performance of Weiss (Jeffrey) adds a dose of levity to a concept usually painted with a darker palette.The Pretenderran on NBC for four seasons and was followed by two TV movies,The Pretender 2001andIsle of the Haunted.--Kathleen C.

{"description": "Series 6 is possibly the most eagerly awaited of theRed DwarfDVD sets, due to its acclaimed third episode, \"Gunmen of the Apocalypse,\" which earned the program an International Emmy Award in 1994. However, the five other episodes in the series have their own share of absurd laughs, and the two-disc set features enough supplemental features to keep even the most demandingRDfan happy. The crux of series 6 is that theRed Dwarfhas been stolen (no thanks to Lister, who can't remember where he left it), and the crew must recover it; their pursuit brings them in contact with brain-consuming aliens (\"Psirens,\" with guest star Jenny Agutter), a polymorph that turns Rimmer and Cat into their alternate identities from Series V (\"Emohawk--Polymorph II\"), the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse tricked out as gunslingers (\"Gunmen of the Apocalypse\"), an army of Rimmer clones (\"Rimmerworld\"), and finally, their own future selves, who turn out to be particularly awful (worse than the present-day ones, that is), and cause a cliffhanger ending that just might spell the end for the Red Dwarf crew.... In short, series 6 more than earns its popular status amongRed Dwarf's fanbase, thanks to its sharp writing (sadly, it would be the last series to feature scripts by co-creator Rob Grant) and energetic performances. And the double-disc set matches the quality of the programs with some terrific extras, including commentaries by the RD crew and fans (the latter on \"Gunmen of the Apocalypse\" only), and featurettes on composer Howard Goodall and series director Andy de Emmony; these are rounded out by the usual collections of \"smeg-ups\" (bloopers), deleted scenes, behind-the-scenes footage, and another episode of the \"Dave Hollins, Space Cadet\" radio sketch that inspired the show. And again, the most patient of viewers will find Easter eggs on the menus (happy hunting).--Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0006Z2L0G", "B000BVM1TQ", "B0000WN0ZU", "B000EU1Q4U", "B0000WN0ZA", "B00007AP32", "B0026P3HPW", "B00007AP31", "B009Z59778", "B009Z5BPYG", "B002FQJT0Y", "B00IO998U2", "B00CDEJRDC", "B00E688U9K", "B00C6ACWLC", "B000BHHVNQ", "B006LPHY6G", "B00GRZPRQO", "B004MA1JZY", "B00C6ACVD6", "B0002CX21K", "B00C6ACVWM", "B00242KD1S", "B00006LPCK", "B00C6ACUF0", "B001C71IGA", "0140174664", "B009RZ160W", "B0032JTUX4", "B000BOH990", "B003O97W2S", "B000CNE0SS", "B00AATGDXO", "B0001NBNFW", "B003L77GUG", "B00CENXWA6", "B000067FPC", "B001YYQA0K", "B004QZ6S4C", "0783228457", "B00443FN1A", "B00BLSJQQ4", "B00C6ACT3I", "B000KGGIRI", "B005PPMHWE", "B00114XLZK", "B00ANDR1HO", "B0053TWVLY", "B002EOVX9W", "B004SGWYW4", "B005PPMHO2", "B000GI3RZ6", "B00FAVRFXE", "B004GJYRGO", "B007CO5MVE", "B0002JP4GE", "B00004WG2D", "B0055SNHQG", "B004X60QWO", "B000CNE0TC", "B00FM4S5O2", "B00F3L8P26", "B001NOMOS8", "B005M2A4D4", "B000CNE0T2", "B0024FAD9C", "B004TJ1H3C"], "bought_together": ["B0006Z2L0G", "B000BVM1TQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0006Z2L0G", "B0000WN0ZA", "B009Z59778", "B000BVM1TQ"]}, "price": 11.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 103849}, "asin": "B0006Z2L0Q", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51wdI-rX9aL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Red Dwarf: Series VI"}
{"description": "The rugged world of long-haul trucking knits perfectly with classic film noir dynamics in this sizzling, underrated picture. Navy veteran Richard Conte returns home to California, only to plunge into a revenge scenario and a scheme to haul the season's first apples to the teeming San Francisco fruit market (a place seen as a nocturnal jungle for the survival of the fittest). Lee J. Cobb enjoys himself enormously as the chiseling boss at the Frisco market, Millard Mitchell is wry as Conte's angle-playing trucking partner, and Valentina Cortese adds a bright, sexy exoticism to the multi-layered duplicitous dame. Director Jules Dassin, in his last American-shot film before blacklisting, shows his expressive abilities with shadowy interiors and road-movie exteriors alike. The punchy screenplay by A.I. Bezzerides, whose trucking experiences also fueledThey Drive by Night, is a textbook case for the complexities of pulp--not apples, fiction.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0006Z2NE0", "B000M2E3GI", "B000MTEFOQ", "B00012L786", "B00005A8TX", "B004C2523M", "B0024FAG80", "B001CC7PM6", "B00AQ6J5YA", "B00007ELDG", "B00005AUK9", "B000B8384Q", "B00023P4GA", "B0024FAG8A", "B000EXDSBQ", "B0000CNY4M", "B009X919UE", "B000PKG6OE", "B0009X7682", "B005152C9G", "B00005AUKD", "B000087F79", "B00I9BU3M2", "B00ICWO1LC", "B000CNE088", "B0080JG2GE", "B00FPUN21O", "B00BGARG3C", "B000LN6UHI", "B000PKG7DE", "B0007ZEO8C", "B0007ZEO7S", "B000B83846", "B00023P4II", "B000FI9OCW", "B008BSM1CI", "B00E18QKJ2", "B000FKO3VW", "B00IGK6T9W", "B0016B6ZEC", "B00KIZYDCI", "B00GPPXNEE", "B00EL6A9CI", "B00005JKGX", "B000EXDSBG", "6305999872", "B00005Y70U", "B00GBT629C", "B001CW7ZSU", "B0010KHOSU", "B00023P4FQ", "B00HRISNPM", "B00004W229", "B00457ZNS8", "B0009X7678", "B001CC7PLW", "B003G9IT3C", "B00074DY0M", "B000CNE08I", "B001CW7ZSA", "B0024FAG6W", "B00DZP1C9K", "B008BSM1XC", "B000AQKUG8", "B00C3ALM02", "B000244F2S", "B009RWRIP2", "B001SMC9L2", "B000093NQZ", "B00004XPPK", "B0007PALVQ", "B00023P4G0", "B00AEBBA7W", "B00007ELD1", "B000FKO3VC", "B00HE011DE", "B00HVOFP12", "B002YNQEFG", "B00GBT62PQ", "B00005RDRL", "B00E21D9ME", "B00CVB6XF2", "B00K6J7IIW", "B00I9BU60Q", "B000KJTGFG", "B002YNQEF6", "B00F98FOFY", "B00BFWKE6C", "B00EL6A7XE", "B00004W19C", "B005152C78", "B00DO0MEOS", "B00553K8DQ", "B00DBE97S8", "B000PMFRW4", "B00C3ALKWM", "B006TTC5A4", "B00K6J7Q6G", "B001QFFBAM", "B0009X766O"], "bought_together": ["B0006Z2NE0", "B000MTEFOQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005A8TX", "B00012L786", "B0006Z2NE0", "B000M2E3GI"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 168011}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 26.52, "brand": "Image Entertainment", "asin": "B0006Z2NDQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514GB65DEKL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Thieves' Highway (The Criterion Collection)"}

{"description": "While 2003'sDaredevilwas a conventional superhero movie, the 2005 spinoff,Elektra, is more of awuxia-styled martial arts/fantasy flick. Elektra (Jennifer Garner) has returned to her life as a hired assassin, but she balks at an assignment to kill a single father (Goran Visnjic,ER) and his teenage daughter (Kirsten Prout). That makes her the target of the Hand, an organization of murderous ninjas, scheming corporate types, and a band of stylish supervillains seeking to eliminate Elektra and tip the balance of power in the ongoing battle of good vs. evil.As the star ofAlias, Garner has proven that she can kick butt with the best of them, and some of the visual effects are impressive, but the action sequences tend to be anticlimactic, and there's not much to the story. Fans will notice numerous references toFrank Miller's comic books, but there's very little resemblance to Miller's cold-blooded killer (Elektra with an agent? Elektra referring to herself as a \"soccer mom\"?).IsElektrabetter thanDaredevil? Not really, even with the distinct advantage of having all Garner and no Ben Affleck. That could be the spinoff's greatest disappointment: afterSpider-Man 2raised the bar for comic-book movies,Elektralowered it back toDaredevil's level.  Directed by Rob Bowman (theX-Filesmovie), and featuring Terence Stamp as the mysterious mentor Stick, Will Yun Lee (Die Another Day) as the chief villain, and NFL-player-turned-mixed-martial-arts-champion Bob Sapp as the immovable Stone.DVD featuresBen Affleck's much-rumored cameo is one of the deleted scenes on theElektraDVD.  It's a one-minute throwaway, and while he's supposedly appearing as Matt Murdock (who romanced Elektra inDaredevil), the barrage of celebrity gossip makes it impossible to see him as anything other than Jennifer Garner's real-life boyfriend.  There's also a making-of featurette, which is mostly promotional hype other than a few interesting effects shots; four editing featurettes; and Jennifer Garner's videotaped message to ComicCon.--David HoriuchiMore onElektraElektra: The Album(Soundtrack CD)Elektra: The Movie(Comic Adaptation)Frank Miller Comic BooksDaredevil(Director's Cut) (DVD)Jennifer Garner stars inAlias(DVD)More Superhero DVDs", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000959N0", "B000VI70QS", "B00005JNTU", "B0006L0LOS", "B000FGGE68", "B001QB9H1U", "B001CDR1FG", "B000OVLBF8", "B00AEFXCLU", "B0002IQMAM", "B005LAIGW8", "B001DHXT20", "B004EPZ07K", "B001F7MSFM", "B001GCUO1Q", "B0009A409S", "B008JFUS0U", "B002GSXKNI", "B00E5I2MEK", "B004LWZW42", "B0007V6ITE", "B000UR9T8C", "B001AK3S4Y", "B00K7IPFSM", "B00E5I2MCM", "078401132X", "B00E5I2M9K", "B00005JM5B", "B0090SI56Y", "B00005JKWJ", "B004LWZWFQ", "B0002KVUKM", "B000HCO83Q", "B003YOZNBU", "B000J10EQU", "B00003CXZ1", "B00E5I2M6I", "B000AYELVU", "B00005JMQW", "B008JFUO72", "B003Y5H5EW", "B000HEVZ9E", "B000AYELVA", "B000VI28Z6", "B00JL6L4UY", "B009MO57H6", "B00AEFYGBA", "B002ZG99B8", "B0083SBMBM", "B001CC7PKS", "B00005JKCH", "B0007WFX62", "B0006IIPIK", "6307397594", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B0009MDPYM", "B001OQCVI8", "B00JPS7HOA", "0780624890", "B00F4FFO8E", "B002GSXKN8", "B008JFUPFI", "B00IKM5LXG", "B00177Y9ZC", "B003YAR97K", "B002ZG98UA", "B002NXSRVG", "B000EQHXN2", "B001RHGRT8", "B00IZZDWKM", "B001GZ6QC4", "B004LWZWGA", "B0021L8V0M", "B000VR0570", "1558908846", "B001HN697M", "B00005JLYW", "B008JFURII", "B001MVWRNE", "B001FB55HQ", "B005LAII44", "B00A2H9OSK", "B001QTXM5Y", "B002ZG983M", "B00BTYMPUY", "B002U4UZSQ", "B001QB9H2E", "B002ZG99G8", "B005G4TJUC", "B0012RLX88", "B003Q6D2B4", "B00195FUDC", "B008Y1YK9Y", "B001OQCUZM", "B00HMVJB0K", "B002ZG98N2", "B00005JNJV", "B004SIP9Z6", "B000K7UBSO", "B00HEPDGKA"], "bought_together": ["B0002XVQNU", "B000VI70QS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005JLXE", "B0090SI56Y", "B00979KQAO", "B000VI28Z6"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 23534}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.99, "brand": "TCFHE", "asin": "B0007P0Y7C", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51R5W%2BoU9CL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Elektra (Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "Touched by an Angelswiftly amassed a devout following, drawn to the TV series' clear Christian values and the warm performances of Roma Downey (she of the creamy complexion and lush pre-Raphaelite hair) and Della Reese as Monica and Tess, two angels sent to help troubled human beings. The first season had the additional virtue of exploring the ordinary yet complex emotional problems of troubled marriages, rebellious teens, and coping with the death of a loved one, in stories that were (with a few exceptions) cleanly written and down-to-earth--though, of course, everything was resolved by divine intervention. The second season, regrettably, dives into melodrama: A pregnant woman is trapped in a bank vault after her husband tries to rob the bank; a lawyer meets up with an old girlfriend, not knowing that her wicked ambitions caused his best friend to commit suicide; a postal worker sends atheistic replies to children's letters to God--and it turns out that he's an Auschwitz survivor. Even episodes grappling with what could be compelling material, like a stripper who feels responsible for her daughter's birth defect, get pushed over the top when Tess saves the day by creating a hot air balloon out of thin air. Certainly, God can accomplish miracles, but the second season ofTouched by an Angelloses sight of his subtlety and mysterious ways. Nonetheless, fans will continue to take comfort in the show's message about divine love.Episodes feature a wide range of guest stars: Movie actors like Elliott Gould (M*A*S*H) and Stacy Keach (Fat City); old television hands like Hal Linden (Barney Miller) and Cindy Williams (Laverne & Shirley); non-actors like poet Maya Angelou and singer Natalie Cole; and such, well, lesser celebrities as Kathie Lee Gifford (Live with Regis and Kathie Lee.) John Dye joins the series in this season as Andrew, a handsome angel of death.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0002ERWVE", "B000BYRCGA", "B000HWZ4L6", "B000VDDE04", "B007ZR9H5K", "B000LV6W0A", "B008F283XG", "B00BUWD7NE", "B00E96AWY0", "B000VDDDZU", "B00B58FWGI", "B002L9N4ZG", "B00GOC75V0", "B00CKYHH5A", "B00ENFS0FK", "B000HWZ4JS", "B00JDCP0QA", "B002UPQ232", "B002UPQ1SI", "B002L9N500", "B000YA82GA", "B00650RWZA", "B003O5MNS0", "B004H91APO", "B00000DHR7", "B0006Q93BA", "B00KDK64DY", "B0002I838Q", "B000HWZ4IE", "B00650RWGO", "B004H91ATA", "B003XJABWM", "B000LV6VZ6", "B0028SVY20", "B000Z6GT4K", "B001E549KC", "B0083TUE7E", "B000E3L7FK", "B00ICWO144", "B00KD5HFJG", "B0001WNL2G", "B000VDDDZA", "B00HR2HTRQ", "B001E6JC26", "B0015I2S74", "B000ERVJKY", "B005MQ58LS", "B0001DMXEC", "B00016JE5U", "B0007TKHKC", "B004M9ZI0C", "B000F9T70A", "B001GMH8WO", "B00AMR5LZA", "B002LW9IM6", "B004MLEYUK", "B00HQLZCIQ", "B001CQONOK", "B000VDDDYG", "B000NOIX6G", "B00005JO3P", "B002ZTLVXY", "B002C6A6N6", "B000JLTRMC", "B0055CAIBO", "0310213975", "B00GLPYVT4", "B000LC4ZBC", "B004HJ0ZP0", "B007CF6S1Q", "B00ICWO0ZY", "B000NOIX84", "B003XJABZO", "B000CCBCCG", "B000C6NPHC", "B00AEBBACM", "B00JEZWRE4", "B00E8AVN9U", "B006CR2OWM", "B001JTRKHW", "B0030Y12A0", "B004D2GMVM", "B001MVWM7A", "B000GIXCFQ", "B000F7CMQI", "B008OR5X6M", "B0042RJWU6", "B00GOC74QG", "B00FRILRZC", "B000H7JCJQ", "B005LFQRTC", "B00002MZ53", "B000PHX5KU", "B001F7AQDS", "B00GM1X2RO", "B0000AQS5E", "B000BUE5DC", "B000SQFC0O", "B008WAM2DI", "B00005JO2V"], "bought_together": ["B0002ERWVE", "B000BYRCGA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0002ERWVE", "B00BUWD7NE", "B000BYRCGA", "B00GOC75V0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 20933}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 12.46, "brand": "Paramount", "asin": "B0007TKHFM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51TM2CQY0AL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Touched by an Angel: Season 2"}

Each disc offers \"Origins ofThe Outer Limits,\" a talking-heads interview with the show's creators, as well as featurettes on the making of the episodes compiled on each disc (theSex and Sci-FiandAliens Among Usdiscs offer slight variations on this format by offering a multi-part featurette and a documentary on a single episode, respectively).--Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000B5IP4W", "B00GT4NCBU", "B001A7GOCA", "B0002J4ZX2", "B0007CEXUY", "B0002CX1M0", "B0016MOWNM", "B003VJTGNE", "B001DXS4DI", "B00092ZLDK", "B006TBYC76", "B000068V9T", "B003BNO9GO", "B004E5BQDW", "B00068NVLQ", "B000QTCY7M", "B00IS6WQ2S", "B000068V9S", "B0045Z2W0C", "B0051GOB2G", "B00005JN8Q", "B000TJBNF8", "B001BGS17Q", "B003OW6JAG", "B00026L7OU", "B00I9BU2IC", "B00005JOJE", "B000FJH5M2", "B00DOZNI8Y", "B0007XG158", "B001CY5N00", "B004ZJ9VXY", "B001RHGRTS", "B000FOPPBA", "B000OPOAKW", "B00022FWEU", "B000HCO86I", "B000SULWKO", "B000H5U5EE", "B00GX7D5G0", "B00D9EJFZA", "B001CT05SA", "B00013D54Y", "B0007US7CQ", "B000ELL1QC", "B000GYI340", "B006MFQ4OS", "B005AMJ3B0", "B003Y8YAZQ", "B008DVJOQ4", "B002USF1UO", "B001FACH7S", "B00021R7CG", "B00AEFYXQI", "B009OE2NZI", "B006BZ8NSE", "B005GYXN2M", "B00E5G03I4", "B00A92MFQG", "B006P2TA44", "B003NKU9XM", "B002TVQ4GW", "B0085Z3BYE", "B00BTYPW7C", "B00F3L8P26", "B0007X7044", "B008G4T7W4", "B00E8G5H8W", "B00DOZNGTK", "B000BOH8Y6", "B0003JAOO0", "B000BCCAEQ", "B00ECHBSP8", "B0000VD12I", "B005CFC04W", "0345490207", "B0030E5PYO", "B00BCMT3TO", "B008XB2UCE", "B0024FAG7Q", "B000EOTV98", "B005CFC0N8", "B001DSNEME", "B0024FADD8", "B00466H3A4", "B001B8XRT6", "B0009JE6FM", "B000JLTRHW", "B000062XFG", "B0011FLGZQ", "B00C7A8WZQ", "6305869367", "B0030VANJO", "B003NOGNQU", "B000G1R39E", "B000E5N6B6", "B0024FAR66", "B000T9OP7G", "B00008438U"], "bought_together": ["B000B5IP4W", "B0007CEXUY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000B5IP4W", "B00GT4NCBU", "B004E5BQDW", "B003BNO9GO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 79835}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 34.99, "brand": "Unknown", "asin": "B0007XG2YS", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Y667JVCBL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Outer Limits - The New Series (Aliens Among Us/Death &amp; Beyond/Fantastic Androids &amp; Robots/Mutation and Transformation/Sex &amp; Science Fiction/Time Travel &amp; Infinity Collections)"}
{"description": "Frasier's fifth season is marked by two central themes. First is Roz's (Peri Gilpin) unexpected pregnancy, which naturally opens the door for countless promiscuity jokes for the radio show's beleaguered producer. The second is the continuing drama of Niles (David Hyde Pierce) and his frosty wife, Maris, which seems to finally come to a head. Not that even a good marriage has ever kept Niles from pining for Daphne (Jane Leeves), of course. Frasier's (Kelsey Grammer) show is sailing along, and for the occasion of his 1000th show, is honored by the mayor for \"Frasier Crane Day,\" which allows the cast to do some rare location shooting in Seattle. But he has some problems with KACL management, and the prospect of tough contract negotiations tempts him to return to the Dark Side, in the form of agent Bebe (Harriet Sansom Harris). His personal life continues to sputter, even when he meets a perfect woman (Sela Ward as a fashion model studying zoology, Lindsay Frost as a high-powered defense attorney). The annual guest appearance by ex-wife Lilith (Bebe Neuwirth) comes with a bizarre twist, and his father (John Mahoney) comes to a critical point with his girlfriend (Marsha Mason).Frasierwon its fifth consecutive Emmy for Outstanding Comedy Series, Grammer and Pierce won their third and second statuettes, respectively, and Patti Lupone was nominated for her guest appearance as Frasier's vengeful Greek aunt.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000A0GOQY", "B0006Q93AQ", "B000B5XOUC", "B0001NBNJ8", "B000ERVJMW", "B000MX7V5W", "B000VDDE0Y", "B0002WZTLQ", "B006OKOWUY", "B000A0GOQ4", "B0006IUDYY", "B0007Y08JW", "B0001NBNIY", "B000ERVJMM", "B000B5XOTS", "B0019F02W6", "B001HUHBAY", "B0012EM5EC", "B0000E32X2", "B000I2J6VE", "B00080Z5FM", "B006MFQ4DE", "B000KGGIL4", "B00BHWG0N6", "B000C1VBAA", "B00GHH9HW2", "B00008NV4G", "B00BI3XZA0", "B000BGR1AK", "B000T22PVG", "B0002W4SX6", "B000NTMA1U", "B000I2J6W8", "B008LCRAFC", "B0007KTBJO", "B000BNTM46", "B000EBGFQI", "B009LDD1X0", "B000AJJNJK", "B000Z27H8Q", "B002TQKL16", "B000G1R3A8", "B00EQ2KU7G", "B000BYRCF6", "B00BTFK01Y", "B008LCRA7K", "B0019D151K", "B000K7UBXE", "B000GRU09S", "B000YKYT1M", "B0089BSNQA", "B00GOC74QG", "B00AIA8AKE", "B000VDDDZA", "B0015XWU9A", "B000UP881S", "B000ND91OA", "B000NA1W3Q", "B0006N2EZA", "B0009UC7MK", "B009LDD26Q", "B0001K5GOO", "B000EYK4H6", "B008LCRA98", "B000QFCDAY", "B00IFK7OFG", "B001FB4VXU", "B000GRUMQY", "B0096PBD6U", "B006OKOWDG", "B00A92MD8G", "B00005LC4D", "B00008979F", "B000AJJNIQ", "B0007UDCX0", "B00FM4S7P4", "B005FISCFW", "B0053O89WY", "B003L77G2Y", "B00005JLEX", "B005M5OSBU", "B002N5N4PS", "B000GETU2E", "B00009Y3RW", "B00E7XS4EA", "B000QUEQ6I", "B00FWMVVKY", "B001O4KBO6", "B00I458456", "B003DUBAXK", "B000N8UXTW", "B008LCRABQ", "6305133468", "B002N5N4M6", "B002JVWQUU", "B000209KMW", "0792838947", "B004D2GMVM"], "bought_together": ["B0006Q93AQ", "B000A0GOQY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0001NBNJ8", "B0006Q93AQ", "B000B5XOUC", "B000A0GOQY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 8038}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 18.19, "brand": "Paramount", "asin": "B0007Y08RY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51NPV20JBNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Frasier: Season 5"}

{"description": "Law & Order's third year marked a transitional one for the top-rated drama. In 1992, Jerry Orbach (Prince of the City) joined the cast. His Det. Lenny Briscoe would turn out to be one of its most enduring characters. After Sgt. Phil Ceretta (Paul Sorvino) is shot by a gun dealer in episode eight (\"Prince of Darkness\"), Briscoe teams up with Det. Mike Logan (Chris Noth) in the next (\"Point of View\"). It wasn't meant to be a permanent change (Ceretta was injured, not killed), but the two would continue to beat the streets until Logan's departure in 1995 (Orbach, meanwhile, would remain part of theLaw & Orderuniverse until his passing in 2004).The line-up was otherwise the same: Capt. Donald Craven (Dann Florek), ADA Paul Robinette (Richard Brooks), ADA Benjamin Stone (Michael Moriarty), and DA Adam Schiff (Steven Hill). In the following season, however, Craven will be replaced by Lt. Anita Van Buren (S. Epatha Merkerson), the show's first regular female character (not counting Carolyn McCormick, who was billed as a featured player). The third season would also be Robinette's last; he will be replaced by Claire Kinkaid (Jill Hennessy) in the fourth. Meanwhile, Florek would go on to joinLaw & Order: Special Victims Unitin 1999 (while Noth would joinLaw & Order: Criminal Intentin 2005).DuringLaw & Order's third season, a number of soon-to-be-famous TV actors would put in appearances. They include Lauren Ambrose (Six Feet Under), Claire Danes (My So-Called Life), Felicity Huffman (Desperate Housewives), Edie Falco and Vincent Pastore (The Sopranos), Adam Arkin (Chicago Hope), Michael Badalucco and Camryn Manheim (The Practice), Ron Rifkin (Alias), and Julianna Margulies (E.R.).

{"description": "From Hollywood's legendary Cocoanut Grove to the pioneering conquest of the wild blue yonder, Martin Scorsese'sThe Aviatorcelebrates old-school filmmaking at its finest. We say \"old school\" only because Scorsese's love of golden-age Hollywood is evident in his approach to his subject--Howard Hughes in his prime (played by Leonardo DiCaprio in his)--and especially in his technical mastery of the medium reflecting his love for classical filmmaking of the studio era. Even when he's using state-of-the-art digital trickery for the film's exciting flight scenes (including one of the most spectacular crashes ever filmed), Scorsese's meticulous attention to art direction and costume design suggests an impassioned pursuit of craftsmanship from a bygone era; every frame seems to glow with gilded detail. And while DiCaprio bears little physical resemblance to Hughes during the film's 20-year span (late 1920s to late '40s), he efficiently captures the eccentric millionaire's golden-boy essence, and his tragic descent into obsessive-compulsive seclusion. Bolstered by Cate Blanchett's uncannily accurate portrayal of Katharine Hepburn as Hughes' most beloved lover,The Aviatoris easily Scorsese's most accessible film, inviting mainstream popularity without compromising Scorsese's artistic reputation. As compelling crowd-pleasers go, it's a class act from start to finish.--Jeff ShannonDVD FeaturesIn his commentary track, director Martin Scorsese offers his own impressions of Howard Hughes and rattles off his memories of experiencing Hughes's films.  He mentions how he made Cate Blanchett watch every Katharine Hepburn film from the '30s on the big screen, and observes that Kate Beckinsale had \"a real sense of the stature of a Hollywood goddess.\"  But in general he doesn't talk much about the craft of making the film.  That area is covered better by editor Thelma Schoonmaker, who also appears on the commentary track, and producer Michael Mann makes a few appearances (all were recorded separately).  The picture is brilliant, but the 5.1 sound is not as aggressive in the rear speakers and subwoofer as one might expect, other than some nice surround effects in theHell's Angelsflying sequence.The second disc collects almost three hours of features.  There's one unnecessary deleted scene, and an 11-minute making-of featurette that's basically the cast and director heaping praise on each other.  More interesting are the short featurettes on visual effects (including the XF-11 scene, of course), production design, costumes, hair and makeup, and score, and Loudon Wainwright discusses his and his children's musical performances.  Historical perspective is provided by spotlights on Hughes's role in aviation and his obsessive-compulsive disorder, and a 43-minute Hughes documentary from the History Channel (part of the Modern Marvels series, it focuses on his mechanical innovations and spends less than a minute on his movies).  More unusual are DiCaprio and Scorsese's appearance on an OCD panel, and a half-hour interview segment DiCaprio did with Alan Alda.--David HoriuchiThe Personalities ofThe AviatorClick the links to explore more movies by these stars.Leonardo DiCaprioasHoward Hughes\"Sometimes I truly fear that I... am losing my mind.

{"description": "The fourth season ofThe King of Queensopens with a perfect example of how the show spins real life into farce: Delivery guy Doug and his sardonic wife Carrie (Kevin James and Leah Remini) want to get pregnant, but can't get Carrie's cantankerous father Arthur (Jerry Stiller) out of the house; the only solution their budget will allow is hiring a dog-walker named Holly (Nicole Sullivan) to take Arthur to the park. A more banal sitcom would conclude with Arthur's rage when he discovers the truth, butThe King of Queensfinds a grace note with Arthur and Holly beginning a genuine friendship. Which is not to say thatThe King of Queensgoes for easy sentiment; some of the fourth season's best moments walk a distinctly unsentimental line. When Arthur goes into the hospital for a heart problem, Carrie discovers that he hid a college acceptance letter from her in order to keep her at home. While Arthur lies unconscious, Carrie wrestles with anger and grief--and, thanks to smart writing and Remini's deft performance, it's almost uncomfortably funny.James, Remini, and Stiller form the sitcom equivalent of a rock'n'roll power trio--it's astonishing that so much comedy can come out of just three people.The King of Queenshas solid supporting players (and, towards the end of this season, succumbs to the questionable trend of casting celebrity guest stars), but the skillful interplay between Doug, Carrie, and Arthur drives the vast majority of the show's stories. The fourth season has a handful of episodes that wallow in typical sitcom schtick, but it's impressive how many more episodes remain fresh, lively, and true to these vivid characters. Even an episode that flashes back to Doug and Carrie's wedding--a premise that usually guarantees a saccharine kiss of death--finds a balance of tartness and genuine warmth. Satisfying and well-crafted.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000FBH3WC", "B00070HK4C", "B000GRU09S", "B0001BS3IY", "B000K4X5QM", "B000NA1W3Q", "B0000CGNEC", "B000TGJ82G", "B000BNTM46", "B0007R4SWC", "B006MFQ4DE", "B005DCJ0Q0", "B000A7PKGW", "B004D2GMVM", "B004WO9OMA", "B000T22PVG", "B000RGULLA", "B002AMVEEM", "B000GRUMQY", "B0007YXRCW", "B002N5N4PS", "B0019D151K", "B00079FUI6", "B004MWLXTY", "B000NTMA1U", "B008L0YMZA", "B008L0YN18", "B0007US79Y", "B0001ZMWXW", "B00B04NII6", "B000I2J6W8", "B001L1S1WQ", "B008LCRA98", "B0006IUDYY", "B003L77G7E", "B00B04NJ1M", "B000AJJNIQ", "B0009E27DA", "B0002W4SWW", "B000N8UXTW", "B00005JOHC", "B000I2J6VE", "B0013D8M3U", "B002JH2EJ2", "B0058JEHSO", "B000A0GOQ4", "B000ND91OA", "B001JAHSKU", "B008LCRA7K", "B008LCRAFC", "B0002UE1WQ", "B007C8RZL0", "B005XLFB32", "B005D0OHA6", "B000HT3PEM", "B000EYK4H6", "B001DJLCR2", "B00BXTH474", "B00005JLIB", "B000HT3P6U", "B0007Y08JW", "B002E58FTC", "B0000E32X2", "B00005JLEX", "B0001NBNIY", "B000QFCDAY", "B007C8RZQ0", "B005FISCFW", "B007C8RZYC", "B00003CXIA", "B0000DFZ5O", "B007C8RZJW", "B0018CWEYO", "B008LCRAC0", "B002N5N4M6", "B00EQ2KU7G", "B0007Y08RY", "B0058JEI06", "B005IA9JQ8", "B009LDD3I8", "B000FIMG4U", "B00B04NJ12", "B008L0YN6I", "B000KX0IPO", "B00008J2EB", "B009LDD26Q", "B00A2XQU7M", "B001DZOCVO", "B000W91RUG", "B000TD4N9W", "B000B5XOTS", "B007C8RZXS", "B0014FAIYS", "B00FM4S7P4", "B000EBGFQI", "B006UKX628", "B0038M2AQE", "B00441GZ2S"], "bought_together": ["B00070HK4C", "B000FBH3WC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005D0OHA6", "B0001BS3IY", "B00070HK4C", "B0000CGNEC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 44213}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 8.65, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B000957O8C", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RpGuOxJ-L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The King of Queens: Season 4"}
{"description": "Dark Wateris Japanese horror auteur Hideo Nakata's return to the genre after hisRingcycle made you too scared to watch television ever again. WhereRingudealt with a supernatural force wreaking revenge via technology, this film is a much more traditional ghost story. After winning a custody battle for her daughter, single mother Yoshimi moves into what she thinks is the perfect apartment with her daughter Hitomi. No sooner have they unpacked than strange things begin to disturb their new life. A water leak from the supposedly abandoned apartment above gets bigger and bigger, a child's satchel reappears even though Yoshimi throws it away several times, and she is haunted by the image of a child wearing a yellow mackintosh who bears a striking resemblance to a young girl who disappeared several years before. The conventional narrative follows Yoshimi's increasingly desperate attempts to discover who or what force is haunting her daughter, but the story's execution is far from predictable. Nakata is the master of understated suspense: there's always a feeling of motiveless malignancy that runs like an undercurrent through his films--far more frightening than out and out shocks--and here he also practically drowns his audience in water imagery. The film is saturated; the relentless dripping in the apartment, the constant rain outside and the deliberately washed-out photography make any color, such as the yellow coat, seem incongruous and unsettling. Nakata also clears the film of unnecessary characters--this is an almost deserted Tokyo--preferring to concentrate the action on Yoshimi's rising hysteria as she struggles to understand what is happening and how to save her daughter. Granted, the special effects are somewhat unconvincing and the ending confused, but even so the result is a stylish and disquieting chiller that will do for bathtubs what hisRingfilms did for video recorders.--Kristen Bowditch", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000GSYRY6", "B000E0OE4O", "B00005JNJR", "B000GB5MOW", "B000LPS3B2", "B000H0M4CK", "B000E3LGMY", "B000A2XA8M", "B004O63TWW", "B00DW5IM14", "B000AWYOGE", "B000Q7ZKWU", "B000088NQR", "B0000AVHAO", "B000FS9FIA", "B003UTPL2A", "B000FVQYW2", "B000MEYKCI", "B000FZEQEQ", "B002P7UCJK", "B0000CC885", "B0009KQOZQ", "B0009WFEDC", "B000H5U5YO", "B000MM0LHS", "B0007XBM8O", "B000NO243E", "B000CSTKHE", "B0009X765K", "B0006SGYL0", "B000AAF25S", "B000MM0LH8", "B0018JKLT2", "B000GBEWNY", "B001KEGR66", "B000FZEQFK", "B0028DRGDQ", "B00BOYLIAC", "B000NA28GG", "B00136MBUW", "B0019X3YX2", "B00005LW4G", "B0002ZDW7Q", "B000CRR3ME", "B004P2VQZ2", "B0007CNY2W", "B0009YA3YA", "B000BVM240", "B00260LDSU", "B0009S2T0M", "B0002J4X20", "B002E2QH8G", "B00009MEC4", "B000FZEQVY", "B0000YAEHK", "B002U041OE", "B00HI9QDXO", "B001570H5K", "B00AEFYYH6", "B000NA21RM", "B0015ET3YO", "B0007GAG42", "B0009NCQL4", "B000F0UUMI", "B001VG2MAI", "B004H2CXBQ", "B00104AYG0", "B001MEJY8W", "B00125WAW8", "B000BGH2A4", "B000AM4PGI", "B001P3SA9Y", "B000EDWKZ6", "B0010SAGHS", "B000A2X3U2", "B0009W5KHW", "B000S0GYRU", "B00344EAM8", "B005D0RDPM", "B001221DUQ", "B0000CABGW", "B002OMIKSG", "B00BUBE2N4", "B008NNY8XQ", "B00019JR5Y", "B00AEFY2E6", "B0009XRZQK", "B006L4MWVE", "B00BOUXNNQ", "B00004W3HF", "B008G1JIQC", "B007I1Q4IG", "B000R7HY32", "B00GHH9IIA", "B0009X763M", "B00006AUIG", "B00009OWI1", "B0001EFV7M", "B000IMUYJM", "B0016MJ6KQ"], "bought_together": ["B000E0OE4O", "B000GSYRY6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000AWYOGE", "B00DW5IM14", "B000GSYRY6", "B0009WFEDC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 135749}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 13.99, "brand": "ADV Films", "asin": "B0009KA2UO", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41KFCTBTH3L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Dark Water"}

{"description": "The charm, the zaniness, the corny jokes, the showbiz cliches--every element ofThe Muppet Showholds up 30 years after Jim Henson's legendary variety series' debut season. Well, perhaps not everything: Today's younger viewers might have a hard time placing some ofThe Muppet Show's then-guest stars, such as Florence Henderson or Ruth Buzzi. But then, theShow's real celebrities are perennial icons Kermit the Frog, Miss Piggy, Gonzo the... whatever, Fozzie Bear, Animal, and the rest of the Muppets' harried, well-meaning family of entertainers.Season Onefinds the show pretty much in the basic shape longtime fans will remember: A musical introduction followed by backstage chaos, another musical number, a sketch, a scene with the guest star, and so on. A half-hour episode can fly by pretty quickly, but it's interesting to note that the series hadn't quite found its familiar tone through much of the first year. A reliance on too many disposable verbal jokes and redundant, so-so material for sketch fodder ultimately gives way to more creative premises and the development of key relationships between characters. By the final half-dozen episodes in the first season,The Muppet Showis truly cooking. Season highlights include Kermit's confession to guest Juliet Prowse that he always wanted to be a dancer, and Prowse's comparison of the little green superstar to Robert Redford. Joel Grey does a cabaret-style act for a roomful of Muppets and is later outraged when Kermit's introduction of the actor proves so thorough there is nothing left for the latter to say. Rita Moreno proves quite game in a funny piece, set in a French cafe, in which her dance with a man-size Muppet turns from romantic to table-smashing violent. Harvey Korman plays bumbling ringmaster Maurice the Magnificent, easily the worst animal trainer in history. Phyllis Diller bats out shameless one-liners (\"I sang 'Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star,' and it fell on me\"), and Vincent Price toys with his own horror film image by playing a ghoul who turns into a maudlin orchestra conductor at midnight.--Tom KeoghStills fromThe Muppet Show(click for larger image)The divine Miss PiggyKermit and Miss PiggyFozzie Bear and KermitSing along!Everyone's a critic", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000Q6774K", "B0013527I4", "B00CUEIP56", "B00CUDD0KW", "B004EPZ03O", "B000ATQYTW", "B00005JO4H", "B000ATQYTC", "B00EDUCO3O", "B00005BCJR", "B006JTS5OO", "0316182990", "B00I8VLDFE", "B0062DB7K6", "B00AP2DA9G", "B00BCMT4B6", "1465417486", "B0000A2ZU9", "B00I8VLE76", "B0052LE7BA", "B000ATQYT2", "B003XURDCC", "B0000844MM", "B000H6SY8C", "B000AA4F2O", "B00006AUHR", "B000UNYJTK", "B0052LE7A6", "B00H4RL2H2", "B00I8VLBZG", "B000CCBCA8", "B005UQHDPY", "0316277630", "B000H6SY1E", "B00B2ZZV5G", "0679412034", "B0062DCBZ6", "B00000JYLT", "B00IKSI1UU", "B0069RY7V6", "B008I218K8", "B006345IB8", "B00961EO1A", "B007KW5MJU", "B0001I55O2", "B0016MJ73W", "0345526112", "B0062KMDWU", "B0050MB5AC", "B00005JKTY", "B0000AYJXV", "B00465I1BA", "B002TJ23KA", "B000YERP2S", "B00961ENYI", "0316058432", "B006WNSHUY", "B00I6JOBTI", "B005F96UJ6", "B00B98HG18", "B009Z4W140"], "bought_together": ["B000Q6774K", "B0013527I4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000Q6774K", "B00CUEIP56", "B0013527I4", "B004EPZ03O"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 8440}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 30.49, "brand": "Disney", "asin": "B0009ULBGS", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5121HCDPQKL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Muppet Show: Season 1"}
{"description": "It's virtually impossible to approachNo Direction Homewithout a cluster of fixed ideas. Who doesn't have their own private Dylan? The true excellence of Martin Scorsese's achievement lies in how his documentary shakes us free of our comfortable assumptions. In the process, it plays out on several levels at once, each taking shape as an unfailingly fascinating narrative. There is, of course, the central story of an individual genius staking out his artistic identity. But along with thisBildungsromancome other threads and contexts: most notably, the role of popular culture in postwar America, art's self-reliance versus its social responsibilities, and fans' complicity with the publicity machine in sustaining myths. All of these threads reinforce each other, together weaving the film's intricate texture.Scorsese's 200-plus-minute focus on Dylan's earliest years allows for a portrayal of unprecedented depth, with multiple angles: a rich composite photo is the result. The main narrative has an epic quality: it moves from Dylan growing up in cold-war Minnesota through Greenwich Village coffeehouses and the Newport Folk Festival, climaxing in the controversial 1966 U.K. tour that crowned a period of unbridled and explosive creativity. In his transition from Robert Allen Zimmerman to Bob Dylan, we observe him concocting his impossible-to-describe, unique combination of the topical with the archaic, like an ancient oracle. Scorsese was able to access previously unseen footage from the Dylan archives, including performances, press conferences, and recording sessions. He also uses interviews with Dylan's friends, ex-friends, and fellow artists, and, intriguingly, with the notoriously reclusive Dylan himself (who looks back to provide glosses on the early years), fusing what could have turned into a tiresome series of digressions and tangents into a powerful whole as enlightening, eccentric, contradictory, and ultimately irreducible as its subject.Some of the deeply personal bits remain unrevealed, but Dylan's preternatural self-assurance acquires a slightly self-deprecating, even comic edge via some of his reflective comments. Alongside the arrogance, we see touching moments of the young artist's reverence for Woody Guthrie and Johnny Cash. Joan Baez, in a poignant confessional mood, comes off well, and the late Allen Ginsberg is so seraphically charming he almost steals the show a few times. A crucial throughline is Dylan's hunger for recognition and ability to shape perceptions so that would be singled out as not just another dime-a-dozen folk singer. It's illuminating--particularly for those familiar with the artist's latter-day aloofness on stage--to see his reactions to audience booing in the wake of his \"betrayal\" in this fuller context.No Direction Homealso makes clear--in a way that wasn't possible in D.A. Pennebaker's iconicDon't Look Back--how Dylan's ability to manipulate his persona always, at its core, protects the urge for expression: Dylan's ultimate mandate, as an artist, is never to be pinned down. As Scorsese masterfully shows, the myth around Dylan only grows bigger the more we discover about him.--Thomas MayDVD features: This two-disc set of Scorsese's full two-part documentary includes treats such as Dylan working on a song at his hotel during the UK tour as well as performing several songs as in concert or on TV.More for the DylanologistNo Direction Home: The SoundtrackChronicles: Volume One(paperback edition)Bob Dylan ScrapbookDon't Look BackThe Bob Dylan Bootleg SeriesThe Last Waltz", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000KJU1HI", "B000W1V5TM", "B0013D8L7C", "B004FOPFFW", "B0001MDQ6W", "0743244583", "B000A4AWRW", "B008HFS4XU", "B00000F2L9", "0743230418", "B00003CXB1", "B002LMOAUQ", "B00026WU9Q", "0743228154", "B00026WU64", "B005F9TQAQ", "B0009MAP9A", "1617130125", "B000002AJG", "B00000D9TO", "B00026WU8M", "B0014DZ2XC", "B0000DG069", "B000002C2E", "B00026WU82", "B007JWKLMO", "B0009MAP90", "B001SF8G1G", "B001SF8G1Q", "B001NERPHS", "B000F48D00", "B004J4T1M6", "B0040GJ312", "B000BC8SVA", "B005F9TQ4C", "B005F9TQ0Q", "B00026WU7I", "B0012GMUP4", "B008DVJOOG", "B00HQI823Q", "B000EZ7ZZ4", "B00026WU50", "B001D06SEI", "B000X1ZPEM", "B00HQI7VMY", "B00028HODG", "B00026WU3M", "B007JWKLP6", "B00004YZFR", "0452264456", "B00B0FRQCO", "B0012GMX56", "B000VS6P9Q", "1605984817", "B005F9TQ9C", "B000ION7C6", "B0016GLZ42", "B00026WU5U", "0767926889", "B00006NT3H", "B004T5IVXK", "B000008TFC", "B005F9TQ2Y", "B0015XAT3O", "B001NHZ2KM", "B000GFLAI0", "B00JZO33VK", "1932958096", "B0007GADYU", "B00026WU6O", "B000NRRWOM", "B00DW5IM9Q", "B001VNB56I", "B009F70VB2", "1439169640", "B001NXDSLQ", "0743231015", "B0012GMW16", "B0018PH3OC", "B00AEBB928", "B00H3JHH6Q", "B00KF1CWF0", "B001U3HUOU", "B00E51KKNC", "0470636238", "1400045967", "B003O5MOF2", "B00008GKEG", "B008LZHA3G", "0743228286", "B0012GN2JC", "0802145523", "0394542789", "B00F6Y3FKW", "B0012GMYLY", "B00EO2I6T2", "B000000XF7", "B000BT96DC", "B0040LAHA8", "B00GMV8KGW"], "bought_together": ["B000KJU1HI", "B0013D8L7C"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0743244583", "B000KJU1HI", "B000W1V5TM", "B0013D8L7C"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 16996}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 9.12, "brand": "Paramount Pictures", "asin": "B000A0GP4K", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51R44SP2HCL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Bob Dylan - No Direction Home"}

{"description": "House of Dis a bittersweet, moving story of an American expatriate's painful decision to come to terms with the childhood he fled in early 1970s New York City. David Duchovny wrote and directed this comedy-drama; he also stars as the adult version of the film's hero, Tom Warshaw, an illustrator who has spent most of his life in Paris and decides&#x97;on the occasion of his son's birthday&#x97;to finally reveal long-withheld facts about his past.The bulk of the story, told in flashback, portrays 13-year-old Tom (Anton Yelchin) as a quick-witted prince of his neighborhood, a delivery boy who knows every eccentric on his bicycle route and a Catholic school kid fond of playing pranks on his clueless French teacher and soulful principal (Frank Langella). His best friend is the school's mildly retarded, 41-year-old janitor, Pappas (Robin Williams), and his advisor on matters of the heart is Lady (Erykah Badu), a prison inmate whom the fatherless Tom (or Tommy, as he's called in 1973) can neither see nor touch. Tommy's vivacity is an asset at home, where his mother (Tea Leoni), a grieving widow with a mounting addiction to pills, is slipping away from her son's ability to help. Duchovny's screenplay sometimes borders on the precious: A number of scenes are enamored with their own boldness and originality, as if Duchovny has been squirreling away lots of colorfully expressive storytelling details for years, and unloaded them here. But that flaw all but disappears in the glow ofHouse of D's emotional resonance and honesty, not to mention several exceptional performances. Among these is Zelda Williams's work as Tommy's sage-beyond-her-years girlfriend, Melissa, whose name offers a suitable excuse to work a rather lovely Allman Brothers song into the soundtrack.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0019X3YTQ", "B0007XG4XW", "B0043X1FM2", "6305262128", "B00008L3U1", "B00005UQ9V", "B00J5JSV3A", "B000N4RAR4", "B00005V9HT", "B00175VSBC", "B00BX8PG5M", "B0002XNT1C", "B004SIP6VI", "B00007AJFD", "6304584210", "B00114XTHA", "B003EYVXOG", "6306012419", "B000085EFG", "B0019X3YUA", "B003IQBLSI", "B0000694XY", "B000BYA4IS", "B00000IQV7", "B000YV1Q2G", "B00AEFXGIY", "B004SUDQ72", "B003LR5BD0", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B0071HPOLK", "B002PI1NRO", "0788815466", "B001FACH7S", "B004ZJZQAQ", "B004SIP6C2", "B008220A62", "B00003CWS3", "B000B8QG22", "B004SIP7ZS", "B0009H97HG", "B003EYVXOQ", "B00007976U", "B005QX8U2Q", "B0013N2WFY", "B00079HZOS", "B00133KFGW", "B000FDEVA2", "B002QQ8HAG", "B00000J11D", "1558908404", "B000OYC7BW", "B00BTYRB3U", "B00AEFYMGO", "B006YTGL86", "B00003CXQ4", "B000M341SC", "B000035Z3C", "B000077VQ6", "B000286RP2", "B000LC5B7O", "B0000714C4", "B002GIBVVQ", "B000NO39FG", "B003B3O5K4", "B00CYQXCDK", "B00AEFYVZQ", "B00003CXE4", "B00003CX8N", "B00GSBMNOQ", "B000063US3", "B00DL46ZN8", "B0007X7044", "B001CIOCLC", "B0043X1FL8", "B001JIE7JC", "B009AMAL4Y", "B00CCXL9OE", "B000P5FH3K", "B00004Y62V", "B0009UZGIM", "B000957O82"], "bought_together": ["B0007XG4XW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0007XG4XW", "B00BTYNXJG", "B0019X3YTQ", "B000UAE7KO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 175614}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.73, "brand": "LION&#39;S GATE ENTERTAINMENT", "asin": "B000ARFPNK", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51K4DAM9FWL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "House of D"}

{"description": "The fifth season ofSeinfeldis without a doubt the series' best. By their fifth year, theSeinfeldgang had ironed out the bumps from the first two seasons, further developing characters.  The loyal fan base that had been accumulating over the years was now more or less the entire nation&#x92;s viewing audience. The pressure was on to give this new, mega fan base a high dose of their unique, misanthropic comedy, and Jerry (Jerry Seinfeld), George (Jason Alexander), Elaine (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) and Kramer (Michael Richards) delivered in spades. Yes, other seasons may have funnier individual episodes, but as a whole season five consistently delivers the goods, including many of the show's all-time classic episodes.  In the season opener, Jerry discovers the secret, sexual power of \"The Mango.\" While vacationing in \"The Hamptons\" we not only learn that George&#x92;s date likes to sunbathe topless in front of his friends, but also that cold water has the power to shrink. In \"The Stall&#x92; Elaine is rejected while trying to share toilet paper only to learn that the selfish neighbor is Jerry&#x92;s girlfriend.  In order to really make a life change, George decides to do \"The Opposite\" of all his instincts and surprisingly everything in his life falls perfectly into place. And of course, who can forget the ridiculous puffy shirt Kramer&#x92;s low-talking girlfriend talks Jerry into wearing onThe Today Show. This box set also includes the featurette \"Jason+Larry=George\" explaining how Jason Alexander embodied Larry David&#x92;s alter ego to create George Costanza, plus deleted and behind-the-scenes footage and exclusive stand up footage of Jerry Seinfeld.--Rob Bracco", "related": {"also_bought": ["B008LCRA7K", "B0007YXRCW", "B008LCRA98", "B008LCRABQ", "B0002UE1WQ", "B008LCRAC0", "B00005JLEX", "B00070HK4C", "B0001BS3IY", "B0002UE1X0", "B001AEF6AY", "B0001NBNJ8", "B000FBH3WC", "B007KFZ8B4", "B000M341S2", "B000MX7V5W", "B0000E2PVR", "B00BXTH474", "B004SIP9O2", "B00EQ2KU7G", "B000067S1G", "B003TNW030", "B0024FAD9W", "B000Y7U9AK", "B000SINT4S", "B000T22PVG", "B002VJ05E4", "B00005AVCA", "B000957O8C", "B000BOH98G", "B0058EE6O4", "B0009VBTP0", "B00005N5S5", "B000ERVJMW", "B000NA1W3Q", "B0019D151K", "B002E58FU6", "B009LDD4BO", "B000NOKFH6", "B00BUWD7Y8", "B002E58FT2", "B000G6BL88", "B007KFZ8AA", "B000GETTKM", "B002GHHHP6", "B000RO6JZY", "B000AQ68VO", "B005IA9JQ8", "B000P0J06U", "B0007YMVWO", "B0007Y08RY", "B00008PW1F", "B004FQX59I", "0790732157", "B003L77G9W", "B003L77GDS", "B003UD7JAI", "B009LDD1X0", "B000OHZKZ4", "B00K8HAJN8", "B00016JE5U", "B004STBFPS", "B00E96AY20", "B00005JLYW", "B00I458456", "B00FEVZ960", "B005D0OHA6", "B00FE5MZWM", "B00BT1XCOU", "B0053O89WY", "B000VNMMPW", "B00HNGC56G", "B0007DFJ0G", "B000K7VHTQ", "B000065V3E", "B005IA9JVI", "0936070463", "B0083XXWRE", "B005IA9JQI", "B005IA9JRM", "B000G6BLWE"], "bought_together": ["B008LCRA7K", "B008LCRA98"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0007YXRCW", "B0002UE1WQ", "B008LCRA98", "B008LCRA7K"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 26980}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 13.49, "brand": "Sony Pictures", "asin": "B000BBOUEU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51N5PWdD5ML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Seinfeld: Season 5"}

He is probably the planet's worst-suited person to run such an establishment: he makes no effort to sell, closes at strange hours on a whim, is in a perpetual alcoholic stupor, abhors his customers (sometimes physically abusing them) and is often comatose at his desk. Help comes in the lumpy shape of Manny Bianco, a hairy, bumbling individual who (almost by osmosis) becomes Bernard's assistant. Manny is not exactly great at the job either but he is a million times better than Bernard. Next door is Fran, an anxious, frustrated woman who runs a sort of new-age shop selling the most unlikely bits of arty junk. Fran is friends with Bernard and, through him, with Manny; together the trio become embroiled in escapades that are sometimes extreme or violent or fantastically ludicrous, and always bizarre.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000HC2LXU", "B000TSTEPK", "014026065X", "B0019MFY3Q", "B001NOMOS8", "B001YYQA0K", "B002EOVX9W", "B00443FN1A", "B00JJRLG7G", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B001G1FL4C", "B000YIGNKY", "B000A2UBOS", "B002LFPAUM", "B00HUAGYF8", "B0009NSCTY", "B000TSTEPA", "B00FPPQYXM", "B0000797E5", "B00005A1SY", "B001V7UXG2", "B00DQEHKZ0", "B003TY2STU", "B005E7SEES", "B001PMRBMC", "B005LAJ1LS", "B000VB4ZSG", "B001EHF3RI", "B002AL2TPQ", "B00G15MDI0", "B004ALIG2O", "B000LPS34E", "B002LFPAUC", "B00E3UN66I", "B00E3UN44W", "B00003CWOU", "B0050N0US4", "B00E3UN59Q", "B00A27OJ94"], "bought_together": ["B000TSTEPK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000TSTEPK", "B001NOMOS8", "B001YYQA0K", "B0019MFY3Q"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 25452}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 55.49, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B000BVM1SW", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51H4GWRQ1JL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Black Books - The Complete First Series"}

Charlize Theron (Monster) plays Josey Aimes, who goes to work at a Minnesota steel mine after splitting with her violent husband.Frances McDormand and CharlizeTheron inNorth Country.But the job proves to be almost as harrowing as her marriage; the male miners, resentful of women taking jobs, verbally abuse and play humiliating pranks on the female miners. After being physically assaulted by a coworker, Josey tries to fight against the harassment, but none of the other women will join her case for fear that things will only get worse.North Country, directed by Niki Caro (Whale Rider), makes the women's experience palpable for the audience without overdoing it. But the lawsuit is only part of the movie; the gut impact ofNorth Countrycomes from the devastating effect the lawsuit has on Josey's family, friends, and coworkers--thanks to an incredible ensemble cast that includes Sissy Spacek (In the Bedroom), Sean Bean (Lord of the Rings), Richard Jenkins (Six Feet Under), Woody Harrelson (The People vs. Larry Flynt), and the always powerful Frances McDormand (Fargo,Mississippi Burning). The courtroom histrionics don't always ring true, but the family conflict is riveting and deeply moving. Based on the bookClass Action: The Story of Lois Jenson and the Landmark Case That Changed Sexual Harassment Law. --Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000A3XY5A", "B002S5N052", "B0029Z8K74", "B00007AJE1", "1256860298", "B000HC2M2K", "B0006J27WO", "B0015LPRZQ", "B000059HAN", "B00026L9CU", "B000FJGR76", "B000KX0HFK", "B000A2X3MU", "B0015OKWK8", "B0025KVKDO", "B00AEFXCLU", "630542828X", "B00AEFXBPM", "B004V8W52S", "B0001XAQ9Q", "B000P5FH3K", "B00003CXFV", "B00ECXJBN8", "B004SUDQAE", "B00005OSLC", "B00002E22E", "B003UESJFQ", "0385496133", "B003EYVXTG", "B004SIP9CO", "B001G5RSRG", "B00J0IN6Z4", "B00IJS2OHM", "B0007R4SX6", "B00008EYA5", "B002ZG99N6", "B00003CWRX", "B0029Z8K7E", "0783240325", "B000I2J736", "B0011V7PSC", "B0073U2EWM", "B002GIBVWA", "B0045HCJHQ", "B004P7CMVE", "6305065551", "B00BTYJYOY", "B00B27WTOK", "B0010DR4BO", "B0034G4P30", "B006GRWCF2", "B0003JAOAY", "B00006HAWN", "B0007P0YKY", "B000GNOSCW", "B000F1IO3E", "B000068QP0", "B006VY8CZE", "B00003CWN3", "0780628551", "B004SIP6C2", "B000ETRCMQ", "B004SIP71M", "B008NNY98U", "B00013RC2U", "B00006FDCC", "0800141806", "B001BMN1YS", "B0045O2PHS", "0783231202", "B00008RV1F", "0783229402", "B000BYRCQU", "B004EQAVA0", "B0010YSD7W", "B00GOT1244", "B0009A40EI", "B00123C7SW", "B00005JLD4", "B00GUO2SKA", "B002NZK5RI", "B004SEUJOQ", "B0000B1OFL", "B000JLTRG8", "B00003CXP7", "B008MIYKLW", "B000092T3P", "B0009KA7XG", "B00GS08Y3Q", "B00IVLRC6K", "B001BEK8A6", "B00AEBB8ZG", "B00007BKVC", "B006GL8O0U", "B00G4Q3KOC", "B00005JLZN", "B000GI3KGC", "B00005JNQA", "B00AEFXT1S", "0078029171"], "bought_together": ["B000A3XY5A"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0029Z8K74", "B000059HAN", "B00007AJE1", "B000A3XY5A"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 5352}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.74, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B000CQLZ8S", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5152Q5R8SEL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "North Country (Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "In his third feature, director Noah Baumbach scores a triumph with an autobiographical coming-of-age story about a teenager whose writer-parents are divorcing.  The father (Jeff Daniels) and mother (Laura Linney) duke it out in half-civilized, half-savage fashion, while their two sons adapt in different ways, shifting allegiances between parents.  The film is squirmy-funny and nakedly honest about the rationalizations and compensatory snobbisms of artistic failure as well as the conflicted desires of adolescents for sex and status.  In detailing bohemian-bourgeois life in brownstone Brooklyn, Baumbach is spot on.  Everyone proceeds from good intentions and acts rather badly, in spite or because of their manifest intelligence.  Fulfilling the best traditions of the American independent film, this quirky, wisely written feature explores the gulf between sexes, generations, art and commerce, Brooklyn and Manhattan.", "related": {"also_bought": ["0767821408", "6305428239", "B0010X8NF0", "B0000640VJ", "B0007UC8Y4", "B001QOGYBI", "B002ZG97T2", "B0011NVC8Y", "B007L6VR12", "B000FUF7DA", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B0006TPE4C", "B00005JLX8", "B00007AJF8", "B00005JLRE", "B0014GI6I2", "B00000G02H", "B001P3SA8K", "B004SEUIW4", "B003102JDM", "B00005JMJG", "B00H9HZITU", "B0024HH2WG", "081099741X", "B0081FSMII", "B00005JMJ4", "B003Q7B7CO", "B001E95ZNS", "B00EO2I6SI", "B003L20ICE", "B008220DGE", "B002ZG97TC", "B0035G5IOE", "B009B8YZCQ", "B000C20VVE", "B007L6VR6M", "B0083V2W4U", "B003KGBIS4", "B00003CXQ4", "B000K7VHQE", "B000E33VWW", "B000BX8R1A", "B007UW9W32", "B00003CWTI", "B003N82OP0", "B008Y1YJMM", "B001HN699A", "B000M4RG7E", "B00AEFY8MM", "B00AEBB9CS", "B00GMV8KGW", "B000M5B98A", "B005LAIGF0", "B00GMV8L1Q", "B00JAQJNN0", "B00J5LXQKQ", "B00005AUJK", "B003UESJLU", "B00005Q4CS", "1572527005", "B0016MJ6HY", "B001UV4XGU", "B0089XJXRQ", "B002AFX53M", "B003U6SJYU", "B00IXPQU6M", "B00CIOD6HK", "B001UV4XUG", "B0045O2PHS", "B00007976U", "B005HK13SG", "B000PAAJZ6", "B00606P0BM", "B0002DB52M", "B001DJ7PR8", "B00AEFYSWM", "B004UVYQVY", "B00004XPP8", "B002LVVCJY", "0802867189", "0830827048", "B00008K7AO", "B00D3LA5WG", "B0012E2GFK", "B001CW7ZT4", "B0007OCG5G", "B00005JLSK", "B00AG4760C", "B000FVQM2Y", "0809141183", "0830828052", "B004UXUX4Q", "B000CNESTE", "0205827195", "B00008DP4C", "6304907729", "B005PTMPYA", "B00003CXDJ", "B0042U9B3G", "B0008JIJ10"], "bought_together": ["0767821408", "6305428239"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0007UC8Y4", "B0010X8NF0", "B0000640VJ", "0767821408"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 67820}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.54, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B000CS464G", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Q2MVZ5QRL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Squid and the Whale (Special Edition)"}

{"description": "Pitch BlackOwing a major debt toAlienand its cinematic spawn,Pitch Blackis a guilty pleasure that surpasses expectations. As he did withThe Arrival, director David Twohy revitalizes a derivative story, allowing you to forgive its flaws and submit to its visceral thrills. Under casual scrutiny, the plot's logic crumbles like a stale cookie, but it's definitely fun while it lasts.A spaceship crashes on a desert planet scorched under three suns. The mostly doomed survivors include a resourceful captain (Radha Mitchell), a drug-addled cop (Cole Hauser), and a deadly prisoner (Vin Diesel) who quickly escapes. These clashing personalities discover that the planet is plunging into the darkness of an extended eclipse, and it's populated by hordes of ravenous, razor-fanged beasties that only come out at night. The body count rises, andPitch Blacksettles into familiar sci-fi territory.What sets the movie apart is Twohy's developing visual style, suggesting that this veteran of B-movie schlock may advance to the big leagues. Like the makers ofThe Blair Witch Project, Twohy understands the frightening power of suggestion; his hungry monsters are better heard than seen (although once seen, they're chillingly effective), andPitch Blackgets full value from moments of genuine panic. Best of all, Twohy's got a well-matched cast, with Mitchell (so memorable with Ally Sheedy inHigh Art) and Diesel (Pvt. Caparzo fromSaving Private Ryan) being the standouts. The latter makes the most of his muscle-man role, and his character's development is one more reason this movie works better than it should.--Jeff ShannonDark Fury - The Chronicles of Riddick (Animated)Taking a page fromThe Animatrix, Dark Furyis part of a new trend of bridging theatrical sequels. As an official product of a franchise, the 35-minute anime benefits from having the original actors voice the characters, including Vin Diesel as Riddick. This story opens with the new action hero and the two other survivors ofPitch Blackalready caught by a giant spaceship filled with dread. The sinewy leader has a unique--and creepy--jail for master villains and she has her sights set on Riddick. The film--indeed the series--is indebted to animator Peter Chung, who brings his techno style from hisAeon Fluxseries. His smooth animation for Riddick doesn't reinvent the character as much as give him a new, appealing fluidity. As anime goes, there's nothing really new here--plenty of action, cool killers, and dramatic spurts of blood--but it's a building block for how this genre might enliven movie series and sequels in the future.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00A2H9OSK", "B001KMB6X2", "B002GSXKNI", "B001VLFE7G", "B001DJLD1M", "B006VRRGNK", "B00005JL3K", "B000ASATYY", "B00007LB4C", "B000WCN8QO", "B003Y5H5EW", "B000FGGE68", "B0002VEUV2", "B008JFUS0U", "B001GUYB08", "B00009ZPUA", "B00A2H9OZS", "B0009MDPYM", "B0002KVUKM", "B008JFUN50", "B001F7MSFM", "B008JFUO36", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B001AV3BYK", "B001AK3S4Y", "B0001O3YD0", "B008JFUOWM", "B00005N5S5", "B008JFURII", "B00005JL78", "6305692688", "B0009DWL8W", "B000QXDED6", "B000F6IOC0", "B00177Y9ZC", "B00AEFXCLU", "B000XT1P4S", "B00H1RMWYW", "B009MO57H6", "B003Q6D2B4", "B001QB9H1U", "B008JFUNHI", "B00E5I2M9K", "B000REQQGQ", "B00006JDVV", "B005LAIIMG", "B003YAR97K", "B000FFJ826", "1558908846", "B002UZCJ8Y", "B00005JNTI", "B0053FANPY", "B00HEPDGKA", "B004LWZW4M", "B0007P0Y7C", "B00005JN0T", "B008JFUS5A", "B00BEIYH1A", "B00D2ZF24O", "B008JFUQZ2", "B001HN697M", "B006ZL1P66", "B0049IHX2C", "0800195175", "B00070FX5U", "B00DMEBXDE", "B004LWZW8I", "B00H83EUQW", "B0000959N0", "B002SG7Z7A", "B001OQCVI8", "B000U1ZV8K", "B001GCUO1Q", "B007X4ECMI", "B004EPYZSK", "B001ILHY1I", "B002VPE1BQ", "B009AMALGM", "B000VG66XS", "B002NXSRVG", "B0053FANRC", "B0053FANQS", "B00BFZBSNM", "B002ZG98LO", "B008Y1YK9Y", "B005LAII3A", "B00AZMFJYA", "0780622650", "B0067QPVJ6", "B001UV4XGA", "B004CQZFH6", "155890848X", "B001DZOC6Y", "B002VPE1AW", "B005COLETU", "B001ECDVKE", "B0034G4OUO", "B004LWZWFQ", "B004XQO90O", "B002ZG98UA"], "bought_together": ["B00A2H9OSK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00GHP8TAA", "B00A2H9OSK", "B0002VEUV2", "B0001O3YD0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 26374}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 35.99, "brand": "Universal Studios", "asin": "B000EQHXN2", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51bGKlKqFFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Riddick Trilogy (Pitch Black / The Chronicles of Riddick: Dark Fury / The Chronicles of Riddick)"}
{"description": "London, a film written and directed by Hunter Richards, warns against the allure of cocaine as protagonist Sid (Chris Evans), loses his girlfriend, London, and also loses his mind from drug use. Set mostly in a bathroom at London's going away party, the film features Sid doing coke with various model-type chicks, while mustering up courage to go downstairs and make peace with his ex-girlfriend. London (Jessica Biel) instigates their breakup after sleeping around and failing to help Sid's depression, culminating in his suicide attempt. Sid's angst builds in the bathroom, as he gets higher, creating a tortured scenario reminiscent ofWho's Afraid of Virginia Woolf. Finally, Sid faces London and starts a chaotic brawl. A side-plot involves Bateman (Jason Stathham), the coke dealer devoted to counseling Sid. Bateman soothes Sid's pain by describing the real frustration of impotency, manifesting itself in a love for S&M; clubs. With such a simplistic plot,Londonis as devoid of logic as the lifestyle it glamorizes, making its pointlessness ingeniously vapid. Sid's quest for sanity is difficult to empathize with, since he&#x92;s an egotistical, drug-addled loser.

Unfortunately, the thugs who dumped the body in the first place (Tim Blake Nelson,O Brother, Where Art Thou?, and W. Earl Brown,Deadwood) want it back, so they kidnap Barnell's wife (Holly Hunter,Raising Arizona), who may or may not have Tourette's Syndrome. Meanwhile, an obsessive insurance agent (Giovanni Ribisi,Saving Private Ryan) smells something fishy and thinks he's found the case that will get him and his phone psychic girlfriend (Alison Lohman,White Oleander) transferred to warmer climes, and Barnell's long-missing brother (Woody Harrelson,White Men Can't Jump) returns, a bit perturbed to learn he's dead.The Big Whitesuffers from an overload of quirkiness--phone psychics, Tourette's, and possibly gay hit men are a lot of whimsy for one movie--but the actors commit themselves to their roles with gusto. The movie misses the bullseye thatFargohit, but fans of macabre comedy may enjoyThe Big White.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000BYA4IS", "B0000633R5", "B00005QCTY", "6305262128", "B002PI1NRO", "B00008L3U1", "630587493X", "B003LR5BD0", "B004SUDQB8", "B0036VHJ5Y", "B00079HZOS", "B00007976U", "B000LC5B7O", "B00005V9HT", "B0045O2PFK", "B007C4ZJ0S", "B000FKO5QK", "B00005JKN2", "6304584210", "B00HGJAPYO", "B00IKM5LXG", "B003102JDM", "B003U6SJY0", "B001OQCV2E", "B0046YK4KW", "B001JIE7JC", "B005LAIGRS", "B00AEBBA4K", "B002UZCJ8Y", "B007UW9W5U", "B00005ALS0", "B0043X1FM2", "B000N4RAR4", "B000H6SXYM", "B00BTYOYG2", "B00006CXI1", "B0012EBV6A", "B000929UOQ", "B000B8QG22", "B00315462E", "B0007PALZ2", "B000QQLVPQ", "B0043X1FL8", "B0002V7OI8", "B002SYAGNC", "B0001US84Y", "B000CSUNQQ", "B0021L8V0M", "B005LAIILM", "B00003RQKO", "B00004STDN", "B000OT6V0K", "B0018O4YT0", "B000ARFPNK", "B000NQRR1Q", "B0002ZDVEU", "B004L3AR0K", "6304765258", "B0000B1OFL", "B000ARTN3I", "B008E70EES", "B000VWYJ86", "B005LAII3A", "B005LAIGLE", "B00BTYNXJG", "B00005KAQP", "B0007IO6NM", "B003Y5H54W"], "bought_together": ["B0000633R5", "B000BYA4IS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0792838467", "0792838408", "B00003CXPP", "B004HO6I4M"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 97674}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.43, "brand": "Echo Bridge Home Entertainment", "asin": "B000FDEVA2", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51uYC6ujr2L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Big White"}
{"description": "With its fantastic comedy seriesWeeds, cable network Showtime finally gave up its also-ran status to HBO and found itself with a controversial, buzz-worthy show that was as hilarious as it was dark, one about atrulydesperate housewife. A recent widow with two growing sons, Nancy Botwin (Golden Globe winner Mary-Louise Parker) looks like a typical resident of the affluent Southern California suburb of Agrestic. She keeps a clean, upscale house (with the help of a live-in maid), attends PTA meetings, goes to her kids' soccer games, makes frequent stops at the local coffee franchise.... and sells marijuana in order to make it all possible. Left with no way to support herself after her beloved husband's fatal heart attack, Nancy turns herself into the \"suburban baroness of bud,\" dealing to her neighbors in the area, with the help of her supplier Heylia (Tonye Patano) and point man Conrad (Romany Malco). Nancy's clients run from the local councilman (Kevin Nealon) to the just-barely-legal students at the local community college, but many in Agrestic are still in the dark as to how she keeps her family afloat, including her best friend, the sardonic Celia (Elizabeth Perkins), a wife and mother whose blistering, withering put-downs could make Dorothy Parker cringe in fear. But like many small-business owners, Nancy yearns for more success and cash, and like her workaholic neighbors, finds keeping a balance between work life and home life to be extremely precarious at best.WhileDesperate Housewivesyearned to be a suburban satire with bite,Weedswas the real deal, skewering upper-middle class mores with a sharp eye, a keen wit, and a mostly forgiving heart. In episode after episode, the show's creative team (led by creator Jenji Kohan) pulled back the layers of Agrestic's superficiality to show what lies beneath the squeaky-clean exteriors and smiling faces; it turns out that hunger, fear, desire, and, yes, desperation aren't that far down. However,Weedsforsakes pulpiness and florid drama for biting yet affectionate humor--its heroine is a woman with sliding morals, but one you'll root for to the very end. The effervescent Parker, the only actress who can mix perkiness with morbidity in just the right amounts, anchored the show with her amazing turn as Nancy, who by the end of the first season had become a kind of soccer-mom version of Michael Corleone, entering a corrupt world with both trepidation and fascination--and totally enamored of the power it brought her. Also perfectly cast, Perkins found the role of a lifetime as the bitterly hilarious Celia, and entering the show in its fourth episode, Justin Kirk (Parker's co-star inAngels in America) proved to be a potent secret weapon as Nancy's brother-in-law Andy, a slacker who wasn't above peddling t-shirts to elementary school kids. As icky as these characters might appear on the surface,Weedsmade them all immensely appealing and great company to be around. Don't say we didn't warn you: one hit and you'll be hooked on this show. The DVDs feature six episode commentaries with cast and crew, outtakes, original featurettes, a music video, and most enjoyably, Agrestic Herbal Recipes (for entertainment value only, we assume) and the \"Smoke and Mirrors\" marijuana mockumentary.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000Q6GUKW", "B00166UFSY", "B001AQBGM4", "B002AMVED8", "B003L77GTC", "B004YM6JSW", "B009TE9GNK", "B001OQCVFG", "B002ZCY8CC", "B002AMVEDI", "B003L77GS8", "B00HW3EXCE", "B001DJLCRC", "B000Q6GUW0", "B003L77GTM", "B009TE9HAW", "B0013ZGN9I", "B0032UYFA6", "B0029O0ANW", "B001RTSPVY", "B0015ABRE2", "B000V86OKG", "B0041KKZKA", "B002N5N5M0", "B00GWJIDFW", "B004YM6JUA", "B003L77GRO", "B0058YPG1G", "B005FISBTO", "B00EEDNR9A", "B002S913G6", "B00J5LXT44", "B0090XPH06", "B00079FUI6", "B00BUYWJEA", "B000Q6GUKC", "B0060MYKYY", "B00DXP7L88", "B009TE9GZI", "B000YABIQ6", "B0007QS324", "B00915G6WQ", "B001FB4W0W", "B003L77GPG", "B003R4ZMS6", "B000EXDS7K", "B000GH3CWK", "B005SEDI5M", "B0038M2APA", "B0092Q82LC", "B00511N7B2", "B001AQR39O", "B001AQBLBU", "B0009IW88K", "B0001KL5DA", "B005LAJ1JA", "B003FSTN7K", "B000A9QKRI", "B00003CXOP", "B0001O3YLM", "B0024FAR5M", "B007PTCP7K", "B00KPP6R9S", "B00005JNOG", "B0058YPO9A", "B00JVQ7PWU", "B0007R4SWM", "B00ELKDD9U", "B004HW7JNS", "B000FUTVLO", "B00BC5I6Q2", "B0002MPQRS", "B000RW3VDE", "B0018RKEQE", "B00280LZAE", "B00C1LIZMQ", "B0024F08RO", "B000FKO3GW", "B0009VBTP0", "B0018CWEYY", "B003UD7J6W", "B0002PYS7Y", "B002N5N5QQ", "B000F1IQI2", "B001GCUER0", "B000T9OP7G", "B009NH6AOQ", "B000WTVZI0", "B000N3T0EG", "B00K8HAKAK", "B000RO6JY0", "B0049P1VHS", "B009DA74O8", "B000FIMG4U", "B000E3L7F0", "B000P6YNTI", "B0024FAR4I", "B0032JTV6A", "B00ECGHM5O", "B0079IEPHA"], "bought_together": ["B000Q6GUKW", "B00166UFSY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00ELKDD9U", "B00HW3EXCE", "B004YM6JSW", "B003L77GTC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 9736}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 8.98, "brand": "Lions Gate", "asin": "B000FFJYE8", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Iy4dQgWzL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Weeds: Season 1"}
{"description": "Inspector Lewisis a very satisfying follow-up to the legacy ofInspector Morse, the late investigator (played by John Thaw, who died in 2002) beloved by many a fan of British television mysteries. Lewis (Kevin Whatley) was Morse's right-hand sergeant. Following the elder sleuth's death, Lewis was promoted but then faced the sudden and unexpected loss of his wife.Inspector Lewiscatches up with him upon his jet-lagged return from a two-year assignment in the British Virgin Islands. Destined to be put out to pasture as an instructor at detective school, Lewis instead gets caught up in a murder case that overlaps with an old, strangely yet apparently unresolved investigation by Morse. Joined by a new character, Detective Sergeant James Hathaway (Laurence Fox), Lewis looks into the murder of a brilliant American student at Oxford and her connection to the survivors of a racing legend killed, years before, under questionable circumstances. A coffee-stained, cryptic note in Morse's hand could provide a valuable clue, but fans of Morse holding any doubts about a possible new series built around Lewis will see this determined and hugely likable fellow come into his own. Lewis's emerging partnership with Hathaway is one of the real delights of this drama. The younger man, a former seminarian, and Lewis, who lost religious faith following his family tragedy, manage to find some ground for mutual respect and appreciation.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00JJRLFTU", "B0028LOT7O", "B007T40GOK", "B00C12ZISE", "B0019QOKRI", "B009DS5OEM", "B0051XIPYO", "B00C888LOO", "B002OMGVPU", "B00GHH9I62", "B0000WN12W", "B0056031OQ", "B002RB56YA", "B002T9FKZK", "B006X202AM", "B009DS6YGO", "B000O7860A", "B002CJI4WS", "B002VWZQFO", "B005K8QIS0", "B00D49YBTA", "B002F80SWA", "B009D4RW96", "B0056031NW", "B00287Z19I", "B005M2AKOW", "B001FBPSW8", "B009DS31ZG", "B002VWWLDY", "B00BVMXC4W", "B00BCXW106"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00DUX28XQ", "B00C12ZISE", "B007T40GOK", "B0019QOKRI"]}, "price": 59.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 106913}, "asin": "B000FNNHZC", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516BE0N1WWL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Mystery!: Inspector Lewis"}
{"description": "\"Let's get dangerous!\" Indeed, Disney's delightful Darkwing Duck, a masked mallard superhero, can get very dangerous--though the biggest danger he presents, typically, is to himself. Darkwing (DW to his friends) is the well-meaning if flamboyant (and klutzy) protector of St. Canard, a city that looks suspiciously like San Francisco and even has a Golden Gate-like bridge in which the winged avenger has tucked away his secret headquarters. A publicity-seeking ham, DW doesn't possess any superpowers, but has some nifty gadgets and the determination to meddle with nefarious plans of high-profile villains. Among them are the fascinating Bushroot, a disillusioned scientist who turns himself into a plant and has the power to make flora do his bidding; Quackerjack, a cackling, Joker-like evildoer; Megavolt, a whining dog who controls electricity; and the Liquidator, another pooch who is made of, well, water.DW fancies himself a lone wolf, so to speak, but unlike Batman, he doesn't have the knack for controlling every detail of his life. As a result, this would-be loner acquires a sidekick, a fawning pilot named Launchpad, and an adopted daughter, the headstrong Gosalyn, neither of whom he anticipated. All together they are a family of sorts, and DW needs them more than he cares to admit. This boxed set includes the series' two-part pilot and the first 25 episodes, including the very clever \"Hush, Hush Sweet Charlatan,\" in which DW mistakes a sci-fi movie production on St. Canard's streets for a real alien invasion, and \"Duck Blind,\" in which the temporarily sightless hero refuses to let a loss of vision stand in the way of his derring-do.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000Q6775E", "B000FS9MVA", "B000AXWGRM", "B000AXWGRC", "B000V1Y44Q", "B000HWZ4R0", "B000HWZ4RA", "B000V1Y450", "B0002W4SY0", "B00DQFMHPC", "B000CDGVNA", "B000ATQYVA", "B000CDGVNK", "B00COSX8DM", "B000G26YAW", "B001PU8N26", "B00198X0YA", "B00AQ590IC", "B0001FVDG4", "B00H9FDD2Q", "B00COT74RW", "B00316DA9I", "B00LBHOCHS", "B001N6FPQY", "B005EKWZD6", "B0007NFMCG", "B006TSI7D4", "B009H3LNF2", "B004H0M2ZU", "B0042I6528", "B000BQ7J9I", "B0052MXJ3Q", "B004HI79LO", "B000FA57HG", "B000HWZ4DY", "B005OZJVE2", "B001QVGLFU", "B000FA57H6", "B008QE9UWG", "B00C7E3E7S", "B0017INRG8", "B00BCMT1PK", "B006WNSHUY", "B000XXWKFW", "B007QD0VOE", "B002DQL34G", "B009ZNA918", "B000OY9V7K", "1608865762", "B0009IW8AI", "B0052MXIYG", "B001BN25VW", "B000OY9V7A", "B00F3L8OQS", "B00EQ30Q8S", "B001R1HEMI", "B004VT9JLC", "B00CYI4L9W", "B008IELRUM", "B007J3ISIM", "B000O179IG", "B00AQ590KU", "B006WZIF7W", "B000G1R39Y", "B00961ENYI", "B00I2YXN5A", "B000HC2LRG", "B004DTU2X4", "B00B1Z6MB4", "B006UKX5QK", "B00006IGVK", "B001QIVEVE", "B00023E894", "B005BUA1CQ", "B009JE18UE", "B000AOEMUA", "B001PU8N12", "B003Q7B7A6", "B002ZXZJ1A", "B00BCRRA8U", "B00I099JZK", "B005G5NPWY", "B0029WGIDK", "B00L326LTI", "B00E1QLEJA", "B0002NY8XA", "B000HWZ4DO", "B001JRYH1Q", "B002DH20Q0", "B000MQ4WNI", "B006WDWBK6", "B001OD8E2I", "B004ZKKL14", "B00AIANIPQ", "B001I2EQSG", "B001I2EQT0", "B001I2EQS6", "B004RA7XZE", "B000M8N41W"], "bought_together": ["B000Q6775E"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000AXWGRC", "B000FS9MVA", "B000AXWGRM", "B000HWZ4R0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 6813}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 15.49, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B000FS9MUQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51TchYZOkxL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Darkwing Duck, Volume 1"}

Director William Malone's (Feardotcom, The House on Haunted Hill) choice to cast the outcast teen, Tara (Lindsay Pulsipher), as a cute blond girl more suited toThe O.C.than to horror, spoils an initial opportunity to convince the viewer of her suffering. Weak acting is the biggest detriment, however. As Tara is kidnapped and thrown into a psychotic couple's basement as a sacrifice to the Devil to bring their dead son, Johnny (Jesse Haddock), back to life, Tara's fear fails to translate into real dread. Black-and-white flashbacks of the sick married couple watching helplessly as their son drowns are equally corny. Johnny, the child zombie haunted by guilt he feels for living at the expense of others, especially Tara's, is the only interesting character. The fact that he is mute, communicating by scribbling thoughts into dirt, makes him eerily prophetic. As a character, Johnny terrifies more than the stop-motion demon who steals teens away to the netherworld. LikeHouse of Whipcord, this story of a basement-turned-torture chamber has appeal for its archetypal plot concept, butThe Fair Hair Childlacks actors who convey real angst.--Trinie Dalton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000FS2W3A", "B000GI3RHY", "B000FA57W6", "B002LMSWN2", "B000KJTFBG", "B000NY0YJA", "B000GB5M2O", "B000KJTFB6", "B000WC38FU", "B000F3UACK", "B000RIWAV2", "B000S1MMCK", "B000UR9QXK", "B000E5KUME", "B000UYX4P4", "B001EN5I4U", "B000E5KUMO", "B000LPS47K", "B004JHYTHK", "B000S1MMCU", "B000RL21PO", "B000FS2W3K", "B001KKU9CI", "B000FA57WG", "B000OYCMO4", "B000GB5MOW", "B000RL21OK", "B001B8XRT6", "B001L9EXUC", "B0052DP1RC", "B001AR0D40", "B001AIQ14A", "B00B8O4WQA", "B005BYBZR2", "B00D9EJFZA", "B001CFEC2O", "B000FS2W1W", "B003THSXJ6", "B005LAIGOQ", "B00BEIYG98", "B0024FAG2G", "B000PWQP9I", "B0021L8UXA", "B00AJLHUA8", "B000FFJZO2", "B000ERVKLW", "B004LWZW24", "B008JFUO36", "B000F3UACU", "B005CFC02E", "B00015HWXW", "B0032EFQRS", "B0009RQRQU", "B001139ZE2", "B006W4KVIO", "B0007Z0OA4", "B0000D0YVO", "B0052Y0FDQ", "B000096IAF", "6305759650", "B001D262KG", "B0016MJ6KG", "B001D5C1NA", "B0071HPOY2"], "bought_together": ["B000FS2W3A", "B000GI3RHY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000FS2W3A", "B000RIWAV2", "B000F3UACK", "B000FS2W3K"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 204149}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 7.5, "brand": "STARZ/SPHE", "asin": "B000GB5M2Y", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515w59IW0DL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Masters of Horror: Fair Haired Child"}

{"description": "With its combination of Cold War villains and James Bond-like techno-gadgets,Mission: Impossiblewas an instant hit when it premiered on September 17, 1966. Airing Saturday nights at 9:00 on CBS, the series was the brainchild of creator/producer Bruce Geller, whose formula for seven successful seasons included a well-chosen ensemble cast, noteworthy guest stars, and a flexible premise that inspired clever plots twists and a constant variety of \"international\" locations (mostly filmed on a studio backlot). This seven-disc set includes all 28 episodes of season 1, the only season to feature Steven Hill as Dan Briggs, leader of the top-secret counterintelligence team known as Impossible Missions Force (IMF). As the no-nonsense Briggs, Hill (better known for his later role onLaw & Orderfrom 1990 to 2000) began each episode by sneakily retrieving the dossier and recorded instructions (voiced throughout the entire series by uncredited actor Bob Johnson) for the IMF's latest assignment. \"Your mission, should you decide to accept it\" and \"this recording will self-destruct in five seconds\" quickly became pop-cultural catch-phrases, as Briggs routinely selected his preferred teammates based on their mastery of practical skills. With \"special appearance\" billing forM:I's first three seasons, Martin Landau played master-of-disguise Rollin Hand; his off-screen wife, Barbara Bain, played top-model and undercover seductress Cinnamon Carter; Greg Morris brought hip coolness (and racial diversity) to his role as electronics expert Barney Collier; and Peter Lupus played handsome hunk Willy Armitage, adding IMF muscle to Briggs' brainy strategies.As a Desilu production based at Paramount Studios,Mission: Impossibleshared guest stars, production personnel, locations, and even occasional sets with the originalStar Trek. Fans of both shows will enjoy spotting these crossover details (including George Takei's appearance in \"The Carriers,\" a first-season highlight), and this season's other stand-out episodes include the \"Pilot\" (featuring Wally Cox as an ace safe-cracker), \"Operation Rogosh,\" \"A Spool There Was,\" \"Action!,\" \"The Train,\" and \"The Traitor.\" Whether they were toppling dictators, rescuing doomed prisoners, foiling despots, or framing Mafia kingpins, the IMF agents were consistently blessed with taut, well-written plots, many unfolding with minimal dialogue and highly visual schemes that demanded (and rewarded) the viewer's close attention. Although Steven Hill eventually left the series (as an Orthodox Jew, he preferred not to work on the Jewish Sabbath, asM:Irequired), his single season set the stage forM:I's long-term popularity, with Peter Graves (replacing Hill as \"Jim Phelps\") leading the IMF from 1967 to 1973. And while Paramount has again neglected to offer DVD extras with this set, the episodes look and sound just about perfect, with a parade of guest stars including Carol O'Connor, Simon Oakland, Fritz Weaver, Nehemiah Persoff, Barbara Luna, Vic Tayback, and a host of other '60s TV regulars. Your mission--and you shouldn't hesitate to accept it--is to enjoy this classic series all over again!--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000NOIX66", "B000UX6TJI", "B0012Z36FI", "B001BN4WI6", "B001S86IZE", "B002L9N4E2", "B000LE16VC", "B0012EBV8I", "B006IRQUNA", "B000ERVJKO", "B0012EBV88", "B000PGTPC8", "B000WQWPSM", "B001DHXT7U", "B0014FAIXE", "B0014FAIVG", "B005MQ5840", "B000BGR1B4", "B00E5G03I4", "B001S86IYK", "B008I34Y3K", "B001CQONOA", "B000BZISS0", "B000LE16Y4", "B002JIOOAS", "B00008YLVB", "B000RZIGSQ", "B00005JO3P", "B00005JMHI", "B0030Y12BO", "B0002COTDA", "B000Z6GT1I", "B000EQ46H8", "B0007KIFK0", "B004PQM81E", "B00005JNS8", "B000MGBSQM", "B000BF0C7A", "B006IRQU2G", "B0009UC80Q", "B0087GKHXO", "B000UX6TKC", "B001FT4PEW", "B000Q6GUSE", "B00JZYJ7F6", "B001666484", "B005LFQRTC", "B000MGBSQC", "B000PHX5KU", "B000LV6VZQ", "B002DH20PQ", "B00008EY6N", "B000BOH8Z0", "B000BF0C8E", "B002XKKX8E", "B000UAE7VS", "B000IHYXJO", "B00BNAE30O", "B002LCOHPE", "B00005JLEY", "B000EXDS2A", "B00018D3RI", "B0009UC80G", "B007AAF3FK", "B000CCBCD0", "B00005JNHT", "B00KTZALDC", "B00B2BYY4O", "B00096S45S", "B000UAE7DQ", "B0028RABR0", "B0007CNY4K", "B00B00HUC0", "B001UDPA9C", "B000CELOV8", "B00471JT0K", "B000MQ4WNS", "B000F48D0U", "B000VS6R30", "B009OE2ODY", "B00D9EJFQY", "B00HZMZ286", "B00BDZV4OW", "B001N26GSE", "B003KSO3R0", "B008OR5X6M", "B001675ZJ2", "B000ERVJMC", "B001JAHPMG", "B0009NZ36O", "B000EQ46HI", "B001CQONQ8", "B000N6UF10", "B0000WN0ZU", "B00962R0H4", "B00006J6XH", "B005NHZAXM", "B000EHSVB4", "B00553K9NA", "B000LXGXY8"], "bought_together": ["B000NOIX66", "B000UX6TJI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000NOIX66", "B000UX6TJI", "B0012Z36FI", "B009DA74CK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 29827}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 12.99, "brand": "Paramount", "asin": "B000HWZ4HU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51JZX9ZS5RL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Mission: Impossible - The Complete First TV Season"}
{"description": "Matt Dillon lumbers throughFactotumlike a side of beef just starting to rot, lifting his chin in quiet, semi-comic reflections on the domestic squalor of a booze-ridden life. His slow, thick performance--as if he had something more viscous than blood running through his veins--has a weary gravitas that veers from wry resignation to bursts of violence that he regrets even as he's committing them. As Henry Chinaski (an alter ego of author Charles Bukowski), Dillon idly skips from job to job, seeking one that will allow him to continue his two pursuits: Writing and drinking. He gets enmeshed with one woman (Lili Taylor,I Shot Andy Warhol) and dallies with another (Marisa Tomei,In the Bedroom), but his only true love is the bottle. Despite this bleak storyline,Factotumproceeds with an almost lighthearted pace, each spare scene delivered with a dry, almost wistful tone of regret and flashes of gallows humor.

{"description": "This clever, funny big-screen adaptation of Lauren Weisberger's best-seller takes some of the snarky bite out of the chick lit book, but smoothes out the characters' boxy edges to make a more satisfying movie. There's no doubtThe Devil Wears Prada belongs to Meryl Streep, who turns in an Oscar&#65533;-worthy (seriously!) strut as the monster editor-in-chief ofRunway, an elite fashion magazine full of size-0, impossibly well-dressed plebes. This makes new second-assistant Andrea (Anne Hathaway), who's smart but an unacceptable size 6, stick out like a sore thumb. Streep has a ball sending her new slave on any whimsical errand, whether it's finding the seventh (unpublished) Harry Potter book or knowing what type she means when she wants \"skirts.\" Though Andrea thumbs her nose at the shallow world of fashion (she's only doing the job to open doors to a position atThe New Yorker someday), she finds herself dually disgusted yet seduced by the perks of the fast life. The film sends a basic message: Make work your priority, and you'll be rich and powerful... and lonely. Any other actress would have turned Miranda into a scenery-chewing Cruella, but Streep's underplayed, brilliant comic timing make her a fascinating, unapologetic character. Adding frills to the movie's fun are Stanley Tucci as Streep's second-in-command, Emily Blunt (My Summer of Love) as the overworked first assistant, Simon Baker as a sexy writer, and breathtaking couture designs any reader ofVogue would salivate over. --Ellen A.

{"description": "Sweet baby Jesus, we thank you for blessing Will Ferrell and Adam McKay with the talent to create a NASCAR comedy as hilarious asTalladega Nights. The so-called \"Ballad of Ricky Bobby\" is hardly flawless  in fact it's not always firing on all cylinders  but with comedy star Ferrell and director McKay still hot from the success of their previous comedy hitAnchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy, most of this 108-minute spoof of oval-track racing is so knee-slappin' funny that you can't help but surrender to the stupidity.Obviously, Ferrell's the shining star, and his portrayal of lead-footed pit-crew-member-turned-#1 NASCAR champion Ricky \"I Wanna Go Fast\" Bobby (how can you not love that name?) is spot-on perfect, righteously spoofing the entirety of NASCAR culture without insulting its oft-ridiculed roots in redneck bootlegging of a bygone era. You could even argue that Talladega Nights is truer to NASCAR than Tom Cruise'sDays of Thunder, and it's certainly more entertaining, especially when you add John C.

{"description": "The moving biblical tale of Esther--a humble Jewish girl who saved her people from annihilation and won the heart of the handsome Persian king Xerxes--is the subject ofOne Night with the King, a lush ode to one of the Old Testament's most inspiring women. Esther, played with spark and confidence by Tiffany Dupont, could perhaps be said to be the first career woman to \"have it all\"--while also serving her people, and God. The film, shot on location in India, has the feel of the great epics of the '60s--a sensation underscored by the appearance, in small but pivotal roles, of both Omar Sharif and Peter O'Toole. (EvenRaiders of the Lost Ark's John Rhys-Davies--\"Bad dates!\"--echoes earlier desert adventures.) But the film belongs to the willful Esther, who navigates among war, bloodlust, persecution, and terror with the strength of knowing she's serving the Lord, and her people. If the film has a few anachronisms--including the young Esther's suitor, who has blonde streaks and a surfer-dude delivery (\"The market was rilly busy today\")--its heart and its focus never waver. Fans of biblical tales and well-made drama for the entire family shouldn't miss it.--A.T.

{"description": "Saturday Night Live: The Complete First Season boxed set is much more than the sum of its parts, in fact it's one of the most significant TV DVD releases yet. This isn't just an 8-disc set featuring 24 episodes of live sketch comedy, it's a big box of zeitgeist. This really is the complete first season, mostly uncut and complete with every musical act and short film intact (a few bumpers and transitions were removed to make it flow better on DVD). The first broadcast aired on October 11, 1975, hosted by George Carlin and featured musical guests Billy Preston and Janis Ian. At first, things seem a little raw: Carlin's opening monologue is painfully unfunny, Chase's first shot at the seminal \"Weekend Update\" is amusing but sloppy, and much of the cast seem to be holding back. But the groundwork is all there, and soon in subsequent episodes you can see it all start to come together (especially with John Belushi who lets his simmering intensity out to tremendous effect), proving that the first episode simply belies the historic impact the show would come to have on popular culture. Here you'll find the first airing of some of the many skits that stayed famous over the years: the Land Shark, Samurai Hotel, Chevy Chase's opening pratfalls and the impersonations of Gerald Ford which would spin off into the proud SNL tradition of presidential parodies.The set is a very entertaining look at a significant point in TV and American cultural history. It is so 1975, but that's a major part of its appeal: did Chevy Chase really used to look that young? Did a young George Carlin really used to look so old? Check out Abba in those disco jumpsuits. And if you're a fan of The Muppets, seeing them here on late-night TV making jokes about getting drunk will blow your mind. Younger fans may not fully understand just how groundbreaking this show was at the time. For example, Richard Pryor hosting the seventh episode, which includes the famous \"Word Association\" sketch. Back then, to have a comedian of Pryor's reputation joking about drugs, sex, and race on live TV was a tremendous risk (it's also gratifying to see the obvious effect he had on the next generation of comics like Eddie Murphy and Chris Rock), and it helped established the show's cache as unpredictable and edgy. The DVD set is full of moments like this and, like the show itself, it has its ups and downs. Watching hosts like Rob Reiner (back when he was still in his \"Meathead\" days from All in the Family), Madeleine Kahn, and Desi Arnaz work their comedy chops with the cast are high points. Whereas the infamous Louise Lasser episode, which is known for being among the worst episodes in the show's history&#x85; not so much. Still, it's entirely to Executive Producer Lorne Michaels's credit that it's included here. It's a tremendous collection of everything that gave birth to Saturday Night Live, and the seed of what SNL would become, spawning many movies (not to mention a few catch-phrases), launching the careers of many great comedians, and providing TV viewers with some of the most famous, and infamous, moments in broadcast history. And it all started right here.The set is packaged in a well-designed, sleek fold-out digi-pack with every episode listed on the sleeves, with hosts, musical guests, and the original air date. The special features include a rare look at the cast members' original screen tests, and a 1975 TV interview with the cast. --Daniel Vancini", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000VNMMVG", "B0013LRKQC", "B001FFBI9G", "B002MXG570", "B000A6T22Q", "B000A6T22G", "B000LXGXXE", "B000A6T230", "B000ZOXDFU", "B00014NE9E", "B00014K5CI", "B000A6T23A", "B0041QSZGA", "B0000C2IUC", "B0000C2IUO", "B00014NEAI", "B0002I84FI", "B00LERXH9Y", "B0006FFRSE", "B000EPFDDK", "B007X1K450", "B00014K5BO", "B0000C2IQW", "B0002I84EE", "0316735655", "B003LXM1QE", "B003VE5E6W", "B000F0UUL4", "B000CCD0GM", "B0000A1HQC", "B0001S6AQE", "6302983193", "B0000A1HPO", "B002NALPLS", "B000EPFDDU", "B004CJB0CC", "B0009A408E", "1590710487", "B000068WS7", "B001LMAK6K", "B00103589Y", "B00079Z9R8", "B0000A1HPQ", "B0009UC810", "B0009ML24W", "B0033PSH8G", "B000H5U6HK", "B0000TPA60", "B00361XWEQ", "B00014NE9Y", "B003CNQPME", "B0000A02TZ", "B0002S94X4", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B003Q5ONQ8", "B000BF0C8E", "B0055OG2BC", "0316781460", "B0089BSMWA", "B000F7CMRM", "B000G0O5EG", "B003Y7F1PU", "B000803BPS", "B000BGR1B4", "B0001BKAP8", "B0009A407U", "B004T4O73O", "0253010829", "B00JHH1VUU", "B00008EY6N", "B00261E0T8", "B000XJD3K2", "B0085Z6Z2O", "B00HZMZ286", "B003H8F2VO", "B000FL7CBE", "B000Q7ZOAI", "B003CRM6PA", "1439148864", "B0002NY81C", "B0009UC80G", "B000LXGXY8", "B002PQ7JR4", "B0002KPHVU", "B00441GZ14", "B00BBXSPCK", "B001JFKWE4", "B00BBXSPES", "B000N2HD6O", "0836220625", "6305869103", "B0047HXMNE", "B002UJIY2U", "B000K7VHYG", "B001CRRADU", "B004CJB0AO", "B0019HQICW", "B00HRUQB5O", "B006363QHE", "B000BOH8YQ"], "bought_together": ["B0013LRKQC", "B000VNMMVG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0013LRKQC", "B0041QSZGA", "B0006FFRSE", "B001FFBI9G"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 14411}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 16.95, "brand": "UNIVERSAL", "asin": "B000JLQPYK", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41KpDaBKt8L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Saturday Night Live: Season 1, 1975-1976"}

{"description": "First screened in Europe and scheduled for limited release in the U.S.,The Illusionistoffers welcome proof that \"arthouse\" quality needn't be limited to the arthouses. Set in turn-of-the-century Vienna, this stately, elegant period film benefited from a crossover release in mainstream cinemas, and showed considerable box-office staying power--granted, teenage mallrats and lusty males may have been drawn to the allure ofSeventh Heavenalumna Jessica Biel, who rises to the occasion with a fine performance. But there's equal appeal in the casting of Edward Norton and Paul Giamatti, who bring their formidable talents to bear on the intriguing tale of a celebrated magician named Eisenheim (Norton) whose stage performance offends the Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell), a vindictive lout who aims to marry Duchess Sophie (Biel), Eisenheim's childhood friend and now, 15 years later, his would-be lover. This romantic rivalry and Eisenheim's increasingly enigmatic craft of illusion are investigated by Chief Inspector Uhl (Giamatti), who's under Leopold's command and is therefore not to be trusted as Eisenheim and Sophie draw closer to their inevitable reunion. Cleverly adapted by director Neil Burger from Steven Millhauser's short story \"Eisenheim the Illusionist,\" and boasting exquisite production values and a fine score by Philip Glass,The Illusionistis the kind of class act that fully deserved its unusually wide and appreciative audience. --Jeff ShannonBeyondThe Illusionist\"Eisenheim the Illusionist\" and Other StoriesPaul Giamatti in a More Loveable RoleMagic Kits & AccessoriesStills fromThe Illusionist", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000LC55F2", "B000NOIX48", "B002ZG980U", "B002WNU0QW", "B00DWZHTOU", "B001MZ5W3M", "B00011CZRE", "B000H0MKI8", "B00008K7AO", "B000L212HC", "B00AEBB8NI", "B000GFLKF8", "B000O76ZO4", "B00003CXZ4", "B00005JLSB", "B000FKO5QK", "B000M341QE", "B00AEFXGIY", "B00005V9HH", "B00AEBB8LA", "B00005JMOW", "B00096S49Y", "0767847415", "6305313687", "B004SIP9Z6", "B0047T74CM", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B000R4SMCW", "B0002YLCG0", "B000P0J0EW", "B000HEWEE4", "B0041KKYHE", "B00BBI7EZY", "B00AEBBA2W", "B000CQLZ0Q", "0783235070", "0767802519", "B002ZG997C", "B00003CXHG", "B004SIP7ZS", "B000069HZP", "B004SIP7PS", "B003ASLJQI", "B00177Y9ZC", "B00005JLKN", "B003ZW9H68", "B001N44BVQ", "B002O3Z50Q", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00005JN2Z", "B00AEBB86A", "B00000F4ZY", "B000MZHW40", "0671686402", "B00BB67UNW", "B005HP2J0M", "B000QXDED6", "B000NIVJF4", "B001F12J0C", "B000N6TX1I", "B000LAZE8C", "B00080ZG10", "B005LAIGRS", "B0009MDPYM", "0792159659", "B000OYC7BW", "B001UV4XGU", "B004AOECXI", "0767818105", "B000XR9L50", "B0018O4YT0", "B00015YVDG", "B004SIP8JI", "B00004XPPG", "B00006ZXSK", "B001DHXT20", "B0000AC8LR", "B009B8YMB0", "0783229402", "B0006210ZG", "B001PPGAIA", "B00004BZIY", "B008JFURII", "B00005JPAR", "B00006ADFM", "B004SIP7TE", "B000F5GNX8", "B000FS9FCG", "B006P0FIGU", "B00005JMCN", "B002VWNID6", "B004XQO90O", "B004EPZ084", "B00AEBB9M8", "B000P5FH3K", "B00005JNY3", "B000063US3", "B003L20IG0"], "bought_together": ["B000LC55F2", "B002ZG980U"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000LC55F2", "B005LAIHXQ", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00DV2MVWO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 60145}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.0, "brand": "Twentieth Century Fox", "asin": "B000K7VHPU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51nYghoS63L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Illusionist (Full Screen Edition)"}

{"description": "A film adaptation of Dito Montiel's memoir of the same name,A Guide to Recognizing Your Saintsis a compelling, thoughtful movie based on Montiel's childhood growing up in 1980s Queens. A writer and director who understands his limitations, Montiel wisely left the acting to the pros. Shia LaBeouf (Holes) plays him during his adolescence, while Robert Downey Jr. (Good Night, and Good Luck,Wonder Boys) portrays the grown-up Dito. Never mind that there is absolutely no physical resemblance between the two actors; LaBeouf and Downey are so convincing in their roles it doesn't matter. Switching effortlessly from present day (where Dito is a successful author) to the past (where he is a tough little kid trying to figure out if there is life beyond New York),A Guide to Recognizing Your Saintstackles Dito's complicated relationship with his parents (Chazz Palminteri and Dianne Wiest), as well as the friends he left behind. Eric Roberts is magnificent in a small role as one of Dito's tough, childhood buddies. His powerful performance makes viewers remember there was a time when Roberts was better known for his acting skills than for being Julia's big brother.

{"description": "Annette Bening is the stand-out highlight in this dysfunctional \"family\" comedy based on the bestselling memoir by Augusten Burroughs. Although fans of the book may be slightly disappointed with the film's uneven and somewhat campy rendition of Burroughs' twisted adolescence in the 1970s, there's plenty of pleasure to be found in the work of an excellent cast led by Bening, who gives a subtle dare-to-hate-me performance as Burroughs' mother Diedre, a would-be poet who's so aloof about her teenage son Augusten (played by fresh-faced newcomer Joseph Cross, fromFlags of Our Fathers) that she allows him to be legally adopted into the eccentric family of her psychiatrist, Dr. Finch (Brian Cox). As the half-crazed Finch overmedicates Diedre into a haze of semi-conscious madness, he also turns Augusten's life upside down while his wife (Jill Clayburgh) and daughters (Gwyneth Paltrow, Evan Rachel Wood) indulge their own eccentricities and Augusten enters into an intimate relationship with one of Finch's adopted patients (played by Joseph Fiennes).As adapted and directed by Nip/Tuck creator Ryan Murphy,Running with Scissorslacks the singular voice of Burroughs' dryly comedic first-person narrative, but even as the film struggles to find a consistent tone, it's so full of wacky behavior that you can't help laughing. It's a messy, patchwork quilt of a movie, blessed by authentically garish '70s production design and a soundtrack of familiar '70s hits. In rendering Burroughs' indelible portrait of weak, irresponsible adults and the people they victimize, Murphy and his well-chosen cast (which also includes Alec Baldwin as Diedre's ex-husband) find moments of touching pathos amidst the madness. For her part, Bening delivers an acclaimed performance that gives the film a dramatic weight it otherwise lacks. The rest is for anyone who enjoys a laugh at the freak-show expense of damaged and damaging characters. --Jeff ShannonStills fromRunning with Scissors(click for larger image)MoreRunning with Scissorson Amazon.comThe BookMore Films staring Annette BeningMore Films about Eccentric Families", "related": {"also_bought": ["031242227X", "125003440X", "031242681X", "0312428278", "0312422288", "0312315953", "0312341911", "0312272057", "B00003CWQR", "0312563558", "B0034G4OZE", "B001TK2BMK", "1250032105", "B000CS464G", "B006G7YSP4", "B000087F7E", "0312315945", "B000JBWWQA", "B000KX0IOK", "B00AEFXESQ", "140006869X", "B00007JXWX", "B00AFEY354", "B00013RC2K", "B0000640VJ", "B00005JMJG", "0312283709", "1427200718", "B00175VSBC", "B0000AC8LR", "B0016MJ6T2", "B00AEFYSWM", "B000EHQU0S", "0307395987", "B00049QQHI", "0312315961", "B002VECLVO", "B004SEUIZG", "6305784817", "B00005Q4CS", "B0007PALGG", "B0006TPE4C", "B00008DP4C", "B00005JLSB", "B00001PE4D", "B00005JLHW", "B000FVQLQQ", "B003L20ICE", "B000N3SU92", "B00004UEDQ", "B0007G89FK", "B000MEYKD2", "B001JIE7JC", "B004FQX5B6", "B0014D5RBE", "B00070EBOY", "B00003CWTI", "B007HRKBI0", "0307396185", "B0057ZAA6W", "B005PTMPYA", "B0041KKYEM", "B00ADRYCWC", "0312938853", "B000F6II1M", "B0001DMVBC", "B0053XZ8O2", "B00008972P", "B0001EFUFK", "B0014GI6I2", "B00DW5IKYS", "B000E33VWW", "B0058ZPNOK", "B006QVRVJK", "B0036TGT8Y", "B00FXWAZW8", "B000QGDY0G", "B004H83IG4", "B005C7SXMS", "B000A7DVR2", "B0016LFG4C", "0800177789", "B002LMV7RA", "B00004TWZH", "B00CC2V7AQ", "B005DI8X3K", "B00EYPJHDI", "B00AEBB9CS", "B00AEFY8MM", "B000H9I1OG", "0316777730", "B00005JLQH", "B000092T3P", "B0043X1FL8", "B0010X8NF0", "B004499LX0", "B00AEFXUXU", "B008N25X7M", "B002DP0J24", "B0007UC8Y4"], "bought_together": ["031242227X", "125003440X"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002HJ3KD6", "125003440X", "1250032105", "B000GQLCQY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 56416}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.5, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B000M5B98A", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51xHRfPC6cL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Running With Scissors"}
