{"description": "You can take this 1992 thriller one of two ways: it's either a highly suspenseful movie about an unfortunate young woman's psychological breakdown, or it's a glossy slasher movie starring two of Hollywood's best young actresses. Or maybe it's both at the same time--or perhaps it's the clever and well-acted thriller for its first hour before resorting to the routine shocks of a cheap horror flick. However you look at it, there's no denying that this is a dynamite showcase for Jennifer Jason Leigh as the roommate from hell who becomes the bane of Bridget Fonda's existence. First she picks up Fonda's mannerisms, then starts to borrow her wardrobe, cuts her hair to resemble Fonda's, and even \"borrows\" her roomie's boyfriend for a deceitful night of lovemaking. By that point Fonda's totally freaking out (wouldn't you?), and, well, that's when the whole thing gets a little too silly. Still, this is a nifty little shocker, and director Barbet Schroeder brings more intelligence and style to the material than it really deserves. Add that to the fine performances by the battling roommates and you've got a movie that will make you think twice before inviting total strangers to live with you.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305213305", "B000ASDFJ0", "B002GHHHJC", "B00AEFXX9Q", "B00004RF85", "B00013RC7K", "B00009WVSL", "B00002E23C", "B002ZG99IG", "0790730979", "B002AT8KAG", "B00005Y1UV", "B00L6AW1K0", "0792846443", "6305308837", "B00008L3S6", "0767815718", "B00AEFXKZ8", "B00006HAWN", "B001O7JHV6", "B00005Y1UX", "B002NZK5RI", "630523650X", "6305161933", "B000E5N684", "B00AEBBA2W", "B000U1ZV76", "B000083C6I", "B00AEFXT1S", "B0043X1FNQ", "B000H5TH1Q", "B00006RCNY", "B0002IQLHQ", "B000EQ5SRK", "B000TSIJWY", "B000CEV3M8", "6305310335", "B00005K3NU", "B00000J11D", "B000BYY11Y", "B00124ONGA", "B00AEFYNG8", "B00803PG44", "B002AMVEII", "B00K31RBYY", "B00K1L4NBU", "0767809726", "B00AEFYC96", "0780627776", "0783230389", "B0045HCJ8K", "B0088EDMVY", "B000A2UBN4", "B0002DB54A", "B0021L8UPS", "B00AEFXBPM", "B00015YVDG", "B0010HOZW6", "B002O3Z4WK", "0767810856", "0792838068", "B00008CMRK", "B0009X768W", "B0037QGS0A", "B00004Y87P", "B00003CWQR", "B00026ZD04", "B00005K3NR", "B00007BKVC", "B0000AZT7A", "B000TUDBFW", "B00029RT9E", "B00005JKQS", "B000I2J736", "B0002KPIQY", "B00007AJE1", "B0021L8UYY", "B000MM0LIM", "B000HT38EO", "0767812158", "B000E5KURY", "B002NZK5R8", "B000FS9UKI", "B00005K3O0", "B001EKP5D2", "B00005RYKU", "B00GNAO70K", "B0045HCIYA", "B0053TWVSC", "1558908390", "B0045HCJ8A", "B0000VV55I", "0800177789", "B00006FDCU", "B00AEBBA4K", "B00006L92K", "B00005U14H", "6305428409", "B00006L92S"], "bought_together": ["6305213305", "B00AEFXX9Q"], "buy_after_viewing": ["6305213305", "B002GHHHJC", "B00AEFXX9Q", "B00009WVSL"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 21437}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 22.97, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "0767802616", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51G0AWC6VTL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Single White Female"}

{"description": "Based on a memoir by former undercover cop Joe Pistone (whose daring and unprecedented infiltration of the New York Mob scene earned him a place in the federal witness protection program),Donnie Brascois like a de- romanticized, de-mythologized version ofThe Godfather. It offers an uncommonly detailed, privileged glimpse inside the world of organized crime from the perspective of the little guys at the bottom of Mafia hierarchy rather than from the kingpins at the top.Donnie Brascois not only one of the great modern-day gangster movies to put in the company ofThe Godfatherfilms andGoodFellas, but it is also one of the great undercover police movies--arguably surpassingSerpicoandPrince of the Cityin richness of character, detail, and moral complexity. Donnie (Johnny Depp, a splendid actor) is practically adopted by Lefty Ruggiero (Al Pacino), a gregarious, low-level &quot;made&quot; man who grows to love his young prot&eacute;g&eacute; like a son. (Pacino really sinks into this guy's skin and polyester slacks, and creates his freshest, most fully realized character since his 1970s heyday.) As Donnie acclimates himself to Lefty's world, he distances himself from his wife (a terrific Anne Heche) and family for their own protection. Almost imperceptibly his sense of identity slips away from him. Questioning his own confused loyalties, unable to trust anybody else because he himself is an imposter, Donnie loses his way in a murky and treacherous no-man's land.

{"description": "One of the best romantic comedies of the 1990s,My Best Friend's Weddingnot only gave Julia Roberts a delightful vehicle for her crowd-pleasing comeback, but it further distinguished itself by avoiding the conventional plotting of the genre. Julia plays a prominent Chicago restaurant critic whose best friend (Dermot Mulroney) is a former lover from her college days with whom she'd made a binding pact: if neither of them were married by the age of 28, they'd marry each other. Just when they're about to reach the deadline of their agreement, Mulroney arrives in Chicago to introduce Roberts to his seemingly perfect fianc&eacute;e (Cameron Diaz) and announce their wedding in just three days. That leaves the shocked Julia with just three short days to sabotage the wedding and marry the man she now realizes she's loved all along. With potential heartbreak waiting in the wings, she'll either get what she wants or pay the price for her selfish behavior, and Ronald Bass's cleverly constructed screenplay keeps us guessing to the very end. Rupert Everett scored rave reviews for his scene-stealing performance as Robert's gay friend who goes along with her scheming (but only so far), and even as she makes her character's needy desperation disarmingly appealing, Roberts wisely allows Diaz to capitalize on her charming time in the spotlight. As the romantic outcome remains uncertain, the viewer is held in a state of giddy suspense, and director P.J. Hogan pulls off some hilarious scenes (like a restaurant full of people singing the Dionne Warwick hit \"I Say a Little Prayer\") that could easily have fallen flat in the hands of a less talented filmmaker. It's no surprise that this was one of the box-office smashes of 1997.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEBB8NS", "B00003CXSM", "B0009OL7Z4", "B00081U7HC", "B000023VTP", "B00386EZKE", "0767821769", "B0045HCJJ4", "B0015I2RT8", "B00006FMUW", "B001TUZD8O", "B0007RT9M6", "B000ELJAEM", "6304765266", "B00003CXFV", "B000CCBCAS", "B00466HN7M", "B001AKTZW8", "B0000AOV4I", "B000YDBPAM", "B0000DIXDR", "B002K0WBXW", "B000BKVQS4", "B00009WVSL", "B000A343RI", "B00AEBB8YW", "B00AEBB9WI", "B00AEFY4CG", "B00AEFY99O", "B000XT1P3E", "B001ECDVK4", "B00004TJKK", "B004SIP9RO", "B00006ZXSO", "B000053VB4", "B000MQC9H4", "B00006ZXSN", "B00007E2F5", "B00008NRI7", "B000XJD33O", "B00AEFXYOA", "B002AS464Q", "B001KWRBH2", "B00BLN4UDS", "B0045DO83I", "B00005JPQE", "B000KGGIZA", "B002NZK5UU", "B00006ZXSL", "B00EEW1D2Y", "6305236569", "B00003CXO1", "B0001ADAVK", "0767811100", "B004EPZ070", "B0001AVZA8", "B0000897EG", "B000EHRVOW", "B00005O5CM", "B0007PLLBU", "6305428034", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00006ZXSQ", "B00447L4KA", "B00003CXTG", "6305428425", "B004SEUJK0", "0783235070", "B00AKGG6JS", "B0000VD02Y", "B00005T7I2", "B002ZG988M", "B00007BKVC", "6305213283", "B00006ZXSK", "0767803434", "B0000DZ6N3", "B00005Y1UV", "0800141741", "6305428395", "B00005JPSM", "B00006HAWN", "B00KNALRZ4", "B00003CY5G", "B004SIP8JI", "B00006AW0I", "B00008G7UF", "B000RO9PU0", "B00008G7UI", "B00005Y1UX", "0783226772", "B00002SSKI", "B00AMEZDJW", "078322740X", "6305213305", "B003BV8ICC", "B0042816YK", "B0000YEEGM", "B000HEWEE4", "B003Y5H524"], "bought_together": ["B00AEBB8NS", "B00386EZKE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00386EZKE", "B00006FMUW", "B00081U7HC", "6304765266"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 198584}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.89, "brand": "ROBERTS,JULIA", "asin": "0767802683", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Z8P4CFVRL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "My Best Friend's Wedding"}
{"description": "Call it \"Desperate Movie,\" because this ludicrous thriller deteriorates into unintentional comedy. For reasons that are never explained, a sociopathic killer (Michael Keaton) is the only available bone marrow donor for the cancer-stricken son of a San Francisco cop (Andy Garcia), who must capture the killer alive after a laughable escape in a labyrinthine hospital. The ensuing manhunt relies on plentiful plot holes and ridiculous shortcuts (like Keaton's use of a surgical laser to cut leg irons, or accessing hospital schematics from a prison computer). Self-consciously shot in film noir style, the cat-and-mouse routine leads to a briefly impressive car chase, but the premise (which even the movie's original press notes described as \"intriguing, if unlikely\") is based on \"moral ambiguity\" that doesn't translate from script to screen. Instead of forcing Keaton's typically \"sick genius\" to prove his ingenuity, the film pits him against a squad of cops who couldn't find a beer in a crowded pub.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00002E23C", "6305310335", "B00AEFYD9K", "B00008977C", "B00005JNNT", "B00000F5MN", "B000U1ZV76", "0767806808", "B00000IQC9", "B00008NFR3", "0767807588", "B00AEFXKZ8", "6305692572", "B0001932ZK", "B00009AOAZ", "0767810872", "0792844866", "B00007AJE1", "0783226888", "0783219571", "6305213305", "B00096S49Y", "B00029RT9E", "B000F6ZIII", "B00015YVDG", "B00008L3S6", "B000LBL3TK", "B002NZK5RI", "B003L20IG0", "B002KGVB7S", "B000N4RASS", "B004GJYRK0", "B00AEFXIIW", "B00005Y1UV", "B000C3L2PC", "B002AT8K9W", "B001KRVLCI", "B00005UQ9T", "0790736411", "0792833848", "B00JL6L4UY", "B000PISZ7W", "6305162026", "B00005QAOZ", "B0006D3HGA", "B000EU1ONS", "B000087F7R", "B002AT8KAG", "B007WZPQO6", "0783222149", "B00HLTD3ZW", "B000R4SMCW", "B00JDCP0QA", "6305308837", "B003AWRMA6", "B000NTMA0Q", "0790732149", "B003ASLJIQ", "B00004STDN", "B002LK3DZQ", "B000MEYKEG", "0767809726", "B0036TGT8Y", "B000B8GT92", "6304806434", "B00AEBB9NM", "B0045HCJFS", "6304602944", "B00005R5GA", "B004BSWC8A", "B002O3Z4WK", "B0000399WA", "B001R3YRG2", "B00003CXKA", "B00AEFYF2K", "0792844874", "B002ZG98SW", "B004SIP9CO", "B0001FGBWK", "630523650X", "B0045O2PHS", "B000P0J06K", "B001M9ELQC", "B00BGI07GC", "B000I2J736", "B001CW8016", "B00HLTD49C", "B003AWRM9M", "B000CBCWRG", "B000EQ5SRK", "6304765258", "B00008977A", "B001U0HB5Q", "B00FZ4KR4U", "B000F6ZIIS", "0783229402", "B00AEBB8O2", "B00CX7TOOG", "B000055Y0Y"], "bought_together": ["B00002E23C"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0783219571", "B000PISZ7W", "B00AEFYD9K", "B0001932ZK"]}, "price": 19.98, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 134257}, "asin": "0767812743", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/519STKWW5QL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Desperate Measures"}
{"description": "Best known forDeliverance(1972), John Boorman produced what is  arguably his greatest film withPoint Blank(1967). In that ambiguous gangster flick, set in a pastel L.A.  wasteland, Lee Marvin may or may not be a walking dead man, animated by the desire to avenge his fatal betrayal by the woman he loved and his best  friend. Many of Boorman's films take the form of quests, fueled by some dream  of utopia; on some level,Point Blankis the tragedy of a just man, appalled  and ultimately defeated by the complexity of his world's corruption.The Generalbegins with the death of Martin Cahill--celebrated Dublin gangster  who stole millions during the 1980s--then literally reverses the approach and  assault of his IRA assassin, flashing back in time, back through Cahill's  colorful, criminal quest for his kind of ideal community. Boorman says his  Cahill is a throwback to those Celtic chieftains of old who ruled by thievery  and violence; as an anachronism, this charming, brutal bear of a man  (perfectly incarnated by Brendan Gleeson) is undeniably reprehensible, but he  stands in deliberate contrast to the institutionalized hypocrisy and  corruption of church, state, and IRA alike. Brazenly hanging out in  police HQ to establish an alibi; maneuvering gracefully through perfectly  choreographed heists; dispensing affection to his wife, and her sister;  nailing the hands of a suspected cheat to a pool table; handing out food to women whose husbands are out of work--Gleeson's bluff, often comic gangster is always bigger than life, an eruption of unsocialized energy through the  layers-deep sediment of socially acceptable sin. (In real life as in the  film, Cahill always hid his face  under a sweatshirt hood, or behind his  spread fingers--he looks like some mischievous, giant-child.) Shot by the  great Seamus Deasey in color, then transferred to black-and-white stock,The  Generalis visually voluptuous, the anatomy of a charismatic monster's soul expressed in lustrous light, silken shades of gray, and ebony shadows.--Kathleen Murphy", "related": {"also_bought": ["B005WAP2V0", "B003UAKEBW", "B00005V1WP", "B003498SCQ", "B0002V7SOS", "B004XVMCQ2", "0783227906", "B0009G3BCY", "B0018BD9DA", "0783227329", "B000189LE2", "B00008DDHZ", "B004TPJN9Q", "B000JYW5AK", "B000AQKV1C", "B000OCY7JO", "0790729407", "B00000F3FS", "B001ADXX1E", "B00018D3L4", "B0000714BW", "B00007K02D", "B00DMDSC4S", "B004U7MR1Y", "B003LL3FIY", "B00IY1T8T6", "B00005JLR8", "B002U1LGSW", "B00260HH3U", "B00000ILEC", "B000GGSMC6", "B000QXDCLK", "B003T6LHWC", "B000XUOLQQ", "B005SYZZ7Q", "B004IY6A0S", "B007UW9W5U", "B00008RV0G", "B00005V9HK", "B00004TJKJ", "B0001EFV7C", "B00393SG56", "B003Y7F1M8", "B004ALIG1U", "B002U2Q0EG", "B002AMUDJY", "B002LYD2MG", "B00005QBZA", "B00018D40O", "B00004W5U6", "B007REV4LQ", "B005SH65G8", "B00005JN7T", "B000GIW9I2", "B009AMAL4Y", "B008H6GHE2", "B00F6SHGF8", "6305796297", "B000005IQX", "B000YENUI6", "B000CBG5PQ", "B004UVYQYQ", "B00FGVS07S", "0792163087", "B000063UQP", "B00B999E9O", "B000WPE8T2", "B0009GX1CE", "B005WKH3AI", "B000OCY7JE", "B003Y5H4R0", "B002XTXG1G", "B004W5MHL4", "B0000EYUBQ", "B00008DDVT", "B00D3DJIG8", "B00078XGRY", "B00BTYJYR6", "B007CEFTSA", "B000P6XU60", "B000X1Z0BU", "B0000SXK0E", "B00003CWSX", "B0014XVT98", "B00AEFY9GW", "B000093NQZ", "B00005B20H", "B000S8CLR4", "B00BJB2GRO", "B00BLF9FYA", "B0001GF2FQ", "B00097DY2A", "B000NOK0GW", "B000062XE6", "B008VF0XZ8", "B00009W5CA", "B00AQ5901E", "B000059HAE", "B002BWP3UC", "B004UVYQZA"], "bought_together": ["B005WAP2V0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005WAP2V0", "B001E18222", "B003UAKEBW", "0783227906"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 77130}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.99, "brand": "GLEESON,B/VOIGHT,J", "asin": "0767833600", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51kZ7m-s3ZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The General"}

{"description": "This smart, tautly directed thriller from Wolfgang Petersen is about the cat-and-mouse games between a Secret Service agent named Horrigan (Clint Eastwood) and the brilliant, psychopathic assassin (John Malkovich) who's itching to get the President in his cross hairs. The back-story--Horrigan is haunted by his inability to prevent John Kennedy's assassination (Eastwood is computer-generated into archival footage)--is more than a little hokey, but the plotting itself is smartly, even ingeniously, constructed. Petersen manages a viselike grip on the tension and Eastwood even gets to deliver an ever-more-timely lecture on the diminished nature of the office of President. Eastwood's as gruff and as infuriating to the by-the-book Powers That Be as ever, and Malkovich oozes delightful menace.

{"description": "Criterion's release of Carl Dreyer's landmark filmThe Passion of Joan of Arcis a definitive example of DVD restoration. Initially believed to be lost forever in a fire, this transfer was created at 24 frames per second from a negative of the rediscovered original version. For a film released in 1928,The Passion of Joan of Arclooks absolutely remarkable. As with most silent films, Dreyer'sJoanwas originally presented to audiences with different pieces of music. Criterion has chosen composer Richard Einhorn'sVoices of Lightfor this edition. Inspired by the film, Einhorn's piece, presented in 5.1 surround sound, is a wonderful compliment to Dreyer's visual presentation.   Notable extras include a history of the film's many versions and an audio interview with Renee Falconetti's daughter. However, by far the best \"extra\" is Dreyer scholar Casper Tybjerg's incredible commentary that informatively combines rich details of the film's importance and content with known historical elements of St. Joan's life, trial and death.--Rob Bracco", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000029NX", "B00005M2C7", "B00180R06I", "B00092ZLEY", "6305131104", "B00005JLV7", "6305257450", "B00005BHW6", "B000HT3QBO", "B0002DCHQA", "B000BB14IA", "B005HK13S6", "6305744114", "B00005O5CA", "B0000A02TX", "B000V7HFL4", "B0001UZWMU", "B005152C7S", "6305081034", "B00007CVS8", "B00006JMQG", "B0007989Y8", "B00HE011DE", "B001298BPY", "B001CD6HQA", "B001M9ELJY", "B00EO2I6W4", "B005HK13OK", "B000BB14I0", "B00000JS6F", "B00005UQ7T", "B001WLMOL4", "B00005QAPH", "B000E5LEV0", "B0056ANHCC", "B00005EBSF", "0780021541", "B000VUQ4HW", "0767845722", "B00065GX64", "B00GG0NABE", "B00006JMQH", "B006X96PBU", "B008CJ0JS4", "B0009WIE2U", "B0040QYROA", "B002U6DVQ2", "B000I8OOG0", "B001LMU1C8", "B00J2PQZRQ", "B000093NR0", "B004WPYO7E", "B00005NC66", "B002E01MBA", "B00004XQN5", "B000093NQZ", "B0007989ZC", "B00HVOFP08", "B00BX49B0C", "B000ZM1MIM", "B000AQKUG8", "1885983085", "B000BR6QIW", "B000EU1OXI", "B000FS9FLW", "B000N2HBIO", "B00005UQ7Q", "B0036SPDEG", "B00HE010LC", "B00AQ6J5YA", "B00J5LXMTG", "B00D9BNONW", "B00005JKPT", "B0002V7O0Q", "B00HVOFP6W", "B000PKG6O4", "B0002JP2OS", "B0026VBOJW", "B0000B1O9L", "B00005JLMU", "B001LMU19G", "B0012KHTEC", "B0001UZZS6", "0780020707", "B005152CC8", "B00393SFU2", "B004NWPY20", "B007N5YJPC", "B00005QW58", "B0035ECI0I", "B0000633SD", "B000127IF2", "B003WKL6YO", "B000305ZYS", "B00GRA7M2G", "B001MPS7GG", "B00064AEWY", "B00004Z1FM", "B000NOK0H6", "B004NWPY3E"], "bought_together": ["B0000029NX"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00000JS6F", "B0000029NX", "0767845722", "6305999872"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 49803}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 25.9, "brand": "DREYER,CARL", "asin": "0780022343", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4154H8KT15L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Passion of Joan of Arc (The Criterion Collection)"}
{"description": "Wes Craven's 1984 horror film is a better movie than it is generally credited for being. Forget the tawdry sequels; this highly original, almost surrealist work stars Robert Englund as a mutilated monster who kills teenagers during their dreams. Craven, who only directed one Elm Street sequel (Wes Craven's New Nightmare), takes the Hitchcockian step of layering in psychological explanations for the terror and then proving them all irrelevant in the face of mindless evil. The horror in the film is emotionally raw, in contrast to the overimaginative set pieces of most of the sequels that followed; and the final scene is as deeply unsettling as anything Luis Bu&ntilde;uel ever committed to film.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300214087", "B00023NRSM", "B0000039A6", "B00000JQTO", "6302975832", "6303396585", "630018403X", "0792836634", "0784011923", "0790700506", "B00000JQTR", "6301589025", "6302166926", "6300182878", "6301961404", "6300263681", "B00005JA8B", "6300184269", "6300267881", "6300214311", "6305095566", "B00000JQTQ", "0790742322", "B0000VCZMU", "0780607287", "0790705141", "6300214192", "6300214605", "6303506291", "0792839234", "630026999X", "6302921058", "0783235607", "6304509154", "6304288433", "B00000ILE6", "6300214656", "6300218058", "6302038308", "6301094352", "6302968143", "B00000JGEI", "6303257879", "6303265693", "0792846303", "630428845X", "6300247171", "B000005XXG"], "bought_together": ["6300214087", "B00023NRSM"], "also_viewed": ["0792836634", "B000BRKTL2", "0780627032", "B00023NRSM", "6300214087", "B000RIWAVW", "B0000039A6", "6302921058", "6302975832", "B00005LC4Q", "B000FA57UI", "6303396585", "0790705141", "B00AZ7V0W0", "B0089N4G50", "B00000JQTO", "6300182878", "0790700506", "6304288433", "B000FA57US", "6305095566", "B00KDU8HQQ", "B000VKL6Z2", "6301792769", "B001DJLD1W", "630428845X", "6300214192", "6304983794", "B00D7AM71A", "B000FS9FE4", "6304509154", "630229648X", "6301792734", "B00DEQQK8S", "6303265693", "0767817664", "B000RRJOPS", "6303257879", "0780630858", "B00000K3TO", "6301961404", "6304240562", "0783235607", "B0000VCZMU", "B0001611DI", "6301708695", "0780630866", "6300247171", "B00004SVYQ", "B00FN5Z8UY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 392902}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.92, "brand": "", "asin": "0780619412", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51BTBTJRFDL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Nightmare on Elm Street [VHS]"}
{"description": "Delivering exactly what its title promises, this celebration of stupidity was Jim Carrey's 1994 follow-up toAce Ventura: Pet DetectiveandThe Mask. The film pairs the rubber- faced wacky man with Jeff Daniels as the not-so-dynamic duo of Lloyd and Harry, dunderheads who come into the possession of a briefcase containing ransom money that is intended for Mob-connected kidnappers.  Lauren Holly costars as the woman who lost the briefcase, and with whom Carrey falls in love (both in real life and as his moronic on-screen character). As Lloyd and Harry make a mad dash to return the briefcase (never aware of its contents), the bumbling buddies attract Mobsters, cops, and trouble galore.

{"description": "Woody Allen roared back at his detractors withDeconstructing Harry, a bitterly funny treatise about the creative process. Known to mine his often tumultuous personal life for his movies, the embattled writer-director-star didn't bother to make his alter ego likable in this movie: Harry Block (Allen) pops pills, frequents prostitutes, and cheats on the women in his life, then writes about their foibles in thinly disguised fiction. No wonder they're all furious with him. As Harry journeys to his alma mater with a hooker, ill pal, and kidnapped son, a series of flashbacks unravel, juxtaposing Harry's relationships with their \"slightly exaggerated\" fictional counterparts. There are amusing cameos throughout, including a humorous turn by Demi Moore as a fictitious ex-wife who \"became Jewish with a vengeance,\" and Billy Crystal as the devil who found Hollywood too nasty for his liking.

{"description": "Packed with more than 750 dazzling visual effects, this $70 million adventure does more (and less) than give the 1965-68 TV series a state-of-the-art face-lift. Aimed at an audience that wasn't born when the series originally aired, the sci-fi extravaganza doesn't even require familiarity, despite cameo appearances by several of the TV show's original cast members. Instead it's a high-tech hybrid of the original premise with enough sensory overload to qualify as a spectacular big-screen video game, supported by a time-travel premise that's adequately clever but hardly original. It's certainly never boring, and visually it's an occasionally awesome demonstration of special effects technology. But in its attempt to be all things to all demographics, the movie's more of a marketing ploy than a satisfying adventure, thankfully dispensing with the TV show's cheesy camp but otherwise squandering a promising cast in favor of eye-candy and ephemeral storytelling.--Jeff Shannon", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 461880}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.47, "brand": "", "asin": "0780622642", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51KHA18R0JL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Lost in Space [VHS]"}
{"description": "The mind-bending worlds of author H.P. Lovecraft have long interested horror directors, but the films have rarely successfully captured his nightmarish mix of madness and mythology. John Carpenter'sIn the Mouth of Madnessis not directly based on Lovecraft's work, but screenwriter Michael De Luca draws his inspiration from Lovecraft's Cthulu mythology and then adds his own ingenious twists. John Trent (Sam Neill), an insurance investigator recently fitted for a straightjacket, tells his story to a psychiatrist. Hired to track down the missing pop-horror phenomena Sutter Cane, a Stephen King-like author whose fans are literally made for his books, Trent finds the supposedly fictional Hobb's End.  He watches the town collapse into madness, murder, and monstrous transformations: the fantastic horrors of Cane's novels played out in front of his eyes. \"Reality isn't what it used to be,\" deadpans one zombielike townsperson. In fact, it is how Cane writes it--but is he Devil, dark oracle, or simply a preacher in the service of an evil that grows stronger with every soul his books convert? The script never quite gets a grip on the blurry relationship between fact and fiction, but those details fade in the face of Carpenter's demented imagery, shiver-inducing twists, and dark wit. It's more eerie mind game than straight-out horror, a portrait of a world gone mad, and Carpenter relishes every hallucinatory moment.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000AOX0A", "0792839706", "B000RPCK2O", "B000067J0M", "B0085X315U", "B003V6XDP4", "B00AEFXW8I", "B000AM6OQ2", "B00005K3OC", "B0002CHK1S", "B000BQTC98", "B00B8O4WQA", "B0024FADBA", "B005OT810I", "B008CYDD7I", "B003TRMLQM", "B0000AOX0F", "B00008974J", "B00006AUIG", "0783116926", "B00KH57THK", "B0000DC12T", "B0009298N4", "B000MV8ABS", "B006LMRMMA", "B0053TWW9K", "6304936532", "B00009YXHN", "B00JQYV0B4", "B004EI2NPO", "B001B8XRT6", "B008874968", "B0000AOX09", "B00AGKH4MG", "B00009WNXA", "B00FYV7WCY", "B0000AOX0E", "B00009PY2T", "B002I41KNC", "B00J0IN6Z4", "B00FXOO1VC", "B002HML6YI", "B0024FAG44", "B000TZJCMS", "B0009X75J2", "157362408X", "B00004Y87O", "B000MV8AC2", "B000RPCJA2", "B000S0GYRU", "B002GHHHG0", "0783228457", "B008WAM2E2", "B00DOZNGTK", "B00D7AM6M0", "B000HEWEGC", "B00BTYPW7C", "B00005O439", "B000F3UA8E", "B00005KH30", "B001AGNMFI", "B00009OWI1", "6305258287", "B0053TWW36", "B0001ZX0GK", "B0002S9QUA", "B00IA1VKVY", "B0001XAKUQ", "B009EUVXZI", "0792841328", "B0002C9DK4", "B004EI2NP4", "B000QUCQX8", "B00005NRN6", "B00009MEC4", "B00003CY6P", "B001D5C1OO", "B000MV8ZCW", "B00006CXGP", "B006QWC2ZC", "B00G5GNYY2", "B0067QPVJ6", "B0001LQJMQ", "B000IJ7A5Q", "8598310042", "B00J81S92S", "B00023P4TM", "B000WC389G", "0790742829", "B000TUDBFC", "B0007WQHI0", "B00EZ50SGW", "B001J710Y8", "B0001611DI", "B002LMSWN2", "B00DBPBOZG", "B0014VPFVS", "B0053TWVIM", "B000MDFTHE"], "bought_together": ["B0000AOX0A"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0000AOX0A", "B0000AOX0F", "B00KDU8HQQ", "B000AM6OQ2"]}, "price": 27.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 56503}, "asin": "078062856X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/411R7MSBQ1L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "In the Mouth of Madness"}

{"description": "Coasting on the successes ofGods and MonstersandGeorge of the Jungle, Brendan Fraser turns in yet another winning performance in this fish-out-of-water comedy in which Pleasantville meets modern-day Los Angeles, with predictably funny results. Fraser stars as Adam, who was born in the bomb shelter of his paranoid inventor dad (a less-manic-than-usual Christopher Walken), who spirited his pregnant wife (Sissy Spacek, in fine comic form) underground when he thought the Communists dropped the bomb (actually, it was a plane crash). Armed with enough supplies to last 35 years, the parents bring up Adam inLeave It to Beaverstyle with nary any exposure to the outside world. When the supplies run out, and dad suffers a heart attack, Fraser goes up to modern-day L.A. for some shopping and long-awaited culture shock. More of a cute premise with lots of clever ideas attached than a fully fleshed out story,Blast from the Pastis also supposed to be part romantic comedy, as the hunky Adam hooks up with his jaded Eve (Alicia Silverstone) and tries to convince her to marry him and go underground. The sparks don't fly, though, because Silverstone is saddled with the triple whammy of being miscast, playing an underwritten character, and suffering a very bad hairdo. Fraser, however, carries the film lightly and easily on his broad, goofy shoulders, mixing Adam's gee-whiz innocence with genuine emotion and curiosity; only Fraser could pull off Adam's first glimpse of a sunrise or the ocean with both humor and pathos. Also winning is Dave Foley as Silverstone's gay best friend, who manages to make the most innocuous statements sound like comic gems.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005RIJ3"], "bought_together": ["B00005RIJ3"], "also_viewed": ["B00G5G7EXY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 277212}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.95, "brand": "", "asin": "0780626478", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/513Y40DFZ6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Blast From the Past [VHS]"}

{"description": "Although it wasn't a box-office success when originally released in 1958,Vertigohas since taken its deserved place as Alfred Hitchcock's greatest, most spellbinding, most deeply personal achievement. In fact, it consistently ranks among the top 10 movies ever made in the once-a-decadeSight & Soundinternational critics poll, placing at number 4 in the 1992 survey. (Universal Pictures' spectacularly gorgeous 1996 restoration and rerelease of this 1958 Paramount production was a tremendous success with the public, too.) James Stewart plays a retired police detective who is hired by an old friend to follow his wife (a superb Kim Novak, in what becomes a double role), whom he suspects of being possessed by the spirit of a dead madwoman. The detective and the disturbed woman fall (\"fall\" is indeed the operative word) in love and...well, to give away any more of the story would be criminal.

{"description": "Arnold Schwarzenegger made a successful transition to comedy with this 1990 box-office hit directed by Ivan Reitman. Arnold plays an undercover cop whose attempt to locate a little boy and his mother leads him to a small-town kindergarten class, where he poses as a teacher while continuing his investigation. He's also trying to catch a vicious drug dealer (Richard Tyson), whose ex-wife and son are the pair that Arnold's trying to rescue from impending danger. The scenes featuring Arnold and a classroom full of kindergartners are a real hoot, and Pamela Reed offers enjoyable support as Schwarzenegger's police partner, while Penelope Ann Miller (as another teacher) provides a low-key romantic interest and Carroll Baker steals her scenes as the villain's domineering mother. These familiar elements combine to make this a surprisingly lively and entertaining comedy-thriller, but parents are advised to heed the PG-13 rating: there are a lot of funny kids in the movie, but it's still a police thriller, with a violent climax that's not suitable for young viewers.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783226926", "B00026ZG10", "B00005T7HZ", "B00000G3TN", "B00HZMZ2FE", "0783230370", "B000Y11B7Q", "6305236569", "B000065V42", "B001LMAK9C", "B002GHHHME", "B00AKGG828", "B00070FX5U", "B0009DWL8W", "B000QQLVPQ", "B00ALTQRRK", "B000TJBN6W", "B00004RJ73", "B000RW3VCK", "B00015YVDG", "B00081U7HC", "0767803434", "B0000WN0UU", "B00005T7I2", "B000FO0AA6", "B0006GANOQ", "6305433925", "B00AEFXT1S", "0783219806", "078322740X", "0783230494", "B0002J58HO", "B000068QPM", "B00005N5S5", "6305428050", "B00000IQW2", "B002XUBDRY", "0783227396", "B00AEFY4CG", "0767804309", "B000056PMU", "B008R65XKQ", "0783225547", "B000K7VHTQ", "B002GHHHNS", "B00AEBB9E6", "6305428271", "B00004STDN", "6304602944", "B00008G8LM", "B00005JMCW", "B000FO0A9W", "B001SXZ7T2", "B0028ZDJN0", "B000YGGNMO", "0800177258", "B00158K0QU", "B002VWNID6", "B001OST0LW", "B0007PLLBU", "B00005PJ6N", "6305428395", "B00005JKCB", "B0043X1FLI", "B000P0J09W", "B00015YVD6", "B0045HCJGC", "0783227388", "0783229364", "B00JPQ1HX4", "B000065V3H", "0792844866", "B000YDBPAM", "B003VA3JUO", "B00005KAQP", "0783235070", "B0000AK7AA", "B00AEFY0F2", "B000RBA6C4", "0783231644", "B00008L3U1", "B00008G8M4", "B001OST0M6", "B005QX8U2Q", "0783225946", "B0001Z37HM", "6304806434", "0783227965", "B0006N2EZ0", "B000P0J0A6", "B00005T7I3", "B00000G3PA", "0767855000", "B00009WVSL", "B00005T7I1", "0790742071", "B00005JM4W", "B00AEFXPG2", "B00008O38G", "B0000UJDLM"], "bought_together": ["B00005T7HZ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0045HCJSA", "B000RJO56E", "0790732157", "B00ALTQRRK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 8184}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.49, "brand": "Universal Pictures", "asin": "0783225504", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51YE80NP76L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Kindergarten Cop"}
{"description": "Director Martin Scorsese reunites with members of hisGoodFellasgang (writer Nicholas Pileggi; actors Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, and Frank Vincent) for a three-hour epic about the rise and fall of mobster Sam &quot;Ace&quot; Rothstein (De Niro), a character based on real-life gangster Frank &quot;Lefty&quot; Rosenthal. (It's modeled after onWiseguyandGoodFellasand Pileggi's true crime bookCasino: Love and Honor in Las Vegas.)  Through Rothstein, the picture tells the story of how the Mafia seized, and finally lost control of, Las Vegas gambling. The first hour plays like a fascinating documentary, intricately detailing the inner workings of Vegas casinos. Sharon Stone is the stand out among the actors; she nabbed an Oscar nomination for her role as the voracious Ginger, the glitzy call girl who becomes Rothstein's wife. The film is not as fast paced or gripping as Scorsese's earlier gangster pictures (Mean StreetsandGoodFellas), but it's still absorbing. And, hey--it's Scorsese!--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000P0J09M", "B000C20VRS", "B00004XPPB", "B000P0J0AG", "B0000AM6JI", "B0006GAOJA", "B0019L770A", "B0019L21GA", "B00003CXWV", "0767830555", "B000286RP2", "B0018CMJSU", "B000M341QE", "B004SIP7TE", "B002CPMB9O", "B00AEBB9NM", "B00004U103", "B0000DI87S", "B00008975Z", "B00013RC2U", "B00CCMKPO0", "B0019L21H4", "B000A2UBN4", "B006TTC5HC", "B004SIP95G", "B007TBIUSM", "B002QEHPQU", "B000H5TH20", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00005V9HH", "B00G1C2URC", "B00011CZRE", "B002VWNIEA", "B002T9H2LA", "B0000AMJEK", "B0001FGBUW", "B000P0J0EW", "B000A7DVR2", "6305313687", "B004G7XCRQ", "B000P0J0D8", "B000LP6KNU", "B0007DFJ0G", "1558908390", "B000P0J09C", "B00080ZG10", "B00005B6JZ", "B000CNESTE", "B004FQX5B6", "B000067IZ3", "B004U7MR14", "0783229526", "B00H9KKGTO", "B00008RH3L", "B0018CWW5K", "B002CA68N4", "B00562D3Y2", "B006X08FGW", "B007D5E7C2", "B000SFOW8I", "B008R65XYC", "B00005ATQB", "B00001ZWUS", "B000EHSVRI", "B00AEFXESQ", "B0009A40ES", "B002ZG99N6", "B003ELKNH2", "B000OT6V0K", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B000002OZ9", "B000MZHW40", "B00AEFXKUI", "B004L9GMBC", "B00006RCNV", "B000PAAJZ6", "B001JIE7JC", "B00AEBB95K", "B004SIP93S", "B000E5KQHI", "B00IEK9U0E", "B0000AMRJE", "B000ZM1MGE", "B000QEIOT4", "B0041QSZS8", "B000093FLA", "B0000YEE6M", "B002VWNIDG", "B00029RTAI", "B002NZK5QO", "B00AEBB9CS", "B00079Z9VO", "B00AEBB8LA", "B007SPPANM", "B000035Z5G", "B00004XPPG", "079284646X", "B000FI8MPW", "B003AWRMCE", "B00AEFY0F2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000P0J09M", "B000C20VRS", "B008R65XYC", "B000M341QE"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 158336}, "asin": "0783225792", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/712YQJ017YL._SY300_.gif", "title": "Casino"}

{"description": "When attorney Julie Hastings (Frances McDormand) uncovers corrupt city real estate dealings, evil thugs attack her scientist boyfriend, Peyton Westlake (Liam Neeson). Left for dead after his lab is detonated, he miraculously survives when the ensuing blast hurls him into the nearby harbor. Treated as a John Doe at a city hospital, he is unknowingly submitted to radical therapy which numbs his nerves to feeling--but which heightens his strength and his emotions. Once conscious, Peyton escapes from the hospital and builds a ramshackle lab in an abandoned industrial plant. Horribly burned and scarred by the lab explosion, he uses synthetic skin to impersonate his would-be murderers and seek retribution for their evil deeds. Peyton also tries to reunite with Julie, who believes him to be dead. While the film has an average script, it is overcome by the flashy cinematography of Bill Pope, the bombastic score by Danny Elfman, and the well-choreographed direction of Sam Raimi. The director confidently walks the line between suspense, action, comedy, and romance as he examines a bitter, victimized antihero who risks becoming as monstrous on the inside as he appears on the outside.--Bryan Reesman", "related": {"also_bought": ["078323046X", "078321958X", "B0003JANT6", "B00BTYMPUY", "B0007PALZ2", "B003498SCQ", "078322799X", "B0009X768W", "B00005N7Z1", "B0002J58HO", "6305428514", "B00003CXQA", "B002AS466O", "B0009PVZD2", "B005LAIIRQ", "B001R3YRG2", "B0009X76XC", "B004A8ZX28", "B0015XHQT4", "B00AEFXCLU", "B0085A9HU6", "B000RW3VCK", "B00005JLWN", "B00007AJG4", "B00005K3NR", "0783225520", "B001F7MSFM", "079284646X", "B00008L3UM", "B002O3Z4ZW", "B0000A9GHD", "1558908846", "B00004Y87O", "B00FQPLZ08", "B000OVLBHG", "B001J710Y8", "0767802454", "B0001Z37HM", "0783227434", "0783229402", "B00026ZG10", "B00008G8LY", "6304698747", "B005J9ZFQG", "B000PMFRZQ", "B0045HCJGC", "0767821629", "0767817710", "B000NOIVT0", "B001JFZ118", "B001B43IVW", "B00005JKWJ", "B00005N5RM", "B000068IEV", "B0045HCJG2", "0783223609", "B0007PALGG", "B0024FADD8", "078401132X", "6304723113", "B0001VTPW2", "B00000ILDD", "6305767866", "079283366X", "B001TODCII", "B00005M2CO", "B00J2PQYYK", "B0067EKYAY", "B000FFJYAC", "B00BPEJWAE", "B002GHHHG0", "B002ZG994U", "B0007V6ITE", "B000MV8ABS", "B000NIBURQ", "B0040J1RX6", "B00001O2H0", "B004BZ5AN2", "0767815718", "B00003CXKA", "B003XURDAY", "0767811097", "B0002KVUKM", "B007ZC31R0", "B009AMAJPA", "0783226934", "B001FZQOW2", "B008G33PIM", "B0000UJL96", "B00004XMSC", "B00441GYZG", "B00DW5IKW0", "B003AWRM9W", "B00441GYXS", "B000031EG1", "0790729342", "B000NO1XJA", "B0090EDEM8", "B00007AJGH", "B003UGLCIA"], "bought_together": ["078323046X", "B0003JANT6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000PFUAP0", "078321958X", "6305841985", "B00GHH9IIA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 56997}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.86, "brand": "Universal", "asin": "0783226012", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51B63F94CML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Darkman"}

{"description": "Who would have guessed that this clever, fast-paced creature feature from 1990 would become a beloved miniclassic?Tremorsdidn't actually break any new ground (even though its tunneling worm monsters certainly did), but it revved up the classic monster-movie formulas of the 1950s with such energetic enthusiasm and humor that it made everything old seem new again. It's also got a cast full of enjoyable actors who clearly had a lot of fun making the film, and director Ron Underwood strikes just the right balance of comedy and terror as a band of small-town rednecks battles a lot of really nasty-looking giant worms. The special effects are great, the one-liners fly fast and furious between heroes Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward (and yes, that's country star Reba McEntire packin' awesome firepower), and it's all done with the kind of flair one rarely associates with goofy monster flicks like this.

{"description": "A movie that only true horror buffs could love,Army of Darknessis officially part 3 in the wild and wacky Evil Dead trilogy masterminded by the perversely inventive director Sam Raimi, who would later serve as executive producer of the popular syndicated TV seriesHercules: The Legendary Journeys.Raimi's favorite actor, Bruce Campbell, returns as Ash (hero of the first two Evil Dead flicks), a hardware-store clerk who is magically transported--along with his beat-up Oldsmobile and a chainsaw attachment for his severed left forearm--to the brutal battlefields of the 14th century. He quickly assumes power (who else in the Middle Ages packs a shotgun and a chainsaw?), and unites his band of medieval knights against the dreaded Army of the Dead. Raimi gleefully subverts almost every horror-movie clich&eacute; as he serves up a nonstop parade of blood, gore, and vicious sword-bearing skeletons--an affectionate homage to animator Ray Harryhausen's classicJason and the Argonauts. The frantic action is fun while it lasts, but even at 80 minutesArmy of Darknessnearly wears out its welcome. You know that Raimi can maintain the mayhem for only so long before it grows tiresome, and fortunately this madcap movie quits while it's ahead.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B005J9ZFQG", "B000WC3864", "B008JFUNYG", "B001KEGR5M", "B0001LQJMQ", "B003S6S7TY", "B004GGU9K0", "B000QUCQX8", "B008CYDD7I", "B005J9ZE5I", "B00C6F61IW", "B004GGU9JQ", "B00004Y87O", "B000WC38FA", "B000AQ69QS", "B0006A9FKA", "B00IF8Q0YE", "B0013D8LAE", "B000RIWAVW", "B0002C9DK4", "B000F7CMPE", "B0001611DI", "B0000AOX0F", "B002LMSWN2", "B000FS9FE4", "B0002CHK1S", "157362408X", "B000IJ7A5Q", "B002GHHHG0", "B00D7AM6M0", "B000I2J68M", "B00009MGEM", "B001NPD9LS", "B00AQJ8MLY", "B000VKL6Z2", "B004SIP6LS", "B00007AJG4", "B002JT69IW", "0790729342", "B0009OUBC4", "B00005JA8B", "B001D5C1OO", "B000V4UFZK", "B00005LC4Q", "B0056P6SOG", "B004P7CMOQ", "B000UAE7O0", "B000WC389G", "B0016MJ6P6", "B000I0RNVQ", "B008WAM2E2", "B0001US7OA", "B00005N5RM", "B00AEFY2WI", "B000FJH5MC", "B000099T3M", "B004EI2NP4", "B00005JO16", "B008G33PIM", "B001DJLD1W", "B000TSIJWY", "B001DJLD0S", "B000AXWHSA", "B000FA57UI", "B00AEFXW8I", "B00018D42W", "B000068IEV", "B000S0GYRU", "B000FA57US", "6304712499", "B001B8XRT6", "B002VWNIDG", "B002OVO18A", "B0002ABURA", "B00006FDCD", "B00AEFYDM2", "B0028DRGDQ", "B008874968", "B0000AOX09", "B001KEGR5W", "B0000VCZNE", "0312291450", "B0087ZG7UW", "B0024FAG44", "B0053TWV46", "B0058I9DZM", "B003VMFWXO", "B003WTO5NO", "B0015U0QWG", "B004XVMCH6", "B004LWZW24", "B001B1UO6W", "B005HI4LMS", "B000LP6KNU", "B004SIP9Z6", "B00317LM8S", "B0031U8OEK", "B0024FADBA", "B000C20VRS"], "bought_together": ["B005J9ZFQG", "B000WC3864"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005J9ZFQG", "B00005R24K", "B008JFUNYG", "B009JBWOU0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 22777}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.74, "brand": "Universal Studios", "asin": "0783227434", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DQ0H428VL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Army of Darkness"}
{"description": "With its high-intensity plot about an attempt to assassinate French President Charles de Gaulle, the bestselling novel by Frederick Forsyth was a prime candidate for screen adaptation. Director Fred Zinnemann brought his veteran skills to bear on what has become a timeless classic of screen suspense. Not to be confused with the later remakeThe Jackalstarring Bruce Willis (which shamelessly embraced all the bombast that Zinnemann so wisely avoided), this 1973 thriller opts for lethal elegance and low-key tenacity in the form of the Jackal, the suave assassin played with consummate British coolness by Edward Fox. He's a killer of the highest order, a master of disguise and international elusiveness, and this riveting film follows his path to de Gaulle with an intense, straightforward documentary style. Perhaps one of the last great films from a bygone age of pure, down-to-basics suspense (and a kind of debonair European alternative to the American grittiness ofThe French Connection),The Day of the Jackalis a cat-and-mouse thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat until its brilliantly executed final scene (pardon the pun), by which time Fox has achieved cinematic immortality as one of the screen's most memorable killers.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00441GYYC", "B00005QCVP", "B004IFYMXO", "B004OB2EYQ", "B0074B2N58", "B003O7I6SE", "B0007ZEOQE", "B000HT3PBU", "B00005JP3T", "B00000K3C9", "B000PFUAPK", "B000E5N6KW", "B003AWRMCO", "B00FNR9ZKG", "B00008AOTO", "0451239377", "B0006B2A42", "B000MGTQ7U", "B004IFYMXE", "0792838408", "B0003JANSW", "0792844017", "B000EHSVS2", "B0015YY768", "B001EOQCJE", "B000CEXEWA", "B005HQBO9I", "B00441GYOM", "B000H1RFSM", "B00AEFXLKC", "B000A2WJBQ", "B0070MZ0G0", "B000056HEA", "B00004XPPC", "B00096S4B2", "B00004RF83", "B0045HCIZE", "B0001NBMH6", "B000FP2OP4", "B005DTZXMI", "B00DOZNJ2Y", "B000066C6H", "B000NQQ4I8", "B00008OE4W", "B00FNRA10E", "B00AEFYBA6", "B004UOHNAC", "B00061QJ8A", "B00005N5S2", "B00008MTVZ", "B00006ADD5", "B00AEFYPHA", "B0007TKNM4", "B0002HOEQ2", "B004I1K066", "B0008ENHTO", "B000NO1XJA", "B00008AOTR", "B005DXCO94", "B00008V6Y1", "B00049QQJQ", "B007N31YH0", "B00005JKFR", "B0006UEVVS", "B00JPQ1IJM", "B0014BQR1A", "B000062XEX", "B000SK5Z70"], "bought_together": ["B00441GYYC", "B00005QCVP"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00441GYYC", "B003O7I6SE", "B00CVDNJ7A", "B00005QCVP"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 10482}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.88, "brand": "UNI DIST CORP.

{"description": "The original cowriter and director ofFear and Loathing in Las Vegaswas Alex Cox, whose earlier filmSid and Nancysuggests that Cox could have been a perfect match in filming  Hunter&nbsp;S. Thompson's psychotropic masterpiece of \"gonzo\" journalism. Unfortunately Cox departed due to the usual \"creative differences,\" and this ill-fated adaptation was thrust upon Terry Gilliam, whose formidable gifts as a visionary filmmaker were squandered on the seemingly unfilmable elements of Thompson's ether-fogged narrative. The result is a one-joke movie without the joke--an endless series of repetitive scenes involving rampant substance abuse and the hallucinogenic fallout of a road trip that's run crazily out of control. Johnny Depp plays Thompson's alter ego, \"gonzo\" journalist Raoul Duke, and Benicio Del Toro is his sidekick and so-called lawyer Dr. Gonzo. During the course of a trip to Las Vegas to cover a motorcycle race, they ingest a veritable chemistry set of drugs, and Gilliam does his best to show us the hallucinatory state of their zonked-out minds. This allows for some dazzling imagery and the rampant humor of stumbling buffoons, and the mumbling performances of Depp and Del Toro wholeheartedly embrace the tripped-out, paranoid lunacy of Thompson's celebrated book. But over two hours of this insanity tends to grate on the nerves--like being the only sober guest at a party full of drunken idiots. So while Gilliam's film may achieve some modest cult status over the years, it's only becauseFear and Loathingis best enjoyed by those who are just as stoned as the characters in the movie.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0006H32EI", "B006ISJQ1W", "B00003CXWV", "0767837398", "B002AF4Y9G", "B000A7DVR2", "B001EDFSIQ", "0679785892", "B0057ZAA6W", "6305313687", "B00029RTAI", "B0007DFJ0G", "B002QEHPQU", "B00008975Z", "B001HN69AY", "B004SIP9Z6", "B00005JM23", "B000F7CECK", "B000JMK6LW", "B000093FLA", "B000P0J09M", "B003HKN52U", "0783225903", "B00005R87R", "B004SIP95G", "B00000IRE6", "B000031EFY", "B00005ATQB", "B005Y4I6VW", "B0006HBZE2", "B00005Q4CS", "B004FQX5B6", "B009NNXQJW", "B0000VD04M", "B00006JDU8", "B00005V9HH", "B00011CZRE", "B002T9H2LA", "B000C20VPA", "B002CPMB9O", "B000AXWHSA", "B000ASDFI6", "B000P0J0D8", "0792838068", "B003W88QVC", "B00029RTCG", "B0011E5M66", "B0007PALZ2", "B00005JMJG", "B007D0FVRM", "B001J9KJ4I", "B006ISJQBM", "B000EMGJAO", "B0000CDUT5", "B000KB4898", "B0000AC8LR", "B004P7CNC2", "B004SIP7TE", "B00AEFXE9U", "B004SIP8ES", "B00AEFYS2M", "B000C20VRS", "B0000AC8LI", "B00ALU48M0", "B0009A40ES", "B000LP6KNU", "B00H9KKGTO", "B00AEBB8NI", "B0000640VJ", "B004SIP6LS", "B000286RP2", "B000GGSMC6", "0780621611", "B001HN694K", "B00009W5CA", "B004XVMCH6", "B001GCUO0W", "B000GBEWGQ", "B0006GAOJA", "B008R65XYC", "B000IY04Q8", "B000006NN1", "B000S6M1Y4", "B0012E2GFK", "B0007UC8Y4", "B0043X1FM2", "B0001CNRRU", "B00ALU46VI", "0767835093", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00005NTOH", "B000MMMT9G", "B005LAIIJY", "B00AG4714S", "B00000K3TS", "B000053VAZ", "B00009MGEM", "B001M4YZ90", "B002ZG980U", "1451659717"], "bought_together": ["B00003CXWV"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0679785892", "B00029RTAI", "0783225903", "B000A7DVR2"]}, "price": 5.0, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 3274}, "asin": "0783229526", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51LL2U2I2AL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"}
{"description": "\"One gasbag meets another\" is how critic Pauline Kael described the \"flatulent seriousness\" that director Robert Wise brought to this 1975 thriller about the ill-fated German zeppelin which exploded while landing in New Jersey in 1937. The great air disaster is speculatively depicted here as an act of sabotage, and the airship's trans-Atlantic journey gives the saboteur's plot plenty of time to unfold while the story introduces a variety of characters aboard for the luxurious flight. While the anti-Nazi message is delivered loud and clear, Anne Bancroft and George C. Scott lead an illustrious cast in what amounts to a pre-World War II episode ofThe Love Blimp,only there's not much romance and precious little suspense. It's all rather flatly intriguing, but aviation buffs will certainly appreciate the meticulous attention to period detail, and the film won special achievement Oscars for its impressive sound and visual effects. Worth a look, if you're a student of this particular chapter of history, and the movie earns some credit for having at least the kernel of a good idea.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B003L2BZ0I", "B000ETRA5U", "B00AFEYS9A", "B000EHSVOG", "B004M9QNUG", "B000EHSVNW", "B001KO1BCG", "B00GOYC3N8", "0783229399", "B000C20VO6", "B00561BNJA", "B0002HZ24A", "B00008438U", "B000HEWEF8", "B005E7SFDI", "B00351QB5Y", "B00008AOTN", "0446517844", "B00LC4PFOY", "B000067FP4", "B00005JP3T", "B00JQHOKTA", "B0014Z4OMK", "B003L16F7C", "B0000YEE58", "B000GRUMPU", "B006ML50SS", "B004176JJY", "B00AEFXLKC", "B00008AOTR", "B0001FGC1U", "B008A1TWXC", "B006X0ZN26", "B00FM4S7FE", "B004FN26BE", "B00KGLS050", "0316123862", "B00E5N8SFC", "B000FTCLR6", "B00008AOTO", "B001709LD4", "0792839064", "B0045HCJKS", "B000092Q5E", "B00005JKU0", "B003GWE582", "B000O78KWE", "B002EAYEAG", "B00005N5S2", "B005HQBO9I", "184797161X", "B0024LIBDQ", "B004LB5FDG", "B0087ZG7LG", "B00005N5S3", "B00005YUNO", "B0006B2A42", "B000FTCLQM", "B0000DGKI8", "B000OHZJO6", "B000NTPG6Q", "B0026KWLAO", "B00005QCVP", "B00A2XQTAU", "B000A2WJBQ", "B002GHHHPQ", "B0066E6O7C", "B004IFYMXE", "B00008LDO9", "B00108FMFO", "B004I1K05W", "B00014NEX0", "B0002CR04A", "B005TCLBY8", "B007RFJCN2", "B004R6EFAO", "B00I3RHUX2", "B00AEFY6DI", "B00005OSJQ", "B00HZVX14O", "B00BWJQEFI", "B000E5N6KW", "0752451758", "B0019UGYA0", "B0045HCJSA", "B0006HBV3C", "B005SYZYZ4", "1560982195", "B00AEFYO5I", "B0024F08UG", "B00JG88XD8", "B000RXVND8"], "bought_together": ["B003L2BZ0I"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AFEYS9A", "B003L2BZ0I", "B000EHSVOG", "B000EHSVNW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 83556}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.8, "brand": "UNIVERSAL", "asin": "0783229372", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GZ235B6RL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Hindenburg"}
{"description": "Acquanetta carries on as the lady with a simian alter ego. Although Cheelah the gorilla was shot dead at the end of \"Captive Wild Woman,\" the beast within still lives. A doctor (J. Carrol Naish), driven by scientific curiosity, salvages the body and revives the primate. After the recovered Cheelah disappears from the lab, the mysterious Paula Dupree appears at the country sanitarium where the good doctor carries on his tampering in God's domain. Her human hormones lead her to obsess over a young man engaged to another woman. Death and terror rule the night as Paula suffers \"ape-woman\" interludes sparked by her jealous rage. Brevity is a virtue realized in the tight 61 minute running time of this movie. The plot doesn't have time to go awry. Acquanetta's understated acting consists mostly of long silent stares that emphasize her deep dark eyes. Terror lurks in the trees, passes by windows, and drapes sinister shadows across one's path. Farm animals perish brutally by night. When the beast is ascendant, birds and other woodland creatures go berserk, to the consternation of those persons alone in the woods. Much is suggested, but little is displayed. The fright make-up only appears briefly in a flashback segment and again in the final scene. Perhaps this subtle terror method was done to emulate Val Lewton, as Mr. Maltin suggests. Regardless, it probably saved production costs. This is an entertaining albeit second-string entry from Universal's fright factory. It doesn't pretend to be more. Collector's of classic horror films need this movie for their personal collection. Others should adjust their expectations accordingly", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 344931}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "title": "Jungle Woman [VHS]", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783228120", "B000FWHW8Q", "B0013XZ6SY", "B000FWHW90", "630312917X", "B000WNHTCC", "B0009X770E", "B00AOO5NW2", "B00B2M79XQ", "B009AGEWYA", "B00A1AU720", "B005J89RDE", "B00BY8DJW8"], "also_viewed": ["6303129188", "0783228120", "B000WNHTCC", "B008FL8OTK", "B000FWHW90"]}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51NYW391REL._SY300_.jpg", "asin": "0783228112"}

{"description": "Back in 1952, during the waning days of film noir, director  Richard Fleischer madeThe Narrow Margin, a cheaply produced, tightly structured B&nbsp;movie thriller about a cop forced to protect a gangster's widow while on a train. While it's no work of art, Fleischer's noir features a shocking climax of mistaken identity, an ominous, claustrophobic atmosphere, and tough, nearly unlikable protagonists screwed by fate, who spout sharp-witted dialogue and feel little more than contempt for each other. When Hollywood remakes itself, all the understatement and charm is usually lost when the filmmakers try to \"modernize\" the subject matter. This is one of many problems with writer-director Peter Hyams's remake (given the slightly shorter titleNarrow Margin). He's  dumped the surprising plot twist (it's now an action set piece atop a moving train) and softened the characters (now played with sleepwalking intensity by Gene Hackman and Anne Archer) with preposterous motivations. All that seems to be intact is the train premise, but Hyams is more interested in its action potential than any kind of menacing atmosphere. He's dropped the ambiguous relationships and smart dialogue in favor of pumping up the action sequences and daredevil stunts to ridiculous levels. Instead of adding excitement, all Hyams's expensive tricks do is drainNarrow Marginof any tension it might've retained from the original.--Dave  McCoy", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0008KLVAU", "B00008L3UQ", "B0009GX1CE", "B003A12WBQ", "B00005UQ9T", "B000035P5V", "B000244GCW", "B0006HBZBA", "B00AEBB86U", "B00008L3S6", "6305428115", "0792844874", "B00004ZDFL", "B00000K3TU", "B003ASLJIQ", "B003O7I6SE", "B0043X1FNQ", "B00004ZBVG", "B00AEFXT1S", "B001UDS4BS", "B00AEFXIIW", "B0045HCJ8K", "B00006L92Q", "B00013RC66", "B002QW7AMG", "B00AEBB8LA", "B0006GANN2", "B00441GYYC", "B00441GYOM", "B000P0I4O4", "6305133476", "B0039A9M7K", "B00009MEKO", "B0008KLVA0", "B00096S49Y", "B000CEV3M8", "B0007KIFGE", "6305308837", "B00AEBB8O2", "B000063US3", "B002NZK5UU", "B00AEFYC96", "0767817729", "B00AEFXYJA", "0783226853", "B00AEBB9UK", "0783226942", "6305310335", "B00AEFYW64", "0767809726", "B002AS464Q", "B000055Y0Y", "B000059TFO", "B00097DY2A", "B002O3Z4WK", "B007FQXEWI", "B003AWRMBU", "0790730979", "B001T21R50", "B0006HBZXS", "B003INBNOS", "B00AEFXEGS", "B00008K76V", "B00014NEZI", "B00008OE4W", "0792840445", "B002AT8K9W", "B00AEBB9EG", "B00HLTD3ZW", "B00JPQ1I7O", "B001AR011A", "B00066FB52", "0783226888", "B002NZK5RI", "B000059XTK", "6304765258", "B005LAIGRS", "B0045HCJFS", "B002AT8KAG", "B00AEFYF2K", "B000G5SILC", "B00097DY1G", "B000ENC5YW", "B00015YVDG", "B00005YUNT", "B0045HCJIK", "B000F8DV1M", "B000E5N684", "B000B8GT92", "B003L20IG0", "B00006L92V", "B000PFUAPK", "B000065V3E", "B000FP2OP4", "0767807588", "0790732149", "B00008L3UE", "630542828X", "B003AWRMCO", "B00803PG44"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00008L3UQ", "B00AEBB86U", "B0006HBZBA", "6305428115"]}, "price": 6.94, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 187189}, "asin": "0784011699", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RMDH3Y8GL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Narrow Margin"}

{"description": "This is a solid collection of vintage Mickey Mouse cartoons, presented  virtually complete, for once, and not just as a cut-and-paste clips assortment. (Introductory material is cobbled together from oldMickey Mouse ClubandWonderful World of Disneybroadcasts.) The program is fun to watch, but it's also a revealing historical pageant. In classic action-comedy items like \"Mickey's Trailer\" and \"Mr. Mouse Takes a Trip,\" it is clear that the Disney Studio's faultless technique, even when dealing with elaborate props and frantic activity, is a tradition that was established early on. And in tales of interspecies conflict like \"Lend a Paw\" and \"Mickey's Seal\" (both involving pitched battles between Mickey's dog Pluto and cuddly interlopers in the Mouse household), we can see how that institutional polish blunts the edge of the comedy--in sharp contrast, for instance, to the rough and raucous Warner Brothers style. Purists will fume over some of the choices that were made here: no original release dates are given for the cartoons, the credit sequences are missing, and the colors have been digitally homogenized. But get real: this is mass-market shelf-filler packaged for the Disney Stores, and as such it's a cut above.--David Chute", "related": {"also_bought": ["6304400225", "0788812440", "B000063V8H", "6300274608", "B00005RDWC", "B00005K9OA", "155890641X", "B00000J2JA", "B000035Z46", "6302526574", "6300274268", "B00000ICHA", "6300276813", "6304978286", "6304401132", "6305950547", "B0001I55VK", "0788802194", "6300274195", "0788812408", "B0000AQZYM", "B00004R99D", "6301390725", "B000035Z2S", "B000XUOIQO", "6305229449", "6305319138", "6304290888", "B00003CX7L", "6301753534", "B00004R99H", "6302178924", "6304400551", "6303441408", "0788812181", "0788810995", "6302409853", "6303314015", "B00004R996", "6304400381", "B00003CXHR", "6302787068", "0788803743", "6304501153", "B00004R99A", "0788810634", "6302642248", "6301290895", "6302158095", "6304155972", "6303929478", "0788806270", "B000063V8N", "B0000E32WB", "6303036813", "6304089767", "B000JHG4R2", "6304100507", "6305940932", "6304492952", "6303929338", "6303439330", "0788805533", "B00005JLR2", "B00004R99N", "B00001YX9H", "B00005JKX3", "6302320402", "6303983812", "6303921140", "6304500831", "1558906150", "0788805843", "B00000ICHI", "B000JBWWRO", "B00000J2KK", "B0006J288M", "078881107X", "B00CUDD0C0", "B00000G3AW", "B0002S64UA", "B00005K9OE", "B00003CXQX", "0788810448", "0788807242", "B0002YLCHE", "6301106563", "B00003CWPW", "0788809806", "0788811002", "6304293968", "6304089201", "B0001I55VA", "B00005T7H6", "B00AEFYZU2", "6302484359", "B00000G3AV", "6302409837", "B00007AJLF", "0780619765"], "bought_together": ["6304400225"], "also_viewed": ["6304400225", "6304978286", "6302642248", "6302426200", "6303314015", "6302787068", "6303983812", "6304290888", "0788812807", "B00000J2JA", "078881172X", "0788812440", "6303929338", "6304089767", "0788802194", "B00005KARD", "B0007KTBIU", "B000035Z2S", "6302320402", "0788811002", "6303534422", "155890641X", "6302158095", "0788805533", "B0006J288M", "6300275310", "6304401132", "6300274268", "B00AO5ZP2Y", "B000E5KQPA", "6304100507", "6301792734", "6305950547", "B0002S64UA", "6300274608", "6305940932", "B00004R99H", "6304500831", "6305229449", "B0081VMY3G", "6301991311", "6304400551", "6302526574", "B0009OUAZW", "B00000ICHA", "6302961572", "B0012RLXBU", "B00004R996", "1558906150", "6305319138", "B00004R99N", "6301017102", "6302178924", "B001PK47GC", "0788806270", "B00004R99A", "B00005JL95", "6304400381", "B00005K9OA", "6302794331"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 121706}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.99, "brand": "", "asin": "078880720X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510F6VK2XAL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Spirit of Mickey [VHS]"}

{"description": "Do you know anyone who hasn't seen this movie? A box-office smash when released in 1993, this spectacular update of the popular 1960s TV series stars Harrison Ford as a surgeon wrongly accused of the murder of his wife. He escapes from a prison transport bus (in one of the most spectacular stunt-action sequences ever filmed) and embarks on a frantic quest for the true killer's identity, while a tenacious U.S. marshal (Tommy Lee Jones, in an Oscar-winning role) remains hot on his trail. Director Andrew Davis hit the big time with this expert display of polished style and escalating suspense, but it's the antagonistic chemistry between Jones and Ford that keeps this thriller cooking to the very end. In roles that seem custom-fit to their screen personas, the two stars maintain a sharply human focus to the grand-scale manhunt, and the intelligent screenplay never resorts to convenient escapes or narrative shortcuts. Equally effective as a thriller and a character study, this is a Hollywood blockbuster that truly deserves its ongoing popularity.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0790736411", "0767803434", "B00AEBB9UK", "B00008K76W", "B002NZK5R8", "B00AEFXT1S", "B000055Y0Y", "B00008K76V", "B004IK30MI", "B002NZK5UU", "B000CEV3M8", "B0045HCJ8K", "B00AEFXYJA", "B00008K76U", "0783225733", "B0045HCJFS", "B000O77SRC", "B000F8DV1M", "B00AEBB9NM", "B00AEFYXJ0", "B000EGDB10", "0800141601", "B002AT8K9W", "6305428115", "B0006GANOQ", "B00026ZG10", "6304711891", "B003ASLJIQ", "6304806434", "B000P0J0EW", "B00AEFY4CG", "B00AEFYF2K", "B000NTMA0Q", "0783240295", "B002NZK5VO", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00015YVDG", "B00AEBB8YW", "0790732238", "B002GIBVVG", "B00004STDN", "B002AT8KAG", "B00AEFXBG6", "B00AEFXVOI", "B000SFOW8I", "B002VWNICC", "B000U1ZV8K", "B002GHHHP6", "B00009WVSL", "B00008G8M4", "B002AS464Q", "B000PHVZNE", "B003AWRMBA", "0790732149", "B0007IO6NM", "B001ECDVJU", "B00AEBBA2W", "0783226888", "B000QUCRB4", "6305213283", "6304765258", "6304765266", "6305133468", "B00005B6JZ", "B002O3Z50G", "B00000G3PA", "B0043X1FNQ", "B000FO0AA6", "B00003CXGV", "B004AOECXI", "B00096S49Y", "B0014C2FX8", "6305236569", "B003ASLJMW", "B0014Z4OMU", "B000P0J0EM", "0790730979", "B0006N2EZ0", "0783222149", "B001LXIDW2", "0783226942", "B00001ZWUS", "B00AEFY5B6", "B00AEFXX9Q", "B00158K0QU", "B003QO8TOQ", "B00AEFXEGS", "0780618548", "0783235070", "B00004XPPG", "B0045HCJGC", "B000FO0A9W", "B0000AOV4I", "B000YCPUWW", "B00177YA1K", "630471193X", "B007SPPANM", "0792844874", "B00081U7HC"], "bought_together": ["0790736411", "0767803434"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000JYW5BE", "B004LWZW4M", "B000UBMSB8", "B0054OGQM8"]}, "price": 17.75, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 201394}, "asin": "079072961X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514VJP0EEHL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Fugitive"}
{"description": "Director William Friedkin was a hot ticket in Hollywood after the success ofThe French Connection, and he turned heads (in more ways than one) when he decided to makeThe Exorcistas his follow-up film. Adapted by William Peter Blatty from hiscontroversial bestseller, this shocking 1973 thriller set an intense and often-copied milestone for screen terror with its unflinching depiction of a young girl (Linda Blair) who is possessed by an evil spirit. Jason Miller and Max von Sydow are perfectly cast as the priests who risk their sanity and their lives to administer the rites of demonic exorcism, and Ellen Burstyn plays Blair's mother, who can only stand by in horror as her daughter's body is wracked by satanic disfiguration. One of the most frightening films ever made,The Exorcistwas mysteriously plagued by troubles during production, and the years have not diminished its capacity to disturb even the most stoical viewers. The film is presented in letterbox format on digital video disc, with a soundtrack that's guaranteed to curdle your blood.

{"description": "Stanley Kubrick'sThe Shiningis less an adaptation of Stephen King's bestselling horror novel than a complete reimagining of it from the inside out. In King's book, the Overlook Hotel is a haunted place that takes possession of its off-season caretaker and provokes him to murderous rage against his wife and young son. Kubrick's movie is an existential Road Runner cartoon (his steadicam scurrying through the hotel's labyrinthine hallways), in which the cavernously empty spaces inside the Overlook mirror the emptiness in the soul of the blocked writer, who's settled in for a long winter's hibernation. As many have pointed out, King's protagonist goes mad, but Kubrick's Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) is Looney Tunes from the moment we meet him--all arching eyebrows and mischievous grin. (Both Nicholson and Shelley Duvall reach new levels of hysteria in their performances, driven to extremes by the director's fanatical demands for take after take after take.)The Shiningis terrifying--but not in the way fans of the novel might expect. When it was redone as a TV miniseries (reportedly because of King's dissatisfaction with the Kubrick film), the famous topiary-animal attack (which was deemed impossible to film in 1980) was there--but the deeper horror was lost. Kubrick'sThe Shininggets under your skin and chills your bones; it stays with you, inhabits you, haunts you. And there's no place to hide...--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300267881", "0790734079", "B00005ATQA", "6302038308", "6300182770", "B0009RRUKW", "0783235607", "0783228317", "B00000J2KZ", "B00004RNAC", "0790736039", "B00023NRSM", "6304508611", "6300182878", "6302921058", "6304509154", "0783216084", "6300214087", "B00004W5UA", "6301427076", "630268644X", "B000003KHS", "B000AMW2TK", "0790700506", "6300181340", "6300214753", "6302054982", "0784011923", "6305363668", "6303686796", "6305095566", "630021639X", "6302822688", "6305576173", "0783246641", "6304994540", "6303953425", "B00004U8PA", "0792158261", "0792100085", "6300213986", "6300189015", "630533577X", "6300214826", "0792846303", "6304288433", "6300147630", "0792842111", "B000007OY0", "0790741512", "6302158176", "0792846311", "6300183416", "0800103106", "B000005PFL", "6300183211", "0790733927", "6301666569", "6301871952", "0767825411", "630339406X", "6303109950", "6300216500", "6300214192", "6300262731", "6303257674", "6304214502", "630018627X", "6300214311", "1558807381", "0792839234", "0767819187", "B00005B238", "0790731975", "6303579388", "B000059HFB", "6302798450", "B00000FZCU", "6303651461", "6303566391", "6302642175", "6301971582", "6300218058", "6301094352", "6300184064", "6300181278", "6304457383", "6300214672", "6300262855", "0800125762", "6303257305"], "bought_together": ["0790734079"], "also_viewed": ["6300147630", "6300182878", "B00005ATQA", "6300189015", "6300267881", "B00023NRSM", "6300213005", "6303953425", "0307743659", "6303148352", "0790734079", "B001AQT0Z4", "6300183211", "0784011923", "B00BBND56G", "0788806270"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 268792}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.0, "brand": "", "asin": "0790705141", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5106FV0S4PL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Shining [VHS]"}

{"description": "After his successful direction of the Broadway hitsBarefoot in the ParkandThe Odd Couple,Mike Nichols made his filmmaking debut with this outstanding and still-powerful screen adaptation (by Ernest Lehman) of Edward Albee's taboo-shattering play. In their fourth film together (and by far their finest), Richard Burton and Oscar winner Elizabeth Taylor play a New England couple whose marriage hangs by a thin thread of self-deception, vicious verbal jousting, and embittered mutual need. George Segal and Sandy Dennis (who also won an Oscar) play the younger, unsuspecting couple who awkwardly witness the devastating rivalry of their hosts. Handling adult themes with intelligence and forceful dramatic impact, this was the film that finally shattered Hollywood's self-censoring Production Code with commercially successful results. The DVD features an insightful commentary track by Haskell Wexler, whose black-and-white cinematography deservedly won an Academy Award.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000EBD9T4", "B004XKVP7K", "B00004TWZH", "B0045HCJ8U", "B00004TX2E", "B000EBD9TE", "B00000JL7T", "B008BFSMBA", "B00003CXBZ", "0451218590", "B00006RCO1", "B001KXZGO6", "B00007L4MV", "B00008MTW2", "0767827902", "B0045HCJ08", "B00003CXBU", "B00027JYNK", "B0007US7FI", "B0000549B1", "B00BQ7GU1Y", "B0009NZ2MO", "B001LPWGGY", "B00AEBB89C", "B000KHI2FS", "B000EBD9U8", "B0010YSD7W", "B000OE33MO", "B0009S4IKQ", "B008SAPCAM", "B00079Z9VO", "B006FE83UE", "B0087ZG7R0", "B00027JYLM", "B000CNESU8", "B000BZISSU", "B00AEFXN9G", "B00AEFYSWM", "B00AEFYNG8", "0792833287", "B00007KQA2", "B0001HAINQ", "B0010YVCI4", "B0049985XW", "B00007G1WH", "0780020707", "B009NYF2GQ", "B000TXP56C", "B0050FXDDQ", "B004FQX5B6", "B0002B15ZG", "B000I2JDFI", "B00006RCO2", "B0087ZG7OI", "B00005JKF6", "B000XJD34I", "B00AEFY9GW", "B00569I56Q", "B0008ENHTO", "B008ALNQDY", "B000063K2Q", "B00AEFXD1O", "B001GUYAZY", "B004H83IFU", "B00AEBBA9U", "B00007ELDP", "B00871C09S", "B000068TPG", "B002D755A8", "B00005PJ6W", "B00005JKG9", "B00004XPPK", "B000ERVKJY", "6305081034", "6304907729", "B00009NHC5", "B001D8W7EU", "B00J3CTVXI", "B003LMPKSQ", "B004GJYR7I", "B003XMKMVE", "B00AKGG5WG", "B000UJ48VI", "B00AEBB932", "B000EU1Q1I", "B000MGBLHS", "B00K6D1S7A", "B003O7I6SE", "B00005RDRP", "B0008ENIAC", "B000EHQU0S", "B000KGGJ1I", "B0045HCJQW", "B000BYA4HE", "B0007WRT4Q", "B000055Y0X", "B0045HCJS0", "B000059XTI", "B0007US7EY", "B000F7CEC0"], "bought_together": ["B000EBD9T4", "B0045HCJ8U"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00004TWZH", "B0045HCJ8U", "B002M2Z3BA", "B000EBD9T4"]}, "price": 25.0, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 147968}, "asin": "0790732254", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5183CT06SGL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"}
{"description": "One of the key movies of the 1970s, when exciting, groundbreaking, personal films were still being made in Hollywood, Milos Forman'sOne Flew over the Cuckoo's Nestemphasized the humanistic story at the heart of Ken Kesey's more hallucinogenic novel. Jack Nicholson was born to play the part of Randle Patrick McMurphy, the rebellious inmate of a psychiatric hospital who fights back against the authorities' cold attitudes of institutional superiority, as personified by Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher). It's the classic antiestablishment tale of one man asserting his individuality in the face of a repressive, conformist system--and it works on every level. Forman populates his film with memorably eccentric faces, and gets such freshly detailed and spontaneous work from his ensemble that the picture sometimes feels like a documentary. Unlike a lot of films pitched at the &quot;youth culture&quot; of the 1970s,One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nestreally hasn't dated a bit, because the qualities of human nature that Forman captures--playfulness, courage, inspiration, pride, stubbornness--are universal and timeless. The film swept the Academy Awards for 1976, winning in all the major categories (picture, director, actor, actress, screenplay) for the first time since Frank Capra'sIt Happened One Nightin 1931.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002VWNIDG", "B000RTB0R6", "B006TTC5HC", "B000FVQLQQ", "B000P0J0EW", "0767830555", "B0043X1FL8", "B00003CWQR", "B004SIP7ZS", "B003ELKNH2", "B0006GAOJA", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00AEFXN9G", "0767811100", "0792833287", "B004SIP95G", "B0000YEEGM", "B00079Z9VO", "0451163966", "B00AEFYSWM", "B000P0J09M", "B008MIMWP8", "B000EHQU0S", "B006FE83UE", "B000M341QE", "B00AEFXESQ", "B00002VWE0", "B004SIP8ZM", "B002VWNIAY", "B00009W5CA", "0764586629", "B000ZM1MGE", "B00011CZRE", "B000P0J09C", "B0008ENHUI", "B00005V9HH", "B0019L770A", "B0019L21GA", "B00AEBB9CS", "B0050FXDDQ", "B000CNESTE", "B0006GANN2", "B000LP6KNU", "B000P0J0EM", "B00000IQV7", "B000055Y0X", "B00001ZWUS", "079073219X", "B0019UGYK0", "079284646X", "B00AEBB9F0", "B003ASLJO0", "B000A7DVR2", "B00AEBB9FA", "B0002B15ZG", "B004U7MR3M", "B000YAF4MA", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00066FBQG", "B00005JKIS", "6305144168", "B004SIP7TE", "B002ZG980U", "B00005ATQB", "B0045HCJ94", "0783229526", "B000A3XY5A", "B000093FLA", "B00026ZD04", "B004L9GMBC", "B0000DI87S", "B00006RCO1", "B0007PALZ2", "B0000JBALO", "B004IFYMYI", "B007N31YH0", "B000P0J0D8", "B000H4JH7Q", "B00B0U2SFE", "0792846443", "B007D0FVRM", "B000022TSY", "B0087ZG7UW", "B0002234LS", "B0045HCJ9E", "B0000A02TZ", "B001GD6VTE", "B00AEFYRP0", "0784011710", "B00009AOAZ", "B00005JLSB", "B000Q678OO", "0792838408", "6305882592", "B003LMPKSQ", "B00005MEOU", "B00AEFYSL8", "B0057ZAA6W", "B001AEF6BI", "B000HC2LHG"], "bought_together": ["B002VWNIDG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000P0J0EW", "0451163966", "B006TTC5HC", "B00AEFY0F2"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 40218}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.24, "brand": "WARNER STUDIOS", "asin": "0790732181", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51pJoIlXFbL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"}
{"description": "Twisterwas a mega-million-dollar blockbuster--helmed by a director (Dutchman Jan de Bont) hot off another scorcher hit (Speed)--that flaunted state-of-the-art digital effects and featured a popular leading actress (Helen Hunt) who would win an Academy Award for her next film (As Good As It Gets). But ask anybody who's seen it and they'll tell you who the real star ofTwisteris: the cow. Not to give anything away, but the cow is one of those inspired little touches (like, say, Bronson Pinchot's career-making cameo inBeverly Hills Cop) that adds a touch of personality to a gigantic Hollywood production. The story is blown out the window after an impressive prologue in which Hunt's character, as a little girl, witnesses her daddy being sucked into a tornado. Basically, Hunt and Bill Paxton are thrill-seeking meteorologists chasing twisters in order to study them (and help warn people of them, of course) with a new technology they've developed. If you thought the Kansas tornado inThe Wizard of Ozwas every bit as scary as the Wicked Witch of the West, then this may be the movie for you.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783225547", "B00E8G5HQE", "B00008G8M4", "B0002V7OI8", "B00000G3PA", "B00005JMXX", "B000P0J0C4", "B0006GANOQ", "B002GIBVVG", "B00AEFXPSK", "6304806434", "B001OFM2TC", "B0045HCJFS", "B0057RCFQS", "0783225733", "B00AEFXT1S", "B000N4RAS8", "B000P0J09W", "6304711891", "B00004Z4WR", "B007STBUHI", "B007SPPANM", "B00E8G5HZ0", "B001OQCV2E", "B0013BM63O", "B00AEFXPMG", "B000QUCRB4", "6305236569", "B000EHSVPK", "B002GHHHKQ", "B000EGDB10", "B00026ZG10", "B000QUU4LY", "B00AEFY4CG", "0800195175", "B001LXIDW2", "0790732149", "1558908315", "B00177YA1K", "B0007PLLBU", "B00003CXFV", "B00081U7HC", "6305212112", "1603800875", "B000JYW5BE", "B0068FZ0O2", "0783235070", "B00003CXTG", "B000FO0AA6", "B000ETRA5U", "B00005JN5E", "B001LXIDVS", "B006VRRGNK", "B0068FZ0GK", "B0013FDM7E", "B00003CXSM", "B00004XPPG", "B000CEV3M8", "6304765266", "B001LXIDVI", "B000QUCQX8", "B000QQLVPQ", "B00393SG1U", "0790730979", "B00AEFXE9U", "B00AEFXXMI", "B000EHSVNW", "0767803434", "B004AOECXI", "B000GRUMPU", "B001ECDVK4", "630471193X", "B00008WFU4", "B005QW98NM", "B000P0J0EW", "B00AEBB8NS", "B000SFOW8I", "B00AEFYW64", "B002NZK5V4", "B00AEFY6PQ", "B00008G6E8", "B0045HCJT4", "0783223609", "B00000IQC4", "B00005ATZT", "B00008WFU5", "B00008K76U", "B00AEFY5TI", "B0006FYOTC", "B007IUEE0C", "B00AEFY0F2", "B0002CHK1S", "0783225504", "B001CRC4DG", "B00407PO3W", "B002XUBDRY", "B0000844I8", "0800177258", "B00005JNTI"], "bought_together": ["B00008G8M4", "B00000G3PA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00634MLO0", "B00008G8M4", "B005LAIIPS", "0783225733"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 91188}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 13.95, "brand": "", "asin": "0790729636", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GW5RZP9SL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Twister"}

A high-wattage star vehicle as only Hollywood can make,The Bodyguardstars Houston as a pop-music diva (nowthere'sa stretch) and Kevin Costner as the stern bodyguard who is assigned to protect her after the singer receives some nasty death threats. Pop star and bodyguard don't hit it off at first, but they wear down each others' defenses, and before long Houston is baring her tonsils with a rousing rendition of the Dolly Parton chestnut &quot;I Will Always Love You.&quot; The film, written by Lawrence Kasden, was originally intended for Steve McQueen, but the script languished for years before Houston took an interest in the project. A proposed sequel would potentially have starred Costner and Princess Diana, until Diana's tragic death precluded that possibility.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEFY4CG", "B000002VMD", "B000065V3J", "B00066FAVW", "B00081U7HC", "B0000DIXDR", "B002NZK5TQ", "B004AOECXI", "B002VWNID6", "B00AEBB9NM", "0792844874", "B000KF0GWW", "B00AEFYRP0", "B00009WVSL", "B00AEFY5TI", "B008Y1YJN6", "0767817729", "6305428409", "B001ECDVK4", "B00AEFXZ1C", "B000765IJK", "B009J2VR3Y", "B000P0J0EM", "B003AWRM9M", "B0045HCJJ4", "B0002WZTOI", "B00066FAC6", "6304806434", "B00004ST9Q", "1558908315", "B00005B6JZ", "B002GHHHHO", "B000683VI4", "B0068FZ0GK", "B00AEFXZJE", "B00011CZRE", "B00AEFY0F2", "6301971345", "B0068FZ0O2", "B0000TANUI", "B001ILFUBE", "B00005ATZT", "B000E6ESI0", "B003UEYBPI", "B00AEFXX9Q", "078324021X", "B003ASLJIQ", "B000P0J0EW", "B007SPPANM", "B000YAF4Q6", "B000ARXF96", "B000P0J092", "B00066FAQW", "B000AP04FG", "B00AEBB9IM", "B000YDBPAM", "B000E5N6LG", "B00004STUL", "B003ASLJQI", "6304765266", "B00B83ROIE", "B003ASLJK4", "B00AMEZDJW", "B00AEFXP8K", "0790730979", "B003Y5H4ZC", "B003Y5H58S", "6305133468", "B00AEBB8NS", "B002AT8KD8", "B0000B1OFL", "B002O3Z50G", "B0010YSD8Q", "B00AEBB8YW", "B0000524E5", "B000E5N684", "B00004WG2F", "B000065V3H", "076780676X", "B00AEFXT1S", "B000P0J0BK", "B0007PLLBU", "B00AEFYG3S", "B000BITV9W", "0767803434", "B000FI8MPW", "B0001MMGC2", "B000053VB4", "B000JYW5B4", "B00006HAWN", "B001LMAK88", "0062238396", "6304711891", "B002VWNIBI", "B004AOECTC", "B000FWHW7C", "B00AEFXTKO", "B00005JKWX", "B002NZK5VO", "0783225504"], "bought_together": ["B00AEFY4CG", "B00081U7HC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AEFY4CG", "B002U4UYYQ", "B004AOECXI", "B0009HLD4Q"]}, "price": 22.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 44679}, "asin": "0790729709", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51BN0KS0T0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Bodyguard (Full Screen Edition)"}
{"description": "A favorite film of some of the world's greatest filmmakers, including Martin Scorsese and Steven Spielberg, John Ford'sThe Searchershas earned its place in the legacy of great American films for a variety of reasons. Perhaps most notably, it's the definitive role for John Wayne as an icon of the classic Western--the hero (or antihero) who must stand alone according to the unwritten code of the West. The story takes place in Texas in 1868; Wayne plays Ethan Edwards, a Confederate veteran who visits his brother and sister-in-law at their ranch and is horrified when they are killed by marauding Comanches. Ethan's search for a surviving niece (played by young Natalie Wood) becomes an all-consuming obsession. With the help of a family friend (Jeffrey Hunter) who is himself part Cherokee, Ethan hits the trail on a five-year quest for revenge. At the peak of his masterful talent, director Ford crafts this classic tale as an embittered examination of racism and blind hatred, provoking Wayne to give one of the best performances of his career. As with many of Ford's classic Westerns,The Searchersmust contend with revisionism in its stereotypical treatment of \"savage\" Native Americans, and the film's visual beauty (the final shot is one of the great images in all of Western culture) is compromised by some uneven performances and stilted dialogue. Still, this is undeniably one of the greatest Westerns ever made.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300268470", "630197705X", "0792106989", "6301325508", "0782008348", "6303057225", "6300181588", "6300268799", "0792102320", "6301797922", "6301802330", "6303192254", "0792838556", "6301805518", "6304071876", "6301798759", "6300184951", "6300269884", "6300267830", "1555265952", "6300181715", "0792107128", "6303599052", "6300208281", "0783221347", "B00004RFFA", "6304457308", "6304457278", "079284517X", "6301977165", "6300268748", "B000051S3Z", "B001E419N8", "B000M7BEPQ", "B000GX4476", "0792110188", "6301628454", "6300988473", "0800132009", "B000059HGY", "6301805615", "B00004WZR1", "6301670159", "0792107683", "630310374X", "0783235607", "6303942830", "6302884438", "6305237115", "630150528X", "0792834879", "0790743213", "0783235593", "6304259131", "6301798503", "630018224X", "6302130379", "B000006N70", "6304935811"], "also_viewed": ["6303599052", "6303168507", "6300269884", "6301802330", "0792106989"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 293111}, "asin": "0790736918", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51G79RSPRAL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Searchers [VHS]"}
{"description": "In a time when it seems that every other movie makes some claim to being a film noir,L.A. Confidentialis the real thing--a gritty, sordid tale of sex, scandal, betrayal, and corruption of all sorts (police, political, press--and, of course, very personal) in 1940s Hollywood. The Oscar-winning screenplay is actually based on several titles in James Ellroy's series of chronological thriller novels (including the title volume,The Big Nowhere, andWhite Jazz)--a compelling blend of L.A. history and pulp fiction that has earned it comparisons to the greatest of all Technicolor noir films,Chinatown. Kim Basinger richly deserved her Supporting Actress Oscar for her portrayal of a conflicted femme fatale; unfortunately, her male costars are so uniformly fine that they may have canceled each other out with the Academy voters: Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce, Kevin Spacey, and James Cromwell play LAPD officers of varying stripes. Pearce's character is a particularly intriguing study in Hollywood amorality and ambition, a strait-laced &quot;hero&quot; (and son of a departmental legend) whose career goals outweigh all other moral, ethical, and legal considerations. If he's a good guy, it's only because he sees it as the quickest route to a promotion.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005V9HH", "B00AEFXN9G", "B000K2UVZM", "B0002V7O5Q", "B00AEFXESQ", "B00009W5CA", "B00AEBB9NM", "B00003CXZ4", "B00AEBB9N2", "B000KWZ7JC", "B000HC2LHG", "B00011CZRE", "0446674249", "0767830555", "B0006GANN2", "B00005JKJA", "B004SIP95G", "B00HJRVWM2", "B000055Y0Y", "B00AEFY5B6", "B000P0J0EW", "B005S9ELVC", "0767802519", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00005PJ8T", "B000P0J0AG", "B00005ATZT", "B002DU39GW", "B003AWRMCE", "6304698747", "B0006GAOJA", "6305308837", "B003ELKNH2", "B004FQX5B6", "0790732149", "B004U7MR14", "B000LP6KNU", "B000FFJYA2", "B000C20VRS", "B00005AUK9", "B0002XNT12", "B003XURDAY", "B00079Z9VO", "B0002HOERG", "B00008975Z", "B000O77SRC", "B00AEFYUQQ", "B000A2UBN4", "B0000AM6JI", "B00BTYOYG2", "B000M341QE", "B0045HCJ9E", "B003ASLJQ8", "B002VWNIAY", "B004SIP7TE", "079284646X", "B004AOECXI", "B000063US2", "B002NZK5VO", "B00005JLRE", "B0087ZG7OI", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00003CWUX", "B0010YSD8Q", "B00006FMAT", "B000P0J09M", "B000A7DVR2", "6305262268", "B003L20IG0", "B00066FBQG", "B00AEBB95K", "B004SIP7F8", "B000GIW9I2", "6305999872", "0767817710", "B000XR9L50", "B00080ZG10", "B00005BCKF", "B000PAAJZ6", "B002T9H2LA", "B000GFLKF8", "B00LG6YEKE", "B000LC55F2", "6305263248", "B0087ZG7R0", "B000CEXEWA", "6305161879", "B000P0J0D8", "0792833279", "B00008OE4W", "B00004XPPB", "B007UW9W5U", "B0045HCJIK", "B00005JMEW", "B00AEBB9UK", "6305428115", "B004SIP9Z6", "B004SIP7ZS", "B0000DI87S", "B00B0U2SFE"], "bought_together": ["B00005V9HH", "B00009W5CA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00GHJ1YUI", "B00005V9HH", "B007NPYP24", "B00003CWL6"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 51121}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.89, "brand": "", "asin": "0790734850", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51R182THC0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "L.A.

{"description": "Although it eventually runs out of smart ideas and resorts to a typically explosive finale, this above-average thriller rises above its formulaic limitations on the strength of powerful performances by Samuel L. Jackson and Kevin Spacey. Both play Chicago police negotiators with hotshot reputations, but when Jackson's character finds himself falsely accused of embezzling funds from a police pension fund, he's so thoroughly framed that he must take extreme measures to prove his innocence. He takes hostages in police headquarters to buy time and plan his strategy, demanding that Spacey be brought in to mediate with him as an army of cops threatens to attack, and a media circus ensues. Both negotiators know how to get into the other man's thoughts, and this intellectual showdown allows both Spacey and Jackson to ignite the screen with a burst of volatile intensity. Director F. Gary Gray is disadvantaged by an otherwise predictable screenplay, but he has a knack for building suspense and is generous to a fine supporting cast, including Paul Giamatti as one of Jackson's high-strung hostages, and the late J.T.

{"description": "The Band Wagon(1953) marked the culmination of a series of near-autobiographical pictures Fred Astaire made for MGM following his return from premature retirement in the late '40s. Astaire plays Tony Hunter, a fading film star (his big hit:Flying Down to Panama) who decides to return to his former glory, the Broadway stage. (In 1931, Astaire had starred on Broadway with sister Adele inThe Band Wagon, a revue that lent some of its songs to this film.) His playwright-songwriter friends (Nanette Fabray and Oscar Levant) hook him up with Broadway's hottest director, Jeffrey Cordova (a nicely hammy Jack Buchanan), who proves that the \"new\" theater traditions can be an awkward fit with the old. Hunter also finds himself at odds with his prima ballerina leading lady (Cyd Charisse), one of his chief worries being that she seems a little tall. Along the way, producer Arthur Freed, director Vincente Minnelli, choreographer Michael Kidd, and songwriters Howard Dietz and Arthur Schwartz treat us to some quintessential MGM numbers: Astaire's solo ode \"By Myself,\" the flashy arcade romp \"A Shine on Your Shoes,\" Astaire and Charisse's romantic duet \"Dancing in the Dark,\" the faux-German drinking song \"I Love Louisa,\" the manic trio \"Triplets\" (with Astaire, Fabray, and Buchanan in matching baby outfits), the Mickey Spillane-esque \"Girl Hunt Ballet,\" and the classic show-biz anthem \"That's Entertainment.\" Even if its ending and obligatory romance fall a little flat,The Band Wagonis one of the classic backstage musicals, a grandiose MGM spectacle that also manages to poke some fun at how grandiose MGM pictures had become.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301977343", "6301327853", "0792837533", "0780630157", "6302363276", "6304151306", "6305282927", "0792837630", "6303494390", "6302363292", "0783221347", "B0009J2F1E", "6301587375", "0792840836", "0792840844", "B00005LMA7", "6300183513", "B000BWIZRW", "B00000F3QZ", "6301969014", "0790743213", "6304039530", "6300215512", "6301967739"], "bought_together": ["6301977343"]}, "price": 5.95, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 386533}, "asin": "0790749467", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RDT0WX82L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Band Wagon [VHS]"}

{"description": "The third installment in the cinematic incarnation of Tom Clancy's CIA analyst Jack Ryan and the second starring Harrison Ford, this follow-up toPatriot Gamesis a more complex, rewarding, and bolder film than its predecessor. Ford returns as Ryan, this time embroiled in a failed White House bid to wipe out a Colombian drug cartel and cover up the mess. The script, by Clancy and John Milius (Red Dawn), has an air of true adventure about it as Ryan places himself in harm's way to extract covert soldiers abandoned in a Latin American jungle. There are a couple of remarkable set pieces expertly handled byPatriot Gamesdirector Phillip Noyce, especially a shocking scene involving an ambush on Ryan's car in an alley. The supporting cast is superb, including Willem Dafoe as the soldiers' leader, Henry Czerny as Ryan's enemy at the CIA, Joaquim de Almeida as a smooth-talking villain, Ann Magnuson as an unwitting confederate in international crime, and James Earl Jones as Ryan's dying boss. The DVD release has a widescreen presentation, theatrical trailer, closed captioning, optional French soundtrack, and optional Spanish subtitles.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["079212569X", "0792116887", "6304259131", "0800199421", "B00006IUNT", "6304618344", "0800125762", "0790748169", "6300214567", "6303020089", "B00003CXTF", "0783222955", "6304258984", "6300216500", "6303269834", "B00004RVRP", "6305718792", "6300215717", "0792147618", "6303313345", "0800132009", "B00004WIDB", "6305622825", "0783223218", "0792837797", "6302597625", "6303696813", "6303212263", "6305171750", "6302091632", "0790738066", "0800116917", "630150528X", "0790701251", "6304458975", "6300184269", "0790731274", "B00000IO4G", "6300218066", "B0002GTWOM", "B000005PFL", "079073799X", "079213690X", "B000068TSI", "0790731975", "6301208773", "6304457391", "6301888901", "B00000K2SC", "6302909023", "630420065X", "0790744589", "B00005NSYB", "6304214502", "B00004XPQ6", "6301586026", "6300214540", "6302945089", "6304925131", "6304681496", "B00006BS6T", "6300213730", "6304071876", "6301016289", "6303101267", "B00003JRAB", "6302712009", "6303560040", "6302936381", "6305123616", "6301276930", "6304353634", "B00006RCSC", "0800179552", "B00007CVYA", "6301071379", "6303562248", "B00003CXE6", "6303383300", "6300183211", "B000006FNX", "0790733927", "0792839846", "B00003G1FZ", "0792153189", "6303168507"], "bought_together": ["079212569X", "0792116887"], "also_viewed": ["079212569X", "0792116887", "0792134877"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 44869}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 0.73, "brand": "", "asin": "0792133153", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41F397NCBNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Clear And Present Danger [VHS]"}

{"description": "Despite the combined star power in front of and behind the camera,Fat Man and Little Boyis a largely tepid retelling of the history of the Manhattan Project, the atomic testing project that led to the U.S. bombing of Japan during World War II (said bombs were dubbed \"Fat Man\" and \"Little Boy\"). The Nevada-based project is headed by General Leslie R. Groves (a testy Paul  Newman) and scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Dwight Schultz of the TV seriesThe A-Team), who later regretted his cooperation in the project. The problem with the film lies not with the acting, which includes solid performances by Bonnie Bedelia, Laura Dern, John Cusack, and future U.S.  Senator Fred Dalton Thompson, but with the script by director Roland Joff&eacute; and Bruce Robinson (Withnail and Iand Joff&eacute;'sThe Killing Fields). A subject as morally complex as the creation of a supreme weapon requires a strong and thoughtful script, butFat Man and Little Boynever gets further than establishing that indeed, atomic power is something to reckon with. Joseph Sargent's 1989 made-for-TV filmDay One, with Brian Dennehy as Groves and David Straithairn as Oppenheimer, covers the same story with twice the depth and avoids the pitfall of a romantic subplot (Oppenheimer's dalliance with a communist played by Natasha Richardson), which this film stumbles into. Cusack's doomed scientist is actually a combination of two real-life physicists, Harry Daghlian and Louis Slotkin, who died from radiation poisoning, albeit long after V-J Day.--Paul Gaita", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 276128}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.99, "brand": "", "asin": "0792115147", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41GDK2RFYFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Fat Man &amp; Little Boy [VHS]"}

{"description": "One of those movies that helped usher out the era of action films that had plots that made any sense (and also helped reverse the direction of Patrick Swayze's career arc),Road Houseconcerns a handsome, existential bouncer in a rinky-dink honky-tonk who owns both a degree in philosophy and a Mercedes. And that's perhaps the most believable aspect of the whole movie. Swayze stars as Dalton, \"the best bouncer in the business,\" who runs afoul of Wesley (Ben Gazzara), the meanest SOB round these parts, by taking up with his former girlfriend, Doc (Kelly Lynch)--the only woman in town with an IQ approaching double digits, even if she had unfathomably hooked up with such a lowlife. Swayze had complained about being typecast as beefcake when this was made, but that didn't stop him from revealing as much skin as possible--even guys like him, as revealed in a luridly seedy scene in which one of Wesley's goons tells Dalton that he reminds him of the kind of boyfriend he had in prison (albeit in much saltier terms).

{"description": "This was the first James Bond adventure produced after the success ofStar Wars, so it jumped on the sci-fi bandwagon by combining the suave appeal of Agent 007 (once again played by Roger Moore) with enough high-tech hardware and special effects to make Luke Skywalker want to join Her Majesty's Secret Service. After the razzle-dazzle ofThe Spy Who Loved Me, this attempt to latch onto a trend proved to be a case of overkill, even though it brought back the steel-toothed villain Jaws (Richard Kiel) and scored a major hit at the box office. This time Bond is up against a criminal industrialist named Drax (Michel Lonsdale) who wants to control the world from his orbiting space station. In keeping with his well-groomed style, Bond thwarts this maniacal Neo-Hitler's scheme with the help of a beautiful, sleek-figured scientist (played by Lois Chiles with all the vitality of a department-store mannequin). There's a grand-scale climax involving space shuttles and ray guns, but despite the film's popular success, this is one Bond adventure that never quite gets off the launching pad. It's as if the caretakers of the James Bond franchise had forgotten that it's Bond--and not a barrage of gizmos and gadgets (including a land-worthy Venetian gondola)--that fuels the series' success. Despite Moore's passive performance (which Pauline Kael described as &quot;like an office manager who is turning into dead wood but hanging on to collect his pension&quot;),Moonrakerhad no problem attracting an appreciative audience, and there are even a few renegade Bond-philes who consider it one of their favorites.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000RPCK1K", "B000NIBUR6", "B000M53GLS", "B000RPCK24", "B000M53GN6", "B000RPCK1A", "B000RPCK0Q", "B000NDEXPM", "B000NIBUS0", "B001R10BN2", "B000M53GMW", "B000RPCK1U", "B000M53GNG", "B000NIBURQ", "B000M53GM2", "B000NDEXPC", "B00004RG62", "B001EDVNNU", "B000M53GMC", "B00004WEJZ", "B001PPLIEG", "B00AQSN7HE", "B007REV4T8", "B00005JL0I", "B009PN18R2", "B004BR7XLM", "B008YAPQX4", "B000067J15", "B00AZFECBS", "B00006BH8G", "B00AZFECJU", "B009RO9LKK", "B00AZFECL8", "B00000BLFI", "B009L6VWRO", "B000HT3PF6", "B009NUUBBQ", "B001AQT0WW", "B0000BYRO9", "B0001ENZLQ", "B009NUTPAO", "B009NUV0E8", "B0014C2FX8", "B009L6UDUG", "B00008K76U", "B005LAII44", "B00AZMFJYA", "B001U6YI9W", "B00AZFECS6", "B000O599YY", "B00AVWIQZS", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B007STBUHI", "B0045HCJ9O", "B004OB2EYQ", "B003Q6D2B4", "B00005PJ8S", "B004EPYZUS", "B008JFUO72", "1612185452", "B00005ATZT", "B00DZFKNFO", "B0000BYRO7", "B000BZISSU", "B00001U0BN", "B00AEFYENK", "B0014Z4ON4", "B001AQMBIC", "B0000UJL96", "B004L9GMBC", "B001PO6FF4", "B000FO0AA6", "B0000AUHOH", "B00009NHC0", "0792839064", "B000MGTQ7U", "B00005JLRQ", "B001AQO3WO", "0783226039", "B00AEBB8VK", "B00005JKU0", "B0013LL2Z2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000RPCK24", "B000M53GN6", "B001R10BN2", "B000NDEXPM"]}, "price": 11.94, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 283251}, "asin": "0792838033", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/513267YK57L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Moonraker THX Edition"}

{"description": "FutureNightmarecreator andScreamweaver Wes Craven's  film debut is a primitive little production that rises above its cut-rate  production values and hazy, grainy patina via its grimly affecting portrait  of human evil infiltrating a middle-class household. The story is adapted  from Ingmar Bergman'sThe Virgin Spring, but the film has more in  common with Sam Peckinpah'sStraw Dogsas it charts the descent of a  harmless married couple into methodical killers. A quartet of criminals--a  distorted version of the nuclear family--kidnaps a pair of teenage girls and  proceeds to ravage, rape, torture, and finally brutally murder them in the  woods, unwittingly within walking distance of their rural home. The killers  take refuge in the girls' own home, but when the parents discover just who  they are and what they've done, they plot violent retribution.Along with George Romero'sNight of the Living Deadand Tobe Hooper'sTexas Chainsaw Massacre, Craven helped redefine American horror with  this debut--all three movies portray modern society crumbling into madness  and horror. But, unlike his fellow directors, Craven gives his film an  uncomfortable verisimilitude, setting it squarely in the heartland of modern  America. While at times it's awkward and inconsistent, with distracting comic  interludes, his handling of the brutal horror scenes is unsettling, and the  death of the daughter is an unexpectedly quiet and lyrical moment.--Sean  Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792839242", "6302921058", "B00000K0DU", "6300214311", "6300182770", "B00000IQUT"], "also_viewed": ["6302921058"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 475308}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.78, "brand": "", "asin": "079284632X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/512ZWA7XGZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Last House on the Left [VHS]"}

{"description": "Here's a model for adapting a novel into a movie. The bestseller by James Jones, a frank and hard-hitting look at military life, could not possibly be made into a film in 1953 without considerably altering its length and bold subject matter. Yet screenwriter Daniel Taradash and director Fred Zinnemann (both of whom won Oscars for their work) pared it down and cleaned it up, without losing the essential texture of Jones's tapestry. The setting is an army base in Hawaii in 1941. Montgomery Clift, in a superb performance, plays a bugler who refuses to fight for the company boxing team; he has reasons for giving up the sport. His refusal results in harsh treatment from the company commander, whose bored wife (Deborah Kerr) is having an affair with the tough-but-fair sergeant (Burt Lancaster). You remember--the scene with the two of them embracing on the beach, as the surf crashes in. The supporting players are as good as the leads: Frank Sinatra and Donna Reed won Oscars (and Sinatra revitalized his entire career), and Ernest Borgnine entered the gallery of all-time movie villains, as the stockade sergeant who makes Sinatra miserable. Zinnemann's work is efficient but also evocative, capturing the time and place beautifully, the tropical breezes as well as the lazy prewar indulgence. This one is deservedly a classic.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305261296", "6302226899", "6302413435", "6305123616", "079284517X", "6302413400", "0783221347", "0783222955", "B000005PPB", "0800113055", "6301586026", "6303057225", "6300215644", "6303402070", "6300215741", "0790743159", "6301976983", "6302877873", "B0000048YM", "630150528X", "0793910323", "6302000661", "1558807780", "6300216012", "6302120624", "6302842263", "6302700949", "6302360978", "6300246965", "6304111398", "6301628454", "6304291698", "0800132009", "6301578805", "6301706587", "6301975987", "6300216721", "6302593220", "6301670140", "630442972X", "0792107683", "6301670159", "6304359705", "6301955293", "6301798503", "6301976622", "6301599225", "1558808590", "B00000F13M", "6300183890", "6300267865", "0792101448", "6301797957", "6301973232", "0782008348", "6301564456", "0792110269", "6301798732", "B000M5BRX2", "6301969294", "0783235623", "6302484391", "0790743213", "6300215962", "6300147355", "630266232X", "6300182304", "6303282237", "0792841026", "0790733935", "0792837967", "6301959728", "0783236352", "6302779782", "6302640504", "B0000048YO", "6304383169", "6302238331", "6301640667", "6300214826", "6300181421", "6303029027", "6300181340", "6304429274", "0792837096", "6301973259", "6303560040", "6302753198", "6304056915", "0792837630", "6303943004", "6302797713", "0782006779", "6301798759", "6302278929", "6300246868", "630533577X", "0792837649", "6304935811", "0800100816"], "bought_together": ["6305123616"], "also_viewed": ["6304117752", "0783222955", "0783221347", "6303215734", "6304429274"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 203870}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.0, "brand": "", "asin": "0800100832", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4157079C8HL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "From Here to Eternity [VHS]"}
{"description": "If you think Jim Carrey's comedy is an acquired taste, think ofThe Cable Guyas a potent bottle of bittersweet wine. The film has a lingering aftertaste, but it is just a bit too dark, a bit too extreme to invite another serving. On the other hand, you've got to give Carrey some credit for risking his $20-million paycheck (and a big chunk of box-office revenue) on this black comedy. A needy, psychologically unbalanced cable-television installer (Carrey) forces his friendship upon an unsuspecting bachelor (Matthew Broderick) who has just broken up with his fianc&eacute;e. The movie gets edgier and more desperate--and in some respects funnier--as Carrey's cable guy gradually goes crazy. Director Ben Stiller manages to pack some pointed social commentary into the movie's many humorous detours.  Although it was a box-office disappointment,The Cable Guyis nevertheless a daring comedy for those who have had their fill ofAce Ventura.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00003CXE4", "0783235070", "B00081912E", "B00AEBB9SM", "B002BIULKS", "B000P0J06A", "B000BKJ762", "0790732157", "B003PIUIHO", "B001SN78JO", "B0000AKCKI", "B00003CWTL", "B000OYC7BW", "B004H83IJQ", "B000E8N8H0", "B008R65XUQ", "B002BIULL2", "B00AEBBA2C", "630529142X", "B00000K3UU", "B00005JL93", "B00AEFXIUK", "B0000CDRVX", "B006TTC5PY", "B00005NGAY", "B00005JM4Q", "B000ELJAEM", "B00AEFXPG2", "B00003CXPS", "B00AEFYZCU", "155890834X", "B0068FZ0O2", "B000HT386M", "B00009PY3X", "B00005JKNC", "B00005KA6V", "B000PHX5P0", "B00003GPFT", "B00005JMYI", "B004A8ZX3C", "B004H83IM8", "B00003CXO1", "B00005OCJP", "B000068TPB", "B00AEBB9K0", "0792842162", "B00AEFYS2M", "B00024JC4E", "B00177YA1K", "B000FP2OPO", "B0009P42WI", "B00005JMJG", "0783227345", "B000CPH9PM", "B000A3XYIM", "B00AEBB9GY", "B008R65XTC", "B000U1ZV4Y", "B0009HBPN0", "B002ZG971U", "6304806434", "6305161860", "B00AEFY0F2", "B000VXWX7E", "6305428263", "B00AEBB8NI", "B00004TJMW", "B000WZEZGI", "B0006GANPA", "6305433925", "B000068MBS", "B00AEFYIQ8", "B00AEFYPXY", "B000I0RNVQ", "B0016MOV92", "B00000K3U4", "0800195175", "B000067FP8", "B001G5T6GW", "B00E1HIX66", "B000MGBSJE", "B00013RC7K", "B00441GYVA", "B002ZG9800", "B0009ZE9VW", "B0000VD11E", "B0009X761E", "B0015XHQT4", "B000K405CY", "B004P7CMZ0", "B0016MJ6J2", "B00001U0BN", "6304711891", "B00003CXS7", "B000MCH5RM", "6305017115", "B00JHH21AE", "B00000JMOD", "B001AEF6C2"], "bought_together": ["B00003CXE4", "0783235070"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00003CXE4", "0783235070", "0790732157", "B00AEBB9SM"]}, "price": 13.49, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 32844}, "asin": "0800141687", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Q8NQFB21L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Cable Guy"}
{"description": "A U.S. soldier is dead, and military lawyers Lieutenant Daniel Kaffee and Lieutenant Commander JoAnne Galloway want to know who killed him. &quot;You want the truth?&quot; snaps Colonel Jessup (Jack Nicholson). &quot;You can't handle the truth!&quot; Astonishingly, Jack Nicholson's legendary performance as a military tough guy inA Few Good Menreally amounts to a glorified cameo: he's only in a few scenes. But they're killer scenes, and the film has much more to offer. Tom Cruise (Kaffee) shines as a lazy lawyer who rises to the occasion, and Demi Moore (Galloway) gives a command performance. Kevin Bacon, Kiefer Sutherland, J.T. Walsh, and Cuba Gooding Jr. (ofJerry Maguirefame) round out the superb cast. Director Rob Reiner poses important questions about the rights of the powerful and the responsibilities of those just following orders in this classic courtroom drama.", "related": {"also_bought": ["6304259131", "B000007OY0", "6302935148", "0792116887", "B00004WIDB", "6302816629", "6300214222", "6300214567", "6303269834", "6302989787", "0790748169", "0792133153", "B00000K3AN", "6304618344", "080018789X", "6303257844", "0783222955", "6302820448", "6300214540", "6301247485", "6302415853", "6303402348", "630179513X", "6301666569", "6303168507", "6300214826", "6305718792", "B00003CXE6", "6303212379", "B00003JRAB", "079213690X", "B001TODCII", "6301578805", "6304458975", "0800142039", "6300183211", "6300267970", "B00003G1FZ", "630419949X", "6300263673", "6300269043", "B0002GTWOM", "B00329TVQA", "6303908306", "6303020089", "0800132009", "0792841778", "B00008KDHM", "0790751089", "B000006N70", "6301627768", "B00000IO4G", "079212569X", "0783202253", "6303696813", "B00003CXFU", "6304258984", "6302881005", "0800179552", "0792147618", "0783223218", "6304935811", "6303313345", "0800199421", "B0001E7LQG", "6302909023", "0790735423", "0783204914", "630407185X", "0800125789", "6305622825", "0790731274", "6301976061", "6302945089", "6301976983", "6304155972", "0790701251", "0800116917", "6302779278", "0790734516", "6302822688", "0790705141", "0790731975"], "bought_together": ["6304259131", "6302935148"], "also_viewed": ["6304233639", "6300213668", "6305750750", "080010367X", "0792116887", "B000062XM6", "6302935148", "079213690X", "6302415853", "6303824382", "6303402348", "B000005QWI", "B001680M26", "6305169187", "630382790X", "0783225733", "080018789X"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 84448}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 0.99, "brand": "", "asin": "0800125762", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41S81CR5D4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "A Few Good Men [VHS]"}

{"description": "Hit man Martin Q. Blank (John Cusack) is in an awkward situation. Several of them, actually. He's attending his high school reunion on an assignment; he's got a rival hit man (Dan Aykroyd) on his tail; and he's going to have to explain to his old girlfriend (Minnie Driver) why he stood her up on prom night. This amiable black comedy, cowritten by Cusack and directed by Jonathan Demme prot&eacute;g&eacute; George Armitage (Miami Blues), has the feel of Demme'sSomething WildandMarried to the Mob--which is to say its humor is dark and brightly colored at the same time. Cusack and Driver are utterly charming--as is the leading man's sister, Joan, who plays his secretary. (Ms. Cusack received an Oscar nomination for her next role, inIn & Out.) Alan Arkin is also very funny as Martin's psychiatrist.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00003CXGA", "B00009OWJY", "B0015XHQVC", "B004SIP9RO", "B00005JKFA", "B002JOUNE8", "B004YCKKFK", "B000065U1Q", "B00005JPT0", "B000BNX3B4", "B00000IQBW", "B000001FJL", "B00005U5AG", "B00BNH9NCU", "B00008K77D", "B001HVZOB6", "B0013D8LBS", "B000P0I4O4", "B003ASLJQ8", "B000DZ7YN8", "B00AADAK5W", "B004SIP7ZS", "0780618548", "B00003CY5G", "B00014NEZI", "B00008DDXK", "B00AEFXE9U", "B000TJ6PBK", "B002ZG97XI", "B00007AJF8", "0767802519", "B00008EY9G", "6305428239", "6305236569", "B0009X7BDC", "B002FU8IWU", "B007P9HW3M", "B000GGSMC6", "B000065V3H", "B00GHJ1YUI", "B004ZNFTDQ", "B000ELL1SA", "6305428034", "B000093FLA", "B0045HCJFS", "B0015XHQUI", "6304698747", "6305428050", "0783229364", "B00006JDVV", "B000274T94", "B000065V3E", "B00008OE4W", "B000053VB4", "B00016MSV2", "B00005V9I0", "B00005JKBC", "B00AEFYUQQ", "B003ASLJPE", "B009YQJ322", "0767812182", "B0000B1OFL", "B004SIP8LG", "B00008975Z", "B00003CY41", "B0029XFN9Y", "B0049IHX2C", "B00005V4XW", "B00AEFXO8Q", "6305263248", "B00BTYJYOY", "B002AS466O", "0767821513", "6304806434", "B002NZK5R8", "B00AEBB9DW", "B002O3Z4VG", "B0000A02TZ", "B00BTYFWEA", "0792846435", "B004CQZFIU", "B00004XPPB", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B00026ZG10", "B00AG475K8", "B0000A9GHD", "B004WCTLNY", "B002ZG96ZC", "B00DW5IJR6", "B00009Y3PV", "B002WEEYIQ", "B0012KJ0DK", "B0000524E5", "0767817729", "076782153X", "B000PAAJZ6", "B0007IO6NM", "B00AEFXWXI", "B00AG473GE", "B0010YSD8Q"], "bought_together": ["B00003CXGA", "B00005JKFA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00003CXGA", "B000QUU4MI", "B002JOUNE8", "B00005JKFA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 8109}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.99, "brand": "Buena Vista", "asin": "1558908382", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51gX6Vb2znL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Grosse Pointe Blank"}

{"description": "Clever and original, this horror film directed by Steve Miner (Forever Young) stars Julian Sands as a 17th century warlock who escapes the gallows and is transported--along with the witch hunter who brought him to trial (Richard E. Grant)--300 years into the future. Running  loose in contemporary Los Angeles, Sands's supernatural monster sets about reuniting the scattered portions of a Devil's Book that will reveal the true name of God and thus destroy mankind. In a great twist, the last bit of the book is in a very interesting place: the grave of Grant's character, who has enlisted the aid of a woman (Lori Singer) in a hurried effort to stop imminent disaster. Genuinely involving,Warlockis aided immeasurably by sharp performances from the equally eccentric Grant (Withnail and I) and Sands (Naked Lunch). Miner invents his way through a kind of simultaneously new and old horror tale, and the results are taut, fun, and surprising. The DVD release features Spanish and French subtitles, cast and crew information, and 2.0 Dolby surround sound.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0053TWVA0", "B002I41KNC", "B0001ZX0GU", "B00LNBQ8SI", "B00009PY4C", "B00009PY4G", "B000MV8AC2", "B0001Y4M22", "B0001ZX0GK", "B009H3LOGK", "B001W72VPW", "B00IZZDWKM", "B000V4UFZK", "B008YAPR7E", "B000FGFBUS", "B000056WR3", "B00GATP6JA", "B0045HCJKS", "B00000IQC4", "B0000DZTIL", "B0024FAG44", "0783225741", "B00IKM5LXG", "B0000UX5J8", "B0036R92US", "B003PIUINI", "B000RXVNCO", "B00J11U54K", "B000AC7P5Q", "B000FFJZO2", "B0001Z37HM", "B002NN7EY2"], "bought_together": ["B0053TWVA0", "B002I41KNC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0024FAG44", "B0007QS24S", "B000FFJZO2", "B000P0J0A6"]}, "price": 8.42, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 32476}, "asin": "1573624101", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41AP6PX206L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Warlock"}

{"description": "Spanish director Alejandro Amen&aacute;bar grabbed the attention of American audiences with his dreamy thrillerOpen Your Eyes, but he earlier sent shock waves throughout Spain in 1996 with this disturbing debut.Thesisis a quietly creepy psychological thriller about a young college student, &Aacute;ngela (Ana Torrent) investigating the social fascination with sensational violence for her thesis project. In her  search for violent video footage, she stumbles onto what may be a real live  snuff film, a videotape that her professor was watching before his untimely death. With the help of a geeky gore junkie she uncovers a conspiracy that may include her handsome but sinister new boyfriend, her thesis advisor, and even her weirdo partner.

{"description": "When New York theatrical producer Joseph Papp decided to bring  Gilbert and Sullivan to Broadway, he added typically broad, bold strokes to make  their singular operetta format meaningful to 1980s audiences.  InThe  Pirates of Penzance, Papp had a story that offered a mixture of potential action and comedy that was less arcane than other G&S; chestnuts, which Papp's production underlined by playing up its antic conflict between  its hapless, titular pirates and the citizens of Penzance, the Cornish town targeted for plunder.  Adding to the new production's mainstream allure  was the theatrical debut for erstwhile country-rock siren Linda Ronstadt as  the virginal Mabel, along with a plum role for another putative pop  heartthrob, Rex Smith, as the \"good\" pirate, Frederic.Naturally, such amendments piqued complaints from self-appointed G&S; purists, for whom the duo's original satirical edge and theatrical innovation were obscured (if not ossified) by their canon's patina of respectability.  Happily, for the rest of us, Papp's cheeky revisions  are generally on the money, and this 1983 film version preserves them with unusual fidelity.  Instead of opening up his production with location shooting or intricate editing, director Wilford Leach savors the  artifice of its stage sets and hokey, colorful costuming, celebrating the  genre's proud theatrical legacy.The cast, meanwhile, tears into the farcical plot with elan, led by  Kevin Kline as the Pirate King, a role perfect for his skill at lampooning masculine bravado (not to mention his underexposed, generally strong singing).  Broadway veteran George Rose proves the very model of the  modern Major-General Stanley, and Angela Lansbury, added to the film's cast  for marquee value, again shows her mettle as the ditzy maid, Ruth. Ronstadt justifies Papp's gamble, having trained rigorously to meet Sullivan's acrobatic melodies--indeed, this project marked her commitment to grow beyond rock, confirmed with her subsequent  exploration of classic pop with arranger-conductor Nelson Riddle.--Sam Sutherland", "related": {"bought_together": ["B002M2Z3BA"], "also_viewed": ["B00006RCMW", "B000G1ALGQ", "B0029WLJFC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 272675}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.79, "brand": "", "asin": "6300182762", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZBRARF91L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Pirates of Penzance [VHS]"}
{"description": "The peril facing a lone American amid Third World political turmoil is elegantly communicated in this important film from Costa-Gavras (Z), adapted by the director and Donald Stewart from Thomas Hauser's nonfiction book. The key to its power onscreen stems from the decision not to center the action merely on the disappearance of Charles Horman (John Shea), but also on the search for him by his father Ed (Jack Lemmon)--and on Ed's discovery of a son he never knew. The Oscar-winning script flows freely between that search and Charles's earlier experiences in the unnamed country (in the true account, Chile). Providing a link between those two stories is Charles's wife Beth (Sissy Spacek), who follows her father-in-law around a country in chaos, teeming with reckless authority and disinterested American diplomats (epitomized by ace character actor David Clennon). The film, which was nominated for a Best Picture Oscar and won the Cannes Film Festival's top prize, is certainly manipulative, but it works because of its finely detailed human elements. Usually emotionally extroverted, Lemmon gives one of his finest performances playing against that type--here, he's a controlled, intellectual man who learns more about his son, and his country, than he ever dreamed he would.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["630368680X"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 473764}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 24.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6300182738", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41FTK884GEL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Missing [VHS]"}

{"description": "A team of U.S. and Russian scientists travel secretly to China in an attempt to discover the truth behind rumors of a downed U.F.O. Their hope is that the aliens will provide their respective governments with advanced technological information. VIEWER COMMENT: \"This surprisingly surefooted feature is much more about the very Terran Cold War than the coldness of space and Earth-vs-flying-saucers warfare. Starting out as a UFO-spotting pilot's struggle to be believed, the story gains considerable traction as the action shifts to Red territory, and the hero finds himself facing foe more home-grown than ET's. For the first half of the flick, the audience may perceive it as corny, anti-commie fare, and those who enjoy such jingoistic, chauvinistic overkill should be tickled pink. Then, as the movie evolves into more of an enemy-mine, psycho-social study, viewers will realize that there's more to this tale than blustery, red-blooded Americanism. Throughout, the film sustains a steady flow of suspense and excitement, and it tries to deal realistically with scientific pursuits. The relationship between John Ericson and Lois Nettleton develops at a believable pace, and the consistent use of non-English languages by foreign characters gives the story a credibility seldom seen in earlier offerings. The characterizations have depth and are well drawn, and even Dan Duryea's portrayal of a stereotypical all-for-the-cause military man is deeply treaded.\"", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000C20VNM"]}, "price": 18.92, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 745859}, "asin": "6300207854", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/419kN75C0ZL.jpg", "title": "Bamboo Saucer [VHS]"}

{"description": "When Samuel (Lukas Haas), a young Amish boy traveling with his mother Rachel (Kelly McGillis), witnesses the murder of a police officer in a public restroom, he and his mother become the temporary wards of John Book (Harrison Ford), a detective who's been assigned to solve the crime. After suspect lineups and mug-shot books yield nothing, Samuel, in the most memorable scene of the film, recognizes the murderer as a narcotics agent whose picture he sees in the precinct. Once Book realizes that the police chief is in on it, too, he whisks Samuel and Rachel back home to Amish country, where he himself goes into hiding as a plain Amish man. The juxtaposition between the life of the Amish and the violence of inner-city police corruption work surprisingly well for the story, and Kelly McGillis as the falling in love widow gives an almost perfect performance. Directed by Peter Weir, the film is extremely successful in drawing the viewer into its world and, accordingly, is immensely entertaining.

{"description": "After dominating the teen-movie genre for the bulk of the 1980s, writer-producer (and sometimes director) John Hughes proved that he had at least one good movie left in him before squandering his talent on lame comedies throughout the 1990s. LikeThe Breakfast ClubandPretty in Pink,Some Kind of Wonderfultreated its teenaged characters like real people with real feelings, hopes, fears, and desire. Mary Stuart Masterson gives a great performance as a tomboy drummer named Watts who's secretly in love with her best friend, Keith (Eric Stoltz), an aspiring artist who is oblivious to her affection because he's got a crush on Amanda (Lea Thompson), the popular high school beauty. Watts will even go so far as to chauffeur a date for Keith and Amanda, if only to prove--after a lot of patient, emotional anguish--that she's better for Keith than Amanda could ever be. The movie's drama comes from Keith's gradual realization that there's more to love than surface attraction, and Hughes gets extra mileage out of the romantic confusion by allowing Thompson's character to be more than a shallow campus cutie. All three of the leads are good fits in their roles, and this was one of the few teen films of the '80s to add genuine depth to its mainstream appeal. It's one of the few John Hughes movies to stand the test of time.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301008960", "630018403X", "6300214370", "6300263673", "6302814782", "6302862787", "6300214753", "6300184269", "6300268993"], "bought_together": ["6301008960", "6300214370"], "also_viewed": ["B00004TWZK", "B00AEFXXMI", "B00E3QJ7FG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 315546}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.47, "brand": "", "asin": "6300218031", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HHAMC0EML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Some Kind of Wonderful [VHS]"}
{"description": "In the tradition of such obsessively driven directors as Erich von Stroheim and Werner Herzog, Francis Ford Coppola approached the production ofApocalypse Nowas if it were his own epic mission into the heart of darkness. On location in the storm-ravaged Philippines, he quite literally went mad as the project threatened to devour him in a vortex of creative despair, but from this insanity came one of the greatest films ever made. It began as a John Milius screenplay, transposing Joseph Conrad's classic story \"Heart of Darkness\" into the horrors of the Vietnam War, following a battle-weary Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) on a secret upriver mission to find and execute the renegade Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), who has reverted to a state of murderous and mystical insanity. The journey is fraught with danger involving wartime action on epic and intimate scales. One measure of the film's awesome visceral impact is the number of sequences, images, and lines of dialogue that have literally burned themselves into our cinematic consciousness, from the Wagnerian strike of helicopter gunships on a Vietnamese village to the brutal murder of stowaways on a peasant sampan and the unflinching fearlessness of the surfing warrior Lieutenant Colonel Kilgore (Robert Duvall), who speaks lovingly of \"the smell of napalm in the morning.\" Like Herzog'sAguirre: The Wrath of God, this film is the product of genius cast into a pit of hell and emerging, phoenix-like, in triumph. Coppola's obsession (effectively detailed in the riveting documentaryHearts of Darkness, directed by Coppola's wife, Eleanor) informs every scene and every frame, and the result is a film for the ages.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301115430", "630018627X", "0790701251", "6300183211", "6303686796", "6305363668", "079284646X", "6304935811", "0784011923", "6303953425", "0792836510", "6302822688", "B000003KHS", "630021639X", "6304119046", "B00003CXE6", "6302610702", "0792158261", "B000K7VHQE", "6303036570", "6303020089", "6303651488", "0800125762", "B004LWZW9W", "B00000JGEI", "0790705141", "6302360978", "6302415853", "0783107986", "B00005ATQA", "630336568X", "0790731975", "6305095566", "6300216500", "6301662954", "6302921058", "6300246965", "6300182878", "0800100832", "B00005JKEC", "6304286961", "B000062XM6", "0784011575", "630197154X", "B00004TYS8", "B00004WIDB", "6304414099", "0800116917", "6302517036", "0800199421", "6304259131", "0783202253", "6303109950", "6303313345", "B00006C7G9", "0792837312", "6302482712", "6300213986", "6303421563", "6304039549", "B000065U6Q", "B0000A36J1", "6300182770", "B00004CNR5", "6304025831", "6303422020", "0790748169", "0800132009"], "bought_together": ["6301115430", "0790701251"], "also_viewed": ["6303953425", "6305363668", "6305750750", "B00000J2KZ", "6303506291", "6303314015"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 172447}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.75, "brand": "", "asin": "6300214826", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41EFVS37MRL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Apocalypse Now [VHS]"}

Massey is a lettuce farmer, striving for market domination with an ill-fated refrigeration scheme. Having discovered that his presumed-dead mother (Oscar&reg;winner Jo Van Fleet) is a brothel owner in nearby Salinas, Cal convinces her to finance an investment that will restore his father's lost fortune, but neither money nor the tenderness of his brother's fianc&eacute;e (Julie Harris) can assuage Cal's anguished need for paternal acceptance that comes nearly too late.

Created under the wing of producer Francis Ford Coppola, this movie is a bleak vision of a world in which technology, not man, is the ultimate dictator.

Featuring unsettling performances by Robert Duvall, Donald Pleasance, and Maggie McOmie,THX 1138does not attempt to explain how things became this way; rather, it utilizes the alienation of its characters, the stifling white-on-white imagery of its sterilized society, and the claustrophobic, droning sound design to emphasize the dangers of a world reliant on soulless technology.

Oops, turns out she's right. This passes the test of time, as it still gets under your skin. The character development is tight and the story very involving. Not even Freddy Krueger had the ability to scare like tiny McCormack, looking just like a little adult while she literally beats out the competition for a penmanship award. However, director Mervyn LeRoy's hands were tied over the ending, which was changed from the source material--Maxwell Anderson's hit Broadway play.

{"description": "Based upon T.H. White's beloved novel, this Disney-fied version chronicles the tutoring of the Once and Future King, Arthur, as handled by the magician Merlin.Swordwas a portent of things to come, with slapstick upbraiding storytelling, and cultural in-jokes substituting for wonder. But there's much to enjoy here as Merlin shows Newt, the young Arthur, things that will help him become the ruler of the Britons. The transformation sequences, where the boy is turned into a fish, a bird, and a squirrel are vintage Disney. The oft-repeated scene of Merlin battling it out with the mean old Madame Mim still is worth a few chuckles, but it belies the problem with most of the film--the scenes are only there for the chuckles. References by Merlin to television and other items of modern life also mar the generally innocuous landscape. Children will like it, but they won't cherish it.--Keith Simanton", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302178924", "6304500831", "6305319138", "6300274268", "0788812408", "6304401132", "0788812807", "0788802194", "6302320402", "6302642248", "0788806270", "6304978286", "6302526574", "078881172X", "6300274195", "155890641X", "6303983812", "6304400551", "6303314015", "6302961572", "6304290888", "0788805843", "6302787068", "6301390725", "6305229449", "B00003CXQX", "B00004R99N", "6302426200", "6304100507", "6300274608", "B000035Z2S", "6304089767", "6304400225", "6303929338", "6302158095", "B00000ICHA", "0788805533", "B00005JKDQ", "6301991311", "0788803743", "B0000AQZYM", "6305940932", "B00005RDVV", "6303036813", "0788812440", "6305326940", "B00003CX7L", "6304501153", "1558906150", "1558901892", "B00004R996", "6303534422", "B00003CXHR", "B00005T7H6", "6301948106", "0788811002", "B0000524CZ", "B00016JF2W", "B00005JKX3", "B00003CWPW", "6304089201", "B00005JLR1", "6302484359", "B0009SUS4Q", "6304873441", "B00004R99A", "B00003CXG6", "B0000E32WB", "6303486894", "6303939015", "B00004R99I", "6303315305", "0788812181", "B00335EQ0E", "B00005JL95", "6304117752", "B00CTNYLQA", "6303122647", "B00000J2JA", "6304400381", "B00000JS61", "6301752686", "6303206204", "B0002YLCHE", "B00000I7Q3", "6300276554", "630197736X", "B000035Z46", "B00008Y47S", "6304492960", "6304155972", "B00007AJLB", "6303295614", "6303392350", "6300277003", "6304401736", "6303394345", "0790744759", "6303991408"], "bought_together": ["6302178924", "6304500831"], "also_viewed": ["6302178924", "6304500831", "6302642248", "078881172X", "0788812408", "6305319138", "6302320402", "6304400551", "0788802194", "6303983812", "6302787068", "0788812807", "6300274268", "0788805843", "0788806270", "6303314015", "155890641X", "6304978286", "6302426200", "B00004R99N", "6304401132", "6304290888", "B000035Z2S", "6303929338", "6302158095", "6303036813", "6300274195", "6302961572", "6302526574", "B00005JL95", "6304100507", "0788805533", "6304089767", "6305326940", "B0007KTBIU", "B00005RDVV", "6303534422", "6305229449", "6304400225", "6301390725", "B0000AQZYM", "6301991311", "B00003CXQX", "B00003CX7L", "B00003CXHR", "6300274608", "B00005JKDQ", "6305940932", "6304089201", "B00CTNYLQA", "6304873441", "B0000524CZ", "6304501153", "0788812440", "B000035Z46", "6305942285", "6301948106", "B00000ICHA", "B0034GK74G"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 166738}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.28, "brand": "", "asin": "6300275310", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51VHD7VWN3L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Sword in the Stone (Walt Disney Masterpiece Collection) [VHS]"}

{"description": "Tom Hanks was a relatively unknown TV actor with a sitcom as his biggest credit when relatively unknown director Ron Howard (best known for his own sitcom acting) cast him in this surprise hit. It made stars of Hanks, Daryl Hannah, and John Candy and an A-list director out of Howard. Hannah is a mermaid who comes to Manhattan in search of Hanks, the guy she has twice saved from drowning. Hanks runs a business with his lovable blowhard brother (Candy), whose goal in life is to have a letter published inPenthouse. When this perfect woman shows up, Hanks can't believe his luck and plunges into a dizzyingly romantic relationship, unaware of her sea-water secret. But the mermaid needs to soak and unfurl her tail from time to time, which leads to complications, including her capture by the government for scientific study (what else?). Hanks is winningly charming and Hannah is a perfect match in this enjoyably high-spirited comedy, though the biggest laughs belong to Candy.--Marshall Fine", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301569385", "B0000022WA", "6301578805", "6300182908", "B00005RIJ3", "0792844718", "6304779674", "0790700506", "B000056VP3", "0792840836", "0788809806", "6300247236", "6302091632", "6303039456", "6304507348", "B00004TRD5", "6301007867", "6302581907", "6302700949", "6302226899", "6301971426", "6301796535"], "bought_together": ["6301569385"], "also_viewed": ["630339406X"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 279288}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6300275213", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51MPR9MC68L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Splash [VHS]"}

He falls into an affair with her, only to discover that she is married to a seemingly normal guy (Richard Chamberlain)--who also happens to be extremely abusive. But his efforts to extricate her from the marriage, set against the flower-power scene in San Francisco, only frustrate him with her indecisiveness.

{"description": "This 1954 dinosaur brings together two giants of Broadway, Ethel Merman and Irving Berlin, just as their moment was passing forever, to create one last hurrah: a celebration of the glories that were vaudeville. Still, it's hard to imagine that Broadway--or nightclub entertaining, for that matter--was ever  quite this lavish and satisfying. The story centers on a married couple, the Donahues (Dan Dailey and Merman), who live on the road as vaudeville entertainers, and since they have children, begin incorporating the kids into the act. Eventually, the kids grow up to be Donald O'Connor, Mitzi Gaynor, and Johnny Ray, and they begin having interests of their own. Donald's is an ambitious showgirl (Marilyn Monroe), whose standoffish response to his romantic overtures drives him to drink.

Astaire plays a decorated American fighter pilot who's taking some incognito R&R;, but his laissez-faire guise ends up infuriating the young lady he's attracted to (Joan Leslie, a year removed from playing James Cagney's wife inYankee Doodle Dandy).  Leslie was perhaps Astaire's most appealing partner after Rogers, and the two first strike sparks with their smile-inducing song-and-dance duet \"I've Got a Lot in Common with You.\" The score was also distinguished by the introduction of two all-time-classic Harold Arlen-Johnny Mercer tunes, \"My Shining Hour\" and \"One for My Baby (and One More for the Road),\" which Astaire croons atop a bar while dancing and smashing glasses.  Fifteen years later, Frank Sinatra would slow \"One for My Baby\" to a world-weary tempo and make it his own, but the song was written for Astaire.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300209741", "6301975995", "6301423933", "6301965698", "B000006934", "B000H6SXSS"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 345556}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.54, "brand": "", "asin": "6301328175", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51SYS292P7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Sky's the Limit [VHS]"}
{"description": "Assault on Precinct 13, the second feature by John Carpenter (Halloween,Vampires), has a group of cops and convicts joining forces as they're besieged in an all-but-abandoned police station by Street Thunder, a gang armed with automatic weapons and silencers.  The relationships of those holed up in the police station as they try to survive the onslaught form the better part of the movie, borrowing liberally from the films of Howard Hawks, especiallyRio Bravo, to make the point about who's \"good enough\" and who isn't.  The action is taut and shocking for its time (1976).  Street Thunder is more an irrational force, an embodiment  of pure evil, than a clearly motivated group with a political agenda, drawing comparisons withAssault's other main influence, the zombies in George&nbsp;A. Romero'sNight of the Living Dead.  More than an action-exploitation flick (though it more than holds its own on that level),Assault on Precinct 13is a disguised Western with a horror aspect that Carpenter would later work out more rigorously in such films asHalloweenandThe Thing. The DVD is a true Collector's Edition, preserving the film's original Panavision aspect ratio of 2.35:1, and including a fascinating commentary track by John Carpenter.--Jim Gay", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00004Y87O", "B0000AOX0A", "B000AM6OQ2", "B0007W7I4W", "B00AEFYDM2", "B0002CHK1S", "B0024FADBA", "B00003CY6P", "B000QUCQX8", "B0000AOX0F", "6305258287", "078062856X", "B003YDORO0", "B00AEBBADG", "B0002KPHZG", "B0001611DI", "B000E8M0P6", "B00D7AM6M0", "0792843649", "0783228457", "B00319ECCY", "B008CYDD7I", "B002E01MHY", "B00AEFXW8I", "B00005JLJW", "B0002O7XW2", "B00008WJDA", "B001D5C1OO", "B004WMOSKA", "B0002IQLH6", "B004LB5F9U", "B000RPCK2O", "B00005N7Z1", "B000RIWAVW", "B0024FADD8", "B0036R92US", "B00005K3NV", "B00JQYV0B4", "B001J710Y8", "B0052DP1RC", "B0006GANN2", "0792838300", "B00097DY2A", "B003THSXJ6", "B0038SUBEG", "B0021L8UXA", "B00009OWI1", "B00EALTVPA", "B0002C9DK4", "B0001FGBUW", "B0067QPVJ6", "B00I9TDMRM", "B0007ZEOC8", "B000RPCJA2", "B000FFJZO2", "0783230427", "B0009298N4", "B00005KH30", "B000096I9X", "B000IMUYJM", "B0000AOX09", "B0015D20FE", "6304936532", "B003O7I6L6", "B001AGNMFI", "B000TUDBFC", "B003CNQPOC", "B000096I9V", "B00005NSXY", "B0055CP9TU", "B00005LC4Q", "B0013527K2", "B000V6LT6C", "B000GETUDI", "B000S0GYRU", "0792839684", "B00HZMZ2FE", "B005152C9G", "B0008ENHTY", "B00AEFXR8I", "B00AKGG828", "B000T28POC", "B000QQJ3Q0", "B00I099JO6", "B000OPOANO", "B000053VB8", "B00140PKCS", "B00023P4UQ", "B0013D8LAE", "B00005R2IS", "B00023P4SS", "B00C7A8WZQ", "B000063UR5", "B0053TWW36", "B001JV5BIA", "B001JFZ122", "B00I462XF2", "0783241895", "B00GOT11TA", "B000068IEV"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0000AOX0F", "B0000AOX0A", "B00004Y87O", "B000AM6OQ2"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 535233}, "asin": "6301394070", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21RV2AX7HQL.jpg", "title": "Assault On Precinct 13 [DVD]"}
{"description": "Seven years after he earned his first screen credit as the writer ofFast Times at Ridgemont High, formerRolling Stonewriter Cameron Crowe made his directorial debut with this acclaimed romantic comedy starring John Cusack and Ione Skye as unlikely lovers on the cusp of adulthood. The casting is perfect, and Crowe's rookie direction is appropriately unobtrusive, no doubt influenced by his actor-loving, Oscar&reg;-winning mentor, James L. Brooks. But the real strength of Crowe's work is his exceptional writing, his timely grasp of contemporary rhythms and language (he's frequently called \"the voice of a generation\"), and the rich humor and depth of his fully developed characters. InSay Anything...Cusack and Skye play recent high school graduates enjoying one final summer before leaping into a lifetime of adult responsibilities. Lloyd (Cusack) is an aspiring kickboxer with no definite plans; Diane (Skye) is a valedictorian with intentions to further her education in Europe. Together they find unlikely bliss, but there's also turbulence when Diane's father (John Mahoney)--who only wants what's best for his daughter--is charged with fraud and tax evasion. Favoring strong performances over obtrusive visual style, Crowe focuses on his unique characters and the ambitions and fears that define them; the movie's a treasure trove of quiet, often humorous revelations of personality. Lili Taylor and Eric Stoltz score high marks for memorable supporting roles, and Cusack's own sister Joan is perfect in scenes with her onscreen and offscreen brother. A rare romantic comedy that's as funny as it is dramatically honest,Say Anything...marked the arrival of a gifted writer-director who followed up with the underratedSinglesbefore scoring his first box-office smash withJerry Maguire.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300147940", "630018403X", "B000051S41", "6300183467", "6300263673", "6300214370", "0792837207", "6300184269", "6300214753", "B000068MFS", "6300214710"], "bought_together": ["6300147940"], "also_viewed": ["0800109481", "6300213986", "6300214710", "B001AEF6BI", "6300183467", "0790740222", "0767825411", "6300270033"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 257141}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6301412761", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41V8JBQ2E7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Say Anything [VHS]"}

The corn runs high, but so do the spirits; plus, Eve Arden is around to toss in her trademark one-liners. Gene Kelly, as Hayworth's sulky choreographer and part-time boyfriend, stops the movie cold with his brilliant dance alongside his own reflection.

The Garden of Eden motif continues in \"The Peach Orchard,\" while Lucas's ILM special effects group shines in the glorious \"Crows\" segment, in which an art admirer finds himself living within the paintings of Van Gogh (played with concentrated energy by Kurosawa enthusiast Martin Scorsese).

{"description": "Director Bob Clark's charming, touching, and very funny adaptation of humorist Jean Shepherd's nostalgic, autobiographical Yuletide novel,In God We Trust, All Others Pay Cash, remains essential holiday family viewing. Narrated by a man (Shepherd) recalling his childhood, the film looks back at the compulsive efforts of 7-year-old Ralphie (Peter Billingsley) as he tries every means possible to acquire his dream Christmas gift--a Daisy-brand Red Ryder repeating BB carbine with a compass mounted in the stock. Problem is, he lives in a Norman Rockwell-esque Midwestern town in the 1940s, where his parents, teachers, and even Santa Claus all warn Ralphie that \"he'll shoot his eye out.\" Episodic in nature and seen entirely through the eyes of a child, the film offers a wonderful look at the day-to-day eccentricities that grew out of this conservative period. More interestingly, it cleverly captures childhood urgency, where even the most trivial fantasies or objects become immediate life-or-death necessities. While countless family Christmas movies serve up clich&eacute;d situations suffocating with preachy sermons, Clark's acute eye for detail and odd mixture of warmth, satire, and quirky humor are the reasons why so many viewers have rediscovered this after it initially bombed in the theaters. Sentimental without being syrupy, it's a true rarity: a holiday movie that adults and children can enjoy equally, for completely different reasons and regardless of the season.--Dave McCoy", "related": {"also_bought": ["079070546X", "6301969707", "6303215734", "B00005LOUS", "6302091632", "B001E4TDR2", "B00000JS61", "5559477621", "6304209266", "B0002F6BQU", "6304117752", "6304400551", "6303442447", "6302526574", "6304089767", "6302794331", "6301390725", "6305123616", "0788812807", "6302765536", "6303314015", "B00005LL26", "0307142450", "6301404440", "6300215695", "6303122647", "B000YABV7W", "0793941520", "0783215517", "6302503795", "B00004UGAU", "B000003KLW", "0375810331", "B00004VVP8", "6301912810", "6301578805", "B00004RFHF", "6301300394", "6302090873", "B0000D14JV", "6300157601", "B00000JGEK", "B00008X5J8", "6301928458", "B00000JKNL", "6301627768", "0800139151", "B00001IVED", "B00001YX9H", "6304140738", "6301798503", "6303675212", "6300989003", "B00005A1VG", "6302581907", "0767825985", "6300216993", "6301670140", "6301977742"], "bought_together": ["079070546X"], "also_viewed": ["6301969707", "B00001IVED", "B00005LOUS", "6303215734", "B00006HBUC", "6304117752", "6302914469", "6304500831", "6303212379", "6304400225", "6300274268", "6302787068", "155890641X", "B00000JS61", "6302178924", "6304434340", "B00004VVP8", "6304089767", "6302642248", "B0007KTBIU", "B00005LL26", "0788812408", "6304400551", "B0000AQZYM", "6303314015", "6302961572", "B00005JKDQ", "6304718551", "B0002F6BQU", "0783231482", "0792839846", "B000028U3S", "B00006FDMY", "6303123244", "B00003CX7L", "6305123616", "B00003CX8I", "6302320402", "0790719029", "6300213668", "6304143184", "1560395966", "B00005O5ML", "6302503795", "B00000K4ZI", "0788805843", "0790742578", "6303212395", "1560395737", "6303338690", "6302091632", "6304290888", "0790700506", "0790742322", "B00000490M", "B00004TX1W", "6304539274", "B00004RFHF", "6304151306"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 318159}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6301966554", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/512TVV2E0DL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "A Christmas Story [VHS]"}

{"description": "In the entire history of American movies,The Night of the Hunterstands out as the rarest and most exotic of specimens. It is, to say the least, a masterpiece--and not just because it was the only movie directed by flamboyant actor Charles Laughton or the only produced solo screenplay by the legendary critic James Agee (who also cowroteThe African Queen). The truth is, nobody has ever made anything approaching its phantasmagoric, overheated style in which German expressionism, religious hysteria, fairy-tale fantasy (of the Grimm-est variety), and stalker movie are brought together in a furious boil. Like a nightmarish premonition of stalker movies to come,Night of the Huntertells the suspenseful tale of a demented preacher (Robert Mitchum, in a performance that prefigures his memorable villain inCape Fear), who torments a boy and his little sister--even marries their mixed-up mother (Shelley Winters)--because he's certain the kids know where their late bank-robber father hid a stash of stolen money. So dramatic, primal, and unforgettable are its images--the preacher's shadow looming over the children in their bedroom, the magical boat ride down a river whose banks teem with fantastic wildlife, those tattoos of LOVE and HATE on the unholy man's knuckles, the golden locks of a drowned woman waving in the current along with the indigenous plant life in her watery grave--that they're still haunting audiences (and filmmakers) today.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["1558808590", "6301976126", "0784011451", "0792101448", "6304212151", "1558807780", "B000003NDA", "6301966430", "6301491920", "B00000F6MH", "6304366035", "6302226899", "0790743159", "6302413435", "6301586026", "0790741431", "6300208133", "6304429274", "0783217528", "6301797906", "6301798732", "0800100832", "B000GX7MMA", "B000054OW2", "6301977815", "B000056BRF", "B0000048YO", "B001E419N8", "630266232X", "6301978110", "6302968100", "6305237115", "6301564456", "0782008348", "0792115449", "6302353785", "6301964012", "630150528X"], "bought_together": ["1558808590"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 201324}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 18.88, "brand": "", "asin": "6301973232", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/717SP3TYNML._SY300_.gif", "title": "Night of the Hunter [VHS]"}

{"description": "Jerome Kern and Oscar Hammerstein II'sShowboat, based on Edna Ferber's 1926 novel, is a seminal American musical, the first to explore serious themes (most notably racism) and to truly integrate song with story and character. The plot follows three generations of a theatrical Mississippi riverboat family from the 1880s to the 1920s. The 1936 film version, directed by Englishman James Whale (Frankenstein), is probably the one that best captures the spirit its creators intended. First and foremost, it features Paul Robeson as Joe. His indelible rendition of \"Ol' Man River,\" delivered strong, straight, and without bathos, is a stunningly powerful anthem about the plight of African Americans in the United States. (The song is set against a fascinating expressionist montage in 1930s social realist style.) Other standout performances include torch singer Helen Morgan as Julie, the actress banished from the showboat for her \"mixed race\" ancestry. Her \"Bill\" and \"Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man\" are simply sublime. Hattie McDaniel (Gone With the Wind) is her usual outrageous self. Irene Dunne (The Awful Truth) is spunky and delightful as Magnolia Ravenal. Her most endearing moment occurs early in the film when she leads the company in a funky cakewalk, swinging her hips with joyful abandon. (She also does a number in blackface!) When Dunne and the narrative leave the riverboat for the big bad city, fame, and heartbreak, the movie loses much of its snap and substance and descends into rather conventional melodrama.

{"description": "Lance Henriksen plays Torquemada, the Grand Inquisitor of the infamous Spanish Inquisition, which is in full swing when THE PIT AND THE PENDULUM begins. The heretic-burning fires of the Auto da f are raging all across Spain, the people live in fear, and no one dares speak a word against Torquemada and the Inquisition. But when a baker's wife tries to stop a woman from being burned alive, she is arrested and brought before the evil Torquemada. The mad dictator accuses her of being a witch and commands that she be put on trial, tortured into a confession, and then burned at the stake. The beautiful woman can only hope that her husband will rescue her before she is killed. Director Stuart Gordon offers up another smart, ambitious horror film in THE PIT AND THE PENDULUM, which is loosely based on the classic Edgar Allan Poe story. Resisting obvious horror film tropes, Gordon laces his film with a more internal brand of horror, focusing on the tortures of the soul and the evil that men do to themselves as well as others. Henriksen is chilling as the half-crazed Torquemada, creating a character who has been twisted by the conflicting forces of devotion to God, earthly lust, and ambitions of power. Excellent acting, a well-crafted script, and good production design make THE PIT AND THE PENDULUM a unique horror film, typical of Gordon's work.", "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 80213}, "asin": "6302054257", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21EWBSAKVVL.jpg", "title": "Pit &amp; the Pendulum [VHS]"}

{"description": "Now and forever a favorite among kids, this 1990 comedy written by John Hughes (The Breakfast Club) and directed by Chris Columbus (Mrs. Doubtfire) ushered Macaulay Culkin onto the screen as a troubled 8-year-old who doesn't comfortably mesh with his large family. He's forced to grow a little after being accidentally left behind when his folks and siblings fly off to Paris. A good-looking boy, Culkin lights up the screen during several funny sequences, the most famous of which finds him screaming for joy when he realizes he's unsupervised in his own house. A bit wooden with dialogue, the then-little star's voice could grate on the nerves (especially in long, wise-child passages of pure bromide), but he unquestionably carries the film. Billie Bird and John Candy show up as two of the interesting strangers Culkin's character meets. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern are entertainingly cartoonish as thieves, but the ensuing violence once the little hero decides to keep them out of his house is over-the-top.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302765536", "6304932553", "B0000A02WC", "0767825411", "6300214753", "6303314015", "079070546X", "B00000490M", "B0000048S1", "6303049079", "6303506291", "B00000JKNP", "630442972X", "6300269639", "6302824729", "6301570723", "0784011923", "6304117752", "6303442447", "B00005JKDQ", "B0000AQZYM", "6302914469", "B00005B6ND", "6300263673", "6304089767", "0788812408", "6300183181", "6303344224", "B00000JGEI", "6305814694", "6301792734", "0783216084", "0790731436", "6303148352", "6302787068", "6304209266", "6303215734", "630018403X", "6300213668", "B00005LOUS", "B0002F6BQU", "6304500831", "B00006G8LB", "6301969707", "B000641D2Y", "6303269966", "6304030959", "630179513X", "6302705517", "0790742322", "6302794331", "B000059XY5", "078881172X", "6303338690", "155890641X", "6302526574", "6303446590", "6303540082", "6301827732", "6302374189", "6303236863", "0800196767", "6301569385", "B00008X5J8", "6302968143", "6300215814", "B00000JS61", "6301966988", "B00003CX7L", "6304416415", "6302178924", "B000MUANT6", "080013558X", "B0000BWVBD", "B00008DZ83", "6302518393", "B000TJBN6W", "6304118937", "6300183467", "6304291698", "6302453356", "6300214370", "6300214710", "6303168957", "0793941520", "B00000F8J1", "6303109918", "6303929680", "0792133153", "B00023BLXA", "6304093381", "B000005PFL", "B000R3KOWE", "6302409365", "6303347657", "6305537798", "6303212263", "B00000GUNY", "0780623711"], "bought_together": ["6302765536", "6304932553"], "also_viewed": ["0767825411", "6302765536", "6304932553", "0788812408", "B00006CXK5", "6302426200", "6303212379", "6303314015", "6302453356", "B001DDBD5E", "6301404440", "B0007KTBIU", "6301792734", "6304117752", "6302787068", "6302968143", "079070546X", "B000A468XY", "B00003CX8I", "6302526574", "6302320402", "0788805533", "B00003CXI0", "6305940932", "B0000A02WC", "0788805843", "6303148352", "6304500831", "B00005JKDQ", "6305750750", "6304401132", "6304400551", "6302921228", "B00005JL95", "0307142450", "6303315305", "6303442447", "6304501153", "B000009CTR", "0800125789", "0783216084", "6303212395", "0784011923", "6304089767", "6302481805", "B0000AK7AB", "0790700506", "6304873441", "6304143184", "630339406X", "B0000AQZYM", "6305326940", "B000035Z2S", "B0000524CZ", "0788802194", "B00005LOUS", "B00005B238", "6303036813", "6304434340"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 209060}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.87, "brand": "FOX Video", "asin": "6302091632", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GTF7T3ZPL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Home Alone [VHS]"}

{"description": "When two Italian-American boys from New York are falsely accused of murder in a small Alabama town, they call for a lawyer--but the only lawyer they know is their cousin Vinny (Joe Pesci), who made six attempts before he passed his bar exam.My Cousin Vinnyis a classic fish-out-of-water comedy; the flimsy plot about clearing the two boys and solving the murder is just a hook to support a lot of culture-clash humor. Thanks to the strong cast of character actors like Fred Gwynne, Austin Pendleton, and Lane Smith, it's pretty funny--even old-hat jokes about Brooklyn versus Southern accents come to life. Pesci has played a few too many schticky characters, but this time it works. There's just enough humanity in his caricature to make Vinny likable and entertaining. When the movie was released, there was controversy about whether Marisa Tomei, playing Vinny's big-haired and black-leather-wearing fianc&eacute;e, deserved to win the best supporting actress Oscar (she beat out Judy Davis, Joan Plowright, Miranda Richardson, and Vanessa Redgrave); but seeing her performance on its own, it's a comic marvel and worthy of honor.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303101267", "6300989003", "6301569385", "630281622X", "6300247112", "6305576173", "6304994540", "6300213986", "B00000JGEK", "6301666569", "6302054982"], "also_viewed": ["6301398912", "630339406X", "0792116887", "6304233639"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 107990}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6302516986", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51P02PZFZRL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "My Cousin Vinny [VHS]"}
{"description": "City Lightsis a film to pick for the time capsule, a film that best represents the many aspects of director-writer-star Charlie Chaplin at the peak of his powers: Chaplin the actor, the sentimentalist, the knockabout clown, the ballet dancer, the athlete, the lover, the tragedian, the fool. It's all contained in Chaplin's simple story of a tramp who falls in love with a blind flower girl (Virginia Cherrill). Chaplin elevates the Victorian contrivances of the plot to something glorious with his inventive use of pantomime and his sure grasp of how the Tramp relates to the audience. In 1931, it was a gamble for Chaplin to stick with silence after talking pictures had killed off the art form that had made him famous, but audiences flocked toCity Lightsanyway. (Chaplin would not make his first full talking picture until 1940'sThe Great Dictator.) After all the superb comic sequences, the film culminates with one of the most moving scenes in the history of cinema, a luminous and heartbreaking fade-out that lifts the picture onto another plane. (Woody Allen paid homage to the scene at the end ofManhattan.)

{"description": "This black-and-white film adaptation of Tennessee Williams's Southern gothic play is perhaps more famous for the rumored off-screen shenanigans of its stars than for its over-the-top repressed sexuality (only Williams could pull off that paradox, and pull it off he does). Supposedly, stars Katharine Hepburn and Elizabeth Taylor battled for screen time; Hepburn warred very publicly with director Joseph Mankiewicz; and a postaccident Montgomery Clift relied heavily on painkillers and support from friend Taylor during the grueling shoot. Even this, however, cannot top the events of the film itself, revolving around the unseen playboy Sebastian and his mysterious death, which has something to do with young boys, a decadent European vacation, and Taylor in a provocative wet, white bathing suit. To give away the plot would spoil the fun, but suffice it to say that what Taylor saw was so horrible it drove her nuts, and Sebastian's mother (Hepburn) wants her to have a lobotomy in order to keep it from coming out; Clift is brought in to do the procedure. It's all a hoot and a holler, but as played by the two leading ladies (both of whom nabbed Oscar nominations), it's also compelling, chilling, and utterly gothic. Taylor gives a fierce performance, as the climaxing monologue that reveals Sebastian's \"secret\" rests entirely on her shoulders, and Hepburn plays brilliantly against type as Sebastian's manipulating, overbearing mother. Only Clift, saddled with a dreary character in charge of plot exposition, fails to deliver.

{"description": "EDITOR'S NOTE: According to a Warner Home Video technician involved in  the production ofThe Stanley Kubrick Collection, Kubrick authorized all aspects of theCollection, from the use of Digital Component Video (or \"D-1\") masters originally approved in 1989, to the use of minimalist screen menus, chapter stops, and (in the case of2001: A Space OdysseyandThe Shiningon DVD) supplementary materials. Full-screen presentation ofThe ShiningandFull Metal Jacketwas also approved by Kubrick, who recomposed his original framing,  reportedly believing that those films looked best on video in the full-screen format. (In fact, the original theatrical aspect ratio ofThe Shiningwas 1.66:1, meaning that a relatively small portion of the image is lost.) Kubrick also chose mono over stereo,  believing that inconsistencies in theatrical sound systems resulted in loss of control over theatrical presentation. In every respect, the Warner spokesman  said, the films in theCollectionremain as Kubrick approved them. Any future attempt to remaster or alter them would  have to be approved by an appointee of the Kubrick estate.", "related": {"also_bought": ["0790705141", "0792839846", "6303402070", "0783221347", "0790731975", "0784011923", "6300182916", "6300216047", "0792842464", "6302360978", "6300185281", "6302054982", "6302120101", "B00005ATQA", "6305237115", "0790734079", "B001BZQMFA", "6300184110", "6300183416", "B00000J2L7", "B00000FZCU", "6300216500", "B000AMW2TK", "6301564456", "6300247171", "B00000JGEK", "630442972X", "B00005B238", "0790758474", "0790733927", "6303953425", "0783217528", "0792845684", "B00004W5UA", "0767825411", "6304429274", "6300183092", "6305363668", "0790734877", "B00000JRUB", "0783235607"], "bought_together": ["0790705141"], "also_viewed": ["B001993Y1S", "B008M4MB8K", "B00337QJO8", "B00GGAK0FS", "B00108E1GU", "B006JVPK2M", "6302610702", "B008MILL8C", "6300214826", "B001AQO3QA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 369746}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6302760046", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514N60SRJ4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]"}
{"description": "A titanic performance by Jack Nicholson powers this fact-and-fiction biography of Teamsters president Jimmy Hoffa. From the opening moment--Hoffa sitting alone in the back of a car--Nicholson's performance is one of his best, and a rare role as a historical person. The sweeping all-American story of a common worker who reaches the highest pinnacle in the world's most powerful union is sweepingly told with wondrous detail, in wardrobe, sets, and trucks. The better-documented facts of Hoffa's life, including his struggle against Attorney General Bobby Kennedy (Kevin Anderson), supply the backbone of the story. But the hope of what the Teamsters are to the American Dream is what makes the film glow (swept along by David Newman's score). The screenplay by David Mamet takes two wild and entertaining divergences from fact. The first is the character of Hoffa's ubiquitous sidekick Bobby Ciaro, played by the film's director, Danny DeVito. It's a fictitious role, a composite character that allows the story to be clearly told, as does the second--Mamet's explanation of Hoffa's  famous disappearance.--Doug Thomas", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 437008}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6302731224", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5106DWT909L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Hoffa [VHS]"}

{"description": "Rock historians and hard-core Buddy Holly fans can and do take issue with director Steve Rash's 1978 biopic of the Lubbock, Texas, rocker's life: the script liberally juggles details from Holly's brief but blazing career, replacing producer Norman Petty and Holly's original bassist and drummer with fictionalized composite characters. Yet the core of the film, and the reason it's definitely worth a look and listen, is Gary Busey's lusty performance in the title role, triumphing against what might have seemed miscasting.The burly, lantern-jawed Busey steps into the lankier, narrow-faced Holly's blue suede shoes and dances off with the movie. At a time when live rock albums thought little of overdubbing mistakes in the studio, director Rash honored Busey's nervy gamble in performing these songs live, singing in his own raw voice and rumbling through his own approximations of Holly's guitar work. What's lost in precise verisimilitude is more than compensated by Busey's conviction and a palpable, almost ecstatic terror as he charges through Holly's wonderful songs before indifferent roller-rink audiences.Other films have nailed the period more accurately through art direction or script, but Busey's authentic energy gives this movie an emotional veracity that's just right for this chapter in rock history. Still, for musical purposes, go straight to the source, Holly's wonderful recordings.--Sam Sutherland", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000003U12", "0767825985", "1558035745", "6300182304", "6301978587", "0783222955", "B000006FNX", "6301797906", "B00004CNR5", "6303215734"], "bought_together": ["B000003U12", "1558035745"], "also_viewed": ["B0002VGTBQ", "B000A50460"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 304717}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.99, "brand": "", "asin": "630280096X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51WZ02HTT6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Buddy Holly Story [VHS] (1978)"}

Loosely based on the true crimes of Ed Gein (also a partial inspiration forPsycho), the original Jeffrey Dahmer,Texas Chainsaw Massacrefollows a group of teenagers who pick up a hitchhiker and wind up in a backwoods horror chamber where they're held captive, tortured, chopped up, and impaled on meat hooks by a demented cannibalistic family, including a character known as Leatherface who maniacally wields one helluva chainsaw. The movie's powerful sense of dread is heightened by its grainy, semi-documentary style--but it also has a wicked sense of humor (and not that camp, self-referential variety that became so tiresome in subsequent horror films of the '70s, '80s, and '90s).

{"description": "Between 1961 and 1963, Ingmar Bergman released a remarkable trilogy of so-called chamber dramas, each one concerned with the futility of sustaining faith in God, family, love, or much else.

Neither man can help or heal the other, or even inspire renewed confidence in practiced rituals and older, more certain views of the world. Set on a chilly, Sunday afternoon,Winter Light's heavy stillness, lack of music, preference for intense close-ups and distancing long shots, and barren setting all lead us inescapably into the core of a profound silence, an echo chamber in which love can't grow and religion rings hollow.

{"description": "Although Hollywood's golden year of 1939 is best remembered forGone with the WindandThe Wizard of Oz, it was also a banner year for sophisticated screen comedy, and Mitchell Leisen'sMidnightis a deliciously prime example. Screenwriters Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett were in peak form when they concocted this smooth confection about Eve Peabody (Claudette Colbert), an American showgirl in Paris who is out of work, money, and luck when a handsome cabbie (Don Ameche) offers to drive her around the City of Light to search for employment as a nightclub chanteuse. Nobody's hiring, but Eve has a better plan: posing as a Hungarian countess, she smuggles her way into Parisian high society and suddenly finds herself in the lap of luxury, commissioned by a wealthy aristocrat (John Barrymore) to seduce a French playboy (Francis Lederer) away from Barrymore's not-so-loyal wife (Mary Astor). While Eve is living it up at the Ritz Hotel and enjoying trips to Versailles, Ameche's on a mission to find her and declare his true love.Class distinction, infidelity, false identity... these were daring ingredients for a 1939 comedy, andMidnight(a casebook display of Paramount's shimmering studio style of the '30s) is as fresh today as it was when first released. The silky perfection of the Wilder-Brackett screenplay is expertly served by Leisen (a director who deserves ranking with Ernst Lubitsch and Preston Sturges), and Colbert is merely the brightest star in a flawless cast of screwball veterans. Poking fun at the elite was a Wilder-Brackett specialty, and Barrymore is particularly savvy to the material, giving a performance that's simultaneously sly, desperate, and hilariously inspired.

{"description": "Edward D. Wood Jr. was an actor writer-director-producer, occasionally in drag, who combined meager bursts of talent with an undying optimism to create some of the most bizarrely memorable \"B\" movies to ever come out of Tinseltown. Though Wood died in obscurity as an alcoholic in 1978, his films have been considered cult classics for years. He is consistently voted the worst director who ever lived. You would think this an odd subject, but director Tim Burton harnesses the undying hopefulness that made Wood such a character. Shot in black and white, just like Wood's creations, this stylized, witty production captures the poetic absurdity of Wood's films and his unconventional life. Burton's recreation of Wood's wonderfully awfulPlan 9 from Outer Spacelooks much better than the original low-budget quickie. Burton tackled an extremely strange subject matter for a biopic, but Wood is presented as naive almost to the point of delusion, so the story works. The pace sags in the middle, as the weirdness starts to wear thin, but Depp proves himself an adroit actor, even while wearing angora and a blonde wig. Wood's unconventional repertoire company is faithfully reproduced, including an Academy Award-winning Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi. Landau is pathetic, droll, and charismatic as the elderly junkie who made his last screen appearances in Wood's films.--Rochelle O'Gorman", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301763041", "0800187873"], "bought_together": ["6301763041"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 314635}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.87, "brand": "", "asin": "6303407188", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51F97RJE9XL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Ed Wood [VHS]"}

YetGlen or Glenda?goes way beyond camp, into some unique zone of demented personal expression, an essay/collage/autobiography that is no less fascinating just because it comes from a second-rate mind. Wood himself, under the pseudonym Daniel Davis, plays a transvestite struggling to reveal his tendencies to his wife (the toneless Dolores Fuller, Wood's missus in real life). Mixed in with this exploitation story is a ton of irrelevant stock footage, as well as disconnected glimpses of B&eacute;la Lugosi bellowing at the audience; Lugosi's dialogue is a tapestry of non sequiturs and portentous warnings. The behind-the-scenes creation ofGlen or Glenda?forms part of the action ofEd Wood, Tim Burton's affectionate tribute to the B-movie master. Wood himself was a transvestite, which accounts for the cracked sincerity ofGlen or Glenda?; the passion for angora sweaters is real, not a fluffy plot device.

Newman gives a brilliant performance (Oscar-nominated and winner of two critics circle awards) relying on his well-honed subtleties. The dramatics are simple: the return of his son (Dylan Walsh) and grandson, offering a chance to reconcile; odd jobs for a construction company he's trying to sue for an injury; and a comedic grudge match against the owner (a reserved Bruce Willis). North Bath is the kind of place, wrapped in winter (beautifully shot by John Bailey), where enemies are friends, marriages are shaky, and Hawaii is only a state of mind.

{"description": "Jessica Lange is a social worker who falls for an abandoned newborn and breaks all the rules by bringing him home. Halle Berry is the homeless druggie who dumped the baby. One of the film's best attributes is that it reveals everyone's perspective, though much of the story is told from Berry's point of view. Strung out on crack, Berry's character thinks nothing of hiding her baby in a cardboard box near a dumpster before going off for a fix. We watch Berry painfully pull herself up out of the gutter and make a life for herself. She embraces decency and sobriety and becomes the person she might have always been had her childhood been different. After Lange and her amiable spouse (David Strathairn) have formed strong family ties with this difficult child, they find themselves fighting to keep him when Berry decides she wants Isaiah back. Naomi Foner's clever script reveals a legal system that is as much a character in this painful story as the attorney (Samuel L. Jackson) who takes on the case pro bono. Though the film ultimately flounders under a hesitant ending, Lange is such a dynamo that this tragic story still comes recommended.--Rochelle O'Gorman", "related": {"also_bought": ["6304773285", "6300270971", "6302779278"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 333536}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.75, "brand": "", "asin": "6303574203", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41T2MBSNADL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Losing Isaiah [VHS]"}

{"description": "David Mamet's 1987 directorial debut was this mesmerizing study of  control and seduction between two kinds of detached observers: a gambler who is also a con artist, and a psychotherapist who is also an emerging pop-psych guru in the book market. The latter (played by Lindsay Crouse) meets the former (Joe Mantegna) when one of her clients is driven to despair from his debts to the card shark. Mantegna's character agrees to drop the IOUs in exchange for Crouse's attention at the seedy House of Games in Seattle, a mecca for con men to talk shop and hustle unsuspecting customers. The shrink gets so caught up in the arcane rules and world view of her guide over subsequent days that she observes--with no false rapture--various stings in progress inside and outside the club. Mamet's story finally becomes a fascinating study of two people protecting and extending their respective cosmologies the way rival predators fight for the same piece of turf.

{"description": "Hollywood's legendary \"woman's director,\" George Cukor (The Women,The Philadelphia Story), transformed Audrey Hepburn into street-urchin-turned-proper-lady Eliza Doolittle in this film version of the Lerner and Loewe musical. Based on George Bernard Shaw's playPygmalion,My Fair Ladystars Rex Harrison as linguist Henry Higgins (Harrison also played the role, opposite Julie Andrews, on stage), who draws Eliza into a social experiment that works almost too well. The letterbox edition of this film on video certainly pays tribute to the pageantry of Cukor's set, but it also underscores a certain visual stiffness that can slow viewer enthusiasm just a tad. But it's really star wattage that keeps this film exciting, that and such great songs as \"On the Street Where You Live\" and \"I Could Have Danced All Night.\" Actor Jeremy Brett, who gained a huge following later in life portraying Sherlock Holmes, is quite electric as Eliza's determined suitor.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["6304117752", "630233683X", "B00000F6D1", "6305282927", "6303494390", "6305123616", "6304151306", "6303444202", "630197736X", "6300246787", "6300215814", "630150528X", "B00000JS61", "6304400551", "B00004TRD5", "0790744759", "0792837533", "B00000I1EM", "0792839846", "6304331851", "6303854311", "B0000048YM", "6302363268", "6303215734", "0792840836", "0792151712", "6300207919", "B00AMEZDK6", "6300215695", "B00005JL1P", "6301586026", "6305750750", "6301390725", "6303314015", "0792837614", "6300215717", "0788806270", "B000URDCC6", "6302820448", "B0045HCJJY", "0788802194", "B00005LL26", "6304504012", "0783222955", "6302526574", "B00004WZQ2", "B0000633ZP", "6302799139", "B00004TZS4", "6300181529", "6300270351", "B000GFK81K", "B00AEFY5TI", "B0002YLCG0", "B0000VCZKM", "6300251152", "0792837630", "6300215598", "6300181456", "6303631851", "B00000491O", "6301797957", "B00005JLIU", "6304044836", "B004A7XXJO", "0790741091", "6301969251", "630344394X", "0783241569", "B002M2Z3BA", "B00004RV8M", "6302878527", "6300216233", "0790751216", "6303562248", "078061755X", "630197154X", "B00005A1VG", "6302208920", "0792840844", "6300215776", "0790758474", "6302797667", "B0001E7LQG", "6303965415", "6303675212", "B00003CXFU", "6302610699", "6302299497", "6302800854", "0788811355", "6300247139"], "bought_together": ["6304117752"], "also_viewed": ["B005NFJAZS", "6304117752", "B00BTYU3ZS", "630233683X", "6305282927", "6305123616", "B000HT3PGU", "B000MV9O4U", "B0045HCJJY", "B0090XLDKY", "6303494390", "B000087EYD", "B00000F6D1", "6300274268", "B00AATV0WS", "B0006V6TO4", "6300215717", "0788802194", "6304151306", "B00005JL1P", "6304539274", "0792839129", "B001XVZURI", "6300213803", "B000035Z2S", "B00000JS61", "155890641X", "6300263673", "5559477621", "6304331851", "0792839846", "B001PO54V0", "B003VS0CX8", "6301792769", "B0000AM6IY", "6305320802", "0792151712", "B000HT3PGK", "B0045HCJQM", "6304400225", "6300181529", "B006TTC5WC", "0788805843", "B00AEFXMGU", "6303824358", "6304539258", "B00005LL26", "B007P7UF0G", "6300215695", "630197736X", "076781326X", "6303109918", "6302484359", "0792837630", "6302363268", "6304022492", "B001E4TDR2", "B00004R99N", "080013558X"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 50217}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6304178352", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51SX55C3JDL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "My Fair Lady (digitally THX mastered) [VHS]"}

{"description": "George Romero's 1978 follow-up to his classicNight of the Living Deadis quite terrifying and gory (those zombies do like the taste of living flesh). But in its own way, it is just as comically satiric as the first film in its take on contemporary values. This time, we follow the fortunes of four people who lock themselves inside a shopping mall to get away from the marauding dead and who then immerse themselves in unabashed consumerism, taking what they want from an array of clothing and jewelry shops, making gourmet meals, etc. It is Romero's take on Louis XVI in the modern world: keep the starving masses at bay and crank up the insulated indulgence. Still, this is a horror film when all is said and done, and even some of Romero's best visual jokes (a Hare Krishna turned blue-skinned zombie) can make you sweat.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["6304983794", "6305095566", "B00000JXVM", "B000068IEV", "6302517036", "6302921058", "6301969782", "0792839234", "B004HHX9OQ", "B0087ZG7UW", "6304819927", "B00023NRSM", "0792845684", "1564427803", "6300182878", "6300262855", "0783235607", "B00008EYBD", "B0000066X4", "630428845X", "6302968100", "6302088607", "0780627032", "6302036852"], "also_viewed": ["B002KAIW4E", "B00D7AM71A", "6304983794", "B001CW7ZW6", "B00000G1XV", "B00000JXVM", "B00000K3TO", "B00023NRSM", "B000FS9FE4", "6304819927", "B0025VLEMK", "B001CDLARQ", "630428845X", "B000AQ69UO", "B000RJO56O", "B000RIWAVW", "B005CM1IES", "6301969782", "B001CW7ZWG", "0780627032", "6303257879", "B00KTFJ50M", "6301961404", "B001YZU32A", "B0089N4G50", "B0009A40ES", "B00JHH1W9K", "B005J9ZE5I", "6300158411", "6304288433", "B0002ABUT8", "B00DEQQK8S", "0792836634", "630130053X", "6303265693", "6300214087", "6300189015", "B00005K3O4", "B002VWNIDG", "6302120101", "B001CW7ZVC", "B00AZ7V0W0", "B0040YFR1Y", "B000009NQY", "6302921058", "6305095566", "B000LPS4BG", "B00IF8Q0YE", "6300214192", "B00E5S2HGS", "B00KDU8HQQ"]}, "price": 34.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 326849}, "asin": "6304240554", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518MTSB8ACL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Dawn of the Dead [VHS]"}
{"description": "This complex and rich film by John Sayles stars Chris Cooper as the contemporary sheriff of a Texas border town still under the sway of his late, legendary lawman father (Matthew McConaughey, seen in flashbacks). The discovery of a skeleton and crusted-over badge--buried some 40 years--initiates an investigation into an old crime no one wants to talk about but which will determine for Cooper's character, once and for all, various truths about his father's life. Sayles ingeniously sets this mystery against the backdrop of a developing, multicultural community losing its economic base while haggling over a history of racism. The overall effect is of a complicated American tragedy mitigated by the possibility of personal redemption. A terrific experience.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301963717", "B00005U16N", "6303696678", "0783215517", "6300270025", "B00007CVYA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 430016}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.49, "brand": "", "asin": "630422513X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/7146M1FJXWL._SY300_.gif", "title": "Lone Star [VHS]"}
{"description": "Chungking Expresstells two stories loosely connected by a Hong Kong snack bar. In one story, a cop who's been recently dumped by his girlfriend becomes obsessed with the expiration dates on cans of pineapple; he's constantly distracted as he tries to track down a drug dealer in a blond wig (played by Brigitte Lin, best known fromSwordsman IIandThe Bride with White Hair). Meanwhile, another cop who's recently been dumped by his girlfriend (Tony Leung Chiu-Wai, from John Woo'sHard-BoiledandA Bullet in the Head) mopes around his apartment, talking to his sponge and other domestic objects. He catches the eye of a shop girl (Hong Kong pop star Faye Wang) who secretly breaks in and cleans his apartment. If you're beginning to suspect that neither of these stories has a conventional plot, you're correct. WhatChungking Expressdoes have is loads of energy and a gorgeous visual style that never gets in the way of engaging with the charming characters. The movie was shot on the fly by hip director Wong Kar-Wai (Happy Together,Ashes of Time), using only available lighting and found locations. The movie's loose, improvisational feel is closer to Jean-Luc Godard'sBreathlessthan any recent film--and that's high praise. Quirky, funny, and extremely engaging,Chungking Expressmanages to be experimental and completely accessible at the same time.--Bret Fetzer", "price": 7.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 417933}, "asin": "6304267835", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Y5M1X63JL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Chungking Express [VHS]"}
{"description": "Vincent Price gives an atypically restrained performance as the sole survivor of a worldwide plague that revives its victims as bloodthirsty vampires. During the day, he canvasses his abandoned hometown, tracking down and stalking his former friends and neighbors, always making sure to return before nightfall, when the dead rise to assault his fortified house. Hope arrives in the form of an apparently normal young woman (Franca Bettoia), but her agenda proves to be even more sinister than that of the vampires.Based on the 1954 novel by coscripter Matheson (whose displeasure with the final product spurred the use of a pseudonym), this Italian-made production is best known for its influence on George Romero'sNight of the Living Dead. The similarities between the two films go beyond the presence of shuffling zombies and housebound heroes; both feature taboo-breaking scenes of interfamilial murder, and both end on bleak, dystopian notes. WhileThe Last Man on Earthlacks the political and darkly satirical shadings (and graphic gore) that makeNight of the Living Deada more memorable experience, the combination of Bava-esque Gothic atmosphere and bleak, documentary-style camerawork by directors Ragona and Salkow (the brother of Price's agent Lester Salkow) lend themselves to moments of pure frisson that compare laudably to Romero's film.  Matheson's novel also provided the source material for the awkward 1971 Charlton Heston vehicleThe Omega Man. A planned third version, helmed by Ridley Scott and starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, was shut down in its earliest stages due to skyrocketing budget costs.--Paul Gaita", "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 751347}, "asin": "6304277385", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/7114X6M9A7L._SY300_.gif", "title": "Last Man on Earth [VHS]"}
{"description": "John Travolta's should've-been-nominated-for-an-Oscar performance is the best reason to see this largely moving work, which is a little reminiscent of the novelFlowers for Algernon(basis for the filmCharly). Travolta plays a mechanic who sees a bright light in the sky one night and wakes up the next morning a genius, hungry for knowledge and so smart he figures out national defense secrets in his own living room (and gets in hot water for it). The more interesting drama, however, is not with the government but with the character's longtime neighbors and friends, who come to reject him for being different. Robert Duvall gives a stirring performance as a doctor who has known the hero all his life, and Kyra Sedgwick is very good as an ambivalent love interest. If you missed this one in the theaters, then you haven't seen one of Travolta's best performances since his comeback.

{"description": "Jackis Francis Coppola at his most pointless noodling, looking for the film he wants to make instead of just making it. Robin Williams stars as 10-year-old Jack, a boy with an inexplicable disease that ages him at four times the normal human rate. Kept at home like a contemporary Boo Radley, Jack becomes a neighborhood legend until his parents relent and send him to school. In time, the other kids befriend him and stay loyal as his hyperdevelopment puts a strain on his body and emotions. The idea is sound, but the execution is a bore. The best the script and Coppola can come up with are painfully long scenes in which Williams's character proves himself on the playground and in gross-out contests in a tree house. Coppola fishes around for signs of life and spontaneity in these scenes, but the film is actually best when Jack has to cope with certain feelings in his mature body (such as his attraction to a character played by Fran Drescher) that he isn't prepared for emotionally.Jackwould have been a lot better if Coppola had embraced a plan from beginning to end and stuck to it.--Tom Keogh", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 192564}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.97, "brand": "", "asin": "6304298285", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514MW3QXTBL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Jack [VHS]"}

His films share a real immediacy with Allen's work: they feel as if they are happening now. Leigh works with actors--real actors--on ideas and language. There is no script at the start (and sometimes not at the end).Secrets and Liesinvolves Hortense (Marianne Jean-Baptiste), an elegant black woman wanting to learn her birth mother's identity. She will find it's Cynthia (Brenda Blethyn), who is one of the saddest creatures we've seen in film. She's also one of the most real and, ultimately, one of the most lovable. Timothy Spall is Cynthia's brother, a giant man full of love who is being slowly defeated by his fastidious wife (Phyllis Logan).There is a great exuberance of life inSecrets & Lies, winner of the Palme D'Or and best actress (Blethyn) at the 1996 Cannes Film Festival--notZorba-type life but the little battles fought and won every day. Leigh's honest interpretation of daily life is usually found only on the stage.Secrets & Liesis more realistic than a stage production, however, especially when Leigh shows us uninterrupted scenes. Critic David Denby states that Leigh has \"made an Ingmar Bergman film without an instant of heaviness or pretension.\" If that sounds like your cup of tea, seeSecrets & Lies.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00003CXMY", "B0000DI87S", "B0058EA3MS", "B00000JL7T", "B0007ZEOPK", "B0008ENIAC", "B00007KK3X", "6304442459", "6302451930", "6300268063", "6302226899"], "bought_together": ["B00003CXMY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 233435}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 15.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6304393121", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41VJYDY11EL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Secrets &amp; Lies [VHS]"}

{"description": "Dashing Errol Flynn is the definitive Robin Hood in the most gloriously swashbuckling version of the legendary story. Warner Brothers reunited Michael Curtiz, their top-action director, with the winning team of Flynn and Olivia de Havilland (Maid Marian) and perennial villain Basil Rathbone as the aristocratic Sir Guy of Gisbourne, and pulled out all stops for the production. It became their costliest film to date, a grandly handsome, glowing Technicolor adventure set to a stirring,Oscar-winning scoreby Erich Wolfgang Korngold. The decadent Prince John (a smoothly conniving Claude Rains) takes advantage of King Richard's absence to tax the country into poverty but meets his match in the medieval guerrilla rebel Robin Hood and his Merry Men of Sherwood Forest, who rise up and, to quote a clich&eacute; coined by the film, \"steal from the rich and give to the poor.\" Stocky Alan Hale Sr. plays Robin's loyal friend Little John (a part he played in Douglas Fairbanks's silent version), Eugene Palette the portly Friar Tuck, and Melville Cooper the bumbling Sheriff of Nottingham. Flynn's confidence and cocky charm makes for a perfect Robin Hood, and his easygoing manner is a marvelous counterpoint to Rathbone's regal bearing and courtly diction. The film climaxes in their rousing battle-to-the-finish sword fight, a magnificently choreographed scene highlighted by Curtiz's inventive use of shadows cast upon the castle walls.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302120527", "6301976932", "6301977181", "6301977149", "6303212263", "6305123616", "B00004RFHL", "6301574117", "0790743159", "6300214060", "B00005A1VH", "6304178352", "0792839846", "630233683X", "6301977173", "6302961688", "630150528X", "6304935811", "B00005RRG6", "B00000JKNP", "6301973305", "6301670140", "1558800034", "0792107683", "B00004RGUU", "0782008348"], "bought_together": ["6301977149"], "also_viewed": ["B00005PJ8I"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 538065}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6304546386", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RMAFMQ02L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Adventures of Robin Hood [VHS]"}

{"description": "In biographies written before 1990, Jennifer Jason Leigh claims to have been born in 1958. Recently, she's changed that to 1962. In either case, she definitely looks a bit odd in this 1998 release playing a 20-year-old opposite the youthful Ben Chaplin. Even stranger is the fact that she's been cast as the ugly girl; after all, she was voted one of America's 10 most beautiful women byHarper's Bazaar. Still, this film captures to a T the Henry James novel on which it is based. The story concerns Catherine Sloper, a 19th-century heiress whose father disapproves of the man she loves. In a twisty plot, questions are raised about both her father's and her suitor's motives, and Catherine must untangle the connections between love and money. This provides fodder for Henry James's critiques of the shallowness and sexism of his society. Some find James's work stiff, self-important, and a bit dull, while others see him as the most astute social critic of his time, so your enjoyment of this film may be a matter of taste.

{"description": "After the tight plotting and quirky intensity ofFargo, this casually amusing follow-up from the prolifically inventive Coen (Ethan and Joel) brothers seems like a bit of a lark, and the result was a box-office disappointment. The good news is,The Big Lebowskiis every bit a Coen movie, and its lazy plot is part of its laidback charm. After all, how many movies can claim as their hero a pot-bellied, pot-smoking loser named Jeff \"The Dude\" Lebowski (Jeff Bridges) who spends most of his time bowling and getting stoned? And where else could you find a hairnetted Latino bowler named Jesus (John Turturro) who sports dazzling purple footgear, or an erotic artist (Julianne Moore) whose creativity consists of covering her naked body in paint, flying through the air in a leather harness, and splatting herself against a giant canvas? Who else but the Coens would think of showing you a camera view from inside the holes of a bowling ball, or an elaborate Busby Berkely-styled musical dream sequence involving a Viking goddess and giant bowling pins? The plot--which finds Lebowski involved in a kidnapping scheme after he's mistaken for a rich guy with the same name--is almost beside the point. What counts here is a steady cascade of hilarious dialogue, great work from Coen regulars John Goodman and Steve Buscemi, and the kind of cinematic ingenuity that puts the Coens in a class all their own. Be sure to watch with snacks in hand, becauseThe Big Lebowskimight give you a giddy case of the munchies.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783228317", "0792845684", "B000056V73", "B000059HCI", "B0002G2B2W", "6305123616", "0792839846", "6304078145", "6302610702", "6304340648", "6301666569", "6302516986", "0790705141", "6303953425", "6300214753", "6305499365", "B00005ATQA", "630268644X", "6301578805", "6301627768", "6300184064", "0790734079", "6303454089", "6302941318", "6302054982", "1558807381"], "also_viewed": ["B0002G2B2W", "0783228317", "6304297912"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 212775}, "asin": "6304994540", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51WB1EBQW6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Big Lebowski [VHS]"}
{"description": "The curiosity of Quentin Tarantino'sJackie Brownis Robert Forster's worldly wise bail bondsman Max Cherry, the most alive character in this adaptation of Elmore Leonard'sRum Punch. The Academy Awards saw it the same way, giving Forster the film's only nomination. The film is more \"rum\" than \"punch\" and will certainly disappoint those who are looking for Tarantino's trademark style. This movie is a slow, decaffeinated story of six characters glued to a half million dollars brought illegally into the country. The money belongs to Ordell (Samuel&nbsp;L. Jackson), a gunrunner just bright enough to control his universe and do his own dirty work. His just-paroled friend--a loose term with Ordell--Louis (Robert De Niro) is just taking up space and could be interested in the money. However, his loyalties are in question between his old partner and Ordell's doped-up girl (Bridget Fonda). Certainly Fed Ray Nicolette (Michael Keaton) wants to arrest Ordell with the illegal money. The key is the title character, a late-40s-ish flight attendant (Pam Grier) who can pull her own weight and soon has both sides believing she's working for them. The end result is rarely in doubt, and what is left is two hours of Tarantino's expert dialogue as he moves his characters around town.Tarantino changed the race of Jackie and Ordell, a move that means little except that it allows Tarantino to heap on black culture and language, something he has a gift and passion for. He said this film is for an older audience although the language and drug use may put them off. The film is not a salute to Grier's blaxploitation films beyond the musical score. Unexpectedly the most fascinating scenes are between Grier and Forster: two neo-stars glowing in the limelight of their first major Hollywood film after decades of work.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000X81ZI", "6303953425", "B00006G8O1", "B000286RJI", "6304106017", "B000067DGJ", "6305095566", "B0000633ZP", "6302968100", "6302816580", "B000056V73", "630504077X", "630300394X"], "bought_together": ["B0000X81ZI"], "also_viewed": ["B009B0OG1O", "630268644X", "6300183211"]}, "price": 9.85, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 236793}, "asin": "6305006598", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71GXP626B7L._SY300_.gif", "title": "Jackie Brown [VHS]"}
{"description": "This popular and beloved film, produced by Tsui Hark and  directed by Ching Siu Tung, is a standout in the Hong Kong supernatural-action genre and spawned many sequels and copycats.A Chinese Ghost Storystars Leslie Cheung as Ning Tsei-Shen, a timid and likable tax collector. Looking for a place to stay the night, he comes upon a spooky abandoned temple occupied by a tough Taoist swordsman (Ma Wu).  Despite his  warnings, Tsei-Shen stays anyway.  Later he encounters a beautiful maiden (Joey  Wang) who he quickly falls in love with.  Unfortunately, she is a ghost who  is being forced to trap men for an evil spirit who feeds on their souls.A Chinese Ghost Storyhas been widely praised for infusing the genre  with humor, action, romance, and inventive special effects. Memorable images include an attacking mile-long tongue and a cloak opening to dozens of ghastly decapitated heads. The final battle in hell is said to have inspired scenes in Sam Raimi'sArmy of Darkness.  And the film  has its share of homage: A group of crusty zombies are reminiscent of the skeletons in special-effects guru Ray Harryhausen's7th Voyage of Sinbad--and they are eliminated by Tsei-Shen in comedic slapstick fashion, not unlike the style of Charlie Chaplin. Cheung and Wang are a likeable romantic pair, and Ma Wu creates a hilarious character who  breaks out into song and a martial arts dance when drunk. The DVD transfer is  topnotch, with the film's misty mood lighting and fluttering gowns appearing layered and crisp. It's a must-see for Hong Kong action film fans.--Shannon Gee", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305020884", "6305020892", "B008WAM36O", "B000MM0LEG", "B00284G2BC", "B0034KYF7W", "B000059XU4", "B00004YKSJ", "630502054X", "0851705146", "B0002CR08Q", "B001CD6GL6", "B000NVT0SY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0076W0Q7M", "6305020884", "B004M3HZWM", "B0050G381W"]}, "price": 28.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 324749}, "asin": "6305020876", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51FKFQZ7WEL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "A Chinese Ghost Story"}
{"description": "Some critics and filmgoers have hailed this 1989 comedy-drama as Woody Allen's best film, and while that's certainly open for debate, a good case can be made that it's the most ambitious and morally complex of Allen's films. It's the kind of movie that provokes heated philosophical debate about the role of God in our lives, the nature of guilt, and the circumstances that would allow a seemingly good, law-abiding family man and successful professional (Martin Landau) to commit a murder with no risk of being caught. Could you live with yourself under those conditions? Allen explores this complicated issue in the context of an extramarital affair that Landau's mistress (Anjelica Huston) threatens to expose, while developing a second story about a documentary filmmaker (Allen) who reluctantly makes a film about his brother-in-law (Alan Alda), a TV sitcom producer whose vanity is seemingly unlimited. From serious crimes to misdemeanors of personal behavior, Allen ties these stories together to create a provocative and unsettling study of divergent moralities and the price we're willing to pay to preserve our personal comfort and happiness. It's a sobering film, but a fascinating and funny one as well, unfolding like a thriller in which the question is not whodunit but rather, would you do it if you knew you could get away with it?--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005O06J", "0767819764", "B000062XE6", "0792846109", "6304907729", "B00005O06N", "B000EQHXNW", "6305327068", "0792846125", "B00005O06M", "0792846087", "0792846117", "B00AEFYVUQ", "B003UESJCY", "B00005O06I", "6305291470", "B00005O06L", "B000IU37SO", "B00008978N", "B00005AUJH", "B00005AUJO", "6305428085", "B00003CXGS", "B005MYEQ4U", "B00A1O0G3G", "B00008L3SA", "B001DJ7PR8", "0792846060", "B00005AUJI", "B009UTX4M8", "B000AM6P2U", "0780622243", "1879505274", "B002LMV7RA", "B00004STRD", "B00013D580", "B0013D8LC2", "B00005O06K", "B00020X88E", "0792846095", "B006FSRSTC", "B00003CY6A", "0801031877", "B00005U8EN", "B00005JMON", "B00005O06O", "B00G7QPXUI", "B007NYZA0Q", "B00005AUJM", "B00JLDTBCU", "B000CNESU8", "B00005JL81", "B006FSRSFQ", "B00004WI55", "B00000JGOI", "B0064NTZKI", "B000021Y77", "B001G9F9IW", "0812978110", "1602585350", "B00006RCNV", "B008220DGE", "B000056KMW", "B00AEFXESQ", "B00005JKG9", "0802142036", "0792846052", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B00003CXC9", "B00HE010QM", "B00JAQJNN0", "B000GIXE86", "B001D8W7EK", "B0006TPDPM", "B000EBD9SU", "B000LXH0AE", "B00000K3CS", "B000Z8GZYW", "B00K0PA9ME", "B000TXNDV6", "B00A1O0G5E", "B00000G02H", "B00G7QPYX4", "B000069HZU", "B000063K2Q", "B0045HCJ9E", "B003102JDM", "B0009298N4", "B00005U2KC", "0767812158", "B00002E20R", "B00023P4JW", "B00AEFYSWM", "B00H9HZITU", "B00H9KKGTO", "B000ETRCN0", "B002LMV7QG", "B00HXH00ZI", "B00003CWRX", "0784011710"], "bought_together": ["B00005O06J", "0792846109"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0767819764", "B00005O06J", "6304907729", "0792846109"]}, "price": 39.95, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 323951}, "asin": "6305075328", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DH178S0SL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Crimes and Misdemeanors"}
{"description": "Sam Peckinpah weighs in on World War II--and from the German point of view. The result is as bleak, if not quite as bloody, as one expects, in part because the 1977 film was cut to ribbons by nervous studio executives. The assorted excerpts that remain don't constitute an exhilarating or even an especially thrilling battle epic. The war is grinding to a close, and veterans like James Coburn's Steiner are grimly aware that it's a lost cause. The battlefield is a death trap of sucking mud and barbed wire, and the German generals (viz., the martinet played by James Mason) seem to pose a bigger threat to the life and limbs of Steiner's men than the inexorable enemy. Not even Peckinpah's famous sensuous exuberance when shooting violence is much in evidence; the picture is a depressive, claustrophobically overcast experience.

{"description": "Changes must be expected when a classic book or stage show becomes a movie. In  this 1939Mikado, efforts were made to respect the original. Stars of the D'Oyly  Carte Company were hired for key roles and performed them in their  traditional style, with the D'Oyly Carte Chorus, London Symphony Orchestra, and a director (Victor Schertzinger) who was also a conductor and knew the music.An introductory scene was added to clarify the plot, and other small adjustments were made. Several songs were left out or abbreviated, and one song, \"The sun, whose rays,\" was sung twice, by Nanki-Poo and by Yum-Yum, for whom it was written. A popular tenor of the time, Kenny Baker, sang Nanki-Poo with good, light tone, but in his own non-traditional style.

{"description": "The 1998 testosterone-saturated blow-'em-up from producer Jerry Bruckheimer and director Michael Bay (The Rock,Bad Boys) continues Hollywood's millennium-fueled fascination with the destruction of our planet. There's no arguing that the successful duo understands what mainstream American audiences want in their blockbuster movies--loads of loud, eye-popping special effects, rapid- fire pacing, and patriotic flag waving. Bay's protagonists--the eight crude, lewd, oversexed (but lovable, of course) oil drillers summoned to save the world from a Texas-sized meteor hurling toward the earth--are not flawless heroes, but common men with whom all can relate. In this huge Western-in-space soap opera, they're American cowboys turned astronauts. Sci-fi buffs will appreciate Bay's fetishizing of technology, even though it's apparent he doesn't understand it as anything more than flashing lights and shiny gadgets. Smartly, the duo also tries to lure the art-house crowd, raiding the local indie acting stable and populating the film with guys like Steve Buscemi, Billy Bob Thornton, Owen Wilson, and Michael Duncan, all adding needed touches of humor and charisma. When Bay applies his sledgehammer aesthetics to the action portions of the film, it's mindless fun; it's only whenArmageddontackles humanity that it becomes truly offensive. Not sinceMississippi Burninghave racial and cultural stereotypes been substituted for characters so blatantly--African Americans, Japanese, Chinese, Scottish, Samoans, Muslims, French ... if it's not white and American, Bay simplifies it. Or, make that whitemaleAmerica; the film features only three notable females--four if you count the meteor, who's constantly referred to as a \"bitch that needs drillin',\" but she's a hell of a lot more developed and unpredictable than the other women characters combined. Sure, Bay's film creates some tension and contains some visceral moments, but if he can't create any redeemable characters outside of those in space, what's the point of saving the planet?--Dave McCoy", "related": {"also_bought": ["6304681496", "6304233639", "0783222475", "0792845684", "B00003CXTF", "B00004WIDB", "B00000JGEN", "0792151712", "B000007OY0", "B0001DI5W6", "0783222955", "6302610702", "079213690X", "6302909023", "6300215830", "6301976622", "6301643410"], "bought_together": ["6304681496"], "also_viewed": ["6301398912", "630382790X", "6304233639", "6300214540", "6303257844", "B000003KHS", "0792151712", "B000059XYK", "0800125762", "B00005JM5E", "6302415853", "B00005PJ8I", "0783241542", "B00003CXTF"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 194393}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.38, "brand": "Touchstone Home Video", "asin": "6305169187", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515Y886RQYL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Armageddon [VHS]"}
{"description": "If you were a kid in the early 1960s, then you sawThe Parent Trapwith Hayley Mills--it's as simple as that. Now Disney has pulled the beloved comedy--about a pair of twins who meet for the first time at summer camp and vow to reunite their long-divorced parents--out of the mothballs and remade it with a decidedly '90s feel. This time, the twins act is performed by newcomer Lindsay Lohan, who plays both Hallie and Annie, who each live with one of their parents (Dennis Quaid and Natasha Richardson). Adversaries when they first meet at camp, Hallie and Annie become, well, sisters when they figure out that they are siblings. The comedy springs from their efforts to sabotage Dad's impending marriage to the gold-digging Elaine Hendrix, while reintroducing Dad to Mom. Quaid has a nice, loosey-goosey way with slapstick, as does Richardson, who plays a very funny drunk scene.--Marshall Fine", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000022WA", "6303998046", "080013558X", "0788812181", "6302968143", "6305229449", "0788805843", "078880782X", "B00005JMCW", "0788802194", "0788812408", "6304401132", "B00063KGPU", "6304500718", "6302787068", "0788809806", "B0000E32WB", "B00008X5J8", "6305318867", "155890641X", "6300274268", "6302320402", "6303929567", "B0002YLCHE", "B000FCW15A", "B00005T7H6", "6304500831", "0788806270", "B00005RDVV", "B0009X75QU", "B00005JKX3", "B00000IZ00", "B00001YX9H", "6305319138", "6300274195", "6302526574", "6304089201", "B00005JKDQ", "6304293968", "6303929478", "6304100507", "6305940932", "6304401736", "0788810677", "B0001906WC", "B00003CXHR", "6302961572", "6302158095", "B000063V8N", "0788810634", "B00003CXQX", "0788816454", "6303232221", "B00005JM9Q", "6300275310", "B0000A02WB", "6304089767", "6303314015", "6302642248", "6304117752", "B000209KMW", "B00003CWPW", "6302581907", "B00004XPQQ", "6304416415", "B00005T7H1", "6300214753", "B000F4PDF8", "B00005JM9P", "6303925235", "6303066720", "B00000J2JB", "630341964X", "B00003CXG6", "6304311834", "630339406X", "B00005NGTF", "B00000F8J1", "B00329TVQA", "B00006G8LB", "6302914469", "B00005JLYP", "0800196767", "B00006L97W", "B0002MB7R6", "630450389X", "6303442447", "B000A468XY", "6305009589", "B00000490M", "6302453356", "B00005JKYF", "B0000D14JV", "6304118937", "B0002KQ6UG", "B00065GWMO", "B00007AJLB", "6305515042", "B00003CXDU"], "bought_together": ["B0000022WA"], "also_viewed": ["B0009X75QU", "B0000022WA", "6303983812", "6304400551", "080013558X", "6303534422", "B00005RRG9", "0788812807", "0788805843", "0788811002", "6303315305", "B00005RRG6", "6302968143", "B000035Z2S", "6304401132", "6304089201", "6303122647", "0788812181", "B0007KTBIU", "6301390725", "B00004R99N", "6303998046", "6301948106", "0788802194", "6303442447", "6302178924", "6304285388", "B000009CH0", "B0000524CZ", "6304501153", "6303168957", "6304311834", "155890641X", "6302787068", "0788812408", "B00000JS61", "B0001I55OW", "6304100507", "B00003CXQX", "6305318867", "B008H6GH9W", "B00005JKDQ", "6305326940", "078880782X", "6303036813", "B000055ZJP", "0788811207", "6304089112", "6302320402", "6305229449", "6304293968"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 90200}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6305177473", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51FFFRBR3KL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Parent Trap (Walt Disney Pictures Presents) [VHS]"}

Hot on the tail of this tape is a ruthless group of National Security Agents commanded by a belligerently ambitious fed named Reynolds (Jon Voight).

Driven by acute paranoia, Dean enlists the help of a clandestine former NSA operative named Brill (Gene Hackman), andEnemy of the Statekicks into high-intensity hyperdrive.Teaming up once again with producer Jerry Bruckheimer,Top Gundirector Tony Scott demonstrates his glossy style with clever cinematography and breakneck pacing. Will Smith proves that there's more to his success than a brash sense of humor, giving a versatile performance that plausibly illustrates a man cracking under the strain of paranoid turmoil.

Most of all, the film's depiction of high-tech surveillance is highly convincing and dramatically compelling, making this a cautionary tale with more substance than you'd normally expect from a Scott-Bruckheimer action extravaganza.--Jeremy Storey", "related": {"also_bought": ["0790732149", "B002AS464Q", "B002AT8K9W", "B000JYW5BE", "6304765258", "B00AEFXYJA", "B001NY4WYC", "B002NZK5UU", "B00008G8M4", "B00AEFXT1S", "B000NTMA0Q", "B0045HCJFS", "B002AT8KA6", "0790736411", "0783226888", "6304806434", "B00015YVDG", "6304711891", "B000CEV3M8", "B00005JN0T", "B00000G3PA", "B003ASLJIQ", "B005LAIGRS", "B001L57ZYM", "B00005JKMQ", "B000OT6V0K", "B00005ATZT", "B0007KIFGE", "B000055Y0Y", "B000QUCRB4", "B00096S49Y", "0767803434", "B004IK30MI", "B00AEFYW64", "B000B8GT92", "B00005JL78", "B000ENC5YW", "B00005UQ9T", "B001B3LIOC", "B002NZK5R8", "B000VG66XS", "B00008OE4W", "B000EGDB10", "B00008K76U", "B00003CXFV", "6304884400", "B000GFLKF8", "B00AEBB8LA", "B00AEFXIIW", "B002NZK5VO", "B00008K76W", "B002GOAH1A", "B00BTYOYG2", "B002GHHHME", "B00014NEZI", "0783240295", "B000P5FH3K", "B003O7I6SE", "B00005JPD0", "B007FQXEWI", "B004EPYZP8", "B00005JA9F", "B000035P5V", "B002DU39GW", "B003BV8I3Q", "0783232098", "B00AEBB86U", "6305428506", "B001TODCII", "B00003CXGV", "0780618548", "B002AT8KAG", "B00AP2DC94", "B00AEFXBG6", "B00026ZG10", "B00BEIYN9Q", "B0006GANOQ", "B000E0WJLE", "B00441GYXI", "B00005B6JZ", "B00A2H9P98", "B00004ZBVG", "B003A12WBQ", "B00011CZRE", "B0013J55B6", "B00AEFYUQQ", "0792844874", "B00006HAWN", "0792159659", "B00AEBB9UK", "0790730979", "B00009WVSL", "B002O3Z4ZW", "B000059TFO", "B0045HCJ8K", "B00006JDVT", "0783225733", "B000E5KURY", "B00029RT9E", "B000TGJ8CQ"], "bought_together": ["B002AS464Q"], "buy_after_viewing": ["6304765258", "B00008G8M4", "B005LAIGRS", "B003ASLJIQ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 3843}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.99, "brand": "Buena Vista", "asin": "6305428115", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51QR8SZKK7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Enemy of the State"}
{"description": "French director Fran&ccedil;ois Truffaut once said, \"Our New Wave would  never have come into being if it hadn't been for the young Morris Engel, with his fineLittle Fugitive.\" High praise indeed, and as Truffaut observed, this early milestone of American independent filmmaking had a powerful influence on such later French classics asThe Red Balloonand Truffaut's ownLes MistonsandThe 400 Blows.Codirected by Ray Ashley, Morris Engel, and Ruth Orkin, and photographed by Engel in New York during the summer of 1952, the film tells the simple story of a 7-year-old Brooklyn boy named Joey (charmingly played by nonactor Richie Andrusco), who flees to Coney Island after a mischievous prank leads Joey to believe he's accidentally killed his older brother Lennie. With six dollars in his pocket, Joey indulges himself with amusement rides and junk food, and as the weekend progresses, Lennie begins an equally adventurous search for his missing kid brother.Winner of the Silver Lion award at the 1953 Venice Film Festival and Oscar nominee for Best Story,Little Fugitivewas inducted into the prestigious National Film Registry in 1997. Making innovative use of a hand-held camera (which impressed Engel's friend Stanley Kubrick, who used the same equipment for his debut featureFear and Desire), the film favors image over dialogue, and unfolds with timeless and universal appeal. A pleasure from start to finish,Little Fugitiveis a little masterpiece that you'll never forget.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000CNEQWS", "B005Z3EAYE", "B0012Z361M", "B001G7ID1E", "B001DRF82O", "B000059H74", "B0083V2W04", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B0009X75O2", "B004ODLUIU", "B00AEFYTMQ", "B0000BWVCR", "B004H0M2UK", "B00AEFY9GW", "B00027JYLC", "B005152C7S", "6305131104", "B002LBKE0C", "B005OT80W2", "B00BJB2GRO", "B001LMU1C8", "B001TIQT6G", "B0074JOD2G", "B004XVMCQ2", "B00GBT629C", "B00DZP1BVO", "B0006B2A7E", "0792845773", "B000296E7W", "B002X9S6RK", "B000CBG5PG", "B000244EYW", "B004CNK59C", "B008JEJSB6", "B000A5046K", "B00004RFHN", "B00002E20R", "B00AF4OTM6", "B00006RCNV", "B001JPQWSE", "B001BSBBDK", "B004SIPAJG", "B004UOHNAC", "B001THZAAI", "B00AEBB89C", "B0087ZG7OI", "B00F98FOI6"], "bought_together": ["B000CNEQWS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000CNEQWS", "B000059H74", "B001DRF82O", "B001G7ID1E"]}, "price": 39.9, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 299334}, "asin": "6305473102", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51VT72J26KL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Little Fugitive"}

Or what exactly fascinated student filmmaker Heather and what possibly took her, Mike, and Josh from this earth? Get all your background questions answered byCurse of the Blair Witch, a one-stop-shopping \"documentary\" originally produced for the Sci-Fi Channel as a tie-in marketing tool. Entirely fictionalized,Curse of the Blair Witchfocuses both on the past and the present, with copious info on the Blair Witch myth as well as on the disappearance of Heather, Josh, and Mike. As it turns out, the original witch was one Elly Kedward, who was accused in 1785 of taking blood from several children; she was subsequently banished to the harsh winter woods and left for dead. Her grisly and bloody legacy involves missing children, polluted water, disemboweled men, and a serial killer of children who claims to have been haunted by \"an old woman ghost.\" Aside from some ineffective \"newsreel\" footage of the serial killer, all this intriguing information is presented convincingly and chillingly.Cursemay in fact freak you out more than the movie, and it evokes the great, pulpyIn Search Ofseries of the '70s, one of the prime inspirations for filmmakers Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez. News clips of the search for Heather, Josh, and Mike lend a v&eacute;rit&eacute; atmosphere to the proceedings, but shed little light on their mysterious disappearance or their characters.

{"description": "Let's get this straight: Drew Barrymore started a production company to develop original scripts outside of Hollywood and the first project she chose to produce was this, a romantic comedy written by USC grads Abby Kohn and Mark Silverstein about a nerdy, virginal woman who returns to high school as an undercover reporter, finally gets to be popular, and falls in love. And Barrymore decided, as producer, that the perfect actress to play this virtuous, clean-cut, and downright annoying geek would be... Drew Barrymore?

The jokes fall flat, the romance between Barrymore and her English teacher (played by Michael Vartan) lacks chemistry, and the portrayals of high school and the newspaper newsroom is clich&eacute;d and uninspired (big surprise here: the director, Raja Gosnell, previously madeHome Alone 3).

{"description": "Matthew Broderick makes up for years of wet-noodle performances with his low-key but unsparing characterization of Jim McAllister, a high school teacher at George Washington Carver High School in Omaha, Nebraska. Driven by a strange mixture of loathing and lust for pathologically overachieving student Tracy Flick (Reese Witherspoon), McAllister encourages a dim but popular athlete, Paul (Chris Klein fromAmerican Pie), to run against her in the election for student-council president. Director-cowriter Alexander Payne (Citizen Ruth) turns this deceptively simple premise into a complex and scathing comedy of ambition, corruption, and desire, all at its most naked and petty. Every scene contains some painfully funny nuance that will make you wince in a mixture of astonishment and empathy. Witherspoon flips effortlessly back and forth from adolescent vulnerability to steely-eyed strength; she's becoming a contemporary Carole Lombard. The movie itself feels like a magnificent throwback to the richly layered comedies of the '30s, which drew their humor from sharply drawn characters and twisting plots instead of explosions of bodily fluids.

{"description": "Sean Connery plays a master thief thought to be long retired, while Catherine Zeta-Jones is his foil, a hotshot insurance investigator assigned to his case. They both have a little something to hold over each other's heads, until it turns out that Zeta-Jones is a professional art thief herself and is playing on both sides of the fence. At first they eye each other with mutual distrust until they team up for a job, which goes off without a hitch. Inevitably their prickly relationship begins to thaw somewhat, and the two become attracted to each other as they plan out the massive Y2K bank scam that is the movie's climax (complete with sequel-ready ending).Entrapmentplays somewhat like a '70s caper movie revamped for the gadget-happy high-tech '90s. The plot takes a few too many labored twists and turns, and the chemistry between the two leads is nearly nonexistent, though both carry on gamely in their parts. On the other hand, there is some genuine suspense in many scenes as they go about their business, dripping with whiz-bang burglary devices. Zeta-Jones, of course, is drop-dead gorgeous, and Connery is as reliable as always in his role. The fairly flat editing and direction tends to drag the film down somewhat, but fans of caper movies, high-tech thrillers, and the two leads should find plenty to like in this film.--Jerry Renshaw", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00006IUNT", "6304925131", "079212569X", "0792133153", "0792116887", "B0000048TX", "6303696813", "0790731975", "6303313345", "6304258984", "0783223218", "0800125762", "B00004WIDB", "B00000IO4G", "0783216084", "6303020089", "0790748169", "6300183211"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 212089}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6305622825", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/7179VDAPNGL._SY300_.gif", "title": "Entrapment [VHS]"}

{"description": "The French director Jacques Demy scored a worldwide hit in 1964 withThe Umbrellas of Cherbourg, a bittersweet candy-colored romance in which all the dialogue was set to music. Equally enchanting is the musical that reunited Demy with the star and composer ofUmbrellas, Catherine Deneuve and Michel Legrand. The film isThe Young Girls of Rochefort, an effervescent concoction about traveling players and dreamy-headeddemoisellesin a seaside town. Deneuve and her real-life sister, Fran&#xE7;oise Dorl&#xE9;ac (who died in a car accident not long after the movie was made), play twins who fantasize about life in Paris. But before they leave town, they are distracted by the weekend fair and its colorful singers and dancers. They're also destined to meet an American composer--gloriously, it's Gene Kelly, carrying the aura of classic MGM musicals in his lighter-than-air wake. He was 55 at the time, but much younger in movie years. (Another American, George Chakiris, also dances his way through the film.) Legrand's music isn't as powerful as hisCherbourgscore, and some of the choreography would fit right into anAustin Powersdiscotheque sequence. And the costumes--well, the excesses of '60s mod designs have not aged well. Yet the crazy hairstyles and vinyl boots fit right into the film's sense of gleeful fun. There is a sunny, daffy spirit to this movie that becomes positively infectious. It deserves to be better known.

{"description": "The only true \"film noir\" ever directed by a woman, this tour de force thriller (considered by many, including Lupino herself, to be her best film) is a classic, tension-packed, three-way dance of death about two middle-class American homebodies (Edmond O'Brien and Frank Lovejoy) on vacation in Mexico on a long-awaited fishing trip. Suddenly their car and their very lives are commandeered by psychopathic serial killer Emmett Myers (William Talman). The striking light/dark contrasts, the stunning compositions (the two kidnap victims separated by a narrow stream from a gun-cradling madman with a bum eye) and the spatial integrity of a determining sense of locale (the pitiless topography of a rock-bound, horizonless Mexico over which hovers an ever-present doom) all contribute mightily to this fascinating character-study.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00004W19C", "B000PMFRVU", "B004C2523M", "B009X919UE", "B00E18QKJ2", "B0024FAG8A", "B001CC7PM6", "B000RXVND8", "B00DZP1C9K", "B00IBKXS2I", "B0080JG2GE", "B00EL6A7XE", "B0024FAG80", "B0000C8AVT", "B0086IMP9M", "6305770328", "B000244EWY", "B00KIZY3XW", "B000EXDSBQ", "B0006Z2NE0", "B000B8384Q", "B00HRISNPM", "B0089LT800", "B00JX3SHIC", "B00AQ6J5YA", "B00I567EWS", "B00DZP1BVO", "B000B83846", "B0024FAG6W", "B00E6AVGKI", "B000244EZ6", "B00E21D9ME", "B00I9BU60Q", "B004CZZZUY", "B00006II5J", "B005152C9G", "B00023P4GA", "B000244EX8", "B00005AUK9", "B00FPUN21O", "B000244EWO", "B00BGARG3C", "B00AB2NX4M", "B003G9IT3C", "B00BM4Q46M", "6305999872", "B00AEFXRWO", "B00H8J2NTC", "B003M0NLXS", "B000244EYW", "B00IF0KAYS", "B00ICWO1LC", "B001CC7PLW", "B00D9EJFV4", "B00B27WQ6G", "B00005Y70U", "B000BGH2NG", "B002YNQEFG", "B000H0HF92", "B000CNE088", "B000FI9OCW", "B00I9BU3L8", "B0060KGSFU", "B000TLTCT0", "B0007ZEO7S", "B00008G8WL", "B00065GX64", "B0000694WH", "B00DO0MEOS", "B0009GX1CE", "B00I116MVQ", "B00005RDRL", "B0006UEVVI", "B004H0M2UK", "B00CVB6XF2", "B0087ZG7OI", "0783229488", "B00J2CB9BQ", "B008BSM1CI", "B000PKG7CA", "B00D09AXUA", "B00CUKTGSA", "B00FX6U19Q", "B00C3ALM02", "B000087F79", "B00DBE97S8", "B0010KHOSU", "B0000AZKO7", "B00FX6TYZS", "B004DSCMLA", "B00DZFKN54", "B000GRUQK6", "B00D9EJFZA", "B000RXVNDI", "B003YY2886", "B0009X7678", "B0007TKNHY", "B008D19ZPY", "B000N3T0H8", "B00FMGPWNW"], "bought_together": ["B00004W19C"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00E18QKJ2", "B000PMFRVU", "B0087ZG7OI", "6305999872"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 293694}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 17.78, "brand": "Kino International", "asin": "6305683875", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51BM43Y34ML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Hitch-Hiker"}

{"description": "This epic 10-hour miniseries from the Emmy-winning writer ofGulliver's Travelswas a ratings bust on television, but on video and DVD, where it can be enjoyed at one's leisure, it has a better chance to cast its magical spell. Kimberly Williams has never been more enchanting than as Virginia, a waitress who still lives with her janitor father (John Larroquette) and yearns for something exciting to happen to her. Her wish comes true when she and her father are transported from New York City into a dimension that, with apologies to Rod Serling, can only be called the Fairy Tale Zone; nine kingdoms populated by characters from fairy tales of yore. They team up with a dog who's really a prince--Wendell, grandson of Snow White--changed into canine form by the evil Queen (Dianne Wiest), who plots to usurp Wendell's throne. Father, daughter, and his royal dogness are relentlessly pursued through the nine kingdoms by the Troll King (Ed O'Neill) and his three bumbling and horrible children, and the conflicted Wolf (Scott Cohen), who is allied with the Queen but, with the aid of some Oprah-esque self-help books, tames his inner beast and falls in love with Virginia.The 10th Kingdomis a special effects extravaganza. There is indeed, as one character marvels, magic to behold here. But despite the Hallmark brand name and the presence of a grown-up Snow White (Camryn Manheim) and Cinderella (Ann-Margret), bewitched animals, magic mirrors, and trolls, this is not kid's stuff. It can get scary, surprisingly violent, and quite intense; you know, just like real fairy tales.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"bought_together": ["B00B04NIZO"], "also_viewed": ["B00B04NIZO", "1575665379", "B00HZMZ2HM", "B00005AW83", "B00BUWD7WA", "B0031DDG9A", "B00BEZTMFY", "B00JPS6A3O"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 362662}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 13.97, "brand": "", "asin": "6305818282", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51C9G8D1BCL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The 10th Kingdom [VHS]"}

But before Stewart can reveal the truth, his true identity is discovered and he becomes a victim of his own ruse. With the help of a deranged punch-drunk ex-prizefighter (Tor Johnson of Plan 9 From Outer Space), the doctors at La Siesta Sanitarium concoct a plan to make Stewart a permanent resident. And the only person who shares Stewart's secret, the only one who can rescue him from certain death, is the scheming woman who sent him there.

{"description": "This complex and intriguing drama chronicles--with some probable narrative liberties--the chain of events that instigated the provocative Profumo affair, the infamous cold war scandal that toppled Britain's conservative government in the early 1960s. John Hurt stars as charming osteopath Stephen Ward, who grooms a malleable and beautiful teen showgirl, Christine Keeler (Joanne Whalley-Kilmer), to party with his swinging high-society friends. Trouble starts brewing when Christine becomes simultaneously entangled with both a Russian diplomat and a British cabinet minister. Once the media learn of her sexual escapades, the reigning Conservative Party comes under fire and begins seeking a scapegoat to distract the public from the dangerous political implications that the affairs represent. Under Michael Caton-Jones's confident direction, the film generates sympathy for its decadent lead characters, and it intelligently explores how private personal matters become vulgar public affairs when political machinations intrude. The most intriguing aspect ofScandalis the platonic love affair between Keeler and Ward amid the trials and tribulations of their stormy relationship--think of it as a twisted variation onMy Fair Lady. The fine cast also includes Ian McKellan as John Profumo and Bridget Fonda as Christine's partner-in-fun Mandy Rice-Davies. The uncut DVD version features a little more skin than the R-rated release, although viewers will probably wonder why those few extra shots caused such a stir.--Bryan Reesman", "related": {"also_bought": ["0790750643", "B000053VAT", "B0016I0AKU", "B00004ZBVM", "B00K2CHUWW", "B00AEFYD2M", "B00JJ3EHCG", "B0049TVHSC", "0007435851", "B00GRZPRB4", "0224023470", "B004ULEENE", "B00FR23S3W", "B0007W6HVM", "B007MDB6Y2", "B00005B8U4", "B00006L91I", "B009M7PR5A", "B004YMATCY", "B0045O2PHS", "B000QXDFRG", "B002UJIY2A", "B004SUDQC2", "B0000D0YXV", "B006M3M5FM", "B007RGB58G", "B00005JMU1", "B00005U2K5", "B00000DTOM", "B005VUTRGW", "B00IVLRC88", "B002E01M8I", "B00008L3S6", "B00DL48BM6", "B00J5LXT44", "B0002V7O5Q", "B0012IV3Q4", "B00GS08Y3Q", "B00ET2ODTE", "B00005K3NU", "B00HF98SPS", "B004SIP9CO", "B0047DKLCI", "B003Z8ZC2A", "149093989X", "B005ZVIPG0", "B000SKU04S", "B00EP2SN58", "6305428522", "B00J5364N0", "B00EVU3T26", "B004OUZLGA", "B00EALTWHW", "B008SGVSMM", "B008RO6PJQ", "B00004TWZH", "B0000BXMZ3", "B00007ELDG", "B00ESZZOLI", "B000A7Q1UQ", "B000HT3QBO", "B0047UJBJA", "B001EOQCJE", "B004KNO798", "B00004ZBVO", "1843587556", "B001E0ADF2", "0330481673", "B00014K5YG", "B00009YXHG", "B000CBG5PG", "B00005R5GD", "B00020X88Y", "B00GPPXNIK", "B006Z7Z3VS", "B002ONC9NC", "B00013RC66", "B001CW7ZT4", "B00AZESO72", "0792846486", "B00049QJBG", "B00005V9HM", "B00014NE62", "1452122199", "B00005U2KC", "B00AN5LCXQ", "B00003CXSA", "B00005K3NV", "B003EYVXSW", "B005UVTTOM", "B001AXL67W", "B00FMGPWD2", "B00AEK9BKQ", "B00005JMIJ", "B006OT0UUQ", "B000059TG7", "B00GICP84W", "0792845803"], "bought_together": ["B007MDB6Y2", "B009M7PR5A"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B007MDB6Y2", "B009M7PR5A", "B00FR23S3W", "B0016I0AKU"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 195343}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 54.5, "brand": "", "asin": "6305971196", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/415XT0KB44L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Scandal"}
{"description": "John Lasseter and his gang of high-tech creators at Pixar create another entertainment for the ages. Like the few great movie sequels,Toy Story&nbsp;2comments on why the first one was so wonderful while finding a fresh angle worthy of a new film. The craze of toy collecting becomes the focus here, as we find out Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks) is not only a beloved toy to Andy but also a rare doll from a popular '60s children's show. When a greedy collector takes Woody, Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) launches a rescue mission with Andy's other toys. To say more would be a crime because this is one of the most creative and smile-inducing films since, well, the firstToy Story.Although the toys look the same as in the 1994 feature, Pixar shows how much technology has advanced: the human characters look more human, backgrounds are superior, and two action sequences that book-end the film are dazzling. And it's a hoot for kids and adults. The film is packed with spoofs, easily accessible in-jokes, and inspired voice casting (with newcomer Joan Cusack especially a delight as Cowgirl Jessie). But as the Pixar canon of films illustrates, the filmmakers are storytellers first. Woody's heart-tugging predicament can easily be translated into the eternal debate of living a good life versus living  forever.Toy Story&nbsp;2also achieved something in the U.S. two other outstanding 1999 animated features (The Iron Giant,Princess Mononoke) could not: it became a huge box-office hit.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["6304089767", "B00005JKDQ", "B0000AQZYM", "6305326940", "0788805843", "0788812408", "155890641X", "6303314015", "0788802194", "B000035Z2S", "0788805533", "6305229449", "078881172X", "6304500831", "0788812807", "6302526574", "6302642248", "6303983812", "B00003CXQX", "6304401132", "0788806270", "6302787068", "6305940932", "6302320402", "6304290888", "6303534422", "B00275EHJG", "B00004T2SI", "6305319138", "B00005JL95", "0788803743", "6302178924", "6300274268", "6304100507", "6305942285", "B00004R99N", "6300275310", "B00006CXK5", "B00003CXXI", "B00005JMQY", "6304400225", "6304400551", "6302961572", "6303122647", "6304501153", "B00005JKX3", "0788811002", "6300274195", "B0000E32WB", "6303929338", "B00005T7H6", "6304978286", "B00005RDVV", "B00016JF2W", "6302158095", "B0000524CZ", "6304401736", "B000035Z46", "B00003CXHR", "0788812440", "6303036813", "6304089201", "B0007A2GSM", "B00000JS61", "B000028U3S", "B00005RRG3", "6301991311", "B00003CWPW", "B00009L4S1", "6304400381", "6300274608", "B00003CXQ6", "B00000I7Q3", "0788812181", "B000AY74OQ", "6305559295", "0792153677", "B00005LOUS", "0788809806", "078880720X", "B000009CTR", "1558906150", "B00001YX9H", "6301390725", "B00007AJLB", "B00000J2JA", "6304434340", "0783221800", "B00000ICHA", "1558907718", "6303148387", "B00004T2SJ", "6304155972", "6303939015", "0788810448", "6301404440", "630169774X", "B00003CXQ0", "6302968143", "B00006IUM9"], "also_viewed": ["6304089767", "6303314015", "B00005JKDQ", "B0000AQZYM", "0788805843", "6302787068", "0788812408", "6305326940", "155890641X", "0788805533", "0788802194", "6305940932", "6302320402", "078881172X", "6305229449", "6302526574", "6304500831", "B000035Z2S", "B00003CXQX", "6303983812", "6302642248", "6304100507", "6300274195", "6304290888", "0788812807", "0788806270", "6303036813", "6300274268", "6305319138", "B00005JL95", "6304501153", "6300275310", "B00004T2SI", "6303534422", "6305942285", "6302178924", "B00003CXXI", "6304401132", "6302961572", "B0007KTBIU", "6304400551", "6303929338", "6304089201", "B00004R99N", "6304978286", "B0000524CZ", "B00275EHJG", "B00005JKX3", "B00000I7Q3", "B00003CXHR", "6304089112", "6302426200", "B0000E32WB", "B00006CXK5", "B0030IIZ4M", "6305310068", "6304401736", "B00016JF2W", "B000063V8N"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 182756}, "asin": "6305949557", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515BCFM46JL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Toy Story 2 [VHS]"}
{"description": "Generally acknowledged as a bona fide classic, this Francis Ford Coppola film is one of those rare experiences that feels perfectly right from beginning to end--almost as if everyone involved had been born to participate in it. Based on Mario Puzo's bestselling novel about a Mafia dynasty, Coppola'sGodfatherextracted and enhanced the most universal themes of immigrant experience in America: the plotting-out of hopes and dreams for one's successors, the raising of children to carry on the good work, etc. In the midst of generational strife during the Vietnam years, the film somehow struck a chord with a nation fascinated by the metamorphosis of a rebellious son (Al Pacino) into the keeper of his father's dream. Marlon Brando played against Puzo's own conception of patriarch Vito Corleone, and time has certainly proven the actor correct. The rest of the cast, particularly James Caan, John Cazale, and Robert Duvall as the rest of Vito's male brood--all coping with how to take the mantle of responsibility from their father--is seamless and wonderful.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["630021639X", "6302158176", "6300183211", "6304214502", "6300214826", "0790705141", "6303168507", "0790733927", "B00003CXE6", "630470786X", "6300267997", "0790741512", "6303471501", "6300271331", "6302054982", "6303686796", "B00005PJ8I", "B00004COR2", "0792842111", "6304258984", "6304509146", "0783216084", "6300215644", "6300216500", "B000062XM6", "0800199421", "B0002F6BQU", "0800116917", "630336568X", "6304508611", "B00000F13T", "6304935811", "6305363668", "B000005PFL", "6300182878", "0792116887", "6300182452", "B00005B238", "0792845684", "6300247171", "0792839846", "6302482712", "6302989787", "0790732017", "0800100832", "630442972X", "6304196954", "B000065U6Q", "6301208773", "B00000K2SC", "6302842263", "6304429274", "6303313345", "B0000A36J1", "B000059XY5", "079212569X"], "bought_together": ["630021639X", "6302158176"], "also_viewed": ["6302610702", "630021639X", "6301792734", "6303402348", "6300215830", "6304117752", "6300183211", "6302158176", "B00COYZF5A", "6300214060", "B000NTPDSW", "6305095566", "0792151712", "6305169187", "6303953425", "080010367X", "6302054982", "6301208773", "B000KX0ISG", "630310696X", "6302415853", "6304214502", "B00005B238", "6303168507", "B00E9PMMX0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 270877}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.98, "brand": "", "asin": "B000003KHS", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/11KQ3QC757L.jpg", "title": "The Godfather [VHS]"}
{"description": "Edward Scissorhandsachieves the nearly impossible feat of capturing the delicate flavor of a fable or fairy tale in a live-action movie. The story follows a young man named Edward (Johnny Depp), who was created by an inventor (Vincent Price, in one of his last roles) who died before he could give the poor creature a pair of human hands. Edward lives alone in a ruined Gothic castle that just happens to be perched above a pastel-colored suburb inhabited by breadwinning husbands and frustrated housewives straight out of the 1950s. One day, Peg (Dianne Wiest), the local Avon lady, comes calling. Finding Edward alone, she kindly invites him to come home with her, where she hopes to help him with his pasty complexion and those nasty nicks he's given himself with his razor-sharp fingers. Soon Edward's skill with topiary sculpture and hair design make him popular in the neighborhood--but the mood turns just as swiftly against the outsider when he starts to feel his own desires, particularly for Peg's daughter Kim (Winona Ryder). Most of director Tim Burton's movies (such asPee Wee's Big Adventure,Beetlejuice,Batman) are visual spectacles with elements of fantasy, butEdward Scissorhandsis more tender and personal than the others. Edward's wild black hair is much like Burton's, suggesting that the character represents the director's own feelings of estrangement and co-option. Johnny Depp, making his first successful leap from TV to film, captures Edward's childlike vulnerability even while his physical posture evokes horror icons like the vampire inNosferatuand the sleepwalker inThe Cabinet of Dr. Caligari. Classic horror films, at their heart, feel a deep sympathy for the monsters they portray; simply and affectingly,Edward Scissorhandslays that heart bare.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B001AGXEA6", "B008MU8ZM0", "B00AEBBA1I", "B00AEBB9V4", "B008UZBHYU", "B000I5XOWI", "B003UMW68Y", "B0065AO94W", "B001EZE5BU", "B008BSM1GO", "B008QE9VJI", "B0043EV774", "B00GR76W1Q", "B005LAIIA8", "B000M9BPEY", "B005DZ35RC", "B007NPKPN2", "B002UOMGZQ", "B00288KNJU", "B003M8NG94", "B004P29LEU", "B008U0XRD4", "B005DZ35TU", "B000JSI7B2", "B001O8DB1W", "B000NA22C6", "B002S6L6XY", "B000002OFD", "B004VLZUI6", "B0088EDMMS", "B005HARX4Y", "B004SIP7QC", "B001AQR3E4", "B00AJCUL2G", "B003L4Y5B2", "B0039208JE", "B0054QHHHE", "B002QEHPR4", "B0027VTMAE", "B001CO42MU", "B001AR4K8K", "B003UESJLK", "B001IKKMCW", "B000WUMLU0", "B006MOYH0M", "B00993FEUK", "B003ZHR6PW", "B00C888MJ8", "B001AQT0UY", "B00AEFXXFU", "B0039208QM", "B00164GDA0", "B005KQVDH8", "B001HN69B8", "B001D8W7CW", "B000WSLAUO", "B00005R87R", "B00FAI3JE6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001AGXEA6", "B008MU8ZM0", "B00AEBBA1I", "B008FD36IC"]}, "price": 8.5, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 449136}, "asin": "B000005QLO", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/511ADGQ59YL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Edward Scissorhands"}

Taken literally,Masked and Anonymousproves bewildering, even exasperating, but as a feverish act of unrestrained political satire the film has a lot to offer, including some of the best recent performances by Goodman, Lange, Jeff Bridges (as a cynical journalist), Val Kilmer (a babbling prophet), Luke Wilson (a musician), and Giovanni Ribisi (a haunted soldier).

{"description": "There's no rule against rock anthems from the 1970s in the soundtrack for a movie about a medieval jousting champion, but if you're going to attempt such jarring anachronisms, you'd better establish acceptable ground rules. Writer-director Brian Helgeland does precisely that inA Knight's Taleand pulls off this trick with such giddy aplomb that you can't help but play along. (Upon witnessing a crowd of peasants at a jousting match, singing and clapping to the beat of Queen's \"We Will Rock You,\" you're either going to love this movie or dismiss it altogether.) Other vintage rock hits will follow, but Helgeland--the Oscar&#xAE;-winning cowriter ofL.A. Confidential--handles this ploy with judicious goodwill, in what is an otherwise honest period piece about a peasant named William (Heath Ledger) who rises by grit and determination to the hallowed status of knighthood.As if the soundtrack weren't audacious enough, Helgeland (recovering from the sour experience of his directorial debut,Payback) casts none other than Geoffrey Chaucer (wonderfully played by Paul Bettany) as William's cohort and match announcer, along with William's pals Roland (Mark Addy) and Wat (Alan Tudyk), and feisty blacksmith Kate (Laura Fraser). Of course there must be a fair maiden, and she is Jocelyn (newcomer Shannyn Sossamon), with whom William falls in love while battling the nefarious Count Adhemar (Rufus Sewell) on the European jousting circuit. Add to this an inspiring father-son reunion, Ledger's undeniable charisma, a perfect supporting cast, and enough joyful energy to rejuvenate the film's formulaic plot, andA Knight's Talebecomes that most pleasant of movie surprises--an unlikely winner that rises up, like its hero, to exceed all expectations.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000EDWKXI", "0800141601", "B00447L4KA", "B00006ZXSK", "B004SEUIWY", "B002VWNID6", "B00004XPPG", "B00003CXC3", "B00005EBIL", "B000ARXF96", "B00AEFXKUI", "B004SUDQ40", "B001HN69AY", "B004SIP9U6", "0792839137", "B0002YLCG0", "B003UYUQZW", "B003FCKIGQ", "B000056VP4", "B002NZK5V4", "B00005JLO2", "B002O3Z50Q", "B002O3Z4XY", "B00AEFY5B6", "B000GGSMO4", "6305428077", "B00003CXG7", "B00004WG2F", "B00005JN0T", "B0010V4VJY", "B005ORVN00", "B00000JQB5", "6305428042", "6305123454", "0783225814", "B00AEBB9UU", "6305692688", "B0000WN0SW", "B000MGUZCU", "B00006ADFM", "B00005JKCH", "B00AMEZDJW", "B0000TPA0G", "B0000844I8", "B002GHHHHO", "0783240295", "B000K7VHQ4", "B00000K3UU", "B00005JKMN", "B000EPFCPE", "B0006GAI5U", "B0007IO6NM", "B002K0WBXW", "0767821513", "B00005QJJG", "B00008EYA5", "B00004Z4WR", "B00005JKNV", "B00005LOL0", "B004SIP6BI", "B00003CXHJ", "B002NXSRVG", "B002ZG999U", "B004SEUJ9Q", "0783233477", "B000T5O47Q", "B00F84H73Q", "B003U0AHBO", "B00004W4UD", "B00AEFXYOA", "B000AARKOO", "B00AEFZ6V4", "B00005JM5B", "B0001HLVS2", "6305428387", "B002GHHHME", "B000LC55F2", "B00AEBB8R4", "B007SPPANM", "B001GZ6QC4", "B00BLN4V46", "B000EGDB10", "0800195175", "B000FKO5QK", "B000U7WV1Y", "B00BTYSIWI", "B0038N9X3Q", "6305609764", "B000K4WPCC", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B00011CZRE", "B00005JMOW", "0800141741", "B00005JPD0", "B001DDBD4K", "B00008G7UF", "B000209KMW", "1558908382", "B004LWZWGA", "B0009RCPUW"], "bought_together": ["B00447L4KA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0800141601", "B00447L4KA", "B00003CXC3"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 7604}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.99, "brand": "Columbia Telecommunications", "asin": "B00000F4ZY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51rNtZ4oMwL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "A Knight's Tale (Special Edition)"}

{"description": "At first glance, Ren&eacute; Clair might seem an odd match for Agatha Christie's mystery thrillerTen Little Indians, but his buoyant touch is exactly what is missing from so many overly solemn remakes. Ten  strangers gather for a mysterious gathering on a secluded island. It turns out to be a farewell party, for they all have been sentenced to die for crimes in their past by a self-appointed judge, jury, and executioner who may be one of them. One by one, the guests are systematically dispatched in the manner described in the lyrics of the children's rhyme \"Ten Little Indians,\" while the survivors nervously eye one another, splintering into tenuous alliances until the next murder throws suspicion on someone new. The terrific cast of character actors has a ball with Dudley Nichols's witty script. The flamboyant sparring of Barry Fitzgerald (whose paternal Irish lilt takes a sinister dimension) and Walter Huston is almost upstaged by Roland Young's deadpan drollery. Romantic leads Louis Hayward and June Duprez come off as arch and stiff in august company that includes a sinisterly detached Judith Anderson, a dotty and distracted  C.&nbsp;Aubrey Smith, and a hilariously flippant Mischa Auer. The story has been  remade numerous times under the title of Christie's novel,Ten Little Indians, but never as well. Clair's effervescent, lively little gem is a fatal drawing-room comedy with a body count and a surreal mood of doom.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEFYO5I", "B000CSTK38", "B001KP2J3U", "B001KP2J3K", "B001KZOVJK", "B001KP2J44", "B000GB5M1A", "B00005RDRO", "B0090XLDO0", "B00AEFXNXW", "B000GB5M1U", "B002Q3MYA8", "B000GB5M1K", "B00GAXASKS", "B000068UE9", "B008RNYMPG", "B00K6D1QV8", "B000199JJI", "B000059LGD", "B00000JGHT", "B00A0HT99G", "B00005Q4D6", "0062073486", "B00008K772", "006226589X", "B004VLYHNA", "B0045HCJHG", "B00E44EZUE", "B00DZP1C9K", "B002MUAXJY", "B00BBI7EZY", "B0002HOEQ2", "B00GAXASLC", "B004HHX9H8", "B00000ILEU", "B00GWXI16O", "B0023Y543Y", "B003YCI238", "B001D8W7EU", "B001V7YZAM", "B007ISJS0U", "B001UWOLQG", "B005X5XI4C", "B001V7YZ9S", "B0085A9IWS", "B000CCW2TS", "B00GWXHYPI", "B00J2CB9BQ", "B004WMOSNM", "B007RKFXTE", "B00008ZZ7B", "B000083C6R", "B005X5XINI", "B006JY3O2M", "B005ETAN7C", "B0087ZG7OI", "B00GWXI0S8", "B00AEBBA7W", "B001V7YZA2", "B00DW5IKWK", "B0028AENVC", "B009TTGKS4", "B0026ZQJP2", "B001SMC9L2", "B0083HXKM2", "B0033PSHB8", "B0045HCJ9E", "B00D7AM2V0", "B000GAKFIG", "B003AND1TG", "B002OQZE6I", "B0006212JK", "6305416222", "B001D8W7EK", "B002945DUM", "B0001ZMWT6", "B001ARDBXK", "B001BSBBGC", "B002GSXKQA", "B00BDSRM4K", "B00000C0QO", "B00EF0NYVI", "B000QGDJG0", "B006Z4LP9K", "B00AQ6J5YA", "B001BSBBDK", "B0047CG95W", "B00CVB6XF2", "B000CRR36K", "B000CC1TNI", "B00871C09S", "B0000797E7", "B001LMAK6A", "B000B8380A", "B009TTGLJM", "B008K1PXIK", "B008BSM1CI", "B000SUHOFG", "B000R1JI32", "B00GHH9I62"], "bought_together": ["B00AEFYO5I", "B001KP2J3U"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AEFYO5I", "B00005RDRO", "B001KZOVJK", "0062073486"]}, "price": 9.95, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 85520}, "asin": "B00000IO3S", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21JR7V6YHQL.jpg", "title": "And Then There Were None"}

{"description": "Academy Award&#xC2;(r) winners* Timothy Hutton (Ordinary People) and Sean Penn (Dead Man Walking) deliver \"superb performances\" (Variety) in a true-story spy thriller that is \"scathing, arresting\" (The New York Times) and laced with white-knuckle excitement. From Oscar&#xC2;(r) winners** John Schlesinger (Midnight Cowboy) and Steven Zaillian (Schindler's List), the film blows the lid off the modern-day American dream with its riveting story of twoyoung men of privilege, money and ambition who end up selling out their country, ruining their families and destroying their lives.

{"description": "With a voracious trio of mako sharks wreaking havoc,Deep Blue  Seadares to up the ante onJaws, but director Renny Harlin trades the nuanced suspense of Spielberg's 1975 blockbuster for the trickery of the digital age. In other words, why build genuine terror when you can show ill-fated humans getting torn into bloody chunks? The aforementioned makos have been lab rats in an effort to harvest a miracle cure for Alzheimer's disease from the brains of sharks, but the research has an unfortunate side effect: the sharks get smarter, and they're determined to break out of Aquatica, the deep-sea complex where they've been penned.Model-actress Saffron Burrows plays the researcher; Thomas Jane pulls double-duty as shark expert and action hunk; Samuel&nbsp;L. Jackson's the corporate sponsor who chooses theworsttime for an Aquatica tour; and rapper LL&nbsp;Cool&nbsp;J is nicely cast as Aquatica's cook and comic  relief. Michael Rapaport, Jacqueline McKenzie, and Stellan Skarsg&aring;rd round out the cast, most of whom are turned into shark food as the makos turn Aquatica into a floating junkyard. Harlin takes devilish pleasure in providing sudden, unexpected shocks--no small feat in such a derivative thriller--and  as a series of action set-pieces,Deep Blue Seanever disappoints. It's inevitable that Burrows should end up in her underwear like Sigourney Weaver inAlien, but even then the movie offers a credible reason for the strip-down; thatDeep Blue Seacan be simultaneously ridiculous and sensible is just another one of its shlocky charms.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B008DL4LQ2", "0767802497", "B00008WFU5", "B0006HBZYC", "B00008WFU4", "B00005A8XX", "6305090564", "B004USUP58", "B003VA3JUO", "B000WTVZGC", "B002NZK5U0", "B00AEFYXQI", "6305943133", "B007STBUHI", "B003ZZ7TPG", "0783225547", "B001YYQ9S8", "B00153ZR8G", "B00AIZ2FPK", "B00005O5B5", "B00064X5L6", "B00064AE0G", "B00AEFYSR2", "B000JBXHQY", "B0002V7OI8", "B00E8G5HQE", "B005CHV14A", "B004FHCHAU", "B00018D3UU", "B00DCLTA6Y", "B000BNX3BE", "B003ABZG14", "B003954IV0", "B00BTYNXJG", "B000NVT0TI", "0767817478", "B000N4RAS8", "B000ASATZ8", "B00000IQC4", "B001DSNEK6", "B00000IQVQ", "B00000G3PA", "B004K4FUVQ", "B00008G8M4", "B002O3Z50G", "0783237413", "B00004STDN", "B004XVMCN0", "B002ZG98LO", "0792839684", "B00005UQ9W", "B000PFU83O", "B0010X73ZG", "B00013RC7K", "B00AEFXPMG", "B004LWZW6K", "B00005JOWW", "B00003L9CQ", "B004AC6PV2", "B0002W4SBI", "B000WTVZGW", "B003UN0752", "B0002IQMAM", "B00005JM5B", "B00BNAE14W", "B00AEFXPSK", "B004P7CN7W", "B000X0GWNG", "B00005RYKU", "B00004Z4WR", "0767824954", "B000BUNZY2", "B00008G8LY", "B00317LM8S", "B00111YM56", "B00003CXKA", "B00600SOXE", "B00005JMXX", "B00AEFY6PQ", "B00005JMZK", "6304806434", "B0045HCJ0S", "B00BTYOYG2", "B000AM4P9K", "B004W7D1G2", "B00AEFYV9W", "B002ZG98KK", "B0001FR3IQ", "B00009WVSL", "B0057RCFQS", "B004EPZ08O", "B00003CXO1", "B000CSUNLG", "B003PIUINS", "B001ECDVKE", "B00111YM5Q", "B00IS6WQ5K", "B0021L8UXA", "B00003CXUP"], "bought_together": ["B00008WFU5", "B00008WFU4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0767802497", "B00008WFU4", "B008DL4LQ2", "B00004TDTO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 122500}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.55, "brand": "JACKSON,SAMUEL L.", "asin": "B00002E233", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71TDBGEC1NL._SY300_.gif", "title": "Deep Blue Sea"}

{"description": "Screwedwas another nail in the coffin of formerSaturday  Night Livewisecracker Norm MacDonald, following his dismal previous film,Dirty Work. However, whileScrewedisn't particularly funny (the  jokes about dentures, dog poop, and dead bodies are pretty much as old as the  hills), the plot exerts a perverse interest; for most of the movie, it's  genuinely unpredictable. MacDonald plays Willard, the butler-chauffer, all-purpose flunky of Mrs. Crock, the wealthy, penny-pinching owner of a pastry  company. Fed up with her abuse, Willard and his friend Rusty (David Chappelle  fromBlue Streakand200 Cigarettes) connive to kidnap her dog  Muffin. But Muffin escapes and returns home; the ransom note is assumed to be  for Willard himself. Rusty and Willard run with the idea, sending in a videotape  of himself being held prisoner. When a detective starts getting a little too  close, they panic and decide to fake Willard's death... Okay, none of it makes  much sense, but in a world of ridiculously formulaic movies that slavishly  follow every screenwriting clich&eacute;,Screwedseems like a brief  oasis of narrative invention. Of course, it still isn't funny. And by the end,  it's lost whatever spark of imagination that got it started. Too bad. It's  written by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski, the screenwriters responsible  forProblem Child, but also forEd WoodandThe People vs.  Larry Flynt--they should stick to biographies.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792842162", "B003NHMYI8", "B004V2S4QK", "B0009PVZ9Q", "B0006HBZE2", "B00000K3U4", "B000H7J9YE", "B000068MBS", "B000M9CB4W", "B0000399WD", "155890834X", "B00006CXI1", "B000095J1K", "B00003CXP4", "B000063RQO", "B00003CXPS", "0783225490", "B0000TWMQ6", "B00004RF89", "B0006HBZEW", "B00AEBB8FQ", "B00018YCIM", "B00005KA6V", "B00AEBBA2C", "B00AG4714S", "B001G5T6GW", "B000FDEV48", "B00AEFY6TW", "B000CNESTE", "B000FZETIE", "B000U1ZV8U", "0783230338", "B00AEBB99Q", "B000P0J09M", "B0006Q93CO", "B000A3XYIM", "B000K405CY", "B00363WGBO", "B00AEBB9AA", "B000PHX5P0", "B000065K4K", "B00005OCJP", "B00004TJMW", "B00008EY9G", "B0016MJ6J2", "B00E56GB12", "B003VPX5Y4", "B00006RCNV", "B00E8G5HZ0", "B000EQ45CE", "B004H4AD2U", "B000BVM1R8", "B00GMV8M2Y", "B00AEBB95K", "B000B5XOWU", "B000EMGJAO", "B0006H32EI", "0767821467", "B000J4P9P8", "B00BTYPWDQ", "B000BBOUCC", "B000069HQ2", "B0009PVZD2", "B0009HKH6Q", "B0001LQJMQ", "B0000VV55I", "B002GIBVVQ", "6305161860", "B00003CXE4", "B00441GYVA", "B00008EY6Q", "B000EGDBZ6", "B001BA9FIG", "B0012E2GFK", "B00LB3OB5A", "B000071ZZJ", "B000BUE5FA", "B000VG66XS", "B000EOMB9U", "B00005UQ9W", "B0000648ZQ", "B001QB9H10", "B0000WN0UU", "B0001Z4OXS", "B00005PJ8T", "0780622561", "B00005JMYI", "B00003CXGA", "B002ZG97B0", "B000AYELVA", "B001AGXEAG"], "bought_together": ["0792842162", "B0009PVZ9Q"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0792842162", "B0009PVZ9Q", "B004V2S4QK", "B0006HBZE2"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 93196}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.96, "brand": "Universal Studios", "asin": "B00003CWQ9", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/2177R08K7CL.jpg", "title": "Screwed"}

{"description": "Men of Honorpresents a great role model for younger viewers, yet it's rated R due to abundant use of theFword. With appropriate discretion, parents should allow their preteen and teenaged children to see this rousing if altogether conventional biopic inspired by the life of Carl Brashear. Played with gravity and gumption by Cuba Gooding Jr., Brashear was the first African American to become a master diver in the U.S. Navy, despite the lingering effects of segregation, opposition from Navy brass, and the amputation of his left leg following a tragic on-duty accident. Robert De Niro adds marquee value and salty bluster as Billy Sunday, the drunken, redneck (and fictionalized) Master Chief who watches, with gradual admiration, as Brashear attains his ultimate goal through sheer force of will.This is all quite uplifting on its surface, but in attempting to hit the requisite highlights of an inspiring biography, director George Tillman Jr. (Soul Food) reduces Brashear's achievement to a succession of clich&eacute;s, forcing Gooding and De Niro to battle sentiment with their noteworthy performances. As Sunday's neglected wife, Charlize Theron is completely extraneous; Hal Holbrook's diving-school commander is a ranting caricature; and newcomer Aunjanue Ellis barely registers as Brashear's wife (in part because their obligatory romance is handled with an utter lack of finesse). There's no question that Brashear's efforts are heroic and worthy of recognition, soMen of Honorserves its basic purpose. Still, one can't help but wonder if Brashear's story would be even more impressive with a more authentic treatment.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000KF0GWW", "B00005B6JZ", "B000F6IODE", "B00005JLRZ", "B00003CXGV", "6304765258", "1558908315", "B0007KIFGE", "B00319ECI8", "B00005JA9F", "B00125WAWS", "B0006L0L5C", "B000P0J0C4", "B000056VP4", "0790736411", "B000065U1N", "B005LAIGN2", "B00AEFYRP0", "B002NZK5VO", "B003ASLJOU", "B0002WZTOI", "B00005JPBO", "0790732238", "6305432317", "B00003CXHJ", "B00005N5S3", "B002VWNICM", "B002AT8K9W", "B002VECM6S", "B00067BCBI", "B00008EY60", "B00000G3PA", "B005LAIGYQ", "B00005JKTP", "B002D755AI", "B000095WW8", "B00AEFY5B6", "B0045HCJHQ", "B00AEFXOKO", "B00AEBB9NM", "B00003CXTG", "B000P0J0EM", "B00008K76U", "B00AEBBA36", "B00005JK8K", "B000KGGIZK", "0800177967", "B00026ZD04", "B000EXZFCQ", "B00003CXFV", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00004XPPG", "B004SIP7ZS", "0792159659", "B000E8QVWY", "B00005PJ8L", "B00AEFYENK", "B00005JLSB", "B00008L3S6", "B000P0J0CE", "B00001ZWUS", "B000P0J09C", "B0006GAOJA", "0451409744", "6304711891", "B00AEFYUQQ", "B00E8G5HZ0", "B002GHHHPQ", "B00441GZ1Y", "B000JYW5BE", "B00005Y1UX", "B001FB55L2", "0790730979", "0783226845", "0783240295", "B00004W221", "0783225733", "B00005JKWX", "B00G4Q3KOC", "B0045HCJ8K", "B00HLTD3ZW", "6305213305", "B00AEFXT1S", "B000SFOW8I", "B000EHSVSC", "B0006IIOHC", "B001QERPAC", "B000P0J0EW", "B004AOECXI", "0780631684", "B00HZMZ2FE", "B00096S49Y", "B0000542CK", "B000066HAS", "B000A2UBN4", "B0043X1FL8", "B00005JNQA", "B000059TFO", "B00003CXTM"], "bought_together": ["B000KF0GWW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00003CXRP", "B005LAIHXQ", "B00DV2MVWO", "B000KF0GWW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 125288}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.99, "brand": "TCFHE", "asin": "B00003CXPP", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516WESMCF3L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Men of Honor"}

{"description": "Hong Kongwuxiafilms, or martial arts fantasies, traditionally squeeze poor acting, slapstick humor, and silly story lines between elaborate fight scenes in which characters can literally fly.Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragonhas no shortage of breathtaking battles, but it also has the dramatic soul of a Greek tragedy and the sweep of an epic romance. This is the work of director Ang Lee, who fell in love with movies while watchingwuxiafilms as a youngster and madeCrouching Tigeras a tribute to the form. To elevate the genre above its B-movie roots and broaden its appeal, Lee did two important things. First, he assembled an all-star lineup of talent, joining the famous Asian actors Chow Yun-fat and Michelle Yeoh with the striking, charismatic newcomer Zhang Ziyi. Behind the scenes, Lee called upon cinematographer Peter Pau (The Killer,The Bride with White Hair) and legendary fight choreographer Yuen Wo-ping, best known outside Asia for his work onThe Matrix. Second, in adapting the story from a Chinese pulp-fiction novel written by Wang Du Lu, Lee focused not on the pursuit of a legendary sword known as \"The Green Destiny,\" but instead on the struggles of his female leads against social obligation. In his hands, the requisite fight scenes become another means of expressing the individual spirits of his characters and their conflicts with society and each other.The filming required an immense effort from all involved. Chow and Yeoh had to learn to speak Mandarin, which Lee insisted on using instead of Cantonese to achieve a more classic, lyrical feel. The astonishing battles between Jen (Zhang) and Yu Shu Lien (Yeoh) on the rooftops and Jen and Li Mu Bai (Chow) atop the branches of bamboo trees required weeks of excruciating wire and harness work (which in turn required meticulous \"digital wire removal\"). But the result is a seamless blend of action, romance, and social commentary in a populist film that, like its young star Zhang, soars with balletic grace and dignity.--Eugene Wei", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0007QS27K"], "also_viewed": ["B0007Q6VXC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 367958}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 0.95, "brand": "", "asin": "B00003CXR3", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51G39T50SDL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]"}

{"description": "Employing shock techniques and sound design in a relentless sensory assault,Requiem for a Dreamis about nothing less than the systematic destruction of hope. Based on the novel by Hubert Selby Jr., and adapted by Selby and director Darren Aronofsky, this is undoubtedly one of the most effective films ever made about the experience of drug addiction (both euphoric and nightmarish), and few would deny that Aronofsky, in following his breakthrough filmPi, has pushed the medium to a disturbing extreme, thrusting conventional narrative into a panic zone of traumatized psyches and bodies pushed to the furthest boundaries of chemical tolerance. It's too easy to call this a cautionary tale; it's a guided tour through hell, with Aronofsky as our bold and ruthless host.The film focuses on a quartet of doomed souls, but it's Ellen Burstyn--in a raw and bravely triumphant performance--who most desperately embodies the downward spiral of drug abuse. As lonely widow Sara Goldfarb, she invests all of her dreams in an absurd self-help TV game show, jolting her bloodstream with diet pills and coffee while her son Harry (Jared Leto) shoots heroin with his best friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) and slumming girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly). They're careening toward madness at varying speeds, and Aronofsky tracks this gloomy process by endlessly repeating the imagery of their deadly routines. Tormented by her dietary regime, Sara even imagines a carnivorous refrigerator in one of the film's most memorable scenes. And yet... does any of this have a point? Is Aronofsky telling us anything that any sane person doesn't already know?Requiem for a Dreamis a noteworthy film, but watching it twice would qualify as masochistic behavior.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0057ZAA6W", "B00005JM23", "6305594333", "B0007CEXYK", "B00005YUPD", "078401213X", "1560252480", "B00H3JHGBC", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00005JMJG", "B000I0QL7I", "B0009A40ES", "B00049QQHI", "B00005ATQB", "B000LAZDPG", "B00003CXZ4", "0792838068", "B0000AC8LR", "0783229526", "6305692572", "B0041KKYEM", "B000QGEB1M", "B00008977H", "B001AR60GK", "B000MGB6NM", "B0045HCJ08", "6305313687", "B001TOD92C", "B00009Y3QI", "B000NO39FG", "B000JBXXYK", "B00008975Z", "6305162026", "B00004UEDQ", "B000068MC2", "B00606OZUY", "B00003CWQR", "B000ERVK4Y", "B000A7DVR2", "B000A9QK6E", "B00EUENWIY", "B0016MJ6T2", "B00005JPAR", "B00008MTXI", "B004SIP95G", "B00AEFXESQ", "B000JMK6LW", "B00004Y6Q5", "B000FVQLQQ", "B000BYA5G4", "B00005JKJA", "B00005JKM2", "B0029LHW68", "B000BBOUUE", "B004FQX5B6", "B000PAAJZ6", "B000N3SU92", "B003YKYX9M", "B00AEBB8O2", "B00007AJF8", "B00A2H9QN8", "B0009WFEDC", "B00GUO2SKA", "B00013RC2K", "B000A7Q2DM", "B00003CXWV", "0792845803", "B001URA5Y8", "B00195I3O0", "B00006AFUR", "B000063JDE", "B00BMKGZVA", "B00AEBB8NI", "B00112S8RS", "B00177YA6U", "0767837398", "B000O76ZQC", "B0052ADP6Y", "B000J10F8C", "B000E6ESU8", "B00009OOFH", "B00005JLRE", "B0059GVBHG", "0767824954", "B00005JLWN", "B00E8G5GU6", "B000QXDCLA", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00004ZETA", "B00AEBB9CS", "B000021Y77", "B00011CZRE", "B002VECM4A", "B00003CXKS", "B006KH6CF4", "B000K7VHQE", "6305127654", "B00AFEXRME", "B004SIP7ZS", "B00020HB32"], "bought_together": ["B0057ZAA6W", "B00005JM23"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005JMJG", "B000MEYKD2", "B0057ZAA6W", "B00005JPAR"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 222264}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 15.36, "brand": "", "asin": "B00003CXP1", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/519CB9K0QML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut"}

BATS is a jolting ride of sight, sound and fear.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005NKC6", "B001221DUG", "B002NZK5U0", "6305943133", "6305090564", "B00L8QOZK6", "B00018D3UU", "B00000IQC4", "B0006HBZYC", "6305258287", "B00JJOY45U", "B004CZZZEK", "B008DL4LQ2", "B001YYQ9S8", "B002K0WBVE", "0767802497", "B002GHHHL0", "B00AIZ2FPK", "B00AEFYXQI", "B0001FGBWU", "B00064X5L6", "B0079K4W9E", "B00005O5B5", "B003ZZ7TPG", "B0000JCFN6", "B00BNAE14W", "B000WTVZGC", "B00JJOY496", "0783225547", "B002I41KNC", "0767818024", "B00EDOS600", "0767817478", "B001DSNEK6", "B000OVLBHG", "B004P7CN3G", "B002NN7EY2", "B00AEFXPSK", "B00441GYZG", "B000BQ7J98", "B001AR0D54", "B00005K3O1", "B004S8UTII", "6305120021", "B003954IV0", "B004K4FUVQ", "B001B8XRT6", "B00003CY6P", "B0002W4SBI", "B00007AJG3", "B0009S4II8", "B00A1AU74I", "B00AEFY6PQ", "B00AEFYV9W", "B00JJOY47I", "B000A2X40G", "B00005N5RM", "B00008WJDW", "B0017DQFB2", "B000JBXHQY", "B0001FVDQ4", "B002ZG98KK", "B004AC6PMG", "B0055SJW10", "B001NFNFFS", "B00IJS2OXG", "B001B3LIM4", "B00111YM5Q", "B00JJOY41E", "B003VA3JUO", "0800177789", "B000FUF6Z4", "6305645515", "B00004STDN", "B004RBC5S8", "B00JHH22O4", "0792841328", "B00C3OX0H6", "B00005RHGK", "B000A7Q1UQ", "B000AM6OQ2", "B00AEFYSR2", "B004LWZW6K", "B0000ALPFL", "B000MM0LIM", "B004I9SJG6", "B00004YS98", "B00008WFU5", "B000MEYKEQ", "B000N4RAS8", "B0007R4TR6", "B000053UIF", "B00005AVZS", "0783222149", "B000CSUNLG", "B000EHSVPK", "B00003CWRF", "B005ETANC2", "0783226934"], "bought_together": ["B002NZK5U0", "B00000IQC4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0974237922", "B00000IQC4", "B004CZZZEK", "B002NZK5U0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 78204}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.39, "brand": "Columbia/Tristar Studios", "asin": "B00003L9CQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZC9X6AMSL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Bats"}

{"description": "Gwen Cummings (Sandra Bullock), a successful N.Y. journalist and ultimate party girl, loves to havea good time! Trouble is, she never can tell when she's had enough. When she borrows her sister's (Elizabeth Perkins) wedding limo and plows it into someone's front porch, the wild life she shares with her boyfriend, Jasper (Dominic West), comes to a screeching halt. She earns herself a DUI and a 28-day stretch in rehab. There, she faces an unthinkable set of rules (no cell phones!) and some strange rituals, like chanting and (gulp!) sharing her feelings. Joining up with an eccentric group of fellow rehabbers led by the inimitable Counselor Cornell (Steve Buscemi), Gwen embarks on a touching and often hilarious road to recovery where she learns that life is not always a party and that real happiness comes from within.", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305692572", "B000ERVK4Y", "6305162026", "B003YKYX9M", "B00008MTXI", "B0045HCJ08", "B000I0QL7I", "B0007CEXYK", "0783235380", "B007VI5AQ8", "B00AFEXRME", "B000JBXXYK", "B002O3Z4ZW", "0792838068", "B0017X1WGK", "B0000549B1", "B000Z3N1HQ", "B00049QQHI", "B003AC98V2", "B00A2H9QN8", "B000J10F8C", "0615763146", "B00EUENWIY", "B000E6ESU8", "B000CEV3M8", "B00000JGHN", "B002UNMWTC", "B000XSKDBA", "B00003CWQR", "B004V4RW8O", "B003JO6OPO", "B00641Y2ZS", "B005FH1RRI", "B00JAGF9HE", "B0052ADP6Y", "6305736685", "B002NZK5V4", "B003PIUIJC", "B00006ZXSQ", "6304765266", "B000LAZDPG", "B00465I16K", "B000G6BLJW", "B00G5N0P9M", "B002NZK5VO", "B002SYAGNC", "B00114XTHA", "B001E95ZNS", "B002NZK5RS", "B00005Q4CS", "B007TSV4GK", "B00009Y3QI", "B000QGDY0G", "B000M341SC", "B000HEWEE4", "B002K0WBXW", "B00008NRI7", "B00068GTK6", "0935908536", "B002NZK5UK", "B0039Y774Q", "B0006IIKRG", "B000021Y7L", "B00AWE09Z0", "0578045427", "B00066FB2A", "6305212112", "B000067IZ3", "0944480039", "B00AWE14PO", "B002VECM6S", "B00005JM23", "0830907394", "0767811100", "B004RD3YFE", "B000FVQLQQ", "B0077ATSSQ", "B00FXWAZW8", "B000UAE7KO", "6305594333", "B00CQMADIO", "B00ECW9WTW", "B00AEFYSWM", "B0006GANOQ", "0393702510", "B0018QOIWG", "B00AEFXT1S", "B00CHEM2GC", "B003B3NGS6", "B002NZK5UU", "B004QL7JYO", "B0045HCJJ4", "B0057ZAA6W", "B000UPMZ30", "B00005JH9M", "1568382820", "0979021804", "B001O5CLXY", "B00006ZXSO", "B00I8Z9LZE"], "bought_together": ["B000ERVK4Y", "6305692572"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000ERVK4Y", "B003YKYX9M", "6305692572", "B003AC98V2"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 4669}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.35, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B00004UEDQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51oiJkNLvuL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "28 Days (Special Edition)"}

{"description": "If you've seenScreamandI Know What You Did Last Summer, then you know the entire plot ofScary Movie. That's okay, though, because this is a parody, and it helps to know the story in order to be able to get the jokes. No, the biggest surprise here is not the  story as much as the amount of full-frontal male nudity. Really, in addition to all the dick jokes (and the ass jokes and fart jokes), there's a couple of shots of the male member, one of which is erect and used as a weapon.Scary Moviesomehow ended up with an R rating, which in a sense is groundbreaking; perhaps our ratings board is loosening up after all.But is it funny? That's the most important question, and the answer to that is yes. In the vein ofAirplane!, with a dash of the Farrelly brothers,Scary Moviekeeps throwing jokes at you one after another. The law of averages says some of them have to hit, and enough of them do to keep the movie entertaining. Unlike the makers ofAirplane!, however, the Wayans brothers aren't making this movie out of a love of the genre, and unlike the Farrelly brothers, they don't make fun of retarded people with any sort of respect, so the humor throughout feels a lot uglier. Still, there are enough funny scenes inScary Movieto make the viewing experience worthwhile. Special credit must go to Lochlyn Munro as Greg, the over-the-top jock, who steals the movie up until the time he's gotta die.--Andy Spletzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004SIP9I8", "B004SIP9KQ", "B000FOQ1KY", "B00CAATSME", "B0009P42WI", "B001J710YI", "B004SIP9O2", "B00AZMFINM", "B004SIP9MY", "B0016MJ6J2", "B004SIP9P6", "B000F9RLL2", "B004LWZW2O", "B005CFBYW6", "B004P7CMZ0", "6305017115", "B005DCJ218", "B0000VCZMK", "B00177YA06", "0780631684", "B000055WFZ", "B00008K7AM", "B002IT5GDC", "B000O76ZOO", "B0002VYOVI", "B00AEFXQLQ", "B000RIWAVW", "B001NPD9LS", "B000069CF0", "B004SIP8ES", "B00441GYVA", "630529142X", "B000FA57UI", "B000AM4P9K", "B009XTF8KQ", "B002A5EBMQ", "0767811070", "B00AEFYPXY", "B00005LC4Q", "B002Q4VBPQ", "B000K405CY", "B000IFRT4W", "B0021L8UXA", "B003Q6D27S", "B000FC2HS6", "B00081912E", "B00003CY5Y", "0783235070", "B00AEFYYH6", "B00H0EN98E", "B004EPZ084", "B000FA57US", "B001P3SA9Y", "B0031U8OEK", "B00003CXPS", "B003PIUINS", "B000VKL6Z2", "B001L9EXUC", "B000WZEZGI", "B003UESJBU", "B005DEUEXQ", "B00003CXS7", "B00009PY4G", "B00BEIYGT8", "B002GHHHG0", "B006W4KVH0", "B000GBEWHK", "B00AJLHUA8", "B002ZG971U", "B000WGYMTC", "B00J5JSV3A", "B00005K3NR", "B000J4QW7W", "B001J9KJ4I", "B00003CXZ1", "B004EPZ06G", "B000V4UFZK", "B0006SSOHC", "B00001QGUM", "B000022TSW", "B00AEFYE08", "0767824954", "B000031WD9", "B00004STUL", "B00005JNZU", "B004SEUJO6", "B008R65XTC", "B00BEIYMAG", "B00AQJ8MLY", "B00AEFY37C", "B002ZG97TW", "B00005N7Z1", "B004P7CN7W", "B00003CY6D", "B00E8RKHWW", "B00BEIYMZ6", "B008G33PIM", "B000P0J09M", "B00006FDCD", "B00AEFYQWO"], "bought_together": ["B004SIP9I8", "B004SIP9KQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000FOQ1KY", "B004SIP9KQ", "B004SIP9I8", "B008MXMFVE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 150447}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.99, "brand": "Dimension", "asin": "B00004Z4WQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5123WET5P4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Scary Movie"}
{"description": "Nathalie Baye and Sergi L&oacute;pez are lonely lovers who meet through an ad in a singles magazine for anonymous sex and fall in love. Frederic Fonteyne's tender portrait of a brief affair is framed in flashback: the two lovers recall their relationship for an unseen interviewer (a technique that recalls Ingmar Bergman'sHour of the Wolfand Woody Allen'sHusbands and Wives), putting on a tough, scarred front that hides their regret. In the flashbacks, however, Fonteyne captures a sense of discomfort and anticipation in their first meeting that turns relaxed and passionate as their relationship deepens. Baye's nervous smiles become genuine and joyful as she grows more confident in L&oacute;pez's company, and he nicely straddles the line between nonchalant openness and emotional defensiveness. Fonteyne's naturalistic style is broken only for the almost surreal vision of the hotel where they meet: they pass through a hellish crimson hall before entering their room, a cool blue sanctuary--a heaven on the other side of purgatory. It was released under a different name in France, an ironic title that translates toA Pornographic Affair, but the film is a sensitive, delicate portrait of fragile souls who allow self-doubts and second guesses get in the way of their own honesty.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00070Q82M", "B004EI2NPE", "B000TXPXAU", "B0079K4WEE", "B0010SAGHS", "B00023P4I8", "B0019UGYAU", "B0001I2CHK", "B00005JMIJ", "B00GPPXNIK", "B0002JZT5A", "B00008G8MG", "B00006SFJT", "B0004Z32NI", "B00AYGVCCK", "B00FXWAZW8", "B0007TZHWA", "076782170X", "B004YCKKH8", "B000VLCRCW", "B0037QGS0A", "B001CIOCLC", "B000BGH29K", "B002VKB0M4", "B00007J5VT", "B00APUAKYG", "B001AIQ14A", "B000FWHW68", "B0015FHDWM", "B0009GX1XI", "B00005NTN4", "B001CRC4DG", "B00DJYJNWK", "B002JCYSL4", "B0069UV0AY", "B00B022GVS", "B003L20INS", "B00005JPX8", "B00000F4MA", "B00CFK5J9U", "B003XKNGNW", "B000UVV26A", "B00F8PTALC", "B009T3AGVW", "B00AKLLSNC", "B000CBG5PG", "B0019K4YT8", "B00EMAGKNU", "B00007KQ9W", "B002AS463W", "B004GBMVTW", "B005DU58QS", "B003ODKZTQ", "B00000JLTR", "B003VA3JTA", "B00A7WHL08", "0783230559", "B0000C9JFO", "B004MCGNV2", "B00827OWO8", "B000W44IZW", "1573623849", "B003EYVXQO", "B005Z9MGRG", "B001AZKB8K", "B0076ANKUY", "B00B0LKUKI", "B000GI3KGC", "B00008972P", "B00CBFB8SU", "B00005V4XV", "B000NJWIPI", "B00EO2I6QK", "B004Y2SDX6", "B00005B1WH", "B000TGURZ8", "6305132917", "B000085OY1", "B00AZNEVJ8", "B00003CXXY", "B000PKG8TM", "B000HC2LHG", "B001139ZH4", "0847841499", "B00H206P0K", "B000059H7D", "B007JYVJ14", "B0002PYRZC", "B0027820I8"], "bought_together": ["B00070Q82M"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AKLLSNC", "B003LV3BJC", "B000EZ9084", "B000F0UUD2"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 48144}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.0, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B000055YV3", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51WKEGW1ZEL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "An Affair of Love"}

{"description": "AlthoughSunshinewas made by a Hungarian, Istv&aacute;n Szab&oacute;, and deals with the history of Hungary as refracted through three generations of a Jewish-Hungarian family, you might be more inclined to give it three hours of your own life if you approach it as a David Lean movie in spirit. Itisan English-language picture, and Maurice Jarre's music recalls his score forDoctor Zhivago. Szab&oacute; emulates Lean's intimate-epic style of merging the sweep of history with the crystalline detailing of individual lives, so that the shape of destiny is glimpsed through personal moments that feel at once evanescent and eternal. His lighting cameraman, Lajos Koltai, is one of the handful of cinematographers equal to capturing these moments in lapidary images--cinematic sunshine of the highest order.\"Sunshine\" is a literal translation of Sonnenschein, the family name of the central characters. And \"destiny\" is one meaning of Sors, the name three Sonnenschein offspring choose for themselves to better assimilate as subjects of the Austro-Hungarian empire. Two are brothers, Ignatz (Ralph Fiennes) and Gustave (James Frain); their sister (by adoption) Valerie (Jennifer Ehle) is really their cousin. Both men love her, and Ignatz rocks the ultratraditional family by taking her as his wife. Nevertheless, the Sonnenscheins and the Sors enter upon the 20th century in loving solidarity, grateful to live under a liberal and tolerant regime. That's all swept away by the Great War, the rise of Nazism, and its replacement, the new fascism of Stalinist Communism. Valerie survives them all--though she's played later on by Rosemary Harris, Ehle's own mother. For his part--or parts--Ralph Fiennes goes on to embody two later generations of Sonnenschein/Sors men, the proudly patriotic Adam and his son, the rudderless Ivan, whose guilt over being a compliant prisoner at Auschwitz leads him to buy into the passionate puritanism of the Stalinist purges. Fiennes rises to the awesome challenge of creating three utterly distinct characters who all share the same congenital weaknesses and aching potential for greatness.This is a film of considerable beauty and sometimes shattering power. Even three hours is not enough to do justice to all the characters, all the wrenching turnarounds of history and political allegiance and rectitude. But the film is never less than gripping, and as an essay on \"family values,\" it's well-nigh definitive.--Richard T.

{"description": "Heavy on atmosphere and light on everything else,From Hellis visually impressive while lacking the depth of the acclaimed graphic novel it's based upon. Making their third feature since 1993'sMenace II Society, twins Allen and Albert Hughes approach the Jack the Ripper case with physical precision, re-creating the gritty Whitechapel district of 1888 London in meticulous detail. What they've forgotten is the sheer terror that gripped Whitechapel in the wake of the Ripper's slaying of five prostitutes, investigated here by a Scotland Yard sleuth (Johnny Depp) who uses opium, laudanum, and absinthe to fuel his semiprescient visions of the slayings. Heather Graham attempts a slippery Cockney accent as a would-be victim, while Ian Holm steals the show as a has-been surgeon with devilish delusions of grandeur. Violence is obliquely suggested or briefly graphic, but no matter how you cut it,From Hellis only marginally thrilling as it treads familiar territory.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEBBA72", "B000NQRR1Q", "B004P7CNC2", "B00005R87R", "B000F7CECK", "B00AEBBAEK", "B00000IRE6", "B002QEHPQU", "B0002234LS", "B008QE9XD2", "B0000VD04M", "B0009UZG0K", "0780621611", "B006ISJQ1W", "B004SIP7PS", "B0000AC8LI", "B00347AIOE", "B00003CXWV", "B003HKN52U", "B001HN69AY", "B000053VAZ", "B000TGJ80S", "B0012Q7M02", "B00AEBB9F0", "B002Q3MYA8", "B00C888MJ8", "B00004XPPB", "B000FDEV3Y", "0780628551", "0783229526", "B001HN694K", "B0000WN140", "B0009IOR6Q", "B00F84H73Q", "B00003CXRG", "B001GCUO0W", "B004A8ZWSS", "B004SIP6BI", "B00004W4UB", "B000N2HDJQ", "B000C3L27U", "B000GCFO0I", "B000BB1MI2", "B005S9EJ8W", "B0009XRZKQ", "B00AEBB89W", "B008R65Y28", "B001I04QCO", "B00008LUNW", "B00005JLKN", "B003Y5H54W", "B0012QE4Q2", "B00DZP1C2W", "B00AEBB8NI", "B00JPFTX5O", "B0000TPA0G", "B001AGXEAG", "B0041KKYEM", "B00J5JSV3A", "B000069I1I", "B002UOMH00", "B004SIP92O", "B001A50716", "B005LAIHYU", "B0002KVUKM", "B005COPWZW", "B0036BDQ7Y", "B000UJ48P4", "B004SIP7TE", "B0031U8OEK", "0783116934", "B005LAIHXQ", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B000063US5", "B00005JLQN", "B00DHD933W", "B002AF4Y9G", "B000LP6KNU", "B008JFUNYG", "B0021L8V34", "B001D2WU9I", "B007XF0W3K", "B003AWRMBU", "B00009MEKN", "B00HRCATDW", "B0020PFYHC", "B00003CXKM", "B004SUDQ4A", "B0010DR4BO", "B0097C046W", "B00IKM5LXG", "B000FAOC2W", "B004SIP9Z6", "B00K6D1RVW", "B002ZG97CO", "B00151QYXU", "B005LAIH2C", "6301971345", "6304712499", "B003H5WF3U"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AEBBA72", "B004P7CNC2", "B00005R87R", "B000NQRR1Q"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 164982}, "asin": "B00005JKJM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/418JG1F78JL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "From Hell (Two-Disc Special Edition)"}

{"description": "WithThe Return of the King, the greatest fantasy epic in film history draws to a grand and glorious conclusion. Director Peter Jackson's awe-inspiring adaptation of the Tolkien classicThe Lord of the Ringscould never fully satisfy those who remain exclusively loyal to Tolkien's expansive literature, but as a showcase for physical and technical craftsmanship it is unsurpassed in pure scale and ambition, setting milestone after cinematic milestone as the brave yet charmingly innocent Hobbit Frodo (Elijah Wood) continues his mission to Mordor, where he is destined to destroy the soul-corrupting One Ring of Power in the molten lava of Mount Doom. While the heir to the kingdom of Men, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), endures the massive battle at Minas Tirith with the allegiance of the elf Legolas (Orlando Bloom), dwarf Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) and the great wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen), Frodo and stalwart companion Samwise Gamgee (Sean Astin) must survive the schizoid deceptions of Gollum, who remains utterly convincing as a hybrid of performance (by Andy Serkis) and subtly nuanced computer animation.Jackson and cowriters Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens have much ground to cover; that they do so with intense pacing and epic sweep is impressive enough, but by investing greater depth and consequence in the actions of fellow Hobbits Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd), they ensure thatReturn of the Kingmaintains the trilogy's emphasis on intimate fellowship. While several major characters appear only briefly, and one (Christopher Lee's evil wizard, Saruman) relegated entirely to the extended version on DVD, Jackson is to be commended for his editorial acumen; like Legolas the archer, his aim as a filmmaker is consistently true, and he remains faithful to Tolkien's overall vision. IfReturnsuffers from too many endings, as some critic suggested, it's only because the epic's conclusion is so loyally inclusive of the actors--most notably Astin--who gave it such strength to begin with. By ending theLOTRtrilogy with noble integrity and faith in the power of imaginative storytelling,The Return of the King, like its predecessors, will stand as an adventure for the ages.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JKZV", "B00003CWT6", "B00BEZTMFY", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B002ZG980U", "B002PMV9FG", "B008UZA8FY", "B001NGML48", "B00005JM5E", "B001GZ6QC4", "B005COPWZW", "B008M4C1EO", "B00HFFE8HE", "039548930X", "B000W7F5SS", "B000I0RQVI", "B002VWNIDG", "B000E6EK2Y", "B001BYMX4A", "B004M1A21K", "B007K3JFUQ", "B001DHXT20", "B001UV4XHY", "0345325818", "B003Y5H54W", "B00005JNJV", "B00E5I2M6I", "B000A3XY5A", "B004LWZWGA", "B000U7WV1Y", "B005LXQLRW", "B001OQCV6A", "B000E8M0VA", "B004SIP8ZM", "B000EHRVMY", "0618640150", "B003ZK99NQ", "B0013FDM7E", "B00005JPH2", "B000UNYK4E", "B009JBWOU0", "B00003CX5P", "B00008G8M5", "B00GKOJ98E", "B004LWZW42", "B000H30B2C", "B000P0J0C4", "B00CZDLGDU", "B000M341QE", "B00008G8M4", "B000FKO5QK", "B00HWWUQYY", "B007SPPANM", "B008JFUO72", "B001DJLD1M", "0345538374", "B00AEFY5B6", "B00005JKCH", "B004SIP9U6", "B000YGGNMO", "B00E5I2M9K", "0618126988", "B005OCFGTO", "B00E8S2JZ4", "6305313687", "B004AKCME8", "B0002KVUKM", "B000AARKOO", "B0006GAO5Y", "B000K7VHQ4", "B002ZG997C", "B00AHTYI5M", "B008JFUS0U", "B0042MEQVG", "B00275EGWY", "B00E9PMML2", "B008UZDXEW", "B004SIP7F8", "B00116GEJS", "B00003CXI1", "B003ZKBELG", "B003Y5H5EW", "B000V4UFZK", "B0007PLLBU", "B001DTPZNY", "B002O3Z50Q", "B001GCUO1Q", "B000LP6KNU", "B005G4TJUC", "B00AW0KHTM", "B002ZG97YM", "054792819X", "B00AEFXZJE", "B0000YEEGM", "B002IPFWTE", "B001ECQ75A", "B000065U1N", "B0051MKNV8", "B000W796OM", "B00J49R1BY"], "bought_together": ["B00005JKZV", "B00003CWT6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00HFFE8HE", "B00003CWT6", "B00005JKZV", "B00BEZTMFY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 1589}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.49, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00005JKZY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HS7iSFv5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)"}

{"description": "The venerable Superman mythos gets a 21st-century updating in this imaginative and engaging television series from the WB Network, and series fans can celebrate the ratings success ofSmallvillewith a six-disc set that compiles its entire first season. The deluxe package offers a chance to revisit the origins of the characters and their numerous plotlines, as well as view deleted scenes and other bonus features.The premise ofSmallville--Superman as a teenager--takes up just a few pages in Superman's very first comic book appearance (inAction Comicsback in 1938), but series producers Alfred Gough and Miles Millar flesh out that period by portraying young Clark Kent (Tom Welling) not as the noble Superman-in-waiting, but as an average teen with some not-so-ordinary supernatural powers, including incredible strength and heat vision (Clark hasn't lifted up, up, and away as of yet). Clark's desire to fit in with his peers and make sense of his extraordinary abilities ground him in very realistic and identifiable terms for the series' primarily under-25 audience, as does his appealing and tentative romance with Kristen Kreuk as Clark's dreamgirl Lana Lang. ButSmallvillealso strikes gold when it takes a turn towards more comic book territory, as evidenced by the parade of shape-shifting killers and other outlandish antagonists (many generated, in one of the series' most ingenious notions, by the same devastating meteor shower that brought the infant Clark to Earth) that Clark must harness his powers to face and defeat. Gough and Millar, along with their capable cast (which includes Michael Rosenbaum as a young and already bald-pated Lex Luthor, and Annette O'Toole and John Schneider as the Kents) manage to pull off the precarious high-wire act of combining science fiction with coming-of-age drama to create this highly watchable program.Smallville: The Complete First Seasonoffers a very complete and attractive DVD package that is rounded out by some highly desirable extras for longtime series fans. The six-disc set offers all 21 episodes of the first season, including the pilot, in widescreen anamorphic format; Gough and Millar are featured on the set's sole commentary track, which appears on the pilot episode. Viewers can also access a number of deleted scenes from various episodes as well as view original pre-production storyboards and WB promotional spots. An interactive \"tour\" of Smallville rounds out the extras, but DVD-ROM owners can use the discs to access more features via theSmallvilleweb site.--Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0001JXPPC", "B0002Y0QV2", "B0009A5MUO", "B000G1R4SO", "B000N6SE4U", "B000X5SMXY", "B001FB4VZS", "B002JVWRDQ", "B003L77GG0", "B002JVWRE0", "B0012U7IWU", "B000R206FK", "B003L77GGA", "B001FB4W02", "B00080ZG2O", "B000BT96EG", "B004XWLN20", "B00BBXSPES", "B00BBXSPCK", "B000EHSVLE", "1419826670", "B000EHSVLY", "B000FP2OPY", "B00BGI086Q", "B000R204DY", "B000EU1Q2M", "B001ILFUB4", "B0072BNKHA", "B002JVWRAO", "B000NOKFGW", "B000R7GKQE", "B000FDDYPA", "B000EHSVM8", "B00F4FFO8E", "B000JLTRIG", "B000CCBCGM", "B009LDCXNY", "B000X5SPBI", "B001MVWRNE", "1401238246", "B00CN009Y2", "B00260HH30", "B00DYEN6XC", "B000P6XQ50", "B00DX88IL4", "B0013K2ZFY", "B0006IUE16", "B008JFUPFI", "B000EHSVL4", "B000HT3P60", "B009LDCWWG", "B0015RRNMA", "B00077BPA0", "B000HT3P7E", "B000SMNL92", "B000PFSYO4", "B002LWJ510", "B000P6YNTI", "B001FB4W0C", "B00079FUI6", "B003FSTN5M", "B005SH63HO", "B00AKK6MD4", "1563891182", "B00005JLIC", "B00G7QPX6C", "B009OAWMK8", "B002JVWR4A", "B0053O8AKU", "B005YU8WO2", "B00634MLIQ", "B004EPZ07K", "B000CCBC9O", "B001992NWO", "B000BT96FA", "B0087ZG7NO", "B008JFUS0U", "B000GG4Y6O", "B000PMFRTC", "B0018CWEUI", "1401246370", "B00005JNJV", "B000HEZEY6", "B004YPED14", "B00AZMFJYA", "B000RO6JYK", "B000BOH986", "B000F8O2P6", "B004FM2EQC", "B000HCO83Q", "B002BFBB0A", "B001L1S1OY", "B0000AGQ2H", "B000I0QLQY", "B00005JM3A", "B0006Z2KZ2", "B008X6N8KW", "B00915G6TE", "B00EIL7E9C", "B001G0MFIS"], "bought_together": ["B0001JXPPC", "B0002Y0QV2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B006CR2ON6", "B004XWLN20", "B0001JXPPC", "B000G1R4SO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 7871}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 19.75, "brand": "Warner Brothers", "asin": "B00005JLKB", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51hmhycPIYL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Smallville: Season 1"}

{"description": "It's not that the folks at Pixar are geniuses when it comes to DVDs... well, come to think of it, their fifth DVD set shows these folks are wizards. It's not just that the two discs are packed with watchable extras that hardly reiterate the same information; it's how they are handled--funny, inventive, with a light touch--unlike many PR-driven discs. A good place to start is the filmmakers' jolly commentary track, which branches off into 31 minutes of behind-the-scene stuff, deleted scenes, and curious anecdotes (they can also be watched separately). Pixar's first making-of documentary is a most concise and interesting 25-minute examination that also sheds light on how the company works. With a digital-to-digital transfer, the film looks great and is available in widescreen or reformatted to full screen. The \"Family Fun\" disc includes another Pixar made-for-the-DVD gem, the 7-minute \"Exploring the Reef\" with Jean-Michel Cousteau (Jacques's son) being upstaged by Dori and Marlin; it's a hoot and teaches a fact or two you will remember about reefs. Both discs feature lovely menus that can be turned into virtual aquariums for your TV (by removing the text) featuring the knockout colors of the film's settings. Watch long enough for some shenanigans from the film's characters and vocal talent. Genius, pure genius.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00EV1YZ96", "B00AFEX83C", "B00007LVCM", "B00005JNS0", "B0030IIZ4M", "B00GDT5T9Y", "B003ZHVJGO", "B00G5G7EXY", "B00003CXB4", "B001KVZ6FW", "B0013FSL3E", "B004HO6I4M", "B00005JN4W", "B000MV9026", "B004G600A4", "B000AY74OG", "B000VBJEEG", "B0006UEVT0", "B008YWY0HK", "B003H9M1Q2", "B00CQRN3QI", "B0001I561E", "B0042U94UQ", "B00E9ZATJO", "B000YERP2S", "B0006JMLRK", "B000AAF1TU", "B0000AOX0O", "B00CTNYLQA", "B00F522C7C", "B0039N74CW", "B00003CXCQ", "B001ILFUDC", "B00275EHJG", "B001HN6922", "0736429220", "B000B8QG4A", "B000RMJ4F8", "B0084IHVN4", "B002ZG97YM", "B001ECQ75A", "B004ZBACOE", "B0030IIYYS", "B0084IHVGG", "B00E9ZATKI", "B00AO686JC", "B000GUJZ00", "B00004R99S", "B0012EM5D8", "B0084IHVUC", "B0013ND30M", "B0034JKZ86", "B0000VV4W2", "B00003CX8Y", "B008JFUQ16", "B001DPHDCY", "B00005TN8K", "B00CUDD0C0", "B00A83075M", "B001O5LVPI", "B001NCDFTW", "B00G7TIKMI", "B0000E32WJ", "B00CWM58WY", "B001ILFUD2", "B00009YXAW", "B00CMY3JBO", "B00335EQ0E", "B005LAIISA", "0783231474", "B0002YLCOM", "B00E00OGE2", "B000H7JCK0", "B000UVKGPI", "B00005JMQZ", "B00JK531ES", "B00004U9WQ", "B005LAIH4A", "B005LAIHW2", "B00024I2Z4", "B00I6JOD2S", "B008NNY9QW", "B0000VCZKM", "B00FE8BVF6", "6302526574", "B004EPZ034", "B000L22SG6", "B001OMU6UM", "B00E56D8FO", "B0000524D0", "B002WJI2QQ", "B0009CTT6U", "B000050MN3", "B000B8QG3G", "B0058AFS0O", "B00006FDAI", "B00EGIAQ1K", "B000A7G4TY"], "bought_together": ["B00EV1YZ96", "B00G5G7EXY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00EV1YZ96", "B00AFEX83C", "B00I6JOD2S", "B004HO6I4M"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 7746}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 25.5, "brand": "Disney", "asin": "B00005JM02", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51-difUGanL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)"}

{"description": "Disney changes how they have been delivering their recent theatrical hits and improves the DVD experience. Gone is the creators' commentary track; instead there's a robust 45-minute feature on the making of the film that opens up the audience to older kids interested in the craft. The commentary track is for laughs with the MacKenzie Brothers-influenced moose Rutt & Tuke (SCTValumnus Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas) having a good old time; it's a treat for adults as kids. Also, the traditional still gallery has been replaced by a deft 10-minute display of the various artwork, narrated by the artists. All the deleted scenes are voiced and in various forms of animation; additionally there is a Phil Collins song that was not used in the film. Disney reaches into Pixar's bag of tricks with \"outtakes\" that kids will love, along with the two above-average set-top games.

It would spoil the film's clever design to reveal what happens halfway throughHe Loves Me, He Loves Me Not, so let's just say that Tautou plays a winsome girl in the sunny town of Bordeaux, whose relationship with a married doctor has more layers than first it seems. Samuel LeBihan, fromBrotherhood of the Wolf, plays the doctor, but it's the casting of cutie-pie Tautou that sets up the movie's gradually sinister undertow. Director Laetitia Colombani's inventive structure plays a satisfyingly tricky game with the audience, and may have some viewers going back to the beginning to make sure they saw what they thought they saw. Just don't go in expectingAm&#xE9;liepart deux, and you should find this an ingenious little number.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001CIOCLC", "B008H1Q3QY", "B004YCKKH8", "B0007Z0NYQ", "B0000C9JFO", "B000063K0U", "B002LE8MGW", "B004SEUIXS", "B005V4X8PO", "B001THZAAI", "B0069UV0AY", "B00421IR5I", "B000UVV26A", "B000SSQ7JC", "B002AG2NTI", "B00EMAGJ68", "B000811672", "B000LW7L2M", "B007I1Q59E", "B0002S64SM", "B000GBEWP2", "B0087IT8FK", "B0001I54QQ", "B00005JPX8", "B002VKB0M4", "B000HIVIQU", "B0009P7EI2", "B001AZJKKK", "B0000A1HQP", "B004ZG5EYC", "B00007J5VT", "B004B3254Q", "B000YPUFBA", "B000B58DHQ", "B0000714E9", "B0045NXMJE", "B00000K3TS", "B009CSVQ8Q", "B000934FC2", "B00005B1WH", "B00A92MEJY", "B000UAE7MM", "B00005OSLQ", "B002YBPR4C", "B000CSUNRU", "B001CITQWC", "B004NWPY3E", "B001JV5BA8", "B000296E7W", "B0084O26SI", "B0080QOL6A", "B0019UGYAU", "B001APM44O", "B00AZNEVNE", "B0007IO6GO", "B009TT0BSE", "B000I6BJ56", "B00005N89H", "B000N3T0DW", "B000083C5F", "B004SIP6BI", "B0007A61K6", "B004ZBFRRG", "B00EV1YZKK", "B000FWHW68", "B00AIBZLHS", "B000069I02", "B00GX7WUD4", "B00003CXLD", "B001M72J68", "B00005JKG1", "B0002V7TI8", "B00008ZZ9E", "B00ATK02FO", "B004UXUUDA", "B00009V2IP", "B00D6I7FLA", "B0009XRZKQ", "B002M2T1V8", "B005E7SEK2", "B003Y7D7BU", "B0030BKNIK", "B000021Y77", "B000GH3CQG", "B003U4H0CE", "B00008976Y", "B002VECLXC", "B000YDMPAQ", "B00005NC66", "B00AZNEVJ8", "B00005JNCZ", "0780021541", "B002Z9HBPQ", "0078607183", "B000EBD9SU", "B005HK13S6", "B00005UQA2", "B0000YEENU", "B008EWNP1M"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001CIOCLC", "B002LE8MGW", "B008H1Q3QY", "B004SEUIXS"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 70994}, "asin": "B00005JM48", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51UZ-uQV4fL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "He Loves Me, He Loves Me Not"}
{"description": "Like any DVD blockbuster from producer Jerry Bruckheimer, the extras are plentiful and often a bit too self-congratulatory (worst offender here is the primary commentary track). The slickly (natch) produced making-of documentary goes through the standard routine; however, the less-flashy \"fly on the wall\" bits--just showing what happens on set without comment--is more fun, offering effortless insight on the filmmaking process. The best treasure is a nifty interactive history on pirates with plenty of background material. You can simply play the filmed segments or take a tour around a ship to discover the material (and a few surprises). There's a lot of archival material on the theme-park ride that inspired the film and several odds and ends including an enjoyable chronicle of the vintage ship's voyage from its home harbor to the movie set. The kids should really dig the DVD-ROM \"Moonlight Becomes Ye,\" in which they can turn their own mug into a ghostly pirate. There's also a bounty of extended and deleted scenes (19 in all) and a very funny blooper reel. With both DTS and Dolby 5.1, sound systems will get a workout with the excellent (and loud) sound design.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000I0RQVI", "B000U7WV1Y", "B005COPWZW", "B004A8ZWUQ", "B00005JN5E", "B0013BM63O", "B006VRRGNK", "B00005JKZV", "B00005JPH2", "B0014Z4OMU", "B00E5I2MCM", "B00003CWT6", "B004DTLK80", "B00005JKZY", "B0000A1RJI", "B004M1A21K", "B004DTLK7G", "B00003CXZ1", "B001HN694K", "B001E75QH0", "B00E5I2M6I", "B00005JKCH", "B0087ZG7HK", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B000E6EK2Y", "B000E8M0VA", "B003UYUQZW", "B00AEFYGBA", "B000W746GK", "B00005JMQW", "B0083SBMBM", "B001DHXT20", "B0002234LS", "B000W7F5SS", "B002PMV9FG", "B0002KVUKM", "B004EPYZUS", "B0053FANRC", "B00BEZTMFY", "6304806434", "B000VR0570", "0783231644", "B001OQCV6A", "B000AYELVA", "B008JFUO72", "B005G4TJUC", "B00004R99S", "B00023B1LC", "B00E5I2M9K", "B00003CXI1", "B001HQZJMU", "B00000IRE6", "B0002ZDVEU", "B008QE9XD2", "B00F84H73Q", "B00E5I2MEK", "B003Y5H5EW", "B007K3JFUQ", "B003QO8TOQ", "B000NQRR1Q", "B000YPUF9W", "B001EZE5BU", "B004A8ZWSS", "B0009MDPYM", "B00LG6YEKE", "B002ZG980U", "B002ZG994U", "B000U1ZV8K", "B001DZ8TRW", "B00005JLR2", "B000VWYJ86", "B00AZMFJYA", "B001GZ6QC4", "B00000JQB5", "B004XKCZAG", "B000W796OM", "B001GCUO0W", "B00AQSN7HE", "B00000ILDH", "B0053FANT0", "B0000VAFO0", "B0002IQMAM", "B000HRMAPE", "B004LWZW7Y", "B008UZA8FY", "B0001HLVS2", "B00007AJGH", "B00005JNJV", "B003YAR97K", "B00CHVJODE", "B000UR9T8C", "B0049IHX2C", "B000G6BLW4", "B00177YA1K", "0783227345", "B0014Z4ON4", "B001TK80C0", "B002O5M4T4", "B00AEBBA72", "B00005JOC9"], "bought_together": ["B000I0RQVI", "B000U7WV1Y"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005COPWZW", "B000I0RQVI", "B0071JADFU", "B00005JPFX"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 6260}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.23, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B00005JM5E", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51fX40gGdXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)"}
{"description": "The seemingly obligatory director's commentary is not on this two-disc set of Michael Mann's slick thriller yet the extras are so good you won't miss it. On the surface, there's nothing out of the ordinary here with the exception of a few minutes of rehearsal footage, but everything is just so darn interesting to watch. Mann and his stars dish about the making of the film, including the creation of Cruise's assassin. The nighttime shooting (shot digitally and transferred sublimely) is examined along with a single deleted scene (with a clear explanation on why it was cut). Think the climatic finale aboard a train was shot on a subway for convenience? No, Mann just wanted to control the backgrounds!

{"description": "There's a pretty good gimmick with these DVD extras aimed squarely at the pre-teen/early teen audience that ate up this film. Each of the extras (a standard making-of featurette, an alternate ending, and an interesting deleted scene) is followed by a clue afterwards. Decipher the clues and unlock the next set of extras: a nice bit on real treasure hunters, an awful piece on the Knights Templar, and one gem for kids: \"Riley Poole's Decode this!\" Actor Justin Bartha reprises his role (Nic Cage's techno-sidekick) and lectures a bit on the cooler side of language history and code-breaking with a few simple interactive games. If you get through it all, you unlock a hidden feature, a trivia track. Thankfully, those who do not want to go on the treasure hunt can access these features by reading the printed insert. Also thankfully, director Jon Turteltaub's enthusiasm always makes DVD extras more watchable than most.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0013BM63O", "B002GJTYIW", "B000NOKJC2", "B00979KQFO", "B00005JOC9", "B002O5M4T4", "B002ZG99KO", "B00005JM5E", "B00004Z4WR", "B001DTPZNY", "B005COPWZW", "B00008G8M4", "B000TGJ8CQ", "B000I0RQVI", "B001E75QH0", "B00AEFZ2DG", "B000OVLBF8", "B00003CXC5", "B0009NSCRQ", "B000ASATYY", "076780676X", "B00AEFYGBA", "B000U7WV1Y", "B00000G3PA", "B0067EKYAY", "0767810856", "B002O3Z50G", "B000YGGNMO", "B0012KJ0DK", "B000AYELVA", "B000JLTRIQ", "B000E8M0VA", "B001OQCV6A", "B000A0GP0Y", "B0009DWL8W", "B000VWYJ86", "B000IJ7A24", "B005LAII1W", "B001L57ZYM", "B0002ZDVEU", "B001TODCII", "B0049GYXH2", "B00000JQB5", "6305433909", "B000UNYK4E", "B0016Q2D5M", "B00177Y9ZC", "B001GCUO02", "B00003CXZ1", "B00014NEZI", "B007K3JFUQ", "B00003CXA6", "B0034GK78W", "B00344EAN2", "B001MVYUQG", "B000FO0AA6", "B004M1A21K", "B00003CXC3", "B0012QCZ54", "B00E8G5HQE", "B00E5I2MCM", "B00009XUM5", "B001DHXT20", "B00005JMXX", "B000J3OTT6", "B001FB55MG", "B000031EGV", "B001HQZJMU", "B0014Z4OMU", "B004SIP8JI", "B005LAIIPS", "B001F7MSFM", "B00005JMOW", "B001GZ6QC4", "B003Q6D2B4", "B00003CXMP", "B005F2JRUC", "B00AEFXSLE", "B004EPYZUS", "B000J3OTSM", "6305213283", "B00028HBES", "B000FO0A9W", "B008JFUNTG", "B0007KIFGE", "B002GSXKP6", "B001GCUO1Q", "B00008G8LM", "B00005JN3W", "B00AEFXXMI", "B0087ZG7NO", "B002ZG99TK", "B00AEFYXJ0"], "bought_together": ["B0013BM63O", "B002ZG99KO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0013BM63O", "B000NOKJC2", "B00BQRY4C6", "B002GJTYIW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 1940}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.75, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B00005JN5E", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51S18NKZHRL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "National Treasure (Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "Jamie Foxx's uncannily accurate performance isn't the only good thing aboutRay. Riding high on a wave of Oscar buzz, Foxx proved himself worthy of all the hype by portraying blind R&B; legend Ray Charles in a warts-and-all performance that Charles approved shortly before his death in June 2004. Despite a few dramatic embellishments of actual incidents (such as the suggestion that the accidental drowning of Charles's younger brother caused all the inner demons that Charles would battle into adulthood), the film does a remarkable job of summarizing Charles's strengths as a musical innovator and his weaknesses as a philandering heroin addict who recorded some of his best songs while flying high as a kite. Foxx seems to be channeling Charles himself, and as he did with the life of Ritchie Valens in La Bamba, director Taylor Hackford gets most of the period details absolutely right as he chronicles Ray's rise from \"chitlin circuit\" performer in the early '50s to his much-deserved elevation to legendary status as one of the all-time great musicians. Foxx expertly lip-syncs to Ray Charles' classic recordings, but you could swear he's the real deal in a film that honors Ray Charles without sanitizing his once-messy life.--Jeff ShannonMore on Ray CharlesModern Sounds in Country and Western Music(CD)The Genius of Ray Charles(CD)Ray Charles and Betty Carter--Dedicated to You(CD)Genius & Soul--The 50th Anniversary Collection(CD)Ray: A Tribute to the Movie, the Music, and the Man(book)More Albums by Ray Charles", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000E8QVWY", "B001P3SA94", "B00465I1CE", "B00005JKMQ", "6305428409", "B003BV8I3Q", "B00AEFXTKO", "B0002LE9HC", "B000BOH8X2", "B00AEFYG3S", "0790739313", "B000JJSL1W", "B000A50460", "B00005TQ44", "0783230524", "B0009R1TJ0", "0780627822", "B00AEFZ63M", "B000P0J092", "B002VWNICM", "B00EV4EUT8", "B000JLTRH2", "B000N6U0E2", "B0041QSZS8", "0783237367", "078324228X", "B00AEFY6TW", "B003HKN534", "B00BTYPWDQ", "B00G4Q3KOC", "B00007AJG1", "B00007L4KF", "B00ANDDBBY", "B000BITV9W", "0783114907", "B00007AJG2", "1558908390", "B00005JLRZ", "B000FVQLQQ", "6305692572", "0767821637", "B002CA68NO", "B00AFEXRME", "B002CPMB9O", "B004SIP93S", "B000063JDI", "B00005NB8K", "B00125WAWS", "6305505780", "B000IFRT4W", "B001TUZGPO", "B009NNM9OA", "B000RB6XG2", "B000P0J0CY", "B0001FR3IQ", "B000FVQLRA", "B00066FAVW", "B002XMGGK6", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00DW5IL2E", "B00005JPK8", "0767811070", "B000I0QL7I", "B000069I0E", "B00080ZG10", "0306814315", "B000P0J0EM", "B00AEFXP8K", "B00049QQHI", "B00000JGHV", "B0007CEXYK", "B0001Q4BOE", "B0000YEE6M", "B000NIVJF4", "B008Y1YJN6", "B00066VTU8", "B001132GNY", "B0006QAIG4", "B0034G4OSG", "B000C20VRS", "0800141741", "B00A2H9QN8", "B000Y11B8K", "B00005LB86", "B000056VP4", "B00005JL72", "B000095J01", "B000Q7ZNZ4", "B002CAWNEM", "B003UESJHO", "B00066FAQW", "0783230389", "B0013FDM7E", "B00007ELEO", "B00AMEZDJW", "B000P0J0CE", "B003Y5H4ZC", "0767821955", "B00003GPFT", "B0021L8V2A"], "bought_together": ["B000E8QVWY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0002LE9HC", "B000E8QVWY", "B000BOH8X2", "B00AZMFJYA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 17277}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.89, "brand": "Universal Studios", "asin": "B00005JND5", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41RQ8ETK19L._SX300_.jpg", "title": "Ray (Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "Despite super effects, a huge budget, and the cinematic pedigree of alien-happy Steven Spielberg, this take on H.G. Wells's novel is basically a horror film packaged as a sci-fi thrill ride. Instead of a mad slasher, however, Spielberg (along with writers Josh Friedman & David Koepp) utilizes aliens hell-bent on quickly destroying humanity, and the terrifying results that prey upon adult fears, especially in the post-9/11 world. The realistic results could be a new genre, the grim popcorn thriller; often you feel like you're watching Schindler's List more than Spielberg's other thrill-machine movies (Jaws,Jurassic Park). The film centers on Ray Ferrier, a divorced father (Tom Cruise, oh so comfortable) who witnesses one giant craft destroy his New Jersey town and soon is on the road with his teen son (Justin Chatwin) and preteen daughter (Dakota Fanning) in tow, trying to keep ahead of the invasion. The film is, of course, impeccably designed and produced by Spielberg's usual crew of A-class talent. The aliens are genuinely scary, even when the film--like the novel--spends a good chunk of time in a basement. Readers of the book (or viewers of the deft 1953 adaptation) will note the variation of whom and how the aliens come to Earth, which poses some logistical problems. The film opens and closes with narration from the novel read by Morgan Freeman, but Spielberg could have adapted Orson Welles's words from the famous Halloween Eve 1938 radio broadcast: \"We couldn't soap all your windows and steal all your garden gates by tomorrow night, so we did the best next thing: we annihilated the world.\"--Doug ThomasWar of the Worldsat Amazon.comThe SoundtrackThe War of the Worlds(1953)War of the Worlds - The Complete First Season(TV series)Classic Sci-Fi Movies and Their RemakesAliens Invade on DVDThe Prog-rock Opera (no kidding)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEBB8VK", "B00005JL78", "B001SGEUYW", "B00008G8M4", "B00005JL3T", "B0013FDM7E", "B00AEFXNLY", "B00005JMXX", "B001OQCV2E", "B000VECAD0", "B002O3Z510", "B0002V7OI8", "B000H30B2C", "B000EGDB10", "B00005JN2Z", "B005LAIIMG", "B005PTYP70", "B002O3Z50G", "B0002V7ON8", "B00005JN0T", "B00K2CHW48", "B002SJIO4A", "0783225547", "B008JFUO36", "B00005JKLZ", "B00AS1Q93S", "1936594056", "B004EPYZUS", "B001TUZG4K", "B00AEFXR1K", "B00001ZWUS", "B00AEFXYJA", "0767817478", "B0034G4ORC", "B003QO8TOQ", "B00070FX5U", "B0045HCJSA", "B00000G3PA", "B005LAIHPE", "B003Y5H5GK", "B00AEBBA72", "B00003CWU3", "B00I9TDMRM", "B001ECDVKE", "B00003CXXP", "B000V4UFZK", "B0010X73ZG", "B001DZOC6Y", "B00005JKFR", "B000XT1P4S", "B003HKN52U", "B0009PW4D2", "B000HRMAPE", "B004EPYZPS", "B0018QPPXW", "B0002WZTOI", "B00AEBB9LO", "B004LWZW4M", "B003ABZHAO", "B003YJFALS", "B0087ZG7HK", "B000OT6V64", "B004P7CN7W", "B000CCBC9O", "B00000ILDD", "0767803434", "B001L57ZYM", "B000065V3G", "B007STBUHI", "B002ZG980U", "B008JFUQZ2", "B00005B6JZ", "B0006GANOQ", "B000F1IQN2", "1494343576", "B001GCUO02", "B00004Y87O", "0783226810", "B004EPYZSK", "B000P0J0BU", "B005LAIHXQ", "B001680M26", "B000EQHXN2", "B0045HCJFS", "B00004BZIY", "B00008G8M5", "B00003CXQA", "B008JFUS0U", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00EIN6KJ0", "B0000DZ6N3", "B000MV8A9A", "B00005JKYX", "B0000YEEGM", "B000TGJ8CQ", "B0013FCWUW", "B002ZG9864", "B00003CWTI", "B008MIMWQW", "B00IKM5OCO"], "bought_together": ["B00AEBB8VK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AEBB8VK", "B004LWZW4M", "B00005JL78", "B004EPYZSK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 18739}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.95, "brand": "Dreamworks Skg", "asin": "B00005JNTI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51upxzPRnXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "War of the Worlds"}
{"description": "Marvel Comics' first family of superherodom, the Fantastic Four, hits the big screen in a light-hearted and funny adventure.  It begins when down-on-his-luck genius Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd,Horatio Hornblower) has to enlist the financial and intellectual help from former schoolmate and rival Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon,Nip/Tuck) in order to pursue outer-space research into human DNA.  Also on the trip are Reed's best friend, Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis,The Shield); his former lover, Sue Storm (Jessica Alba,Dark Angel,Sin City), who's now Doom's employee and love interest; and her hotshot-pilot brother, Johnny Storm (Chris Evans,Cellular).  Things don't go as planned, of course, and the quartet becomes blessed--or is it cursed?--with superhuman powers: flexibility, brute strength, invisibility and projecting force fields, and bursting into flame.  Meanwhile, Doom himself is undergoing a transformation.Among the many entries in the comic-book-movie frenzy,Fantastic Fouris refreshing because it doesn't take itself too seriously. Characterization isn't too deep, and the action is a bit sparse until the final reel (like most \"first\" superhero movies, it has to go through the \"how did we get these powers and what we will do with them\" churn). But it's a good-looking cast, and original comic-book cocreator Stan Lee makes his most significant Marvel-movie cameo yet, in a speaking role as the FF's steadfast postal carrier, Willie Lumpkin. Newcomers to superhero movies might find the idea of a family with flexibility, strength, invisibility, and force fields a retread ofThe Incredibles, but Pixar's animated film was very much a tribute to the FF and other heroes of the last 40 years. The irony is that whileFantastic Fouris an enjoyable B-grade movie, it's the tribute,The Incredibles, that turned out to be a film for the ages.--David HoriuchiOn the DVDThe principal extra on the DVD is a spirited commentary track by Jessica Alba, Michael Chiklis, and Ioan Gruffud.  Self-avowed FF fan Chiklis explains why the Thing doesn't have a craggy brow, Alba recalls which things were \"cool,\" and they talk about looking forward to the sequel. There are three short deleted scenes (including a goofy Wolverine reference), 20 minutes of barely watchable hand-held video footage from the press tour, music videos, and some short featurettes including an appearance by FF creator Stan Lee.--David HoriuchiThe Fantastic Four at Amazon.comComics and Graphic NovelsDisney animated seriesThe classic comic bookMovie tie-in graphic novelThe Xbox gameFantastic FourSoundtrackThe Fantastic CastJessica Albaas Sue StormMichael Chiklisas The ThingIoan Gruffuddas Reed RichardsChris Evansas Johnny StormStills fromFantastic Four(click for larger images)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000VI70QS", "B0000959N0", "B001DHXT20", "B0007P0Y7C", "B004EPZ07K", "B001CDR1FG", "B00E5I2MEK", "B001GCUO1Q", "B00E5I2M9K", "B00E5I2MCM", "B000OVLBF8", "B00005JMQW", "B008JFUO72", "B004LWZW42", "B00E5I2M6I", "B000UR9T8C", "B0090SI56Y", "B000HEVZ9E", "B000HCO83Q", "B00005JKCH", "B005OY6LBE", "B001OQCVI8", "B008JFUS0U", "B004LWZWFQ", "B000AYELVU", "B0002IQMAM", "B003YAR97K", "B0083SBMBM", "B001QB9H1U", "B001AK3S4Y", "B005LAIGW8", "B000AYELVA", "B001F7MSFM", "B0006L0LOS", "B003H8F3AY", "B008JFUPFI", "B006DHAT5K", "B002GSXKN8", "B002ZG99G8", "B00005JNJV", "B002IPFWTE", "B002NXSRVG", "B000VR0570", "B0006D3HGA", "B004LWZWGA", "B005LAII44", "B000YV1Q2G", "B00F4FFO8E", "B005G4TJUC", "B00005JN0T", "B0007US7CQ", "B00E1HIXEI", "B000J10EQU", "B0002KVUKM", "B000VKL6T8", "B001TK80C0", "B002ZG99B8", "B000Y7U98C", "B002GSXKNI", "B00005JM5B", "B001GZ6QC4", "B000PFUAP0", "B00005JKWJ", "B0009P42WI", "B00174RCHW", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B00005JKYX", "B005TK0MFE", "B000VNMMPW", "B001QTXM5Y", "B000EU1Q7M", "B00008G8M4", "B000P6XQ50", "B00005JN5E", "B0007V6ITE", "B001VLBDD0", "B005LAIH54", "B001FB55HQ", "B000IJ79WU", "B008Y1YK9Y", "B00561BNJK", "B001VLFE7G", "B000CNER1S", "B00K7IPFSM", "B001BP4K22", "B00005JL78", "B0001CNRS4", "B00979KQD6", "B00157OI9Q", "B004EPYZUS", "B002HWRYJE", "B009YQJ322", "B003Y5H5EW", "0780624890", "B001RHGRT8", "B0013J55B6", "B0013BM63O", "B0053FANPY", "B009MO57H6", "078401132X"], "bought_together": ["B000VI70QS", "B001DHXT20"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000VI28Z6", "B000VI70QS", "B008JFUS0U", "B0090SI56Y"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 12162}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.98, "brand": "Twentieth Century Fox", "asin": "B00005JNTU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51AM4R5J04L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Fantastic Four (Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "With the slimmest extras package for a Pixar film debuting on DVD,Carsstill shines for home viewing. As with earlier digital-to-digital transfers, the film sounds and looks stunning. There is only one behind-the-scenes feature, a 16-minute cursory but entertaining glance at director John Lasseter's influences (his dad was a car-parts manager), including some of the real-life inspiration for the film such as Michael Wallis's influential book on Route 66 (he also voiced the sheriff). There's a new cartoon for the DVD, \"Mater and Ghost Light,\" which is smile-inducing at best. Four deleted scenes (in storybook format with voices) also show a darker tone the movie may have taken at one point. Best is the adorable short \"One Man Band\" that showed theatrically with the film, and the film's credit sequence can be seen full screen without the credits (and find the Easter egg for an extended version). Not a tricked-out DVD, but still worth a spin.--Doug ThomasCarsat Amazon.comMoreCarsMerchandise at Amazon.comAll Pixar Feature Films on DVDSee What's at Our Disney Store", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001HN6922", "B00F522C7C", "B00BG0RSJ4", "B0030IIZ4M", "B00AFEX83C", "B003Z6YMAA", "B00007LVCM", "B00005JN4W", "B00E9ZATJO", "B00G5G7EXY", "B0013FSL3E", "B000VBJEEG", "B0042U94UQ", "B00275EHJG", "B000MV9026", "B000AY74OG", "B0030IIYYS", "B00GDT5T9Y", "B008YWY0HK", "B00EV1YZ96", "B001KVZ6FW", "B004HO6I4M", "B003ZHVJGO", "B004G600A4", "B0006UEVT0", "B008JFUQ16", "B002ZG97YM", "B0000AOX0O", "B003H9M1Q2", "B00003CXB4", "B00E00OGE2", "7883708422", "B00A83075M", "B00CQRN3QI", "B0039N74CW", "B001ECQ75A", "B00650F5K4", "B00CMY3JBO", "B005ELMC0Q", "B00CTNYLQA", "B000GIXEWC", "B001OMU6UM", "B000YERP2S", "B0084IHVGG", "B000AAF1TU", "B002WJI2QQ", "B00CWM58WY", "B0012EM5D8", "B004EPZ0AC", "B00004U9WQ", "B004USWECA", "073642976X", "B000GUJZ00", "B00BEIYMTW", "B00005JNQS", "0736423915", "B0000VV4W2", "B0001I561E", "B005AUWY90", "B0006JMLRK", "B006HFXD6K", "B00E56D8FO", "B005LAIISA", "B00I6JOD2S", "B00005TN8K", "B00JK531ES", "B000L22SG6", "B00E9ZATKI", "B00CHVJODE", "B00004R99S", "B001DPHDCY", "1450805698", "B000B8QG4A", "0736430520", "B00H5NY7NG", "B0050RQOQM", "B000GW8U1I", "B00003CXCQ", "B0002YLCOM", "B0084IHVN4", "0783231474", "B00B5S33QE", "B004EPZ034", "B004LWZW7Y", "B003BJODJQ", "B007ZXW3H8", "B00FNMNL74", "B005SDUV4E", "B0034JKZ86", "B00009YXAW", "B004USI3G6", "B0051GSZQ4", "B00AVH2UAK", "B00AO686JC", "B0057FGCMS", "B0062RBDHY", "B0090SI1RM", "B00ITX3P2A"], "bought_together": ["B001HN6922", "B00F522C7C"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00F522C7C", "B001HN6922", "B00EV1YZ96", "B003Z6YMAA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 1524}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 24.99, "brand": "Disney", "asin": "B00005JNS0", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51YP4C-LjhL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "More than a few critics hailedSpider-Man 2as \"the best superhero movie ever,\" and there's no compelling reason to argue--thanks to a bigger budget, better special effects, and a dynamic, character-driven plot, it's a notch aboveSpider-Manin terms of emotional depth and rich comic-book sensibility.Ordinary PeopleOscar-winner Alvin Sargent received screenplay credit, and celebrated author and comic-book expert Michael Chabon worked on the story, but it's director Sam Raimi's affinity for the material that bringsSpidey 2to vivid life. When a fusion experiment goes terribly wrong, a brilliant physicist (Alfred Molina) is turned into Spidey's newest nemesis, the deranged, mechanically tentacled \"Doctor Octopus,\" obsessed with completing his experiment and killing Spider-Man (Tobey Maguire) in the process. Even more compelling is Peter Parker's urgent dilemma: continue his burdensome, lonely life of crime-fighting as Spider-Man, or pursue love and happiness with Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst)? Molina's outstanding as a tragic villain controlled by his own invention, and the action sequences are nothing less than breathtaking, but the real success ofSpider-Man 2is its sense of priorities. With all of Hollywood's biggest and best toys at his disposal, Raimi and his writers stay true to the Marvel mythology, honoringSpider-Mancreators Stan Lee and Steve Ditko, and setting the bar impressively high for the challenge ofSpider-Man 3.--Jeff ShannonDVD Features:The first commentary track is by director Sam Raimi and a self-deprecating Tobey Maguire speaking in tandem, and producer (and Marvel CEO) Avi Arad and coproducer Grant Curtis speaking in tandem. They discuss a number of topics, including Raimi's memory of his excitement over Richard Donner's Superman and how the character of Black Cat had to be dropped from the film. The second commentary is by six members of the Oscar-nominated effects team, and one of their primary focuses is how Doc Ock's arms were achieved by a combination of puppetry and CGI.The centerpiece of the second disc is a massive two-hour documentary that can be viewed all at once or in 12 separate pieces. It covers the development of the story, the visual effects, costumes, stunts, and sound and music. Three shorter featurettes cover Peter Parker's struggle between his personal and hero lives, Doc Ock, and the women in Spider-Man's life, and what's interesting is how they discuss those topics not just in relation to the movies but to the comic books as well. (For example, Betty Brant and Gwen Stacy had a much greater impact in the comics.) There's a scene in which you can toggle among three different camera angles, and a gallery of 17 paintings Alex Ross created for the opening sequence. The sound and picture are spectacular, though only theSuperbit editionhas DTS.--David HoriuchiMore Spiderman on DVDTheSpidermanToy StoreThe First FilmSpider Manon the small screenThe SoundtrackGame Boy AdvanceThe BookMore Superheroes on DVDBatmanBladeThe HulkJimmy NeutronJustice LeagueKim PossibleRobocopSpider-ManSupermanWonder WomanX-MenAlso see our Action & Adventure StoreStills fromSpider-Man 2(click for larger image)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000UR9T8C", "B00005JKCH", "B004LWZWFQ", "B001DHXT20", "B00E5I2MCM", "B00005JNTU", "B000VI70QS", "B001CDR1FG", "B001GCUO1Q", "B000AYELVA", "B00E5I2M6I", "B000AYELVU", "B008JFUO72", "B0083SBMBM", "B004LWZW42", "B004EPZ07K", "B00005JNJV", "B0002IQMAM", "B00E5I2MEK", "B000OVLBF8", "B00E5I2M9K", "B000HEVZ9E", "B008QZ5PY2", "B000HCO83Q", "B00JPS7HOA", "B001QB9H1U", "B00IGVJGYQ", "B0000959N0", "B0007P0Y7C", "B002GSXKN8", "B008JFUPFI", "B000J10EQU", "B0007V6ITE", "B0090SI56Y", "B001GZ6QC4", "6307397594", "B008JFUS0U", "B000IJ79VQ", "B000VR0570", "B002ZG99B8", "B00005JKWJ", "B004LWZWGA", "B005G4TJUC", "B002IPFWTE", "B00005JM5E", "B005LAIGW8", "0767817478", "B000H30B2C", "B002A5EBLW", "B0006L0LOS", "B000U7WV1Y", "B0000VCZLG", "B000P0J06K", "B002GSXKNI", "B002HWRYJE", "B0004Z33EQ", "B0009A409S", "B001DJLD2G", "B000I0RQVI", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B0007RT9MG", "B001GKJ2E8", "B0000AXE8I", "B007K3JFUQ", "B00004STUL", "B00BEZTMFY", "B000P0J06U", "B000957O82", "1402778007", "B0039N74CW", "B003UESJF6", "B00F4FFO8E", "B001HN697M", "B001OST0LW", "B0060FXDCG", "B0049IHX2C", "B000P0J0A6", "B000CEVC9M", "B000UVKGPI", "B009JBWOU0", "B00005JM5B", "B00I6JOD2S", "B001EDVNNU", "B000O77SRC", "B0000633UA", "B000P6XQ50", "B000E8M0VA", "B00008G8M4", "B000EGDB10", "B007REV4T8", "B00BPA2PEI", "B008Y1YK9Y", "B005OY6LBE", "0780624890", "B002935GMS", "0767803434", "6305428042", "B000O78KW4", "B009HIKAN8"], "bought_together": ["B000UR9T8C", "B00005JKCH"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004LWZWFQ", "B003YAR97K", "B00005JKCH", "B000UR9T8C"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 9593}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.0, "brand": "Marvel Kids", "asin": "B00005JMQW", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51529JJX43L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Spider-Man 2 (Widescreen Special Edition)"}

{"description": "This two-disc collector's edition ofPirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chestis packed with over five hours of special features that delve into everything from creating the mythology-inspired Davy Jones and Kraken figures, to working and planning without a completed script, the incredible CGI techniques used in the film, the intense sword training sessions and stunt work, and the unpredictability of filming on location in the Caribbean. The audio commentary by writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio is an interesting and insightful look into the finished film, but perhaps even more revealing is the 25-minute \"Charting the Return\" preproduction diary in which everyone from producer Jerry Bruckheimer to associate director Peter Kohn and writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio give a sense of the enormity of the project of concurrently writing and filming two sequels toPirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl. The overwhelming logistics of planning and casting without a finished script, scouting and preparing remote locations, constructing a new Black Pearl, and functional props like the rolling water wheel, and cutting costs to stay within budget are nothing less than mind-boggling. In the hourlong \"According to Plan\" feature, director Gore Verbinski, producer Jerry Bruckheimer, and a host of others detail the enormity of the project, focusing on the stamina involved in a 200-day shooting schedule and the need for adaptability and flexibility in dealing with everything from behind schedule excavations to the logistics of shooting on moving water and even the natural fury of a full-blown hurricane.  Shorter featurettes \"Meet Davy Jones: Anatomy of a Legend\" and \"Creating the Kraken\" focus on the mythological creatures in the film and the awesome visual effects and advances in CGI technology that made them possible.  \"Mastering the Blade\" follows Orlando Bloom (Will Turner), Keira Knightley (Elizabeth Swann), and Jack Davenport (Norrington) through some intense sword-fighting training sessions and \"Fly on the Set: The Bone Cage\" offers a frightening look at what it was like to shoot the bone cage scene of the movie.  Other bonus features include bloopers, an interactive tour of Johnny Depp's special makeup effects and wardrobe details, a look at how the 1967 Disney Land Pirates of the Caribbean ride was recently \"re-imagineered\" to incorporate some of the characters and elements from the new movies, producer Jerry Bruckheimer's photo diary, and a glimpse of the glitzy June 24, 2006 red carpet premiere on Disney Land's main street.--Tami Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000U7WV1Y", "B00005JM5E", "B005COPWZW", "B004A8ZWUQ", "B0013BM63O", "B00005JN5E", "B004M1A21K", "B004DTLK80", "B000VR0570", "B00005JKZV", "B00005JKZY", "B00005JKCH", "B001HN694K", "B00005JPH2", "B00AEFYGBA", "B00BEZTMFY", "B001HQZJMU", "B00E5I2M6I", "B006VRRGNK", "B001BEK8HO", "B000E8M0VA", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B001E75QH0", "B008QE9XD2", "B00E5I2MCM", "B00LG6YEKE", "B00AEBBA72", "B007K3JFUQ", "B000HRMAPE", "B0090SI56Y", "B000E6EK2Y", "B0053FANRC", "B00005JMQW", "B008Y1YK9Y", "B00177YA1K", "B001TK80C0", "B000UR9T8C", "B00003CXI1", "B004EPYZUS", "B00003CXTA", "B001OQCV6A", "B0014Z4ON4", "B005G4TJUC", "B000F7CECK", "B00HFFE8HE", "B001GCUO1Q", "B0087ZG7J8", "B003YAR97K", "B008JFUNTG", "B001GCUO0W", "B000NIBURQ", "B0053FANPY", "B00023B1LC", "B003QO8TOQ", "B002VPE1BQ", "B00F84H73Q", "B003Y5H54W", "B00003CWT6", "B00007AJGH", "B00E5I2M9K", "B000W7F5SS", "B0049IHX2C", "B00000IRE6", "B001F7MSFM", "B000AYELVA", "B002ZG9904", "B000VWYJ86", "B00CFA222M", "B003UYUQZW", "B008UZ949K", "B0002KVUKM", "B000209KMW", "B000UVKGPI", "B0087ZG7HK", "B0000WN140", "B001EZE5BU", "B002PMV9FG", "B000HT386M", "B000NQRR1Q", "B00003CXZ1", "630529142X", "B0002ZDVEU", "B004A8ZWSS", "B00005JM5B", "B000BTITKS", "B00E5I2MEK", "B002HWRYJE", "B001GZ6QC4", "B000W796OM", "B00AQSN7HE", "B0046BI81W", "B001VLBDD0", "B0060FXDCG", "B0084IG8TM", "B005OCFGTO", "B000OLGCIE", "B008JFUS0U", "B00007AJG4", "B009JBWOU0", "B001B3LIOC"], "bought_together": ["B000U7WV1Y", "B00005JM5E"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005COPWZW", "B00005JM5E", "B0071JADFU", "B00005JPFX"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 72898}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 16.95, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B00005JP0F", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GQE7TQ72L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)"}

{"description": "Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's Endis a rollicking voyage in the same spirit of the two earlierPiratesfilms, yet far darker in spots (and nearly three hours to boot). The action, largely revolving around a pirate alliance against the ruthless East India Trading Company, doesn't disappoint, though the violence is probably too harsh for young children. Through it all, the plucky cast (Keira Knightley, Orlando Bloom, Geoffrey Rush) are buffeted by battle, maelstroms, betrayal, treachery, a ferocious Caribbean weather goddess, and that gnarly voyage back from the world's end--but with their wit intact. As always, Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow tosses off great lines ; he chastises \"a woman scorned, like which hell hath no fury than!\" He insults an opponent with a string of epithets, ending in \"yeasty codpiece.\"!In the previousThe Curse of the Black Pearl, Sparrow was killed--sent to Davy Jones' Locker. In the opening scenes, the viewer sees that death has  not been kind to Sparrow--but that's not to say he hasn't found endless ways to amuse himself, cavorting with dozens of hallucinated versions of himself on the deck of the Black Pearl. But Sparrow is needed in this world, so a daring rescue brings him back. Keith Richards' much ballyhooed appearance as Jack's dad is little more than a cameo, though he does play a wistful guitar. But the action, as always, is more than satisfying, held together by Depp, who, outsmarting the far-better-armed British yet again, causes a bewigged commander to muse: \"Do you think he plans it all out, or just makes it up as he goes along?\" As far as fans are concerned, it matters not.--A.T. HurleyOn the DVDHere's something you can't say about just any DVD extras: There appears to bemoreof Keith Richards in the outtakes, interviews, and other special features on theAt World's Enddisc than in the actual film. For those scenes alone, this special edition is well worth the price. Richards looks as woozy and gamey as all the rumors suggested, and answers questions he's not asked, with Johnny Depp sitting next to him, almost acting as a translator. Richards offers pithy comments like, \"Everything I do is original, you better believe,\" and smiles when other cast members call him \"Two-Take Richards\" for supposedly nailing his scenes.The packed second disc also includes a terrific mini-doc on how the filmmakers created the famous maelstrom, in an enormous hanger in Palmdale, California, with the ships floating 30 feet off the ground. \"Just moving theBlack Pearlwas an enormous undertaking,\" says producer Jerry Bruckheimer with serious understatement. Other cool extras include \"Tale of the Many Jacks,\" deleted scenes with great commentary, \"The World of Chow Yun-Fat,\" a bio of composer Hans Zimmer, features on the set designers, a look at the impressive Brethren Court, and some hilarious bloopers. \"You can't curse in a Disney film,\" deadpans Depp when a costar blurts out something blue. \"See? I told him.\" The extras are truly as much of a rollicking adventure as the film.--A.T.

{"description": "Edith Piaf is the subject ofLa Vie en Rose, director Olivier Dahan's powerful if emotionally redundant biographical film about the iconic French superstar whose life, as depicted here, seems to have been a numbing succession of tragedies interrupted on occasion by artistic triumph. Dahan's portrait begins with Piaf's stay in a brothel as a young girl. Left to the care of her grandmother (who runs the place) after her father pulls her away from a narcissistic mother, Piaf undergoes significant health problems and grows up to sing on the street in lieu of outright prostitution. The film pulses along with the usual biopic rhythms, with pivotal moments in the life of Piaf (played as an adult by Marion Cotillard) turning up regularly only to be smacked aside by the unseen hand of perpetual misfortune. There's the impresario (Gerard Depardieu) who recognizes Piaf's great but raw talent only to have a run-in with the criminal element around her. There's the heavyweight fighter (Marcel Cerdan) who becomes the love of Piaf's life but can't be with her. Drug addiction, random car accidents, tax problems, you name it, it's all here, topped by an unnerving revelation that pops up inLa Vie en Rose's final moments. After awhile, with such a concentration of bad news squeezed into 140 minutes, one begins to wish Dahan had taken a more expansive approach to Piaf's life and times. But the film is never less than interesting, and the lead performance by Cotillard is often astonishing.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002LE8MGW", "B004SEUIXS", "B000UVV26A", "B001CIOCLC", "B000002UYD", "B002VKB0M4", "B000YPUFBA", "B002AG2NTI", "B0007Z0NYQ", "B0087IT8FK", "B000MEYIBG", "B0009P7EI2", "B004WDZR0O", "B00279MJHE", "0307268012", "B0069UV0AY", "B001THZAAI", "B005MYEQ4U", "B000002TMF", "B000LXH10I", "B00421IR5I", "B0000C9JFO", "B007I1Q59E", "B00AZNEVNE", "B000I6BJ56", "B000811672", "B00007J5VT", "B008H1Q3QY", "B0002S64SM", "B003L20III", "B00782O7IY", "1613743920", "B005V4X8PO", "B0007A61K6", "B0030MD5TS", "B0019UGYAU", "B0000YEENU", "B0084O26SI", "B004B3254Q", "B0001Y4JO8", "B004ZBFRRG", "B006KDHJMS", "B00A92MEJY", "B000UAE7MM", "B009CSVQ8Q", "B000SAAT76", "B00008979K", "B000CSUNRU", "B000YAA68W", "B004SIP6BI", "B0041KKYF6", "B002QQ8HAG", "B00005JM48", "B00007L4I6", "B000934FC2", "B005CKW8BM", "B004YCKKIM", "B002ONC9NC", "B001AZJKKK", "B0012EI8ES", "B009B8YMB0", "B000053VBN", "B0002V7TI8", "B004UXUUDA", "B008CJ0JS4", "B001DZA3W6", "B0031REQKE", "B000LXHK2C", "B005HISOJ4", "B000B58DHQ", "B000296E7W", "0792833279", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B005CU5OF4", "B0000A1HQP", "B00ENMZK1A", "B00166UFTS", "B000053VBP", "B00CDV4PPK", "B00005AUK9", "B004XVMCMG", "B00005NC66", "B00008G7UF", "B0031SU2Y2", "B00000AVEO", "B000M06KJ8", "B00ANQHR7U", "B004NWPY3E", "B001C71IEM", "B006OB3JVQ", "B00G15MDI0", "B001KVZ6AM", "B0036TGSJE", "B001O549EI", "B0045NXMJE", "B000SSQ7JC", "B004ZG5EYC", "B00000K3TS"], "bought_together": ["B002LE8MGW", "B001CIOCLC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005MYEQ4U", "B002LE8MGW", "B004SEUIXS", "B000UVV26A"]}, "price": 11.14, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 9014}, "asin": "B00005JPX8", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ylggkac7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "La Vie en Rose (Extended Version)"}

{"description": "Nearly 20 years after riding his last Crusade, Harrison Ford makes a welcome return as archaeologist/relic hunter Indiana Jones inIndiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, an action-packed fourth installment that's, in a nutshell, less memorable than the first three but great nostalgia for fans of the series. Producer George Lucas and screenwriter David Koepp (War of the Worlds) set the film during the cold war, as the Soviets--replacing Nazis as Indy's villains of choice and led by a sword-wielding Cate Blanchett with black bob and sunglasses--are in pursuit of a crystal skull, which has mystical powers related to a city of gold. After escaping from them in a spectacular opening action sequence, Indy is coerced to head to Peru at the behest of a young greaser (Shia LaBeouf) whose friend--and Indy's colleague--Professor Oxley (John Hurt) has been captured for his knowledge of the skull's whereabouts. Whatever secrets the skull holds are tertiary; its reveal is the weakest part of the movie, as the CGI effects that inevitably accompany it feel jarring next to the boulder-rolling world of Indy audiences knew and loved. There's plenty of comedy, delightful stunts--ants play a deadly role here--and the return ofRaiderslove interest Karen Allen as Marion Ravenwood, once shrill but now softened, giving her ex-love bemused glances and eye-rolls as he huffs his way to save the day. Which brings us to Ford: bullwhip still in hand, he's a little creakier, a lot grayer, but still twice the action hero of anyone in film today. With all the anticipation and hype leading up to the film's release, perhaps no reunion is sweeter than that of Ford with the role that fits him as snugly as that fedora hat.--Ellen A.

{"description": "Alas! The fifthHarry Potterfilm has arrived. The time is long past that this can be considered a simple \"children's\" series--though children and adults alike will enjoy it immensely. Starting off from the dark and tragic ending of the fourth film,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenixbegins in a somber and angst-filled tone that carries through the entire 138 minutes (the shortest of anyHPmovie despite being adapted from the longest book). Hopes of winning the Quidditch Cup have been replaced by woes like government corruption, distorted media spin, and the casualties of war. As the themes have matured, so have the primary characters' acting abilities. Ron (Rupert Grint), Hermione (Emma Watson), and especially Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) are more convincing than ever--in roles that are more demanding.Harry is deeply traumatized from having witnessed Cedric Diggory's murder, but he will soon find that this was just another chapter in the continuing loss he will endure. Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) has returned and, in an attempt to conceal this catastrophe from the wizarding public, the Ministry of Magic has teamed up with the wizard newspaperThe Daily Prophetto smear young Potter and wise Dumbledore (Michael Gambon)--seemingly the only two people in the public eye who believe the Dark Lord has returned. With no one else to stand against the wicked Death Eaters, the Hogwarts headmaster is forced to revive his secret anti-Voldemort society, the Order of the Phoenix. This welcomes back characters like Mad-Eye Moody (Brendan Gleeson), kind Remus Lupin (David Thewlis), fatherly Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), and insidious Severus Snape (Alan Rickman), and introduces a short list of intriguing new faces. In the meantime, a semi-psychotic bureaucrat from the Ministry (brilliantly portrayed by Imelda Staunton) has seized power at Hogwarts, and Harry is forced to form a secret society of his own--lest the other young wizards at his school be left ill-equipped to defend themselves in the looming war between good and evil. In addition, Harry is filled with an inexplicable rage that only his Godfather Sirius seems to be able to understand.This film, though not as frightening as its predecessor, earns its PG-13 rating mostly because of the ever-darkening tone.  As always, the loyal fans of J.K. Rowling's books will suffer huge cuts from the original plot and character developments, but make no mistake: this is agoodmovie.--Jordan ThompsonOn the DVDThe second disc ofThe Order of the Phoenixfeatures \"The Hidden Secrets of Harry Potter,\" a retrospective on the series so far, with \"Potter experts\" (i.e., people who run fan sites) weighing in on what's to come. This must have been filmed during production, because all their speculation about the conclusion of the saga is clearly dated and therefore superfluous (sinceOrderreleased theatrically at the same time as the seventh book, one would've expected a more current analysis). Many of the deleted scenes are mostly extensions, with the exception of one hilarious take of Professor Trelawney (Emma Thompson) trying--unsuccessfully--to eat gracefully during Dolores Umbridge's introduction at Hogwarts. The chatty actress Natalia Tena, who plays Tonks, gives a tour of the set in \"Trailing Tonks,\" even playing a Christmas song she wrote on her guitar, and director David Yates and editor Mark Day demonstrate editing 101 with a feature that lets you edit your own scene from the movie. Watch the feature but skip the self-editing part; the controls are too complicated to navigate and too frustrating to work properly (plus, hit the wrong button and you've gone all the way back to the beginning). A digital copy of the movie is also included on the bonus disc.--Ellen A.

{"description": "Deservedly hailed as one of the best films of 2001,Witmakes it clear why top-ranking talents seek refuge in the quality programming of HBO. Unhindered by box-office pressures, director Mike Nichols and Emma Thompson turn the most unglamorous topic--the physical and psychological ravages of cancer--into an exquisite contemplation of life, learning, and tenacious, richly expressed humanity. In adapting Margaret Edson's compassionate, Pulitzer Prize-winning play, Nichols and Thompson open up the one-room setting with a superb supporting cast. But their focus remains on the hospital experience of Vivian (Thompson), a fiercely demanding professor of English literature whose academic specialty--the metaphysical poetry of John Donne--is the armor she wears against the cruel indignities of her cancer treatment. While losing all that she held dear, she reassesses her life as an aloof intellectual, andWitilluminates her bracingly eloquent and deeply moving struggle for dignity, meaning, and peace at life's ultimate crossroads.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0571198775", "B00008L3U4", "B00664AM02", "B00067BCBI", "B00000F5MN", "B00BTYJYP8", "0061137596", "B000068MBW", "B00005RDAN", "082633038X", "B005TZFZBU", "B0001CNRAM", "0061230979", "B0007WFUGK", "1573226572", "B00005AQMJ", "B00003CXC9", "0826330371", "B0007LFPJ8", "082221704X", "032308334X", "B00000IQV7", "B00B8X4WBG", "B004YCKKIM", "0553210351", "0971907498", "B00AEBB9FA", "B000TV1ST2", "B00KMULA9I", "1468014315", "B004QL7KKC", "B0001I2BUI", "B004AE3QYE", "B0043X1FL8", "0965464911", "B004OE9P2C", "B001OQCV1K", "0679742441", "B002D755AI", "0345425979", "B00008L3SE", "B00J5LXQKQ", "B000R7HY00", "B00BTYHBX0", "B0073U2EWM", "1451624123", "B0063HO5C8", "0803617844", "B005DXCOY4", "B00K6D1SAC", "B0007QJ1W0", "B000063ING", "B0002J4X20", "B00AEBB8YM", "1605477303", "0135080908", "1451667256", "0767821432", "0763765422", "1449649009", "B001TKNWUU", "B001GF8WPI", "0132706687", "B00GPWEPZ8", "B00006L92W", "B007CK3NYG", "B0006IIPM6", "B00005JKWX", "0375757759", "B0015OKWKI", "B0000714BZ", "B000K7VHQE", "0787976385", "B0011V7PSC", "0763773840", "B00004TJKK", "B0015OKWKS", "B000F1IQNM", "B0013K2ZGI", "0095234772", "B0007P0YKY", "B0000CE684", "0470959584", "B00005YUO1", "0140422099", "B00GUO2SKA", "0801478731", "0767805712", "B000H0MKOC", "B0018YCF50", "0783227906", "0826157912", "0064430189", "B00AEFYSWM", "1594733120", "B00000JMOF", "0060775823", "1558101764", "B00003CX8U", "B00005BCK9"], "bought_together": ["0571198775"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00BTYJYP8", "0571198775", "B00008L3U4", "0826330371"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 12441}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 19.99, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00005MKKV", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41MQWHl-FRL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Wit"}

{"description": "Based on the shocking true story, Miss Evers' Boys exposes a 40-year government backed medical research effort on humans which led to tragic consequences. It is 1932 when loyal, devoted Nurse Eunice Evers (Alfre Woodard) is invited to work with Dr. Brodus (Joe Morton) and Dr. Douglas (Craig Sheffer) on a federally funded program to treat syphilis patients in Alabama. Free treatment is offered to those who test positive for the disease included Caleb Humphries (Laurence Fishburne) and Willie Johnson (Obba Babatunde). But when the government withdraws its funding, money is offered for what will become known as \"The Tuskegee Experiment\", a study of the effects of syphilis on patients who don't receive treatment. Now the men must be led to believe they are being cared for, when in fact they are being denied the medicine that could cure them. Miss Evers is faced with a terrible dilemma-to abandon the experiment and tell her patients, or to remain silent and offer only comfort. IT is a life or death decision that will dictate the course of not only her life, but the lives of all of Miss Evers' Boys.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00067BCBI", "B00006LPHJ", "B00319ECI8", "B0000560W6", "B0006IIOHC", "B0000DZ3G2", "B00465I192", "B00441GZ1Y", "B000BNTM9G", "B002D755AI", "B0058KGHX6", "B00CDWQNZ4", "B00125WAWS", "B000WMA73G", "B003BV8I3Q", "B0009S4IGA", "B00066VTU8", "B002WBYDLC", "B0000DZ3EV", "B0000399WJ", "B000BNTMBO", "B000244GCW", "B0001CNRAM", "B00007AJG2", "B000068MBW", "B0045HCJHQ", "B00005MKKV", "B001E1HCRI", "B00CDZBSBK", "B004FK5EDY", "6305428336", "B000XA5JWG", "B000053V7G", "B000YGE18C", "B00BYS0RQE", "B000E0OBCO", "B002CWKU36", "B00A144O20", "1449697496", "B000JLTRH2", "B0043X1FL8", "B005LAIGN2", "B00005JKWX", "B002ZG97J2", "B00008L3U4", "B000Q7ZNZ4", "B004AR4VRW", "B005CGI4O6", "B000Y11B8K", "B0006HBJJS", "B000B5XOSY", "B0069UP2PI", "B000053V7F", "0822214644", "B004D45NY2", "B00EV4EUT8", "0783230524", "B00JPFTS2M", "B00005JL2W", "B00769U94K", "B000P0J092", "B001TKNWUU", "B006JN86VW", "B00000IQV7", "B00H91LVTM", "B000UVKHNY", "B005KRR8GC", "B000K2UGZM", "0800141806", "B00GSBQ2HU", "B003VEL8ZS", "B00069FLAY", "B000EWBKI0", "B001OQCV1K", "B0046GDMV8", "B00465I1CE"], "bought_together": ["B00067BCBI", "B002D755AI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00067BCBI", "B002D755AI", "B00125WAWS", "B00006LPHJ"]}, "price": 5.0, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 17098}, "asin": "B00005RDAN", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51NsTuJBW5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Miss Evers' Boys"}

But when they zero in on an oddball loner (Buscemi) looking for Miss Right, their seemingly innocent meddling threatens to shatter one of their hearts not to mention their lifelong friendship.", "related": {"also_bought": ["1560974273", "B0000U0X20", "0767827740", "B000H6SXSI", "B00DW5IKYS", "1560978902", "B00005NC02", "B000NJXC4Y", "B00K0MM4AM", "B0000WN15O", "B00005Y6X6", "B00JJ3EHCG", "B0017VG5XM", "B000092T3X", "B001CW7ZT4", "B004SUDQDQ", "B0000640VJ", "B00006CXGZ", "B000ELL1RG", "B001RLW9ZK", "B00000IC7G", "B0053TWVQ4", "B00005JLRE", "B00005JMJ4", "B0012E2GFK", "6305594333", "B000QUEQ4K", "B002NJBPXC", "B000F7CEC0", "B00013RC2K", "B00JQF7ZR6", "B0002I83Z4", "B00FGVS0FA", "6305428239", "B00H9HZITU", "B000SFJ4HW", "B000087F7E", "B0050ODZ6M", "B00EOBB7LC", "B00005U14H", "B0000CDUT5", "B00007AJF8", "0767837398", "B002VPTJOA", "B000059H98", "B0019N8P2W", "B0007VZ9D0", "0767835093", "B000069I0A", "B000BX8R1A", "B000M06KJ8", "B0002V7O0Q", "B0007UC8Y4", "B00JVQ7PWU", "B001713CMY", "B00005QCVX", "B000HC2M2A", "B005C7SXMS", "B00005O5CA", "B00IXD2LI0", "B00GPPXNQ2", "B00005JMJG", "B00GPPXNIK", "B000GI3KGC", "B00027JYLC", "B000063JDE", "B00005JM23", "B00441GYVK", "B006Z7Z3VS", "B009M4KTUG", "B00AEBB8ZG", "B002TZS5NI", "B00006JMQ4", "B00005JKJA", "B00AEFXE9U", "B004OUZLGK", "B00JAQJNN0", "B001NPD9PY", "B00003CXZ4", "B000FVQM2Y", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B00009MEC4", "B00003CWQR", "0792844033", "0767830555", "B00HXH00ZI", "B00KCTG4PO", "B002U6DVPS", "B0040QE7UE", "B0057ZAA6W", "B00003CWSX", "B000065K5H", "B00005AX6G", "B000BB14IA", "B006OV7RQ4", "B00A2H9QN8", "1435242211", "B00827OWO8", "B008220DGE", "B000286RNE"], "bought_together": ["1560974273"], "buy_after_viewing": ["1560974273", "0767827740", "B0007UC8Y4", "B000ELL1RG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 16829}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 33.99, "brand": "BIRCH,THORA", "asin": "B00005T30L", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/410B7RNYNGL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Ghost World"}

{"description": "Innocuous, innocent, and somewhat idiotic, Disney's bubbleheaded road-movie comedy plays as a farcical remake of the 1976 cult TV-movie melodramaThe Boy in the Plastic Bubble. Jake Gyllenhaal is the goodhearted innocent raised in a sort of human Habitrail of plastic rooms and rubber tunnels. To win back the girl of his dreams (Marley Shelton), he steps out of his indoor greenhouse and into a homemade Ziplock bubble suit. It's the usual story: naive innocent bounces down the highway like a beach ball with legs and wins over the wacky supporting cast of soft-hearted bikers, zombielike teenage cultists, and orphaned \"freaks\" through purity and pluck. The premise wears thin after a while, but Gyllenhaal keeps the film bounding along with goofy innocence and energetic eagerness. Swoosie Kurtz costars as his religious-zealot clinging mom. Watch for Fabio in an inspired cameo.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00003CXPS", "6305433925", "B00005V9HR", "B00AEFXPG2", "B00005JKJJ", "B00005YUPD", "B0045HCJRG", "B00008L3W3", "B000CEPE5A", "B00102F5WK", "B0000797IO", "6305428549", "B00005JLOB", "B00006JU8B", "B00003CXIS", "B00441GYVA", "B004SUDQ22", "630529142X", "B001R23GBU", "B001FB55L2", "B001ECDVKE", "B000VXWX7E", "B00LBHOCHS", "B00DW5IL92", "B004L3AR0K", "B0000AC8LR", "B000089778", "B00008K7AM", "B00BLN4UPG", "B00BTYNXJG", "B000069HQ2", "B00003CXS7", "B00005RYLX", "B000EMGJAO", "B00005JOFQ", "B000DZIGDU", "B0023TCWE8", "B004GJYRA0", "B00AEFXIUK", "B00005JH9O", "B00AEFZE48", "B000FP2OPO", "B000031EFY", "0783227345", "B0006FYOTC", "B00BLN4V0A", "B000QUU4MS", "B002NZK5U0", "B0007KIFXW", "0783226896", "B0009ZE9VW", "B0006HBZE2", "B000089773", "0783230494", "B000ELJAEM", "B00AEFYPXY", "B000A0GP0Y", "B00007JMEB", "B004XQO90O", "B002XUBDRY", "0780625528", "B00E1HIX66", "B0016MJ6GA", "B0006GANPA", "B000WZEZGI", "B0015RRNN4", "B00000F0AD", "6305870179", "B001G5T6GW", "B00005PJ6N", "B003UYUQZW", "B00005JMX6", "B00003CXK7", "B00000K3U4", "B000EGDBZ6", "B00008979O", "B000MNOXYY", "B001GC9VK6", "B00005JM4Q", "B00005NGAY", "B00AEBB9GY", "B000BUE5E6", "B00AEBB89W", "B000QUU7L6", "B00008L3U1", "0792840127", "1558908404", "B00005QT9P", "B00AG4714S", "B000089771", "B004SIP7K8", "B00005PJ6M", "B00006ADFT", "B008220CQU", "B00049QQHI", "B004P7CN5O", "B0050PYNP8", "B002GHHHL0", "B004HO6I2E", "0790751445"], "bought_together": ["6305433925", "B0045HCJRG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00003CXPS", "B000CEPE5A", "6305433925", "B0045HCJRG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 22273}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.5, "brand": "DISNEY", "asin": "B00005U8QN", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51B5N45K6VL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Bubble Boy"}

{"description": "Boy, the way the Beaver played. Ricky Nelson made the hit parade. Voices they were seldom raised. Those were the days. And then, on January 12, 1971, America met the Bunkers, and sitcoms would never be the same. The Bunkers were TV's first dysfunctional family: blue-collar bigot Archie (the late Carroll O'Connor in his iconic role), his long-suffering but loving wife Edith (Jean Stapleton), \"little goil\" Gloria (Sally Struthers), and her liberal husband \"Meathead\" Mike (Rob Reiner). Series creator Norman Lear broke near every rule and taboo in adapting the British series \"Till Death Do Us Part\" for American television. The series pilot, \"Meet the Bunkers,\" was a bracing shocker that dared to find humor in prejudice. Archie dispenses racial epithets and ethnic slurs. Mike and Gloria clearly have an active sex life, while Edith, in the pilot at any rate, is more \"pip\" than \"dingbat.\" In its first season, the series refused to, in Archie's words, \"stifle\" itself, tackling such hot-button topics as homophobia (\"Judging Books by Covers\"), racism (\"Lionel Moves into the Neighborhood\"), feminism (\"Gloria Discovers Women's Lib\"), and the generation gap (the touching \"Success Story,\" with William Windom as Archie's former army buddy, a successful man who is revealed to be estranged from his son).All in the Familywas a rich human comedy. Brought to life by a peerless ensemble, these characters would come to feel like family. Their foibles produced some of television's biggest laughs. They could also make us cry, as with the heartbreaking \"Gloria's Pregnancy.\" Another series landmark is the season finale, \"The First and Last Supper,\" in which we meet Isabel Sanford's Louise Jefferson (but, hilariously, not her husband, George).All in the Familywas an instant lightning rod for controversy but went on to earn the comedy Emmy Award in its first year. This three-disc set has no extras (future sets will hopefully contain commentary by Lear or surviving cast members), but each episode is presented complete and uncut, restoring the funny, sometimes touching codas that were cut for syndication.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002E58FTW", "B002E58FUG", "B002E58FTM", "B002E58FTC", "B002E58FU6", "B000068V9Y", "B000TD2KY2", "B000TD0PHG", "B000255LG6", "B005KK2FTO", "B000068V9X", "B00465I13S", "B00008R9MC", "B00008EY6N", "B0000BV1XX", "B00005JLIC", "B0002NY8R6", "B001DMVZJ4", "B002JH2EJM", "B000NJMJHA", "B000MGBSH6", "B0000DFZ5O", "B00007KK5I", "B001DSNEME", "B00008NV4G", "B000291Q3Y", "B00007KK5J", "B000MGTQ6G", "B00GOC760U", "B000291Q3O", "B00096S480", "B0002NY8PI", "B00IJZW35I", "B0007OCG74", "B000YKYT1M", "B008KZX7W0", "B00D2UMHB0", "B000CELOW2", "B000CCBCCG", "B0000B1A5A", "B0085Z6Z2O", "B000YGGNGK", "B000A0GXGK", "B00GOC74OI", "B00008EYBH", "B001AZIRY0", "B00009VRF0", "B008K1PWMW", "B0001O3YHQ", "B000G0O5JG", "B000QUEQ6I", "B0009B16TO", "B000AMJG5I", "B0085Z6ZD8", "B0006Q93BU", "B001OXLGK0", "B00D2UMHSI", "B0006N2EZK", "B006OKOXKS", "B000PHX5KU", "B0001AVZDU", "B0002I837M", "B000K7UBXE", "B000286S42", "B00I86MQF0", "B0089BSLKS", "B004XZ99XC", "B0007R4SWC", "B000BOH8YQ", "B000E1MXWI", "B000A9QKSM", "B006MFQ4DE", "B0002W4SX6", "B0007KIFK0", "B001DMVZJO", "B0050MB5AC", "B0011N19HI", "B001DSNELU", "6305957878", "B000WQWPSW", "B000EQ45BU", "B000EXDS02", "B004M20YBW", "B0002JZT5U", "B0001DMXEC", "B001HUHBC2", "B00D2UMI7I", "B0001NBNIY", "B0002Y4T7O", "B00GLT2SOA", "B008L36520", "B000MXPE6U", "B00A2L1CKO", "B00DJYK1XU", "B00005JMHI", "B005SQRYOG", "B0000E32X2", "B0058J3S16", "B00093GVWY"], "bought_together": ["B002E58FTW", "B002E58FUG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B008HUSFTS", "B002E58FTW", "B000WN5DYS", "B002E58FTM"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 51445}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 28.63, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B00005Y4RZ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51CMyNSiWPL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "All in the Family - The Complete First Season"}
{"description": "Grab your favorite munchies, kids. Red and Meth, that dope-addled dynamic duo, are going to Harvard! And while it's not an episode ofMasterpiece Theatre,How Highis destined to become a guilty pleasure of the cannabis crowd. The plot's a familiar one--take the basic selling points of any Cheech & Chong movie (a pair of shambolic protagonists who smoke lots of weed while slinging slang and driving funky, '70s-style cars), graft them onto a generic \"raising hell on campus\" teen movie scenario, and shake vigorously. The result is a prosaic effort that does contain some all-too-brief moments of genuine humor. Red and Meth, a.k.a. Redman and Method Man, may look like the world's oldest freshmen, but both offer genial performances, especially Method Man, who imbues the character of Silas with a dog-eared gentleness that raises him above the film's leaden script and plasticine directing.--Rebecca Levine", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0006HBZE2", "B00006HAYO", "B004P7CMZ0", "B000069DOB", "B001DJLD12", "B000EMGJAO", "6304821832", "B00003CY51", "B0000YEE6M", "0780631234", "B007VYEE0A", "6305505780", "B004H83INW", "B00BTYPWDQ", "B004SIP93S", "B001J9KJ4I", "B0002J4YVK", "B000BITV9W", "B00AEFYE08", "1558908390", "B002CA68MU", "B000UNYJWM", "0767813901", "B002CA68NO", "B00003GPFT", "B00ANDDBBY", "B000FS9ULC", "B00007ELEO", "B00005JLQT", "B00000JGHV", "B0000AGQ6T", "B002GSXKO2", "B00005JLG1", "B002CA68N4", "B0000714BU", "B0041QSZ9M", "B00004Y2R1", "0767811070", "0767821955", "B00AEFYAC0", "B00AG4714S", "B0000AC8LH", "B000CPH9PM", "B000JRYOPG", "0783237367", "B000071ZZJ", "B000EQ45CE", "B0000JBUHI", "B00007BK2S", "B000IZJZIU", "B00003CXS7", "0780627822", "B00AMSM9AO", "B00003CXPS", "B000060MWA", "B000WZEZGI", "B001AEF6HM", "B0000TWMTS", "B004QL7K70", "B001TUZGPO", "B00E1HIXA2", "B000089729", "B005SHBO1Y", "B000RETOHO", "B00E1HIX66", "B0000TWMWK", "B00068WOH8", "B0019X3YZA", "B00003CXWV", "B000VG66XS", "B0034G4P1C", "B000C20VRS", "B00009W5F2", "B002GSXKOM", "B003NH6FY2", "B00005JLQE", "B000SM6FLI", "B00005JD5J", "B00AEFYQWO", "B00029RTAI", "B008DL4KZY", "B00AEFY0XE", "B00066FAQW", "B00DW5IL2E", "B0041QSZS8", "B00AEBB9AA", "B00BLN4V46", "B00007BK2T", "B004499NII", "B002VWNIEA", "630529142X", "B00005JKMN", "B00AEFXPG2", "B00AMEZDJW", "B0023TCWE8", "B002FOFX9M", "B00441GYVA", "B000HDZKLO", "B002CA68MK", "B00AEFYZCU"], "bought_together": ["B0006HBZE2", "B000EMGJAO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0006HBZE2", "B001DJLD12", "B004H83INW", "B000EMGJAO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 10968}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.68, "brand": "UNI DIST CORP.

It's killer instinct vs. sophisticated technology, deadly jaws vs. harpoon-tipped torpedoes, mega-shark vs. modern man is a thrilling extreme deep sea fight to the death.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000PFU83O", "B000A2X4AG", "B008DL4LQ2", "B006BZ8NZM", "B00DCLTA6Y", "B007V4QLXI", "1573627488", "B005CHV14A", "B000055WFV", "B00D9EJFZA", "B004NTC7G4", "B0009XT8UQ", "B002GHHHL0", "B00018D3UU", "B00H4KQN82", "B000KRN262", "B000A2X3NE", "B00B2V65LY", "B00023BN3S", "B004USUP58", "B00D9EJFV4", "B00008WFU4", "B009H3LP64", "B00064AE0G", "B000CSUNLG", "B00005A8XX", "B003954IV0", "B004FHCHAU", "B001D8W7CW", "B004RBC5S8", "B007PVHB9K", "B000AC7OXO", "B00H4BVS4A", "B004USUOTK", "B001GJ4TV0", "B004LS6CN6", "B00151QYBW", "B0024F08P6", "B000A2X4B0", "B000067J2Z", "B00004YS59", "B000AJJMNW", "B005J039H2", "B00834JR18", "B001VC99HG", "B000NA1W2W", "B00125WAS2", "B00A3TFK58", "B001UDS4D6", "B00005BCP6", "B004W5MHGY", "B001U4183I", "B007P636CQ", "B006NKFAB0", "B00AU2AYXQ", "B001PPLJKY", "B000A2X3PW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0085Z3C0M", "B000AJJMNW", "B000PMFRTW", "B002GHHHL0"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 559131}, "asin": "B000069HYJ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DJZSNZV8L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Shark Hunter"}

{"description": "The new short film \"Scrat's Missing Adventure: Gone Nutty\" showcases the well-timed animation--strongly influenced by Chuck Jones's Road Runner-Wile E. Coyote shorts--that made that frantic little character so effective as a comic foil. It's interesting to compare the Oscar&#xAE;-winning short \"Bunny\" withIce Age. The viewer can see the Blue Sky artists developing the more angular and less detailed look that's become the studio's signature. Like Sid the Sloth, the title character in \"Bunny\" suggests a slightly frayed walk-around figure from a theme park; the texture of her coat anticipates the old-chenille-bathrobe look of Manny the Mammoth's pelt. The clips in different languages, trailers, directors' commentary, and making-of features feel rather standard, but listening to John Leguizamo experiment with different voices before settling on the exaggerated lisp for Sid offers an unusual and funny insight into the development of an animated character.--Charles Solomon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000GUJZ00", "B001GCUNWQ", "B005LAIISA", "B000MV9026", "B004HO6I4M", "B000AY74OG", "B001DPHDCY", "B002WJI2QQ", "B0006JMLRK", "B0012EM5D8", "B0000AOX0O", "B00CWM58WY", "B005QODEEE", "B0039N74CW", "B00005JNQS", "B00003CXJ4", "0783231474", "B001ECQ75A", "B00BG0RSJ4", "B0000640SC", "B001NCDFTW", "B004EPZ034", "B000M343BC", "B000RMJ4F8", "B0042U94UQ", "B00007LVCM", "B00AFEX83C", "B0000VV4W2", "B000UVKGPI", "B00005JMQZ", "B0013FSWT2", "B00G5G7EXY", "B008JFUQ16", "B002ZG97YM", "6305161887", "B0030IIZ4M", "B00005JNS0", "B0013FSL3E", "B005SDUV4E", "B00CHVJODE", "B00EBBGLFC", "B00EV1YZ96", "B001GCUO7A", "B005LAIHW2", "B00E9ZATJO", "B000056H26", "B00029LO0Y", "B000VBJEEG", "B006JD48LO", "B00F522C7C", "B005LAIH4A", "B003H9M1Q2", "B004G600A4", "B00005JM7T", "B005F96UJ6", "B00365F6I2", "B008YWY0HK", "B0030IIYYS", "B00JK531ES", "B00947N6D8", "B001OMU6UM", "B00GDT5T9Y", "B001ILFUD2", "B00000JL8E", "B000L22SG6", "B001GCUNW6", "B001KVZ6FW", "B00009YXAW", "B004LWZW7Y", "B001HN6918", "B003ZHVJGO", "B000065V42", "B00HLTD2OE", "B00275EHJG", "B00E00OGE2", "B00003CXB4", "B001HN6922", "B001U3D88M", "B002ZG9904", "B000H7JCK0", "B000AAF1TU", "B00005JMFH", "B001LPWGFA", "B008NNY9QW", "B009PPO78W", "B000LPS2VI", "B003E66Y84", "B00157OICI", "B003UESJF6", "B00003CXG7", "B001O5LVPI", "B000EQ5UHS", "B00028HBES", "B0000VCZKW", "B000ROAK2W", "B00ALMNCLQ", "B00I6JOD2S", "B000YERP2S", "B00CTNYLQA", "B00H5NY7NG"], "bought_together": ["B004HO6I4M"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004HO6I4M", "B005LAIISA", "B00IEXX4KS", "B000MV9026"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 126280}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 13.07, "brand": "20th Century Fox", "asin": "B00006CXHU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5150B79E6SL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Ice Age (2-Disc Special Edition)"}

When workers in a London tunneling project awaken an unearthly fire-breathing beast from centuries of slumber, all hell breaks loose. Twelve-year-old Quinn (Bale) sees his mother, one of the workers, die trying to escape this new terror. Twenty years later as a \"fire chief,\" he tries to keep a group of refugees alive with fierce dragons dominating the air, burning the land and feeding on the ash. Unexpectedly, Van Zan (McConaughey), a hotshot American militia leader, shows up with a ragtag group of slayers on a perilous crusade to hunt down and destroy the beasts. Tempers flare when there is a struggle for leadership -- until both men realize only one species is getting out of this alive.", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783225814", "B00005JLWN", "B00AEFXT7W", "B001EAWMGA", "B0000WN0SW", "6305692688", "B00006AUJR", "B000MGUZCU", "B000R9U3B0", "B000VKL6ZM", "B00002E20R", "B00007AJF4", "B00AEFZ2DG", "B000NA28I4", "B00003CXHJ", "B000Y7U98C", "B000CBCWRG", "B00000JMOD", "B002SG7Z7A", "B00AEBB8QK", "B0002YLCG0", "B000CNER1S", "B000WMA6R8", "B000N6TX1I", "B004BZ5AN2", "6304711891", "B00HOGBXS6", "B0007OCG5Q", "B000KX0IM2", "B001FU793A", "B003L20IG0", "B00IKM5LXG", "B002NZK5SM", "B002GHHHKQ", "B00HEPDGKA", "B002GIBVVQ", "B003L20IEW", "B00005JN0T", "B002ZG98N2", "B003C5FMNK", "B00D3LA5WG", "6304806434", "B004XFZ4JK", "0767817478", "B005LAIHSG", "B002UZCJ8Y", "B000G8P1Y6", "B002GHHHHO", "B00AEFXVCU", "B000095WW8", "B000IHY9TS", "B000093FLA", "B00027NVXE", "B000MXPE7O", "B001FB55HQ", "B0009MDPYM", "B0018O4YT0", "B00IIJ9F42", "B002NZK5VO", "B001OQCUZM", "B008JFUQZ2", "B002QW7ALM", "B00003CXSD", "B00AEBB91O", "B0068FZ0O2", "B004XQO90O", "B000MX7V70", "B0021L8UXA", "B007I1Q4W2", "B0012KJ0DK", "B000EQHXN2", "B004LWZW8I", "B0000844I8", "B003Z8ZC1G", "B007WZTMCI", "B000LC55F2", "B001EDVNNU", "B00AZTUUQK", "B001VLBDD0", "B005LAIHPE", "B002UOMH00", "B004EPYZOO", "B003AWRMCE", "B00AEBB89W", "B00CHMBQM0", "B00AJLHUA8", "B000YDOOEQ", "B00005JL78", "B0002V7OI8", "B0045HCIWW", "B00AEFXWXI", "B00AEFYW64", "B000FS9FCG", "0783231202", "B00005JMZK", "B004EPYZU8", "B000274T94", "B0013FDM7E", "B00AEFYXQI", "B00AEFXKZ8"], "bought_together": ["0783225814", "B00AEFXT7W"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AEFZ2DG", "B004SBQAN8", "B0067EKYAY", "B00HWWUQWQ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 15002}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.0, "brand": "Touchstone Video", "asin": "B00006JDVV", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51zLrfJuG3L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Reign of Fire"}

{"description": "One of the most acclaimed series on TV during its brief run from 1994-1995,My So-Called Lifepioneered the modern teen drama and made a star out of 15-year-old Claire Danes. Ostensibly centering around the trials and tribulations of high schooler Angela Chase,My So-Called Lifeactually expanded to include everyone in its protagonist's orbit, from school friends to extended family, and gave its stellar ensemble cast ripe material to work with during its too-short life. Produced bythirtysomethingcreators Marshall Herskovitz and Edward Zwick,MSCLevoked that yuppie-friendly show with its emphasis on finding extraordinary drama within ordinary situations, but was far more heartfelt and heart-wrenching, echoing the dizzying highs and lows of adolescence. As such, it developed a cult following among young viewers who identified strongly with Angela's high school traumas and followed her every move with rapt attention. (After cancellation, the show enjoyed a popular reprise on MTV.)Avoiding the sensational,My So-Called Lifetackled every teen hot-button issue imaginable (and pioneered the then-controversial topic of teen homosexuality), but with a clear-eyed perspective, never dissolving into soap opera-&#x96;even when Angela mooned over heartthrob Jordan Catalano (dreamy Jared Leto). Even as it mined adolescent angst, though,My So-Called Lifenever lost sight of its adults, with Bess Armstrong and Tom Irwin both phenomenal as Angela's parents, whose marriage was one of the most complex seen on TV since... well,thirtysomething. Through it all, Golden Globe winner and Emmy nominee Danes was a neurotic, touching, and funny center, whether obsessing over a zit or negotiating the rocky terrain of first love. Her funny, sobering, and empathetic portrait of teendom reminded us that in some ways, life was just an extended version of high school.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0001EQHXO", "B00005YUPD", "B0019N8P2W", "B00606OZUY", "B0077PTWY6", "B00K1EKVD6", "B0077PTWHI", "B00008977H", "B000QGEB1M", "B00006AFUR", "B00BGQ2NIO", "B000A7Q2DM", "B007AFBYA8", "B0029LHW68", "B00BN3DZZA", "B000068MC2", "B00H3JHGBC", "B00BGQ2NDO", "B005BYBZKY", "B00LBHOCHS", "B00020HB32", "B0001IN0T4", "B00004W21Z", "B00HZN8TBC", "B00JK47BHM", "B000FUTVPA", "B00F77MAC2", "B00J4BW0SQ", "B007RMQ56M", "B000TGURZ8", "B00CRVL5WC", "B00005Q4CS", "B00BUT5I84", "B00369ERC4", "B000MGB6NM", "B00AEBB8O2", "B00092ZM7U", "B001AR60GK", "B00JMXWPU4", "B006363QHE", "B009DA74BG", "B005CGI3ZG", "B000X07SQ6", "B002KQ6UE2", "B003R0MF6W", "B00KUS5YGC", "B00HUCF7WW", "B005CA4SOM", "B008MCKLAM", "B003LXM1PK", "B000BNXD6O", "B00DUCXFUC", "B00DY9528Y", "B000V6LSO0", "B000I2J736", "B00L9K2EGS", "0679877894", "B00009OOFH", "B0027CSMY0", "B0051PLQR0", "B00IGVJH0E", "B00KADPBTW", "B0007TKHKC", "B001U9BS2O", "B00127RAGM", "B000087EZC", "0767824954", "6305821216", "B00AEFXO8Q", "B008MCKL5W", "B00JJOY41E", "B00005JLEJ", "B00HRCBGRA", "B000NOKFGW", "B001D2WUDE", "B00DL47424", "B001CDFY5U", "B0033WH6MW", "B000EAT23C", "B001GP5TMW", "B001957A44", "B001B3LIQA", "B002PQ7JQK", "B00GUO3C3W", "B000LXH3SI", "B00C7A8WWO", "B00HUCF6KK", "B00K31RC52", "B000AJHIT2", "B00IYRLUEG", "B00D9EJG54", "B009LDD4I2", "B001UHOWYM", "B0089J2818", "B000HWZ4MA", "B00GUO2SKA", "B001CQONOA", "B0030ATZHQ", "B007ZR9HP0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0001EQHXO", "B0077PTWY6", "B0077PTWHI", "0792842502"]}, "price": 32.53, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 116311}, "asin": "B00006SFLV", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41JY8SM8GDL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "My So-Called Life: Complete Series"}

{"description": "Academy Award(R)-nominee Edward Norton (Best Actor, 1999, AMERICAN HISTORY X) heads an amazing all-star cast in the critically acclaimed Spike Lee (SUMMER OF SAM, DO THE RIGHT THING) film 25th HOUR. In 24 short hours Monty Brogan (Norton) goes to prison for seven long years.  Once a king of Manhattan, Monty is about to say good-bye to the life he knew -- a life that opened doors to New York's swankest clubs but also alienated him from the people closest to him.  In his last day on the outside, Monty tries to reconnect with his father (Brian Cox, THE BOURNE IDENTITY), and gets together with two old friends, Jacob (Philip Seymour Hoffman, ALMOST FAMOUS) and Slaughtery (Barry Pepper, THE GREEN MILE).  And then there's his girlfriend, Naturelle (Rosario Dawson, MEN IN BLACK 2), who might (or might not) have been the one who tipped off the cops. Monty's not sure of much these days, but with time running out, there are choices to be made as he struggles to redeem himself in the 25th hour.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001MZ5W3M", "B002LVVCJY", "B00008WI9N", "B0014GI6I2", "B00112S8RS", "B00005BCK9", "B0047T74CM", "B00AEBB8LA", "6305803765", "B002WNU0QW", "B00000IC7G", "B000E33VWW", "6305313687", "B0000BXMZ8", "B008220DGE", "B0013XZ2QK", "B001P3SA8K", "B004SIP71M", "B00320J6WS", "B0006GW2JU", "B00002RAO2", "B00AQBDU4Q", "B000GDH9NM", "B00AEFXE9U", "B00000G02H", "B00AEBB8SS", "B00AQTY3JO", "B00003CWTI", "B000PAAJZ6", "6305781095", "B000K7VHQ4", "B00562D3Y2", "B0001CNRRU", "0452282950", "B000NOIX48", "B00008YJDK", "B0060ZJ7DA", "630514415X", "B000GFLKF8", "B001MZ5W46", "B002QFYJF4", "B004SIP73U", "B001P3SA8A", "B0009W5IMO", "B001LLH8SO", "B00005JMW7", "B00005JLKN", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00AEFXE3Q", "B003BV8I3Q", "B00005JLRE", "B008NNY8SQ", "B001BP4K22", "B00390560M", "B0060ZJ7AI", "B0024EWP6W", "0783226845", "B00005V9HH", "B002LVVCK8", "B000J10F14", "0783230443", "B000R4SMCW", "B000YENUI6", "B00979KQ4U", "B00AEBBA4K", "B000KX0IOK", "B000HRMAPE", "B00320JAXS", "B0001907AI", "B001N44BVQ", "B00005A1TJ", "B000XJD34S", "B000ZS8GWQ", "B000286RP2", "B00003CXWV", "B000KX0IM2", "B0034G4OSG", "B00HOGBXS6", "B008220DIC", "B00006RCNV", "B003CJXIOG", "0767830555", "B000E40QC4", "B00006CXI1", "0786707720", "B000M341SC", "B0018BD9DA", "B004U7MR14", "B00H9KKKAY", "B00112S8S2", "B004SIP7VM", "B00AEFXEN6", "B00000F7E6", "B00005UQ9T", "B00011CZRE", "B00AEBBA5E", "B00GUO2SKA", "B00102F5WK", "B001O7JHSE"], "bought_together": ["B0014GI6I2", "B000E33VWW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["6305313687", "B000K7VHQ4", "B00AEBB8LA", "0452282950"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 12242}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.5, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B00008K7AO", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51G2DT6QWQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "25th Hour"}

{"description": "Conspiracies abound inChildren of Dune, Sci-Fi Channel's praiseworthy miniseries sequel toFrank Herbert's Dune, loyally adapted from the Herbert novelsDune MessiahandChildren of Duneby John Harrison, who passed directorial duties (due to a scheduling conflict) to Greg Yaitanes, a 31-year-old TV director andDuneneophyte tackling his biggest assignment to date. Uninitiated viewers face a disadvantage; it's best to readHerbert's booksand/or see the first miniseries before plunging into this remarkably coherent tangle of political intrigue, unfolding 12 years after the events ofDune.To his horror, Maud'Dib--Arrakis emperor Paul Atreides (Alec Newman, reprising hisDunerole)--has become the unintended figurehead of a violent dictatorship, and his enemies are multiplying. Vanishing into the desert, he waits as destiny shapes his twin heirs Leto II (James McAvoy) and Ghanima (Jessica Brooks), who must contend with their scheming aunt Alia (Daniela Amavia) while Princess Wensicia (Susan Sarandon), of the enemy House Corrino, plots her own attack on Maud'Dib's familial empire. Exiled Atreides matriarch Lady Jessica (Alice Krige, giving the film's finest performance) returns to Arrakis, where the enormous, desert-dwelling sandworms face an uncertain future. As always, the spice must flow, and the universe's most coveted commodity remains at the center of this richly detailed and physically impressive production. Special effects range from awesome (fly-over shots of the capital city, Arakeen) to awful (the saber-tooth tigers look likeJumanjirejects), andDunedevotees will endlessly debate the miniseries' strengths and weaknesses. Some may desire more action to punctuate the film's inherent verbosity, but consensus will surely conclude that this isDunedone right, with monumental effort and obvious devotion from everyone involved.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000639EV", "0783226063", "B00371QQ0M", "0441328008", "0441294677", "0441104029", "076535148X", "0441102670", "0765351498", "0765362619", "0425068137", "0441172695", "B00008NGHU", "B00K2CHWYI", "0553580302", "0765351501", "0765362627", "0553580337", "0441966918", "B00J5LXMTG", "B006JN87WK", "B00077BPA0", "0553580272", "1847374255", "076534078X", "B00EQ2KVQQ", "0765322749", "0441172717", "B00005JNV9", "0765340798", "B008R65XN8", "0765353709", "B00B04NIZO", "B0002Y4TWE", "B002ZG99EK", "B000056WR3", "B000ATQYXI", "B003XURDAY", "B000B8I9XQ", "B002KPINY8", "0765340771", "B000001ZD2", "B00HWWUQYY", "B00CBFB8OE", "B0039PGH9G", "B00D3DJIG8", "0765301571", "B0045HCJ9O", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B002436WFI", "B00K7IPGS6", "B004EXWGHY", "B008JFUNHI", "B000BCCAEQ", "B00005QAPI", "B0006IIPIK", "B0006FO9B0", "B0010X744G", "B000E5N6B6", "B000VSDNFA", "B00005JM39", "B008M4MB8K", "B000JLTRHW", "1574925628", "B00JBGWP3Y", "B00JLDTB2U", "B00363WGB4", "B00003CXCT", "B008R52LA2", "B002I9Z8GW", "B008JFUNJQ", "B0050MB5KM", "B0019BI1DM", "B006MFQ4OS", "B002WNU0QM", "B002QW7ALM", "B000OY9VFW", "B005LAIHXQ", "B00C8CQTJY", "B00GX7D5G0", "B00E8S2JZ4", "B00JQYUV9Q", "B0007P0Y7C", "B00366F2NU", "B0009JE6G6", "B0000VCZK2", "0783225903", "B000062XF2", "B00A04YHI2", "B00HERGM86", "B001TH16DI", "B00A2H9OZS", "B003BV8I7C", "B001KOFH2G", "B001CEE1YE", "B000WTZ6SK", "B000BW7QWW", "B00H83EV5W", "B004HZY8OS", "B0029778T8"], "bought_together": ["0783226063"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0000639EV", "0783226063", "B00FP20ZCG", "0441172717"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 19117}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 89.99, "brand": "IVE", "asin": "B00008RUYH", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DQ3EJGD5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Frank Herbert's Children of Dune: Sci-Fi TV Miniseries (Two-Disc DVD Set)"}

{"description": "Because of the intense political nature ofTears of the Sun, it's no surprise that a good deal of the DVD content is devoted to the political and historical background of Africa.  Director Antoine Fuqua discusses it in his feature-length commentary track, along with other comments about the film itself.  Another commentary track, in which the authors recall the making of the film and the material that was cut, lasts 17 minutes and is not related to the portion of the film it accompanies.  A pop-up \"fact track\" offers further background and production info, as does a 15-minute making-of featurette.  Eight of the African actors discuss their harrowing personal experiences in \"Voices of Africa,\" and eight deleted scenes wouldn't have added much to the film, other than introducing two small but important characters earlier.

{"description": "Though it bears little resemblance to the original 1969 thriller starring Michael Caine, the 2003 remake ofThe Italian Jobstands on its own as a caper comedy that's well above average. The title's a misnomer--this time it's actually a Los Angeles job--but the action's just as exciting as it propels a breezy tale of honor and dishonor among competing thieves. Inheriting Caine's role as ace heist-planner Charlie Croker, Mark Wahlberg plays straight-man to a well-cast team of accomplices, including Mos Def, Jason Statham, and scene-stealer Seth Green in a variation of the role originally played by Noel Coward. As the daughter of Croker's ill-fated mentor (Donald Sutherland), Charlize Theron is recruited to double-cross a double-crosser (Edward Norton in oily villain mode), and once again, speedily versatile Mini Coopers play a pivotal role in director F.

While it lacks the thematic impact of Eastwood's masterpiece, Costner's first film since 1997's ill-fatedThe Postmanreturns the actor/director ofDances With Wolvesto the open prairies of America--in this case the free-range frontier of 1882--where legal \"free-grazing\" cattle drives were falling prey to empire-building land-owners. In the wake of territorial murder, free-grazing cowboys Boss (Robert Duvall) and Charley (Costner) seek vengeful justice against the ruthless rancher (Michael Gambon) who threatens their law-abiding survival. A feisty ally (the late Michael Jeter, in his next-to-final film role) and a doctor's sister (Annette Bening) offer support during climactic shootouts, masterfully staged with the shock and suddenness of real-life gunfire. Rich in character development and thick-hided humor, this handsome production redeemed Costner's directorial career with a well-told story (by Craig Storper, based on Lauran Paine's novelThe Open Range Men), flawless performances, and stunning Canadian locations.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000GFRI4K", "B0018PH3L0", "B000E5N6LG", "6304711905", "B001LRJH0U", "B004AOECXI", "B00116GEJS", "B0038EGD3I", "B00DZUV0M4", "B000XR9L50", "B003AWRMCE", "B00368PSKK", "B001LMAK88", "6305504024", "B00368PSKU", "B003NF97MQ", "B00005LOL0", "B003ASLJRC", "B00007G78A", "B002LII6PU", "B00AEBBA0E", "B001VC99HQ", "B003ASLJS6", "B003AWRM9M", "B003UESJME", "B002O3Z4XE", "B000BITVBA", "0767817710", "B000056H2J", "B00008IHAW", "B000059H7K", "B00005JMOW", "B0081FSMPG", "B0000YTP02", "B0045HCJTO", "B000EOTUSK", "B000W1SZBS", "B00CQ9VEDK", "B00008CMR4", "B001R0AY9Y", "B0007OY2OO", "078324021X", "0783228007", "B00AEFYSEA", "B0016OLXN2", "B00004WG2F", "B001KO1BCQ", "B00B83ROIE", "B00AEFYPHA", "B0018RWMNM", "B00A92MF6Q", "B004AOECTC", "B00002SSKG", "B00006AUHQ", "B00AEBBA36", "B00AEBB932", "B0035JHYJI", "B00004XPPG", "B009INAI02", "B002U4UYYQ", "0792839056", "B000KF0GWW", "0783229631", "B00001ZWUS", "B00007ELF1", "B00AMDA2OY", "B0006HBZXS", "B000NOIVT0", "B0007TKNM4", "B000A2WP7O", "B000A2WAQU", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00000K0DM", "B000O599Y4", "B001PO55AA", "B00005JNP4", "B000O599YE", "B00005JLV5", "B004KDYQYY", "B003Q7B6ZC", "B000P0J0EM", "B000ANVPP6", "B000O599WQ", "B001B187MU", "B007Y1NR1W", "B000059TFW", "B002O3Z510", "B00005JKZH", "B000P0J0EW", "6304698747", "B0045HCJSK", "B00AEBB8YM", "B00005JN0W", "B00IO03I6Q", "0792844874", "B000GIW9I2", "B0068FZ0O2", "078322592X", "B0006N2EZ0", "0783225725"], "bought_together": ["B000GFRI4K", "B0018PH3L0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0018PH3L0", "6304711905", "B004AOECXI", "B001LMAK88"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 3051}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.99, "brand": "Touchstone Video", "asin": "B0000TANUI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5166e3Ia3aL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Open Range"}
{"description": "Claude Lelouch may never be the most profound director in the world, but he sure knows how to whip up a catchy distraction.And Now Ladies & Gentlemenfinds Lelouch in a skippy, unpredictable mode. Jeremy Irons, who seems to be enjoying himself enormously, is a thief who sets out on a sailing voyage, only to fetch up in Morocco after he blacks out at the helm. There he meets sultry singerPatricia Kaas(her first acting role); it turns out they both might have brain tumors. Did someone say this is a romantic comedy? It is, complete with musical numbers (Kaas glides through a cozy cross-section of French pop music, including the theme fromA Man and a Woman, Lelouch's '60s smash). The movie's all over the place, and it spins its wheels for the final half-hour, but there are certain kinds of romantics who will find this sort of thing irresistible.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00009V7RV", "B003M0I9EE", "B00FF9SKQW", "B000092T3H", "B0030T120A", "B005ZVIPG0", "B00366F2NU", "B00BTYXNPK", "B000BGQUH0", "B000056BP3", "B0000UJL82", "B000EOTW3I", "B00009YXEN", "B0007G89FK", "B009KZMFOA", "B00GMV8L1Q", "B002UOOMP8", "B0007WRT4Q", "B0010SAGHS", "B00004U2K1", "B002SV3KN8", "B00092ZKZ4", "B007UW9WMS", "B00070HK24", "B001TK80CU", "B005CFBZ3O", "B0009298N4", "B00005JPX8", "B000ERVJQ8", "B001L57ZZG", "B00003CY6A", "B00005BCKG", "B005KBEHIU", "B005FITIGO", "B000254IEW", "B001J0FVY0", "B00000298J", "B00079ZA68", "B001QMGENS", "B0009A404I", "B005ETALGK"], "bought_together": ["B00009V7RV", "B000092T3H"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005ZVIPG0", "B00366F2NU", "B003M0I9EE", "B000092T3H"]}, "price": 59.89, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 151552}, "asin": "B0000UJLF0", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HGBTV4W4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "And Now Ladies &amp; Gentlemen"}

The first segment of the four-part, 54-minute documentary is mostly self-congratulation and plot summary (which is not necessarily a bad thing); more interesting are the creature effects and the actors learning how to do their own stunts.  If you were wondering if the voice of the Lycan Raze was really that deep, you can listen to him--actor/co-writer Kevin Grevioux--along with director Len Wiseman and co-writer Danny McBride on the first commentary track as they discuss breaking the rulebook for vampires and shooting in Budapest on a tiny $22 million budget.

{"description": "Based on the bestseller by John Grisham,Runaway Juryis a slick thriller that's exciting enough to overcome the gaps in its plot. The ultimate target has been changed: Grisham's legal assault on the tobacco industry was switched to the hot-button issue of gun control (no doubt to avoid comparison toThe Insider) in a riveting expos&#xE9; of jury-tampering. Gene Hackman plays the ultra-cynical, utterly unscrupulous pawn of the gun-makers, using an expert staff and advanced electronics to hand-pick a New Orleans jury that will return a favorable verdict; Dustin Hoffman (making his first screen appearance with real-life former roommate Hackman) defends the grieving widow of a gun-shooting victim with idealistic zeal, while maverick juror John Cusack and accomplice Rachel Weisz play both ends against the middle in a personal quest to hold gun-makers accountable. It's riveting stuff, even when it's obvious that Grisham and director Gary Fleder have glossed over any details that would unravel the plot's intricate design.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783226942", "B000P5FH3K", "B002NZK5R8", "B00AEFXYJA", "B002NZK5UU", "0767810872", "B002NZK5VO", "B0000694XY", "630542828X", "B00AEFXT1S", "B0006HBZBA", "B0045HCJ8K", "B0000C3I8M", "B004EPYZP8", "B0010YSD7W", "B00096S49Y", "B000063US3", "B000R4SMCW", "1558908382", "B001NY4WYC", "B003ASLJIQ", "6305428115", "B00005B6JZ", "B00005JL8F", "B00005UQ9T", "B00008EY9G", "B00008K77D", "0800141806", "B00005JPT0", "B00003CXFV", "B000P0I4O4", "B000CEV3M8", "B00441GYPG", "0790732149", "B000SFOW8I", "B000TJ6PBK", "0783240295", "B001I2EQUY", "B000055Y0Y", "B000NTMA0Q", "B002O3Z4ZW", "B002AT8KAG", "0790730979", "B00003CY5G", "B0038Z5T4Q", "B004SIP9RO", "B004YCKKFK", "B002AS464Q", "B00AMSM9DG", "0783226888", "B00AADAK5W", "B0031OCY2E", "B002DU39GW", "B00000K3TU", "B002LMV7R0", "B0013D8LBS", "B000GFLKF8", "B000CEXEWA", "B00008L3S6", "B00005ATZT", "B00AEBB9UK", "6304806434", "B002AT8K9W", "B00AEFXEGS", "B003ASLJQ8", "B0043X1FNQ", "B000BNX3B4", "B001CC7PLM", "B002QW7AMG", "B000JYW5BE", "B000Y11B8U", "B001HVZOB6", "B00BLN4UKQ", "B005NKIPUY", "B00015YVDG", "B00H91LWDC", "0792844874", "6305657947", "B003L20IG0", "0780618548", "B00DWZHTOU", "B003Q6D2B4", "B000ENC5YW", "B00GUO2SKA", "B0010YVCB6", "B00009WVSL", "B000G5SILC", "B000F8DV1M", "B00FQRZ6EM", "B000OYAT3U", "B00AEFXIIW", "B008JFURII", "B00005JNQA", "B002O3Z4XY", "B000059XTK", "B00005JN5E", "B001ECDVK4", "B000K7VHQ4", "B00000JGHL"], "bought_together": ["B000P5FH3K", "0783226942"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001I2EQUY", "B000P5FH3K", "B00AEFXYJA", "B002NZK5VO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 38867}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.67, "brand": "Twentieth Century Fox", "asin": "B00014NEZI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51X52Z0CBSL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Runaway Jury (Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "The slippery protagonist ofThe Talented Mr. Ripleyreturns in another deadly guise inRipley's Game, a well-appointed star vehicle. The star this time is John Malkovich, whose older Tom Ripley has settled into an Italian villa and a life of aesthetic contemplation (a little like Hannibal Lecter inHannibal). A former partner (Ray Winstone) drags an innocent frame-maker (Dougray Scott), dying of leukemia, into the role of unexpected hit man. Ripley, for his own enigmatic reasons, helps. Liliana Cavani, ofThe Night Porternotoriety, directed this handsome if nebulous film (which has no connection to theMatt Damon picture, other than a Patricia Highsmithsource novel). Malkovich exudes his usual oily disenchantment with the world; Lena Headey, like the location footage, is gorgeous. The same novel was adapted in very different style by Wim Wenders for his brilliant 1977 film,The American Friend, with Dennis Hopper and Bruno Ganz.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEBB8SS", "B009D004TA", "B0035ECHJA", "0393332128", "0393332136", "039333211X", "0393333191", "0393332144", "0393321983", "B00006LPC6", "0375407928", "B00005BCKG", "B00000F7E6", "B00005UQ9T", "B00CT6EJEG", "B009D0050I", "B004ALIG4M", "B000PMGS7C", "B00007AJF8", "0393324559", "B00IOFDKL4", "B000QXDCLK", "B0000SXK0E", "B000069HZU", "B00094AS6I", "0393322440", "B00AQBDU4Q", "B00HOGBXS6", "B00008RV1F", "B00393SG56", "6304696515", "B0000AZT79", "B00005O5B8", "B00008RH3L", "B00005B6L0", "B00008K7AO", "B004NWPY20", "B000286RNE", "B00004REAG", "B000E33VWW", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B005KKVAHW", "B000PKG8TM", "B0000AGQ5V", "B00EF1PKX2", "B00112S8RS", "B0036TGSRG", "0767833600", "B000GIW9I2", "0871132907", "B00JAQJNN0", "B00005Y6XA", "B000EQHXNW", "B0009GX1CE", "B002GYKTZO", "B00CUKTHES", "B004P7CMUU", "B002O3Z4WU", "B00005AUJI", "B00009Y3PV", "B00441GYOM", "B00005JMVQ", "B00DUX290S", "B000065U1F", "B00D3LA5WG", "B001VPCINK", "B000006YEQ", "B005TZFZ5Q", "B001UFE8PM", "B00562D3Y2", "B00G9W7N6W", "B00005JKJA", "B0040J1RX6", "B0009VRHLK", "B007IUEEA2", "B00166UFA2", "B009UTX4M8", "B0059XTTW8", "B00003CWSX", "B0002V7SOS", "B00005BCK9", "B0016AKSOG", "B000NIVJFY", "B009OCR2U6", "B000E33W0I", "B0034G4P30", "B002LVVCJY", "B00DZP1C2W", "B001NFNFNU", "B0001LJCQQ", "B00BUWD76Q", "B009POCG0Y", "B000S6UZTC", "B000063K2Q", "B0013XZ2QK", "B002ZG993Q", "B00BLF9FYA", "B000E6ESXK", "B000H6SXYM", "B0001EFV7C"], "bought_together": ["B00AEBB8SS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0792165020", "0393332136", "B009D004TA", "B00HV46PBG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 86425}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.49, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00018D40O", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51NBNWQRPNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Ripley's Game"}

{"description": "No actor works harder to open a movie than Tom Cruise. His enthusiasm is throughout the DVD extras as he mirrors his samurai character by constantly talking about \"loyalty\" and \"discipline\" while working on the film. However as a post-movie experience, the top-line extras with Cruise and director Edward Zwick are repetitive and underwhelming, with too many clips from the film we assume DVD viewers have just seen. The History Channel show is also a pre-release promotional device that misses an opportunity to really dig into this intriguing time period. Better are segments on the costumes, the production design, and how you put together an Imperial army--in New Zealand, no less. Zwick's low-key and dense commentary (plus a \"Video Journal\") is not vital, but he illustrates many of the little peculiarities it took to make the wide-ranging film come together. There are two deleted scenes; a samurai's first appearance is particularly memorable.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEFY5B6", "B002O3Z50Q", "B00004XPPG", "B00AMSLDTM", "B0002YLCG0", "B0000DZTIW", "B000AARKOO", "B000QXDED6", "B003U0AHBO", "B00AEFXKUI", "B000A2WP7O", "B008MIMWOY", "B00AEBBA36", "B004AOECXI", "6305692688", "B000MGB6NM", "B0000TANUI", "079283366X", "B00005JL78", "B000W1SZBS", "B004SIP88Y", "B0034G4P58", "B001TUZG4K", "B00AS1Q93S", "B000MRA592", "B00001ZWUS", "B000E5N6LG", "B000XR9L50", "B0001HLVS2", "B00HEPDGKA", "B003ASLJO0", "B00AEBB9NM", "B000P0J0EW", "B0000A2ZNX", "B00005JNTI", "B0018QPPXW", "B000065U1N", "B000095WW8", "B0002WZTOI", "B002VWNIEA", "B004U7MQWY", "B002VWNID6", "B008JFUO36", "B00AEBB86A", "B00005JN0W", "B0007Q6VXC", "B001LRJH0U", "B000MZHW40", "B0002IQMAM", "B00004WG2F", "B003INBO3I", "B000EHRVMY", "B000NOKFHQ", "B000P0J0EM", "B00AEFXVCU", "B000YENUI6", "B000M341QE", "B0000YEEGM", "B001680M26", "B008R65XYC", "B002ZG99QS", "B00008K76U", "B000HRMAPE", "B007TBKAXK", "B00000G3PA", "0767810856", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B00AEFXYJA", "B002T9H2LA", "B000P0J0AG", "B00003CXZ1", "B000O599YO", "B000FS9FCG", "6304711905", "B00AEFXRRO", "B000HRMAUY", "B001ILHY1I", "B002NZK5V4", "B002VWNICC", "B000VKL6ZM", "B001UDS4BS", "B002ZG997C", "B004SIP8ZM", "0800177967", "B0001O3YD0", "B00005ATZT", "B004XFZ3UU", "B00004Z4WR", "B005LAIH2W", "B0007TKNGA", "B00000JQB5", "B0012Q732O", "B002ZG97RE", "B0002VEUV2", "0800141741", "B002ZG977Y", "B00005N5S3", "B00008G8M4", "B0000B1OFL"], "bought_together": ["B00AEFY5B6", "B00004XPPG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000QXDED6", "B00BEJL6JK", "B00AEFXXMI", "B00JU949TK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 121880}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 17.25, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B0001JXOUS", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51EdSWs9r9L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Last Samurai (Full Screen Edition)"}

{"description": "\"In your satin tights / Fighting for your rights / And the old Red, White, and Blue!... / Wonder Woman!\" Could anyone who grew up in the '70s ever forget that super-catchy theme song? Originally packaged as the female version of theBatmanTV show (producer Stanley Ralph Ross penned 32 of the caped crusader's episodes),Wonder Womanended up redefining the campy, comic book genre. The primetime show immediately became a social and cultural phenomenon, attracting a wide audience that continued to tune in to America's favorite socially progressive superheroine.Looking back on it now, it is easy to see the attraction of this unique show that oozed '70s culture, but was set in the 1940s. While trying to stop a Nazi plane from reaching the U.S., Major Steve Trevor (Lyle Waggoner) is shot down, landing on mythical Paradise Island.  The uncharted island is the hidden home to the lost tribe of eternally young Amazon women. The Amazons take in the Major and nurse him back to health. During his recovery he attracts the sympathy and interest of Princess Diana (Lynda Carter, former Miss USA 1973) who is intrigued by the man from the mainland and his tales of the evil Nazis.  She decides she must follow the Major back to the U.S. and join the forces of good against the tyranny of evil.  So begins the saga of the beautiful Amazon Wonder Woman, armed with super strength, bulletproof bracelets, and the unbreakable, \"truth-telling,\" golden lasso. What sets season 1 apart from the two subsequent seasons is that the pilot and each of the 13 episodes take place during World War II, corresponding to the original comic stories.  In this season we see Wonder Woman battle spies, uncover Fausta the Nazi Wonder Woman, stop thieves trying to steal the secret substance of Amazonian power (Feminum), wrestle a Nazi-trained circus gorilla, and rescue an interplanetary visitor held captive by the Third Reich--all of which are priceless.Included with the pilot episode is an extremely fun commentary track by Lynda Carter and producer Douglas C. Kramer. Also added on the DVD set is the making-of featurette \"Beauty, Brawn and Bulletproof Bracelets.\"  Yes, it is very campy, cheesy, dated, and filled with double entendres and subtle innuendos. But below the surface, there is something special that makes the show timeless and a pleasure to watch. CallingWonder Woman: The Complete First Seasona time capsule would be an understatement. But a time capsule in the most wonderful sense of the phrase.--Rob Bracco", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0006Z2KZ2", "B00080ZG2E", "B003W5C0TY", "B0055CP9MC", "B005LFQRTC", "B00LT1JHLW", "B004M9ZI0C", "B005EVY8NA", "B00008WJEZ", "B00AKK6LM6", "B001LK8SQ6", "0061885177", "B004EXWGJW", "B000FDDYPA", "B0002MHDW4", "B0049CSDRW", "B0049IHWYG", "B000PFUANC", "B008OR5X6M", "B009M4KT3I", "B000GJIU3E", "B008H6GHII", "B00AA8Q0JM", "B000A5046K", "B00005LOUK", "B004ULEENE", "B001ECDVGS", "B000ION23U", "B000TSTEMS", "B000W2C28Y", "B00GX7D5JW", "B00L9SXSCE", "B00DYQ1GBE", "B0027WNRV8", "B007HMCEMQ", "B00009ATIM", "B0028RABR0", "B005G5NPD8", "B0007YMWFK", "B001675Z2E", "B003FYCTYI", "B000B8IA3U", "B00B3LXKZW", "B004S3LY6Y", "B00HMOW9YM", "B0006IUDXA", "B000Z6GT18", "B000SMNL92", "B00803LRK6", "B000OPODNQ", "B000BT96EG", "B000ASDFIG", "B002S3Y1LQ", "B003VTZ72I", "B009ZQBLR6", "B00IP78OBW", "B007I454G6", "B000FDFSH2", "B00005JNHU", "B00GOC74RU", "B000OPODNG", "B00BBXSPES", "B001SZEYPI", "B00595W3Q0", "B0009UC80G", "B001J0FVYK", "B0001BS3IE", "B00125WAY6", "B000BB1MJ6", "B000BUE5D2", "B00DXLO0D6", "B004N93D5S", "B000BF0C8E", "B00466X70Y", "B0024FAD7Y", "B003F3NE4S", "B001SGN1JM", "B00DXLO086", "B00AZ6LZL2", "B0009B16TY", "B00197POWC", "B002L5GQ0K", "B004E83KVU", "B006LG74Q0", "B000MQ4WN8", "B0007XFZMS", "B000BT96FA", "B00080ZG2O", "B0018BDDFE", "B00005JO3P", "B0030Y12AK", "B00541NO4E", "B00BBXSPCK", "B00746R3LM", "B00HUPC5QU", "B001DF681G", "B0009I7NGW", "B000IONJI8"], "bought_together": ["B0006Z2KZ2", "B00080ZG2E"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000X07SQ6", "B00080ZG2E", "B0006Z2KZ2", "B004M9ZI0C"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 25552}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 25.17, "brand": "WEA", "asin": "B0001ZMWYG", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/619Y0D3HDBL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Wonder Woman: Season 1"}

{"description": "The further adventures of King Company's second platoon are highlighted in all their blazing action and dramatic impact in this four-disc set, which concludesCombat!'s 1962-63 debut season. King Two undergoes a few changes in episodes 17 through 32--Shecky Greene's Pvt. Braddock is absent from the platoon (Greene quit over pay issues) and Jack Hogan, whose Pvt. Kirby first appeared in \"The Forgotten Front\" (featured in theCombat! Season One: Campaign Oneboxed set) is now a featured cast member; Emmy nominee Conlon Carter, who would later join the cast as Doc in the third season, appears as an unnamed PVC in disc 3's \"Hill 256.\" The 17 episodes featured here carry the men of King Two to the liberation of Paris, which concludes the season; afterwards, the series would no longer adhere to true chronological events, preferring instead to place the men in mostly unspecific dates and locations within France. The excellent performances of the main cast, led by Vic Morrow and Rick Jason, are well abetted by terrific guest stars, including Robert Culp, Dean Stockwell, and even futureIlsa: She-Wolf of the SSdirector Don Edmonds, and direction by Golden Age TV vets such as Robert Altman, Ted Post, and Richard Donner.The interview featurette \"Memories ofCombat!\" that was featured on theCampaign Oneboxed set is absent fromCampaign Two, as is episode commentary by Robert Altman and the production photo gallery, but this set features more commentary tracks from cast and crew members. Actor Tom Lowell (Pvt. Billy Nelson) again contributes a track, as do guest stars Joseph Campanella and Ben Cooper and directors Ted Post, Richard Donner, and Sutton Roley. Also returning is Jo Davidsmeyer, author ofCombat! A Viewer's Guide to the WWII TV Series, who lists production trivia and continuity bloopers in the scene selection menu for each episode.

{"description": "Declared \"luminously beautiful\" by the New York Times, Andrey Zvyagintsev's The Return is a stunning mixture of visionary allegory, urgent suspense and road movie momentum. Zvyagintsev's equal skill with lush visuals, lucid storytelling and breathtaking realism easily netted The Return the prestigious Golden Lion and the Best First Feature Film Award at the Venice International Film Festival.  Within the emotional vacuum of a fatherless childhood, young brothers Andrei (Vladimir Garin) and Ivan (Ivan Dobronravov) have grown closer than most siblings. But when they least expect it, the father the boys have never known returns. Under the cool midnight sun of a coastal Russian summer, Andrei and Ivan eagerly hop into a car for a week long fishing trip with a complete stranger they desperately need to believe is their father. but as they travel deeper into the Russian wilderness, their journey devolves from vacation to boot camp to father-sons love triangle and ultimately to a test of wills that pushes to the brink of violence. As it dawns on the boys that the man who could be their father might be trying to abandon, exploit or kill them, The Return's Jungian landscape gives way to fervid Freudian rage, shocking loss and bittersweet redemption.  Harried as one of the most auspicious film debuts since Badlands or The 400 Blows, The Return is both a gorgeous contemporary thriller and an astute updating of vanguard Soviet filmmaking. Disturbing, tender, transcendent, The Return's skillful marriage of psychological complexity to mythic imagery effortlessly evokes the watershed films of Andrei Tarkovsky and Roman Polanski.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000K2UEDG", "B00280QNK6", "B00019G4TQ", "B000RTCSIQ", "B000LTTOOS", "B004XVMCLC", "B0000633SD", "B00008ZZ9M", "B00006LPEK", "B0022RVO18", "B008MZTKFG", "B003OXGW5M", "B0000DGKI7", "B00009MEKP", "B000LV6OHQ", "B003VWR1XI", "B00003CXF4", "B0000633SB", "B00006JO77", "B000NQRDZG", "B00005QFE6", "6305257450", "B002BWP4A6", "B000I8OOG0", "6305744114", "B0000BWVCR", "B002QP145C", "B001MPS7GG", "B001PCNZEU", "B000B58DIA", "B0087OULO6", "B003MTAZCO", "B00HVOFP6W", "B006ML50YC", "B006IW8E3Y", "B004VH65A2", "B00009NHAT", "B000WS6YAA", "B0000ALPJ2", "B001UE49BQ", "B000EANSXM", "B00GMV8B1G", "B001H30Q08", "B000OVLBGC", "B00H0EN948", "B0001LJCAW", "B00019G4RS", "B000TGCR38", "B00006LPEH", "B001QOZYRS", "B000I8OOHE", "B000OCY7JE", "B0000C2IQA", "B000K7VHQO", "B00HRJVHEK", "B000PKG6OO", "B00151QYE4", "B0036TGSJE", "B002U4F5W2", "B00GA9F2PI", "B007FEHA0C", "B00IGK6TH4", "B0016K3988", "B000V7HFL4", "B00023P4N8", "B00AXYZZ6C", "B0002DB52M", "6305131104", "B00006LPER", "B00031TYGW", "B000EHQU30", "B009XTF8NI", "B000FZEU0G", "B0000YEDM2", "B001CW7ZT4", "B009CSVQ8Q", "B006ML50S8", "B0048FQFFM", "B0019T0JAW", "B004SIP6GI", "B00GPPXNLC", "B004GNBBVO", "B00EO2I6S8", "5489003219", "B000A5044C", "B00A8QDI1Y", "B00005N8A9", "B00H91LWBY", "B0000714AW", "B00065GX0K", "6305899681", "B005LAIIIK", "B000BC8SWE", "B00000F3CD", "B002U1LGSW", "B0000DJYNI", "B000G0O5IM", "B00005JLQW", "B000BMY2NS", "B004G8QO7U"], "bought_together": ["B00280QNK6", "B000K2UEDG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000RTCSIQ", "B000K2UEDG", "B000LTTOOS", "B00280QNK6"]}, "price": 18.46, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 82114}, "asin": "B0002KQOH6", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51BBQQ48J2L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Return"}

Al-Jazeera's determination to show images and report details outside the Pentagon's carefully controlled information flow draws the wrath of American officials, who accuse it of being an al-Qaida propagandist. (The killing of an Al-Jazeera reporter in what appears to be a deliberately targeted air strike is horrifying.)

{"description": "Audiences were captivated by the women of Wisteria Lane in the first season ofDesperate Housewives, the breakout hit from ABC that almost single-handedly lifted the network from its ratings doldrums and brought back the classic TV soap, remixed now with satire, comedy, and mystery. An affectionate yet darkly tinged send-up of suburbia that skirtedTwin Peaksterritory as much as that ofKnots Landing,Desperate Housewivesopened with a bang--literally--as perfect-seeming housewife Mary Alice Young (Brenda Strong) went through her picture-perfect day before putting a handgun to her temple and pulling the trigger. Mary Alice's sudden suicide leaves her four closest friends, all housewives of a sort, with a surfeit of grief, a re-examination of their own lives, and a mystery to solve. It also proves to be a catalyst for a seamy study of what goes on inside the finely appointed homes of Wisteria Lane--the tales of which Mary Alice narrates from beyond the grave with a sardonic tone dipped in both honey and arsenic.There's Martha Stewart-perfect Bree (Marcia Cross), who rules her household with an iron fist in a tailor-made garden glove and seems to have it all, until she finds out her husband (Steven Culp) is cheating on her--and had a serious fetish habit to boot. Sultry Gaby (Eva Longoria), the youngest of the set, is a bored trophy wife whose predilection for shopping and clothes are the perfect decoy for her affair with the hunky teenage gardener (Jesse Metcalfe). Former career woman Lynette (Felicity Huffman) is the most stereotypical housewife, raising four (or was it five?) kids and frustrated at using her cutthroat business skills for suburban politics. And daffy Susan (Teri Hatcher), the divorcee looking for love, sees her prospects brighten with the arrival of hunky plumber Mike (James Denton), who has some desperate secrets of his own. And did we mention the neighborhood hussy (Nicollette Sheridan), the snotty busybody (Christine Estabrook), and Mary Alice's increasingly agitated son (Cody Kasch)?It was a fast and wild mix of plot and characters that gaveDesperate Housewivesthe zing that made it a number one hit, as it never got too bogged down in any dilemma before moving on to the next. And though it was neither as hard-hitting nor salacious as it was trumpeted to be, the show nevertheless breathed fresh, funny air into comedy television, for even though it hewed to the hour-long soap format, the content was far more dark comedy than sudsy drama. There were fun bright spots to be had, but the story behind Mary Alice's death--which included drugs, murder, blackmail, secret identities, and vengeance in equal amounts--hovered over all the characters, tingeing the farce with the specter of danger. The show's other source of strength is in its peerless ensemble cast, headed by four perfect leading ladies, all Emmy-worthy. Hatcher received the (deserved) lion's share of praise (and a Golden Globe), but her co-stars--especially the underrated Longoria--matched her scene for scene. And though the mystery of Mary Alice's death was ultimately solved (noTwin Peaksteasing here), it was just the beginning of the troubles on Wisteria Lane, where no life went unexamined for too long.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000FIMG4U", "B000P6YNTI", "B0018CWEYO", "B001VPJYZK", "B003F3NDP8", "B003Y5HWGI", "B005Z28M58", "B0018CWEVW", "B00005JPII", "B000R7HRRA", "B003F3NE7K", "B0018CWEXA", "B00005JO9J", "B0001O3YLM", "B0018CWEZI", "B001VPJYZU", "B003L77G56", "B001VPJZ0E", "B003R0MEXQ", "B00G4RCNG2", "B003F3NDW6", "B0009IW88K", "B00684J49K", "B000P6YNSO", "B001L1S1SK", "B000FIMG5Y", "B000FUTVLO", "B000Q6GUKW", "B0077PTWX2", "B00166UFSY", "B0018CWEXK", "B000FFJYE8", "B003F3NDOE", "B00005JNEQ", "B00005JNOG", "B000AJJNI6", "B001VPJZ0O", "B003F3NE1Q", "B000TGURZ8", "B00369ERC4", "B0006IUE16", "B0002234R2", "B001MVWRNO", "B000CCBCGM", "B000GPIPTM", "B000QDLSR0", "B0002V7TZQ", "B000FUTVPA", "B001QE99AQ", "B002AMVED8", "1401302777", "B000EBGFPY", "B00684J49U", "B000GG4Y6O", "B003L77GEM", "B00004RFCM", "B000FVQLIO", "B000B5XOW0", "B001MVWRNE", "B000957O8C", "B00FR23PDU", "B00JF5GAZA", "B0000E5NPY", "B009RX7WTI", "B003R0MEW2", "B0009W5J4Q", "B001AQBGM4", "B0008JIJ1A", "B000H7JCGE", "B00382S9SW", "B001G0MFD8", "B000Q6GUW0", "B00AYVDUPW", "B0009CTVLS", "B000JLTRIG", "B009RX8GSE", "B001MVWRN4", "B001934SNM", "B004YM6JQO", "B000FIMG68", "B00382S9U0", "B0077PTWY6", "B002BAW6HW", "B0001IN0T4", "B0009K7QZ8", "B0009A407A", "B000NOKFGW", "B00JQF7ZR6", "B003L77GTC", "B0002MPQRS", "B00382S9UA", "B003FSTN4S", "B0081QF6Q8", "B0024FAD9C", "B000W6ZUUC", "B001B7CNZ6", "B000GTLQVW", "B0002RQ3MK", "B0077PTWHI"], "bought_together": ["B000FIMG4U", "B000P6YNTI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000FIMG4U", "B000P6YNTI", "B0018CWEYO", "B003F3NDP8"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 12745}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 12.84, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B00079FUI6", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51OX-la6a%2BL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Desperate Housewives - The Complete First Season"}

{"description": "The Reivers, based on a William Faulkner novel, is a spirited comedy-drama starring Steve McQueen in a rare character part as Boon Hoggenbeck, a ne'er-do-well, turn-of-the-century Mississippi farm hand and cousin of 11-year-old naif Lucius McCaslin (Mitch Vogel). The arrival of a handsome new automobile purchased by Lucius' grandfather, Boss McCaslin (a golden performance by Will Geer), causes an uproar when Boon and another cousin, Ned McCaslin (Rupert Crosse), who is half African American, vie to drive the vehicle around town. Boss's departure by train for a funeral gives Boon, Ned, and Lucius an opportunity to drive in style to Memphis, where young McCaslin's eyes are opened to a larger world of hard-core racism, prostitution, corruption, and the tyranny of the powerful over the vulnerable. In short order, Lucius finds his innate decency and integrity lessen the sting of disillusionment and helplessness. Director Mark Rydell (On Golden Pond) keeps things brisk and breezy, but never loses sight of the long shadow of adulthood that blots out Lucius' innocence.

{"description": "Will Smith's easygoing charm makesHitchthe kind of pleasant, uplifting romantic comedy that you could recommend to almost anyone--especially if there's romance in the air. As suave Manhattan dating consultant Alex \"Hitch\" Hitchens, Smith plays up the smoother, sophisticated side of his established screen persona as he mentors a pudgy accountant (Kevin James) on the lessons of love. The joke, of course, is that Hitch's own love life is a mess, and as he coaches James toward romance with a rich, powerful, and seemingly inaccessible beauty named Allegra (Amber Valetta), he's trying too hard to impress a savvy gossip columnist (Eva Mendes) with whom he's fallen in love. Through mistaken identities and mismatched couples, director Andy Tennant brings the same light touch that made Drew Barrymore'sEver Afterso effortlessly engaging. As romantic comedies go,Hitchdoesn't offer any big surprises, but as a date movie it gets the job done with amiable ease and style.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0009RCPUW", "B001QERPAC", "B0013J55B6", "B000N6U0E2", "B0001Z3TXE", "B00005JN0T", "B0013FDM7E", "B00AEFY99O", "B003Y5H4ZW", "B000VXWX7E", "B002K0WBXW", "B000803BQC", "B000BKVQS4", "B000HT386M", "B003Y5H574", "0800141741", "6305428115", "B00007E2F5", "B00005JMW7", "B00AEBB9WI", "B00008G8M4", "B002VECM6S", "B000LC3ICE", "B000ELJAEM", "B00003CXSM", "B004EPZ0BG", "B00AEBB8NS", "076780421X", "B00164KYV4", "B00AEFY0F2", "B003Y5H524", "B000VG66XS", "B00008WJD6", "B00AEFXWXI", "B002ZG998G", "B002ZG989G", "B000YDBPAM", "B000CEV3KU", "B00005JPE3", "B000AP04FG", "B00005JLQN", "B001C5LLQ4", "B00003CXO1", "B002P413IC", "B0001AVZA8", "B0012KJ0DK", "B0015I2RT8", "B000E6EHE0", "B001NPD9RM", "B00008VFCA", "B00006ZXSL", "B000FGGWGK", "B000098XQ8", "B001OQCUZM", "B000MQC9H4", "B00005JN3W", "B00005IBN0", "B003BV8ICC", "B00006FMUW", "B001SN78JO", "B000RBA6C4", "B0009UZGIM", "B001GKJ2E8", "B00005JNTU", "B000ZBEOEC", "B00AEFY4CG", "B0000B1OFL", "B008RNYMG0", "B0038N9WKU", "B0021L8UYY", "B000683VI4", "6304765266", "B000TZJBPQ", "B00005JLSB", "B0007PLLBU", "B000059TG6", "B002ZG9968", "B003EYVXXC", "B0000897EG", "B00005JM4Q", "B004IK30MI", "B00081U7HC", "B002ZG97B0", "B000P0J0EW", "B00005O5CM", "B005F2JRUC", "B000ASDFGI", "B00005JKCH", "B0006GAI5U", "B0000AKCKI", "B001UV4XRY", "B00005JMQW", "B0010X5X4O", "B000M341QE", "B001AKTZW8", "B00024JC4E", "B00AEBB8R4", "B00005JKMQ", "B00CLSBNNM", "B005LAII2Q"], "bought_together": ["B000N6U0E2", "B001QERPAC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000N6U0E2", "B002ZG97TW", "B002VECM6S", "B000AP04FG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 105544}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.94, "brand": "SMITH,WILL", "asin": "B000957O7S", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41jGu0AHCAL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Hitch (Fullscreen Edition)"}

{"description": "Despite the near-certainty of cancellation, ratings in the cellar and nothing left to lose, the fourth and final season ofStar Trek: Enterprisewas unanimously hailed as the best. After endingseason 3with a mind-boggling cliffhanger, series creators Rick Berman and Brannon Braga handed show-runner duties to executive producer Manny Coto, who rejuvenated the flagging franchise by bridging the gap betweenEnterpriseand the future developments ofStar Trek: The Original Series. By recruiting lifelongTrekexperts Mike Sussman and the husband-and-wife team of Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens to his writing staff, Coto ensured that political events in theEnterprisetimeline would lead to a \"coalition of planets,\" thus forming the Federation cornerstone ofStar Trek's future. But first, Coto had to find a way to extract Capt. Archer (Scott Bakula) and his battle-worn crew from an alternate timeline--the result of the continuing Temporal Cold War--in which the Nazis have invaded U.S. soil in 1944. In the normalEnterprisetimeline, political upheavals have left relations between Vulcans, Andorians, Tellarites, and Humans in a state of near-disastrous chaos.Into this blazing cauldron of action-adventure, Coto and staff introduced story arcs that connected toStar Trek's future, including a three-episode arc (\"Borderland,\" \"Cold Station 12,\" and \"The Augments\") in which Dr. Arik Soong (played byNext Generationalumnus Brent Spiner) and his superhuman \"Augments\" chart a tragic course that would lead, in future generations, to the creation of Spiner's cyberneticNextGencharacter, Data. \"The Forge,\" \"Awakening,\" and \"Kir'Shara\" returned T'Pol (Jolene Blalock) to her native Vulcan, where encounters with the legendary philosopher Surak, and zealous sect called the Syrannites, lead to pivotal history with the Vulcan High Command. In subsequent episodes, Phlox (John Billingsley) would discover the reason why some Klingons lack \"cranial ridges\" (thus solving a vexingStar Trekmystery), and \"In a Mirror, Darkly\" marked and eventful return to the \"Mirror Universe\" from the original series episode \"Mirror, Mirror,\" for what Coto aptly describes (in the bonus featurette) as a two-part \"romp,\" complete with a \"Mirror Universe\" title sequence, the reappearance of theU.S.S. Defiantfrom the original series episode \"The Tholian Web,\" and a glorious recreation of a \"Constitution Class\" starship bridge that gave long-time Trekkies a breathtaking rush of nostalgia.In the closing episodes, the formation of the Federation is threatened by a radical xenophobe (Peter Weller) whose isolationist tactics lead Trip (Connor Trinneer) and T'Pol to a future of interspecies parenthood, and while the series-ending \"These Are The Voyages...\" is considered a disappointment by some, it provided a suitableNext Generationtribute toStar Trek's past, present, and future. Considering the daunting challenge of tying up loose ends while looking forward in a way that demanding fans could appreciate, it's fair to say thatEnterprisereached a satisfying conclusion that its cast and crew can be proud of.DVD featuresIt's only fitting that Season 4's bonus features have a bittersweet quality, celebrating theStar Trekfranchise while acknowledging its uncertain future. For the first time on anyStar Trekseries, closure was imposed prematurely, and \"That's a Wrap\" (a video from theEnterprisewrap party at the Roosevelt Hotel in Hollywood) has the privileged feel of an emotional family reunion. (Unfortunately, Jolene Blalock and Connor Trinneer were unable to attend.) \"Inside the 'Mirror' Episodes\" offers a closer look at those enjoyably nostalgic episodes (\"we put the 'Ho' back in Hoshi\" jokes Mike Sussman about Linda Park's \"empress\" persona), and in \"Links to the Legacy,\" Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens explain how they broughtEnterprisecloser to its originalStar Trekheritage. \"Visual Effects Magic\" charts the astonishing advancements in digital effects since the comparatively crude effects ofNext Generation, and \"Enterprise Secrets\" reveals an affectionate assembly of behind-the-scenes personnel on the final day of shooting.  There's one final Easter egg (NX-01 File #10) about the ultimately futile \"SaveEnterprise\" fan protest against series cancellation (with appreciative comments by Scott Bakula and Connor Trinneer), and as always, the informative audio and text commentaries are fan-essential features loaded with detailed trivia and anecdotal history.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000A6CLL0", "B0009I7NGW", "B0007TKH66", "B00062IDCO", "B00062IDLA", "B0002WZTCA", "B0002JP4GE", "B00008KA57", "B000228EBS", "B0001NBNFW", "B00008KA59", "B00008KA5A", "B00005JLF5", "B00008972H", "B00008KGT0", "B00008KA58", "B000127LW2", "B00BHWG0CM", "B00BHWG0DQ", "B000063V8T", "B000063V8S", "B00062RCC6", "B00062IDDS", "B000063V8R", "B00005Y1NF", "B001DHXT3Y", "B000062XFG", "B000VDDDY6", "B0017VG69U", "B000RZIGVS", "B000HEWEJ4", "B0048FUUAI", "B00005JM3A", "B00KHA9BQ2", "B00K2CHUPY", "B0019N95IK", "B00IWTVDUW", "B00HT851LO", "B0011FLGZQ", "B00AZMFJYA", "B00BHWG1AI", "B007USBGSA", "B001DHXT6G", "B00K2CHWYI", "B004TJ1H3C", "B00BHWG0G8", "B000CQM4YM", "B004HYW84G", "B00HUPC5X8", "B00CYQXHLC", "B0007UDCX0", "B000HT3Q2I", "B00GTZWZH6", "1476706743", "B002EL4RLQ", "B00HCK7THS", "B000BNI90Y", "B000CCBCIA", "B00GX7D5G0", "B004EXWGHY", "B0017MO10U", "B001DW2BG0", "B00HNTOVX8", "B007USE5CE", "B000BR9SA0", "B003H9LIRK", "B0002NY81C", "B00BD6K54G", "B002I9Z8GM", "B003L77GUG", "B00402FGE4", "B00BUDDMGU", "B007XF0XVQ", "B005X4P3DC", "B003ZFC9M4", "B001RHGRTS", "B00061QJSK", "B000WTZ6SK", "B00F3L8P26", "B00CTSDDVO", "B000AJJNFE", "B0010YSD7M", "B00E3QJ7JC", "B002GP7ZVO", "B002VA5A02", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B0009JE6G6", "B005PPMHWE", "B002I9Z89Y", "B00466H3A4", "B0006FO9B0", "B00000ILBK", "B00GHH9HQ8", "B00DYQ1GBE", "B0000658PQ", "B002VA59ZS", "B004LWZW6K", "B0042YZFYG", "B00FFEM0W2", "B000F8O2PQ"], "bought_together": ["B000A6CLL0", "B0009I7NGW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000063V8U", "B000A6CLL0", "B0009I7NGW", "B0007TKH66"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 22610}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 40.79, "brand": "Paramount", "asin": "B000AOEMXC", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51FZA50YDNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Star Trek Enterprise - The Complete Fourth Season"}

This really was groundbreaking TV. \"I think you'll find there's a very simple explanation for all of this\", says schoolteacher Ian Chesterton (William Russell) condescendingly, shortly before being taken on board the TARDIS and transported to an alien planet. For audiences, too, this was something entirely unfamiliar, yet obviously appealing:Doctor Whoran for almost 30 years and remains one of the BBC's most popular shows. His later incarnations were all eccentric in their different ways, but William Hartnell's original Doctor is an irascible and distinctively alien character, not at all happy having to put up with ignorant 20th-century humans. The \"Unearthly Child\" of the title is his granddaughter Susan (Carole Ann Ford), temporarily attending school on Earth. She is conspicuously different from her classmates and attracts the attention of two of her teachers who resolve to find out why. After an encounter with her mysterious grandfather they are whisked away on an adventure to a different time and place where angry cavemen are trying in vain to learn the secret of fire. Thus the show's trademarks are established from the outset: the Doctor and his more or less reluctant human companions, the mechanical unreliability of the TARDIS, the cliffhanger ending of each episode. It was a formula that rarely changed but that allowed apparently limitless variation, the only constraint being the BBC's budget. In later years the show tried vainly to compete with blockbuster special effects movies; but its original low-key incarnation relied more on inventive scenarios and good writing--qualities that are just as important now as then.--Mark WalkerThe Daleks(sometimes called \"The Dead Planet\") is the second-everDoctor Whoserial. First broadcast between December 1963 and February 1964, the seven-episode story ensured the program's success by introducing the Doctor's most iconic enemies. Five hundred years after a nuclear war has devastated the planet Skaro, the Doctor (William Hartnell), Barbara, Ian, and Susan materialize in a petrified forest where the pacifist, and decidedly camp, Thals face starvation. Our heroes visit a nearby city, the home of the last remaining Daleks, terrifyingly cold-blooded mutants encased in armed, pepper-pot-like shells, and become involved in a desperate battle for survival. Given a nightmarish atmosphere by Tristram Cary's surreal electronic score,The Daleksproved the template for many a future Doctor Who adventure. Hartnell's Doctor is a surprisingly self-serving hero and the ambitious storytelling, which reflects the Cold War fears of the time, belies a tiny budget. The remastered picture sometimes looks digitized, but this story, remade for the cinema asDr. Who and the Daleks(1965) and starring Peter Cushing, is still both an effective, if at times unintentionally hilarious, entertainment and an essential piece of television history. A superior sequel,The Dalek Invasion of Earth, was screened in late 1964.--Gary S DalkinOne of the rarest of the earlyDoctor Whoseries, with William Hartnell as the crusty old Doctor,Edge of Destructionis entirely based in the TARDIS, which has stopped somewhere between worlds and times. The Doctor blames Ian and Barbara, the two teachers who came aboard in search for answers about his granddaughter, Susan, assuming they have committed sabotage in an attempt to return to their own time. They, in turn, in spite of recent shared escapes from Cavemen and Daleks, have no particular reason to trust his sanity. Something is causing one after another of them to act with violent irrationality, and the clock is ticking towards their destruction... This is a claustrophobic two-episode plot in which the series examines closely some of its more beloved assumptions.--Roz Kaveney", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002PHVHK8", "B00007G1U8", "B0002OXVF0", "B005SH65GI", "B0000ADXG3", "B003EGDDLA", "B008D1Q1U6", "B001U3ZYXO", "B000FQIRX6", "B000EMG918", "B0017XOFFU", "B002IW62FU", "B0017XOFGE", "B0049S1NYG", "B00272NJ7U", "B001GJ4U4Q", "B00AATGDXO", "B005SH63I8", "B005SJGI8Q", "B001K2KM9Q", "B000KGGIRI", "B004TPJMRY", "B0009PVZG4", "B000QGE8II", "B0089AD8IO", "B000KGGIR8", "B00447G2X4", "B000067FPC", "B000NJXG8G", "B00ANDGYRM", "B000Z7G87W", "B0002OXVEG", "B007VFF7KA", "B0002F6BSS", "B000QGE8I8", "B002PHVHKI", "B00C6ACVWM", "B001C71IGA", "B004MA1JZY", "B005SH62X4", "B001Q9ECM6", "B002VXEC9O", "B005SH664E", "B000Z7G87C", "B001C71IGU", "B00114XLYQ", "B00114XLZK", "B005FQ1OQ8", "B005SJGI7C", "B008FTX6PO", "B006MVKMTU", "B007VI74VM", "B00ANDDBBE", "B00B1LKXZ4", "B001QCWQ5I", "B001Q9ECNA", "B008D1Q1XI", "B008KHRODG", "B00IO998U2", "B001Q9ECNK", "B00C6ACUQ4", "B005SH646Y", "B004L9GMC6", "B0051V55XA", "B005F265IO", "B000GRUQM4", "B00ANDEL6I", "B001QCWQ58", "B005KQVE2C", "B000UVV2GA", "B0055ASXLI", "B0035JHYMA", "B003X3BYME", "B00CDEJRDC", "B00C6ACXAM", "B00C6ACUF0", "B0072BNJGC", "B000EMG91I", "B0094GSRYW", "B005M2A4D4", "B000B7QCJ0", "B0007VY47C", "B004L9GMBW", "B0002F6BSI", "B00C6ACWLC", "B005KQVD3M", "B008KHIKWK", "B004UOHNES", "B00BXTH49M", "B000FQIRXG", "B0001GF25G", "B00HCK7THS", "B0083SI9AO", "B001QCWQ5S", "B0013XZ6T8", "B00C6ACT3I", "B004TPJMQU", "B00272NJ66", "B005SJGI6I", "B007AAF2ZG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00ANDGYRM", "B002PHVHK8", "B0002OXVF0", "B005SH65GI"]}, "price": 23.58, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 92598}, "asin": "B000CNESV2", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51H5WC6JJ8L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Doctor Who: The Beginning (An Unearthy Child / The Daleks / The Edge of Destruction) (Stories 1 - 3)"}

{"description": "Nobody does comic existential angst like Nicolas Cage, who gets a good workout inThe Weather Man, an underrated slice of quiet desperation. Cage plays David Spritz, a Chicago TV meteorologist who knows only too well the constant uncertainty of predicting the weather. Despite a possible offer from a network morning show, David's life is a mess:  he's estranged from his kids and irritated wife (Hope Davis), he's perpetually at odds with his remote father (Michael Caine), and lately people on the street have had the disconcerting habit of throwing food at him. Director Gore Verbinski (Pirates of the Caribbean) has perhaps too heavy a touch for this kind of comic melancholy, but screenwriter Steven Conrad has an interesting, almost Mamet-like ear for \"written\" dialogue--Cage has a few voiceover monologues, including an uproarious sequence involving tartar sauce and a walk to the store, that are hugely funny. It's possible that we've seen Cage in this kind of character one too many times, but he's still good at it, and his doleful face and pasted-on smile fit the mood of the picture. Unlike the heroes of most Hollywood movies, David Spritz doesn't always--or often--do the right thing, but Cage makes you want to see the poor sap make it.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00012QLB4", "B005F2JRUC", "B00005JLRE", "B000JYW5DW", "B000BBOUW2", "B001J710Z2", "B000PMFRZQ", "B000GRUMRS", "B000CNESJO", "B000TGJ8CQ", "B00E8G5HNM", "B000BYA5G4", "B000059TG6", "B004EPYZOO", "B00003CXXG", "B000IFRT5Q", "B001GCUO02", "B00BTYMPX6", "0767810856", "6304806434", "B00006LPGP", "B002TVQ48A", "B002TVQ48K", "B001MLZNLW", "B00441GZ00", "B00000G02H", "B00008L3UF", "0792838068", "B00AEBB8JM", "B00BJB2GZG", "B004XFZ4JK", "B00062IDGK", "B000OVLBF8", "B007IUEEA2", "B000B8I9Y0", "B002GHHHKG", "B00IKM5OYW", "0792844831", "B000NA1WDQ", "076780676X", "B001JIE7JC", "B00005JLSB", "B0007P0X9G", "B00007AJF8", "B00C6F61HS", "6304711891", "B00005JL7Q", "B00005JK8K", "B00005JN5E", "B00004Z4WR", "B004SIP95G", "B00003CXPV", "B00003L9CH", "B00000JGHL", "B00275EHBY", "B00003CWTI", "B0071HPOV0", "B0015OKWKS", "B002VECMAE", "B00HUCF6KK", "B0039UT3LK", "6301971345", "B000EHRVOW", "B00AEFYAC0", "B000H0MKOC", "B005DCJ2DG", "B00007J5VQ", "B002ZG99KO", "B003102JDM", "B0009R1TI6", "B002CPMB9O", "B00BB67UNW", "B000FDEVA2", "B000CBCWRG", "B000066TGP", "B0013D8LC2", "B00020HAX8", "B00005JLO8", "B00005JLFA", "B001P3SA8K", "B002ZG980U", "B0045HCJFS", "B006TTC5MM", "B000DZIGDU", "B000H6SXSI", "B00AEBB9CS", "B000EDWKXI", "B000NIVJF4", "B00062IVM6", "B00009K011", "B0015OKWKI", "B009L79YFU", "B00005JMJG", "B0002W4UDE", "B000286RNE", "B002ZG983M", "B000UJ48SQ", "B000MEYFY6", "B00008EY9G", "B00AEBB9WI"], "bought_together": ["B00012QLB4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00012QLB4", "B000JLTRIQ", "B005F2JRUC", "B000JYW5DW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 132923}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.47, "brand": "Paramount Home Video", "asin": "B000CSUNQQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51JTWC5Y4HL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Weather Man (Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "Based on Anthony Swofford&#x92;s excellentmemoirabout his experiences as a Marine Sniper in Gulf War I,Jarheadis a war movie in which the waiting is a far greater factor upon the characters than the war itself, and the build up to combat is more drama than what combat is depicted. To some viewers hoping for typical movie action, this will seem like a cruel joke. But it&#x92;s not. It&#x92;s just the story as it was written, and if you liked the book, you will probably like the movie. If you didn&#x92;t, then the movie won&#x92;t change your mind.The movie follows the trajectory of Swofford (played with thoughtful intensity by Jake Gyllenhaal) from wayward Marine recruit (he joined because he \"got lost on the way to college\") to skilled Marine sniper, and on into the desert in preparation for the attack on Iraq. No-nonsense, Marine-for-life Staff Sgt. Sykes (Jamie Foxx), the man who recruited Swofford and his spotter Troy (Peter Sarsgaard) into the sniper team, leads them in training, and in waiting where their lives are dominated by endless tension, pointless exercises in absurdity (like playing football in the scorching heat of the desert in their gas masks so it will look better for the media&#x92;s TV cameras), more training, and constant anticipation of the moment to come when they&#x92;ll finally get to kill. When the war does come, it moves too fast for Swofford&#x92;s sniper team, and the one chance they get at a kill--to do the one thing they&#x92;ve trained so hard and waited so long for--eludes them, leaving them to wonder what was the point of all they had endured.As directed by Sam Mendes (American Beauty), the movie remains very loyal to the language and vision of the book, but it doesn&#x92;t entirely work as the film needs something more than a literal translation to bring out its full potential. Mendes&#x92;s stark and, at times, apocalyptic visuals add a lot and strike the right tone: wide shots of inky-black oil raining down on the vast, empty desert from flaming oil wells contrasted with close-ups of crude-soaked faces struggling through the mire vividly bring to life the meaning of the tagline \"welcome to the suck.\" But much of the second half of the movie will probably leave some viewers feeling disappointed in the cinematic experience, while others might appreciate its microcosmic depiction of modern chaos and aimlessness.Jarheadis one of those examples where the book is better than the movie, but not for lack of trying.--Dan Vancini", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00JRB01RK", "B00275EGWY", "B001FB55L2", "B000065U1N", "B00JRB00RG", "B000P0J09C", "B00JU949TK", "079284646X", "B002ZG97RE", "B0015D20FE", "B00HLTD3ZW", "B00001ZWUS", "B005LAIGYQ", "B00AEBBA36", "B00JA3RVG4", "B002O3Z4Z2", "B008220CQU", "B00HEPE6MM", "B00102F5WK", "B003ASLJOU", "B000095WW8", "B00AZNEW5G", "B00HOGBXS6", "B00005YUPD", "B004XQO90O", "B000Y7WGOW", "B00AIBZMD6", "B00IKM5OCO", "B00JBGSHSQ", "B00005JOFQ", "B0036RPM8Y", "B00AEBB89W", "0743244915", "B003ELKNH2", "B00JL6L4UY", "B004L3AR0K", "B00A34LX2M", "B00005PJ8T", "B004SUDQ22", "B00I4X8KXY", "B00J11U54K", "B00005JK8K", "B00J0IN6Z4", "B0034G4P30", "B00IARA8KM", "B0000AC8LR", "B000M4RG42", "B00HW3LAF2", "B00DL48BM6", "B004LGGXG4", "B0000ACOXL", "B00AEFXVCU", "B0000542CK", "B00005JLOB", "B00006JU8B", "B0000797IO", "B00JPFTS2M", "B00005U8QN", "B005LAIGRS", "B00AEBB86U", "B00HEPC0TS", "B00KDK64DY", "B00JH4SZWK", "B00IO03I6Q", "B00HWWUR02", "B001MZ5W3M", "B000KGGIZK", "B000DZ7YN8", "B00005JMXX", "B00AEBB86A", "B0007KIFGE", "B00IKM5MIA", "1558908315", "B005LAIGLE", "B001N44BVQ", "B00IJS2OHM", "B00005R87B", "B00J5JSV3A", "B00HX0KIAM", "B00ICWO144", "B00GV8B17Q", "B00JQF7ZR6", "B003UESJHO", "B00005JL5F", "B00GMV8JVI", "B00IKM5NJS", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00KNALRZ4", "B00JU94ZPS", "B00E8AVNAE", "B00HVXK15S", "B00004XPPG", "B0034G4P94", "B009POCG0Y", "B008MIL46Q", "B009AMAJPA", "B001AQO3WY", "B00HGJAPYO", "B00ALCBTWU", "B008JFUNKU"], "bought_together": ["B00275EGWY", "B000065U1N"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00275EGWY", "B00JU949TK", "B000065U1N", "B000P0J09C"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 15490}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.75, "brand": "VISIT MORE @ HIBISCUS EXPRESS, http://www.amazon.com/shops/AXD9LOVGJXES3", "asin": "B000DZIGDU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51P2RVVCH9L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Jarhead (Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "WhetherAmerican Dad!will ever enjoyFamily Guy's cult status  remains to be seen, but the first 13 episodes of its inaugural season,  collected in this extras-laden three-disc set, are promising. After a few  episodes, CIA agent Stan Smith and family gradually emerge from the Griffins' formidable shadow, and the show finds its own comic voice. And it sounds a lot like Paul Lynde. That would be Roger (voiced by Seth McFarlane), the housebound alien who saved Stan's life at Area 51 and now lives with the Smiths. Not as inspired a creation is Klaus, the German-accented goldfish who lusts after Stan's wife, Francine. He does, though, have an inspired meta-moment in the episode \"Bullocks to Stan,\" in which he provides faux scene-specific commentary (during the episode!) in anticipation of the show's release on DVD (\"I wasn't sure about the Squeaky Fromme reference,\" he offers, \"but it's a smart joke, and the fans have come to expect that from us\"). As for the rest of the clan, Steve's children are the typical dysfunctional siblings: Steve, a socially awkward geek, and Hayley, a liberal counterpoint to red, white, and blue-blooded Stan--at least liberal enough to sleep with Stan's boss, Bullock (playfully voiced by Patrick Stewart) in the episode \"Bullocks to Stan.\"Though the jokes inAmerican Dad!are not as free-associative as inFamily Guy, McFarlane cannot seem to resist dispensing with character integrity for a gratuitous potshot at, say, Lisa Kudrow. But as withFamily Guy,American Dad!tears at the sitcom envelope. The blasphemous episode \"Deacon Stan, Jesus Man,\" had the distinction of being voted \"Worst TV Show of the Week\" by the Parents Television Council. AndAmerican Dad!has its own version ofFamily Guy's surreal titanic bouts between Peter Griffin and that chicken. The episode \"Homeland Insecurity\" features a digression in which a Department of Water and Power worker greedily kills his partner over a gem-encrusted gold \"turd,\" only to find out his wife is having an affair. As he wails to the heavens, the words \"To be continued\" appear onscreen. According to the audio commentary, the writers do indeed intend to continue this compelling soap opera. So that's something to look forward to.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000NNK4DM", "B0012KSUTA", "B001RIZ7OI", "B003CN5B7E", "B003L77G7Y", "B0053O8A32", "B00BYNL8DU", "B00LFW6BA0", "B000083C6V", "B000HT3P6U", "B001VFM0ZG", "B000AQ68Z0", "B000RO6JZO", "B002JVWQYG", "B00008YGRV", "B0012018OE", "B003DZX46G", "B003L77G9W", "B0058RN7KA", "B0058YPMHO", "B00E0FW054", "B00FR81Z40", "B003V3FVQ6", "B008412UKA", "B000A3DFV8", "B008412UQ4", "B001RP976A", "B00BI5YEWG", "B00HDU9UOW", "B00775R45A", "B007ZFR67I", "B00023P49C", "B00008YGRS", "B0000AQS81", "B0001ZWLVU", "B0000CABL2", "B000ADWCYY", "B0001MZ7KA", "B004696M94", "B002HQK5O6", "B00005JM3G", "B00023P49M", "B00CO8WWS4", "B000KLQUMQ", "B007KFZ85K", "B0006Z2L2Y", "B008AITJ7O", "B005QIOJUI", "B00K8HAJN8", "B000AQ68VO", "B003X4KHRG", "B009SQ9Q5M", "B00363WGB4", "B000CNESM6", "B0040JHX0W", "B0002WZRSG", "B00F77MAO0", "B001N9VW5Y", "B00J5LXPPM", "B0007PAM06", "B000RPD0DC", "B0002XVQT4", "B000E0OE3K", "B000FSME2Y", "B000EHSVDC", "B0006B41GM", "B000RW3VDE", "B000R7I3XC", "B000F8O2QK", "B007KFZ7UQ", "B00F4NPBI4", "B006W93ELK", "B001BGS17G", "B002LARYTW", "B001L1S1PI", "B000ABKHZC", "B001G0MFFG", "B000RZIGX6", "B00008YGRZ", "B003KZ27N0", "B0007CILMA", "B00158K0V0", "B000067DNE", "B001O0TWXG", "B007KFZ8B4", "B000S76LKI", "B007KFZ7PG", "B000A6T27G", "B0024FAR52", "B0016KCCCM", "B00008EY6Q", "B0018O5WUU", "B005CHTXWC", "B0036TGTEI", "B004MLEYTG", "B007KFZ7YM", "B000B5XOR0", "B005QIOJ3A", "B000UZDO62", "B00DNQCH0Y"], "bought_together": ["B000NNK4DM", "B0012KSUTA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003L77G7Y", "B000083C6V", "B000NNK4DM", "B000AQ68Z0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 67450}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 14.59, "brand": "20th Century Fox", "asin": "B000E6ES9O", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51KK1TPJ7RL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "American Dad!, Vol. 1"}

{"description": "A science fiction-Western and comedy-drama with echoes ofThe Wild Wild WestandRaiders of the Lost Ark,The Adventures of Brisco County Jr.: The Complete Seriesis uniquely entertaining. Anchored by the comically heroic style of likable B-movie actor Bruce Campbell,Adventureslasted one television season in 1993-94. But it left behind a full 27 episodes (including two two-part stories) full of classic TV Western production values and a running storyline that resemblesThe X-Filesafter awhile.Campbell plays Brisco County Jr., a bounty hunter and son of a legendary U.S. marshal (R. Lee Ermey) gunned down by the villainous John Bly (Billy Drago) and his band of misfits. The younger Brisco is hired by a consortium of businessmen to protect their interests from the likes of Bly, and while he's dedicated to that cause, Brisco is also determined to avenge his father's murder. Helping him do a little of both is a fussy attorney, Socrates Poole (Christian Clemenson); a rival bounty hunter, Lord Bowler (Julius Carry); a wacky inventor, Professor Wickwire (John Astin); and a sultry saloon singer, Dixie (Kelly Rutherford). Rockets, mysterious orbs, and superhuman strength are some of the delightfully out-of-their-element phenomena that find themselves alongside more conventional cowpoke ingredients, including a horse so smart he can chew the ropes binding Brisco's hands. For the most part, the stories stand alone. But as the season progresses, a lot of things get weirder, albeit in a good way: the truth about Bly and his connection to a golden orb everyone wants, for example, are certainly unexpected. But the show is always dazzling, often satiric (\"Oy!\" Dixie exclaims when Brisco outlines the steps involved in stopping a runaway wagon they're trapped within), yet heartening in an old-fashioned way. Special features include Campbell's reading of a chapter about the series in his autobiography.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000FJH5MC", "B001KEGR5M", "B0009JE6FM", "B001KEGR5W", "B00005JOJP", "B000WC38FA", "B000AQ69QS", "B00F3L8P26", "B00LT1JHLW", "B00KTZALDC", "B0001LQJMQ", "0312291450", "B001CQONOA", "031231261X", "B009ERK2UI", "B005NKIPUO", "B004ZBFRG2", "B001KEGR7U", "B004EXWGJW", "B000PFUAN2", "B003BGZ61S", "B00IXPWGIS", "B00E96AY20", "B00LLV9XJQ", "B003XMKU3Y", "B001AQO3XS", "0312242646", "B00LMBUR6S", "B00IS6WQ2S", "B002PQ7JQK", "B004XM38CS", "B0006UEVUE", "0783227434", "B00404ME2E", "B0056GLNQI", "B004PQM81E", "B005UFUU6E", "B00LCAD24S", "B00L326LTI", "B00LNBQ8SI", "B00KUS5YGC", "B00HZMZ286", "B003XMKU0M", "B00KDU8HQQ", "B000H7JCFK", "B0063DOV2Q", "B000BF0C8E", "B000XJD3K2", "B000BGR1B4", "B00DYQ1GBE", "B003QS0E54", "B00B00HUC0", "B006LPHY6G", "B008R52LA2", "B002ZCY84U", "B00005JNIS", "B0081QF6Q8", "B00IGVJH0E", "B000HEVZ7G", "B00FQ1PSO6", "B000N2HD6O", "B003H9LIU2", "B000NOKFGW", "B00005JNU5", "B002GY9F9K", "B000IJ7A5Q", "B002QU1Z1K", "B00L9SXSCE", "B00C6F61IW", "B00J2T1856", "B0014BQR38", "B001C0PFG6", "B009OE2NZI", "B00LNBQ8UG", "B006P2TA44", "0783228457", "B004HHX9T6", "B001D2WUD4", "B000ELL1QC", "B000YENUOK", "B005GYXN2M", "B000RXVNCO", "B00LBHOCHS", "B00L9K2EGS", "B00JAD6BYW", "B00009WVTJ", "B00E5G03I4", "B0016MJ6P6", "B000HT38HQ", "B00402FGE4", "B00F77MAC2", "B000LXGXY8", "B003UD7J26", "B00IF0KAYS", "B004EXWGHY", "B00IMQZV3U", "B00JRENJTY", "B00IU6HPIQ", "B00005JN8Q", "B0009A407A"], "bought_together": ["B000FJH5MC", "B00005JOJP"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000FJH5MC", "B00AQ6FFUI", "B00F3L8P26", "0312291450"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 2338}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 18.8, "brand": "Warner Brothers", "asin": "B000F7CMPE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61VP0BFB2GL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr.: The Complete Series"}
{"description": "What was in the Hatch? The cliffhanger from season one of Lost was answered in its opening sequences, only to launch into more questions as the season progressed. That's right: Just when you say \"Ohhhhh,\" there comes another \"What?\" Thankfully, the show's producers sprinkle answers like tasty morsels throughout the season, ending with a whopper: What caused Oceanic Air Flight 815 to crash in the first place? As the show digs into more revelations about its inhabitant's pasts, it also devotes a good chunk to new characters (Hey, it's an island; you never know who you're going to run into.) First, there are the \"Tailies,\" passengers from the back end of the plane who crashed on the other side of the island. Among them are the wise, God-fearing ex-drug lord Mr. Eko (standout Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje); devoted husband Bernard (Sam Anderson); psychiatrist Libby (Cynthia Watros, whose character has more than one hidden link to the other islanders); and ex-cop Ana Lucia (Michelle Rodriguez), by far the most infuriating character on the show, despite how much the writers tried to incur sympathy with her flashback. Then there are the Others, first introduced when they kidnapped Walt (Malcolm David Kelley) at the end of season one. Brutal and calculating, their agenda only became more complex when one of them (played creepily by Michael Emerson) was held hostage in the hatch and, quite handily, plays mind games on everyone's already frayed nerves. The original cast continues to battle their own skeletons, most notably Locke (Terry O'Quinn), Sun (Yunjin Kim) and Michael (Harold Perrineau), whose obsession with finding Walt takes a dangerous turn. The love triangle between Jack (Matthew Fox), Kate (Evangeline Lilly) and Sawyer (Josh Holloway), which had stalled with Sawyer's departure, heats up again in the second half. Despite the bloating cast size (knocked down by a few by season's end) Lost still does what it does best: explores the psyche of people, about whom \"my life is an open book\" never applies, and cracks into the social dynamics of strangers thrust into Lord of the Flies-esque situations. Is it all a science experiment? A dream? A supernatural pocket in the universe? Likely, any theory will wind up on shaky ground by the season's conclusion. But hey, that's the fun of it. This show was made for DVD, and you can pause and slow-frame to your heart's content. Just try and keep that head-spinning to a minimum.On the DVDCommentaries by various cast members and producers reveal little other than the occasional easter egg (the Dharma logo on the shark fin, Walt's mumbling translating to \"Don't push the button; the button is bad\" backwards). But disc seven opens with an eerie Hanso Foundation instructional video, leading you to eight hours of bonus features, including cast members' own theories, deleted scenes, and featurettes on specific episodes. It's all well and good for Lost fanatics, but if you want the cream of the crop, check out: \"Lost Connections,\" an interactive feature that reveals how all the islanders are actually linked (for instance, one of the officers who captured Sayid during the Gulf War is Kate's father); a Channel UK promo for the show directed by David LaChappelle in which cast members suck in their cheeks and, dressed in evening wear, tango in slow motion as if in a Calvin Klein ad (it has to be a joke, right?); and \"The World According to Sawyer,\" which strings together each of the un-PC nicknames and pop culture references spewed by Holloway's character. Favorites include \"Chewie\" for Jin and \"Ponce de Leon\" for Ana Lucia. It's by far the cherry on top of a sweet dessert. --Ellen A.

{"description": "Most TV shows never make it eight seasons, but thenThe Simpsonsis not most TV shows.  At a point where other shows would generally become stale and repetitive, Matt Groening & Co. pull out the stops to come up with one of the most creative and hilarious seasons in the whole series. Cases in point for season eight (1996-1997)  include \"Treehouse of Horror VII,\" in which aliens Kang and Kodos make a bizarre run for President having taken on the appearances of Bill Clinton and Bob Dole; \"Bart After Dark,\" in which Bart gets a job at The Maison Derriere (featuring one of their most popular songs, \"The Spring in Springfield\"); and one of the great all-time episodes, \"The Simpsons Spin-off Showcase,\" a trilogy of Simpsons spin-offs that never made it to prime-time (the final segment--\"The Simpson Family Smile-Time Variety Hour\"--is about the best six minutes of parody in the entireSimpsonscanon). Season eight also features some of the most notable guest appearances: Rodney Dangerfield as Mr. Burns&#x92;s long lost son; Gillian Anderson and David Duchovny as Scully and Mulder fromX-Filesin \"The Springfield Files;\" \"The Brother from Another Series\" which brilliantly pairs up Kelsey Grammar as Sideshow Bob with his brother Cecil (David Hyde Pierce) in a parallel of theirFrasiercharacters; and in a major casting coup, Johnny Cash shows up in the form of a red fox as Homer&#x92;s spirit guide in \"El Viaje Misterioso de Nuestro Jomer\" (also known as \"The Chili Pepper episode\"). Other notable episodes include \"The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show,\" a fun wink to the audience from the writers about keeping the show fresh without ruining it, and the send up ofMary Poppins\"Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiala(annoyed grunt)cious,\" which has one of their most memorable endings when Shary Bobbins floats off under her umbrella (\"So long Superman,\" Barney cries)... only to get sucked into a jet engine from a passing airplane.

{"description": "\"Let's get dangerous!\" Indeed, Disney's delightful Darkwing Duck, a masked mallard superhero, can get very dangerous--though the biggest danger he presents, typically, is to himself. Darkwing (DW to his friends) is the well-meaning if flamboyant (and klutzy) protector of St. Canard, a city that looks suspiciously like San Francisco and even has a Golden Gate-like bridge in which the winged avenger has tucked away his secret headquarters. A publicity-seeking ham, DW doesn't possess any superpowers, but has some nifty gadgets and the determination to meddle with nefarious plans of high-profile villains. Among them are the fascinating Bushroot, a disillusioned scientist who turns himself into a plant and has the power to make flora do his bidding; Quackerjack, a cackling, Joker-like evildoer; Megavolt, a whining dog who controls electricity; and the Liquidator, another pooch who is made of, well, water.DW fancies himself a lone wolf, so to speak, but unlike Batman, he doesn't have the knack for controlling every detail of his life. As a result, this would-be loner acquires a sidekick, a fawning pilot named Launchpad, and an adopted daughter, the headstrong Gosalyn, neither of whom he anticipated.

{"description": "Consistently solid with some major developments, the fifth season ofSmallvillekicks the characters off to college, but not before finishing the cataclysmic disaster that ended the fourth season.  With Chloe transported to the Arctic Circle and Kryptonian supervillains in town, Clark (Tom Welling) is in the Fortress of Solitude meeting Jor-El (voiced by Terence Stamp).  He gives up his powers, but to get them back will cost him the life of someone he loves.The even bigger development is that Clark and Lana (Kristin Kreuk) finally give up their dalliances with others and become an official couple.  That means the other girls in Clark's life become fifth and sixth wheels, so Chloe (Allison Mack) reveals the secret she's been keeping from Clark and becomes a best pal.  Super-gorgeous Lois's (Erica Durance, now part of the opening credits) banter with Clark loses its bite without any sexual tension so instead she meets Arthur \"AC\" Curry, a fantastic swimmer who has an eye for Lois and an accusing one toward Lex (Michael Rosenbaum) and LutherCorp.  He's not the only one; Clark's Central Kansas A&M; professor, Milton Fine (James Marsters) hires Clark to help him on his project, an expose of LutherCorp.  Lex is the pivotal character of the season.  His relationship with his best friend, Clark, now history, Lex has aChristmas Carol-type dream in which he sees himself in a law-abiding--and happy--life.  (That episode, \"Lexmas,\" also has some amusing interplay involving Clark and Chloe.)  Undeterred, he decides on a life of power and dives into a state senate race against Jonathan Kent with gusto, though a fanatical Lex supporter turns the race into a literal one for life and death.  Lionel Luthor (John Glover) also makes a strong comeback in this season, pulling unseen levers and making everyone wonder exactly what he knows.There's some fun.  \"Thirst\" is a tribute toBuffy the Vampire Slayer, and another DC Comics character, Cyborg (Teen Titans), appears.  Carrie Fisher plays Chloe's editor atThe Daily Planet, and \"Exposed\" reunites Schneider with formerDukes of Hazzardcostar Tom Wopat, and the two go peeling out in a vehicle.  But things come to a head in the series 100th episode, when Jor-El's prediction comes to pass and splintered relationships end up leading in unexpected directions.  Then in the season finale's cliffhanger, Clark has to face three of his enemies.  DVD features include commentary on two episodes and a half-hour examination of the 100th episode, from writing through production.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000N6SE4U", "B0009A5MUO", "B000X5SMXY", "B0002Y0QV2", "B001FB4VZS", "B002JVWRDQ", "B0001JXPPC", "B003L77GG0", "B00005JLKB", "B000R206FK", "B0012U7IWU", "B001FB4W02", "B002JVWRE0", "B006CR2ON6", "B003L77GGA", "B00080ZG2O", "B00CN009Y2", "B00BBXSPCK", "B00BBXSPES", "B00G4SCOJW", "B000BT96EG", "B00G4SCMW6", "B00G4SCKAK", "B00BGI086Q", "1401246370", "B00F4FFO8E", "B00DX88IL4", "B00DMZER90", "B00G7QPX6C", "B001DJLD2G", "140124291X", "B00JF5G8WU", "B008JFUPFI", "B00DTRR43W", "B000FP2OPY", "B000SMNL92", "B000P6XQ50", "B000GYI32M", "1401238246", "B004LROMWU", "B000HT3P6U", "B00260HH30", "1563891492", "1401240941", "B00ED2IBXE", "B001QOGY54", "B00BHBPEYI", "B00IWTVDUW", "B00DPJEWD4", "B0018BDDFE", "B000ATQYXI", "B0000640T0", "1401241824", "B00BBAQD6S", "B0051SFSAS", "B0050MB5P2", "B0007SL1ZI", "B00BGI08GG", "B000PMFRTC", "B00EIL7E9C", "B000CCBC9O", "B00KM9MP9I", "B004EXNHO0", "B004SEUIWY", "B009LDCXNY", "6303961614", "B000UVV2GA", "B000F8O2P6", "B002N5N5MK", "B00DYEN6XC", "B000F8O2OW", "B00BN0WQ5I", "B00B5J6A7W", "B00915G4IC", "B0041QSZ7O", "B002DQL34G", "B0009JE6FC", "B009LDCWWG", "B008JFUS0U", "B0009JE6FM", "B004HW7JQU", "B00E5G03J8", "1401247172", "B006UKX5QK", "B001MVWRNE", "B00FFEM0W2", "1401210600", "B004HW7JNS", "B00023E88U", "B004YM6JI2", "B000GTLB4Y", "B0011FLGZQ", "B000IJ79UW", "B00022FWEU", "B004PHSTTS", "B001QE99AQ", "B008CJ0KBU", "B009LDD4BO", "B003L77GGK", "B00IYRLUAU"], "bought_together": ["B000N6SE4U", "B000X5SMXY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0009A5MUO", "B0002Y0QV2", "B000N6SE4U", "B000X5SMXY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 6639}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 21.73, "brand": "Warner Brothers", "asin": "B000G1R4SO", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51VQnIOhFxL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Smallville: Season 5"}
{"description": "Big Love, HBO's newest buzzworthy series, recalls Groucho Marx's blithe proposal to two women inAnimal Crackers. \"Why, that's bigamy,\" one of the women exclaims. Groucho responds, \"Yes, and it's big of me, too.\" But Bill Henrickson's (Bill Paxton) situation is hardly a laughing matter. Bill is a modern-day polygamist who lives in suburban Salt Lake City with his seven children and three \"sister-wives\": Barbara (Jeanne Tripplehorn, never better), the more mature anchor of the household; Nicki (Chloe Sevigny), who spitefully refers to her as \"Boss Lady\"; and recent addition Margene (charming Ginnifer Goodwin), insecure and childlike. A series that puts a human face on polygamy is brimming with prurient possibilities.Big Love's first two episodes are veritable commercials for Viagra, as Bill struggles to keep up with the demands of his spouses, with whom the sleeping arrangements are strictly scheduled. But once this more sensational aspect of \"plural marriage\" is dealt with,Big Lovemoves on to focus on the emotional, spiritual and financial pressures that beset Bill and his families. As the dreamlike opening credit sequence (scored to the Beach Boys' ethereal \"God Only Knows\") illustrates, Bill is a man on thin ice. He is carrying mortgages on three adjoining homes. A home-improvement store entrepreneur, he has just cut the ribbon on his second store and is planning a third. His wives, not immune to jealousies, vie for dominant position. And then there's Roman (Harry Dean Stanton; and any series that puts this venerable character actor and hipster saint in our homes on a weekly basis deserves our big love), the sinister leader of an outlaw fundamentalist compound, who has an escalating disagreement with Bill over the repayment of his loan that helped Bill build his fledgling empire (\"There's man's law,\" he states ominously, \"and there's God's law\").There are further complications that makeBig Loveso compelling. Bill suspects that his raw-nerved mother (Grace Zabriskie) may be poisoning his father (Bruce Dern). Nicki is a shopaholic accruing nearly $60,000 in credit-card debt. Overtures by new neighbors threaten to expose Bill's unorthodox and illicit living arrangements. The polygamy factor puts a subversive spin on traditional matrimonial melodrama. When Nicki plans her son's disastrous birthday party, her list of \"immediate family\" tops 150. When Roman, who is Nicki's father, arrives, Bill proclaims he is not welcome in his \"homes.\" As withRome,Big Lovemay require a little patience. But this fascinating portrayal of a shadowy subculture, the intelligent writing, and the estimable ensemble will soon make you feel like part of the families.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000RTBDV4", "B0011UMC72", "B002ZCY82W", "B003L77GLA", "B005SEDI5M", "B0029O0ANW", "B0001KL5DA", "B004BZ5AHI", "B008PJZDXW", "B0007R4SWM", "B004U6GWZM", "B00HW3EXCE", "B001OQCVFG", "B00J5LXT44", "B005LAJ1JA", "B00JF5GAZA", "B0041KKZKA", "B000Q6GUW0", "B003L77GPG", "B00IYMSMTM", "B00JVQ7PWU", "B0009NZ2W4", "B0012CJQYG", "B002ZCY8CC", "B000E6EK42", "B0090XPH06", "B000V86OKG", "B003L77GS8", "B00005Y6YJ", "B00IBIIQTU", "B0012CJQY6", "B00IYRLUAU", "B001FB4W0W", "B000YABIQ6", "B00HI4EGQA", "B0013ZGN9I", "B00079FUI6", "B0007QS324", "B00GMV8IVE", "B004JR3OW6", "B000P12LWY", "B000Q6GUKW", "B000FFJYE8", "B000VTHYAE", "B009TE9GNK", "B00BUUAV08", "B009TE9HAW", "B00BGI076M", "B00BUYWJEA", "B00166UFSY", "B008CFZQQS", "B000YW8RPE", "B00DXP7L88", "B00000FBH2", "B009LDCZ7I", "B005LAJ1H2", "B00FOHHMWI", "B001NXDIMK", "B009LDD54K", "B0032UYFA6", "B00280LZAE", "B004HW7JH4", "B0092Q82LC", "B00C1LIZMQ", "B002ZCY80O", "B000BYA5HS", "B0050QNO2U", "B009RYXSNQ", "B005LAJ16I", "B002LITH76", "B0060MYKYY", "B00JF5G8WU", "B000BNXD6O", "B00005NOHO", "B00E3V9N1E", "B00008G7UI", "B00915G6WQ", "B0018CWEYO", "B0013FSL0C", "B000BO7DWI", "B000F1IQI2", "B001GCUER0", "B00H7LINKE", "B001AQR39O", "B009PNGBWY", "B00GTZWXFU", "B003UD7J6W", "B00HUCF420", "B000P6YNTI", "B0001GF2F6", "B000FIMG5Y", "B000067S1G", "B004YM6JSW", "B000RC2ES2", "B0007YMVWO", "B0032JTV6A", "B0038M2ANC", "B000HT38EO"], "bought_together": ["B000RTBDV4", "B0011UMC72"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004U6GWZM", "B003L77GLA", "B000RTBDV4", "B0011UMC72"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 57927}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 25.49, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B000GTLQVW", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41%2BeKegqGtL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Big Love: Season 1"}
{"description": "The Christmas Shoesbounces between two families--the Layton household, where father Robert (Rob Lowe,The West Wing) is so consumed with his work that he misses his daughter's recital; and the Andrews home, where mother Maggie (Kimberly Williams,According to Jim) has been diagnosed with a fatal heart ailment. Desperate to make his mother's last moments happy, Maggie's son Nathan struggles to buy a pair of red dancing shoes that seem like a pair Maggie remembers from her childhood.  Naturally, the lives of these families become intertwined, particularly when Robert's wife takes over Maggie's choral program--which topples the already troubled balance between Kate and Robert. Perhaps because Rob Lowe is usually stereotyped as glib and insincere,The Christmas Shoesfeels surprisingly heartfelt. The earnestness ofThe Christmas Shoessurprises because the story originated in the famously sappy country song of the same name, and movies based on songs rarely feel anything but plastic and contrived. There are certainly moments whenThe Christmas Shoeslays on the sentiment woefully thick, but you'd have to be an ogre not to be touched when Maggie and her husband have one last dance.

{"description": "This clever, funny big-screen adaptation of Lauren Weisberger's best-seller takes some of the snarky bite out of the chick lit book, but smoothes out the characters' boxy edges to make a more satisfying movie. There's no doubtThe Devil Wears Prada belongs to Meryl Streep, who turns in an Oscar&#65533;-worthy (seriously!) strut as the monster editor-in-chief ofRunway, an elite fashion magazine full of size-0, impossibly well-dressed plebes. This makes new second-assistant Andrea (Anne Hathaway), who's smart but an unacceptable size 6, stick out like a sore thumb. Streep has a ball sending her new slave on any whimsical errand, whether it's finding the seventh (unpublished) Harry Potter book or knowing what type she means when she wants \"skirts.\" Though Andrea thumbs her nose at the shallow world of fashion (she's only doing the job to open doors to a position atThe New Yorker someday), she finds herself dually disgusted yet seduced by the perks of the fast life. The film sends a basic message: Make work your priority, and you'll be rich and powerful... and lonely. Any other actress would have turned Miranda into a scenery-chewing Cruella, but Streep's underplayed, brilliant comic timing make her a fascinating, unapologetic character. Adding frills to the movie's fun are Stanley Tucci as Streep's second-in-command, Emily Blunt (My Summer of Love) as the overworked first assistant, Simon Baker as a sexy writer, and breathtaking couture designs any reader ofVogue would salivate over. --Ellen A.

{"description": "A disturbing film about a recovering drug addict trying to regain control of her life,Sherrybabysuccinctly depicts what can happen when want and desire aren't offset by control. In this bleak indie film, Sherry Swanson (Maggie Gyllenhaal,Stranger Than Fiction,Secretary) has just been released from a three-year stint in prison. Dressed in her inappropriate uniform of a halter top and oh-so-high platform heels, she goes to brother's house to see her 5-year-old daughter, Lexie (Ryan Simpkins). Sherry is determined to be a mother to her child, but without a home, job, or any other form of stability, she grows frustrated and jealous of her brother and sister-in-law's roles in Lexie's life. Tall and willowy, Gyllenhaal brings a sad desperation and simmering sexuality to the role. Sherry's middle-class childhood was a blur of sex and drugs, and she seems incapable of breaking out of that destructive trap. While the script by first-time feature film director Laurie Collyer isn't wholly original, the picture moves at a good pace, giving insight as to why Sherry's resigned to using sex to get what she wants. While the family secret doesn't come as a complete surprise, it is somewhat perplexing that no one addresses it. Ultimately, it's Gyllenhaal who makes you care about a character that most people would've given up on.--Jae-Ha Kim", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000I0QL7I", "B0007CEXYK", "B000E6ESU8", "B00008MTXI", "B0006IIKRG", "B000LAZDPG", "6305692572", "B00004UEDQ", "B00A2H9QN8", "B000ERVK4Y", "B003YKYX9M", "B00005JM23", "B0045HCJ08", "B003Y5H59C", "B00005Q4CS", "B000Z3N1HQ", "6305162026", "B0017X1WGK", "6305594333", "B001E95ZNS", "B007VI5AQ8", "B00JAGF9HE", "B0052ADP6Y", "B0000549B1", "B000BBOUUE", "B003AC98V2", "B00009Y3QI", "B00EUENWIY", "B00049QQHI", "B002UNMWTC", "B004V4RW8O", "B000GB5M3S", "B000J10F8C", "B00005JH9M", "0578045427", "0792838068", "B0039Y774Q", "B0000ZMGWK", "B000XSKDBA", "B0015VQAZM", "B007TSV4GK", "B003JO6OPO", "B004SUDQC2", "B001CRC4DG", "B0050ODZ6M", "B00005JMIJ", "B00ET2ODTE", "B000ICL3NI", "B00023P4I8", "B00008972P", "B00005JMU1", "B0002KPIQY", "B0040J1RX6", "B00GRZPRB4", "B00AFEXRME", "B000PKG8TM", "B000N3SU92", "B00HOGBXS6", "B004QL7JYO", "B0006IIPLM", "B00641Y2ZS", "B0000DBJ8B", "B00INUK5WM", "B00K0MM4AM", "B006GL8NQ0", "B0016I0AKU", "B00005JKN2", "B001CC7PRQ", "B000LC3I9W", "B00000IBL1", "B001C5LLVE", "B0009GX1XI", "B001FRNB9E", "B001PPLJIQ", "B006M3M5FM", "B001URA5Y8", "B0029Z8K74", "B00EMAGKNU", "B00013RC2K", "B004YCKKFK", "B004L3AR0K", "B00AEFXJ86", "B000067IZ3", "B002Q3MZXE", "B00JPSYPCM", "B001AIQ14A", "B00005U14H", "B003Z8ZC2A", "B00IARA89S", "B0010DM3R4", "B0015XHQXU", "B000FTCF3G", "B00005QJIG", "B000TLTCQI", "B004RD3YFE", "B00114XTHA", "076782170X", "B000EZ9084", "B0057ZAA6W"], "bought_together": ["B0007CEXYK", "B000I0QL7I"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000I0QL7I", "6305692572", "B00008MTXI", "B0007CEXYK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 28252}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.25, "brand": "Universal Studios", "asin": "B000JBXXYK", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516NtGsG%2BnL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Sherrybaby"}

Critics are calling Idlewild \"a fresh, hip and imaginative extravaganza that will dazzle and thrill audiences from beginning to end\" (Shawn Edwards, FOX-TV)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0009S4IGA", "B00007L4KF", "B000BRLRUO", "B001P3SA94", "B00AEFYG3S", "B004YCKJGU", "0792838076", "B000JLTRH2", "6305505780", "B00AEFY6TW", "1558908390", "B000BOH8X2", "B00BTYPWDQ", "B00007AJG2", "B000FS9ULC", "B003BV8I3Q", "B00465I1CE", "B000Y11B8K", "6305428409", "B00007AJG1", "B000TLOMPE", "B002CWKU36", "B00005JND5", "B00AEFXTKO", "B0041QSZS8", "B00005AQML", "B0006IIOHC", "B003HKN534", "B00AEFYE08", "B000051YMS", "B0000JBUHI", "B00066FAQW", "B000UNYJWM", "B000P0J0CE", "B00AEFYAC0", "B00465I192", "B000Q7ZNZ4", "B00005JLG1", "B00000JGHV", "B000YAF4Q6", "B000BITV9W", "6305120013", "B0000560W6", "B0068FZ0W4", "B000B5XOSY", "B00000JGHO", "B00125WAWS", "B002GSXKOM", "B000056BOW", "B002CA68NO", "B002CA68N4", "B000VNMMVQ", "B000060MWA", "B00BYS0RQE", "0783237367", "B00441GZ1Y", "B00007ELEO", "B00004Y2R1", "B000035P5I", "B00003CY51", "B00769U94K", "B00BEL4QFO", "B001KKU9DM", "B00005RDAN", "0783240201", "0783230524", "B00L5Y8GJC", "B004D45NY2", "B00008977B", "B000E40QC4", "B0000TWMWK", "B008Y1YJN6", "B000P0J092", "B00AEBB9AA", "B0000YEE6M", "B001K98MGE", "B00066FAVW", "B0000549B2", "B00005JL72", "B00G4Q3KOC", "0767821955", "B00005RIJQ", "B003Y5H4ZC", "B001DJLD12", "B002ZG99RW", "B000HDZKLO", "B0000AGWFX", "B0000013GB", "B0002CTSV8", "B000667HHW", "B000053VBD", "B00006LPHJ", "B000063RQO", "B0001FR3HW", "B003Y5H58S", "B004SIP93S", "B000069I0E", "B00AEFXY6I", "B00H47IX5G", "B00005JLON"], "bought_together": ["B0009S4IGA", "B001P3SA94"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0009S4IGA", "B001P3SA94", "B00AEFYG3S", "B00007L4KF"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 27677}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.29, "brand": "Universal Studios", "asin": "B000JJSL1W", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51G1QPYFW3L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Idlewild (Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "A moving and inspiring story of redemption and personal triumph in the face of great odds,Jet Li's Fearlessis the based-on-facts story of Chinese folk hero Huo Yuanjia (Jet Li). The son of a martial-arts master whose greatest strength was his restraint, Huo grows into an unbeatable fighter whose pride and thoughtlessness lead to a chain of tragic losses. After a classic wanderer-in-the-wilderness penance, Huo reinvents himself as a mature instructor of Wushu, a martial arts system that embraces all forms of fighting without preference or pre-judgement. He also becomes a populist symbol, at the dawn of the 20th century, of China's refusal to entirely capitulate to the boot of Western colonialists. Taking on whatever European, American, or Japanese fighter the outsiders bring in to demoralize the natives, Huo becomes a legend that, in real life, is still revered. Thrillingly directed by Ronny Yu (Warriors of Virtue),Jet Li&#x92;s Fearlessis a dazzling action movie that transcends its breathless fight sequences with Huo's sportsmanship virtues, i.e., knowing when you've won by example, rather than by the fist. Jet Li is superb in the role.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004SIP88Y", "B000A2IPQY", "B003EVAG4C", "B0016MJ6JC", "B004U7MR0K", "B003INBNXO", "B0007Q6VXC", "B00003CXR4", "B001MEJY9Q", "B00008EY6M", "B001BEK8HO", "B00003CY5A", "B004I1AGTC", "B0009VBTQY", "B00005V1WW", "B005KK2FWG", "B004U7MR1O", "B000X1Z0C4", "B005FQ1OOK", "B000MRA592", "B000I0RNWU", "B005ZMBEXU", "B003DVB7F0", "B004P8R9O8", "B002XTXGA2", "B000JYW5BO", "B0030A6ICG", "B004GJYRKA", "B00005OOQ1", "B000MM0LEG", "B00HSJ2EMI", "B0051SFTGQ", "B002C6VMIY", "B008IG0B0C", "B000QGEB12", "B00005YUNV", "B001MEJY9G", "B000EE3FUY", "B00K2LC44M", "B004VW4V9E", "B004BZ5ADW", "B004XQO8MS", "B000GFLKDU", "B000ICLU7C", "B009VL2AZM", "B006C1S1DY", "B001L67A4G", "B00B6OEE7O", "B00284G2BC", "B00ET2ODYY", "B005E7SEZW", "B00104AYGK", "B00518HBAI", "B0055CP9EK", "B000W95QDK", "B00C3ALL9O", "0780619331", "B00FLCYIAA", "B009VL2A5M", "B006LOC01G", "B00518HB94", "B0000694WE", "B0015RCUR8", "B00EI3Y1QO", "B004I7F862", "B003E1QCYK", "B005NQ5LQ4", "B006MWA91A", "B001H5X6PI", "B000683VH0", "0783226985", "B00GXFZOYI", "B0056OZI0W", "B000050B7J", "B0035V35P8", "B0019PL2W0", "B00003CXGG", "B000HC2M3Y", "B008XEZXES", "B00441GYWO", "B0002O7XUE", "B000I2KOB0", "B0015RCUQO", "B0085A9J18", "B004SUDQAY", "B00005JMEW", "B005F96UGO", "B0010X741O", "B004H2CXBQ", "B00005JMUA", "B003LN0NXC", "B0060KGSGO", "B0018PH3NS", "B0056OZI0M", "B008WAM36O", "B005M9VSMI", "B00B1CGFD2", "B000FELD8Y", "B00005BJX9"], "bought_together": ["B004SIP88Y"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004GXKBGK", "B003INBNXO", "B004SIP88Y", "B001BEK8HO"]}, "price": 10.28, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 107058}, "asin": "B000K2UW06", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51qxHWcGBlL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Jet Li's Fearless (Unrated Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "Martin Scorsese makes a welcome return to the mean streets (of Boston, in this case) withThe Departed, hailed by many as Scorsese's best film sinceCasino. Since this crackling crime thriller is essentially a Scorsese-stamped remake of the acclaimed 2002 Hong Kong thrillerInfernal Affairs, the film was intensely scrutinized by devoted critics and cinephiles, and while Scorsese's intense filmmaking and all-star cast deserve ample acclaim,The Departedis also worthy of serious re-assessment, especially with regard to what some attentive viewers described as sloppy craftsmanship (!), notably in terms of mismatched shots and jagged continuity. But no matter where you fall on the Scorsese appreciation scale, there's no denying thatThe Departedis a signature piece of work from one of America's finest directors, designed for maximum impact with a breathtaking series of twists, turns, and violent surprises. It's an intricate cat-and-mouse game, but this time the cat and mouse are both moles: Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) is an ambitious cop on the rise, planted in the Boston police force by criminal kingpin Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a hot-tempered police cadet who's been artificially disgraced and then planted into Costello's crime operation as a seemingly trustworthy soldier. As the multilayered plot unfolds (courtesy of a scorching adaptation byKingdom of Heavenscreenwriter William Monahan), Costigan and Sullivan conduct a volatile search for each other (they're essentially looking for \"themselves\") while simultaneously wooing the psychiatrist (Vera Farmiga) assigned to treat their crime-driven anxieties.Such convenient coincidences might sink a lesser film, butThe Departedis so electrifying that you barely notice the plot-holes. And while Nicholson's profane swagger is too much \"Jack\" and not enough \"Costello,\" he's still a joy to watch, especially in a film that's additionally energized by memorable (and frequently hilarious) supporting roles for Alec Baldwin, Mark Wahlberg, and a host of other big-name performers.The Departedalso makes clever and plot-dependent use of cell-phones, to the extent that it couldn't exist without them. Powered by Scorsese's trademark use of well-chosen soundtrack songs (from vintage rock to Puccini's operas),The Departedmay not be perfect, but it's one helluva ride for moviegoers, proving popular enough to become the biggest box-office hit of Scorsese's commercially rocky career.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002ZG99N6", "B000P0J09M", "B004SIP7TE", "B004SIP8ZM", "B002ZG980U", "B002VWNIEA", "B00011CZRE", "B00AEBB8NI", "B002T9H2LA", "B00005JLSB", "B000MZHW40", "B00080ZG10", "B003ASLJQS", "B000P0J0AG", "B000P0J0EW", "B000C20VPA", "B003UESJHO", "B004SIP7ZS", "B003ASLJO0", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B002CPMB9O", "B00AHTYI5M", "B00275EGWY", "B000XR9L50", "B000A3XY5A", "B0007DFJ0G", "B001N44BVQ", "B00003CXWV", "B008MILL8W", "B000286RP2", "B004SIP7VM", "B00005V9HH", "6305313687", "B00AEBB9NM", "B004FQX5B6", "B00AEFXKUI", "B004SIP95G", "B00AEBB86A", "B005LAIIJY", "B0016Q2D66", "B003ASLJQI", "B00008975Z", "B000IY04Q8", "B001P9KR8U", "B00005JNJV", "B000C20VRS", "B008R65XYC", "B005LAIGRS", "B00H9KKGTO", "B00008DP4C", "B00AEBB9F0", "B00AEFY5B6", "B00005JN0W", "B005LAIGLE", "B000A2UBN4", "B002QEHPQU", "B000P0J0EM", "B003UESJH4", "B007D5E7C2", "6304765258", "B000P0J0D8", "B00AEFY0XE", "B00004WG2F", "0767830555", "B000LC55F2", "B002O3Z4Y8", "B004EPYZP8", "B000A7DVR2", "B00005JPD0", "B000WZEZGI", "B00049QQHI", "B000FS9FCG", "B00004XPPB", "B006OFN0SE", "B009AMAL4Y", "B004U7MR14", "B000GFLKF8", "B003AWRMCE", "B0019L770A", "B00BEIYN9Q", "B0000AM6JI", "B004SIP9Z6", "B001GZ6QC4", "0783240295", "B0010DR4BO", "B000065U1N", "B00001ZWUS", "B00BB67UNW", "B0000B1OFL", "B00AEBB9K0", "B00DHDDE32", "B00005JKWX", "B0051MKNV8", "B002ZG97RE", "0767802519", "B0034G4P94", "B00DHHWXYY", "B00005B6JZ", "B00003CXZ4", "B001TODCII"], "bought_together": ["B000P0J09M"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000RETOHY", "B000P0J09M", "B000P0J0EW", "B00AEBB8NI"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 5067}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.5, "brand": "Warner Bros", "asin": "B000M341QE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RZnzpL34L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "Brilliantly conceived, superbly directed, and beautifully acted,Babelis inarguably one of the best films of 2006. Director Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu and his co-writer, Guillermo Arriaga (the two also collaborated onAmores Perrosand21 Grams) weave together the disparate strands of their story into a finely hewn fabric by focusing on what appear to be several equally incongruent characters: an American (Brad Pitt) touring Morocco with his wife (Cate Blanchett) become the focus of an international incident also involving a hardscrabble Moroccan farmer (Mustapha Rachidi) struggling to keep his two young sons in line and his family together. A San Diego nanny (Adriana Barraza), her employers absent, makes the disastrous decision to take their kids with her to a wedding in Mexico. And a deaf-mute Japanese teen (the extraordinary Rinko Kikuchi) deals with a relationship with her father (Koji Yakusho) and the world in general that's been upended by the death of her mother. It is perhaps not surprising, or particularly original, that a gun is the device that ties these people together. YetBabelisn't merely about violence and its tragic consequences. It's about communication, and especially the lack of it--both intercultural, raising issues like terrorism and immigration, and intracultural, as basic as husbands talking to their wives and parents understanding their children. I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu's command of his medium, sound and visual alike, is extraordinary; the camera work is by turns kinetic and restrained, the music always well matched to the scenes, the editing deft but not confusing, and the film (which clocks in at a lengthy 143 minutes) is filled with indelible moments. Many of those moments are also pretty stark and grim, and no will claim that all of this leads to a \"happy\" ending, but there is a sense of reconciliation, perhaps even resolution. \"If You Want to be Understood... Listen,\" goes the tagline. And if you want a movie that will leave you thinking,Babelis it.--Sam GrahamBeyondBabelOther Interweaving Storylines on DVDOther DVDs by Director Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rrituWhy We Love Cate BlanchettStills fromBabel(click for larger image)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0001CNRRU", "B00005N8A9", "B0041KKYF6", "B000A3XY5A", "B000F7CMRM", "B000067IZ3", "B00005JL57", "B00AEFXESQ", "B001P9KR8U", "B000N6TX1I", "B001JIE7JC", "B00005JPKE", "B00AEFXQ9S", "B00005JMJ4", "B0010DR4BO", "B000NIVJF4", "B000NIVJFY", "B000F1IQN2", "B00HF98SPS", "B0045ZAQRS", "B00011CZRE", "B000N3T0DW", "B002O3Z4Z2", "B000MZHW40", "B004SIP6VI", "B0034G4P30", "B008JFUNKU", "B003ASLJQS", "B000E1NXJ0", "B004SIP6GI", "B00AEBB89W", "B00275EGWY", "B000IONJM4", "B00H9KKGTO", "B00003CWTI", "B00080Z53O", "B00005JNCZ", "B00114XTHA", "B00GUO2SKA", "B00112S8RS", "B001PPLJIQ", "B000MXPE7O", "B00102F5WK", "B00121QGPY", "B0016Q2D66", "B002J1RZHE", "B008220DGE", "B000O76ZQC", "B0013XZ6X4", "B00080ZG10", "B00337KM2S", "B000286RP2", "B004SIP8ZM", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00005JMJG", "B00005Q4CS", "B00AEBB9CS", "B00G4Q3KOC", "B0036TGSJE", "B001TOD92C", "B000OY8NBK", "B004XVMCKS", "B00GMV8M2Y", "B00005JLRE", "B00005JH9M", "B00004WG2F", "B00AEBB8SS", "B00005JKJA", "B00H9HZITU", "B000YENUI6", "B0041KKYDI", "B001MZ5W3M", "B000N3SU92", "B000EQHXNW", "B0041KKYEM", "B001LLH8SE", "B0007TKOAA", "B000P0J0BK", "B002S5N052", "B004SIP7S0", "B00AEBB8NI", "B002SJIO4A", "B000CQLZ0Q", "B000E33VWW", "B000M341QE", "B002VWNICC", "B001NFNFNU", "6305313687", "B00005JKTF", "B00FZ4KR4U", "B00008K7AO", "B00DL48BM6", "079073639X", "B00H83EUQW", "B000FVQLRA", "B0002TT0MI", "B00AHTYI5M", "B00H9L26AA", "B00003CWRX", "B002FHGESI"], "bought_together": ["B00005N8A9", "B0041KKYF6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000A3XY5A", "B0001CNRRU", "B0041KKYF6", "B00G4Q3KOC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 100262}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.22, "brand": "Paramount Home Video", "asin": "B000MCH5P4", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51poif023LL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Babel"}
