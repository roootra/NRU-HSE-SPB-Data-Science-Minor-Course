{"description": "Confidently conceived and brilliantly executed,Gattacahad a somewhat low profile release in 1997, but audiences and critics hailed the film's originality. It's since been recognized as one of the most intelligent science fiction films of the 1990s. Writer-director Andrew Niccol, the talented New Zealander who also wrote the acclaimed Jim Carrey vehicleThe Truman Show, depicts a near-future society in which one's personal and professional destiny is determined by one's genes. In this society, \"Valids\" (genetically engineered) qualify for positions at prestigious corporations, such as Gattaca, which grooms its most qualified employees for space exploration. \"In-Valids\" (naturally born), such as the film's protagonist, Vincent (Ethan Hawke), are deemed genetically flawed and subsequently fated to low-level occupations in a genetically caste society. With the help of a disabled \"Valid\" (Jude Law), Vincent subverts his society's social and biological barriers to pursue his dream of space travel; any random mistake--and an ongoing murder investigation at Gattaca--could reveal his plot. Part thriller, part futuristic drama and cautionary tale,Gattacaestablishes its social structure so convincingly that the entire scenario is chillingly believable. With Uma Thurman as the woman who loves Vincent and identifies with his struggle,Gattacais both stylish and smart, while Jude Law's performance lends the film a note of tragic and heartfelt humanity.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEFYCW8", "B0001CNRAM", "B0069UP2PI", "B002GIBVVG", "B0018O4YT0", "B00005JL78", "B0001WTULW", "B00005JLWN", "B00003CXXP", "B0031SZER2", "B000VWX6TO", "0137135599", "1430218436", "0262514044", "B0001NBNDY", "B004EQAVHI", "B000006FQS", "B00A44GNTE", "B0006IIPIK", "B002ZG97J2", "B000056PMU", "B000Y7U98C", "B000JMK6LW", "B003XURDAY", "B002UZCJ8Y", "B000N6TX1I", "0470944889", "B00005JPAR", "B009YQJ322", "B0013LL2Z2", "B002QW7ALM", "B000XBPDYY", "B0007PALZ2", "B00005QAQH", "6305428506", "B000FS9FCG", "B004WCTLNY", "B004L9GMBC", "B002GHHHKQ", "0800195175", "0783233523", "B0087ZG7HK", "B00008438U", "B000MZGN40", "B000LC55F2", "1449319262", "B0017VG618", "B00005RDAN", "0783225733", "B00009ATIX", "0767821629", "B001MYIXAC", "0143037889", "B0016I0AJG", "B004LWZW7E", "B00GKOJ98E", "B0007DFJ0G", "B002ZG97CO", "B0043X1FL8", "630587493X", "B005LAIIHG", "B00000G02H", "B000KX0IOA", "B002ZG980U", "B00AEBB8SS", "B00AEFXPSK", "B00363WGHI", "B003ASLJQI", "B000ICL3KG", "B0001O3YV2", "B008JFUN50", "B00AEFXESQ", "B000000WF9", "B00B0U2SFE", "B00AEFY5B6", "B0002OXVBO", "B0041KKYEM", "B00AEFXCLU", "B000A7DVR2", "B000K7VHLY", "B00005JLSB", "B00005JMJG", "B00005B6JZ", "B002ZG98SW", "B000F5GNX8", "B00011D1OK", "B001HN69C2", "B0002CHIKG", "B00005JN0T", "B000AM6OQ2", "B0006A9FKA", "B004SIP6C2", "B0010YSD7M", "B0013D8LHM", "B00011CZRE", "B00008RH3J", "B002PLMJ74", "B004SIP6WW", "B00147F8WS"], "bought_together": ["B00AEFYCW8", "B0069UP2PI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000BO0LH2", "B0018O4YT0", "B000000WF9", "1424821029"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 10112}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 10.19, "brand": "", "asin": "0767805712", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51QM82SNT3L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Gattaca"}

But once on the reservation, Levoi encounters the irreverent local sheriff (Greene), and the tribe's religious leader (Chief Ted Thin Elk), who knows secrets about Levoi's own lost heritage.

His true story is both an action adventure and a spiritual journey through the heart of a warrior.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B007PXYWNQ", "0767812182", "B002DHACT2", "B004UOHNIY", "B000GAKNTC", "B00337DRGQ", "B0001I55YW", "B00CLH09JM", "B0001FVDI2", "B001UW59JO", "B004AOECXI", "B0002J4X2K", "B000087F0X", "B0002S65WC", "B000GFRI4K", "B005HIBWPM", "B00005221M", "B004XWGZK0", "B00003L9BB", "B00005OSJN", "B000A2WP7O", "B000056H2G", "B0016OLXN2", "B000AQ6A9E", "B003Y7F1OG", "B0008ENHUS", "B000ELJ3E4", "B000UL61KW", "B000G6N0HI", "B0046ZYEU2", "B0025Z4Q3U", "B00CS7GYF8", "0803218842", "B00083FZFY", "B00006FDA4", "B00019330O", "B000BNTM9G", "B000OT6V0U", "B003XMKU48", "B000E5N6LG", "B0000D0YWJ", "B000EHSVUU", "B00003CXB5", "B000O599NA", "B00116GEJS", "B00005LOL2", "B001LRJH0U", "6305504024", "6305428417", "B000EOTUSA", "B001N5BDX4", "B009B6XJVQ", "B00AEFYPHA", "B00008MTW5", "B000NQRR34", "B000QRI1GW", "B00015YVPO", "B000O599NK", "B004ULEEUM", "B00AEFYL6K", "0671885561", "6304711905", "B000056H2J", "B0000TANUI", "B00AEFY4IA", "B00BTYPW8G", "B0007MAO0C", "B00005LOL0", "B001VC99HQ", "B0002DRDBY", "B00006672R", "B0018O4RT2", "B00IMRL4BC", "1849086303", "B0038EGD3I", "B000ANVPP6", "B001D7T6BI", "0806127708", "B0007UDC80", "B00AEFXFW6", "B000274TJ4", "B000059H7K", "B0009ETCYW", "B0007OY2NA", "B000XR9L50", "B00005JK8K", "B00008CMR5", "6304696612", "B0082LUFA4", "B00A92MD8G", "B00008MTW7", "B001LMAK88", "0300126387", "B000059TFU", "B00013F34Y", "B00004TJJU", "B003AWRMCE", "B000ION22Q", "B0000029H6", "B000BT96DC"], "bought_together": ["B00337DRGQ", "B007PXYWNQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000F48D3M", "B001D7T6BI", "B000GFRI4K", "B00CQ9VEDK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 37648}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 39.99, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "0767817672", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RGJ1YDVXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Geronimo - An American Legend"}
{"description": "Shot in English and budgeted higher than any of his previous  Asian features, Jackie Chan's last film under his Hong Kong contract is an  action-packed globe-trotting adventure shot with the American audience  in mind. The spies and secret agent-laden plot is packed with car chases,  explosions, gunfire aplenty, and of course Jackie's own brand of gymnastic martial arts. But the flood of his older films between his hitsRumble in the BronxandRush Hourhad sated American viewers andWho Am I?wound  up being sold directly to cable. It's our loss, for this mix of goofy slapstick and jaw-dropping action is his most impressive film sinceDrunken Master II. Playing a special forces agent (named, naturally, Jackie) struck with amnesia and adopted  by an African bush tribe following a failed assassination attempt, he  embarks on a quest to discover his true identity while armies of killers pour  after him. After an explosive opening, the story gets momentarily bogged down  in the kind of mugging humor that leaves most American audiences  scratching their heads, but once Jackie kicks into gear the film is a high-speed action flurry that culminates in a furious battle atop a Rotterdam skyscraper. Jackie is at his most charmingly naive (he berates the villains, pleading \"Why do you want to destroy when you can make things better?\") and athletically impressive: the marvelous stunts--including a flight down  the side of the skyscraper--and fight choreography makeRush Hourlook like a Sunday drive.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000I2KOB0", "0780619331", "B004U7MR1O", "0767851161", "B000006A17", "0780622677", "B006LOC01G", "B00005YUNV", "B000EWBKIK", "078062260X", "B004SUDQAY", "B00005JL8Z", "B000HC2M3Y", "B00AWHDEIQ", "B000Y11BC6", "B0000SX9N2", "B000UXOM88", "B000BVM1QO", "B0002S64TQ", "B00AWHDFIA", "B000UNYK3U", "B0051SFTGQ", "B004SIP8TS", "B00H4KQMX8", "B002ZG99M2", "B005CFBZFW", "B00HVFA37C", "B00004XMRY", "B000KX0IMW", "B004SUDQ7W", "B000Q7ZKWK", "B002NPY7EA", "B004SUDQ4K", "B005M2AKIS", "B000VUDSH6", "B004SUDPZU", "B004TJWDNA", "B001BEK8HO", "B004SUDQCC", "B004H83IOQ", "B00HVFA322", "B00BNADY8Q", "B000WGYMTC", "B0000TPA2E", "B004SNJ08S", "B00005JLRQ", "B0000640VF", "B005ZMBEXU", "B00003CXJ1", "B005ZMBEXA", "B00008WJE4", "B009INAMEY", "B00008IHUC", "B0001NBMOY", "B00IS402HQ", "B001BEK8GA", "B004TP55XY", "B002GSXKO2", "B009INAEI8", "B003EVAG4C", "B00000F2MG", "B00006672Q", "B00003CY5A", "B005FQ1OOK", "B000I0RNWU", "B004QDW2DA", "B002ZG99MC", "B0051SFS6C", "B003Q7B79M", "B000A2IPQY", "B008WAM2BU", "B004GJYRKA", "B0009VBTQY", "B0080QOL0Q", "B004U7MR0K", "B00ATKH6KS", "B004P8R9O8", "B00D9EJG5E", "B00HSJ2EMI", "B00003CY5Y", "B00JVQ7RCS", "B0000U0X1Q", "B000LC4Z7Q", "B000OT6V64", "0767804252", "B004SO0HMU", "B003INBNXO", "1558908846", "B004SUDPWS", "B000GFLKDU", "B000AYEL3I", "B0018PH3NS", "1558908412", "B00C7E3E96", "B004XVMCPI", "B0000V46DQ", "B00005OOQ1", "0345415035", "B000A9QK9Q", "B00C7E3EBE"], "bought_together": ["0780619331", "B004U7MR1O"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004U7MR1O", "0780619331", "B006LOC01G", "B00005YUNV"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 33641}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.99, "brand": "COL", "asin": "0767819640", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HQ0TADYQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Who Am I?"}

The documentary, however, seems like an afterthought after Columbia's stellar work on theBig ChillCollector's Edition.

{"description": "This smart, tautly directed thriller from Wolfgang Petersen is about the cat-and-mouse games between a Secret Service agent named Horrigan (Clint Eastwood) and the brilliant, psychopathic assassin (John Malkovich) who's itching to get the President in his cross hairs. The back-story--Horrigan is haunted by his inability to prevent John Kennedy's assassination (Eastwood is computer-generated into archival footage)--is more than a little hokey, but the plotting itself is smartly, even ingeniously, constructed. Petersen manages a viselike grip on the tension and Eastwood even gets to deliver an ever-more-timely lecture on the diminished nature of the office of President. Eastwood's as gruff and as infuriating to the by-the-book Powers That Be as ever, and Malkovich oozes delightful menace.

{"description": "Criterion's release of Carl Dreyer's landmark filmThe Passion of Joan of Arcis a definitive example of DVD restoration. Initially believed to be lost forever in a fire, this transfer was created at 24 frames per second from a negative of the rediscovered original version. For a film released in 1928,The Passion of Joan of Arclooks absolutely remarkable. As with most silent films, Dreyer'sJoanwas originally presented to audiences with different pieces of music. Criterion has chosen composer Richard Einhorn'sVoices of Lightfor this edition. Inspired by the film, Einhorn's piece, presented in 5.1 surround sound, is a wonderful compliment to Dreyer's visual presentation.   Notable extras include a history of the film's many versions and an audio interview with Renee Falconetti's daughter. However, by far the best \"extra\" is Dreyer scholar Casper Tybjerg's incredible commentary that informatively combines rich details of the film's importance and content with known historical elements of St. Joan's life, trial and death.--Rob Bracco", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000029NX", "B00005M2C7", "B00180R06I", "B00092ZLEY", "6305131104", "B00005JLV7", "6305257450", "B00005BHW6", "B000HT3QBO", "B0002DCHQA", "B000BB14IA", "B005HK13S6", "6305744114", "B00005O5CA", "B0000A02TX", "B000V7HFL4", "B0001UZWMU", "B005152C7S", "6305081034", "B00007CVS8", "B00006JMQG", "B0007989Y8", "B00HE011DE", "B001298BPY", "B001CD6HQA", "B001M9ELJY", "B00EO2I6W4", "B005HK13OK", "B000BB14I0", "B00000JS6F", "B00005UQ7T", "B001WLMOL4", "B00005QAPH", "B000E5LEV0", "B0056ANHCC", "B00005EBSF", "0780021541", "B000VUQ4HW", "0767845722", "B00065GX64", "B00GG0NABE", "B00006JMQH", "B006X96PBU", "B008CJ0JS4", "B0009WIE2U", "B0040QYROA", "B002U6DVQ2", "B000I8OOG0", "B001LMU1C8", "B00J2PQZRQ", "B000093NR0", "B004WPYO7E", "B00005NC66", "B002E01MBA", "B00004XQN5", "B000093NQZ", "B0007989ZC", "B00HVOFP08", "B00BX49B0C", "B000ZM1MIM", "B000AQKUG8", "1885983085", "B000BR6QIW", "B000EU1OXI", "B000FS9FLW", "B000N2HBIO", "B00005UQ7Q", "B0036SPDEG", "B00HE010LC", "B00AQ6J5YA", "B00J5LXMTG", "B00D9BNONW", "B00005JKPT", "B0002V7O0Q", "B00HVOFP6W", "B000PKG6O4", "B0002JP2OS", "B0026VBOJW", "B0000B1O9L", "B00005JLMU", "B001LMU19G", "B0012KHTEC", "B0001UZZS6", "0780020707", "B005152CC8", "B00393SFU2", "B004NWPY20", "B007N5YJPC", "B00005QW58", "B0035ECI0I", "B0000633SD", "B000127IF2", "B003WKL6YO", "B000305ZYS", "B00GRA7M2G", "B001MPS7GG", "B00064AEWY", "B00004Z1FM", "B000NOK0H6", "B004NWPY3E"], "bought_together": ["B0000029NX"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00000JS6F", "B0000029NX", "0767845722", "6305999872"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 49803}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 25.9, "brand": "DREYER,CARL", "asin": "0780022343", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4154H8KT15L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Passion of Joan of Arc (The Criterion Collection)"}

Cary Grant is the stranger who comes to her aid, but his real motives aren't entirely clear--could he even be the killer? The 1963 film is directed by Stanley Donen, but it has been called \"Hitchcockian\" for good reason: the possible duplicities between lovers, the unspoken agendas between a man and woman sharing secrets.Charadeis nowhere as significant as a Hitchcock film, but suspense-wise it holds its own; and Donen's glossy production lends itself to the welcome experience of stargazing. One wants Cary Grant to be Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn to be no one but Audrey Hepburn in a Hollywood product such as this, and they certainly don't let us down.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEBB97S", "B0045HCJ9E", "B004IK30KA", "B00005ALMH", "B00009NHC5", "B00AEBB8OC", "B00AMEZDK6", "B00BTYU3ZS", "B000AP04MO", "B00AEFY8ZE", "B0002B15YM", "B001D8W7EK", "B00C3ALLFS", "B00AEFXLBQ", "B00871C09S", "B000WTVZHQ", "B004I1K066", "B002HK9IDQ", "B0045HCJHG", "B0002HOEQ2", "B000CCW2TS", "B00CZ7AL32", "B00A1AU6ZI", "B00006JU7S", "B000E1MXSW", "B00005JL6M", "B002GSXKQA", "B0045HCJQW", "B002TSAAME", "B000GI3RMY", "B004GJYR7I", "B00AEFXD1O", "B00K6J7Q1Q", "B00008MTYC", "B002VWNIAY", "B00C3ALLSA", "B001D8W7F4", "B0087ZG7R0", "B008CZDVUQ", "B008D1Q1VU", "B0009HLD3C", "B0045HCJQM", "B002LVF2H2", "B000CCW2UC", "B00AATV046", "B0001WTWS8", "B000JJSJPK", "B000059ZTM", "B000085EFE", "B000KIX8VK", "B0000549B0", "B003ZEQMH8", "B000P2A22O", "B000FFJYAW", "B000ION7AI", "B001KXZGNW", "B001D8W7EU", "B00007GZR1", "B000FFJYA2", "B0002B15Y2", "B0000DD77W", "B00000C0QO", "B0049985XW", "B00347AIS0", "B00IOFMZYM", "B0000DD77V", "B002BZX0JK", "B000CCW2UW", "B00AEFYRJQ", "B0015FGCI8", "B0001WTWVU", "B000ECX0S8", "B000A9QK7I", "B0048O1SLO", "B004I1K05C", "B000CCW2U2", "B001FBNQYA", "B004I1K05W", "B0087ZG7PW", "B0045HCJJY", "B000CEV3L4", "B000FZETR0", "B0002ERWZ0", "B000ECX0O2", "B00005JL3W", "0767821556", "B000056BOR", "B005H8G78O", "B000W089XS", "B000H6SXS8", "B0001WTWXS", "B0010AN7Z4", "B000ANVPPQ", "B000JF5TXO", "B00006L92W", "B001ECDVK4", "B0087ZG7OI", "B00347AIMG", "B001TKUXVQ", "6305999872"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AEBB97S", "B0045HCJ9E", "B00AMEZDK6", "B00BTYU3ZS"]}, "price": 11.4, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 102471}, "asin": "0780022300", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/711AP5CVCSL._SY300_.gif", "title": "Charade (The Criterion Collection)"}

{"description": "Jackie Chan finally conquered America withRumble in the Bronx. If the mildly contorted English dialogue sounds peculiarly foreign and disembodied (most of it is dubbed), and the mountains of Vancouver, BC don't convincingly double for the skyline of New York City, well, peculiarities like these actually contribute something to the movie's ingenuous charm. With his disarming smile and feline physicality, the compact Chan radiates star quality. But there's more to him than charisma: at his best, the actor combines the relentlessly escalating, hyperkinetic action set-pieces for which Hong Kong is famous; the rigorous martial arts training of his idol, Bruce Lee; and the grace and daring that distinguish Buster Keaton's physical comedy. Chan also shares some of Keaton's cinematic integrity, which dictated that you shouldn't cheat the audience by faking stunts, on the set or in the editing room. Like Keaton, Chan does his own stunts, and you can see that it really is him jumping off a bridge onto a speeding boat, or clinging to the dangling ladder of a helicopter as the hostile pilot tries to shake him loose by smashing him into the sides of skyscrapers. Not that it matters, really, but the plot ofRumble in the Bronxhas something to do with Chan helping the woman who has taken over his uncle's neighborhood market when she is harassed by local hoodlums. What really matters is Chan, and he's in fine form.Rumble in the Bronxdoesn't rank with his best work, but it's a swell introduction to a unique star. And those stunt outtakes over the end credits are as delightfully spellbinding as ever. &quot;See?&quot; Chan seems to say every time he breaks a rib or twists an ankle (which happens often). &quot;I'm doing this all for you.&quot;--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000I2KOB0", "0767819640", "B004U7MR1O", "0780622677", "B00005YUNV", "B006LOC01G", "B004SUDQAY", "B000006A17", "B00AWHDEIQ", "0767851161", "B00005JL8Z", "078062260X", "B000EWBKIK", "B004SIP8TS", "B00H4KQMX8", "B000HC2M3Y", "B000Y11BC6", "B0000SX9N2", "B000UXOM88", "B00HVFA37C", "B001BEK8HO", "B004TP55XY", "B0051SFTGQ", "B000UNYK3U", "B004SUDQ7W", "B002NPY7EA", "B00D9EJG5E", "B000VUDSH6", "B0002S64TQ", "B002ZG99M2", "B000BVM1QO", "B00BNADY8Q", "B004SNJ08S", "B004SUDQCC", "B004SUDQ4K", "B004TJWDNA", "B004SUDPZU", "B004GJYRKA", "B000Q7ZKWK", "B005CFBZFW", "B00AWHDFIA", "B004SUDPWS", "B00008IHUC", "B008WAM2BU", "B000KX0IMW", "B004U7MR0K", "B004H83IOQ", "B00008WJE4", "B000OT6V64", "B00003CXJ1", "B005M2AKIS", "B00003CY5Y", "B000K2UW06", "B00003CY5A", "B0009VBTQY", "B00006RCOC", "B000WGYMTC", "B002GSXKO2", "B000LC4Z7Q", "B00005JLRQ", "B003EVAG4C", "B005ZMBEXU", "B001L2ZSJO", "B00C7E3E96", "B0016MJ6JC", "B00C7E3EBE", "B004SIP88Y", "B0045HCJGC", "B000GFLKDU", "0783226985", "B00016MSV2", "B000A2IPQY", "B0001NBMOY", "B003INBNXO", "B00376AVIK", "B0080QOL0Q", "0783228465", "B0000640VF", "B000N4SHNK", "B005FQ1OOK", "B005K8RJNS", "B00005OOQ1", "B0015RCUR8", "B002XTXGA2", "B004I1AGTC", "B00005N89J", "B005ZMBEXA", "B005KK2FWG", "B004JXCR64", "B000VSDN2I", "B00008EY6M", "B001BEK8GA", "B0036BDQLA", "B008NP4ZUU", "B009Z4AAK2", "B009INAEI8", "B001L67A4G", "B002TVQ4CG", "B000X1Z0CO", "B000I0RNWU"], "bought_together": ["0767819640", "B000I2KOB0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004U7MR1O", "B000I2KOB0", "B001BEK8HO", "B00388PK88"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 20307}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.81, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "0780619331", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51PZZ0A9TCL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Rumble in the Bronx"}
{"description": "Zero Effectfollows private investigator Daryl Zero and Steve Arlo, his reluctant representative, through one particularly tangled case involving blackmail, murder, revenge, and a set of lost keys. Zero is the world's best private investigator, suave and totally in control while on a case, but socially inept when off the job. The diversely talented and prolific Bill Pullman is excellently cast as Zero, switching seamlessly from one persona to the next, and the ever-charming Ben Stiller is his perfect sidekick. In a deadpan description of his method, or the \"Zero Effect,\" Zero details his brilliance for Sherlock Holmes-like deductions, based on his strict adherence to objectivity and observation, or, in Zero parlance, \"the obs.\" Somewhat predictably the obs falter when the case of the missing keys brings Zero to Gloria Sullivan, a winsome and mysterious paramedic played by Kim Dickens. Thankfully, writer-director Jake Kasdan is no less brilliant than the Zero he creates, and the potential corniness of the developing romance is balanced by a razor-sharp wit and the nail-biting suspense of the unfolding plot.--Laska Jimsen", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 414877}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.95, "brand": "", "asin": "0780623215", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51QJVHC6TFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Zero Effect [VHS]"}
{"description": "Although it received mixed reactions from critics and audiences alike when released in 1998, this supernatural thriller benefits from a sustained atmosphere of anticipation and dread, and its combination of detective mystery and demonic mischief is handled with ample style and intelligence. Under the direction of Gregory Hoblit (who fared better withPrimal Fear), Denzel Washington plays detective John Hobbes, who witnesses the gas-chamber execution of a serial killer (Elias Koteas). But when another series of murders begins, Hobbes suspects that the killer's evil spirit has survived and is possessing the bodies of others to do its evil bidding. Even Hobbes's trusted partner (John Goodman) thinks the detective is losing his grip on reality, but the dire warnings of a noted linguist (Embeth Davidtz) confirm Hobbes's far-out theory, and his case intensifies toward a fateful showdown. Although its idea is better than its execution, and the story's film noir ambitions are never fully accomplished, this slickly directed thriller has some genuinely effective moments in which evil forces are entwined into the fabric of everyday reality. Among the highlights is a memorable scene in which Detective Hobbes must track the killer as the evil spirit is transferred between many people via physical contact. Even if the film is ultimately less than the sum of its parts, it's an intriguing hybrid that resides in the same cinematic neighborhood asSevenandThe Silence of the Lambswith a cast that also includes Donald Sutherland and James Gandolfini.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783240295", "6304884400", "B00BTYOYG2", "6305065551", "B000OT6V0K", "B00005JPD0", "B000244GCC", "B00011CZRE", "6304765258", "B002NZK5UU", "B00441GZ1Y", "B0006210ZG", "B002LMV7R0", "B0000VJG72", "B002NZK5RI", "B00005JN0W", "B000GFLKF8", "B0001VTPUO", "B0000542CJ", "B000069HZP", "B00096S49Y", "B002ZG997C", "B00005JKWX", "B00005JA9F", "B00006AUJR", "078324228X", "0800141806", "6305718954", "B00AEFXEGS", "B00AEFXT1S", "B0002DB54A", "B00AEFXX9Q", "B001R3YRG2", "B00AFEXRME", "B0009MDPYM", "B0000549B2", "B002VWNIEA", "B005LAIGRS", "B002O3Z4WK", "0767818075", "B00HOGBXS6", "B00BEIYN9Q", "B002AT8KAG", "B00AP2DC94", "B00AEFYF2K", "630514415X", "B000NQRR1Q", "B0001FR3IQ", "B00013RC7K", "B002ZG99TA", "B003BV8I3Q", "B00AEBB8LA", "B002CPMB9O", "B00009WVSL", "0767836286", "B00AEBBA2W", "B000R4SMCW", "B00005JNY3", "B00015YVDG", "B00026ZD04", "B0000648X0", "B002NZK5VO", "6305310335", "B00GS08UDU", "0800177789", "6305428115", "B0034G4P30", "0767817737", "B0045HCJ0S", "B00005Y1UV", "B000P0I4O4", "B00004BZIY", "0783230532", "B001UDS4BS", "6304698747", "B003UGLCIA", "B00005V9HH", "B00005LDDD", "B002AS466O", "0800177967", "B00008L3S6", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00005UQ9W", "0792846443", "B002O3Z4Y8", "B009IV2Z7S", "B00AEBB95K", "B002AS464Q", "B00005JLRZ", "B002T9H2LA", "B00003CWU3", "B001N44BVQ", "B000TGJ80S", "B0001US62I", "B003AWRMCE", "0780618548", "B00JA3RVG4", "B00AEBB89W", "B000P0J0EM"], "bought_together": ["0783240295", "B00011CZRE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0050MB4OO", "B000NA1WEK", "6305065551", "B00005JN0W"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 118059}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 20.25, "brand": "TURNER HM ENTERTAINM", "asin": "0780622537", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71Q7T9SZ5HL._SY300_.gif", "title": "Fallen (Snap Case Packaging)"}

{"description": "After building up the duo's popularity through popular recordings and several performances onSaturday Night Live,John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd--as \"legendary\" Chicago blues brothers Jake and Elwood Blues--took their act to the big screen in this action-packed hit from 1980. As Jake and Elwood struggle to reunite their old band and save the Chicago orphanage where they were raised, they wreak enough good-natured havoc to attract the entire Cook County police force. The result is a big-budget stunt-fest on a scale rarely attempted before or since, including extended car chases that result in the wanton destruction of shopping malls and more police cars than you can count. Along the way there's plenty of music to punctuate the action, including performances by Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin, Cab Calloway, and James Brown that are guaranteed to knock you out. As played with deadpan wit by Belushi and Aykroyd, the Blues Brothers are \"on a mission from God,\" and that gives them a kind of reckless glee that keeps the movie from losing its comedic appeal. Otherwise this might have been just a bloated marathon of mayhem that quickly wears out its welcome (which is how some critics described this film and its 1998 sequel). Keep an eye out for Steven Spielberg as the city clerk who stamps some crucial paperwork near the end of the film.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783227078", "6300182150", "B000005PFL", "0800198395", "6302877881", "6301569385", "6300989003", "630220366X", "6305576173", "B000006N70", "6304071876", "6301300394", "B00005Q4GY", "6301971809", "630281622X", "0800132009", "B0000068ZQ", "6305363668", "B00005RRG6", "6301697294", "6304196954", "0783202253", "6300181987", "6301208773", "6302032377", "0800116917", "6304107250", "6303168507", "0766202771", "0783235607", "6300246965", "B000077VT7", "6302909023", "630150528X", "6304155972", "B000005QWI", "B000007PI9", "630470786X", "6300214567", "6303057225", "0792839846", "B00000JGEK"], "bought_together": ["0783227078"], "also_viewed": ["6300182150", "B000005PFL", "B00000JKNP", "B00003CXCQ", "B00G5G7EXY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 240790}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.98, "brand": "", "asin": "0783225199", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41BZ5ANGQ2L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Blues Brothers [VHS]"}

{"description": "Suffering from the extreme bad luck of being released at the same time as the low-budgetThe Blair Witch Project, this adaptation ofThe Haunting of Hill Houseattempts to update Shirley Jackson's psychologically terrifying ghost story to the era of big-budget, computerized special effects. Does it work? Well, let's just say that showing isn't exactly the same as telling. A prime example of bloated studio filmmaking,The Hauntingtelegraphs all its frights so blatantly that it forsakes any of Jackson's subtle horrors for the remedial scares of a clunky carnival ride. The story remains basically the same, with four people called to an old mansion for experiments in the supernatural, but instead of getting inside the heads of its main characters (as the 1963 adaptation by Robert Wise did so well), Jan DeBont's film deserts character development for the huge, glorious set design provided by Eugenio Zanetti (Restoration). Thus, instead of a well-drawn story you get... a well-drawn house, one that four very talented and underutilized actors--Lili Taylor, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Liam Neeson, and Owen Wilson--wander around in endlessly (as Zeta-Jones puts it, the house is \"sort of Charles Foster Kane meets the Munsters\"). Taylor, as the hypersensitive Nell, is the unknowing lynchpin in the battle between good and bad ghosts and gets saddled with most of the expository dialogue of the mansion's gothic backstory. Zeta-Jones (showing some spark) and Neeson (showing none) are sadly reduced to providing reactionary shots of the film's disastrous climax, which mixes hapless new-age affirmations with computer-generated effects of ghosts and exploding windows, walls, doors, etc. For this haunted-house story, take a quick tour of the breathtaking rooms, but definitelydon'tstay the night.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00003CWRF", "B00005UQ9W", "B0045HCJJE", "B000063US5", "B003VA3JUO", "B002AS45VK", "B00AEBBA2W", "B0000C2IQQ", "B00005LIRD", "B002GHHHL0", "B00AEBBA72", "B00K2CHY1Y", "078322799X", "B004SIP92O", "B000V4UFZK", "B00AEFYXQI", "B00BEIYMAG", "B000CCBC9O", "B001BSBBGC", "B00E32PJ02", "B0000AOX0D", "B000UUX2Z0", "B000HC2LFI", "B0021L8UFI", "B00009PY4G", "0767824954", "B0010X73ZG", "B00AEBB91E", "0800177029", "B00AEFYYH6", "B0008191WO", "B00000IQVQ", "B00008LUNW", "B00003CXKM", "6305718954", "B00005JNY3", "B0002DB54A", "B004LWZW24", "B002VWNIDG", "B00DBNLBAQ", "0783116926", "B000GBEWRU", "0783225482", "B00AIBZLVY", "B004AC6PV2", "B0001FR3IQ", "B000GCFO0I", "B000NOIVT0", "B001B1872U", "B004P7CNUY", "B00004BZIY", "B00005JNBN", "B0009X763M", "B000NQRR1Q", "B00006FDCD", "B000AM6OQ2", "B00005O5B5", "0792839684", "B0000694XX", "B00000JQB5", "0780622650", "6305017115", "B003498SCQ", "1573625779", "B001B8XRT6", "B00000IQC4", "B00AEFXPMG", "6305300801", "B00EZ50SGW", "B00006AUIG", "B000TJ6PBK", "B0006SGYL0", "B004SIP9MY", "B001P3SA9Y", "B00023P4TM", "6305090564", "B000AM4P9K", "B00JPS7HOA", "B00B96TGQS", "B003UGLCIA", "B005LAIGOQ", "B004SIP9O2", "B00DZP1C9K", "B000ARXF96", "B004LWZW2O", "6305767866", "B002945DUW", "B000RIWAVW", "B000FFJYBG", "B00005JOWW", "B005TK23PQ", "B004XVMCN0", "B009XTF8KQ", "B001CFEC2Y", "B00006IUFV", "B00317LM8S", "B0021L8UPS", "B008874968", "6305428042", "B008JFUS0U"], "bought_together": ["B000063US5"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00BTYXNRI", "B0045HCJJE", "B000ASATYO", "0783116926"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 18281}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.84, "brand": "Dreamworks Skg", "asin": "0783237413", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51aYQx70GGL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Haunting"}

{"description": "Martin Scorsese's 1990 masterpieceGoodFellasimmortalizes the hilarious, horrifying life of actual gangster Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), from his teen years on the streets of New York to his anonymous exile under the Witness Protection Program. The director's kinetic style is perfect for recounting Hill's ruthless rise to power in the 1950s as well as his drugged-out fall in the late 1970s; in fact, no one has ever rendered the mental dislocation of cocaine better than Scorsese. Scorsese uses period music perfectly, not just to summon a particular time but to set a precise mood.GoodFellasis at least as good asThe Godfatherwithout being in the least derivative of it. Joe Pesci's psycho improvisation of Mobster Tommy DeVito ignited Pesci as a star, Lorraine Bracco scores the performance of her life as the love of Hill's life, and every supporting role, from Paul Sorvino to Robert De Niro, is a miracle.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000C20VPA", "B000C20VRS", "B008R65XYC", "B000M341QE", "B0018CMJSU", "B0019L770A", "B0019L21GA", "B00004XPPB", "B000P0J0AG", "B0000DI87S", "B000P0J0EW", "B00003CXWV", "B00CCMKPO0", "B00G1C2URC", "B00004U103", "B00AEBB9NM", "B004SIP95G", "B002CPMB9O", "B0019L21H4", "B007TBIUSM", "B000286RP2", "B00011CZRE", "B004SIP8ZM", "B0006GAOJA", "B002T9H2LA", "B006TTC5HC", "B002VWNIEA", "0767830555", "B0000AMJEK", "B0000AM6JI", "B00005V9HH", "B004FQX5B6", "B000SFOW8I", "B00008975Z", "B002CA68N4", "6305313687", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00013RC2U", "0792174909", "B007D0FVRM", "B000A7DVR2", "B004G7XCRQ", "B002QEHPQU", "B003ASLJO0", "B000LP6KNU", "B000H5TH20", "B000P0J09C", "6305263248", "0783229526", "B00009W5CA", "B001C0I61M", "B000EHSVRI", "B00IEK9U0E", "B002ZG980U", "B004SIP7TE", "B004SIP7ZS", "B0006GAO5Y", "B00B0U2SFE", "B000ERVKBC", "B000A2UBN4", "B002AF4Y9G", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B0000714BS", "B000E5KQHI", "B00005JA8B", "B002O3Z4Y8", "B003AWRMCE", "B000P0J0EM", "1558908390", "B00080ZG10", "0767802519", "B003ELKNH2", "B003BV8I3Q", "B000035Z5G", "B00AEFXDO6", "B000E8NRBC", "B00000JGHV", "B00004RJ71", "B00AEBB9CS", "B004SIP93S", "B00AEFYSEA", "B004SIP6WW", "B003ASLJQS", "B0001Z4OXS", "B002VWNIDG", "0783225946", "B00AEBB9ZK", "B00AEFXXMI", "B0000A02TZ", "B000MZHW40", "B004SIP6GI", "B002ZG99N6", "B00AEBB95K", "B00AEFXP8K", "B00BB67UNW", "B00029RTAI", "B000P0J0D8", "B003ASLJOU", "B000Z8GZYW", "B003ASLJS6"], "bought_together": ["B000C20VPA", "B000C20VRS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000M341QE", "B0018CMJSU", "B000P0J0EW", "B00BCB1JJW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 120285}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.49, "brand": "WARNER STUDIOS", "asin": "0790729725", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41YHNBJW24L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "GoodFellas"}
{"description": "Some of us will never understand why this boy-and-his-whale tale became the hit family film of 1993 and one of the bestselling videos of all time. But it is easy to see how clever marketing and a tear-jerking story could touch the hearts of kids and parents the world over, especially because the endangered Orca whale named Willy is such a majestic creature. The story couldn't be more conventional--it's likeOld YellerandThe Black Stallionwith a big sea mammal--but as the boy who comes to Willy's aid against the whale's exploitative owner, young Jason James Richter gives an appealing performance with which children can readily identify. After two sequels and an animated television series, this popular film also had a happy real-life ending: Keiko the whale (who plays Willy) recovered from failing health and was gradually trained to survive outside of captivity.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0790732580", "6303696929", "0790720434", "6303314015", "0788812807", "B00004ZES5", "6302914469", "B00005JMQY", "B00008X5J8", "6302642205", "6303106641", "6302091632", "6303446590", "B00006G8LB", "B00005LL26", "6303148352", "6301440056", "6303614493", "B000028U3S", "0792168313", "0800197674", "6303952763", "B00005RDVV", "6305093016", "6302518393", "6303450849", "B00003CXXI", "B0002F6BQU", "6303224407", "6304434340", "B00004TWZK", "B00006HBUC", "080019683X", "B00001IVFU", "0783230095"], "bought_together": ["0790732580", "6303696929"], "also_viewed": ["6303696929", "B003PIUIHE", "0790732580", "B0037RP0OO", "6302481805", "0783229011", "B00005O5ML", "B00004TJTQ", "B00005LL26", "6302914469", "6303326781", "6304434340", "0790748266", "B00005LOUS", "6304089767", "0790725657", "6303915655", "B00006HBUC", "B00001IVED", "6303506291", "6303392350", "B00003CXI0", "B000GUJZ00", "B000HT38A8", "155890641X", "6303212379", "630305899X", "B00000JKNP", "6303148387", "6304500831", "6303314015", "B00007G1ZA", "0790741466", "6302787068", "1560395966", "B0007KTBIU", "0788812181", "6303614493"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 56260}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.99, "brand": "", "asin": "0790719029", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51M18BNZSDL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Free Willy [VHS]"}
{"description": "The most viscerally frightening and disturbing homicidal-maniac picture sinceThe Silence of the Lambs,Sevenis based on an idea that's both gruesome and ingenious. A serial killer forces each of his victims to die by acting out one of the seven deadly sins. The murder scene is then artfully arranged into a grotesque tableau, a graphic illustration of each mortal vice. From the jittery opening credits to the horrifying (and seemingly inescapable) concluding twist, director David Fincher immerses us in a murky urban twilight where everything seems to be rotting, rusting, or molding; the air is cold and heavy with dread. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt are the detectives who skillfully track down the killer--all the while unaware that he has been closing in on them, as well. Gwyneth Paltrow and Kevin Spacey are also featured, but it is director Fincher and the ominous, overwhelmingly oppressive atmosphere of doom that he creates that are the real stars of the film. It's a terrific date movie--for vampires.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005V9HH", "B0007DFJ0G", "B000M341QE", "0783240295", "B00003CXZ4", "6305313687", "B004SIP8ZM", "B000P0J0EW", "B000LP6KNU", "B000P0J09M", "B000P0J0AG", "B000069HZP", "B004SIP95G", "B0009A40ES", "B0007PALZ2", "B002NZK5RI", "B002AF4Y9G", "B00AEBB89W", "B004SIP7VM", "B00AEFXQ9S", "B00004BZIY", "B003ASLJO0", "B00003CXWV", "B00096S49Y", "B00AEFYF2K", "B004SIP7ZS", "B00AEBB8NI", "B00008975Z", "B002T9H2LA", "B00005JLKN", "B000LC55F2", "0767802519", "B004FQX5B6", "B002VWNIEA", "B004SIP7TE", "B004SIP9Z6", "B00AEFXEGS", "0792846435", "B00003CXSP", "B002VWNICC", "B00AEFXT1S", "B000C20VPA", "B00AEFXESQ", "B000P0J0EM", "B000093FLA", "B002ZG99N6", "B002NZK5VO", "B003LR5BD0", "B002VWNIDG", "B000I2J736", "B0001FR3IQ", "B00AEFYYH6", "B000F5GNX8", "B002ZG980U", "B00005JN0W", "B00005JMJG", "B0000AC8LR", "B003ASLJQI", "B000E5N684", "B002XMGGK6", "B003HKN52U", "B00AP2DC94", "B00001ZWUS", "B000A2UBN4", "B000244GCW", "B000A7DVR2", "B002GHHHN8", "B00004WG2F", "B00AEFXKUI", "B001R3YRG2", "B002NZK5UU", "B00004XPPG", "B0034G4P7G", "B000FKO5QK", "B0009MDPYM", "B000NVT0SO", "B003ASLJQS", "B00005JPD0", "B00005JKWX", "B000YAF4MA", "B00005JKIS", "6305065551", "0783229526", "0783233477", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B002CPMB9O", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00005JA8B", "B00AEFXYJA", "B0000YEEGM", "B007D5E7C2", "B0002V7ON8", "B000N6U0E2", "B00AEFY5B6", "B00AEBB8LA", "6305718954", "B002AT8K9W", "B00AMSLDTM", "B000FS9FCG"], "bought_together": ["B0007DFJ0G", "6305313687"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004LWZW4M", "B00005V9HH", "B0007DFJ0G", "B000P0J0EW"]}, "price": 13.96, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 172718}, "asin": "0790729989", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51VQ890AJML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Seven (Widescreen)"}
{"description": "When Ridley Scott's cut ofBlade Runnerwas finally released in 1993, one had to wonder why the studio hadn't done it right the first time--11 years earlier. This version is so much better, mostly because of what's been eliminated (the ludicrous and redundant voice-over narration and the phony happy ending) rather than what's been added (a bit more character development and a brief unicorn dream). Star Harrison Ford originally recorded the narration under duress at the insistence of Warner Bros. executives who thought the story needed further \"explanation\"; he later confessed that he thought if he did it badly they wouldn't use it. (Moral: Never overestimate the taste of movie executives.) The movie's spectacular futuristic vision of Los Angeles--a perpetually dark and rainy metropolis that's the nightmare antithesis of \"Sunny Southern California\"--is still its most seductive feature, an otherworldly atmosphere in which you can immerse yourself. The movie's shadowy visual style, along with its classic private-detective/murder-mystery plot line (with Ford on the trail of a murderous android, or \"replicant\"), makesBlade Runnerone of the few science fiction pictures to legitimately claim a place in the film noir tradition. And, as in the best noir, the sleuth discovers a whole lot more (about himself and the people he encounters) than he anticipates....

Emmet Walsh.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783225903", "B004L9GMBC", "0783226063", "B00000ILDD", "0800195175", "B0018O4YT0", "B0007PALZ2", "B00004Y87O", "B003ELKNH2", "B00AEFYDM2", "B0002CHIKG", "B00005ATQB", "B00005JL78", "0790729342", "B0045HCJKS", "0767830555", "B0002CHK1S", "B00005N5S5", "B000063JDE", "B000P0J0AQ", "B00005R2IS", "B0013LL2Z2", "B00I9TDMRM", "B0045HCJ9O", "B008MIMWP8", "B0045HCJ0S", "B00005JLWN", "B00005N7Z1", "B000YBKO6U", "B0006GAOJA", "B0007DFJ0G", "B001WLMOL4", "B00003CXXP", "6304698798", "B00000JSJC", "B000286RP2", "B003AWRMCE", "B0040QYROA", "0783228457", "B004SIP9Z6", "B002ZG980U", "079284646X", "B00079Z9VO", "B002VWNIAY", "B00005J75F", "B005LAIHXQ", "B000VECAD0", "B0000VCZK2", "B00005PJ8T", "0345404475", "B001DJLD1M", "0792839056", "B0045HCJ9E", "B0050FXDDQ", "B0045HCJGC", "B004SIP95G", "B007STBUHI", "B00006ADD5", "B00GHJ1YUI", "B003ZXDP0Q", "B000A7DVR2", "0790731932", "B000NA1WGS", "B00AMSLDTM", "B008JFUN50", "B0068FZ0O2", "B000QUCQX8", "B000E6ESEO", "B00AEFXN9G", "B004FQX5B6", "B0002KVUKM", "B0016I0AJG", "B007FQXEWI", "B000N6TX1I", "B002VWNIDG", "B00ENNBZ68", "B00K5EJHGO", "B001VLBDD0", "078401213X", "0780022343", "B0018CMJSU", "B005LAII3A", "B000OVLBHG", "B006TTC5HC", "B0049985XW", "B0000844I8", "B00005JKFR", "B00AEFY3MC", "B000BZISSU", "0783226837", "6305133476", "B000022TSY", "B000FS9FCG", "B00070FX5U", "B008MIMWQW", "B00AEBBADG", "B004GJYRKA", "B002Z7FWBI", "B000BR9S96", "B00000K3TS"], "bought_together": ["B004L9GMBC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005LAIHXQ", "B009JBWOU0", "B00HUCF7AO", "B0018O4YT0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 68358}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 10.21, "brand": "WARNER BROTHERS", "asin": "0790729628", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ST8TQP63L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)"}
{"description": "It's enlightening to view Tim Burton'sMars Attacks!as his twisted satire of the blockbuster filmIndependence Day, which was released earlier the same year, although the movies were in production simultaneously. Burton's eye-popping, schlock tribute to 1950s UFO movies actually plays better on video than it did in theaters. The idea of invading aliens ray gunning the big-name movie stars in the cast is a cleverly subversive one, and the bulb-headed, funny-sounding animated Martians are pretty nifty, but it all seemed to be spread thin on the big screen. On video, however, the movie's kooky humor seems a bit more concentrated. The Earth actors (most of whom get zapped or kidnapped for alien science experiments) include Jack Nicholson, Glenn Close, Annette Bening, Pierce Brosnan, Danny DeVito, Martin Short, Sarah Jessica Parker, Rod Steiger, Michael&nbsp;J.

{"description": "Despite Steven Seagal's imposing presence in this enjoyable thriller, Kurt Russell turns out to be the real star as an American intelligence expert who finds himself leading a strike force against Islamic terrorists who have seized in-flight control of a 747 jetliner with 400 passengers. It's not all that different fromAir Force One, but the formula story perks right along with considerable suspense as Russell's cohorts (Oliver Platt, Joe Morton) try to defuse a chemical bomb that could wipe out (you guessed it) the entire Eastern seaboard. John Leguizamo plays one of the U.S. commandos attempting to stop the violent hijackers, and Halle Berry costars as a flight attendant who risks her life to assist Russell's rescue team.

{"description": "After his successful direction of the Broadway hitsBarefoot in the ParkandThe Odd Couple,Mike Nichols made his filmmaking debut with this outstanding and still-powerful screen adaptation (by Ernest Lehman) of Edward Albee's taboo-shattering play. In their fourth film together (and by far their finest), Richard Burton and Oscar winner Elizabeth Taylor play a New England couple whose marriage hangs by a thin thread of self-deception, vicious verbal jousting, and embittered mutual need. George Segal and Sandy Dennis (who also won an Oscar) play the younger, unsuspecting couple who awkwardly witness the devastating rivalry of their hosts. Handling adult themes with intelligence and forceful dramatic impact, this was the film that finally shattered Hollywood's self-censoring Production Code with commercially successful results. The DVD features an insightful commentary track by Haskell Wexler, whose black-and-white cinematography deservedly won an Academy Award.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000EBD9T4", "B004XKVP7K", "B00004TWZH", "B0045HCJ8U", "B00004TX2E", "B000EBD9TE", "B00000JL7T", "B008BFSMBA", "B00003CXBZ", "0451218590", "B00006RCO1", "B001KXZGO6", "B00007L4MV", "B00008MTW2", "0767827902", "B0045HCJ08", "B00003CXBU", "B00027JYNK", "B0007US7FI", "B0000549B1", "B00BQ7GU1Y", "B0009NZ2MO", "B001LPWGGY", "B00AEBB89C", "B000KHI2FS", "B000EBD9U8", "B0010YSD7W", "B000OE33MO", "B0009S4IKQ", "B008SAPCAM", "B00079Z9VO", "B006FE83UE", "B0087ZG7R0", "B00027JYLM", "B000CNESU8", "B000BZISSU", "B00AEFXN9G", "B00AEFYSWM", "B00AEFYNG8", "0792833287", "B00007KQA2", "B0001HAINQ", "B0010YVCI4", "B0049985XW", "B00007G1WH", "0780020707", "B009NYF2GQ", "B000TXP56C", "B0050FXDDQ", "B004FQX5B6", "B0002B15ZG", "B000I2JDFI", "B00006RCO2", "B0087ZG7OI", "B00005JKF6", "B000XJD34I", "B00AEFY9GW", "B00569I56Q", "B0008ENHTO", "B008ALNQDY", "B000063K2Q", "B00AEFXD1O", "B001GUYAZY", "B004H83IFU", "B00AEBBA9U", "B00007ELDP", "B00871C09S", "B000068TPG", "B002D755A8", "B00005PJ6W", "B00005JKG9", "B00004XPPK", "B000ERVKJY", "6305081034", "6304907729", "B00009NHC5", "B001D8W7EU", "B00J3CTVXI", "B003LMPKSQ", "B004GJYR7I", "B003XMKMVE", "B00AKGG5WG", "B000UJ48VI", "B00AEBB932", "B000EU1Q1I", "B000MGBLHS", "B00K6D1S7A", "B003O7I6SE", "B00005RDRP", "B0008ENIAC", "B000EHQU0S", "B000KGGJ1I", "B0045HCJQW", "B000BYA4HE", "B0007WRT4Q", "B000055Y0X", "B0045HCJS0", "B000059XTI", "B0007US7EY", "B000F7CEC0"], "bought_together": ["B000EBD9T4", "B0045HCJ8U"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00004TWZH", "B0045HCJ8U", "B002M2Z3BA", "B000EBD9T4"]}, "price": 25.0, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 147968}, "asin": "0790732254", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5183CT06SGL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"}
{"description": "One of the key movies of the 1970s, when exciting, groundbreaking, personal films were still being made in Hollywood, Milos Forman'sOne Flew over the Cuckoo's Nestemphasized the humanistic story at the heart of Ken Kesey's more hallucinogenic novel. Jack Nicholson was born to play the part of Randle Patrick McMurphy, the rebellious inmate of a psychiatric hospital who fights back against the authorities' cold attitudes of institutional superiority, as personified by Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher). It's the classic antiestablishment tale of one man asserting his individuality in the face of a repressive, conformist system--and it works on every level. Forman populates his film with memorably eccentric faces, and gets such freshly detailed and spontaneous work from his ensemble that the picture sometimes feels like a documentary. Unlike a lot of films pitched at the &quot;youth culture&quot; of the 1970s,One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nestreally hasn't dated a bit, because the qualities of human nature that Forman captures--playfulness, courage, inspiration, pride, stubbornness--are universal and timeless. The film swept the Academy Awards for 1976, winning in all the major categories (picture, director, actor, actress, screenplay) for the first time since Frank Capra'sIt Happened One Nightin 1931.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002VWNIDG", "B000RTB0R6", "B006TTC5HC", "B000FVQLQQ", "B000P0J0EW", "0767830555", "B0043X1FL8", "B00003CWQR", "B004SIP7ZS", "B003ELKNH2", "B0006GAOJA", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00AEFXN9G", "0767811100", "0792833287", "B004SIP95G", "B0000YEEGM", "B00079Z9VO", "0451163966", "B00AEFYSWM", "B000P0J09M", "B008MIMWP8", "B000EHQU0S", "B006FE83UE", "B000M341QE", "B00AEFXESQ", "B00002VWE0", "B004SIP8ZM", "B002VWNIAY", "B00009W5CA", "0764586629", "B000ZM1MGE", "B00011CZRE", "B000P0J09C", "B0008ENHUI", "B00005V9HH", "B0019L770A", "B0019L21GA", "B00AEBB9CS", "B0050FXDDQ", "B000CNESTE", "B0006GANN2", "B000LP6KNU", "B000P0J0EM", "B00000IQV7", "B000055Y0X", "B00001ZWUS", "079073219X", "B0019UGYK0", "079284646X", "B00AEBB9F0", "B003ASLJO0", "B000A7DVR2", "B00AEBB9FA", "B0002B15ZG", "B004U7MR3M", "B000YAF4MA", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00066FBQG", "B00005JKIS", "6305144168", "B004SIP7TE", "B002ZG980U", "B00005ATQB", "B0045HCJ94", "0783229526", "B000A3XY5A", "B000093FLA", "B00026ZD04", "B004L9GMBC", "B0000DI87S", "B00006RCO1", "B0007PALZ2", "B0000JBALO", "B004IFYMYI", "B007N31YH0", "B000P0J0D8", "B000H4JH7Q", "B00B0U2SFE", "0792846443", "B007D0FVRM", "B000022TSY", "B0087ZG7UW", "B0002234LS", "B0045HCJ9E", "B0000A02TZ", "B001GD6VTE", "B00AEFYRP0", "0784011710", "B00009AOAZ", "B00005JLSB", "B000Q678OO", "0792838408", "6305882592", "B003LMPKSQ", "B00005MEOU", "B00AEFYSL8", "B0057ZAA6W", "B001AEF6BI", "B000HC2LHG"], "bought_together": ["B002VWNIDG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000P0J0EW", "0451163966", "B006TTC5HC", "B00AEFY0F2"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 40218}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.24, "brand": "WARNER STUDIOS", "asin": "0790732181", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51pJoIlXFbL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"}

{"description": "Steven Seagal can consider himself lucky if he ever makes a better movie than this one, which was appropriately dubbed &quot;Die Hardon a battleship&quot; when released in 1992. Seagal handles the heroic duties with his usual wooden efficiency, but the movie's greatest assets are a punchy script and the scene-stealing performances of Tommy Lee Jones and Gary Busey.

{"description": "After Hammer Studios' tremendous success withThe Curse of Frankenstein, they struck a deal to adapt Universal's catalog of classics and set their sights first onDracula. Christopher Lee removes the monstrous makeup from the earlier film and makes his entrance as an elegant, confident, altogether seductive Dracula, a frightening figure of flashing eyes and erotic allure. Peter Cushing, with his hawklike profile and piercing eyes, turns his rationalist intensity to Van Helsing: man of science as crusading vampire hunter. Director Terence Fisher and screenwriter Jimmy Sangster make a few changes to Bram Stoker's tale; gone are Renfield, Transylvania, howling wolves, and transformations into bats. The Count is an old-world aristocrat firmly ensconced in a castle in England and Van Helsing a crusading vampire hunter who plots his demise with an elaborate plan. This is the first film to really mine the erotic appeal of vampires: Dracula seduces Mina and Lucy like a devil tempting good to the dark side through sex--more suggestive than explicit, but daring for 1958. Lee is electric as the ferocious Count, despite his limited screen time, and Cushing turns Van Helsing into a virtual swashbuckler of a hero, leaping and diving through the climax like an aging action hero. Cushing reprises his role inThe Brides of Dracula, while Lee absented himself from the series until 1966'sDracula: Prince of Darkness.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["1564427099", "0790736098", "0790736071", "6302814707", "6302503507", "6305095566", "6303149189", "6300208052", "6300183092", "0792845552", "6300183629", "6300181278"], "also_viewed": ["0790736098", "1564427099", "0790736071", "B00BPX7K5Y"]}, "price": 59.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 607938}, "asin": "0790736101", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/513ZKF03WDL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Horror of Dracula [VHS]"}

{"description": "Running time 127 minutes, Black and White, with original theatrical trailer. Starring Humphrey Bogart and Walter Huston, Tim Holt and Bruce Bennett, directed by John Huston.\n\nGold in the hills, avarice in the hearts of men. Two hard-luck drifters (Bogart and Holt) and a grizzled prospector (Huston) discover gold. Then greed and paranoia set in.\n\nShot mostly on location in Mexico, The Treasure of the Sierra Madre cost a then-whopping $3 million - and led to a showdown. At that price, Jack Warner argued, the top-billed Bogart shouldn't be bumped off before the finale. But director John Huston stood his ground and went on to win high honors: two Academy Awards for his direction and screenplay. And his father won the Oscar as Best Supporting Actor. Without awards, but with enduring acclaim, is Bogart's performance, transforming before our eyes from a likable hobo to a heartless thug who simmers in his own greed. A half-century later, its placement on the American Film Institute's Top 100 American Film list confirms it's still a powerful movie.", "related": {"also_bought": ["0790743159", "6301968948", "6301797906", "0783222955", "B000BWIZRW", "B000BWIZTU", "6304429274", "6303402070", "0800100832", "6301978110", "6304196954", "6304111398", "630150528X", "6302816254", "B00000F13T", "0792839846", "6301977165", "6302227127", "6303109950", "6302158176", "630233683X", "0792837371", "6302353785", "630018627X", "6302032245", "0790734079", "B00005A1VH", "0792837967", "0800125762", "B00000FZCU", "6300215512", "0800132009", "0792837630", "6301801954", "630266232X", "0790743531", "6302226899", "1558807780", "1569942072", "6301800974", "6302909023", "6304259131", "6301805615", "6301798759", "B000PYKZYC", "B000006914", "0790748169", "6303393985", "6300216012", "6300268470", "B000077VT7"], "bought_together": ["0790743159"], "also_viewed": ["6305123616", "0783216084", "6303402070", "6304429274", "6301797906", "1558807780"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 418473}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.0, "brand": "", "asin": "0790743523", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HQXK3ZV4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre [VHS]"}

Neo has always questioned his reality, but the truth is far beyond his imagination. Neo finds himself targeted by the police when he is contacted by Morpheus, a legendary computer hacker branded a terrorist by the government. Morpheus awakens Neo to the real world, a ravaged wasteland where most of humanity have been captured by a race of machines that live off of the humans' body heat and electrochemical energy and who imprison their minds within an artificial reality known as the Matrix. As a rebel against the machines, Neo must return to the Matrix and confront the agents: super-powerful computer programs devoted to snuffing out Neo and the entire human rebellion.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JLTM", "B0001DI5W6", "0784011923", "B001FB55HQ", "0792845684", "B001DZFYPW", "0790731975", "6300271331", "B00003CXE6", "0792839846", "0792133153", "6303257844", "6303313345", "6300182304", "6303168507", "B00000JGEK", "6304071876", "6300215830", "6301963725", "0800199421", "6303398480", "6305363668", "6303202004", "079213690X", "6304258984", "B0000509BZ", "6304434170", "630018627X", "6301976622", "0783222955", "6302610702", "6302787564", "0800132009", "0767825411", "6303020089", "6301574117", "6302909023", "B000003KHS"], "bought_together": ["B00005JLTM", "B0001DI5W6"], "also_viewed": ["B001DJLD1M", "B0054509I4", "B001CEE1YE", "B00005JKCH", "6303148352", "B000AYELVA", "B001GZ6QEC", "B001JNNDBA", "B0000AXE8I", "B0001DI5W6", "6303215734", "B00005JLTM", "B0007WFX62", "6304143184", "B00005N5S5", "B001AQT0Z4", "B001FB55HQ", "B0013FBS20", "B0001BKAEY", "B000PC6A3E", "B00007ELF1", "B00005JMQW", "B0000633U4", "1880521008", "B004XKVPG6", "B00ANGID14", "B001RIY4WE", "B008M4MB8K", "B00AEFY5B6", "B00B4804KS", "B00E5I2MCM", "B005LAIHY0", "B0013FSL3E", "B00471JSRE", "B0057R5XRG", "B00E9PMMX0", "B00C3MKCF6", "B00BEZTMFY", "B00AQNOCZ0", "B00IWULSTC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 579943}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.97, "brand": "", "asin": "0790745399", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51208Z0A3HL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Matrix"}
{"description": "For inexplicable reasons,Foreign Correspondentnever achieved the fame ofThe 39 StepsorNorth by Northwest, but it is certainly good enough to join the ranks of these better-known Hitchcock thrillers. Set just before the beginning of World War II, the film focuses on murder, international intrigue, and an innocent Joel McCrea caught between spies and counterspies. Highlights include an assassination on a rainy day with the killer escaping into a sea of umbrellas, a group of spies who signal their Dutch contacts by turning windmills against the wind, and an extraordinary climax aboard a plane that crashes into the ocean. In McCrea's final speech, you can hear the British filmmaker uniting American patriotism with the anti-Nazi cause.--Raphael Shargel", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301800974", "1558807780", "B00000FZXC", "B00DL48BM6", "B000CCW2UW", "0782008445", "0783217528", "630352138X", "0790743213", "6301798732", "6300246868", "0800100832", "0783235704", "B000067JAU", "B005XB8SLY", "6301564456", "6303905587", "B0002IXSVI", "6300215644", "6301797957", "0783236352", "6300269264", "630150528X", "6301797930", "B0039UU3IM", "6300270386", "B00000JNUZ", "6301975987", "6300273202", "0783235593", "6301968972", "6305226199", "0783235623", "0783221347", "B00979KQ54", "6300183912", "630196697X", "0783235674", "6302801133", "0782008348", "B000WPJT0K", "6300215571", "079074886X", "6302503493"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 449326}, "asin": "079074239X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41W8RS83FBL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Foreign Correspondent [VHS]"}
{"description": "A stupendous historical saga,Braveheartwon five Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Director for star Mel Gibson. He plays William Wallace, a 13th-century Scottish commoner who unites the various clans against a cruel English King, Edward the Longshanks (Patrick McGoohan). The scenes of hand-to-hand combat are brutally violent, but they never glorify the bloodshed. There is such enormous scope to this story that it works on a smaller, more personal scale as well, essaying love and loss, patriotism and passion. Extremely moving, it reveals Gibson as a multitalented performer and remarkable director with an eye for detail and an understanding of human emotion. (His first directorial effort was 1993'sMan Without a Face.) The film is nearly three hours long and includes several plot tangents, yet is never dull.

{"description": "When the theatrical release of James Cameron'sTitanicwas delayed from July to December of 1997, media pundits speculated that Cameron's $200&nbsp;million disaster epic would cause the director's downfall, signal the end of the blockbuster era, and sink Paramount Studios as quickly as the ill-fated luxury liner had sunk on that fateful night of April&nbsp;14, 1912. Some studio executives were confident, others horrified, but the clarity of hindsight turned Cameron into an Oscar-winning genius, a shrewd businessman, and one of the most successful directors in the history of motion pictures.Titanicwould surpass the $1&nbsp;billion mark in global box-office receipts (largely due to multiple viewings, the majority by teenage girls), win 11&nbsp;Academy Awards including best picture and director, produce the best-selling movie soundtrack of all time, and make a global superstar of Leonardo DiCaprio. A bona fide pop-cultural phenomenon, the film has all the ingredients of a blockbuster (romance, passion, luxury, grand scale, a snidely villain, and an epic, life-threatening crisis), but Cameron's alchemy of these ingredients proved more popular than anyone could have predicted. His stroke of genius was to combine absolute authenticity with a pair of fictional lovers whose tragic fate would draw viewers into the heart-wrenching reality of theTitanicdisaster. As starving artist Jack Dawson and soon-to-be-married socialite Rose DeWitt Bukater, DiCaprio and Kate Winslet won the hearts of viewers around the world, and their brief but never-forgotten love affair provides the humanity that Cameron needed to turnTitanicinto an emotional experience. Present-day framing scenes (featuring Gloria Stuart as the 101-year-old Rose) add additional resonance to the story, and although some viewers proved vehemently immune to Cameron's manipulations, few can deny the production's impressive achievements. Although some of the computer-generated visual effects look artificial, others--such as the sunset silhouette ofTitanicduring its first evening at sea, or the climactic splitting of the ship's sinking hull--are state-of-the-art marvels. In terms of sets and costumes alone, the film is never less than astounding. More than anything else, however, the film's overwhelming popularity speaks for itself.Titanicis an event film and a monument to Cameron's risk-taking audacity, blending the tragic irony of theTitanicdisaster with just enough narrative invention to give the historical event its fullest and most timeless dramatic impact.Titanicis an epic love story on par withGone with the Wind, and like that earlier box-office phenomenon, it's a film for the ages.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305123616", "6304117752", "6301792734", "6303215734", "B00000JS61", "6304178352", "6303396623", "6303314015", "B00003CXTF", "0769403468", "6301734734", "6302936381", "6303300480", "6305368139", "B00005RRG3", "6302610702", "0792839846", "6300207919", "B000P0J0C4", "6304546262", "B000056BRF", "6304400551", "6303101267", "630150528X", "6303637574", "B000P0J0EW", "6305126062", "6302935148", "0800199421", "6304681496", "0792116887", "6301963911", "B0000DCGT1", "B00001IVED", "6305169187", "B00006RCST", "6300216721", "630197879X", "0800113055", "076780922X", "080010367X", "0800141326", "0800184319", "6304039522", "B000066AXC"], "bought_together": ["6305123616"], "also_viewed": ["B009VQHDSQ", "6303314015", "B0074JODXU", "B00003CXTF", "B003JQZXWW", "6302787068", "6301796535", "0788812807", "0788806270", "B00005JKDQ", "6304500831", "6305229449", "6304117752", "6300213668", "6304089767", "B0000AQZYM", "079213690X", "6303049079", "6305123616", "6303402348", "6301792734", "0788812408", "B00079HZSE", "B000035Z2S", "B00000K3AN", "0788805843", "6302526574", "B0000029YC", "6303534422", "6303215734", "B0070285YE", "B00008LDO9", "0783216084", "6304434340", "B00BBND56G", "0788805533", "6300183211", "6302320402", "6305750750", "B0002CHI3S", "0790748266", "6304143184", "B0000040CM", "B005X7H9SQ", "B00004RFHF", "B00005V1Z7", "6302814782", "6301572688", "B00000JS61", "B008SLUWZG", "6303257844", "B00078XGO2", "0790736039", "B0000040EJ", "B000065U6Q", "B00003CX7L", "B00000ADKZ", "6300263673", "6302178924"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 65950}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.47, "brand": "Paramount", "asin": "0792151712", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21BAWEVBJ1L.jpg", "title": "Titanic [VHS]"}

The film did respectable business, but it wasn't until its debut on television that this family favorite saw its popularity soar.

Young Dorothy Gale (Judy Garland), her dog, Toto, and her three companions on the Yellow Brick Road to Oz--the Tin Man (Jack Haley), the Cowardly Lion (Bert Lahr), and the Scarecrow (Ray Bolger)--have become pop-culture icons and central figures in the legacy of fantasy for children. As the Wicked Witch who covets Dorothy's enchanted ruby slippers, Margaret Hamilton has had the singular honor of scaring the wits out of children for more than six decades. The film's still as fresh, frightening, and funny as it was when first released. It may take some liberal detours from the original story by L. Frank Baum, but it's loyal to the Baum legacy while charting its own course as a spectacular film. Shot in glorious Technicolor, befitting its dynamic production design (Munchkinland alone is a psychedelic explosion of color and d&eacute;cor),The Wizard of Ozmay not appeal to every taste as the years go by, but it's required viewing for kids of all ages.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B005F96UJ6", "B0000VCZKM", "B00E9ZATKI", "0792839749", "B0087F7VSY", "B0090XLDKY", "B002M2Z3BA", "076781326X", "B00C7JGDBW", "B000P0J09W", "B000URDCC6", "B002HK9IDQ", "B0000DZ3EN", "B000RPCK2E", "B000065V42", "B001JV5BF8", "B0000AM6IY", "B00335EQ0E", "B005NFJAZS", "B003VS0CX8", "B0000VCZKW", "0062278010", "B002NZK5SW", "B0010X744G", "B00CQRN3QI", "B0009XT8ME", "B000HT3PGU", "B006VJ1AAI", "B00005RRG7", "B008H6GHEM", "B00GVFJ5QS", "B00HVBB140", "B002VWNIAY", "B000BT970O", "B002CLBJPK", "0060293233", "B00028HBES", "B00322XV8Q", "B00EV1YZ96", "B000AJJNIG", "B00AATV0WS", "B0054OGQM8", "1495421864", "0739060821", "B00AEFXMGU", "0792833759", "B00AMSQBNK", "B000TPTCP0", "B0009X75QU", "B00ITVMMOY", "B00005RRGB", "B0017Q0SJ4", "0767836324", "B004302N2Q", "084318017X", "B001GLX6UI", "B003YBW2Y4", "1402766254", "B00019GHU2", "B00003CXCQ", "B00AMSM9CW", "B00005JG6M", "B0047QLNUY", "B00GDT5T9Y", "B00447L4JG", "0767819659", "B00000JPH6", "B002BIGCXS", "B00G5G7EXY", "B0000AK7AB", "B006FE83UE", "B002VWNIBI", "B00005JL1P", "B001ILFUDC", "0800177258", "B000QQLVPQ", "B00005RDSQ", "B00JHH1ZN8", "B0006IINYQ", "B0015NORDW", "B002GHHHNS", "B0013ND30M", "0792838408", "B001AGXEAG", "B0047CG9F2", "B00006ADD5", "B0013FSL3E", "B00079Z9VO", "B00F6SHECS", "B0008JIJ2E", "B00CTNYLQA", "B00005JN4W"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00HVBB140", "B005F96UJ6", "B0000VCZKM", "B00I6JOD2S"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 206236}, "asin": "0792833171", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GYW80GAJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Wizard of Oz"}

{"description": "In the year 2018, violence and crime have been totally eliminated from society and given outlet in the brutal blood sport of rollerball, a high-velocity blend of football, hockey, and motor-cross racing sponsored by the multinational corporations that now control the world following the collapse of traditional politics. James Caan plays Jonathan E., the reigning superstar of rollerball, whose corporate controllers fear that Jonathan's popularity has endowed him with too much power. They begin to pressure him according to their own ruthless set of rules, but Jonathan has rules of his own--the rules of a man determined to retain his soul in a world gone mad. As directed by Norman Jewison (who was enjoying a peak of success during the early and mid-1970s),Rollerballcreates a believable society that's been rendered passive and compliant by the homogenization of corporate dictatorships, where the control and flow of information is the only currency of any importance. It's a world in which natural human aggressions have been sublimated and vented through the religious fervor toward rollerball and its players.Rollerballnow looks like one of those 1970s science fiction films (another example beingLogan's Run) that seems a bit dated and quaint, but its ideas are still provocative and fascinating, and the production is visually impressive. The DVD includes full-screen and widescreen versions of the film, audio commentary by director Norman Jewison, a behind-the-scenes featurette, an interactive \"rollergame,\" trivia, and production notes.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0038SUBEG", "B0045HCJKS", "B0013LL2Z2", "B0016I0AJG", "B00003CXTD", "B00004Y87O", "B000P0J0BU", "B000063UR1", "0792838947", "B00008438U", "B0002CHIKG", "B00DX88G16", "B0019BI1DM", "B00000IXPN", "B00AEBB8VK", "6305869103", "0446768391", "B004VT9JMG", "B0050MB5N4", "0792840453", "B001DE29SI", "B001BGS17Q", "B000059HAE", "B0000AOX0F", "B00004TX5G", "B00005V0XF", "B0045HCJSU", "B00AEFY3TA", "B00ESZZOLI", "0783225903", "B003XURDAY", "B00AEFYDM2", "1606730266", "B0038SUBF0", "B00466HNG8", "B000087F6L", "6304936532", "B00AKGG828", "B005FQ2H8W", "B00008974J", "B000MV8ABS", "0790750201", "B000AM6OQ2", "B00JQYV0B4", "B000LC4ZBW", "B00009PY48", "B0045HCJT4", "B000NTMA0G", "B0016LFG56", "B0002Y69V8", "B000FVQLKW", "6305869367", "B000BR9S96", "B00AEFYR3C", "B000063UR5", "B00020X88Y", "B000O78KWE", "0790731932", "B001JAFYFG", "B0040QYROA", "B00005JKFR", "0767802454", "B004KPLVV8", "B0003JAOO0", "B000055Y0X", "B005OT7YF6", "B000XT1P4S", "B000YDOOHI", "B004VT9JLM", "B00I099JO6", "B0002KPHZQ", "B00005N5S5", "B007Y1NNAW", "B004OB2EYQ", "B00005R2IS", "B00000IREA", "B00005ATQB", "B0015NORDW", "B00C3ALLDA", "6305944288", "B00097DY2A", "B000PKG6OE", "B0008191WO", "B000059H85", "6305428158", "B0000DBJ29", "B0000524FE", "B0001I55SS", "B00AEFXR8I", "B000HEWEDK", "B000EHQTZO", "0792839684", "B000KGGIV4", "B00C7A8WZQ", "B000N3SROU", "B0006B2A42", "B00518A70E", "B004GFGUDQ"], "bought_together": ["B0045HCJKS", "B0016I0AJG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00003CXTD", "B0045HCJKS", "B00JAQJMJ0", "0792838947"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 46508}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 25.45, "brand": "CAAN,JAMES", "asin": "0792838300", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51J8WABD9XL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Rollerball"}

{"description": "A stirring example of courage and the indomitable human spirit, for many John Sturges'sThe Great Escapeis both the definitive World War II drama and the nonpareil prison escape movie. Featuring an unequalled ensemble cast in a rivetingly authentic true-life scenario set to Elmer Bernstein's admirable music, this picture is both a template for subsequent action-adventure movies and one of the last glories of Golden Age Hollywood. Reunited with the director who made him a star inThe Magnificent Seven, Steve McQueen gives a career-defining performance as the laconic Hilts, the baseball-loving, motorbike-riding \"Cooler King.\" The rest of the all-male Anglo-American cast--Dickie Attenborough, Donald Pleasance, James Garner, Charles Bronson, David McCallum, James Coburn, and Gordon Jackson--make the most of their meaty roles (though you have to forgive Coburn his Australian accent). Closely based on Paul Brickhill's book, the various escape attempts, scrounging, forging, and ferreting activities are authentically realized thanks also to technical advisor Wally Flood, one of the original tunnel-digging POWs. Sturges orchestrates the climax with total conviction, giving us both high action and very poignant human drama. Without trivializing the grim reality,The Great Escapethrillingly celebrates the heroism of men who never gave up the fight.--Mark Walker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0007TKNM4", "B00004XPPC", "B0008ENHUI", "B00407PNY2", "B000MGTQ7U", "B000059TFW", "B000O78L00", "B000A2WJBQ", "B003PIUII8", "0792839730", "B003ASLJPE", "B000CNESN0", "B0007TKNGA", "B000EHSVS2", "B000EHSVSC", "B00005N5S3", "B00005PJ8S", "B003AWRMCO", "B0009HKH6Q", "B00BLA94IM", "B00AEFYPHA", "B0019UGYK0", "B00AEFY9YY", "B00AEFYBA6", "B00006ADD5", "B0008ENHTY", "B000ASDFHC", "B004R6JG7Q", "0792844017", "B0008ENHTO", "B00001ZWUS", "0790731460", "B00BL9NQ00", "B00AEFXD1O", "B00DDT0JB0", "B001PO556E", "B0049985XW", "B0045HCJ9E", "B00066FBQG", "B007N31YH0", "B000FZETR0", "B0006GANN2", "B00008DDGW", "B00096S4B2", "B0008ENHUS", "B00008PC0Y", "B002VWNIAY", "B003AWRMBA", "B0045HCJTO", "B000062XEX", "B00AEBBA0E", "B004ZRFQCG", "B000MGTQ7K", "B003ASLJRC", "B00CLH0848", "B00005N5S2", "B00441GYYC", "0783226853", "B000O599YO", "B0001AVZBW", "B003AWRMCE", "B004GSVXBW", "B000NTPG6Q", "0393325792", "B00AEFYTEY", "B000FFJYCU", "B0000CBY1C", "B001SV3LL0", "B00005QCVP", "B00079Z9VO", "B00005JN9P", "B00005JKF6", "B003ZEQMH8", "B00008AOTO", "B000O78L0U", "B001DDBD4K", "B000JJSJPK", "0783225733", "B000P0J0EW", "B009YX8MSG", "B0001NBMH6", "B0008ENHV2", "B0006419M8", "B002GHHHP6", "B003INBNOS", "B000CEXEWA", "B000BGR1B4", "B00005LC4D", "B007Y1NR1W", "B0050FXDDQ", "145164261X", "B000O599VC", "B00AEBB9UK", "B000EHSVOG", "B002O3Z4WU", "0767824555", "B004AOECXI", "B00AEBB9NM", "B00008AOTR", "B0013D8M4E"], "bought_together": ["B00004XPPC", "B0007TKNM4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00J4BW0SQ", "B00407PNY2", "B0007TKNM4", "B000059TFW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 1464}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.82, "brand": "Mgm/Ua Studios", "asin": "0792838408", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510N2J46JDL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Great Escape"}
{"description": "Neil Simon's Broadway hit about an effort to reunite a pair of aged vaudevillians for a TV special is both funny and poignant, thanks to the inspired casting of Walter Matthau (perhaps the consummate Simon actor) and George Burns (who kicked off something of a career comeback with this Oscar-winning role). They play a former comedy team who split up years ago over disagreements about how the act should be performed and, more importantly, over their conflicting views about the importance of show business versus that of life. Matthau is hilarious, sometimes touchingly so, while Burns remains a master of comic economy. Richard Benjamin is also good as Matthau's nephew who brings them back together. This was remade for television with Peter Falk and Woody Allen.--Marshall Fine", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0007QJ1ZW"], "also_viewed": ["B0002IQJ9Q"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 355048}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.75, "brand": "", "asin": "079284095X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510VNE0WWJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Sunshine Boys [VHS]"}

{"description": "Freddy Benson (Steve Martin) is a crass, loud American.  Laurence Jameson (Michael Caine) is a suave, urbane European. Their common ground is that they both are confidence men, and they meet in a train compartment as Benson is scamming his way across Europe, taking advantage of women's generosity. The two are forced into a rivalry, which culminates in a wager to see who can be the first to bilk $50,000 out of American heiress Janet Colgate (Glenne Headly). Their game of one-upmanship is, of course, brought to ridiculous heights as things progress. Written by Paul Henning (the mind behind such TV shows asGreen AcresandThe Beverly Hillbillies),Dirty Rotten Scoundrelsis an uneven but funny mix of Martin's physical comedy and Caine's oily charms. Martin's first role as cohort is to assume the persona of Ruprecht, the \"special\" younger brother intended to scare off potential brides. As Ruprecht, he comes off as a cross betweenThe Andy Griffith Show's Ernest T. Bass and Jerry Lewis; hilarious as it is, it doesn't quite fit with the rest of the film. Once the wager is on, though, Martin slips into his overly earnest mode as an American military man suffering from hysterical paralysis, with Caine as a psychologist who takes on his case. All in all,Dirty Rotten Scoundrels(a loose remake of the 1964 filmBedtime Storywith David Niven and Marlon Brando) is a droll, intelligent comedy, short on knee slappers but long on comic situations and characterizations.--Jerry Renshaw", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 434002}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.66, "brand": "", "asin": "0792842391", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/513ZVBB0X6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Dirty Rotten Scoundrels [VHS]"}
{"description": "FutureNightmarecreator andScreamweaver Wes Craven's  film debut is a primitive little production that rises above its cut-rate  production values and hazy, grainy patina via its grimly affecting portrait  of human evil infiltrating a middle-class household. The story is adapted  from Ingmar Bergman'sThe Virgin Spring, but the film has more in  common with Sam Peckinpah'sStraw Dogsas it charts the descent of a  harmless married couple into methodical killers. A quartet of criminals--a  distorted version of the nuclear family--kidnaps a pair of teenage girls and  proceeds to ravage, rape, torture, and finally brutally murder them in the  woods, unwittingly within walking distance of their rural home. The killers  take refuge in the girls' own home, but when the parents discover just who  they are and what they've done, they plot violent retribution.Along with George Romero'sNight of the Living Deadand Tobe Hooper'sTexas Chainsaw Massacre, Craven helped redefine American horror with  this debut--all three movies portray modern society crumbling into madness  and horror. But, unlike his fellow directors, Craven gives his film an  uncomfortable verisimilitude, setting it squarely in the heartland of modern  America. While at times it's awkward and inconsistent, with distracting comic  interludes, his handling of the brutal horror scenes is unsettling, and the  death of the daughter is an unexpectedly quiet and lyrical moment.--Sean  Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792839242", "6302921058", "B00000K0DU", "6300214311", "6300182770", "B00000IQUT"], "also_viewed": ["6302921058"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 475308}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.78, "brand": "", "asin": "079284632X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/512ZWA7XGZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Last House on the Left [VHS]"}

This is the sort of film that looks back on a life and says the battle was its own reward, not the glory. Astin is very moving as a boy who becomes a man and watches his world change, often in unexpected ways, through painful determination.

Gary Oldman plays the vampire, Dracula, doomed to be a creature of the night after forsaking God but aroused by the image of a British woman (Winona Ryder) who resembles his own lost love. Oldman does well by the monster, even if he doesn't register much personality in the process, and Anthony Hopkins is a little overachieving as the vampire killer Van Helsing. The rest of the cast is serviceable, except Keanu Reeves, who--not atypically--is wooden and somehow empty.

{"description": "Just what the world needs, another riff on that post-Psychohorror clich&eacute;: the slasher movie. In this version, which considerably dumbs down the Lois Duncan book, the bad guy chases naughty teenagers with a hook, all the while dressed as a dark version of the Gorton's fisherman. They seem to have killed someone in a car accident while out partying, and a price must be paid. Nothing new is added to the genre, though it would be unfair not to note that this does have some scary moments. That is about all it has, because as much as this wanted to be anotherScream, it hasn't the heart or the script. It does, however, have the requisite cast of small-screen stars (includingParty of Five's Jennifer Love Hewitt and Buffy herself, Sarah Michelle Gellar) to have snagged box-office success, spawning a sequel.--Rochelle O'Gorman", "related": {"also_bought": ["0767826728", "0792151712"], "bought_together": ["0767826728"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 332658}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.8, "brand": "", "asin": "0800184319", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/7107W97AXAL._SY300_.gif", "title": "I Know What You Did Last Summer [VHS]"}

{"description": "Thirteen-year-old Jenna (Shana Dowdeswell) has had enough with the trials of adolescence. In addition to being saddled with a devoted-but-nerdy best friend, Matt (Sean Marquette), she falls victim to one of the dangers of playing Seven Minutes in Heaven with the coolest kids in school: being stranded without a willing make-out partner. Humiliated, Jenna buries herself in the aforementioned make-out closet, wishing she could skip the whole adolescence bit and move straight into adulthood, and miraculously wakes up just weeks away from her 30th birthday. Of course, a lot has changed since going to bed the night before, not the least of which being an impressive set of womanly curves. The new, older Jenna (Jennifer Garner) is a successful magazine editor with friends in high places and a lion's share of potential suitors -- including a hockey-playing boyfriend and a swarthy married man. The problem is that her mind hasn't matured with her body; Jenna not only finds living on her own more terrifying than cool, but is quick to dismiss any male over the age of 14 as \"gross.\" Half excited, half mortified, Jenna seeks out Matt (Mark Ruffalo), whom she learns she had spurned as a teenager in an effort to join the popular crowd.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00006ZXSL", "B00AKGG6JS", "B00005O5CM", "B00AEFXO8Q", "B0015I2RT8", "B001OQCUYI", "B00005JMCW", "B001OQCUZM", "B00003CXSM", "B000J103OI", "B00AEFYM2S", "B002K0WBXW", "B00AEBB8R4", "B000EMGICS", "B004SIP9X8", "B003LSFM6U", "B0000897EG", "B000ELJAEM", "B00AEFY99O", "1401324142", "6304765266", "1416205152", "B00GO37I8Y", "0809229374", "B0001XAR1I", "B0001Z3TXE", "B00005JM55", "B00AEFYWQY", "B00007E2F5", "B0002VYOVI", "B00KS9V6EC", "B000J4QW7W", "B000YDBPAM", "B0007PLLBU", "B001TUZD8O", "B002ZG988M", "B0009OL7Z4", "B004SIP9RO", "B0000ZMGWK", "1400050138", "B0000DZ6N3", "B00AQS803A", "6302077818", "B00006ZXSK", "B00005JN0Z", "B000YAA68C", "B0007LXPBI", "B00E4Z7FQY", "B002P413IC", "B001ASQ9OM", "B006YTGL86", "B00795C5X4", "B00063KGPU", "B000BVM1S2", "B000209KMW", "B000A343RI", "B00062IVN0", "B000P0J0DS", "B00002SSKI", "6305428425", "B003TY2SWC", "B0051GLDVS", "B00008K7AM", "B0071HPOGK", "B0000AKCJK", "B000023VTP", "B00AEBB8YW", "B00006FMUW", "B002XTXG8O", "B00AMEZDJW", "B001AEF6BS", "B00447L4KA", "B000MQC9H4", "6305428042", "B002GOAH1U", "B0036TGSIK", "B002A5EBMQ", "B0000AOV4I", "B001C5LLQ4", "B000324Y98", "B00005JG6N", "6305236569", "B00AEFZ6V4", "B004EPZ070", "B003L20ICE", "B0038N9X3Q", "B00AEBBA2M", "B00005JN3W", "B0075RREYG", "B000F2BNW2", "0783235070", "B0021L8UO4", "0800177258", "B002SYAGNC", "B000HT386M", "B0007P0Y7C", "B000QUU4LY", "B00006ZXSN", "B00AEBB9WI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0013D8LFY", "B002K0WBXW", "B00AKGG6JS", "B001OQCUZM"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 461629}, "asin": "1404918051", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41EO6%2BQ3jvL.jpg", "title": "13 Going on 30: Fun &amp; Flirty Edition"}

{"description": "An experimental film masquerading as a standard Hollywood thriller. The plot ofRopeis simple and based on a successful stage play: two young men (John Dall and Farley Granger) commit murder, more or less as an intellectual exercise. They hide the body in their large apartment, then throw a dinner party. Will the body be discovered? Director Alfred Hitchcock, fascinated by the possibilities of the long-take style, decided to shoot this story as though it were happening in one long, uninterrupted shot. Since the camera can only hold one 10-minute reel at a time, Hitchcock had to be creative when it came time to change reels, disguising the switches as the camera passed behind someone's back or moved behind a lamp. In later years Hitchcock wrote off the approach as misguided, andRopemay not be one of Hitchcock's top movies, but it's still a nail-biter. They don't call him the Master of Suspense for nothing.

Murphy plays a convict on a two-day furlough from prison to help capture his former partner (James Remar).

In their own time, the Starfleet heroes encounter an alien probe emitting a mysterious message--a message delivered in the song of the now-extinct Earth species of humpback whales. Failure to respond to the probe will result in Earth's destruction, so Kirk and company time-travel to 20th-century Earth--in their captured Klingon starship--to transport a humpback whale to the future in an effort to peacefully communicate with the alien probe. The plot sounds somewhat absurd in description, but as executed by returning director Leonard Nimoy, this turned out to be a crowd-pleasing adventure, filled with humor and lively interaction among the favorite Star Trek characters. Catherine Hicks (from TV's7th Heaven) plays the 20th-century whale expert who is finally convinced of Kirk's and Spock's benevolent intentions. With ample comedy taken from the clash of future heroes with 20th-century urban realities,Star Trek IVwas a box-office smash, satisfying mainstream audiences and hardcoreTrekfans alike.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303202004", "6300213803", "6301543408", "6300216802", "6300214400", "6304415346", "B00008OSD3", "6303909949", "6305587159"], "bought_together": ["6303202004", "6300213803"], "also_viewed": ["6300214400", "6300213803", "6301543408", "6303202004", "6300216802", "6304415346", "0800103106", "B00004U8P4", "6300214540", "630273486X", "630339406X", "6302877881", "B00BAXTYIA", "B00000ILBK", "6304539274", "B00DB97LCM", "B001TH16DI"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 116860}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 0.98, "brand": "", "asin": "630021463X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51G68FMQNQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Star Trek IV - The Voyage Home [VHS]"}

Coppola weaves in and out of the story of Vito's transformation into a powerful crime figure, contrasting that evolution against efforts by son Michael Corleone to spread the family's business into pre-Castro Cuba. As memorable as the first film is,The Godfather IIis an amazingly intricate, symmetrical tragedy that touches upon several chapters of 20th-century history and makes a strong case that our destinies are written long before we're born. This was De Niro's first introduction to a lot of filmgoers, and he makes an enormous impression.

{"description": "Back when the  firstStar Trekfeature was released in December 1979, theTrekfranchise was still relatively modest, consisting of the original TV series, an animated cartoon series from 1973-74, and a burgeoning fan network around the world. Series creator Gene Roddenberry had conceived a second TV series, but after the success ofStar Warsthe project was upgraded into this lavish feature film, which reunited the original series cast aboard a beautifully redesigned starship U.S.S.Enterprise. Under the direction of Robert Wise (best known forWest Side Story), the film proved to be a mixed blessing forTrekfans, who heatedly debated its merits; but it was, of course, a phenomenal hit. Capt. Kirk (William Shatner) leads his crew into the vast structures surrounding V'Ger, an all-powerful being that is cutting a destructive course through Starfleet space. With his new First Officer (Stephen Collins), the bald and beautiful Lieutenant Ilia (played by the late Persis Khambatta) and his returning veteran crew, Kirk must decipher the secret of V'Ger's true purpose and restore the safety of the galaxy. The story is rather overblown and derivative of plots from the original series, and avid Trekkies greeted the film's bland costumes with derisive laughter. But as a feast for the eyes, this is an adventure worthy of big-screen trekkin'. Douglas Trumbull's visual effects are astonishing, and Jerry Goldmith's score is regarded as one of the prolific composer's very best (with its main theme later used forStar Trek: The Next Generation).

That same, sustained tone of danger and expectation that made Pollack'sThe Firmso much fun can be found in this 1975 thriller, albeit with an appropriate dose of post-Watergate paranoia.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300216713", "6304140851", "B001PYD0PC", "6304457324", "B00004R67T", "6300182215", "6303451535", "B0000040EJ", "6300182479", "6301798708", "630197803X", "0790733935", "6304458975", "6302226899", "6301965701", "6303482201"], "bought_together": ["6304457324"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 326264}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.88, "brand": "", "asin": "6300216748", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51KHTAQSYKL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Three Days of the Condor [VHS]"}

{"description": "Winner of the 1951 Academy Award for Best Special Effects, this science fiction extravaganza set a new standard for the realistic depiction of cinematic disasters. Of course, it's a quaint curiosity by today's technological standards, but as produced by visual effects pioneer George Pal, this story of Earth's collision with a runaway star is still a dazzling example of screen sci-fi from the '50s, when special effects were entering a new stage of advancement. Despite scientists' warnings about the star's destructive potential, government officials refuse to take action that could cause international panic, but a consortium of private industrialists prepare for the worst by building a gigantic spaceship--an ark for humanity to begin life anew on a distant planet. Who will be chosen to go, and who left behind? As earthquakes roar and massive tidal waves devastate entire cities, the huge rocket prepares for take-off from its miles-long launching ramp--ready to abandon the shattered Earth! Although it's more enjoyable now as a cinematic museum piece,When Worlds Collideremains a milestone of its kind, leading the way for many more screen disasters that followed this movie's still-worthy example.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300185443"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 290628}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.28, "brand": "", "asin": "6300215520", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51D8MYZK8CL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "When Worlds Collide [VHS]"}
{"description": "In the tradition of such obsessively driven directors as Erich von Stroheim and Werner Herzog, Francis Ford Coppola approached the production ofApocalypse Nowas if it were his own epic mission into the heart of darkness. On location in the storm-ravaged Philippines, he quite literally went mad as the project threatened to devour him in a vortex of creative despair, but from this insanity came one of the greatest films ever made. It began as a John Milius screenplay, transposing Joseph Conrad's classic story \"Heart of Darkness\" into the horrors of the Vietnam War, following a battle-weary Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) on a secret upriver mission to find and execute the renegade Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), who has reverted to a state of murderous and mystical insanity. The journey is fraught with danger involving wartime action on epic and intimate scales. One measure of the film's awesome visceral impact is the number of sequences, images, and lines of dialogue that have literally burned themselves into our cinematic consciousness, from the Wagnerian strike of helicopter gunships on a Vietnamese village to the brutal murder of stowaways on a peasant sampan and the unflinching fearlessness of the surfing warrior Lieutenant Colonel Kilgore (Robert Duvall), who speaks lovingly of \"the smell of napalm in the morning.\" Like Herzog'sAguirre: The Wrath of God, this film is the product of genius cast into a pit of hell and emerging, phoenix-like, in triumph. Coppola's obsession (effectively detailed in the riveting documentaryHearts of Darkness, directed by Coppola's wife, Eleanor) informs every scene and every frame, and the result is a film for the ages.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301115430", "630018627X", "0790701251", "6300183211", "6303686796", "6305363668", "079284646X", "6304935811", "0784011923", "6303953425", "0792836510", "6302822688", "B000003KHS", "630021639X", "6304119046", "B00003CXE6", "6302610702", "0792158261", "B000K7VHQE", "6303036570", "6303020089", "6303651488", "0800125762", "B004LWZW9W", "B00000JGEI", "0790705141", "6302360978", "6302415853", "0783107986", "B00005ATQA", "630336568X", "0790731975", "6305095566", "6300216500", "6301662954", "6302921058", "6300246965", "6300182878", "0800100832", "B00005JKEC", "6304286961", "B000062XM6", "0784011575", "630197154X", "B00004TYS8", "B00004WIDB", "6304414099", "0800116917", "6302517036", "0800199421", "6304259131", "0783202253", "6303109950", "6303313345", "B00006C7G9", "0792837312", "6302482712", "6300213986", "6303421563", "6304039549", "B000065U6Q", "B0000A36J1", "6300182770", "B00004CNR5", "6304025831", "6303422020", "0790748169", "0800132009"], "bought_together": ["6301115430", "0790701251"], "also_viewed": ["6303953425", "6305363668", "6305750750", "B00000J2KZ", "6303506291", "6303314015"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 172447}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.75, "brand": "", "asin": "6300214826", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41EFVS37MRL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Apocalypse Now [VHS]"}
{"description": "Written for the stage and coherently opened up for the screen by veteran director Herbert Ross,Play It Again, Samis closer to a conventional comedy than Woody Allen's more self-contained films, but his smart script and archetypal hero-nebbish achieve a special charm aimed squarely at movie buffs. Allen is Allan Felix, a film critic on the rebound after his wife's desertion trying to brave the choppy waters of born-again bachelorhood and struggling to reconcile his celluloid obsessions with the hazards of real-world dating. His apartment is a shrine to Humphrey Bogart, and it's none other than Bogey himself who materializes at strategic moments to counsel Allan on romantic strategy. He gets more corporeal aid from his married friends, Linda (Diane Keaton) and Dick (Tony Roberts), who try to orchestrate prospective matches and reassure him when those chemistry experiments explode. When Allan finds himself falling in love with Linda, the dissonance between fantasy and reality proves both funny and poignant--a precursor to the deeper emotionalism missing from the star's earlier directorial efforts that was soon to inform Allen's most affecting '70s comedies. It's also the start of his onscreen relationship with Keaton, further underscoring Allen's evolution toward a more satisfying contemplation of the friction between head and heart.--Sam Sutherland", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000BWMEIS", "6301972147", "6301963911", "B0000068DV", "6304196806", "6303011411", "6301971922", "B000NNOYH4", "6300183513", "6303686761", "6300150151", "B00005AUJL", "6301967658", "6302779480"], "bought_together": ["B000BWMEIS"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 341486}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 15.41, "brand": "", "asin": "6300216365", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51B8XDZQC1L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Play It Again, Sam [VHS]"}

{"description": "This well-regarded cult film is a tense Kafka-esque tale concerning what happens to a likable computer guy who is in the wrong place at the wrong time in the city that never sleeps--New York. This is a New York infested with bizarre characters vividly brought to life by a once-in-a-lifetime cast. Griffin Dunne's wonderfully controlled comic performance as Paul Hackett is the glue that holds this increasingly surreal film together.  Scorsese utilizes a full array of independent and underground film techniques, including special film speed manipulations, angles, and edits, deftly capturing the strange rhythms of an after-hours New York City. Many will find the jokes clever, and occasionally laugh-out-loud funny. Some, however, will find the film an excruciating series of staged circumstances setting up a sadistically cruel dark nightmare of horrors. And there are a few lines of dialogue so poorly written they remind you how unbelievable the thin story really is. But forgive the film these few lapses--overall it's a wild, surreal ride. The most offbeat character is the beehive-sporting, Monkee-obsessed neurotic played to perfection by Teri Garr.

{"description": "The 1970s were difficult years for the great Japanese director Akira Kurosawa. Following the box-office failure of his 1970 filmDodes'ka-denand an unsuccessful suicide attempt, Kurosawa was unable to find financial backing in Japan, and he made his acclaimed 1975 filmDersu Uzalain Siberia with Russian financing. With only partial Japanese backing for his epic projectKagemusha, the 70-year-old master then found American support from George Lucas and Francis Ford Coppola, who served as coexecutive producers (through 20th Century Fox) for this magnificent 1980 production--to that date the most expensive film in Japanese history. Set in the late 16th century, Kagemusha centers on the Takeda clan, one of three warlord clans battling for control of Japan at the end of the feudal period. When Lord Shingen (Tatsuya Nakadai), head of the Takeda clan, is mortally wounded in battle and near death, he orders that his death be kept secret and that his \"kagemusha\"--or \"shadow warrior\"--take his place for a period of three years to prevent clan disruption and enemy takeover. The identical double is a petty thief (also played by Nakadai) spared from execution due to his uncanny resemblance to Lord Shingen--but his true identity cannot prevent the tides of fate from rising over the Takeda clan in a climactic scene of battlefield devastation. Through stunning visuals and meticulous attention to every physical and stylistic detail, Kurosawa made a film that restored his status as Japan's greatest filmmaker, and the success ofKagemushaenabled the director to make his 1985 masterpiece,Ran.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["1572522089", "6303386717", "6303073107", "6302969697", "6303202055"], "bought_together": ["1572522089"], "also_viewed": ["B002ZG4Q5W", "B003KGBISY", "6302919649", "6303202055", "6303202020"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 331553}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.97, "brand": "", "asin": "6301661737", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51TR8RKDFWL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Kagemusha [VHS]"}
{"description": "This 1963 extravaganza, directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz, is certainly an epic historical drama with all the elements: elaborate sets, intricate costuming, name actors, a factual basis, and an overlong script (just over four hours). But the acting is well performed and the backdrops are lush, making this a film worth seeing. Elizabeth Taylor is Cleopatra, the Egyptian queen who seduces Julius Caesar (Rex Harrison) in a political move to hold onto her empire. When Caesar is killed in the Roman Senate, Cleopatra looks to Marc Antony (Richard Burton) for his support, practically enslaving him with her wiles. Taylor is dramatic in her role, at times overly serious, but stunning nonetheless as the woman described as \"well versed in the natural sciences and mathematics. She speaks seven languages proficiently. Were she not a woman one would consider her to be an intellectual.\" While the film does seem to drag at moments, it deserves the four Oscars it won for cinematography, art direction-set direction, costumes, and special effects.

In revealing much of what Kubrick deliberately left unexplained,2010lacks the enigmatic awe of its predecessor, but it's still a riveting tale of space exploration and extraterrestrial contact, beginning when a joint American-Soviet mission embarks to determine the cause of failure of the derelict spaceshipDiscovery.  Having arrived atDiscoverynear the planet Jupiter, the American mission leader (Roy Scheider) and his Russian counterpart (Helen Mirren) must investigate the apparent failure of the ship's infamous onboard computer, HAL 9000, as well as the meaning of countless mysterious black monoliths amassing on Jupiter's surface (an interpretation Kubrick originally left up to his viewers).

{"description": "Lust for Lifeis appropriately titled, for merepassionseems inadequate when describing this superb fictionalized biography (based on Irving Stone's popular novel) of Vincent Van Gogh. In a deservedly Oscar&reg;- nominated performance, Kirk Douglas is physically and emotionally perfect as the tormented Dutch painter, whose life is chronicled from his ill-fated stint as a preacher to Belgian miners in 1878, to his Impressionist-inspired artistic awakening and psychological descent to suicide in 1890. Having triumphed with 1952'sThe Bad and the Beautiful, Douglas, producer John Houseman, and director Vincente Minnelli brought vigor and vitality to this blessed project, which centers on Van Gogh's stormy friendship with fellow artist Gaugin (Oscar-winner Anthony Quinn). Minnelli used an outmoded color film process and innovative camera techniques to vividly recreate Van Gogh's paintings, and he filmed on the actual Dutch and French locations where Van Gogh's mastery flourished. The artist's lust for life also fed his madness, and this film deeply understands the fine line in between.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0452262496", "6301628667", "6301628616", "B000056BRF", "6303037380", "630266232X"], "bought_together": ["0452262496"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 216652}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6301971191", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51YCP9MZK5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Lust for Life [VHS]"}

{"description": "Sidney Lumet's directorial debut remains a tense, atmospheric (though slightly manipulative and stagy) courtroom thriller, in which the viewer never sees a trial and the only action is verbal. As he does in his later corruption commentaries such asSerpicoorQ & A, Lumet focuses on the lonely one-man battles of a protagonist whose ethics alienate him from the rest of jaded society. As the film opens, the seemingly open-and-shut trial of a young Puerto Rican accused of murdering his father with a knife has just concluded and the 12-man jury retires to their microscopic, sweltering quarters to decide the verdict. When the votes are counted, 11 men rule guilty, while one--played by Henry Fonda, again typecast as another liberal, truth-seeking hero--doubts the obvious. Stressing the idea of \"reasonable doubt,\" Fonda slowly chips away at the jury, who represent a microcosm of white, male society--exposing the prejudices and preconceptions that directly influence the other jurors' snap judgments. The tight script by Reginald Rose (based on his own teleplay) presents each juror vividly using detailed soliloquies, all which are expertly performed by the film's flawless cast. Still, it's Lumet's claustrophobic direction--all sweaty close-ups and cramped compositions within a one-room setting--that really transforms this contrived story into an explosive and compelling nail-biter.--Dave McCoy", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783222955", "6300181987", "6304071876", "6300183513", "6304039530", "6304119046", "0790731975", "6300987485", "6304429274", "1558807780", "6301977149", "6303282237", "6302413435", "B00000K3C7", "6302226899", "B000BWIZRW", "B000006GCU", "6304111231", "0790743531", "6304111363", "6302935148", "6304383169", "6300181529", "6301797957", "630347327X", "0800125762", "B00008FECE", "6303402348", "6303506291", "630522269X", "6305613516", "0783221347", "6304151306", "6301973305"], "also_viewed": ["B00004YRHZ", "B002VRNJTE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 259403}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.87, "brand": "", "asin": "6301976061", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5188HQ5P25L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "12 Angry Men [VHS]"}

{"description": "A vicious alligator named Ramon, who was flushed into the city sewer as a baby, survives to become a 32-foot-long menace who devours animals and people alike. Screenplay by JOHN SAYLES. \"directed this sly horror-comedy from a script by John Sayles, which plays off the old urban legend about the dangers of flushing one's pet alligator down the toilet. One such unlucky reptile is \"Ramon,\" who survives in the subterranean cesspool by feeding on the steroid-saturated carcasses of dogs dumped there by chemical company researchers and eventually bulks up to the size of a Winnebago. When assorted sewage workers start disappearing into Ramon's massive maw, hard-boiled cop David Madison (Robert Forster), who has a history of unlucky partners, reveals a strong personal interest in the case. Deemed a jinx and a nutcase by his superiors, he's kicked off the force and must go underground (literally) to destroy the beast with the help of young reptile-expert Marion (Robin Riker). The witty screenplay is filled with clever references, eccentric characters and in-jokes aplenty (a style reflective of Joe Dante's Piranha and The Howling, both of which Sayles also scripted), which combines with decent effects and a good amount of suspense (particularly in the sewer scenes) to make this an entertaining romp overall. Highlights include Henry Silva's over-the-top performance as a misplaced big-game hunter who recruits urban \"native guides\" in his back-alley search for the elusive Ramon.\" ~ Cavett Binion, All Movie Guide.", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 425092}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "title": "Alligator [VHS] (1980)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B003TX8Q6K"]}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21VPKQCFK2L.jpg", "asin": "6302036720"}

{"description": "Xavier Koller's 1990 drama concerns a Turkish family optimistically leaving a threadbare existence in its native country and setting off on a harrowing journey for better luck in Switzerland. The film is relentless in every sense, in its blow-by-blow portrayal of the characters selling their possessions, traveling an illegal route used by other emigrants, falling in with a cluster of smugglers who do not have their best interests at heart, crossing the Alps on foot (an extended sequence that quickly earned the film its must-see reputation). After all that, they still have to confront Swiss authorities. Brutal and tough going, the heart of the film is not so much the accumulating despair and misery but the strengthening relationships of the central characters.

{"description": "A darkly comic ride, this intense and original 1991 offering from the Coen brothers (Fargo,Blood Simple) gleefully attacks the Hollywood system and those who seek to sell out to it, portraying the writer's suffering as a loony vision of hell. John Turturro (Miller's Crossing,Jungle Fever) plays the title character, a pretentious left-wing writer from New York City who is brought to 1930s Hollywood to write a script for a wrestling movie for palooka actor Wallace Beery. Fink thinks the job is beneath him, but his desire for acceptance gets the better of him, and he suddenly finds himself holed up in a fleabag hotel in Los Angeles, where he is almost immediately afflicted with writer's block. Various distractions begin to enter his life, first in the form of a famous southern writer (John Mahoney) whom Fink idolizes, and then his neighbor in the hotel, a seemingly amiable salesman played by John Goodman (Sea of Love,Raising Arizona). The writer turns out to be a self-loathing drunk whose secretary (Judy Davis) is the one actually doing the writing. And the neighbor, the working-class hero who Fink made his reputation writing about, may have a horrifying secret of his own. Equal parts social commentary and hilarious farce, and winner of the Best Picture, Actor, and Director prizes at the Cannes Film Festival,Barton Finkis a visionary and original comic masterpiece not to be missed.--Robert Lane", "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 454410}, "asin": "6302291879", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516G9RFW8PL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Barton Fink [VHS]"}

Evans is enticed by the family's pacifist ways, but his outlaw past soon catches up with him.

Set in modern Los Angeles--with all its random violence, venality, ubiquitous police presence, earthquakes, and dreams--the film concerns an unusual intersection of lives and chance occurrences that alter everyone's perspective on destiny. Kasdan, very understandably, is attempting to create an experience for viewers as intuitive as the undefined forces propelling his characters.

{"description": "This documentary of the Rolling Stones' 1969 US tour has become a legendary, harrowing symbol of the tragic demise of the \"Peace and Love\" era. After a successful tour across the United States, the Rolling Stones gave a free December concert at Altamont Speedway in California with the Grateful Dead (not seen performing), Ike and Tina Turner, Jefferson Airplane, and the Flying Burrito Brothers (all seen performing one song each). The poorly planned show was fraught with problems from its inception. The band unwisely selected the Hells Angels motorcycle club to provide security, and after the pre-existing chaos was fueled by very visible alcohol and drug abuse, the bikers resorted to violence to keep the stoned, restless, and often naked crowd in line. The result: dozens of injuries and the on-screen stabbing of a young African-American man (during \"Sympathy for the Devil,\" no less) by one of the concert's \"staff security.\" In a manipulative but effective move, the Maysles brothers and Charlotte Zwerin filmed Mick Jagger in the editing room witnessing the on-camera murder for the first time. But aside from that unexpected drama, the film also works as a rock-and-roll document, capturing the band at their most relaxed, intoxicating, and electrifying.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001NXDSLQ", "6301095294"]}, "price": 27.98, "categories": [["CDs & Vinyl", "Classic Rock", "Album-Oriented Rock (AOR)"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Metal"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Rock", "Blues Rock"], ["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 311795}, "asin": "6302415993", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21S9HY0GRFL.jpg", "title": "The Rolling Stones - Gimme Shelter [VHS]"}

Full-screen presentation ofThe ShiningandFull Metal Jacketwas also approved by Kubrick, who recomposed his original framing,  reportedly believing that those films looked best on video in the full-screen format. (In fact, the original theatrical aspect ratio ofThe Shiningwas 1.66:1, meaning that a relatively small portion of the image is lost.) Kubrick also chose mono over stereo,  believing that inconsistencies in theatrical sound systems resulted in loss of control over theatrical presentation.

Susan Strasberg stars as the estranged daughter of a continental millionaire who arrives at his Cote d'Azur estate only to find her father mysteriously gone \"on a business trip.\" When his corpse keeps popping up in the strangest places, only to disappear when her stepmother arrives, she concludes she's the target of a campaign to drive her mad. Ronald Lewis costars as the darkly handsome chauffeur and Christopher Lee makes a memorable appearance as a suspicious doctor. Director Seth Holt deftly handles the twisting curves of Jimmy Sangster's fairly ingenious screenplay, and though at times it telegraphs its secrets, there are plenty of dramatic jolts in the beautifully realized set pieces, notably a spooky underwater swim in a weed-filled swimming pool and a startling bang smack in the middle of the film. It falters in spots (the sudden outpouring of exposition at the conclusion spoils the mood, although it's quickly redeemed by a shocking climax), but the handsome production, elegantly photographed in shadowy black and white by Douglas Slocombe, remains a gripping thriller.--Sean Axmaker", "price": 20.95, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 683205}, "asin": "630280115X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51PP7WQ2PDL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Scream of Fear [VHS]"}

{"description": "\"This story is true,\" reads the opening statement ofA Man  Escaped. \"I give it as it is, without embellishment.\" Based on the memoir by  Andre Devigny, a member of the French Resistance imprisoned and sentenced to death by the Gestapo during the German occupation, Bresson (himself at one time a German POW) transforms Devigny's daring escape into an ascetic film of documentary detail. Kept in a tiny stone cell with a high window and a thick wooden door, the prisoner (renamed Fontaine in the film) makes himself intimate with his world--every surface of his room, every sound reverberating through the hall, and every detail of the prison's layout that he can absorb in brief sojourns from his cell. Bresson magnifies every detail with insistent close-ups and detailed examinations of every step of Fontaine's plan, from constructing and hiding ropes and hooks to painstakingly carving out an exit in the heavy cell door, and provides a sort of Greek chorus of fellow prisoners. This is Bresson's first film to feature a completely nonprofessional cast drilled to master precise movements and deliver lines without dramatic inflection. The effect is a drama where the slightest gesture carries the weight of a confession. Bresson's films are not for everybody, and this austere picture hardly carries the visceral punch ofThe Great Escape, but it's a drama of profound power, with a gripping climax that's as absorbing and tense as any  high-energy action film.--Sean Axmaker", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 525566}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 17.04, "brand": "", "asin": "6303077781", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21TF82JQ0JL.jpg", "title": "A Man Escaped [VHS]"}
{"description": "Few actresses have captivated the camera as powerfully as Dorothy  Dandridge inCarmen Jones. Her polished beauty plays in irresistible contrast to her title character's leonine sexuality and fluid emotions; a man can't decide from moment to moment if he wants to save her from doom, build her a castle, or never let her out of bed. Of course, that's the problem with the boys in this semi-experimental adaptation of Bizet's opera,Carmen. Straight-arrow Joe (a strapping Harry Belafonte), an obedient corporal on a Southern military base during World War&nbsp;II, is all set to go to flight school and marry his hometown sweetie, Cindy Lou (Olga James), when his troublemaking sergeant orders him to accompany Carmen to a civilian court. In short order, Joe is swept up in Carmen's carnal anarchy and her craving for  release from lousy options in life. An impulsive act of violence ensures that Joe's future is gone forever, putting Carmen in the difficult position of destroying their relationship to save him. Oscar Hammerstein II took  Bizet's music in 1943 and rewrote the book and lyrics. The result is largely a smashing success with a few missteps (the bullfighter in Bizet's piece becomes a heavyweight boxer here, which breaks up a certain grace in the  story) and a couple of perfect stretches (the long prelude to Carmen and Joe's first embrace, set on Carmen's home turf). Despite the fact that both Dandridge and Belafonte were singers, their vocal performances were  dubbed by LeVern Hutcherson and Marilyn Horne. (Yes, it is a little disconcerting to hear another voice come out of the more familiar Belafonte's mouth.) Otto Preminger directed with his usual eye on economy of action and production, as the numerous musical numbers tend to be shot in lengthy, single,  carefully choreographed takes. The result can be a little visually static at times, but the passion behind the singing pulls everything through.--Tom  Keogh", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 467747}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.65, "brand": "", "asin": "6303102425", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51TGP1S6K4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Carmen Jones [VHS]"}

Blue is the most somber of the three, a movie dominated by feelings of grief. As the film begins, a car accident claims the life of a well-known composer. His wife, played by Juliette Binoche (Oscar winner forThe English Patient), does not so much put the pieces of her life back together as start an entirely new existence. She moves to Paris, where she dissolves into a wordless life virtually without other people. Kieslowski attaches an almost subconscious significance to the color blue, but primarily he focuses on Binoche's luminous face, and the way her subtle shifts in emotion flicker and disappear.

You would think this an odd subject, but director Tim Burton harnesses the undying hopefulness that made Wood such a character.

Burton's recreation of Wood's wonderfully awfulPlan 9 from Outer Spacelooks much better than the original low-budget quickie. Burton tackled an extremely strange subject matter for a biopic, but Wood is presented as naive almost to the point of delusion, so the story works. The pace sags in the middle, as the weirdness starts to wear thin, but Depp proves himself an adroit actor, even while wearing angora and a blonde wig. Wood's unconventional repertoire company is faithfully reproduced, including an Academy Award-winning Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi.

Jackson skillfully captures the capricious moods and incredible intellect of the queen who defied the pope and the conventions of the time as a strong-willed woman, and characters from textbooks--Sir Francis Bacon, Sir Walter Raleigh, King Phillip II--come vividly to life.Elizabeth R(and for those not in the know, the \"R\" is for \"Regina\") is a splendid melding of history and entertainment, and as thorough as this series is, you will still long for more.--Jenny Brown", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302676185", "B000RF7XYY", "6302610702", "B000065Q9D", "6303980813", "B00004REFE"], "bought_together": ["6302676185"], "also_viewed": ["B004GJYRLY", "B0000048WH", "B000Z8H0IC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 345998}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 19.95, "brand": "", "asin": "630354231X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71V4RVX076L._SY300_.gif", "title": "Elizabeth R [VHS]"}

{"description": "A textbook example of '50s-era science fiction,Earth vs. the Flying Saucersboasts not only a solid script and competent performances, but some genuinely impressive stop-motion effects courtesy of one of the industry's uncontested masters, Ray Harryhausen. Scientist Hugh Marlowe (who faced a more benevolent invader from space five years earlier inThe Day the Earth Stood Still) discovers that UFOs are responsible for the destruction of a series of exploratory space rockets launched by his space exploration project. The saucers' helmeted pilots land on Earth and deliver an ultimatum to humanity via Marlowe: fealty or complete annihilation.Harryhausen's painstakingly intricate saucers and the destruction they wreak (particularly during an assault on Washington, D.C.) are the film's unquestionable highlights, but Marlowe and Joan Taylor (as his wife/partner) are capable leads, and veteran B director Fred F. Sears doesn't let the dialogue and expositional scenes fall apart in between the barrage of effects.Earth vs. the Flying Saucersis a fun and effective slice of sci-fi that should please younger audiences as well as nostalgic return viewers.

{"description": "If aliens came down to earth to see if humanity was worth saving, showing themShort Cuts, Robert Altman's bluesy riff on life in L.A. in the '90s, would not be a good idea. Based on the stories of Raymond Carver (adapted by Altman and Frank Barhydt), this ambitious film is a devilish valentine to living in L.A., where happiness comes at a premium. There are at least eight separate stories that crisscross, most about people who choose not to relate to the lives they are living. Seemingly by design, none of the stories (nor the performances for that matter) have more impact than the others--this is a true mosaic film. The most representative plot deals with a group of friends (Buck Henry, Fred Ward, and Huey Lewis) who decide to keep fishing even after discovering a body in the river. The story works as a morose comedy and a flag holder for the movie: the inability to take the correct action. Others would rather talk about seeing Alex Trebek than discuss their faltering relationships. A huge and talented cast twists in the wind, bumping into moments of truth, sex, and passion. Some even come out all right in the end. The accidental nature of life--a common theme in many Altman films--has never been so maddeningly persistent, or absorbing. The score by Mark Isham with songs sung by Annie Ross (also a cast member) fuels the moodiness, as does the opening number in which Medfly helicopters spray the town to the tune \"Prisoner of Life.\" Delivering the film a year after his biggest hit in two decades,The Player, Altman proved his artistic tenacity as an aged artist with the heart of a new filmmaker: he's not afraid of risking it all.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300181723", "B0001DHSHE"], "also_viewed": ["6301826558"]}, "price": 22.18, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 432267}, "asin": "6303995705", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51D5MBSWWML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Short Cuts [VHS]"}
{"description": "A suave tennis player (Ray Milland) plots the perfect murder, the dispatching of his wealthy wife (Grace Kelly), who is having an affair with a writer (Robert Cummings). Amazingly, the wife manages to stave off her attacker, a twist of fate that challenges the hubby's talent for improvisation. Alfred Hitchcock wisely stuck to the stage origins ofDial M for Murder, ignoring the temptation to \"open up\" the material from the home of the unhappy couple. The result may not be one of Hitchcock's deepest films, but it's a thoroughly engaging chamber movie. It also features Grace Kelly at her loveliest, the same year she madeRear Windowwith Hitchcock.Dial M for Murderwas filmed in the briefly trendy 3-D process, and Hitchcock shot some scenes to bring out the depth of the 3-D field; it's especially good for the nail-biting attempted murder of Kelly, and her desperate reach for a pair of scissors that seems to be just outside her grasp. However, the film was rarely shown with the proper 3-D projection, going out \"flat\" instead (a 1980 reissue restored the process for a limited theatrical release).Dial Mwas remade in 1998 asA Perfect Murder, a film that changed and expanded the material, with no improvement on the clean, witty original.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300183513", "0783236352", "0783221347", "1558807780", "6300215741", "0783235593", "0790743213", "0783235607", "6302413435", "6300183580", "6301798503", "6301670159", "6301670140", "6304039506", "6305123616", "6304359705", "6301975987", "6301586026", "6300215644", "6301800974", "6301976061", "630266232X", "6301977769", "B000021Y6K", "B00001OWYM", "6304119046", "6304119097", "6300181340", "6305012792", "6300215512", "B00004TRD5", "6301607929", "B000003KE0", "B0002IXSVI", "6301942639", "B00000I1EM", "0792839846", "6303364772", "B000GX7MMA", "6301647734", "0782006779", "6301971558", "0800113055", "6304111363", "6302360978", "0792107683", "6300214060", "0782008348", "6300215814", "6301977815", "6302797535", "6301973259", "B00000F13T", "B000PYKZYC", "0792110269", "0790733935", "B00000F3QZ", "B00000I1DI", "6301969316", "6304359721", "6302226899", "6300183890", "630150528X", "6302278929", "6301978110", "6300268594", "630522269X", "0800100832", "630236325X", "B00005RRG6"], "bought_together": ["0783236352"], "also_viewed": ["B002945DUM", "0790733935", "6301964012", "6300183513", "0783221347", "0790743213", "0783235593"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 178485}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 13.75, "brand": "", "asin": "6304039530", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51G9QYKZ8RL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Dial M for Murder [VHS]"}
{"description": "This true story of the black flyers who broke the color barrier in the U.S. Air Force during World War II is a well-intentioned film highlighted by an excellent cast. Proud, solemn, Iowa-born Laurence Fishburne and city-kid hipster Cuba Gooding Jr. are among the hopefuls who meet en route to Tuskegee Air Force Base, where they are among the recruits for an \"experimental\" program to \"prove\" the abilities of the black man in the U.S. armed services. Fighting prejudice from racist officers and government officials and held to a consistently higher level of performance than their white counterparts, these men prove themselves in training and in combat, many of them dying for their country in the process. Andre Braugher costars as a West Point graduate who takes charge of the unit in Africa and in Italy (where it's christened the 332nd). The film is rousing, if slow starting and episodic, but it's periodically grounded by a host of war movie clich&eacute;s, notably the calculated demise of practically every trainee introduced in the opening scenes (ironic given the 332nd's real-life combat record--high casualties for the enemy, low casualties among themselves, and no losses among the bombers they escorted). Ultimately the Emmy-nominated performances by moral backbone Fishburne and the dedicated Braugher and the energy and cocky confidence of Gooding give their battles both on and off the battlefield the sweet taste of victory.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000094J5T", "0790735431", "630018157X"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 372152}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 2.75, "brand": "", "asin": "6304039255", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515V2S5R95L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Tuskegee Airmen [VHS]"}

{"description": "Having developed his skill as a master of contemporary crime drama, writer-director Michael Mann displayed every aspect of that mastery in this intelligent, character-driven thriller from 1995, which also marked the first onscreen pairing of Robert De&nbsp;Niro and Al Pacino. The two great actors had played father and son in the separate time periods ofThe Godfather, Part&nbsp;II, but this was the first film in which the pair appeared together, and although their only scene together is brief, it's the riveting fulcrum of this high-tech cops-and-robbers scenario. De&nbsp;Niro plays a master thief with highly skilled partners (Val Kilmer and Tom Sizemore) whose latest heist draws the attention of Pacino, playing a seasoned Los Angeles detective whose investigation reveals that cop and criminal lead similar lives. Both are so devoted to their professions that their personal lives are a disaster. Pacino's with a wife (Diane Venora) who cheats to avoid the reality of their desolate marriage; De&nbsp;Niro pays the price for a life with no outside connections; and Kilmer's wife (Ashley Judd) has all but given up hope that her husband will quit his criminal career. These are men obsessed, and as De&nbsp;Niro and Pacino know, they'll both do whatever's necessary to bring the other down. Mann's brilliant screenplay explores these personal obsessions and sacrifices with absorbing insight, and the tension mounts with some of the most riveting action sequences ever filmed--most notably a daylight siege that turns downtown Los Angeles into a virtual war zone of automatic gunfire. At nearly three hours, the film qualifies as a kind of intimate epic, certain to leave some viewers impatiently waiting for more action, but it's all part of Mann's compelling strategy.Heatis a true rarity: a crime thriller with equal measures of intense excitement and dramatic depth, giving De&nbsp;Niro and Pacino a prime showcase for their finely matched talents.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000003KHS", "6300183211", "B00000IO4G", "630018627X", "6303421563", "B00000JGEI", "6302415853", "630018403X", "0800199421", "6304258984", "0784011923", "6304259131", "6302482712", "6303953425", "B00007CVYA", "0783223218", "6300214540", "6302054982", "0790731274", "B00000ILE6", "0792147618", "079073799X", "6301208773", "6301888901", "0790701251", "0792133153", "6302378648", "6302282535", "6305718792", "6304414099", "6303696813", "0790748169", "B0002ZDVFE", "B000077VT7", "6303269834", "6302516919", "630428649X", "B00008R9K9", "6303036570", "6302814782", "0792116887", "0792158261", "0790705141", "6304508611", "6301071379", "B00005Q4GY", "076783819X", "6300214567", "6303020089", "6303383300", "6302945089", "B0002GTWOM", "B00003CXE6", "0792841778", "6301797930", "0800116917", "0800179552", "B0000040EJ", "B00005A7VC", "6300182878"], "also_viewed": ["B000003KHS"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 286071}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.98, "brand": "", "asin": "6304214502", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4160ZFH45VL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Heat [VHS]"}
{"description": "Chungking Expresstells two stories loosely connected by a Hong Kong snack bar. In one story, a cop who's been recently dumped by his girlfriend becomes obsessed with the expiration dates on cans of pineapple; he's constantly distracted as he tries to track down a drug dealer in a blond wig (played by Brigitte Lin, best known fromSwordsman IIandThe Bride with White Hair). Meanwhile, another cop who's recently been dumped by his girlfriend (Tony Leung Chiu-Wai, from John Woo'sHard-BoiledandA Bullet in the Head) mopes around his apartment, talking to his sponge and other domestic objects. He catches the eye of a shop girl (Hong Kong pop star Faye Wang) who secretly breaks in and cleans his apartment. If you're beginning to suspect that neither of these stories has a conventional plot, you're correct. WhatChungking Expressdoes have is loads of energy and a gorgeous visual style that never gets in the way of engaging with the charming characters. The movie was shot on the fly by hip director Wong Kar-Wai (Happy Together,Ashes of Time), using only available lighting and found locations. The movie's loose, improvisational feel is closer to Jean-Luc Godard'sBreathlessthan any recent film--and that's high praise. Quirky, funny, and extremely engaging,Chungking Expressmanages to be experimental and completely accessible at the same time.--Bret Fetzer", "price": 7.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 417933}, "asin": "6304267835", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Y5M1X63JL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Chungking Express [VHS]"}

{"description": "Freewayis one of those movies that has the power to simultaneously amaze and disgust just about anyone who dares to view it. LikeSeven,Kalifornia, andNatural Born Killers, it's a movie that could be called a product of our times, since it caters to our societal fascination with serial killers and outrageous psychopathic behavior. But make no mistake: director Matthew Bright isn't out to feed anyone's sickest impulse. This is a scathing satire in the age of Jerry Springer fistfights and &quot;real&quot; TV shows likeCops, in which the &quot;I-5 Killer&quot; (Kiefer Sutherland) meets a wayward teenager (Reese Witherspoon) on the freeway that provides his nickname. She confides in the man but soon discovers his gruesome intentions, and ... well, let's just say she effectively defends herself, only to find later that the killer (whose wife is played by Brooke Shields, no less!) has used the media to his advantage.

{"description": "Romance at its most anti-romantic--that is the Billy Wilder stamp of genius, and this Best Picture Academy Award winner from 1960 is no exception. Set in a decidedly unsavory world of corporate climbing and philandering, the great filmmaker's trenchant, witty satire-melodrama takes the office politics of a corporation and plays them out in the apartment of lonely clerk C.C. Baxter (Jack Lemmon). By lending out his digs to the higher-ups for nightly extramarital flings with their secretaries, Baxter has managed to ascend the business ladder faster than even he imagined. The story turns even uglier, though, when Baxter's crush on the building's melancholy elevator operator (Shirley MacLaine) runs up against her long-standing affair with the big boss (a superbly smarmy Fred MacMurray). The situation comes to a head when she tries to commit suicide in Baxter's apartment. Not the happiest or cleanest of scenarios, and one that earned the famously caustic and cynically humored Wilder his share of outraged responses, but looking at it now, it is a funny, startlingly clear-eyed vision of urban emptiness and is unfailingly understanding of the crazy decisions our hearts sometimes make. Lemmon and MacLaine are ideally matched, and while everyone cites Wilder'sSome Like It Hotclosing line \"Nobody's perfect\" as his best, MacLaine's no-nonsense final words--\"Shut up and deal\"--are every bit as memorable. Wilder won three Oscars forThe Apartment, for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Screenplay (cowritten with longtime collaborator I.A.L. Diamond).--Robert Abele", "related": {"also_bought": ["1558807780", "6300216233", "6304039530", "0800113055", "6301607929", "6301973259", "6300183890", "6302226899", "6300183513", "6301973232", "6300268470", "6301670159", "6301798503", "6300215644", "630266232X", "6304039522", "0782008348", "0783236352", "B00000GJ2B", "6301670140", "0792108868", "630196912X", "0790743213", "B0000040EO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 362176}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.39, "brand": "", "asin": "6304308388", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51VQCSN36TL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Apartment [VHS]"}
{"description": "Veronica Sawyer (Winona Ryder) has sacrificed everything in order to preserve her place in Westerburg High's most impenetrable social clique, the HEATHERS. As the only member of the group not named \"Heather\", Veronica has to work extra hard just to stay afloat. Going against her own morals and intelligence, Veronica succumbs to peer pressure on a daily basis, faking her delight in the humiliation of the school's less popular students. Bored of the frat parties and cow tipping so popular among her friends, Veronica's curiosity is peaked when a mysterious new guy named J.D. comes to town. The dark, brooding J.D. (Christian Slater at his best) observes Veronica among her pack in the lunchroom (where social hierarchy is most clearly displayed), concluding that Veronica is not a Heather at heart. When Veronica confides in J.D. that she hates her friends and wishes Heather #1 was dead, she never expects her words to have such dire consequences. Before she knows what's happening, J.D. is dragging Veronica on a killing spree staged as a teen suicide outbreak. But as Veronica soon learns, even death cannot stop the HEATHERS. As one Heather dies, her red scrunchee (the symbol of all power) gets passed on to the next Heather in line, and the clique that was the HEATHERS starts to feel like an inescapable social disease. How far will this war for popularity go? By far the darkest of teen comedies, HEATHERS invented a vocabulary of teen-speak all its own, asking questions like \"What's your damage?\" and introducing phrases like \"How very\". Director Michael Lehmann successfully blends the horror, comedy, and teen movie genres, creating a truly original film. Full of dark humor and deeply sardonic messages, HEATHERS takes a fresh look at the often-sugarcoated cinematic world of high school. Set in the 1980's, the film feels timeless in its relevance because of the daring nature of its themes.", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300183416", "B00005T33W", "0767819586", "B000065RCD"], "bought_together": ["6300183416"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 590283}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.94, "brand": "", "asin": "6304361009", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51BZA4724XL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Heathers [VHS]"}

But even if it doesn't sound quite right to you, there are plenty of authentic and wonderful Brit thespians in this film by screenwriter-turned-director Douglas McGrath (co-author of Woody Allen'sBullets Over Broadway), including Juliet Stevenson  (Truly Madly Deeply), Alan Cumming  (Buddy), Phyllida Law (Much Ado About Nothing), Ewan McGregor (the Scots star ofTrainspotting), and Sophie Thompson, outstanding and finally heartbreaking as the chattering Miss Bates. Paltrow plays Austen's benign busybody, Emma Woodhouse--so busy trying to arrange the lives of others that she is sidestepping her own.

{"description": "\"The love impulse in man,\" says a psychiatrist inBringing Up Baby, \"frequently reveals itself in terms of conflict.\" That's for sure. For a primer on the rules and regulations of the classic screwball comedy, which throws love and conflict into close proximity, look no further. A straight-laced paleontologist (Cary Grant) loses a dinosaur bone to a dog belonging to free-spirited heiress Katharine Hepburn. In trying to retrieve said bone, Grant is drawn into the vortex surrounding the delicious Hepburn, which becomes a flirtatious pas de deux that will transform both of them. Director Howard Hawks plays the complications as a breathless escalation of their \"love impulse,\" yet the movie is nonetheless romantic for all its speed. (Hawks'sHis Girl Friday, also with Grant, goes even faster.) Grant and Hepburn are a match made in movie heaven, in sync with each other throughout. Not a great box-office success when first released,Bringing Up Babyhas since taken its place as a high-water mark of the screwball form, and it was used as a model for Peter Bogdanovich'sWhat's Up, Doc?--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301964012", "0790743213", "B0000040EO", "6301278410", "6300215628", "B0045HCJHG", "0780614097", "630290899X", "B000PYKZYC", "0792839846", "B002ZG988M", "630299005X", "0783235593", "0783222955", "0782006809", "6302227127", "6301798600", "6301647734", "6301797957", "0783221347", "6302278929", "B00004RFFA", "6304429274"], "bought_together": ["6301964012", "6300215628"], "also_viewed": ["B001GUYAZY", "6301826558", "B008D1Q1VU", "B007H7OQW2", "6301937112", "630197350X", "B0045HCJHG", "B006TTC5WC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 297012}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.27, "brand": "", "asin": "6304383177", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51TZGAV0X6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Bringing Up Baby [VHS]"}
{"description": "Tom Selleck shows a harder side of his persona as a disillusioned Confederate who returns home in the waning days of the Civil War in this adaptation of the Elmore Leonard novel. His wife, Suzy Amis, isn't ready to forgive him for leaving his family behind for the \"adventure\" of war, and his children hardly remember him. Haunted by his actions in the war and caught in a power struggle in the Arizona territory, Selleck's soul-scarred survivor makes a last stand to protect the only thing left that matters to him--his homestead and his family. The film has its share of gunfights, showdowns, conspiracies, and Civil War rivalries, and even a runaway stagecoach, but its power lies in the somber exploration of how misunderstandings and conflicts tear at a marriage during such a volatile time, when ideals are set against duty to family. Director Dick Lowry's lean style makes the most of the gorgeous landscapes, and he creates a strong dramatic tension in the bubbling undercurrent between Selleck, who leaves behind the jovial character of his Louis L'Amour Westerns for a man hardened and embittered by war, and Amis, an excellent actress who brings to life a woman who shoots, speaks her mind, and harbors resentment just as well as any brooding male hero.

{"description": "After Martin Scorsese went to Hollywood in 1972 to direct the low-budgetBoxcar Berthafor B-movie mogul Roger Corman, the young director showed the film to maverick director John Cassavetes and got an instant earful of urgent advice. \"It's crap,\" said Cassavetes in no uncertain terms, \"now go out and make something that comes from your heart.\" Scorsese took the advice and focused his energy onMean Streets, a riveting contemporary film about low-life gangsters in New York's Little Italy that critic Pauline Kael would later call \"a true original, and a triumph of personal filmmaking.\" Starring Robert De Niro and Harvey Keitel in roles that announced their talent to the world, it set the stage for Scorsese's emergence as one of the greatest American filmmakers. Introducing themes and character types that Scorsese would return to inTaxi Driver,GoodFellas,Casino, and other films, the loosely structured story is drawn directly from Scorsese's background in the Italian neighborhoods of New York, and it seethes with the raw vitality of a filmmaker who has found his creative groove. As the irresponsible and reckless Johnny Boy, De Niro offers striking contrast to Keitel's Charlie, who struggles to reconcile gang life with Catholic guilt. More of an episodic portrait than a plot-driven crime story,Mean Streetsremains one of Scorsese's most direct and fascinating films--a masterful calling card for a director whose greatness was clearly apparent from that point forward.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0790733927", "6302842263", "630026887X", "B000005PPB", "6302816629", "6301564456"], "also_viewed": ["6302066891", "6303534368"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 426972}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6304457375", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51CA63GNNXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Mean Streets [VHS]"}

{"description": "Halloweenis as pure and undiluted as its title.  In the small town of Haddonfield, Illinois, a teenage baby sitter  tries to survive a Halloween night of relentless terror, during which  a knife-wielding maniac goes after the town's hormonally charged  youths. Director John Carpenter takes this simple situation and  orchestrates a superbly mounted symphony of horrors. It's a movie much scarier for its dark spaces and ominous camera movements  than for its explicit bloodletting (which is actually minimal). Composed  by Carpenter himself, the movie's freaky music sets the tone; and his  script (cowritten with Debra Hill) is laced with references to other  horror pictures, especiallyPsycho. The baby sitter is played  by Jamie Lee Curtis, the real-life daughter ofPsychovictim  Janet Leigh; and the obsessed policeman played by Donald Pleasence  is named Sam Loomis, after John Gavin's character inPsycho.  In the end, though,Halloweenstands on its own as an  uncannily frightening experience--it's one of those movies that had  audiences literally jumping out of their seats and shouting at the  screen. (\"No! Don't drop that knife!\") Produced on a low budget,  the picture turned a monster profit, and spawned many sequels,  none of which approached the 1978 original. Curtis returned for two  more installments: 1981's dismalHalloween II, which picked  up the story the day after the unfortunate events, and 1998's occasionally  grippingHalloween H20, which proved the former baby sitter  was still haunted after 20 years.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005LC4Q", "B000FA57UI", "B000FA57US", "B000Q66Q2O", "B005CFC0N8", "B004P7CNUY", "B0000AOX09", "B004P7CM9Q", "B000VKL6Z2", "B00006LPHA", "B002XD0J80", "B00AQJ8MLY", "B001NPD9LS", "B002YICNE2", "B000GETUDI", "B000FS9FE4", "B001DJLD1W", "B00AEFY2LO", "B00006FI0R", "B00AEFY2WI", "B005CFBYW6", "B00006FDBT", "B00AEFY31S", "B00AEFY37C", "B00005K3NR", "B00004TS0G", "B003UGLCIA", "B0087ZG7UW", "B000I2J68M", "B000V4UFZK", "B0000VCZMK", "B0033B5XCS", "B000AM6OQ2", "B0002JP572", "B002VWNIDG", "B0058S0OMS", "B000099T3M", "B00AEFY1V0", "B002ZG971U", "B00AEFYYH6", "B00003CXCF", "B004LWZW2O", "B001B1UO6W", "B00006FDCD", "B000E1ZBIG", "B004SIP9MY", "B000TSIJWY", "B000WC3864", "B004AC6PMG", "B001DJLD0S", "B000QQJ3Q0", "B004P7CMT6", "B0002CHK1S", "B000FC2GA0", "B008CYDD7I", "B0008191WO", "B0024FADD8", "B0053TWVDC", "B00018D42W", "B00AEFY2AA", "B00DTPRZ24", "B000KJU1KK", "B00AEFY2E6", "B0000CEB6Y", "B0006SGYL0", "B00004Y87O", "B0013D8LAE", "B00005JA8B", "B006ZL1P66", "B000GBEWRU", "B000IMUYJM", "B005J9ZFQG", "B001JFZ1UE", "B007STBUHI", "B000E8M0P6", "6305972001", "B00079Z9WI", "B00005A8XX", "B00009PY4G", "B000FAOC2W", "B000AA4JL6", "B0002C4JJ4", "B0002O7XW2", "B008JFUNYG", "B000HEWEGC", "B002LMSWN2", "B00BM4Q4H6", "B000HCO86I", "B008874968", "0783227434", "B0006SSOHC", "B001JFZ122", "B004LWZW24", "B000Q66Q8I", "B00001QGUM", "B000OYCMLM", "B000PMLJMQ", "B00000ILDD", "B00A1AU72A", "B004SIP9E2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00KDU8HQQ", "B00005LC4Q", "B000VKL6Z2", "B002YICNE2"]}, "price": 19.96, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 349265}, "asin": "6304697961", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51NXT68J3CL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Halloween"}

{"description": "Asian American director Ang Lee sums up America in the early 1970s by focusing on the arrival of the sexual revolution in the 'burbs. Isolationism within a family, consumerism, and selfishness are personified by a cast that captures the self-obsession within two New England families. As the children struggle awkwardly with adolescence, their parents stumble through sexual experimentation. In the days of Watergate and Vietnam, society is breaking boundaries and ignoring convention. Following suit, these families are eschewing polite barriers and social taboos, with disastrous results. The \"ice storm\" of the title refers not only to a natural phenomenon but is a (rather heavy-handed) metaphor for a pervasive emotional temperament. The entire cast delivers textured, finely nuanced performances. This movie lingers in the psyche not only for the scope of the tragedy at its conclusion, but for Lee's often humorous and stingingly accurate assessment of pop culture. Based on Rick Moody's novel, this won the best-screenplay award at Cannes in 1997.--Rochelle O'Gorman", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 146644}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.0, "brand": "", "asin": "6304844964", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4125A7MPSWL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Ice Storm [VHS]"}
{"description": "Actually, this comedy is one of the more enjoyable films to examine midlife crisis in the 1980s. Written and directed by Alan Alda, it examines the effects of middle age on a group of married couples who are longtime friends. Each season they go away on a vacation together, but the dynamic gets skewed when one of the men dumps his wife for a younger woman. Though some may find the characters' self-satisfaction and upscale neuroses a shade cloying, they are more than matched by Alda's solid, often funny writing. The couple with the biggest laughs: the hilariously paired Jack Weston and Rita Moreno (although Alda and Carol Burnett also strike comic sparks).--Marshall Fine", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 415328}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.76, "brand": "", "asin": "6304910150", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71R6CSQRTYL._SY300_.gif", "title": "The Four Seasons [VHS]"}

{"description": "This popular and beloved film, produced by Tsui Hark and  directed by Ching Siu Tung, is a standout in the Hong Kong supernatural-action genre and spawned many sequels and copycats.A Chinese Ghost Storystars Leslie Cheung as Ning Tsei-Shen, a timid and likable tax collector. Looking for a place to stay the night, he comes upon a spooky abandoned temple occupied by a tough Taoist swordsman (Ma Wu).  Despite his  warnings, Tsei-Shen stays anyway.  Later he encounters a beautiful maiden (Joey  Wang) who he quickly falls in love with.  Unfortunately, she is a ghost who  is being forced to trap men for an evil spirit who feeds on their souls.A Chinese Ghost Storyhas been widely praised for infusing the genre  with humor, action, romance, and inventive special effects. Memorable images include an attacking mile-long tongue and a cloak opening to dozens of ghastly decapitated heads. The final battle in hell is said to have inspired scenes in Sam Raimi'sArmy of Darkness.  And the film  has its share of homage: A group of crusty zombies are reminiscent of the skeletons in special-effects guru Ray Harryhausen's7th Voyage of Sinbad--and they are eliminated by Tsei-Shen in comedic slapstick fashion, not unlike the style of Charlie Chaplin. Cheung and Wang are a likeable romantic pair, and Ma Wu creates a hilarious character who  breaks out into song and a martial arts dance when drunk. The DVD transfer is  topnotch, with the film's misty mood lighting and fluttering gowns appearing layered and crisp.

{"description": "A lovely, liltingsoundtrackof samba and bossa nova melodies gently guides this charming movie about Erin (Hope Davis), a young nurse adrift in her life. When her boyfriend, a hyperactive political activist played by the amazing Philip Seymour Hoffman (Boogie Nights,Happiness), leaves her, Erin struggles to find serenity on her own. Meanwhile, her mother schemes to find her a new boyfriend by placing a personal ad for Erin without her knowledge.Next Stop Wonderlandjuxtaposes this with the story of Alan (Alan Gelfant), a plumber struggling to get a degree as a marine biologist. The movie weaves all sorts of hints about fate and destiny, so it's no surprise at the end when Erin and Alan meet--but the fun is in getting there. In addition to the well-drawn characters and sharp, clever writing (the sequence of personal-ad dates that Erin goes on is both funny and painful), the movie is full of visual grace notes. For example, while at a bar, Alan spills a drink on a newspaper; the wet newsprint becomes translucent and reveals a photo of Erin that was taken at an aquarium fundraiser and printed in the society page. But before Alan even sees it, his friends scoop up the wet paper and throw it away. These moments have a casual, tossed-off air that evokes a lightly mystical sense of how our lives float on a thousand invisible coincidences. More than anything else, the movie spotlights Hope Davis's intelligence and quiet soulfulness.

Ever had to endure a smarmy, condescending boss? ThenOffice Spaceshould hit pretty close to home for you. Peter (Ron Livingston) spends the day doing stupefyingly dull computer work in a cubicle. He goes home to an apartment sparsely furnished by IKEA and Target, then starts for a maddening commute to work again in the morning. His coworkers in the cube farm are an annoying lot, his boss is a snide, patronizing jerk, and his days are consumed with tedium. In desperation, he turns to career hypnotherapy, but when his hypno-induced relaxation takes hold, there's no shutting it off. Layoffs are in the air at his corporation, and with two coworkers (both of whom are slated for the chute) he devises a scheme to skim funds from company accounts. The scheme soon snowballs, however, throwing the three into a panic until the unexpected happens and saves the day. Director Mike Judge has come up with a spot-on look at work in corporate America circa 1999.

{"description": "Most generation gaps focus on conservative parents and radical kids, butMy Son the Fanaticdepicts the opposite: taxi driver Parvez (Om Puri) can't understand why his son has turned to Muslim fundamentalism, calling the Western world of their corner of London corrupt and driven by sex. Meanwhile, Parvez finds himself working for a hedonistic German businessman (Stellan Skarsg&aring;rd fromBreaking the WavesandGood Will Hunting) who has more or less hired a prostitute named Bettina (Rachel Griffiths fromHilary and JackieandChildren of the Revolution), with whom Parvez has become friends. As Parvez's wife also turns towards fundamental ways, and a Muslim holy man comes to live in their house, Parvez turns more and more to Bettina for solace. Their friendship turns more intimate, bringing the family conflict to a head. This could be little more than a midlife crisis fantasy, butMy Son the Fanaticthickens its story with cultural details and well-developed characters. The performances are rich and affecting; Om Puri is charming and sympathetic, and makes Parvez's moral conflicts genuine and understandable. Though Bettina, as a hooker with a heart of gold, is  a bit of a stereotype, Griffiths's integrity as an actress makes the character compelling. An affecting film that doesn't provide easy answers to the difficult questions it explores.

He has been allowed a second chance at life after a long stay in a mental institution and returns to the streets where he grew up; sent to a halfway house under the stern but unsupervised watch of Mrs.Wilkenson (Lynn Redgrave). The sights, sounds and smells of revisiting the familiar streets of his old neighborhood send Spider further down a shadowy path that reawakens memories of his where his mother (Miranda Richardson) and his father (Gabriel Byrne) raised him. He soon begins to uncover the real truth shifting seamlessly back and forth between the tragic events that polarized a boy's adolescence to the shell of a man enduring the surreal plausible reality of today.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0009298N4", "B004SUDQ72", "B0001XAKUQ", "B00AEFXR8I", "B0000CDUT5", "B000FUF9O2", "B00000JSJC", "B00LEW3L5Y", "B00009PY2T", "B00JQYV0B4", "0783228457", "0679736301", "B000H5U5RG", "B006PTL1QM", "0767847415", "B0009X768W", "B000CQLZ0Q", "B000C65Z1G", "B004QDRW0S", "B009ERK35W", "B009T3AHDE", "B000ERVJQ8", "B006PTL1GC", "B0000AUHPK", "B00012QLB4", "B0007P0X9G", "B00DDY44C0", "078401213X", "B001JNNE1O", "B004SIP7F8", "B006KH6CF4", "B00005JKJA", "0780619587", "B009T3AE1Y", "B00066FB3O", "B00005ALMM", "B000YENUI6", "B00006RCNV", "B0059XTUR2", "B000063JDE", "B003Y5H4R0", "B00D3DJIG8", "0743451791", "B00K72HVBC", "6305428522", "B00005B6L0", "B00005JLRE", "B001EIOOWC", "B002P7UCJK", "B00GKOJ98E", "B00K0MM4AM", "1560974273", "B000QQFKYE", "B0000AKCM0", "B00B2BYXSG", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B001FOK70S", "B00HRYH52I", "B0041KT3P8", "B000FVQLQQ", "0790738511", "B0018O4YT0", "B00003CXZ4", "B007C3TVNA", "B000056BP1", "B00HE011DE", "B001152TL6", "B000E8N8M0", "B00009ATIX", "B0001NBLX6", "B00HVOFP6W", "B0002JZT5A", "B00003CXQ4", "B00HF00RJW", "B005HV6Y5W", "B0002DB52M", "B00HOGBXS6", "B00005JLKN", "B00HT2RTU6", "B000NIVJFY", "B000QXDCLK", "B00067BBMI", "B000MNOXZ8", "B0002KQNKE", "B00000K3TS", "B00008RH3J", "B004SIP6VI", "B00079HZQQ", "B001PPLJIQ", "B00JPUUQVE", "B007I1Q4W2", "145168939X", "B000021Y7L", "B0007Q6VXC", "B003KGBIRK", "B000WC39ZY", "0783225903", "B001TK80CU", "B004LXBKEC", "B00000IC7G"], "bought_together": ["B0009298N4", "B00AEFXR8I"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0009298N4", "B00000JSJC", "B00FQPLZ08", "B004SUDQ72"]}, "price": 16.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 128016}, "asin": "B00000F4MA", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51BYABYMT7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Spider"}
{"description": "There's no rule against rock anthems from the 1970s in the soundtrack for a movie about a medieval jousting champion, but if you're going to attempt such jarring anachronisms, you'd better establish acceptable ground rules. Writer-director Brian Helgeland does precisely that inA Knight's Taleand pulls off this trick with such giddy aplomb that you can't help but play along. (Upon witnessing a crowd of peasants at a jousting match, singing and clapping to the beat of Queen's \"We Will Rock You,\" you're either going to love this movie or dismiss it altogether.) Other vintage rock hits will follow, but Helgeland--the Oscar&#xAE;-winning cowriter ofL.A. Confidential--handles this ploy with judicious goodwill, in what is an otherwise honest period piece about a peasant named William (Heath Ledger) who rises by grit and determination to the hallowed status of knighthood.As if the soundtrack weren't audacious enough, Helgeland (recovering from the sour experience of his directorial debut,Payback) casts none other than Geoffrey Chaucer (wonderfully played by Paul Bettany) as William's cohort and match announcer, along with William's pals Roland (Mark Addy) and Wat (Alan Tudyk), and feisty blacksmith Kate (Laura Fraser). Of course there must be a fair maiden, and she is Jocelyn (newcomer Shannyn Sossamon), with whom William falls in love while battling the nefarious Count Adhemar (Rufus Sewell) on the European jousting circuit. Add to this an inspiring father-son reunion, Ledger's undeniable charisma, a perfect supporting cast, and enough joyful energy to rejuvenate the film's formulaic plot, andA Knight's Talebecomes that most pleasant of movie surprises--an unlikely winner that rises up, like its hero, to exceed all expectations.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000EDWKXI", "0800141601", "B00447L4KA", "B00006ZXSK", "B004SEUIWY", "B002VWNID6", "B00004XPPG", "B00003CXC3", "B00005EBIL", "B000ARXF96", "B00AEFXKUI", "B004SUDQ40", "B001HN69AY", "B004SIP9U6", "0792839137", "B0002YLCG0", "B003UYUQZW", "B003FCKIGQ", "B000056VP4", "B002NZK5V4", "B00005JLO2", "B002O3Z50Q", "B002O3Z4XY", "B00AEFY5B6", "B000GGSMO4", "6305428077", "B00003CXG7", "B00004WG2F", "B00005JN0T", "B0010V4VJY", "B005ORVN00", "B00000JQB5", "6305428042", "6305123454", "0783225814", "B00AEBB9UU", "6305692688", "B0000WN0SW", "B000MGUZCU", "B00006ADFM", "B00005JKCH", "B00AMEZDJW", "B0000TPA0G", "B0000844I8", "B002GHHHHO", "0783240295", "B000K7VHQ4", "B00000K3UU", "B00005JKMN", "B000EPFCPE", "B0006GAI5U", "B0007IO6NM", "B002K0WBXW", "0767821513", "B00005QJJG", "B00008EYA5", "B00004Z4WR", "B00005JKNV", "B00005LOL0", "B004SIP6BI", "B00003CXHJ", "B002NXSRVG", "B002ZG999U", "B004SEUJ9Q", "0783233477", "B000T5O47Q", "B00F84H73Q", "B003U0AHBO", "B00004W4UD", "B00AEFXYOA", "B000AARKOO", "B00AEFZ6V4", "B00005JM5B", "B0001HLVS2", "6305428387", "B002GHHHME", "B000LC55F2", "B00AEBB8R4", "B007SPPANM", "B001GZ6QC4", "B00BLN4V46", "B000EGDB10", "0800195175", "B000FKO5QK", "B000U7WV1Y", "B00BTYSIWI", "B0038N9X3Q", "6305609764", "B000K4WPCC", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B00011CZRE", "B00005JMOW", "0800141741", "B00005JPD0", "B001DDBD4K", "B00008G7UF", "B000209KMW", "1558908382", "B004LWZWGA", "B0009RCPUW"], "bought_together": ["B00447L4KA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0800141601", "B00447L4KA", "B00003CXC3"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 7604}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.99, "brand": "Columbia Telecommunications", "asin": "B00000F4ZY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51rNtZ4oMwL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "A Knight's Tale (Special Edition)"}
{"description": "This DVD is packed with extras designed for kids and special-effects enthusiastics. Stuart himself hosts the extras, guiding the viewer through the special menus. A favorite with the kids will probably be the game asking questions about the movie. Using clips from the movie and three different levels, it's quite appealing. As for meatier things, there is a curious look at animators' \"tryouts\" in creating Stuart, plus excellent demonstrations of how Stuart interacts with humans, using multiple images and commentary. Another highlight is seeing the first conceptual drawings of the boat race, vastly different from the final sequence. There are two commentary tracks on the film, one with the visual-effects team revealing their secrets and the other with the engaging director, Rob Minkoff. Also including  short documentaries, music videos, and a read-along book with Stuart,  this is a rare disc because the kids will like the extras as much as the film.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JLGM", "B000M343BC", "B00003CXJ4", "B000CQ98FU", "B00AEFXMSS", "B004HO6I4M", "B0006JMLRK", "B002WJI2QQ", "B000MV9026", "B0012EM5D8", "B001DPHDCY", "B004EPZ034", "6305161887", "B00005JNQS", "0783231474", "B005SDUV4E", "B0006UEVT0", "B00CWM58WY", "B0000AOX0O", "B000065V42", "B00000JL8E", "B0000VV4W2", "B005F96UJ6", "B00029LO0Y", "0783219806", "0783219733", "B0000VCZKW", "B00H5NY7O0", "B0000AK7AB", "B00009YXAW", "B000RMJ4F8", "B00AEFYO08", "B00GT85OLC", "B00005JG6M", "B000UVKGPI", "B000XKW2WG", "B003L4Y5BW", "B001U3D88M", "0064400565", "B00005JM7T", "B000ION23A", "B007FF3HQM", "B0006J28MI", "B000EOMB9U", "B0018ATR2S", "B00005LB87", "B002GHHHNS", "B001GCUNWQ", "B005LAIIT4", "B003R2BWJG", "B00005JMQZ", "B000056H26", "B000LPS2VI", "B0084IHVUC", "B004LWZW9W", "B008R65XKG", "B00EBBGLFC", "B00028HBES", "B0030ZIZRC", "B004AKCME8", "B00AEFXMGU", "B001LPWGFA", "0783232292", "B0000VCZKM", "B005LAIISA", "B000U1ZV5I", "B000NQRV4Y", "B000CZ0PT4", "B00JK531ES", "B008R65XPQ", "B001P4Q3CY", "B0000UJDLM", "B00003CXG7", "B00B7EQPNE", "B001ILFUD2", "B000J10FLY", "B000AY74OG", "B0042U94UQ", "B00CTNYLQA", "B00K2CHSS8", "B008NNY9QW", "B00006LPHB", "B000V5IP6U", "B00HLTD2OE", "B0009NZ2KG", "B000P0J09W", "B00365F6I2", "B000A2WAQK", "B00F522C7C", "B007R6DJP8", "B0087F7VSY", "B000Y11B7G", "B0039N74CW", "B00005JMFH", "B0016Q2D5M", "B003H9M1Q2", "B00005JLR2", "B000H5TH2A", "B00DV2MVWO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004HO6I4M", "B00CWM58WY", "B004EPZ034", "B000H5TH2A"]}, "price": 12.86, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 149960}, "asin": "B00000F7AE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51YZM5J2MJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Stuart Little (Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "Punch-Drunk Loveis nottypical Superbit fare, but the higher bit rate does beautifully present cinematographer Robert Elswit's striking colors, including the Jeremy Blake art.

A 12-minute piece, \"Blossoms & Blood,\" compiles some alternate takes of events in the Barry-Lena relationship accompanied by Jon Brion's music, and 12 scopitones and a 2.5-minute segment showcase more art and music.  There are also two unremarkable alternate scenes plus a mock commercial for Philip Seymour Hoffman's Mattress Man character that will make you wince and probably laugh.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00003CWTI", "B000PAAJZ6", "B008220DGE", "B002QFYJF4", "B00AEBB9CS", "1573625574", "B001P3SA8K", "B000QFCCR8", "B008220DIC", "B00000K3D3", "B00005JLRE", "0783227345", "B00008WI9N", "B002LVVCJY", "B00332F3MW", "B00005BCK9", "B002PLPQLU", "B00112S8RS", "B0014GI6I2", "B00005JMJG", "B00000IC7G", "B00007AJF8", "B0000BXMZ8", "B00AEBBAEU", "B00008K7AO", "B00005NGAY", "B000E33VWW", "B00008RH3J", "B00005JKJA", "B0013XZ2QK", "B001P3SA8A", "B00006CXGZ", "B00005JMJ4", "B0007UC8Y4", "6305428239", "6305803765", "B004SIP71M", "B0000640VJ", "B0007OCG56", "B003102JDM", "B0006GW2JU", "B0060ZJ7DA", "0767821408", "B0006TPE4C", "B000CS464G", "B00003CXPS", "0767830555", "B00AQBDU4Q", "B00008RH3L", "6305781095", "B0000C8ROV", "B00979KQ4U", "B00006RCNV", "B000FVQM2Y", "B0010X8NF0", "B000063JDE", "B00H9HZITU", "B00320J6WS", "B00005JM4Q", "B002ZG97T2", "B00BTYMPX6", "B00005JMW7", "B0009W5IMO", "B00GMV8KGW", "B000N6TX1I", "B002E2M5IC", "B00112S8S2", "B00AEBB8SS", "B000BX8R10", "B004SIP73U", "B001FB55MG", "B00AQTY3JO", "B00AEBB89W", "B00H9HZGQ0", "B001B1UO7G", "B0011NVC8Y", "B005KKVAHW", "B00AEFXE9U", "B000092T3X", "B00AEFXE3Q", "B004SIP8ZM", "B0006GAOJA", "B00AEFXESQ", "B0035G5IOE", "1557044066", "B000286RP2", "B00386OWUC", "B00GMV8L1Q", "B000QFCCRI", "B00005NC66", "B000ELJAEM", "B000CSUNQQ", "B00003CXGA", "B00005AUJK", "B00005JPAR", "B00005QAPH", "B00000ING2", "B0024FADCE", "B00AEFXN9G", "B000VXWX7E"], "bought_together": ["B00003CWTI", "B000PAAJZ6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B008220DGE", "B000PAAJYW", "B000PAAJZ6", "B001P3SA8K"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 37835}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.15, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B00000G02H", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZDG4AGVPL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Punch-Drunk Love (Two-Disc Special Edition)"}
{"description": "Italian shock maven Lucio Fulci directed this effort, undoubtedly one of his seediest and most offensive films. A serial killer prowls the streets of New York, preying strictly on women and butchering them in the most sadistic ways (usually starting at the crotch). The cops are always several steps behind the killer, who uses a Donald Duck voice to taunt them (and his prospective victims) over the phone. It's all pretty misogynistic, violent, and brutal, and adds up to an unsavory viewing experience. That said, the plot hangs together fairly well (better than in much of thegiallogenre), and Fulci's camera work and editing are topnotch. The director's sense of color and shot composition are in line with much of contemporaries Dario Argento and Mario Bava's work (the color red in particular dominates much of the movie). As with Argento's work, an unassuming woman, caught up in circumstances, turns out to be the film's heroine. Also, it's interesting that both in this film and inDon't Torture a Duckling, Fulci uses Donald Duck as a sort of bizarre totem of shattered innocence and tragedy. Still, Fulci uses his camera here in such a leering, lascivious way that it reinforces the film's oppressive sleaziness and sadism. Fans of Italian horror won't be disappointed withThe New York Ripper, but be advised that the movie's overriding unpleasantness makes it an acquired taste at best.--Jerry Renshaw", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00001U0GS", "079284632X"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 512276}, "asin": "B00000K0DU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51SFCGXQNJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The New York Ripper [VHS]"}

{"description": "With this magnificent Criterion DVD release, Luchino Visconti's 1963 historical dramaThe Leopardwill finally earn widespread recognition as one of the most beautiful epics ever produced. In adapting the popularnovelby Giuseppe Tomassi di Lampedusa (an Italian equivalent toGone with the Wind, set during the tumultuous Garibaldi revolution of 1860-62), Visconti was initially reluctant to cast Burt Lancaster as the melancholy Prince of Salina--the aging aristocrat \"leopard\" of the title--who accepts change as inevitable during the struggle for a unified Italy. But Lancaster (even with his voice dubbed in the fully restored Italian release) delivered one of his finest performances, modeled after Visconti himself, and reacting to political and familial upheavals with the wisdom and whimsy of a man who knows that his way of life--and all he holds dear--must change with the times. You won't find a more intimate epic, and Giusseppe Rotunno's masterful cinematography represents the pinnacle of painterly beauty, matched only by the authentic splendor of the film's impeccable production design. The climactic hourlong ballroom scene--which even the hard-to-please Pauline Kael called \"one of the greatest of all passages in movies\"--is utterly breathtaking. Anchored by Lancaster's performance and the romantic pairing of Alain Delon and Claudia Cardinale,The Leopardis sheer perfection, fully restored to its 185-minute glory.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0375714790", "B003VA3JTK", "B00782O7LG", "B004CIIXDC", "B001NH4CIA", "B0012KOM6K", "067940757X", "B009DA73WG", "B001LMU1C8", "B00005BHW6", "B00005QAPH", "B00009ME9Z", "B006MHZFGY", "6305081034", "B0000WN10O", "B000IHYXH6", "B0007M222A", "B006MHZ46A", "B00005JKGO", "B0007989Y8", "B002U6DVQ2", "B009D004TA", "B0009HLCTC", "B000AQKUG8", "B0002DB4YQ", "B001C0I626", "B005HK13S6", "B000305ZYS", "B000G8NXYQ", "1590177193", "8807883821", "B00AQ6J64O", "B00000IOKV", "B003ICZW8M", "B00005UQ7T", "B006LAB8RW", "B008CJ0JS4", "B000I0RNV6", "0312426844", "B00005AUKD", "B00DHN8GGW", "B004ODLUIU", "B000E3L7L4", "B00DZP1BUU", "B00005NC66", "B00B2BYXSQ", "B00005BCJZ", "B00092ZLEY", "B00007CVS3", "B008Y5OXB0", "B00AQ6J6H6", "B00128R94Y", "B00005EBSF", "B000AQKUH2", "B005VU9LP4", "B00HRJVHEK", "B0007989ZC", "B006MHZ32K", "B0006Z2NB8", "B001CW7ZSU", "B0000WN0ZK", "B00598OA2C", "6305257450", "B00AEFXG2U", "B00DHN8FXG", "B000C8Q900", "B001LMU19G", "B00065GX64", "B00005QAPJ", "B000NOK0GW", "B008Y5OWSO", "B0057GYODG", "B003VA3JTA", "B00005NFZD", "B003ICZW7I", "B0000BUZKP", "B00005V6N6", "0312597053", "B000E3L7M8", "B000BB14IA", "B00AQ6J5YA", "B0000687DE", "B00005JKFX", "B000092T5D", "B00003CXXY", "B000G8NXYG", "B005152C7S", "B0009XRZMY", "B001BEK8C4", "B00005A8TU", "B002Y26UJW", "B0026VBOJW", "B001BEK8E2", "B00192QJQC", "B00004XQN5", "B000FUF7D0", "B0001ZIVAA", "B0083V2W04", "B0000A02TX"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0375714790", "B00782O7LG", "B003VA3JTK", "B00005QAPH"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 183789}, "asin": "B00003CWQL", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4102A8XWBEL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Leopard (The Criterion Collection)"}
{"description": "As the triumphant start of a trilogy,The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ringleaves you begging for more. By necessity, Peter  Jackson's ambitious epic compresses J.R.R. Tolkien's classicThe Lord of the Rings,  but this robust adaptation maintains reverent allegiance to Tolkien's creation,  instantly qualifying as one of the greatest fantasy films ever made. At 178  minutes, it's long enough to establish the myriad inhabitants of Middle-earth,  the legendary Rings of Power, and the fellowship of hobbits, elves, dwarves, and  humans--led by the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and the brave hobbit Frodo  (Elijah Wood)--who must battle terrifying forces of evil on their perilous  journey to destroy the One Ring in the land of Mordor. Superbly paced, the film  is both epic and intimate, offering astonishing special effects and production  design while emphasizing the emotional intensity of Frodo's adventure. Ending on  a perfect note of heroic loyalty and rich anticipation, this wondrous fantasy  continues inThe Two Towers(2002).--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JKZV", "B00005JKZY", "B00BEZTMFY", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B005COPWZW", "B00005JM5E", "B002ZG980U", "B002PMV9FG", "B001GZ6QC4", "B007K3JFUQ", "B000U7WV1Y", "B00005JNJV", "B001OQCV6A", "B004M1A21K", "B008UZ7MYY", "B00HFFE8HE", "B000A9QKLO", "B000E8M0VA", "B000W7F5SS", "B0014C2FX8", "0618640150", "B001DHXT20", "B00E5I2M6I", "B00003CX5P", "B0013FDM7E", "B00AZMFJYA", "B00005QZWI", "B0019L770A", "B000I0RQVI", "B002IPFWTE", "B001CDR1FG", "B0006UEVT0", "B003TT2X6S", "B001OQCV2E", "B009JBWOU0", "B00005JL78", "B00005JNOG", "B001UV4XHY", "B00CNW9ZI6", "B00GKOJ98E", "0345325818", "B0014Z4ON4", "B000H30B2C", "B005LXQLRW", "B001UV4XIS", "B001GCUO1Q", "B00CZDLGDU", "0345538374", "B004LWZW42", "B007REV4T8", "B000W746GK", "B00005JPH2", "B003TT2X72", "B004LWZWGA", "B0087ZG7J8", "B005G4TJUC", "B003ZK99NQ", "B00006HBUJ", "B008UZA8FY", "B0090SI56Y", "B000VI70QS", "B00005JNC2", "B004WCTLNY", "B0014Z4OMU", "6305313687", "B004AKCME8", "B000E6EK2Y", "0547928211", "B000LC55F2", "B0002KVUKM", "B000FQJAIW", "B008JFUO72", "B000FIMG68", "B005LAIHSG", "B005LAIIT4", "B004AOECXI", "B00029RTCG", "B000P0J0EM", "B002HWRYJE", "B0060FXDCG", "B001ECQ75A", "0792839749", "B00AEFXZJE", "B005LAII0I", "B0042U94UQ", "B001HN6918", "B00008G8M5", "B008JFURII", "B003ZKBELG", "B000P0J09W", "B003XURDAY", "B00335EQ0E", "B00008G8M4", "0547928203", "B000W796OM", "B00006ADD5", "B00J49R1BY", "B00B04NIZO", "B00G5G7EXY", "B00001ZWUS"], "bought_together": ["B00005JKZV", "B00005JKZY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00HFFE8HE", "B00005JKZY", "B00BEZTMFY", "B00005JKZV"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 3641}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.49, "brand": "NEW Line Home Video", "asin": "B00003CWT6", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Dj%2BQ1hLBL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)"}
{"description": "Before it ever arrived in the U.S., this epic, animated 1997 fantasy had already made history as the top-grossing domestic feature ever released in Japan, where its combination of mythic themes, mystical forces, and ravishing visuals tapped deeply into cultural identity and contemporary, ecological anxieties. For international animation andanimefans,Princess Mononokerepresents an auspicious next step for its revered creator, Hayao Miyazaki (My Neighbor Totoro,Kiki's Delivery Service), an acknowledgedanimepioneer, whose painterly style, vivid character design, and stylized approach to storytelling take ambitious, evolutionary steps here.Set in medieval Japan, Miyazaki's original story envisions a struggle between nature and man. The march of technology, embodied in the dark iron forges of the ambitious Tatara clan, threatens the natural forces explicit in the benevolent Great God of the Forest and the wide-eyed, spectral spirits he protects. When Ashitaka, a young warrior from a remote, and endangered, village clan, kills a ravenous, boar-like monster, he discovers the beast is in fact an infectious \"demon god,\" transformed by human anger. Ashitaka's quest to solve the beast's fatal curse brings him into the midst of human political intrigues as well as the more crucial battle between man and nature.Miyazaki's convoluted fable is clearly not the stuff of kiddie matinees, nor is the often graphic violence depicted during the battles that ensue. If some younger viewers (or less attentive older ones) will wish for a diagram to sort out the players, Miyazaki's atmospheric world and its lush visual design are reasons enough to watch. For the English-language version, Miramax assembled an impressive vocal cast including Gillian Anderson, Billy Crudup (as Ashitaka), Claire Danes (as San), Minnie Driver (as Lady Eboshi), Billy Bob Thornton, and Jada Pinkett Smith. They bring added nuance to a very different kind of magic kingdom. Recommended for ages 12 and older.--Sam Sutherland", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JLEU", "B000CDGVOE", "B0001XAPZ6", "B002ZTQV8Y", "B002ZTQVHK", "B002ZTQVLG", "B004CRR9G0", "B002ZTQVGQ", "B006LLY8LY", "B0001XAPY2", "B0006J28BO", "B005LAIGX2", "B00CSYR432", "B000CDGVOO", "B004CRR9EW", "B0009MAO3W", "B00BEYYEJ4", "B00BEYYEIK", "B00ENNO1E6", "B00CSYRHG6", "B007JNTOBC", "B008XEZXRA", "B002ZTQVBQ", "B00ENNBZ68", "B007JNTPSO", "B00ENNUC9Y", "6304493681", "B005LAIGXM", "B00CJ7Y0US", "B00B1RB942", "B00441GYS8", "B00ENNA62W", "B00102FF7U", "B008XEZXYI", "B0009MAO3M", "B00AUJH32E", "B0023S49YU", "B000VWYJ68", "B003NF97M6", "B0030ZOYHC", "B009AVC922", "B000TGCR3I", "B001XUTVLK", "B0009P42S2", "B00D44IQQE", "B001DXPWO2", "B005OK0YUC", "B007DBM40S", "B00EJYAWS8", "B004GZZH6W", "0061478784", "B0001EFTVA", "B004R0MF0M", "B004EC5IUW", "B0049TC8AI", "B00CJ7Y19I", "B001CZJP0S", "B002NUULNG", "B0049TC8C6", "B000CEV3O6", "078886145X", "B000A2LV4W", "B009AVCAJ4", "B007V9ECV6", "B004DMIISM", "B008YRL7JE", "1421550644", "1421561042", "B008D1RCKY", "B00B1RB9AQ", "B00AQ7DWCK", "B000VWYJ5Y", "B00B6DTFOC", "B00G5SBI1Q", "B009RZ890M", "B000058A7J", "B00CU6WC94", "B004DMIIPA", "B0043988G2", "B000YAA68W", "B005W2BWEO", "B008D1RDIU", "B002Y0KR66", "B008NNY9YE", "B008XEZXXE", "B00BQ1DDUG", "B00CU6WBOU", "B002KPIO4C", "B00BLQRFQY", "B00GS1GWRU", "B000B8I9XQ", "B00576U9JE", "B00CU6WC8K", "B007DCE5UO", "B000F6ZIFQ", "B000IZGBW8", "B0035RWG0M"], "bought_together": ["B00005JLEU", "B000CDGVOE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002ZTQV8Y", "B00005JLEU", "B00ENNO1E6", "B002ZTQVGQ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 937}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 13.99, "brand": "Buena Vista", "asin": "B00003CXBK", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51KXTH5HPHL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Princess Mononoke"}

{"description": "Autumn in New Yorkis a by-the-numbers love story, right down to its opening shot of, yes, autumn in New York. Richard Gere stars as restaurateur/lady's man Will, while Winona Ryder plays the airy-fairy, oh-too-delicate-for-this-world Charlotte. Will is 48, Charlotte is 22, and it just keeps getting creepier: Will actually used to hang out with Charlotte's mom. She plays artily with beads and sparkly things, he notices how elfin anddifferentshe is (inspiring such stomach-churning dialogue as \"I find you completely unprecedented and therefore utterly unpredictable\"), and soon they're in love. Ah, but it's doomed: she has a tumor in her heart (just in case you missed the significance, Charlotte says \"I'msickin myheart!\"). Does Charlotte have enough time left to teach Will to truly love? While Gere does a stoic job, Ryder spends a lot of time being darling and winsome, aided by the fact that Charlotte has managed to catch one of those special movie diseases where you never look bad or get tubes stuck up your nose. Director Joan Chen doesn't have much of a script to work with, but at least she knows how to pick a cinematographer; the whole movie is shot in gorgeous fall-leaf colors. Several excellent supporting actors are trapped in this movie: Jill Hennessey and Anthony LaPaglia do their very best, but what can they do in the face of such a sweeping, creepy love?Autumn in New Yorkis nothing if not an earnest movie, and it certainly means well. Much like Charlotte, it seems to cry, \"Can you let me love you? Please?\" No.--Ali Davis", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 457288}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.88, "brand": "", "asin": "B00003CXL6", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41TX5RDFCQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Autumn in New York [VHS]"}
{"description": "Road Tripis a mostly agreeable, by-the-numbers teen flick with a  handful of inspired sequences, most of them involving MTV's resident disturbed  soul, Tom Green. It concerns a sleepy University of Ithaca student named Josh  (Breckin Meyer) who accidentally mails a video of his sexual encounter with an  infatuation (Amy Smart) to his longtime girlfriend (Rachel Blanchard), who's  seemingly avoiding him while at school in Austin, Texas. Naturally, he recruits  some buddies--Seann William Scott as the lech, D.J. Qualls as the hopeless nerd,  and Paulo Costanzo as the doper genius--to hit the open highway and intercept  the package. Even more naturally, mayhem ensues: A car explodes, a bus is  stolen, a nerd is deflowered, French toast is horribly violated, and an elderly  man bogarts both pot and Viagra.The film's humor is more democratic than politically correct, as everyone--women  and minority characters, not just the hipster white guys--have a hand in the  high jinks. Green plays Barry Manilow (no, not that one), a professional student  (eight years and counting)--he relates the film's story to skeptical prospective  students while leading them on a tour of the college--and thrill-seeking dork  extraordinaire. In particular, in an already justly famous sequence of scenes,  he sadistically anticipates and endeavors to accelerate a mouse's demise at the  jaws of a python. It's very much in the vein ofAmerican Pie, perhaps a  smidgen tamer, but at least its characters don't really learn any dopey lessons  in the end. Director and coscreenwriter Todd Phillips, who earlier made the  much-questioned documentaryFrat House, again proves he's more adept at  staging fictional comic sequences than real ones.--David Kronke", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEFXVW0", "B00AEFYS2M", "B0023TCWE8", "B000069CF0", "B0009ZE9VW", "B00005JMX6", "B00003CXS7", "B000069HQ2", "B000JJ4DNW", "B0009P42WI", "B000IZJZIU", "B003TY2SPO", "B000EMGJAO", "B000BKVQS4", "B001OD4S50", "B00AEFZ3XU", "B002CLKV54", "B00005NTOH", "B005LAIH9A", "B000031WD9", "B002Q4VBPQ", "B000CPH9PM", "B00003CY6D", "B00024JC4E", "B00260HH1W", "B006WXHJLC", "B004SIP8ES", "B00005KA6V", "B0006GANPA", "B000LC3ICE", "B00IMYVCGW", "B003VPX5Y4", "B00AEFYSL8", "B00005JMCT", "B001G5T6GW", "B00003CXE4", "B001J9KJ4I", "B0009HBPN0", "B000WZEZGI", "B00068WOH8", "B00AEBBA2C", "B00005JKMN", "B00000F0AD", "0800141687", "B001L9EXTS", "B00AEFYAMA", "B0026BXHQ0", "B004I9SJH0", "B002FU8IWU", "B0051MKNRC", "B008220BGQ", "B001C0JCBA", "B000BKJ762", "B0000A02TZ", "B004EPYZS0", "B00007AJGM", "B000E6EHE0", "630529142X", "B000RJO56O", "B001DPHDB0", "B00005JL93", "B008R65XUQ", "B0002V7TMY", "B004LWZW5G", "B000BKJ758", "6305310254", "B00005JNZU", "B004EPZ06G", "B004EPZ084", "B0041KKYGU", "0783235070", "B000ELJAEM", "B000FP2OPO", "B00003CXO1", "B004SIP9CO", "B00441GZ1E", "B00003CXPS", "B000FS9UKI", "B000F9RLL2", "B002AS466O", "B00005JMDZ", "6305428549", "B00003CY5A", "6305433925", "B0001XAQ9Q", "B000063RQO", "B00049QJBG", "B003Y5H5B0", "B00081912E", "B002ZG99H2", "B00BTYNXJG", "B0006HBZE2", "B00441GYVA", "B00005JLQE", "B00AEFY0XE", "B00KNALRZ4", "0790730979", "B008R65XNS", "B008JFUORW", "B001KKU9DW"], "bought_together": ["B00AEFXVW0", "B000JJ4DNW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AEFXVW0", "B00AEFYS2M", "B000CPH9PM", "B004GTVU6O"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 59003}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.69, "brand": "Dreamworks Skg", "asin": "B00003CXIY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5142ge7XncL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Road Trip (Unrated Edition)"}

{"description": "If you want to laugh and enjoy yourself, I recommend Bring It On. With a superb cast, catchy lines, and a fully developed plot, this movie is great! Kirsten Dunst stars as Torrance Shipman, the ditzy but loveable high school senior who is newly elected team captain of her high school cheerleading team. But when a replacement cheerleader, Missy Pantone, walks in to the Toros' cheerleading squad (hilariously portrayed by Eliza Dushku), she shows Torrance that the team's cheers are ripped off from the East Compton Clovers, and you can believe that the Clovers are fed up with the stealing. Torrance, horrified that her cheerleading career has been a fake, makes an effort to be original, but the result is a humiliating performance at a competition. Torrance is comforted by love interest Cliff Pantone (played by hottie Jesse Bradford), Missy's REALLY cute twin brother, and a romance begins. As the movie leads up to the UCA Nationals competition, the Clovers and Toros fight for the win. Who will it be? Well you better watch it for yourself. Bring It On is a refreshing change from the immature sick sex movies and it instead is fresh, bright, witty, and very funny.

The titillating passages whip all of France into a sexual frenzy, until a fiercely conservative doctor (Caine) tries to put an end to the fun, inadvertently stoking the excitement to a fever pitch.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000F7CECK", "B004SIP86Q", "B006GL8NQ0", "B0073U2EWM", "B000N3SU92", "B001PPLJIQ", "B0010DM3R4", "B001RJ1Y62", "B000QUCNOK", "B0007R4SX6", "B00006FD9P", "B00004Y7JN", "B0001US61O", "B00116GEJ8", "B00005R87R", "B0016Q2D66", "B004P7CMVE", "0870679406", "1604594187", "0780619587", "0783230559", "B004YCKJNI", "6304696515", "B000ZOXDFA", "B000053VB3", "B00006L91I", "0802130852", "B00H9HZITU", "B00JVQ7PWU", "B0030BOCMS", "B000K2UGXO", "B00E8G5GU6", "B00003CXKS", "B0007PALGG", "B001L57ZZG", "B00005JMIJ", "B00005KHJJ", "B00005JMU1", "B00005JMJG", "B00005BCK9", "B0001DMVBC", "B0010KP360", "B003Y5H59C", "B001AIQ14A", "B004YCKKFK", "B000ETRCMQ", "B00008RV1F", "6305132917", "B006QVRVJK", "B0041KKYEM", "B00I567EWS", "B000BBOUUE", "B00009W0U4", "B00005B6L0", "B009B1EPQ4", "B0064MT1FI", "B0009X75J2", "B00000G02H", "B000CSUNQQ", "B002T4GY4Q", "B00006JDU8", "B00005BKZN", "0767817729", "B0000VD04M", "B000067IZ3", "B006ISJQ1W", "B00004W4UB", "1492334502", "B000EDWKXI", "B002ZG980U", "B00007AJFB", "B005GRF37M", "B000NIVJFY", "B0045O2PHS", "B0000029GF", "B000BZISVM", "B003M987PQ", "B00366F2NU", "B008NNY8RC", "6304712936", "B001P3SA8K", "B00079HZUM", "B000ERVJQ8", "B000NOIX48", "B00003CXWG", "B00005ATQB", "B0051HCVEU", "0783227329", "B001PPLJJ0", "B004SIP7S0", "B000092T3P", "B000E33VWW", "B000M06KJ8", "B00003CXKM", "B000ETRCN0", "B005S9EJ8W", "B0000639HN", "B0037QGS0A"], "bought_together": ["B000F7CECK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004SIP86Q", "B0073U2EWM", "0822215314", "B0057ZAA6W"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 23359}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 15.95, "brand": "RUSH", "asin": "B00003CXPV", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518FHJP6HML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Quills"}

{"description": "Julia Roberts outdoes herself in yet another David and Goliath struggle based on a true story. Erin Brockovich (Roberts) is a down-on-her-luck mother of three who can't seem to hold down a job. After having an auto accident, she makes a bumpy transition from client to employee at the law firm and stumbles onto a case with staggering implications. It seems that utility giant PG&E; has poisoned the groundwater and the local residents are getting gravely ill.\nThe story starts poorly with scenes of Erin looking for jobs and botching her accident case. The first twenty minutes of the film could have been condensed into five. However, once the investigation of the case begins, the story is engrossing. It is a powerful and well written human interest drama centered on a tough and smart (though crude) woman who leads a passionate crusade on behalf of the victims.\nDirector Steven Soderberg played it straight in filming this after his extremely avant-garde effort in \"The Limey\". His key strength here was the direction of the actors with both Julia Roberts and Albert Finney giving excellent interpretations of their characters. However, my only negative criticism of the film was the way Erin's boyfriend George was presented. George is a grubby tattoo covered biker (the tattoo on his left shoulder says \"DIRTY\") who behaves like Ward Cleaver with a ponytail. He is genteel, articulate, level headed, patient, sensitive and kind. All of this is so disconnected with his lifestyle that it seems inconceivable that a character this wonderful could possibly come in this package.\nJulia Roberts' gave a superlative performance that smashed any myth about her inability as a dramatic actor.", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783241569", "6301796535", "6303269834", "B008JFUNKU", "0790748169", "6303637574", "B0001E7LQG", "6304259131", "B00329TVQA", "0792116887", "6302936381", "6305426694", "6301734734", "0783222955", "B004IFIMT4", "6305368139", "B000007OY0", "0790751089", "B00007E2F6", "6300214222", "6302935148", "6302820448", "0800125762", "B000053VDQ", "B00005LQ1P", "B00004RT4K", "630394518X", "0782006779", "B0000040EO", "080018789X", "6302779278", "0792841859", "630266232X", "6303696813", "6304178352", "0793927501", "6301798503", "630233683X", "6300269043", "6301670159", "6302797667"], "bought_together": ["6301796535"], "also_viewed": ["6302158095", "6303637574"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 100360}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.58, "brand": "", "asin": "B00003CXFU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51D1C8BJXAL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Erin Brockovich [VHS]"}

{"description": "Ronald, the klutzy high-school brain played by Buster Keaton inCollege, is an inspired variation on the insulated millionaire playboys of earlier films. This bookish mama's boy who couldn't throw a fit, let alone a football, vows to become a college athlete to win the heart of the campus sweetheart. Of course in this path lies disaster, and his follies in track and field (the flyweight tries to throw the hammer and winds up flinging himself) only increase when he's made coxswain of the rowing team. Keaton's mix of energetic earnestness and flailing incompetence make his athletic tryout the film highlight, but in classic Keaton fashion Mr. Two Left Feet becomes the world's greatest athlete to save his sweetie from a bullying muscle-bound brute, mastering every event he so hilariously botched earlier in a decathlon dash to the rescue. This episodic comedy is more like his early shorts than his best features, lacking the narrative backbone that supports such masterpieces asThe GeneralandSteamboat Bill, Jr., but it's full of inspired physical comedy and Keaton's unique brand of gymnastic genius. Also featured are three short films:The Haunted House, with bank teller Buster matching wits against robbers in a gadget-filled hideout; the recently rediscoveredHard Luck, which recounts Buster's unsuccessful efforts to end it all (the missing conclusion is reconstructed from stills); andThe Blacksmith, where Buster disastrously attempts to apply assembly line efficiency to a village smithy.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305701245", "B000021Y7N", "6305609942", "B001E18222", "B003H221MI", "B0041CGOZ8", "B0000214GC", "B005SDB8H8", "B0006Z2KXO", "B008BWFOXC", "0810942275", "B00004Z4W3", "B0002CHIFG", "B0056HTEKO", "B000021Y7O", "0520256670", "B0002HOEJY", "6305131139", "B0085A9K3K"], "bought_together": ["6305609942"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AOCDE7U"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 372479}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 13.96, "brand": "Kino International", "asin": "B00003ETHH", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21V6K9PTZFL.jpg", "title": "College"}
{"description": "In the first season ofThe X-Files, creator Chris Carter was uncertain of the series' future, so each of the episodes is a self-contained suspense story; they do not delve deep into the ongoing X-Files mythology or turn to self-parody and humor as do episodes in later seasons. Yet, these episodes display the elements for which the show would become famous: the cinematic production values and top-notch special effects, the stark lighting of the Vancouver sets, the atmospheric halo of Mark Snow's score, and the clever plots dealing with subjects ranging from the occult, religion, and monsters to urban legends, conspiracy theories, and science fiction. Most importantly, season&nbsp;1 introduces FBI agents Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and Fox \"Spooky\" Mulder (David Duchovny), two of the most attractive government officials around. Scully is the serious-minded medical scientist assigned to join Mulder on the X-Files, a division of the FBI dealing with the paranormal. Mulder is the intuitive thinker with a dry wit, a passionate believer in the existence of paranormal phenomena and one of the few characters on television smart enough to figure out who the bad guy is before the audience does. Their muddled relationship, a deep friendship laced with sexual tension, provides the human heart in a world where the bizarre and horrible lurk in everyday society.The materials on the bonus disc provide some interesting trivia and background, but it is the 24 episodes themselves that make this seven-disc boxed set a true find. Those unfamiliar withThe X-Filesoften view all the fuss with the same skepticism with which Scully first regards her new partner's ideas.

Based on interviews with more than 500 people about the one memory they would choose to take with them to heaven, Japanese director Hirokazu Kore-Eda has modeled a unique blend of documentary and fiction that addresses the vagaries of memory but also what it means to make films.After Lifetranspires in a sort of way station where the dead must select one memory to be re-created on film and taken on with them forever, relinquishing everything else. Over the span of a week, a dedicated group of caseworkers tease out self-deceptions as well as real epiphanies from 22 different lives. An old woman remembers reuniting with her husband on a crowded bridge after World War II; a man recollects the breeze felt on a tram ride the day before summer vacation; a successful man faces his own treachery.

{"description": "The trial of Nazi war criminals following the Allied victory in Europe in World War II is dramatized in this uneven TV movie starring Alec Baldwin as Robert Jackson, a U.S. Supreme Court justice who served as the chief prosecutor for the Allies. The gravity of the controversial concept of having a war crimes trial, and the political maneuvering between Britain, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union that made it possible, is explained fairly well in the early portions of the film, even if Baldwin at times delivers lines that seem to have been lifted from a high school history textbook. Scenes of Nazi officers being rounded up and jailed are evocative, as are scenes of a ruined Germany. But a subplot involving Baldwin's character having an extramarital affair with his secretary,  played by Jill Hennessy, seems utterly extraneous. Perhaps the intent was to show that even someone taking a moral stand on a global stage can be flawed, but Baldwin's Supreme Court justice faces no consequences from his infidelity. Baldwin dominates the courtroom scenes as the outraged prosecutor, while Hennessy has little to do beyond looking great in her 1940s wardrobe. And as the film progresses the brilliant performance of Brian Cox as Hermann Goering simply seizes all attention, as Hitler's deputy is uncannily portrayed as a brilliant manipulator to the very end.Nurembergis consistently interesting, and to its credit it does contain much serious material on the Nazi war crimes, but it is in the end a flawed production.--Robert J.

{"description": "Mostly for Poirot completists and admirers of then-trendy, all-star ensemble casts from the 1970s and early '80s,Evil Under the Sunfinds Peter Ustinov in his second outing as Agatha Christie's famous Belgian detective (three years after 1978'sDeath on the Nile). As the title promises, the action this time takes place on an Adriatic island (though Christie fans will surely balk at the switch from the novel's setting on the English coast), where a famous stage star (Diana Rigg) is murdered, and the list of likely suspects is unusually high. The parade of legendary performers--Roddy McDowall, James Mason, Sylvia Miles, Maggie Smith, Jane Birkin--plus Ustinov's energetic performance keep things hopping. But Anthony Shaffer's lazy screenplay and director Guy Hamilton's superficial approach nudge everything (action, characters, tone) toward campy, near-parody, with bitchy sniping, tacky costumes, and an obligatory soundtrack of Cole Porter tunes. It's only in the last lap that the film transcends such obviousness and finds its way back to the glories of detective fiction.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001KP2J3U", "B00AEFYO5I", "B001KP2J3K", "B000GB5M1A", "B00005QBZL", "B00005RDRO", "B002Q3MYA8", "B000GB5M1K", "B000068QOB", "B000GB5M1U", "B000CSTK38", "B00000JGHT", "B00AEFXNXW", "B000199JJI", "B0090XLDO0", "B000068UE9", "B004HHX9H8", "B00A0HT99G", "B003L80FLC", "B00005Q4D6", "0790741318", "B00005KH4B", "B00000I0DA", "B00008K772", "B0028AENVC", "B004HJ0ZLE", "B005X5XINI", "B000059LGD", "B00347AIRQ", "B008RNYMPG", "B00GWXHYPI", "B00GWXI0S8", "B00GAXASKS", "B001KP2J44", "B007CBWXD2", "B00D7AM2V0", "B000CRR36K", "B002HR456E", "B007ISJS0U", "B008N8A3O4", "B002MUAXJY", "630560097X", "B00GAXASLC", "B000CRR3EC", "B0008ENICU", "B00ICWO1LC", "B00KIZY3XW", "B00AEBB97S", "B00871C09S", "B000OHBCI8", "B002XDR5NC", "B000CC1TNI", "B00AEFY8ZE", "B0019K4YRU", "B00598OA7W", "B00DW5IKWK", "B000199JJS", "B00GHH9I62", "B00005RIX1", "B00EF0NYVI", "B00CBVWWLQ", "B00A27O5AW", "B0083HXKM2", "B00BDSRM4K", "B004Z74X0M", "B008N8A3DA", "B000GAKFIG", "B000G67M4U", "B0007Y3XRG", "B00347AIOE", "B008L0YN22", "B00598O9RI", "B005DVIPY4", "B005X5XI4C", "B00009ZPU3", "B00E8AVN9U", "B00GWXI16O", "B000IJ7AGK", "B004WMOSNM", "B0002HOEQ2", "0062073710", "B005H8G78O", "B006JY3O2M", "0783226853", "B00E44EZUE", "B003N2SUKY", "B000056HEA", "B001BGS17Q", "B00GWXI20E", "B005CFBZX4", "B00007G1WH", "B00GWXI2MC", "B00GWXI2RM", "B002TOL4EG", "B000ATQYWY", "B002GSXKQA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001KP2J44", "B001KP2J3U", "B00AEFYO5I", "B00005RDRO"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 247598}, "asin": "B000059LGF", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51W8TYE3MPL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Evil Under the Sun"}

{"description": "He's a semi-employed construction worker and she's a music teacher with ambitions for a singing career. But when they meet at her Brooklyn brownstone their socio-economic differences melt away--or do they? This is the question that drives this 112-minute HBO movie based on Terry McMillan's best-selling novel. Zora wears fabulous clothes, decorates her hardwood-floored apartment with unusual furniture, and dines with her girlfriends at chichi restaurants, while Franklin can't even make regular child-support payments to his estranged wife. She's college educated; he doesn't have his GED. Sanaa Lathan (Love and Basketball) gives Zora dignity and grace throughout the film, while Wesley Snipe's Franklin starts out with those qualities but eventually degenerates into sullenness. Director Gina Prince-Bythewood (Love and Basketball) starts out strong by making Brooklyn a third vibrant character and creating fun takes on the awkward events in every couple's early stages--meeting the friends, dining with the parents. But she loses her way a bit in the middle and seems to rush the end. With much of the transitional material of the book missing in the movie, female viewers may find the ending tough to swallow. The film is rated R for language, brief nudity (specifically of coproducer Snipes's rear quarters), and sexual content.--Kimberly Heinrichs", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00000JGHO", "B00005JLON", "B00004Y2R1", "B00BTYPWDQ", "B000XT1P52", "B001K98MGE", "B00066FAC6", "0783240201", "B002CA68NO", "6305505780", "B00066FAQW", "1558908390", "B00066FAVW", "0780627822", "6305428409", "B00005LB86", "B00GOZ2LPM", "B000F3UA5M", "B0000JBUHI", "B00FF9SKP8", "B00000JGHV", "B0041QSZS8", "B003UEYBPI", "B000BITV9W", "B00003W8NT", "B002CA68N4", "B00005B8UA", "B00007AJG1", "B0009S4IGA", "0767821955", "B000BOH8X2", "B00005JLG1", "B000LW7REE", "B00005RIX5", "B00AEFYE08", "B00013WWSO", "B00007L4KF", "B002CWKU36", "B000PE0GRI", "B00BEL4QFO", "0783230524", "B00007AJG2", "B00005JL72", "B000035P5I", "B000YAF4Q6", "B000JLTRH2", "B00H47IX5G", "B00007BK2S", "B000TLOMPE", "B00J11U57C", "B001DJLCQS", "B00003CY51", "B005LAIH86", "B000A2XAQ4", "B004SIP93S", "B002GSXKOM", "B00465I1CE", "B005LAIH1S", "B001132GNY", "B000HDZKLO", "B00ANDDBBY", "B00AEFXTKO", "6305120013", "B003BV8I3Q", "B000E5KUJW", "B00465I192", "B00005U156", "B000069I0E", "B00008977B", "B001P3SA94", "0767811070", "B0000YEE6M", "B003Y5H58S", "B002CAWNEM", "B00AMSM9AO", "B00005RDAO", "B00007K02J", "B004BZ5AFA", "B001DJLD12", "B000P0J0CE", "B000069DOB", "B000Y11B8K", "B0018RNF60", "B00GO4RGWQ", "B0000TWMTS", "B008PENF1O", "B00GR33LAK", "B00AEFYG3S", "B00007ELEO", "B000P0J092", "B000FS9ULC", "B00AMEZDJW", "0783237367", "0780627857", "B000E40QC4", "B002ZG99RW", "B0000TWMWK", "B00004WLTP", "B001QUF7DS", "B003HKN534"], "bought_together": ["B00000JGHO", "B00004Y2R1"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005JLON", "B00000JGHO", "B00BTYPWDQ", "B00004Y2R1"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 19189}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.97, "brand": "HBO Studios", "asin": "B00005ASOO", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41LWEX-QrXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Disappearing Acts"}

{"description": "The classic science fiction novel by H.G. Wells becomes this big-budget adventure directed by the author's great-grandson Simon Wells. Guy Pearce stars as Alexander Hartdegen, a scientist, professor, and inventor in 1895 New York City who believes that time travel is possible. The sudden and unexpected death of his fianc&#x82;e spurs Alexander to build a time machine, which he hopes to use in an effort to change the past. When he is unable to change the past, Alexander hurls himself more than 800,000 years into the future, seeking answers about the nature of time, but instead encountering a dystopian world where humanity has divided up into two races, the peaceful Eloi and the subterranean Morlocks. Befriending the beautiful Eloi woman Mara (pop singer Samantha Mumba), Alexander must set out to save her from the underground world of the Morlocks when she is captured by them. Along the way, he is aided by Vox (Orlando Jones), a bio-mechanical being from the 21st century. Ultimately, Alexander makes a shocking discovery about the true nature of the Eloi and Morlocks and decides that the only way to change the future is to alter the present. Due to exhaustion, director Wells was briefly replaced during the last few weeks of production by Gore Verbinski, director of The Mexican (2001). The Time Machine co-stars Jeremy Irons and Mark Addy.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0045HCJSA", "B001BGS17Q", "B000CZ0PNK", "B00LNBQ8SI", "B00LMCDHMS", "B00LNBQ8UG", "B00ANDFL3A", "B00IYJFB2G", "0780619951", "B0000639BZ", "B00003CXXP", "B00003CWU3", "630587493X", "B00K2CHVSK", "B00007JMD8", "B00005JNTI", "B00L4K3MLE", "B00005JKU0", "B00AEBB8VK", "B000FVQLKW", "B00K2CHWYI", "B00LCAD24S", "B00005JKFR", "B001SGEUYW", "0780622650", "B005FQ2H8W", "B0019ESNGY", "B002945DU2", "B00AEBB8QK", "B00020HAWE", "B00000G3PA", "B00009NHC0", "0790750201", "B000HEWEDK", "B001P9N94E", "B00IKM5N1G", "B00008G8M5", "B00005JL78", "B000O78KWE", "B0000844I8", "B0050MB5KM", "B00007G1YQ", "B008JFUO36", "B00D9EJFZA", "B0000AUHOH", "B00133KHBK", "B002UZCJ8Y", "B00IKM5LXG", "B000096IAC", "B00003CXKM", "B0016I0AJG", "B00008G8M4", "B000YDOOHI", "B00K7IPGS6", "B003NH3X5Q", "B008JFUNHI", "B00005N5S5", "0767812166", "B001EAWMGA", "B0045HCJ0S", "B002NZK5SM", "B00ECW9UJY", "B004B93RDS", "B001AR0D4A", "B00HWWUQYY", "B0009X75J2", "B000K7VHQ4", "B00004W46I", "B00009ATIX", "B000SFJ4K4", "B000HC2LZS", "B000KGGIV4", "B003BJO8KU", "B00AZMFJYA", "B00008438U", "B000QQJ3Q0", "B001BSBBNK", "6305090564", "B000BUNZY2", "B006VRRGNK", "079073639X", "B0074JOUHE", "B00AEBBA72", "B00J5LXMTG", "B000C20VNM", "B001A4VH3Y", "B00JL6L4UY", "B000063UR0", "B00079HZS4", "B00AEFXT7W", "B002BFBB4Q", "0783226063", "B000MX7V70", "0783231032", "B00005Y6XR", "B00BTYPW7C", "B00006JDRG", "0783240961", "1558908846", "B0013LL2Z2"], "bought_together": ["B0045HCJSA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0045HCJSA", "B001BGS17Q", "B00AIBZMD6", "B0090SI56Y"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 14168}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 15.26, "brand": "Dreamworks Skg", "asin": "B00005JKLZ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RZF2PBJAL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Time Machine"}

{"description": "WithThe Return of the King, the greatest fantasy epic in film history draws to a grand and glorious conclusion. Director Peter Jackson's awe-inspiring adaptation of the Tolkien classicThe Lord of the Ringscould never fully satisfy those who remain exclusively loyal to Tolkien's expansive literature, but as a showcase for physical and technical craftsmanship it is unsurpassed in pure scale and ambition, setting milestone after cinematic milestone as the brave yet charmingly innocent Hobbit Frodo (Elijah Wood) continues his mission to Mordor, where he is destined to destroy the soul-corrupting One Ring of Power in the molten lava of Mount Doom. While the heir to the kingdom of Men, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), endures the massive battle at Minas Tirith with the allegiance of the elf Legolas (Orlando Bloom), dwarf Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) and the great wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen), Frodo and stalwart companion Samwise Gamgee (Sean Astin) must survive the schizoid deceptions of Gollum, who remains utterly convincing as a hybrid of performance (by Andy Serkis) and subtly nuanced computer animation.Jackson and cowriters Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens have much ground to cover; that they do so with intense pacing and epic sweep is impressive enough, but by investing greater depth and consequence in the actions of fellow Hobbits Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd), they ensure thatReturn of the Kingmaintains the trilogy's emphasis on intimate fellowship. While several major characters appear only briefly, and one (Christopher Lee's evil wizard, Saruman) relegated entirely to the extended version on DVD, Jackson is to be commended for his editorial acumen; like Legolas the archer, his aim as a filmmaker is consistently true, and he remains faithful to Tolkien's overall vision. IfReturnsuffers from too many endings, as some critic suggested, it's only because the epic's conclusion is so loyally inclusive of the actors--most notably Astin--who gave it such strength to begin with. By ending theLOTRtrilogy with noble integrity and faith in the power of imaginative storytelling,The Return of the King, like its predecessors, will stand as an adventure for the ages.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JKZV", "B00003CWT6", "B00BEZTMFY", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B002ZG980U", "B002PMV9FG", "B008UZA8FY", "B001NGML48", "B00005JM5E", "B001GZ6QC4", "B005COPWZW", "B008M4C1EO", "B00HFFE8HE", "039548930X", "B000W7F5SS", "B000I0RQVI", "B002VWNIDG", "B000E6EK2Y", "B001BYMX4A", "B004M1A21K", "B007K3JFUQ", "B001DHXT20", "B001UV4XHY", "0345325818", "B003Y5H54W", "B00005JNJV", "B00E5I2M6I", "B000A3XY5A", "B004LWZWGA", "B000U7WV1Y", "B005LXQLRW", "B001OQCV6A", "B000E8M0VA", "B004SIP8ZM", "B000EHRVMY", "0618640150", "B003ZK99NQ", "B0013FDM7E", "B00005JPH2", "B000UNYK4E", "B009JBWOU0", "B00003CX5P", "B00008G8M5", "B00GKOJ98E", "B004LWZW42", "B000H30B2C", "B000P0J0C4", "B00CZDLGDU", "B000M341QE", "B00008G8M4", "B000FKO5QK", "B00HWWUQYY", "B007SPPANM", "B008JFUO72", "B001DJLD1M", "0345538374", "B00AEFY5B6", "B00005JKCH", "B004SIP9U6", "B000YGGNMO", "B00E5I2M9K", "0618126988", "B005OCFGTO", "B00E8S2JZ4", "6305313687", "B004AKCME8", "B0002KVUKM", "B000AARKOO", "B0006GAO5Y", "B000K7VHQ4", "B002ZG997C", "B00AHTYI5M", "B008JFUS0U", "B0042MEQVG", "B00275EGWY", "B00E9PMML2", "B008UZDXEW", "B004SIP7F8", "B00116GEJS", "B00003CXI1", "B003ZKBELG", "B003Y5H5EW", "B000V4UFZK", "B0007PLLBU", "B001DTPZNY", "B002O3Z50Q", "B001GCUO1Q", "B000LP6KNU", "B005G4TJUC", "B00AW0KHTM", "B002ZG97YM", "054792819X", "B00AEFXZJE", "B0000YEEGM", "B002IPFWTE", "B001ECQ75A", "B000065U1N", "B0051MKNV8", "B000W796OM", "B00J49R1BY"], "bought_together": ["B00005JKZV", "B00003CWT6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00HFFE8HE", "B00003CWT6", "B00005JKZV", "B00BEZTMFY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 1589}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.49, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00005JKZY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HS7iSFv5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)"}

{"description": "The first disc starts with a 38-minute interview with Salma Hayek that, with her recollections of the film, works the same as a commentary track. Director Julie Taymor takes center stage for the rest of the 2-disc set. Besides an engaging commentary track, there are two interviews with the director, a Q&A; session after an AFI screening, and a better one with Bill Moyers. The second disc is set-up for short (5- to 7-minute) featurettes on the making of the film--production design, cinematography, locations, two visual effects pieces, and so on--but oddly not one with the Oscar-winning make-up crew. All of these segments are better produced and more interesting than most DVD supplements, however there is little biographical information on Frida (letting the movie speak for itself). The music element gets the most attention: an interview with vocalist and Frida's lover Chavela Vargas, Hayek interviewing composer Elliot Goldenthal, and Goldenthal's own commentary track explaining his Oscar-winning score.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0030T120A", "B00005KHJJ", "B000CCCZYA", "B00116GEJ8", "B004XVMCMG", "B0001US61O", "B003ODIV10", "B000BYA4HY", "B005TTEG3O", "0060085894", "B0011FLH14", "B0043CT8GI", "B00006LLNV", "B001CK7OLU", "B000AL72R8", "3822859834", "B0041I97CO", "B000N3T0DW", "B005CFBZ3O", "0060923199", "B003WKQ46E", "B00005JNCZ", "0517592355", "B000WZAE7W", "B0006GANX2", "B0051URXWM", "B000FIHN5M", "B0000A2ZU1", "B001ILTUKQ", "0448426773", "B0009K7RXY", "B0002TT0MI", "B00180IPM6", "3836512645", "B00005N8A9", "B0041KKYF6", "B000NO1XG8", "0810959542", "B000YKYT2G", "1451632835", "B00134PSV8", "B00EV1YZKK", "B000NVI0EY", "B002ZMZBIM", "B00005JLQW", "1452108250", "B00AZMFKXK", "0060166991", "B00005R87F", "B000AM4P90", "B004IF4EVY", "B000EZ9084", "B001CK7OM4", "B000T5O4AI", "B00GJNQ3S0", "0486413500", "0486413667", "B000O76ZQC", "B00008AOX5", "B004U7MR1Y", "B001DJ7PR8", "B00275EGNS", "B003VTKZ8O", "B00E5G03KM", "B000NOIX48", "B0002KPIQY", "0452286867", "B001FM7KRI", "B000063N9O", "B000YIGNCC", "B00005JMJD", "0811800393", "3822858625", "6304806418", "B0031REQKE", "B004CJQVQC", "B00049QJ9I", "0516264664", "B000063K0I", "B00008PHD1", "0780619587", "B001BWYT4E", "B000LV6OC6", "B0016LFG2Y", "B006HAJAGM", "B000K7VHNW", "B00005JH9M", "B000NTPG84", "B0016MJ6T2", "B001QUF3SW", "B00BLYCB1K", "B0019K4YT8", "B0064MT1FI", "B00GPPXNIK", "B003BR8MDQ", "B000AARKOO", "B0015ET3YO", "1573440299", "B000092T3B"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000CCCZYA", "B00005KHJJ", "0060085894", "B004XVMCMG"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 123302}, "asin": "B00005JLPK", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51F4umWFdiL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Frida"}
{"description": "An enormously entertaining (if somewhat shallow) affair from blockbuster   director Steven Spielberg. Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Frank Abagnale,  Jr., a  dazzling young con man who spent four years impersonating an  airline pilot, a  doctor, and a lawyer--all before he turned 21. All the  while he's pursued by a  dedicated FBI agent named Carl Hanratty (Tom  Hanks), whose dogged determination  stays one step behind Abagnale's  spontaneous wits. Both DiCaprio and Hanks turn  in enjoyable  performances and the movie has a bouncy rhythm that keeps it  zipping  along. However, it never gets under the surface of Frank's drive to lose   himself in other identities, other than a simplistic desire to please  his father  (Christopher Walken, excellent as always), nor does it  explore the complex  mechanics of fraud with any depth. By the movie's  end, it feels like one of  Frank's pilot uniforms--appearance without  substance.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00080ZG10", "B006OFN0SE", "B000M341QE", "B00AEBB8NI", "B001EZE5DI", "B004SIP7TE", "B000MZHW40", "0767905385", "B00005JMYC", "B002ZG980U", "B00049QQHI", "B0016Q2D66", "B00AEBB9F0", "B00003CWM3", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B000P0J0EW", "B00008DP4C", "B000PHVZNE", "B001N44BVQ", "B00005JOC9", "B004SIP7ZS", "B0007DFJ0G", "B007SPPANM", "B00H9KKGTO", "B002T9H2LA", "0800141806", "B000N6U0E2", "B000P0J0EM", "B00AEBB89W", "B000FVQLQQ", "B00001ZWUS", "B0050546MS", "B00DHHWXYY", "0783225733", "6304711891", "B00AEFY0F2", "B002VWNIEA", "B0051MKNV8", "B002ZG99N6", "B0077ATSSQ", "B00011CZRE", "B0013XZ2QK", "B00275EGWY", "B00005JKBC", "B00003CXWV", "B002O5M4T4", "B002FU8IWU", "B008MILL8W", "B004XQO90O", "B004SIP95G", "B000YAF4MA", "B005LAIIJY", "B00005JMJG", "B002QEHPQU", "0780631536", "B00DHDDE32", "B0031OCY2E", "0783240295", "B000P0J0BK", "B004FQX5B6", "B0034G4OUO", "B005HWAOP2", "6305313687", "B003UESJH4", "B000YABYLA", "B00005JKWX", "B00BEIYL6G", "B0058JEHSO", "B000A7DVR2", "B0002ZDVEU", "B00003CXZ1", "B00003CXQ4", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00005RYLX", "B001VPCINK", "B000FKO5QK", "B0045HCJRG", "B009POCG0Y", "B00AEBB9SM", "B002UZCJ8Y", "B002DU39GW", "6304806434", "B00JQYV0B4", "B00AEFXE9U", "B00004WG2F", "B000EXZFCQ", "B00005JMCN", "B00006RCNV", "B000K7VHQE", "B00441GYXS", "B00A24CAAW", "B0045HCJ8K", "B004SIP9Z6", "B002NZK5R8", "B000K7VHTQ", "B00AEFXXMI", "B00005JL78", "0783233477", "B000J3OTT6", "B000O77SRC"], "bought_together": ["B00080ZG10", "B000M341QE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004SIP7TE", "B002ZG980U", "B00AEBB8NI", "B00ALTQRPW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 7335}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.99, "brand": "Dreamworks Skg", "asin": "B00005JLSB", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51bPnAto--L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Catch Me If You Can (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition)"}

{"description": "It's not that the folks at Pixar are geniuses when it comes to DVDs... well, come to think of it, their fifth DVD set shows these folks are wizards. It's not just that the two discs are packed with watchable extras that hardly reiterate the same information; it's how they are handled--funny, inventive, with a light touch--unlike many PR-driven discs. A good place to start is the filmmakers' jolly commentary track, which branches off into 31 minutes of behind-the-scene stuff, deleted scenes, and curious anecdotes (they can also be watched separately). Pixar's first making-of documentary is a most concise and interesting 25-minute examination that also sheds light on how the company works. With a digital-to-digital transfer, the film looks great and is available in widescreen or reformatted to full screen. The \"Family Fun\" disc includes another Pixar made-for-the-DVD gem, the 7-minute \"Exploring the Reef\" with Jean-Michel Cousteau (Jacques's son) being upstaged by Dori and Marlin; it's a hoot and teaches a fact or two you will remember about reefs. Both discs feature lovely menus that can be turned into virtual aquariums for your TV (by removing the text) featuring the knockout colors of the film's settings. Watch long enough for some shenanigans from the film's characters and vocal talent.

{"description": "TheNemesisDVD is distinguished by excellent picture and thrilling sound, especially in the starship battle sequences.  The bonus features are much more generous than the offerings on previousStar Trektheatrical films other than the two-disc special editions.  There are four featurettes (46 minutes total) discussing the casting of Shinzon, development of the story line, shooting the action scenes, and the themes of family and change that run through the film.  Director Stuart Baird contributes a commentary track that is a bit dry and sometimes silent.  He mentions how he's not aTrekinsider and that because he was working in an established setting he didn't have the freedom of creation that directors usually do.  He also discusses the mechanics of shooting and points out where certain scenes were shortened or eliminated.  Seven of the cut scenes appear on the DVD, some introduced by Baird or Patrick Stewart.  They're interesting to see (and the alternate ending is pretty funny), but none was a great loss from the finished film.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00000ILBK", "6305181721", "B002I9Z8EO", "B0000UJL96", "B0000AUHOH", "B00DB97LRC", "B00005JKHP", "B002I9Z8BM", "B002I9Z8AS", "B00008GEK4", "B002HWRYJE", "B00AZMFJYA", "B002I9Z8I0", "B000F7CDY4", "B000CCBCIA", "B008JLETMM", "B001J4E1CY", "B000HC2PLS", "B001TH16CY", "B00151QY9Y", "B0000UJLVY", "B00005OAZZ", "B007WCJM1C", "B001M4YZ90", "B000BKDNX0", "B00JJ3EH6C", "B000063V8S", "B000FEBWTY", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B002XTXG1G", "B00005Y1NF", "B00BHWG0CM", "B001PUTN3Y", "B000063V8T", "0780622650", "B001TH16CE", "B00BHWG0DQ", "B0002VEWCE", "1415713812", "B001ASPO7K", "B001TH16D8", "B00005JNTU", "B00006HBUJ", "B0000844I8", "B000AYELVA", "B001EDVNNU", "B001DHXT3Y", "B000M53GN6", "B0009X7BDC", "B00000ILDF", "B000HCO83Q", "B001GCUO1Q", "B000RPCK1U", "B00HEPDGKA", "B008JFUO72", "B000063V8R", "B001DHXT6G", "B00003CX5P", "B001RHGRT8", "B00BEZTMFY", "B00C2CDJ34", "B00CTSDDVO", "B0017VG69U", "B004LWZW42", "B000AYELVU", "B000HEWEJ4", "B00005JLXH", "B005FNLUR4", "B000228EBS", "B000NIBURQ", "B000291Q52", "B005LAIGXW", "0783225520", "B0007X7044", "0767803434", "B00AEFYGBA", "B000M53GM2", "B0045HCJ9O", "B000NIBUR6", "B000VI70QS", "B00005JLF5", "B000NTMA0Q", "B00CAATSME", "B000MR9CXW", "B004LWZWGA", "B0001NBNFW", "B007REV4T8", "B000RPCK1A", "B000M53GMW", "B008SAPCTS", "B000ASDFEA", "B00005R2IS", "B000RPCK1K", "B00008G8M4", "B000OVLBHG", "B001DHXT20", "B00E5I2M6I", "B00000ILDH", "B001DTPZNY"], "bought_together": ["B00000ILBK", "B002I9Z8EO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002I9Z8GM", "B002I9Z8I0", "6305181721", "6305127638"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 136962}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.89, "brand": "Generic", "asin": "B00005JLRT", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/519EJJQ3GNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Star Trek - Nemesis (Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "Outstanding picture and sound plus tons of features makeCharlie's Angels: Full Throttlea fully loaded DVD.  Don't expect more T&A; in the unrated edition, however.  The only difference is glimpses of more intense violence in a few of the fight scenes.  For example, in the theatrical version you'll see an angel flying through the air, but in the unrated version you'll then see her lying expressionless on the ground.  Also, blood flies out of Drew Barrymore's mouth in one scene.  On his commentary track, director McG discusses inside jokes, visual effects, and shots that didn't quite work for him.  Like a TV sportscaster, he uses a telestrator, but only to occasionally circle items of interest or draw arrows.  There's also an amusing commentary track by the three writers, who chuckle over inside jokes and discuss how the film was changed from the original script.  They preface their comments with: \"I guess they asked us to do this just to prove that writers worked on this movie.\"  \"Who are we kidding?  Who's listening to this right now?\"If you want still more info, there's a trivia track with pop-up factoids with occasional links to more featurettes, a jukebox that offers clips of 11 songs and explanations of why they were picked, a cameo-graphy that offers clips of 13 personalities and why we should know them, and eight 4- to 18-minute featurettes exploring such topics as stunts, vehicles, costumes, and the Pussycat Dolls dance troupe.  And in the next evolution of product placement, the DVD-ROM \"Shop the Scene\" feature allows you to search for a character's outfit or gadget then buy it online.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002A5EBMQ", "B00164EAGY", "B00003CXZ1", "B00AEFYGBA", "B000069HYG", "B0000SX9N2", "B00005JL8Z", "B00004ZDO9", "B008H6GHII", "B000UDGOC0", "B007AFC0RY", "B0006L0LOS", "B000085EFK", "B0007P0Y7C", "B00003CXMP", "B00024JC4E", "B00016MSV2", "B0007PLLBU", "B001C5LLQ4", "B00005MEVO", "B000BKJ758", "B000MX7V70", "B000035Z3G", "B002GHHHL0", "B000LC3ICE", "B000FDFSH2", "B0006GANPA", "B000Y11BC6", "B000AP04FG", "B00026ZG10", "B0041KKYGU", "B00005JMUA", "0767819640", "B0018PH3KQ", "B00008G7UI", "B00BLN4V0A", "B002GOAH1A", "B00006HAWN", "B0001BS3IE", "B0009RCPUW", "B002ZG984Q", "B001EDVNNU", "B000VI70QS", "B004LWZW2O", "B000A343RI", "B0006FO8E8", "B000EGDB10", "B000RW3VCU", "B00005JN4H", "B00BTYMPUY", "B00005J761", "B000CEXGAU", "B005TK0MFE", "B0041ONFOE", "B000VG66XS", "B00ID8H98C", "B00007AJF5", "B00AEFXO8Q", "B0009W5JR8", "B008JFURII", "B00001PE4D", "B000M7FOO8", "B004P7CN7W", "B0000DZ6N3", "B00005JM5B", "B00007GZRP", "B000ARXF96", "B0018CNNV2", "B000CCW2P2", "B0009KA2OA", "B002O3Z4ZW", "B00006G8JD", "B0008FXT1Y", "B0000524E5", "B002GSXKOW", "B00005JM55", "B003Q6D2B4", "B005CFBYW6", "B00008WJD6", "B000ENC5YW", "B003FCKI3O", "B005Z9MFRC", "B00004STVN", "B00005JG6N", "B00E1HIXEI", "B0007OCG56", "B00005JMEW", "B000BTIU4S", "B00008WJEZ", "B000NIBURQ", "B000EQ5V8G", "B0001Z37HM", "B003PIUINS", "B00005JMW7", "B00196UTEG", "B000A2IPQY", "B004SIP6VI", "B00005JLZW", "B00005JNTU", "B00AEFXCLU"], "bought_together": ["B002A5EBMQ", "B00AEFYGBA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002A5EBMQ", "B0000CABE5", "B000069HYG", "B008JFUUIA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 26650}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.9, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B00005JLYW", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51L5TYVcBmL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle (Unrated Widescreen Edition)"}

Tess and Anna are trapped inside each other's body! But Tess's wedding is Saturday and the two must find a way to switch back -- fast!

For the estranged members of a contemporary family, the tangled relationships of their present are only complicated by their catastrophic past. And what begins as a search for clues becomes a determined quest for answers across a vast and ancient terrain of deception, denial, fact, and fears. This stunning and passionate motion picture explores the pursuit of identity through the intimate moments shared by lovers, families, enemies, and strangers.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0053IBQDO", "B000FIFHZ0", "B001NE4BE8", "B00HE011DE", "6305428107", "0780622251", "B0000D9PI7", "B00HE00ZIQ", "B003A83970", "B00HVOFP6W", "B000DZ8540", "B00E849QSG", "B007UI0CIA", "B00578K2H6", "B00004RF82", "6305291403", "B000059H95", "B0037QGS0K", "B002K2KMJK", "B00116VG3M", "B0006IIKRQ", "B005HT400A", "B00316DB7E", "B00AEFXW8I", "B002K2KMJA", "B00GPPXP6A", "B000CCD1VQ", "B00HE010QM", "B00008K77D", "B0043X1FM2", "B00006YXE5", "B0068FZ0GK", "B004IFYMYI", "B000BQ5IWI", "1616403969", "B00005TNF9", "B009WH0GZG"], "bought_together": ["B0053IBQDO", "B000FIFHZ0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0053IBQDO", "B00CYI4KCA", "B000FIFHZ0", "B00006YXE5"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 91176}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 19.99, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B00005JLR5", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51WP6TC8FAL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Ararat"}
{"description": "More sex. More violence. That's what you get in the unrated director's cut ofTaking Lives, which ought to tell you where director D.J. Caruso's priorities lie. The hot scenes between Angelina Jolie and Ethan Hawke are extended (offering a bit more nudity for Jolie's lecherous fans), and the fate of Gena Rowlands's character isconsiderablymore graphic, but none of the added footage makes the movie any better or worse. That said, this cynical director's cut is the only version worth buying if you're looking to fill out your serial-killer-thriller collection (or your movies-in-which-Jolie-gets-naked collection), and you might as well enjoy the gag reel outtakes because they contain the only footage on the entire DVD in which Jolie cracks a genuine smile. The four featurettes are really just one standard-issue promo reel chopped into thematic categories with a pretentiousCSIvibe, and while they offer little of substance, seasoned film buffs will welcome the appearance of veteran British editor Anne V. Coates, who briefly explains her approach to cutting high-tension scenes. The rest is routine at best, but given the choice between the full-screen DVD and this steamier, more gruesome widescreen version, well, it's no contest.

Without adding anything to the running time of the R-rated theatrical cut, the unrated edition substitutes steamier footage into the film Eli watches while talking to Matt, and removes some digitized bikinis in part of the strip-club scene.  (The new cut also has a more threatening scene between Matt and Kelly.)  Don't expect to see more of star Elisha Cuthbert, though; she didn't do any nude scenes, as she explains in one of the five scenes she provides commentary for.  Costar Emile Hirsch does his own commentary for three of the same scenes plus one other, but he's less insightful and more prone to gaps of silence than Cuthbert.

{"description": "There's a pretty good gimmick with these DVD extras aimed squarely at the pre-teen/early teen audience that ate up this film. Each of the extras (a standard making-of featurette, an alternate ending, and an interesting deleted scene) is followed by a clue afterwards. Decipher the clues and unlock the next set of extras: a nice bit on real treasure hunters, an awful piece on the Knights Templar, and one gem for kids: \"Riley Poole's Decode this!\" Actor Justin Bartha reprises his role (Nic Cage's techno-sidekick) and lectures a bit on the cooler side of language history and code-breaking with a few simple interactive games. If you get through it all, you unlock a hidden feature, a trivia track. Thankfully, those who do not want to go on the treasure hunt can access these features by reading the printed insert. Also thankfully, director Jon Turteltaub's enthusiasm always makes DVD extras more watchable than most.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0013BM63O", "B002GJTYIW", "B000NOKJC2", "B00979KQFO", "B00005JOC9", "B002O5M4T4", "B002ZG99KO", "B00005JM5E", "B00004Z4WR", "B001DTPZNY", "B005COPWZW", "B00008G8M4", "B000TGJ8CQ", "B000I0RQVI", "B001E75QH0", "B00AEFZ2DG", "B000OVLBF8", "B00003CXC5", "B0009NSCRQ", "B000ASATYY", "076780676X", "B00AEFYGBA", "B000U7WV1Y", "B00000G3PA", "B0067EKYAY", "0767810856", "B002O3Z50G", "B000YGGNMO", "B0012KJ0DK", "B000AYELVA", "B000JLTRIQ", "B000E8M0VA", "B001OQCV6A", "B000A0GP0Y", "B0009DWL8W", "B000VWYJ86", "B000IJ7A24", "B005LAII1W", "B001L57ZYM", "B0002ZDVEU", "B001TODCII", "B0049GYXH2", "B00000JQB5", "6305433909", "B000UNYK4E", "B0016Q2D5M", "B00177Y9ZC", "B001GCUO02", "B00003CXZ1", "B00014NEZI", "B007K3JFUQ", "B00003CXA6", "B0034GK78W", "B00344EAN2", "B001MVYUQG", "B000FO0AA6", "B004M1A21K", "B00003CXC3", "B0012QCZ54", "B00E8G5HQE", "B00E5I2MCM", "B00009XUM5", "B001DHXT20", "B00005JMXX", "B000J3OTT6", "B001FB55MG", "B000031EGV", "B001HQZJMU", "B0014Z4OMU", "B004SIP8JI", "B005LAIIPS", "B001F7MSFM", "B00005JMOW", "B001GZ6QC4", "B003Q6D2B4", "B00003CXMP", "B005F2JRUC", "B00AEFXSLE", "B004EPYZUS", "B000J3OTSM", "6305213283", "B00028HBES", "B000FO0A9W", "B008JFUNTG", "B0007KIFGE", "B002GSXKP6", "B001GCUO1Q", "B00008G8LM", "B00005JN3W", "B00AEFXXMI", "B0087ZG7NO", "B002ZG99TK", "B00AEFYXJ0"], "bought_together": ["B0013BM63O", "B002ZG99KO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0013BM63O", "B000NOKJC2", "B00BQRY4C6", "B002GJTYIW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 1940}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.75, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B00005JN5E", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51S18NKZHRL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "National Treasure (Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "Batman Beginsdiscards the previous four films in the series and recasts the Caped Crusader as a fearsome avenging angel. That's good news, because the series, which had gotten off to a rousing start under Tim Burton, had gradually dissolved into self-parody by 1997'sBatman & Robin. As the title implies,Batman Beginstells the story anew, when Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) flees Western civilization following the murder of his parents. He is taken in by a mysterious instructor named Ducard (Liam Neeson in another mentor role) and urged to become a ninja in the League of Shadows, but he instead returns to his native Gotham City resolved to end the mob rule that is strangling it. But are there forces even more sinister at hand?Cowritten by the team of David S. Goyer (a veteran comic book writer) and director Christopher Nolan (Memento),Batman Beginsis a welcome return to the grim and gritty version of the Dark Knight, owing a great debt to the graphic novels that preceded it. It doesn't have the razzle dazzle, or the mass appeal, ofSpider-Man 2(though the Batmobile is cool), and retelling the origin means it starts slowly, like most \"first\" superhero movies. But it's certainly the best Bat-film since Burton's original, and one of the best superhero movies of its time. Bale cuts a good figure as Batman, intense and dangerous but with some of the lightheartedness Michael Keaton brought to the character. Michael Caine provides much of the film's humor as the family butler, Alfred, and as the love interest, Katie Holmes (Dawson's Creek) is surprisingly believable in her first adult role. Also featuring Gary Oldman as the young police officer Jim Gordon, Morgan Freeman as a Q-like gadgets expert, and Cillian Murphy as the vile Jonathan Crane.--David HoriuchiBatmanat Amazon.comAllBatmanDVDsBatman Begins101: A Comic Book PrimerWhere Have I Seen Christian Bale?AllBatmanComics and Graphic NovelsBatmanToysBatman BeginsSoundtrackStills fromBatman Begins(click for larger images)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001GZ6QC4", "B004LWZWGA", "B002GSXKN8", "B000P0J06U", "B001OST0LW", "B000P0J06K", "B004EPZ07K", "B00E5I2MCM", "B00005JKCH", "B001GCUO1Q", "B002ZG980U", "B001OST0M6", "B008JFUPFI", "B004LWZWFQ", "B00005JMQW", "B004LWZW42", "B000VI70QS", "B001DHXT20", "B000M341QE", "B0000959N0", "B000UR9T8C", "B00005JNTU", "B000AYELVA", "B00E5I2M6I", "B002IPFWTE", "B000HEVZ9E", "B0090SI56Y", "B002HWRYJE", "B0006L0LOS", "B000OVLBF8", "B00003CWT6", "B000VR0570", "B00E5I2MEK", "B000HCO83Q", "B0007P0Y7C", "B008JFUO72", "B00F4FFO8E", "B001CDR1FG", "B000P0J0EW", "B002T9H2LA", "B0002KVUKM", "B00E5I2M9K", "B00005N5S5", "B0083SBMBM", "B0001BKAEY", "B00AQSN7HE", "B000J10EQU", "B00005JKZY", "B002NXSRVG", "B000AYELVU", "B001OQCV6A", "B004LWZW4M", "B001VLBDD0", "B001GZ6QEC", "B004GJYRA0", "B007REV4T8", "B001TK80C0", "B000HRJLII", "B001QTXM5Y", "B005G4TJUC", "B00005JKZV", "B0053FANT0", "B00005JA8B", "B003YAR97K", "B004SIP9Z6", "B00001ZWUS", "B004EPYZQC", "B001N44BVQ", "B006VRRGNK", "B001AEF6HM", "B00000JQB5", "B00011CZRE", "B00AZMFJYA", "B00AEFY0F2", "B007K3JFUQ", "B0002IQMAM", "B00005JN0T", "B002SJIO4A", "B000VWYJ86", "B0013FDM7E", "B00005JNTI", "B00407PNY2", "B00DTPRZ24", "B008JFUS0U", "B00004Z4WR", "B000FS9FCG", "B000QXDED6", "B0085A9HU6", "0780624890", "B00005LOUK", "B000065U1N", "B000P0J0AG", "B00005JN5T", "B001QB9H1U", "B00005JMUA", "0792844890", "B0007DFJ0G", "B004EPYZSK", "B008JFUOWM", "B00AEFY5B6"], "bought_together": ["B001GZ6QC4", "B004LWZWGA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B009JBWOU0", "B001GZ6QC4", "B004LWZWGA", "B002ZG980U"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 7806}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.99, "brand": "DC Comics", "asin": "B00005JNJV", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518zjc4XtzL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Batman Begins (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "Literary adaptations just don't get any better than director Joe Wright's 2005 version of Jane Austen'sPride & Prejudice. The key word here isadaptation, because Wright and gifted screenwriter Deborah Moggach have taken liberties with Austen's classic novel that purists may find objectionable, but in this exquisite film their artistic decisions are entirely justified and exceptionally well executed. It's a more rural England that we see here, circa 1790 (as opposed to Austen's early 19th century), in which Elizabeth Bennet (Keira Knightley) is one of several sisters primed for marriage, with an anxious mother (Brenda Blethyn) only too desperate to see her daughters paired off with the finest, richest husbands available. Elizabeth is strong-willed and opinionated, but her head (not to mention her pride and prejudice) lead her heart astray when she meets the wealthy Mr. Darcy (Matthew Macfadyen), whose own sense of decency and discretion (not to mentionhispride and prejudice) prevent him from expressing his mutual affection. They're clearly meant for each other, and as Knightley's performance lights up the screen (still young enough to be girlishly impertinent, yet wise beyond her 20 years), Austen's timeless romance yields yet another timeless adaptation, easily on par with the belovedBBC miniseriesthat has been embraced by millions since originally broadcast in 1995. Individual tastes will vary as to which version should be considered \"definitive,\" but with a stellar supporting cast including Judi Dench and Donald Sutherland, this impeccable production achieves its own kind of perfection.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_viewed": ["0800141660", "B00003JRCQ", "B00G6HO368", "B004SIP7AS", "B004P7CNZO", "B0053Q9DHW", "B000244FDW", "B000GRUQKQ", "B000244FFU", "B0018YCF50", "B001L57ZZG", "B004XVMCMQ", "B00AF82WTO", "B008D1RCHC", "B000Z27HLS", "B000BEZQ0Y", "0767851013", "0486284735", "B0002ZH5PQ", "B0012Q3T6I", "6303921248", "B002XTBE6K", "B001PJRAUS", "B00HYMBAQ0", "B0080QOL1A", "B00062IZ0Y", "B001C4AFOY", "B0012XIGVE", "B002KHNFFS", "B000244FF0", "B0012OVCE6", "B00HYMASS6", "B0009UZGAA", "B000784WMW", "0767020308", "B000LPQ6DE", "B001TJYFRU", "B000FTCEYQ", "B000ZS8GW6", "B005GRF2UK", "B004FM2EL2", "B00G7QPXAI", "149440477X", "B009ERK0SW", "B00006ZXSK", "B0000AUHPK", "B004UOHNCA", "0767020294", "B00094AS9U", "B000Z27HMW", "B002DY9KR0", "B000N4SHOE", "B000683VI4", "193799418X"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00G6HO368", "0800141660", "B00003JRCQ", "B005S9EK5Y"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "asin": "B00005JOHI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZGC68T2JL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Pride &amp; Prejudice"}

{"description": "The lurid scenario--a nymphomaniacal white trash nymphet (Christina Ricci) is held prisoner by a bitter bluesman (Samuel L. Jackson)--gives way to an affecting tale of redemption inBlack Snake Moan, writer/director Craig Brewer's follow-up to the acclaimedHustle & Flow. Lazarus (Jackson,Jungle Fever,Pulp Fiction) finds Rae (Ricci,Monster,The Ice Storm) beaten unconscious on the road in front of his backwoods house. After bringing her inside, he learns of her wanton ways and decides to exorcise his own demons by curing Rae of her sexual compulsion.Black Snake Moancould have been terrible, but Brewer takes his story seriously enough to dig into the genuine emotions of such a situation (though along the way he certainly flirts with sexploitation overtones--several scenes look like they were plucked straight out of a hitherto unknown 1970s trash classic). Ricci, Jackson, and the supporting cast (including pop star Justin Timberlake, giving a surprisingly good performance as Rae's boyfriend) treat the characters with respect, honesty, and humor. The result is off-kilter and maybe a little too fond of its sleazy cinematic forbears to truly hit the emotional notes it's after, butBlack Snake Moanhas considerably more substance than its marketing would suggest.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B003IY498Y", "B00AEFYAC0", "B0029Z8K74", "B000NO39FG", "B0050ODZ6M", "B000L211NC", "B004P7CN3G", "B000HC2M0C", "B001URA5Y8", "B000Q6GUSO", "B00006SFJJ", "B0037QGS0A", "0767821009", "B008B9JTLI", "B002PB4I50", "B003HTSJAY", "B00DHDDE1Y", "B00008Z463", "B00005R87R", "B00005JMON", "B0004Z3242", "B000092T3X", "B00AEBB89W", "B007ZC31R0", "B00008972P", "B00005JLD1", "B000JBXHQY", "B003VA3JZY", "B00005JH9M", "B000MZHW40", "B000JMK6OE", "B0041KKZGY", "B0002A2WDQ", "B0006210ZG", "B0017M9ZNI", "6305127654", "0780618548", "B0033PSH68", "B001JNNDJM", "B00AEBBA72", "B000OCZ9WS", "B000KX0IM2", "0790776960", "B000OYC7BW", "B00004ZETA", "B002NZK5VO", "B0002KPIQY", "B00005JKJA", "B0007V6ITE", "B000FAOC2W", "B00112S8RS", "B0020LH8WU", "B000RGX0EK", "B002DKGWSE", "6305065551", "B002AT8K9W", "B00005JP4N", "0780625528"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003IY498Y", "B00AEFYAC0", "B0029Z8K74", "B000NO39FG"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "asin": "B00005JP97", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5171vu3790L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Black Snake Moan [Theatrical Release]"}

{"description": "More exciting than The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe,The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspiancontinues the movie franchise based on C.S. Lewis' classic fantasy books. The movie picks up where the first left off... sort of. It's been a year since the Pevensie children--Peter (William Moseley), Susan (Anna Popplewell), Edmund (Skandar Keynes), and Lucy (Georgie Henley)--returned to England from Narnia, and they've just about resigned themselves to living their ordinary lives. But just like that, they're once again transported to a fantastical land, but one with a long-abandoned castle. It turns out that they are in Narnia again--and they themselves lived in that castle, but hundreds of years ago in Narnia time. They've been summoned back to help Prince Caspian (Stardust's Ben Barnes, resembling a young, cultured Keanu Reeves), the rightful heir to the throne who's become the target of his power-hungry uncle, King Mraz (Sergio Castellitto). And he's not the only one threatened: Mraz's people, the Telmarines, have pushed all the Narnians--the talking animals, the centaurs and other beasts, the walking trees--to the brink of extinction. Despite some alpha-male bickering, Peter and Caspian agree to fight Mraz alongside the remaining Narnians, including the dwarf Trumpkin (Peter Dinklage) and the swashbuckling mouse Reepicheep (voiced by Eddie Izzard). (Also appearing is Warwick Davis, who was in Willow and the 1989 BBC Prince Caspian.) But of course they most of all miss the noble lion, Aslan, who would have never let this happen to Narnia if he hadn't disappeared. Prince Caspian is epic, evoking memories of Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings films. (Some of the battle elements may seem too familiar, but they were in Lewis's book.) And it's appropriate for kids (Reepicheep could have come out of a Shrek movie), though the tone is dark and there is a lot of death, albeit bloodless. After two successful films, Disney and Walden Media's franchise has proved successful enough that many of the characters are scheduled to return in The Voyage of the Dawn Treader. --David HoriuchiStills fromThe Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian(Click for larger image)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004M1A21K", "B000E8M0VA", "B0047H7Q22", "B000LPS4J8", "B000OYCM5I", "B003ZHR6TS", "B00AEBB8KQ", "0061992887", "B00139W3NE", "B001NPD9JA", "B0016Q2D5M", "B00005JM5E", "0060598247", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B00HFFE8HE", "B004OBQDFM", "B002ZG99PY", "B000I0RQVI", "B001APZMJS", "B000U7WV1Y", "B00BEZTMFY", "B002ZG9904", "B005COPWZW", "B0011U52E2", "B00J0BTEZM", "B00AEFY9RG", "B008D1RDL2", "B0001HAISG", "B006VRRGNK", "B0013BM63O", "B00AEFYIQ8", "B00JBV4R3U", "B005LAIISA", "B001DHXT20", "B008JFUNTG", "B001HN694K", "B001QB5SS6", "B000AAF1TU", "B000GUJZ00", "B0013FSL3E", "B0012IWO0I", "B002ZG97YM", "B0000959N0", "B004AKCME8", "B000VNMMQG", "B0006GANV4", "B000Q66FB6", "B000HEWEE4", "B003HARV3Y", "B00CWM58WY", "B003L20IJM", "B002IPFWTE", "B00005JKZY", "1416995978", "B00005JG6M", "B000VBJEEG", "B001LPWGBO", "B008JFUO72", "B00128VA76", "B0009NZ2KG", "B00028HBES", "B0000640SC", "B00005JKZV", "B00003CWT6", "B00I6JOD2S", "B00JK531ES", "B004EPYZUS", "B001LXIDVS", "B004SIP75S", "B00005JN5E", "B004A8ZWUQ", "B004A8ZWW4", "B006P0FIGU", "B001NE80P4", "B00E5I2M6I", "B003ZHVJGO", "B000VWYJ86", "B002BWP49C", "B00275EHJG", "B00003CXC3", "B002ZG99KO", "B0030IIYYS", "B0006FYOTC", "B00EV1YZ96", "B00005JN4W", "B005LAIIMG", "B008JFUQ16", "B005LAIIPS", "B000BB1MI2", "B0030ZIZRC", "B0000DZ3EN", "B000W746GK", "B000UR9T8C", "B002PMV9FG", "B000BJ7BCK", "B00006ZXSK", "B001KVZ6FW", "B007R6DJP8"], "bought_together": ["B000E8M0VA", "B004M1A21K"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004M1A21K", "B000E8M0VA", "B003ZHR6TS", "0061992887"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 3310}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.68, "brand": "Walt Disney Video", "asin": "B00005JPH2", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/618uTYKkadL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian"}

{"description": "Critically hailed as an instant classic, Clint Eastwood'sLetters from Iwo Jimais a masterwork of uncommon humanity and a harrowing, unforgettable indictment of the horrors of war. In an unprecedented demonstration of worldly citizenship, Eastwood (from a spare, tightly focused screenplay by first-time screenwriter Iris Yamashita) has crafted a truly Japanese film, with Japanese dialogue (with subtitles) and filmed in a contemplative Japanese style, serving as both complement and counterpoint to Eastwood's previously released companion filmFlags of Our Fathers. Where the earlier film employed a complex non-linear structure and epic-scale production values to dramatize one of the bloodiest battles of World War II and its traumatic impact on American soldiers,Lettersreveals the battle of Iwo Jima from the tunnel- and cave-dwelling perspective of the Japanese, hopelessly outnumbered, deprived of reinforcements, and doomed to die in inevitable defeat. While maintaining many of the traditions of the conventional war drama, Eastwood extends his sympathetic touch to humanize \"the enemy,\" revealing the internal and external conflicts of soldiers and officers alike, forced by circumstance to sacrifice themselves or defend their honor against insurmountable odds. From the weary reluctance of a young recruit named Saigo (Kazunari Ninomiya) to the dignified yet desperately anguished strategy of Japanese commander Tadamichi Kuribayashi (played by Oscar-nominatedThe Last Samuraicostar Ken Watanabe), whose letters home inspired the film's title and present-day framing device,Letters from Iwo Jima(which conveys the bleakness of battle through a near-total absence of color) steadfastly avoids the glorification of war while paying honorable tribute to ill-fated men who can only dream of the comforts of home.--Jeff ShannonOn the DVDsLike the film itself, the two-disc special edition ofLetters from Iwo Jimais predominantly Japanese in content, and that's as it should be. Disc 1 presents the film in a  flawless widescreen transfer, with a Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround soundtrack that perfectly captures the film's wide dynamic range. The optional subtitles can be turned off for those wishing to immerse themselves in a completely Japanese viewing experience. Disc 2 opens with \"Red Sun, Black Sand: The Making ofLetters from Iwo Jima,\" a 20-minute behind-the-scenes documentary that concisely covers all aspects of production, from director Clint Eastwood's initial decision to create a companion piece toFlags of Our Fathers, to interview comments from principal cast and crew, the latter includingFlagsscreenwriters Paul Haggis andLettersscreenwriter Iris Yamashita, costume designer Deborah Hopper, editor Joel Cox, cinematographer Tom Stern, production designer James Murakami (taking over for the ailing Henry Bumstead), and coproducer Rob Lorenz. \"The Faces of Combat\" is an 18-minute featurette about selecting the Japanese (and Japanese-American) cast ofLetters, and how they were chosen through the international collaboration of Eastwood's long-time casting director Phyllis Huffman (who turned over some of her duties to her son while struggling with terminal illness) and Japanese casting associate Yumi Takada, who filled important roles with Japanese celebrities (like pop star Kazunari Ninomiya, who plays \"Saigo\") and unknown actors alike.\"Images from the Frontlines\" is a 3.5-minute montage of images from the film and behind-the-scenes, set to the sparse piano theme of Eastwood's original score. The remaining bonus features chronicle the world premiere ofLettersin Tokyo on November 15, 2006. The premiere itself is covered in a 16-minute featurette taped at the famous Budokan arena, where we see the red-carpet procession, a full-capacity audience despite cold November weather, and introductory comments from the film's primary cast and crew, many of them quite moving with regard to the satisfaction of working on a film that helps Japanese viewers come to terms with a painful chapter of their history. The following day's press conference (at the Grand Hyatt Tokyo hotel) is a 24-minute Q&A; session covering much of the same territory, with additional testimony from principal cast & crew. Throughout this two-day event, it's clear that Eastwood (referring to himself as \"a Japanese director who doesn't speak the Japanese language\") was warmly embraced by the Japanese, and thatLetters from Iwo Jimahad served its intended purpose, reminding us of the horrors of war while uniting both Japanese and Americans in somber reflection, 61 years after the battle of Iwo Jima.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000M4RG42", "B00005PJ8T", "B00001ZWUS", "B00AEBBA36", "B001IBIHQ4", "B0015D20FE", "B00005JK8K", "B004U7MQWY", "0767802470", "B00AEFXVCU", "B00006CXSS", "B00275EGWY", "B000NTPG7A", "B00AEFXRRO", "B000065U1N", "B00003CXTG", "0792839730", "0792841409", "B007S0DCUU", "B000FVQLRA", "079284646X", "B00005PJ8S", "B0009RCPUC", "B003ASLJO0", "B00AEBB86U", "B00AEFXGIY", "B000EHSVS2", "B000P0J09C", "B003ASLJOU", "B002T9H2LA", "B000EHSVSC", "B00B0U2SFE", "B000AQ69QI", "B002O3Z4WU", "B006OFN0SE", "B003AWRMCO", "B0000BWVCR", "B00AEFYBA6", "B002O3Z510", "B00008K76U", "B00AEFYENK", "B0007TKNLA", "B003ASLJQS", "B003ASLJPE", "B00003CXHJ", "B003ASLJQI", "B00003CXA6", "B0007TKNGA", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00096S4B2", "B008XJM7T2", "0782010040", "B00004XPPC", "B001TUZG4K", "B003AWRMCE", "B009XTF8NI", "B002GHHHPQ", "B00CZB9BE8", "B00004XPPG", "B00AEFXN9G", "B0002V7ON8", "B00AEFXVOI", "B000H5V8H2", "B003ASLJKE", "B005GYSV4M", "B00005N5S3", "B0041H55H6", "B0076XTIWU", "B003AWRMC4", "B00AEFY5B6", "0800177967", "B00009OOFA", "B003ASLJMW", "0792838408", "B000KGGJ0Y", "B006TTC5HC", "B004DY1VIO", "B000NQQ4OM", "B000E5N6KW", "B003AWRMCY", "B00AEFY0F2", "B003UESJHO", "B00DL48BM6", "B003XMKU16", "B00AZNEW5G", "B003ELKNH2", "B0007P0YKY", "B000095WW8", "B002CPMB9O", "B000ELL1R6", "B000A2WJBQ", "B002ID09BM", "B0051HCVEU", "B002ZG97RE", "B0006VL1J2", "B0001GF2GU", "0792841662", "0792843576", "6304765258", "B000MGTQ7U"], "bought_together": ["B000M4RG42", "B00001ZWUS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000M4RG42", "B000P1XITE", "B00AEBBA36", "B00001ZWUS"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 20999}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.44, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00005JPKE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51iZss0%2BzhL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Letters from Iwo Jima (Two-Disc Special Edition)"}
{"description": "At its core,Stomp the Yardis a romantic drama disguised as a dance film. Or is it the other way around? DJ (Columbus Short) is a troubled teen from Los Angeles who gets a chance for a better life when he is admitted into Atlanta's privileged Truth University. Just when he thought he had escaped a life of gangs, DJ finds himself in the middle of a \"war\" between two upper-crust fraternities where stepping (a popular dance form) is their weapon of choice. When DJ realizes the coed he falls for is the girlfriend of the school's champion stepper, he joins the rival fraternity to try to show her--and himself--that he's as good as anyone else there.Stomp the Yardis not an original film. Add some drums and you've gotDrumline. Change some of the characters around and you've gotSave the Last Dance. What sets the movie apart is the stepping. The precision involved at this level is impressively complicated and Short--a dancer and choreographer--is beautifully expressive both as an actor and a dancer. Sure the plot is predictable and hokey at times. But Short and Meagan Good (as his crush April) have wonderful chemistry together, and the supporting cast--including Harry J. Lennix as DJ's no-nonsense uncle--are delightful to watch. --Jae-Ha KimStills fromStomp the Yard(click for larger image)BeyondStomp the Yardon Amazon.comStomp the Yardon Blu-rayCD SoundtrackDance DVDs", "related": {"also_bought": ["B003SYQ7FC", "B000XSWVEC", "B0001MMGC2", "B000J3OTSM", "B000FS9ULC", "B000LRZHR8", "B00AMEZDJW", "B0012QCZ54", "B0001CNRS4", "B000YAF4Q6", "B004529NKC", "B009ANP4F4", "B00004Y2R1", "B0001FR3HW", "B00BTYPWDQ", "B00AMEZDII", "B001K2LFNI", "B000KHYN9C", "B0068FYZES", "6305505780", "B000FUTVLY", "B000BTITFI", "B000HDZKLO", "B003UEYBPI", "B004ULEF5G", "B003Y5H58S", "B000BITV9W", "B005LAIH86", "B00ANDDBBY", "B001DJLD12", "B00066FAC6", "B00004XPPD", "B00E1HIXA2", "B00AEFYAC0", "B00005JLON", "B00003CY51", "B00066FAQW", "B002DOBGWM", "B000PE0GRI", "B000WC39MM", "B00AEFXOKO", "B00EZ50RU4", "B00177YFYM", "B0034G4P1C", "B002GSXKOM", "B00000JGHV", "B000BOH8X2", "B00066FAVW", "B0014DZ2WS", "B000XT1P20", "B00000JGHO", "B00005JKE4", "0783240201", "B00003W8NT", "B00GOZ2LPM", "B0009X7BFK", "B00AMSM9AO", "B001P3SA94", "B000Q7ZNZ4", "B000LW7REE", "B003L16FCC", "B000FS9MXI", "B001K98MGE", "B00003CXMP", "B00AEFY0XE", "B00BEL4QFO", "B002CA68NO", "B0000YEE6M", "B003Y5H56K", "B00005JLQE", "0767812387", "B00005JD5J", "B00005JM10", "6305428409", "B00AEFY6TW", "B00KPYT9PS", "B00005LB86", "B0041QSZS8", "B0018RNF60", "B003QZSWU6", "B002VWNICM", "B0050OWMKW", "B0000524E5", "B004SIP93S", "B00AEFYE08", "B002E01LL6", "0780631234", "B0002B14UW", "B000NA1W3G", "B00H47IX5G", "B002VKB0LU", "B00465I1CE", "B00005JOZC", "B00005B8UA", "B001132GNY", "B0014QLEI6", "B000K4WPCC", "0783237367", "B005LAIH1S", "B00AEFYHVO"], "bought_together": ["B000J3OTSM", "B00AMEZDJW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00HZMZ272", "B000J3OTSM", "B00AMEZDJW", "B000XSWVEC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 21010}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.2, "brand": "Generic", "asin": "B00005JPK8", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51gZIdNnZcL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Stomp the Yard (Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "While much was made of the fact thatMarie Antoinetteelicited boos at Cannes, the many favorable reviews attracted less attention. Inspired by Antonia Fraser's biography, Sofia Coppola fashions a portrait that's just as dreamy asThe Virgin Suicides, her first literary adaptation, and the Oscar-winningLost in Translation. Set to a soundtrack of post-punk (a conceit that adds more interest than resonance), the teenaged Marie (Kirsten Dunst, quite good) may be shallow, but she's rarely unsympathetic. The story begins in the late-18th century as the Austrian Archduchess agrees to marry Louis-Auguste (Jason Schwartzman). After bidding adieu to her mother, Maria Theresa (Marianne Faithfull), she travels to France, where King Louis XV (Rip Torn) sets the rules--and the list is endless (Judy Davis' Comtesse de Noailles is the primary enforcer). As for the Dauphin, he's just a boy, really, with more interest in his key collection than their marriage bed. Should Marie produce an heir, it might be enough to sustain her--since life is nothing but an endless shopping spree--but clouds gather on the horizon as an impoverished populace rises up against their extravagant leaders. Coppola merely suggests what happens next, although history paints a darker picture. Filmed in and around the Chateau of Versailles,Marie Antoinetteis a riot of rustling gowns, sparkling jewels, and Manolo Blahnik-designed shoes. To say that style trumps substance does its maker a disservice, but the look of the thing does leave the deepest impression.--Kathleen C.

{"description": "Leonardo DiCaprio puts a handsome face on an ugly industry: In parts of Africa, diamond mining fuels civil warfare, killing thousands of innocents and drafting preteen children as vicious soldiers. DiCaprio (The Departed) plays Danny Archer, a white African soldier-turned-diamond-smuggler who gets wind of a large raw jewel found by Solomon Vandy, a native fisherman (Djimon Hounsou,In America) recently escaped from enslavement by a brutal rebel leader. Archer offers a deal: He'll help Vandy find his war-scattered family if Vandy will share the diamond with him. Drawn into this web of exploitation is journalist Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly,Little Children), who agrees to help if Archer will tell her the details of how conflict diamonds make their way into the hands of the corporations who sell them to the Western world. DiCaprio is compelling because he never flinches from Archer's utter ruthlessness; Archer ends up doing the morally justifiable thing, but only because his desperate greed has led him to it. Hounsou and Connelly, though saddled with all the moral and political speeches, rise above the cant and keep the movie's treacherously formulaic plot rooted in human characters. But in the end, the story won't stick with you as much as the dead stillness in the child soldiers' eyes; the horror of African civil strife refuses to be contained byBlood Diamond's uplifting message--and the movie is all the more potent as a result.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001N44BVQ", "B000M341QE", "B00005JLSB", "B00AEBB8NI", "B00080ZG10", "B004SIP7TE", "B006OFN0SE", "B002ZG980U", "B000NIVJF4", "B0007R4T3U", "B0016Q2D66", "B00049QQHI", "B001EZE5DI", "B00003CWM3", "B00008DP4C", "6305268827", "B000BYA5G4", "B00AEBB9F0", "B000Y7WGOW", "B004SIP7ZS", "B000065U1N", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B000095WW8", "B000U7169M", "B00DHHWXYY", "B000GFLKF8", "B004SIP8ZM", "B002O3Z510", "B002VWNIEA", "B002ZG99N6", "B0007DFJ0G", "B005LAIIJY", "0792839137", "B000KP62SE", "B000P0J0EW", "B000P0J09M", "B007SPPANM", "B00004XPPG", "B000C20VPA", "B00011CZRE", "B002QEHPQU", "B00005JN2Z", "B00AEBB9CS", "B00003CXWV", "B00AEFY5B6", "B00001ZWUS", "B00H9KKGTO", "B00005JN0W", "B002T9H2LA", "B000MTEFXC", "B003L20IG0", "B00AEBB86A", "B00005JKBC", "B0013XZ2QK", "B0000ACOXL", "B005LAIGRS", "B002AT8K9W", "B0007KIFGE", "B00AZNEW5G", "B003ASLJO0", "B000T28PII", "B002DU39GW", "B002ZG97RE", "B000LC55F2", "B00003CXTG", "B00AEBBA36", "B00B0U2SFE", "B003ASLJQI", "B002CPMB9O", "B00BB67UNW", "B000MXPE7O", "0783231202", "B000FVQLQQ", "B00AEFXVCU", "B00AEFXRRO", "B000A3XY5A", "B002JCSWV6", "B00005JNQA", "B004EPYZP8", "B0050MB4OO", "B000P0J0AG", "B000C65Z1G", "B00275EGWY", "B00005B6JZ", "B0006GANPA", "B00AEBB9NM", "B002XMGGK6", "B000C20VRS", "B0007P0XBO", "B003UESJME", "B000QXDED6", "B00AHTYI5M", "B001P9KR8U", "B004A8ZX28", "B008JFUNKU", "B003ASLJQS", "B002VWNICC", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00005BCKF", "B000NOIX48"], "bought_together": ["B000M341QE", "B002ZG980U"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AEBB8NI", "B00H9KKGTO", "B008MILL8W", "B000BYA5G4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 106777}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.96, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00005JPGO", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61MN8-6skUL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Blood Diamond (Two-Disc Special Edition)"}

{"description": "One of the first things a viewer notices aboutCloverfieldis that it doesn't play by ordinary storytelling rules, making this intriguing horror film as much a novelty as an event. Told from the vertiginous point-of-view of a camcorder-wielding group of friends,Cloverfieldbegins like a primetime television soap opera about young Manhattanites coping with changes in their personal lives. Rob (Michael Stahl-David) is leaving New York to take an executive job at a company in Japan. At his goodbye party in a crowded loft, Rob&#x92;s brother Jason (Mike Vogel) hands a camcorder to best friend Hud (T.J. Miller), who proceeds to tape the proceedings over old footage of Rob&#x92;s ex-girlfriend, Beth (Odette Yustman)--images shot during happy times in that now-defunct relationship. Naturally, Beth shows up at the party with a new beau, bumming Rob out completely. Just before one's eyes glaze over from all this heartbreaking stuff (captured by Hud, who's something of a doofus, in laughably shaky camerawork), the unexpected happens: New York is suddenly under attack from a Godzilla-like monster stomping through midtown and destroying everything and everybody in sight. Rob and company hit the streets, but rather than run with other evacuees, they head toward the center of the storm so that Rob can rescue an injured Beth. There are casualties along the way, but the journey into fear is fascinating and immediate if emotionally remote--a consequence of seeing these proceedings through the singular, subjective perspective of a camcorder and of a story that intentionally leaves major questions unanswered: Who or what is this monster? Where did it come from? The lack of a backstory, and spare views of the marauding creature, are clever ways by producer J.J. Abrams and director Matt Reeves to keep an audience focused exclusively on what&#x92;s on the screen.  But it also makesCloverfieldcuriously uninvolving. Ultimately,Cloverfield, with its spectacular effects brilliantly woven into a home-video look, is a celebration of infinite possibilities in this age of accessible, digital media.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B004EPYZQ2", "B00IO9D3ZI", "B00EMMDMKM", "B002SJIO5E", "B0044ZOI32", "B001AR0D4A", "B004BZ5AMS", "B001MVYUQQ", "B003BJO8KU", "B0018AG6X6", "B005LAIGPU", "B00IO8VMB6", "B000PKG8SS", "B003Y5H5GU", "B00BPA2PGG", "B0017U7PT6", "B001YV502C", "B0013FBS20", "B008JFUR10", "B001KZVQJI", "B001CW7ZW6", "B0035WTJFW", "B000Y7U98W", "B003ABZGRI", "B000VDDWEC", "B000VDDWEM", "B002JT69IM", "B00164EAC8", "B002ZG981E", "B00AEFXORM", "B001DZOC3W", "B008SAPC20", "B003Y5H59M", "B00HERVMTK", "B00AVSFIV2", "B0032KNA4I", "B000L212HW", "B001FB55I0", "B0018O4YSQ", "B002ZG997M", "B002ZG9788", "B008G33O0G", "B000VDDWE2", "B00K2CHVSK", "B001GCUO5W", "B005J4TLQG", "B000PC6A3E", "B0027VT9ES", "B001F7MSG6", "B0051T46XM", "B00111YM60", "B001GZ6QEC", "B002HR1W1K", "B004SIPA4G", "B001OQCVII", "B001JNNDBA", "B001GKJ2FC", "B000WQWPKA", "B000OT6V00", "B0021L8UXK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004EPYZQ2", "B00IO8VMB6", "B004LWZW4W", "B005LAIHY0"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "asin": "B00005JPXY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Wm5GO98oL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Cloverfield [Theatrical Release]"}

{"description": "Jennifer Garner's lips grow more Angelina-esque every year. In the romantic comedyCatch and Release, Garner (Alias, 13 Going On 30) plays Gray Wheeler, a young woman whose fiance dies unexpectedly before the wedding, leaving Gray unable to afford her home--so she moves in with her fiance's best friends, Sam (Kevin Smith, director ofClerksandDogma) and Dennis (Sam Jaeger,Lucky Number Slevin). But the presence of another old friend named Fritz (Timothy Olyphant,Deadwood) leads to the unveiling of a secret: Gray's fiance had a child with another woman.Catch and Releaselacks the clear story structure that most romantic comedies are built on, but trades it for a richer sense of the ambiguities of human relationships. Garner, though lovely and personable, is a bit bland--fortunately, she's surrounded by actors with all kinds of edges, including Smith (who shows an unexpected and uncloying earnest side), Fiona Shaw (from theHarry Pottermovies) as the fiance's grieving mother, and Juliette Lewis (Cape Fear), who demonstrates once again her powers as a fearless and surprising actress.Catch and Releaseis an uneven movie, with a remarkably elegant visual style that sometimes clashes with the workmanlike dialogue, but it can't be written off as the same old Hollywood claptrap. Though a happy ending is inevitable, the path it takes has some surprising turns and flashes of unexpected emotional depth.--Bret FetzerStills fromCatch and Release(click for larger image)BeyondCatch and Releaseon Amazon.comMore Films from Jennifer GarnerCD SoundtrackMore Romantic Comedies", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0038N9X3Q", "B002UJIY7A", "B000K2V7E6", "B000MQC9H4", "B00K2CHSS8", "B004SIP9RO", "B000N6U0E2", "B00316DDUO", "B004EPZ070", "B0012RLX88", "B003L20IG0", "B002ZG988M", "B002ZG989G", "B0009OL7Z4", "B000LPR5CA", "B001OQCUZM", "B00164KYV4", "B0000560PU", "B003B3V0N4", "B00KNALRZ4", "B00866JL96", "B004EPYZP8", "B00JA3RVG4", "B00005PJ7G", "B003Y5H574", "B0021L8UXA", "6304765266", "B00H9LHVHI", "B00AKGG6JS", "B00005JPSM", "B000P0J08S", "B004LWZW9C", "B003EYVXXC", "B002K0WBXW", "B002ZG99UE", "B00H7LJ2UO", "B00AEFYQE2", "B00K2CHUWW", "B004SBQAN8", "B000ZS8GW6", "B000HEWEE4", "B002P413IC", "B00006ZXSO", "B00AEFY99O", "B000EMGJ7C", "B005LAIGSM", "B003BV8ICC", "B000YABYLA", "B004SIP8JI", "B000YAA68C", "B00007E2F5", "B0038N9WKU", "B001HN69C2", "B00E8RKHWW", "B00FZ4KR4U", "B004EPZ0BG", "B005LAIGRS", "B00005JN3W", "B0021L8V3Y", "B00GUO2SKA", "B000CEV3KU", "B0000VD02Y", "B00008G7UF", "B00HLTD3ZW", "B00IVLRA62", "B000023VTP", "0767810856", "B0004Z3242", "B0009UZGIM", "B00C1LIYWM", "B005LAIGXW", "B001WAKOW6", "B00118T632", "B00B5J6A7W", "B008JFUNKU", "B005LAIIKS", "B004IK30PA", "B0006A9FIM", "B004SIP8LG", "B0038M2APA", "B004BFTFBU", "B00J11U54K", "B002ZG9968", "B00005JNP4", "B00AIBZMD6", "B00006ZXSN", "B0007P0Y7C", "B0021L8UO4", "B0038RSJB4", "B00GEKO51U", "B00AEBB8NS", "B00F8PTALC", "B000683VI4", "B00008NRI7", "B002OVED88", "B0007IO6NM", "B0045HCJJ4", "B000J3OTSM", "B000E6EHE0", "B00IGBI052"], "bought_together": ["B0038N9X3Q"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003L20IG0", "B004EPYZP8", "B00GPWEPZ8", "B002UJIY7A"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 20294}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.98, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B00005JPF3", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51%2B7mjxLmdL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Catch and Release"}
{"description": "The fact-based mystery ofHollywoodlandtakes place in 1959, when the death ofAdventures of SupermanTV star George Reeves cast a pall over the waning days of golden-age Hollywood. As written by Paul Bernbaum, this intriguing whodunit effectively evokes the tainted atmosphere that surrounded Reeves' death (officially ruled a suicide but never conclusively solved), and speculates on circumstances to suggest that Reeves may have been murdered. In combining the melancholy course of Reeves' career with the investigation of a down-and-out private detective into the possible causes of Reeves' death, the film evolves into an engrossing study of parallels between lives on either side of the Hollywood dream. Building upon a distinguished career in TV including episodes of HBO'sThe Sopranos,RomeandSix Feet Under, director Allen Coulter finds a satisfying balance between the tragic overtones of the Reeves case and the time-honored elements of the gumshoe genre, with Adrien Brody doing fine work as private eye Louis Simo, a fictional composite character who is our conduit to the desperate yearnings of Reeves' final months.In a critically acclaimed performance, Ben Affleck plays Reeves in moody flashbacks, caught betweenSupermanstardom and financial dependence on his lover Toni Mannix (Diane Lane), the somewhat predatory wife of Hollywood \"fixer\" and MGM honcho Eddie Mannix (Bob Hoskins), whose mob connections suggest foul play as Simo's investigation progresses. Reeves' subsequent lover (played by Robin Tunney) may also be culpable, and as Simo's own personal life unravels, his empathy for Reeves takes on added significance.

{"description": "In this inspirational costume drama, Michael Apted (49 Up) recounts a period in British history sure to be unfamiliar to most Americans. In fact, his eye-opening biography of 18th century abolitionist William Wilberforce (Ioan Gruffudd) is likely to come as a revelation to many Britons, as well. After all, despite the presence of his wife, Barbara (Romola Garai), this isn't a particularly \"sexy\" story, but itisa powerful one. The title comes from John Newton's hymn \"Amazing Grace\" (\"I once was lost but now am found\"). Newton (Albert Finney) was a former slaveholder, who became a clergyman and spent his days repenting. While America had John Brown, England had Wilberforce, and Newton is one of many who helped the MP to abolish slavery in the UK. The story begins towards the end of Wilberforce's mission when he's sick with colitis and addicted to laudanum. Apted continues to alternate between 1797 and 1789, when Wilberforce was fitter and more idealistic, and ends in 1807 as his efforts come to fruition. Apted and writer Steven Knight (Dirty Pretty Things) do right by their hero. UnlikeAmistad, however, slaves are largely off-screen, with the exception of author Equiano (Senegalese vocalist Youssou N'Dour).Amazing Gracereserves its focus for the politicians who risked their reps for the greater good, like Wilberforce and Prime Minister Pitt (an excellent Benedict Cumberbatch), and those more concerned with the income slavery provided their constituents, like Lord Tarleton (Ciar&#xE1;n Hinds) and the Duke of Clarence (Toby Jones).--Kathleen C.

But it is not until another stranger, the handsome Roux (Johnny Depp -- SLEEPY HOLLOW), arrives in town that Vianne is finally able to recognize her own desires!", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004SEUIXS", "B004XVMCMG", "B0000VD02Y", "0780621611", "B000LXHK2C", "0140282033", "B000053VAZ", "B004SIP9U6", "B002RSDW80", "B0034PHWG8", "B00008G7UF", "B004SIP7PS", "B00006ZXSI", "B0042816YK", "B004SIP7F8", "B00005TNEQ", "B004SIP7D0", "B000F7CECK", "B00AEBB9F0", "B000CBG5PG", "0783240171", "B000ETRCN0", "B002ZG988M", "B00005R87R", "B000EHRVOW", "B003B3V0W0", "B00166UFTS", "B004SIP6C2", "B00AEBB8YW", "B00005JKG1", "B001LPWGBY", "B004SEUJK0", "B000UVV26A", "B0000AOV4I", "B00005JPSM", "630560097X", "B00L16P1I8", "B0011FLH14", "B005S9EJ14", "B00CEIOGZG", "B005CFBZX4", "B000YDBPAM", "B00EIBO8T6", "B001HN69AY", "B004SIP9RO", "B004SIP8JI", "B005MYEQ4U", "B0073U2EWM", "B00AEBBA72", "B0000CE684", "B00KQTGWPC", "B005ETAM4Q", "0147509785", "B0062VL4QA", "6305133468", "B001HN694K", "B00AZMFO6I", "B00006ZXSK", "B000LPR4U8", "B00006FMUW", "B000C8STWQ", "B000CCBCAS", "B007UW9W5U", "B001NLJ3NU", "B000BB1MI2", "B0045HCJJY", "B00DW5ILUG", "B00AEBB8OC", "B006ISJQ1W", "B0002234LS", "6305212112", "B000HT3PPG", "B001ECDVK4", "B0009OL7Z4", "B0001I55M4", "B000EDWKXI", "B00001W9G0", "B00004X13T", "B004SIP8W0", "B00000K3TN", "B0064MT1FI", "6305213283", "6304765266", "0800141741", "B000BNX3B4", "076782170X", "B00AEFY4CG", "B000056PMU", "B000F3UAFC", "B00003CXPD", "B000023VTP", "B0038N9WKU", "6304907729", "6305291403", "B00003A9QI", "B004GJYRA0", "B000077VR3", "B004SIP7ZS", "B00008G8LG", "B000RF7XYO"], "bought_together": ["B004SEUIXS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004SEUIXS", "B00C888MJ8", "B0000VD02Y", "0140282033"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 66054}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.98, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B00005K3OT", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51BVvKaN4EL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Chocolat (Miramax Collector's Series)"}

{"description": "Innocuous, innocent, and somewhat idiotic, Disney's bubbleheaded road-movie comedy plays as a farcical remake of the 1976 cult TV-movie melodramaThe Boy in the Plastic Bubble. Jake Gyllenhaal is the goodhearted innocent raised in a sort of human Habitrail of plastic rooms and rubber tunnels. To win back the girl of his dreams (Marley Shelton), he steps out of his indoor greenhouse and into a homemade Ziplock bubble suit. It's the usual story: naive innocent bounces down the highway like a beach ball with legs and wins over the wacky supporting cast of soft-hearted bikers, zombielike teenage cultists, and orphaned \"freaks\" through purity and pluck. The premise wears thin after a while, but Gyllenhaal keeps the film bounding along with goofy innocence and energetic eagerness. Swoosie Kurtz costars as his religious-zealot clinging mom. Watch for Fabio in an inspired cameo.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00003CXPS", "6305433925", "B00005V9HR", "B00AEFXPG2", "B00005JKJJ", "B00005YUPD", "B0045HCJRG", "B00008L3W3", "B000CEPE5A", "B00102F5WK", "B0000797IO", "6305428549", "B00005JLOB", "B00006JU8B", "B00003CXIS", "B00441GYVA", "B004SUDQ22", "630529142X", "B001R23GBU", "B001FB55L2", "B001ECDVKE", "B000VXWX7E", "B00LBHOCHS", "B00DW5IL92", "B004L3AR0K", "B0000AC8LR", "B000089778", "B00008K7AM", "B00BLN4UPG", "B00BTYNXJG", "B000069HQ2", "B00003CXS7", "B00005RYLX", "B000EMGJAO", "B00005JOFQ", "B000DZIGDU", "B0023TCWE8", "B004GJYRA0", "B00AEFXIUK", "B00005JH9O", "B00AEFZE48", "B000FP2OPO", "B000031EFY", "0783227345", "B0006FYOTC", "B00BLN4V0A", "B000QUU4MS", "B002NZK5U0", "B0007KIFXW", "0783226896", "B0009ZE9VW", "B0006HBZE2", "B000089773", "0783230494", "B000ELJAEM", "B00AEFYPXY", "B000A0GP0Y", "B00007JMEB", "B004XQO90O", "B002XUBDRY", "0780625528", "B00E1HIX66", "B0016MJ6GA", "B0006GANPA", "B000WZEZGI", "B0015RRNN4", "B00000F0AD", "6305870179", "B001G5T6GW", "B00005PJ6N", "B003UYUQZW", "B00005JMX6", "B00003CXK7", "B00000K3U4", "B000EGDBZ6", "B00008979O", "B000MNOXYY", "B001GC9VK6", "B00005JM4Q", "B00005NGAY", "B00AEBB9GY", "B000BUE5E6", "B00AEBB89W", "B000QUU7L6", "B00008L3U1", "0792840127", "1558908404", "B00005QT9P", "B00AG4714S", "B000089771", "B004SIP7K8", "B00005PJ6M", "B00006ADFT", "B008220CQU", "B00049QQHI", "B004P7CN5O", "B0050PYNP8", "B002GHHHL0", "B004HO6I2E", "0790751445"], "bought_together": ["6305433925", "B0045HCJRG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00003CXPS", "B000CEPE5A", "6305433925", "B0045HCJRG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 22273}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.5, "brand": "DISNEY", "asin": "B00005U8QN", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51B5N45K6VL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Bubble Boy"}

{"description": "This is the beginning of a beautiful friendship. As its ratings following the tragic events of September 11, 2001, illustrated,Friendshas matured into television's most beloved comfort show. The peerless ensemble--Jennifer Aniston, a pre-Arquette Courtney Cox, Emmy winner Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry, and David Schwimmer--makes a lasting first impression in the first season's 24 episodes, which are presented chronologically on four discs. The perky \"Pilot\" introduces unlucky-in-love Monica, runaway bride Rachel, sad sack Ross, New Age ditz Phoebe, wise guy Chandler, and womanizer Joey. The focus of the first season is Ross's unrequited love for Rachel, but we have these moments to remember: the arrival of Marcel the monkey (\"The One with the Monkey\"); Monica, Rachel, and Phoebe's \"cleansing ritual\" (\"The One with the Candy Hearts\"); the escalating game of shower peek-a-boo (\"The One with the Boobies\"); Joey as Al Pacino's butt double (\"The One with the Butt\"); Ross taking lessons from Joey in how to \"talk dirty\" (\"The One with the Stoned Guy\"); former \"Must-See TV\" stars Helen Hunt and George Clooney (\"The One with Two Parts\"); and Chandler spilling the beans to Rachel about Ross's feelings for her (\"The One Where Rachel Finds Out\"). Though its devoted fans can recite these episodes chapter and verse,Friendsmaintains its sparkle through repeat viewings, a testament to the sharp writing as well as the cast's lightning-in-a-bottle chemistry and lived-in performances. The episodes are presented uncut and extended, with previously unseen dialogue and scenes. And those who hateFriendsand would like to drown the characters in the opening credits' fountain are directed to the episode \"The One with the Boobies,\" in which guest star Fisher Stevens hilariously nails the \"dysfunctional group dynamic ... co-dependent, emotionally stunted, sitting in your stupid coffeehouse and you're all like, 'Define me, define me.'\" Among the set's special features are an informative \"Pilot\" episode commentary by the show's creators, who at one point reveal that Monica was originally conceived as a Janeane Garafalo type (how's that for a road not traveled?). More obsessed fans can take a virtual tour of coffee shop Central Perk, the center of theFriendsuniverse, or match wits with the \"How Well Do You Know Your Friends?\" trivia quiz.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000068CNX", "B0000844MI", "B003TNW04Y", "B0000C2IXN", "B003TNW030", "B0006ZM8M2", "B003TNW03K", "B0001AW066", "B003TNW03A", "B005IA9JQ8", "B005IA9JQI", "B005IA9JRM", "B005IA9JSG", "B00005JLEX", "B005MG8UNG", "B00020HAWY", "B000HT3P7E", "B00B1LKXPY", "B008L0YMZA", "B0009VBTP0", "B008L0YN18", "B000TM1CKQ", "B000W91RUG", "B003SNJO5S", "B00005JO9J", "B000ERVK5S", "B0001BS3IY", "B00B04NJ1M", "B002N5N4M6", "B00009Y3RW", "B000NOKFH6", "B00B04NII6", "B00IVLRA62", "B0019CSXAM", "B002N5N4FS", "B0000E32X2", "B001BNFR6M", "B0058JEHTS", "B00005JLIC", "B0002UE1WQ", "B0024FAR6Q", "B00EQ2KU7G", "B00008AOX3", "B00382S9SW", "B00008NV4G", "B0058J3S16", "B0002I838Q", "B000RF1QE2", "B000GETTKM", "B000YA82GA", "B0024FAD8I", "B002BJGYTY", "B001VPJYZ0", "B007C8RZL0", "B003R0MF3A", "B003SNJXMC", "B0000CGNEC", "0792845773", "B0007YXRCW", "B004GJYRFA", "B001A4VH2U", "B0019Z3P84", "B003L77GDS", "B002WC89WK", "B00005JNOG", "B007C8RZQ0", "B000SINT4S", "B00004RFCM", "B0015I2S74", "B00382S9UA", "B0030VANIU", "B008LCRAFC", "B002JVWR7M", "B007C8RZJW", "B006JSXYPA", "B008KZX7W0", "B000R9YLKY", "B005GT3XD6", "B002JVWQSW", "6305428034", "B000HT3P6U", "B00133QNS6", "B00AG473GE", "B000QFCD7W", "B00382S9U0", "B00382S9TQ", "B000WQWPRS", "B0032UYFAQ", "B008LCRA98", "B006WZIB1C", "B003Y5H574", "B00FRILRW0", "B00AEFYM2S", "B000BOH98G", "B0038N9X3Q", "B003L77GE2", "B00133QNSG", "B003VTKZA2", "B002DPPH6W", "B0058JEHSO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005IA9JVI", "B005IA9JQ8", "B00B1LN8WY", "B000068CNX"]}, "price": 1.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 48009}, "asin": "B00005YU81", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HRCAPXNAL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Friends: Season 1"}

{"description": "Royal Tenenbaum (Gene Hackman) and his wife, Etheline (Anjelica Huston), had three children -- Chas, Margot, and Richie -- and then they separated. Chas (Ben Stiller) started buying real estate in his early teens and seemed to have an almost preternatural understanding of international finance. Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow) was a playwright and received a Braverman Grant of $50,000 in the ninth grade.

Distraught by the sudden, tragic death of his wife (Debra Messing), John Klein (Richard Gere), a journalist for The Washington Post, finds himself mysteriously drawn to a small West Virginia town when his car inexplicably strands him. Rescued by the sympathetic but skeptical local police sergeant (Laura Linney), he soon learns that many of the town's residents have been beset by bizarre events, including sightings of an eerie \"moth-like\" entity, similar to the one seen by his late wife. Investigating further and having his own terrifying encounters with the creature, he becomes obsessed with the idea that this supernatural being canpredict impending calamities and is trying to warn the town of one.

Nicole Kidman  plays Sophia, a chain-smoking, mascara-smudged, wildly sexual mail-order bride  from Russia who answers an Internet plea for companionship from a lonely  British bank employee, John (Ben Chaplin). For a while, the two make a  startling and intriguing pair: she apparently speaks no English and he  naively frets over the veracity of the Web business that brought them  together. The gorgeous Kidman and sad-eyed Chaplin are briefly the engine of  their own unique movie, but then the other shoe drops. Sophia, obviously up to  something mysterious, is paid a visit on her birthday by two Russian  \"cousins\" (French filmmaker Mathieu Kassovitz and one of his own frequent  stars, Vincent Cassel, also seen inBrotherhood of the Wolf).  Suddenly, John's quest for a lover becomes a web of deceit and corruption.  Directed and cowritten (with his brother Tom) by Jez Butterworth,Birthday Girlis hampered a bit by sluggishness and insufficient character  development. But it is also original and strikingly entertaining.Tom  Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0045O2PHS", "B0007P0X9G", "6305161933", "B004P7CMUU", "B000NO1XG8", "B0002DB52M", "B004AE3QYE", "B000068QPV", "B0002W4UDE", "B0013D8LKO", "B0011NVC8Y", "B006YTGLE0", "B009R8Q8Y8", "B00AEFYUQQ", "B00004Y87P", "B009B1EPQ4", "B000ASDFGI", "B005DR64OQ", "B00B4HM6XW", "B00006L92K", "6305310335", "B0000ZMGWK", "B00005JPUN", "B001CIOCLC", "B00AEFYUIO", "B0021L9M2I", "B009M4KTUG", "B008D1RD6W", "B0000640VK", "B0072BNJZ8", "B000ENC5YW", "B006YTGL86", "B00BSN0VZW", "B00AEFY8MM", "B00EVU3T26", "B00D3DJIG8", "B00CPTUO1Y", "B001E95ZNS", "B00HF98SPS", "B000DZ8540", "B00005JNQA", "B000ALM40I", "B004YCKKFK", "B00003CY5G", "B00096S494", "B0037QGS0A", "B00009OOFG", "B0010SAGHS", "B000FWHW68", "B0007W6HVM", "B00005LPZW", "B00DVH20MA", "B000EQHXNW", "B00030WW4O", "B00005U14H", "B000068V9U", "B00BTYJYP8", "B0010DM3R4", "B0045HCIYA", "B000YENUI6", "B00008L3S6", "B0041KKZIM", "078322933X", "B00260HH1W", "0790776960", "B007UW9W32", "B0009PW4BE", "B0010HOZS0", "B0064MT1LM", "6305213305", "B002UJIY2A", "0767812158", "B006GL8NQ0", "B002S5N052", "B0004Z32NI", "B0001932ZU", "B00BNWWVFG", "B0006GANPA", "B00005Y1UX", "B00CX7OW1G", "6305132917", "B003UAKEBW", "B008NA3I30", "6305308837", "B000EQ5SRK", "B00005O5B8", "B000DZ7YN8", "B00EMAGKNU", "B0059XTUB8", "B0040J1RX6", "B000AOEMT6", "B003IIST9U", "0783229402", "B0073U2EWM", "0767802616", "B00008972P", "B009OCR2U6", "B005Z9MGRG", "B000JBXXYK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0045O2PHS", "B004AE3QYE", "B0007P0X9G", "B004P7CMUU"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 92824}, "asin": "B000067J3P", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514VCGGEXQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Birthday Girl"}

{"description": "UFOwas Gerry Anderson's first live-action TV series after a decade of producing such children's animated classics asStingray(1963) andThunderbirds(1964). The premise ofUFO, which ran for a single season of 26 episodes in 1970, was like a more serious version of Anderson'sCaptain Scarlet(1967): in the near future of 1980, a high-tech secret organization, SHADO, waged covert war against mysterious alien attackers. Ed Bishop played the American head of SHADO--he had been previously featured inCaptain Scarletand Anderson'sDoppelganger(1969)--though in all other respects this was a thoroughly British production. As with all Anderson series,UFOevidenced remarkable technological inventiveness and groundbreaking production values, coupled with startling lapses in fundamental logic too numerous to list.Much more adult in story and content than earlier Anderson productions, and surprisingly dark with its pragmatic view of human nature and downbeat endings, the show now seems like a forerunner ofThe X-Filesand the equally short-livedDark Skies(1996). Barry Gray's memorable theme and atmospheric music greatly enhanced the overall impact. Stylishly made, though terribly sexist by current standards and featuring eye-catching costumes more fitted for a campy dress party than the front line of a futuristic war, this cult classic eventually evolved intoSpace 1999(1975).TheUFODVDs have been beautifully designed and produced. The mono sound is exceptionally strong, and the restored and remastered picture is almost unbelievably good for a 1970 TV show. With barely a flaw anywhere, the episodes look so clear, colorful, and detailed that they could have been filmed last week. This four-disc box features the first 13 episodes: \"Identified,\" \"Computer Affair,\" \"Flight Path,\" \"Exposed,\" \"Survival,\" \"Conflict,\" \"The Dalotek Affair,\" \"A Question of Priorities,\" \"Ordeal,\" \"The Square Triangle,\" \"Court Martial,\" \"Close Up,\" and \"Confetti Check A-OK.\"--Gary S Dalkin", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00007GZYE", "B0000524FJ", "B002DQSKLU", "B000065Q9A"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0000AZKJ8", "B00007GZYE"]}, "price": 48.73, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 305953}, "asin": "B0000687BN", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51C4VGK0QZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "UFO, Set 1"}

{"description": "From the director of Fatal Attraction comes \"a steamy thriller\" (People Magazine) about physical passion so intense, it consumes everything - and everyone - in its path.

{"description": "This first movie from the Discovery Channel favorite opens with a plot of international intrigue over a downed satellite, but within four minutes Steve Irwin is belly flopping after a baby croc on the outback floor. Steve and his nerves-of-steel sidekick wife, Terri, are asked to relocate a cattle-chomping crocodile before it's shot by a local rancher. This same reptile happened to swallow the intelligence-gathering device that fell to earth, and so begins the goofball premise of this lark of a movie. The feds believe the Irwins are appropriating their classified info, and the Irwins think they're running from poachers. Quibblers may object to Irwin's frequent interruptions to introduce a bird-eating spider or paw through croc dung, butCrocodile Hunterfans wouldn't have it any other way. This 89-minute film is rated PG for action violence/peril and mild language. But unless you consider \"crikey\" an obscenity, it's a safe bet for family viewing.

TransplantingKing Learto a Texas cattle ranch was a risky proposition, but as star and co-executive producer (with his wife and fellowStar Trek: The Next Generationalumnus, Wendy Neuss), Patrick Stewart brings his formidable Shakespearean training to bear on a condensed but satisfying interpretation. Whereas Akira Kurosawa'sRanrequired a gender-switching overhaul of Shakespeare's tragedy, this handsomely mounted TNT Original retains the feuding sisterhood of Lear's undoing. As aging cattle baron John Lear, Stewart sets his downfall in motion, dividing his land and loyalties among daughters played with stalwart fortitude by Marcia Gay Harden, Lauren Holly, and Julie Cox.

{"description": "Directed by Claude Chabrol, Les Biches is a landmark in film history:  its theme of bisexuality and upper-class decadence is surpassed only by its cool precision  of cinematic style and exceptionally subtle performances.

{"description": "Despite critical roasting and a blink-and-you-missed it theatrical release,Half Past Deadis surprisingly not half bad. Once you recognize this bastard child's recent action-flick heritage (The Rockbeing the most obvious of a dozen pilfered plot lines), you can kick back and enjoy the unexpected perks that arise when a deep-cover FBI sleuth (Steven Seagal) accompanies a convicted crook (rapper Ja Rule) into \"New Alcatraz\" prison. A death-row killer (Bruce Weitz) sits on a $200 million goldmine, keeping his secret as a bargaining chip when criminal commandos (led by the ever-cool Morris Chestnut) drop in for a lethally greedy raid. After cutting his teeth on trashy, short-lived TV series, director Don Michael Paul can't do much to help the puffy, career-tanking Seagal, but he's got lively allies in Ja Rule and alleged \"has-been\" Nia Peeples (forget Lara Croft, this baberocks), and even legendary action-TV producer Stephen J.

To Scott's dismay, he is teamed with undefeated middleweight champion Kelly Robinson (Eddie Murphy), who is slated to fight in Budapest where suspected Stealth thief, arms dealer and boxing fan Arnold Gundars (Malcolm McDowell) is throwing a party in honor of the boxers. Scott uses cool spy equipment to encourage the egotistical Robinson to work with him.

{"description": "Since winning an Academy Award for his exuberant performance inJerry Maguire, Cuba Gooding Jr. has gotten little but static from critics for a spate of calamitous career choices not seen since '80s-vintage Burt Reynolds.

This does not play well with the school's patient but questioning principal (Alfre Woodard); the school's biggest athletic booster, who views Radio as a distraction; the man's son, the team's star player, who plays cruel pranks on the trusting Radio; and the Coach's teenage daughter, who feels neglected. Almost all will be won over by Radio's trusting and good nature. Based on aSports Illustratedstory,Radiowas adapted for the screen by Mike Rich, screenwriter ofThe Rookie, and as in that superior family film, the heroics are mostly off the field. As Coach says, with all the subtlety of a blitz, \"We're not the ones been teaching Radio; he's the one been teaching us.\" The ending, in which we see the actual Radio, still cheering his team on 26 years later, will melt the most cynical hearts.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JPBO", "B002VECM6S", "B000056VP4", "B000066HAS", "B00004W221", "B000J3OTT6", "B000EXZFCQ", "0792843592", "6305531293", "B00AEFXOKO", "B000068NNU", "B001LGXIA6", "B002NZK5UK", "0788815466", "B000KHYN9C", "6305428352", "B0001US66Y", "B000N6U0E2", "B00000IQV7", "B00004TJQJ", "B002D755AI", "B00125WAWS", "B0006FYOTC", "B00AEBB9F0", "B00005JNEW", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00KPYT9PS", "B000FVQLQQ", "B000KLQUS0", "B0068FZ0GK", "B000Q7ZNZ4", "B002VWNIBI", "B000K2UGZM", "B001FB55NK", "B004KPLVX6", "B00722MQE2", "B0026S2TU8", "B004DK5CW4", "B0001ADAVK", "630542845X", "B00005JKWX", "B000CDSS18", "B0000YTP02", "B00006HAWN", "B00AEFZ63M", "6305133468", "B00AEFXOE0", "B009NNM9OA", "B000MNOX94", "B000PHVZNE", "B00AEFY17E", "B000G1R394", "B001QB5SS6", "B005OZVXCU", "B000FVR1T2", "B0000AM6NV", "B002YMWQ2M", "B002VWNICM", "B0023UZBBI", "B009YQJ2Q4", "B00005JMCN", "B0026JI1R2", "B0002TSZI8", "B000KF0GWW", "078324021X", "6305428387", "B0038M2AZA", "B008FCX2D2", "B000QQLVPQ", "0767836359", "0783225733", "B000X5RBXG", "B004SEUJOQ", "B00KD5HFJG", "B00AMEZDJW", "B00AEFXV3E", "B000RBA6C4", "B00AEFXY6I", "0767802497", "B000FFJYB6", "B000274T94", "B0000648ZR", "B00133KFGW"], "bought_together": ["B002VECM6S", "B000056VP4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000X5RBXG", "B000056VP4", "B000J3OTT6", "B00005JPBO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 13680}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.95, "brand": "Team Marketing", "asin": "B00008EY60", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510370Y4VYL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Radio"}

{"description": "Carmela to Tony: \"Everything comes to an end.\" True enough, Mrs. Sope, but onThe Sopranos, the end comes sooner for some than others. Though for some the widely debated fourth season contained too much yakking instead of whacking, and an emphasis on domestic family over business Family, what critic James Agee once said of the Marx Brothers applies toThe Sopranos: \"The worst thing they might ever make would be better worth seeing than most other things I can think of.\" And in most respects,The Sopranosremains television's gold standard. The fourth season garnered 13 Emmy nominations, and subsequent best actor and actress wins for James Gandolfini and Edie Falco as Tony and Carmela, whose estrangement provides the season with its most powerful drama, as well as a win for Joe Pantoliano's psychopath Ralph. The season finale, \"Whitecaps,\" was a long-time-coming episode, in which Carmela at last stands up to \"toxic\" Tony, and \"Whoever Did This\" was the season's--and one of the series'--most shocking episodes.Other narrative threads include Christopher's (Emmy nominee Michael Imperioli) descent into heroin addiction, Uncle Junior's (Dominic Chianese) trial, an unrequited and potentially fatal attraction between Carmela and Tony's driver Furio, and a rude joke about Johnny Sack's wife that has potentially fatal implications. Other indelible moments include Christopher's girlfriend Adriana's projectile reaction to discovering that her new best friend is an undercover FBI agent in the episode \"No Show,\" Janice giving Ralph a shove out of their relationship in \"Christopher,\" and the classic \"Quasimodo/Nostradamus\" exchange in the season-opener, which garnered HBO's highest ratings to date. Freed from the understandably high expectations for the fourth season, heightened by the 16-month hiatus, these episodes can be better appreciated on their own considerable merits. They are pivotal chapters in television's most novel saga.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0007YMVWO", "B000067S1G", "B000BO7DWI", "B00005NOHO", "B000NA1VI2", "B00003CXOP", "B00BI9WT92", "B000V5A4DM", "B000L43AMU", "B0028RXXFM", "B00BI9VRYK", "B00003A9MG", "B001OQCVFG", "0783149956", "0446530573", "B002ZCY8CC", "B00031TYBC", "B000EULSR0", "B0024FAR5M", "B0006IUD9Y", "B000C20VPA", "B0000Y40PW", "B000067S1H", "B0009GV9E6", "B009LDD54K", "B00004XPPB", "B000E6EK42", "B00BUUAV08", "B00BC5I6Q2", "B000FTCLSU", "B00EEDNR9A", "B000NVI2GU", "B008LCRA7K", "B0060MYKYY", "B00005NOHP", "B0007QS324", "B0018CMJSU", "B00005AR37", "B003L77GS8", "B000NA1W3Q", "B001RTSPVY", "B0058YPG1G", "B003L77GK6", "B0032UYFA6", "B000MLWQ68", "B005LAJ1H2", "B000QXDJLI", "B002BWOYKC", "B000RC2ES2", "B001AQO3V0", "B0011UO91E", "B0002WZTLQ", "B009G5C8Q4", "B00009W5CA", "B005FISBTO", "B002N5N5QQ", "B0024EWP6W", "B001DJLCRC", "B008LCRA98", "B009TE9HAW", "B001GCUER0", "B006MFQ4DE", "B00B52F278", "B006TTC5HC", "B00005MEOU", "B007A2Z3Y4", "B00HUCF420", "B0060MYM3S", "B00GWJIDFW", "B0072OFM28", "B00B5J6A7W", "B008LCRAFC", "B00000FBH2", "B000V86OKG", "B009LDD3RO", "B000BNTM46", "B002LITH76", "B00066FBQG", "B00FM4S8H6", "B009TE9GNK", "B0015ABRE2", "B00005Y6YJ", "B008CLI4N4", "B00FEP9MYG", "B00CG4XKNM", "B00FZ4KR4U", "B00DJYJRHG", "B00C8CQRQ4", "B00EAPC860", "B000RETOGU", "B00J5LXT44", "B00EIXWW2O", "0307475530", "B000NTPDSW", "B00ECGHM5O", "B00915G6R6", "B00E3V9N1E", "B00HOGBXS6"], "bought_together": ["B0007YMVWO", "B000067S1G"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000067S1G", "B0007YMVWO", "B00003CXOP", "B00005NOHO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 6545}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 22.99, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00008PW1F", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51gJfq4rYEL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Sopranos: Season 4"}

{"description": "Jack Bauer is having another one of his \"very bad days\" in the second season of the groundbreaking real-time thriller24. Once again the hours are ticking by with more guaranteed cliffhangers than a convention of mountain climbers. Holed up in a Los Angeles condo and estranged from his daughter, Jack is no longer on the government payroll; unfortunately for him, this small fact doesn't seem to matter to President David Palmer and the NSA, who call him back in to the CTU and give him 24 hours to infiltrate a terrorist organization that is planning to detonate a dirty bomb in the city of angels. All Jack wants is to get his daughter out of the city, unfortunately Kim's new employer, the abusive father of the child she is nannying, has other ideas.Fans of theoriginalwon't be disappointed, as there are more than enough shock moments in the first few hours to hint at the climactic build-up to come, while newcomers can quickly get involved in the lives of Jack and his family. There are some new characters to bolster the veteran cast and, interestingly (although not surprisingly), Jack's character has taken an altogether darker, more psychopathic turn. The danger the characters find themselves in also has a much more global, not to mention topical, impetus, grounded as it is in the war against terrorism.  Although the territory is more familiar this time around, this second season is just as much a high-tension, taut, adrenalin-fuelled ride as the first, and one that will have you glued to your TV for the next 24 hours.--Kristen Bowditch", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0002XVQSU", "B000NDEXK2", "B000B837XI", "B000ICLRKC", "B000NDEXKW", "B000MR8W92", "B001L5SRJE", "B002ZCY7SW", "B001DMVZOE", "B0015QWZ8S", "B002ZCY7TG", "0756632277", "B0001WHXM0", "B00G4RCXPI", "B00KPP6ZLS", "B0000DIJNU", "B000FIMG68", "B000AJJNFE", "B00005JNOG", "B00BC5I6Q2", "B001OQCVFG", "B002N5N5QQ", "B00HT850YW", "B003FSTN52", "B000Q6GUW0", "B0049P1VHS", "B00ECHBSP8", "B004UXVDJA", "B0058YPJ2W", "B00J5LXT44", "B0044E9JU0", "B001GCUER0", "B00IWTVDUW", "B002ZCY8CC", "B0058YPGSY", "B0019L21GA", "B003L77GK6", "B00GTZWZH6", "B00HEPE6MM", "B0024FAR5M", "B00KPP6R9S", "B00005JOC9", "B004EXWGHY", "B00AIBZMD6", "B009LDD1H6", "B000P6YNSE", "B000EWBNMI", "B00ITAQ2T6", "B001AI776G", "B0036EH3XE", "B0089AD8IO", "B000YABIQ6", "B00FGEO9NE", "B00HLTD3ZW", "B009LDCZ7I", "B00IKM5LXG", "B000HEVZ9E", "B003F3NDWG", "B00AB65RUG", "B00HF98SJY", "B000BF0C8E", "B000BGR1B4", "B00E8OMZGG", "B00JA3RVG4"], "bought_together": ["B000NDEXK2", "B0002XVQSU"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000NDEXK2", "B000ICLRKC", "B0002XVQSU", "B000MR8W92"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 4639}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 39.69, "brand": "20th Century Fox", "asin": "B00008YGRU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516918NBNNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "24: Season 2"}

They return as ghosts with a mandate to  liven up the straight-laced hen-pecked life of bank president Cosmo Topper  (Roland Young), who's hungry for just such a shake-up. Before long he's  boozing, dancing, and getting into fights, all of which gives him a rakish  reputation--much to the consternation of his wife (Billie Burke, best  known as Glinda the Good Witch inThe Wizard of Oz). The sequel  replaces Grant and Bennett with Joan Blondell, who can't quite compare,  but she's charming in her own way.Topper Returnsis a rambunctious  murder mystery with some gorgeous sets and elegant cinematography--the  sequence of Blondell's death and ghostly rise is dazzling.--Bret  Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00CF3MOSQ", "B000E0ODKY", "B0044M2OMM", "B0044LYRL4", "B000059ZTM", "B0045HCJHG", "B0000549B0", "B004GJYR7I", "B000HA4WS4", "B001BSBBDK", "B00AEFY8ZE", "B00DZP1BVO", "B000083C6R", "B0090XK9FO", "B008D1Q1VU", "B00C3ALLFS", "0767821556", "B00005R87L", "B00347AIMG", "B0000C8AU6", "B002BZX0JK", "B000KX0IOU", "B000A8AX6I", "B0045HCJQW", "B0000DD77V", "B000KIX8VK", "B00000JRW5", "B00E3HUVWI", "B000ION7AI", "B003MJZ07E", "B0009HLD3C", "B000TGKWPS", "B00CZ7AL32", "B0001WTWS8", "B002EAYDWK", "B000083C8K", "B0000DD77W", "B001D8W7EK", "B0001WTWVU", "B000CEV3L4", "B0045HCJ9E", "B00008MTYC", "B001KXZGNW", "B00AATV046", "B005F265CU", "B000085EFE", "B000CC1TNI", "B00B4NLCEU", "B0001WTWRY", "B002C4N9BE", "B0024FAG1C", "B00AEBB97S", "B001GUYAZY", "B004K4FUT8", "B00AEBB9YQ", "B0012GVMIA", "B0024FAG1M", "B00A1AU6ZI", "B0001JXP2A", "B002GSXKQA", "B000054OT4", "B004193UCQ", "B00IF0KAYS", "B002EAYE7Y", "B0009X75WE", "B0012GVMI0", "B00005UMF5", "B0012GVMIK", "B0090XPGUM", "B0058K5SD6", "B00DZP1C9K", "B0006H32DY", "B000067IVZ", "B002EAYDTS", "B001GLX6US", "B00049QQJQ", "B0047BXR1C", "B0000DD780", "B000JJSJPK", "B00871C09S", "B000E6ESWG", "B000FZETR0", "B005DDN51A", "B001GLX6UI", "B000EU1Q1S", "B0009S4IJW", "B0002XNT08", "B0008ENIDO", "B00003L9CI", "B000BYA4H4", "B00007GZR1", "B0001OGW0W", "B00FEFOK4I", "B00011D1OU", "B000SUHOEW", "B00406UJZG", "B00009IB1F", "B00000C0QO", "B003ZW9H68", "B002945DUM"], "bought_together": ["B00CF3MOSQ", "B000E0ODKY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001BSBBDK", "B000E0ODKY", "B004GJYR7I", "B0045HCJHG"]}, "price": 9.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 11164}, "asin": "B00008ZZ7B", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51VSVyS5tpL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Topper / Topper Returns ( Double Feature) (1941)"}
{"description": "With its subtle mixture of wartime hardship, comedic interludes, and a hallucinatory hint of Italian magic realism,The Night of the Shooting Starswas named the best film of 1982 by the prestigious National Society of Film Critics. Drawing inspiration from their own experiences in Nazi-occupied Italy, the codirecting Taviani brothers (Paolo and Vittorio) remade this feature from their 1954 debut short \"San Miniato, July 1944,\" framing its touching yet occasionally vague tale of wartime survival as a bedtime story, told by a loving mother from her memories as a 6-year-old, fleeing her Tuscan village in the closing days of World War II. American liberation is promised within days, but the Nazis have rigged village houses with mines, so the residents of San Martino flee to the countryside, where encounters with fascists are common and deadly. The film's dreamy nostalgia isn't as satisfying as, say,Cinema Paradiso, but it's still a lovely film, filled with quintessentially Italian vitality while proving, as one character observes, that \"even true stories can end well.\"--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00124SNIO", "B00124SNIY", "B000NHG81A", "B000I0RNV6", "B004P0IRHE", "B00598OA2C", "B00HRJVHEK", "B003U4H0CE", "B0018O50VG", "B002U6DVQ2", "B00HUAH14Q", "B006LAB8RW", "B0009P7EI2", "B00HVOFP9O", "084252455X", "B0007M222A", "B00HE010QM", "B000FUF7D0", "B004M66YUS", "B0000DZ3BJ", "6305081034", "B004R4PWYY", "B00003CXXY", "B000C1VB8M", "B000053VBP", "B00128R94Y", "B005GP7F5W", "B006MHZ32K", "B00AIBZLHS", "B007AFBYTO", "B003JHXS8C", "B00005U1YR", "B00009Y3PM", "B004D45NZG", "B000I8OOG0", "B004SIP8W0", "B001NH4CIA", "B000067IXK", "B001LMU1C8", "B0009S4IJW", "B000BITUIO", "B000B8384Q", "B000063K2Q", "B005HISOJ4", "B00005BCJZ", "B000CR8QV6", "B0036TGSJE", "B007UI0CIA", "B004XVMCLW", "B004ODLUIU", "B00CUKTH34", "B00DHN8G58", "B000E3L7L4", "B000E3L7M8", "B006MHZ46A", "B003IISTD6", "B002AG2NTI", "B004C2523M", "B000E33W0I", "B0009X7682", "B000CNE088", "B0007ZEO8C", "B005GRF2XM", "B000PFT1KA", "B004KDYR2A", "B008Y5OXB0", "B00F6SHGF8", "B000V6FVMK", "B00GSBMNOQ", "B00G15MDI0", "B008H1Q3QY", "B001BEK8BK", "B007WXUVHU", "B000WC38IC", "B000RHRGSK", "B00AEFXV3E", "B0000C23T0", "B00005Y6XU", "B00ARX2VZW", "B0018BD9DA", "B00008LDNZ", "B008YAPRPG", "B0001Y4LD2", "0767802470", "0521649773", "B001PYZA78", "B003RSI63K", "B000HXZ94C"], "bought_together": ["B00124SNIO", "B00124SNIY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00124SNIO", "B0087IT8FK", "B00124SNIY", "B00598OA2C"]}, "price": 42.9, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 175738}, "asin": "B00008ZZ9K", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51K1H0DEA0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Night of the Shooting Stars"}

{"description": "When newly-commissioned SS Lieutenant Kurt Gerstein (Ulrich Tukur) witnesses the chemical disinfectant he's helped perfect being used to systematically murder interred Jews, he has no choice but to act. The only sympathetic ear Gerstein is able to find is that of a young Father Riccardo (Amelie's Mathieu Kassovitz), a priest with deep ties to the Vatican. While Riccardo takes on the obstructive Vatican hierarchy, Gerstein must walk a tightrope between documenting and enabling the atrocities his fellow SS officers cold-bloodedly commit. As the two unlikely allies fight to reveal the truth to the Church and the world, they discover that the fates of a man of conscience committing treason for the sake of humanity and a man of God committing heresy to thwart genocide are ultimately the same.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000087EYX", "B002IVDLH8", "B000PMGS7C", "B00005QAQI", "B00008RV0G", "B00005BJWC", "B00005YUO1", "B0070KCJLQ", "B0001DMW9S", "B00IKM5OTW", "B00JPJC8RK", "B00D3XM7H0", "B00049QJ9I", "B00IS6WPXS", "B00FL2EWYM", "B004EI2NWM", "B001UFE8PM", "B00ID8H8EW", "B004KL0OVU", "B000H5V8H2", "B00J0IN6Z4", "B00JEEZSUA", "B0000BWVCR", "B000KB48NE", "B00HLTD3ZW", "B00D3XMA9A", "B00007KQ9X", "B0047UJBJA", "B0002CX1NY", "B000FDFSYA", "B00HV2BG44", "B007UI0CIA", "B0012QE4PI", "B000YKT4BW", "B00EO2I6XS", "B0030ZIZTK", "B00H96KFV2", "B009XTF8NI", "B00JJRLFTU", "B00DPUB5LK", "B000TGCR38", "B002KECJZ8", "B00JVQ7PWU", "B00018D4PO", "B00DL48BM6", "B0036TGSV2", "B00JJRLFVS", "B00007ELEV", "B00C2535TE", "B00I116MZ2", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B003JLL2RW", "B000FVQLRA", "B00097DY66", "B00BC1UPRO", "B002WBYDR6", "B00005AUJR", "B005OTGS4E", "B00IVLR9JA", "B000093NQZ", "B00INB7UO2", "B00J5LXMTG", "B00IAR2CFG", "B00J2PQZBC", "B000AQ69R2", "B00H0EN948", "B004H9ZQ4K", "B00ID8HATK", "B00KDK64DY", "B00BWH6DK6", "B0055UBGEO", "B00006IUHK", "B003PMWF62", "B000OVLBGC", "B005HQBO9I", "B009XTF8MY", "B003K1H14E", "B0007R4SYU", "B00005JMLR", "B000TLTCPO", "B00G15MDI0", "B0049TC8CQ", "B002QP145C", "B0007ZEOPK", "B002Q5O6Y8", "B00AEFXRRO", "B000NA6CQ8", "B003YKYX7Y", "0375414347", "B005DKS1TE", "B00ENMZK1A", "B0041KKZIM", "B000HC2PLS", "B00IVLR9LI", "B002TQKL66", "B0002CR04A", "B002BWP4A6", "B002ID09BM"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AIBZMD6", "B00JEEZSUA", "B00HLTD3ZW", "B003AWRMBU"]}, "price": 19.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 200647}, "asin": "B00009W0W4", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51924YKWW5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Amen"}

{"description": "Harrison Ford lends his solid, perpetually disgruntled presence toHollywood Homicide, an action comedy in which he's paired with the squinty eyes and peaches-and-cream complexion of Josh Hartnett (Black Hawk Down,O). Radical French filmmaker Jean-Luc Godard would appreciate this complete deconstruction of the buddy-cop flick genre; basic cinematic elements (mismatched partners, a hard-ass superior riding them, arguments about who's going to drive, arguments about intuition vs. diligent detective work, the bad cop who killed Hartnett's father, etc.) have been scrambled and slapped together with no concern for coherence, making clear their innately artificial nature. Sex scenes and car chases come out of nowhere and disappear without consequence, providing arbitrary visual stimulus. During shootouts, it's impossible to tell who got killed or why, underscoring a basic doubt about the purpose of making movies likeHollywood Homicide.

{"description": "The third time's the, for want of a better word, charm forSouth Parkon DVD. Instead of mere episode intros as on the first two boxed sets, Trey Parker and Matt Stone finally oblige us with actual episode commentary, or, as they call it, \"commentary-mini.\" On this optional audio track, Trey and Matt goof for about five minutes or so at the top of each episode, certifying some as favorites (\"Tweek vs. Craig,\" \"Jewbilee,\" and \"Worldwide Recorder Concert,\" which is described as \"a reverse after-school special from hell\"), championing others popularly dismissed bySouth Park's otherwise loyal fans (\"Jakovasaurs,\" \"Sexual Harassment Panda\"), and provocatively dismissing all ofseason 2.The third season was frantically produced simultaneously with the feature film,South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut. This was the season, Trey proclaims, \"whereSouth Parkturned the corner... and became good (as far as we were concerned).\" Among their most inspired conceits is the so-called \"Meteor Shower Party\" trilogy, three episodes that unfold over the course of one night, each focusing on a different kid. \"Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery\" pays homage to Hanna-Barbera-style animation andScooby-Doo, recasting Korn as the Mystery Inc gang. \"Rainforest Shmainforest,\" featuring a game Jennifer Aniston, cuts rainforest crusaders down to size. \"Mr. Hankey's Christmas Classics\" takes its irreverent cue from thealbum of the same name, and contains an outrageously obscure reference to the 1978 made-for-TVStar Wars Holiday Special. Throughout the season,South Parkis, as usual, a gleeful equal-opportunity offender, but the show's true gonzo spirit is truly illustrated in such surreal touches as the employment of live action in \"Tweek vs. Craig,\" the singing of \"The Morning After\" backwards to save Chef from the spell of \"The Succubus,\" and theSeinfeld-worthy argument over whether the term should be \"pirate ghosts\" or \"ghost pirates\" in \"Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery.\"--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00023P49M", "B0001ZWLVU", "B00023P49C", "B0006Z2L2Y", "B000ADWCYY", "B000CNESM6", "B000FSME2Y", "B000KLQUMQ", "B000R7I3XC", "B0018O5WUU", "B001O0TWXG", "B0030Y11UG", "B004MLEYTG", "B006W93ELK", "B009SQ9Q5M", "B000USUA8E", "B000022TSW", "B000LW7OKQ", "B00AEBB8TM", "B001O0TWXQ", "B000ZT0S9O", "B00105308I", "B006W93EM4", "B0030Y11NS", "B004MLEYT6", "B009SQ9Y7M", "B000OPO0LQ", "B008412UKA", "B00008YGRV", "B0000AQS81", "B000AQ68Z0", "B0012018OE", "B000E6ES9O", "B003VJTGKW", "B000083C6V", "B003DZX46G", "B0001MZ7KA", "B000HT3P6U", "B000RO6JZO", "0762435615", "B001CQONKO", "B009WSJHD2", "B000UAE7UE", "B00G4RCB14", "B001VFM0ZG", "B006IOAHTQ", "B0002XVQT4", "B000E0OE3K", "B000NNK4DM", "B00008YGRS", "B007ZFR67I", "B003L77G7Y", "B0007PAM06", "B000P2A6CA", "B007KFZ8AA", "B00G4RCF60", "B000067DNE", "B00LBHOCHS", "B000B5XOR0", "6305301700", "B007KFZ7YM", "B00CJEKA2I", "B0002WZRSG", "030789682X", "B00008YGRZ", "B000F9T700", "B003W5TO70", "B00005JM3G", "B001RIZ7OI", "B007KFZ85K", "B003CN5B7E", "B001G0MFFG", "B00C28X8IY", "B00000J8BV", "B0002NY8XA", "B007KFZ88M", "B00AEFZ8OY", "B0012KSUTA", "B00002RAO2", "B00330WP6Q", "B000ABKHZC", "B008412UQ4", "B00CJEK7GW", "B007Z3UUF0", "B00E0FW054", "B000GPYMZS", "B006IOAHPK", "B003XJABTK", "B007KFZ7UQ", "B003V3FVQ6", "B004QP7WTC", "B0001LJBTE", "B0007CILMA", "B00K8HAJN8", "B000B5XOWU", "0762435704", "B00003CXS7", "B00H3JJCW8", "B001MT7ZI8"], "bought_together": ["B00023P49M", "B00023P49C"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00023P49M", "B00023P49C", "B0006Z2L2Y", "B0001ZWLVU"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 16296}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 14.12, "brand": "Paramount", "asin": "B0000CABL2", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51rGlTEGXrL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "South Park: Season 3"}

{"description": "Riding high on the phenomenal success ofA Rush of Blood to the Head, Coldplay is in peak form onColdplay Live 2003. This CD/DVD two-pack was filmed (on Super-16mm film) and recorded in Sydney's Horden Pavilion on July 21 and 22, 2003, during an exhaustive year-long world tour, and the medium-sized arena provides a fitting stage for the London-based rock quartet, not so grand as to overwhelm the music, but large enough to indicate their large and loyal following, which includes enthusiastic fans of either gender. Especially when played in DTS 5.1 surround, this 90-minute concert is richer, thicker, and (of course) louder than Coldplay's studio recordings, lending a wall-of-sound expansiveness to the band's signature sound, which draws from such diverse influences as Genesis, Pink Floyd, The Verve, U2, and their own unique sonic landscape. \"Politik\" gets the gig off to a rousing start, and other impressive highlights include \"Daylight,\" \"Yellow,\" the as-yet-unreleased new song \"Moses,\" and the popular hits \"In My Place,\" \"Clocks,\" and \"The Scientist.\" And while the concert visuals are slick and professional (perhaps placing a bit too much emphasis on singer/frontman Chris Martin), this DVD and CD--the latter containing a truncated 70-minute version of the same performance--are best appreciated for their pristine audio quality. Culled from 400 hours of home video, the 40-minute \"concert diary\" represents a wasted opportunity, enjoyable for hardcore fans but offering no insight into the band or its individual members. Much better, then, to play the concert at healthy high volume, and appreciate Coldplay in the prime of their young career.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B009A9BEHU", "B009A9BF5G", "B006FVZJ4U", "B009TO99TG", "B0053YGYO4", "B002A6G010", "B00IQE4NUK", "B0000UQQTE", "B0000DJZ95", "B0000508U6", "B009611ZPI", "B000RPTQ1C", "B000069AUI", "B001H9MWW2", "B000BNXDE6", "B0006L16N8", "B009S0VG42", "B0019HQIGS", "B0000TB05A", "B000BHHVPO", "B001HDO4Z6", "B005Y423ZC", "B003ELOQCK", "B00006LVGB", "B002KD0OSI", "B0000E2FLC", "B002RBZ13Q", "B00005R23S", "B002UD7E6I", "B003ELOQD4", "B000083C7X", "B005IS5130", "B0000DZEE3", "B00005RD3W", "B00JFBCDD2", "B000HEZC7K", "B007OCD1OE", "B0001XAPPQ", "B002MZZSY4", "B00008PX8P", "B008UFZCJ6", "B000AANBG0", "B000654YRY", "B009DT9ANW", "B0000TG9V0", "B000BNXDEQ", "B0000DJZB9", "B002SQFZ68", "B00884S0UC", "B0000TGADW", "B003ICWTTM", "B00009P1O2", "B00FWSWQX4", "B006OTN3DW", "B001HY3BNQ", "B00005RFTS", "B004AGDJIA", "B004J88SGC", "B00002ZMNV", "B000T4SWXO", "B001F9FHF8", "B00E6F155E", "B00AB2NYM8", "0711996067", "B0019HQIFE", "B0000DJZAX", "B000UVV2DI", "1573300934", "B0000UX57K", "B00023P4B0", "B0006M83II", "B00G6MW68K", "0711989249", "B0006A9IAM", "B000SQL4ZQ", "B00005NFZQ", "B000N3SOSY", "B00005RT2S", "B000GIWHCU", "B000Y7ZHCU", "B002Q4TKAO", "B007NZDES0", "B00005RFBA", "B000F8O49A", "B000067IX3", "B000BRBAOC", "B000056HOZ", "B007OCD1MQ", "B000BTC5LW", "B002KD3Q8I", "B0000A4G42", "B000I5XD1U", "B0001ENXYA", "B005Z271Y6", "B005SD25WA", "B00000DFUB", "B001HQ6ZC8", "B0001JXOOO", "B000096I9G", "B00005QBZD"], "bought_together": ["B009A9BEHU", "B0053YGYO4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B009S0VG42", "B00IQE4NUK", "B009TO99TG", "B0000508U6"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 72214}, "categories": [["CDs & Vinyl", "Alternative Rock", "American Alternative"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Alternative Rock", "British Alternative", "Britpop"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Alternative Rock", "Indie & Lo-Fi", "Dream Pop"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Alternative Rock", "Indie & Lo-Fi", "Indie Rock"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Pop", "Vocal Pop"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Rock"], ["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 34.99, "brand": "EMD", "asin": "B0000DJZ9T", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4133G83XRYL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Coldplay - Live 2003 (DVD &amp; CD)"}

There's no Bay commentary track as he did for theoriginal film, but he does appear in the disc 2 featurettes on stunts and visual effects describing the use of real props (check out the \"car flipper\" apparatus), CGI, and camera positioning (\"The theory of this car chase is to put cameras where cameramen would be killed doing these shots.\").Also filling out disc 2 are the in-depth scene deconstructions, which take six key scenes and allow you to view the sequence as it appeared in the film (a convenient touch), watch on-set footage, see the storyboards, and read the script (yes, there was a script).  The 19 \"production diaries\" may sound like text notes, but they offer even more on-set footage and factoids.  The seven deleted scenes are all pretty short and none aren't watchable, but it's hard to imagine needing to add any extra time to this 147-minute film.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00004STUL", "B00164GDE6", "B00003CY5Y", "6304821832", "B000OT6V64", "0780631234", "B00005U5A8", "B000J4QWMC", "B0000A2ZU1", "B0000VAFO0", "B002CA68N4", "B00008WI9O", "B002AT8KA6", "B000WGYMTC", "B00003GPFT", "B002AS466O", "B00AEFXP8K", "B002CA68MU", "B000HDZKLO", "B00005A3KS", "B00005JLQT", "B00000G3PA", "B00005JLQN", "B000N4SHNK", "B00005JL3K", "B0049IHX2C", "B00005JMUA", "B001DJLD12", "B000085EFK", "B0045HCJG2", "B00005JLG1", "B00006RVJR", "B001KRVLCI", "0783225539", "155890834X", "B000VG66XS", "B000274T94", "B002GHHHME", "6304711891", "B000WQWPKA", "B00177YA1K", "B003ZD9E4W", "B00IKM5OYW", "B0007V6ITE", "B000WGYMT2", "B00005JKWJ", "B001CDR1FG", "B00005JKMQ", "B00026ZG10", "B0002B14UW", "B0041QSZS8", "B0015XHP2C", "B00AEFYE08", "B00003CXKD", "B000056BOW", "1558908390", "B001VLBDD0", "0790738953", "B00005JMEW", "6305428115", "B00005JPK8", "B00AEFXSEQ", "B001QB9H1U", "B00008MTYF", "B000U1ZV8K", "B004U7MR14", "0767802519", "B002NXSRVG", "B00AEFYO08", "B000069DOB", "0780627857", "B000XA5K48", "B00IS02HA0", "0790732149", "0780631684", "B00AEFY0XE", "B000F5WR4W", "B00005N5S5", "B000I2J736", "B00005JN0T", "B000VR0570", "B001OST0LW", "B00441GYXI", "B000HT38BM", "B00005JKCH", "B001OST0M6", "B00005JKCB", "B0013J55B6", "B0036BDQBU", "B000P0J06U", "B00008G8M4", "B000RW3VCK", "B00029RT9E", "B00005JM4Q", "B002VWNIEA", "0780627822", "B00005JD5H", "B002CA68NO", "B0001MMGC2", "B00003CXTA"], "bought_together": ["B00004STUL", "6304821832"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000VG66XS", "B00004STUL", "B00L4K450G", "B005LAIGRS"]}, "price": 14.94, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 69765}, "asin": "B0000DKDUR", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GXM3243YL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Bad Boys II (Two-Disc Special Edition)"}
{"description": "Like its fellow HBO seriesSex and the City, this half-hour comedy broke some TV rules and went from critics' darling to an award-winning series in three years.Curb Your Enthusiasmis the brainchild of star-creator Larry David who co-createdSeinfeldand was the basis for the easily rattled George Costanza (who was played by Jason Alexander). Like George, David has a tendency to speak too much, blow things out of proportion, and, most often, fail in the end (and often liking it that way). David's new show is also like its predecessor: it's about \"nothing\" except following the day-to-day ramblings of a sometime writer and comic (this time in L.A.). Eternal questions stemming from universal daily dilemmas are honed to perfect comedic absurdity. A notable exception is the show is only scripted by plot; much of the action is improvised. The first season starts with a one-hour mockumentary following David's return to stand-up for the first time in years; the other 10 episodes follow a more traditional sit-com setup.David plays \"himself\" (as does his friend, Richard Lewis) although his manager and wife are played by comedians Jeff Garlin and Cheryl Hines. Although this first season is a comedic gem, one can't take more than an episode or two at a time--it's acidic, biting comedy. The episodes are often built like a house of cards, which the irritable David will surely collapse by the end. Like another caustic TV character, Dabney Colman's Buffalo Bill (1983-84), Larry David is not for everybody.--Doug ThomasStills fromCurb Your Enthusiasm- The Complete First Season(Click for larger image)&nbsp;&nbsp;", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0001US8EE", "B00067BCB8", "B0009WIE34", "B000FL7CAU", "B000VXK6Z0", "B002OOWKSA", "B003L77GMO", "B00EHJC7I8", "B00005JLEX", "B002LMV7RA", "B0002UE1WQ", "B000RW3VDE", "B008BLCP0S", "B008LCRAFC", "B008LCRABQ", "B008LCRA98", "B008LCRA7K", "B00AS86VFM", "B002LMV7QG", "B0002PYS7Y", "B0007YXRCW", "B00G4RIOOW", "B0018RKEQE", "B00020X852", "B00G4RIPE6", "B0013FSL0C", "B00EIJTLK4", "B001IBIDLI", "B0002ERXC2", "B008LCRAC0", "B005SEDI5M", "B00EHJC9AE", "B003L77GJM", "1929132360", "B00BGI07NK", "B000GGSMC6", "B0008KLV96", "B000A88ESW", "B00000G02H", "B0090XPH06", "B0007QS324", "B00J5LXT44", "B003R4ZMOA", "B000CQQID0", "B0058EE6NK", "B00ICR6SBI", "B009LDCVJU", "B00EEDNR9A", "B007WGDC7I", "B003Y5HWJU", "B00EPH8S58", "B001L1S1PS", "1592402305", "B000GETTKM", "B001DJLCRC", "B00608CD3I", "B00HUCF420", "B00JAQJNN0", "B005S97V82", "B0041KKZKA", "B000A9QKRI", "B008FRJDVC", "B000EXDS7K", "B001OQCVFG", "B006CR2OOA", "B000HRMAPE", "B00BUYWJEA", "B0006FO5LO", "1592408265", "B000P0J0D8", "B000B5XOR0", "B000RBA6CO", "B00C0UO1EY", "B0033WH6MW", "B00BI7ZAM2", "B0060MYKYY", "B0009A40ES", "B00019PDNY", "B003L77G06", "B002JVWQSW", "B002OOWKSU", "B000YABIQ6", "B009DA74D4", "B005LAJ16I", "B00BC5I6Q2", "B009LDD54K", "B0092QH902", "B003ES5JH4", "B0049AF6UG", "B00FOHHMWI", "B002AMUDK8", "B0019N8P2W", "B00GV8AZRI", "B005D0OHA6", "B001RTSPVY", "B0058YPG1G", "B008CFZQQS", "B0000640VJ", "B009LDD4BO"], "bought_together": ["B0001US8EE", "B00067BCB8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00067BCB8", "B0001US8EE", "B003L77GMO", "B0009WIE34"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 14356}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 20.99, "brand": "EMI", "asin": "B0000E2PVR", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZUW6F78XL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Curb Your Enthusiasm: Season 1"}

In the wake of territorial murder, free-grazing cowboys Boss (Robert Duvall) and Charley (Costner) seek vengeful justice against the ruthless rancher (Michael Gambon) who threatens their law-abiding survival. A feisty ally (the late Michael Jeter, in his next-to-final film role) and a doctor's sister (Annette Bening) offer support during climactic shootouts, masterfully staged with the shock and suddenness of real-life gunfire.

{"description": "TheUnderworldDVD has a powerful soundtrack that makes good use of ambient noises (e.g., bullet casings pinging on the floor) and has a clear, well-defined picture, which is especially impressive considering the film's predominant look is black leather at nighttime.  The first segment of the four-part, 54-minute documentary is mostly self-congratulation and plot summary (which is not necessarily a bad thing); more interesting are the creature effects and the actors learning how to do their own stunts.  If you were wondering if the voice of the Lycan Raze was really that deep, you can listen to him--actor/co-writer Kevin Grevioux--along with director Len Wiseman and co-writer Danny McBride on the first commentary track as they discuss breaking the rulebook for vampires and shooting in Budapest on a tiny $22 million budget.  The accent-heavy technical commentary discusses how the visual effects and sound design add to the film--one of their goals was to make Kate Beckinsale look \"sexy, stylish, and subversive.\"--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000F6IOC0", "B001HN697M", "B003Y5H5EW", "B0002KVUKM", "B0002J4X1Q", "0767834739", "B001JV5B12", "B000YPUF9W", "B002ZG98UA", "B009MO57H6", "0780624890", "B001AK3S4Y", "B001GUYB08", "B0007V6ITE", "B001F7MSFM", "B000F6IOBG", "B001GCUO0W", "B000FGGE68", "B005LAIHSG", "B0002YLCG0", "B0009MDPYM", "B000AYELVA", "0800195175", "B000069I1I", "B00005JKWJ", "B008OR5X4O", "B0000AXE8I", "B002GSXKNI", "B00005JKYX", "B004EPZ07K", "B005LAIH2C", "B003Y5H5F6", "B0000DKDUR", "B003HKN52U", "B002KX9CPO", "B005CFBZWK", "B00008AOVL", "B00IKM5LXG", "B001VLFE7Q", "B004LWZW42", "B001VLFE7G", "B0001BKAEY", "B005LAIH54", "B001QOGYFO", "B00005JL78", "B0000844I8", "B001PR0Y8K", "B005G4TJUC", "B002NXSRVG", "B00005JM5E", "B00AEBBA72", "B001L9EXUC", "B0007WFX62", "B0013J55B6", "B002O3Z50Q", "B00000JQB5", "B002ZG977Y", "B00003CXTA", "B000GCFO0I", "B0000959N0", "B00AEFXCLU", "B0001O3YD0", "B001OQCV6A", "B0002ZDVEU", "B002ZG98N2", "B005LAIIPS", "B000IHY9TS", "B00005JM5B", "B004LWZWGA", "B000P0J0AQ", "B0053FANPY", "B00AEFY5B6", "B0085A9HU6", "B000CEV4XQ", "B00005RHGK", "B0000E2R6P", "B0006SSOHC", "B000OVLBHG", "B00AEFYGBA", "B002TMI2A2", "B0002VEUV2", "B009YQJ322", "B000EHRVP6", "B003ZKBELG", "B00005JNJV", "B002DKGWSE", "B000VWYJ86", "B005LAIHYU", "B00003CXSD", "B0015XHP2C", "B001GZ6QC4", "B00AZTUUQK", "B004EPYZT4", "B000TGJ80S", "B00027JZ3E", "B001GKJ2E8", "B001VLBDD0", "0767803434", "B004LWZWFQ", "B00195FUDC"], "bought_together": ["B003Y5H5EW", "B001HN697M"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003Y5H5EW", "B007WZTG1U", "B001VLFE7G", "B001HN697M"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 128315}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.94, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B0000VAFNQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/412NSB5PCYL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Underworld (Full Screen Special Edition)"}
{"description": "TheAlien Quadrilogyis a nine-disc boxed set devoted to the fourAlienfilms. Although previously available on DVD as theAlien Legacy, here they have been repackaged with vastly more extras and with upgraded sound and picture. For anyone who hasn't been in hypersleep for the last 25 years, this series needs no introduction, though for the first time each film now comes in both original and \"special edition\" form.Alien(1979) was so perfect it didn't need fixing, and Ridley Scott's 2003 director's cut is fiddling for the sake of fiddling. Watch it once, then return to the majestic, perfectly paced original. Conversely, the special edition of James Cameron'sAliens(1986) is the definitive version, though it's nice to finally have the theatrical cut on DVD for comparison. Most interesting is the alternativeAlien 3(1992). This isn't a \"director's cut\"--David Fincher refused to have any involvement with this release--but a 1991 work-print that runs 29 minutes longer than the theatrical version, and has now been restored, remastered, and finished off with (unfortunately) cheap new CGI. Still, it's truly fascinating, offering a different insight into a flawed masterpiece. The expanded opening is visually breathtaking, the central firestorm is much longer, and a subplot involving Paul McGann's character adds considerable depth to story. The ending is also subtly but significantly different.Alien: Resurrection(1997) always was a mess with a handful of brilliant scenes, and the special edition just makes it eight minutes longer.TheAlien Quadrilogyoffers the first and fourth films with DTS soundtracks, the others having still fine Dolby Digital 5.1 presentation. All four films sound fantastic, with much low-level detail revealed for the first time. Each is anamorphically enhanced at the correct original aspect ratio, and the prints and transfers are superlative. Every film offers a commentary track that lends insight into the creative process--though the Scott-only commentary and isolated music score from the firstAlienDVD release are missing here.Each movie is complemented by a separate disc packed with hours of seriously detailed documentaries (all presented in full-screen with clips letterboxed), thousands of photos, production stills, and storyboards, giving a level of inside information for the dedicated buff only surpassed by theLord of the Ringsextended DVD sets. A ninth DVD compiles miscellaneous material, including an hourlong documentary and even all the extras from the oldAlienlaserdisc. \"Exhaustive\" hardly beings to describe theAlien Quadrilogy, a set that establishes the new DVD benchmark for retrospective releases and looks unlikely to be surpassed for some time.--Gary S.

{"description": "Partly inspired by 1948'sThe Big Clockand its nominal 1987 remakeNo Way Out, the Denzel Washington thrillerOut of Timeis quite enjoyable if you ignore its implausible plotting. Like those earlier films, this reunion of Washington and hisDevil in a Blue Dressdirector Carl Franklin is about a man--in this case the police chief (Washington) of sleepy Banyan Key, Florida--who falls into a trap set by others, sinks into legal quicksand of his own making, and must race the clock to extricate himself from a series of incriminating setbacks. The Florida setting adds welcome character to the potboiler plot, and Washington's screen-cred makes it easy to overlook the absurdities of rookie writer David Collard's screenplay. Eva Mendes is sharp and sensible as Washington's estranged wife (do you think they'll reconcile for a happy ending?), and the talented John Billingsley--whose portrayal of \"Dr. Phlox\" on TV'sEnterpriseis vastly underrated--is a constant delight as Washington's medical examiner, beer buddy and wily co-conspirator. It's hardly a classic, butOut of Timegoes well with a big tub of popcorn.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JPD0", "B000GFLKF8", "B00005JN0W", "B000244GCC", "B002LMV7R0", "6304884400", "B002VWNIEA", "B00005JKWX", "B000OT6V0K", "B005LAIGRS", "0783240295", "B0050MB4OO", "6304765258", "B00BTYOYG2", "B002ZG99TA", "B00005JA9F", "B0006210ZG", "B0000542CJ", "078324228X", "0767818075", "B002CPMB9O", "B002ZG997C", "B00AFEXRME", "B00441GZ1Y", "B002GHHHN8", "B00096S49Y", "B000N60HAO", "B00BEIYN9Q", "B005LAIGLE", "B002AT8K9W", "B00005JLRZ", "B00125WAWS", "B003BV8I3Q", "B0001VTPUO", "B008E70EES", "B0013J55B6", "B0007KZQAM", "B001JV5AZE", "B002O3Z4WK", "0800141806", "B000F8DV1M", "B002NZK5UU", "B00AEFXT1S", "B002AT8KAG", "B00BB67UNW", "B00J5G1P2W", "B002DU39GW", "B000G5SILC", "B00441GYXI", "0767810872", "B000ZS8GWQ", "B008FCX2D2", "B00AEBB86A", "B00008EYA5", "B00DZP1C2W", "B001UV4XRY", "0790730979", "6305428115", "0790736411", "6305161933", "B0006GAI5U", "B00BEIYHO2", "B008B9JTLI", "0783229402", "B001KRVLCI", "B003L20IG0", "B008JFUNKU", "B00AEBB8LA", "B00JA3RVG4", "B000VG66XS", "B0006GANOQ", "B00009L1TA", "B000R4SMCW", "B005OK721G", "B000EGDB10", "B00HEPC0TS", "B001L57ZYM", "B000069HZP", "B000P0J0EM", "B00007AJG1", "B00015YVDG", "6305505802", "B00005JMWP", "B004EPYZP8", "B00AEFXX9Q", "B000RO9Q7W", "B000244GCW", "B007EQR0D8", "B00J2MPZQG", "B00005JN0T", "B000QXDCLU", "B000P0I4O4", "B00005JNQA", "B005FUTBWS", "B00005JKQS", "0790742004", "B005YFGJFG", "B0002J4X2K", "B000N3SRO0", "B00013RC66"], "bought_together": ["B00005JPD0", "B00005JN0W"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005JN0W", "B00005JKWX", "B00005JPD0", "B000GFLKF8"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 29468}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.98, "brand": "Mgm/Ua Studios", "asin": "B0000VJG72", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51bhUc7kE0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Out of Time"}

{"description": "Romantic Teen Comedy. In this modern update of the classic 1987 teen comedy Can't Buy Me Love, our hero is high-school senior Alvin Johnson (Nick Cannon), a brilliant, likable outcast who has come to regret the years of intellectual endeavors that prevented him and his un-hip friends from socializing, getting girlfriends and hanging out with the super-cool \"Elite\" kids. When queen of the Elites, Paris Morgan (Christina Milian) wrecks her mother's car, Alvin steps in and mortgages his future to help her out. The catch: In exchange for $1500 in car parts and Alvin's automotive expertise, Paris agrees to \"fake a front\" with him to convince the school that they're dating. The question is: can Alvin rein in his newfound ego before he loses his true friends, his chance for a scholarship and a shot at a real relationship with Paris?DVD Features:Additional ScenesAlternate endings:Paris takes center stage in a surprise alternate endingDocumentary:Marvelous making-of documentaryMusic Video:2 Music Videos: \"Shorty (Put it on the Floor)\" by platinum selling rap stars Busta Rhymes, Chingy, Fat Joe and film star Nick Cannon \"Luv Me Baby\" by Murphy LeeTheatrical Trailer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000FS9ULC", "B0001MMGC2", "B00005JPK8", "B000XSWVEC", "B0034G4P1C", "B000BTITFI", "B0002B14UW", "B00004Y2R1", "B0001CNRS4", "B00AMEZDJW", "B00003CY51", "B00BTYPWDQ", "6305505780", "0780627822", "B000HDZKLO", "B000093I8L", "B00E1HIXA2", "B000BVM1WI", "B00AEFYE08", "B00177YFYM", "B002CAWNEM", "B00005RIX5", "B000LRZHR8", "B00E1HIX66", "B0007N1A36", "B0000TWMTS", "B00005JLON", "6304821832", "B005LAIH86", "B00066FAQW", "B001DJLD12", "B00005LB86", "B002VWNICM", "B00000JGHV", "B000BITV9W", "B000069DOB", "B002CA68NO", "B002GSXKOM", "B000YAF4Q6", "B00DW5IL2E", "B00AEFXOKO", "B00AEFXY6I", "B000XT1P20", "B00007BK2S", "B00008977B", "B0041QSZS8", "0783240201", "B00005TNER", "B0006QAIG4", "B000TLOMPE", "0767821955", "B0009RCPUW", "630592273X", "1558908390", "B00006LPH6", "B0021L8V2A", "B0002J4YVK", "B00007ELEO", "B003UEYBPI", "B000FUTVLY", "B000035P5I", "B00BLN4V46", "B00006HAYO", "B00005JKWM", "B00000JGHO", "B002GSXKO2", "B000J3OTSM", "6305428409", "B000IFRT4W", "B002DOBGWM", "B004P7CMZ0", "B000065V3H", "B000JJSL1W", "B0000AGQ6T", "B00GOZ2LPM", "B000PE0GRI", "B000E5N68E", "B004WJT5E2", "B001CIOCOY", "B002FOFX9M", "B0009P42RS", "B001JV5AZE", "B002TZS5QU", "B00005U156", "B004SIP93S", "B001TUZGPO", "B00066FAVW", "B0068FYZES", "B002GHHK3U", "B005DEUEYA", "B004SIP9X8", "B000XT1P52", "B00006SFL7", "B00003CXKD", "B00AEFYQWO", "B000AM4P9K", "B000803BQC", "B00AEFYAC0", "B00066FAC6", "B00005JLG1"], "bought_together": ["B00004Y2R1"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00004Y2R1", "B00AMEZDJW", "B0002B14UW", "B000RETOHO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 164741}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.94, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B0001FR3HM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51YQEJ822HL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Love Don't Cost a Thing (Full Screen Edition)"}

{"description": "From a human standpoint, things are pretty tight at the 4077th. But adding a new character to a long-embedded, close-knit ensemble is a delicate operation. ByM*A*S*H's sixth season, Hawkeye (Alan Alda) and BJ (Mike Farrell) were partners in outrage against the war and army bureaucracy. With the departure of Larry Linville's Frank Burns, the much decorated series was in need of some new blood. Enter David Ogden Stiers as Charles Emerson Winchester III. Just as Henry Morgan's authoritative Col. Potter was the anti-Henry Blake, so was Charles just what the doctor ordered to give Hawkeye and BJ a worthy foil. Charles was pompous and arrogant, but, unlike Frank, he was Hawkeye's equal in the operating room. And he gave as good as was given to him, as witness the conclusion of his inaugural Emmy-nominated episode, \"Fade Out, Fade In,\" in which he turns the tables on one of Hawkeye and BJ's reptilian practical jokes. In season 6, Gary Burghoff's Radar is mostly missing in action (he would transfer out of the series in season 8), but he figures prominently in \"Fallen Idol,\" one of Burghoff's and Alda's finest half-hours, in which Hawkeye lashes out at Radar's \"Iowa naivete\" and hero worship.The season's primary dramatic arc is Margaret's (Loretta Switt) marital woes, culminating in the Emmy-nominated two-parter, \"Comrades in Arms,\" in which Hawkeye and Margaret, trapped by enemy fire, engage in a little close-order drill. The humanization of Margaret continues in \"Temporary Duty,\" which also features one of the most memorable visitors to the 4077th, George \"Goober\" Lindsey, as the wild and wooly Roy Dupree, a temporary transfer who drives BJ and Charles crazy. Alan Arbus's psychiatrist Dr. Sidney Freedman, one of the series' most welcome recurring characters, makes a memorable return in \"War of Nerves,\" one of his most dramatic episodes, in which a soldier Freedman sent back into combat, is unforgiving in blaming Sidney for his injuries. Two excellent ensemble episodes are \"The Light That Failed, \"in which the reading-starved camp shares a mystery novel, but doesn't have a clue what happens after the last page is missing, and \"Mail Call Three,\" in which the camp reacts to news from home. Demerits again for no cast commentary, but this set once again offers viewers of the option of watching the episodes with or without a laugh track.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00008YGS0", "B001DMVZLW", "B001DMVZM6", "B001DMVZKI", "B000B837XS", "B001DMVZNA", "B001DMVZJY", "B000HT3P5G", "B001DMVZJO", "B001DMVZJ4", "B001DMVZN0", "B001DMVZL2", "B001DMVZNK", "B000OT6V1E", "B0024HH32A", "B000BYRCF6", "B000BNTM46", "0810980835", "B003TNW030", "B0009W5J4Q", "B000VWYJ86", "B000CCBCGM", "B00HNGC56G", "B002XKKX7K", "B00005JLIC", "B000B5XOW0", "B000BNI90Y", "B0001AW066", "B00006ZXSL", "B000XCZGW2", "B00003CXC5", "B0013LRKVC", "B001O0TWY0"], "bought_together": ["B001DMVZLW", "B001DMVZM6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001DMVZLM", "B001DMVZLW", "B00008YGS0", "B001DMVZKI"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 62494}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 35.0, "brand": "", "asin": "B0001ZJ1HW", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51X5SWV6K8L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "M*A*S*H - Season Six (Collector's Edition)"}

{"description": "ForSeinfeld, the third season's--for want of a better word--the charm. The show has found its misanthropic voice (by season's end, a fed-up Elaine tells herself, \"I gotta get some new friends\"), the ensemble has a firmer grasp of their characters, and the writers rise to the occasion with episodes that have entered theSeinfeldpantheon, including theSeinfeldequivalent of a Very Special Episode, \"The Boyfriend,\" with Keith Hernandez and theJ.F.K.parody, \"The Library,\" featuring Philip Baker Hall channeling Jack Webb as library bookhound Bookman, \"The Pez Dispenser,\" and \"The Keys,\" with an L.A.-bound Kramer winding up onMurphy Brown. Michael Richards, especially, comes into his own this season as Kramer. The first two seasons built up the mystique of this \"man-child\"/\"parasite.\" So while he was absent in season 2's \"The Chinese Restaurant,\" he is now out and about with the close-knit, albeit dysfunctional, trio. Julia Louis-Dreyfus has some of her giddiest golden moments, zonked on painkillers in \"The Pen,\" or, as a bored party guest in \"The Stranded,\" telling an obnoxious bride-to-be that \"Maybe the dingo ate your baby.\" And don't get us started on Jason Alexander as George, series co-creator Larry David's neurotic and angst-ridden alter-ego. To paraphrase what Julia Roberts said of Denzel Washington, we don't want to live in a world where Alexander doesn't have an Emmy.But it's the extensive bonus features that give this four-disc set \"hand\" over other TV-on-DVD releases. The \"Inside Look\" episode intros, optional pop-up \"Notes About Nothing,\" and candid, albeit a little too casual, commentaries offer a fount of information to even the most obsessiveSeinfeldfans. We learn that even the most outrageous episodes, such as \"The Pez Dispenser,\" were inspired by real-life events. Especially telling is Alexander's observation that Jerry never really socialized with the other ensemble members. This has extended to the commentaries: Seinfeld pairs with David on some episodes, while Alexander, Richards and Dreyfus team up on others.

{"description": "Truth, identity, and responsibility are the cornerstones ofSmallville's exceptional third season. When viewers left Clark (Tom Welling) at the end ofseason 2, he was feeling his oats in Metropolis with the help of a red Kryptonite ring, but by the opening of season 3, he must return to Smallville to not only help his parents save their farm, but seek some resolution in his relationships with Lana (Kristin Kreuk) and Lex (Michael Rosenbaum), who's returned from his abandonment at the conclusion of the previous season. Lex himself must deal with some shocking revelations regarding his relationship with his sinister father Lionel (John Glover, magnetic as always), and Lana becomes involved with a new figure in town, the mysterious Adam Knight (Lost's Ian Somerholder), who may or may not be a certain caped crusader. And speaking of heroes in disguise, the season's finale introduces Kara, a young woman with powers similar to Clark's--could she in fact be his sister, known best to comic book fans as Supergirl? Season 3 is chock full of such intriguing moments, including an appearance by futureDaily Planeteditor Perry White (Michael McKean, the real-life husband of series star Annette O'Toole) in \"Perry,\" helmed bySupergirlfilm director Jeannot Szwarc; the return of villains Jonathan Taylor Thomas, Shawn Ashmore, and Jesse Metcalfe from seasons 1 and 2 (in \"Asylum\"); the departure of series regular Samuel L. Jones; and a intrigue-fraught final turn by Christopher Reeve as Dr. Swann (\"Legacy\").The boxed set matches the high quality of the season with some terrific extras, including commentary on three episodes by series creators Alfred Gough and Miles Millar, along with Rosenbaum, Allison Mack (Chloe), and Glover. Gough and Millar also contribute commentary to a battery of deleted scenes, and Mack's \"Chloe Chronicles\" returns for another go-round. The supplemental features are rounded out by a behind-the-scenes featurette, an amusing gag reel, and an Easter egg with Rosenbaum conducting some offbeat interviews.--Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0009A5MUO", "B0001JXPPC", "B000G1R4SO", "B000N6SE4U", "B000X5SMXY", "B00005JLKB", "B001FB4VZS", "B002JVWRDQ", "B003L77GG0", "B006CR2ON6", "B000R206FK", "B001FB4W02", "B0012U7IWU", "B002JVWRE0", "B003L77GGA", "B00G4SCOJW", "B00080ZG2O", "B00G4SCKAK", "B00BBXSPCK", "B00BBXSPES", "B00BGI086Q", "B00260HH30", "B000BT96EG", "B000P6XQ50", "B004EXNHO0", "B00DTRR43W", "B001DJLD2G", "B002N5N5MK", "B00DX88IL4", "B004PHSTTS", "B000FP2OPY", "B00G7QPX6C", "B0018CWEYY", "B000J10EQU", "1419826670", "B000PE0G0A", "B00JF5G8WU", "B0000640T0", "B00CN009Y2", "B001FB4W0C", "B002DQL34G", "B00F4FFO8E", "B00280LZAE", "B000EHSVM8", "B00915G6OE", "B0049IHWYG", "B001MVWRNE", "B0041QSZ7O", "B005SH63HO", "B000SMNL92", "B008JFUPFI", "B000X5SPBI", "B002FGUHBE", "B009LDCXNY", "B005PYKVRI", "B004SEUIWY", "B00ED2IBXE", "B00066FBQQ", "B00K7IPFSM", "B0051SFSAS", "B00915G6SU", "B000BT96FA", "B000HLDF9U", "B000F8O2P6", "B000A5046K", "B000O77SMW", "B0019LY5IM", "B000F8O2OW", "B00915G6TE", "B00EIL7E9C", "B003L77GGK", "B000R7GKQE", "B00B5J6A7W", "B00K7IPGS6", "B004LROMWU", "B00DYEN6XC", "B00023E88U", "B003ITZBVS", "B000B8384G", "B000CCBC9O", "B000I0QLS2", "B009LDD626", "B0025KVKDE", "B001C8W7EQ", "B00GTZWUPS", "B0002CX1M0", "B001MVWRN4", "1401210600", "B004HW7JNS", "1401234860", "B00IYRLUAU", "B00JPS6A3O", "B0072OFM28", "B004EPZ084", "B002JVWRAO", "B00915G6NK", "B00BEJL6JK", "B00JPS7HOA", "B005QET8FS", "B00CPEK3NI"], "bought_together": ["B0009A5MUO", "B0001JXPPC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0001JXPPC", "B0009A5MUO", "B000N6SE4U", "B000G1R4SO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 10632}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 29.69, "brand": "WEA", "asin": "B0002Y0QV2", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51FG3cFcvQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Smallville: Season 3"}

{"description": "The groundbreaking showMillenniumwas about to take a new, visionary direction in its second season.Millenniumcould have continued its successful formula of  introducing new, apocalyptic \"Se7en-esque\" serial killers for Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) to hunt down.  But as any viewer can attest, it was the exploration of the mysterious \"Millennium Group\" and Frank Black's role that held the key to the show's potential longevity.  And who better to build a mythos for theMillenniumthan the minds behindThe X-Files: producer/writer team Glenn Morgan and James Wong. Stepping in when Chris Carter stepped aside, Morgan and Wong immediately began to focus season 2 not on the killers and their impact on Armageddon, but on Frank Black and his struggle for his personal stability and sanity.  The Millennium Group, whose identify and function was never really explored inseason 1, now becomes a central entity in season 2 complete with its own Masonic-like mythology.Picking up where season 1 ends, Frank Black's stalker, the \"Polaroid man,\" has kidnapped his wife, Catherine (Megan Gallagher). While searching for his wife, Frank begins to learn that the group has not exactly been open with him and their secrets run a lot deeper than he ever imagined. Building on this tragedy, season 2 follows Frank's downward spiral: his strained relationship with his wife, the loss of his sanctuary \"the yellow house,\" his disenchantment and eventual confrontation with the Millennium Group, and his struggle to maintain a normal relationship with his daughter, Jordan (Brittany Tiplady), in the face of Armageddon. Season 1 was definitely dark and fantastic, but somehow maintained a strong sense of realism. With Morgan and Wong at the helm, season 2 further explores the dark and fantastical, but becomes a lot more surreal, but no less fascinating.  So whether you are drawn to stories about dark serial killers (\"The Mikado\"), the ongoing tales of conspiracies (\"The Hand of St. Sebastian,\" \"Owls,\" and \"Roosters\"), familiar comedies (\"Jos&#xE9; Chung's Doomsday Defense\"), or the bizarre (\"Somehow, Satan Got Behind Me\"), season 2 has something for you. Tragically, there would only be one more season before one of the best shows of the '90s would be cancelled.--Rob Bracco", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0009X76XW", "B000244E2O", "B0006UEVUE", "B000CNE0TC", "B000CNE0T2", "B000EXDS3E", "B000CNE0SS", "B000EXDS3Y", "B000BOH990", "B0007X7044", "B000BOH98G", "B000EXDS34", "B000O77SMW", "B000BOH986", "B00KS9V6EC", "B001FACH7S", "B0000AOX0A", "B000FOPPBA", "B00028HOMM", "B002JVWRD6", "B0011FLGZQ", "B00B5ARKC0", "B0081QF6Q8", "B00023P4UQ", "B000OCXNQW", "B006TBYC76", "B003UD7J26", "B0053O8A46", "B00DII0MGI", "B00166UFTI", "B0013DZNAA", "B000F3UAE8", "B000ERVJKY", "B0006BAWYM", "0060083972", "B0001O3YD0", "B0057FGD3Q", "B0001KL5JY", "B000I0QLR8", "B000JLTRMC", "B003L77G2Y", "B0002VEUV2", "B0001I55O2", "B000NTMA1U", "B001RHGRTS", "B0006UEVTK", "B004YPED14", "B000H5TH16", "B000FJH5M2", "B003R0MEYA", "B002U0KHME", "B000EHSVL4", "B0009JE6G6", "B0037AGB9O", "B003L77GUG", "B000NOIX7U", "B000O77SN6", "B0012IXBNC", "B00CJ6EKT0", "B00006ADEM", "B000QUEQ4U", "B000AJJNFE", "B00242KD1S", "B00CRX82LM", "B0032JTUX4", "B0001906X6", "B005LAIHXQ", "B000B8IA08", "B00ALTQRNO", "B007C8RZXS", "B0015TX2LO", "B001DXS4DI", "B000EHSVBE", "B005TTEG5W", "B001MVWRNO", "B005PPMHWE", "B0002V7OI8", "B00A2XQTVY", "B001715A92", "B001G7PSZI", "B008YRL6LI", "B0002HOEQ2", "B003R0MF0S", "B006JN87CU", "B000BNI90Y", "B00A2XQU7M", "B00AMDA2QC", "B00003CXGA", "B0024FAD9C", "B002ZCY872"], "bought_together": ["B0009X76XW", "B000244E2O"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001CY5N00", "B000244E2O", "B0006UEVUE", "B0009X76XW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 59231}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 30.49, "brand": "Millenium", "asin": "B000667HBS", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51-yEdhHXUL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Millennium - The Complete Second Season"}
{"description": "Submitted for your approval:The Twilight Zone's inaugural season, all 36 episodes complete with Rod Serling's original promos for the following week's episode, not seen since their original broadcast. To discuss television's greatest anthology series whose title has become pop culture shorthand for the bizarre and supernatural is to immediately become like Albert Brooks and Dan Aykroyd inTwilight Zone: The Movie; a can-you-top-this recall of famous shocks and favorite twists. Several essential episodes hail from this season, among them, \"Time Enough at Last\" starring Burgess Meredith as a bespectacled bookworm who is the lone survivor of an atomic blast; \"The After-Hours\" starring Anne Francis as a department store shopper haunted by mannequins; and the profoundly disturbing \"The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street,\" in which fear and prejudice turns neighbor against neighbor (and, by the by, whose alien observers inspired Kang and Kodos onThe Simpsons).From an unsettlingly persistent hitchhiker to a malevolent slot machine,The Twilight Zone's first season did plumb \"the pit of man's fears.\" One forgets how moving the series could be. Three of this season's most memorable and enduring episodes are the poignant and primal \"stop-the-world-I-want-to-get-off fantasies, \"Walking Distance,\" \"A Stop at Willougby\" and \"The Sixteen-Millimeter Shrine,\" in which desperate characters seek refuge in a simpler past. Serling's few stabs at comedy (\"Mr. Bevis,\" \"The Mighty Casey\") have not aged well, but the series finale, \"A World of His Own,\" starring Keenan Wynn as a playwright whose fictional characters come to life, has a brilliant capper. The episodes are more deliberately paced than one might remember. Less patient younger viewers might be anxious to get to the payoffs, but once they settle into the rhythm, they will savor the literate writing and the performances by such veteran actors as Ed Wynn, Everett Sloan, and Ida Lupino, and newcomers such as Jack Klugman. The extras, including the unaired version of the pilot episode, \"Where is Everybody?\", audio commentaries and recollections, and a Serling college lecture, truly take this six-disc set to another dimension.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00BQK4YDC", "B00C6F61S2", "B000BC8T1E", "B00CPTUN8S", "B000AL733G", "B000AYEIIQ", "B00068NVLQ", "B0002CX1M0", "B0002J4ZX2", "B001DXS4DI", "B000HDR814", "B002NPY7GS", "B006TBYC76", "1879505096", "B000VDDDY6", "B0000DC3VM", "B000UAE7VS", "B0007Y08P6", "B00005JOJE", "B00092ZLDK", "B0009UC7MK", "B0007Y08RY", "B000O59A52", "B00198X0YK", "B00007ELE6", "B001DHXT3Y", "B00269PU2G", "B000LC4ZIA", "B000GETUDI", "B006TTC5A4", "B00H4KQN82", "B002TSAAS8", "B005UL4NF2", "B001E6HUWK", "B000BITV1A", "B001LM64VK", "B00JEZWRE4", "B003NOGNQU", "B0017VG69U", "B001DB6J50", "B00005N5RM", "B000062XFG", "B00133QNSG", "B000N2HD6O", "B000CCBCD0", "B001G0MFLU", "B00005LC4K", "B000Z6GT1I", "B000TXPXD2", "B000HWZ4HU", "B000SSQ7JW", "B000IHYXJO", "B00005Y1NF", "B000H5U5EE", "B008L36520", "B005LVIP1E", "B0019F030M", "B001AQO43M", "B000TJBNF8", "B0019PL2JI", "B000063V8S", "B000B7HZUK", "B001992NZG", "B0002WZTLQ", "B0000714AP", "B00D97DMQU", "B00D9EJFZA", "B000CNE0TC", "B005E7SEOI", "B00009VRF0", "B000HEZEYG", "B003CN5B7E", "B004FECNJ8", "B000MGBSH6", "B000F48D0U", "B00005JLRT", "B000TLTCT0", "B003L77G7Y", "B007KFZ85K", "B002GSXKQA", "B0040NFQ0W", "B001RIZ7OI", "B0089LT7ZG", "B000ASDFIQ", "B0007Y08LK", "B000T9OP7G", "B000BF0C8E", "B001JFKWE4", "B00A2L1CKO", "B00DZP1C9K", "0783240961", "B00871C09S", "B001GUYAZY", "B000FA57U8", "B000QQJ3Q0", "B0000VD04M", "B000BGR1B4", "B00ANGIAU8", "B000GW8UAE", "B0001WTWS8"], "bought_together": ["B00BQK4YDC", "B00C6F61S2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000H5U5EE", "B00BQK4YDC", "B00C6F61S2", "B00D9EJG2M"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 107871}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 42.09, "brand": "Image Entertainment", "asin": "B00068NVMK", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51EzHtftO7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Twilight Zone - Season 1 (The Definitive Edition)"}
{"description": "This breathtaking blend of documentary and fiction filmmaking provides an  unobtrusive glimpse into the relationships, rituals, and livelihood of a  four-generation family of nomadic shepherds in the Gobi desert of South  Mongolia. It is birthing season for the family&#x92;s herd of camels and after  several healthy foals are born, the last birth is difficult. With quiet  perseverance, the family helps to deliver a rare white colt, which the  mother camel quickly rejects and refuses to nurse. With growing  concern for the colt&#x92;s survival, the family decides to employ a nomadic  singing ritual to coax the mother into nurturing her young. They send the  two eldest sons on a journey to the nearest village to fetch a musician for  the \"hoos ritual.\" The story unfolds gently, sensitive to the rhythms of  desert life while honoring its real-life actors. This modest yet magnificent  film is the graduation project of film students Byambasuren Davaa and Luigi  Falorni, extending beyond the tale of a camel and colt to explore the  fragility and beauty of an ancient way of life.

{"description": "The Cat Returns(2002) brings back Muta, the cranky fat cat, and Baron von Gikkingen, the elegant statue, from the  featureWhisper of the Heart(1995). On her way home from school, Haru, a confused 17-year-old, prevents an elegant gray cat from being hit by a truck. She's inadvertently saved the life of Lune, Prince of the Cat Kingdom, and his royal father decides to thank her. He fills her locker with gift-wrapped mice and decides she should come to his kingdom and marry Lune. Haru seeks help from the Cat Bureau, and eventually returns to relatively normal life, with the assistance of Muta and the Baron.The Cat ReturnsrecallsWhisper of  the Heartand Takashi Nakamura'sCatnapped, but it offers neither the wistful charm of the former nor the bold visual imagination of the latter. Hayao Miyazaki has been seeking young directors for Studio Ghibli for several years. After preparing the script and storyboards forWhisper, he turned the film over to Yoshifumi Kondo, who died tragically shortly after the film's release.The Cat Returnswas directed by Hiroyuki Morita, who shows promise, but lacks Kondo's elegant sensibility. The DVD extras include a fulsome making-of documentary, Morita's voluminous storyboards, and mini-interviews with the vocal cast that includes Tim Curry, Cary Elwes, Peter Boyle, and Elliott Gould.

{"description": "\"The love impulse in man,\" says a psychiatrist inBringing Up Baby, \"frequently reveals itself in terms of conflict.\" That's for sure. For a primer on the rules and regulations of the classic screwball comedy, which throws love and conflict into close proximity, look no further. A straight-laced paleontologist (Cary Grant) loses a dinosaur bone to a dog belonging to free-spirited heiress Katharine Hepburn. In trying to retrieve said bone, Grant is drawn into the vortex surrounding the delicious Hepburn, which becomes a flirtatious pas de deux that will transform both of them. Director Howard Hawks plays the complications as a breathless escalation of their \"love impulse,\" yet the movie is nonetheless romantic for all its speed. (Hawks'sHis Girl Friday, also with Grant, goes even faster.) Grant and Hepburn are a match made in movie heaven, in sync with each other throughout. Not a great box-office success when first released,Bringing Up Babyhas since taken its place as a high-water mark of the screwball form, and it was used as a model for Peter Bogdanovich'sWhat's Up, Doc?Re-creating the role she originated in Philip Barry's wickedly witty Broadway play, Katharine Hepburn stars as the spoiled and snobby socialite Tracy Lord inThe Philadelphia Story, one of the great romantic comedies from the golden age of MGM studios. Applying her impossibly high ideals to everyone but herself, Tracy is about to marry a stuffy executive when her congenial ex-husband (Cary Grant), arrives to protect his former father-in-law from a potentially scandalous tabloid expos&#xE9;. In an Oscar-winning role, James Stewart is the scandal reporter who falls for Tracy as her wedding day arrives, throwing her into a dizzying state of premarital jitters. Who will join Tracy at the altar? Snappy dialogue flows like sparkling wine under the sophisticated direction of George Cukor in this film that turned the tide of Hepburn's career from \"box-office poison\" to glamorous Hollywood star.MGM originally promotedDinner at Eightby touting the \"all-star cast,\" but this is no run-of-the-mill omnibus picture. On the contrary, rather than cramming as many big names as possible into a lumbering vehicle, the movie's impeccably crafted script (by Edna Ferber and Herman J. Mankiewicz) and direction (by George Cukor) gave some immortal screen luminaries a chance to shine. For sheer bravery, John Barrymore's achingly poignant performance as Larry Renault, a washed-up matinee idol who has \"outlived everything but his vanity,\" is unmatched. Barrymore's brother, Lionel, is equally touching as shipping magnate Oliver Jordan. Oliver vainly tries to save his family's century-old firm, at the same time hiding his financial and health troubles from his wife, Millicent, played to hysterical perfection by Billie Burke. The Great Depression is presented in microcosm as Millicent frets about throwing the ultimate society dinner, oblivious to the world tumbling down around her. She is forced to invite to her precious party such undesirables as crass financier Dan Packard (\"HesmellsOklahoma!\"). Even worse in Millicent's eyes than Packard (Wallace Beery, doing an impressive steamroller imitation) is his social-climbing wife, Kitty (Jean Harlow, never funnier). Be sure to watch for Harlow's brief encounter with Marie Dressler, who brings an extraordinary winking wisdom to the role of aging star Carlotta Vance. As the two enter the dining room in the film's final scene, Harlow makes an offhand remark that elicits from Dressler one of the great screen double takes of all time. Like so much ofDinner at Eight, the moment is priceless.Newspaper comedy doesn't seem like an MGM genre--ink-stained wretches don't go with Adrian gowns and white deco furniture--but Jack Conway, the designated bull in the Metro china shop (Boom Town,Too Hot to Handle) does what he can to bring some dash and flair toLibeled Lady's wildly complicated script. Spencer Tracy is the tough city editor who goes to some spectacular extremes when socialite Myrna Loy files a $5 million libel suit against his paper for calling her a notorious home-wrecker; he hires celebrated ladies' man William Powell to seduce Loy and asks his long-suffering fianc&#xE9;e, Jean Harlow, to marry Powell temporarily so she can play the wronged wife when Loy and Powell are discovered together. The couples crisscross, with frenetic and not entirely unpredictable results, but much of the pleasure here lies in seeing these iconic stars being so thoroughly themselves. The dialogue strains for champagne wit, but the movie's most memorable moment is pure, rotgut slapstick--Powell's bout with an unruly fly-fishing rod.This one's all about the ladies. InStage Door, an absolutely terrific 1937 gem, a Manhattan boardinghouse for aspiring actresses houses an amazing roster of golden-era performers--some of whom, like their characters, were just breaking in. It's hard to say who's in best form here: Katharine Hepburn in blueblood mode, Ginger Rogers streetwise, Andrea Leeds suffering, Lucille Ball and Ann Miller impossibly young, and Eve Arden being, well, splendidly Eve Ardenish. The sassy comedy and sober life lessons are wonderfully mixed by the underrated director Gregory La Cava (My Man Godfrey), who captures the brashness of '30s female chatter in a much pleasanter way than the more famousThe Women. Hepburn's sublime attempts to wrestle with the line about calla lilies being in bloom will make you smile long after the movie's over.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0009S4IJM", "B000ION7A8", "B000E6ESWG", "B006TTC5JK", "B000GRUQL0", "B008D1Q1VU", "B000N3T0GY", "B0006Z2KYI", "B000ION7AI", "B000E8JO32", "B0024FAG7Q", "B003ZKBELG", "B001D8W7EA", "B000GRUQLK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004GJYR7I", "B001KXZGNW", "B0045HCJQW", "B008D1Q1VU"]}, "price": 7.48, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 176809}, "asin": "B0006Z2KXY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516HqvPiwPL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Classic Comedies Collection (Bringing Up Baby / The Philadelphia Story Two-Disc Special Edition / Dinner at Eight / Libeled Lady / Stage Door / To Be or Not to Be)"}
{"description": "Bravery, commitment to friendship, and personal sacrifice empower the weak and give rise to unlikely heroes in the magical world ofFairytopia.  Elina (played by Barbie) is a wingless fairy who is mercilessly teased by a trio of spiteful fairies.  Luckily for Elina, Dandelion (a fellow fairy) and Bibble (a cute little puffball) are good, supportive friends.  When the evil Laverna plots to take over Fairytopia and spreads a potion that causes an epidemic of flying sickness in Fairytopia, Elina is the only fairy not overcome with the illness.  It's up to Elina, Bibble, and new friend Hue to find a way to defeat Laverna and save Fairytopia from ruin.  While the brightly colored animation ofFairytopiais enticing and the messages of friendship and sacrifice wholesome, the story line and characters are shallow and predictable.  Worse yet, the colloquial dialogue and prepubescent attitude of many of the characters is downright annoying.  While young Barbie fans will doubtless enjoyFairytopia,Barbie Princess and the Pauper,Barbie Nutcracker, andBarbie Swan Lakeoffer richer story lines with better developed and more likeable characters.  On a technical note, the DVD played fine on three test DVD players (Sony and Panasonic).

{"description": "The dazed, dreamlike world of director David Gordon Green remains intact, althoughUndertowhas more story than his previous gems (All the Real Girls,George Washington). In the hot, green Georgia countryside, a man (Dermot Mulroney) lives with his two sons on a farm; their existence is shattered by the arrival of the man's Faulknerian brother (Josh Lucas), a dangerous sort with an ulterior motive. The movie that follows is likeThe Night of the Hunterfiltered through aDays of Heavenlens--there's even aHeaven-like narration provided by Jamie Bell. That's what you get for having Terrence Malick produce your movie. The plot doesn't always sit comfortably with Green's uncanny style--sometimes it feels like an intrusion on a private world of childhood--and Josh Lucas is \"actory\" in a way that most Green actors are not. Green is at his best when noticing some stray detail (the younger brother likes to arrange his books according to smell), not when connecting the dots of story. Still, the images will stick in your mind, Tim Orr's cinematography is superb, and Philip Glass provides a suitably mysterioso score.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000YV1Q2G", "B0040ILVME", "B0000AZT1G", "B000VE4UHO", "B001R88C72", "B0000YTOL2", "B000BX8R1A", "B00005JN0D", "B000OVLBGM", "B000A7Q2I2", "B001FB55XA", "B003Y5H4W0", "B00009ZPTY", "B000I2J736", "B001DN0V02", "B000DBHX4M", "B00005V8TD", "B004SEUIW4", "B00177Y9ZC", "B001ER4CQQ", "B0084CAU2O", "B0034G4P6W", "B00CBFB8SU", "B00HE00XE2", "B0002235P8", "B002MD3USC", "B002UJIY2A", "B003CJXIWS", "B0041LULL2", "B006ISJR7U", "B002SF9YUM", "B00AEFYCL4", "B003PAXOL4", "B000V6LSOA", "B0083H6AQA", "B00IKM5OYW", "B002FG9N78", "B000BQ5J2C", "B00D3LA5WG", "B00BEIYKM6", "B004AE3QYE", "B004KA1DGG", "B00FRH0H3Q", "B004OUZLGK", "B00A47BT7C", "B00005Y4RY", "B00GM5GLDW", "B0034G4P30", "B00IJS2OHM", "B004O26LAI", "B00F8PTALC", "B003EYVXTG", "B00J0IN6Z4", "B00003CXIA", "B00EL6AD5Q", "B0034G4P58", "B000M341SC", "B0009X75O2", "B00GS08X2S", "B0088EDOIK", "B003498SCQ", "B00009MEJ4", "B00K0MM4AM", "B000F8O2QU", "B00FXOO1VC", "B009SFR2QI", "B0037QGS0A", "B00H0EN98Y", "B009T3AE1Y", "B000C20VVE", "B00HUCF420", "B00HUTPKA4", "B003Y5H4R0", "B00HHYF5EI", "B00005Y6XA", "B00EL6ADGU", "B001B1UO7G", "B00D3DJIG8", "B0083V2VYG", "B00CBFB8WQ", "B00000F7E6", "B00GBT62PQ", "B00HE00ZIQ", "B005Z9MFCM", "B00HOGBXS6", "B00003CXPD", "B0001DMVBC", "6305308853", "B00G5GNZ78", "B00GHP8SH4", "B002BWP4A6", "B004ZKKKW4", "B00HF98SHG", "B003Z8ZC2A", "B002ASABF4", "B0000A2ZU3", "B000EDWLLY", "B00F6Y3DFE", "B00023P4N8", "B00HVOFP6W"], "bought_together": ["B000BX8R1A"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004KA1DGG", "B000BX8R1A", "B0000AZT1G", "B001R88C72"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 157735}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.99, "brand": "Lucas", "asin": "B0007R4T3K", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515X5FZC3FL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Undertow"}

{"description": "Taking off from an amazing true story,The Last Shotmines some pleasing inside-Hollywood gags about indie-film production. But this is no ordinary indie:  An FBI agent (Alec Baldwin) sets up an elaborate ruse to sting some mobsters in Rhode Island, by picking a screenplay from the slush pile and financing pre-production. The movie will never be made, but the bogus production will lure the mobsters into the trap. The hitch is, the starry-eyed writer-director (Matthew Broderick), cast, and crew have no idea they're part of an undercover operation--the poor saps think their ship has come in and they're actually making a movie. Adding to the joke is that Baldwin finds himself enchanted by the moviemaking world and beginning to care about his unsuspecting stooge (Broderick is at his most engaging). Writer-director Jeff Nathanson (who scriptedCatch Me if You Can) doesn't quite trust this funny set-up, sweetening the pot with too sentimental nudges, but the two stars develop a handy odd-couple chemistry.

{"description": "Like a groovy Family von Trapp,The Partridge Familyarrived in 1970 with matching velvet outfits and wholesomeness bursting from every pore. Watching it now, you expect little more than kitsch--but the show, though certainly a sitcom representation of the world, is curiously fresh and appealing. This sheer likeability comes partly from the cast--Shirley Jones (The Music Man) looks foxy in miniskirts while still being the cool mom everyone wishes they had; teen idol David Cassidy is unexpectedly engaging as an actor (his charisma is all the more apparent when another teen idol, Bobby Sherman, makes a wooden appearance); and Danny Bonaduce's child-star rise sprang not from cuteness but his genuine comic timing. It doesn't hurt that many of the troubles the characters faced--swelled heads, rivalry, groupies (!)--were undoubtedly problems the actors were facing  as their show became a hit.Sure, there are utterly ridiculous episodes, such as when Danny is tutoring a mob boss's girlfriend about the stock market and the gangster, not knowing Danny is only 10 years old, gets jealous--but most episodes feature ordinary show business conflicts or straightforward family issues, like how the kids cope when their mother starts dating or how teenager Laurie (Susan Dey, who later went on toL.A. Law) feels ugly when she gets braces. This simplicity, combined with some classic vaudeville-style humor, proves surprisingly durable. Plus, the list of guest stars ranges from Ray Bolger (best known as the Scarecrow inThe Wizard of Oz) to a young Richard Pryor, as well as other soon-to-be-famous folk likeCharlie's Angels' Farrah Fawcett and Jaclyn Smith and a pre-Star WarsMark Hamill. The first season collection includes a bonus CD with four of the Partridge Family's actual radio hits; their sound, a fusion of the Monkees and the Mamas and the Papas, is pure pop sugar (created by a host of Brill Building songwriters like Neil Sedaka). If the Mondrian-inspired paint job on the Partridge Family bus gives you childhood flashbacks, you'll happily regress when you watch this box set.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000B6CODY", "B001LRTT3A", "B001DHE9FQ", "B0006Z2L4W", "B00701QR86", "B0009I7NH6", "B000A0GORS", "B000B5XOUM", "B000CCBCHQ", "B0012GMXPQ", "B0009B16TO", "B000E33VZ4", "B000TV4QWS", "B0012GMZAO", "B005FLD3KS", "B000EXZFS0", "B000E3L7EQ", "B00004OCRR", "B000291Q3Y", "B000MGBSEY", "B00005JO4F", "B0050MB5AC", "B00DXLO0BI", "B00003TFNR", "B000HIVIOM", "B00005JOEB", "B000EQ45BU", "B00008WJEZ", "B000HEZEYG", "B0007CNY54", "B000E3L7FK", "B000FI8MQG", "B0014FAIYS", "B000291Q3O", "B000P6R9O4", "0446395315", "B000PISZ86", "B000002OND", "B000ASDFIQ", "B0012GN19S", "B0012GMWQG", "B0002JZT5U", "B005R2SHX8", "B00280QNKG", "B000002VGR", "B005FLD3EE", "B000095J74", "B000Z6GT18", "B000B8IA3U", "0755315804", "0060950757", "B0009B16TY", "B000FSMEB0", "B00DXLO0D6", "B0012GN0YO", "B00JAD6BYW", "B0000V4906", "B001LRTT30", "B00008EYBH", "B00A2L1CKO", "B00ERH175Y", "B000H1RFF0", "B0009UC80G", "B00AEFXKIK", "B0001DMXEC", "B00005JLIC", "B008H6GHII", "B0000DFZ5O", "B000KLQUSK", "B00HZMZ286", "B000C6NPHC", "B00HVFA36I", "0755315790", "B0002NY8PI", "B003W5C0TY", "B000TD48SI", "B000FDFSH2", "B0006BAWSI", "B00GOC74RU", "B00BUWD7NE", "B001LRL4Y2", "B00DXLO086", "B00018D3RI", "B00007KK5I", "B000VS6R30", "B000G0O5J6", "B001E6JC30", "B001NRPQKI", "B000LE16VC", "B00465I17Y", "B0019BI114", "B00G5N6C8U", "B005LFQRTC", "B000EQ5PTQ", "B00A4Y62JU", "B000NQRV8U", "B000MGBSQM", "B00IF0KAYS", "B000CELOV8", "B00BO9PJAM"], "bought_together": ["B000B6CODY", "B001DHE9FQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00DXLO0BI", "B0009I7NH6", "B00DXLO0D6", "B000B5XOUM"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 39867}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 8.8, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B0007V6IWQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51v03PoYtKL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Partridge Family - The Complete First Season"}

{"description": "Will Smith's easygoing charm makesHitchthe kind of pleasant, uplifting romantic comedy that you could recommend to almost anyone--especially if there's romance in the air. As suave Manhattan dating consultant Alex \"Hitch\" Hitchens, Smith plays up the smoother, sophisticated side of his established screen persona as he mentors a pudgy accountant (Kevin James) on the lessons of love. The joke, of course, is that Hitch's own love life is a mess, and as he coaches James toward romance with a rich, powerful, and seemingly inaccessible beauty named Allegra (Amber Valetta), he's trying too hard to impress a savvy gossip columnist (Eva Mendes) with whom he's fallen in love. Through mistaken identities and mismatched couples, director Andy Tennant brings the same light touch that made Drew Barrymore'sEver Afterso effortlessly engaging. As romantic comedies go,Hitchdoesn't offer any big surprises, but as a date movie it gets the job done with amiable ease and style.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0009RCPUW", "B001QERPAC", "B0013J55B6", "B000N6U0E2", "B0001Z3TXE", "B00005JN0T", "B0013FDM7E", "B00AEFY99O", "B003Y5H4ZW", "B000VXWX7E", "B002K0WBXW", "B000803BQC", "B000BKVQS4", "B000HT386M", "B003Y5H574", "0800141741", "6305428115", "B00007E2F5", "B00005JMW7", "B00AEBB9WI", "B00008G8M4", "B002VECM6S", "B000LC3ICE", "B000ELJAEM", "B00003CXSM", "B004EPZ0BG", "B00AEBB8NS", "076780421X", "B00164KYV4", "B00AEFY0F2", "B003Y5H524", "B000VG66XS", "B00008WJD6", "B00AEFXWXI", "B002ZG998G", "B002ZG989G", "B000YDBPAM", "B000CEV3KU", "B00005JPE3", "B000AP04FG", "B00005JLQN", "B001C5LLQ4", "B00003CXO1", "B002P413IC", "B0001AVZA8", "B0012KJ0DK", "B0015I2RT8", "B000E6EHE0", "B001NPD9RM", "B00008VFCA", "B00006ZXSL", "B000FGGWGK", "B000098XQ8", "B001OQCUZM", "B000MQC9H4", "B00005JN3W", "B00005IBN0", "B003BV8ICC", "B00006FMUW", "B001SN78JO", "B000RBA6C4", "B0009UZGIM", "B001GKJ2E8", "B00005JNTU", "B000ZBEOEC", "B00AEFY4CG", "B0000B1OFL", "B008RNYMG0", "B0038N9WKU", "B0021L8UYY", "B000683VI4", "6304765266", "B000TZJBPQ", "B00005JLSB", "B0007PLLBU", "B000059TG6", "B002ZG9968", "B003EYVXXC", "B0000897EG", "B00005JM4Q", "B004IK30MI", "B00081U7HC", "B002ZG97B0", "B000P0J0EW", "B00005O5CM", "B005F2JRUC", "B000ASDFGI", "B00005JKCH", "B0006GAI5U", "B0000AKCKI", "B001UV4XRY", "B00005JMQW", "B0010X5X4O", "B000M341QE", "B001AKTZW8", "B00024JC4E", "B00AEBB8R4", "B00005JKMQ", "B00CLSBNNM", "B005LAII2Q"], "bought_together": ["B000N6U0E2", "B001QERPAC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000N6U0E2", "B002ZG97TW", "B002VECM6S", "B000AP04FG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 105544}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.94, "brand": "SMITH,WILL", "asin": "B000957O7S", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41jGu0AHCAL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Hitch (Fullscreen Edition)"}

{"description": "Dark Wateris Japanese horror auteur Hideo Nakata's return to the genre after hisRingcycle made you too scared to watch television ever again. WhereRingudealt with a supernatural force wreaking revenge via technology, this film is a much more traditional ghost story. After winning a custody battle for her daughter, single mother Yoshimi moves into what she thinks is the perfect apartment with her daughter Hitomi. No sooner have they unpacked than strange things begin to disturb their new life. A water leak from the supposedly abandoned apartment above gets bigger and bigger, a child's satchel reappears even though Yoshimi throws it away several times, and she is haunted by the image of a child wearing a yellow mackintosh who bears a striking resemblance to a young girl who disappeared several years before. The conventional narrative follows Yoshimi's increasingly desperate attempts to discover who or what force is haunting her daughter, but the story's execution is far from predictable. Nakata is the master of understated suspense: there's always a feeling of motiveless malignancy that runs like an undercurrent through his films--far more frightening than out and out shocks--and here he also practically drowns his audience in water imagery. The film is saturated; the relentless dripping in the apartment, the constant rain outside and the deliberately washed-out photography make any color, such as the yellow coat, seem incongruous and unsettling. Nakata also clears the film of unnecessary characters--this is an almost deserted Tokyo--preferring to concentrate the action on Yoshimi's rising hysteria as she struggles to understand what is happening and how to save her daughter. Granted, the special effects are somewhat unconvincing and the ending confused, but even so the result is a stylish and disquieting chiller that will do for bathtubs what hisRingfilms did for video recorders.--Kristen Bowditch", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000GSYRY6", "B000E0OE4O", "B00005JNJR", "B000GB5MOW", "B000LPS3B2", "B000H0M4CK", "B000E3LGMY", "B000A2XA8M", "B004O63TWW", "B00DW5IM14", "B000AWYOGE", "B000Q7ZKWU", "B000088NQR", "B0000AVHAO", "B000FS9FIA", "B003UTPL2A", "B000FVQYW2", "B000MEYKCI", "B000FZEQEQ", "B002P7UCJK", "B0000CC885", "B0009KQOZQ", "B0009WFEDC", "B000H5U5YO", "B000MM0LHS", "B0007XBM8O", "B000NO243E", "B000CSTKHE", "B0009X765K", "B0006SGYL0", "B000AAF25S", "B000MM0LH8", "B0018JKLT2", "B000GBEWNY", "B001KEGR66", "B000FZEQFK", "B0028DRGDQ", "B00BOYLIAC", "B000NA28GG", "B00136MBUW", "B0019X3YX2", "B00005LW4G", "B0002ZDW7Q", "B000CRR3ME", "B004P2VQZ2", "B0007CNY2W", "B0009YA3YA", "B000BVM240", "B00260LDSU", "B0009S2T0M", "B0002J4X20", "B002E2QH8G", "B00009MEC4", "B000FZEQVY", "B0000YAEHK", "B002U041OE", "B00HI9QDXO", "B001570H5K", "B00AEFYYH6", "B000NA21RM", "B0015ET3YO", "B0007GAG42", "B0009NCQL4", "B000F0UUMI", "B001VG2MAI", "B004H2CXBQ", "B00104AYG0", "B001MEJY8W", "B00125WAW8", "B000BGH2A4", "B000AM4PGI", "B001P3SA9Y", "B000EDWKZ6", "B0010SAGHS", "B000A2X3U2", "B0009W5KHW", "B000S0GYRU", "B00344EAM8", "B005D0RDPM", "B001221DUQ", "B0000CABGW", "B002OMIKSG", "B00BUBE2N4", "B008NNY8XQ", "B00019JR5Y", "B00AEFY2E6", "B0009XRZQK", "B006L4MWVE", "B00BOUXNNQ", "B00004W3HF", "B008G1JIQC", "B007I1Q4IG", "B000R7HY32", "B00GHH9IIA", "B0009X763M", "B00006AUIG", "B00009OWI1", "B0001EFV7M", "B000IMUYJM", "B0016MJ6KQ"], "bought_together": ["B000E0OE4O", "B000GSYRY6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000AWYOGE", "B00DW5IM14", "B000GSYRY6", "B0009WFEDC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 135749}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 13.99, "brand": "ADV Films", "asin": "B0009KA2UO", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41KFCTBTH3L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Dark Water"}

{"description": "The charm, the zaniness, the corny jokes, the showbiz cliches--every element ofThe Muppet Showholds up 30 years after Jim Henson's legendary variety series' debut season. Well, perhaps not everything: Today's younger viewers might have a hard time placing some ofThe Muppet Show's then-guest stars, such as Florence Henderson or Ruth Buzzi. But then, theShow's real celebrities are perennial icons Kermit the Frog, Miss Piggy, Gonzo the... whatever, Fozzie Bear, Animal, and the rest of the Muppets' harried, well-meaning family of entertainers.Season Onefinds the show pretty much in the basic shape longtime fans will remember: A musical introduction followed by backstage chaos, another musical number, a sketch, a scene with the guest star, and so on. A half-hour episode can fly by pretty quickly, but it's interesting to note that the series hadn't quite found its familiar tone through much of the first year. A reliance on too many disposable verbal jokes and redundant, so-so material for sketch fodder ultimately gives way to more creative premises and the development of key relationships between characters. By the final half-dozen episodes in the first season,The Muppet Showis truly cooking. Season highlights include Kermit's confession to guest Juliet Prowse that he always wanted to be a dancer, and Prowse's comparison of the little green superstar to Robert Redford. Joel Grey does a cabaret-style act for a roomful of Muppets and is later outraged when Kermit's introduction of the actor proves so thorough there is nothing left for the latter to say. Rita Moreno proves quite game in a funny piece, set in a French cafe, in which her dance with a man-size Muppet turns from romantic to table-smashing violent. Harvey Korman plays bumbling ringmaster Maurice the Magnificent, easily the worst animal trainer in history. Phyllis Diller bats out shameless one-liners (\"I sang 'Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star,' and it fell on me\"), and Vincent Price toys with his own horror film image by playing a ghoul who turns into a maudlin orchestra conductor at midnight.--Tom KeoghStills fromThe Muppet Show(click for larger image)The divine Miss PiggyKermit and Miss PiggyFozzie Bear and KermitSing along!Everyone's a critic", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000Q6774K", "B0013527I4", "B00CUEIP56", "B00CUDD0KW", "B004EPZ03O", "B000ATQYTW", "B00005JO4H", "B000ATQYTC", "B00EDUCO3O", "B00005BCJR", "B006JTS5OO", "0316182990", "B00I8VLDFE", "B0062DB7K6", "B00AP2DA9G", "B00BCMT4B6", "1465417486", "B0000A2ZU9", "B00I8VLE76", "B0052LE7BA", "B000ATQYT2", "B003XURDCC", "B0000844MM", "B000H6SY8C", "B000AA4F2O", "B00006AUHR", "B000UNYJTK", "B0052LE7A6", "B00H4RL2H2", "B00I8VLBZG", "B000CCBCA8", "B005UQHDPY", "0316277630", "B000H6SY1E", "B00B2ZZV5G", "0679412034", "B0062DCBZ6", "B00000JYLT", "B00IKSI1UU", "B0069RY7V6", "B008I218K8", "B006345IB8", "B00961EO1A", "B007KW5MJU", "B0001I55O2", "B0016MJ73W", "0345526112", "B0062KMDWU", "B0050MB5AC", "B00005JKTY", "B0000AYJXV", "B00465I1BA", "B002TJ23KA", "B000YERP2S", "B00961ENYI", "0316058432", "B006WNSHUY", "B00I6JOBTI", "B005F96UJ6", "B00B98HG18", "B009Z4W140"], "bought_together": ["B000Q6774K", "B0013527I4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000Q6774K", "B00CUEIP56", "B0013527I4", "B004EPZ03O"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 8440}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 30.49, "brand": "Disney", "asin": "B0009ULBGS", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5121HCDPQKL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Muppet Show: Season 1"}
{"description": "He pops pills, watches soaps, and always, always says what's on his mind. He's Dr. Gregory House (Emmy nominee Hugh Laurie,Blackadder). Producers David Shore, Bryan Singer, Katie Jacobs, and Paul Attanasio haven't rewritten the hospital drama--at heart, it's a cross betweenSt. Elsewhere,ER, andC.S.I.--but they've infused a moribund genre with new life and created one of TV's most compelling characters. More than any previous medical procedural, it resembles Attanasio&#x92;s underratedGideon's Crossing, butHouseis lighter on its feet. As fascinating as he is, the show wouldn't work as well if it were all House all the time (that would be like Sherlock Holmes without Watson or Moriarty). Fortunately, he's joined by an intriguing cast of characters, portrayed by a combination of experienced vets (Omar Epps, Lisa Edelstein, Tony winner Robert Sean Leonard) and new faces (Jennifer Morrison, Jesse Spencer). Aside from the complicated cases they tackle each week, the sparks really fly when House's brilliant, if na&#xEF;ve charges are put to the test--and as the head of a teaching hospital, it's his job to test them (although his tough love approach is constantly landing him in hot water with Edelstein's administrator). From the first episode,Houseattracted a talented array of guests, including Robin Tunney (\"Pilot\"), Joe Morton (\"Role Model\"), and Patrick Bauchau (\"Cursed\") as Spencer&#x92;s father. In addition, Chi McBride and Sela Ward appear frequently (with Ward returning for the second season).

{"description": "Movie studios, by and large, avoid controversial subjects like race the way you might avoid a hive of angry bees. So it's remarkable thatCrasheven got made; that it's a rich, intelligent, and moving exploration of the interlocking lives of a dozen Los Angeles residents--black, white, latino, Asian, and Persian--is downright amazing. A politically nervous district attorney (Brendan Fraser) and his high-strung wife (Sandra Bullock, biting into a welcome change of pace fromMiss Congeniality) get car-jacked by an oddly sociological pair of young black men (Larenz Tate and Chris \"Ludacris\" Bridges); a rich black T.V. director (Terrence Howard) and his wife (Thandie Newton) get pulled over by a white racist cop (Matt Dillon) and his reluctant partner (Ryan Phillipe); a detective (Don Cheadle) and his Latina partner and lover (Jennifer Esposito) investigate a white cop who shot a black cop--these are only three of the interlocking stories that reach up and down class lines. Writer/director Paul Haggis (who wrote the screenplay forMillion Dollar Baby) spins every character in unpredictable directions, refusing to let anyone sink into a stereotype. The cast--ranging from the famous names above to lesser-known but just as capable actors like Michael Pena (Buffalo Soldiers) and Loretta Devine (Woman Thou Art Loosed)--meets the strong script head-on, delivering galvanizing performances in short vignettes, brief glimpses that build with gut-wrenching force. This sort of multi-character mosaic is hard to pull off; Crash rivals such classics asNashvilleandShort Cuts.

{"description": "LA BAMBA: The life of rock & roll legend Richie Valens bursts across the screen in this celebrated, music-filled movie with star-making performances by Lou Diamond Phillips as Richie and Esai Morales as his half-brother, Bob. LA BAMBA depicts the 17-year-old Mexican-American's rocket rise to fame, from field laborer to rock star with a string of hit singles and a date with destiny. Fueled by Valens' hit songs performed by the Grammy&#xAE;-winning Los Lobos as well as classic '50s tunes, LA BAMBA recreates the thrilling early days of rock and pays homage to the enduring legacy of a remarkable talent whose music crossed all borders. BUDDY HOLLY STORY: Gary Busey gives an electrifying, Oscar&#xAE; nominated performance (Best Actor-1978) as Buddy Holly, the musical genius from Lubbock, Texas, who changed the tune of rock n' roll history. With a groundbreaking combination of country music and rhythm & blues, Buddy Holly and the Crickets (Don Stroud, Charles Martin Smith) catapulted to national stardom in just three short years with such hits as \"That'll Be the Day,\" \"It's So Easy,\" and \"Peggy Sue.\" By the age of 22, Holly had it all: chart-topping singles, a beautiful wife, and international acclaim until tragedy ended a brilliant career but not his music. In an Academy Award&#xAE; - winning score adaptation, Busey sings Holly's greatest hits in this dynamic tribute to one of the most influential rock n' rollers of all time and the legacy he left behind.", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783114907", "B0009R1TJ0", "B000063JDI", "B0002VGTBQ", "B000E8QVWY", "B000P0J0CY", "B004DERXHC", "B0042837D8", "B000002LC8", "B0030ATZI0", "B001D0T4JY", "B00AEBB9IM", "B00005JND5", "B00465I1CE", "B008R65XOM", "B00158K0R4", "B0002VGTD4", "B00000I9CN", "6305428409", "B000RIWAVC", "B001P3SA94", "0916950794", "B0002O7XW2", "B0009OUBGK", "B00004RJ71", "B0001CNQX0", "B00005TQ44", "B00000K3TX", "B003GOP0D4", "630493629X", "B000023XRE", "B006X08ET0", "B00GLP8488", "B00008DDRU", "B0010YVCI4", "B00AMSS3TA", "B002M9WW62", "B00009PY4C", "B000FOPPCE", "B00BYS0XWC", "B0000DIXDR", "B00094ARN2", "B000YIGNHW", "B00009AOBI", "B00AEBB9ZK", "0825672872", "B000AJJNIG", "B009C30TLG", "B00AEFY4CG", "B001OJGJHO", "B00000IPG4", "B002O3Z4XE", "B000KF0GRW", "B00005LOKS", "B00009AOAX", "B0045HCJKS", "0790731533", "B0003JAOAY", "B00AEFY0F2", "B000QUUD5Q", "B00066FBRA", "B00478ED1S", "B000FTCLRG", "B00005JKS8", "B004CJQVO4", "B00CDWQNMW", "B005LOIDGI", "B005452D24", "0800177258", "B001CIOCRQ", "B00AEFYNG8", "B000BOH8X2", "0767821637", "0800141806", "B001U6YI8S", "B000065V3G", "B00006AUHQ", "B0002DRDIW", "B000JU8HEW", "B000O77LYM", "B00AEFY5TI", "B000LC4ZHQ", "B002GIBVVQ", "B00066FB2A", "B00008IHAW", "B001GJ4U9G", "B005OK0YVG", "B00000I9CO", "B000MNOX94", "B00GM5U80Y", "B000GW8RYI", "0767824555", "B00366BJAK", "B000EHSVSC", "0783225733", "6305213283", "B0000633U5", "B00AEBB9F0", "B0045HCJHQ", "B000KF0GS6"], "bought_together": ["0783114907", "B0009R1TJ0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0767821637", "B00000K3TX", "0783114907", "B0009R1TJ0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 12984}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 13.24, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B000A50460", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51YQjK%2B72kL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Buddy Holly Story, the / La Bamba - Set"}

Phoenix and Danes are a recently separated Polish couple in the year 2021 who find their marital troubles overshadowed by a spate of strange and ominous phenomena plaguing the Earth&#x96;-people mysteriously drop dead in their tracks, cold snaps threaten a new Ice Age, and in Uganda, citizens must anchor themselves to the ground or risk sailing off into space. Add to this confluence of oddities a subplot involving clones of Danes, a murder plot hatched by her brother, and Penn as Phoenix's eccentric sibling who periodically weighs in from a plane, and you've got an occasionally impenetrable (and not particularly romantic) picture that may baffle fans of the stars' Hollywood efforts. However, the cinematography by Anthony Dod Mantle is beautiful, and those inclined towards more eclectic movie consumption might find some chilly treats to chew on here.--Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001RJ1Y62", "B0010KP360", "B0000E32V0", "B0071HPP3M", "B00023P4N8", "B0013D8LCC", "B004P7CMVE", "B000V6LSOA", "B005DEUEW2", "B005Z9MH7U", "B000P5FH3K", "B000EDWKX8", "B00E8G5GU6", "B00067BBMI", "B000BQ5J2C", "B00BC75H5S", "B008PUI1GM", "B000ZS8GWQ", "B0045O2PHS", "0767805763", "B002UZCJ8Y", "B00BMKGZVA", "B00007JXWX", "B00190XKNY", "B000BM7YYW", "B004P7CNVS", "B004XVMCK8", "B00DMEBXDE", "B00AEFZ6V4", "B001FOPOD8", "B008220DIC", "B0055CP9SQ", "B00406UJWO", "B0010HOZLM", "B00AEFXE3Q", "B008ZQ4W64", "B000M53GM2", "1843583402", "B0000C504K", "B00368PSLY", "B00013RC7U", "B000LPS47A"], "bought_together": ["B001RJ1Y62"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000O76ZQC", "B00007AJFB", "B000EDWKX8", "0792842227"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 255118}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 20.23, "brand": "PHOENIX,JOAQUIN", "asin": "B000ADWDFC", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Q02MWBY1L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "It's All About Love"}

{"description": "Home to some of the world's best food and fashion, the French also have the wonderful habit of producing some of the world's best movies. WithHigh Tension, French director Alexandre Aja offers up a bloody buffet of terror; a violent concoction of style over substance, with a bloody French twist.       Two college girlfriends, Maria and Alex, take a weekend to study at the secluded country home of Alex's parents.   Shortly after their arrival, a mysterious killer appears, and things take a shockingly terrible turn for the worse. As the horror and body count rises, Maria and Alex find themselves fighting for their lives, and it's revealed that things are not exactly as they seem.     Essentially a one-act cat-and-mouse affair,High Tensionis an explosive bloody thrill ride that rarely lets up.   Oozing style in every color-saturated frame and boasting some intense performances, Aja mainly succeeds in sustaining an intense momentum throughout the film.  The plot occasionally suffers from a thin, flimsy storyline, and the abundant graphic scenes of violence will either thrill and delight, or simply disgust.   Nonetheless, this adrenalin-fueled addition to the genre gives the American slasher flick a real run for its money.High Tensionis high-art horror, and comes highly recommended.--Matt Wold", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001MEJY8W", "B0014VPFVS", "B00125WATQ", "B000EOTVU2", "B000GI3KGC", "B0009WFEDC", "B002EOVXBK", "B00GGY4R3K", "B001G9CNI6", "B00005K9O8", "B000WC38EQ", "B00009W0U4", "B000X1RYEQ", "B0041KKYCY", "B004AC6PV2", "B000EHRVP6", "B0028DRGDQ", "B000N3AW6G", "B005SQRYB4", "B001MFNB4O", "B000GSYRY6", "B000IHY9TS", "B000S0GYRU", "B00009MEC4", "B00187FPC2", "B001D2WU9I", "B0000CABGW", "B001B187L6", "B00G5GNYY2", "B008G1JIQC", "B001JV5BIA", "B002LMSWN2", "B000WC389G", "B0082A3HFK", "B002OVO18A", "B004P2VQZ2", "B00699G622", "B0009OUBC4", "B008JFUNYG", "B000FS9FE4", "B004EI2NP4", "B0013D8L7M", "B008NNY8XQ", "B000GI3RHY", "B00J81S92S", "B001D5C1OO", "B0031U8OEK", "B00196UTEG", "B006QWC2ZC", "B008WAM2E2", "B0015ET3YO", "B005J9ZFQG", "B000MM0LIM", "B00BSU0FQA", "B008BM5WQG", "B00AJLHUA8", "B000GLL1U6", "B003Q6D246", "B0083H6B0U", "B00006FDBW", "B001MVYUR0", "B000IMUYJM", "B00DMUFXOS", "B0021L8UPS", "B000099T3M", "B00CU00JTU", "B003L20IEC", "B0051CSIKQ", "B000NVT0TI", "B00DPUB5EW", "B001D5C1R6", "B00C7C00JU", "B000VKL6Z2", "B006U49SC6", "B0052DP1RC", "B00AZTUUQK", "B002DKGWSE", "B000FZEQWI", "B000RW5BZ0", "B0001611DI", "B0057O6IMS", "B00111YM5Q", "B00177YA6U", "B000UW8596", "B005ER6STG", "B0007WQHI0", "B00079HZY8", "B0009S2T0M", "B00005Q4CS", "B000PKG8TW", "B00006AUIG", "B000AXWHSA", "B001RTKKQW", "B003KGBISE", "B008G33PIM", "B004KDYR20", "6305228876", "B000PMLJMQ", "B002YICNE2", "B0060AAMEI"], "bought_together": ["B001MEJY8W", "B0014VPFVS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001MEJY8W", "B0014VPFVS", "B00GGY4R3K", "B000GI3KGC"]}, "price": 8.37, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 23934}, "asin": "B000ARFPMQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51K3uQHsEXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "High Tension (Unrated Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "Volume 2 of the stylish animated \"microseries\"Star Wars: Clone Warspicks up wherevolume 1left off, with General Grievous threatening a group of Jedi. The war between the Republic and the Separatists continues to rage, and due to desperate need, Anakin Skywalker is bestowed the title of Jedi Knight, though he must undergo one final rite of passage by traveling to the frozen planet of Nelvan. The action is at its fiercest when the Separatists launch an overwhelming assault on Coruscant, and Masters Windu and Yoda get to show their stuff to defend the city. However, it's just a diversion from the main goal: Grievious's attempt to kidnap Supreme Chancellor Palpatine. In the series' most dramatic moment, Shaak Ti and other Jedi try to fend off the droid's attack.Clone Wars Volume 2aired on the Cartoon Network in March 2005, and it's a bit more substantial than volume 1, taking place in five 12-minute chapters (nos. 21-25) rather than 3-minute chapters. And while volume 1 was mostly flat-out action, the developments in volume 2 lead directly to the opening ofEpisode III, Revenge of the Sith. And you even get small tidbits such as C-3PO (again voiced by Anthony Daniels) unveiling his new gold look, Padme sporting a cinnamon-bun hairdo, and the reason why General Grievous has difficulty breathing. Let casual fans content themselves with the feature films;Clone Warsremains essential viewing for the Star Wars aficionado. (Rated Y7 for cartoon action and violence)--David HoriuchiDVD featuresIn both a commentary track and a featurette, Genndy Tartakovsky and his creative team discuss the making ofClone Warsand how it ties intoEpisode III, Revenge of the Sith. If you're not a fan of the Lego Star Wars, you might become one after you watch the amusing \"Revenge of the Brick\" trailer. There's also the same Xbox demo ofBattlefront IIthat was on theSithDVD, and the Dolby 5.1 sound is an improvement over volume 1's 2.0 Surround.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0006Z2LMO", "B001GQSY5K", "B001GQSY64", "B00E8G5HFA", "B00E8G5H0K", "B0002YCUQ6", "B0002YCUPC", "B009OAWMLM", "B005J9ZFWK", "B004LROMT8", "B00003CX5P", "B00E8G5HDW", "B00006HBUJ", "B0057UA4FY", "B00005JLXH", "B0026IBRRO", "0345511298", "B0002YCUR0", "B008FTX6OU", "B000FAGGWQ", "B00K2CHWYI", "B00FX58Y9Q", "B00JMXWQ30", "1465408738", "1595826122", "B001PO53IO", "1593076789", "1616616806", "B005KR6NOK", "1783291044", "B00K7IPGS6", "B000067DPN", "B003ZSJ212", "B00004TN2T", "B007TM7Z6O", "0345493346", "1465420800", "1595826998", "B00GZ0ML4C", "B00ISDJUYI", "B00003CXCT", "B0089BSMKM", "B007GMKWYE", "B00E8G5H6Y", "0345477375", "B00K0MM4AM", "1452102279", "B000W4TGIQ", "B0012EM5CY", "B00AXFK96M", "B0001HAI0E", "B000JLTR86", "B000FQVX78", "0756663083", "B000FQJAIW", "1593079117", "B001LIYCDG", "B0044E9JTG", "B00IGVJH0E", "1593073070", "0345511573", "B000J3O194", "1616616873", "B00E9PMML2", "0553560719", "B00A8GBVOK", "B000FQJAJG", "B0095P8E22", "1616555513", "B009OAWMK8", "B00HWWUQYY", "B00078ZE7E", "B007IKKSNY", "0811868893", "B000VDDDVE", "B00GD9GNUS", "B00I19TXQE", "B00147F8ZA", "B000B3JX9U", "0345511522", "B00078ZE88", "B00CPEK3NI", "1593076800", "6305310254", "1595829474", "1593074832", "1593075677", "1593074026", "034550903X", "B00I6JOBTI", "1595826378", "B00HERGM86", "0345477642", "B008FTXQ8G", "1616552271", "B000067DPK", "1452111308", "B00JAQJNN0", "B004LROMU2"], "bought_together": ["B0006Z2LMO", "B001GQSY5K"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0006Z2LMO", "B00E8G5H0K", "B001GQSY5K", "B001AS94XU"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 27337}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 44.99, "brand": "", "asin": "B000BCE8Q4", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51F7C82EDGL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Star Wars: Clone Wars - Volume Two"}

{"description": "Nobody does comic existential angst like Nicolas Cage, who gets a good workout inThe Weather Man, an underrated slice of quiet desperation. Cage plays David Spritz, a Chicago TV meteorologist who knows only too well the constant uncertainty of predicting the weather. Despite a possible offer from a network morning show, David's life is a mess:  he's estranged from his kids and irritated wife (Hope Davis), he's perpetually at odds with his remote father (Michael Caine), and lately people on the street have had the disconcerting habit of throwing food at him. Director Gore Verbinski (Pirates of the Caribbean) has perhaps too heavy a touch for this kind of comic melancholy, but screenwriter Steven Conrad has an interesting, almost Mamet-like ear for \"written\" dialogue--Cage has a few voiceover monologues, including an uproarious sequence involving tartar sauce and a walk to the store, that are hugely funny. It's possible that we've seen Cage in this kind of character one too many times, but he's still good at it, and his doleful face and pasted-on smile fit the mood of the picture. Unlike the heroes of most Hollywood movies, David Spritz doesn't always--or often--do the right thing, but Cage makes you want to see the poor sap make it.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00012QLB4", "B005F2JRUC", "B00005JLRE", "B000JYW5DW", "B000BBOUW2", "B001J710Z2", "B000PMFRZQ", "B000GRUMRS", "B000CNESJO", "B000TGJ8CQ", "B00E8G5HNM", "B000BYA5G4", "B000059TG6", "B004EPYZOO", "B00003CXXG", "B000IFRT5Q", "B001GCUO02", "B00BTYMPX6", "0767810856", "6304806434", "B00006LPGP", "B002TVQ48A", "B002TVQ48K", "B001MLZNLW", "B00441GZ00", "B00000G02H", "B00008L3UF", "0792838068", "B00AEBB8JM", "B00BJB2GZG", "B004XFZ4JK", "B00062IDGK", "B000OVLBF8", "B007IUEEA2", "B000B8I9Y0", "B002GHHHKG", "B00IKM5OYW", "0792844831", "B000NA1WDQ", "076780676X", "B001JIE7JC", "B00005JLSB", "B0007P0X9G", "B00007AJF8", "B00C6F61HS", "6304711891", "B00005JL7Q", "B00005JK8K", "B00005JN5E", "B00004Z4WR", "B004SIP95G", "B00003CXPV", "B00003L9CH", "B00000JGHL", "B00275EHBY", "B00003CWTI", "B0071HPOV0", "B0015OKWKS", "B002VECMAE", "B00HUCF6KK", "B0039UT3LK", "6301971345", "B000EHRVOW", "B00AEFYAC0", "B000H0MKOC", "B005DCJ2DG", "B00007J5VQ", "B002ZG99KO", "B003102JDM", "B0009R1TI6", "B002CPMB9O", "B00BB67UNW", "B000FDEVA2", "B000CBCWRG", "B000066TGP", "B0013D8LC2", "B00020HAX8", "B00005JLO8", "B00005JLFA", "B001P3SA8K", "B002ZG980U", "B0045HCJFS", "B006TTC5MM", "B000DZIGDU", "B000H6SXSI", "B00AEBB9CS", "B000EDWKXI", "B000NIVJF4", "B00062IVM6", "B00009K011", "B0015OKWKI", "B009L79YFU", "B00005JMJG", "B0002W4UDE", "B000286RNE", "B002ZG983M", "B000UJ48SQ", "B000MEYFY6", "B00008EY9G", "B00AEBB9WI"], "bought_together": ["B00012QLB4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00012QLB4", "B000JLTRIQ", "B005F2JRUC", "B000JYW5DW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 132923}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.47, "brand": "Paramount Home Video", "asin": "B000CSUNQQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51JTWC5Y4HL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Weather Man (Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "A decade after their last hilarious short, the Oscar-winningA Close Shave, Claymation wonders Wallace and Gromit return for a full-length adventure. Daffy scientist Wallace (voiced by Peter Sallis) and his heroic dog Gromit are doing well with their business, Anti-Pesto, a varmint-hunting outfit designed to keep their English town safe from rabbits chomping on prized vegetables. Wallace meets Lady Tottington (Helena Bonham Carter), who appreciates Wallace's humane way of dealing with rabbits (courtesy of the Bun-Vac 6000), and sets up a rivalry with the gun-toting Victor Quartermaine (Ralph Fiennes, enjoying himself more than ever). Creator Nick Park, with co-director/writer Steve Box, delivers a story worthy of the 85-minute running time, although it stretches the act a bit; the formula plays better shorter, but the literally hand-crafted film is a joy to watch. Taking a chapter from classic horror films, a giant were-rabbit is soon on the prowl, and the town is up in arms, what with the annual vegetable contest close at hand. (Anyone who's seen the previous three shorts knows who saves the day.) Never content to do something simply when the extravagant will do, W&G;'s lives are filled with whimsical Rude Goldberg-style devices, and the opening number showcasing their alarm system is pure Aardman Animation at its finest. Even though there's a new twist here--a few mild sight gags aimed at adults--this G-rated film will delight young and old alike as Park, like team Pixar, seems incapable of making anything but an outstanding film.--Doug ThomasSee more clay animation and Wallace &amp; Gromit titles...Director Nick Park on DVDStop-Motion &amp; Clay Animation TitlesWallace &amp; GromitStuff Galore", "related": {"also_bought": ["B006W4KVI4", "B002DPVI0Q", "B001LXIDTK", "B00003CXJ4", "B001LXIDTA", "B001LXIDT0", "B002DR2GJQ", "B000M343BC", "B000W089WO", "B001OC6RZA", "B001F0TT8I", "B004AGN9MG", "B000AA4JNE", "B002ZG4QDE", "B000A2UBOI", "B003BJODIC", "B004KV93AI", "B00005JNQS", "B000H7JCK0", "B0072GOJ48", "B006W4KRRY", "B002WJI2QQ", "B0012EM5D8", "B002D755B2", "B0006JMLRK", "B0000640SC", "B004ZQJ5FQ", "B001DPHDCY", "0783231474", "6305161887", "B000MV9026", "B0034G4P26", "B001ECQ75A", "B0045I3EQA", "B000BITUVG", "B005FNLUFQ", "B000ION23A", "B007Z2DO0E", "B003XEKXWK", "B004HO6I4M", "B001GCUO7A", "B003TJM60G", "B000AY74OG", "B003E66Y84", "B00000JL8E", "B00005JMQZ", "B00009M9BK", "B000DWMYQ8", "B00003CXG7", "B0000AK7AB", "B00029LO0Y", "B0001906W2", "B0006UEVT0", "B00CWM58WY", "B000RMJ4F8", "B002ZG97YM", "B0019BI11E", "B0052MXJ3Q", "B0034G4P1W", "B000MNOX9E", "B004EPZ034", "B00DBVHHDS", "B00I6JOD2S", "B005LAIHW2", "B000IFRT2O", "B005F96UJ6", "1782760326", "B0039N74CW", "B0045ZAQS2", "B000BB1MI2", "B000UVKGPI", "B0030ZIZRC", "B000C3L27U", "B001PR0YEE", "B003UAKE9Y", "B005SDUV4E", "B001HN6918", "B003RHZ6IE", "B001FTIJS0", "B0013FSL3E", "B00CO9N6CY", "B000VBJEEG", "B00009YXAW", "B0015XWUAY", "B00AEFYXD6", "B00007LVCM", "B0034GK74G", "B0042U94UQ", "B00CHVJODE", "B00008G8LM", "B00A8KJK7G", "B000G75AZC", "B00005JN4W", "B000ROAK2W", "B005LAII62", "B00E00OGE2", "B007J3ISKK", "6305123454"], "bought_together": ["B00003CXJ4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0044RFTBA", "B002DPVI0Q", "B00I0VTOMG", "B001LXIDTA"]}, "price": 5.0, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 5628}, "asin": "B000CZ0PT4", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61MzjQMqG%2BL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Wallace &amp; Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit (Widescreen Edition)"}

Shelved by Miramax for two years,An Unfinished Lifewas released with little fanfare between Morgan Freeman's Oscar win and Lasse Hallstr&#xF6;m's higher-profileCasanova. Despite critical praise from some quarters, the heartland drama got lost amidst the shuffle. The title comes from the epitaph of Griffin, late son of Wyoming rancher Einar (a rumpled Robert Redford). Between chores, he looks after ranch hand Mitch (Freeman), who was mauled by a bear the year before. One day, daughter-in-law Jean (Jennifer Lopez) and granddaughter Griff (Becca Gardner) drop by the ranch unexpectedly. They're on the run from Jean's abusive boyfriend, Gary (Damian Lewis), back in Iowa. \"I don't want you here,\" Einar states flatly--he blames her for Griffin's death 12 years ago--but the look on the kid's face convinces him to relent. While Jean works as a waitress in town and embarks on a tentative relationship with Sheriff Crane (Josh Lucas), his newfound granddaughter helps to take care of Mitch.

{"description": "Film noir - literally \"black film\" - is Hollywood's moody vision of a dark, shadowy, smoky underworld populated by beautiful-but-deadly dames and the regular Joes who fall for them. These films are literally black in that they often take place at night or in the shadows - or both.But they are black in other ways, too: Shady characters with no redeeming or \"light\" qualities; likable people who mean well but are pulled into the dark world of murder and mayhem; and plots that focus primarily on the darker aspects of man's nature.Although films noir continue to be produced today, the heyday of these low-budget, high-tension pictures was from the early 1940s to the mid-1950s. Here are ten classic films noir that set the tone for countless \"black films\" that followed in their echoing, unsettling footsteps.DISC ONESCARLET STREET (1945) - Starring Edward G. Robinson, Joan Bennett, Dan Duryea. Directed by Fritz Lang.

The D.A. is worried that he and his wife are going to be blackmailed (since she's also a murderess), so he tries to use the gambler's sultry new friend (Scott) to get rid of him. (115 mins.)WHISTLE STOP (1946) - Starring George Raft, Ava Gardner, Victor McLaglen, Tom Conway. Directed by Leonide Moguy.

{"description": "Reese (Zooey Deschanel,All the Real Girls) is a brusk barmaid/actress, toiling away in the East Village fringe circuit. Her father is reclusive J.D. Salinger-like author Don Holdin (Ed Harris,A History of Violence). Reese hasn't seen him for years. One night after a performance, an editor from a major publishing house (Amy Madigan,Carniv&#xE0;le), offers $100,000 for the letters he and her late mother exchanged during their courtship. Reese turns her down flat. Eventually, she changes her mind and takes off for rural Michigan to retrieve them. She finds the disheveled, hard-drinking Don living with former student Shelly (Amelia Warner,Quills) and ex-Christian rocker Corbit (a disarmingly straight-faced Will Ferrell). It's a bizarre, if functional arrangement: Shelly cooks the meals, while Corbit serves as security guard. All try to make nice, but the coke-snorting, insult-flinging Reese won't have any of it. She just wants to find the letters and go. This turns out to be trickier than expected, especially once she actually sits down to read them. Directed by and adapted from his two-act play, Adam Rapp'sWinter Passingis the kind of well-intentioned independent where longstanding family issues are solved in just a few days (to the gentle strains of Cat Power and the Shins). Nonetheless, it offers the unique opportunity to see Deschanel and Ferrell,Elf's charmingly mis-matched couple, cast against type. As expected, Harris provides solid support, while Warner's clear-eyed Shelly is the true heart of the story.--Kathleen C.

{"description": "Executive-produced bySuperman Returnsdirector Bryan Singer and narrated by star Kevin Spacey,Look, Up in the Sky: The Amazing Story of Supermanis an exhaustive, nearly two-hour documentary covering over 60 years of the Man of Steel. It begins with the early work of Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster leading to the 1938Action Comicsdebut of Superman, then continues through the Max Fleischer cartoons, the Columbia serials, to the 1950sAdventures of Supermanseries and the tragic suicide of its star, George Reeves. Then it's on to the 1966 Broadway musical, the 1970s feature films (including screen tests of Stockard Channing and Lesley Anne Warren), the paralysis and death of star Christopher Reeve, the subsequent TV seriesLois & ClarkandSmallville, and the 2006 featureSuperman Returns. The documentary also discusses Superman's transformations during World War II, the atomic age, and the 1960s; events in the comic books such as John Byrne's reboot andThe Death of Superman; and obscurities such as a pilot forThe Adventures of Superpupand the TV-musical version ofIt's a Bird&#x85; It's a Plane&#x85; It's Superman.  Interview subjects range from two-production stars such as Noel Neill and Jack Larson (who were in bothAdventures of SupermanandSuperman Returns), and Annette O'Toole (Superman IIIandSmallville) to producer Ilya Salkind, director Richard Donner, Margot Kidder, Stan Lee, Dean Cain, and Brandon Routh. The animated series deserves more coverage, and some interviewees are conspicuously absent--no surpriseLois & Clark's Teri Hatcher couldn't find the time, but what aboutSmallville's Tom Welling?--but overall it's an impressive and engaging examination of the DC Comics icon.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B003ZHR6Q6", "B000HWZ4E8", "B000EU1Q3Q", "B000A5046K", "B000BT96FA", "B000I8OM94", "B00LT1JKN2", "1400068665", "B00EE8AJ50", "B000EU1Q2M", "B001OD8E4G", "B00E4Q6UVY", "B002K0WBDM", "B00AKK6MD4", "B000IJ79WU", "B000J10EQU", "B000AQOHNA", "B000ION23U", "B00DX88IL4", "B00G7QPX6C", "B000IJ79UW", "B000IJ79VQ", "B004EXWGJW", "1401247040", "B0049IHWYG", "B001DJLD2G", "6305943389", "B00080ZG2O", "B000OPODNQ", "B000BT96EG", "B00I40K6RU", "1781165998", "B0018BDDFE", "B00BBXSPES", "B00BBXSPCK", "B008MZZCZI", "B0007G89FU", "B002LWJ510", "B005G5NPD8", "B005DGKBDC", "B000TSTEJG", "B000Y5CJNC", "B00F4FFO8E", "B00HMOW9YM", "1449447155", "B00BBAQD6S", "B000OPODNG", "B000KWZ7JC", "B000PE0G0A", "B00006672S", "B000B7QCGS", "B000F4RH8E", "B008JFUPFI", "B0002ZMHX6", "1465408754", "B000BUE5D2", "1401241891", "B000051SH3", "B001ECQ5SY", "B00AKK6LM6", "B00DYEN6XC", "B00E4Q6U82", "B000PC8AKK", "B00GD9GNUS", "B000067IY3", "B0029WGIDK", "1563891492", "B002S3Y1LQ", "1401238173", "B0008KLVB4", "B00BVG7ETC", "B009M4KT3I", "B00BHLTIXQ", "1605490547", "B004EE2ZY2", "1401207642", "B00023E88U", "0811821625", "B004UQPM4E", "B008MILYYI", "1605490555", "1118341848", "B001F3FUK6", "0756620678", "B00A3THVGE", "B00GD9GNEY", "1605490466", "B00CENWUYK", "B000GYI33Q", "1401235476", "B000GRUMPU", "B003HKN548", "B003Z8ZCDO", "B00308B170", "B007MCSV1O", "B000O599W6", "B000LE17A2", "B003Q7B7BU", "B003F3NE4S", "B003XMKU0M"], "bought_together": ["B003ZHR6Q6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000HWZ4E8", "B000EU1Q3Q", "B000BT96FA", "B000A5046K"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 62876}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.23, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B000FO0AHY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/513SHSZ8VXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Look, Up in the Sky!: The Amazing Story of Superman"}
{"description": "Following the success ofLost,Invasionwas one of numerous sci-fi-themed shows that debuted in the fall of 2005.  But unlikeThresholdandSurface,Invasionhad the distinct advantage of airing in ABC's slot right afterLost, at 10 p.m. on Wednesdays.  Created and produced by Shaun Cassidy (yes, the former teen idol who also producedAmerican Gothic), the series starts in a flurry with a devastating hurricane threatening a Florida city and a 21st-century family happens to be in the middle of it.  There's park ranger Russell Groves (Eddie Cibrian) and his wife, Larkin (Lisa Sheridan), who's an inquisitive television reporter.  Living with them is Larkin's no-account brother, Dave (Tyler Labine), who blogs about conspiracy theories and aliens while between jobs.  Also living with them some of the time are Russell's kids, Rose (Ariel Gade) and Jesse (Evan Peters), who also spend time with their mother, doctor Mariel Underlay (Kari Matchett), who has also remarried, to the town's sinister sheriff, Tom (William Fichtner).  Tom also has a child from a previous marriage, sexy teen Kira (Alexis Dziena).  Amid the chaos of the hurricane, little Rose is the only one to notice a group of strange lights dropping from the sky into the water, then Mariel disappears only to turn up in a swamp the next morning, seemingly unharmed but now with a strange affinity for water.  Not so lucky is Dave, whose investigation of Rose's colored lights leads to the discovery that those lights have a pretty fierce set of teeth.  And what does the sheriff have to hide?  Parts ofInvasionfeel likeThe X-Filesor24, and obviously the central concept isn't new, but it has enough revelations and spooky chills to keep the viewer coming back for more. Unfortunately, even the plum slot followingLostwasn't enough to keepInvasionfrom being canceled after its first season.  The problem is that the season--and the series--ends in a whopping cliffhanger, which may never be resolved.  So before you invest yourself into a full season ofInvasion, be warned.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000FJH5M2", "B0051GOB2G", "B000E5N6B6", "B000N3T0EG", "B003PGNBO8", "B0037AGB9O", "B001CQONMC", "B000FIHN8O", "B0002S94BQ", "B001QE99BA", "B00465I156", "B00005JM39", "B000FS9MY2", "B001RXDM2M", "B002U0KHME", "B004XM38CS", "B002DQSKME", "B000ELL1QC", "B001715A92", "B00023BKMC", "B003LXM1PK", "B003R0MEYA", "B0009JE6G6", "B000EOTV98", "B000MMMTD2", "B00BHLTIXQ", "B000JLTRHW", "B0081QF6Q8", "B001RHGRTS", "B0055SNHQG", "B004LROMS4", "B002TQKL7A", "B00F3L8P26", "B0012IX35S", "B001A7GOCA", "B000067FP2", "B00062IDEW", "B0011FLH00", "B00404ME2E", "B008B4KVRE", "B000BCCAEQ", "B00IWTVDUW", "B0000V4910", "B007G4X7VC", "B000FUTVPA", "B00B04NIZO", "B00061QJSK", "B009ERK2UI", "B00CRX82LM", "B003LXM1B4", "B00005B8UD", "B000ATQYXI", "B00170LCWC", "B000NOKFGW", "B000ERVJLS", "B003H9LIU2", "B0012Z36F8", "B0056GLNQI", "B0012IXBNC", "B000MX7V66", "B00B4804LM", "B002USF1UO", "B001CY5N00", "B000E8JO2S", "B000BOH8Y6", "B000T9OP7G", "B000SMNL92", "B000092T3Y", "B002QU1Z1K", "B002BWP2IK", "B002ZCY872", "B001RTCP1U", "B0009JE6FM", "B008B4MMSK", "B00028HOMM", "B004HHX9T6", "B000F3UAE8", "B0007CEXUY", "B0011FLGZQ", "B003BV8I7C", "B0017IVHHO", "B008I34YOO", "B002C3GTLC", "B000QDLSR0", "B00ECXJC28", "B000E3L7F0", "B002QZDSW4", "B0015A5JVY", "B00022FWEU", "B004LROMWU", "B00E3QJ7JC", "B009AMAJBO", "B00BN0WQ5I", "B0009JE6FC", "B001B7CNZ6", "B002CLKP00", "B00HUPC5X8", "B001ILFUB4", "B002JVWRD6", "B0006UEVUE"], "bought_together": ["B000FJH5M2", "B0051GOB2G"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000FJH5M2", "B003PGNBO8", "B000E5N6B6", "B0051GOB2G"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 14808}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 11.0, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B000FOPPBA", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51T-WFfSTML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Invasion - The Complete Series"}

{"description": "Consistently solid with some major developments, the fifth season ofSmallvillekicks the characters off to college, but not before finishing the cataclysmic disaster that ended the fourth season.  With Chloe transported to the Arctic Circle and Kryptonian supervillains in town, Clark (Tom Welling) is in the Fortress of Solitude meeting Jor-El (voiced by Terence Stamp).  He gives up his powers, but to get them back will cost him the life of someone he loves.The even bigger development is that Clark and Lana (Kristin Kreuk) finally give up their dalliances with others and become an official couple.  That means the other girls in Clark's life become fifth and sixth wheels, so Chloe (Allison Mack) reveals the secret she's been keeping from Clark and becomes a best pal.  Super-gorgeous Lois's (Erica Durance, now part of the opening credits) banter with Clark loses its bite without any sexual tension so instead she meets Arthur \"AC\" Curry, a fantastic swimmer who has an eye for Lois and an accusing one toward Lex (Michael Rosenbaum) and LutherCorp.  He's not the only one; Clark's Central Kansas A&M; professor, Milton Fine (James Marsters) hires Clark to help him on his project, an expose of LutherCorp.  Lex is the pivotal character of the season.  His relationship with his best friend, Clark, now history, Lex has aChristmas Carol-type dream in which he sees himself in a law-abiding--and happy--life.  (That episode, \"Lexmas,\" also has some amusing interplay involving Clark and Chloe.)  Undeterred, he decides on a life of power and dives into a state senate race against Jonathan Kent with gusto, though a fanatical Lex supporter turns the race into a literal one for life and death.  Lionel Luthor (John Glover) also makes a strong comeback in this season, pulling unseen levers and making everyone wonder exactly what he knows.There's some fun.  \"Thirst\" is a tribute toBuffy the Vampire Slayer, and another DC Comics character, Cyborg (Teen Titans), appears.  Carrie Fisher plays Chloe's editor atThe Daily Planet, and \"Exposed\" reunites Schneider with formerDukes of Hazzardcostar Tom Wopat, and the two go peeling out in a vehicle.  But things come to a head in the series 100th episode, when Jor-El's prediction comes to pass and splintered relationships end up leading in unexpected directions.  Then in the season finale's cliffhanger, Clark has to face three of his enemies.

{"description": "Aliaswas a show that constantly reinvented itself. And its fifth and final season was no exception, as the creative team behind the espionage show worked to pull together the labyrinthine plot elements that had existed over the years, as well as tailor the show around the pregnancy of star Jennifer Garner. The results were somewhat tinged with melancholy as everything was wrapped up, but also had a maturity and respect for its characters--which is not to say thatAliaslacked in action. In fact, the season started out with a literal bang, as a truck slammed into the car carrying Sydney Bristow (Garner) and her co-worker and lover Michael Vaughn (Michael Vartan), right after Vaughn had made a mind-blowing revelation to Sydney. What followed was a mind-trippingly enticing blend of fake identities, false fronts, blind alleys, and new characters with dubious intentions, with the importance of the enigmatic Rambaldi device hanging over it all. Just another day at the office forAlias, you say? Not this time--for long-time fans of the shows, the true natures of all characters would finally be revealed, and Sydney would at long last discover the powers of the dreaded Rambaldi device, as well as who was behind the machinations to obtain it for world domination.WhatAliasdid best was mix its outlandish plotlines with accessible characters who were more than just pieces on an espionage game board. The final season did have a few false starts, as it juggled the departure (and reappearance) of established characters and the introduction of new ones, but by the time it had reached its 100th episode, \"There's Only One Sydney Bristow,\" battle lines were drawn as the core characters hurtled toward the show's conclusion. Not to be too cryptic, but the less you know the better, as part of the fun is puzzling out who's doing what to whom; suffice it to say that the ever-capable Garner, along with Victor Garber and Ron Rifkin as the dueling father figures in her life, laid a groundwork of personal drama that held the show together amidst all the shootouts, tech gadgets and costume changes. While (literally) everyone from Sydney's past made an appearance in the show's 100th episode (including an outstanding turn by Bradley Cooper as Syd's erstwhile friend Will), there were a couple great additions too: Rachel Nichols made a fetching Syd-in-training while Amy Acker, who played the daffy good-girl Fred onAngel, was a menacing and captivating adversary. We will answer one question for die-hardAliasfans: Yes, Lena Olin does return as the lethal Irina Derevko.

{"description": "Like previous installments, theLooney Tunes Golden Collection, Volume 4mixes favorites from the Warner Bros. archives with relatively obscure older works. Chuck Jones' \"Mississippi Hare\" and Friz Freleng's \"Sahara Hare\" and \"Knighty-Knight Bugs\" (which won an Oscar) offer hilarious performances by Bugs. Two of Jones' earliest films, \"The Night Watchman\" and \"Conrad the Sailor\" prefigure his use of subtle expressions in his later cartoons. The disc of shorts by Frank Tashlin includes \"Plane Daffy\": pigeon see-duck-tress Hatta Mari anticipates Jayne Mansfield in such later Tashlin live-action comedies asWill Success Spoil Rock Hunter?Not all of these films have aged as gracefully. Younger viewers will probably not catch the references to Charlie McCarthy, Bill Robinson, and other old film and radio stars. The Speedy Gonzalez cartoons feature ethnic humor that seems embarrassing today; it's also crashingly unfunny. Each disc offers a disclaimer about stereotypes, noting, \"they were wrong then and are wrong today.\"The discs are loaded with extras that range from a partial set of storyboards for \"Sahara Hare\" to three of the \"Private Snafu\" shorts, which were made for the \"Army-Navy Screen Magazine\" during WW II. The oddest extra is the documentaryBugs Bunny Superstar, which infuriated many of the Warner Bros. artists when it was released in 1977. Much of its information should be taken with a grain of salt.

{"description": "\"If it ain't broke, don't fix it\" appears to be the guiding philosophy behind season 2 ofAlfred Hitchcock Presents. Likeseason 1, these 39 episodes (totaling 16 hours, 52 minutes, and originally broadcast from September 30, 1956 to June 23, 1957) follow the established formula that made the series so popular, with self-contained tales of murder, suspense, and intrigue (mostly running about 26 minutes each) based on short stories from a variety of new and established writers in the mystery genre. (Many of these stories also found their way intoAlfred Hitchcock's Mystery Magazine.) By latter-day standards of intensity, most of these episodes play like tame, parlor-trick mysteries or single-room chamber pieces that accommodated the show's emphasis on budget-friendly production values. Still, modern-day viewers can readily appreciate the consistently high quality of writing, direction, and performance, along with the droll, playful introductions by Hitchcock himself, now fully established as a TV celebrity in addition to his global acclaim as \"the master of suspense.\" (Ironically, Hitchcock's first-season jokes at the expense of series sponsors are mostly missing here; apparently Hitchcock agreed to aim his humor elsewhere.) With the release of season 2, Universal has upgraded their disc format to appease fans who complained about double-sided discs in season 1; these five discs (eight episodes each, with seven on disc 5) are single-sided, double-layered, and neatly presented with no-frills menus and easy access to episodes. (Unfortunately, cast and credits are not listed on the packaging, which includes brief plot synopses on the inside slip-case.) Picture quality is uniformly crisp and clean, and sound quality is mostly excellent, allowing for somewhat lower volume on a few episodes (so turn 'em up). Another improvement on these DVDs is the inclusion of four chapter stops for each episode.As with season 1, the season premiere (\"Wet Saturday\") was directed by Hitchcock, who also helmed \"Mr. Blanchard's Secret,\" the season highlight thriller \"One More Mile to Go,\" and \"The Three Dreams of Mr. Findlater.\" It's no accident that these rank among the finest episodes (Hitchcock enjoyed the speed and economy of TV directing), but while there are a few misfires along the way, most of these episodes adhere to the smart, literate standard of the series. They're also an impressive showcase for new and established actors from the twilight of Hollywood's golden age: Seasoned veterans like Cedric Hardwicke, Mildred Dunnock, Henry Jones, Hume Cronyn, Jessica Tandy, Edmund Gwenn, and Albert Salmi do fine work here, and the relative newcomers include Rip Torn, William Shatner, Dick York, and Robert Culp, among others. Of course, no crime could go unpunished in '50 TV-land, so Hitchcock (in closing each episode) assures us that all criminals were eventually brought to justice. All in a day's work forAlfred Hitchcock Presents!--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000TXPXD2", "B000AL733G", "B002NPY7GS", "B005UL4NF2", "B00FEOYY8G", "B00LT1JKN2", "B001DXS4DI", "B003NOGNQU", "B0002CX1M0", "B006TBYC76", "B0007CEXUY", "B000H5U5EE", "B00KBES386", "B001HNDR4A", "B00JKTFQJM", "B0002NRRRE", "B000UVV25Q", "B00KTZALDC", "B003VJTGNE", "B00BQK4YDC", "B00HQLZCIQ", "B000A9QK7I", "B00IU6HQ4O", "B00BI3XZA0", "B00F6D62O4", "B00EEEHLKU", "B000LXGXY8", "B000BCKFXE", "B00308B170", "B000N2HD6O", "B0002HOEPS", "B000UYN9M2", "B000MGBSDK", "B009OE2NS0", "B00JEZWRE4", "B00CL0MCN0", "B002GSXKQA", "B0012KSUTK", "B000BF0C8E", "B0030BS1E8", "B008OIQZ36", "B000TJBNF8", "B001UDPA9C", "B00IXXVCT4", "B003CNQPMY", "B007I8KXQ8", "B001E6HUWK", "B0016MOWNM", "B0041SI7A2", "B000A1INJE", "B0019F030M", "B000XJD3K2", "B004IB04S0", "B000F48D0U", "B00009Y3RE", "B00BW4S87A", "B00GSMZ3I8", "B00D9EJFQY", "B0008ENID4", "B001JFKWE4", "B0012KSUUO", "B00KYCA4QY", "B00A4Y614G", "B000IHYXJO", "B0065N6KNW", "B00471JT0K", "B005JZBPJ6", "B00CL151ZU", "B00C6F61S2", "B00FRQ0GA6", "B00B00HUC0", "B00CL151P0", "B008MIYKS0", "B00JDCP0QA", "B008OIQYXM", "B00C7A8WNS", "B005D7E7ZY", "B000UX6TJI", "B0041SI7B6", "B002OID512", "B005D7E7PY", "B000ATQYWY", "B00092ZLDK", "B001SLNPSO", "B000O59A52", "B00CPR3RB0", "B0042RJWTW", "B0002HOEQ2", "B002DMJM7K", "B005PTYPK2", "B009OE2NZI", "B001D8W7F4", "B0012Z36FI", "B00005JO3P", "B0083TUEDS", "B001992NXI", "B001D8W7EK", "B005SQRYRS", "B00A6SZRT0", "B0000BV1XX"], "bought_together": ["B000AL733G", "B000TXPXD2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000AL733G", "B005UL4NF2", "B000TXPXD2", "B002NPY7GS"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 16535}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 30.44, "brand": "Unknown", "asin": "B000HDR814", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4172Q4BGN7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Alfred Hitchcock Presents - Season Two"}

{"description": "If Richard Donner's 1978 feature filmSuperman: The Moviemade us believe a man could fly, Bryan Singer's 2006 follow-up,Superman Returns, lets us remember that a superhero movie can make our spirits soar. Superman (played by newcomer Brandon Routh) comes back to Earth after a futile five-year search for his destroyed home planet of Krypton. As alter ego Clark Kent, he's eager to return to his job at the Daily Planet and to see Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth). Lois, however, has moved on: she now has a fianc&#xE9; (James Marsden), a son (Tristan Leabu), and a Pulitzer Prize for her article entitled \"Why the World Doesn't Need Superman.\" On top of this emotional curveball, his old archrival Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) is plotting the biggest land grab in history.Singer, who made a strong impression among comic-book fans for his work on the X-Men franchise and directed Spacey inThe Usual Suspects, brings both a fresh eye and a sense of respect to the world's oldest superhero. He borrows John Williams's great theme music and Marlon Brando's voice as Jor-El, and the story (penned by Singer'sX-Mencollaborators Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris) is a sort-of-sequel to the first two films in the franchise (choosing to ignore that the third and fourth movies ever happened). The humorous and romantic elements give the movie a heart, Singer's art-deco Metropolis is often breathtaking, and the special effects are elegant and spectacular, particularly an early airplane-disaster set-piece. Of the cast, Routh is excellent as the dual Superman/Clark, Spacey is both droll and vicious as Luthor, and Parker Posey gets the best lines as Luthor's moll Kitty. But at 23, Bosworth seems too young for the five-years-past-grizzled Lois. It's nice to see Noel Neill, Jack Larson (both from the classicAdventures of SupermanTV series), and Eva Marie-Saint on the screen as well. Superman Returns is one of those projects that was in development for seemingly forever, but it was worth the wait -- it's the most enjoyable superhero movie sinceSpider-Man 2andThe Incredibles.--David HoriuchiMore SupermanWatch our exclusive interviews with the cast ofSuperman ReturnsOther feature filmsSuperman in high definitionSmallvilleAdventures of SupermanSee all Superman DVDs", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001DJLD2G", "B000IJ79VQ", "B000IJ79X4", "B000IJ79XE", "B000IJ79WU", "B008JFUPFI", "B000IJ79UW", "B001CDR1FG", "B000ION23U", "B002GSXKN8", "B004EPZ07K", "B0000959N0", "B00005JNTU", "B004LWZWFQ", "B001DHXT20", "B000VI70QS", "B0006L0LOS", "B0007P0Y7C", "B000UR9T8C", "B00005JNJV", "B00005JMQW", "B00005JKCH", "B000AYELVU", "B004LWZW42", "B0090SI56Y", "B001OST0LW", "B001OST0M6", "B001QB9H1U", "B000HCO83Q", "B000PE0G0A", "B001GCUO1Q", "B0002IQMAM", "B004LWZWGA", "B008JFUS0U", "B000P0J06K", "B000OVLBF8", "B00E5I2MCM", "B003YAR97K", "B001GZ6QC4", "B00080ZG2O", "B003QO8TOQ", "B001FB55HQ", "B005LAIGW8", "B000I8OM94", "B000FO0AHY", "B00IZZDWKM", "B000P0J06U", "B0007V6ITE", "B008JFUO72", "B000AYELVA", "B002NXSRVG", "B00DYEN6XC", "B00E5I2MEK", "B000BT96EG", "B001HQZJMU", "B001QTXM5Y", "B00E5I2M6I", "B002HWRYJE", "B00E5I2M9K", "B001614E68", "B000059Z8L", "B001VLBDD0", "B000EU1Q3Q", "B000EU1Q2M", "B000KJU1KK", "B00BTYMPUY", "B000H30B2C", "B001F7MSFM", "B0013BM63O", "B00F4FFO8E", "B000EGDB10", "B00008G8M5", "B00JPS7HOA", "0790738953", "B000B7QCGS", "B000HWZ4E8", "B00BBXSPES", "B000FMGTTE", "B0083SBMBM", "B003Z8ZCDO", "B005LAII44", "B000P6XQ50", "B000VI28Z6", "B00AZMFJYA", "B001RHGRT8", "B000F4RH8E", "B002ZG99B8", "B001AK3S4Y", "B00005JL78", "B0002ZMHX6", "B0007G89FU", "B006VRRGNK", "B00BBAQD6S", "B009JBWOU0", "B000BT96FA", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B00BGI086Q", "B003UN2ICM", "B0000VCZMK"], "bought_together": ["B008JFUPFI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B008JFUPFI", "B00F4FFO8E", "B001DJLD2G", "B000IJ79UW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 57565}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.73, "brand": "DC Comics", "asin": "B000J10EQU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Ddmxk8VML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Superman Returns (Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "Winner of the Humanitas Prize at Sundance 2005,The Motelis a charming feature debut by writer/director Michael Kang. Between Kang and producer Gina Kwon (Me and You and Everyone We Know), this chronicle of adolescent sexual exploration shares the clean, contemporary look of Miranda July's film, and also Dayton/Faris's recent release,Little Miss Sunshine. Interestingly, all three examinations of humanity's awkwardness star nerdy, charismatic children. Punctuated by spare dialogue,The Motelfollows Ernest (Jeffrey Chyau), a thirteen year-old Chinese American boy whose family runs a roach motel primarily visited by prostitutes and druggies. Ernest's mother and grandfather strictly enforce their depressing traditional family work ethic, squashing Ernest's hopes of winning a writing contest that he has secretly entered, for example. As Ernest cleans scummy rooms, he discovers porno magazines and other evidence of raunchy sexual escapades. Intrigued but shy about his sexual prospects, Ernest casually enlists his semi-girlfriend, Christine (Samantha Futerman) to explore magazine images with him. Funny, touching scenes of Ernest with his little sister's stuffed toy bunny, to name one, remind the viewer of that curious age when sex is mysterious but tangible. When renegade adult, Sam Kim (Sung Kang), moves into the motel to drink and cavort with women, Ernest befriends him and takes tips. Eventually Ernest realizes that he's a gentleman as he begins to understand the subtleties of love. In this film marked by sincerity, one can't help but think of the protagonist's name metaphorically.--Trinie Dalton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000AI424", "B0013D8LB8", "B000YVBDJM", "B003M987PG", "B002JT6ALI", "B000UR9QTO", "B000BCKFHA", "B00009QGEB", "B000AQOHN0", "B00DNB1PNY", "B002C68WSW", "B000BRBAAQ", "1885030320", "B00008YLVC", "B000X1Z0C4", "B0000AGQ6W", "B001HB1K00", "B0006Z2NMW", "B008POPQWA", "B00COBWXIK", "0783229402", "B000H1RFPA", "B004BR7XGW", "B000BRBABA", "B000KWZ1RU", "B007I1Q512", "B001AXTUQQ", "B001O3W73A", "B002OR17Y0", "B00009YXEO"], "bought_together": ["B0000AI424", "B000YVBDJM"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0000AI424", "B0013D8LB8", "B008POPQWA", "B0000AGQ6W"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 63827}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.24, "brand": "Universal Music", "asin": "B000JBXHE6", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51BRwwDfw3L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Motel"}

{"description": "The Promisecame to American shores with endless hype about its visual splendor--and for once, the hype is deserved. Lush and luminous, almost every shot will make you want to weep from its sheer loveliness. A starving young orphan girl named Qingcheng is offered a deal by a capricious goddess: The girl will be staggeringly beautiful and have all the wealth, delicious food, and fabulous clothing she could ask for--but every man she ever loves will die. Thus begins a twisty tale in which a fleet-footed slave (Korean actor Dong-Kun Jang) and a mighty general (Japanese actor Hiroyuki Sanada,The White Countess) compete for the love of the adult Qingcheng (Hong Kong beauty Cecilia Cheung), while a vengeful usurper (Hong Kong star Nicholas Tse,Time and Tide) seeks to destroy them all. Like many of the classics of Hong Kong fantasy--such asA Chinese Ghost Story,Swordsman II, andGreen Snake--The Promisecombines the epic storylines of Chinese mythology with the headlong momentum and energetic editing of kung-fu action movies. The result can sometimes seem absurd to American audiences--though these same audiences will happily swallow the absurdities of American science fiction, simply because they're familiar with the conventions of the genre.

One night, it seems their prayers are answered when a customer leaves behind a suitcase in the club that contains the means for Rosso and Paul to change their fates. Rosso will take his beautiful, young wife Angie (Catalina Sandino Moreno) and their 5 year-old son Lazare to start over in a new city, far away.  Paul will escape mounting debt, an escalating coke habit, and finally be rid of his father (whom he despises and blames for all of his problems).

{"description": "InGridiron Gang, Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson once again displays far more cinematic charisma than one could expect from a former professional wrestler. Sean Porter (Johnson,Be Cool), a football player turned juvenile detention counselor, wrestles with a seemingly insolvable problem: The vast majority of young men who leave detention fall right back into crime. Seeking a way to give these not-yet-hardened kids a taste of self-esteem and discipline, Porter persuades his superiors to let him teach the kids football--and then take on high school teams. Though based on a true story (documentary footage over the closing credits reveals that some dialogue was lifted straight from the real Sean Porter's mouth),Gridiron Gangis pure underdogs-overcome-adversity formula. A formula is not necessarily a bad thing; when executed with skill and commitment, fulfilling a classic story mechanism can be perfectly satisfying, andGridiron Gangqualifies. But it's Johnson who carries it through, demonstrating--in the most unlikely of roles--a surprisingly gentle touch. Johnson manages to be manly without overbearing machismo, earning not only respect but empathy. --Bret FetzerStills fromGridiron Gang(click for larger image)BeyondGridiron Gangat Amazon.comMore Football FilmsThe SoundtrackOther Films about Underdogs", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000274T94", "B00AEFXOKO", "B000056VP4", "B000J3OTT6", "B00005JNEW", "B00016MSV2", "B00005JPBO", "B000A0GP0Y", "B001LGXIA6", "B00005JKE4", "B000EXZFCQ", "B000YGGNMO", "B001FB55NK", "B00005JPK8", "6305428492", "B002VECM6S", "B002NZK5QO", "B00AEFY17E", "B00004W221", "B002O3Z4XY", "B00008EY60", "B00AEFYJI0", "B00553K9IA", "B00AEBB9UU", "B000Q7ZNZ4", "B00BUC4TJ0", "B001T21QR4", "B0011VIO3W", "B0034G4OUO", "B0014QLEI6", "B003CWEQFS", "B000FVR1T2", "B0001MMGC2", "B009YQJ2Q4", "630529142X", "B000LRZHR8", "B00B83N2NU", "B00K2CHW48", "B004BFTFBU", "B000X5RBXG", "B00005JLRZ", "B007R6DJP8", "B002935GMS", "B001AEF6HM", "0792843592", "B000KLQUS0", "B00005JM10", "B00005JD5J", "B00BEIYLO8", "B0023UZBBI", "B000J10F14", "B000N6U0E2", "B0001US66Y", "B0001CNRS4", "B003SYQ7FC", "B00008MTYF", "B000HDZKLO", "B000F6ZIIS", "B000VG66XS", "B001BP4K22", "078324228X", "B00125WAWS", "B0009DWL8W", "B002VWNICM", "B00DI0135K", "B00005JLG1", "B0008FXT1Y", "B00120LPQ0", "B000FS9ULC", "B00006SFL7", "B00000K3UU", "1558908390", "6305505780", "B002CA68N4", "B00003CY51", "B001TUZGPO", "B00AEFYR3C", "B0062KME2O", "B00008977B", "B00E1HIXA2", "B00AEFXJY0", "B000KF0GWW", "B000CNER1S", "B000068NNU", "B000KX0HIW", "B002CAWNEM", "B00004Y2R1", "B0001IMCE8", "B000GAKDAG", "0060392983", "0780631234", "B002ZG96ZC", "B002C7ELWC", "B00BEIYN9Q", "B001BL96JI", "B009NNM9OA", "B00AEFXOE0", "B000G1R394", "B00004Z4WR", "B000R7G6H2"], "bought_together": ["B000056VP4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000274T94", "B000YGGNMO", "B00016MSV2", "B0034G4OUO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 20582}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.99, "brand": "ROCK", "asin": "B000KHYN9C", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51N1q49VJXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Gridiron Gang (Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "It takes a certain kind of comic genius to create a character who is, to quote the classic Sondheim lyric, appealing and appalling. But be forewarned:Boratis not \"something for everyone.\" It arrives as advertised as one of the most outrageous, most offensive, and funniest films in years. Kazakhstan journalist Borat Sagdiyev (Sacha Baron Cohen reprising the popular character from hisDa Ali G Show), leaves his humble village to come to \"U.S. and A\" to film a documentary. After catching an episode ofBaywatchin his New York hotel room, he impulsively scuttles his plans and, accompanied by his fat,hirsute producer (Hardy to his Laurel), proceeds to California to pursue the object of his obsession, Pamela Anderson.Boratis not about how he finds America; it's about how America finds him in a series of increasingly cringe-worthy scenes. Borat, with his '70s mustache, well-worn grey suit, and outrageously backwards attitudes (especially where Jews are concerned) interacts with a cross-section of the populace, catching them, a la Alan Funt onCandid Camera, in the act of being themselves. Early on, an unwitting humor coach advises Borat about various types of jokes. Borat asks if his brother's retardation is a ripe subject for comedy. The coach patiently replies, \"That would not be funny in America.\" NOT! Borat is subversively, bracingly funny. When it comes to exploring uncharted territory of what is and is not appropriate or politically correct, Borat knows no boundaries, as when he brings a fancy dinner with the southern gentry to a halt after returning from the bathroom with a bag of his feces (\"The cultural differences are vast,\" his hostess graciously/patronizingly offers), or turns cheers to boos at a rodeo when he calls for bloodlust against the Iraqis and mangles \"The Star Spangled Banner.\"Success, John F. Kennedy once said, has a thousand fathers. A paternity test onBoratmight reveal traces of Bill Dana's Jose Jimenez, Andy Kaufman, Michael Moore,The Jamie Kennedy Xperiment, andJackass. Some scenes seem to have been staged (a game Anderson, whom Borat confronts at a book signing, was reportedly in on the setup), but others, as the growing litany of lawsuits attests, were not. All too real is Borat's encounter with loutish Southern frat boys who reveal their sexism and racism, and the disturbing moment when he asks a gun store owner what gun he would recommend to \"kill a Jew\" (a Glock automatic is the matter-of-fact reply). Comedy is not pretty, and inBoratit can get downright ugly, as when Borat and his producer get jiggly with it during a nude fight that spills out from their hotel room into the hallway, elevator, lobby and finally, a mortgage brokers association banquet. High-five! --Donald LiebensonOn the DVD\"Global Visitings\" capturesBorat-mania in all its hype and glory, as Sacha Baron Cohen, never breaking character, promotes his film around the world. On the itinerary isLate Night with Conan O'Brienand the Toronto Film Festival, a now-legendary screening aborted after a projector malfunction. A mixed bag of deleted scenes finds Borat trying to bait more unsuspecting citizens, including an animal-control worker who refuses Borat a dog after he asks, \"How do you recommend I cook this?\" and a doctor who is nonplussed by Borat's obscene medical history. A supermarket visit offers the most maddening fromage-inspired looniness since Monty Python's \"Cheese Shop\" sketch. Also good for a few chuckles are a faux soundtrack commercial and aBaywatchparody (\"Sexydangerwatch\").--Donald LiebensonBeyondBoratAll things Sacha Baron CohenBoratApparelBoratSoundtrackStills fromBorat(click for larger image)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002P7UCJ0", "B005LAIHGI", "B0002ZMITY", "B002OID4WM", "B00020X852", "B000A88ESW", "B000WZEZGI", "B001G5T6GW", "B005LAIHHC", "B00AEFZ8OY", "B002P7UCJA", "B00005JNZU", "B001DPHDB0", "B001J9KJ4I", "B00G2P79BU", "B000J4QW8Q", "B00AEFYS2M", "B00005JMYI", "B002Q4VBPQ", "B0006GANPA", "B001OD4S50", "6305922756", "B003XJABTK", "B00AEBBA2C", "B008R65XNS", "B000BKVQS4", "B00AEBB9K0", "B003CRM6PA", "B000A7DVR2", "B00AEBB8FQ", "B0016MOV92", "B000BKJ762", "B00009W5CA", "B000AP04L0", "B008220BGQ", "B002T9H2LA", "B00068WOH8", "0385523467", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00008975Z", "B004SIP95G", "B00003CXZ1", "0783229526", "B002ZG99N6", "B003VPX5Y4", "B002SJIO4A", "B00005JLQN", "B00AEFY854", "B00005O3VC", "B004XVMCH6", "B000K7VHQE", "B0006HBZEW", "B00005JMUA", "B000VE439Y", "B00AEFXDO6", "B000EMGJAO", "B0000A02TZ", "B00005JNBQ", "B003Y5H5B0", "B00BEIYMZ6", "B004SIP8ZM", "B000MCH5RM", "B000K7VHOG", "B00005ALS0", "B001UV4X8S", "B00009MGEM", "B0001Z4OXS", "B000C20VPA", "B0012IWNZY", "B00CE00ZV8", "B00005QCVX", "B000I0RNVQ", "B000022TSW", "B001TOD92C", "B000P0J09M", "B00005JL78", "B00AEFYAMA", "B00AEFXGIY", "B000J4P9P8", "B000055Y0X", "B004EPZ084", "B001VLBDD0", "B00AEFY5B6", "B006XZWAWM", "B00005JKMN", "B00AEFY0F2", "B000XFVIOO", "B002GSXKOW", "B00006G8HR", "B000HT386M", "B000MQCUJG", "B00007AJF7", "B00005KA6V", "B004SIP9MY", "B00AEBBA72", "B00018D42W", "B000TZJBPQ", "B0009HBPN0", "B004P9UWM8"], "bought_together": ["B005LAIHGI", "B002P7UCJ0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005LAIHGI", "B000WZEZGI", "B002OID4WM", "B000TZJBPQ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 15271}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.29, "brand": "COHEN,SACHA BARON", "asin": "B000MMMT9G", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51uGbGa68JL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan"}
