{"description": "Two bored businessmen, exiled to a remote company outpost on a  six-week business trip, decide to enliven their visit by romancing a  deaf woman and then savagely dumping her. Slimy Chad (Aaron Eckhart) convinces  schlumphy Howard (Matt Malloy) to take part in the vicious scheme by framing it as an act of revenge against uppity womankind, but it quickly becomes  apparent that he harbors some even more sinister motives. What might  have been a simple exploration (some, no doubt, would say reiteration)  of straightforward misogyny is elevated by the remarkable performance of  Eckhart; at once charming and nauseating, his fascinating  interpretation of pure competitive evil dominates the film. Neil LaBute's  intelligent script is somewhat reminiscent of Whit Stillman's darker  moments (minus the collegiate cleverness and zany warmth), and his  direction, while rarely visually impressive, does connote the hellish  impersonality of corporate interiors with chilling success. The  director-screenwriter deserves additional plaudits for resisting  both the tidal pull toward poetic justice and the temptation to draw  either of his main characters as even slightly sympathetic. A study in  ugliness, a rubbernecker's delight, a time bomb.--Miles Bethany", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 535404}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.89, "brand": "", "asin": "076780094X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514R3NGHH0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "In the Company of Men [VHS]"}
{"description": "Anybody who has written him off because of his string of stinkers--or anybody who's too young to rememberThe Goodbye Girl--may be shocked at the accomplishment and nuance of Richard Dreyfuss's performance inClose Encounters of the Third Kind. Here, he plays a man possessed; contacted by aliens, he (along with other members of the \"chosen\") is drawn toward the site of the incipient landing: Devil's Tower, in rural Wyoming. As in many Spielberg films, there are no personalized enemies; the struggle is between those who have been called and a scientific establishment that seeks to protect them by keeping them away from the arriving spacecraft. The ship, and the special effects in general, are every bit as jaw-dropping on the small screen as they were in the theater (well, almost). Released in 1977 as a cerebral alternative to the swashbuckling science fiction epics then in vogue,Close Encountersnow seems almost wholesome in its representation of alien contact and interested less in philosophizing about extraterrestrials than it is in examining the nature of the inner \"call.\" Ultimately a motion picture about the obsession of the driven artist or determined visionary,Close Encounterscomes complete with the stock Spielberg wives and girlfriends who seek to tether the dreamy, possessed protagonists to the more mundane concerns of the everyday. So a spectacular, seminal motion picture indeed, but one with gender politics that are all too terrestrial.--Miles Bethany", "related": {"also_bought": ["6304143184", "0783231482", "6300182355", "6303506291", "6303212263", "B00005B238", "6300214060", "0790736233", "0783216084", "6303148352", "B00006AL1C", "6300268993", "6304508611", "0767825411", "6300183971", "6304509154", "6301300556", "6301670124", "6305363668", "B0000A36J1", "B000059HFB", "6300181286", "6300247236", "B00004RV8M", "B0000048TX", "B00000JQSV", "B00000JXVM", "B00000JGEK"], "bought_together": ["6304143184"], "also_viewed": ["B0087F7VSY", "6304143184", "6301792734", "B00000ILE6", "0783226152", "6301966732", "B00BBND56G"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 557907}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.95, "brand": "", "asin": "076780192X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/511NY005RKL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Close Encounters of the Third Kind (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]"}

{"description": "It's not exactly Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, but this 1998 entry, starring Vanessa Williams and newcomer Chayanne offers its own terpsichorean pleasures. The story centers on Rafael Infante (Chayanne), a Cuban &eacute;migr&eacute; to Texas, where he takes a menial job at a local dance studio run by John Burnett (Kris Kristofferson). There, he falls for Ruby Sinclair (Vanessa Williams), a one-time ballroom championship contender looking for the opportunity to compete for the title once more. The romance seems a foregone conclusion but has some snap thanks to a crisp performance by Williams and a sunny (if limited) one by Chayanne, a singing star in Puerto Rico. Best of all is the dancing itself. In terms of both energy, exuberance, and style, this film's dance sequences rank with the best of the decade's limited celebration of the kinetic art, such asStrictly BallroomandShall We Dance. Though the movie's central plot secret seems obvious from the first downbeat, the film takes off every time the dance music kicks in.--Marshall Fine", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000FUTVLY", "B004SIP9VA", "B004SIPAJG", "B0045DO81A", "B002H3EU9A", "B0009ML2UG", "B00023BLXK", "0783240279", "B004SIP9W4", "B00AMEZDJW", "B000009QOO", "B000FDFSGI", "B0001ADAWO", "B000ADS6DA", "B00AMEZDII", "B00004XPPD", "B000J3OTSM", "B0000DIXDR", "B001K2LFNI", "B0000AUHQD", "0767835174", "B0001CNRS4", "B00005JPK8", "B0002V7S34", "B000P0J0CY", "B00008973C", "B000002Q87", "B0068FYZES", "B00006ZXSI", "B004529NKC", "B009ANP4F4", "B002XLGOIQ", "B0012QCZ54", "0767821637", "B0017HEYDE", "076780421X", "B00AEFY4CG", "B002NZK5TQ", "B000HEWEE4", "B003UEYBPI", "B001F0TM2G", "B0001MMGC2", "B005KR6NS6", "B004SIP9X8", "B00AEFY5ZC", "B00AEFY5TI", "B00DMDE02Q", "B00AEBB8YW", "B00006HAWN", "B000CCBCAI", "B00AEFYHVO", "B00A4Y61ZU", "B0006GAOCW", "B00EOHGQPI", "B000XSWVEC", "B000Y11B8K", "B001132GNY", "B00BEL4QFO", "0783228058", "0767810856", "B003SYQ7FC", "B00AEBB8NS", "B00AEFXZJE", "B002GIBVQ6", "B000GDH9JG", "B0051HCUWI", "B002ZG988M", "0783231474", "B0000524E5", "B00006FMUW", "B000ARXF96", "B00D2UMHGA", "B000NIVJGI", "B00E0KWBE4", "B00AEBB9WI", "B006IRQUMQ", "B00003CXSM", "B00006HAYQ", "B004CYVZ4K", "B002D0L0R2", "B00006RZ9Y", "B00279MJHE", "B00AEFXZEO", "B002ZG9968", "B0006213IU", "B00DCG36LO", "B003Y5H58S"], "bought_together": ["B000FUTVLY", "B004SIP9VA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000FUTVLY", "B004SIP9VA", "B004SIPAJG", "B0045DO81A"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 9827}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.0, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "0767812387", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51imL8XXgLL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Dance With Me"}

{"description": "Lou Diamond Phillips leaves a haunting impression as the late 1950s pop idol Ritchie Valens, who made the Latino influence in rock &amp; roll conspicuous through his hit songs. Filmmaker Luis Valdez (Zoot Suit) creates a nimble, exciting, and sympathetic portrait of the boy driven to rise above obstacles of race and family legacy, and Esai Morales is equally fine as Ritchie's envious, searching brother. Great support from Elizabeth Pe&ntilde;a and Danielle von Zerneck as Valens's sister and mother, respectively, and Joe Pantoliano is solid as the singer's straight-talking manager. Valdez brightens up the third act with a rock &amp; roll show featuring, among others, Brian Setzer as Eddie Cochrane. Marshall Crenshaw turns up as Buddy Holly getting on that plane with Valens, and Los Lobos (who actually performs Valens's music on the soundtrack) has a nifty cameo as a Tijuana band that gives Valens a piece of crucial inspiration.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000P0J0CY", "B0001CNQX0", "B00000K3TX", "B00004RJ71", "B0002DRDIW", "B0000714BS", "B0000714BQ", "B000002LC8", "B003NF97NK", "0783114907", "B00180IPM6", "B00007J5VO", "B005HFI7IU", "B003E1QDAI", "B00004ZESY", "B000K2UGZM", "B000AM4P90", "B00AEBB9IM", "B0009R1TJ0", "B00005N89M", "B002WJHBCC", "B00AEFY5TI", "B000KJU15U", "B000063JDI", "B00465I1CE", "B000RHRGSK", "B002XUBDRY", "B00AEBB9ZK", "B003VA3JZY", "B00EE8AIW4", "6305428409", "B000GJ0LLI", "B0042837D8", "B0009IOR6Q", "B00AEFXZJE", "B0000DIXDR", "B004AOECXI", "B000K2Q7CI", "B0009HLC9W", "B00004Y2R1", "B00CAYH200", "6305428271", "B000065V3H", "B001GD6VTE", "B00441GYZG", "B001AEF6BS", "B0042EJDGM", "B000B74GCA", "0767821769", "B001D0T4JY", "0767812387", "B000P0J0C4", "B00009AOBI", "0800141806", "B000E8QVWY", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00005V9IA", "B0002VGTBQ", "0783228686", "B00006FDCD", "6305428050", "B00006RCOC", "B000N3T0HI", "B00AEFXP8K", "B00E1HIX66", "6305744793", "B00009AOAX", "B00008L3U1", "B00AMSS3TA", "B000E8QVBU", "B00005JND5", "B000ERVK3A", "B00081U7HC", "B00AEFY4CG", "B00AEFY5B6", "B0002VEZ3U", "B000FOPPC4", "B008IG0F4Y", "B001DJLD12", "B00003CXPS", "B000068TPB", "B00069FL7C", "B004IKZQPW", "B00158K0R4", "B000H5TH20", "B00AEFXPG2", "B00AEBBADG", "B001BGS16W", "B00003CXTG", "B0002TT0MI", "B0087F7VSY", "B0000AQS5F", "076780421X", "0767812182", "B002BIULKS", "6305213305", "B00004TJKK", "B00027JZ3E", "B00075VX2C", "B00006RZ9Y"], "bought_together": ["B000P0J0CY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00004RJ71", "B000P0J0CY", "B000A50460", "B0001CNQX0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 8913}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.99, "brand": "Philips", "asin": "0767821637", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51R7P26XWQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "La Bamba"}

{"description": "In this convoluted Western mystery, \"tall in the saddle\" is more of a genealogical clue than an accurate index of the hero's behavior. John Wayne has come to town, so he says, to work for a local rancher--who was murdered shortly after sending for him. Prime villain would appear to be Ward Bond, exuding oiliness as the local judge, who doesn't seem to be a real judge. Paul Fix (who cowrote the screenplay) and Harry Woods supply the thuggery. But mostly it's women that Wayne has trouble with: the dead man's genteel niece (Audrey Long) and her virago of a duenna (Elisabeth Risdon), and especially Ella Raines, who dresses like a man (well, a very pretty boy), runs the neighboring ranch, and falls into instant love-hate with Wayne. (This was Raines's glory period--within a few months in 1943-44 she was breathtakingly lovely inCorvette K-225,Hail the Conquering Hero, andPhantom Lady--but alas, here she's mostly just shrill.)As run-of-the-mill Wayne Westerns go, this RKO picture is a bit upscale from the fare at Republic, if also less robust. Edwin L. Marin's direction is undistinguished, but the RKO craftsmanship is handsome as usual, and it must have been nice to work from a coherent screenplay for a change. Gabby Hayes is around to discuss sexual politics with Duke. For some reason the veteran character actor Frank Puglia goes uncredited as Raines's enigmatic servant, who seems to have wandered in from a Val Lewton production.--Richard T.

{"description": "Edward Norton was nominated for a 1998 Best Actor Oscar for his role as  Derek Vinyard, a thoughtful kid turned neo-Nazi after his father is slain.  Edward Furlong plays his younger brother, Danny, determined to follow in his brother's footsteps.  The easy routes the film seems prepared to take never materialize.  It continually makes Derek's transformation both in and out of his racist beliefs believable and persuasive.  Stacy Keach is given the head vampire role of the local skinhead chapter, Cameron, and he's the closest this film comes to an overt overstatement.  Norton, however, is fantastic, embodying a person who roller-coasters through hatred like he can't wait to ride again.  His diatribes are not unlike what can be heard on any given conservative radio station on any given day, but he doesn't spew them as cant or screed.  Only when his violent emotions take charge, negating any sense or stand, is the underlying fallacy and nature of his beliefs made plain. This film was undermined by the film's own director, Tony Kaye, who made such a braying ass of himself and his work that it distorted the public's view of what is an interesting social and psychological lesson in the war between ideas and ideologues, reason and racism.--Keith Simanton", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303686796", "B00004W5UA", "B00000J2L7"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 321982}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.59, "brand": "", "asin": "0780625129", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516KFV9DGKL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "American History X [VHS]"}

{"description": "Coasting on the successes ofGods and MonstersandGeorge of the Jungle, Brendan Fraser turns in yet another winning performance in this fish-out-of-water comedy in which Pleasantville meets modern-day Los Angeles, with predictably funny results. Fraser stars as Adam, who was born in the bomb shelter of his paranoid inventor dad (a less-manic-than-usual Christopher Walken), who spirited his pregnant wife (Sissy Spacek, in fine comic form) underground when he thought the Communists dropped the bomb (actually, it was a plane crash). Armed with enough supplies to last 35 years, the parents bring up Adam inLeave It to Beaverstyle with nary any exposure to the outside world. When the supplies run out, and dad suffers a heart attack, Fraser goes up to modern-day L.A. for some shopping and long-awaited culture shock. More of a cute premise with lots of clever ideas attached than a fully fleshed out story,Blast from the Pastis also supposed to be part romantic comedy, as the hunky Adam hooks up with his jaded Eve (Alicia Silverstone) and tries to convince her to marry him and go underground. The sparks don't fly, though, because Silverstone is saddled with the triple whammy of being miscast, playing an underwritten character, and suffering a very bad hairdo. Fraser, however, carries the film lightly and easily on his broad, goofy shoulders, mixing Adam's gee-whiz innocence with genuine emotion and curiosity; only Fraser could pull off Adam's first glimpse of a sunrise or the ocean with both humor and pathos. Also winning is Dave Foley as Silverstone's gay best friend, who manages to make the most innocuous statements sound like comic gems.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005RIJ3"], "bought_together": ["B00005RIJ3"], "also_viewed": ["B00G5G7EXY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 277212}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.95, "brand": "", "asin": "0780626478", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/513Y40DFZ6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Blast From the Past [VHS]"}

This was Republic's first star vehicle for Wayne, following his breakthrough inStagecoach(away from Republic), and it's an uncharacteristically impressive production: good writers working from a W.R.

The story of a Long Island town whose summer tourist business is suddenly threatened by great-white-shark attacks on humans bypasses the potboiler trappings of Benchley's book and goes straight for the jugular with beautifully crafted, crowd-pleasing sequences of action and suspense supported by a trio of terrific performances by Roy Scheider (as the local sheriff), Richard Dreyfuss (as a shark specialist), and particularly Robert Shaw (as the old fisherman who offers to hunt the shark down).

{"description": "Although it wasn't a box-office success when originally released in 1958,Vertigohas since taken its deserved place as Alfred Hitchcock's greatest, most spellbinding, most deeply personal achievement. In fact, it consistently ranks among the top 10 movies ever made in the once-a-decadeSight & Soundinternational critics poll, placing at number 4 in the 1992 survey. (Universal Pictures' spectacularly gorgeous 1996 restoration and rerelease of this 1958 Paramount production was a tremendous success with the public, too.) James Stewart plays a retired police detective who is hired by an old friend to follow his wife (a superb Kim Novak, in what becomes a double role), whom he suspects of being possessed by the spirit of a dead madwoman. The detective and the disturbed woman fall (\"fall\" is indeed the operative word) in love and...well, to give away any more of the story would be criminal. Shot around San Francisco (the Golden Gate Bridge and the Palace of the Legion of Honor are significant locations) and elsewhere in Northern California (the redwoods, Mission San Juan Batista) in rapturous Technicolor,Vertigois as lovely as it is haunting.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300183513", "0783235593", "0790743213", "6300183580", "6300181340", "6300215741", "0783235607", "6304039530", "6305123616", "0783236352", "6301798503", "0792839846", "6302909023", "B0002IXSVI", "0782008348", "0800132009", "1558807780", "0783222955", "0800100832", "6304359705", "0790744589", "B0007939NO", "6305576173", "6301670159", "6301564456", "0800113055", "630150528X", "6301670140", "6301647734", "0783235623", "0792837614", "6304151306", "B00871C09S", "B000003KIU", "0792837649", "B00000J2KZ", "6301586042", "6300267938", "B000059HGY", "630281622X", "6302241103", "6303854311", "6304935811", "6300215512", "0792837630", "B0045HCJ9E", "0792107683", "0783235704", "6302641888", "0783235674", "630236325X", "B00000J2L7", "0783235615", "B00000K3AN", "B00005LMA7", "6300184919", "6301797973", "6300181367", "B00000FZXC", "6301798732", "0782006809", "B000005QWI", "0780614097", "630266232X", "B0000040EO", "630251018X", "6300208133", "6302278929", "B00000I1DI", "6301797906", "1558804226", "6300268594", "6305363668", "6300270386", "6303430546", "0800116917", "6304383177", "6302510007", "B000M7BEPQ", "B00003OSTO", "6301797957", "6301973410", "630442972X", "6301025083", "6304457316", "6304383169", "0792837096", "6304071876", "6302510031", "6300182304", "6302413435", "6302797667", "6302281849", "6301986059", "6301975987", "6304196954", "6300251152", "6300246965"], "bought_together": ["6300183513", "6300183580"], "also_viewed": ["0792839846", "6304429274", "6304117752", "0783222955", "6304539258", "0790743213", "6304457383", "6303215734", "0783216084", "B00BWJQEC6", "0800100832", "B00000K3AN", "0800132009", "6301792769", "6305123616", "6304039530", "6304151306"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 271884}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.43, "brand": "", "asin": "0783221088", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51JF1C6DF5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Vertigo (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]"}

{"description": "Director Martin Scorsese reunites with members of hisGoodFellasgang (writer Nicholas Pileggi; actors Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, and Frank Vincent) for a three-hour epic about the rise and fall of mobster Sam &quot;Ace&quot; Rothstein (De Niro), a character based on real-life gangster Frank &quot;Lefty&quot; Rosenthal. (It's modeled after onWiseguyandGoodFellasand Pileggi's true crime bookCasino: Love and Honor in Las Vegas.)  Through Rothstein, the picture tells the story of how the Mafia seized, and finally lost control of, Las Vegas gambling. The first hour plays like a fascinating documentary, intricately detailing the inner workings of Vegas casinos. Sharon Stone is the stand out among the actors; she nabbed an Oscar nomination for her role as the voracious Ginger, the glitzy call girl who becomes Rothstein's wife. The film is not as fast paced or gripping as Scorsese's earlier gangster pictures (Mean StreetsandGoodFellas), but it's still absorbing.

{"description": "Ranked 34 on the American Film Institute's list of the 100 Greatest American Films,To Kill a Mockingbirdis quite simply one of the finest family-oriented dramas ever made. A beautiful and deeply affecting adaptation of the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by Harper Lee, the film retains a timeless quality that transcends its historically dated subject matter (racism in the Depression-era South) and remains powerfully resonant in present-day America with its advocacy of tolerance, justice, integrity, and loving, responsible parenthood. It's tempting to call this an important &quot;message&quot; movie that should be required viewing for children and adults alike, but this riveting courtroom drama is anything but stodgy or pedantic. As Atticus Finch, the small-town Alabama lawyer and widower father of two, Gregory Peck gives one of his finest performances with his impassioned defense of a black man (Brock Peters) wrongfully accused of the rape and assault of a young white woman. While his children, Scout (Mary Badham) and Jem (Philip Alford), learn the realities of racial prejudice and irrational hatred, they also learn to overcome their fear of the unknown as personified by their mysterious, mostly unseen neighbor Boo Radley (Robert Duvall, in his brilliant, almost completely nonverbal screen debut). What emerges from this evocative, exquisitely filmed drama is a pure distillation of the themes of Harper Lee's enduring novel, a showcase for some of the finest American acting ever assembled in one film, and a rare quality of humanitarian artistry (including Horton Foote's splendid screenplay and Elmer Bernstein's outstanding score) that seems all but lost in the chaotic morass of modern cinema.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305123616", "6301797906", "6304119046", "630150528X", "6300183513", "6300181340", "0800132009", "6301720555", "6301975987", "079284517X", "6301971736", "B000006GCU", "0783235607", "6300181286", "0800100832", "6300270971", "0792839846", "6301976932", "6302909023", "6301977297", "6301976983", "0783221347", "6300182304", "6300183629", "6304117752", "6303560040", "6304429274", "0782008348", "6300181278", "6301976061", "1558807780", "6302226899", "6304151306", "6303257844", "0790743159", "0783236352", "6301586026", "1569942072", "6300214060", "B000006N70", "0800125762", "0790733935", "6302150620", "6303168507", "6301964012", "B00005LCBP", "6301773586", "B002NZK5VO", "630197350X", "B007Y1NR1W", "0790748169", "0446310786", "6300267857", "B00066FBQG", "0792133153", "B00AEBB932", "6304259131", "B00001OWYM", "6303020089", "B00003UCB0", "630310696X", "630021639X", "6301797957", "B00005NQGQ", "079212569X", "0767825616", "6301978633", "B00004TYS8", "6305718792", "0792108868", "6305050023", "6304383177", "B000EO7AIC", "0792108280", "6301661729", "6302529484", "6304457383", "0790731975", "6303382940", "0792844645", "0792116887", "6303269834", "0792837630", "6302843200", "630197333X", "B00003CXFU", "6300269310", "6301977815", "6300267970", "B000005PFL", "0782006779", "6303313345", "6300214435", "6301670159", "B000003KHS", "630027120X", "6304429711", "B0000040EO", "630157401X"], "bought_together": ["6305123616"], "also_viewed": ["0446310786", "6305123616", "0783235607", "6302226899", "0783221347", "6300215814", "0800100832", "0783216084", "6302909023", "630150528X", "0792839846", "0800132009", "6304117752", "0792837096", "B000FQJAIW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 157532}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.63, "brand": "Universal International Home Video", "asin": "0783222955", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51C084T8V7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]"}

{"description": "Winner of seven Academy Awards including Best Picture, Director, and Screenplay, this critical and box-office hit from 1973 provided a perfect reunion for director George Roy Hill and stars Paul Newman and Robert Redford, who previously delighted audiences withButch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Set in 1936, the movie's about a pair of Chicago con artists (Newman and Redford) who find themselves in a high-stakes game against the master of all cheating mobsters (Robert Shaw) when they set out to avenge the murder of a mutual friend and partner. Using a bogus bookie joint as a front for their con of all cons, the two feel the heat from the Chicago Mob on one side and encroaching police on the other. But in a plot that contains more twists than a treacherous mountain road, the ultimate scam is pulled off with consummate style and panache. It's an added bonus that Newman and Redford were box-office kings at the top of their game, and while Shaw broods intensely as the Runyonesque villain,The Stingis further blessed by a host of great supporting players including Dana Elcar, Eileen Brennan, Ray Walston, Charles Durning, and Harold Gould. Thanks to the flavorful music score by Marvin Hamlisch, this was also the movie that sparked a nationwide revival of Scott Joplin's ragtime jazz, which is featured prominently on the soundtrack. One of the most entertaining movies of the early 1970s,The Stingis a welcome throwback to Hollywood's golden age of the '30s that hasn't lost any of its popular charm.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00066FBQG", "B00023P4R4", "B0019UGYK0", "B000CEXEWA", "B00008OE4W", "B000063US2", "B00441GYOM", "B00079Z9VO", "B000MNOX94", "0783240171", "B002VWNIAY", "B00001W9G0", "0792838408", "B0008ENHUI", "B006FE83UE", "B0008ENHTO", "6305128952", "B00BTYU3SK", "B000087F6M", "B00AEFXD1O", "B00407PNY2", "B00003CXBU", "B0045HCJ9E", "B00004XPPC", "B00AEFY66U", "B000ZM1MG4", "B004SEUJOQ", "6304907729", "B00008CMSX", "B0010YVCI4", "B000EHSVS2", "B00AKGG5WG", "B000FZETR0", "B00871C09S", "B0049985XW", "B0068FZ0GK", "B00005A06N", "0783226039", "B003LMPKSQ", "B000W1SZBS", "B00AEBB932", "B007STBUHI", "B00005MEOU", "B002HK9IDQ", "0767818105", "B000XJD34I", "B00008K76U", "B0000JBALO", "B0052YDMZE", "B00006ADD5", "B0087ZG7R0", "B002M2Z3BA", "B00003CXB5", "B00AEFY9GW", "B003L16F7C", "B000EHRVOW", "6304712936", "B003ZEQMH8", "B000RPCK2E", "B001KXZGO6", "B0006GAO5Y", "0790731886", "B000KX0IOU", "B000I0QL82", "B00008UALL", "B00AEBBA0E", "B0010AN7Z4", "B000YDBPAM", "B004SIP7F8", "B0000AM6IY", "B000FO0AA6", "B000BITV92", "B002VWNIBI", "B001LMAK88", "B00AATUZLU", "B0000CBY1C", "B002VWNID6", "0783225733", "B001EJW0SG", "B00006RCO1", "B007Y1NR1W", "B000O78L00"], "bought_together": ["B00066FBQG", "B0019UGYK0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00066FBQG", "B000MNOX94", "B0010YVCI4", "B00079Z9VO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 30100}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 19.99, "brand": "Universal Studios", "asin": "0783225873", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Nmqp86vQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Sting (Full Screen Edition)"}

{"description": "Brace yourself: this is a clever, consistently entertaining, and even inspired continuation of the mean-spirited slasher series. For those not in the know, Chucky is a mop-top kid's doll come to life with the soul of a serial killer and the voice of Brad Dourif (doing his best Jack Nicholson). Revived by his former paramour Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly, looking every inch a life-size Barbie in stiletto heels and skintight black leather), Chucky proceeds to turn his human sweetie into a pint-sized Talking Tina doll with attitude, and together they hit the road for a magic amulet and young new bodies to inhabit. They hitch a ride with sweet young runaways Katherine Heigl and Nick Stabile and leave a trail of corpses bloodied, burned, and cut to ribbons. The kids are cute, but the real heat is generated by the latex lovers who use murder as foreplay and consummate their renewed romance in a night of passionate sex (\"Shouldn't you wear a rubber?\" \"I'm all rubber!\"). Hong Kong director Ronny Yu (The Bride with White Hair) directs with a light touch and against all odds transforms walking dolls Chucky and Tiffany into funny, energetic, full-blooded characters:l'amour fouhas never been more crazy. John Ritter costars as Heigl's overprotective uncle (another obstacle on the road to dolly freedom) and Alexis Arquette is hilarious as a lanky goth nerd. The wild conclusion leaves room for another high-concept sequel. The DVD features two commentary tracks, a behind-the-scenes documentary, and \"Jennifer Tilly's Diary.\"--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792836634", "6301961404", "630229648X", "6304136242"], "bought_together": ["0792836634"], "also_viewed": ["6301961404", "B0007GP70A", "B00DTPRYY8", "0792836634"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 306554}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.95, "brand": "", "asin": "0783229887", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/7161TVYJ6VL._SY300_.gif", "title": "Bride of Chucky [VHS]"}

{"description": "Released in late 1999,The Bone Collectorwas originally promoted as a thriller in the tradition ofThe Silence of the LambsandSeven, suggesting that it would earn a place among those earlier, better films. Nice try, but no cigar.The Bone Collectorsettles instead for mere competence and the modest rewards of a well-handled formula. With a terrific cast at his service, director Phillip Noyce (Dead Calm,Patriot Games) turns the pulpy indulgence of Jeffery Deaver's novel into a slick potboiler that is grisly fun only if you don't pick it apart.Noyce expertly builds palpable tension around a series of gruesome murders that lead us into the darkest nooks of New York City. Now a bedridden quadriplegic prone to life-threatening seizures and suicidal depression, forensics detective Lincoln Rhyme (Denzel Washington) gets a new lease on life with a sharp young beat cop (Angelina Jolie) who's a wizard at analyzing crime scenes. She does field work while he deciphers clues from his high-tech Manhattan loft, and as they narrow the search their lives are increasingly endangered. As this formulaic plot grows moldy, Noyce resorts to narrative shortcuts, using perfunctory scenes to manipulate the viewer and taking morbid pleasure in his revelation of the murder scenes. And yet it all works, to a point, and the cast (including Queen Latifah and Luiz Guzm&aacute;n) is much better than the material. If you're looking for a few good thrills,The Bone Collectoris a pretty safe bet.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEFXT1S", "B00AEFYF2K", "B00096S49Y", "B00AP2DC94", "B00011CZRE", "B002NZK5RI", "B00005JMWP", "B00AEFXEGS", "B00005JPD0", "B002GHHHN8", "B002AT8K9W", "B00015YVDG", "B002NZK5UU", "B00029RT9E", "6304884400", "6304765258", "B002NZK5VO", "0792159659", "B00009WVSL", "B000244GCC", "B002O3Z4ZW", "0790732149", "B00DHD933W", "B000GFLKF8", "B0050MB4OO", "B000OT6V0K", "B00AEBBA2W", "B0000VJG72", "B000JYW5BE", "B002NZK5R8", "B002AS464Q", "0790736411", "B00005JKWX", "B000QUCRB4", "B00006HAWN", "B001GKJ2E8", "B000CEV3M8", "6304711891", "B003ASLJIQ", "0767810872", "B00BTYOYG2", "6305428115", "B002AT8KAG", "0790730979", "B002LMV7R0", "B002O3Z4WK", "B00005JN0W", "B00006G8JD", "B00026ZD04", "B00004Z4WR", "B0043X1FNQ", "B005LAIGRS", "B00AEFYGBA", "B00005JLKN", "B004EPYZP8", "0800141806", "B0006HBZXS", "B0006GANOQ", "B000055Y0Y", "B00AEFYUQQ", "B000069HZP", "B00AEBB8LA", "B00005ATZT", "B002ZG997C", "B00005JA9F", "B00BTYU3W6", "0767803434", "B0021L8V0M", "B000244GCW", "B000ENC5YW", "B000R4SMCW", "B001KRVLCI", "B0045HCJFS", "B000P0J0C4", "B00000G3PA", "0783225547", "B00441GYXI", "B00AEFY4CG", "6304806434", "B00009L1TA", "B002GIBVVG", "B00AEFXYJA", "B002ZG99TA", "B0002V7OI8", "B00003CXGV", "B0050UEVNM", "0743491564", "B0045HCJ8K", "B003LR5BD0", "B00125WAWS", "B00000IQC4", "B0001FR3IQ", "6305718954", "B004A8ZX28", "B000G2YCVA", "B00005V4XV", "B001B3LIOC", "B00004BZIY", "6305767866"], "bought_together": ["B00AEFXT1S", "B00096S49Y"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AEFXT1S", "B00096S49Y", "B00AP2DC94", "B00005JPD0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 15287}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.55, "brand": "Universal Studios", "asin": "0783240295", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51H5Y1NXVWL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Bone Collector"}

{"description": "Robin Williams won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor, and actors Matt Damon and Ben Affleck nabbed one for Best Original Screenplay, but the feel-good hitGood Will Huntingtriumphs because of its gifted director, Gus Van Sant. The unconventional director (My Own Private Idaho,Drugstore Cowboy) saves a script marred by vanity and clunky character development by yanking soulful, touching performances out of his entire cast (amazingly, even one by Williams that's relatively schtick-free). Van Sant pulls off the equivalent of what George Cukor accomplished for women's melodrama in the '30s and '40s: He's crafted an intelligent, unabashedly emotional male weepie about men trying to find inner-wisdom.Matt Damon stars as Will Hunting, a closet math genius who ignores his gift in favor of nightly boozing and fighting with South Boston buddies (co-writer Ben Affleck among them). While working as a university janitor, he solves an impossible calculus problem scribbled on a hallway blackboard and reluctantly becomes the prodigy of an arrogant MIT professor (Stellan Skarsg&#229;rd). Damon only avoids prison by agreeing to see psychiatrists, all of whom he mocks or psychologically destroys until he meets his match in the professor's former childhood friend, played by Williams. Both doctor and patient are haunted by the past, and as mutual respect develops, the healing process begins. The film's beauty lies not with grand climaxes, but with small, quiet moments. Scenes such as Affleck's clumsy pep talk to Damon while they drink beer after work, or any number of therapy session between Williams and Damon offer poignant looks at the awkward ways men show affection and feeling for one another.--Dave McCoy", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000FVQLQQ", "B000P0J0EW", "6305144168", "B0043X1FL8", "B00000IQV7", "B00AEFY0F2", "B0000YEEGM", "B00JPQ1INI", "B004FQX5B6", "0800141741", "B00011CZRE", "B00AEFXESQ", "B00562D3Y2", "B00125WAWS", "0783226845", "B003ASLJQS", "B00005JLRZ", "B000M341QE", "B0034G4P7G", "B002ZG99N6", "B000N4RAR4", "0767811100", "6305428352", "B000P0J0EM", "B00009W5CA", "B002NZK5UK", "B003ASLJO0", "B00003CWQR", "B004SIP7VM", "B000B8QG22", "B00005V9HH", "B001F34HRS", "B004AOECXI", "B000N6U0E2", "B00AEFXYJA", "079284646X", "B0043X1FM2", "B00AEFY17E", "B000066HAS", "B000PHVZNE", "B003AWRMC4", "B00000G3PA", "B00AEBB9F0", "B00005JKWX", "B000MZHW40", "B000Z8GZYW", "B0018CWW5K", "B000P0J0C4", "B000P0J09M", "B00004BZIY", "B00B0U2SFE", "B003AWRMCE", "B00001ZWUS", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00005B6JZ", "B00005JLSB", "B0002ZDVEU", "6305428271", "B000FKO5QK", "B00AEBB9SM", "B00007GZR5", "B001SN78JO", "B000QQLVPQ", "630587493X", "B0001ADAVK", "B004WCTLNY", "0792843592", "B00AEBBA36", "B000FVQLRA", "B00AEFXXMI", "B000XJD33O", "B0002WZTOI", "B00004XPPG", "B00008G8M4", "B00AEBB9LO", "B000056VP4", "B006VRRGNK", "6305313687", "B0006FYOTC", "B001QERPAC", "B002O3Z4WK", "B001680M26", "B00AEFY4CG", "B000YDBPAM", "B0068FZ0GK", "0767836359", "B00005JN2Z", "B000765IJK", "B00008NFR4", "630471193X", "B002NZK5VO", "B000EGDB10", "B000068MBX", "B00000J122", "B00AMSLDTM", "B000MNOX94", "B000R4SMCW", "B00009AOBI", "B000XR9L50", "B00005JOC9"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000P0J0EW", "B000M341QE", "0783226845", "B002ZG99N6"]}, "price": 8.67, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 107799}, "asin": "0788814664", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51EQNMPT51L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Good Will Hunting"}

As with the firstBatmanfeature, director Tim Burton brings his distinct visual style to the frantic action, but this time there's a darker malevolence lurking beneath all that extraordinary production design.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000P0J06K", "B001OST0LW", "B001OST0M6", "B00005JNJV", "B004LWZWGA", "B001GZ6QC4", "B00005LOUK", "B000IJ79WU", "B001ECDVKE", "B000IJ79XE", "B0000959N0", "B0006L0LOS", "B000IJ79X4", "B000A9QKLO", "B00AEBBA72", "B0000VD04M", "B0000AC8LI", "B000IJ79UW", "B00008G8M5", "B004LWZWFQ", "B000A9QKL4", "B004LWZW42", "B008JFUPFI", "B000AYELVA", "B001CDR1FG", "B001AGXEAG", "B000J10EQU", "B001DHXT20", "B00005JMQW", "B002VWNIDG", "B004SIP9O2", "B004YJMQHI", "B0087ZG7NO", "B000AQOHNA", "B000AYELVU", "B00005JKCH", "B00GZ0ML2Y", "B00005JNTU", "B000UR9T8C", "B001VLBDD0", "B00DP9MDE4", "B001CK1D44", "B00AEBBAEK", "B000A9QKLE", "B007K3JFUQ", "B000VI70QS", "B00004Y87O", "B009JBWOU0", "B002GHHHOM", "B00005JKWJ", "B001QB9H1U", "B003UGLCIA", "B00007AJGH", "B0009UZG28", "B004SIP9P6", "B000035Z5H", "B00A2LFXVI", "0780630890", "B0000696I0", "B004EPZ07K", "B001OQCV6A", "B000VR0570", "B004EPYZT4", "B000OT6V64", "B001GCUO1Q", "B000RIWAVW", "6304698739", "B000O77SRC", "B000IJ79VQ", "B0014Z4ON4", "0780624890", "B004SIP6WW", "B005LAIH54", "B00003CY5Y", "B0000VCZMK", "6305869103", "B0001BKAEY", "B0090SI56Y", "B000068MBS", "B004SIP9MY", "B00AEBB9NM", "B0001GOH6Q", "B004LWZW4M", "B000GETUDI", "B000B7QCGS", "B000CSTK42", "B000FFJYBG", "B008JFUS0U", "B000RW3VCK", "B005LAIHYU", "B00005T7I2", "B0000B00KB", "B00E5I2M6I", "B001DTPZNY", "B004P7CN7W", "B001BGS17Q", "B001AJIHC8", "B005COPWZW", "B005G4TJUC", "B001QTXM5Y"], "bought_together": ["B000P0J06K", "B001OST0LW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002GSXKN8", "B000P0J06K", "B00005JNJV", "B001OST0LW"]}, "price": 8.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 142329}, "asin": "0790730960", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41SK0R2QFEL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Batman Returns (1992)"}
{"description": "Stanley Kubrick dissects the nature of violence in this darkly ironic, near-future satire, adapted from Anthony Burgess's novel, complete with \"Nadsat\" slang. Classical music-loving proto-punk Alex (Malcolm McDowell) and his \"Droogs\" spend their nights getting high at the Korova Milkbar before embarking on \"a little of the old ultraviolence,\" such as terrorizing a writer, Mr. Alexander (Patrick Magee), and gang raping his wife (who later dies as a result). After Alex is jailed for bludgeoning the Cat Lady (Miriam Karlin) to death with one of her phallic sculptures, Alex submits to the Ludovico behavior modification technique to earn his freedom; he's conditioned to abhor violence through watching gory movies, and even his adored Beethoven is turned against him. Returned to the world defenseless, Alex becomes the victim of his prior victims, with Mr. Alexander using Beethoven's Ninth to inflict the greatest pain of all. When society sees what the state has done to Alex, however, the politically expedient move is made.", "related": {"also_bought": ["0790734079", "0790705141", "B00004U8PA", "B00000FZCU", "6303953425", "6304484054", "0783235607", "6304039220", "630268644X", "B00006G8O1", "0790700506", "B0002G2B2W", "6305576173", "B000059HCI", "B00008X5J1", "0792837797", "B00000J2KZ", "6300267881", "6301977742", "6300216713", "6300269132", "B00000I1DI", "6302783356", "6300214826", "6305095566", "B00005JLET", "6302054982", "0800103106", "6302201845", "6302798450", "B00000J2L7", "6304994540", "6303686796", "B00005PJ8I", "6300216500", "0783228317", "6303107338", "6304935811", "B00004W5UA", "6302610702", "0783246641", "6300183211", "6302921058", "0792842111", "B00004T37H", "B00002E285", "B00003CXE6", "B000007OY0", "6301971582", "6300184064", "B00005LL26", "0790736039"], "bought_together": ["0790734079", "0790705141"], "also_viewed": ["0393312836", "0790705141", "B0013FSXT6", "B00GGAK0FS", "B008RO875Q", "B004O724M2", "B00004TLMC", "B00023NRSM", "B008M4MB8K", "6305440093", "6303953425", "6303939015", "6303148387", "6303861733", "B00003CXB4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 296220}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.95, "brand": "", "asin": "0790701022", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51EV1DQCCGL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "A Clockwork Orange"}

{"description": "Stanley Kubrick'sThe Shiningis less an adaptation of Stephen King's bestselling horror novel than a complete reimagining of it from the inside out. In King's book, the Overlook Hotel is a haunted place that takes possession of its off-season caretaker and provokes him to murderous rage against his wife and young son. Kubrick's movie is an existential Road Runner cartoon (his steadicam scurrying through the hotel's labyrinthine hallways), in which the cavernously empty spaces inside the Overlook mirror the emptiness in the soul of the blocked writer, who's settled in for a long winter's hibernation. As many have pointed out, King's protagonist goes mad, but Kubrick's Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) is Looney Tunes from the moment we meet him--all arching eyebrows and mischievous grin. (Both Nicholson and Shelley Duvall reach new levels of hysteria in their performances, driven to extremes by the director's fanatical demands for take after take after take.)The Shiningis terrifying--but not in the way fans of the novel might expect. When it was redone as a TV miniseries (reportedly because of King's dissatisfaction with the Kubrick film), the famous topiary-animal attack (which was deemed impossible to film in 1980) was there--but the deeper horror was lost. Kubrick'sThe Shininggets under your skin and chills your bones; it stays with you, inhabits you, haunts you. And there's no place to hide...--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300267881", "0790734079", "B00005ATQA", "6302038308", "6300182770", "B0009RRUKW", "0783235607", "0783228317", "B00000J2KZ", "B00004RNAC", "0790736039", "B00023NRSM", "6304508611", "6300182878", "6302921058", "6304509154", "0783216084", "6300214087", "B00004W5UA", "6301427076", "630268644X", "B000003KHS", "B000AMW2TK", "0790700506", "6300181340", "6300214753", "6302054982", "0784011923", "6305363668", "6303686796", "6305095566", "630021639X", "6302822688", "6305576173", "0783246641", "6304994540", "6303953425", "B00004U8PA", "0792158261", "0792100085", "6300213986", "6300189015", "630533577X", "6300214826", "0792846303", "6304288433", "6300147630", "0792842111", "B000007OY0", "0790741512", "6302158176", "0792846311", "6300183416", "0800103106", "B000005PFL", "6300183211", "0790733927", "6301666569", "6301871952", "0767825411", "630339406X", "6303109950", "6300216500", "6300214192", "6300262731", "6303257674", "6304214502", "630018627X", "6300214311", "1558807381", "0792839234", "0767819187", "B00005B238", "0790731975", "6303579388", "B000059HFB", "6302798450", "B00000FZCU", "6303651461", "6303566391", "6302642175", "6301971582", "6300218058", "6301094352", "6300184064", "6300181278", "6304457383", "6300214672", "6300262855", "0800125762", "6303257305"], "bought_together": ["0790734079"], "also_viewed": ["6300147630", "6300182878", "B00005ATQA", "6300189015", "6300267881", "B00023NRSM", "6300213005", "6303953425", "0307743659", "6303148352", "0790734079", "B001AQT0Z4", "6300183211", "0784011923", "B00BBND56G", "0788806270"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 268792}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.0, "brand": "", "asin": "0790705141", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5106FV0S4PL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Shining [VHS]"}

Burton's eye-popping, schlock tribute to 1950s UFO movies actually plays better on video than it did in theaters.

On video, however, the movie's kooky humor seems a bit more concentrated.

Corky St. Claire (Guest), an overwhelming drama director hiding out in Blaine, Missouri, thinks he has found the vehicle to put him back on Broadway:  the city's 150th anniversary play,Red, White, and Blaine.As rehearsals start, we learn of the town's history (\"the stool capital of the world\") including a brush with a UFO. The mockumentary follows the various townsfolk wishing for stardom: Parker Posey as a Dairy Queen clerk, Catherine O'Hara and Fred Willard as stage-struck travel agents, Matthew Keeslar as the town's bad boy, and Eugene Levy (who cowrote the film with Guest) as a dentist who dreams of glory on the stage. The film is a hoot from beginning to end, and be sure to watch the closing credits. Fans of Guest's deft dry humor should not miss his other parody of the entertainment world,The Big Picture(Kevin Bacon as a student filmmaker who goes to Hollywood).--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005ALS0", "B0000ALFVD", "B000M341Q4", "B00005NKC9", "6305922756", "B0007UC8Y4", "B0000ALFVE"], "bought_together": ["B00005ALS0", "B0000ALFVD"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 288595}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.45, "brand": "", "asin": "079073155X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51MCNQ0AY9L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Waiting for Guffman [VHS]"}
{"description": "In a time when it seems that every other movie makes some claim to being a film noir,L.A. Confidentialis the real thing--a gritty, sordid tale of sex, scandal, betrayal, and corruption of all sorts (police, political, press--and, of course, very personal) in 1940s Hollywood. The Oscar-winning screenplay is actually based on several titles in James Ellroy's series of chronological thriller novels (including the title volume,The Big Nowhere, andWhite Jazz)--a compelling blend of L.A. history and pulp fiction that has earned it comparisons to the greatest of all Technicolor noir films,Chinatown. Kim Basinger richly deserved her Supporting Actress Oscar for her portrayal of a conflicted femme fatale; unfortunately, her male costars are so uniformly fine that they may have canceled each other out with the Academy voters: Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce, Kevin Spacey, and James Cromwell play LAPD officers of varying stripes. Pearce's character is a particularly intriguing study in Hollywood amorality and ambition, a strait-laced &quot;hero&quot; (and son of a departmental legend) whose career goals outweigh all other moral, ethical, and legal considerations. If he's a good guy, it's only because he sees it as the quickest route to a promotion.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005V9HH", "B00AEFXN9G", "B000K2UVZM", "B0002V7O5Q", "B00AEFXESQ", "B00009W5CA", "B00AEBB9NM", "B00003CXZ4", "B00AEBB9N2", "B000KWZ7JC", "B000HC2LHG", "B00011CZRE", "0446674249", "0767830555", "B0006GANN2", "B00005JKJA", "B004SIP95G", "B00HJRVWM2", "B000055Y0Y", "B00AEFY5B6", "B000P0J0EW", "B005S9ELVC", "0767802519", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00005PJ8T", "B000P0J0AG", "B00005ATZT", "B002DU39GW", "B003AWRMCE", "6304698747", "B0006GAOJA", "6305308837", "B003ELKNH2", "B004FQX5B6", "0790732149", "B004U7MR14", "B000LP6KNU", "B000FFJYA2", "B000C20VRS", "B00005AUK9", "B0002XNT12", "B003XURDAY", "B00079Z9VO", "B0002HOERG", "B00008975Z", "B000O77SRC", "B00AEFYUQQ", "B000A2UBN4", "B0000AM6JI", "B00BTYOYG2", "B000M341QE", "B0045HCJ9E", "B003ASLJQ8", "B002VWNIAY", "B004SIP7TE", "079284646X", "B004AOECXI", "B000063US2", "B002NZK5VO", "B00005JLRE", "B0087ZG7OI", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00003CWUX", "B0010YSD8Q", "B00006FMAT", "B000P0J09M", "B000A7DVR2", "6305262268", "B003L20IG0", "B00066FBQG", "B00AEBB95K", "B004SIP7F8", "B000GIW9I2", "6305999872", "0767817710", "B000XR9L50", "B00080ZG10", "B00005BCKF", "B000PAAJZ6", "B002T9H2LA", "B000GFLKF8", "B00LG6YEKE", "B000LC55F2", "6305263248", "B0087ZG7R0", "B000CEXEWA", "6305161879", "B000P0J0D8", "0792833279", "B00008OE4W", "B00004XPPB", "B007UW9W5U", "B0045HCJIK", "B00005JMEW", "B00AEBB9UK", "6305428115", "B004SIP9Z6", "B004SIP7ZS", "B0000DI87S", "B00B0U2SFE"], "bought_together": ["B00005V9HH", "B00009W5CA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00GHJ1YUI", "B00005V9HH", "B007NPYP24", "B00003CWL6"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 51121}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.89, "brand": "", "asin": "0790734850", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51R182THC0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "L.A.

But there's more to this 1983 hit than the arrival of a hot young star. Making a stylish debut, writer-director Paul Brickman crafted a subtle satire of crass materialism wrapped in an irresistible plot about a crafty high schooler named Joel (Cruise) who goes into risky business with the beguiling prostitute Lana (Rebecca De Mornay) while his parents are out of town. Joel turns his affluent Chicago-suburb home into a lucrative bordello and forms a steamy personal and professional partnership with Lana, but only as long as the two can avoid the vengeful pimp Guido (Joe Pantoliano) and keep their customers happy.

{"description": "This romantic, witty, and ultimately poignant glimpse at two strangers (Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy) who share thoughts, affections, and past experiences during one 14-hour tryst in Vienna somehow remains writer/director Richard Linklater's  (Dazed and Confused,Slacker) most overlooked gem. Delpy, a stunning, low-key Parisian, meets the stammering American Hawke, as the two share a Eurorail seat--she's starting school in Paris, he's finishing a vacation. Their mutual attraction leads to an awkward meeting (beautifully played by each performer), and Hawke suggests that Delpy spend his remaining 14 hours in Vienna with him.Typically, this skeleton is as much plot as Linklater provides; as usual, he's more interested in concentrating his talents on observing the casual, playful conversations between his leads. His tight time frame allows the characters to say anything to one another, and topics ranging from politics to past romances to fears of the future flow with subtle finesse. The short time frame is also cruel, however, because beneath this love affair lies the painful reality that the two most likely will never see each other again and will be left only with memories--an idea Linklater drives home with an effective snapshot conclusion.Hardly the trite Gen-X bitch session that many '90s films using this approach become, the film feels more like a Bresson or Rohmer piece, containing sharp perceptions--and flawed humans rather than stereotypes. The protagonists' frank revelations and heated exchanges flow in a stream-of-consciousness style, and its no accident that Linklater set the film in Vienna, where Freud invented and practiced psychotherapy.--Dave McCoy", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0002Z0EYU", "B0002YLC24"], "bought_together": ["B0002Z0EYU"]}, "price": 29.95, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 540185}, "asin": "079073382X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Z7RQ7GT4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Before Sunrise [VHS]"}

Since Meinheimer believes in promoting alternative energy resources, the evil leaders of the polluting energy industries (coal, oil, and nuclear power-or the lobby groups SMOKE, SPILL and KABOOM) are horrified at Bush's choice. Joining together with arch-villain Quentin Hapsburg (Robert Goulet), they plan to kidnap the real Meinheimer and substitute a fake Meinheimer in his place who will enact energy policy according to the dictates of the energy lobby. Drebin becomes deeply involved in the conspiracy when he runs into his ex-girl friend Jane (Priscilla Presley), who is not only Meinheimer's public relations director but also Hapsburg's current paramour.", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792166523", "B00AEFYPAC", "6305428263", "B00AEFYP3E", "B000H7JCFK", "B00AEFXDO6", "B00AEFXDAK", "B00005JXY3", "079073849X", "B00BTYFWEA", "B00005PJ6M", "B002GSXKPG", "B000G6BLW4", "B00AJCUL1C", "B00AMSQBRQ", "B000067J1Y", "B0001ZX0O2", "B000K405CY", "B000067J1Z", "B00GT83J1E", "6305308802", "B0009PVZD2", "B0000VD11E", "B0000A02TZ", "0783226926", "B000Z8GZYW", "B00AEBB99Q", "B00005JO3P", "B000EGDB10", "B0018QPPXW", "B0002J58HO", "B000O77SRM", "B00441GYQ0", "B0015XHQT4", "0790742012", "B004SIP9Z6", "B00008DDXA", "B00AEFXDGE", "B007P9HW3M", "0783242263", "B002O3Z4YI", "B0045HCJG2", "B00AEFXJS6", "B00407PO3W", "B00005QT9P", "B004RA7YW6", "B003ASLJMM", "B0000A14TA", "B00005JN5T", "0792844890", "B00441GZ2S", "B000O77SRC", "B00CAAU39G", "B00005N5SA", "0783223609", "B000FOPPDI", "B000EHSVOG", "0790732157", "B0000WN0UU", "B00005U5A8", "B00CNIDGXK", "B0000VV508", "B0087ZG7Q6", "B002PQKNR2", "B005NKIPUO", "B00AEFYR9G", "B00CXYCBNA", "B00DX88J9A", "B00004TJMW", "B000A2UBNE", "B00005JKCB", "B003CRM6PA", "B005S9EJVY", "6304696221", "B0002CHK1S", "B002GHHHME", "B003KV3E36", "B0083XXVFW", "B0009HLD4Q", "B001IKKMCW", "B00005N7Z1", "B002ZD3V10", "B000VBIGD6", "B0006GANPA", "0792844866", "B004ALIG0G", "B001FB55HQ", "B001ECDVJU", "B0001Z4OXS", "B000E33W1W", "B00H83EUQW", "B0000AVH9Q", "B00158K0QU", "B00004RJ73", "B000P0J06K", "B0008JIJ2O", "B0007TKNM4", "B0000DZTOM", "B0009HBPN0", "B00006RCOC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0792166469", "B00AEFXDO6", "B00AMSQBUI", "B0001Z4OXS"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 180050}, "asin": "0792166493", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51R8PHDGQDL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Naked Gun 2 1/2 - The Smell of Fear"}

{"description": "The great improvisational comedy team of Mike Nichols and Elaine May reunited to (respectively) direct and write this update of the French comedyLa Cage Aux Folles. Robin Williams stars as a gay Miami nightclub owner who is forced to play it straight and ask his drag-queen partner (Nathan Lane) to hide out when Williams's son invites his prospective--and highly conservative--in-laws and fianc&eacute;e to a meet-and-greet dinner party. Gene Hackman and Dianne Wiest play the straight-laced senator and his wife, and Calista Flockhart (from television'sAlly McBeal) plays their daughter in a culture-clash with outrageous consequences. May's witty screenplay incorporates some pointed observations about the political landscape of the 1990s and takes a sensitive approach to the comedy's underlying drama. Topping off the action is Hank Azaria in a scene-stealing role as Williams's and Lane's flamboyant housekeeper, &quot;Agador Spartacus.&quot;--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000714BP", "B000QQLVPQ", "B00DW5IJR6", "0792843983", "B00EPH8SBM", "B0001HAGRE", "B00005BKZP", "B000ZM1MG4", "B004VJJGFG", "B007XTDWKQ", "B000EHRVOW", "B00081U7HC", "6305127670", "B000SFOW8I", "6305236569", "0783226772", "B0045HCJIK", "6305161879", "0783227396", "0800141849", "B00066FBQG", "078322740X", "6305609764", "B000B8QG22", "B0045HCJGW", "B000EGDB10", "B000056PMU", "B00003CWN3", "B00005JOFQ", "B000YDBPAM", "B0000AOV4I", "B00009W5CA", "B0000YEEGM", "B003Y5H5B0", "B00AEFXXMI", "B00005A06N", "B00386EZKE", "B00466HN7M", "B00GHP8SH4", "B000ELJAEM", "B001ECDVJU", "B002OOWKYE", "B00009WVSL", "B0001AVZA8", "B000K7VHLY", "B004EPYZUS", "B009NYF2GQ", "6305212112", "B0045HCJ80", "6305133468", "B008R65XMO", "B000LP6KNU", "B00AEFYRJQ", "B0000JBALO", "0784011710", "B00006FMUW", "B00008979E", "B00F98FOPE", "B0030ATZH6", "B0037XPPAM", "0800141806", "B00AEFXTKO", "B00AEFXT1S", "B000TXP56C", "B0041QSZS8", "B0002WZTOI", "B00004TJKK", "B00004RJ73", "B0038N9WKU", "B002JCSWV6", "B004A8ZWVK", "B00079Z9VO", "B00005ALS0", "B00AMSS3TA", "B004SEUJK0", "B0001ZX0O2", "630587493X", "0783227388", "B003ASLJQ8", "B000BT970O", "6305433909", "B0045HCJSA", "B002O3Z50G", "B0000CBY1C", "B002NZK5RS", "0790742071", "B00028HBIO", "B0007IO6NM", "0800177991", "B007N31YH0", "B0009DWL8W", "B00IA7MFEO", "B0000DIXDR", "6304711905", "B00COHGPD8", "B001P3SA94", "B0001Z4OXS", "B001VLBDD0", "B002NZK5V4", "B00JAQJMJ0"], "bought_together": ["B0000714BP", "B00EPH8SBM"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0000714BP", "B0015RRN84", "0792843983"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 2129}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.67, "brand": "Mgm/Ua Studios", "asin": "0792833198", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51AJN9TDTWL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Birdcage"}
{"description": "If you can stifle the urge to laugh at its pastel unisex costumes and futuristic shopping-mall d&eacute;cor, this extravagant science fiction film from 1976 is still visually fascinating and provocatively entertaining. Set in the year 2274, when ecological disaster has driven civilization to the protection of domed cities, the story revolves around a society that holds a ceremonial death ritual for all citizens who reach the age of 30. In a diseaseless city where free sex is encouraged and old age is virtually unknown, Logan (Michael York) is a \"sandman,\" one who enforces this radical method of population control (but he's about to turn 30 and he doesn't want to die). Escaping from the domed city via a network of underground passages, Logan is joined by another \"runner\" named Jessica (Jenny Agutter), while his former sandman partner (Richard Jordan) is determined to terminate Logan's rebellion. Using a variety of splendid matte paintings and miniatures,Logan's Runearned a special Oscar for visual effects (images of a long-abandoned Washington, D.C., are particularly impressive), and in addition to fine performances by Jordan and Peter Ustinov, the film features '70s poster babe Farrah Fawcett in a cheesy supporting role. Jerry Goldsmith's semi-electronic score is still one of the prolific composer's best, andLogan's Runremains an interesting example of '70s sci-fi that precededStar Warsby less than a year.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0045HCJKS", "B0016I0AJG", "B000P0J0BU", "B006MFQ4OS", "B0050MB5N4", "B00008438U", "B004LB5FDG", "B000063UR1", "B001DE29SI", "B0045HCJSA", "B001BGS17Q", "B0045HCJ9O", "0899668968", "B000087F6L", "B000E6ESEO", "B00000IREA", "B0003JAOO0", "0784011338", "B00AEBB8VK", "B004L9GMBC", "B000HEWEDK", "B002945DU2", "B002VA5A02", "B000O78KWE", "B00A44GNTE", "B00005JKFR", "B005FQ2H8W", "B0029ATTAQ", "B004KPLVV8", "B00009NHC0", "0780622650", "B004VT9JMG", "B00007JMD8", "B0045HCJ8A", "0783226063", "B0001I55SS", "B000BZN1NM", "B001BSBBNK", "B007Y1NNAW", "B000BOH8Y6", "B00005JKU0", "B00AEBB94G", "B000096IAC", "B005AMJ36U", "B00AJXO3S8", "B000QXDCJ2", "B003NH3X5Q", "B00BMJ7ZKG", "B008R65XN8", "B00005Y6XR", "B00005JP4N", "B00BJC8OJ2", "B001ECDVKE", "B0018O4YT0", "0767805712", "B000YBKO6U", "B00004XPPE", "B0016B6ZJW", "B000OA8OK4", "6305761078", "B00AEFYCW8", "6305869103", "B000E8QVBU", "0553025171", "B0002MHDW4", "B002I9Z8I0", "B001DW2BG0", "B00D9EJFZA", "0783225903", "B002GHHHKQ", "B00158K0QU", "B00CFHEFSO", "B00LC4PCVU", "B00F3L8P26", "B007JE3JQW", "B000QQJ3Q0", "B0006J28MS", "B00AQSN620", "B00441GYQ0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00EF1PM44", "B0045HCJKS", "B0016I0AJG", "B000E6ESEO"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 255518}, "asin": "0792839692", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/511T4XVBY9L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Logan's Run"}

{"description": "Director David Lean's masterful 1957 realization of PierreBoulle's novel remains a benchmark for war films, and a deeply absorbing movie by any standard--like most of Lean's canon,The Bridge on the River Kwaiachieves a richness in theme, narrative, and characterization that transcends genre.The story centers on a Japanese prison camp isolated deep in the jungles of Southeast Asia, where the remorseless Colonel Saito (Sessue Hayakawa) has been charged with building a vitally important railway bridge. His clash of wills with a British prisoner, the charismatic Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guinness), escalates into a duel of honor, Nicholson defying his captor's demands to win concessions for his troops. How the two officers reach a compromise, and Nicholson becomes obsessed with building that bridge, provides the story's thematic spine; the parallel movement of a team of commandos dispatched to stop the project, led by a British major (Jack Hawkins) and guided by an American escapee (William Holden), supplies the story's suspense and forward momentum.Shot on location in Sri Lanka,Kwaimoves with a careful, even deliberate pace that survivors of latter-day, high-concept blockbusters might find lulling--Lean doesn't pander to attention deficit disorders with an explosion every 15 minutes. Instead, he guides us toward the intersection of the two plots, accruing remarkable character details through extraordinary performances. Hayakawa's cruel camp commander is gradually revealed as a victim of his own sense of honor, Holden's callow opportunist proves heroic without softening his nihilistic edge, and Guinness (who won a Best Actor Oscar, one of the production's seven wins) disappears as only he can into Nicholson's brittle, duty-driven, delusional psychosis.

{"description": "Regardless of whether it was \"too early\" in 2006 to dramatize the events of September 11th, 2001, \"World Trade Center\" succeeds as a tribute to the courage and sacrifice of those who served at \"ground zero\" in the wake of terrorist attacks on the WTC's twin towers in New York City. Removed from the politics of war and terrorism (yet still, like all films, inherently political in expressing its point of view), Oliver Stone's potent drama focuses on the nightmarish ordeal, and subsequent rescue, of Port Authority policemen John McLoughlin (Nicolas Cage) and Will Jimeno (Michael Pe?a), who were buried deeply within the rubble of the WTC after the twin towers collapsed. Granted, it's only the film's historical context that distinguishes it from any other dramatic rescue story, but in focusing on the goodness of humanity in response to the evil of terrorists who remain unnamed and off-screen, Stone and first-time screenwriter Andrea Berloff create an emotional context as powerful as anything Stone has directed since \"Platoon\". Even as he resorts to some questionable tactics typically lacking in subtlety, Stone refrains from much of the blunt-force filmmaking that has made him a critical punching bag, rising to this challenging occasion with a heartfelt and deeply American portrait of unity ' personal, familial, and national. Flaws and all, \"World Trade Center\" serves an honorable purpose, reminding us all that for those fleeting days in September 2001, America showed its best face to a sympathetic world. --\"Jeff Shannon\"", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000GH3CR0", "B000EYJHDS", "B0006L0L5C", "0783223609", "B001F5274G", "B004X7UAMO", "B004WCSMDE", "B0000B1OBZ", "B008L0YN4U", "B005KBJC0I", "B00006B1HI", "B001MVWFAO", "B00AEBB8JM", "B00827OX5Q", "B00K2CHX9C", "B00K2CHW48", "B00006BS70", "B00003CXTG", "B00005JN5E", "B000065U1N", "B005VU9KW8", "B00006409F", "B000065Q9C", "B00AEBBA36", "B00AEFYENK", "B000KF0GWW", "B00063MCHA", "B004XFZ4JK", "B0013BM63O", "B00000G3PA", "B001MVYUR0", "B005DR64OQ", "B00005JK8K", "B00102F5WK", "B00005JM0O", "B0002V7ON8", "B004EPYZOO", "B007IUEEA2", "B000ELL1R6", "B000BBOUW2", "B000TGJ8CQ", "B000OVLBF8", "B000HRMAPE", "B003BV8ICM", "B000MGB6NM", "B001J710Z2", "B00005JMXX", "B001GCUO02", "B0015D20FE", "B003QO8TOQ", "B00005PJ8T", "B0077ATSSQ", "B001N44BVQ", "B008JFUNKU", "B00BUH1QHS", "B005F2JRUC", "B0002ZSKMS", "B004FQX59I", "B000GRUMRS", "B000FWHW7C", "B00AZNEW5G", "079284646X", "B00BTYMPX6", "B000059TG6", "B00012QLB4", "B00004Z4WR", "B000FUF6QI", "B007XF0W9O", "B00260HH2G", "B00008G8M4", "B000M4RG42", "B003ASLJQS", "B001SGEUYW", "B00GSBQ2HU", "B000JYW5DW", "0783225733", "B004A2AN5G", "B000BYA5G4", "B000A3XY5A", "B00001ZWUS", "B000EGDB10", "B0007KIFGE", "B000ZS8GWQ", "B00005JLRE", "6304711891", "6304806434", "B002NZK5VO", "B000P0J0C4", "B002O3Z50G", "B005LAIGYQ", "B002NXSRVG", "B00DZP1C2W", "B00005JNEI", "B00HEPE6MM", "B001HQZJMU", "B00HW3LAF2", "0800177967", "B000P0J09C", "B00AEFXGIY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000GH3CR0", "B0006L0L5C", "B000EYJHDS", "B001F5274G"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 748872}, "asin": "1415726698", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51F3dNW-7-L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "World Trade Center"}

{"description": "This cute movie by William Dear stars John Lithgow as a family man who befriends a Sasquatch (a.k.a. Bigfoot) and brings the friendly monster's oversized, hairy self into his Seattle home.

{"description": "A lot has changed since the original '70s-era gang of Scooby-Doo fans  gave way to today's followers of the hipster mystery cartoon series. For one,  nowadays kids don't have to wait around for the half-hour Saturday morning show- -they can pick up a copy ofScooby-Doo and the Alien Invaders. All the  familiar elements are here; even the groovy green Mystery Machine makes a  comeback, but it isn't as reliable as it used to be. At the outset ofAlien  Invaders, it breaks down, leaving the crime-solving crew stranded in a  creepy desert town overrun by aliens. From there, the plot unwinds faster than  Scooby can down a box of his namesake snacks. A band of swollen-headed purple  and green space guys--Zoinks--send the terrified teens scrambling for cover, but  it's not long before the quick-witted gang figures out that there's a team of  bad guys behind the bug-eyed masks. That's not to say, though, that real-life  aliens aren't also roaming the streets, as Shag and Scoob (who hook up in an  unprecedentedScooby-Dooromance with a peace sign-wearing babe and her  equally hip dog) discover in the course of clearing out of the phony aliens'  hair-raising path. To longtime viewers, the love angle seems unsettling; it  steals from the tightness of the mystery team. Still, with so much creepy fun to  get caught up in, it's a minor complaint. Scott Innes, the modern-day voice of  both Shaggy and Scooby, nails both parts, and Jennifer Love Hewitt fans also  will want to tune in--she sings theScoobytheme song.--Tammy La  Gorce", "related": {"also_bought": ["1560395737", "B00005MEP8", "B00005JD5F", "B00000JQTX", "B000063K5T", "B00022XE4U", "156039613X", "B00004TJEU", "B00008CQNB", "B000053VEG", "B0055HK7D8", "B0006D3HG0", "6304140754", "1560395907", "B00009KTYL", "B00000FYV9", "6304100507", "B00005BCMY", "6303534422", "B00005UF9I", "1573305677", "B00005UF9D", "B00006HBUC", "1560395532", "6304140762", "B00000G3AV", "079075181X", "B00007G24N", "6301404440", "6303052703", "1560395966", "6304434340", "B00005NVI0", "156039580X", "6304162286", "B00005V1Z8", "B00005V1Z7", "1560395796", "B000028U3S", "B00003CXQX", "0790736896", "0790732580", "0783222726", "B00003CXXI", "0783242425", "B00000JPG0"], "bought_together": ["1560395737", "B00000JQTX"], "also_viewed": ["B00000JQTX", "1560395737", "B00005MEP8", "B00005UF9D", "B00005JD5F", "B00004TJEU", "156039613X", "B0002B55YI", "B00007G24N", "B00008CQNB", "0790748266", "1560395966", "1560395532", "6304093365", "B00006FDMY", "6304140762", "B00006HBUC", "1560395907", "B0006H31TY", "B000005PIQ", "B00003CXXI", "0790742322", "B0000687L1", "B000063K5T", "B00000FYV9", "6304258623"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 176898}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.74, "brand": "Turner Home Ent", "asin": "1560396113", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514QRHRKKGL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Scooby Doo and the Alien Invaders [VHS]"}
{"description": "Arguably the worst movie that our lovable pals Joel, Crow, and Tom Servo have ever had the pain of  watching,Manos: Hands of Fateis destined to be anMST3Kclassic for this very reason. Not only is  there a sparse, illogical plot, but the cinematography is nonsensical (note Servo's point about the endless countryside  ride in Texas). That said,Manosmust be watched, and cringed at, and commented on by its viewers because of  the director's amazingly awful vision of what a horror film should be. What plot there is involves a vacationing family  being trapped in a remote ranch house in the desert that's \"managed\" by a greasy, what looks to be stoned, oversize  bow-legged keeper named \"Torgo.\" As the movie goes on, and one finds the \"master\" and his harem of semi-dead  women clad in see-through white dresses, one wonders more and more what the hell this movie was supposed to be  about. Even Dr.&nbsp;Forrester and Frank feel a little sorry for Joel and the boys' being forced to watch this one. Still,  you'll find yourself spiraling into hysterics when the women get into a big catty brawl while Joel and the boys liken  their antics to a Ladies Guild performingA Midsummer Night's Dreamor female dirt-wrestling.

{"description": "Fran&ccedil;ois Truffaut's third feature, though it's named for the two  best friends who become virtually inseparable in pre-World War&nbsp;I Paris, is  centered on Jeanne Moreau's Catherine, the most mysterious, enigmatic woman in his career-long gallery of rich female portraits. Adapted from the novel by Henri-Pierre Roch&eacute;, Truffaut's picture explores the 30-year friendship between Austrian biologist Jules (Oskar Werner) and Parisian writer Jim (Henri Serre) and the love triangle formed when the alluring Catherine makes the duo a trio. Spontaneous and lively, a woman of intense but dynamic emotions, she becomes the axle on which their friendship turns as Jules woos her and they marry, only to find that no one man can hold her. Directed in bursts of concentrated scenes interspersed with montage sequences and pulled together by the commentary of an omniscient narrator, Truffaut layers his tragic drama with a wealth of detail. He draws on his bag of New Wave tricks for the carefree days of youth--zooms, flash cuts, freeze frames--that disappear as the marriage disintegrates during the gloom of the postwar years. Werner is excellent as Jules, a vibrant young man whose slow, melancholy slide into emotional compromise is charted in his increasingly sad eyes and resigned face, while Serre plays Jim as more of an enigma, guarded and introspective. But both are eclipsed in the glare of Moreau's radiant Catherine: impulsive, demanding, sensual, passionate, destructive, and ultimately unknowable. A masterpiece of the French New Wave and one of Truffaut's most confident and accomplished films.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["1572524448"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 485144}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.97, "brand": "", "asin": "1572525851", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51NEMNZZ25L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Jules and Jim [VHS]"}

A sort of urban Western with a comic-book pace, artificial colors, fable-like tone, and broad acting, the film isn't intended to steep us in gritty realities so much as spin a decadent fantasy out of them.

The set design and cinematography combine to give both the flavor of documentary photos and the visual quality of movies from the period, and every performance meshes with the overall tone of sincerity, earnest optimism, and creeping desperation.

{"description": "Director Peter Bogdanovich (The Last Picture Show) tipped his hat to the classic screwball comedies of the 1930s, and especially the most glorious of them all, Howard Hawks'Bringing Up Baby. Barbra Streisand plays a charming flake who distracts a self-absorbed musicologist (Ryan O'Neal).

{"description": "Anyone who fought in Vietnam can tell you that the war bore little resemblance to this propagandistic action film starring and codirected by John Wayne. But the film itself is not nearly as bad as its reputation would suggest; critics roasted its gung-ho politics while ignoring its merits as an exciting (if rather conventional and idealistic) war movie. Some notorious mistakes were made--in the final shot, the sun sets in the east!--and it's an awkward attempt to graft WWII heroics onto the Vietnam experience. But as the Duke's attempt to acknowledge the men who were fighting and dying overseas, it's a rousing film in which Wayne commands a regiment on a mission to kidnap a Viet Cong general. David Janssen plays a journalist who learns to understand Wayne's commitment to battling Communism, and Jim Hutton (Timothy's dad) plays an ill-fated soldier who adopts a Vietnamese orphan.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300181715", "0792106989", "6303057225", "B000051S3Z", "6300988473", "6301736362", "6300183041", "6300268748", "B000GX4476", "6300208281", "6300267938", "B0009ML2JC", "6300215733", "6303192254", "0792102320", "6303686907", "6301797922", "0792110188", "630018627X", "6301802330", "6302158176", "630150528X", "6301976924", "6304457316", "6301325508", "6304935811"], "bought_together": ["6300181715"], "also_viewed": ["B000051S3Z", "6301736362"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 184276}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.44, "brand": "", "asin": "6300267830", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Z9GFPBN7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Green Berets [VHS]"}

Still, there is a lot to like about this movie, which finds Superman grappling with the conflict between his responsibilities as Earth's savior and his own needs of the heart.

Art Carney stars as a nearly retired detective who suddenly finds himself caught up in two seemingly separate cases. One involves the murder of his former partner (Howard Duff); the other entangles him with a flaky post-hippie (Lily Tomlin), who wants him to find her missing cat. The two cases eventually dovetail, but the plot--which leads them to a Hollywood crime bigwig played by the affable Eugene Roche--is of less interest than the almost magical chemistry between the crotchety Carney and the wonderfully off-the-wall Tomlin.

{"description": "The off-Broadway comedy-horror-musical hit that ran for years makes a successful transfer to film with a bevy of big-name cameos and two perfectly cast leads. Rick Moranis is the nebbish Seymour, who pines for flower-girl Audrey (Ellen Greene) while living in the basement of florist Mr. Mushnik (Vincent Gardenia). Things start turning around for Seymour, though, after he buys a little plant during a solar eclipse, christens it Audrey II, and discovers that it likes to drink blood. Soon enough, though, Seymour finds out that Audrey II, now grown to epic proportions, is in actuality a \"mean green mother from outer space\" that is hell-bent on world domination. Based on the 1960 Roger Corman cheapie that featured a young Jack Nicholson,Little Shopboasts a hilarious, amazing score by Howard Ashman and Alan Menken, who would go on to revitalize Disney's animation arm withThe Little MermaidandBeauty and the Beast. Greene, the lone holdover from the original cast, is a ravishing, goofy Audrey, whose awkward demeanor belies a voice that could knock Ethel Merman off her feet. She's ably matched by Moranis, whose lack of a singing voice is perfectly in sync with Seymour's nerdiness. And Levi Stubbs Jr. of the Four Tops provides the lowdown, nasty-minded voice of Audrey II; his rendition of the Oscar-nominated \"Mean Green Mother from Outer Space\" is a showstopper. As for those celebrity cameos, Steve Martin's sadistic dentist is a masterful creation, as is Bill Murray's masochistic patient; John Candy, James Belushi, and Christopher Guest also pop up. And there was never a lovelier and funkier Greek chorus than the three Motown-fueled girls (Tichina Arnold, Michelle Weeks, and Tisha Campbell) who appear throughout the film.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301871952", "B00000JGEI", "6303212379"], "also_viewed": ["B006ZUMNPY", "6302890926", "B00005BGO9"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 66547}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6300271285", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51NA5EZ89NL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Little Shop of Horrors [VHS]"}

{"description": "The long shadow of Malle's autobiographical memoir of occupied France continues to fall heavily across subsequent representations of World War II, boarding school, and male adolescence--in fact, it would be difficult to identify a recent film that addresses these concerns and does not, in some substantial way, echoAu Revoir Les Enfants. The straightforward, unsentimental, gutsyEnfantsfinds its 12-year-old protagonist, Julien Quentin, sheltered from the conflict in a Catholic school. His classmate Jean, a new arrival, becomes first a competitor, then a beloved friend. Jean, however, hides a secret from his classmates and the Gestapo; evenly, subtly, Malle creates an atmosphere of hovering and inescapable danger. It won't take you more than a few frames to guess Jean's \"secret,\" and many of the plot points here are too telescoped. Nevertheless, the plainspoken courage with which Malle tells his story remains wholly engrossing. The cinematography here is masterful and drunk with childlike wonder, alternating claustrophobic, wood-paneled church interiors with vivid, occasionally frightening outdoor vistas. And never is it more affecting than in the chilling scene where Justin gets lost in the woods during a seemingly innocent game of capture-the-treasure; trees and rocks flash by the running boy with an austere, impersonal beauty. Winner of seven Cesars (the French Oscars) in 1987, including Best Picture.

{"description": "This adaptation of the F. Scott Fitzgerald novel, scripted by Francis Ford Coppola, puts costume design and art direction above the intricacies of character. It's certainly a handsome try, and perhaps no movie could captureThe Great Gatsbyin its entirety. Robert Redford is an interesting casting choice as Gatsby, the millionaire isolated in his mansion, still dreaming of the woman he lost. And Sam Waterston is perfect as the narrator, Nick, who brings the dream girl Daisy Buchanan back to Gatsby. No, the problem seems to be that director Jack Clayton fell in love with the flapper dresses and the party scenes and the Jazz Age tunes, ending up with a Classics Illustrated version of a great book rather than a fresh, organic take on the text. While Redford grows more quietly intriguing in the film, Mia Farrow's pallid performance as Daisy leaves you wondering why Gatsby, or anyone else, should care so much about his grand passion. The effective supporting cast includes Bruce Dern as Daisy's husband, and Scott Wilson and Karen Black as the low-rent couple whose destinies cross the sun-drenched protagonists. (That's future star Patsy Kensit as Daisy's little daughter.)

Sam Jaffe takes up the rear guard in turban, loin, and full-body make-up as the titular Gunga Din, the loyal water carrier who dreams of becoming a soldier.

A sweet movie and perennial Christmas favorite, this is one of those movies that gets under your skin and must be revisited every so often.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303215734", "6300215695", "B000CQD1ZS", "6302227127", "6300207919", "6304117752", "B00000JKNP", "B000HEWEJO", "6302150620", "6305123616", "B00000JKNO", "B0000022WA", "6301964012", "6305282927", "6300215814", "B00008G8LY", "B00000JKNL", "B00000J1EQ", "B0000040EO", "B002GSXKQU", "B000021Y6M", "6302299497", "B001CW8016", "6303824358", "0790734079", "0780614097", "6300246965", "6304546270", "6300182304", "6304432119", "0790748169", "0783235593", "6301647734", "B00005RERY", "6303675212", "0790743213", "6301967275", "6300181111", "6305368139", "6301599896", "B00006HB09", "630220366X", "0792116887", "0767809262", "B0000DCGT1", "6301586042", "6302254132", "6300184919", "6301802608", "0800116917", "B00005ASSD", "6300216233", "6300214567", "6303313345", "6303101267", "B0000040CM", "6302409829"], "bought_together": ["6303215734", "6300215695"], "also_viewed": ["6303215734", "6304117752", "6300207919", "6304178352", "6304539274", "630233683X", "6304539258", "B001E4TDR2", "6305282927", "0792837630", "6304112254", "6304429274", "0792839129", "0788806270", "6300215695", "B0000040EO", "B00BAXTYIA", "6302787068", "B00329TVQA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 288247}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.24, "brand": "", "asin": "6301442962", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DHP05FPHL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Miracle on 34th Street  [VHS]"}

{"description": "The Ox-Bow Incidentis one of the essential Westerns, directed by William Wellman. A study of the effects--and aftereffects--of mob violence, this film (based on a true story) begins with the murder of a popular rancher. Angry townspeople form a posse, find suspects, and, without waiting for a trial, summarily hang them in an expression of biblically tinged frontier justice. But the one cowboy who tried to turn the mob aside ultimately proves that they executed innocent men. Made in 1943, the film features stunning black-and-white cinematography and a solid dramatic sense about what a deadly combination ignorance and self-righteousness can be.

{"description": "Kevin Costner as a warped serial killer, a pillar of the community whose dark side is embodied by an on-screen William Hurt? You have to admit, it sounds intriguing, right?Mr. Brooksis the vehicle for this unsavory story, and it turns out to be a lot less kicky than it sounds. Mr. Brooks is a Portland, Oregon tycoon and philanthropist whose \"addiction\" to murder is suddenly re-surfacing--with plenty of help from his sneering alter ego, who generally sits in the back of the car, goading Mr. Brooks on. (The other characters can't see William Hurt in all this, of course.) The unbelievably convoluted plot has Mr. Brooks confronted by a blackmailer (comedian Dane Cook) who has a surprising twist on things, and trailed by a cop (Demi Moore) who comes equipped with her own set of professional and marital woes. As if that weren't enough, when Brooks's daughter (Danielle Panabaker) comes home, it becomes clear that some traits run in the family.The scenes with Costner and Hurt are the best stuff in the film, even if director Bruce Evans can't figure out how to play fair visualizing their presence to others. But the script, which among other whoppers make Demi Moore's character a millionaire, is just too unbelievable to stomach.

{"description": "Louisa May Alcott's beloved story is one of the most-read novels ever written. It has also proved popular film and telefilm fodder (at least six versions plus a TV series). In addition,Little Womenis one of those rare literary projects that can truly be done well on screen. This, the 1933 version, chronicles the lives and loves of sisters Jo, Meg, Amy, and Beth (played, respectively, by Katharine Hepburn, Frances Dee, Joan Bennett, and Jean Parker). It's a superior rendering to the amiable, perky 1949 version with June Allyson, Janet Leigh, Elizabeth Taylor, Margaret O'Brien, and Peter Lawford, and comparable to the beautiful, feminist Gillian Armstrong 1994 take. Douglass Montgomery's Laurie isn't nearly as dreamy as Christian Bale's (1994), but the lack of chemistry between him and Hepburn's Jo is perfect for the story, in which Jo loves him like a brother. Jo's real love she offers up to perhaps the finest Professor Bhaer (Paul Lukas). Character actress Edna May Oliver is at her indignant best as Aunt March. Director George Cukor's vision is elegant, warm, and as true to the original source material as 117 minutes allows.

There's a loose fairy tale plot to keep dance neophytes interested, and Boris Aronson's eye-candy production design is a series of lavish dioramas. From an imperial-era Russian Christmas party out of Tolstoy, a young girl named Clara (Gelsey Kirkland) is whisked in dreams to an imaginary world populated by the animated creations of the wizard toy maker Drosselmeier (Alexander Minz), who prances on his stick-thin limbs like a Dickens illustration come to life. The main attraction is, of course, Mikhail Baryshnikov, one of the greatest classical dancers of the century, at his absolute peak of athleticism and precision. An opening slow-motion montage diagrams his fabled smoothness of execution, elegant airborne trajectories that have a feather-light perfection.  Music lovers who know only \"The Nutcracker Suite\" will relish the chance to hear this great score all the way through, conducted with lilt and vigor by Kenneth Schermerhorn.--David Chute", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001CW802A", "B00008AOR4", "6300215695", "0385249187", "B00003M5GE", "6304117752", "6300175197", "6301118251", "6304218036"], "bought_together": ["B001CW802A"], "also_viewed": ["B001CW802A", "B005USB2AE", "B001CZVVXM", "B001HBX918", "B00008AOR4", "B00003M5G8", "B00008AORF", "B000AYEI9A"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 179878}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.41, "brand": "", "asin": "6301971531", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4122320FN7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Nutcracker (The American Ballet Theatre) [VHS]"}

{"description": "Writer-director Sam Raimi's extremely stylized, blood-soaked follow-up to his creepyEvil Deadisn't really a sequel; rather, it's a remake on a better budget. It also isn't really a horror film (though there are plenty of decapitations, zombies, supernatural demons, and gore) as much as it is a hilarious, sophisticated slapstick send-up of the terror genre. Raimi takes every horror convention that exists and exaggerates it with mind-blowing special effects, crossed with mocking Three Stooges humor. The plot alone is a genre clich&eacute; right out of any number of horror films. Several teens (including our hero, Ash, played by Bruce Campbell in a manic tour-de-force of physical comedy) visit a broken-down cottage in the woods--miles from civilization--find a copy of the Book of the Dead, and unleash supernatural powers that gut every character in sight. All, that is, except Ash, who takes this very personally and spends much of the of the film getting his head smashed while battling the unseen forces. Raimi uses this bare-bones story as a stage to showcase dazzling special effects and eye-popping visuals, including some of the most spectacular point-of-view Steadicam work ever (done by Peter Deming). Although it went unnoticed in the theaters, the film has since become an influential cult-video favorite, paving the way for over-the-top comic gross-out films like Peter Jackson'sDead Alive.--Dave McCoy", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305095566", "6302798450", "B00023NRSM", "6303257879", "0790705141", "6304983794", "6302921058", "6300214087", "B000WC3864", "6300182878", "0783227434", "6300262731", "6302088607", "6300181987", "B000005XXG", "B0001VL30O", "B000007PI9", "6303396585", "6304288433", "6300213714", "6303579388", "6300189015", "0792836685", "6300214192", "6301094352", "0783235607", "0783246641", "6304451024", "0790741512", "0792845684", "630428845X", "6300214311", "0767825411", "0792836634", "6300262855", "6302814359", "B00000I4R9"], "bought_together": ["6305095566", "6302798450"], "also_viewed": ["B00IF8Q0YE", "6305095566", "6302798450", "6300182878", "B000RIWAVW", "6301208536", "0792839234", "6302921058"]}, "price": 5.0, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 222150}, "asin": "6302038308", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Z%2BYIlqC1L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Evil Dead II [VHS]"}

{"description": "One of Humphrey Bogart's finest performances dominates this unusual 1950 film noir, which focuses less on the murder mystery at the center of its plot than on the investigation's devastating effect on a fragile romance. For Bogart, already a noir icon, the Andrew Solt script afforded an opportunity to explore a more complex and contradictory role--an antiheroic persona in line with the actor's most accomplished and absorbing triumphs throughout his career.For maverick director Nicholas Ray, the film posed the challenge of taking crime dramas beyond their usual formulas and into a more mature realm, as well as a chance to cast a jaundiced eye on the film industry itself. Its protagonist is Dixon Steele, a Hollywood screenwriter with an acerbic wit and a violent temper. Tasked with adapting a bestseller, he meets a hatcheck girl who's read the book, hoping to glean its highlights before writing the script. When she's found murdered, Steele becomes the prime suspect, and a tightening knot of suspicion forms around the writer.Steele's only, inconclusive witness is a pretty new neighbor, Laurel (Gloria Grahame), and the couple fall in love even as the pressure mounts. At first the new relationship is a tonic to the hard-boiled writer, who plunges into his script with a renewed vigor and discipline. But as the police continue to shadow him, Steele's own penchant for violence erupts against friends, strangers, and even Laurel herself, whose feelings are increasingly eclipsed by suspicion that her lover is a murderer, and fear that he'll harm her.Bogart conveys Steele's world-weariness and underlying vulnerability, and manages the delicate task of making both his romantic yearning and sudden, murderous rages equally convincing. Ultimately, that performance and Grahame's sympathetic work elevateIn a Lonely Placeinto what has been called \"an existential love story\" more than a crime drama.--Sam Sutherland", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000068EE", "6304056869", "6302413435", "B000BWIZRW", "6301978110", "0790743159", "6303364772", "B0007ZEO8C", "6302375827", "6302226899", "6304039522", "6304212151", "1558807780", "B001BZQMFA", "6302120446", "6301968948", "6304212135", "079074886X", "0783217528", "0790746387", "6300208249", "6302952581", "6301491920", "6301564456", "6302797675", "0790743531", "6301966430", "0783217390", "6302700949", "B00000493Q", "6300183912", "6302305942", "6301005740", "6301640667", "6302753198", "0783236352", "630292300X", "6302305950", "6302281849", "630150528X", "6303120474", "6303128890", "630196697X", "0792837096", "6302800897", "6302797519", "6304119038"], "bought_together": ["B000BWIZRW"]}, "price": 14.9, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 298317}, "asin": "6302801133", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510CFAB9KDL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "In a Lonely Place [VHS]"}

{"description": "This adaptation of E.M. Forster's mysterious tale of British racism in colonial India turned out to be master director David Lean's final film. Subtle and grand at the same time, Lean's adaptation is faithful to the book, rendering its blend of the mystical and the all-too human with exquisite precision. Judy Davis plays a young British woman traveling in India with her fianc&eacute;'s mother. While visiting a tourist attraction, she has a frightening moment in a cave--one that she eventually spins from an instant of mental meltdown into a tale of a physical attack that ruins several lives. Lean captures Forster's sense of awe at the kind of ageless wisdom and inexplicable phenomena to be encountered in India, as well as the British tendency to dismiss it all as savage, rather than simply different.--Marshall Fine", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303084095", "6303052223", "B005S9EJ14"], "bought_together": ["6303084095"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 341765}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 10.98, "brand": "", "asin": "6302814138", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GMQRBZ2DL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Passage to India [VHS]"}

{"description": "Made two years afterCitizen Kane, this 1943 version of Charlotte Bront&#xEB;'sJane Eyresure looks like star Orson Welles muscled his way behind the camera much of the time. (In fact, costar Joan Fontaine--who plays the title character--has maintained that Welles methodically did just that every day on the set.) Not that the film's official director was a hack: Robert Stevenson, who later had a busy career at Disney making numerous live-action hits for the studio, such asMary Poppins, gets the credit. But there's no mistaking Welles's masterful hand in the film's bold and creative look, and there's no getting away from his enigmatic charisma as Rochester, the widower who takes in Jane as a governess to his daughter. An engrossing, gorgeous film, there's even a small role for Elizabeth Taylor at the beginning as Jane's unlucky, doomed friend at a cruel boarding school.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302278929", "6302148669", "B001D8W7EU", "6300248550", "6302363292", "6301670140", "6301967496", "6303364772", "630310245X", "6301973410", "630150528X", "6301797957", "B000056BRF", "B000021Y6K", "B000003KE0", "630160086X", "630196912X", "6302226899", "6302120527", "B000006GCU", "630266232X", "B000005XPV", "6302503493", "6302374227", "6301977815", "6303002064", "6300267970", "B007RKFY98", "0783236352", "B003MG6FJY", "6302593220", "6301661826", "6302098424", "6304509146", "6301805615", "0790733935", "6302004446", "6302413419", "6300183920", "B00000I1DI", "630196571X", "6301978536", "6300215741", "0792107683", "6301706587", "B00005A1VH", "6301628667", "6300268799", "6300269310", "6300208133", "0792845684"], "bought_together": ["6302278929"], "also_viewed": ["B000784WMW", "B00AATUZQA", "B0053Q9DHW", "B000LPQ6DE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 279347}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.89, "brand": "", "asin": "6302878535", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51KMCKYK08L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Jane Eyre [VHS]"}

{"description": "Despite its melodramatic title, which carried on a '50s doomsday naming convention, this taut 1961 English science fiction thriller offers an object lesson in the power of story over special effects. When both the Soviets and the West detonate nuclear tests simultaneously, the seismic double whammy jolts the earth off its axis and onto a new orbit sending it fatally closer to the sun--a fate that writer-director-producer Val Guest views from the street-level perspective of its principal characters, rather than an off-world vantage point. The street in question, however, is London's Fleet Street, the venerable hub of its newspaper and tabloid publishers, and the hard-nosed reporters growing realization that their number is up carries its own stark punch. Edward Judd is Peter Stenning, a rugged, appropriately grim reporter, Leo McKern is tough but compassionate editor Bill Maguire, and Janet Munro is Stenning's love interest, in an elfin, sexy turn that's a striking contrast to her best-known turn in Disney'sDarby O'Gill and the Little People. With an effects arsenal that consists largely of a spray bottle to apply beads of \"sweat,\" Guest and his small but crack cast are surprisingly effective, and the cold war plot hook still works, thanks to its uncomfortable proximity to more contemporary environmental terrors.--Sam Sutherland", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B00AEBB94G"]}, "price": 14.88, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 464071}, "asin": "6303026613", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51E1XPTBQWL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Day the Earth Caught Fire [VHS]"}

{"description": "Drifting as far from Michael Winner's original and interesting 1974Death Wishas possible, this belated sequel in an often ugly series is nevertheless a harmless, fairly conventional thriller featuring a watchable cast. After his life of loss and misery at the hands of criminals, vigilante Paul Kersey is ready to settle down in romantic bliss with a fashion designer named Olivia (Lesley-Anne Down). Unfortunately, the lady happens to be the target of her mobster ex-husband (Michael Parks), who has a tight grip on New York's garment district. Disfigured and finally murdered by her former spouse, Olivia is avenged in very creative ways by Paul, who resorts to such esoterica as using a remote-controlled soccer ball to deliver an explosive punishment. Bronson largely phones it in for this potboiler, though even in the winter of his life he can look quite compelling in his stoic way. Helping to keep things interesting is Parks's kinky cruelty and Saul Rubinek's vaguely bemused performance as a well-meaning prosecutor.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["630196666X", "0792110285", "6300987744", "6303920098", "6304773390", "6302089840", "6301971426", "B000050NS3"]}, "price": 6.35, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 319569}, "asin": "6303092306", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HJWG07YPL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Death Wish - The Face Of Death [VHS]"}
{"description": "For those who never thought Disney would release a film in which Santa Claus is kidnapped and tortured, well, here it is!  The full title isTim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas, which should give you an idea of the tone of this stop-action animated musical/fantasy/horror/comedy.  It is based on characters created by Burton, the former Disney animator best known as the director ofPee-wee's Big Adventure,Beetlejuice,Edward Scissorhands, and the first twoBatmanmovies. His benignly scary-funny sensibility dominates the story of Halloweentown resident Jack Skellington (voice by Danny Elfman, who also wrote the songs), who stumbles on a bizarre and fascinating alternative universe called ... Christmastown!  Directed by Henry Selick (who later made the delightfulJames and the Giant Peach), this PG-rated picture has a reassuringly light touch.  As Roger Ebert noted in his review, &quot;some of the Halloween creatures might be a tad scary for smaller children, but this is the kind of movie older kids will eat up; it has the kind of offbeat, subversive energy that tells them wonderful things are likely to happen.&quot;--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["0788812408", "6302526574", "6300274268", "B000C3L27U", "6300274195", "155890641X", "0788812807", "6304290888", "6304401132", "B00005JKDQ", "6304500831", "0788802194", "6303314015", "6302787068", "6304089767", "6304155972", "B00003CX7L", "6302642248", "B00000ICHA", "6305229449", "0788803743", "6304978286", "6302320402", "6305326940", "6305319138", "B0000AQZYM", "0788806270", "6302178924", "B00005K9OA", "6302968143", "B000035Z2S", "6303983812", "6304400551", "6304501153", "6302961572", "6302794331", "B00005JL95", "B00003CWPW", "B00004R99N", "1558906150", "B00003CXQX", "0788805843", "B003UAKE9Y", "6305940932", "B000035Z46", "B00005JKX3", "0788805533", "6304100507", "6303232221", "6303018343", "078881172X", "6304492960", "6303534422", "6304492979", "B00000JS61", "6304492952", "6304293968", "6302426200", "B0000524CZ", "6300274608", "6301991311", "6302642493", "B00000J2JA", "B00007AJLB", "B00005LL26", "6301948106", "6301390725", "6304873441", "B00006953H", "6304089627", "0788812181", "B00005RDVV", "6300275310", "0788810448", "B00005JLR1", "B00005T7H1", "B000063V14", "6300276554", "B000009CTR", "6304089201", "0790742322", "0788811002", "B00003CXHR", "6303442447", "6304400225", "B0002YLCHE", "6305310068", "B008OGW5XC", "B000063V8N", "1423178696", "B00000JYLP", "B00003CXJ3", "B00029LO18", "B002VDBRIS", "6303929338", "6303315305", "6304416415", "078880782X", "B000IFRQHC"], "bought_together": ["B000C3L27U"], "also_viewed": ["6303314015", "0788812408", "6304089767", "6302526574", "6304290888", "6305229449", "6302158095", "0788805843", "078881172X", "6302178924", "B00003CXQX", "6304155972", "6302968143", "0788802194", "B000035Z2S", "6303983812", "155890641X", "6304978286", "6302794331", "6300274268", "6303036813", "6300275310", "B00005JL95", "B000C3L27U", "6303534422", "6302320402", "B003L4Y5BW", "6304500831", "0788805533", "6303939015", "6305940932", "6302787068", "B00005RDVV", "6302426200", "6301404440", "B00005JKDQ", "0788812807", "B00004R99N", "6303929338", "B000009CTR", "B00003CX7L", "6302484359", "6305326940", "0788812181", "B000035Z46", "6301991311", "6303168957", "6303925235", "6305319138", "0788806270", "6304416415", "6304400381", "6304089201", "B00000F8J1", "0788811002", "6304400225", "B0034GK74G", "B00016JF2W", "6300274195"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 144750}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.0, "brand": "", "asin": "6303122647", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510VC795MQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]"}

{"description": "As funny as Lucy (Lucille Ball), Ricky (Desi Arnaz), Ethel (Vivian Vance), and Fred (William Frawley) were during their lengthy stay in Hollywood, their \"Adventures in Europe\" are equally hilarious and memorable. The episodes begin with Lucy and Ethel scamming their way into a trip taken because Ricky's band will perform abroad (Fred serves as the tour manager).  Nothing comes easy for the Ricardos and Mertzes, and both Lucy and Fred find themselves in a bind when their birth certificates can't be found. The planned excursion is also intimidating to Fred, who is prone to seasickness. Lucy provides a cure, and thenshegets sick--but only after missing the ship.Once in London, Lucy plots a scheme to meet the queen. Lucy then inadvertently gets the gang invited to the country home of an aristocrat whose daughter, Lucy fears, covets Ricky. Later, Lucy seeks her roots and dreams of Ricky as a Scottish ancestor. In Paris, Lucy may be conned, but she's simply divine battling her first escargot. She also meets French idol Charles Boyer (who plays himself) and dons what she thinks is a Parisian designer gown. And can the Mertzes and Ricardos be in the Swiss Alps without an avalanche? Don't bet on it. At a seedy joint in Florence, Lucy finds a creative way to celebrate son Little Ricky's birthday and also gets offered a movie role and stomps grapes. Somehow, the gang finds time to bicycle from Italy to the French Riviera, where Lucy accidentally wins a bunch of money. Eventually they return home, in a brilliant episode in which Lucy disguises a 30-pound hunk of cheese as a baby.--N.F.

{"description": "Richard Donner's 1978 epic about the Man of Steel showed how a film about a superhero could be a moving and romantic experience even for people who long ago gave up comic books. Beginning on the icy planet Krypton, the story follows the baby Kal-El, whose rocket ship lands in Smallville, Kansas. He is found there by a childless couple and raised as the shy Clark Kent (the young Kent is played by Jeff East). The film is perhaps most touching in these sequences, with expanses of wheat fields blowing in the wind and with a young man who can't figure out what part in destiny his great powers are meant to play. The second half, with Reeve taking over as Clark/Superman, is bustling, enchanting (the scene in which Superman flies girlfriend Lois Lane--played by Margot Kidder--through the night sky is great date material), and funny, thanks largely to Gene Hackman's sardonic portrayal of nemesis Lex Luthor.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300268993", "B000059XYC", "6300270122", "6303020089", "B000059XXZ", "0784011923", "B0002XNSYA", "B00005A1VG", "6303506291", "6301969413", "0800198395", "6302941318", "6304509154", "630196649X", "6304508611", "0790731975", "0790700506", "6300181537", "B000059XY5", "0790733897", "B00000JGEI", "6300214311", "6304047843", "6302238331", "6300214060", "630407185X", "6303148352", "6303212379", "6302510023", "0783216084", "B00004TYS8", "6302380294", "0790744589", "0792133153", "6302091632", "6302098424", "6304143184", "B0000068SI", "B00004RNAC", "6302510031", "630251018X", "6302510015", "B0000CDL3W", "6302510198", "B0001VL30O", "B000006FNX", "6302909023", "B000065U6Q", "6302032377"], "bought_together": ["6300268993", "B000059XYC"], "also_viewed": ["B000IJ79WU", "6300268993", "B000059Z8K", "B000P6XQ50", "B0039208JE", "6300270122", "B000IJ79VQ", "B000059XYC", "B000IJ79X4", "B001DJLD2G", "B000059XXZ", "B00F4FFO8E", "B00005JKCH", "6302642248", "6303953425", "B00005LIRF", "B00EAPMGIU", "B000IJ79XE", "B00BBND56G", "0790734079", "0784011923", "B000VI70QS", "B00005LKLF", "B000059Z8L", "B000UR9T8C", "B00005JXY3", "B0039208QM", "6303506291", "B0016MOWOQ", "B0087F7VSY", "B00000GUNY", "0783222726", "B00DYEN6XC", "B00E5I2MCM", "B0090SI582", "B00JPS6A3O", "B0057R5XRG", "B008JFUO72", "B008JFUS0U"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 202304}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.75, "brand": "", "asin": "6303212263", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51E39PXF9BL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Superman the Movie [VHS]"}

{"description": "Jonathan Demme's sexy 1986 road comedy, a story about the liberation of a stuffed-shirt businessman (Jeff Daniels) by a free-spirited punkette (Melanie Griffith), looks better and better as the years go by. By dressing Griffith in a bowl-cut black wig and giving her character the resonant nickname Lulu, Demme establishes a clear link with G.W. Pabst's 1928 Louise Brooks melodramaPandora's Box--except that in this case the influence of a sexual free spirit is not seen as malign or corrupting. The turning point comes when the girl's hard-edged manner is discarded along with the wig and the nickname: Lulu turns into Audrey, a touchingly vulnerable, fluffy blonde. Ray Liotta, making his first big splash as Audrey's ex-con ex-husband, a hot-wired collection of homicidal tics, personifies the menacing aspects of the \"wild side\" of life. The intensity of the final showdown between Daniels and Liotta startles some viewers, but it provides a needed catharsis.

{"description": "David Lean focused all his talent as an epic-maker on Boris Pasternak's sweeping novel about a doctor-poet in revolutionary Russia. The results may sometimes veer toward soap opera, especially with the screen frequently filled with adoring close-ups of Omar Sharif and Julie Christie, but Lean's gift for cramming the screen with spectacle is not to be denied. The streets of Moscow, the snowy steppes of Russia, the house in the country taken over by ice; these are re-created with Lean's unerring sense of grandness. The movie is so lush and so long that it becomes an irresistible wallow, even when logic suffers--likeGone with the Windbefore it andTitanicafter.

{"description": "There were only two ways for \"classicTrek\" cast members to appear in a movie with the cast ofStar Trek: The Next Generation: either Capt. Kirk and his contemporaries would have to be very, very old, or there would be some time travel involved in the plot. Since geriatric heroes aren't very exciting (despite a welcomed cameo appearance by the aged Dr. McCoy),Star Trek: Generationsunites Capt. Kirk (William Shatner) and Capt. Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) in a time-jumping race to stop a madman's quest for heavenly contentment. When a mysterious energy coil called the Nexus nearly destroys the newly christened U.S.S.Enterprise-B, the just-retired Capt. Kirk is lost and presumed dead. But he's actually been happily trapped in the timeless purgatory of the Nexus--an idyllic state of being described by the mystical Guinan (Whoopi Goldberg) as \"pure joy.\" Picard must convince Kirk to leave this artificial comfort zone and confront Dr. Soran (Malcolm McDowell), the madman who will threaten billions of lives to be reunited with the addictive pleasure of the Nexus. With subplots involving the android Data's unpredictable \"emotion chip\" and the spectacular crash-landing of the starshipEnterprise, this crossover movie not only satisfiedTrekfans, but it also gave them something they'd never had to confront before: the heroic and truly final death of a belovedStar Trekcharacter.

{"description": "Here's a classic Hollywood star vehicle.Up Close and Personal--the story of Tally Atwater (Michelle Pfeiffer), an inexperienced but ambitious TV news personality, and her well-weathered journalistic mentor, Warren Justice (Robert Redford)--was carefully tailored to fit its stars. What began as a screenplay based on the biography of troubled TV anchorwoman Jessica Savitch (Golden Girl, by Alanna Nash) took more than eight years to reach the screen, written and rewritten, on and off, over the years by husband-and-wife team John Gregory Dunne and Joan Didion, mainly because they needed the work to qualify for the splendid Writers' Guild health-insurance plan. Although the considerable charisma of Pfeiffer and Redford go a long way, in many respects Nash's original nonfiction book (and even Dunne's peculiarly disingenuous \"insider\" account of the writing of the screenplay,Monster: Living Off the Big Screen) offers tales more compelling than the one that eventually made it to the screen. But, all things considered, that's a little like comparing apples and oranges, since the slickUp Close and Personalbears about as much resemblance to its gritty original source material as...well, an apple does to an orange. Critic Roger Ebert, who awarded the movie three stars, nevertheless said he was reminded of the time producer Samuel Goldwyn commissioned a screenplay about the Lindbergh kidnapping.

{"description": "Initially broadcast as a TV miniseries to go with the series of threeAnthologydouble-CD albums, this set of eight documentary tapes has the  heft and scope of one ofKen  Burns's expansive projects. Still, unless you are either a historian or a  truly committed fan, you'll find yourself with way more material--particularly  about the Beatles' early lives as lads in Liverpool--than you'll want to watch.  The documentary material is copious, including early performance films and  tapes, at the point before they found their true voices. The actual Beatlemania  years--beginning in 1963 and concluding in 1970--feature extensive performance  films, as well as home movies and archival material. The best parts, of course,  are the interviews with the Beatles themselves, who produced the entire thing.  Along with reworking two previously unreleased John Lennon tracks as \"new  Beatles songs,\" theAnthologyincludes some unseen Lennon interview tapes  so that his acerbic voice can be heard as well. This stands as a comprehensive  document of that heady period, the second coming of rock & roll, as the Beatles  took what Elvis had started and expanded upon it exponentially. The tapes give a  solid sense of the historical context and the way these four musicians changed  the world around them in the 1960s.--Marshall Fine", "related": {"also_bought": ["630382336X", "6301966376", "6303823351", "B00000JRUB", "6302213142", "6301229479"], "bought_together": ["630382336X"], "also_viewed": ["B002BSHWUU", "B003YNFYCO", "0780615018", "B000002TYX", "B000002TYZ", "630382336X", "B0006V97B6", "B0030ATZIA", "6303029086", "6305073694", "B0000542D2", "B007I8KXQ8"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 315554}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 35.95, "brand": "Apple Corps Ltd.", "asin": "630416923X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5135NX6248L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Beatles Anthology Collector's Set [VHS]"}
{"description": "Vincent Price gives an atypically restrained performance as the sole survivor of a worldwide plague that revives its victims as bloodthirsty vampires. During the day, he canvasses his abandoned hometown, tracking down and stalking his former friends and neighbors, always making sure to return before nightfall, when the dead rise to assault his fortified house. Hope arrives in the form of an apparently normal young woman (Franca Bettoia), but her agenda proves to be even more sinister than that of the vampires.Based on the 1954 novel by coscripter Matheson (whose displeasure with the final product spurred the use of a pseudonym), this Italian-made production is best known for its influence on George Romero'sNight of the Living Dead. The similarities between the two films go beyond the presence of shuffling zombies and housebound heroes; both feature taboo-breaking scenes of interfamilial murder, and both end on bleak, dystopian notes. WhileThe Last Man on Earthlacks the political and darkly satirical shadings (and graphic gore) that makeNight of the Living Deada more memorable experience, the combination of Bava-esque Gothic atmosphere and bleak, documentary-style camerawork by directors Ragona and Salkow (the brother of Price's agent Lester Salkow) lend themselves to moments of pure frisson that compare laudably to Romero's film.  Matheson's novel also provided the source material for the awkward 1971 Charlton Heston vehicleThe Omega Man. A planned third version, helmed by Ridley Scott and starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, was shut down in its earliest stages due to skyrocketing budget costs.--Paul Gaita", "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 751347}, "asin": "6304277385", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/7114X6M9A7L._SY300_.gif", "title": "Last Man on Earth [VHS]"}
{"description": "A corrosively funny, semiautobiographical account by writer-director Bruce Robinson (How to Get Ahead in Advertising) about a couple of destitute roommates, young actors living in drunken squalor in 1969, the twilight days of swingin' London. Withnail (the astounding Richard E. Grant in a definitive performance) is a kind of depraved, modern-day Oscar Wilde, but without the money or the manners. The \"I\" of the title is the younger and more impressionable Marwood (Paul McGann), who stands somewhat in awe of his scandalous, demented, hysterical pal. While on a miserable holiday in the bitterly cold and damp countryside, they stay with wealthy, corpulent \"Uncle Monty\" (Richard Griffiths), who takes quite a liking to young Marwood, much to his consternation. Though not well known in the United States,Withnail & Ihas a major cult following in England. It's uproariously funny in a peculiarly British way, and the acting is absolutely scintillating. (Chicago Sun-Timescritic Roger Ebert said Griffiths's was the best performance by an actor in a British film since Denholm Elliott inA Room with a View.)

But make no mistake: director Matthew Bright isn't out to feed anyone's sickest impulse. This is a scathing satire in the age of Jerry Springer fistfights and &quot;real&quot; TV shows likeCops, in which the &quot;I-5 Killer&quot; (Kiefer Sutherland) meets a wayward teenager (Reese Witherspoon) on the freeway that provides his nickname. She confides in the man but soon discovers his gruesome intentions, and ... well, let's just say she effectively defends herself, only to find later that the killer (whose wife is played by Brooke Shields, no less!) has used the media to his advantage.

{"description": "Disney's 1959 animated effort was the studio's most ambitious to date, a widescreen spectacle boasting a gorgeous waltz-filled score adapting Tchaikovsky. In the 14th century, the malevolent Maleficent (not dissimilar to the wicked Queen in Disney'sSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs) taunts a king that his infant Aurora will fatally prick her finger on a spinning wheel before sundown on her 16th birthday. This, of course, would deny her a happily-ever-after with her true love. Things almost but not quite turn out that way, thanks to the assistance of some bubbly, bumbling fairies named Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather. It's not really all that much about the title character--how interesting can someone in the middle of a long nap be, anyway? Instead, those fairies carry the day, as well as, of course, good Prince Phillip, whose battle with the malevolent Maleficent in the guise of a dragon has been co-opted by any number of animated films since. See it in its original glory here. And Malificent's castle, filled with warthogs and demonic imps in a macabre dance celebrating their evil ways, manages a certain creepy grandeur.--David Kronke", "related": {"also_bought": ["155890641X", "0788802194", "0788812408", "6302526574", "0788806270", "0788812807", "078881172X", "6302642248", "6302787068", "6302320402", "6304500831", "6303314015", "6300274268", "B000035Z2S", "6300274195", "0788805843", "6305229449", "0788803743", "6302961572", "6302178924", "6304290888", "6303983812", "6300275310", "6305940932", "B0000AQZYM", "6304089767", "6305319138", "0788805533", "6304400551", "6304978286", "6304100507", "6302158095", "B00005JKDQ", "6305326940", "6304089201", "6303929338", "6304501153", "6303534422", "B00003CXQX", "6303036813", "B00005T7H6", "6301390725", "B00003CX7L", "6304873441", "B0000524CZ", "B00000ICHA", "B00004R99N", "6304400225", "B00004R99I", "B0009SUS4Q", "6302426200", "6300274608", "0788812440", "6303122647", "B0000E32WB", "0788811002", "0788810634", "B00000JS61", "B00005RDVV", "6303939015", "B00016JF2W", "B00005RDWC", "0790748266", "B000JBWWRO", "6304117752", "1558906150", "B00003CXHR", "B000035Z46", "6303486894", "0788812181", "6303392350", "B003H9M1Q2", "6303148387", "6302484359", "1558901892", "B00005JL95", "B00003CXQ6", "6301948106", "6305177473", "0788809806", "B00007AJLB", "B00003CWPW", "6305942285", "B000B8I8T6", "B00335EQ0E", "6301991311", "B0002YLCHE", "630460016X", "0788810448", "B00004REYY", "B003ZHVJGO", "B000063V8N", "078880720X", "B00004R99O", "B00005JKX3", "6300276554", "1558906630", "B000009CTR", "B00005RRG3"], "bought_together": ["155890641X", "0788802194"], "also_viewed": ["155890641X", "0788802194", "6302526574", "0788806270", "078881172X", "0788812408", "6300274268", "6302787068", "6304500831", "0788812807", "6302320402", "6303314015", "0788805843", "6302642248", "6302178924", "6302961572", "6305319138", "6303983812", "6300274195", "6305229449", "B000035Z2S", "6304089767", "B0000AQZYM", "6304978286", "0788805533", "6303929338", "6304290888", "6305940932", "6304400551", "6303534422", "6300275310", "6304100507", "6304089201", "6302158095", "B00005JKDQ", "B001DXF9FE", "B00003CXCQ", "B0007KTBIU", "6305326940", "B00004R99N", "6304501153", "6304400225", "6302426200", "6303036813", "B00003CXQX", "6300274608", "B0000E32WB", "B00003CXHR", "B00000ICHA", "0788811002", "B00005JL95", "B003ZHVJGO", "B00005RDVV", "B0000022WA", "0788812440", "1558906150", "B00003CX7L", "B0000524CZ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 50797}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.49, "brand": "Walt Disney Home Video", "asin": "6304401132", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Y7WQST4JL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Sleeping Beauty (Fully Restored Limited Edition) (Walt Disney's Masterpiece)  [VHS]"}

{"description": "Audrey Hepburn's last Oscar nomination was for this adaptation of Frederick Knott's famed stage thriller about a blind woman, a con man (Alan Arkin), and a doll full of heroin. Thanks to Hepburn's husband, a photographer who does a good deal of traveling, she's unknowingly come into possession of said doll, which was given to him on a plane by a comely young drug runner who winds up dead. The murderous Arkin, aided by sympathetic henchman Richard Crenna, will let nothing stand in the way of his obtaining it, even if it comes down to assaying multiple \"personalities\" in order to visit and terrorize Hepburn; Crenna is unwillingly enlisted to help. However, the \"world's champion blind lady\" (as Hepburn sardonically states) is more than up to the task of defending herself in her basement Manhattan apartment in a heart-stopping climax that to this day still defines the way horror movies with jack-in-the-box psychos are made. Despite the obvious staginess of it all (the entire action takes place in Hepburn's apartment), it still works magnificently, thanks to Hepburn's steely will and Arkin's deadly, sadistic madman. A helpful hint: turn out all the lights when you watch it; theaters back in 1967 did so, killing the guiding lights during the film's last 15 minutes.

Yes, Virginia, a large transvestite actually eats dog feces as a kind of dizzying denouement to this frequently illogical and intentionally disgusting movie, but by the time that happens, you're already numb ... and you've possibly laughed to the point of losing bladder control.The plot revolves around two vile families laying claim to the title \"The Filthiest People Alive.\" You've got pregnant women in pits, you've got grown men getting sexual satisfaction from chickens, you've got people licking furniture to perform trailer-park voodoo, and you've got classic lines like: \"Oh my God! The couch ... it ... it rejected you!\"Waters, who went on to direct genuine pop-culture classics such asHairsprayandSerial Mom, made this celluloid sideshow with one aim--to make a name for himself. It worked. He does have a genuine eye for filmmaking (when the trailer burns down, you feel the white heat of Divine's pain and anger).

{"description": "What would the average sensible American do if he encountered a pulsing ball of protoplasm from outer space? That's right: he'd poke it with a stick. Thus begins the endearingly earnest and silly tale of The Blob. Young Steve McQueen takes on his first leading role as, um, Steve, a spunky teenager with plenty of heart. Steve sees the blob kill the local doc, but darn it, none of the town's adults will believe him! Yup, it's up to the teens to save the day! Steve and his trusty girlfriend Jane break their curfews(!) and head off into the night to find the Blob and warn the town. The Blob is a completely enjoyable watch from start to finish, offering the triple pleasures of 1950s morals, gee-whiz acting, and a whole lotta extras running around and screaming. The special effects, though primitive, certainly get the job done, and it is still a treat to watch the Blob ooze its way to its next meal. You may notice that the theme song is surprisingly bouncy for a horror flick (\"Beware of the Blob! It creeps, and leaps, and glides and slides across the floor\").

{"description": "Phil Tucker'sRobot Monsterhas rightfully earned a place in the  pantheon of bad movies over the years, and for good reason--it makes anything  done by Ed Wood look like an Orson Welles masterpiece. Picture, if you will, a  gorilla in a diving helmet (the Ro-Man) who wipes out all of the Earth's  population except for one family (the Hu-Mans), whom he terrorizes through the  rest of the film. From his headquarters in a Bronson Canyon cave, he  communicates with his superiors via World War&nbsp;II surplus radio gear and a  Lawrence Welk-style bubble machine, then shambles around the woods looking for  his quarry. The plot of this post-holocaust sci-fi nonsense is hardly worth  going into past that point, except to say that it's stupendously, staggeringly  awful filmmaking. It's even more incredible when you consider that the writers  and director undoubtedly believed that they were making a deep, serious, grave  statement about the horrors of nuclear war... and wound up with several reels of  celluloid flotsam. Any self-respecting fan of bad cinema who hasn't seen this  notorious wreck of a movie isn't worth his or her salt.

A waterlogged game of cat and mouse, the plot is so contrived that even the most impressive action sequences--such as a jet-ski chase through flooded high-school corridors--are robbed of their already tenuous credibility. Before long you'll be yawning as incompetent accomplices are systematically dispatched by their own stupidity, in the kind of movie where the use of power boats inevitably leads to at least one death by outboard motor.

{"description": "Some critics and filmgoers have hailed this 1989 comedy-drama as Woody Allen's best film, and while that's certainly open for debate, a good case can be made that it's the most ambitious and morally complex of Allen's films. It's the kind of movie that provokes heated philosophical debate about the role of God in our lives, the nature of guilt, and the circumstances that would allow a seemingly good, law-abiding family man and successful professional (Martin Landau) to commit a murder with no risk of being caught. Could you live with yourself under those conditions? Allen explores this complicated issue in the context of an extramarital affair that Landau's mistress (Anjelica Huston) threatens to expose, while developing a second story about a documentary filmmaker (Allen) who reluctantly makes a film about his brother-in-law (Alan Alda), a TV sitcom producer whose vanity is seemingly unlimited. From serious crimes to misdemeanors of personal behavior, Allen ties these stories together to create a provocative and unsettling study of divergent moralities and the price we're willing to pay to preserve our personal comfort and happiness. It's a sobering film, but a fascinating and funny one as well, unfolding like a thriller in which the question is not whodunit but rather, would you do it if you knew you could get away with it?--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005O06J", "0767819764", "B000062XE6", "0792846109", "6304907729", "B00005O06N", "B000EQHXNW", "6305327068", "0792846125", "B00005O06M", "0792846087", "0792846117", "B00AEFYVUQ", "B003UESJCY", "B00005O06I", "6305291470", "B00005O06L", "B000IU37SO", "B00008978N", "B00005AUJH", "B00005AUJO", "6305428085", "B00003CXGS", "B005MYEQ4U", "B00A1O0G3G", "B00008L3SA", "B001DJ7PR8", "0792846060", "B00005AUJI", "B009UTX4M8", "B000AM6P2U", "0780622243", "1879505274", "B002LMV7RA", "B00004STRD", "B00013D580", "B0013D8LC2", "B00005O06K", "B00020X88E", "0792846095", "B006FSRSTC", "B00003CY6A", "0801031877", "B00005U8EN", "B00005JMON", "B00005O06O", "B00G7QPXUI", "B007NYZA0Q", "B00005AUJM", "B00JLDTBCU", "B000CNESU8", "B00005JL81", "B006FSRSFQ", "B00004WI55", "B00000JGOI", "B0064NTZKI", "B000021Y77", "B001G9F9IW", "0812978110", "1602585350", "B00006RCNV", "B008220DGE", "B000056KMW", "B00AEFXESQ", "B00005JKG9", "0802142036", "0792846052", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B00003CXC9", "B00HE010QM", "B00JAQJNN0", "B000GIXE86", "B001D8W7EK", "B0006TPDPM", "B000EBD9SU", "B000LXH0AE", "B00000K3CS", "B000Z8GZYW", "B00K0PA9ME", "B000TXNDV6", "B00A1O0G5E", "B00000G02H", "B00G7QPYX4", "B000069HZU", "B000063K2Q", "B0045HCJ9E", "B003102JDM", "B0009298N4", "B00005U2KC", "0767812158", "B00002E20R", "B00023P4JW", "B00AEFYSWM", "B00H9HZITU", "B00H9KKGTO", "B000ETRCN0", "B002LMV7QG", "B00HXH00ZI", "B00003CWRX", "0784011710"], "bought_together": ["B00005O06J", "0792846109"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0767819764", "B00005O06J", "6304907729", "0792846109"]}, "price": 39.95, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 323951}, "asin": "6305075328", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DH178S0SL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Crimes and Misdemeanors"}

As their friendship progresses, she learns she is pregnant, and wants Rudd to act as daddy to her newborn, much to the consternation of her overbearing boyfriend (John Pankow).The film takes itself too seriously, although there is some genuine emotion buried in Wendy Wasserstein's clunky script.  It is not that the relationships are unbelievable; it is that the story lurches forward from one stilted setup to another. And unfortunately, characters are motivated by unknown forces to take on major life changes without explanation. More fortunate are two very likable performances by Rudd, who wisely plays this without cute, homosexual tics, and a most perky and appealing Aniston.

And former Playboy Playmate Erika Eleniak seems to be enjoying the joke that in a movie filled with half-naked women, she's the only one who keeps her clothes on.--Geof Miller", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000AOX0C", "B004SUDQCW", "B000RXVNCO", "B000SULWKO", "B006BZ8NSE", "B003NKU9XM", "B002GHHHG0", "B0030E5PYO", "B000A88EU0", "B0053TWV46", "B000HD1482", "6305258287", "B000FFJYC0", "B0009ETCOW", "B00BTYPW7C", "B00DI012O2", "B000E1MXWS", "B00JJOY41E", "B004AC6PMG", "B00I462XF2", "B001AR0D5Y", "B00005NRN6", "B001B8XRT6", "6305090564", "B00006FI0R", "B008OR5X4O", "B000GYI322", "B002JHD9D2", "B00AEFYV9W", "B009T3AGVW", "B00C2R122Y", "B000053UIF", "B00CFK5J9U", "B00HHYGGBE", "B000EQ5V8G", "B0001611DI", "B00005NB8U", "B00AGKH4MG", "B005CFBZWK", "B000FWHW86", "B009IV2Z7S", "B00005LQ0Z", "B0024FAG44", "B00000K3TO", "B000WC39P4", "6305308810", "B004YCKJFG", "B002LMSWN2", "B00079Z9WI", "B00D7AM6M0", "B0011367SY", "0767817664", "B00HRCATDW", "B00AEFY2WI", "B0001VTPW2", "B00004REOG", "B00CERJIZA", "B0002S9QUA", "B000059XUP", "1573624101", "B00005N5RM", "B001U0HBQA", "157362618X", "0790750201", "B000E8M0P6", "B00A429Y9M", "B000G1R39E", "B004P7CN5O", "B000I2J68M", "B001AR4K8K", "B00BTYNXJG", "078321958X", "B00005O5B5", "B000JU7JIW", "B00HW3EZXQ", "B008DL4LN0", "B000SAGGSC", "B00JJ3EHCG", "B000VKL6Z2", "B004P7CM9Q", "B005CA4SEC", "B00DTPRZ10", "B001B1UO6W", "B000099T3M", "B0000648YR", "B000FS9FE4", "B00AKGG6XY", "B000P0J0E2", "B004WOAGIG", "B004P7CN7W", "B00AEFXR8I", "B00AEFY37C", "0792842960", "B000AM6OOY", "B0028DRGDQ", "B000HT38B2", "B00009PY3P", "B008JFUNYG", "B000068IEV"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000Q66Q56", "B004SUDQCW", "B0000AOX0C", "B000SULWKO"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 365293}, "asin": "630507755X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZX1986EFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Tales From Crypt: Bordello of Blood"}
{"description": "Basil Fawlty, as created and performed by John Cleese, is the rudest, most boorish, most hilariously obnoxious man on the face of the planet. What a natural for a TV sitcom! His screen wife, Sybil (Prunella Scales), put it best in the episode \"The Psychiatrist\": \"You're either crawling all over them, licking their boots, or spitting poison at them like some Benzedrine puff adder.\" He mockingly replies, \"Just trying to enjoy myself, dear.\" With his gangly frame and contortionist abilities, Cleese brilliantly punctuates Basil's outrageous faux pas with absurd gymnastics and turns Three Stooges-style pokes and kicks into a slapstick ballet. Scales's Sybil is the genial but obliviously chatty voice of reason and Andrew Sachs mangles the English language as the Spanish bellhop Manuel, whose struggles with simple directions results in comic lunacy reminiscent of Robert Benigni. After a six-episode run in 1975, Cleese and cowriter and costar Connie Booth (who plays Polly, the maid all too often pulled into Basil's ridiculous plans) reunited the cast in 1979 for another six episodes without missing a punch line. The four-volume collection contains all 12 shows, interspersed with interview segments featuring Cleese discussing the genesis of the series and anecdotes about the individual episodes. Remember to watch the opening credits of each show to spot the creative misspellings on the hotel sign (my favorite: \"Fatty Owls\").--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303631991", "6302293553", "B00004TJRU", "6304626495", "B000035P9O"], "bought_together": ["6303631991"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 434629}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 21.97, "brand": "", "asin": "6305076464", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5153HAF049L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Fawlty Towers - The Complete Collection [VHS]"}
{"description": "Matineeoffers one of the best matches of director and screenplay that you're ever likely to find. Raised on a steady diet of 1950s monster movies, Joe Dante later contributed to the genre with such films asGremlinsandExplorers, but it was Charlie Haas's script forMatineethat gave Dante a perfect platform for comedy, dramatic context, and nostalgic homage. Set in Florida during the Cuban missile crisis of 1962, the movie focuses on a schlock-movie promoter named Woolsey (inspired by real-life producer William Castle and played to perfection by John Goodman) who arrives in Key West with his latest Grade-Z extravaganza,Mant, about the raving half-man/half-ant product of \"science run amuck.\" (This movie-within-a-movie is a perfect tribute by Dante, who cast B-movie stalwarts in the kind of roles they'd built careers on.)Balancing youthful exuberance with the ominous threat of nuclear attack, Dante finds his alter ego in Simon Fenton, who plays a 15-year-old captivated by Woolsey's cheesy showmanship. This affectionate devotion is matched by Dante, who captures the anxiety of the missile crisis even asMatineedelivers an abundance of humor. Director John Sayles and Dante-movie veteran Dick Miller have cameos as Woolsey's show-biz accomplices, and Cathy Moriarty is brilliant as Woolsey's wisecracking mistress and Z-movie queen. All of this makesMatineea polished gem that's sweetly entertaining while staying true to the serious context of its story. It's the movie Joe Dante was born to direct.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000WN0SM", "B00K6D1R0I", "B00KUS5YGC", "B00441GYQ0", "B00E1HIWXU", "B00K6D1S7A", "B00KB614HQ", "B0000648ZQ", "B00000K3U3", "B00FUABK36", "B008LFYXDG", "B00GPPXNLC", "B00IO998U2", "B0000694WH", "B00005K3OV", "B000FWHW8Q", "B00L326LTI", "B00I099JZK", "B00DTECHWS", "B00ISSF7S6", "B00I3C1T1Q", "B000K7VHTQ", "B003THSXKU", "B0045HCJRG", "B00HRJVHKE", "B00KDU8HQQ", "B000FVQLKM", "B00GBT61YS", "1613778457", "B00008973H", "B001B9ZVVC", "B00K6J7FGC", "3901644520", "B00005LC4D", "B00BTYSIWI", "B000FFJZO2", "B00009PY45", "B0045HCJKS", "B000RXVNDI", "B00FUABHVQ", "078321958X", "B00AEFXPG2", "B00000IQC4", "B00I462XNO", "B00K6J7Q6G", "0792846060", "B00FM4S5O2", "B000FVQLKW", "B00CDEJRDC", "B000035Z38", "B0088EDONK", "B00I3C1T6G", "0991127900", "B00D9EJFZA", "B001NKWLBW", "B00BXRVQO8", "B0009X770E", "B001Q8MMCE", "B000CCW2UW", "B005STRKC4", "B00JJOY41E", "B000063UR3", "6305428514", "B002I41KNC", "B004Z1HY36", "B00IELX0C2"], "bought_together": ["B0000WN0SM"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AMDA2O4", "B0000WN0SM", "B00009AOAX", "B000067FP8"]}, "price": 37.9, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 347038}, "asin": "6305080453", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61M2PDWCASL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Matinee"}
{"description": "What do a down-and-out Broadway producer, his anxiety-attack-prone accountant, a go-go dancing Swedish secretary, and a Nazi playwright have in common? They're all part of Mel Brooks's wild and wacky first film, THE PRODUCERS. In this hysterical farce, rapacious but lovable producer Max Bialystock (Zero Mostel) hasn't had a hit in years and resorts to fulfilling sexually crazed little old ladies' fantasies for extra cash. But when he meets his new meek, neurotic accountant, Leo Bloom (Gene Wilder), the two accidentally come up with a plot to oversell shares in a surefire flop musical and make off with the profits. The plan sends the new partners-in-crime on a search for the worst play ever: SPRINGTIME FOR HITLER, written by an ex-Nazi (Kenneth Mars) whose only friends are the filthy city pigeons he keeps on his roof. Inspired, manic performances by all involved, along with Brooks's lively direction--which affectionately alludes to such MGM Golden Age musicals as SINGIN' IN THE RAIN--make THE PRODUCERS both referential and highly original as it moves along swiftly to the ultimate musical climax.", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301797973", "630281622X", "6305576173", "6300247112"], "bought_together": ["6301797973"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 552537}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 15.0, "brand": "", "asin": "6305112878", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/215KFPD56ZL.jpg", "title": "Producers [VHS]"}
{"description": "Jules Dassin's brooding, brutal drama about a prison wound to the  breaking point by a sadistic captain of the guards is a classic film noir as well  as one of the greatest prison films ever made. Burt Lancaster (in only his third film but already commanding the screen like a pro) is the savvy prison veteran whose clashes with Hume Cronyn (the ambitious guard with a god complex) land him first in solitary then in the claustrophobic drain pipe, a muddy, airless work detail that slowly kills every man assigned to it. With the help of his cellmate buddies and former gangland boss Charles Bickford he hatches a plan to break out, but Cronyn has his own plans for the unbreakable prisoner. Dassin's oppressive prison is thick with atmosphere: cavernous buildings and halls that echo with the footsteps of inmates and the clanking of bars, overcrowded cells that seem to close in on the men, a busy machine shop where the film's most memorable scene takes place--the ruthless assassination of a stoolie in a pounding metal press. Cinematographer William Daniels, a master of Hollywood's soft-focus glamour, creates a harsh, hard-edged look for the film, softened only by looming shadows. A sense of doom hovers over everything, culminating in an explosive finale, but the barbaric, brutish violence hangs in the air long after the film is over.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783217528", "0792837371", "6301973410"]}, "price": 23.94, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 463456}, "asin": "6305226156", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/217E31PPRKL.jpg", "title": "Brute Force [VHS]"}

{"description": "A little drunk on its own arcane exotica as a gambling movie,Roundersis a film that takes us inside a world of high-stakes card players but falls short on such essentials as character development, relationships, that sort of thing. Still, it is a real curiosity, written by a couple of guys (David Levien and Brian Koppelman) who appear to know something about the dark underbelly of card hustling for fun and profit. Matt Damon stars as a reluctant law student who can't put aside his subterranean career of playing poker and blackjack for big money. After he loses his post-grad nest egg to a weird Russian kingpin (John Malkovich)--and also loses his disgusted girlfriend (Gretchen Mol) in the process--Damon's character turns to an unreliable old buddy (Edward Norton) for a dangerous game of sharking wherever there happens to be a game underway: frat boys, cops, bad dudes, you name it. Norton appears to be living out every young actor's fantasy of re-creating Robert De Niro's prototypical head case in Martin Scorsese'sMean Streets, and while his performance is burdened by obvious quotation marks, his estimable talent still shines through. Damon's charm and intelligence bring some oomph to the curiously flat proceedings, and while his hushed, soul-bearing scenes with Martin Landau (as a law professor who takes a shine to the kid) seem gratuitous, they're still nice to watch. Behind all this is director John Dahl (Red Rock West), who is not exactly at the top of his game here but who brings his distinctive toughness to the crime-noir tone.--Tom Keogh", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 343634}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.18, "brand": "", "asin": "6305240655", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51565J9D9ZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Rounders [VHS]"}

{"description": "Based on thenovelby  Max Evans and directed by Stephen Frears,The Hi-Lo  Countrycharted a long and circuitous route to the big screen, and the final result  proves that the material posed a major--and perhaps insurmountable--challenge for  screen adaptation. It's easy to see why this contemporary Western was once a  coveted project of director Sam Peckinpah; its codes of honor, male bonding, and  hardened morality would've played nicely into Peckinpah's artistic legacy. There are  clear echoes of Peckinpah in the screenplay by Walon Green (who wroteThe  Wild Bunch), and while the movie is blessed by Woody Harrelson's vivid performance as a reckless latter-day cowboy, Frears fails to maintain a compelling  tone and the rest of the cast nearly fades into the background.Billy Crudup (Without Limits) plays Harrelson's best pal, just returned to  New Mexico from service in World War&nbsp;II with hopes of starting a cattle ranch free  from the greedy clutches of a local rancher (Sam Elliott) who dominates the town of  Hi-Lo like a bootclad kingpin. Harrelson joins in the effort, but tensions rise when he  connects with the sultry seductress (Patricia Arquette) with whom Crudup has fallen  inexplicably in love. Harrelson has provoked others as well, and he seems primed for  a fall, butThe Hi-Lo Countryis a film out of balance. Memorable moments  are found in abundance, and the film's period detail is impeccable, but Crudup's  character is so underwritten and underplayed that his role as narrator and ostensible  hero has minimal dramatic impact. By the time fate deals its inevitable blow, it's too  late to care.

{"description": "John Lasseter and his gang of high-tech creators at Pixar create another entertainment for the ages. Like the few great movie sequels,Toy Story&nbsp;2comments on why the first one was so wonderful while finding a fresh angle worthy of a new film. The craze of toy collecting becomes the focus here, as we find out Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks) is not only a beloved toy to Andy but also a rare doll from a popular '60s children's show. When a greedy collector takes Woody, Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) launches a rescue mission with Andy's other toys. To say more would be a crime because this is one of the most creative and smile-inducing films since, well, the firstToy Story.Although the toys look the same as in the 1994 feature, Pixar shows how much technology has advanced: the human characters look more human, backgrounds are superior, and two action sequences that book-end the film are dazzling. And it's a hoot for kids and adults. The film is packed with spoofs, easily accessible in-jokes, and inspired voice casting (with newcomer Joan Cusack especially a delight as Cowgirl Jessie). But as the Pixar canon of films illustrates, the filmmakers are storytellers first. Woody's heart-tugging predicament can easily be translated into the eternal debate of living a good life versus living  forever.Toy Story&nbsp;2also achieved something in the U.S. two other outstanding 1999 animated features (The Iron Giant,Princess Mononoke) could not: it became a huge box-office hit.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["6304089767", "B00005JKDQ", "B0000AQZYM", "6305326940", "0788805843", "0788812408", "155890641X", "6303314015", "0788802194", "B000035Z2S", "0788805533", "6305229449", "078881172X", "6304500831", "0788812807", "6302526574", "6302642248", "6303983812", "B00003CXQX", "6304401132", "0788806270", "6302787068", "6305940932", "6302320402", "6304290888", "6303534422", "B00275EHJG", "B00004T2SI", "6305319138", "B00005JL95", "0788803743", "6302178924", "6300274268", "6304100507", "6305942285", "B00004R99N", "6300275310", "B00006CXK5", "B00003CXXI", "B00005JMQY", "6304400225", "6304400551", "6302961572", "6303122647", "6304501153", "B00005JKX3", "0788811002", "6300274195", "B0000E32WB", "6303929338", "B00005T7H6", "6304978286", "B00005RDVV", "B00016JF2W", "6302158095", "B0000524CZ", "6304401736", "B000035Z46", "B00003CXHR", "0788812440", "6303036813", "6304089201", "B0007A2GSM", "B00000JS61", "B000028U3S", "B00005RRG3", "6301991311", "B00003CWPW", "B00009L4S1", "6304400381", "6300274608", "B00003CXQ6", "B00000I7Q3", "0788812181", "B000AY74OQ", "6305559295", "0792153677", "B00005LOUS", "0788809806", "078880720X", "B000009CTR", "1558906150", "B00001YX9H", "6301390725", "B00007AJLB", "B00000J2JA", "6304434340", "0783221800", "B00000ICHA", "1558907718", "6303148387", "B00004T2SJ", "6304155972", "6303939015", "0788810448", "6301404440", "630169774X", "B00003CXQ0", "6302968143", "B00006IUM9"], "also_viewed": ["6304089767", "6303314015", "B00005JKDQ", "B0000AQZYM", "0788805843", "6302787068", "0788812408", "6305326940", "155890641X", "0788805533", "0788802194", "6305940932", "6302320402", "078881172X", "6305229449", "6302526574", "6304500831", "B000035Z2S", "B00003CXQX", "6303983812", "6302642248", "6304100507", "6300274195", "6304290888", "0788812807", "0788806270", "6303036813", "6300274268", "6305319138", "B00005JL95", "6304501153", "6300275310", "B00004T2SI", "6303534422", "6305942285", "6302178924", "B00003CXXI", "6304401132", "6302961572", "B0007KTBIU", "6304400551", "6303929338", "6304089201", "B00004R99N", "6304978286", "B0000524CZ", "B00275EHJG", "B00005JKX3", "B00000I7Q3", "B00003CXHR", "6304089112", "6302426200", "B0000E32WB", "B00006CXK5", "B0030IIZ4M", "6305310068", "6304401736", "B00016JF2W", "B000063V8N"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 182756}, "asin": "6305949557", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515BCFM46JL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Toy Story 2 [VHS]"}
{"description": "Pixar genius reigns in this funny romantic comedy, which stars a robot who says absolutely nothing for a full 25 minutes yet somehow completely transfixes and endears himself to the audience within the first few minutes of the film. As the last robot left on earth, Wall-E (voiced by Ben Burtt) is one small robot--with a big, big heart--who holds the future of earth and mankind squarely in the palm of his metal hand. He's outlasted all the \"Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class\" robots that were assigned some 700 years ago to clean up the environmental mess that man made of earth while man vacationed aboard the luxury spaceship Axiom. Wall-E has dutifully gone about his job compacting trash, the extreme solitude broken only by his pet cockroach, but he's developed some oddly human habits and ideas. When the Axiom sends its regularly scheduled robotic EVE probe (Elissa Knight) to earth, Wall-E is instantly smitten and proceeds to try to impress EVE with his collection of human memorabilia. EVE's directive compels her to bring Wall-E's newly collected plant sprout to the captain of the Axiom and Wall-E follows in hot pursuit. Suddenly, the human world is turned upside down and the Captain (Jeff Garlin) joins forces with Wall-E and a cast of other misfit robots to lead the now lethargic people back home to earth. Wall-E is a great family film with the most impressive aspect being the depth of emotion conveyed by a simple robot--a machine typically considered devoid of emotion, but made so absolutely touching by the magic of Pixar animation. Also well-worth admiring are the sweeping views from space, the creative yet disturbing vision of what strange luxuries a future space vacation might offer, and the innovative use of trash in a future cityscape. Underneath the slapstick comedy and touching love story is a poignant message about the folly of human greed and its potential effects on earth and the entire human race.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000VBJEEG", "B001KVZ6FW", "B00007LVCM", "B00BG0RSJ4", "B00AFEX83C", "0736424229", "B00005JN4W", "B00005JNQS", "B0042U94UQ", "B00E9ZATJO", "B001OMU6UM", "B00005JNS0", "B0030IIZ4M", "B0034JKZ86", "B002ZG97YM", "B002WJI2QQ", "B004HO6I4M", "B008YWY0HK", "B0012EM5D8", "B0006UEVT0", "B009SZCC9U", "B004G600A4", "B00AAXFYPI", "B00F522C7C", "B008Z1LBU4", "B00CTNYLQA", "B003H9M1Q2", "B000AAF1TU", "B008JFUQ16", "B000ROAK2W", "B000AY74OG", "B00275EHJG", "B00CWM58WY", "B00009M9BK", "B00EV1YZ96", "B001DPHDCY", "B000MV9026", "B001O5LVPI", "0783231474", "B00CQRN3QI", "B00G5G7EXY", "B00I6JOD2S", "B001HN6922", "B00GDT5T9Y", "B0087F7VSY", "B001U2MQE0", "B0030IIYYS", "B00A83075M", "B00H4Z07Q6", "B005LAIH4A", "B000DWMYQ8", "B00CHVJODE", "B0000AOX0O", "B003UESJF6", "B00JK531ES", "B00HLTD2OE", "B0001I561E", "B00BGYO7HG", "B003ZHVJGO", "B001ILFUD2", "B0002YLCOM", "B0039N74CW", "B00004U9WQ", "B00937R6QC", "B00CUDD0C0", "B004EPZ034", "B00004R99S", "B00003CXB4", "B000065V42", "B00005RDSQ", "B004ZBACOE", "B001GCUO7A", "B00AO686JC", "B000AAF1U4", "B0006JMLRK", "B00005JMQZ", "B0043X1FOK", "B00C7JGDBW", "B001JRB17Y", "B001KVZ6G6", "B00005TN8K", "B00005JMFH", "B00E9ZATKI", "B001ILFUDC", "B000V1Y44G", "B00003CX8Y", "B0011U52E2", "B00EBBGLFC", "B000YERP2S", "B00009YXAW", "B00003CXCQ", "B002NZK5SW", "B000G75AZC", "B00CNW9ZI6", "B0084IHVGG", "B00947N6D8", "B004LWZW7Y"], "bought_together": ["B001KVZ6FW", "B000VBJEEG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004HO6I4M", "B001KVZ6FW", "B00I6JOD2S", "B00005JN4W"]}, "price": 17.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 319062}, "asin": "7883706837", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51u-jDIxUZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)"}
{"description": "Here's a movie that should convince anyone that law school is not for them--particularly Harvard Law School. Timothy Bottoms leads a group of would-be shysters through their first year at Harvard--which amounts to endless studying and backbiting as they try to memorize whole books at a sitting. As the grueling routine begins to get to them, each reacts to the stress in different way. Bottoms's character becomes consumed with winning the attention and approval of the school's crankiest teacher, the crusty Prof. Kingsfield, the role that won \"newcomer\" John Houseman an Oscar.

{"description": "Hidden throughoutCach&#xE9;is the sense that you should be watching every moment in this film closely, just as the protagonists are themselves being watched by someone unknown. Georges and Anne Laurent&#x92;s (Daniel Auteuil and Juliette Binoche) enviable lives are terrorized by the sudden arrival on their doorstep of a videotaped recording of their Parisian townhouse. It&#x92;s nothing but a long, unedited shot of the fa&#xE7;ade of their house, but it&#x92;s disturbing nonetheless. Soon another arrives, this time of the farmhouse Georges grew up in, and then another of a car driving down a suburban street, and a walk down a hallway to a low-rent apartment. Again the videos are benign but unsettling. Then the mystery becomes more threatening when they receive gruesome postcards depicting child-like drawings of bloody, dead stick figures. Georges believes he knows who the culprit is, but for reasons all his own  refuses to let his wife in on the secret. Clearly more is hidden here than just the identity of their stalker. InCach&#xE9;, writer and director Michael Haneke skillfully, methodically pulls back multiple layers of deception, like new skin being pulled off an old wound. he masterfully fuses elements of his predecessors to create a film that is haunting and memorable. There is Bergman's fascination with the complexity of relationships, the suspense and lurking danger of Hitchcock, and the unique cinematic sensibility of Antonioni. In fact, the provocative final shot is practically a tribute toThe Passenger--a lot of people will want to rewatch it many times to see what they can find in it (if, after watching it, you are still unsatisfied with the resolution, then watch the interview with Haneke in the DVD's special features for his insights). It's a film of great effect and intrigue. There are no easy resolutions, and the answers given in this mystery will only lead to more questions.--Daniel Vancini", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002BWP4A6", "B00006LPER", "B000SIWHAK", "B00386OWUC", "B00187FPC2", "B00062134E", "B000068MAL", "6305228876", "B0002DB52M", "B00AIBZLHS", "B002BWP3UC", "B000OVLBGC", "B000B9EYFW", "B002AG2NTI", "B0057GYODG", "B00005N89H", "B0036TGSJE", "B000G0O5IM", "B000MTEFP0", "B00092ZLEY", "B0012QE4PI", "B0019UGYAU", "B00005N8A9", "B00023P4N8", "B0007Z0NYQ", "B0001EFUFK", "B000EHQU3A", "B002VKB0M4", "B00151QYE4", "B00005JKJA", "B000N4SHOO", "B00HVOFP6W", "B00AIBZLR8", "B005KQVE1S", "B00K0MM4AM", "B004WPYO7E", "B00HE011DE", "B006KH6CF4", "B000N3T0DW", "B00008976W", "B0007OCG5G", "B000059HA5", "B000083C5F", "B00GPPXNQ2", "B00018D40O", "B002VECLXC", "B00AX7PGQS", "B003VA3JTA", "B00005QAPJ", "B00005OSLQ", "B003Y5H4R0", "B00HT2RTU6", "6305744114", "B00005K9O8", "B00429MM1K", "B002P7UCJK", "080215056X", "B000E5LEV0", "B00009W0U4", "B000EHQU30", "B000BRBA8S", "B00JJ3EHCG", "B00IGK6TH4", "B00005JLQW", "B0007GAG42", "B00000K3TS", "B00K72HVBC", "B00005NFZC", "B000HIVIQU", "B000N6TX1I", "B000OCY7JE", "B007A9EGG8", "B001CIOCLC", "B00AEBB89W", "B000N2HBIO", "B00CQ8HCSM", "B000EQ5V2C", "B000E6EGT6", "B000934FC2", "B0087IT8FK", "B002BWP3UM", "B0006Z2NCM", "B00GRA7M2G", "B00ATK015K", "6305999872", "B001AZJKKK", "B000GBEWNY", "B000GBEWPC", "B00F6SHGF8", "B00008976Y", "B000FVQM2Y", "B00H4IR3JC", "B004ODLUIU", "B0006IUE9I", "B004YCKKH8", "B00455JE58", "B002ZG4Q66", "B0081HLM2E", "B00AEFXN9G", "B0024FAG2Q"], "bought_together": ["B002BWP4A6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002BWP4A6", "B00187FPC2", "B0036TGSJE", "B00006LPER"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 17815}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.28, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B00000F7E6", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41CS99VVAKL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Cache (Hidden)"}

{"description": "It's difficult to create a film that's fast paced, exciting, and aesthetically appealing without diluting its dialogue.Run Lola Run, directed and written by Tom Tykwer, is an enchanting balance of pace and narrative, creating a universal parable that leaps over cultural barriers. This is the story of young Lola (Franka Potente) and her boyfriend Manni (Moritz Bleibtreu). In the space of 20&nbsp;minutes, they must come up with 100,000&nbsp;deutsche marks to pay back a seedy gangster, who will be less than forgiving when he finds out that Manni incompetently lost his cash to an opportunistic vagrant. Lola, confronted with one obstacle after another, rides an emotional roller coaster in her high-speed efforts to help the hapless Manni--attempting to extract the cash first from her double-dealing father (appropriately a bank manager), and then by any means necessary. From this point nothing goes right for either protagonist, but just when you think you've figured out the movie, the director introduces a series of brilliant existential twists that boggle the mind. Tykwer uses rapid camera movements and innovative pauses to explore the theme of cause and effect. Accompanied by a pulse-poundingsoundtrack, we follow Lola through every turn and every heartbreak as she and Manni rush forward on a collision course with fate. There were a variety of original and intelligent films released in 1999, but perhaps none were as witty and clever as this little gem--one of the best foreign films of the year.--Jeremy Storey", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 496767}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.74, "brand": "", "asin": "B000021Y74", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51KYAD2YAVL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Run Lola Run [VHS]"}

{"description": "Though set in Toronto and directed by Canadian Jeremy Podeswa,The Five Sensesevokes the emotional geography of Krzysztof Kieslowski'sTrois Couleurstrilogy. Mightn't the senses do as well as colors to signal a chance-driven world where urban isolates miss and make connections in gloomy corridors and apartments, overcast parks, rainy streets, half-finished constructions? But Podeswa's almost aimless cutting among a clutch of apartment dwellers (each identified with smell, sight, taste, hearing, or touch) is more like a warm bath in easy solutions (or sad songs) than a bracing glimpse into the human condition. A masseuse named Seraph (Gabrielle Rose,The Sweet Hereafter's bus driver) ministers to a weeping boy unable to recall when he was last touched, but she can't reach out to her own daughter (Nadia Litz), a self-loathing teen with a taste for voyeurism. Down the hall, a music-loving ophthalmologist (Philippe Volter) sinks deeper into loneliness as he begins to go deaf. Upstairs, Rona (Mary-Louise Parker), who designs gorgeous but inedible cakes, is unable to quite trust the joyously sensual appetite of her Italian-chef boyfriend. Searching for true love by smell, Rona's bisexual friend Robert (Daniel MacIvor) discovers passing pleasure in a designer perfume with the power to conjure an unexpected liaison. If this wereThe Sweet Hereafter, the fate of the little girl who goes missing at the start of Podeswa's film might shadow these \"sensualists\" into radical transformation, perhaps even parole them from the prison of self. ButThe Five Sensesnever gets that far under the skin. Still, there is something pleasantly hypnotic, even liberating, about the way Podeswa drifts lightly over surfaces, never getting caught in the net of narrative.--Kathleen Murphy", "related": {"also_bought": ["0790739267", "B0006Q948C", "B00005JMIJ", "B00000F6N8", "B006M3M5FM", "B0010DM3R4", "B0008ENIVQ", "B00023P4I8", "B0001I2BUI", "B00HOGBXS6", "B00005LPZW", "B0045HCJGW", "B004QC6HKA", "B005Z9MGRG", "B00008WJBX", "B00008K7AU", "B000FZEQCI", "B0040J1RX6", "B000ERVJPE", "B0079K4WEE", "B00H9HZITU", "B004YMATCY", "B0014GI6I2", "B004XYABMQ", "B00005Q4CS", "B0009GX1XI", "B005OZIV20", "B00DPUB59W", "B0000639HO", "0783230559", "B001EOQCMG", "B004SIP7VM", "B005KC4LNU", "B00GTZWUPS", "B0089AJELY", "B0006OJH5O", "B008GFZWGI", "0792846109", "B004HHX9OQ", "B00004U104", "B00005QW5T", "B00GMV8LIO", "B00166UFSY", "B000HEWEWG", "B004XVMCMG", "B004SIP71M", "B000E3L7DW", "B004AGN9HQ", "B00003CWQR", "B00000JWVU", "B001675Z10", "B0009XXHQ2", "B0015HZA70", "B00B2GQ0F0", "B00005BCP4", "B000A2X3SO", "B004V8W51E"], "bought_together": ["0790739267", "B00000F6N8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005LPZW", "B000FZEQCI", "0790739267", "B0008ENIVQ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 140283}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.35, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00003CXMJ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51YWARKX83L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Five Senses"}

{"description": "Attempting to do for Westerns what hisGuns of Navaronehad done for World War II action epics, director J. Lee Thompson craftedMackenna's Goldas a lavish, absurdly ambitious variation on Erich Von Stroheim'sGreed, resulting in a last-gasp Western so eager to encompass the genre's traditions that it turns into a big, silly, wildly entertaining mess. Gregory Peck surely had more serious intentions when he signed on, and he brings prestigious gravitas to his glum role as Marshall Mackenna, who gets shanghaied into searching for the gold-filled canyon of an elusive Apache legend. The rest of the 1969 film labors to undermine Peck's respectable demeanor; how else to explain Omar Sharif as a Mexican villain, Julie Newmar as a hot-blooded Apache temptress (with underwater nude scenes that were celebrated inPlayboymagazine), and a jaw-dropping finale that's so ridiculous it's impressive in spite of itself?Formerly blacklisted screenwriter Carl Foreman and composer Dimitri Tiomkin joined up to coproduce the film, and one can only imagine how Anthony Mann or Howard Hawks might've handled Foreman's sensible script. Thompson goes for scenic splendor, heavy action, and heavier emotions, casting everything at a fever pitch that's wildly enjoyable without betraying his \"serious\" intentions. A stable of Hollywood veterans (Eli Wallach, Raymond Massey, Edward G. Robinson, and others) appear in lively supporting roles--they're all dispatched in a garish Apache ambush--and Camilla Sparv is an ing&#xE9;nue with plenty of fighting attitude. Gold fever reaches its peak, along with some awesome special effects, and divine intervention reaches new heights of intensity. Top it off with Jos&#xE9; Feliciano's theme song, and you'll be in zany Western heaven.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000QRI1GW", "B000056H2H", "B0007PALJS", "B000EHSVWS", "B0007MAO0C", "B000MGTQ7U", "B00018D404", "B00AEBB8W4", "B000NQRR34", "B00AEFYPHA", "B00195I3OK", "B00083FZFY", "B00005JLV5", "B00BTYU3UI", "B00070HK2E", "B000031EGW", "B0014BQR1A", "B0007PALKC", "B0016LFG2Y", "B000KJU18C", "B000OT6V0U", "B00000K3D5", "B004I1K05M", "B00LC4PCRE", "B0007MANYY", "B00005LOL2", "B00BTYPW8G", "B003AWRMCO", "B004XWGZK0", "B00000I1KF", "B00195I3PE", "B00195I3P4", "B008JEJSB6", "B00008PC19", "B00005OSJQ", "B000274TKI", "B00AEFXFW6", "B00006672R", "B000EHSVSW", "B0045HCJTO", "B00K6D1QEK", "B004I1K05W", "B00AEFYSEA", "B00005LOL5", "B003RHZ666", "0792841662", "B000056H2J", "B000FTCLQC", "B0001GF2HY", "B000EHSVVY", "B000FTCLQW", "B0009NZ2OW", "B000BT96DW", "B000G6N0HI", "B00008CMT3", "B000EHSVW8", "B0001AVZBW", "B000EHSVUU", "B0018O4RT2", "B003552QXG", "B000056H2K", "B0007MANZS", "B004GJYRBY", "B000N3T0GY", "B000O599NA", "B000E5N6KW", "B00AEFXUL2", "B001LMAK88", "B000E1ZKJQ", "B00K2CHW48", "B00005N5S2", "B0007MAO02", "B00AMDA2OY", "B000O78L0U", "B0049985XW", "B0001Z3I0I", "B00005JP3X", "B00004XPPC", "B00005LOL3", "B000O599YE", "B0041ONFI0", "B00782O7UM", "B0008ENHUS", "B000059TFW", "B0006B2A7E", "B00AEFYL6K", "B000063UQO", "B000A1OG0Y", "B00AEBB932", "B0082LUFA4", "B001PYD0PC", "0792839056", "B00096S4BM", "B006VRRGOO", "B007RKFXQW", "B00005R23T", "B00006L92Y", "B00005LC4D", "B00008MTW5", "B000BITVBA"], "bought_together": ["B000056H2H"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00CQ9VEDK", "B000QRI1GW", "B000EHSVWS", "B000056H2H"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 27055}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 16.37, "brand": "PECK,GREGORY", "asin": "B00004TJJU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51F5Q4SSGVL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "MacKenna's Gold"}
{"description": "The primary appeal of dance movies is the dancing, with some added emphasis on the romance the art expresses.Center Stagewins on these counts, despite its reveling in overly familiar characters and formula plotting. Or maybe this reveling is responsible for what goofy fun this film is. The arduous task of becoming a professional ballet dancer is incarnated by many good-looking teens, all stock dance-film characters affectionately portrayed mostly by newcomers. But center stage holds Jody Sawyer (Amanda Schull), who may never be a great ballerina, but she's certainly one sexy jazz dancer. Then there's the arrogant genius (Ethan Stiefel), the dictatorial impresario (Peter Gallagher), the demanding instructor, the bulimic, the stage mother, etc. As we follow these characters, the message develops that one should let go and do what feels good. Jody may not be ballet material, but she scorches the stage when she's uninhibited. And that's really the fun of this movie, which is never seriously interested in ballet to begin with. One ludicrous scene depicts one of the dancers quitting because she realizes she never wanted to be a dancer to begin with but was pushed into it by her overbearing mother. She stands up to mom in the lobby of the auditorium where she's supposed to be performing, the music of her piece providing a syrupy backdrop to her little drama. When she's finished talking, she walks off to the audience's unwitting applause. The scene is so ham-handed you can't help but laugh at its audacity, if that's what it is. The rest of the film is not so overdone, but it's all fun.--Jim Gay", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301796535"], "bought_together": ["6301796535"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 412340}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.96, "brand": "", "asin": "B00004WMDT", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Z02KG9Y5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Center Stage [VHS]"}
{"description": "Like the movie itself, there's little in the supplementary materials forThe Patriotthat requires more than one viewing, but they're interesting while they last. \"The Art of War\" featurette purports to be a study of the film's elaborate battle logistics, but it offers only a cursory appreciation of sequence planning and stunt work. The \"True Patriots\" featurette is much better, examining the painstaking efforts toward authenticity in production design, artillery, and costuming. The visual effects featurette offers a study of several pivotal shots, displayed in triptych fashion (to show how effects are layered together from separate elements) and narrated by visual effects supervisor Stuart Robertson. Generous photo galleries are included, featuring shots of the primary cast, sets, and costumes (the last matched by a gallery of conceptual drawings), and the feature-length commentary by director Roland Emmerich and producer Dean Devlin is worthwhile, if not altogether essential.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEFXKUI", "B00AMSLDTM", "B00AEBBA36", "B00AEFY5B6", "B00001ZWUS", "0800177967", "B000A2WP7O", "B00008G8M4", "B00003CXTG", "B004AOECXI", "B002O3Z510", "B000065U1N", "B00005221M", "B00000G3PA", "B00AEFY0F2", "B000E5N6LG", "B002O3Z50Q", "B0001HLVS2", "079284646X", "B00003CXA6", "B008MIMWOY", "6304711905", "0783225733", "B002VWNID6", "B0002WZTOI", "B000P0J0EW", "B00009OOFA", "B000NOKFHQ", "0783231202", "B000P0J0EM", "B003U0AHBO", "B004SIP7TE", "B00003CXQA", "B0000TANUI", "0792839137", "B00011CZRE", "B00005B6JZ", "B0002DRDBY", "B00AEFXRRO", "B002AS464Q", "B000WGWQG8", "B00026L9CU", "B00005JN5E", "B00007GZYC", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00005ATZT", "B000067D1R", "B000U1ZV8K", "B00B0U2SFE", "B003AWRMCE", "6304806434", "B00AEBB932", "B00005JM6F", "B00005JL3T", "B002ZG997C", "B00AEFXVCU", "B000FI8MPW", "B000VKL6ZM", "B00319ECI8", "B005LAIGYQ", "B0045HCJT4", "B0008JIJ2O", "B002O3Z50G", "B00AZNEW5G", "B00008AOTO", "B000LP6KNU", "0783227973", "B002VWNIBI", "B004FQX5B6", "B00AEBB9WI", "B004IK30M8", "B004IK30MI", "B0007PALM0", "B00AEBBA0E", "B001TK80D4", "B000O77SRC", "B004SIP7ZS", "B000095WW8", "079283366X", "6305558167", "B00AEFXKOO", "B0007TKNM4", "B0002YLCG0", "B00003CXHJ", "B000MZHW40", "B000F48D4G", "B001BNFRB2", "B00AEFXYJA", "B000QXDED6", "0767817710", "B0004Z33EG", "B00005JN0W", "B003ASLJRC", "B00HEPE6MM", "0790729695", "B000FVQLRA", "B00004WG2F", "B008MIMWQW", "B000GG4Y32", "B0068FZ0O2"], "bought_together": ["B00001ZWUS", "B00AEBBA36"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00001ZWUS", "B00AEFY5B6", "B004AOECXI", "B000NOKFHQ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 2823}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.0, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B00004XPPG", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51NDFXHAW9L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Patriot (Special Edition)"}

{"description": "This is the firstHellraisersequel that doesn't bear the  imprimatur of creator Clive Barker, and that makes it a sequel that manyHellraiserfans will want to disown, but they shouldn't dismiss it altogether. Now under the control of Miramax producers Bob and Harvey Weinstein, the franchise takes an entirely new direction, andInfernois primarily a detective thriller in which a corrupt cop (Craig  Sheffer) takes on a case that will judge his soul and, ultimately, damn him  forever. His judge and jury will be Pinhead (Doug Bradley) and his legion of  twisted Cenobites, but before he can be tried and condemned, Sheffer's cop will watch as those around him are killed off one by one, leaving a trail of blood (and telltale severed fingers) that leads back to the torment of his own youth.So, what you really have here is a variation onIt's a Wonderful LifeandA Christmas Carol, with all the themes reversed to hellish extremes. The plot doesn't hold together all that well, but you can't fault the film for establishing and maintaining a heavily somber tone. This is pretty dark stuff, after all, and althoughHellraiserfans will lament that Pinhead's appearance is relatively brief, he's presented here in an intriguing new light--not merely an icon of pain and suffering, but a giver of counsel and justice to those (like Sheffer's cop) who arguably deserve the eternal anguish they will receive. Does that make Pinhead a good guy? If this otherwise lugubrious sequel achieves anything, it's that it raises that question and lets the viewer decide.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004YCKJFG", "B00006ADFZ", "B004XYOQOA", "B004P7CMPK", "B0053TWVIM", "B0056P6SOG", "6305972001", "B00004Y633", "B000I2J68M", "B002HML6YI", "B0080QOKZM", "B008874968", "B000MV8AC2", "B001AGNMFI", "B000099T3M", "B004P7CM9Q", "B001NPD9LS", "B00BM4Q4H6", "B00AEFY2WI", "B009IV2Z3M", "B00AEFY31S", "B000FA57UI", "B00005LQ0Z", "B00AEFY2AA", "B00005LC4Q", "B00AEFY37C", "B004TJWDJY", "B004AC6PMG", "B00AEFY2LO", "B004P7CNF4", "B000WC3864", "B000VKL6Z2", "B000FA57US", "B0031U8OEK", "B000096I9V", "0783227434", "B0052XU4BK", "B004SUDQ0Y", "B0000ALPFL", "B009B8YNGO", "B000FS9FE4", "B00005NRN6", "B00AEFY2E6", "B0002IQMAM", "B00006IUFV", "B004P7CNUY", "0783230451", "B004SUDQ9K", "B000MV8ABS", "B00EVU3RSW", "B00006LPHA", "B0001611DI", "B001D5C1R6", "B0016MJ6P6", "B002YICNE2", "B0001US7OA", "B0000AOX08", "B00CERJINC", "B001B1UO6W", "B0000CEB6Y", "B00D7AM6M0", "B0000AOX09", "B00B4VSUW4", "B00AEFYV9W", "B001AXOFR0", "B0053TWW9K", "B002KH4KSY", "B000Q66Q8I", "B001JV5BIA", "0780630874", "B005CFBZQ6", "B00005N5RM", "B00006FDBT", "B004P7CNN6", "B0026UZHS2", "B00005JO16", "B0091G7BTM", "B000KJU1KK", "B0033B5XCS", "B000LC3ID8", "B0001LQJMQ", "B0050UEVN2", "B0058S0OMS", "B007I1Q4W2", "B000067FP8", "B0054602SU", "B005J9ZFQG", "B00AEFY1V0", "B000NVT0SO", "B000063US5", "B0009X76PK", "B00079Z9WI", "B00006FI0R", "B00105303S", "B002V3HT2G", "B005QX8UEE", "B00AEBB91E", "B0053FANPY", "B00005N5S5"], "bought_together": ["B004YCKJFG", "B004XYOQOA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0056P6SOG", "B004XYOQOA", "B004YCKJFG", "B008874968"]}, "price": 6.44, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 170962}, "asin": "B00004Y634", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/511F5VDVMNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Hellraiser: Inferno"}

Too bad director Dominic Sena (Kalifornia) doesn't come across as more of a gearhead; he seems less interested in fast cars than fast cuts. But is this movie fun? Absolutely, and it's funbecauseit's so stupid.

{"description": "Watch teen-pop queen Britney Spears cavorting in the sun and surf inLive and More!Part concert video and part travelogue, it features eight songs performed live on Hawaii's Waikiki Beach, including of course hits from her smash albumOops!... I Did It Again, in front of thousands of enthusiastic fans, the youngest of whom can be spotted mouthing the words while perched on their big sisters' shoulders. These songs are interspersed with clips of her \"down time\" in Hawaii: learning to hula at the Polynesian Cultural Center, playing with a dolphin, holding a dance rehearsal at Waimea Falls, and parasailing. She also gives an impromptu pizza party at the home of her \"No. 1 fan\" and drops in on a classroom--photo ops, sure, but also a genuine thrill for the kids.Completing this grab bag are three music videos (\"Oops!... I Did It Again,\" \"Stronger,\" \"Lucky\") and clips from when she hostedSaturday Night Live. Most of the sketches (\"Woodrow the Homeless Man,\" \"Britney Judges Dance Tryouts\") require her to play herself, but she does stretch out (a little) as author Dawn Paslowski on the fictional talk showMorning Latte.  She also performs \"Oops!... I Did It Again\" and \"Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know\" on the show and pokes fun at gossipmongers by noticeably padding herself.

{"description": "A double bill starring Frosty:Frosty the SnowmanJimmy Durante narrates this Christmas story that is based on the song of the  same name. To make up for the fact that her students are in school on Christmas  Eve, the local schoolteacher hires the magician Professor Hinkle to entertain  the kids. Unfortunately, he's not a very good magician. Frustrated in his attempt to pull a rabbit out of his hat, he throws it away in anger. Outside, the kids build a snowman (what to call it? Harold? Oatmeal? Frosty!), and when the hat blows onto it--Happy Birthday!--it comes to life. Professor Hinkle decides he wants the hat back so he can make money off of its newfound magical properties, but the kids want to save Frosty. When the temperature starts to rise, a new problem threatens Frosty's existence. Karen, the leader of the children, comes up with a plan to save him: take him on a train to the North Pole, where it's always cold. With a cameo by Santa Claus, and the promise of Frosty's return every year, this  story of life, death, and holiday cheer is glazed with the sweet frosting of  hope and happiness. A true holiday classic.Frosty ReturnsIn the same way that many a Hollywood sequel has little to do with the first film,Frosty Returnshas almost nothing in common with the originalFrosty the Snowman, aside from a man made of snow. The biggest difference is that this Frosty doesn't need a magic hat to come to life. The story: In the town of Beansboro, old Mr. Twitchell has invented an aerosol spray that can remove snow without the hassle of shoveling or plows. This frightens Frosty, who enlists the help of amateur magician Holly and her friend Charles to stop the old coot. Made in 1992,Frosty Returnshas an animation style that looks like a cross between the old Schoolhouse Rock and Peanuts cartoons, with voice talent that includes Jonathan Winters, Andrea Martin, Jan Hooks, Brian Doyle-Murray, and John Goodman as Frosty. The story may be divisive, pitting children against adults and a pro-snow contingent against anti-snow people, but the songs are catchy and the message is one that ultimately empowers kids. Like a hero from an old Western, this Frosty is a wanderer who leaves when his job is done so he can work his magic elsewhere.--Andy Spletzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B003P3PQOO", "B000R7G6KO", "B0002M5U7E", "B002JUFPUE", "B001CO42J8", "B005AU4SBC", "B000S0PLGA", "B000GFRI7M", "B000R7G6KY", "B001CO32FS", "B003U0AHG4", "B001NPDO90", "B0002M5U6A", "B00005NB93", "B003P3PQMQ", "B00004VVP9", "B00006II5M", "B008NNY8A4", "B00005LOUP", "0307960382", "B001CW8016", "B000HT3PPG", "B008GY0POI", "B0006IIOIQ", "B000AGTPUK", "B00004TS0E", "B000VBIGCW", "B000BVM1T6", "B000S6LP5A", "B001D7T6AE", "B0057FGCJQ", "B000R7G6JK", "B002VA5A16", "B0006419KA", "B00005N7Z0", "B001DPHDBA", "6305950547", "B00008N6NQ", "B000HEWEJO", "B005QODEEE", "B003NFM3JK", "B00DZP1BOG", "B001CO32FI", "B0019KAQEU", "B00DZP1BKK", "0545450055", "B002MU4NN6", "B001CO42IO", "B000VBIGD6", "B005BYBZPY", "B002VA5A0M", "B0052OPJ1E", "B000068TR1", "0824956567", "B002K2KMMW", "B005MQXZGI", "0375875115", "B003X3BYG0", "B000YABV7W", "B003YCIE68", "B00DGWZK0Y", "B000OLGCIE", "0824919106", "B002HQZX8Y", "B002WZUNX0", "B000HC2LH6", "B0009OUAZW", "B000TJBN6W", "B00275EHJG", "B003Z8ZCFW", "B00DS79H9C", "6301752627", "B0000694ZS", "B00005MEPA", "B001DJLD1W", "B0010KP374", "B0010DM4EG", "1623540127", "B00G5G7EXY", "B006942FGS", "B00008X5J7", "B007FC393G", "B00F522C7C", "B0000AI42B", "B00005K9OF", "B001U7NVXA", "B00DZP1BJ6", "B0002F6BRE", "B00GDT5T9Y", "B00CNW9ZI6", "B005BXY1R4", "B003H9M1Q2", "0395389496", "B008UY8FI2", "B00006JZI2", "B000002QUV", "B00G5G7K7O", "B0030IIYYS", "B0007A0F4E", "B00EEBNCI8"], "bought_together": ["B003P3PQOO", "B002JUFPUE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003P3PQMQ", "B0057FGCJQ", "B003P3PQOO", "B002JUFPUE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 314489}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 24.95, "brand": "Sony Pictures Home Entertainment", "asin": "B000051XIW", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51VYMT32SWL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Frosty the Snowman/Frosty Returns"}

{"description": "It's a good thing Sandra Bullock knows her strengths and weaknesses, because without Bullock as star and producer,Miss Congenialitywould be an insufferable mess as opposed to being a mildly enjoyable trifle that is custom-made for Bullock's established screen persona. Only Bullock's fans could really appreciate this fluff (even then they'll wish its ripe premise had been more intelligently handled), but it's not without some highlights to accompany Bullock's reliable charms. Here she plays clumsy, nerdy FBI agent Gracie Hart, who is given the horrific pseudonym Gracie Lou Freebush (one example of the movie's juvenile tendencies) when assigned to infiltrate a beauty pageant to investigate threats of a terrorist attack.Transforming Bullock from frumpy to stunning is a piece of cake (although she gives pageant coach Michael Caine a run for his money), so the movie's premise is trivial at best. More enjoyable is her character's uncouth disdain for pageant contestants and her mistaken perception that they're all a bunch of bimbos. The movie nicely charts Gracie's realization that her own pageant makeover provides a much-needed ego boost. In addition to Caine's effortless scene-stealing, pageant host William Shatner and organizer Candice Bergen are smart choices for comedic support (Shatner's a perfect Bert Parks wannabe), but the movie desperately needs a credible foundation for its comedy to really pay off. Bullock's bureau boss (Benjamin Bratt) is an unconvincing dimwit, and none of the plotting is as smart as sayBeverly Hills Copin combining procedure with laughs. That leaves Bullock to carry the burden of a comedy that just barely works in her favor.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0009KA2OA", "B00005O5CM", "B00005JM55", "6304765266", "B002K0WBXW", "B00081U7HC", "B00AEFXO8Q", "B00003CXSM", "B00006ZXSL", "B00008NRI7", "B002VECM6S", "B00007E2F5", "B0006GANOQ", "B00AEBB8NS", "B00003CXMP", "B0000524E5", "B00AEFY99O", "B00006FMUW", "B000HEWEE4", "B002NZK5V4", "B000YDBPAM", "B000QQLVPQ", "B00AEBB8R4", "B000CEV3M8", "B002O3Z50G", "B004SEUJK0", "B000J4QW7W", "B00E8RKHWW", "B002O3Z4ZW", "B00AEFYM2S", "B000209KMW", "B00AEFY4CG", "B00006ZXSK", "B0045HCJJ4", "B00447L4KA", "B00AMEZDJW", "B00008WJD6", "B0000897EG", "B000QUU4LY", "B000MQC9H4", "B00AEFXYOA", "B0000DIXDR", "B000XT1P3E", "0800177258", "0783225504", "B000NA1WE0", "6305236569", "B000023VTP", "B000FO0A9W", "B002SYAGNC", "B001ECDVK4", "B00003CXFV", "B00AEFYF2K", "B000J103OI", "B00005JG6N", "B0036TGSIK", "B00466HN7M", "B00000G3PA", "B0000AOV4I", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00AEFY5TI", "B0015I2RT8", "B001ECDVJU", "B004SIP8JI", "B00005KAQP", "B000ELJAEM", "B0049TC88U", "B002NZK5UU", "B00006ZXSQ", "B00008G8M4", "B004SIP9RO", "6305212112", "B000A343RI", "B004SIP9X8", "0783225733", "6302077818", "B002GHHHP6", "B002GIBVWA", "B00AEBB9WI", "0800141806", "B000683VI4", "B00795C5X4", "B002NZK5RS", "B00003CXTA", "B000JYW5BE", "B00005JM9Q", "B004EPZ070", "B00AEFXZJE", "B003L20IHE", "B007L6VMDK", "B0038N9X3Q", "B00386EZKE", "B000CCBCAI", "B00007BKVC", "0783235070", "B00AEFXWXI", "B000CEV3KU", "B00005BCKF", "B00AEBB8YW", "B0006N2EZ0"], "bought_together": ["B00005O5CM"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000NA1WE0", "B003PIUIJC", "6304765266", "B00005O5CM"]}, "price": 9.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 77252}, "asin": "B00005AAA9", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514V9KPFJRL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Miss Congeniality"}

{"description": "A smart and savvy (albeit highly stylized) look at the single lives of four thirtysomething Manhattan women,Sex and the City: The Complete Second Seasonbuilds on the foundation of its first season with plot arcs that are both hilarious and heartfelt, taking the show from breakout hit to true pop-culture phenomenon. Relationship epiphanies coexist happily alongside farcical plots and zingy one-liners, resulting in emotionally satisfying episodes that feature the sharp kind of character-defining dialogue that seems to have disappeared from the rest of TV long ago. When last we left the NYC gals, Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) had just broken up with a commitment-phobic Mr. Big (Chris Noth), but fans of Noth's seductive-yet-distant rake didn't have to wait long until he was back in the picture, as he and Carrie tried to make another go of it. Their relationship evolution, from reunion to second breakup, provides the core of the second season. The fittingly titled and keenly observed episode \"Evolution\" found Carrie trying to leave a few feminine belongings at Mr. Big's apartment with little success, charting the challenges and limits of intimacy. And the season's finale, \"Ex and the City,\" was a melancholy goodbye for Carrie and Big that took its cue fromThe Way We Were. It wasn't all angst, though: among other adventures, Charlotte (Kristin Davis) puzzles over whether one of her beaus was \"gay-straight\" or \"straight-gay\"; Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) tries to date a guy who insists on having sex only in places where they might get caught; and Samantha (the exquisite Kim Cattrall) copes with dates who range from, um, not big enough tofartoo big--with numerous stops in between. Through it all, the four actresses cohered into a solid ensemble that played on their complex relationships among themselves as well as with men; in two short years, Parker and company became one of the best TV casts in over a decade. And to top it all off, the second season offers 18 episodes, six more than the first. Sometimes size really can make a difference!--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00004RFCM", "B00382S9SW", "B00382S9T6", "B00382S9TQ", "B00382S9U0", "B00382S9UA", "B00AYVDUPW", "B00AQ5RRJQ", "B002ZG98Z0", "B001DDBCUA", "B001675YWK", "B00IKX4LEK", "B001675YW0", "B005IFIUEU", "B0002SDY1W", "B006WZIB1C", "B00FKNR3W0", "B00AS870P2", "B002ZG98ZA", "B000P6YNTI", "B000FIMG4U", "B00AIQAS76", "B00079FUI6", "B001VPJZ0O", "B00009Y3RW", "B000FIMG5Y", "0446617687", "B0000844MI", "B000CNGCAM", "B000G1R3A8", "B0018CWEYO", "B001DDBCV4", "B001VPJYZK", "B0002I84FS", "B0018CWEXK", "B003TNW04Y", "B004SEUJK0", "B00005JO9J", "B000P6YNSO", "B00382S9SM", "B000NA78SE", "B00062IDZQ", "B00466HN7M", "B0001907BW", "B0058YPNPK", "B00684J49U", "B00GOC74Z2", "B00003CXC5", "B0002UE1WQ", "B009Z5BPZK", "B0009CTVLS", "B000068CNX", "B004UXUWOW", "B0008KLV8M", "B003TNW02G", "B00003CXOP", "B000BYA4I8", "B0001CCXZW", "B000BDH6AI", "B003TNW030", "B0018QPPXW", "B00GB0ORJ8", "B003F3NE1Q", "0792844874", "B003IB0FUS", "B005IA9JVI", "B003F3NDP8", "B002N5N4DA", "B008LCRAFC", "B00ATP24DW", "B00079Z9VO", "B003R0MEW2", "B0007YXRCW", "B008L0YMUK", "B006ISJQ1W", "B003F3NDW6", "B0038N9WKU", "B008L0YN6I", "B0037QGS0A", "B000NJISIY", "B002HK9IMW", "B001MVWMIO", "B002G1K82Q", "B000IMUYJM", "B00005JN4H", "B009TE9GNK", "B004A8ZWVK", "B009RX7WTI", "B000EHSV5K", "B003L77GQ0", "B0030Y11XS", "B003L77G06", "B00AB65SVE", "B00AEFY5TI", "B0024FAR5M", "B004EPZ084", "B0092Q82LC", "B000V86OKG", "B000YABIQ6"], "bought_together": ["B00382S9SW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00382S9SM", "B00004RFCM", "B00382S9SW", "B00382S9UA"]}, "price": 25.98, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 39965}, "asin": "B00005AVCA", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51nsgO17NKL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Sex and the City: Season 2"}
{"description": "The first DVD released with the \"Infinifilm\" label,Thirteen Daysis the perfect vehicle for the extensive extras loaded on this single disc. If you enable the Infinifilm feature, a pop-up window will appear every few minutes during the film. Select one of the options and you're whisked away for a 30-second to three-minute feature on numerous topics relating to the onscreen action, including documentary footage of the actual events described in the film, cast and crew interviews, a making-of feature on the film, filmographies, deleted scenes, and historical biographies. (All the special features are also available in their entirety in the Special Features area of the disc.) Each segment is labeled with its length, and when the feature is done, you are automatically returned to the same point in the film. It's a nice way to take a second, more in-depth look at the movie. Historians, news broadcasters, and even Khrushchev's son lend their voices to one commentary track, which also includes historic speeches. The other commentary track includes key filmmakers and insights from producer-actor Kevin Costner. The short deconstruction of the jet-flyover special effects is superb, as is the subtitle option that offers historical text about the onscreen action that can be engaged with or without the Infinifilm mode.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JXI7", "B000CEXEWA", "B004FQX59I", "B009B0L5D6", "B00000IQC0", "B000E1NXJ0", "B001KGDNAW", "B00EO10IEE", "B00DDY45DI", "B004GJYRI2", "B001TH92N4", "0393318346", "B00004XPPE", "B00AHTYI5M", "B000055Y0X", "0783225733", "B00026L9CU", "B000BITUKC", "B00008W2OX", "B0013XZ2QK", "B0007R4T3U", "B00001ZWUS", "B000KX0IOA", "B009AMANBA", "B000059TFO", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00701QYIE", "0783231202", "B0001L3LUE", "B004YDSNMQ", "B003C27X44", "B00AEBB9NM", "B000MEYJHY", "B00CLH08KC", "B001AMHNKW", "B001GLX6UI", "6301971345", "B001MVWFAO", "B002PTVMWO", "B00EV4EUT8", "B000KJTG0G", "B00A144O20", "B00319ECI8", "B0000AMRUP", "B00003CXFV", "B0015NORDW", "B001ILFUBE", "B00ENP2QZA", "B00005JMA5", "B000EHSVS2", "B0000DJZ8R", "B0032LV4MM", "B00441GYOM", "B0038RSJB4", "B00AMHFPK6", "B004LWZVZC", "B00020X88Y", "B00KFNF2DM", "B0001WTVUW", "B00DUX292G", "B002RB56YU", "B00005JL8F", "B009NNM9OA", "B00B4TAXXK", "B0010YSD7W", "B004AOECXI", "B00005B6JZ", "B000060MW1", "B00003CXTG", "B0045HCJHQ", "B00JA3RVG4", "B0002V7ON8", "B00IXQV34U", "B0006FYOTC", "B003UESJEM", "B004TPJN3C", "B002GHHHME", "B0031WNYHK", "B00HLSW6II", "0767817729", "B00008K76V", "B00005JKZH", "079284646X", "B00BTYOYK8", "0783230532", "B0068FZ0GK", "B0060ZJ7BC", "B000EHSVSC", "B0002I833Q", "B00DT55OBI", "B0012QCZ5O", "B00AEBBA36", "B0002DRDBY", "B0087DFIYA", "B00005N5S3", "0792844874", "B00005JKBC", "B005BSCPY0", "B00000JGHL"], "bought_together": ["B004FQX59I", "B000CEXEWA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000CEXEWA", "B004FQX59I", "B004GJYRI2", "B00EO10IEE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 7804}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.96, "brand": "New Line Studios", "asin": "B00005J760", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51PVTBBHMSL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Thirteen Days (Infinifilm Edition)"}
{"description": "\"Their cheer blew like a bulimic after Christmas dinner,\" sneers Lisa (Marla Sokoloff fromDude, Where's My Car?), a bitter B-squad cheerleader who has it in for the A squad. She's come to the police to solve the mystery of a local bank robbery--a story that begins when head cheerleader Diane (Marley Shelton,Pleasantville,The Bachelor) and star quarterback Jack (James Marsden,X-Men,Disturbing Behavior) fell in love. Before you know it, Diane's knocked up--but she and Jack are delighted and decide to get married. Their parents disown them immediately, so the young couple ends up in a crappy apartment, working low-wage jobs. They're both so unrelentingly earnest and cheerful that they won't lose heart, but Diane soon realizes that their incomes won't support their impending twins. Then, one night as she and her squad (including Mena Suvari ofAmerican Beauty) are watchingPoint Break, they get the idea to rob a bank...Sugar & Spice, a broad satire of high school hierarchy, is set to a sparkling pop soundtrack and features many, many shots of cute cheerleaders in tight sweaters and short skirts. The cast is enthusiastic; Sokoloff in particular seems to savor her atypically nasty role. Also featuring cameos by Jerry Springer, Kurt Loder, and an almost unrecognizable Sean Young (Blade Runner,Ace Ventura: Pet Detective).--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00441GYVK", "0780628306", "6305428425", "B00003CXMP", "B00005MEVO", "B004SUDQ1I", "B000065K5H", "B00008K7AM", "B00001PE4D", "0767808673", "B00003CXUP", "B004P7CN7W", "B00005JKJS", "B00004RF85", "B00006ADFT", "B00005JCCB", "B00003CXK7", "B00003CXGJ", "B00005JKWM", "B00002SSKI", "B0053TWVQ4", "B0000CDRVU", "B00441GYVA", "B00AEFXO8Q", "B00447L4KA", "6305870179", "B00004W4UD", "B001GC9VK6", "078322933X", "B004GJYRA0", "B000J4QW7W", "B0009P42WI", "B000021Y7E", "B004SIP9X8", "B00005K3OS", "B002XUBDRY", "6305907110", "B0002OXRSG", "B00005JN0Z", "B0018CNNV2", "B00AMEZDJW", "B000A343RI", "B00094ARJ6", "6305017115", "B005Z9MFRC", "B0021L8UPS", "B00009MEB8", "B000AM4P9K", "B00AEBB9GY", "B0047HXMIY", "B000784WYA", "B000069HQ2", "B000068MC1", "B0071HPORY", "B00008G7UM", "B0001LJCKC", "B0000AKCJK", "B00005JOZC", "B00003CXWM", "B00005JLYW", "B00006ZXSL", "B00013RC2K", "B00AEFYM2S", "B0010X5X4O", "B000W1SZA4", "0783225482", "B0002VYOVI", "B000BTIU4S", "B00005U8QN", "B00ATP24DW", "0767827740", "0783227337", "B000A5045Q", "B00009MEC4", "B000060MWR", "B00008979B", "B008Y1YK5S", "B000A0GXF6", "B002DOBGWM", "B00000F0AD", "6305531293", "B000MM0LIM", "B004HY3BUQ", "B00BUUT19A", "B002JUFPUY", "B000069HYG", "B0000524E5", "B001KX50AG", "B00E1HIXEI", "B00005MEV3", "B000GB775E", "B000WC39MM", "B00005JMCW", "B000E6EHE0", "0792840127", "B00005V9I9", "B00003CXPS", "B0000541TK", "B0039PGHB4"], "bought_together": ["B00441GYVK", "6305428425"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00441GYVK", "0780628306", "6305428425", "0767808673"]}, "price": 27.67, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 21762}, "asin": "B00005J761", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51VXF7EGBML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Sugar &amp; Spice"}

{"description": "Heavy on atmosphere and light on everything else,From Hellis visually impressive while lacking the depth of the acclaimed graphic novel it's based upon. Making their third feature since 1993'sMenace II Society, twins Allen and Albert Hughes approach the Jack the Ripper case with physical precision, re-creating the gritty Whitechapel district of 1888 London in meticulous detail. What they've forgotten is the sheer terror that gripped Whitechapel in the wake of the Ripper's slaying of five prostitutes, investigated here by a Scotland Yard sleuth (Johnny Depp) who uses opium, laudanum, and absinthe to fuel his semiprescient visions of the slayings. Heather Graham attempts a slippery Cockney accent as a would-be victim, while Ian Holm steals the show as a has-been surgeon with devilish delusions of grandeur. Violence is obliquely suggested or briefly graphic, but no matter how you cut it,From Hellis only marginally thrilling as it treads familiar territory.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEBBA72", "B000NQRR1Q", "B004P7CNC2", "B00005R87R", "B000F7CECK", "B00AEBBAEK", "B00000IRE6", "B002QEHPQU", "B0002234LS", "B008QE9XD2", "B0000VD04M", "B0009UZG0K", "0780621611", "B006ISJQ1W", "B004SIP7PS", "B0000AC8LI", "B00347AIOE", "B00003CXWV", "B003HKN52U", "B001HN69AY", "B000053VAZ", "B000TGJ80S", "B0012Q7M02", "B00AEBB9F0", "B002Q3MYA8", "B00C888MJ8", "B00004XPPB", "B000FDEV3Y", "0780628551", "0783229526", "B001HN694K", "B0000WN140", "B0009IOR6Q", "B00F84H73Q", "B00003CXRG", "B001GCUO0W", "B004A8ZWSS", "B004SIP6BI", "B00004W4UB", "B000N2HDJQ", "B000C3L27U", "B000GCFO0I", "B000BB1MI2", "B005S9EJ8W", "B0009XRZKQ", "B00AEBB89W", "B008R65Y28", "B001I04QCO", "B00008LUNW", "B00005JLKN", "B003Y5H54W", "B0012QE4Q2", "B00DZP1C2W", "B00AEBB8NI", "B00JPFTX5O", "B0000TPA0G", "B001AGXEAG", "B0041KKYEM", "B00J5JSV3A", "B000069I1I", "B002UOMH00", "B004SIP92O", "B001A50716", "B005LAIHYU", "B0002KVUKM", "B005COPWZW", "B0036BDQ7Y", "B000UJ48P4", "B004SIP7TE", "B0031U8OEK", "0783116934", "B005LAIHXQ", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B000063US5", "B00005JLQN", "B00DHD933W", "B002AF4Y9G", "B000LP6KNU", "B008JFUNYG", "B0021L8V34", "B001D2WU9I", "B007XF0W3K", "B003AWRMBU", "B00009MEKN", "B00HRCATDW", "B0020PFYHC", "B00003CXKM", "B004SUDQ4A", "B0010DR4BO", "B0097C046W", "B00IKM5LXG", "B000FAOC2W", "B004SIP9Z6", "B00K6D1RVW", "B002ZG97CO", "B00151QYXU", "B005LAIH2C", "6301971345", "6304712499", "B003H5WF3U"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AEBBA72", "B004P7CNC2", "B00005R87R", "B000NQRR1Q"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 164982}, "asin": "B00005JKJM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/418JG1F78JL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "From Hell (Two-Disc Special Edition)"}
{"description": "The plethora of extras on this two-disc set are worth your time. There are several well-produced segments on the physical aspects of the film highlighted by a tour of the vast Cinecitt&#xE0; Studio sets with director Martin Scorsese and production designer Dante Ferretti (with a 360-degree-view feature to boot). Historian Luc Sante introduces you to the Five Corners area in New York circa the mid-19th century, and there's a vintage vocabulary guide (from the 1859 edition ofThe Rogue's Lexicon). Even though it was made as a \"puff piece\" for the movie, the Discovery Channel show \"Uncovering the Real Gangs of New York\" is an informative half-hour on the film's historical background. There's another espresso double-shot from a Scorsese commentary track. Not recorded traditionally as he watches the movie, the track pieces together thoughts from the director including some recorded in an NPR interview. This allows Scorsese to be even more focused, dealing with the history of the time and his own 30-year struggle to make the film. One serious demerit for stretching the feature film over both discs, which most likely had to be done with having both Dolby 5.1 and DTS tracks along with the commentary on the long film.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000M341QE", "B00AEBB9CS", "B00080ZG10", "B00AEBB8NI", "B006OFN0SE", "B00005JLSB", "B000C20VPA", "B000MZHW40", "B001N44BVQ", "B002ZG980U", "B000P0J09M", "B00049QQHI", "B004SIP8ZM", "0767830555", "6305313687", "B0006GAOJA", "B00008975Z", "B0016Q2D66", "B0000DI87S", "B00008DP4C", "B00011CZRE", "B000P0J0EW", "B00004XPPB", "B008R65XYC", "B005LAIIJY", "B0007DFJ0G", "B000C20VRS", "B004SIP95G", "B000286RP2", "B002CPMB9O", "B002T9H2LA", "0307388980", "B004SIP7ZS", "B000A7DVR2", "B00AEFXKUI", "B008MILL8W", "B00AEBB9F0", "B001EZE5DI", "B00AEBB9NM", "B004FQX5B6", "B002QEHPQU", "B004SIP9Z6", "B00H9KKGTO", "B004SIP6GI", "B002VWNIEA", "B0001FGBUW", "B000A2UBN4", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B00003CWM3", "B008D1Q1VA", "B00005V9HH", "B003ASLJQI", "B003ASLJQS", "B007SPPANM", "B000093FLA", "B00003CXZ4", "B00004XPPG", "B00001ZWUS", "B000H5TH20", "B000FKO5QK", "B002ZG99N6", "6304711905", "B0018CMJSU", "0767817710", "B009AMANBA", "079284646X", "B000FS9FCG", "B000065U1N", "B00AEBB89W", "B000P0J0AG", "B004SIP6QI", "B001QTXM5Y", "B004499LWG", "0783227906", "B00AEFY0F2", "B000J4P9P8", "B001GZ6QC4", "B00AEFY5B6", "B00AEBB95K", "B000NOKFHQ", "B002VWNICC", "B00009W5CA", "B004U7MR14", "B004AOECXI", "B00003CXRM", "0783231202", "B000069HZP", "0783229526", "B001JIE7JC", "B00005221M", "B000N6TX1I", "B00005JMJG", "B000N3SRO0", "B00003CXWV", "B00005JMYI", "B003HKN52U", "0790732238", "B00004U103", "B003UESJHO", "B000P0J09C"], "bought_together": ["B000M341QE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002ZG980U", "B000P0J09M", "B0013FXWU6", "B00H9KKGTO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 46244}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.89, "brand": "Miramax", "asin": "B00005JKN9", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516W0haa4aL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Gangs of New York (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)"}
{"description": "WithThe Return of the King, the greatest fantasy epic in film history draws to a grand and glorious conclusion. Director Peter Jackson's awe-inspiring adaptation of the Tolkien classicThe Lord of the Ringscould never fully satisfy those who remain exclusively loyal to Tolkien's expansive literature, but as a showcase for physical and technical craftsmanship it is unsurpassed in pure scale and ambition, setting milestone after cinematic milestone as the brave yet charmingly innocent Hobbit Frodo (Elijah Wood) continues his mission to Mordor, where he is destined to destroy the soul-corrupting One Ring of Power in the molten lava of Mount Doom. While the heir to the kingdom of Men, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), endures the massive battle at Minas Tirith with the allegiance of the elf Legolas (Orlando Bloom), dwarf Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) and the great wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen), Frodo and stalwart companion Samwise Gamgee (Sean Astin) must survive the schizoid deceptions of Gollum, who remains utterly convincing as a hybrid of performance (by Andy Serkis) and subtly nuanced computer animation.Jackson and cowriters Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens have much ground to cover; that they do so with intense pacing and epic sweep is impressive enough, but by investing greater depth and consequence in the actions of fellow Hobbits Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd), they ensure thatReturn of the Kingmaintains the trilogy's emphasis on intimate fellowship. While several major characters appear only briefly, and one (Christopher Lee's evil wizard, Saruman) relegated entirely to the extended version on DVD, Jackson is to be commended for his editorial acumen; like Legolas the archer, his aim as a filmmaker is consistently true, and he remains faithful to Tolkien's overall vision. IfReturnsuffers from too many endings, as some critic suggested, it's only because the epic's conclusion is so loyally inclusive of the actors--most notably Astin--who gave it such strength to begin with. By ending theLOTRtrilogy with noble integrity and faith in the power of imaginative storytelling,The Return of the King, like its predecessors, will stand as an adventure for the ages.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JKZV", "B00003CWT6", "B00BEZTMFY", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B002ZG980U", "B002PMV9FG", "B008UZA8FY", "B001NGML48", "B00005JM5E", "B001GZ6QC4", "B005COPWZW", "B008M4C1EO", "B00HFFE8HE", "039548930X", "B000W7F5SS", "B000I0RQVI", "B002VWNIDG", "B000E6EK2Y", "B001BYMX4A", "B004M1A21K", "B007K3JFUQ", "B001DHXT20", "B001UV4XHY", "0345325818", "B003Y5H54W", "B00005JNJV", "B00E5I2M6I", "B000A3XY5A", "B004LWZWGA", "B000U7WV1Y", "B005LXQLRW", "B001OQCV6A", "B000E8M0VA", "B004SIP8ZM", "B000EHRVMY", "0618640150", "B003ZK99NQ", "B0013FDM7E", "B00005JPH2", "B000UNYK4E", "B009JBWOU0", "B00003CX5P", "B00008G8M5", "B00GKOJ98E", "B004LWZW42", "B000H30B2C", "B000P0J0C4", "B00CZDLGDU", "B000M341QE", "B00008G8M4", "B000FKO5QK", "B00HWWUQYY", "B007SPPANM", "B008JFUO72", "B001DJLD1M", "0345538374", "B00AEFY5B6", "B00005JKCH", "B004SIP9U6", "B000YGGNMO", "B00E5I2M9K", "0618126988", "B005OCFGTO", "B00E8S2JZ4", "6305313687", "B004AKCME8", "B0002KVUKM", "B000AARKOO", "B0006GAO5Y", "B000K7VHQ4", "B002ZG997C", "B00AHTYI5M", "B008JFUS0U", "B0042MEQVG", "B00275EGWY", "B00E9PMML2", "B008UZDXEW", "B004SIP7F8", "B00116GEJS", "B00003CXI1", "B003ZKBELG", "B003Y5H5EW", "B000V4UFZK", "B0007PLLBU", "B001DTPZNY", "B002O3Z50Q", "B001GCUO1Q", "B000LP6KNU", "B005G4TJUC", "B00AW0KHTM", "B002ZG97YM", "054792819X", "B00AEFXZJE", "B0000YEEGM", "B002IPFWTE", "B001ECQ75A", "B000065U1N", "B0051MKNV8", "B000W796OM", "B00J49R1BY"], "bought_together": ["B00005JKZV", "B00003CWT6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00HFFE8HE", "B00003CWT6", "B00005JKZV", "B00BEZTMFY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 1589}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.49, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00005JKZY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HS7iSFv5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)"}

{"description": "A Beautiful Mindmanages to twist enough pathos out of John Nash's incredible life story to redeem an at-times goofy portrayal of schizophrenia. Russell Crowe tackles the role with characteristic fervor, playing the Nobel prize-winning mathematician from his days at Princeton, where he developed a groundbreaking economic theory, to his meteoric rise to the cover ofForbesmagazine and an MIT professorship, and on through to his eventual dismissal due to schizophrenic delusions. Of course, it is the delusions that fascinate director Ron Howard and, predictably, go astray. Nash's other world, populated as it is by a maniacal Department of Defense agent (Ed Harris), an imagined college roommate who seems straight out ofDead Poets Society, and an orphaned girl, is so fluid and scriptlike as to make the viewer wonder if schizophrenia is really as slick as depicted. Crowe's physical intensity drags us along as he works admirably to carry the film on his considerable shoulders. No doubt the story of Nash's amazing will to recover his life without the aid of medication is a worthy one, his eventual triumph heartening.

{"description": "The venerable Superman mythos gets a 21st-century updating in this imaginative and engaging television series from the WB Network, and series fans can celebrate the ratings success ofSmallvillewith a six-disc set that compiles its entire first season. The deluxe package offers a chance to revisit the origins of the characters and their numerous plotlines, as well as view deleted scenes and other bonus features.The premise ofSmallville--Superman as a teenager--takes up just a few pages in Superman's very first comic book appearance (inAction Comicsback in 1938), but series producers Alfred Gough and Miles Millar flesh out that period by portraying young Clark Kent (Tom Welling) not as the noble Superman-in-waiting, but as an average teen with some not-so-ordinary supernatural powers, including incredible strength and heat vision (Clark hasn't lifted up, up, and away as of yet). Clark's desire to fit in with his peers and make sense of his extraordinary abilities ground him in very realistic and identifiable terms for the series' primarily under-25 audience, as does his appealing and tentative romance with Kristen Kreuk as Clark's dreamgirl Lana Lang. ButSmallvillealso strikes gold when it takes a turn towards more comic book territory, as evidenced by the parade of shape-shifting killers and other outlandish antagonists (many generated, in one of the series' most ingenious notions, by the same devastating meteor shower that brought the infant Clark to Earth) that Clark must harness his powers to face and defeat. Gough and Millar, along with their capable cast (which includes Michael Rosenbaum as a young and already bald-pated Lex Luthor, and Annette O'Toole and John Schneider as the Kents) manage to pull off the precarious high-wire act of combining science fiction with coming-of-age drama to create this highly watchable program.Smallville: The Complete First Seasonoffers a very complete and attractive DVD package that is rounded out by some highly desirable extras for longtime series fans. The six-disc set offers all 21 episodes of the first season, including the pilot, in widescreen anamorphic format; Gough and Millar are featured on the set's sole commentary track, which appears on the pilot episode. Viewers can also access a number of deleted scenes from various episodes as well as view original pre-production storyboards and WB promotional spots. An interactive \"tour\" of Smallville rounds out the extras, but DVD-ROM owners can use the discs to access more features via theSmallvilleweb site.--Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0001JXPPC", "B0002Y0QV2", "B0009A5MUO", "B000G1R4SO", "B000N6SE4U", "B000X5SMXY", "B001FB4VZS", "B002JVWRDQ", "B003L77GG0", "B002JVWRE0", "B0012U7IWU", "B000R206FK", "B003L77GGA", "B001FB4W02", "B00080ZG2O", "B000BT96EG", "B004XWLN20", "B00BBXSPES", "B00BBXSPCK", "B000EHSVLE", "1419826670", "B000EHSVLY", "B000FP2OPY", "B00BGI086Q", "B000R204DY", "B000EU1Q2M", "B001ILFUB4", "B0072BNKHA", "B002JVWRAO", "B000NOKFGW", "B000R7GKQE", "B000FDDYPA", "B000EHSVM8", "B00F4FFO8E", "B000JLTRIG", "B000CCBCGM", "B009LDCXNY", "B000X5SPBI", "B001MVWRNE", "1401238246", "B00CN009Y2", "B00260HH30", "B00DYEN6XC", "B000P6XQ50", "B00DX88IL4", "B0013K2ZFY", "B0006IUE16", "B008JFUPFI", "B000EHSVL4", "B000HT3P60", "B009LDCWWG", "B0015RRNMA", "B00077BPA0", "B000HT3P7E", "B000SMNL92", "B000PFSYO4", "B002LWJ510", "B000P6YNTI", "B001FB4W0C", "B00079FUI6", "B003FSTN5M", "B005SH63HO", "B00AKK6MD4", "1563891182", "B00005JLIC", "B00G7QPX6C", "B009OAWMK8", "B002JVWR4A", "B0053O8AKU", "B005YU8WO2", "B00634MLIQ", "B004EPZ07K", "B000CCBC9O", "B001992NWO", "B000BT96FA", "B0087ZG7NO", "B008JFUS0U", "B000GG4Y6O", "B000PMFRTC", "B0018CWEUI", "1401246370", "B00005JNJV", "B000HEZEY6", "B004YPED14", "B00AZMFJYA", "B000RO6JYK", "B000BOH986", "B000F8O2P6", "B004FM2EQC", "B000HCO83Q", "B002BFBB0A", "B001L1S1OY", "B0000AGQ2H", "B000I0QLQY", "B00005JM3A", "B0006Z2KZ2", "B008X6N8KW", "B00915G6TE", "B00EIL7E9C", "B001G0MFIS"], "bought_together": ["B0001JXPPC", "B0002Y0QV2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B006CR2ON6", "B004XWLN20", "B0001JXPPC", "B000G1R4SO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 7871}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 19.75, "brand": "Warner Brothers", "asin": "B00005JLKB", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51hmhycPIYL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Smallville: Season 1"}

{"description": "James Bond DVDs have in general been pretty loaded, butDie Another Dayraises the bar with a two-disc set featuring dynamic DTS 6.1 ES and Dolby Digital 5.1 EX sound that makes good use of the rear speakers. The first commentary track is by Pierce Brosnan and Rosamund Pike (who plays villain Miranda Frost). They weren't together at the time, so their comments are spliced into one track. Brosnan has a good time watching and is proud of the film but also doesn't take himself too seriously (\"They don't teach you this stuff at drama school: 'OK, now you're going to be electrocuted by the bad guy.'\"). Self-proclaimed \"Bond novice\" Pike also is proud of the film and says she's annoyed by people who question whether there's still a need for Bond. On the second commentary track, director Lee Tamahori and producer Michael G. Wilson chat about topics as diverse as casting, Bond lore, and product placements. For more Bond lore, don't overlook the trivia track, which offers pop-up tidbits about the filming and tips on the inside jokes.The centerpiece of the second disc is the 80-minute \"InsideDie Another Day\" documentary, which is a set of featurettes strung together. Topics include the opening surfing sequence; the scenes set in North Korea and Cuba (including Halle Berry's bikini tribute to Ursula Andress); the ice palace; post-production elements such as computer graphics, editing, and music; the car battle (finding strong ice was the key safety issue); and the passing of the \"Q\" torch from Desmond Llewellyn to John Cleese.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000NIBURQ", "B000M53GM2", "B000RPCK1U", "B000NDEXPM", "B000M53GMW", "B000RPCK1K", "B000RPCK24", "B000NIBURG", "B000M53GLS", "B000RPCK1A", "B000NIBUR6", "B000M53GN6", "B001PPLIEG", "B001R10BN2", "B00AQSN7HE", "B000RPCK0Q", "B000M53GNG", "B000NIBUS0", "B000NDEXPC", "B00004RG62", "B000M53GMC", "B007REV4T8", "B00004WEJZ", "B00005JL0I", "B009PN18R2", "B008YAPQX4", "B004BR7XLM", "B009PN3OD8", "B003QO8TOQ", "B000HRMAPE", "B000VNMMR0", "B0000BYRO7", "B00AZFECL8", "B000EGDB10", "B004EPYZUS", "B0004Z33EQ", "B00AIBZMD6", "B009A87Z6U", "B009RO9LKK", "B000SK5Z70", "B00003CXMV", "6305657947", "B00005JLYW", "B00005JN2Z", "B00023B1LC", "B005PTYP70", "B00008G8M4", "B00005JNJV", "B00000G3PA", "B000P0J06K", "B002UZCJ8Y", "B002ZG9864", "0792844068", "B00005JKIP", "0792166736", "0790732238", "B00AS1Q93S", "B003Q6D2B4", "B0002I84N0", "B000U1ZV8K", "B008JFURII", "B00JA3RVG4", "B000MZHW40", "B00026ZG10", "0790732149", "B000FKO3HG", "B000AP04FG", "B008JFUS0U", "B0001FGC1U", "B00005JMQW", "B009L6UDUG", "B00AVWIQZS", "B0013BM63O", "B00005JLRT", "B00E5I2M6I", "B001TK80C0", "B00AZMFJYA", "B0007KZQAM", "B002ZG999U", "B00BUAEYVK", "B009A87ZQU", "B000P0J06U", "B008JFUO72", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B00003CY0V", "B00E5I2MCM", "B0036TGSR6", "B003AWRMBU", "B0000BYRO9", "B008JFUNHI", "B00177YA1K", "6304696221", "B0021L8V0M", "B00006G8FD", "B000UR9T8C", "B002GNOSFM", "B003UESJFQ", "B0006L0LOS", "B000AYELVU"], "bought_together": ["B000NIBURQ", "B000M53GM2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000M53GM2", "B000RPCK1U", "B000M53GN6", "B000RPCK0Q"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 38500}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.0, "brand": "MGM", "asin": "B00005JLBE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51kgPWMuVFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Die Another Day (Widescreen Special Edition)"}

{"description": "Like any DVD blockbuster from producer Jerry Bruckheimer, the extras are plentiful and often a bit too self-congratulatory (worst offender here is the primary commentary track). The slickly (natch) produced making-of documentary goes through the standard routine; however, the less-flashy \"fly on the wall\" bits--just showing what happens on set without comment--is more fun, offering effortless insight on the filmmaking process. The best treasure is a nifty interactive history on pirates with plenty of background material. You can simply play the filmed segments or take a tour around a ship to discover the material (and a few surprises). There's a lot of archival material on the theme-park ride that inspired the film and several odds and ends including an enjoyable chronicle of the vintage ship's voyage from its home harbor to the movie set. The kids should really dig the DVD-ROM \"Moonlight Becomes Ye,\" in which they can turn their own mug into a ghostly pirate. There's also a bounty of extended and deleted scenes (19 in all) and a very funny blooper reel. With both DTS and Dolby 5.1, sound systems will get a workout with the excellent (and loud) sound design.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000I0RQVI", "B000U7WV1Y", "B005COPWZW", "B004A8ZWUQ", "B00005JN5E", "B0013BM63O", "B006VRRGNK", "B00005JKZV", "B00005JPH2", "B0014Z4OMU", "B00E5I2MCM", "B00003CWT6", "B004DTLK80", "B00005JKZY", "B0000A1RJI", "B004M1A21K", "B004DTLK7G", "B00003CXZ1", "B001HN694K", "B001E75QH0", "B00E5I2M6I", "B00005JKCH", "B0087ZG7HK", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B000E6EK2Y", "B000E8M0VA", "B003UYUQZW", "B00AEFYGBA", "B000W746GK", "B00005JMQW", "B0083SBMBM", "B001DHXT20", "B0002234LS", "B000W7F5SS", "B002PMV9FG", "B0002KVUKM", "B004EPYZUS", "B0053FANRC", "B00BEZTMFY", "6304806434", "B000VR0570", "0783231644", "B001OQCV6A", "B000AYELVA", "B008JFUO72", "B005G4TJUC", "B00004R99S", "B00023B1LC", "B00E5I2M9K", "B00003CXI1", "B001HQZJMU", "B00000IRE6", "B0002ZDVEU", "B008QE9XD2", "B00F84H73Q", "B00E5I2MEK", "B003Y5H5EW", "B007K3JFUQ", "B003QO8TOQ", "B000NQRR1Q", "B000YPUF9W", "B001EZE5BU", "B004A8ZWSS", "B0009MDPYM", "B00LG6YEKE", "B002ZG980U", "B002ZG994U", "B000U1ZV8K", "B001DZ8TRW", "B00005JLR2", "B000VWYJ86", "B00AZMFJYA", "B001GZ6QC4", "B00000JQB5", "B004XKCZAG", "B000W796OM", "B001GCUO0W", "B00AQSN7HE", "B00000ILDH", "B0053FANT0", "B0000VAFO0", "B0002IQMAM", "B000HRMAPE", "B004LWZW7Y", "B008UZA8FY", "B0001HLVS2", "B00007AJGH", "B00005JNJV", "B003YAR97K", "B00CHVJODE", "B000UR9T8C", "B0049IHX2C", "B000G6BLW4", "B00177YA1K", "0783227345", "B0014Z4ON4", "B001TK80C0", "B002O5M4T4", "B00AEBBA72", "B00005JOC9"], "bought_together": ["B000I0RQVI", "B000U7WV1Y"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005COPWZW", "B000I0RQVI", "B0071JADFU", "B00005JPFX"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 6260}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.23, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B00005JM5E", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51fX40gGdXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)"}
{"description": "There's something in this house...Something ancient and dark that remains still, hidden and silent. It can only wait, having been concealed in the shadows for years. In fact, its milieu is darkness. Only in it can it show itself and move. It even takes its name: DARKNESS. It's lived here since someone tried to call it, more than forty years ago. Because this house hides a secret, a terrible past, an inconceivably evil act. Seven children, faceless people, a circle that must be completed. And blood, lots of blood... But something went wrong. One of the children got away. The circle wasn't completed. That's why what lives here isn't finished. It's just waiting...It tries to carry out what it couldn't before, making plans in the shadows, to become complete, to be, to exist. A new family has just moved into the house. A small child. An unstable father capable of losing his temper at any time. A perfect target. The right place at the right time. The pieces only have to be put in place. And then wait. Maybe the family's daughter will be able to discover the truth; the dark secret of the past, the sinister conspiracy, the truth about what threatens them. Why is the father getting worse? What is her little brother afraid of? Why doesn't her mother listen to her? And why do the lights keep going out? It could be that nothing happens by chance, that everything has been worked out from the start. A devilish plan, precise and exact like a time-bomb. Her father's illness, the house, the circles, the children. Perhaps she can foresee darkness' master stroke of play and the inevitable destiny that is closing in on her family. But maybe it's too late....", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0013FZUP6", "B00EZ50SGW", "0783237413", "B00015HX5O", "B00008LUNW", "B00BEIYG98", "B004P7CN3G", "B001U0HBQA", "B000ECXWW2", "B00AJLHUA8", "B00BEIYMAG", "B00000K31T", "B00IKM5LXG", "B000OVLBGM", "B0021L8UFI", "B00005JOWW", "B004SUDQ4A", "B006QWC2ZC", "B00B96TGQS", "B00441GYTC", "B00003CWRF", "B0002H3S78", "B0006SGYL0", "B000TXNDT8", "B000HC2LFI", "B0010X740A", "B001NFNFNU", "B00DPUB5EW", "B008VPCL7G", "B0031U8OEK", "B00005UM2X", "B00AEFYCW8", "B002ZG98LO", "B002GHHHL0", "B003VA3JUO", "B00AIBZLVY", "B00AEFYSR2", "B000AWYOGE", "B004SUDQ04", "6305428271", "B000NQRR1Q", "B0097C046W", "B00005JMET", "B001KKU9CI", "B000PMLJMQ", "B004LWZW24", "B007CZ3E7C", "B003LR5BDK", "B003AWRMC4", "B003Y5H54W", "1573625779", "B003IWYWC4", "B000RGN2JI", "B000OCY7TY", "B001UV4X8S", "B0006SSOHC", "B002ZG971U", "B009XTF8KQ", "B00003CXWM", "B0067QPVJ6", "B005TK23PQ", "B0009X763M", "B000FFJZO2", "B004EPYZT4", "B0000AUHOK", "B003Y5H4SO", "B0002C4JJ4", "B000069I1I", "B00005UQ9W", "B000GCFO0I", "B005LAIGOQ", "B002LMSWN2", "B005LAIIRQ", "B004SIP95G", "B001QOGYAO", "B008JFUNYG", "B00003CWOL", "B00005JL3T", "B000ASATZ8", "B000ION22G", "6305908087", "B000ARTMT8"], "bought_together": ["B0013FZUP6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B008D1RCZY", "B004P7CN7W", "B007AFC236", "B000AA4JL6"]}, "price": 15.47, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 95491}, "asin": "B00005JNBN", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41C8GH93EFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Darkness (Unrated Version)"}

{"description": "The seemingly obligatory director's commentary is not on this two-disc set of Michael Mann's slick thriller yet the extras are so good you won't miss it. On the surface, there's nothing out of the ordinary here with the exception of a few minutes of rehearsal footage, but everything is just so darn interesting to watch. Mann and his stars dish about the making of the film, including the creation of Cruise's assassin. The nighttime shooting (shot digitally and transferred sublimely) is examined along with a single deleted scene (with a clear explanation on why it was cut). Think the climatic finale aboard a train was shot on a subway for convenience? No, Mann just wanted to control the backgrounds!

{"description": "Despite super effects, a huge budget, and the cinematic pedigree of alien-happy Steven Spielberg, this take on H.G. Wells's novel is basically a horror film packaged as a sci-fi thrill ride. Instead of a mad slasher, however, Spielberg (along with writers Josh Friedman & David Koepp) utilizes aliens hell-bent on quickly destroying humanity, and the terrifying results that prey upon adult fears, especially in the post-9/11 world. The realistic results could be a new genre, the grim popcorn thriller; often you feel like you're watching Schindler's List more than Spielberg's other thrill-machine movies (Jaws,Jurassic Park). The film centers on Ray Ferrier, a divorced father (Tom Cruise, oh so comfortable) who witnesses one giant craft destroy his New Jersey town and soon is on the road with his teen son (Justin Chatwin) and preteen daughter (Dakota Fanning) in tow, trying to keep ahead of the invasion. The film is, of course, impeccably designed and produced by Spielberg's usual crew of A-class talent. The aliens are genuinely scary, even when the film--like the novel--spends a good chunk of time in a basement. Readers of the book (or viewers of the deft 1953 adaptation) will note the variation of whom and how the aliens come to Earth, which poses some logistical problems. The film opens and closes with narration from the novel read by Morgan Freeman, but Spielberg could have adapted Orson Welles's words from the famous Halloween Eve 1938 radio broadcast: \"We couldn't soap all your windows and steal all your garden gates by tomorrow night, so we did the best next thing: we annihilated the world.\"--Doug ThomasWar of the Worldsat Amazon.comThe SoundtrackThe War of the Worlds(1953)War of the Worlds - The Complete First Season(TV series)Classic Sci-Fi Movies and Their RemakesAliens Invade on DVDThe Prog-rock Opera (no kidding)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEBB8VK", "B00005JL78", "B001SGEUYW", "B00008G8M4", "B00005JL3T", "B0013FDM7E", "B00AEFXNLY", "B00005JMXX", "B001OQCV2E", "B000VECAD0", "B002O3Z510", "B0002V7OI8", "B000H30B2C", "B000EGDB10", "B00005JN2Z", "B005LAIIMG", "B005PTYP70", "B002O3Z50G", "B0002V7ON8", "B00005JN0T", "B00K2CHW48", "B002SJIO4A", "0783225547", "B008JFUO36", "B00005JKLZ", "B00AS1Q93S", "1936594056", "B004EPYZUS", "B001TUZG4K", "B00AEFXR1K", "B00001ZWUS", "B00AEFXYJA", "0767817478", "B0034G4ORC", "B003QO8TOQ", "B00070FX5U", "B0045HCJSA", "B00000G3PA", "B005LAIHPE", "B003Y5H5GK", "B00AEBBA72", "B00003CWU3", "B00I9TDMRM", "B001ECDVKE", "B00003CXXP", "B000V4UFZK", "B0010X73ZG", "B001DZOC6Y", "B00005JKFR", "B000XT1P4S", "B003HKN52U", "B0009PW4D2", "B000HRMAPE", "B004EPYZPS", "B0018QPPXW", "B0002WZTOI", "B00AEBB9LO", "B004LWZW4M", "B003ABZHAO", "B003YJFALS", "B0087ZG7HK", "B000OT6V64", "B004P7CN7W", "B000CCBC9O", "B00000ILDD", "0767803434", "B001L57ZYM", "B000065V3G", "B007STBUHI", "B002ZG980U", "B008JFUQZ2", "B00005B6JZ", "B0006GANOQ", "B000F1IQN2", "1494343576", "B001GCUO02", "B00004Y87O", "0783226810", "B004EPYZSK", "B000P0J0BU", "B005LAIHXQ", "B001680M26", "B000EQHXN2", "B0045HCJFS", "B00004BZIY", "B00008G8M5", "B00003CXQA", "B008JFUS0U", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00EIN6KJ0", "B0000DZ6N3", "B000MV8A9A", "B00005JKYX", "B0000YEEGM", "B000TGJ8CQ", "B0013FCWUW", "B002ZG9864", "B00003CWTI", "B008MIMWQW", "B00IKM5OCO"], "bought_together": ["B00AEBB8VK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AEBB8VK", "B004LWZW4M", "B00005JL78", "B004EPYZSK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 18739}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.95, "brand": "Dreamworks Skg", "asin": "B00005JNTI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51upxzPRnXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "War of the Worlds"}

Roseanne spoke up for a kind of lower-class feminism; she didn't concern herself much with politics, but within the family she just as much in charge as her husband Dan (the ever-dependable John Goodman,Barton Fink,The Big Lebowski)--though in the final episode of the first season, she took a stand at her factory job that was halfNorma Rae, halfCool Hand Luke. But most often the show turned the ordinary rituals of domestic life (putting the kids to bed, coping with visiting parents) into sharp comic scenarios. The stories were smartly hidden in a series of scenes that felt organic and unforced. The entire cast--one of the best ensembles ever, including theater veteran Laurie Metcalf (Scream 2) as Roseanne's sister Jackie; Lecy Goranson as eldest daughter Becky; Michael Fishman as youngest child D.J.; and especially Sara Gilbert (Poison Ivy,ER) as middle daughter Darlene--swiftly cultivated the mixture of comfort and tension that marks most family relationships. The result was a portrait of American family life that rang achingly, hilariously true.Roseanne's first season was solid from the start; few shows have had such an immediate grasp of their ideal tone and rhythm. Roseanne may have been a little stiff in the first few episodes, but she developed her chops quickly. By only the third episode, in which Roseanne and Dan run into a divorced friend at a restaurant and do some impromptu evaluating of their own married life, Roseanne was already exploring the psychology behind the wisecracks. By episode 6, set in a bowling alley, Roseanne begins to truly inhabit her character, growing more physically and emotionally expansive (she herself singles out this episode as the one where she started to have fun). Roseanne was never afraid to share the spotlight; Goodman, Metcalf, and the kids all had central roles in one episode or another, and one of the most striking episodes focused on Roseanne's coworker Crystal (the underrated Natalie West), whose husband had been embedded in concrete while working on a bridge. This black comic premise gave way to surprisingly touching grief when old secrets emerged.  Guest performers like George Clooney (a semi-regular in the first season), Ned Beatty (as Dan's father), Estelle Parsons (an insidious turn as Roseanne's mother), and Fred Thompson (as a domineering supervisor) always had meaty material to work with. Simply one of the best sitcoms of all time. Caveat: the set uses the episodes as they were shortened for syndication, not the originally broadcast versions that were 2-3 minutes longer.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0058JEI06", "B007C8RZJW", "B007C8RZYC", "B008L0YMUK", "B008L0YN6I", "B00B04NJ12", "B00B04NIOU", "B00BUWD7SO", "B005BIGAL4", "B005ENCIXU", "B008XJM8ZU", "B00BUWD7E8", "B0002W4SX6", "B00GOC75YW", "B00DJYK1XU", "B0007KTBJO", "B0058JEHTS", "B000AJJNJK", "B00D2UMHSI", "B0058JEHSO", "B000EYK4H6", "B000I2J6VE", "B0000AKY3Q", "B000AJJNIQ", "B000EBGFQI", "B00GLT2SOA", "B00000F5W8", "B0007ZSHR6", "B0002W4SWW", "B0009YCLBS", "B000H7JCG4", "B000C1VBAA", "B00BXPMJL4", "B0058EE6OO", "B00I099K4U", "B0058EE6NK", "B00008WJEZ", "B000291Q3O", "B000KGGIL4", "B00D2UMHB0", "B000291Q3Y", "B000067DNE", "B0000C9JFQ", "B0000DFZ5O", "B000I2J6W8", "B004D2GMVM", "B0006J27WY", "B0009B16TO", "B0007US79Y", "B0007R4SWC", "B00I458456", "B002E58FT2", "B000MGBSHQ", "B002E58FTW", "B000SQFC0O", "B0007YXRCW", "B0000CGNEC", "B00079FUI6", "B004MWLXTY", "B00008NV4G", "B007KFZ7UQ", "B00BDZV8ZM", "B009LDD3I8", "B000K7UBXE", "B00005JLIB", "B000KP62FM", "B001G0MFOM", "B007KFZ85K", "B0036TGSR6", "B007C8RZQ0", "B000FBH3WM", "B00005JOHC", "B008L3650M", "B008KZX7W0", "B0000E32X2", "B0002NY81M", "B000E3L7FK", "B00005JKJS", "B007KFZ8B4", "B000M341S2", "B000FBH3WC", "B0002UE1WQ", "B00005JLEX", "B0012018OE", "B000HEZEYG", "B0007V6IWQ", "B00005JM3G", "B008L3653O", "B006WK4Y8Q", "B00007KK5I", "B0001ZMWXW", "B001DHXT5C", "B000FA57U8", "B005D0OHA6", "B007RMQ4HW", "B000H1RFXM", "B003TNW02G", "B0006Z2L4W", "B00HVTRDZ8"], "bought_together": ["B0058JEI06", "B007C8RZJW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00BUWD7E8", "B007C8RZJW", "B008L0YMUK", "B007C8RZYC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 153432}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 18.3, "brand": "", "asin": "B00005JNF7", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/511DAJ50NPL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Roseanne: Season 1"}
{"description": "Critics and controversy aside,The Da Vinci Codeis a verifiable blockbuster. Combine the film's huge worldwide box-office take with over 100 million copies of Dan Brown's book sold, andThe Da Vinci Codehas clearly made the leap from pop-culture hit to a certifiable franchise. The leap for any story making the move from book to big screen, however, is always more perilous. In the case ofThe Da Vinci Code, the plot is concocted of such a preposterous formula of elements that you wouldn&#x92;t envy screenwriter Akiva Goldsman, the man tasked with making this story filmable. The script followsDan Brown&#x92;s bookas closely as possible while incorporating a few needed changes, including a better ending. And if you&#x92;re like most of the world, by now you&#x92;ve read the book and know how it goes: while lecturing in Paris, noted Harvard Professor of Symbology Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) is summoned to the Louvre by French police to help decipher a bizarre series of clues left at the scene of the murder of the chief curator. Enter Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou), gifted cryptologist. Neveu and Langdon team up to solve the mystery, and from there the story is propelled across Europe, ballooning into a modern-day mini-quest for the Holy Grail, where secret societies are discovered, codes are broken, and murderous albino monks are thwarted&#x85; oh, and alternative theories about the life of Christ and the beginnings of Christianity are presented too, of course. It&#x92;s not the typical formula for a stock Hollywood thriller. In fact, taken solely as a mystery, the movie almost works--despite some gaping holes--mostly just because it keeps moving. Brown&#x92;s greatest trick was  to have the entire story take place in one day, so the action is forced to keep moving, despite some necessary pauses for exposition. As a screen couple, Hanks and Tautou are just fine together but not exactly memorable; meanwhile Sir Ian McKellen&#x92;s scenery-chewing as pivotal character Sir Leigh Teabing is just what the film needed to keep it from taking itself too seriously. The whole thing is like a good roller-coaster ride: try not to think too much about it--just sit back and enjoy the trip.--Daniel VanciniVisit The Da Vinci Code StoreOn The DVDThe DVD extras on a film as popular asThe Da Vinci Codeshould be plentiful, and this version doesn&#x92;t skimp. With over 90 minutes of special features, including ten behind-the-scenes featurettes, there&#x92;s a lot here to explore beyond the film itself. The question is, is there anything new here that we haven&#x92;t heard before, in all the hype, pseudo-documentaries, and controversy surrounding the movie, to make it worthwhile?  For most viewers, the answer will be \"yes.\" Essentially, if you like the movie, if you enjoyed the book, you will get a lot out of them.Just as the movie is intended to make the book come to life, the DVD extras should make the film come to life by pointing the audience into the world of the filmmakers, connecting the dots between print and film, and for the most part they do just that. The extras here range from the typical look behind-the-scenes to more in-depth features on the supporting characters, the locations, and theMona Lisaherself.  \"First Day on the Set with Ron Howard\" features the director gushing about the opportunity to film in the Louvre and work with Tom Hanks again (the two worked together before onSplashandApollo 13). It&#x92;s a short piece that doesn&#x92;t reveal much beyond making an attempt to share Howard&#x92;s excitement (with the \"Gee, I really loved working with him/her on this project\" that you hear in every such featurette), but viewers might enjoy seeing how the stage was set up in the famous museum, down to the spike tape on the floor showing actors where to hit their marks.The Filmmaking Experience, Parts 1 and 2further explores the creative and technical aspects of the filmmaking process.A Conversation with Dan Brownstarts out feeling like a puff-piece (the man who wrote this book got started at age 5 with a story calledThe Giraffe, The Pig, and the Pants on Fire. \"It was a thriller,\" he says.) and unfortunately it doesn&#x92;t go very deep into much of anything of interest. But on the other hand, this isn&#x92;t60 Minuteshere; it&#x92;s intended to give viewers a better sense of the man behind the franchise, which it does.  Much of the footage from this interview is sprinkled throughout some of the other featurettes. Meanwhile, the character behind the franchise, Robert Langdon, is examined in his own featurette, as is Sophie Neveu. The cool thing here is getting under the skin of the actors to see how they approached the characters, knowing that most of the movie-going public already has formed their own ideas about the characters from the book.The most interesting extras are the featurettes that focus on the history behind the mystery. Or is it the mystery behind the history?  Either way, the first one on theMona Lisa, and the second featurette on the many codes and symbols that are hidden throughout the movie balance out the remainder of the extras nicely by demonstrating the sense of intrigue, mystery, and game-playing adventure that madeThe Da Vinci Codeso popular in the first place.--Daniel VanciniBeyondThe Da Vinci CodeThe Films of Tom HanksThe Films of Ron HowardThe Da Vinci DVDs: Decoding \"The Da Vinci Code\"More About The ArtistStills fromThe Da Vinci Code(click for larger image)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002O5M4T4", "B00005JN5E", "B0013BM63O", "B002ZTQVKM", "B0007XG02W", "B001OLP2TI", "B002C68WNW", "0307474275", "B002O5M4SU", "B00005JLSB", "B000PHVZNE", "B0077ATSSQ", "B00AEFY0F2", "B000EPR7NE", "0743486226", "B001LMAK9W", "B000P0J0EW", "0385504209", "B005HWAOP2", "B001OQCV2E", "B0013XZ2QK", "B001EZE5D8", "B00005JL3T", "B000EOTW0Q", "6304711891", "B000YDBPAM", "0307950689", "B000HT386M", "B00008G8M4", "B000P0J0EM", "B002ZG99KO", "0800141806", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B00001ZWUS", "B0002V7OI8", "B002O3Z50Q", "B0006GANOQ", "B002NZK5UU", "B000NQRR1Q", "0385504225", "B004SIP7ZS", "B00005Y71F", "B000OYC7BW", "B00DL48BM6", "B00026ZG10", "B0018CWW5K", "B00004BZIY", "B0000B1OFL", "B00023B1LC", "B000N6U0E2", "B00A8MGIZG", "B00005JM5E", "B002LMV7R0", "B00004Z4WR", "B000K2UGXO", "B00005JMYC", "B001MVYUQG", "B00005JLWN", "B000056PMU", "B0000AOV4I", "B00AEFY4CG", "B00441GYXS", "B001F12J0C", "B00ES28X3C", "B002ZG980U", "B001VLBDD0", "B00008K76U", "B001TK80C0", "B008JFURII", "B000VWYJ86", "0792159659", "B00AEFYGBA", "B0009MDPYM", "B00177YA1K", "B00005N5S5", "B0043X1FM2", "B0002J58HO", "B00005JM5B", "B00AZMFJYA", "B003AWRMBA", "074349346X", "B003VA3JUO", "0783240295", "6305767866", "B0000844I8", "B000065U1N", "B002GHHHKQ", "B000K7VHQE", "B0000AXE8I", "0800177258", "B000ASDFGI", "B003Q6D2B4", "B000HRMAPE", "B000U7WV1Y", "B00005JMOW", "B00GPWEPZ8", "0312944926", "B000VI70QS", "B000KF0GWW"], "bought_together": ["B002O5M4T4", "B00005JN5E"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002O5M4T4", "B00I563DSC", "B0013BM63O", "1400079152"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 7555}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.5, "brand": "DaVinci", "asin": "B00005JOC9", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51SLBDLMtIL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Da Vinci Code (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition)"}

{"description": "From the writer of BRING IT ON comes STICK IT, the fun, irreverent comedy that turns the competitive world of gymnastics on its head. After walking out on her teammates at the gymnastics championships two years before, the talented but rebellious Haley Graham is forced to return to the rigid world of rules, catfights, and spandex. Her in-your-face attitude quickly collides with her hard-nosed coach and teammates.

{"description": "Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man: Bela Lugosi as Frankenstein's Monster and Lon Chaney, Jr. as the cursed Wolf Man collide in one of the great classic horror films of the 1940s. Beginning as a moody chiller, director Roy William Neill sets the stage for an unforgettable clash. The resurrected Wolf Man, seeking a cure for his malady, enlists the aid of mad scientists Patric Knowles, who claims he will not only rid the Wolf Man of his nocturnal metamorphosis but will also revive the frozen body of Frankenstein's inhuman creation.House of Frankenstein: Deranged scientists, Gustav Niemann (Boris Karloff), escapes from prison and overtakes the director of a traveling chamber of horrors. Pulling the stake out of a skeleton, he revives the infamous Count Dracula (John Carradine) and commands him to kill the man responsible for his imprisonment. He then finds the frozen Frankenstein Monster (Glenn Strange) and the Wolfman (Lon Chaney, Jr.) buried under the ruins of the infamous Frankenstein laboratory. When he brings them back to life, the Monster is uncontrollable and drags him to a watery grave.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005LC4L", "B00005LC4N", "B006TTC5J0", "B00001TZ6Q", "B00005LC4J", "B00005LC4M", "0783233582", "B00005LC4O", "078323502X", "B00000JQB7", "B000035Z3K", "B0000694WM", "B00000JMOF", "B000A1INIA", "B0016586Q8", "0783240961", "B00005NSXY", "B0001CNRLG", "B003M8NGG2", "B00000F62P", "B000WNHTCC", "B000U1ZV7G", "B0009X770E", "B0007R4T26", "B0009X770O", "B00009NHC0", "B00B94VJYW", "B000EHQTZO", "0783240953", "B002945DUW", "B00000ILEU", "B005AMJ3B0", "B005ETANC2", "B0001HAGTM", "B0001CNRLQ", "B000063UR0", "B00D9EJFV4", "B00009NHBC", "B00023P4O2", "B0002NRRRY", "B000FWHW8Q", "B0007R4SZY", "B0013XZ6SY", "B000A0GOFA", "B000FOPPEC", "B000AQKU72", "B00005R1O7", "B001B9ZVVC", "B00000K3U3", "B00AEBB8VK", "B00D9EJFZA", "B000FWHW90", "B0087ZG7RK", "B00006G8K0", "B00009PY38", "B009AGEY98", "B0002NRRQU", "B002TSAAS8", "B00005KHJP", "B002DY9KQG", "B0081AWUVI", "B0001CNRNE", "B000QGEB1W", "B000FVQLKW", "B0024FADD8", "B00006G8JZ", "B00009PY4D", "B008FL8OTK", "B001AR0D40", "B000RXVNDI", "0783242379", "B00005JKFR", "B00DOZNGC2", "B000EHSVJG", "B000GRUQJW", "B000A0GOFK", "B00IE41A9O", "B000HEVZ7G", "B000VX9WB4", "B00BUWD7Q6", "B005D0RDKM", "B000068TPF", "B00005AUK0", "B007Y1NNAW", "B001DB6J50", "B00L8QP13Q", "B000095J42", "B002CWKU18", "B000UAFDR0", "B000P24FAE", "B00HFWETZ8", "B003HTSJ9A", "B00L8QOZ6U", "B0000648YD", "630284178X", "B0034PWPHY", "B00009PY4A", "B00AEBB94G", "B0000AUHOK", "B001GCUO0W"], "bought_together": ["B00005LC4L", "B006TTC5J0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0783233582", "B006TTC5J0", "B00005LC4L", "B000A1INIA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 18416}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.21, "brand": "UNI DIST CORP.

{"description": "Kansas City in the 1930s was a wild, wide-open place. Under political  boss Tom Pendergast, the booze flowed freely, prostitution and gambling  flourished, and the Depression pretty much passed the city by, making it an  ideal spawning ground for some great music. Pianist-bandleader Count Basie,  saxophone immortals Lester Young and Charlie Parker, and blues belters Big Joe  Turner and Jimmy Rushing were all working there, along with a host of lesser- known but equally formidable musicians, and they all played the blues, Kansas  City style.Director Bruce Ricker's 90-minuteThe Last of the Blue Devilschronicles  the 1979 reunion of many of these legendary players, combining interviews,  vintage film footage, photos, and some inimitably swinging performances by  Basie, Turner, pianist Jay McShann, and many others to create an intimate, good- natured portrait of what one old-timer calls the \"cool, relaxed sound\" of the  city. The camaraderie among these men, all of whom are colorful raconteurs  (drummer Ernie Williams's harangues to some bemused local kids are especially  entertaining), is palpable. But it's the music, unsurprisingly, that's the main  attraction; performances include some familiar tunes, like Turner's \"Shake,  Rattle & Roll\" and a Basie big band version of \"Night Train\" (featuring tenor  saxophonist Jimmy Forrest, the tune's composer) that's as greasy as the local  barbecue.The Last of the Blue Devilsis an absolute delight.--Sam  Graham", "related": {"also_bought": ["B003ASLJJK", "B0016OM3TU", "B000BVNS7U", "B0006Q9482", "0062005596", "B00H3JHH6Q", "0195307127", "B00EDR5MTK", "B00000470T", "B00007CVRL", "B002NO4IHC", "B00020X9CO", "B000UB054U", "B004D0AMOM", "B0012K53U4", "B001W3P50O", "B000BITUEI", "B00028G7CU", "B001HZ4K8U", "0394548647", "0816673012", "B005MQJP9E", "0671400037"], "bought_together": ["B003ASLJJK", "B0016OM3TU"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0006Q9482", "B000002ACU"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 222151}, "categories": [["CDs & Vinyl", "Jazz"], ["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 21.65, "brand": "KINO VIDEO", "asin": "B00005M2CK", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ANMP6Z6PL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Last of the Blue Devils - The Kansas City Jazz Story"}
{"description": "61*is an endearing ode to the baseball days of yore when the press was the enemy, salaries were in check, and breaking records with bat and glove took on Ruthian proportions. In 1961 baseball expanded its season from 154 games to 162, allowing weaker pitching into the major leagues and two New York Yankees teammates--the colorless Roger Maris and golden boy Mickey Mantle--to make an assault on the sport's ultimate record: Babe Ruth's 60 home runs. To add to the stew, baseball commissioner Ford Frick announced any record set in the last eight games of the season wouldn't count toward the official record; records had to be achieved in 154 games.Director Billy Crystal guarantees success for his movie in the perfect casting of the leads. Barry Pepper (Saving Private Ryan's religious sniper) is deft as Maris, and Thomas Jane is a perfect Mantle, a superman in a Yankee uniform. Despite the differences between family man Maris and hard-living Mantle, they form a rewarding friendship amid the media and fan frenzy. The shy Maris took the brunt of the storm, even facing boo-birds in his home stadium. Crystal and first-time writer Hank Steinberg keep the pace moving quickly between the field, the locker room, the press box, and the home front. The film never tries to dazzle with more than the facts (and it softens Mantle up a bit), yet it belongs on the short list of grand baseball movies.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0010YSD90", "B009NNM9OA", "B00009AOAX", "B000MNOX94", "B0012YYZDG", "078324021X", "B00DW5IKW0", "B0060ZJ7BC", "B000068NNU", "B00AATUZLU", "B0068FZ0GK", "B0010YSD8Q", "B004X2TYG2", "B005SQRYEG", "B009POCG2C", "0800177258", "B00E1HIWTO", "B00F3LSXPA", "B00AEFYKWU", "B003VE9WTW", "B001BSBBF8", "B000FOPPDI", "B000R7HY46", "B000FTCLRG", "B0007LLPXI", "B00AEFXHNI", "B00DNF1SSC", "B00028HBES", "B000MNOX80", "B00720ONHM", "B00009AOAW", "B000069I1K", "B0000633U2", "B0006GAI5U", "B000053V7F", "B000J3OTT6", "B008KNC46W", "0792843592", "B007FQXEXW", "B000063JDN", "B0006Q941Y", "B000A0GXRO", "B00004W221", "B00IB3SDRK", "B000EXZFCQ", "B001KRCDT8", "B002E01LOI", "B00284EMI2", "B006TTC5B8", "B0001US66Y", "B002DQL34Q", "B00158K0QU", "B004J713LK", "B00005NTOI", "B00005NGAZ", "B00005JKE4", "B004GJYRF0", "B009NNM9TU", "6305428492", "B00005JPBO", "B00AMSQBP8", "B002VECM6S", "B000FVR1T2", "B000ND91WC", "B003S1UNZU", "B000CNFC76", "B00478ED1S", "B001BL96JI", "B005HQ5SDQ", "B002AT8KD8", "B00007LP8J", "B00005RIIY", "1451676719", "B000X5RBXG", "B002O3Z4XY", "B000HREKP2", "B000MNOX9E", "B00076YP0I", "B000WPE8Q0", "B00EE41SAY", "B0013XZ760", "B00DQCSWUE", "B00004TJQJ", "0743268938", "B0036APHRC", "B00CLSBNNM", "0060883537", "B008H6GHHY", "0783117531", "B00003CWUX", "B00AEFXOKO", "B004QRUN8M", "B00AEFXJY0", "B000G8P1Y6", "6304584210", "B0095YMNGG", "B0007LLPWO", "B008LW25CK", "B000R7HY4G"], "bought_together": ["B009NNM9OA", "B0068FZ0GK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B009NNM9OA", "B0068FZ0GK", "B004X2TYG2", "B0060ZJ7BC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 2990}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 8.26, "brand": "Team Marketing", "asin": "B00005M20J", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51x7vQtkO-L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "61*"}

Unfortunately for Tommy, (and very unfortunately for his friend), instead of finding a rotting corpse, they discover a well rested Jason who comes back from the dead for another bloody rampage in Friday The 13th - Part VI: Jason Lives.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEFY31S", "B00AEFY2LO", "B00AEFY37C", "B00AEFY2E6", "B00006FDBT", "B00AQJ8MLY", "B00006FI0R", "B00AEFY2AA", "B001JFZ1UE", "B00AEFY1V0", "B001NPD9LS", "B000FA57UI", "B0000VCZMK", "B000FA57US", "B001L9EXNO", "B00005LC4Q", "B005CFC0N8", "B001DJLD0S", "B0000AOX09", "B000Q66Q2O", "B004P7CM9Q", "B000RIWAVW", "B001DJLD1W", "B000FS9FE4", "B00006LPHA", "B000I2J68M", "B00AEFY22I", "B004P7CNUY", "0780630866", "B00JWXDD6O", "0780630890", "B000099T3M", "B0033B5XCS", "B000VKL6Z2", "B004SIP9O2", "B002ZG971U", "0780630874", "0780630882", "B002YICNE2", "B002XD0J80", "0780630904", "B0000CEB6Y", "0780630858", "B0026UZHS2", "B004EI2NP4", "B000KJU1KK", "B004SIP9P6", "B00DTPRZ24", "B001B1UO6W", "B004AC6PMG", "0783230451", "B00079Z9WI", "B008874968", "B004LWZW2O", "B0056P6SOG", "B00AEFY1NI", "B003HFUVQI", "B0002IQLH6", "B005CFBZQ6", "B00CERJI5U", "B000WC389G", "B000068IEV", "B008D1Q1Y2", "B00JF5GAIW", "B00BM4Q4H6", "B000GETUDI", "B0053TWVDC", "B001B8XRT6", "B0000AOX08", "B00018D42W", "B000069I05", "B005J9ZFQG", "B003THSXJ6", "B002GHHHG0", "B004SIP9MY", "B000PHX5NW", "B0002VYOVS", "B00105303S", "B0058S0OMS", "B001JFZ122", "6305972001", "B0000ALPFL", "B000WC3864", "B0000D9PNG", "B000FC2GA0", "B00275EHFU", "B0053TWVIM", "B000LC3ID8", "B008CYDD7I", "B000V4UFZK", "B00ETHN9L2", "B001L9EXUC", "B004SLIS7E", "B0091G7BTM", "B0085Z3ADQ", "B00005KH30", "B00005JND2", "B002HML6YI", "B00005A8XX", "B002LMSWN2"], "bought_together": ["B00AEFY2LO", "B00AEFY31S"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AEFY2E6", "B00AQJ8MLY", "B00AEFY31S", "B00AEFY37C"]}, "price": 8.23, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 111303}, "asin": "B00005NG6E", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51cpMCE%2BOTL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Friday the 13th, Part VI: Jason Lives"}

Loved by millions the world over, Judy was the brightest star in Hollywood's Golden Era. Away from the bright lights and brilliant performances, however, her devotion was to her family. But while she loved her children unconditionally, they could only desperately try and hang on to their mother as a powerful dependence on alcohol and prescription drugs began to consume her life. Based on the book by Garland's daughter Lorna Luft, and honored recipient of 5 Emmy Awards, LIFE WITH JUDY GARLAND: ME AND MY SHADOWS is a deeply moving testament to the healing powers of embracing one's past, facing one's demons, and charting a course of self-discovery!", "related": {"also_bought": ["B003B3V0X4", "B0013D8LI6", "B0000714B8", "B0001US6CI", "B0000714B6", "B00AATGDY8", "B000059QY9", "0671019007", "630521056X", "0385335156", "B000C65Z8Y", "067101899X", "B002BI4JKG", "B000EBD9RQ", "B004GJYR50", "B0001DCYUK", "B005VUTRGW", "B005F265FW", "B000BO0LF4", "0060113375", "B001A5HG24", "B00000I9CJ", "B00IXD2N1K", "B002IW62R8", "B000EBFLHC", "B0000714B9", "B00006IU5W", "B00D2CYU2W", "B000GETTIO", "B0000714BA", "B003V4JU1W", "B0001AW106", "0762437715", "B00004YZFX", "B00008L3MK", "B00005JNA9", "B00IZIGFNU", "B000WTZ63U", "B000WC39ZY", "B00AEFYNG8", "B00I04SVV8", "B0075FF5NA", "B00004STRE", "B005IA9K2G", "B00JPL3UTS", "B0036ZKLEQ", "1589797876", "B0054DPLUC", "B004H83IFU", "B00006RCO1", "B001NPDCFQ", "B009NYF2GQ", "B004VK744A", "B004SUDQ8G", "B002CAWNFQ", "B0013N2WFY", "B007VX03SS", "B003156IJ8", "B000O76ZR6", "0783114907", "B00GMM19X2", "B009VOLSA2", "B0008GGN9I", "B0017I79BW", "B001KP2J3U", "B00005O3VD", "B0033AI4PM", "B00005ALM7", "B0000AYJV8", "B00GOC74RU", "B00A33J8RK", "B0009PVZIW", "B004132I6Q", "B00DJFTBZI", "B008B4KVPQ", "B004GSVXAI", "1567994369", "B00GSBMNOQ", "B00I9BU5ZM", "B000KHI2FS", "B00CNW9ZEU", "B00AEFYO5I", "0375503781", "B00005QTA3", "0062278010", "B0012GN1Y8", "1451684568"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003B3V0X4", "B0013D8LI6", "0671019007", "B00AATGDY8"]}, "price": 6.83, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 50943}, "asin": "B00005U8QP", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/511EP8P9F5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Life with Judy Garland - Me and My Shadows"}

{"description": "Warping into syndication in 1987,Star Trek: The Next Generationsuccessfully launched its seven-season \"continuing mission\" of the starshipEnterprise, and this classy DVD boxed set gathers the show's inaugural  season in crisp picture clarity and dazzling 5.1-channel sound. A ratings leader  with a sharp ensemble cast, this revampedTrekhonored series creator  Gene Roddenberry's originalTrekconcept, nurtured by returning veterans  like producer Robert H. Justman and writers D.C. Fontana and David Gerrold.  Several first-season episodes have original-series counterparts, and while the  season was awkwardly inconsistent for all involved (including Roddenberry's heir  apparent, producer Rick Berman), in retrospect the series began on remarkably  solid footing.Patrick Stewart was perfect asEnterpriseCaptain Jean-Luc Picard, while  Marina Sirtis struggled with a wretched hair bun and an ill-defined character,  eventually blessing Counselor Troi with delicate nuance. Denise Crosby made a  strong but underutilized impression as Security Chief Tasha Yar, and left the  series before season's end, allowing writers to develop Klingon Lieutenant Worf  (Michael Dorn) into a fan favorite. Brent Spiner transcended Spock comparisons  with his triumphant portrayal of the android Lieutenant Commander Data; and  while Jonathan Frakes was accepted as First Officer Will Riker, fans ultimately  rejected Wil Wheaton as ensign Wesley Crusher, the teenaged son of the ship's  doctor (Gates McFadden). Still, these 25 episodes laid a firm foundation for  subsequent seasons, and highlights include the Raymond Chandleresque \"holo- novel\" of \"The Big Goodbye,\" Data's backstory in \"Datalore,\" the Klingon rituals  of \"Heart of Glory,\" and a Romulan encounter in \"The Neutral Zone.\" The DVD  supplements (all on the seventh disc) are good enough to make anyone wish for  more: four featurettes recall myriad first-season challenges, filled with  insider perspective and enoughNextGentrivia to satiate all but the most  obsessive Trekkers back on Earth.

{"description": "Hey, everybody, it's Bob and David on DVD! In 1995 comics Bob Odenkirk and David Cross were simply \"two people you've never seen before.\" Since then, each has insidiously entered the mainstream with appearances on TV (Just Shoot Me,The Drew Carey Show) and movies (Scary Movie 2,Dr. Dolittle 2,Men in Black 2). But to quote Odenkirk's bio (which is included on the first disc),Mr. Showis the thing you should see if you want to check them out. Like the late, lamentedThe Ben Stiller Show, on which both toiled, andMonty Pythonbefore that, this midnight-hour HBO series gave a subversive twist to the traditional sketch comedy series. Classic characters include Cross's white-trash poster boy Ronnie Dobbs, the superstar arrestee on a \"Cops\"-like TV show. Totally out of left field is an infomercial for an instructional video series by \"Van Hammersly, Champion Billiard Player,\" who at one point re-creates the 1974 Kentucky Derby with billiard balls (one of the equines is named \"If Mandy Patinkin Was a Horse\"). Punch lines?Mr. Showdoesn't need no stinking punch lines, as one sketch flows into another.Bob and David are ably supported by, among others, Second City veteran Jill Talley, Tom Kenny (the voice of Spongebob Squarepants!), Brian Posehn (the creepy guy onJust Shoot Me), Mary-Lynn Rajskub (fromThe Larry Sanders Show), Sarah Silverman (\"Greg the Bunny\"), and a pre-Saturday Night LiveJerry Minor, who enlivens one episode commentary with an impeccable Billy Dee Williams imitation. As with the Velvet Underground&#x92;s following,Mr. Showfans make up with fervor what they lack in numbers. According toMr. Show&#x92;s own Web site, \"non-fans outnumber our fans by the cajillions,\" but this essential set should change that.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00009W8JZ", "B0002ERXBS", "B00008PHCU", "B000RZGHT6", "B00L3PA8P8", "B000RZIGYA", "B00274SITW", "B00113YHXG", "1455526304", "B0001KL5HQ", "B000M341RS", "B001J4E1C4", "B0048LPRDC", "B000MTFDB0", "B000TGJ8EE", "B00267N3EU", "B000R7I3XC", "1416553657", "B000CQQID0", "0989387801", "B0089BSMWA", "B00009ZPU7", "B004U7MQW4", "B0002W4P98", "B0058JEHTS", "B0089BSNVK", "B0000TPA60", "B003NF97NU", "B0001FVDGY", "B0000E2FLB", "B0002V7NS4", "B004L9GLM2", "B000EXDS7K", "B00006G8J7", "B008F5HOXI", "B0058JEHSO", "B0000E2PVR", "B00116GEKW", "B000A9QKRI", "B000EBGFPY", "B00129W6LE", "B001L1S1PS", "B0007Y08LA", "B000FSME2Y", "B007C8RZL0", "B0001ZWLVU", "B0006UEVUE", "B00005JNEQ", "B003VVBZ7W", "B009XTF8KQ", "B000EMGIDC"], "bought_together": ["B00009W8JZ", "B0002ERXBS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000CQQID0", "B00008PHCU", "1455526304", "B000RZGHT6"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 108669}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 14.99, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00005Y3ZL", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51lP3bkCduL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Mr. Show: The Complete First and Second Season"}

{"description": "Retelling a story that has made it onto the silver screen more than most, this latest adaptation of The Count of Monte Cristo makes yet another swashbuckling attempt to win over a new generation of cinema goers. A dashing James Caviezel takes the role of the Count, who is driven by a desire for revenge after being betrayed by his best friend Fernand (played by a dishevelled Guy Pearce) and landed with 16 years of solitary confinement in Chateau D'If, a damp cavernous prison. Thus the scene is set for a good old-fashioned romp. The trouble with this \"re-imagining\" (to borrow a phrase from Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes) is that it's never quite sure whether to take itself seriously or not. Alexandre Dumas's original story is a traditionally melodramatic tale of deceit and double-crossing, with clear-cut bad guys and a moral lesson to be learned at the end. Here, director Kevin Reynolds appears unsure about whether to stick with tradition or bring the story up to date and turn it into a post-modern play on the old Victorian values and style. When the Count and his heavy-breathing loved one are reunited, their kiss is actually framed as a cameo. Both lead actors are also prone to heavy bouts of overacting, garnishing their performances with exaggerated baroque gestures. Clearly this is a film in which the actors could over-indulge themselves and (almost) get away with it, were it not for the fact that--bar Richard Harris as the \"Priest\"--none of them seem to have the faintest idea about how to conduct themselves in a period drama. This Count of Monte Cristo will leave the audience a little confused as to whether they should cry along with the story or laugh along with the actors. --Nikki Disney On the DVD: The Count of Monte Cristo on disc offers no escape from the dry drawl of director Kevin Reynolds, who features in almost every element of the extensive extras package.

{"description": "If you want the full sledgehammer-to-the-stomach effect ofAudition, stop reading this review now. Just watch it and take the consequences. At first glance, Takashi Miike's jack in the box of a movie works like a romantic comedy: amiable widower Shigeharu Aoyama (Ryo Ishibashi) decides it's time to find a new wife, and a friend suggests holding a fake audition to find the right girl. It soon becomes clear that there is something wrong with Aoyama's choice. This is no ordinaryFatal Attraction-style thriller, however;Auditionslowly and carefully builds into a wrenching exploration of both deep male fears and the stereotype of the cute, submissive Japanese woman.Auditionis by no means an easy movie to watch--even hardcore horror fans may have trouble--but it will stay with you for a long, long time.--Ali Davis", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000CABGW", "B000GSYRY6", "B001MEJY8W", "B0000CC885", "B0009S2T0M", "B000GBEWNY", "B00125WATQ", "B00006FDBW", "B00005JNJR", "B001I82RVS", "B001VG2MAI", "B004P2VQZ2", "B000BGH2A4", "B000ARFPMQ", "B000CRR3ME", "B000GI3RHY", "B002P7UCJK", "B000GB5MOW", "B006L4MWVE", "B00009W0U4", "B003VL3UR0", "B00GGY4R3K", "B005SQRYB4", "B001570H5K", "B000S0GYRU", "B0028DRGDQ", "B000MM0LH8", "B0014VPFVS", "B002EOVXBK", "B000Q7ZKWU", "B0009OUBC4", "B004KDYR20", "B001B187L6", "B006L4MWTQ", "B0000AVHAO", "B000FS9FIA", "B000E0OE4O", "B000E3LGMY", "B00005K9O8", "B000088NQR", "B0007XBM8O", "B0082A3HFK", "B002OVO18A", "B0009KA2UO", "B001D5C1R6", "B000274TLW", "B008G1JIQC", "B000PKG8TW", "B0015ET3YO", "B000JU7JIW", "B000FVQYW2", "B000WC38EQ", "B0007WQHI0", "B004XQO8MS", "B003Y7F1IW", "B002E01MHY", "6305228876", "B000BVM240", "B0016K76V4", "B001JV5BIA", "B000FS9FE4", "B00DW5IM14", "B004H2CXBQ", "B003KGBISE", "B000NA28GG", "B003TRMLQM", "B00BSU0FQA", "B000S0GYRK", "B000FZEQWI", "B000CSTKHE", "B001FOK70S", "B0083H6B0U", "B001MFNB4O", "B000MMLP9G", "B001MYIXAC", "B008CYDD7I", "B000A2XA8M", "B000IMUYJM", "B0007GAG42", "B003UTPL2A", "B00187FPC2", "0783228457", "B000H0M4CK", "B000069I0A", "157362408X", "B004O63TWW", "B004ZKKKW4", "B000H5U5YO", "B000MEYKCI", "B00008WJCJ", "B006U49SC6", "B0009KQOZQ", "B001J710Y8", "B004XQO8LY", "B001G9CNI6", "B00006FMCS", "B00104AYG0", "B00006AUIG", "B000096I9V"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001MEJY8W", "B0000CABGW", "B006L4MWTQ", "B004P2VQZ2"]}, "price": 1.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 202588}, "asin": "B0000640S9", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5113YQFBZDL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Audition"}

{"description": "IfBirthday Girlis a far-fetched thriller, it's also a slice of  absurdist fun populated by some awfully interesting actors. Nicole Kidman  plays Sophia, a chain-smoking, mascara-smudged, wildly sexual mail-order bride  from Russia who answers an Internet plea for companionship from a lonely  British bank employee, John (Ben Chaplin). For a while, the two make a  startling and intriguing pair: she apparently speaks no English and he  naively frets over the veracity of the Web business that brought them  together. The gorgeous Kidman and sad-eyed Chaplin are briefly the engine of  their own unique movie, but then the other shoe drops. Sophia, obviously up to  something mysterious, is paid a visit on her birthday by two Russian  \"cousins\" (French filmmaker Mathieu Kassovitz and one of his own frequent  stars, Vincent Cassel, also seen inBrotherhood of the Wolf).  Suddenly, John's quest for a lover becomes a web of deceit and corruption.  Directed and cowritten (with his brother Tom) by Jez Butterworth,Birthday Girlis hampered a bit by sluggishness and insufficient character  development. But it is also original and strikingly entertaining.Tom  Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0045O2PHS", "B0007P0X9G", "6305161933", "B004P7CMUU", "B000NO1XG8", "B0002DB52M", "B004AE3QYE", "B000068QPV", "B0002W4UDE", "B0013D8LKO", "B0011NVC8Y", "B006YTGLE0", "B009R8Q8Y8", "B00AEFYUQQ", "B00004Y87P", "B009B1EPQ4", "B000ASDFGI", "B005DR64OQ", "B00B4HM6XW", "B00006L92K", "6305310335", "B0000ZMGWK", "B00005JPUN", "B001CIOCLC", "B00AEFYUIO", "B0021L9M2I", "B009M4KTUG", "B008D1RD6W", "B0000640VK", "B0072BNJZ8", "B000ENC5YW", "B006YTGL86", "B00BSN0VZW", "B00AEFY8MM", "B00EVU3T26", "B00D3DJIG8", "B00CPTUO1Y", "B001E95ZNS", "B00HF98SPS", "B000DZ8540", "B00005JNQA", "B000ALM40I", "B004YCKKFK", "B00003CY5G", "B00096S494", "B0037QGS0A", "B00009OOFG", "B0010SAGHS", "B000FWHW68", "B0007W6HVM", "B00005LPZW", "B00DVH20MA", "B000EQHXNW", "B00030WW4O", "B00005U14H", "B000068V9U", "B00BTYJYP8", "B0010DM3R4", "B0045HCIYA", "B000YENUI6", "B00008L3S6", "B0041KKZIM", "078322933X", "B00260HH1W", "0790776960", "B007UW9W32", "B0009PW4BE", "B0010HOZS0", "B0064MT1LM", "6305213305", "B002UJIY2A", "0767812158", "B006GL8NQ0", "B002S5N052", "B0004Z32NI", "B0001932ZU", "B00BNWWVFG", "B0006GANPA", "B00005Y1UX", "B00CX7OW1G", "6305132917", "B003UAKEBW", "B008NA3I30", "6305308837", "B000EQ5SRK", "B00005O5B8", "B000DZ7YN8", "B00EMAGKNU", "B0059XTUB8", "B0040J1RX6", "B000AOEMT6", "B003IIST9U", "0783229402", "B0073U2EWM", "0767802616", "B00008972P", "B009OCR2U6", "B005Z9MGRG", "B000JBXXYK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0045O2PHS", "B004AE3QYE", "B0007P0X9G", "B004P7CMUU"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 92824}, "asin": "B000067J3P", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514VCGGEXQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Birthday Girl"}
{"description": "UFOwas Gerry Anderson's first live-action TV series after a decade of producing such children's animated classics asStingray(1963) andThunderbirds(1964). The premise ofUFO, which ran for a single season of 26 episodes in 1970, was like a more serious version of Anderson'sCaptain Scarlet(1967): in the near future of 1980, a high-tech secret organization, SHADO, waged covert war against mysterious alien attackers. Ed Bishop played the American head of SHADO--he had been previously featured inCaptain Scarletand Anderson'sDoppelganger(1969)--though in all other respects this was a thoroughly British production. As with all Anderson series,UFOevidenced remarkable technological inventiveness and groundbreaking production values, coupled with startling lapses in fundamental logic too numerous to list.Much more adult in story and content than earlier Anderson productions, and surprisingly dark with its pragmatic view of human nature and downbeat endings, the show now seems like a forerunner ofThe X-Filesand the equally short-livedDark Skies(1996). Barry Gray's memorable theme and atmospheric music greatly enhanced the overall impact. Stylishly made, though terribly sexist by current standards and featuring eye-catching costumes more fitted for a campy dress party than the front line of a futuristic war, this cult classic eventually evolved intoSpace 1999(1975).TheUFODVDs have been beautifully designed and produced. The mono sound is exceptionally strong, and the restored and remastered picture is almost unbelievably good for a 1970 TV show. With barely a flaw anywhere, the episodes look so clear, colorful, and detailed that they could have been filmed last week.

When his father, Nino (H&#xE9;ctor Alterio), decides  that after 44 years of marriage he wants to give his wife, Norma (Norma  Aleandro), the church wedding she always wanted, Rafael scoffs; Norma  has advanced Alzheimer's and doesn't recognize where she is or who's  around her. After Rafael has a heart attack, he realizes he has to  change his life--but when he makes changes, he discovers how much of  his life he'd been taking for granted, and that he may have cast aside  the very things he seeks.Son of the Brideis smartly and richly  written, directed with generosity and precision, and full of  astonishingly full performances. The story's full of clever touches,  but it never lets cleverness overwhelm humanity. Simply a superb movie.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00006G8G3", "B0036TGSJE", "B000K2V7F0", "B00008AOX5", "B004PKNYK4", "B002M2T1V8", "B00APOH5OA", "B008S2NABI", "B00080Z53O", "B0007NBJHI", "B00AZMFKXK", "B0047685T6", "B00005JNCZ", "B000G2YD2S", "B000N3T0DW", "B00005N8A9", "B002M2T1VI", "B000O76ZQC", "B000LV6OC6", "B0002TT0MI", "B0002RQ316", "B000RHRGSK", "B0042EJDGM", "B0039UX6EK", "B004XVMCMG", "B005LT0Z5A", "B00HRJVHEK", "B0041KKYF6", "B0036TGSJO", "B001BMN35K", "B000OCY7JE", "B003X3BYJM", "B000M7Y4S0", "B00180IPM6", "B004MNM1FI", "B005HFI7IU", "B0015ET3YO", "B00HW3EWQQ", "B00432M43C", "B005C5PV2K", "B00AIBZLHS", "B00005JLQW", "B00000F5KH", "B0014GI6I2", "B00F6SHGF8", "B007J7J9KO", "B005ERITFM", "B000QXDFR6", "B00075VX2C", "B002VECLXC", "B000QGE84M", "B000MGBLV4", "B001ILTUKQ", "B006JSY3KA", "B003A0T8BO", "B000T5O48A", "B00008G4H7", "B00H0EN948", "B00007G1V9", "B006KN393Q", "B000EHQ82S", "B00CQ8HCUK", "B0087IT8FK", "B00BY8U54S", "B0001KL4EK", "B000AYEIDQ", "B00393SFV6", "B005CFBZ3O", "B0041NZNF4", "B004LDEH60", "B0073U2EWM", "B000YIGNCC", "B00772HQTC", "B00097DY0C", "B000N3SU6K", "B00005JL57", "B00561BN8Q", "B000274TLW", "B004XVMCGW", "B003DW64YI", "B000E1NWH8", "B004Y2SDX6", "B002FHGESI", "B002W1HBM0", "B00006L92B", "B00G7QPXUI", "B00AZMFM3I", "B004IF4EVY", "B0006SGYLA", "6305972761", "B00008WJBU", "B0052LE7C4", "B00004VVO5", "B002EOVWVQ", "B000EULK14", "B001TX9VTI", "B000127YXI", "B00E1S1MMM"], "bought_together": ["B00006G8G3", "B0036TGSJE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0036TGSJE", "B000M7Y4S0", "B00006G8G3", "B000K2V7F0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 87137}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 23.95, "brand": "", "asin": "B00006BS7S", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51JR8AHXTTL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Son of the Bride"}

So everyone worries: what will become of Toula? Then one day she sees the ultimate unattainable guy and realizes the only way her life will get better is if he gets away from her big, fat Greek family. Toula escapes from the family restaurant. She exchanges her seating hostess jacket for a college diploma, convinces her aunt to give her a new job, and trades in her coke-bottle glasses for contact lenses, just in time for \"him\" to walk back into her life. Ian Miller is tall, handsome but defnitely not Greek. Their courtship is an Olympian culture clash. Can Ian handle Toula, her parents, her aunts, uncles, cousins and several centuries of Greek heritage? Will Toula discover the love she's been missing right in the heart of her big, fat family?

{"description": "Think ofScotland, PA.as truck-stop Shakespeare,Macbethgiven a drive-through makeover as the deadliest of deadpan comedies. Writer-director Billy Morrissette got this wacky idea from an early job at Dairy Queen. He makes the most of that bad memory by casting his own wife (ER's Maura Tierney) and indie stalwart James LeGros as Pat and Mac McBeth, a married pair of Pennsylvanian schemers, circa 1973, who plot to escape their thankless jobs at Duncan's burger joint. They dispatch Duncan in a sizzling accident (you want fries with that corpse?) and inherit the diner from Duncan's stoner son (who's also a suspect), hoping to prove to Detective McDuff (Christopher Walken, at his funniest) that their newfound happiness is entirely legal. LikeThe Big Lebowski, this movie's hilarious if you're in on the joke, and familiarity with Shakespeare is optional when you've got a \"rock block\" of Bad Company hits to keep the grisly comedy on track.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00443FMKM", "B000063JZQ", "0982153309", "B000SIWH0U", "B0002TVWYW", "B002E01MBA", "B0000BXMZ2", "B00005U8EL", "B004SIP83Y", "B008D1A18E", "B000E6ESKS", "B000OY9VFW", "B00003CY24", "0792844041", "B009PM2BDS", "B00J379KKW", "B000K2Q7H8", "B00GBT62N8", "B00B1E6EAY", "1439172250", "B000K7VHLY", "B00B6OEEKQ", "B00005JLCI", "B0038RSJ0U", "B004M9ZI0M", "B00ECR7KX2", "B000777I88", "B00004W4UB", "B00BOYI9FY", "6305972761", "B00H4BHIGW", "B00B2BYY1W", "0743288505", "B00007AJFY", "B00019072G", "B00063MC1Q", "B00DQN6IOK", "B00447L4KA", "B00008AOWI", "B00008DDUF", "B005COLEOA", "B00AJER4EM", "B0059XTUR2", "B002SF9YMU", "B0059XTUT0", "B000QGE8IS", "0780021312", "B00AMEZDPG", "B00030IOZ0", "B00A7OBIGO", "6305813019", "B00002E20R", "B00005JLRE", "B00GMV8KGW", "0415539382", "0393977862", "B00000JL7T", "B0041SI78O", "B004SIP9U6", "B001TR4G6W", "B00AGKHF1G", "B00019JRFY", "B0012EM5CE", "B00G5GNZ78", "B000059LGL", "B00007L4OB", "B0013D8LWC", "B0051HCUIW", "B000BR6QCI", "B00006G8HO", "6305622876", "1411498712", "0198324006", "1408133474", "B003H0ZGWW", "B001RUALEC", "B000069HZU", "1558908331", "B0007WRT4Q", "B000ALAT64", "B00EE8AIP6", "B000KJU182", "B00CDV4JNS", "0385722141", "B005FSS536", "079284615X", "B00JAQJNN0", "1590171691", "B007JVSRKS", "B00003CXUM", "B00005LZOD", "B008D19ZPY", "B00005BCK9", "0345524500", "B00BQHA0M4", "B00006RCMU", "B0002DB52M", "0743477103", "B001WLMOL4", "0486297659"], "bought_together": ["B00443FMKM", "B0002TVWYW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00443FMKM", "B000063JZQ", "0982153309", "B000SIWH0U"]}, "price": 14.04, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 212804}, "asin": "B00006G8IB", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51VD1S327EL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Scotland, PA."}

{"description": "A grainy, enigmatic videotape has the power to kill people seven days after they watch it. This brilliant premise fueled the 2002 Hollywood hitThe Ring, but before that it conquered Japan inRingu, Hideo Nakata's quietly unsettling study in terror. Fans of the U.S. version will find a less elaborate storyline and more primal fear in the original; the basic plot, however, still has a worried reporter (Nanako Matsushima) tracking down the meaning of the video--and, having watched it herself, she has only a week to work. The film's calm, economical style actually adds to the creeping sense of dread throughout, and the hair-curling set-pieces stand out in contrast. Like an old photograph of something evil,Ringuhas the strange-but-familiar power to unnerve. Guaranteed, its effect will linger for at least seven days.

{"description": "Since winning an Academy Award for his exuberant performance inJerry Maguire, Cuba Gooding Jr. has gotten little but static from critics for a spate of calamitous career choices not seen since '80s-vintage Burt Reynolds. But he triumphantly returns to Oscar-worthy status with his moving performance as Radio, a mentally challenged young man, whom South Carolina high school football coach Harold Jones (Ed Harris) takes under his nurturing wing. This does not play well with the school's patient but questioning principal (Alfre Woodard); the school's biggest athletic booster, who views Radio as a distraction; the man's son, the team's star player, who plays cruel pranks on the trusting Radio; and the Coach's teenage daughter, who feels neglected. Almost all will be won over by Radio's trusting and good nature. Based on aSports Illustratedstory,Radiowas adapted for the screen by Mike Rich, screenwriter ofThe Rookie, and as in that superior family film, the heroics are mostly off the field. As Coach says, with all the subtlety of a blitz, \"We're not the ones been teaching Radio; he's the one been teaching us.\" The ending, in which we see the actual Radio, still cheering his team on 26 years later, will melt the most cynical hearts.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JPBO", "B002VECM6S", "B000056VP4", "B000066HAS", "B00004W221", "B000J3OTT6", "B000EXZFCQ", "0792843592", "6305531293", "B00AEFXOKO", "B000068NNU", "B001LGXIA6", "B002NZK5UK", "0788815466", "B000KHYN9C", "6305428352", "B0001US66Y", "B000N6U0E2", "B00000IQV7", "B00004TJQJ", "B002D755AI", "B00125WAWS", "B0006FYOTC", "B00AEBB9F0", "B00005JNEW", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00KPYT9PS", "B000FVQLQQ", "B000KLQUS0", "B0068FZ0GK", "B000Q7ZNZ4", "B002VWNIBI", "B000K2UGZM", "B001FB55NK", "B004KPLVX6", "B00722MQE2", "B0026S2TU8", "B004DK5CW4", "B0001ADAVK", "630542845X", "B00005JKWX", "B000CDSS18", "B0000YTP02", "B00006HAWN", "B00AEFZ63M", "6305133468", "B00AEFXOE0", "B009NNM9OA", "B000MNOX94", "B000PHVZNE", "B00AEFY17E", "B000G1R394", "B001QB5SS6", "B005OZVXCU", "B000FVR1T2", "B0000AM6NV", "B002YMWQ2M", "B002VWNICM", "B0023UZBBI", "B009YQJ2Q4", "B00005JMCN", "B0026JI1R2", "B0002TSZI8", "B000KF0GWW", "078324021X", "6305428387", "B0038M2AZA", "B008FCX2D2", "B000QQLVPQ", "0767836359", "0783225733", "B000X5RBXG", "B004SEUJOQ", "B00KD5HFJG", "B00AMEZDJW", "B00AEFXV3E", "B000RBA6C4", "B00AEFXY6I", "0767802497", "B000FFJYB6", "B000274T94", "B0000648ZR", "B00133KFGW"], "bought_together": ["B002VECM6S", "B000056VP4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000X5RBXG", "B000056VP4", "B000J3OTT6", "B00005JPBO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 13680}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.95, "brand": "Team Marketing", "asin": "B00008EY60", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510370Y4VYL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Radio"}
{"description": "TheIdentityDVD features are not quite as enticing as they sound.  Of chief interest is the extended branched version of the film (available in widescreen only), but there's only one added scene (an interesting but not critical minute-long sequence that would have been the first conference-room scene), and the differences in the alternate ending are so subtle that you'll miss them if you literally blink a few times.  There's no question it could affect audience perception, but unlike most alternate endings, it doesn't affect the actual outcome.  (Seespoilerfor more information.)  The four deleted scenes (which don't include either of the above-mentioned additions) aren't that exciting, and the optional director commentary notes that these deletions generally served to cut moments of character and comic relief in favor of moving the story along, which is one reason the film runs a brisk 90 minutes. James Mangold's director commentary on the feature is good, though, as he discusses such matters as the logistics of the perpetual downpour and a crucial bit of dialogue removed from the film's climax.  Considering that downpour and the contrasting darks and lights of the film, picture quality is good, and the thunder claps sound great in 5.1 sound so there are no complaints about the DVD's presentation of the film itself.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000TJ6PBK", "B00006AUJR", "B0009YA3OA", "B000DZ7YN8", "B00005JNY3", "B00AADAK5W", "1558908382", "B00008K77D", "B0002DB54A", "B000RGN2JI", "B00AEBB8NI", "B000P0I4O4", "B00003CXZ4", "B004ZNFTDQ", "B0015XHQVC", "B00026ZD04", "B00014NEZI", "B003LR5BD0", "B00092ZLSK", "B004SIP92O", "B00000JGHL", "B003VA3JUO", "B00BNH9NCU", "B00DZP1C2W", "B00I45844W", "B004YCKKFK", "B00011CZRE", "B0002234LS", "B001HVZOB6", "B005S9EJ8W", "B000A2UBN4", "B00HOGBXS6", "B000OYC7BW", "B0004Z31OS", "B00AEBB89W", "B00AEFXW8I", "B00009OWJY", "B002NZK5RI", "B00AEFXEGS", "B00007AJF8", "B003ASLJQ8", "B000R4SMCW", "B000069HZP", "B00003CXGA", "B00005V9HH", "B0001FR3IQ", "B00005JPT0", "B000SK5Z20", "B00008YJDK", "B0013D8LBS", "6305238065", "B0021L8UFI", "B004P7CN7W", "078322799X", "B001OQCV2E", "B0002WT4OE", "B00B6OEB18", "B00003CXKM", "B004SIP9RO", "B000RZIGUE", "B004B3PBFQ", "B004LWZW24", "B00AEFXT1S", "B00096S49Y", "B000LC55F2", "0783240295", "B00009L1TA", "B0034G4P30", "B002O3Z4WK", "B00005JLO8", "B001ILFUBE", "B00005JKIS", "B004SIP9MY", "6305718954", "B000ALM40I", "B0001Z52RU", "B0010X73ZG", "B000A5045Q", "B00005JMWP", "B00005JN2Z", "B000F5WR4W", "B0000648X0", "B0021L8UPS", "B00AEBBA2W", "6301971345", "B002UJIY7A", "B0006IIKQW", "B00B96TGQS", "B004BLJQOK", "B00AEFXKZ8", "6304806434", "B001NPD9LS", "B000U1ZV76", "B003L20IEW", "B00596WFE4", "B000GCFO0I", "B00005UQ9W", "B000053UIF", "B0000YTOL2"], "bought_together": ["B000TJ6PBK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000TJ6PBK", "B0012Q7M02", "B00006AUJR", "B00AEBBA2W"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 30202}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.73, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B00008EY9G", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RKTbv5kkL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Identity"}

{"description": "Now that enough time has lapsed, we can all have a good laugh overSouth  Parkcreators Trey Parker and Matt Stone's amusing little April Fools  prank, in which they kicked off the show's second season not with the  conclusion to season one's cliffhanger that would reveal the identity of  Cartman's father, but with an all-Terrance, all-Phillip, all-farting episode,  \"Not Without My Anus.\" The ensuing outcry illustrated just how seriously its  devoted fans takeSouth Park. There is little evidence of sophomore  slump in this three-disc collection of 18 episodes that continue the  coming-of-age trials of third graders Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny.  There  is considerable shock value just in the episode titles alone, among them  \"Cojoined Fetus Lady,\"  \"Merry Christmas, Charlie Manson,\" and the  infamous \"Cartman's Mom Is Still a Dirty Slut.\" But mostly, the episodes  are just--in Cartman's words--hella funny. \"Spookyfish\" is a creepfest  about a killer fish, possessed animals, and alien alter egos (in which the  so-called Evil Cartman is much nicer than the real Cartman) presented in  Spookyvision, with pictures of Barbra Streisand framing the screen. \"Chef's  Salty Chocolate Balls\" is a hilarious send-up of the Sundance Film Festival  and the indie film scene that marks the return of Mr. Hankey, the Christmas  Poo, and ends with the burial of Robert Redford in excrement.As always, hard-earned life lessons provideSouth Parkwith fertile territory for  skewed and subversive social commentary. In \"Chicken Lover,\" Ayn Rand'sAtlas Shruggedis an argument against literacy. \"Underwear Gnomes\"  makes a strong case for corporate takeover of local family business.  It is  difficult to respect Warner Bros.' \"authoritah\" with the scant DVD extras.   There are no commentaries, but Parker and Stone are present to introduce most  of the episodes, each of which they proclaim to be their favorite. But their  incarnations as abusive retirement center entertainers and as the hosts of an  all-bacon cooking show fall flat. Bring back Rootin'-Tootin' Trey Parker and  Pistol-Slingin' Matt Stone from theSeason Oneset!--Donald  Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000CABL2", "B00023P49C", "B0001ZWLVU", "B0006Z2L2Y", "B000ADWCYY", "B000CNESM6", "B000FSME2Y", "B000KLQUMQ", "B000R7I3XC", "B0018O5WUU", "B001O0TWXG", "B0030Y11UG", "B006W93ELK", "B004MLEYTG", "B009SQ9Q5M", "B000022TSW", "B000USUA8E", "B000LW7OKQ", "B00AEBB8TM", "B00105308I", "B001O0TWXQ", "B006W93EM4", "B000ZT0S9O", "B0030Y11NS", "B004MLEYT6", "B000OPO0LQ", "B009SQ9Y7M", "B003VJTGKW", "B000083C6V", "B0001MZ7KA", "B0000AQS81", "0762435615", "B000AQ68Z0", "B000UAE7UE", "B008412UKA", "B00008YGRV", "B009WSJHD2", "B006IOAHTQ", "B001CQONKO", "B00008YGRS", "B000B5XOR0", "B00CJEKA2I", "B000HT3P6U", "030789682X", "B00000J8BV", "B00CJEK7GW", "B000067DNE", "B00G4RDR1W", "B003L77G7Y", "B006IOAHPK", "B000E0OE3K", "B000RO6JZO", "B000B5XOWU", "B00K8HAJN8", "B007KFZ7UQ", "B00G4RCB14", "B00C28X8IY", "B007ZFR67I", "B008412UQ4", "B000P2A6CA", "0762435704", "B007KFZ8AA", "B0012KSUTA", "B0002WZRSG", "B007KFZ85K", "B0002NY8XA", "B00G4RCF60", "0783230338", "B007KFZ88M", "B001RIZ7OI", "B003CN5B7E", "B001VFM0ZG", "B001KKU9DW", "B00FEQ6IG0", "B00000I1BB", "B001G0MFFG", "B000NNK4DM", "B000H2M2R0", "B000F9T700", "B000GIXLWA", "B0024FAR52", "B000RPD0DC", "B000PAAJZG", "B00CJEK8WA", "6305301700", "B0007PAM06", "B001EOQVA4", "B007KFZ7YM", "B004QP7WTC", "0762438231", "B00D1955A2", "B00005JM3G", "B0007CILMA", "B005K5AOUQ", "B000EHSVG4", "B0002XVQT4", "B005QIOJ3A", "B003W5TO70"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00023P49C", "B0000CABL2", "B0001ZWLVU", "B000FSME2Y"]}, "price": 1.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 81889}, "asin": "B00008O32J", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51PQSX5M7ZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "South Park - The Complete Second Season"}

{"description": "\"Matters of Honor\" launchedBabylon 5's third season with the introduction of theWhite Star, a spacecraft added to enable more of the action to take place away from the station. Also introduced was Marcus Cole (Jason Carter)--in another nod toThe Lord of the Rings, a Ranger not so far removed from Tolkien's Strider. In \"Voices of Authority\" the show finds an epic scale as Ivanova seeks the mysterious \"First Ones\" for allies against the Shadows, and evidence is discovered pointing to the truth behind President Santiago's assassination. A third of the way through the season \"Messages from Earth,\" \"Point of No Return,\" and \"Severed Dreams\" prove pivotal, changing the nature of the story in a way previously unimaginable on network TV. Earth slides into dictatorship, the fascistic Nightwatch takes control of off-world security, and Sheridan take decisive action by declaring Babylon 5 independent.\"Interludes and Examinations\" presented the death of a major supporting character, while the two-part \"War Without End\" reached apocalyptic dimensions in a complex tale resolving the destiny of Sinclair and the fate ofBabylon 4(dovetailing elegantly with the events of thefirst season's \"Babylon Squared\"), resolving a 1,000-year-old paradox and presenting a vision of a very dark future for Sheridan and Delenn. All this was trumped by the monumental \"Z'ha'dum.\" In the preceding \"Shadow Dancing\" Anna Sheridan (Melissa Gilbert, Bruce Boxleitner's real-life wife) returned from the dead, no longer entirely human. In the mythologically resonant climax Anna invited Sheridan back to the Shadow homeworld with no hope of survival. Just as inThe Lord of the RingsGandalf fell into the abyss at Khazad-Dum, so Sheridan took a comparable leap into the unknown on an alien world.--Gary S.

{"description": "The 2001 romantic Bollywood dramaKabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham(\"Happiness and Tears\") proved to be even more successful thanKuch Kuch Hota Hai, the highest-grossing Indian film of all time and one that was also directed by Karan Johar. Starring veteran actor Amitabh Bachchan and wife Jaya, this tells the story of an Indian family who live in palatial comfort but who are riven when the eldest, adopted son Rahul marries Anjali (Kajol) a feisty and attractive woman but whose \"lower breeding\" causes his father to disapprove of her. Breaking his mother's heart, Rahul moves to Britain with Anjali before younger brother Rohan tries to go after him and end 10 years of estrangement to reunite the family.Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Ghamis packed with contemporary trappings and production values but is in every way a traditional and generic Hindi movie. Those new to Bollywood might be disconcerted by some of the fashion statements or the mixture of drawn-out, lachrymose melodrama and slightly overplayed comedy-romantic interplay between Rahul and Anjali. There are also some scenes around Leicester Square and Westminster that are almost insulting in their stereotyping of hot, swinging London. However,K3G--as it has become affectionately known--is a riot of joyful color, music and choreography (an embarrassing version of \"It's Raining Men\" is an exception). This is not a crossover movie, perhaps but a sumptuous treat for Bollywood fans.--David Stubbs", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00004W4GG", "B001LQMK9G", "B0010SAG32", "B0009UUMRM", "B0016GOJJK", "B0038WU0D4", "B00124ONSI", "B00ATSQJS0", "B0026I0NEC", "B000LMPNO0", "B000AC538M", "B0016GOLZM", "B003N5VOUO", "B0038WU0CK", "B0063V696O", "B00FOP6SOI", "B0002CVQHW", "B005DJDF2I", "B000HDZ96U", "B0012IT79O", "B00HVA3F0E", "B00HR6HYS6", "B001M3X5WO", "B000JLSRA0", "B0015B04EA", "B00HDOH8JW", "B00EI3YF2E", "B002VJ4P36", "B000IZJRDI", "B000IZJQU2", "B0001H9MYM", "B0001EQI8I", "B001KQFAO4", "B000IZJRJW", "B007QXMGEM", "B002UV0ZNE", "B00008OP59", "B000LXGV9A", "B00008N72F", "B0038WU0DY", "B000IZJR6A", "B009EOMNSA", "B003UHUYH4", "B000621P5Q", "B006YP4FMY", "B004IM2M70", "B00ABW5Q3I", "B003H2LKFC", "B000KCHW3G", "B003BYITXW", "B001O3XB4Y", "B000N3TWRG", "B004TK1PJC", "B000WOQKL2", "B0002IAQO0", "B00JE9WAQU", "B001UNSZWQ", "B001N6FPRI", "B0038WU0G6", "B00009W8OZ", "B00F1RTVWA", "B004O0U264", "B000LXSAMG", "B0000AP9V0", "B000IZJR0G", "B004F0LEMO", "B00005JMNV", "B000IZJRX8", "B00BAY1EOQ", "B001L7XXIC", "B000GHG114", "B0016GON28", "B004V7IKUA", "B00008N72Q", "B008MIOSYG", "B00094AS9U", "B002SZL7A2", "B00IJXWMC4", "B00192QM78", "B0000APAEN", "B000OV3Q7Y", "B00008V6Y5", "B000IZJRXI", "B005GTMSQY", "B0011W8DQY", "B001K3GO8S", "B004GYWZZY", "B00HU60DRM", "B003KNE6EK", "B001AO2OLI", "B000R939DY", "B005OOZKPC", "B00KMRPHMM", "B00AGEVZB8", "B000OUWM0C", "B000IZJRRY"], "bought_together": ["B00004W4GG", "B0016GOMZG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0009UUMRM", "B00004W4GG", "B0010SAG32", "B0012IT79O"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 231012}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 15.4, "brand": "", "asin": "B0000AMAFR", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/319o5BmqwjL.jpg", "title": "Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham..."}

{"description": "In the sitcomThe King of Queens, comedian Kevin James has created a  new archetype: the sensitive lug. This deceptively simple comedy bounces  along because delivery man Doug Heffernen (James), though completely a  guy's guy, constantly struggles to keep the world around him in a delicate  emotional balance. Meanwhile, his wife Carrie (Leah Remini), though  utterly feminine (and one of the sexiest women on television), uses the  kind of no-nonsense rational approach that's usually a man's province. Add  to this mix Carrie's father Arthur (Jerry Stiller), whose life as a fussy,  self-absorbed retiree makes him more like their child than an adult, and  you've got the building blocks for an excellent and durable show.The  first season ofThe King of Queensquickly found its voice with  stories firmly rooted in the everyday world, rarely spinning off into  absurdity--and why should it, when there's such a wealth of humor to be  found in petty neuroses (when Doug gets assigned an attractive young woman  as a trainee at work, he gets hurt when Carrie isn't remotely jealous),  ill-advised scheming (to weasel out of a traffic ticket, Carrie agrees to  go out on a date with the cop who pulled her over), and juggling  obligations to friends and family (just about every episode). Brilliant  comic bits abound; one classic moment features Doug and Carrie having a  furious argument in absolute silence at a cello concert--a scene that  fuses deft physicality, well-developed characters, and sheer silliness.The King of Queensis a delight.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0001BS3IY", "B00070HK4C", "B000957O8C", "B000FBH3WC", "B000GRU09S", "B000TGJ82G", "B000NA1W3Q", "B000K4X5QM", "B0001ZMWXW", "B004D2GMVM", "B0007R4SWC", "B00005JOHC", "B000A7PKGW", "B000BNTM46", "B00009Y3RW", "B00005JLEX", "B006MFQ4DE", "B00005JLIB", "B005D0OHA6", "B00B04NII6", "B00008NV4G", "B000GRUMQY", "B000T22PVG", "B002AMVEEM", "B00B04NJ1M", "B000N8UXTW", "B0002NY8R6", "B004MWLXTY", "B0009YCLBS", "B005DCJ0Q0", "B0000C9JFQ", "B0058J3S16", "B000M341S2", "B001DZOCVO", "B0058JEHSO", "B0058EE6O4", "B0002UE1WQ", "B008L0YN18", "B0058EE6NK", "B003L77G7E", "B008L0YMZA", "B000068CNX", "B0007YXRCW", "B005FISCFW", "B003TNW02G", "B007C8RZJW", "B004WO9OMA", "B007C8RZL0", "B00008J2EB", "B002WQ799U", "B0001NBNJ8", "B005XLFB32", "B007C8RZQ0", "B002JH2EJ2", "B000068V9Y", "B009LDD3I8", "B001NFNFM6", "B000291Q3O", "B0024FAR6Q", "B0009E27DA", "B000RW3VDE", "B003SNJO5S", "B002N5N4PS", "B0002W4SWW", "B0058JEI06", "B0006J27WY", "B003Y5H4ZW", "B00005JM3G", "B007C8RZYC", "B0038Q9Q94", "B0019D151K", "B000KX0IPO", "B0019CSXAM", "B0024FAD9W", "B000W91RUG", "B002JVWQUU", "B0006Q93AQ", "B000SQFC0O", "B000I2J6VE", "B00000F5W8", "B001NPK5BU", "B00005JO2V", "B0007US79Y", "B008LCRAFC", "B0002234R2", "B000F8O2MO", "B001DJLCR2", "B0001O3YLM", "B000P6YNTI", "B009X919YU", "B000EU1QC2", "B008LCRA7K", "B000TD4N9W", "B0058JEHTS", "B001QE99AQ", "B000MGBLEQ", "B00008YGRV", "B001L1S1PS", "B000EBGFQI"], "bought_together": ["B0001BS3IY", "B00070HK4C"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005D0OHA6", "B000FBH3WC", "B000NA1W3Q", "B0001BS3IY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 16725}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 10.06, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B0000CGNEC", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514XDJA5YQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The King of Queens: Season 1"}

{"description": "While fans breathlessly await the fate of the computer-animatedNew Adventures of Spider-Man(it remains in limbo after being dropped by MTV in 2003), they can enjoy all 13 episodes of its first season on this two-disc set, which includes a wealth of extras. Mainframe Entertainment (which created the cult Saturday morning seriesReBoot) and writer/executive producer Brian Michael Bendis (theUltimate Spider-Mancomic) give the venerable story a spin by placing Peter Parker (voiced by Neil Patrick Harris) in college alongside pal Harry Osborn (Ian Ziering) and longtime crush Mary Jane Watson (singer Lisa Loeb). As usual, Parker/Spidey must conceal his secret identity while wrangling a host of foes, which are a mix of ones drawn from the comic book (The Lizard, Kraven the Hunter) and brand new enemies (Talon, voiced by rapper Eve). Spider-Man fans seem firmly divided into \"for\" and \"against\" camps over the animation, which beautifully captures Spidey's web-slinging, but often looks awkward when depicting everyday movement. Die-hard series viewers and Spider-Man/Marvel collectors in general will be pleased by the set, which includes behind-the-scenes featurettes and commentary by the creators.--Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002A5EBLW", "B0007RT9MG", "B00006II6Q", "B0000633UA", "B00IGVJH0E", "B002O5M4SK", "B0001I55N8", "B00007G205", "B0037FFBPO", "B0036EH3XO", "B0001I55O2", "B0007US7CQ", "B002WY65TM", "B001OXLGJ6", "B002WY65TC", "B0025AY3X8", "B001OXLGJG", "B00A4DML6E", "B00157OI9Q", "B001T6KW4I", "B003XTUAHS", "B007549WKI", "B000089G5S", "B0074JOVIW", "B00005Y71G", "B004MYYHG8", "B007IKKSNY", "B001KP2J2Q", "B000OPODNQ", "B0002ZMHX6", "B00GJ6HQDI", "B00004WLXP", "B000B7QCGS", "B007549XLG", "B004MYYHGI", "B005BXY1RE", "B00005JKCH", "B002K0WBDM", "B00DYV1ROK", "B000FZETS4", "B00HMOW9YM", "B00BTJV9RO", "B008FYZHLK", "B00368PSIM", "B001QIVEVE", "B000CEXFZ6", "B000CEVC9M", "B00A8GBVOK", "B005BXY1PG", "B003XTUAWI", "B000EOTUTO", "B00HFWETQW", "B002WNUVK2", "B002FGUHBE", "B00J8LXD60", "B00005JMQW", "B00BACT1I4", "B000K7UBTI", "B000M2E32W", "0307931072", "B000A9QKL4", "B003HKN548", "B00023E894", "B000F0V0LS", "B00I099JZK", "B00ISDJUYI", "B00HXH00YE", "B00GD9GNEY", "B00FM4S7KO", "B004PHE9FQ", "B00GZ0ML2Y", "B001QIVEVO", "B0007XFZMS", "B000OPODNG", "B0016OM3WC", "B000TSTEMS", "B00I40K6RU", "B00005Y71J", "B007ILZAA4", "B004QOB8PW", "B00HMOWA0A", "B000F4RH8E", "B000A9QKLO", "B000CSTK42", "B000PC8AKK", "B002JUFPJK", "B00HXH0102", "B003DYD926", "B000R5OFOA", "B001614E68", "B00JL6L4WC", "B000FP2YYA", "B00JPS6A3O", "B002LWJ510", "B0027WNRV8", "B000LE17A2", "B000A59PLU"], "bought_together": ["B002A5EBLW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00IGVJH0E", "B002A5EBLW", "B001QIVEVE", "B0007RT9MG"]}, "price": 12.38, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 40313}, "asin": "B0000VCZLG", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51U1pv9dyHL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Spider-Man: The New Animated Series (Special Edition)"}

{"description": "Based on the bestseller by John Grisham,Runaway Juryis a slick thriller that's exciting enough to overcome the gaps in its plot. The ultimate target has been changed: Grisham's legal assault on the tobacco industry was switched to the hot-button issue of gun control (no doubt to avoid comparison toThe Insider) in a riveting expos&#xE9; of jury-tampering. Gene Hackman plays the ultra-cynical, utterly unscrupulous pawn of the gun-makers, using an expert staff and advanced electronics to hand-pick a New Orleans jury that will return a favorable verdict; Dustin Hoffman (making his first screen appearance with real-life former roommate Hackman) defends the grieving widow of a gun-shooting victim with idealistic zeal, while maverick juror John Cusack and accomplice Rachel Weisz play both ends against the middle in a personal quest to hold gun-makers accountable. It's riveting stuff, even when it's obvious that Grisham and director Gary Fleder have glossed over any details that would unravel the plot's intricate design.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783226942", "B000P5FH3K", "B002NZK5R8", "B00AEFXYJA", "B002NZK5UU", "0767810872", "B002NZK5VO", "B0000694XY", "630542828X", "B00AEFXT1S", "B0006HBZBA", "B0045HCJ8K", "B0000C3I8M", "B004EPYZP8", "B0010YSD7W", "B00096S49Y", "B000063US3", "B000R4SMCW", "1558908382", "B001NY4WYC", "B003ASLJIQ", "6305428115", "B00005B6JZ", "B00005JL8F", "B00005UQ9T", "B00008EY9G", "B00008K77D", "0800141806", "B00005JPT0", "B00003CXFV", "B000P0I4O4", "B000CEV3M8", "B00441GYPG", "0790732149", "B000SFOW8I", "B000TJ6PBK", "0783240295", "B001I2EQUY", "B000055Y0Y", "B000NTMA0Q", "B002O3Z4ZW", "B002AT8KAG", "0790730979", "B00003CY5G", "B0038Z5T4Q", "B004SIP9RO", "B004YCKKFK", "B002AS464Q", "B00AMSM9DG", "0783226888", "B00AADAK5W", "B0031OCY2E", "B002DU39GW", "B00000K3TU", "B002LMV7R0", "B0013D8LBS", "B000GFLKF8", "B000CEXEWA", "B00008L3S6", "B00005ATZT", "B00AEBB9UK", "6304806434", "B002AT8K9W", "B00AEFXEGS", "B003ASLJQ8", "B0043X1FNQ", "B000BNX3B4", "B001CC7PLM", "B002QW7AMG", "B000JYW5BE", "B000Y11B8U", "B001HVZOB6", "B00BLN4UKQ", "B005NKIPUY", "B00015YVDG", "B00H91LWDC", "0792844874", "6305657947", "B003L20IG0", "0780618548", "B00DWZHTOU", "B003Q6D2B4", "B000ENC5YW", "B00GUO2SKA", "B0010YVCB6", "B00009WVSL", "B000G5SILC", "B000F8DV1M", "B00FQRZ6EM", "B000OYAT3U", "B00AEFXIIW", "B008JFURII", "B00005JNQA", "B002O3Z4XY", "B000059XTK", "B00005JN5E", "B001ECDVK4", "B000K7VHQ4", "B00000JGHL"], "bought_together": ["B000P5FH3K", "0783226942"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001I2EQUY", "B000P5FH3K", "B00AEFXYJA", "B002NZK5VO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 38867}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.67, "brand": "Twentieth Century Fox", "asin": "B00014NEZI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51X52Z0CBSL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Runaway Jury (Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "The compellingCoyote Waitsis based on one of the Leaphorn and Chee mystery novels by Tony Hillerman (all three have been adapted for television), concerning a partnership, of sorts, between an experienced Navajo detective, Joe Leaphorn (Wes Studi), and a young reservation cop, Jim Chee (Adam Beach). When the latter's colleague and friend ends up shot to death and left to burn in a fiery car, Chee takes time off to evaluate whether he should become a healer instead of a lawman. Either way, he can't proceed without getting to the bottom of the killing and proving or disproving his own original assumption that the murderer is a shaman he found drunk and in possession of a gun near the crime.  Working the case from a different angle is Leaphorn, who finds a link between the shaman and a missing university professor on the trail of a major historical find. Beach and Studi are terrific, though the story doesn't bring them together, in the same space, very often. (The two characters do most of their communicating by phone.) Familiar faces in the supporting cast include Gary Farmer (Dead Man), Keith Carradine (Deadwood), and Graham Greene (Dances with Wolves).

{"description": "Like the movie, the DVD extras are smarter and a lot more entertaining than your average flick. The making-of feature (\"Lessons Learned\") has the usual behind-the-scenes banter but Jack Black is in fine form--that is, something special--interviewing as much as being interviewed about the making of the film. His unique pitch to Led Zeppelin to use their song is alone worth the price of the DVD. Black is more his maniacal self and a bit more grating in MTV's Diary segment, but his commentary track with director Richard Linklater is as insightful as it is funny. Ok, it's a lot more funny, but entertaining throughout. The commentary track featuring just the kid actors is less so, but any preteen would love listening to it. To top it off, the DVD-ROM has Dewey Finn's instantly famous blackboard history of rock. You can drill down to the bands mentioned and get a brief history of each.

{"description": "The comedy/dramaFreaks and Geekslimped through its sole season on NBC in 1999 before being expelled by the network--but not before earning critical acclaim and a devoted fan base that fought valiantly to keep it on the air. Now all 18 episodes have been released in this long-awaited boxed set, which allows longtime fans and first-timers alike to enjoy one of television's most poignant and funny programs about high school.Created by writer-comedian Paul Feig and executive produced by Judd Apatow (The Larry Sanders Show),Freaks and Geeksfollowed the Weir siblings--former math whiz Lindsay (Linda Cardellini of theScooby-Doofeature films andER) and her younger brother Sam (John Francis Daley)--as they navigated the perils and pleasures of a Michigan high school circa 1980. What separatedFreaks and Geeksfrom most other scholastic series was its brutal honesty--Lindsay and Sam, as well as their friends and parents, were given very human personas that showed failure, malice, indecision, and moments of great clarity. Likewise, the plotlines rarely offered pat solutions to the characters' conflicts--the show unfolded in a naturalistic manner, which was a welcome respite for viewers tired of flashy high school dramas. When combined with its smart dialogue and winning performances (the cast includedSCTVveteran Joe Flaherty andSpider-Manstar James Franco, as well as the sublime and criminally underrecognized Martin Starr and Seth Rogen as Sam's pal Bill and dry-witted Ken, respectively), the show became a haven for fans of quality television, if only for a brief period of time.The six-disc boxed set provides over 40 hours of supplemental material, which should satiate even the most obsessive of fans.

{"description": "Thirty Helens agree:The Kids in the Hallis a funny show. (Mr. Tyzik, the bitter Head Crusher, however, may not agree.) The no-holds-barred sketch comedy is also strange, silly, profane--occasionally even profound. The five Canadian writer-comedians behind it, Dave Foley (NewsRadio), Bruce McCulloch (Superstar), Kevin McDonald (That ''70s Show), Mark McKinney (Saturday Night Live), and Scott Thompson (The Larry Sanders Show), formed the troupe in the early 1980s. Naturally, they weren't really kids, but boyish-looking men in their twenties and thirties.SNL's Lorne Michaels produced the series, which lasted for five seasons, and aired on HBO, Comedy Central, and Canada's CBC. It garnered three Emmy nominations and was followed by the theatrical cult classicThe Kids in the Hall: Brain Candy(1996) and several tours.The Toronto-based team took more inspiration from the absurdity ofMonty Python--and the craziness inherent in everyday life--than the topical humor ofSNL(on which celebrities, politicians, and pop culture are frequent targets). Each 30-minute installment features short, punchy skits (some filmed in advance, some before a live audience), men in drag, and no special guest hosts or stars (musical or otherwise). During their small-screen rein, the Kids took aim at everything from mainstream comedy and corporate culture to sexism, bigotry, and pretension. Many of their best-loved characters first appeared during the 20 episodes produced between 1989-1990. They include the 30 Helens (30 Helens standing in a field agreeing about something or other), Tyzik (McKinney), rockin' Bobby (McCulloch), bickering Fran and Gordon (Thompson and McCulloch), chatty Cathy and Kathie (McCulloch and Thompson), the \"Nobody Likes Us\" guys (Foley and MacDonald), and the acerbic Buddy Cole (Thompson).Canadian underground heroes Shadowy Men on a Shadowy Planet provided the icing on their spicy little cake with their wistful surf-rock theme \"Having an Average Weekend.\"--Kathleen C.

{"description": "The turbulent lives of two handsome and high-priced Miami plastic surgeons may be one of the more unusual premises for a television series, but the FX Channel'sNip/Tuckcombines sudsy sex and biting wit with the emotional quandaries involved in body modification in a way that makes for an engrossing--and occasionally gross--hourlong drama. The show benefits greatly from its two leads--Dylan Walsh as the troubled \"good\" surgeon and Julian McMahon as his predatory (but equally troubled) \"bad\" partner--as well as Joely Richardson as Walsh's wife and Roma Maffia as the surgeons' nurse. IfNip/Tuckdoes have a stumbling point, it's in its occasionally glib dialogue (series creator Ryan Murphy was a writer for the verbally flashy high school seriesPopular), which can clash with an episode's more dramatic and poignant moments. The show also doesn't shy away from showing the more gruesome aspects of plastic surgery, but viewers can often see more stomach-churning images on the top-ratedCSI. But the strength of the performances and the originality of the premise make these rough spots manageable for viewers looking for an interesting spin on the usual \"doctor show.\" The five-DVD set offers an extended version of the pilot and all 12 episodes of the first season as well as a trio of documentaries (one on the show itself, another on its special effects, and a third, \"Realistic Expectations,\" on real-life plastic surgeons). A gag reel (amusingly titled \"Severed Parts\"), a selection of deleted scenes for most episodes, and a music video for the title theme (\"A Perfect Lie\" by the Engine Room) round out the box.--Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0009IW88K", "B000FUTVLO", "B000QUTTPG", "B0013FSL16", "B003CN5SAY", "B001PQZYQI", "B000QUTTPQ", "1419811118", "B00079FUI6", "B0008JIJ1A", "B001QE99AQ", "B000ENUYGI", "B000OIOOVE", "B000Q6GUKW", "B00166647K", "B00HT851LO", "B000FFJYE8", "B00005JO9J", "B000FIMG4U", "B000FVQLIO", "B000FIMG5Y", "B00008AOX3", "B000QUTTQ0", "B00005JNOG", "B000FIMG68", "B00JF5GAZA", "B002WQ799U", "B000QDLSR0", "B0018CWEZI", "B000P6YNTI", "B0012CJQY6", "B00166UFSY", "B0024FAR5M", "B0036TGTF2", "B000P6YNSE", "B0012CJQYG", "B000FKO3GW", "B00005JPII", "B001AQBGM4", "B000P6YNSO", "B001FB4W0W", "B0007QS324", "B000V86OKG", "B001B7CNZ6", "B002N5N5QQ", "B000YABIQ6", "B000FUTVPA", "B0002RQ3MK", "B000NDEXK2", "B000Q6GUW0", "B001B7N4WM", "B002WQ79A4", "B0018CWEYY", "B000YW8RPE", "B003L77GRO", "B0015ABRE2", "B000R9YLKY", "B00005JNEQ", "B001VPJYZK", "B0012CJQZA", "B0002V7TZQ", "B0012CJQZ0", "B003F3NDP8", "B001LM64UG", "B0002MPQRS", "B0012CJQYQ", "B0018CWEYO", "B0000E5NPY", "B000R7HRRA", "B0011NVCAM", "B0002234R2", "B001ILFUAA", "B003CPPY5G", "B000P12LWY", "B00004RFCM", "B001MVWRNE", "B00IYMSMTM", "B000RW3VDE", "B002GHHHL0", "B002AMVED8", "B000E3L7F0", "B00168ML34", "B0055SNHQG", "B000FS9MY2", "B0013ZGN9I", "B00009Y3RW", "B005FISBTO", "B0006IUE16", "B000HT3P6U", "B0009K7QZ8", "B000G1R4TS", "B000JLTRJK", "B008H6GHF6", "B000B8IA08", "B00005JMMT", "B003LXM1PK", "B001CY5N1E", "B002N5N5M0", "B000MGBSI0", "B000G6BL88"], "bought_together": ["B0009IW88K", "B000FUTVLO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000QUTTPG", "B001PQZYQI", "B0013FSL16", "B003XWEQ8E"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 11266}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 12.99, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B0001O3YLM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51%2B5PfPHCXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Nip/Tuck: Season 1"}

{"description": "Hayao Miyazaki gained widespread attention in Japan for his complex ecological manga series,Nausica&#xE4; of the Valley of the Wind(1982), which he adapted for the screen two years later. One thousand years after a war devastated much of the Earth, humanity clings to existence at the fringes of a vast, polluted forest inhabited by monstrous insects. Only Nausica&#xE4;, the princess of the tiny realm of the Valley of the Wind, grasps the environmental significance of the forest. She sees beyond petty wars and national rivalries to the only viable future for the planet. InNausica&#xE4;, Miyazaki began to explore elements he would develop more fully in his later films: daring, compassionate heroines; exciting flying sequences; colorful side characters; strong interpersonal relationships; and a call for an ecologically sustainable way of life. Nausica&#xE4; prefigures Sheeta inCastle in the Skyand Chihiro inSpirited Away, just as the rough and ready Asbel anticipates Pazu inCastle in the Skyand Ashitaka inPrincess Mononoke. For years,Nausica&#xE4;was available in the United States only as the badly re-editedWarriors of the Wind. The new English dub from Disney presents the film in its entirety, with strong vocal performances by Uma Thurman, Patrick Stewart, Alison Lohman, and Edward James Olmos.

{"description": "\"Keep it real\" says Ali G (Sacha Baron Cohen) at the top of each show. Keeping it real is what the British comedian does--and doesn't do--during each episode. First, there's the character of Ali G himself. There's nothing real about this slang-slinging geezer. He's a poser, a white hip-hop wannabe from the 'burbs who aspires to be \"gangsta\" like Biggie and Tupac. His interview subjects, on the other hand, are the real deal: Newt Gingrich, Buzz Aldrin, Donald Trump, etc. Ali asks stupid questions, they attempt to provide intelligent answers. The humor comes from the disconnect between the two, which is to say:60 MinutesmeetsIn Living Color.Da Ali G Showwas a hit in Britain before Cohen brought his act to the States, but Ali wasn't the only character who came with him. There's also Borat, a Kazakhstan TV reporter with a shaky command of English. His show-within-a-show is called \"Borat's Guide to America\" and he travels the \"US and A\" interviewing regular folks, such as matchmakers and rodeo riders. Then there's Bruno, a sexually ambiguous fashion reporter with \"Funkyzeit Mit Bruno.\" His subjects include models and designers. Borat and Bruno have their moments, but Ali G is the star of the show and gets the most screen time. It's Ali G, after all, who gets both James Lipton and Ralph Nader to rap. (The verdict? Lipton's got skills; Nader should stick to politics.) As proof of his popularity in the U.K., Ali G got his own theatrical release,Ali G Indahousein 2002. As proof of his popularity in the U.S., HBO renewed his show for a second season. Due to sexual content, raunchy humor, and drug content,Da Ali G Showis recommended for mature audiences.--Kathleen C.

{"description": "This is PAL VIDEO FORMAT (not NTSC and will not play in regular American DVD-player) and an only official release of Larry Clark's \"Ken Park\" movie on DVD over the world by Russian company \"CP Digital\". Larry Clark's Ken Park has sent ripples with explicit scenes, and acts, overshadowing other movies on display. The story of four dysfunctional families in the skateboarding hotbed of Visalia, Calif., unspooled in the experimental Upstream competition. \"But I didn't want to cut a single frame,\" the cult film director and photographer told. \"All my life I've seen the camera turn away, but these scenes are part of the reality ... of this generation.\" The film was co-directed by Clark - who made the controversial 1995 movie \"Kids\", renowned cinematographer Ed Lachman, who shot Steven Soderbergh's award-winning \"Erin Brockovich\" and Todd Haynes' \"Far From Heaven\". The movie features violence involving not only the restless teenagers in the small town, but also their parents. But Clark says the film is an \"uplifting\" look at modern youth that shows some of the kids overcoming the odds...\"My first film Kids was about the secret world of children, where parents are not allowed. In Ken Park we go inside the houses of four families and meet the parents. Ken Park is the story of children and their parents in Visalia, California, an isolated inland town between Los Angeles and Fresno. The story flows through the lives of three young boys and one girl, all childhood friends, and their parents. The children's and parents' lives are unmasked and you see the ascent of violence, sex, hatred, love and the manic episodes of emotional confusion.\" - Larry Clark", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000BGH29K", "B003B2UK1S", "B000L6S92E", "B00005U14H", "B00003JRAV", "B000LAZDQA", "B00C8CQ5SO", "B003XKNGNW", "B00023P4I8", "B00EOBB7LC", "B0015FHDWM", "B000059HA5", "B0076ANKUY", "B00INUK5WM", "B00GRZPRB4", "B000FZEQCS", "B00AYGVCCK", "B004GBMVTW", "B0009VRHLK", "B00KHWP9FC", "B00368PSNC", "B000FDE5CQ", "B00APUAKYG", "B00BJSLNN0", "B0007TZHWA", "B0009WDVUK", "B000H7JADY", "B000RJEI84", "B0002JZT5A", "B00JVQ7QTM", "B00A7WHL08", "B002R3CQDC", "B00AKLLSNC", "B00GGY4R3K", "B00009W0U4", "B0020LH8WU", "B00GPPXNIK", "B005DU58QS", "B00AZAJXOE", "B0000BWVD9", "B000F0UUD2", "B0046WCM7M", "B00F2RNAUI", "B00B022GVS", "B000U95N9E", "B000066S26", "B00JVQ7PWU", "B006M3M5FM", "B00GHP8SH4", "B00AY6PK5A", "B00IA7MFEO", "B00005JMIJ", "B000SKU04S", "B00D1BODEY", "B0042FUHSY", "B001MEJY8W", "B001EHDMW6", "B009L79YRI", "B00FB349R6", "B001TR4G7G", "B000EZ8ZRG", "B00000IBL1", "B000AYELEC", "B000059XTM", "B00KU3YIW8", "B005GWKUC0", "B001DJ7PQY", "B002T4GY4Q", "B000PKG8TM", "B00EOYK616", "B004YMATCY", "B001F114IA", "B00HLP5APW", "B00005K9O8", "B004SEUJEG", "B00I4CWIVU", "B0031DRZEC", "B00GXHO03C", "B000WMFZRO", "B00006RCN8", "B005IGVTM4", "B005BCE75G", "B00177Y9TS", "B004BE436I", "B008JFX04G", "B004QJOE44", "B00I567EWS", "B001CIOCNK", "B00B0LL0E8", "1590213289", "B00B0LKUKI", "B00I2U91Z0", "B0004Z32NI", "B004EBT81I", "B00HLTYRUM", "B000UW8596", "B008XEZXV6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000BGH29K", "B003XKNGNW", "B00004YA6G", "B00003JRAV"]}, "price": 26.59, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 180513}, "asin": "B000298WFE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Z1TXXECPL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Ken Park (Uncut Uncensored Director's Version - Import)"}

{"description": "With dry humor, the mockumentaryShowboyturns a portrait in  self-delusion into the pursuit of a dream. A British documentarian wants  to make a short movie about Christian Taylor, a writer on the cable seriesSix Feet Under--only she arrives just as Christian is abruptly  fired while the show is shooting in Las Vegas. Humiliated and depressed,  Christian stays in Vegas and starts pursuing jobs as a chorus boy; he  tells the documentarian that he's doing research for a screenplay.Showboyplays its cards very close to the chest; the agents, dance  teachers, and casting directors that Christian meets with could well be  genuine--the deadpan performances never wink at the camera. The humor  springs from a mixture of embarrassing awkwardness and the fundamental  absurdity of life in Las Vegas. With cameos by Whoopi Goldberg, Siegfried  and Roy, and Alan Ball (creator ofSix Feet Under).--Bret  Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00GSA3K6C", "B00GHP8SH4", "B000F6II1M", "B004PQBYVE", "B005GM38MO", "B005OUL7OY", "B00004XMT7", "1884190618", "B00008YLU4", "B005TIK4SQ", "B0006J28C8", "B00013WVI0", "B00FYL08RK", "B00EU8RB14", "B0002IQJ5U", "B00008AOTW", "6305415315", "B00F98FOPE", "B00005LQ0D", "B00008UALE", "B000MGBM2C", "B00ADU287U", "B00DUJH94S", "B003IG06PM", "B00B4MMQJ6", "B001KF6F8U", "B004RIACU4", "B000NVT0UM", "B00006ADD6", "B000AYQO74", "B0000B1A36", "B000KRN2KI", "B0009OL894", "B0038M61J6", "B0000DD75N", "B000EMG93Q", "B005N1TKQQ", "B00FN93T6U", "B000VLLYFI", "B0030GBSV6", "B000068TP5", "B000AYELCO", "B000JSI7F8", "B001AOC9K4", "B005Y2HXAY", "B001OSC4BA", "B00153CLNK", "B00064AFEG", "B002PCVLX6", "B0010YSD4K", "B000UNYJOK", "B0002ZDWA8", "B00005UF80", "B000W1USIQ", "B0001BMMHW", "B003VADSKA", "B00004YKR4", "B001608MGC", "B000CR7R7K", "B003VE9WPG", "B000KGGILE", "B00097E70I", "B001CT05N0", "B000FDE5DA", "B00D1BODEY", "B000ARXG7W", "B00316DDZY", "B001NGNLO2", "B0007XG1BM", "B002Y3GZD2", "B000228T40", "B0000DD75T", "6305760977", "B000LSAJ0M", "B000OVLBHQ", "B00092ZLK8", "B002M2T1U4", "B005LZW994", "B0002QO1MK", "B000HC2M16", "B0036FLDQG", "B000MX7UGM", "B00009AV9E", "B00005ASPF", "B001O2UTRC", "B00COBWXIK", "B0009WFETG", "B002SAMMLK", "B00006ADF5", "B000FTJ74Q", "B000056BPH", "B000E0WJUK", "B005XGJW50", "B001UDPAAG", "B00004UE8W"], "bought_together": ["B000NVT0UM"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00ADU287U", "B000CR7R7K", "B0042KZJFA", "B0062QHZJU"]}, "price": 17.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 298887}, "asin": "B0002B15OM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51MPWSK3NEL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Showboy"}

{"description": "Those who have enjoyed this program on PBS need only   be told that it is available on home video. Andr&#xE9; Rieu is a   master of light classical music, and here he is at his best.   The program was taped live, outdoors in the Piazza de la  Republica in the Italian cty of Cortona. Rieu addresses the  audience in fluent but sometimes charmingly awkward Italian, with English subtitles. From the opening moments  he has the vast crowd in the palm of his hand. They whistle  for him in \"Chanson d'amour,\" clap in unison for the \"Toreador  Song\" fromCarmen, the \"Radetzky\" march, and the galloping  finales of theWilliam TellandLight Cavalryovertures,  and sing along in \"La donna e mobile,\" the drinking song fromLa traviata, and, most movingly, the Italian national anthem  and \"Va pensiero,\" which is almost a national anthem.The music is basic classical top-40, with an emphasis on opera  and a lot of Italian music, including \"The Carnival of Venice\"  and the Grand March fromAida. The performances are full  of energy and technically skilled. Rieu conducts, plays his violin,  and generously shares the spotlight, notably with soprano Carmen Monarca, mezzo-soprano Carla Malfioletti, and several singing and  dancing young ladies who might have stepped out of a Botticelli  painting. Visuals include, besides the concert, a charming Tuscan  landscape and a ride in a Venetian gondola.--Joe McLellan", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0019OP0LA", "B0000CNY5X", "B000S6M1YO", "B000H0MNIU", "B00417HUVK", "B00006RCNJ", "B00561A1UM", "B00F8RP898", "B007Q0K9TE", "B00BQ1D7WK", "B008SGW5FG", "B005VGMYZM", "B000I2J7YA", "B00CUHMUZ4", "B002NGD902", "B004ZWW35O", "B00006RCNI", "B000BF0DS8", "B0000844KW", "B0012IXBKA", "B000AYEI5O", "B0049PBOLQ", "B00F6EJG2S", "B0001HAGPG", "B003MB9SH0", "B0000844KY", "B0006U3U6K", "B0038QAVPC", "B0036833SY", "B00B1952SO", "B004J7CPHG", "B002M25VFI", "B0002OOV4A", "B0001LYG76", "B003I4VL1W", "B001MM4ANI", "B003FVCZ4K", "B008SGW59M", "B000PSP9AI", "B001HQZKVU", "B008SGW53I", "B0000069D1", "B000S6M1YE", "B0031P6XV6", "B0001WXX60", "6304493703", "B003I4EJM0", "B005CA55O4", "B00I3SVZXM", "B000T2PRFW", "B00000I076", "B0062WR80U", "B00006LSPB", "B0045DDNPC", "B001IFVL0E", "B00000411X", "B002CUYM1O", "B005X5XIL0", "B007Q0K9ZI", "B000UNYK7G", "B002DAJ8GW", "B001MM4AO2", "B000031WXB", "B00BZC0AFW", "B0000CABHH", "B0010YPTGU", "B00AO7HNMW", "B0024RIMBG", "B000VD3Q2A", "B00B1952TS", "B000I2J6R8", "B000X1L816", "B000KLNLNM", "B002K3GOUA", "B00FAZ01JU", "B007146EEY", "B000JCEU50", "B00AGMTA62", "B005GRTNVE", "B0000041OB", "B003143G08", "B000I2J7Y0", "B000G8NY4U", "B009PDO946", "B00EPFEY44", "B000R5NZ2S", "B00EZRY62C", "5558147792", "B001DR23M2", "B00B5UBDA0", "B004RUE7JO", "B000Y7ZHCU", "6305781427", "B003JLL2RW", "B0007P0LPC", "B00000JP87", "B0006OG572", "B00HF95OMI", "B000JJSRNY"], "bought_together": ["B0019OP0LA", "B000S6M1YO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000S6M1YO", "B0019OP0LA", "B00417HUVK", "B00561A1UM"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 22296}, "categories": [["CDs & Vinyl", "Classical"], ["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 16.9, "brand": "", "asin": "B0002OOQMW", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41YDoWlnWwL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Andre Rieu - Tuscany"}

Trouble is, Jon is clueless about how to cook a big bird; fortunately, starving Garfield has the good sense to call in Jon's spirited grandmother for a culinary rescue. Grandma shows up, too, in \"A Garfield Christmas,\" about a family get-together that covers all the nice holiday stuff and, of course, lots of bickering, pouting, and jealousy. As long as Garfield gets his Yuletide lasagna, however, all is right with the world.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0006GAOKO", "B00020HA9C", "B00009WHRM", "B001CO32FI", "B0007PAM3I", "B0089BSLWG", "B000A9QKU0", "B003NLE5HC", "B0029ZUQB2", "B0002XVQSK", "B000B7QCR2", "B000244EK6", "B0009NZ2TM", "B00004R99Y", "B003U0AHG4", "B0009OUB06", "B004ZKKKXS", "B0007IO71S", "B00005K9OE", "B002JUFPUE", "B000GBEWR0", "B002WCLG34", "B0019KAQEU", "B00465I174", "B000S6LP5A", "B0009OUAZW", "B000HC2LH6", "B0077PTX3G", "B000UZDO6M", "B005R2SI1E", "B00DGWZKHM", "B001CO42J8", "B0000ALPIW", "B000N2HDJ6", "B0000C52I4", "B0002IQASG", "B0057FGCJQ", "B0006IIOIQ", "B003VMFX4W", "6301752686", "6305950547", "B000068MBV", "B000ICM5KS", "B0002I82Z0", "B001CO42IO", "B00936A12O", "B005BXY1QK", "B0010KP374", "B000EWBNPK", "B00DZP1BKK", "6305756430", "B000EWBKO4", "B005ENCIXU", "B0081NAUJY", "B004IF4EYG", "B000096IAI", "B00000JZHM", "B0009OUB2O", "B009P3J61C", "B00009YXHJ", "B005DKS1US", "B0002T2QRY", "B0010DM4EG", "B001N6FPQY", "B00DNF1S0K", "B000R7G6JA", "B002VA5A16", "B003NFM3JK", "B008UY8FI2", "B00008DDVY", "B00005OSJR", "0345464656", "B005SQRYP0", "B000068TPP", "B009JE18UE", "B0002M5U7E", "B00BCMT1PK", "B001E2PQA2", "B00004VVP9", "B001U3N3QY", "B003YCIE68", "6305428042", "B000NJMJGG", "0345524209", "B00005NB93", "B000AYEIZ4", "B00EQ30Q8S", "B00B1Z6MB4", "B001VFM0TW", "0345330455", "B0006Z2LH4", "6303816339", "B000E1NXCW", "B002ZFEQ4E", "0345525973", "B000ATQYT2", "B00003CXCT", "B000M2E3FO"], "bought_together": ["B001CO32FI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0089BSLWG", "B00009WHRM", "B001CO32FI", "B002JUFPUE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 20704}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 61.59, "brand": "Garfield", "asin": "B0002PYS74", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51VJ0E69ERL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Garfield: Holiday Celebrations (Garfield's Halloween Adventure / Garfield's Thanksgiving / A Garfield Christmas)"}

{"description": "Black Sun is an uncompromising portrayal of the war crimes perpetrated by the Japanese Imperial Army upon the Chinese military and civilian population of Nanking during the occupation of the city. Hailed by critics as one of the most disturbing films ever released. Black Sun: The Nanking Massacre is unflinching in its depiction of the barbaric cruelty with which the occupying army raped, pillaged and terrorized the defeated populace.  Black Sun: The Nanking Massacre is so audacious in its insistence of factual representation this it refuses to be categorized. The film embraces myriad genres- war, drama, horror, documentary, exploitation, even propaganda. This unyielding film chronicles events so atrocious that, over sixty years after their occurrence, many in Japan still cannot bring themselves to admit the horror that their nation unleashed on their Chinese Neighbors.  From the acclaimed Chinese director T. F. Mou (Men Behind the Sun), Black Sun: The Nanking Massacre portrays the ordeals of the members of a poor Chinese Family as they try to survive the Japanese occupation of their city. Two young children, Jean and John, escape with their uncle after witnessing the gruesome murder of their mother and father by Japanese Soldiers. While fleeing from the Japanese, they are separated and the children have to fend for themselves in the war torn city. The film lays bare the pitiless conduct of the Japanese army commanders as they attempt to subjugate the city by any means possible in order to further the cause of the Japanese domination of China and their pursuit of a Greater Asia under Japanese rule. Unearthed Films is proud to release this landmark film in its entirety. The film is presented in an uncut anamorphic transfer from the original negative and the DVD includes numerous supplemental materials to help understand the historical context of the events that occurred.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000AQS1H", "B000ZN71GS", "B005E2YL3Q", "B003PMWF62", "B007WXUVHU", "B001KEHAEE", "B003EYEEI8", "0465068367", "B001B187L6", "B001MEJY8W", "0804835659", "B0018ZOARK", "B00GGY4R3K", "B0000BWVCR", "1602391459", "B003VL3UR0", "B005DKS1TE", "B003OXGW5M", "B00BC1UPRO", "B00IVLR9JA", "B007S0DCUU", "B004TXFFI6", "B001BEK8FQ", "B006OT0UUQ", "B000AQ69QI", "B000WC38EQ", "B0085X31KK", "B006UGWDXU", "0465068359", "B0049TC8CQ", "B00EOBB7LC", "B00005O5D0", "B00C6QT4CQ", "B000OPPAEM", "B00097DY5M", "B000FDFSYA", "B004BLTNM0", "B000087EYX", "B00005U8F4", "B004XWHU0E", "B00CMDPTPY", "B001CU7W5I", "B00005AVZU", "B00009W0U4", "B002NN7EY2", "B001DWNUCO", "B000U95N9E", "B001D5C1OO", "B0008KLVA0", "B00004TJM8", "B002QP145C", "B000YKT4BW", "B00CVB6UXW", "B00CC2V792", "1605983578", "0375701974", "B00D3XMA9A", "B00005YUO1", "B004AZ7ZLI", "B005E2YL3G", "B004HHX9XC", "B004LOUD80", "B00668IE3U", "B0041H55H6", "B000NQ28OW", "B000777JH8", "B000HXDWNM", "B0076XTIWU", "B00005JM23", "B0001IXSZ0", "B004IFYMYI", "B00096S444", "B005SQRYB4", "B0082SIGR6", "B00ARWXJ54", "B00C2535TE", "B003WKL6XA", "B0014VPFVS", "B0086IMNHQ", "B005QBST1U", "B0015D20FE", "B009NZXH5S", "B0016Q1KRO", "0472086626", "B00000IC9C", "B00267S502", "B0000A2ZNX", "B000JJSJ9G", "B0026KWTSI", "B00007H24I", "B0000648Z7", "B0096TXMO2", "B000QTD02U", "B001IYAJG2"], "bought_together": ["B0000AQS1H", "B005E2YL3Q"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005E2YL3Q", "B0000AQS1H", "0465068367", "B007WXUVHU"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 145283}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 18.95, "brand": "", "asin": "B0002YCV4M", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51i0SDL4nRL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Black Sun: The Nanking Massacre"}

{"description": "In 1974 the New York City music scene was shocked into consiousness by a band of misfits from Queens called the Ramones. Playing in seedy Bowery bar to a small group of fellow struggling musicians, the band struck a chord of disharmony that rocked the foundation of the '70s music scene. Tracing the history of the band, from its unlikely origins through its star-crossed career, bitter demise and the sad fates of Joey and Dee Dee, End of the Century is a vibrant, candid document of one of the most influential groups in the history of rock.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0002NY7UO", "B0035CVB1W", "B000EGEVZK", "B00003CXHM", "B000063UQN", "B001DHXSXU", "B00005JGAC", "081099660X", "B00005JGAH", "B0000691TJ", "B0017WI5W0", "1847721036", "1844494136", "B00005JGAF", "B0000691TI", "B000002LCT", "1439159750", "B00000JFUY", "B00IPL28QU", "1560252529", "B001ET081W", "B0000691TG", "B00EV2P0T4", "B000002LDX", "B0035CVB26", "B0002BK9J4", "B0000691TH", "B0008G2748", "B007R3B4RG", "B004GGU9QE", "B000002L9O", "B001BTODPM", "B000003BRA", "B00005JGAB", "B000002N2N", "0802142648", "0061958352", "B00068CMIO", "0743252160", "B0002NRS0U", "B00E4V0BG4", "1597776122", "B0002BK9JE", "B000EXZI0A", "B000P0J060", "B000BKDNWG", "B00004ZBVO", "B0035CVB2G", "B000077VQC", "B00465I1B0", "B00J7YBR4S", "B000001FMX", "B00J587J9I", "B00JPXAO5E", "B000002LQ1", "B000E97HUS", "B0000AKY5W", "B00CPTUMO8", "B00JFBCDD2", "B00JPXAOW2", "B00K6D1FZU", "B00F3TDA2I", "B0091JJ24Q", "B00JZ4XBVC", "B000A0GP4K", "B001NHZ2KM", "1606710206", "B000F4TMH8", "B0006IIKS0", "B00026L93Y", "B00IOODR6I", "B000E0OEVW", "B00009PJSX", "B00BCMT0AQ", "B00006LEQZ", "B009ES41TK", "B002WJHBEU", "B0000DJZ81", "0670025631", "1780385404", "B0009CTUPA", "B002DY9KQG", "B00004BZ09", "B005IGVTHE", "0062114042", "B00008G3FW", "B00ITB97O2", "B00IXHBL7I", "B0001CCXHA", "B000003BRN", "B000002LPK", "B00GO2OOQO", "B00F3TD8QQ", "1560253045", "0711991081", "B0010WZTNA", "B000I5XD1U", "B000FMFZD0", "B000005JBF"], "bought_together": ["B0002NY7UO", "B0035CVB1W"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0035CVB1W", "B0002NY7UO", "B00005JGAB", "B000EGEVZK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 48083}, "categories": [["CDs & Vinyl", "Alternative Rock", "Hardcore & Punk", "American Punk"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Alternative Rock", "Hardcore & Punk", "Punk"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Pop", "Vocal Pop"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Rock"], ["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 12.55, "brand": "WEA DES Moines Video", "asin": "B000642JG8", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61CQ2NwmR4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "End of the Century - The Story of the Ramones"}

{"description": "Deliverancegoes to high school in this grim, stripped-down fable of a prank gone bad. Friends decide to teach a lesson to a teenage bully by inviting him on a canoeing trip where they will humiliate him once and for all. The prank turns seriously sour, and the kids must deal with the consequences. Writer-director Jacob Aaron Estes takes a somber look at these lives, although his low-key approach makes the central tragedy seem melodramatic when it happens. The film isn't quite new enough to be truly revelatory, but Estes neatly avoids aRiver's Edgerehash by allowing his characters more than dead-eyed anomie. The actors hit their notes with precision, especially Rory Culkin (another of the Culkin family, with Macaulay and Kieran), Ryan Kelley, and Scott Mechlowicz. This is the kind of movie that may be slightly familiar to older audiences, but could easily be a home-video cult item with younger viewers.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0007NFLO0", "B0007R4TJ4", "B0002I8372", "B00IKM5OCO", "B0007Y08QA", "B00DUX290S", "0783233507", "B000F6II1M", "B0001EFUFK", "B00006JMQ4", "B009SFR2QI", "B000NO39FG", "B00G3DA5XA", "B0042FDCMC", "B005PTMPYA", "B00HUQCA28", "B008NNY8RM", "B000031EFY", "B000GI3KGC", "B00005U14H", "B00HQI811Y", "B001J9KJ48", "B00EOBB7LC", "B00DL46ZN8", "B00CBFB8SU", "B00657PLN8", "B0002VOY40", "B000PAAJZ6", "B000FVQM2Y", "B001KEGRBQ", "B00005RHGK", "B00013RC7K", "B000RGN2JI", "B002PI1NRO", "B00AEFYV9W", "B004PP3ICS", "B000CS464G", "B000059HA5", "B009OCR2U6", "B00BEIYG98", "B00000G02H", "B003EYVXTG", "B0009W5IQ0", "B00BTYPW7C", "B0000AOX0D", "B000077VRT", "B008ZQ4W64", "B000N3AW6G", "B002FP1426", "B005GT3XC2", "B0007GP6ZG", "B003Y5H4W0", "B004LXBKEC", "B00AEFXHNI", "B0064SVNAI", "B0000639HQ", "0792840127", "B00004ZBVO", "B0009R1TI6", "B00C7BZZ32", "B006KH6CF4", "B000WC38EQ", "B00187FPC2", "B000U1ZV76", "B003ASLJQS", "B0021L8UYY", "B000BX8R1A", "B0082CWTSY", "B00177YA6U", "B004O8OLO0", "B0054602PS", "B000053VAX", "B0009X75EC", "B004LWZW2O", "B009AMAGQM", "B000099T3J", "B0058ZPNOK", "B00AEFYCL4", "B000ZM1MGE", "B00003CXQA", "B0001KL5DA", "B000XUUQRE", "B00BTYJYR6", "B00D2UMHVK", "B000QEIOSU", "B0046WCM7M", "B009POCG0Y", "B00005Y4RY", "B007CO5E30", "B008G1JIQC", "B00005JL7Q", "B008NNY8O0", "B0013FW05Y", "B004FQX59S", "B000R4SMCW", "0767835093", "B001NPD9PY", "B002KQD66C", "B00007JXWX", "B000BBOUUE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001J9KJ48", "B0007NFLO0", "B000GI3KGC"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 129750}, "asin": "B0006IUDTY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/511RNWSTM9L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Mean Creek"}
{"description": "Island at Warturns a little-known bit of history into an  extraordinarily rich miniseries. During World War II, the Nazi forces  occupied the Channel Islands, located between France and England.Island at Warunfolds on the fictional island of St. Gregory, where  a web of interconnected characters cope with the occupation--a politician  struggles to maintain peaceful relations, for fear of brutal reprisals; an island policeman's anger at the occupation becomes complicated  when he's forced to chauffeur the commanding Nazi officer and he discovers  the position gives his family privilege; a shopkeeper, angry about her husband's death in an  early bombing raid, finds herself sharing in profits with a Nazi official  as they bring much-wanted food and supplies to the island; a girl hiding  her Jewish identity becomes the object of a brutal lieutenant's sexual  obsession. These four stories are only a hint of the series' fullness; the  script, direction, and performances are superb, building an engrossing  portrait of how human beings cope with extremity and how the smallest of  interactions--from laying rocks on a wall to getting a photograph  developed--can lead to profound and unexpected results. The economy and  complexity of Stephen Mallatratt's script are remarkable. The forces of  money, sex, prejudice, and love run deep through every story, juxtaposing  private moments with historical scope.Island at Warmatches skill  and talent with passion and insight.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0046MOVEO", "B001JXPC8C", "B0007LFPJ8", "B008N8A40C", "B000GYI3D6", "B00HUAGYF8", "B000QXDCWY", "B00720ONOK", "B00H4ZEFTQ", "B009DS6YGO", "B003YOZNC4", "B0051O0NE8", "B004WMOSLE", "B00LG7VVPO", "B0039ZF8KA", "B0013NAMLK", "B00HUAH14Q", "B00JJRLFTU", "B002V3AM4S", "B002Y06VE8", "B00IBKXQJS", "B00ANGICCO", "B00BCXW106", "B00E3UN66I", "B004JMSIQS", "B0010S6EQK", "B00FPPQYXM", "B002AMUDJY", "B00ECXJC1E", "B008UQUS26", "B0083HXKMC", "B003CP1T50", "B0047CG9D4", "B00B62R9XM", "B00B5A9FNM", "B00AQYUY5Q", "B0074FUSFG", "B00F1BFRA6", "B009L2EW5W", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B0038M2SAW", "B00BOTCJXC", "B00D49YEHO", "B004H0ZHD4", "B0093I913W", "B0083HXKAY", "B00DW5ILF6", "B00429MLZC", "B007ISJS1O", "B00GWXI1F0", "B0011VJRVU", "B00JJRLFVS", "B009DS3VQA", "B008RO6PJQ", "B002CWKTUA", "B00DL48BM6", "B00EKFI1HA", "B0090XUARQ", "B00A8KJLPM", "B000KJTG0G", "B00GAXASK8", "B00HGE90Z4", "B006MK6Y8Y", "B007TSV4IS", "B001FBPSW8", "B00EF0NVGQ", "B00H4BHIGW", "B00GWXI20E", "B0007GP83G", "B00GUERO6I", "B00BIR2A3E", "B007T40GOK", "B000HC2PLS", "B00D49YBTA", "B00GSBMNOQ", "B00ID8H8EW", "B00DC5K1FO", "B00A27O5AW", "B00006IUHL", "B00IBKXP8A", "B00BEZEDNU", "B00G15MDI0", "B0066E6RLK", "B00J3M54AW", "B00BDSRM4K", "B0002XVS6A", "B00A8KJMP6", "B005G492E0", "B00C888LOO", "B00C12ZISE", "B0080QOL10", "B005GP7EVC", "B00A27O0N4", "B005MXQD4W", "B0001NBNGQ", "B0001WTUK8", "B00GHH9I62", "B00IJS2OHM"], "bought_together": ["B0046MOVEO", "B001JXPC8C"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0046MOVEO", "B0007LFPJ8", "B001JXPC8C", "B002Y06VE8"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 25067}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 40.78, "brand": "Acorn Media", "asin": "B0006Q93F6", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/513VE7AXHML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Island at War"}

Confused about her loyalties, poor Kate alternately runs to and from best friend Ryan (Jesse Bradford), who wants to become her lover, while Alice--super-critical of Lucy's sexuality--fails to keep secret her own fling with a nurse (Glenne Headly).Eulogynever quite reaches full boil, but there are many funny moments, and Deschanel, Romano, and Preston are particularly watchable.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0028S10YM", "B000F3UA66", "B00180OU70", "B001DWNUEM", "B004UXUWEC", "B000069HQ2", "B00009ZPTY", "B0000797IO", "B00E8G5HL4", "B0011KQSZ4", "6305801142", "B004UJN1XA", "B001CT05JE", "0767811097", "B001E95ZNS", "B00015HWX2", "B00BT76642", "B000EMGJAO", "B00006ADFN", "B0001ZX0HY", "B000E6ESL2", "B000CNESJO", "B00BNWWVFG", "B002VECMAO", "B003626TNG", "B0036TGT8Y", "B008B9JTLI", "B000IY0BIY", "B000WC38WS", "B001SN78JO", "B009EU72IA", "B000065K4K", "B0009GX1DI", "B002DQSKMY", "B0006TPE4C", "B00005JPD0", "B000286RP2", "B000M9CB4W", "0783229402", "B00006AUJR", "B0034G4OZE", "B000VY1EYG", "B0010X744G", "B005OK721G", "B00015HVV0", "B00BEIYMAG", "B005XB8T68", "B00AEFXR1K", "B00BG4R8SG", "B00005RYLX", "B000065V3G", "B0000C84O5", "B0018QPPXW", "B0009UVBSG", "B0009X75WE", "B0006TPDT8"], "bought_together": ["B0028S10YM", "B000F3UA66"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00180OU70", "B000F3UA66", "B004UXUWEC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 99571}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.82, "brand": "ROMANO,RAY", "asin": "B0006Z2LGU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Y9NJNB8GL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Eulogy"}
{"description": "Following the grisly 1997Cubeand its 2002 sequel,Cube 2: Hypercube,Cube Zerostretches the original'sThe Twilight Zone-like, strangers-in-a-box theme a little thin. Fortunately, there's a difference this time. The hero is not just another disoriented captive of the Cube's interconnected--often lethal--rooms, but rather a geek named Eric (Zachary Bennett) who sits in a control station wrestling with his conscience about inflicting misery on innocent people. Taking orders over the phone from some almighty, unknown power in a distant office, Eric reaches a breaking point and enters the maze himself, intent on helping a woman (Stephanie Moore) who doubts his motives. The existential bent of the prior films becomes even more Kafkaesque this time with the arrival of a white-collar team of tormentors, bureaucratic tyrants who can't or won't explain the point of the Cube. Imaginative writer-director Ernie Barbarash rescues what might have been a tedious formula flick.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00008DDVY", "6305238065", "B003TRMLQM", "B0051GLDQS", "B002EOVXEC", "0783228457", "B000CGX7FW", "B0056P6SOG", "B00J5LXT6M", "B008874968", "B004EPZ08O", "B00JF5GAIW", "B000A6T1ZY", "B0053TWVIM", "B002TVQ4HG", "B00006AUIG", "B002HML6YI", "B0007WQHI0", "B0000541TL", "B00AEFXW8I", "6305622760", "B0091G7BTM", "B000TGJ81W", "B002C6VMKW", "B000UJ48P4", "B002AMVEII", "B00006IUFV", "B001GCUO4S", "B00005O439", "B00J81S92S", "B00HRCATDW", "B001D5C1OO", "B0009MWELW", "B009B8YNGO", "078401213X", "6305972001", "B001J4E19C", "B001AGNMFI", "B0045HCJSU", "B00AZTUUQK", "B0009X76XC", "B000A2X3U2", "B0001US62I", "B006ZL1P66", "B002QW7ALM", "B00316DDUY", "B000MV8AC2", "B005OK722U", "B005CFBZQ6", "B000AC7OXY", "B00079Z9WI", "6305718954", "B00023P4SS", "B00699G622", "B0001EFV7M", "B000HEWEGC", "6305120021", "B0046BI81W", "B000HCO86I", "B0000D9PNG", "B00275EHFU", "B00ECW9UJY", "B00005JOWW", "B00JL6L4WC", "0767824954", "B000MV8ABS", "B00FYV7WCY", "B00EALTVPA", "B008Y1YK7G", "B009MO5FGY", "B000MNOX8U", "1573628174", "B008CYDD7I", "B0053TWVDC", "B003PIUINS", "B003TRMLM6", "B004W48KHK", "B001AIQ154", "B00005K3NZ", "B0000DC12T", "B008YAPR7E", "B00BEIYGT8", "B0007N1JC8", "B003Q6D27S", "B004AC6PMG", "B00A1AU74I", "B007NRBMZU", "B00003CXUP", "B00275EHGE", "B001MEJY8W", "B0031U8OEK", "B0042FDCKY", "B003L20IEC", "B00003CXKM", "B005J9ZFQG", "B003VA3JUO", "B000M341R8", "B000LPR9ZS", "B002EOVXCY"], "bought_together": ["B00008DDVY", "6305238065"], "buy_after_viewing": ["6305238065", "B00008DDVY", "B003TRMLQM", "B0040QYRSQ"]}, "price": 9.18, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 25723}, "asin": "B0006Z2LH4", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51H95J5QBCL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Cube Zero"}

{"description": "While 2003'sDaredevilwas a conventional superhero movie, the 2005 spinoff,Elektra, is more of awuxia-styled martial arts/fantasy flick. Elektra (Jennifer Garner) has returned to her life as a hired assassin, but she balks at an assignment to kill a single father (Goran Visnjic,ER) and his teenage daughter (Kirsten Prout). That makes her the target of the Hand, an organization of murderous ninjas, scheming corporate types, and a band of stylish supervillains seeking to eliminate Elektra and tip the balance of power in the ongoing battle of good vs. evil.As the star ofAlias, Garner has proven that she can kick butt with the best of them, and some of the visual effects are impressive, but the action sequences tend to be anticlimactic, and there's not much to the story. Fans will notice numerous references toFrank Miller's comic books, but there's very little resemblance to Miller's cold-blooded killer (Elektra with an agent? Elektra referring to herself as a \"soccer mom\"?).IsElektrabetter thanDaredevil? Not really, even with the distinct advantage of having all Garner and no Ben Affleck. That could be the spinoff's greatest disappointment: afterSpider-Man 2raised the bar for comic-book movies,Elektralowered it back toDaredevil's level.  Directed by Rob Bowman (theX-Filesmovie), and featuring Terence Stamp as the mysterious mentor Stick, Will Yun Lee (Die Another Day) as the chief villain, and NFL-player-turned-mixed-martial-arts-champion Bob Sapp as the immovable Stone.DVD featuresBen Affleck's much-rumored cameo is one of the deleted scenes on theElektraDVD.  It's a one-minute throwaway, and while he's supposedly appearing as Matt Murdock (who romanced Elektra inDaredevil), the barrage of celebrity gossip makes it impossible to see him as anything other than Jennifer Garner's real-life boyfriend.  There's also a making-of featurette, which is mostly promotional hype other than a few interesting effects shots; four editing featurettes; and Jennifer Garner's videotaped message to ComicCon.--David HoriuchiMore onElektraElektra: The Album(Soundtrack CD)Elektra: The Movie(Comic Adaptation)Frank Miller Comic BooksDaredevil(Director's Cut) (DVD)Jennifer Garner stars inAlias(DVD)More Superhero DVDs", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000959N0", "B000VI70QS", "B00005JNTU", "B0006L0LOS", "B000FGGE68", "B001QB9H1U", "B001CDR1FG", "B000OVLBF8", "B00AEFXCLU", "B0002IQMAM", "B005LAIGW8", "B001DHXT20", "B004EPZ07K", "B001F7MSFM", "B001GCUO1Q", "B0009A409S", "B008JFUS0U", "B002GSXKNI", "B00E5I2MEK", "B004LWZW42", "B0007V6ITE", "B000UR9T8C", "B001AK3S4Y", "B00K7IPFSM", "B00E5I2MCM", "078401132X", "B00E5I2M9K", "B00005JM5B", "B0090SI56Y", "B00005JKWJ", "B004LWZWFQ", "B0002KVUKM", "B000HCO83Q", "B003YOZNBU", "B000J10EQU", "B00003CXZ1", "B00E5I2M6I", "B000AYELVU", "B00005JMQW", "B008JFUO72", "B003Y5H5EW", "B000HEVZ9E", "B000AYELVA", "B000VI28Z6", "B00JL6L4UY", "B009MO57H6", "B00AEFYGBA", "B002ZG99B8", "B0083SBMBM", "B001CC7PKS", "B00005JKCH", "B0007WFX62", "B0006IIPIK", "6307397594", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B0009MDPYM", "B001OQCVI8", "B00JPS7HOA", "0780624890", "B00F4FFO8E", "B002GSXKN8", "B008JFUPFI", "B00IKM5LXG", "B00177Y9ZC", "B003YAR97K", "B002ZG98UA", "B002NXSRVG", "B000EQHXN2", "B001RHGRT8", "B00IZZDWKM", "B001GZ6QC4", "B004LWZWGA", "B0021L8V0M", "B000VR0570", "1558908846", "B001HN697M", "B00005JLYW", "B008JFURII", "B001MVWRNE", "B001FB55HQ", "B005LAII44", "B00A2H9OSK", "B001QTXM5Y", "B002ZG983M", "B00BTYMPUY", "B002U4UZSQ", "B001QB9H2E", "B002ZG99G8", "B005G4TJUC", "B0012RLX88", "B003Q6D2B4", "B00195FUDC", "B008Y1YK9Y", "B001OQCUZM", "B00HMVJB0K", "B002ZG98N2", "B00005JNJV", "B004SIP9Z6", "B000K7UBSO", "B00HEPDGKA"], "bought_together": ["B0002XVQNU", "B000VI70QS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005JLXE", "B0090SI56Y", "B00979KQAO", "B000VI28Z6"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 23534}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.99, "brand": "TCFHE", "asin": "B0007P0Y7C", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51R5W%2BoU9CL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Elektra (Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "Forty Gunsis the most rampantly sexualized Western ever made, and the most outrageous of Samuel Fuller's late-'50s B movies.  Fuller's original title was \"Woman with a Whip,\" referring to the hard-riding range baroness--Barbara Stanwyck, sporting silver hair and (most of the time) black, skintight man togs--who's \"the boss of Cochise County\" and a law unto herself.  The forty guns are an army of pistoleros who accompany her just about everywhere, and Fuller misses no opportunity to exaggerate their macho assertiveness in black-and-white CinemaScope, whether thundering along the horizon or formed up on either side of a preposterously long dinner table with Stanwyck at its head.  Barry Sullivan costars as a Wyatt Earp&#x96;like gunfighter who both threatens Stanwyck's empire and awakens her lust for something besides power.  As one of his brothers, Gene Barry (soon to star in Fuller's mind-blowing Vietnam movieChina Gate) enjoys a passionate liaison with a gunsmith's busty blond daughter (Eve Brent) whom he romances down the bore of a rifle--an image Jean-Luc Godard would memorialize inBreathless.  In the relentlessly double-entendre dialogue and the blocking of scenes, everything takes on sexual overtones: power and impotence, political advantage and exclusion.  Fuller and cameraman Joseph Biroc capture many sequences in single, minutes-long takes that often end in a death--and in one perverse instance, the revelation of a death that has occurred midway through without our knowing it.  (It's a T.S. Eliot moment, though we won't insist on it.)  Style is all in this movie, which will leave you either astonished or aghast.  More likely, both.--Richard T.

{"description": "It's goodbye to Capeside, hello to Boston inDawson's Creek's fifth season (a.k.a.:Dawson's Creek: The College Years).  While the end of thefourth seasonsent the five friends their separate ways--Dawson (James Van Der Beek) to USC Film School, Joey (Katie Holmes) to Worthington College, Jen (Michelle Williams) and Jack (Kerr Smith) to Boston Bay College; and Pacey (Joshua Jackson) to the high seas--it doesn't take them long to find themselves together again.  That's a good thing, especially when tragedy strikes a family member and threatens to tear the survivors apart.More than anything, the fifth season seems to be about falling into bad relationships.  Jen dates a cute but sleazy musician (Chad Michael Murray,One Tree Hill), Pacey gets a job in a restaurant where he pursues a woman (Lourdes Benedicto) already having an affair with a married man, then fends off a vampish new boss (Sherilyn Fenn,Twin Peaks).  Joey is drawn to her handsome English professor (Ken Marino).  And Jack joins a frat, becomes a jerk, and starts a devoted relationship with his beer bottle.  Dawson meets an eccentric young filmmaker (Jordan Bridges) which in turn leads to a meeting with his favorite Boston film critic (Meredith Salenger).  And Joey's new roommate, the annoyance-with-a-heart-of-gold Audrey (Busy Phillipps), becomes the newest major addition to the cast. The irritation factor is high this season, a couple of \"Joey is threatened\" interludes don't have the punch that they could have, and in the season finale, the inevitable resolution of the show's central relationship doesn't really resolve anything at all.  But viewers who have followed the Capeside crew for four seasons will still want to see what happens in the fifth.The fifth season is the first to have no DVD extras at all, and it continues the music-replacement strategy (which, since the second season has replaced much of the music, and since the third season has replaced Paula Cole's theme song, all due to licensing expenses).  In addition to the usual background-music switches, some scenes have been edited (for example, the episode \"Highway to Hell\" has cut two of the performances on-stage at the Drunk & Dead).  Also, the opening credits of \"The Long Goodbye\" and \"Downtown Crossing\" had originally used instrumental versions of \"I Don't Want to Wait,\" which had underscored the emotion of those episodes. In the DVD set, those have been replaced by the standard version and an instrumental version, respectively, of \"Run Like Mad.\"--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000EAT23C", "B0002RQ3MK", "B0002234R2", "B0000E5NPY", "B0000AUHQ9", "B00008AOX3", "B0001IN0T4", "B0077PTWHI", "B0077PTWY6", "B00127RAGM", "B000BNXD6O", "B00BGQ2NIO", "B000MEYJII", "B00LERXFJ6", "B00BGQ2NDO", "B0006FFRBG", "B000GYI32M", "B000C8STWQ", "B002BAW6HW", "B0012GN23S", "B000NA1PUG", "B002BAW6I6", "B003R0MF7G", "B005FISC52", "B001EWDXT8", "B0050MB5P2", "B00000IMY8", "B0012EM5DI", "B00133QNSG", "B003L77GEM", "B00133QNS6", "B002JVWRB8", "B0009K7QZ8", "B0012BS5XU", "B00133QNRW", "B001G0MFD8", "B0002V7TZQ", "B0017VG67M", "B00IXMF2K0", "B000EHQ7HY", "B0006J28DM", "B000FIMG5Y", "B000EHSVM8", "B003FSTN4S", "B00079FUI6", "B004YM6JQO", "B000MGBSHQ", "B000FUTVLO", "B004GJYRFA", "B000MGBSI0", "B000EHSVMS", "B00F1FVKVC", "B000FUTVPA", "B001ULCY48", "B000VDDE0E", "B004GSVX9O", "B00005JO9J", "B004MPRNAE", "B00BBGZ17O", "B002KQ6UE2", "B0053O8AFK", "B00HEQOAIQ", "B0018CWEZI", "B0011UBDS6", "B001FB4VX0", "B00IGBIKV6", "B000H7JCGE", "B001UHOWYM", "B00AEBB9UU", "B002BJGYV2", "B003F3NE1Q", "B000P6YNSO", "B000H7JCG4", "B000N6TYLW", "B00BMKGZVA", "B000I0QLS2", "B004SUDQ1I", "B0001CCXZW", "B00HQOFAKI", "B000GG4Y28", "B000R7I44K", "B000QUTTPG", "B000FIHN5M", "B00004X13T", "B002BJGYTY", "B002JVWRBS", "B000UAE7UY", "B000CRR3OC", "B009Z5BPZK", "B00684J49U", "B00915G6UI", "B00898M1QG", "B000EHSVLY", "B001DHXT5C", "B009LDCWWG", "B001ILFUA0", "B002BJGYU8", "B003R0MF6W", "B004WO9OS4", "B004YM6JF0"], "bought_together": ["B000EAT23C", "B0002RQ3MK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0002RQ3MK", "B005CGI3ZG", "B00008AOX3", "B0002234R2"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 29471}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 15.99, "brand": "Columbia Tri-Star", "asin": "B0007V6IW6", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51WY2M8ZHAL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Dawson's Creek - The Complete Fifth Season"}
{"description": "Hayley Westenra's live concert in her native New Zealand treads much of the same ground as other similar programs, including Charlotte Church, Sarah Brightman, Josh Groban, andCeltic Woman.  Drawing heavily from herPurealbum, the then-17-year-old covers a gamut of styles.  The more classical pieces include \"River of Dreams\" and \"Never Say Goodbye\" (which are based on Vivaldi and Ravel, respectively), Villa-Lobos's Bachianas Brasilierias No. 5, andCarmina Burana's \"In Trutina.\"  She sounds beautiful on Enya's \"May It Be\" fromThe Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring(which still hasn't been overexposed quite yet), but less successful are the \"hipper\" attempts into crossover territory, such as the Brightman-esque \"Beat of Your Heart\" and \"Who Painted the Moon Black.\"  Still, it's hard to fault a young artist for trying something different.  Guest stars include younger sister Sophie, Teddy Tahu Rhodes (whose heavy voice tends to overpower Westenra's), and groups as diverse as the Te Orowa Maori Dance Group and the Wellington Cathedral Choir.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001BBOSB4", "B004VPHPQ2", "B005RYF5JA", "B000MTDRJA", "B0024RIMBG", "B0001IXTIG", "B002UZXJAG", "B000AXWHPI", "B00BYR1W2S", "B0007M22TI", "B002PAQETO", "B000PUB4FA", "B000CNF4L0", "B00HF95OMI", "B00HGGUS4O", "B000UPWO5E", "B001KKU982", "B00DD348M2", "B00EZRY62C", "B004DQMSM0", "B00HF95PA4", "B00CJ03YZM", "B001Q8FSWU", "B004NG7SEI", "B00EZPCYFU", "B00IYUI47E", "B000CNF4KG", "B000CNF4LA", "B00EZPCWKM", "B0000JKLVO", "B001UWOLSE", "B002FWYL5G", "B0010V4TTQ", "B00J4KZSHW", "B000CNF4LK", "B00464CU7M", "B0010YPTGU", "B00472O3C8", "B001KKSDKS", "B000KRNCYY", "B0007GAEGC", "B000CNF4LU", "B00007CVRM", "B005F9CPEA", "B005FY0FRE", "B004DMAZQA", "B002UZXJA6", "B000FILWFE", "B00I56420A", "B000Y7ZHCU", "B000JR0C6Q", "B0047IIYY0", "B0046M4H7K", "B00062IDHE", "B005RYF5H2", "B00005ALLX", "B00004ZET8", "B000X3KZUE", "B0060RU2QO", "B008R3EYWM", "6305614350", "B007W38WQ2", "B00005Y6XP", "B00417HUVK", "B00F0MXB3G", "B0091V6SKK", "B00152PFAM", "B000JCEU50", "B003019LWY", "B0000TAOKW", "B002UPA4ZY", "B004M8SQB6", "B000053GTF", "B009HOU6BI", "B000VZK8JC", "B0001BS4LA", "B005VGMYZM", "B002LB6ELA", "B006PF64AO", "B0015XASFS", "B000VALY7W", "B003FXXO8O", "B0001GH7WW", "B000HKDECY", "B0000TG492", "B00480OTKA", "B003UPPO2G", "B00403CLK0", "B005GU8ECK", "B00063LTH4", "B000A8AXWW", "B00HUCF7WW", "B00D6QUJ6U", "B003W77SGC", "B0000TGADW", "B000I2ISF4", "B005FY0FPG", "B001PBQM6Y", "B009CVRQLY", "B00005NGAE"], "bought_together": ["B001BBOSB4", "B004VPHPQ2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001BBOSB4", "B00HGGUS4O", "B0024RIMBG", "B004VPHPQ2"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 94020}, "categories": [["CDs & Vinyl", "Pop", "Easy Listening"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Pop", "Oldies", "Traditional Pop"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Pop", "Vocal Pop"], ["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 17.84, "brand": "WESTENRA,HAYLEY", "asin": "B0007VCUGO", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51SGomcV3rL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Hayley Westenra - Live From New Zealand"}

{"description": "Remington Steele's fusion of whodunit mystery and screwball comedy burst onto television in 1982. After struggling to get clients to hire a female detective, Laura Holt (sultry Stephanie Zimbalist) invents a fictional boss named Remington Steele, whose dashing manly name draws in work. But while protecting some South African jewels, Holt runs across a mysterious thief and con-man (an elfin, baby-faced Pierce Brosnan) whom her client assumes is the nonexistent Steele--and when the case is resolved, the accidental detective decides he likes the work and sticks around, infuriating Holt with his arrogant ways and tantalizing her with his dashing good looks. Murders may occur at a winery, an island sex club, or a college reunion, but just about every episode plunders plot elements from classic movies likeBringing Up Baby,The Third Man, andThe Trouble with Harry(even the theme song was written by film composer Henry Mancini). The writers openly acknowledge this influence by having Steele use ideas he's lifted from movies to solve crimes. The constant allusions to old films should be annoying, but the show demonstrates such a rich affection for the classics that these tips of the hat actually mesh withRemington Steele's world.Remington Steelehas become best known as Brosnan's launching pad (he later become James Bond inGoldenEyeand its sequels), but Zimbalist was every bit as crucial to the show's success; her mixture of glamor and toughness gives the show a distinctly adult sexiness and grounds Brosnan's boyish charm. The dialogue sometimes slipped from arch camp to sheer cheese, but even at its most ridiculous (say, a scene where Holt and Steele question homeless bums while dressed in formal evening wear)Remington Steeleremains an eminently watchable show, thanks to zippy plotting and the chemistry between Zimbalist and Brosnan. Some episodes clearly implied that the pair had become intimate, yet that didn't defuse their attraction. Even when the stories became a bit silly, the mutual respect and desire between Holt and Steele never lost its sophistication.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000AQ68SC", "B000E6ESC6", "B000FKO3HG", "B0007XBMA2", "B000ASDFIG", "B00005JOJR", "B000GRU09I", "B003L77FWA", "B000SK5Z70", "B000CRR3NI", "B0069NPEV2", "B003L77FWU", "B000GW8UAE", "B009L0NC82", "B006CR2OWM", "0792844068", "B002WQ79A4", "B00005JMHI", "B000BGR1B4", "B0012E2F60", "B001JTRKHW", "B0009NZ30A", "B000LXGXY8", "B00HV0TJM2", "B00008YLV5", "B00005JO3P", "B007V4QLWE", "B00006G8FD", "B008X8U83K", "B0002I84N0", "B003GOOZGW", "B000BF0C8E", "B00DJYJQSQ", "B0013FZUP6", "B000YKYT1M", "B000N2HD6O", "B00005JNHS", "B005I0DV2G", "B000XJD3K2", "B004OB2EYQ", "B0007KZQAM", "B00008DDVT", "B004D45NXI", "B00005U8QM", "B000E5KQMI", "B000BUE5DC", "B0030Y12AK", "B000GEIRVY", "B00G4NV7B8", "B00113ALL8", "B000WP07F6", "B00IXXVCT4", "B0036TGSR6", "B00005JNHU", "B000HWZ4HU", "B00005JLEY", "B001E6JC1M", "B00005JNHT", "B000EQ5UIC", "B0007LXP86", "B001JFKWE4", "B000B5XSVM", "B00GHH9HW2", "B00317LM7Y", "B001675ZJW", "B005TTEG5W", "B000LXGXWK", "B0006IUDXA", "B000TZX5XK", "B0002COTDA", "B000RPCK1U", "B000Z6GT18", "B0012EM5EW", "B00ESK1PES", "B003QTDH8E", "B0028S110K", "B00ALTQRNO", "B000NOIX66", "B00096S46M", "B005HWAOH0", "B001J0FVYK", "B000NDEXO8", "B009RO9LKK", "B000VDDDZA", "B002LFQIL2", "B00E8AVN9U", "B000HXDWG4", "B00JDCP0QA", "1603993428", "B0030VANIU", "B000GPPNO2", "B000H1RFXM", "B007AAF3FK", "B000GNOSHW", "B000GW8UAO", "B000M9BPGC", "B001ACFQNS", "B00005JN8S", "B00096S480", "B003BGZ61S"], "bought_together": ["B000AQ68SC", "B000FKO3HG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000FKO3HG", "B000ASDFIG", "B000AQ68SC", "B00005JOJR"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 28738}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 19.95, "brand": "20TH Century Fox", "asin": "B00096S45S", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5195PFG0SRL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Remington Steele: Season 1"}

{"description": "Batjac is a strong, legendary-sounding name--the corporate logo for the last among several production companies John Wayne established, and the evocative catch-all label to designate the producer-star's late-career legacy apart from his milestone work with the likes of John Ford and Howard Hawks. The name seems to summon up associations with flying and Native American culture and maybe a lean jungle cat... but it was a made-up word that had been applied to an East Indian trading company in Wayne's little-remembered 1948 productionWake of the Red Witch. The actor took it for his own company, the one he formed after breaking with hisIsland in the SkyandThe High and the Mightypartner in Wayne-Fellows Productions (Robert Fellows). He chose it because he remembered he'd enjoyed pronouncing it while makingRed Witch. It was Batjack back then, with ak, and it was supposed to be Batjack again--only the first order of stationery came back with the name misspelled, and rather than spring several hundred bucks for a new batch, Wayne let \"Batjac\" stand.That droll tidbit is characteristic of the inside reminiscences shared in \"The Batjac Story,\" one of eight featurettes accompanying the DVD release ofThe High and the Mighty. From it we also learn that a Wayne unit shot \"from sunup to sundown\"; that the Duke was the egalitarian boss of a tight-knit company wherein relatives, co-workers, and the relatives of co-workers earned advancement by merit; and that the star was shrewd enough and powerful enough to retain full possession of copyright on Batjac films. A short on the career and personality of director \"Wild Bill\" Wellman includes the revelation that a lot of major stars declined roles in the ensemble movie (probably to their eventual regret), and that Spencer Tracy--originally cast as \"Whistlin' Dan\" Roman--\"ankled\" at the last moment ... necessitating Wayne's reluctantly taking on the part that became one of his best-remembered, indeed iconic, roles (theH&M;theme music accompanied his final public appearance, at the spring 1979 Oscars). An especially entertaining profile of composer Dimitri Tiomkin notes that he collected the only Oscar among the film's many nominations--for music score, not (as is widely believed) best song. The theme song, a huge popular hit that helped make the movie such a pervasive Event of the '50s, wasn't even in the film as most people saw it; it had been cut in the effort to get the length down, but was cut back in for a week's run in Los Angeles to qualify for an Academy nomination. Nor was it the tune Whistlin' Dan actually whistled during filming; that was George M. Cohan's \"Mary\"!Anchored by pop film historian Leonard Maltin, and backed almost nonstop by musical themes recycled from theH&M;soundtrack, the featurettes occasionally resemble weekend sports highlight reels designed to keep armchair fans revved up till the main event. The overall tone is nostalgic/reverential, ceremonially befitting the re-emergence of a long-\"lost\" treasure. Only British film historian and heroic restoration specialist Kevin Brownlow quietly supplies some authoritative critical perspective:The High and the Mightyis not now and never was agreatmotion picture, but it was an understandably and deservedly beloved movie with \"a mystique\" unique in its power and endurance. That's well worth celebrating.--Richard T.

These parallel lives unfold, with Vincent's celebrated wallow in the fires of art running alongside Theo's neurotic struggle to fit into the real world. Roth is mesmerizing and frightening as Vincent, while Rhys gives a more mannered performance that fits Theo's tortured ambivalence. The eerie buzz of Gabriel Yared's music helps us get inside Vincent's head. If the true-life circumstances are unavoidably grim and Altman's pace is slow, almost druggy, the film nevertheless casts a spell.

{"description": "Oh, the torments of being a teenaged surgeon! It's funny that a nation known for distrusting intellect would embrace a show about a young genius who becomes a doctor at 14. Debuting in 1989,Doogie Howser, M.D.originally emphasized Doogie's medical career, contrasting the issues of life and death with star Neil Patrick Harris's chipmunk cheeks and buoyant energy. Season Two tilted more towards Doogie's life as a teenager--particular the bubbling of his adolescent hormones, often sparked by the schemes of Doogie's best friend, the relentless horndog Vinnie Delpino (Max Casella, later to appear inEd WoodandThe Sopranos). The show's sexual frankness can be startling--it's hard to imagine a contemporary show that would openly advocate condoms, as Doogie does when he makes public health promotions for a music video channel.Given the gimmicky nature of the premise, it's also surprising how emotionally complexDoogie Howser, M.D.could be. The season opens with a realistic investigation into Doogie's lost youth and closes with a multi-episode storyline about Doogie's girlfriend Wanda (Lisa Dean Ryan,Surfacing) struggling with depression after losing her mother in a car crash. Of course, the show was just as often silly (Vinnie enlists his friends to make a zombie/slasher movie) or awash in sentimentality--Doogie's journal entries, which conclude every episode, could be wincingly sappy. But even at its weakest, producer Stephen Bochco (creator ofL.A. LawandHill Street Blues, who createdDoogie Howser, M.D.with David Kelley, creator ofAlly McBeal) kept the writing and directing crisp, and the cast (including James Sikking, Belinda Montgomery, and Lawrence Pressman as the adults in Doogie's life) turned in solid work. Harris successfully carried off the role of a genius who still had the emotional confusions of youth; it's jarring to see him as an adult in a short interview, included as an extra, as well as an interview with Casella (who, it turns out, was already in his 20s when the show began). The show rested on Harris' shoulders, and, like his character, he carried his responsibilities lightly and with style.Warning: Repeated exposure to the theme song will inspire suicidal thoughts; fast forward through the credits to preserve your sanity.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00076YOZY", "B000BO0KN2", "B000EBGF6I", "B000SQFC0O", "B00DDHFKMA", "B00HW3L9MG", "B00CVB6XDO", "B00F1FVKVC", "B000Y7U9AK", "B00E4Q6U9Q", "B00BBGZ17O", "B000B8384G", "B000CELOV8", "B001JAHQ0M", "B000LC4C60", "B001J2XROY", "B0009I7NH6", "B00CYQXATG", "B00CL152AY", "B001L1S1OO", "B00005JO4F", "B000CCBCHQ", "B000BUE5DC", "B000A0GORS", "B000B5XOUM", "B0002EJ7JY", "B000NJISIY", "B004GJYR82", "B003L77FZM", "B0053O89QU", "B002JVWQUU", "B00005PJ6N"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00076YOZY", "B000BO0KN2", "B000EBGF6I", "B005D0OHA6"]}, "price": 30.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 59521}, "asin": "B000A3DGEO", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51AYBDZNB5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Doogie Howser, M.D.: Season 2"}

{"description": "The question facing any viewer of the Japanese CG featureFinal Fantasy VII: Advent Childrenis: do you have to know the games on which it&#x92;s based in order to understand the film? And the answer is: it certainly helps. But even complete novices (i.e., most parents) in theFinal Fantasyworld will find some entertainment in its wealth of fantasy-based action, and the animation never fails to astonish. Picking up two years after an epic battle between the forces of good (represented by brooding soldier Cloud) and evil (Cloud&#x92;s former general, Sephiroth),FFVIIopens in the devastated city of Midgard, whose youthful occupants suffer from a ghastly disease known as Geostigma. A trio of brothers arrives with what appears to be a cure for the plague, but their gesture conceals a more sinister purpose: to revive Sephiroth and bring about the end of the world. Cloud and his companions must once again rise to the occasion to stop the siblings and the revived Sephiroth from unleashing total destruction. Complex and self-referential to the point of occasional incomprehension,Final Fantasy VIIwill definitely be most appreciated by fans of the game series, but if others can look past the numbing dialogue and frenetic action (which is a bit too intense for very young children), the film offers a carefree and action-packed viewing experience. The two-disc set contains the original Japanese language version of the film as well as an English-dubbed edition (Rachel Leigh Cook and Christy Carlson Romano, among others, provide the vocal talent) and a version edited for the Venice Film Festival. A 30-minute featurette that recaps theFinal Fantasystory up toVII, as well as a making-of documentary, deleted scenes, and promotions for futureFinal Fantasy VIIgames and products round out the extras.--Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00003CY5D", "B000FDOTIQ", "B0007OY31G", "B00000JRSB", "B0014X7SQ6", "B008H6GHL0", "B001I9XOQO", "B0010358CQ", "B000QXDFQM", "B00005V1XW", "B00005TNI6", "B001TD6SN0", "B000XYBIKO", "B009AVC922", "B000LOAQNQ", "B001JTADR6", "074401543X", "1566867142", "B0000296O5", "B00ENNBZ68", "B00008URUA", "B001CMIUYS", "B002I0GXWO", "B008H6GH8I", "0744010241", "B00005LOXE", "0804162867", "B003IFVKM6", "6304493681", "B000KF0P1Y", "B000FQ2DTA", "B00002R28C", "B000FS2VZO", "B00008RUYZ", "B004JPJHMY", "B002U6CJO2", "B0009A4EVM", "B000AO8CH4", "B0012Z5UM0", "B0047WMHGC", "B0001O3YA8", "B00003CXBK", "B005H0OEJ6", "B000GABOTU", "B004DMIISM", "162692032X", "B00005NG6U", "B00AO075UY", "B000Y53HH4", "B005NQ5LLE", "B00EZ227X2", "B001GXI4LM", "B002I0GZ5Y", "B004L6Y0T6", "B001G3B0HC", "B00005V4XG", "B00KN16YHO", "B001OQCVI8", "0767802454", "B002MIK0TE", "B000R37S00", "B00BY0G0YU", "B00009WAUH", "0307468372", "B005I65NBW", "B00GHJX8W0", "B008SBZD5U", "B000F6ZIFQ", "0316401196", "B001C4ZQEI", "B000CDGVOO", "B002FVPFUC", "B00004TC6E", "B004COLCK2", "B00005JNJV", "B000NDRNMM", "B00GOT13BQ", "B00004Y57G", "B0045U4U52", "B001TD6SK8", "B0002A2S26", "B002S4DOA4", "B0036BDQ88", "B0013FID78", "B007NU542O", "B000NPTOTK", "B0071LEH14", "1421500493", "B0010YOQIW", "B002O3Z50Q", "B003F3NEAC", "B00829H3E2", "B000BKSJ52", "B00356GVRW", "0744000416", "B000CDGVOE"], "bought_together": ["B00003CY5D", "B0007OY31G"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00C3MKCF6", "B0029XFQF0", "B004LWZW4M", "B004DMIIVO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 25738}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.64, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B000AMJG4Y", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51J3SJW6H0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Final Fantasy VII - Advent Children (Two-Disc Special Edition)"}

{"description": "Horror buffs will surely be compelled to compare and contrastDominionwithExorcist: The Beginning, two films weirdly linked by film history. Director Paul Schrader shotDominiononly to find studio bosses underwhelmed by its horror aspects, at which point Renny Harlin was hired to direct another take on the subject with the same lead actor, setting, and similar storyline. That became the 2004 theatrical releaseExorcist: The Beginning.As expected, the Schrader version has more tortured religiosity and visual poetry than Harlin's cheesier (but admittedly gripping) re-do. Father Merrin (Stellan Skarsgard) carries his guilt from the Nazi occupation to a remote African archaeological dig, where a mysteriously buried church has been uncovered. Strange stuff happens nearby, and a fervent young priest (good performance by Gabriel Mann) parries spiritual points with the now-doubting Merrin. Some of the ideas are strong and the sun-and-sand cinematography by the great Vittorio Storaro is often stunning. As beautiful as the film is to look at, it must be admitted that the climax is disappointingly flat, the leading lady (Clara Bellar) is a washout, and one begins to yearn for the occasional genre shock of the kind Schrader was able to conjure up in his remake ofCat People. If you're anExorcistfan, watch it for its serious treatment of Merrin's crisis, which ties in to his character in the 1973 original.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00065HKLG", "B000067FP5", "B0000399W9", "B003UGLCIA", "B000HEWEGC", "B00KDU8HQQ", "B00HRUQ8X4", "B003L20IEW", "B00HRCBGRA", "B00HNTOVWE", "B00FYV7WCY", "B00DYRNGQ6", "B000BTJDGC", "B0029EW7BA", "B00IKM5LFY", "B004EPYZO4", "B00HHYF570", "B00EF0NY7W", "B001KKU9CI", "B00GJ7CUFG", "B001992NW4", "B003VE9WP6", "B00096S48U", "B00GHH9IIA", "B000AM4P9K", "B000099T3M", "B00EZ50SGW", "B00018D42W", "B000S0GYRU", "B000056T5E", "B00GDDNFDW", "B00D7AM5U8", "B00D7AM698", "B002LMSWN2", "B0085Z3AMW", "B0011NVC98", "B00452J5KU", "B000PMLJMQ", "B00DEQQK8S", "B00003CXCF", "B00D7AM5XU", "B0089N4G50", "B0000CDRVX", "B00009PY4G", "0783116926", "B00111YM5Q", "B00000IQVC", "B00CPTUNVA", "B00H9LHX8K", "6305718954", "B003SG8122", "B00004TS0G", "B000HCO86I", "B001TK80C0", "B001QB9H1U", "B00DI012O2", "B000Q66Q8I", "B009B8YNGO", "B00BWJQEFI", "B0000694XX", "B0002IQLH6", "B00AIBZM40", "B004B3PBFQ", "B00001TZ6Q", "B00AEFYYH6", "B0021L8UFI", "B00A50PDS4", "B000FA57UI", "B00BEJL6Q8", "B001P3SA9Y", "B0000AOX0A", "B000EHQTZO", "6301971345", "B00000K3TO", "B0000AOX09", "B00195FUDC", "0767817737", "B000QGEB1W", "B00A429Y9M", "B000QQJ3Q0", "B000EOTV98", "B000CNE0M4", "B00F98FOI6", "B00005JNTU", "B001OQCVI8", "0767847431", "B00000F3SB", "B00EZ50R04", "B001NPD9LS", "B001DJLD1W", "B00AWWX6XY", "B001KVZ6ES", "B002VWNIDG", "B00GDDNMEY", "B00HF98SY4", "B001CFLGYQ", "B000GCFO0I", "B001BNFRB2", "B0067QPVD2", "B00BEIYMAG"], "bought_together": ["B00065HKLG", "B000067FP5"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00065HKLG", "B0000399W9", "B000HEWEGC", "B003UGLCIA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 38870}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.51, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B000AYEL4W", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HpsR6nFNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Dominion - Prequel to the Exorcist"}

{"description": "On the surface, David Cronenberg may seem an unlikely candidate to directA History of Violence, but dig deeper and you'll see that he's the right man for the job. As an intellectual seeker of meaning and an avowed believer in Darwinian survival of the fittest, Cronenberg knows that the story of mild-mannered small-town diner proprietor Tom Stall (Viggo Mortensen) is in fact a multilayered examination of inbred human behavior, beginning when Tom's skillful killing of two would-be robbers draws unwanted attention to his idyllic family life in rural Indiana. He's got a loving wife (Maria Bello) and young daughter (Heidi Hayes) who are about to learn things about Tom they hadn't suspected, and a teenage son (Ashton Holmes) who has inherited his father's most prominent survival trait, manifesting itself in ways he never expected. By the time Tom has come into contact with a scarred villain (Ed Harris) and connections that lead him to a half-crazy kingpin (William Hurt, in a spectacular cameo), Cronenberg has plumbed the dark depths of human nature so skillfully thatA History of Violencestands well above the graphic novel that inspired it (indeed, Cronenberg was unaware of the source material behind Josh Olson's chilling adaptation). With hard-hitting violence that's as sudden as it is graphically authentic, this isA History of Violencethat's worthy of serious study and widespread acclaim.--Jeff ShannonOn the DVDOn a single disc and with little fanfare, this DVD makes an excellent case for the best extras of the year. Dive into the one-hour-long documentary and learn more about moviemaking than on many a double-disc. The secret lies in director David Cronenberg's (and his usual crew) folksy casualness in showing off the craft, be it makeup (green screens were used), directing (Cronenberg doesn't storyboard), or art direction (the diner set). It also is very funny to hear about \"fish Fridays\" and how Maria Bello's Uncle Pete became an influence. Even the infamous sex-on-the-staircase scene is diagnosed with candor as stars Viggo Mortensen and Bello act as if there is no backstage camera. There's only one deleted scene, but it's uncommonly deconstructed on why it was filmed and why it was cut (it's a very Cronenbergian dream sequence). A short bit on Cannes is also a delight. So much is here that Cronenberg's smart commentary track is nearly superfluous. Isn't that a nice surprise?--Doug ThomasMore to ExploreThe Graphic NovelOther Graphic Novels that Inspired MoviesDavid Cronenberg EssentialsWhy We Love Maria BelloThe work of Viggo MortensenThe work of William HurtStills fromA History of ViolenceViggo Mortensoe as Tom StallAshton Holmes as Jack Stall and Kyle Schmid as Bobby JordanWilliam Hurt as Richie CusackEd Harris as Carl Fogarty and Viggo Mortensen as Tom StallMaria Bello as Edie StallDirector David Cronenberg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000YENUI6", "B001LRJH0U", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B008R65XP6", "B004SIP8ZM", "B001FB5634", "B0001EFV7C", "B00004W18Z", "B001EIOOWC", "6301971345", "B000M341QE", "B00000K31T", "B000GFLKF8", "B000P0J0D8", "0767802519", "B004SUDQ72", "B003ASLJQS", "B002PJYPYG", "6304698747", "B000F5WR4W", "B003Y5H4R0", "B0018O4YT0", "B00AEBB9CS", "B0028OH568", "B00HOGBXS6", "B00000JDIQ", "B000FUTVLY", "B002AT8KAG", "B000XR9L50", "6305313687", "0783228457", "B002QEHPQU", "B001FB55L2", "B000Y7WGOW", "B002VWNIEA", "B00022XE6S", "B006PTL1QM", "B000P0J0AG", "B004499LX0", "B00005JMOW", "B002T9H2LA", "B001TOD92C", "B005OK721G", "B000FKO5QK", "B0019EXZY4", "B002ZG99N6", "B0007DFJ0G", "B003LR5BD0", "B003RHZ6F2", "B00AEFY5B6", "B000N6TX1I", "0792833279", "B005LAIIJY", "B000FVQM2Y", "B000FC2FX8", "B001BNFRB2", "B00005JN0W", "B002XMGGK6", "B00007E8UI", "B0064NTZQ2", "B00D3DJIG8", "B0010DR4BO", "B0013XZ6X4", "B00AEFXE9U", "B007D5E7C2", "B000ALM40I", "B00001ZWUS", "B00005V9HH", "B00008RH3L", "0783229402", "B000QXDCLK", "B000P0J0EW", "B000BBOUUE", "B000A7DVR2", "B000K7VHQ4", "B00000F4MA", "B000XA5K48", "B00004XPPB", "B0002IQMAM", "B00029LNYQ", "B00003CXWV", "B004XQO90O", "B000GIW9I2", "B004U7MR14", "B002DKGWSE", "B0064MT1FI", "B0000TANUI", "B009T3AE1Y", "B0000VLKVM", "B00006LPGP", "B00005JLRE", "B000F7CMRM", "B00AEFXESQ", "B001DZOC64", "1558908315", "B0036TGTDE", "B000NOKFHQ", "B008220DGE", "B00007AJE1", "B000BVM1S2"], "bought_together": ["B000YENUI6", "B001LRJH0U"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000YENUI6", "B008MILL78", "B009T3AE1Y", "B000M341QE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 45602}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.36, "brand": "Warner Brothers", "asin": "B000CQLZ0Q", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51g0dghsrYL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "A History of Violence (New Line Platinum Series) [DVD]"}
{"description": "A decade after their last hilarious short, the Oscar-winningA Close Shave, Claymation wonders Wallace and Gromit return for a full-length adventure. Daffy scientist Wallace (voiced by Peter Sallis) and his heroic dog Gromit are doing well with their business, Anti-Pesto, a varmint-hunting outfit designed to keep their English town safe from rabbits chomping on prized vegetables. Wallace meets Lady Tottington (Helena Bonham Carter), who appreciates Wallace's humane way of dealing with rabbits (courtesy of the Bun-Vac 6000), and sets up a rivalry with the gun-toting Victor Quartermaine (Ralph Fiennes, enjoying himself more than ever). Creator Nick Park, with co-director/writer Steve Box, delivers a story worthy of the 85-minute running time, although it stretches the act a bit; the formula plays better shorter, but the literally hand-crafted film is a joy to watch. Taking a chapter from classic horror films, a giant were-rabbit is soon on the prowl, and the town is up in arms, what with the annual vegetable contest close at hand. (Anyone who's seen the previous three shorts knows who saves the day.) Never content to do something simply when the extravagant will do, W&G;'s lives are filled with whimsical Rude Goldberg-style devices, and the opening number showcasing their alarm system is pure Aardman Animation at its finest. Even though there's a new twist here--a few mild sight gags aimed at adults--this G-rated film will delight young and old alike as Park, like team Pixar, seems incapable of making anything but an outstanding film.--Doug ThomasSee more clay animation and Wallace &amp; Gromit titles...Director Nick Park on DVDStop-Motion &amp; Clay Animation TitlesWallace &amp; GromitStuff Galore", "related": {"also_bought": ["B006W4KVI4", "B002DPVI0Q", "B001LXIDTK", "B00003CXJ4", "B001LXIDTA", "B001LXIDT0", "B002DR2GJQ", "B000M343BC", "B000W089WO", "B001OC6RZA", "B001F0TT8I", "B004AGN9MG", "B000AA4JNE", "B002ZG4QDE", "B000A2UBOI", "B003BJODIC", "B004KV93AI", "B00005JNQS", "B000H7JCK0", "B0072GOJ48", "B006W4KRRY", "B002WJI2QQ", "B0012EM5D8", "B002D755B2", "B0006JMLRK", "B0000640SC", "B004ZQJ5FQ", "B001DPHDCY", "0783231474", "6305161887", "B000MV9026", "B0034G4P26", "B001ECQ75A", "B0045I3EQA", "B000BITUVG", "B005FNLUFQ", "B000ION23A", "B007Z2DO0E", "B003XEKXWK", "B004HO6I4M", "B001GCUO7A", "B003TJM60G", "B000AY74OG", "B003E66Y84", "B00000JL8E", "B00005JMQZ", "B00009M9BK", "B000DWMYQ8", "B00003CXG7", "B0000AK7AB", "B00029LO0Y", "B0001906W2", "B0006UEVT0", "B00CWM58WY", "B000RMJ4F8", "B002ZG97YM", "B0019BI11E", "B0052MXJ3Q", "B0034G4P1W", "B000MNOX9E", "B004EPZ034", "B00DBVHHDS", "B00I6JOD2S", "B005LAIHW2", "B000IFRT2O", "B005F96UJ6", "1782760326", "B0039N74CW", "B0045ZAQS2", "B000BB1MI2", "B000UVKGPI", "B0030ZIZRC", "B000C3L27U", "B001PR0YEE", "B003UAKE9Y", "B005SDUV4E", "B001HN6918", "B003RHZ6IE", "B001FTIJS0", "B0013FSL3E", "B00CO9N6CY", "B000VBJEEG", "B00009YXAW", "B0015XWUAY", "B00AEFYXD6", "B00007LVCM", "B0034GK74G", "B0042U94UQ", "B00CHVJODE", "B00008G8LM", "B00A8KJK7G", "B000G75AZC", "B00005JN4W", "B000ROAK2W", "B005LAII62", "B00E00OGE2", "B007J3ISKK", "6305123454"], "bought_together": ["B00003CXJ4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0044RFTBA", "B002DPVI0Q", "B00I0VTOMG", "B001LXIDTA"]}, "price": 5.0, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 5628}, "asin": "B000CZ0PT4", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61MzjQMqG%2BL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Wallace &amp; Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit (Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "The latest entry in theHarry Pottersaga could be retitledFast Times at Hogwarts, where finding a date to the winter ball is nearly as terrifying as worrying about Lord Voldemort's return. Thus, the young wizards' entry into puberty (and discovery of the opposite sex) opens up a rich mining field to balance out the dark content in the fourth movie (and the stories are only going to get darker). Mike Newell (Four Weddings and a Funeral) handily takes the directing reins and eases his young cast through awkward growth spurts into true young actors. Harry (Daniel Radcliffe, more sure of himself) has his first girl crush on fellow student Cho Chang (Katie Leung), and has his first big fight with best bud Ron (Rupert Grint). Meanwhile, Ron's underlying romantic tension with Hermione (Emma Watson) comes to a head over the winter ball, and when she makes one of those girl-into-woman Cinderella entrances, the boys' reactions indicate they've all crossed a threshold.But don't worry, there's plenty of wizardry and action inGoblet of Fire. When the deadly Triwizard Tournament is hosted by Hogwarts, Harry finds his name mysteriously submitted (and chosen) to compete against wizards from two neighboring academies, as well as another Hogwarts student. The competition scenes are magnificently shot, with much-improved CGI effects (particularly the underwater challenge). And the climactic confrontation with Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes, in a brilliant bit of casting) is the most thrilling yet.Goblet, the first installment to get a PG-13 rating, contains some violence as well as disturbing images for kids and some barely shrouded references at sexual awakening (Harry's bath scene in particular). The 2 1/2-hour film, lean considering it came from a 734-page book, trims out subplots about house-elves (they're not missed) and gives little screen time to the standard crew of the otherPotterfilms, but adds in more of Britain's finest actors to the cast, such as Brendan Gleeson as Mad-Eye Moody and Miranda Richardson as Rita Skeeter. Michael Gambon, in his second round as Professor Dumbledore, still hasn't brought audiences around to his interpretation of the role he took over after Richard Harris died, but it's a small smudge in an otherwise spotless adaptation.--Ellen A.

The next year, Jesse started seeing Danny's co-host, Becky (Lori Loughlin), who became a mother figure to Stephanie (Jodie Sweetin), D.J. (Candace Cameron), and Michelle (Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen). Taking a page from the Brady Bunch playbook, the year begins with a trip to Hawaii to celebrate their anniversary as an extended family. In the season premiere (\"Tanner's Island\"), Uncle Jesse even gets to sing a song by his hero, Elvis Presley (Blue Hawaii's \"Rock-a-Hula Baby\"). After they return, it's time for Stephanie and D.J. to head back to class. Stephanie's first day in second grade is a blast, while D.J.'s first day in junior high is a bust (\"Back to School Blues\"), but things improve once she stops trying so hard to fit in.

{"description": "Ask a certain portion of diehardAndy Griffith Showfans why  the series' sixth season (1965-66) is less well-loved than others from  its eight-year run, and the answer boils down to four words: \"Warren  Ferguson\" and \"color episodes.\"  Played by veteran comedian and writer  Jack Burns, Warren was the replacement for Don Knotts' Barney Fife as  Andy's sheriff, and lasted for just eleven of the season's 30 episodes  before vanishing without a trace. The brickbats heaved at Warren are  undeserved, though; replacing the multi-Emmy-winning Knotts was a task  that few performers would have relished facing (and indeed, Knotts  earned another Emmy for his return to the series in two episodes, \"The  Return of Barney Fife\" and \"The Legend of Barney Fife\"), and Burns  certainly gives his all (including his signature, rapid-fire  \"huh-huh-huh\" gag line) to the character. He's no Barney Fife, and who  could be, aside from Knotts? As for the color issue, the debate seems  to be centered entirely around preference, although it's true that in  syndication, viewer response has been traditionally stronger to the  black-and-white broadcasts of seasons 1-5.Aside from the Barney/Warren and color controversies, the sixth season  is notable for the final appearances of supporting characters Malcolm  Merriweather (Bernard Fox) and Ernest T. Bass (the great Howard Morris)  in \"Malcolm at the Crossroads\" (in which the pair tangle over a  crosswalk), as well as such fun episodes as \"The Taylors in Hollywood\"  (Andy, Opie, and Aunt Bee react to a movie being made about them, withThe Love Boat's Gavin McLeod as the movie Andy); \"Andy's Rival\"  (Charles Aidman guest stars as a new teacher whose working relationship  with Helen Crump makes Andy nervous); and \"Otis the Artist\" (an amusing  Warren episode, in which he suggests painting to Otis as a substitute  for drinking).Andy Griffithcompletists will also note the  presence of Jack Dodson in the episode \"Lost and Found\"; Dodson would  later join the series as Deputy Howard Sprague and transition with most  of the supporting cast toMayberry R.F.D.As with previous  Griffith boxed sets, this five-disc set features no extras.--Paul  Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000FSME10", "B000HWZ4IY", "B000BYRCF6", "B000B8I9ZY", "B0009UC7MK", "B0007Y08P6", "B0002NY8PI", "B003SLEDJC", "B00LT1JKN2", "B00H8KC1N4", "B0013LRKV2", "B001DHXT4I", "B0018E03CW", "B00198X0YK", "B008VNI9TC", "B004DCM5RC", "B001992NZG", "B008L3650M", "B008VNIBTK", "B0014FAIYS", "B00HQLZCIQ", "B00JEZWRE4", "B001DHXT66", "B0001AVZDU", "B0001IN0BC", "B000VDDE1I", "B000EGDANO", "B00007IG1K", "B0038SUBDC", "B001E549KC", "B005D7E7Y0", "B000G6BL7O", "B00FM4S8IU", "B000FSME1K", "B001JAHQQ6", "B00GWJIDB6", "B00F6D62O4", "B000IHYXIK", "B008L3653O", "B00016XN48", "B000E6ES9Y", "B001LM64VK", "B000B5XOUM", "B000ASDFIQ", "B00IP965IO", "B003IB0FTE", "B000YKYT1M", "B000HIVIOM", "B001BN4WHW", "B005DCJ0Q0", "B000M343AI", "B0041SI7B6", "B00KBES386", "B00K3KI4T6", "B000HWZ4J8", "B000GW8U9U", "B006UKX63W", "B00650RWGO", "B000CCBCHQ", "B001E6JC30", "B00GV8B1BM", "B000O59A1G", "B008VNI9EW", "B001LRTT30", "B00HMOWA0A", "B0008JIJ1K", "B00280QNKG", "B000EQ5PTQ", "B005SQRYQY", "B003IRUFB6", "B00HRUQBJ0", "B006IRQUIA", "B0000B1A5A", "B000PISZ86", "B0009B16TO", "B00FJO95TE", "B00650RWZA", "B001F7AQDS", "B002ZTLVXY", "B000A9QKSM", "B0025X4PBA", "B00650RX90", "B000N6UF10", "B000QUEQ6I", "B001B187C0", "B000M343B2", "B0030BS1E8", "B0046S8MRU", "B000A0GORS", "B0007WFY4S", "B0025X4PAQ", "B007V973KI", "B004MLEYV4", "B0009UC80G", "B00FWMVVF4", "B00CD45JDE", "B00IS6WQ2S", "B0025Y3SZS", "B00650RX72", "B008H6GH9W"], "bought_together": ["B000FSME10", "B000BYRCF6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000BYRCF6", "B0007Y08P6", "B0009UC7MK", "B000B8I9ZY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 18689}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 10.13, "brand": "Paramount", "asin": "B000EBGE82", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/6195KHV3D1L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Andy Griffith Show - The Complete Sixth Season"}
{"description": "Northern Exposure - The Complete First SeasonWhether it's a snowy nude sprint down Main Street, the mysterious appearance of a long-lost relative, or the improbable death of yet another of Maggie's boyfriends, life's never dull in the remote hamlet of Cicely, Alaska. Colorful characters and quirky plots propelledNorthern Exposureinto the hearts of millions of viewers, earning the CBS \"dramedy\" series seven Emmy awards between its 1990 debut and its demise six seasons later. In season 1, we meet Dr. Joel Fleischman (Rob Morrow), an urban New York yuppie who consents to four years of rural servitude after Alaska pays his medical-school tuition. Joel's fish-out-of-water adventures drive the show, but it's the quirky ensemble of characters--Chris, the DJ/philosopher (John Corbett), Holling, the bartender (John Cullum), Maurice, the town patriarch (Barry Corbin), Ed, the filmmaker (Darren E. Burrows), and Maggie, the bush pilot (Janine Turner), among others&#x96;-that keeps the series consistently entertaining. The town develops its own offbeat personality as well, a Mayberry-meets-Twin-Peaks blend of Native mysticism, Aurora Borealis-induced dreams, unlikely tales of long-lost family members, and rumors of a Bigfoot-like creature known simply as \"Adam.\"Northern Exposureprovides a utopian escape--a place where life is interesting but never dangerous, everyone's insightful, the mystical becomes real, and nobody's burdened with a mundane 9-to-6 desk job. Cicely is a delightful place to visit, even if it's only for an hour at a time.  A mid-season replacement, season 1 consists of just eight episodes on two DVDs. Each episode includes 5-10 minutes of outtakes and deleted scenes.--Shane BurnettNorthern Exposure - The Complete Second SeasonThe colorful cast of characters from Cicely, Alaska, returns for a new set of adventures inNorthern Exposure: The Complete Second Season. While much of the first season was devoted to establishing the plot, each of the seven episodes in season 2 helps us to know the offbeat ensemble of Cicely residents a little better. Dr. Joel Fleischman (Rob Morrow), the New York urbanite stationed in small-town Alaska to pay off his medical-school tuition, still complains constantly about his assignment, but it's clear the town's growing on him when he passes up an opportunity to return home (if only temporarily). We learn from town patriarch Maurice (Barry Corbin) that retired astronauts have groupies, and when a beautiful woman steals the voice of DJ \"Chris in the Morning\" (John Corbett), it's no huge surprise when the long-deceased spirit of \"One Who Waits\" provides Chris with an ancient Indian cure.But it's the chemistry between Joel and Maggie (Janine Turner) that really makes the series sizzle. The season is book-ended by a pair of breakups that leave first Joel, and then Maggie single, clearing the way for the romance to come in later seasons. The season includes \"Spring Break,\" one of the best-loved episodes from the series. With the impending arrival of spring, libidos run amok, a wave of petty crime hits the town, and the men in town blow off steam au naturale in the annual \"Running of the Bulls.\"Season 2's packaging and extras are virtually identical to those from season 1. The two-disc set comes sheathed in a collectible mini zippered nylon \"parka,\" and each episode includes deleted scenes and bloopers. There are no retrospectives or interviews with cast and crew, and no printed materials accompany the discs.--Shane Burnett", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00FWMVVK4", "B00FWMVVI6", "B00FWMVVKY", "B00FWMVVHC", "B000002OMG", "1417029854", "B000002OT2", "B000K7VHJ6", "0809237628", "B000V6LSO0", "0809237601", "B00DSCB7Q8", "B0017KP8Y0", "B006WK4Y6I", "B000TGURZ8", "B00005JOXR", "B000BGR1B4", "B00EQ2KU7G", "B00369ERC4", "B001DHXT52", "B000NDEXO8", "B006WK4Y8Q", "B000NTMA1U", "B001U9BS2O", "B0055733I4", "B001DMVZJ4", "B000MEYKA0", "B00D2UMHVA", "B004O9WK9W", "B0013LRKQC", "B000EOTUTE", "B0035JHYQG", "B000UX6THK", "B001D2WUDE", "B00GOC74QG", "B001JFKWE4", "B000BF0C8E", "B000EQ5UUA", "B0013LRKVC", "B0013XZ6TI", "B000ERVJKO", "B000XJD3K2", "1435458443", "B000HT3P56", "B000AP31KQ", "B00A92ME5S", "B000LE16XA", "B008FTWT70", "B001DJLCRC", "B001F7AQDS", "B00GHH9HW2", "B000244E2O", "B000053VB4", "B00004ZEU2", "B003YLM78U", "B001CQONNQ", "B0016OMFO8", "B008KEQLZ6", "B000XCZGW2", "B000Q6GUS4", "B000LXGXY8", "B0058EE6NK", "B001BN4WK4", "B000N2HD6O", "B005BUA1JY", "B00A27O0N4", "B001RTSPVY", "B00I4581F4", "B00008KA5A", "B00IFK7OFG", "B000H7JCJQ", "B00FPPQYXM", "B000EHRVOW", "B00BUWD7Y8", "B0077PAPD8", "B009LDD1X0", "B000YKYT1M", "1569759766", "B000BZISRG", "B00E3QJ8DC", "B000MXPE6U", "B000PGUT8C", "B0092QH902", "B00BUWD7E8", "B001XRLWPQ", "B001E6JC30", "B00F1BFRA6", "B000NA21YA", "B00GLT2TR6", "B000B91N3S", "B00CL151G4", "B0002DRDY6", "B00DYQ1G78", "B00BM2JVAA", "B0000AQS0F"], "bought_together": ["B00FWMVVK4", "B00FWMVVI6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B006WK4Y6I", "B006WK4Y8Q", "B00FWMVVK4", "B00FWMVVI6"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 23298}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 32.99, "brand": "UNI DIST CORP.

{"description": "Shinichiro Watanabe'sfilm noir-ish sci-fi adventureCowboy Bebopset a new standard for cool in anime in 1998, andSamurai Champloo, an edgy mix of Edo-era martial arts and hip-hop irreverence, is a worthy follow-up. A string of coincidences brings together three misfits in a two-bit tea house: Mugen, a rebellious vagabond; Jin, a taciturn ronin; and Fuu, a nutty waitress. The sardonic Mugen lacks the polish that distinguishes a classic martial artist--he uses break dance spins and flips against his foes. Jin moves with a polish that approaches iciness: When he unsheathes his sword, he becomes a lethal work of art in motion. Fuu forces Jin and Mugen to help her find a mysterious samurai \"who smells of sun flowers.\" As the ill-assorted trio wanders towards Nagasaki, Watanabe treats the audiences to a string of&#xA0;outrageous, anachronistic adventures. In Episode 18, Mugen belatedly learns to read at a smackdown elementary school, while Jin tries to settle the rivalry between the heirs to the dojo of his former sensei. The seemingly unrelated storylines collide in a no-holds-barred graffiti contest featuring Tokugawa rap lyrics, ink-brush tagging, Hiroshima homeboys, and a caricature of Andy Warhol.  But Watanabe reveals the hidden significance of these nutty interludes when he brings his picaresque adventure-comedy to a close. LikeCowboy Bebop,Samurai Champlooleaves the viewer wanting more.

Dio has been hailed as one of the finest voices in Heavy Metal for over 30 years now, and for good reason.

The census taker becomes trapped in this prison-like town full of \"golden rules\" (that no one ever breaks) that doesn't allow its population to drop below or exceed exactly 436 citizens, a number in accordance with \"God's Law.\" He eventually learns that NO ONE is ever allowed to leave Rockwell Falls and that the town citizens will do whatever it takes to maintain the status quo.

{"description": "Numb3rs' intriguing and entertaining mix of prime-time crime action and mathematics gets its sophomore showcase in this impressive six-disc boxed set, which brings together the entire second season with a fun and informative array of extras. Season Two brings about a slight changing of the guard in the show's cast: Gone is Sabrina Lloyd as Agent Terry Lake, and in her place are Diane Farr (Rescue Me) as Agent Megan Reeves and Dylan Bruno as Agent Colby Granger, both of whom assimilate quite smoothly intoNumb3rs' blend of detective work and academics. Otherwise it's business as usual with the Eppes boys, with big brother Don (Rob Morrow) leading his team against all manner of nefarious types, and genius younger sibling Charlie (David Krumholtz) finding answers in the web of mathematical equations he stores in his head. Highlights for the season include \"All's Fair,\" which offers both the murder of a documentarian investigating Muslim women's rights and a rekindled love affair for Charlie; \"Mind Games,\" which pits Charlie against a psychic (John Glover) who tracks down three missing women; and \"Toxin,\" which features a return guest appearance by Lou Diamond Phillips as Special Agent Ian Edgerton.Extras include commentary on seven episodes by members of the cast and crew, including co-creator Nicolas Falacci; also interesting is \"CrunchingNumb3rs: Season Two,\" which offers a half-hour look behind the scenes at the making of the episode \"Rampage,\" and David Krumholtz's video diary, for which the actor brings the audience along for a day on the set. A blooper reel and gallery of stills shot by Falacci round out the supplemental features.-- Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000SO7PBU", "B000ERVJKE", "B001AZIRZ4", "B001G0MFME", "B003FSTN84", "0452288576", "B00KHA9BQ2", "B000LE178Y", "B00CD45JBG", "B0002DRE72", "B00DI013EG", "B003UD7J26", "B005PYKNJY", "B0053O89IS", "B001G0MFLA", "B003VTKZA2", "B002BWP2JO", "B004T0XYKA", "B00H4ZEJ6K", "B005PYKVRI", "B003R0MF0S", "B003TFAJ18", "B003FSTN5C", "B001OQCVCY", "B003FSTN6G", "B003R0MEZ4", "B000SO7PCE", "B005QET8FS", "B003L77G8I", "B009LDD4V4", "B009LDD1H6", "B00ESK1PES", "B000SQFC40", "B003L77G2E", "B00915G6MG", "B00CYQXH4O", "B004UXVDOA", "B0013DZNAA", "B001BL6QE6", "B001G0MFKQ", "B003L77G1K", "B00B9UEOPC", "B003Q7B7B0", "B0053O8AKU", "B002N5N4NA", "B004HW7JQU", "B007ZXW3SM", "B003L77H2I", "B0058YPJOU", "B000B5XOVQ", "B000B8I9ZO", "B001992NWO", "B009LDCZYQ", "B003L77H0A", "B001E6JC1M", "B001L1S1OY", "B004QXJZXK", "B002JVWR4A", "B000MGBSIK", "B00915G6OE", "B000RO6JYK", "B00064VQXA", "B00EIXWMII", "B001G0MFL0", "B000HT3P60", "B0094UOI64", "B0058YPILY", "B001AI776G", "B000H7JCEG", "B00GTZWUPS", "B000GBEWSO", "B009RX7IX8", "B005PYL8VQ", "B000B8IA08", "B00915G6NK", "B00188XHF8", "B000H7JCE6", "B002BWP2IK", "B0058YPI5K", "B00CL151G4", "B005PYL4VU", "B003R0MF08", "B004UXVDJA", "B0039N74WC", "B00B58948U", "B0053O89KG", "B000SQFC1S", "B000UAE7QI", "B0081QF6Q8", "B005PPMHO2", "B003R4ZMPE", "B002ZHKZFQ", "B00D6I7GHS", "B000LE16XA", "B00915G6Q2", "B001CQONKY", "B000H7JCHS", "B00HRUQ9BA", "B00BR6RVEY", "B004X60QE2"], "bought_together": ["B000ERVJKE", "B000SO7PBU"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003N0QF1W", "B000ERVJKE", "B003FSTN84", "B000SO7PBU"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 71926}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 20.11, "brand": "Paramount Pictures", "asin": "B000GG4Y5K", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51G7BGD58EL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Numb3rs - The Complete Second Season"}
{"description": "The second season of the bizarre MTV2 seriesWonder Showzenis not exactly a rehash of season one; it's more like a ramped-up version of the same stuff that was such a cruelly hilarious invention of a children's puppet/variety show from hell. The same warning about it not being a kids' show precedes each episode, with the material following more lunatic, more self-reflexive, and way more not-for-kids than the stuff remembered by those who fell in love withWonder Showzenfor exactly those reasons. The eight episodes and smattering of bonus materials are presented in a fun kid's book rip-off cardboard case, complete with a \"storybook\" that has nothing to do with the episodes, but everything to do with the psychotic antics and fuzzy characters returning that populate the show. A sampling of the bigger-budgeted episodes include \"Body,\" in which the letter P gets fat, turns into the letter B, then gets liposuction to improve her self-esteem. It's no surprise when the puppetted, sucked-out excess fat gains self-awareness. There's also \"Cooperation,\" in which fake bootlegged versions ofWonder Showzenbattle it out using the same theme and sketch outlines simultaneously in the four corners of the screen. Another episode is entirely devoted to a take off on \"Hee Haw\" called \"Horse Apples\" which gleefully tromps all over \"Middle America\" (a.k.a. Texas) and right-wing conservative values. The \"Horse Apples\" thing pops up in another episode, and is explored more fully in some of the off the wall bonus material. The final episode of the season is an analysis of TV in which Chauncey asks people on the street what kinds of shows they would make. Some care and some don't, which pretty much sums up how people will feel aboutWonder Showzenitself as television. Only two of the episodes have commentary tracks, but the show's creators do not speak on them; they're the real thoughts of actual scientists talking about the physics of time travel and the morality of genocide. Funny!--Ted Fry", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000CSUNMK", "B002GSXKRO", "B0014FAIWU", "B00C6QT4CQ", "B002RFX9Y0", "1934734918", "B0069R250G", "B0048LPRDC", "B002VWNIDQ", "B000CQQID0", "B000M341RS", "B00L3PA8P8", "B000CSUNJ8", "B00FXOO1AS", "B0000AQS89", "B000GG4Y14", "B00097DY2U", "B00J48K5IG", "B000FO0AG0", "B000RZIGYA", "B001G0MFFG", "B00069L0Z4", "B001EOQVA4", "B004RCGQSC", "B0001MZ7K0", "B000ARXF7I", "B00274SITW", "B0056EBHW0", "B0002WZRSG", "B000FZETJS", "B00113YHXG", "B004L9GLM2", "B0007CILMK", "B000H5U6HK", "B000RZGHT6", "B00267N3EU", "B00JH4U9GK", "B00INLE540", "B00116GEKW", "B00JDB4DV4", "B003NF97NU", "B00AIANIPQ", "B001J4E1C4", "B000PAAJZG", "B00005LQ0T", "B0002WZRTU", "B001G7Q640", "B000F9T700", "B00JAQJNN0", "B000KWZ1PC", "B0081QCZGC", "B001053088", "B007CU8P8K", "B004QLX0TM", "1493696661", "B003IJ72WY", "B0007CILMA", "B000VWX6SA", "B00330WP6Q", "B0057ZAA6W", "B00HHYF5DY", "B0002YCVY2", "B000GIXLWA", "B002OID4WM", "B006KCZBK6", "B007VI658A", "B009LA4P6U", "B0083XXWRE", "B0002RQ3M0", "B000B5XOR0", "159307963X", "157362408X", "B000P2A6CA", "1593078226", "B0010XB1WM", "B00BHUJ2XI", "B004GSVX6M", "B009B8YNGO", "B0017RFXJI", "B002WJHDJI", "B00008PHCU", "1616552379", "B001AII4WM", "B001LXDGQK", "B0001MZ7KA", "B004MA1K1M", "B00DNQCH0Y", "B000S0GYRU", "B005CHTXWC", "B00363WGB4", "B0007TKGW6", "B00ENNA62W", "B002RS7ND0", "B0038M61D2", "B002SF9YSE", "B00317LM8S", "B000FZETK2", "B000HC2OBO", "B00GHH9IIA", "B000RZIGX6"], "bought_together": ["B000CSUNMK", "B002GSXKRO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000CSUNMK", "B002GSXKRO", "B0048LPRDC", "B00C6QT4CQ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 97035}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 16.02, "brand": "Unknown", "asin": "B000GG4Y1Y", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514g15QeZPL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Wonder Showzen - Season Two"}

{"description": "Forget any off-screen impressions you may have of Mel Gibson, and experience Apocalypto as the mad, bloody runaway train that it is. The story is set in the pre-Columbian Maya population: one village is brutally overrun, its residents either slaughtered or abducted, by a ruling tribe that needs slaves and human sacrifices. We focus on the capable warrior Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood), although Gibson skillfully sketches a whole population of characters--many of whom don't survive the early reels. Most of the film is set in the dense jungle, but the middle section, in a grand Mayan city, is a dazzling triumph of design, costuming, and sheer decadent terror. The movie itself is a triumph of brutality, as Gibson lets loose his well-established fascination with bodily mortification in a litany of assaults including impalement, evisceration, snakebite, and bee stings. It's a dark, disgusted vision, but Gibson doesn't forget to apply some very canny moviemaking instincts to the violence--including the creation of a tremendous pair of villains (strikingly played by Raoul Trujillo and Rodolfo Palacias). The film is in a Maya dialect, subtitled in English, and shot on digital video (which occasionally betrays itself in some blurry quick pans). Amidst all the mayhem, nothing in the film is more devastating than a final wordless exchange of looks between captured villager Blunted (Jonathan Brewer) and his wife's mother (Maria Isabel Diaz), a superb change in tone from their early relationship. Yes, this is an obsessive, crazed movie, but Gibson knows what he's doing. --Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000UVV24M", "B0012Q732O", "B00003CXAF", "B001BNFRB2", "B000VMIILU", "1573623903", "B002O3Z50Q", "B00004XPPG", "6305692688", "B00028HBKM", "B00004RJ71", "B00AEFXKUI", "B002ZG999U", "B0002YLCG0", "B000VKL6ZM", "B002T9H2LA", "B0000542C6", "B0001CNQX0", "B00AEFY5B6", "B00006ADD5", "B00406UK7S", "B004AOECXI", "B004SIP8W0", "B000R9U3B0", "B00008G8LY", "B00001ZWUS", "B000MGB6NM", "B003EYVXXW", "6304711905", "B004HO6HWA", "B000QXDED6", "B0034G4P58", "B0000714BS", "B000XR9L50", "B00005JLQT", "0783230389", "B002VWNIEA", "B00AZNEW5G", "B008MIMWQW", "B003VA3JZY", "B0002DRDIW", "B000AARKOO", "B00BEJL6JK", "B004SIP7TE", "079283366X", "B00005V9HH", "B000M341QE", "B003HKN52U", "B005IUIXCE", "B00275EGWY", "B003UYUQZW", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B002O3Z510", "B002Q4VBPQ", "B002WY65VU", "B000I0RNWU", "B00003CXWV", "B002XMGGK6", "B003NF97NK", "B000QXDCJ2", "B001FB5634", "B001DZOC6Y", "B007STBUHI", "B0000VCZMK", "B0013FDM7E", "B00015YVDG", "B003IY498Y", "6305433925", "B000P0J0AG", "B00005K3NR", "B000O76ZQC", "B003ELKNH2", "B00018D3ZA", "6304821832", "B00AEBBA36", "B009YQJ322", "B00005JL3T", "079284646X", "B002CA68MU", "B00BTYJYR6", "B00AEFYE08", "B000P0J09C", "B005LAIHPE", "B00441GZ1Y", "B001OQCV2E", "B00AEFY0F2", "B000BITV9W", "B004LWZW4M", "B005LAIIRQ", "B00003CXBH", "B000A2WP7O", "B001GCUO0W", "B00005JPD0", "B00AMSLDTM", "B000RTB0R6", "B00005JA8B", "B00009PY4G", "0783226039", "B000B8QG22", "B000069I1I"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001BNFRB2", "B00028HBKM", "B00001ZWUS", "B00004XPPG"]}, "price": 10.55, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 53938}, "asin": "B000GNOKQG", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41yXQu76-NL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Apocalypto (2006) (2007) Rudy Youngblood; Raoul Trujillo; Mel Gibson"}
{"description": "Lo and behold,Clerks IIdefies the odds as a sequel that even the most ardentClerksfans can be happy about. Twelve years after Kevin Smith turned the independent film world upside-down with his $27,000 black-and-white comedy, perpetual slackers Dante (Brian O'Halloran) and Randal (Jeff Anderson) return for another raucous romp in suburbia, but this time there's no beloved Quick Stop mini-mart to ensure their low-level employment. Now they're aimless 33-year-olds flippin' burgers at Mooby's, a fast-food joint with a cow theme that's \"udderly delicious.\" Dante's engaged to his long-time girlfriend but has unexpectedly fallen in love with Mooby's manager Becky (and since she's played by Rosario Dawson, can you blame him?), and Randal's still holding out for life, liberty, and the pursuit of low ambition. The responsibilities of adulthood are rearing their ugly head, and with Jay and Silent Bob (Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith) still dealing weed and generally being obnoxious, well... something's gotta give, right? The way Smith has written this long-awaited follow-up, the dilemmas of Dante, Randal, and their ongoing friendship are something that anyone can relate to, and with Dawson lighting up the screen (in a role demanded by producer Harvey Weinstein to boost box-office appeal), the movie's romantic chemistry is surprisingly delightful. Rest assured, also, that Smith (shooting mostly in color this time, on a $5 million budget) hasn't forgotten where he came from:Clerks IIis jam-packed with the same lewd, crude humor that madeClerksan indie-film phenomenon, and Smith's good-natured sincerity is still on full display, ensuring that only the most prudish viewers could possibly be offended. For everyone else, this is as enjoyable as any sequel could ever hope to be, with amusing cameos by Smith-movie veterans Ben Affleck and Jason Lee, among others.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004SIP6LS", "B00000IQW4", "B004SIP8ES", "B004XVMCH6", "B007D0FUTG", "B00003CWOL", "B004U7MQW4", "B001KKU9DW", "B005FUTBWS", "B0016MJ6GA", "B00007149S", "B000CPH9PM", "B004SIP6N6", "B001CDFY4Q", "B000I0QLOQ", "B000ICL3L0", "B000EMGJAO", "1592406890", "B001OD4S50", "B000JJ4DNW", "B00068WOH8", "B0018BZEOC", "B005G5NPLA", "B0023TCWE8", "B00363WGBO", "B0002V7TMY", "B007D0FVYA", "B00003CXPS", "B000A7DVR2", "B001J9KJ4I", "0783230338", "B000BBOUCC", "B00009MGEM", "B000093FLA", "B005J9ZFQG", "B000031EFY", "B001C0JCBA", "B006WXHJLC", "B00029LO5E", "B001MFNB58", "0783227434", "B002ZG96ZC", "0800141687", "B008220BGQ", "B00007AJGM", "B0050PYNP8", "B00441GYVA", "B000M9CB4W", "1592407447", "B00BEIYH1A", "B00AEFXVW0", "B000WC3864", "B00AEFZ7F4", "B003VPX5Y4", "0767837398", "B005LAII12", "B000BYA5G4", "B009AMALGM", "B000AARKXA", "B00003CXS7", "B000GBEWGQ", "B000AXWHSA", "B004QL7K70", "0783229526", "B00005JN2Z", "B002O3Z4VG", "B00B4VSUBK", "B000WZEZGI", "B000VXWX7E", "B002ZG97XI", "B00BPEJWAE", "B008RNYMG0", "184856497X", "B00860YIJU", "B004SIP8ZM", "B004EPZ084", "B004SIP9Z6", "B00008975Z", "B00005JM23", "B000IZJZIU", "B003Y5H5C4", "B006TTC50Y", "B004SEUJFK", "B00E1HIX66", "B00005JKMN", "B00005JKHP", "B000069CF0", "B00007ELER", "B009DA743Y", "B001G5T6GW", "B00004TJMW", "B0006HBZE2", "B00005JNZU", "B00029RTAI", "B004UXUWEC", "B0018RKEQE", "6305551235", "B007WW94TW"], "bought_together": ["B004SIP6LS", "B00000IQW4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004SIP6LS", "B00000IQW4", "B0016MJ6GA", "B004SIP8ES"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 14519}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.25, "brand": "Weinstein Company", "asin": "B000I0RNVQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51tIUlFx1EL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Clerks II (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "A disturbing film about a recovering drug addict trying to regain control of her life,Sherrybabysuccinctly depicts what can happen when want and desire aren't offset by control. In this bleak indie film, Sherry Swanson (Maggie Gyllenhaal,Stranger Than Fiction,Secretary) has just been released from a three-year stint in prison. Dressed in her inappropriate uniform of a halter top and oh-so-high platform heels, she goes to brother's house to see her 5-year-old daughter, Lexie (Ryan Simpkins). Sherry is determined to be a mother to her child, but without a home, job, or any other form of stability, she grows frustrated and jealous of her brother and sister-in-law's roles in Lexie's life. Tall and willowy, Gyllenhaal brings a sad desperation and simmering sexuality to the role. Sherry's middle-class childhood was a blur of sex and drugs, and she seems incapable of breaking out of that destructive trap. While the script by first-time feature film director Laurie Collyer isn't wholly original, the picture moves at a good pace, giving insight as to why Sherry's resigned to using sex to get what she wants. While the family secret doesn't come as a complete surprise, it is somewhat perplexing that no one addresses it. Ultimately, it's Gyllenhaal who makes you care about a character that most people would've given up on.--Jae-Ha Kim", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000I0QL7I", "B0007CEXYK", "B000E6ESU8", "B00008MTXI", "B0006IIKRG", "B000LAZDPG", "6305692572", "B00004UEDQ", "B00A2H9QN8", "B000ERVK4Y", "B003YKYX9M", "B00005JM23", "B0045HCJ08", "B003Y5H59C", "B00005Q4CS", "B000Z3N1HQ", "6305162026", "B0017X1WGK", "6305594333", "B001E95ZNS", "B007VI5AQ8", "B00JAGF9HE", "B0052ADP6Y", "B0000549B1", "B000BBOUUE", "B003AC98V2", "B00009Y3QI", "B00EUENWIY", "B00049QQHI", "B002UNMWTC", "B004V4RW8O", "B000GB5M3S", "B000J10F8C", "B00005JH9M", "0578045427", "0792838068", "B0039Y774Q", "B0000ZMGWK", "B000XSKDBA", "B0015VQAZM", "B007TSV4GK", "B003JO6OPO", "B004SUDQC2", "B001CRC4DG", "B0050ODZ6M", "B00005JMIJ", "B00ET2ODTE", "B000ICL3NI", "B00023P4I8", "B00008972P", "B00005JMU1", "B0002KPIQY", "B0040J1RX6", "B00GRZPRB4", "B00AFEXRME", "B000PKG8TM", "B000N3SU92", "B00HOGBXS6", "B004QL7JYO", "B0006IIPLM", "B00641Y2ZS", "B0000DBJ8B", "B00INUK5WM", "B00K0MM4AM", "B006GL8NQ0", "B0016I0AKU", "B00005JKN2", "B001CC7PRQ", "B000LC3I9W", "B00000IBL1", "B001C5LLVE", "B0009GX1XI", "B001FRNB9E", "B001PPLJIQ", "B006M3M5FM", "B001URA5Y8", "B0029Z8K74", "B00EMAGKNU", "B00013RC2K", "B004YCKKFK", "B004L3AR0K", "B00AEFXJ86", "B000067IZ3", "B002Q3MZXE", "B00JPSYPCM", "B001AIQ14A", "B00005U14H", "B003Z8ZC2A", "B00IARA89S", "B0010DM3R4", "B0015XHQXU", "B000FTCF3G", "B00005QJIG", "B000TLTCQI", "B004RD3YFE", "B00114XTHA", "076782170X", "B000EZ9084", "B0057ZAA6W"], "bought_together": ["B0007CEXYK", "B000I0QL7I"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000I0QL7I", "6305692572", "B00008MTXI", "B0007CEXYK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 28252}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.25, "brand": "Universal Studios", "asin": "B000JBXXYK", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516NtGsG%2BnL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Sherrybaby"}
{"description": "The moving biblical tale of Esther--a humble Jewish girl who saved her people from annihilation and won the heart of the handsome Persian king Xerxes--is the subject ofOne Night with the King, a lush ode to one of the Old Testament's most inspiring women. Esther, played with spark and confidence by Tiffany Dupont, could perhaps be said to be the first career woman to \"have it all\"--while also serving her people, and God. The film, shot on location in India, has the feel of the great epics of the '60s--a sensation underscored by the appearance, in small but pivotal roles, of both Omar Sharif and Peter O'Toole. (EvenRaiders of the Lost Ark's John Rhys-Davies--\"Bad dates!\"--echoes earlier desert adventures.) But the film belongs to the willful Esther, who navigates among war, bloodlust, persecution, and terror with the strength of knowing she's serving the Lord, and her people.

{"description": "Pile together a blue-ribbon cast, a screenplay high in quirkiness, and the Sundance stamp of approval, and youve got yourself a crossover indie hit. That formula worked for Little Miss Sunshine, a frequently hilarious study of family dysfunction. Meet the Hoovers, an Albuquerque clan riddled with depression, hostility, and the tattered remnants of the American Dream; despite their flakiness, they manage to pile into a VW van for a weekend trek to L.A. in order to get moppet daughter Olive (Abigail Breslin) into the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant. Much of the pleasure of this journey comes from watching some skillful comic actors doing their thing: Greg Kinnear and Toni Collette as the parents (hes hoping to become a self-help authority), Alan Arkin as a grandfather all too willing to give uproariously inappropriate advice to a sullen teenage grandson (Paul Dano), and a subdued Steve Carell as a jilted gay professor on the verge of suicide. The film is a crowd-pleaser, and if anything is a little too eager to bend itself in the direction of quirk-loving Sundance audiences; it can feel forced. But the breezy momentum and the ingenious actors help push the material over any bumps in the road. -- Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000YABYLA", "B00005JMJG", "B001UV4XGU", "B00A81MV3U", "B00DL46ZN8", "B00005JNC2", "B0007TKOAA", "B001UV4XUG", "B00005ALS0", "B00118T632", "B00AEFXESQ", "B007L6VR12", "B008220BA2", "B003L20ICE", "B0000640VJ", "B008OHV49W", "B001P9KR8U", "B000A7DVR2", "B00000F5MN", "B007L6VRBM", "B00AFEY354", "B0001GOH6Q", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00337KM2S", "B000H0MKOC", "B004UXUX4Q", "B0034G4OZE", "B00011CZRE", "B00275EGWY", "0205751989", "B000FVQLQQ", "B0010X8NF0", "B004SIP95G", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B004QL7KKC", "B00079Z9VO", "B00003CXZ4", "B0021L8UOY", "B001MM3AZM", "B0057ZAA6W", "B00606P0BM", "B00005Q4CS", "B00ADRYCWC", "B001TOD92C", "B004SEUIW4", "B000P0J0EW", "B0015OKWKI", "B000CS464G", "B0007PLLBU", "B00009W5CA", "B00005JLSB", "B004A8ZWV0", "B007RKFXUS", "B0010AN7Z4", "B00012QLB4", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B003UESJH4", "B00005JNBQ", "B007VYE4PK", "B000WZEZGI", "B00AEBB9F0", "6304907729", "B003Y5H574", "B000SFOW8I", "B00005JMJ4", "B001BL96K2", "B00006FMUW", "B002VPTJOA", "B00003CXO1", "B000J103OI", "B0038N9WKU", "B00AEBB9CS", "B00008975Z", "B003ASLJQI", "B0049985XW", "B003ASLJO0", "B001J9KJ4I", "B001FZQOW2", "B00000G02H", "1557047707", "B000BYRCQU", "B00121QGPY", "B00005JL57", "B000021Y77", "B000A3XY5A", "B000MZHW40", "B0000AC8LR", "B00AEFY0KW", "B0045HCJ9E", "B002Q4VBPQ", "B00AEBB9FA", "B00005A06N", "B000ELJAEM", "B00AEFYAMA", "B00E8RKHWW", "B00005JLRE", "B005LAIHE0", "B000M341QE", "B0039UT3LK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00118T632", "B00DL46ZN8", "B0007UC8Y4", "B001AGXEAG"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 401537}, "asin": "B000JU9OJ4", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51T7A7BDBWL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Little Miss Sunshine [Region 2]"}
{"description": "Out patrolling a California highway, police officer Edward Malus (Nicolas Cage) stops a station wagon to return a little girl's lost doll. Moments later, a runaway truck slams into the station wagon, igniting it into a fiery wreck with the mother and child trapped inside. Edward fails to save them before the car explodes...and then spends months of his life choking down pills to get the image of their faces out of his head. But Edward is about to get a second chance. A desperate letter from his former girlfriend, Willow (Kate Beahan), arrives at his home with no postmark. Willow came into his life and left just as unexpectedly years before. But now, her daughter Rowan has gone missing, and Edward is theonly person she trusts to help locate her. She asks him to come to her home on a private island - Summersisle - a place with its own traditions where people observe a forgotten way of life. Edward seizes the opportunity to make his life right again, and soon finds himself on a seaplane bound for the islands of the Pacific Northwest. But nothing is what it seems on isolated Summersisle, where a culture, dominated by its matriarch Sister Summersisle (Ellen Burstyn), is bound together by arcane traditions and a pagan festival called \"the Day of Death and Rebirth.\" The secretive people of Summersisle only ridicule his investigation, insisting that a child named Rowan never existed there... or if she ever did was no longer alive. But what Edward doesn't know is that Willow's plea for help has invited more into his life than a chance for redemption. In unraveling Summersisle's closely held secrets, Edward is drawn into a web of ancient traditions and murderous deceit, and each step he takes closer to the lost child brings him one step closer to the unspeakable. And one step closer to the Wicker Man.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001J710Y8", "B000PMFRZQ", "B002TVQ48K", "B000GRUMRS", "B0073U2ETK", "B001J710Z2", "B004EPYZOO", "B00012QLB4", "B000TGJ8CQ", "B001KRVLCI", "B000CSUNQQ", "B001GCUO02", "B00AEBB8JM", "B000CFYAMC", "6304806434", "B004XFZ4JK", "B000OVLBF8", "B000BBOUW2", "B000BYA5G4", "B000059TG6", "B004EI2NMM", "B00BFNJHCI", "B00004Z4WR", "B001KKU9CI", "0792838068", "6304711891", "B003ZD9DSO", "B00BJB2GZG", "B00003CXIV", "6305760403", "B00BTYMPX6", "B000U7169M", "B00IKM5LXG", "B001DZOC6Y", "B007IUEEA2", "B00062IDGK", "B00003CXXG", "B003YF9PX6", "B00092ZLSK", "B00005JLRE", "B000TJ6PBK", "B00441GZ00", "B005F2JRUC", "0792844831", "B000FI8MPW", "B0000AGWMF", "B00005JN5E", "0767810856", "B000YNFXZA", "B000OVLBGM", "B00006LPGP", "B00020HAX8", "B0010YVCB6", "B0009X763M", "B00005JP3R", "B000RZGHSM", "B000EHRVP6", "B00008L3UF", "B000286S1U", "B00DNJ95S8", "B009L79YFU", "B00KCTG4PO", "B005DR64OQ", "B0019X3YX2", "B000RZGHSW", "B00406UK7S", "B000JLTRIQ", "B003UMW63O", "B0047T74CM", "B000ALM40I", "B008XAT0TQ", "B002GHHHKG", "B009XTF8KQ", "B001OST0M6", "B009IV2Z3M", "B002ZG99KO", "B00E8G5HNM", "B0002DB5PO", "B00HOGBXS6", "B008DVJOQ4", "B004SIP92O", "B00AEBBA2W", "B00I9H3VTS", "B0011NVC98", "B001JNNDJM", "B000W1SZA4", "B00FEHCQEC", "B00AEFYYH6", "B005LAIGW8", "B00005JNNT", "B004CQZFH6", "B000U1ZV62", "B000RGN2JI", "B003L20IEW", "B00006FDBT", "B00004Y87O", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00803PFZO", "B00GOYC3I8"], "bought_together": ["B001J710Y8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001J710Y8", "B00004Z4WR", "B002TVQ48K", "B000PMFRZQ"]}, "price": 9.33, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 75218}, "asin": "B000JYW5DM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51TT3AM10VL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Wicker Man (Full Screen Unrated/Rated Edition)"}

{"description": "Growing up can be a confusing journey fraught with difficult choices.  Boog (Martin Lawrence) is a domesticated Grizzly Bear who leads a perfectly happy life inside of Park Ranger Beth's (Debra Messing) garage, but a chance meeting with an overly energetic mule deer named Elliot (Ashton Kutcher) quickly changes everything and lands Boog high in the forest a few days before the opening of hunting season.  Devoid of even the most basic survival skills, Boog and Elliot stumble through the woods and find themselves at the mercy of every forest animal from skunks to chipmunks as well as an evil hunter named Shaw (Gary Sinise).  After unintentionally inciting and endangering an entire forest full of clever animals, Boog and Elliot come to the realization that only by banding together do the forest animals stand a chance of outsmarting the hunters and ensuring their own survival.This first animated film from Sony Pictures Animation takes its inspiration from cartoonist Steve Moore(In the Bleachers)and features animals with human-like intelligence, a vibrant color palate, and skilled animation that makes everything from the wind blowing Boo's fur to the animals' wild trip down the falls simply breathtaking.  While it doesn't quite live up toOver the Hedge,Open Seasonis an entertaining production that explores the difficult process of maturation, the universal need for acceptance, and the true value of friendship.  Special features include a 15-minute featurette about the animation process at Sony Pictures Animation and Image Works, a 7-minute look at the recording sessions featuring the voices behind the characters, two deleted scenes, three short animated cartoon strips, a short \"Boog and Elliot's Midnight Bun Run\" that's an extension of the trailer scene in the movie, art gallery, beat boards, humorous commentary from the animals' point of views, and a full length commentary by Producer Michelle Murdocca, Directors Roger Allers and Jill Culton, and others.  Activities include a \"Voice-A-Rama\" where viewers can hear specific lines spoken by alternate voices and a trivia \"Wheel of Fortune--Forest Edition\" as well as a DVD-ROM link to more online fun.

{"description": "Celtic Woman, the PBS sensation, returns for 2007 inA New Journey: Live at Slane Castle, Ireland.  Most of the elements return as well: vocalists Chloe, Meav, Lisa, and Orla; fiery fiddler Mairead; music director David Downes; chorus and orchestra; and the New Age-y Celtic and traditional music.  New for this show is New Zealand vocalist Hayley Westenra, a picturesque outdoor location, and an almost entirely new song list.  Chloe sings \"The Prayer\" (made famous by Josh Groban) and \"Panis Angelicus\"; Lisa covers \"Caledonia,\" \"The Blessing,\" and \"The Voice\"; Orla sings \"Newgrange\" and accompanies herself on harp for \"Carrickfergus\"; Meav sings \"Dulaman\"; Mairead plays \"Granuaile's Dance\" and \"Shenandoah: The Pacific Slope\"; and Hayley sings \"Scarborough Fair\" by herself and duets with Mairead (Handel's \"Lascia Ch'io Pianga\") and Meav (\"The Last Rose of Summer\").  Then of course the group performs together (\"The Sky and the Dawn and the Sun,\" \"Over the Rainbow,\" \"Beyond the Sea,\" \"At the Ceili,\" \"Sing Out!\", \"Spanish Lady,\" \"Mo Ghile Mear\").  Encore performances from the original show are Enya's \"Orinoco Flow,\" \"Danny Boy,\" \"Somewhere,\" and \"You Raise Me Up.\"  Hayley proves to be an excellent fit among the beautiful voices, and Lisa seems to emerge as the talent most deserving of attention, but overall the show lacks some of the fresh sparkle of the original.  The song list isn't quite as strong, and some of the \"primp and pose\" choreography is just silly.  ButCeltic Womanis never less than charming, and at its best can be quite stirring.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002UZXJAG", "B005RYF5JA", "B0007M22TI", "B00HGGUS4O", "B00EZRY62C", "B001KKU982", "B00HF95OMI", "B000UPWO5E", "B002UZXJA6", "B005RYF5H2", "B0007GAEGC", "B000KRNCYY", "B000PUB4FA", "B00HF95PA4", "B000CNF4LA", "B004DMAZQA", "B001KKSDKS", "B00EZPCYFU", "B007W38WQ2", "B00EZPCWKM", "B004G8LKBU", "B000I2ISF4", "B00AX5B0QU", "B000CNF4L0", "B000CNF4KG", "B00152PFAM", "B006PF64AO", "B002AK9UUO", "B0046M4H7K", "B000ZOT8NG", "B0007VCUGO", "B005DETYW8", "B000929UNM", "B001BBOSB4", "B0010V4TTQ", "B003019LWY", "B00DD348M2", "B001Q8FSWU", "B00000K32N", "B0012OTVRG", "B00HZ9IDKS", "B00FLUD46Q", "B000MTDRJA", "B00005NGAK", "B002RV01QI", "B0040VJTX4", "B00BCM2F3U", "073904947X", "B006PF627O", "B00DBO1YYI", "B005GP7ENU", "B002JNYMLO", "B005X5XIL0", "B0006OG572", "B0001FVDQO", "B000CNF4LU", "B004G8LKBA", "B004DQMSM0", "B00EV1D4IY", "B002AK9UTU", "B0091V6SKK", "B001I5M9SC", "B00005NGAE", "B000KN7BYA", "B00000FC34", "0739067206", "B00AX5B0QA", "B00005R872", "0739088610", "B00152IAIQ", "B004SKQAJI", "B0012OTVR6", "B003019LWO", "B000JCEU50", "B003A0TFP8", "B000CNF4LK", "B001D27GLK", "B0001IXTIG", "B004VPHPQ2", "B000TZJC1E", "B009GGWWMS", "B0000027YN", "B002HMHRE6", "B00BYR1W2S", "B00786XVOG", "B000F7CMQ8", "B000NVIXGE", "B0001FR0JS", "B0000CFW87", "B000J233SK", "B00004XMTJ", "B000002LRT", "B000002LRR", "B00HWWUQWQ", "0982032056", "B00FWMVVKY", "B00FWMVVI6", "B00DJYJWTO", "B00D3UOE7O", "B00FK3WC2Q"], "bought_together": ["B00HGGUS4O", "B00HF95OMI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00HF95OMI", "B00HGGUS4O", "B0007GAEGC", "B002UZXJA6"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 127517}, "categories": [["CDs & Vinyl", "World Music"], ["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 20.0, "brand": "EMD", "asin": "B000LC4CVA", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510v2C7IB0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Celtic Woman: A New Journey - Live At Slane Castle"}
