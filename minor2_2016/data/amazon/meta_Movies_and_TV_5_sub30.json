{"description": "Nothing dates a movie quite as much as a roller-skating blonde in white shorts and a tube top.Midnight Madnessopens with exactly that and quickly follows with a scene in which a student counselor reassures a romantically nervous freshman with the line, \"Flynch, you could be a real Burt Reynolds, I know you could.\" Ah, nostalgia. Made on the cusp of the '80s, afterAnimal Housebut beforePorky's, Disney's college comedy gained a considerable following, thanks to countless screenings on HBO during the Reagan administration. Like all the best cult movies, it's awful, but compelling nonetheless. This is a film in which all the nerds look alike, the jocks have names such as Armpit, and you get to see fat twins shake their abundant disco booties. The plot revolves around an all-night scavenger hunt, with five teams of competing students racing around Los Angeles solving clues and getting into all sorts of amusing scrapes, including a visit to the Pabst brewery that will have you humming ancient advertising songs for days. David Naughton, who went on to star inAn American Werewolf in London, is our hero, but the real fun comes from Stephen Furst as the mean and chubby rich kid and the legendary &uuml;ber-nerd Eddie Deezen as Wesley.  Michael J. Fox makes his film debut as Naughton's troubled but feisty kid brother, and the eagle-eyed viewer may even spot Paul Reubens in a tiny role. Being a Disney film that was released beforePorky'smade shower scenes an integral part of campus comedies, this is a curiously innocent movie--just watch how long it takes the teams to decipher the clue, \"Look between the two giant melons.\" Nevertheless,Midnight Madnessis 112 minutes of undemanding, cheesy fun for anyone who remembers the last days of disco. It makesAnimal Houselook like Chekhov, but watch it with a group of friends, and perhaps a little Pabst Blue Ribbon, and you'll have a hoot.--Simon Leake", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 412416}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.22, "brand": "", "asin": "0764005553", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51TNSHP1F5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Midnight Madness [VHS]"}

{"description": "You know that old dramatic principle of suspension of disbelief? You'll have to rely on it for this box-office smash, but you won't be disappointed. Harrison Ford plays a U.S. president who single-handedly employs his rigid antiterrorism policy when a band of Russian thugs hatch a mid-flight takeover of Air Force One. Gary Oldman, who chews the scenery as the lead terrorist, will shoot a hostage at the slightest provocation. Glenn Close plays the sternly pragmatic vice president who negotiates with Oldman from her Washington seat of power. If you can believe that the aircraft's pressurized cabin can sustain hundreds of rounds of machine-gun fire, you'll buy anything in this entertaining potboiler, especially thanks to Ford's stalwart heroics and some nifty special effects. Director Wolfgang Petersen (Das Boot) keeps the action moving so fast you won't be sweating the details.

{"description": "If anyone ever doubts whether Nicole Kidman is a good actress, they should immediately be required to watch this outrageously wicked comedy from 1995, for which Kidman deservedly won a Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Leading Role. While director Gus Van Sant handles the fact-based satire with razor-sharp precision, Kidman delivers a deliciously devious performance as Suzanne Stone, a small-town New Hampshire housewife who fancies herself the next Barbara Walters, Jane Pauley, Diane Sawyer, and Maria Shriver all rolled up into one meticulously coiffed package. So determined is she to have a successful career on TV that she'll stop at nothing--even the calculated murder of her husband (Matt Dillon)--to get the attention she feels entitled to. To carry out her scheme she recruits some unwitting local teenagers including one boy (Joaquin Phoenix, matching Kidman's excellence) whose infatuation with Suzanne leads to sexual escapades and predictably troublesome consequences. It's a satirical comedy in Van Sant's capable hands, but it's so close to tabloid reality that the film never seems implausible--which only gives it a funnier, more blood-chilling quality of humor. Featuring Illeanna Douglas, George Segal, andSeinfeldalumnus Wayne Knight in memorable supporting roles, this is one of the best comedies of the '90s--especially if you prefer comedies with a decidedly darker edge.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305161933", "B004AE3QYE", "B004P7CMUU", "B006YTGLE0", "B000067J3P", "B00005JNQA", "B0007P0X9G", "B0002DB52M", "B009R8Q8Y8", "6305594333", "B000NO1XG8", "B00006L91I", "B00004Y87P", "B0013D8LKO", "B00AEFYUQQ", "B0001GF2D8", "B004SUDQ0O", "B0002W4UDE", "B009B1EPQ4", "B001RJ1Y62", "B00005QJJB", "B000068QPV", "B00AEFXX9Q", "0767821009", "6305308837", "B0043X1FNQ", "B000HC2LHG", "B00441GYZ6", "B00005JMIJ", "B000E5N684", "B006YTGL3G", "B0001EFUFK", "B00827OWO8", "B0011NVC8Y", "0767812158", "B00HQLZC18", "0792845811", "B00005JKJA", "B00AEFYD2M", "B00AEFY8MM", "B0000542CB", "B00011CZRE", "B00007AJFB", "B0045HCIYA", "B00AEBB8ZG", "B000H5TH1Q", "B005DR64OQ", "B00BSN0VZW", "B004SIP92O", "B004SIP86Q", "B0021L9M2I", "B004SUDQC2", "B000HT38EO", "B00GNZM0D6", "B004SIP6QI", "6305213305", "0780627776", "B00008L3UE", "B00JVQ7QTM", "B0007R4SX6", "B00GUO2SKA", "B00AEBB9LO", "B000BOH904", "B00006472O", "B00AEBB8SS", "B00AEFXBPM", "B00E1HIWXU", "B004O26LAI", "B003AWRM9M", "B008220DGE", "B00003CWN3", "0767815718", "0784011710", "B000U1ZV76", "B000PAAJZ6", "6305428107", "B00005JLHW", "B00JJ3EHCG", "B003LR5BD0", "B00H9HZITU", "6305161895", "B000ASDFGI", "B00H83EUQW", "B0003JANWS", "B004ALIG4W", "B0010KP360", "B0050UEVNM", "B00096S49Y", "B000N3SU92", "B00007AJF8", "B00AEFXESQ", "B000068V9U", "B00AEBBA2W", "B003EYVXTG", "B004SUDQ22", "6304696515", "B00J0IN6Z4", "B00G7QPXUI", "B000JBXXYK", "B0072BNJZ8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["6305594333", "B004AE3QYE", "B006YTGLE0", "B00AEBB8P6"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 126577}, "asin": "076781777X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51CH7THFMDL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "To Die For"}
{"description": "This feature version of Rod Serling's memorable teleplay, theatrically released in 1962, was previously produced in 1956 for  live television. The grim tale stars Anthony Quinn as a brain-damaged fighter suffering from too many years in the ring yet pushed into another and yet another punishing round by his corrupt manager (Jackie Gleason). Yearning for a life of his own, Quinn's burned-out hitter falls for a shy social worker (Julie Harris), while Gleason's small-timer tries fending off the pressures of truly bad guys who want the money he owes them. Directed by Ralph Nelson (who also made the TV version), thisRequiemopens up into a powerful piece of social realism with the undercurrent of a cautionary fable. The characters are almost archetypal, the story never stops moving, the acting is superb (Mickey Rooney is very good as Quinn's reluctant trainer), and the ending is nightmarishly apt.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B002VRNJ08", "B001E1HCQY", "B000005YSI"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 292233}, "asin": "0767807693", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/512XSXYK8DL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Requiem for a Heavyweight [VHS]"}

{"description": "Jackie Chan finally conquered America withRumble in the Bronx. If the mildly contorted English dialogue sounds peculiarly foreign and disembodied (most of it is dubbed), and the mountains of Vancouver, BC don't convincingly double for the skyline of New York City, well, peculiarities like these actually contribute something to the movie's ingenuous charm. With his disarming smile and feline physicality, the compact Chan radiates star quality. But there's more to him than charisma: at his best, the actor combines the relentlessly escalating, hyperkinetic action set-pieces for which Hong Kong is famous; the rigorous martial arts training of his idol, Bruce Lee; and the grace and daring that distinguish Buster Keaton's physical comedy. Chan also shares some of Keaton's cinematic integrity, which dictated that you shouldn't cheat the audience by faking stunts, on the set or in the editing room. Like Keaton, Chan does his own stunts, and you can see that it really is him jumping off a bridge onto a speeding boat, or clinging to the dangling ladder of a helicopter as the hostile pilot tries to shake him loose by smashing him into the sides of skyscrapers. Not that it matters, really, but the plot ofRumble in the Bronxhas something to do with Chan helping the woman who has taken over his uncle's neighborhood market when she is harassed by local hoodlums. What really matters is Chan, and he's in fine form.Rumble in the Bronxdoesn't rank with his best work, but it's a swell introduction to a unique star. And those stunt outtakes over the end credits are as delightfully spellbinding as ever. &quot;See?&quot; Chan seems to say every time he breaks a rib or twists an ankle (which happens often). &quot;I'm doing this all for you.&quot;--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000I2KOB0", "0767819640", "B004U7MR1O", "0780622677", "B00005YUNV", "B006LOC01G", "B004SUDQAY", "B000006A17", "B00AWHDEIQ", "0767851161", "B00005JL8Z", "078062260X", "B000EWBKIK", "B004SIP8TS", "B00H4KQMX8", "B000HC2M3Y", "B000Y11BC6", "B0000SX9N2", "B000UXOM88", "B00HVFA37C", "B001BEK8HO", "B004TP55XY", "B0051SFTGQ", "B000UNYK3U", "B004SUDQ7W", "B002NPY7EA", "B00D9EJG5E", "B000VUDSH6", "B0002S64TQ", "B002ZG99M2", "B000BVM1QO", "B00BNADY8Q", "B004SNJ08S", "B004SUDQCC", "B004SUDQ4K", "B004TJWDNA", "B004SUDPZU", "B004GJYRKA", "B000Q7ZKWK", "B005CFBZFW", "B00AWHDFIA", "B004SUDPWS", "B00008IHUC", "B008WAM2BU", "B000KX0IMW", "B004U7MR0K", "B004H83IOQ", "B00008WJE4", "B000OT6V64", "B00003CXJ1", "B005M2AKIS", "B00003CY5Y", "B000K2UW06", "B00003CY5A", "B0009VBTQY", "B00006RCOC", "B000WGYMTC", "B002GSXKO2", "B000LC4Z7Q", "B00005JLRQ", "B003EVAG4C", "B005ZMBEXU", "B001L2ZSJO", "B00C7E3E96", "B0016MJ6JC", "B00C7E3EBE", "B004SIP88Y", "B0045HCJGC", "B000GFLKDU", "0783226985", "B00016MSV2", "B000A2IPQY", "B0001NBMOY", "B003INBNXO", "B00376AVIK", "B0080QOL0Q", "0783228465", "B0000640VF", "B000N4SHNK", "B005FQ1OOK", "B005K8RJNS", "B00005OOQ1", "B0015RCUR8", "B002XTXGA2", "B004I1AGTC", "B00005N89J", "B005ZMBEXA", "B005KK2FWG", "B004JXCR64", "B000VSDN2I", "B00008EY6M", "B001BEK8GA", "B0036BDQLA", "B008NP4ZUU", "B009Z4AAK2", "B009INAEI8", "B001L67A4G", "B002TVQ4CG", "B000X1Z0CO", "B000I0RNWU"], "bought_together": ["0767819640", "B000I2KOB0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004U7MR1O", "B000I2KOB0", "B001BEK8HO", "B00388PK88"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 20307}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.81, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "0780619331", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51PZZ0A9TCL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Rumble in the Bronx"}

{"description": "Even if the notorious 1970s porn-filmmaking milieu doesn't exactly turn you on, don't let it turn you off to this movie's extraordinary virtues, either.Boogie Nightsis one of the key movies of the 1990s, and among the most ambitious and exuberantly alive American movies in years. It's also the breakthrough for an amazing new director, whose dazzling kaleidoscopic style here recalls the Robert Altman ofNashvilleand the Martin Scorsese ofGoodFellas. Although loosely based on the sleazy life and times of real-life porn legend John Holmes, at heart it's a classic Hollywood rise-and-fall fable: a naive, good-looking young busboy is discovered in a San Fernando Valley disco by a famous motion picture producer, becomes a hotshot movie star, lives the high life, and then loses everything when he gets too big for his britches, succumbs to insobriety, and is left behind by new times and new technology. Of course, it ain't exactlyA Star Is BornorSingin' in the Rain.  Writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson (in only his second feature!) puts his own affectionately sardonic twist on the old showbiz biopic formula: the ambitious upstart changes his name and achieves stardom in porno films as &quot;Dirk Diggler.&quot; Instead of drinking to excess, he snorts cocaine (the classic drug of '70s hedonism); and it's the coming of home video (rather than talkies) that helps to dash his big-screen dreams. As for the britches ... well, the controversial &quot;money shot&quot; explains everything.

{"description": "The dominant themes of director Sidney Lumet's distinguished career are in full force in this moral melodrama involving a young district attorney (Andy Garcia) who takes on a career-making case only to uncover his father's possible involvement in pervasive police corruption. Balancing personal ethics and political compromise in a high-wire act of power and its abuse, Lumet relies on dialogue and superb performances (including those by Ron Leibman, Richard Dreyfuss, and Lena Olin) to achieve a devastating impact. The script (based on the novelTainted Evidenceby Robert Daley) is too smart and Lumet's direction too sure-footed to fall back on the black-and-white exploits of conventional criminals and their crimes. The movie's moral framework (like that of Lumet's earlier filmQ&A;) is more realistic, dealing in the gray areas between right and wrong where misdeeds can arise from the best intentions. At the center of Garcia's dilemma is his father, a seasoned New York cop played so convincingly by Ian Holm that you'd never guess the actor was British. Although it received mixed reviews when released in 1997,Night Falls on Manhattanranks among Lumet's finest films.--Jeff Shannon", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 228780}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.0, "brand": "", "asin": "0782007058", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51MBY8BXTBL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Night Falls on Manhattan [VHS]"}
{"description": "In the vastly overrated 1998 bookEasy Riders, Raging Bulls, author Peter Biskind puts the blame for Hollywood's blockbuster mentality at least partially on Steven Spielberg's box-office success with this adaptation of Peter Benchley's bestselling novel. But you can't blame Spielberg for making a terrific movie, whichJawsdefinitely is. The story of a Long Island town whose summer tourist business is suddenly threatened by great-white-shark attacks on humans bypasses the potboiler trappings of Benchley's book and goes straight for the jugular with beautifully crafted, crowd-pleasing sequences of action and suspense supported by a trio of terrific performances by Roy Scheider (as the local sheriff), Richard Dreyfuss (as a shark specialist), and particularly Robert Shaw (as the old fisherman who offers to hunt the shark down). The sequences on Shaw's boat--as the three of them realize that in fact the shark is huntingthem--are what entertaining moviemaking is all about.--Marshall Fine", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005B6ND", "6300183181", "0784011923", "0767825411", "6305814694", "B00000JGEI", "6303148352", "6303506291", "630018403X", "B00000490M", "6300214753", "6304932553", "630442972X", "6300269639", "B0000048S1", "B000005PFL", "6302765536", "6302091632", "6302824729", "6303344224", "6301570723", "6300247171", "B00008WFU5", "6305576173", "6300183467", "0790743213", "6304143184", "6303402348", "1558808221", "6303020089", "B000063UUL", "B00005B238", "6303212379", "B00005A8XX", "0790731436", "0783226152", "0790705141", "6300267881", "B00008WFU4", "6300181340", "630157401X", "6302921058", "6300214060", "6302968143", "1558802258", "0792102320", "6300214087", "6300268993", "B0000BWVBD", "B002GHHHL0", "6301888901", "B00005JKDQ", "6303122647", "6302800420", "6303610811", "6301827732", "6303540082", "6302374189", "0800198395", "6300214435", "6304071876", "6301208773", "B00000IO4G", "B00006G8LB", "B0087ZG7HK", "B00008DZ83", "6300214710", "6300215814", "630220366X", "6304457324", "0800116917", "B000059XY5", "6303212263", "6300216500", "6303236863", "630533577X", "6300213986", "6302415853", "6304935811", "6302820448", "B00004U8P4", "6300214311", "6301798503", "0793927501", "6300214370", "6302787564", "6304288433", "6300182878", "B000003KHS", "6301971809", "B000007OY0", "0790734079", "630336568X", "0790733927", "0790742322", "6301966988", "0764006770", "B000059XVO", "B00023BLXA"], "also_viewed": ["B00008WFU5", "6301792734", "6305814694", "B00005B6ND", "0784011923", "0767825411", "6300214060", "6300183181", "6300247171", "B00005A8XX", "6303506291", "B00006AL1C", "0792151712", "6304539258", "630018403X", "6305363668", "B00008WFU4", "B00000JGEI", "B00078XGO2", "6304117752", "6301574117", "0800116917", "B000005PPB", "B0056BE0SG", "6302091632", "080010367X", "6304143184", "6300216845", "6304539274", "6303148352", "0792158261", "B00000JS61", "0792839846", "6303212379", "0792837614", "0783222955", "0783221347", "0790700506", "6302921058", "6301797906", "6301976983", "6305123616", "6303402070", "6304429274", "1558807780", "B00005JKDQ", "6300214370", "6302936381", "B00000JGEK", "B0000AQZYM", "B00000JXVM", "B0007KTBIU", "0790734079", "6304039522", "6300214753", "B00005NCCP", "B005FHWWXQ", "B0087F7VSY", "B00KDU8HQQ"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 177995}, "asin": "0783216084", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514JQY1K3TL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Jaws [VHS]"}
{"description": "You might think that this 1997 comedy based on the popular late-'50s TV series would be little more than a pointless clone of its small-screen predecessor, but as a harmless slice of family entertainment it's surprisingly easy to take. Of course nobody could ever hope to match the original Cleaver family for Eisenhower-era charm, but there's cleverness afoot in the notion of presenting the Clinton-era Cleavers with just a hint of dysfunction beneath all that domestic bliss and innocence. While Ward (Christopher McDonald) pushes his son Beaver (Cameron Finley) onto the football team to compensate for the lost glories of his bygone youth, Beaver's grades suffer along with his self-esteem. When a teacher suggests that the Cleavers seek family counseling, June (Janine Turner) has visions of Beaver in the loony bin.  Meanwhile, brother Wally is wracked with guilt over dating his friend Eddie Haskell's object of affection, but eventually these various plot lines (borrowed from the TV show) converge for the requisite happy ending.

{"description": "Steven Spielberg's 1993 mega-hit rivalsJawsas the most intense and frightening film he'd ever made prior toSchindler's List, but it was also among his weakest stories. Based on Michael Crichton's novel about an island amusement park populated by cloned dinosaurs, the film works best as a thrill ride with none of the interesting human dynamics of Spielberg'sJaws. That lapse proves unfortunate, but there's no shortage of raw terror as a rampaging T-rex and nasty raptors try to make fast food out of the cast. The effects are still astonishing (despite the fact that the computer-generated technology has since been improved upon) and at times primeval, such as the sight of a herd of whatever-they-are scampering through a valley.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00004U8P4", "B00003CXXR", "6303314015", "6301792734", "6304143184", "0783216084", "0767825411", "6304089767", "6303506291", "B00005JKDQ", "6300214060", "6301208773", "6301888901", "6302091632", "6304233639", "6302054982", "0788805533", "B00000JGEI", "6301666569", "6302453356", "6305319138", "B0000AQZYM", "6302787068", "6301744136", "B000059XXZ", "B000059XY5", "B000005QWI", "0784011923", "6304500831", "6303020089", "B000003KSM", "6302968143", "6302415853", "6300214435", "B00000490M", "6301744160", "630157401X", "6302877881", "6304007523", "6300181987", "6301661729", "6304030959", "0800198395", "0783226152", "B000062XM6", "B00005B238", "6303212263", "630596260X", "B000005PPB", "B0000048S1", "6303824382", "B000007OY0", "B000005PFL", "6300248089", "B00004RFFA", "6300213005", "6305045976", "080010367X", "6304022166", "B00006G8LB", "0790700506", "0790719029", "B00005B6ND", "0790742322", "6304196954"], "bought_together": ["B00004U8P4", "B00003CXXR"], "also_viewed": ["B00004U8P4", "B00003CXXR", "6304143184", "6301792734", "6305750750", "6304089767", "6303506291", "B0087ZG7NO", "B00005LL26", "6300214753", "6304539258", "0788806270", "0784011923", "B00005JLGL", "B0057R5XRG", "B000065U6Q", "6304400551", "0767825411", "0788805533", "6304500831", "B0002XNSYA", "6302787068", "B00000K2SC", "0780607287", "155890641X", "6304539274", "6302091632", "B00000JS61", "B0000AQZYM", "0792839129", "B00004U8KV", "B00005JKDQ", "6303313345", "0788812807", "6302526574", "6300213803", "630018403X", "6302426200", "B00005MP5C", "B000035Z2S", "080010367X", "B00023NRSM", "6301543408", "0790705141", "6304015127", "B00004R99N", "6303212379", "0783216084", "6302320402", "6304718551", "B0087ZG7J8", "B00000JGEI", "6303953425", "B005N64U52", "6303929567", "6303314015", "6302453356"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 481629}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.68, "brand": "", "asin": "0783222734", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51MNFQR1V1L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]"}
{"description": "After the global phenomenon that wasJurassic Park, it was a given that novelist Michael Crichton would conjure up a sequel and that Steven Spielberg would then commit it to film. Considering the potential profit involved, it was practically a commercial mandate. Perhaps it was inevitable that both efforts were contrived, and well below the talents of Crichton (well, maybe) and certainly Spielberg, who just didn't have the heart for this recycling after the artistic triumph ofSchindler's List. What we're left with, for better and worse, is a redundant blockbuster that still benefits from Spielberg's mastery of high-intensity action sequences and the further development of amazing computer-generated special effects. What's missing is the awe and wonder that madeJurassic Parka technical marvel and a dazzling product of scientific imagination. The story's a no-brainer: after the deadly fiasco of the original dinosaur theme park, we're taken (along with returning star Jeff Goldblum) to a second island where genetically engineered dinosaurs still thrive under the watchful eye of Goldblum's biologist girlfriend (Julianne Moore). But a devious capitalist (Arliss Howard) is determined to export dinosaurs to a new park in San Diego, financing a hunt-and-capture expedition that results in another series of fatal disasters. In Spielberg's hands this movie's more exciting than it has a right to be, given the creative paucity of Crichton's novel and David Koepp's adapted screenplay. The special effects are state-of-the-art, and the T-Rex's rampage through the streets of San Diego is nothing short of spectacular; but apparently an improvement upon the shortcomings ofJurassic Parkwas too much to hope for.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00003CXXR", "6303148352", "0788805533", "6301666569", "6304290888", "6303506291", "0783216084", "6304169558", "6303212379", "B0000524CZ", "B0000048S1", "B00006FDFG", "6304155972", "0788811002"], "bought_together": ["B00003CXXR", "6303148352"], "also_viewed": ["B00B4804KS", "B0087ZG7J8", "6303148352", "B0057R5XRG", "B00003CXXR", "0788812408", "078881172X", "080010367X", "6304015127", "630157401X", "6303486894", "B00000JGEI", "630021463X", "6303215734", "6300215830", "6302320402", "6304089767", "6305750750", "B00005JM5E", "6303314015", "6302642248", "B000LPS4BG", "079213690X", "B008M4MB8K", "B007LNBS2I", "B00HWWUQWQ"]}, "price": 25.93, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 670881}, "asin": "0783223358", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51FZH56FA4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Lost World: Jurassic Park [VHS]"}

{"description": "Yet another potent (although critically underrated) drama from Jim Sheridan and Daniel Day-Lewis, the Irish director and British star (respectively) ofMy Left FootandIn the Name of the Father. The story focuses on Danny Flynn (Day-Lewis), a promising boxer who had been imprisoned at age 18 for associating with IRA terrorists. After serving a 14-year sentence, he returns to his Belfast neighborhood at a time when local IRA leader Joe Hamill (Brian Cox) is attempting to negotiate a peace treaty with the British. Despite having no further interest in IRA rivalries, Danny finds himself at the center of political and emotional turmoil when he is reunited with his former girlfriend Maggie (Emily Watson, ofBreaking the Waves) who, in Danny's absence, married another IRA man who is now in prison. A strict, unwritten law forbids relationships with the wives of IRA prisoners, but as the former boxer channels his energy into reviving a neighborhood boxing gym, the attraction between Danny and Maggie proves irresistible. This gives a strategic advantage to a militant IRA rival who opposes the peace treaty, drawing Danny back into the bitter and potentially deadly struggle between warring IRA factions. Emphasizing the emotional complexities that arise between Danny and Maggie, this powerful, superbly acted drama demonstrates a sharp understanding of the deep-rooted fears and loyalties that fuel the &quot;troubles&quot; in Ireland, where peace seemed to finally (if tentatively) be achieved in the summer of 1998.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["630310360X"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 468133}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.49, "brand": "", "asin": "0783227280", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51WD28B954L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Boxer [VHS]"}

{"description": "The original cowriter and director ofFear and Loathing in Las Vegaswas Alex Cox, whose earlier filmSid and Nancysuggests that Cox could have been a perfect match in filming  Hunter&nbsp;S. Thompson's psychotropic masterpiece of \"gonzo\" journalism. Unfortunately Cox departed due to the usual \"creative differences,\" and this ill-fated adaptation was thrust upon Terry Gilliam, whose formidable gifts as a visionary filmmaker were squandered on the seemingly unfilmable elements of Thompson's ether-fogged narrative. The result is a one-joke movie without the joke--an endless series of repetitive scenes involving rampant substance abuse and the hallucinogenic fallout of a road trip that's run crazily out of control. Johnny Depp plays Thompson's alter ego, \"gonzo\" journalist Raoul Duke, and Benicio Del Toro is his sidekick and so-called lawyer Dr. Gonzo. During the course of a trip to Las Vegas to cover a motorcycle race, they ingest a veritable chemistry set of drugs, and Gilliam does his best to show us the hallucinatory state of their zonked-out minds. This allows for some dazzling imagery and the rampant humor of stumbling buffoons, and the mumbling performances of Depp and Del Toro wholeheartedly embrace the tripped-out, paranoid lunacy of Thompson's celebrated book. But over two hours of this insanity tends to grate on the nerves--like being the only sober guest at a party full of drunken idiots. So while Gilliam's film may achieve some modest cult status over the years, it's only becauseFear and Loathingis best enjoyed by those who are just as stoned as the characters in the movie.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0006H32EI", "B006ISJQ1W", "B00003CXWV", "0767837398", "B002AF4Y9G", "B000A7DVR2", "B001EDFSIQ", "0679785892", "B0057ZAA6W", "6305313687", "B00029RTAI", "B0007DFJ0G", "B002QEHPQU", "B00008975Z", "B001HN69AY", "B004SIP9Z6", "B00005JM23", "B000F7CECK", "B000JMK6LW", "B000093FLA", "B000P0J09M", "B003HKN52U", "0783225903", "B00005R87R", "B004SIP95G", "B00000IRE6", "B000031EFY", "B00005ATQB", "B005Y4I6VW", "B0006HBZE2", "B00005Q4CS", "B004FQX5B6", "B009NNXQJW", "B0000VD04M", "B00006JDU8", "B00005V9HH", "B00011CZRE", "B002T9H2LA", "B000C20VPA", "B002CPMB9O", "B000AXWHSA", "B000ASDFI6", "B000P0J0D8", "0792838068", "B003W88QVC", "B00029RTCG", "B0011E5M66", "B0007PALZ2", "B00005JMJG", "B007D0FVRM", "B001J9KJ4I", "B006ISJQBM", "B000EMGJAO", "B0000CDUT5", "B000KB4898", "B0000AC8LR", "B004P7CNC2", "B004SIP7TE", "B00AEFXE9U", "B004SIP8ES", "B00AEFYS2M", "B000C20VRS", "B0000AC8LI", "B00ALU48M0", "B0009A40ES", "B000LP6KNU", "B00H9KKGTO", "B00AEBB8NI", "B0000640VJ", "B004SIP6LS", "B000286RP2", "B000GGSMC6", "0780621611", "B001HN694K", "B00009W5CA", "B004XVMCH6", "B001GCUO0W", "B000GBEWGQ", "B0006GAOJA", "B008R65XYC", "B000IY04Q8", "B000006NN1", "B000S6M1Y4", "B0012E2GFK", "B0007UC8Y4", "B0043X1FM2", "B0001CNRRU", "B00ALU46VI", "0767835093", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00005NTOH", "B000MMMT9G", "B005LAIIJY", "B00AG4714S", "B00000K3TS", "B000053VAZ", "B00009MGEM", "B001M4YZ90", "B002ZG980U", "1451659717"], "bought_together": ["B00003CXWV"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0679785892", "B00029RTAI", "0783225903", "B000A7DVR2"]}, "price": 5.0, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 3274}, "asin": "0783229526", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51LL2U2I2AL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"}
{"description": "Clint Eastwood held the dual role of director and star of this 1975 spy thriller, which makes up for sluggish  pacing with a breathtaking climax on a treacherous peak in the Swiss Alps. The plot kicks into gear when Eastwood,  playing a retired assassin, is recruited back into a secret organization to avenge the murder of an old friend. He's then  blackmailed into making a second \"hit\"; this time his target is one of three men who will be attempting to conquer the  Eiger, a dangerous peak in Switzerland. Himself an accomplished climber, Eastwood's character joins the expedition  with George Kennedy as leader of the ground crew. Shifting loyalties, apparent betrayals, and paranoid suspicion factor  into the suspenseful climax on the sheer face of the mountain. This memorable sequence--for which Eastwood  performed his own mountain-climbing stunts--is effectively intense, built on a standard plot of double-cross and  intrigue that was intended to combine Eastwood's screen persona with the global adventure of the James Bond films.  For the most part it works--it's not one of Eastwood's better films, but it's got some first-class thrills (and a sly  performance by Jack Cassidy) to grab and hold your interest.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0001FVDJQ", "B0037A4ILC", "B003AWRMCO", "B003AWRMBU", "B00005LC4R", "B007AFBYYY", "B003ASLJNQ", "0783227930", "B003ASLJMW", "B003AWRMCY", "B00AEFXVOI", "B000055Y0Y", "B003AWRMC4", "0783228007", "B003AWRM9W", "0792845838", "B003ASLJIQ", "B003AWRMA6", "B003ASLJKE", "B003ASLJJU", "B00008CMT4", "B00009N83V", "B003ASLJS6", "B003ASLJPE", "B0015XHQUI", "B001R10BN2", "B000A2WJBQ", "B000X73NAE", "B003ASLJMM", "B00AEBB9EG", "6304698801", "B0015XHQU8", "B004G9UXFI", "B00AEFYTEY", "B000MGTQ7U", "B0015XHQT4", "B0015XHQTY", "B003AWRM9M", "B003AWRMBA", "0792839056", "B003ASLJRC", "B00020X94W", "0783225725", "B001CT876W", "B003ASLJOU", "B00007GZRI", "0792844017", "B0006B2A42", "B001XURJCS", "B00004STDN", "B001T21R50", "B002Z7FWBI", "B00006FDAP", "B00004XPPC", "B000N3SSBW", "B00IL6LJ2S", "B00008MTYA", "B00004ZBVI", "B00186DV1U", "B0019BI1DM", "B0007TKNM4", "B00388PK7O", "B004J2FJC4", "B0001FVDK0", "B00008OE4W", "B00003CXQG", "B001FZQOW2", "B00000K0DM", "B00AEFY9YY", "B003AWRMCE", "B00018D404", "0792843576", "B000LPRHLO", "B00005YUNO", "B00066FBQG", "B00DZFKNFO", "B00008K76U", "B00E3QJ7ZG", "B00005JP3T", "B00007ELD2", "B0000AUHPB", "B000E5N6KW", "B0076YFJ8Q", "B001M9ELQ2", "B004IFYMXE", "B004I1K05W", "B000O78L0U", "B001PYD0PC", "B00CMYRTCO", "1400098025", "0783229372", "6305245487", "B00IARA8KM", "B00096S4B2", "B007N31YH0", "B0013LL2Z2", "B004TJ1GYW", "B0029F21AQ", "B00005JLV5", "B00AEFYPHA"], "bought_together": ["B003AWRMCO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001M9ELQ2", "B003ASLJRC", "B00AEFXVOI", "B003ASLJS6"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 38607}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.9, "brand": "EASTWOOD,CLINT", "asin": "0783230346", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51X2TJ9A0FL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Eiger Sanction"}
{"description": "Derivative fluff from 1987, made tolerable by its bawdy exuberance and an appealing performance by Michael J. Fox, who was still enjoying TV stardom and the career momentum he earned by travelingBack to the Future. Here he plays a Kansas farm boy who dreams of scoring big in New York City, but reality turns out to be brutal to his ambition. When his uncle (Richard Jordan) gives him a mail-room job in the high-rise headquarters of a major corporation, Fox occupies an empty office and poses as a young executive, winning the attention of a lovely young colleague (Helen Slater) and having an affair with his boss's wife (Margaret Whitton). Sporadically amusing as a yuppie comedy and rather off-putting as a wannabe sex farce, the movie's still recommendable for its lively cast and a breezy style that almost succeeds in updating the conventions of vintage screwball comedy. Whitton is a standout performer here, so you may wonder why her comedic talent has been underrated, apart from a good role in the first twoMajor Leaguemovies. This may be little more than a big-screen sitcom, but it's not without its charms.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305133468", "B00009AOBH", "B0007IO6NM", "0783230354", "B0012RWQJ8", "B00013WWT8", "B000065V3H", "B0000A14TA", "B00AEBB9DW", "6305213283", "B000065U1Q", "B00015YVD6", "6305428050", "B0001IN0S0", "B00005R5G9", "B005QX8UEE", "B002O3Z4YI", "B00D2UMHVK", "6305236569", "B000063UR3", "B0015RRN9S", "B001ECDVK4", "B00441GYQ0", "B00005T7I0", "B000F6ZIIS", "0783230060", "B001AEF6C2", "B000E6ESI0", "B000FO0A9W", "B00AEBB99Q", "0783226896", "B002XUBDRY", "B000FO0AA6", "B001Q8MMD8", "B00009PY3X", "B000068TPB", "6305428395", "B0043X1FLI", "B00AEFYW64", "B00ALTQRRK", "B001ECDVJU", "B00AEBB9E6", "B000035Z5H", "B000068MC0", "0792844866", "0783225504", "B000Y11B7Q", "B00009AOBM", "B00081U7HC", "B0002B15X8", "B0000A98ZO", "B00009AOBK", "B00AEBB8YW", "B00E1HIXFW", "B000F6ZIII", "B000059TGG", "B0000542C9", "B000065V3L", "B0001GOH84", "B0045HCJRG", "B00DJYKD0G", "B002GHHHP6", "B0001EFTSS", "B00AG475K8", "B0000648ZQ", "B00AEFXX9Q", "B00005U5A8", "B00020HB4Q", "B0053TWVR8", "B005FQ2H8W", "B00005V5NS", "B00441GYZG", "B000065V3E", "B000CEV3M8", "B003IQ5YZE", "078322740X", "B0038Z5T4Q", "B000PMFRYC", "B00008G8M4", "B002GHHHNI", "B001LXIDVI", "B0006GANOQ", "B0001GOH7U", "B001Q8MMCE", "B000N60H9U", "B001LXIDW2", "B00AEFXXMI", "B0015NORDW", "B00005N5SB", "B0043X1FOU", "B005OK0YVG", "B0045HCIYU", "6304711891", "B00070FX5U", "B00K31RBYY", "B00803PFXG", "B00AEBB9WI", "B000SFOW8I", "B00AEFXYJA", "B00026ZG10"], "bought_together": ["6305133468"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000N60H9U", "6305133468", "B00319ECII", "6305236569"]}, "price": 6.66, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 11839}, "asin": "0783229364", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515B421EWKL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Secret of My Success"}

{"description": "A glossy romantic comedy,The Best Mancenters on four college friends and the women in their lives, all brought back together for a wedding. Taye Diggs (How Stella Got Her Groove Back) plays the title character, a young writer whose first novel is a barely fictionalized account of his college days, featuring barely fictionalized versions of all his friends. This novel hasn't yet been released, but ambitious TV producer Nia Long (Soul Food) has snagged an advance copy in the hopes of getting an early interview with Diggs. Unfortunately, when this advance copy begins circulating among the college gang, they discover it reveals some secrets that may have a disastrous effect on the wedding.The Best Manfeatures a handsome, charming cast and a propulsive story, but the female characters are poorly developed and the male banter is, to say the least, chauvinistic. This banter is mostly to comic effect, but by the end it still leaves a sour taste that the movie's happy ending doesn't counter. With a particularly strong performance by Terrence Howard as an aimless but relentlessly honest member of the college quartet.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B00GOZ2LPM", "B005LAIH86", "B000XT1P52", "B00BTYPWDQ", "B00005JLON", "B00066FAQW", "B00004Y2R1", "B00005LB86", "B00H47IX5G", "B00066FAC6", "B00066FAVW", "B001132GNY", "B003Y5H58S", "B00000JGHO", "6305505780", "B000YAF4Q6", "B00005RIX5", "B002ZG99RW", "B001K98MGE", "0780627822", "B002CA68NO", "B00F3AC5PA", "B00001X597", "B00BEL4QFO", "B001DJLCQS", "B00ANDDBBY", "B003UEYBPI", "B000BITV9W", "B000BOH8X2", "B001DJLD12", "B0000TWMWK", "B00L4KS0HA", "B000035P5I", "B00003W8NT", "B0041QSZS8", "B003L16FCC", "B000093I8L", "B00008977B", "B002GSXKOM", "B000LW7REE", "B00AZMFJ90", "6305428409", "B000PE0GRI", "B002VKB0LU", "B0018RNF60", "B003B3O5FY", "0767821955", "B003Y5H4ZC", "B00AEFYE08", "B00003CY51", "B0000YEE6M", "B008Y1YJN6", "B005LAIH1S", "0767813901", "B00097DXFS", "B00007ELEO", "B004BZ5AFA", "B000HDZKLO", "B0026JI1R2", "B0000TWMTS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00GOZ2LPM", "B005LAIH86", "B000XT1P52", "B00H47IX5G"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 521261}, "asin": "078323418X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RE5TVXVFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "THE BEST MAN"}

{"description": "Suffering from the extreme bad luck of being released at the same time as the low-budgetThe Blair Witch Project, this adaptation ofThe Haunting of Hill Houseattempts to update Shirley Jackson's psychologically terrifying ghost story to the era of big-budget, computerized special effects. Does it work? Well, let's just say that showing isn't exactly the same as telling. A prime example of bloated studio filmmaking,The Hauntingtelegraphs all its frights so blatantly that it forsakes any of Jackson's subtle horrors for the remedial scares of a clunky carnival ride. The story remains basically the same, with four people called to an old mansion for experiments in the supernatural, but instead of getting inside the heads of its main characters (as the 1963 adaptation by Robert Wise did so well), Jan DeBont's film deserts character development for the huge, glorious set design provided by Eugenio Zanetti (Restoration). Thus, instead of a well-drawn story you get... a well-drawn house, one that four very talented and underutilized actors--Lili Taylor, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Liam Neeson, and Owen Wilson--wander around in endlessly (as Zeta-Jones puts it, the house is \"sort of Charles Foster Kane meets the Munsters\"). Taylor, as the hypersensitive Nell, is the unknowing lynchpin in the battle between good and bad ghosts and gets saddled with most of the expository dialogue of the mansion's gothic backstory. Zeta-Jones (showing some spark) and Neeson (showing none) are sadly reduced to providing reactionary shots of the film's disastrous climax, which mixes hapless new-age affirmations with computer-generated effects of ghosts and exploding windows, walls, doors, etc. For this haunted-house story, take a quick tour of the breathtaking rooms, but definitelydon'tstay the night.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00003CWRF", "B00005UQ9W", "B0045HCJJE", "B000063US5", "B003VA3JUO", "B002AS45VK", "B00AEBBA2W", "B0000C2IQQ", "B00005LIRD", "B002GHHHL0", "B00AEBBA72", "B00K2CHY1Y", "078322799X", "B004SIP92O", "B000V4UFZK", "B00AEFYXQI", "B00BEIYMAG", "B000CCBC9O", "B001BSBBGC", "B00E32PJ02", "B0000AOX0D", "B000UUX2Z0", "B000HC2LFI", "B0021L8UFI", "B00009PY4G", "0767824954", "B0010X73ZG", "B00AEBB91E", "0800177029", "B00AEFYYH6", "B0008191WO", "B00000IQVQ", "B00008LUNW", "B00003CXKM", "6305718954", "B00005JNY3", "B0002DB54A", "B004LWZW24", "B002VWNIDG", "B00DBNLBAQ", "0783116926", "B000GBEWRU", "0783225482", "B00AIBZLVY", "B004AC6PV2", "B0001FR3IQ", "B000GCFO0I", "B000NOIVT0", "B001B1872U", "B004P7CNUY", "B00004BZIY", "B00005JNBN", "B0009X763M", "B000NQRR1Q", "B00006FDCD", "B000AM6OQ2", "B00005O5B5", "0792839684", "B0000694XX", "B00000JQB5", "0780622650", "6305017115", "B003498SCQ", "1573625779", "B001B8XRT6", "B00000IQC4", "B00AEFXPMG", "6305300801", "B00EZ50SGW", "B00006AUIG", "B000TJ6PBK", "B0006SGYL0", "B004SIP9MY", "B001P3SA9Y", "B00023P4TM", "6305090564", "B000AM4P9K", "B00JPS7HOA", "B00B96TGQS", "B003UGLCIA", "B005LAIGOQ", "B004SIP9O2", "B00DZP1C9K", "B000ARXF96", "B004LWZW2O", "6305767866", "B002945DUW", "B000RIWAVW", "B000FFJYBG", "B00005JOWW", "B005TK23PQ", "B004XVMCN0", "B009XTF8KQ", "B001CFEC2Y", "B00006IUFV", "B00317LM8S", "B0021L8UPS", "B008874968", "6305428042", "B008JFUS0U"], "bought_together": ["B000063US5"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00BTYXNRI", "B0045HCJJE", "B000ASATYO", "0783116926"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 18281}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.84, "brand": "Dreamworks Skg", "asin": "0783237413", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51aYQx70GGL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Haunting"}

{"description": "This is the film that cemented Schwarzenegger's spot in the action-brawn firmament, and it was well deserved. He's chilling as the futuristic cyborg who kills without fear, without love, without mercy. James Cameron's story and direction are pared to the bone and all the more creepy. But don't overlook the contributions of Linda Hamilton, who more than holds her own as the Terminator's would-be victim, Sarah Connor--thus creating, along with Sigourney Weaver inAlien, a new generation of rugged, clear-thinking female action stars. It's surprising how well this film holds up, and how its minimalist, malevolent violence is actually way scarier than that of its far more expensive, more effects-laden sequel.--Anne Hurley", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00000JGEI", "0767825411", "0783216084", "630442972X", "B00000490M", "B00005B238", "6300269639", "6303506291", "B0000048S1", "6301570723", "6300214753", "6300183181", "6303344224", "6302824729", "6305814694", "630018403X", "6302765536", "6302091632", "6304932553", "0790731436", "1558802258", "B00005B6ND", "6300248089", "6300213005", "6300189015", "6300213668", "1558808221", "6302822688", "0792845684", "B00000K2SC", "6303446590", "6303020089", "6300214826", "6300989003", "B000059XY5", "6300271331", "B000067CZY", "6303148352", "B001VLBDD0", "B00000ILE6", "B00005JA8B", "B00000JGEK", "6300214087", "6303212263", "6300183211", "B0000BWVBD", "6303540082", "6301827732", "6302374189", "0790731975", "B000059XXZ", "B0000CDL3W", "0790705141", "B00006AL1C", "6305363668", "6300214710", "0792844890", "6300263673", "B00005JLTM", "6301666569", "B00006G8LB", "630196666X", "6303347657", "6304214502", "0790701251", "6304509154", "6300214060", "6300215814", "0783226152", "B0001DI5W6", "B00008DZ83", "6301977815", "6304508611", "6300183467", "6304765789", "B00003CXE6", "6302814782", "6301977742", "B00000J2KZ", "6300182878", "6302415853", "0792835077", "0792836634", "6301976622", "0790742322", "6305576173", "0790733897", "B00023NRSM", "6301574117", "6303236863", "6300214370", "B00001ZWTS", "6301208773", "B00000JGEN", "0792158261", "6300987744", "6302032377", "0780622545", "630196733X"], "bought_together": ["B00000JGEI"], "also_viewed": ["B001RIY4WE", "B00005B238", "B00000JGEI", "6303506291", "0783216084", "0767825411", "6300214060", "6301792734", "6303148352", "6300214540", "080010367X", "B00000490M", "0792158261", "6305363668", "B00000JS61", "6301208773", "6305123616", "6305750750", "6304539258", "6303212263", "6305095566", "6302091632", "6303313345", "0790734079", "6300213005", "0790700506", "B0008JIJ2E", "B00004R99N", "6302824729", "6301792769", "080013558X", "0790705141", "6300248089", "630336568X", "B00G0OHMUG", "6304007523", "B00003CXC5", "6303566634", "B000Q66J1M", "B00GST8UB8", "B001DZFYPW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 310948}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.5, "brand": "", "asin": "0784011923", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510R8ADFV0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Terminator [VHS]"}

{"description": "Writer Ernest Thompson, who came up with the original stage play ofOn Golden Pondand adapted it for film, is lucky to have two giants of the screen give dignity and breadth to his sometimes trite dialogue. Henry Fonda, in his last role, plays a prickly English professor at the disagreeable age of 80. Visiting his summer house by a Maine lake with his wife (Katharine Hepburn), the old man forges an unlikely bond with a lonely boy, comes to terms with his daughter (Jane Fonda), and suffers disorienting effects of mild dementia. Even playing a tired old man, Fonda is an absolute lion of a movie star, and Hepburn brings her special spirit to the part of his worried bride. The onscreen relationship between Henry and Jane Fonda naturally makes one think about their much-discussed difficulties offscreen, but that's a side benefit in a movie that is really just a celebration of simple human decency. Directed by Mark Rydell (Harry and Walter Go to New York).--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002VWNIBI", "6305212112", "B00001W9G0", "B003ASLJK4", "B00DDT0JB0", "B00AEFYK5M", "B0001CNRBG", "B00005NRN8", "B00004TJKK", "B00AEBB9FA", "0767836359", "0783240171", "B0045HCJ76", "B00AEFY4CG", "B0007QJ1XE", "B000765IJK", "B00AEFY0F2", "076780676X", "B000ZM1MG4", "6305128952", "B006FE83UE", "B002GHHHGU", "B001ECDVK4", "0822208482", "B004SIP6C2", "B00AEFXD1O", "B00AEFXYOA", "B002VWNIAY", "B000TXP56C", "B003LMPKSQ", "B000YAF4MA", "B00AEFY8ZE", "B0000DIXDR", "6305236569", "B00AKGG5WG", "B002NZK5RS", "B00005MEOU", "B0000AOV4I", "B004AOECXI", "B00008CMSX", "B000JYW5B4", "B000QQLVPQ", "B00AEFYRJQ", "B00CPTUOI2", "6304698607", "B0000542C9", "0783225733", "B003BV8ICC", "B00079Z9VO", "B000FOPPC4", "B00AEFYXJ0", "B0000648ZR", "B00AEBB97S", "B004SEUJOQ", "B00004W46I", "B000YDBPAM", "B00066FAOE", "B007STBUHI", "B0007ZEOPK", "B007N31YH0", "B000BITVAG", "B00AEBBA0E", "B002M2Z3BA", "0790731886", "B00004RG62", "B0009R1TJ0", "B00070HK24", "B00009AVA5", "B009ERK1ZO", "B00004XPPC", "B00FEDP5XK", "B000Y11BBW", "B00AATV046", "B0000YTP02", "B001JNNDLU", "B0028ZDJN0", "B0013D8LH2", "B0001AVZA8", "B0006J28LO", "B000WTVZHQ", "B0057P4SAQ", "B0001I55R4", "B00005V5NS", "B00AEFYNG8", "B007XTDWKQ", "B001ECDVJU", "0783230486", "B00066FBQG"], "bought_together": ["B002VWNIBI", "6305212112"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00DDT0JB0", "B00AEFYK5M", "B00004TJKK", "B003ASLJK4"]}, "price": 24.5, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 133435}, "asin": "0784011648", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51JR83516RL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "On Golden Pond"}
{"description": "Robin Williams won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor, and actors Matt Damon and Ben Affleck nabbed one for Best Original Screenplay, but the feel-good hitGood Will Huntingtriumphs because of its gifted director, Gus Van Sant. The unconventional director (My Own Private Idaho,Drugstore Cowboy) saves a script marred by vanity and clunky character development by yanking soulful, touching performances out of his entire cast (amazingly, even one by Williams that's relatively schtick-free). Van Sant pulls off the equivalent of what George Cukor accomplished for women's melodrama in the '30s and '40s: He's crafted an intelligent, unabashedly emotional male weepie about men trying to find inner-wisdom.Matt Damon stars as Will Hunting, a closet math genius who ignores his gift in favor of nightly boozing and fighting with South Boston buddies (co-writer Ben Affleck among them). While working as a university janitor, he solves an impossible calculus problem scribbled on a hallway blackboard and reluctantly becomes the prodigy of an arrogant MIT professor (Stellan Skarsg&#229;rd). Damon only avoids prison by agreeing to see psychiatrists, all of whom he mocks or psychologically destroys until he meets his match in the professor's former childhood friend, played by Williams. Both doctor and patient are haunted by the past, and as mutual respect develops, the healing process begins. The film's beauty lies not with grand climaxes, but with small, quiet moments. Scenes such as Affleck's clumsy pep talk to Damon while they drink beer after work, or any number of therapy session between Williams and Damon offer poignant looks at the awkward ways men show affection and feeling for one another.--Dave McCoy", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000FVQLQQ", "B000P0J0EW", "6305144168", "B0043X1FL8", "B00000IQV7", "B00AEFY0F2", "B0000YEEGM", "B00JPQ1INI", "B004FQX5B6", "0800141741", "B00011CZRE", "B00AEFXESQ", "B00562D3Y2", "B00125WAWS", "0783226845", "B003ASLJQS", "B00005JLRZ", "B000M341QE", "B0034G4P7G", "B002ZG99N6", "B000N4RAR4", "0767811100", "6305428352", "B000P0J0EM", "B00009W5CA", "B002NZK5UK", "B003ASLJO0", "B00003CWQR", "B004SIP7VM", "B000B8QG22", "B00005V9HH", "B001F34HRS", "B004AOECXI", "B000N6U0E2", "B00AEFXYJA", "079284646X", "B0043X1FM2", "B00AEFY17E", "B000066HAS", "B000PHVZNE", "B003AWRMC4", "B00000G3PA", "B00AEBB9F0", "B00005JKWX", "B000MZHW40", "B000Z8GZYW", "B0018CWW5K", "B000P0J0C4", "B000P0J09M", "B00004BZIY", "B00B0U2SFE", "B003AWRMCE", "B00001ZWUS", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00005B6JZ", "B00005JLSB", "B0002ZDVEU", "6305428271", "B000FKO5QK", "B00AEBB9SM", "B00007GZR5", "B001SN78JO", "B000QQLVPQ", "630587493X", "B0001ADAVK", "B004WCTLNY", "0792843592", "B00AEBBA36", "B000FVQLRA", "B00AEFXXMI", "B000XJD33O", "B0002WZTOI", "B00004XPPG", "B00008G8M4", "B00AEBB9LO", "B000056VP4", "B006VRRGNK", "6305313687", "B0006FYOTC", "B001QERPAC", "B002O3Z4WK", "B001680M26", "B00AEFY4CG", "B000YDBPAM", "B0068FZ0GK", "0767836359", "B00005JN2Z", "B000765IJK", "B00008NFR4", "630471193X", "B002NZK5VO", "B000EGDB10", "B000068MBX", "B00000J122", "B00AMSLDTM", "B000MNOX94", "B000R4SMCW", "B00009AOBI", "B000XR9L50", "B00005JOC9"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000P0J0EW", "B000M341QE", "0783226845", "B002ZG99N6"]}, "price": 8.67, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 107799}, "asin": "0788814664", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51EQNMPT51L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Good Will Hunting"}
{"description": "From the moment that Prince Eric's ship emerged from the fog in the opening credits it was apparent that Disney had somehow, suddenly recaptured that \"magic\" that had been dormant for thirty years. In the tale of a headstrong young mermaid who yearns to \"spend a day, warm on the sand,\" Ariel trades her voice to Ursula, the Sea Witch (classically voiced by Pat Carroll), for a pair of legs.

{"description": "Peter Panhas a special place in the realm of classic animated  Disney films: it instills an element of childlike wonder. The 1953 version of James M. Barrie's story is colorfully told and keeps on the straight and narrow of the book. Barrie's wondrous focus on child's play is the key to its longevity: kids who don't grow up, shadows that run away from their owners, pirates, a fairy, and the magic ability to fly. In short, you can't help wishing the adventure would happen to you. Fueled by a few memorable songs (the stunner being \"You Can Fly\") and the strong impression of the pixie fairy Tinkerbell and the goofy Captain Hook, Disney's version of this story neither supplants nor lessens the Broadway version with Mary Martin that was produced for television the same decade. Unlike some classics,Peter Pannever ages along the way.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302642248", "0788812807", "0788802194", "155890641X", "0788812408", "0788806270", "6302320402", "6304401132", "6304500831", "6302526574", "6303314015", "6302787068", "6300274268", "6300274195", "B000035Z2S", "6305229449", "0788805843", "6304089767", "6302178924", "6303983812", "6302961572", "6300275310", "6304400551", "B0000AQZYM", "6305319138", "B00005JKDQ", "0788803743", "B00005JKX3", "0788805533", "6304290888", "6303929338", "B00003CX7L", "6305326940", "6304100507", "6302158095", "6304400225", "6305940932", "B00004R99N", "6301390725", "B00003CXQX", "B00000ICHA", "6303534422", "B00005JL95", "6304501153", "6304978286", "6302426200", "0788812440", "6301991311", "6304089201", "6300274608", "B00003CXHR", "B00005RDVV", "B00005T7H6", "6302484359", "B00000JS61", "6303036813", "6305942285", "1558906150", "B0000E32WB", "B00005RRG3", "B00004R99I", "B003H9M1Q2", "6304873441", "1558901892", "B000035Z46", "B00335EQ0E", "B00005K9OA", "B00003CWPW", "B00005LL26", "0788811002", "0788807307", "6304400381", "0788810634", "B00CTQWJEI", "B00016JF2W", "B00004REYY", "6304155972", "6304401736", "0788812181", "B00005RRG6", "6303122647", "B000JBWWRO", "B000B8QG4A", "6303939015", "B0000VV4W2", "B00EV1YZ96", "B000009CTR", "B00003CXQ6", "B00000J2JA", "630169774X", "B0000524CZ", "B000028U3S", "B00GDT5T9Y", "0790748266", "B00005RRG5", "B0013ND30M", "6303486894", "6304492952", "B001ILFUDC"], "bought_together": ["6302642248", "155890641X"], "also_viewed": ["0788802194", "0788806270", "6302642248", "0788812408", "6304500831", "155890641X", "6302320402", "0788812807", "6304401132", "6303314015", "6302526574", "0788805843", "6302787068", "6300274195", "6304290888", "B000035Z2S", "6303983812", "0788805533", "6300275310", "6304089767", "6300274268", "6302178924", "6305319138", "6302158095", "6302961572", "6303534422", "6305229449", "6303929338", "B00005JKDQ", "6304100507", "6305326940", "B00003CXQX", "B0000AQZYM", "6304400551", "B00004R99N", "6305940932", "6304978286", "B00003CX7L", "B00005JL95", "6303036813", "6302426200", "6304400225", "B000FP5PPA", "6304501153", "B000B8QG4A", "B0007KTBIU", "6301991311", "6301390725", "B003ZHVJGO", "B00005JKX3", "0788812440", "6304089201", "B00GDT4M1A", "B00335EQ0E", "B0000524CZ", "B0000E32WB", "6304873441", "B0001HAISG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 31071}, "categories": [["CDs & Vinyl", "Children's Music", "Disney"], ["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.89, "brand": "Disney", "asin": "078881172X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51A4yXnL4YL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Peter Pan (45th Anniversary Limited Edition) [VHS]"}

As with the firstBatmanfeature, director Tim Burton brings his distinct visual style to the frantic action, but this time there's a darker malevolence lurking beneath all that extraordinary production design.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000P0J06K", "B001OST0LW", "B001OST0M6", "B00005JNJV", "B004LWZWGA", "B001GZ6QC4", "B00005LOUK", "B000IJ79WU", "B001ECDVKE", "B000IJ79XE", "B0000959N0", "B0006L0LOS", "B000IJ79X4", "B000A9QKLO", "B00AEBBA72", "B0000VD04M", "B0000AC8LI", "B000IJ79UW", "B00008G8M5", "B004LWZWFQ", "B000A9QKL4", "B004LWZW42", "B008JFUPFI", "B000AYELVA", "B001CDR1FG", "B001AGXEAG", "B000J10EQU", "B001DHXT20", "B00005JMQW", "B002VWNIDG", "B004SIP9O2", "B004YJMQHI", "B0087ZG7NO", "B000AQOHNA", "B000AYELVU", "B00005JKCH", "B00GZ0ML2Y", "B00005JNTU", "B000UR9T8C", "B001VLBDD0", "B00DP9MDE4", "B001CK1D44", "B00AEBBAEK", "B000A9QKLE", "B007K3JFUQ", "B000VI70QS", "B00004Y87O", "B009JBWOU0", "B002GHHHOM", "B00005JKWJ", "B001QB9H1U", "B003UGLCIA", "B00007AJGH", "B0009UZG28", "B004SIP9P6", "B000035Z5H", "B00A2LFXVI", "0780630890", "B0000696I0", "B004EPZ07K", "B001OQCV6A", "B000VR0570", "B004EPYZT4", "B000OT6V64", "B001GCUO1Q", "B000RIWAVW", "6304698739", "B000O77SRC", "B000IJ79VQ", "B0014Z4ON4", "0780624890", "B004SIP6WW", "B005LAIH54", "B00003CY5Y", "B0000VCZMK", "6305869103", "B0001BKAEY", "B0090SI56Y", "B000068MBS", "B004SIP9MY", "B00AEBB9NM", "B0001GOH6Q", "B004LWZW4M", "B000GETUDI", "B000B7QCGS", "B000CSTK42", "B000FFJYBG", "B008JFUS0U", "B000RW3VCK", "B005LAIHYU", "B00005T7I2", "B0000B00KB", "B00E5I2M6I", "B001DTPZNY", "B004P7CN7W", "B001BGS17Q", "B001AJIHC8", "B005COPWZW", "B005G4TJUC", "B001QTXM5Y"], "bought_together": ["B000P0J06K", "B001OST0LW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002GSXKN8", "B000P0J06K", "B00005JNJV", "B001OST0LW"]}, "price": 8.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 142329}, "asin": "0790730960", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41SK0R2QFEL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Batman Returns (1992)"}
{"description": "Stanley Kubrick dissects the nature of violence in this darkly ironic, near-future satire, adapted from Anthony Burgess's novel, complete with \"Nadsat\" slang. Classical music-loving proto-punk Alex (Malcolm McDowell) and his \"Droogs\" spend their nights getting high at the Korova Milkbar before embarking on \"a little of the old ultraviolence,\" such as terrorizing a writer, Mr. Alexander (Patrick Magee), and gang raping his wife (who later dies as a result). After Alex is jailed for bludgeoning the Cat Lady (Miriam Karlin) to death with one of her phallic sculptures, Alex submits to the Ludovico behavior modification technique to earn his freedom; he's conditioned to abhor violence through watching gory movies, and even his adored Beethoven is turned against him. Returned to the world defenseless, Alex becomes the victim of his prior victims, with Mr. Alexander using Beethoven's Ninth to inflict the greatest pain of all. When society sees what the state has done to Alex, however, the politically expedient move is made.", "related": {"also_bought": ["0790734079", "0790705141", "B00004U8PA", "B00000FZCU", "6303953425", "6304484054", "0783235607", "6304039220", "630268644X", "B00006G8O1", "0790700506", "B0002G2B2W", "6305576173", "B000059HCI", "B00008X5J1", "0792837797", "B00000J2KZ", "6300267881", "6301977742", "6300216713", "6300269132", "B00000I1DI", "6302783356", "6300214826", "6305095566", "B00005JLET", "6302054982", "0800103106", "6302201845", "6302798450", "B00000J2L7", "6304994540", "6303686796", "B00005PJ8I", "6300216500", "0783228317", "6303107338", "6304935811", "B00004W5UA", "6302610702", "0783246641", "6300183211", "6302921058", "0792842111", "B00004T37H", "B00002E285", "B00003CXE6", "B000007OY0", "6301971582", "6300184064", "B00005LL26", "0790736039"], "bought_together": ["0790734079", "0790705141"], "also_viewed": ["0393312836", "0790705141", "B0013FSXT6", "B00GGAK0FS", "B008RO875Q", "B004O724M2", "B00004TLMC", "B00023NRSM", "B008M4MB8K", "6305440093", "6303953425", "6303939015", "6303148387", "6303861733", "B00003CXB4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 296220}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.95, "brand": "", "asin": "0790701022", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51EV1DQCCGL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "A Clockwork Orange"}
{"description": "Thanks to the ambitious vision of director Tim Burton, the blockbuster hit of 1989 delivers the goods despite an occasionally spotty script, giving the caped crusader a thorough overhaul in keeping with the crime fighter's evolution in DC Comics. Michael Keaton strikes just the right mood as the brooding &quot;Dark Knight&quot; of Gotham City; Kim Basinger plays Gotham's intrepid reporter Vicki Vale; and Jack Nicholson goes wild as the maniacal and scene-stealing Joker, who plots a takeover of the city with his lethal Smilex gas. Triumphant Oscar-winning production design by the late Anton Furst turnsBatmaninto a visual feast, and Burton brilliantly establishes a darkly mythic approach to Batman's legacy.

{"description": "Stanley Kubrick'sThe Shiningis less an adaptation of Stephen King's bestselling horror novel than a complete reimagining of it from the inside out. In King's book, the Overlook Hotel is a haunted place that takes possession of its off-season caretaker and provokes him to murderous rage against his wife and young son. Kubrick's movie is an existential Road Runner cartoon (his steadicam scurrying through the hotel's labyrinthine hallways), in which the cavernously empty spaces inside the Overlook mirror the emptiness in the soul of the blocked writer, who's settled in for a long winter's hibernation. As many have pointed out, King's protagonist goes mad, but Kubrick's Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) is Looney Tunes from the moment we meet him--all arching eyebrows and mischievous grin. (Both Nicholson and Shelley Duvall reach new levels of hysteria in their performances, driven to extremes by the director's fanatical demands for take after take after take.)The Shiningis terrifying--but not in the way fans of the novel might expect. When it was redone as a TV miniseries (reportedly because of King's dissatisfaction with the Kubrick film), the famous topiary-animal attack (which was deemed impossible to film in 1980) was there--but the deeper horror was lost. Kubrick'sThe Shininggets under your skin and chills your bones; it stays with you, inhabits you, haunts you. And there's no place to hide...--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300267881", "0790734079", "B00005ATQA", "6302038308", "6300182770", "B0009RRUKW", "0783235607", "0783228317", "B00000J2KZ", "B00004RNAC", "0790736039", "B00023NRSM", "6304508611", "6300182878", "6302921058", "6304509154", "0783216084", "6300214087", "B00004W5UA", "6301427076", "630268644X", "B000003KHS", "B000AMW2TK", "0790700506", "6300181340", "6300214753", "6302054982", "0784011923", "6305363668", "6303686796", "6305095566", "630021639X", "6302822688", "6305576173", "0783246641", "6304994540", "6303953425", "B00004U8PA", "0792158261", "0792100085", "6300213986", "6300189015", "630533577X", "6300214826", "0792846303", "6304288433", "6300147630", "0792842111", "B000007OY0", "0790741512", "6302158176", "0792846311", "6300183416", "0800103106", "B000005PFL", "6300183211", "0790733927", "6301666569", "6301871952", "0767825411", "630339406X", "6303109950", "6300216500", "6300214192", "6300262731", "6303257674", "6304214502", "630018627X", "6300214311", "1558807381", "0792839234", "0767819187", "B00005B238", "0790731975", "6303579388", "B000059HFB", "6302798450", "B00000FZCU", "6303651461", "6303566391", "6302642175", "6301971582", "6300218058", "6301094352", "6300184064", "6300181278", "6304457383", "6300214672", "6300262855", "0800125762", "6303257305"], "bought_together": ["0790734079"], "also_viewed": ["6300147630", "6300182878", "B00005ATQA", "6300189015", "6300267881", "B00023NRSM", "6300213005", "6303953425", "0307743659", "6303148352", "0790734079", "B001AQT0Z4", "6300183211", "0784011923", "B00BBND56G", "0788806270"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 268792}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.0, "brand": "", "asin": "0790705141", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5106FV0S4PL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Shining [VHS]"}
{"description": "The most viscerally frightening and disturbing homicidal-maniac picture sinceThe Silence of the Lambs,Sevenis based on an idea that's both gruesome and ingenious. A serial killer forces each of his victims to die by acting out one of the seven deadly sins. The murder scene is then artfully arranged into a grotesque tableau, a graphic illustration of each mortal vice. From the jittery opening credits to the horrifying (and seemingly inescapable) concluding twist, director David Fincher immerses us in a murky urban twilight where everything seems to be rotting, rusting, or molding; the air is cold and heavy with dread. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt are the detectives who skillfully track down the killer--all the while unaware that he has been closing in on them, as well. Gwyneth Paltrow and Kevin Spacey are also featured, but it is director Fincher and the ominous, overwhelmingly oppressive atmosphere of doom that he creates that are the real stars of the film. It's a terrific date movie--for vampires.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005V9HH", "B0007DFJ0G", "B000M341QE", "0783240295", "B00003CXZ4", "6305313687", "B004SIP8ZM", "B000P0J0EW", "B000LP6KNU", "B000P0J09M", "B000P0J0AG", "B000069HZP", "B004SIP95G", "B0009A40ES", "B0007PALZ2", "B002NZK5RI", "B002AF4Y9G", "B00AEBB89W", "B004SIP7VM", "B00AEFXQ9S", "B00004BZIY", "B003ASLJO0", "B00003CXWV", "B00096S49Y", "B00AEFYF2K", "B004SIP7ZS", "B00AEBB8NI", "B00008975Z", "B002T9H2LA", "B00005JLKN", "B000LC55F2", "0767802519", "B004FQX5B6", "B002VWNIEA", "B004SIP7TE", "B004SIP9Z6", "B00AEFXEGS", "0792846435", "B00003CXSP", "B002VWNICC", "B00AEFXT1S", "B000C20VPA", "B00AEFXESQ", "B000P0J0EM", "B000093FLA", "B002ZG99N6", "B002NZK5VO", "B003LR5BD0", "B002VWNIDG", "B000I2J736", "B0001FR3IQ", "B00AEFYYH6", "B000F5GNX8", "B002ZG980U", "B00005JN0W", "B00005JMJG", "B0000AC8LR", "B003ASLJQI", "B000E5N684", "B002XMGGK6", "B003HKN52U", "B00AP2DC94", "B00001ZWUS", "B000A2UBN4", "B000244GCW", "B000A7DVR2", "B002GHHHN8", "B00004WG2F", "B00AEFXKUI", "B001R3YRG2", "B002NZK5UU", "B00004XPPG", "B0034G4P7G", "B000FKO5QK", "B0009MDPYM", "B000NVT0SO", "B003ASLJQS", "B00005JPD0", "B00005JKWX", "B000YAF4MA", "B00005JKIS", "6305065551", "0783229526", "0783233477", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B002CPMB9O", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00005JA8B", "B00AEFXYJA", "B0000YEEGM", "B007D5E7C2", "B0002V7ON8", "B000N6U0E2", "B00AEFY5B6", "B00AEBB8LA", "6305718954", "B002AT8K9W", "B00AMSLDTM", "B000FS9FCG"], "bought_together": ["B0007DFJ0G", "6305313687"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004LWZW4M", "B00005V9HH", "B0007DFJ0G", "B000P0J0EW"]}, "price": 13.96, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 172718}, "asin": "0790729989", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51VQ890AJML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Seven (Widescreen)"}
{"description": "When Prince's dazzling and dynamicPurple Rain(movie and soundtrack album) and the hypnotic hit single &quot;When Doves Cry&quot; exploded onto the pop-culture scene in 1984, it seemed there was nothing the purple one couldn't do. The film is basically a feature-length music video, but no musician has ever had a better big-screen showcase for his many talents.  The plot is really just a theme (about the son of an abusive father struggling not to continue the pattern) upon which to hang some of Prince's most dazzling songs (including &quot;Let's Go Crazy&quot; and the title tune), and some sizzling live-concert numbers.  Apollonia Kotero is ravishing as the romantic interest, and Morris Day and the Time provide some terrific musical competition.Purple Rainis an essential artifact of the mid-'80s pop Zeitgeist. Prince took home an Oscar for the song score.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0002CTSUO", "B0002CTSV8", "B000002L68", "B00007BK2Q", "B0015UKX7E", "B0000AVHDC", "B00005M989", "B000002KY8", "B000089738", "B00005JD5H", "B000002MNF", "B000002LUY", "B000002L7R", "B000051YMS", "B000E6EHI6", "B000B5XOSY", "B009H3LOBK", "B000002L9B", "6305428409", "B000P0J092", "B00AEFYE08", "B00AEBB9AA", "B000002MN5", "B000002KMV", "B00AEBB9ZK", "B000002KKN", "B000002LHX", "B000002L8Z", "B000BOH8X2", "B002GSXKOM", "B0000DIXDR", "B00AEFYG3S", "B000002LBM", "B0041QSZS8", "B000JLTRH2", "B000TLOMPE", "B00007AJG1", "B002CWKU36", "B0000TWMWA", "B000002KMT", "B00005JD5J", "B00D24CUXG", "B00007AJFE", "B0000696I2", "B000002L66", "B00BTYPWDQ", "B00008977B", "1558908390", "B00AEFY74G", "B0033TJATW", "6305459541", "B00005JLG1", "B000002LE6", "6305505780", "B000002MNA", "B003BV8I3Q", "B0000YEE6M", "B00005RZPQ", "1476705496", "B000006L4R", "B0000549B2", "6305310963", "B00003CY51", "B00007ELEO", "B0008JIJ2E", "B000002MT0", "B0000DD76S", "B000002KLP", "B00ADUJI1Y", "B000065V3H", "B0000TWMWK", "B000002UJC", "B000E33W1W", "B00AEFXZJE", "B00AEFY5TI", "B00AEFY4CG", "B002VWNICM", "B0041QSZ9M", "B000BUE5FA", "B00009AOBI", "B002NZK5TG", "B004SIP93S", "B00AEFXP8K", "0767813901", "B000EAT23W", "B000A50460", "B00AEFYRP0", "6304821832", "B00005B1X4", "B00465I1CE", "B0053TWV46", "0783230389", "B00003W8NT", "B004GJYRKA", "B001JV5BF8", "B00066FAQW", "B00005JL72", "B000053VBA", "B0023SJHEW"], "bought_together": ["B0002CTSV8", "B0002CTSUO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000002L68", "B000YIGNHW", "B0002CTSV8", "B00005M989"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 7366}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.58, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "0790731533", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51OlsAN5XhL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Purple Rain"}
{"description": "When Ridley Scott's cut ofBlade Runnerwas finally released in 1993, one had to wonder why the studio hadn't done it right the first time--11 years earlier. This version is so much better, mostly because of what's been eliminated (the ludicrous and redundant voice-over narration and the phony happy ending) rather than what's been added (a bit more character development and a brief unicorn dream). Star Harrison Ford originally recorded the narration under duress at the insistence of Warner Bros. executives who thought the story needed further \"explanation\"; he later confessed that he thought if he did it badly they wouldn't use it. (Moral: Never overestimate the taste of movie executives.) The movie's spectacular futuristic vision of Los Angeles--a perpetually dark and rainy metropolis that's the nightmare antithesis of \"Sunny Southern California\"--is still its most seductive feature, an otherworldly atmosphere in which you can immerse yourself. The movie's shadowy visual style, along with its classic private-detective/murder-mystery plot line (with Ford on the trail of a murderous android, or \"replicant\"), makesBlade Runnerone of the few science fiction pictures to legitimately claim a place in the film noir tradition. And, as in the best noir, the sleuth discovers a whole lot more (about himself and the people he encounters) than he anticipates.... With Sean Young, Edward James Olmos, Daryl Hannah, Rutger Hauer, and M. Emmet Walsh.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783225903", "B004L9GMBC", "0783226063", "B00000ILDD", "0800195175", "B0018O4YT0", "B0007PALZ2", "B00004Y87O", "B003ELKNH2", "B00AEFYDM2", "B0002CHIKG", "B00005ATQB", "B00005JL78", "0790729342", "B0045HCJKS", "0767830555", "B0002CHK1S", "B00005N5S5", "B000063JDE", "B000P0J0AQ", "B00005R2IS", "B0013LL2Z2", "B00I9TDMRM", "B0045HCJ9O", "B008MIMWP8", "B0045HCJ0S", "B00005JLWN", "B00005N7Z1", "B000YBKO6U", "B0006GAOJA", "B0007DFJ0G", "B001WLMOL4", "B00003CXXP", "6304698798", "B00000JSJC", "B000286RP2", "B003AWRMCE", "B0040QYROA", "0783228457", "B004SIP9Z6", "B002ZG980U", "079284646X", "B00079Z9VO", "B002VWNIAY", "B00005J75F", "B005LAIHXQ", "B000VECAD0", "B0000VCZK2", "B00005PJ8T", "0345404475", "B001DJLD1M", "0792839056", "B0045HCJ9E", "B0050FXDDQ", "B0045HCJGC", "B004SIP95G", "B007STBUHI", "B00006ADD5", "B00GHJ1YUI", "B003ZXDP0Q", "B000A7DVR2", "0790731932", "B000NA1WGS", "B00AMSLDTM", "B008JFUN50", "B0068FZ0O2", "B000QUCQX8", "B000E6ESEO", "B00AEFXN9G", "B004FQX5B6", "B0002KVUKM", "B0016I0AJG", "B007FQXEWI", "B000N6TX1I", "B002VWNIDG", "B00ENNBZ68", "B00K5EJHGO", "B001VLBDD0", "078401213X", "0780022343", "B0018CMJSU", "B005LAII3A", "B000OVLBHG", "B006TTC5HC", "B0049985XW", "B0000844I8", "B00005JKFR", "B00AEFY3MC", "B000BZISSU", "0783226837", "6305133476", "B000022TSY", "B000FS9FCG", "B00070FX5U", "B008MIMWQW", "B00AEBBADG", "B004GJYRKA", "B002Z7FWBI", "B000BR9S96", "B00000K3TS"], "bought_together": ["B004L9GMBC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005LAIHXQ", "B009JBWOU0", "B00HUCF7AO", "B0018O4YT0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 68358}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 10.21, "brand": "WARNER BROTHERS", "asin": "0790729628", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ST8TQP63L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)"}
{"description": "Before makingBatman, director Tim Burton and star Michael Keaton teamed up for this popular black comedy about a young couple (Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin) whose premature death leads them to a series of wildly bizarre afterlife exploits. As ghosts in their own New England home, they're faced with the challenge of scaring off the pretentious new owners (Catherine O'Hara and Jeffrey Jones), whose daughter (Winona Ryder) has an affinity for all things morbid. Keaton plays the mischievous Beetlejuice, a freelance &quot;bio-exorcist&quot; who's got an evil agenda behind his plot to help the young undead newlyweds.

{"description": "It's enlightening to view Tim Burton'sMars Attacks!as his twisted satire of the blockbuster filmIndependence Day, which was released earlier the same year, although the movies were in production simultaneously. Burton's eye-popping, schlock tribute to 1950s UFO movies actually plays better on video than it did in theaters. The idea of invading aliens ray gunning the big-name movie stars in the cast is a cleverly subversive one, and the bulb-headed, funny-sounding animated Martians are pretty nifty, but it all seemed to be spread thin on the big screen. On video, however, the movie's kooky humor seems a bit more concentrated.

{"description": "Michael Crichton's bestselling novel was both a high-tech thriller and source of controversy with its hot-button plot about a man's charge of sexual harassment against a female colleague and former lover. The movie, directed by Barry Levinson, turned these issues into a prurient thriller gussied up in glossy production values, virtual reality computer graphics, and steamy sex between Michael Douglas and Demi Moore. Having cornered the market on roles for men whose brains are located south of their waistline, Douglas is well cast as the computer-industry guy who loses a plush promotion to the opportunistic Moore, and he's perfected the expression of paranoid panic. If you don't think about it too much, this is one of those films that can draw you into its manipulative web and really grab your attention.Disclosureis more entertaining than thought provoking (because the filmmakers basically danced around the story's potential controversy), but there's enough star power and visual glitz to make this an enjoyable ride.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEFXX9Q", "B002AT8KAG", "B000E5N684", "B00005Y1UX", "0767810872", "B0043X1FNQ", "B00008L3S6", "6305308837", "B0045HCJ8K", "B00AEFXT1S", "6305213305", "B002QW7AMG", "B00009WVSL", "B00AEFXYJA", "B0045HCIYA", "6305310335", "B000EQ5SRK", "B00AEFYC96", "B000069HZP", "B00026ZD04", "B00013RC66", "0792159659", "B000FS9UKI", "B00096S49Y", "B00015YVDG", "B00AEBB9UK", "B000CEV3M8", "B00000K3TU", "B00006RCNY", "6305262268", "B002NZK5R8", "B002NZK5UU", "B00AEFYD2M", "B00AEFXKZ8", "B00BLN4UKQ", "B00004Y87P", "B003ASLJIQ", "B002NZK5VO", "B00008CMRK", "B000HC2LHG", "0783240295", "B00AEFXBPM", "B00005B6JZ", "B000E5KURY", "B00AEBBA2W", "630542828X", "1558908315", "B001ECDVK4", "B00AP2DC94", "B000PMFS2I", "B002AS463W", "B00AEFXIIW", "B002NZK5RI", "B000A2UBN4", "B000P5FH3K", "0792844874", "B00AEFYRP0", "0767817729", "B002O3Z4WK", "B00002E23C", "B0007IO6NM", "B00AEFXEGS", "B00AEFYF2K", "B007FQXEWI", "B000ENC5YW", "B002AS464Q", "B00008L3U6", "B00006HAWN", "B000055Y0Y", "B005NKIPUY", "B0006HBZBA", "B00AEFY4CG", "B00005ATZT", "6304779631", "B000063US3", "B0009X75PQ", "0767802616", "B00005A3KV", "B0045HCJ5S", "B001NY4WYC", "B00005Y1UV", "B00005JA9F", "B0043X1FKY", "B0038Z5T4Q", "0792846443", "6305213283", "B004EPYZP8", "B004IK30MI", "B000G5SILC", "B00013RC7K", "B0006N2EZ0", "6305428115", "B001I2EQUY", "B00000J11D", "B00006L92K", "B000B8GT92", "0800141806", "0767809726", "6304806434"], "bought_together": ["B00AEFXX9Q", "B002AT8KAG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000E5N684", "B002AT8KAG", "B00AMSLDX8", "B00AEFXX9Q"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 18565}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.49, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "0790730979", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51QB3T7KRHL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Disclosure"}
{"description": "The satirical sensibilities of writer Peter Shaffer and director Milos Forman (One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest) were ideally matched in this Oscar-winning movie adaptation of Shaffer's hit play about the rivalry between two composers in the court of Austrian Emperor Joseph II--official royal composer Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham), and the younger but superior prodigy Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce). The conceit is absolutely delicious: Salieri secretly loathes Mozart's crude and bratty personality, but is astounded by the beauty of his music. That's the heart of Salieri's torment--although he's in a unique position to recognize and cultivate both Mozart's talent and career, he's also consumed with envy and insecurity in the face of such genius. That such magnificent music should come from such a vulgar little creature strikes Salieri as one of God's cruelest jokes, and it drives him insane.Amadeuscreates peculiar and delightful contrasts between the impeccably re-created details of its lavish period setting and the jarring (but humorously refreshing and unstuffy) modern tone of its dialogue and performances--all of which serve to remind us that these were people before they became enshrined in historical and artistic legend. Jeffrey Jones, best-known as Ferris Bueller's principal, is particularly wonderful as the bumbling emperor (with the voice of a modern midlevel businessman). The film's eight Oscars include statuettes for Best Director Forman, Best Actor Abraham (Hulce was also nominated), Best Screenplay, and Best Picture.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305261296", "B00000K3AN", "6305470448", "6302250269", "0800132009", "0790743213", "B000067JAU", "6304071876"], "bought_together": ["6305261296"], "also_viewed": ["6303168507"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 287790}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.88, "brand": "", "asin": "0790734060", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/512Y1EHFXCL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Amadeus [VHS]"}

{"description": "A favorite film of some of the world's greatest filmmakers, including Martin Scorsese and Steven Spielberg, John Ford'sThe Searchershas earned its place in the legacy of great American films for a variety of reasons. Perhaps most notably, it's the definitive role for John Wayne as an icon of the classic Western--the hero (or antihero) who must stand alone according to the unwritten code of the West. The story takes place in Texas in 1868; Wayne plays Ethan Edwards, a Confederate veteran who visits his brother and sister-in-law at their ranch and is horrified when they are killed by marauding Comanches. Ethan's search for a surviving niece (played by young Natalie Wood) becomes an all-consuming obsession. With the help of a family friend (Jeffrey Hunter) who is himself part Cherokee, Ethan hits the trail on a five-year quest for revenge. At the peak of his masterful talent, director Ford crafts this classic tale as an embittered examination of racism and blind hatred, provoking Wayne to give one of the best performances of his career. As with many of Ford's classic Westerns,The Searchersmust contend with revisionism in its stereotypical treatment of \"savage\" Native Americans, and the film's visual beauty (the final shot is one of the great images in all of Western culture) is compromised by some uneven performances and stilted dialogue. Still, this is undeniably one of the greatest Westerns ever made.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300268470", "630197705X", "0792106989", "6301325508", "0782008348", "6303057225", "6300181588", "6300268799", "0792102320", "6301797922", "6301802330", "6303192254", "0792838556", "6301805518", "6304071876", "6301798759", "6300184951", "6300269884", "6300267830", "1555265952", "6300181715", "0792107128", "6303599052", "6300208281", "0783221347", "B00004RFFA", "6304457308", "6304457278", "079284517X", "6301977165", "6300268748", "B000051S3Z", "B001E419N8", "B000M7BEPQ", "B000GX4476", "0792110188", "6301628454", "6300988473", "0800132009", "B000059HGY", "6301805615", "B00004WZR1", "6301670159", "0792107683", "630310374X", "0783235607", "6303942830", "6302884438", "6305237115", "630150528X", "0792834879", "0790743213", "0783235593", "6304259131", "6301798503", "630018224X", "6302130379", "B000006N70", "6304935811"], "also_viewed": ["6303599052", "6303168507", "6300269884", "6301802330", "0792106989"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 293111}, "asin": "0790736918", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51G79RSPRAL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Searchers [VHS]"}
{"description": "Steven Seagal can consider himself lucky if he ever makes a better movie than this one, which was appropriately dubbed &quot;Die Hardon a battleship&quot; when released in 1992.

They're crazed psychotics who seize control of the ship's nuclear arsenal, but they don't know that Seagal--as the ship's cook, no less--is a former Navy hero, lurking in the shadows and waiting to spoil their nefarious scheme.

{"description": "Demonstrations of classic military tactical procedures and excellent footage of vintage aircraft (like the rare B-36), combine here to give viewers a cold war primer on the Air Force's defense capabilities, circa 1955. Former World War II pilot James Stewart is called out of retirement to assist in the strengthening of the Strategic Air Command, the new bomber forces that are America's first line of defense against the Russian nuclear threat.

{"description": "Mel Gibson's Oscar-winning 1995Braveheartis an impassioned epic about William Wallace, the 13th-century Scottish leader of a popular revolt against England's tyrannical Edward I (Patrick McGoohan). Gibson cannily plays Wallace as a man trying to stay out of history's way until events force his hand, an attribute that instantly resonates with several of the actor's best-known roles, especiallyMad Max. The subsequent camaraderie and courage Wallace shares in the field with fellow warriors is pure enough and inspiring enough to bring envy to a viewer, and even as things go wrong for Wallace in the second half, the film does not easily cave in to a somber tone. One of the most impressive elements is the originality with which Gibson films battle scenes, featuring hundreds of extras wielding medieval weapons. After Eisenstein'sAlexander Nevsky, Orson Welles'sChimes at Midnight, and even Kenneth Branagh'sHenry V, you might think there is little new that could be done in creating scenes of ancient combat; yet Gibson does it.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00004XPQ6", "B00003CXE6", "6303953425", "6304935811", "B0001VL30O", "B000054OW2", "6302415853", "0790741512", "6304071876", "6301792734", "6303168507", "6303942830", "0800125762", "6300183211", "B000007OY0", "B000056BRF", "6300214540", "B000065U6Q", "B00004WIDB", "B00003CXTF", "B00007KK15", "079070546X", "B0000A36J1", "B00000K3AN", "6302482712", "6300263673", "6305169187", "0788811355", "B00003BE3X", "0800116917", "6304414099", "6303020089", "0792133153", "0790744589", "6302909023", "0800132009", "079212569X", "6300185095", "6303313345", "0767819462", "6304259131", "B00000K2SC", "0800199421", "B0001DI5W6", "B00005JLTM", "630018224X", "0790701251", "6304151306", "6303696813", "0790731274", "0792147618", "B00005RIJ3", "6301586026", "6302945089", "0783223218", "6305718792"], "bought_together": ["B00004XPQ6", "B00003CXE6"], "also_viewed": ["0792151712", "6303314015", "6301966988", "6303402348", "B00004WIDB", "0792116887", "6300213668", "0800125762", "B00004XPQ6", "0792842111", "B00003CXTF", "0788812408", "6302526574", "6303215734", "0788806270", "6300183211", "B00004U8P4", "0788802194"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 521725}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 0.5, "brand": "", "asin": "0792139771", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51PF2QYK62L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Braveheart (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]"}

{"description": "When the theatrical release of James Cameron'sTitanicwas delayed from July to December of 1997, media pundits speculated that Cameron's $200&nbsp;million disaster epic would cause the director's downfall, signal the end of the blockbuster era, and sink Paramount Studios as quickly as the ill-fated luxury liner had sunk on that fateful night of April&nbsp;14, 1912. Some studio executives were confident, others horrified, but the clarity of hindsight turned Cameron into an Oscar-winning genius, a shrewd businessman, and one of the most successful directors in the history of motion pictures.Titanicwould surpass the $1&nbsp;billion mark in global box-office receipts (largely due to multiple viewings, the majority by teenage girls), win 11&nbsp;Academy Awards including best picture and director, produce the best-selling movie soundtrack of all time, and make a global superstar of Leonardo DiCaprio. A bona fide pop-cultural phenomenon, the film has all the ingredients of a blockbuster (romance, passion, luxury, grand scale, a snidely villain, and an epic, life-threatening crisis), but Cameron's alchemy of these ingredients proved more popular than anyone could have predicted. His stroke of genius was to combine absolute authenticity with a pair of fictional lovers whose tragic fate would draw viewers into the heart-wrenching reality of theTitanicdisaster. As starving artist Jack Dawson and soon-to-be-married socialite Rose DeWitt Bukater, DiCaprio and Kate Winslet won the hearts of viewers around the world, and their brief but never-forgotten love affair provides the humanity that Cameron needed to turnTitanicinto an emotional experience. Present-day framing scenes (featuring Gloria Stuart as the 101-year-old Rose) add additional resonance to the story, and although some viewers proved vehemently immune to Cameron's manipulations, few can deny the production's impressive achievements. Although some of the computer-generated visual effects look artificial, others--such as the sunset silhouette ofTitanicduring its first evening at sea, or the climactic splitting of the ship's sinking hull--are state-of-the-art marvels. In terms of sets and costumes alone, the film is never less than astounding. More than anything else, however, the film's overwhelming popularity speaks for itself.Titanicis an event film and a monument to Cameron's risk-taking audacity, blending the tragic irony of theTitanicdisaster with just enough narrative invention to give the historical event its fullest and most timeless dramatic impact.Titanicis an epic love story on par withGone with the Wind, and like that earlier box-office phenomenon, it's a film for the ages.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305123616", "6304117752", "6301792734", "6303215734", "B00000JS61", "6304178352", "6303396623", "6303314015", "B00003CXTF", "0769403468", "6301734734", "6302936381", "6303300480", "6305368139", "B00005RRG3", "6302610702", "0792839846", "6300207919", "B000P0J0C4", "6304546262", "B000056BRF", "6304400551", "6303101267", "630150528X", "6303637574", "B000P0J0EW", "6305126062", "6302935148", "0800199421", "6304681496", "0792116887", "6301963911", "B0000DCGT1", "B00001IVED", "6305169187", "B00006RCST", "6300216721", "630197879X", "0800113055", "076780922X", "080010367X", "0800141326", "0800184319", "6304039522", "B000066AXC"], "bought_together": ["6305123616"], "also_viewed": ["B009VQHDSQ", "6303314015", "B0074JODXU", "B00003CXTF", "B003JQZXWW", "6302787068", "6301796535", "0788812807", "0788806270", "B00005JKDQ", "6304500831", "6305229449", "6304117752", "6300213668", "6304089767", "B0000AQZYM", "079213690X", "6303049079", "6305123616", "6303402348", "6301792734", "0788812408", "B00079HZSE", "B000035Z2S", "B00000K3AN", "0788805843", "6302526574", "B0000029YC", "6303534422", "6303215734", "B0070285YE", "B00008LDO9", "0783216084", "6304434340", "B00BBND56G", "0788805533", "6300183211", "6302320402", "6305750750", "B0002CHI3S", "0790748266", "6304143184", "B0000040CM", "B005X7H9SQ", "B00004RFHF", "B00005V1Z7", "6302814782", "6301572688", "B00000JS61", "B008SLUWZG", "6303257844", "B00078XGO2", "0790736039", "B0000040EJ", "B000065U6Q", "B00003CX7L", "B00000ADKZ", "6300263673", "6302178924"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 65950}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.47, "brand": "Paramount", "asin": "0792151712", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21BAWEVBJ1L.jpg", "title": "Titanic [VHS]"}
{"description": "The first, and only, X-rated film to win a best picture Academy Award, John Schlesinger'sMidnight Cowboyseems a lot less daring today (and has been reclassified as an R), but remains a fascinating time capsule of late-1960s sexual decadence in mainstream American cinema. In a career-making performance, Jon Voight plays Joe Buck, a naive Texas dishwasher who goes to the big city (New York) to make his fortune as a sexual hustler. Although enthusiastic about selling himself to rich ladies for stud services, he quickly finds it hard to make a living and eventually crashes in a seedy dump with a crippled petty thief named Ratzo Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman, doing one of his more effective &quot;stupid acting tricks,&quot; with a limp and a high-pitch rasp of a voice). Schlesinger's quick-cut, semi-psychedelic style has dated severely, as has his ruthlessly cynical approach to almost everybody but the lead characters. But at its heart the movie is a sad tale of friendship between a couple of losers lost in the big city, and with an ending no studio would approve today. It's a bit like an urbanOf Mice and Men, but where both guys are Lenny.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00079Z9VO", "0767830555", "B0006GANN2", "B000XJD34I", "B000022TSY", "B000RTB0R6", "B006TTC5HC", "B0010AN7Z4", "B0006GAOJA", "B004FQX5B6", "B00003CXBU", "6304907729", "B00005MEOU", "B00005M2CO", "B00AEFXN9G", "B0000549B1", "B0008ENHUI", "B0009S4IKQ", "B00005JKF6", "B003ELKNH2", "B000CNESTE", "B000ZM1MG4", "B00005AUKE", "B000BYA4HE", "B00006RCO2", "B00004XPPC", "B0006HBV3W", "B00011D1OK", "B00066FBQG", "B0002KPHZG", "B000BITV92", "B0010YVCI4", "B00AEFYSWM", "B000CEXEWA", "B000LPR6GA", "B0000YEEGM", "B00003CXB5", "B0001US8F8", "B000ZM1MGE", "0780021312", "B000CNESU8", "B0050FXDDQ", "B001EOQCMG", "B00006RCO1", "B00AATV07S", "B00782O7IY", "B00004TVUD", "B002VWNIBI", "0767827902", "076781326X", "B0049985XW", "0783240171", "B00012FXJ0", "B0087ZG7OI", "B0019L21GA", "B001GUYAZY", "6305918880", "B000EHSVS2", "B000KGGJ0Y", "B00000DQWS", "B00011D1OU", "B00002VWE0", "B00006RCO3", "B004SIP7F8", "B00AEFY6DI", "6304712936", "B003INBNOS", "B00AEBB95K", "B004L9GMBC", "079284646X", "B00AEBB9FA", "B003ZEQMH8", "B00AEBB89C", "B000LP6KNU", "B0019UGYK0", "B001D8W7EU", "B006FE83UE", "B000KJTGHO", "0792846109", "B0088XQBXQ", "B0087ZG7R0", "B007N31YH0", "B003O7I6SE", "B00AEFZDNA", "B000055Y0X", "B0019L770A", "B003LMPKSQ", "B000UJ48SQ", "B009NYF2GQ", "B000KX0IOA", "B004SIP9U6", "B00006ADD5", "B0045HCJTO", "0792838408", "B0045HCJ94", "B0045HCJ8U", "B000P0J09M", "B002VWNIAY", "B00008RH3J", "B005KQVE1S"], "bought_together": ["B00079Z9VO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004FQX5B6", "B006TTC5HC", "B0006GANN2", "B0000YEEGM"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 4113}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.99, "brand": "MGM", "asin": "0792833287", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51C3ME80X6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Midnight Cowboy"}
{"description": "One of those movies that helped usher out the era of action films that had plots that made any sense (and also helped reverse the direction of Patrick Swayze's career arc),Road Houseconcerns a handsome, existential bouncer in a rinky-dink honky-tonk who owns both a degree in philosophy and a Mercedes. And that's perhaps the most believable aspect of the whole movie. Swayze stars as Dalton, \"the best bouncer in the business,\" who runs afoul of Wesley (Ben Gazzara), the meanest SOB round these parts, by taking up with his former girlfriend, Doc (Kelly Lynch)--the only woman in town with an IQ approaching double digits, even if she had unfathomably hooked up with such a lowlife. Swayze had complained about being typecast as beefcake when this was made, but that didn't stop him from revealing as much skin as possible--even guys like him, as revealed in a luridly seedy scene in which one of Wesley's goons tells Dalton that he reminds him of the kind of boyfriend he had in prison (albeit in much saltier terms).

{"description": "When it was released during Hollywood's golden year of 1939,The Wizard of Ozdidn't start out as the perennial classic it has since become. The film did respectable business, but it wasn't until its debut on television that this family favorite saw its popularity soar. And whileOz's TV broadcasts are now controlled by media mogul Ted Turner (who owns the rights), the advent of home video has made this lively musical a mainstay in the staple diet of great American films. Young Dorothy Gale (Judy Garland), her dog, Toto, and her three companions on the Yellow Brick Road to Oz--the Tin Man (Jack Haley), the Cowardly Lion (Bert Lahr), and the Scarecrow (Ray Bolger)--have become pop-culture icons and central figures in the legacy of fantasy for children. As the Wicked Witch who covets Dorothy's enchanted ruby slippers, Margaret Hamilton has had the singular honor of scaring the wits out of children for more than six decades. The film's still as fresh, frightening, and funny as it was when first released. It may take some liberal detours from the original story by L. Frank Baum, but it's loyal to the Baum legacy while charting its own course as a spectacular film. Shot in glorious Technicolor, befitting its dynamic production design (Munchkinland alone is a psychedelic explosion of color and d&eacute;cor),The Wizard of Ozmay not appeal to every taste as the years go by, but it's required viewing for kids of all ages.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B005F96UJ6", "B0000VCZKM", "B00E9ZATKI", "0792839749", "B0087F7VSY", "B0090XLDKY", "B002M2Z3BA", "076781326X", "B00C7JGDBW", "B000P0J09W", "B000URDCC6", "B002HK9IDQ", "B0000DZ3EN", "B000RPCK2E", "B000065V42", "B001JV5BF8", "B0000AM6IY", "B00335EQ0E", "B005NFJAZS", "B003VS0CX8", "B0000VCZKW", "0062278010", "B002NZK5SW", "B0010X744G", "B00CQRN3QI", "B0009XT8ME", "B000HT3PGU", "B006VJ1AAI", "B00005RRG7", "B008H6GHEM", "B00GVFJ5QS", "B00HVBB140", "B002VWNIAY", "B000BT970O", "B002CLBJPK", "0060293233", "B00028HBES", "B00322XV8Q", "B00EV1YZ96", "B000AJJNIG", "B00AATV0WS", "B0054OGQM8", "1495421864", "0739060821", "B00AEFXMGU", "0792833759", "B00AMSQBNK", "B000TPTCP0", "B0009X75QU", "B00ITVMMOY", "B00005RRGB", "B0017Q0SJ4", "0767836324", "B004302N2Q", "084318017X", "B001GLX6UI", "B003YBW2Y4", "1402766254", "B00019GHU2", "B00003CXCQ", "B00AMSM9CW", "B00005JG6M", "B0047QLNUY", "B00GDT5T9Y", "B00447L4JG", "0767819659", "B00000JPH6", "B002BIGCXS", "B00G5G7EXY", "B0000AK7AB", "B006FE83UE", "B002VWNIBI", "B00005JL1P", "B001ILFUDC", "0800177258", "B000QQLVPQ", "B00005RDSQ", "B00JHH1ZN8", "B0006IINYQ", "B0015NORDW", "B002GHHHNS", "B0013ND30M", "0792838408", "B001AGXEAG", "B0047CG9F2", "B00006ADD5", "B0013FSL3E", "B00079Z9VO", "B00F6SHECS", "B0008JIJ2E", "B00CTNYLQA", "B00005JN4W"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00HVBB140", "B005F96UJ6", "B0000VCZKM", "B00I6JOD2S"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 206236}, "asin": "0792833171", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GYW80GAJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Wizard of Oz"}

The story is familiar, but it has been handled with such vitality and emotional honesty that you can't help but leap and cheer for Rocky Balboa, the chump turned champ (despite his valiant defeat in the ring) who stuns the boxing world with the support of his timid girlfriend, Adrian (Talia Shire), and grizzled trainer, Gus (Burgess Meredith).

{"description": "Truly ridiculous but somehow moving, this right-wing paranoid fantasy by John Milius (The Wind and the Lion) from 1984 concerns a Soviet takeover of the United States and a band of ragtag adolescents who metamorphose into freedom fighters. One can laugh at the notion of Nicaraguans, Cubans, and Russians having worked out a master plan to invade America, but Milius's account of how such a grim day affects a small Western town really does get under one's skin. The cast--most of whom were not yet stars (Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey had probably never heard of a script calledDirty Dancingat the time)--are quite persuasive as nice kids who come to recognize the tragedy of their lost innocence through fierce, uncompromising struggle. Powers Boothe is very good as a pilot who briefly comes to their aid, and Harry Dean Stanton is stirring as a solid working man and father who represents the virtues his sons are fighting for.

{"description": "Dustin Hoffman plays a lowlife who happens upon a plane crash and rescues the passengers, but doesn't really care about the value of his deed or the attendant publicity when the media starts searching for the hero. Another fellow (Andy Garcia) steps into the gap and claims credit, and as his life changes for the better he takes on a messianic glow. Geena Davis is the cynical television reporter who pushes the latter's fame in order to keep her story alive, and this film, directed by Stephen Frears (Prick Up Your Ears), takes a few familiar jabs at a manipulative and voyeuristic press. This is essentially an unofficial remake ofMeet John Doe, though it is less dramatic and forceful in the end than Frank Capra's classic. Chevy Chase has an oddly anachronistic part as Davis's editor (maybe he thought he really was inMeet John Doe), but the film belongs to Hoffman, who makes his character a slightly cleaned-up version of the actor's own Ratso Rizzo inMidnight Cowboy.--Tom Keogh", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 443525}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.7, "brand": "Hero", "asin": "0800121260", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51E50H7302L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Hero [VHS]"}
{"description": "Just what the world needs, another riff on that post-Psychohorror clich&eacute;: the slasher movie. In this version, which considerably dumbs down the Lois Duncan book, the bad guy chases naughty teenagers with a hook, all the while dressed as a dark version of the Gorton's fisherman. They seem to have killed someone in a car accident while out partying, and a price must be paid. Nothing new is added to the genre, though it would be unfair not to note that this does have some scary moments. That is about all it has, because as much as this wanted to be anotherScream, it hasn't the heart or the script. It does, however, have the requisite cast of small-screen stars (includingParty of Five's Jennifer Love Hewitt and Buffy herself, Sarah Michelle Gellar) to have snagged box-office success, spawning a sequel.--Rochelle O'Gorman", "related": {"also_bought": ["0767826728", "0792151712"], "bought_together": ["0767826728"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 332658}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.8, "brand": "", "asin": "0800184319", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/7107W97AXAL._SY300_.gif", "title": "I Know What You Did Last Summer [VHS]"}

{"description": "Overview\nFormer vice president Al Gore shares his concerns on the pressing issue of global warming in this documentary. A long-time environmental activist, Gore first became aware of evidence on global warming in the 1970s, and since leaving public office he has become a passionate advocate for large- and small-scale changes in our laws and lifestyles that could help alleviate this crisis. An Inconvenient Truth records a multi-media presentation hosted by Gore in which he discusses the scientific facts behind global warming, explains how it has already begun to affect our environment, talks about the disastrous consequences if the world's governments and citizens do not act, and shares what each individual can do to help protect the Earth for this and future generations. An Inconvenient Truth was directed by Davis Guggenheim, a veteran documentary filmmaker who also has an extensive background in episodic television.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JPXA", "B0013D8LHM", "B0027BOL4G", "0670062723", "B004IN75D0", "B0042EJD8A", "B00018U8YE", "B000YKI4MM", "B00147F8WS", "B0012Q3T72", "B0002OXVBO", "B000UNYJXQ", "B003M987AG", "1594865671", "B000I5Y8FU", "B001C17EVE", "B00005JMXX", "B001MWGZ6S", "B002PLMJ74", "B00366E1AK", "B001EP8EOY", "B000BTH4K4", "B000RPCJSE", "B002RB56W2", "B001EUSYHQ", "B0019KAQB8", "B004SO26RE", "B000BI5KV0", "B005OCJJ9M", "B002RX8G5E", "B005YFGIZM", "B000PY52IG", "B0041KKYBA", "B00AZMFNX2", "B001KWB0L0", "B003FNQ0I0", "B0069UP2PI", "0812982894", "B003Q6D28W", "0674058178", "B000BJS4FS", "B003Q6D28C", "1405187360", "B005YFGIZ2", "B0019A35G6", "B000OUCEZU", "B005ZMBDJK", "1594867348", "B00FGVS0DM", "B000MQ4WX8", "B005TZFZK6", "0312428928", "B0053ZHZI2", "B0055V6EX6", "B008NNY98U", "0767805712", "B00APG8QQO", "1586481983", "B002KLALEC", "B00DPUB5LK", "B003GSLVX8", "B00AEFXPSK", "B001E0KSAM", "B008LW2520", "B0009GX1EM", "B000WLUXZE", "B003CAKXAC", "B000CPHAAG", "B00IWULQQ2", "1931930007", "B00EL6AAEU", "B00013F2S6", "B005LAIH4A", "B000B0WO4O", "B006ZAPSJW", "B000EOTEM2", "0521732557", "B0007DBJM8", "B0018PH3NI", "B00CMDPTA4", "B004JR3OKI", "B00744WZ8U", "B0025XUTKQ", "B001M0N8UQ", "B0040QYRS6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005JPXA", "B0027BOL4G", "0670062723", "B004SO26RE"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 50499}, "asin": "1415724784", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51p%2Btk39UpL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "An Inconvenient Truth"}

And the first thing to learn is never upstage Mercury Theatre's genius director, 22-year-old Orson Welles.Zac Efron wins hearts and applause as Richard, the Me of this celebratory curtain call for when dreams -- and the theater -- were big. Christian McKay offers an uncanny Welles, the imposing, impetuous center of Richard's exciting new universe. Claire Danes is the enterprising stage assistant drawn into both men's lives. And Richard Linklater (Before Sunset,The School of Rock) directs with the vibrant spirit of those for whom all the world is a stage.Bravo!", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000OIOPKY", "B003L20IHE", "B009R8Q8Y8", "B00C7BZX34", "B001OQCUYI", "B002LFPBHY", "B00IVLRA62", "B009B8YZ76", "B00EO10IEE", "B003L20IHO", "B00KE3B9US", "B00866JL96", "B001NE80P4", "B004LWZW9C", "B002D0L0R2", "B000MEYKAU", "0783116764", "B000VAPZM2", "0143117122", "B00003CWNU", "B009R8Q924", "B001OQCUYS", "B00005YUPJ", "B000F2BNW2", "B00KGLS050", "B00C7BZXWK", "B001OQCUZM", "B00IKM5MIA", "B004UVYQVY", "6305364559", "B00005JKGX", "B00IVLRA9E", "B00KAJ2LKS", "B009W21N7G", "B00JVQ7QTM", "B00K8HAKAK", "B00005YU1O", "B00IA7MFEO", "B00I4CWIVU", "B00JG88WDY", "B00007JXWX", "B00IJZMZW4", "B0013D8LCC", "B00HOGBXS6", "B00866JLEG", "B00AEFXGWK", "B000PMFRVU", "B0071HPP3M", "B0034G4P30", "B004LWZW9M", "B00EO10OF2", "B000EDWKX8", "B00GNZM0D6", "B00008L3TK", "B00G3DA5XA", "B00H9HZITU", "B00IARA8KM", "B0000633SD", "B00FQY4KSI", "B000VKL6T8", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B00HQKREFG", "B002945DUW", "B004QL7JYO", "B00GMV8L1Q", "B008IG09FO", "B00EJGMF22", "B0077PBPTG", "B009L79YRI", "B000092T3P", "B004KPLVXQ", "B000F6II1M", "B00DPUB5GA", "B00077BOFG", "1931561494", "B00891ZD6I", "B000QCTGIE", "B00DNQM7N6", "B00DHN8GL2", "B0036TGT5M", "B00GWWV1XU", "B000M341SC", "B001NZ3E40", "B00DJYJQ36", "B0088P5Z4U", "B00J11U4T6", "B002ZG97QK", "B00555ZTRY", "B0059XTUB8", "0780618564", "B00000JNBX", "B000F5WR4W", "B000NNUX10", "B0009I8QHC", "B00BNWWVFG", "B00AEBB89W", "B00D3LA5WG", "B00ADRYCWC", "B005LAIGXW"], "bought_together": ["B000OIOPKY", "B003L20IHE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003L20IHE", "B001OQCUYI", "B00866JL96", "B00C7BZX34"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 71335}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.49, "brand": "", "asin": "1419897543", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51SR0Xf0KqL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Me &amp; Orson Welles"}

{"description": "Set during the Chinese takeover of Hong Kong in 1997, this fascinating film uses that urgent and grandly ceremonial political backdrop for an intimate study of personal transition. Jeremy Irons plays a seasoned journalist who discovers he is terminally ill, causing him to be torn between his obsessive love for a former prostitute (Chinese film star Li Gong) and a streetwise hustler (Maggie Cheung) whom he has chosen as the subject of a video documentary. Through his involvement in the lives of these two very different women, director Wayne Wang (The Joy Luck Club) creates a cinematic \"love-hate letter\" to his native Hong Kong, where each character is allegorical and suffers an identity crisis much like Hong Kong itself. The film's love story is somewhat aimless and ultimately unimportant, butChinese Box(even the title suggests a place that holds secrets within its borders) remains a fascinating film in the semi-documentary tradition, capturing the psychology of its time and place with compelling immediacy.

This Captain Ahab is a hard, driven man--you can see it in his burning eyes--and there's no question he has the resolve and the mad devotion to complete his quest at all costs: kill the white whale that took his leg. Franc Roddam's mini-series adaptation of Herman Melville's classic novel (filmed previously by John Huston in 1956) manages its budget wisely: a judicious use of digital effects creates a terrifying vision of the great white whale, and Roddam's eye captures a near-epic quality. Henry Thomas's earnest performance as the young seaman Ishmael can't compete with Stewart's intensity, and Gregory Peck's cameo as Father Mapple is a hollow echo of his passionate Ahab from Huston'smasterpiece. But the rest of the cast excels, and Roddam's haunting imagery and horrific climax make this a compelling dramatic adventure.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B005BYBZO0", "6304196911"], "bought_together": ["B005BYBZO0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 326344}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 9.95, "brand": "", "asin": "157492530X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51X031NNZFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Moby Dick [VHS]"}

{"description": "When Columbia Pictures sought to pair Mae West and W.C. Fields in a film, neither was thrilled, but since both stars' careers were on the skids, they agreed to the project. They fought about everything: script, billing, casting, philosophy, work habits, style. Onscreen, Fields is always the butt of his own jokes. West never is. He's all broad slapstick, she, all sly innuendo. In the film West hangs onto her precious image--that inimitable combo of sexiness and wit--as Fields systematically subverts it. It's the clash of the screen-legend titans.In the Wild West town of Greasewood, West, as Flower Belle Lee (her usual seductive saloon singer), is kidnapped by the Masked Bandit (Joseph Calleia, in a role Bogart turned down). After refusing to turn him in, she's run out of town and can only return when she's \"married and respectable.\" She meets flimflam man Cuthbert J. Twillie (Fields) on a train. He's instantly smitten: \"My heart is a bargain today, will you take me?\" \"I'll take you, and how,\" she agrees, spying his satchel of cash. Many plot twists later, Twillie's on the gallows. Hangman: \"Have you any last requests?\" Twillie: \"I'd like to see Paris before I die. Philadelphia will do.\" In her ideal happy ending, West's Flower Belle finds true love--with two men--the Masked Bandit and the town muckraker, Wayne Carter (Dick Foran).The film's funniest scenes involve Field's futile attempts to get West into a compromising position: \"I have some very definite pear-shaped ideas I'd like to discuss with thee.\" Suffice it to say that Fields ends up in bed with a goat.--Laura Mirsky", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302798434", "078322835X", "630018305X", "6300186016"], "bought_together": ["6302798434"], "also_viewed": ["6302798434"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 325922}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.87, "brand": "", "asin": "6300181294", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5196A24E18L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "My Little Chickadee [VHS]"}

{"description": "The best-sellingnovelby Michael Crichton was faithfully adapted for this taut 1971 thriller, about a team of scientists racing against time to destroy a deadly alien virus that threatens to wipe out life on Earth. As usual with any Crichton-based movie, the emphasis is on an exciting clash between nature and science, beginning when virologists discover the outer-space virus in a tiny town full of corpses. Projecting total contamination, the scientists isolate the deadly strain in a massive, high-tech underground lab facility, which is rigged for nuclear destruction if the virus is not successfully controlled. The movie spends a great deal of time covering the scientific procedures of the high-pressure investigation, and the rising tensions between scientists who have been forced to work in claustrophobic conditions. It's all very fascinating if you're interested in scientific method and technological advances, although the film is obviously dated in many of its details. It's more effective as a thriller in which tension is derived not only from the deadly threat of the virus, but from the escalating fear and anxiety among the small group of people who've been assigned to save the human race. The basic premise is still captivating; it's easy to see how this became the foundation of Crichton's science-thriller empire.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302909023", "6300183580", "6301562178", "6303212263", "6300213838", "6301977815", "0792835077", "6302098424", "630442972X", "6300271781", "6301971426", "6301968948", "6301744160", "6300183513", "6300181340", "6303257828", "6302182522", "0792845684"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 63562}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 25.0, "brand": "", "asin": "6300181537", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51M29A10DWL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Andromeda Strain [VHS]"}

Frank Langella had just taken Broadway by storm in a revival of the play based on Bram Stoker's classic vampire novel. He was tall, elegant, and almost painfully romantic--all qualities that failed to translate to this garish, tarted-up film version. The story remains the same, if told in greater length than in Bela Lugosi's version. The film even offered Laurence Olivier as vampire-hunter Van Helsing (in one of several roles he played during the period that required a middle-European accent) and a young Kate Nelligan as the woman whose love (and blood) Dracula most wants.

{"description": "Even a man who is pure in heart,And says his prayers by night,May become a wolf when the wolfbane bloomsAnd the autumn moon is bright.If you haven't heard this piece of horror-movie doggerel before, you'll never forget it after seeingThe Wolf Manfor two reasons: it's a spooky piece of rhyme and nearly everybody in the picture recites it at one time or another. Set in a fog-bound studio-built Wales,The Wolf Mantells the doom-laden tale of Lawrence Talbot (Lon Chaney Jr.), who returns to the estate of his wealthy father (Claude Rains). (Yes, Chaney's American, but the movie explains this, awkwardly.) Bitten by a werewolf, Talbot suffers the classic fate of the victims of lycanthropy: at the full moon, he turns into a werewolf, a transformation ingeniously devised by makeup maestro Jack Pierce. Pierce was the man who turned Boris Karloff into the Frankenstein monster, and his werewolf makeup became equally famous, with its canine snout and bushy hairdo--and, of course, seriously sharp dental work.The Wolf Manwas a smash hit, giving Universal Pictures a new monster for their already crowded stable, and Chaney found himself following in the footsteps (or paw prints) of his father, who had essayed a monster or two in the silent era. This is a classy horror outing, with strong atmosphere and a thoughtful script by Curt Siodmak--well, except for the stiff romantic bits between Chaney and Evelyn Ankers.

{"description": "This is the TV movie that put Steven Spielberg on the map, shortly before he madeThe Sugarland Express. Working from a script by Richard Matheson, the film stars Dennis Weaver as a mild-mannered traveling salesman who unintentionally angers the driver of a semi truck. Suddenly, the truck is not only riding his tail but trying to run him off the road. No matter what he does (pulling over, stopping at a diner, calling the cops), he can't get rid of it. Spielberg makes the wise decision of never showing the driver, even as he cranks the voltage on the film's suspense elements. As a result, the truck itself takes on an air of satanic menace--even a personality of sorts--as it seems to hunt its human prey. Spielberg made a lot out of a little, suggesting just how skilled a storyteller he would become.--Marshall Fine", "related": {"also_bought": ["0764006770", "B0013527K2", "630197705X", "0792835077", "630180550X", "6301976061", "0792846443", "B00AEFXX9Q", "6305123616", "6300214060", "B004IB04NK", "6300213838", "6303471552", "6302890721", "6303148352", "B0000068EE", "6301969413", "6304071876", "6302038308", "0790733897", "0790734079", "6302516919", "6300213900", "6300181340", "0783231482", "6300181286", "0783235607", "6304005512"], "bought_together": ["B0013527K2"], "also_viewed": ["B0013527K2"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 250761}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 19.88, "brand": "", "asin": "6300181987", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51FN746KT0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Duel [VHS]"}
{"description": "At three brief hours,La Dolce Vita, a piece of cynical, engrossing social commentary, stands as Federico Fellini's timeless masterpiece. Arich, detailed panorama of Rome's modern decadence and sophisticated immorality, the film is episodic in structure but held tightly in focus by the wandering protagonist through whom we witness the sordid action. Marcello Rubini (extraordinarily played by Marcello Mastroianni) is a tabloid reporter trapped in a shallow high-society existence. A man of paradoxical emotional juxtapositions (cool but tortured, sexy but impotent), he dreams about writing something important but remains seduced by the money and prestige that accompany his shallow position. He romanticizes finding true love but acts unfazed upon finding that his girlfriend has taken an overdose of sleeping pills. Instead, he engages in an m&eacute;nage &agrave; trois, then frolics in a fountain with a giggling American starlet (bombshell Anita Ekberg), and in the film's unforgettably inspired finale, attends a wild orgy that ends, symbolically, with its participants finding a rotting sea animal while wandering the beach at dawn. Fellini saw his film as life affirming (thus its title,The Sweet Life), but it's impossible to take him seriously. While Mastroianni drifts from one worldly pleasure to another, be it sex, drink, glamorous parties, or rich foods, they are presented, through his detached eyes, are merely momentary distractions. His existence, an endless series of wild evenings and lonely mornings, is ultimately soulless and facile. Because he lacks the courage to change, Mastroianni is left with no alternative but to wearily accept and enjoy this \"sweet\" life.--Dave McCoy", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000001A5E", "6305372594", "6301025083", "6302641888", "B000I0RNV6", "6303107346", "6302875064", "6303855490", "6303977898", "630347327X", "0792841484", "B00000J2L7"], "also_viewed": ["B002U6DVQM", "B00HRJVHEK", "B003Z7S9BM", "6305081034", "B00HET136A", "B00JAQJMJ0"]}, "price": 24.44, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 165421}, "asin": "6300208591", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5190KCKV57L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "La Dolce Vita [VHS]"}
{"description": "As bad asFriday the 13th, Part 2is, it's a work of art in comparison to the rest of theFriday the 13thflicks that came afterward. This installment officially introduced us to Jason Voorhees as the killer (if you remember Drew Barrymore's fatal phone quiz inScream, you know that the killer in the firstFriday the 13thwas actually Jason's mother), and made the slicing and dicing even more generic. Survivor Alice is dispatched within the first 10 minutes, and we're left with plucky Ginny (Amy Steel, doing a fairly decent Jamie Lee Curtis impression) to do battle with the monstrous Jason. Ginny's part of a another group of horny teenagers (less intelligent as well as less attractive than their predecessors) who try to resurrect Camp Crystal Lake five years after the initial murders--a pretty mean feat, considering this movie was made only a year after the first one. Being a smarty-pants child-psychology major, Ginny tries to outwit the dim Jason, and at one point dons the bloody and moldy sweater of Jason's late mother (which is more disgusting than any of the killings beforehand) in an attempt to confuse the masked killer. Jason may not be the brightest bulb on the tree, but the only one who's going to pull the wool--or in this case, the burlap--over his eyes is Jason himself, who wears a sack with one eyehole throughout the movie to hide his deformed features (he finally found his way to a sporting-goods store and his trademark hockey mask appears in the third installment of the series).

{"description": "Widely considered the best movie in the \"classicTrek\" series of feature films,Star Trek IVreturns to one of the favorite themes of the original TV series--time travel--to bring Kirk, Spock, McCoy, Scotty, Sulu, Uhura, and Chekov from the 23rd century to present-day San Francisco. In their own time, the Starfleet heroes encounter an alien probe emitting a mysterious message--a message delivered in the song of the now-extinct Earth species of humpback whales. Failure to respond to the probe will result in Earth's destruction, so Kirk and company time-travel to 20th-century Earth--in their captured Klingon starship--to transport a humpback whale to the future in an effort to peacefully communicate with the alien probe. The plot sounds somewhat absurd in description, but as executed by returning director Leonard Nimoy, this turned out to be a crowd-pleasing adventure, filled with humor and lively interaction among the favorite Star Trek characters. Catherine Hicks (from TV's7th Heaven) plays the 20th-century whale expert who is finally convinced of Kirk's and Spock's benevolent intentions. With ample comedy taken from the clash of future heroes with 20th-century urban realities,Star Trek IVwas a box-office smash, satisfying mainstream audiences and hardcoreTrekfans alike.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303202004", "6300213803", "6301543408", "6300216802", "6300214400", "6304415346", "B00008OSD3", "6303909949", "6305587159"], "bought_together": ["6303202004", "6300213803"], "also_viewed": ["6300214400", "6300213803", "6301543408", "6303202004", "6300216802", "6304415346", "0800103106", "B00004U8P4", "6300214540", "630273486X", "630339406X", "6302877881", "B00BAXTYIA", "B00000ILBK", "6304539274", "B00DB97LCM", "B001TH16DI"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 116860}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 0.98, "brand": "", "asin": "630021463X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51G68FMQNQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Star Trek IV - The Voyage Home [VHS]"}

{"description": "Back when the  firstStar Trekfeature was released in December 1979, theTrekfranchise was still relatively modest, consisting of the original TV series, an animated cartoon series from 1973-74, and a burgeoning fan network around the world. Series creator Gene Roddenberry had conceived a second TV series, but after the success ofStar Warsthe project was upgraded into this lavish feature film, which reunited the original series cast aboard a beautifully redesigned starship U.S.S.Enterprise. Under the direction of Robert Wise (best known forWest Side Story), the film proved to be a mixed blessing forTrekfans, who heatedly debated its merits; but it was, of course, a phenomenal hit. Capt. Kirk (William Shatner) leads his crew into the vast structures surrounding V'Ger, an all-powerful being that is cutting a destructive course through Starfleet space. With his new First Officer (Stephen Collins), the bald and beautiful Lieutenant Ilia (played by the late Persis Khambatta) and his returning veteran crew, Kirk must decipher the secret of V'Ger's true purpose and restore the safety of the galaxy. The story is rather overblown and derivative of plots from the original series, and avid Trekkies greeted the film's bland costumes with derisive laughter. But as a feast for the eyes, this is an adventure worthy of big-screen trekkin'. Douglas Trumbull's visual effects are astonishing, and Jerry Goldmith's score is regarded as one of the prolific composer's very best (with its main theme later used forStar Trek: The Next Generation). And, fortunately forStar Trekfans, the expanded 143-minute version (originally shown for the film's network TV premiere) is generally considered an improvement over the original theatrical release.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300214400", "6300213803", "6301543408", "6303202004", "630021463X", "6303909949", "B0000AUHOH", "B00008OSD3", "6301792734", "6305587159", "6300182304", "B0000A36J1", "B000065U6Q", "6304415346", "6305365121", "630336568X", "0671830880", "6300214060", "6304935811", "6302380588", "6303651488"], "bought_together": ["6300213803", "6300214400"], "also_viewed": ["6300213803", "6301543408", "B00DB97LRC", "6300214400", "630021463X", "B00BAXTYIA", "B00005JLRT", "6303202004", "B00DB97LCM", "B00000ILBK", "B002I9Z8DK", "B0000AUHOH", "B002I9Z8B2", "6304415346", "6304539258", "B000USUA8Y", "B002I9Z8CG", "B0095XPZBC", "B002I9Z8GW", "B001TH16DI", "B0083TUEHY", "B00HETWFVC", "630273486X", "B000HEWEJ4", "6303909949", "6300213668"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 278050}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.79, "brand": "", "asin": "6300216802", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4164CYFHC6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Star Trek - The Motion Picture [VHS]"}
{"description": "In the tradition of such obsessively driven directors as Erich von Stroheim and Werner Herzog, Francis Ford Coppola approached the production ofApocalypse Nowas if it were his own epic mission into the heart of darkness. On location in the storm-ravaged Philippines, he quite literally went mad as the project threatened to devour him in a vortex of creative despair, but from this insanity came one of the greatest films ever made. It began as a John Milius screenplay, transposing Joseph Conrad's classic story \"Heart of Darkness\" into the horrors of the Vietnam War, following a battle-weary Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) on a secret upriver mission to find and execute the renegade Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), who has reverted to a state of murderous and mystical insanity. The journey is fraught with danger involving wartime action on epic and intimate scales. One measure of the film's awesome visceral impact is the number of sequences, images, and lines of dialogue that have literally burned themselves into our cinematic consciousness, from the Wagnerian strike of helicopter gunships on a Vietnamese village to the brutal murder of stowaways on a peasant sampan and the unflinching fearlessness of the surfing warrior Lieutenant Colonel Kilgore (Robert Duvall), who speaks lovingly of \"the smell of napalm in the morning.\" Like Herzog'sAguirre: The Wrath of God, this film is the product of genius cast into a pit of hell and emerging, phoenix-like, in triumph. Coppola's obsession (effectively detailed in the riveting documentaryHearts of Darkness, directed by Coppola's wife, Eleanor) informs every scene and every frame, and the result is a film for the ages.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301115430", "630018627X", "0790701251", "6300183211", "6303686796", "6305363668", "079284646X", "6304935811", "0784011923", "6303953425", "0792836510", "6302822688", "B000003KHS", "630021639X", "6304119046", "B00003CXE6", "6302610702", "0792158261", "B000K7VHQE", "6303036570", "6303020089", "6303651488", "0800125762", "B004LWZW9W", "B00000JGEI", "0790705141", "6302360978", "6302415853", "0783107986", "B00005ATQA", "630336568X", "0790731975", "6305095566", "6300216500", "6301662954", "6302921058", "6300246965", "6300182878", "0800100832", "B00005JKEC", "6304286961", "B000062XM6", "0784011575", "630197154X", "B00004TYS8", "B00004WIDB", "6304414099", "0800116917", "6302517036", "0800199421", "6304259131", "0783202253", "6303109950", "6303313345", "B00006C7G9", "0792837312", "6302482712", "6300213986", "6303421563", "6304039549", "B000065U6Q", "B0000A36J1", "6300182770", "B00004CNR5", "6304025831", "6303422020", "0790748169", "0800132009"], "bought_together": ["6301115430", "0790701251"], "also_viewed": ["6303953425", "6305363668", "6305750750", "B00000J2KZ", "6303506291", "6303314015"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 172447}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.75, "brand": "", "asin": "6300214826", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41EFVS37MRL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Apocalypse Now [VHS]"}

{"description": "The prestigious filmmaking trio of producer Ismail Merchant, director James Ivory, and screenwriter Ruth Prawer Jhabvala had made other critically acclaimed films beforeA Room with a Viewwas released in 1985, but it was this popular film that made them art-house superstars. Splendidly adapted from the novel by E.M. Forster, it's a comedy of the heart, a passionate romance and a study of repression within the British class system of manners and mores. It's that system of rigid behavior that prevents young Lucy Honeychurch (Helena Bonham Carter) from accepting the loving advances of a free-spirited suitor (Julian Sands), who fears that she will follow through with her engagement to a priggish intellectual (Daniel Day-Lewis) whose capacity for passion is virtually nonexistent. During and after a trip to Italy with her protective companion (Maggie Smith), Lucy gradually gets in touch with her true emotions. The fun of watchingA Room with a Viewcomes from seeing how Lucy's thoughts and feelings finally arrive at the same romantic conclusion. Through an abundance of humor both subtle and overt, this crowd-pleasing \"art movie\" rose to an unexpected level of popular appeal. The Merchant-Ivory team received eight Academy Award nominations for their efforts, and won the Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay, Art Direction, and Costume Design.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000048PO", "B00003CXC9", "6302728657", "6303052223", "6301965817"], "bought_together": ["B0000048PO", "B00003CXC9"], "also_viewed": ["B004SIP7D0", "B0015LPRSI"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 195581}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 23.98, "brand": "", "asin": "6300250512", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/417J0G7GBCL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "A Room With a View [VHS]"}

That's right, you heard it correctly:Star Trek Vis about a crazy Vulcan's search for God. By the time Kirk, Spock, and their Federation cohorts are taken to the Great Barrier of the galaxy, this journey to \"the final future\" has gone from an embarrassing prologue to an absurd conclusion, with a lot of creaky plotting in between.

{"description": "Rainer Werner Fassbinder paid tribute to his mentor, Douglas Sirk, with this loose adaptation ofAll That Heaven Allows, the classic American soaper of a widow falling for younger man to the disapproval of family and friends. Fassbinder combines the Sirk melodrama with the story told in his ownThe American Soldier. An aging, lonely charwoman (sweet old Brigitte Mira) befriends a Moroccan guest worker (El Hedi ben Salem) at least 20 years her junior. Finding comfort and happiness in one another's company, they suddenly marry. Her kids are aghast, his friends appalled, and the neighborhood turns its back, so the two pull together for support. Their relationship ironically begins to unravel when the pressure of community prejudice eases and they must confront the gulf between them. Combining melodrama with social commentary, Fassbinder offers a sharp, incisive portrait of prejudice in modern Germany grounded in contemporary social conditions. Mira delivers a tender, vulnerable performance and Fassbinder molds Salem's stiffness into a distinctive character trait of a man ill at ease in German society. It's an assured and beautiful film, full of gliding camerawork and evocative images, and invested with intimacy and gentleness. Even Fassbinder's characteristically grim conclusion defies tragedy for a glimmer of hope, a welcome and affecting rarity in his career.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B000FVGNSM"]}, "price": 33.96, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 634342}, "asin": "6301599918", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/213P456XKBL.jpg", "title": "Ali: Fear Eats the Soul [VHS]"}

{"description": "It's set during the Korean War, in a mobile army surgical hospital. But no one seeingM*A*S*Hin 1970 confused the film for anything but a caustic comment on the Vietnam War; this is one of the counterculture movies that exploded into the mainstream at the end of the '60s. Director Robert Altman had labored for years in television and sporadic feature work when this smash-hit comedy made his name (and allowed him to create an astonishing string of offbeat pictures, culminating in the masterpieceNashville). Altman's style of cruel humor, overlapping dialogue, and densely textured visuals brought the material to life in an all-new kind of war movie (or, more precisely, antiwar movie). Audiences had never seen anything like it: vaudeville routines played against spurting blood, fueled with open ridicule of authority. The cast is led by Elliott Gould and Donald Sutherland, as the outrageous surgeons Hawkeye Pierce and Trapper John McIntyre, with Robert Duvall as the uptight Major Burns and Sally Kellerman in an Oscar-nominated role as nurse \"Hot Lips\" Houlihan. The film's huge success spawned the long-running TV series, a considerably softer take on the material; of the film's cast, only Gary Burghoff repeated his role on the small screen, as the slightly clairvoyant Radar O'Reilly.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B003ASLJS6", "B003ASLJRC", "B000003KHS", "6300215830", "6305576173"], "also_viewed": ["B001DMVZJ4", "B000HT3P5Q", "B001DMVZNK", "B000OT6V1E", "0792107128", "B001DMVZJO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 404206}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 0.44, "brand": "20th Century Fox", "asin": "6301777387", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51EFEZNDA0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "M*A*S*H [VHS]"}

{"description": "A King in New York, Charlie Chaplin's penultimate film--featuring his final starring performance--was made in 1957 but wasn't officially released in America until the '70s, when it, surprisingly enough, won an Oscar for Chaplin's score. What took so long? Thanks to his politics and unorthodox personal life, Chaplin was pretty roundly hated by the late '50s, but had the movie been better, someone might've brought it stateside sooner. Chaplin plays King Shahdov of Estrovia, on the lam when revolution grips his homeland. In New York, despite the occasional indignity, he's treated as royalty until he takes a stand against the commie-hunters, a plotline that hit way too close to home at the time (Chaplin, remember, was ahead of everyone in attacking Hitler when he madeThe Great Dictator). There's one inspired bit, as Shahdov orders dinner over the din of a supper club, but overall, the satire is strident, and Chaplin's takes on such things as technology and pop music make him look decidedly like an old fogy.--David Kronke", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B000UO4F7U"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 313809}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.98, "brand": "", "asin": "6301798457", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/519YWT73R7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "A King in New York [VHS]"}

{"description": "Australian model George Lazenby took up the mantle of the world's most suave secret agent when Sean Connery retired as James Bond--prematurely, it turned out. Connery returned inDiamonds Are Foreverbefore leaving the role to Roger Moore and Lazenby's subsequent career fizzled, yet this one-hit wonder is responsible for one of the best Bond films of all time.InOn Her Majesty's Secret Service, 007 leaves the Service to privately  pursue his SPECTRE nemesis Blofeld (played this time by Telly Savalas), whose latest master plan involves a threat to the world's crops by agricultural sterilization. Bond teams up with suave international crime lord Draco (Gabriele Ferzetti) and falls in love with--and marries--his elegant daughter, Tracy (Diana Rigg). Bond goes monogamous? Not at first; after all he has Blofeld's harem to seduce.

{"description": "Star Trek Vleft us nowhere to go but up, and with the return ofStar Trek IIdirector Nicholas Meyer,Star Trek VIrestored the movie series to its classic blend of space opera, intelligent plotting, and engaging interaction of stalwart heroes and menacing villains. Borrowing its subtitle (and several lines of dialogue) from Shakespeare, the movie finds Admiral Kirk (William Shatner) and his fellowEnterprisecrew members on a diplomatic mission to negotiate peace with the revered Klingon Chancellor Gorkon (David Warner). When the high-ranking Klingon and several officers are ruthlessly murdered, blame is placed on Kirk, whose subsequent investigation uncovers an assassination plot masterminded by the nefarious Klingon General Chang (Christopher Plummer) in an effort to disrupt a historic peace summit. As this political plot unfolds,Star Trek VItakes on a sharp-edged tone, with Kirk and Spock confronting their opposing views of diplomacy, and testing their bonds of loyalty when a Vulcan officer is revealed to be a traitor. With a dramatic depth befitting what was to be the final movie mission of the originalStar Trekcrew, this film took the veteran cast out in respectably high style. With the torch being passed to the crew ofStar Trek: The Next Generation, only Kirk, Scotty, and Chekov would return, however briefly, inStar Trek: Generations.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301543408", "630021463X", "6300213803", "6304415346", "6300216802", "6300214400", "6305587159", "6303909949", "B00008OSD3", "B000003K8T", "B000ECVAVW", "B000AA4FII", "6303944736", "B0001DI5W6", "6302424216", "6302510031", "B00005JLTM", "6304047843", "6302510023", "6302380294", "B0000068SI", "B0001VL30O", "B00000K2SC", "6301966988", "6305363668", "6302380596", "B00004TYS8", "0792839846", "B0002TT0NM", "B0000A36J1", "B000005QWI", "B00000JGEK", "630281622X"], "bought_together": ["6301543408", "6300213803"], "also_viewed": ["6301543408", "6300213803", "630021463X", "6300214400", "6300216802", "630273486X", "B00471JSRE", "6304415346", "B00BAXTYIA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 158198}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 0.99, "brand": "", "asin": "630242335X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51XTS50JFQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Star Trek VI - The Undiscovered Country [VHS]"}

More self-consciously suave and formal than predecessor Sean Connery, he immediately reestablished Bond as an uncomplicated and wooden fellow for the feel-good '70s.

If that's not depressing enough, there's even a good British director on board, Guy Hamilton (Force 10 from Navarone).

Rather than repeat the scenario of the Invisible Man going mad from the effects of his own invisibility serum, this engaging mystery begins when a murderer (Cedric Hardwicke) plots to frame his brother (Price), who then uses the invisibility serum to escape from jail and clear his name. Price is a fine replacement for Rains, since both men were blessed with a mellifluous voice that would become the focus of their performances. Once again, John P.

{"description": "You know how it goes. You hear about what a sensation someone like  Josephine Baker was in her prime (in her case, the 1920s and '30s), how she pushed boundaries in such delicate areas as race and sex, how she both  thrilled and scandalized Paris with her exotic dancing and personal  behavior. You have all these loose strands of legend and random fact, your  curiosity is running high, and then you hear that a feature film is being made about the very subject. You watch, and  then wonder: what was the big deal about Josephine Baker? The problem with  this 1991 TV movie is the same as with a number of HBO films from the 1980s and early '90s: it isn't particularly well written, the production looks rushed, and the entire point is obscured in a whirl of biographical  material that doesn't sufficiently develop into insightful, organic unity. WhatThe Josephine Baker Storydoes do, however, is provide a reference  point from which to begin an appreciation of Baker's life. A poor,  African American girl from St. Louis, Baker found fame and wealth in Europe as a dancer whose partially nude, unbridled performances invoked wit, sexual liberation, and passion--without, somehow, seeming vulgar or  obscene. As Baker, Lynn Whitfield gets into the uninhibited spirit of things,  free with her body and enthusiastic about re-creating many of her  character's performances (yes, the famed Banana Dance is a highlight). The  film superficially suggests that Baker was celebrated as an expressive  artist, a healthy force of nature rather than a lewd exhibitionist, but it  doesn't go far enough down that road to tell us why she matters. Somewhat  better is the script's contrasting emphasis on Baker's celebrity overseas  and her second-class status as a black woman in America. In the end, the  film's real accomplishment is underscoring how racism truly determines the  course of an individual's life, and the way Baker understood that both from the vantage point of a refugee and a victim.--Tom Keogh", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 438979}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 5.49, "brand": "", "asin": "6302555337", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/517RZE0SosL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Josephine Baker Story [VHS]"}

The film does a marvelous job of portraying the challenges of cloistered life without being either off-putting or overly romantic. And Hepburn, sometimes with only her eyes, communicates all the drive, faith, and conflict of a young woman so torn.--Anne Hurley", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300251152", "6302878527", "6300215741"], "bought_together": ["6300251152"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 287036}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.57, "brand": "", "asin": "6302636779", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51V843DC4YL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Nun's Story [VHS]"}

{"description": "This love story made in 1955 and set against the backdrop of war is a many-splendored thing: it features a drop-dead gorgeous Eurasian doctor seeking meaning in her life (Jennifer Jones), a dashing but married American war correspondent who's macho yet not afraid to declare his love (William Holden), and a couple of murky subplots to give their relationship its oh-what's-going-to-happen-next edge (her Chinese heritage, his wife, the outbreak of the Korean War). One scene builds beautifully upon the next, accompanied by dialogue that often sounds like poetry: \"I will make no mistakes in the name of loneliness,\" the doctor says near the beginning of their relationship. The movie also makes few mistakes as it combines thoughtful words with Oscar-winning costumes to tell its tale.

{"description": "One of the biggest teases in film history, this film's sensational plot finds a young wife (Demi Moore) solicited for sex by a wealthy bachelor (Robert Redford), for which the latter offers to pay a cool million bucks to her and her underachieving husband (Woody Harrelson). The two accept Redford's deal, and their marriage is ruined. The twist in the film, though, is that the sin doesn't lie with the rich guy, but rather with this unfocused, immature, equivocating couple who would do such a thing, naively believing it would get their lives on track. Director Adrian Lyne, who caused an even greater stir by filmingLolita(the one starring Jeremy Irons), thus pulls a kind of thinking person's bait and switch, promising something tawdry and then turning the story around so its focus is on a rite of passage for the estranged spouses.

{"description": "This huge 1993 hit for Robin Williams and director Chris Columbus (Home Alone), based on a novel calledAlias Madame Doubtfireby Anne Fine, stars Williams as a loving but flaky father estranged from his frustrated wife (Sally Field). Devastated by a court order limiting his time with the children, Williams's character disguises himself as a warm, old British nanny who becomes the kids' best friend. As with Dustin Hoffman's performance inTootsie, Williams's drag act--buried under layers of latex and padding--is the show, and everything and everyone else on screen serves his sometimes frantic role. Since that's the case, it's fortunate that Williams is Williams, and his performance is terribly funny at times and exceptionally believable in those scenes where his character misses his children. Playing Williams's brother, a professional makeup artist, Harvey Fierstein has a good support role in a bright sequence where he tries a number of feminine looks on Williams before settling on Mrs. Doubtfire's visage.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302091632", "6302800420", "6303257844", "6302765536", "630339406X", "B00329TVQA", "6302581907", "6303140157", "6300247236", "6304416415", "B00004XPQQ", "B000005PFL", "0800196767", "B000008IPR", "0783230893", "B000007OY0", "6304500718", "6302089654", "6303409997", "6300213668", "630273973X", "6304311834", "6302426200"], "bought_together": ["6302800420"], "also_viewed": ["0792151712", "6302961572", "6303314015", "6304233639", "0788806270", "0788812408", "B00005JKDQ", "6304290888", "6303983812", "0788812807", "6302765536", "155890641X", "6305229449", "0788805843", "0788811002", "B00003CXXI", "B00003CXQX", "6301966988", "6304089767", "0790727382", "6303402348", "6304500831", "B0000DCGT1", "6305326940", "5554458521", "6302091632", "6304401132", "B00007J88X"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 106101}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.95, "brand": "20th Century Fox", "asin": "6303049079", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51lvoybRsfL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Mrs Doubtfire [VHS]"}

It has its share of bad guys (the Fratelli brothers and their villainous mother), reluctant-hero good guys (the Walsh bothers and their gang of friends), and lots of corny one-liners.

Luckily, the beloved gang stumbles on a treasure map. In the hopes of finding the treasure to buy back their houses, the Goonies embark on their quest through underground passages, aboard pirate ships, and behind waterfalls. This swashbuckling and rollicking ride was also a great breeding ground for a couple of child actors who went on to enjoy numerous successes in adulthood: Sean Astin (Rudy,Encino Man) and Martha Plimpton (Pecker,200 Cigarettes).--Samantha Allen Storey", "related": {"also_bought": ["0790700506", "6303506291", "6303212395", "6300263681", "0790742322", "0767825411", "6301871952", "B00005B238", "6301792734", "B00005PJ8I", "6303257844", "630157401X", "B00000JGEK", "6304143184", "6300214060", "6302945127", "6301179552", "B00004TWZK", "B00000JGEI", "6304718551", "0783216084", "B00000JPH5", "630339406X", "6301163796", "6302968143", "B00006AL1C", "6304466498", "0788802194", "0783229011", "6304978286", "6302798450", "B00016JF2W", "B002NZK5SW", "6302642256", "6300248089", "0800125762", "0790724960", "6304509154", "6301666569", "6302705517", "6301569385", "6301578805", "6300989003", "B00008DDXB", "6302815673", "B00000JPH4", "630596260X", "6302961661", "B000AQE9WY", "6303486754", "6301744136", "6305576173", "0800196767", "6300183467", "0800125789", "B0002TT0NM", "B0000048S1", "0790732580", "6303212263", "0784011923", "6300184269", "6300271285", "6304169558", "B00005LIRF", "6300214710", "B00004U8P4", "6300182878", "B0007A2GSM", "630309239X", "6302877881", "6304340648", "B00008X5J8", "0767821912", "6303140157", "6303442447", "6303454089", "6302409365", "B00003CXI0", "B000035Z46", "B00005JLR1", "6303929583"], "bought_together": ["0790700506", "0790742322"], "also_viewed": ["0790742322", "6303506291", "0767825411", "155890641X", "6303212395", "6302091632", "0790700506", "6300183211", "6302814782", "B00005LL26", "B00004TWZK", "B00028HBES", "6304718551", "0790731436", "B00000JKNP", "6300214710", "B000005PFL", "6300270033", "6305428050", "6303224407", "630339406X", "B000035Z2S", "6304117752", "B00003CXIP", "B00003CXQX", "6303148352", "0783216084", "B00005JNQS", "6305326940", "6300263673", "6301792734", "B00080ZFZC", "6304400551", "0790748266", "B00004TJTQ", "0790719029", "6304434340", "B00003CXI0", "6303241123", "6303314015", "B000067FP8", "B00005JKDQ", "B006VRRGNK", "B000C3L27U", "B00000JPH5", "6303953425", "6302765536", "B004Z7AHZC", "B009Z5975A", "B00081912E", "1560395737", "B00001IVED", "6304089767", "B003KV3E3G", "B0052OPJ1E", "B00447L4JG", "B0007KTBIU", "6302914469", "B001BA9FIG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 66611}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.93, "brand": "", "asin": "6303212379", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/512FAC93Y7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]"}
{"description": "Paul Newman shines as cocky poolroom hustler \"Fast\" Eddie Felson in Robert Rossen's atmospheric adaptation of the Walter Tevis novel. Newman's Felson is a swaggering pool shark punk who takes on the king of the poolroom, Minnesota Fats (a cool, assured Jackie Gleason in his most understated performance). After losing big and crashing into a void of self-pity, Eddie meets down-and-out Sarah (Piper Laurie in a delicate performance), an alcoholic blue blood who's dropped into Eddie's world of dingy bars and seedy poolrooms. Eddie regains his confidence and attracts the attention of a shifty, calculating promoter, Bert Gordon (George C. Scott at his most heartless), who offers to bring Eddie into the big money--but at what cost? Rossen brings his film to life with the easy pace of a pool game, giving his actors room to explore their characters and develop into a razor-sharp ensemble. Eugen Sch&uuml;fftan earned an Academy Award for his shadowing black-and-white cinematography, as did art directors Harry Horner and Gene Callahan for their deceivingly simple set designs. Even in the daylight this film seems to be smothered by night, lit by the dim glow of a bar lamp or the overhead glare of a pool-table light, an appropriate environment for this tale of one man's struggle with his soul and his self-esteem. Newman returned as an older, wiser, cagier Felson 25 years later in Martin Scorsese'sColor of Money.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00000I1DI", "630018627X", "B000035Z5G", "1569942072", "6302238331", "6301966066", "6300215962", "630018224X", "6301599225", "6300276740", "0790743531", "6300246965", "6303257739", "B00000FZCU", "6301863194"], "bought_together": ["B00000I1DI"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 283771}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.49, "brand": "", "asin": "630321245X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51E8MNH1TWL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Hustler [VHS]"}

{"description": "No studio was better than Darryl Zanuck's 20th Century-Fox at  dishing out lovingly textured Americana, of which this movie is a prime  example.  The outlaw gets canonized as an American Robin Hood, an  honest farmer who, with post-Civil War Missouri overrun by corrupt  agents of the Railroad, had no choice but to start robbing banks and  trains to achieve a measure of social justice the System wouldn't provide.   Tyrone Power as Jesse is quietly out-acted by Fox's emerging star Henry  Fonda as brother Frank.  The supporting cast is solid--Randolph Scott,  Nancy Kelly, Brian Donlevy, John Carradine (as Bob Ford), Jane Darwell,  Donald Meek--but the liveliest thing in the movie is Henry Hull, playing a  newspaperman whose editorials invariably prescribe that whomever he's  denouncing be \"taken out and shot like dawgs.\" Fonda, Hull, and  Carradine re-created their roles the following year inThe Return of  Frank James.--Richard T.

John Travolta plays a sound-effects man who witnesses what appears to be a tragic car accident killing a presidential candidate. The audio tape he happened to be recording at that moment (adding to his collection of natural sounds), however, suggests but doesn't prove that a murderous conspiracy is afoot. Trying to tease a shred of evidence from murky doubt, Travolta's character turns to a hooker (Nancy Allen) for help and stumbles into a web of evil spun by a right-wing kook (John Lithgow). De Palma's fetishistic fascination with obscured truth in a universe ruled by chance makesBlow Outone of his most operatic films. It's also perhaps one of his most revealing about the inherent decadence of creating verisimilitude for art. Sometimes knocked for its outrageous camera technique,Blow Outcontains several exciting sequences that underscore De Palma's amped-up admiration for many of Hitchcock's best moves.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300269035", "6300270548"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 397992}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.89, "brand": "", "asin": "6303471587", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51B7SQDBXKL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Blow Out [VHS]"}

{"description": "David Lean focused all his talent as an epic-maker on Boris Pasternak's sweeping novel about a doctor-poet in revolutionary Russia. The results may sometimes veer toward soap opera, especially with the screen frequently filled with adoring close-ups of Omar Sharif and Julie Christie, but Lean's gift for cramming the screen with spectacle is not to be denied. The streets of Moscow, the snowy steppes of Russia, the house in the country taken over by ice; these are re-created with Lean's unerring sense of grandness. The movie is so lush and so long that it becomes an irresistible wallow, even when logic suffers--likeGone with the Windbefore it andTitanicafter.

{"description": "Terence Fisher's take on the oft-filmed Robert Louis Stevenson tale offers a clever switch in a handsome, suave, charming Hyde, like Christopher Lee's Dracula as a seductive figure of evil. Paul Massie plays Dr.&nbsp;Jekyll as a distracted intellectual under a (rather phony) beard whose personality-changing drug unleashes his repressed desires and reveals a different side not just of himself, but of his hypocritical best friend. Paul (Christopher Lee) is a smiling viper who leeches off of Jekyll while carrying on an affair with his wife, and soon becomes the smooth-faced Hyde's partner in debauchery through the nightclub underworld of Victorian England. Hyde's violent streak emerges when he targets those who have wronged his weak alter ego (including a truly brutal attack upon his wife) and in his passionate affair with the exotic snake charmer he soon makes his sexual slave. Massie is neither the intense, menacing Hyde nor the tortured Jekyll the part demands; the sides of his personality are better expressed through costars Lee as Hyde's gleefully hedonistic buddy and David Kossoff as Jekyll's conservative and caring friend. Fisher revels in the debauchery of his characters (the Jekyll story often feels like an afterthought), creating an atmosphere of decadence by suggestion and flourish, but his Hyde is a cruel, cold-blooded character, a true Hammer Studios monster behind a friendly face.--Sean Axmaker", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 587036}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "asin": "6303637477", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51N4CYNVV2L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Two Faces of Dr Jekyll [VHS]"}

Molina (William Hurt)  is telling his new cellmate, Valentin (Raul Julia), his favorite story.  Molina is a delicate homosexual imprisoned for seducing a minor; Valentin is a bearded revolutionary still bleeding from his interrogation. If their  film unfolded into the typical prison buddy plot, it'd still be a good  movie.  But this is a great movie. There are stories twisting within stories,  each drawing a new, surprising level of difference between the two heroes: escapism versus realism, romance versus politics, gay versus straight,  hero versus coward. As their unstable friendship grows more real, their  stories become more vivid--whether Molina's fondly remembered Nazi propaganda noir, Valentin's tortured romantic history, or a tropical island fable told merely to pass the time. (Each substory stars Sonia Braga, a neat bit  of casting that further blurs the line between fantasy and reality.) By  the end, each man has changed just enough to taste the other's tragedy--a transformation that gives each the strength to define freedom on his  own terms, despite the brutality of the prison and the bleak world beyond  its walls.--Grant Balfour", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 442844}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.99, "brand": "", "asin": "630383258X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GZ6D65C6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Kiss of the Spider Woman [VHS]"}

{"description": "If aliens came down to earth to see if humanity was worth saving, showing themShort Cuts, Robert Altman's bluesy riff on life in L.A. in the '90s, would not be a good idea. Based on the stories of Raymond Carver (adapted by Altman and Frank Barhydt), this ambitious film is a devilish valentine to living in L.A., where happiness comes at a premium. There are at least eight separate stories that crisscross, most about people who choose not to relate to the lives they are living. Seemingly by design, none of the stories (nor the performances for that matter) have more impact than the others--this is a true mosaic film. The most representative plot deals with a group of friends (Buck Henry, Fred Ward, and Huey Lewis) who decide to keep fishing even after discovering a body in the river. The story works as a morose comedy and a flag holder for the movie: the inability to take the correct action. Others would rather talk about seeing Alex Trebek than discuss their faltering relationships. A huge and talented cast twists in the wind, bumping into moments of truth, sex, and passion. Some even come out all right in the end. The accidental nature of life--a common theme in many Altman films--has never been so maddeningly persistent, or absorbing. The score by Mark Isham with songs sung by Annie Ross (also a cast member) fuels the moodiness, as does the opening number in which Medfly helicopters spray the town to the tune \"Prisoner of Life.\" Delivering the film a year after his biggest hit in two decades,The Player, Altman proved his artistic tenacity as an aged artist with the heart of a new filmmaker: he's not afraid of risking it all.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300181723", "B0001DHSHE"], "also_viewed": ["6301826558"]}, "price": 22.18, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 432267}, "asin": "6303995705", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51D5MBSWWML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Short Cuts [VHS]"}

Like Eisenstein'sBattleship Potemkin, Godard'sBreathless, and Welles'sCitizen Kane, Caligari helped define a cinematic school... and forever changed the way the world made movies. It's also great fun, even for modern audiences.The film begins with two men trading horror stories. One promises the other a terrifying true tale--the harrowing story of his fianc&eacute;e's narrow escape from death. Here's the story: an amoral asylum director wants to see if he can order somnambulist patient Cesare to commit murder. To this end, the nefarious doctor masquerades as a traveling showman and picks victims from the gawking carnival crowds. He sends his sleepwalker out to execute bloody deeds by night--crimes of which Cesare is barely aware. Soon, Cesare abducts the narrator's girl and is caught ... which is only the beginning of the surprises.Caligari's world became the textbook example of 1920s German Expressionist cinema--a cockeyed dreamscape, where black-clad actors feverishly chase each other across moody, barely-realistic sets.

{"description": "This town drama from Ted Demme centers on former classmates  coming together for their 10-year reunion. Scott Rosenberg's (Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead) script thoughtfully passes over the usual grumblings of young adults who can't believe they still live in the same snowbound town. They accept--even welcome--their blue-collar jobs, whether plowing snow or cutting hair. Willie (Timothy Hutton), the lone wanderer, returns to his listless house in a state of flux, the piano-bar circuit wearing thin as is his relationship with Tracy, a well-off attorney (Annabeth Gish). He isn't the only one with problems. Tommy (Matt Dillon) occasionally sleeps with his now-married high school sweetheart Darian (Lauren Holly) while the earnest Sharon (Mira Sorvino) is left to wait. Paul (another thickheaded role for Michael Rapaport) refuses to commit to Jan (Martha Plimpton) until it's too late. Paul is enamored with the idea of the supermodel (the title's \"beautiful girls\") that, he believes, can make life perfect. It's a very satisfying comedy, with some forced poignancy (Willie's description of Tracy as a \"seven and a half\" comes off as a death sentence). Rosie O'Donnell's dissertation on whyPlayboyandPenthousehave ruined males' expectations is much like Meg Ryan's orgasm scene inWhen Harry Met Sally...: it's hilarious, even memorable, never wholly believable.The two wild cards thrown intoBeautiful Girlsgive the film its kick. Uma Thurman enters as the local barkeep's (Pruitt Taylor Vince) radiant cousin. From the big city, she can flirt with the awestruck guys and still keep her head. Willie's real emotional tug is from Marty, the precocious 13-year-old neighbor. If you didn't see Natalie Portman's sophisticated work in theThe Professional, her performance here will come as a revelation. You deeply believe that Willie and Marty are connected despite their age difference. Their courtship will never come to be, but the way the two talk (and talk some more) about their lives is the most insightful part of Rosenberg's script. Everyone's so comfortable in his or her roles that you may truly feel sad when the film ends.--Doug Thomas", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 463054}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.5, "brand": "", "asin": "6304167660", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51F9N80S0ZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Beautiful Girls [VHS]"}

Based on the '60s TV show and an almost impenetrably complex (but nonetheless thrilling) original story by David Koepp (Jurassic Park) and Steven Zaillian (Schindler's List), with a screenplay by Koepp and Robert Towne (Chinatown,Shampoo),Mission: Impossiblebegins with veteran agent Jim Phelps (Jon Voight) and his expert crew embarking on a mission that goes horribly, horribly wrong. But nothing is what it seems. The nail-biting set piece--always a signature of director De Palma (Carrie,The Untouchables)--in which Cruise is lowered from the ceiling to retrieve information from a computer in a high-security vault--is an instant classic. But perhaps even more impressive, at least in retrospect, is a flashback sequence in which two characters attempt to reconstruct a series of events from multiple points of view. It's pretty daring and sophisticated stuff for a big-budget spy movie, but brains were always what put theMission: Impossibleteam ahead of the competition, anyway, no?--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B00FZM412Q", "B0044VB3CK", "B00016UX0K", "B005XUNG5I"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 370174}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.99, "brand": "", "asin": "630420065X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41CTTDNC5EL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Mission Impossible [VHS]"}
{"description": "&quot;Do your parentsknowyou're Ramones?&quot; With those withering words, Miss Togar (Mary Woronov), the uptight neofascist principal of Vince Lombardi High School, addresses the four mop-haired, leather-jacketed members of America's first and most famous punk band. And you know it won't be long before the Ramones's jackhammer riffs are blaring through the public address system at maximum volume, the kids are running--not walking--wild in the hallways (without passes!), and Miss Togar's gulag is re-christened &quot;Rock 'n' Roll High School.&quot; Then, in keeping with the outrageously nihilistic animus of punk, the high school students and the Ramones just blow the place to smithereens. It's a crowd- pleasing, fantasy-fulfillment climax that combines the apocalyptic finale of Michelangelo Antonioni'sZabriskie Pointwith the explosive conclusion of Alice Cooper's &quot;School's Out.&quot;Rock 'n' Roll High Schoolis a blast, a goofy and liberating salute to the rebel spirit behind the teen rock & roll movies of the 1950s, which always pitted the kids' insatiable appetite for fun against the adults' fear-based authoritarianism. The film is emblematic of the disarmingly silly, tongue-in-cheek humor of the youth-oriented B-pictures cranked out in the '50s and '60s by renowned low-budget exploitation mogul Roger Corman (who gave many a hungry young filmmaker, including the creators of this film, their start in the biz), and of the noisy, anarchic energy of '70s punk rock, as personified by the inimitable Ramones. In the words of the maestros' beach-blanket-buzz-saw title anthem, this movie is &quot;Fun, fun, oh baby, fun, fun...&quot;--Jim Emerson", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 328331}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "asin": "6304238118", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51R4A8P5X8L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Rock 'n' Roll High School [VHS]"}
{"description": "Chungking Expresstells two stories loosely connected by a Hong Kong snack bar. In one story, a cop who's been recently dumped by his girlfriend becomes obsessed with the expiration dates on cans of pineapple; he's constantly distracted as he tries to track down a drug dealer in a blond wig (played by Brigitte Lin, best known fromSwordsman IIandThe Bride with White Hair). Meanwhile, another cop who's recently been dumped by his girlfriend (Tony Leung Chiu-Wai, from John Woo'sHard-BoiledandA Bullet in the Head) mopes around his apartment, talking to his sponge and other domestic objects. He catches the eye of a shop girl (Hong Kong pop star Faye Wang) who secretly breaks in and cleans his apartment. If you're beginning to suspect that neither of these stories has a conventional plot, you're correct. WhatChungking Expressdoes have is loads of energy and a gorgeous visual style that never gets in the way of engaging with the charming characters. The movie was shot on the fly by hip director Wong Kar-Wai (Happy Together,Ashes of Time), using only available lighting and found locations. The movie's loose, improvisational feel is closer to Jean-Luc Godard'sBreathlessthan any recent film--and that's high praise. Quirky, funny, and extremely engaging,Chungking Expressmanages to be experimental and completely accessible at the same time.--Bret Fetzer", "price": 7.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 417933}, "asin": "6304267835", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Y5M1X63JL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Chungking Express [VHS]"}

{"description": "Salted pork shanks as leitmotiv in a dark comedy about an absurd love triangle: this is what post-Francocineis all about (food and sex). Spanishtortillas(i.e., potato omelets) are also big in this one. Director Jos&eacute; Juan Bigas Luna'sJam&oacute;n Jam&oacute;nis intelligent, wry, and--despite the formulaic narrative that melodrama must essentially contain--unpredictable. At times his film exudes a certain Almod&oacute;var flavor, but there is an edge, perhaps a heavy-handedness, to the dark humor that is either Luna's success or his downfall. The film garnered the Silver Lion at the Venice Film Festival, after all. Try to follow: sexy Penelope Cruz (Belle Epoque) is growing up with her mother outside town on the highway, on the wrong side of the highway. Together they run a truck stop where cars and life literally race past. Cruz is in love with Jord&iacute; Molla, by whom she is pregnant. Molla's bourgeois mother, played by Anna Galiena (Being Human), thinks he can and should do better. (Of course, neither Cruz nor his mother knows of the erotic, hmm, avian interludes Molla enjoys on the side.) To save her son from the lower classes, Galiena hires Javier Bardem, a muscular, pretty man (whose regular consumption of the pork he distributes for a living has enhanced his sexual appeal) to pursue Cruz. The dark comedy finds a proper ending to the triangle in a grotesque but comedic landscape of death. This is not a cookie-cutter movie but rather one that will resonate with both your light and dark sides.

The special effects, though primitive, certainly get the job done, and it is still a treat to watch the Blob ooze its way to its next meal.

{"description": "Plot is a meaningless term when trying to describeLost Highway. Here, more or less, is what happens:  A noise-jazz saxophonist (Bill Pullman) suspects his wife (Patricia Arquette) of infidelity. Meanwhile, someone is breaking into their house and videotaping them while they sleep. The wife is murdered and Pullman is convicted of the crime. Then, in prison, he transmogrifies into a young mechanic (Balthazar Getty) who is subsequently released, since, after all, he's not the guy they convicted. Getty goes back to his life and meets a local gangster's moll, who happens to be played by Patricia Arquette... but none of this has much to do with what the movie is really about. Dreams are what intrigues director David Lynch. Not friendly, happy dreams; his dreams whisper that what we think is real is just something we made up, something to keep ourselves from falling into chaos. Characters are fragments. Events happen not because they make sense, but because deep down wewantthese things to happen. Of course, in Lynch's dreams, as in our waking lives, getting what we want is not always pleasant. In the movie's best moments, you really have no idea what you're seeing. The screen is a big rectangle of color and shadow, but what it represents, well, it could be anything. And yet, in those moments, you've been given just enough hints of place, character, and story that these elusive images elicit a genuine dread, a sense that you might not want to see this, yet you can't look away; a sense that we are living on borrowed time, that something is fiercely askew in our psyches. As a whole,Lost Highwayis a failure: much of it is padded, gratuitous, and indulgent and pointless cameos bog down an already sluggish narrative. Yet within that failure are moments worth more than the entirety of most successful movies.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0009RRUKW", "B000067DGJ", "6303018351", "6303515304", "6300214044"], "bought_together": ["B0009RRUKW", "6303018351"], "also_viewed": ["B007NYDVV6"]}, "price": 29.87, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 372956}, "asin": "6304510861", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/717FGE5YK8L._SY300_.gif", "title": "Lost Highway [VHS]"}
{"description": "Catherine Deneuve and David Bowie are rich, beautiful, and oh-so chic as denizens of the night. Dressed in sleek outfits and stylish sunglasses, they haunt rock & roll clubs on the prowl for young blood, whom they bring home to their impossibly luxurious mansion for a late-night snack.  Being a vampire never looked more sexy, but there's a price: Bowie starts to age so fast he wrinkles up in the waiting room of a doctor's (Susan Sarandon) office. The agelessly elegant Deneuve, evoking Delphine Seyrig's Countess Bathory fromDaughters of Darkness, is perfectly cast as a millenniums-old bloodsucker who seeks a new mate in Sarandon and seduces her in a sunlight-bathed afternoon of smooth, silky sex. Tony Scott's (Ridley's brother) directorial debut, adapted from the Whitley Strieber novel, revises the vampire myth with Egyptian inflections and removes all references to garlic and crosses and wooden stakes--these bloodsuckers can even walk around in the daylight--but the ties between blood and sex are as strong as ever. Scott's background as an award-winning commercial director is evident in every richly textured frame and his densely interwoven editing, but the moody atmosphere comes at the expense of dramatic urgency. At times the film is so languid it becomes mired in its hazy, impeccably designed visual style. In its own way,The Hungeris the perfect vampire film for the '80s, all poise and attitude and surface beauty. Sarandon talks candidly about the film in the documentaryThe Celluloid Closet.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00000I1GO"], "bought_together": ["B00000I1GO"], "also_viewed": ["6302491908"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 278584}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.75, "brand": "", "asin": "6304509103", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51793HKSJ8L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Hunger [VHS]"}
{"description": "You have a classic tale full of drama, passion, and adventure. A tale of universal archetypes that speak to everyone. A tale that has remained unfailingly popular for thousands of years. Why not spice it up with a wacky mechanical owl? Such was the thinking behindClash of the Titans. Maggie Smith, Laurence Olivier, and Harry Hamlin (one of these things is not like the others...) star in a toga-ripper about a valiant hero, capricious immortals, and lots and lots of giant stop-action monsters. Perseus (Hamlin) is the favored son of the god Zeus (Olivier), but he has unwittingly ticked off the sea goddess Thetis (Smith). Just to make things worse, Perseus falls in love with the lovely Princess Andromeda, who used to be engaged to Thetis's son. Soon Perseus is off on one quest after another, with Zeus helping, Thetis hindering, and lots of innocent bystanders getting stabbed, drowned, and squished. Of course, the whole thing is just an excuse to show as much of Ray Harryhausen's stop-motion animation as possible, and good thing too. It's an old technique, but it still looks pretty darn cool, and it means the cast can just relax and do a bunch of reaction shots. Don't use this one to study for that big classical mythology exam, but if you just turn your brain off and enjoy the Kraken, it's pretty good fun.--Ali Davis", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001DB6J50", "6302182522", "0767847431", "6303257674", "6300216500", "6302360978", "6304071876", "6302098424", "6300146383", "6301976061", "0792839846", "B00023NRSM", "6301163796", "1572524421", "0790743159"], "also_viewed": ["6302182522"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 314532}, "asin": "6304546335", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5183JBADM8L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Clash of the Titans [VHS]"}
{"description": "Halloweenis as pure and undiluted as its title.  In the small town of Haddonfield, Illinois, a teenage baby sitter  tries to survive a Halloween night of relentless terror, during which  a knife-wielding maniac goes after the town's hormonally charged  youths. Director John Carpenter takes this simple situation and  orchestrates a superbly mounted symphony of horrors. It's a movie much scarier for its dark spaces and ominous camera movements  than for its explicit bloodletting (which is actually minimal). Composed  by Carpenter himself, the movie's freaky music sets the tone; and his  script (cowritten with Debra Hill) is laced with references to other  horror pictures, especiallyPsycho. The baby sitter is played  by Jamie Lee Curtis, the real-life daughter ofPsychovictim  Janet Leigh; and the obsessed policeman played by Donald Pleasence  is named Sam Loomis, after John Gavin's character inPsycho.  In the end, though,Halloweenstands on its own as an  uncannily frightening experience--it's one of those movies that had  audiences literally jumping out of their seats and shouting at the  screen. (\"No! Don't drop that knife!\") Produced on a low budget,  the picture turned a monster profit, and spawned many sequels,  none of which approached the 1978 original. Curtis returned for two  more installments: 1981's dismalHalloween II, which picked  up the story the day after the unfortunate events, and 1998's occasionally  grippingHalloween H20, which proved the former baby sitter  was still haunted after 20 years.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005LC4Q", "B000FA57UI", "B000FA57US", "B000Q66Q2O", "B005CFC0N8", "B004P7CNUY", "B0000AOX09", "B004P7CM9Q", "B000VKL6Z2", "B00006LPHA", "B002XD0J80", "B00AQJ8MLY", "B001NPD9LS", "B002YICNE2", "B000GETUDI", "B000FS9FE4", "B001DJLD1W", "B00AEFY2LO", "B00006FI0R", "B00AEFY2WI", "B005CFBYW6", "B00006FDBT", "B00AEFY31S", "B00AEFY37C", "B00005K3NR", "B00004TS0G", "B003UGLCIA", "B0087ZG7UW", "B000I2J68M", "B000V4UFZK", "B0000VCZMK", "B0033B5XCS", "B000AM6OQ2", "B0002JP572", "B002VWNIDG", "B0058S0OMS", "B000099T3M", "B00AEFY1V0", "B002ZG971U", "B00AEFYYH6", "B00003CXCF", "B004LWZW2O", "B001B1UO6W", "B00006FDCD", "B000E1ZBIG", "B004SIP9MY", "B000TSIJWY", "B000WC3864", "B004AC6PMG", "B001DJLD0S", "B000QQJ3Q0", "B004P7CMT6", "B0002CHK1S", "B000FC2GA0", "B008CYDD7I", "B0008191WO", "B0024FADD8", "B0053TWVDC", "B00018D42W", "B00AEFY2AA", "B00DTPRZ24", "B000KJU1KK", "B00AEFY2E6", "B0000CEB6Y", "B0006SGYL0", "B00004Y87O", "B0013D8LAE", "B00005JA8B", "B006ZL1P66", "B000GBEWRU", "B000IMUYJM", "B005J9ZFQG", "B001JFZ1UE", "B007STBUHI", "B000E8M0P6", "6305972001", "B00079Z9WI", "B00005A8XX", "B00009PY4G", "B000FAOC2W", "B000AA4JL6", "B0002C4JJ4", "B0002O7XW2", "B008JFUNYG", "B000HEWEGC", "B002LMSWN2", "B00BM4Q4H6", "B000HCO86I", "B008874968", "0783227434", "B0006SSOHC", "B001JFZ122", "B004LWZW24", "B000Q66Q8I", "B00001QGUM", "B000OYCMLM", "B000PMLJMQ", "B00000ILDD", "B00A1AU72A", "B004SIP9E2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00KDU8HQQ", "B00005LC4Q", "B000VKL6Z2", "B002YICNE2"]}, "price": 19.96, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 349265}, "asin": "6304697961", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51NXT68J3CL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Halloween"}

{"description": "The idea of fusing teen sex-comedy and horror genres into a boffo box-office bonanza seems like classic braindead Hollywood-think... but somehow, beyond all reason, the makers of this film manage to pull it off.

Also excellent is Kristy Swanson as the bubble-headed cheerleader who learns from a Van Helsing-ish stranger (Donald Sutherland) that she's, like, the reincarnation of this pure female warrior and stuff, destined to rid the world--or at least the Valley--of vampires. No sooner is the Buffster being schooled in the ways of vampire butt-kicking (much to the consternation of meek pretty-boy beau Luke Perry) than the lead vampire (Rutger Hauer) and his leering cronies show up, and leading up the pack is none other than Pee-Wee Herman himself, Paul Reubens.

{"description": "If there's one movie Danny Kaye fans fondly remember, it'sThe  Secret Life of Walter Mitty. The versatile comedian--also an unsurpassed  song-and-dance man--plays a henpecked, thriller-genre book writer suddenly  enmeshed in a real adventure involving the (literal) girl of his dreams (Virginia  Mayo). Initially criticized for not staying true to the more melancholic sensibility of  author James Thurber's original story (Thurber allegedly offered producer  Samuel Goldwyn $10,000 tonotmake the film), it not only works as an  independent story, but remains highly entertaining and wears well upon repeated  viewing. Kaye's milquetoast Walter fantasizes distractedly about being heroic,  whether a gunslinger, an Air Force pilot, or a riverboat gambler. His \"Anatole  of Paris\" number, in which Walter fancies himself a French hat designer who,  in the end, declares he hates women, is nothing short of brilliant. That number,  like many of Kaye's trademark patter deliveries, was penned by his wife, Sylvia  Fine. Kaye benefits from a wonderful supporting cast: Mayo; Boris Karloff as  maniacal Dr. Hugo Hollingshead; Faye Bainter as Walter's repressive but lively  mother; Ann Rutherford as his suspicious fianc&eacute;e Gertrude; and Gordon  Jones as Tubby, who not only has designs on Gertrude, but provides the villain  in Walter's fantasies.--N.F.

{"description": "Halloweenis one of the great modern horror films, but as a franchise its track record has been spotty at best, painfully bad at worst.Halloween H2O: Twenty Years Later, directed by horror vet Steve Miner (Friday the 13thparts 2 and 3,House), won't displace John Carpenter's original but it might help you forget the films in between. Miner certainly has: the film begins as if sequels 3 through 6 never happened. Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis, reprising her role for the first time in almost two decades) faked her death and is now a single mom and headmistress of an exclusive California private school. She's also a secret alcoholic who lives in fear of her homicidal brother-bogeyman Michael Myers. Guess who decides to show up for a family reunion? The film begins with classic horror-movie exposition (the deserted college campus, Michael's escape, Laurie's waking nightmares) accomplished with some humor and style, but it's all setup for the second half, a driving roller coaster of stalk-and-slash thrills. There's little of the self-conscious genre referencing ofScreamand at times the film is a little far-fetched--it is a slasher movie about a knife-wielding homicidal maniac who won't stay dead, after all--but Curtis transforms Laurie from a shrieking victim into an empowered, determined horror-movie heroine who's learned a thing or two from the previous films. Adam Arkin, Josh Hartnett, and TV cutie Michelle Williams (Dawson's Creek) costar, and the script received uncredited polish fromScreamwriter Kevin Williamson; Curtis's mom, Janet Leigh, pops up in a cameo.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00023NRSM", "6304136242", "6304288433", "630130053X", "6301562925", "B00008DDU9", "6301589025", "6300248089", "630428845X"], "bought_together": ["B00023NRSM", "6304288433"], "also_viewed": ["6301562925", "6304136242", "630130053X", "B00023NRSM", "B00008DDU9", "0780627032", "6304288433"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 343546}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.25, "brand": "", "asin": "6305171769", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31K7JRAAFAL.gif", "title": "Halloween H20 [VHS]"}
{"description": "By now, Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan have amassed such a fund of goodwill with moviegoers that any new onscreen pairing brings nearly reflexive smiles. InYou've Got Mail, the quintessential boy and girl next door repeat the tentative romantic crescendo that madeSleepless in Seattle, writer-director Nora Ephron's previous excursion with the duo, a massive hit. The prospective couple do actually meet face to face early on, butMailotherwise repeats the earlier feature's gentle, extended tease of saving its romantic resolution until the final, gauzy shot.The underlying narrative is an even more old-fashioned romantic pas de deux that is casually hooked to a newfangled device. The script, cowritten by the director and her sister Delia Ephron, updates and relocates the Ernst Lubitsch classicThe Shop Around the Cornerto contemporary Manhattan, where Joe Fox (Hanks) is a cheerfully rapacious merchant whose chain of book superstores is gobbling up smaller, more specialized shops such as the children's bookstore owned by Kathleen Kelly (Ryan). Their lives run in close parallel in the same idealized neighborhood, yet they first meet anonymously, online, where they gradually nurture a warm, even intimate correspondence. As they begin to wonder whether this e-mail flirtation might lead them to be soul mates, however, they meet and clash over their colliding business fortunes.It's no small testament to the two stars that we wind up liking and caring about them despite the inevitable (and highly manipulative) arc of the plot. Although their chemistry transcended the consciously improbable romantic premise ofSleepless, enabling director Ephron to attain a kind of amorous souffl&eacute;, this time around there's a slow leak that considerably deflates the affair. Less credulous viewers will challenge Joe's logic in prolonging the concealment of his online identity from Kathleen, and may shake their heads at Ephron's reinvention of Manhattan as a spotless, sun-dappled wonderland where everybody lives in million-dollar apartments and color coordinates their wardrobes for cocktail parties.--Sam Sutherland", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302936381", "6303637574", "6301796535", "B0001E7LQG", "0783241569", "0792151712", "0792116887", "0790739909", "B0000VD02E", "6301586026", "B00003CXFU", "6302820448", "6305132666", "B00004WIDB", "6301966988", "6303696813", "B0000DCGT1", "B000007OY0", "5559477621", "6301578805", "6304259131", "0782006779", "6300247236", "6302779278", "6303402348", "630394518X", "0790748169", "630150528X", "6300214222", "6303269842", "0783223218"], "bought_together": ["6302936381"], "also_viewed": ["B0000AOV4I", "6302936381", "B003BV8ICC", "B00008G7UF", "B00006ZXSK", "6302787068", "0790720434", "B00006ZXSL"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 68917}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6305368139", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/513FXJJZ5ZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "You've Got Mail [VHS]"}

Or what exactly fascinated student filmmaker Heather and what possibly took her, Mike, and Josh from this earth? Get all your background questions answered byCurse of the Blair Witch, a one-stop-shopping \"documentary\" originally produced for the Sci-Fi Channel as a tie-in marketing tool. Entirely fictionalized,Curse of the Blair Witchfocuses both on the past and the present, with copious info on the Blair Witch myth as well as on the disappearance of Heather, Josh, and Mike. As it turns out, the original witch was one Elly Kedward, who was accused in 1785 of taking blood from several children; she was subsequently banished to the harsh winter woods and left for dead. Her grisly and bloody legacy involves missing children, polluted water, disemboweled men, and a serial killer of children who claims to have been haunted by \"an old woman ghost.\" Aside from some ineffective \"newsreel\" footage of the serial killer, all this intriguing information is presented convincingly and chillingly.Cursemay in fact freak you out more than the movie, and it evokes the great, pulpyIn Search Ofseries of the '70s, one of the prime inspirations for filmmakers Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez. News clips of the search for Heather, Josh, and Mike lend a v&eacute;rit&eacute; atmosphere to the proceedings, but shed little light on their mysterious disappearance or their characters.

{"description": "Since its debut in themangaweekly \"Sh&ocirc;nen Sunday Comics\" in 1988 and as an anime series a year later, Rumiko Takahashi's gender-bending comedyRanma 1/2has been a popular favorite in both Japan and the United States. The first OAV episodes make it easy to understand why: the stories blend outrageous physical comedy, absurd situations, and likable, obtuse characters with just enough sentiment to keep the humor from becoming mean-spirited. Ryota Yamaguchi's screenplays push the nutty situations to the maximum, and director Junji Nishimura keeps the action moving. School blowhard Kuno hatches a phoenix that looks more like an outsized marshmallow Easter chick than the noble bird of legend: it imprints on Ranma, causing no end of trouble. An enchanted brooch produces 180-degree revolutions in the emotions of Shampoo, the Chinese girl. When she wears the pin right-side up, she chases Ranma harder than ever; when she wears it upside-down, she detests him with equal fervor. A demon escapes after 300 years of imprisonment and possesses members of the cast: Ranma and Ryoga use their martial arts skills to bombard the monster with charms that would recapture it--if they had spelled the magic formula correctly. The filmmakers balance these absurdities with gentle moments that anchor the character relationships. When Akane knits a scarf for Ranma in \"Tendo Family Christmas,\" it looks like it's been attacked by a flock of voracious moths. He happily dons it and hands her a gift he bought with money borrowed from her venal sister Nabiki. Not realizing that Akane's spirit has been trapped in an enchanted doll, Ranma holds it and reflects on the things that make her attractive to him. The warm moments play against the exaggerated slapstick--when Akane punches Ranma, he literally goes flying--and vice versa.Ranmafans will want this three-disc set in their libraries; newcomers will find it an excellent introduction to one of the best-loved anime series of all time. Not rated; suitable for ages 12 and up: minor nudity and cartoon violence.--Charles Solomon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000PHC9FM", "6304937296", "B000EJ9VO8", "B000JVT28G", "6305103429", "B000067J2W", "B00II4S0K2", "B0000C52F4", "B00BCPOFPS", "B000094J7H", "B00F5K1Z40", "B0000640VB", "B00CU6WBMW", "B00DPH7RBU", "B00C75VTTM", "B00CU6WB5Y", "B00D39UQ2W", "B00BCPOFQ2", "B00006LPGU", "B0000A9GLJ", "B00BAWXCRU", "B0000C52HH", "B000PE0GZU", "B0012EM5HY", "B0060ZJ6ZO", "B00HMOWA3W", "B0035CP4NS", "B00CJN84L8", "B00005RZPS", "B0016AK36O", "B0028X6L2I", "B000HT386W", "B00009L53V", "B0000YWKN6", "B00FR2X3JG", "B00000JKNX", "B0001EFTM4", "B007RVUDS4", "B003TX8Q24", "B000228SZK", "B000050IL9", "B00E6881MG", "B000NIBUTY", "B000QXDG9S", "B0002IQH1Q", "B001VG2M6C", "B000WW1YO2", "B001GT9DT8", "B0000C2IWH", "B000T28G3M", "B0039UAA7Q", "B003KO1JQW", "B002SEQ90G", "B00006JMQY", "B000AP31HY", "B000ALM4K8", "B000A2WQUA", "B008DL4MC0", "B0083QJW7A", "B000MMLPGO"], "bought_together": ["B000PHC9FM"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00I462XJS", "B000CCZRBI", "B009RZ890M", "B000PHC9FM"]}, "price": 133.9, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 284313}, "asin": "6305813027", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51MEGRB8JXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Ranma 1/2 - OAV Series, Episodes 1-12"}

Then it's cut to Mitch's hectic life as a sports columnist cum television host and long-term, often  long-distance boyfriend. But this Mick Jackson-directed film slows  considerably after the introductions as former student Mitch (Hank Azaria)  learns his beloved professor is dying of ALS (Lou&nbsp;Gehrig's disease). He  reconnects with his mentor and begins learning from him all over again, this  time about life. Oprah Winfrey produced this 88-minute film, and her renowned  touchy-feely quality is prominent as Mitch learns to love both Morrie and his  own girlfriend.

{"description": "Bicentennial Manwas stung at the 1999 box office, due no doubt  in part to  poor timing during a backlash against Robin Williams and his treacly  performances in two other, then-recent releases,Jakob the LiarandPatch  Adams. But this near-approximation of a science fiction epic, based on  works by Isaac Asimov and directed, with uncharacteristic seriousness of  purpose, by Chris Columbus (Mrs.&nbsp;Doubtfire), is much better than  one would have known from the knee-jerk negativity and box-office indifference.Williams plays Andrew, a robot programmed for domestic chores and sold to an  upper-middle-class family, the Martins, in the year 2005. The family  patriarch (Sam Neill) recognizes and encourages Andrew's uncommon  characteristics, particularly his artistic streak, sensitivity to beauty,  humor, and independence of spirit. In so doing, he sets Williams's tin man on  a two-century journey to become more human than most human beings.As adapted by screenwriter Nicholas Kazan, the movie's scale is  novelistic, though Columbus isn't the man to embrace with Spielbergian  confidence its sweeping possibilities. Instead, theHome Alonedirector shakes off his familiar tendencies to  pander and matures, finally, as a captivating storyteller. But what really  makes this film matter is its undercurrent of deep yearning, the passion of Andrew as a convert to the human race and his willingness to sacrifice all to  give and take love. Williams rises to an atypical challenge here as a  futuristic Everyman, relying, perhaps for the first time, on his considerable  iconic value to make the point that becoming human means becoming more like Robin Williams. Nothing wrong with that.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00003CXXP", "B00008L3U1", "B00000IQV7", "630471193X", "B000N4RAR4", "B004FECNIO", "B00003CWU3", "630542845X", "B00007GZR5", "B00005JN0T", "1558908404", "B000NA1WDQ", "B0045HCJRG", "B000QQLVPQ", "B00079HZOS", "B00005JKIS", "B0043X1FL8", "6305428352", "B002GHHHNI", "B000031EGV", "B000068QPM", "B002NZK5V4", "B000QXDCJ2", "B002GHHHKQ", "B0045HCJ9O", "B0074FURNE", "B00003CWS3", "B00005AB62", "B007JNR4WI", "B00AEFY3MC", "B003PIUIHO", "B00004BZIY", "0385121989", "0783226896", "B00000IQW5", "B00005JKLZ", "B004GJYRA0", "6305144168", "B000HT389E", "0800195175", "B00005JMXX", "B001AQR3MQ", "B0009X75WE", "B002GOAGZC", "B004EPYZSK", "B0036VHJ5Y", "B00003CXIS", "B00AEFXPG2", "6305320950", "B000089796", "0767805712", "B000765IJK", "0783225547", "B00006ZXSK", "B00AEBB8NS", "0767836324", "B00AEBB9SM", "0783230079", "B004A8ZWW4", "B000QUU4LY", "B00004W46I", "B00AEFY4CG", "B00K2CHWYI", "0783232047", "B000QGDY0G", "B00003CXK7", "B004SUDQ2W", "B00HZMZ2FE", "0783225733", "B001CW8016", "B003IQBLSI", "B000YGDNPO", "0780622650", "B0002S64TQ", "B00000G3PA", "6305428077", "B00008979N", "B00003CXQA", "B002UZCJ8Y", "B00AEBB9WI", "B00005JL78", "B00AKGG6JS", "B004SIP9X8"], "bought_together": ["B00003CXXP"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00003CXXP", "B0019ESNGY", "B002NZK5V4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 5667}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 10.14, "brand": "Touchstone Video", "asin": "630587493X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51NF4AW47EL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Bicentennial Man"}
{"description": "John Lasseter and his gang of high-tech creators at Pixar create another entertainment for the ages. Like the few great movie sequels,Toy Story&nbsp;2comments on why the first one was so wonderful while finding a fresh angle worthy of a new film. The craze of toy collecting becomes the focus here, as we find out Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks) is not only a beloved toy to Andy but also a rare doll from a popular '60s children's show. When a greedy collector takes Woody, Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) launches a rescue mission with Andy's other toys. To say more would be a crime because this is one of the most creative and smile-inducing films since, well, the firstToy Story.Although the toys look the same as in the 1994 feature, Pixar shows how much technology has advanced: the human characters look more human, backgrounds are superior, and two action sequences that book-end the film are dazzling. And it's a hoot for kids and adults. The film is packed with spoofs, easily accessible in-jokes, and inspired voice casting (with newcomer Joan Cusack especially a delight as Cowgirl Jessie). But as the Pixar canon of films illustrates, the filmmakers are storytellers first. Woody's heart-tugging predicament can easily be translated into the eternal debate of living a good life versus living  forever.Toy Story&nbsp;2also achieved something in the U.S. two other outstanding 1999 animated features (The Iron Giant,Princess Mononoke) could not: it became a huge box-office hit.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["6304089767", "B00005JKDQ", "B0000AQZYM", "6305326940", "0788805843", "0788812408", "155890641X", "6303314015", "0788802194", "B000035Z2S", "0788805533", "6305229449", "078881172X", "6304500831", "0788812807", "6302526574", "6302642248", "6303983812", "B00003CXQX", "6304401132", "0788806270", "6302787068", "6305940932", "6302320402", "6304290888", "6303534422", "B00275EHJG", "B00004T2SI", "6305319138", "B00005JL95", "0788803743", "6302178924", "6300274268", "6304100507", "6305942285", "B00004R99N", "6300275310", "B00006CXK5", "B00003CXXI", "B00005JMQY", "6304400225", "6304400551", "6302961572", "6303122647", "6304501153", "B00005JKX3", "0788811002", "6300274195", "B0000E32WB", "6303929338", "B00005T7H6", "6304978286", "B00005RDVV", "B00016JF2W", "6302158095", "B0000524CZ", "6304401736", "B000035Z46", "B00003CXHR", "0788812440", "6303036813", "6304089201", "B0007A2GSM", "B00000JS61", "B000028U3S", "B00005RRG3", "6301991311", "B00003CWPW", "B00009L4S1", "6304400381", "6300274608", "B00003CXQ6", "B00000I7Q3", "0788812181", "B000AY74OQ", "6305559295", "0792153677", "B00005LOUS", "0788809806", "078880720X", "B000009CTR", "1558906150", "B00001YX9H", "6301390725", "B00007AJLB", "B00000J2JA", "6304434340", "0783221800", "B00000ICHA", "1558907718", "6303148387", "B00004T2SJ", "6304155972", "6303939015", "0788810448", "6301404440", "630169774X", "B00003CXQ0", "6302968143", "B00006IUM9"], "also_viewed": ["6304089767", "6303314015", "B00005JKDQ", "B0000AQZYM", "0788805843", "6302787068", "0788812408", "6305326940", "155890641X", "0788805533", "0788802194", "6305940932", "6302320402", "078881172X", "6305229449", "6302526574", "6304500831", "B000035Z2S", "B00003CXQX", "6303983812", "6302642248", "6304100507", "6300274195", "6304290888", "0788812807", "0788806270", "6303036813", "6300274268", "6305319138", "B00005JL95", "6304501153", "6300275310", "B00004T2SI", "6303534422", "6305942285", "6302178924", "B00003CXXI", "6304401132", "6302961572", "B0007KTBIU", "6304400551", "6303929338", "6304089201", "B00004R99N", "6304978286", "B0000524CZ", "B00275EHJG", "B00005JKX3", "B00000I7Q3", "B00003CXHR", "6304089112", "6302426200", "B0000E32WB", "B00006CXK5", "B0030IIZ4M", "6305310068", "6304401736", "B00016JF2W", "B000063V8N"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 182756}, "asin": "6305949557", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515BCFM46JL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Toy Story 2 [VHS]"}

{"description": "Pixar genius reigns in this funny romantic comedy, which stars a robot who says absolutely nothing for a full 25 minutes yet somehow completely transfixes and endears himself to the audience within the first few minutes of the film. As the last robot left on earth, Wall-E (voiced by Ben Burtt) is one small robot--with a big, big heart--who holds the future of earth and mankind squarely in the palm of his metal hand. He's outlasted all the \"Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class\" robots that were assigned some 700 years ago to clean up the environmental mess that man made of earth while man vacationed aboard the luxury spaceship Axiom. Wall-E has dutifully gone about his job compacting trash, the extreme solitude broken only by his pet cockroach, but he's developed some oddly human habits and ideas. When the Axiom sends its regularly scheduled robotic EVE probe (Elissa Knight) to earth, Wall-E is instantly smitten and proceeds to try to impress EVE with his collection of human memorabilia. EVE's directive compels her to bring Wall-E's newly collected plant sprout to the captain of the Axiom and Wall-E follows in hot pursuit. Suddenly, the human world is turned upside down and the Captain (Jeff Garlin) joins forces with Wall-E and a cast of other misfit robots to lead the now lethargic people back home to earth. Wall-E is a great family film with the most impressive aspect being the depth of emotion conveyed by a simple robot--a machine typically considered devoid of emotion, but made so absolutely touching by the magic of Pixar animation. Also well-worth admiring are the sweeping views from space, the creative yet disturbing vision of what strange luxuries a future space vacation might offer, and the innovative use of trash in a future cityscape. Underneath the slapstick comedy and touching love story is a poignant message about the folly of human greed and its potential effects on earth and the entire human race.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000VBJEEG", "B001KVZ6FW", "B00007LVCM", "B00BG0RSJ4", "B00AFEX83C", "0736424229", "B00005JN4W", "B00005JNQS", "B0042U94UQ", "B00E9ZATJO", "B001OMU6UM", "B00005JNS0", "B0030IIZ4M", "B0034JKZ86", "B002ZG97YM", "B002WJI2QQ", "B004HO6I4M", "B008YWY0HK", "B0012EM5D8", "B0006UEVT0", "B009SZCC9U", "B004G600A4", "B00AAXFYPI", "B00F522C7C", "B008Z1LBU4", "B00CTNYLQA", "B003H9M1Q2", "B000AAF1TU", "B008JFUQ16", "B000ROAK2W", "B000AY74OG", "B00275EHJG", "B00CWM58WY", "B00009M9BK", "B00EV1YZ96", "B001DPHDCY", "B000MV9026", "B001O5LVPI", "0783231474", "B00CQRN3QI", "B00G5G7EXY", "B00I6JOD2S", "B001HN6922", "B00GDT5T9Y", "B0087F7VSY", "B001U2MQE0", "B0030IIYYS", "B00A83075M", "B00H4Z07Q6", "B005LAIH4A", "B000DWMYQ8", "B00CHVJODE", "B0000AOX0O", "B003UESJF6", "B00JK531ES", "B00HLTD2OE", "B0001I561E", "B00BGYO7HG", "B003ZHVJGO", "B001ILFUD2", "B0002YLCOM", "B0039N74CW", "B00004U9WQ", "B00937R6QC", "B00CUDD0C0", "B004EPZ034", "B00004R99S", "B00003CXB4", "B000065V42", "B00005RDSQ", "B004ZBACOE", "B001GCUO7A", "B00AO686JC", "B000AAF1U4", "B0006JMLRK", "B00005JMQZ", "B0043X1FOK", "B00C7JGDBW", "B001JRB17Y", "B001KVZ6G6", "B00005TN8K", "B00005JMFH", "B00E9ZATKI", "B001ILFUDC", "B000V1Y44G", "B00003CX8Y", "B0011U52E2", "B00EBBGLFC", "B000YERP2S", "B00009YXAW", "B00003CXCQ", "B002NZK5SW", "B000G75AZC", "B00CNW9ZI6", "B0084IHVGG", "B00947N6D8", "B004LWZW7Y"], "bought_together": ["B001KVZ6FW", "B000VBJEEG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004HO6I4M", "B001KVZ6FW", "B00I6JOD2S", "B00005JN4W"]}, "price": 17.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 319062}, "asin": "7883706837", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51u-jDIxUZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)"}

{"description": "Art film and road movie collide forVanishing Point, an existential car chase across the desert in a postEasy RiderAmerica. Barry Newman stars as Kowalski, a taciturn driver who bets that he can drive a new Dodge Challenger from Denver to San Francisco in 15 hours. He loads up on amphetamines and begins his odyssey through the contemporary west while a funky black DJ (Cleavon Little) turns the driver into a folk hero and broadcasts advice on dodging the cops. It's like a counterculture precursor toSmokey and the Bandit, with the road as the last bastion of freedom and the DJ as a combination commentator and mystical guide. The slim plot offers a network of society drop-outs that aid the \"last free Man on Earth\" (as the DJ describes him) on his obscure but obviously symbolic quest while flashbacks paint Kowalski as a world-weary hero. It doesn't really make much sense, but the amazing car chases and excellent stunt work are stunningly set against the American west, beautifully captured by cinematographer John A. Alonzo.Vanishing Pointis most assuredly a product of its time, the heady, anything-goes era of rebellion in the early 1970s.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B007XF0X52", "B00001ODI1"]}, "price": 11.44, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 284038}, "asin": "B000005QH3", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/417GPP7W2BL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Vanishing Point [VHS]"}

{"description": "From the tinkling avante-garde drone of the opening theme,The Twilight Zonepromises a journey into the unknown. The mix of science fiction, the macabre, and O. Henry twists compel viewers to this day, and decades after Rod Serling's acclaimed CBS-TV series left the air it remains one of the great cult classics of all time.Treasures of the Twilight Zonepresents a collection of rarities that were frequently excluded from the show's syndication package. The pilot episode \"Where Is Everybody?\" stars Earl Holliman wandering through an empty ghost town seeking someone, anyone, to break his isolation. The volatile, edgy study in racism, \"The Encounter,\" with Neville Brand and George Takei was pulled from syndication after its initial showing. \"An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge,\" the show's memorable swan song, was the only episode created outside of Serling's production company and his creative control, an award-winning short film from France by Robert Enrico. The real treasures of thisTwilight ZoneDVD, however, remain two of its compelling supplements.

The absurdity of crocodiles in Maine sets the tone for the entire movie, which has no ambitions beyond mixing a little fright with a little humor. Bridget Fonda (Point of No Return,Jackie Brown) plays a paleontologist sent to investigate a large tooth; Bill Pullman (Independence Day,Lost Highway) is a fish and game warden just trying to keep the peace; Oliver Platt (Funny Bones,Flatliners) plays a loose-cannon mythology professor who swims with crocodiles for sport; and Brendan Gleeson (an excellent but little-known actor, most noted forThe General) is a local sheriff with a short temper and a big gun. Add a few gruesome dismemberments, Betty White as a cantankerous old broad who may have murdered her husband, and a cow hanging from a helicopter, and there you have it:Lake Placid.

At 178  minutes, it's long enough to establish the myriad inhabitants of Middle-earth,  the legendary Rings of Power, and the fellowship of hobbits, elves, dwarves, and  humans--led by the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and the brave hobbit Frodo  (Elijah Wood)--who must battle terrifying forces of evil on their perilous  journey to destroy the One Ring in the land of Mordor. Superbly paced, the film  is both epic and intimate, offering astonishing special effects and production  design while emphasizing the emotional intensity of Frodo's adventure.

{"description": "Road Tripis a mostly agreeable, by-the-numbers teen flick with a  handful of inspired sequences, most of them involving MTV's resident disturbed  soul, Tom Green. It concerns a sleepy University of Ithaca student named Josh  (Breckin Meyer) who accidentally mails a video of his sexual encounter with an  infatuation (Amy Smart) to his longtime girlfriend (Rachel Blanchard), who's  seemingly avoiding him while at school in Austin, Texas. Naturally, he recruits  some buddies--Seann William Scott as the lech, D.J. Qualls as the hopeless nerd,  and Paulo Costanzo as the doper genius--to hit the open highway and intercept  the package. Even more naturally, mayhem ensues: A car explodes, a bus is  stolen, a nerd is deflowered, French toast is horribly violated, and an elderly  man bogarts both pot and Viagra.The film's humor is more democratic than politically correct, as everyone--women  and minority characters, not just the hipster white guys--have a hand in the  high jinks. Green plays Barry Manilow (no, not that one), a professional student  (eight years and counting)--he relates the film's story to skeptical prospective  students while leading them on a tour of the college--and thrill-seeking dork  extraordinaire. In particular, in an already justly famous sequence of scenes,  he sadistically anticipates and endeavors to accelerate a mouse's demise at the  jaws of a python. It's very much in the vein ofAmerican Pie, perhaps a  smidgen tamer, but at least its characters don't really learn any dopey lessons  in the end. Director and coscreenwriter Todd Phillips, who earlier made the  much-questioned documentaryFrat House, again proves he's more adept at  staging fictional comic sequences than real ones.--David Kronke", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEFXVW0", "B00AEFYS2M", "B0023TCWE8", "B000069CF0", "B0009ZE9VW", "B00005JMX6", "B00003CXS7", "B000069HQ2", "B000JJ4DNW", "B0009P42WI", "B000IZJZIU", "B003TY2SPO", "B000EMGJAO", "B000BKVQS4", "B001OD4S50", "B00AEFZ3XU", "B002CLKV54", "B00005NTOH", "B005LAIH9A", "B000031WD9", "B002Q4VBPQ", "B000CPH9PM", "B00003CY6D", "B00024JC4E", "B00260HH1W", "B006WXHJLC", "B004SIP8ES", "B00005KA6V", "B0006GANPA", "B000LC3ICE", "B00IMYVCGW", "B003VPX5Y4", "B00AEFYSL8", "B00005JMCT", "B001G5T6GW", "B00003CXE4", "B001J9KJ4I", "B0009HBPN0", "B000WZEZGI", "B00068WOH8", "B00AEBBA2C", "B00005JKMN", "B00000F0AD", "0800141687", "B001L9EXTS", "B00AEFYAMA", "B0026BXHQ0", "B004I9SJH0", "B002FU8IWU", "B0051MKNRC", "B008220BGQ", "B001C0JCBA", "B000BKJ762", "B0000A02TZ", "B004EPYZS0", "B00007AJGM", "B000E6EHE0", "630529142X", "B000RJO56O", "B001DPHDB0", "B00005JL93", "B008R65XUQ", "B0002V7TMY", "B004LWZW5G", "B000BKJ758", "6305310254", "B00005JNZU", "B004EPZ06G", "B004EPZ084", "B0041KKYGU", "0783235070", "B000ELJAEM", "B000FP2OPO", "B00003CXO1", "B004SIP9CO", "B00441GZ1E", "B00003CXPS", "B000FS9UKI", "B000F9RLL2", "B002AS466O", "B00005JMDZ", "6305428549", "B00003CY5A", "6305433925", "B0001XAQ9Q", "B000063RQO", "B00049QJBG", "B003Y5H5B0", "B00081912E", "B002ZG99H2", "B00BTYNXJG", "B0006HBZE2", "B00441GYVA", "B00005JLQE", "B00AEFY0XE", "B00KNALRZ4", "0790730979", "B008R65XNS", "B008JFUORW", "B001KKU9DW"], "bought_together": ["B00AEFXVW0", "B000JJ4DNW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AEFXVW0", "B00AEFYS2M", "B000CPH9PM", "B004GTVU6O"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 59003}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.69, "brand": "Dreamworks Skg", "asin": "B00003CXIY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5142ge7XncL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Road Trip (Unrated Edition)"}

{"description": "Employing shock techniques and sound design in a relentless sensory assault,Requiem for a Dreamis about nothing less than the systematic destruction of hope. Based on the novel by Hubert Selby Jr., and adapted by Selby and director Darren Aronofsky, this is undoubtedly one of the most effective films ever made about the experience of drug addiction (both euphoric and nightmarish), and few would deny that Aronofsky, in following his breakthrough filmPi, has pushed the medium to a disturbing extreme, thrusting conventional narrative into a panic zone of traumatized psyches and bodies pushed to the furthest boundaries of chemical tolerance. It's too easy to call this a cautionary tale; it's a guided tour through hell, with Aronofsky as our bold and ruthless host.The film focuses on a quartet of doomed souls, but it's Ellen Burstyn--in a raw and bravely triumphant performance--who most desperately embodies the downward spiral of drug abuse. As lonely widow Sara Goldfarb, she invests all of her dreams in an absurd self-help TV game show, jolting her bloodstream with diet pills and coffee while her son Harry (Jared Leto) shoots heroin with his best friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) and slumming girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly). They're careening toward madness at varying speeds, and Aronofsky tracks this gloomy process by endlessly repeating the imagery of their deadly routines. Tormented by her dietary regime, Sara even imagines a carnivorous refrigerator in one of the film's most memorable scenes. And yet... does any of this have a point? Is Aronofsky telling us anything that any sane person doesn't already know?Requiem for a Dreamis a noteworthy film, but watching it twice would qualify as masochistic behavior.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0057ZAA6W", "B00005JM23", "6305594333", "B0007CEXYK", "B00005YUPD", "078401213X", "1560252480", "B00H3JHGBC", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00005JMJG", "B000I0QL7I", "B0009A40ES", "B00049QQHI", "B00005ATQB", "B000LAZDPG", "B00003CXZ4", "0792838068", "B0000AC8LR", "0783229526", "6305692572", "B0041KKYEM", "B000QGEB1M", "B00008977H", "B001AR60GK", "B000MGB6NM", "B0045HCJ08", "6305313687", "B001TOD92C", "B00009Y3QI", "B000NO39FG", "B000JBXXYK", "B00008975Z", "6305162026", "B00004UEDQ", "B000068MC2", "B00606OZUY", "B00003CWQR", "B000ERVK4Y", "B000A7DVR2", "B000A9QK6E", "B00EUENWIY", "B0016MJ6T2", "B00005JPAR", "B00008MTXI", "B004SIP95G", "B00AEFXESQ", "B000JMK6LW", "B00004Y6Q5", "B000FVQLQQ", "B000BYA5G4", "B00005JKJA", "B00005JKM2", "B0029LHW68", "B000BBOUUE", "B004FQX5B6", "B000PAAJZ6", "B000N3SU92", "B003YKYX9M", "B00AEBB8O2", "B00007AJF8", "B00A2H9QN8", "B0009WFEDC", "B00GUO2SKA", "B00013RC2K", "B000A7Q2DM", "B00003CXWV", "0792845803", "B001URA5Y8", "B00195I3O0", "B00006AFUR", "B000063JDE", "B00BMKGZVA", "B00AEBB8NI", "B00112S8RS", "B00177YA6U", "0767837398", "B000O76ZQC", "B0052ADP6Y", "B000J10F8C", "B000E6ESU8", "B00009OOFH", "B00005JLRE", "B0059GVBHG", "0767824954", "B00005JLWN", "B00E8G5GU6", "B000QXDCLA", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00004ZETA", "B00AEBB9CS", "B000021Y77", "B00011CZRE", "B002VECM4A", "B00003CXKS", "B006KH6CF4", "B000K7VHQE", "6305127654", "B00AFEXRME", "B004SIP7ZS", "B00020HB32"], "bought_together": ["B0057ZAA6W", "B00005JM23"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005JMJG", "B000MEYKD2", "B0057ZAA6W", "B00005JPAR"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 222264}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 15.36, "brand": "", "asin": "B00003CXP1", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/519CB9K0QML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut"}

{"description": "This is the firstHellraisersequel that doesn't bear the  imprimatur of creator Clive Barker, and that makes it a sequel that manyHellraiserfans will want to disown, but they shouldn't dismiss it altogether. Now under the control of Miramax producers Bob and Harvey Weinstein, the franchise takes an entirely new direction, andInfernois primarily a detective thriller in which a corrupt cop (Craig  Sheffer) takes on a case that will judge his soul and, ultimately, damn him  forever. His judge and jury will be Pinhead (Doug Bradley) and his legion of  twisted Cenobites, but before he can be tried and condemned, Sheffer's cop will watch as those around him are killed off one by one, leaving a trail of blood (and telltale severed fingers) that leads back to the torment of his own youth.So, what you really have here is a variation onIt's a Wonderful LifeandA Christmas Carol, with all the themes reversed to hellish extremes. The plot doesn't hold together all that well, but you can't fault the film for establishing and maintaining a heavily somber tone. This is pretty dark stuff, after all, and althoughHellraiserfans will lament that Pinhead's appearance is relatively brief, he's presented here in an intriguing new light--not merely an icon of pain and suffering, but a giver of counsel and justice to those (like Sheffer's cop) who arguably deserve the eternal anguish they will receive. Does that make Pinhead a good guy? If this otherwise lugubrious sequel achieves anything, it's that it raises that question and lets the viewer decide.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004YCKJFG", "B00006ADFZ", "B004XYOQOA", "B004P7CMPK", "B0053TWVIM", "B0056P6SOG", "6305972001", "B00004Y633", "B000I2J68M", "B002HML6YI", "B0080QOKZM", "B008874968", "B000MV8AC2", "B001AGNMFI", "B000099T3M", "B004P7CM9Q", "B001NPD9LS", "B00BM4Q4H6", "B00AEFY2WI", "B009IV2Z3M", "B00AEFY31S", "B000FA57UI", "B00005LQ0Z", "B00AEFY2AA", "B00005LC4Q", "B00AEFY37C", "B004TJWDJY", "B004AC6PMG", "B00AEFY2LO", "B004P7CNF4", "B000WC3864", "B000VKL6Z2", "B000FA57US", "B0031U8OEK", "B000096I9V", "0783227434", "B0052XU4BK", "B004SUDQ0Y", "B0000ALPFL", "B009B8YNGO", "B000FS9FE4", "B00005NRN6", "B00AEFY2E6", "B0002IQMAM", "B00006IUFV", "B004P7CNUY", "0783230451", "B004SUDQ9K", "B000MV8ABS", "B00EVU3RSW", "B00006LPHA", "B0001611DI", "B001D5C1R6", "B0016MJ6P6", "B002YICNE2", "B0001US7OA", "B0000AOX08", "B00CERJINC", "B001B1UO6W", "B0000CEB6Y", "B00D7AM6M0", "B0000AOX09", "B00B4VSUW4", "B00AEFYV9W", "B001AXOFR0", "B0053TWW9K", "B002KH4KSY", "B000Q66Q8I", "B001JV5BIA", "0780630874", "B005CFBZQ6", "B00005N5RM", "B00006FDBT", "B004P7CNN6", "B0026UZHS2", "B00005JO16", "B0091G7BTM", "B000KJU1KK", "B0033B5XCS", "B000LC3ID8", "B0001LQJMQ", "B0050UEVN2", "B0058S0OMS", "B007I1Q4W2", "B000067FP8", "B0054602SU", "B005J9ZFQG", "B00AEFY1V0", "B000NVT0SO", "B000063US5", "B0009X76PK", "B00079Z9WI", "B00006FI0R", "B00105303S", "B002V3HT2G", "B005QX8UEE", "B00AEBB91E", "B0053FANPY", "B00005N5S5"], "bought_together": ["B004YCKJFG", "B004XYOQOA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0056P6SOG", "B004XYOQOA", "B004YCKJFG", "B008874968"]}, "price": 6.44, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 170962}, "asin": "B00004Y634", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/511F5VDVMNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Hellraiser: Inferno"}

{"description": "In an introductory talk for this production, conductor Julius Rudel  revives the time-honored discussion of whetherSamson et Dalilashould be  treated as an oratorio (Saint-Sa&#xEB;ns's original intention) or an opera (his final  decision). The San Francisco production chooses a solidly operatic approach,  leaning more toward the style of a Hollywood biblical epic than that of an  oratorio. Operatic features include colorful (even downright exotic) costumes,  brisk tempos, hyperactive choreography for the orgiastic bacchanale, generally  brisk tempos, and a spectacular ending that brings down not only the curtain but  the scenery.The story of Samson and Delilah excites skepticism in many modern minds; it is  the story of a superhero who loses his power because of a haircut, suffers  captivity, is blinded and humiliated, and gets his strength back just long  enough for a spectacular suicide that destroys his enemies. The San Francisco  visuals, exaggerating improbabilities, do not make it easy to suspend disbelief.  But the singers go right to the psychological and emotional heart of this tale  of seduction, betrayal, repentance, and expiation. Shirley Verrett and Placido  Domingo were their generation's most celebrated exponents of the title roles.  They were at their peak in 1981 when this performance took place, and they  generate enormous emotional power. They are well-supported by an excellent cast,  notably Wolfgang Brendel (Le Grand-Pr&#xEA;tre de Dagon) and Arnold Voketaitis  (Abimelech).--Joe McLellan", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00008DDRN", "B003Y58CKI", "B00005UW8C", "B001RPZDVS", "B0002CX4RM", "B00HZ3L25M", "B007R5KKJW", "B000094HMU", "B003ZWTGKU", "B00005NGA8", "B00012AST0", "B00406UK8W", "B001RPZDW2", "B004QQDUZ6", "B0002UNQ5Y", "B002Y5FKZ4", "B0007P0LN4", "B0007P0LO8", "B000T0XEGS", "B00008DDRL", "B0000DI86O", "B0006O9M6S", "B000A0XS0Y", "B00CU55HMY", "B008K7RGA2", "B0001BPPO4", "B00H540KMM", "B005MYEQ9U", "B00005N5SJ", "B00361DR4Q", "B002LL13BQ", "B00006J9OV", "B00I3LDEFQ", "B00579EKXC", "B003ELZL0Q", "B000050X2Z", "B00005RIXS", "B00019GH8E", "B000EQHHJW", "B007C7FFNG", "B002MEW7YY", "B000PC1N40", "B000EQHHK6", "B00005BI90", "B0007Q6PBK", "B00CIWPJ0Y", "B0002K70C4", "B0082RSL04", "B0038Q3UKK", "B00CSI6JP2", "B00INVOOSC", "B000059QY3", "B000NVL49W", "B0013V33DG", "B0000640T8", "B000OONQ1M", "B0007P0LNE", "B000OONQ1W", "B00009PY2C", "B000A3VTT8", "B001RPZDXG", "B003Y58CLC", "B00H28A5N0", "B0001AEU5K", "B000VLYIW4", "B00H540M9S", "B0002HODCM", "B000068UXH", "B00IAD18FK", "B000YCLRBA", "B00579EKW8", "B005HS5RWQ", "B000B8ISPK", "B000294T3I", "B000I8OFKA", "006059876X", "B001LMSP26", "B0000640T2", "0738919039", "B000083C73", "B000093FQI", "B00H28A5EO", "B00008DDRJ", "B0079IJ17E", "B00579EK50", "B001CZVVV4", "B000GWBRPO", "B0007TFI9W", "B00FABG4M2", "B007CYKHIW", "B00CU55HHY", "B00066K2R4", "B006ZRAF0C", "B000MGB3EE", "B004J726UC", "B00008AORE", "B0000631A7", "B0054YIQLW", "B000F3T3CS", "B0012L0TEI"], "bought_together": ["B0002CX4RM"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0002CX4RM", "B00000DGWS", "B00ALTQRUC", "B000002RSS"]}, "price": 22.38, "categories": [["CDs & Vinyl", "Classical"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Opera & Classical Vocal"], ["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 203655}, "asin": "B00004ZEQF", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51iF5gUlhNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Saint-Saens - Samson et Dalila / Rudel, Domingo, Verrett, San Francisco Opera"}
{"description": "In this second two-disc set of adventures, Gene Starwind and Jim Hawking shift operations to the planet Heifong, accompanied by the lovely assassin Suzuka and the cyborg Malfina. The Ctarl-Ctarl alien Aisha Clanclan joins them as a rather fractious partner. During a high-stakes space race, Gene discovers that MacDougall, the enemy he met in episode 9, is really two brothers: Harry, a psychotic cyborg, and Ron, a gelid sadist. Nasty as they are, the MacDougall brothers are small potatoes compared to the real threat Gene and his friends face. In \"The Seven Emerge,\" Lord Hazano, the head of the 108 Stars pirate gang, sends a band of dreaded murderers after them. Hazano wants Gene's ship, theOutlaw Star, which rebel pirate \"Hot Ice\" Hilda gave him before she was murdered by the MacDougalls. A secret coalition of pirates and Space Force agents developed the ship: with Malefina acting as its guidance system, it's the only vessel capable of reaching the fabulous treasure hidden at the Galactic Leyline. Although he's unable to discover the nature of the treasure or the location of the Galactic Leyline, Gene resolves to take his crew there at the end of episode 18. But there's still time for plenty of comic adventure, including Gene's entry in the distaff events of the Galactic Strongman Contest as \"Jenny.\" Rhinestone-in-the-rough Gene Starwind may remind viewers of a cross between Kain Blueriver inLost Universeand Vash the Stampede inTrigun. Like Kain, he comes out on top in misadventures that never quite cover his expenses, and he's as formidable a marksman as Vash. But he lacks the metaphysical bent that enables Kain to wield a psi blade, and the viewer looks in vain for Vash's reverence for life and self-deprecating charm.Outlaw Stardelivers an engaging, rather dark brand of comedy-adventure, although the clean-up artists on the series do very sloppy work: Gene's features change noticeably from scene to scene.

{"description": "On May 6, 1993, the mutilated bodies of three 8-year-old boys were found in a shallow creek in West Memphis, Arkansas. A short time later police arrested three local teenagers, linking the boys' killings to a satanic ritual. One of the boys confessed. The intriguing court case was about to unfold as filmmakers Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky ventured forth to make this documentary. They captured footage of not only courtroom proceedings but also interviews with the major players in trial--parents, suspects, lawyers. The documentary filmmakers, whose previous film,Brother's Keeper, is as intriguing of a crime story you'll ever see, tells this story without re-creations or flashbacks. The film makes a clear argument that the court trial may not be about witchcraft but a witch hunt. As with any great drama, the faces and situations are etched upon the viewer; however, we are dealing with real lives and real crimes (told gruesomely and necessarily by police photographs and videotape), and the impact is far greater. And so is the maddening ambivalence of the trial. Like the O.J. Simpson fiasco, a verdict is reached but the truth is questioned. Did police make fatal errors the night of the crime? Do last-minute clues lead to justice? Who's lying on the stand? As withRoger and MeandHoop Dreams, we have a provocative single incident that holds a mirror to many of society's problems. The results are just more horrifying.

{"description": "Continuing the \"alienation trilogy\" that began withL'Avventuraand ended withL'Eclisse, Michelangelo Antonioni'sLa Notteis a visually arresting, emotionally numbing exercise in chronic ennui.

Antonioni's pained study of modern detachment is richly supported by his visuals, often placing his isolated characters in a harsh landscape of empty glamor and even emptier emotions. Driving the point home is Monica Vitti as Marcello's would-be mistress; in their aimless lassitude, neither can muster the necessary passion.

{"description": "It's a good thing Sandra Bullock knows her strengths and weaknesses, because without Bullock as star and producer,Miss Congenialitywould be an insufferable mess as opposed to being a mildly enjoyable trifle that is custom-made for Bullock's established screen persona. Only Bullock's fans could really appreciate this fluff (even then they'll wish its ripe premise had been more intelligently handled), but it's not without some highlights to accompany Bullock's reliable charms. Here she plays clumsy, nerdy FBI agent Gracie Hart, who is given the horrific pseudonym Gracie Lou Freebush (one example of the movie's juvenile tendencies) when assigned to infiltrate a beauty pageant to investigate threats of a terrorist attack.Transforming Bullock from frumpy to stunning is a piece of cake (although she gives pageant coach Michael Caine a run for his money), so the movie's premise is trivial at best. More enjoyable is her character's uncouth disdain for pageant contestants and her mistaken perception that they're all a bunch of bimbos. The movie nicely charts Gracie's realization that her own pageant makeover provides a much-needed ego boost. In addition to Caine's effortless scene-stealing, pageant host William Shatner and organizer Candice Bergen are smart choices for comedic support (Shatner's a perfect Bert Parks wannabe), but the movie desperately needs a credible foundation for its comedy to really pay off. Bullock's bureau boss (Benjamin Bratt) is an unconvincing dimwit, and none of the plotting is as smart as sayBeverly Hills Copin combining procedure with laughs.

{"description": "An enormously entertaining (if somewhat shallow) affair from blockbuster   director Steven Spielberg. Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Frank Abagnale,  Jr., a  dazzling young con man who spent four years impersonating an  airline pilot, a  doctor, and a lawyer--all before he turned 21. All the  while he's pursued by a  dedicated FBI agent named Carl Hanratty (Tom  Hanks), whose dogged determination  stays one step behind Abagnale's  spontaneous wits. Both DiCaprio and Hanks turn  in enjoyable  performances and the movie has a bouncy rhythm that keeps it  zipping  along. However, it never gets under the surface of Frank's drive to lose   himself in other identities, other than a simplistic desire to please  his father  (Christopher Walken, excellent as always), nor does it  explore the complex  mechanics of fraud with any depth. By the movie's  end, it feels like one of  Frank's pilot uniforms--appearance without  substance.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00080ZG10", "B006OFN0SE", "B000M341QE", "B00AEBB8NI", "B001EZE5DI", "B004SIP7TE", "B000MZHW40", "0767905385", "B00005JMYC", "B002ZG980U", "B00049QQHI", "B0016Q2D66", "B00AEBB9F0", "B00003CWM3", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B000P0J0EW", "B00008DP4C", "B000PHVZNE", "B001N44BVQ", "B00005JOC9", "B004SIP7ZS", "B0007DFJ0G", "B007SPPANM", "B00H9KKGTO", "B002T9H2LA", "0800141806", "B000N6U0E2", "B000P0J0EM", "B00AEBB89W", "B000FVQLQQ", "B00001ZWUS", "B0050546MS", "B00DHHWXYY", "0783225733", "6304711891", "B00AEFY0F2", "B002VWNIEA", "B0051MKNV8", "B002ZG99N6", "B0077ATSSQ", "B00011CZRE", "B0013XZ2QK", "B00275EGWY", "B00005JKBC", "B00003CXWV", "B002O5M4T4", "B002FU8IWU", "B008MILL8W", "B004XQO90O", "B004SIP95G", "B000YAF4MA", "B005LAIIJY", "B00005JMJG", "B002QEHPQU", "0780631536", "B00DHDDE32", "B0031OCY2E", "0783240295", "B000P0J0BK", "B004FQX5B6", "B0034G4OUO", "B005HWAOP2", "6305313687", "B003UESJH4", "B000YABYLA", "B00005JKWX", "B00BEIYL6G", "B0058JEHSO", "B000A7DVR2", "B0002ZDVEU", "B00003CXZ1", "B00003CXQ4", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00005RYLX", "B001VPCINK", "B000FKO5QK", "B0045HCJRG", "B009POCG0Y", "B00AEBB9SM", "B002UZCJ8Y", "B002DU39GW", "6304806434", "B00JQYV0B4", "B00AEFXE9U", "B00004WG2F", "B000EXZFCQ", "B00005JMCN", "B00006RCNV", "B000K7VHQE", "B00441GYXS", "B00A24CAAW", "B0045HCJ8K", "B004SIP9Z6", "B002NZK5R8", "B000K7VHTQ", "B00AEFXXMI", "B00005JL78", "0783233477", "B000J3OTT6", "B000O77SRC"], "bought_together": ["B00080ZG10", "B000M341QE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004SIP7TE", "B002ZG980U", "B00AEBB8NI", "B00ALTQRPW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 7335}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.99, "brand": "Dreamworks Skg", "asin": "B00005JLSB", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51bPnAto--L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Catch Me If You Can (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition)"}
{"description": "With its disturbing images and a few good shocks,The Ringis the kind of frightfest you'll watch to set a chilling mood or spook your susceptible friends, but when you try to sort it out, this well-mounted American remake (of the 1998 Japanese hitRingu, based on Koji Suzuki's popular novel) becomes a batch of incoherent parts. The negligible plot follows a Seattle reporter (Naomi Watts) as she investigates the death of her niece, the victim of a mysterious videotape that, according to urban legend, causes the viewer's death seven days later. (Fear Dot Comborrowed the same idea while avoiding this film's lofty pretensions.) The countdown structure follows the reporter, her son, and her estranged boyfriend into deepening layers of terror--all quite effective until the movie attempts to explain itself. At that you're better off shutting down your brain and letting the creepy visuals take over.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0009X763M", "B0006SGYL0", "B004SIP92O", "B00001QGUM", "B00151QYOO", "B001P3SA9Y", "B009XTF8KQ", "B004LWZW24", "B00004BZIY", "B0021L8UFI", "B001JNNDJM", "B000V4UFZK", "B000PMLJMQ", "B0021L8UPS", "B000TJ6PBK", "B0019X3YX2", "B00005RHGK", "B00BEIYMAG", "B0026LQM2Q", "B00005JNJR", "B003UGLCIA", "B000IHY9TS", "B002VWNIDG", "B00AIBZLVY", "B00AEBBA2W", "B00006FDCD", "B008JFUNYG", "B00EZ50SGW", "B00B96TGQS", "B00005JL3T", "B000BTJDGC", "B00AJLHUA8", "B000OVLBGM", "B000RIWAVW", "B003VA3JUO", "B00DW5IM14", "B00005JNY3", "B0021L8UXA", "B00008LUNW", "B000F6IOAM", "B001D2WU9I", "B002JT69IW", "B000AA4JL6", "B00174RCHW", "B00AQJ8MLY", "B00386EZUY", "B0000VCZMK", "B00018D42W", "B0000E2R6P", "B0006SSOHC", "B001U0HBQA", "B00004TS0G", "B003L20IEW", "B008F283VS", "B001DJLD1W", "B0053TWVDC", "B00007G1ZB", "B0015ET3YO", "B00011CZRE", "B004LWZW2O", "B002ZG971U", "B000088NQR", "B002LMSWN2", "B00AEFXSLE", "B0000648X0", "B00005JOWW", "B00005JNNT", "B0031U8OEK", "B006CXIKYC", "B001MVYUR0", "B004SIP9P6", "B003UN0752", "B001NPD9LS", "B008WAM2E2", "B001B1UO6W", "B000GBEWRU", "B00AZTUUQK", "B0002DB54A", "B004SIP9O2", "0780631684", "B003LR5BD0", "B000GCFO0I", "B000VKL6Z2", "B005CFBYW6", "B008G33PIM", "B000GSYRY6", "B0010X73ZG", "B000AM4P9K", "B000A5045Q", "B000056T5E", "B005TK23PQ", "B004BLJQOK", "0783116926", "B001DZOC6Y", "B00BEIYG98", "B005LAIGOQ", "B0097C046W", "B0013FDM7E", "B00BEIYGT8", "B0001FR3IQ"], "bought_together": ["B0009X763M", "B0006SGYL0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004LWZW24", "B000V4UFZK", "B00BEIYMAG", "B00005JNY3"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 99771}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.79, "brand": "Dreamworks Skg", "asin": "B00005JLTK", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51MKWPKHSTL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Ring (Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "TheNemesisDVD is distinguished by excellent picture and thrilling sound, especially in the starship battle sequences.  The bonus features are much more generous than the offerings on previousStar Trektheatrical films other than the two-disc special editions.  There are four featurettes (46 minutes total) discussing the casting of Shinzon, development of the story line, shooting the action scenes, and the themes of family and change that run through the film.  Director Stuart Baird contributes a commentary track that is a bit dry and sometimes silent.  He mentions how he's not aTrekinsider and that because he was working in an established setting he didn't have the freedom of creation that directors usually do.  He also discusses the mechanics of shooting and points out where certain scenes were shortened or eliminated.  Seven of the cut scenes appear on the DVD, some introduced by Baird or Patrick Stewart.  They're interesting to see (and the alternate ending is pretty funny), but none was a great loss from the finished film.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00000ILBK", "6305181721", "B002I9Z8EO", "B0000UJL96", "B0000AUHOH", "B00DB97LRC", "B00005JKHP", "B002I9Z8BM", "B002I9Z8AS", "B00008GEK4", "B002HWRYJE", "B00AZMFJYA", "B002I9Z8I0", "B000F7CDY4", "B000CCBCIA", "B008JLETMM", "B001J4E1CY", "B000HC2PLS", "B001TH16CY", "B00151QY9Y", "B0000UJLVY", "B00005OAZZ", "B007WCJM1C", "B001M4YZ90", "B000BKDNX0", "B00JJ3EH6C", "B000063V8S", "B000FEBWTY", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B002XTXG1G", "B00005Y1NF", "B00BHWG0CM", "B001PUTN3Y", "B000063V8T", "0780622650", "B001TH16CE", "B00BHWG0DQ", "B0002VEWCE", "1415713812", "B001ASPO7K", "B001TH16D8", "B00005JNTU", "B00006HBUJ", "B0000844I8", "B000AYELVA", "B001EDVNNU", "B001DHXT3Y", "B000M53GN6", "B0009X7BDC", "B00000ILDF", "B000HCO83Q", "B001GCUO1Q", "B000RPCK1U", "B00HEPDGKA", "B008JFUO72", "B000063V8R", "B001DHXT6G", "B00003CX5P", "B001RHGRT8", "B00BEZTMFY", "B00C2CDJ34", "B00CTSDDVO", "B0017VG69U", "B004LWZW42", "B000AYELVU", "B000HEWEJ4", "B00005JLXH", "B005FNLUR4", "B000228EBS", "B000NIBURQ", "B000291Q52", "B005LAIGXW", "0783225520", "B0007X7044", "0767803434", "B00AEFYGBA", "B000M53GM2", "B0045HCJ9O", "B000NIBUR6", "B000VI70QS", "B00005JLF5", "B000NTMA0Q", "B00CAATSME", "B000MR9CXW", "B004LWZWGA", "B0001NBNFW", "B007REV4T8", "B000RPCK1A", "B000M53GMW", "B008SAPCTS", "B000ASDFEA", "B00005R2IS", "B000RPCK1K", "B00008G8M4", "B000OVLBHG", "B001DHXT20", "B00E5I2M6I", "B00000ILDH", "B001DTPZNY"], "bought_together": ["B00000ILBK", "B002I9Z8EO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002I9Z8GM", "B002I9Z8I0", "6305181721", "6305127638"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 136962}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.89, "brand": "Generic", "asin": "B00005JLRT", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/519EJJQ3GNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Star Trek - Nemesis (Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "They'll be dancing (well, leaping maybe) in the streets now that the first season ofQuantum Leap, voted one of the 25 best cult series ever byTV Guide, has come to home video, a decade after its final year (1994) on the air (the pilot episode was released on DVD in '98). And why shouldn't they? This is a show, called \"an imaginative diversion\" by one critic, with a good premise that's cleverly and skillfully conceived, written, acted, and produced--ample evidence of which is spread out over three discs, each containing three episodes (plus some fairly meager extras) from the first season.Scott Bakula, in the role that made him a star, plays Sam Beckett, a scientist who's part of a time-travel experiment that \"went a little... ka-ka.\" Unable to return to his own time, and aided only by Al (Dean Stockwell, whose rapport with Bakula is one of the series' most appealing elements), his cigar-smoking, peculiar-dressing, sex-obsessed, holographic \"enabler,\" Sam \"leaps\" unpredictably from one time period and person to another, usually completely out of his element (as a pilot, a boxer, a cowboy, an English lit professor, even an elderly black man in segregated '50s Alabama) and always in a situation that needs to be \"made right\" before he can leap onward. Generous helpings of humor, drama, physical action, and sentimentality (thisisTV, after all) keep things moving, as do references to many other classic films and genres (Driving Miss Daisyin \"The Color of Truth,\"Casablancain \"Play it Again, Seymour,\" boxing in general in \"The Right Hand of God\") and what creator Donald Bellisario calls the occasional \"kiss with history\" (Sam crosses paths with the young Buddy Holly and Michael Jackson, among others). It doesn't all work, asQuantum Leapoccasionally becomes too cute and facile for its own good. But that and the set's paucity of bonus material (limited to one passable featurette and brief episode intros by Bakula) are the only real shortcomings of a boxed set that will likely earn multiple spins in the DVD player.--Sam Graham", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0002NY81C", "B0007UDCX0", "B000CQM4YM", "B000HT3Q2I", "B00022FWEU", "B0011FLGZQ", "B0009JE6FC", "B000YA82GA", "B0006UEVTK", "B0006IUDXA", "B0028SVY20", "B005X4P3DC", "6305186723", "B0007Y08SS", "B000PFUAN2", "B0009X76ZA", "B000GTLB4Y", "B00HUPC5QU", "B000SQFC2M", "B000LXGXY8", "B00FWMVVJ0", "B00JK47BHM", "B000A6CLL0", "B000ERVJMC", "B000GG4Y28", "B000FFJ8BM", "B00005JO3P", "B000BDH6DK", "B000CNESLW", "B003BNO9GO", "B000BUE5D2", "B0009W5J3M", "B000MGBLFK", "B000OVLMKC", "B000BZISRQ", "B000001P1G", "B000BGR1B4", "B000CELOV8", "B001J0FVYK", "B000N2HD6O", "B000BF0C8E", "B003BGZ61S", "B00BUWD7NE", "B000AOEMXC", "B001J2XROY", "B007THQ1VY", "B000MX7V66", "B00JDCP0QA", "B0034BAKL6", "B002LFQIL2", "B00023GGAI", "B0009I7NGW", "B000GW8UAE", "B000XJD3JS", "B00HRUQAKU", "B00H4ZEJ6K", "B000MLWQ6I", "B000E5KQMI", "B000ATQYWY", "B002MXG570", "B00105307O", "B0049GYXBS", "B004GJYR82", "B00GT4NCBU", "B000LC4Z8K", "B0009UC80G", "B001CY5N00", "B0007TKH66", "B000BOH986", "B001KZVQK2", "B00005JOJR", "B00HV0TJM2", "B000F9T70A", "B000BR9SA0", "B001CQONOA", "B000E5KQM8", "B000XJD3K2", "B00HQLZCIQ", "B000BT96EG", "B000S6LS6Q", "B0009JE6G6", "B001MVYUQG", "B002BWP2IK", "B000NTMA1U", "B00GTZWZH6", "B000HEVZ7Q", "B000EWBNMS", "B000BUE5DC", "B001JNNDRY", "B000WTZ6SK", "B001JFKWE4", "B000KGH00C", "B00E96AWY0", "B0037AGB9O", "B00005JMHI", "B00344EAKA", "B002GP7ZV4", "B00H4ZEJCO", "B000M9BPGC", "B005UL4NH0"], "bought_together": ["B0002NY81C", "B0007UDCX0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00JK47BHM", "B0002NY81C", "B000CQM4YM", "B0007UDCX0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 25779}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 23.5, "brand": "Quantum", "asin": "B00005JM3A", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Q3AXRR1YL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Quantum Leap: Season 1"}

{"description": "Even though it's only a single disc, the28 Days LaterDVD includes a lot of very interesting features, including the alternate ending that was shown after the end of the film a couple months into its theatrical run.  It's much bleaker, as director Danny Boyle and writer Alex Garland say in their optional commentary.  Another alternate ending is almost the same as the theatrical ending but slightly less happy.  Most interesting is the \"radical\" alternate ending that takes an entirely different path midway through the film.  It wasn't filmed, however, so Boyle and Garland narrate the action over storyboards, and it's a surprisingly engrossing 11 minutes.  Boyle and Garland also did a commentary track for the film, and they talk about how they were able to get the shots of deserted London and why they used the ending they did.  There are also six very watchable deleted scenes, and Boyle and Garland's comments range from \"great sequence\" to \"a disgrace.\" Slightly less relevant is a 24-minute documentary that spends its first 10 minutes on the real-life threat of infectious diseases before recapping the film and discussing such elements as the use of digital video and the boot camp the actors had to attend. If you need any further proof that the DVD was a labor of love, even the stills galleries have commentaries.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000TJBN80", "B0002ABURA", "B0006A9FKA", "B002WY65VU", "B00111YM5Q", "B0013D8LAE", "B000IHY9TS", "B000Y7U98C", "B00005JO16", "B0021L8UXA", "B0001611DI", "B0013D8LA4", "B000RJO56O", "B002JT69IW", "B001D2WU9I", "B002VWNIDG", "B0002CHK1S", "B00D7AM6M0", "B003UGLCIA", "B00AEFYYH6", "B001MVYUR0", "B000UAE7O0", "B003EYVXYG", "B000EHRVP6", "B0028DRGDQ", "B0021L8UPS", "B001NPD9LS", "B005LAIIMG", "B000FAOC2W", "B000LP6KNU", "B0006SSOHC", "B000WC3864", "B0013FDM7E", "B00000K3TO", "B000RIWAVW", "B000GCFO0I", "B000O76ZQC", "B004LWZW24", "B000RJO578", "B002VKB0KG", "B006ISJR7U", "B00004TS0G", "B004SIP9MY", "B002VKE1K2", "B00G5GNYY2", "B000N6TX1I", "B0024FADD8", "B005QUQRBU", "B001MYIXAC", "B00D3DJIG8", "B001GUYB08", "B000TGJ80S", "B000V4UFZK", "B004SIP92O", "B00009MGEM", "B0010X73ZG", "B00005K3NR", "B002LMSWN2", "B000063RQQ", "B00000ILDD", "B004BZ5AN2", "0767802519", "B00001QGUM", "B00AJLHUA8", "B002SJIO4A", "B00005JMUA", "B00J5LXT6M", "B005J9ZFQG", "B000QQJ3Q0", "B000AXWHSA", "B00BEIYMAG", "B00005JLWN", "B004BLJQOK", "B0015ET3YO", "B008220BLG", "B000031WD9", "B000069HZP", "B000EQ5SRK", "B0007Y08QA", "B000PMLJMQ", "B000BUNZY2", "B002ZG98UA", "B000V4UH08", "B001JNNDJM", "B003HKN52U", "B003UAKEBW", "B0007DFJ0G", "B0019X3YX2", "B00CE00ZV8", "B00003CXCF", "B0009WFEDC", "B000FS9FE4", "B00005JNJV", "B00011CZRE", "B002T9H2LA", "B000RW5BZ0", "B00005JMXX", "B000WC389G", "B007STBUHI", "B002ZG983M"], "bought_together": ["B000TJBN80", "B002WY65VU"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B008SAPC20", "B003J42JLC", "B000Y7U98C", "B0002ABURA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 37382}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.25, "brand": "Twentieth Century Fox", "asin": "B00005JMA8", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/511KHM89SFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "28 Days Later (Widescreen Special Edition)"}
{"description": "In terms of alluring female nudity,Swimming Poolshows a lot, but it's what remains concealed that gives this erotic thriller a potent, voyeuristic charge. With his Hitchcockian handling of secrets and lies, prolific French director Fran&#xE7;ois Ozon reunites with hisUnder the Sandstar, Charlotte Rampling, to tell a seductive tale of murder and complicity, beginning when British mystery novelist Sarah Morton (Rampling) seeks peace and relaxation at her publisher's French villa, only to find his brash, sexually liberated daughter Julie (Ludivine Sagnier) arriving shortly thereafter to disrupt her solitary reverie. What begins as mutual annoyance turns into something more sinister and duplicitous, alternating between Julie's predatory sex with men and Sarah's observant, perhaps jealous fascination. These two women, generations apart, share in Ozon's delicate dance of trust, curiosity, and gradual understanding, until a twist ending that forces you to reevaluate everything you've seen. Only then will the mysteries ofSwimming Poolbe fully and tantalizingly revealed. (Note: The unrated version contains full-frontal nudity that's been edited from the rated version.

{"description": "Like any DVD blockbuster from producer Jerry Bruckheimer, the extras are plentiful and often a bit too self-congratulatory (worst offender here is the primary commentary track). The slickly (natch) produced making-of documentary goes through the standard routine; however, the less-flashy \"fly on the wall\" bits--just showing what happens on set without comment--is more fun, offering effortless insight on the filmmaking process. The best treasure is a nifty interactive history on pirates with plenty of background material. You can simply play the filmed segments or take a tour around a ship to discover the material (and a few surprises). There's a lot of archival material on the theme-park ride that inspired the film and several odds and ends including an enjoyable chronicle of the vintage ship's voyage from its home harbor to the movie set.

{"description": "Jamie Foxx's uncannily accurate performance isn't the only good thing aboutRay. Riding high on a wave of Oscar buzz, Foxx proved himself worthy of all the hype by portraying blind R&B; legend Ray Charles in a warts-and-all performance that Charles approved shortly before his death in June 2004. Despite a few dramatic embellishments of actual incidents (such as the suggestion that the accidental drowning of Charles's younger brother caused all the inner demons that Charles would battle into adulthood), the film does a remarkable job of summarizing Charles's strengths as a musical innovator and his weaknesses as a philandering heroin addict who recorded some of his best songs while flying high as a kite. Foxx seems to be channeling Charles himself, and as he did with the life of Ritchie Valens in La Bamba, director Taylor Hackford gets most of the period details absolutely right as he chronicles Ray's rise from \"chitlin circuit\" performer in the early '50s to his much-deserved elevation to legendary status as one of the all-time great musicians. Foxx expertly lip-syncs to Ray Charles' classic recordings, but you could swear he's the real deal in a film that honors Ray Charles without sanitizing his once-messy life.--Jeff ShannonMore on Ray CharlesModern Sounds in Country and Western Music(CD)The Genius of Ray Charles(CD)Ray Charles and Betty Carter--Dedicated to You(CD)Genius & Soul--The 50th Anniversary Collection(CD)Ray: A Tribute to the Movie, the Music, and the Man(book)More Albums by Ray Charles", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000E8QVWY", "B001P3SA94", "B00465I1CE", "B00005JKMQ", "6305428409", "B003BV8I3Q", "B00AEFXTKO", "B0002LE9HC", "B000BOH8X2", "B00AEFYG3S", "0790739313", "B000JJSL1W", "B000A50460", "B00005TQ44", "0783230524", "B0009R1TJ0", "0780627822", "B00AEFZ63M", "B000P0J092", "B002VWNICM", "B00EV4EUT8", "B000JLTRH2", "B000N6U0E2", "B0041QSZS8", "0783237367", "078324228X", "B00AEFY6TW", "B003HKN534", "B00BTYPWDQ", "B00G4Q3KOC", "B00007AJG1", "B00007L4KF", "B00ANDDBBY", "B000BITV9W", "0783114907", "B00007AJG2", "1558908390", "B00005JLRZ", "B000FVQLQQ", "6305692572", "0767821637", "B002CA68NO", "B00AFEXRME", "B002CPMB9O", "B004SIP93S", "B000063JDI", "B00005NB8K", "B00125WAWS", "6305505780", "B000IFRT4W", "B001TUZGPO", "B009NNM9OA", "B000RB6XG2", "B000P0J0CY", "B0001FR3IQ", "B000FVQLRA", "B00066FAVW", "B002XMGGK6", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00DW5IL2E", "B00005JPK8", "0767811070", "B000I0QL7I", "B000069I0E", "B00080ZG10", "0306814315", "B000P0J0EM", "B00AEFXP8K", "B00049QQHI", "B00000JGHV", "B0007CEXYK", "B0001Q4BOE", "B0000YEE6M", "B000NIVJF4", "B008Y1YJN6", "B00066VTU8", "B001132GNY", "B0006QAIG4", "B0034G4OSG", "B000C20VRS", "0800141741", "B00A2H9QN8", "B000Y11B8K", "B00005LB86", "B000056VP4", "B00005JL72", "B000095J01", "B000Q7ZNZ4", "B002CAWNEM", "B003UESJHO", "B00066FAQW", "0783230389", "B0013FDM7E", "B00007ELEO", "B00AMEZDJW", "B000P0J0CE", "B003Y5H4ZC", "0767821955", "B00003GPFT", "B0021L8V2A"], "bought_together": ["B000E8QVWY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0002LE9HC", "B000E8QVWY", "B000BOH8X2", "B00AZMFJYA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 17277}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.89, "brand": "Universal Studios", "asin": "B00005JND5", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41RQ8ETK19L._SX300_.jpg", "title": "Ray (Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "Batman Beginsdiscards the previous four films in the series and recasts the Caped Crusader as a fearsome avenging angel. That's good news, because the series, which had gotten off to a rousing start under Tim Burton, had gradually dissolved into self-parody by 1997'sBatman & Robin. As the title implies,Batman Beginstells the story anew, when Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) flees Western civilization following the murder of his parents. He is taken in by a mysterious instructor named Ducard (Liam Neeson in another mentor role) and urged to become a ninja in the League of Shadows, but he instead returns to his native Gotham City resolved to end the mob rule that is strangling it. But are there forces even more sinister at hand?Cowritten by the team of David S. Goyer (a veteran comic book writer) and director Christopher Nolan (Memento),Batman Beginsis a welcome return to the grim and gritty version of the Dark Knight, owing a great debt to the graphic novels that preceded it. It doesn't have the razzle dazzle, or the mass appeal, ofSpider-Man 2(though the Batmobile is cool), and retelling the origin means it starts slowly, like most \"first\" superhero movies. But it's certainly the best Bat-film since Burton's original, and one of the best superhero movies of its time. Bale cuts a good figure as Batman, intense and dangerous but with some of the lightheartedness Michael Keaton brought to the character. Michael Caine provides much of the film's humor as the family butler, Alfred, and as the love interest, Katie Holmes (Dawson's Creek) is surprisingly believable in her first adult role. Also featuring Gary Oldman as the young police officer Jim Gordon, Morgan Freeman as a Q-like gadgets expert, and Cillian Murphy as the vile Jonathan Crane.--David HoriuchiBatmanat Amazon.comAllBatmanDVDsBatman Begins101: A Comic Book PrimerWhere Have I Seen Christian Bale?AllBatmanComics and Graphic NovelsBatmanToysBatman BeginsSoundtrackStills fromBatman Begins(click for larger images)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001GZ6QC4", "B004LWZWGA", "B002GSXKN8", "B000P0J06U", "B001OST0LW", "B000P0J06K", "B004EPZ07K", "B00E5I2MCM", "B00005JKCH", "B001GCUO1Q", "B002ZG980U", "B001OST0M6", "B008JFUPFI", "B004LWZWFQ", "B00005JMQW", "B004LWZW42", "B000VI70QS", "B001DHXT20", "B000M341QE", "B0000959N0", "B000UR9T8C", "B00005JNTU", "B000AYELVA", "B00E5I2M6I", "B002IPFWTE", "B000HEVZ9E", "B0090SI56Y", "B002HWRYJE", "B0006L0LOS", "B000OVLBF8", "B00003CWT6", "B000VR0570", "B00E5I2MEK", "B000HCO83Q", "B0007P0Y7C", "B008JFUO72", "B00F4FFO8E", "B001CDR1FG", "B000P0J0EW", "B002T9H2LA", "B0002KVUKM", "B00E5I2M9K", "B00005N5S5", "B0083SBMBM", "B0001BKAEY", "B00AQSN7HE", "B000J10EQU", "B00005JKZY", "B002NXSRVG", "B000AYELVU", "B001OQCV6A", "B004LWZW4M", "B001VLBDD0", "B001GZ6QEC", "B004GJYRA0", "B007REV4T8", "B001TK80C0", "B000HRJLII", "B001QTXM5Y", "B005G4TJUC", "B00005JKZV", "B0053FANT0", "B00005JA8B", "B003YAR97K", "B004SIP9Z6", "B00001ZWUS", "B004EPYZQC", "B001N44BVQ", "B006VRRGNK", "B001AEF6HM", "B00000JQB5", "B00011CZRE", "B00AZMFJYA", "B00AEFY0F2", "B007K3JFUQ", "B0002IQMAM", "B00005JN0T", "B002SJIO4A", "B000VWYJ86", "B0013FDM7E", "B00005JNTI", "B00407PNY2", "B00DTPRZ24", "B008JFUS0U", "B00004Z4WR", "B000FS9FCG", "B000QXDED6", "B0085A9HU6", "0780624890", "B00005LOUK", "B000065U1N", "B000P0J0AG", "B00005JN5T", "B001QB9H1U", "B00005JMUA", "0792844890", "B0007DFJ0G", "B004EPYZSK", "B008JFUOWM", "B00AEFY5B6"], "bought_together": ["B001GZ6QC4", "B004LWZWGA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B009JBWOU0", "B001GZ6QC4", "B004LWZWGA", "B002ZG980U"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 7806}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.99, "brand": "DC Comics", "asin": "B00005JNJV", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518zjc4XtzL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Batman Begins (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "Despite super effects, a huge budget, and the cinematic pedigree of alien-happy Steven Spielberg, this take on H.G. Wells's novel is basically a horror film packaged as a sci-fi thrill ride. Instead of a mad slasher, however, Spielberg (along with writers Josh Friedman & David Koepp) utilizes aliens hell-bent on quickly destroying humanity, and the terrifying results that prey upon adult fears, especially in the post-9/11 world. The realistic results could be a new genre, the grim popcorn thriller; often you feel like you're watching Schindler's List more than Spielberg's other thrill-machine movies (Jaws,Jurassic Park). The film centers on Ray Ferrier, a divorced father (Tom Cruise, oh so comfortable) who witnesses one giant craft destroy his New Jersey town and soon is on the road with his teen son (Justin Chatwin) and preteen daughter (Dakota Fanning) in tow, trying to keep ahead of the invasion. The film is, of course, impeccably designed and produced by Spielberg's usual crew of A-class talent. The aliens are genuinely scary, even when the film--like the novel--spends a good chunk of time in a basement. Readers of the book (or viewers of the deft 1953 adaptation) will note the variation of whom and how the aliens come to Earth, which poses some logistical problems. The film opens and closes with narration from the novel read by Morgan Freeman, but Spielberg could have adapted Orson Welles's words from the famous Halloween Eve 1938 radio broadcast: \"We couldn't soap all your windows and steal all your garden gates by tomorrow night, so we did the best next thing: we annihilated the world.\"--Doug ThomasWar of the Worldsat Amazon.comThe SoundtrackThe War of the Worlds(1953)War of the Worlds - The Complete First Season(TV series)Classic Sci-Fi Movies and Their RemakesAliens Invade on DVDThe Prog-rock Opera (no kidding)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEBB8VK", "B00005JL78", "B001SGEUYW", "B00008G8M4", "B00005JL3T", "B0013FDM7E", "B00AEFXNLY", "B00005JMXX", "B001OQCV2E", "B000VECAD0", "B002O3Z510", "B0002V7OI8", "B000H30B2C", "B000EGDB10", "B00005JN2Z", "B005LAIIMG", "B005PTYP70", "B002O3Z50G", "B0002V7ON8", "B00005JN0T", "B00K2CHW48", "B002SJIO4A", "0783225547", "B008JFUO36", "B00005JKLZ", "B00AS1Q93S", "1936594056", "B004EPYZUS", "B001TUZG4K", "B00AEFXR1K", "B00001ZWUS", "B00AEFXYJA", "0767817478", "B0034G4ORC", "B003QO8TOQ", "B00070FX5U", "B0045HCJSA", "B00000G3PA", "B005LAIHPE", "B003Y5H5GK", "B00AEBBA72", "B00003CWU3", "B00I9TDMRM", "B001ECDVKE", "B00003CXXP", "B000V4UFZK", "B0010X73ZG", "B001DZOC6Y", "B00005JKFR", "B000XT1P4S", "B003HKN52U", "B0009PW4D2", "B000HRMAPE", "B004EPYZPS", "B0018QPPXW", "B0002WZTOI", "B00AEBB9LO", "B004LWZW4M", "B003ABZHAO", "B003YJFALS", "B0087ZG7HK", "B000OT6V64", "B004P7CN7W", "B000CCBC9O", "B00000ILDD", "0767803434", "B001L57ZYM", "B000065V3G", "B007STBUHI", "B002ZG980U", "B008JFUQZ2", "B00005B6JZ", "B0006GANOQ", "B000F1IQN2", "1494343576", "B001GCUO02", "B00004Y87O", "0783226810", "B004EPYZSK", "B000P0J0BU", "B005LAIHXQ", "B001680M26", "B000EQHXN2", "B0045HCJFS", "B00004BZIY", "B00008G8M5", "B00003CXQA", "B008JFUS0U", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00EIN6KJ0", "B0000DZ6N3", "B000MV8A9A", "B00005JKYX", "B0000YEEGM", "B000TGJ8CQ", "B0013FCWUW", "B002ZG9864", "B00003CWTI", "B008MIMWQW", "B00IKM5OCO"], "bought_together": ["B00AEBB8VK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AEBB8VK", "B004LWZW4M", "B00005JL78", "B004EPYZSK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 18739}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.95, "brand": "Dreamworks Skg", "asin": "B00005JNTI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51upxzPRnXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "War of the Worlds"}
{"description": "Opposites are forced to attract inAlong Came Polly, a dose of featherweight fluff that could've been better and could've been worse--surely no pairing of Ben Stiller and Jennifer Aniston can be a complete waste of time, right? Faint praise indeed, but fans of these mainstream funny-folk will enjoy this movie as a lazy-weekend distraction. Ben's a newlywed insurance risk-assessment analyst whose wife (Debra Messing, in a throwaway role) betrays him on their honeymoon. His uptight, play-it-safe lifestyle (which includes acute aversion to germs and irritable bowel syndrome) makes him seemingly incompatible with the spontaneous, free-spirited Polly (Aniston), but writer-director John Hamburg (whose writing credits include the previous Stiller hitsMeet the ParentsandZoolander) is determined to give them at least theappearanceof romantic potential.

{"description": "Along withDesperate Housewives,Lostwas one of the two breakout shows in the fall of 2004. Mixing suspense and action with a sci-fi twist, it began with a thrilling pilot episode in which a jetliner traveling from Australia to Los Angeles crashes, leaving 48 survivors on an unidentified island with no sign of civilization or hope of imminent rescue. That may sound likeGilligan's IslandmeetsSurvivor, butLostkept viewers tuning in every Wednesday night--and spending the rest of the week speculating on Web sites--with some irresistible hooks (not to mention the beautiful women). First, there's a huge ensemble cast of no fewer than 14 regular characters, and each episode fills in some of the back story on one of them. There's a doctor; an Iraqi soldier; a has-been rock star; a fugitive from justice; a self-absorbed young woman and her brother; a lottery winner; a father and son; a Korean couple; a pregnant woman; and others. Second, there's a host of unanswered questions: What is the mysterious beast that lurks in the jungle? Why do polar bears and wild boars live there? Why has a woman been transmitting an SOS message in French from somewhere on the island for the last 16 years? Why do impossible wishes seem to come true? Are they really on a physical island, or somewhere else? What is the significance of the recurring set of numbers? And will Kate ever give up her bad-boy fixation and hook up with Jack?Lostdid have some hiccups during the first season. Some plot threads were left dangling for weeks, and the \"oh, it didn't really happen\" card was played too often. But the strong writing and topnotch cast kept the show a cut above most network TV. The best-known actor at the time of the show's debut was Dominic Monaghan, fresh off his stint as Merry the Hobbit in Peter Jackson'sLord of the Ringsfilms. The rest of the cast is either unknowns or \"where I have I seen that face before\" supporting players, including Matthew Fox and Evangeline Lilly, who are the closest thing to leads. Other standouts include Naveen Andrews, Terry O'Quinn (who's made a nice career out of conspiracy-themed TV shows), Josh Holloway, Jorge Garcia, Yunjin Kim, Maggie Grace, and Emilie de Ravin, but there's really not a weak link in the cast. Co-created by J.J. Abrams (Alias),Lostleft enough unanswered questions after its first season to keep viewers riveted for a second season.--David HoriuchiWhere Have I Seen These Castaways?

The episodes are presented in widescreen format, just as they were broadcast on high-definition channels. (Conventional ABC-TV broadcasts were reduced to 1.33 full-screen format.) Four of the episodes have commentary tracks by the producing team and the actors who were featured on certain episodes (Terry O'Quinn, Dominic Monaghan, and Maggie Grace and Ian Sommerhalder). The last disc has over three hours of bonus material sensibly broken into three categories. \"Departure\" discusses the initial creation of the series, the making of the pilot, and the cast (some characters were created to fit the actors, and Evangeline Lilly's Kate was the hardest to cast). It also includes the cast's audition tapes and photographs by Matthew Fox. \"Tales from the Island\" provides background material on seven of the episodes plus the boars used in filming, Jimmy Kimmel's appearance on the set, and the genesis of the Driveshaft song (\"You all everybody...\"). Finally, \"Lost Revealed\" includes two scenes cut from the season finale, 13 other deleted scenes (not identified by episode, unfortunately), a blooper reel, and the cast and crew's giddy appearance at the Museum of Television & Radio.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000FIMG68", "B000P6YNSE", "B0018CWEYY", "B0019LY5IM", "B0036EH3XE", "B000ESSSK2", "B00G4SD75W", "B000QDLSR0", "B0018CWEZ8", "B001AQMBKA", "B000FKO3GW", "B0036EH3X4", "B000TFINY6", "B001B7CNZ6", "B002N5N5MK", "B002JVWRD6", "B0024FAD9C", "0756665949", "B00129W6LE", "B000BNI90Y", "1550227432", "1550228781", "1550227998", "B000YABIQ6", "1550229516", "1550228919", "B000AJJNFE", "B0009VBTP0", "B001AQMBJQ", "B0009A407A", "B000F3UAE8", "B000RO6JY0", "B0026RHR6U", "0615508294", "B001DJLCRC", "B0001O3YLM", "B001QE99AQ", "B003R0MEYA", "B003L77GJM", "B000FIMG5Y", "B00062IDEW", "1463548702", "B0038M2APA", "B0024FAR66", "B004TJ1GY2", "B002AMVED8", "B001MVWRNO", "B000I0QLR8", "B0000Y40PW", "B0024F08RO", "B000NDEXK2", "B001C4CI8U", "B00008YGRU", "B000FFJYC0", "B000N3T0EG", "B000EWBNMI", "B004LROMSO", "B00FFSTPDU", "B001HUWQEA", "B000GETTKM", "B00IWTVDUW", "B0024FAD9W", "B003L77GTC", "B002U0KHME", "B000FVQLIO", "B000W6ZUUC", "B0049P1VHS", "B009LDD4V4", "B0075FF5QM", "B0038M2AOG", "B000FOPPBA", "B001934SNM", "B0055SNHQG", "B00D2ZF24O", "B00079FUI6", "B0053O8A46", "B004YM6JK0", "B00B5ARKC0", "B00DII0MGI", "B00005JO9J", "B002BFBB0A", "B000AJJNI6", "B000Q6GUW0", "B002GOAH1A", "B00BHLTIXQ", "B008H6GHF6", "B003L77G2Y", "B00000FBH2", "B000FIMG4U", "B005S97V82", "B00CWIMVDW", "B000Q6GUKW", "B000P6YNSO", "B001GCUER0", "B001G0MFIS", "B0001HAGQK", "B001VPJYZK", "B001VPJYZ0", "0425188809", "B000BOH986"], "bought_together": ["B000FIMG68", "B000P6YNSE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000FIMG68", "B0036EH3XE", "B0018CWEYY", "B000P6YNSE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 5709}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 16.5, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B00005JNOG", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51nb5sJm%2B3L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Lost - The Complete First Season"}

{"description": "There seems to be no end to beating-the-odds football movies these days, and if they all peak with a breathless moment of anticipation during a clutch play, thenWe Are Marshall, based on a true story, has plenty of (mostly good) company. Matthew McConaughey plays Jack Lengyel, who becomes head coach--more or less by default--of Marshall University's rebuilding varsity football team in Huntington, W. Va., after the school's 37-member team and coaches (and a number of others) die in a plane crash in the Appalachian Mountains on Nov. 14, 1970. Facing an indifferent college president (David Strathairn) ready to shut the football program down, a morose assistant coach (Matthew Fox), and a charged-up player (Anthony Mackie) who missed the doomed flight due to an injury, Lengyel is faced with fielding a new team and putting the players through their paces. There are the usual, perhaps too-familiar, training montages and field action, but screenwriter Jamie Linden and director McG (Charlie's Angels) also draw some very good performances from the likes of Kate Mara and Ian McShane, contributing to an emotional tapestry conveying a powerful sense of how such a sizable loss affects a small community.--Tom KeoghOn the DVDIntroduced by director McG, \"Legendary Coaches\" (37 minutes) has real-life coach Jack Lengyel (portrayed in the film by Matthew McConaughey) recalling his time at Marshall and reading a letter he received from President Nixon.  Then five championship coaches discuss their coaching philosophies and overcoming adversity: Bobby Bowden (Florida State football, and also portrayed in the film as the 1971 coach at West Virginia), Pat Summit (Tennessee women's basketball), Lute Olsen (Arizona men's basketball), George Horton (Cal State Fullerton baseball), and John Wooden (UCLA men's basketball).

{"description": "This two-disc collector's edition ofPirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chestis packed with over five hours of special features that delve into everything from creating the mythology-inspired Davy Jones and Kraken figures, to working and planning without a completed script, the incredible CGI techniques used in the film, the intense sword training sessions and stunt work, and the unpredictability of filming on location in the Caribbean. The audio commentary by writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio is an interesting and insightful look into the finished film, but perhaps even more revealing is the 25-minute \"Charting the Return\" preproduction diary in which everyone from producer Jerry Bruckheimer to associate director Peter Kohn and writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio give a sense of the enormity of the project of concurrently writing and filming two sequels toPirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl. The overwhelming logistics of planning and casting without a finished script, scouting and preparing remote locations, constructing a new Black Pearl, and functional props like the rolling water wheel, and cutting costs to stay within budget are nothing less than mind-boggling. In the hourlong \"According to Plan\" feature, director Gore Verbinski, producer Jerry Bruckheimer, and a host of others detail the enormity of the project, focusing on the stamina involved in a 200-day shooting schedule and the need for adaptability and flexibility in dealing with everything from behind schedule excavations to the logistics of shooting on moving water and even the natural fury of a full-blown hurricane.  Shorter featurettes \"Meet Davy Jones: Anatomy of a Legend\" and \"Creating the Kraken\" focus on the mythological creatures in the film and the awesome visual effects and advances in CGI technology that made them possible.  \"Mastering the Blade\" follows Orlando Bloom (Will Turner), Keira Knightley (Elizabeth Swann), and Jack Davenport (Norrington) through some intense sword-fighting training sessions and \"Fly on the Set: The Bone Cage\" offers a frightening look at what it was like to shoot the bone cage scene of the movie.  Other bonus features include bloopers, an interactive tour of Johnny Depp's special makeup effects and wardrobe details, a look at how the 1967 Disney Land Pirates of the Caribbean ride was recently \"re-imagineered\" to incorporate some of the characters and elements from the new movies, producer Jerry Bruckheimer's photo diary, and a glimpse of the glitzy June 24, 2006 red carpet premiere on Disney Land's main street.--Tami Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000U7WV1Y", "B00005JM5E", "B005COPWZW", "B004A8ZWUQ", "B0013BM63O", "B00005JN5E", "B004M1A21K", "B004DTLK80", "B000VR0570", "B00005JKZV", "B00005JKZY", "B00005JKCH", "B001HN694K", "B00005JPH2", "B00AEFYGBA", "B00BEZTMFY", "B001HQZJMU", "B00E5I2M6I", "B006VRRGNK", "B001BEK8HO", "B000E8M0VA", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B001E75QH0", "B008QE9XD2", "B00E5I2MCM", "B00LG6YEKE", "B00AEBBA72", "B007K3JFUQ", "B000HRMAPE", "B0090SI56Y", "B000E6EK2Y", "B0053FANRC", "B00005JMQW", "B008Y1YK9Y", "B00177YA1K", "B001TK80C0", "B000UR9T8C", "B00003CXI1", "B004EPYZUS", "B00003CXTA", "B001OQCV6A", "B0014Z4ON4", "B005G4TJUC", "B000F7CECK", "B00HFFE8HE", "B001GCUO1Q", "B0087ZG7J8", "B003YAR97K", "B008JFUNTG", "B001GCUO0W", "B000NIBURQ", "B0053FANPY", "B00023B1LC", "B003QO8TOQ", "B002VPE1BQ", "B00F84H73Q", "B003Y5H54W", "B00003CWT6", "B00007AJGH", "B00E5I2M9K", "B000W7F5SS", "B0049IHX2C", "B00000IRE6", "B001F7MSFM", "B000AYELVA", "B002ZG9904", "B000VWYJ86", "B00CFA222M", "B003UYUQZW", "B008UZ949K", "B0002KVUKM", "B000209KMW", "B000UVKGPI", "B0087ZG7HK", "B0000WN140", "B001EZE5BU", "B002PMV9FG", "B000HT386M", "B000NQRR1Q", "B00003CXZ1", "630529142X", "B0002ZDVEU", "B004A8ZWSS", "B00005JM5B", "B000BTITKS", "B00E5I2MEK", "B002HWRYJE", "B001GZ6QC4", "B000W796OM", "B00AQSN7HE", "B0046BI81W", "B001VLBDD0", "B0060FXDCG", "B0084IG8TM", "B005OCFGTO", "B000OLGCIE", "B008JFUS0U", "B00007AJG4", "B009JBWOU0", "B001B3LIOC"], "bought_together": ["B000U7WV1Y", "B00005JM5E"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005COPWZW", "B00005JM5E", "B0071JADFU", "B00005JPFX"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 72898}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 16.95, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B00005JP0F", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GQE7TQ72L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)"}
{"description": "Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's Endis a rollicking voyage in the same spirit of the two earlierPiratesfilms, yet far darker in spots (and nearly three hours to boot). The action, largely revolving around a pirate alliance against the ruthless East India Trading Company, doesn't disappoint, though the violence is probably too harsh for young children. Through it all, the plucky cast (Keira Knightley, Orlando Bloom, Geoffrey Rush) are buffeted by battle, maelstroms, betrayal, treachery, a ferocious Caribbean weather goddess, and that gnarly voyage back from the world's end--but with their wit intact. As always, Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow tosses off great lines ; he chastises \"a woman scorned, like which hell hath no fury than!\" He insults an opponent with a string of epithets, ending in \"yeasty codpiece.\"!In the previousThe Curse of the Black Pearl, Sparrow was killed--sent to Davy Jones' Locker. In the opening scenes, the viewer sees that death has  not been kind to Sparrow--but that's not to say he hasn't found endless ways to amuse himself, cavorting with dozens of hallucinated versions of himself on the deck of the Black Pearl. But Sparrow is needed in this world, so a daring rescue brings him back. Keith Richards' much ballyhooed appearance as Jack's dad is little more than a cameo, though he does play a wistful guitar. But the action, as always, is more than satisfying, held together by Depp, who, outsmarting the far-better-armed British yet again, causes a bewigged commander to muse: \"Do you think he plans it all out, or just makes it up as he goes along?\" As far as fans are concerned, it matters not.--A.T. HurleyOn the DVDHere's something you can't say about just any DVD extras: There appears to bemoreof Keith Richards in the outtakes, interviews, and other special features on theAt World's Enddisc than in the actual film. For those scenes alone, this special edition is well worth the price. Richards looks as woozy and gamey as all the rumors suggested, and answers questions he's not asked, with Johnny Depp sitting next to him, almost acting as a translator. Richards offers pithy comments like, \"Everything I do is original, you better believe,\" and smiles when other cast members call him \"Two-Take Richards\" for supposedly nailing his scenes.The packed second disc also includes a terrific mini-doc on how the filmmakers created the famous maelstrom, in an enormous hanger in Palmdale, California, with the ships floating 30 feet off the ground. \"Just moving theBlack Pearlwas an enormous undertaking,\" says producer Jerry Bruckheimer with serious understatement. Other cool extras include \"Tale of the Many Jacks,\" deleted scenes with great commentary, \"The World of Chow Yun-Fat,\" a bio of composer Hans Zimmer, features on the set designers, a look at the impressive Brethren Court, and some hilarious bloopers. \"You can't curse in a Disney film,\" deadpans Depp when a costar blurts out something blue. \"See? I told him.\" The extras are truly as much of a rollicking adventure as the film.--A.T.

{"description": "Leonardo DiCaprio puts a handsome face on an ugly industry: In parts of Africa, diamond mining fuels civil warfare, killing thousands of innocents and drafting preteen children as vicious soldiers. DiCaprio (The Departed) plays Danny Archer, a white African soldier-turned-diamond-smuggler who gets wind of a large raw jewel found by Solomon Vandy, a native fisherman (Djimon Hounsou,In America) recently escaped from enslavement by a brutal rebel leader. Archer offers a deal: He'll help Vandy find his war-scattered family if Vandy will share the diamond with him. Drawn into this web of exploitation is journalist Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly,Little Children), who agrees to help if Archer will tell her the details of how conflict diamonds make their way into the hands of the corporations who sell them to the Western world. DiCaprio is compelling because he never flinches from Archer's utter ruthlessness; Archer ends up doing the morally justifiable thing, but only because his desperate greed has led him to it. Hounsou and Connelly, though saddled with all the moral and political speeches, rise above the cant and keep the movie's treacherously formulaic plot rooted in human characters. But in the end, the story won't stick with you as much as the dead stillness in the child soldiers' eyes; the horror of African civil strife refuses to be contained byBlood Diamond's uplifting message--and the movie is all the more potent as a result.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001N44BVQ", "B000M341QE", "B00005JLSB", "B00AEBB8NI", "B00080ZG10", "B004SIP7TE", "B006OFN0SE", "B002ZG980U", "B000NIVJF4", "B0007R4T3U", "B0016Q2D66", "B00049QQHI", "B001EZE5DI", "B00003CWM3", "B00008DP4C", "6305268827", "B000BYA5G4", "B00AEBB9F0", "B000Y7WGOW", "B004SIP7ZS", "B000065U1N", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B000095WW8", "B000U7169M", "B00DHHWXYY", "B000GFLKF8", "B004SIP8ZM", "B002O3Z510", "B002VWNIEA", "B002ZG99N6", "B0007DFJ0G", "B005LAIIJY", "0792839137", "B000KP62SE", "B000P0J0EW", "B000P0J09M", "B007SPPANM", "B00004XPPG", "B000C20VPA", "B00011CZRE", "B002QEHPQU", "B00005JN2Z", "B00AEBB9CS", "B00003CXWV", "B00AEFY5B6", "B00001ZWUS", "B00H9KKGTO", "B00005JN0W", "B002T9H2LA", "B000MTEFXC", "B003L20IG0", "B00AEBB86A", "B00005JKBC", "B0013XZ2QK", "B0000ACOXL", "B005LAIGRS", "B002AT8K9W", "B0007KIFGE", "B00AZNEW5G", "B003ASLJO0", "B000T28PII", "B002DU39GW", "B002ZG97RE", "B000LC55F2", "B00003CXTG", "B00AEBBA36", "B00B0U2SFE", "B003ASLJQI", "B002CPMB9O", "B00BB67UNW", "B000MXPE7O", "0783231202", "B000FVQLQQ", "B00AEFXVCU", "B00AEFXRRO", "B000A3XY5A", "B002JCSWV6", "B00005JNQA", "B004EPYZP8", "B0050MB4OO", "B000P0J0AG", "B000C65Z1G", "B00275EGWY", "B00005B6JZ", "B0006GANPA", "B00AEBB9NM", "B002XMGGK6", "B000C20VRS", "B0007P0XBO", "B003UESJME", "B000QXDED6", "B00AHTYI5M", "B001P9KR8U", "B004A8ZX28", "B008JFUNKU", "B003ASLJQS", "B002VWNICC", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00005BCKF", "B000NOIX48"], "bought_together": ["B000M341QE", "B002ZG980U"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AEBB8NI", "B00H9KKGTO", "B008MILL8W", "B000BYA5G4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 106777}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.96, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00005JPGO", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61MN8-6skUL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Blood Diamond (Two-Disc Special Edition)"}
{"description": "Special features abound on this two-disc special edition and there's something for every age. Adults will find the commentary track featuring Jerry Seinfeld and directors Simon Smith and Steven Hickner, co-writer Barry Marder, co-producer Christina Steinberg, and editor Nick Fletcher exceptionally interesting and funny; their dialogue covers movie trivia, technical challenges, descriptions of alternate and cut scenes, strange coincidences like running into and then casting Ray Liotta, and the scientific discovery of bee colony collapse during the time period of the movie's creation. Movie references to Seinfeld's favorite movieThe Graduate, and Seinfeld's musings as to appropriate autobiographical titles for his fellow filmmakers are also covered. A 15-minute \"Inside the Hive\" featurette talks about the cast of the film and details Seinfeld's efforts to recruit \"professional fun-havers\" and delves into how Seinfeld's consistent presence in the recording studio aided in the creation of a palpable rapport between the actors and a unique comic sensibility. A seven-minute exploration of the technology of the film with directors Simon Smith, Steve Hickner, and DreamWorks Animation CEO Ed Leonard speaks to the importance of Halo in allowing close collaboration between Jerry Seinfeld and the filmmakers despite geographical separation and of the vital technological partnership between DreamWorks, HP, and AMD. Three lost scenes and six alternate endings appeal to viewers of every age, as does the 16-minute \"TV Juniors\" segment which presents comic Seinfeld \"newscasts\" on every subject from DreamWorks open calls for movie ideas to sillyBee Movieknock-offs, gags about recruiting animators at border crossings and street corners, and even a discussion of futuristic movie formats like can openers and electric toothbrushes. \"Jerry's Flight Over Cannes\" announcesBee Movieto the motion-picture world as only Seinfeld can, and \"Meet Barry B.

{"description": "One of the first things a viewer notices aboutCloverfieldis that it doesn't play by ordinary storytelling rules, making this intriguing horror film as much a novelty as an event. Told from the vertiginous point-of-view of a camcorder-wielding group of friends,Cloverfieldbegins like a primetime television soap opera about young Manhattanites coping with changes in their personal lives. Rob (Michael Stahl-David) is leaving New York to take an executive job at a company in Japan. At his goodbye party in a crowded loft, Rob&#x92;s brother Jason (Mike Vogel) hands a camcorder to best friend Hud (T.J. Miller), who proceeds to tape the proceedings over old footage of Rob&#x92;s ex-girlfriend, Beth (Odette Yustman)--images shot during happy times in that now-defunct relationship. Naturally, Beth shows up at the party with a new beau, bumming Rob out completely. Just before one's eyes glaze over from all this heartbreaking stuff (captured by Hud, who's something of a doofus, in laughably shaky camerawork), the unexpected happens: New York is suddenly under attack from a Godzilla-like monster stomping through midtown and destroying everything and everybody in sight. Rob and company hit the streets, but rather than run with other evacuees, they head toward the center of the storm so that Rob can rescue an injured Beth. There are casualties along the way, but the journey into fear is fascinating and immediate if emotionally remote--a consequence of seeing these proceedings through the singular, subjective perspective of a camcorder and of a story that intentionally leaves major questions unanswered: Who or what is this monster? Where did it come from? The lack of a backstory, and spare views of the marauding creature, are clever ways by producer J.J. Abrams and director Matt Reeves to keep an audience focused exclusively on what&#x92;s on the screen.  But it also makesCloverfieldcuriously uninvolving. Ultimately,Cloverfield, with its spectacular effects brilliantly woven into a home-video look, is a celebration of infinite possibilities in this age of accessible, digital media.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B004EPYZQ2", "B00IO9D3ZI", "B00EMMDMKM", "B002SJIO5E", "B0044ZOI32", "B001AR0D4A", "B004BZ5AMS", "B001MVYUQQ", "B003BJO8KU", "B0018AG6X6", "B005LAIGPU", "B00IO8VMB6", "B000PKG8SS", "B003Y5H5GU", "B00BPA2PGG", "B0017U7PT6", "B001YV502C", "B0013FBS20", "B008JFUR10", "B001KZVQJI", "B001CW7ZW6", "B0035WTJFW", "B000Y7U98W", "B003ABZGRI", "B000VDDWEC", "B000VDDWEM", "B002JT69IM", "B00164EAC8", "B002ZG981E", "B00AEFXORM", "B001DZOC3W", "B008SAPC20", "B003Y5H59M", "B00HERVMTK", "B00AVSFIV2", "B0032KNA4I", "B000L212HW", "B001FB55I0", "B0018O4YSQ", "B002ZG997M", "B002ZG9788", "B008G33O0G", "B000VDDWE2", "B00K2CHVSK", "B001GCUO5W", "B005J4TLQG", "B000PC6A3E", "B0027VT9ES", "B001F7MSG6", "B0051T46XM", "B00111YM60", "B001GZ6QEC", "B002HR1W1K", "B004SIPA4G", "B001OQCVII", "B001JNNDBA", "B001GKJ2FC", "B000WQWPKA", "B000OT6V00", "B0021L8UXK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004EPYZQ2", "B00IO8VMB6", "B004LWZW4W", "B005LAIHY0"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "asin": "B00005JPXY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Wm5GO98oL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Cloverfield [Theatrical Release]"}

{"description": "You know you're going to get a different kind of superhero when you cast Robert Downey Jr. in the lead role. AndIron Manis different, in welcome ways. Cleverly updated from Marvel Comics' longstanding series,Iron Manputs billionaire industrialist Tony Stark (that's Downey) in the path of some Middle Eastern terrorists; in a brilliantly paced section, Stark invents an indestructible suit that allows him to escape. If the rest of the movie never quite hits that precise rhythm again, it nevertheless offers plenty of pleasure, as the renewed Stark swears off his past as a weapons manufacturer, develops his new Iron Man suit, and puzzles both his business partner (Jeff Bridges in great form) and executive assistant (Gwyneth Paltrow). Director Jon Favreau geeks out in fun ways with the hardware, but never lets it overpower the movie, and there's always a goofy one-liner or a slapstick pratfall around to break the tension. As for Downey, he doesn't get to jitterbug around too much in his improv way, but he brings enough of his unpredictable personality to keep the thing fresh. And listen up, hardcore Marvel mavens: even if you know the Stan Lee cameo is coming, you won't be able to guess it until it's on the screen. It all builds to a splendid final scene, with a concluding line delivery by Downey that just feels absolutely right.--Robert HortonStills fromIron Man(Click for larger image)&nbsp;", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00E5I2M6I", "B008JFUO72", "B001DHXT20", "B00E5I2M9K", "B00E5I2MEK", "B0083SBMBM", "B008JFUS0U", "B001CDR1FG", "B00E5I2MAO", "B004LWZWFQ", "B001GCUO1Q", "B008JFUPFI", "B000VI70QS", "B000HEVZ9E", "B0000959N0", "B00005JKCH", "B00005JNJV", "B00005JNTU", "B0090SI56Y", "B000VR0570", "B00005JMQW", "B002HWRYJE", "B0007P0Y7C", "B004LWZW42", "B00D7OMNXS", "B001OQCV6A", "B007K3JFUQ", "B004EPZ07K", "B004LWZWGA", "B000UR9T8C", "B0083SBJXS", "B0060FXDCG", "B002IPFWTE", "B00E5I2ME0", "B00IXD2MGQ", "B000AYELVA", "B00C6B8TB8", "B008QZ5PY2", "B000OVLBF8", "B000AYELVU", "B00AZMFJYA", "B001QB9H1U", "B009JBWOU0", "B001AK3S4Y", "B001GZ6QC4", "B005G4TJUC", "B002NXSRVG", "B000HCO83Q", "B003YOZNBU", "B003Q6D2B4", "B00023B1LC", "B0002IQMAM", "B008JFURII", "B00HERGM86", "B00E5I2MDQ", "B006VRRGNK", "B002ZG99QS", "B00000JQB5", "B007REV4T8", "B00008G8M5", "B008Y1YK9Y", "B0002ZDVEU", "6305718954", "B001DTPZNY", "B005LAIGW8", "B001F7MSFM", "B001GCUNWQ", "B00A2H9P98", "B000RW3VDE", "B002O5M4T4", "B00005JA8B", "B005LAIIPS", "B005LAII44", "B00BEIYHO2", "B000GUJZ00", "B00005N5S5", "B002SJIO4A", "B000VWYJ86", "B004EPZ0BG", "B0049IHX2C", "B00AEBBAEK", "B00005JM5E", "B008JFUOWM", "B000FS9FCG", "B00005PJ6N", "B00979KQFO", "B00AEFXKUI", "B002K0WBXW", "B0042U94UQ", "B004EPYZUS", "B008JFUQZ2", "B0084IG8TM", "B001DJLD1M", "B008JFUS5A", "B00006HBUJ", "B000J103OI", "B00F84H73Q", "B0087ZG7NO", "B000U1ZV8K"], "bought_together": ["B00E5I2M6I", "B008JFUO72"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B008JFUO72", "B00E5I2M6I", "B001DHXT20", "B00E5I2MEK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 12121}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.99, "brand": "DOWNEY,ROBERT JR.", "asin": "B00005JPS8", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515wjJQt2nL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Iron Man (Ultimate 2 Disc Edition)"}
{"description": "Here's hoping James Mangold's big, raucous, and ultrabloody remake of3:10 to Yumaleads some moviegoers to check outDelmer Daves's beautifully lean, half-century-old original. That classic Western spun a tale of captured outlaw Ben Wade (Glenn Ford)--deadly but disarmingly affable--and the small-time rancher and family man, Dan Evans (Van Heflin), desperate enough to accept the job of helping escort the badman to Yuma prison. Wade, knowing that his gang will be along at any moment to spring him, works at persuading the ultimately lone deputy to accept a bribe, turn his back on \"duty,\" and go home safe and rich to his family. That the outlaw has come to admire his captor intriguingly complicates the suspense.All of the above applies in the new3:10, but it takes a lot more huffing and puffing to get Wade (Russell Crowe this time) and Evans (Christian Bale) into position for the showdown. Mostly, more is less. To Mangold's credit, his movie doesn't traffic in facile irony or postmodern detachment; it aims to be a straight-up Western and deliver the excitement and charisma the genre's fans are starved for. But recognizing that contemporary viewers might be out of touch with the bedrock simplicity and strength of the genre--not to mention its code of honor--Mangold has supplied both Evans and Wade with a plethora of backstory and \"motivations.\" At the overblown action climax, the crossfire of personal agendas is almost as frenetic as the copious gunplay. (By that point the movie has killed more people than the Lincoln County War.)Best thing about the remake is Russell Crowe's Ben Wade, a Scripture-quoting career villain with an artist's eye and a curiously principled sense of whom and when to murder. As his second-in-command, Ben Foster fairly pirouettes at every opportunity to commit mayhem, and Peter Fonda contributes a fierce portrait of an old Wade adversary turned bounty hunter for the Pinkerton detective agency.--Richard T.

{"description": "Son of FrankensteinBasil Rathbone comes to Transylvania to inherit his father's estate in this second sequel toFrankenstein. The townspeople are suspicious, but young Frankenstein has no interest in reviving his father's work--until he discovers the monster hidden away in the castle, inert but very much intact and watched over by Ygor (Bela Lugosi), a sinister, snaggletoothed peasant with a broken neck. Convinced to revive the creature and vindicate his father's name, Frankenstein toils away in the lab not realizing that Ygor plans to use the monster to revenge himself on the jury that sentenced him to hang. Boris Karloff makes his final appearance as the Monster, now little more than a mute, lumbering robot under the hypnotic control of Ygor. Rathbone is a dignified, suave scientist and a marvelous match to Lugosi's mad Ygor, a richly malevolent performance that dominates the film. Lionel Atwill makes a marvelous addition to the Frankenstein gallery as the wooden-armed constable, a legacy of the monster's rampage 25 years before. (Mel Brooks's loving lampoonYoung Frankenstein, a veritable remake of this film, features the constable and his lumber limb in a major role.) Universal abandoned horror films in 1936, but the success of this sequel single-handedly revived the genre. Though lacking the gothic splendor and macabre humor of James Whale's originals, Rowland V. Lee's handsome production remains an intelligent, well-made classic of the genre and Universal's last great horror film. Lugosi returns as Ygor inThe Ghost of Frankenstein.The Ghost of FrankensteinThe monster lives! Again! Picking up whereSon of Frankensteinleft off, Bela Lugosi's gnarled Ygor survives yet another rampage by angry, torch-carrying villagers and frees the monster (The Wolf Manhimself, Lon Chaney Jr., taking over from Boris Karloff) from his sulfur grave. The latest cinematic Frankenstein scion, brain surgeon Ludwig (Cedric Hardwicke), wants to dissect the creature, but the ghost of his father convinces him to save it by giving it a new, \"good\" brain. Ygor has his own devious plan and enlists Ludwig's shady assistant (Lionel Atwill) in a brain-switching scheme.Ably directed by the pedestrian Erle C. Kenton,The Ghost of Frankensteingives up the gothic mood and moral quandaries of the original films for the busy, action-packed plots that defined Universal horror films of the 1940s. The human characters are all rather dull (except for Lugosi's animated, eye-rolling performance), and Chaney has none of Karloff's pathos or subtlety under the make-up, but the film opens with a spectacular bang as the villagers dynamite the castle, and skips from one inspired scene to another. The monster rejuvenates himself during an electrical storm with a jolt of lightning, mutely undergoes a courtroom cross-examination (by a ridiculously intent Ralph Bellamy), and finally goes on a blind rampage in the fiery climax. Frankenstein's monster returns (this time with Lugosi as the creature) inFrankenstein Meets the Wolf Man.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005LC4K", "B00005LC4J", "B00005LC4N", "B00005LC4M", "078323502X", "B00005LC4O", "B006TTC5J0", "B00000JMOF", "B0000694WM", "B00001TZ6Q", "B00000JQB7", "B00000F62P", "0783233582", "B00005NSXY", "B003M8NGG2", "B000035Z3K", "B0016586Q8", "B000WNHTCC", "B0009X770E", "0783240961", "B0001CNRLG", "B000FWHW8Q", "B000U1ZV7G", "B0007R4T26", "B00B94VJYW", "B00000ILEU", "B000FWHW90", "B001B9ZVVC", "B005D0RDKM", "0783240953", "B000EHQTZO", "B0009X770O", "B002945DUW", "B000FVQLKW", "B00005KHJP", "B000063UR0", "B00D9EJFZA", "B0000694WH", "B000A0GOEQ", "B00LC4PFOY", "B00005R1O7", "B00009NHC0", "B000A0GOFA", "B000UAFDR0", "B008FL8OTK", "B00D9EJFV4", "B0013XZ6SY", "B0002NRRQU", "B000EHSVJG", "B000A1INIA", "B005AMJ3B0", "B000062XEY", "B000UDGOBG", "B0001HAGTM", "B00009NHBC", "B000FOPPEC", "B0000AUHOK", "B005FQ2H0A", "B000GRUQJW", "B00HFWETZ8", "B0034PWPHY", "B00000K3U3", "B00009PY4D", "B00KTFJ50M", "B007Y1NNAW", "B00006G8K0", "B000VX9WB4", "B00AEBB8VK", "B005ETANC2", "B00DOZNGC2", "B00LC4PBTS", "B00HRUQ8X4", "B0001CNRNE", "B009KG7F30", "B00006G8JZ", "B0000AUHOO", "B00K1L4NBU", "B000095J42", "B000068TPF", "B00KTZALDC", "B000AQKU72", "B00009PY38", "B009AGEY98", "B0001CNRLQ", "B0007R4SZY", "B002TSAAS8", "B002DY9KQG", "B000RXVNDI", "B000QGEB1W", "B0002NRRRY", "B0016LFUVQ", "B00HRUQ7WG", "B0087ZG7RK", "B00DNUSFUG", "B0045HCJS0", "B002VEWMGS", "B005ETAN7C", "B00IE41A9O", "B000A0GOFK", "6305944288"], "bought_together": ["B00005LC4K", "B006TTC5J0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B006TTC5J0", "B00005LC4K", "B00005LC4N", "0783233582"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 19304}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.2, "brand": "UNI DIST CORP.

Veteran character actor Denholm Elliott stars as an unhappily married real estate agent in the grips of a recurring nightmare in \"Rude Awakening.\" As for rising stars, that's Pierce Brosnan in a blink-and-you'll-miss-it cameo as Last Victim in \"Carpathian Eagle,\" a story about a homicidal author who beds her victims. MoreNight GallerythanTwilight Zone, this series recalls Hammer's gory--I mean, glory--days as the premier producer of elegantly disreputable horror films that were a cross between Masterpiece Theatre and Herschell Gordon Lewis.

John Landis directed Murphy in his first film hit,Trading Places, and would seem a good match for this mix of action and comedy, but his sense of fun only emerges in a few scenes (chubby mechanics do a gymnastic Blues Brothers number to a Diana Ross tune) and his action direction is sloppy and shockingly violent.

Chas (Ben Stiller) started buying real estate in his early teens and seemed to have an almost preternatural understanding of international finance. Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow) was a playwright and received a Braverman Grant of $50,000 in the ninth grade. Richie (Luke Wilson) was a junior champion tennis player and won the U.S. Nationals three years in a row. Virtually all memory of the brilliance of the young Tenenbaums was subsequently erased by two decades of betrayal, failure, and disaster.

{"description": "From the director of Arlington Road comes a spine-tingling, super-natural thriller based on actual events that will rattle your nerves and shake your beliefs. Distraught by the sudden, tragic death of his wife (Debra Messing), John Klein (Richard Gere), a journalist for The Washington Post, finds himself mysteriously drawn to a small West Virginia town when his car inexplicably strands him. Rescued by the sympathetic but skeptical local police sergeant (Laura Linney), he soon learns that many of the town's residents have been beset by bizarre events, including sightings of an eerie \"moth-like\" entity, similar to the one seen by his late wife. Investigating further and having his own terrifying encounters with the creature, he becomes obsessed with the idea that this supernatural being canpredict impending calamities and is trying to warn the town of one. Is this a psychic delusion brought on by his grief or can he convince the police sergeant that there's a tragedy that must be averted", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JKZH", "B004BVS2C2", "0765334984", "B00AEBBA2W", "B003102JDC", "B00005JNNT", "B005FUTBSC", "B0002DB54A", "0765341972", "B004SIP92O", "B00ECW9UJY", "B00005JNY3", "B00AEFYC96", "B00L9K2EGS", "B00LBFFR2Y", "B00AEFYYH6", "B0013D8LCC", "6305310335", "B00005JL3T", "0966724674", "6305308837", "B00K2CHW48", "B003DQIPVO", "079074208X", "B000YNFXZA", "B009NZXH5S", "B0001Z52RU", "B00004BZIY", "B00006RCNY", "B00LG6XHDY", "B004B3PBFQ", "B000WMFZN8", "B0006IIKQW", "B0058ZPNUE", "B000TJ6PBK", "B00K2CHWYI", "B000068IEX", "1938398033", "0783240295", "0783116926", "B00BEIYMAG", "B000056T5E", "B00005RHGK", "B00064LJVE", "B005NKIPUY", "B0006HBZXS", "B00K2CHVSK", "B00008EY9G", "B001BRZ5J2", "B00006AUJR", "B000LP6KNU", "B002VWNICC", "6305213305", "6304883773", "B00AEFXW8I", "B0006SGYL0", "B004SIP6WW", "B000V4UFZK", "B000BTJDGC", "B003LR5BD0", "B00151QYOO", "B002AT8KAG", "B0007NFLO0", "0792835727", "B002GHHHN8", "0767817737", "0800177789", "B002O5M4T4", "B00BTYIHS8", "B0045HCJRQ", "B00000JGHL", "B00DZP1C2W", "B00015YVDG", "0792844807", "B00005O5AX", "6305657947", "630542845X", "B002LMSWN2", "B00005UWLB", "B00003L9CQ", "193839819X", "B004LWZW24", "6305718954", "B00BNAE14W", "B00B96TGQS", "0783226888", "B00008L3S6", "6304765258", "B00AEFY4IA", "B003UGLCIA", "B009XTF8KQ", "B004RA7Y9E", "B00AJLHUA8", "B001KMB6X2", "B000KWZ7JC", "B00111YM5Q", "B0050QNO7K", "B000U7169M", "B00AEFYXJ0"], "bought_together": ["B00005JKZH", "B00AEBBA2W"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005JKZH", "0765341972", "0765334984", "B004SIP92O"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 21120}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.0, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B0000648X0", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41l8S4jyEIL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Mothman Prophecies"}

{"description": "David Suchet brings the great detective Hercule Poirot to rich life in this collection of some of Agatha Christie's best work. This entertaining set includes three episodes, all lovingly true to their 1930s settings.The Disappearance of Mr. Davenhamtakes the standard case of a businessman's disappearance and spices it up with a friendly wager that Poirot can't solve the mystery without leaving his apartment.The Veiled Ladyis more of a comic caper, as Poirot and the ever-ready Captain Hastings (Hugh Fraser) resort to burglary to stop a blackmailing cad, andThe Lost Mineis cleverly set in a Chinatown reminiscent of the '30s concept of the Mysterious East. Suchet is a perfect Poirot, capturing both his dignity and his humor, and Fraser does a beautiful job of underplaying Hastings enough to keep him the perfect sidekick without ever making him boring. Special features include selected cast filmographies and biographies of Agatha Christie, David Suchet, and Poirot himself.--Ali Davis", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000068QJU", "B00007KK42", "B00008G8C1", "B0000V4726", "B00009PY1O", "B0028AENVC", "B007ISJS0U", "B00023P44M", "B005X5XINI", "B006JY3O2M", "B004WMOSNM", "B0001ZWY76", "B001V7YZA2", "B000CRR3EC", "B00GWXHYPI", "B001V7YZAM", "B006Z4LP9K", "B0000V472G", "B000068UE9", "B00D7AM2V0", "B001V7YZAC", "B00AEFYO5I", "B00068RYZK", "B0006212JK", "B001RPO3FU", "B0006HBJJ8", "B00A8KJLPM", "B004HJ0ZLE", "B0083HXKM2", "B00C12ZISE", "B005X5XI4C", "B000CRR36K", "B001RPPJSK", "B000056C0I", "B00005MM5H", "B00005QBZL", "B00GHH9I62", "B00DW5IKWK", "B002MUAXJY", "B001KP2J3U", "B0007Y3XRG", "B00AEFYCW8", "B004AE3QUS", "B009DS5OEM", "B0047CG95W", "B001RPWUTG", "B002FU8J10", "B00EF0NYVI", "B006X202AM", "B003AND1TG", "B001KZOVJK", "B00A27O5AW", "B004WCTLNY", "B001KP2J3K", "B000TRTV1S", "1569383626", "B0039ZF8E6", "B0045HCJ9E", "B00005RIWY", "B00005BGSC", "B00005RIX1", "B000HHE8F4", "B00005MM5G"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005X5XINI", "B008N8A3DA", "B004WMOSNM", "B005X5XI4C"]}, "price": 21.49, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 185569}, "asin": "B000068QJV", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GEGDS5SML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Agatha Christie's Poirot: Collector's Set Volume 1"}

{"description": "The new short film \"Scrat's Missing Adventure: Gone Nutty\" showcases the well-timed animation--strongly influenced by Chuck Jones's Road Runner-Wile E. Coyote shorts--that made that frantic little character so effective as a comic foil. It's interesting to compare the Oscar&#xAE;-winning short \"Bunny\" withIce Age. The viewer can see the Blue Sky artists developing the more angular and less detailed look that's become the studio's signature. Like Sid the Sloth, the title character in \"Bunny\" suggests a slightly frayed walk-around figure from a theme park; the texture of her coat anticipates the old-chenille-bathrobe look of Manny the Mammoth's pelt. The clips in different languages, trailers, directors' commentary, and making-of features feel rather standard, but listening to John Leguizamo experiment with different voices before settling on the exaggerated lisp for Sid offers an unusual and funny insight into the development of an animated character.--Charles Solomon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000GUJZ00", "B001GCUNWQ", "B005LAIISA", "B000MV9026", "B004HO6I4M", "B000AY74OG", "B001DPHDCY", "B002WJI2QQ", "B0006JMLRK", "B0012EM5D8", "B0000AOX0O", "B00CWM58WY", "B005QODEEE", "B0039N74CW", "B00005JNQS", "B00003CXJ4", "0783231474", "B001ECQ75A", "B00BG0RSJ4", "B0000640SC", "B001NCDFTW", "B004EPZ034", "B000M343BC", "B000RMJ4F8", "B0042U94UQ", "B00007LVCM", "B00AFEX83C", "B0000VV4W2", "B000UVKGPI", "B00005JMQZ", "B0013FSWT2", "B00G5G7EXY", "B008JFUQ16", "B002ZG97YM", "6305161887", "B0030IIZ4M", "B00005JNS0", "B0013FSL3E", "B005SDUV4E", "B00CHVJODE", "B00EBBGLFC", "B00EV1YZ96", "B001GCUO7A", "B005LAIHW2", "B00E9ZATJO", "B000056H26", "B00029LO0Y", "B000VBJEEG", "B006JD48LO", "B00F522C7C", "B005LAIH4A", "B003H9M1Q2", "B004G600A4", "B00005JM7T", "B005F96UJ6", "B00365F6I2", "B008YWY0HK", "B0030IIYYS", "B00JK531ES", "B00947N6D8", "B001OMU6UM", "B00GDT5T9Y", "B001ILFUD2", "B00000JL8E", "B000L22SG6", "B001GCUNW6", "B001KVZ6FW", "B00009YXAW", "B004LWZW7Y", "B001HN6918", "B003ZHVJGO", "B000065V42", "B00HLTD2OE", "B00275EHJG", "B00E00OGE2", "B00003CXB4", "B001HN6922", "B001U3D88M", "B002ZG9904", "B000H7JCK0", "B000AAF1TU", "B00005JMFH", "B001LPWGFA", "B008NNY9QW", "B009PPO78W", "B000LPS2VI", "B003E66Y84", "B00157OICI", "B003UESJF6", "B00003CXG7", "B001O5LVPI", "B000EQ5UHS", "B00028HBES", "B0000VCZKW", "B000ROAK2W", "B00ALMNCLQ", "B00I6JOD2S", "B000YERP2S", "B00CTNYLQA", "B00H5NY7NG"], "bought_together": ["B004HO6I4M"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004HO6I4M", "B005LAIISA", "B00IEXX4KS", "B000MV9026"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 126280}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 13.07, "brand": "20th Century Fox", "asin": "B00006CXHU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5150B79E6SL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Ice Age (2-Disc Special Edition)"}

{"description": "Men in BlackThis imaginative summer comedy from director Barry Sonnenfeld (Get Shorty) is a lot of fun, largely on the strength of Will Smith's engaging performance as the rookie partner of a secret agent (Tommy Lee Jones) assigned to keep tabs on Earth-dwelling extraterrestrials. There's lots of comedy to spare in this bright film, some of the funniest stuff found in the margins of the major action. (A scene with Smith's character being trounced in the distance by a huge alien while Jones questions a witness is a riot.) The inventiveness never lets up, and the cast--including Vincent D'Onofrio doing frighteningly convincing work as an alien occupying a decaying human--hold up their end splendidly.--Tom KeoghMen in Black IIMore remake than sequel,Men in Black IIsafely repeats everything that madeMen in Blackthe blockbuster hit of 1997. That's fine if you loved the original's fresh humor, weird aliens, and loopy ingenuity, but as sequels go, it's pure d&#xE9;j&#xE0; vu. Makeup wizard Rick Baker is the onlyMIBalumnus who's trying anything new, while director Barry Sonnenfeld and costars Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones (as alien-fighting agents Jay and Kay, respectively) are on autopilot with an uninspired screenplay. The quest of a multitentacled alien--on Earth in the form of Lara Flynn Boyle--for the light of Zartha requires Jay to deneuralize Kay, whose restored memory contains the key to saving the planet. The tissue-thin premise allows all varieties of special effects--mostly familiar, with some oddly hilarious new stuff tossed in for good measure. Certainly enjoyable as a popcorn distraction, but theMIBmagic has worn a bit thin.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B008Y1YK9Y", "B005LAIHQS", "B00008G8M4", "B000VG66XS", "B005COLETU", "B000U1ZV8K", "B006VRRGNK", "B0009RCPY8", "B008JFUS0U", "B00005JN0T", "B008JFUO72", "B00K7IPFSM", "B00003CXC5", "B00E5I2MCM", "B002GSXKNI", "B001DJLD1M", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B000Y11BC6", "B007WU7J6E", "B001B3LIOC", "B004LWZWFQ", "B0054OGQM8", "B0057RCFQS", "B0090SI56Y", "B000QUU4LY", "B00E5I2M6I", "B00000G3PA", "B000U1ZV62", "B005PTYP70", "B00070FX5U", "B00110WFVU", "B00005N5S5", "B003BV8ICM", "B008JFUPPI", "B001E75QH0", "B007WU5MWC", "B008M4C1EO", "B000MX7V70", "B00005JKCH", "B000056BSD", "B005LAII3A", "B00007AJG4", "B001VLFE7G", "B000HEVZ9E", "B00E5I2M9K", "B004LWZW42", "B0045HCJFS", "B00003CX5P", "B00008K76U", "B0064SVO9I", "B00AZMFJYA", "B000ASATYY", "B00IKM5LXG", "B001VLBDD0", "B00AEFY3MC", "B0013FDM7E", "B00E5I2MEK", "B001BYMX4A", "B00JK531ES", "B006TTC5PY", "B003Y5H5EW", "B0013J55B6", "B000NA1WE0", "B000JYW5B4", "6305428115", "B009MF5BXK", "B002GOAH1A", "B002GSXKN8", "B001DHXT20", "B002NZK5U0", "B0060FXDCG", "B00JL6L4UY", "B00005JN5E", "B001GCUO1Q", "B000QQLVPQ", "B003YAR97K", "B004EPYZUS", "B0087ZG7HK", "B002O3Z50G", "0783225733", "B008JFUO36", "B003Q6D2B4", "B008JFURII", "B001MVYUQG", "B000PHVZNE", "B00BEZTMFY", "B00005V1WW", "0800195175", "B001AGXEAG", "B000K405CY", "6305428263", "B000VI70QS", "B0006GANOQ", "B000MGBSE4", "B000QUCQX8", "B005COPWZW", "B002A5EBMQ", "B002GHHHME", "B00388PK7O", "B002GSXKOC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00177YA1K", "B0049IHX2C", "B008Y1YK9Y", "B00008G8M4"]}, "price": 34.64, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 69886}, "asin": "B00006JK1S", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DXPB6DE2L._SX300_.jpg", "title": "Men in Black (Deluxe Edition)/Men in Black II (Widescreen Special Edition)"}

{"description": "The third season of Joss Whedon'sBuffy the Vampire Slayerwas marked by the arrival in Sunnydale of renegade slayer Faith (Eliza Dushku), a moody loner who seemed to like her demon-staking calling just a littletoomuch. While Buffy (Sarah Michelle Gellar) was always wary of Faith, the two developed a deep friendship and appreciative rapport--that is, until the evil mayor of Sunnydale (Harry Groener) tapped into Faith's dark side and lured her into his plot to take over the world, first as a double agent spying on Buffy, then as out-and-out nemesis. And as the mayor's ascension approached--which happened to fall on Sunnydale High's graduation day--Buffy and Faith's battles got nastier and nastier, as Buffy attempted to wrestle with her dark side (literally and figuratively), save the world and her friends, and keep her lover Angel (David Boreanaz) out of Faith's evil clutches.Chock-full of exceptional episodes, this third season started out with a bang (the superb season opener \"Anne,\" in which a runaway Buffy finally returns to her Slayer calling) and never let up. Among other highlights, the season introduced former vengeance demon and soon-to-be regular Anya (Emma Caulfield), fleshed out Angel's tortured character (and readied him for his own series), and featured a hilarious doppelganger Willow (Alyson Hannigan), a vampire from a parallel universe, who in Willow's own words was \"evil and... skanky... and kinda gay!\" (Total foreshadowing there, folks.) The season's pi&#xE8;ce de r&#xE9;sistance, though, was the two-parter \"Graduation Day,\" wherein Faith tries to kill Angel, and the students of Sunnydale High prepare to do battle with a mutated mayor and his army of demons. Aside from the series' exceptional writing and acting, this compelling year ofBuffywas anchored by the consistently excellent Gellar, as well as Dushku's complicated Faith, a girl youtrulylove to hate. By the time you finish these episodes, Faith will have cast a spell on you that you'll find very hard to shake.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000EHSVLY", "B000EHSVL4", "B000EHSVM8", "B000EHSVKK", "B000EHSVMS", "B000EHSVN2", "B000I0QLQY", "B000I0QLR8", "B000I0QLRI", "B000I0QLRS", "B000I0QLS2", "B007H9CNOI", "B0006IUE16", "B000HD1482", "B0009W5J4Q", "B000B5XOW0", "B000CCBCGM", "B000ERVJM2", "B000GG4Y6O", "B000JLTRIG", "B000OIOPHC", "B003YF9Q08", "B00344EAQO", "B0000AQS0F", "1593078226", "B00466H3CW", "B005CM1IIE", "B00005JLKB", "1595821651", "B002JVWR4U", "B00JF5G8WU", "B006LG74Q0", "B0024FAR66", "B0001JXPPC", "B00J2T1856", "B00022FWEU", "B00006J3WH", "B0009JE6FC", "B00IKM5LXG", "B00001R3O1", "B000069I1I", "B000CNE0SS", "B000BNI90Y", "B001JAHRME", "1595826106", "B00AMDA2QC", "1442412097", "1595825584", "B00005Y1NF", "159307963X", "B0012Z36F8", "B000X5SPBI", "B003L77GAQ", "B000CNE0TC", "B00133QNS6", "B000EBGFPY", "B001FB4W0C", "B002U8XW9Q", "B001QE99AQ", "B000N6SE4U", "B003R4ZMN6", "0789326302", "B000BOH986", "B009LDCXNY", "B001M5UDGS", "1442412119", "B0018RKEQY", "B000NOKFH6", "B00511N79O", "B002BWP2IK", "B000MX7V66", "B000062XFG", "B00006FD9N", "B00JF5GAZA", "B00133QNSG", "B009LDCWWG", "B00133QNRW", "B000E5KQM8", "B000F3UAE8", "B000FL7CAK", "B000B8QFYG", "B003L77GWE", "B00EIL7E9C", "B00B1RB7TO", "B00191AEYQ", "B0030Y12AA", "B0011FLGZQ", "B000AJJNI6", "B001ILFUA0", "B001MVWRNE", "B000095ZGW", "B000RW3YYA", "B00K0D9760", "B00HEQOAIQ", "B000NA28I4", "B000LC4ZI0", "B000BOH98G", "B000AJJNFE", "B000O77SN6", "B00005JLYW"], "bought_together": ["B000EHSVLY", "B000EHSVM8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000EHSVL4", "B000EHSVKK", "B0046XG48O", "B000EHSVLY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 154783}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 32.59, "brand": "20th Century Fox", "asin": "B00006RCNX", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RSRJ6FCWL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Buffy the Vampire Slayer - The Complete Third Season"}
{"description": "From the director of Fatal Attraction comes \"a steamy thriller\" (People Magazine) about physical passion so intense, it consumes everything - and everyone - in its path.

{"description": "Dirk Bogarde risked his career to make this 1962 film about a lawyer who risks his career to stand up to blackmailers. Part crime thriller and part plea for tolerance,Victimuses the terror of a blackmailing ring to point out the injustice of Britain's antisodomy laws. Bogarde plays Melville Farr, a married lawyer who learns of a blackmail scheme when one of its victims, an old friend, commits suicide rather than tell the police. As Farr conducts an investigation, he must confront his own past.Victimwas ahead of its time--it was the first English-language movie to use the word \"homosexual\"--and as such it seems quaint and stilted at times. Straw-man clich&#xE9;s about homosexuality must be knocked down, and, like in all first-wave issue movies, occasionally characters need to have rather stilted debates. Still, the crime plot stands on its own, the performances are excellent, and the film is brave enough to make some very good points.

{"description": "Alan Bates gives a fierce, uncompromising performance inThe Mayor of  Casterbridge, a skillful  miniseries adapted from Thomas Hardy'sclassic novel. The arrogant Michael Henchard (Bates), in a foul drunken  mood, sells his long-suffering wife Susan (Anne Stallybrass) and infant  daughter Elizabeth-Jane to a sailor at a country fair. Henchard awakens  the next morning stricken with remorse; he vows not to drink again  for 21 years. Eighteen years later, Susan returns to find him,  with Elizabeth-Jane (Janet Maw) in tow; Henchard receives her joyously,  eager to lay the rash acts of his youth behind him, but just as eager to  avoid the shame that his past might bring to his current life as mayor of  the town of Casterbridge. Thus begins a complex and compelling tragedy of  secrets, betrayals, and unexpected turns. In the hands of Dickens, this  melodramatic story would have been a romp. Hardy has a sadder but also  more intensely emotional bent; he takes his characters' feelings--both  their loss and their desire--deeply seriously, and the result is as  passionate as it is woeful.The Mayor of Casterbridgestarts  sluggishly, but becomes increasingly gripping over the course of seven  episodes, as the excellent cast makes the characters vivid and  sympathetic. Bates and Anna Massey, as a former love of Henchard's who  seeks to renew their relationship, are particularly superb. Some critics  view Henchard's fall from grace as the result of pride; but this  production, written with nuance and care by Dennis Potter (The Singing  Detective,Pennies from Heaven), makes clear his emotional clumsiness and how it sabotages his  fumbling after happiness.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000AQS3P", "B001B4VXWS", "B007A2O3FO", "B005T0OY5S", "B000EBD9VC", "B0000639G5", "B001PJRAUS", "B004H0ZHD4", "B004JMSIQS", "B000089QEM", "B0009PVZM8", "B00005JOA0", "B0009PVZL4", "B000784WNQ", "B000FSLMFE", "B000KGGJ1I", "B000FQIRY0", "B001D8W7EU", "B000228SWS", "B006OFN0PC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0000AQS3P", "B000089QEM", "B005T0OY5S", "B00005JOA0"]}, "price": 11.58, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 261864}, "asin": "B00007KE37", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5180DMR525L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Mayor of Casterbridge"}

{"description": "Deep Space Nine's sixth season began ambitiously with a six-part story arc devoted to the Dominion War. This was a brave move in many ways, but a sensible one too. Whereas other sci-fi shows wouldn't commit to showing the impact of war (e.g.,Babylon 5), here there were numerous visible sacrifices. Characters were frequently kidnapped and held prisoner, allowing screen time for other members of the ever-growing cast (at its peak there were as many as 18 individuals with speaking roles per episode). This year also introduced the idea of Starfleet Intelligence and its sinister Section 31; alliances were built only to crumble almost immediately; Sisko led a suicide mission and at long last his destiny as the Emissary took a serious turn.Amid all thissturm und drangthe writers felt it necessary to inject some levity. In fact, there was so much comedic sidetracking this year it actually seemed as if they were afraid of the series' dark tone. Witness: Quark undergoing a temporary sex change, leading aMagnificent Seven-style band of Ferengi (with a cameo from Iggy Pop), Morn's nonspeaking character being sorely missed, the blend of Troi and Guinan into '60s crooner Vic Fontaine, and, in one fan favorite episode (\"Far Beyond the Stars\"), Sisko having visions of himself and the crew as 1950s staff writers on pulp magazineIncredible Tales.  There were also cute reconciliations among Worf's extended family (leading toTrek's first cast wedding), and even the revelation of Bashir's genetically enhanced origins quickly became a subject for easy jokes.Any of these events would have been satisfactorily cute if the war had ended and the show had moved on. But it confused the viewer when every so often the battle would be rejoined mid-episode. The clinching proof that no grand design was really at work was in the sudden exit of Dax. Despite all the jarring humor scattered about after the strong opening, the show seemed unable to avoid reverting to shock tactics for its finale. All of which hardly made the promised final year seem a particularly enticing prospect.--Paul Tonks", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00008KA57", "B00008KA59", "B00008KGT0", "B00008KA5A", "B00008972H", "B00005JLF5", "B00062IDCO", "B00062IDLA", "B0002JP4GE", "B0002WZTCA", "B000127LW2", "B0001NBNFW", "B000228EBS", "B000AOEMXC", "B0009I7NGW", "B000A6CLL0", "B0007TKH66", "B00BHWG0CM", "B00BHWG0DQ", "B000063V8T", "B000063V8S", "B000063V8R", "B000062XFG", "B00KHA9BQ2", "B00062IDDS", "B00005Y1NF", "B002BAW6FE", "B00KYCA4QY", "B00000JZ0Z", "B002BAW6FY", "B002BAW6H2", "B00HETWFVC", "B000HEWEJ4", "B000VDDDY6", "B002BAW6GS", "B001DHXT3Y", "B002BAW6GI", "B000AOEMXM", "B00IURL19Y", "B004EXWGHY", "B00IWTVDUW", "B00IO998U2", "B00JX3SHIC", "B002I9Z8GW", "B00B7VZN76", "B0017VG69U", "145169590X", "B000LC4ZI0", "B00CDEJRDC", "B0041B77RS", "B00BD6K54G", "B00GTZWZH6", "B00AZMFJYA", "B002I9Z8EO", "B002I9Z8GM", "B00CKYHH6O", "B00FFEM0W2", "B000CEXFYW", "B003Y7JWZ0", "B001DHXT6G", "B0095XPZBC", "B000I0QLR8", "B006LPHY6G", "B0006UEVTA", "B00C6ACWLC", "B000I0QLRI", "B009VYF5E2", "B000B8IA2G", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B008R52LA2", "B000I0QLRS", "B000F8O2PQ", "B005PPMHO2", "B000BOH990", "B00BHLTIXQ", "B002GP7ZVO", "B003H9LIRK", "B001DF681G", "B00C6ACUF0", "B00GX7D5G0", "B0007UDCX0", "B00CYQXHLC", "B000FEBWTY", "B00BHWG1AI", "B00AMDA2P8", "6305181721", "B00IUR3YI0", "B004HYW84G", "B0055OG2BC", "B00ENFS0F0", "B000E5KQM8", "B000W4KT9G", "B00CTSDDVO", "B00466H3A4", "B000BOH98G", "B00453QOC6", "B000I0QLS2", "B000CNE0T2", "1451607156", "B000I0QLQY"], "bought_together": ["B00008KA57", "B00008KA59"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00008KA57", "B00008KA59", "B00008KA5A", "B00008KGT0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 20268}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 34.93, "brand": "Paramount", "asin": "B00008KA58", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51oKmE4qlyL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Star Trek Deep Space Nine - The Complete Sixth Season"}
{"description": "Deep Space Nine's seventh and final season came down to loose ends, tying some existing ones together while allowing others to unravel. Symptomatic of the unwillingness to letDS9go was the immediate arrival of a replacement Dax, though poor Nichole deBoer as Ezri Dax had to have known she'd already missed the boat. Her appearance encouraged last-minute romances to blossom, with Bashir finally getting some action, Odo finally getting together with Kira, and Sisko finally proposing to Kassidy. Another contributing cute factor were numerous trips to the holosuite wherein the all-knowing Vic Fontaine dished out philosophical advice. That was when the crew wasn't in there to play baseball against the Vulcans, or when Nog wasn't commiserating about the loss of a leg.Oh yes, and don't forget the War! There was an early announcement that the show would attempt a 10-part resolution to the Dominion War, but viewers could be forgiven for forgetting all about it with so much sentimental distraction. When the horrors of war did resurface, they at least injected a few surprises into the mix. Odo and his ambiguously \"evil\" Founders were hit with a melting disease, prompting a backstabbing race for the power of developing and owning a cure. The original baddie Cardassians finally settled on the Federation's side. Contrary to these interesting twists, however, were the unexpected turns taken by matters relating to Sisko's spiritual destiny. Suddenly the mystery of the wormhole and an entire religious belief system was reduced to the problem of correctly translating the words of a sacred book. The struggle to join with some evil aliens significantly diluted the attempt at resolving what had begun seven years before in the show's pilot episode. Ultimately, Sisko's destiny, as with all those who'd followed him to the open-ended climax, was to be decided elsewhere. In a move that was either bold and daring--or possibly born of desperation for not having thought things through properly--the show's storylines were to be continued in a series ofspin-off books.--Paul Tonks", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00008KA58", "B00008KA59", "B00008KGT0", "B00008KA5A", "B00008972H", "B00005JLF5", "B00062IDCO", "B0002WZTCA", "B00062IDLA", "B0002JP4GE", "B0001NBNFW", "B000127LW2", "B000228EBS", "B000AOEMXC", "B0009I7NGW", "B000A6CLL0", "B0007TKH66", "B00BHWG0CM", "B00BHWG0DQ", "B000063V8T", "B000063V8S", "B000063V8R", "B00KHA9BQ2", "B000062XFG", "B004EXWGHY", "B002BAW6FE", "B00005Y1NF", "B00HETWFVC", "B003H9LIRK", "B002BAW6GS", "B001DHXT3Y", "B00062IDDS", "B000AOEMXM", "B002L9N4E2", "B00000JZ0Z", "B000I0QLRS", "B000CEXFYW", "B00IWTVDUW", "B000I0QLR8", "B000I0QLRI", "B00BHWG0G8", "B00AZMFJYA", "B00IURL19Y", "B002BAW6FY", "B000VDDDY6", "B006LPHY6G", "B0017VG69U", "B00061QJSK", "B000HEWEJ4", "B00BHWG1AI", "B000PHX8RA", "B00B7VZN76", "B000LC4ZI0", "B002BAW6GI", "B002BAW6H2", "B000I0QLQY", "B002HQKRBC", "B000I0QLS2", "B003ZFC9M4", "B00K7IPGS6", "B000092T3Y", "B001RHGRTS", "B00IF0KASY", "B00IO998U2", "B004TJ1H3C", "1451607156", "B001DF681G", "B002GP7ZVO", "B00FFEM0W2", "B00CKYHH6O", "B008R52LA2", "B00ENFS0F0", "B000BCCAEQ", "B000B8IA2G", "B000B5XOTS", "B000BNI90Y", "B002I9Z8GW", "B007AFC0W4", "B001DHXT6G", "B00GTZWZH6", "B00CDEJRDC", "B00CYQXHLC", "B00JPS6A3O", "B000E5KQM8", "B00AMDA2P8", "B002I9Z8GM", "B005GYXO30", "B00CTSDDVO", "B006LG74RE", "B0055OG2BC", "B00GX7D5G0", "B002GP7ZV4", "B0095XPZBC", "B0006FO9B0", "B0000AUHOH", "B000PMFRTC", "B001O0TWY0", "B0048FUUAI", "B00GZP0JSC", "B00000ILBK"], "bought_together": ["B00008KA58", "B00008KA59"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00008KA58", "B00008KGT0", "B00005JLF5", "B00008KA5A"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 20323}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 35.41, "brand": "Paramount Home Video", "asin": "B00008KA57", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515jKg5Op4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Star Trek Deep Space Nine - The Complete Seventh Season"}

Kyra Sedgwick voices Batwoman, whose struggle to bring down the Penguin's illegal arms trade gets her in hot water with his hired muscle, Bane (Hector Elizondo), and prompts Batman (Kevin Conroy) to swing into action. Curt Geda's fast-paced, noir-influenced direction, a solid script by Michael Reaves that stays true to the comic book mythos, and a talented voice cast (which includes Kelly Ripa and David Ogden Stiers) help makeBatwomana welcome addition to the Batman DVD library. The Warner DVD's 45 minutes of extras include an original short (\"Chase Me\"), nine character bios, behind-the-scenes footage, an interview with Geda, and other audience-pleasing supplements.--Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000A9QKL4", "B000A9QKLE", "B0009UZG28", "B000YDBP84", "B000A59PLU", "B000B7QCHC", "B00005Y71G", "B000F0V0LS", "B003ITZBVS", "B001614E68", "B0007XG43W", "B0002ZMHWM", "B000GYI336", "B000LE1798", "B002YOKVUY", "B005SH63HO", "B002FGUHBE", "B000PFSYO4", "B005CSYQ2S", "B000CSTK42", "B003UN2ICM", "B002JUFPXG", "B00023E894", "B001LK8SQ6", "B004QOB8PW", "B003Z8ZCDO", "B000F4RH8E", "B004L9GM3A", "B000PE0G0A", "B000FZETS4", "B007MCUAD6", "B00280LZBI", "B00A2LFXVI", "B000B7QCGS", "B004EE2ZY2", "B0002ZMHX6", "B00BBAQD6S", "B000LE17A2", "B0016OM3WC", "B000UPMZ1M", "B0089AD8J8", "B000M2E32W", "B000CEXFZ6", "B000GYI33Q", "B00CENSU1W", "B002LWJ510", "B008RV5K4U", "B003L7DK88", "B00GD9GNEY", "B00GZ0ML2Y", "B0001A7V1U", "B000F4RH8O", "B003XMZVHY", "B00I40K6RU", "B00005Y71H", "B0089TQ70Q", "B000CSTK3S", "B00GJ6HQDI", "B00GZ0ML4C", "B00CPEK3NI", "B002JUFPWW", "B00J8LXD60", "B00DP9MDE4", "B00GD9GNUS", "B007RG8ZF2", "B006PA0WF2", "B00005Y71J", "B00HMOW9YM", "B009OAWMK8", "B002997SKK", "B00BACT1I4", "B000B7QCHM", "B00HXH00YE", "B0058YPN4G", "B001614FX0", "B004AUCDK6", "B005SH6482", "B0000X2ECY", "B000JLTR86", "B000OPODNG", "B00BTJV9RO", "B003ITZBVI", "B000SMNL92", "B004XKVRBE", "B007KW5MOU", "B002JUFPXQ", "B00CENWUYK", "B003M8NGLC", "B003Z8ZCD4", "B0006U3SJO", "B004PHE9FQ", "B00D97DLYS", "B004RBC5LA", "B00KH57U60", "B0081BEZXS", "B000R5OFOA", "B000TSTEJG", "B000096IBN", "B0007US7CQ", "B000087F7H"], "bought_together": ["B000A9QKL4", "B000A9QKLE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0009UZG28", "B003ITZBVS", "B000A9QKLE", "B000A9QKL4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 137435}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 4.54, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B0000AQS7M", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518ZHKPGDFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Batman: The Mystery of the Batwoman"}

{"description": "When Cousin Eddie joined Clark Griswold and his family for National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation, the movie quickly becaume a holiday institution. An institution, of course, is where many think Cousin Eddie should reside. Randy Quaid again plays crude but lovable Eddie and Miriam Flynn returns as his wife in another comic skid on the Vacation banana peel. In a way, Christmas has always been a test of survival for Eddie and his brood. And that's truer than ever when they receive an expenses-paid holiday tour of the South Pacific and end up shipwrecked on a remote island. Fred Willard, Ed Asner, Eric Idle in a zany cameo and more join in this season of comfort and joy. Which means little comfort for Eddie. And lots of joy for Vacation fans.DVD Features:OuttakesTheatrical Trailer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001U3ZYWU", "B000VBIGD6", "B0000AVH9Q", "B00407PNZ6", "B008VPBZZ0", "B005COLF3A", "B00407PO3W", "B000UX798I", "B00CP1ZRKU", "B0002XVKM2", "B000KJT8IG", "B000VBIGCW", "B001CW8016", "B00005BJX6", "B0007A0F4E", "0790740044", "B000G1R4RA", "B000TJBN6W", "B000068MBV", "B00AEBB9E6", "B001CTA1UM", "B003VK8Q20", "B003OFTPFO", "B00ECGIL9K", "B008VPBZXW", "B00FZ570V2", "B000YABV7W", "B005GHBKD8", "B00A1B9UD6", "0790742012", "B00BCAWA6Y", "B000MTFDBU", "B00941T2HS", "B000GB5M4C", "B0071HPOHY", "B00IKM5OCO", "B000065U1D", "B003CRM6PA", "B00DDCQNM6", "B00AEFYDM2", "B002GSXKPG", "6305609764", "B00F40UBM8", "B008R65XKQ", "B006TTC5GS", "B003IVXR7Q", "B00319ECBK", "B003IVXRA8", "B000VAHQVU", "B001DDBD5E", "B00441GYQ0", "B001DPHDBA", "B0019HQICW", "B004XMPRJA", "B005QX8UEE", "B00BEIYMZ6", "B002O3Z4YI", "B001SXZ7T2", "0783227884", "B000BVM1QY", "B0014VPFV8", "B0004Z33EQ", "B0004Z33F0", "B00443FN1K", "B009N6AMU0", "B000641D2Y", "B00K7PB4QM", "B00AEFYVMO", "6305428263", "B00005V5NS", "B00003CXKD", "B0090SI53C", "B00008N6NQ", "B004SEUJO6", "B00005N7Z0", "B004RQDXU2", "0792844831", "B005GP7EYE", "B00HEEAMJO", "B0001XAQ9Q", "B00005LOUP", "B0009UC810", "B004047XWU", "B00BUAEYVK", "B00007JMDW", "B000PKG6G2", "B008HSEPCG", "B0000A02TZ", "B00AN8H5E8", "B001CW7ZZ8", "B0002F6BRE", "B000U1ZV8K", "0767821467", "B000068TR1", "B002JUFPUE", "B003NFM3JK", "B004DTLKCG", "B000803BQC", "0783225539"], "bought_together": ["B001U3ZYWU"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001U3ZYWU", "B000VBIGD6", "B005COLF3A", "B0000AVH9Q"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 37432}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.88, "brand": "Warner Brothers", "asin": "B0000DZ3IE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ecPw3%2BoyL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation 2 - Cousin Eddie's Island Adventure"}
{"description": "The second season ofDawson's Creekfinds Dawson (James Van Der Beek) and Joey (Katie Holmes) exploring the newest phase of their lifelong friendship, leaving Jen (Michelle Williams) and Pacey (Joshua Jackson) on the outside.  The former enters a downward spiral assisted by bad girl Abby (Monica Keena), but Pacey happens into a \"meet cute\" with one of Capeside's new residents, the impossibly perky Andie (Meredith Monroe), who turns out to be his perfect foil. TheCreekalso struck gold with its second major addition, Andie's brother Jack (Kerr Smith), who shows Joey that he's more than just a clumsy waiter.  With the siblings' help, Pacey and Joey show the most personal growth during the season's 22 episodes.  The constant parent-child crises can be a bit much, but there were numerous other developments, including a two-part sexual whodunnit, Dawson embarking on his second movie (assisted by Rachael Leigh Cook in a sizzling guest appearance), Dawson's birthday party from hell, a vicious rumor that spreads through the high school, and the emotion-wringing finale.The only bonus feature is a commentary track on the first and last episodes just as withthe first season, though executive producer Paul Stupin is by himself rather than accompanied by creator Kevin Williamson.  The interplay is missed, but Stupin enthusiastically offers a lot of information about how the cast had become celebrities by the second season and had to juggle other projects, and random details and trivia.  Stupin mentions how carefully he selected different pieces ofmusic, which \"would become forever part of our show.\"  That's ironic because for this DVD set Stupin himself picked a lot of new music to replace the selections that originally aired, presumably because of the cost involved in securing the rights (a problem for many television DVD releases).  A couple of episodes are unaltered, but others have had almost every song replaced.  Newcomers to the series probably won't notice, but serious fans may want not want to tape over their VHS cassettes just yet.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00008AOX3", "B0002234R2", "B0002RQ3MK", "B0007V6IW6", "B000EAT23C", "B0000AUHQ9", "B0001IN0T4", "B0006FFRBG", "B000NA1PUG", "B002BAW6HW", "B002BAW6I6", "B000BNXD6O", "B0012BS5XU", "B000MEYJII", "B0009K7QZ8", "B000GYI32M", "B0077PTWY6", "B0012GN23S", "B00133QNRW", "B001EWDXT8", "B002JVWRB8", "B0077PTWHI", "B00127RAGM", "B0050MB5P2", "B0002V7TZQ", "B00133QNS6", "B00079FUI6", "B0001CCXZW", "B00BGQ2NIO", "B000FUTVPA", "B000H7JCG4", "B000C8STWQ", "B002BJGYU8", "B000MGBSHQ", "B003R0MF7G", "B0006J28DM", "B004GJYRFA", "B00DDHFKMA", "B000U1ZV2G", "B00133QNSG", "B005FISC52", "B00005JO9J", "B000FIMG5Y", "B002BJGYTY", "B000VDDE0E", "B00F1FVKVC", "B000EHSVL4", "B000OIOOVE", "B00000IMY8", "B0026RLM6Q", "B000NOKFGW", "B0012EM5DI", "B0018CWEVW", "B000P6YNT8", "B00BGQ2NDO", "B00BBGZ17O", "B005CGI3ZG", "B000W6ZUUC", "B0018CWEZI", "B000R7HRRA", "B000ENUYGI", "B00I80DG6O", "B000EWBNMS", "B001FB4VX0", "B002JVWRBS", "B000H7JCGE", "B000FIMG4U", "B001G0MFD8", "B0009IW88K", "B000I0QLQY", "B0011UBDS6", "B003F3NE1G", "B00001PE4D", "B0001O3YLM", "B0006IUE16", "B002QZDSXI", "B00IGBIKV6", "B000OIOPHC", "B004SUDQ1I", "B000FIMG68", "B0009JKVSS", "B00915G6UI", "B000N6TYLW", "B000LV6VZ6", "B0000AKY3Q", "B009LDCWWG", "B000RF1QE2", "B0009CTVLS", "B000GG4Y6O", "B000FUTVLO", "B000GBEWSO", "B0009W5J4Q", "B000QDLSR0", "B00HQOFAKI", "B0006Q93BA", "B000EHSVLE", "B000JLTRIG", "B000EHQ7HY", "B000EHSVKK", "B003F3NDW6"], "bought_together": ["B00008AOX3", "B0002234R2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005CGI3ZG", "B00008AOX3", "B0002234R2", "B0007V6IW6"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 42566}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 17.57, "brand": "Columbia Tri Star", "asin": "B0000E5NPY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51C4JD1J0ZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Dawson's Creek - The Complete Second Season"}

{"description": "Released almost exactly 11 years after Clint Eastwood'sUnforgiven, Kevin Costner'sOpen Rangeproved yet again that the Western istheclassic American genre. While it lacks the thematic impact of Eastwood's masterpiece, Costner's first film since 1997's ill-fatedThe Postmanreturns the actor/director ofDances With Wolvesto the open prairies of America--in this case the free-range frontier of 1882--where legal \"free-grazing\" cattle drives were falling prey to empire-building land-owners. In the wake of territorial murder, free-grazing cowboys Boss (Robert Duvall) and Charley (Costner) seek vengeful justice against the ruthless rancher (Michael Gambon) who threatens their law-abiding survival. A feisty ally (the late Michael Jeter, in his next-to-final film role) and a doctor's sister (Annette Bening) offer support during climactic shootouts, masterfully staged with the shock and suddenness of real-life gunfire. Rich in character development and thick-hided humor, this handsome production redeemed Costner's directorial career with a well-told story (by Craig Storper, based on Lauran Paine's novelThe Open Range Men), flawless performances, and stunning Canadian locations.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000GFRI4K", "B0018PH3L0", "B000E5N6LG", "6304711905", "B001LRJH0U", "B004AOECXI", "B00116GEJS", "B0038EGD3I", "B00DZUV0M4", "B000XR9L50", "B003AWRMCE", "B00368PSKK", "B001LMAK88", "6305504024", "B00368PSKU", "B003NF97MQ", "B00005LOL0", "B003ASLJRC", "B00007G78A", "B002LII6PU", "B00AEBBA0E", "B001VC99HQ", "B003ASLJS6", "B003AWRM9M", "B003UESJME", "B002O3Z4XE", "B000BITVBA", "0767817710", "B000056H2J", "B00008IHAW", "B000059H7K", "B00005JMOW", "B0081FSMPG", "B0000YTP02", "B0045HCJTO", "B000EOTUSK", "B000W1SZBS", "B00CQ9VEDK", "B00008CMR4", "B001R0AY9Y", "B0007OY2OO", "078324021X", "0783228007", "B00AEFYSEA", "B0016OLXN2", "B00004WG2F", "B001KO1BCQ", "B00B83ROIE", "B00AEFYPHA", "B0018RWMNM", "B00A92MF6Q", "B004AOECTC", "B00002SSKG", "B00006AUHQ", "B00AEBBA36", "B00AEBB932", "B0035JHYJI", "B00004XPPG", "B009INAI02", "B002U4UYYQ", "0792839056", "B000KF0GWW", "0783229631", "B00001ZWUS", "B00007ELF1", "B00AMDA2OY", "B0006HBZXS", "B000NOIVT0", "B0007TKNM4", "B000A2WP7O", "B000A2WAQU", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00000K0DM", "B000O599Y4", "B001PO55AA", "B00005JNP4", "B000O599YE", "B00005JLV5", "B004KDYQYY", "B003Q7B6ZC", "B000P0J0EM", "B000ANVPP6", "B000O599WQ", "B001B187MU", "B007Y1NR1W", "B000059TFW", "B002O3Z510", "B00005JKZH", "B000P0J0EW", "6304698747", "B0045HCJSK", "B00AEBB8YM", "B00005JN0W", "B00IO03I6Q", "0792844874", "B000GIW9I2", "B0068FZ0O2", "078322592X", "B0006N2EZ0", "0783225725"], "bought_together": ["B000GFRI4K", "B0018PH3L0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0018PH3L0", "6304711905", "B004AOECXI", "B001LMAK88"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 3051}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.99, "brand": "Touchstone Video", "asin": "B0000TANUI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5166e3Ia3aL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Open Range"}

{"description": "BetweenFriends' fifth and sixth seasons, Courteney Cox and David Arquette were married, leading to \"The One After Vegas\" adding \"Arquette\" after everyone's title credits. Unfortunately, on-screen it's divorce time again despite \"The One When Ross Hugs Rachel,\" since he secretly tries avoiding an annulment of their accidental marriage. Far more out in the open is Chandler (Matthew Perry) and Monica's (Cox) relationship. Moving in together creates lots of fun as the others move back and forth into each other's apartments. It also leads to Joey (Matt LeBlanc) finally showing a tender side toward temporary roommate Janine (Elle Macpherson). By now his chat-up catchphrase \"How you doin'?\" had caught on, but he needed to fall for someone. He kept the fun alive all year, pretending to have a Porsche, starting work on the showMac and C.H.E.E.S.E., and falling for Chandler's (Matthew Perry) card game Cups in the excellent \"The One with the Last Night\" (one of many directed by David Schwimmer).More fun came from Ross (Schwimmer) trying to teach everyone the mental discipline Unagi, popping ridiculous moves with Monica for their childhood dance routine and having a fluorescently dazzling smile in \"The One with Ross's Teeth\" (also featuring a near-silent cameo from Ralph Lauren). Far more talkative was Reese Witherspoon as Rachel's (Jennifer Aniston) sister--another temptation for Ross. What they briefly had wasn't as complicated as later in \"The One Where Ross Meets Elizabeth's Dad,\" who turns out to be an Emmy-winning Bruce Willis (thanks to having become friends with Perry duringThe Whole Nine Yards). The fans' need for love interest and continuity had established the seasons' format now. Another two-part finale offers jeopardy--then resolution--from Tom Selleck's Richard in \"The One with the Proposal\" between Chandler and Monica.--Paul Tonks", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0001AW066", "B0000C2IXN", "B003TNW03K", "B0006ZM8M2", "B003TNW04Y", "B0000844MI", "B003TNW03A", "B000068CNX", "B003TNW02G", "B005IA9JQI", "B005IA9JSG", "B005MG8UNG", "B005IA9JQ8", "B00020HAWY", "B005IA9JVI", "B000ERVK5S", "B00B1LKXPY", "B008LCRA98", "B008LCRABQ", "B008LCRAFC", "B008LCRAC0", "B0007R4SWC", "B008L0YMZA", "B0058JEHTS", "B00005JLEX", "B000A7PKGW", "B000NA1PUG", "B000EHSVN2", "B002BAW6I6", "B008KZX7W0", "B000EHSVM8", "B000U1ZV1W", "B0001907BW", "B00EQ2KU7G", "B0006FFRBG", "B002BAW6HW", "B000NOKFH6", "B000N6TYLW", "B001VPJYZ0", "B000HT3P7E", "B005SJGIV8", "B008LCRA7K", "B0002UE1WQ", "B000Q6GUW0", "B000640WGM", "B000G1R3A8", "B0019CSXAM", "B000GETTKM", "B0012BS5XU", "B000BNTM46", "B007C8RZQ0", "B000TM1CKQ", "B000AAF1U4", "B001DPHDBU", "B002Q5WHF8", "B00005JNEQ", "B000GRUMQY", "B000NJISIY", "B000GPIPTM", "B000EHSVMS", "B008JBJAM6", "B000AJJNI6", "B000F0UUTG", "B000EBGFPY", "B000P6YNSO", "B004GJYRFA", "B00005JO9J", "B00005JLFT", "B000G1R4SY", "B00005JOHC", "B0018CWEXK", "B000T22PVG", "B003YLM79E", "B000SINT4S", "B0024FAR6Q", "B000BOH990", "B0015ABRE2", "B001DJLD2G", "B003R0MF7G", "B002BWOYKC", "B000FL7CAK", "B0001ZMWXW", "B0001CCXZW", "B00000F5W8", "B001VPJZ0O", "B00FRILRL6", "B004GJYRA0", "B00004TJKK", "B002BJGYU8", "B001TKJDNA", "B00AMHFMOK", "B000V86OKG", "B00E5I2M6I", "B000QFCDAO", "B001FB4VZS", "B001RIZ7OI", "B00HEQOAIQ", "B0009OL7Z4", "B004EPZ0BG", "B003F3NE1Q"], "bought_together": ["B0001AW066", "B0000C2IXN"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003TNW04Y", "B005IA9JRM", "B0000C2IXN", "B0000844MI"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 51393}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 24.65, "brand": "Warner Bros", "asin": "B0000X2ECE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510SVY4JD9L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Friends: Season 6"}
{"description": "Diary of a Country Priestis the first masterpiece by the great Robert Bresson, a towering and slow-working figure in French cinema. Starkly adapted from a successful novel by Georges Bernanos, the film locks in to the mind of a sickly, ineffective young priest trapped in an unfriendly rural area. Bresson charts the priest's collapse with a series of brief scenes, a minimalist style that makes the slightest touch of a hand or far-off sound of a dog barking seem magnified in importance. (This is a movie that must be watched and listened to--it is not a casual experience.) Bresson's luminous portrait of faith and worldly humiliations takes on the intensity of a saint's notebook. In the central role is Claude Laydu, one of Bresson's early experiments with non-actors; his sad, open face is often in close-up, lighting our way into a world of private salvation.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00092ZLEY", "B000K0YLX2", "B000BB14IA", "B008DL4K8Q", "B00AQ6J6H6", "B00005B1ZK", "B000087EY6", "0786709618", "0780022343", "B0007OC6ZG", "0780021541", "B0009298N4", "B000HT3QBE", "B00008RH15", "6305744114", "B000QXDFRQ", "B0001ZIYDO", "B00K5EJHGO", "B00004Z1FM", "B000HKH0WY", "B001D8W7EK", "B004ALIG1U", "B00006673O", "B00GA9F2PI", "B00005JKGX", "B00005QAPJ", "B00005EBSB", "0780020707", "0780023234", "B000087F79", "B000087F6L", "B000ZM1MIM", "B000I8OOG0", "B001WLMOL4", "B0046ZYEVG", "B00014K5Y6", "B0035ECHIG", "B003N2CVRC", "B000UJ48Q8", "B00004ZBVO", "B0007WFYC0", "B000PKG6O4", "B004ALIG4W", "B00005JKPT", "B0000633SD", "B001D8W7F4", "B00DZP1BUU", "B002U6DVQ2", "B00ATK02FO", "B0000WN0ZK", "B00HE011DE", "B002E01M9W", "B001S400C0", "B001WLMOLE", "B00EO2I6W4", "B00009Y3OK", "B00A8QDHYW", "B00000IOKV", "B003ELKNO0", "B00004W457", "B000059H7Q", "B00005NFZB", "B008CJ0JS4", "1559408677", "B0019X400I", "B0002KPHZG", "B000025RE7", "B0082LUGPI", "B000N2HBIO", "B00AIBZLHS", "B000BB14I0", "B00026L74U", "B001EOQCMG", "B001WLMOOG", "B00005JLHW", "B004ALIG4M", "B00HVOFP6W", "B0007989Y8", "B000093NR0", "B005HK13S6", "B00008H2GS", "B00006FMAR", "B000OYNVOY", "B00007CVS2", "B00000F7E6", "B00062134E", "B0000A02TX", "B0001GH5RY", "B000065V38", "B00005NFZA", "B000BC8SWE", "B00AZMFM3I", "B00005UQ7T", "B00026L75E", "1559409053", "B004WPYO7E", "B00GPPXNEE", "B00023P4N8", "B0009RCPUC", "B006TTC5MM"], "bought_together": ["B00092ZLEY", "B000K0YLX2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0786709618", "B000K0YLX2", "B001UF5KOU", "B00092ZLEY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 71813}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 109.99, "brand": "LAYDU,CLAUDE", "asin": "B000127IF2", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41HPU1k3HsL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Diary of a Country Priest (The Criterion Collection)"}
{"description": "Granada Television's powerful adaptation of John Galsworthy's novels about the sprawling, fractious and aristocratic Forsyte family moves into the 1920s with Series Two, based on the author'sTo Let. The drama shifts to a new generation shouldering the burdensome legacies of an aging Soames (Damian Lewis) and his failed marriage to free-spirited Irene (Gina McKee). The lovely Fleur (Emma Griffiths Malin), Soames's daughter by second wife Annette (Beatriz Batarda), and strapping Jon (Lee Williams), son of Irene and Soames's bohemian cousin, Jolyon (Rupert Graves), develop a romance much to the dismay of their feuding parents. But the long reach of the elder Forsytes' sins--and the tenderness with which they seek redemption through their children--ultimately undercuts the young lovers' happiness.Meanwhile, sundry characters move in and out of the Forsytes' orbit, including a French businessman (Michael Maloney) stirring more troubles for Soames and an art dealer (Oliver Milburn) with designs on Fleur. As withSeries One, all this will feel familiar to anyone who has seen the26-part, 1967 versionofThe Forsyte Saga(the program that arguably created public television as we know it). Yet this updated effort renews and redefines the Forsytes' overlapping tragedies, with a more interior feel and a first-rate contemporary cast.

{"description": "Pay cable's \"other\"show about life and death,Dead Like Metakes a darkly comic look at mortality through the eyes of someone stuck between this life and the afterlife. \"Bail bondsmen for the disembodied\" is how Rube (Mandy Patinkin), the often exasperated Reaper foreman, explains it to disaffected 18-year-old George (Ellen Muth) after she&rsquo;s vaporized by a falling toilet seat from theMirspace station and drafted into the ranks of the Reapers. It's now her job to take the souls of the doomed, preferably before their mortal coil is damaged beyond recognition by the devilish machinations of the gremlin-like gravelings.You wouldn&rsquo;t mistake George's fellow Reapers for the do-gooders ofTouched by an Angel, but they are anything but grim. Charming British shyster Mason (Callum Blue) always has some scam brewing, high-living, fun-loving former flapper Betty (Rebecca Gayheart) treats death as a cabaret (\"Reaping Havoc\"), and one-time starlet and wannabe actress Daisy (Laura Harris) still nurses her dreams of stardom. Even hard-bitten meter maid Roxy (Jasmine Guy) manages to find a way to let loose.Dead Like Meputs a light touch on black comedy, but it has a sneaky way of using humor to explore loss, loneliness, and regret, as well as kindness, and courage, and responsibility. George gets a hard lesson when she tries to wriggle out of her assignments like some overgrown kid, only to see the damage of her (in)action in \"Reapercussions.\" And as George's angry, tightly-wound mother (Cynthia Stevenson) and withdrawn little sister Reggie cope with death, she breaks the rules to watch over them: their own pouty, glum guardian angel. There's nothing like your own death to put your life into perspective.The four-disc set features all 14 episodes of the debut season of Showtime's witty black comedy. The feature-length pilot includes optional commentary by cast members Ellen Muth, Mandy Patinkin, Jasmine Guy, Cynthia Stevenson, and Callum Blue. Other supplements include the nominal documentary featurettesDead Like Me: Behind-the-scenesandThe Music of Dead Like Me(with theme song composer Stewart Copeland), 32 deleted scenes, and a still gallery.--Sean AxmakerStills fromDead Like Me - The Complete First Season(Click for larger image)&nbsp;&nbsp;", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00094ARGY", "B001JV5BHQ", "B0006GAO18", "B00GT4NCK6", "B000YAA2SQ", "B001FB4VZ8", "B001EN5I3Q", "B001WAKNCC", "B005SEDI5M", "B0007TKHKC", "B001A7X0ZO", "B001XW7ICW", "B000EHSVKK", "B00GT2TEPU", "B001FB4VZI", "B000O77SMW", "B008PJZDXW", "B00DNUSFZQ", "B000GG4Y28", "B000QDLSR0", "B000E6EK42", "B0002JP4DW", "B000AO9BSS", "B0018CWEYY", "B000I0QLR8", "B005PPMHO2", "B000U1ZV1W", "B000I0QLQY", "B0019LY5IM", "B0018CWEXA", "B00005JNOG", "B000I0QLRI", "B000GH3CWK", "B004BZ5AHI", "B008H1Q61G", "B004SMDJ9U", "B0001KL5DA", "B0007R4SWM", "B000I0QLRS", "B003L77GWE", "B001ASIHZG", "B0019Z3P84", "B003R0MEYA", "B0009NZ2W4", "B0051GOB2G", "B0002XVKMM", "B00022FWEU", "B000O77SN6", "B001C8W7EQ", "B000FIMG68", "B002AK9UPO", "B00540G3GG", "B004X60QE2", "B000MEYKCS", "B000SMNL92", "B00HUCF7AO", "B001DPHDBU", "B00133QNS6", "B0025KVKDO", "B000NOKFH6", "B0081QF6Q8", "B002GP7ZV4", "B003FSTN7K", "B000T9OP7G", "B000HWZ4MA", "B0002PYS7Y", "B007AFC0W4", "B000FL7CAK", "B00062IDEW", "B001AZIRZ4", "B000ERVJKE", "B000ENUYGI", "B0009IW88K", "B0000AQS0F", "B002N5N5MK", "B000GTLQVW", "B001B7CNZ6", "B0000AUHQE", "B00GOC74QG", "B008B4KVRE", "B009AMAGQM", "B008YRL6LI", "B002BWP2IK", "B004XM38CS", "B000SO7PBU", "B000EOTV98", "B00005JPII", "B0085KGG96", "B000GG4Y5K", "B004QOB8TS", "B000Q6GUW0", "0792159659", "B001DF681G", "B002CAWNEM", "B0037AGB9O", "B002D1XKB0", "B008QE9XD2", "B00A8KJN8M"], "bought_together": ["B001JV5BHQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00GT2TEPU", "B000YAA2SQ", "B0006GAO18", "B001FB4VZ8"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 35276}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 49.98, "brand": "MUTH,ELLEN", "asin": "B0001GF2F6", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ZLwUB8oPL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Dead Like Me - The Complete First Season"}

The longest segment (12 minutes) is a puffy promotional piece hosted by Sarah Ferguson that goes over everything lightly, including the history of the tale. Note: this film would be a perfect candidate to have both a pan-and-scan and widescreen presentation on the same disc. The widescreen 2.40:1 ratio is pretty extreme for those who don't like seeing black bars on their set, but the film is so gorgeous you'll miss a lot on the full-screen edition.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B006JN87WK", "0767836324", "B004SIP7PS", "B00CTQWJEI", "B00CQRN3QI", "B000VKL6RK", "B003RHZ6IE", "B001HN694K", "0147508657", "B00011D190", "1495266699", "B00B4FZ8U2", "B00005JM9Q", "B00005JN2B", "B00736PCDO", "6305428042", "B000GB775E", "B00001YXE2", "B0011U52E2", "B00AEBB8KQ", "B00CTQWJPW", "B00139W3NE", "B0009XRZS8", "B000E8M0VA", "B00C1LIYZY", "B00005JPH2", "B004IMPRLS", "1407599461", "1468149822", "B000WE79MQ", "B00005JM7T", "B00H5RYIBI", "B000056T4I", "B00J0TSY1E", "B000OYCM5I", "B00009XUM5", "B0000524D0", "B002GOAH10", "B006X08DZ0", "1423160290", "B00E5RYCGM", "0736402381", "B0000VCZKM", "B00AEFZ6V4", "B00CTNYLQA", "B002GIBVV6", "B000077VR3", "0141329815", "B0006J28MI", "B000BB1MI2", "B005F96UJ6", "B000C3L27U", "B003Y5H52O", "B00A0MJA1I", "B000065V42", "B001CTDH4Y", "B0007LXPBI", "B001GCUO7A", "B000GW8U1I", "0783226810", "B000053VAZ", "B0013ND30M", "B00C888MJ8", "B000QQLVPQ", "6304711867", "B000065V44", "B002GJTYIW", "6305870179", "B004SIP75S", "B0087F7VSY", "B003ZHVJGO", "B00CNW9ZI6", "B0058YPL66", "B000324Y98", "B003NHRIVQ", "B00G5G7EXY", "B005LAIHSG", "B00009YXAW", "B000AAF1U4", "B006VRRGNK", "B000Q66FB6", "B005COPWZW", "B001NPD9JA", "B005IA9JZO", "B001R3YRIU", "B002GOAH1A", "B00AEFY9RG", "B005LAII0I", "B003L4Y5BW", "B008YWY0HK", "B002VPE1BQ", "B00005JLR2", "B001O5LVPI", "B0007KTBIU", "0767851013", "1558908404", "B002ZG99CC"], "bought_together": ["0767836324"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00CQRN3QI", "0767836324", "B00CTQWJEI", "B004SIP7PS"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 6592}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.89, "brand": "Universal Studios", "asin": "B0001HAISG", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ANKSAE62L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Peter Pan (Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "No actor works harder to open a movie than Tom Cruise. His enthusiasm is throughout the DVD extras as he mirrors his samurai character by constantly talking about \"loyalty\" and \"discipline\" while working on the film. However as a post-movie experience, the top-line extras with Cruise and director Edward Zwick are repetitive and underwhelming, with too many clips from the film we assume DVD viewers have just seen. The History Channel show is also a pre-release promotional device that misses an opportunity to really dig into this intriguing time period. Better are segments on the costumes, the production design, and how you put together an Imperial army--in New Zealand, no less. Zwick's low-key and dense commentary (plus a \"Video Journal\") is not vital, but he illustrates many of the little peculiarities it took to make the wide-ranging film come together. There are two deleted scenes; a samurai's first appearance is particularly memorable.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEFY5B6", "B002O3Z50Q", "B00004XPPG", "B00AMSLDTM", "B0002YLCG0", "B0000DZTIW", "B000AARKOO", "B000QXDED6", "B003U0AHBO", "B00AEFXKUI", "B000A2WP7O", "B008MIMWOY", "B00AEBBA36", "B004AOECXI", "6305692688", "B000MGB6NM", "B0000TANUI", "079283366X", "B00005JL78", "B000W1SZBS", "B004SIP88Y", "B0034G4P58", "B001TUZG4K", "B00AS1Q93S", "B000MRA592", "B00001ZWUS", "B000E5N6LG", "B000XR9L50", "B0001HLVS2", "B00HEPDGKA", "B003ASLJO0", "B00AEBB9NM", "B000P0J0EW", "B0000A2ZNX", "B00005JNTI", "B0018QPPXW", "B000065U1N", "B000095WW8", "B0002WZTOI", "B002VWNIEA", "B004U7MQWY", "B002VWNID6", "B008JFUO36", "B00AEBB86A", "B00005JN0W", "B0007Q6VXC", "B001LRJH0U", "B000MZHW40", "B0002IQMAM", "B00004WG2F", "B003INBO3I", "B000EHRVMY", "B000NOKFHQ", "B000P0J0EM", "B00AEFXVCU", "B000YENUI6", "B000M341QE", "B0000YEEGM", "B001680M26", "B008R65XYC", "B002ZG99QS", "B00008K76U", "B000HRMAPE", "B007TBKAXK", "B00000G3PA", "0767810856", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B00AEFXYJA", "B002T9H2LA", "B000P0J0AG", "B00003CXZ1", "B000O599YO", "B000FS9FCG", "6304711905", "B00AEFXRRO", "B000HRMAUY", "B001ILHY1I", "B002NZK5V4", "B002VWNICC", "B000VKL6ZM", "B001UDS4BS", "B002ZG997C", "B004SIP8ZM", "0800177967", "B0001O3YD0", "B00005ATZT", "B004XFZ3UU", "B00004Z4WR", "B005LAIH2W", "B0007TKNGA", "B00000JQB5", "B0012Q732O", "B002ZG97RE", "B0002VEUV2", "0800141741", "B002ZG977Y", "B00005N5S3", "B00008G8M4", "B0000B1OFL"], "bought_together": ["B00AEFY5B6", "B00004XPPG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000QXDED6", "B00BEJL6JK", "B00AEFXXMI", "B00JU949TK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 121880}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 17.25, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B0001JXOUS", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51EdSWs9r9L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Last Samurai (Full Screen Edition)"}

{"description": "Though season 9 may not be the best period in a long line of groundbreaking television, it is still worthy of theX-Filesname. Knowing this was the last season had many fans prematurely disgruntled, and the expectation for \"going out with a bang\" was extremely high. Lots of longtime issues came to a head (Scully's single motherhood, new X-files agents at the helm, Agent Skinner is now a believer, Mulder MIA, etc.), and many new issues and plots arose. Learning the facts of his son's death, Agent Doggett (Robert Patrick) seeks out the missing Agent Mulder (David Duchovny) to help him expose the corrupt Deputy Director Kersh (James Pickens Jr.). Knowing that her gifted son William is a target of a religious cult, Scully (Gillian Anderson) enlists the help of the Lone Gunmen for protection. The missing Mulder is finally located. Unfortunately, he is being held in custody by the military on murder charges, which leads to the grand finale: the trial, not for a man guilty of murder, but for a man guilty of seekingthe Truth.The naysayers have plenty of valid complaints (particularly about the \"Super Soldiers\" segue), and many hated that the Mulder/Scully pairing was gone, but there are a few aspects that are universally positive, and there aren't many complaints about their replacements, Agent Doggett and Agent Reyes (Annabeth Gish). In fact, many feel that the show could have easily continued if the show's writing had been better. The final episode was more or less a 90-minute recap of theX-Filesphenomenon. After \"The Truth\" ended, disappointed hardcore fans couldn't help but feel it was a set-up for an upcoming movie, but casual fans should find the episode very helpful in linking together the mythos that entranced and confused viewers for years.

{"description": "The turbulent lives of two handsome and high-priced Miami plastic surgeons may be one of the more unusual premises for a television series, but the FX Channel'sNip/Tuckcombines sudsy sex and biting wit with the emotional quandaries involved in body modification in a way that makes for an engrossing--and occasionally gross--hourlong drama. The show benefits greatly from its two leads--Dylan Walsh as the troubled \"good\" surgeon and Julian McMahon as his predatory (but equally troubled) \"bad\" partner--as well as Joely Richardson as Walsh's wife and Roma Maffia as the surgeons' nurse. IfNip/Tuckdoes have a stumbling point, it's in its occasionally glib dialogue (series creator Ryan Murphy was a writer for the verbally flashy high school seriesPopular), which can clash with an episode's more dramatic and poignant moments. The show also doesn't shy away from showing the more gruesome aspects of plastic surgery, but viewers can often see more stomach-churning images on the top-ratedCSI. But the strength of the performances and the originality of the premise make these rough spots manageable for viewers looking for an interesting spin on the usual \"doctor show.\" The five-DVD set offers an extended version of the pilot and all 12 episodes of the first season as well as a trio of documentaries (one on the show itself, another on its special effects, and a third, \"Realistic Expectations,\" on real-life plastic surgeons). A gag reel (amusingly titled \"Severed Parts\"), a selection of deleted scenes for most episodes, and a music video for the title theme (\"A Perfect Lie\" by the Engine Room) round out the box.--Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0009IW88K", "B000FUTVLO", "B000QUTTPG", "B0013FSL16", "B003CN5SAY", "B001PQZYQI", "B000QUTTPQ", "1419811118", "B00079FUI6", "B0008JIJ1A", "B001QE99AQ", "B000ENUYGI", "B000OIOOVE", "B000Q6GUKW", "B00166647K", "B00HT851LO", "B000FFJYE8", "B00005JO9J", "B000FIMG4U", "B000FVQLIO", "B000FIMG5Y", "B00008AOX3", "B000QUTTQ0", "B00005JNOG", "B000FIMG68", "B00JF5GAZA", "B002WQ799U", "B000QDLSR0", "B0018CWEZI", "B000P6YNTI", "B0012CJQY6", "B00166UFSY", "B0024FAR5M", "B0036TGTF2", "B000P6YNSE", "B0012CJQYG", "B000FKO3GW", "B00005JPII", "B001AQBGM4", "B000P6YNSO", "B001FB4W0W", "B0007QS324", "B000V86OKG", "B001B7CNZ6", "B002N5N5QQ", "B000YABIQ6", "B000FUTVPA", "B0002RQ3MK", "B000NDEXK2", "B000Q6GUW0", "B001B7N4WM", "B002WQ79A4", "B0018CWEYY", "B000YW8RPE", "B003L77GRO", "B0015ABRE2", "B000R9YLKY", "B00005JNEQ", "B001VPJYZK", "B0012CJQZA", "B0002V7TZQ", "B0012CJQZ0", "B003F3NDP8", "B001LM64UG", "B0002MPQRS", "B0012CJQYQ", "B0018CWEYO", "B0000E5NPY", "B000R7HRRA", "B0011NVCAM", "B0002234R2", "B001ILFUAA", "B003CPPY5G", "B000P12LWY", "B00004RFCM", "B001MVWRNE", "B00IYMSMTM", "B000RW3VDE", "B002GHHHL0", "B002AMVED8", "B000E3L7F0", "B00168ML34", "B0055SNHQG", "B000FS9MY2", "B0013ZGN9I", "B00009Y3RW", "B005FISBTO", "B0006IUE16", "B000HT3P6U", "B0009K7QZ8", "B000G1R4TS", "B000JLTRJK", "B008H6GHF6", "B000B8IA08", "B00005JMMT", "B003LXM1PK", "B001CY5N1E", "B002N5N5M0", "B000MGBSI0", "B000G6BL88"], "bought_together": ["B0009IW88K", "B000FUTVLO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000QUTTPG", "B001PQZYQI", "B0013FSL16", "B003XWEQ8E"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 11266}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 12.99, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B0001O3YLM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51%2B5PfPHCXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Nip/Tuck: Season 1"}

{"description": "The \"Magnum Farce\" ofSledge Hammeraims at deserving targets and scores a bull's eye every time. Thanks to DVD, one of the funniest, most unconventional sitcoms of the 1980s has been gloriously revived, with an abundance of bonus features that fans are going to love. This is sweet revenge given the show's original ABC time-slot, buried underMiami ViceandDallason Friday nights, but creator-producer Alan Spencer's savvy spoof ofDirty Harryhad critical praise in its favor when it premiered (with a senseless laugh track, mercifully deleted here) on September 23, 1986. Played to perfection by David Rasche and introduced with an infectious Danny Elfman theme song, Sledge is a trigger-happy male chauvinist pig (er, cop) in mismatched clothes who thinksThe Deer Hunteris a comedy, sleeps with his .44 Magnum (called simply \"Gun\"), drives a bullet-riddled sedan with an \"I &hearts; Violence\" bumper sticker, and somehow manages to always catch his quarry. \"I'm a nihilist, not a stylist\" he says (in the hilarious episode \"Sledgepoo\"), and that puts him at reckless odds with his lovely, karate-kicking partner Dori (played with flawless aplomb by former soap-star Anne-Marie Martin) and the vocally volcanic Capt. Trunk (Harrison Page, a slow-burn master and vital ingredient to the show's excellent casting).Partly inspired byGet Smart!, Spencer and a host of talented writers and directors dished up consistent laughs and daring anarchy, challenging broadcast standards with topnotch spoofs of hit movies (in episodes titled \"Witless,\" \"Jagged Sledge,\" \"The Color of Hammer,\" etc.) while familiar guest stars like John Vernon, Brion James, Clint Howard, Michael De Barres, and Mary Woronov raised the comedy quotient even higher. After a deliberately outrageous, go-for-broke season finale it's a miracle that the low-ratedSledge Hammer!was renewed for a second season, but Anchor Bay's DVDs do justice to the show's enduring quality, and Spencer's commentaries (on four episodes) rank among the funniest ever recorded (one of them during an earthquake, no less). All in all, this is one of the most delightful DVD surprises of 2004, with more fun to come in season 2.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0007LPSI6", "B000H7JCFK", "B005NKIPUO", "B0000AUHQE", "B000F7CMPE", "B000PGTPC8", "B000FJH5MC", "B000N6UF10", "B00004U103", "B003FVB7DU", "B00AJCUL1C", "B003L77GUG", "B0032JTUX4", "B00005JNIS", "B0019HQICW", "B005PPMHWE", "B000SQFC2M", "B006JN87CU"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005NKIPUO", "B000F7CMPE", "B000H7JCFK", "B000KL6LX4"]}, "price": 24.2, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 119318}, "asin": "B0001ZX0EW", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/517VXSFJ1NL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Sledge Hammer! - Season One"}

{"description": "TheBabylon 5pilot movieThe Gatheringwas originally broadcast in 1993 a full year ahead of the regular show. A somewhat dull tale of an attempt to assassinate Koch, the Vorlon ambassador toB5, the feature served to introduce Commander Jeffery Sinclair (Michael O'Hare) and Security Chief Michael Garibaldi (Jerry Doyle) as well as familiarize the audience with the unique environment of a five-mile-long space station in the year 2257. Missing many of the main cast, and suffering from a leaden pace and mediocre music score, series creator J Michael Straczynski later improvedThe Gatheringby tightening the cut for a special edition (the version released on DVD), adding some deleted character moments and commissioning a new score from series composer Christopher Franke.Four new TV movies were part of the deal to syndicateBabylon 5.In the Beginningis a prelude set 10 years beforeBabylon 5, telling the story of the Earth-Minbari war. Told retrospectively, many of the mysteries revealed gradually in the main series are recounted, making the show a collection of spoilers for newcomers while adding little for established fans. It is effective to see events only previously talked about, and enjoyable to have most of the main cast playing younger versions of themselves.River of Soulsis a self-contained adventure featuring a return of the Soul Hunters from Season One, whileThirdspaceoffers a spectacular Lovecraftian space opera which slots into the saga after the end of the Shadow War.A Call to Armsis the most important of the TV films, laying the ground for the future TV seriesCrusade.

{"description": "Season 2 ofI Love Lucyincludes two of the most famous half-hours in television history. \"Job Switching,\" originally broadcast mid-September of 1952, is the crazy, battle-of-the-sexes episode in which husbands Ricky Ricardo (Desi Arnaz) and Fred Mertz (William Frawley) trade roles with wives Lucy (Lucille Ball) and Ethel (Vivian Vance), culminating in the men making a shambles of domestic chores while Lucy and Ethel take disastrous work at a chocolate factory. That's right: This is the show where the ladies have a Chaplinesque experience with a too-fast factory conveyor belt, forcing them to hide candies in their mouths, in their hats, and down their blouses lest a tough forewoman fire them for incompetence. A half-century later, the scene is still so fresh and funny it would grace any current sitcom. \"Lucy Goes to the Hospital,\" which received an amazing 71.7 rating on January 19, 1953, is the historic episode featuring the birth of Little Ricky and a load of wonderful slapstick. Other television series (The Dick Van Dyke Show) and movies (Nine Months) have tried to topLucy's time-to-go-to-the-hospital shenanigans, but there's nothing like the sight of Ricky and Fred falling all over themselves or Ricky showing up at the maternity ward (direct from a voodoo-themed show at the Tropicana) in witch doctor makeup.The other 31 episodes included inI Love Lucy: The Compete Second Seasonhave choice moments, too. \"Lucy Becomes a Sculptress\" finds the ever-ambitious redhead falling for empty flattery at an art-supply store and commencing an ill-advised career working in clay. Ricky agrees to bless this new endeavor if an art critic says she has talent, but Lucy tries to increase her chances by posing as a bust of herself--resulting in mayhem, of course. The usual running themes inI Love Lucy--Lucy's misguided desire to be a part of Ricky's musical career, and her penchant for disguising herself to investigate something--are all overThe Complete Second Season. \"Ricky Loses His Voice\" is a delightful piece in which Ricky's laryngitis inspires Lucy, the Mertzes, and an aging chorus line to put on a Tropicana spectacle, and \"Ricky Has Labor Pains\" finds Lucy and Ethel going undercover as male reporters to find out what happens at a stag party.  Lots to enjoy here, and the special features include bloopers, information about the guest cast, and snippets from Ball's radio show.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B008KZX7W0", "B008L3653O", "B008L3650M", "B008VNI9TC", "B008VNIBTK", "B008VNI9EW", "B00EC9UHZI", "B000EHQU08", "B0085Z6ZD8", "B0002NY8PI", "B000B8I9ZY", "B0007Y08P6", "B0000BV1XX", "B00274SIVK", "B00C6F61S2", "B00363WGIC", "B000AJJNJK", "B00006DXXT", "B0007KTBJO", "B003IB0FSU", "B0002W4SX6", "B0009UC7MK", "B000I2J6VE", "B00FWMVVF4", "B001BSBBSK", "B00GOC75YW", "B000SSQ7JW", "B0085Z6Z2O", "B001AXOFR0", "B00009VRF0", "B004MLEYUK", "B000BYRCF6", "0399142053", "B000EGDANO", "B0000AUXVS", "B0006T6MJ8", "B000HDR814", "B000C1VBAA", "B001992NZG", "B000AL733G", "B00KOW4AZ0", "B000UX6TKM", "B0012EM5EW", "B000M343AI", "B00308B170", "B00BI3XZA0", "B00CPTUN8S", "B002AL2TQK", "B00AQ5SPBU", "B00I099K4U", "B000KGGIL4", "B000BT96OG", "B001E6JC1W", "B00151QYYE", "B000EBGFQI", "B005DDN51A", "B001KGDNBG", "B0006Z2L4W", "B0007R4SWC", "B00GLT2SOA", "B004UOHNH0", "B00005JKF6", "B001GMH8WO", "B004CQZFL2", "B00AEBB8OC", "B00005JLIC", "B000B5XOUM", "B001LM64VK", "B000NJISIY", "B000BNTM46", "B00I458456", "B000EHQU0I", "B0009OUBPQ", "B0006BAWSI", "B0072BNJ0I", "B0000C2IVT", "B000291Q3O", "B0058J3S16", "B0012GVMIK", "B006TTC5Y0", "B00D2UMHB0", "B0002NY8R6", "B005F265IE", "B001TWT0CW", "B0002XNT08", "B0007WFXL2", "B005OASMLU", "B00JAD6BYW", "B00H8KC1N4", "B00AEFYNG8", "0425177319", "B002E58FTW", "B00FM4S7P4", "B00DJYK1XU", "B000291Q3Y", "B002VWNIAY", "B007I1TFK0", "B008MIYKB2", "B000HT3PGU"], "bought_together": ["B008KZX7W0", "B008L3653O"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B008KZX7W0", "B000TGJ8B2", "B008L3653O", "B008L3650M"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 74998}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 22.95, "brand": "Paramount", "asin": "B0002ERX8G", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Q8MV5PDEL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "I Love Lucy - The Complete Second Season"}

{"description": "The facts have become legend.Star Trek, the NBC series that premiered on September 8, 1966, has become a touchstone of international popular culture. It struggled through three seasons that included cancellation and last-minute revival, and turned its creator, Gene Roddenberry, into the progenitor of an intergalactic phenomenon. Eventually expanding to encompass five separate TV series, an ongoing slate of feature films, and a fan base larger than the population of many third-world countries, theStar Trekuniverse began not with a Big Bang but with a cautious experiment in network TV programming. Even before its premiere episode (\"The Man Trap\") was aired,Star Trekhad struggled to attain warp-drive velocity, barely making it into the fall '66 NBC lineup.The series' original pilot, \"The Cage,\" featured Jeffrey Hunter as U.S.S.Enterprisecaptain Christopher Pike--a variation of the role that would eventually catapult William Shatner to TV stardom. Filmed in 1964, the pilot was rejected by NBC the following year, but the network made a rare decision to order a second pilot. \"Where No Man Has Gone Before\" was filmed in 1965, and only one character from the previous pilot remained--a pointy-eared alien named Spock (played by Leonard Nimoy), whom Roddenberry had retained despite network disapproval. The second pilot was accepted, and production onStar Trekbegan in earnest with the filming of its first regular episode, \"The Corbomite Maneuver.\"Never a ratings success despite a growing population of devoted fans,Star Trekwas canceled after its second season, prompting a letter-writing campaign that resulted in the series' third-season renewal. It was a mixed blessing, since Roddenberry had departed as producer to protest the network's neglect, andStar Trek's third season contained most of the series' weakest episodes. And yet, the show continued to \"to explore strange new worlds&#x85;to seek out new life and new civilizations&#x85;to boldly go where no man [a phrase later amended to \"no one\"] has gone before.\"There were milestones along the way. The first interracial kiss on network primetime TV (between Shatner and series co-star Nichelle Nichols) furthered a richly positive and expansive view of a better, nobler future for humankind. The series offered a timelessly appealing balance of humor, imagination, and character depth. And at least one episode (Harlan Ellison's \"The City on the Edge of Forever\") ranks among the finest science fiction stories in any popular medium. Beloved by long-time fans in spite of its cheesy sets and costumes, and the now-dated trappings of late-1960s American culture, \"classicTrek\" has aged remarkably well, and its sense of adventure and idealism continues to live long and prosper.--Jeff ShannonThe three 2004 DVD sets collect all 79 episodes of the show, including \"The Cage\" in both a restored color version and the original, never-aired version that alternates between color and black and white. Each set is supplemented by over an hour of featurettes incorporating new and old interviews with Shatner, Nimoy, other cast members, and producers, and there's also some vintage footage of Gene Roddenberry. Accompanying the 20-minute seasonal recaps (\"To Boldly Go...\") are a number of interesting featurettes: \"The Birth of a Timeless Legacy\" examines the two pilot episodes and the development of the crew; \"Sci-Fi Visionaries\" discusses the series' great science fiction writers; Nimoy debunks various rumors in \"Reflections of Spock\"; \"Kirk, Spock & Bones: The Great Trio\" focuses on the interplay among Kirk, Spock, and Dr. McCoy (DeForest Kelley); and, in what is probably his lastStar Trekappearance, James Doohan (Scotty), slowed by Alzheimer's but still with a twinkle in his eye, recalls his voiceover roles and his favorite episodes.  As they've done for many of thefeature-film special editions, Michael Okuda and Denise Okuda provide a pop-up text commentary on four of the episodes filled with history, trivia, and dry wit. It's the first commentary of any kind for aStar TrekTV show, but an audio commentary is still overdue. The technical specs are mostly the same as otherTrekTV series--Dolby 5.1, English subtitles--but with the welcome addition of the episode trailers. The plastic cases are an attempt to replicate some of the fun packaging of the series' European DVD releases, but it's a bit clunky, and the paper sleeve around the disc case seems awkward and crude.

{"description": "Weird! Wild! Wood! The most legendary B-movie director of all time, Edward D. Wood, Jr. assaulted audiences worldwide with a string of bizarre, no-budget fusions of horror, science fiction, noir and comedy. Now his oddball legacy is finally collected in one indispensable box set! Feast your eyes on his first feature, the madcap Glen or Glenda? in which Eddie himself portrays a transvestite struggling with his addiction to angora while Bela Lugosi offers inscrutable narration. Blackmail, outlaws on the run, and plastic surgery collide in the surreal crime drama Jail Bait, featuring a young Steve Reeves (Hercules), while Bela returns to create the Bride of the Monster in a heady collision of atomic experiments, a rampaging octopus and clumsy assistant Lobo (played by wrestler Tor Johnson). Wood's indisputable disasterpiece, Plan 9 from Outer Space, offers pie-plate flying saucers, incompetent alien leaders, all-seeing psychic Criswell, goth favorite Vampira and a post-mortem appearance by Lugosi himself in his last film role. Then Lobo and a phony spiritualist usher in a Night of the Ghouls at a spooky marsh filled with shuffling undead and wailing ghosts. Finally, learn all about the man himself with The Haunted World of Ed Wood, a comprehensive disc packed with interviews, film clips, TV rarities and much more!

{"description": "Anybody hungering for a good old-fashioned Western needs to check outWarriors of Heaven and Earth, which--although it's set in 7th-century China--has all the valor and spectacle of a John Ford picture. It also has a goofy supernatural streak, for the chopsocky crowd. The opening 10 minutes or so offer an alarmingly convoluted plot, but it swiftly settles down. What's going on is that a long-exiled Japanese hit man (Kiichi Nakai), hired to kill a renegade Chinese warrior (Jiang Wen), temporarily teams up with his quarry in order to escort a camel caravan along the Spice Road. Of course, they are menaced by a brutal warlord, and beautiful Zhao Wei (So Close) is mixed in there too. Director He Ping (Red Firecracker, Green Firecracker) captures some magnificent vistas in the Gobi Desert, but more importantly he sketches the codes or honor and behavior essential to any such tale.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001MEJY9G", "B00104AYGK", "B002C6VMIY", "B0019PL2W0", "B006C1S1DY", "B000E1EHPE", "B0030A6ICG", "B004TFTE9A", "B000ICLU7C", "B009VL2AZM", "B003DVB7F0", "B005FQ1OOK", "B006MWA91A", "B0035JHYHA", "B000MRA592", "B0056OZI0W", "B00B6OEE7O", "B00ET2ODYY", "B0016MJ6JC", "B008XEZXES", "B008645YLM", "B005ZMBEXA", "B00G3HOJZ6", "B00576U9HQ", "B009VL2A5M", "B004VW4V9E", "B00ENTX7JU", "B0056OZI16", "B004SIP88Y", "B005F96UGO", "7885142833", "B0051SFTGQ", "B000EE3FUY", "B000K2UW06", "B001F34HT6", "B008IG0B0C", "B008OTTRE4", "B00HSJ2EMI", "B003EVAG4C", "B000P6R9N0", "B004XQO8MS", "B005F96UHI", "7885142515", "B003G715IK", "B00B4MMVVY", "B000MM0LEG", "B00GXFZOYI", "B001R10BDW", "B0007Q6VXC", "B0004Z302Q", "B001MEJY9Q", "B0056OZI0M", "B005ZMBEXU", "B007S0DCUU", "B00CDSILB2", "B008FIPRGG", "B00BTFK014", "B005E7SEZW", "B0056OZHZS", "B00FLCYIAA", "B001L67A4G", "B0000U0X1Q", "B0018PH3NS", "B00C3ALL9O", "B0058M0848", "B006JD48GY", "B000BNXD6Y", "B000I0RNWU", "B001AZIRWW", "B004P8R9O8", "B000FELD8Y", "B003OXGW5M", "B006UTDH6O", "B0087AOYG6", "B00393SFTS", "B005M9VSMI", "B004U7MR0K", "B004I1AGTC", "B003YOZNFQ", "B003NLE5JA", "B0010SAGHS", "B0089BSO8C", "B004H2CXBQ", "B00518HB4O", "B00H47IXJW", "B005KG4CUS", "B000MM0LE6", "B00003CXR4", "B001BEK8HO", "B0013D8LCM", "B0076XTIWU", "B003LN0NXC", "B005DKS1TE", "B0054EKDEU", "B000WGZGOC", "B00EI3Y1QO", "B003INBNXO", "B00518HBAI", "B00004STDA", "B00EI3XAZC"], "bought_together": ["B002C6VMIY", "B001MEJY9G"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001MEJY9G", "B00104AYGK", "B000ICLU7C", "B0019PL2W0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 37716}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.21, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B000683VH0", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510MAF5FwPL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Warriors of Heaven and Earth"}

{"description": "Broadcast on TNT in July 2004,The Gridis an ambitious, often-gripping miniseries depicting the battle against terrorism in a post-9/11 world.  When a terrorist cell's sarin attack in London backfires, an unusual and sometimes-uneasy partnership is formed to anticipate and prevent the next strike.  The team consists of counterterrorism analysts and agents from the National Security Council (Julianna Margulies), the FBI (Dylan McDermott), the CIA (Peter Marek), and Britain's MI-5 (Bernard Hill) and MI-6 (Jemma Redgrave).  Gradually unfolding over six parts and four and a half hours, the BBC-Fox TV coproduction travels across North America, the Middle East, Europe, and Africa following not only the professional and personal lives of the \"good guys,\" but also the terrorists' stories.  Comparisons will inevitably be drawn betweenThe Gridand24(especially considering the latter's terrorism story lines in seasons 2 and 3).The Gridcan't compete in terms of sheer thrills, but it's a well-shot, well-cast ensemble drama with an exciting conclusion that takes place simultaneously on three continents.The two-DVD set is supplemented by a commentary track by director Mikael Solomon and executive producer Tracey Alexander on two episodes, commentary by Margulies on specific scenes from two episodes, commentary by McDermott on specific scenes from two episodes, 13 deleted scenes, and three featurettes.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000CR7RCK", "B000L43PGQ", "B000N3T0EG", "B000O77SOK", "B003VBR5YO", "B002TQKL7A", "B000FS9MY2", "B002DQSKME", "B0051GOB2G", "B003LXM1B4", "B000FOPPBA", "B0080QOK16", "B003PGNBO8", "B001OQCVCE", "B001MVYUP2", "B000FJH5M2", "B000MMMTD2", "B0002S94BQ", "B00CMDPT68", "B001RXDM2M", "B000E5N6B6", "B0037AGB9O", "B000E3L7F0", "B00AHREQMY", "B00KHA99BY", "B0083HXKAY", "B00B5A9FNM", "B001QE99BA", "B002MVI3HC", "B002FLOTPE", "B003LXM1PK", "B00D7AM2YW", "B004P7CNEA", "B00BX8PG4S", "B000KF0DVQ", "B000EOTV98", "B00BUEWKNK", "B0009JE6G6", "B00006RCL0", "B00BCXW106", "B0001AVZAS", "B003ZE73GW", "B00BD6KXKW", "B00BQXTCVS", "B0000E32UZ", "B000FIHN8O", "B007PKSO2Y", "B000S8CLR4", "B00DW5IKN4", "B0081QF6Q8", "B00HUCF420", "B0055SNHQG", "B00HNGC516", "B00CD45JBG", "B000E8JO2S", "B000YW8RPE", "B008I34YEE", "B00GWXI28Q", "B0019Z3P84", "B0006GAO36", "B002AMVEJ2", "B004TJ1GY2", "B00ECXJC1E", "B001NXDIMK", "B00JJRLFTU", "B00D49YBTA", "B00CKJJ1G8", "B00J5LXT44", "B0013BDQ42", "B003R4ZMQI", "B0013NAMLU", "B000CNE0RO", "B00C57OVUQ", "B00GD7UO6E", "B008RO6PJQ", "B0002S94C0", "B001A7GOCA", "B003VA3JZO", "B005JX89WY", "B009SCOHSW", "B00ECGHM5O", "B00GD7UMDO", "B00116W26M", "B00HW3ELGW", "B00AQYUY5Q", "B0010X746O", "B00CRX82LM", "B004AUCDLU", "B000YRY8BG", "B0011VJRVU", "B001CY5N00", "B0001WTUK8", "B00E3V9N1E", "B0024FAR66", "B00CLB7CFM", "B00020HB3W", "B00AO1RJOU", "B00028HOMM", "B00915G6R6", "B000IJ7AEC"], "bought_together": ["B000CR7RCK", "B000L43PGQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000CR7RCK", "B000L43PGQ", "B000FS9MY2", "B0051GOB2G"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 27806}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 16.93, "brand": "MCDERMOTT,DYLAN", "asin": "B0006GAO4A", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51C407PC5CL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Grid"}

{"description": "While 2003'sDaredevilwas a conventional superhero movie, the 2005 spinoff,Elektra, is more of awuxia-styled martial arts/fantasy flick. Elektra (Jennifer Garner) has returned to her life as a hired assassin, but she balks at an assignment to kill a single father (Goran Visnjic,ER) and his teenage daughter (Kirsten Prout). That makes her the target of the Hand, an organization of murderous ninjas, scheming corporate types, and a band of stylish supervillains seeking to eliminate Elektra and tip the balance of power in the ongoing battle of good vs. evil.As the star ofAlias, Garner has proven that she can kick butt with the best of them, and some of the visual effects are impressive, but the action sequences tend to be anticlimactic, and there's not much to the story. Fans will notice numerous references toFrank Miller's comic books, but there's very little resemblance to Miller's cold-blooded killer (Elektra with an agent? Elektra referring to herself as a \"soccer mom\"?).IsElektrabetter thanDaredevil? Not really, even with the distinct advantage of having all Garner and no Ben Affleck. That could be the spinoff's greatest disappointment: afterSpider-Man 2raised the bar for comic-book movies,Elektralowered it back toDaredevil's level.  Directed by Rob Bowman (theX-Filesmovie), and featuring Terence Stamp as the mysterious mentor Stick, Will Yun Lee (Die Another Day) as the chief villain, and NFL-player-turned-mixed-martial-arts-champion Bob Sapp as the immovable Stone.DVD featuresBen Affleck's much-rumored cameo is one of the deleted scenes on theElektraDVD.  It's a one-minute throwaway, and while he's supposedly appearing as Matt Murdock (who romanced Elektra inDaredevil), the barrage of celebrity gossip makes it impossible to see him as anything other than Jennifer Garner's real-life boyfriend.  There's also a making-of featurette, which is mostly promotional hype other than a few interesting effects shots; four editing featurettes; and Jennifer Garner's videotaped message to ComicCon.--David HoriuchiMore onElektraElektra: The Album(Soundtrack CD)Elektra: The Movie(Comic Adaptation)Frank Miller Comic BooksDaredevil(Director's Cut) (DVD)Jennifer Garner stars inAlias(DVD)More Superhero DVDs", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000959N0", "B000VI70QS", "B00005JNTU", "B0006L0LOS", "B000FGGE68", "B001QB9H1U", "B001CDR1FG", "B000OVLBF8", "B00AEFXCLU", "B0002IQMAM", "B005LAIGW8", "B001DHXT20", "B004EPZ07K", "B001F7MSFM", "B001GCUO1Q", "B0009A409S", "B008JFUS0U", "B002GSXKNI", "B00E5I2MEK", "B004LWZW42", "B0007V6ITE", "B000UR9T8C", "B001AK3S4Y", "B00K7IPFSM", "B00E5I2MCM", "078401132X", "B00E5I2M9K", "B00005JM5B", "B0090SI56Y", "B00005JKWJ", "B004LWZWFQ", "B0002KVUKM", "B000HCO83Q", "B003YOZNBU", "B000J10EQU", "B00003CXZ1", "B00E5I2M6I", "B000AYELVU", "B00005JMQW", "B008JFUO72", "B003Y5H5EW", "B000HEVZ9E", "B000AYELVA", "B000VI28Z6", "B00JL6L4UY", "B009MO57H6", "B00AEFYGBA", "B002ZG99B8", "B0083SBMBM", "B001CC7PKS", "B00005JKCH", "B0007WFX62", "B0006IIPIK", "6307397594", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B0009MDPYM", "B001OQCVI8", "B00JPS7HOA", "0780624890", "B00F4FFO8E", "B002GSXKN8", "B008JFUPFI", "B00IKM5LXG", "B00177Y9ZC", "B003YAR97K", "B002ZG98UA", "B002NXSRVG", "B000EQHXN2", "B001RHGRT8", "B00IZZDWKM", "B001GZ6QC4", "B004LWZWGA", "B0021L8V0M", "B000VR0570", "1558908846", "B001HN697M", "B00005JLYW", "B008JFURII", "B001MVWRNE", "B001FB55HQ", "B005LAII44", "B00A2H9OSK", "B001QTXM5Y", "B002ZG983M", "B00BTYMPUY", "B002U4UZSQ", "B001QB9H2E", "B002ZG99G8", "B005G4TJUC", "B0012RLX88", "B003Q6D2B4", "B00195FUDC", "B008Y1YK9Y", "B001OQCUZM", "B00HMVJB0K", "B002ZG98N2", "B00005JNJV", "B004SIP9Z6", "B000K7UBSO", "B00HEPDGKA"], "bought_together": ["B0002XVQNU", "B000VI70QS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005JLXE", "B0090SI56Y", "B00979KQAO", "B000VI28Z6"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 23534}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.99, "brand": "TCFHE", "asin": "B0007P0Y7C", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51R5W%2BoU9CL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Elektra (Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "Venom, the scariest and most memorable villain from Spider-Man's post-Stan Lee era, takes center stage in this collection of five episodes (\"The Alien Costume\" parts 1-3, \"Venom Returns,\" and \"Carnage\") from theSpider-Mananimated series from the mid-'90s.  The action begins when astronaut John Jameson discovers a strange new substance on the moon.  The substance ends up becoming a new black costume for Spider-Man, and he's thrilled with the way it enhances his natural powers (such as spinning webs without mechanical web shooters) and can change into a different outfit merely upon a thought.  Spidey soon discovers, however, that the apparent costume is actually an alien symbiote that is gradually taking control of his thoughts.  Spidey is able to overcome the symbiote, but it finds a new host inDaily Buglewashout Eddie Brock, and their mutual hatred of Spider-Man creates a deadly new villain, Venom, whose natural powers exceed Spidey's.  Things get even more complicated when Venom's \"offspring\" finds a host and becomes the even deadlier Carnage.  Also making appearances in these episodes are the Kingpin, the Shocker, the Rhino, Dormammu, Iron Man, and War Machine.  DVD features include some interesting comments by David Michelinie, who with artist Todd MacFarlane, created Venom in the comic books.  Among other topics in the unnecessarily complicated feature, he discusses differences between the show and the comics.  Stan Lee also boards his soap box to dish about Venom (11 minutes) and has optional introductions for each episode.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00006II6Q", "B0001I55N8", "B0000633UA", "B00007G205", "B0000VCZLG", "B001QIVEVE", "B002A5EBLW", "B0036EH3XO", "B001QIVEVO", "B002DYKPF6", "B0036EH3XY", "B002O5M4SK", "B002DYKPFQ", "B002WY65TM", "B001T6KW4I", "B001OXLGJG", "B0007US7CQ", "B0037FFBPO", "B002WY65TC", "B00IGVJH0E", "B001OXLGJ6", "B00A4DML6E", "B0025AY3X8", "B001KP2J2Q", "B000089G5S", "B0001XAOGG", "B0001I55O2", "B003XTUAHS", "B004MYYHG8", "B002WNUVK2", "B002YOKVUY", "B00D97DLYS", "B00023E894", "B000YDBP84", "B00HMOW9YM", "B00HXH00YE", "B00HRUQ8S4", "B004MYYHGI", "B00157OI9Q", "B00172T0VU", "B007549WKI", "B002JUFPXG", "B00A8GBVOK", "0785124985", "B00JL6L4UY", "B000PFSYO4", "0785156771", "B0088I29W8", "B005BXY1RE", "B007IKKSNY", "B000A59PLU", "B005BXY1PG", "B008FYZHLK", "B00CENSU1W", "B001614E68", "B00J8LXD60", "B0007XG43W", "B005CSYQ2S", "B002FGUHBE", "B00GD9GNEY", "B000B7QCHC", "B002AWC7NO", "0785166939", "B000PE0G0A", "B0009UZG28", "B00005JKCH", "B00005JMQW", "B000UR9T8C", "0785115242", "B0002ZMHWM", "B000FP2YYA", "B0001XAOG6", "B000Q66PX4", "B003Z8ZCDO", "0785110879", "B005SH63HO", "B00IJS2OHM", "0785151133", "B0001XAOFW", "B001LK8SQ6", "B002LWJ510", "0785161244", "B000087F7J", "B000CSTK42", "B000CEXFZ6", "B0083K11KC", "B00GZ0ML4C", "0785110941", "B0009JB4IY", "B000TSTEMS", "B00C6OLH0U", "B003UN2ICM", "B000A9QKLE", "B001QB9H1U", "B00GJ6HQDI", "B00004TBGT", "B000OPODNG", "B00CUWXG9I"], "bought_together": ["B00006II6Q", "B0001I55N8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001QIVEVE", "B002DYKPF6", "B001QIVEVO", "B002DYKPFQ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 51314}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 10.25, "brand": "Walt Disney Studios", "asin": "B0007RT9MG", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518MPQK604L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Spider-Man: The Venom Saga"}

{"description": "Every October 31 pint-sized ghouls and goblins wander through neighborhoods knocking on doors and asking for treats . . . little do they know they're actually carrying out an ancient tradition dating back thousands of years.  Join Harry Smith of CBS's The Early Show as he leads this 3000-year expedition through the history of the characteristically pagan holiday of Halloween. Discover how the \"trick-or-treat\" custom originated during the harvest festivals in ancient Ireland when food and sweets were used to coax the dead into remaining in the spirit world.

{"description": "Law & Order's third year marked a transitional one for the top-rated drama. In 1992, Jerry Orbach (Prince of the City) joined the cast. His Det. Lenny Briscoe would turn out to be one of its most enduring characters. After Sgt. Phil Ceretta (Paul Sorvino) is shot by a gun dealer in episode eight (\"Prince of Darkness\"), Briscoe teams up with Det. Mike Logan (Chris Noth) in the next (\"Point of View\"). It wasn't meant to be a permanent change (Ceretta was injured, not killed), but the two would continue to beat the streets until Logan's departure in 1995 (Orbach, meanwhile, would remain part of theLaw & Orderuniverse until his passing in 2004).The line-up was otherwise the same: Capt. Donald Craven (Dann Florek), ADA Paul Robinette (Richard Brooks), ADA Benjamin Stone (Michael Moriarty), and DA Adam Schiff (Steven Hill). In the following season, however, Craven will be replaced by Lt. Anita Van Buren (S. Epatha Merkerson), the show's first regular female character (not counting Carolyn McCormick, who was billed as a featured player). The third season would also be Robinette's last; he will be replaced by Claire Kinkaid (Jill Hennessy) in the fourth. Meanwhile, Florek would go on to joinLaw & Order: Special Victims Unitin 1999 (while Noth would joinLaw & Order: Criminal Intentin 2005).DuringLaw & Order's third season, a number of soon-to-be-famous TV actors would put in appearances. They include Lauren Ambrose (Six Feet Under), Claire Danes (My So-Called Life), Felicity Huffman (Desperate Housewives), Edie Falco and Vincent Pastore (The Sopranos), Adam Arkin (Chicago Hope), Michael Badalucco and Camryn Manheim (The Practice), Ron Rifkin (Alias), and Julianna Margulies (E.R.).

{"description": "Here's some grisly good news for fear fans: the first season of HBO's long-running TV horror anthologyTales from the Crypt, based on the notorious '50s-era E.C. comic books, emerges on DVD in a two-disc set that's sure to have 'em shrieking (with joy, of course). Shepherded by a host of top Hollywood producers and directors (including Joel Silver, Richard Donner, Robert Zemeckis, and Walter Hill), theTales from the Cryptseries brought together major talent both in front of and behind the camera to give life to E.C.'s over-the-top stories of gruesome revenge and ghastly terror. Season 1 offers six star-studded spooktaculars, including Donner's \"Dig That Cat&#x85; He's Real Gone,\" withThe Sopranos' Joe Pantoliano as a carnival performer with a knack for surviving horrible endings; Zemeckis's \"And All Through the House,\" with Larry Drake as a homicidal Santa Claus terrorizing a woman who has just killed her husband (this story was also adapted in the 1972 theatrical version ofCrypt); and Hill's \"The Man Who Was Death,\" featuring a topnotch performance by William Sadler as a jailhouse executioner who takes the law into his own hands. Comic purists may decry liberties taken by updating the original stories (and current audiences may find elements in some episodes out of date, most notably Mary Lambert's \"Only Sin Deep\"), but the blend of gore and black humor should keep most horror heads happy, as should the chattering presence of the animatronic Crypt Keeper (well-voiced by John Kassir), who serves as the show's ghost host.The two-disc set's chief extra is an interesting documentary about the original comics, featuring interviews with co-editor Al Feldstein and legendary artist Jack Davis, as well as directors and authors inspired by the comics like George Romero, John Carpenter, and R.L. Stine. The Crypt Keeper also weighs in with a new intro for the DVD, as well as his reminiscences of the first-season episodes, complete with plenty of behind-the-scenes production photos. In short, pleasant screams are ensured for all.--Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000A88EU0", "B000E1MXWS", "B000FFJYC0", "B000P0J0E2", "B000SULWKO", "B000GYI322", "B003NKU9XM", "B006BZ8NSE", "B001LM64VA", "B002GHHHG0", "B00L89VL96", "B000RXVNCO", "B000Q66Q56", "B002HK9HZU", "B004SUDQCW", "B0053TWV46", "B00BTYPW7C", "B003VJTGMU", "B00363WGIM", "B0000AOX0C", "B002JHD9D2", "B000N2HD6Y", "B00AGKH714", "B00005JOJE", "B0000AOX0B", "B00HRCBGRA", "B00AEBB91O", "B003VJTGNE", "B0007CEXUY", "B000IMUYJM", "B000FFJZO2", "B00013D54Y", "B002EP8FDI", "B0007WQHI0", "157347049X", "B00005UQ9I", "B002XD0J80", "B0009YCLBS", "B002LMSWN2", "B000RIWAV2", "B00CBFB8WG", "B0024FAG44", "6305972001", "B00006FDCD", "B0002O7XW2", "B000I2J68M", "B000WC3864", "B001DXS4DI", "B0002VYOVS", "B000GYI340", "B000RIWAVW", "B00ARWX9NG", "B000053UIF", "1573625779", "B002I41KNC", "B001B8XRT6", "B00HRUQB8Q", "B00006FDCU", "6305645574", "B00BCMT1PK", "B001B1UO6W", "B00005KH30", "B00GSMZ3I8", "B000RL21N6", "B00005N5RM", "B00HRUQ8X4", "B009IV2Z7S", "B000068IEV", "B009IV2Z3M", "B005J9ZFQG", "B003PIUINI", "B008DVJOQ4", "B00009PY4G", "B000V4UFZK", "B0002NY8XA", "B000000HQ1", "B0053TWVIM", "B000CR76U8", "B0000694WL", "B000FEBWTE", "B000IFQLLE", "B004KDYR20", "B000Q66Q8I", "B00005O439", "B000WC389G", "B0002IQLH6", "B008R52L3Y", "B0001ZX0GK", "B0009X7650", "B00A429Y56", "B008JFUNYG", "B0002S9QUA", "B002K0WBX2", "B000U1ZV6W", "B003VE9WP6", "B00919THZU", "B000ERVJNG", "B00DOZNGTK", "B00009MEC4"], "bought_together": ["B000A88EU0", "B000E1MXWS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0030E5PYO", "B003NKU9XM", "B000A88EU0", "B006BZ8NSE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 85757}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 10.0, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B0009ETCOW", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51D2iWduZFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Tales from the Crypt: Season 1"}
{"description": "After the romantic courtship and the awkwardness of first dates,Once and Againin its second season settled into charting the growing relationship between fortysomethings Lily (Sela Ward) and Rick (Billy Campbell), who finally shook off all their angst and family pressures to embark on a long-term relationship. And of course, once finally committed in their love for each other, life rudely interrupts what should have been a comfortable, winding road to happily ever after. Rick's architecture firm is hand-picked for a new high-profile project, but it's dogged by community protests and run by the ever-devious Miles Drentell (David Clennon, reprising his shady character fromthirtysomething); what's more, Rick's ex-wife, Karen (Susanna Thompson), is the lawyer representing the project's opposition. Lily finds herself as the assistant to a twentysomething entrepreneur at a fledgling dot-com, and the victim of the amorous, non-professional interests of a consultant for the troubled company. She's also faced with the fate of her late father's restaurant, run by her ex-husband, Jake (Jeffrey Nordling), who's charming but not the best of businessmen, and his financial strain soon becomes hers as well. Oh, and then there are the kids: Rick's son Eli (Shane West) would rather start a band than go to college, and daughter Jessie (Evan Rachel Wood) may be anorexic; Lily's daughter Grace (Julia Whelan) falls into a friendship with a troubled girl, and only Zoe (Meredith Deane) seems to be the most normal--that is, when she isn't worried about Rick and his kids moving into her house.The course of true love never did run smooth, and truth be told, there were a bit too many plot twists cooked up for this season of the Edward Zwick-Marshall Herskovitz drama (including a hostage episode at Jake's restaurant that garnered high ratings), but the creative team behind this show managed a deft balancing act among all the characters and plotlines. Teenage angst co-existed alongside more adult worries, and the specter of professional and money troubles for both Rick and Lily kept the characters grounded in a reality not often seen in television dramas. And in addition to giving all the cast members shining moments,Once and Againdeveloped an extensive number of secondary characters, including Lily's mentally ill brother Aaron (Patrick Dempsey), Jake's flighty girlfriend Tiffany (Ever Carradine), Karen's hunky younger boyfriend (Mark Feuerstein), and an uncredited Edward Zwick as Jessie's therapist. It was the core cast, however, that madeOnce and Againsoar--teen actors West and Whelan broke their characters' stereotypical molds, the young Wood (who would go on to star inthirteen) was outstanding as she navigated blooming adolescence: Nordling and Thompson, as the exes on the periphery, were two of the best supporting actors ever on television. As always, though, Ward and Campbell were the show's heart and soul, always communicating the underlying waves of frustration and anger in their character's facades as well as the love and happiness. Despite low ratings, ABC renewedOnce and Againfor a third and final season, giving all us fans of great television (and hopeless romantics) one more year with Rick and Lily after this one.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JLFY", "B001U9BS2O", "B00JF5GAZA", "B00FR23O4U", "B00GTZWU7G", "B00GUOJJUW", "B00BGQ2NIO", "B002NN7EXS", "B00127RAGM", "B0035CVB2Q", "B001VPJYZU", "B003L77FY8", "B0077PTWHI", "B00BGQ2NDO", "B000R7HRRA", "B0018CWEVW", "B0077PTWY6", "B009LDD5MM"], "bought_together": ["B00005JLFY", "B001U9BS2O"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005JLFY", "B001U9BS2O", "B000P6YNT8", "B00BMKGZVA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 58208}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 99.99, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B0009F43FY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514900S20HL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Once and Again - The Complete Second Season"}

As worlds collide, the consequences will threaten not only Jack and Rose's way of life but also their unusually close bond. *1989: Actor, My Left Foot.", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783227329", "B000CBG5PG", "0783227906", "B004U7MR1Y", "B004499LWG", "B001FB55OE", "B00013F2S6", "B00B5A9FL4", "B00AEBB9CS", "B004SIP7TE", "B00008R9KF", "B000A2WP7O", "B004TWP6YA", "B00B5A9FP0", "B002YMWQ9U", "B00005221M", "B00H9HZITU", "B00005V1WP", "B0001DCYUU", "B002VECLVO", "B00004Y87L", "B00005JLRE", "B000KX0IP4", "0783230559", "B00003CWTI", "B000Y5CHIE", "B00000G02H", "B0007US7EY", "B000F6IOAM", "B002WY65VA", "B007701RFS", "B007HOQ5GU", "B00AEBBAEU", "B00008972R", "B00G7QPXUI", "6302800595", "B003UESJLU", "B004SIP7US", "B00GAXASK8", "B00G4Q3KOC", "B007TBJUVS", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B00007K02D", "B0020LH8WU", "B001FB55OO", "B00GUO2SKA", "B009AMANBA", "B0011V7PSC", "B002ZG99EK", "B0007P0YKY", "B00GMV8L1Q", "B002LVVCJY", "B00FRILRYS", "B00GMV8LIO", "B000E33VWW", "B00005U14H", "B003Y5H4W0", "B00006RCNV", "B0039PGHB4", "B0045HCJ8U", "B0008KLVA0", "B00000K31T", "B00008L3U6", "B000PAAJZ6", "B0009A40EI", "B00GMV8M2Y", "B009W21N7G", "B0007PALGG", "B000N4SHOO", "B002ZG99IG", "B001DJ7PR8", "B0080QOL10", "B00006LSFR", "6305428239", "B004EQAVHI", "B00AEFYCL4", "B0014GI6I2", "B000GG4Y32", "B000EQHXNW", "B008OTTTP6", "0571211755", "B009POCG0Y", "B008220DGE", "B00003CXBU", "B00782O7NE", "B00005K3NR", "B005LAIGY6", "B0001H0PC0", "B00005R1MJ", "B002VWNICC", "B002AMUDQM", "B00103HGIK"], "bought_together": ["0783227329", "B00013F2S6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0783227329", "0783227906", "B000CBG5PG", "B004499LWG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 177918}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.28, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B0009VRHNI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DFNBH6DNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Ballad of Jack and Rose"}

{"description": "A South Korean thriller based on a true story,Memories of Murdercomes across like a hybrid ofSilence of the LambsandOne False Move. A pair of rural detectives, Park (Song Kang-ho) and Jo (Kim Roe-ha), chafe when a Seoul detective named Seo (Kim Sang-kyung) gets involved in their big case: Korea's first known serial killer, who's killed two women on rainy nights. Seo is dismayed by the rural cops'  interrogation methods, which consist of beating suspects until they confess--and they aren't above planting evidence or \"helping\" a suspect remember the details of his crime. While Park and Jo seek clues from fortune tellers and magic charms, Seo struggles to build a case from hard evidence and the forensic approaches only just starting to take hold (the movie is set in 1986). Shots of the victims and jolting moments of violence giveMemories of Murdera dose of gruesomeness, but the movie has more on its mind that exploitation.

{"description": "Movie studios, by and large, avoid controversial subjects like race the way you might avoid a hive of angry bees. So it's remarkable thatCrasheven got made; that it's a rich, intelligent, and moving exploration of the interlocking lives of a dozen Los Angeles residents--black, white, latino, Asian, and Persian--is downright amazing. A politically nervous district attorney (Brendan Fraser) and his high-strung wife (Sandra Bullock, biting into a welcome change of pace fromMiss Congeniality) get car-jacked by an oddly sociological pair of young black men (Larenz Tate and Chris \"Ludacris\" Bridges); a rich black T.V. director (Terrence Howard) and his wife (Thandie Newton) get pulled over by a white racist cop (Matt Dillon) and his reluctant partner (Ryan Phillipe); a detective (Don Cheadle) and his Latina partner and lover (Jennifer Esposito) investigate a white cop who shot a black cop--these are only three of the interlocking stories that reach up and down class lines. Writer/director Paul Haggis (who wrote the screenplay forMillion Dollar Baby) spins every character in unpredictable directions, refusing to let anyone sink into a stereotype. The cast--ranging from the famous names above to lesser-known but just as capable actors like Michael Pena (Buffalo Soldiers) and Loretta Devine (Woman Thou Art Loosed)--meets the strong script head-on, delivering galvanizing performances in short vignettes, brief glimpses that build with gut-wrenching force.

{"description": "Like the previous entries in theLooney Tunes Golden Collectionseries, volume 3 confirms how brilliant the Warner Bros. artists were and how durable their creations have proven. The set includes classics that every cartoon buff will recognize: \"Duck! Rabbit! Duck!,\" \"Robin Hood Daffy,\" \"Birds Anonymous.\" Other selections are less familiar but significant in the development of the studio: \"Sinkin' in the Bathtub,\" the first Looney Tune; \"I Haven't Got a Hat,\" the earliest Warners cartoon viewers can watch for fun, rather than as an historic curiosity; \"Porky's Romance,\" in which director Frank Tashlin introduced rapid cutting to cartoons. Some of the caricature films have aged less gracefully. Younger audiences will recognize the drawn versions of W.C. Fields, the Marx Brothers, Katharine Hepburn, and Charlie Chaplin. But will anyone under the age of 60 remember Edna Mae Oliver, George Arliss, or Ned Sparks?The producers have once again loaded the discs with supplemental material, including \"Point Food Rationing,\" a unseen short explaining wartime ration books; a BBC documentary on Chuck Jones; and interstitial animated sequences forThe Bugs Bunny Show. \"Philbert\" ranks as the oddest of the extras: an unsold (and leaden) pilot from 1963, featuring live actors and an animated title character. Whoopi Goldberg introduces the set, explaining that some of the ethnic gags would no longer be considered appropriate. But she correctly adds that to remove them would falsify both the history of animation and American popular culture. It all adds up to a set every cartoon fan will want.

{"description": "In its prime,Roseannewas the most honest reflection of American life ever shown on television--and also one of the funniest. The second season of this essential sitcom, built around former standup comedian Roseanne Barr, was perhaps its best. The sterling cast--which featured John Goodman (Raising Arizona,Matinee) as Roseanne's husband Dan; Laurie Metcalf (Dear God) as her sister Jackie; and Lecy Goranson, Sara Gilbert, and Michael Fishman as Becky, Darlene, and D.J., her three kids--were confident and eagerly stretching themselves. The writers (including Joss Whedon, later to createBuffy the Vampire SlayerandFirefly) knew how to write smart but credible dialogue and stories; in one episode, Darlene writes a poem that sounds exactly like a 13 year old girl's poetry, yet squeezes your heart. Watch almost any other sitcom and then watchRoseanne; it's startling how much more naturalRoseannefeels.In the season opener, Becky passes gas in front her classmates at school; but that in itself isn't half as funny as the glee that Darlene takes in describing the event--the kind of viciousness that only real families can cultivate. That's the key toRoseanne's success: The utter believability of the relationships. Dan and Roseanne are a loving couple, but their affection works because their fights are just as potent as their flirting. The relationship between Roseanne and Jackie became particularly strong in this season, as Roseanne fought against Jackie's desire to become a cop and meddled in her relationship with her short-lived fiance Gary (Brian Kerwin); Roseanne and Metcalf developed an interplay that could be caring, playful, and bitterly jealous--and sometimes all three at once. The daily urge of parents to both coddle and strangle their kids was thoroughly explored, as was the fusion of need and contempt children feel for their parents. There is one misstep: A dream episode in which Roseanne goes on trial smacks of star ego in a way the show is normally careful to avoid--and makes clear how sharp the other episodes are. The extras are paltry, but this isn't a collection you get for the frills; the show itself lives up to its reputation.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0058J3S16", "B007C8RZJW", "B007C8RZYC", "B008L0YMUK", "B008L0YN6I", "B00B04NJ12", "B00B04NIOU", "B00BUWD7SO", "B005BIGAL4", "B005ENCIXU", "B008XJM8ZU", "B00BUWD7E8", "B0002W4SX6", "B0007KTBJO", "B0002W4SWW", "B00LBHOCHS", "B000AJJNJK", "B0001ZMWXW", "B000I2J6VE", "B0007US79Y", "B0009YCLBS", "B0007R4SWC", "B0058JEHTS", "B000C1VBAA", "B00GLT2SOA", "B000AJJNIQ", "B000FBH3WC", "B000EBGFQI", "B004D2GMVM", "B000KGGIL4", "B00DJYK1XU", "B0001BS3IY", "B000EYK4H6", "B00000F5W8", "B0058JEHSO", "B000BNTM46", "B00I458456", "B0006J27WY", "B0002NY81M", "B007C8RZQ0", "B000A7PKGW", "B00GOC75YW", "B0000CGNEC", "B00009Y3RW", "B00070HK4C", "B000ENUYG8", "B00008NV4G", "B00GOC74YI", "B0002RQ3MK", "B000640WGM", "B000EHSVKK", "B00D2UMHSI", "B000I2J6W8", "B000EQ45BU", "B0007YXRCW", "B00008AOX3", "B000957O8C", "B0002I838Q", "B000SQFC0O", "B000ND91OA", "B006MFQ4DE", "B00D2UMHB0", "B002E58FT2", "B0001EFV9K", "B008L0YMZA", "B002E58FTW", "B000GRUMQY", "B0001NBNJ8", "B0000AKY3Q", "B0000C9JFQ", "B008L3650M", "B000286S42", "B000FBH3WM", "B000QUTTPG", "B0009I7NH6", "B000EHSVL4", "B000E6ESBW", "B000QFCDAO", "B0007ZSHR6", "B0001907BW", "B0030Y12AA", "B0077T2Z8C", "B0009X7BF0", "B007C8RZL0", "B0000E5NPY", "B0001Z3I1C", "B0009JQN6M", "B000NA1W3Q", "B004MCGNT4", "B000QFCDAY", "B001GP5TMW", "B000E6ESA8", "B004MWLXTY", "B000M341S2", "B00005JOHC", "B002E58FUG", "B008VNI9TC", "B0015XWU9A", "B001OXLGIC"], "bought_together": ["B0058J3S16", "B007C8RZJW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00BUWD7E8", "B0058J3S16", "B007C8RZJW", "B007C8RZYC"]}, "price": 24.28, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 160147}, "asin": "B000BBOFFE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5187HTJBAFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Roseanne: Season 2"}
{"description": "Life in the Freezeris a startling portrait of Antarctica as a dramatic, violent, yet ultimately poetic ecosystem. It's also a miraculously beautiful documentary that can stir an armchair adventurer, make one wish to be standing alongside host David Attenborough as he gazes at the dream-like enormity of glaciers (\"glass-yeers,\" as Attenborough pronounces it) or visits one of the pristine, Georgian islands where seabirds flock during Antarctica's version of spring and summer. With its frozen mass subject to cyclical expansions and retractions, Antarctica's changes determine the feeding, mating, and habitat patterns of a wide variety of wildlife.Life in the Freezer's multi-episode format allows each of those changes to be explored in rich detail. Attenborough demonstrates why certain birds migrate to Antarctica at the same time that humpback and killer whales show up to feed on swarms of shrimp-like krill. In some of the most amazing footage in the series, bull elephant seals appear on Antarctica's shores to manage their harems, mate as often as possible, and brutally fight to keep competitors away. As for penguins: they march, they partner up, they stand still in sub-zero snowstorms. But they also end up as seal prey (a darkly comic sight) and vault through sea waves like mythic heroes. This 1993 series is something special, easily surpassingMarch of the Penguinsas a vision of life in the harshest environment on Earth.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000XCK0MS", "B000EBD9W6", "B0018F0QS2", "B000069HXL", "B000BI5KV0", "B0012YN5AK", "B001W79MRW", "B005SH65TK", "B00005JPXA", "B004PHSTWK", "B00FRQ0BA6", "B002EWD0CW", "B00AKIPA52", "B001957A4E", "B000R7I4A4", "B003ONR2WE", "B002BEXDXY", "B0039UTDA6", "B000M2E354", "B00005JMXX", "B0012YN5A0", "B0014VPFQI", "B00ANDPGGW", "B007C8RZWO", "B009M4KSGG", "B000N3SSA8", "0958291632", "B001DWNUD8", "B0016I0AH8", "6305211981", "B0014VPFRM", "B0000ADXEB", "B00FRQ0GA6", "6305291470", "B004PHSTZ2", "B003ONR38C", "B000MR9D5E", "B00005JM2Y", "B004PQM814", "B005SH65UO", "B00BBXTS94", "B001W79MQS", "B000OPOCH8", "B00DJ44M80", "B0000687GJ", "B004CRR9FG", "B00BNADYT0", "B000ICL3KG", "B0031SZEQ8", "B004K4FUWU", "B006US3UQC", "B005OAEWV4", "B004CRR9I8", "B0000CBXZZ", "B00GBBDNCO", "B00013F2S6", "B004IF4EXW", "B00ANDGYQS", "B000BI5KUQ", "B000AJJNMM", "B00GSDSRQW", "B00GSDSQDQ", "1554072743", "B00AK7806E", "B000T28PWY", "B001P7YDAK", "B0037X5BME", "B009NRQTKQ", "B0012Q3T7W", "B004PQM80K", "B0000AC8LI", "1741794595", "B0043SS2DC", "B00406UJVU", "B00B5AAW6G", "B002UXRGM0", "B003NF97OE", "B000H5U61G", "B000BNTMK0", "1426304269", "B001UGJUQS", "B002EWD0D6", "B0042HOQ02", "B0000AISJC", "B000M2E34U", "B0016I0AI2", "B0043SS2EQ", "B000ROA01S", "B000V6LSU4", "B005Z2D88O", "9020979779", "B000JJ5F8O", "B000BB1MI2", "B000056OZ5", "0061198587", "B006ZYCH2E", "B00022PYZM", "B000KX0IN6", "B004ITYDTI", "B0028ERBSA"], "bought_together": ["B000BI5KV0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000BI5KV0", "B005SH65TK", "B000069HXL", "B000EBD9W6"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 21107}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 11.97, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B000BJS4FS", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51SP3391DYL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Life in the Freezer"}
{"description": "The teaming of Johnny Knoxville (Jackass: The Movie) and Seann William Scott (Dude, Where's My Car?) as well as the presence of the '70s-flavored car chases that were a specialty of the TV series guarantees thatThe Dukes of Hazzardwill be even more lowbrow than the CBS TV series (1979-85) that inspired it. However, this brain-damaging comedy is more \"rehash\" than \"remake,\" as good ol' Georgia boys Luke Duke (Knoxville) and his cousin Bo (Scott) are frequently upstaged by the General Lee, the Confederate-flagged '69 Charger that they drive, jump, race, and fly in as they smuggle moonshine for their Uncle Jesse (Willie Nelson). Meanwhile, cousin Daisy Duke (Jessica Simpson) is reliably available to model her short-shorts (aka \"Daisy Dukes\") and awesome figure (and let's face it, Simpson's talents pretty much begin and end right there), while corrupt honcho Boss Hogg (Burt Reynolds, who should know better) recruits a local NASCAR star to advance his wily scheme of converting Hazzard County into a strip mine. Director Jay Chandrasekhar (Super Troopers) manages to mine some good-natured humor from the movie's oval-track detour and a few colorful supporting players (notably Kevin Hefferman as the Duke's pal Sheev). Otherwise, consider yourself warned:The Dukes of Hazzardis shameless Hollywood product at its most forgettable, trafficking in shameless white, rural Southern stereotypes.

{"description": "One of the more exciting and atmospheric TV adaptations of a popular comic book series,The Flashbenefited from terrific special effects, but lasted only a single year on its network in 1990. The series stuck to the Scarlet Speedster's origins: police scientist Barry Allen (John Wesley Shipp) is struck by lightning during an experiment, and chemicals splashed on him during the accident give him the ability to move at incredible speeds (note: hardcore comic fans know that this is the origin for the '60s version of the Flash, not his WWII-era identity). The series partnered him with an attractive fellow scientist (Amanda Pays) who assists Barry in his crime-fighting pursuits. Where the show deviated from its source material was its choice of combatants for the Flash--episodes focused on decidedly human villains, like corrupt officials (\"Watching the Detectives\") and mobsters (Michael Nader played ex-cop turned hood Nicholas Pike in two episodes, including the pilot), and didn't pull in the comic's excellent \"rogues' gallery\" until the end of the season, when the Trickster (Mark Hamill, who appears in two episodes), Captain Cold (Michael Champion), Mirror Master (David Cassidy!), and a sort-of Reverse-Flash (in the episode \"Twin Streaks\") made appearances. Sadly, these appearances were too little, too late for the series, which struggled with a high per-episode price tag and a fluctuating time slot (as well as frequent breaking coverage of the Gulf War). But for theFlashfaithful, the six-disc set compiles its entire 21-episode run, including the 90-minute pilot.

A waiter for four years since high school, Dean (Justin Long) has never questioned his job at Shenanigan's. But when he learns that Chett, a high school classmate, now has a lucrative career in electrical engineering, he's thrown into turmoil about his dead-end life. Dean's friend Monty (Ryan Reynolds) is in exactly the same boat, but he couldn't care less. More concerned with partying and getting laid, Monty is put in charge of training Mitch (John Francis Daley), a shy new employee.  Over the course of one chaotic shift, Mitch gets to know the rest of Shenanigan's quirky staff: Monty's tough-talking ex-girlfriend, Serena (Anna Faris), Shenanigan's over-zealous manager, Dan (David Koechner), and head cook Raddimus (Luis Guzman), who's obsessed with a senseless staff-wide competition known only as \"The Game\"...  Featuring crazy busboys, unsanitary kitchen antics, and lots of talk about sex, WAITING... is a hysterical, behind-the-scenes look at the restaurant industry, and an affectionate ode to those lost, and thoroughly unproductive, days of youth.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001MFNB58", "B000EMGJAO", "B000069CF0", "B000LC3ICE", "B000E6EHE0", "B00363WGBO", "B000JJ4DNW", "B000IZJZIU", "B000WZEZGI", "B0023TCWE8", "B000I0RNVQ", "B00AEFYS2M", "B001J9KJ4I", "B000AP04L0", "B001L9EXTS", "B000Y7U93C", "B00AEFZ3XU", "B001OD4S50", "B00AEFXVW0", "B00007AJGM", "B00005JNZU", "B0002V7TMY", "B000031WD9", "B000YW8RN6", "B00260HH1W", "B0016MJ6GA", "B0009P42WI", "B000063RQO", "B00005JKMN", "B002ZG97XI", "B0017JHQPK", "B000BKVQS4", "B004HO6I2E", "B0007DFJ0G", "B004SIP6LS", "B001G5T6GW", "B000M9CB4W", "B00000FA91", "B00005JMX6", "B00005V9HR", "0783230338", "B004SIP8ES", "B00AEFXIUK", "B00029RTAI", "B0009HBPN0", "B001O0TWYK", "B000K7VHOG", "B001KKU9DW", "6301964160", "B00860YIJU", "B000EGDBZ6", "630529142X", "B000J4P9P8", "B000WCN8QE", "B004I9SJH0", "B00005JMYI", "B00AEFY854", "B00003CXPS", "B00AEFYZCU", "B002Q4VBPQ", "B007D0FUTG", "B003Y5H5B0", "B000O77SF4", "B002FU8IWU", "B003PIUINS", "B00003CXWV", "B002IKIHEG", "B004SIP95G", "B008R65XNS", "B002T4GWWA", "B00AEFYAMA", "B0068MNO2U", "B000MCH5RM", "B000BO0L90", "B002ZGW92E", "B005LAIH9A", "B000G0O5I2", "0790729997", "B004EPZ084", "B00009W5F2", "B000N3SU92", "B00AEFY0XE", "B00008WJD6", "B004SEUJO6", "6305222908", "B00DW5IKYS", "B00AEBB8FQ", "B0026BXHQ0", "B00AEBBA2C", "B000OYC7BW", "B002ZG98B4", "B000FKO5QK", "B00029RTCG", "B000TZJBPQ", "B000031EFY", "B0016Q2D66", "B00AG4714S", "B0006HBZEW", "0800141687", "B00441GYVK"], "bought_together": ["B001MFNB58", "B000EMGJAO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00E8RKHWW", "B000AP04L0", "B004SEUIW4", "B000EMGJAO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 11312}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.21, "brand": "Vidmark/Trimark", "asin": "B000CPH9PM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51TJVHXCPGL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Waiting...

{"description": "A sterling cast and vivid direction giveNorth Countryan emotional heft to match its political convictions. Charlize Theron (Monster) plays Josey Aimes, who goes to work at a Minnesota steel mine after splitting with her violent husband.Frances McDormand and CharlizeTheron inNorth Country.But the job proves to be almost as harrowing as her marriage; the male miners, resentful of women taking jobs, verbally abuse and play humiliating pranks on the female miners. After being physically assaulted by a coworker, Josey tries to fight against the harassment, but none of the other women will join her case for fear that things will only get worse.North Country, directed by Niki Caro (Whale Rider), makes the women's experience palpable for the audience without overdoing it. But the lawsuit is only part of the movie; the gut impact ofNorth Countrycomes from the devastating effect the lawsuit has on Josey's family, friends, and coworkers--thanks to an incredible ensemble cast that includes Sissy Spacek (In the Bedroom), Sean Bean (Lord of the Rings), Richard Jenkins (Six Feet Under), Woody Harrelson (The People vs. Larry Flynt), and the always powerful Frances McDormand (Fargo,Mississippi Burning). The courtroom histrionics don't always ring true, but the family conflict is riveting and deeply moving.

{"description": "On the surface, David Cronenberg may seem an unlikely candidate to directA History of Violence, but dig deeper and you'll see that he's the right man for the job. As an intellectual seeker of meaning and an avowed believer in Darwinian survival of the fittest, Cronenberg knows that the story of mild-mannered small-town diner proprietor Tom Stall (Viggo Mortensen) is in fact a multilayered examination of inbred human behavior, beginning when Tom's skillful killing of two would-be robbers draws unwanted attention to his idyllic family life in rural Indiana. He's got a loving wife (Maria Bello) and young daughter (Heidi Hayes) who are about to learn things about Tom they hadn't suspected, and a teenage son (Ashton Holmes) who has inherited his father's most prominent survival trait, manifesting itself in ways he never expected. By the time Tom has come into contact with a scarred villain (Ed Harris) and connections that lead him to a half-crazy kingpin (William Hurt, in a spectacular cameo), Cronenberg has plumbed the dark depths of human nature so skillfully thatA History of Violencestands well above the graphic novel that inspired it (indeed, Cronenberg was unaware of the source material behind Josh Olson's chilling adaptation). With hard-hitting violence that's as sudden as it is graphically authentic, this isA History of Violencethat's worthy of serious study and widespread acclaim.--Jeff ShannonOn the DVDOn a single disc and with little fanfare, this DVD makes an excellent case for the best extras of the year. Dive into the one-hour-long documentary and learn more about moviemaking than on many a double-disc. The secret lies in director David Cronenberg's (and his usual crew) folksy casualness in showing off the craft, be it makeup (green screens were used), directing (Cronenberg doesn't storyboard), or art direction (the diner set). It also is very funny to hear about \"fish Fridays\" and how Maria Bello's Uncle Pete became an influence. Even the infamous sex-on-the-staircase scene is diagnosed with candor as stars Viggo Mortensen and Bello act as if there is no backstage camera. There's only one deleted scene, but it's uncommonly deconstructed on why it was filmed and why it was cut (it's a very Cronenbergian dream sequence). A short bit on Cannes is also a delight. So much is here that Cronenberg's smart commentary track is nearly superfluous. Isn't that a nice surprise?--Doug ThomasMore to ExploreThe Graphic NovelOther Graphic Novels that Inspired MoviesDavid Cronenberg EssentialsWhy We Love Maria BelloThe work of Viggo MortensenThe work of William HurtStills fromA History of ViolenceViggo Mortensoe as Tom StallAshton Holmes as Jack Stall and Kyle Schmid as Bobby JordanWilliam Hurt as Richie CusackEd Harris as Carl Fogarty and Viggo Mortensen as Tom StallMaria Bello as Edie StallDirector David Cronenberg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000YENUI6", "B001LRJH0U", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B008R65XP6", "B004SIP8ZM", "B001FB5634", "B0001EFV7C", "B00004W18Z", "B001EIOOWC", "6301971345", "B000M341QE", "B00000K31T", "B000GFLKF8", "B000P0J0D8", "0767802519", "B004SUDQ72", "B003ASLJQS", "B002PJYPYG", "6304698747", "B000F5WR4W", "B003Y5H4R0", "B0018O4YT0", "B00AEBB9CS", "B0028OH568", "B00HOGBXS6", "B00000JDIQ", "B000FUTVLY", "B002AT8KAG", "B000XR9L50", "6305313687", "0783228457", "B002QEHPQU", "B001FB55L2", "B000Y7WGOW", "B002VWNIEA", "B00022XE6S", "B006PTL1QM", "B000P0J0AG", "B004499LX0", "B00005JMOW", "B002T9H2LA", "B001TOD92C", "B005OK721G", "B000FKO5QK", "B0019EXZY4", "B002ZG99N6", "B0007DFJ0G", "B003LR5BD0", "B003RHZ6F2", "B00AEFY5B6", "B000N6TX1I", "0792833279", "B005LAIIJY", "B000FVQM2Y", "B000FC2FX8", "B001BNFRB2", "B00005JN0W", "B002XMGGK6", "B00007E8UI", "B0064NTZQ2", "B00D3DJIG8", "B0010DR4BO", "B0013XZ6X4", "B00AEFXE9U", "B007D5E7C2", "B000ALM40I", "B00001ZWUS", "B00005V9HH", "B00008RH3L", "0783229402", "B000QXDCLK", "B000P0J0EW", "B000BBOUUE", "B000A7DVR2", "B000K7VHQ4", "B00000F4MA", "B000XA5K48", "B00004XPPB", "B0002IQMAM", "B00029LNYQ", "B00003CXWV", "B004XQO90O", "B000GIW9I2", "B004U7MR14", "B002DKGWSE", "B0064MT1FI", "B0000TANUI", "B009T3AE1Y", "B0000VLKVM", "B00006LPGP", "B00005JLRE", "B000F7CMRM", "B00AEFXESQ", "B001DZOC64", "1558908315", "B0036TGTDE", "B000NOKFHQ", "B008220DGE", "B00007AJE1", "B000BVM1S2"], "bought_together": ["B000YENUI6", "B001LRJH0U"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000YENUI6", "B008MILL78", "B009T3AE1Y", "B000M341QE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 45602}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.36, "brand": "Warner Brothers", "asin": "B000CQLZ0Q", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51g0dghsrYL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "A History of Violence (New Line Platinum Series) [DVD]"}

{"description": "Before becoming known as \"Pam Beesley\" in the US version of NBC'sThe Office, Jenna Fischer had the idea to make the wonderfully dark, satirical mockumentaryLolliLove. Two small problems: she didn&#x92;t have the money or the filmmaking experience to put it together. Luckily that didn&#x92;t stop her. Instead, Jenna scraped together $2,000, a skeleton film crew, lots of real home video footage and personal photos and managed to pull off an artistic trifeca of writing, starring and directing her first film. On the surface, the story seems simple, maybe even stupid. James and Jenna Gunn (played by real-life husband-and-wife team, James Gunn and Jenna Fischer) are a wealthy couple living the good life. Bored, Jenna is looking for an outlet to channel her excess energy and chooses to pursue charity work. She decides that helping the homeless would be a noble endeavor and dreams up the charity, \"LolliLove.\" The plan - by giving out lollipops with inspirational artwork and cheery slogans on the wrapper, LolliLove will eradicate homelessness by transforming your average \"homeless person\" into an important and loved \"happy person\". Of course, as we watch LolliLove blossom from an idea to an actual charity, nothing goes as planned and James and Jenna's marriage is put to the ultimate test.  In all honesty,LolliLoveis a lot more than a comedy on doing charity work. It's a critical essay on the superficial, selfish and phony reasons many people pursue charity work in an attempt to make themselves feel better about who they are. What makes the film work is a combination of James and Jenna's realistic comedic interactions, the originality of the script and the dark, funny and poignant message about marriage relations that is subtly revealed over the course of the film.LolliLoveis a reassuring example of how sharp, fun and intelligent movies can still be made independently and on a micro budget.--Rob Bracco", "related": {"also_bought": ["B005EIHMXG", "B0086900OS", "B000Z8H13Q", "B003Q6D21Y", "B002Q0WYPG", "B00009PY2T", "6304723113", "B000GYI3B8", "B005EIHMUE", "B001HBVE92", "B001AEF6AY", "B0006Z2ND6", "B0009E27SK", "B0074JOE2K"], "bought_together": ["B005EIHMXG", "B0086900OS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005EIHMXG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 37271}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 10.35, "brand": "Koch International", "asin": "B000CSUNTS", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61SCWYS7FEL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Lollilove"}

{"description": "Been dying for another dose of chills from your old poison pal, the Crypt-Keeper? Then pull up a slab and revisit all the repulsive goings-on in the third season ofTales from the Crypt, the over-the-top TV anthology inspired by the classic E.C. horror comics of the '50s. All 14 episodes of the 1991 season are compiled in this three-disc set; as with previous seasons, the shows serve up gruesome tongue-in-cheek fables adapted from the original comics (and spiced up with some liberal nudity and impressive special effects), and with a host of Hollywood talent in front of and behind the camera. Series producers Robert Zemeckis and Walter Hill each contribute a creepshow apiece (the impressive season closer \"Yellow,\" with Kirk Douglas and Dan Aykroyd, and \"Deadline,\" withCSI's Marg Helgenberger, respectively), while Michael J. Fox stars and directs the season opener \"The Trap\" (which co-stars Teri Garr and Bruno Kirby). Elsewhere, Tobe Hooper (The Texas Chainsaw Massacre) gets gruesome with Whoopi Goldberg in the voodoo vengeance story \"Dead Wait,\" while action veterans Russell Mulcahy (Highlander), Stephen Hopkins (The Life and Death of Peter Sellers), and Steven De Souza (screenwriter onDie Hard) each unleash their inner spook engines on an episode, with Hopkins's bizarre \"Abra Cadaver\" (with Tony Goldwyn and Beau Bridges as dueling doctor siblings) a perfect summation of theCryptspirit and the season highlight. The third-season set is rounded out by a trifecta of extras:A Tall Tales Panelis a 14-minute look at the season, with comments by a panel of series participants recorded at Comic Con in San Diego.A Tales from the Crypt Reunionis the complete half-hour panel discussion, andCrypt Jamis a frothy music video composed of clips from the season.--Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000FFJYC0", "B000A88EU0", "B000GYI322", "B000SULWKO", "B000P0J0E2", "B0009ETCOW", "B006BZ8NSE", "B0030E5PYO", "B000Q66Q56", "B00LU4URS0", "B00LMBURDG", "B000RXVNCO", "B003VJTGNE", "B004SUDQCW", "B00GSMZ3I8", "B00KTFJ50M", "B00L89VL96", "B0053TWV46", "B002JHD9D2", "B001LM64VA", "B002HK9HZU", "B0000AOX0C", "B00HRUQB8Q", "B002GHHHG0", "B002FLOTPO", "B00009PY4C", "B0002VYOVS", "B00K1L4NBU", "B00KYCA4QY", "B000N2HD6Y", "B00GHH9IIA", "B00EL6ACBQ", "B000HEVZ94", "1616552905", "B000I2J68M", "B001DXS4DI", "B00009YXHN", "B0002CX1M0", "B00BTYPW7C", "B0000AOX0B", "B00005KH30", "B00363WGIM", "B000FFJZO2", "B001D5C1R6", "B00JHH21C2", "B000WC384Q", "B006TBYC76", "B005ZHBEPI", "B0002JP572", "B002EP8FDI", "B000UYX4PO", "B000UVV22E", "B001J710ZW", "B003VJTGMU", "B003VOVW2C", "B0002C4JJ4", "B00D7AM5XU", "B00K31RBYY", "B0053TWV5K", "B00EALTVPA", "B000096I9V", "B008CYDD7I", "B0009YCLBS", "B000099T3M", "B0081XOK9A", "B0002C9DK4", "B00DRQETEW", "B00DW5ILJC", "B00006FDBT", "B00JHH1W9K", "0783232039", "B004VQRCJG", "B00EU8RC1S", "B000TSIJWY", "B000A6T1ZY", "B0007CEXUY", "B001B8XRT6", "6305162018", "B00DOZNGTK", "B000IMUYJM", "B00HRUQ7WG", "B000U1ZV7Q", "B002EP8FF6", "B00GSTHD1G", "B000MNOX8U", "B0007WFXNA", "B00013D54Y", "B002I41KNC", "6305841985", "B000053UIF", "B00005UQ9I", "B006ZUMOX0", "B00A429Y56", "B00JPUUQVE", "B003NOGNQU", "B002AMVEII", "B00CERJI5U", "B003PIUINI", "B0053TWVIM"], "bought_together": ["B000FFJYC0", "B000SULWKO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000A88EU0", "B003NKU9XM", "B000SULWKO", "B0030E5PYO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 10055}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 32.99, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B000E1MXWS", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5171qYwX5GL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Tales from the Crypt: Season 3"}
{"description": "WhenLife Goes Onfirst aired on ABC in 1989, it wore its ground-breaking bravura on its theoretical sleeve: The dramedy focused on a hard-working but deep-loving Midwest family, the Thachers, with a small twist. Son Corky, 18, had Down syndrome, and the actor who played him, the charming, sweet-faced Chris Burke, also has Down syndrome. And while many of the plot points revolved around Corky and the challenges he faced being \"mainstreamed\" into a regular high school, his sweet temperament and determination, and the ongoing trials of the rest of the members of the family, made for a compelling and well-rounded TV saga. The Emmy-nominated Kellie Martin (who would go on to star inER) plays plucky sister Becca, the 14-year-old initially mortified that her older brother would be in her freshman class, but she rallies, believably, and becomes a key source of emotional support for Corky. The other cast high point is Patti LuPone, who in the '80s was one of the premiere stars ofBroadway musicals, and who plays the loving but sometimes battle-scarred mom, Libby, to steely perfection.The Complete First Seasoncontains all 22 episodes, plus some great extras, including commentaries by Burke and series creator Michael Braverman. In the end what made the Thacher family so special was that it was really just like every family; sometimes there are curve balls, and sometimes there are wild moments of joy. And always, life goes on.--A.T.

{"description": "Deadwood: The Complete Second Seasoncontinues the Shakespearean brilliance of the landmarkfirst season, created byNYPD Bluehead writer David Milch. Milch either wrote or supervised the writing of each of the 12 episodes in this stunning follow-up, which contains more than a few surprises for anyone who thought they knew the myriad characters in the late 19th century town of Deadwood--a mucky, ungoverned, exceptionally violent development in South Dakota. As with the first season,Deadwoodcontinues to be about many things--survival, loyalty, alliances, duty--but all of them are happening against a titanic battle between several parties to consolidate power and real wealth in the territory. Despite his cutthroat ethics, astonishing profanity, and bursts of cruelty, it's hard not to side in this bid for a piece of America's future with saloon owner Al Swearengen (a magnificent performance by Ian McShane), a visionary monster who is nevertheless more recognizably human than his rivals.Entering an uneasy partnership with Al is Seth Bullock (Timothy Olyphant). Seth begins the second season by teaching Al a few lessons in chivalry, and their brief but bloody feud commences physical ailments for Al that become increasingly shocking to behold. Yet Al's difficulties have the practical effect of sidelining him for a couple of episodes while the story sets up more complex power struggles. Al takes on Deadwood's other saloon-brothel owner, the unstable Cy Tolliver (Powers Boothe), as well as an off-screen millionaire who is intent on owning all the gold-mining interests by buying out weary prospectors' claims. Meanwhile, Seth's wife and son (actually, his late brother's widow and child) arrive, an unsettling development for Seth's lover, the widow Alma Garret (Molly Parker), who soon reveals herself to be a more complicated person than in the first season. The prostitute Trixie (Paula Malcomson) begins thinking about her future and asserts independence from Al by having sex with Seth's friend, Sol Star (John Hawkes). Best of all, Calamity Jane (Robin Weigert) is back and more endearingly uncivilized than ever. Special features include actor commentaries on select episodes, the best of which finds Olyphant and McShane cracking each other up while watching the season premiere.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000NVI2GU", "B0006FO5LO", "B00B5J6A7W", "B007A2Z3Y4", "B0038M2APA", "B0075FF5QM", "B00A2JOQMW", "B004HW7JNS", "B00CG4XKNM", "B00EAPC860", "B00076YPUI", "B00HT850YW", "B00G4RCCUE", "B004BZ5AHI", "B000067S1G", "B008PJZDXW", "B00005NOHO", "B0028RXXE8", "B0090XO59U", "B0007YMVWO", "B00HUCF420", "B005LAJ1H2", "B00J5LXT44", "B009LDD54K", "B00316DDUO", "B0010XB1WM", "B00C8CQRQ4", "B00BC5I6Q2", "B00CDTSFF8", "B00EIXWW2O", "B002UJIY7A", "B0012RLX88", "B003Y5HWJU", "B000E3L7F0", "B0060MYKYY", "B00FEP9MYG", "B00EEDNR9A", "B000K2V7E6", "B00008PW1F", "B00BFAIH68", "B000BO7DWI", "B0058YPG1G", "B00IXWIFR2", "1596912391", "B000PGTPH8", "B00EUI4XHE", "B002N5N5QQ", "B0051GOB2G", "B003FSTN7U", "B00HW3EXCE", "B0032UYFA6", "B0007R4SWM", "B004QRUN96", "B00BQ42Q38", "B0032JTV6A", "B00GWJIDFW", "B001RTSPVY", "B001GCUER0", "B001TH8ZH8", "B00G0B7PTW", "B0006UEVUE", "6304711905", "B000NA1VI2", "B004CQZFH6", "B00280LZAE", "B000OIOOVE", "B00FRQ0HOQ", "B0015A5JVY", "B003PIUBZS", "B000FL7CB4", "B00BGI076M", "B009ERK2UI", "B001DJLCRC", "B00DJYJRHG", "B000YABIQ6", "B000EMGF3U", "B002ZCY8CC", "B002LITH76", "B001OQCVFG", "B001IBIHQ4", "B00KHA9BQ2", "B0009NZ2W4", "B00AATGDUC", "B0024FAR5M", "B003L77GS8", "B00CBJ53HS", "B00C7AO2J6", "B0038M2AOG", "B006CR2OOA", "B0012CJQYQ", "B008JFUS5A", "B00E1LSJIO", "B005FISBTO", "B000ENUYGI", "B000E6EK42", "B009LDD1H6", "B00HOGBXS6", "B00ECGHM5O", "B001EO748M", "B004WXBMT4"], "bought_together": ["B000NVI2GU", "B0006FO5LO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0006FO5LO", "B001FA1OTU", "B000NVI2GU", "B00B5J6A7W"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 5202}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 35.0, "brand": "Warner Brothers", "asin": "B000EULSR0", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51TO7W-wZzL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Deadwood: Season 2"}

{"description": "The Cryptkeeper dusts off another set of horror yarns in this fourth collection ofTales from the Crypt, featuring more semi-big-stars, a handful of name directors, and a bevy of excruciatingly bad puns. There are some goodies here if you're nostalgic for 1950s-era comic-book scares (or for vintage 1992 late-night pay-cable), but this fourth season represents diminishing returns for the franchise. The 14 episodes get off to a poor start with the first installments, including \"None but the Lonely Heart\" (directed by Tom Hanks, who cameos), about a Lothario (Treat Williams) who marries and kills rich old ladies, and \"This'll Kill Ya\" (directed by Robert Longo), about a nasty drug researcher (Dylan McDermott). The series' very sporadic nudity is provided here by Sonia Braga.Of the famous directors represented, best in show is John Frankenheimer, whose \"Maniac at Large\" makes sinuous use of a single set, a large library; Blythe Danner plays a meek librarian in fear of a serial killer, and Salome Jens (star of Frankenheimer's \"Seconds\") is her shrewish boss. Elsewhere, William Friedkin should be embarrassed by \"On a Deadman's Chest,\" an extremely silly rock & roll thing about a tattoo with a life of its own. And Richard Donner's \"Showdown,\" while providing a welcome bit of Western atmosphere, is either an existential puzzler or an unfinished production. The directorial novelty must be \"Split Personality\", a story of a con man (Joe Pesci) seducing a wealthy pair of twins. It's one of the more entertaining episodes, and it marks the sole directing outing for Hollywood mega-producer (andTalesexec producer) Joel Silver. For sheer perversity, few segments top \"Beauty Rest\", in which aspiring actress Mimi Rogers ends up regretting a successful audition (with Buck Henry, of all people).The biggest rising-star find is probably Brad Pitt in \"King of the Road\", a lame tale of hotrod racers. Timothy Dalton, then fresh from his James Bond run, stars in one of the better shows in this set, \"Werewolf Concerto,\" a clever piece about a werewolf hunter staying at a lodge terrorized by a lycanthrope. Perhaps the most sustained episode--nailing the series' blend of campy humor and gory fright--is \"What's Cookin',\" in which Christopher Reeve, the owner of an all-squid restaurant, revitalizes the business by switching to a different kind of meat.The minimal extras are a commentary track for the Chris Reeve episode (including the voice of the Cryptkeeper, John Kassir) and a perfunctory montage about the season's stars. The show has a loyal following that will be happy to own this set, but for anybody else it must be noted that season 4 is a year of decline, and not the place to start for horror-curious boils and ghouls.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000E1MXWS", "B000GYI322", "B000SULWKO", "B000P0J0E2", "B000A88EU0", "B006BZ8NSE", "B0009ETCOW", "B0030E5PYO", "B000Q66Q56", "B00IWOHG76", "B00LMBURDG", "B003VJTGNE", "B00LBFFR2Y", "B00KTFJ50M", "B004SUDQCW", "B0053TWV46", "B000RXVNCO", "B00J3LXLNA", "B00L89VL96", "B00ENFVQIS", "B00KDU8HQQ", "B00GSMZ3I8", "B00ITOB5NU", "B00ITOB5DK", "B00I3C347S", "B00LLAV26O", "B002GHHHG0", "B00GHH9IIA", "B00FFC13EU", "B00ER7OQIE", "B002EP8FDI", "B00HRUQB8Q", "B002FLOTPO", "B002HK9HZU", "B008CYDD7I", "B00HRUQ7WG", "B00GSTHD1G", "B00K1L4NBU", "B000HC2LX0", "B00IKD4D1G", "B0000APVJ0", "B0000AOX0B", "B0002VYOVS", "B00JHH21C2", "B00E3RH37Y", "B0000AOX0C", "B00IVFCM2U", "B00D7TS972", "B000N2HD6Y", "B00ER7OQDE", "B001DXS4DI", "B0007WFXNA", "B00FPM1BME", "B00A429Y56", "B001LM64VA", "B00K7PB3ZY", "B00009YXHN", "B006TBYC76", "B00013D54Y", "B00EL6ACBQ", "B000UYX4PO", "B006TURZA8", "B00AEFYV9W", "B000WC384Q", "B001957A44", "B00AGKHG06", "B00DUARBNG", "B00363WGIM", "B001B3LIQA", "B0024FAG44", "B008HSK3PE", "B002JHD9D2", "B00006FDBT", "B00IJZPZLW", "B00J0RZKE0", "B00CHFOZN4", "B00AZTUUQK", "B00IJZPZM6", "B00BTYPW7C", "B004XQVCCW", "B00IJZPZLC", "B00005JOJE", "B000RIWAV2", "B00005KH30", "B000BYA4JW", "B00BN3DZZA", "B006ZUMOX0", "B001JAHSAA", "B0058S0OMS", "B0002CX1M0", "B003PIUINI", "B00EALTVPA", "B0002J4ZX2", "B00JHH1W9K", "B00DW5ILJC", "B00005N5RM", "B00JGR3M80", "B000JU7JIW", "B00E0EXYMS", "B000HEVZ94"], "bought_together": ["B000E1MXWS", "B000GYI322"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0030E5PYO", "B000A88EU0", "B003NKU9XM", "B000SULWKO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 9409}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 15.09, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B000FFJYC0", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61M5H7RC0SL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Tales from the Crypt: Season 4"}

{"description": "Call itKolchak: The Night Stalker, The College YearsorBuffy the Vampire Slayer for Boys, but the horror seriesSupernaturaldelivers some of the most satisfying small-screen scares in recent memory. The premise is deceptively simple: brothers Sam and Dean (Jared Padalecki fromGilmore Girlsand Jensen Ackles, both appealing) travel the darker corners of the American landscape in search of their father, who's gone missing while hunting the malevolent forces that lead to the death of their mother. In the course of their search, the siblings encounter a host of otherworldly creatures, including vampires, ghosts, and witches, as well as such distinctly American phenomena as the urban-legend favorite the Hook (\"Hookman\"), monsters from Native American mythology (\"Wendigo\"), and fearful figures from children's games (\"Bloody Mary\").Supernatural's integration of elements from American pop culture and folklore, combined with its skilled cast and crew (creator/co-writer Erik Kripke delivered 2005'sBoogeyman, while director/executive producer David Nutter is a veteran ofThe X-FilesandMillennium), and better-than-average attempts at atmosphere and suspense place the series well above the other spookshow programs that arrived on networks at about the same time (Invasion,Night Stalker), and should hold considerable appeal for fans of frightful fare.The six-disc set contains all 22 episodes of the debut season, with commentary by Ackles and Padalecki on \"Phantom Traveler\" and Nutter, Kripke, and producer Peter Johnson on the pilot episode; two making-of documentaries (one on the show itself, and the other on its stars), as well as a brace of unaired scenes and a gag reel round out the set. For those with DVD-ROM capabilities, the set also includes a link to a web site which offers a sneak preview at season 2 and the pilot script, among other bonus features.--Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000R7GKQE", "B000X5SPBI", "B001FB4W0C", "B002JVWRAO", "B003L77GGK", "B004YM6JI2", "B009LDCXNY", "B00FEVZDC0", "B004VLLWA6", "B002JVWR9U", "B00I6PLIZM", "1608871452", "0062103377", "0425241378", "B0058YPGL6", "B001C4CI8U", "B001FB4W0W", "0061367036", "B0006IUE16", "B00ED2IBXE", "0062073192", "0061435031", "B000EHSVKK", "B009LDD5XQ", "B004SMDJ9U", "B000HT3P60", "0061370916", "B00HEQTEGO", "B000V86OKG", "B000ERVJM2", "B004PHSTY8", "B008X6N8KW", "B004CWLRF4", "B00JF5G8WU", "B000QDLSR0", "B000OIOPHC", "B00GTZWZH6", "B0009A5MUO", "B0049P1VHS", "B00005JM3A", "B00IK2T0AG", "B0001JXPPC", "B000Q6GUW0", "B0002Y0QV2", "1781161119", "B0009W5J4Q", "B008H1Q61G", "B00B4804LM", "B00DTMJM7I", "B000BNI90Y", "B00AEBBAEK", "B00KS9V6EC", "184856600X", "0743400453", "B000B5XOW0", "B00CVPQ9M0", "B000G1R4SO", "B009NH6AOQ", "B001BN4WL8", "B00EIL7E9C", "B002JVWRD6", "B001992NWO", "B00A8KJN8M", "B005LAJ1O0", "B004LROMWU", "B00005JLKB", "B0032JTV6A", "B009LDCXQQ", "B0029Z8K60", "B0024FAR5M", "B003L77GH4", "B004132HZS", "B00005JM5E", "B003YF9Q08", "B000NA2BEU", "B000JLTRIG", "B00129W6LE", "B00280LZAE", "B000G0MI86", "B004X60QE2", "B003Y5HWJU", "B0015ABRE2", "B000ION72Q", "B00GOYHSGK", "B000RO6JYK", "B0053O8A46", "B001QE99AQ", "B00B5ARKC0", "B00G5TQZOK", "B009LDCWWG", "B000IY04Q8", "B008CJ0KBU", "B00CDTSFF8", "B00ANDBWZG", "B00GTZWWXI", "0312594437", "B002BWP2IK", "B00G5V0QNY", "B00IWTVDUW", "B001XRLWPQ"], "bought_together": ["B000R7GKQE", "B000X5SPBI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00FNYN5Q4", "B009LDCXNY", "B000X5SPBI", "B000R7GKQE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 2497}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 21.0, "brand": "WHV", "asin": "B000FP2OPY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51jZNSmhBYL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Supernatural: Season 1"}
{"description": "Director Mick Garris (Sleepwalkers), also recruited by Stephen King to remakeThe Shining, knows how to capture King's horror aesthetic on film.Desperation, based on a more recent King novel, is a pastiche of earlier King novelties, such as the psycho in uniform, this time Sheriff Collie Entragian (Ron Perlman), and dogs summoned by the devil, this time by TAK, an ancient Chinese demon. Desperation, Nevada has a collapsed mine full of Chinese immigrant ghosts, whose spirits are trapped with TAK until they're accidentally unleashed. The TAK-possessed local sheriff is killing everyone, save a few travelers who stumble through on road trips. In the opening scene, Mary (Annabeth Gish) and her beau are pulled over by Sheriff Entragian, framed by his placing of marijuana in their trunk, then read their rights with a Satanic \"I will kill you\" thrown in. Later, Steve (Steven Weber), Cynthia (Kelly Overton), and Vietnam vet John Marinville (Tom Skerrit), ride into town, and they too encounter the evil policeman's wrath. They all meet a brave, imprisoned boy, David (Shane Haboucha), with whom they team up to end the mayhem.Desperationuses blue and green lighting to embrace the funhouse look, and camera shots highlighting the Sheriff's deranged face make the film occasionally spooky. But the rehashed plot detracts from the fear-factor, leaving one to pine for earlier King story adaptations, likeMisery, orCujo.--Trinie Dalton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B006J8NPAE", "B000GYI340", "B00005UQ9V", "B00000F3SB", "1573625779", "B0000C2IQQ", "B000063US5", "0792841328", "B000053UIF", "B00AEBB91E", "B000U1ZV6W", "B0007WFXNA", "B00BW4S8AC", "B00009OWI3", "6305120021", "B0001FVDQ4", "B00BW4S87U", "B0002OXVG4", "B0010X73ZG", "B00AEBB91O", "B00006FDCD", "0767821599", "B000068IES", "6305645574", "B0002O7XW2", "B000RZIGUE", "B0007NFMB2", "B002NZK5SM", "B000H4JH7Q", "B008QE9Z8A", "B00005O439", "B0084MVE7E", "B00AEFYV9W", "630523650X", "B000077VRT", "B000TJ6PBK", "B0002A2VK0", "B00005LQ0Q", "B00BW4S89S", "B000GBEWRU", "B0053TWVDC", "B00AEFXR8I", "B00A1AU72A", "B00006FDCU", "1573626910", "B000069I05", "B0033HKCV4", "B0053TWV46", "B00030AZCK", "B00APQLJTA", "0792846443", "B00L8QOZK6", "B00LLAV26O", "B003L2M584", "6304604572", "B0052XU4BK", "B005CFBZVG", "0790742829", "B002VWNIDG", "6305899398", "B002AZTYPA", "B0091NKMWS", "B002KH4KSY", "B00BTYPW7C", "B00DII0MGI", "B00005K3NR", "B00L9K2EGS", "B0002234LS", "B00AKGG828", "0786890436", "B001AR0D4A", "6304936397", "0792842960", "B00KW3A6KE", "B002GHHHG0", "B000P0J0EM", "1476770387", "B008R52L3Y", "B00005JOJE", "B002JN3XFU", "1476754454", "B000HC2LFI", "B00B96TGQS", "B0084MVDUM", "B00IYJRIKO", "B000HCO86I", "B002WDR4AC", "B00003CXIP", "B00KNCFPA0", "B0013527K2", "B00A1AU702", "B003PIUINI", "B00HHYF570", "B00JF5GAIW", "B000MEYKDW", "B00006IUFV", "B004AC6PV2", "B00079Z9WI", "B0000AOX0D"], "bought_together": ["B000063US5", "B00BW4S8AC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000063US5", "B00006FDCD", "B0000C2IQQ", "B00BW4S8AC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 16446}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 5.87, "brand": "LIONS GATE HOME ENT.", "asin": "B000G1R39E", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51B5SJRCKQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Stephen King's Desperation"}

{"description": "In need of some good old-fashioned gore? You'll find it by the bucketload in the low-budget monsterfestFeast, which arrives on DVD in an even bloodier unrated edition. The winning entry in the third season of Ben Affleck and Matt Damon's reality series/talent contestProject Greenlight(Wes Craven is also on board as an advisor/producer),Feastis a wall-to-wall splatterthon that operates on an agreeably simple premise: A crew of motley characters is trapped in a remote location (in this case, a desert bar) by ravenous, flesh-eating monsters (here, a quartet of toothy and astoundingly fecund humanoids). The result? Lots of gruesome deaths and plenty of manic action, delivered with kinetic style by first-time feature director John Gulager. Not everything aboutFeastworks--Gulager's drive is thwarted by the unfocused script, which favors smarmy dialogue over substance--but the effects are impressive, given the film's price tag, and the cast is incredibly game for the gory goings-on, with Krista Allen (Entourage), Judah Friedlander (30 Rock), Balthazar Getty (Alias), and Gulager's father, veteran actor Clu Gulager, among the stand-outs. The DVD includes a smattering of outtakes and deleted scenes (including an alternate ending); commentary by Gulager, the screenwriters, and two of the film's numerous producers; and a making-of featurette, whichProject Greenlightviewers should find interesting solely for producers Chris Moore and Michael Leahy's attitudes towards Gulager (both were a hair's breath away from firing him throughout the production, but here, amusingly suggest unconditional support).-- Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001CDFY64", "B001KKU9CS", "B001J4E19C", "B0004Z31OS", "B000ARFPMQ", "B001T46TAQ", "B000GYI3B8", "B000RW5BZ0", "B00CERJI5U", "B002LMSWN2", "B000NVT0TI", "B000TJ6PB0", "B0002VYOVS", "B008CYDD7I", "B001MFNB4O", "B001MEJY8W", "B002ZG97CO", "B001221DUQ", "B005B0QYMM", "B0028DRGDQ", "B000GI3KGC", "B000MM0LIM", "B000WC38EQ", "B000OYCMLM", "B008G33PIM", "B000UAE7O0", "B00006AUIG", "B000WC389G", "B000069I05", "B0010X73ZG", "B000I0RNZ2", "B00I9TDMRM", "B000G1ALDY", "B004USUP58", "B00DMUFXOS", "B0013D8LLS", "B000068IEV", "B0014VPFVS", "B001D5C1OO", "B0002C9DK4", "B0009X75J2", "B00111YM5Q", "B004BLTNM0", "B00G5GNYY2", "B00C2R122Y", "B000IHY9TS", "B004EI2NP4", "B0006HBZYC", "B000R7HY0K", "B008WAM2E2", "B00005JMA8", "B00009OWI1", "B00003CWRF", "B0037E8HNI", "B0067QPVJ6", "B002QW7ALM", "B0031U8OEK", "B002EOVXBK", "B000AXWHSA", "B000Q66Q56", "B002ZG98N2", "B003L20IEW", "B0000VCZNE", "B0007WQHI0", "6305090564", "B004P7CN3G", "B000IMUYJM", "B00B04NJI0", "B00005JMDZ", "B0000E2R6P", "B000PMLJMQ", "B004EPYZOO", "B00005RHGK", "B008DVJOQ4", "B002YI9304", "B003T6LHWC", "0783227434", "B001MVYUR0", "B005GT3X68", "B000E8M0P6", "B001D2WU9I", "B00A1AU74I", "B00009MEC4", "B000099T3M", "B00DPUB5EW", "B008JFUNYG", "B00IJS2OR2", "B00125WATQ", "B002FICQFM", "B005QUQRBU", "B002JT69IW", "B00JJ3EHCG", "B00009W0U4", "B00196UTEG", "B000BUNZY2", "B00000K3TO", "B001QB9H1U", "B00DRQETEW", "B000K7UBSO", "B008OR5X4O"], "bought_together": ["B001CDFY64", "B001KKU9CS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003VMFWXO", "B001J4E19C", "B004AC6PV2", "B000GYI3B8"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 97129}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.85, "brand": "Weinstein Company", "asin": "B000GLL1U6", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51J881B54AL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Feast (Unrated Edition)"}

{"description": "What's that? You say there's not enough fright in your life? Well, let your old fearsome friend, the Crypt Keeper, put some pep into your tired blood with another lucky 13 episodes ofTales from the Crypt, the shock-show series based on the infamous E.C. horror comics of the 1950s. As withCrypt's previous seasons, the gruesome formula in the 1993 Season 5 remains the same: Half-hour episodes rife with murderous spouses, the walking dead, and horrific twists of fate, liberally spiced up with gallons of gore and nudity, and featuring some of Hollywood's most famous faces behind and in front of the camera. The season's hellacious highlights are probably Gary Fleder's \"Forever Ambergris,\" with Steve Buscemi and the Who's Roger Daltrey as rival combat photographers whose competition comes to a sticky end courtesy of exposure to chemical weapons; and the season opener, \"Death of Some Salesman\" (by Gilbert Adler, who later helmed theCrypttheatrical featureBordello of Blood), with Tim Curry in three roles as a rural family with a big surprise for a duplicitous con man (Ed Begley Jr.). Elsewhere, actor Kyle MacLachlan directs Hector Elizondo and Patsy Kensit in the noirish \"As Ye Sow\";Highlander's Russell Mulcahy oversees Bill Paxton and Michael Lerner in the grisly revenge tale \"People Who Live in Brass Hearses\"; and Kevin Hooks unleashes Traci Lords and David Paymer in \"Two for the Show,\" a classic E.C. story of henpecked husbands and overheated wives, with a splattery switcheroo at its conclusion.Entourage's Kevin Dillon, Martin Sheen, Brooke Shields, Lou Diamond Phillips, John Stamos, and Cheech Marin are also featured in the ghoulish goings-on, with Gregory (Rescue Me) Widen, the late Jeffrey Boam (The Adventures of Brisco County Jr.), and Uli Edel (Last Exit to Brooklyn) among the other directors orchestrating the on-screen mayhem. John Kassir, the voice of the Crypt Keeper, returns to provide narration for the set's sole extra, a \"virtual comic book\" that features the original comic on which \"Salesman\" was based.-- Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000FFJYC0", "B000P0J0E2", "B000E1MXWS", "B000SULWKO", "B000A88EU0", "B003NKU9XM", "B0009ETCOW", "B0030E5PYO", "B00L89VL96", "B000Q66Q56", "B000RXVNCO", "B003VJTGNE", "B004SUDQCW", "B00KTFJ50M", "B003VJTGMU", "B0053TWV46", "B00GSMZ3I8", "B00KDU8HQQ", "B001LM64VA", "B002HK9HZU", "B000N2HD6Y", "B00009YXHN", "B00BTYPW7C", "B002EP8FDI", "B008CYDD7I", "B00005JOJE", "B0001ZX0GK", "B00HRUQB8Q", "B00HRUQ7WG", "B000069I05", "B00363WGIM", "B00LBHODDG", "B00EALTVPA", "B0002KQNL8", "B00JGR3M80", "B002GHHHG0", "B00GHH9IIA", "B000IMUYJM", "B00DRQETEW", "B00AEFY2WI", "6305090564", "B00BM4Q4H6", "B00D7AM71A", "B000I2J68M", "B008JFUNYG", "B0000DC12T", "B00AGKH4MG", "B000RIWAVW", "B008HSK3PE", "B005J9ZFQG", "B00EF0NY7W", "B0053TWW9K", "B002FLOTPO", "B0058S0OMS", "B00CZ15G7Y", "B002JHD9D2", "B00AEFY2LO", "B008CYDDWI", "B00K1L4NBU", "0767817664", "B000FFJZO2", "B00ETHN9L2", "B00AEFY31S", "B008DVJOQ4", "B0000694WL", "B000099T3M", "B00CPTUNVA", "B0007WFXNA", "B00005LC4Q", "B000E6ESA8", "B0002S9QUA", "B0009YCLBS", "B00BCMSY80", "B00JJOY47I", "B0000AOX0B", "1616552905", "B00DOZNGTK", "B00AEFYV9W", "B00006FDCU", "B00919THZU", "B000IJ7A5Q", "157347049X", "B002FLOTYU", "B00DTPRYY8", "B00CS7PKN0", "B0021L9MJG", "B00005LQ0Z", "B008DL4LN0", "B0016MJ6P6", "B008HUSFXE", "B000UVV22O", "B006TBYC76", "B009DA743Y", "B00A429Y56", "B00092ZLDK", "B001OXLGIM", "B00006FI0R", "B00006FDBT"], "bought_together": ["B000FFJYC0", "B000E1MXWS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B006BZ8NSE", "B000FFJYC0", "B000SULWKO", "B003NKU9XM"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 17151}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 14.9, "brand": "WHV", "asin": "B000GYI322", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51I1EXP3GAL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Tales from the Crypt: Season 5"}

{"description": "For two years, CBS'sJoan of Arcadiamanaged the neat trick of warming the heart, while keeping the gag reflex at bay. And for a family drama based around faith--and the lack thereof--preachiness was always in short supply. At the end of the first season, Joan (Amber Tamblyn) decides it's all in her head: God isn't really speaking to her. Over the summer, she attends a camp for troubled kids, and now she makes lamps. Her boyfriend, Adam (Christopher Marquette), is as confused as ever; he was just starting to believe her. While Joan questions God's existence, her mother, Helen (Mary Steenburgen), plans a return to the Catholic Church. To that end, she starts meeting with chain-smoking former nun Lilly (Constance Zimmer,Boston Legal) to help with her confirmation. Joan's father, Will (Joe Mantegna), older brother Kevin (Jason Ritter), and Helen must also contend with the lawsuit filed by the boy who caused Kevin's accident, while Joan's younger brother, Luke (Michael Welch), continues to see the surly Grace (Becky Wahlstrom) in secret.New Arcadia arrivals include Will's controlling boss, Lucy (Annie Potts), Joan's \"crazy camp\" friend, Judith (Sprague Grayden), and enigmatic do-gooder Ryan (Wentworth Miller,Prison Break), who shares Joan's gift. Despite critical kudos and respectable ratings,Joan of Arcadiawasn't picked up for a third season, but its spirit lives on in such disparate shows asMedium, in which a woman communicates with the dead, andMy Name Is Earl, in which a man goes around doing good deeds.

Retired superhero Captain Zoom (Tim Allen,The Shaggy Dog) gets pulled out of mothballs when the government decides to assemble a new team of super-powered kids. The motley quartet includes a herculean little girl (Ryan Newman), an invisible slacker (Michael Cassidy,The O.C.), a telekinetic hot chick (Kate Mara, 24), and a chunky lad whose body inflates to enormous size (Spencer Breslin,The Cat in the Hat, The Kid). But Zoom has lost his super-speed and gained a cynical chip on his shoulder; will he regain his faith in heroes in time to battle an impending menace? There's nothing original aboutZoom, but the engaging cast--which also includes Courteney Cox (Friends), Kevin Zegers (Transamerica), and Rip Torn (Men in Black, Forty Shades of Blue)--could have given some pep to a competent formulaic script.

{"description": "Formed in the early `90s, Damn Yankees featured guitarist Ted Nugent, Styx guitarist/vocalist Tommy Shaw, Night Ranger bassist/vocalist Jack Blades, and drummer Michael Cartellone. They released two platinum albums with a bunch of radio-friendly tracks and had a Top 5 hit with the ballad 'High Enough.' Originally released on VHS in 1992, and now on DVD for the first time, this features the band at it's peak in a live concert filmed at the Rocky Mountain Jam in Denver, Colorado. It is the only video footage available documenting this brief but popular union. The DVD Includes behind-the-scenes rehearsal and recording sessions, plus exclusive backstage footage and interviews with the band.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000E0OEVW", "B00001ODGR", "B0029W2V86", "B001CCKJ2E", "B0017CW5C6", "B00008L3ZO", "B00EUEWQ2W", "B0050JN7Z6", "B001J66TEK", "B00E5N8DX4", "B000286S9C", "B0053TWVFA", "B006EMSO74", "B00JQHOKSQ", "B0016FWLAA", "B000WUK1T8", "B004USUP12", "B00008HCB5", "B000MX7TRW", "B00K0HDE3I", "B000F8O49A", "B00E5N8DGG", "B0000C23F8", "B00IZDWZTS", "B0082SIPXQ", "B000M5KBJS", "B006IY4QPM", "B0001GWBGE", "B00005QBZD", "B0012YG7VO", "B002233X8E", "B0018M6J72", "B00FWSWQX4", "B00K6D1HSK", "B00FWSWEPY", "B00J0LH0XK", "B00DPH7QFM", "B00FKIB3XA", "B008VRCAY8", "B000008O7Z", "B000EQ47TK", "B00DPH7R56", "B008B3MZMY", "B00KS6EPKC", "B00D5YNQMW", "B00GC2KIK2", "B0085KGGLY", "B00005RZPK", "B00K6D1FZU", "B000V9KF8C", "B000O7861Y", "B00CA9VP0I", "B00FKIB808", "B008M6MG4W", "B0053TWUV0", "B00006L923", "B000E3LD72", "B00E5N8EHY", "B0000DJZAX", "B0000E2FLC", "B00JKJRGM2", "B00K0HDE7Y", "630463949X", "B00005NNSN", "B001E77XOE", "B004LSJCI8", "B000062XDH", "B009TSA6YE", "B00CXQL828", "B00J0LGZYU", "B00KOW49G0", "B00I7YGVNG", "B004USUOUO", "B00102FELM", "B000JCE3PC", "B004D2GMR6", "B000654ZJ6", "B00K7VLILM", "B00I4582E4", "B0003035CW", "B00KYQS520", "B003BQ1HP2", "B000BY8962", "B003YKVGL0", "B0007Z0VVQ", "B00CV920ZG", "B00KGYPY7Y", "B002MWHYKI", "B0000VV472", "B0012GMVSK", "B00FQ11PSO", "B00E5N8E2O", "B00F1W1SS0", "B00FR0GT9Y", "B0000TGADW", "B00CA4S0FQ", "B006ZEZ4CO", "B0000DJZB4", "B000068TOX", "B00E5N8E6K"], "bought_together": ["B000E0OEVW", "B001CCKJ2E"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0017CW5C6", "B000E0OEVW", "B00008L3ZO", "B00EUEWQ2W"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 95294}, "categories": [["CDs & Vinyl", "Classic Rock", "Arena Rock"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Metal"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Rock"], ["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 7.67, "brand": "WEA DVD", "asin": "B000LW7Z4G", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61gxtbx8imL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Damn Yankees - Uprising: Live!"}

{"description": "Not your typical star-studded or star-spangled war film, cult-fave director Samuel Fuller'sFixed Bayonetsis a viscerally thrilling  Korean War drama of one platoon's trial, and one corporal's baptism, under fire. Morale is high but the ammo is low for an American division hunkered down in the mountains of Korea. Certain massacre awaits if they retreat. To give \"15,000 men a break,\" 48 \"of our toughest combat men\" are selected to stay behind and trick the \"commies\" into thinking the entire division is in place while the others escape safely across a river.Fixed Bayonetsis raw and brutal in the best Fuller tradition. The backgrounds are obvious fakes, and the platoon members sport the usual war movie nicknames like Whitey, Rock, Jonesy, and \"Mr. Belvedere\" (he's the resident know-it-all). But all else has the authentic ring of reportage, as in a powerful scene when the men cluster together to rub their feet to ward off frostbite. Richard Basehart stars as Denno, who can \"take an order, but can't give one\" until his three superiors are knocked off one by one, leaving him in command. This rueful exchange--\"They told me this was going to be a police action.\" \"Why didn't they send the cops?\"--is as close as Fuller gets to geopolitics. For war-movie buffs, he does deliver pounding and tense action sequences. In one harrowing scene, a medic must navigate a minefield to try and rescue a wounded sergeant and retrieve the only map to the field.. But he is resolutely unsentimental and more interested in the ravaged, human face of war. These are faces you will not soon forget (one of them, reportedly, belongs to James Dean, but this film is so gripping, one is hard-pressed to make the effort to try to spot him).--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00CHYSSME", "0792841662", "B000NO1XJA", "B0015S2OWI", "B000NTPG66", "B000EHSVVO", "B000EHSVVE", "B00005PJ8K", "B00143XE0U", "B00096S4BM", "B0001NBMHQ", "B00H8J2NW4", "B00096S4B2", "B00005ASGB", "B0029778T8", "B00005OSJQ", "B000MGBLJG", "B005DIA0IQ", "B000QXDFS0", "B00HZOXRCC", "B00AEFXLKC", "B0007TKNLU", "B005HQBO9I", "B00C2535TE", "B007HCI42A", "B00005JN9P", "B000MGBLJ6", "B000EMGJFE", "B0007TKNDI", "B00008R9M6", "B000063URX", "B004VGHF7K", "B0001NBMGC", "B00008AOTO", "B000NTPG6Q", "B000E5N6KW", "B000H1RFSM", "B0008ENHU8", "B00005PJ8L", "B0085A9K62", "B00005B1YH", "B000EHSVV4", "B000MGBLIW", "B00KIZYDCI", "B000MRA542", "B0007TKNLA", "B00D3XMA9A", "B00005R23T", "B0002V8OAK", "B00BY0EBK0", "B0001FVDGE", "B000066C6H", "B005OTGS4E", "B00005B1YF", "B0001WTWWE", "B00008MTY1", "B003EYEEI8", "B0001NBMH6", "B002DNLT1Q", "B000063URW", "B000EHSVUK", "B0076XTIWU", "B005HQBO9S", "B000O78L0U", "B004R6EFAO", "B000A2WJBQ", "B004U7EIES", "B0001NBMI0", "B000062XEX", "B005DTZXMI", "B004GSVXBW", "B00008AOTR", "B00CZ7ALDM", "B00JX3SHIC", "B000E0WJN2", "B0005C9MQ6", "B00008PC0Z", "B004R6EF9U", "B003B3NV5E", "B0001FVDIC", "B004SJVQ4I", "B000NTPG5W", "B003GW94EM", "B008F0QBB4", "B0000AMRUP", "B00CHYSPJ0", "B004IFYMXO", "B00B27WRNI", "B005DKS1TE", "B00D3XM7H0", "0792841670", "B005H6RF8M", "B00KIZY3XW", "B00005N5S3", "B001PO55LE", "B004176JJY", "B00096S4DA", "B005MXQD4W", "B000EHSVSC", "B005L399BW"], "bought_together": ["B00CHYSSME"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00CHYSSME", "B007HCI42A", "B00C2535TE", "B0015S2OWI"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 79174}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.44, "brand": "BASEHART,RICHARD", "asin": "B000MGBLIC", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51s-tZY105L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Fixed Bayonets"}
