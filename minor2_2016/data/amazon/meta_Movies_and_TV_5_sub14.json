{"description": "Grab an econo-pack of tissues, gather your loved ones around a cozy  television, and bring on the hot cocoa--it's time for a dose of Christmas  spirit. The tender and charming Mary Steenburgen (Parenthood) dons a sour disposition in her role as Ginny Grainger, a woman who finds little joy in life  lately--let alone in the impending holiday season. Money is tight, her  husband (beautifully downplayed by nice-guy Gary Basaraba) lost his job,  and the family must move out of their house. Ginny cannot even bring  herself to say, \"Merry Christmas,\" despite her family's enthusiasm about  the big day. With help from Ginny's brave and loving daughter (sweetly  performed by Elisabeth Harnois) and a Christmas angel named Gideon (Harry Dean  Stanton), Ginny undergoes a life-altering experience &agrave; laIt's a Wonderful Life. The result? Happy endings, hugs and  kisses, pass the tissues.Not a light holiday entertainer by any means, the plot verges on  depressing at times, as the family struggles through money issues and the  tedium of daily suburban survival. While handled fairly subtly, some of  the bridging story--including a shooting, a kidnapping, and a  drowning--might prove disturbing to children under 6 years old. And  really: if the somber Harry Dean Stanton (Paris, Texas) repeatedly  appeared in your neighborhood, cloaked in a cowboy hat and overcoat,  would you allow your kids outside? Still, a well-made favorite to  cherish.--Liane Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301752627"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 392357}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.77, "brand": "", "asin": "0764007211", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51CE6WPRT4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "One Magic Christmas [VHS]"}
{"description": "Two bored businessmen, exiled to a remote company outpost on a  six-week business trip, decide to enliven their visit by romancing a  deaf woman and then savagely dumping her. Slimy Chad (Aaron Eckhart) convinces  schlumphy Howard (Matt Malloy) to take part in the vicious scheme by framing it as an act of revenge against uppity womankind, but it quickly becomes  apparent that he harbors some even more sinister motives. What might  have been a simple exploration (some, no doubt, would say reiteration)  of straightforward misogyny is elevated by the remarkable performance of  Eckhart; at once charming and nauseating, his fascinating  interpretation of pure competitive evil dominates the film. Neil LaBute's  intelligent script is somewhat reminiscent of Whit Stillman's darker  moments (minus the collegiate cleverness and zany warmth), and his  direction, while rarely visually impressive, does connote the hellish  impersonality of corporate interiors with chilling success. The  director-screenwriter deserves additional plaudits for resisting  both the tidal pull toward poetic justice and the temptation to draw  either of his main characters as even slightly sympathetic. A study in  ugliness, a rubbernecker's delight, a time bomb.--Miles Bethany", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 535404}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.89, "brand": "", "asin": "076780094X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514R3NGHH0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "In the Company of Men [VHS]"}

{"description": "Despite rave reviews as one of the most stylish and intelligent detective pictures in a number of years, this 1995 adaptation of Walter Mosley's novel never found a mass audience. Too bad, because Carl Franklin's film is nearly perfect in every way, from its rich, shadowy look to its depiction of life in post-World War II black America (L.A.-style) to the acting of Denzel Washington, Don Cheadle, and others. Washington plays Easy Rawlins, an aircraft factory worker who is laid off only to find his true calling: as a private eye, albeit an unlicensed one. Hired to find a missing woman, he becomes entangled in a complex but satisfying case involving sex, corruption, racism, and of course money. Top-notch from top to bottom--and Cheadle is dangerously funny as Easy's best friend, a killer named Mouse.--Marshall Fine", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000542CJ", "6304884400", "B0000549B2", "B00441GZ1Y", "B000244GCC", "B00BTYOYG2", "B0001VTPUO", "B0000VJG72", "B003BV8I3Q", "B0006210ZG", "B00008WJEY", "B004YCKJGU", "B000OT6V0K", "0783230532", "6304765258", "0743451791", "B00005JA9F", "B002GHHHN8", "B00005JPD0", "B000N60HAO", "B00015HVJM", "078324228X", "B00005JLRZ", "630514415X", "0792838076", "B0050MB4OO", "B00005RDAO", "0800177967", "B00125WAWS", "0800141806", "B00L2FSQ08", "B00005AUK9", "B00AEFY6TW", "B0009S4IGA", "B000P0J0CE", "B000BOH8X2", "B000B8TIKY", "B002CPMB9O", "B002LMV7R0", "B00007L4KF", "B00AEFXN9G", "B000GFLKF8", "0743451767", "B00AEFYLBU", "B005KKVAH2", "B00AFEXRME", "B0041QSZS8", "B000002B1D", "B00441GYXI", "B00005JN0W", "0783240295", "B00005JL72", "B00005OSKB", "B00007AJG1", "079074208X", "B00AEBB9N2", "6305505802", "B000244EX8", "B002VWNICC", "B002NZK5UU", "B00441GZ00", "0743451775", "B0000633QV", "B0002V7O5Q", "B005LAIGRS", "B0001XAQ96", "0767811070", "B00005JKWX", "0767818083", "B000065V3J", "B000JJSL1W", "B00124ONGA", "B002VWNIEA", "B00AEFYG3S", "B002CA68N4", "B000XJD34I", "B00005JLX8", "B00066FAQW", "0385535988", "038553597X", "B00005JD5J", "B000059TGC", "B00005U156", "B000ION79E", "B00003L9CG", "B000E40QC4", "B0000TWMQ6", "B004TTOQ4O", "B000VNMMVQ", "6305505780", "B00CP4Y5WS", "0743442547", "B000051YMP", "B002CWKU2M", "B00GOZ2LPM", "0446617903", "B0009GX1CE", "B00005JLG1", "B000GTJSD0", "B000JJSLA8"], "bought_together": ["B00441GZ1Y", "B003BV8I3Q"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001D7T6CM", "B00DDT0J92", "B00128GITG", "6304884400"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 59172}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 44.99, "brand": "WASHINGTON,DENZEL", "asin": "0767818075", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51lYS%2BR4XVL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Devil in A Blue Dress"}

What he discovers is a twisted realm of sexual bondage and dark violence. And when a series of other men turn up bound and murdered, Wilson's obsession with finding the killer mounts.

{"description": "Welcome back one of the treasures of international cinema.  In 1929-30, when  Hollywood was stymied by the arrival of talkies, a Frenchman named Ren&eacute; Clair  set about reinventing the movies for the world of sound.  Rather than enslave  his camera--and imagination--to a microphone in a potted palm, Clair embraced  sound as a liberating new dimension of the motion picture.  His effervescent  comedy-musical-romanceLe Milliondoesn't just feature a witty commingling of  dialogue and song--it's ajeu d'espritin which every movement, every cut,  every sound effect (or absence thereof) contributes to a lilting rhythm.The plot is precisely as airy and as farcically complicated as it needs to  be.  Suffice it to say that there's this threadbare jacket with a winning  lottery ticket in the pocket.  It becomes separated from its starving-artist  owner and leads him and numerous others a merry chase over the roofs of  Paris, through the urban underworld, and onto the very stage of the Opera.  You'll wonder more than once whether the Marx Brothers were taking notes.For no good reason whatsoever,Le Millionremained out of  circulation for decades, except for a few bleary dupe  videos.

{"description": "This tearjerker by Australian filmmaker Scott Hicks is a surprising story about real-life classical pianist David Helfgott, an Australian who rose to international prominence at a very young age in the 1950s and '60s, and suffered a psychological collapse after enduring years of abuse from his father (Armin Mueller-Stahl). Hicks has three very fine actors portraying Helfgott at different stages of his life, including the adorably wry and goofy Noah Taylor (Flirting), who takes up the character's teen years, and Oscar winner Geoffrey Rush, giving a great performance playing the musician as a schizophrenic adult. Despite the Helfgotts' compromised psychological health,Shineis hardly a depressing experience. If anything, the story is really about how long one person's life can take to make glorious sense of itself.  Sir John Gielgud, in golden form, plays Helfgott's teacher. The DVD release presents the film in its widescreen format, and also includes a Q&A; with director Hicks and Rush's Golden Globes acceptance speech.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["6304178352"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 346753}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.99, "brand": "", "asin": "078061755X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/511XSN265HL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Shine [VHS]"}
{"description": "Edward Norton was nominated for a 1998 Best Actor Oscar for his role as  Derek Vinyard, a thoughtful kid turned neo-Nazi after his father is slain.  Edward Furlong plays his younger brother, Danny, determined to follow in his brother's footsteps.  The easy routes the film seems prepared to take never materialize.  It continually makes Derek's transformation both in and out of his racist beliefs believable and persuasive.  Stacy Keach is given the head vampire role of the local skinhead chapter, Cameron, and he's the closest this film comes to an overt overstatement.  Norton, however, is fantastic, embodying a person who roller-coasters through hatred like he can't wait to ride again.  His diatribes are not unlike what can be heard on any given conservative radio station on any given day, but he doesn't spew them as cant or screed.  Only when his violent emotions take charge, negating any sense or stand, is the underlying fallacy and nature of his beliefs made plain. This film was undermined by the film's own director, Tony Kaye, who made such a braying ass of himself and his work that it distorted the public's view of what is an interesting social and psychological lesson in the war between ideas and ideologues, reason and racism.--Keith Simanton", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303686796", "B00004W5UA", "B00000J2L7"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 321982}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.59, "brand": "", "asin": "0780625129", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516KFV9DGKL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "American History X [VHS]"}
{"description": "Repeated viewings can't dispel the shock of the final scene in this classic 1941 romantic mystery--a brief but disorienting confrontation that suddenly inverts the heroine's mounting conviction that she's married a murderer, forcing us to reconsider virtually every scene and line of dialogue that's preceded it. It's a masterful coup de grace for director Alfred Hitchcock, who has built a puzzle around the corrosive power of suspicion, threaded with deft ambiguities that toy with dramatic conventions and character archetypes in nearly every frame.As embodied by Joan Fontaine, who nabbed an Oscar in this second outing with the director, Lina McLaidlaw is a buttoned-up, bookish heiress whose prim exterior conceals longings for a more engaged emotional life. Her solution materializes in the darkly handsome Johnnie Aysgarth, a gambler, womanizer, and spendthrift who flirts, then pursues, and soon marries her. As Aysgarth, Cary Grant is both irresistible and sinister, capable of deceit and petty theft, as well as grander designs on his bride's impending fortune. Lina's passion for Johnnie is clouded by each new revelation about his apparent dishonesty, from clandestine gambling to real estate development schemes; more troubling are clues implicating him in the death of his best friend, and the prospect that Johnnie may be slowly poisoning Lina herself. By the time we see him ascending a darkened staircase with a suspicious glass of milk, an image made all the more indelible through the spectral glow the director captures in the glass, the evidence seems damning indeed.In fact, even as Hitchcock stacks the deck against Johnnie, and takes full advantage of Grant's skill at conveying such menace, the director also dots his landscape with visual clues to Lina's own neurotic (and erotic) obsessions. The final scene forces us to reevaluate her behavior while leaving enough of a cloud over Johnnie to rob him, and us, of a complete exoneration. It's a wicked, unsettling payoff to a brilliantly executed thriller.--Sam Sutherland", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300183513", "B00000F3UB", "0790743213", "6304039530", "0782006779", "630266232X", "B0000040EO", "6302413435", "0783222955", "6303120504", "080013222X"], "also_viewed": ["B00AEBB97S", "B000UVV25Q", "B000CCW2TS", "B001D8W7EK", "B001D8W7F4", "B008D1Q1VU", "B007N5YJWK", "B0002HOERG", "B000A9QK7I", "B004H83IFU", "B004UOHNAC", "B00DNQA16G", "B008D1R52E", "B007FQXEVY", "B007FQXEQO", "B001KXZGOG", "B006H37P2K", "B00DNQM7N6"]}, "price": 4.39, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 447983}, "asin": "0780626702", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41YM01J4SGL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Suspicion [VHS]"}

{"description": "In the vastly overrated 1998 bookEasy Riders, Raging Bulls, author Peter Biskind puts the blame for Hollywood's blockbuster mentality at least partially on Steven Spielberg's box-office success with this adaptation of Peter Benchley's bestselling novel. But you can't blame Spielberg for making a terrific movie, whichJawsdefinitely is. The story of a Long Island town whose summer tourist business is suddenly threatened by great-white-shark attacks on humans bypasses the potboiler trappings of Benchley's book and goes straight for the jugular with beautifully crafted, crowd-pleasing sequences of action and suspense supported by a trio of terrific performances by Roy Scheider (as the local sheriff), Richard Dreyfuss (as a shark specialist), and particularly Robert Shaw (as the old fisherman who offers to hunt the shark down). The sequences on Shaw's boat--as the three of them realize that in fact the shark is huntingthem--are what entertaining moviemaking is all about.--Marshall Fine", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005B6ND", "6300183181", "0784011923", "0767825411", "6305814694", "B00000JGEI", "6303148352", "6303506291", "630018403X", "B00000490M", "6300214753", "6304932553", "630442972X", "6300269639", "B0000048S1", "B000005PFL", "6302765536", "6302091632", "6302824729", "6303344224", "6301570723", "6300247171", "B00008WFU5", "6305576173", "6300183467", "0790743213", "6304143184", "6303402348", "1558808221", "6303020089", "B000063UUL", "B00005B238", "6303212379", "B00005A8XX", "0790731436", "0783226152", "0790705141", "6300267881", "B00008WFU4", "6300181340", "630157401X", "6302921058", "6300214060", "6302968143", "1558802258", "0792102320", "6300214087", "6300268993", "B0000BWVBD", "B002GHHHL0", "6301888901", "B00005JKDQ", "6303122647", "6302800420", "6303610811", "6301827732", "6303540082", "6302374189", "0800198395", "6300214435", "6304071876", "6301208773", "B00000IO4G", "B00006G8LB", "B0087ZG7HK", "B00008DZ83", "6300214710", "6300215814", "630220366X", "6304457324", "0800116917", "B000059XY5", "6303212263", "6300216500", "6303236863", "630533577X", "6300213986", "6302415853", "6304935811", "6302820448", "B00004U8P4", "6300214311", "6301798503", "0793927501", "6300214370", "6302787564", "6304288433", "6300182878", "B000003KHS", "6301971809", "B000007OY0", "0790734079", "630336568X", "0790733927", "0790742322", "6301966988", "0764006770", "B000059XVO", "B00023BLXA"], "also_viewed": ["B00008WFU5", "6301792734", "6305814694", "B00005B6ND", "0784011923", "0767825411", "6300214060", "6300183181", "6300247171", "B00005A8XX", "6303506291", "B00006AL1C", "0792151712", "6304539258", "630018403X", "6305363668", "B00008WFU4", "B00000JGEI", "B00078XGO2", "6304117752", "6301574117", "0800116917", "B000005PPB", "B0056BE0SG", "6302091632", "080010367X", "6304143184", "6300216845", "6304539274", "6303148352", "0792158261", "B00000JS61", "0792839846", "6303212379", "0792837614", "0783222955", "0783221347", "0790700506", "6302921058", "6301797906", "6301976983", "6305123616", "6303402070", "6304429274", "1558807780", "B00005JKDQ", "6300214370", "6302936381", "B00000JGEK", "B0000AQZYM", "B00000JXVM", "B0007KTBIU", "0790734079", "6304039522", "6300214753", "B00005NCCP", "B005FHWWXQ", "B0087F7VSY", "B00KDU8HQQ"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 177995}, "asin": "0783216084", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514JQY1K3TL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Jaws [VHS]"}

{"description": "Woody Allen as a worker ant with an inferiority complex? Sylvester Stallone as an affable soldier ant who discovers that digging tunnels is cool? The animation playground we all knew so well is turning into a theme park full of in-jokes for grownups.Antzexplores age-old topics (one person--err, insect--can make a difference, individuality and social responsibility must exist side by side, war is hell) with comic asides and Woody Allen's funniest quips this side of PG (adults will chuckle at the socialist slogans bandied about as he campaigns for workers' rights). Sharon Stone voices the rebellious princess with a fun-loving streak that doesn't quite overcome her royal bearing and court training, but she can learn. Gene Hackman is all teeth (ants have teeth?) and menacing grins as the Army general plotting insect-icide. This bug's-eye view of life on Earth gives Allen's neurotic nonconformist an epic adventure of microscopic proportions: a devastating war with a termite colony, an odyssey to the fabled land of plenty (a picnic ground), and a race to save his fellow workers from certain death. Other voices include Anne Bancroft as the Queen, Christopher Walken, Jennifer Lopez, Danny Glover, Dan Aykroyd, Jane Curtin, and John Mahoney. The computer animation isn't exactly realistic but feels as solid and contoured as puppet animation with the smoothness and slickness of traditional cel cartoons, and the character designs and animation offer a marvelous range of expressions. The PG rating includes a gritty battle sequence that may frighten youngsters.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00007LVCM", "B0012EM5D8", "B00003CXJ4", "B0006JMLRK", "B000ION23A", "B00005JNQS", "B000MV9026", "B000M343BC", "B000RMJ4F8", "B005SDUV4E", "B0006UEVT0", "B0000640SC", "B004HO6I4M", "B001DPHDCY", "B002WJI2QQ", "B00CWM58WY", "B0000AOX0O", "B00003CXG7", "B00BG0RSJ4", "B005LAIISA", "6305161887", "B00029LO0Y", "B0000VV4W2", "B000AY74OG", "B007FF3HQM", "B008NNY9QW", "B001GCUO7A", "B0039N74CW", "B003E66Y84", "B006JD48LO", "B004EPZ034", "B000L22SG6", "B000H7JCK0", "B001PR0YEE", "B001U3D88M", "B00BTYSIWI", "B00CHVJODE", "B000A2WAQK", "B001LPWGFA", "B003H9M1Q2", "B00000JGOQ", "B0013FSL3E", "B00B7EQPNE", "B001GCUNWQ", "B00AFEX83C", "B000VBJEEG", "B00AEFXMSS", "B00CTNYLQA", "B000065V42", "B000056H26", "B0030IIZ4M", "B001ILFUD2", "B0084IHVGG", "B000CZ0PT4", "B00365F6I2", "B0046A9RMM", "B00E9ZATJO", "B00JK531ES", "B00000JL8E", "B003UMW63E", "B00ALMNCLQ", "B000BITUVG", "B00EBBGLFC", "B0084IHVUC", "B001ECQ75A", "B00004YNUM", "B00005TN8K", "B00AEFYO08", "B005LAIHW2", "B000EQ5UHS", "B000UFIYOO", "B001OMU6UM", "B00009M9BK", "B001NCDFTW", "B000UVKGPI", "B0042U94UQ", "B00009YXAW", "B0013FSWT2", "B005LAIH4A", "B004A8ZX0K", "B000E33W0S", "B000DWMYQ8", "B000AAF1TU", "B00005RDSQ", "B000ROAK2W", "B001ILFUDC", "B000GUJZ00", "0783219806", "B00HLTD2OE", "B000089773", "B001FAFO3W", "B000035Z48", "B0084IHVN4", "B00CQRN3QI", "B001HN6918", "B00005JN4W", "B00004R99S", "B00F522C7C", "B001PR0Y7Q", "B004LWZW7Y"], "bought_together": ["B00007LVCM"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00007LVCM", "B00CWM58WY", "B004HO6I4M", "B0011ZNAIC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 6637}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.81, "brand": "Dreamworks Skg", "asin": "0783231474", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51iCc1u153L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Antz"}

{"description": "Released in late 1999,The Bone Collectorwas originally promoted as a thriller in the tradition ofThe Silence of the LambsandSeven, suggesting that it would earn a place among those earlier, better films. Nice try, but no cigar.The Bone Collectorsettles instead for mere competence and the modest rewards of a well-handled formula. With a terrific cast at his service, director Phillip Noyce (Dead Calm,Patriot Games) turns the pulpy indulgence of Jeffery Deaver's novel into a slick potboiler that is grisly fun only if you don't pick it apart.Noyce expertly builds palpable tension around a series of gruesome murders that lead us into the darkest nooks of New York City. Now a bedridden quadriplegic prone to life-threatening seizures and suicidal depression, forensics detective Lincoln Rhyme (Denzel Washington) gets a new lease on life with a sharp young beat cop (Angelina Jolie) who's a wizard at analyzing crime scenes. She does field work while he deciphers clues from his high-tech Manhattan loft, and as they narrow the search their lives are increasingly endangered. As this formulaic plot grows moldy, Noyce resorts to narrative shortcuts, using perfunctory scenes to manipulate the viewer and taking morbid pleasure in his revelation of the murder scenes. And yet it all works, to a point, and the cast (including Queen Latifah and Luiz Guzm&aacute;n) is much better than the material.

{"description": "Peter Panhas a special place in the realm of classic animated  Disney films: it instills an element of childlike wonder. The 1953 version of James M. Barrie's story is colorfully told and keeps on the straight and narrow of the book. Barrie's wondrous focus on child's play is the key to its longevity: kids who don't grow up, shadows that run away from their owners, pirates, a fairy, and the magic ability to fly. In short, you can't help wishing the adventure would happen to you. Fueled by a few memorable songs (the stunner being \"You Can Fly\") and the strong impression of the pixie fairy Tinkerbell and the goofy Captain Hook, Disney's version of this story neither supplants nor lessens the Broadway version with Mary Martin that was produced for television the same decade.

As with the firstBatmanfeature, director Tim Burton brings his distinct visual style to the frantic action, but this time there's a darker malevolence lurking beneath all that extraordinary production design.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000P0J06K", "B001OST0LW", "B001OST0M6", "B00005JNJV", "B004LWZWGA", "B001GZ6QC4", "B00005LOUK", "B000IJ79WU", "B001ECDVKE", "B000IJ79XE", "B0000959N0", "B0006L0LOS", "B000IJ79X4", "B000A9QKLO", "B00AEBBA72", "B0000VD04M", "B0000AC8LI", "B000IJ79UW", "B00008G8M5", "B004LWZWFQ", "B000A9QKL4", "B004LWZW42", "B008JFUPFI", "B000AYELVA", "B001CDR1FG", "B001AGXEAG", "B000J10EQU", "B001DHXT20", "B00005JMQW", "B002VWNIDG", "B004SIP9O2", "B004YJMQHI", "B0087ZG7NO", "B000AQOHNA", "B000AYELVU", "B00005JKCH", "B00GZ0ML2Y", "B00005JNTU", "B000UR9T8C", "B001VLBDD0", "B00DP9MDE4", "B001CK1D44", "B00AEBBAEK", "B000A9QKLE", "B007K3JFUQ", "B000VI70QS", "B00004Y87O", "B009JBWOU0", "B002GHHHOM", "B00005JKWJ", "B001QB9H1U", "B003UGLCIA", "B00007AJGH", "B0009UZG28", "B004SIP9P6", "B000035Z5H", "B00A2LFXVI", "0780630890", "B0000696I0", "B004EPZ07K", "B001OQCV6A", "B000VR0570", "B004EPYZT4", "B000OT6V64", "B001GCUO1Q", "B000RIWAVW", "6304698739", "B000O77SRC", "B000IJ79VQ", "B0014Z4ON4", "0780624890", "B004SIP6WW", "B005LAIH54", "B00003CY5Y", "B0000VCZMK", "6305869103", "B0001BKAEY", "B0090SI56Y", "B000068MBS", "B004SIP9MY", "B00AEBB9NM", "B0001GOH6Q", "B004LWZW4M", "B000GETUDI", "B000B7QCGS", "B000CSTK42", "B000FFJYBG", "B008JFUS0U", "B000RW3VCK", "B005LAIHYU", "B00005T7I2", "B0000B00KB", "B00E5I2M6I", "B001DTPZNY", "B004P7CN7W", "B001BGS17Q", "B001AJIHC8", "B005COPWZW", "B005G4TJUC", "B001QTXM5Y"], "bought_together": ["B000P0J06K", "B001OST0LW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002GSXKN8", "B000P0J06K", "B00005JNJV", "B001OST0LW"]}, "price": 8.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 142329}, "asin": "0790730960", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41SK0R2QFEL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Batman Returns (1992)"}

{"description": "Thanks to the ambitious vision of director Tim Burton, the blockbuster hit of 1989 delivers the goods despite an occasionally spotty script, giving the caped crusader a thorough overhaul in keeping with the crime fighter's evolution in DC Comics. Michael Keaton strikes just the right mood as the brooding &quot;Dark Knight&quot; of Gotham City; Kim Basinger plays Gotham's intrepid reporter Vicki Vale; and Jack Nicholson goes wild as the maniacal and scene-stealing Joker, who plots a takeover of the city with his lethal Smilex gas. Triumphant Oscar-winning production design by the late Anton Furst turnsBatmaninto a visual feast, and Burton brilliantly establishes a darkly mythic approach to Batman's legacy. Danny Elfman's now-classic score propels the action with bold, muscular verve.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000P0J06U", "B001OST0LW", "B001OST0M6", "B00005JNJV", "B001GZ6QC4", "B000IJ79UW", "B004LWZWGA", "B00005LOUK", "B001AGXEAG", "B000IJ79WU", "B0000VD04M", "B00005JKCH", "B000IJ79XE", "B00AEBBA72", "B000IJ79X4", "B002VWNIDG", "B004LWZW42", "B00005JMQW", "B004LWZWFQ", "B001CK1D44", "B000J10EQU", "B009JBWOU0", "B0000AC8LI", "B0006L0LOS", "6304698739", "B001VLBDD0", "B001ECDVKE", "B0000959N0", "B008JFUPFI", "B000EGDB10", "B00LBHOCHS", "B0087ZG7HK", "B000OT6V64", "6304711891", "B002VWNID6", "B000AQOHNA", "B000AYELVA", "B00F4FFO8E", "B000A9QKL4", "B00DP9MDE4", "B00005JNTU", "B000BZISVM", "0780630890", "0780630882", "B0014Z4ON4", "B000RW3VCK", "B000P0J0AG", "B0090SI56Y", "B002GSXKN8", "B00005N7Z1", "B000AYELVU", "B001GCUO1Q", "B00005R2IS", "B004FQX5B6", "0790731924", "B00AEBB9NM", "B00007AJGH", "B00005T7I1", "B000P0J0A6", "B000M341QE", "B000P0J09M", "0792844866", "B004SIP95G", "B000VI70QS", "B004L9GMBC", "B00027JZ3E", "B0001BKAEY", "B000A9QKLE", "B0014C2FX8", "B000V4UFZK", "B003XURDAY", "B00008G8M5", "B00070FX5U", "B00GZ0ML2Y", "B000O77SQS", "B004SIP9Z6", "B0007G89FU", "B000UR9T8C", "B001QB9H1U", "B000RTB0R6", "B00177YA1K", "B00008G8M4", "B004SIP9O2", "B00AEBB9FA", "B00005ATZT", "B000FS9FCG", "B0009UZG28", "B000P0J09W", "B001CDR1FG", "B00005N5S5", "6305767866", "B0087F7VSY", "B00081912E", "B001TK80C0", "0780630858", "B004YJMQHI", "B00AEBB9DM", "B007K3JFUQ", "6304712987", "B0001GOH6Q"], "bought_together": ["B000P0J06U", "B001OST0LW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002GSXKN8", "B00005JNJV", "B000B5XOSO", "B00C2IGQBA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 141600}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.0, "brand": "WARNER STUDIOS", "asin": "0790729652", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41SYDPY4YPL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Batman (1989)"}

{"description": "One of the key films of the 1970s, John Boorman'sDeliveranceis a nightmarish adaptation of poet-novelist James Dickey's book about various kinds of survival in modern America. The story concerns four Atlanta businessmen of various male stripe: Jon Voight's character is a reflective, civilized fellow, Burt Reynolds plays a strapping hunter-gatherer in urban clothes, Ned Beatty is a sweaty, weak-willed boy-man, and Ronny Cox essays a spirited, neighborly type. Together they decide to answer the ancient call of men testing themselves against the elements and set out on a treacherous ride on the rapids of an Appalachian river. What they don't understand until it is too late is that they have ventured into Dickey's variation on the American underbelly, a wild, lawless, dangerous (and dangerously inbred) place isolated from the gloss of the late 20th century. In short order, the four men dig deep into their own suppressed primitiveness, defending themselves against armed cretins, facing the shock of real death on their carefully planned, death-defying adventure, and then squarely facing the suspicions of authority over their concealed actions. Boorman, a master teller of stories about individuals on peculiarly mythical journeys, does a terrifying and beautiful job of revealing the complexity of private and collective character--the way one can never be the same after glimpsing the sharp-clawed survivor in one's soul.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00000FZCU", "6305123616", "0783222955", "6300214060"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 659130}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 10.0, "brand": "", "asin": "0790732009", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/513K3CXF8QL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Deliverance (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]"}
{"description": "The 1994 box-office hit that turned comedy maniac Jim Carrey into Hollywood's first $20-million man, this gag-filled no-brainer stars Carrey as the titular rubber-faced gumshoe who tracks down lost pets for his heartbroken clients. Ace's latest case involves the apparent kidnapping of the Miami Dolphins' team mascot, Snowflake the dolphin (natch). His investigation is a source of constant aggravation for Miami police lieutenant Lois Einhorn (Sean Young), who turns out to be packing more than a pistol under her skirt.Friendsfans will appreciate the presence of Courtney Cox, who remains admirably straight-faced as the Dolphins' publicist and Ace's would-be girlfriend, but of course it's Carrey who steals the show with shameless abandon. One viewing may suffice for a lot of people, but Carrey's hyper antics have madeAce Ventura: Pet Detectiveone of the bestselling videos of the 1990s.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000P0J06A", "B000BKJ762", "B00081912E", "0783235070", "0800141687", "B00AEBBA2C", "B00003CXE4", "B002BIULKS", "B008R65XUQ", "B003PIUIHO", "B00AEFXIUK", "B00AEBB9DM", "B002BIULL2", "630529142X", "B0000AKCKI", "B00AEBB9SM", "6304696221", "B008R65XTC", "B0006GANPA", "B001SN78JO", "B000QQLVPQ", "B00005JM4Q", "B00005JL93", "B00001U0BN", "B0009HBPN0", "B00005JKCB", "B0009X760U", "B00000K3U4", "B00005JMYI", "B000HT386M", "B003CRM6PA", "B00HZMZ2FE", "B00005JLRB", "B00000K3UU", "B004P7CNUY", "B002GSXKOW", "B00005T7HZ", "B001OST0LW", "B0009X761E", "B00AEFXJS6", "B00AEBB9K0", "B0009IOR5M", "B00AEBB99Q", "B002ZG9800", "B00005N5SA", "B001AGXEAG", "B00003CXPS", "B00004RJ73", "B00AEFYS2M", "B00AEFYPXY", "B00AEFYZCU", "0783233515", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00003CXO1", "B00407PO3W", "B000P0J09W", "B00AEBB8LK", "B00028HBES", "B000Z8GZYW", "6305433925", "0783227388", "B001G5T6GW", "B00005PJ6N", "B00AEFXDO6", "B000E8N8H0", "B00015YVDG", "B004SIP9MY", "B000OYC7BW", "B000K405CY", "B00AEFYVMO", "B000ELJAEM", "B00005N5SB", "B00004TJMW", "B002GHHHGU", "0800141741", "B006JN8798", "B001CK1D44", "B001JV5AZE", "B002ZG99H2", "B00AKGG828", "B00158K0QU", "B00AEFXP8K", "B0008JIJ2O", "B000AP04L0", "B000P0J0A6", "B0087ZG7HK", "B000P0J09M", "B000J4P9P8", "B002AF4Y9G", "B000P0J06K", "B00AEFXXMI", "B00AEFXO8Q", "B0002RQ0XC", "B00005JLQE", "B00BTYSIWI", "B00AEFYKWU", "B00AEFYPAC", "B004H83IM8", "B0018AQ2RG", "6304711867"], "bought_together": ["B000P0J06A", "B000BKJ762"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002BIULKS", "B006HGXGWA", "B004H83IJQ", "B000P0J06A"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 22438}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.84, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "0790732157", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51vFutW%2BG1L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective"}
{"description": "One of the funniest films in many a moon was hiding at art house  theaters in 1998. FormerSaturday Night Livecomedian and Spinal Tap member Christopher Guest creates the ultimate parody of small-town dramatics,Waiting for Guffman. Corky St. Claire (Guest), an overwhelming drama director hiding out in Blaine, Missouri, thinks he has found the vehicle to put him back on Broadway:  the city's 150th anniversary play,Red, White, and Blaine.As rehearsals start, we learn of the town's history (\"the stool capital of the world\") including a brush with a UFO. The mockumentary follows the various townsfolk wishing for stardom: Parker Posey as a Dairy Queen clerk, Catherine O'Hara and Fred Willard as stage-struck travel agents, Matthew Keeslar as the town's bad boy, and Eugene Levy (who cowrote the film with Guest) as a dentist who dreams of glory on the stage. The film is a hoot from beginning to end, and be sure to watch the closing credits. Fans of Guest's deft dry humor should not miss his other parody of the entertainment world,The Big Picture(Kevin Bacon as a student filmmaker who goes to Hollywood).--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005ALS0", "B0000ALFVD", "B000M341Q4", "B00005NKC9", "6305922756", "B0007UC8Y4", "B0000ALFVE"], "bought_together": ["B00005ALS0", "B0000ALFVD"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 288595}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.45, "brand": "", "asin": "079073155X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51MCNQ0AY9L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Waiting for Guffman [VHS]"}

{"description": "Winner of the Academy Award&reg; for best picture of 1989, this gracefully moving drama, adapted from the hit play by Alfred Uhry, chronicles the 25-year friendship between a stubborn, aging Southern widow (Jessica Tandy) and her loyal chauffeur (Morgan Freeman). At first, the self-sufficient Miss Daisy is reluctant to accept the services of a chauffeur, but Hoke is quiet, wise, and tolerant, and as the years pass the unlikely friends develop a deep mutual respect and admiration. Tandy deservedly won the Oscar for her sassy and sensitive performance, and Freeman earned an Oscar nomination for bringing quiet depth and integrity to his memorable role. Ironically, director Bruce Beresford (Tender Mercies) was not nominated, but the film won Oscars for makeup and for Uhry's screenplay, in addition to a supporting actor nomination for Dan Aykroyd as Daisy's supportive son. Delicate, funny, and bittersweet,Driving Miss Daisywas a surprise hit when released, and marked the crowning achievement of Tandy's great career.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305212112", "B0000JBALO", "B00004TJKK", "076780676X", "B00005NRN8", "B003ASLJK4", "B00AEBB9FA", "0783240171", "B00AEFY0F2", "B000P0J092", "B00001W9G0", "B004A8ZWVK", "B006FE83UE", "B000765IJK", "B004SIP7F8", "B001VC99HQ", "B00DDT0JB0", "B00AEFXYOA", "B000TXP56C", "B004SEUJOQ", "B000YAF4MA", "B004FQX5A2", "B001ECDVJU", "0767836359", "B003LMPKSQ", "B00AEFXD1O", "B002M2Z3BA", "B004AOECXI", "B00AEFY4CG", "6305128952", "0800141806", "B00004XPPC", "B00005MEOU", "B002NZK5RS", "B0045HCJ76", "B00006G8GZ", "B008B9JTFO", "B000JYW5B4", "B001ECDVK4", "6305236569", "6305428352", "B00AFEYJ80", "B000XJD34I", "6305133468", "B001NLJ3NU", "B00AEFYK5M", "B002VWNICM", "B00AATV07S", "B00020HAV0", "B007SPPANM", "B00020HAWE", "B000PHVZNE", "B002VECM6S", "B000065FJC", "B002VWNIAY", "B00011D1OU", "B00006RCO2", "B004SIP6C2", "B0010AN7Z4", "B000E6ESI0", "B0045HCJJY", "B0000YTP02", "6305213283", "B000EHRVOW", "6304907729", "B00K6D1QV8", "B00404ME1A", "B000JU8H9C", "B00EV4EUT8", "B000059HAN", "B00005AUKE", "B0009S4IKQ", "B005HWAOP2", "B007N31YH0", "B00AEFY9GW", "B000QQLVPQ", "B000KJTGHO", "B00AEBBACM", "630471193X", "B000244GCW", "B002HK9IDQ", "B000YDBPAM"], "bought_together": ["6305212112", "B0000JBALO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0000JBALO", "6305212112", "B00DDT0JB0", "B003ASLJK4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 77014}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 18.95, "brand": "", "asin": "0790730987", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4161YA15GNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Driving Miss Daisy"}

{"description": "Running time 127 minutes, Black and White, with original theatrical trailer. Starring Humphrey Bogart and Walter Huston, Tim Holt and Bruce Bennett, directed by John Huston.\n\nGold in the hills, avarice in the hearts of men. Two hard-luck drifters (Bogart and Holt) and a grizzled prospector (Huston) discover gold. Then greed and paranoia set in.\n\nShot mostly on location in Mexico, The Treasure of the Sierra Madre cost a then-whopping $3 million - and led to a showdown. At that price, Jack Warner argued, the top-billed Bogart shouldn't be bumped off before the finale. But director John Huston stood his ground and went on to win high honors: two Academy Awards for his direction and screenplay. And his father won the Oscar as Best Supporting Actor. Without awards, but with enduring acclaim, is Bogart's performance, transforming before our eyes from a likable hobo to a heartless thug who simmers in his own greed. A half-century later, its placement on the American Film Institute's Top 100 American Film list confirms it's still a powerful movie.", "related": {"also_bought": ["0790743159", "6301968948", "6301797906", "0783222955", "B000BWIZRW", "B000BWIZTU", "6304429274", "6303402070", "0800100832", "6301978110", "6304196954", "6304111398", "630150528X", "6302816254", "B00000F13T", "0792839846", "6301977165", "6302227127", "6303109950", "6302158176", "630233683X", "0792837371", "6302353785", "630018627X", "6302032245", "0790734079", "B00005A1VH", "0792837967", "0800125762", "B00000FZCU", "6300215512", "0800132009", "0792837630", "6301801954", "630266232X", "0790743531", "6302226899", "1558807780", "1569942072", "6301800974", "6302909023", "6304259131", "6301805615", "6301798759", "B000PYKZYC", "B000006914", "0790748169", "6303393985", "6300216012", "6300268470", "B000077VT7"], "bought_together": ["0790743159"], "also_viewed": ["6305123616", "0783216084", "6303402070", "6304429274", "6301797906", "1558807780"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 418473}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.0, "brand": "", "asin": "0790743523", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HQXK3ZV4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre [VHS]"}

{"description": "Any Given Sunday, Oliver Stone's salute-cum-expos&#xE9; of pro football, belabors some pretty obvious points for nigh onto three hours; but between the frenetic editing, the pounding rap-music beats, and several flashy performances, it's certainly never dull. Al Pacino, coach of the fictional Miami Sharks (the NFL declined involvement in this production), struggles with the most time-honored of sports movie dilemmas: what to do with the old friend who's past his prime and the young hotshot who could save the franchise but first has to learn what being a team player is all about. Comedian Jamie Foxx does a marvelous dramatic turn as the rookie quarterback whose ego and talent are equally impressive, while Pacino seems more at ease in Oliver Stone Land than any actor since regular James Woods (on hand as well as a sleazy team doctor). Prowling the sidelines, shouting spittle-flecked orders, seizing up in almost physical pain when a play goes the wrong way, Pacino is as unashamedly--and entertainingly--hyperbolic as Stone's whirling montages of boiling storm clouds, bloodthirsty fans, and players smashed into the mud. (Once again football, perhaps the most sophisticated of team sports, is viewed cinematically as a bunch of guys hitting each other in slow motion.) Unfortunately, all the self-conscious mythologizing and pumped-up macho posturing that Stone can muster doesn't conceal a clich&eacute;d, slapped-together script, whose few good ideas (mostly about race in America) jostle about with several hoary, terrible ones--including a too-literal analogy of football players as modern gladiators. (To drive the point home, Stone includes Charlton Heston--the agingBen-Hur--in one of many star-powered cameos.) All in all,Any Given Sundayis never dull, but never very enjoyable, either.--Bruce Reid", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305428492", "B00005JNEW", "B002O3Z4XY", "B00AEFYR3C", "B00AEBB9UU", "B000056VP4", "B000J3OTT6", "B00E1HIXFW", "B00005JPBO", "B00AEFXJY0", "B00004W221", "B00AEFXOKO", "B000KHYN9C", "B000EXZFCQ", "B002VWNIEA", "B000GAKDAG", "B00AEFYJI0", "B000FVR1T2", "B001LGXIA6", "630514415X", "B00005JLG1", "B000CBCWRG", "B0001Q4BOE", "B0001US66Y", "630529142X", "B0015OKWL2", "B00006RVJR", "B00003GPFT", "B0000JBUHI", "B002VECM6S", "078324021X", "6305505780", "B00009ZPUA", "B00004TJQJ", "0783226845", "B0000AC8LH", "B00BTYPWDQ", "B000C20VPA", "B00AEFYE08", "0767813901", "B000C20VRS", "B002CA68N4", "B00003CXNG", "B00005JLX2", "B00003W8NT", "B00275EGWY", "0792843592", "6305065551", "B000P0J09M", "B000MNOX94", "B00005N89M", "B00AEFYKWU", "B000P0J0AG", "B00005M20J", "6305428115", "B002NZK5VO", "B0000TG94W", "B003VA3JZY", "B00005JA9F", "B0034G4OSG", "B000CNESTE", "6305310335", "1558908390", "B000PAAJZ6", "B00000JGHV", "B0019L770A", "B004SIP7TE", "B0010YSD8Q", "B001GZ6QC4", "B000MGBSE4", "B00AEFY5B6", "6304765258", "B000F6ZIIS", "B001GKJ2E8", "B0000TWMWK", "B000JYW5BO", "B000BOH8X2", "B00005JKMQ", "B001DJLD1M", "B0041QSZS8", "B002AT8K9W", "B002O3Z50Q", "B009YQJ2Q4", "B000FOPPDI", "B001FB55NK", "B00004Z4WR", "B0045HCJG2", "B000M341QE", "B0029Z8K74", "B000A0GP0Y", "B000065U1N", "6301971345", "B0045HCIXG", "B00AEFXP8K", "B00005JN2Z", "B003PIUIIS", "155890834X", "B00066FAQW", "B000MXPE7O"], "bought_together": ["B00005JNEW", "B000056VP4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00B83N2NU", "B00000JXVK", "B00005JPBO", "B00005JNEW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 56346}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.98, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "0790749912", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5193WdbH-eL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Any Given Sunday"}

{"description": "Consciously crafted by director George Stevens as a piece of American mythmaking, Shane is on nearly everyone's shortlist of great movie Westerns. A buckskin knight, Shane (Alan Ladd) rides into the middle of a range war between farmers and cattlemen, quickly siding with the \"sod-busters.\" While helping a kindly farmer (Van Heflin), Shane falls platonically in love with the man's wife (Jean Arthur, in the last screen performance of a marvelous career). Though the showdowns are exciting, and the story simple but involving, what most people will remember about this movie is the friendship between the stoical Shane and the young son of the farmers. The kid is played by Brandon De Wilde, who gives one of the most amazing child performances in the movies; his parting scene with Shane is guaranteed to draw tears from even the most stonyhearted moviegoer. And speaking of stony hearts, Jack Palance made a sensational impression as the evil gunslinger sent to clean house--he has fewer lines of dialogue than he has lines in his magnificently craggy face, but he makes them count. The photography, highlighting the landscape near Jackson Hole, Wyoming, won an Oscar.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["630197705X", "0782008348", "0792106989", "630442972X", "B000056BRF", "630150528X", "B000O599ZS", "6300184951", "6304119038", "6305576173", "6301975987", "6300215962", "0792840836", "6303560040", "6300215741", "6304239149", "6302842263", "B000006N70", "6303854311", "1558802010", "0792838556", "6301325508", "6300215644", "B000M5BRX2", "6304457316", "6304196873", "0783221347", "630266232X", "6302909023", "0783215517", "0790733935", "0792841859", "6302640504", "6300183513", "6300216500", "6301969316", "0790743213", "6303072798", "6300215512", "0800100832", "0800104803", "6301798562", "0790743531", "6303562248", "0767825411", "0792107128", "6303039693", "6303402070", "0783235682", "079284517X", "6300269884", "6304457278", "6301798503", "6301976924", "6301670159", "B00000F13T", "6304071876", "B000M7BEPQ", "6301798759", "0783235593", "6300267938", "6300268748", "1555265952", "6300181340", "6304039530", "6301797957", "B00004RFFA", "6300214567", "6301599225", "6302529441", "B000021Y6K", "6304383169", "0792116887", "6302878535", "6301976622", "079284520X", "6304359705", "0792102320", "B00005R2E1", "6302484421", "1558807780", "6301586026", "0790733897", "6301965957", "0790752395", "6301670140", "6302715555", "0783216084", "6304359721", "6304111398", "6301706587", "6302278929", "6302130379", "6301969049", "6300183580", "6304508611", "B0002IXSVI", "6301971809", "0783235623"], "bought_together": ["630197705X"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 87936}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.99, "brand": "", "asin": "0792107683", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51NV73BNF7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Shane [VHS]"}
{"description": "Legendary silent film director Cecil B. DeMille didn't much alter the way he made movies after sound came in, and this 1956 biblical drama is proof of that. While graced with such 1950s niceties as VistaVision and Technicolor,The Ten Commandments(DeMille had already filmed an earlier version in 1923) has an anachronistic, impassioned style that finds lead actors Charlton Heston and Yul Brynner expressively posing while hundreds of extras writhe either in the presence of God's power or from orgiastic heat. DeMille, as always, plays both sides of the fence as far as sin goes, surrounding Heston's Moses with worshipful music and heavenly special effects while also making the sexy action around the cult of the Golden Calf look like fun. You have to seeThe Ten Commandmentsto understand its peculiar resonance as an old-new movie, complete with several still-impressive effects such as the parting of the Red Sea.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0002BO05S", "B0074JOUHE", "B0000633QW", "B001NSLE5I", "B00ALTQRUC", "B0006J28K0", "B00014K5V4", "B0007VY404", "B00D6I7DEE", "B00AMR5LZA", "B0006J28KA", "B003A6X166", "B0009WFF8Q", "B000CNE0JW", "B00005JN8Z", "B000056AXZ", "B0007VY3ZU", "B002Z2X7GU", "B00BQ7GU1Y", "B00005V1WY", "B001HFLU8I", "B00AMSM9CW", "B002T7X4UK", "B003A6WZXG", "B000056HP5", "B0009WFF9K", "B00009KYDL", "B000MGBM1I", "B00022LIHU", "B0074JOW5Y", "B000CNE0M4", "1450700551", "B002Z2X7GK", "B00005QJJG", "B002M2Z3BA", "B000RPCK2E", "B003NXH2TS", "B004RUF9DC", "B000BZISSU", "B0002UBX54", "B00028HBIO", "B00CNW9ZI6", "B00000JGOQ", "B006MWA96K", "B00BXHE208", "B0002J58JM", "B000JMKI10", "B0006GANX2", "B00125WAXM", "B002VWNIBI", "B000E1MXTG", "B00006ADD5", "B000CNESNA", "B00008LDO7", "B000WMFZMY", "B0001US8F8", "B001DZOCY6", "1450700543", "B00AEFY6DI", "B00HRYH6GI", "B000BVM1W8", "B0002UBX4U", "B000WS4S6C", "B000BDGVT0", "B002HK9IDQ", "B000BVM1VE", "B0001NBMDK", "B00KD5HFJG", "B00AEBB8VK", "B004L3ARS2", "B003I1DA6O", "B000N3T0GY", "B000HEWEJO", "1563713942", "B005CGI4O6", "1555681700", "B00006AG8D", "B001ECQ6E2", "B0090XLDKY", "B000EHSVS2", "B000BT970O", "B000URDCC6", "B0082SIPXQ", "B0047BXQZY", "B0001WTWS8"], "bought_together": ["B0074JOUHE", "B0002BO05S"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AMSM9CW", "B00AMR5LZA", "B000CNESNA", "B0002BO05S"]}, "price": 23.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 135826}, "asin": "0792154649", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51CW3ZCTDCL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Ten Commandments"}

{"description": "One of those movies that helped usher out the era of action films that had plots that made any sense (and also helped reverse the direction of Patrick Swayze's career arc),Road Houseconcerns a handsome, existential bouncer in a rinky-dink honky-tonk who owns both a degree in philosophy and a Mercedes. And that's perhaps the most believable aspect of the whole movie. Swayze stars as Dalton, \"the best bouncer in the business,\" who runs afoul of Wesley (Ben Gazzara), the meanest SOB round these parts, by taking up with his former girlfriend, Doc (Kelly Lynch)--the only woman in town with an IQ approaching double digits, even if she had unfathomably hooked up with such a lowlife. Swayze had complained about being typecast as beefcake when this was made, but that didn't stop him from revealing as much skin as possible--even guys like him, as revealed in a luridly seedy scene in which one of Wesley's goons tells Dalton that he reminds him of the kind of boyfriend he had in prison (albeit in much saltier terms).

{"description": "One of the most rousingly enjoyable sports movies ever made, this small-town drama tells the story of the Hickory Huskers, an underdog basketball team from a tiny Indiana high school that makes it all the way to the state championship tournament. It's a familiar story, but sensitive direction and a splendid screenplay helped make this one of the best films of 1986, highlighted by the superb performances of Gene Hackman as the Huskers' coach, and Oscar nominee Dennis Hopper as the alcoholic father of one of the team's key players. As the drama unfolds we come to realize that many of the characters (including Barbara Hershey as a schoolteacher with whom Hackman falls in love) are recovering from disappointing setbacks, and this depth of character is what makes the otherwise conventional basketball story so richly rewarding. LikeRocky,Rudy,andBreaking Away, this is a quintessentially American movie about beating the odds and rising above one's own limitations.

{"description": "Freddy Benson (Steve Martin) is a crass, loud American.  Laurence Jameson (Michael Caine) is a suave, urbane European. Their common ground is that they both are confidence men, and they meet in a train compartment as Benson is scamming his way across Europe, taking advantage of women's generosity. The two are forced into a rivalry, which culminates in a wager to see who can be the first to bilk $50,000 out of American heiress Janet Colgate (Glenne Headly). Their game of one-upmanship is, of course, brought to ridiculous heights as things progress. Written by Paul Henning (the mind behind such TV shows asGreen AcresandThe Beverly Hillbillies),Dirty Rotten Scoundrelsis an uneven but funny mix of Martin's physical comedy and Caine's oily charms. Martin's first role as cohort is to assume the persona of Ruprecht, the \"special\" younger brother intended to scare off potential brides. As Ruprecht, he comes off as a cross betweenThe Andy Griffith Show's Ernest T. Bass and Jerry Lewis; hilarious as it is, it doesn't quite fit with the rest of the film. Once the wager is on, though, Martin slips into his overly earnest mode as an American military man suffering from hysterical paralysis, with Caine as a psychologist who takes on his case. All in all,Dirty Rotten Scoundrels(a loose remake of the 1964 filmBedtime Storywith David Niven and Marlon Brando) is a droll, intelligent comedy, short on knee slappers but long on comic situations and characterizations.--Jerry Renshaw", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 434002}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.66, "brand": "", "asin": "0792842391", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/513ZVBB0X6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Dirty Rotten Scoundrels [VHS]"}
{"description": "Bee girls by nature, maybe, but not by cup size.Price Is  Rightmodel Anitra Ford anchors this enjoyably sleazy horror movie about  women who mate... and kill! Also, they get naked a lot. After a State  Department employee meets a mysterious motel death, agent Agar (Marlboro Man  William Smith) heads to Peckham, CA, to investigate. Soon, highly  unattractive middle-aged men are falling victim to beautiful young women as  quickly as they can drop trou. The women look completely normal except that  they all wear huge sunglasses even in the dark (hmmm...) and are frequently  naked. One could do a tidy thesis on how this 1973 marvel reflected male  fears of newly independent women--sexual and career independence seem to lead  directly to lesbianism and lethal coitus.

{"description": "If you think Jim Carrey's comedy is an acquired taste, think ofThe Cable Guyas a potent bottle of bittersweet wine. The film has a lingering aftertaste, but it is just a bit too dark, a bit too extreme to invite another serving. On the other hand, you've got to give Carrey some credit for risking his $20-million paycheck (and a big chunk of box-office revenue) on this black comedy. A needy, psychologically unbalanced cable-television installer (Carrey) forces his friendship upon an unsuspecting bachelor (Matthew Broderick) who has just broken up with his fianc&eacute;e. The movie gets edgier and more desperate--and in some respects funnier--as Carrey's cable guy gradually goes crazy. Director Ben Stiller manages to pack some pointed social commentary into the movie's many humorous detours.

{"description": "Bill Murray does warmth in his most consistently effective post-Stripescomedy, a romantic fantasy about a wacky weatherman forced to relive one strange day over and over again, until he gets it right. Snowed in during a road-trip expedition to watch the famous groundhog encounter his shadow, Murray falls into a time warp that is never explained but pays off so richly that it doesn't need to be. The elaborate loop-the-loop plot structure cooked up by screenwriter Danny Rubin is crystal-clear every step of the way, but it's Murray's world-class reactive timing that makes the jokes explode, and we end up looking forward to each new variation. He squeezes all the available juice out of every scene.

FBI agent Zack Grant (Crowe) sends beautiful rookie operative Seiko (Kelly Hu) on a sting operation against the depraved, skinhead son of a Mafia kingpin. Little does he know that Seiko is on a revenge mission of her own. This bloody situation escalates into all-out war, as the Mafia kingpin, Frank Serlano (Michael Lerner), and the head Yakuza, Yuji (Etsushi Toyokawa), get into the act. Grant is forced to go renegade from the bureau when Serlano kidnaps his young son, a plot point that certainly raises the story's emotional stakes.

Crowe is convincing inDirty Harrymode, bringing his characteristic intensity and empathy to the role.

And many of those who have seen it may have forgotten how flat-out thrilling it is. For all its great dramatic and cinematic qualities, and its fiery social criticism, Elia Kazan'sOn the Waterfrontis also one of the most gripping melodramas of political corruption and individual heroism ever made in the United States, a five-star gut-grabber. Shot on location around the docks of Hoboken, New Jersey, in the mid-1950s, it tells the fact-based story of a longshoreman (Brando's Terry Malloy) who is blackballed and savagely beaten for informing against the mobsters who have taken over his union and sold it out to the bosses. (Karl Malden has a more conventional stalwart-hero role, as an idealistic priest who nurtures Terry's pangs of conscience.) Lee J. Cobb, who created the role of Willy Loman inDeath of Salesmanunder Kazan's direction on Broadway, makes a formidable foe as a greedy union leader.--David Chute", "related": {"also_bought": ["1558807780", "6304039506", "6302824605", "B001KXZGO6", "6300214044", "0792837096", "6300215644", "6301586042", "0790733935", "0800100832", "6301976983", "0790743213", "0790734079", "0790743531", "6304119046", "B00AEFXN9G", "0782008348", "1569942072", "6302226899", "B00000J2KZ", "630442972X", "B00000FZCU", "6301773586", "B000BWIZRW", "6302360978", "B000006N70", "0792837967", "B000007PI4", "630018627X", "6301628616", "6302158176", "630021639X", "6301968948", "0780018664", "079284517X", "6301969405", "B001BZQMFA", "6302120624", "6304457316", "6304196873", "0792107683", "6303039405", "0783204914", "B003MG6FJY", "6301969294", "0792837630", "B00000GJ2B", "6300214567", "0790743159", "6300181278", "6302797535", "6301797957", "6300268470", "6301025083", "B000054OW2", "0783235607", "6301978692", "6302640504", "6301670140", "B000F3FTIA", "0792841026", "0792841859", "0792838556", "6304212151", "630347327X", "1558808590", "B000056BRF", "630196912X", "0800116917", "6300215938", "B0001E7LQG", "6302305950"], "bought_together": ["6304039506"], "also_viewed": ["0800116917", "6301797906", "6301976983", "6305123616", "0783216084", "6304429274", "1558807780", "0792839846", "0792837096"]}, "price": 25.97, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 530428}, "asin": "080018520X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZRDG09WEL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "On the Waterfront (includes Oscar's Greatest Moments 1971-1991) [VHS]"}
{"description": "A slapstick comedy starring Chris Farley,Beverly Hills Ninjais part prop-gag movie and part testament to the late comedian's physical comedic abilities. As a baby, Haru (Farley) appeared on the coastal shores of Japan. Legend has it that a foreigner would arrive and become the greatest ninja ever, known as the \"Great White Ninja.\" As Haru grew, it became apparent: he was not the one. But when a beautiful stranger named Sally (Nicollette Sheridan) appears at the dojo seeking a ninja's help, Haru finds his calling. Through a series of mix-ups (generally caused by Haru himself), Haru is framed for murder and he follows Sally to Beverly Hills to set things right. Finding out Sally's boyfriend is a counterfeiter and murderer, Haru with the help of hotel bellboy Joey (Chris Rock) and unknowingly with the help of his ninja brother Gobei (Robin Shou) takes down the counterfeit ring and finds his place among the ninja clan.Beverly Hills Ninjais full of individual comic gags that are hilarious in their purity--call it sadistic, but sometimes it's just plain funny watching a guy unwittingly walk into a lamppost while carrying on a conversation. Farley was a master at these tried-and-true gags, which reach right back into the origins of comedy. But it's not all slapstick; a scene where Haru is so taken by dancers at a local strip bar that he joins in is reminiscent of the mud-wrestling scene fromStripes.Beverly Hills Ninjamay be considered a low-brow romp, but a romp it is nonetheless.--Shannon Gee", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 424228}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.95, "brand": "", "asin": "0800187865", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51A3KEXJF3L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Beverly Hills Ninja [VHS]"}
{"description": "Thirteen-year-old Jenna (Shana Dowdeswell) has had enough with the trials of adolescence. In addition to being saddled with a devoted-but-nerdy best friend, Matt (Sean Marquette), she falls victim to one of the dangers of playing Seven Minutes in Heaven with the coolest kids in school: being stranded without a willing make-out partner. Humiliated, Jenna buries herself in the aforementioned make-out closet, wishing she could skip the whole adolescence bit and move straight into adulthood, and miraculously wakes up just weeks away from her 30th birthday. Of course, a lot has changed since going to bed the night before, not the least of which being an impressive set of womanly curves. The new, older Jenna (Jennifer Garner) is a successful magazine editor with friends in high places and a lion's share of potential suitors -- including a hockey-playing boyfriend and a swarthy married man. The problem is that her mind hasn't matured with her body; Jenna not only finds living on her own more terrifying than cool, but is quick to dismiss any male over the age of 14 as \"gross.\" Half excited, half mortified, Jenna seeks out Matt (Mark Ruffalo), whom she learns she had spurned as a teenager in an effort to join the popular crowd.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00006ZXSL", "B00AKGG6JS", "B00005O5CM", "B00AEFXO8Q", "B0015I2RT8", "B001OQCUYI", "B00005JMCW", "B001OQCUZM", "B00003CXSM", "B000J103OI", "B00AEFYM2S", "B002K0WBXW", "B00AEBB8R4", "B000EMGICS", "B004SIP9X8", "B003LSFM6U", "B0000897EG", "B000ELJAEM", "B00AEFY99O", "1401324142", "6304765266", "1416205152", "B00GO37I8Y", "0809229374", "B0001XAR1I", "B0001Z3TXE", "B00005JM55", "B00AEFYWQY", "B00007E2F5", "B0002VYOVI", "B00KS9V6EC", "B000J4QW7W", "B000YDBPAM", "B0007PLLBU", "B001TUZD8O", "B002ZG988M", "B0009OL7Z4", "B004SIP9RO", "B0000ZMGWK", "1400050138", "B0000DZ6N3", "B00AQS803A", "6302077818", "B00006ZXSK", "B00005JN0Z", "B000YAA68C", "B0007LXPBI", "B00E4Z7FQY", "B002P413IC", "B001ASQ9OM", "B006YTGL86", "B00795C5X4", "B00063KGPU", "B000BVM1S2", "B000209KMW", "B000A343RI", "B00062IVN0", "B000P0J0DS", "B00002SSKI", "6305428425", "B003TY2SWC", "B0051GLDVS", "B00008K7AM", "B0071HPOGK", "B0000AKCJK", "B000023VTP", "B00AEBB8YW", "B00006FMUW", "B002XTXG8O", "B00AMEZDJW", "B001AEF6BS", "B00447L4KA", "B000MQC9H4", "6305428042", "B002GOAH1U", "B0036TGSIK", "B002A5EBMQ", "B0000AOV4I", "B001C5LLQ4", "B000324Y98", "B00005JG6N", "6305236569", "B00AEFZ6V4", "B004EPZ070", "B003L20ICE", "B0038N9X3Q", "B00AEBBA2M", "B00005JN3W", "B0075RREYG", "B000F2BNW2", "0783235070", "B0021L8UO4", "0800177258", "B002SYAGNC", "B000HT386M", "B0007P0Y7C", "B000QUU4LY", "B00006ZXSN", "B00AEBB9WI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0013D8LFY", "B002K0WBXW", "B00AKGG6JS", "B001OQCUZM"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 461629}, "asin": "1404918051", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41EO6%2BQ3jvL.jpg", "title": "13 Going on 30: Fun &amp; Flirty Edition"}

{"description": "Before coming to America to make such acclaimed films asTender MerciesandDriving Miss Daisy, Australian director Bruce Beresford made a lasting impression with this compelling courtroom drama, considered one the finest films of the Australian new wave of the late 1970s and early 1980s. Based on a true story about three soldiers in the Boer War who are served up as political scapegoats of the British Empire, the film uses a flashback structure to dramatize the courtroom testimony.  It begins when the three Australian soldiers are railroaded for the justified killing of a German missionary and placed on trial for court-martial not as a matter of justice, but to mollify the German government for the sake of political expediency. Burdened with a competent but inexperienced and hopelessly disadvantaged lawyer, the soldiers realize that their fate has been sealed and the outcome of their trial is a fait accompli. Unfolding with urgent precision and a riveting focus on its well-drawn characters,Breaker Morantwas the all-time box-office hit in Australia at the time of its release in 1980, and it remains one of the very best historical dramas ever made.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00BTYJYR6", "B000CJ2E5I", "B00008PC13", "1593860161", "B0045HCIZE", "B0009UVCR6", "B000EOTUSA", "B000062XF0", "B00004TJKI", "B0002CR04A", "B0000639EU", "B001CTBGNS", "0792841409", "B00108FMFO", "B000KGGJ0Y", "B00005U8F4", "B0000EYUCK", "B0011FDVGI", "B000MV90B2", "B00006JU7U", "B000UJ48SQ", "B000EHSVQO", "0767802470", "B00049QQJQ", "B00004XPPC", "B00A29HFMU", "B0000B1A58", "B000E1E2N6", "B000LPR6GA", "B00006ADD5", "0330445936", "B00IBKXSKA", "B000YENUOK", "B00K6D1QV8", "630542828X", "B00005PJ6V", "0780021134", "B001LMAK6A", "B000AQ6A0I", "B000055Y0X", "B000HWZ4C0", "B000M2E30O", "B003XTOBU0", "B00AEFZDNA", "B000GG4Y32", "B004NTC7EQ", "B00DL48BM6", "B00007G1WH", "B00008UALL", "B00005JLD4", "B005DKS1TE", "B009XTF8NI", "B000V7HFL4", "B000CCUFB0", "B000O05DSK", "B0087ZG7OI", "B003B3NV6I", "B0008GGN9I", "B00D6I7ITY", "B004HHX9XC", "B00008AOTN", "B00096S4DA", "B0046YK4KW", "B004AKNRRY", "B006FE83UE", "B00C2535TE", "B00003CXBU", "B004ALIG0G", "B00004W229", "B00824FK9W", "B0024FADBU", "B002UXYCYK", "B0000A0DTC", "B0008ENHTO", "B00005NKTH", "B005T0OY5S"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00BTYJYR6", "B00008PC13", "B0000EYUCK", "B000CJ2E5I"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 104079}, "asin": "1572521775", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51%2BX9BSQzuL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Breaker Morant"}
{"description": "Outside of devoted cult audiences, many Americans have yet to discover the extremely stylish, relentlessly terrifying Italian horror genre, or the films of its talented virtuoso, Dario Argento.Suspiria, part one of a still-uncompleted trilogy (the luminously emptyInfernowas the second), is considered his masterpiece by Argento devotees but also doubles as a perfect starting point for those unfamiliar with the director or his genre. The convoluted plot follows an American dancer (Jessica Harper) from her arrival at a European ballet school to her discovery that it's actually a witches coven; but, really, don't worry about that too much. Argento makes narrative subservient to technique, preferring instead to assault the senses and nervous system with mood, atmosphere, illusory gore, garish set production, a menacing camera, and perhaps the creepiest score ever created for a movie. It's essentially a series of effectively unsettling set pieces--a raging storm that Harper should have taken for an omen, and a blind man attacked by his own dog are just two examples--strung together on a skeleton structure.

{"description": "Simultaneously elegiac and raw, this uneven--but unforgettable--tearjerker tells the story of Ingemar, a 12-year-old working-class Swedish boy sent to live with his childless aunt and uncle in a country village when his mother falls ill.  Beginning with several representations of the most savage, unsentimental domestic intensity imaginable (interplay between a sick parent and loving child has never looked anywhere near as explosive),My Life as a Dogwisely doesn't attempt to maintain that level of danger; rather, the change in locale to rural Sweden is accompanied by a slackening of pace and a whimsical breeziness.  Nevertheless, the tragic condition of Ingemar's mother (and later, the indeterminate fate of Sickan, his beloved dog, consigned to a kennel) hovers over the narrative with a gripping portentousness.  At times, director Lasse Hallstr&ouml;m misplaces the rhythm, and the film threatens to degenerate into a series of rustic vignettes; luckily, Ingemar's relationship with Gunnar, the jocular yet somewhat sinister uncle who essentially adopts him, carries a fascinating charge.  In Swedish, with subtitles.  This was later rewritten, whether intentionally or not, by Spike Lee, who changed the gender of the child, set the story in New York City, added a 1970s soul soundtrack, and called itCrooklyn.--Miles Bethany", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 548529}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 20.0, "brand": "", "asin": "1572523581", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515G8EVDVJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "My Life as a Dog [VHS]"}
{"description": "Made for a fraction of the cost of Oliver Stone's similarly themedNatural Born Killers, Gregg Araki'sThe Doom Generationis more persuasively outragous in its cultural satire, scarier in its violence, and more profound in its vision of a hate-fueled, media-drunk America seemingly determined to eat its young and dwell stupidly on their vengeance. Rose McGowan (Scream), James Duval (Nowhere), and Johnathon Schaech (That Thing You Do!) star as a trio of friends (Schaech's character actually being a complete stranger who steps into their car and into their lives one club-hopping night) who end up on a sex-and-crime spree that draws the fixed stare of television coverage. Araki makes a case for their continuing innocence in a society whose anti-outsider malevolence is barely disguised in the media but is quite naked out in the heartland, where a punishing level of bigotry is not unknown. Araki's jokes and techniques are crude yet forceful, and his anger is absolutely clear where Stone's was obscured and overreaching. The climax is among the most shattering and enraged scenes of '90s cinema. The DVD includes cast information, a theatrical trailer, and French and Spanish subtitles.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000JGWD5K", "B004OBQDCK", "B000F6II1M", "B00134SU2C", "B00008HCC9", "B004V8W4YM", "076784257X", "B00441GYVK", "B000WCN8QE", "B0007N19ZK", "B000FVQM2Y", "B00K0MM4AM", "B00JVQ7QTM", "B006M3M5FM", "B00005JM23", "0767835093", "B000092T6I", "B00JJ3EHCG", "B0000CABGW", "B008FL8OU4", "B00009W0U4", "B00EMAGKNU", "B00009KOY5", "B00CG4XKSM", "B000HT38EO", "B000002MAG", "B00000IBL1", "B001152TL6", "B00000JQVY", "B00E8G5H8W", "0780625528", "B000UAE7O0", "B00005ASPE", "B00ET2ODTE", "0780620321", "B00375LBKI", "B00004YA1E", "B00005T30L", "B005XGJW50", "B004SUDQC2", "B0057ZAA6W", "B002L1YGRY", "B001FOK70S", "B000TLTCQI", "B00I2U91Z0", "B006Z7Z3VS", "B001AZKB8K", "B00GRZPRB4", "B0048LPRCS", "B004SIP86Q", "B000056BP1", "B003WM5WLA", "B00062IESC", "B00005U14H", "B001FRNB9E", "B006UKX6GO", "B00005JMIJ", "B005Y1B3EW", "B0002RQ3M0", "B00D3DJIG8", "B00002CGG2", "B0050ODZ6M", "B00005JKJG", "B00C8CQ5SO", "B000053VAX", "B00GHP8SH4", "B004HY3BUQ", "B004P7CMHI", "B002AF4Y9G", "6305127654", "B00005K9O8", "B00023P4I8", "B000092T3X", "B001URA5Y8", "B0047T74CM", "6305594333", "B000059HA5", "B00AWQEK26", "B000JBXXYK", "0767837398", "B000QGDXG6", "B00005O5B3", "B00B022GVS", "B00HZ6ULZ6", "B0053TWVQ4", "B00004STVN", "B0002CR03G", "B006GL8NQ0", "B000A6T1ZY", "B0042FUHUM", "B00IF15GLE", "B001CC7PRQ", "B00CBFB8SU", "0783228457", "B000UDGOC0", "B0002JZT5A", "B005Z9MGRG", "B00009MEC4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00441GYVK", "B000F6II1M", "B004V8W4YM", "B000WCN8QE"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 123045}, "asin": "1573624039", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RBNDNZ3ZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Doom Generation"}
{"description": "Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones star as Gus McCrae and Woodrow Call, aging cowboys and former Texas rangers and who organize a 2,500 mile cattle drive for one last great adventure in this excellent 1989 miniseries adaptation of Larry McMurtry's novel. The best friends, who steal the herd from a gang of Mexican cattle rustlers, drive their herd from Texas to Montana, battling horse thieves, angry Indian tribes, and a renegade half-breed killer named Blue Duck (Frederic Forrest) on a mission of revenge. The excellent cast also includes Robert Urich as cardsharp and former Ranger Jake Spoon, Anjelica Huston as McCrae's old flame Clara Allen, Danny Glover, Ricky Schroder, Diane Lane, Chris Cooper, D.B. Sweeney, Steve Buscemi, and even a small role for author Larry McMurtry. Australian director Simon Wincer shows a tremendous capacity for balancing sweeping drama and intimacy against the gorgeous landscape of the American Southwest, giving a grandly epic feel to the film despite its small-screen target and limited budget, and for forging memorable characters of even the smallest supporting parts. The heart of the drama belongs to McCrae and Call, memorably etched by Duvall and Jones as the last of the range romantics. In the age of revisionist Westerns, this excellent cattle-drive drama nicely maintains an old-fashioned feeling while still showing the dark side of the American West.

When she uncovers one too many secrets lying in the catacombs of the university basement, she realizes that she may be the next victim.

{"description": "Clint Eastwood (making his very assured directorial debut) is a poetry-spouting stud-muffin DJ stalked by a maniacally amorous fan after a misguided one-night stand in this enjoyably schlocky, undeniably effective film about good intentions gone murderously wacky. Although many of thevery'70s trappings presented here may ultimately be too dated to be taken seriously (including a very self-indulgent jazz number and a hilariously gooey seduction number between Eastwood and Donna Mills), the core premise of infatuation taken out of bounds remains uncomfortably plausible--and was influential enough to be appropriated by one of the biggest hits of the '80s.

{"description": "Like the Greenwich Village courtyard view from its titular portal, Alfred Hitchcock's classicRear Windowis both confined and multileveled: both its story and visual perspective are dictated by its protagonist's imprisonment in his apartment, convalescing in a wheelchair, from which both he and the audience observe the lives of his neighbors. Cheerful voyeurism, as well as the behavior glimpsed among the various tenants, affords a droll comic atmosphere that gradually darkens when he sees clues to what may be a murder.Photographer L.B. \"Jeff\" Jeffries (James Stewart) is, in fact, a voyeur by trade, a professional photographer sidelined by an accident while on assignment. His immersion in the human drama (and comedy) visible from his window is a by-product of boredom, underlined by the disapproval of his girlfriend, Lisa (Grace Kelly), and a wisecracking visiting nurse (Thelma Ritter). Yet when the invalid wife of Lars Thorwald (Raymond Burr) disappears, Jeff enlists the two women to help him to determine whether she's really left town, as Thorwald insists, or been murdered.Hitchcock scholar Donald Spoto convincingly argues that the crime at the center of this mystery is the MacGuffin--a mere pretext--in a film that's more interested in the implications of Jeff's sentinel perspective. We actually learn more about the lives of the other neighbors (given generic names by Jeff, even as he's drawn into their lives) he, and we, watch undetected than we do the putative murderer and his victim. Jeff's evident fear of intimacy and commitment with the elegant, adoring Lisa provides the other vital thread to the script, one woven not only into the couple's own relationship, but reflected and even commented upon through the various neighbors' lives.At minimum, Hitchcock's skill at making us accomplices to Jeff's spying, coupled with an ingenious escalation of suspense as the teasingly vague evidence coalesces into ominous proof, deliver a superb thriller spiked with droll humor, right up to its nail-biting, nightmarish climax. At deeper levels, however,Rear Windowplumbs issues of moral responsibility and emotional honesty, while offering further proof (were any needed) of the director's brilliance as a visual storyteller.--Sam Sutherland", "related": {"also_bought": ["0790743213", "0783221347", "6304039530", "6300181340", "0783235593", "6300183580", "6300215741", "6301798503", "0783235607", "6305123616", "0792839846", "0783222955", "B0002IXSVI", "630150528X", "6301647734", "6304429274", "B0000040EO", "6302797667", "1558807780", "0783235704", "0792837614", "0783236352", "0783235623", "6301734734", "0790743159", "6305576173", "6304359705", "0783235682", "B00005A06N", "6304119097", "630266232X", "6301964012", "6300181529", "630233683X", "6301670159", "B00000F13T", "6301977084", "6301976061", "0792837649", "6303494390", "0782008348", "6300215512", "6305282927", "B00001OWYM", "B00005N5S2", "6303215734", "6300215717", "B000005PPB", "0783235674", "6305012792", "6304196954", "0800132009", "6302241103", "0792841859", "6304071876", "6302909023", "B00AEFXD1O", "B00000F3QZ", "6301607929", "6301978110", "B0087ZG7PW", "6300267865", "0800113055", "B000006N70", "B0045HCJ9E", "0782006809", "B00007JME0", "0780614097", "6301670140", "0792110269", "B000021Y6M", "6300269477", "0783235615", "6302413435", "6301798740", "0792837096", "6303854311", "B00005Q4GY", "0792107683", "0792837630", "6302800897", "6304457316", "0792835573", "6301978552", "B00000JKNL", "6303637574", "6305222754", "6302360978", "B00000JZIH", "6301797957", "6301975987", "1558800034", "6304359675", "6300271781", "630197350X", "6303364772", "6300216365", "6301800974", "0783227264"], "bought_together": ["0783221347", "6300183580"], "also_viewed": ["B0087ZG7PW", "B0045HCJ9E", "B0002HOEQ2", "B002GSXKQA", "B000A1INJE", "B000055Y0X", "B0087ZG7UW", "B001D8W7EU", "B00KMAVPW0", "B00J2R3VZI", "B008D1Q1VU", "B0045HCJHG", "B006FE83UE", "B00AEBB89C", "B003LMPKSQ", "B0045HCJQW", "B007N5YJWK", "0792839846", "B0002HOERG", "0790743213", "B000CCW2TS", "B000LP6KNU", "B000ECX0S8", "6304119046", "B00004XPPC", "B0010YSD7W", "B00AEBB97S", "B001D8W7EK", "B000ECX0O2", "6304429274", "B00I3C1T34", "6304039530", "630266232X", "0800132009", "6304039522", "B003VS0CX8", "0783235593", "B002VWNIAY", "6300183211", "B00BWJQEC6", "B0087F7VSY", "B002VWNIDG", "B00CNW9ZI6"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 203666}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.18, "brand": "", "asin": "6300183513", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518BC0WC70L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Rear Window [VHS]"}
{"description": "\"Return of the Archons\" is a cautionary story about mind control written by Gene Roddenberry. The tale begins when Ensign Sulu (George Takei) is taken hostage on an Earth-like planet with a primitive culture. Zapped by a weapon that leaves him under the control of someone or something named Landru, Sulu is then pursued by Kirk and Spock (Leonard Nimoy), who discover that Landru has the same grip on everyone else. Once Landru becomes aware of efforts by the captain and first officer to interfere with its bidding, Kirk and Spock become the target of a massive hunt by locals. A minor episode with a somewhat obvious scenario, \"Return of the Archons\" does have novel appeal in its heightened role for the ever-charming Sulu, and in Roddenberry's characteristically humane interest in elements that make people (and intelligent aliens) everywhere free to fulfill their destinies. The solution to the who-is-Landru mystery won't surprise anyone, but it may strike you as a prototype of several future episodes, from all theTrekseries, involving centralized caretaking on various planets.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300213412", "6300213315", "6300213358", "6300213307", "6300213528"], "bought_together": ["6300213358"], "also_viewed": ["6300213234"]}, "price": 7.78, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 504351}, "asin": "6300213269", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51MCY3BXCJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Star Trek - The Original Series, Episode 22: The Return Of The Archons [VHS]"}
{"description": "You could only see his eyes behind the layers of makeup, but those expressive orbs earned John Hurt a well-deserved Oscar nomination for his moving portrayal of John Merrick, the grotesquely deformed Victorian-era man better known as The Elephant Man. Inarticulate and abused, Merrick is the virtual slave of a carnival barker (Freddie Jones) until dedicated London doctor Frederick Treves (Anthony Hopkins in a powerfully understated performance) rescues him from the life and offers him an existence with dignity. Anne Bancroft costars as the actress whose visit to Merrick makes him a social curiosity, with John Gielgud and Wendy Hiller as dubious hospital staffers won over by Merrick. David Lynch earned his only Oscar nominations as director and cowriter of this somber drama, which he shot in a rich black-and-white palette, a sometimes stark, sometimes dreamy visual style that at times recalls the offbeat expressionism of his first film,Eraserhead. It remains a perfect marriage between traditional Hollywood historical drama and Lynch's unique cinematic eye, a compassionate human tale delivered in a gothic vein.

{"description": "An expensive box-office flop when released in 1970,The Molly Maguirescan now be appreciated as a compelling drama with potent political undertones. The talent involved is first-rate all the way: In addition to the volatile teaming of Sean Connery and Richard Harris on opposite sides of a Pennsylvania miners' war, director Martin Ritt and screenwriter Walter Bernstein were at the height of their Hollywood powers, determined to give viewers a visceral, grittily authentic drama about the exploitation of Irish immigrant miners in the centennial America of 1876. Connery's secret gang, the Molly Maguires, retaliates by destroying mines and equipment; Harris infiltrates the group as an informer hired by the coal-company owners, leading to his inevitable crisis of conscience. Pub brawls and manly action give the film its meat-and-potatoes appeal, and discerning viewers will appreciate the story's careful pacing and moral ambiguity; ironically, those qualities were blamed for the film's commercial failure.--Jeff Shannon", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 295654}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.98, "brand": "", "asin": "6300216144", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51VMKNEPBYL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Molly Maguires [VHS]"}

In Arthur Penn's adaptation of Thomas Berger's novel, Dustin Hoffman plays Jack from teen years into old age in a bravura performance. And Jack's story is a fantastic one: captured by Indians as a boy, reared as an Indian, shuttling back and forth between the white and Indian worlds. In the process, he befriends everyone from Wild Bill Hickock to George Armstrong Custer and is a gunslinger, a snake-oil salesman, and an Army scout. This is a solid blend of comedy and tragedy, with a strong statement to make about America's treatment of Native Americans without sermonizing. A terrific cast includes Faye Dunaway, Martin Balsam, and Richard Mulligan.

Some notorious mistakes were made--in the final shot, the sun sets in the east!--and it's an awkward attempt to graft WWII heroics onto the Vietnam experience. But as the Duke's attempt to acknowledge the men who were fighting and dying overseas, it's a rousing film in which Wayne commands a regiment on a mission to kidnap a Viet Cong general.

{"description": "1900is one of Bernardo Bertolucci's adventures in epic filmmaking that never found the reception he had hoped for. Originally more than six hours long, it was chopped down to four hours for its U.S. release and as a result looked, well, choppy. Eventually, he restored it to five hours--but one wonders at all the effort on behalf of this alternately muddled and stunning story. The film, with a decidedly socialist agenda, examines two lives that begin the same year in rural Italy: the weak-willed son of the aristocracy (Robert De Niro) and the hardy, courageous son of peasants (Gerard Depardieu). They grow up as best friends on the same estate, until class differences pull them apart and then the era's fascist politics divide them for good. Despite strong performances by both leads, as well as Sterling Hayden, Donald Sutherland, Dominique Sanda, and Burt Lancaster, this one is strictly for Bertolucci's most avid fans.--Marshall Fine", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 446090}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 28.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6301015320", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/317FADHB9AL.gif", "title": "1900 [VHS]"}
{"description": "Douglas Sirk puts theoperaback intosoap operain this exquisitely baroque melodrama, the epitome of Technicolor gloss. Rock Hudson (as wonderfully wooden as ever) and Lauren Bacall play stalwart examples of altruism, clean living, and good old American ambition, but Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone steal the film as white trash millionaire siblings stewing in self-pity. The plot reads like an episode ofDallas: Texas oil-baron playboy Stack steals good girl Bacall from best friend Hudson while Stack's sister Malone puts her slinky moves on Hudson, the strapping poor boy made good. Toss in impotence, jealousy, alcoholic binges, emotional blackmail, and backstabbing nastiness, mix vigorously with high style and expressionist flourishes, and you've got the most potent melodrama cocktail of the 1950s. Stack twists his arch delivery into the practiced bravado of a boozing womanizer nursing an inferiority complex while Malone sashays and flirts her way through an Oscar-winning performance as a slutty, sassy good-time girl. It's so over the top that it might seem kitschy at first glance, but former theater director Sirk subtly shades his vision in the shadows of film noir and uses the portentous angles and gaudy color to create a vivid, vivacious world of glossy surfaces and social masks cracking under the pressure of responsibility and the pain of lost love.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783215096", "6300183890", "B006VRRGOO", "B000HA4WSO", "B0009ML2KQ", "B000ION7AI", "6304239149", "6301706587", "6303364772", "1572520922", "6301973410", "6301975987", "6301977084", "6300215741", "6300269795", "6301973313", "6302278929", "6302000661", "630197333X", "630150528X", "0800100832", "B000BWIZRW", "B002TOL49Q", "630310245X"], "bought_together": ["0783215096", "6300183890"], "also_viewed": ["B00514JKKG", "B001ILTUL0", "B000JJRBFY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 291274}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.59, "brand": "", "asin": "6301045750", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515JMNXTQML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Written on the Wind [VHS]"}

{"description": "This adaptation of the F. Scott Fitzgerald novel, scripted by Francis Ford Coppola, puts costume design and art direction above the intricacies of character. It's certainly a handsome try, and perhaps no movie could captureThe Great Gatsbyin its entirety. Robert Redford is an interesting casting choice as Gatsby, the millionaire isolated in his mansion, still dreaming of the woman he lost. And Sam Waterston is perfect as the narrator, Nick, who brings the dream girl Daisy Buchanan back to Gatsby. No, the problem seems to be that director Jack Clayton fell in love with the flapper dresses and the party scenes and the Jazz Age tunes, ending up with a Classics Illustrated version of a great book rather than a fresh, organic take on the text. While Redford grows more quietly intriguing in the film, Mia Farrow's pallid performance as Daisy leaves you wondering why Gatsby, or anyone else, should care so much about his grand passion. The effective supporting cast includes Bruce Dern as Daisy's husband, and Scott Wilson and Karen Black as the low-rent couple whose destinies cross the sun-drenched protagonists. (That's future star Patsy Kensit as Daisy's little daughter.)

{"description": "After a scalding first reel in big-city night streets, Nicholas Ray'sOn Dangerous Ground(RKO, 1951) forsakes familiar noir terrain for the countryside--the mountains and snowfields where city cop Robert Ryan seeks a psychotic killer. For both the actor and the director, Ryan's character is an exemplary creation: a man with personal demons whose overzealous pursuit of criminals has pushed him into sadism. His passage from urban darkness into the silent white mountain country becomes a redemptive journey, thanks largely to his interaction with a blind woman (Ida Lupino) in an isolated farmhouse whose younger brother may be the quarry he's after. Ray developed the screenplay with A.I. Bezzerides under the supervision of producer John Houseman (for whom Ray had made his feature debut,They Live by Night).

{"description": "In this 1982 courtroom drama written by David Mamet and directed by Sidney Lumet, Paul Newman found the perfect role for a transitional period of his stellar career. As alcoholic Boston lawyer Frank Galvin, Newman shook off his screen persona as a handsome, blue-eyed hunk to portray an aging, weary man whose best years are behind him, with a shot-glass future that looks very bleak indeed. But when Galvin is given a chance to redeem himself--by proving medical negligence in the case of a comatose woman--he makes one final effort to regain his self-respect and tarnished reputation. He's an underdog against formidable odds, facing a powerful, politically connected lawyer (James Mason, slick as ever) who will do anything to win his case, regardless of professional ethics. Further complicating matters is a woman (Charlotte Rampling) who only appears to be worthy of Galvin's trust and love, until Galvin's best friend and colleague (Jack Warden) proves otherwise. Excellent as both courtroom drama and riveting character study, the film crackles with Mamet's sharp dialogue; and Lumet's direction is a brilliant example of forceful restraint. The film gave Newman one of the best roles of his career; many felt he deserved the Oscar (he lost to Ben Kingsley inGandhi) that would belatedly be given to Newman forThe Color of Money. Along withHud,Cool Hand Luke, andButch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,The Verdictranks highly as a signature performance by one of America's all-time greatest actors.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00441GYOM", "6303451462", "0790741040", "0792841859", "B000006N70", "6302479487", "6300214567", "6302130379", "0782008348", "6303072798", "0783235593", "5559477621", "B00005QATY", "6300182479", "630146494X", "6304458975", "0800116917", "6302226899", "0790743213", "0800142039"], "bought_together": ["B00441GYOM"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 217321}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.9, "brand": "", "asin": "6301599896", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Q67JB37ML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Verdict [VHS]"}

{"description": "Sergei Eisenstein's revolutionary sophomore feature has so long stood as a textbook example of montage editing that many have forgotten what an invigoratingly cinematic experience he created. A 20th-anniversary tribute to the 1905 revolution, Eisenstein portrays the revolt in microcosm with a dramatization of the real-life mutiny aboard the battleshipPotemkin. The story tells a familiar party-line message of the oppressed working class (in this case the enlisted sailors) banding together to overthrow their oppressors (the ship's officers), led by proto-revolutionary Vakulinchuk. When he dies in the shipboard struggle the crew lays his body to rest on the pier, a moody, moving scene where the citizens of Odessa slowly emerge from the fog to pay their respects. As the crowd grows Eisenstein turns the tenor from mourning a fallen comrade to celebrating the collective achievement. The government responds by sending soldiers and ships to deal with the mutinous crew and the supportive townspeople, which climaxes in the justly famous (and often imitated and parodied) Odessa Steps massacre. Eisenstein edits carefully orchestrated motions within the frame to create broad swaths of movement, shots of varying length to build the rhythm, close-ups for perspective and shock effect, and symbolic imagery for commentary, all to create one of the most cinematically exciting sequences in film history. Eisenstein's film is Marxist propaganda to be sure, but the power of this masterpiece lies not in its preaching but its poetry.--Sean Axmaker", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 523393}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6301815807", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21JVPR6MGVL.jpg", "title": "Battleship Potemkin [VHS]"}

The film was nearly dumped by its studio because its pessimistic story seemed too downbeat.

In this case, it's greed: Cutter (John Heard), a burnt-out gigolo, and his pal Bone (Jeff Bridges), a disfigured Vietnam veteran, get involved in a plot involving corruption and murder. Bone has proof that a powerful businessman is behind the killing and wants to be paid off to keep quiet; instead he buys them more trouble than he can imagine.

{"description": "Ingmar Bergman's 1966 film, photographed by Sven Nykvist, begins when famous actress Elisabeth Vogler (Liv Ullmann) freezes on stage in the middle of a performance. Struck dumb by an unknown cause, she winds up in the care of young inexperienced nurse Alma (Bibi Andersson), and together they retreat to the seaside for the summer, where they enter into an uncommon intimacy and clash of wills. Bergman's study of the fragility of the human being and the treachery of life is incredibly moving in its perception and unrivaled imagery. And as always with Bergman and his reappearing ensemble of actors, the performances are flawless. Especially notable is the scene in which Alma recounts for the silent Elisabeth a morally and emotionally ambivalent erotic encounter she had experienced on a beach with a friend and two teenage boys. It is one of the most strangely erotic scenes ever filmed, and not a stitch of clothing is removed. Also of interest, and one of the most intriguing scenes in the film, perhaps among the most intriguing in all of cinema, is when Elisabeth paces barefooted back and forth over a patio on which we know there to be broken glass. It is an achievement in simple suspense from which many an aspiring director of thrillers could learn a bit. For those who've had their fill of predictable plots, irrelevant matter, and apish acting and are looking for something a little more sensual, poetic, and relevant to what life is about beyond the daily grind, this may be a good place to start.--James McGrath", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302783348", "6303107346", "6303107354", "6300208591", "630264187X", "6304209584", "6303107338", "6302783356", "6301224752", "630154028X", "B000007NTY", "6302641918", "0783221347", "B0000YEEH6", "6300147908", "6301564456", "6300184110"], "also_viewed": ["6303107338"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 651751}, "asin": "630204135X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21X1YQ2583L.jpg", "title": "Persona [VHS]"}
{"description": "The swashbuckler had been around long before Errol Flynn drew a cutlass, but the Tasmanian-born bit player reinvigorated the genre with his mix of dashing good looks, haughty insolence, and alluring confidence. Adapted from the novel by Rafael Sabatini (who also pennedThe Sea Hawk), this rousing adventure chronicles the travails of Peter Blood (Flynn), a righteous doctor unjustly sold into slavery for treating the wounds of rebels, a kind of British Dr. Mudd. Sent to a Jamaican plantation where he toils under the brutal whip of Lionel Atwill and seethes with passion for his fair niece (the astonishingly beautiful Olivia de Havilland), he escapes from bondage with his fellow prisoners and becomes the gentleman rogue pirate of the Caribbean. Director Michael Curtiz builds from one set piece to another, including a nimble beachside sword fight with pirate nemesis Basil Rathbone and climaxing with a grand sea battle that belies the film's modest budget. Flynn's bravado and charisma are apparent from his entrance, but once he leaps into action he takes command of the picture, overcoming his still-green dramatic skills with sheer personality.Captain Bloodmade stars of Flynn and de Havilland and catapulted Curtiz to the top ranks of Warner directors. The three reunited for some of the studio's best-loved adventures:The Charge of the Light Brigade,The Adventures of Robin Hood, andDodge City.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301977149", "B00005A1VG", "B0047BXQZY", "6302120101", "6303943004", "B000N3T0GO", "6302825024", "B001CBIYSG", "630150528X", "6300215512", "6302878535", "6301976932", "6300183084", "B00000493Q", "6301412702", "6302753198", "6300215830", "0792837630", "0783221347", "6301972341", "630266232X", "6301670140"], "also_viewed": ["B0047BXQZY", "B00005JKFR", "B00009NHC0", "B000N3T0GO", "6301977149", "B00008MTY1", "B00005JMR6", "B000A9QK8M", "B000M2E30E"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 304837}, "asin": "6302120527", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/216BMVZVR3L.jpg", "title": "Captain Blood [VHS]"}

{"description": "British thespian and sophomore director Kenneth Branagh follows up his adaptation of Shakespeare'sHenry Vwith this abrupt change of pace, a slick, stylish thriller evocative of Hitchcock, classic film noir, and gothic shockers. Sporting an exaggerated American accent, Branagh stars as L.A. private eye Mike Church, a hard-boiled but softhearted detective who takes on the case of a mysterious amnesiac (Branagh's then-real-life wife, Emma Thompson). With the help of an offbeat furniture dealer and part-time hypnotist (Derek Jacobi), Grace (as Mike has named her) dredges up her hidden memories. Little do they realize that her recollections are of a past life in L.A.'s recent history, and as she recounts the details of a famous marriage that ended with a notorious murder (played out as black-and-white flashbacks starring Branagh and Thompson), events of the present begin to mirror the past, as if fate were pulling the two into fatal replay of history. Branagh's flashy, flourished direction echoes with an array of '40s and '50s classics and near classics (most notably Hitchcock'sRebeccaandSpellbound) and drives the story with an edgy urgency, all the better to distract from some of the sillier elements of the plot. But while this film may not make literal sense in the harsh light of day, in the twilit, shadowy world of classic Hollywood this slyly inventive thriller is a bravura bit of old-fashioned entertainment, done up with modern flair.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302482712"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 336608}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.75, "brand": "", "asin": "6302289009", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51H8X0SC52L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Dead Again [VHS]"}

{"description": "The British superspy with a license to kill takes on his dark underworld double, a classy assassin who kills with golden bullets at $1 million a hit. Roger Moore, in his second outing as James Bond, meets Christopher Lee's Scaramanga, one of the most magnetic villains in the entire series, in this entertaining but rather wan entry in the 007 sweepstakes. Bond's globetrotting search takes him to Hong Kong, Bangkok, and finally China, where Scaramanga turns his island retreat into a twisted theme park for a deadly game of wits between the gunmen, moderated by Scaramanga's diminutive man Friday Nick Nack (Fantasy Island's Herv&eacute; Villechaize). Britt Ekland does her best as the most embarrassingly inept Bond girl in 007 history, a clumsy, dim agent named Mary Goodnight who looks fetching in a bikini, while Maud Adams is Scaramanga's tough but haunted lover and assistant (she returns to the series as the title character inOctopussy). Clifton James, the redneck sheriff fromLive and Let Die, makes an embarrassing and ill-advised appearance as a racist tourist who briefly teams up with 007 in what is otherwise the film's highlight, a high-energy chase through the crowded streets of Bangkok that climaxes with a breathtaking midair corkscrew jump. Bond and company are let down by a lazy script, but Moore balances the overplayed humor with a steely performance and Lee's charm and enthusiasm makes Scaramanga a cool, deadly, and thoroughly enchanting adversary.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302510023", "6302510031", "630251018X", "630251004X", "6302510007", "6302380596", "6304047843", "6302510198", "630238060X", "6302380294", "B0000068SI", "B00008V2VP", "6304032579", "6302380588", "B000006FNX", "B00004TYS8", "6303651461", "6303651488", "6305784906", "B00004RWUH", "6302824613", "6303212263", "630596260X"], "bought_together": ["6302510023", "6302510031"], "also_viewed": ["6302380588", "6302510031", "6302510007", "6302510023", "B00004TYS8", "6302380294", "6304047843", "630251018X", "630251004X", "6303651488", "630238060X", "6303651461", "6302380596", "6302510198", "B00008V2VP", "6304032579"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 170742}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.58, "brand": "", "asin": "6302510015", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510E8WWVDZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Man With the Golden Gun [VHS]"}

{"description": "In 1992, Woody Allen and Mia Farrow--heretofore the Lunt and Fontanne of Hollywood on the Hudson--went public with a media-saturated battle over Allen's affair with Farrow's adopted daughter. Only a few months later, Allen released this film, starring himself and Farrow acting out a virtually identical plot line: an unhappy marriage begins to crumble when the husband strays with a much younger woman (in this case, one of his students, played by Juliette Lewis). It turned out to be one of Allen's most lacerating comedies, a story about the fragility of relationships and the foolishness of older men seeking to recapture their youth with younger women. It features strong performances by Judy Davis, Liam Neeson, and director Sydney Pollack, as a friend of Allen's who chucks his longtime wife for an aerobics instructor, thus planting seeds of marital dissolution in all of his friends' heads.Husbands and Wivesprovided an uncanny peek into Allen's image of himself and his personal life, despite all of his protestations to the contrary.--Marshall Fine", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303011411", "6301971922", "6304039166", "6303430546", "B000NNOYH4"], "also_viewed": ["B00005AUJP", "B000BWMEIS"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 425809}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.03, "brand": "", "asin": "6302697042", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31J3XDF7AHL.gif", "title": "Husbands &amp; Wives [VHS]"}

{"description": "EDITOR'S NOTE: According to a Warner Home Video technician involved in  the production ofThe Stanley Kubrick Collection, Kubrick authorized all aspects of theCollection, from the use of Digital Component Video (or \"D-1\") masters originally approved in 1989, to the use of minimalist screen menus, chapter stops, and (in the case of2001: A Space OdysseyandThe Shiningon DVD) supplementary materials. Full-screen presentation ofThe ShiningandFull Metal Jacketwas also approved by Kubrick, who recomposed his original framing,  reportedly believing that those films looked best on video in the full-screen format. (In fact, the original theatrical aspect ratio ofThe Shiningwas 1.66:1, meaning that a relatively small portion of the image is lost.) Kubrick also chose mono over stereo,  believing that inconsistencies in theatrical sound systems resulted in loss of control over theatrical presentation. In every respect, the Warner spokesman  said, the films in theCollectionremain as Kubrick approved them. Any future attempt to remaster or alter them would  have to be approved by an appointee of the Kubrick estate.", "related": {"also_bought": ["0790705141", "0792839846", "6303402070", "0783221347", "0790731975", "0784011923", "6300182916", "6300216047", "0792842464", "6302360978", "6300185281", "6302054982", "6302120101", "B00005ATQA", "6305237115", "0790734079", "B001BZQMFA", "6300184110", "6300183416", "B00000J2L7", "B00000FZCU", "6300216500", "B000AMW2TK", "6301564456", "6300247171", "B00000JGEK", "630442972X", "B00005B238", "0790758474", "0790733927", "6303953425", "0783217528", "0792845684", "B00004W5UA", "0767825411", "6304429274", "6300183092", "6305363668", "0790734877", "B00000JRUB", "0783235607"], "bought_together": ["0790705141"], "also_viewed": ["B001993Y1S", "B008M4MB8K", "B00337QJO8", "B00GGAK0FS", "B00108E1GU", "B006JVPK2M", "6302610702", "B008MILL8C", "6300214826", "B001AQO3QA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 369746}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6302760046", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514N60SRJ4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]"}

{"description": "You may be surprised to discover that the director of theLethal Weaponmovies and scary horror flickThe Omen, Richard Donner, also produced and directed this classic children's adventure (which, by the way, was written by Donner's screen-wizard friend Steven Spielberg). Then again you may not.The Goonies, like Donner's other movies, is the same story of good versus evil. It has its share of bad guys (the Fratelli brothers and their villainous mother), reluctant-hero good guys (the Walsh bothers and their gang of friends), and lots of corny one-liners. Like in an old-fashioned Hardy Boys or Nancy Drew plot, the Goonies need to solve a problem: a corrupt corporate developer has bought out their neighborhood and plans to flatten all their homes. Luckily, the beloved gang stumbles on a treasure map. In the hopes of finding the treasure to buy back their houses, the Goonies embark on their quest through underground passages, aboard pirate ships, and behind waterfalls. This swashbuckling and rollicking ride was also a great breeding ground for a couple of child actors who went on to enjoy numerous successes in adulthood: Sean Astin (Rudy,Encino Man) and Martha Plimpton (Pecker,200 Cigarettes).--Samantha Allen Storey", "related": {"also_bought": ["0790700506", "6303506291", "6303212395", "6300263681", "0790742322", "0767825411", "6301871952", "B00005B238", "6301792734", "B00005PJ8I", "6303257844", "630157401X", "B00000JGEK", "6304143184", "6300214060", "6302945127", "6301179552", "B00004TWZK", "B00000JGEI", "6304718551", "0783216084", "B00000JPH5", "630339406X", "6301163796", "6302968143", "B00006AL1C", "6304466498", "0788802194", "0783229011", "6304978286", "6302798450", "B00016JF2W", "B002NZK5SW", "6302642256", "6300248089", "0800125762", "0790724960", "6304509154", "6301666569", "6302705517", "6301569385", "6301578805", "6300989003", "B00008DDXB", "6302815673", "B00000JPH4", "630596260X", "6302961661", "B000AQE9WY", "6303486754", "6301744136", "6305576173", "0800196767", "6300183467", "0800125789", "B0002TT0NM", "B0000048S1", "0790732580", "6303212263", "0784011923", "6300184269", "6300271285", "6304169558", "B00005LIRF", "6300214710", "B00004U8P4", "6300182878", "B0007A2GSM", "630309239X", "6302877881", "6304340648", "B00008X5J8", "0767821912", "6303140157", "6303442447", "6303454089", "6302409365", "B00003CXI0", "B000035Z46", "B00005JLR1", "6303929583"], "bought_together": ["0790700506", "0790742322"], "also_viewed": ["0790742322", "6303506291", "0767825411", "155890641X", "6303212395", "6302091632", "0790700506", "6300183211", "6302814782", "B00005LL26", "B00004TWZK", "B00028HBES", "6304718551", "0790731436", "B00000JKNP", "6300214710", "B000005PFL", "6300270033", "6305428050", "6303224407", "630339406X", "B000035Z2S", "6304117752", "B00003CXIP", "B00003CXQX", "6303148352", "0783216084", "B00005JNQS", "6305326940", "6300263673", "6301792734", "B00080ZFZC", "6304400551", "0790748266", "B00004TJTQ", "0790719029", "6304434340", "B00003CXI0", "6303241123", "6303314015", "B000067FP8", "B00005JKDQ", "B006VRRGNK", "B000C3L27U", "B00000JPH5", "6303953425", "6302765536", "B004Z7AHZC", "B009Z5975A", "B00081912E", "1560395737", "B00001IVED", "6304089767", "B003KV3E3G", "B0052OPJ1E", "B00447L4JG", "B0007KTBIU", "6302914469", "B001BA9FIG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 66611}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.93, "brand": "", "asin": "6303212379", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/512FAC93Y7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]"}

{"description": "Edward D. Wood Jr. was an actor writer-director-producer, occasionally in drag, who combined meager bursts of talent with an undying optimism to create some of the most bizarrely memorable \"B\" movies to ever come out of Tinseltown. Though Wood died in obscurity as an alcoholic in 1978, his films have been considered cult classics for years. He is consistently voted the worst director who ever lived. You would think this an odd subject, but director Tim Burton harnesses the undying hopefulness that made Wood such a character. Shot in black and white, just like Wood's creations, this stylized, witty production captures the poetic absurdity of Wood's films and his unconventional life. Burton's recreation of Wood's wonderfully awfulPlan 9 from Outer Spacelooks much better than the original low-budget quickie. Burton tackled an extremely strange subject matter for a biopic, but Wood is presented as naive almost to the point of delusion, so the story works. The pace sags in the middle, as the weirdness starts to wear thin, but Depp proves himself an adroit actor, even while wearing angora and a blonde wig. Wood's unconventional repertoire company is faithfully reproduced, including an Academy Award-winning Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi. Landau is pathetic, droll, and charismatic as the elderly junkie who made his last screen appearances in Wood's films.--Rochelle O'Gorman", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301763041", "0800187873"], "bought_together": ["6301763041"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 314635}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.87, "brand": "", "asin": "6303407188", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51F97RJE9XL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Ed Wood [VHS]"}

{"description": "An electronics industrialist plots to conquer the world using the cybernetic devices his company makes. You can insert your own Bill Gates joke  here, but in this epic eight-part 1968Doctor Whoadventure, the villain, Tobias Vaughn (Kevin Stoney in a great performance, one eyebrow perpetually cocked as he schemes), has allied himself with the robotic Cybermen and nearly succeeds in global domination. This story was a harbinger of what was to come in the series during the first half of the 1970s--that is, the threat to contemporary (or near-future) Earth, with the Doctor (Patrick Troughton) joining up with the quasi-military U.N.I.T. headed by Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart (Nicholas Courtney--who also provides a newly shot introduction to the story and fills in the two missing episodes that were shamelessly destroyed by the BBC when they purged their archives in the early 1970s). Director Douglas Camfield fully exploits the mood-inducing black-and-white imagery, manages to keep the action going (with assistance from real Department of Defence soldiers on loan), and provides some memorable moments, particularly the Cybermen bursting out of the sewers and marching relentlessly through the streets of London at the end of episode 6. The writers wisely give Vaughn most of the exposition with the Doctor and allow the Cybermen to remain nearly indestructible, mostly silent killers. This may not be the greatest of the Cybermen stories in the 1960s, but the metallic monsters make the most of their appearances here, thus cementing their reputation in popularity as second only to the Daleks.--Ryan K.

{"description": "There were only two ways for \"classicTrek\" cast members to appear in a movie with the cast ofStar Trek: The Next Generation: either Capt. Kirk and his contemporaries would have to be very, very old, or there would be some time travel involved in the plot. Since geriatric heroes aren't very exciting (despite a welcomed cameo appearance by the aged Dr. McCoy),Star Trek: Generationsunites Capt. Kirk (William Shatner) and Capt. Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) in a time-jumping race to stop a madman's quest for heavenly contentment. When a mysterious energy coil called the Nexus nearly destroys the newly christened U.S.S.Enterprise-B, the just-retired Capt. Kirk is lost and presumed dead. But he's actually been happily trapped in the timeless purgatory of the Nexus--an idyllic state of being described by the mystical Guinan (Whoopi Goldberg) as \"pure joy.\" Picard must convince Kirk to leave this artificial comfort zone and confront Dr. Soran (Malcolm McDowell), the madman who will threaten billions of lives to be reunited with the addictive pleasure of the Nexus. With subplots involving the android Data's unpredictable \"emotion chip\" and the spectacular crash-landing of the starshipEnterprise, this crossover movie not only satisfiedTrekfans, but it also gave them something they'd never had to confront before: the heroic and truly final death of a belovedStar Trekcharacter. Passing the torch to the Next Generation with dignity and entertaining adventure, the movie isn't going to please everyone with its somewhat hokey plot, but it still ranks as a worthy big-screen launch for Picard and his stalwart crew.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305587159", "6304415346", "B00008OSD3", "6303202004", "6300216802", "630273486X", "6301543408", "630021463X", "6300215830"], "bought_together": ["6305587159", "6304415346"], "also_viewed": ["6305587159", "6304415346", "B00008OSD3", "6300214400", "6301543408", "6300216802"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 333275}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 0.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6303909949", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516Y2CS1YML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Star Trek Generations [VHS]"}

{"description": "Legendary 1950s-60s B-Movie Horror Director Roger Corman filmed this 1959 Horror Classic with the tag-line \"A beautiful woman by day - a lusting Queen wasp by night\". The film is a real hoot, great camp-fun with actress Susan Cabot as the aging owner of a famous cosmetic firm, who turns to a crackpot scientist for everlasting beauty. A natural answer, don't we all turn a scientist when we see a wrinkle now & then. Well, of course this wasn't a good decision on her part, the scientist apparently got his degree from the \"Mad-Scientist School\". The enzymes from the Queen wasps that the scientist used at first gives her great beauty but soon the nature of the Queen wasp comes to the surface and she is totally distorted with a giant Wasp-head (not what the cover shows which was the movie poster). Desperately she realizes that the only way to keep her beauty is to protect her serum, she turns to violence and death at night as the wasp woman. Of course, this was supposed to be a serious horror film but if you don't out right laugh over the \"cheeseiness\" of this 50s film something is wrong. Yea, it's a Classic, it's so bad, it's actually good. Those who love to laugh at those Ed Wood films should check this one out.

In 1900,  Henri Fortin (Belmondo) is wrongfully imprisoned for murder; his loyal wife is  forced into menial labor and prostitution; then in the beginning of World War  II, Fortin's son (Belmondo again) helps a Jewish family elude the Nazis, setting  in motion his own imprisonment, escape, and adventures as a criminal. Not only  is that just the first half of the movie, there are also the story lines of the  husband, wife, and daughter of the Jewish family, who each have their own  struggles.

And why did Captain Cutshaw (Scott Wilson) go berserk just seconds before a scheduled rocket launch? These are just some of the puzzles that will eventually be solved inThe Ninth Configuration, a giddy and often brilliant drama created by William Peter Blatty, who wroteThe Exorcistbefore directing this adaptation of his own novel,Twinkle, Twinkle, Killer Kane. A satirical study of war's traumatic aftermath, the film uses battle psychosis as the springboard for a delirious and scathingly intelligent human tragedy, laced with some of the wittiest dialogue you're ever likely to hear.The movie boasts a veritable menagerie of crazy characters, all brought vividly to life by a stellar supporting cast. One patient is preparing a production of Shakespeare with an all-dog cast. Another is convinced he's Superman, and the resident doctor can't seem to find his trousers. But there's a method to this madness, and it takes a barroom brawl--one of the most memorable in movie history--to provide the harsh slap of reality to Blatty's elaborate group therapy scheme.

This time, we follow the fortunes of four people who lock themselves inside a shopping mall to get away from the marauding dead and who then immerse themselves in unabashed consumerism, taking what they want from an array of clothing and jewelry shops, making gourmet meals, etc. It is Romero's take on Louis XVI in the modern world: keep the starving masses at bay and crank up the insulated indulgence.

{"description": "They call itGiantbecause everything in this picture is big, from the generous running time (more than 200 minutes) to the sprawling ranch location (a horizon-to-horizon plain with a lonely, modest mansion dropped in the middle) to the high-powered stars. Stocky Rock Hudson stars as the confident, stubborn young ranch baron Bick Benedict, who woos and wins the hand of Southern belle Elizabeth Taylor, a seemingly demure young beauty who proves to be Hudson's match after she settles into the family homestead. For many the film is chiefly remembered for James Dean's final performance, as poor former ranch hand Jett Rink, who strikes oil and transforms himself into a flamboyant millionaire playboy. Director George Stevens won his second Oscar for this ambitious, grandly realized (if sometimes slow moving) epic of the changing socioeconomic (and physical) landscape of modern Texas, based on Edna Ferber's bestselling novel. The talented supporting cast includes Mercedes McCambridge as Bick's frustrated sister, put out by the new \"woman of the house\"; Chill Wills as the Benedicts' garrulous rancher neighbor; Carroll Baker and Dennis Hopper as the Benedicts' rebellious children; and Earl Holliman and Sal Mineo as dedicated ranch hands.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000059HH1", "6302797616", "6305123616", "1569942072", "B000005PPB", "6300182371", "6300215830", "B000006FKX", "6301045750", "B00068S41I", "0792107683", "6300183890", "B000A1KF8Q", "6301599225", "B000054OW2", "6300215644", "B00004TX2D", "6302655897", "0767825616", "6301976622", "0792839129", "B00005A1VH"], "bought_together": ["6302797616", "B000059HH1"], "also_viewed": ["B004XKVP7K", "B0007TKNK6", "B0000040EJ", "B0000068ZQ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 221648}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.98, "brand": "", "asin": "6304239149", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51MN3CNVQYL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Giant (Special Widescreen Edition) [VHS]"}

{"description": "This strange and charming documentary by Al Pacino, in which he also stars, is an exploration of several topics: Shakespeare and his hump-backed villain, the impulse to act, the way actors work--and Pacino's single-minded effort to make the Bard accessible to all audiences and not just the effete few. Over the course of the film, Pacino alternately discusses the role and the text; roams Manhattan, talking about Shakespeare with everyone from scholars to people on the street; and re-creates scenes from the play in a production staged at the Cloisters, an evocative castle-like museum on the north end of Manhattan. He assembles a cast that includes Kevin Spacey, Winona Ryder, Estelle Parsons, and Alec Baldwin to perform the scenes, and he slips back and forth between text and discussion of the play in a way that makes Shakespeare comprehensible and fascinating to viewers who know or care nothing about his writing.--Marshall Fine", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 263742}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "title": "Looking for Richard [VHS]", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00DQN6IOK", "B00B1E6EAY", "B00ECR7KX2", "B0002TVWYW", "B004M9ZI0M", "B00B2BYY1W", "6301863240", "6305622892", "6304046006"], "also_viewed": ["B000A9QK50"]}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51BNGXAGY7L._SY300_.jpg", "asin": "6304393075"}

{"description": "After years of enduring Roger Moore in the role of James Bond, it was good to have Sean Connery back in this 1983 film for a one-time-only trip down 007's memory lane. Connery's Bond, a bit of a dinosaur in the British secret service at (then) 52, is still in demand during times of crisis. Sadly, the film is not very good. In this rehash ofThunderball, Bond is pitted against a worthy underwater villain (Klaus Maria Brandauer); and while the requisite Bond Girls include beauties Kim Basinger and Barbara Carrera, they can't save the movie. The script has several truly dumb passages, among them a (gasp) video-game duel between 007 and his nemesis that now looks utterly anachronistic.

{"description": "The burning intensity of Russell Crowe (L.A. Confidential) first  lit up screens as a hate-filled,Mein Kampf-spouting skinhead in this brutal Australian drama. Crowe glowers from under his deep-set eyes as Hando, the creepy but charismatic leader of a racist gang who declares war on the Asian immigrants pouring into Melbourne. His rage erupts in violent attacks on the local Vietnamese community, but when his victims fight back his gang breaks up, and Hando flees the city with his best buddy Davey (Daniel Pollock) and redheaded hellion Gabe (Jacqueline McKenzie), a rich girl runaway who turns the dynamic duo into a splintered love triangle. Writer-director Geoffrey Wright's matter-of-fact treatment of this subculture eschews social commentary for visceral immediacy. His portrait of white supremacist punks living like squatters on the fringes of Australian society is powered by coiled anger and simmering frustration, which finds its outlet in brutal fights and murderous rampages (the intense violence earned the film an NC-17 rating). The lack of moral position may bother some people, especially in light of Wright's sympathetic treatment of particular members of Hando's racist army, and the cold, hate-driven violence is sometimes hard to watch, but his vivid characters and richly drawn world create a compelling drama for adventurous filmgoers.--Sean Axmaker", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 551223}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6304431848", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510RV14D60L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Romper Stomper [VHS]"}

{"description": "What would the average sensible American do if he encountered a pulsing ball of protoplasm from outer space? That's right: he'd poke it with a stick. Thus begins the endearingly earnest and silly tale of The Blob. Young Steve McQueen takes on his first leading role as, um, Steve, a spunky teenager with plenty of heart. Steve sees the blob kill the local doc, but darn it, none of the town's adults will believe him! Yup, it's up to the teens to save the day! Steve and his trusty girlfriend Jane break their curfews(!) and head off into the night to find the Blob and warn the town. The Blob is a completely enjoyable watch from start to finish, offering the triple pleasures of 1950s morals, gee-whiz acting, and a whole lotta extras running around and screaming. The special effects, though primitive, certainly get the job done, and it is still a treat to watch the Blob ooze its way to its next meal. You may notice that the theme song is surprisingly bouncy for a horror flick (\"Beware of the Blob! It creeps, and leaps, and glides and slides across the floor\").

{"description": "Dashing Errol Flynn is the definitive Robin Hood in the most gloriously swashbuckling version of the legendary story. Warner Brothers reunited Michael Curtiz, their top-action director, with the winning team of Flynn and Olivia de Havilland (Maid Marian) and perennial villain Basil Rathbone as the aristocratic Sir Guy of Gisbourne, and pulled out all stops for the production. It became their costliest film to date, a grandly handsome, glowing Technicolor adventure set to a stirring,Oscar-winning scoreby Erich Wolfgang Korngold. The decadent Prince John (a smoothly conniving Claude Rains) takes advantage of King Richard's absence to tax the country into poverty but meets his match in the medieval guerrilla rebel Robin Hood and his Merry Men of Sherwood Forest, who rise up and, to quote a clich&eacute; coined by the film, \"steal from the rich and give to the poor.\" Stocky Alan Hale Sr. plays Robin's loyal friend Little John (a part he played in Douglas Fairbanks's silent version), Eugene Palette the portly Friar Tuck, and Melville Cooper the bumbling Sheriff of Nottingham. Flynn's confidence and cocky charm makes for a perfect Robin Hood, and his easygoing manner is a marvelous counterpoint to Rathbone's regal bearing and courtly diction. The film climaxes in their rousing battle-to-the-finish sword fight, a magnificently choreographed scene highlighted by Curtiz's inventive use of shadows cast upon the castle walls.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302120527", "6301976932", "6301977181", "6301977149", "6303212263", "6305123616", "B00004RFHL", "6301574117", "0790743159", "6300214060", "B00005A1VH", "6304178352", "0792839846", "630233683X", "6301977173", "6302961688", "630150528X", "6304935811", "B00005RRG6", "B00000JKNP", "6301973305", "6301670140", "1558800034", "0792107683", "B00004RGUU", "0782008348"], "bought_together": ["6301977149"], "also_viewed": ["B00005PJ8I"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 538065}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6304546386", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RMAFMQ02L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Adventures of Robin Hood [VHS]"}

Certainly this film (directed by French stylist Jean-Pierre Jeunet) is an improvement overAlien&nbsp;3, with a script that breathes exciting new life into the franchise. This chapter is set even further in the future, where scientists on a space colony have cloned both the alien and Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), who died inAlien&nbsp;3; in doing so, however, they've mixed alien DNA with Ripley's human chromosomes, which gives Ripley surprising power (and a bad attitude). A band of smugglers comes aboard only to discover  the new race of aliens--and when the multi-mouthed melonheads get loose, no place is safe. But, on the plus side, they have Ripley as a guide to help them get out.

{"description": "It may not be a disaster movie, per se, but this terminally silly thriller is certainly disastrous, and would be pointless without the novelty of its setting in a flooding Midwestern town during a torrential rainfall. Physically impressive but idiotic in every other respect, the movie pits an armored truck courier (Christian Slater) against a smart leader of thieves (Morgan Freeman) and a corruptible town sheriff (Randy Quaid) who are vying for possession of $3 million in cash. A waterlogged game of cat and mouse, the plot is so contrived that even the most impressive action sequences--such as a jet-ski chase through flooded high-school corridors--are robbed of their already tenuous credibility. Before long you'll be yawning as incompetent accomplices are systematically dispatched by their own stupidity, in the kind of movie where the use of power boats inevitably leads to at least one death by outboard motor.

{"description": "David O. Selznick wantedGone with the Windto be somehow more than a movie, a film that would broaden the very idea of what a film could be and do and look like. In many respects he got what he worked so hard to achieve in this 1939 epic (and all-time box-office champ in terms of tickets sold), and in some respects he fell far short of the goal. While the first half of this Civil War drama is taut and suspenseful and nostalgic, the second is ramshackle and arbitrary. But there's no question that the film is an enormous achievement in terms of its every resource--art direction, color, sound, cinematography--being pushed to new limits for the greater glory of telling an American story as fully as possible. Vivien Leigh is still magnificently narcissistic, Olivia de Havilland angelic and lovely, Leslie Howard reckless and aristocratic. As for Clark Gable: we're talking one of the most vital, masculine performances ever committed to film.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["6304117752", "0792839846", "6304178352", "630150528X", "6303215734", "B00000JS61", "0792151712", "0783222955", "0800116917", "6304151306", "630233683X", "6300183513", "0783221347", "6303494390", "B0000040EJ", "6302150620", "6300215814", "6301586026", "B00000F6D1", "6304274742", "6300215741", "0783235593", "B000056BRF", "6300215830", "6304400551", "6304239149", "6300185095", "6305282927", "0788806270", "6300207919", "6300213668", "6300181340", "6302610702", "5559477621", "6303854311", "B000059HH1", "6304039530", "0800100832", "B00004TYS8", "B00000JKNP", "B0000040EO", "6302936381", "6302227127", "6300215695", "6304039506", "6304994540", "6300277089", "6305576173", "630428635X", "6303020089", "B00005RRG3", "6301975987", "0783235607", "6301628454", "6300270971", "6303637574", "6300215628", "6304359705", "6304119046", "0792837207", "1558807780", "6300181987", "0783236352", "630251018X", "6302413435", "6303057225", "6301650514", "6304457316", "6300215512", "6301976061", "0800124693", "B000M7BEPQ", "B000005PPB", "630197350X", "6301976924", "0792837576", "B003UPPO2G", "6300267857", "B00005A1VG", "6301976983", "0790733897", "B00004RV8M", "6303651488", "6301969294", "6302241189", "6300246868", "B00000I1EM", "B0001E7LQG", "B00000F3QZ", "6303364772", "6303562248", "6304196954", "B00000FZCU", "6302640504", "6302360978", "0790733935", "6300181421", "6302484405", "6305718792"], "bought_together": ["6304117752", "6304178352"], "also_viewed": ["1451635621", "6304117752", "0792839846", "6304178352", "0800116917", "0792151712", "6304274742", "6304151306", "6303215734", "630233683X", "6304119046", "B00000JS61", "155890641X", "6305363668", "6304539258", "630018403X", "B002YZFBXA", "6302526574", "6300215598", "6300213668", "6301976983", "B0046ZE3LC", "6300215830", "0790743213", "6300182207", "6300181529", "B00000JGEI", "1558807780", "0792839129", "6304500831", "6304429274", "0784011923", "630150528X", "6304400225", "B00001IVED", "6300215717", "0788812408", "B00B7K0JZS", "0767825411", "B0000040EK", "B0000040EO", "0792158261", "B00008EYA5", "630141277X", "0800124693", "6302054982", "6303506291", "0783222955", "6300183211", "6300215814", "0790742322", "B00000JKNP", "B0000AM6IY", "B0000AQZYM", "0783216084", "6303402070", "6301797906", "630281622X", "6302961572"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 168297}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6305123616", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZGXJP009L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Gone With the Wind [VHS]"}
{"description": "If you were to argue that Mel Brooks'sYoung Frankensteinranks among the top-ten funniest movies of all time, nobody could reasonably dispute the claim. Spoofing classic horror in the way that Brooks's previous filmBlazing Saddlessent up classic Westerns, the movie is both a loving tribute and a raucous, irreverent parody of Universal's classic horror filmsFrankenstein(1931) andBride of Frankenstein(1935). Filming in glorious black and white, Brooks re-created theFrankensteinlaboratory using the same equipment from the originalFrankenstein(courtesy of designer Kenneth Strickfaden), and this loving attention to physical and stylistic detail creates a solid foundation for nonstop comedy. The story, of course, involves Frederick Frankenstein (Gene Wilder) and his effort to resume experiments in re-animation pioneered by his late father. (He's got some help, since dad left behind a book titledHow I Did It.) Assisting him is the hapless hunchback Igor (Marty Feldman) and the buxom but none-too-bright maiden Inga (Teri Garr), and when Frankenstein succeeds in creating his monster (Peter Boyle), the stage is set for an outrageous revision of the Frankenstein legend. With comedy highlights too numerous to mention, Brooks guides his brilliant cast (also including Cloris Leachman, Madeline Kahn, Kenneth Mars, and Gene Hackman in a classic cameo role) through scene after scene of inspired hilarity. Indeed,Young Frankensteinis a charmed film, nothing less than a comedy classic, representing the finest work from everyone involved. Not one joke has lost its payoff, and none of the countless gags have lost their zany appeal. From a career that includes some of the best comedies ever made, this is the film for which Mel Brooks will be most fondly remembered. Befitting a classic, the Special Edition DVD includes audio commentary by Mel Brooks, a \"making of\" documentary, interviews with the cast, hilarious bloopers and outtakes, and the original theatrical trailers. No video library should be without a copy ofYoung Frankenstein.

{"description": "Here's a sick little movie for you--a creepy-funny shocker that's become a semi-cult classic since its release in 1982. It's a cheesy, low-budget horror flick about a small-town geek who arrives in New York City's Times Square carrying his mutant, telepathic twin brother in a big basket (hence the movie's title, get it?). They were once Siamese twins, and now they're seeking gory revenge against the doctors who surgically separated them against their will! Talk about brotherly love! The \"normal\" sibling has to keep his brother well- fed, and the basket-dweller's appetite runs the gamut from hamburgers to hookers. There's plenty of lowlife \"meat\" to be found in the seedy motel where the brothers live. Not exactly mainstream fare, as you might already have guessed, but director Frank Henenlotter handles the gruesomeness with resourceful ingenuity. The movie even gathered enough horror-buff momentum to spawn two lesser sequels in 1990 and 1992, which is all the proof you need to add this dubious trilogy to the gross-out hall of fame.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000V6LT08", "B008S2CTWY", "B000094J72", "B0053TWW9K", "B00004Z1GI", "B008CYDD7I", "B000068TPD", "B000JU7JIW", "B000096I9V", "B0007WQHI0", "B0024FAG44", "B000IJ7A5Q", "B0002DB5PO", "B00DWG5GIA", "B0053TWW36", "B000GIXCL0", "B000HT38B2", "157362408X", "B008DL4LN0", "B0002VYOVS", "B001D5C1R6", "B0002C9DK4", "B0036R92US", "6305841985", "B004KDYR20", "B004FUPK6U", "B000UDGO9S", "B000S0GYRU", "B00ARWX9NG", "B009IV2Z3M", "0783228457", "B0001ZX0GK", "B00009YXHN", "B00009WNXA", "B001BP14MG", "B000HXDWRS", "B0016MJ6P6", "B00004KDER", "B002E01MHY", "B0057O6IMS", "B00AGKH4MG", "B00023P4SS", "B001D5C1OO", "B00005N5RM", "B000T28POC", "B000RPCK2O", "B005ZHBEPI", "B001B8XRT6", "B0002IQLH6", "B000S0GYRK", "6304723113", "B000F3UA8E", "B000WC389G", "B005CVFZ66", "B0001US7OA", "B0006FO56Y", "B000OYCMLM", "B00009PY4C", "630472313X", "B000FS9FE4", "B0053TWWAE", "B004EI2NP4", "B003L1YESE", "B001M0NJ0K", "B00CERJI5U", "B0016LFG2E", "B0002Z0F12", "B000MX7V3O", "B0000DC12T", "B003JIPN20", "B001QMCJ4Q", "B0055HK79C", "B000TZJCN2", "B0009OUBC4", "B005OT7ZWI", "B0072GPQ8G", "B000E8M0P6", "B00BTYPW7C", "B00JQYV0B4", "B0002S9QUA", "B003THSXJ6", "B002I41KNC", "B0055CP9TU", "B0053TWV46", "B000IMUYJM", "B005OT810I", "6304852444", "B00GHH9IIA", "B000RPCJA2", "B004VQRCJG", "B0053TWVQE", "B008DVJOQ4", "B0009X768W", "B000068IEV", "B000MV8ABS", "B000E1P2EY", "069220315X", "B0000694WL", "B00DOZNGTK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00004Z1GI", "B008N02TGC", "B00DWG5GIA", "B000068TPD"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 464932}, "asin": "6305186677", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/513TPA33T4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Basket Case"}
{"description": "Halloweenis one of the great modern horror films, but as a franchise its track record has been spotty at best, painfully bad at worst.Halloween H2O: Twenty Years Later, directed by horror vet Steve Miner (Friday the 13thparts 2 and 3,House), won't displace John Carpenter's original but it might help you forget the films in between. Miner certainly has: the film begins as if sequels 3 through 6 never happened. Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis, reprising her role for the first time in almost two decades) faked her death and is now a single mom and headmistress of an exclusive California private school. She's also a secret alcoholic who lives in fear of her homicidal brother-bogeyman Michael Myers. Guess who decides to show up for a family reunion? The film begins with classic horror-movie exposition (the deserted college campus, Michael's escape, Laurie's waking nightmares) accomplished with some humor and style, but it's all setup for the second half, a driving roller coaster of stalk-and-slash thrills. There's little of the self-conscious genre referencing ofScreamand at times the film is a little far-fetched--it is a slasher movie about a knife-wielding homicidal maniac who won't stay dead, after all--but Curtis transforms Laurie from a shrieking victim into an empowered, determined horror-movie heroine who's learned a thing or two from the previous films.

{"description": "Max Oph&uuml;ls explores the scandalous life of dancer and courtesan Lola Montes with a bittersweet empathy that turns melodrama into a tragic melancholy masterpiece. Using the theatrical re-creation of Lola's life in a big-top pageant as a framing device, Oph&uuml;ls contrasts the outrageous sensationalism of her reputation with poignant, poetic flashbacks that explore her many affairs, most notably with Franz Liszt (Will Quadflieg) and King Ludwig of Bavaria (Anton Walbrook). Lola's greatest tragedy is that she loved well, if not too wisely. If Martine Carol's central performance is lacking passion, as many critics have argued, her quiet, at times seemingly passive demeanor makes her a veritable prisoner of her society and her reputation. Swept along by Oph&uuml;ls's sweeping camerawork, which glides through the film in a balance of intimacy and contemplative remove as if on the wings of angels, her life becomes like a cinematic ballet with Oph&uuml;ls the choreographer and conductor. Peter Ustinov costars as the jaded circus ringmaster, who nightly narrates her exploits to a throng of scandal-hungry spectators, while she performs with a face hardened in indifference, resigned to her empty role as a figure of spectacle in a garish gilded cage.  Shot in delicate color and impeccably composed widescreen compositions throughout by Oph&uuml;ls's regular cinematographer Christian Matras,Lola Montesis his most beautiful and restrained film, a fitting swan song for one of the cinema's most sensitive directors.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001BEK8BK", "B001BEK8C4", "B001BEK8BU", "B00AQ6J5YA", "B008NNSDSC", "B00DZP1BUU", "B00005A8TW", "B000093NR0", "B008Y5OVZ8", "B00HE011DE", "B000NOK0H6", "B00HE010QM", "B008NNSDBY", "B00005JKGX", "B004WPYO7E", "B003ICZW7I", "B008CJ0JS4", "B00005AUK9", "B004A30AW6", "B000BC8SWO", "B00023P4GA", "B005KQVE1S", "B00D9BNONW", "B00GPPXNIK", "B008Y5OXB0", "B00005BCK0", "B0012Z361M", "B000B8384Q", "B00HRJVHEK", "B000XQ4HQO", "B00007CVS2", "B00IGK6TGU", "B008CJ0JPW", "B001BSBBDK", "B00CEIOHPU", "B000067IY7", "B0000687DE", "B00CN70M60", "B00B2BYXSQ", "B003ZYU3U0", "B001D8W7EK", "B004CIIXDC", "B00005K3NV", "B000BGH2NG", "B0087ZG7R0", "B000ZM1MJG", "B00007L4I6", "B00005JKPT", "B001LMU19G", "B00CUKTGSA", "B00AQ6J64O", "0780022343", "B00003CXC9", "B005ND87UY", "B000Y14U5Q", "B000OPPADS", "B00D23GPH4", "B000A88EV4", "B0035ECHVI", "B00005UQ7R", "B00003CXBU", "B00005UQ7Q", "B00005QAPJ", "B0016B6ZEC", "B0002V7O0Q", "B0009WIE2K", "B00BSN0VZW", "B009RWRINE", "B0030H16W6", "B00BX49BGQ", "B00005A06N", "B0007989ZC", "B00B2BYY1M", "B005EXA8MS", "B00005JLV7", "B005HK13S6", "6305999872", "B00DZP1C9K", "B00064AEWY", "B0000A0DTV", "B00007CVS4", "B0006Z2NE0", "B000305ZYS", "B00005QW59", "B00006RCO1", "B000FFJYA2", "B00008H2GR", "B004P9UWM8", "B002E01MAG", "B001D8W7EU", "B00406UJZG", "B000094J75", "B00022LJ7O", "B000FFJYAW", "1572528060", "B000BR6QCS", "B000BT994S", "B0006Z2NB8", "B002TZS5GA", "B0000E69HD"], "bought_together": ["B001BEK8BK", "B001BEK8C4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001BEK8BK", "B001BEK8C4", "B008NNSDSC", "B001BEK8BU"]}, "price": 20.41, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 339791}, "asin": "630522885X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZKJHRE1HL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Lola Montes"}

{"description": "Charlize Theron is the latest stunning blonde to be hanging around some big ape in a Hollywood movie, this one a remake of the 1949 semi-classic with echoes of the superiorKing Kong. Theron plays the daugher of an American researcher killed by poachers in Africa. The baby gorilla left in her care grows up to become a hugely tall and broad specimen named Joe, living in the mountains as a mostly unseen legend among people who live there. Along comes an eco-minded emissary (Bill Paxton) from a California sanctuary, who talks the jungle girl into providing safe haven for Joe at the L.A. facility. The transition is not without discomfort, but everything is aggravated via a conspiracy of poachers to get Joe into their own greedy hands. Director Ron Underwood (City Slickers) uses a combination of special-effects techniques to give Joe life and personality, and he succeeds quite effectively. The requisite giant-ape-goes-amok scenes are all in place--a couple of them pretty intense--as is a conclusion that finds the simian hero performing a stunning feat of escalation. Underwood attempts to give a little modern spin to some classic Hollywood conventions regarding wild hearts lost in civilization, and the results are pretty agreeable family fare.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00003CXQX", "0788809806", "B00001YX9H", "0788812181", "6305177473", "B000035Z2S", "0788805533", "B000035Z46", "0788812408", "6303929478", "B00000ICHA", "B000JTATHG", "B00005JKX3", "6304500831", "6305319138", "B00003CXHR", "B0000E32WB", "6305940932", "6304401736", "B00000ICHI", "B000063V8N", "6304501153", "6304290888", "B00004R99B", "B0002YLCHE", "B00005T7H6", "B00000IZ00", "078880782X", "B00000J2JA", "6300274608", "B00000I7Q3", "6304416415", "078880720X", "B00004R99N", "B00335EQ0E", "6304311834", "B00005RDVV", "B00016JF2W", "6303315305", "0788812440", "B000009CTR", "6304293968", "6304030959", "6302426200", "6304155972", "078881107X", "6303168957", "6304400225", "B00003CXWI", "6305942285", "B0000TG9Z6", "B00005B24W", "B000089G5P", "0788810677", "B00003CXQ6", "6304501668", "6303039456", "0788810995", "B00005JLR1", "B00020HAME", "B00004T2SI", "6302746590", "B000035Z4W", "6304089627", "6301106563"], "bought_together": ["B00003CXQX"], "also_viewed": ["6303983812", "6304089767", "6302526574", "6304100507", "155890641X", "6305326940", "0788812807", "B000035Z2S", "6305942285", "6302426200", "6305319138", "0788812181", "6305229449", "6304290888", "0788805533", "6304500831", "6302787068", "6300274195", "6304400551", "6303929338", "B00003CXHR", "6304401132", "B0007KTBIU", "B00005KAQI", "6304873441", "B00005RDVV", "6303314015", "6304978286", "6300275310", "078880782X", "B00004R99N", "6305177473", "B00005B24W", "0783222203", "6305870160", "B00003CXXI", "B00000GUNY", "6301991311", "B00001IVFU", "B00004REYY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 151214}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.84, "brand": "", "asin": "6305318867", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HB928CZEL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Mighty Joe Young  [VHS]"}

And guided by four of our most imaginative moviemakers, we traveled there again in 1983.\n\nTwilight Zone -- The Movie is a spellbinding destination, as directors John Landis, Steven Spielberg, Joe Dante and George Miller fashion stories based on or inspired by classic episodes. Landis weaves the tale of a bigot who gets a walloping dose of his own hatred. Spielberg takes over with a fable of senior citizens offered a magical rejuvenation. Dante serves up a terror trip with a child who uses his cartoon-inspired powers to enslave his family. Then fear goes aloft with Miller's finale about a neurotic passenger who sees a monster on the jetliner's wing.

{"description": "A high-profile action/exploitation thriller set in the present,The Siegeis really a fantasy that extrapolates from major terrorist attacks. Denzel Washington is FBI special agent Hubbard, \"Hub\" to his friends, whose anti-terrorist task force must track down the terrorist cells responsible for a spate of bombings in New York.  His partner is an FBI agent of Arabian extraction (played convincingly by Tony Shalhoub), proving not all Arabs are bad guys--a point the film should be lauded for making again and again. Thrown into the mix is a CIA spy (played almost kittenish at times by Annette Bening), whose ties to the terrorists appear to be at the center of the conflicts.  When the bombings escalate out of control, the President institutes martial law, sending in General Devereaux (played with impenetrable countenance by Bruce Willis) with tanks and troops to ferret out the terrorists. Echoes of Japanese-Americans in internment camps ring out as Arabs, including the son of the Arab-American FBI agent, are herded into a stadium.

{"description": "A strong cast, impressive production values, and astute direction distinguish this generally successful dramatization of the tumultuous life of the 15th-century French heroine whose military victories were eclipsed by her martyrdom. At the heart of the story is the conflict between the teenager's simple but fierce faith and the more complex political and theological issues that influence her downfall, a theme fleshed out through the portrayals of the young warrior's liege, the Dauphin (later King) Charles, and the Bishop Cauchon.The 140-minute feature follows Joan D'Arc's odyssey from peasant obscurity to notoriety as the \"Maid of Orleans,\" spiritual fulcrum for the beleaguered French forces struggling to halt English invaders.  As played by Leelee Sobieski (Eyes Wide Shut), her evolution from naive farm girl to seasoned soldier is convincing, as is her gradual awakening to the underlying agendas of church and state. Most critically, Sobieski radiates the young girl's fervent spiritual devotion.Framing Sobieski's focal performance are two equally fine turns from Neil Patrick Harris, who erases his legacy as TV'sDoogie Howser, M.D.with a neatly shaded, steely Charles, and Peter O'Toole, who balances his signature reserve and present physical frailty to make Cauchon a moral compass for the story. Having opposed Joan as a threat to orthodoxy, the Bishop recognizes her purity too late; O'Toole turns this moment into a dreadful epiphany that resonates through the story's inevitable, fiery denouement. Fine supporting performances from Peter Strauss, Shirley MacLaine, and Maximillian Schell, plus evocative medieval locations in the Czech Republic, further buttress the story. French-Canadian director Christian Duguay handles the large-scale battle sequences with fluid blocking and smart camera work.--Sam Sutherland", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000EU1OXI"], "bought_together": ["0767845722"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 210169}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 2.85, "brand": "", "asin": "6305535582", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51WJFSVR4WL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Joan of Arc [VHS]"}

{"description": "Flavored with Americana and loaded with cinematic inventiveness, \"Steamboat Bill, Jr.\" (1928, 69 min.) was Buster Keaton's final independent production before joining MGM (where his work suffered a steady decline in quality), a comic masterpiece that represents the full breath of its maker's remarkable talents.  Set on the Mississippi River, \"Steamboat Bill, Jr.\" follows the adventures of a spoiled young man who is forced by his crusty father (Ernest Torrence) to learn riverboating. Over the course of the narrative, the scale of comedy gradually expands, from small-scale, nostalgic humor (as when Bill Sr. outfits his son with a new wardrobe) to some of the most elaborate sight gags of Keaton's career. Junior's attempts to single-handedly pilot the rag-tag \"Stonewall Jackson\" recall the mechanical brilliance of The General and The Navigator, but the films crowning achievement is its hurricane climax. Highlighted by remarkable special effects, the film includes the legendary stunt in which the front of a building collapses over Junior, who passes unharmed through an open window. Added to this DVD are two Keaton shorts. Surprisingly dark yet wickedly funny, \"Convict 13\" (1920, 20 min.) combines gallows humor with rapid-fire slapstick. In \"Daydreams\" (1922, 22 min.), Buster tries to establish himself in a profession--from veterinary assistant to street-sweeper to actor--and, in one of his most cleverly staged chases, is pursued by a herd of New York City \"bulls.\" Digitally mastered from archival prints, with original musical scores.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001E18222", "B004XEEMA8", "B0041CGOZ8", "B008BWFOXC", "B005SDB8H8", "B004IMDCK6", "B007N5YJPC", "B0056HTEKO", "B003ZYU3TG", "B00049QQ78", "B00BX49BGQ", "B00AOCDE7U", "B004OOL73W", "B000A7DVMM", "B00D9BNONW", "B000VUQ4HW", "B004NWPY7A", "B000E1EHQI", "B00005RF2C", "6305701245", "B00652FG60", "B00AEFZDNA", "B000B5XORU", "B0009S4IKG", "B002NTDX6O", "B007AAEZ7W", "B0040QYROK", "0306801787", "B00007CVS8", "B005MY2J12", "B00003ETHH", "B000B5XORA", "B0002HOEJY", "B00014NF6G", "B0040QYROA", "B00006JMQG", "B0002CHIFG", "0783233582", "B00097DXG2", "B000G8NXYG", "B00393SG0G", "6305131104", "B0085A9K3K", "B000021Y7O", "B0012KHTEC", "B0007RTB9M", "B003H221M8", "B0002CHIEM", "B00004Z4W3", "B000FS9FLW", "6305761078", "B005BYBZKY", "B00652FG38", "B00K6D1QV8", "B000HT3QBO", "B00000ILF9", "B00006IUIU", "B00000ILEU", "B000FFJ83A", "B000I8OM94", "B008ZDC7M8", "B000O599NA", "B0016A2FHO", "B00652FG4M", "B00DZP1C9K", "B000AM4PJU", "B004GJYR7I", "B0000549B0", "B003ZEQMH8", "B000FFJYAW", "0691004420", "B0024R1CF4", "B00007L4MK", "0810942275"], "bought_together": ["B001E18222", "B004XEEMA8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001E18222", "B0041CGOZ8", "B004XEEMA8", "6305701261"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 353624}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.98, "brand": "Kino International", "asin": "6305609950", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515697EH17L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Steamboat Bill Jr."}
{"description": "OK, let's get all the disclaimers out of the way first. Despite its colorful (if crude) animation,South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncutis in no way meant for kids. It is chock full of profanity that might even make Quentin Tarantino blanch and has blasphemous references to God, Satan, Saddam Hussein (who's sleeping with Satan, literally), and Canada. It's rife with scatological humor, suggestive sexual situations, political incorrectness, and gleeful, rampant vulgarity. And it's probably one of the most brilliant satires ever made. The plot: flatulent Canadian grossmeistersTerrance and Philip hit the big screen, and the South Park quartet of third graders--Stan, Kyle, Kenny, and Cartman--begin repeating their profane one-liners ad infinitum. The parents of South Park, led by Kyle's overbearing mom, form \"Mothers Against Canada,\" blaming their neighbors to the north for their children's corruption and taking Terrance and Philip as war prisoners. It's up to the kids then to rescue their heroes from execution, not mention a brooding Satan, who's planning to take over the world.To give away any more of the plot would destroy the fun, but this feature-length version of Trey Parker and Matt Stone's Comedy Central hit is a dead-on and hilarious send-up of pop culture. And did we mention it's amusical? From the opening production number \"Mountain Town\" to the cheerful antiprofanity sing-along \"It's Easy, MMMKay\" to Satan's faux-Disney ballad \"Up There,\" Parker (who wrote or cowrote all the songs) brilliantly shoots down every earnest musical fromBeauty and the BeasttoLes Mis&eacute;rables. And in advocating free speech and satirizing well-meaning but misguided parental censorship groups (with a special nod to the MPAA),Bigger, Longer & Uncuthits home against adult paranoia and hypocrisy with a vengeance. And the jokes, while indeed vulgar and gross, are hysterical; we can't repeat them here, especially the lyrics to Terrance and Philip's hit song, but you'll be rolling on the floor.

{"description": "Based on the true story that captured the hearts of America, THE STRAIGHT STORY is one of those rare films offering powerful, uplifting entertainment for audiences of all ages. Directed by acclaimed director David Lynch (WILD AT HEART, MULHOLLAND DRIVE), this gentle, inspiring film celebrates the human spirit. Richard Farnsworth (MISERY, THE NATURAL) stars as Alvin Straight -- a no-nonsense man who has never been one to lean on others. Now at an age when his eyesight denies him the ability to drive and walking is accomplished only with the help of two canes, Alvin lives a quiet life with his daughter Rose (Sissy Spacek). But when the call comes that Alvin's estranged brother Lyle (Harry Dean Stanton, THE GREEN MILE) has suffered a debilitating stroke, Alvin embarks on a dangerous and emotional journey to make amends. With little money, but plenty of patience and tenacity, he climbs aboard his 1966 John Deere lawnmower and plots the 260-mile course from his small Iowa town to Lyle's home in Wisconsin. Filmed along the actual route that the real Alvin Straight traveled in 1994, THE STRAIGHT STORY is a heartwarming and poignant drama chronicling Alvin's six-week odyssey and the many lives he touches along the way.", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301166671", "6302130379", "1558800034", "630273973X"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 258168}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 19.9, "brand": "", "asin": "6305810109", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/417N0XRFVWL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Straight Story [VHS]"}

{"description": "Too silly to work as a police series, but too violent to play as a comedy, this over-the-top series vacillates between extremes but never achieves a satisfactory resolution. The Warrior Strike Team represents the elite of the Tokyo police force in the not-too-distant future. Except for Yuji, the lone, ineffectual male, its members are women who seem to specialize in skimpy outfits: blond heroine Rio, sharpshooter Maya, computer expert Lelica--aided by techno-wizard Nanvel and shrewd commander Maki. They're pitted against a gang of ruthless criminals who have created a \"virtual drug,\" a sort of electronic mind-control system. The screenplay by Katsuhiko Kochiba and Sumio Uetake tries to build suspense, then undercuts it with slapstick sexual humor and vice versa. Episode 3 begins with the perennially broke Rio trying to sell her used underwear to a sex-shop dealer but ends with a violent bloodbath in which her best friend is killed. When Rio sobs over her friend's murder, it's staged so that the camera is peeking up her skirt. Many anime series successfully juggle comedy and violent conflicts (Cowboy Bebop,Gunsmith Cats, for example) butBurn-Up Wnever gels. Suitable for ages 18 and up: nudity, profanity, sexual humor, violence, violence against women.--Charles Solomon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00006CY43", "B00006CY4F", "B00007JZO2", "B00006CY41", "B0029KS9GG", "B0001I568M", "B005D5P8KY", "B0006SSQWU", "B0002IQH1Q", "B00IOFDKMS", "B00E689HGK", "B0017LGQJU", "B005S0STWS", "B00BCPOFQ2", "B00KVRK39A", "B00CU6WBMW", "B00005TPCD", "B00004Y9PW", "B0007939U2", "B00C3JUKJC", "B00BCPOFPS", "B00CU6WBFE", "B00II4S0K2", "B008NNY9HQ", "B00BY8DNBA", "B00CU6WBSQ", "B00F9F975A", "B00E688GU8", "B00008G6U3", "B00II50JLE", "B0009WFFCM", "B00AUJH39M", "B003SPDS8U", "B009AVC9BI", "B00CDV4R26", "B00440OG2A", "6305419639", "B00HXEWFUY", "B00GS1YP6A", "B0002VKZR0", "B00KZJX8HS", "B00004YS8F", "B00GS18CK0", "B00AIZ2LR2", "B00CDV4OR4", "B00009B8D4", "B008YRL6SQ", "B000T4T8Z0", "B004LBA07M", "B000HT386W", "B00HFC7LYO", "B00114UUMW", "B00F9F7MKC", "B00GS20I7Y", "B003NE8B4M", "B00DJ5IPTQ", "B00E688XI8", "B00CJ7XZFO", "B00008DDSL", "B00BLQRFSM", "B0000A9GLV", "B00A8305MW", "B0000296QB", "B000VKL6RU", "B00C3JU7UO", "B005DEUF1C", "B00A8304IC", "B00ENNEKQ0", "B005DEUEVI", "B000095J2L", "B001US3XQ4", "B00CU6WBOU", "B000767QR2", "B000228SZK", "B0029KS9G6", "193786779X", "B000NNUWYI", "B0083QJVLC", "B001J0FVWW", "B00B1RB8V6", "B000087F31", "B0072GPQJK", "B00E688U9K", "B00005B1VN", "B0088FS1F0", "B004LIYF6W", "B004STBFBM", "B001N2WJ1W", "1626920311", "B00031TX6S", "B008KZX7T8", "B0050UEVKK", "B009B82FCS", "B002BWD764", "B00B1RB81Q", "B006MWA974", "B009SQWOHY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00007JZO2", "B00006CY41", "B00006CY43", "B00006CY4F"]}, "price": 10.29, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 195375}, "asin": "6305858357", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DZ08JYHRL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Burn Up W"}

{"description": "Edward Scissorhandsachieves the nearly impossible feat of capturing the delicate flavor of a fable or fairy tale in a live-action movie. The story follows a young man named Edward (Johnny Depp), who was created by an inventor (Vincent Price, in one of his last roles) who died before he could give the poor creature a pair of human hands. Edward lives alone in a ruined Gothic castle that just happens to be perched above a pastel-colored suburb inhabited by breadwinning husbands and frustrated housewives straight out of the 1950s. One day, Peg (Dianne Wiest), the local Avon lady, comes calling. Finding Edward alone, she kindly invites him to come home with her, where she hopes to help him with his pasty complexion and those nasty nicks he's given himself with his razor-sharp fingers. Soon Edward's skill with topiary sculpture and hair design make him popular in the neighborhood--but the mood turns just as swiftly against the outsider when he starts to feel his own desires, particularly for Peg's daughter Kim (Winona Ryder). Most of director Tim Burton's movies (such asPee Wee's Big Adventure,Beetlejuice,Batman) are visual spectacles with elements of fantasy, butEdward Scissorhandsis more tender and personal than the others. Edward's wild black hair is much like Burton's, suggesting that the character represents the director's own feelings of estrangement and co-option. Johnny Depp, making his first successful leap from TV to film, captures Edward's childlike vulnerability even while his physical posture evokes horror icons like the vampire inNosferatuand the sleepwalker inThe Cabinet of Dr. Caligari. Classic horror films, at their heart, feel a deep sympathy for the monsters they portray; simply and affectingly,Edward Scissorhandslays that heart bare.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B001AGXEA6", "B008MU8ZM0", "B00AEBBA1I", "B00AEBB9V4", "B008UZBHYU", "B000I5XOWI", "B003UMW68Y", "B0065AO94W", "B001EZE5BU", "B008BSM1GO", "B008QE9VJI", "B0043EV774", "B00GR76W1Q", "B005LAIIA8", "B000M9BPEY", "B005DZ35RC", "B007NPKPN2", "B002UOMGZQ", "B00288KNJU", "B003M8NG94", "B004P29LEU", "B008U0XRD4", "B005DZ35TU", "B000JSI7B2", "B001O8DB1W", "B000NA22C6", "B002S6L6XY", "B000002OFD", "B004VLZUI6", "B0088EDMMS", "B005HARX4Y", "B004SIP7QC", "B001AQR3E4", "B00AJCUL2G", "B003L4Y5B2", "B0039208JE", "B0054QHHHE", "B002QEHPR4", "B0027VTMAE", "B001CO42MU", "B001AR4K8K", "B003UESJLK", "B001IKKMCW", "B000WUMLU0", "B006MOYH0M", "B00993FEUK", "B003ZHR6PW", "B00C888MJ8", "B001AQT0UY", "B00AEFXXFU", "B0039208QM", "B00164GDA0", "B005KQVDH8", "B001HN69B8", "B001D8W7CW", "B000WSLAUO", "B00005R87R", "B00FAI3JE6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001AGXEA6", "B008MU8ZM0", "B00AEBBA1I", "B008FD36IC"]}, "price": 8.5, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 449136}, "asin": "B000005QLO", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/511ADGQ59YL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Edward Scissorhands"}

As the grueling routine begins to get to them, each reacts to the stress in different way. Bottoms's character becomes consumed with winning the attention and approval of the school's crankiest teacher, the crusty Prof. Kingsfield, the role that won \"newcomer\" John Houseman an Oscar.

He has been allowed a second chance at life after a long stay in a mental institution and returns to the streets where he grew up; sent to a halfway house under the stern but unsupervised watch of Mrs.Wilkenson (Lynn Redgrave). The sights, sounds and smells of revisiting the familiar streets of his old neighborhood send Spider further down a shadowy path that reawakens memories of his where his mother (Miranda Richardson) and his father (Gabriel Byrne) raised him.

{"description": "When Steven Spielberg was an adolescent, his first home movie was a backyard war film. When he toured Europe withDuelin his 20s, he saw old men crumble in front of headstones at Omaha Beach. That image became the opening scene ofSaving Private Ryan, his film of a mission following the D-day invasion that many have called the most realistic--and maybe the best--war film ever. With 1998 production standards, Spielberg has been able to create a stunning, unparalleled view of war as hell. We are at Omaha Beach as troops are slaughtered by Germans yet overcome the almost insurmountable odds.A stalwart Tom Hanks plays Captain Miller, a soldier's soldier, who takes a small band of troops behind enemy lines to retrieve a private whose three brothers have recently been killed in action. It's a public relations move for the Army, but it has historical precedent dating back to the Civil War. Some critics of the film have labeled the central characters stereotypes. If that is so, this movie gives stereotypes a good name: Tom Sizemore as the deft sergeant, Edward Burns as the hotheaded Private Reiben, Barry Pepper as the religious sniper, Adam Goldberg as the lone Jew, Vin Diesel as the oversize Private Caparzo, Giovanni Ribisi as the soulful medic, and Jeremy Davies, who as a meek corporal gives the film its most memorable performance.The movie is as heavy and realistic as Spielberg's Oscar-winningSchindler's List, but it's more kinetic. Spielberg and his ace technicians (the film won five Oscars: editing (Michael Kahn), cinematography (Janusz Kaminski), sound, sound effects, and directing) deliver battle sequences that wash over the eyes and hit the gut. The violence is extreme but never gratuitous. The final battle, a dizzying display of gusto, empathy, and chaos, leads to a profound repose.Saving Private Ryantouches us deeper thanSchindlerbecause it succinctly links the past with how we should feel today. It's the film Spielberg was destined to make.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00006C7G9", "6303168507", "6303057225", "B00AEBBA36", "6302529441", "0800125762", "6304935811", "B00003CXTF", "B000EHSVS2", "0790734060", "6303257844", "6302415853", "B0007TKNGA", "6301247345", "6301662954", "0790734079", "6302610702", "6302909023", "630407185X", "0783221347", "079213690X", "0800132009", "0790701251", "6305363668", "6301115430", "0790752395", "6304071876", "6300268748"], "bought_together": ["B00006C7G9"], "also_viewed": ["0792151712", "6301792734", "0792837614", "B00003CXXO", "6303109950", "6304117752", "6303402348", "6303168507", "B00003CXTF", "B000RC7QVC", "0783221347", "078323662X", "630018627X", "6304151306", "0783230095", "6304233639", "B0000040EJ", "6303187064"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 269908}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 0.5, "brand": "", "asin": "B00000K3AM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4143F912CXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Saving Private Ryan [VHS]"}
{"description": "The first half of Dario Argento's heady psycho-thriller is a mesmerizing merging of dream and reality. A beautiful young Italian detective (Asia Argento, who does little to convince us she's a tough, seasoned cop) investigating a serial rapist is suddenly overwhelmed when the paintings in an art museum erupt with life. According to the film, this is \"the Stendhal Syndrome,\" an intense and overwhelming response to art that turns the viewer mad. As Anna steps in and out of fantasy worlds like Alice through the looking glass, she's kidnapped by her quarry, who repeatedly rapes and tortures her in a dark, dank underground cave. The delirious nightmare of shattered reality becomes a sadistic, mean-spirited spectacle of murder and degradation--perpetrated on, of all people, the director's own bound and beaten daughter!--and the thriller disintegrates into a paranoid mystery of amnesia, split psyches, and shadowy phantoms. At its best this is a mesmerizing vision of madness: paintings melt into the real world while objectivity disintegrates before our eyes. But before the unexpectedly sensitive conclusion, Argento puts the viewer through a bravura but brutal series of gory murders (a slow-motion bullet passes through both cheeks of a helpless victim, and another shooting is viewed from inside the body) and unsavory violence.

{"description": "Not the egregious foul it seemed to be in theaters,Herculesstands up as an entertaining spritzer of an animated feature. The continual peppering of in-jokes and cultural references becomes less irksome on video. That there's no majesty or awe invested in the beloved Greek legends also seems less of an error. Also on the plus side is the bounciest Alan Menken music sinceLittle Shop of Horrors. With Zeus's blood in his veins, young Hercules's amazing strength makes him an outcast (sorry, that still doesn't fly), so he trains with a satyr named Phil to become a hero. Along the way Herc meets Meg, a common mortal who falls hard for him. They're both against the jocular Hades, who has to destroy Hercules to take over Olympus.

{"description": "With a voracious trio of mako sharks wreaking havoc,Deep Blue  Seadares to up the ante onJaws, but director Renny Harlin trades the nuanced suspense of Spielberg's 1975 blockbuster for the trickery of the digital age. In other words, why build genuine terror when you can show ill-fated humans getting torn into bloody chunks? The aforementioned makos have been lab rats in an effort to harvest a miracle cure for Alzheimer's disease from the brains of sharks, but the research has an unfortunate side effect: the sharks get smarter, and they're determined to break out of Aquatica, the deep-sea complex where they've been penned.Model-actress Saffron Burrows plays the researcher; Thomas Jane pulls double-duty as shark expert and action hunk; Samuel&nbsp;L. Jackson's the corporate sponsor who chooses theworsttime for an Aquatica tour; and rapper LL&nbsp;Cool&nbsp;J is nicely cast as Aquatica's cook and comic  relief. Michael Rapaport, Jacqueline McKenzie, and Stellan Skarsg&aring;rd round out the cast, most of whom are turned into shark food as the makos turn Aquatica into a floating junkyard. Harlin takes devilish pleasure in providing sudden, unexpected shocks--no small feat in such a derivative thriller--and  as a series of action set-pieces,Deep Blue Seanever disappoints. It's inevitable that Burrows should end up in her underwear like Sigourney Weaver inAlien, but even then the movie offers a credible reason for the strip-down; thatDeep Blue Seacan be simultaneously ridiculous and sensible is just another one of its shlocky charms.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B008DL4LQ2", "0767802497", "B00008WFU5", "B0006HBZYC", "B00008WFU4", "B00005A8XX", "6305090564", "B004USUP58", "B003VA3JUO", "B000WTVZGC", "B002NZK5U0", "B00AEFYXQI", "6305943133", "B007STBUHI", "B003ZZ7TPG", "0783225547", "B001YYQ9S8", "B00153ZR8G", "B00AIZ2FPK", "B00005O5B5", "B00064X5L6", "B00064AE0G", "B00AEFYSR2", "B000JBXHQY", "B0002V7OI8", "B00E8G5HQE", "B005CHV14A", "B004FHCHAU", "B00018D3UU", "B00DCLTA6Y", "B000BNX3BE", "B003ABZG14", "B003954IV0", "B00BTYNXJG", "B000NVT0TI", "0767817478", "B000N4RAS8", "B000ASATZ8", "B00000IQC4", "B001DSNEK6", "B00000IQVQ", "B00000G3PA", "B004K4FUVQ", "B00008G8M4", "B002O3Z50G", "0783237413", "B00004STDN", "B004XVMCN0", "B002ZG98LO", "0792839684", "B00005UQ9W", "B000PFU83O", "B0010X73ZG", "B00013RC7K", "B00AEFXPMG", "B004LWZW6K", "B00005JOWW", "B00003L9CQ", "B004AC6PV2", "B0002W4SBI", "B000WTVZGW", "B003UN0752", "B0002IQMAM", "B00005JM5B", "B00BNAE14W", "B00AEFXPSK", "B004P7CN7W", "B000X0GWNG", "B00005RYKU", "B00004Z4WR", "0767824954", "B000BUNZY2", "B00008G8LY", "B00317LM8S", "B00111YM56", "B00003CXKA", "B00600SOXE", "B00005JMXX", "B00AEFY6PQ", "B00005JMZK", "6304806434", "B0045HCJ0S", "B00BTYOYG2", "B000AM4P9K", "B004W7D1G2", "B00AEFYV9W", "B002ZG98KK", "B0001FR3IQ", "B00009WVSL", "B0057RCFQS", "B004EPZ08O", "B00003CXO1", "B000CSUNLG", "B003PIUINS", "B001ECDVKE", "B00111YM5Q", "B00IS6WQ5K", "B0021L8UXA", "B00003CXUP"], "bought_together": ["B00008WFU5", "B00008WFU4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0767802497", "B00008WFU4", "B008DL4LQ2", "B00004TDTO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 122500}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.55, "brand": "JACKSON,SAMUEL L.", "asin": "B00002E233", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71TDBGEC1NL._SY300_.gif", "title": "Deep Blue Sea"}

{"description": "To callPearl Harbora throwback to old-time war movies is something of an understatement. Director Michael Bay's epic take on the bombing that brought the United States into World War II hijacks every war movie situation and clich&#xE9; (some affectionate, some stale) you've ever seen and gives them a shiny, glossy spin until the whole movie practically gleams. Planes glisten, water sparkles, trees beckon--and Bay's re-creation of the bombing itself, a 30-minute sequence that's tightly choreographed and amazingly photographed, sets the action movie bar up quite a few notches. And in updating the classic war film, Bay and screenwriter Randall Wallace (Braveheart) use that old plot standby, the love triangle--this time, it's between two pilots (Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett) and a nurse (Kate Beckinsale) who find themselves stationed at Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, during what they thought would be a nice, sunny tour of duty. Then, of course, history intervened.For the first 90 minutes of the movie, Affleck and Beckinsale find a nice, appealing chemistry that plays on his strengths as a movie star and hers as a serious actress--he gives her glamour, she gives him smarts. Their truncated romance--the beginning of which is told in flashback so we can get right to the point where he has to leave her to go to England--works, thanks to their charm. They're no Kate and Leo fromTitanic(a strategy the film strives hard toward), but they're pretty darn adorable in their own right. Hartnett, as the not entirely unwelcome third wheel, squints bravely but makes only a slight dent in the film. Everyone else inPearl Harbor--from Cuba Gooding Jr.'s brave navy seaman to Jon Voight's able impersonation of FDR--is pretty much a glorified walk-on, taking a backseat to the pyrotechnics and action sequences that keep the three-hour film in fairly constant motion. But when that action does take hold,Pearl Harboris quite a thrilling ride.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792151712", "B000059HGY", "B00000K3AN", "B00AEBBA36", "0792133153", "079212569X", "6305169187", "6301734734", "0792147618", "0792116887", "6304618344", "079213690X", "6303269834", "6304925131", "6305718792", "6304259131", "B00004WIDB", "6304935811", "6303057225", "6304143184", "6302250269"], "bought_together": ["B00000K3AN", "B00AEBBA36"], "also_viewed": ["B00000G3PA", "0792151712", "6300213668", "B00000JS61", "6303215734", "6303402348", "B00004WIDB", "079213690X", "6305750750", "B004751DFU", "B00005O893", "B00000K3AN", "6301792734", "B00E5I2MCM", "6305169187", "B00007LVCM", "B007SPPANM", "B00L4K3MLE", "B00FLML7HW", "B008QZ5PY2", "B00JBGWP3Y"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 234413}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.49, "brand": "", "asin": "B00003CXTF", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HC1ZDJN6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]"}

{"description": "The second theatrical film from the popular television show is better than the original surprise hit. Instead of delving into their rich fantasy life, the Rugrats gang goes on a real adventure when their families visit Paris together. Mr. Pickles is brought over to fix his giant Reptar robot, the centerpiece of EuroReptarland (a biting version of the trouble-plagued EuroDisney). The underlying story has Chuckie (the one with the square glasses) looking for a new mommy, as his dad (who has a square personality) starts to fall for a villainous executive (voiced by Susan Sarandon). Soon Paris takes it on the chin as the diaper gang tries to save Chuckie's dad from the altar. The success of the Rugrats is in the writing, where much thought goes into finding comic gems for the adults (there are wonderful parodies ofThe GodfatherandKing Kongthat will sail over kids' heads). The garble-mouthed youngsters keep up their joyful ways in this 78-minute feature that feels no different from their Nickelodeon series except in length, some 3-D animation sequences, and an eclectic song score (with Cyndi Lauper's \"I Want a Mom That Will Last Forever\" the real catch).

{"description": "Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea20,000 Leagues Under  the Seagets a dose ofOn the Beachin Irwin Allen's visually  impressive but scientifically sillyVoyage to the Bottom of the Sea.  While theSeaview, the world's most advanced experimental submarine,  maneuvers under the North Pole, the Van Allen radiation belt catches fire,  giving the concept \"global warming\" an entirely new dimension. As the Earth  broils in temperatures approaching 170 degrees&nbsp;F, Walter Pidgeon's  maniacally driven Admiral Nelson hijacks theSeaviewand plays tag with  the world's combined naval forces on a race to the South Pacific, where he plans  to extinguish the interstellar fire with a well-placed nuclear missile. But  first he has to fight a mutinous crew, an alarmingly effective saboteur, not one  but two giant squid attacks, and a host of design flaws that nearly cripple the  mission (note to Nelson: think backup generators). Barbara Eden shimmies to  Frankie Avalon's trumpet solos in the most formfitting naval uniform you've ever  seen, fish-loving Peter Lorre plays in the shark tank, gloomy religious fanatic  Michael Ansara preaches Armageddon, and Joan Fontaine looks very uncomfortable  playing an armchair psychoanalyst. It's all pretty absurd, but Allen pumps it up  with larger-than-life spectacle and lovely miniature work.--Sean  AxmakerFantastic Voyage2001: A Space Odysseytook the world on  a mind-bending trip to outer space, butFantastic Voyageis the original  psychedelic inner-space adventure. When a brilliant scientist falls into a coma  with an inoperable blood clot in the brain, a surgical team embarks on a  top-secret journey to the center of the mind in a high-tech military submarine  shrunk to microbial dimensions. Stephen Boyd stars as a colorless commander sent  to keep an eye on things (though his eyes stay mostly on shapely medical  assistant Raquel Welch), while Donald Pleasance is suitably twitchy as the  claustrophobic medical consultant. The science is shaky at best, but the  imaginative spectacle is marvelous: scuba-diving surgeons battle white blood  cells, tap the lungs to replenish the oxygen supply, and shoot the aorta like  daredevil surfers. The film took home a well-deserved Oscar for Best Visual  Effects. Director Richard Fleischer, who turned Disney's 195420,000 Leagues  Under the Seainto one of the most riveting submarine adventures of all  time, creates a picture so taut with cold-war tensions and cloak-and-dagger  secrecy that niggling scientific contradictions (such as, how do miniaturized  humans breathe full-sized air molecules?) seem moot.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00007JMD8", "B000SAGGL4", "B00006JDRG", "B00005JKU0", "B00008438U", "B0045HCJSA", "B00018D3ZA", "B0007R4T1W", "B0001I55XI", "B00AEBB8VK", "B000AQKU72", "B000BZISS0", "B0007R4T26", "B0001I55SS", "B00005JKFR", "B002945DU2", "B000063UR0", "6305761078", "B000FFJ87Q", "B000HEWEDK", "6305869367", "B00AEBB94G", "B00HFWETIK", "B000067J17", "B001DB6J50", "B0044XV7AQ", "0767810864", "B00005Y6XR", "B000RXVNDI", "B00347AIN0", "B0007R4SZY", "B00B2M7DKA", "B000GUJZ0U", "B00000IREA", "B0045HCJKS", "B000BMY2KG", "B000E1BXFG", "B000063UR1", "B001MT7ZJC", "B00009NHBC", "B0001CNRLQ", "B001AR0D40", "B000BOH8Z0", "B003J216K4", "B00480OC0C", "B000FVQLKW", "6305944288", "B0002NRRRY", "B0001US8F8", "B0002NRRQU", "B0024LIBDQ", "B000062XE5", "B000TLTCTK", "B00005NSXY", "B0066E6O7C", "B00D9EJFZA", "B00AFEYS9A", "B00005R1O7", "B000I8OM94", "B00001TZ6Q", "B002VA5A02", "0767847431", "B000FOPPEC", "0783240961", "B000056NWI", "B000AYELJ2", "B002TSAAS8", "B0044O1Q60", "B0013LL2Z2", "B000A2WJBQ", "B0006B2A42", "B000QGEB1W", "B0001CNRNE", "B000O599YY", "B00014NEX0", "B0016LFG2O", "B000EHQTZO", "B00J0IN6Z4", "B000P0J0BU", "B007Y1NNAW", "B0000648ZQ", "B002CWKU18", "B008M4C1DU", "B004S8UTII", "B00023BKMC", "B002NZK5WS", "B001BN4WI6", "B001PO55LE", "B000O78KWE", "B0002XVQNK", "B00AMSM9CW", "B00B2M7ENG", "B000035Z3K", "B0001CNRLG", "630542845X", "B00E5G03I4", "B0002IQKAY", "0767812166"], "bought_together": ["B00007JMD8", "B0045HCJSA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000O78KWE", "B000O78KY2", "B00005JKU0", "B00007JMD8"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 93508}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 17.75, "brand": "", "asin": "B00004VVOH", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51W14M5006L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea / Fantastic Voyage"}
{"description": "Timecodedivides the screen into four parts and follows, in four uninterrupted shots, a series of overlapping stories. There's the wife (Saffron Burrows) of a movie producer (Stellan Skarsk&aring;rd) who's  considering leaving him; the producer is having an affair with an aspiring  actress (Salma Hayek); and the actress is the lover of a wealthy woman (Jeanne Tripplehorn), who jealously plants a bug in the actress's purse when the actress pretends to go to an audition. Meanwhile, the producer's partners and employees (Holly Hunter, Xander Berkeley, Steven Weber, and others) are trying to cope with the producer's increasing instability. There's a  drug-dealing security guard; a dim massage therapist; a temperamental director who can't find the right actress; and assorted other Hollywood types who float in and out of the action. Earthquakes and aftershocks shake things up, a lot of cocaine is snorted, and there's some sex and some violence, all improvised by the actors around a story set up by the director, Mike Figgis (Leaving Las Vegas).The emotional effect of any story is muted by the constant distraction of trying to take in four screens at once, though at times the stories resonate off each other nicely. It's an interesting experiment, made possible by the portability and longer takes of digital cameras; anyone interested in how digital technology has affected filmmaking will want to see this novel film.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00GPPXNIK", "0780625277", "B00006G8IO", "B006OB3K56", "B0000ZMGWK", "B00003JRAV", "0792845455", "B0000640VJ", "B0006J28KK", "B00005NKSL", "B0009KA7A4", "B000068MAL", "B006MGWBWQ", "B001WLMOM8"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 117580}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.25, "brand": "", "asin": "B00004W22E", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51B5B5NTJ2L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Timecode"}
{"description": "Adam Simon (Carnosaur) made his directoral debut with this  mind game of a movie. Based on a decades-old screenplay by formerTwilight Zonecontributor Charles Beaumont, Simon dusted off and  updated the script about an experimental brain researcher (Bill Pullman)  who agrees to dig into the gray matter of a schizophrenic scientist (Bud  Cort), only to fall prey to his patient's psychosis. Or maybe he's just  plain nuts. Spiced with a bizarre sense of humor (Pullman wrestles over a  brain specimen in a jar with a homeless man who tries to grab it: \"That's my  brain!\"), Pullman's ordeal takes one hairpin turn after another as he  becomes lost in a maze of alternate realities, no longer able to sort  fantasy from reality or paranoia from persecution. This clever puzzle of a film  overcomes low-budget restrictions with a deviously inventive story that echoesBraziland quotes fromThe Manchurian CandidateandNorth by  Northwest. Bill Paxton costars as a smarmy corporate manipulator with  slicked back hair and a get-rich-quick scheme for a chain of brain surgery  boutiques (\"The New You, by Eunice!\"), and George Kennedy is his bottom-line  boss. Director Simon may be most famous for playing himself in a jokey cameo in  Robert Altman'sThe Player.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00JJOY4RI", "B00004Z1GI", "B00JJOY47I", "B00HRUQB8Q", "B00GHH9IIA", "B00DOZNGTK", "B001MEJY8W", "B00KDU8HQQ", "B003L1YESE", "B00EALTVAA", "B00CPTUNZG", "B001B187L6", "B00GJ7CUFG", "B00E5S2HGS", "B0007WQHI0", "B000F3UA8E", "B00EL6ACBQ", "B00A429Y9M", "B004VQRCJG", "B00ESZZOOK", "B000TZJCN2", "B005OT7ZWI", "B00EU8RCO0", "B005ZHBEPI", "157362408X", "B003ZGJM96", "B000099T3M", "B00H7BJ0C4", "B000EOTTYK", "B00B04NJE4", "B00023P4UQ", "B000094J72", "B00BTYPW7C", "B0000694WH", "B0053TWW9K", "B00A429Y56", "B0079ZWTOO", "B003VJTGNE", "B001G9CNI6", "B00C3KTFVU", "B00005JLEY", "B001B8XRT6", "B009INAJ6A", "B005CVFZ66", "B000S0GYRU", "B00DZP1C8Q", "B001152TL6", "B00C7E3EDW", "B00EU8RC1S", "B00CPTUNUG", "B005GPFZEK", "B004SLIS7E", "B00BHMCRFG", "B0053TWVWI", "B002EOVXBK", "B008VBSR7S", "B00AJXO5X6", "B0055CP9TU", "B002P8LKCM", "B0072GPQ8G", "B009INAF9Q", "B000QQJ3Q0", "B000069I05", "B00005KH30", "0783227434", "B000FFJZO2", "B00DZP1C9K", "B0001I55U6", "B000RTB0R6", "B00030AZEI", "B00008IAKP", "B000VSOZS4", "B00004TJL5", "B000059H8V", "B0001I2BZS"], "bought_together": ["B00004Z1GI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["157362408X", "B008CYDD7I", "B00004Z1GI", "B0002C9DK4"]}, "price": 12.98, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 404704}, "asin": "B00004WG8V", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51PC0KY68DL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Brain Dead"}

{"description": "To hear the opening beats of Jan Hammer's percussive, propulsiveMiami Vicetheme is to be instantly transported back to 1984. But this groundbreaking series, with its cinematic sensibility, cool clothes, and killer soundtrack is no mere blast from the past. It still rocks. This three-disc set would be worthless if it didn't. Music was an integral part ofMiami Vice's hip vibe. The soundtrack propelled the stories and established the mood like no series before it. So the first thing you want to know is: Have the music rights been secured for this DVD release? In the pilot episode, does Phil Collins's \"In the Air Tonight\" still play ominously as vice undercover cops Crockett and Tubbs speed toward a bust? Does Eric Clapton's \"Wonderful Tonight\" serenade Sonny and Gina on his boat in the episode \"One-Eyed Jack?\" And what would the benchmark episode, \"Smuggler's Blues\" be without Glenn Frey's instant classic? From the Rolling Stones on a boombox to Elvis Presley singing \"Rubberneckin'\" on a TV,Vice's cutting-edge soundtrack has been preserved and honed in 5.1 surround sound glory.Miami Vicemade stars out of Don Johnson, Philip Michael Thomas, and Edward James Olmos, who won an Emmy as the intense, taciturn Lt. Castillo (watching him bust some martial arts moves in \"Golden Triangle\" is like Yoda cutting lose inAttack of the Clones), but the first season also offers time-capsule glimpses of actors on the cusp of stardom, including a pre-L.A. LawJimmy Smits in the pilot, a pre-Crime StoryDennis Farina in \"One-Eyed Jack,\" and a pre-MoonlightingBruce Willis in \"No Exit.\"Miami Viceput a neon sheen on cop-show convention. Its fashion sense (pastel suits, no belt, no socks), and the brilliantly employed freeze frames are still arresting.Miami Vicewas a TV watershed, and this DVD set does it full justice.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000BKVKSA", "B000MLWQ6S", "B000MLWQ6I", "B000OVLMKC", "B001BN4WK4", "B000002O4W", "B001MVWLYY", "B001G0MFQ0", "B00005JMHI", "B000FVBLBQ", "B000BGR1B4", "B004UV3KSO", "B000002O54", "B000LXGXY8", "B000BF0C8E", "B000LE16VC", "B00DYQ1G78", "B0007LXP86", "B000J4QWMC", "B00018D3RI", "B001JFKWE4", "B00005JNHT", "B000XJD3K2", "B000E5KQMI", "B001B7CNXI", "B005FQ2HBO", "B000N2HD6O", "B000GW8UAE", "B0009ZE9Y4", "B000HXDWG4", "B003XMKU3Y", "B00066FBQQ", "B000O77SNG", "B0024FAD7Y", "B000ASDFIG", "B000LV6VZQ", "B000SNUR34", "B000006V32", "B0030Y12AK", "0790742020", "B00023GGAI", "B001J0FVYK", "B000PGTPC8", "B0007LXP7W", "B0007A0F4Y", "B000G75ARU", "B000HWZ4HU", "B00HZMZ286", "B002WQ79A4", "B000N4RAQA", "B002LFQIL2", "B004MLEYV4", "B000ERVJKO", "B0007YMWFK", "B003QS0E54", "B00096S45S", "B000TZX5XK", "B0030VANIU", "B00I87U8UE", "B001JAHQGG", "B00008ZL4Q", "B0006UEVTK", "B00020H9NO", "B0006IUDXA", "B007KW5M6I", "B0002NY8R6", "B00I87U9H6", "B0000DFZ5O", "B00113ALL8", "B000ATQYWY", "B001DHXT7U", "B000E5KQLY", "B000059H7O", "B002SPV1X0", "B0007PALZW", "B00CQAVIZS", "B00005JO3P", "B00008WJEZ", "B001CQONOA", "B0047BXR9E", "B0012EBV8I", "B000LE16Y4", "B0047BXR8U", "B002UJIY34", "B000T28PU6", "B000GRU09I", "B0006Q93BU", "B00BTFK01Y", "B0012KSUT0", "B0014FAIXE", "B000M9BPGC", "B000E5KQM8", "B00005U5A8", "B000BUE5CI", "B000CELOV8", "B0019GNX4O", "B001UDPA9C", "B000YENUOK", "B007AAF3FK", "B000WQWPSM"], "bought_together": ["B000BKVKSA", "B000MLWQ6S"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000BKVKSA", "B000MLWQ6S", "B000MLWQ6I", "B00ID3TPA2"]}, "price": 34.88, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 15590}, "asin": "B00005JLEY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/512GQ253P3L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Miami Vice: Season 1"}

{"description": "WithThe Return of the King, the greatest fantasy epic in film history draws to a grand and glorious conclusion. Director Peter Jackson's awe-inspiring adaptation of the Tolkien classicThe Lord of the Ringscould never fully satisfy those who remain exclusively loyal to Tolkien's expansive literature, but as a showcase for physical and technical craftsmanship it is unsurpassed in pure scale and ambition, setting milestone after cinematic milestone as the brave yet charmingly innocent Hobbit Frodo (Elijah Wood) continues his mission to Mordor, where he is destined to destroy the soul-corrupting One Ring of Power in the molten lava of Mount Doom. While the heir to the kingdom of Men, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), endures the massive battle at Minas Tirith with the allegiance of the elf Legolas (Orlando Bloom), dwarf Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) and the great wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen), Frodo and stalwart companion Samwise Gamgee (Sean Astin) must survive the schizoid deceptions of Gollum, who remains utterly convincing as a hybrid of performance (by Andy Serkis) and subtly nuanced computer animation.Jackson and cowriters Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens have much ground to cover; that they do so with intense pacing and epic sweep is impressive enough, but by investing greater depth and consequence in the actions of fellow Hobbits Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd), they ensure thatReturn of the Kingmaintains the trilogy's emphasis on intimate fellowship. While several major characters appear only briefly, and one (Christopher Lee's evil wizard, Saruman) relegated entirely to the extended version on DVD, Jackson is to be commended for his editorial acumen; like Legolas the archer, his aim as a filmmaker is consistently true, and he remains faithful to Tolkien's overall vision. IfReturnsuffers from too many endings, as some critic suggested, it's only because the epic's conclusion is so loyally inclusive of the actors--most notably Astin--who gave it such strength to begin with. By ending theLOTRtrilogy with noble integrity and faith in the power of imaginative storytelling,The Return of the King, like its predecessors, will stand as an adventure for the ages.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JKZV", "B00003CWT6", "B00BEZTMFY", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B002ZG980U", "B002PMV9FG", "B008UZA8FY", "B001NGML48", "B00005JM5E", "B001GZ6QC4", "B005COPWZW", "B008M4C1EO", "B00HFFE8HE", "039548930X", "B000W7F5SS", "B000I0RQVI", "B002VWNIDG", "B000E6EK2Y", "B001BYMX4A", "B004M1A21K", "B007K3JFUQ", "B001DHXT20", "B001UV4XHY", "0345325818", "B003Y5H54W", "B00005JNJV", "B00E5I2M6I", "B000A3XY5A", "B004LWZWGA", "B000U7WV1Y", "B005LXQLRW", "B001OQCV6A", "B000E8M0VA", "B004SIP8ZM", "B000EHRVMY", "0618640150", "B003ZK99NQ", "B0013FDM7E", "B00005JPH2", "B000UNYK4E", "B009JBWOU0", "B00003CX5P", "B00008G8M5", "B00GKOJ98E", "B004LWZW42", "B000H30B2C", "B000P0J0C4", "B00CZDLGDU", "B000M341QE", "B00008G8M4", "B000FKO5QK", "B00HWWUQYY", "B007SPPANM", "B008JFUO72", "B001DJLD1M", "0345538374", "B00AEFY5B6", "B00005JKCH", "B004SIP9U6", "B000YGGNMO", "B00E5I2M9K", "0618126988", "B005OCFGTO", "B00E8S2JZ4", "6305313687", "B004AKCME8", "B0002KVUKM", "B000AARKOO", "B0006GAO5Y", "B000K7VHQ4", "B002ZG997C", "B00AHTYI5M", "B008JFUS0U", "B0042MEQVG", "B00275EGWY", "B00E9PMML2", "B008UZDXEW", "B004SIP7F8", "B00116GEJS", "B00003CXI1", "B003ZKBELG", "B003Y5H5EW", "B000V4UFZK", "B0007PLLBU", "B001DTPZNY", "B002O3Z50Q", "B001GCUO1Q", "B000LP6KNU", "B005G4TJUC", "B00AW0KHTM", "B002ZG97YM", "054792819X", "B00AEFXZJE", "B0000YEEGM", "B002IPFWTE", "B001ECQ75A", "B000065U1N", "B0051MKNV8", "B000W796OM", "B00J49R1BY"], "bought_together": ["B00005JKZV", "B00003CWT6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00HFFE8HE", "B00003CWT6", "B00005JKZV", "B00BEZTMFY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 1589}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.49, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00005JKZY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HS7iSFv5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)"}
{"description": "As the second season aired, the decline in TV ratings and the tepid  sales ofKelly Osbourne's albumindicated that the Osbourne family's 15 minutes were just about up. But this  two-disc set is an indispensable time-capsule keepsake of that brief and shining  moment when Ozzy and his family put their indelible stamp on pop culture as the  stars of the first reality sitcom. For addledheavy-metal pioneer  Ozzy, his fiercely devoted wife and manager Sharon, and two (of three) of  their children--petulant misfit Jack and the more flamboyant pink-haired  Kelly--it was a very good year. They were MTV's top-rated series ever. They graced  magazine covers. They were championed by no less a moral arbiter than Dan  Quayle. Even President George W. Bush got into the act, toasting Ozzy at the  annual Washington Press Club soiree: \"Ozzy, mom loves your stuff.\"The  Osbournesis the kind of series for which the phrase \"instantly addictive\"  was coined. The idea seemed positively batty: Chronicle the lives of the  Osbournes as they settle in to their new Beverly Hills home. They ain't the  Clampetts, as the crates marked \"Dead Things\" indicates. Persistent use of theFword and other obscenities (not bleeped on the uncensored DVD) aside,  the Osbournes at heart are a close-knit, loving family. Or, as Ozzy so tenderly  puts it, \"I love you more than life itself, but you're all f------ mad.\" Episode  4 bears him out, as Sharon and Jack declare war on their noisy next-door  neighbors with airborne foodstuffs. These 10 endlessly repeatable episodes are  enhanced by this features-heavy DVD; among its most inspired extras is an \"Ozzy  translator.\" The first season ofThe Osbourneswas a lightning-in-a- bottle phenomenon whose success has yet to be duplicated, not by the shameless  Anna Nicole, not by clueless Liza, not even by the Osbournes themselves.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000A2ZSN", "B0001I55LU", "B0000CBXZ7", "B000X7HFA8", "B005DJ62NM", "B00013RC34", "B000H5U5U8", "B00062IDZQ", "B0002PYS5Q", "B0002V7OJC", "B0008KLV8M", "B000CNE0RY", "144021400X", "B000BDH6AI", "B000NNK4DW", "B000FKO3HQ", "B000ICLRL6", "B000VWQTVG", "B0085KGGLY", "B0016QNSBU", "B000WTVZIK", "B000068TOX", "B0013D8M0I", "B00AF3OEJ0", "B000BITUY8", "B00561BN1S", "B00561BNAE", "B000HT3862", "B00769RH0O", "B000OHZKYU", "B000A88F22", "B00004YRI4", "B000063DFS", "B0007KIFXW", "0446569909", "0446569895", "B0002V7OJM", "B000GG4Y0U", "B00006F89V", "B000GG4Y1O", "B000KJU1MS", "B000S2XD36", "B0040LAH80", "B003JMJ5T8", "B000002B3Q", "B000002KET", "B00008NV4M", "B009M4KT8I", "B005ZEM91Y", "B005DJ62NC", "1906002371", "B000JMKKFY", "B000AA304S", "B00BTHWFBK", "B0035G5IQM", "B000002KB8", "B000FEBWTE", "B00FKIB3XA", "B001CY5N1E", "B0071BY2CS", "B002MJV7JA", "0743466209", "B0082JR26Q", "B005FIXA90", "B000SQFBZ0", "B0001XAODE", "B00005JLZN", "B000002KDO", "B000B5XOWU", "B000KLQUMQ", "B000I0RNVQ", "B000002KGG", "B00004W4UD", "B000AM4P9K", "B000FSME2Y", "B00BUWD7E8", "B000SULWKO", "B007CO5E30", "B003NKU9XM"], "bought_together": ["B0000A2ZSN", "B0001I55LU"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0077LRGKW", "B0001I55LU", "B0000A2ZSN", "B000CNE0RY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 142228}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 28.99, "brand": "Lions Gate", "asin": "B00005JLBW", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Qym1VF47L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Osbournes: Season 1 (Uncensored)"}

{"description": "With its disturbing images and a few good shocks,The Ringis the kind of frightfest you'll watch to set a chilling mood or spook your susceptible friends, but when you try to sort it out, this well-mounted American remake (of the 1998 Japanese hitRingu, based on Koji Suzuki's popular novel) becomes a batch of incoherent parts. The negligible plot follows a Seattle reporter (Naomi Watts) as she investigates the death of her niece, the victim of a mysterious videotape that, according to urban legend, causes the viewer's death seven days later. (Fear Dot Comborrowed the same idea while avoiding this film's lofty pretensions.) The countdown structure follows the reporter, her son, and her estranged boyfriend into deepening layers of terror--all quite effective until the movie attempts to explain itself. At that you're better off shutting down your brain and letting the creepy visuals take over.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0009X763M", "B0006SGYL0", "B004SIP92O", "B00001QGUM", "B00151QYOO", "B001P3SA9Y", "B009XTF8KQ", "B004LWZW24", "B00004BZIY", "B0021L8UFI", "B001JNNDJM", "B000V4UFZK", "B000PMLJMQ", "B0021L8UPS", "B000TJ6PBK", "B0019X3YX2", "B00005RHGK", "B00BEIYMAG", "B0026LQM2Q", "B00005JNJR", "B003UGLCIA", "B000IHY9TS", "B002VWNIDG", "B00AIBZLVY", "B00AEBBA2W", "B00006FDCD", "B008JFUNYG", "B00EZ50SGW", "B00B96TGQS", "B00005JL3T", "B000BTJDGC", "B00AJLHUA8", "B000OVLBGM", "B000RIWAVW", "B003VA3JUO", "B00DW5IM14", "B00005JNY3", "B0021L8UXA", "B00008LUNW", "B000F6IOAM", "B001D2WU9I", "B002JT69IW", "B000AA4JL6", "B00174RCHW", "B00AQJ8MLY", "B00386EZUY", "B0000VCZMK", "B00018D42W", "B0000E2R6P", "B0006SSOHC", "B001U0HBQA", "B00004TS0G", "B003L20IEW", "B008F283VS", "B001DJLD1W", "B0053TWVDC", "B00007G1ZB", "B0015ET3YO", "B00011CZRE", "B004LWZW2O", "B002ZG971U", "B000088NQR", "B002LMSWN2", "B00AEFXSLE", "B0000648X0", "B00005JOWW", "B00005JNNT", "B0031U8OEK", "B006CXIKYC", "B001MVYUR0", "B004SIP9P6", "B003UN0752", "B001NPD9LS", "B008WAM2E2", "B001B1UO6W", "B000GBEWRU", "B00AZTUUQK", "B0002DB54A", "B004SIP9O2", "0780631684", "B003LR5BD0", "B000GCFO0I", "B000VKL6Z2", "B005CFBYW6", "B008G33PIM", "B000GSYRY6", "B0010X73ZG", "B000AM4P9K", "B000A5045Q", "B000056T5E", "B005TK23PQ", "B004BLJQOK", "0783116926", "B001DZOC6Y", "B00BEIYG98", "B005LAIGOQ", "B0097C046W", "B0013FDM7E", "B00BEIYGT8", "B0001FR3IQ"], "bought_together": ["B0009X763M", "B0006SGYL0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004LWZW24", "B000V4UFZK", "B00BEIYMAG", "B00005JNY3"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 99771}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.79, "brand": "Dreamworks Skg", "asin": "B00005JLTK", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51MKWPKHSTL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Ring (Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "James Bond DVDs have in general been pretty loaded, butDie Another Dayraises the bar with a two-disc set featuring dynamic DTS 6.1 ES and Dolby Digital 5.1 EX sound that makes good use of the rear speakers. The first commentary track is by Pierce Brosnan and Rosamund Pike (who plays villain Miranda Frost). They weren't together at the time, so their comments are spliced into one track. Brosnan has a good time watching and is proud of the film but also doesn't take himself too seriously (\"They don't teach you this stuff at drama school: 'OK, now you're going to be electrocuted by the bad guy.'\"). Self-proclaimed \"Bond novice\" Pike also is proud of the film and says she's annoyed by people who question whether there's still a need for Bond. On the second commentary track, director Lee Tamahori and producer Michael G. Wilson chat about topics as diverse as casting, Bond lore, and product placements. For more Bond lore, don't overlook the trivia track, which offers pop-up tidbits about the filming and tips on the inside jokes.The centerpiece of the second disc is the 80-minute \"InsideDie Another Day\" documentary, which is a set of featurettes strung together. Topics include the opening surfing sequence; the scenes set in North Korea and Cuba (including Halle Berry's bikini tribute to Ursula Andress); the ice palace; post-production elements such as computer graphics, editing, and music; the car battle (finding strong ice was the key safety issue); and the passing of the \"Q\" torch from Desmond Llewellyn to John Cleese.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000NIBURQ", "B000M53GM2", "B000RPCK1U", "B000NDEXPM", "B000M53GMW", "B000RPCK1K", "B000RPCK24", "B000NIBURG", "B000M53GLS", "B000RPCK1A", "B000NIBUR6", "B000M53GN6", "B001PPLIEG", "B001R10BN2", "B00AQSN7HE", "B000RPCK0Q", "B000M53GNG", "B000NIBUS0", "B000NDEXPC", "B00004RG62", "B000M53GMC", "B007REV4T8", "B00004WEJZ", "B00005JL0I", "B009PN18R2", "B008YAPQX4", "B004BR7XLM", "B009PN3OD8", "B003QO8TOQ", "B000HRMAPE", "B000VNMMR0", "B0000BYRO7", "B00AZFECL8", "B000EGDB10", "B004EPYZUS", "B0004Z33EQ", "B00AIBZMD6", "B009A87Z6U", "B009RO9LKK", "B000SK5Z70", "B00003CXMV", "6305657947", "B00005JLYW", "B00005JN2Z", "B00023B1LC", "B005PTYP70", "B00008G8M4", "B00005JNJV", "B00000G3PA", "B000P0J06K", "B002UZCJ8Y", "B002ZG9864", "0792844068", "B00005JKIP", "0792166736", "0790732238", "B00AS1Q93S", "B003Q6D2B4", "B0002I84N0", "B000U1ZV8K", "B008JFURII", "B00JA3RVG4", "B000MZHW40", "B00026ZG10", "0790732149", "B000FKO3HG", "B000AP04FG", "B008JFUS0U", "B0001FGC1U", "B00005JMQW", "B009L6UDUG", "B00AVWIQZS", "B0013BM63O", "B00005JLRT", "B00E5I2M6I", "B001TK80C0", "B00AZMFJYA", "B0007KZQAM", "B002ZG999U", "B00BUAEYVK", "B009A87ZQU", "B000P0J06U", "B008JFUO72", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B00003CY0V", "B00E5I2MCM", "B0036TGSR6", "B003AWRMBU", "B0000BYRO9", "B008JFUNHI", "B00177YA1K", "6304696221", "B0021L8V0M", "B00006G8FD", "B000UR9T8C", "B002GNOSFM", "B003UESJFQ", "B0006L0LOS", "B000AYELVU"], "bought_together": ["B000NIBURQ", "B000M53GM2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000M53GM2", "B000RPCK1U", "B000M53GN6", "B000RPCK0Q"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 38500}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.0, "brand": "MGM", "asin": "B00005JLBE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51kgPWMuVFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Die Another Day (Widescreen Special Edition)"}

Academy Award nominee Moore \"is a vision,\" declared Rex Reed, and he called Quaid's performance \"the best of his career,\" in this stunning drama hailed by the New York Post as \"one of the year's best.\"", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000DZIGEO", "B00005BH23", "B00AEFY8MM", "B002VECLVO", "B000092T3P", "B004XVMCKS", "B0000640VK", "B003L20ICE", "0767847415", "B000NIVJFY", "B00J2PQYG8", "B000053VB1", "B00KMULA6Q", "B00KGLS050", "B004SIP71M", "B00FBDJE8K", "B0016Q2D66", "B0037QGS0A", "B00KLF5JHS", "B000EBD9TO", "B000BYRCQU", "1878271970", "B00008RV1F", "B00996RSYM", "B00G4Q3KOC", "B00000K31T", "B00J2T18MY", "B00005JLRE", "B001CQONPE", "B00005BCK0", "B000N3SU92", "B001F0TM4Y", "B00HZVX14O", "B004SIP84S", "B00A144O20", "B002VECLVY", "B00005JLR8", "B00AEFXESQ", "B004U7MR4G", "B00HHYF5EI", "B001PPLJIQ", "B004SIP73U", "B00I0CAVXG", "B00GUO2SKA", "B00H91LVTM", "B00D2CYU2W", "B00E849QSG", "B00JK5C46E", "B000F7CEC0", "B000CNESTE", "B00GWWV1XU", "B00JDCORSC", "B006FYYWQS", "0800141806", "B000ZM1MG4", "B0013D8L7C", "B0002B15WO", "B00AEBB89C", "B002D755A8", "B004U7MR1Y", "B0000714BT", "B000093NQY", "B00005JMU1", "B00004TX2E", "B0014GI6I2", "B00G7QPXUI", "B00000F5B5", "B00IS6WQ8W", "B0009I8QHC", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B0007PALGG", "B00JHH21TU", "B001DJ7PSC", "B002VWNICC", "B008NNSD78", "B0006IIKQW", "B001KP2J6W", "B00005JOFQ", "B00GO4RGWQ", "B00003CWTI", "B004499LWG", "B00606P0BM", "B000FVQM2Y", "6305327068", "B00007L4KF", "B00GR33LAK", "B000EQHXNW", "B000TXNDV6", "B009NYF2GQ", "B000FTJ74Q", "B00023P4N8", "B003498SCQ", "B0002KPIQY", "B000CNESU8", "0792833198", "B000PAAJZ6", "B000CNE08S", "B004YCKKFK", "B00005V5NU"], "bought_together": ["B000DZIGEO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000DZIGEO", "B00J2PQYG8", "0790740044", "B00005BH23"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 32216}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.25, "brand": "Universal Studios", "asin": "B00005JLQH", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516WKSMQRWL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Far from Heaven"}
{"description": "Outstanding picture and sound plus tons of features makeCharlie's Angels: Full Throttlea fully loaded DVD.  Don't expect more T&A; in the unrated edition, however.  The only difference is glimpses of more intense violence in a few of the fight scenes.  For example, in the theatrical version you'll see an angel flying through the air, but in the unrated version you'll then see her lying expressionless on the ground.  Also, blood flies out of Drew Barrymore's mouth in one scene.  On his commentary track, director McG discusses inside jokes, visual effects, and shots that didn't quite work for him.  Like a TV sportscaster, he uses a telestrator, but only to occasionally circle items of interest or draw arrows.  There's also an amusing commentary track by the three writers, who chuckle over inside jokes and discuss how the film was changed from the original script.  They preface their comments with: \"I guess they asked us to do this just to prove that writers worked on this movie.\"  \"Who are we kidding?  Who's listening to this right now?\"If you want still more info, there's a trivia track with pop-up factoids with occasional links to more featurettes, a jukebox that offers clips of 11 songs and explanations of why they were picked, a cameo-graphy that offers clips of 13 personalities and why we should know them, and eight 4- to 18-minute featurettes exploring such topics as stunts, vehicles, costumes, and the Pussycat Dolls dance troupe.  And in the next evolution of product placement, the DVD-ROM \"Shop the Scene\" feature allows you to search for a character's outfit or gadget then buy it online.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002A5EBMQ", "B00164EAGY", "B00003CXZ1", "B00AEFYGBA", "B000069HYG", "B0000SX9N2", "B00005JL8Z", "B00004ZDO9", "B008H6GHII", "B000UDGOC0", "B007AFC0RY", "B0006L0LOS", "B000085EFK", "B0007P0Y7C", "B00003CXMP", "B00024JC4E", "B00016MSV2", "B0007PLLBU", "B001C5LLQ4", "B00005MEVO", "B000BKJ758", "B000MX7V70", "B000035Z3G", "B002GHHHL0", "B000LC3ICE", "B000FDFSH2", "B0006GANPA", "B000Y11BC6", "B000AP04FG", "B00026ZG10", "B0041KKYGU", "B00005JMUA", "0767819640", "B0018PH3KQ", "B00008G7UI", "B00BLN4V0A", "B002GOAH1A", "B00006HAWN", "B0001BS3IE", "B0009RCPUW", "B002ZG984Q", "B001EDVNNU", "B000VI70QS", "B004LWZW2O", "B000A343RI", "B0006FO8E8", "B000EGDB10", "B000RW3VCU", "B00005JN4H", "B00BTYMPUY", "B00005J761", "B000CEXGAU", "B005TK0MFE", "B0041ONFOE", "B000VG66XS", "B00ID8H98C", "B00007AJF5", "B00AEFXO8Q", "B0009W5JR8", "B008JFURII", "B00001PE4D", "B000M7FOO8", "B004P7CN7W", "B0000DZ6N3", "B00005JM5B", "B00007GZRP", "B000ARXF96", "B0018CNNV2", "B000CCW2P2", "B0009KA2OA", "B002O3Z4ZW", "B00006G8JD", "B0008FXT1Y", "B0000524E5", "B002GSXKOW", "B00005JM55", "B003Q6D2B4", "B005CFBYW6", "B00008WJD6", "B000ENC5YW", "B003FCKI3O", "B005Z9MFRC", "B00004STVN", "B00005JG6N", "B00E1HIXEI", "B0007OCG56", "B00005JMEW", "B000BTIU4S", "B00008WJEZ", "B000NIBURQ", "B000EQ5V8G", "B0001Z37HM", "B003PIUINS", "B00005JMW7", "B00196UTEG", "B000A2IPQY", "B004SIP6VI", "B00005JLZW", "B00005JNTU", "B00AEFXCLU"], "bought_together": ["B002A5EBMQ", "B00AEFYGBA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002A5EBMQ", "B0000CABE5", "B000069HYG", "B008JFUUIA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 26650}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.9, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B00005JLYW", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51L5TYVcBmL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle (Unrated Widescreen Edition)"}

On the surface, there's nothing out of the ordinary here with the exception of a few minutes of rehearsal footage, but everything is just so darn interesting to watch. Mann and his stars dish about the making of the film, including the creation of Cruise's assassin. The nighttime shooting (shot digitally and transferred sublimely) is examined along with a single deleted scene (with a clear explanation on why it was cut). Think the climatic finale aboard a train was shot on a subway for convenience? No, Mann just wanted to control the backgrounds!

{"description": "Based on the perennial nonfiction bestseller by H.G. Bissinger,Friday Night Lightslooks at high school football in the harsh light of reality, finding heart and hardness while stirring our emotions. Actor-director Peter Berg (Very Bad Things, The Rundown) is Bissinger's cousin; he knows the material well, and understands how an obsession with winning turns high school kids into somber, over-pressured gladiators--expendable soldiers in a community war against shame and obscurity. The fact-based story focuses on the 1988 football season of Odessa-Permian high school in West Texas, and as a fast-paced sports movie, Berg delivers the goods with a rousing, frenetically styled crowd-pleaser. But there's darkness in this tale of weary underdogs, including an abusive father (well-played by country music star Tim McGraw), threatening townsfolk, an injured star running back (Derek Luke), a tormented quarterback (Lucas Black), and the melancholy coach (Billy Bob Thornton) who takes his team to the finals. Berg's film could use less flashy cutting and more drama to support its gridiron intensity, butFriday Night Lightsoffers a refreshing alternative to the conventional sports movie, and makes a perfect triple-feature with the equally exciting documentariesGo Tigers!andThe Last Game.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JPBO", "B00AEBB9UU", "B000056VP4", "B005CA4SOM", "B002NZK5QO", "B000J3OTT6", "B000EXZFCQ", "B00004W221", "6305428492", "B000KHYN9C", "0306809907", "B00AEFXOKO", "B002VECM6S", "B0001US66Y", "B001LGXIA6", "B00E1HIXFW", "B0032UYFAQ", "B004BFTFBU", "B003L77GCE", "0792843592", "B001RXDM2C", "B00B83N2NU", "B0014DO5XU", "B000RF1QE2", "B002O3Z4XY", "B000068NNU", "B00AEFYJI0", "B009YQJ2Q4", "B000A0GP0Y", "B000649YAM", "B00008EY60", "B000MNOX94", "1935618563", "B000FVR1T2", "B000GAKDAG", "B00AEFXJY0", "B009NNM9OA", "B001FB55NK", "B000ARTN3I", "630529142X", "B00002SSKG", "B00AEBB9AA", "630514415X", "0201196778", "B0060ZJ7BC", "B00553K9IA", "B00000G3PA", "B00004Z4WR", "6305313687", "B003UESJHO", "B00AEFYKWU", "0800141741", "B00028HBES", "B0002S94CK", "B0000AC8LH", "B00004RE45", "B000TZJBPQ", "B00009OWJV", "B000274T94", "B00005JLRZ", "B001G5T6GW", "B00AEBBA36", "B00004Y2R1", "B000035Z59", "B0068FZ0GK", "B000Y7WGOW", "B004KPLVX6", "B004GJYROG", "B00004TJQJ", "B003UESJ9M", "B000M4RG42", "B00AEBB86A", "B005OZVXCU", "B006X08ET0", "B00005JM10", "B00005JLG1", "B002GIBVVQ", "B00003CXTG", "B002ZG99N6", "B001FB55L2", "B00AEBBA2M", "0800177258", "B00003CXNY", "6304765258", "B000VG66XS", "B002YMWQ2M", "B000WZEZGI", "B0002J4YVK", "B0007LLPXI", "B004GJYRF0", "B000F4RH84", "B000F6ZIIS", "B000068QPY", "B002Q4VBPQ", "B002T4GWWA", "B0034G4P94", "B000NO39FG", "B000ADWDE8", "B00003GPFT", "B0000633U2"], "bought_together": ["B000056VP4", "B00005JPBO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004GXKBF6", "0306809907", "B000056VP4", "B005CA4SOM"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 7523}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.89, "brand": "Universal Studios", "asin": "B00005JNEW", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51X7RX6KY3L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Friday Night Lights (Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "Jamie Foxx's uncannily accurate performance isn't the only good thing aboutRay. Riding high on a wave of Oscar buzz, Foxx proved himself worthy of all the hype by portraying blind R&B; legend Ray Charles in a warts-and-all performance that Charles approved shortly before his death in June 2004. Despite a few dramatic embellishments of actual incidents (such as the suggestion that the accidental drowning of Charles's younger brother caused all the inner demons that Charles would battle into adulthood), the film does a remarkable job of summarizing Charles's strengths as a musical innovator and his weaknesses as a philandering heroin addict who recorded some of his best songs while flying high as a kite. Foxx seems to be channeling Charles himself, and as he did with the life of Ritchie Valens in La Bamba, director Taylor Hackford gets most of the period details absolutely right as he chronicles Ray's rise from \"chitlin circuit\" performer in the early '50s to his much-deserved elevation to legendary status as one of the all-time great musicians. Foxx expertly lip-syncs to Ray Charles' classic recordings, but you could swear he's the real deal in a film that honors Ray Charles without sanitizing his once-messy life.--Jeff ShannonMore on Ray CharlesModern Sounds in Country and Western Music(CD)The Genius of Ray Charles(CD)Ray Charles and Betty Carter--Dedicated to You(CD)Genius & Soul--The 50th Anniversary Collection(CD)Ray: A Tribute to the Movie, the Music, and the Man(book)More Albums by Ray Charles", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000E8QVWY", "B001P3SA94", "B00465I1CE", "B00005JKMQ", "6305428409", "B003BV8I3Q", "B00AEFXTKO", "B0002LE9HC", "B000BOH8X2", "B00AEFYG3S", "0790739313", "B000JJSL1W", "B000A50460", "B00005TQ44", "0783230524", "B0009R1TJ0", "0780627822", "B00AEFZ63M", "B000P0J092", "B002VWNICM", "B00EV4EUT8", "B000JLTRH2", "B000N6U0E2", "B0041QSZS8", "0783237367", "078324228X", "B00AEFY6TW", "B003HKN534", "B00BTYPWDQ", "B00G4Q3KOC", "B00007AJG1", "B00007L4KF", "B00ANDDBBY", "B000BITV9W", "0783114907", "B00007AJG2", "1558908390", "B00005JLRZ", "B000FVQLQQ", "6305692572", "0767821637", "B002CA68NO", "B00AFEXRME", "B002CPMB9O", "B004SIP93S", "B000063JDI", "B00005NB8K", "B00125WAWS", "6305505780", "B000IFRT4W", "B001TUZGPO", "B009NNM9OA", "B000RB6XG2", "B000P0J0CY", "B0001FR3IQ", "B000FVQLRA", "B00066FAVW", "B002XMGGK6", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00DW5IL2E", "B00005JPK8", "0767811070", "B000I0QL7I", "B000069I0E", "B00080ZG10", "0306814315", "B000P0J0EM", "B00AEFXP8K", "B00049QQHI", "B00000JGHV", "B0007CEXYK", "B0001Q4BOE", "B0000YEE6M", "B000NIVJF4", "B008Y1YJN6", "B00066VTU8", "B001132GNY", "B0006QAIG4", "B0034G4OSG", "B000C20VRS", "0800141741", "B00A2H9QN8", "B000Y11B8K", "B00005LB86", "B000056VP4", "B00005JL72", "B000095J01", "B000Q7ZNZ4", "B002CAWNEM", "B003UESJHO", "B00066FAQW", "0783230389", "B0013FDM7E", "B00007ELEO", "B00AMEZDJW", "B000P0J0CE", "B003Y5H4ZC", "0767821955", "B00003GPFT", "B0021L8V2A"], "bought_together": ["B000E8QVWY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0002LE9HC", "B000E8QVWY", "B000BOH8X2", "B00AZMFJYA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 17277}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.89, "brand": "Universal Studios", "asin": "B00005JND5", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41RQ8ETK19L._SX300_.jpg", "title": "Ray (Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "The simple pleasure of watching a living car squirt oil in a villain's face just never goes away. Disney, in their effort to revitalize theHerbiefranchise, has made the wise choice of not trying too hard--aside from a small bit of skateboarding action, just about every element ofHerbie: Fully Loadedwould fit right into the 1963 original (groovily titledThe Love Bug) or its various sequels. Maggie Peyton (Lindsay Lohan, the fiery-tressed starlet ofMean GirlsandFreaky Friday) wants to join her family's dynasty of race car drivers, but her father (Michael Keaton,Batman Returns) worries that she'll get hurt. Instead, as a college graduation gift, he buys her a junked-out Volkswagen Beetle--which turns out to be Herbie, a car with a mind of its own. Soon Maggie and Herbie are racing against an arrogant racing champion (Matt Dillon,Crash,There's Something About Mary) and duking it out with monster trucks, eventually hoping her father's heart will change.Herbie: Fully Loadedis formulaic fluff, but executed with cheerful enthusiasm; everyone involved has clearly embraced the mix of slapstick hijinks and light family drama. There's even a handful of cameos by NASCAR drivers. The result is every bit as ridiculous yet entertaining as its forebears.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B008H6GHEM", "B00005JMCW", "B00GGG60II", "B0007LXPBI", "B0000DZTMA", "B000096IAH", "B0007LXPBS", "B00005JN0Z", "B0000DZTM7", "B0000DZTMY", "B000FKP3XY", "B0009JE57G", "B000065V42", "B000BJ7BCK", "B00005JM9Q", "B008H6GH9W", "B0001I563M", "B008H6GHLU", "6305870179", "B003B1X85O", "B00437IEI6", "B00H9U7QA6", "B008H6GHG0", "B000B2YR92", "B0009X75QU", "B000YGGNMO", "B0001EFTH4", "0792839749", "B000055ZJP", "B00BI6SRVY", "B000JFY05W", "B0009DWL8W", "B001SXZ7T2", "B00AEFY8FO", "B001SXZ7TW", "B000089798", "B0001XAPVK", "B0007Z0NYG", "B004SIP75S", "B0017TWV0U", "B003PGNBNY", "B00795C5X4", "B000FCW15A", "B0006SSMWE", "B000HDRB8O", "B002BIULQ2", "B0001A79EO", "B0007US7CG", "6305320950", "B0007US7C6", "B000324Y98", "B001GC9VK6", "1558908404", "B002935GMS", "B00005NQGL", "B00005JN0Q", "B0000VCZKW", "B0012IWO0I", "B008H6GHHY", "B008H6GHJM", "B0074FUROI", "B008H6GH7Y", "B000WOSAYM", "B0024NSFYO", "B000BITUVG", "B00005JN0D", "B000089771", "B000OYCM5I", "B0019ESNGE", "B007R6DJP8", "B00022FWTA", "B00005JPO4", "B00009QG6G", "B00GOITWRE", "B00AEFYWQY", "B0001I55OW", "B000065V44", "B00005RRG7", "B005LAIISA", "B004HO6I4M", "B005F96UJ6", "B000P0J0CO", "B008H6GHM4", "B004GJYROG", "B003QP4DPY", "B001AR012O", "B0026RLMC0", "B0016Q2D5M", "B00006LPHB", "B004CYVZ4K"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B008H6GHEM", "B00005JMCW", "B000096IAH", "B00028HBES"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "asin": "B00005JNUY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514VE1AJGGL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Herbie Fully Loaded"}

{"description": "With the slimmest extras package for a Pixar film debuting on DVD,Carsstill shines for home viewing. As with earlier digital-to-digital transfers, the film sounds and looks stunning. There is only one behind-the-scenes feature, a 16-minute cursory but entertaining glance at director John Lasseter's influences (his dad was a car-parts manager), including some of the real-life inspiration for the film such as Michael Wallis's influential book on Route 66 (he also voiced the sheriff). There's a new cartoon for the DVD, \"Mater and Ghost Light,\" which is smile-inducing at best. Four deleted scenes (in storybook format with voices) also show a darker tone the movie may have taken at one point. Best is the adorable short \"One Man Band\" that showed theatrically with the film, and the film's credit sequence can be seen full screen without the credits (and find the Easter egg for an extended version).

{"description": "In the DVD world, the Criterion Collection label generally indicates that you'll be getting your money's worth on the extras, andThe Life Aquatic with Steve Zissouis no exception. These two discs contain many features that fans of the film will expect: Seu Jorge performing David Bowie songs (complete versions), many documentary scenes of writer-director Wes Anderson at work, interviews with cast members including Cate Blanchett, Bill Murray, etc. Other extras are a little more confusing. For instance, does Seymour Cassel, who plays Zissou's deceased partner, know what he's doing when he complains to a hairless cigar merchant about having to go faux bald? And what's the deal withMondo Monda? It's a cringingly awkward Italian talk show in which the host (also an actor in the film) interviews the screenwriters, throwing out references so random and esoteric that even smart guys like Anderson and Noah Baumbach are left speechless. It's all a joke, right? In the end, the bonus material accomplishes its primary goal: get those who already enjoy the film to like it just a little bit more.--Leah Weathersby", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0010X8NF0", "6305428239", "B0000640VJ", "0767821408", "B007L6VR12", "B001QOGYBI", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B007L6VR6M", "B000CS464G", "B0006TPE4C", "081099741X", "B00005JMJ4", "B000934FC2", "B0035G5IOE", "B00JAQJNN0", "B00005JMJG", "B000BRD6T4", "B0045NXMJE", "B00007AJF8", "B00H9HZITU", "B0018BD9DA", "B004SEUIXS", "1623160510", "B001P3SA8K", "B000JMK6LW", "B0018O4YT0", "B001MM3AZM", "B0006H32EI", "B002E2M5IC", "B0012E2GFK", "B000M4RG7E", "B0007DFJ0G", "B000Y7U98C", "B001NPD9PY", "B00IJXJAIS", "B000A7DVR2", "B008MIMWP8", "B004FQX5B6", "B00GKOJ98E", "0783228457", "B000K7VHOG", "B002LMV7RA", "B00008RH3J", "B0009A40ES", "B00DL46ZN8", "0957490909", "B000F5GNX8", "B00005JLRE", "B00006AUIH", "B00005V9HH", "B00GMV8L1Q", "B001JIE7JM", "B000IU37SO", "B004RQDQIQ", "B00AEBB8SS", "B00006LPGP", "B00000K3TS", "B00H9L28OO", "B007D5E7C2", "B000065AI3", "B0033WH6MW", "B008220D5K", "B0014D5RBE", "B001BPJJ9G", "B00005JL78", "B007D0FVRM", "B00AEFYOJE", "B00003CXZ4", "6304493681", "B0083V2W4U", "B000Z8GZYW", "B008R65XNS", "0783229526", "B00HGGUTPW", "B003UESJMO", "B005HK13SG", "B000P0J0EW", "B002VWNIAY", "B000P0J0D8", "B004SIP7ZS", "B001HN69AY", "B003XURDAY", "B00H7KJRVY", "B00ECR7KX2", "B001GMAVGE", "B005LAIIJY", "B000055Y0X", "B0000AC8LR", "B000K7VHQE", "B00AEFYAMA", "6305922756", "B0041T52S6", "B009YQJ322", "B003CRM6PA", "B002T9H2LA", "B000O76ZQC", "B0040QYROA", "B005MYEQ4U", "B00I6JOD2S", "B00FZ4KR4U"], "bought_together": ["B0010X8NF0", "B0000640VJ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00JAQJMJ0", "B0010X8NF0", "B007L6VR12", "B0000640VJ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 72305}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.5, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B00005JNLQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51H5Q2VBE1L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou (The Criterion Collection)"}

{"description": "Critics and controversy aside,The Da Vinci Codeis a verifiable blockbuster. Combine the film's huge worldwide box-office take with over 100 million copies of Dan Brown's book sold, andThe Da Vinci Codehas clearly made the leap from pop-culture hit to a certifiable franchise. The leap for any story making the move from book to big screen, however, is always more perilous. In the case ofThe Da Vinci Code, the plot is concocted of such a preposterous formula of elements that you wouldn&#x92;t envy screenwriter Akiva Goldsman, the man tasked with making this story filmable. The script followsDan Brown&#x92;s bookas closely as possible while incorporating a few needed changes, including a better ending. And if you&#x92;re like most of the world, by now you&#x92;ve read the book and know how it goes: while lecturing in Paris, noted Harvard Professor of Symbology Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) is summoned to the Louvre by French police to help decipher a bizarre series of clues left at the scene of the murder of the chief curator. Enter Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou), gifted cryptologist. Neveu and Langdon team up to solve the mystery, and from there the story is propelled across Europe, ballooning into a modern-day mini-quest for the Holy Grail, where secret societies are discovered, codes are broken, and murderous albino monks are thwarted&#x85; oh, and alternative theories about the life of Christ and the beginnings of Christianity are presented too, of course. It&#x92;s not the typical formula for a stock Hollywood thriller. In fact, taken solely as a mystery, the movie almost works--despite some gaping holes--mostly just because it keeps moving. Brown&#x92;s greatest trick was  to have the entire story take place in one day, so the action is forced to keep moving, despite some necessary pauses for exposition. As a screen couple, Hanks and Tautou are just fine together but not exactly memorable; meanwhile Sir Ian McKellen&#x92;s scenery-chewing as pivotal character Sir Leigh Teabing is just what the film needed to keep it from taking itself too seriously. The whole thing is like a good roller-coaster ride: try not to think too much about it--just sit back and enjoy the trip.--Daniel VanciniVisit The Da Vinci Code StoreOn The DVDThe DVD extras on a film as popular asThe Da Vinci Codeshould be plentiful, and this version doesn&#x92;t skimp. With over 90 minutes of special features, including ten behind-the-scenes featurettes, there&#x92;s a lot here to explore beyond the film itself. The question is, is there anything new here that we haven&#x92;t heard before, in all the hype, pseudo-documentaries, and controversy surrounding the movie, to make it worthwhile?  For most viewers, the answer will be \"yes.\" Essentially, if you like the movie, if you enjoyed the book, you will get a lot out of them.Just as the movie is intended to make the book come to life, the DVD extras should make the film come to life by pointing the audience into the world of the filmmakers, connecting the dots between print and film, and for the most part they do just that. The extras here range from the typical look behind-the-scenes to more in-depth features on the supporting characters, the locations, and theMona Lisaherself.  \"First Day on the Set with Ron Howard\" features the director gushing about the opportunity to film in the Louvre and work with Tom Hanks again (the two worked together before onSplashandApollo 13). It&#x92;s a short piece that doesn&#x92;t reveal much beyond making an attempt to share Howard&#x92;s excitement (with the \"Gee, I really loved working with him/her on this project\" that you hear in every such featurette), but viewers might enjoy seeing how the stage was set up in the famous museum, down to the spike tape on the floor showing actors where to hit their marks.The Filmmaking Experience, Parts 1 and 2further explores the creative and technical aspects of the filmmaking process.A Conversation with Dan Brownstarts out feeling like a puff-piece (the man who wrote this book got started at age 5 with a story calledThe Giraffe, The Pig, and the Pants on Fire. \"It was a thriller,\" he says.) and unfortunately it doesn&#x92;t go very deep into much of anything of interest. But on the other hand, this isn&#x92;t60 Minuteshere; it&#x92;s intended to give viewers a better sense of the man behind the franchise, which it does.  Much of the footage from this interview is sprinkled throughout some of the other featurettes. Meanwhile, the character behind the franchise, Robert Langdon, is examined in his own featurette, as is Sophie Neveu. The cool thing here is getting under the skin of the actors to see how they approached the characters, knowing that most of the movie-going public already has formed their own ideas about the characters from the book.The most interesting extras are the featurettes that focus on the history behind the mystery. Or is it the mystery behind the history?  Either way, the first one on theMona Lisa, and the second featurette on the many codes and symbols that are hidden throughout the movie balance out the remainder of the extras nicely by demonstrating the sense of intrigue, mystery, and game-playing adventure that madeThe Da Vinci Codeso popular in the first place.--Daniel VanciniBeyondThe Da Vinci CodeThe Films of Tom HanksThe Films of Ron HowardThe Da Vinci DVDs: Decoding \"The Da Vinci Code\"More About The ArtistStills fromThe Da Vinci Code(click for larger image)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002O5M4T4", "B00005JN5E", "B0013BM63O", "B002ZTQVKM", "B0007XG02W", "B001OLP2TI", "B002C68WNW", "0307474275", "B002O5M4SU", "B00005JLSB", "B000PHVZNE", "B0077ATSSQ", "B00AEFY0F2", "B000EPR7NE", "0743486226", "B001LMAK9W", "B000P0J0EW", "0385504209", "B005HWAOP2", "B001OQCV2E", "B0013XZ2QK", "B001EZE5D8", "B00005JL3T", "B000EOTW0Q", "6304711891", "B000YDBPAM", "0307950689", "B000HT386M", "B00008G8M4", "B000P0J0EM", "B002ZG99KO", "0800141806", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B00001ZWUS", "B0002V7OI8", "B002O3Z50Q", "B0006GANOQ", "B002NZK5UU", "B000NQRR1Q", "0385504225", "B004SIP7ZS", "B00005Y71F", "B000OYC7BW", "B00DL48BM6", "B00026ZG10", "B0018CWW5K", "B00004BZIY", "B0000B1OFL", "B00023B1LC", "B000N6U0E2", "B00A8MGIZG", "B00005JM5E", "B002LMV7R0", "B00004Z4WR", "B000K2UGXO", "B00005JMYC", "B001MVYUQG", "B00005JLWN", "B000056PMU", "B0000AOV4I", "B00AEFY4CG", "B00441GYXS", "B001F12J0C", "B00ES28X3C", "B002ZG980U", "B001VLBDD0", "B00008K76U", "B001TK80C0", "B008JFURII", "B000VWYJ86", "0792159659", "B00AEFYGBA", "B0009MDPYM", "B00177YA1K", "B00005N5S5", "B0043X1FM2", "B0002J58HO", "B00005JM5B", "B00AZMFJYA", "B003AWRMBA", "074349346X", "B003VA3JUO", "0783240295", "6305767866", "B0000844I8", "B000065U1N", "B002GHHHKQ", "B000K7VHQE", "B0000AXE8I", "0800177258", "B000ASDFGI", "B003Q6D2B4", "B000HRMAPE", "B000U7WV1Y", "B00005JMOW", "B00GPWEPZ8", "0312944926", "B000VI70QS", "B000KF0GWW"], "bought_together": ["B002O5M4T4", "B00005JN5E"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002O5M4T4", "B00I563DSC", "B0013BM63O", "1400079152"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 7555}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.5, "brand": "DaVinci", "asin": "B00005JOC9", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51SLBDLMtIL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Da Vinci Code (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition)"}

{"description": "From the writer of BRING IT ON comes STICK IT, the fun, irreverent comedy that turns the competitive world of gymnastics on its head. After walking out on her teammates at the gymnastics championships two years before, the talented but rebellious Haley Graham is forced to return to the rigid world of rules, catfights, and spandex. Her in-your-face attitude quickly collides with her hard-nosed coach and teammates. But as her love of the sport resurfaces, Haley slowly earns their respect by doing what she does best -- tossing out the rules.  And in the process, she learns there are more valuable things to win in life than medals and ribbons.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0047HXMLQ", "B002TOCE9K", "B0047HXMJ8", "B000J4QW7W", "B00IBIIR4E", "B002DOBGWM", "B00AEBB8R4", "B0026BXHQ0", "B003QZSWU6", "0991816455", "B00003CXMP", "B000WC39MM", "B000ERVJHW", "B000J3OTSM", "B00F76KYSA", "B0010X5X4O", "1938438094", "B008HHB84K", "099181648X", "B00447L4KA", "B000GJ0LLI", "B003ASXMTA", "B00004XPPD", "B003NHRIVQ", "1927794005", "1423136586", "B0018CNNV2", "B0036TGSIK", "B0006SSMWE", "B0016MJ6GU", "B0007LXPBI", "B004EPZ0BG", "B0007Z9R66", "B001B7CO0K", "B001K2LFNI", "B00175VSBW", "B008JFUUIA", "B009ANP4F4", "B00AEFYM2S", "B001H1I8KK", "B004529NKC", "B000B2YR92", "B00005JLH0", "B006X08DZ0", "B003B3V0N4", "1423136322", "1423136578", "B000FUTVLY", "B0000524E5", "1414380925", "B0007US7C6", "B000GB775E", "B0009JE57G", "B000FS9MXI", "B00005JPK8", "B002VPTJOA", "B0012QCZ54", "B00AEFXSLE", "0310740673", "B0024NSFYO", "B000F6IODE", "B00466RV4M", "B0017TWV0U", "B002K0WBXW", "B00795C5X4", "B003Y5H524", "B000WC39KE", "B001GC9VK6", "B004SIP9X8", "B00HNTOYRQ", "B0039Q8X9C", "6305428425", "B0049TC88U", "B00AMEZDJW", "B004QIG7CW", "B00LG6YEKE", "B00AEFYQE2", "B000IZJZIU", "B00AEFZ3XU", "B001NE80P4", "B004ODLUIA", "B001Y8DJVE", "B00005JM9Q", "B00682LS4G", "B00003CY5P", "B0007LXPBS", "B001AV3BWM", "B002XUBDRY", "B000Y9PC7S", "B003Y5H5B0", "B000209KMW", "B003Y5H574", "B00008L3SY", "B002GOAH1U", "B0007Z9R5W", "B003TY2SWC", "0800195175", "B001OQCVI8", "B00005JLYW", "B000QXDG4S"], "bought_together": ["B002TOCE9K", "B0047HXMLQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0991816455", "B003QZSWU6", "B0000524E5", "B00IBIIR4E"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 3173}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.99, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B00005JOZC", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Oo6rlcw8L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Stick It"}

{"description": "You know you're going to get a different kind of superhero when you cast Robert Downey Jr. in the lead role. AndIron Manis different, in welcome ways. Cleverly updated from Marvel Comics' longstanding series,Iron Manputs billionaire industrialist Tony Stark (that's Downey) in the path of some Middle Eastern terrorists; in a brilliantly paced section, Stark invents an indestructible suit that allows him to escape. If the rest of the movie never quite hits that precise rhythm again, it nevertheless offers plenty of pleasure, as the renewed Stark swears off his past as a weapons manufacturer, develops his new Iron Man suit, and puzzles both his business partner (Jeff Bridges in great form) and executive assistant (Gwyneth Paltrow). Director Jon Favreau geeks out in fun ways with the hardware, but never lets it overpower the movie, and there's always a goofy one-liner or a slapstick pratfall around to break the tension. As for Downey, he doesn't get to jitterbug around too much in his improv way, but he brings enough of his unpredictable personality to keep the thing fresh. And listen up, hardcore Marvel mavens: even if you know the Stan Lee cameo is coming, you won't be able to guess it until it's on the screen. It all builds to a splendid final scene, with a concluding line delivery by Downey that just feels absolutely right.--Robert HortonStills fromIron Man(Click for larger image)&nbsp;", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00E5I2M6I", "B008JFUO72", "B001DHXT20", "B00E5I2M9K", "B00E5I2MEK", "B0083SBMBM", "B008JFUS0U", "B001CDR1FG", "B00E5I2MAO", "B004LWZWFQ", "B001GCUO1Q", "B008JFUPFI", "B000VI70QS", "B000HEVZ9E", "B0000959N0", "B00005JKCH", "B00005JNJV", "B00005JNTU", "B0090SI56Y", "B000VR0570", "B00005JMQW", "B002HWRYJE", "B0007P0Y7C", "B004LWZW42", "B00D7OMNXS", "B001OQCV6A", "B007K3JFUQ", "B004EPZ07K", "B004LWZWGA", "B000UR9T8C", "B0083SBJXS", "B0060FXDCG", "B002IPFWTE", "B00E5I2ME0", "B00IXD2MGQ", "B000AYELVA", "B00C6B8TB8", "B008QZ5PY2", "B000OVLBF8", "B000AYELVU", "B00AZMFJYA", "B001QB9H1U", "B009JBWOU0", "B001AK3S4Y", "B001GZ6QC4", "B005G4TJUC", "B002NXSRVG", "B000HCO83Q", "B003YOZNBU", "B003Q6D2B4", "B00023B1LC", "B0002IQMAM", "B008JFURII", "B00HERGM86", "B00E5I2MDQ", "B006VRRGNK", "B002ZG99QS", "B00000JQB5", "B007REV4T8", "B00008G8M5", "B008Y1YK9Y", "B0002ZDVEU", "6305718954", "B001DTPZNY", "B005LAIGW8", "B001F7MSFM", "B001GCUNWQ", "B00A2H9P98", "B000RW3VDE", "B002O5M4T4", "B00005JA8B", "B005LAIIPS", "B005LAII44", "B00BEIYHO2", "B000GUJZ00", "B00005N5S5", "B002SJIO4A", "B000VWYJ86", "B004EPZ0BG", "B0049IHX2C", "B00AEBBAEK", "B00005JM5E", "B008JFUOWM", "B000FS9FCG", "B00005PJ6N", "B00979KQFO", "B00AEFXKUI", "B002K0WBXW", "B0042U94UQ", "B004EPYZUS", "B008JFUQZ2", "B0084IG8TM", "B001DJLD1M", "B008JFUS5A", "B00006HBUJ", "B000J103OI", "B00F84H73Q", "B0087ZG7NO", "B000U1ZV8K"], "bought_together": ["B00E5I2M6I", "B008JFUO72"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B008JFUO72", "B00E5I2M6I", "B001DHXT20", "B00E5I2MEK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 12121}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.99, "brand": "DOWNEY,ROBERT JR.", "asin": "B00005JPS8", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515wjJQt2nL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Iron Man (Ultimate 2 Disc Edition)"}
{"description": "Marriage is a huge step in any relationship and, with the divorce rate skyrocketing, some clergymen find it advisable to council prospective couples prior to the marriage ceremony. Reverend Frank (Robin Williams) takes his marriage preparation course to a whole new level, putting couples through a very unusual and grueling set of classes that cover everything from trust and communication to experiencing childbirth, meeting each other's needs in and out of bed, and group sessions on how to fight fairly. Happy couple Sadie Jones's (Mandy Moore) and Ben Murphy's (John Krasinski) perfect compatibility is tested to the limits with extraordinary (and hysterical) assignments like caring for twin baby robots that cry and poop without restraint while baby-sitting a friend's two young children and shopping for wedding china. Driving a car blindfolded while one's intended gives directions is no simple task either, but abstinence from sex and writing their own marriage vows may be the couple's most difficult homework assignments. Comedy reigns throughout the entire movie thanks to Robin Williams, his choir-boy assistant Josh Flitter (Nancy Drew) and the rest of the cast and laughing out loud is definitely a course requirement for viewers, but underneath the hilarity is a serious message about making marriage work.--Tami HoriuchiDVD featuresIncludes widescreen anamorphic and full-screen versionsAdditional scenes with optional director commentaryAsk Choir Boy: Choose which relationship/marital questions he answers", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00561BNI6", "B000OCZA04", "B000P0J08S", "B00104AYFQ", "B0000CDRVU", "B001TUZD8O", "B00005JN3W", "B000A343RI", "B00008WJD6", "B0015I2RT8", "B0034GK78W", "B002ZG989G", "B00003CXSM", "B001AKTZW8", "B003B3V0N4", "6304584210", "B004EPZ070", "B001BL96JI", "B00AEBB8NS", "B001OQCUZM", "B002ZG9968", "B000LC5B7O", "B00005JPSM", "B000Y7U93C", "B00005JG6N", "B001Y8DJVE", "B008R65XWO", "B003EYVXXC", "B000BKVQS4", "B0009OL7Z4", "B00AEBB9M8", "B000ELJAEM", "B002K0WBXW", "B000ICM5X0", "B000GB775E", "B000RETOGA", "B00005JN4H", "B00006FMUW", "B00386EZKE", "B002ZG97QK", "B00AEFY99O", "B0049TC88U", "B003Y5H524", "B0000DZ6N3", "B000MEYJHE", "B0021L8UOY", "B000E6EHE0", "B0038N9X3Q", "B00007976U", "B00AEFXWXI", "B00008VFCA", "B00005JN0Z", "B0038N9WKU", "B002SYAGNC", "B00007E2F5", "B00DMDE02Q", "B002ZG984Q", "B0015U0QVW", "B0012KJ0DK", "B004IK30PA", "B000YAA68C", "B0002OXRSG", "B002ZG97B0", "B0002I84N0", "B0007RT9M6", "B004SIP9X8", "B000099T4E", "B00006ZXSL", "B001CTA1UM", "B001C5LLQ4", "B000HCPS94", "B00164KYV4", "B000P0J0DS", "B004SIP7I0", "B00005JMXX", "B002ZG998G", "B0000897EG", "B000J4QW7W", "B00466HN7M", "B00AEBB8R4", "B003Y5H4ZW", "B002ZG98FU", "B005LAIIB2", "B000957O82", "B003UEYBPI", "B000EMGICS", "B00AEFYWQY", "B00029LO5E", "B002ZGW92E", "B0026BXHQ0", "B000VKL6T8", "B00HW3EZZE", "B005LAIGSM", "B000LC4Z8A", "B0010X5X4O", "B002ZG99UE", "B000E8N8H0", "B002U4UYZA", "B001HN69C2", "B004HO6I2E"], "bought_together": ["B000OCZA04"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0034GK78W", "B002ZG989G", "B00561BNI6", "B001Y8DJVE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 56082}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.99, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00005JPQE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51-wgdGowCL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "License to Wed"}

{"description": "In this French drama, Gaspar Noe, who won awards (Prix Georges Sadoul, Cannes Crix Week) for his 40-minute Carne (1991), continues where that film ended, beginning with a Carne recap: The Butcher (Philippe Nahon) narrates, telling how, as a war orphan working at 14, he opened his horsemeat butcher shop and fathered a mute, retarded daughter. After the mother and daughter left for life in a Paris suburb, he served a prison term after an assault on someone he mistakenly believed had raped his daughter. The follow-up sequel, set in a Lille suburb, begins in 1980: Obese bar owner (Franjkyie Pain) is pregnant by The Butcher, who is unable to find work. The couple moves in with her mother, but he becomes irritated with the two women and goes to Paris where the humiliation of job-hunting and the sum total of futility and hopelessness triggers thoughts of what he might accomplish with his gun and his last three bullets.

Poirot has his own poignant drama woven into the plot: he was originally invited to Baghdad by the Countess Vera Rosakoff (whom viewers may remember from \"The Double Clue\" inAgatha Christie's Poirot, Vol. 5) but she is not at her hotel when he arrives. Poirot's dejection at her continued absence makes an apt framing device for this tale of a murderer driven by passion.

{"description": "O Brother, wherever thou art, behold what thou and thy kin hath wrought.  With the documentaryAmerican Roots Musicand its spinoffs (including abookandCD collection), producers Jim Brown                       and Sam Pollard clearly were influenced by the popularity of the 2000 filmO Brother, Where Art Thou?and  itsmusic. You won't be seeing  Eminem and Mariah Carey here, or even Duke Ellington and Ray Charles, but rather  a comprehensive, if flawed, four-part documentary examining the various cultural  and ethnic folk traditions that blended together to create the rich, multi- flavored brew that is American music.Narrated by Kris Kristofferson, each of the four parts is a little less than an  hour long. Episode One offers a brief overview before detailing topics like the  spread of music via Victrolas and radio, the early days of country music and the  Grand Ole Opry, the rise of black gospel music, and seminal blues musicians like  Son House, Mamie Smith, and Robert Johnson. Episode Two deals with western music  (Gene Autry, Bob Wills), Bill Monroe and bluegrass, Hank Williams, Woody                       Guthrie, and more blues (Leadbelly, Sonny Boy Williamson, B.B. King). Episode  Three, perhaps the best of the lot, takes on urban blues (Muddy Waters, Howlin'  Wolf), black spirituals, and the early '60s folk boom, while Episode Four  studies Cajun, zydeco and Tex-Mex styles, along with Native American music and  more.The style is standard documentary, with interviews and photos interspersed with  new and old live footage. The producers tout the presence of \"rare performances\"  by Guthrie, Waters, Monroe, Clifton Chenier, and many others, and they're  fascinating. But for whatever reason (lack of time or maybe lack of faith in  viewers' attention spans) none is presented in its entirety. It's a drawback  that is remedied to some extent by the addition of six bonus clips (three on  each DVD) thatarecomplete, including wonderful vintage films of Western  Swing master Bob Wills and the remarkable gospel singer/guitarist Sister Rosetta  Tharpe.--Sam Graham", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005OAY6", "B0002234XQ", "B00064AMDU", "B0018PH3OC", "0810982234", "B000BITUEI", "B00000GQ3T", "B00009VU35", "B000QUCMY6", "B000050IKX", "B000BITUNE", "B000065U3M", "B000BVNS7U", "B0030CNO62", "B000X1ZPEM", "B0071BY2PU", "B00006672N", "B004AR4VRW", "B00028G7JI", "B00006ADF1", "B000KJU1JG", "B000JBY13C", "B000001DJU", "B000JMK6IU", "B002KJ7OG2", "080784862X", "B00008AOWT", "B0042MFQ92", "B001XJBDN0", "0064430782", "B000063NDJ", "0486285731", "B0002A2WDQ", "0495916218", "B00005PJBR", "B001NXDSLQ", "B004OFWLO0", "B008B1SJOE", "B00008J2HC", "B00006RJ58"], "bought_together": ["B00005OAY6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005OAY6", "B0002234XQ", "B00000GQ3T", "B000065U3M"]}, "price": 26.18, "categories": [["CDs & Vinyl", "Blues", "Acoustic Blues"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Blues", "Traditional Blues"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Country", "Bluegrass"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Country", "Classic Country"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Country", "Cowboy"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Folk", "Traditional Folk"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Rock"], ["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 29496}, "asin": "B00005Q65K", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ymQDo03SL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "American Roots Music [DVD]"}
{"description": "Like the TV incarnation ofThe Odd Couple, theM*A*S*Hseries has supplanted the original film in the public's consciousness. Legendary comedy writer Larry Gelbart (Your Show of Shows) deserves a medal for developing Robert Altman's bloody, funny 1970 classic for television with much of its anti-establishment spirit intact. These 24 first-season episodes--bracingly less politically correct than the shows in the final seasons--chart the program's sometimes bumpy evolution as it tried to remain true to the film's anarchic spirit while finding its own voice. The most memorable episodes include \"The Pilot,\" which establishes the characters in broad strokes; \"Sometimes You Hear the Bullet,\" in which a friend of Hawkeye's (Alan Alda) dies on the operating table (look for \"Ronny\" Howard as an underage soldier); \"Cowboy,\" in which someone is trying to kill clueless commander Henry Blake (McLean Stevenson); and the pivotal \"Dear Dad,\" the first of what would be a series of multistory episodes in which Hawkeye writes to his father about life at the 4077th. It is interesting to note film characters who made early exits from the series, including Timothy Brown's Spearchucker and Karen Philipp's Lt. Dish (George Morgan, who plays Father Mulcahy in the pilot, we hardly knew ye). Klinger (Jamie Farr), bucking for his Section 8 discharge, doesn't appear until the fifth episode, \"Chief Surgeon Who?\" And Gary Burghoff's Radar is a much more wily and savvy partner in crime to \"Yankee Doodle Doctors\" Hawkeye and Trapper John (Wayne Rogers) than in later seasons. In its 11-year run,M*A*S*Hearned 14 Emmy Awards, and it remains one of TV's most beloved series. Though it is a staple of syndication, the episodes are presented here uncut, probably for the first time since their original broadcast. ForM*A*S*Hdevotees, this three-disc set is just what the doctor ordered.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001DMVZJO", "B001DMVZJY", "B001DMVZKI", "B001DMVZL2", "B001DMVZLW", "B001DMVZLM", "B001DMVZM6", "B001DMVZN0", "B001DMVZNA", "B001DMVZNK", "B0001ZJ1HW", "B00008YGS0", "B00008NV4G", "B000OT6V1E", "B00BMJ7ZKG", "B000HT3P5G", "B002E58FT2", "B0007KIFK0", "B0002NY8R6", "B000B837XS", "B0024HH32A", "B000291Q3Y", "B0006N2EZK", "B00008EY6N", "B000NJMJHA", "B0002NY8PI", "B000068V9Y", "B000A6T1J0", "B0000E32X2", "B00005JMHI", "B000NOIX7K", "B00005JLIC", "B000291Q3O", "B003JV0ITA", "B000EWBNMI", "B0050MB5AC", "B000MXPE6U", "B000CCBCK8", "B0001NBNIY", "B000FSME1K", "B000IHYXIK", "B0007Y08P6", "B001OXLGK0", "B000LV6W00", "B00A2L1CJK", "B00009VRF0", "B000068V9X", "B00HVFA36I", "0688149553", "B00GOC75YW", "B000E3L7EQ", "B0000ZMH8S", "B000YKYT1M", "B000HT3P5Q", "B0000DC3VM", "B00008R9MC", "B000H7JCHS", "B000YGGNGK", "B0085Z6ZD8", "B0000DFZ5O", "B0012EBV8I", "B0006BAWSI", "B001E6JC26", "B000VDDDY6", "B000BOH986", "B000EOTTS6", "B000NTMA1U", "B00GHH9HUE", "B0012EBV88", "B008KZX7W0", "B000A0GXGK", "B0087GKHXO", "B0002W4SX6", "B000UX6TKM", "B0009UC7MK", "B0007LXP86", "B000MGBSH6", "B000N6UF10", "B0002W4SWW", "B000EQ46HI", "B0009OUBPQ", "B0002I837M", "B00JHH1VUU", "B0006N2EZA", "B00361XWEQ", "B000NOIX66", "B00005JLEX", "B000UX6TJI", "B002C2KAS6", "B000BGR1B4", "B0001ZMWXW", "B000HWZ4HU", "B000BNTM46", "B00HRUQA6O", "B0007US79Y", "B005IQGNHK", "B009OE2O7A", "B002L9N4O2", "B000F9T70A"], "bought_together": ["B001DMVZJO", "B001DMVZJY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00BMJ7ZKG", "B001DMVZJO", "B001DMVZJY", "B000HT3P5Q"]}, "price": 32.88, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 79655}, "asin": "B00005QVVC", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516996K0KCL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "M*A*S*H - Season One (Collector's Edition)"}

The creator ofThe Civil WarandJazzachieves reverent harmony with the magnificent story of Missouri-born author Samuel Clemens (a.k.a.

Burns's film backs that claim as it follows Clemens's literary odyssey around the globe, from unrivaled acclaim as a writer to near destitution and the devastating deaths of his wife and three children. As usual, eloquent writers and scholars (including longtime Twain performer Hal Holbrook) provide a wondrous flow of anecdotes and observations, recounting Twain's remarkable humor while acknowledging a darker side that felt anger toward an indifferent god.

The weightless characters move in simple, repeated cycles and never come in contact with the ground when they walk or run.

{"description": "Sally Field stars in this well-crafted revenge thriller.Eye for an  Eyefollows Karen McCann (Field) after her teenage daughter is raped and murdered. At first, she sinks into depression and paranoia; but, when the killer (Kiefer Sutherland) is caught, then released on a technicality, she becomes obsessed and begins to track him in his neighborhood. Her single-mindedness begins to distance her from her husband (Ed Harris). Finally, when the killer threatens her younger daughter, she decides to take matters into her own hands.Eye for an Eyeis not exactly a balanced examination of justice and revenge--Sutherland's killer is a relentless monster--but it does approach the conflict from many points of view, articulated by a superb supporting cast, including Joe Mantegna, Beverly D'Angelo, Charlayne Woodard, Philip Baker Hall, Keith David, and Donal Logue. It's directed with professional skill by John Schlesinger (Midnight Cowboy,Marathon Man).--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305213305", "B00AEFXKZ8", "B00005N89Q", "B0002IQLHQ", "B002NZK5RI", "B00AEFXBPM", "B00AEFXT1S", "B00013RC7K", "B00009WVSL", "B00008L3S6", "B00002E23C", "B00AEFXX9Q", "B00015YVDG", "B00006HAWN", "B00005V9HY", "B002AT8KAG", "B000EHQU0S", "B002NZK5VO", "B00AEBBA2W", "B0043X1FNQ", "B00005NRN8", "B000MMMTBY", "6302067057", "0790730979", "B0002CR036", "B00803PG44", "0792846443", "B000059HAN", "0767802616", "B00007AJE1", "B00026ZD04", "B0045HCJ8K", "B002AT8K9W", "0800177789", "B005TZFZ5Q", "B000K7UBSY", "B0002DB54A", "B000E5N684", "B002O3Z4WK", "B00AEFXEGS", "B002NZK5UU", "B00013RC66", "B0000541TM", "B001D0T4IU", "B000CS45H4", "B000EWBNQO", "B00005JKQS", "0783240295", "6305308837", "076781083X", "0767815718", "B00096S49Y", "B00BEIYIF0", "6304806434", "B002DKGWSE", "B00004Y87P", "0767821769", "B00006RCNY", "B000F8DV1M", "B0000JCFMW", "6305310335", "B003ASLJIQ", "B002AMVEII", "0767815122", "B00001U0DM", "6305692572", "B000KP62FM", "B0010HOZW6", "B000JBXXYK", "B002AS464Q", "B00005JG6N", "B000BYY11Y", "B00AEFYC96", "B0077PHJ6E", "B0006HBZXS", "6301971345", "B000JBXHZK", "B00BDZV8ZM", "B0000VV55I", "B002CAWNEM", "B00005Y1UX", "B0006GANOQ", "B00005JH9M", "B0038RSJB4", "B00AEFY4CG", "6305236569", "B00BLN4UKQ", "B000059XTK", "B00011CYMK", "B0001FR3IQ", "B00AIA8AKE", "B00000IRE6", "B00021R7BM", "630523650X", "B0029Z8K74", "B002GLG5OQ", "B000HC2LHG", "B0053TWVSC", "0767810872"], "bought_together": ["B00AEFXKZ8", "6305213305"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005N89Q", "B00AEFXKZ8", "6305213305", "B002AS464Q"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 24296}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 13.3, "brand": "FIELD,SALLY", "asin": "B00005Y1UV", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41JJM2XD0TL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Eye for an Eye"}

{"description": "M*A*S*Hredux. Sign up for another stint with the 4077th. This three-disc set contains all 24 episodes from the superb second season (1973-74) of the series ranked byTV Guideas among the top 25 television shows of all time. The season opener, \"Divided We Stand,\" is a deft reintroduction to these now iconic characters: bleeding-heart surgeon Hawkeye Pearce (Alan Alda in his signature role), kindred misfit spirit Trapper John (Wayne Rogers), clueless administrator Henry Blake (McLean Stevenson), buttoned-up Frank Burns (Larry Linville), and unbuttoned head nurse \"Hot Lips\" (Loretta Swit). In this episode, a visiting psychiatrist evaluates the 4077th to determine whether the unit \"can function as a team.\" His evaluation can serve as this series' mission statement: \"These impossible people are in an impossible place doing totally impossible things. They're mad--quite mad.\"M*A*S*Hexperienced no sophomore slump from its Emmy Award-winning first season. It continued to subvert sitcom convention with multiple-story episodes such as \"Radar's Report.\" Scenes in the operating room play without a laugh track (this DVD gives viewers the option of watching entire episodes minus the intrusive chuckles and guffaws).M*A*S*Halso tackled such issues as racism (\"Dear Dad... Three,\" \"L.I.P.--Local Indigenous Personnel\"), homophobia (\"George\"), and war atrocities (Hawkeye and Trapper try to get the Army to take responsibility for the accidental shelling of a South Korean village). Not thatM*A*S*Hforgot how to be funny. \"Five O'Clock Charlie\" and \"For Want of a Boot\" are strictly for laughs. Hawkeye and Hot Lips memorably exchange flu shots in \"Carry On, Hawkeye.\" Loyal viewers will note the emergence of several supporting characters, including Jamie Farr's Klinger and William Christopher's Father Mulcahy. One also sees the (to some) unfortunate transformation of Gary Burghoff's savvy, crackerjack clerk Radar into a na&#xEF;ve innocent.

{"description": "The third broadcast season of Rumiko Takahashi's long-running transgender comedy was clearly one of the high points in the series: \"Am I Pretty\" may well rank as its funniest installment. When he insults her cooking yet again, Akane clobbers Ranma with an iron skillet--which somehow brings out the feminine side of his nature. The normally loutish Ranma suddenly becomes obsessed with frills, fine cooking, and extreme modesty (he blushes at the sight of his own jockey shorts). The results are hilariously incongruous. \"Ryoga's Miracle,\" in which the geographically challenged Ryoga Hibiki finds a miraculous soap that seems to counteract the transforming spells of Jusenkyo, is only slightly less uproarious. The season begins with Ranma acquiring the last thing he needs or wants: another would-be fianc&#xE9;e, Ukyo, a championokonomiyakichef. The cross-dressing contretemps reach new heights of absurdity with the arrival of Ukyo's admirer, Tsubasa; soon no one knows who's who or what's what. Meanwhile, Chinese Amazon Shampoo serves pork buns laced with a love potion; Kuno banishes the long-suffering Sasuke, who takes refuge at the Tendo Dojo; and the entire cast competes to win a trip to China in the Miracle Martial Arts Obstacle Race. The set concludes with a no-holds-barred farce as Ranma attempts to change the past and keep himself from falling into the accursed spring at Jusenkyo. A must-have forRanmafans.

{"description": "From the moment Vic Perrin's omniscient \"Control Voice\" first proclaimed, \"There is nothing wrong with your television set,\" on September 16, 1963,The Outer Limitswas destined for greatness. The dazzling, long-beloved series was a daring experiment in \"omnibus\" TV, trading the speculative fantasies ofThe Twilight Zonefor farther-out sci-fi concepts. Producers Leslie Stevens and Joseph Stefano had risen as gifted writers from (respectively) Broadway and Hollywood; Stevens rebounded from his previous canceled series, while Stefano had scripted Hitchcock'sPsychoand was eager to expand his creative horizons. With an executive order for scary monsters and cold war thrills, their fruitful symbiosis was preceded by the superb Stevens-directed pilot \"Please Stand By,\" named after the series' once-proposed title and changed to \"The Galaxy Being\" for its broadcast premiere.Cliff Robertson launched an impressive succession of guest stars, and on meager, oft-exceeded budgets of $120,000 per episode,The Outer Limitsbecame a showcase for shoestring ingenuity. The \"blue ribbon crew\" (as Stevens called it) included cinematographer Conrad Hall, whose Oscar&#xAE;-winning skills were honed on the series' cramped TV-studio sets. Packed onto four double-sided DVDs, these 32 episodes (out of a total 49) comprise the series' dynamic first season of moody, frequently paranoid black-and-white adventures. Repeat performers Martin Landau, Robert Culp, and Sally Kellerman excel (respectively) in the fan-favorite episodes \"The Man Who Was Never Born,\" \"The Architects of Fear,\" and \"The Bellero Shield\" (and who can forget the insect-like menace of \"The Zanti Misfits\"?). There are a few clunkers, of course, but the series' quality (and parade of monsters) is remarkably consistent, and DVD compression doesnotcompromise its technical achievement. These eerily seductive shows invite repeated viewing, supporting Stephen King's oft-quoted remark thatThe Outer Limitswas \"the best program of its type ever to run on network TV.\"--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000QTCY7M", "B00009Y3RE", "B000OPOAKW", "B000B5IP4W", "B003BNO9GO", "B006TBYC76", "B001DXS4DI", "B0007CEXUY", "B001HNDR4A", "B005UL4NF2", "B0002CX1M0", "B000AL733G", "B0088R9KFI", "B000RPCT5W", "B002NPY7GS", "B002DMJM7K", "B000HDR814", "B00068NVLQ", "B00005JKFR", "B003OW6JAG", "B003NOGNQU", "B00D9EJFZA", "B00GT4NCBU", "B000TXPXD2", "B0002J4ZX2", "B00FEOYY8G", "B000FVQLKW", "B00BQK4YDC", "B00BI3XZA0", "B0042FJCKS", "B0016MOWNM", "B00005R1O7", "0441370810", "B000PISZ86", "B00EEEHLKU", "B000NOIX66", "B000UX6TJI", "B0002NRRRE", "B004E5BQDW", "B00GOC752E", "B0007XG2YS", "B0000V4906", "B0045Z2W0C", "B0002XVQNK", "B009D1G9S4", "B001LM64VA", "B003VJTGNE", "B0006HBV3C", "B00FGAKEEQ", "B000H5U5EE", "B008XB2UCE", "B00013D54Y", "B0002IQKAY", "B000UYN9M2", "B0007R4T26", "B001AXOFR0", "B000EHSVJG", "B00114XLZK", "0767810864", "B0024396EM", "B00005JOJE", "B00012L786", "B002MJV786", "B00092ZLDK", "B000BOH8Z0", "B000RXVNDI", "B00E5G03I4", "B009OE2O2A", "B0044O1Q60", "B009OE2O3Y", "B00004RFAY", "B000QQJ3Q0", "B003CPPY0Q", "B002FLOTPO", "B000HWZ4HU", "B000SMNK16", "B001A7GOCA", "B00CA4S024", "B00008YLVB", "B000R7I48G", "B00004REEI", "B0001US8F8", "B0006BAWYM", "B001DHXT3Y", "B009OE2O0C", "B0006HBV32", "B003KSO3QQ", "B00ADRYGSC", "B00004Y87O", "B003VPEAHK", "B0007R4SZY", "B0002S94BQ", "B00AQ6J5YA", "B00005NSXY", "B001MT7ZJC", "B004VUNVEM", "B003Y7J8DG", "B0000AKY54", "B002H047OG", "B001OXLGKA"], "bought_together": ["B000QTCY7M", "B000OPOAKW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0016MOWNM", "B000OPOAKW", "B000QTCY7M", "B00009Y3RE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 25413}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 98.99, "brand": "", "asin": "B000068V9R", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HCRFZHX7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Outer Limits - The Original Series, Season 1"}

Yep, you guessed it: tough guy/funny guy buddy flick.All About the Benjaminsis pretty much a by-the-numbers piece of work. There's plenty of macho posturing, gunfire, big-ticket items exploding, and curse words inserted into the script in lieu of actual punch lines. The plot has holes big enough to drive a locomotive through, but then again the plot isn't really the point. Epps's attempts at wacky comedy wear thin early on, but Ice Cube does a fine job, and together they do make quite a few moments hit.

Nothing inSouth Parkis sacred, and  each episode has something to offend, from \"Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride\"  (featuring George Clooney as the voice of Sparky, the homosexual dog), to the  Halloween episode \"Pink Eye,\" in which Cartman dresses up as Adolph Hitler. Best  not to even get started on Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Pooh, or the season finale  cliffhanger, \"Cartman's Mom Is a Dirty Slut.\"Each episode is preceded by a faux introduction by creators Trey Parker and Matt  Stone, who proclaim every episode to be their favorite. Their incarnations as  Rootin'-Tootin' Trey Parker and Pistol-Slingin' Matt Stone indicate that afterSouth Parkruns its course, they'd be great hosts of their own children's  show, which--and this cannot be stressed strongly enough--South Parkisnot. Other extras include theSouth Parkboys' appearance on the  CableAce awards and \"A South Park Thanksgiving,\" featuring Jay Leno, which aired  exclusively onThe Tonight Show. A minor annoyance is the slapdash  packaging that mislabels the episodes (\"Damien,\" for example, is on disc 3, not  2 as indicated).--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00023P49M", "B0000CABL2", "B0001ZWLVU", "B0006Z2L2Y", "B000ADWCYY", "B000CNESM6", "B000FSME2Y", "B000KLQUMQ", "B000R7I3XC", "B0018O5WUU", "B001O0TWXG", "B004MLEYTG", "B006W93ELK", "B0030Y11UG", "B009SQ9Q5M", "B000022TSW", "B00105308I", "B000USUA8E", "B00AEBB8TM", "B001O0TWXQ", "B004MLEYT6", "B006W93EM4", "B000ZT0S9O", "B0030Y11NS", "B009SQ9Y7M", "0762435704", "B000AQ68Z0", "B000083C6V", "B000OPO0LQ", "B008412UKA", "B007KFZ85K", "B000E6ES9O", "B00008YGRV", "B0001MZ7KA", "B0000AQS81", "0762435615", "B001CQONKO", "B003VJTGKW", "B007KFZ7YM", "B007KFZ88M", "B000HT3P6U", "B006IOAHTQ", "B001VFM0ZG", "B0012018OE", "B002CNKLTS", "B000RO6JZO", "B000H2M2R0", "B000UAE7UE", "B00G4RCF60", "B00005JM3G", "B00CJEKA2I", "B000NNK4DM", "B00008YGRS", "B007KFZ7UQ", "B002CNKTCW", "B006IOAHPK", "B009WSJHD2", "030789682X", "B000P2A6CA", "B00CJEK7GW", "B007KFZ8AA", "B00000J8BV", "B003DZX46G", "B000B5XOWU", "B003XJABTK", "B007ZFR67I", "B000ERVJNG", "B000B5XOR0", "B00C28X8IY", "0762438231", "B000ABKHZC", "B0028PO5R4", "B0002NY8XA", "B0024FAR52", "B003L77G7Y", "B0007CILMA", "B005QIOJ3A", "B001GQ3GHG", "B00008YGRZ", "B0012KSUTA", "B00L9K2EGS", "B00000I1BB", "B00AEFZ8OY", "B009TGW9S2", "B000KWZ1PC", "B001DZOD7C", "B007KFZ87S", "B00FEQ6IG0", "B000AQ68VO", "B0009VBTP0", "B00330WP6Q", "B001L1S1PI", "B008412UQ4", "B000GETTKM", "B003KZ27N0", "B000F9T700", "B0007PAM06", "B0006HBZEW", "B00CJEK8WA", "B00363WGB4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B009SQ9Q5M", "B0001ZWLVU", "B0000CABL2", "B00023P49M"]}, "price": 1.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 133903}, "asin": "B00006FDCR", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41GVGPYDDZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "South Park - The Complete First Season"}

{"description": "Like the classic D.H. Lawrence story it's based upon,The Rocking  Horse Winneris timeless and disturbingly effective. One of only seven films  directed by Anthony Pelissier, this beautifully atmospheric British production  ranks as the definitive filming of Lawrence's oft-adapted story, made shortly  after David Lean'sOliver TwistandGreat Expectationsand  featuring some of the same actors. John Howard Davies--excellent as Oliver in  Lean's film--is equally fine as the young boy who obsessively rides his new  rocking horse, mysteriously gaining the ability to predict winners of actual  horse races. This rescues his profligate mother (Valerie Hobson) from financial  ruin, but her reckless materialism is inevitably marred by tragedy. Although  British censors slightly softened the tragic blow that ends Lawrence's story  (included in its entirety in the DVD booklet), its impact is not diminished.  With John Mills in a pivotal role as producer and costar, this is a masterful  film not to be missed.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000286RQG", "B00DZP1C9K", "0767811097", "B0002VGSOO", "B0000714BZ", "0895987619", "B00082ZR26", "B00ALTQRUC", "B0000UHFBC", "6305416222", "B00005JKFR", "B00ECR7KX2", "B007KFZ7ZG", "B0080G8HWO", "B00082ZR1C", "B00082ZR3A", "B00009YXE5"], "bought_together": ["B0002VGSOO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0895987619", "B004SUDPX2"]}, "price": 17.98, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 185820}, "asin": "B00006G8H2", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51oeejPGaUL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Rocking Horse Winner"}

{"description": "The Forsyte Sagais often cited as the first television   miniseries; it wasn't, but there's no question that it was a singular, powerful  cultural phenomenon that deservedly got under the skin of European viewers in  1967 and changed the American TV landscape two years later. (Among other things,The Forsyte Sagabrought more viewers and extra clout to a then-struggling public television in the U.S., and gave rise to PBS'sMasterpiece  Theatre.)Today the 26-episode production, based on several novels and short stories by  John Galsworthy, is a more timeless enterprise than many of the protracted  British TV dramas that have followed. While it would be wrong to considerThe  Forsyte Sagahigh art, it's certainly a mesmerizing and inspired mix of  theater, sprawling Victorian narrative, thinking man's soap opera, and some  finely tuned, 1960s black-and-white production values that (especially when shot  outdoors) are strikingly handsome.Above all,Forsyteis driven by its characters--perhaps to an extreme,  though the two-generation storyline makes no apologies for creating compelling  people whose capacity for short-sighted blundering, bursts of grace, and  slow-brewing redemption make them recognizably human. Eric Porter towers over  everything as Soames Forsyte, a humorless attorney whose guiding principles of  measurable value cause great heartache but slowly evolve, leaving him a graying,  good father, arts patron, and sympathetic repository of memory. From the cast of  150 or so, other standouts include Susan Hampshire as Soames's troubled  daughter, Nyree Dawn Porter as the wife of two very different Forsyte men, and  Kenneth More as the  family's artistic black sheep.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00DW5ILF6", "B004H0ZHD4", "B0083HXKMC", "B008UQUS26", "B0002S648C", "B00BQXTDIU", "B004JMSIQS", "B0013NAMLK", "B009L2EW5W", "B005GP7ELW", "B005X5XIMO", "B004JMSIVI", "B00065GX96", "B000BNTMKK", "B001AXL67W", "B008KEQLW4", "B007701RFS", "B00HUAH14Q", "B004N66XYE", "B0090XUARQ", "B000E0ODZE", "B0080QOL10", "B000GIXLUC", "B00F1BFRA6", "B00018WENM", "B006JY3OHW", "B000PC6YUI", "B00JKEM36Q", "B000M2E32C", "B001GJ4U5A", "B000A8AXXG", "B0007LFPJ8", "B000784WNQ", "B002XTBECY", "B00EF0NVGQ", "B009T6CXG0", "B00005JOA0", "B001B1Q2UO", "B00B62R9XM", "B0009PVZIW", "B005T0OY5S", "B001JXPC7S", "B007A2O3FO", "B00008DDRZ", "B00141188M", "0199549893", "B00336M8DK", "B004EYT8BA", "B005N8KP3Q", "B00H4ZEFTQ", "B00HHYF5DE", "B00HYZ0ZLS", "B00HHYF548", "B000WVPXAO", "B00AZMFO6I", "B003WEAW18", "B00005YUNK", "B003CP1T50", "B00FPPQYXM", "B00E3UN66I", "B00065GVIO", "B000BITVAG", "B0054DPLUC", "B00A8KJMP6", "B00BDSRM4K", "B00006HAZH", "B000V1OUPE", "B000QGE86K", "B00BCXW106", "B009DS6YGO", "B0019BI1FA", "B0000AQS3P", "B003WEAVZK", "B00062IZ0Y", "B007ISJS1O", "B00006FHZE", "B000M2E32M", "B000056KMW", "B00D49YEHO", "B000G6BM0K", "B000EBD9VC", "B0028AEO0M", "B00A8KJLPM", "B0013K2ZGI", "B008F0QBO6", "B0050N0UYI", "B00ANGICCO", "B00J5LXT44", "B001PU8N0I", "B000089QEM", "B00015GA8A", "B004DK9DQ0", "B000E8QVAG", "B000FQIRXQ", "B00DUX28XQ", "B00GD7UMDO", "B0009PVZM8", "B00GSBMNOQ", "B000EMGF2Q", "B0013NAML0"], "bought_together": ["B00DW5ILF6", "B008UQUS26"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0083HXKMC", "B004H0ZHD4", "B00DW5ILF6", "B008UQUS26"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 71544}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 57.33, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00007149J", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Lt8Ma7j9L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Forsyte Saga - The Complete Series"}
{"description": "The mysteriousTime Outis a riveting film, despite (because of?) the fact that hardly anything happening in it corresponds to our notion of movie \"action.\" Vincent (Aur&#xE9;lien Recoing, a top French theater actor but cinematic newcomer) is an out-of-work family man living along the Swiss border. He's never told anyone he's lost his job with a U.N. bureau. He leaves home in the morning--when not working out of his (nonexistent) Geneva apartment--and does things like go to an all-glass office tower and hover as if he belonged. Vincent's excellent at seeming to belong; Recoing's performance is an uncanny symphony of collegial tics, benign watchfulness, and shy, tolerant shrugs. Eventually we gather that Vincent is running a swindle, the ease of which seems to quietly horrify him. However, the most unsettling thing about his fictional work posture is that we come to realize it's scarcely less genuine than, or different from, the shell game that is the real thing.--Richard T.

{"description": "A grainy, enigmatic videotape has the power to kill people seven days after they watch it. This brilliant premise fueled the 2002 Hollywood hitThe Ring, but before that it conquered Japan inRingu, Hideo Nakata's quietly unsettling study in terror. Fans of the U.S. version will find a less elaborate storyline and more primal fear in the original; the basic plot, however, still has a worried reporter (Nanako Matsushima) tracking down the meaning of the video--and, having watched it herself, she has only a week to work. The film's calm, economical style actually adds to the creeping sense of dread throughout, and the hair-curling set-pieces stand out in contrast. Like an old photograph of something evil,Ringuhas the strange-but-familiar power to unnerve. Guaranteed, its effect will linger for at least seven days.

{"description": "Kate Hudson twinkles as the heroine of How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days. She's a magazine writer assigned to date a guy, make all the mistakes girls make that drive guys away (being clingy, talking in baby-talk and so on) and records the process like a sociological experiment. However, the guy she picks-- Matthew McConaughey--is an advertising executive who's just bet that he can make a woman fall in love with him in 10 days; if he succeeds, he'll win a huge account that will make his career. The set-up is completely absurd, but the collision of their efforts to woo and repel creates some pretty funny scenes. McConaughey's easy charm and Hudson's lightweight impishness play well together and the plot, though strictly Hollywood formula, chugs along efficiently. At moments Hudson seems to channel her mother, Goldie Hawn, to slightly unnerving effect. --Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00007E2F5", "B00003CXSM", "B00AEFXWXI", "B0012KJ0DK", "B002K0WBXW", "B0015I2RT8", "B00164KYV4", "B004EPZ070", "B0000897EG", "B00447L4KA", "B002P413IC", "B00005JN3W", "B002ZG988M", "B000MQC9H4", "B002ZG989G", "B00AEBB8NS", "B000A343RI", "B001TUZD8O", "B00006ZXSL", "B00005O5CM", "B001OQCUZM", "B004EPZ0BG", "B00081U7HC", "B004SIP9X8", "B003Y5H574", "B001Y8DJVE", "6304765266", "B00008NRI7", "B000YDBPAM", "B0038N9X3Q", "B00AEBB8R4", "B00AEFYQE2", "B000683VI4", "B0000524E5", "B00AEBB9WI", "B00AEFXO8Q", "B00AEFYM2S", "B000YAA68C", "B00AMEZDJW", "B0007PLLBU", "B00006ZXSK", "B002ZG984Q", "B0009OL7Z4", "B002ZG9968", "B0036TGSIK", "B000023VTP", "B003BV8ICC", "B00AEFYWQY", "B00AEBB8YW", "B000J4QW7W", "B003B3V0N4", "B00005JG6N", "B0000DIXDR", "B004SEUJK0", "B005LAIGSM", "B000ELJAEM", "B0001Z3TXE", "B000957O82", "B001OQCUYI", "B004SIP9RO", "B004SIP8LG", "B003NHRIVQ", "B0013D8LHC", "B00AKGG6JS", "B00008WJD6", "B003Y5H524", "B000J103OI", "B0050MB584", "B00006ZXSO", "B00006FMUW", "B000HEWEE4", "6305236569", "B000XJD33O", "B002ZG99UE", "B0035Q637K", "B00466HN7M", "B001L9EXTS", "B00386EZKE", "B001C5LLQ4", "076780421X", "B000J3OTSM", "B000E6EHE0", "B004LWZW9C", "B00005JM55", "B000EMGICS", "B000CEV3KU", "B008JFUUIA", "B00003CXMP", "B000P0J0DS", "B000TZJBPQ", "B0000AOV4I", "B005Z9MFRC", "B0000D8L1K", "B000HCPS94", "B00E8RKHWW", "B00AEFY4CG", "B004SIP8JI", "B0001AVZA8", "B005LAIGXW", "B000Y7U93C"], "bought_together": ["B00007E2F5", "B002K0WBXW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002K0WBXW", "B002ZG989G", "B00007E2F5", "B00447L4KA"]}, "price": 14.16, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 346003}, "asin": "B00008KDGZ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/512083xZEbL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days"}

Sheridan LeFanu's \"Carmilla\"), Pitt's sensuous bloodsucker seduces Hammer starlets Madeleine Smith and Kate O'Mara and incurs the vengeful wrath of Peter Cushing.Countessis the more sober of the two films, with Jeremy Paul's script and Peter Sadsy's direction playing out more like an Old Dark House mystery than Hammer horror, whileLovers' aims for comic-book thrills with plenty of nudity and violence (much of which was trimmed from the American version, but reinstated here); in both cases, Pitt's sexy/scary performances make this DVD a memorably viewing experience for vintage and new-school horror fans alike.--Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0009X770O", "B00B94VJYW", "B001B9ZVVC", "B001B1Q3LM", "B00005NSXY", "B0000A9GHP", "B00456VHMA", "B003M8NGG2", "B008HSK3PE", "B00000F62P", "B00009PY4D", "B00009PY4A", "B008BWFOXM", "B000RXVNCO", "B0002KQNJU", "B0034PWPHY", "B00ITZXDDY", "B000K7VL56", "B000062XEY", "B0000694WH", "B002WJHBEA", "B000TGJ89E", "B00005KHJO", "B000068TPF", "B0001FVE5O", "B00005NKTH", "1848562292", "B0016LFUVQ", "B000UDGOBG", "B000TUDBGG", "B0009X770E", "B0007R4T0S", "B000RXVNCY", "B00FUABJJQ", "B0007R4SZY", "B00005AUK0", "B0001CNRLQ", "B000AM6OOY", "B000EHSVJG", "B0030VO0DO", "B00JDOQMH4", "B0007R4T26", "B00009PY45", "B005CVFZ4I", "B0016KCCCC", "B003THSXJ6", "6305334730", "B00005LC4J", "B00D9EJFV4", "B00DOZNGC2", "B000XCK0OQ", "B005ZHBDTK", "B00006G8JZ", "B001BSBBNK", "B004X63SCY", "B000068TPE", "B004KDYR20", "B0001FVEAY", "B000060MVD", "B00005LC4N", "B00GRZPRB4", "B000067DCX", "6305808198", "B000GRUQJW", "B00008973G", "B00D9EJFZA", "B00IARA8HU", "B000068TPD", "B008N2Z16A", "B00006JMQH", "B007UQ8IQU", "B005D0RDKM", "B00005R1O7", "B00AGKH714", "B002945DUW", "B00006G8K0"], "bought_together": ["B001B1Q3LM"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00ITZXDDY", "B00B94VJYW", "B00005NSXY", "B003M8NGG2"]}, "price": 59.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 70046}, "asin": "B00009PY48", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZWB2BNT7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Countess Dracula / The Vampire Lovers"}
{"description": "Irreversiblebegins with the closing credits running backwards before the film begins (or ends) with Marcus (Vincent Cassell) and Pierre (Albert Dupontel) being escorted out of a gay S&M; club by the cops, Marcus with his arm broken and Pierre in handcuffs. The \"story\" proceeds to unwind in a series of single-take scenes that unfoldMemento-style, with each scene giving more context to what we have seen previously.  Each scenario depicts actions, dialogue, incident, behavior, and circumstances that the lead characters might have wished didn't happen, ranging from extreme violence through awkward social situations to mild embarrassment. The central character (and possible dreamer of this whole what-if story) emerges as Alex (Monica Bellucci), who suffers the worst in a very hard-to-watch rape sequence in an underpass. Semi-improvised, the scenes all have attack and power as themes, with later/earlier conversational sequences that suggest life isn't all sexual assaults in the dark, showing equal cinematic imagination with the horrors. Arguably, this is not a film most would subject themselves to twice, but it is something that stays in the mind for days after viewing, sparking far more ideas and emotions than most wallow-in-nastiness pictures.--Kim Newman", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005K9O8", "B001MEJY8W", "B00GGY4R3K", "B0048LPRCS", "B001B187L6", "B00125WATQ", "B00003CXXY", "B000FWHW68", "B0048LPRD2", "B002EOVXBK", "B000GI3RHY", "B0014VPFVS", "B003KGBISE", "B003VL3UR0", "B000WMEE9E", "B000WC38EQ", "B000L6S92E", "B0006JMLVQ", "B0082A3HFK", "B005ER6STG", "B00003JRAV", "B00375LBKI", "B001AZKB8K", "B00699G622", "B0040QYRT0", "B00006FDBW", "B0000CABGW", "B00GRZPRB4", "B004BLTNM0", "B000UW8596", "B0009WFEDC", "B004C00EM8", "B0007TZHWA", "B000ARFPMQ", "B005SQRYB4", "B003B2UK1S", "B006UGWDXU", "B00DMUFXOS", "B00JVQ7QTM", "6305228876", "B003L20IEM", "B0032D5ESA", "B00BSU0FQA", "B002EOVXCY", "B001JV5BIA", "B0060AAMEI", "B0000AQS1H", "B002R3CQDC", "B005IGVTM4", "B004LXBKEC", "B003KGBISO", "B00005JMIJ", "B000IMVE32", "B008G1JIQC", "B00006LPER", "B00005U14H", "B00699G6AE", "B001C5LLVE", "B0041KKYCY", "B0043X1FEU", "B00EOBB7LC", "B009OCR2U6", "B000HXDWNM", "B0002DB52M", "B001VG2MAI", "B002C8YSCE", "B0000BWVCR", "B00HW3EJ6Y", "B00AYGVCCK", "B000I8OMEY", "B00023P4I8", "B0009S2T0M", "B003Y5H5G0", "B00LLAV26O", "B00GPPXNIK", "B000X1RYEQ", "B00000IC7G", "B004XZ99FK", "B006Z7Z3VS", "B001PYD0LQ", "B00GPPXNQ2", "B004P2VQZ2", "B001FOK70S", "B00DI67YCU", "B00K0MM4AM", "B0009VRHLK", "B00006FMCS", "B000BGH29K", "B003L20IEC", "B000AC7P5Q", "B0002KPHZG", "B001AIQ14A", "B00APUAKYG", "B00AY6PK5A", "B00284BNKC", "B006OB3K56"], "bought_together": ["B001MEJY8W", "B00GGY4R3K"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001MEJY8W", "B00GGY4R3K", "B0048LPRCS", "B001B187L6"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 33569}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 10.13, "brand": "LION&#39;S GATE ENTERTAINMENT", "asin": "B00009W0U4", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41GBWP82KQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Irreversible"}

{"description": "What wouldLate Nightbe like if David Letterman was replaced by a superhero? That's the question posited by the Cartoon Network's original seriesSpace Ghost Coast to Coast, and the answer is: truly odd and frequently hilarious. The series took '60s-era animated crime fighter Space Ghost and reinvented him as the slightly addled host of a celebrity gabfest. SG's awkward chats with guests like David Byrne, Hulk Hogan, and the Ramones were frequently interrupted by his old foes Zorak (now the show's bandleader) and Moltar (director). Deliberately stilted and proudly absurd, the program was a strange but often dead-on parody of hollow celebrity worship, and garnered a loyal cult following. However, those diehard fans may be disappointed by this two-disc set, which features only 16 of the 22 episodes from the first three seasons (a clip from one missing episode, \"A Space Ghost Christmas,\" is included in the supplemental features). Also somewhat of a letdown is the commentary from the show's creative team, which is amusing but rarely informative.--Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0002WZRTU", "B0007CILMK", "B00069L0YU", "B0007CILMA", "B0001MZ7K0", "B000GIXLWA", "B00069L0Z4", "B00097DY2U", "B000FO0AFQ", "B000FO0AG0", "B000PAAJZG", "B00116GEKW", "B0000AQS81", "B0002WZRSG", "B0001MZ7KA", "B002GSXKRO", "B001G7Q640", "B000B5XOR0", "B001EOQVA4", "B000VWX6SA", "B00330WP6Q", "B004L9GLM2", "B000ARXF7I", "B000G0O596", "B000EMGIDC", "B003NF97NU", "B0056EBHEI", "B00008EY6Q", "B000ABKHZC", "B00267N3EU", "B00113YHXG", "B001J4E1C4", "B000M341RS", "B0002YCVY2", "B000OY9V7A", "B00466HOR6", "B0069R250G", "B003BV8I9K", "B00GSSD73K", "B000CSUNMK", "B000M7XRC4", "B003VVBZ7W", "B000E0OE3K", "B001BGS17G", "B00000344C", "B000S76LKI", "B000GG4Y1Y", "B0048LPRDC", "B0081QCZGC", "B004MA1K1M", "B003H0ZHLW", "B002N1AEWS", "B0091JQ6N6", "B00C6QT4CQ", "B002ZXZJ1A", "B0002NY8XA", "B000RPD0DC", "B007CO5MVE", "B004QLX0TM", "B000OY9V7K", "B001SER4LA", "B00AIANIPQ", "B001NOMO2Y", "B006KCZBK6", "B002T4GXUQ", "B001P7YD7S", "B000CQQID0", "B0017RFXJI", "B00553KAK2", "B001NOMO38", "B003SLEDL0", "B001G8SX04", "B000ERVJNG", "B00475B0G2", "B00080ZFYS", "B000FZETJS", "B000FI9OEU", "B0001HAI0E", "B0017INRG8", "B000F48D14", "B005CHTXWC", "B001DZOD7C", "B001GU04Y0", "B0007VY40E", "B0026KJP6W", "B008KHJJ9I", "B0019N8P2W", "B0008KLV96", "B00466HORQ", "B000EBGE9Q", "B0025X4PBK", "B007CU8P8K", "B000EQ5PT6", "B000FS9MUQ", "B004RCGQSC", "B000FEBWTE"], "bought_together": ["B0002WZRTU", "B0007CILMK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0007GADU4", "B0007CILMK", "B0002WZRTU", "B0001MZ7K0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 60060}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 19.09, "brand": "TURNER HM ENTERTAINM", "asin": "B0000AQS89", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51yEhWdZWmL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Space Ghost Coast to Coast - Volume One"}

{"description": "For years, animation buffs have waited impatiently for the Warner Bros.  cartoons to appear on DVD. The Warner shorts never commanded the budgets and  prestige of the Disney and MGM films, and won fewer Oscars than they deserved. But  decades after the best ones were created, they remain the quintessential  Hollywood cartoons: brash, fast-paced, aggressively funny and uniquely American.  Virtually everyone in the U.S. under the age of 60 grew up on these films, in  theaters and on TV. The 56 cartoons in the set (out of a studio output of over 1,000) were  transferred from good prints--which means the viewer can see dust, scratches, and  occasional mistakes by the cel painters. The films are all presented uncut, in  defiance of the killjoys who have insisted on censoring alleged \"violence\" in  the versions shown on television. Warner Bros. is obviously testing consumer response with this set. Although  the erratic selection includes many classics, purists will argue (correctly)  that it offers neither a fair representation of the directors'oeuvres,  nor anything approaching a coherent history of the characters or studio style.   (Nearly half the films were directed by Chuck Jones; only three are by Bob  Clampett, and there's nothing by Tex Avery or Frank Tashlin.)  But it seems petty to carp about omissions and biases when the discs offer  excellent, uncensored prints of some of the funniest films ever made in the  U.S.--or anywhere else.

{"description": "Three generations of the Douglas clan--old-time star Kirk, Michael ofFatal AttractionandWonder Boys, and movie newcomer Cameron--star inIt Runs in the Family. Alex Gromberg (Michael) is a high-powered lawyer who works for a firm co-founded by his father Mitchell (Kirk), who's recovering from a stroke, while Alex's son Asher (Cameron) is dealing pot and flunking out of his senior year in college. The movie moves between the three men's relationships with women and each other. Surprisingly,It Runs in the Familyisn't as much of a vanity project as it seems; though some implausible elements serve only to flatter the stars (wealthy lawyer Alex volunteers at a soup kitchen for the homeless, where a babelicious co-worker throws herself at him), most of the script is solidly written and the parent-child conflicts ring true.

{"description": "What better way to cap off 2003, the \"Year of the Blues,\" than with this eminently watchable documentary about Chester A. Burnett, better known as Howlin' Wolf? Arguably second only to Muddy Waters among the Mississippi Delta singers who traveled north and pioneered urban electric blues (their supposed rivalry is the subject of one of this DVD's bonus features), Wolf was a big, imposing man with an inimitable, booming voice and a lasting influence on generations of rock & rollers--all of which comes across in the 90-minute film. Not only do we get a history of his life (told by family members, musical associates like longtime guitarist Hubert Sumlin, and Wolf himself) that's far more entertaining than the norm for this genre, we also get some history of the blues in general. And not only do we hear snippets of Wolf's music, we hear several complete songs, including some priceless filmed performances. Quite simply, this one should become a touchstone for documentaries of its kind.--Sam Graham", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000050IKX", "B00009VU35", "B000OPP7LS", "B000BM7U82", "B0000AYL2M", "B0000AYL2N", "B000TM1C2Y", "B0030CNO62", "B0001XAMH2", "1560256834", "B001P3SA94", "B0002KP54E", "B0007R8FOE", "0140062238", "B0000CBHOI", "B00078RPGW", "B000002OAZ", "B007JQY9G4", "157330087X", "B0085KGHI6", "B000O5905M", "B000065U3M", "B0002A2WDQ", "B005CDBTAA", "B00IPL286U", "B000002O3I", "B000067NPL", "B000067NPO", "0316164941", "B00DNJ99F2", "B000F0UTTM", "B00H3JHH6Q", "B0012GMWCU", "B000005KQN", "B003KUSUE0", "B000002OCK", "0306807432", "B0000C0FHN", "B0001I2BQC", "B00FLDG52I", "B001JIR3KC", "B000002OBL", "1565847393", "B004VFYNRQ", "0060524278", "0062061038", "B00ILAWJLO", "B000UB054U", "B0012GMWIE", "B00IYLX4B4", "6305019681", "B000005KQT", "B00005NHLY", "B0012GMUW2", "B00G2DC2EG", "B001P3SA8U", "B000UD2K32", "B00377V6J2", "B00JDB4D3M", "0306819570", "B0056NYERG", "B00JZO33VK", "B00HZMRZYA", "B0001MDPAY", "B00005R8GU", "B000FBHCBY", "B0012GMWIO", "B00007KK1Q", "B000UCWK1U", "B004B3PBEC", "B004G6TD20", "0306812967", "B000PSJDQ4", "B00H3JHE0K", "B004OFWLO0", "0415937116", "B001JL2VCE", "B0002SPPSC", "B00008J2HC", "0316328499", "0195398939", "0306804158", "B000JBXHWI", "B000002OC1", "B00K0NAOJY", "B000002877", "B004I5W55G", "B000002P4B", "157330056X", "177152006X", "6305610460", "B00004Z3VB", "B004FOJHRY", "B000005KQM", "B0012GMUZY", "B00IK7NC9G", "B000QFAFPY", "B00006JOCR", "B00004TJF1", "B00FLDG5BE"], "bought_together": ["B000050IKX", "B00009VU35"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000050IKX", "B0002A2WDQ", "B000OPP7LS", "B00009VU35"]}, "price": 13.98, "categories": [["CDs & Vinyl", "Blues"], ["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 55110}, "asin": "B0000DJZ81", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51txssHnrYL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Howlin' Wolf Story - The Secret History of Rock &amp; Roll"}
{"description": "Who knew Luke Skywalker was such a geek? As the director-coproducer-star ofComic Book: The Movie,Star Warsveteran Mark Hamill embraces his inner nerd and pays affectionate tribute to those who are attracted (either casually or obsessively) to the fantastical realms of comic books. As \"Don Swan,\" high school teacher, lifelong comic collector, and microbudget filmmaker, Hamill joins legions of fans at San Diego's epic-scale ComiCon International (the world's largest sci-fi/comic convention), on a mission to thwart a dubious Hollywood makeover of Captain Courage, his favorite \"Golden Age\" comic superhero. Hamill's experiment in \"mockumentary\" is unscripted, haphazard, not very funny, and a bit too \"inside\" for mass appeal, but its spontaneous spirit hides a worthy agenda that any fan can relate to: While exploring the lively atmosphere of ultimate fandom,Comic Book: The Movieinvestigates the schism between Hollywood and fandom that results, too often, in lackluster big-screen adventures for beloved comic-book characters. By recruiting a cast of prominent cartoon-voice talent (like himself), in addition to an all-star list of comic-artist cameos including Stan Lee, Matt Groening, and many others, Hamill has crafted a casual yet thoroughly researched portrait of one of America's most vibrant subcultures.

{"description": "Despite critical barbs as sharp as a Maroobi spear,Gilligan's Islandhas proven unsinkable. Its first season was 1964's top-rated show. The expository theme song is one of television's most quoted, and its characters--the Skipper (Alan Hale Jr.), first mate Gilligan (Bob Denver), the millionaire (Jim Backus) and his wife (Natalie Schaefer), a movie star (Tina Louise), \"and the rest\" (Russell Johnson and Dawn Wells, as the Professor and Mary Ann, wouldn't get their opening credit props until season two)--are pop culture icons. Revisiting the first season's 36 episodes is a not-guilty-at-all pleasure. Some sure and surprising hands piloted these inaugural episodes, including Ida Lupino, Jack Arnold (The Creature from the Black Lagoon), Christian Nyby (The Thing), and Richard Donner (who went on to directSupermanandLethal Weapon).The \"seven stranded castaways\" from the ill-fated S.S.Minnow(slyly named for former Federal Communications Commission head Newton \"vast wasteland\" Minow) received memorable visits from the likes of Hans Conreid as errant pilot Wrong Way Feldman, a young Kurt Russell as Jungle Boy, and Larry Storch as a Cagney-esque bank robber.  But these were mere diversions from the heart of the series; the no-man-is-an-island social microcosm that creator Sherwood Schwartz conceived as an anti-war parable (this courtesy of his optional commentary during the fabled unaired series pilot). In the Christmas episode \"Birds Gotta Fly, Fish Gotta Talk,\" Santa Claus himself drops in to lift the disheartened castaways' spirits. \"You could have been enemies,\" he tells them, \"instead of a family group who all learned to get along.\" This is they key to this series' enduring popularity.

{"description": "Based on the bestseller by John Grisham,Runaway Juryis a slick thriller that's exciting enough to overcome the gaps in its plot. The ultimate target has been changed: Grisham's legal assault on the tobacco industry was switched to the hot-button issue of gun control (no doubt to avoid comparison toThe Insider) in a riveting expos&#xE9; of jury-tampering. Gene Hackman plays the ultra-cynical, utterly unscrupulous pawn of the gun-makers, using an expert staff and advanced electronics to hand-pick a New Orleans jury that will return a favorable verdict; Dustin Hoffman (making his first screen appearance with real-life former roommate Hackman) defends the grieving widow of a gun-shooting victim with idealistic zeal, while maverick juror John Cusack and accomplice Rachel Weisz play both ends against the middle in a personal quest to hold gun-makers accountable. It's riveting stuff, even when it's obvious that Grisham and director Gary Fleder have glossed over any details that would unravel the plot's intricate design.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783226942", "B000P5FH3K", "B002NZK5R8", "B00AEFXYJA", "B002NZK5UU", "0767810872", "B002NZK5VO", "B0000694XY", "630542828X", "B00AEFXT1S", "B0006HBZBA", "B0045HCJ8K", "B0000C3I8M", "B004EPYZP8", "B0010YSD7W", "B00096S49Y", "B000063US3", "B000R4SMCW", "1558908382", "B001NY4WYC", "B003ASLJIQ", "6305428115", "B00005B6JZ", "B00005JL8F", "B00005UQ9T", "B00008EY9G", "B00008K77D", "0800141806", "B00005JPT0", "B00003CXFV", "B000P0I4O4", "B000CEV3M8", "B00441GYPG", "0790732149", "B000SFOW8I", "B000TJ6PBK", "0783240295", "B001I2EQUY", "B000055Y0Y", "B000NTMA0Q", "B002O3Z4ZW", "B002AT8KAG", "0790730979", "B00003CY5G", "B0038Z5T4Q", "B004SIP9RO", "B004YCKKFK", "B002AS464Q", "B00AMSM9DG", "0783226888", "B00AADAK5W", "B0031OCY2E", "B002DU39GW", "B00000K3TU", "B002LMV7R0", "B0013D8LBS", "B000GFLKF8", "B000CEXEWA", "B00008L3S6", "B00005ATZT", "B00AEBB9UK", "6304806434", "B002AT8K9W", "B00AEFXEGS", "B003ASLJQ8", "B0043X1FNQ", "B000BNX3B4", "B001CC7PLM", "B002QW7AMG", "B000JYW5BE", "B000Y11B8U", "B001HVZOB6", "B00BLN4UKQ", "B005NKIPUY", "B00015YVDG", "B00H91LWDC", "0792844874", "6305657947", "B003L20IG0", "0780618548", "B00DWZHTOU", "B003Q6D2B4", "B000ENC5YW", "B00GUO2SKA", "B0010YVCB6", "B00009WVSL", "B000G5SILC", "B000F8DV1M", "B00FQRZ6EM", "B000OYAT3U", "B00AEFXIIW", "B008JFURII", "B00005JNQA", "B002O3Z4XY", "B000059XTK", "B00005JN5E", "B001ECDVK4", "B000K7VHQ4", "B00000JGHL"], "bought_together": ["B000P5FH3K", "0783226942"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001I2EQUY", "B000P5FH3K", "B00AEFXYJA", "B002NZK5VO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 38867}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.67, "brand": "Twentieth Century Fox", "asin": "B00014NEZI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51X52Z0CBSL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Runaway Jury (Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "Hayao Miyazaki gained widespread attention in Japan for his complex ecological manga series,Nausica&#xE4; of the Valley of the Wind(1982), which he adapted for the screen two years later. One thousand years after a war devastated much of the Earth, humanity clings to existence at the fringes of a vast, polluted forest inhabited by monstrous insects. Only Nausica&#xE4;, the princess of the tiny realm of the Valley of the Wind, grasps the environmental significance of the forest. She sees beyond petty wars and national rivalries to the only viable future for the planet. InNausica&#xE4;, Miyazaki began to explore elements he would develop more fully in his later films: daring, compassionate heroines; exciting flying sequences; colorful side characters; strong interpersonal relationships; and a call for an ecologically sustainable way of life. Nausica&#xE4; prefigures Sheeta inCastle in the Skyand Chihiro inSpirited Away, just as the rough and ready Asbel anticipates Pazu inCastle in the Skyand Ashitaka inPrincess Mononoke. For years,Nausica&#xE4;was available in the United States only as the badly re-editedWarriors of the Wind.

{"description": "Cyndi Lauper may talk like Edith Bunker (or any number of other queens from Queens), but she sure doesn't sing like her. Indeed, two decades after she burst on the pop scene with herShe's So Unusualalbum, Lauper's voice is arguably stronger than ever--an opinion borne out inLive... At Last, a 16-song, 112-minute concert recorded in New York in March, 2004 (the title references both her'03 CD of the same nameand the fact that this is her first concert video since 1987'sCyndi Lauper in Paris). Unlike, say, such understated chanteuses as Norah Jones and Diana Krall, Lauper likes to wail, and if the result is occasionally somewhat over the top, it still makes for powerful performances of such familiar material as \"I Drove All Night,\" \"All Through the Night,\" and her biggest hits, \"Time After Time\" and the salsa-flavored \"Girls Just Want to Have Fun.\" Indeed, Lauper is at her best when she simply rocks (the punkish \"It's Hard to Be Me\" is another highlight). Far less successful are the mannered, ponderous, and/or melodramatic arrangements of pop standards like \"Walk On By,\" \"If You Go Away,\" and \"Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood,\" while the French caf&#xE9; vibe on \"She Bop\" is cute but insubstantial. The visuals (shot in high definition and viewed in widescreen) and audio are excellent, while bonus features include Lauper's guided tour of Queens.--Sam Graham", "related": {"also_bought": ["B005ISRAEI", "B0000028CD", "143914785X", "B00452J51E", "B00009V7PJ", "B003HTPHSQ", "B00008PX8X", "B00452J5AU", "B0046QK9TQ", "B001RTP436", "B00064VR0W", "B0012GMWNO", "B0028R3G5O", "B001725ZB4", "B0017WI5JI", "B0000A02WV", "B000BU0C70", "B0000E2FLC", "B00K0HDE7Y", "B007OAAK0O", "B00005QBZD", "B000021Y7Q", "B003XMKMZU", "B0001ENXYA", "B00JPXAO5E", "B003UPPO2G", "B00FTGYNUS", "B00008H2I9", "B0000584ZV", "B0002CTSY0", "B001Y7SIOI", "B00J0LH0XK", "630463949X", "B00023P4B0", "B00005RT35", "B000F48D00", "B0001Z3632", "B0000DG7C0", "B00HNTUR6S", "B00005R1NY", "B0053TWVFA", "B009DT9ANW", "B004Z1HYAE", "B000F8O49A", "B007KLEHUQ", "B0000AVHDC", "B0003035CW", "B0000071IP", "B0002IQI2Y", "B00FEXL3OA", "6305603898", "B002PLALCO", "B006T8KT5S", "B0000TB03W", "B002ZFQD04", "B0030BOCE6", "B003BUAOZ2", "B009DH372Y", "B0000028QO", "B0007Z0VVQ", "6304498977", "B000YEUUCK", "6305019681", "B000BC8STM", "B0000C2IUI", "B000NL51D2", "157330039X", "B00AU15GLC", "B000B5Y0JG", "B000BHHVPO", "B00064AEOC", "B000001E0D", "B000056HOZ", "B005SV9X22", "B00I5NKPWC", "B008B3MZMY", "B000KGGLCU", "B000FGG738", "B00008HCB8", "B004GJYR8W", "B000BVNY3S", "B00DZILTZO", "B006T8KT3U", "B00005V1WV", "B002LMOAUQ", "B000I0QLUA", "B003ICWTR4", "B000NA223K", "B000VKL6UW", "B000A2RRF4", "B000UX6TRK", "B000H7JCI2", "B0002GTX8M", "B00068C7VQ", "B00067BBQO", "B00BRN2RVE", "B000V7FZ7K", "B000CRSDM8", "B0018M6J72", "B00CIOG15E"], "bought_together": ["B005ISRAEI", "B0000028CD"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00452J51E", "B0028R3G5O", "B005ISRAEI", "B0000028CD"]}, "price": 13.75, "categories": [["CDs & Vinyl", "Alternative Rock", "New Wave & Post-Punk", "New Wave"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Pop", "Vocal Pop"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Rock"], ["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 124554}, "asin": "B00023BJFU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41P5FXCHC0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Cyndi Lauper - Live...

{"description": "The cutting wit of Tina Fey (the first female head writer forSaturday Night Live) brilliantly fuses pop culture and smart satire. Fey wroteMean Girls, in which a formerly home-schooled girl named Cady (Lindsay Lohan) gets dropped into the sneaky, vicious world of the Plastics, three adolescent glamour-girls who dominate their public high school's social hierarchy. Cady first befriends a couple of art-punk outsiders who persuade her to infiltrate the Plastics and destroy them from within--but power corrupts, and Cady soon finds the glory of being a Plastic to be seductive.Mean Girlsjoins the ranks ofClueless,Bring It On, andHeathers, cunning movies that use the hormone-pressurized high school milieu to put the dark impulses of human nature--ambition, envy, lust, revenge--under a comic microscope. Fey manages to skewer everyone without forgetting the characters' hapless humanity; it's a dazzling and delightful balancing act.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEFXO8Q", "B0036TGSIK", "B00AEBB8R4", "B00AEFYMBO", "B008JFUUIA", "B00005JMCW", "B000J4QW7W", "B00003CXMP", "B00005O5CM", "B00466HN7M", "B00441GYVK", "B00005JN0Z", "B0018CNNV2", "B00447L4KA", "B00AG473GE", "B001AEF6BS", "B003Y5H574", "B00AEFXXMI", "B00008K7AM", "B000CEV3KU", "B00006ZXSL", "B001AEF6BI", "B001OQCUYI", "B0000DIXDR", "B0053TWVQ4", "B00AEFY99O", "B003NHRIVQ", "B00AEBBA2M", "B000GB775E", "B001BL96K2", "B00E8RKHWW", "B004SIP9X8", "B00AEFXUXU", "B001H1I8KK", "B0007LXPBI", "B0007LXPBS", "B006X08DZ0", "B00001PE4D", "B000324Y98", "B006TTC50Y", "B000YAA68C", "B00002SSKI", "B000P0J0A6", "B002GIBVQ6", "6305428425", "B00000F0AD", "B00164KYV4", "B00007E2F5", "B000FCW15A", "B0035Q637K", "B000683VI4", "B003Y5H52O", "B00005JM55", "B00062IVN0", "B00005MEVO", "B00AEFY5TI", "B004EPYZU8", "B0002VYOVI", "B001MM3AZM", "B004EPZ0BG", "B00AMEZDJW", "B005Z9MFRC", "B000J103OI", "B000FS9MXI", "B0041KKYGU", "B0007PALZ2", "B004P7CN7W", "B000P0J09W", "6302077818", "B00005JNBQ", "B003TY2SWC", "B00AEBB9F0", "B002ZG989G", "B001UV4XUG", "0783235070", "B002ZG9968", "B000A2X3U2", "B004EPZ084", "B002DOBGWM", "B00AEFXZJE", "B0001I563M", "B0009OL7Z4", "B00028HBES", "B00404ME2Y", "B002ZG976U", "B003B3V0N4", "B0007PLLBU", "B000AM4P9A", "B005LAII12", "B002K0WBXW", "B00AEFXE9U", "B000Z8GZYW", "B00AEFYQE2", "B003B1X85O", "B00081U7HC", "B00AEFY0F2", "B003Y5H5B0", "B000YDBPAM", "B00004Y2R1", "B0006TPE4C"], "bought_together": ["B00AEFXO8Q"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B008JFUUIA", "B0036TGSIK", "B00AEBB8R4", "B00466HN7M"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 81958}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.97, "brand": "Paramount", "asin": "B0002IQJ8W", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510H7MK4TXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Mean Girls (Widescreen Edition)"}

When this wacky habit enters adulthood and begins wrecking their lives, they ought to change... but that's not how l'amour fou works. PartAmelie-style comedy, part dark fable, this movie has quirkiness to burn, if not always as much charm as it thinks it has.

{"description": "The unprecedented resurrection ofFamily Guydisproves Neil Young's maxim that \"Once you're gone, you can never come back.\" Unceremoniously canceled in 2002, the irreverent animated series proved to be a phenomenal seller on DVD, prompting not only a rerun revival on basic cable,  but also a new season. For those who have only recently made the acquaintance of the dysfunctional Griffins, this five-episode sampler is representative of the series' \"nothing is sacred\" comic universe. Creator Seth MacFarlane chose well: \"When You Wish Upon a Weinstein,\" which was banned during the series' original run; \"Lethal Weapons\"; \"To Live and Die in Dixie\"; \"I Am Peter, Hear Me Roar\"; and \"Road to Rhode Island.\" In addition to the restoration of a previously censored gag involving Osama Bin Laden in \"Rhode Island,\" what does this collection bring to the party for theFamily Guyfan who has everything? Four new episode commentaries, the best of which features MacFarlane in character as chain-smoking, martini swilling, talking dog Brian, and megalomaniacal infant Stewie for \"Rhode Island.\" There is also an interview with MacFarlane about why he chose these episodes, and a fitfully amusing sneak peak at MacFarlane's new series,American Dad.

{"description": "Here's some grisly good news for fear fans: the first season of HBO's long-running TV horror anthologyTales from the Crypt, based on the notorious '50s-era E.C. comic books, emerges on DVD in a two-disc set that's sure to have 'em shrieking (with joy, of course). Shepherded by a host of top Hollywood producers and directors (including Joel Silver, Richard Donner, Robert Zemeckis, and Walter Hill), theTales from the Cryptseries brought together major talent both in front of and behind the camera to give life to E.C.'s over-the-top stories of gruesome revenge and ghastly terror. Season 1 offers six star-studded spooktaculars, including Donner's \"Dig That Cat&#x85; He's Real Gone,\" withThe Sopranos' Joe Pantoliano as a carnival performer with a knack for surviving horrible endings; Zemeckis's \"And All Through the House,\" with Larry Drake as a homicidal Santa Claus terrorizing a woman who has just killed her husband (this story was also adapted in the 1972 theatrical version ofCrypt); and Hill's \"The Man Who Was Death,\" featuring a topnotch performance by William Sadler as a jailhouse executioner who takes the law into his own hands. Comic purists may decry liberties taken by updating the original stories (and current audiences may find elements in some episodes out of date, most notably Mary Lambert's \"Only Sin Deep\"), but the blend of gore and black humor should keep most horror heads happy, as should the chattering presence of the animatronic Crypt Keeper (well-voiced by John Kassir), who serves as the show's ghost host.The two-disc set's chief extra is an interesting documentary about the original comics, featuring interviews with co-editor Al Feldstein and legendary artist Jack Davis, as well as directors and authors inspired by the comics like George Romero, John Carpenter, and R.L. Stine. The Crypt Keeper also weighs in with a new intro for the DVD, as well as his reminiscences of the first-season episodes, complete with plenty of behind-the-scenes production photos. In short, pleasant screams are ensured for all.--Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000A88EU0", "B000E1MXWS", "B000FFJYC0", "B000P0J0E2", "B000SULWKO", "B000GYI322", "B003NKU9XM", "B006BZ8NSE", "B001LM64VA", "B002GHHHG0", "B00L89VL96", "B000RXVNCO", "B000Q66Q56", "B002HK9HZU", "B004SUDQCW", "B0053TWV46", "B00BTYPW7C", "B003VJTGMU", "B00363WGIM", "B0000AOX0C", "B002JHD9D2", "B000N2HD6Y", "B00AGKH714", "B00005JOJE", "B0000AOX0B", "B00HRCBGRA", "B00AEBB91O", "B003VJTGNE", "B0007CEXUY", "B000IMUYJM", "B000FFJZO2", "B00013D54Y", "B002EP8FDI", "B0007WQHI0", "157347049X", "B00005UQ9I", "B002XD0J80", "B0009YCLBS", "B002LMSWN2", "B000RIWAV2", "B00CBFB8WG", "B0024FAG44", "6305972001", "B00006FDCD", "B0002O7XW2", "B000I2J68M", "B000WC3864", "B001DXS4DI", "B0002VYOVS", "B000GYI340", "B000RIWAVW", "B00ARWX9NG", "B000053UIF", "1573625779", "B002I41KNC", "B001B8XRT6", "B00HRUQB8Q", "B00006FDCU", "6305645574", "B00BCMT1PK", "B001B1UO6W", "B00005KH30", "B00GSMZ3I8", "B000RL21N6", "B00005N5RM", "B00HRUQ8X4", "B009IV2Z7S", "B000068IEV", "B009IV2Z3M", "B005J9ZFQG", "B003PIUINI", "B008DVJOQ4", "B00009PY4G", "B000V4UFZK", "B0002NY8XA", "B000000HQ1", "B0053TWVIM", "B000CR76U8", "B0000694WL", "B000FEBWTE", "B000IFQLLE", "B004KDYR20", "B000Q66Q8I", "B00005O439", "B000WC389G", "B0002IQLH6", "B008R52L3Y", "B0001ZX0GK", "B0009X7650", "B00A429Y56", "B008JFUNYG", "B0002S9QUA", "B002K0WBX2", "B000U1ZV6W", "B003VE9WP6", "B00919THZU", "B000ERVJNG", "B00DOZNGTK", "B00009MEC4"], "bought_together": ["B000A88EU0", "B000E1MXWS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0030E5PYO", "B003NKU9XM", "B000A88EU0", "B006BZ8NSE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 85757}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 10.0, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B0009ETCOW", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51D2iWduZFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Tales from the Crypt: Season 1"}

{"description": "In the realm of revenge thrillers, you'd be hard pressed to find more ultra-violent vengeance and psycho thrills than in the creepy story ofOldboy. This Korean import made a pop splash at the Cannes Film Festival and during its limited theatrical run thanks to the imprimatur of Quentin Tarantino, who raved about it and its visionary director, Chan-wook Park, to anyone who would listen. It's easy to see why QT fell in love with the grindhouse attitude, fast-paced action, violent imagery, and icy-black humor, but it's a disservice to think ofOldboyas another Tarantino homage or knockoff. The darkly existential undercurrent in the themes thatOldboytraces over its life-long narrative arc is much more complex and deeply disturbing than anything of its kind. The movie's tagline is, \"15 years of imprisonment... 5 days of vengeance.\" The imprisonee is Oh Dae-Su, an ordinary Joe who is snatched off a Seoul street corner and locked away in a dank, windowless fleabag hotel room for the aforementioned 15 years. Just as abruptly he is released, and thus the five days begin. Why did this happen to Oh Dae-Su? Ah, but that would be telling, and in fact we don't know ourselves until the final wrenching scenes.Oldboybreaks into a classic three-act saga, the first of which details the hallucinatory period of imprisonment in which Oh Dae-Su wades from mild insanity to outright psychosis in the hands of unseen yet attentive captors. Act 2 is the revenge, when an entirely different tone takes over and Oh Dae-Su moves with single-minded purpose and clarity. It's this section that has gained the most notoriety, primarily for the claw-hammer dentistry scene, the one-man-army tracking shot, and the wriggling octopus that Oh Dae-Su consumes in a sushi bar (he's been dead so long he simply needs life back inside him in any way possible). In act 3, answers finally start to emerge and the sinister atmosphere grows even more profound--not without a healthy dose of extra bloodletting, of course.Oldboyis an undeniably poetic masterpiece of tension, fury, and dynamic craft. Ultimately, its epic cycle of tragedy is of the sort that mankind has been inflicting upon itself for all time. Some of the images may be gruesome, but all converge into a kind of beauty. It's in the telling of this lurid tale that these details become one and the memories of pain ultimately heal.--Ted Fry", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000BGH2A4", "B000GBEWNY", "B004P2VQZ2", "B00GMV8IVE", "B002P7UCJK", "B006L4MWVE", "B003Y7F1IW", "B004H2CXBQ", "B000GSYRY6", "B0000CABGW", "B0009WFEDC", "B003JDQJM8", "B003NLE5JA", "B000GSE6H4", "B0085A9J18", "B004XQO8MS", "B00C6WHPO4", "B000CRR3ME", "B00J5LXST0", "B0009XRZQK", "B0006VL1J2", "B00HOGBXS6", "B005X7HA6C", "B00CG0YLS4", "B001I82RVS", "B006C1S1DY", "B0013D8LBI", "B001MEJY8W", "B00IKM5OCO", "B0009NZ78I", "B00JJ3EHCG", "1593075685", "B000PKG8TW", "B005B0ZF3Q", "B0036BDQBU", "B001570H5K", "B0034G4P30", "B000I0RNWU", "B00HI9QGWC", "B008OTTVC2", "B00003CXZ4", "B000N6TX1I", "B00IA1VQBS", "B00IKM5MIA", "B00GMV8IGO", "B00005JN7C", "B006L4MWTQ", "B00J5LXTUI", "B00A3TFMDI", "B00003CXUM", "B005ZMBEXU", "B00HEPC0TS", "B00G3HCG9M", "B00005JNJR", "B00E1LNDDU", "B00005K9O8", "B0064NTZQ2", "B00GMV8M2Y", "B00DPUB56U", "B000MEYKCI", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B00AIBZMD6", "B00125WATQ", "B00009W0U4", "B00EI3XAZC", "B008JFUN50", "B004SIP6GI", "B000NA28GG", "B004P2VQXO", "B0000633R6", "B00JA3RVG4", "B00008975Z", "B00H9HZITU", "B000065V38", "B00DPUB5EW", "B008G1JIQC", "B0000CC885", "B004P2VQXE", "B003KGBISE", "B005Y1B3EW", "B00005RYKV", "B0048LPRCS", "B00JJ3EH6C", "B0000AVHAO", "B00HSJ2EMI", "B00JVQ7PWU", "B00GMV8HX8", "B0055T3RSS", "B00G4Q3KOC", "B00GMV8L1Q", "B0040QYRTA", "1593075707", "B00DSQTMRA", "B00H9KKGTO", "B008220DGE", "B001FOPOD8", "B00J11U54K", "B00GPPXNIK", "B00I45844W", "B00DCRE9LY"], "bought_together": ["B000BGH2A4", "B000GBEWNY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00GMV8IVE", "B004P2VQZ2", "B00J5LXST0", "B002P7UCJK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 17532}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 16.99, "brand": "", "asin": "B0009S2T0M", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5177K3F5Y0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Oldboy"}

Cahit (Birol &#xDC;nel) is a middle-aged drunk whose apartment looks like the toilet inTrainspotting. Sibel (Sibel Kekilli) is a suicidal woman half his age, stuck at home with repressive relatives. They're two troubled Turks, adrift in Germany. A chance encounter at a psychiatric hospital represents a way out. If Cahit will marry her, Sibel can flee her family. They'll accept him, because he's Turkish. As for Cahit, he won't be alone anymore, left to mourn his dead wife and drink his life away. At first, things go as planned. Sibel moves into Cahit's dump and spiffs it up. The two live, eat, and party together, while continuing to see other people. Gradually, their marriage of convenience starts to resemble the real thing--until Cahit's violent tendencies get the best of him.--Kathleen C.

{"description": "Movie studios, by and large, avoid controversial subjects like race the way you might avoid a hive of angry bees. So it's remarkable thatCrasheven got made; that it's a rich, intelligent, and moving exploration of the interlocking lives of a dozen Los Angeles residents--black, white, latino, Asian, and Persian--is downright amazing. A politically nervous district attorney (Brendan Fraser) and his high-strung wife (Sandra Bullock, biting into a welcome change of pace fromMiss Congeniality) get car-jacked by an oddly sociological pair of young black men (Larenz Tate and Chris \"Ludacris\" Bridges); a rich black T.V. director (Terrence Howard) and his wife (Thandie Newton) get pulled over by a white racist cop (Matt Dillon) and his reluctant partner (Ryan Phillipe); a detective (Don Cheadle) and his Latina partner and lover (Jennifer Esposito) investigate a white cop who shot a black cop--these are only three of the interlocking stories that reach up and down class lines. Writer/director Paul Haggis (who wrote the screenplay forMillion Dollar Baby) spins every character in unpredictable directions, refusing to let anyone sink into a stereotype. The cast--ranging from the famous names above to lesser-known but just as capable actors like Michael Pena (Buffalo Soldiers) and Loretta Devine (Woman Thou Art Loosed)--meets the strong script head-on, delivering galvanizing performances in short vignettes, brief glimpses that build with gut-wrenching force.

{"description": "Diouana (Mbissine Th&#xE9;r&#xE8;se Diop) is a stranger in a strange land. In Dakar, she was a nanny--a job she found fulfilling--but is forced to leave when her employers, Madame (Anne-Marie Jelinek) and Monsieur (Robert Fontaine), relocate to Antibes. The Riviera is lovely, but she is demoted to maid and regularly reminded of her exotic origins--treated as an object and exploited for her \"Africanness.\" Proud and impassive, Diouana rarely speaks, but a running monologue reveals her growing disillusionment. \"The kitchen, the bathroom, the bedroom, the living room. That's all I do. That's not what I came to France for!\" So Diouana revolts the only way she knows how and stops doing everything for which she was taken from Senegal--cooking, cleaning, etc. Based on his short story, in turn inspired by actual events,Black Girlwas the first feature from Ousmane Semb&#xE8;ne (Faat Kin&#xE9;), the premier filmmaker of Sub-Saharan Africa. Though shot in a crude new wave style, the 60-minute film (also released in a 70-minute edition), effectively delineates the life of an unseen individual with no means of solace or escape. Interestingly, all parts were dubbed by other actors, contributing to the sense of alienation--even between Madame and Monsieur, who were also happier in Dakar.Black Girl(La Noire de...) is accompanied by Semb&#xE8;ne's 1963 debut,Borom Sarret. The 20-minute short offers an insightful look at a day in the life of a Dakar-based horse-cart driver (Ly Abdoulaye) orborom sarrett(from the Frenchbonhomme charret).--Kathleen C.

Tom Welling (TV's \"Smallville\"), Maggie Grace (TV's \"Lost\") and Selma Blair (Hellboy) star in this senses-shattering tale of demonic retribution, directed by Rupert Wainwright (Stigmata) and written by Cooper Layne.  Trapped within an eerie mist, the residents of Antonio Bay have become the unwitting victims of a horrifying vengeance.  One hundred years ago, a ship carrying lepers was purposely lured onto the rocky coastline and sunk, drowning all aboard.

{"description": "Veteran TV writer/director Tom Gries (East Side/West Side,Helter Skelter) created this action-packed drama about a four-man commando team (three Americans and one British) battling the German Army's Afrika Korps in World War II. Though primarily a vehicle for adventure fans,The Rat Patrolbenefited from smart scripting (Larry Cohen and Richard Landau both penned stories for the series) that refused to paint the German antagonist, Capt. Dietrich (well played by Hans Gudegast, who's better known today as Eric Braeden), as a stock Nazi heel; in fact, Christopher George's Sgt. Sam Troy and Dietrich occasionally partnered up to combat a common foe, as in the series' fifth and tenth episodes (\"The Chain of Death Raid\" and \"The Moment of Truce Raid,\" both of which are included in this four-disc set), which pit them against Arab fighters. Other highlights from the 1966-67 debut season include \"The Kill or Be Killed Raid\" (Gary Raymond's Moffitt must impersonate a German soldier to find a map to a hidden water source), \"The Wildest Raid of All\" (the Rat Patrol's plan to capture an important Nazi general goes awry), and \"The Blind Man's Bluff Raid\" (the Germans impersonate an American unit to trick a sunblinded Troy into revealing the Rat Patrol's location), but all 32 episodes deliver plenty of action and excitement.

{"description": "On the surface, David Cronenberg may seem an unlikely candidate to directA History of Violence, but dig deeper and you'll see that he's the right man for the job. As an intellectual seeker of meaning and an avowed believer in Darwinian survival of the fittest, Cronenberg knows that the story of mild-mannered small-town diner proprietor Tom Stall (Viggo Mortensen) is in fact a multilayered examination of inbred human behavior, beginning when Tom's skillful killing of two would-be robbers draws unwanted attention to his idyllic family life in rural Indiana. He's got a loving wife (Maria Bello) and young daughter (Heidi Hayes) who are about to learn things about Tom they hadn't suspected, and a teenage son (Ashton Holmes) who has inherited his father's most prominent survival trait, manifesting itself in ways he never expected. By the time Tom has come into contact with a scarred villain (Ed Harris) and connections that lead him to a half-crazy kingpin (William Hurt, in a spectacular cameo), Cronenberg has plumbed the dark depths of human nature so skillfully thatA History of Violencestands well above the graphic novel that inspired it (indeed, Cronenberg was unaware of the source material behind Josh Olson's chilling adaptation). With hard-hitting violence that's as sudden as it is graphically authentic, this isA History of Violencethat's worthy of serious study and widespread acclaim.--Jeff ShannonOn the DVDOn a single disc and with little fanfare, this DVD makes an excellent case for the best extras of the year. Dive into the one-hour-long documentary and learn more about moviemaking than on many a double-disc. The secret lies in director David Cronenberg's (and his usual crew) folksy casualness in showing off the craft, be it makeup (green screens were used), directing (Cronenberg doesn't storyboard), or art direction (the diner set). It also is very funny to hear about \"fish Fridays\" and how Maria Bello's Uncle Pete became an influence. Even the infamous sex-on-the-staircase scene is diagnosed with candor as stars Viggo Mortensen and Bello act as if there is no backstage camera. There's only one deleted scene, but it's uncommonly deconstructed on why it was filmed and why it was cut (it's a very Cronenbergian dream sequence). A short bit on Cannes is also a delight. So much is here that Cronenberg's smart commentary track is nearly superfluous. Isn't that a nice surprise?--Doug ThomasMore to ExploreThe Graphic NovelOther Graphic Novels that Inspired MoviesDavid Cronenberg EssentialsWhy We Love Maria BelloThe work of Viggo MortensenThe work of William HurtStills fromA History of ViolenceViggo Mortensoe as Tom StallAshton Holmes as Jack Stall and Kyle Schmid as Bobby JordanWilliam Hurt as Richie CusackEd Harris as Carl Fogarty and Viggo Mortensen as Tom StallMaria Bello as Edie StallDirector David Cronenberg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000YENUI6", "B001LRJH0U", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B008R65XP6", "B004SIP8ZM", "B001FB5634", "B0001EFV7C", "B00004W18Z", "B001EIOOWC", "6301971345", "B000M341QE", "B00000K31T", "B000GFLKF8", "B000P0J0D8", "0767802519", "B004SUDQ72", "B003ASLJQS", "B002PJYPYG", "6304698747", "B000F5WR4W", "B003Y5H4R0", "B0018O4YT0", "B00AEBB9CS", "B0028OH568", "B00HOGBXS6", "B00000JDIQ", "B000FUTVLY", "B002AT8KAG", "B000XR9L50", "6305313687", "0783228457", "B002QEHPQU", "B001FB55L2", "B000Y7WGOW", "B002VWNIEA", "B00022XE6S", "B006PTL1QM", "B000P0J0AG", "B004499LX0", "B00005JMOW", "B002T9H2LA", "B001TOD92C", "B005OK721G", "B000FKO5QK", "B0019EXZY4", "B002ZG99N6", "B0007DFJ0G", "B003LR5BD0", "B003RHZ6F2", "B00AEFY5B6", "B000N6TX1I", "0792833279", "B005LAIIJY", "B000FVQM2Y", "B000FC2FX8", "B001BNFRB2", "B00005JN0W", "B002XMGGK6", "B00007E8UI", "B0064NTZQ2", "B00D3DJIG8", "B0010DR4BO", "B0013XZ6X4", "B00AEFXE9U", "B007D5E7C2", "B000ALM40I", "B00001ZWUS", "B00005V9HH", "B00008RH3L", "0783229402", "B000QXDCLK", "B000P0J0EW", "B000BBOUUE", "B000A7DVR2", "B000K7VHQ4", "B00000F4MA", "B000XA5K48", "B00004XPPB", "B0002IQMAM", "B00029LNYQ", "B00003CXWV", "B004XQO90O", "B000GIW9I2", "B004U7MR14", "B002DKGWSE", "B0064MT1FI", "B0000TANUI", "B009T3AE1Y", "B0000VLKVM", "B00006LPGP", "B00005JLRE", "B000F7CMRM", "B00AEFXESQ", "B001DZOC64", "1558908315", "B0036TGTDE", "B000NOKFHQ", "B008220DGE", "B00007AJE1", "B000BVM1S2"], "bought_together": ["B000YENUI6", "B001LRJH0U"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000YENUI6", "B008MILL78", "B009T3AE1Y", "B000M341QE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 45602}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.36, "brand": "Warner Brothers", "asin": "B000CQLZ0Q", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51g0dghsrYL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "A History of Violence (New Line Platinum Series) [DVD]"}
{"description": "Based on Anthony Swofford&#x92;s excellentmemoirabout his experiences as a Marine Sniper in Gulf War I,Jarheadis a war movie in which the waiting is a far greater factor upon the characters than the war itself, and the build up to combat is more drama than what combat is depicted. To some viewers hoping for typical movie action, this will seem like a cruel joke. But it&#x92;s not. It&#x92;s just the story as it was written, and if you liked the book, you will probably like the movie. If you didn&#x92;t, then the movie won&#x92;t change your mind.The movie follows the trajectory of Swofford (played with thoughtful intensity by Jake Gyllenhaal) from wayward Marine recruit (he joined because he \"got lost on the way to college\") to skilled Marine sniper, and on into the desert in preparation for the attack on Iraq. No-nonsense, Marine-for-life Staff Sgt. Sykes (Jamie Foxx), the man who recruited Swofford and his spotter Troy (Peter Sarsgaard) into the sniper team, leads them in training, and in waiting where their lives are dominated by endless tension, pointless exercises in absurdity (like playing football in the scorching heat of the desert in their gas masks so it will look better for the media&#x92;s TV cameras), more training, and constant anticipation of the moment to come when they&#x92;ll finally get to kill. When the war does come, it moves too fast for Swofford&#x92;s sniper team, and the one chance they get at a kill--to do the one thing they&#x92;ve trained so hard and waited so long for--eludes them, leaving them to wonder what was the point of all they had endured.As directed by Sam Mendes (American Beauty), the movie remains very loyal to the language and vision of the book, but it doesn&#x92;t entirely work as the film needs something more than a literal translation to bring out its full potential. Mendes&#x92;s stark and, at times, apocalyptic visuals add a lot and strike the right tone: wide shots of inky-black oil raining down on the vast, empty desert from flaming oil wells contrasted with close-ups of crude-soaked faces struggling through the mire vividly bring to life the meaning of the tagline \"welcome to the suck.\" But much of the second half of the movie will probably leave some viewers feeling disappointed in the cinematic experience, while others might appreciate its microcosmic depiction of modern chaos and aimlessness.Jarheadis one of those examples where the book is better than the movie, but not for lack of trying.--Dan Vancini", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00JRB01RK", "B00275EGWY", "B001FB55L2", "B000065U1N", "B00JRB00RG", "B000P0J09C", "B00JU949TK", "079284646X", "B002ZG97RE", "B0015D20FE", "B00HLTD3ZW", "B00001ZWUS", "B005LAIGYQ", "B00AEBBA36", "B00JA3RVG4", "B002O3Z4Z2", "B008220CQU", "B00HEPE6MM", "B00102F5WK", "B003ASLJOU", "B000095WW8", "B00AZNEW5G", "B00HOGBXS6", "B00005YUPD", "B004XQO90O", "B000Y7WGOW", "B00AIBZMD6", "B00IKM5OCO", "B00JBGSHSQ", "B00005JOFQ", "B0036RPM8Y", "B00AEBB89W", "0743244915", "B003ELKNH2", "B00JL6L4UY", "B004L3AR0K", "B00A34LX2M", "B00005PJ8T", "B004SUDQ22", "B00I4X8KXY", "B00J11U54K", "B00005JK8K", "B00J0IN6Z4", "B0034G4P30", "B00IARA8KM", "B0000AC8LR", "B000M4RG42", "B00HW3LAF2", "B00DL48BM6", "B004LGGXG4", "B0000ACOXL", "B00AEFXVCU", "B0000542CK", "B00005JLOB", "B00006JU8B", "B0000797IO", "B00JPFTS2M", "B00005U8QN", "B005LAIGRS", "B00AEBB86U", "B00HEPC0TS", "B00KDK64DY", "B00JH4SZWK", "B00IO03I6Q", "B00HWWUR02", "B001MZ5W3M", "B000KGGIZK", "B000DZ7YN8", "B00005JMXX", "B00AEBB86A", "B0007KIFGE", "B00IKM5MIA", "1558908315", "B005LAIGLE", "B001N44BVQ", "B00IJS2OHM", "B00005R87B", "B00J5JSV3A", "B00HX0KIAM", "B00ICWO144", "B00GV8B17Q", "B00JQF7ZR6", "B003UESJHO", "B00005JL5F", "B00GMV8JVI", "B00IKM5NJS", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00KNALRZ4", "B00JU94ZPS", "B00E8AVNAE", "B00HVXK15S", "B00004XPPG", "B0034G4P94", "B009POCG0Y", "B008MIL46Q", "B009AMAJPA", "B001AQO3WY", "B00HGJAPYO", "B00ALCBTWU", "B008JFUNKU"], "bought_together": ["B00275EGWY", "B000065U1N"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00275EGWY", "B00JU949TK", "B000065U1N", "B000P0J09C"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 15490}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.75, "brand": "VISIT MORE @ HIBISCUS EXPRESS, http://www.amazon.com/shops/AXD9LOVGJXES3", "asin": "B000DZIGDU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51P2RVVCH9L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Jarhead (Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "The latest entry in theHarry Pottersaga could be retitledFast Times at Hogwarts, where finding a date to the winter ball is nearly as terrifying as worrying about Lord Voldemort's return. Thus, the young wizards' entry into puberty (and discovery of the opposite sex) opens up a rich mining field to balance out the dark content in the fourth movie (and the stories are only going to get darker). Mike Newell (Four Weddings and a Funeral) handily takes the directing reins and eases his young cast through awkward growth spurts into true young actors. Harry (Daniel Radcliffe, more sure of himself) has his first girl crush on fellow student Cho Chang (Katie Leung), and has his first big fight with best bud Ron (Rupert Grint). Meanwhile, Ron's underlying romantic tension with Hermione (Emma Watson) comes to a head over the winter ball, and when she makes one of those girl-into-woman Cinderella entrances, the boys' reactions indicate they've all crossed a threshold.But don't worry, there's plenty of wizardry and action inGoblet of Fire. When the deadly Triwizard Tournament is hosted by Hogwarts, Harry finds his name mysteriously submitted (and chosen) to compete against wizards from two neighboring academies, as well as another Hogwarts student. The competition scenes are magnificently shot, with much-improved CGI effects (particularly the underwater challenge). And the climactic confrontation with Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes, in a brilliant bit of casting) is the most thrilling yet.Goblet, the first installment to get a PG-13 rating, contains some violence as well as disturbing images for kids and some barely shrouded references at sexual awakening (Harry's bath scene in particular). The 2 1/2-hour film, lean considering it came from a 734-page book, trims out subplots about house-elves (they're not missed) and gives little screen time to the standard crew of the otherPotterfilms, but adds in more of Britain's finest actors to the cast, such as Brendan Gleeson as Mad-Eye Moody and Miranda Richardson as Rita Skeeter. Michael Gambon, in his second round as Professor Dumbledore, still hasn't brought audiences around to his interpretation of the role he took over after Richard Harris died, but it's a small smudge in an otherwise spotless adaptation.--Ellen A.

Helen, also a widow with ten kids of her own that include the six she and her husband adopted, feels the attraction as well. It&#x92;s no wonder they rush into marriage without telling their kids. True love can conquer all&#x97;right? Unfortunately for Frank and Helen, the families don&#x92;t mesh quite as easily as the newlyweds had hoped. They probably should have seen the culture clash coming: the disciplined Beardsleys run things by the book; for the energetic and vivacious Norths, there is no book. Helen&#x92;s kids aren&#x92;t pleased about moving and sharing rooms with a bunch of uptight strangers. Frank&#x92;s children have nothing in common with the Norths. Since both sets of kids aren&#x92;t happy, they devise a plan to undermine the marriage and team up to plot the breakup. East meets west as the two families finds a way to work together&#x97;in order to separate.

The premise: put \"normal\" middle-class Americans (in this case, all of them white) into situations where they are way out of their comfort zones, archetypal fish out of water who must spend 30 days experiencing how the other half lives. Thus we have tales involving a Christian from West Virginia who lives with a Muslim American couple in Dearborn, Michigan; a straight dude from rural Michigan who moves in with a homosexual roommate in San Francisco's Castro District, \"the gayest place on Earth;\" and a mother in Phoenix who, concerned about her daughter's excessive drinking at college, goes on her own heavy alcohol binge. Spurlock himself is the subject of an episode in which he and his fianc&#xE9; try to subsist on the minimum wage, while the only one that doesn't fit the mold concerns an out-of-shape 34-year-old man trying to find the fountain of youth by embarking on a strict regimen of exercise, diet, and major doses of steroids and Human Growth Hormone pills.The stories don't all have happy endings: the Phoenix woman's drinking has no affect whatsoever on her daughter, and the steroid guy drops out when his sperm count almost immediately drops to zero. But the discomfort felt by the others seems genuine, as do the lessons in tolerance and cultural understanding they eventually learn, even given the artificial confines of reality TV. What's more, Spurlock provides some real information along the way, telling us how many drinks it takes to be over the legal limit in Arizona (five shots ought to do it) or how many passages in the Bible are interpreted as proscribing homosexuality (six), detailing the negative side effects of \"anti-aging\" medicines (too many to list here), and offering insight into such Muslim customs as prayer and fasting (the Christian dresses in Muslim garb and even learns a little Arabic). Extra features include commentary (by Spurlock and others) on four of the episodes, as well as \"Diary Cams\" (outtakes, basically) for all six.--Sam Graham", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000WGYMII", "B003H05ZSW", "B000OU081M", "B0047UJBP4", "B0002OXVBO", "B000UNYJXQ", "B0038P1CXI", "B000N6U0E2", "B00G0PXU2Y", "B000GG4Y0K", "B0027BOL4G", "B0030Y11XS", "B0019Z3P5W", "B00595W3MO", "B00B119H1A", "B0007GP836", "B004UXUV98", "B00031TXGI", "B000ICL3KG", "B002DKGWXO", "0800177967", "B0002MPPVU", "B000QXCOV4", "B000BTH4K4", "B002SF9YMA", "B003Q6D28C", "B00996RSYM", "B00652U72S", "B00004Y62V"], "bought_together": ["B000WGYMII", "B003H05ZSW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0038P1CXI", "B003H05ZSW", "B000WGYMII", "B000GG4Y0K"]}, "price": 10.0, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 80911}, "asin": "B000EXDRZ8", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5116KXD414L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "30 Days - Season 1"}

Lincoln's brother Michael Scofield (Wentworth Miller), who just happens to have designed Illinois' Fox River Penitentiary where Lincoln is on death row, hatches an elaborate escape plan. Michael's plan involves getting himself incarcerated in Fox River and smuggling the prison's blueprints by having them hidden in tattoos that cover his entire torso. Once inside, Michael must form alliances with a rogue's gallery of felons with their own sometimes unsavory motives. Meanwhile, on the outside, Lincoln's lawyer and one-time girlfriend Veronica Donovan (Robin Tunney), pursued by Secret Service agents, attempts to unravel the conspiracy that sent her man to the slammer.Prison Break is anchored by tight, suspenseful writing clearly relished by the largely little-known cast. Standouts include Robert Knepper as the murderer/pedophile T-Bag, who somehow makes such a despicable character likeable. Stacey Keach ofMike Hammerfame plays the warden-with-a-heart-of-gold, who clashes with Captain Brad Bellick (Wade Williams) over whether to rehabilitate the inmates or makes their lives more miserable. Peter Stormare, famous for his skills with a wood chipper in Fargo, turns in a deliciously menacing performance as mob boss John Abruzzi, while Amaury Nolasco's winsome Fernando Sucre shares a cell and secrets with Miller's Scofield. Watching the show one gets a sense that this is the opening salvo of Wentworth Miller's career, which will doubtless include roles as assassins, detectives, super heroes, and perhaps the champion of staring contests. Midway through the season it's explained that Scofield is a genius with an heightened sensitivity to other peoples' suffering, which sums up what makes the show so great--the mind-bendingly intricate plot is a framework for moments when people make others suffer and cope with the burden of their own suffering.The six-disc set includes 22 addictive episodes, audio commentary on selected episodes, three featurettes, and alternate and deleted scenes. As with most TV shows on DVD, the \"previously onPrison Break\" intros can get tiresome, but that's what the fast forward button is for. --Ryan BoudinotBeyondPrison Breakon DVDWatchBoneson DVDCatch up on24on DVDCheck outSaving Graceon DVDStills fromPrison Break- Season One (Click for larger image)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000RO6JY0", "B001934SNM", "B0024F08RO", "B0024FAR4I", "B00005JNOG", "B000FIMG68", "B0012CJQYG", "B000QDLSR0", "B000NDEXK2", "B0024FAR4S", "B00194D7ZQ", "B0012CJQY6", "B000P6YNSE", "B0002XVQSU", "B00008YGRU", "B000ICLRKC", "B000B837XI", "B0018CWEYY", "B001DJLCRC", "B000NOKFGW", "B000RF1QE2", "B0024FAR5M", "B001L5SRJE", "B0012CJQZ0", "B006WNMHYG", "B000FFJYE8", "B000FVQLIO", "B0001O3YLM", "B0012CJQZA", "B0015TX2LO", "B0015ABRE2", "B002N5N5QQ", "B00274SI4C", "B000N3T0EG", "B000SQFC2C", "B0019LY5IM", "B000OIOOVE", "B001RTSPVY", "B0008JIJ1A", "B0049P1VHS", "B000Q6GUW0", "B0012CJQYQ", "B001RXDM2C", "B0079IEPHA", "B000GB75CO", "B000MR8W92", "B005GT3XD6", "B002N5N5M0", "B00EEDNR9A", "B0024FAD9C", "B003L77GH4", "B00005Y6YJ", "B00CYQXH4O", "B000V86OKG", "B000CR7RCK", "B002N5N5MK", "B000HT3P60", "B001VPJZ0E", "B001UREJXQ", "B0038M2APA", "B0036EH3XE", "B0014DO5XU", "B0081QF6Q8", "B000G6BL88", "B001QOGY54", "B003VTKZA2", "B000QUTTPG", "B009RX8MQ0", "B0060MYKYY", "B001ILFUAA", "B0015A5JVY", "B000HT3P7E", "B004YM6JLO", "B001VPJYZK", "B0032UYFAQ", "B0009IW88K", "B005LAJ22Q", "B0020TS5EM", "B000Q6GUKW", "B000YABIQ6", "B000R7GKQE", "B009NH6AOQ", "B0032UYFA6", "B003L77GRO", "B003L77GTC", "B003R0MEXQ", "B0015RRNMA", "B00J5LXT44", "B000S8CLR4", "B000FZETIE", "B000FUTVLO", "B00166UFSY", "B002ZCY7SW", "B001OQCVCE", "B002JVWRAO", "B00000FBH2", "B00IWTVDUW", "B000CNE0RO", "B0002DRE72"], "bought_together": ["B000RO6JY0", "B001934SNM"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001934SNM", "B0024FAR4I", "B008P0PNOU", "B000RO6JY0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 10962}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 14.69, "brand": "TCFHE", "asin": "B000FKO3GW", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/519F139WE8L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Prison Break - Season One"}

{"description": "The staggering breadth of roles inLaurence Olivier Presentswill reaffirm why so many consider Olivier the greatest actor of the modern era. With every part, from a fussy, controlling lover in Harold Pinter'sThe Collectionto Tennessee William's swaggering Big Daddy inCat on a Hot Tin Roofto a daffy Italian patriarch inSaturday, Sunday, Monday, the British thespian tackles every role with zest and skill, never letting the seemingly effortless accents overshadow the emotions. Ironically, the show that really emphasizes Olivier's talent is the one he isn't in:Hindle Wakes, a strikingly progressive and sardonically funny play from 1912, is co-directed by Olivier and stars Donald Pleasance. Pleasance is a topnotch actor, solid and subtle, but he just doesn't have the cunning intelligence and perpetual fire that burns in Olivier's eyes. These plays feature a fantastic array of actors (including Malcolm McDowell, Helen Mirren, Natalie Wood, Joan Plowright, and Alan Bates), but the one who really gives Olivier a run for his money is Joanne Woodward. Her performance as the lonely wife of a struggling Midwestern alcoholic (Olivier) inCome Back, Little Shebais wrenchingly sad without once asking for pity. Their combined firepower, supported by a simple but assured performance by Carrie Fisher, makes this William Inge play the strongest of a substantial selection. (The one weak spot is the \"bonus\" filmThe Ebony Tower; though less stage-bound--it was adapted from a novel by John Fowles, not from a play like the others--the story is lightweight and tries to make up for it with copious nudity.) Towards the end of his career, Olivier took on a lot of mediocre movies for the money; these straightforward but effective television productions will erase all memory of the mercenary hackwork and leave Olivier's fierce, phenomenal talent glowing in your mind.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0074JODYY", "B000QGE8IS", "B00CU55HMY", "B000FILVO6", "0769712231", "B00007L4MV", "B002E01M8S", "0684831686", "B00GHP8SH4", "B003O2H7MA", "B000GRUQKQ", "B001IHJ97O", "B00G7QPYX4", "B000EBD9T4", "B00331RHC2", "B00AATUZQA", "B009T6CXG0", "B00EDOS5X8", "B004FGA2MG", "B0072BNJZ8", "B0024FAG7Q", "B000A1GKPI", "0671417010", "B0019BI1FA", "B009ERK1ZO", "B008H6GHE2", "B000056HEA", "0671558692", "0747206112", "0385098499", "B00GCVWU4U", "0385477031", "B000BP86RI", "B00005TNF9"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0074JODYY", "B001KXZGO6", "0671558692", "B000QGE8IS"]}, "price": 10.0, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 181697}, "asin": "B000GI3KH6", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ZS1R8X4YL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Laurence Olivier Presents: Cat on a Hot Tin Roof / The Collection / Hindle Wakes / Come Back, Little Sheba / Saturday, Sunday, Monday / The Ebony Tower"}
{"description": "The love life of a woolly mammoth--handled with G-rated delicacy--drives this sequel to the first computer-animated romp in the age of prehistoric mammals. While the firstIce Agetook a delightful premise and suffocated it with a formulaic plot--in which a mammoth named Manfred (voiced by Ray Romano,Everyone Loves Raymond), a sloth named Sid (John Leguizamo,Moulin Rouge!), and a sabre-tooth tiger named Diego (Denis Leary,Rescue Me) helped an abandoned human infant return to its tribe (basically,Three Mammals and a Baby)--the sequel takes the now-familiar setting, gives it a shapeless, episodic storyline, and yet somehow becomes pretty darn entertaining. Faced with the threat of a flood from melting ice, our heroic trio are on the run to escape from their blossoming valley. On the way, they meet a female mammoth (Queen Latifah,Bringing Down the House) who thinks she's an opossum and get menaced by some freshly defrosted carnivo!  rous fish. Add into the mix a herd of lava-worshipping mini-sloths, some Busby Berkeley-style vultures, and more ingenious slapstick featuring the acorn-crazed Scrat, andIce Age: The Meltdownwill amuse even jaded adults. --Bret FetzerBeyondIce Age: The MeltdownIce Age - Super Cool EditionIce Age & Ice Age 2: The Meltdown - (DVD 2-Pack)Funtastic Adventures Collection Box Set (Ice Age / Robots / Fern Gully / Once Upon a Rainforest)Stills fromIce Age: The Meltdown(click for larger image)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001GCUNWQ", "B005LAIISA", "B0006UEVT0", "B005QODEEE", "B000AY74OG", "B001NCDFTW", "B004HO6I4M", "B000UVKGPI", "B000MV9026", "B00005JMQZ", "B005LAIHW2", "B00CWM58WY", "B0039N74CW", "B0006JMLRK", "B00005JNQS", "B00CHVJODE", "B002WJI2QQ", "B002ZG9904", "B000L22SG6", "B00365F6I2", "B00BG0RSJ4", "B0042U94UQ", "B008JFUQ16", "B000M343BC", "B001ECQ75A", "B001DPHDCY", "B00JK531ES", "B0013FSWT2", "B001GCUO7A", "B001FTIJS0", "B001GCUNW6", "B0012EM5D8", "B00G5G7EXY", "B009PPO78W", "B00005JNS0", "B00E00OGE2", "B00E9ZATJO", "B0030IIZ4M", "B00007LVCM", "B0030IIYYS", "B000VBJEEG", "B000FQISFS", "B00ALMNCLQ", "B004EPZ034", "0783231474", "B00003CXJ4", "B002ZG97YM", "B00AFEX83C", "B00F522C7C", "B000H7JCK0", "B0046A9RMM", "B00HLTD2OE", "B0013FSL3E", "B00947N6D8", "B001U3D88M", "B001PR0YEE", "B00275EHJG", "B001HN6918", "B00GRZPQCO", "B004EPZ0AC", "B008YWY0HK", "B0090SI1RM", "B004G600A4", "B001HN6922", "B0000AOX0O", "B00LG6YEKE", "B003TJM6I8", "B0000VV4W2", "B001KVZ6FW", "B00GDT5T9Y", "B00005JN4W", "B00EV1YZ96", "B004LWZW7Y", "B00029LO0Y", "B004HO6HXY", "B001OMU6UM", "B002XODB66", "B000SJQQPQ", "B005LAIH4A", "B00AEFXMSS", "B000BITUVG", "B000RMJ4F8", "B005F96UJ6", "B005SDUV4E", "B003Y5H5AG", "B004EPZ048", "B001APZMJS", "B009PQCR74", "B003H9M1Q2", "B0000CABKY", "B000AAF1TU", "B00004R99F", "B00CTQWJEI", "B00EPH8SFI", "B0000AK7AA", "B003UESJF6", "B00EBBGLFC", "B0034G4OYA", "B005KG4EFG", "B00H7KJTMG"], "bought_together": ["B001GCUNWQ", "B005LAIISA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005LAIISA", "B001GCUNWQ", "B0006UEVT0", "B00CWM58WY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 30729}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.4, "brand": "Fox Home Entertainment", "asin": "B000GUJYZQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518KJJQ5ZNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Ice Age - The Meltdown (Full Screen Edition)"}

{"description": "British comedy is often known for its menagerie of absurdities. Little Britain - The Complete Third Series upholds this tradition with the comedy genius of Matt Lucas and David Walliams, as they take it to up another notch in the third seasom. Little Britain has cultivated a devotion to the characters, listen carefully and you may hear the person next to you quoting \"Yeah, but no, but yeah but&#x85;\". Lucas and Walliams reveal them to us bit by bit, so we remain perplexed enough to imagine where they came from and what will eventually happen to them. We are dropped into the middle of their lives, and are lucky enough to observe them sorting things out. The episodes on this two-disc set are filled with returning favorites we get to know even better (whether we want to or not), as well as introducing new \"Britons\". We witness the insensitive and abusive Marjorie Daws, leader of Fatfighters weight loss support group, encouraging the group members to snack on \"dust\" because it has no calories. A returning favorite is Daffyd, the rotund, spandex-wearing, self proclaimed \"only gay in the village\", though life, his family, and the \"homophobic\" village repeatedly show him otherwise. New characters not to be missed include a lovely woman unable to control her bodily functions, a questionable mail order bride, and a rival for the spa resident Bubbles. Of course the sassiest narrator on television returns, spouting articulately, \"Who They? What do? And why?\" His banter is just another reason why visiting with the people of Little Britain is hilariously unforgettable.--Rachel Moss", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000F7CMSG", "B0009FVS8Y", "B000UPMZ4E", "B000N8UY1E", "B001G0NK28", "B006K10WII", "B00JJRLG7G", "B0012EM5BK", "B001PMRBMC", "B002945DX4", "B00004Z4V5", "B0009WFFBS", "B0083V2VYG", "B001NOMOS8", "B0009WFFD6", "B002EOVX9W", "B0000797E5", "B0000AQS8B", "B00065GX8C", "B0074JOD8U", "B0000A02TY", "B000U1ZV9E", "B000RXZILG", "B000BVM1SM", "B001E181XC", "B000VA3JDO", "B008B4LRMC", "0091914426"], "bought_together": ["B000F7CMSG", "B000UPMZ4E"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000F7CMSG", "B0009FVS8Y", "B000UPMZ4E", "B000N8UY1E"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 58776}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 13.99, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B000HLDFAE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51VE6FY2NEL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Little Britain - The Complete Third Series"}
{"description": "The sci-fi adventurePlanetes(2004) opens in 2075, as eager but maladroit Ai Tanabe arrives at Space Station ISPV-7--and discovers she's been assigned to the Debris Section, the department charged with cleaning up the orbiting junk that threatens interplanetary navigation.  Ai immediately begins squabbling with her instructor, veteran astronaut Hachirota \"Hachimaki\" Hoshino. The set-up of a feisty newcomer joining a team of eccentric grunts recallsPatlabor: the oddballs in the Debris Section are also under-appreciated and underpaid, but hardworking and dedicated. In the first few episodes, the relationship between Tanabe and Hachimaki feels like anime boilerplate, but the filmmakers deftly unfold their back stories, transforming standard characters into intriguing individuals. Hachimaki has to wrestle with his fears and dreams as well as his relationship with Tanabe. WheneverPlanetesrisks falling into formula, the filmmakers veer off in a new direction. In a less imaginative series, when Hachimaki quits the Debris Section to try out for the experimental ship making the first voyage to Jupiter, he'd realize he'd made a mistake and go back to working and squabbling in the Debris Section. Instead, director Goro Taniguchi and his artists involve the characters in a deadly plot launched by the terrorist Space Defense Front. The extras include photographs of real space debris that's fallen to Earth and a discussion with NASA officials, who warn there may be 15,000 objects 10cm or larger orbiting the planet at speeds approaching 8 km./sec.

{"description": "Okay, let&#x92;s get one thing straight right off the bat:Family Guyis not, never has been, and never will be,The Simpsons. Nor is itSouth Park,King of the Hill, or any one of a number of other shows on Adult Swim.  But yes, it is in many ways a rip-off of those other shows (especiallyThe Simpsons; let&#x92;s not even pretend otherwise). But so what? By now, you either think the show&#x92;s funny, or you don&#x92;t, and the derivativeness either bothers you, or it doesn&#x92;t. Volume 4 is likely to just cement your feelings one way or the other, because this collection features some of the funniest, and the most offensive material yet. It&#x92;s also  the most cohesive. The show has always been incredibly erratic, turning on a dime to fit in all those jokes from out of the blue that start with Peter saying \"Boy, this is worse than that time when...\"  But by now, the writers and series creator/executive producer Seth MacFarlane have figured out how to more seamlessly integrate them into the show, and that&#x92;s just what it needed to really come together. In fact, the extra attention being paid to the show recently in the form of swipes fromThe Simpsonsand especiallySouth Park(which dedicated an entire episode to trying to kill offFamily Guy) is evidence that this is probably the peak for the series. This volume is 14 episodes, and stand-outs include \"The Courtship of Stewie&#x92;s Father,\" which gives more face time to creepy old man Herbert (brilliantly voiced by Mike Henry), and \"The Father, the Son, and the Holy Fonz,\" in which Peter starts his own church dedicated to Fonzie fromHappy Days. Of course, there is still the lingering question of who the real star ofFamily Guyis: Peter or Stewie? The little football-head gets his moments to shine in \"Sibling Rivalry,\" in which he battles with half-brother Bertram, and... well, pretty much every other episode, as he continues to get many of the memorable lines. Along with the extra features, over 40 deleted scenes, extensive commentaries, and featurettes, you true fans will get more than your share of laughs from this collection, which is what you watch the show for in the first place.--Daniel Vancini", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000AQ68Z0", "B000RO6JZO", "B0012018OE", "B00008YGRV", "B000083C6V", "B001VFM0ZG", "B003DZX46G", "B003L77G9W", "B0058YPMHO", "B00E0FW054", "B000A3DFV8", "B003V3FVQ6", "B00FR81Z40", "B000E6ES9O", "B002HQK5O6", "B0006B41GM", "B000NNK4DM", "B0012KSUTA", "B001RIZ7OI", "B0040JHX0W", "B001N9VW5Y", "B003L77G7Y", "B003CN5B7E", "B0053O8A32", "B002LARYTW", "B003X4KHRG", "B000YOX3HE", "B00LFW6BA0", "B00BYNL8DU", "B00A2JFNSS", "B008412UKA", "B008412UQ4", "B0058RN7KA", "B000ADWCYY", "B007ZFR67I", "B0000CABL2", "B00023P49M", "B00023P49C", "B0001ZWLVU", "B00008YGRS", "B001O0TWXG", "B000FSME2Y", "B002JVWQYG", "B000CNESM6", "B000KLQUMQ", "B0044E9JTG", "B001L1S1PI", "B007KFZ85K", "B000R7I3XC", "B0018O5WUU", "B007KFZ7UQ", "B0024FAR52", "B004MLEYTG", "B000RPD0DC", "B004696M94", "B0006Z2L2Y", "B001RP976A", "B007KFZ7PG", "B000FEBWTE", "B000ERVJNG", "B00158K0V0", "B000067DNE", "B007KFZ7YM", "B0030Y11UG", "B00HDU9UOW", "B000E0OE3K", "B000RW3VDE", "B002LASCJ8", "B000B5XOWU", "B001GQ3GHG", "B009SQ9Q5M", "B007KFZ8B4", "B000KWZ1PC", "B00DTPRZ10", "B006W93ELK", "B008AITJ7O", "B000GETU2E", "B000UZDO62", "B000ZT0S9O", "B003KZ27N0", "B00BI5YEWG", "B007KFZ87S", "B007KFZ88M", "B002C11LCG", "B0024FAR6Q", "B000F48D14", "B007Z3UUF0", "B008OTH56Q", "B0060OKO2O", "B0064ESJ18", "B007KFZ7Q0", "B0072BNK02", "B0019D151K", "B004XVMCH6", "B00GJPUXKC", "B001DZOC78", "B0019CSXAM", "B002N5N4FS", "B005QIOJUI", "B003L77G6U"], "bought_together": ["B000AQ68Z0", "B000RO6JZO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00008YGRV", "B000083C6V", "B000AQ68Z0", "B003L77G9W"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 27839}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 13.7, "brand": "Twentieth Century Fox", "asin": "B000HT3P6U", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GYVSQ1NPL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Family Guy, Volume Four"}

{"description": "Robert Mitchum was already a dab hand at film noir when he stepped into the delicious trap ofAngel Face, Otto Preminger's 1952 addition to the genre. Here Mitchum plays an amazingly seducible guy who falls under the spell of spoiled rich girl Jean Simmons; a former race-car driver, he'd like to open his own sports-car garage, and her money would come in awfully handy. But she's got a few quirks to work out first, including her hostility for her stepmother, who doesn't stand a chance against this poker-faced vixen. True to its title, the film has an absolutely deadpan approach to this material, as Preminger's calm style recalls more the clinical courtroom proceedings ofAnatomy of a Murderthan the perverse lushness ofLaura. Mitchum's in absolutely top form, and Jean Simmons has just right amount of intensity behind her porcelain beauty. The supporting cast is led by Herbert Marshall, as Simmons' father, a writer who's been sponging off his wife for years, and Leon Ames does a skillful turn as a crafty lawyer. The ending is as pre-ordained as can be, and the film moves toward its sinister conclusion without turning its head to explore other options. But that's why we love film noir.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000B8384Q", "B000CNE088", "B004A30AW6", "B00023P4GA", "B004C2523M", "B009X919UE", "B0009X7682", "B001CC7PM6", "B00AQ6J5YA", "B00005RDRL", "B000244EYW", "B00023P4II", "B000087F79", "B000EXDSBQ", "B0006Z2NE0", "B003YY2886", "B0009X7678", "B00L1WJIOU", "B00004XPPK", "B0024FAG8A", "B000JLTREU", "B0007ZEO8C", "B0089LT800", "B00E18QKJ2", "B00CVB6XF2", "B000B83846", "B00007ELD1", "B00012L786", "B004VA0R7Q", "B0087ZG7OI", "B00005Y70U", "B000244F2S", "B000EXDSBG", "B006X0ZN3K", "B00005AUK9", "B00DBE97S8", "B00074DY0M", "B000LN6UHI", "B002YNQEF6", "B000B8380A", "B0010KHOSK", "B0089LT7ZG", "6305999872", "B00K6D1S7A", "B000JLTR9A", "B000PKG7DE", "B000CNE08I", "B00K6D1R0I", "B00004W19C", "B00097DXY4", "6305770328", "B000BGH2NG", "B0024FAG80", "B00097DY20", "B00ICWO1LC", "B00AEBBA7W", "B000244EWY", "B002YNQEFG", "B004H0M2UK", "B0007ZEO7S", "B00008LDNZ", "B001CC7PLW", "B00I9BU60Q", "B000FFJYA2", "B00023P4G0", "B0080JG2GE", "B00097DY0M", "B00004W229", "B003ZYU3U0", "B00KE3B9US", "B00005LC4D", "B000FI9OCW", "B00BGARG3C", "B000FTCLQW", "B00AB2NX4M", "B004LUOWZY", "B000FKO3VC", "B000KJTGFG", "B0010KHOSU", "B00FPUN21O", "B0000AZKO7", "B000FKO3VM", "B00AEFXRWO", "B0026YA0BM", "B000PKG7CU", "B0086IMMUO", "B006WQUGI2", "B00ITZXDDY", "B00457ZNS8", "B00004RER5", "B0047BXR1C", "B000FKO3VW", "B00DBE98OG", "B00007ELDG", "B00005AUKD", "B000244EWO", "B0008ENICA", "B00C3ALM02", "B000BGH2N6", "B003O2H7MA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000JLTRGI", "B009X919UE", "B0006Z2NE0", "B0009X7678"]}, "price": 39.96, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 51752}, "asin": "B000JLTREK", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51d6ps5N6gL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Angel Face"}
{"description": "Take the regular ingredients for a run-of-the-mill TV sitcom: an overweight and unattractive husband, a wife that seems way out of his league, their adorable but bratty child, and some whimsical neighbors. Add in the plethora of expletives folks have come to expect from HBO television, some occasional male nudity, and terribly raunchy one-liners. Mix those up with a live studio audience, cheap sets, and an overall low budget look, andLucky Louieis what comes out. That being said--the show is intelligent and hilarious.\"Lucky\" Louie (Louis C.K.) is a stay-at-home dad who works part-time at a muffler shop. His wife, Kim (Pamela Adlon), is the breadwinner of the household, but her meager wages can barely provide them with a run-down apartment in a bad neighborhood. Louie has the moral support of his friends Mike (Mike Hagerty,Friends) and Rich (Jim Norton), who provide some of the show's funniest and most disgusting moments. To only make things more inappropriate, Louie is constantly trying to cultivate a relationship with his African American neighbor Walter (Jerry Minor)--only because he is dying to have a black friend.  This very adult sitcom takes a refreshing step back from the regular \"one-hour conflict resolution\" depiction of family, and instead suggests that healthy relationships are full of constant discord. C.K. and Adlon, who build off each other superbly, give an honest love-hate portrayal of marriage and parenting. For those who enjoy listening to NPRandthe most vulgar of stand up comedy, this show is sure to please.--Jordan Thompson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B007QU37LG", "B003R4ZMOA", "B00K8HAIAW", "B000EULSSE", "B007QU37L6", "B004B93RC4", "B000P6R6Y2", "B001FRNB94", "B008NEMQ5W", "B00020HB3W", "B0010XB1WM", "B00KCTG4PO", "B000AYYV74", "B001BEK88I", "B008NERFVW", "B009LDD40U", "B003ES5JH4", "B008NEMQ16", "B004BTS8LE", "B000MEYKA0", "B004YM6J8W", "B00HUCF6KK", "B0053O8ACS", "B005MRMF2M", "B003L77GE2", "B000VTHYAE", "B00HUCF420", "B000SO7LQO", "B002N5N5PM", "B005S97V82", "B00E4V0E34", "B0033WH6MW", "B00K0MM4AM", "B000CQQID0", "B005NHZB54", "B00H9KKKAY", "B000QFAFMW", "B003X3BY8I", "B00BOTCHRU", "B009LDCW1M", "B00BQK4Y7S", "B00CZNZQGS", "B00C2U6I3Y", "B007WGDCPU", "B004V2S4QK", "B001IBIDLI", "B00H9HZGQ0", "B00008PHCU", "B00GMV8LIO", "B00HYRYMZQ", "B00GMV8KGW", "B0083XXWRE", "B0053O8A78", "0767908104", "B0011TGJXQ", "B004GIIHYI", "B000TGJ8EE", "1416950222", "B00HW3EXCE", "B009RJRHLA", "B000NVIGL6", "B007197I4Y", "B00HOGBXTU", "B000089CT7", "B00006RCNV", "B00BTRKMNI", "B000GH3CWK", "B007CO5MVE", "B00000IC7G", "B00AEBB8TM", "B008L0YMWS", "B004YM6JCS", "B008G33O0G", "B004EPYZCQ", "B00I4X8KU2", "B000AJJNI6", "B00EHJC9AE", "B003L77GJM", "B001LRL4XI", "B0089AJELY", "B00H9L28OO", "B00JAQJNN0", "B002DPPH6W", "B0024F146I", "B00IG2ZEQO", "B000U1ZV1W", "B008V90TZI", "147671441X", "B007UW9WKK", "B0053O8A8M", "B002TQKL0W", "B00IUKPIXG", "B00L9IJF8A", "B0060MYL3E", "B00HRJVHOU", "B00BEJL69U", "B00BGI07NK", "B000E3L7F0", "B00BI7ZAM2", "B002WC89WK"], "bought_together": ["B007QU37LG", "B003R4ZMOA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003R4ZMOA", "B007QU37LG", "B004B93RC4", "B001FRNB94"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 21465}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 14.84, "brand": "HBO Studios", "asin": "B000KF0DFM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516F686XWKL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Lucky Louie - The Complete First Season"}
{"description": "Martin Scorsese makes a welcome return to the mean streets (of Boston, in this case) withThe Departed, hailed by many as Scorsese's best film sinceCasino. Since this crackling crime thriller is essentially a Scorsese-stamped remake of the acclaimed 2002 Hong Kong thrillerInfernal Affairs, the film was intensely scrutinized by devoted critics and cinephiles, and while Scorsese's intense filmmaking and all-star cast deserve ample acclaim,The Departedis also worthy of serious re-assessment, especially with regard to what some attentive viewers described as sloppy craftsmanship (!), notably in terms of mismatched shots and jagged continuity. But no matter where you fall on the Scorsese appreciation scale, there's no denying thatThe Departedis a signature piece of work from one of America's finest directors, designed for maximum impact with a breathtaking series of twists, turns, and violent surprises. It's an intricate cat-and-mouse game, but this time the cat and mouse are both moles: Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) is an ambitious cop on the rise, planted in the Boston police force by criminal kingpin Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a hot-tempered police cadet who's been artificially disgraced and then planted into Costello's crime operation as a seemingly trustworthy soldier. As the multilayered plot unfolds (courtesy of a scorching adaptation byKingdom of Heavenscreenwriter William Monahan), Costigan and Sullivan conduct a volatile search for each other (they're essentially looking for \"themselves\") while simultaneously wooing the psychiatrist (Vera Farmiga) assigned to treat their crime-driven anxieties.Such convenient coincidences might sink a lesser film, butThe Departedis so electrifying that you barely notice the plot-holes. And while Nicholson's profane swagger is too much \"Jack\" and not enough \"Costello,\" he's still a joy to watch, especially in a film that's additionally energized by memorable (and frequently hilarious) supporting roles for Alec Baldwin, Mark Wahlberg, and a host of other big-name performers.The Departedalso makes clever and plot-dependent use of cell-phones, to the extent that it couldn't exist without them. Powered by Scorsese's trademark use of well-chosen soundtrack songs (from vintage rock to Puccini's operas),The Departedmay not be perfect, but it's one helluva ride for moviegoers, proving popular enough to become the biggest box-office hit of Scorsese's commercially rocky career.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002ZG99N6", "B000P0J09M", "B004SIP7TE", "B004SIP8ZM", "B002ZG980U", "B002VWNIEA", "B00011CZRE", "B00AEBB8NI", "B002T9H2LA", "B00005JLSB", "B000MZHW40", "B00080ZG10", "B003ASLJQS", "B000P0J0AG", "B000P0J0EW", "B000C20VPA", "B003UESJHO", "B004SIP7ZS", "B003ASLJO0", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B002CPMB9O", "B00AHTYI5M", "B00275EGWY", "B000XR9L50", "B000A3XY5A", "B0007DFJ0G", "B001N44BVQ", "B00003CXWV", "B008MILL8W", "B000286RP2", "B004SIP7VM", "B00005V9HH", "6305313687", "B00AEBB9NM", "B004FQX5B6", "B00AEFXKUI", "B004SIP95G", "B00AEBB86A", "B005LAIIJY", "B0016Q2D66", "B003ASLJQI", "B00008975Z", "B000IY04Q8", "B001P9KR8U", "B00005JNJV", "B000C20VRS", "B008R65XYC", "B005LAIGRS", "B00H9KKGTO", "B00008DP4C", "B00AEBB9F0", "B00AEFY5B6", "B00005JN0W", "B005LAIGLE", "B000A2UBN4", "B002QEHPQU", "B000P0J0EM", "B003UESJH4", "B007D5E7C2", "6304765258", "B000P0J0D8", "B00AEFY0XE", "B00004WG2F", "0767830555", "B000LC55F2", "B002O3Z4Y8", "B004EPYZP8", "B000A7DVR2", "B00005JPD0", "B000WZEZGI", "B00049QQHI", "B000FS9FCG", "B00004XPPB", "B006OFN0SE", "B009AMAL4Y", "B004U7MR14", "B000GFLKF8", "B003AWRMCE", "B0019L770A", "B00BEIYN9Q", "B0000AM6JI", "B004SIP9Z6", "B001GZ6QC4", "0783240295", "B0010DR4BO", "B000065U1N", "B00001ZWUS", "B00BB67UNW", "B0000B1OFL", "B00AEBB9K0", "B00DHDDE32", "B00005JKWX", "B0051MKNV8", "B002ZG97RE", "0767802519", "B0034G4P94", "B00DHHWXYY", "B00005B6JZ", "B00003CXZ4", "B001TODCII"], "bought_together": ["B000P0J09M"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000RETOHY", "B000P0J09M", "B000P0J0EW", "B00AEBB8NI"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 5067}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.5, "brand": "Warner Bros", "asin": "B000M341QE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RZnzpL34L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "The French magician and director Georges M&#xE9;li&#xE8;s was arguably the first master of special effects, filling the silent movie houses of the early 20th century with camera trickery that stunned and delighted audiences. A century later, Michel Gondry works very much in the spirit of his artistic predecessor and countryman, creating films and music videos that feel just as hand-crafted and visually fantastical.The Science of Sleepconcerns the flirtations and misunderstandings of St&#xE9;phane (Gael Garc&#xED;a Bernal,Babel), an aspiring visual artist, and St&#xE9;phanie (Charlotte Gainsbourg,21 Grams), his Parisian neighbor who creates whimsical sculptures from cotton balls and felt. As St&#xE9;phane toils in a caustic office for a company that makes calendars, he retreats into his dreams and finds them increasingly hard to distinguish from reality, and vice-versa.The Science of Sleepis a trilingual film, with dialogue spoken in French, English, and Spanish by characters who are very much global citizens, crossing boundaries of consciousness as easily as they cross boundaries of culture. Gondry decorates his love story with deliberately low-tech special effects, including cellophane made to look like bath water and a subconscious television studio constructed largely of corrugated cardboard. This is filmmaking with all the seams and stitches exposed, an appreciation for the patent falseness of films that nonetheless transport and enchant us. It's dreamy.--Ryan Boudinot", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005YU1O", "B00005JMJG", "B0012E2GFK", "B0017RFY56", "B000DWMN2S", "B0000DBJ9J", "B00007AJF8", "B0007UC8Y4", "B0006TPE4C", "B001P3SA8K", "B00005JL57", "B0010X8NF0", "B0000714E6", "B00005JPAR", "B00005JNCZ", "B0000640VJ", "B004SEUIXS", "B00005JLRE", "B000CS464G", "B00000G02H", "B007L6VR12", "B000JMK6LW", "6305428239", "B00005JMJ4", "B0007OCG5G", "B00005N8A9", "B000O76ZQC", "B0007Y08QA", "B006KH6CF4", "B001QOGYBI", "B00000K3TS", "B00005JNC2", "B003KGBISE", "B0000AC8LR", "0767821408", "B00466H3DG", "B005C7SXMS", "0783229526", "B001P3SA8A", "B0057ZAA6W", "B00005JKJA", "B000934FC2", "B00H9HZITU", "B001UV4XC4", "B000MEYKD2", "B000NO1XG8", "B0013K2ZEA", "B0011E5M66", "B001BPJJ9G", "B000KB4898", "B000BX8R10", "B0002I83Z4", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B0016MJ6HY", "B00AEFXESQ", "B00005ATQB", "B001FOK70S", "B00008976Y", "B00DW5IKYS", "B00H9HZGQ0", "B00005Q4CS", "B00GPPXNIK", "B005KKVAHW", "B00JJ3EHCG", "B00008RH3J", "B004SIP6GI", "B001V7RTAK", "B000TZN7KQ", "B001HN69AY", "B000AMJFYA", "B00003CXGA", "078401213X", "B0001GOH6Q", "B0041KKYF6", "B00003CXZ4", "B000H0M4AW", "B00003CXKS", "B000N3T0DW", "B000063JDE", "B00CIOD6HK", "B001UV4XUG", "6305081034", "B00006SFKM", "B000FVQM2Y", "B008RO875Q", "B001B1UO7G", "B0000AZT2X", "B003102JDM", "B00005JLSK", "0783225903", "B0018LX9VC", "B005LLX582", "B001DJ7PQY", "B004499LX0", "B008OHV49W", "B000PKG8TM", "B00000IC7G", "B003498RRW", "B000GBEWNY", "B0064NTZQ2"], "bought_together": ["B00005JMJG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005JMJG", "B00005YU1O", "B0012E2GFK", "B000DWMN2S"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 98633}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 25.0, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B000M4RG7E", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51XHwOA-UIL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Science of Sleep"}
