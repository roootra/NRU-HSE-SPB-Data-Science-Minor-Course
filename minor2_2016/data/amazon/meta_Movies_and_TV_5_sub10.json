{"description": "After several excursions into supernatural horror, Dario Argento returned to the homicidal frenzy that made his reputation with this mystery that plays more like a grown-up slasher movie than a detective thriller. Anthony Franciosa stars as Peter Neal, a bestselling horror novelist whose promotional tour in Italy takes a terrible turn when a mysterious killer re-creates the brutal murders from his book with real-life victims.  The first to die are so-called \"deviants,\" Neal's own friends, and finally there comes a promise that the author himself is next on the list.Columboit ain't, but Argento has always been more concerned with style than story and his execution of the crimes is pure cinematic bravura.  From the simple beauty of a straight razor shattering a light bulb (the camera catches the red-hot filament slowly blacking out) to an ambitious crane shot that creeps up and over the sides of a house under siege in a voyeuristic survey that would make Hitchcock proud, Argento turns the art of murder into a stylish spectacle. He even lets his kinkier side show with flashbacks of an adolescent boy and a teasing dominatrix in red stiletto heels that become a key motif of the film. The objects of Argento's homicidal tendencies are traditionally lovely, scantily clad Italian beauties, and with self-deprecating humor he even inserts a scene in which Neal is taken to task for the misogynist violence of his stories--an accusation Argento himself has weathered for years.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305807426", "6305095566", "6304819927", "630580740X", "B00000F6FN", "0764005685", "6304370458", "6300214087", "6303442315", "6300214192", "6302975832", "0764005707", "B00023NRSM", "6304361025", "6301726383", "6305972060", "B001B1Q3LM", "6305498784", "B002E01MHY", "6301708695", "B002UR4GDI", "630191547X", "6303257879", "B000YKI4U4", "B000TZJCN2"], "bought_together": ["6305807426"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 402377}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 29.99, "brand": "", "asin": "0764005693", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51V45XGPZQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Tenebre [VHS]"}

{"description": "Penny Marshall's popular 1992 comedy sheds light on a little-known chapter of American sports history with its story of a struggling team in the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. The league was formed when the recruiting of soldiers during World War II resulted in a shortage of men's baseball teams. The AAGPBL continued after the war (until 1954), and Marshall's movie depicts the league in full swing, beginning when a savvy baseball scout (Jon Lovitz) finds a pair of promising new players in small-town Oregonian sisters (Geena Davis, Lori Petty). The sisters are signed to play for the Rockford Peaches near Chicago, whose new manager (Tom Hanks) is a former home-run king who wrecked his career with alcoholism. They're all a bunch of underdogs, and Marshall (with a witty script by Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel) does a fine job of establishing a colorful team of supporting players including Madonna and (in her movie debut) Rosie O'Donnell. It's a conventional Hollywood sports story (Marshall's never been one to take dramatic risks), but the stellar cast is delightful, and the movie's filled with memorable moments, witty dialogue, and agreeable sentiment. And just remember: there's no crying in baseball!--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783235968", "630141277X", "6302534372", "0767809262", "6303506291", "B00005M20M", "0792151712"], "also_viewed": ["B000003KMM", "B0012GMZZY", "630596260X", "0783235968", "B00B4804KS"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 393057}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.17, "brand": "", "asin": "076780922X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51A158TD4RL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "A League of Their Own [VHS]"}
{"description": "Lou Diamond Phillips leaves a haunting impression as the late 1950s pop idol Ritchie Valens, who made the Latino influence in rock &amp; roll conspicuous through his hit songs. Filmmaker Luis Valdez (Zoot Suit) creates a nimble, exciting, and sympathetic portrait of the boy driven to rise above obstacles of race and family legacy, and Esai Morales is equally fine as Ritchie's envious, searching brother. Great support from Elizabeth Pe&ntilde;a and Danielle von Zerneck as Valens's sister and mother, respectively, and Joe Pantoliano is solid as the singer's straight-talking manager. Valdez brightens up the third act with a rock &amp; roll show featuring, among others, Brian Setzer as Eddie Cochrane. Marshall Crenshaw turns up as Buddy Holly getting on that plane with Valens, and Los Lobos (who actually performs Valens's music on the soundtrack) has a nifty cameo as a Tijuana band that gives Valens a piece of crucial inspiration.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000P0J0CY", "B0001CNQX0", "B00000K3TX", "B00004RJ71", "B0002DRDIW", "B0000714BS", "B0000714BQ", "B000002LC8", "B003NF97NK", "0783114907", "B00180IPM6", "B00007J5VO", "B005HFI7IU", "B003E1QDAI", "B00004ZESY", "B000K2UGZM", "B000AM4P90", "B00AEBB9IM", "B0009R1TJ0", "B00005N89M", "B002WJHBCC", "B00AEFY5TI", "B000KJU15U", "B000063JDI", "B00465I1CE", "B000RHRGSK", "B002XUBDRY", "B00AEBB9ZK", "B003VA3JZY", "B00EE8AIW4", "6305428409", "B000GJ0LLI", "B0042837D8", "B0009IOR6Q", "B00AEFXZJE", "B0000DIXDR", "B004AOECXI", "B000K2Q7CI", "B0009HLC9W", "B00004Y2R1", "B00CAYH200", "6305428271", "B000065V3H", "B001GD6VTE", "B00441GYZG", "B001AEF6BS", "B0042EJDGM", "B000B74GCA", "0767821769", "B001D0T4JY", "0767812387", "B000P0J0C4", "B00009AOBI", "0800141806", "B000E8QVWY", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00005V9IA", "B0002VGTBQ", "0783228686", "B00006FDCD", "6305428050", "B00006RCOC", "B000N3T0HI", "B00AEFXP8K", "B00E1HIX66", "6305744793", "B00009AOAX", "B00008L3U1", "B00AMSS3TA", "B000E8QVBU", "B00005JND5", "B000ERVK3A", "B00081U7HC", "B00AEFY4CG", "B00AEFY5B6", "B0002VEZ3U", "B000FOPPC4", "B008IG0F4Y", "B001DJLD12", "B00003CXPS", "B000068TPB", "B00069FL7C", "B004IKZQPW", "B00158K0R4", "B000H5TH20", "B00AEFXPG2", "B00AEBBADG", "B001BGS16W", "B00003CXTG", "B0002TT0MI", "B0087F7VSY", "B0000AQS5F", "076780421X", "0767812182", "B002BIULKS", "6305213305", "B00004TJKK", "B00027JZ3E", "B00075VX2C", "B00006RZ9Y"], "bought_together": ["B000P0J0CY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00004RJ71", "B000P0J0CY", "B000A50460", "B0001CNQX0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 8913}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.99, "brand": "Philips", "asin": "0767821637", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51R7P26XWQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "La Bamba"}

{"description": "SLC Punkstarts out entertainingly enough as a sarcastic snapshot of the punk-rock scene in Salt Lake City in 1985--complete with mohawks, moshing, and vague avowals of anarchy. But gradually, the wanderings of Stevo (Matthew Lillard fromScream) and Heroin Bob (Michael Goorjian) turn into a multilayered exploration of character and culture shock. Though he spends his days drinking and mocking the values of his parents, Stevo turns just as critical an eye on his own rhetoric and lifestyle, and comes to find that aimless rebellion may be just as hollow as the mindless pursuit of money. No character has the right point of view; there are no easy solutions. Despite lacking anything in the way of a plot,SLC Punksustains its energy through wit, realism, propulsive editing, and excellent performances from Lillard, Goorjian, and the rest of the cast. It's emblematic of the movie's sophistication that Stevo's lawyer father (Christopher McDonald, who played Geena Davis's  husband inThelma and Louise) is treated satirically without being dismissed; though baffled by his son's form of rebellion, he never loses hope that Stevo will go on to law school and continues to cajole Stevo and argue with him about how the world works. By its end, the constantly shifting perspective ofSLC Punkachieves a surprising emotional depth. It's also given a lot of energy by a well-chosen soundtrack of energetic but not overly familiar music of the time, including selections from Fear, the Dead Kennedys, the Stooges, and even Roxy Music.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783228317", "B000059PR8", "B00005T33W", "0792839641", "6304297912"], "also_viewed": ["B00005JM23", "B00006G8O1"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 386721}, "asin": "0767835980", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5177E0S0XPL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Slc Punk [VHS]"}

{"description": "Once upon a time, in the 1980s and early 1990s, American independent movies did not seek to merely ape Hollywood formulas. They were more than just feature-length resumes for shrewd, enterprising filmmakers who had nothing to say, but dreamed of saying it with a big-studio budget. Back then, independent films provided a different kind of movie experience; they challenged and provoked audiences--and none more so than 1991'sThe Rapture, written and directed by Michael Tolkin, the man who wrote the screenplay forThe Player, Robert Altman's scathing anti-Hollywood comedy. Mimi Rogers plays Sharon, a lost soul who gives up her hedonistic life of sex and drugs when she finds God and becomes a fundamentalist Christian fanatic. Her pilgrim's progress, presented in a deadpan, nonjudgmental style, culminates quite literally in the title event--the Second Coming, the Apocalypse, the end of the world, or whatever you want to call it. Rogers's fearless performance becomes all the more provocative when you recall that the actress is a lifelong member of the Church of Scientology.The Raptureis a mind-boggling, wildly ambitious movie that's open to myriad interpretations.

It becomes a battle to the death (yes, Immortals can die), and Lambert seeks survival training from an Immortal mentor played by Sean Connery. Dazzling, energetic, and altogether confusing in its original form, the film has since been released on video, laserdisc, and DVD in this revised widescreen &quot;director's cut,&quot; with additional footage, director and producers' commentary, a photo and artwork archive, the original trailer, and an official time line of the film's evolution from script to screen.

In the year 1999, Lambert owns a corporation that has created a shield to protect the Earth following the depletion of the ozone layer. But the shield is seized by an evil cartel, and Virginia Madsen plays a scientist who assists MacLeod in his mission to destroy the cartel. Sean Connery also reprises his role fromHighlanderas the Scottish Immortal named Ramirez (?!), but by the time he starts engaging in dashing swordplay you may wonder if he's wandered in from another movie altogether.Highlanderfans welcomed the laserdisc and DVD release of this &quot;renegade&quot; director's cut, which attempts to clarify the original version's confusing plot.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004U7MQY2", "B004U7MQYC", "B001JFZ118", "B0010YVCAM", "B000NOKAK8", "B0007DA3V6", "B00092A1J4", "B000OYCMNU", "B001URA5W0", "B000LP6L2U", "B001AQO3XS", "B00006LPCK", "B0001BKBGQ", "B00HEPDGKA", "B00005O5B6", "B00009MEJT", "B0000CABIJ", "B00020HCBI", "0790738511", "B008JFUS0U", "B00IKM5LXG", "B0085A9HU6", "B0001ZX0GA", "B0001NBLYK", "B004P7CMDM", "0783225741", "B00J4LMHMK", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B00EKUXDSW", "B00004WEJZ", "B008JFUNHI", "B00J9BZ4KC", "B0000640VR", "B001B3LIOC", "B00070FX5U", "B00006RCOC", "B005LAIGW8", "B005LAII44", "B00005N5S5", "6304711891", "B0013RF25M", "B001FB55HQ", "B00003CXIV", "B00004Y631", "B0090SI56Y", "B0001A9I5W", "B001BEK8HO", "B0053TWVIM", "B00004STDN", "B0000VD12I", "B003L20IEW", "B000UW1NKE", "B0000VCZK2", "6304936532", "B00A2H9OSK", "B000QUCRB4", "B000M2DLJ8", "6305558167", "B003QO8TOQ", "B000AYELFQ", "0783225814", "1573624667", "B00BUAEYVK", "B000P7V4R6", "0783226888", "B00AIBZKV0", "B005LS4MQY", "B000VI70QS", "6304712499", "B0045HCJ9O", "B004LWZW4M", "B00004TJJV", "B00HDU9UOW", "0783114885", "0767817710", "B000E6ESEY", "B0045HCIWM", "B0045HCJRG", "B00GJNQ4B6", "6305245487", "B002O3Z4WK", "B0000844I8", "B0006UEVUE", "630469654X", "B00AZMFJYA", "B00009ATIM", "B008Y1YK9Y", "B0000524EB", "0783226063", "B0001Z37HM", "B00003CXC5", "B000U1ZV8K", "B0050ODZ6M", "B00008G8M4", "B000LC4Z7Q", "B004EPYZT4", "B00008WFU5", "076780970X", "B00F3L8P26"], "bought_together": ["B001JFZ118", "B004U7MQY2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001JFZ118", "B004U7MQY2", "B004U7MQYC", "B0010YVCAM"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 273607}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 24.99, "brand": "", "asin": "0782008380", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516F7VY0HCL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Highlander II: Renegade Version"}

{"description": "Hoo-ah! After seven Oscar nominations for his outstanding work in films such asThe Godfather,Serpico, andDog Day Afternoon, it's ironic that Al Pacino finally won the Oscar for his grandstanding lead performance in this 1992 crowd pleaser. As the blind, blunt, and ultimately benevolent retired Lieutenant Colonel Frank Slade, Pacino is both hammy and compelling, simultaneously subtle and grandly over-the-top when defending his new assistant and prep school student Charlie (Chris O'Donnell) at a disciplinary hearing. While the subplot involving Charlie's prep-school crisis plays like a sequel toDead Poets Society, Pacino's adventurous escapades in New York City provide comic relief, rich character development, and a memorable supporting role for Gabrielle Anwar as the young woman who accepts the colonel's invitation to dance the tango.Scent of a Womanis a remake of the 1972 Italian filmProfumo di donna. In addition to Pacino's award, the picture garnered Oscar nominations for director Martin Brest and for screenwriter Bo Goldman.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0790734079", "630445600X", "6303402070", "6304259131", "0800125762", "B000007OY0", "B00004WIDB", "0800100832", "6303486746", "6302415853", "6301697758", "6301578805", "0783235607", "6303269834"], "bought_together": ["0790734079"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 307456}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.83, "brand": "Scent Of A Woman", "asin": "0783204914", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514CEATZ0DL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Scent of a Woman [VHS]"}
{"description": "Now you can achieve multiple viewings of the bestSexon TV.  Winner of Golden Globes for Best TV Series and Best Actress,Sex and the Cityis based on Candace Bushnell's provocativebestselling book. Sarah Jessica  Parker stars as Carrie Bradshaw, a self-described \"sexual anthropologist,\" who writes \"Sex and the City,\" a newspaper column that chronicles the state of sexual affairs of Manhattanites in this \"age of un-innocence.\" Her \"posse,\" including nice girl Charlotte (Kristin Davis), hard-edged Miranda (Cynthia Nixon), and party girl  Samantha (Kim Cattrall)--not to mention her own tumultuous love life--gives Carrie plenty of column fodder. Over the course of the first season's 12&nbsp;episodes, the most prominent dramatic arc concerns Carrie, who goes from turning the tables on \"toxic bachelors\" by having \"sex like a man\" to wanting to join the ranks of \"the monogamists\" with the elusive Mr.&nbsp;Big (Chris Noth). Meanwhile, Miranda, Cynthia, and Samantha have their own dating woes, few of which can be described on a family Web site.Seinfeldhas nothing onSex and the Citywhen it comes to shallow, self-absorbed characters or coining catch phrases. Episode&nbsp;2, for example, introduces the term \"modelizer\": a guy who is obsessed with and will only date models. Some may accuse this series of male bashing. But women, after years of enduring shows with \"men behaving badly,\" will relish the equal time. Some may blanch at the ladies' graphic language and ribald humor, or dismiss some of the situations as unrealistic (Carrie doesn't bat an eye when she discovers that an artist friend surreptitiously videotapes his sexual conquests). Still others will viewSex and the Cityas documentary. Regardless of your view, this groundbreaking series will have you longing for more.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005AVCB", "B000063TQT", "B00008MTVM", "B0000DC151", "B00382S9T6", "B00382S9SW", "B00382S9TQ", "B00005AVCA", "B0002SDY1W", "B0000DBJ2E", "B00005YU82", "B000068CNY", "B000CNGCAW", "B000CNGCAM"], "bought_together": ["B00005AVCB", "B000063TQT"], "also_viewed": ["B00005AVCB", "B000063TQT", "B001DDBCUA", "B002ZG98Z0", "B0011UBDTK", "B003Z8ZCG6", "B006WZIB1C"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 169044}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 4.95, "brand": "", "asin": "0783117388", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51SJ6990M8L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Sex and the City - The Complete First Season [VHS]"}
{"description": "In the vastly overrated 1998 bookEasy Riders, Raging Bulls, author Peter Biskind puts the blame for Hollywood's blockbuster mentality at least partially on Steven Spielberg's box-office success with this adaptation of Peter Benchley's bestselling novel. But you can't blame Spielberg for making a terrific movie, whichJawsdefinitely is. The story of a Long Island town whose summer tourist business is suddenly threatened by great-white-shark attacks on humans bypasses the potboiler trappings of Benchley's book and goes straight for the jugular with beautifully crafted, crowd-pleasing sequences of action and suspense supported by a trio of terrific performances by Roy Scheider (as the local sheriff), Richard Dreyfuss (as a shark specialist), and particularly Robert Shaw (as the old fisherman who offers to hunt the shark down). The sequences on Shaw's boat--as the three of them realize that in fact the shark is huntingthem--are what entertaining moviemaking is all about.--Marshall Fine", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005B6ND", "6300183181", "0784011923", "0767825411", "6305814694", "B00000JGEI", "6303148352", "6303506291", "630018403X", "B00000490M", "6300214753", "6304932553", "630442972X", "6300269639", "B0000048S1", "B000005PFL", "6302765536", "6302091632", "6302824729", "6303344224", "6301570723", "6300247171", "B00008WFU5", "6305576173", "6300183467", "0790743213", "6304143184", "6303402348", "1558808221", "6303020089", "B000063UUL", "B00005B238", "6303212379", "B00005A8XX", "0790731436", "0783226152", "0790705141", "6300267881", "B00008WFU4", "6300181340", "630157401X", "6302921058", "6300214060", "6302968143", "1558802258", "0792102320", "6300214087", "6300268993", "B0000BWVBD", "B002GHHHL0", "6301888901", "B00005JKDQ", "6303122647", "6302800420", "6303610811", "6301827732", "6303540082", "6302374189", "0800198395", "6300214435", "6304071876", "6301208773", "B00000IO4G", "B00006G8LB", "B0087ZG7HK", "B00008DZ83", "6300214710", "6300215814", "630220366X", "6304457324", "0800116917", "B000059XY5", "6303212263", "6300216500", "6303236863", "630533577X", "6300213986", "6302415853", "6304935811", "6302820448", "B00004U8P4", "6300214311", "6301798503", "0793927501", "6300214370", "6302787564", "6304288433", "6300182878", "B000003KHS", "6301971809", "B000007OY0", "0790734079", "630336568X", "0790733927", "0790742322", "6301966988", "0764006770", "B000059XVO", "B00023BLXA"], "also_viewed": ["B00008WFU5", "6301792734", "6305814694", "B00005B6ND", "0784011923", "0767825411", "6300214060", "6300183181", "6300247171", "B00005A8XX", "6303506291", "B00006AL1C", "0792151712", "6304539258", "630018403X", "6305363668", "B00008WFU4", "B00000JGEI", "B00078XGO2", "6304117752", "6301574117", "0800116917", "B000005PPB", "B0056BE0SG", "6302091632", "080010367X", "6304143184", "6300216845", "6304539274", "6303148352", "0792158261", "B00000JS61", "0792839846", "6303212379", "0792837614", "0783222955", "0783221347", "0790700506", "6302921058", "6301797906", "6301976983", "6305123616", "6303402070", "6304429274", "1558807780", "B00005JKDQ", "6300214370", "6302936381", "B00000JGEK", "B0000AQZYM", "B00000JXVM", "B0007KTBIU", "0790734079", "6304039522", "6300214753", "B00005NCCP", "B005FHWWXQ", "B0087F7VSY", "B00KDU8HQQ"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 177995}, "asin": "0783216084", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514JQY1K3TL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Jaws [VHS]"}
{"description": "Director Martin Scorsese reunites with members of hisGoodFellasgang (writer Nicholas Pileggi; actors Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, and Frank Vincent) for a three-hour epic about the rise and fall of mobster Sam &quot;Ace&quot; Rothstein (De Niro), a character based on real-life gangster Frank &quot;Lefty&quot; Rosenthal. (It's modeled after onWiseguyandGoodFellasand Pileggi's true crime bookCasino: Love and Honor in Las Vegas.)  Through Rothstein, the picture tells the story of how the Mafia seized, and finally lost control of, Las Vegas gambling. The first hour plays like a fascinating documentary, intricately detailing the inner workings of Vegas casinos. Sharon Stone is the stand out among the actors; she nabbed an Oscar nomination for her role as the voracious Ginger, the glitzy call girl who becomes Rothstein's wife. The film is not as fast paced or gripping as Scorsese's earlier gangster pictures (Mean StreetsandGoodFellas), but it's still absorbing. And, hey--it's Scorsese!--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000P0J09M", "B000C20VRS", "B00004XPPB", "B000P0J0AG", "B0000AM6JI", "B0006GAOJA", "B0019L770A", "B0019L21GA", "B00003CXWV", "0767830555", "B000286RP2", "B0018CMJSU", "B000M341QE", "B004SIP7TE", "B002CPMB9O", "B00AEBB9NM", "B00004U103", "B0000DI87S", "B00008975Z", "B00013RC2U", "B00CCMKPO0", "B0019L21H4", "B000A2UBN4", "B006TTC5HC", "B004SIP95G", "B007TBIUSM", "B002QEHPQU", "B000H5TH20", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00005V9HH", "B00G1C2URC", "B00011CZRE", "B002VWNIEA", "B002T9H2LA", "B0000AMJEK", "B0001FGBUW", "B000P0J0EW", "B000A7DVR2", "6305313687", "B004G7XCRQ", "B000P0J0D8", "B000LP6KNU", "B0007DFJ0G", "1558908390", "B000P0J09C", "B00080ZG10", "B00005B6JZ", "B000CNESTE", "B004FQX5B6", "B000067IZ3", "B004U7MR14", "0783229526", "B00H9KKGTO", "B00008RH3L", "B0018CWW5K", "B002CA68N4", "B00562D3Y2", "B006X08FGW", "B007D5E7C2", "B000SFOW8I", "B008R65XYC", "B00005ATQB", "B00001ZWUS", "B000EHSVRI", "B00AEFXESQ", "B0009A40ES", "B002ZG99N6", "B003ELKNH2", "B000OT6V0K", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B000002OZ9", "B000MZHW40", "B00AEFXKUI", "B004L9GMBC", "B00006RCNV", "B000PAAJZ6", "B001JIE7JC", "B00AEBB95K", "B004SIP93S", "B000E5KQHI", "B00IEK9U0E", "B0000AMRJE", "B000ZM1MGE", "B000QEIOT4", "B0041QSZS8", "B000093FLA", "B0000YEE6M", "B002VWNIDG", "B00029RTAI", "B002NZK5QO", "B00AEBB9CS", "B00079Z9VO", "B00AEBB8LA", "B007SPPANM", "B000035Z5G", "B00004XPPG", "079284646X", "B000FI8MPW", "B003AWRMCE", "B00AEFY0F2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000P0J09M", "B000C20VRS", "B008R65XYC", "B000M341QE"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 158336}, "asin": "0783225792", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/712YQJ017YL._SY300_.gif", "title": "Casino"}
{"description": "A movie that only true horror buffs could love,Army of Darknessis officially part 3 in the wild and wacky Evil Dead trilogy masterminded by the perversely inventive director Sam Raimi, who would later serve as executive producer of the popular syndicated TV seriesHercules: The Legendary Journeys.Raimi's favorite actor, Bruce Campbell, returns as Ash (hero of the first two Evil Dead flicks), a hardware-store clerk who is magically transported--along with his beat-up Oldsmobile and a chainsaw attachment for his severed left forearm--to the brutal battlefields of the 14th century. He quickly assumes power (who else in the Middle Ages packs a shotgun and a chainsaw?), and unites his band of medieval knights against the dreaded Army of the Dead. Raimi gleefully subverts almost every horror-movie clich&eacute; as he serves up a nonstop parade of blood, gore, and vicious sword-bearing skeletons--an affectionate homage to animator Ray Harryhausen's classicJason and the Argonauts. The frantic action is fun while it lasts, but even at 80 minutesArmy of Darknessnearly wears out its welcome. You know that Raimi can maintain the mayhem for only so long before it grows tiresome, and fortunately this madcap movie quits while it's ahead.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B005J9ZFQG", "B000WC3864", "B008JFUNYG", "B001KEGR5M", "B0001LQJMQ", "B003S6S7TY", "B004GGU9K0", "B000QUCQX8", "B008CYDD7I", "B005J9ZE5I", "B00C6F61IW", "B004GGU9JQ", "B00004Y87O", "B000WC38FA", "B000AQ69QS", "B0006A9FKA", "B00IF8Q0YE", "B0013D8LAE", "B000RIWAVW", "B0002C9DK4", "B000F7CMPE", "B0001611DI", "B0000AOX0F", "B002LMSWN2", "B000FS9FE4", "B0002CHK1S", "157362408X", "B000IJ7A5Q", "B002GHHHG0", "B00D7AM6M0", "B000I2J68M", "B00009MGEM", "B001NPD9LS", "B00AQJ8MLY", "B000VKL6Z2", "B004SIP6LS", "B00007AJG4", "B002JT69IW", "0790729342", "B0009OUBC4", "B00005JA8B", "B001D5C1OO", "B000V4UFZK", "B00005LC4Q", "B0056P6SOG", "B004P7CMOQ", "B000UAE7O0", "B000WC389G", "B0016MJ6P6", "B000I0RNVQ", "B008WAM2E2", "B0001US7OA", "B00005N5RM", "B00AEFY2WI", "B000FJH5MC", "B000099T3M", "B004EI2NP4", "B00005JO16", "B008G33PIM", "B001DJLD1W", "B000TSIJWY", "B001DJLD0S", "B000AXWHSA", "B000FA57UI", "B00AEFXW8I", "B00018D42W", "B000068IEV", "B000S0GYRU", "B000FA57US", "6304712499", "B001B8XRT6", "B002VWNIDG", "B002OVO18A", "B0002ABURA", "B00006FDCD", "B00AEFYDM2", "B0028DRGDQ", "B008874968", "B0000AOX09", "B001KEGR5W", "B0000VCZNE", "0312291450", "B0087ZG7UW", "B0024FAG44", "B0053TWV46", "B0058I9DZM", "B003VMFWXO", "B003WTO5NO", "B0015U0QWG", "B004XVMCH6", "B004LWZW24", "B001B1UO6W", "B005HI4LMS", "B000LP6KNU", "B004SIP9Z6", "B00317LM8S", "B0031U8OEK", "B0024FADBA", "B000C20VRS"], "bought_together": ["B005J9ZFQG", "B000WC3864"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005J9ZFQG", "B00005R24K", "B008JFUNYG", "B009JBWOU0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 22777}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.74, "brand": "Universal Studios", "asin": "0783227434", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DQ0H428VL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Army of Darkness"}

{"description": "Arnold Schwarzenegger as a pregnant man? The Terminator with cramps and morning sickness? That was  all the teasing audiences needed to flock to this 1994 farce, which reunited Arnold with his director and costar fromTwins, Ivan Reitman and Danny De&nbsp;Vito. Reitman had also directed the Austrian muscleman inKindergarten Cop, and they brought the same breezy quality of those earlier films to this enjoyable fluff, in  which Arnold plays a scientist who uses his own body to test a revolutionary new fertility drug. His colleague De Vito  talks him into the experiment, which succeeds beyond their wildest expectations when Arnold begins a full-term  pregnancy. Emma Thompson offers a wealth of comedic support as the biologist who moves into Schwarzenegger's lab  while he's coping with his \"maternal\" condition, and Pamela Reed (who was also inKindergarten Cop) adds to  the fun as De&nbsp;Vito's pregnant ex-wife. What's surprising about this mainstream hit is not that it makes the most of  its absurd premise, but that it's also sweetly heartwarming in its treatment of role reversal and the joys and pains of  pregnancy. It's a good-natured vehicle for a different side of Schwarzenegger's star appeal, and the fact that it works at  all is a tribute to Reitman and his cleverly talented cast.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783226926", "0783225504", "B00005T7I2", "B0002J58HO", "6305767866", "B000056PMU", "B00013RC8E", "0767804309", "B000TJBN6W", "B00005T7I3", "B00004XMSC", "B00026ZG10", "B005XB8SRS", "B0001Z37HM", "B000068QPM", "B002GHHHME", "B00HZMZ2FE", "B000Y11B7Q", "B00005JKIP", "0783225946", "B001LMAK9C", "B00AKGG828", "6305803781", "B0000VD12I", "B00005T7HZ", "B000RJO56E", "B00008979F", "B000RW3VCK", "B00005N5S5", "B00000IQW2", "B00008977A", "B00070FX5U", "B000089771", "B00JVLGL2A", "B00AEFXPG2", "B0087ZG7NO", "B0000542C9", "B000063INF", "B00K8HALVI", "0767802497", "B00AMEZDN8", "B0000VV5BM", "0783241895", "B00386EZKE", "B00K8HAKSW", "0800177029", "B00018YC3M", "B00008L3S9", "B001VLBDD0", "B00HSSZKAW", "6305236569", "0783235070", "6305213305", "B008KEQMDC", "B000QQLVPQ", "B001OST0M6", "B000FC2FQA", "B00081U7HC", "1558908404", "B00020HAXI", "B00006AW63", "B00AEBB9WI", "B0006J28MI", "6305428395", "B00441GYQ0", "B00HLTD49C", "B002XUBDRY", "B00HQOFAKI", "B000E6ESI0", "0767807588", "0783226896", "B000TZJBPQ", "B0006GANOQ", "0783227396", "B00441GYY2", "B000IJ79X4", "B001G7Q0M8", "0767821769", "B000BUE5E6", "B001TK80C0", "B00BTYJYP8", "B001L2ZSJO", "B00008L3U1", "B007R915RE", "B0007GGYUC", "B001CQONNG", "B004X1M47O", "6305428549", "B0000DKDUV", "B000065V43", "B0009UZG3C", "B00009AOBM", "B004X1M3DE", "B000068MC1", "B000BPL2FQ", "0792844866", "B00008G8LY", "B00H1RMWYW", "B003UESJEW", "B002LFAHBE"], "bought_together": ["0783226926", "0783225504"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000RJO56E", "0783225504", "0783226926", "0800177975"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 46614}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.99, "brand": "UNIVERSAL", "asin": "0783230370", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51VBRQ7VGVL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Junior"}

{"description": "Alfred Hitchcock considered this 1943 thriller to be his personal favorite among his own films, and although it's not as popular as some of Hitchcock's later work, it's certainly worthy of the master's admiration. Scripted by playwright Thornton Wilder and inspired by the actual case of a 1920's serial killer known as \"The Merry Widow Murderer,\" the movie sets a tone of menace and fear by introducing a psychotic killer into the small-town comforts of Santa Rosa, California. That's where young Charlie (Teresa Wright) lives with her parents and two younger siblings, and where murder is little more than a topic of morbid conversation for their mystery-buff neighbor (Hume Cronyn). Charlie was named after her favorite uncle, who has just arrived for an extended visit, and at first Uncle Charlie (Joseph Cotten) gets along famously with his admiring niece. But the film's chilling prologue has already revealed Uncle Charlie's true identity as the notorious Merry Widow Murderer, and the suspense grows almost unbearable when young Charlie's trust gives way to gradual dread and suspicion. Through narrow escapes and a climactic scene aboard a speeding train, this witty thriller strips away the fa&ccedil;ade of small-town tranquility to reveal evil where it's least expected. And, of course, it's all done in pure Hitchcockian style.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300183580", "6304039530", "1558807780", "6301670140", "0783221347", "0783235593", "6301798503", "0783235623", "6304039506", "6301975987", "630197350X", "6304429274", "6304359705", "6304457316", "6304119046", "6300183513", "6301798732", "6300215644", "6302909023", "B0000040EO", "630150528X", "0783222955", "6305123616", "0783217390", "0783235607", "6302278929", "6301797957", "6301798260", "B003MG6FJY", "0783235674", "6300158438", "6300215741", "6301564456", "0783235704", "6301327845", "6301586042", "6301800974", "B000003KE0", "0790733897", "6303020089", "0782008348", "6301977149", "6301969316", "6300183912", "6303364772", "6303957013", "1558804226", "6301973410", "B00004TX24", "6300988791", "630266232X", "6301973259", "6301670159", "0800100832", "0790743213", "6301640667", "6301969049", "B00004TYS8", "630196912X", "6302878535", "6302120101", "6300269264", "B00007JME0", "6302299497", "6302360978", "6300181421", "630160086X", "6302484421", "6302413435", "6300181340", "6302779782", "6302305942", "B0002IXSVI", "6301586026", "B00003OSTO", "0783235615", "6301964012", "079284517X", "0792837096", "B00000FZXC", "6302226899", "0783235682", "6300208133", "6301972171", "6302884705", "6302503493", "6302801133", "6303039693", "6304308418", "630196571X", "6301967682", "1558808590", "6303560067", "6305012792", "6300181723", "B000GX7MMA", "6303333079", "6301955625", "6301977815"], "bought_together": ["6300183580", "6301670140"], "also_viewed": ["6300183580", "6301670140"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 168467}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.5, "brand": "", "asin": "0783236352", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51K145Q7XJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Shadow of a Doubt [VHS]"}

{"description": "This is the film that cemented Schwarzenegger's spot in the action-brawn firmament, and it was well deserved. He's chilling as the futuristic cyborg who kills without fear, without love, without mercy. James Cameron's story and direction are pared to the bone and all the more creepy. But don't overlook the contributions of Linda Hamilton, who more than holds her own as the Terminator's would-be victim, Sarah Connor--thus creating, along with Sigourney Weaver inAlien, a new generation of rugged, clear-thinking female action stars. It's surprising how well this film holds up, and how its minimalist, malevolent violence is actually way scarier than that of its far more expensive, more effects-laden sequel.--Anne Hurley", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00000JGEI", "0767825411", "0783216084", "630442972X", "B00000490M", "B00005B238", "6300269639", "6303506291", "B0000048S1", "6301570723", "6300214753", "6300183181", "6303344224", "6302824729", "6305814694", "630018403X", "6302765536", "6302091632", "6304932553", "0790731436", "1558802258", "B00005B6ND", "6300248089", "6300213005", "6300189015", "6300213668", "1558808221", "6302822688", "0792845684", "B00000K2SC", "6303446590", "6303020089", "6300214826", "6300989003", "B000059XY5", "6300271331", "B000067CZY", "6303148352", "B001VLBDD0", "B00000ILE6", "B00005JA8B", "B00000JGEK", "6300214087", "6303212263", "6300183211", "B0000BWVBD", "6303540082", "6301827732", "6302374189", "0790731975", "B000059XXZ", "B0000CDL3W", "0790705141", "B00006AL1C", "6305363668", "6300214710", "0792844890", "6300263673", "B00005JLTM", "6301666569", "B00006G8LB", "630196666X", "6303347657", "6304214502", "0790701251", "6304509154", "6300214060", "6300215814", "0783226152", "B0001DI5W6", "B00008DZ83", "6301977815", "6304508611", "6300183467", "6304765789", "B00003CXE6", "6302814782", "6301977742", "B00000J2KZ", "6300182878", "6302415853", "0792835077", "0792836634", "6301976622", "0790742322", "6305576173", "0790733897", "B00023NRSM", "6301574117", "6303236863", "6300214370", "B00001ZWTS", "6301208773", "B00000JGEN", "0792158261", "6300987744", "6302032377", "0780622545", "630196733X"], "bought_together": ["B00000JGEI"], "also_viewed": ["B001RIY4WE", "B00005B238", "B00000JGEI", "6303506291", "0783216084", "0767825411", "6300214060", "6301792734", "6303148352", "6300214540", "080010367X", "B00000490M", "0792158261", "6305363668", "B00000JS61", "6301208773", "6305123616", "6305750750", "6304539258", "6303212263", "6305095566", "6302091632", "6303313345", "0790734079", "6300213005", "0790700506", "B0008JIJ2E", "B00004R99N", "6302824729", "6301792769", "080013558X", "0790705141", "6300248089", "630336568X", "B00G0OHMUG", "6304007523", "B00003CXC5", "6303566634", "B000Q66J1M", "B00GST8UB8", "B001DZFYPW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 310948}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.5, "brand": "", "asin": "0784011923", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510R8ADFV0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Terminator [VHS]"}

{"description": "This 1989 drama penned by pre-Basic Instinctscreenwriter Joe Eszterhas is a powerful tale of family identity and loyalty threatened by a ghost from the Third Reich. Jessica Lange stars as a Chicago criminal attorney whose beloved immigrant father (Armin Mueller-Stahl, in his American film debut) is accused of once having been a monstrous SS officer for Hitler. While Lange's character does a good job defending the old man in court against witnesses who charge him with numerous unspeakable acts, her own certainty that  he is innocent slowly crumbles, leaving her with a horrifying personal dilemma. Directed by Costa-Gavras (Z), the film displays some of his distracting tendency toward unnecessarily broad storytelling, but Eszterhas's script is disciplined and moving, and Lange and Mueller-Stahl are stunning in their depiction of a loving relationship deeply shaken by history.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B00006349J"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 488600}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.96, "brand": "", "asin": "0784011486", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31BE03EB0SL.gif", "title": "Music Box [VHS]"}
{"description": "It always comes up when people are comparing their most traumatic movie experiences: \"the death of Bambi's mother,\" a recollection that can bring a shudder to even the most jaded filmgoer. That primal separation (which is no less stunning for happening off-screen) is the centerpiece ofBambi, Walt Disney's 1942 animated classic, but it is by no means the only bold stroke in the film. In its swift but somehow leisurely 69 minutes,Bambicovers a year in the life of a young deer. But in a bigger way, it measures the life cycle itself, from birth to adulthood, from childhood's freedom to grown-up responsibility. All of this is rendered in cheeky, fleet-footed style--the movie doesn't lecture, or make you feel you're being fed something that's good for you. The animation is miraculous, a lush forest in which nature is a constantly unfolding miracle (even in a spectacular fire, or those dark moments when \"man was in the forest\"). There are probably easier animals to draw than a young deer, and the Disney animators set themselves a challenge with Bambi's wobbly glide across an ice-covered lake, his spindly legs akimbo; but the sequence is effortless and charming. If Bambi himself is just a bit dull--such is the fate of an Everydeer--his rabbit sidekick Thumper and a skunk named Flower more than make up for it. Many of the early Disney features have their share of lyrical moments and universal truths, butBambiis so simple, so pure, it's almost transparent. You might borrow a phrase from Thumper and say it's downright twitterpated.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["155890641X", "0788812807", "6302642248", "0788802194", "6302320402", "6304401132", "078881172X", "6304500831", "6303314015", "6300274195", "0788812408", "6302526574", "6302787068", "6302961572", "6300274268", "6305229449", "6303983812", "0788803743", "6304089767", "B0000AQZYM", "B000035Z2S", "6305319138", "6300275310", "0788805843", "0788805533", "6303929338", "6302158095", "6302178924", "6304100507", "B00005JKDQ", "6304400551", "6305326940", "6304290888", "6304978286", "6304400225", "6305940932", "B00004R99N", "6303036813", "6301390725", "B00003CX7L", "B0000E32WB", "6304089201", "B00000ICHA", "B000B8QG3G", "B0000524CZ", "6302426200", "6304501153", "B00003CXQX", "B00005T7H6", "1558906150", "6300274608", "B00000JS61", "6303534422", "B0009SUS4Q", "6304400381", "B00004R99I", "B000009CTR", "6302484359", "6301991311", "B00005RDVV", "B0007A2GSM", "B00003CXHR", "0788811002", "B000035Z46", "B00005RRG3", "6300276554", "6303122647", "6303123244", "6304401736", "0788812181", "B00006IUM9", "1558901892", "6301948106", "6305942285", "6300277003", "B00003CWPW", "6304015127", "B00007AJLB", "B00005JL95", "0788810634", "6304873441", "6303295614", "6303939015", "0783236689", "6304117752", "B00016JF2W", "B000BAVLYS", "0788812440", "B0002YLCHE", "6302481805", "6304155972", "6303991408", "B00008Y47S", "B00003CXXI", "B000B8QG4A", "6302961661", "B00003CXQ6", "B0001I55VK", "B00004YNUH"], "bought_together": ["155890641X", "0788802194"], "also_viewed": ["155890641X", "0788802194", "6303314015", "0788812408", "6304500831", "6302526574", "6302320402", "078881172X", "6302642248", "6302787068", "0788812807", "6300274195", "6304401132", "6302961572", "6304089767", "6300274268", "0788805843", "B000035Z2S", "6304290888", "0788805533", "6305319138", "6303983812", "6305229449", "6303929338", "6300275310", "6302178924", "6304400551", "B0000AQZYM", "6302158095", "6303534422", "B00005JKDQ", "B0007KTBIU", "6305326940", "B00003CXQX", "6304501153", "6303036813", "B000B8QG3G", "6304100507", "B00004R99N", "6305940932", "B00003CXHR", "6304978286", "B000035Z46", "B00005JL95", "B00005RDVV", "B005JQFQ5Y", "B00003CX7L", "6304873441", "6304089201", "6304400225", "6302426200", "6301991311", "6304401736", "0788811002", "B0000524CZ", "6300274608", "6301390725", "B00016JF2W", "B00004REYY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 63167}, "categories": [["CDs & Vinyl", "Children's Music", "Disney"], ["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.94, "brand": "Disney", "asin": "0788806270", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DVF3SBVRL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Bambi (Walt Disney's Masterpiece) [VHS]"}

Michael Keaton strikes just the right mood as the brooding &quot;Dark Knight&quot; of Gotham City; Kim Basinger plays Gotham's intrepid reporter Vicki Vale; and Jack Nicholson goes wild as the maniacal and scene-stealing Joker, who plots a takeover of the city with his lethal Smilex gas. Triumphant Oscar-winning production design by the late Anton Furst turnsBatmaninto a visual feast, and Burton brilliantly establishes a darkly mythic approach to Batman's legacy.

{"description": "Director William Friedkin was a hot ticket in Hollywood after the success ofThe French Connection, and he turned heads (in more ways than one) when he decided to makeThe Exorcistas his follow-up film. Adapted by William Peter Blatty from hiscontroversial bestseller, this shocking 1973 thriller set an intense and often-copied milestone for screen terror with its unflinching depiction of a young girl (Linda Blair) who is possessed by an evil spirit. Jason Miller and Max von Sydow are perfectly cast as the priests who risk their sanity and their lives to administer the rites of demonic exorcism, and Ellen Burstyn plays Blair's mother, who can only stand by in horror as her daughter's body is wracked by satanic disfiguration. One of the most frightening films ever made,The Exorcistwas mysteriously plagued by troubles during production, and the years have not diminished its capacity to disturb even the most stoical viewers. The film is presented in letterbox format on digital video disc, with a soundtrack that's guaranteed to curdle your blood.

{"description": "From its cleverly choreographed opening sequence to its heart-stopping climax on a rampant carousel, this 1951 Hitchcock classic readily earns its reputation as one of the director's finest examples of timeless cinematic suspense. It's not just a ripping-good thriller but a film student's delight and a perversely enjoyable battle of wits between tennis pro Guy (Farley Granger) and his mysterious, sycophantic admirer, Bruno (Robert Walker), who proposes a &quot;criss-cross&quot; scheme of traded murders. Bruno agrees to kill Guy's unfaithful wife, in return for which Guy will (or so it seems) kill Bruno's spiteful father. With an emphasis on narrative and visual strategy, Hitchcock controls the escalating tension with a master's flair for cinematic design, and the plot (coscripted by Raymond Chandler) is so tightly constructed that you'll be white-knuckled even after multiple viewings.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0002HOEQ2", "B000CCW2SY", "B000ECX0O2", "B0045HCJ9E", "B00871C09S", "B0087ZG7R0", "B001D8W7EK", "B00000CQJZ", "B000A9QK7I", "B00AEBB97S", "B000CCW2TS", "B001D8W7F4", "B000ECX0Q0", "B0002HOEQM", "B001D8W7EU", "B0087ZG7OI", "B00000C0QO", "B002GSXKQA", "B000CCW2U2", "B0002HOER6", "B0087ZG7PW", "B000ECX0S8", "6305999872", "B00AEBB89C", "B003ZEQMH8", "B0002HOEQW", "B00004XPPK", "B000A1INJE", "B00008LDNZ", "B0002HOEQC", "B000CCW2UW", "B000FFJYA2", "B009RWRINE", "B000CCW2UC", "B0002HOEPS", "B0050FXDDQ", "B002VWNIAY", "B005EVY8MQ", "B0006HBV3C", "B0010YSD7W", "B00K6D1QV8", "B000025RE7", "B005H8G78O", "B000MGBSDK", "B007Y1NR1W", "B000PMFRVU", "B00005LC4D", "B0009ML1Z2", "B00065GX64", "B0045HCJQW", "B00AEBBA7W", "B00003CXBZ", "B000244F2S", "B0000549B1", "B00AQ6J5YA", "B008BFSMBA", "B000ECX0QU", "B000FFJYAW", "B004NWPY3E", "B00006RCO1", "B00005AUK9", "B0045HCJ8U", "B00AEFYO5I", "B0008ENIAC", "B00005JKF6", "B000CNE088", "B00DZP1C9K", "B00005RDRL", "B000UVV25Q", "B002945DUM", "B0045HCJHG", "B00AEFXD1O", "B0002ERWZ0", "078323502X", "B000KGGJ1I", "B00003CXBU", "B006TTC5WC", "B000KIX8VK", "B00000JNVC", "B00004W229", "B004CZRE44", "B00AEBB8OC", "B00AMEZDK6", "B000FFJYAC", "B006FE83UE", "B0007US7EY", "B0010AN7Z4", "B000CNE08I", "B0014Z4OMU", "B00553K8DQ", "B000B8380A", "B000244EYW", "B0009S4IKQ", "B00074DY0M", "B00004TJKI", "B005152C9G"], "bought_together": ["B0002HOEQ2", "B0045HCJ9E"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00871C09S", "B0002HOEQ2", "B000CCW2SY", "B0045HCJ9E"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 124487}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.89, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "0790731029", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51J4BhbK2UL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Strangers on a Train"}
{"description": "When Ridley Scott's cut ofBlade Runnerwas finally released in 1993, one had to wonder why the studio hadn't done it right the first time--11 years earlier. This version is so much better, mostly because of what's been eliminated (the ludicrous and redundant voice-over narration and the phony happy ending) rather than what's been added (a bit more character development and a brief unicorn dream). Star Harrison Ford originally recorded the narration under duress at the insistence of Warner Bros. executives who thought the story needed further \"explanation\"; he later confessed that he thought if he did it badly they wouldn't use it. (Moral: Never overestimate the taste of movie executives.) The movie's spectacular futuristic vision of Los Angeles--a perpetually dark and rainy metropolis that's the nightmare antithesis of \"Sunny Southern California\"--is still its most seductive feature, an otherworldly atmosphere in which you can immerse yourself. The movie's shadowy visual style, along with its classic private-detective/murder-mystery plot line (with Ford on the trail of a murderous android, or \"replicant\"), makesBlade Runnerone of the few science fiction pictures to legitimately claim a place in the film noir tradition. And, as in the best noir, the sleuth discovers a whole lot more (about himself and the people he encounters) than he anticipates....

{"description": "After his successful direction of the Broadway hitsBarefoot in the ParkandThe Odd Couple,Mike Nichols made his filmmaking debut with this outstanding and still-powerful screen adaptation (by Ernest Lehman) of Edward Albee's taboo-shattering play. In their fourth film together (and by far their finest), Richard Burton and Oscar winner Elizabeth Taylor play a New England couple whose marriage hangs by a thin thread of self-deception, vicious verbal jousting, and embittered mutual need. George Segal and Sandy Dennis (who also won an Oscar) play the younger, unsuspecting couple who awkwardly witness the devastating rivalry of their hosts. Handling adult themes with intelligence and forceful dramatic impact, this was the film that finally shattered Hollywood's self-censoring Production Code with commercially successful results.

{"description": "Winner of four Academy Awards, including best picture, director, supporting actor, and best editing, Clint Eastwood's 1992 masterpiece stands as one of the greatest and most thematically compelling Westerns ever made. &quot;The movie summarized everything I feel about the Western,&quot; said Eastwood at the time of the film's release. &quot;The moral is the concern with gunplay.&quot; To illustrate that theme, Eastwood stars as a retired, once-ruthless killer-turned-gentle-widower and hog farmer. He accepts one last bounty-hunter mission--to find the men who brutalized a prostitute--to help support his two motherless children. Joined by his former partner (Morgan Freeman) and a cocky greenhorn (Jaimz Woolvett), he takes on a corrupt sheriff (Oscar winner Gene Hackman) in a showdown that makes the viewer feel the full impact of violence and its corruption of the soul.

{"description": "There were two movies about murder and the U.S. presidency released in 1997, and when you compare it toAbsolute Power, this one is clearly the lesser of the two. That doesn't mean it's a bad movie, but it does make it a mildly disappointing one, and it illustrates the hazards of crafting a film to fit the persona of its leading man. In this case, you've got Wesley Snipes, a young, savvy man of action, playing a Washington, D.C., police detective assigned to investigate the murder of a woman in the White House. The president's son is a prime suspect, but there's a cover-up underway that forces Snipes to intensify his investigation beyond normal parameters. For a while at least, this makesMurder at 1600a sharp and interesting film, and while the national security advisor (Alan Alda) seems highly cooperative (but don't be so sure), Snipes meets a secret service member (Diane Lane) who shares his belief in a high-level conspiracy. Unfortunately, that's when the film takes a downward plunge, resorting to a series of thriller clich&eacute;s including an unlikely chase through secret tunnels beneath the White House. We're not suggesting this couldn't happen, but it's the kind of thing you typically see in movies that have run out of original ideas before they're over.

Unfortunately, Jones and the entire cast have been trapped in a rambling plot, and the underdog status that made Ford such a compelling hero is sacrificed to an evenly matched and eventually tiresome game of cat and mouse, with a villain whose identity is far too predictable. With no dramatic buildup and several superfluous characters to distract its focus, the film's momentum plays out like a rote exercise compared to the high stakes of the earlier film.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303020089", "079212569X", "6304259158", "0783202253", "B00007CVYA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 443396}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.05, "brand": "", "asin": "0790736403", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51JRJ8M8FWL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Us Marshals [VHS]"}

{"description": "The last film completed by Bruce Lee before his untimely death,Enter the Dragonwas his entr&eacute;e into Hollywood. The American-Hong Kong coproduction, shot in Asia by American director Robert Clouse, stars Lee as a British agent sent to infiltrate the criminal empire of bloodthirsty Asian crime lord Han (Shih Kien) through his annual international martial arts tournament. Lee spends his days taking on tournament combatants and nights breaking into the heavily guarded underground fortress, kicking the living tar out of anyone who stands in his way. The mix of kung fu fighting (choreographed by Lee himself) and James Bond intrigue (the plot has more than a passing resemblance toDr. No) is pulpy by any standard, but the generous budget and talented cast of world-class martial artists puts this film in a category well above Lee's earlier Hong Kong productions. Unfortunately he's off the screen for large chunks of time as American maverick competitors (and champion martial artists) John Saxon and Jim Kelly take center stage, but once the fighting starts Lee takes over. The tournament setting provides an ample display of martial arts mastery of many styles and climaxes with a huge free-for-all, but the highlight is Lee's brutal one-on-one with the claw-fisted Han in the dynamic hall-of-mirrors battle. Lee narrows his eyes and tenses into a wiry force of sinew, speed, and ruthless determination.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300250164", "6301163796", "6300250172", "6305508534", "6300250156"], "bought_together": ["6300250164", "6300250172"], "also_viewed": ["6300250164", "6305519471", "6300250172"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 109259}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.95, "brand": "", "asin": "0790735172", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51X0KFFZYFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Enter the Dragon [VHS]"}

Jack Nicholson did it inThe Witches of Eastwick; Robert De Niro did it inAngel Heart(as Louis Cyphre--get it?). InThe Devil's AdvocateAl Pacino takes his turn as the great Satan, and clearly relishes his chance to raise hell. He's a New York lawyer, of course, by the name of John Milton, who recruits a hotshot young Florida attorney (Keanu Reeves) to his firm and seduces him with tempting offers of power, sex, and money. Think of the story as a twist on John Grisham'sThe Firm, with the corporate evil made even more explicit. Reeves is wooden, and therefore doesn't seem to have much of a soul to lose, but he's really just our excuse to meet the devil. Pacino's the main attraction, gleefully showing off his--and the Antichrist's--chops at perpetrating menace and mayhem.

Doris Day, as Babe, has never been so efficiently cute. Raitt starred in the Broadway version, as did much of the film's cast (Day replaced original stage star Janis Paige).The Pajama Gameis filled with recognizable, classic songs, done so well and danced so athletically that this musical can engage an action-film fan. Bob Fosse's trademark choreography shines.Check out two numbers danced by the late, underused, and underrated Carol Haney, who performs amazing feats for \"Steam Heat\" and \"Hernando's Hideaway.\" Both Day and Raitt deliver lovely renditions of \"Hey There.\" They're also supported by a great cast that includes, in addition to Haney, a slyly coy Reta Shaw and a dynamic Eddie Foy Jr.--N.F.

Morpheus awakens Neo to the real world, a ravaged wasteland where most of humanity have been captured by a race of machines that live off of the humans' body heat and electrochemical energy and who imprison their minds within an artificial reality known as the Matrix. As a rebel against the machines, Neo must return to the Matrix and confront the agents: super-powerful computer programs devoted to snuffing out Neo and the entire human rebellion.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JLTM", "B0001DI5W6", "0784011923", "B001FB55HQ", "0792845684", "B001DZFYPW", "0790731975", "6300271331", "B00003CXE6", "0792839846", "0792133153", "6303257844", "6303313345", "6300182304", "6303168507", "B00000JGEK", "6304071876", "6300215830", "6301963725", "0800199421", "6303398480", "6305363668", "6303202004", "079213690X", "6304258984", "B0000509BZ", "6304434170", "630018627X", "6301976622", "0783222955", "6302610702", "6302787564", "0800132009", "0767825411", "6303020089", "6301574117", "6302909023", "B000003KHS"], "bought_together": ["B00005JLTM", "B0001DI5W6"], "also_viewed": ["B001DJLD1M", "B0054509I4", "B001CEE1YE", "B00005JKCH", "6303148352", "B000AYELVA", "B001GZ6QEC", "B001JNNDBA", "B0000AXE8I", "B0001DI5W6", "6303215734", "B00005JLTM", "B0007WFX62", "6304143184", "B00005N5S5", "B001AQT0Z4", "B001FB55HQ", "B0013FBS20", "B0001BKAEY", "B000PC6A3E", "B00007ELF1", "B00005JMQW", "B0000633U4", "1880521008", "B004XKVPG6", "B00ANGID14", "B001RIY4WE", "B008M4MB8K", "B00AEFY5B6", "B00B4804KS", "B00E5I2MCM", "B005LAIHY0", "B0013FSL3E", "B00471JSRE", "B0057R5XRG", "B00E9PMMX0", "B00C3MKCF6", "B00BEZTMFY", "B00AQNOCZ0", "B00IWULSTC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 579943}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.97, "brand": "", "asin": "0790745399", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51208Z0A3HL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Matrix"}

{"description": "When the theatrical release of James Cameron'sTitanicwas delayed from July to December of 1997, media pundits speculated that Cameron's $200&nbsp;million disaster epic would cause the director's downfall, signal the end of the blockbuster era, and sink Paramount Studios as quickly as the ill-fated luxury liner had sunk on that fateful night of April&nbsp;14, 1912. Some studio executives were confident, others horrified, but the clarity of hindsight turned Cameron into an Oscar-winning genius, a shrewd businessman, and one of the most successful directors in the history of motion pictures.Titanicwould surpass the $1&nbsp;billion mark in global box-office receipts (largely due to multiple viewings, the majority by teenage girls), win 11&nbsp;Academy Awards including best picture and director, produce the best-selling movie soundtrack of all time, and make a global superstar of Leonardo DiCaprio. A bona fide pop-cultural phenomenon, the film has all the ingredients of a blockbuster (romance, passion, luxury, grand scale, a snidely villain, and an epic, life-threatening crisis), but Cameron's alchemy of these ingredients proved more popular than anyone could have predicted. His stroke of genius was to combine absolute authenticity with a pair of fictional lovers whose tragic fate would draw viewers into the heart-wrenching reality of theTitanicdisaster. As starving artist Jack Dawson and soon-to-be-married socialite Rose DeWitt Bukater, DiCaprio and Kate Winslet won the hearts of viewers around the world, and their brief but never-forgotten love affair provides the humanity that Cameron needed to turnTitanicinto an emotional experience. Present-day framing scenes (featuring Gloria Stuart as the 101-year-old Rose) add additional resonance to the story, and although some viewers proved vehemently immune to Cameron's manipulations, few can deny the production's impressive achievements. Although some of the computer-generated visual effects look artificial, others--such as the sunset silhouette ofTitanicduring its first evening at sea, or the climactic splitting of the ship's sinking hull--are state-of-the-art marvels. In terms of sets and costumes alone, the film is never less than astounding. More than anything else, however, the film's overwhelming popularity speaks for itself.Titanicis an event film and a monument to Cameron's risk-taking audacity, blending the tragic irony of theTitanicdisaster with just enough narrative invention to give the historical event its fullest and most timeless dramatic impact.Titanicis an epic love story on par withGone with the Wind, and like that earlier box-office phenomenon, it's a film for the ages.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305123616", "6304117752", "6301792734", "6303215734", "B00000JS61", "6304178352", "6303396623", "6303314015", "B00003CXTF", "0769403468", "6301734734", "6302936381", "6303300480", "6305368139", "B00005RRG3", "6302610702", "0792839846", "6300207919", "B000P0J0C4", "6304546262", "B000056BRF", "6304400551", "6303101267", "630150528X", "6303637574", "B000P0J0EW", "6305126062", "6302935148", "0800199421", "6304681496", "0792116887", "6301963911", "B0000DCGT1", "B00001IVED", "6305169187", "B00006RCST", "6300216721", "630197879X", "0800113055", "076780922X", "080010367X", "0800141326", "0800184319", "6304039522", "B000066AXC"], "bought_together": ["6305123616"], "also_viewed": ["B009VQHDSQ", "6303314015", "B0074JODXU", "B00003CXTF", "B003JQZXWW", "6302787068", "6301796535", "0788812807", "0788806270", "B00005JKDQ", "6304500831", "6305229449", "6304117752", "6300213668", "6304089767", "B0000AQZYM", "079213690X", "6303049079", "6305123616", "6303402348", "6301792734", "0788812408", "B00079HZSE", "B000035Z2S", "B00000K3AN", "0788805843", "6302526574", "B0000029YC", "6303534422", "6303215734", "B0070285YE", "B00008LDO9", "0783216084", "6304434340", "B00BBND56G", "0788805533", "6300183211", "6302320402", "6305750750", "B0002CHI3S", "0790748266", "6304143184", "B0000040CM", "B005X7H9SQ", "B00004RFHF", "B00005V1Z7", "6302814782", "6301572688", "B00000JS61", "B008SLUWZG", "6303257844", "B00078XGO2", "0790736039", "B0000040EJ", "B000065U6Q", "B00003CX7L", "B00000ADKZ", "6300263673", "6302178924"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 65950}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.47, "brand": "Paramount", "asin": "0792151712", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21BAWEVBJ1L.jpg", "title": "Titanic [VHS]"}

{"description": "Although it lacks the creepy subtleties of Stephen King's celebrated  novel, George Romero's underrated adaptation ofThe Dark Halfranks among  the best films based on King's fiction, with Romero taking care to honor King's  central theme while serving up some gruesome gore in the film's much-criticized  finale. Inspired by King's own admission that he wrote several novels under the  pseudonym Richard Bachman,The Dark Halfexplores the duality of a  writer's impulse, ranging from literary respectability to the viscerally  cathartic thrills of exploitative pulp fiction.Author and teacher Thad Beaumont (Timothy Hutton) finds himself torn between  those extremes when he \"kills\" his profitable, pseudonymous alter ego George  Stark (the bestselling \"dark half\" to Thad's light), who then assumes an evil,  autonomous form (again played by Hutton) to lethally defend his role in Thad's  creative endeavors. Forced to wrestle with this evil manifestation of his own  unformed twin, Thad must fight to protect his wife (Amy Madigan), their twin  babies, and his own survival as an artist. Romero skillfully develops the  twin/duality theme to explore the writer's dilemma, and Hutton is outstanding in  his dual roles, playing Stark (in subtly fiendish makeup) as a redneck rebel  with a knack for slashing throats. Julie Harris adds class in a supporting role,  and horror fans will relish Romero's climactic showdown, in which swarms of  sparrows seal Stark's fate. It favors a pulp sensibility with clunky exposition  to explain Stark's existence, butThe Dark Halfis a laudable effort from  everyone involved.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000068IES", "B000G1R39E", "B006J8NPAE", "B00005UQ9V", "6305645574", "B0001FVDQ4", "B00AEBB91O", "0767821599", "B000053UIF", "B000GYI340", "B0007WFXNA", "6305120021", "B00000F3SB", "B00AEBB91E", "B00005O439", "B00AEFXR8I", "B00006FDCU", "B0000C2IQQ", "630523650X", "B0002OXVG4", "B000U1ZV6W", "B00BW4S87U", "0792846443", "B00A1AU72A", "B0010X73ZG", "1573625779", "B00BTYPW7C", "B0007NFMB2", "B0002A2VK0", "B0053TWVDC", "B000063US5", "B0002O7XW2", "B00005LQ0Q", "B00BW4S8AC", "B0053TWV46", "B00AEFYV9W", "B00AKGG828", "B000GBEWRU", "B00BW4S89S", "B00030AZCK", "B00005K3NR", "0790742829", "B002NZK5SM", "B00KW3A6KE", "B00LBFFR2Y", "B0033HKCV4", "B000TJ6PBK", "B00006FDCD", "B008QE9Z8A", "B0084MVE7E", "1573626910", "6304604572", "B002GHHHG0", "B003L2M584", "B0002234LS", "6304936397", "B000069I05", "B000077VRT", "B000RZIGUE", "B00JJOY45U", "B00IYJRIKO", "B00APQLJTA", "B000N2HD6Y", "B002KH4KSY", "B00003CXIP", "B002VWNIDG", "B00JJOY496", "B000P0J0EM", "1573623911", "B0052XU4BK", "078062856X", "B00009QG7O", "B00JJOY47I", "B00DII0MGI", "B00K1L4NBU", "B002AMVEII", "B000085EER", "B000UVKHNY", "B00005NQGM", "B00HRUQ7WG", "B005CFBZVG", "0792841336", "B0029EW7BA", "B004FUPK6U", "B00HRUQ8X4", "B0002S94BQ", "B00KDU8HQQ", "0792842960", "B00A1AU702", "B00302QF72", "B00005N5RM", "B00DOZNGTK", "B0084MVDUM", "B002WDR4AC", "B00HRUQB8Q", "B00GJ7CUFG", "B00D97DMBU", "B00003L9CQ"], "bought_together": ["B000068IES"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00009OWI3", "B006J8NPAE", "B00000F3SB", "B00BW4S8AC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 34095}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 13.96, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "0792841328", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/517RCFE3MHL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Dark Half"}

Leaving Tracy, bedding Mary and quitting his job are just the beginning of Isaac's quest for romance and fulfillment in a city where sex is as intimate as a handshakeandthe gateway to true love is a revolving door.  *Supporting Actress (Hemingway); Original Screenplay", "related": {"also_bought": ["6304907729", "B00005O06J", "B00005AUJK", "B00AEFYVUQ", "0767819764", "0792846117", "B000062XE6", "B00005O06N", "0792846125", "B00008978N", "6305291470", "B005MYEQ4U", "B00005O06M", "6305327068", "0792846060", "B000IU37SO", "B001DJ7PR8", "B000EQHXNW", "B00005O06L", "B003UESJCY", "0792846087", "B00005O06I", "B00A1O0G3G", "0792846095", "0792846079", "6305428085", "B0064NTZKI", "B002LMV7RA", "B00005O06K", "B00020X88E", "B00013D580", "B000AM6P2U", "B00G7QPXUI", "B00079Z9VO", "B00005AUJH", "B00005AUJI", "B00005JMON", "B00005JL81", "B00003CXGS", "B00003CY6A", "B0013D8LC2", "B00008L3UM", "0792833287", "B0006GAOJA", "B00005AUJO", "B000XJD33O", "B0007ZEOPK", "B00005QAPH", "B00005O06O", "B000CNESU8", "B00002E22E", "B000WC39ZY", "B00004STRD", "B000TXNDV6", "0767830555", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B000056KMW", "0780622243", "B00008L3SA", "B00006RCNV", "B0000640VJ", "B00GHJ1YUI", "B005KQVE1S", "B000286RP2", "B0050FXDDQ", "B000CS45TW", "B00AEFXN9G", "0780618564", "6305882592", "B003O7I6SE", "B00005AUKD", "B0007XBKP4", "B000305ZYS", "B00006CXGZ", "B00AEFXG2U", "B001B1UO7G", "B000CNESTE", "B000063K2Q", "B000025RE7", "B00008RH3J", "B00000JGOI", "B00005JMJG", "B00005AUJM", "B000CEXEWA", "6305918880", "B001BEK8E2", "B00005MEOU", "B00B27WTOK", "B00441GYOM", "B000GG4Y32", "B000068MBW", "B0045HCJQW", "B002VWNIAY", "B00GMV8L1Q", "B000065V38", "B004NWPY20", "B00005NC66", "B000KX0IOA", "B001CW7ZT4"], "bought_together": ["6304907729", "B00005O06J"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00BN3DZZA", "6304907729", "0767819764", "B00005AUJK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 17530}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.38, "brand": "Manhattan", "asin": "0792846109", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51vEMCaXeXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Manhattan"}

It's not a botch, just a movie that hammers its efforts at humor too hard. The focus is split between three story lines: the life of cereal tycoon John Kellogg (Anthony Hopkins with buck teeth), who has created a health spa for the wealthy that focuses on regular cleansing of the digestive tract (as well as applications of electricity); the troubles of an unhappy young couple (Matthew Broderick and Bridget Fonda), who come to the spa hoping to cure their marital ills (Broderick gets the worst of the deal); and the efforts of a young hustler (John Cusack), who is trying to break into the breakfast-cereal business but gets taken by an even bigger hustler (Michael Lerner). There are subplots about Kellogg's children but they add little.

{"description": "Thirteen-year-old Jenna (Shana Dowdeswell) has had enough with the trials of adolescence. In addition to being saddled with a devoted-but-nerdy best friend, Matt (Sean Marquette), she falls victim to one of the dangers of playing Seven Minutes in Heaven with the coolest kids in school: being stranded without a willing make-out partner. Humiliated, Jenna buries herself in the aforementioned make-out closet, wishing she could skip the whole adolescence bit and move straight into adulthood, and miraculously wakes up just weeks away from her 30th birthday. Of course, a lot has changed since going to bed the night before, not the least of which being an impressive set of womanly curves. The new, older Jenna (Jennifer Garner) is a successful magazine editor with friends in high places and a lion's share of potential suitors -- including a hockey-playing boyfriend and a swarthy married man. The problem is that her mind hasn't matured with her body; Jenna not only finds living on her own more terrifying than cool, but is quick to dismiss any male over the age of 14 as \"gross.\" Half excited, half mortified, Jenna seeks out Matt (Mark Ruffalo), whom she learns she had spurned as a teenager in an effort to join the popular crowd.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00006ZXSL", "B00AKGG6JS", "B00005O5CM", "B00AEFXO8Q", "B0015I2RT8", "B001OQCUYI", "B00005JMCW", "B001OQCUZM", "B00003CXSM", "B000J103OI", "B00AEFYM2S", "B002K0WBXW", "B00AEBB8R4", "B000EMGICS", "B004SIP9X8", "B003LSFM6U", "B0000897EG", "B000ELJAEM", "B00AEFY99O", "1401324142", "6304765266", "1416205152", "B00GO37I8Y", "0809229374", "B0001XAR1I", "B0001Z3TXE", "B00005JM55", "B00AEFYWQY", "B00007E2F5", "B0002VYOVI", "B00KS9V6EC", "B000J4QW7W", "B000YDBPAM", "B0007PLLBU", "B001TUZD8O", "B002ZG988M", "B0009OL7Z4", "B004SIP9RO", "B0000ZMGWK", "1400050138", "B0000DZ6N3", "B00AQS803A", "6302077818", "B00006ZXSK", "B00005JN0Z", "B000YAA68C", "B0007LXPBI", "B00E4Z7FQY", "B002P413IC", "B001ASQ9OM", "B006YTGL86", "B00795C5X4", "B00063KGPU", "B000BVM1S2", "B000209KMW", "B000A343RI", "B00062IVN0", "B000P0J0DS", "B00002SSKI", "6305428425", "B003TY2SWC", "B0051GLDVS", "B00008K7AM", "B0071HPOGK", "B0000AKCJK", "B000023VTP", "B00AEBB8YW", "B00006FMUW", "B002XTXG8O", "B00AMEZDJW", "B001AEF6BS", "B00447L4KA", "B000MQC9H4", "6305428042", "B002GOAH1U", "B0036TGSIK", "B002A5EBMQ", "B0000AOV4I", "B001C5LLQ4", "B000324Y98", "B00005JG6N", "6305236569", "B00AEFZ6V4", "B004EPZ070", "B003L20ICE", "B0038N9X3Q", "B00AEBBA2M", "B00005JN3W", "B0075RREYG", "B000F2BNW2", "0783235070", "B0021L8UO4", "0800177258", "B002SYAGNC", "B000HT386M", "B0007P0Y7C", "B000QUU4LY", "B00006ZXSN", "B00AEBB9WI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0013D8LFY", "B002K0WBXW", "B00AKGG6JS", "B001OQCUZM"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 461629}, "asin": "1404918051", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41EO6%2BQ3jvL.jpg", "title": "13 Going on 30: Fun &amp; Flirty Edition"}

{"description": "From a match made in heaven comes a movie spawned in hell! Young hotshot director Robert Rodriquez (El Mariachi,Desperado) teamed up withPulp Fictionauteur Quentin Tarantino (offering his services as writer and co-star) to make this outrageous, no-holds-barred hybrid of high-octane crime and gruesome horror. QT plays Richard Gecko, a borderline psychopath who breaks his career-criminal brother, Seth (George Clooney), out of prison, after which they rob a bank and leave a trail of dead and wounded in their bloody wake. Then they hijack a mobile home driven by a former Baptist minister (Harvey Keitel) who quit the church after his wife's death and hit the road with his two children (played by Juliette Lewis and Ernest Liu). Heading to Mexico with their hostages, the infamous Gecko brothers arrive at the Titty Twister bar to rendezvous for a money drop, but they don't realize that they've just entered the nocturnal lair of a bloodthirsty gang of vampires! With not-so-subtle aplomb, Rodriguez and Tarantino shift into high gear with a nonstop parade of gore, gunfire, and pointy-fanged mayhem featuring Salma Hayek as a snake-charming dancer whose bite is much worse than her bark. If you're a fan of Tarantino's lyrical dialogue and pop-cultural wit, you'll have fun with the road-movie half of this supernatural horror-comedy, but if your taste runs more to exploding heads and eyeballs, sloppy entrails and morphing monsters, the second half provides a connoisseur's feast of gross-out excess.Bon app&eacute;tit!--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002AF4Y9G", "B000UAE7O0", "B000R7HY0K", "B004U7MR14", "B000P0J0D8", "6305327041", "B0000A2ZU1", "B004SIP9Z6", "B004SIP95G", "B002T9H2LA", "B00008975Z", "B007D5E7C2", "B002ZG98C8", "B0000WN140", "B007D0FVRM", "B005LAIIJY", "6305428468", "B00005JMUA", "B0045DO81U", "B00005JMEW", "630569270X", "B0009A40ES", "B001VLBDD0", "B0000A2ZTY", "B003Y8YB3C", "B0031P77RU", "B00027JZ3E", "B00070FX5U", "B000ASDFI6", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00004Y87O", "B000A2UBN4", "B000OVLBHG", "B00005O5AY", "B00011CZRE", "B000K7VHNW", "B000093FLA", "B0024FADD8", "6305258287", "B000WC3864", "B003HKN52U", "B001CDFY50", "B000AXWHSA", "B00111YM5Q", "B000EHRVP6", "B002VWNIDG", "B000P0J09M", "0767811054", "B004P7CN7W", "B00005QJHP", "B00AEFYYWQ", "0767802519", "B00GDDNFDW", "0783229526", "B008CYDD7I", "B008LC8V1Y", "B0007DFJ0G", "B001KRVLCI", "B00005JKWJ", "B000RTB0R6", "0783229402", "B00AEFYUQQ", "B00003CXWV", "B00005JLRE", "B002U4UZSQ", "B000LP6KNU", "B00AKGG828", "B002WY65VU", "B005J9ZFQG", "6305594333", "B0007KZQAM", "B000C20VRS", "B000056PMU", "6304765258", "B00005N5S5", "B00006CXGP", "B003PIUINS", "6305065551", "B00005JA8B", "B0002ABURA", "B00001QGUM", "B003AWRMCE", "0800177789", "B000022TSY", "B003TRMLQM", "B00008RH3J", "B00AEFXESQ", "B0002KVULG", "B002GSXKNI", "B002JT69IW", "B0085A9HU6", "0780618548", "B000055Y0Y", "B004P7CMOQ", "B006CXIKYC", "0792846435", "B00AEBBADG", "B00AEFY5B6", "0767817664", "B00005V9HH"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004P7CMOQ", "B000UAE7O0", "B004SIP95G", "B004SIP9Z6"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 216353}, "asin": "1558908455", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/517ESWW8VSL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "From Dusk Till Dawn"}

{"description": "In the 1960s and early '70s, Claude Chabrol was celebrated as the Gallic Hitchcock for his crisp, character-rich thrillers.La  C&eacute;r&eacute;monie, his 1997 hit adapted from Ruth Rendell's novelA Judgement in Stone, is a return to form, an assured domestic drama set in the upper-class household of the kind but condescending Lelievres family. Sandrine Bonnaire, excellent in an enigmatic, uncommunicative role, stars as their new, neurotically silent maid Sophie. She performs her duties efficiently and emotionlessly, staring out from behind an implacable, mask-like face born of loneliness and defensiveness. Isabelle Huppert is the town's gleefully misanthropic postmistress Jeanne, a gossipy, energetically insolent misfit who hates the Lelievres. When she becomes Sophie's best friend, her pathological game of taunts and gossip goes into overdrive with her sudden access to their house, and an already simmering class conflict boils over in unleashed anger. Chabrol charts the cascade of mischief and misunderstandings to its shattering conclusion, with a sensitivity to character and an eagle-eyed remove that makes the explosive climax all the more chilling. It's a devastating thriller, one of Chabrol's best, and a powerful portrait in hate and psychosis pushed over the edge in misunderstanding, manipulation, and mistrust. Jacqueline Bisset is the fumbling but sincere Mme.

{"description": "Costa-Gavras'sZ, winner of the 1970 Academy Award for Best Foreign Film, is a classic political thriller, combining intrigue with raw emotional power. The story turns on the investigation of the assassination of a left-wing Greek politician (Yves Montand), and his government's attempts to cover up the murky circumstances. Montand receives death threats as he prepares to give a speech condemning the government, and is then run down in front of numerous witnesses. Jean-Louis Trintignant (The Conformist) plays the judge assigned to the investigation, who gradually discovers how far the state will go to rid itself of political opposition. As he is warned off the case by his superiors, the judge becomes even more determined to discover the truth, no matter where it might lead. Costa-Gavras (Missing,Mad City) is in familiar territory here, but no one handles this type of material better.Zis a classic of political intrigue and social consciousness.--Robert Lane", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 399575}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.76, "brand": "", "asin": "1572521163", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51R1GYXF6FL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Z [VHS]"}
{"description": "One of the most ferociously iconoclastic and experimental films of the French New Wave, Alain Resnais's 1961 feature, winner of the grand prize at that year's Venice Film Festival, is based on a script by Alain Robbe-Grillet. At its center is what seems to be a simple but unanswerable puzzle: Did its protagonist (Giorgio Albertazzi) have an affair the year before with a woman (Delphine Seyrig) he just met (or possibly re-met) at his hotel? The inquiry becomes an unsettling experiment in flattening the dimensions of past, present, and future so that any difference between them becomes meaningless, while Resnais's coldly formal but oddly dreamlike geometric compositions make space itself seem a function of subjective memory. Add to that Resnais's trademark tracking shots--long, smooth, a visual correlative of a wordless feeling--and this is a film that truly gets under the skin in almost inexplicable ways.

{"description": "A darling of the 1998 festival circuit, Marc Levin'sSlamwon the Grand Jury Prize at Sundance as well as the Camera d'Or (best first film) at Cannes. Despite its shortcomings, the film merits these awards--Slamoffers a strong cast and compelling subject matter, a perfect setting with a killersoundtrack, and over-the-top rap poetry.The film opens with an exterior shot of the protagonist, Raymond Joshua (played by real-life poet Saul Williams), walking away from the Capitol Building in Washington, D.C. The image of a young black man turning his back on this symbol of government scant minutes before he's popped on a chump-change drug charge is poignant and disturbing--not easily forgotten by anyone aware of the immense contradictions inherent in the demographics of the nation's capital.Slamdepicts Raymond's fall from relative innocence, and his apparent redemption. As a small-time dope dealer and street poet, his arrest thrusts him into an unfamiliar world--the violence of life in the slammer is palpable and altogether frightening. Incarceration, however, awakens the slumbering power of Raymond's poetry; eventually, its strength keeps him alive. In a prison yard scene when he's about to get whomped, Raymond gives free rein to his words, choosing poetry in motion over violence. Hearing Raymond's impassioned words, the hardened cons let him walk. One of them even covers his bail, and Raymond hits the streets, eager to check out Lauren (Sonja Sohn), the creative-writing teacher he met behind bars.Although the third act dilutes the credibility established by Levin's in-your-face v&eacute;rit&eacute; style,Slamis relentlessly passionate, unswerving in its conviction that there's an alternative to the violence that decimates North America's inner cities. Indeed, for all the film's preachiness, we cheer Raymond on, fueling his poetry, hoping, somehow, that it can transform those around him.

{"description": "When Universal Pictures picked up the movie rights to a Broadway adaptation ofDracula, they felt secure in handing the property over to the sinister team of actor Lon Chaney and director Tod Browning. But Chaney died of cancer, and Universal hired the Hungarian who had scored a success in the stage play: B&eacute;la Lugosi. The resulting film launched both Lugosi's baroque career and the horror-movie cycle of the 1930s. It gets off to an atmospheric start, as we meet Count Dracula in his shadowy castle in Transylvania, superbly captured by the great cinematographer Karl Freund. Eventually Dracula and his blood-sucking devotee (Dwight Frye, in one of the cinema's truly mad performances) meet their match in a vampire-hunter called Van Helsing (Edward Van Sloan). If the later sections of the film are undeniably stage bound and a tad creaky, Dracula nevertheless casts a spell, thanks to Lugosi's creepily lugubrious manner and the eerie silences of Browning's directing style. (After a mood-enhancing snippet ofSwan Lakeunder the opening titles, there is no music in the film.)Frankenstein, which was released a few months later, confirmed the horror craze, and Universal has been making money (and countless spin-off projects) from its twin titans of terror ever since.

{"description": "You didn't think Mr. Spock wasreallydead, did you? When Spock's casket landed on the surface of the Genesis planet at the end ofStar Trek II, we had already been told that Genesis had the power to bring \"life from lifelessness.\" So it's no surprise that this energetic but somewhat hokey sequel gives Spock a new lease on life, beginning with his rebirth and rapid growth as the Genesis planet literally shakes itself apart in a series of tumultuous geological spasms. As Kirk is getting to know his estranged son (Merritt Butrick), he must also do battle with the fiendish Klingon Kruge (Christopher Lloyd), who is determined to seize the power of Genesis from the Federation. Meanwhile, the regenerated Spock returns to his home planet, andStar Trek IIIgains considerable interest by exploring the ceremonial (and, of course, highly logical) traditions of Vulcan society. The movie's a minor disappointment compared toStar Trek II, but it's a--well, logical--sequel that successfully restores Spock (and first-time film director Leonard Nimoy) to the phenomenalTrekfranchise...as if he were ever really gone. With Kirk's willful destruction of the U.S.S.Enterpriseand Robin Curtis replacing the departing Kirstie Alley as Vulcan Lt. Saavik, this was clearly a transitional film in the series, clearing the way for the highly popularStar Trek IV.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300213803", "6300216802", "6301543408", "6303202004", "630021463X", "6304415346", "B00008OSD3", "B00AZMFJYA", "6305587159", "6301792769", "B0000A36J1", "B0001VL30O", "6302120101"], "bought_together": ["6300213803", "6300216802"], "also_viewed": ["6300213803", "630021463X", "6300216802", "6303202004", "6301543408", "6304415346", "6304539258", "0800103106", "6303909949", "630339406X", "6300214435", "B00BAXTYIA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 306882}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.91, "brand": "", "asin": "6300214400", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515ZYD4PVBL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Star Trek III - The Search for Spock [VHS]"}
{"description": "This splatter flick, along with John Carpenter'sHalloween, helped spawn the great horror-movie movement of the '80s, not to mentioneightsequels, many of which had nothing to do with the films that preceded them. It also gave birth to Jason Voorhees, one of the three biggest horror-movie psychos of the modern era (the other two beingHalloween's Michael Myers andA Nightmare on Elm Street's Freddy Krueger). Forever duplicated, the originalFriday the 13thpopularized a number of themes and techniques that today are now clich&eacute;s: the increasingly gory murders, the remote forest location, the anonymous and nubile cast, the murderer as cult hero, and, of course, the moral that if you have sex, you will die, very painfully. Still, if you have to see aFriday the 13thmovie, this is the one to check out. A group of eager (and horny) teenagers decide to reopen Camp Crystal Lake, which 20 years earlier was closed after the shocking and mysterious murders of two amorous camp counselors. You can take it from there, as the teens get picked off one by one, during a dark and stormy night; of course, their car won't start and there's no phone. The ending stole shamelessly from Brian De Palma'sCarrie, but it still provides a slight if campy shock. Look for a young Kevin Bacon as the requisite stud--you can tell that's what he is because when the cast appears in swimsuits, he's wearing a Speedo--who's the beneficiary of the film's best murder sequence, an arrowhead to the throat.

Crosby and Kaye are song-and-dance men who hook up, romantically and professionally, with a \"sister\" act (Clooney and Vera-Ellen) to put on a Big Show to benefit the struggling ski-resort lodge run by the beloved old retired general (Dean Jagger) of their WWII Army outfit. Crosby is cool, Clooney is warm, Kaye is goofy, and Vera-Ellen is leggy.

{"description": "Black comedies don't come much blacker than this cult favorite from 1972, and they don't come much funnier, either. It seemed that director Hal Ashby was the perfect choice to mine a mother lode of eccentricity from the original script by Colin Higgins, about the unlikely romance between a death-obsessed 19-year-old named Harold (Bud Cort) and a life-loving 79-year-old widow named Maude (Ruth Gordon). They meet at a funeral, and Maude finds something oddly appealing about Harold, urging him to \"reach out\" and grab life by the lapels as opposed to dwelling morbidly on mortality. Harold grows fond of the old gal--she's a lot more fun than the girls his mother desperately matches him up with--and together they makeHarold & Maudeone of the sweetest and most unconventional love stories ever made. Much of the earlier humor arises from Harold's outrageous suicide fantasies, played out as a kind of twisted parlor game to mortify his mother, who's grown immune to her strange son's antics. Gradually, however, the film's clever humor shifts to a brighter outlook and finally arrives at a point where Harold is truly happy to be alive. Featuring soundtrack songs by Cat Stevens, this comedy certainly won't appeal to all tastes (it was a box-office flop when first released), but if you're on its quirky wavelength, it might just strike you as one of the funniest movies you've ever seen.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301590740", "B00000FZCU"], "bought_together": ["6301590740"], "also_viewed": ["6300247171"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 239875}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6300216268", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5184NCC63XL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Harold &amp; Maude [VHS]"}
{"description": "In the tradition of such obsessively driven directors as Erich von Stroheim and Werner Herzog, Francis Ford Coppola approached the production ofApocalypse Nowas if it were his own epic mission into the heart of darkness. On location in the storm-ravaged Philippines, he quite literally went mad as the project threatened to devour him in a vortex of creative despair, but from this insanity came one of the greatest films ever made. It began as a John Milius screenplay, transposing Joseph Conrad's classic story \"Heart of Darkness\" into the horrors of the Vietnam War, following a battle-weary Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) on a secret upriver mission to find and execute the renegade Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), who has reverted to a state of murderous and mystical insanity. The journey is fraught with danger involving wartime action on epic and intimate scales. One measure of the film's awesome visceral impact is the number of sequences, images, and lines of dialogue that have literally burned themselves into our cinematic consciousness, from the Wagnerian strike of helicopter gunships on a Vietnamese village to the brutal murder of stowaways on a peasant sampan and the unflinching fearlessness of the surfing warrior Lieutenant Colonel Kilgore (Robert Duvall), who speaks lovingly of \"the smell of napalm in the morning.\" Like Herzog'sAguirre: The Wrath of God, this film is the product of genius cast into a pit of hell and emerging, phoenix-like, in triumph. Coppola's obsession (effectively detailed in the riveting documentaryHearts of Darkness, directed by Coppola's wife, Eleanor) informs every scene and every frame, and the result is a film for the ages.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301115430", "630018627X", "0790701251", "6300183211", "6303686796", "6305363668", "079284646X", "6304935811", "0784011923", "6303953425", "0792836510", "6302822688", "B000003KHS", "630021639X", "6304119046", "B00003CXE6", "6302610702", "0792158261", "B000K7VHQE", "6303036570", "6303020089", "6303651488", "0800125762", "B004LWZW9W", "B00000JGEI", "0790705141", "6302360978", "6302415853", "0783107986", "B00005ATQA", "630336568X", "0790731975", "6305095566", "6300216500", "6301662954", "6302921058", "6300246965", "6300182878", "0800100832", "B00005JKEC", "6304286961", "B000062XM6", "0784011575", "630197154X", "B00004TYS8", "B00004WIDB", "6304414099", "0800116917", "6302517036", "0800199421", "6304259131", "0783202253", "6303109950", "6303313345", "B00006C7G9", "0792837312", "6302482712", "6300213986", "6303421563", "6304039549", "B000065U6Q", "B0000A36J1", "6300182770", "B00004CNR5", "6304025831", "6303422020", "0790748169", "0800132009"], "bought_together": ["6301115430", "0790701251"], "also_viewed": ["6303953425", "6305363668", "6305750750", "B00000J2KZ", "6303506291", "6303314015"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 172447}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.75, "brand": "", "asin": "6300214826", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41EFVS37MRL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Apocalypse Now [VHS]"}

{"description": "Writer-director Preston Sturges's third feature, 1941'sSullivan's Travels, remains the antic auteur's most ambitious screen effort. Having added the producer's stripe to his duties, Sturges combines breezy romantic comedy, arch Hollywood satire, and social essay into a single, screwball story line.The titular pilgrim is John L. Sullivan (Joel McCrea), an Ivy League grad who's enjoyed a meteoric rise as the director behind escapist movies likeAnts in Your Pants of 1938, but is now determined to raise his sights toward more exalted, serious-minded cinematic art. His proposed breakthrough, portentously titledO Brother, Where Art Thou?, elicits a studio response closer to \"Oh, brother,\" given the director's utter lack of first-hand experience on the wrong side of the tracks.Instead of capitulating, Sullivan sets off disguised as a tramp, ready to meet life's crueler lessons face-to-face--albeit followed at a discreet distance by a motor home filled with studio handlers and reporters. His ludicrous odyssey may give the boy director no real insight, but it gives Sturges the chance to inject some reliably fine gags and a romantic subplot featuring the luminous Veronica Lake. It's at this juncture that Sturges the writer's darker objective throws a jolting shift in tone. Suffice it to say that just when a comic, upbeat denouement seems imminent, Sullivan travels instead from the sunlit California of the comedy's early reels toward a darker, relentlessly downbeat world influenced more by the social realism of the movies the hero desperately wants to make. By the final reel, Sturges has flirted with real tragedy, turning his conclusion into a meditation on his own seemingly carefree, dizzily comic art.--Sam Sutherland", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0001ZMXAY", "1558802010", "6300270068", "6301586034", "6300185125", "630196585X"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 282671}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6301232291", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41QKDMDZGKL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Sullivan's Travels [VHS]"}

Before she knows what's happening, the men she's been flirting with have pinned her down for a gang rape. The story centers on the efforts of a district attorney (Kelly McGillis) to press her case, in spite of a wall of silence by the participants--and then to take the unusual step of going after the witnesses as accomplices.

{"description": "In this 1982 courtroom drama written by David Mamet and directed by Sidney Lumet, Paul Newman found the perfect role for a transitional period of his stellar career. As alcoholic Boston lawyer Frank Galvin, Newman shook off his screen persona as a handsome, blue-eyed hunk to portray an aging, weary man whose best years are behind him, with a shot-glass future that looks very bleak indeed. But when Galvin is given a chance to redeem himself--by proving medical negligence in the case of a comatose woman--he makes one final effort to regain his self-respect and tarnished reputation. He's an underdog against formidable odds, facing a powerful, politically connected lawyer (James Mason, slick as ever) who will do anything to win his case, regardless of professional ethics. Further complicating matters is a woman (Charlotte Rampling) who only appears to be worthy of Galvin's trust and love, until Galvin's best friend and colleague (Jack Warden) proves otherwise. Excellent as both courtroom drama and riveting character study, the film crackles with Mamet's sharp dialogue; and Lumet's direction is a brilliant example of forceful restraint. The film gave Newman one of the best roles of his career; many felt he deserved the Oscar (he lost to Ben Kingsley inGandhi) that would belatedly be given to Newman forThe Color of Money. Along withHud,Cool Hand Luke, andButch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,The Verdictranks highly as a signature performance by one of America's all-time greatest actors.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00441GYOM", "6303451462", "0790741040", "0792841859", "B000006N70", "6302479487", "6300214567", "6302130379", "0782008348", "6303072798", "0783235593", "5559477621", "B00005QATY", "6300182479", "630146494X", "6304458975", "0800116917", "6302226899", "0790743213", "0800142039"], "bought_together": ["B00441GYOM"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 217321}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.9, "brand": "", "asin": "6301599896", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Q67JB37ML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Verdict [VHS]"}
{"description": "A tale about a fatherless boy finding dramatically different father figures throughout a remarkable adventure,Treasure Islandis an  entertaining coming-of-age story, with themes of family, loyalty, friendship, trust, and honesty at its core. While Robert Louis Stevenson's classic adventure tale is popular film  fare, it's never been done this well. Charlton Heston stars as Long John Silver and Christian Bale as plucky Jim Hawkins in this TNT production. Directed by Heston's son Fraser (who also directed the excellent family fareAlaska), the film remains faithful to the novel, and draws much of the spirit and excitement of the book. The action scenes are first-rate, and  if the shipHispaniolahas never looked better or more authentic, no surprise: the ship is the original from 1962'sMutiny on the Bounty. The opening scenes are dark and rich, as they capture the period well, with careful attention to makeup (the teeth, the body grime!) and costuming. Oliver Reed and Christopher Lee are frighteningly effective as Capt.&nbsp;Billy Bones and Blind Pew, and the film's first half-hour is theirs. The tone shifts and lightens when Heston appears as the legendary pirate. Look for Pete Postlethwaite, Julian Glover, and Richard Johnson in wonderful supporting roles. The film marks Bale's segue from poignantly promising child actor (Empire of the Sun) to compelling teen (he would later continue to prove his talent as a versatile young actor inLittle WomenandVelvet Goldmine).--N.F.

The now legendaryKoyaanisqatsi, or \"life out of balance,\" was the first.Naqoyqatsi, or \"life in war,\" once it obtains funding, will be the third.Powaqqatsifinds director Godfrey Reggio somewhat more directly polemical than before, and his major collaborator, the composer Philip Glass, stretching to embrace world music.Reggio reuses techniques familiar from the previous film (slow motion, time-lapse, superposition) to dramatize the effects of the so-called First World on the Third: displacement, pollution, alienation. But he spends as much time beautifully depicting what various cultures have lost--cooperative living, a sense of joy in labor, and religious values--as he does confronting viewers with trains, airliners, coal cars, and loneliness. What had been a more or less peaceful, slow-moving, spiritually fulfilling rural existence for these \"silent\" people (all we hear is music and sound effects) becomes a crowded, suffocating, accelerating industrial urban hell, from Peru to Pakistan. Reggio framesPowaqqatsiwith a telling image: the Serra Pelada gold mines, where thousands of men, their clothes and skin imbued with the earth they're moving, carry wet bags up steep slopes in a Sisyphean effort to provide wealth for their employers. While Glass juxtaposes his strangely joyful music, which includes the voices of South American children, a number of these men carry one of their exhausted comrades out of the pit, his head back and arms outstretched--one more sacrifice to Caesar. Nevertheless, Reggio, a former member of the Christian Brothers, seems to maintain hope for renewal.--Robert Burns Neveldine", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 582724}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6301708555", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41gHwjLfZ4L.jpg", "title": "Powaqqatsi [VHS]"}

{"description": "Sometimes simplicity can be heartbreaking. So it is withThe Clock, a wonderfully simple love story that stands as one of the gems of the MGM golden years. It should be noted right off that this 1945 film is not a musical, despite a talent roster led by the maestro of MGM musicals, producer Arthur Freed. Rather, it's a straight, black and white romance about a soldier (Robert Walker) with a two-day pass in unfamiliar, overwhelming New York City. He meets an office worker (Judy Garland), and in the glow of the city and each other, they fall in love. Underlying the sweetness of the romance is the time limit of the soldier's leave, after which he will be sent overseas; the clock brings an urgency to the action, especially after the lovers lose each other in the crush of a subway. Veteran character actor James Gleason provides lovely support, as does his real-life wife, Lucile. Director Vincente Minnelli brought his designer's eye to the film, turning (by his own avowed intention) New York City itself into the third main character in the drama. It's not difficult to guess the reason for the film's strong emotional tug, or for Judy Garland's radiance; Minnelli had fallen in love with Garland during the making ofMeet Me in St. Louisa year earlier, and they would marry after filmingThe Clock. She was never lovelier than in these two pictures.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["630266232X", "6300181111", "B0009J2F1E", "6301977084", "6301967496", "0792840844"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 380091}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 36.88, "brand": "", "asin": "6301967070", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41TNTPM0X1L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Clock [VHS]"}
{"description": "Director Bob Clark's charming, touching, and very funny adaptation of humorist Jean Shepherd's nostalgic, autobiographical Yuletide novel,In God We Trust, All Others Pay Cash, remains essential holiday family viewing. Narrated by a man (Shepherd) recalling his childhood, the film looks back at the compulsive efforts of 7-year-old Ralphie (Peter Billingsley) as he tries every means possible to acquire his dream Christmas gift--a Daisy-brand Red Ryder repeating BB carbine with a compass mounted in the stock. Problem is, he lives in a Norman Rockwell-esque Midwestern town in the 1940s, where his parents, teachers, and even Santa Claus all warn Ralphie that \"he'll shoot his eye out.\" Episodic in nature and seen entirely through the eyes of a child, the film offers a wonderful look at the day-to-day eccentricities that grew out of this conservative period. More interestingly, it cleverly captures childhood urgency, where even the most trivial fantasies or objects become immediate life-or-death necessities. While countless family Christmas movies serve up clich&eacute;d situations suffocating with preachy sermons, Clark's acute eye for detail and odd mixture of warmth, satire, and quirky humor are the reasons why so many viewers have rediscovered this after it initially bombed in the theaters. Sentimental without being syrupy, it's a true rarity: a holiday movie that adults and children can enjoy equally, for completely different reasons and regardless of the season.--Dave McCoy", "related": {"also_bought": ["079070546X", "6301969707", "6303215734", "B00005LOUS", "6302091632", "B001E4TDR2", "B00000JS61", "5559477621", "6304209266", "B0002F6BQU", "6304117752", "6304400551", "6303442447", "6302526574", "6304089767", "6302794331", "6301390725", "6305123616", "0788812807", "6302765536", "6303314015", "B00005LL26", "0307142450", "6301404440", "6300215695", "6303122647", "B000YABV7W", "0793941520", "0783215517", "6302503795", "B00004UGAU", "B000003KLW", "0375810331", "B00004VVP8", "6301912810", "6301578805", "B00004RFHF", "6301300394", "6302090873", "B0000D14JV", "6300157601", "B00000JGEK", "B00008X5J8", "6301928458", "B00000JKNL", "6301627768", "0800139151", "B00001IVED", "B00001YX9H", "6304140738", "6301798503", "6303675212", "6300989003", "B00005A1VG", "6302581907", "0767825985", "6300216993", "6301670140", "6301977742"], "bought_together": ["079070546X"], "also_viewed": ["6301969707", "B00001IVED", "B00005LOUS", "6303215734", "B00006HBUC", "6304117752", "6302914469", "6304500831", "6303212379", "6304400225", "6300274268", "6302787068", "155890641X", "B00000JS61", "6302178924", "6304434340", "B00004VVP8", "6304089767", "6302642248", "B0007KTBIU", "B00005LL26", "0788812408", "6304400551", "B0000AQZYM", "6303314015", "6302961572", "B00005JKDQ", "6304718551", "B0002F6BQU", "0783231482", "0792839846", "B000028U3S", "B00006FDMY", "6303123244", "B00003CX7L", "6305123616", "B00003CX8I", "6302320402", "0790719029", "6300213668", "6304143184", "1560395966", "B00005O5ML", "6302503795", "B00000K4ZI", "0788805843", "0790742578", "6303212395", "1560395737", "6303338690", "6302091632", "6304290888", "0790700506", "0790742322", "B00000490M", "B00004TX1W", "6304539274", "B00004RFHF", "6304151306"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 318159}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6301966554", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/512TVV2E0DL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "A Christmas Story [VHS]"}

{"description": "The beat goes on forStargate SG-1in this five-disc set containing all 20 episodes from the show's eighth season. If that beat is now a bit more faint than in previous years, that's not particularly surprising when a franchise has been around this long; what's more, if Season 8 has some fairly odd aspects to it (\"Threads,\" which appears to have been planned as the final episode of the entire series, is followed by two more in this set alone&#x85; not to mention an unexpected renewal that led to an all-new Season 9), that too isn't exactly unusual in the wacky world of series television.Some significant changes are apparent in Season 8. Jack O'Neill (series star Richard Dean Anderson) has been promoted to Brigadier General and is now top dog (as he puts it, the guy who \"spent my whole life stickin' it to the man\" nowisthe man). The existence of the stargate, an artificially created \"wormhole\" through which one can instantly travel to different worlds light years away from Earth, is no longer a well-guarded secret. And Stargate Command itself now exists primarily to \"develop new weapons and technologies to defend the planet\" from our various alien antagonists--principally the \"Replicators,\" relentless little bug-machines poised to take over not only Earth but the entire galaxy.The rest of the SG-1 core cast (Amanda Tapping, Christopher Judge, and Michael Shanks) is intact. But whereas Anderson, who has steadily reduced his role in the show, wasn't much missed in Season 7, one wishes there were more of him this time around; O'Neill's general insouciance and aversion to techno-speak are a welcome antidote to the kind of sci-fi gobbledygook (discussions about \"a time dilation field on the planet Hala\" and such) that now threatens to take precedence over the action and fine special effects that distinguished earlier seasons. Most of all, while there are still all manner of villains (Anubis, Ba'al, the ever-present Goa'uld) to contend with, as well as a few good guys (the Asgard, the rebel Jaffa) to help our heroes fight the good fight,Stargate SG-1's writers and creators may be running out of steam. Hence we get an episode like the very peculiar \"Citizen Joe,\" featuring Dan Castellaneta as an average guy who sees \"visions\" (i.e., clips from past episodes) of the SG-1 team in action and becomes obsessed with proving that the whole stargate project really exists; an uneasy combination of self-parody and self-congratulation, this episode, while not unamusing, sticks out like a sore thumb.Bonus features include audio commentary (mostly by the various directors) on 19 of the 20 episodes, along with photo galleries and one featurette per disc. --Sam Graham", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000F8O2PQ", "B000HEZEY6", "B000PMFRTC", "B000F8O2PG", "6303961614", "B000F8O2P6", "B000F8O2OW", "B000F8O2OM", "B000F8O2Q0", "B0010YSD7M", "B000B8IA2G", "B0017MO10U", "B000LC4ZI0", "B000RW3YYA", "B0017MO11O", "B00243FQFA", "B0029WLJHK", "B00402FGE4", "B004TJ1H3C", "B001MT7ZIS", "B002EL4RLQ", "B0000844I8", "B00G4RBBQK", "B001MT7ZL0", "B004WJT5H4", "B002KPINY8", "B0093LE30U", "B001BVRNPW", "B0017XOF5A", "B0093LE3BO", "B0093LE33C", "B0009299PG", "B0093LE32S", "B00402FGEE", "B0093LE3C8", "B002BAW6FE", "B0006FO9B0", "B002BAW6H2", "B004X60QWO", "B00242KD1S", "B003L77GUG", "B004X60QE2", "B002BAW6FY", "B00GTZWXYQ", "B0007TKH66", "B000AJJNFE", "B003L77GWE", "B00G4RH1VE", "B005PPMHWE", "B005PPMHO2", "B0032JTUX4", "B004HYW84G", "B002BAW6GI", "B00BI6SRKK", "B002BWP2IK", "B009LDCXQQ", "B003XMKU3Y", "B007USE5CE", "B002DUJ9Q6", "B00IWTVDUW", "B00E688AZE", "B002ZCY872", "B002BAW6GS", "B001TH16DS", "B00129W6LE", "B002HRF68A", "B008I34Z34", "B001CQONMC", "B000BNI90Y", "B004EXWGHY", "B0048FUUAI", "B00E688720", "B0012Z36FI", "B004NTC7EG", "B000WTZ6SK", "B0083TUEHY", "B00404ME2E", "B001RHGRTS", "B008R52LA2", "B007XF0XVQ", "B00G4RDDBG", "B000FJH5M2", "B00F3L8P26", "B00B5ARKC0", "B00GTZWZH6", "B00062IDDS", "B002JVWRAY", "B002GP7ZVO", "B001A7GOCA", "B000BR9SA0", "B000E5N6B6", "B0081QF6Q8", "B0000015NX", "B0095XPZBC", "B00AMDA2QC", "B00BD6K54G", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B0009JE6G6", "B004QOB8TS", "B00IURL19Y"], "bought_together": ["B000F8O2PQ", "B000HEZEY6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000F8O2OM", "B000F8O2Q0", "B000F8O2PQ", "B000F8O2OW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 4525}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 14.95, "brand": "ANDERSON,RICHARD DE", "asin": "6302020190", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51C5rROs2YL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Stargate SG-1 - Season 8"}

Irons won an Oscar for his spooky, knowing performance, which hints at depths of degeneracy without ever putting a dent in a veneer of bored elegance.

While kung fu warriors and otherworldly spirits battle over the fate of two women (Kim Cattrall and Suzee Pai), Russell's swaggering idiot manages to knock himself out or underestimate the forces he's dealing with. The whole thing is dopey, but it's supposed to be dopey and Russell's game performance brings an ironic edge.

{"description": "Thelma & Louiseis a feminist manifesto writ large on the big screen, a smart and funny gender reversal of the standard Hollywood buddy formula, a road movie extraordinaire, with characters who became instant cultural icons. No matter how you define it, Ridley Scott's 1991 box-office hit pinched a nerve and made the cover of national news magazines for tweaking gender politics like no movie before or since. Callie Khouri's screenplay overhauls the buddy formula with its story about two best friends (Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis) who embark on a liberating adventure that turns into an interstate police chase after a traumatic incident makes both women into fugitives; they are en route to a destiny they could never have imagined. The perfect casting of Sarandon and Davis makesThelma & Louisea movie for the ages, and Brad Pitt became an overnight star after his appearance as the con-artist cowboy who gives Davis a memorable (but costly) night in a roadside motel.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301796535", "6304938756", "B0000TANUI", "6300182304", "B000C20VRS", "6302642248", "B004IFIMT4", "6302526574", "6300269728", "0790749246", "6300182533", "B00003OSTO", "0790734060", "6300214044", "6300214222", "0790737566", "B00329TVQA", "B00004RFFA", "1556587864", "6304504012", "6300214753", "6300247236", "6302023742", "B00003CXTF", "6302130379"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 239563}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.96, "brand": "", "asin": "6302250269", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51YYTDEG0QL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Thelma &amp; Louise [VHS]"}

Four gunmen, disguised in rubber masks of ex-U.S.  presidents, have never come close to being caught, but veteran agent Gary Busey  has a theory: The bandits are surfers. This prompts the superb line, \"The ex-presidents rip off banks to finance the endless summer!\" This movie's full of  dialogue like that, but instead of sounding ridiculous it creates its own  infectious comic-book energy--ride the crest of it and you'll find the film's  giddy zone. Patrick Swayze plays Bodhi, zen-master leader of the surfing clan,  humming serenely with the wisdom of the waves. (Alarmingly, Swayze also did his  own skydiving stunts.) Director Kathryn Bigelow (Strange Days) stages the  action sequences with a visceral snap, and clearly has a gift for orchestrating  pulp fiction.

{"description": "The \"lost\" sleeper hit of 1980 has since become one of the most revered cult movies of all time, largely due to its bawdy, irreverent story about the art and artifice of filmmaking and an outrageously clever performance by Peter O'Toole. As megalomaniacal film director Eli Cross, O'Toole plays a larger-than-life figure whose ability to manipulate reality is like a power-trip narcotic. The focus of his latest mind game is a fugitive (Steve Railsback) recruited to replace a stuntman killed during a recent on-set accident. In return for protective sanctuary, the fugitive takes a crash course in stunt work but soon discovers that he's the paranoid player in a game he can't control, with the dictatorial director making up the rules. Or is he?The Stunt Manis a game of its own, played through the fantasy of filmmaking, and half the fun of watching the movie comes from sharing the stuntman's paranoid confusion. Barbara Hershey has a smart, sexy supporting role as a lead actress who won't submit to her director's seemingly devious behavior; but it's clearly O'Toole who steals the show. Director Richard Rush adds to the movie's maverick appeal--in a career plagued by struggles against the mainstream studio system, Rush hasn't made a better movie before or since.The Stunt Manclearly represents the potential of his neglected talent.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0800116917", "6301016289", "6303562248"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 478717}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.97, "brand": "", "asin": "6302260973", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RB3Q3HJDL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Stunt Man [VHS]"}
{"description": "Missionaries travel to the Brazilian rain forest and make a mess of everything. What else is new? Actually, plenty in this dark but beautifully realized adaptation of Peter Matthiessen's well-regarded novel, directed by Hector Babenco. Aidan Quinn, Daryl Hannah, Kathy Bates, and John Lithgow play the Americans who travel to the Brazilian interior in an effort to do some good. But their definitions of good vary wildly; Bates and Lithgow are old-fashioned puritans who want to convert the heathens to Christianity and remove all traces of their own culture. Quinn and Hannah are more spiritually minded, hoping to make a connection and a cultural exchange with the Indians they encounter. In the end, they're all delusional, trapped in their own preconceptions.

{"description": "Australian model George Lazenby took up the mantle of the world's most suave secret agent when Sean Connery retired as James Bond--prematurely, it turned out. Connery returned inDiamonds Are Foreverbefore leaving the role to Roger Moore and Lazenby's subsequent career fizzled, yet this one-hit wonder is responsible for one of the best Bond films of all time.InOn Her Majesty's Secret Service, 007 leaves the Service to privately  pursue his SPECTRE nemesis Blofeld (played this time by Telly Savalas), whose latest master plan involves a threat to the world's crops by agricultural sterilization. Bond teams up with suave international crime lord Draco (Gabriele Ferzetti) and falls in love with--and marries--his elegant daughter, Tracy (Diana Rigg). Bond goes monogamous? Not at first; after all he has Blofeld's harem to seduce. Lazenby hasn't the intensity of Connery but he has fun with his quips and even lampoons the Bond image in a playful pre-credits sequence, and Rigg, fresh from playing sexy Emma Peel inThe Avengers, matches 007 in every way. Former editor Peter Hunt makes a strong directorial debut, deftly handling the elaborate action sequences--including a car chase turned road rally through the icy snow--with a kinetic finesse and a dash of humor.

She's played by Paulette Goddard, then Chaplin's wife and probably his best leading lady (here and inThe Great Dictator). The film's theme gave the increasingly ambitious writer-director a chance to speak out about social issues, as well as indulging in the bittersweet quality of pathos that critics were already calling \"Chaplinesque.\" In 1936, Chaplin was still holding out against spoken dialogue in films, but he did use a synchronized soundtrack of sound effects and his own music, a score that includes one of his most famous melodies, \"Smile.\" And late in the film, Chaplin actually does speak--albeit in a garbled gibberish song, a rebuke to modern times in talking pictures.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["630256185X", "6302561817", "6302561825", "6302561949", "6302561833", "6302561957", "B00004TX2C", "6302561965"], "bought_together": ["630256185X"], "also_viewed": ["6302561825"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 301935}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6302561841", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71W9ZSV0YWL._SY300_.gif", "title": "Modern Times [VHS]"}

{"description": "When they say they don't make 'em like they used to, they're talking  about 20th Century Fox's exhilaratingThe Mark of Zorro, starring Tyrone Power as the caped one, Linda Darnell as his love interest, and Basil Rathbone at his scurrilous best as Zorro's nemesis. More textured than the1920 originalwith Douglas Fairbanks, this 1940 version has Don Diego/Zorro (Powers) returning from Madrid to defend his father and rally the caballeros (noblemen) against Los Angeles's corrupt new governor (J. Edward Bromberg), intent on taxing the peons to death.If this all sounds like an Old California redo of the classicAdventures of Robin Hood, that's because it is. Powers has a field day as Don Diego, the \"fancy clown\" betrothed to the governor's niece, Lolita (Darnell). Don Diego the effete snob performs silly parlor tricks, peers through pince-nez, and yawns disdainfully at one and all. Power's cowardly alter ego is so believable, his transformation to masked superhero becomes all the more thrilling. Imagine Captain Pasquale's (Rathbone) shock when, in the film's brilliantly choreographed showdown, this annoying fop turns out to be a world-class swordsman.Director Rouben Mamoulian, known for great period melodramas, does a skillful job of alternating garrison intrigue with big action scenes, including a nighttime ride that climaxes with Zorro on horseback leaping off a bridge. In the romantic highlight, Lolita confides her innermost desires to a suspiciously worldly friar. The first-rate supporting cast includes Gale Sondergaard as the governor's treacherous wife and the frog-voiced Eugene Pallette (Friar Tuck inThe Adventures of Robin Hood) as a padre in cahoots with the masked one. Technically, this retelling rates an unqualified \"Wow!\" The cinematography, obviously influenced by Goya, makes full use of chiaroscuro shadows, and Alfred Newman's Latin-flavored score is irresistibly rousing and romantic.--Glenn Lovell", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303943004", "B000NTPG66", "B00407PNWO", "6300181111", "0800100832", "6302413435", "6302909023", "6303562248", "6301798503", "6303039693", "0792844564", "6302224489", "6301967410", "6301969561", "6301734734", "6301965701", "0790743213", "1558807780", "6303393985", "6303102506", "6301971426", "6300215741", "6301798708", "6300269795", "630266232X", "6300181472", "0782006779", "6303120474", "0800132009", "6305012792", "6302226899", "0800113055", "0790733935", "6300215644", "6301976207", "6301797906", "6302801133", "B00005A1VH", "6300275213", "B00004TX24", "B0000040EO", "6301977149", "6302305942", "6302800897", "630442972X", "6300267970", "6301978536", "B000007PI9", "B00004R67T", "6302415853"], "bought_together": ["B00407PNWO"], "also_viewed": ["B0012VCMSY", "B008VR7U0M"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 333985}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.88, "brand": "", "asin": "6302700949", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51KYMS6Q3QL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Mark Of Zorro [VHS]"}

Full-screen presentation ofThe ShiningandFull Metal Jacketwas also approved by Kubrick, who recomposed his original framing,  reportedly believing that those films looked best on video in the full-screen format. (In fact, the original theatrical aspect ratio ofThe Shiningwas 1.66:1, meaning that a relatively small portion of the image is lost.) Kubrick also chose mono over stereo,  believing that inconsistencies in theatrical sound systems resulted in loss of control over theatrical presentation.

Cage then flashes back to their boyhood, where Birdy, a canary aficionado, was considered the school weirdo but managed to be a solid companion nonetheless. Directed by Alan Parker, it works best as a coming-of-age story, but misses the bizarre psychological transferences of the book, in which Birdy imagines himself within the world of canaries he creates in his bedroom at his parents' house.

{"description": "Certain to remain one of the greatest haunted-house movies ever made, Robert Wise'sThe Haunting(1963) is antithetical to all the gory horror films of subsequent decades, because its considerable frights remain implicitly rooted in the viewer's sensitivity to abject fear. A classic spook-fest based on Shirley Jackson's novelThe Haunting of Hill House(which also inspired the 1999 remake directed by Jan de Bont), the film begins with a prologue that concisely establishes the dark history of Hill House, a massive New England mansion (actually filmed in England) that will play host to four daring guests determined to investigate--and hopefully debunk--the legacy of death and ghostly possession that has given the mansion its terrifying reputation.Consumed by guilt and grief over her mother's recent death and driven to adventure by her belief in the supernatural, Eleanor Vance (Julie Harris) is the most unstable--and therefore the most vulnerable--visitor to Hill House. She's invited there by anthropologist Dr. Markway (Richard Johnson), along with the bohemian lesbian Theodora (Claire Bloom), who has acute extra-sensory abilities, and glib playboy Luke Sanderson (Russ Tamblyn, from Wise'sWest Side Story), who will gladly inherit Hill House if it proves to be hospitable. Of course, the shadowy mansion is anything but welcoming to its unwanted intruders. Strange noises, from muffled wails to deafening pounding, set the stage for even scarier occurrences, including a door that appears tobreathe(with a slowly turning doorknob that's almost unbearably suspenseful), unexplained writing on walls, and a delicate spiral staircase that seems to have a life of its own.The genius ofThe Hauntinglies in the restraint of Wise and screenwriter Nelson Gidding, who elicit almost all of the film's mounting terror from the psychology of its characters--particularly Eleanor, whose grip on sanity grows increasingly tenuous. The presence of lurking spirits relies heavily on the power of suggestion (likewise the cautious handling of Theodora's attraction to Eleanor) and the film's use of sound is more terrifying than anything Wise could have shown with his camera. Like Jack Clayton's 1961 chiller,The Innocents,The Hauntingknows the value of planting the seeds of terror in the mind, as opposed to letting them blossom graphically on the screen. What you don't see is infinitely more frightening than what you do, and with nary a severed head or bloody corpse in sight,The Hauntingis guaranteed to chill you to the bone.--Jeff Shannon", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 433958}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6302872766", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5169GTZZBNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Haunting [VHS]"}

{"description": "A refutation of then-President George Bush's notion of 1,000 points of light, this film by director Tim Hunter is about what happened when holes in the social safety net created a homeless population of unprecedented size during the Reagan-Bush years. The film focuses on two of the homeless: a sweet but troubled young man (Matt Dillon) and a more rugged, worldly-wise homeless Vietnam veteran (Danny Glover), who befriends him and tries to teach him how to survive on the streets. Dillon's character is schizophrenic, unable to get the medication or attention he needs to treat his problem. Instead, he winds up in a Manhattan men's shelter, a kind of Darwinian house of horrors haunted by streetwise predators (led by a scary Ving Rhames). Though overly sentimentalized at times, the film also serves as an indictment of a system that lets too many people like Dillon's character slip through the cracks.--Marshall Fine", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 326143}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.11, "brand": "", "asin": "6303046959", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41500ZENGNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Saint of Fort Washington [VHS]"}

Instead of getting on her feet, however, Karin begins disintegrating after realizing she no longer loves her physician husband (Max von Sydow) and is being rather coldly observed by her writer father (Gunnar Bjornstrand), whose distant fascination with her plight is recorded in his daily journal.

Blue is the most somber of the three, a movie dominated by feelings of grief. As the film begins, a car accident claims the life of a well-known composer. His wife, played by Juliette Binoche (Oscar winner forThe English Patient), does not so much put the pieces of her life back together as start an entirely new existence. She moves to Paris, where she dissolves into a wordless life virtually without other people. Kieslowski attaches an almost subconscious significance to the color blue, but primarily he focuses on Binoche's luminous face, and the way her subtle shifts in emotion flicker and disappear. The picture may be more enigmatic than the follow-upsWhiteandRed, but Binoche's quiet, heartbreaking presence becomes spellbinding; her performance won the best actress prize at the Venice Film Festival in 1993.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303326838", "6303486762", "6302508754"], "bought_together": ["6303326838", "6303486762"], "also_viewed": ["B005HK13T0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 467897}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6303160344", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518273SKGYL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Blue [VHS]"}

{"description": "Richard Donner's 1978 epic about the Man of Steel showed how a film about a superhero could be a moving and romantic experience even for people who long ago gave up comic books. Beginning on the icy planet Krypton, the story follows the baby Kal-El, whose rocket ship lands in Smallville, Kansas. He is found there by a childless couple and raised as the shy Clark Kent (the young Kent is played by Jeff East). The film is perhaps most touching in these sequences, with expanses of wheat fields blowing in the wind and with a young man who can't figure out what part in destiny his great powers are meant to play. The second half, with Reeve taking over as Clark/Superman, is bustling, enchanting (the scene in which Superman flies girlfriend Lois Lane--played by Margot Kidder--through the night sky is great date material), and funny, thanks largely to Gene Hackman's sardonic portrayal of nemesis Lex Luthor.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300268993", "B000059XYC", "6300270122", "6303020089", "B000059XXZ", "0784011923", "B0002XNSYA", "B00005A1VG", "6303506291", "6301969413", "0800198395", "6302941318", "6304509154", "630196649X", "6304508611", "0790731975", "0790700506", "6300181537", "B000059XY5", "0790733897", "B00000JGEI", "6300214311", "6304047843", "6302238331", "6300214060", "630407185X", "6303148352", "6303212379", "6302510023", "0783216084", "B00004TYS8", "6302380294", "0790744589", "0792133153", "6302091632", "6302098424", "6304143184", "B0000068SI", "B00004RNAC", "6302510031", "630251018X", "6302510015", "B0000CDL3W", "6302510198", "B0001VL30O", "B000006FNX", "6302909023", "B000065U6Q", "6302032377"], "bought_together": ["6300268993", "B000059XYC"], "also_viewed": ["B000IJ79WU", "6300268993", "B000059Z8K", "B000P6XQ50", "B0039208JE", "6300270122", "B000IJ79VQ", "B000059XYC", "B000IJ79X4", "B001DJLD2G", "B000059XXZ", "B00F4FFO8E", "B00005JKCH", "6302642248", "6303953425", "B00005LIRF", "B00EAPMGIU", "B000IJ79XE", "B00BBND56G", "0790734079", "0784011923", "B000VI70QS", "B00005LKLF", "B000059Z8L", "B000UR9T8C", "B00005JXY3", "B0039208QM", "6303506291", "B0016MOWOQ", "B0087F7VSY", "B00000GUNY", "0783222726", "B00DYEN6XC", "B00E5I2MCM", "B0090SI582", "B00JPS6A3O", "B0057R5XRG", "B008JFUO72", "B008JFUS0U"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 202304}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.75, "brand": "", "asin": "6303212263", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51E39PXF9BL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Superman the Movie [VHS]"}
{"description": "Woody Allen combined the best parts of his earlier films in creating HANNAH AND HER SISTERS, his 1986 masterwork about the changing relationships among three sisters living in New York City. Hannah (Mia Farrow) has put her acting career aside in order to take care of her family with second husband Elliot (Michael Caine in an Oscar-winning performance). Elliot has fallen in love with Hannah's sister Lee (Barbara Hershey), who herself is feeling suffocated by her cynical, mean-spirited loner of a lover, played with great intensity by Ingmar Bergman regular Max von Sydow. Meanwhile, third sister Holly (Oscar winnner Dianne Wiest) is struggling to find her own voice, working as a caterer while she tries to get her own acting career going. And in the middle of everything is Mickey (Woody Allen at his most neurotic), a television writer who is divorced from Hannah, has dated Holly, and, when he suspects he might have a brain tumor, decides to re-evaluate his life and his faith in God. HANNAH AND HER SISTERS is Allen's most fully realized, optimistic adult comedy. He won a well-deserved Oscar for his marvelous screenplay, filled with his trademark sharp, witty dialogue, his undying passion for New York (its culture, architecture, music, romance), and some of his most well-developed characters. The cast is extraordinary, the music illuminating, the settings magnificent. Taking place over the course of a few Thanksgivings, Allen's insightful, wonderful film is a thoroughly enjoyable mature look at the trials, tribulations, and triumphs of family life.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005AUJL", "6301963911", "6301964365", "6304039166", "630146494X", "6300216365", "6301972147", "6301971922", "630228175X", "6302718910", "0800102371", "6303430546", "6303011411", "B0000068DV", "6302697042", "6300251012"]}, "price": 13.31, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 442883}, "asin": "6303232663", "imUrl": "http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-site/icons/no-img-sm._CB192198896_.gif", "title": "Hannah &amp; Her Sisters [VHS]"}

{"description": "Edward D. Wood Jr. was an actor writer-director-producer, occasionally in drag, who combined meager bursts of talent with an undying optimism to create some of the most bizarrely memorable \"B\" movies to ever come out of Tinseltown. Though Wood died in obscurity as an alcoholic in 1978, his films have been considered cult classics for years. He is consistently voted the worst director who ever lived. You would think this an odd subject, but director Tim Burton harnesses the undying hopefulness that made Wood such a character. Shot in black and white, just like Wood's creations, this stylized, witty production captures the poetic absurdity of Wood's films and his unconventional life. Burton's recreation of Wood's wonderfully awfulPlan 9 from Outer Spacelooks much better than the original low-budget quickie. Burton tackled an extremely strange subject matter for a biopic, but Wood is presented as naive almost to the point of delusion, so the story works. The pace sags in the middle, as the weirdness starts to wear thin, but Depp proves himself an adroit actor, even while wearing angora and a blonde wig. Wood's unconventional repertoire company is faithfully reproduced, including an Academy Award-winning Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi. Landau is pathetic, droll, and charismatic as the elderly junkie who made his last screen appearances in Wood's films.--Rochelle O'Gorman", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301763041", "0800187873"], "bought_together": ["6301763041"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 314635}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.87, "brand": "", "asin": "6303407188", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51F97RJE9XL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Ed Wood [VHS]"}

Her courtesy call to the mother of her deceased lover turns into a cat-and-mouse thriller as the dotty, scripture-reading old lady dedicates herself to \"cleansing\" the befouled girl in memory of her son. Richard Matheson's smart screenplay (from the novelNightmareby Anne Blaisdell) gives Powers a scrappy character, defying Bankhead and struggling to escape at every turn, while Bankhead's increasingly deranged campaign is given a delicious dimension with a marvelously schizophrenic backstory. Director Silvio Narizzano tends to overplay his hand at times and at one point steals a scene right out ofPsycho, but he happily makes the battle of wits the central focus, letting the gothic elements stand as flourish.

{"description": "The Fab Four from Liverpool--John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr--in their first movie. Nobody expectedA Hard Day's Nightto be much more than a quick exploitation of a passing musical fad, but when the film opened it immediately seduced the world--even the stuffiest critics fell over themselves in praise (highbrow Dwight Macdonald called it \"not only a gay, spontaneous, inventive comedy but it is also as good cinema as I have seen for a long time\"). Wisely, screenwriter Alun Owen based his script on the Beatles' actual celebrity at the time, catching them in the delirious early rush of Beatlemania: eluding rampaging fans, killing time on trains and in hotels, appearing on a TV broadcast. American director Richard Lester, influenced by the freestyle French New Wave and BritishGoon Showhumor, whips up a delightfully upbeat circus of perpetual motion. From the opening scene of the mop tops rushing through a train station mobbed by fans, the movie rarely stops for air.

{"description": "The definitive screen adaptation of Henry James'sThe Turn of the Screw, the 1961 production ofThe Innocentsremains one of the most effective ghost stories ever filmed. Originally promoted as the first truly \"adult\" chiller of the big screen (a marginally valid claim considering the release ofPsychoa year earlier), the film arrived at a time when the thematic depth of James's story could finally be addressed without the compromise of reductive discretion. And while the Freudian anxiety that fuels the story may seem tame by today's standards, the psychological horrors that comprise the story's \"dark secret\" are given full expression in a film that brilliantly clouds the boundary between tragic reality and frightful imagination.In one of her finest performances, Deborah Kerr stars as Miss Giddons, a devout and somewhat repressed spinster who happily accepts the position of governess for two orphaned children whose uncle (Michael Redgrave) readily admits to having no interest in being tied down by two \"brats.\" So Miss Giddons is dispatched to Bly House, the lavish, shadowy estate where young Flora (Pamela Franklin) and her brother Miles (Martin Stephens, so memorable in 1960'sVillage of the Damned) live with a good-natured housekeeper (Megs Jenkins). At first, life at Bly House seems splendidly idyllic, but as Miss Giddons learns the horrible truth about the estate's now-deceased groundskeeper and previous governess, she begins to suspect that her young charges are ensnared in a devious plot from beyond the grave.Ghostly images are revealed in only the most fleeting glimpses, and the outstanding Cinemascope photography by Freddie Francis (who used special filters to subtly darken the edges of the screen) turns Bly House into a welcoming mansion by day, a maze of mystery and terror by night. Sound effects and music are used to bone-chilling effect, and director Jack Clayton, blessed with a script by William Archibald and Truman Capote, maintains a deliberate pace to emphasize the ambiguity of James's timeless novella. The result is a masterful film--comparable to the 1963 classicThe Haunting--that uses subtlety and suggestion to reach the pinnacle of fear.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302180015", "B0009A2PQI", "6301797957"], "also_viewed": ["B000060MVG"]}, "price": 33.96, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 383381}, "asin": "6303957064", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51778QWGJKL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Innocents [VHS]"}
{"description": "Rock Hudson and Doris Day had one of the sweetest chemistries in the movies--as demonstrated in several light comedies, including this film's predecessor, 1959'sPillow Talk. The two similar films feature a handsome, duplicitous Hudson duping--then falling for--an earnest Day. InLover Come Back, the two play Jerry Webster and Carol Templeton, rival advertising agents, vying for the same clients--until Jerry makes up a product, Vip, to get out of a scrape. As Madison Avenue catches Vip fever, Jerry falls deeper into the fa&ccedil;ade-and into love with Carol, who schemes to steal the nonexistent account away from him. Tony Randall plays Peter Ramsay, Webster's hapless boss. While Day and Hudson are as adorable as ever (and would continue to be in 1964'sSend Me No Flowers), a standout is fellowPillow TalkandSend Me No Flowerscostar Randall. He's an effective foil--both comically and physically (as he stands next to the much taller Hudson). Their brands of humor blend charmingly: Hudson's sardonic coyness, Day's innocent sweetness, and Randall's nervous edginess. Look for a pre-Brady BunchAnn B.

{"description": "Veronica Sawyer (Winona Ryder) has sacrificed everything in order to preserve her place in Westerburg High's most impenetrable social clique, the HEATHERS. As the only member of the group not named \"Heather\", Veronica has to work extra hard just to stay afloat. Going against her own morals and intelligence, Veronica succumbs to peer pressure on a daily basis, faking her delight in the humiliation of the school's less popular students. Bored of the frat parties and cow tipping so popular among her friends, Veronica's curiosity is peaked when a mysterious new guy named J.D. comes to town. The dark, brooding J.D. (Christian Slater at his best) observes Veronica among her pack in the lunchroom (where social hierarchy is most clearly displayed), concluding that Veronica is not a Heather at heart. When Veronica confides in J.D. that she hates her friends and wishes Heather #1 was dead, she never expects her words to have such dire consequences. Before she knows what's happening, J.D. is dragging Veronica on a killing spree staged as a teen suicide outbreak. But as Veronica soon learns, even death cannot stop the HEATHERS. As one Heather dies, her red scrunchee (the symbol of all power) gets passed on to the next Heather in line, and the clique that was the HEATHERS starts to feel like an inescapable social disease. How far will this war for popularity go? By far the darkest of teen comedies, HEATHERS invented a vocabulary of teen-speak all its own, asking questions like \"What's your damage?\" and introducing phrases like \"How very\". Director Michael Lehmann successfully blends the horror, comedy, and teen movie genres, creating a truly original film. Full of dark humor and deeply sardonic messages, HEATHERS takes a fresh look at the often-sugarcoated cinematic world of high school. Set in the 1980's, the film feels timeless in its relevance because of the daring nature of its themes.", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300183416", "B00005T33W", "0767819586", "B000065RCD"], "bought_together": ["6300183416"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 590283}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.94, "brand": "", "asin": "6304361009", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51BZA4724XL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Heathers [VHS]"}
{"description": "At his best, director John Woo turns action movies into ballets of blood and bullets grounded in character drama.Face/Offmarks Woo's first American film to reach the pitched level of his best Hong Kong work (Hard-Boiled). He takes a patently absurd premise--hero and villain exchange identities by literally swapping faces in science-fiction plastic surgery--and creates a double-barreled revenge film driven by the split psyches of its newly redefined characters. FBI agent Sean Archer (John Travolta) must play the villain to move through the underworld while psychotic terrorist Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage) becomes a perversely paternal family man while using every tool at his disposal to destroy his nemesis. Travolta vamps Cage's tics and flamboyant excess with the grace of a dancer after his transformation from cop to criminal, while Cage plays the sullen, bottled-up agent excruciatingly trapped behind the face of the man who killed his son. His attempts to live up to the terrorist's reputation become cathartic explosions of violence that both thrill and terrify him. This is merely icing on the cake for action fans, the dramatic backbone for some of the most visceral action thrills ever. Woo fills the screen with one show-stopping set piece after another, bringing a poetic grace to the action freakout with sweeping camerawork and sophisticated editing. This marriage of melodrama and mayhem ups the ante from cops-and-robbers clich&eacute;s to a conflict of near-mythic levels.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792116887", "0792133153", "0800125762", "B00006IUNT", "6304259131", "6304681496", "B00004WIDB", "079212569X", "6302816629", "6304258984", "B00005PJ8I", "B00003CXTF", "B000007OY0"], "bought_together": ["0792116887"], "also_viewed": ["6304259158"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 280197}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.39, "brand": "Paramount", "asin": "6304618344", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71PMMMZ3CYL._SY300_.gif", "title": "Face/Off [VHS]"}
{"description": "With each passing year bringing another high-profile rock reunion,  prompted as often by balloon mortgage payments as any real artistic hunger, old  fans could be excused for greeting 1997's announcement that the big Mac was back  with skepticism:  at their commercial zenith, Fleetwood Mac had offered superb  transatlantic pop-rock with the added spice of a remarkable back-story, but the  band's long decline and underwhelming later personnel shifts didn't bode  well.Such guarded expectations make the musical punch ofThe Danceall the  more impressive, and enable the meticulously produced concert special to  genuinely surprise. The band's musicianship&#x96;-the one constant between the  original, late '60s English blues band and its platinum '70s lineup featuring  guitarist Lindsey Buckingham and singer Stevie Nicks&#x96;-is in peak form,  buttressed by a discreet auxiliary of additional musicians. Even with the hired  guns, though, it's the rock-solid rhythm section of founders Mick Fleetwood and  John McVie, and Buckingham's impassioned playing that strike sparks. Always a  dynamic guitarist, Buckingham brings feverish intensity to both group classics  and solo turns such as \"Go Insane.\"Both familiar hits and new songs (including the solid \"Temporary One\" and \"Bleed  to Love Her\") further confirm that this isn't a rote exercise-&#x96;the band sounds  fully engaged. Buckingham, Nicks, and the elegant Christine McVie retain their  vocal charm (although Nicks has clearly lost her upper register). And the sense  of old wounds healed, and older affections acknowledged, gives true poignancy to  the set's high mark, a brilliant live version of \"Silver Springs,\" a truly  hauntingRumours-era B-side that proves deeply moving.--Sam  Sutherland", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 340029}, "categories": [["CDs & Vinyl", "Pop", "Adult Contemporary"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Pop", "Soft Rock"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Rock"], ["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 5.55, "brand": "", "asin": "6304639457", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Gx7AaVfCL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Fleetwood Mac: The Dance   [VHS]"}
{"description": "Halloweenis as pure and undiluted as its title.  In the small town of Haddonfield, Illinois, a teenage baby sitter  tries to survive a Halloween night of relentless terror, during which  a knife-wielding maniac goes after the town's hormonally charged  youths. Director John Carpenter takes this simple situation and  orchestrates a superbly mounted symphony of horrors. It's a movie much scarier for its dark spaces and ominous camera movements  than for its explicit bloodletting (which is actually minimal). Composed  by Carpenter himself, the movie's freaky music sets the tone; and his  script (cowritten with Debra Hill) is laced with references to other  horror pictures, especiallyPsycho. The baby sitter is played  by Jamie Lee Curtis, the real-life daughter ofPsychovictim  Janet Leigh; and the obsessed policeman played by Donald Pleasence  is named Sam Loomis, after John Gavin's character inPsycho.  In the end, though,Halloweenstands on its own as an  uncannily frightening experience--it's one of those movies that had  audiences literally jumping out of their seats and shouting at the  screen. (\"No! Don't drop that knife!\") Produced on a low budget,  the picture turned a monster profit, and spawned many sequels,  none of which approached the 1978 original. Curtis returned for two  more installments: 1981's dismalHalloween II, which picked  up the story the day after the unfortunate events, and 1998's occasionally  grippingHalloween H20, which proved the former baby sitter  was still haunted after 20 years.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005LC4Q", "B000FA57UI", "B000FA57US", "B000Q66Q2O", "B005CFC0N8", "B004P7CNUY", "B0000AOX09", "B004P7CM9Q", "B000VKL6Z2", "B00006LPHA", "B002XD0J80", "B00AQJ8MLY", "B001NPD9LS", "B002YICNE2", "B000GETUDI", "B000FS9FE4", "B001DJLD1W", "B00AEFY2LO", "B00006FI0R", "B00AEFY2WI", "B005CFBYW6", "B00006FDBT", "B00AEFY31S", "B00AEFY37C", "B00005K3NR", "B00004TS0G", "B003UGLCIA", "B0087ZG7UW", "B000I2J68M", "B000V4UFZK", "B0000VCZMK", "B0033B5XCS", "B000AM6OQ2", "B0002JP572", "B002VWNIDG", "B0058S0OMS", "B000099T3M", "B00AEFY1V0", "B002ZG971U", "B00AEFYYH6", "B00003CXCF", "B004LWZW2O", "B001B1UO6W", "B00006FDCD", "B000E1ZBIG", "B004SIP9MY", "B000TSIJWY", "B000WC3864", "B004AC6PMG", "B001DJLD0S", "B000QQJ3Q0", "B004P7CMT6", "B0002CHK1S", "B000FC2GA0", "B008CYDD7I", "B0008191WO", "B0024FADD8", "B0053TWVDC", "B00018D42W", "B00AEFY2AA", "B00DTPRZ24", "B000KJU1KK", "B00AEFY2E6", "B0000CEB6Y", "B0006SGYL0", "B00004Y87O", "B0013D8LAE", "B00005JA8B", "B006ZL1P66", "B000GBEWRU", "B000IMUYJM", "B005J9ZFQG", "B001JFZ1UE", "B007STBUHI", "B000E8M0P6", "6305972001", "B00079Z9WI", "B00005A8XX", "B00009PY4G", "B000FAOC2W", "B000AA4JL6", "B0002C4JJ4", "B0002O7XW2", "B008JFUNYG", "B000HEWEGC", "B002LMSWN2", "B00BM4Q4H6", "B000HCO86I", "B008874968", "0783227434", "B0006SSOHC", "B001JFZ122", "B004LWZW24", "B000Q66Q8I", "B00001QGUM", "B000OYCMLM", "B000PMLJMQ", "B00000ILDD", "B00A1AU72A", "B004SIP9E2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00KDU8HQQ", "B00005LC4Q", "B000VKL6Z2", "B002YICNE2"]}, "price": 19.96, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 349265}, "asin": "6304697961", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51NXT68J3CL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Halloween"}

{"description": "Making this movie represented a rather risky venture for Mel Gibson--it was his first effort at directing, and the role demanded that he deliberately obscure his sexy matinee-idol looks. Gibson seems to truly relish his Lon Chaney Jr.-esque turn as Justin McLeod, a reclusive former teacher with half his face and body badly scarred, and a dark, secret past. The folks in McLeod's postcard-pretty Maine town have dubbed him \"Hamburger Head\" and exchange malicious gossip about him. But one boy is needy enough to dare to penetrate the fortress McLeod has built against the outside world. Fatherless Chuck Norstadt (Nick Stahl) is so anxious to escape his dysfunctional family that he pesters McLeod into becoming his mentor. Their relationship for the most part avoids the sort of sticky sentimentality one might expect from Hollywood. Chuck is a real, credible kid, a petulant pain with a chip on his shoulder, and McLeod is no Mr. Chips. It's fun, and quite moving, to watch these two cranky misfits battle their way toward a friendship that will change both their lives. Margaret Whitton (Major League) gives an unaffected performance as Chuck's narcissistic mother. \"I'm just not cut out for this mothering racket,\" she tells her rudderless children, as she flits from man to man. Gibson's own personal code of honor, we suspect, is very much in evidence in this movie's message: One must take responsibility for what one wants in life.--Laura Mirsky", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 450110}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6305012814", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5128XQKSB4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Man Without A Face [VHS]"}
{"description": "Basil Fawlty, as created and performed by John Cleese, is the rudest, most boorish, most hilariously obnoxious man on the face of the planet. What a natural for a TV sitcom! His screen wife, Sybil (Prunella Scales), put it best in the episode \"The Psychiatrist\": \"You're either crawling all over them, licking their boots, or spitting poison at them like some Benzedrine puff adder.\" He mockingly replies, \"Just trying to enjoy myself, dear.\" With his gangly frame and contortionist abilities, Cleese brilliantly punctuates Basil's outrageous faux pas with absurd gymnastics and turns Three Stooges-style pokes and kicks into a slapstick ballet. Scales's Sybil is the genial but obliviously chatty voice of reason and Andrew Sachs mangles the English language as the Spanish bellhop Manuel, whose struggles with simple directions results in comic lunacy reminiscent of Robert Benigni. After a six-episode run in 1975, Cleese and cowriter and costar Connie Booth (who plays Polly, the maid all too often pulled into Basil's ridiculous plans) reunited the cast in 1979 for another six episodes without missing a punch line. The four-volume collection contains all 12 shows, interspersed with interview segments featuring Cleese discussing the genesis of the series and anecdotes about the individual episodes.

{"description": "An economic crisis brings unemployed Nada (Roddy Piper) to L.A. in search of work.  What he finds instead is that the ruling elite of the world are aliens in disguise, their aim being to keep humans in a state of mindless consumerism.  His discovery comes when he dons a pair of special sunglasses made by a resistance group and sees for the first time reality unadorned.  Billboards, store signs, magazine covers--all bear subliminal messages to OBEY, to CONSUME, to have NO INDEPENDENT THOUGHT.  Money itself says THIS IS YOUR GOD. But worst of all, with these glasses you see which of us are really hideous, bug-eyed aliens.  The conceptual breakthrough is hilarious while keeping its roots in darker matters.  Although some fault the film for settling into its action plot, the ending has a great payoff. And the direction by John Carpenter is handled with superb workmanlike aplomb. One unforgettable set piece has Piper in a back-alley fistfight with a friend who won't put on the glasses that goes on and on, and just when you think it's over it goes another round. One of the most subversive films ever made in Hollywood,They Livewas released on the eve of the 1988 elections.  The first TV ads had two hideous alien politicians debating, then one accusing the other of being \"No John Kennedy!\"--Jim Gay", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00004Y87O", "B0002CHK1S", "B0000AOX0A", "B000AM6OQ2", "B000QUCQX8", "B005LS4MQY", "B0016I0AJG", "B00AKGG828", "B00AEFYDM2", "B008CYDD7I", "0783227434", "B000CNESU8", "B0002DB5PO", "B00023P4SS", "B000QQJ3Q0", "B00008974J", "0783225903", "0790731932", "B000A7Q1UQ", "B00FD81VQQ", "078062856X", "B00005K3O4", "B00005N5RM", "B0024FADD8", "B0024FAG44", "B000BR9S96", "B002E2QH7W", "0783241895", "B0053TWW36", "0783228457", "B000096FVG", "B002HML6YI", "B0053TWW9K", "B003O7I6L6", "B00AEFXR8I", "0767821629", "B00441GZ14", "B0045HCJKS", "B0001Z37HM", "6304936532", "0790729342", "B00005JOJE", "B0009X768W", "B0000AOX09", "B00006FDCD", "B000LC4Z7Q", "B00009YXHN", "B0000A08LF", "B0013LL2Z2", "B007XF0W3K", "B0010X73ZG", "B00005JL78", "B000059PP6", "B002NZK5SM", "B000FS9FCG", "B005FQ2H8W", "0792838300", "B000068IEV", "B00005PJ6M", "B000JMK6LW", "B003O7I6SE", "B00JQYV0B4", "B008DVJOQ4", "B0006210ZG", "B000UAFDR0", "B000PFUAP0", "B002NN7EY2", "0955997313", "B003UGLCIA", "B00005AVS9", "B000P0J0AQ", "B001J710Y8", "B000IJ7A5Q", "B00000JSJC", "B000OVLBHG", "B00000IREA", "6305645574", "B002I41KNC", "B00005N5S5", "B00005A3KS", "B0001FVDQ4", "B00CDV4RS0", "B0091C22AY", "B000P0J0BU", "B001PYD0PC", "6305065551", "B000MDFTHE", "B000WC3864", "157362408X", "B007FQXEXW", "B0007R4TR6", "B00008MTVY", "B0052DP1RC", "B00AEBB91E", "B00HZMZ2FE", "B005CVFZ66", "0800195175", "B001ECDVKE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0024FADBA", "B00004Y87O", "B000QUCQX8", "B0002CHK1S"]}, "price": 9.74, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 133661}, "asin": "6305077754", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51242QSSA4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "They Live"}
{"description": "The definitive American television series of the '90s comes to the big screen with an anticlimactic whimper. And how could it be otherwise? Why should material so perfectly realized in one medium necessarily translate well into another? The series is crisply and thoughtfully executed in just about every detail, but the heart of its appeal lies in the elegant handling of complicated and evolving ongoing story lines, which is not something movies are especially good at. The big-screen drive for closure cramps the creative style, though it may also help nonfans get a grip on the proceedings. We do get some invigorating thrills and chills, however, and a more satisfying sense of the scale of an all-enveloping human-alien conspiracy than ever before, but there's no more plot development here than in an average two-part season-ending. FBI black sheep Mulder and Scully have been temporarily transferred from the X-Files project to an anti-terrorist unit to investigate an Oklahoma City-style bombing. They uncover a new wrinkle in the Syndicate/Cancer Man conspiracy--basically an attempt to help one bunch of (benign?) aliens fight off another bunch who want to colonize Earth. A spectacular, ice-bound finale thrillingly staged by series-veteran director Rob Bowman offers Mulder (but not a conveniently unconscious Scully) his first clear look at a You Know What, which in some quarters qualifies as an epochal event. Martin Landau offers the agents some crucial clues, and several familiar TV faces (including the Lone Gunmen and Mitch Pileggi's indispensable Assistant Director Skinner) turn up briefly to wink knowingly at faithful fans.--David Chute", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B001FACH7S", "B001G7PSZI", "B000UZDO5I", "6303402348", "080010367X"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 338484}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.95, "brand": "20th Century Fox", "asin": "6305142467", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41GEJ8WNSKL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The X-Files (Movie) [VHS]"}

{"description": "Halloweenis one of the great modern horror films, but as a franchise its track record has been spotty at best, painfully bad at worst.Halloween H2O: Twenty Years Later, directed by horror vet Steve Miner (Friday the 13thparts 2 and 3,House), won't displace John Carpenter's original but it might help you forget the films in between. Miner certainly has: the film begins as if sequels 3 through 6 never happened. Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis, reprising her role for the first time in almost two decades) faked her death and is now a single mom and headmistress of an exclusive California private school. She's also a secret alcoholic who lives in fear of her homicidal brother-bogeyman Michael Myers. Guess who decides to show up for a family reunion? The film begins with classic horror-movie exposition (the deserted college campus, Michael's escape, Laurie's waking nightmares) accomplished with some humor and style, but it's all setup for the second half, a driving roller coaster of stalk-and-slash thrills. There's little of the self-conscious genre referencing ofScreamand at times the film is a little far-fetched--it is a slasher movie about a knife-wielding homicidal maniac who won't stay dead, after all--but Curtis transforms Laurie from a shrieking victim into an empowered, determined horror-movie heroine who's learned a thing or two from the previous films.

{"description": "Francis Ford Coppola was working as an assistant to Roger Corman when he made this, his feature debut.  The story goes that Corman let Coppola make the film so long as he could work around the shooting schedule of the film they were working on together, and the results are impressive given the budget constraints. Or maybebecauseof the budget constraints.  The story concerns the family at Castle Haloran, the secrets surrounding the death of young Kathleen, and an axe murderer who seems to be picking away at all present.  Coppola's deft direction keeps this from being a routine ghost story, using light and dark in his compositions to create tension and suspense.  The film has an interesting way of spanning the traditional ghost story and the more modern gore-fests that we're used to.  I have one bone to pick with the manufacturer of this disc: the transfer to DVD was made from tape.  This is evident from the way the frames roll repeatedly during the last 15 minutes of the film, and the tape bunches a few times leaving video artifacts. DVD consumers want all the benefits of this medium, and not to have the degraded quality of tape preserved on it.  If this is the only way you can get this film, at least the price is reasonable.

{"description": "Werner Herzog's remake of F.W. Murnau'soriginal vampire classicis at once a generous tribute to the great German director and a distinctly unique vision by one of cinema's most idiosyncratic filmmakers. Though Murnau'sNosferatuwas actually an unauthorized adaptation of Bram  Stoker'sDracula, Herzog based his film largely on Murnau's conceptions--at times directly quoting Murnau's images--but manages to slip in a few references to Tod Browning'sfamous version(at one point the vampire comments on the howling wolves: \"Listen, the children of the night make their music.\"). Longtime Herzog star Klaus Kinski is both hideous and melancholy as Nosferatu (renamed Count Dracula in the English language version). As in Murnau's film, he's a veritable gargoyle with his bald pate and sunken eyes, and his talon-like fingernails and two snaggly fangs give him a distinctly feral quality. But Kinski's haunting eyes also communicate a gloomy loneliness--the curse of his undead immortality--and his yearning for Lucy (Isabelle Adjani) becomes a melancholy desire for love. Bruno Ganz's sincere but foolish Jonathan is doomed to the vampire's will and his wife, Lucy, a holy innocent whose deathly pallor and nocturnal visions link her with the ghoulish Nosferatu, becomes the only hope against the monster's plague-like curse. Herzog's dreamy, delicate images and languid pacing create a stunningly beautiful film of otherworldly mood, a faithful reinterpretation that by the conclusion has been shaped into a quintessentially Herzog vision.--Sean Axmaker", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 272814}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "title": "Nosferatu the Vampyre [VHS]", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000056NW6", "6302783356", "B000VUQ4HW", "6304509154"], "also_viewed": ["6302194296", "B00EO2I6RO"]}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5123FXMFFAL._SY300_.jpg", "asin": "630526323X"}
{"description": "Meet Dr. Michael Hfuhruhurr (Steve Martin), the famous brain surgeon. Perhaps the name is not unfamiliar, though it is unpronounceable; the good doctor is the inventor of the celebrated \"screw-top\" method of brain surgery, in which the top of the skull twists off as easily as the lid of a pickle jar. The man may be a medical genius, but his talent for love leaves something to be desired, which explains his marriage to a gold-digging vixen (Kathleen Turner). Ah, but Dr. Hfuhruhurr may yet find true love, in the form of the disembodied brain he discovers in the lab of a mad scientist--David Warner, gone the Frankenstein route. (Lovely image:  Hfuhruhurr in a rowboat, taking the brain out for a romantic ride on the lake.) Thus, in its own utterly goofy way, doesThe Man with Two Brainsdelve into the eternal dilemma of male indecision:  does a man fall in love with a woman's body, or with her mind? Along the way, of course, there are gags both highbrow and very, very lowbrow, a mind-body split that might be why critics have tended to prefer the more sophisticated slapstick ofAll of Me(directed, like this film, by Carl Reiner) andRoxanneamong the early Steve Martin outings.

Masina's moon-faced and bright-eyed Cabiria is a passionate streetwalker with a heart as big as Italy and the emotional spontaneity of a child, a woman with a hearty passion for life whose constant weakness is falling in love with mercenary creeps. For a couple of hours we share the dreams and disillusionments of Cabiria as she rattles around Rome before once again losing her heart. The bittersweet heartbreak is tempered with a soaring celebration of the human spirit: no other Fellini film offers such honest hope in the face of such bitter devastation. Fellini left the poor and the working class to revel in the decadence of Rome's high society for his next film,La Dolce Vita, a film that could have sprung from Cabiria's hilarious chance interlude with a matinee idol (played by Amedeo Nazzari).

Mima is a singer who leaves her teeny-bop trio to become an actress in a violent television series, a career move that angers her fans, who prefer to see her as the pert, squeaky-clean pop idol. Plagued by self-doubt and tormented by humiliating compromises, she begins to be stalked, in her waking and sleeping moments, by an accusing alter ego who claims to be \"the real Mima,\" until she collapses into madness as her coworkers are brutally slain around her. Director Satoshi Kon, adapting the novel by Yoshikazu Takeuchi, shows us the world from her schizophrenic perspective: days blur, dreams cross over into the waking world, the TV show blends into her real life, until her life merges with her part and she can't separate the ghosts from the real-life stalkers. Though the pat ending sweeps the psychosis and anxiety away with nary an emotional scar, it remains a smart, stylish thriller and one of the most intelligent and compelling uses of animation in recent years. Though tame by the extreme standards of \"adult anime,\" there is nudity and a few sexually provocative scenes, and the animation is detailed and stylized (if somewhat stiff and jerky by Disney  standards).--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["6304123523", "6304198833", "6303104371", "B00441GYS8", "6303305520", "B00005JLET", "B00002JWYZ", "B00004REO0", "1603090428", "B00000JSIK"], "also_viewed": ["B0001EFTVA", "B000VWYJ5Y", "B004DMIIPA", "B0009RQS7I", "B00ENNA62W", "B0000AK80C", "B008XEZXYI", "B0011FNDV6", "6303305520"]}, "price": 64.88, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 757563}, "asin": "6305668353", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/519PESSKE0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Perfect Blue (rated edition) [VHS]"}

{"description": "\"I have a bad feeling about this,\" says the young Obi-Wan Kenobi  (played by Ewan McGregor) inStar Wars: Episode I, The Phantom  Menaceas he steps off a spaceship and into the most anticipated cinematic event... well, ever. He might as well be speaking for the  legions of fans of the original episodes in theStar Warssaga  who can't help but secretly ask themselves: Sure, this isStar  Wars, but is itmy Star Wars? The original elevated  moviegoers' expectations so high that it would have been impossible for  any subsequent film to meet them. And as with all theStar Warsmovies,The Phantom Menacefeatures inexplicable plot twists, a  fistful of loose threads, and some cheek-chewing dialogue. Han Solo's  swagger is sorely missed, as is the pervading menace of heavy-breathing  Darth Vader. There is still way too much quasi-mystical mumbo jumbo,  and some of what was fresh aboutStar Wars22 years earlier  feels formulaic. Yet there's much to admire. The special effects are  stupendous; three worlds are populated with a m&eacute;lange of creatures, flora, and horizons rendered in absolute  detail. The action and battle scenes are breathtaking in their  complexity. And one particular sequence of the film--the  adrenaline-infused pod race through the Tatooine desert--makes the chariot race inBen-Hurlook like a Sunday stroll through the park.Among the host of new characters, there are a few familiar walk-ons. We  witness the first meeting between R2-D2 and C-3PO, Jabba the Hutt looks  younger and slimmer (but not young and slim), and Yoda is as crabby as  ever. Natalie Portman's stately Queen Amidala sports hairdos that make  Princess Leia look dowdy and wields a mean laser. We never bond with  Jedi Knight Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson), and Obi-Wan's day is yet to come. Jar Jar Binks, a cross  between a Muppet, a frog, and a hippie, provides many of the movie's lighter moments, while Sith Lord Darth  Maul is a formidable force. Baby-faced Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd) looks too young  and innocent to command the powers of the Force or wield a lightsaber (much less transmute into the future Darth Vader), but his  boyish exuberance wins over skeptics.Near the end of the movie, Palpatine, the new leader of the Republic,  may be speaking for fans eagerly awaitingEpisode IIwhen he  pats young Anakin on the head and says, \"We will watch your career with  great interest.\" Indeed! --Tod Nelson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000633ZP", "6301792734", "B00005JLXH", "B00006HBUJ", "6304539258", "6304539274", "6301792769", "B000FQVX78", "6304539290", "0792158261", "B000FQJAJG", "6304117752", "0767729307", "B001GQSY5K", "6304178352", "B000FAGGWQ", "B00BBND56G", "B000FQJAIW", "B00005LL26", "B00003CXCT", "B00003CXI0", "B002I9Z8AS", "B00006AL1C", "B00CFWWDWE", "B000066HAS", "B000001ON6", "B000MUANT6", "6305587159"], "bought_together": ["B00005JLXH", "B00006HBUJ"], "also_viewed": ["B00006HBUJ", "B00005JLXH", "B00E9PMML2", "B0000633ZP", "6301792734", "B00BBND56G", "6304539258", "6301792769", "6304539274", "B00006JDUE", "0767729307", "B00E9PMMX0", "B000FQJAIW", "B000FQVX78", "B000FQJAJG", "B00000IQMT", "B000FAGGWQ", "B003ZSJ212", "0345434110", "6303148352", "6304089767", "0439834775", "6304117752", "B00BUZW14M", "6304500831", "0590010891", "0345341465", "6304434340", "B001GQSY5K", "155890641X", "B00005LL26", "6302961572", "0792151712", "B003W77SEO", "B000M4Y8JI", "0767825411", "B00003CXXI", "B00000IZ8A", "B00169IZN8", "6302787068", "B00006G8LB", "080010367X", "0800125762", "6302091632", "0792158261", "B000850IS6", "6300214826", "6303506291", "B00005V1Z8", "B000641D2Y", "0784011923", "B00008Y47S", "6300214060", "630382790X", "B00003CXI0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 79460}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.44, "brand": "Star Wars", "asin": "630575067X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41SJPKK4S4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Star Wars - Episode I, The Phantom Menace [VHS]"}

{"description": "Generally acknowledged as a bona fide classic, this Francis Ford Coppola film is one of those rare experiences that feels perfectly right from beginning to end--almost as if everyone involved had been born to participate in it. Based on Mario Puzo's bestselling novel about a Mafia dynasty, Coppola'sGodfatherextracted and enhanced the most universal themes of immigrant experience in America: the plotting-out of hopes and dreams for one's successors, the raising of children to carry on the good work, etc. In the midst of generational strife during the Vietnam years, the film somehow struck a chord with a nation fascinated by the metamorphosis of a rebellious son (Al Pacino) into the keeper of his father's dream. Marlon Brando played against Puzo's own conception of patriarch Vito Corleone, and time has certainly proven the actor correct. The rest of the cast, particularly James Caan, John Cazale, and Robert Duvall as the rest of Vito's male brood--all coping with how to take the mantle of responsibility from their father--is seamless and wonderful.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["630021639X", "6302158176", "6300183211", "6304214502", "6300214826", "0790705141", "6303168507", "0790733927", "B00003CXE6", "630470786X", "6300267997", "0790741512", "6303471501", "6300271331", "6302054982", "6303686796", "B00005PJ8I", "B00004COR2", "0792842111", "6304258984", "6304509146", "0783216084", "6300215644", "6300216500", "B000062XM6", "0800199421", "B0002F6BQU", "0800116917", "630336568X", "6304508611", "B00000F13T", "6304935811", "6305363668", "B000005PFL", "6300182878", "0792116887", "6300182452", "B00005B238", "0792845684", "6300247171", "0792839846", "6302482712", "6302989787", "0790732017", "0800100832", "630442972X", "6304196954", "B000065U6Q", "6301208773", "B00000K2SC", "6302842263", "6304429274", "6303313345", "B0000A36J1", "B000059XY5", "079212569X"], "bought_together": ["630021639X", "6302158176"], "also_viewed": ["6302610702", "630021639X", "6301792734", "6303402348", "6300215830", "6304117752", "6300183211", "6302158176", "B00COYZF5A", "6300214060", "B000NTPDSW", "6305095566", "0792151712", "6305169187", "6303953425", "080010367X", "6302054982", "6301208773", "B000KX0ISG", "630310696X", "6302415853", "6304214502", "B00005B238", "6303168507", "B00E9PMMX0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 270877}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.98, "brand": "", "asin": "B000003KHS", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/11KQ3QC757L.jpg", "title": "The Godfather [VHS]"}

{"description": "When Steven Spielberg was an adolescent, his first home movie was a backyard war film. When he toured Europe withDuelin his 20s, he saw old men crumble in front of headstones at Omaha Beach. That image became the opening scene ofSaving Private Ryan, his film of a mission following the D-day invasion that many have called the most realistic--and maybe the best--war film ever. With 1998 production standards, Spielberg has been able to create a stunning, unparalleled view of war as hell. We are at Omaha Beach as troops are slaughtered by Germans yet overcome the almost insurmountable odds.A stalwart Tom Hanks plays Captain Miller, a soldier's soldier, who takes a small band of troops behind enemy lines to retrieve a private whose three brothers have recently been killed in action. It's a public relations move for the Army, but it has historical precedent dating back to the Civil War. Some critics of the film have labeled the central characters stereotypes. If that is so, this movie gives stereotypes a good name: Tom Sizemore as the deft sergeant, Edward Burns as the hotheaded Private Reiben, Barry Pepper as the religious sniper, Adam Goldberg as the lone Jew, Vin Diesel as the oversize Private Caparzo, Giovanni Ribisi as the soulful medic, and Jeremy Davies, who as a meek corporal gives the film its most memorable performance.The movie is as heavy and realistic as Spielberg's Oscar-winningSchindler's List, but it's more kinetic. Spielberg and his ace technicians (the film won five Oscars: editing (Michael Kahn), cinematography (Janusz Kaminski), sound, sound effects, and directing) deliver battle sequences that wash over the eyes and hit the gut. The violence is extreme but never gratuitous.

{"description": "Not the egregious foul it seemed to be in theaters,Herculesstands up as an entertaining spritzer of an animated feature. The continual peppering of in-jokes and cultural references becomes less irksome on video. That there's no majesty or awe invested in the beloved Greek legends also seems less of an error. Also on the plus side is the bounciest Alan Menken music sinceLittle Shop of Horrors. With Zeus's blood in his veins, young Hercules's amazing strength makes him an outcast (sorry, that still doesn't fly), so he trains with a satyr named Phil to become a hero. Along the way Herc meets Meg, a common mortal who falls hard for him. They're both against the jocular Hades, who has to destroy Hercules to take over Olympus. The hydra is the computer-animated set piece for this little number, a no-chance attempt to beat that wildebeest herd fromThe Lion King.--Keith Simanton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000AAF1TU", "B00005TN8K", "B00AO686JC", "B0001I561E", "B0084IHVN4", "B000AAF1U4", "B00024I2Z4", "B00EV1YZ96", "B001ILFUD2", "B00005RDSQ", "B0084IHVGG", "B00CQRN3QI", "B0007KTBIU", "B00CTNYLQA", "B00335EQ0E", "B001FAFO3W", "B0034GK74G", "B00CUDD0C0", "B000YERP2S", "B00005JLR2", "B004ZBACOE", "B0013ND30M", "B00GDT5T9Y", "B003ZHVJGO", "B004G600A4", "B00007LVCM", "B0084IHVUC", "B00004R99F", "B00003CXCQ", "B0034JKZ86", "B003H9M1Q2", "B00003CXG7", "B001O5LVPI", "B00BG0RSJ4", "B00003CXB4", "B000B8QG4A", "B001ILFUDC", "B000VBJEEG", "B00005JMFH", "B0007PIDBQ", "B008YWY0HK", "B000ROAK2W", "B00003CX8Y", "B00000JGOQ", "B00AFEX83C", "B00009YXAW", "B0002YLCGK", "B0042U94UQ", "B0000VV4W2", "B003RACGZM", "B000GW8U1I", "B000056H26", "B00005T7H3", "B00E9ZATKI", "B00G5G7EXY", "B00E9ZATJO", "B00005JN4W", "B004GJYROG", "B0013FSL3E", "B0001I55W4", "B000035Z48", "B0030IIZ4M", "B008R65XPQ", "B0002YLCH4", "1570825181", "B00029LO0Y", "B0039N74CW", "0792839749", "B002BIGCXS", "B002WJI2QQ", "B00004R99H", "B001KVZ6FW", "B008JFUQ16", "B003L4Y5BW", "B0002YLCOM", "B000050MN3", "B00CNW9ZI6", "B00009M9BK", "B00CCXL9OE", "B0011U52E2", "0767810864", "B00009VU0J", "B00BWRKVVS", "B000FQISFS", "B00AO686E2", "B000089G5O", "B000B8QG3G", "B00EV1YZRI", "B00005JMQZ", "B004HO6I4M", "B00275EHJG", "B00005RRG7", "B00005JNS0", "B00004U9WQ", "B00JK531ES", "B0081VMY3G"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00JK531ES", "B00L4K450G", "B00LG6YEKE", "B00KHWSB5M"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 176967}, "asin": "B00001QEE2", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51XMAC4WSAL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Hercules (Limited Edition)"}

{"description": "As revisionist history, Michael Mann's intelligent docudramaThe Insideris a simmering brew of altered facts and dramatic license. In a broader perspective, however, the film (cowritten withForrest GumpOscar-winner Eric Roth) is effectively accurate as an engrossing study of ethics in the corruptible industries of tobacco and broadcast journalism. On one side, there is Jeffrey Wigand (Russell Crowe), the former tobacco scientist who violated contractual agreements to expose Brown & Williamson's inclusion of addictive ingredients in cigarettes, casting himself into a vortex of moral dilemma. On the other side is60&nbsp;Minutesproducer Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino), whose struggle to report Wigand's story puts him at odds with veteran correspondent Mike Wallace (Christopher Plummer) and senior executives at CBS News.As the urgency of the story increases, so does the film's palpable sense of paranoia, inviting favorable comparison toAll the President's Men. While Pacino downplays the theatrical excess that plagued him in previous roles, Crow is superb as a man who retains his tortured integrity at great personal cost.The Insideris two movies--a cover-up thriller and a drama about journalistic ethics--that combine to embrace the noble values personified by Wigand and Bergman. Even if the details aren't always precise (as Mike Wallace and others protested prior to the film's release), the film adheres to a higher truth that was so blatantly violated by tobacco executives seen in an oft-repeated video clip, lying under oath in the service of greed.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002DU39GW", "B00005BCKF", "0470499052", "0314277447", "B0002XNT12", "0314904573", "B0038Z5T4Q", "074945332X", "B00337KM2S", "B003L20IG0", "630542828X", "0205667503", "B001N44BVQ", "B000H0MKOC", "B000CNESTE", "B00121QGPY", "B00441GYPG", "B000FVQLQQ", "B00004YA78", "B0001HLVS2", "B00BTYOYG2", "B000CEXEWA", "B000P0J0AG", "B00005JKG9", "B00AEFXYJA", "B000085OXZ", "B00BB67UNW", "B0035JHYGQ", "B00003CXFV", "B00004Y7Y4", "B00005JLX2", "B00AEBB95K", "B000XR9L50", "B000LXHK2C", "B000CNESU8", "B00441GYOM", "B00003CWUX", "B00A2H9VKG", "B002VWNICC", "B001AS32QK", "B000059TFO", "0780622561", "B002CPMB9O", "B0000296JH", "007337959X", "B000ARTN3I", "B002O3Z4WU", "B004SIP6C2", "B0000AM6JI", "B000OYAT3U", "B005FITIGO", "B00005JKMQ", "B0034G4P7G", "0792838947", "B00008CMRK", "B00003CXP7", "B000CQLZ8S", "B00004Z1FL", "B0001907AI", "B004SUDQ1S", "B00CLH0848", "0767817710", "B00007G1YQ", "B00008R9KG", "B000C3L2IO", "B0031OCY2E", "B00127RAGC", "B003U0AHBO", "B00JBGSHSQ", "B004IFYMWK", "B00004XPPB", "B0009OUBC4", "B004U7MR1Y", "B00008BNTD", "B001EJW0SG", "0783226845", "B003LR5BD0", "6304696507", "B0001I56FA", "B00DDY45DI", "B00GUO2SKA", "B0000YEEGM", "B000HT38IK", "B00006RCNV", "B000UGBOT0", "B000A9QK5K", "B000A9QK6E", "B00IJS2OHM", "B006DHATE6", "B0002J4X2K", "B000MXPE7O", "B004SIP7TE", "6305428115", "B00BLF9FYA", "B00AEBB9EG", "B0036TGSR6", "0783229402", "B00005BCK9", "B00004RE27"], "bought_together": ["B002DU39GW", "B003L20IG0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002DU39GW", "B000Y11B8U", "B003L20IG0", "B00005JN2Z"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 17334}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.75, "brand": "Disney", "asin": "B00003CWRX", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Y28RGA5AL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Insider"}

Tolkien's classicThe Lord of the Rings,  but this robust adaptation maintains reverent allegiance to Tolkien's creation,  instantly qualifying as one of the greatest fantasy films ever made. At 178  minutes, it's long enough to establish the myriad inhabitants of Middle-earth,  the legendary Rings of Power, and the fellowship of hobbits, elves, dwarves, and  humans--led by the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and the brave hobbit Frodo  (Elijah Wood)--who must battle terrifying forces of evil on their perilous  journey to destroy the One Ring in the land of Mordor. Superbly paced, the film  is both epic and intimate, offering astonishing special effects and production  design while emphasizing the emotional intensity of Frodo's adventure. Ending on  a perfect note of heroic loyalty and rich anticipation, this wondrous fantasy  continues inThe Two Towers(2002).--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JKZV", "B00005JKZY", "B00BEZTMFY", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B005COPWZW", "B00005JM5E", "B002ZG980U", "B002PMV9FG", "B001GZ6QC4", "B007K3JFUQ", "B000U7WV1Y", "B00005JNJV", "B001OQCV6A", "B004M1A21K", "B008UZ7MYY", "B00HFFE8HE", "B000A9QKLO", "B000E8M0VA", "B000W7F5SS", "B0014C2FX8", "0618640150", "B001DHXT20", "B00E5I2M6I", "B00003CX5P", "B0013FDM7E", "B00AZMFJYA", "B00005QZWI", "B0019L770A", "B000I0RQVI", "B002IPFWTE", "B001CDR1FG", "B0006UEVT0", "B003TT2X6S", "B001OQCV2E", "B009JBWOU0", "B00005JL78", "B00005JNOG", "B001UV4XHY", "B00CNW9ZI6", "B00GKOJ98E", "0345325818", "B0014Z4ON4", "B000H30B2C", "B005LXQLRW", "B001UV4XIS", "B001GCUO1Q", "B00CZDLGDU", "0345538374", "B004LWZW42", "B007REV4T8", "B000W746GK", "B00005JPH2", "B003TT2X72", "B004LWZWGA", "B0087ZG7J8", "B005G4TJUC", "B003ZK99NQ", "B00006HBUJ", "B008UZA8FY", "B0090SI56Y", "B000VI70QS", "B00005JNC2", "B004WCTLNY", "B0014Z4OMU", "6305313687", "B004AKCME8", "B000E6EK2Y", "0547928211", "B000LC55F2", "B0002KVUKM", "B000FQJAIW", "B008JFUO72", "B000FIMG68", "B005LAIHSG", "B005LAIIT4", "B004AOECXI", "B00029RTCG", "B000P0J0EM", "B002HWRYJE", "B0060FXDCG", "B001ECQ75A", "0792839749", "B00AEFXZJE", "B005LAII0I", "B0042U94UQ", "B001HN6918", "B00008G8M5", "B008JFURII", "B003ZKBELG", "B000P0J09W", "B003XURDAY", "B00335EQ0E", "B00008G8M4", "0547928203", "B000W796OM", "B00006ADD5", "B00J49R1BY", "B00B04NIZO", "B00G5G7EXY", "B00001ZWUS"], "bought_together": ["B00005JKZV", "B00005JKZY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00HFFE8HE", "B00005JKZY", "B00BEZTMFY", "B00005JKZV"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 3641}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.49, "brand": "NEW Line Home Video", "asin": "B00003CWT6", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Dj%2BQ1hLBL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)"}
{"description": "Schizoid serial killer Carl Stargher (Vincent D'Onofrio) has  been captured at last, but a neurological seizure has rendered him  comatose, and FBI agent Peter Novak (Vince Vaughan) has no way to  determine the location of Stargher's latest and still-living victim. To  probe the secrets contained in Stargher's traumatized psyche, the FBI  recruits psychologist Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez), who has  mastered a new technology that allows her to enter the mind of another person. What she finds in Stargher's head is a  theater of the grotesque, which, as envisioned by first-time director  Tarsem Singh, is a smorgasbord of the surreal that borrows liberally  from the Brothers Quay, Czech animator Jan Svankmajer, Hieronymous  Bosch, Salvador Dali, and a surplus of other cannibalized sources.This provides one of the wildest, weirdest visual feasts ever committed  to film, andThe Cellearns a place among such movie mind-trips  as2001: A Space Odyssey,Altered States,What Dreams  May Come, andUn Chien Andalou.

{"description": "The Replacementsmanages to be both completely formulaic and yet immensely enjoyable. When a professional football players' strike happens, the owner of a fictitious team, the Washington Sentinels, commissions maverick coach Jimmy McGinty (Gene Hackman) to pull together a team. McGinty selects a collection of talented oddballs--a Welsh soccer player, a sumo wrestler, a couple of professional bodyguards--with athletic pasts, figuring that if it doesn't work out as a game, it might as well be a circus. To lead the team, he finds Shane Falco (Keanu Reeves), a once-promising player who had a disastrous championship game. Naturally, despite squabbling and bickering, a roguish camaraderie develops through a mixture of racial infighting, harassment from the striking professionals, and a big bar brawl--after which they're all thrown in jail and perform the most improbable impromptu dance number ever committed to film. The mixture of cheerfully clich&eacute; plot mechanics, an engaging collection of supporting actors (including Orlando Jones, Rhys Ifans fromNotting Hill, and Jon Favreau fromSwingers), and sheer ridiculousness somehow combines to makeThe Replacementscompletely entertaining. Reeves is somehow turning into a pleasant leading man; he even emotes convincingly in this movie. And let's face it, Gene Hackman is quite possibly the greatest actor alive, able to speak the trashiest dialogue with fierce conviction. Plus, just to prove that the tight pants and close huddles of football are heterosexual, there are many, many shots of cheerleaders going through stripper-inspired routines.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00E1HIXFW", "B002NZK5QO", "6305428492", "B000J3OTT6", "B000056VP4", "B00AEFYJI0", "B00AEFYKWU", "B000FOPPDI", "B000NTMA0Q", "B0006GANOQ", "B000F6ZIIS", "B00005JPBO", "B00AEBB9UU", "B00005JNEW", "B000A0GP0Y", "B00005JKE4", "B00E8G5HZ0", "B000KHYN9C", "0792843592", "B001SGEUYW", "B00004W221", "B00AEFXJY0", "B002GIBVWA", "B000FVR1T2", "B001Q8MMBK", "B002VECM6S", "0780627849", "B00BTYNXJG", "B0009MDPYM", "630529142X", "B00005QW6W", "B00003CXND", "B004OBQDHK", "B004KPLVX6", "B002K0WBXW", "B000HEWEE4", "B00014NEZI", "B00005M20J", "0800177258", "B001BP4K22", "0767802454", "6305428530", "B004GJYRF0", "B00005JL93", "B000053VAX", "B00000F4ZY", "B000CCBCAI", "B0000B1OFL", "B00026ZD04", "6304712499", "6305428077", "B00000G3PA", "B000GAKDAG", "0767817710", "B00DW5IL92", "B002U4UYYQ", "6304711891", "B000U1ZV8A", "B00008L3W3", "6305213283", "0783228465", "B003AWRMBA", "B00FEHCQEC", "B008R65XTC", "B004BFTFBU", "B0047685IC", "0767817729", "B000QUCRB4", "B0026BXHPG", "B00000JGPE", "6305428387", "B0007DAGZ4", "B004KPLVWM", "6305428115", "B00AEBB86A", "6304806434", "6305262128", "078324021X", "B0000524E5", "6305065551", "B0006GAI5U", "B0001US66Y", "0767821513", "B0009X76ZK", "B000EXZFCQ", "B002GOAH1A", "B00AEFYDM2", "B00007E2F5", "B000A343RI", "B00AEFYIH2", "6305133468", "B00AEBB86U", "0783225741", "B000069HQ2", "B00005A3KS", "B002AT8KD8", "B000YGGNMO", "B007STBUHI", "B000089778", "B000ELJAEM"], "bought_together": ["B00E1HIXFW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00B83N2NU", "B000MNOX94", "B00005JKE4", "0790749912"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 62076}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.99, "brand": "Team Marketing", "asin": "B00003CXLV", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/513B1VE3PSL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Replacements (Snap Case)"}

{"description": "Many Hollywood directors should follow Rod Lurie's lead and invite their stars to do the DVD commentary. Oscar nominee Joan Allan joins Lurie, turning the commentary track into an enjoyable conversation. It tends to be a lovefest at times but does give insight into the relationship between a lead actor and director during filmmaking. Over the end credits, Lurie mentions the brouhaha that actor (and producer) Gary Oldman started when he made discouraging comments about the film's final cut. It's interesting to note none of Oldman's work ends up in the dozen deleted scenes shown on the DVD. The scenes have much more meat on the bone than most and illustrate some curious character development. The half-hour making-of featurette has the standard press-kit materials but also gives us a good background on the history of political thrillers.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783227973", "B0060ZJ7DA", "0780622561", "B001ECDVK4", "B0043X1FNQ", "B000CEXEWA", "B004IFYMWK", "B00AEFYTMQ", "B00003CWRX", "6304696507", "B00AEFYUQQ", "6305297142", "B003ASLJIQ", "B00005JNP4", "B0001V6ZJI", "B001ECDVJU", "B0059XTTW8", "0783116934", "B0013XZ2QK", "B000067IZ3", "B00005BCK9", "B00000K3TU", "0792159659", "B00005UM2X", "B000C65Z1G", "B00441GYTC", "6305428522", "B00003CXQG", "630542828X", "B002NZK5UU", "6305310335", "B00000IQC0", "B002EAYE42", "B00005OOQ2", "B002ZG993Q", "B004SIP6C2", "B005FITIGO", "B0043X1FKY", "B00004RF83", "0767802519", "B00006ZXSN", "0783229402", "B006ML50QK", "B00003CXPV", "0800141806", "B00DW5IK9S", "B000BYRCQU", "B00006L92U", "B000CQLZ8S", "B00008K76V", "B00AEBB8LA", "B000Y11B8U", "0767803434", "B007KAUWO2", "6304696515", "B003Y5H4R0", "B0000542C5", "B0011V7PSC", "B00GUO2SKA", "B00G7QQ3AC", "0790730979", "B00AEFXUXU", "B001PR0Y8K", "B00000K3CS", "B00015YVDG", "1558908382", "B00AEFXYJA", "B00008K76U", "B002DU39GW", "0792845811", "B004SIP7F8", "B000056HEA", "B0039UT3LK", "B0007IO6NM", "B00JA3RVG4", "B00G7QPXUI", "B00004XPPB", "B00005BCKF", "0764585533", "B00GMV8M2Y", "B0000SXK0E", "B000063US3", "B004FQX59I", "B00008K7AO", "B00AEFYIH2", "B00003CXFV", "B001GLX6UI", "B00006RCNY", "B0045HCJJ4", "B00BTYRB58", "6305428115", "B001AMHNKW", "B0012EBV6A", "0767811100", "B0060ZJ7AI", "B0009GX1CE", "B000HT38IK", "B00004ZBVO", "B00005ATZT"], "bought_together": ["0783227973", "0780622561"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0064470393", "0783227973"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 40208}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 13.99, "brand": "", "asin": "B00003CXP7", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/411PCH1X0RL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Contender"}

{"description": "To callPearl Harbora throwback to old-time war movies is something of an understatement. Director Michael Bay's epic take on the bombing that brought the United States into World War II hijacks every war movie situation and clich&#xE9; (some affectionate, some stale) you've ever seen and gives them a shiny, glossy spin until the whole movie practically gleams. Planes glisten, water sparkles, trees beckon--and Bay's re-creation of the bombing itself, a 30-minute sequence that's tightly choreographed and amazingly photographed, sets the action movie bar up quite a few notches. And in updating the classic war film, Bay and screenwriter Randall Wallace (Braveheart) use that old plot standby, the love triangle--this time, it's between two pilots (Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett) and a nurse (Kate Beckinsale) who find themselves stationed at Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, during what they thought would be a nice, sunny tour of duty. Then, of course, history intervened.For the first 90 minutes of the movie, Affleck and Beckinsale find a nice, appealing chemistry that plays on his strengths as a movie star and hers as a serious actress--he gives her glamour, she gives him smarts. Their truncated romance--the beginning of which is told in flashback so we can get right to the point where he has to leave her to go to England--works, thanks to their charm. They're no Kate and Leo fromTitanic(a strategy the film strives hard toward), but they're pretty darn adorable in their own right. Hartnett, as the not entirely unwelcome third wheel, squints bravely but makes only a slight dent in the film. Everyone else inPearl Harbor--from Cuba Gooding Jr.'s brave navy seaman to Jon Voight's able impersonation of FDR--is pretty much a glorified walk-on, taking a backseat to the pyrotechnics and action sequences that keep the three-hour film in fairly constant motion. But when that action does take hold,Pearl Harboris quite a thrilling ride.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792151712", "B000059HGY", "B00000K3AN", "B00AEBBA36", "0792133153", "079212569X", "6305169187", "6301734734", "0792147618", "0792116887", "6304618344", "079213690X", "6303269834", "6304925131", "6305718792", "6304259131", "B00004WIDB", "6304935811", "6303057225", "6304143184", "6302250269"], "bought_together": ["B00000K3AN", "B00AEBBA36"], "also_viewed": ["B00000G3PA", "0792151712", "6300213668", "B00000JS61", "6303215734", "6303402348", "B00004WIDB", "079213690X", "6305750750", "B004751DFU", "B00005O893", "B00000K3AN", "6301792734", "B00E5I2MCM", "6305169187", "B00007LVCM", "B007SPPANM", "B00L4K3MLE", "B00FLML7HW", "B008QZ5PY2", "B00JBGWP3Y"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 234413}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.49, "brand": "", "asin": "B00003CXTF", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HC1ZDJN6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]"}
{"description": "LikeSaving Private Ryan,Enemy at the Gatesopens with a  pivotal event of World War II--the German invasion of  Stalingrad--re-created in epic scale, as ill-trained Russian soldiers  face German attack or punitive execution if they flee from the enemy's  advance. Director Jean-Jacques Annaud captures this madness with urgent  authenticity, creating a massive context for a more intimate battle  waged amid the city's ruins. Embellished from its basis in fact, the  story shifts to an intense cat-and-mouse game between a Russian shepherd  raised to iconic fame and a German marksman whose skill is unmatched in  its lethal precision. Vassily Zaitzev (Jude Law) has been sniping Nazis  one bullet at a time, while the German Major Konig (Ed Harris) has been  assigned to kill Vassily and spare Hitler from further embarrassment.There's love in war as Vassily connects with a woman soldier (Rachel  Weisz), but she is also loved by Danilov (Joseph Fiennes), the Soviet  officer who promotes his friend Vassily as Russia's much-needed hero.  This romantic rivalry lends marginal interest to the central plot, but  it's not enough to make this a classic war film. Instead it's a taut,  well-made suspense thriller isolated within an epic battle, and although  Annaud and cowriter Alain Godard (drawing from William Craig's book and  David L.

{"description": "A promising comedy that goes awry all too early,But I'm a Cheerleaderconcerns a misunderstood high school kid (Natasha Lyonne) whose parents send her to a harsh, homosexual-rehabilitation camp despite a lack of evidence that she's gay. Ruled with an iron fist by a fascist counselor (Cathy Moriarty), the clinic only drives Lyonne's character toward an attraction to a rebellious tomboy (Clea DuVall), though screenwriter Brian Wayne Peterson and director Jamie Babbit are curiously intent on keeping the two apart and depriving the audience of other comic possibilities. Meanwhile, hoary clich&eacute;s abound: prancing boys, butch gays, lipstick lesbians. Despite a fine cast full of young talent, and cameo appearances by Julie Delpy and RuPaul Charles, this attempt to skewer a present-day trend in \"curing\" homosexuals of their sexual preferences is flattened by stereotypes and unimaginative thinking.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00002CGGH", "B0001HAGSI", "B000F7CEBG", "B00005QW5T", "B0009298MU", "B00004U104", "B00000I6D4", "B000J4QWIG", "B00023P4M4", "B00006RJ97", "B002SF9YTS", "B00003CYJ4", "B001AJIWQE", "B000AQOHN0", "B00827OWO8", "B008XAGN46", "B00GPPXNIK", "B00AFDN5Y0", "B000062Y1E", "B00011Y1QC", "B000A4T804", "B004BJMEO6", "B000SUKPL6", "B000OVLC0W", "B00004YKR3", "B00441GYVK", "B00003CWN3", "B004N21KIC", "B005Q4CLKW", "B00FKPJ3VM", "B00004STHG", "B000F3UA6Q", "B003YYVSEG", "B00DW5IKYS", "B00CLH0APA", "B0038M61IC", "B000GTJSO4", "0780628306", "B00441GYVA", "B00003CWQR", "B007PXYWBI", "B0002OXRSG", "B005OTQIK8", "B000067D0Y", "B005S9EIGU", "B004EI2NM2", "B0000714BP", "B00005ASPE", "B004AHAEV4", "B00JVLGL7U", "B001Y7CVXC", "B007OXB1H2", "B008XAT0VE", "B004SIP86Q", "B0009QTRVI", "B0002KPIQY", "B004AYMY92", "B000O76ZO4", "B00CBG9SQS", "0316009857", "B003M05KUA", "B00C1LIZEE", "B0085E44W8", "B00005J761", "B00009MEC4", "B004CWLRF4", "B00BDTSLEO", "B00005UJYC", "B0000560PU", "B00435KP44", "B003L20ICE", "B00125WAWI", "0374400113", "6305821216", "B0053TWVQ4", "B00005NRNS", "B005JZBPHS", "B00HW3EXCE", "B000BZISX0", "1575423634", "B000F3UA70", "B00005JKJS", "055327886X", "6305428425", "B007C95S9K", "B00H3RT7M0", "B0037QGS0A", "0792843983", "B000AM6OVW", "B000ETRCMQ", "B0002MPQRS", "B000FDEE86", "B00EMAGCHE", "0062020579", "B00ANGIC4W", "B00AG474YU", "B00005OLBC", "B00CMQIDKY", "0767837398", "B001EHDSPM"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00GPPXNIK", "B000F7CEBG", "B00002CGGH", "B00827OWO8"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 189241}, "asin": "B00004X13Q", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DTW1ATQYL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "But I'm A Cheerleader"}
{"description": "Don't Tell Mom The Babysitter's Deadaspires to be a cross  betweenHome AloneandRisky Business, with Christina Applegate as an inadvertent scam artist who gets in over her head and somehow pulls it off. When her mother goes to Australia for two months, Sue Ellen (Applegate) thinks she's going to be in charge--until an elderly tyrant of a babysitter arrives. But on the very first night the old lady has a heart attack and keels over. Sue Ellen and her siblings leave the body at a mortuary, only to discover afterward that all the money their mother had left for the summer was in the babysitter's clothes. So Sue Ellen has to get a job. Thanks to a trumped-up resume, she ends up as an executive assistant at a clothing manufacturer. For a while she keeps her head above water by skillfully exploiting a friendly coworker, but her brothers and sisters are running amok at home and a venomous receptionist has it in for her at work. The role-reversal humor of Sue Ellen having to mother her siblings is unsurprising, but Applegate is unexpectedly appealing; her scenes with Josh Charles (Dead Poet's Society,Threesome) have a sweet chemistry. Joanna Cassidy (Blade Runner,The Laughing Policeman) plays Sue Ellen's boss and a young David Duchovny (The X-Files,The Rapture) is a weaselly clerk.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305428050", "B0000897DW", "6305433925", "B00094ARJ6", "B00002SSKI", "B00DW5IL92", "B000065V3H", "B0001AW14C", "B00AEFXPG2", "B005QX8UEE", "B0001EFTSS", "B0012RWQJ8", "B00013WWT8", "6305428549", "B00015YVD6", "B00AEBB9DW", "B000A0GXF6", "B0053TWVR8", "6305428425", "6305236569", "B000065V42", "B000PMFS0A", "B000089778", "B0006J28MI", "B001BPVB5G", "B004RA7YU8", "B000089771", "B000HD1482", "B0000WN0UU", "0783225482", "B00008L3VZ", "B005LL817W", "B00008L3T3", "B002GOAH10", "B00005QT9P", "B00AEBB9E6", "B0045HCJRG", "B001AEF6BS", "B005OK0YVG", "B000BYA4JM", "B00D2UMHVK", "B0000542C7", "B000068TPB", "B00AEFXO8Q", "0800177991", "B000P0J0A6", "B000068MC1", "B000Y11B7Q", "0783227388", "B0001I562I", "B00AEFXXMI", "B000K7VHTQ", "B00005PJ6N", "B0080BFWAE", "B001AEF6C2", "B0000C3I99", "B000P0J09W", "B000260NTK", "B003156II4", "B00008L3W3", "B008R65XTC", "B00008977A", "B00009PY3X", "B001CK1D44", "B001AGXEAG", "B000VDDDW8", "B00008978R", "B00BTYSIWI", "B00008979O", "B00AG473GE", "B00AEBB91E", "B000QQLVPQ", "B0053TWVQ4", "B002GHHHOM", "B000059H76", "B001LMAK9C", "B003ASXMTA", "B00005QCVN", "B000065V43", "B001MWUWU8", "0783225504", "B000068QPT", "B00AGKHBQK", "B00447L4KA", "B00005T7I1", "B00029RTCG", "B00005JLFA", "B0064SVO9I", "B000FFJYBG", "B00AMDA2O4", "B00008G7UG", "0767821637", "B00007AJE1", "B00441GYVK", "B00079Z9Y6", "B00005JG6M", "B000RW3VCU", "B00006JMQ3", "B002JOUNE8", "B00AEBB9IM"], "buy_after_viewing": ["6305428050", "B00002SSKI", "B00DW5IL92", "B00AEBB9E6"]}, "price": 4.27, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 168827}, "asin": "B00004XMVA", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51qgH7FV6BL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Don't Tell Mom The Babysitter's Dead"}

{"description": "When it was first broadcast in 1975, there had never been a more lavishly produced science fiction TV series thanSpace: 1999, a British production whose budget for the first of its two seasons ran an astounding 3.25 million pounds. What keeps us fans enthralled after all these years has only partly to due with the first-rate production values, the plausibly constructed spaceship models, and expert special effects. The tone of the show is one of scientific dispassion, setting it apart from its TV sci-fi predecessors such asStar Trek, whose mood was more convivial. Our heroes here are in dire circumstances that require cool heads as a survival trait. Those circumstances: the 311 crew members of Moonbase Alpha experience a cataclysm that causes the moon to break away from Earth's orbit and travel endlessly through space, turning our heroes into unintentional explorers.

{"description": "Kurt Russell and Mariel Hemingway star in this well-above-average thriller.Mean Seasonoffers plenty of suspense as well as an interesting take on the role of the press in sustaining the very violence it covers. Russell plays Malcolm Anderson, a burned-out journalist who never got the big career-making story he always wanted. Just as he's about to give up and move to the idyllic countryside, the big story comes to him--in the form of a serial killer with a fixation for Anderson himself. As Anderson's fame grows, he starts getting hounded by his brethren, the press. Add this to the assorted problems that go along with having a serial killer a little too interested in one's personal life, and you've got major trouble. Director Phillip Borsos does a nice job of conveying information through quick visuals, and even sets up some moments of eerie beauty, such as the shot of a victim's apartment, covered in a snowfall of pillow feathers. More importantly, Borsos knows he's making a thriller and makes sure to have fun doing it: there are plenty of loooooong shadows and a few good jolts along the way. As Anderson's girlfriend, Mariel Hemingway is essentially asked to play bait, but manages to flesh out what could easily have been a cardboard character.--Ali Davis", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0043X1FNQ", "B00008CMRK", "B002NZK5RI", "B000HC2LHG", "6305310335", "B00CPTUOI2", "B00005UEQX", "B002O3Z4WK", "B00005JKTP", "B00I4X8KU2", "B0009GX1CE", "B00AEFY0KW", "B000GNOSDG", "B00BTYRB58", "B00008L3UQ", "B00HRISNPM", "0790730979", "B00049QJ9I", "B00AEFYD9K", "B00005K3NU", "B00HVOFP9O", "B00000K0DR", "B00097DY2A", "0792844874", "B00I01FW90", "6305161895", "B00AEFXKZ8", "B000MMMTCS", "B000BKDNVM", "0689114044", "0767821610", "B00GICP84W", "B00DW5IK9S", "B00G5GNZ78", "B00AEBBA4K", "B00AEFYC96", "B004GJYRK0", "0783226993", "B001PYD0PC", "B00441GYOM", "B0030ATZI0", "B00005Y1UV", "B000059XTK", "B00AEFXR8I", "B00AEBB8O2", "B00AEFYDM2", "B00H96KFO4", "B005KQVE1S", "B0002J58HO", "B002NZK5UU", "B0002CHK1S", "B00066FB52", "B0002IQLHQ", "B000HWZ4D4", "B00004Y87O", "B000ETRA5U", "B00013RC66", "B0007WQGS6", "B001KVZ6LQ", "6305213305", "B00AEFYW64", "B001VFM0Z6", "B00E8G5GU6", "B0077HQCYM", "B000EHSVNW", "B0000ALPFL", "B002NZK5R8", "B0002CR03G", "B000UAE7J0", "B00008EY9G", "B000O78KWE", "B00023P4UQ", "6305262128", "B00E9PMMPI", "B00AEFXJF4", "B0000TG95Q", "B008FYZIZK", "B002T4GWYI", "B0000JBALO", "B0042FUHUM", "B00AEBBA7W", "B00AEFYSR2", "B001ILTUL0", "B00008438U", "B00008RV0G", "B00AEBB95K", "B004XIWRW4", "6304696558", "B000CCW2TS", "B00005NVDG", "6305428522", "B00441GYYC", "B00AEBB8BU", "B00AEFYSWM", "B009IV2Z3M", "B00DPUB56U", "B007RUZ29A", "B008H6GHG0", "6305262268", "B004SIP9Z6"], "bought_together": ["B0043X1FNQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0783223609", "6305222886"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 43092}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 27.74, "brand": "", "asin": "B000059TGB", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51989FX4SZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Mean Season"}

{"description": "It's a mixed blessing, but Claude Chabrol's 1991 adaptation ofMadame Bovarycan at least claim a proper French pedigree in its fidelity to Flaubert's literary classic. It's certainly more faithful than Madame herself, played here with icy determination by Isabelle Huppert. Frustrated, repressed, and desperate for any opportunity to break free of her numbing marital bondage, the wife of Dr. Bovary finds her chance in the affections of Rodolphe Boulanger (Christophe Malavoy), but she is too shallow and too selfish to sense his lack of commitment. And as Flaubert's tale unfolds (along with Chabrol's dryly accurate interpretation), Emma Bovary finds herself caught in a snare of her own design. This tragedy of self-absorption--a universal study of indulgence, ignominy, and fatal discontent--should prove potent for anyone who feels the oppression of an unhappy marriage, but it's also a compelling study of boredom as an internal phenomenon. Huppert conveys exasperation, passion, and self-destruction in equal measure, yet she barely alters her passive, blank expression; her performance is too cold to ignite the resonant themes of Flaubert's novel. All in all, one wonders if Chabrol--seemingly uneasy with costume drama--is being too respectful of Flaubert at the cost of his own directorial mastery. This is a prestigious and worthwhile adaptation, but like one of Dr. Bovary's patients, it's been bled to the point of paleness and fainting. The result is a literate film that's \"good for you,\" even though it may not be entirely good.--Jeff Shannon", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 828127}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.43, "brand": "", "asin": "B000059ZXA", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZME82WP8L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Madame Bovary (Amazon.com Exclusive) [VHS]"}

A rebel with a cause, Godard pursues an iconoclast's agenda, using the Franscope format (expertly controlled by cinematographer Raoul Coutard) to undermine the grandeur of widescreen melodramas. The story ostensibly concerns an innovative production of Homer'sOdysseyand the struggle of a respected screenwriter (Michel Piccoli) to please a pugnacious producer (Jack Palance), a veteran director (Fritz Lang, essentially playing himself), and a petulant wife (Brigitte Bardot) who's grown tired of their turbulent relationship. It's all pretense, however, for Godard's mischievous (and yes, contemptuous) deconstruction of commercial Hollywood filmmaking, potently infused with film-buff in-jokes, astute observations about love, stardom, and artistry, and enough glossy style to suggest that Godard had mastered the craft he so willfully rejects.Contemptis one of his most accessibly fascinating films.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000ZM1MIM", "0780021541", "B00007CVS2", "B000A88ERS", "B00005NC66", "B0001ZIYDO", "B00005BHW6", "B008Y5OVZ8", "B00004Z1FM", "0780023110", "B0007989Y8", "B00GRA7M2G", "B000093NR0", "B0035ECHVI", "B0026VBOJW", "B00HVOFP08", "B00000IOKV", "B000QUEQ40", "6305257450", "B000YV1Q30", "B000E5LEV0", "B00005QAPJ", "B0007989ZC", "B003VA3JTA", "B001TIQT6Q", "B000E5LEVA", "B000AQKUG8", "B0000633SC", "B00008H2GR", "0780020707", "B00K5EJHGO", "B0009298N4", "B00005A8TV", "B0007SMDCS", "B00DZP1BUU", "0780022343", "B00005A8TU", "B000BC8SWO", "B00GPPXOTS", "B00J2PQZRQ", "B00005B1ZK", "0780022629", "B00HVOFP9O", "B000N2HBIO", "6305744114", "B005HK13S6", "B000BC8SWE", "B005MXQD74", "B00005QAPH", "B00005JKGO", "B0000BUZKP", "B0000WN0ZK", "B0000A02TX", "B00005UQ7T", "B005BZLP8K", "B00008RH15", "B008CJ0JS4", "B001CW7ZSA", "B00HVOFP6W", "B004ALIG1U", "B00180R05O", "B00152VXU8", "B008Y5OW70", "B00008H2GS", "B000HT3QBE", "B00014K5Y6", "B00HRJVHEK", "B00152VXUI", "B0000YEEHG", "B000025RE7", "B00005V6N6", "B0035ECI0I", "B001LMU1C8", "B0046ZYEVG", "B000I8OOG0", "B000KGH0ES", "B00DHN8GGW", "B000059H7Q", "B00092ZLEY", "B004NWPY20", "B00ATK02FO", "B0013D8LY0", "B00005NC68", "B005VU9LI6", "B003D3Y64C", "B0006Z2NAO", "B00005EBSF", "B0002KPHZG", "6305131104", "B0019X400I", "B000FUF7CQ", "B000PKG6OY", "B00HE011DE", "B0002JP2OS", "B00079ZA6S", "B0000AINJ8", "B00EO2I6W4", "B00IGK6TGU", "B000BB14I0", "B00DHN8G3U"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000QUEQ40", "B005BZLP8K", "B00005BHW6", "B002NTDXOG"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 37399}, "asin": "B00005JKPT", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51JJ5vQUrJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Contempt (The Criterion Collection)"}
{"description": "An enormously entertaining (if somewhat shallow) affair from blockbuster   director Steven Spielberg. Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Frank Abagnale,  Jr., a  dazzling young con man who spent four years impersonating an  airline pilot, a  doctor, and a lawyer--all before he turned 21. All the  while he's pursued by a  dedicated FBI agent named Carl Hanratty (Tom  Hanks), whose dogged determination  stays one step behind Abagnale's  spontaneous wits. Both DiCaprio and Hanks turn  in enjoyable  performances and the movie has a bouncy rhythm that keeps it  zipping  along. However, it never gets under the surface of Frank's drive to lose   himself in other identities, other than a simplistic desire to please  his father  (Christopher Walken, excellent as always), nor does it  explore the complex  mechanics of fraud with any depth. By the movie's  end, it feels like one of  Frank's pilot uniforms--appearance without  substance.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00080ZG10", "B006OFN0SE", "B000M341QE", "B00AEBB8NI", "B001EZE5DI", "B004SIP7TE", "B000MZHW40", "0767905385", "B00005JMYC", "B002ZG980U", "B00049QQHI", "B0016Q2D66", "B00AEBB9F0", "B00003CWM3", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B000P0J0EW", "B00008DP4C", "B000PHVZNE", "B001N44BVQ", "B00005JOC9", "B004SIP7ZS", "B0007DFJ0G", "B007SPPANM", "B00H9KKGTO", "B002T9H2LA", "0800141806", "B000N6U0E2", "B000P0J0EM", "B00AEBB89W", "B000FVQLQQ", "B00001ZWUS", "B0050546MS", "B00DHHWXYY", "0783225733", "6304711891", "B00AEFY0F2", "B002VWNIEA", "B0051MKNV8", "B002ZG99N6", "B0077ATSSQ", "B00011CZRE", "B0013XZ2QK", "B00275EGWY", "B00005JKBC", "B00003CXWV", "B002O5M4T4", "B002FU8IWU", "B008MILL8W", "B004XQO90O", "B004SIP95G", "B000YAF4MA", "B005LAIIJY", "B00005JMJG", "B002QEHPQU", "0780631536", "B00DHDDE32", "B0031OCY2E", "0783240295", "B000P0J0BK", "B004FQX5B6", "B0034G4OUO", "B005HWAOP2", "6305313687", "B003UESJH4", "B000YABYLA", "B00005JKWX", "B00BEIYL6G", "B0058JEHSO", "B000A7DVR2", "B0002ZDVEU", "B00003CXZ1", "B00003CXQ4", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00005RYLX", "B001VPCINK", "B000FKO5QK", "B0045HCJRG", "B009POCG0Y", "B00AEBB9SM", "B002UZCJ8Y", "B002DU39GW", "6304806434", "B00JQYV0B4", "B00AEFXE9U", "B00004WG2F", "B000EXZFCQ", "B00005JMCN", "B00006RCNV", "B000K7VHQE", "B00441GYXS", "B00A24CAAW", "B0045HCJ8K", "B004SIP9Z6", "B002NZK5R8", "B000K7VHTQ", "B00AEFXXMI", "B00005JL78", "0783233477", "B000J3OTT6", "B000O77SRC"], "bought_together": ["B00080ZG10", "B000M341QE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004SIP7TE", "B002ZG980U", "B00AEBB8NI", "B00ALTQRPW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 7335}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.99, "brand": "Dreamworks Skg", "asin": "B00005JLSB", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51bPnAto--L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Catch Me If You Can (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition)"}

{"description": "James Bond DVDs have in general been pretty loaded, butDie Another Dayraises the bar with a two-disc set featuring dynamic DTS 6.1 ES and Dolby Digital 5.1 EX sound that makes good use of the rear speakers. The first commentary track is by Pierce Brosnan and Rosamund Pike (who plays villain Miranda Frost). They weren't together at the time, so their comments are spliced into one track. Brosnan has a good time watching and is proud of the film but also doesn't take himself too seriously (\"They don't teach you this stuff at drama school: 'OK, now you're going to be electrocuted by the bad guy.'\"). Self-proclaimed \"Bond novice\" Pike also is proud of the film and says she's annoyed by people who question whether there's still a need for Bond. On the second commentary track, director Lee Tamahori and producer Michael G. Wilson chat about topics as diverse as casting, Bond lore, and product placements. For more Bond lore, don't overlook the trivia track, which offers pop-up tidbits about the filming and tips on the inside jokes.The centerpiece of the second disc is the 80-minute \"InsideDie Another Day\" documentary, which is a set of featurettes strung together. Topics include the opening surfing sequence; the scenes set in North Korea and Cuba (including Halle Berry's bikini tribute to Ursula Andress); the ice palace; post-production elements such as computer graphics, editing, and music; the car battle (finding strong ice was the key safety issue); and the passing of the \"Q\" torch from Desmond Llewellyn to John Cleese.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000NIBURQ", "B000M53GM2", "B000RPCK1U", "B000NDEXPM", "B000M53GMW", "B000RPCK1K", "B000RPCK24", "B000NIBURG", "B000M53GLS", "B000RPCK1A", "B000NIBUR6", "B000M53GN6", "B001PPLIEG", "B001R10BN2", "B00AQSN7HE", "B000RPCK0Q", "B000M53GNG", "B000NIBUS0", "B000NDEXPC", "B00004RG62", "B000M53GMC", "B007REV4T8", "B00004WEJZ", "B00005JL0I", "B009PN18R2", "B008YAPQX4", "B004BR7XLM", "B009PN3OD8", "B003QO8TOQ", "B000HRMAPE", "B000VNMMR0", "B0000BYRO7", "B00AZFECL8", "B000EGDB10", "B004EPYZUS", "B0004Z33EQ", "B00AIBZMD6", "B009A87Z6U", "B009RO9LKK", "B000SK5Z70", "B00003CXMV", "6305657947", "B00005JLYW", "B00005JN2Z", "B00023B1LC", "B005PTYP70", "B00008G8M4", "B00005JNJV", "B00000G3PA", "B000P0J06K", "B002UZCJ8Y", "B002ZG9864", "0792844068", "B00005JKIP", "0792166736", "0790732238", "B00AS1Q93S", "B003Q6D2B4", "B0002I84N0", "B000U1ZV8K", "B008JFURII", "B00JA3RVG4", "B000MZHW40", "B00026ZG10", "0790732149", "B000FKO3HG", "B000AP04FG", "B008JFUS0U", "B0001FGC1U", "B00005JMQW", "B009L6UDUG", "B00AVWIQZS", "B0013BM63O", "B00005JLRT", "B00E5I2M6I", "B001TK80C0", "B00AZMFJYA", "B0007KZQAM", "B002ZG999U", "B00BUAEYVK", "B009A87ZQU", "B000P0J06U", "B008JFUO72", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B00003CY0V", "B00E5I2MCM", "B0036TGSR6", "B003AWRMBU", "B0000BYRO9", "B008JFUNHI", "B00177YA1K", "6304696221", "B0021L8V0M", "B00006G8FD", "B000UR9T8C", "B002GNOSFM", "B003UESJFQ", "B0006L0LOS", "B000AYELVU"], "bought_together": ["B000NIBURQ", "B000M53GM2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000M53GM2", "B000RPCK1U", "B000M53GN6", "B000RPCK0Q"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 38500}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.0, "brand": "MGM", "asin": "B00005JLBE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51kgPWMuVFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Die Another Day (Widescreen Special Edition)"}
{"description": "TheNemesisDVD is distinguished by excellent picture and thrilling sound, especially in the starship battle sequences.  The bonus features are much more generous than the offerings on previousStar Trektheatrical films other than the two-disc special editions.  There are four featurettes (46 minutes total) discussing the casting of Shinzon, development of the story line, shooting the action scenes, and the themes of family and change that run through the film.  Director Stuart Baird contributes a commentary track that is a bit dry and sometimes silent.  He mentions how he's not aTrekinsider and that because he was working in an established setting he didn't have the freedom of creation that directors usually do.  He also discusses the mechanics of shooting and points out where certain scenes were shortened or eliminated.  Seven of the cut scenes appear on the DVD, some introduced by Baird or Patrick Stewart.  They're interesting to see (and the alternate ending is pretty funny), but none was a great loss from the finished film.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00000ILBK", "6305181721", "B002I9Z8EO", "B0000UJL96", "B0000AUHOH", "B00DB97LRC", "B00005JKHP", "B002I9Z8BM", "B002I9Z8AS", "B00008GEK4", "B002HWRYJE", "B00AZMFJYA", "B002I9Z8I0", "B000F7CDY4", "B000CCBCIA", "B008JLETMM", "B001J4E1CY", "B000HC2PLS", "B001TH16CY", "B00151QY9Y", "B0000UJLVY", "B00005OAZZ", "B007WCJM1C", "B001M4YZ90", "B000BKDNX0", "B00JJ3EH6C", "B000063V8S", "B000FEBWTY", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B002XTXG1G", "B00005Y1NF", "B00BHWG0CM", "B001PUTN3Y", "B000063V8T", "0780622650", "B001TH16CE", "B00BHWG0DQ", "B0002VEWCE", "1415713812", "B001ASPO7K", "B001TH16D8", "B00005JNTU", "B00006HBUJ", "B0000844I8", "B000AYELVA", "B001EDVNNU", "B001DHXT3Y", "B000M53GN6", "B0009X7BDC", "B00000ILDF", "B000HCO83Q", "B001GCUO1Q", "B000RPCK1U", "B00HEPDGKA", "B008JFUO72", "B000063V8R", "B001DHXT6G", "B00003CX5P", "B001RHGRT8", "B00BEZTMFY", "B00C2CDJ34", "B00CTSDDVO", "B0017VG69U", "B004LWZW42", "B000AYELVU", "B000HEWEJ4", "B00005JLXH", "B005FNLUR4", "B000228EBS", "B000NIBURQ", "B000291Q52", "B005LAIGXW", "0783225520", "B0007X7044", "0767803434", "B00AEFYGBA", "B000M53GM2", "B0045HCJ9O", "B000NIBUR6", "B000VI70QS", "B00005JLF5", "B000NTMA0Q", "B00CAATSME", "B000MR9CXW", "B004LWZWGA", "B0001NBNFW", "B007REV4T8", "B000RPCK1A", "B000M53GMW", "B008SAPCTS", "B000ASDFEA", "B00005R2IS", "B000RPCK1K", "B00008G8M4", "B000OVLBHG", "B001DHXT20", "B00E5I2M6I", "B00000ILDH", "B001DTPZNY"], "bought_together": ["B00000ILBK", "B002I9Z8EO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002I9Z8GM", "B002I9Z8I0", "6305181721", "6305127638"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 136962}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.89, "brand": "Generic", "asin": "B00005JLRT", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/519EJJQ3GNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Star Trek - Nemesis (Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "Like a good dream, Sofia Coppola'sLost in Translationenvelops you with an aura of fantastic light, moody sound, head-turning love, and a feeling of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu, even though you've probably never been to this neon-fused version of Tokyo. Certainly Bob Harris has not. The 50-ish actor has signed on for big money shooting whiskey ads instead of doing something good for his career or his long-distance family. Jetlagged, helplessly lost with his Japanese-speaking director, and out of sync with the metropolis, Harris (Bill Murray, never better) befriends the married but lovelorn 25-year-old Charlotte (played with heaps of poise by 18-year-old Scarlett Johansson). Even before her photographer husband all but abandons her, she is adrift like Harris but in a total entrapment of youth. How Charlotte and Bill discover they are soul mates will be cherished for years to come. Written and directed by Coppola (The Virgin Suicides), the film is far more atmospheric than plot-driven: we whiz through Tokyo parties, karaoke bars, and odd nightlife, always ending up in the impossibly posh hotel where the two are staying. The wisps of bittersweet loneliness of Bill and Charlotte are handled smartly and romantically, but unlike modern studio films, this isn't a May-November fling film. Surely and steadily, the film ends on a much-talked-about grace note, which may burn some, yet awards film lovers who \"always had Paris\" with another cinematic destination of the heart.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305428239", "B0007UC8Y4", "B000BX8R10", "B00005JMJG", "B0000640VJ", "B0010X8NF0", "B003UESJLU", "B007L6VR12", "0767821408", "B00007AJF8", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B00DW5IKYS", "B001QOGYBI", "B000M06KJ8", "B00005JLRE", "B00000G02H", "B0006TPE4C", "B0007TKOAA", "B00AEFXESQ", "B00DYVUBYM", "B00H9HZITU", "B000Z8GZYW", "B004SEUIXS", "B00AEFXN9G", "B003CRM6PA", "B00008RH3J", "B000EQHXNW", "B0001I1K32", "B0008JIJ2O", "B001DJ7PR8", "B0007DFJ0G", "B0009PVZD2", "B000CS464G", "B00337KM2S", "B003102JDM", "0790734796", "B001P3SA8K", "B00JJ3EHCG", "B0000WN0SC", "B00003CWTI", "B00003CXZ4", "B00008975Z", "B0057ZAA6W", "B000IU37SO", "B00004RJ73", "B00AEFXGIY", "B007P9HW3M", "B005MYEQ4U", "B000K7VHQE", "B00005JNC2", "B00079Z9VO", "B000063JDE", "B0001US61O", "B0000WN15O", "B00G7QPXUI", "B0041KKYEM", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00006LPGP", "B0006H32EI", "B00005JKJA", "B00AEFYCL4", "B000KX0IOK", "B002T9H2LA", "B001TOD92C", "B004XVMCKS", "B00AEBB9CS", "B008220DGE", "0767802519", "B000069HYF", "B007D5E7C2", "B000M7XRAG", "B004U7MR14", "B003O7I6SE", "B000A7DVR2", "B005LAIIJY", "B00A81MV3U", "B000055Y0X", "B00005V9HH", "B000E33VWW", "0783225903", "B00AEFXE9U", "B000N6TX1I", "B00CIOD6HK", "B0021L8UOY", "B004SIP95G", "B000PAAJZ6", "B002ZG980U", "B007UW9WOQ", "B00GKOJ98E", "B0014D5RBE", "B00011CZRE", "B001HN699A", "B000M4RG7E", "B003ELKNH2", "0767802535", "B00121QGPY", "B004FQX5B6", "6305609764", "B0009A40ES"], "bought_together": ["B0007UC8Y4", "6305428239"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00JAQJMJ0", "B007L6VR12", "B001QOGYBI", "B0010X8NF0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 2901}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.77, "brand": "Universal Studios", "asin": "B00005JMJ4", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518vLN4%2B7KL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Lost in Translation"}

{"description": "Jamie Foxx's uncannily accurate performance isn't the only good thing aboutRay. Riding high on a wave of Oscar buzz, Foxx proved himself worthy of all the hype by portraying blind R&B; legend Ray Charles in a warts-and-all performance that Charles approved shortly before his death in June 2004. Despite a few dramatic embellishments of actual incidents (such as the suggestion that the accidental drowning of Charles's younger brother caused all the inner demons that Charles would battle into adulthood), the film does a remarkable job of summarizing Charles's strengths as a musical innovator and his weaknesses as a philandering heroin addict who recorded some of his best songs while flying high as a kite. Foxx seems to be channeling Charles himself, and as he did with the life of Ritchie Valens in La Bamba, director Taylor Hackford gets most of the period details absolutely right as he chronicles Ray's rise from \"chitlin circuit\" performer in the early '50s to his much-deserved elevation to legendary status as one of the all-time great musicians. Foxx expertly lip-syncs to Ray Charles' classic recordings, but you could swear he's the real deal in a film that honors Ray Charles without sanitizing his once-messy life.--Jeff ShannonMore on Ray CharlesModern Sounds in Country and Western Music(CD)The Genius of Ray Charles(CD)Ray Charles and Betty Carter--Dedicated to You(CD)Genius & Soul--The 50th Anniversary Collection(CD)Ray: A Tribute to the Movie, the Music, and the Man(book)More Albums by Ray Charles", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000E8QVWY", "B001P3SA94", "B00465I1CE", "B00005JKMQ", "6305428409", "B003BV8I3Q", "B00AEFXTKO", "B0002LE9HC", "B000BOH8X2", "B00AEFYG3S", "0790739313", "B000JJSL1W", "B000A50460", "B00005TQ44", "0783230524", "B0009R1TJ0", "0780627822", "B00AEFZ63M", "B000P0J092", "B002VWNICM", "B00EV4EUT8", "B000JLTRH2", "B000N6U0E2", "B0041QSZS8", "0783237367", "078324228X", "B00AEFY6TW", "B003HKN534", "B00BTYPWDQ", "B00G4Q3KOC", "B00007AJG1", "B00007L4KF", "B00ANDDBBY", "B000BITV9W", "0783114907", "B00007AJG2", "1558908390", "B00005JLRZ", "B000FVQLQQ", "6305692572", "0767821637", "B002CA68NO", "B00AFEXRME", "B002CPMB9O", "B004SIP93S", "B000063JDI", "B00005NB8K", "B00125WAWS", "6305505780", "B000IFRT4W", "B001TUZGPO", "B009NNM9OA", "B000RB6XG2", "B000P0J0CY", "B0001FR3IQ", "B000FVQLRA", "B00066FAVW", "B002XMGGK6", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00DW5IL2E", "B00005JPK8", "0767811070", "B000I0QL7I", "B000069I0E", "B00080ZG10", "0306814315", "B000P0J0EM", "B00AEFXP8K", "B00049QQHI", "B00000JGHV", "B0007CEXYK", "B0001Q4BOE", "B0000YEE6M", "B000NIVJF4", "B008Y1YJN6", "B00066VTU8", "B001132GNY", "B0006QAIG4", "B0034G4OSG", "B000C20VRS", "0800141741", "B00A2H9QN8", "B000Y11B8K", "B00005LB86", "B000056VP4", "B00005JL72", "B000095J01", "B000Q7ZNZ4", "B002CAWNEM", "B003UESJHO", "B00066FAQW", "0783230389", "B0013FDM7E", "B00007ELEO", "B00AMEZDJW", "B000P0J0CE", "B003Y5H4ZC", "0767821955", "B00003GPFT", "B0021L8V2A"], "bought_together": ["B000E8QVWY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0002LE9HC", "B000E8QVWY", "B000BOH8X2", "B00AZMFJYA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 17277}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.89, "brand": "Universal Studios", "asin": "B00005JND5", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41RQ8ETK19L._SX300_.jpg", "title": "Ray (Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "Batman Beginsdiscards the previous four films in the series and recasts the Caped Crusader as a fearsome avenging angel. That's good news, because the series, which had gotten off to a rousing start under Tim Burton, had gradually dissolved into self-parody by 1997'sBatman & Robin. As the title implies,Batman Beginstells the story anew, when Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) flees Western civilization following the murder of his parents. He is taken in by a mysterious instructor named Ducard (Liam Neeson in another mentor role) and urged to become a ninja in the League of Shadows, but he instead returns to his native Gotham City resolved to end the mob rule that is strangling it. But are there forces even more sinister at hand?Cowritten by the team of David S. Goyer (a veteran comic book writer) and director Christopher Nolan (Memento),Batman Beginsis a welcome return to the grim and gritty version of the Dark Knight, owing a great debt to the graphic novels that preceded it. It doesn't have the razzle dazzle, or the mass appeal, ofSpider-Man 2(though the Batmobile is cool), and retelling the origin means it starts slowly, like most \"first\" superhero movies. But it's certainly the best Bat-film since Burton's original, and one of the best superhero movies of its time. Bale cuts a good figure as Batman, intense and dangerous but with some of the lightheartedness Michael Keaton brought to the character. Michael Caine provides much of the film's humor as the family butler, Alfred, and as the love interest, Katie Holmes (Dawson's Creek) is surprisingly believable in her first adult role.

But midway through the first season, Jaleel White made a one-shot appearance as neighborhood nerd Urkel. With oversized glasses, undersized body, screechy voice and indomitable self-confidence, Urkel proved irresistibly funny, turning White into an overnight sensation and a new star of the show.

{"description": "In the DVD world, the Criterion Collection label generally indicates that you'll be getting your money's worth on the extras, andThe Life Aquatic with Steve Zissouis no exception. These two discs contain many features that fans of the film will expect: Seu Jorge performing David Bowie songs (complete versions), many documentary scenes of writer-director Wes Anderson at work, interviews with cast members including Cate Blanchett, Bill Murray, etc. Other extras are a little more confusing. For instance, does Seymour Cassel, who plays Zissou's deceased partner, know what he's doing when he complains to a hairless cigar merchant about having to go faux bald? And what's the deal withMondo Monda? It's a cringingly awkward Italian talk show in which the host (also an actor in the film) interviews the screenwriters, throwing out references so random and esoteric that even smart guys like Anderson and Noah Baumbach are left speechless. It's all a joke, right? In the end, the bonus material accomplishes its primary goal: get those who already enjoy the film to like it just a little bit more.--Leah Weathersby", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0010X8NF0", "6305428239", "B0000640VJ", "0767821408", "B007L6VR12", "B001QOGYBI", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B007L6VR6M", "B000CS464G", "B0006TPE4C", "081099741X", "B00005JMJ4", "B000934FC2", "B0035G5IOE", "B00JAQJNN0", "B00005JMJG", "B000BRD6T4", "B0045NXMJE", "B00007AJF8", "B00H9HZITU", "B0018BD9DA", "B004SEUIXS", "1623160510", "B001P3SA8K", "B000JMK6LW", "B0018O4YT0", "B001MM3AZM", "B0006H32EI", "B002E2M5IC", "B0012E2GFK", "B000M4RG7E", "B0007DFJ0G", "B000Y7U98C", "B001NPD9PY", "B00IJXJAIS", "B000A7DVR2", "B008MIMWP8", "B004FQX5B6", "B00GKOJ98E", "0783228457", "B000K7VHOG", "B002LMV7RA", "B00008RH3J", "B0009A40ES", "B00DL46ZN8", "0957490909", "B000F5GNX8", "B00005JLRE", "B00006AUIH", "B00005V9HH", "B00GMV8L1Q", "B001JIE7JM", "B000IU37SO", "B004RQDQIQ", "B00AEBB8SS", "B00006LPGP", "B00000K3TS", "B00H9L28OO", "B007D5E7C2", "B000065AI3", "B0033WH6MW", "B008220D5K", "B0014D5RBE", "B001BPJJ9G", "B00005JL78", "B007D0FVRM", "B00AEFYOJE", "B00003CXZ4", "6304493681", "B0083V2W4U", "B000Z8GZYW", "B008R65XNS", "0783229526", "B00HGGUTPW", "B003UESJMO", "B005HK13SG", "B000P0J0EW", "B002VWNIAY", "B000P0J0D8", "B004SIP7ZS", "B001HN69AY", "B003XURDAY", "B00H7KJRVY", "B00ECR7KX2", "B001GMAVGE", "B005LAIIJY", "B000055Y0X", "B0000AC8LR", "B000K7VHQE", "B00AEFYAMA", "6305922756", "B0041T52S6", "B009YQJ322", "B003CRM6PA", "B002T9H2LA", "B000O76ZQC", "B0040QYROA", "B005MYEQ4U", "B00I6JOD2S", "B00FZ4KR4U"], "bought_together": ["B0010X8NF0", "B0000640VJ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00JAQJMJ0", "B0010X8NF0", "B007L6VR12", "B0000640VJ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 72305}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.5, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B00005JNLQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51H5Q2VBE1L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou (The Criterion Collection)"}

{"description": "Movies don't come any bigger than Peter Jackson'sKing Kong, a three-hour remake of the 1933 classic that marries breathtaking visual prowess with a surprising emotional depth. Expanding on the original story of the blonde beauty and the beast who falls for her, Jackson creates a movie spectacle that matches hisLord of the Ringsfilms and even at times evokes their fantasy world while celebrating the glory of '30s Hollywood. Naomi Watts stars as Ann Darrow, a vaudeville actress down on her luck in Depression-era New York until manic filmmaker Carl Denham (a game but miscast Jack Black) entices her with a lead role. Dazzled by the genius of screenwriter Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody), Ann boards the tramp steamer S.S.Venture, which she--and most of the wary crew--believes is headed for Singapore. Denham, however, is in search of the mythic Skull Island, hoping to capture its wonders on film and make a fortune. What he didn't count on were some scary natives who find that the comely Darrow looks like prime sacrifice material for a mysterious giant creature....There's no point in rehashing the entire plot, as every movie aficionado is more than familiar with the trajectory ofKing Kong; the challenge facing Jackson, his screenwriters, and the phenomenal visual-effects team was to breathe new life into an old, familiar story. To that degree, they achieve what could be best called a qualified success. Though they've assembled a crackerjack supporting cast, including Thomas Kretschmann as theVenture's hard-bitten captain and young Jamie Bell as a plucky crewman, the first third of the movie is rather labored, with too much minute detail given over to sumptuous re-creations of '30s New York and the unexciting initial leg of theVenture's sea voyage. However, once the film finds its way to Skull Island (which bears more than a passing resemblance toLOTR's Mordor),Kongturns into a dazzling movie triumph, by turns terrifying and awe-inspiring. The choreography and execution of the action set pieces--including one involving Kong and a trio of Tyrannosaurus Rexes, as well as another that could be charitably described as a bug-phobic's nightmare--is nothing short of landmark filmmaking, and a certain Mr. Spielberg should watch his back, asKongtrumps most anything that has come before it.Despite the visual challenges ofKing Kong, the movie's most difficult hurdle is the budding romance between Ann and her simian soulmate. Happily, this is where Jackson unqualifiedly triumphs, as this unorthodox love story is tenderly and humorously drawn, by turns sympathetic and wondrous. Watts, whose accessibility balances out her almost otherworldly loveliness, works wonders with mere glances, and Andy Serkis, who digitally embodies Kong here much as he did Gollum in theLOTRfilms, breathes vibrant life into the giant star of the film without ever overplaying any emotions. The final, tragic act of the film, set mostly atop the Empire State Building, is whereKongearns its place in movie history as a work that celebrates both the technical and emotional heights that film can reach.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"bought_together": ["B000EHQTZO", "B00AEFYEU8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000EHQTZO", "B00AEFYEU8", "B0087ZG7HK", "0767817478"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 32487}, "categories": [["Movies & TV"]], "price": 8.94, "brand": "Universal Studios", "asin": "B00005JO20", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/513Y54TGdwL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "King Kong (Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "More than a few critics hailedSpider-Man 2as \"the best superhero movie ever,\" and there's no compelling reason to argue--thanks to a bigger budget, better special effects, and a dynamic, character-driven plot, it's a notch aboveSpider-Manin terms of emotional depth and rich comic-book sensibility.Ordinary PeopleOscar-winner Alvin Sargent received screenplay credit, and celebrated author and comic-book expert Michael Chabon worked on the story, but it's director Sam Raimi's affinity for the material that bringsSpidey 2to vivid life. When a fusion experiment goes terribly wrong, a brilliant physicist (Alfred Molina) is turned into Spidey's newest nemesis, the deranged, mechanically tentacled \"Doctor Octopus,\" obsessed with completing his experiment and killing Spider-Man (Tobey Maguire) in the process. Even more compelling is Peter Parker's urgent dilemma: continue his burdensome, lonely life of crime-fighting as Spider-Man, or pursue love and happiness with Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst)? Molina's outstanding as a tragic villain controlled by his own invention, and the action sequences are nothing less than breathtaking, but the real success ofSpider-Man 2is its sense of priorities. With all of Hollywood's biggest and best toys at his disposal, Raimi and his writers stay true to the Marvel mythology, honoringSpider-Mancreators Stan Lee and Steve Ditko, and setting the bar impressively high for the challenge ofSpider-Man 3.--Jeff ShannonDVD Features:The first commentary track is by director Sam Raimi and a self-deprecating Tobey Maguire speaking in tandem, and producer (and Marvel CEO) Avi Arad and coproducer Grant Curtis speaking in tandem. They discuss a number of topics, including Raimi's memory of his excitement over Richard Donner's Superman and how the character of Black Cat had to be dropped from the film. The second commentary is by six members of the Oscar-nominated effects team, and one of their primary focuses is how Doc Ock's arms were achieved by a combination of puppetry and CGI.The centerpiece of the second disc is a massive two-hour documentary that can be viewed all at once or in 12 separate pieces. It covers the development of the story, the visual effects, costumes, stunts, and sound and music. Three shorter featurettes cover Peter Parker's struggle between his personal and hero lives, Doc Ock, and the women in Spider-Man's life, and what's interesting is how they discuss those topics not just in relation to the movies but to the comic books as well. (For example, Betty Brant and Gwen Stacy had a much greater impact in the comics.) There's a scene in which you can toggle among three different camera angles, and a gallery of 17 paintings Alex Ross created for the opening sequence.

{"description": "Literary adaptations just don't get any better than director Joe Wright's 2005 version of Jane Austen'sPride & Prejudice. The key word here isadaptation, because Wright and gifted screenwriter Deborah Moggach have taken liberties with Austen's classic novel that purists may find objectionable, but in this exquisite film their artistic decisions are entirely justified and exceptionally well executed. It's a more rural England that we see here, circa 1790 (as opposed to Austen's early 19th century), in which Elizabeth Bennet (Keira Knightley) is one of several sisters primed for marriage, with an anxious mother (Brenda Blethyn) only too desperate to see her daughters paired off with the finest, richest husbands available. Elizabeth is strong-willed and opinionated, but her head (not to mention her pride and prejudice) lead her heart astray when she meets the wealthy Mr. Darcy (Matthew Macfadyen), whose own sense of decency and discretion (not to mentionhispride and prejudice) prevent him from expressing his mutual affection. They're clearly meant for each other, and as Knightley's performance lights up the screen (still young enough to be girlishly impertinent, yet wise beyond her 20 years), Austen's timeless romance yields yet another timeless adaptation, easily on par with the belovedBBC miniseriesthat has been embraced by millions since originally broadcast in 1995. Individual tastes will vary as to which version should be considered \"definitive,\" but with a stellar supporting cast including Judi Dench and Donald Sutherland, this impeccable production achieves its own kind of perfection.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_viewed": ["0800141660", "B00003JRCQ", "B00G6HO368", "B004SIP7AS", "B004P7CNZO", "B0053Q9DHW", "B000244FDW", "B000GRUQKQ", "B000244FFU", "B0018YCF50", "B001L57ZZG", "B004XVMCMQ", "B00AF82WTO", "B008D1RCHC", "B000Z27HLS", "B000BEZQ0Y", "0767851013", "0486284735", "B0002ZH5PQ", "B0012Q3T6I", "6303921248", "B002XTBE6K", "B001PJRAUS", "B00HYMBAQ0", "B0080QOL1A", "B00062IZ0Y", "B001C4AFOY", "B0012XIGVE", "B002KHNFFS", "B000244FF0", "B0012OVCE6", "B00HYMASS6", "B0009UZGAA", "B000784WMW", "0767020308", "B000LPQ6DE", "B001TJYFRU", "B000FTCEYQ", "B000ZS8GW6", "B005GRF2UK", "B004FM2EL2", "B00G7QPXAI", "149440477X", "B009ERK0SW", "B00006ZXSK", "B0000AUHPK", "B004UOHNCA", "0767020294", "B00094AS9U", "B000Z27HMW", "B002DY9KR0", "B000N4SHOE", "B000683VI4", "193799418X"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00G6HO368", "0800141660", "B00003JRCQ", "B005S9EK5Y"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "asin": "B00005JOHI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZGC68T2JL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Pride &amp; Prejudice"}

{"description": "This two-disc collector's edition ofPirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chestis packed with over five hours of special features that delve into everything from creating the mythology-inspired Davy Jones and Kraken figures, to working and planning without a completed script, the incredible CGI techniques used in the film, the intense sword training sessions and stunt work, and the unpredictability of filming on location in the Caribbean. The audio commentary by writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio is an interesting and insightful look into the finished film, but perhaps even more revealing is the 25-minute \"Charting the Return\" preproduction diary in which everyone from producer Jerry Bruckheimer to associate director Peter Kohn and writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio give a sense of the enormity of the project of concurrently writing and filming two sequels toPirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl. The overwhelming logistics of planning and casting without a finished script, scouting and preparing remote locations, constructing a new Black Pearl, and functional props like the rolling water wheel, and cutting costs to stay within budget are nothing less than mind-boggling. In the hourlong \"According to Plan\" feature, director Gore Verbinski, producer Jerry Bruckheimer, and a host of others detail the enormity of the project, focusing on the stamina involved in a 200-day shooting schedule and the need for adaptability and flexibility in dealing with everything from behind schedule excavations to the logistics of shooting on moving water and even the natural fury of a full-blown hurricane.  Shorter featurettes \"Meet Davy Jones: Anatomy of a Legend\" and \"Creating the Kraken\" focus on the mythological creatures in the film and the awesome visual effects and advances in CGI technology that made them possible.  \"Mastering the Blade\" follows Orlando Bloom (Will Turner), Keira Knightley (Elizabeth Swann), and Jack Davenport (Norrington) through some intense sword-fighting training sessions and \"Fly on the Set: The Bone Cage\" offers a frightening look at what it was like to shoot the bone cage scene of the movie.  Other bonus features include bloopers, an interactive tour of Johnny Depp's special makeup effects and wardrobe details, a look at how the 1967 Disney Land Pirates of the Caribbean ride was recently \"re-imagineered\" to incorporate some of the characters and elements from the new movies, producer Jerry Bruckheimer's photo diary, and a glimpse of the glitzy June 24, 2006 red carpet premiere on Disney Land's main street.--Tami Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000U7WV1Y", "B00005JM5E", "B005COPWZW", "B004A8ZWUQ", "B0013BM63O", "B00005JN5E", "B004M1A21K", "B004DTLK80", "B000VR0570", "B00005JKZV", "B00005JKZY", "B00005JKCH", "B001HN694K", "B00005JPH2", "B00AEFYGBA", "B00BEZTMFY", "B001HQZJMU", "B00E5I2M6I", "B006VRRGNK", "B001BEK8HO", "B000E8M0VA", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B001E75QH0", "B008QE9XD2", "B00E5I2MCM", "B00LG6YEKE", "B00AEBBA72", "B007K3JFUQ", "B000HRMAPE", "B0090SI56Y", "B000E6EK2Y", "B0053FANRC", "B00005JMQW", "B008Y1YK9Y", "B00177YA1K", "B001TK80C0", "B000UR9T8C", "B00003CXI1", "B004EPYZUS", "B00003CXTA", "B001OQCV6A", "B0014Z4ON4", "B005G4TJUC", "B000F7CECK", "B00HFFE8HE", "B001GCUO1Q", "B0087ZG7J8", "B003YAR97K", "B008JFUNTG", "B001GCUO0W", "B000NIBURQ", "B0053FANPY", "B00023B1LC", "B003QO8TOQ", "B002VPE1BQ", "B00F84H73Q", "B003Y5H54W", "B00003CWT6", "B00007AJGH", "B00E5I2M9K", "B000W7F5SS", "B0049IHX2C", "B00000IRE6", "B001F7MSFM", "B000AYELVA", "B002ZG9904", "B000VWYJ86", "B00CFA222M", "B003UYUQZW", "B008UZ949K", "B0002KVUKM", "B000209KMW", "B000UVKGPI", "B0087ZG7HK", "B0000WN140", "B001EZE5BU", "B002PMV9FG", "B000HT386M", "B000NQRR1Q", "B00003CXZ1", "630529142X", "B0002ZDVEU", "B004A8ZWSS", "B00005JM5B", "B000BTITKS", "B00E5I2MEK", "B002HWRYJE", "B001GZ6QC4", "B000W796OM", "B00AQSN7HE", "B0046BI81W", "B001VLBDD0", "B0060FXDCG", "B0084IG8TM", "B005OCFGTO", "B000OLGCIE", "B008JFUS0U", "B00007AJG4", "B009JBWOU0", "B001B3LIOC"], "bought_together": ["B000U7WV1Y", "B00005JM5E"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005COPWZW", "B00005JM5E", "B0071JADFU", "B00005JPFX"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 72898}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 16.95, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B00005JP0F", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GQE7TQ72L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)"}

{"description": "Marriage is a huge step in any relationship and, with the divorce rate skyrocketing, some clergymen find it advisable to council prospective couples prior to the marriage ceremony. Reverend Frank (Robin Williams) takes his marriage preparation course to a whole new level, putting couples through a very unusual and grueling set of classes that cover everything from trust and communication to experiencing childbirth, meeting each other's needs in and out of bed, and group sessions on how to fight fairly. Happy couple Sadie Jones's (Mandy Moore) and Ben Murphy's (John Krasinski) perfect compatibility is tested to the limits with extraordinary (and hysterical) assignments like caring for twin baby robots that cry and poop without restraint while baby-sitting a friend's two young children and shopping for wedding china. Driving a car blindfolded while one's intended gives directions is no simple task either, but abstinence from sex and writing their own marriage vows may be the couple's most difficult homework assignments. Comedy reigns throughout the entire movie thanks to Robin Williams, his choir-boy assistant Josh Flitter (Nancy Drew) and the rest of the cast and laughing out loud is definitely a course requirement for viewers, but underneath the hilarity is a serious message about making marriage work.--Tami HoriuchiDVD featuresIncludes widescreen anamorphic and full-screen versionsAdditional scenes with optional director commentaryAsk Choir Boy: Choose which relationship/marital questions he answers", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00561BNI6", "B000OCZA04", "B000P0J08S", "B00104AYFQ", "B0000CDRVU", "B001TUZD8O", "B00005JN3W", "B000A343RI", "B00008WJD6", "B0015I2RT8", "B0034GK78W", "B002ZG989G", "B00003CXSM", "B001AKTZW8", "B003B3V0N4", "6304584210", "B004EPZ070", "B001BL96JI", "B00AEBB8NS", "B001OQCUZM", "B002ZG9968", "B000LC5B7O", "B00005JPSM", "B000Y7U93C", "B00005JG6N", "B001Y8DJVE", "B008R65XWO", "B003EYVXXC", "B000BKVQS4", "B0009OL7Z4", "B00AEBB9M8", "B000ELJAEM", "B002K0WBXW", "B000ICM5X0", "B000GB775E", "B000RETOGA", "B00005JN4H", "B00006FMUW", "B00386EZKE", "B002ZG97QK", "B00AEFY99O", "B0049TC88U", "B003Y5H524", "B0000DZ6N3", "B000MEYJHE", "B0021L8UOY", "B000E6EHE0", "B0038N9X3Q", "B00007976U", "B00AEFXWXI", "B00008VFCA", "B00005JN0Z", "B0038N9WKU", "B002SYAGNC", "B00007E2F5", "B00DMDE02Q", "B002ZG984Q", "B0015U0QVW", "B0012KJ0DK", "B004IK30PA", "B000YAA68C", "B0002OXRSG", "B002ZG97B0", "B0002I84N0", "B0007RT9M6", "B004SIP9X8", "B000099T4E", "B00006ZXSL", "B001CTA1UM", "B001C5LLQ4", "B000HCPS94", "B00164KYV4", "B000P0J0DS", "B004SIP7I0", "B00005JMXX", "B002ZG998G", "B0000897EG", "B000J4QW7W", "B00466HN7M", "B00AEBB8R4", "B003Y5H4ZW", "B002ZG98FU", "B005LAIIB2", "B000957O82", "B003UEYBPI", "B000EMGICS", "B00AEFYWQY", "B00029LO5E", "B002ZGW92E", "B0026BXHQ0", "B000VKL6T8", "B00HW3EZZE", "B005LAIGSM", "B000LC4Z8A", "B0010X5X4O", "B002ZG99UE", "B000E8N8H0", "B002U4UYZA", "B001HN69C2", "B004HO6I2E"], "bought_together": ["B000OCZA04"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0034GK78W", "B002ZG989G", "B00561BNI6", "B001Y8DJVE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 56082}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.99, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00005JPQE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51-wgdGowCL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "License to Wed"}
{"description": "Here's hoping James Mangold's big, raucous, and ultrabloody remake of3:10 to Yumaleads some moviegoers to check outDelmer Daves's beautifully lean, half-century-old original. That classic Western spun a tale of captured outlaw Ben Wade (Glenn Ford)--deadly but disarmingly affable--and the small-time rancher and family man, Dan Evans (Van Heflin), desperate enough to accept the job of helping escort the badman to Yuma prison. Wade, knowing that his gang will be along at any moment to spring him, works at persuading the ultimately lone deputy to accept a bribe, turn his back on \"duty,\" and go home safe and rich to his family. That the outlaw has come to admire his captor intriguingly complicates the suspense.All of the above applies in the new3:10, but it takes a lot more huffing and puffing to get Wade (Russell Crowe this time) and Evans (Christian Bale) into position for the showdown. Mostly, more is less. To Mangold's credit, his movie doesn't traffic in facile irony or postmodern detachment; it aims to be a straight-up Western and deliver the excitement and charisma the genre's fans are starved for. But recognizing that contemporary viewers might be out of touch with the bedrock simplicity and strength of the genre--not to mention its code of honor--Mangold has supplied both Evans and Wade with a plethora of backstory and \"motivations.\" At the overblown action climax, the crossfire of personal agendas is almost as frenetic as the copious gunplay. (By that point the movie has killed more people than the Lincoln County War.)Best thing about the remake is Russell Crowe's Ben Wade, a Scripture-quoting career villain with an artist's eye and a curiously principled sense of whom and when to murder. As his second-in-command, Ben Foster fairly pirouettes at every opportunity to commit mayhem, and Peter Fonda contributes a fierce portrait of an old Wade adversary turned bounty hunter for the Pinkerton detective agency.--Richard T.

{"description": "For anyone who thought the Oscar-winning documentaryMarch of the Penguinswas the most marvelous cinematic moment for these nomads of the south, you haven't seen nothing yet.Happy Feetis an animated wonder about a penguin named Mumble who can't sing, but can dance up a storm. George Miller, the driving force behind theBabe(andMad Max) movies, takes another creative step in family entertainment with this big, beautiful, music-fueled film that will have kids and their parents dancing in the streets. From his first moment alive, Mumble (voiced Elijah Woods) feels the beat and can't stop dancing. Unfortunately, emperor penguins are all about finding their own heart song, and the dancing youngster--as cute as he is--is a misfit. Luckily, he bumps into little blue penguins and a Spanish-infused group (led by Robin Williams) and begins a series of adventures. Miller has an exceptional variety of entertainment: Busby Berkley musical numbers, amusement-park thrills, exciting chase sequences (seals and orca lovers might like think otherwise), and even an environmental message that doesn't weigh you down. Best of all, you don't know where the movie is going in the last act, a rare occurrence these days in family entertainment. A fusion of rock songs, mashed-up and otherwise, are featured; this movie is as much a musical as a comedy. Mumble's solo dance to a new version of Stevie Wonder's \"I Wish\" by Fantasia, Patti, and Yolanda may be the most joyful moment on camera in 2006.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0006UEVT0", "B001DPHDCY", "B0006JMLRK", "B0012EM5D8", "B004HO6I4M", "B004EPZ0AC", "B002WJI2QQ", "B000AY74OG", "B0000AOX0O", "B00BG0RSJ4", "B00005JNQS", "B000RMJ4F8", "B0000640SC", "B005SDUV4E", "0783231474", "B00003CXJ4", "B00CWM58WY", "B0000VV4W2", "B0042U94UQ", "B0039N74CW", "6305161887", "B00AEFXMSS", "B000M343BC", "B00007LVCM", "B001ECQ75A", "B00005JNS0", "B00000JL8E", "B000GUJZ00", "B000056H26", "B008NNY9QW", "B004EPZ034", "B00G5G7EXY", "B000LPS2VI", "B005LAIH4A", "B00F522C7C", "B005LAIISA", "B00GDT5T9Y", "B007FF3HQM", "B000VBJEEG", "B003H9M1Q2", "B00029LO0Y", "B008JFUQ16", "B00005JMQZ", "B00EV1YZ96", "B000ION23A", "B0013FSL3E", "B003ZHVJGO", "B002ZG97YM", "B001NCDFTW", "B004G600A4", "B00009YXAW", "B005LAIHW2", "B00AFEX83C", "B00475B0H6", "B000UVKGPI", "B00ALMNCLQ", "B00HLTD2OE", "B00005JM7T", "B001HN6922", "B000BI5KV0", "B0013FSWT2", "B0030IIZ4M", "B004ODLUGM", "B001GCUO7A", "B005F96UJ6", "B000UFIYOO", "B000G75AZC", "B00005QFE1", "B0000VCZKW", "B00IEXX4KS", "B001THIQFO", "B000A2WAQK", "B001GCUNWQ", "B00B7EQPNE", "B002NZK5SW", "B0007PIDBQ", "B00AOCDDGC", "B000V5IP6U", "B0044RFTD8", "B00AEFXMGU", "B001KVZ6FW", "B00CHVJODE", "B000CZ0PT4", "B006JD48LO", "B0007Z0NYG", "B00EBBGLFC", "B00003CXB4", "B000BMGEJI", "B008YWY0HK", "B0002YLCOM", "B00E9ZATJO", "B004A8ZX3C", "B00I6JOD2S", "B005G3VCYY", "B00CQRN3QI", "B004OWQTZ0", "B0001OGUQI", "B004EPZ01G", "B00005JMFH", "B000GIXEWC"], "bought_together": ["B004HO6I4M"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004HO6I4M", "B00EBBGLFC", "B00G5G7EXY", "B00HR3D56O"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 21763}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.51, "brand": "Warner", "asin": "B00005JPCF", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51sX2Hrdz6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Happy Feet (Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "WithFlowers of Shanghai, Taiwanese director Hou Hsiao-Hsien delivers the opulent world of late-19th-century Chinese courtesans and their suitors miraculously intact. Hou's films are perhaps the most beguiling yet restrained in all of contemporary cinema, and this is no exception. Told as a series of panel-like portraits, the camera discreetly withdraws from raucous dinner parties and drinking games into the muted, jewel-like chambers of various flower girls. The need to procure patrons and eventual husbands from among their visitors lends an increasing air of anxiety to the games of seduction and betrayal played out within. As the young Master Wang (Tony Leung) soon learns, there is scarcely room for love inside this precarious world of decorum, addiction, and greed. Hou's canny ability to place characters so convincingly within a context is the work of a master filmmaker--nothing is ever assumed or contrived.

{"description": "Amores Perrosroughly translates to \"Love's a bitch,\" and it's an apt summation of this remarkable film's exploration of passion, loss, and the fragility of our lives. In telling three stories connected by one traumatic incident, Mexican director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu uses an intricate screenplay by novelist Guillermo Arriaga to make three movies in close orbit, expressing the notion that we are defined by what we lose--from our loves to our family, our innocence, or even our lives. These interwoven tales--about a young man in love with his brother's pregnant wife, a perfume spokeswoman and her married lover, and a scruffy vagrant who sidelines as a paid killer--are united by a devastating car crash that provides the film's narrative nexus, and by the many dogs that the characters own or care for. There is graphic violence, prompting a disclaimer that controversial dog-fight scenes were harmless and carefully supervised, but what emerges fromAmores Perrosis a uniquely conceptual portrait of people whom we come to know through their relationship with dogs. The film is simultaneously bleak, cynical, insightful, and compassionate, with layers of meaning that are sure to reward multiple viewings.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JL57", "B0041KKYF6", "B00008AOX5", "B000N3T0DW", "B001UV4XC4", "B0001CNRRU", "B0002TT0MI", "B002FHGESI", "B0036TGSJE", "B00005JNCZ", "B00AEFXGIY", "B00005JLQW", "B00080Z53O", "B000O76ZQC", "B00006G8G3", "B002M2T1VI", "B000FII31A", "B000GETTJI", "B00180IPM6", "B004XVMCMG", "B0041KKYFG", "B000K2V7F0", "B004SIP6GI", "B000YIGNCC", "B003O3EKRO", "B001S400C0", "B00005LZOD", "B002VECLXC", "B002H0LCGM", "B005HFI7IU", "B0007OCG5G", "B0011FLH14", "B008S2NABI", "B00GJNQ3S0", "B000JBXH78", "B0052LE7C4", "B000RHRGSK", "B001BNFR8U", "B000UUX2SW", "B00AEFXGAW", "B000LV6OC6", "B002M2T1V8", "B009AVCA6W", "B00KE3B8HC", "B004SIP7S0", "B00003CXRG", "B0042EJDGM", "B001MWBK6I", "B0032AJVE6", "B003R9IET0", "B00000F7E6", "B005Q4CKLC", "B00AZMFKXK", "B000274TLW", "B00432M43C", "B000H0M4AW", "B002BWP3UC", "B004PKNYK4", "B0004Z32NI", "B0007NBJHI", "B00E1S1MMM", "1572526599", "B0047685T6", "B0051T46YG", "B0000TPA56", "B0015ET3YO", "B000WC38IC", "B000OVLBGC", "B00JV0547O", "B002BWP3UM", "B001QX014A", "B000LXHFMW", "B00000F5KH", "B002BWP4A6", "B000N3SU6K", "B001R4XRLC", "B004DF3S84", "B000A7Q1O2", "B00112S8RS", "B00GHH9HJA", "B00075VX2C", "B00000G02H", "B001M9ELV2", "B00004RJ71", "B0036TGSJO", "B001M5BF7Y", "B00000F3CD", "B0001CNQX0", "B00003CWTI", "B000M7Y4S0", "B000QXDCLK", "B00003CWSX", "B0001VO38S", "B0002VEZ3U", "B000067IZ3", "B002QFYJF4", "B000N3T0DM", "B000NA6C2M", "B0000A2ZTY", "B001MYIXAC"], "bought_together": ["B00005JL57", "B000N3T0DW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0041KKYF6", "B0002TT0MI", "B002FHGESI", "B000O76ZQC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 23708}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.12, "brand": "LION&#39;S GATE ENTERTAINMENT", "asin": "B00005N8A9", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51X0QYZB1NL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Amores Perros"}

Musicologist Dr. Lily Penleric has a deep love of English folk ballads. After a humiliating failure to make full professor, she heads off to visit her sister's tiny school in rural Appalachia and finds herself in folk music central. Lily is entranced, but the locals are suspicious of the outlander's motivations. Issues of tolerance, clashing cultures, and Big Bad Men abound, butSongcatcherwisely focuses on the music. Janet McTeer does fine with the \"repressed academic gets in touch with the earth\" role, but her truly outstanding work is in revealing scholar Lily's rapture in her discoveries.

{"description": "The 3 1/4-inch \"pocket DVD\" includes production drawings, two scenes in various stages of production, and a short biography of Osamu Tezuka, the \"god ofmanga,\" who was instrumental in creating both the animation andmangaindustries in Japan. The interesting but often frustrating making-of featurette focuses on director Rintaro, screenwriter Katsuhiro Otomo, voice actors Yuka Imoto (Tima) and Kei Kobayashi (Kenichi), and composer Toshiyuki Honda. Curiously, Rintaro and Otomo agree that Tezuka would never have given them permission to film this earlymanga; Rintaro adds that he fears being haunted by Tezuka's ghost. Honda explains why he needed to create a memorable theme song for the film, but not why he used a New Orleans jazz idiom. Although they include brief remarks from the computer graphics crew, the documentarians neglect the artists who designed the dazzling art deco skyscrapers that dominate the title city--and the film.--Charles Solomon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0009P42S2", "B0001EFTVA", "B000VWYJ68", "B000TGCR3I", "B00014X8KO", "6304493681", "B00ENNBZ68", "B00CJ7Y0US", "B000E5LF0K", "B0000AK80C", "B00000JL42", "B008XEZXYI", "B00441GYS8", "B001VBM0Z0", "B0007939U2", "B000VWYJ5Y", "B000FILUL0", "B005WMADYE", "B00003CXBK", "B0007OY31G", "B006LLY8LY", "B00005UW7E", "B004DMIIVO", "B0006A9FMI", "B003NF97M6", "B00B1RB942", "B00B6DTFOC", "B009AVC922", "B004O05NN6", "B000PWQPAC", "B0001XAPY2", "B000TGCR3S", "B000089UBU", "B0023S49YU", "B0009MAO3W", "B00CSYR432", "B00ENNO1E6", "B004R0MF0M", "B0002J58QK", "B00ENNA62W", "B0009MAO3M", "B001D265RQ", "B0080K2E92", "B001DXPWO2", "B00000JL3V", "B009AVCAJ4", "B00HXEWH5W", "B00005NG6U", "B002ZTQVHK", "B00B2TUL1G", "B0006J28BO", "B0001XAPZ6", "B004047XUW", "B00008G8QC", "B00005V1XW", "B002U6CJO2", "B00005JLEU", "B0043988G2", "B003VOVW7M", "B000CDGVOO", "B007V9ECV6", "B005WMQ5R8", "B00B6DTF8S", "B00004YZGB", "B008D1RCS6", "B00HXEWDMY", "B00ENNUC9Y", "B0009IOQXK", "B002ZTQVLG", "B002NUULNG", "B00CJ7Y19I", "B008D1RCKY", "B0010358CQ", "B0009P42TQ", "B0083QJW8O", "B004DMIISM", "B00CSYRHG6", "B004CRR9EW", "B008XEZXRA", "B002EBRF7O", "B00AUJH32E", "B0030ZOYJ0", "B008XEZXXE", "B000KF0P1Y", "B004RIACSQ", "B001R10BDC", "B004GZZGW2", "B00008LDPU", "B00JM58C22", "B007CZ3FKS", "B00B1RB9AQ", "B00000JL4L", "B000CDGVOE", "B004CRR9G0", "B00009MGER", "B005LAIGX2", "B0030ZOYHC", "B00B40N2UK", "B00843TZEC", "B0050UEVKK"], "bought_together": ["B0009P42S2", "B0001EFTVA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000VWYJ68", "B00ENNBZ68", "B0009P42S2", "6304493681"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 28704}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.35, "brand": "Sim", "asin": "B00005V4XG", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51s4VbfTt5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Metropolis"}
{"description": "Sade fans may experience a range of emotions while watching the first-rateLovers Live, but one thing they won't feel is shortchanged--not with nearly two hours of concert footage, 22 songs (including almost all of herLovers Rockalbum), and DVD bonus features galore. That sultry, soulful Sade sound is in full effect throughout the concert (filmed at two Southern California locations in 2001), brought to life by a capable band, some superbly evocative visuals and sound effects, and, of course, the singer herself. The show is dramatic, but never overly theatrical; best of all, Sade, while perhaps not the world's greatest performer, is an adult--you'll find no pop-princess posing here. Of the nine songs fromLovers Rock, \"Slave Song\" and \"Immigrant\" are especially moving, revealing that Sade added some new flavors to her sound during her protracted layoff from performing. This show is pure Sade--and that's a good thing.--Sam Graham", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000056MMD", "B007NZDES0", "B007NESBK2", "B000056MMC", "B004W7D1V2", "B00005V9QJ", "B004TB8GS4", "B000X418HW", "B000087F5D", "B000051XXB", "B002YIHO7I", "B000051VWW", "B001675YUW", "B000051XX7", "B001R0KH3M", "B000051XXD", "B000053VAA", "B00005RDAH", "B0000E2FLJ", "B000LPS2RC", "B00005MAG5", "B005Y423ZC", "B000051XX9", "B00005AWMF", "B0002WZSZI", "B002BO2RWW", "B003KWWDJG", "B00004XMSE", "B008DVJOEG", "B000BI1YT2", "B001F9FHFI", "B0000E2FLC", "B00AAQ7LP6", "B00005Y3ZM", "B00092ZL80", "B0009G0186", "B0000AVHDC", "B0050JN8BE", "B000050IN5", "B0042RUMJG", "B001R60ESE", "B00006CXI3", "B000A2RRF4", "B000LW7OYM", "B00092ZMDY", "B0000584ZV", "B00J0LH16Q", "B0002IQI2Y", "B00CQO9Y1E", "6305781427", "B00A3Z1C9A", "1573300195", "B006T8KT6M", "B0000UQQTE", "B00008HCCF", "B0001MDPEA", "B000WGZGNS", "B004T1RAWW", "B0084I9QIW", "B00005U2K8", "B000GW8RYI", "B0000TB03W", "B001FBSLH2", "B000I5XD06", "B000094J89", "B003S6T62Q", "B00078FAKK", "B004USUP12", "B003UPPO2G", "B0019HQIFE", "B00004ST9Q", "B00005LMA5", "B00I5NKPWC", "B0017WI5JI", "B003BUAOZ2", "B00AR1G3FS", "B00004Z4VG", "B0002JZT50", "B001VB8UAE", "1573300357", "B007OAAK0O", "B004USUOUO", "6305603898", "B0019HQIGS", "B002E2M5IW", "B00CS1N1XC", "B002EIJ9HQ", "B004LY8QCK", "B001VS46DM", "B00005AQML", "B00HFG3UC2", "1573300934", "B007OCD1OE", "B000FGG738", "B0000TWMMA", "B005MYEQ2W", "B00005RIIY", "B0001CCXBQ", "B0001WPQJ2", "B00005NGA0"], "bought_together": ["B000056MMD", "B007NZDES0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B007NZDES0", "B000056MMD", "B00005V9QJ", "B000056MMC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 28707}, "categories": [["CDs & Vinyl", "Pop", "Adult Contemporary"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Pop", "Vocal Pop"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "R&B", "Contemporary R&B"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "R&B", "Soul"], ["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 11.89, "brand": "SADE", "asin": "B00005YUNM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/419WZV7P9AL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Sade - Lovers Live"}
{"description": "In a way,Scarlet Streetis a remake. It's taken from a French novel,La Chienne(literally, \"The Bitch\") that was first filmed by Jean Renoir in 1931.  Renoir brought to the sordid tale all the color and vitality of Montmartre; Fritz Lang's version shows us a far harsher and bleaker world. The film replays the triangle set-up from Lang's previous picture,The Woman in the Window, with the same three actors. Once again, Edward G. Robinson plays a respectable middle-aged citizen snared by the charms of Joan Bennett's streetwalker, with Dan Duryea as her low-life pimp. But this time around, all three characters have moved several notches down the ethical scale. Robinson, who in the earlier film played a college professor who kills by accident, here becomes a downtrodden clerk with a nagging, shrewish wife and unfilled ambitions as an artist, a man who murders in a jealous rage. Bennett is a mercenary vamp, none too bright, and Duryea brutal and heartless. The plot closes around the three of them like a steel trap. This is Lang at his most dispassionate.Scarlet Streetis a tour de force of noir filmmaking, brilliant and ice-cold.When it was made the film hit censorship problems, since at the time it was unacceptable to show a murder going unpunished. Lang went out of his way to show the killer plunged into the mental hell of his own guilt, but for some authorities this still wasn't enough, and the film was banned in New York State for being \"immoral, indecent and corrupt.\" Not that this did its box-office returns any harm at all.--Philip Kemp", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000PMFRW4", "B008K1PXIK", "B00023P4GA", "B0089LT800", "B000EXDSBG", "B0007ZEO8C", "B000B8384Q", "B00005RDRL", "B00AQ6J5YA", "B000EXDSBQ", "B00004W19C", "B009X919UE", "B004C2523M", "B0080JG2GE", "B0087ZG7OI", "B001SMC9L2", "B00BGARG3C", "B00E18QKJ2", "B00012L786", "B000087F79", "B00KMJBH7O", "B000B83846", "B00004W229", "B000CNE088", "B00007ELD1", "B00074DY0M", "B001CC7PM6", "B000244F2S", "B000B8380A", "B00005AUK9", "B0009X7682", "B000PMFRVU", "B00C3ALM02", "B000KJTGFG", "B001CC7PLW", "B00023P4FQ", "B0007TKNHY", "B005152C9G", "B006WQUGI2", "B00023P4II", "B00DBE97S8", "B0089LT7ZG", "B00EL6A7XE", "B0010KHOSU", "B0010KHOSA", "B00CVB6XF2", "B00I9BU60Q", "B006X0ZN3K", "B0024FAG8A", "B00065GX64", "B0006UEVVS", "B004VA0R7Q", "B0024FAG80", "B0006HBV3C", "B00007ELDG", "B004RA5AU4", "B00023P4G0", "B0006Z2NE0", "B00AEBBA7W", "B0000CNY4M", "B000LN6UHI", "B0007ZEO7S", "B0009X766O", "B00DZP1C9K", "B000244EWY", "B0009X7678", "B000BGH2N6", "B008BSM1CI", "6305999872", "B00006II5J", "B000FKO3VM", "6305770328", "B000M2E3GI", "B000244EZ6", "B00005AUKD", "B003ZYU3U0", "B00DBE98OG", "B00AB2NX1K", "B00D09AXUA", "B000244EWO", "B000PKG6OE", "B00004RER5", "B00I9BU3L8", "B000CNE08S", "B000244EYW", "B004VL1ERW", "B004A30AW6", "B000CNE08I", "B00008LDNZ", "B002945DUM", "B004LB5FEA", "B000MTEFOQ", "B00005Y70U", "B00I9BU3M2", "B00CUKTHES", "B000PKG7CU", "B000PKG798", "B0082LUEFA", "B000FI9OCW", "B00004XPPK"], "bought_together": ["B000PMFRW4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B008K1PXIK", "B00005RDRL", "B00E18QKJ2", "B000BGSY42"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 247692}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.0, "brand": "", "asin": "B00005YUN7", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510FQ0SS8EL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Scarlet Street"}
{"description": "The great Lord Peter Wimsey embodies amateur sleuthing at its best inHave His Carcase. Dorothy L. Sayers's impeccable plotting, wry humor, and touching fondness for her favorite characters all shine in this perfect adaptation of her novel. Wimsey's special friend Harriet Vane (Harriet Walter), fresh from a murder trial of her own, tries to get away from it all and ends up stumbling over a freshly killed body. Unable to resist a crime (or, for that matter, Harriet), Wimsey is soon on the case. Edward Petherbridge is perfect as Wimsey, revealing his brilliance and allowing him to be hopelessly in love without ever damaging his dignity. Walter plays Harriet with rich nuance, saying as much with her silences as she does with her lines. Most fun is Richard Morant as the astonishingly resourceful Bunting. The mystery spools out over four episodes, and very satisfyingly too.--Ali Davis", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000062XDY", "B000062XE0", "B000062XDX", "B00GWXI20E", "B00JJRLFTU", "B00BDSRM4K", "B002TY78PU", "B0038M2SBQ", "B000068UE9", "B001V7UXG2", "B00A0HT99G", "B00EV1YZD2", "B000VDDDVE", "B009DS6YGO", "B00F1BFRA6", "B000XUF6C4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000062XDX", "B00BDSRM4K", "B00A0HT99G", "B002TY78PU"]}, "price": 42.86, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 214726}, "asin": "B000062XDZ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5199F4A207L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Dorothy L.

{"description": "Mikhail Kalatozov's luscious portrait of love and loss during World War II stars almond-eyed beauty Tatyana Samojlova and handsome Aleksei Batalov as moony-eyed young lovers whose innocent romance is shattered by war. When the idealistic boy volunteers for service, his draft-dodging cousin steals the despondent girl by brute force, yet she never gives up on her true love, even when he's reported dead. Kalatozov's patriotic paean to fallen soldiers and home-front heroes is an undeniably sentimental melodrama suffused with lush images and lyrical sequences, a kind of cinematic poetry unseen in Soviet cinema since the experimentation and optimism of the silent days. Produced during the \"thaw\" following Stalin's repressive reign, it won the Palme d'Or prize at the 1958 Cannes Film Festival and set Kalatozov on the road to more ambitious expressions of Soviet idealism in the modern world, culminating in his masterpiece,I Am Cuba.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000633SB", "B00019G4TQ", "B006ML50YC", "B000UJ48Q8", "B000K2UEDG", "B0002KQOH6", "B006ML50S8", "B0000BWVCR", "6305257450", "B00280QNK6", "B000LV6OHQ", "6305744114", "B000V7HFL4", "B0019X3ZZO", "B00006JO77", "B00008ZZ9M", "B000I8OOHE", "B000RTCSIQ", "B000I8OOG0", "B000PKG6OO", "B00009MEKP", "B0000714AW", "B009RWRIMA", "B00092ZLEY", "B004NWPY20", "B00GA9F2PI", "B000093NR0", "B00005UQ7R", "B00005NFZB", "B000BB14I0", "B003VWR1XI", "B00006IUJ1", "B00005UQ7Q", "B004VH65A2", "B0000A02TX", "B00B2BYXWM", "B00HVOFP6W", "0780022343", "B000KRNGNQ", "B00F98FNNM", "B002U6DVQ2", "B0019T0JAW", "B000K0YLX2", "B00005JLV7", "B0000DGKI7", "B00004XQN5", "B001BEK8CE", "B003OXGW5M", "B00005M2C7", "B00B2BYXYA", "B00006LPEK", "B001MPS7GG", "6305131104", "B00F98FOFY", "B000093NR1", "B00HRISNPM", "B0000YEDM2", "B0002DB4YQ", "B00005QAPJ", "B004GNBBVO", "B004XVMCLC", "B000LTTOOS", "B00026L7MC", "0780020707", "B00005BHW6", "B0007989ZW", "B00A8QDHYW", "B0009UC7SE", "B006X96PBU", "0780023307", "B0011U3OA6", "B00HVOFP9O", "B0000714AX", "B001LMU19G", "B00003CXUM", "B00BY8U54S", "B00KE3B9US", "B00004W3HG", "B004WPYO7E", "B00007CVS3", "B00GPPXNLC", "B00009NHAT", "B000EANSXM", "B00B2BYXSQ", "B00IGK6TOM", "B00BX49B6G", "B00AQ6J3AG", "B000E5LEVA", "B005HK13S6", "B00DZP1BUU", "B00004Z1FM", "B004NWPY34", "B00393SFU2", "B00BX49BZM", "B001CW7ZSU", "0780021541", "B001TIQT7A", "B00005UQ7T", "B0087OULO6", "B005152CB4"], "bought_together": ["B0000633SB", "B00019G4TQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00019G4TQ", "B006ML50YC", "B000UJ48Q8", "B0000633SB"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 109238}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 24.86, "brand": "SAMOILOVA,TATIANA", "asin": "B0000633SD", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41J3BK4357L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Cranes are Flying (The Criterion Collection)"}

{"description": "Ranked by critics as one of Germany&#x92;s most important films,The Murderers Are Among Usoffers a wrenching look at history and humanity. The first feature film produced in Germany after World War II, it is set in Berlin just after the surrender, and the city is still being battered by air raids. The characters move through the half-destroyed husks of old buildings, and even simple acts like serving a meal at a table take on new meaning as the people try to put their lives back together. Susanne Wallner is a concentration camp survivor, eager to taste life again after her living death. Dr. Hans Mertens is a former German officer, unable to live with the guilt of what he and his former comrades have done. The two must quite literally learn to live side by side as they come to terms with the past and start to look toward the future. The film is beautifully and sensitively made, and possesses a shining optimism that is surprising for its time.--Ali Davis", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000JU7KCW", "B0013B34XA", "B000274THQ", "B00065GX64", "B0017ZGYR0", "B000021Y77", "B000E6ESS0", "B000GRU8TK", "B002KECJZ8", "B002IVDLGY", "B0030Y1282", "B000063UQT", "6305972761", "B000OVLBGC", "B0006IIKRQ", "1571134689", "B0040QYROA", "B002CS5NW8", "B0001VO38S", "B009XTF8NI", "B0009VND0E", "B0010YSDB8", "B00ID8H8EW", "B0009RCPUC", "B000U95NAI", "B000U95N9Y", "B0000646UM", "B00BSTVGHS", "0767802470", "B000093NQY", "B005HP2IYE", "B002BWP4A6", "B00GMV8B1G", "B00CVB6UXW", "B00006JMQG", "B002ZG8PXQ", "B008EXG6QC", "B0045ZAQSM", "B001DB6J82", "B00005QW59", "B00007L4I7", "6305301697", "B000JLIYRQ", "B000HD1MW0", "B0000WN10O", "B000BKVROM", "B002LFPBJW", "B00000F5KH", "0415420989", "B0006SJ3IQ", "B000H5V8H2", "B00EO2I6XS", "B0001FVDSM", "B0012QE4PI", "B000FVGNSM", "B002U6DVQ2", "B0007NMKVM", "B00HLSSC7M", "B000093NQZ", "B0049TC8CQ", "B006FE83T0", "B001KW90L2", "B002WBYDR6", "B008I34ZMA", "B000YKT4BW", "B005ARYF1S", "B0070YPWAW", "B000RXZIJS", "B00008978K", "B005HQBO9I", "B000P46QTA", "B0001US78G", "B00007CVS3", "B00792DYYQ", "B002EBRFA6", "1465400478", "B00IBKXS2I", "B00C2535TE", "B00I095JAY", "B000EZ9066", "6305081034", "0547863381", "B0063E00GQ", "B00005YUO1", "B001TH06TI", "B003BR8MEA", "B0007NMKVC", "0143039881", "B00AMHFO5C", "B0019Z3P66", "B0016AU882", "0814325602", "B0009WIE8Y", "B000G8P240", "B001DDBDIG", "B008I34YY4", "B0052WNHRY", "B000IHYXSU", "6304279388"], "bought_together": ["B000JU7KCW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000JU7KCW", "B004S2O8Z4", "B000E6ESS0", "B00699G65E"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 71113}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 21.13, "brand": "", "asin": "B000063UQS", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51S9D508HKL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Murderers Are Among Us"}

The year is 1941, and Rommel has the British in full retreat.  All that stands between him and the Suez Canal is the fortress of Tobruk, manned by a small army of Australian troops who are ordered to hold this vital position at any cost.  Many of the men are green recruits, and it falls to Capt. MacRoberts (Burton) to whip them into shape.  A bold tactician who realizes they will soon be overwhelmed if they do not take the offensive, MacRoberts leads countless daredevil raids that keep the superior enemy off-balance and earn his men the famous nickname they \"won with blood and bore with pride.\"  Directed by Robert Wise and co-starring James Mason in a reprise performance as Field Marshall Rommel (whom he first played in \"The Desert Fox\"), this stirring blend of action and history pays tribute to the heroic men known in the annals of war as The Desert Rats.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00008AOTO", "B000E5N6KW", "B00008AOTR", "B0001NBMH6", "B00096S4BM", "B00005PJ8K", "B0015S2OWI", "B00005OSJQ", "B000NTPG6Q", "B0007TKNGA", "B000H1RFSM", "B005HQBO9I", "B000A2WJBQ", "B004GSVXBW", "B000O78L0U", "0792841662", "B000NO1XJA", "B000EMGJFE", "B00005N5S3", "B005DTZXPA", "B00AEFXLKC", "B000MGBLIC", "B000MGTQ7U", "B0001NBMHQ", "B0001WTWWE", "B004IFYMXO", "B000062XEX", "B000EHSVSC", "B004VGHF7K", "B00005R23T", "B00005B1YH", "0792844017", "B00005ASGB", "B00005QCVP", "B00005JN9P", "B003AWRMCO", "B0029778T8", "B0007TKNLU", "B004IFYMXE", "B00AEFYBA6", "B00CHYSSME", "0792841670", "B00005B1YF", "B0001NBMGC", "B008A1TWXC", "B004XWGZBY", "B0005C9MQ6", "B0001NBMI0", "B00005JP3T", "0792839730", "B00008MTY1", "B004176JJY", "B000063URX", "B0001FVDIC", "B00BY0EBK0", "B005HQBO9S", "B00005PJ8S", "B000E0WJN2", "B000EHSVVO", "B00005PJ8L", "B000EHSVS2", "B00441GYYC", "B00096S4DA", "B0009UVCQW", "0792843576", "B004U7EIES", "B00008PC0Y", "B0000AMRUP", "B000ASDFHC", "B00005N5S2", "B004R6EFAO", "B0000639EI", "B00143XE0U", "B000CNESN0", "B000H1RFQ4", "B000U1ZV6M", "B0008ENHU8", "B000063URW", "B005DTZXL4", "B00004XPPC", "B00008AOTN", "B003B3NV5E", "B000EHSVVE", "B004R6EF9U", "B00008DDGW", "B00096S4BW", "B001PO556E", "B002DNLT1Q", "B000FZETR0", "B00008AOTM", "B000TLTCPO", "B0006B2A42", "B005DIA0IQ", "B000MRA542", "B000NTPG66", "B0002V8OAK", "B001PO55LE", "B000O599Z8", "B000O599VC", "B00008R9M6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000E5N6KW", "B00008AOTR", "B00008AOTO", "B0007TKNGA"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 132036}, "asin": "B000063US0", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/511M855JFNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Desert Rats"}

There's no shortage of suspects... until, that is, they also start dying off, obfuscating the investigation by suggesting that several killers may be at work. With a disciplined screenplay by Anthony Shaffer, the film is solid enough and is graced immeasurably by a glittery cast including Bette Davis, Maggie Smith, Mia Farrow, Olivia Hussey, Jack Warden, and Angela Lansbury. Directed with customary efficiency by John Guillermin (King Kong,The Towering Inferno).--Tom KeoghEvil Under the SunMostly for Poirot completists and admirers of then-trendy, all-star ensemble casts from the 1970s and early '80s,Evil Under the Sunfinds Peter Ustinov in his second outing as Agatha Christie's famous Belgian detective (three years after 1978'sDeath on the Nile). As the title promises, the action this time takes place on an Adriatic island (though Christie fans will surely balk at the switch from the novel's setting on the English coast), where a famous stage star (Diana Rigg) is murdered, and the list of likely suspects is unusually high. The parade of legendary performers--Roddy McDowall, James Mason, Sylvia Miles, Maggie Smith, Jane Birkin--plus Ustinov's energetic performance keep things hopping. But Anthony Shaffer's lazy screenplay and director Guy Hamilton's superficial approach nudge everything (action, characters, tone) toward campy, near-parody, with bitchy sniping, tacky costumes, and an obligatory soundtrack of Cole Porter tunes. It's only in the last lap that the film transcends such obviousness and finds its way back to the glories of detective fiction.--Tom KeoghThe Mirror Crack'dAngela Lansbury does the honors as Agatha Christie's determined sleuth, Miss Marple, in this adaptation of Christie's novel. A washed-up movie star (Elizabeth Taylor) is attempting to make a comeback but is driven to distraction by a mysterious event from her past. Also problematic for Taylor's struggling actress is a series of murders occurring with clockwork regularity in the quiet, 1950s English village where a film is being produced--killings that are all somehow connected to her. Despite the British backdrop, most of the suspects, including Rock Hudson, Kim Novak, and Tony Curtis, are American in this 1980 feature directed by Guy Hamilton (Evil Under the Sun). (At least Miss Marple's nephew, the redoubtable Inspector Craddock, is played by Edward Fox.) The bad news: this is a curiously flat, monotonous film, with a mystery hook that, sad to say, is among Christie's more familiar and predictable. Hamilton doesn't demand much of his largely ornamental cast, and they don't volunteer much to fill the void. Still, fans of Miss Marple and Christie, especially those with a burning hunger to see every film or television program based on the books, will want to check it out.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B001KP2J3U", "B001KZOVJK", "B001KP2J3K", "B00AEFYO5I", "B001KP2J44", "B000GB5M1U", "B000GB5M1A", "B00KMIOVBY", "B0047CG95W", "B00GAXASKS", "B007CBWXD2", "B000059LGD", "B00DW5IKWK", "B001CR49HU", "B00GWXI0S8", "B00005QBZL", "B003AND1TG", "B00GWXHYPI", "B0090XLDO0", "B0028AENVC", "B0013NAMGU", "B00008K772", "B003156IHA", "B00GAXASLC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001KP2J3U", "B001KZOVJK", "B001KP2J3K", "B00AEFYO5I"]}, "price": 9.14, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 160568}, "asin": "B00008DDWU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516AFHGGXNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Agatha Christie Mysteries (Death on the Nile / Evil Under the Sun / The Mirror Crack'd)"}
{"description": "S.W.A.T.crams onto a single DVD two commentary tracks, deleted scenes, featurettes, and excellent technical specs, including an exciting sound mix.  The first commentary track is a combination of informative but subdued remarks by director Clark Johnson spliced with a track by Samuel L. Jackson and five other actors (but not Colin Farrell) together.  The comments by the actors are infrequent, raucous, and forgettable. There's also a commentary track by four of the writers, who discuss how they were writingS.W.A.T.when the North Hollywood shootout (on which the opening scene is based) took place, and what writers think about actors who improvise. The making-of featurette gives plenty of exposure and credit to the real-life S.W.A.T. officers who helped with the film, and a featurette on the original TV series is interesting, even though it's basically an advertisement for theDVD set.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004H2P6II", "B00005JLX2", "B0015LPRZQ", "B0025KVKDO", "B00005JLQN", "B0001XAQ9Q", "B00005JL3K", "B000J4QWMC", "B000A2X3MU", "B002ZG99N6", "B00275EGWY", "B000FJGR76", "B002AT8K9W", "B000KX0HFK", "B00AEBB86A", "B004LGGXG4", "B001MZ5W3M", "B000G5SILC", "B001BP4K22", "B00004Z1FX", "B000QUCRB4", "B000HC2M2K", "6304806434", "B00003CXNY", "B000TJBN80", "B000KLQUSU", "0790736411", "B00HLTD3ZW", "1558908315", "B000VG66XS", "B00016MSV2", "B002ZG994U", "B004V8W52S", "B008E70EES", "B000065U1N", "B000X1Z0C4", "B0000VJG72", "B00004Z4WR", "B0007W7I4W", "0767803434", "B0010YVCB6", "B00005JKTP", "B0034G4OUO", "B00005QW6V", "6304698747", "B000K7UBSO", "B000FFL2G6", "B000F8DV1M", "B004EPYZUS", "B000274T94", "B00004STUL", "B002VWNIEA", "B000095WW8", "B00000FZL2", "B00ECXJBN8", "B0000B1OFL", "B00AEFY0XE", "B00562I40K", "0792835727", "B0009KA7XG", "B000BTITKS", "B000KGGIZK", "B00009ZPUA", "B0002IQMAM", "B0058ZPNBI", "B005LAIIPS", "B001QB9H10", "B001O5LVVC", "B001UV4XGA", "B004HO6HWA", "B00BUC4TJ0", "B00BEIYHO2", "B004P3ENLA", "B0006GANOQ", "B0019EXZY4", "B00000G3PA", "B0013J55B6", "B002GHHHL0", "B00004STDN", "B0009DWL8W", "6304711891", "B0034G4ORC", "B003Y5H5FG", "B00BB67UNW", "B001ILHY1I", "B004EPYZQC", "B002AT8KA6", "0790732149", "B00260HH2G", "B000CQLZ8S", "B005LAIH2C", "B002ZG97RE", "B003M987QK", "B000A0GP0Y", "B000KX0HIW", "B00009L1TA", "B00005V9I6", "0783240295", "B000P0J0BK", "B0000542CK"], "bought_together": ["B004H2P6II"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00008YLVB", "B000M341QE", "B005CFBYW6", "B003Q6D2B4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 24979}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.98, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B00008EYA5", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51BEAR8WT7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "S.W.A.T.

{"description": "Deep Space Nine's third season begins eventfully, with Sisko promoted to Captain and being given a prototype warship equipped with a cloaking device, while Odo learns where he came from. In the two-part opening tale, this clever gambit is played to hook viewers into the idea ofDS9becoming an ongoing mystery/conflict show. Why the sudden intense change in format? Mostly it was to ensure the show continued to thrive, when a rather greedy production hierarchy fast-trackedVoyageronto the air mid-season (cue unnecessary crossover episode with Tuvok). Of greater concern was ratings thiefBabylon 5, which played its counter-Trekcards at precisely the right time. Fortunately the result (initially at least) was a genuine boost forDS9.Cast members seemed to have hit their stride and played off one another more assuredly than before. For example, Odo's character took several additional interesting twists, especially in his relationship with Kira. Rene Auberjonois had a very good year, directing two episodes to boot. Avery Brooks had begun this trend with the previous year's penultimate show. The real surprise was seeing Jonathan Frakes's name working behind the camera on three occasions, because he also appeared on screen in his alternate rogue Riker role, when Thomas dramatically steals theDefiant. Other welcome cameos that aided the feeling of casual camaraderie included the return of Lwaxana Troi, as well as first appearances by Quark's mother, the spooky Founder Leader, the lovely Leeta, and the sneaky Eddington. Clint Howard--a cultTrekfigure--was briefly welcomed back, and with the many faces of Jeffrey Combs another was born. Stories advanced the complicated Bajoran/Cardassian healing process, while simultaneously brewing potential conflicts far worse than the behind-the-scenes ratings war.--Paul Tonks", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00008KGT0", "B00008972H", "B00008KA59", "B00008KA58", "B00005JLF5", "B00008KA57", "B000228EBS", "B0002JP4GE", "B0002WZTCA", "B00062IDLA", "B00062IDCO", "B000127LW2", "B0001NBNFW", "B0009I7NGW", "B000A6CLL0", "B000AOEMXC", "B00BHWG0DQ", "B0007TKH66", "B00BHWG0CM", "B000063V8R", "B000063V8T", "B000063V8S", "B000062XFG", "B00005Y1NF", "B00IURL19Y", "B00062IDDS", "B002BAW6FE", "B002BAW6FY", "B002BAW6GS", "B002BAW6H2", "B00BHWG0G8", "B004EXWGHY", "B00K2CHWYI", "B000HEWEJ4", "B002BAW6GI", "B00L4K3MLE", "B00BHWG1AI", "B001DHXT3Y", "B00KHA9BQ2", "B0017VG69U", "B00HETWFVC", "B000VDDDY6", "B002I9Z8GM", "B00B7VZN76", "B00HRUQAKU", "B00243FQFA", "B000BOH990", "B00006LPCK", "B000F8O2OM", "B000CNE0SS", "B00AZMFJYA", "B00FFEM0W2", "B00CKYHH6O", "B002HQKRBC", "B000I0QLR8", "B000BOH98G", "B00F6WXPSQ", "B00HCK7THS", "B001RHGRTS", "B000HDR814", "0671501062", "B00IO998U2", "B00ENFS0F0", "B002GP7ZW8", "B000B8IA2G", "145169590X", "6305761078", "B000F8O2Q0", "B002I9Z8GW", "B0019N95IK", "B0041B77RS", "B006LG74Q0", "B003Y7JWZ0", "B0095XPZBC", "B002GP7ZVY", "B00GSTHDCU", "146540337X", "B00IWTVDUW", "B000W4KT9G", "B000LC4ZI0", "B000AOEMXM", "B000F8O2P6", "B00005JM3A", "B001DF681G", "B000BNI90Y", "B000BOH986", "B004TJ1H3C", "B0000AUHOH", "B003L77GUG", "B002I9Z8I0", "B000F8O2OW", "B00402FGE4", "B005PPMHWE", "B000EHSVL4", "B002ZCY7TG", "B001EHF3RS", "B003H9LIU2", "B002HRF68A", "B007USE5CE", "B00018D3RI"], "bought_together": ["B00008KGT0", "B00008KA59"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00008972H", "B00008KA58", "B00005JLF5", "B00008KGT0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 40963}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 34.69, "brand": "Paramount", "asin": "B00008KA5A", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51P2M3YB3CL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Star Trek Deep Space Nine - The Complete Third Season"}
{"description": "Kate Hudson twinkles as the heroine of How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days. She's a magazine writer assigned to date a guy, make all the mistakes girls make that drive guys away (being clingy, talking in baby-talk and so on) and records the process like a sociological experiment. However, the guy she picks-- Matthew McConaughey--is an advertising executive who's just bet that he can make a woman fall in love with him in 10 days; if he succeeds, he'll win a huge account that will make his career. The set-up is completely absurd, but the collision of their efforts to woo and repel creates some pretty funny scenes. McConaughey's easy charm and Hudson's lightweight impishness play well together and the plot, though strictly Hollywood formula, chugs along efficiently.

{"description": "It was a family affair in the second season of J.J. Abrams's wonderfully inventiveAlias, as super secret agent Sydney Bristow (Jennifer Garner) came face-to-face with the mother of all super secret agents--herownmother, Irina Derevko (Lena Olin), a former KGB agent presumed dead but alive and more dangerous than ever. After shooting poor Syd, Irina later shows up at the doorstep of the CIA, offering to turn herself in and work for the good guys. But can she be trusted?Aliasset up so much duplicity in its second season that it might have been hard to keep track of who was doing what to whom, but thanks to a great ensemble cast, fast-paced writing and direction, and some cannily cast guest stars,Aliasrode a stunning emotional roller-coaster and never broke its momentum, even when halfway through the season, the show reinvented itself. With episode 13, \"Phase One\" (which aired after the Super Bowl to the show's biggest audience), Syd's original nemesis (and employer) SD-6 changes forever, yet the kick-butt agent still finds herself going up against the malevolent leader Sloane (Ron Rifkin) and his ever-changing set of henchmen. Action fans got plenty of fighting, while romanticAliaswatchers swooned as Syd and the dashing Vaughn (Michael Vartan) finally consummated their unrequited love.The critically acclaimed show owed a debt toBuffy the Vampire Slayerfor its mix of action, romance, mystery, and moral quandaries, but in this seasonAliastruly came into its own--with a climax that came as a total shocker and prepped the show for an emotionally volatile third season. Guest stars included the phenomenal Amy Irving as Sloane's wife, Faye Dunaway as a nefarious bigwig, Christian Slater as a kidnapped scientist, and Ethan Hawke as a fellow CIA agent (or rather, two of them), but it was the dysfunctional nuclear family of Syd, Irina, and father Jack (Victor Garber) that gaveAliasits heart and its strength, whether the three perfectly cast actors (all Emmy nominated) were just bickering or undertaking deadly hand-to-hand combat. And you thought your family had problems!--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001MVWRMK", "B001MVWRNE", "B001MVWRMU", "B001MVWRN4", "B0001I55ZQ", "B004SJU51I", "B00008ZL4Q", "B0047BXR8U", "B000O77SMW", "B00GTZWUPS", "B0047BXR9E", "B000O77SN6", "B003R4ZMQI", "B0079IEPHK", "B00005JNOG", "B000FIMG68", "B00L9FKMC6", "B0006UEVTK", "B00HUPC5X8", "B00KHA9BQ2", "B0047BXR30", "B000092T3Y", "B003UD7JEE", "B00BD6KXKW", "B00079FUI6", "B0051GOB2G", "B000TGURZ8", "B0018CWEYY", "B000P6YNSE", "B00HUCF7AO", "B00H57HOSC", "B00HEQOAIQ", "B000FFJYBQ", "B00E8OMZGG", "B001L5SRJE", "B000NDEXK2", "B0036EH3XE", "B006YG9HJE", "B0077PTWY6", "B001VPJZ0E", "B00133QNS6", "B003R0MEZO", "B003R0MEXQ", "B0019LY5IM", "B00B4804LM", "B000ICLRKC", "B000TM1CL0", "B0024FAR66", "B0077PTWHI", "B002KQ6UE2", "B00A8KJN8M", "B005FISC3Y", "B009LDD4V4", "B00915G6TE", "B000NOKFGW", "B004TJ1GY2", "B002NS2HBM", "B000QDLSR0", "B0009X76ZA", "B0018CWEZI", "B0060MYLCU", "B000FL7CAK", "B00062IDEW", "B002JVWRD6", "B003YF9Q08", "B001B7CNZ6", "B0001907BC", "B00B58948U", "B0013DZNAA", "B00B5ARKC0", "B00IWTVDUW", "B00170LCWC", "B002ZCY7SW", "B004YM6JVO", "B00JF5GAZA", "B009LDD1H6", "B000BZISRQ", "B001FACH7S", "B000NA2BEU", "B000FIMG4U", "B004SJN8XA", "B000ERVJLS", "B001AQMBJQ", "B0058YPJ8G", "B00BGQ2NIO", "B000MR8W92", "B00133QNRW", "B000SMNL92", "B001992NWO", "B004XM38CS", "B000MX7V66", "B0007P0Y7C", "B0012IXBNC", "B0053O8A46", "B00KS9V6EC", "B0006IUE16", "B003L77GZQ", "B000CNE0RO", "B00008YGRU", "B00CD45JBG"], "bought_together": ["B001MVWRNE", "B001MVWRMK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001MVWRNE", "B001MVWRN4", "B001MVWRMU", "B001MVWRMK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 56784}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 21.25, "brand": "Disney", "asin": "B0000ALF8I", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51aeA43SPJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Alias - The Complete Second Season"}
{"description": "As the 2005 theatrical release ofSerenitymade clear,Fireflywas a science fiction concept that deserved a second chance. Devoted fans (or \"Browncoats\") knew it all along, and with this well-packaged DVD set, those who missed the show's original broadcasts can see what they missed. Creator Joss Whedon's ambitious science-fiction Western (Whedon's third series afterBuffy the Vampire SlayerandAngel) was canceled after only 11 of these 14 episodes had aired on the Fox network, but history has proven that its demise was woefully premature. Whedon's generic hybrid got off to a shaky start when network executives demanded an action-packed one-hour premiere (\"The Train Job\"); in hindsight the intended two-hour pilot (also titled \"Serenity,\" and oddly enough, the final episode aired) provides a better introduction to the show's concept and splendid ensemble cast. Obsessive fans can debate the quirky logic of combining spaceships with direct parallels to frontier America (it's 500 years in the future, and embattled humankind has expanded into the galaxy, where undeveloped \"outer rim\" planets struggle with the equivalent of Old West accommodations), but Whedon and his gifted co-writers and directors make it work, at least well enough to fashion a credible context from the incongruous culture-clashing of past, present, and future technologies, along with a polyglot language (the result of two dominant superpowers) that combines English with an abundance of Chinese slang.What makes it work is Whedon's delightfully well-chosen cast and their nine well-developed characters--a typically Whedon-esque extended family--each providing a unique perspective on their adventures aboard Serenity, the junky but beloved \"Firefly-class\" starship they call home. As a veteran of the disadvantaged Independent faction's war against the all-powerful planetary Alliance (think of it as Underdogs vs. Overlords), Serenity captain Malcolm Reynolds (Nathan Fillion) leads his compact crew on a quest for survival. They're renegades with an amoral agenda, taking any job that pays well, butFirefly'scomplex tapestry of right and wrong (and peace vs. violence) is richer and deeper than it first appears. Tantalizing clues about Blue Sun (an insidious mega-corporation with a mysteriously evil agenda), its ties to the Alliance, and the traumatizing use of Serenity's resident stowaway (Summer Glau) as a guinea pig in the development of advanced warfare were clear indicationsFireflywas heading for exciting revelations that were precluded by the series' cancellation. Fortunately, the big-screenSerenity(which can be enjoyed independently of the series) ensured that Whedon's wild extraterrestrial west had not seen its final sunset. Its very existence confirms that these 14 episodes (and enjoyable bonus features) will endure as irrefutable proof Fox made a glaring mistake in canceling the series. --Jeff ShannonBeyondFireflyon DVDWatchStargate: Continuumon DVDCatch up onStargate Atlantison DVDCheck outSunshineon DVDStills fromFirefly(Click for larger image)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000BW7QWW", "B001M5UDGS", "B001KOFH2G", "B00E688AZE", "1593074492", "B002JVWR4U", "B0024FAR66", "B0006FO9B0", "1781161682", "B000AJJNFE", "1595821627", "1595825614", "B0000844I8", "B006URR9HY", "B0036EH3UC", "B002GP7ZWI", "1845760824", "B00061QJSK", "B000VY1EYG", "B000EHSVN2", "B00AZMFJYA", "B000BOH8Y6", "B000BLI4PQ", "B00FR23QNE", "B0081QF6Q8", "B00GT2TEPU", "B00KHWSB5M", "B000EHSVMS", "B004YPED14", "B0009JE6G6", "B004D92S9K", "B000FOPPBA", "B000EHSVLY", "B0090SI56Y", "B003PGNBO8", "B000EHSVM8", "B00ECR7KX2", "B001MT7ZEW", "B000F8O2PQ", "B000BNI90Y", "B002ZHKZGA", "B00FSKOFKS", "B002I9Z8I0", "B00129W6LE", "B0038M2APA", "B001AQO43M", "B00BM2JVAA", "B002GY9F9K", "B000QXDCJ2", "B0007CEXUY", "B001CQONMC", "B000RZIGVS", "B007D5E7C2", "B008YOLRDS", "B001XRLWPQ", "B00F3M3VSS", "B000SMNL92", "B008JFUPFI", "B000I0RQVI", "B004EPYZPS", "B001YYQA0K", "B005PPMHO2", "B0089AD8IO", "B000U7WV1Y", "B000B8IA2G", "B00E3QJ7JC", "B00COMH99W", "B004SMDJ9U", "B008H1Q61G", "B000BCCAEQ", "B000T9OP7G", "B005LAIH2W", "B0032UYFA6", "B006TBYC76", "B003F3NDWG", "B004H85K1K", "B0041T52S6", "B000LC4ZI0", "B008JFUNHI", "0062225758", "B004L9GMBC", "B0046XG48O", "B00DII0MGI", "B006TTC5WC", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B000QDLSR0", "B004EPYZU8", "B0016Q0HY6", "B001DJLCRC", "B003L77FYS", "B000U1ZV8K", "B00E8RKHWW", "0786891424", "B00J2MPZQG", "0792844890", "B00JAD6BYW", "B007ZXW3SM", "B00IXD2MGQ", "0786891432"], "bought_together": ["B000BW7QWW", "B001M5UDGS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000BW7QWW", "B005S9EK5Y", "B001M5UDGS", "B004LWZW42"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 918}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 12.99, "brand": "20TH Century Fox", "asin": "B0000AQS0F", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Q-uS67cjL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Firefly: The Complete Series"}

{"description": "For earthbound humans,Winged Migrationis as close as any of us will get to sharing the sky with our fine feathered friends. It's as if French director Jacques Perrin and his international crew of dedicated filmmakers had been given a full-access pass by Mother Nature herself, with the complete \"cooperation\" of countless species of migrating birds, all answering to eons of migratory instinct. The film is utterly simple in purpose, with minimal narration and on-screen titles to identify the wondrous varieties of flying wildlife, but its visceral effect is humbling, awesome and magnificently profound. Technically, Perrin surpasses the achievement of his earlier filmMicrocosmos(which did for insects what this film does for birds), and apart from a few digital skyscapes for poetic effect, this astonishing film uses no special effects whatsoever, with soaring, seemingly miraculous camera work that blesses the viewer with, quite literally, a bird's-eye view. A brief but important hunting scene may upset sensitive viewers and children, but doesn't stopWinged Migrationfrom being essential all-ages viewing.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B007C8RZWO", "B00GSDSQDQ", "B000BI5KV0", "B0000DZ3BS", "B009VRVGLK", "B005OAEWV4", "B004LWZWBU", "B000069HXL", "B0037X5BME", "B000BB1534", "B009B0L4H8", "B004CRR9FG", "B0043SS2DC", "B001UV4XW4", "B009DJB95E", "B003QF1N7K", "B00AEFXFNA", "B0014VPFQI", "B00005LK94", "B004ISVGZI", "B008WAM2PG", "B00BQI3Y7Q", "B00CBLP2T0", "B001RV53TE", "B00AKIPA52", "B00BGDCX0A", "B00GSDSRQW", "B00443FMIY", "B001W79MRW", "B003QF1NA2", "B0002B54QC", "B0006U6KIU", "B000XCK0MS", "069101633X", "B003ONR2WE", "B002RB56W2", "B0028ERBSA", "B005SH65TK", "0865475911", "0688166490", "B008V8NR8U", "B00IAR2DJG", "079225483X", "B0016I0AH8", "B001957A4E", "B00KAPHV0C", "B00AQ8IXRI", "B0036TGSW6", "B002EWD0CW", "0375709665", "0618756426", "B0000CBXZX", "0802715184", "B00FRQ0BA6", "B002NTDXOQ", "B00CPTUOI2", "B000056OZ5", "B0009XRZS8", "B0012YN5AK", "B003XMKU2A", "B00559SGKC", "B004PHSTWK", "B000MR9D5E", "B007C8RZU6", "B008XJM7KG", "B0009K7R1Q", "B00BQI49VG", "B003QF1NAM", "0199328749", "0691154821", "B00JXVNVRG", "0754821668", "B00AEFY9RG", "0762731346", "B006US3UQC", "1886679002", "B000024HL1", "B009NRQTKQ", "B002ZG974M", "B000JU7JE6", "B000LPS2TA", "B00BCV3IN2", "B00020HAWE", "6304698623", "B00000IQBE", "B00000K3TX", "B00004TJJV", "B005R2SHQA", "B000EBD9W6", "B001CDLAT4"], "bought_together": ["B007C8RZWO", "B00GSDSQDQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00GSDSQDQ", "B007C8RZWO", "B00BGDCX0A", "B000069HXL"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 73172}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 18.99, "brand": "", "asin": "B0000CGNEH", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51FSQ6AH0QL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Winged Migration (Special Edition)"}

{"description": "Even under the heavy censorship of 1946 Hollywood, Lana Turner and John Garfield's libidinous desires burn up the screen in Tay Garnett's adaptation of James M. Cain's torrid crime melodrama. Platinum blond Turner is Cora, a restless sexpot stuck in a roadside diner married to mundane middle-aged fry cook Nick Smith (Cecil Kellaway) when handsome drifter Frank (Garfield) blows her way. It's lust at first sight, a rapacious desire that neither can break off, and before long they're plotting his demise--but in the wicked world of Cain nothing is that easy. Garnett's visual approach is subdued compared to the more expressionistic film noir of the period, but he's at no loss when he films the luminous Turner in her milky-white wardrobe. She radiates repressed sexuality and uncontrollable passion while Garfield's smart-talking loner Frank mixes street-smart swagger and scrappy toughness with vulnerability and sincere intensity. Costar Hume Cronyn cuts a cold, calculating figure as their conniving lawyer, a chilly character that only increases our feelings for the murderous couple, victims of an all consumingamour fouthat drives their passions to extremes.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001KXZGNW", "B001KXZGOG", "B002GSXKPQ", "B0087ZG7OI", "B002GSXKQA", "B007FQXEVY", "B001KXZGO6", "079073219X", "B003UN2IAY", "B008D1Q1VU", "B008D1R52Y", "B005F265CU", "B005EVY8MQ", "B007FQXEQO", "B008D1R52E", "B00004XPPK", "B000FFJYAW", "B002VWNIAY", "B001D8W7EK", "B003UN2I4K", "B0047BXQZY", "B0045HCJ9E", "B0008ENIAC", "B0049985XW", "B00871C09S", "B004H83IFU", "B00406UJZG", "B00AEBB97S", "B006H37PXY", "B0080JG2GE", "B00023P4GA", "B00AEFXD1O", "B000BQ5IXW", "B00AEBBA7W", "B0001HAGTW", "B008D1Q1TM", "B000FFJYAC", "B000244EYW", "B00007ELD1", "B0045HCJHG", "B001D8W7EU", "B00AEBB89C", "B00AEFXRWO", "B004UOHNCA", "B00005A0QS", "B00DNQM7N6", "B00023P4II", "B000CC1TNI", "B000FFJYAM", "B002945DUW", "B000ECX0O2", "B0087ZG7R0", "B005H8G78O", "B003B3V0RA", "B000087F79", "B0086IMNRQ", "B001PO54V0", "B004XKVP7K", "B000244EWO", "B000B8384Q", "B0024FAG80", "B00006RCO1", "B000025RE7", "B006H37P2K", "B0007ZEO8C", "B00466JALY", "B000FFJYA2", "B00004W229", "B00DBE97S8", "B0050FXDDQ", "B00005RDRL", "B00027JYLM", "B00AMSQBNK", "B008BSM1XC", "B00008LDNZ", "B000CNE088", "B004UOHNAC", "B0006HBV3C", "B00553K8DQ", "B00005JKF6", "B00AEFXN9G", "B0008ENID4", "B00023P4FQ", "B0035Q636Q", "B000PKG7CU", "B0000549B0", "B00003CXBU", "B0047BXR1C", "B00012L786", "B006FE83UE", "B00006RCO2", "B00BQ412GU", "B001PO550A", "B000244F2S", "B000EXDSBQ", "B000PMFRVU", "B00AATGDW0", "B0006HBV28", "B003ZEQMH8", "B0006Z2NE0"], "bought_together": ["B001KXZGNW", "B001KXZGOG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001KXZGNW", "B003ZEQMH8", "B008D1Q1VU", "B005F265CU"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 36043}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.99, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B0000EYUCU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51CHTNvd9UL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Postman Always Rings Twice"}

{"description": "Partly inspired by 1948'sThe Big Clockand its nominal 1987 remakeNo Way Out, the Denzel Washington thrillerOut of Timeis quite enjoyable if you ignore its implausible plotting. Like those earlier films, this reunion of Washington and hisDevil in a Blue Dressdirector Carl Franklin is about a man--in this case the police chief (Washington) of sleepy Banyan Key, Florida--who falls into a trap set by others, sinks into legal quicksand of his own making, and must race the clock to extricate himself from a series of incriminating setbacks. The Florida setting adds welcome character to the potboiler plot, and Washington's screen-cred makes it easy to overlook the absurdities of rookie writer David Collard's screenplay. Eva Mendes is sharp and sensible as Washington's estranged wife (do you think they'll reconcile for a happy ending?), and the talented John Billingsley--whose portrayal of \"Dr. Phlox\" on TV'sEnterpriseis vastly underrated--is a constant delight as Washington's medical examiner, beer buddy and wily co-conspirator. It's hardly a classic, butOut of Timegoes well with a big tub of popcorn.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JPD0", "B000GFLKF8", "B00005JN0W", "B000244GCC", "B002LMV7R0", "6304884400", "B002VWNIEA", "B00005JKWX", "B000OT6V0K", "B005LAIGRS", "0783240295", "B0050MB4OO", "6304765258", "B00BTYOYG2", "B002ZG99TA", "B00005JA9F", "B0006210ZG", "B0000542CJ", "078324228X", "0767818075", "B002CPMB9O", "B002ZG997C", "B00AFEXRME", "B00441GZ1Y", "B002GHHHN8", "B00096S49Y", "B000N60HAO", "B00BEIYN9Q", "B005LAIGLE", "B002AT8K9W", "B00005JLRZ", "B00125WAWS", "B003BV8I3Q", "B0001VTPUO", "B008E70EES", "B0013J55B6", "B0007KZQAM", "B001JV5AZE", "B002O3Z4WK", "0800141806", "B000F8DV1M", "B002NZK5UU", "B00AEFXT1S", "B002AT8KAG", "B00BB67UNW", "B00J5G1P2W", "B002DU39GW", "B000G5SILC", "B00441GYXI", "0767810872", "B000ZS8GWQ", "B008FCX2D2", "B00AEBB86A", "B00008EYA5", "B00DZP1C2W", "B001UV4XRY", "0790730979", "6305428115", "0790736411", "6305161933", "B0006GAI5U", "B00BEIYHO2", "B008B9JTLI", "0783229402", "B001KRVLCI", "B003L20IG0", "B008JFUNKU", "B00AEBB8LA", "B00JA3RVG4", "B000VG66XS", "B0006GANOQ", "B00009L1TA", "B000R4SMCW", "B005OK721G", "B000EGDB10", "B00HEPC0TS", "B001L57ZYM", "B000069HZP", "B000P0J0EM", "B00007AJG1", "B00015YVDG", "6305505802", "B00005JMWP", "B004EPYZP8", "B00AEFXX9Q", "B000RO9Q7W", "B000244GCW", "B007EQR0D8", "B00J2MPZQG", "B00005JN0T", "B000QXDCLU", "B000P0I4O4", "B00005JNQA", "B005FUTBWS", "B00005JKQS", "0790742004", "B005YFGJFG", "B0002J4X2K", "B000N3SRO0", "B00013RC66"], "bought_together": ["B00005JPD0", "B00005JN0W"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005JN0W", "B00005JKWX", "B00005JPD0", "B000GFLKF8"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 29468}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.98, "brand": "Mgm/Ua Studios", "asin": "B0000VJG72", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51bhUc7kE0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Out of Time"}

Now, there were a few good movies and many follies born of the epic marriage of Burton and Taylor;Faustusis one of their most curious progeny. Alas, Burton's performance is hardly scaled back from a big, bellowing stage turn, while elsewhere the film fails to work up the most rudimentary cinematic life. And Liz? She keeps appearing, wordlessly, as a sexed-up dream temptation for poor Faustus, and finally as Helen of Troy, of \"Is this the face that launched a thousand ships?\" fame.

While the widescreen artistry is often brutal, it is also breathtaking, especially in a fantastic chase sequence involving train cars. Besides Jackman, several actors from the feature lend voices to their cartoon counterparts, including Robbie Coltrane (as Hyde), Alun Armstrong (as Cardinal Jinette), and David Wenhman (as sidekick Carl).

{"description": "Two pretty high school girls (one a cheerleader!) don't like their mother or her new boyfriend (\"Daddy would have gotten us Uzis!\"). One morning, they wake up to find that everybody in Los Angeles has been turned to dust by a Comet except them, a guy who looks like Erik Estrada, some zombies and the occupants of a secret underground government installation. Written by Mark Logan Two girls from the Valley wake up to find that a passing comet has eradicated their world and left behind a mysterious red-dust and a pack of cannibal mutants. With the help of a friendly truck driver, the girls save the earth from a villainous \"think tank,\" karate chop their way through flesh-eating zombies, and, of course, find time to go to the mall. Written by Jaime Kidwell\n\nTwo sisters, high school seniors in the early 1980s, awaken one morning to blood red skies and the realization that the human race has been wiped out. It becomes apparent that anyone who was not surrounded by steel when the Earth recently passed through the tail of Haley's comet has been reduced to a pile of red ash (the trace elements of human chemical makeup.) They encounter a rebellious Native American man and take over the air waves at a local radio station in an attempt to get help. Unfortunately, they attract the attention of a group of scientists who knew what the effects of the comet would be. They hid underground in a steel laboratory, but idiotically left the vents open. Now, as various survivors of the comet who were only partially surrounded by steel are decaying into flesh-hungry zombies, the scientists are attempting to come up with a vaccine made of the blood of people who were not infected by the comet. Thus the trio must fight their way past not only roving packs of the cannibalistic dead, but also outsmart a pack of scientists desperate not to become that way themselves.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B003JIPN20", "B003PIUINI", "6300182355", "0792845684"], "also_viewed": ["B002KPUN0K"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 232523}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 24.95, "brand": "", "asin": "B0001GV4PI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41101R6Z2KL.jpg", "title": "Night of the Comet"}

{"description": "Here's where it all began. The first season ofSurvivordominated the ratings in the summer of 2000, helped spur the reality-TV craze, and inspired countless water-cooler jokes about getting voted off the island.  The first season established the formula that would continue, with sometimes surprising variations, over numerous subsequent seasons:  16 people intended to represent the American mosaic are stranded far from civilization (in this case, the island of Pulau Tiga, off the coast of Borneo), struggle for food and shelter, compete in a series of physical and mental challenges, and at the end of each three-day episode vote out one of their fellow contestants.  After 39 days, the one sole survivor who is able to outwit, outplay, and outlast the others wins a million-dollar prize. Because theSurvivorcraze preceded the craze for complete-season DVD boxed sets, the first season was represented on DVD and video by a 150-minute highlights package calledSeason One: The Greatest and Most Outrageous Moments.  Now, all 13 episodes are available in a five-disc set (the fifth disc is...Outrageous Moments) that contains every challenge, every political maneuver, every next-episode preview and previous-episode recap, every tribal council including the famous finale, and the reunion show.  If you started watchingSurvivorin the Australian Outback or later, this is the perfect opportunity to see how host Jeff Probst, scheming Richard Hatch, tough truck driver Sue Hawk, ex-Navy SEAL Rudy Boesch, athletic Kelly Wiglesworth, and the others got the ball rolling.  If you did watch the first season, here's your chance to relive it, and you also get an enthusiastic group commentary by host Jeff Probst (poking fun at himself) and contestants Hatch (talking the most, which should surprise no one), Boesch, and Gervase Peterson on the first and last episodes, plus some minor featurettes (seven minutes of footage of the contestants leaving L.A. for Borneo, David Letterman's Top 10 featuring the contestants, and 10 minutes of new interviews with Hatch, Boesch, and Peterson).  Many reality shows have come and gone in the meantime, but in terms of staying fresh over a long run,Survivorhas outwitted, outplayed, and outlasted them all.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0007TKGVC", "B00005JOAQ", "B000BTGY2I", "B0002ERWV4", "B000FSME38", "B000HWZ4M0", "B005FRACYM", "B007PK88AW", "B007PK88HA", "B000Q7ZOMQ", "B004DNXIHM", "B000N6TYQC", "B00GHXYN52", "B00GHXYKV4", "B00KGKDWR2", "B000A6T1JK", "B00KGKDXQW", "B00005N89A", "B000BDGW94", "1933771054", "B00KHB3GSK", "B007HPMODM", "B00I5YBJ5S", "B00KY9N0S6", "B00L5KORSA", "B00I5YB6N8", "B004D4Y3IE", "0142424242", "B00KHB4CAG", "B003HOJ27S", "B005Y3SR0S", "B005Y3SR8A", "B002DQSKME", "B001T8M9LU", "B007HPNIL4", "B00C3MOUIG", "B0026RLMAC", "B00GOYHTB4", "B00CS3P8WM", "B004STBF2G", "B00C3MOUQI", "B001TKJDIU", "B004AUP3GW", "B00AL3HHWA", "B0064S91MK", "B00BN0WQ5I", "0142424269", "B00IWTVDUW", "B00ESFYY78", "B00005JLFT", "B0040QTNSA", "B002W1HBK2", "B00BYS0S72", "B001FFBI9G"], "bought_together": ["B0007TKGVC", "B00005JOAP"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0007TKGVC", "B0002ERWV4", "B00005JOAQ", "B000BTGY2I"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 31328}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 16.99, "brand": "Paramount Home Video", "asin": "B0001ZDKXI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51OYdMyXG3L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Survivor - The Complete First Season"}

{"description": "Johnny Depp gets high off another acting challenge in this tricky adaptation of aStephen King yarn. Although the mood is too sinister to allow for the mischief of hisPirates of the Caribbeanturn, Depp still manages to embroider his role here with plenty of quirky business. He plays a writer, depressed and nearly divorced, who's stuck in an isolated cabin (shades ofThe Shining) when a stranger (John Turturro) arrives, accusing him of plagiarism. Writer-director David Koepp (Stir of Echoes) does his best to make the rickety material compelling--he gets the maximum out of the cabin set, for instance--but the problems inherent in the King story eventually win out. The climactic scenes are particularly unpleasant, especially in contrast to the cleverness of Depp's performance. A Philip Glass score adds class, but this one ultimately feels like a disappointment.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00006JDU8", "B000NQRR1Q", "B00000IRE6", "B00005R87R", "B000F7CECK", "B002QEHPQU", "B00AEBBA72", "B00AEBBAEK", "B00AEBB9F0", "B006ISJQ1W", "B004A8ZWSS", "B004P7CNC2", "B001EZE5BU", "0780628551", "B0000VD04M", "B0000WN140", "0780621611", "B0009UZG0K", "B008QE9XD2", "B004SIP7PS", "B00004XPPB", "B00003CXWV", "B00092ZLSK", "B0000AC8LI", "B000053VAZ", "B000TJ6PBK", "B0007NFMB2", "B000N2HDJQ", "B00005UQ9V", "B001I04QCO", "B001HN69AY", "B001HN694K", "0792846443", "B004SIP6BI", "B000G1R39E", "B00003CXRG", "B0000C2IQQ", "B00AEBBA2W", "B000053UIF", "B006J8NPAE", "B000OYC7BW", "B00005JM5E", "0792841328", "0783229526", "6305120021", "B00C888MJ8", "B000GBEWRU", "0767821599", "B000BB1MI2", "B000FDEV3Y", "B00008EY9G", "B0002O7XW2", "B0009IOR6Q", "B00006FDCU", "B0053TWVDC", "B000U7WV1Y", "B00AEBB91E", "B0007WFXNA", "B00005JNY3", "B000U1ZV6W", "B00000F3SB", "B00005JN2Z", "0451213599", "B004SIP92O", "B000I0RQVI", "B00AEBB91O", "B00J5JSV3A", "B001A50716", "B000HT386M", "B00AEFYV9W", "1573625779", "1573626910", "B00F84H73Q", "B00AEBB8NI", "B000063US5", "B002NZK5SM", "B0010X73ZG", "B0002DB54A", "B00A1AU72A", "B00005JLQN", "B000C3L27U", "B005COPWZW", "B00009W5CA", "B0001GOH6Q", "630523650X", "B0002A2VK0", "B00AEFYYH6", "6305432317", "B00FYV7WCY", "B000GYI340", "B008R65Y28", "B000068IES", "B00005JNNT", "B000A2UBN4", "B0053TWV46", "B00011CZRE", "B0021L8UXA", "079284646X", "B00006FDCD"], "bought_together": ["B000NQRR1Q", "B00006JDU8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0012Q7M02", "B00AEBBAEK", "B00011CZRE", "B00AEBBA72"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 24136}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 19.99, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B0002234LS", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/412W5xnNliL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Secret Window"}
{"description": "The 1963 movie stars John Wayne in an unusual Western. Many of the past cultural cliches have been reversed, as if it is a parody of earlier movies. You can recognize parts of earlier movies (the spanking scene from \"The Quiet Man\". Big landowner McClintock is not out to exploit the new homesteaders over their lack of water. In fact, he warns them about these conditions. [He would lose these grazing lands.] So how does grass grow on the Mesa Verde? This story seems to be patched together from earlier movies, as if it was produced as a quick money maker. [Wayne's \"The Alamo\" was not a success.] The unintentionally funny part is where this 19th century land baron talks about creating parkland from his estate! I found this to be anachronistic. Would McClintock really own a large brick house in the middle of nowhere whose interior was clean like some city home? How many servants were needed to maintain it?\n\n\"The American West of John Ford\" is a tribute to this famous movie director who won many Hollywood Oscars, none for a Western. John Wayne, Jimmy Stewart, and Henry Fonda talk about their movies. It provides a summary of John Ford's movies. Western movies became part of American culture. Some people today talk about \"Dodge City\" as a bad example of gunfights when in fact they had gun control for visiting cowboys. A cowboy was a hired rural worker whose lot was not envied by most people. They were unskilled labor used by big cattle barons for seasonal work. Since there were no railroads in Texas (then), their job was to herd cattle over hundreds of miles to the railroad stations in Kansas.

{"description": "It looked like a standard teen soap on the outside, but once you scratched the surface of the glittery, sun-dappled Fox dramaThe O.C., you'd find underneath a number of surprisingly well-developed characters, fun plots that played around with their soap conventions, and some of the wittiest dialogue this side of an Aaron Sorkin show. The setup was pure high concept: hunky, brooding Ryan (Benjamin McKenzie) was a good kid from Chino starting to go bad, and thanks to the interference of his lawyer, Sandy Cohen (Peter Gallagher), finds himself whisked away from the wrong side of the tracks to the mansions and manicured lawns of Orange County. Soon, Ryan finds himself living in the Cohens' pool house, involved with troubled rich girl Marissa (Mischa Barton), and bristling against the societal confines of his new home, as the people may be richer but they're just as screwed up as anyone else. Still, somehow, he manages to bring out the humanity of the superficial people around him, and they become all the better for knowing him.Okay, enough with theBeverly Hills, 90210scenario--whatThe O.C.turned out to be was the most addictive TV soap in recent memory, and one with a brain to boot. Smarter thanMelrose Place, sexier than90210, funnier thanFelicity, and not as enamored of itself asDawson's Creek,The O.C.reveled in clever and hilarious dialogue (the pilot episode earned a WGA nomination) and quirky, eccentric characters. Most noteworthy was breakout star Adam Brody, who as Ryan's geeky newfangled brother-type Seth practically stole the teen heartthrob mantle away from Russell Crowe-lookalike McKenzie. Barton was a bit of a blank as the troubled Marissa, but her best pal, the blissfully superficial Summer, was played by Rachel Bilson as the perfect supporting character in a dizzy farce.

{"description": "A cross between a KosherShaftandAirplane!'s shameless gag machine,The Hebrew Hammeris an unabashed burlesque about a streetwise Jewish private detective (a \"circumcised dick\" in his own parlance) named Mordechai Jefferson Carver (Adam Goldberg). Once ostracized by Gentile children, Mordechai has become a much-feared defender of Jews, so extreme that even the militant Jewish Justice League tosses him out. Until, that is, JJL leader Chief Bloomenbergansteinhal (Peter Coyote) and his lovely daughter Esther (Judy Greer) recruit him to take on the wicked Damien (Andy Dick), a snippy anti-Semite who murders Santa Claus in order to turn Christmas into a Jew-hating holiday. Written and directed by Jonathan Kesselman, this sporadically funny feature is based on a funkier short (included on this DVD) of the same name. The cast is better than the generally obvious material, and Nora Dunn (as Mordechai's mother) and Mario Van Peebles are very good in supporting roles.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000FWHVL4", "B006ZL1PMU", "B000BYA4J2", "B0000C8ROV", "B00363WGF0", "B00003CXHG", "B001DPHDB0", "B00IUOH1EG", "B000071ZZJ", "B000JLQPZE", "B001DPHD9C", "B002BWP3W0", "B00000J122", "B00BX49CME", "B002DHACSS", "B00H96KG2U", "0843172452", "B000BGH2M2", "0452296447", "B0083H6AWE", "B00DSAUN9M", "B004HJ0ZTQ", "0767821513", "B006GQTYCC", "B0038ZHX9K", "B000FKVOEQ", "B000RPCK2E", "B000KG4BD6", "B000056HP4", "B000J09LH4", "B00005V4XW", "B006OT0UUQ", "0671034812", "B004XM38CS", "B0015OKWKI", "B000C3L2NE", "B001E75QHU", "B0001EFTVA", "B0089AJELY"], "bought_together": ["B000FWHVL4", "B006ZL1PMU"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000FWHVL4", "B006ZL1PMU", "B0000C8ROV", "B000BGH2M2"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 73696}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 7.0, "brand": "Paramount Home Video", "asin": "B0002WZTQQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51EG8rXufTL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Hebrew Hammer"}
{"description": "The seventh and final season ofBuffy the Vampire Slayerbegins with a mystery: someone is murdering teenage girls all over the world and something is trying hard to drive Spike mad. Buffy is considerably more cheerful in these episodes than we have seen her during the previous year as she trains Dawn and gets a job as student counselor at the newly rebuilt Sunnydale High. Willow is recovering from the magical addiction which almost led her to destroy the world, but all is not yet well with her, or with Anya, who has returned to being a Vengeance demon in \"Same Time, Same Place\" and \"Selfless,\" and both women are haunted by their decisions.Haunting of a different kind comes in the excellent \"Conversations with Dead People\" (one of the show's most terrifying episodes ever), in which a mysterious song is making Spike kill again in spite of his soul and his chip. Giles turns up in \"Bring on the Night\" and Buffy has to fight one of the deadliest vampires of her career in \"Showtime\". In \"Potential\" Dawn faces a fundamental reassessment of her purpose in life.Buffywas always a show about female empowerment, but it was also a show about how ordinary people can decide to make a difference alongside people who are special. And it was also a show about people making up for past errors and crimes. So, for example, we have the excellent episodes \"Storyteller\", in which the former geek/supervillain Andrew sorts out his redemption while making a video diary about life with Buffy; and \"Lies My Parents Told Me,\" in which we find out why a particular folk song sends Spike crazy. Redemption abounds as Faith returns to Sunnydale and the friends she once betrayed, and Willow finds herself turning into the man she flayed. Above all, this was always Buffy's show: Sarah Michelle Gellar does extraordinary work here both as Buffy and as her ultimate shadow, the First Evil, who takes her face to mock her. This is a fine ending to one of television's most remarkable shows.--Roz Kaveney", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000EHSVMS", "B000EHSVM8", "B000EHSVLY", "B000EHSVLE", "B000EHSVL4", "B000EHSVKK", "B000I0QLRS", "B000I0QLQY", "B000I0QLS2", "B000I0QLR8", "B000I0QLRI", "B007H9CNOI", "B003YF9Q08", "B000HD1482", "B0009W5J4Q", "B0006IUE16", "B002JVWR4U", "B000B5XOW0", "1593078226", "B00466H3CW", "B000CCBCGM", "B005CM1IIE", "B000GG4Y6O", "B000ERVJM2", "B006LG74Q0", "B00AMDA2QC", "B000JLTRIG", "B00344EAQO", "B00006J3WH", "B0024FAR66", "B0000AQS0F", "B000O77SMW", "B003R4ZMN6", "1595825584", "B000OIOPHC", "B000X5SPBI", "B000BOH98G", "B001FB4W0C", "B00243FQFA", "B00001R3O1", "B000BOH990", "B00076ONT6", "B000BOH986", "B00K0D9760", "B000CNE0SS", "B002U8XW9Q", "B0009HI5KQ", "B001BN4WL8", "B0002XVKMM", "B000EXDS34", "B000O77SN6", "B009LDCXNY", "B001MVWRNE", "B00HEQOAIQ", "B00511N79O", "B0017MO11O", "B0010YSD7M", "1595826106", "B0006GAOP4", "B00133QNRW", "1595823425", "1595829229", "1595821651", "0789326302", "B000QDLSR0", "B00IKM5LXG", "B003L77G8I", "B0009JE6FC", "B003TNW030", "B000FP2OPY", "B0024FAD9C", "B000RO6JYK", "B000VDDE0E", "B009LDD4V4", "1595824154", "B000CNE0TC", "B001MVWRNO", "B000095ZH2", "B002JVWRAO", "B000EXDS3E", "1595828885", "159307963X", "B00JF5G8WU", "B000A5045Q", "B0024FAR6G", "B009LDCWWG", "B000CNE0T2", "B0000844I8", "B000R7GKQE", "B00005Y1NF", "B001ULDJU6", "B003KW7CQ0", "B00BEJL6JK", "B001B7CNZ6", "B001992NWO", "B000FL7CAK", "B0006J28E6", "B004V8W4YM", "B000P0I4P8", "B005PPMHO2"], "bought_together": ["B000EHSVMS", "B000EHSVM8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000EHSVMS", "B000EHSVM8", "B000EHSVLY", "B000EHSVKK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 154931}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 19.98, "brand": "", "asin": "B0002XVKMC", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51C7GTP7R4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Buffy the Vampire Slayer - The Complete Seventh Season"}
{"description": "Home Movies: Season Oneis a television treasure that almost wasn't. After five episodes in 1999, the bright and sometimes brilliant animated satire was yanked from UPN's schedule and was rescued by Cartoon Network's late-evening \"Adult Swim\" programming, where it thrived for a few more seasons. Created by Loren Bouchard and Brendon Small (who provides the autobiographical voice of the show's 8-year-old hero, Brendon Small),Home Moviesconcerns the angst-ridden adventures of a fatherless boy who can't quite handle typical childhood challenges (school, sports) but, in his stumbling way, is advancing toward his dream of becoming a filmmaker and actor. With a manner and voice suggesting a cross between David Spade and Woody Allen, Brendon struggles--sometimes with sardonic wit, sometimes with heartbreaking candor--to protect his shaky sense of personal security while also trying to be taken seriously as an artist.Brendon lives with his single mom, Paula (wonderfully played by Paula Poundstone until episode 6, when she was replaced by the equally effective Janine Ditullio), whose own neuroses peak during some very funny moments. Among these is a school meeting that finds her removing her sweater and spouting a string of obscenities, a writing class that ends repeatedly in make-out sessions with a nameless slinger of sexy doggerel, and a disastrous date with Brendon's soccer coach, a hefty bully and all-around loser, John McGuirk (H. Jon Benjamin). McGuirk is Brendon's foil throughout the series, a drunk with rage problems and dubious ethics who often leans on the young hero as a confidante when he isn't making the poor kid run extra laps. The show's dialogue comes fast, biting, and painfully honest, characters frequently talk at the same time, and some of the best material is in the short dramas that Brendon tapes with friends Melissa (Melissa Bardin Galsky) and Jason (also H. Jon Benjamin).Home Moviesis not to be missed by anyone who enjoys urbane comedy, animated or otherwise.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00080ZFYS", "B000AXWX70", "B000EQ5PT6", "B000ABKHZC", "B0001MZ7K0", "B000ARXF7I", "B0007CILMA", "B00K8HAJN8", "B0000AQS89", "B000FO0AG0", "B00775R45A", "B00097DY2U", "B0000AQS81", "B000GIXLWA", "B000UX6TIY", "B000B5XOR0", "B00008EY6Q", "B00CO8WWS4", "B0002WZRSG", "B00H3JJCW8", "B0001MZ7KA", "B00069L0Z4", "B00GSSD73K", "B000FO0AFQ", "B000P2A6CA", "B00069L0YU", "B000EBGE9Q", "B00330WP6Q", "B000VWX6SA", "B0056EBHEI", "B0007CILMK", "B001G7Q640", "B000M341RS", "B004U7MQW4", "B00005JPP2", "B00116GEKW", "B001L1S1R6", "B0002WZRTU", "B000PAAJZG", "B001EOQVA4", "B004RCGQSC", "B000FSME2Y", "B007CO5MVE", "B00AKGG828", "B000KWZ1PC", "B000WW1YME", "B000EMGIDC", "B00005JM3G", "B000G6BL88", "B000CSUNMK", "B004DMIISM", "B007KFZ87S", "B000GG4Y1Y", "B000S76LKI", "B001B9LWME", "B0019CLMW8", "B001FT4PF6", "B000CNESM6", "B000RO6JZY", "B0019N8P2W", "B007KFZ88M", "B002JVWQYG", "B00AIANIPQ", "B0001ZWLVU", "B00BTRKMNI", "B001G0MFFG", "B002VWNIDQ", "B008412UKA", "B007KFZ7YM", "B001DZOD7C", "B000KLQUMQ", "B000RW3VDE", "B000AQ68VO", "B007KFZ8AA", "B00BUAMQS8", "B002SF9YSE", "B000BQPC42", "B00023P49C", "B00C7E3E7S", "B00BI7ZAM2", "B00018YCIM", "B000RZGHT6", "1451662076", "B0007PAM06", "B001L1S1PI", "B001D2WUCK", "B000HT3P6U", "B000RBA6CO", "B0001I9Y8U", "B000ERVJNG", "B000GETU2E", "B0007GADU4", "B00005KH30", "B004MWLXTO", "B00DOZNH58", "B007KFZ8B4", "B009TT0A1W", "B003VVBZ7W", "B0038M61D2", "B000M7XRC4"], "bought_together": ["B000ABKHZC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001D2WUCK", "B000AXWX70", "B00080ZFYS", "B00008EY6Q"]}, "price": 31.44, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 62357}, "asin": "B0002YCVY2", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51NAADZG7QL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Home Movies - Season One"}
{"description": "Carniv&#xE0;ledoesn't waste any time making its--wildly ambitious--aims clear. As carnival manager Samson (Michael J. Anderson,Twin Peaks' diminutive backwards-talker) notes in pilot episode \"Milfay,\" directed by Rodrigo Garc&#xED;a (son of Gabriel Garc&#xED;a Marquez), \"To each generation [is] born a creature of light and a creature of darkness.\" With that the story begins. The year is 1934, the setting the Oklahoma dustbowl. In short order, Ben Hawkins (In the Bedroom's Nick Stahl) loses his mother and his home. He's poor, he's alone--he needs a job. So he joins Samson's carnival, en route to the West. Hawkins, naturally, is the good guy. Waiting for him in California is the not so good Brother Justin Crowe (Clancy Brown,The Shawshank Redemption), a fire and brimstone preacher with supernatural powers and a fiercely loyal sister (Amy Madigan). Hawkins, as it turns out, has similar powers....Created by Daniel Knauf (Wolf Lake),Carniv&#xE0;lefeels like David Lynch (weird, slow, occasionally kinky), plays likeAmerican Gothic(Shaun Cassidy's cult series about a good kid and an evil sheriff), and looks like John Ford'sGrapes of Wrath. It features one of television's most colorful casts of characters. They include Sophie (Clea DuVall), who reads fortunes--with her comatose mother's assistance, the vaguely sinister Lodz (Patrick Bauchau), blind absinthe-drinker and mentalist (he can see both the future and the past), and Ruthie (Adrienne Barbeau), snake charmer, strongman's mother, and all-around maternal figure.

{"description": "Adam (Leigh Whannell) wakes up in a dank room across from Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes) and the body of a guy who has blown his own brains out. Not a happy place, obviously, and it gets worse when both men realize that they've been chained and pitted against one another by an unseen but apparently omniscient maniac who's screwing with their psyches as payment for past sins. Director James Wan, who concocted this grimy distraction with screenwriter Whannell, has seenSevenand any number of other arty existential-psycho-cat-and-mouse thrillers, so he's providedSawwith a little flash, a little blood, and a lot of ways to distract you from the fact that it doesn't make a whole hell of a lot of sense. Wan and Whannell (who's not the most accomplished actor, either) pile on the plot twists, which after some initially novel ideas become increasingly juvenile.

{"description": "Once in awhile a show comes along that breaks the mold. Most such programs fail, butJoan of Arcadiaset out to do something new, beat the odds, and found an audience. Created by Barbara Hall (Judging Amy), it&#x92;s a unique hybrid ofMy So-Called Life,The Commish, and--well, something different. Unlike CBS predecessorTouched by an Angel, faith creates more questions than answers (and God even has a sense of humor).Joan (Amber Tamblyn) is an ordinary 16-year-old. Father Will (Joe Mantegna) is the local Arcadia police chief, mother Helen (Mary Steenburgen) is a teacher/administrator, younger brother Luke (Michael Welch) is a fellow student, and older brother Kevin (Jason Ritter, son of John Ritter) is a high school graduate who was paralyzed the year before. He used to be popular and athletic. Now he watches TV and builds models. In the pilot, God speaks to Joan for the first time, as a cute boy, and asks her to get a job. Once she's convinced He's really God, she does. Her action inspires Kevin to get one, too, and his process of rejoining the world begins.As in Joan Osborne&#x92;s theme song, \"One of Us\" (featured on two episodes), God will continue to appear to Joan in a variety of guises--even as a dog walker who looks like Russ Tamblyn (Amber's father). He&#x92;ll often ask her to do things that make her uncomfortable, but she'll always learn from the experience and some good will always come from it. Unfortunately, she isn't able to talk to anyone about this or they'd think she was crazy, not even friends Grace (Becky Hahlstrom) or Adam (Christopher Marquette). By the season finale, faith will be replaced by doubt, setting the scene for the second season, in which Joan&#x92;s faith will be restored.--Kathleen C.

{"description": "Although it's technically a feature film, Isao Takahata'sMy Neighbors the Yamadas(1999) plays like a series of comedy sketches or sitcom episodes. The Tokyo household of Takashi and Matsuko Yamada includes their son and daughter, Noboru and Nonoko, Matsuko's cranky mother Shige, and their lumpish dog. Stolidly middle-income and middle-class, the Yamadas have a family life that falls somewhere betweenMarried... with ChildrenandThe Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet. Affectionate but undemonstrative, they rarely face crises more challenging than a lost umbrella or what to have for dinner. But they manage to find (or create) drama within their humdrum existence: the struggle for the TV remote becomes a stylized battle that spoofs karate matches; when a girl calls Noboru, his mother and grandmother cling to him like remoras. Many of the Yamadas' adventures end with an elegant haiku. Does Basho's \"How cruel, a grasshopper trapped under a warrior's helmet\" really apply to Takashi Yamada? He thinks it does. Much of the film's charm comes from the loose, cartoony style that suggests pencil lines and watercolor washes.

{"description": "Robert Altman, the great ironist of American movies, can't resist beginningVincent & Theowith video of an art auction at Christie's, where Van Gogh'sSunflowersattracts dizzying multi-million-dollar bids. Dissolve to the utterly squalid hovel where Vincent (Tim Roth) lives--reminding us that the artist sold but one painting in his poor, tormented lifetime.Vincent & Theois an unusual and--fittingly enough--impressionistic look at Vincent and his brother Theo (Paul Rhys), the mad genius and the art broker. These parallel lives unfold, with Vincent's celebrated wallow in the fires of art running alongside Theo's neurotic struggle to fit into the real world. Roth is mesmerizing and frightening as Vincent, while Rhys gives a more mannered performance that fits Theo's tortured ambivalence. The eerie buzz of Gabriel Yared's music helps us get inside Vincent's head. If the true-life circumstances are unavoidably grim and Altman's pace is slow, almost druggy, the film nevertheless casts a spell.

{"description": "Home to some of the world's best food and fashion, the French also have the wonderful habit of producing some of the world's best movies. WithHigh Tension, French director Alexandre Aja offers up a bloody buffet of terror; a violent concoction of style over substance, with a bloody French twist.       Two college girlfriends, Maria and Alex, take a weekend to study at the secluded country home of Alex's parents.   Shortly after their arrival, a mysterious killer appears, and things take a shockingly terrible turn for the worse. As the horror and body count rises, Maria and Alex find themselves fighting for their lives, and it's revealed that things are not exactly as they seem.     Essentially a one-act cat-and-mouse affair,High Tensionis an explosive bloody thrill ride that rarely lets up.   Oozing style in every color-saturated frame and boasting some intense performances, Aja mainly succeeds in sustaining an intense momentum throughout the film.  The plot occasionally suffers from a thin, flimsy storyline, and the abundant graphic scenes of violence will either thrill and delight, or simply disgust.   Nonetheless, this adrenalin-fueled addition to the genre gives the American slasher flick a real run for its money.High Tensionis high-art horror, and comes highly recommended.--Matt Wold", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001MEJY8W", "B0014VPFVS", "B00125WATQ", "B000EOTVU2", "B000GI3KGC", "B0009WFEDC", "B002EOVXBK", "B00GGY4R3K", "B001G9CNI6", "B00005K9O8", "B000WC38EQ", "B00009W0U4", "B000X1RYEQ", "B0041KKYCY", "B004AC6PV2", "B000EHRVP6", "B0028DRGDQ", "B000N3AW6G", "B005SQRYB4", "B001MFNB4O", "B000GSYRY6", "B000IHY9TS", "B000S0GYRU", "B00009MEC4", "B00187FPC2", "B001D2WU9I", "B0000CABGW", "B001B187L6", "B00G5GNYY2", "B008G1JIQC", "B001JV5BIA", "B002LMSWN2", "B000WC389G", "B0082A3HFK", "B002OVO18A", "B004P2VQZ2", "B00699G622", "B0009OUBC4", "B008JFUNYG", "B000FS9FE4", "B004EI2NP4", "B0013D8L7M", "B008NNY8XQ", "B000GI3RHY", "B00J81S92S", "B001D5C1OO", "B0031U8OEK", "B00196UTEG", "B006QWC2ZC", "B008WAM2E2", "B0015ET3YO", "B005J9ZFQG", "B000MM0LIM", "B00BSU0FQA", "B008BM5WQG", "B00AJLHUA8", "B000GLL1U6", "B003Q6D246", "B0083H6B0U", "B00006FDBW", "B001MVYUR0", "B000IMUYJM", "B00DMUFXOS", "B0021L8UPS", "B000099T3M", "B00CU00JTU", "B003L20IEC", "B0051CSIKQ", "B000NVT0TI", "B00DPUB5EW", "B001D5C1R6", "B00C7C00JU", "B000VKL6Z2", "B006U49SC6", "B0052DP1RC", "B00AZTUUQK", "B002DKGWSE", "B000FZEQWI", "B000RW5BZ0", "B0001611DI", "B0057O6IMS", "B00111YM5Q", "B00177YA6U", "B000UW8596", "B005ER6STG", "B0007WQHI0", "B00079HZY8", "B0009S2T0M", "B00005Q4CS", "B000PKG8TW", "B00006AUIG", "B000AXWHSA", "B001RTKKQW", "B003KGBISE", "B008G33PIM", "B004KDYR20", "6305228876", "B000PMLJMQ", "B002YICNE2", "B0060AAMEI"], "bought_together": ["B001MEJY8W", "B0014VPFVS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001MEJY8W", "B0014VPFVS", "B00GGY4R3K", "B000GI3KGC"]}, "price": 8.37, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 23934}, "asin": "B000ARFPMQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51K3uQHsEXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "High Tension (Unrated Widescreen Edition)"}

Norbu, who is actually from Bhutan, made a splash with his first effort, 1999'sThe Cup.Travellers and Magicianshas a generally similar theme (the sometimes humorous, sometimes discomfiting collision of traditional and modern values and cultures), but a rather different story. This one concerns Dondup (Tsewang Dandup), a young government official who feels trapped in his Bhutanese village and yearns to answer the siren call of America, a place that represents Shangri-La for people who alreadylivein Shangri-La (author James Hilton was said to have used Bhutan as a model for that utopian land in his novelLost Horizon). After missing his bus to Thimphu, the nearest bigger town, Dondup falls in with a group of other travelers, including a lovely young woman and very garrulous monk. As they walk and hitchhike through the breathtaking Himalayan landscape, the monk spins a haunting tale that, though laced with adultery and murder, still has obvious parallels to Dondup's. The pace of the film is leisurely, clearly a reflection of Bhutanese life. The story is simple, the message--an \"is the grass really greener?\" fable--not especially subtle, the ending predictable. What's more, the actors, perhaps appropriately, are non-professionals. But those things somehow add to the pleasure of the film instead of detracting from it, and the direction, editing, and cinematography (especially the almost sepia-toned look of the monk's story sequences) are first-rate by any standards.Travellers and Magicians, with extras that include a \"making of\" featurette and behind-the-scenes location footage, is a keeper.--Sam Graham", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000WMEB1A", "B004JOBTRQ", "B005ZOFJNE", "B0013FMUYU", "6305428360", "B002MZCSW4", "B001EAV3R4", "B000S76VHQ", "B006QVRW80", "050029044X", "8186706798", "9622178103", "B001T46TCO", "157322815X", "1550026801", "6305090580", "0670999016", "B000A0GY28", "B00005UQ8P", "1741049199", "B003XK0S6A", "B004PWCPPW", "1553411528", "1742201334", "1611800307", "1590305701", "B0019DKLHY", "B00B2MJAXS", "0300165323", "0824826795", "B0000203Z5", "B0002J4X20", "1401928463", "0767806239", "B000SAGGLY", "B000CQNJ0U", "B000050KIU", "B000HOMSS6", "B00CNWPTHC", "B000HOMSRW", "B0033XUHAY", "B007IUEE7A", "1932476210", "B007UK018Y", "B000GIXE86", "B000IU3VFI", "B002CO78ZM", "B002XFDKUM", "B000AQ68Y6", "B008N9AASC", "B001EAV3RE", "8878341339", "0691153493", "0981458971", "0143106228", "B0033XUHAO", "B000A59POC", "B004CYVZ18", "B000T4SX92", "0938077260", "B001EI5CBO", "1559394072", "B000KLRPP2", "1582435235", "B0014VPFQI", "157062416X", "B00IWULQQ2", "B005LYLP8Q", "0770437435", "1907973168", "B0044M2OS6", "B000MGBLVE", "B00081IM2Y", "157322118X", "0062510517", "B0037FFBCM", "0888644922", "0803234333", "9744801182", "155939370X", "1590302141", "0861712846", "B000GRUMZA", "1741797233", "B001MYIPYQ", "B005U0ZP46", "B001CDLAT4", "6305416222", "9748495965", "B0002C814I", "B00B1VBF0Q", "1932476350", "189020661X", "B0007GP7DM", "0898002443"], "bought_together": ["B000WMEB1A", "B004JOBTRQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000WMEB1A", "B004JOBTRQ", "B001EAV3R4", "B003XK0S6A"]}, "price": 18.78, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 104099}, "asin": "B000ARG2RI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RYQ5N5J7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Travellers &amp; Magicians"}

{"description": "The first half ofBattlestar Galactica's second season left no doubts about the continuing excellence of the best science fiction TV series of 2005. Beginning with the Colonial Fleet separated, Col. Tigh (Michael Hogan) botching his temporary command, and Capt. Adama (Edward James Olmos) near death after a Cylon assassination attempt, series producer/developer Ronald D. Moore and his gifted writing staff packed more into these 10 episodes than most series manage in a full season. Maintaining its reputation as an adult drama, the series is compellingly anchored by the gravitas of Olmos and Mary McDonnell, whose role as Fleet President Laura Roslin grows more complex as she reveals her diagnosis of breast cancer and defies Adama, playing the \"religious card\" with her conviction that prophetic visions will lead the embattled fleet toward its legendary home planet Earth. As Adama's son Apollo (Jamie Bamber) wrestles with his role in Roslin's mutinous agenda, paranoia runs high as Cylon copies (or \"avatars\") of Boomer (Grace Park) complicate matters aboard Galactica and on Kobol, where a lost Raptor crew struggles to survive and Dr. Baltar (James Callis) endures the increasingly haunting and manipulative intrusions into his tormented psyche by Number Six (Tricia Helfer), the seductive Cylon who holds the secret to the Cylon master plan to destroy humankind.Further action takes place on Cylon-occupied Caprica, where Starbuck (Katee Sackhoff) and Helo (Tamoh Penikett) discover a group of human resistance fighters who survived the Cylons' nuclear attack in season 1. As all of these plot threads are expertly interwoven, the high-stakes conflict ofBG 2.0culminates in a suspenseful mid-season cliffhanger. Through all of this,Battlestar Galacticamaintains consistently high standards of intelligent drama and well-justified, story-based use of spectacular special effects, while developing rich relationships across a broad spectrum of interesting supporting characters. The series' large and likable cast is well-used throughout (even smaller roles are given adequate dimension), and Moore's \"podcast\" commentaries provide a smart, thorough analysis of the show's writing process and conceptual evolution. Yes, it's undeniably true that this half-season DVD set is a blatantly commercial ploy to lure more and more viewers into the ongoing season (which resumed in January 2006), but you can hardly blame Universal for capitalizing on a high-quality series. With solid ratings, good scripts, and a devoted cast and crew,Battlestar Galacticashowed every indication of thriving toward a third season and beyond.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001HUWQEA", "B00129W6LE", "B000AJJNFE", "B002HRF68A", "B000V5IP6K", "B002ZCY872", "B00A3717C0", "B00466H3A4", "B00064AFBE", "B001RTCP1U", "B002JE43O4", "B000W4KT9G", "B003RR991Y", "B00GX7D5G0", "B002HRF7AW", "B003H9LIYS", "B00A3718IS", "B0000AFX64", "B00C7MW5SE", "B00344EAFK", "B001B7CNZ6", "B000QDLSR0", "B000UZ4C4A", "B000F8O2OM", "B000F8O2OW", "B00IWTVDUW", "B000F8O2P6", "1417078723", "B005PPMHWE", "B0024FAD9C", "B00005JNOG", "B00242KD1S", "B0032JTUX4", "B002BAW6GS", "B002N5N5MK", "B000BW7QWW", "B00BD6K54G", "B0007TKH66", "B003H9LIRK", "B0017MO10U", "B002BAW6GI", "B000A9QKRI", "B000FCUYKO", "6303961614", "B004EXWGHY", "B00F6WXPSQ", "B003L77GWE", "B000F8O2Q0", "B0009Q0F5U", "B003L77GUG", "B004HYW84G", "B000LC4ZI0", "B000B8IA2G", "B007USE5CE", "B0002PYS7Y", "B002BWP2IK", "B001RHGRTS", "B0000AQS0F", "B002BAW6FE", "B000F8O2PG", "B00243FQFA", "B000HEZEY6", "B000FIMG68", "B00E3QJ7JC", "B000F8O2PQ", "B000B837XI", "B005PPMHO2", "B00GTZWZH6", "B000RBA6CO", "B0009JE6G6", "B0048FUUAI", "B0028ERCMU", "B0081QF6Q8", "B003BNO9GO", "B000GLKNRI", "B004X60QWO", "B00062IDCO", "B0030VANJO", "B002BAW6FY", "B007XF0XVQ", "B00F3L8P26", "B000FP2OPY", "B001D2WUGG", "B00402FGE4", "B0057FGD3Q", "B0000CABIJ", "B003BV8I7C", "B002VA59ZS", "B000SO7PBU", "B00E8OMZGG", "B002VA5A02", "B00188XHFI", "B001DMVZOE", "B008R52LA2", "B002PXJRR2", "B004X60QE2", "B004TJ1H3C", "B000CEXFYW", "B0002WZTCA"], "bought_together": ["B001HUWQEA", "B00129W6LE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0036EH3UC", "B000AJJNFE", "B00129W6LE", "B00A3717C0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 29107}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 14.69, "brand": "Universal Studios", "asin": "B000BNI90Y", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51IfCLLm3jL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Battlestar Galactica - Season 2.0 (Episodes 1-10)"}

{"description": "Three world-class directors put their auteurist stamps on this anthology of films dealing with sex, desire, and obsession. First, and best, is \"The Hand,\" Wong Kar-Wai's ravishing drama set in 1960s Hong Kong. Chang Chen stars as an apprentice tailor who becomes enthrall to an imperious, tragically downwardly mobile courtesan (Gong Li). During their first meeting, she takes a hands-on interest in his sexual initiation, explaining that the memory will inspire him to make beautiful clothes for her. Steven Soderbergh lightens the mood with \"Equilibrium,\" starring Robert Downey Jr. as a very anxious 1950s adman relating a curious dream to a very distracted psychiatrist (the always wonderful Alan Arkin). Last, and sadly, least, is Michelangeolo Antonioni's \"The Dangerous Thread of Things\" about an estranged couple, a tryst, and dancing nude on the beach. A world away from such towering masterworks asL'Aventura, it's elusive and pretentious, almost like anSCTVparody of 1960s foreign films. But here, for the more prurient viewers, is the earthy, gratuitious nudity and frolicking sex for which one might desire in a movie titledEros.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00LT1JHLW", "B000BRBA8S", "B0010SAGHS", "B000E33W0I", "B008MPQ0R2", "B00JVQ7QTM", "B0002X7GWU", "B004YCKJNI", "B000A1OFZA", "B001O7SWHG", "B000EU1ONS", "B0016MJ6HY", "B000NO1XG8", "B000GBEWPC", "B00HVOFP6W", "B00061I29E", "B00K0MM4AM", "B00003CXUM", "B00003JRAV", "B004KVXC64", "B00GPPXNLC", "B004SEUJEG", "B00005M1ZQ", "B00BNWWUDY", "B00064AFK0", "B00AOO5PXO", "B005BJ7XL4", "B008220DIC", "B00005BHW6", "B00GPPXNQ2", "B00ET2ODX0", "B004H0M2WI", "B004SUDQC2", "B00006LPER", "B00BJSLNN0", "B001BPB5YI", "B0000694XY", "B00IKM5OYW", "B00GB0OVV2", "B0027BOL46", "B00HE011DE", "B00HGBAG5K", "B0071HPP1Y", "B001DE29SS", "B003C9VEVK", "B000QXDCLA", "B000092T3H", "B000YV1Q30", "B00IGK6TH4", "B00GPPXP6A", "B0009GX1XI", "B0000A1HR4", "B0041LULL2", "B00JPQ1I7O", "B005D0RDWK", "B001TK80CA", "B00E1HIWXU", "B000NVT0SO", "B000065V3B", "B002P7UCJK", "B00DZP1C3Q", "B000JGWD50", "B00ATK015K", "B00F98FOFY", "B001PYD0KW", "B006GVNHUM", "B00004W21Z", "B000FZEU0G", "B000F3UA6Q", "B00023P4I8", "B00BSN0VZ2", "B001EKGQX0", "B00005JMIJ", "B000C3L2P2", "B00003CXDJ", "B000PKG8TM", "B000E1NXJ0", "B00022S7EC", "B003ZJ9572", "B00004W229", "6304884370", "B00000F7E6", "B006MGWBWQ", "B00GBT62PQ", "B0031REQAO", "B001CW7ZT4", "6305460183", "B00005JL57", "B00B2BYXSG", "B00782O7LG", "B001O2UTRC", "B000OY8NBK", "B002ZG9940", "B009AVC936", "B00005Y6XB", "B002P7UCBI", "B00097DY2A", "B002M9WW5I", "B0000687DE", "B0064MT1NU"], "bought_together": ["B000BRBA8S", "B0010SAGHS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000NO1XG8", "B000E33W0I", "B00AOO5PXO", "B001O7SWHG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 202745}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.07, "brand": "Warner Bros", "asin": "B000C3L26Q", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51VXWFV7YCL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Eros"}

{"description": "Nobody does comic existential angst like Nicolas Cage, who gets a good workout inThe Weather Man, an underrated slice of quiet desperation. Cage plays David Spritz, a Chicago TV meteorologist who knows only too well the constant uncertainty of predicting the weather. Despite a possible offer from a network morning show, David's life is a mess:  he's estranged from his kids and irritated wife (Hope Davis), he's perpetually at odds with his remote father (Michael Caine), and lately people on the street have had the disconcerting habit of throwing food at him. Director Gore Verbinski (Pirates of the Caribbean) has perhaps too heavy a touch for this kind of comic melancholy, but screenwriter Steven Conrad has an interesting, almost Mamet-like ear for \"written\" dialogue--Cage has a few voiceover monologues, including an uproarious sequence involving tartar sauce and a walk to the store, that are hugely funny. It's possible that we've seen Cage in this kind of character one too many times, but he's still good at it, and his doleful face and pasted-on smile fit the mood of the picture. Unlike the heroes of most Hollywood movies, David Spritz doesn't always--or often--do the right thing, but Cage makes you want to see the poor sap make it.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00012QLB4", "B005F2JRUC", "B00005JLRE", "B000JYW5DW", "B000BBOUW2", "B001J710Z2", "B000PMFRZQ", "B000GRUMRS", "B000CNESJO", "B000TGJ8CQ", "B00E8G5HNM", "B000BYA5G4", "B000059TG6", "B004EPYZOO", "B00003CXXG", "B000IFRT5Q", "B001GCUO02", "B00BTYMPX6", "0767810856", "6304806434", "B00006LPGP", "B002TVQ48A", "B002TVQ48K", "B001MLZNLW", "B00441GZ00", "B00000G02H", "B00008L3UF", "0792838068", "B00AEBB8JM", "B00BJB2GZG", "B004XFZ4JK", "B00062IDGK", "B000OVLBF8", "B007IUEEA2", "B000B8I9Y0", "B002GHHHKG", "B00IKM5OYW", "0792844831", "B000NA1WDQ", "076780676X", "B001JIE7JC", "B00005JLSB", "B0007P0X9G", "B00007AJF8", "B00C6F61HS", "6304711891", "B00005JL7Q", "B00005JK8K", "B00005JN5E", "B00004Z4WR", "B004SIP95G", "B00003CXPV", "B00003L9CH", "B00000JGHL", "B00275EHBY", "B00003CWTI", "B0071HPOV0", "B0015OKWKS", "B002VECMAE", "B00HUCF6KK", "B0039UT3LK", "6301971345", "B000EHRVOW", "B00AEFYAC0", "B000H0MKOC", "B005DCJ2DG", "B00007J5VQ", "B002ZG99KO", "B003102JDM", "B0009R1TI6", "B002CPMB9O", "B00BB67UNW", "B000FDEVA2", "B000CBCWRG", "B000066TGP", "B0013D8LC2", "B00020HAX8", "B00005JLO8", "B00005JLFA", "B001P3SA8K", "B002ZG980U", "B0045HCJFS", "B006TTC5MM", "B000DZIGDU", "B000H6SXSI", "B00AEBB9CS", "B000EDWKXI", "B000NIVJF4", "B00062IVM6", "B00009K011", "B0015OKWKI", "B009L79YFU", "B00005JMJG", "B0002W4UDE", "B000286RNE", "B002ZG983M", "B000UJ48SQ", "B000MEYFY6", "B00008EY9G", "B00AEBB9WI"], "bought_together": ["B00012QLB4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00012QLB4", "B000JLTRIQ", "B005F2JRUC", "B000JYW5DW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 132923}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.47, "brand": "Paramount Home Video", "asin": "B000CSUNQQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51JTWC5Y4HL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Weather Man (Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "When Frank Beardsley (Dennis Quaid), a widower of 8 children runs into his high school sweetheart, Helen North (Rene Russo), it&#x92;s as if thirty years never passed! Helen, also a widow with ten kids of her own that include the six she and her husband adopted, feels the attraction as well. It&#x92;s no wonder they rush into marriage without telling their kids. True love can conquer all&#x97;right? Unfortunately for Frank and Helen, the families don&#x92;t mesh quite as easily as the newlyweds had hoped. They probably should have seen the culture clash coming: the disciplined Beardsleys run things by the book; for the energetic and vivacious Norths, there is no book. Helen&#x92;s kids aren&#x92;t pleased about moving and sharing rooms with a bunch of uptight strangers. Frank&#x92;s children have nothing in common with the Norths. Since both sets of kids aren&#x92;t happy, they devise a plan to undermine the marriage and team up to plot the breakup. East meets west as the two families finds a way to work together&#x97;in order to separate. Just when it appears that the kids have succeeded, they realize they like each other despite their differences&#x97;they don&#x92;t want their families to split up! Can they save Frank and Helen&#x92;s marriage after they so brilliantly split them up?

Sending star-on-the-rise Vincent Chase (Adrian Grenier) and his boys from Queens (hence the title of the show) into places like Sundance and ComiCon created a whole new treasure trove of inside jokes, and for that we thank them. The usual clutter of celeb cameos abound (Hugh Hefner, Pauly Shore, Ralph Macchio,), but one main story arc takes up the entire season: Vincent's casting inAquaman, the big-budget movie he didn't want to star in, and then had to vie against Leonardo DiCaprio to get. Mandy Moore turns up as the only girl who ever broke Vince's heart (on the set ofA Walk to Remember, allegedly) and now re-enters his life as his Aquagirl, while James Cameron makes a few appearances as director of the superhero project. In the meantime, Turtle (Jerry Ferrara) goes from moocher to music manager, Eric (Kevin Connolly) gets courted to be a big-time agent, and Johnny \"Drama\" (Kevin Dillon, ever the punchline) ponders calf implants and gets fired from a Movie of the Week with Brooke Shields. The biggest turn of events, however, happens to Vince's slick agent Ari Gold (an Emmy-worthy Jeremy Piven), who pulls a Jerry Maguire by the end of the season. Ari's ability to switch sides on a dime -- that is, to choke up at his daughter's bat mitzvah, then manipulate the family moment into a publicity stunt to lure his client away from a rival, continues to make Piven the firecracker of the bunch. Grenier is slightly less vacuous than last season, but still has the least interesting personality (which could be the point of the show--that it takes a village to make any Joe Actor into a movie star) .Unfortunately the DVD features no commentary and just one extra: Executive Producer Mark Wahlberg, on whom the show is based, interviews the cast and producers. The banter is interesting enough, but Wahlberg makes such a dull interviewer it's certain we won't see a talk-show host career in Vince's future.--Ellen A.

{"description": "When lonely hearts want to connect, is there any better way, really, than dancing?Marilyn Hotchkiss Ballroom Dancing & Charm Schoolis a sweet indie valentine to dance, and to the connection of lost, broken souls. The stellar cast is led by English Everyguy Robert Carlyle, a widower who believes he's fulfilling a dying man's last wish--to find a long-lost love--by showing up at a Thursday night dance class. Carlyle is by turns awkward, warm, sincere and bewildered, perfectly believable as a man awash in grief yet hoping to rejoin life. It turns out that dance class, led by the theatrical Mary Steenburgen, holds his lifeline. Other strong performances come from Marisa Tomei, Sean Astin, John Goodman, Ernie Hudson, David Paymer, Camryn Manheim and Sonia Braga, all of whom play people yearning for something, some one. Viewers may get distracted early in the film, seeing Carlyle in a dance venue and secretly hoping the soundtrack would queue up \"You Sexy Thing,\" to get to see Carlyle reprise some of his fabulous shtick fromThe Full Monty. But it turns out Carlyle is just as winning performing the Lindy Hop or waltz. And, the film suggests, once the body moves and the soul is stirred--can love be far behind? The answer is: May I have the honor of this dance? Extras include the short 1990 film this feature was based on and an audio commentary.--A.T.

{"description": "The hook-wielding Fisherman returns in the third installment of the popular teen-horror franchise based on Lois Duncan's novelI Know What You Did Last Summer. Jennifer Love Hewitt, who top-billed the previous entries, is nowhere to be found in this film, and the action has been moved from a fishing village to a Colorado ski community where a gaggle of attractive teens led by Amber (Brooke Nevin) are wrapped up in a prank gone wrong which again results in an unfortunate death. The friends commit to keeping the accident silent, until they are plagued by mysterious messages that implicate them in the murder. What follows is the standard stalk-and-slash, with the Fisherman (played here by Don Shanks) dispatching the guilty parties with a modicum of bloody special effects, until the inevitable showdown. Director Sylvian White, an acclaimed music-video helmer, pulls out all the visual stops to deliver a \"cutting edge\" thriller, but the story itself was drained of any interest by the two previous films, and what's left is a empty exercise in flashy excess that may prove a passing entertainment for teen viewers seeking a good excuse to scream (and snuggle). The DVD includes a making-of featurette and an anemic, tech-minded commentary track by White.--Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305300801", "6305017115", "B000A5045Q", "B005CFBYW6", "B004LWZW2O", "0767824954", "B0009MWEM6", "B0009MWELW", "B003PIUINS", "B004EPZ08O", "B0000541TL", "B004SIP9MY", "B00JF5GAIW", "B004SIP9P6", "B005OK722U", "B000099T3M", "B004SIP9O2", "B00CAATSME", "B000UJ48P4", "0767802497", "B000PMLJMQ", "B004AC6PV2", "B00006LPHA", "B000F6IOAM", "B004P7CN7W", "B000FA57US", "B00275EHDM", "B00005JMDZ", "B00275EHFU", "B00AEFY37C", "B005CFC0N8", "B000EHRVP6", "B000WC389G", "B004P7CM9Q", "B00003CXUP", "B003ZZ7TPG", "B000KJU1KK", "B00DTPRZ24", "B00BM4Q4H6", "B00006FDBT", "B000RIWAVW", "B004AC6PMG", "B002YICNE2", "B00DTPRZ10", "B000FA57UI", "B000VKL6Z2", "B000AM4P9K", "B00JMLQGQ0", "B004SUDQ1I", "B000CCBC9O", "B0002JP572", "B003PIUINI", "B000RGN2JI", "B0000VCZMK", "B002I41KNC", "B0000AOX09", "B004P7CNUY", "B0000APVJ0", "B00004XPPI", "B00018D42W", "B00CERJI5U", "B0000CEB6Y", "B001YYQ9S8", "B001GCUO4S", "B000056T5E", "B005GT3X68", "B001P3SA9Y", "B001NPD9LS", "0792840127", "B00009WVSL", "B0020PFYHC", "B004LWZW2Y", "B0001LJCKC", "B001KEHAEO", "B00AIZ2FPK", "B002XD0J80", "B00DTPRYY8", "B000MM0LIM", "B00006FI0R", "B00AZMFINM", "B004TI35YC", "B000EHSVLE", "B00AEFYGBA", "B00000F0AD", "B00005JLKN", "B003Q6D27S", "B000055WFZ", "B000FOQ1KY", "B00AQJ8MLY", "B008MXMFVE", "B002AS45VK", "B000FC2HS6", "B00IVLRA9E", "B000FS9FE4", "B004SIP9I8", "B0057YUV6C", "B00003CWRF", "B001L9EXUC", "B00B96TGQS"], "bought_together": ["6305300801", "6305017115"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000A5045Q", "6305300801", "B005CFBYW6", "6305017115"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 150206}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.54, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B000FSME9M", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514QuGIu1EL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "I'll Always Know What You Did Last Summer"}
{"description": "The maturation and coming of age of a young woman is a difficult and often confusing journey for any young girl, but the road for Anne Shirley (Kim Braden), an orphan taken in as a child by Marilla Cuthbert (Barbara Hamilton) and her deceased brother Matthew, is littered with unique challenges that test her own beliefs, talents, dreams, and sense of self-worth.  Based on the \"Anne of Avonlea\" and \"Anne of the Island\" children's books by L.M. Montgomery, this 6-episode, 5-hour 1975 BBC mini-series (not the popular PBS version directed by Kevin Sullivan and starring Megan Follows) opens with a bright and ambitious Anne as she prepares to begin teaching in the local school and actively serves as an advocate and secretary on the newly formed Village Improvement Society in Avonlea.  A highly principled young woman, Anne's idealistic resolves are quickly tested as is her limited knowledge of small town politics.  The death of a neighbor leads Anne and Marilla to welcome two young orphans into their household, resulting in Anne's selflessly setting aside her dreams of attending college.  Formal schooling aside, Anne's education regarding marriage, politics, and human nature continues right there in Avonlea. Eventually, Anne's dreams of attending college are realized and she quickly discovers how much she still has to learn about friendship, love, and self-sufficiency. This BBC production features convincing talent and a sense of intimacy that is reinforced by a sparseness of set and music and a tendency toward up-close photography.

{"description": "It isn'tCandid Camera, it isn'tPunk'd--it'sThe Perry Project. \"Scary\" Perry Caravello, an out-of-shape, fuzzy-haired, gravel-voiced extra thinks he's scored the lead in \"sports detective\" spoofWindy City Heat. Everywhere he goes, the fanny pack-sporting \"Stone Fury\" is followed by cameras, presumably for a DVD featurette. In actuality, he's the unsuspecting victim of an elaborate practical joke. Bobcat Goldthwait (Chappelle's Show,Jimmy Kimmel Live) directs both the real movie and the mockumentary, while Dane Cook puts in an appearance as casting agent \"Roman Polanski\" and Toby Huss as photographer \"Ansel Adams\" (all the fake names have real-world counterparts). Caravello's buddies, Tony Barbieri (\"The Mole\") and Don Barris (\"Big Lou\"), are members of the same cast...or so he thinks. In reality, they're in on the prank. In fact, they co-wrote the screenplay with producer Jimmy Kimmel. Reportedly, Eminem, Johnny Knoxville, and Fall Out Boy are crazy about this cult classic in the making, but the humiliating, off-color humor won't be to all tastes.

During the peak of the Third Reich, Sophie Scholl (Julia Jentsch,The Edukators), along with her brother Hans and other students in Munich, formed a resistance group called the White Rose and distributed anti-Nazi leaflets.Sophie Schollbegins on a crisp winter day, with Sophie and Hans distributing leaflets around the empty halls of a university before class is let out.  The tension only increases as they are arrested, interrogated, and swiftly convicted in a brutal show trial. The heart of the film are the scenes between Sophie and her interrogator, Robert Mohr (Gerald Alexander Held), a loyal Nazi who nonetheless respected and perhaps even admired Sophie.  Their arguments, distilled down from hours of historical record, crackle with emotion and resonate throughout history, from Communist totalitarianism to the Bush administration condemning critics of the Iraq war as traitors. Jentsch's restrained performance only grows more and more moving over the movie's course.

{"description": "Dr. No: Released in 1962, this first James Bond movie remains one of the best, and serves as an entertaining reminder that the Bond series began (in keeping with Ian Fleming's novels) with a surprising lack of gadgetry and big-budget fireworks. Sean Connery was just 32 years old when he won the role of Agent 007. In his first adventure James Bond is called to Jamaica where a colleague and secretary have been mysteriously killed. With an American CIA agent (Jack Lord, pre-Hawaii Five-O), they discover that the nefarious Dr. No (Joseph Wiseman) is scheming to blackmail the U.S. government with a device capable of deflecting and destroying U.S. rockets launched from Cape Canaveral. Of course, Bond takes time off from his exploits to enjoy the company of a few gorgeous women, including the bikini-clad Ursula Andress. She gloriously kicks off the long-standing tradition of Bond women who know how to please their favorite secret agent. A sexist anachronism? Maybe, but this is Bond at his purest, kicking off a series of movies that shows no sign of slowing down. --Jeff ShannonYou Only Live Twice: The film boasts the best of the Bond title songs (this one sung on a dreamy track by Nancy Sinatra), but the movie itself is one of the weaker ones of the Sean Connery phase of the 007 franchise. The story concerns an effort by the evil organization SPECTRE to start a world war, but the not-so-super villain behind the plot is the awfully civilized Donald Pleasence. The thin script is by Roald Dahl (shouldn't we have expected a better Bond nemesis from the creator of mad geniusWilly Wonka?), and direction is by British veteran Lewis Gilbert (Alfie). But the movie can't hold a candle toDr. No,From Russia with Love, orGoldfinger. --Tom KeoghOctopussy: Roger Moore was nearing the end of his reign as James Bond when he madeOctopussy, and he looks a little worn out. But the movie itself infuses some new blood into the old franchise, with a frisky pace and a pair of sturdy villains. Maud Adams--who'd also been in the Bond outingThe Man with the Golden Gun--plays the improbably named Octopussy, while old smoothie Louis Jourdan is her crafty partner in crime. There's an island populated only by women, plus a fantastic sequence with a hand-to-hand fight that happens on a plane--and on top of a plane. The film even has an extra emotional punch, since this time out 007 is not only following the orders of Her Majesty's Secret Service, but he is also exacting a personal revenge: a fellow double-0 agent has been killed. Two Bond films were actually released in 1983 within a few months of each other, asOctopussywas followed by Sean Connery's comeback inNever Say Never Again. The success of both pictures proved that there was still plenty of mileage left in the old license to kill, though Moore had one more workout--A View to a Kill--before hanging it up. And that title? The franchise had already used up the titles to Ian Fleming's novels, soOctopussywas taken from a lesser-known Fleming short story. --Robert HortonTomorrow Never Dies: Pierce Brosnan returns for his second stint as James Bond (afterGoldenEye), and he's doing it in high style with an invigorating cast of costars. It's only appropriate that a Bond film from 1997 would find Agent 007 pitted against a media mogul (Jonathan Pryce) who's going to start a global war (beginning with stolen nuclear missiles aimed at China) to create attention-grabbing headlines for his latest multimedia news channel. It's the information age run amok, and Bond must team up with a lovely and lethal agent from the Chinese External Security Force (played by Honk Kong action star Michelle Yeoh) to foil the madman's plot of global domination. Luckily for Bond, the villain's wife (Teri Hatcher) is one of his former lovers, and at the behest of his superior M (Judi Dench), 007 finds ample opportunity to exploit the connection. Armed with the usual array of gadgets (including a remote-controlled BMW), Brosnan settles into his role with acceptable flair, and the dynamic Yeoh provides a perfect balance to the sexism that once threatened to turn Bond into a politically incorrect anachronism. He's still Bond, to be sure, but he's saving the world with a bit more sophisticated finesse. --Jeff ShannonMoonraker: This was the first James Bond adventure produced after the success ofStar Wars, so it jumped on the sci-fi bandwagon by combining the suave appeal of Agent 007 (once again played by Roger Moore) with enough high-tech hardware and special effects to make Luke Skywalker want to join Her Majesty's Secret Service. After the razzle-dazzle ofThe Spy Who Loved Me, this attempt to latch onto a trend proved to be a case of overkill, even though it brought back the steel-toothed villain Jaws (Richard Kiel) and scored a major hit at the box office. This time Bond is up against a criminal industrialist named Drax (Michel Lonsdale) who wants to control the world from his orbiting space station. In keeping with his well-groomed style, Bond thwarts this maniacal Neo-Hitler's scheme with the help of a beautiful, sleek-figured scientist (played by Lois Chiles with all the vitality of a department-store mannequin). Despite Moore's passive performance (which Pauline Kael described as \"like an office manager who is turning into dead wood but hanging on to collect his pension\"),Moonrakerhad no problem attracting an appreciative audience, and there are even a few renegade Bond-philes who consider it one of their favorites. --Sean AxmakerBeyondJames Bond Ultimate Collection - Vol. 4James Bond Ultimate Collection - Vol. 1James Bond Ultimate Edition - Vol. 2James Bond Ultimate Edition - Vol. 3Stills fromJames Bond Ultimate Collection - Vol. 4(click for larger image)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000ICM5V2", "B00000BCPF", "B00000BLFI", "B001PPLIEG", "B00AQSN7HE", "B00004WEJZ", "B0000BYRO9", "B00006BH8G", "B007REV4T8", "B00005JL0I", "B0000BYRO7", "B00HRUQAKU", "B007REV4YI", "B009A87Z6U", "B00003CXC5", "B000RPCK1U", "B001R10BN2", "B0000TG95Q", "B000M53GMC", "B00003CX5P", "B00003CXCT", "B000RPCK24", "B003V4JTZE", "B000MGBLTQ", "B000GUJZ0U", "B00GSTHDCU", "B0008ENHV2", "0792841670", "B00005KARG", "B000K7VHYG", "B001DHXT6G", "B009A87ZQU", "B000063V8R", "B00BMJ7ZKG", "B000NIBUR6", "B002GSXKN8", "B009RO9LKK", "B000G6BLHY", "0792838408", "B00008G8M4", "B00008PC0Y", "B000M53GN6", "B000P6XQ50", "B00003CXJ1", "B00004VVMZ", "B000AOEMXM"], "bought_together": ["B000ICM5V2", "B00000BCPF"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00000BLFI", "B00000BCPF", "B000ICM5V2", "B0000BYRO9"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 100254}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 49.48, "brand": "TCFHE/MGM", "asin": "B000ICM5VC", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51tYKMX9PRL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "James Bond Ultimate Edition - Vol. 4 (Dr. No / You Only Live Twice / Octopussy / Tomorrow Never Dies / Moonraker)"}
{"description": "If Richard Donner's 1978 feature filmSuperman: The Moviemade us believe a man could fly, Bryan Singer's 2006 follow-up,Superman Returns, lets us remember that a superhero movie can make our spirits soar. Superman (played by newcomer Brandon Routh) comes back to Earth after a futile five-year search for his destroyed home planet of Krypton. As alter ego Clark Kent, he's eager to return to his job at the Daily Planet and to see Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth). Lois, however, has moved on: she now has a fianc&#xE9; (James Marsden), a son (Tristan Leabu), and a Pulitzer Prize for her article entitled \"Why the World Doesn't Need Superman.\" On top of this emotional curveball, his old archrival Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) is plotting the biggest land grab in history.Singer, who made a strong impression among comic-book fans for his work on the X-Men franchise and directed Spacey inThe Usual Suspects, brings both a fresh eye and a sense of respect to the world's oldest superhero. He borrows John Williams's great theme music and Marlon Brando's voice as Jor-El, and the story (penned by Singer'sX-Mencollaborators Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris) is a sort-of-sequel to the first two films in the franchise (choosing to ignore that the third and fourth movies ever happened). The humorous and romantic elements give the movie a heart, Singer's art-deco Metropolis is often breathtaking, and the special effects are elegant and spectacular, particularly an early airplane-disaster set-piece. Of the cast, Routh is excellent as the dual Superman/Clark, Spacey is both droll and vicious as Luthor, and Parker Posey gets the best lines as Luthor's moll Kitty. But at 23, Bosworth seems too young for the five-years-past-grizzled Lois. It's nice to see Noel Neill, Jack Larson (both from the classicAdventures of SupermanTV series), and Eva Marie-Saint on the screen as well. Superman Returns is one of those projects that was in development for seemingly forever, but it was worth the wait -- it's the most enjoyable superhero movie sinceSpider-Man 2andThe Incredibles.--David HoriuchiMore SupermanWatch our exclusive interviews with the cast ofSuperman ReturnsOther feature filmsSuperman in high definitionSmallvilleAdventures of SupermanSee all Superman DVDs", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001DJLD2G", "B000IJ79VQ", "B000IJ79X4", "B000IJ79XE", "B000IJ79WU", "B008JFUPFI", "B000IJ79UW", "B001CDR1FG", "B000ION23U", "B002GSXKN8", "B004EPZ07K", "B0000959N0", "B00005JNTU", "B004LWZWFQ", "B001DHXT20", "B000VI70QS", "B0006L0LOS", "B0007P0Y7C", "B000UR9T8C", "B00005JNJV", "B00005JMQW", "B00005JKCH", "B000AYELVU", "B004LWZW42", "B0090SI56Y", "B001OST0LW", "B001OST0M6", "B001QB9H1U", "B000HCO83Q", "B000PE0G0A", "B001GCUO1Q", "B0002IQMAM", "B004LWZWGA", "B008JFUS0U", "B000P0J06K", "B000OVLBF8", "B00E5I2MCM", "B003YAR97K", "B001GZ6QC4", "B00080ZG2O", "B003QO8TOQ", "B001FB55HQ", "B005LAIGW8", "B000I8OM94", "B000FO0AHY", "B00IZZDWKM", "B000P0J06U", "B0007V6ITE", "B008JFUO72", "B000AYELVA", "B002NXSRVG", "B00DYEN6XC", "B00E5I2MEK", "B000BT96EG", "B001HQZJMU", "B001QTXM5Y", "B00E5I2M6I", "B002HWRYJE", "B00E5I2M9K", "B001614E68", "B000059Z8L", "B001VLBDD0", "B000EU1Q3Q", "B000EU1Q2M", "B000KJU1KK", "B00BTYMPUY", "B000H30B2C", "B001F7MSFM", "B0013BM63O", "B00F4FFO8E", "B000EGDB10", "B00008G8M5", "B00JPS7HOA", "0790738953", "B000B7QCGS", "B000HWZ4E8", "B00BBXSPES", "B000FMGTTE", "B0083SBMBM", "B003Z8ZCDO", "B005LAII44", "B000P6XQ50", "B000VI28Z6", "B00AZMFJYA", "B001RHGRT8", "B000F4RH8E", "B002ZG99B8", "B001AK3S4Y", "B00005JL78", "B0002ZMHX6", "B0007G89FU", "B006VRRGNK", "B00BBAQD6S", "B009JBWOU0", "B000BT96FA", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B00BGI086Q", "B003UN2ICM", "B0000VCZMK"], "bought_together": ["B008JFUPFI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B008JFUPFI", "B00F4FFO8E", "B001DJLD2G", "B000IJ79UW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 57565}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.73, "brand": "DC Comics", "asin": "B000J10EQU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Ddmxk8VML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Superman Returns (Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "Sweet baby Jesus, we thank you for blessing Will Ferrell and Adam McKay with the talent to create a NASCAR comedy as hilarious asTalladega Nights. The so-called \"Ballad of Ricky Bobby\" is hardly flawless  in fact it's not always firing on all cylinders  but with comedy star Ferrell and director McKay still hot from the success of their previous comedy hitAnchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy, most of this 108-minute spoof of oval-track racing is so knee-slappin' funny that you can't help but surrender to the stupidity.Obviously, Ferrell's the shining star, and his portrayal of lead-footed pit-crew-member-turned-#1 NASCAR champion Ricky \"I Wanna Go Fast\" Bobby (how can you not love that name?) is spot-on perfect, righteously spoofing the entirety of NASCAR culture without insulting its oft-ridiculed roots in redneck bootlegging of a bygone era. You could even argue that Talladega Nights is truer to NASCAR than Tom Cruise'sDays of Thunder, and it's certainly more entertaining, especially when you add John C. Reilly as Ricky's life-long pal, teammate, and eventual rival Cal Naughton, Jr. (together they're nicknamed \"Shake 'n Bake\"), and Sacha Baron Cohen (fromDa Ali G ShowandBorat) as gay French \"Formula Un\" driver-turned NASCAR rival Jean Girrard, to a stellar cast including Molly Shannon, Greg Germann, Amy Adams and Michael Clarke Duncan.Sure, it's mostly a showcase for Ferrell's loud, over-the-top antics and nonsensical non sequiturs (like cameo appearances by Elvis Costello and Mos Def), but with Ferrell behind the wheel,Talladega Nightsrolls into victory lane with fuel to spare, and there's one final bit of comedy (with a tip of the hat to William Faulkner) for those who sit through the credits. --Jeff ShannonStills fromTalladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby(click for larger image)More NASCAR andTalladega Nightsat Amazon.comThe CalendarOn blu-rayNASCAR on PSPOur NASCAR StoreNASCAR The Imax ExperienceSpeed, Guts, and GloryBookOther Will Ferrell FilmsAnchor ManElfThe Best of Will FerrellMore Films by Will Ferrell", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000WZEZFY", "B001G5T6H6", "B000HRMCTI", "B0007TS24U", "B0009K7RT8", "B00096S49O", "B000EJ9VDY", "B000KF0GSQ", "B000OVLBFI", "B000AM8RQM", "B000SH3XCM", "B00000G02A", "B001F76PDI", "B000ELL1P8", "B000A6QMQA", "B002EQFXZA", "B000L2125O", "B0009Z3LGQ", "B000ASBKHE", "B0009NSDCK", "B000FIS7HK", "B0007TFLLM", "B0012IWO08", "B002SD94AY", "B003L51GW2", "B0007V46JI", "B000ASDFGS", "B000IFRT5G", "B0008JFMEW", "B000GPVUMG", "B000AQ6904", "B002BSC57U", "B0009VCSXW", "B0008JFMF6", "B000R3BN4M", "B007M6W36Y", "B000BYRCHE", "B0009RCPV6", "B000E1YW04", "B002I0GZBI", "B0009X7BFA", "B000B5IP6U", "B0009KQOME", "B000A0GP5Y", "B000ENUYFE", "B0050JN84Q", "B000BGZRTC", "B003DS4Z6Q", "B001KMRN0M", "B000G8O0MU", "B000EWBKU8", "B0047ERZ7Q", "B000KKRD2S", "B00168PFFK", "B00311G2DY", "B00083G5CG", "B002BS47WG", "B0007Z2556", "B0009FU10U", "B000B8IA4E", "B0045SE9XC", "B000AAJTM0", "B0019C6KAC", "B000F2DE8S", "B0011VPYIK", "B0009350CQ", "B0009NJFPY", "B000ADWD2A", "B000FYZS6M", "B000VIUNZI", "B000AQ690Y", "B0009WPZPY", "B003ALEWKU", "B000F4PDEO", "B000A7Q1XI", "B000803BQM", "B0009K7RTI", "B000MNP2KS", "B000NIBUQW", "B000BKJ76C", "B0013KPSDA", "B007ZH9OFI", "B000059TMB", "B002TPTDFC", "B000A3XYE6", "B00151QYU8", "B000F5GJO6", "B0009VRHME", "B0009W5JAA", "B0009RCPXE", "B000BW7QV8", "B0009NSE42", "B001IZNIVE", "B000BYRCRO", "B000B5IOVQ", "B000B5IOW0", "B00083FZH2"], "bought_together": ["B000WZEZFY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001G5T6GW", "B00H9KKGTO", "B00B65JMEI", "B00AEFXJS6"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 199481}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 19.5, "brand": "Son", "asin": "B000J3OTO6", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51MwbfwtGuL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Talladega Nights - The Ballad of Ricky Bobby [UMD for PSP]"}

{"description": "A disturbing film about a recovering drug addict trying to regain control of her life,Sherrybabysuccinctly depicts what can happen when want and desire aren't offset by control. In this bleak indie film, Sherry Swanson (Maggie Gyllenhaal,Stranger Than Fiction,Secretary) has just been released from a three-year stint in prison. Dressed in her inappropriate uniform of a halter top and oh-so-high platform heels, she goes to brother's house to see her 5-year-old daughter, Lexie (Ryan Simpkins). Sherry is determined to be a mother to her child, but without a home, job, or any other form of stability, she grows frustrated and jealous of her brother and sister-in-law's roles in Lexie's life. Tall and willowy, Gyllenhaal brings a sad desperation and simmering sexuality to the role. Sherry's middle-class childhood was a blur of sex and drugs, and she seems incapable of breaking out of that destructive trap. While the script by first-time feature film director Laurie Collyer isn't wholly original, the picture moves at a good pace, giving insight as to why Sherry's resigned to using sex to get what she wants. While the family secret doesn't come as a complete surprise, it is somewhat perplexing that no one addresses it. Ultimately, it's Gyllenhaal who makes you care about a character that most people would've given up on.--Jae-Ha Kim", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000I0QL7I", "B0007CEXYK", "B000E6ESU8", "B00008MTXI", "B0006IIKRG", "B000LAZDPG", "6305692572", "B00004UEDQ", "B00A2H9QN8", "B000ERVK4Y", "B003YKYX9M", "B00005JM23", "B0045HCJ08", "B003Y5H59C", "B00005Q4CS", "B000Z3N1HQ", "6305162026", "B0017X1WGK", "6305594333", "B001E95ZNS", "B007VI5AQ8", "B00JAGF9HE", "B0052ADP6Y", "B0000549B1", "B000BBOUUE", "B003AC98V2", "B00009Y3QI", "B00EUENWIY", "B00049QQHI", "B002UNMWTC", "B004V4RW8O", "B000GB5M3S", "B000J10F8C", "B00005JH9M", "0578045427", "0792838068", "B0039Y774Q", "B0000ZMGWK", "B000XSKDBA", "B0015VQAZM", "B007TSV4GK", "B003JO6OPO", "B004SUDQC2", "B001CRC4DG", "B0050ODZ6M", "B00005JMIJ", "B00ET2ODTE", "B000ICL3NI", "B00023P4I8", "B00008972P", "B00005JMU1", "B0002KPIQY", "B0040J1RX6", "B00GRZPRB4", "B00AFEXRME", "B000PKG8TM", "B000N3SU92", "B00HOGBXS6", "B004QL7JYO", "B0006IIPLM", "B00641Y2ZS", "B0000DBJ8B", "B00INUK5WM", "B00K0MM4AM", "B006GL8NQ0", "B0016I0AKU", "B00005JKN2", "B001CC7PRQ", "B000LC3I9W", "B00000IBL1", "B001C5LLVE", "B0009GX1XI", "B001FRNB9E", "B001PPLJIQ", "B006M3M5FM", "B001URA5Y8", "B0029Z8K74", "B00EMAGKNU", "B00013RC2K", "B004YCKKFK", "B004L3AR0K", "B00AEFXJ86", "B000067IZ3", "B002Q3MZXE", "B00JPSYPCM", "B001AIQ14A", "B00005U14H", "B003Z8ZC2A", "B00IARA89S", "B0010DM3R4", "B0015XHQXU", "B000FTCF3G", "B00005QJIG", "B000TLTCQI", "B004RD3YFE", "B00114XTHA", "076782170X", "B000EZ9084", "B0057ZAA6W"], "bought_together": ["B0007CEXYK", "B000I0QL7I"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000I0QL7I", "6305692572", "B00008MTXI", "B0007CEXYK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 28252}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.25, "brand": "Universal Studios", "asin": "B000JBXXYK", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516NtGsG%2BnL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Sherrybaby"}
{"description": "After the British series ofThe Officecame to an end, co-creators Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant were faced with an enviable problem:  After making the most influential and acclaimed sitcom of the past decade, what do you do next? Amazingly, they've actually created an equally brilliant show:Extras, in which Gervais plays Andy Millman, an frustrated actor who can only get work as a \"background artist\"--i.e., an extra. Not only does the role continue to mine Gervais' gift for self-humiliation (which, staggeringly enough, may be even more excruciating than his David Brent's behavior inThe Office, because Andy is more socially capable yet still can't avoid moments of jaw-dropping embarrassment), but Gervais has also persuaded a glorious variety of stars to tweak their own images. High points include Kate Winslet (Sense & Sensibility) teaching Andy's best friend Maggie (Ashley Jensen,Ugly Betty) how to talk dirty and Patrick Stewart (X-Men) describing his new screenplay about a man who uses psychic powers to remove women's clothing. But Ben Stiller, Samuel L. Jackson, Ross Kemp (sort of the British version of Michael Chiklis), and Les Dennis (sort of the British version of...well, there may not be an American version of Les Dennis) all also turn in deliciously ego-bursting turns.  Merchant plays Andy's deliriously dense agent, but the core of the show is the relationship between Andy and Maggie. Over the course of six episodes, the interplay between this hapless, starry-eyed pair grows into a wonderfully tender portrait of friendship that perfectly balances the show's so-funny-it-hurts humor. The extras are few but worth watching:  Along with a behind-the-scenes featurette, genuinely funny deleted scenes, and the usual clips of everyone forgetting their lines and swearing, there's a very funny sequence of Gervais and Merchant desperately trying to replace Jude Law (who had to drop out of an episode) with Leonardo DiCaprio.

{"description": "Sean Penn gives another powerhouse performance inAll the King's Men, leading a topnotch cast in writer-director Steven Zaillian's underrated adaptation of thePulitzer prize-winning 1946 novelby Robert Penn Warren. When you consider that the previous1949 film versionearned well-deserved Academy Awards for director Robert Rossen and actors Broderick Crawford and Mercedes McCambridge, it's no surprise that Zaillian's film was expected to earn similar acclaim, but lukewarm critical reception and disappointing box-office gave it the stigma of a noble failure. And while the film (which moves Warren's story from the Depression-era '30s to the early 1950s) suffers from uneven pacing, partial miscasting, and an occasional lack of dramatic tension, it still qualifies as a first-class production that resonates with the timeless relevance of Warren's piercing political classic. Like Broderick before him, Penn is riveting as Louisiana governor Willie Stark, an upstart political dynamo (freely inspired by controversial real-life Louisiana governor Huey P. Long) whose rise to power is ultimately doomed by corruption and betrayal.Jude Law costars as political reporter Jack Burden, our firsthand witness to Stark's rise and inevitable fall; his orbit of political insiders includes a corrupt judge (Anthony Hopkins) with a dark secret to hide; a longtime friend (Mark Ruffalo) and former lover (Kate Winslet) who fall victim to Stark's influence; and political staffers (James Gandolfini, Patricia Clarkson) who remain powerless against Stark's ill-fated populist juggernaut. At Sean Penn's request, former child star Jackie Earle Haley (from the originalBad News Bears) makes a welcome return to movies as Willie Stark's quietly intense bodyguard, \"Sugar-Boy.\" Coproduced by Louisiana-born political consultant James Carville, filmed on authentic Louisiana locations and boasting all the stately, luxurious production values of a would-be Oscar contender,All the King's Menclearly benefits from Penn's fiery performance and Zaillian's earnest embrace of Warren's still-potent subject matter. And while the film's shortcomings may have prevented it from achieving unanimous acclaim, this is still a serious, well-crafted drama with much to say about the insidious potential for fascism in America, especially when well-meaning politicians lose their souls to power.--Jeff ShannonOn the DVDThe special features that accompanyAll the King's Menfurther demonstrate the film's in-production status as a potential classic. While the \"making of\" featurette is perfunctory at best, the other featurettes are definitely worthwhile despite Sean Penn's conspicuous absence. In \"Shake Hands with the Devil,\" the film's cast, producer, and writer-director Steven Zaillian discuss the timeless theme of political corruption; \"An American Classic\" is a concise profile of Robert Penn Warren, paying tribute to the poet and author's literary achievements; and \"The Legend and Lore of Huey Long\" examines the life and legacy of the still-beloved governor who won the hearts of working-class Louisianans while falling prey to his own ambition. \"LA Confidential\" is a brief featurette about the film's use of authentic Louisiana locations and the positive effect they had on cast and crew; three deleted scenes were obviously cut from the film for purposes of time, yet offer ample proof of Zaillian's established skill as one of Hollywood's top screenwriters; and the alternate ending extends beyond the film's final shot, with a funeral scene that serves as a melancholy (and ultimately unnecessary) coda to the film's Greek-tragic drama.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000BITV92", "B000BITUHK", "0156012952", "B00000IQC0", "B0010DM3R4", "B004IFYMWK", "B000N6U0E2", "B0000DZTLW", "B00005JOC9", "B000N3SU92", "B002O5M4T4", "B006OFN0SE", "B001TH92N4", "B003ASLJQS", "B002DU39GW", "B008FYZI3M", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B001N44BVQ", "1582880816", "B005FITIGO", "B000CEXEWA", "B0000AM6JI", "B00013RC2U", "B0006210ZG", "6303477151", "B00003CXPV", "B00005JNQA", "B006GL8NQ0", "B0060ZJ7DA", "B004SUDQD6", "B004P7CMUU", "B00AEBB9AK", "B0000844LU", "B00121QGPY", "B004EPYZP8", "B002NO4ISG", "B000A2UBN4", "B0013XZ2QK", "B001UV4XRY", "B006QVRVJK", "0800141806", "B000P5FH3K", "B00005PJ8T", "B001U2M15O", "B00GUO2SKA", "B00BB67UNW", "B007CEFTSA", "B001QUF3SW", "B00DDY45DI", "B001UDS4BS", "B009AMANBA", "B00006FD9P", "B0001CNRRU", "B00G4Q3KOC", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00G7QPUII", "B00EV4EUT8", "B000M341SC", "0790736411", "B000OYAT3U", "B000BYA5G4", "B001BSBC16", "B0006IIPIK", "B00080ZG10", "B00AEBB8SS", "B005S9ELVC", "B00DHHWXYY", "B000059TFO", "B001PPLJIQ", "B000MXPE7O", "B0000DI87S", "B00GPWEPZ8", "0780626117", "6305767866", "B00GSBMNOQ", "B000NQRR1Q", "B00AEFXT1S", "B0073U2EWM", "B0031OCY2E", "B0016Q2D66", "B000HT386M", "B000BYY11Y", "630542828X", "0767810872", "B00275EGWY", "B0001EFV7C", "0783227973", "B00000K0DR", "B00AEFXBPM", "B0007R4SVI", "B00006JDU8", "B00003CXFV", "B0007TKNGK", "B00005JKQS", "B004SEUJXM", "B000VBB6F6", "B00441GYYC", "B00005JL78", "B004FQX59I"], "bought_together": ["B000BITV92"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000BITV92", "B000V5WH7S", "B002DU39GW", "B000XJD34I"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 50686}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.81, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B000K2UGXO", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51drUj0iIKL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "All the King's Men (Special Edition)"}

{"description": "In the final 13 episodes ofJustice League Unlimited, Grodd recruits Lex Luthor, Sinestro, Bizarro, Giganta, and hordes of other villains to form the Legion of Doom, leading to numerous action-packed episodes of villains fighting the superheroes of the expanded JLU.  The core members of the original series--Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Martian Manhunter, Hawkgirl, Flash, and Green Lantern--are supplemented by such heroes as Green Arrow, Black Canary, Supergirl, Red Tornado, and Mister Terrific.  But even waves of super-beings would be a bore if the stories weren't compelling and well-thought-out, and dashed with humor.  It's the respect for the viewer's intelligence that elevatesJLUbeyond a kids' series to arguably the best animated-superhero show ever.During the season, Hawkgirl meets Katar Hol, Hawkman, who claims that he and Hawkgirl are the resurrection of centuries-ago lovers, which throws a wrench into her developing relationship with Green Lantern (\"Shadow of the Hawk,\" \"Ancient History\").   Flash fights a rogue's gallery of his arch enemies alongside Batman and Orion (\"Flash and Substance\"), Luthor switches brains with the Flash in \"The Great Brain Robbery\" (inside joke: Michael Rosenbaum is the voice of Flash, but plays Lex Luthor in the seriesSmallville) ,  and Luthor's and Grodd's struggle for dominance of the Legion of Doom comes to a head in the final two-parter, which leads to an unlikely partnership against the ultimate supervillain.  The series also dips into other characters and realms of DC comic-book lore, such as the Legion of Super-Heroes (\"Far from Home\"), Deadman (\"Dead Reckoning\"), the Seven Soldiers of Victory (\"Patriot Act\"), Birds of Prey (\"Grudge Match\"), and Mike Grell's Warlord (\"Chaos at the Earth's Core\").  In the bonus features, the series creators discussJLU's ongoing Cadmus story line, there's a music-only track of the series' final episode, and the creators do a 30-minute on-screen commentary talking about three late-season episodes.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000GYI33Q", "B000F4RH8O", "B000CSTK3S", "B000B7QCGS", "B000LE1798", "B000GYI336", "B000F4RH8E", "B000PFSYO4", "B000CSTK42", "B0002ZMHX6", "B002LWJ510", "B005SH63HO", "B004VWKD3M", "B0001A7V1U", "B000B7QCHC", "B0018TNMCA", "B0007XG43W", "B002YOKVUY", "B0002ZMHWM", "B00005Y71H", "B001LK8SQ6", "B0016OM3WC", "B002FGUHBE", "B000UPMZ1M", "B00023E894", "B006PA0WF2", "B000FZETS4", "B00CENSU1W", "B00280LZBI", "B00CPEK3NI", "B000M2E32W", "B000CEXFZ6", "B0006U3SJO", "B000A9QKLO", "B003UN2ICM", "B00GD9GNEY", "B003ITZBVS", "B004XKVRBE", "B009OAWMK8", "B007RG8ZF2", "B000F0V0LS", "B000A9QKLE", "B0009UZG28", "B00LT1JHLW", "B000A9QKL4", "B003Z8ZCDO", "B003XMZVHY", "B004AUCDK6", "B000096IBN", "B005SH6482", "B00005Y71G", "B003M8NGLC", "B000PE0G0A", "B007KW5MOU", "B000A59PLU", "B007MCUAD6", "B004QOB8PW", "B00IGVJH0E", "B00GD9GNUS", "B00BBAQD6S", "B003HKN548", "B0002MFGE6", "B001QIVEVO", "B005CSYQ2S", "B004L9GM3A", "B000YDBP84", "B001A5ES9I", "B004EE2ZY2", "B00I40K6RU", "B0007XFZMS", "B000TSTEJG", "B00ISDJUYI", "B003XTUAHS", "B000UPMZ1C", "B002DYKPF6", "B00A8GBVOK", "B00023E88U", "B0007US7CQ", "B0058YPN4G", "B004MYYHGI", "B00CENWUYK", "B0036EH3XY", "B005SH63KG", "B005BXY1RE", "B001QIVEVE", "B0027FG29Y", "B0027WNRV8", "B003UN2ILS", "B000OPODNG", "B00GJ6HQDI", "B000CEXFZG", "B001614E68", "B0016PURB0", "B000JLTR86", "B008FYZHLK", "B002YOKVUE", "B00KH57U60", "B00GZ0ML2Y", "B0036EH3XO", "B000TSTEMS"], "bought_together": ["B000GYI33Q", "B000F4RH8O"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000F4RH8O", "B000CSTK3S", "B000GYI33Q", "B003L7DK88"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 14468}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 11.69, "brand": "Justice League", "asin": "B000LE17A2", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61pwRW5naBL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Justice League: Unlimited: The Complete Second Season"}
{"description": "Martin Scorsese makes a welcome return to the mean streets (of Boston, in this case) withThe Departed, hailed by many as Scorsese's best film sinceCasino. Since this crackling crime thriller is essentially a Scorsese-stamped remake of the acclaimed 2002 Hong Kong thrillerInfernal Affairs, the film was intensely scrutinized by devoted critics and cinephiles, and while Scorsese's intense filmmaking and all-star cast deserve ample acclaim,The Departedis also worthy of serious re-assessment, especially with regard to what some attentive viewers described as sloppy craftsmanship (!), notably in terms of mismatched shots and jagged continuity. But no matter where you fall on the Scorsese appreciation scale, there's no denying thatThe Departedis a signature piece of work from one of America's finest directors, designed for maximum impact with a breathtaking series of twists, turns, and violent surprises. It's an intricate cat-and-mouse game, but this time the cat and mouse are both moles: Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) is an ambitious cop on the rise, planted in the Boston police force by criminal kingpin Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a hot-tempered police cadet who's been artificially disgraced and then planted into Costello's crime operation as a seemingly trustworthy soldier. As the multilayered plot unfolds (courtesy of a scorching adaptation byKingdom of Heavenscreenwriter William Monahan), Costigan and Sullivan conduct a volatile search for each other (they're essentially looking for \"themselves\") while simultaneously wooing the psychiatrist (Vera Farmiga) assigned to treat their crime-driven anxieties.Such convenient coincidences might sink a lesser film, butThe Departedis so electrifying that you barely notice the plot-holes. And while Nicholson's profane swagger is too much \"Jack\" and not enough \"Costello,\" he's still a joy to watch, especially in a film that's additionally energized by memorable (and frequently hilarious) supporting roles for Alec Baldwin, Mark Wahlberg, and a host of other big-name performers.The Departedalso makes clever and plot-dependent use of cell-phones, to the extent that it couldn't exist without them. Powered by Scorsese's trademark use of well-chosen soundtrack songs (from vintage rock to Puccini's operas),The Departedmay not be perfect, but it's one helluva ride for moviegoers, proving popular enough to become the biggest box-office hit of Scorsese's commercially rocky career.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002ZG99N6", "B000P0J09M", "B004SIP7TE", "B004SIP8ZM", "B002ZG980U", "B002VWNIEA", "B00011CZRE", "B00AEBB8NI", "B002T9H2LA", "B00005JLSB", "B000MZHW40", "B00080ZG10", "B003ASLJQS", "B000P0J0AG", "B000P0J0EW", "B000C20VPA", "B003UESJHO", "B004SIP7ZS", "B003ASLJO0", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B002CPMB9O", "B00AHTYI5M", "B00275EGWY", "B000XR9L50", "B000A3XY5A", "B0007DFJ0G", "B001N44BVQ", "B00003CXWV", "B008MILL8W", "B000286RP2", "B004SIP7VM", "B00005V9HH", "6305313687", "B00AEBB9NM", "B004FQX5B6", "B00AEFXKUI", "B004SIP95G", "B00AEBB86A", "B005LAIIJY", "B0016Q2D66", "B003ASLJQI", "B00008975Z", "B000IY04Q8", "B001P9KR8U", "B00005JNJV", "B000C20VRS", "B008R65XYC", "B005LAIGRS", "B00H9KKGTO", "B00008DP4C", "B00AEBB9F0", "B00AEFY5B6", "B00005JN0W", "B005LAIGLE", "B000A2UBN4", "B002QEHPQU", "B000P0J0EM", "B003UESJH4", "B007D5E7C2", "6304765258", "B000P0J0D8", "B00AEFY0XE", "B00004WG2F", "0767830555", "B000LC55F2", "B002O3Z4Y8", "B004EPYZP8", "B000A7DVR2", "B00005JPD0", "B000WZEZGI", "B00049QQHI", "B000FS9FCG", "B00004XPPB", "B006OFN0SE", "B009AMAL4Y", "B004U7MR14", "B000GFLKF8", "B003AWRMCE", "B0019L770A", "B00BEIYN9Q", "B0000AM6JI", "B004SIP9Z6", "B001GZ6QC4", "0783240295", "B0010DR4BO", "B000065U1N", "B00001ZWUS", "B00BB67UNW", "B0000B1OFL", "B00AEBB9K0", "B00DHDDE32", "B00005JKWX", "B0051MKNV8", "B002ZG97RE", "0767802519", "B0034G4P94", "B00DHHWXYY", "B00005B6JZ", "B00003CXZ4", "B001TODCII"], "bought_together": ["B000P0J09M"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000RETOHY", "B000P0J09M", "B000P0J0EW", "B00AEBB8NI"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 5067}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.5, "brand": "Warner Bros", "asin": "B000M341QE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RZnzpL34L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)"}
