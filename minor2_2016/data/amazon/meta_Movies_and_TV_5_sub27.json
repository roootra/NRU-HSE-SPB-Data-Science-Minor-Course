{"description": "There are no Vikings inThe Viking Queen, a low-budget adventure from Hammer studios set in the British Isles during the Roman reign of Nero. Salina (Carita), the curiously Italian-accented daughter of a dying British king, inherits his kingdom on the eve of a treaty that splits power between the native monarchy and the Roman government. American star Don Murray (ofBus StopandThe Hoodlum Priestfame), looking oddly uncomfortable in a Roman tunic, is the fair-minded Roman governor-general Justinian, whose jurisprudence and willingness to compromise infuriates his bloodthirsty second in command. Plots from within both camps threaten not just the uneasy peace between the Britons and the Romans but the hot-and-heavy love affair between Salina and Justinian (whose flirtatious chariot race leads to a little riverside nooky). This sword-and-sandal-meets-bearskin-and-clubs adventure is at its best on location in the British countryside, where the grand scenery belies its meager budget, but the battle scenes suffer from a tiny cast of soldiers and lackluster choreography. There are plenty of scantily clad maidens (who knew the ancient British climate was so temperate?), Druid ceremonies with human sacrifices, and even a kinky flogging, but ultimately director Don Chaffey's attempts to inject Hammer's lurid edge into the drama come off as both perfunctory and forced. Though often entertaining, this period adventure never reaches the smart, sexy, and showy gothic splendor of Hammer's horror classics.--Sean Axmaker", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 433857}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "asin": "0764005448", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514D141D5BL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Viking Queen [VHS]"}

{"description": "Despite rave reviews as one of the most stylish and intelligent detective pictures in a number of years, this 1995 adaptation of Walter Mosley's novel never found a mass audience. Too bad, because Carl Franklin's film is nearly perfect in every way, from its rich, shadowy look to its depiction of life in post-World War II black America (L.A.-style) to the acting of Denzel Washington, Don Cheadle, and others. Washington plays Easy Rawlins, an aircraft factory worker who is laid off only to find his true calling: as a private eye, albeit an unlicensed one. Hired to find a missing woman, he becomes entangled in a complex but satisfying case involving sex, corruption, racism, and of course money. Top-notch from top to bottom--and Cheadle is dangerously funny as Easy's best friend, a killer named Mouse.--Marshall Fine", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000542CJ", "6304884400", "B0000549B2", "B00441GZ1Y", "B000244GCC", "B00BTYOYG2", "B0001VTPUO", "B0000VJG72", "B003BV8I3Q", "B0006210ZG", "B00008WJEY", "B004YCKJGU", "B000OT6V0K", "0783230532", "6304765258", "0743451791", "B00005JA9F", "B002GHHHN8", "B00005JPD0", "B000N60HAO", "B00015HVJM", "078324228X", "B00005JLRZ", "630514415X", "0792838076", "B0050MB4OO", "B00005RDAO", "0800177967", "B00125WAWS", "0800141806", "B00L2FSQ08", "B00005AUK9", "B00AEFY6TW", "B0009S4IGA", "B000P0J0CE", "B000BOH8X2", "B000B8TIKY", "B002CPMB9O", "B002LMV7R0", "B00007L4KF", "B00AEFXN9G", "B000GFLKF8", "0743451767", "B00AEFYLBU", "B005KKVAH2", "B00AFEXRME", "B0041QSZS8", "B000002B1D", "B00441GYXI", "B00005JN0W", "0783240295", "B00005JL72", "B00005OSKB", "B00007AJG1", "079074208X", "B00AEBB9N2", "6305505802", "B000244EX8", "B002VWNICC", "B002NZK5UU", "B00441GZ00", "0743451775", "B0000633QV", "B0002V7O5Q", "B005LAIGRS", "B0001XAQ96", "0767811070", "B00005JKWX", "0767818083", "B000065V3J", "B000JJSL1W", "B00124ONGA", "B002VWNIEA", "B00AEFYG3S", "B002CA68N4", "B000XJD34I", "B00005JLX8", "B00066FAQW", "0385535988", "038553597X", "B00005JD5J", "B000059TGC", "B00005U156", "B000ION79E", "B00003L9CG", "B000E40QC4", "B0000TWMQ6", "B004TTOQ4O", "B000VNMMVQ", "6305505780", "B00CP4Y5WS", "0743442547", "B000051YMP", "B002CWKU2M", "B00GOZ2LPM", "0446617903", "B0009GX1CE", "B00005JLG1", "B000GTJSD0", "B000JJSLA8"], "bought_together": ["B00441GZ1Y", "B003BV8I3Q"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001D7T6CM", "B00DDT0J92", "B00128GITG", "6304884400"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 59172}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 44.99, "brand": "WASHINGTON,DENZEL", "asin": "0767818075", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51lYS%2BR4XVL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Devil in A Blue Dress"}

{"description": "Forever embroiled in controversy,Midnight Expressdivides viewers into opposing camps: those who think it's one of the most intense real-life dramas ever made, and those who abhor its manipulative tactics and alteration of facts for the exploitative purpose of achieving a desired effect. That effect is powerfully achieved, regardless of how you may feel about director Alan Parker and Oscar&reg;-winning screenwriter Oliver Stone's interpretation of the story of Billy Hayes. It was the American Hayes--played by the late Brad Davis in an unforgettable performance--who was caught smuggling two kilograms of hashish while attempting to board a flight from Istanbul, Turkey, in 1970. He was sentenced to four years in a hellish Turkish prison on a drug possession charge, but his sentence was later extended (though not by 30 years, as the film suggests), and Hayes endured unthinkable brutality and torture before his escape in 1975.Unquestionably, this is a superbly crafted film, provoking a visceral response that's powerful enough to boil your blood. By the time Hayes erupts in an explosion of self-defensive violence, Parker and Stone have proven the power--and danger--of their skill. Their film is deeply manipulative, extremely xenophobic, and embellishes reality to heighten its calculated impact. Is that a crime? Not necessarily, and there's no doubt thatMidnight Expressis expertly directed and blessed with exceptional supporting performances (especially from John Hurt as a long-term prisoner). Still, it's obvious that strings are being pulled, and Parker, while applying his talent to a nefarious purpose, is a masterful puppeteer.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0008ENHUI", "0988981440", "0792833287", "B006TTC5HC", "B00007ELEY", "B004FQX5B6", "B000RTB0R6", "B000CNESTE", "B000001FBZ", "B0071HPP3M", "B00AEFXVOI", "B00AEBB95K", "B0019UGYK0", "B003ELKNH2", "0767830555", "B000059TFO", "B00079Z9VO", "B00013RC2U", "B0006GANN2", "B00005MEOU", "B00AEFXN9G", "079284646X", "B000C20VPA", "B000P0J0AG", "B0006GAOJA", "B00008O38F", "B00AEBB9UK", "B00AEFXX9Q", "B007N31YH0", "B000067IZ3", "0792846443", "6305132917", "B000A2UBN4", "B002AT8KAG", "B00AEFXV3E", "B000C20VRS", "0792838408", "B000286RP2", "B0038Z5T4Q", "B00066FBQG", "B000P0J0EW", "B00049QJ9I", "B001PYD0PC", "0800141806", "B00AEFYRP0", "B0000YEEGM", "B0000DI87S", "B0002V7ON8", "B00407PNY2", "B001R3YRG2", "B003O7I6SE", "B00AEFXEZE", "6304765258", "B000EHSVS2", "B00005U2KC", "B003TRMLQM", "B00005M2CO", "B000063US2", "B0045HCJFS", "B00AEFXBPM", "B0001US62I", "B000E5N684", "B003LMPKSQ", "B001G1FL3S", "B00009W5CA", "B000022TSY", "B00005LC4D", "B000KGGJ0Y", "B00GUO2SKA", "B00011CZRE", "B000ZM1MG4", "B00005JXY5", "B00005NB8K", "B00006ADD5", "B000P0J09M", "B000PAAJZ6", "B004SIP8ZM", "B0013XZ2QK", "B007UW9W5U", "B00B0U2SFE", "B000059HAN", "B0010YVCI4", "B00004ZBVF", "B0009UZG3C", "B00H9KKGTO", "B00AEFXD1O", "B000XJD34I", "B00IA7MFEO", "B00002VWE0", "B000M341QE", "B0007KIFGE", "B00007BKVC", "B003ASLJJK", "B00AEBBADG", "B007TBIUSM", "B00AEFXG2U", "B000LP6KNU", "B00005JLRE", "B003INBNOS"], "bought_together": ["B0008ENHUI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0988981440", "078322947X", "B003ELKNH2", "B00005PJ8T"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 132494}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.28, "brand": "", "asin": "0767817486", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/714SYCVAS8L._SY300_.gif", "title": "Midnight Express"}

Terry Zwigoff delves into the odd world of the cartoonist in his documentary filmCrumb, and the picture that emerges is not always pretty--at moments, it's almost repellent--but it's a fascinating glimpse into a very strange mind.

Given his surroundings, it's remarkable that he has survived so well. His hostilities toward women may turn some viewers off, but his wife, Aline, seems to be a grounding point, and she provides a solid counterbalance to the man.  No one shies away from discussing incredibly intimate things (namely, sex!), which explains much of R. Crumb's cartoons.

{"description": "Bugsyrepresents an almost miraculous combination of director, writer, and star on a project that represents a career highlight for everyone involved. It's one of the best American gangster movies ever made--as good in its own way as any of theGodfatherfilms--and it's impossible to imagine anyone better than Beatty in the movie's flashy title role. As notorious mobster and Las Vegas visionary \"Bugsy\" Siegel, Beatty is perfectly cast as a man whose dreams are greater than his ability to realize them--or at least, greater than his ability to stay alive while making those dreams come true. With a glamorous Hollywood mistress (Annette Bening) who shares Bugsy's dream while pursuing her own upwardly mobile agenda, Bugsy seems oblivious to threats when he begins to spend too much of the mob's money on the creation of the Flamingo casino. Meyer Lansky (Ben Kingsley) and Mickey Cohen (Harvey Keitel) will support Bugsy's wild ambition to a point, after which all bets are off, and Bugsy's life hangs in the balance. From the obvious chemistry of Beatty and Bening (who met and later married off-screen) to the sumptuous reproduction of 1940s Hollywood, every detail in this movie feels impeccably right. Beatty is simply mesmerizing as the man who invented Las Vegas but never saw it thrive, moving from infectious idealism to brutal violence in the blink of an eye. Director Barry Levinson is also in peak form here, guiding the stylish story with a subtle balance of admiration and horror; we can catch Bugsy's Vegas fever and root for the gangster's success, but we know he'll get what he deserves. We might wish that Bugsy had lived to see his dream turn into a booming oasis, but the movie doesn't suggest that we should shed any tears.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00004U103", "B00013RC2U", "B004G7XCRQ", "B0000AMJEK", "B002954A4Q", "B007TBIUSM", "B00000JGHJ", "B000068QPV", "B0000DI87S", "B000E5KQHI", "B00AEBB9NM", "B000EHSVRI", "B000C20VPA", "B0010YVCI4", "B00008RH3L", "B001C0I61M", "B00004XPPB", "B000E8NRBC", "B00CMDPT3Q", "B000P0J09M", "0792838076", "6305297142", "0792846877", "B000GG4Y32", "B0019CUG02", "B000286RP2", "B002EAYDN4", "B004YCKKFK", "B008XTVWMU", "B002QEHPQU", "B004JKS996", "6305428522", "B000C1VAFG", "B0001EFV7C", "B00AEFY7NM", "B0007G89FK", "B00007G1YP", "B00080ZG10", "B001EKP5D2", "B00005JP93", "B008R65XYC", "B00005AA9C", "B00009Y3PV", "B00005T7I1", "B0000AM6JI", "B000N3T0H8", "B004FQX59I", "B00005V9HH", "B00005IA7Y", "B000C20VRS", "0792838068", "B002CPMB9O", "B00CCMKPO0", "B000063K2Q", "B008YAPRQK", "B000ERVKBC", "B002VWNICC", "B000P0J0AG", "B0006OEXTE", "B000NQPZCO", "B0018CMJSU", "B00AEFYTMQ", "B007NE08LM", "B00H9KKGTO", "B0006HBV3C", "B0002V7O5Q", "B00AEBB95K", "B001EIOOV8", "B0006GAOJA", "B00AEFXN9G", "0767830555", "B005S9ELVC", "B004SIP7TE", "B0006GANN2", "B0019UGYK0", "B00441GYPG", "B0009HMTGC", "B0064MT1FI", "B003HE4FAC", "B0003JANSW", "1451635672", "B00E96AZBK", "B000CNESTE", "B000M341QE", "B0006HBLUK", "B00007M57P", "B00005LC4D", "B0001FGBUW", "1467907898", "B007N31YH0", "B007UW9W5U", "B00BMJ7ZKG", "B00FRILRL6", "B00008975Z", "0792844831", "B0000542CB", "1607105829", "B001DW2BJW", "B000AQ69SG", "B00AEFXVOI"], "bought_together": ["B00004U103", "B0000AMJEK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0002V7T0G", "B00004U103", "B00013RC2U", "B000EHSVRI"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 217388}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.74, "brand": "", "asin": "0767818059", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51XE61M6B7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Bugsy"}

{"description": "Directed by and starring Jackie Chan, and set in 1930s Hong Kong,Miraclesis a gangster film that is equal parts comedy and action film, with a touch of melodrama thrown in for good measure. Chan stars as a young man who rescues a dying crime boss in 1930s Hong Kong. When the boss passes away, he is tapped to become the new leader. He attributes his good luck to an old rose seller and the roses he buys off of her. To pay her back for all of his good fortune, he helps her pretend to be a wealthy socialite, just as she had described herself in letters to her daughter in order to help impress her daughter's wealthy fianc&eacute; and not queer their upcoming marriage. The plot is lifted from Frank Capra'sLady for a Day(1933), which Capra remade in 1961 asPocketful of Miracles. Of course, like all Jackie Chan films, this movie contains more--and more innovative--fight scenes than Capra could ever dream of. Two set pieces in particular are stunning: A big fight in a restaurant and the final battle in the warehouse of a rope factory. Along the way, Chan throws in a musical number inspired by Busby Berkeley and a whole lotta heart, making this a well-rounded and entertaining film, which Chan himself has allegedly referred to as his favorite.--Andy Spletzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["0767819640", "0767851161", "B000EWBKIK", "0780619331", "B006LOC01G", "B000UXOM88", "B004SUDPZU", "B004U7MR1O", "B00005YUNV", "B0051SFTGQ", "B000I2KOB0", "B00H4KQMX8", "B000VUDSH6", "B000UNYK3U", "B00AWHDEIQ", "B00005JL8Z", "B004SUDQAY", "B000HC2M3Y", "B0000TPA2E", "B00HVFA37C", "B000Q7ZKWK", "B0002S64TQ", "B005ZMBEXA", "B000BVM1QO", "B001BEK8HO", "B005FQ1OOK", "B004SUDQ4K", "B004SUDQCC", "B00008IHUC", "B000KX0IMW", "B002ZG99M2", "B0000SX9N2", "B004SIP8TS", "B00008WJE4", "B0000640VF", "B00BNADY8Q", "B005CFBZFW", "B00AWHDFIA", "B0001NBMOY", "0780622677", "B000Y11BC6", "B00D9EJG5E", "B0000V46DQ", "B00HSJ2EMI", "B002NPY7EA", "B0000U0X1Q", "B00B4VSV0U", "078062260X", "B00HVFA322", "B009INAEI8", "B0056OZI0W", "B00C7E3EBE", "B008WAM2BU", "B0010X740K", "B005F96UGO", "B005E7SEZW", "B005KK2FWG", "B002C6VMIY", "B003YOZNFQ", "B001MEJY9G", "B0016MJ6JC", "B00104AYGK", "B005F96UHI", "B003G715IK", "B00ENTX7JU", "B004TJWDNA", "B006C1S1DY", "B0019PL2W0", "B00004XMRY", "B0010X741O", "B002ZPIBRC", "B003Q7B79M", "B00003CXJ1", "B000P6R9N0", "B000N4SHNK", "B00005JLRQ", "B0036TGT7U", "B004SUDPWS", "B000WGYMTC", "B0056OZI0M", "B00IS402HQ", "B000MM0LEQ", "B0018PH3NS", "B00008EY6M", "B003EVAG4C", "B000GFLKDU", "B00CMDPTJ0", "B00000F2MG", "B003DVB7F0", "B009VL2AZM", "B00006JDVZ", "6304652747", "B00C3ALL9O", "B000MM0LEG", "B004SUDQ7W", "B000ICLU7C", "B005ZMBEXU", "B00002RAO3", "B008OTTRE4", "B00H47IXJW"], "bought_together": ["0767819640", "B004U7MR1O"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B006LOC01G", "B004U7MR1O", "B0051SFTGQ", "B000HC2M3Y"]}, "price": 0.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 477388}, "asin": "0767857178", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51TQ7VYJY3L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Miracles"}

Forget the tawdry sequels; this highly original, almost surrealist work stars Robert Englund as a mutilated monster who kills teenagers during their dreams.

{"description": "Even if the notorious 1970s porn-filmmaking milieu doesn't exactly turn you on, don't let it turn you off to this movie's extraordinary virtues, either.Boogie Nightsis one of the key movies of the 1990s, and among the most ambitious and exuberantly alive American movies in years. It's also the breakthrough for an amazing new director, whose dazzling kaleidoscopic style here recalls the Robert Altman ofNashvilleand the Martin Scorsese ofGoodFellas. Although loosely based on the sleazy life and times of real-life porn legend John Holmes, at heart it's a classic Hollywood rise-and-fall fable: a naive, good-looking young busboy is discovered in a San Fernando Valley disco by a famous motion picture producer, becomes a hotshot movie star, lives the high life, and then loses everything when he gets too big for his britches, succumbs to insobriety, and is left behind by new times and new technology. Of course, it ain't exactlyA Star Is BornorSingin' in the Rain.  Writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson (in only his second feature!) puts his own affectionately sardonic twist on the old showbiz biopic formula: the ambitious upstart changes his name and achieves stardom in porno films as &quot;Dirk Diggler.&quot; Instead of drinking to excess, he snorts cocaine (the classic drug of '70s hedonism); and it's the coming of home video (rather than talkies) that helps to dash his big-screen dreams. As for the britches ... well, the controversial &quot;money shot&quot; explains everything. And the cast is one of the great ensembles of the '90s, including Oscar nominees Burt Reynolds and Julianne Moore, Mark Wahlberg (who really can act--from the waist up, too!), Heather Graham (as Rollergirl), William H. Macy, John C. Reilly, and Ricky Jay.

The people who madeThe New Seductionoperate on the same principle, only instead of car chases and explosions, the curvaceous Jaime Pressly takes her clothes off and then, more likely than not, has sex with someone. IfSeductionhad been made 60 years ago at Warner Brothers, nobody would have gotten naked, but otherwise this gleefully trashy bit of film noir would have fit right in. The plot's a reworking of the original; this time, Ivy's sister Violet returns after 11 years to wreak havoc on the family that turned her mother (the family maid) out onto the street for sleeping with the man of the house. Pressly brings both a smoldering energy and sense of fun to her very-bad-girl part. As the lonely daughter who was Violet's best friend, Megan Edwards is both appealing and strong enough to avoid being simpy.

{"description": "Hey, chicky baby--it's a cuckoo thing, ya dig? You, too, will find yourself speaking Rat Pack lingo after watching this made-for-HBO biopic about that brief and shining moment when Camelot met Hoboken-on-the-Pacific. The film does a good job of capturing the heady, anything-goes feel of the late-1950s, early-1960s era when Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, and their running buddies ruled Hollywood, Las Vegas, and, it seemed, the world. The story centers on Sinatra's relationship with John F.&nbsp;Kennedy (William F.&nbsp;Petersen) before and after he was elected president. It's not particularly flattering to either man, as Sinatra pimps Kennedy into a relationship with Judith Campbell, at the same time she was the favorite consort of mob boss Sam Giancana. Ray Liotta is a forceful Sinatra (though it's not much of an impression); Joe Mantegna has the look and the sound of the surprisingly sober Dean Martin; and Don Cheadle does a great job as the racially conflicted Sammy Davis Jr. Not great cinema but it's never less than engrossing.--Marshall Fine", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 452068}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.0, "brand": "", "asin": "0783114176", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51D9B0ZBEGL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Rat Pack [VHS]"}
{"description": "There's a reason why Cindy Crawford was dubbed \"Baby Gia\" when she first hit the modeling scene. Indeed, Crawford, now the world's best-known supermodel, greatly resembled model Gia Carangi, who went from high school to the cover of BritishVoguein less than two years. Carangi appeared on many more covers ofVogue(French, British, Italian, and American) andCosmopolitanbefore dying of complications from AIDS (she was an IV heroin user) in 1986. Now most people recognize Carangi's name from this powerful HBO film that stars Golden Globe-winner Angelina Jolie, who comes by her talent honestly. Jolie is the daughter of veteran actor Jon Voight, and her own training as a model serves her well--she has the moves. Throughout, she's heartbreaking--as no doubt the real Carangi was--effective, and stunning.With good source material (Stephen Fried'sA Thing of Beauty: The Tragedy of Supermodel Gia), Jolie's stunning performance, and strong directing by Michael Cristofer, the movie goes beyond the merely sensational. The script was cowritten by Cristofer and novelist Jay McInerney, whoseBright Lights, Big Citycovers similar territory. As a cautionary tale,Giaworks. But to watch Jolie in her character's tragic self-destruction is utterly compelling.--N.F.

{"description": "Arnold Schwarzenegger made a successful transition to comedy with this 1990 box-office hit directed by Ivan Reitman. Arnold plays an undercover cop whose attempt to locate a little boy and his mother leads him to a small-town kindergarten class, where he poses as a teacher while continuing his investigation. He's also trying to catch a vicious drug dealer (Richard Tyson), whose ex-wife and son are the pair that Arnold's trying to rescue from impending danger. The scenes featuring Arnold and a classroom full of kindergartners are a real hoot, and Pamela Reed offers enjoyable support as Schwarzenegger's police partner, while Penelope Ann Miller (as another teacher) provides a low-key romantic interest and Carroll Baker steals her scenes as the villain's domineering mother. These familiar elements combine to make this a surprisingly lively and entertaining comedy-thriller, but parents are advised to heed the PG-13 rating: there are a lot of funny kids in the movie, but it's still a police thriller, with a violent climax that's not suitable for young viewers.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783226926", "B00026ZG10", "B00005T7HZ", "B00000G3TN", "B00HZMZ2FE", "0783230370", "B000Y11B7Q", "6305236569", "B000065V42", "B001LMAK9C", "B002GHHHME", "B00AKGG828", "B00070FX5U", "B0009DWL8W", "B000QQLVPQ", "B00ALTQRRK", "B000TJBN6W", "B00004RJ73", "B000RW3VCK", "B00015YVDG", "B00081U7HC", "0767803434", "B0000WN0UU", "B00005T7I2", "B000FO0AA6", "B0006GANOQ", "6305433925", "B00AEFXT1S", "0783219806", "078322740X", "0783230494", "B0002J58HO", "B000068QPM", "B00005N5S5", "6305428050", "B00000IQW2", "B002XUBDRY", "0783227396", "B00AEFY4CG", "0767804309", "B000056PMU", "B008R65XKQ", "0783225547", "B000K7VHTQ", "B002GHHHNS", "B00AEBB9E6", "6305428271", "B00004STDN", "6304602944", "B00008G8LM", "B00005JMCW", "B000FO0A9W", "B001SXZ7T2", "B0028ZDJN0", "B000YGGNMO", "0800177258", "B00158K0QU", "B002VWNID6", "B001OST0LW", "B0007PLLBU", "B00005PJ6N", "6305428395", "B00005JKCB", "B0043X1FLI", "B000P0J09W", "B00015YVD6", "B0045HCJGC", "0783227388", "0783229364", "B00JPQ1HX4", "B000065V3H", "0792844866", "B000YDBPAM", "B003VA3JUO", "B00005KAQP", "0783235070", "B0000AK7AA", "B00AEFY0F2", "B000RBA6C4", "0783231644", "B00008L3U1", "B00008G8M4", "B001OST0M6", "B005QX8U2Q", "0783225946", "B0001Z37HM", "6304806434", "0783227965", "B0006N2EZ0", "B000P0J0A6", "B00005T7I3", "B00000G3PA", "0767855000", "B00009WVSL", "B00005T7I1", "0790742071", "B00005JM4W", "B00AEFXPG2", "B00008O38G", "B0000UJDLM"], "bought_together": ["B00005T7HZ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0045HCJSA", "B000RJO56E", "0790732157", "B00ALTQRRK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 8184}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.49, "brand": "Universal Pictures", "asin": "0783225504", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51YE80NP76L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Kindergarten Cop"}

{"description": "Notorious Puerto Rican heroin dealer Carlito Brigante (Al Pacino) is released from jail on a technicality thanks to the manipulations of his sleazy lawyer buddy (Sean Penn). All he wants is to keep his nose clean and earn enough money to start a business in the Bahamas--and maybe rekindle romance with his old flame, played by Penelope Ann Miller. Instead he finds himself back in trouble as a result of old-world codes of honor and misguided loyalties. It all takes place in 1975 Manhattan, in and around a nightclub Carlito manages, so there's plenty of classic disco music pulsing on the soundtrack. John Leguizamo plays one of the younger generation of hoodlums out to prove something. Viggo Mortensen and Luis Guzmn star as a couple of Carlito's buddies from the old days. Brian DePalma, who directed Pacino a decade earlier in SCARFACE, makes this seem almost like that film's sequel.

{"description": "Two years before he let it all hang out inBoogie Nights, former rapper and Calvin Klein underwear model Mark Wahlberg played the psychotic boyfriend in this derivative but surprisingly effective thriller, aptly described by producer Brian Grazer as &quot;Fatal Attractionfor teens.&quot; Reese Witherspoon plays Nicole Walker, the unwitting teenager who gets the hots for David McCall (Wahlberg). David only seems like a nice guy until he gets upset by the girl's overly protective father. That's when hell breaks loose and the love-struck Romeo turns into a deadly threat who justwon'tgo away. You'd think this kind of material would be beneath the talents of a fine director like James Foley (whose credits includeAt Close RangeandGlengarry Glen Ross), but Foley gives the film just the right blend of style and tension to match Wahlberg's breakthrough role as an all-too-believable teenage maniac.

{"description": "Because it was released less than a year after Oliver Stone'sPlatoonand within months of Stanley Kubrick'sFull Metal Jacket, this exceptionally well-made film about one of the bloodiest battles of the Vietnam War was largely overshadowed and overlooked. It's a pity, because in some respects this is the best of the Vietnam films of the late 1980s, at least in terms of the everyday authenticity it depicts. Stripped clean of dramatically extraneous narrative, the movie opts instead for a straightforward approach to its day-by-day account of one of the war's costliest victories--a deadly siege on Hill 937 in the Ashau Valley, where soldiers from the 101st Airborne Division engaged the enemy over the course of eleven brutal assaults between May 10th and 20th, 1969. The film specifically follows the 3rd Squad, 1st Platoon, a mixture of \"new guys\" and battle-weary \"short-timers\" who fought against terrifying odds and suffered a 70% casualty rate. From first scene to last,Hamburger Hilltraces the rise and fall of their battle experience, from the horror of firefights to the camaraderie of men who've faced death and survived. Racial tensions flare and subside, trusts are established, and courage emerges from unexpected places. Through it all, writer Jim Carabatsos and director John Irvin maintain a purity of focus that pays tribute to the soldier's life without promoting false patriotism or gung-ho theatrics. In addition, the film features a cast full of talented and well-known actors in the early stages of their careers, including Dylan McDermott (from the TV series \"The Practice\") and Don Cheadle, before gaining fame inDevil in a Blue DressandBoogie Nights. Color accuracy, image clarity, and the explosive soundtrack have been remarkably preserved in a flawless DVD transfer, lending even greater immediacy to this underrated film.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["079284646X", "B000P0J09C", "B00AEBBA36", "B00AEBB86U", "B000ELL1R6", "B007HCI42A", "B003ELKNH2", "B00005PJ8T", "B0007TKNDI", "B003ASLJOU", "B006TTC5HC", "B00001ZWUS", "B005FUTC1I", "B004U7MQWY", "B0002V7ON8", "B0089J289K", "B000065U1N", "B00005JK8K", "B00AEFXVCU", "B00005JPKE", "B000095WW8", "B000M4RG42", "B00004ZBVG", "B000UJ48UO", "B000B8QG22", "B000DZIGDU", "B00BTYNXL4", "B003BV8ID6", "0792841662", "0792839730", "B00AEBB9O6", "B002EAYDUC", "B000WMA6R8", "B00003CXTG", "B0007TKNLA", "B000O599YO", "B00AEFXRRO", "B000MRA542", "B006TTC5DQ", "B0007TKNGA", "B0014VPFPO", "B004SIP81Q", "B002GHHHPQ", "B00AEFXLKC", "B007RL2R9M", "B004X60QRE", "B003ASLJPE", "B000KGGIZK", "B000BRP4BM", "B00AEFYBA6", "B004DY1VIO", "B00006CXSS", "B005LAIGYQ", "B002OGMGV4", "B00HEPE6MM", "B00005N5S3", "B0007KIFGE", "B001PO55LE", "B00005U8F4", "B000EOTUSA", "B00BY0EBK0", "B005ZEM8YC", "B003ASLJRC", "B00275EGWY", "B0027VK15Y", "B000G0O5N2", "B005BSCPY0", "B000NTPG6Q", "B00005PJ8S", "B00005JN9P", "6305225788", "0767802470", "B003ASLJO0", "B0001GF2FQ", "B000RTB0R6", "B0004Z33EG", "6304711905", "B0001Z3I12", "B000U1ZV6M", "B00008974J", "B001IBIHQ4", "B0015XHP2C", "B00005AVZU", "B009GXTFNK", "B005DTZXMI", "B00031V21M", "B00CHYSSME", "B00102F5WK", "B004BVS2BI", "B00DDY45DI", "6304765258", "B001ULAUF8", "B00004XPPG", "B00BTYJYR6", "B00319ECI8", "B000O77QD8", "B000EHSVS2", "B00096S4BM", "B0004Z33F0", "B003XMKU16"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AEBBA36", "079284646X", "B000P0J09C", "B007HCI42A"]}, "price": 5.0, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 291696}, "asin": "0784012148", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41NV639360L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Hamburger Hill"}
{"description": "Hayley Mills was well on her way to adulthood when she found intrigue  and chaste romance on the island of Crete in this 1964 Disney attempt at  Hitchcock in one of his lighter moods. That means the principals do wind up in a hearse trapped on a narrow street by celebratory but ominous masked  paraders. And that seemingly good guys can and do turn out to be bad guys and  vice versa. But it's Disney and Mills, so there are no deaths in this  mystery, although gunplay and some scariness do earn it a PG rating. Based on  the Mary Stewart novel of the same name, this 118-minute film finds Mills and  her aunt visiting a Cretan village on holiday. In the face of hostility from  their innkeeper's brother (Eli Wallach), the pair befriend a fellow Brit. The  young man's escapades with jewel thief Wallach draw a beguiled Mills into a  sometimes perilous adventure involving a harrowing ride upon the sails of a windmill, hiding out in an underground crypt, and a showdown with a  cheetah-loving millionairess (the scene-stealing Pola Negri) aboard her  yacht.

{"description": "It always comes up when people are comparing their most traumatic movie experiences: \"the death of Bambi's mother,\" a recollection that can bring a shudder to even the most jaded filmgoer. That primal separation (which is no less stunning for happening off-screen) is the centerpiece ofBambi, Walt Disney's 1942 animated classic, but it is by no means the only bold stroke in the film. In its swift but somehow leisurely 69 minutes,Bambicovers a year in the life of a young deer. But in a bigger way, it measures the life cycle itself, from birth to adulthood, from childhood's freedom to grown-up responsibility. All of this is rendered in cheeky, fleet-footed style--the movie doesn't lecture, or make you feel you're being fed something that's good for you. The animation is miraculous, a lush forest in which nature is a constantly unfolding miracle (even in a spectacular fire, or those dark moments when \"man was in the forest\"). There are probably easier animals to draw than a young deer, and the Disney animators set themselves a challenge with Bambi's wobbly glide across an ice-covered lake, his spindly legs akimbo; but the sequence is effortless and charming. If Bambi himself is just a bit dull--such is the fate of an Everydeer--his rabbit sidekick Thumper and a skunk named Flower more than make up for it. Many of the early Disney features have their share of lyrical moments and universal truths, butBambiis so simple, so pure, it's almost transparent. You might borrow a phrase from Thumper and say it's downright twitterpated.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["155890641X", "0788812807", "6302642248", "0788802194", "6302320402", "6304401132", "078881172X", "6304500831", "6303314015", "6300274195", "0788812408", "6302526574", "6302787068", "6302961572", "6300274268", "6305229449", "6303983812", "0788803743", "6304089767", "B0000AQZYM", "B000035Z2S", "6305319138", "6300275310", "0788805843", "0788805533", "6303929338", "6302158095", "6302178924", "6304100507", "B00005JKDQ", "6304400551", "6305326940", "6304290888", "6304978286", "6304400225", "6305940932", "B00004R99N", "6303036813", "6301390725", "B00003CX7L", "B0000E32WB", "6304089201", "B00000ICHA", "B000B8QG3G", "B0000524CZ", "6302426200", "6304501153", "B00003CXQX", "B00005T7H6", "1558906150", "6300274608", "B00000JS61", "6303534422", "B0009SUS4Q", "6304400381", "B00004R99I", "B000009CTR", "6302484359", "6301991311", "B00005RDVV", "B0007A2GSM", "B00003CXHR", "0788811002", "B000035Z46", "B00005RRG3", "6300276554", "6303122647", "6303123244", "6304401736", "0788812181", "B00006IUM9", "1558901892", "6301948106", "6305942285", "6300277003", "B00003CWPW", "6304015127", "B00007AJLB", "B00005JL95", "0788810634", "6304873441", "6303295614", "6303939015", "0783236689", "6304117752", "B00016JF2W", "B000BAVLYS", "0788812440", "B0002YLCHE", "6302481805", "6304155972", "6303991408", "B00008Y47S", "B00003CXXI", "B000B8QG4A", "6302961661", "B00003CXQ6", "B0001I55VK", "B00004YNUH"], "bought_together": ["155890641X", "0788802194"], "also_viewed": ["155890641X", "0788802194", "6303314015", "0788812408", "6304500831", "6302526574", "6302320402", "078881172X", "6302642248", "6302787068", "0788812807", "6300274195", "6304401132", "6302961572", "6304089767", "6300274268", "0788805843", "B000035Z2S", "6304290888", "0788805533", "6305319138", "6303983812", "6305229449", "6303929338", "6300275310", "6302178924", "6304400551", "B0000AQZYM", "6302158095", "6303534422", "B00005JKDQ", "B0007KTBIU", "6305326940", "B00003CXQX", "6304501153", "6303036813", "B000B8QG3G", "6304100507", "B00004R99N", "6305940932", "B00003CXHR", "6304978286", "B000035Z46", "B00005JL95", "B00005RDVV", "B005JQFQ5Y", "B00003CX7L", "6304873441", "6304089201", "6304400225", "6302426200", "6301991311", "6304401736", "0788811002", "B0000524CZ", "6300274608", "6301390725", "B00016JF2W", "B00004REYY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 63167}, "categories": [["CDs & Vinyl", "Children's Music", "Disney"], ["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.94, "brand": "Disney", "asin": "0788806270", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DVF3SBVRL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Bambi (Walt Disney's Masterpiece) [VHS]"}

{"description": "Peter Panhas a special place in the realm of classic animated  Disney films: it instills an element of childlike wonder. The 1953 version of James M. Barrie's story is colorfully told and keeps on the straight and narrow of the book. Barrie's wondrous focus on child's play is the key to its longevity: kids who don't grow up, shadows that run away from their owners, pirates, a fairy, and the magic ability to fly. In short, you can't help wishing the adventure would happen to you. Fueled by a few memorable songs (the stunner being \"You Can Fly\") and the strong impression of the pixie fairy Tinkerbell and the goofy Captain Hook, Disney's version of this story neither supplants nor lessens the Broadway version with Mary Martin that was produced for television the same decade. Unlike some classics,Peter Pannever ages along the way.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302642248", "0788812807", "0788802194", "155890641X", "0788812408", "0788806270", "6302320402", "6304401132", "6304500831", "6302526574", "6303314015", "6302787068", "6300274268", "6300274195", "B000035Z2S", "6305229449", "0788805843", "6304089767", "6302178924", "6303983812", "6302961572", "6300275310", "6304400551", "B0000AQZYM", "6305319138", "B00005JKDQ", "0788803743", "B00005JKX3", "0788805533", "6304290888", "6303929338", "B00003CX7L", "6305326940", "6304100507", "6302158095", "6304400225", "6305940932", "B00004R99N", "6301390725", "B00003CXQX", "B00000ICHA", "6303534422", "B00005JL95", "6304501153", "6304978286", "6302426200", "0788812440", "6301991311", "6304089201", "6300274608", "B00003CXHR", "B00005RDVV", "B00005T7H6", "6302484359", "B00000JS61", "6303036813", "6305942285", "1558906150", "B0000E32WB", "B00005RRG3", "B00004R99I", "B003H9M1Q2", "6304873441", "1558901892", "B000035Z46", "B00335EQ0E", "B00005K9OA", "B00003CWPW", "B00005LL26", "0788811002", "0788807307", "6304400381", "0788810634", "B00CTQWJEI", "B00016JF2W", "B00004REYY", "6304155972", "6304401736", "0788812181", "B00005RRG6", "6303122647", "B000JBWWRO", "B000B8QG4A", "6303939015", "B0000VV4W2", "B00EV1YZ96", "B000009CTR", "B00003CXQ6", "B00000J2JA", "630169774X", "B0000524CZ", "B000028U3S", "B00GDT5T9Y", "0790748266", "B00005RRG5", "B0013ND30M", "6303486894", "6304492952", "B001ILFUDC"], "bought_together": ["6302642248", "155890641X"], "also_viewed": ["0788802194", "0788806270", "6302642248", "0788812408", "6304500831", "155890641X", "6302320402", "0788812807", "6304401132", "6303314015", "6302526574", "0788805843", "6302787068", "6300274195", "6304290888", "B000035Z2S", "6303983812", "0788805533", "6300275310", "6304089767", "6300274268", "6302178924", "6305319138", "6302158095", "6302961572", "6303534422", "6305229449", "6303929338", "B00005JKDQ", "6304100507", "6305326940", "B00003CXQX", "B0000AQZYM", "6304400551", "B00004R99N", "6305940932", "6304978286", "B00003CX7L", "B00005JL95", "6303036813", "6302426200", "6304400225", "B000FP5PPA", "6304501153", "B000B8QG4A", "B0007KTBIU", "6301991311", "6301390725", "B003ZHVJGO", "B00005JKX3", "0788812440", "6304089201", "B00GDT4M1A", "B00335EQ0E", "B0000524CZ", "B0000E32WB", "6304873441", "B0001HAISG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 31071}, "categories": [["CDs & Vinyl", "Children's Music", "Disney"], ["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.89, "brand": "Disney", "asin": "078881172X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51A4yXnL4YL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Peter Pan (45th Anniversary Limited Edition) [VHS]"}

{"description": "Martin Scorsese's 1990 masterpieceGoodFellasimmortalizes the hilarious, horrifying life of actual gangster Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), from his teen years on the streets of New York to his anonymous exile under the Witness Protection Program. The director's kinetic style is perfect for recounting Hill's ruthless rise to power in the 1950s as well as his drugged-out fall in the late 1970s; in fact, no one has ever rendered the mental dislocation of cocaine better than Scorsese. Scorsese uses period music perfectly, not just to summon a particular time but to set a precise mood.GoodFellasis at least as good asThe Godfatherwithout being in the least derivative of it. Joe Pesci's psycho improvisation of Mobster Tommy DeVito ignited Pesci as a star, Lorraine Bracco scores the performance of her life as the love of Hill's life, and every supporting role, from Paul Sorvino to Robert De Niro, is a miracle.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000C20VPA", "B000C20VRS", "B008R65XYC", "B000M341QE", "B0018CMJSU", "B0019L770A", "B0019L21GA", "B00004XPPB", "B000P0J0AG", "B0000DI87S", "B000P0J0EW", "B00003CXWV", "B00CCMKPO0", "B00G1C2URC", "B00004U103", "B00AEBB9NM", "B004SIP95G", "B002CPMB9O", "B0019L21H4", "B007TBIUSM", "B000286RP2", "B00011CZRE", "B004SIP8ZM", "B0006GAOJA", "B002T9H2LA", "B006TTC5HC", "B002VWNIEA", "0767830555", "B0000AMJEK", "B0000AM6JI", "B00005V9HH", "B004FQX5B6", "B000SFOW8I", "B00008975Z", "B002CA68N4", "6305313687", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00013RC2U", "0792174909", "B007D0FVRM", "B000A7DVR2", "B004G7XCRQ", "B002QEHPQU", "B003ASLJO0", "B000LP6KNU", "B000H5TH20", "B000P0J09C", "6305263248", "0783229526", "B00009W5CA", "B001C0I61M", "B000EHSVRI", "B00IEK9U0E", "B002ZG980U", "B004SIP7TE", "B004SIP7ZS", "B0006GAO5Y", "B00B0U2SFE", "B000ERVKBC", "B000A2UBN4", "B002AF4Y9G", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B0000714BS", "B000E5KQHI", "B00005JA8B", "B002O3Z4Y8", "B003AWRMCE", "B000P0J0EM", "1558908390", "B00080ZG10", "0767802519", "B003ELKNH2", "B003BV8I3Q", "B000035Z5G", "B00AEFXDO6", "B000E8NRBC", "B00000JGHV", "B00004RJ71", "B00AEBB9CS", "B004SIP93S", "B00AEFYSEA", "B004SIP6WW", "B003ASLJQS", "B0001Z4OXS", "B002VWNIDG", "0783225946", "B00AEBB9ZK", "B00AEFXXMI", "B0000A02TZ", "B000MZHW40", "B004SIP6GI", "B002ZG99N6", "B00AEBB95K", "B00AEFXP8K", "B00BB67UNW", "B00029RTAI", "B000P0J0D8", "B003ASLJOU", "B000Z8GZYW", "B003ASLJS6"], "bought_together": ["B000C20VPA", "B000C20VRS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000M341QE", "B0018CMJSU", "B000P0J0EW", "B00BCB1JJW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 120285}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.49, "brand": "WARNER STUDIOS", "asin": "0790729725", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41YHNBJW24L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "GoodFellas"}
{"description": "When Ridley Scott's cut ofBlade Runnerwas finally released in 1993, one had to wonder why the studio hadn't done it right the first time--11 years earlier. This version is so much better, mostly because of what's been eliminated (the ludicrous and redundant voice-over narration and the phony happy ending) rather than what's been added (a bit more character development and a brief unicorn dream). Star Harrison Ford originally recorded the narration under duress at the insistence of Warner Bros. executives who thought the story needed further \"explanation\"; he later confessed that he thought if he did it badly they wouldn't use it. (Moral: Never overestimate the taste of movie executives.) The movie's spectacular futuristic vision of Los Angeles--a perpetually dark and rainy metropolis that's the nightmare antithesis of \"Sunny Southern California\"--is still its most seductive feature, an otherworldly atmosphere in which you can immerse yourself. The movie's shadowy visual style, along with its classic private-detective/murder-mystery plot line (with Ford on the trail of a murderous android, or \"replicant\"), makesBlade Runnerone of the few science fiction pictures to legitimately claim a place in the film noir tradition. And, as in the best noir, the sleuth discovers a whole lot more (about himself and the people he encounters) than he anticipates.... With Sean Young, Edward James Olmos, Daryl Hannah, Rutger Hauer, and M. Emmet Walsh.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783225903", "B004L9GMBC", "0783226063", "B00000ILDD", "0800195175", "B0018O4YT0", "B0007PALZ2", "B00004Y87O", "B003ELKNH2", "B00AEFYDM2", "B0002CHIKG", "B00005ATQB", "B00005JL78", "0790729342", "B0045HCJKS", "0767830555", "B0002CHK1S", "B00005N5S5", "B000063JDE", "B000P0J0AQ", "B00005R2IS", "B0013LL2Z2", "B00I9TDMRM", "B0045HCJ9O", "B008MIMWP8", "B0045HCJ0S", "B00005JLWN", "B00005N7Z1", "B000YBKO6U", "B0006GAOJA", "B0007DFJ0G", "B001WLMOL4", "B00003CXXP", "6304698798", "B00000JSJC", "B000286RP2", "B003AWRMCE", "B0040QYROA", "0783228457", "B004SIP9Z6", "B002ZG980U", "079284646X", "B00079Z9VO", "B002VWNIAY", "B00005J75F", "B005LAIHXQ", "B000VECAD0", "B0000VCZK2", "B00005PJ8T", "0345404475", "B001DJLD1M", "0792839056", "B0045HCJ9E", "B0050FXDDQ", "B0045HCJGC", "B004SIP95G", "B007STBUHI", "B00006ADD5", "B00GHJ1YUI", "B003ZXDP0Q", "B000A7DVR2", "0790731932", "B000NA1WGS", "B00AMSLDTM", "B008JFUN50", "B0068FZ0O2", "B000QUCQX8", "B000E6ESEO", "B00AEFXN9G", "B004FQX5B6", "B0002KVUKM", "B0016I0AJG", "B007FQXEWI", "B000N6TX1I", "B002VWNIDG", "B00ENNBZ68", "B00K5EJHGO", "B001VLBDD0", "078401213X", "0780022343", "B0018CMJSU", "B005LAII3A", "B000OVLBHG", "B006TTC5HC", "B0049985XW", "B0000844I8", "B00005JKFR", "B00AEFY3MC", "B000BZISSU", "0783226837", "6305133476", "B000022TSY", "B000FS9FCG", "B00070FX5U", "B008MIMWQW", "B00AEBBADG", "B004GJYRKA", "B002Z7FWBI", "B000BR9S96", "B00000K3TS"], "bought_together": ["B004L9GMBC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005LAIHXQ", "B009JBWOU0", "B00HUCF7AO", "B0018O4YT0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 68358}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 10.21, "brand": "WARNER BROTHERS", "asin": "0790729628", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ST8TQP63L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)"}
{"description": "This feature-length tape began as a three-episode story line on the animated TV series, a superhero crossover where Bruce Wayne visits Metropolis and the Dark Knight meets the Man of Steel for the first time. The two heroes mix like oil and water, the law-and-order Superman suspicious of Batman's rather ruthless methods; but they form an uneasy partnership when Lex Luthor and the Joker team up to take on the duo. To add a personal dimension to the already edgy rivalry, Wayne romances Lois Lane under Clark Kent's very nose. The stylized animation and sharp design of the TV series give the limited animation a sleek, smooth quality and an energetic sense of movement. Timothy Daly supplies the voices for Clark Kent and (in a deeper register) Superman, with Kevin Conroy performing the same vocal trick for Bruce Wayne/Batman; but Dana Delany only has to worry about one persona as Lois Lane. The once-and-future Luke Skywalker, cult film star turned voice actor Mark Hamill, provides the Joker's cackling banter.--Sean Axmaker.", "related": {"also_bought": ["630305899X", "0790749068", "B00005Y772", "079072880X", "0790741466", "0790732475", "B0000AQS7P", "B00003CXXI", "B0000633Y6", "1560396113"], "bought_together": ["0790749068", "630305899X"], "also_viewed": ["6304139721", "B00005Y771", "0790749068", "B000A9QKL4", "B000A9QKLE", "6304442947", "630305899X"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 356822}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.48, "brand": "", "asin": "0790736896", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516AZDAANAL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Batman Superman Movie  [VHS]"}

{"description": "Fifteen years after John Carpenter squandered a great idea on a mediocre movie (Escape from New York), he does it again--this time on the Left Coast. Kurt Russell is back as the terminally cynical one-eyed action hero Snake Plissken who, this time, has been coerced into saving the world in Los Angeles. It's 2013 and L.A. is now an island maximum security prison off the coast of California. Snake has 10 hours to find a doomsday weapon that's fallen into the hands of revolutionaries before he dies of a virus with which he's been injected. But the action is clumsy and unimaginative: lots of shootouts and very little suspense. Even the bad guys aren't particularly inventive; only Pam Grier, as a transsexual gang leader, strikes any sparks. Russell growls his way through the role but can only blame himself: He cowrote the script with Carpenter.--Marshall Fine", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792845684", "6300214656", "6304288433"], "bought_together": ["0792845684"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 433813}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.95, "brand": "", "asin": "0792142926", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DEZDZYFEL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Escape From La [VHS]"}

{"description": "After the Oscar-winning The English Patient, writer/director Anthony Minghella attempted another tricky literary adaptation with The Talented Mr. Ripley, which features heartthrob Matt Damon cast against type as a psychopathic bisexual murderer. Tom Ripley (Damon) is a bright and charismatic sociopath who makes his way in mid-'50s New York City as a men's room attendant and sometimes pianist, though his real skill is in impersonating other people, forging handwriting, and running second-rate scams. After being mistaken for a Princeton student, Tom meets the shipping tycoon father of Dickie Greenleaf (Jude Law), who has traveled to the coast of Italy, where he's living a carefree life with his father's money and his beautiful girlfriend, Marge (Gwyneth Paltrow). Dickie's father will pay Ripley 1,000 dollars plus his expenses if he can persuade Dickie to return to America. As Ripley and Dickie become friends, Tom finds himself both attracted to Dickie and envious of his life of pleasure. In time, he decides that he would rather be Dickie Greenleaf than Tom Ripley, so rather than go back to his life of poverty, Ripley impulsively murders Dickie and assumes his identity. The Talented Mr. Ripley was based on the first of a series of novels featuring Tom Ripley written by Patricia Highsmith; the story was previously filmed in 1960 as Purple Noon, with Alain Delon as Ripley.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000E33VWW", "B004SIP71M", "B0014GI6I2", "B00112S8RS", "B0013XZ2QK", "B008220DGE", "B002LVVCJY", "B00008WI9N", "B001P3SA8K", "B0060ZJ7DA", "B00018D40O", "B00AQBDU4Q", "B00003CWTI", "6305803765", "B0000BXMZ8", "B000PAAJZ6", "B00005BCK9", "B009D004TA", "B00008K7AO", "B00320J6WS", "B00000IC7G", "B002AT8KAG", "B00AEFXE9U", "B0006GW2JU", "B00GUO2SKA", "0393332144", "B00AQTY3JO", "6305781095", "B00005JMW7", "0783226845", "B00000G02H", "B00G7QPXUI", "B000M341SC", "B0060ZJ7BC", "B0009W5IMO", "B00H9KKGTO", "B000P5FH3K", "B00077BOFG", "B00GMV8M2Y", "B000HRMAPE", "B000BOH904", "B0036TGSR6", "B00HOGBXS6", "B00H9L26AA", "B004SIP7F8", "0788815490", "B00G4Q3KOC", "B004SUDQ22", "B0000VD02Y", "B00AEBB9F0", "B00GSBMNOQ", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B00562D3Y2", "B000A7DVR2", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B004SIP8W0", "B004SIP7ZS", "B00AMEZDK6", "B00005LIRC", "B000QGEB1M", "B000059XTI", "B004SIP6QI", "B000189LE2", "6305213305", "B0000640VK", "B000EQHXNW", "B002O3Z4Y8", "B001MSYH7Q", "B00D2CYU2W", "B000NIVJFY", "B00005JKN2", "B002ZG9800", "B00079Z9VO", "B00005R87R", "B000034CZA", "B00AEFYC96", "B008220DIC", "0792844807", "B004SIP73U", "B000MZHW40", "B0007UC8Y4", "B0016Q2D66", "6305065551", "B0045HCJ8K", "B00006RCNY", "B0010X8NF0", "B0001DCYUU", "6305781052", "B00005V5NU", "B0012OX7EO", "B000P0J0D8", "B00008G7UL", "6305428239", "0792846443", "B0045O2PHS", "6304696515", "B000F1IQN2", "B00GM7STPI", "B00AEFY8MM", "B00003CWRX"], "bought_together": ["B000E33VWW", "B004SIP71M"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00JAQJMJ0", "0783225903", "B002ZG97RE", "B009D004TA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 52816}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.79, "brand": "Paramount", "asin": "0792165020", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516X8NQJ30L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Talented Mr. Ripley"}
{"description": "Martin Scorsese's brutal black-and-white biography of self-destructive boxer Jake LaMotta was chosen as the best film of the 1980s in a major critics' poll at the end of the decade, and it's a knockout piece of filmmaking. Robert De Niro plays LaMotta (famously putting on 50 pounds for the later scenes), a man tormented by demons he doesn't understand and prone to uncontrollably violent temper tantrums and fits of irrational jealousy. He marries a striking young blond (Cathy Moriarty), his sexual ideal, and then terrorizes her with never-ending accusations of infidelity. Jake is as frightening as he is pathetic, unable to control or comprehend the baser instincts that periodically, and without warning, turn him into the rampaging beast of the title. But as Roman Catholic Scorsese sees it, he works off his sins in the boxing ring, where his greatest athletic talent is his ability to withstand punishment. The fight scenes are astounding; they're like barbaric ritual dance numbers. Images smash into one another--a flashbulb, a spray of sweat, a fist, a geyser of blood--untilyoufeel dazed from the pummeling. Nominated for a handful of Academy Awards (including best picture and director),Raging Bullwon only two, for De Niro and for editor Thelma Schoonmacher.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["0767830555", "B000286RP2", "B006TTC5HC", "B000C20VPA", "B000P0J09M", "B0000DI87S", "B000A2UBN4", "B000CNESTE", "B004FQX5B6", "B00004XPPB", "B00AEFXN9G", "0792833287", "B00006RCNV", "B003ELKNH2", "B0050FXDDQ", "B0006GANN2", "B00003CXBU", "B0019L770A", "B00079Z9VO", "B000C20VRS", "B00AEBB9NM", "B000M341QE", "B004SIP7TE", "B000P0J0AG", "B00008975Z", "B0019L21GA", "B000WC39ZY", "079284646X", "B00AEBB95K", "B004SIP95G", "B0018CMJSU", "B002VWNIAY", "B00009W5CA", "6304907729", "B004SIP8ZM", "B000ARTN3I", "B00008RH3L", "B0000AM6JI", "B00005ATQB", "B000RTB0R6", "B003AWRMCE", "B00AEBB9CS", "B000286RR0", "B004L9GMBC", "6305263248", "B000LP6KNU", "B000P0J09C", "B0045HCJ8U", "B000P0J0EW", "B00080ZG10", "B00006ADD5", "B00004XPPC", "B00005V9HH", "B00003CWTI", "B002VWNIDG", "B003UESJHO", "B0006GAO5Y", "0792846109", "B00AEBB89C", "B002VWNICC", "B000063JDE", "B00005JKMQ", "B008R65XYC", "0767827902", "B000022TSY", "B002CPMB9O", "B00066FBQG", "B007STBUHI", "B0007DFJ0G", "B0001US62I", "B004U7MR14", "B00008O38F", "B000A7DVR2", "B001WLMOL4", "B000055Y0X", "B0087ZG7R0", "078324228X", "B0049985XW", "B003XURDAY", "B00GMT69C6", "B000063US2", "B00003CXWV", "B0045HCJTO", "B003ASLJQI", "B000CNESU8", "B000PAAJZ6", "B006FE83UE", "B00AEBB8NI", "B006TTC5MM", "0783225725", "0780618564", "B0019UGYK0", "B00001ZWUS", "6304698798", "6305941122", "B007Y1NR1W", "B003ZEQMH8", "6305918880", "B007TBIUSM", "B0087ZG7UW"], "bought_together": ["0767830555", "B006TTC5HC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00H9KKGTO", "B00008975Z", "B0018CMJSU", "B000C20VPA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 225981}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.7, "brand": "", "asin": "0792833236", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518QQEM9XPL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Raging Bull"}

{"description": "Director Tobe Hooper was a hot property after he scored a popular hit withPoltergeist(thanks in part to producer Steven Spielberg), so his follow-up film was the most wildly ambitious of his career to date. Armed with a big budget and a special effects crew led byStar Warspioneer John Dykstra, Hooper andAliencowriter Dan O'Bannon whipped up a movie that must be seen to be believed. That's not really a compliment, sinceLifeforceisn't much of a movie when all the sound and fury is over. But you've got to admit there's something crazily admirable about a movie that starts out as a science fiction adventure about a mission to explore Halley's comet, turns into an alien-invasion thriller featuring a beautiful naked woman (Mathilda May) who's a vampire from space, and escalates into an end-of-the-world disaster flick! It's got everything you could want from a horror movie--from zombies running amok in London to rotting corpses and energy bolts to signal the apocalypse to come!

{"description": "Early on inRobocop 3, an action figure of our metal hero on the nightstand in a little girl's room informs us that he's now become a children's toy. The image is right on the money; despite following up two of the most violent, hilarious sci-fi/action films ever made,Robocop&nbsp;3is strictly for the kiddies. It's not just that the gore  has been toned down considerably to make for a PG-13 rating; also excised is the straight-faced portrait of a world run by corporate fascism. When evil corporation OCP, and its even more evil Japanese parent company, plan to raze a Detroit neighborhood to put up the shining new Delta City, the residents (including the aforementioned adolescent, who conveniently happens to be a computer expert) gang up to fight back, just like the angry neighbors inDeath Wish&nbsp;V. Robocop (played this time out by Robert John Burke, Peter Weller having wisely passed) could be a hindrance to the companies' plans, so a ninja android is sent in to deal with him. Even all this could have been enjoyable, in a campy sort of way, but nothing pays off as either comedy or action--tellingly, the two big showdowns with the ninja start exhilaratingly (Robocop's clunky movements hilariously counterpoised by the android's acrobatic leaps), only to end just when they're getting good. Director Fred Dekker has some nice stylistic touches scattered about, but not nearly enough to save the film.

{"description": "The king, or maybe that should be queen, of all drag shows, New York City's 10th annual Wigstock festival, provides the setting for this lively and frequently funny documentary. Some 30,000 fans showed up, many of them suitably adorned with impossibly huge wigs, and roving cameras did a fine job of capturing the celebratory atmosphere. It goes without saying that those who find men performing as women fascinating will revel in what the camera captured. Several drag performers prepping for their star turns on the Wigstock stage are profiled, and some of them speak about what possesses them to admittedly make spectacles of themselves. There are also quirky interviews with construction workers building the festival's stage, jaded neighbors in the East Village, and even some encounters with bemused New York City cops. The film features very professionally shot performance footage of such characters as RuPaul, Deee-Lite, Crystal Waters, and even a pair of dueling Tallulah Bankhead impersonators performing \"Born to Be Wild,\" but the real star of the production is the hip sense of humor the filmmakers brought to the project. At times the interviews with people attending the shows and passersby in New York who simply shrug it all off come close to upstaging the guys in size 14 heels singing and dancing their hearts out onstage.--Robert J.

{"description": "Truman Capote's extraordinary nonfiction book about the course of two killers in this world--their lives, their senseless slaughter of an entire family, their executions--was faithfully adapted for the screen in this 1967 film by Richard Brooks (Deadline USA,The Blackboard Jungle). Robert Blake and Scott Wilson are remarkable as the murderers, but what has kept this film special over the decades is Brooks's blunt, clearheaded, and nonsensational approach to the story. (The term \"semidocumentary\" has been applied to Brooks's style on this film, and it's an entirely fair description.) The experience of watchingIn Cold Bloodis naturally unsettling, but the director--as with Capote--leaves final judgments about justice to the beholder.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305263213"], "bought_together": ["6305263213"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 379007}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 15.0, "brand": "", "asin": "0800113268", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51MMT7WJEBL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "In Cold Blood [VHS]"}
{"description": "Lurid thrillers don't get much more shameless than this movie, in which Robert De Niro plays a pathological baseball fan whose obsession is focused on a San Francisco Giants all-star outfielder (Wesley Snipes). While the newly signed baseball star is having trouble getting his favorite uniform number from a competitive teammate (Benicio Del Toro), De Niro is having career troubles at the knife company his father founded, and you can bet that his proximity to high-quality stainless-steel blades will be a factor in the suspenseful plot. Recycling parts of his maniacal roles inTaxi Driver,The King of Comedy, andCape Fear, De Niro takes his idolatry to violent extremes, eliminating any obstacle to Snipes's stardom until the baseball hero is forced to confront his most terrifying devotee. Directed with brutal excess and souped-up style by Tony Scott (Top Gun,Crimson Tide), this manipulative nail-biter pulls all the right strings in predictable fashion, but it does have moments that are effectively intense.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000A2UBN4", "B00441GYXI", "B005CA4SL0", "B00AEBB8LA", "B002AS466O", "B002AT8KA6", "B001R3YRG2", "B00005LDDD", "0767811097", "B0047T74CM", "B000B8GT92", "B0010YSD8Q", "B000069I1H", "B00009RDG9", "B002AS464Q", "B00009AOAW", "B00AKGG828", "B003VA3JZY", "B00008O38F", "B000U1ZV76", "078324021X", "B00008DP4C", "B0002KQNKE", "B00005JLX2", "0800177258", "B000055Y0Y", "B0006GAI5U", "B000U1ZV4Y", "B004SIP6WW", "B00005U5A8", "B0010YSD90", "B00AEFYKWU", "0767810872", "0790732149", "B002GHHHN8", "B000HRMAUY", "B000P0J0D8", "B00009AOAX", "B00AEFYF2K", "0792835727", "B000ZS8GWQ", "B0002J58HO", "B00AEFXKZ8", "B005I0DUMC", "B00007LB4C", "B00005JL5F", "B000ELL1R6", "B00004XPPB", "B00005QAOZ", "B00006RCNV", "B00HZMZ2FE", "0767804236", "0767836286", "B002O3Z4Y8", "B00HWWUR0M", "B000MNOX94", "B000BBOUW2", "B000OT6V0K", "B003EYVXSW", "B0017CW5R6", "B0068FZ0GK", "6305428115", "B0016Q2D66", "B00005N89M", "1558908846", "B00AEBB9AK", "B000OVLBHG", "B00000JGHL", "B00000JGPE", "0767802497", "B00CX7TOOG", "B00003CWU3", "0767830555", "B00BB67UNW", "B00GUO2SKA", "B00001U0DU", "B00015YVDG", "6304779631", "B0001FGBUW", "B000MEYKEG", "B0009YA3OA", "B009AMAJPA", "B005TTEG3O", "0783227345", "6304765258", "B00005JA9F", "B000P0J0AG", "0767807588", "6305268827", "B002NZK5VO", "B002O3Z4WK", "B00005JKQS", "B00AEFXYJA", "B0000WN0SC", "B00AEBB9NM", "B003VE9WTW", "B000BUNZY2", "0767802578", "B00005Q4CV", "B00008L3S6"], "bought_together": ["B000A2UBN4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005JN5E", "B002O3Z4Y8", "0767830555", "B000P0J0AG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 132676}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.99, "brand": "Team Marketing", "asin": "0800141822", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51-S1Lnc%2BeL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Fan"}

Kevin Bacon, Kiefer Sutherland, J.T. Walsh, and Cuba Gooding Jr. (ofJerry Maguirefame) round out the superb cast.

But it is an entertaining potboiler about a hired gun (Chow) who fails to carry out an assignment to kill a cop (which would leave the fellow's son without a father), and becomes a target himself when the contract is handed over to other assassins. Mira Sorvino plays a document forger who is drawn into the fray, pairing up with the hero as they fight their way out of bad spots. The whole enterprise is a little too routine, but the action is sharp and the battles are imaginative and crisp.

{"description": "Director David Lean's masterful 1957 realization of PierreBoulle's novel remains a benchmark for war films, and a deeply absorbing movie by any standard--like most of Lean's canon,The Bridge on the River Kwaiachieves a richness in theme, narrative, and characterization that transcends genre.The story centers on a Japanese prison camp isolated deep in the jungles of Southeast Asia, where the remorseless Colonel Saito (Sessue Hayakawa) has been charged with building a vitally important railway bridge. His clash of wills with a British prisoner, the charismatic Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guinness), escalates into a duel of honor, Nicholson defying his captor's demands to win concessions for his troops. How the two officers reach a compromise, and Nicholson becomes obsessed with building that bridge, provides the story's thematic spine; the parallel movement of a team of commandos dispatched to stop the project, led by a British major (Jack Hawkins) and guided by an American escapee (William Holden), supplies the story's suspense and forward momentum.Shot on location in Sri Lanka,Kwaimoves with a careful, even deliberate pace that survivors of latter-day, high-concept blockbusters might find lulling--Lean doesn't pander to attention deficit disorders with an explosion every 15 minutes. Instead, he guides us toward the intersection of the two plots, accruing remarkable character details through extraordinary performances. Hayakawa's cruel camp commander is gradually revealed as a victim of his own sense of honor, Holden's callow opportunist proves heroic without softening his nihilistic edge, and Guinness (who won a Best Actor Oscar, one of the production's seven wins) disappears as only he can into Nicholson's brittle, duty-driven, delusional psychosis. His final glimpse of self-knowledge remains an astonishing moment--story, character, and image coalescing with explosive impact.Like Lean'sLawrence of Arabia,The Bridge on the River Kwaihas been beautifully restored and released in a highly recommended widescreen version that preserves its original aspect ratio.--Sam Sutherland", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302909023", "6304935811", "6304071876", "0800116917", "630150528X", "6301966317", "B0000040EJ", "6303168507", "0783222955", "6300181472", "0800113055", "0783221347", "6303057225", "6301797906", "0783235593", "6300181340", "6304151306", "6304196954", "6301965760", "B00005Q4GY", "6303494390", "6301977742", "6304291698", "6300988473", "6304117752", "6302797616", "B00007JME0", "630382336X", "0790752395", "B00005A1VH", "6301115430", "6300183513", "6302529441", "B000005PFL", "B00000F13T", "6304765347", "630274721X", "0782008348", "B000059HGY", "6301662954", "6300247031", "630018224X", "6301670140", "0792838408", "6304359675", "6304039522", "6300215601", "6304366078", "6300246965", "6300215539", "6303823351", "0800100832", "6301628454", "6300216721", "630407185X", "6304233639", "6300251152", "6300268748", "0790744589", "0790734060", "B00005Q4GZ", "0792116887", "6301798066", "0790701251", "6301976983", "6301972066", "B00004RFFA", "0800125762", "079212569X", "0792133153", "0790743213", "630442972X", "6301969049", "6300214540", "0783231482", "6300270025", "B00004TYS8", "6300183211", "6301587375", "B00000K3AN", "6300182533", "6301973259", "6304397941", "6301969251", "6300271315", "6303052223", "B00004RGUU", "0783235623", "B000062XM6", "6304458975", "B00004WIDB", "6305237115", "6301965701", "6302415853", "6303029027", "B000005PE7", "B0001DI5W6", "0792837533", "6301662946"], "bought_together": ["6302909023", "6301966317"], "also_viewed": ["0790743213", "6304071876", "B00BBND56G", "B000059HH1", "6305123616", "630233683X", "0783222955", "0783221347", "6304039522", "6300183513", "B000054OW2", "1558803602", "6301662954"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 223097}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.99, "brand": "", "asin": "0800132009", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51PF507DBSL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Bridge on the River Kwai [VHS]"}

This is one of Cruise's best, most underrated performances, and in an Oscar-winning role, Cuba Gooding Jr. plays the football star who remains Jerry Maguire's only loyal client on a hard road to redemption and personal growth.

{"description": "Overview\nFormer vice president Al Gore shares his concerns on the pressing issue of global warming in this documentary. A long-time environmental activist, Gore first became aware of evidence on global warming in the 1970s, and since leaving public office he has become a passionate advocate for large- and small-scale changes in our laws and lifestyles that could help alleviate this crisis. An Inconvenient Truth records a multi-media presentation hosted by Gore in which he discusses the scientific facts behind global warming, explains how it has already begun to affect our environment, talks about the disastrous consequences if the world's governments and citizens do not act, and shares what each individual can do to help protect the Earth for this and future generations. An Inconvenient Truth was directed by Davis Guggenheim, a veteran documentary filmmaker who also has an extensive background in episodic television.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JPXA", "B0013D8LHM", "B0027BOL4G", "0670062723", "B004IN75D0", "B0042EJD8A", "B00018U8YE", "B000YKI4MM", "B00147F8WS", "B0012Q3T72", "B0002OXVBO", "B000UNYJXQ", "B003M987AG", "1594865671", "B000I5Y8FU", "B001C17EVE", "B00005JMXX", "B001MWGZ6S", "B002PLMJ74", "B00366E1AK", "B001EP8EOY", "B000BTH4K4", "B000RPCJSE", "B002RB56W2", "B001EUSYHQ", "B0019KAQB8", "B004SO26RE", "B000BI5KV0", "B005OCJJ9M", "B002RX8G5E", "B005YFGIZM", "B000PY52IG", "B0041KKYBA", "B00AZMFNX2", "B001KWB0L0", "B003FNQ0I0", "B0069UP2PI", "0812982894", "B003Q6D28W", "0674058178", "B000BJS4FS", "B003Q6D28C", "1405187360", "B005YFGIZ2", "B0019A35G6", "B000OUCEZU", "B005ZMBDJK", "1594867348", "B00FGVS0DM", "B000MQ4WX8", "B005TZFZK6", "0312428928", "B0053ZHZI2", "B0055V6EX6", "B008NNY98U", "0767805712", "B00APG8QQO", "1586481983", "B002KLALEC", "B00DPUB5LK", "B003GSLVX8", "B00AEFXPSK", "B001E0KSAM", "B008LW2520", "B0009GX1EM", "B000WLUXZE", "B003CAKXAC", "B000CPHAAG", "B00IWULQQ2", "1931930007", "B00EL6AAEU", "B00013F2S6", "B005LAIH4A", "B000B0WO4O", "B006ZAPSJW", "B000EOTEM2", "0521732557", "B0007DBJM8", "B0018PH3NI", "B00CMDPTA4", "B004JR3OKI", "B00744WZ8U", "B0025XUTKQ", "B001M0N8UQ", "B0040QYRS6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005JPXA", "B0027BOL4G", "0670062723", "B004SO26RE"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 50499}, "asin": "1415724784", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51p%2Btk39UpL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "An Inconvenient Truth"}
{"description": "Director Billy Wilder (Sunset Boulevard) and writer Raymond Chandler (The Big Sleep) adapted James M. Cain's hard-boiled novel into this wildly thrilling story of insurance man Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray), who schemes the perfect murder with the beautiful dame Phyllis Dietrichson (Barbara Stanwyck): kill Dietrichson's husband and make off with the insurance money. But, of course, in these plots things never quite go as planned, and Barton Keyes (Edward G. Robinson) is the wily insurance investigator who must sort things out. From the opening scene you know Neff is doomed, as the story is told in flashback; yet, to the film's credit, this doesn't diminish any of the tension of the movie. This early film noir flick is wonderfully campy by today's standards, and the dialogue is snappy (\"I thought you were smarter than the rest, Walter. But I was wrong. You're not smarter, just a little taller\"), filled with lots of \"dame\"s and \"baby\"s. Stanwyck is the ultimate femme fatale, and MacMurray, despite a career largely defined by roles as a softy (notably in the TV seriesMy Three Sonsand the movieThe Shaggy Dog), is convincingly cast against type as the hapless, love-struck sap.--Jenny Brown", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300215644", "0783236352", "6304039530", "6303402070", "6301975987", "6302226899", "6301973410", "6300215512", "6300183580", "6300183513", "6304457316", "B001D8W7EK", "6301640667", "6304359705", "6302909023", "6305999872", "B000003KE0", "0783221347", "6304429274", "0792837096", "6301797906", "630197350X", "0769403468", "B00AEFXN9G", "6301797957", "B00023P4FQ", "6304039506", "0790743213", "B001D8W7F4", "6305123616", "0783217390", "6302360978", "6302041090", "0800100832", "B000EVD38G", "6301773586", "0792839846", "B001D8W7EU", "B00008LDNZ", "6304119046", "6301798503", "0782008348", "630196697X", "6301969316", "6305012792", "0783235674", "B000AV4RQ2", "0792841409", "6301966430", "6300181421", "6301973232", "6301973259", "6302413400", "0792110269", "6303057225", "6302413435", "B001BZQMFA", "0800113055", "6300181405", "B000GX7MMA", "B000M7BEPQ", "6304111363", "6302227135", "6303396623", "6304039522", "1569942072", "B0045HCJ9E", "6302484383", "6302238331", "6300215741", "6301978536", "B00004TYS8", "6302700949", "0783217528", "0783235607", "6301586042", "6301976061", "B0047M6Y66", "0792841026", "6301800974", "6301798708", "0792837967", "6301798732", "6300181367", "B00005Q4GZ", "630266232X", "B0000040EO", "0790734079", "6302725542", "6300269310", "0783235682", "6301963911", "6301798562", "6301969049", "0792108280", "6300251012", "6302801133", "1558804226", "0792101448", "0764007440"], "bought_together": ["0783236352"], "also_viewed": ["B00I3C1T1Q", "6301797906", "6304429274", "6305123616", "B000005PPB", "B0050FXDDQ", "0800116917", "6301976983", "6304117752", "0783216084", "6303402070", "0792837096", "6304039522", "6301964012", "0792839846", "B009YX8MSG", "B00GST8UB8", "B00JAQJMJ0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 171937}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 24.0, "brand": "", "asin": "1558807780", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5164XM9AE3L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Double Indemnity [VHS]"}
{"description": "Judge Dreddis one of those movies that doesn't have a brain of its own, so it can only rip off a lot of ingredients from other, better movies. It's a mishmash ofBlade Runner,Total Recall, andThe Road Warrior, with a dash ofStar Warstossed in for good measure. As if that weren't enough, it's got Sylvester Stallone, who seems to be the only one in the movie who's in on the game and knows it's all a sci-fi scam. LikeThe Fifth Elementa few years later,Judge Dredddepicts a futuristic megalopolis packed with crowded vertical overgrowth and rampant commerce, where anarchy reigns supreme. Violent \"block wars\" are fought by lawless citizens with machine guns, and Judge Dredd (Stallone) is one of the city's heavily armed policemen, given free rein to judge and execute the perpetrators of violence. But Dredd himself is subjected to judgment and swift justice when his own gun is identified in the murder of a prominent TV reporter, forcing him to do whatever he can to clear his name. Diane Lane plays his partner in crime-fighting and romance, and Rob Schneider provides juvenile comic relief as Dredd's streetwise sidekick. Impressive special effects are on vivid display, and the movie's fun for what it's worth. Lower your expectations and you just might enjoy it.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0045HCJGC", "B009YQJ322", "B0045HCJG2", "B0045HCJ5S", "B00070FX5U", "B00004STDN", "B000U1ZV62", "B004SIP6WW", "B000MEYKEG", "B0045HCJT4", "B00003CXTM", "0783226934", "B00315462E", "B000056PNL", "6304779631", "B0000VV5BM", "B000056PMU", "B002GHHHME", "B00HZMZ2FE", "B0002S94CK", "B0004Z33G4", "6304602944", "B00IZZDWKM", "B005LAII3A", "B00005JA8B", "B001B3LIOC", "B00005N7Z1", "B000U1ZV8K", "B00AKGG828", "B0068FZ0O2", "B0001Z37HM", "6305767866", "B0006IIPL2", "0780622650", "B000QUCRB4", "B009MF5BXK", "B00004Y87O", "B00007AJG4", "B00H1RMWYW", "B003YOZNBU", "B002ZG999U", "B0004Z33F0", "B00BTYMPUY", "B000R348QW", "6304806434", "B003KV3E2M", "B0015XHP2C", "078401132X", "B0006GANOQ", "0767802454", "B00D3LA6RK", "B000BPL2FQ", "B00D3LA7G0", "B000022TSJ", "B00005JM5B", "B0045HCJFS", "B002AS466O", "B00BLF9FOK", "B000RW3VCK", "6304712499", "B00005JKIP", "B0004Z33EQ", "B00005N5S5", "6304711891", "B00026ZG10", "B00AEFYDM2", "B002OGMGV4", "B00IKM5LXG", "B001VLBDD0", "B001QB9H1U", "B001KRVLCI", "B005LAII8A", "B00003CXWS", "0767807588", "B00AEFY6PQ", "B0001FGBWK", "B002ZG98LO", "B008JFURII", "B0013LL2Z2", "B001M9ELQC", "B001FB55HQ", "B000CEXGAU", "B0015FQZIK", "B000QXDCLU", "B00JL6L4UY", "B001L2ZSJO", "B000BMY2N8", "B000U1ZV4Y", "B002GHHHP6", "B000FOPPBK", "B002GOAH1A", "B002UZCJ8Y", "B001T21R5U", "B008JFUN50", "B008JFUO36", "B000RETOH4", "1558908315", "B00003CXIV", "0783225547", "B008JFUQZ2"], "bought_together": ["B009YQJ322"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B009YQJ322", "B0045HCJGC", "B00005JA8B", "B0045HCJG2"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 14955}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.99, "brand": "Buena Vista", "asin": "1558908846", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51NYJDV9HTL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Judge Dredd"}

{"description": "Jacques Demy's haunting romantic musical is an enchanting, one-of-a-kind musical experience. It's basically a movie operetta, in which the characters sing all the dialogue (or, rather, lyrics--by director Demy) to Michel Legrand's lovely score. The story spans five years (1957-1962) in the life of Genevi&eacute;ve (the ethereally beautiful Catherine Deneuve in the role that launched her to international stardom), the teenage daughter of a woman who owns a Cherbourg umbrella shop. After Genevi&eacute;ve's boyfriend Guy (Nino Castelnuovo) is drafted and sent off to Algeria, she discovers she's pregnant ... and complications ensue. With its dazzling candy-colored palette,Umbrellas of Cherbourglooks sweet and dreamy. Restored and rereleased in 1995 to rapturous acclaim and the renewed delight of all who got the chance to see it. The video release is taken from the restored version.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305674051", "6301045750", "6301978536"], "also_viewed": ["B00JPUUQ5A", "B005VU9LP4", "B003SEH3EQ"]}, "price": 24.94, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 258532}, "asin": "1572520922", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51YE985VJAL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Umbrellas of Cherbourg [VHS]"}
{"description": "Before coming to America to make such acclaimed films asTender MerciesandDriving Miss Daisy, Australian director Bruce Beresford made a lasting impression with this compelling courtroom drama, considered one the finest films of the Australian new wave of the late 1970s and early 1980s. Based on a true story about three soldiers in the Boer War who are served up as political scapegoats of the British Empire, the film uses a flashback structure to dramatize the courtroom testimony.  It begins when the three Australian soldiers are railroaded for the justified killing of a German missionary and placed on trial for court-martial not as a matter of justice, but to mollify the German government for the sake of political expediency. Burdened with a competent but inexperienced and hopelessly disadvantaged lawyer, the soldiers realize that their fate has been sealed and the outcome of their trial is a fait accompli. Unfolding with urgent precision and a riveting focus on its well-drawn characters,Breaker Morantwas the all-time box-office hit in Australia at the time of its release in 1980, and it remains one of the very best historical dramas ever made.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00BTYJYR6", "B000CJ2E5I", "B00008PC13", "1593860161", "B0045HCIZE", "B0009UVCR6", "B000EOTUSA", "B000062XF0", "B00004TJKI", "B0002CR04A", "B0000639EU", "B001CTBGNS", "0792841409", "B00108FMFO", "B000KGGJ0Y", "B00005U8F4", "B0000EYUCK", "B0011FDVGI", "B000MV90B2", "B00006JU7U", "B000UJ48SQ", "B000EHSVQO", "0767802470", "B00049QQJQ", "B00004XPPC", "B00A29HFMU", "B0000B1A58", "B000E1E2N6", "B000LPR6GA", "B00006ADD5", "0330445936", "B00IBKXSKA", "B000YENUOK", "B00K6D1QV8", "630542828X", "B00005PJ6V", "0780021134", "B001LMAK6A", "B000AQ6A0I", "B000055Y0X", "B000HWZ4C0", "B000M2E30O", "B003XTOBU0", "B00AEFZDNA", "B000GG4Y32", "B004NTC7EQ", "B00DL48BM6", "B00007G1WH", "B00008UALL", "B00005JLD4", "B005DKS1TE", "B009XTF8NI", "B000V7HFL4", "B000CCUFB0", "B000O05DSK", "B0087ZG7OI", "B003B3NV6I", "B0008GGN9I", "B00D6I7ITY", "B004HHX9XC", "B00008AOTN", "B00096S4DA", "B0046YK4KW", "B004AKNRRY", "B006FE83UE", "B00C2535TE", "B00003CXBU", "B004ALIG0G", "B00004W229", "B00824FK9W", "B0024FADBU", "B002UXYCYK", "B0000A0DTC", "B0008ENHTO", "B00005NKTH", "B005T0OY5S"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00BTYJYR6", "B00008PC13", "B0000EYUCK", "B000CJ2E5I"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 104079}, "asin": "1572521775", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51%2BX9BSQzuL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Breaker Morant"}

{"description": "Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones star as Gus McCrae and Woodrow Call, aging cowboys and former Texas rangers and who organize a 2,500 mile cattle drive for one last great adventure in this excellent 1989 miniseries adaptation of Larry McMurtry's novel. The best friends, who steal the herd from a gang of Mexican cattle rustlers, drive their herd from Texas to Montana, battling horse thieves, angry Indian tribes, and a renegade half-breed killer named Blue Duck (Frederic Forrest) on a mission of revenge. The excellent cast also includes Robert Urich as cardsharp and former Ranger Jake Spoon, Anjelica Huston as McCrae's old flame Clara Allen, Danny Glover, Ricky Schroder, Diane Lane, Chris Cooper, D.B. Sweeney, Steve Buscemi, and even a small role for author Larry McMurtry. Australian director Simon Wincer shows a tremendous capacity for balancing sweeping drama and intimacy against the gorgeous landscape of the American Southwest, giving a grandly epic feel to the film despite its small-screen target and limited budget, and for forging memorable characters of even the smallest supporting parts. The heart of the drama belongs to McCrae and Call, memorably etched by Duvall and Jones as the last of the range romantics. In the age of revisionist Westerns, this excellent cattle-drive drama nicely maintains an old-fashioned feeling while still showing the dark side of the American West. Winner of seven Emmy Awards and responsible for two miniseries sequels (Return to Lonesome DoveandDead Man's Walk) and a TV series.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302940303", "B00116GEJS", "B0038EGD3I", "6304014090", "6304457278", "B000GFRI4K", "B00368PSKK", "B0000TANUI", "6304414099", "B00001OWYM", "B003Q7B6ZC", "6302415853", "B004SIP8ZM", "6303109950", "B00004WIDB", "B00AEFYBA6", "6304457308", "157492611X", "6300269884", "6300181588", "6300269043", "6300182304", "630442972X", "6304457324", "6305962596", "0792107128", "B0000TANUS", "6305237115", "6305810109", "0783227264", "6301586042", "6300182533", "1555265952", "B00004RFFA", "0800132009", "B00005A1VH", "6300184951", "B000056BRF", "B001E4TDR2", "6301599896", "6304259131", "6301797906", "0792107683", "6302250269", "6303393985", "6300267938"], "bought_together": ["6302940303", "6304014090"], "also_viewed": ["B0038EGD3I", "B00116GEJS", "B00368PSKK", "B00DZUV0M4", "B003Q7B6ZC", "B000060MUB", "B0012CJQXW", "B00027JY5I", "B0037HERB6", "6302940303", "B00368PSKU", "6304014090", "157492611X", "B000BNI90Y", "0800135954", "6301792734", "1574925911", "6304457278"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 348735}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 0.75, "brand": "", "asin": "157492589X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51B68ECR07L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Lonesome Dove (EP version) [VHS]"}

{"description": "John Huston was eager for a lightweight lark, andThe List of Adrian Messengerwas just the project he needed. Philip MacDonald's upper-crust British murder mystery allowed Huston to work close to his Irish estate, including fox hunting and quail shooting well suited to Huston's lord-of-the-manor lifestyle. The mystery itself is clever enough: As a former MI-5 agent, George C. Scott is lured into the case when writer Adrian Messenger (John Merivale) gives him a list of 11 names to investigate, just before Messenger is mysteriously killed. Scott combs for clues to connect the names, and the film's promotional gimmick--big-name stars disguised under Bud Westmore's expert makeup--kicks into gear. Thus you get Burt Lancaster, Robert Mitchum, Tony Curtis, Kirk Douglas, and Frank Sinatra,barelyidentifiable under layers of latex, and the mystery never suffers from this playful distraction. Huston enjoyed making this film (he makes a cameo appearance, and his son Tony plays a supporting role), and that pleasure is passed along to the viewer.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000003NDA", "0792845404", "0792838009", "6301395395", "6304052952", "6301327853", "6300183998", "6304452829", "6302989787"], "also_viewed": ["B00007JZWI"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 246961}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 23.88, "brand": "", "asin": "6300184013", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51M01R873DL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The List of Adrian Messenger [VHS]"}
{"description": "\"Balance of Terror\" is a terrific drama that was essentially an outer-space version of a 1950s submarine movie. Writer Paul Schneider introduced both the Romulans and the concept of a \"neutral zone\" toTreklore, wrapped up in this story about the first encounter between a Federation and Romulan ship in 75 years. The resulting face-off between two vessels and their strong, noble captains--Kirk (William Shatner) and his Romulan counterpart (Mark Lenard, who later played Spock's Vulcan father, Sarek)--is directed and edited with suspense worthy of the classic sub movieThe Enemy Below.

{"description": "This minor 1955 work by Alfred Hitchcock, one of the lighter entries of his creative peak in the 1950s, is still imbued with the master's stock themes of shared guilt and romantic ambivalence. It is also hardly lacking in Hitchcockian cinematic inventiveness, such as a famous, often-imitated sequence in which some smooching between stars Cary Grant and Grace Kelly is intercut with a fireworks show that just happens to be going on outside in a Riviera setting. Grant plays a reformed cat burglar who is suspected of reviving his trade, though he knows someone else is using his old methods.

{"description": "Francis Ford Coppola took some of the deep background from the life of Mafia chief Vito Corleone--the patriarch of Mario Puzo's bestselling novelThe Godfather--and built around it a stunning sequel to his Oscar-winning, 1972 hit film. Robert De Niro plays Vito as a young Sicilian immigrant in turn-of-the-century New York City's Little Italy. Coppola weaves in and out of the story of Vito's transformation into a powerful crime figure, contrasting that evolution against efforts by son Michael Corleone to spread the family's business into pre-Castro Cuba. As memorable as the first film is,The Godfather IIis an amazingly intricate, symmetrical tragedy that touches upon several chapters of 20th-century history and makes a strong case that our destinies are written long before we're born. This was De Niro's first introduction to a lot of filmgoers, and he makes an enormous impression.

Add an all-star cast (including Sean Connery, Ingrid Bergman, Jacqueline Bisset, and Lauren Bacall, to name a few) and Agatha Christie's delicious plot and how can you go wrong? Particularly if you add in Albert Finney as Christie's delightfully persnickety sleuth, Hercule Poirot. Someone has knocked off nasty Richard Widmark on this train trip and, to Poirot's puzzlement, everyone seems to have a motive--just the setup for a terrific whodunit. Though it seems like an ensemble film, director Sidney Lumet gives each of his stars their own solo and each makes the most of it. Bergman went so far as to win an Oscar for her role.

{"description": "Back when the  firstStar Trekfeature was released in December 1979, theTrekfranchise was still relatively modest, consisting of the original TV series, an animated cartoon series from 1973-74, and a burgeoning fan network around the world. Series creator Gene Roddenberry had conceived a second TV series, but after the success ofStar Warsthe project was upgraded into this lavish feature film, which reunited the original series cast aboard a beautifully redesigned starship U.S.S.Enterprise. Under the direction of Robert Wise (best known forWest Side Story), the film proved to be a mixed blessing forTrekfans, who heatedly debated its merits; but it was, of course, a phenomenal hit. Capt. Kirk (William Shatner) leads his crew into the vast structures surrounding V'Ger, an all-powerful being that is cutting a destructive course through Starfleet space. With his new First Officer (Stephen Collins), the bald and beautiful Lieutenant Ilia (played by the late Persis Khambatta) and his returning veteran crew, Kirk must decipher the secret of V'Ger's true purpose and restore the safety of the galaxy. The story is rather overblown and derivative of plots from the original series, and avid Trekkies greeted the film's bland costumes with derisive laughter. But as a feast for the eyes, this is an adventure worthy of big-screen trekkin'. Douglas Trumbull's visual effects are astonishing, and Jerry Goldmith's score is regarded as one of the prolific composer's very best (with its main theme later used forStar Trek: The Next Generation). And, fortunately forStar Trekfans, the expanded 143-minute version (originally shown for the film's network TV premiere) is generally considered an improvement over the original theatrical release.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300214400", "6300213803", "6301543408", "6303202004", "630021463X", "6303909949", "B0000AUHOH", "B00008OSD3", "6301792734", "6305587159", "6300182304", "B0000A36J1", "B000065U6Q", "6304415346", "6305365121", "630336568X", "0671830880", "6300214060", "6304935811", "6302380588", "6303651488"], "bought_together": ["6300213803", "6300214400"], "also_viewed": ["6300213803", "6301543408", "B00DB97LRC", "6300214400", "630021463X", "B00BAXTYIA", "B00005JLRT", "6303202004", "B00DB97LCM", "B00000ILBK", "B002I9Z8DK", "B0000AUHOH", "B002I9Z8B2", "6304415346", "6304539258", "B000USUA8Y", "B002I9Z8CG", "B0095XPZBC", "B002I9Z8GW", "B001TH16DI", "B0083TUEHY", "B00HETWFVC", "630273486X", "B000HEWEJ4", "6303909949", "6300213668"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 278050}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.79, "brand": "", "asin": "6300216802", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4164CYFHC6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Star Trek - The Motion Picture [VHS]"}

{"description": "Thanks to an extraordinary, delicately balanced performance by Peter Sellers,Being Therereceived mixed reviews during its theatrical release in 1979, but has since become a celebrated comedy with a loyal following. It's one of the most unusual black comedies ever made, simply because it stretches a simple premise over 130 minutes of straight-faced, strangely compelling commentary on politics, media, and celebrity in media-savvy America. Adapted by Jerzy Kozinsky from his own novel, the movie's about a simple-minded, middle-aged gardener who, after a lifetime of seclusion and safety in a Washington, D.C. townhouse, gets his first exposure to reality beyond the walls of his sheltered existence. His only reference to the world is through his childlike addiction to television, and when a chance encounter brings him into the inner fold of a dying billionaire (Melvyn Douglas), he suddenly finds himself the toast of Washington's political elite. His simple phrases about gardening are misinterpreted as anything from economic predictions to sage political advice, and under the sharp direction of Hal Ashby, Sellers has the audacity to take this comedic conceit to its logical extreme.Being Thereis not for all tastes--especially not for those who don't appreciate comedic subtlety.

Donald Pleasence continues his mad-doctor bit from the earlier movies, Danielle Harris is the unfortunate relation, and Donald L. Shanks plays the monster. The film is an improvement on parts 2 and 4 (part 3 having nothing to do with Michael Myers), but it still amounts to routine slaughter with none of John Carpenter's stylistic brilliance from the original movie.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["630130053X", "6304288433", "6304136242", "B00023NRSM", "6300214605", "630428845X", "6300214656", "6305171769", "6300214192", "6302814391", "6300214311", "6301094352", "6300218058", "B00008DDU9", "6300214087", "6302717450", "6303396585", "B00000JQTR", "6303566391", "B00008EYBD", "6303579388", "6301589025", "6304169558"], "bought_together": ["6304288433"], "also_viewed": ["630130053X", "B00023NRSM", "630428845X", "6304136242", "6304288433", "6305171769", "B00005LC4Q", "0780627032", "B000FA57UI", "B000RIWAVW", "6301589025", "6302720419", "B00008DDU9", "6300214087", "B0000VCZMU", "B00000JQTO", "B0000039A6", "6302975832"]}, "price": 14.95, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 66825}, "asin": "6301562925", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/413P9DA22VL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Halloween 5 [VHS]"}
{"description": "Rebeccais an ageless, timeless adult movie about a woman who marries a widower but fears she lives in the shadow of her predecessor. This was Hitchcock's first American feature, and it garnered the Best Picture statue at the 1941 Academy Awards. In today's films, most twists and surprises are ridiculous or just gratuitous, so it's sobering to look back on this film where every revelation not only shocks, but makes organic sense with the story line. Laurence Olivier is dashing and weak, fierce and cowed. Joan Fontaine is strong yet submissive, defiant yet accommodating. There isn't a false moment or misstep, but the film must have killed the employment outlook of any women named Danvers for about 20 years. Brilliant stuff.--Keith Simanton", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302278929", "0783236352", "6301798503", "B002GSXKQA", "6300183580", "B000006914", "6301670159", "630266232X", "6302413435", "6300215741", "B0002HOERG", "6304039530", "0782006779", "0800113055", "0783221347", "6301800974", "6300183874", "6301586026", "6301327853", "B000UVV25Q", "630150528X", "6301628616", "B00000FZXC", "630236308X", "6302878535", "6300183912", "6304056915", "6302962048", "6300215644", "B000054OW2", "6301969316", "0783235593", "6301977688", "0800132009", "6304383169", "6300181340", "6301975987", "6303095186", "0792837649", "6301973410", "0783235623", "6301797957", "B0000048YO", "6301967496", "6300183513", "0783235607", "6300215717", "6303037380", "6300246868", "B000021Y6K", "B00003OSTO", "6302314631", "6304359721", "B00000JKNL", "6303364772", "6301978536", "0790743213", "6301586042", "6300988805", "6303560067", "6300246981", "6301964012", "0783235704", "B0002IXSVI", "0792837967", "6301969707", "0792845951", "6301628454", "0792840844", "0800100832", "0792837630", "6302363292", "1569942072", "6301973364", "0792840836", "6301578805", "B000059HH1", "6300215482", "6301978110", "B00004TX24", "6305012792", "B000007OY0", "6301968905", "6302041090", "6302732964", "B0000048PO", "B000006N70", "0790743531", "630196912X", "6303333079", "B000GX7MMA", "6301661826", "630197350X", "0792845870", "6300215938", "6302990130", "B000AQOER4", "6300183890", "6303402070"], "bought_together": ["6302278929"], "also_viewed": ["B00008DDRZ", "6303215734", "0783236352"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 271158}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.59, "brand": "KEY VIDEO", "asin": "6301670140", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5195aB9Y4pL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Rebecca [VHS]"}
{"description": "Alfred Hitchcock takes on Sigmund Freud in this thriller in which psychologist Ingrid Bergman tries to solve a murder by unlocking the clues hidden in the mind of amnesiac suspect Gregory Peck.

{"description": "Annie Hallis one of the truest, most bittersweet romances on film. In it, Allen plays a thinly disguised version of himself: Alvy Singer, a successful--if neurotic--television comedian living in Manhattan. Annie (the wholesomely luminous Dianne Keaton) is a Midwestern transplant who dabbles in photography and sings in small clubs. When the two meet, the sparks are immediate--if repressed. Alone in her apartment for the first time, Alvy and Annie navigate a minefield of self-conscious \"is-this-person-someone-I'd-want-to-get-involved-with?\" conversation. As they speak, subtitles flash their unspoken thoughts: the likes of \"I'm not smart enough for him\" and \"I sound like a jerk.\" Despite all their caution, they connect, and we're swept up in the flush of their new romance. Allen's antic sensibility shines here in a series of flashbacks to Alvy's childhood, growing up, quite literally, under a rumbling roller coaster. His boisterous Jewish family's dinner table shares a split screen with the WASP-y Hall's tight-lipped holiday table, one Alvy has joined for the first time. His position as outsider is uncontestable he looks down the table and sizes up Annie's \"Grammy Hall\" as \"a classic Jew-hater.\"The relationship arcs, as does Annie's growing desire for independence. It quickly becomes clear that the two are on separate tracks, as what was once endearing becomes annoying.Annie Hallembraces Allen's central themes--his love affair with New York (and hatred of Los Angeles), how impossible relationships are, and his fear of death. But their balance is just right, the chemistry between Allen's worry-wart Alvy and Keaton's gangly, loopy Annie is one of the screen's best pairings. It couldn't be more engaging.--Susan Benson", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792837207", "6301971922", "6302718910", "6300216365", "B000NNOYH4", "6301972147", "B00000GJ2B", "B0000040EL", "630146494X", "6301964365", "6302610702", "6304508557", "0792837096", "0783217528", "6301734734", "1558807780", "6301404440", "6304196806", "6300271870", "6302278929", "6304112254", "0790741067", "630339406X", "0800113055", "0800135954", "6300181367", "6300181340", "6304429274", "0783221347", "B00007E2F6", "6301797957", "6300182320", "6302305950"], "bought_together": ["6301971922"], "also_viewed": ["6301971922", "0792846052", "6303506291"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 222206}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.77, "brand": "", "asin": "6301963911", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5178RVKAYEL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Annie Hall [VHS]"}

{"description": "In the entire history of American movies,The Night of the Hunterstands out as the rarest and most exotic of specimens. It is, to say the least, a masterpiece--and not just because it was the only movie directed by flamboyant actor Charles Laughton or the only produced solo screenplay by the legendary critic James Agee (who also cowroteThe African Queen). The truth is, nobody has ever made anything approaching its phantasmagoric, overheated style in which German expressionism, religious hysteria, fairy-tale fantasy (of the Grimm-est variety), and stalker movie are brought together in a furious boil. Like a nightmarish premonition of stalker movies to come,Night of the Huntertells the suspenseful tale of a demented preacher (Robert Mitchum, in a performance that prefigures his memorable villain inCape Fear), who torments a boy and his little sister--even marries their mixed-up mother (Shelley Winters)--because he's certain the kids know where their late bank-robber father hid a stash of stolen money. So dramatic, primal, and unforgettable are its images--the preacher's shadow looming over the children in their bedroom, the magical boat ride down a river whose banks teem with fantastic wildlife, those tattoos of LOVE and HATE on the unholy man's knuckles, the golden locks of a drowned woman waving in the current along with the indigenous plant life in her watery grave--that they're still haunting audiences (and filmmakers) today.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["1558808590", "6301976126", "0784011451", "0792101448", "6304212151", "1558807780", "B000003NDA", "6301966430", "6301491920", "B00000F6MH", "6304366035", "6302226899", "0790743159", "6302413435", "6301586026", "0790741431", "6300208133", "6304429274", "0783217528", "6301797906", "6301798732", "0800100832", "B000GX7MMA", "B000054OW2", "6301977815", "B000056BRF", "B0000048YO", "B001E419N8", "630266232X", "6301978110", "6302968100", "6305237115", "6301564456", "0782008348", "0792115449", "6302353785", "6301964012", "630150528X"], "bought_together": ["1558808590"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 201324}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 18.88, "brand": "", "asin": "6301973232", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/717SP3TYNML._SY300_.gif", "title": "Night of the Hunter [VHS]"}

{"description": "The most successful public-television miniseries in American history, the 11-hourCivil Wardidn't just captivate a nation, reteaching to us our history in narrative terms; it actually also invented a new film language taken from its creator. When people describe documentaries using the \"Ken Burns approach,\" its style is understood: voice-over narrators reading letters and documents dramatically and stating the writer's name at their conclusion, fresh live footage of places juxtaposed with still images (photographs, paintings, maps, prints), anecdotal interviews, and romantic musical scores taken from the era he depicts.The Civil Waruses all of these devices to evoke atmosphere and resurrect an event that many knew only from stale history books. While Burns is a historian, a researcher, and a documentarian, he's above all a gifted storyteller, and it's his narrative powers that give this chronicle its beauty, overwhelming emotion, and devastating horror. Using the words of old letters, eloquently read by a variety of celebrities, the stories of historians like Shelby Foote and rare, stained photos, Burns allows us not only to relearn and finally understand our history, but also to feel and experience it.--Dave McCoy", "related": {"also_bought": ["6304209908", "6303218725", "B000R7NBMK", "B002BO2R4K", "630428957X", "0780618831", "B000BITUI4", "B003S1UNZU", "B0089VX0UO", "B004NJC0R0", "B00A2XTHYU", "B00003CXA6", "B004FGA2HQ", "B007VYEF04", "B009AMANBA", "B000050HEQ", "6303026109", "630272001X", "B00005N900", "0780620135", "6304383657"], "bought_together": ["6304209908"], "also_viewed": ["B000BITUFC", "B000R7NBMK", "6303218725", "6304209908", "0394749138", "B003S1UNZU", "B00JDCFQ6E", "0394562852", "B000ANVQ50", "0705425312", "B0002F6AH0", "0345348109", "B00003CXA6", "B0086IMN80", "6303026109", "B000T28PFQ", "B000BITUHU", "019516895X", "6303696627", "B000NTPDSW", "B00AQNOCZ0", "B00JAQJMJ0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 188197}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 85.0, "brand": "", "asin": "6301996135", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61MYX3J1YSL._SX300_.jpg", "title": "The Civil War - A Film by Ken Burns (Boxed Set) [VHS]"}

When the high-ranking Klingon and several officers are ruthlessly murdered, blame is placed on Kirk, whose subsequent investigation uncovers an assassination plot masterminded by the nefarious Klingon General Chang (Christopher Plummer) in an effort to disrupt a historic peace summit. As this political plot unfolds,Star Trek VItakes on a sharp-edged tone, with Kirk and Spock confronting their opposing views of diplomacy, and testing their bonds of loyalty when a Vulcan officer is revealed to be a traitor. With a dramatic depth befitting what was to be the final movie mission of the originalStar Trekcrew, this film took the veteran cast out in respectably high style.

{"description": "One of Humphrey Bogart's finest performances dominates this unusual 1950 film noir, which focuses less on the murder mystery at the center of its plot than on the investigation's devastating effect on a fragile romance. For Bogart, already a noir icon, the Andrew Solt script afforded an opportunity to explore a more complex and contradictory role--an antiheroic persona in line with the actor's most accomplished and absorbing triumphs throughout his career.For maverick director Nicholas Ray, the film posed the challenge of taking crime dramas beyond their usual formulas and into a more mature realm, as well as a chance to cast a jaundiced eye on the film industry itself. Its protagonist is Dixon Steele, a Hollywood screenwriter with an acerbic wit and a violent temper. Tasked with adapting a bestseller, he meets a hatcheck girl who's read the book, hoping to glean its highlights before writing the script. When she's found murdered, Steele becomes the prime suspect, and a tightening knot of suspicion forms around the writer.Steele's only, inconclusive witness is a pretty new neighbor, Laurel (Gloria Grahame), and the couple fall in love even as the pressure mounts. At first the new relationship is a tonic to the hard-boiled writer, who plunges into his script with a renewed vigor and discipline. But as the police continue to shadow him, Steele's own penchant for violence erupts against friends, strangers, and even Laurel herself, whose feelings are increasingly eclipsed by suspicion that her lover is a murderer, and fear that he'll harm her.Bogart conveys Steele's world-weariness and underlying vulnerability, and manages the delicate task of making both his romantic yearning and sudden, murderous rages equally convincing. Ultimately, that performance and Grahame's sympathetic work elevateIn a Lonely Placeinto what has been called \"an existential love story\" more than a crime drama.--Sam Sutherland", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000068EE", "6304056869", "6302413435", "B000BWIZRW", "6301978110", "0790743159", "6303364772", "B0007ZEO8C", "6302375827", "6302226899", "6304039522", "6304212151", "1558807780", "B001BZQMFA", "6302120446", "6301968948", "6304212135", "079074886X", "0783217528", "0790746387", "6300208249", "6302952581", "6301491920", "6301564456", "6302797675", "0790743531", "6301966430", "0783217390", "6302700949", "B00000493Q", "6300183912", "6302305942", "6301005740", "6301640667", "6302753198", "0783236352", "630292300X", "6302305950", "6302281849", "630150528X", "6303120474", "6303128890", "630196697X", "0792837096", "6302800897", "6302797519", "6304119038"], "bought_together": ["B000BWIZRW"]}, "price": 14.9, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 298317}, "asin": "6302801133", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510CFAB9KDL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "In a Lonely Place [VHS]"}

Hines is an American expatriate who gets involved with the situation.

And it's blood-curdling scary, too. Loosely based on the true crimes of Ed Gein (also a partial inspiration forPsycho), the original Jeffrey Dahmer,Texas Chainsaw Massacrefollows a group of teenagers who pick up a hitchhiker and wind up in a backwoods horror chamber where they're held captive, tortured, chopped up, and impaled on meat hooks by a demented cannibalistic family, including a character known as Leatherface who maniacally wields one helluva chainsaw. The movie's powerful sense of dread is heightened by its grainy, semi-documentary style--but it also has a wicked sense of humor (and not that camp, self-referential variety that became so tiresome in subsequent horror films of the '70s, '80s, and '90s).

{"description": "Consistently cited by critics worldwide as one of the greatest films ever made, Jean Renoir's bittersweet drama of life, love, class, and the social code of manners and behavior (\"the rules of the game\") is a savage critique undertaken with sensitivity and compassion. Renoir's catch-phrase through the film, \"Everyone has their reasons,\" develops a multilayered meaning by the conclusion. A young aviator (Roland Toutain) commits a serious social faux pas by alluding to an affair on national radio. To avert a scandal, the cultured Robert de la Chesnaye (Marcel Dalio), husband to the aviator's mistress, Christine (Nora Gregor), and a philanderer in his own right, invites all to a weekend hunting party in his country mansion. The complicated maze of marriages and mistresses (social register and servant class alike) is plotted like a bedroom farce, but the tone soon takes a darker cast. Renoir, who also takes the pivotal role as Andre's jovial pal and de la Chesnaye confidant Octave, deftly blends high comedy with cutting satire as he parallels the upstairs-downstairs affairs. The film builds to a comic pitch with the hilarious performance of Julien Carette as a rabbit poacher turned groundskeeper, but soon turns tragic in a devastating conclusion. The film was roundly condemned and banned in France upon its 1939 release, but years later (out of the shadow of WWII) the film was rediscovered for the masterpiece that it is.--Sean Axmaker", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 412283}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "title": "The Rules of the Game [VHS]", "related": {"also_bought": ["6304628188"]}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51JT64E0AAL._SY300_.jpg", "asin": "6302969301"}

But when the plan goes sour, the couple must flee to Mexico as fast as they can, with a variety of gun-wielding thugs on their trail. MacGraw was duly skewered at the time for her dubious acting ability, but the film still has a raw, unglamorous quality that lends a timeless spin to the familiar crooks-on-the-lam scenario.

Caroline (Judy Davis) and her husband, Lloyd (Kevin Spacey), have been at each other's throats for so long that they've developed domestic arguments into an art form, and the would-be kidnapper turns into a reluctant mediator, even after he's got the battling couple wound up in bungee cords. The situation grows even more complicated when the couple's smart-aleck son comes home from military school, but it's not the plot here that's a top priority. Instead it's the sheer pleasure of witnessing a three-way verbal jousting match, written with razor-sharp skill and delivered by actors who are perfect for their roles. The movie's got a dark edge, but it never gets too dark--you know that it's not going to slide into more seriously damaging territory, so you can sit back and enjoy the volleys of scathing insults and sarcasm the way you would a Don Rickles performance.

{"description": "The first installment of the late Polish director Krzysztof Kieslowski's trilogy on Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity, the three colors of the French flag. Blue is the most somber of the three, a movie dominated by feelings of grief. As the film begins, a car accident claims the life of a well-known composer. His wife, played by Juliette Binoche (Oscar winner forThe English Patient), does not so much put the pieces of her life back together as start an entirely new existence. She moves to Paris, where she dissolves into a wordless life virtually without other people. Kieslowski attaches an almost subconscious significance to the color blue, but primarily he focuses on Binoche's luminous face, and the way her subtle shifts in emotion flicker and disappear. The picture may be more enigmatic than the follow-upsWhiteandRed, but Binoche's quiet, heartbreaking presence becomes spellbinding; her performance won the best actress prize at the Venice Film Festival in 1993.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303326838", "6303486762", "6302508754"], "bought_together": ["6303326838", "6303486762"], "also_viewed": ["B005HK13T0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 467897}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6303160344", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518273SKGYL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Blue [VHS]"}
{"description": "The Crowset the standard for dark and violent comic-book movies (likeSpawnor director Alex Proyas's superior follow-up,Dark City), but it will forever be remembered as the film during which star Brandon Lee (son of martial arts legend Bruce Lee) was accidentally killed on the set by a loaded gun. The filmmakers were able to digitally sample what they'd captured of Lee's performance and piece together enough footage to make the movie releasable. Indeed, it is probably more fascinating for that post-production story than for the tale on the screen.The Crowis appropriately cloaked in ominous expressionistic shadows, oozing urban dread and occult menace from every dank concrete crack, but it really adds up to a simple and perfunctory tale of ritual revenge. Guided by a portentous crow (standing in for Poe's raven), Lee plays a deceased rock musician who returns from the grave to systematically torture and kill the outlandishly violent gang of hoodlums who murdered him and his fianc&eacute;e the year before. The film is worth watching for its compelling visuals and genuinely nightmarish, otherworldly ambience.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"bought_together": ["6304259093"], "also_viewed": ["6301792734", "B00000K3AN"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 359394}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.3, "brand": "", "asin": "6303187064", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71DFN9XXGPL._SY300_.gif", "title": "The Crow [VHS]"}

{"description": "Britain's Ealing Studios was at the top of its game when this classic comedy was released in 1951--one of the all-time best crime-caper comedies and a quintessential example of the witty and subtly subversive Ealing style. Alec Guinness stars as a mild-mannered transporter of gold bullion who has spent 20 years moving gold bars to banks in an armored truck. Then one day he simply decides to help himself to a million British pounds' worth of the gold, but to pull off the heist he enlists and old friend (Stanley Holloway), who sculpts and manufactures paperweights. Once the gold is hijacked, it's molded into souvenir miniatures of the Eiffel Tower and shipped off to Paris, right under the noses of British customs officials on alert for the missing gold. Panic ensues when six of the gold miniatures are mistakenly sold to a group of English schoolgirls, and just when the amateur thieves think they've finally pulled off their heist without a hitch ... well, let's just say this classic comedy has a few climactic tricks up its sleeve. Guinness is in peak form here, and director Charles Crichton (who scored a late-career hit withA Fish Called Wandaover a quarter-century later) keeps the action moving with impeccable British efficiency. Along withThe LadykillersandThe Man in the White Suit(both starring Guinness),The Lavender Hill Mobrepresents the golden age of British comedy, and it's still delightfully entertaining.--Jeff Shannon", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 458595}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.08, "brand": "", "asin": "6303209963", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51FB24FPW8L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Lavender Hill Mob [VHS]"}

Young Leo (Dominic Guard) observes the machinations of the adults in the household, all but two of whom conveniently ignore his presence. Marion Maudsley (Julie Christie) is promised in marriage to another aristocrat, but she is secretly in love with farm worker Ted Burgess (Alan Bates). They enlist Leo as their messenger, with tragic consequences for all concerned. The older Leo has never married, and as the story winds on, it becomes clear that his own infatuation with Marion irrevocably altered his life.

{"description": "A flashy, splashy summer-movie blockbuster that's fun and exciting without being mindless? That's the impossible mission accomplished by director Brian De Palma, star-coproducer Tom Cruise, and the crack team ofMission: Impossible. Based on the '60s TV show and an almost impenetrably complex (but nonetheless thrilling) original story by David Koepp (Jurassic Park) and Steven Zaillian (Schindler's List), with a screenplay by Koepp and Robert Towne (Chinatown,Shampoo),Mission: Impossiblebegins with veteran agent Jim Phelps (Jon Voight) and his expert crew embarking on a mission that goes horribly, horribly wrong. But nothing is what it seems. The nail-biting set piece--always a signature of director De Palma (Carrie,The Untouchables)--in which Cruise is lowered from the ceiling to retrieve information from a computer in a high-security vault--is an instant classic. But perhaps even more impressive, at least in retrospect, is a flashback sequence in which two characters attempt to reconstruct a series of events from multiple points of view. It's pretty daring and sophisticated stuff for a big-budget spy movie, but brains were always what put theMission: Impossibleteam ahead of the competition, anyway, no?--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B00FZM412Q", "B0044VB3CK", "B00016UX0K", "B005XUNG5I"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 370174}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.99, "brand": "", "asin": "630420065X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41CTTDNC5EL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Mission Impossible [VHS]"}
{"description": "This complex and rich film by John Sayles stars Chris Cooper as the contemporary sheriff of a Texas border town still under the sway of his late, legendary lawman father (Matthew McConaughey, seen in flashbacks). The discovery of a skeleton and crusted-over badge--buried some 40 years--initiates an investigation into an old crime no one wants to talk about but which will determine for Cooper's character, once and for all, various truths about his father's life. Sayles ingeniously sets this mystery against the backdrop of a developing, multicultural community losing its economic base while haggling over a history of racism. The overall effect is of a complicated American tragedy mitigated by the possibility of personal redemption.

{"description": "Romance at its most anti-romantic--that is the Billy Wilder stamp of genius, and this Best Picture Academy Award winner from 1960 is no exception. Set in a decidedly unsavory world of corporate climbing and philandering, the great filmmaker's trenchant, witty satire-melodrama takes the office politics of a corporation and plays them out in the apartment of lonely clerk C.C. Baxter (Jack Lemmon). By lending out his digs to the higher-ups for nightly extramarital flings with their secretaries, Baxter has managed to ascend the business ladder faster than even he imagined. The story turns even uglier, though, when Baxter's crush on the building's melancholy elevator operator (Shirley MacLaine) runs up against her long-standing affair with the big boss (a superbly smarmy Fred MacMurray). The situation comes to a head when she tries to commit suicide in Baxter's apartment. Not the happiest or cleanest of scenarios, and one that earned the famously caustic and cynically humored Wilder his share of outraged responses, but looking at it now, it is a funny, startlingly clear-eyed vision of urban emptiness and is unfailingly understanding of the crazy decisions our hearts sometimes make. Lemmon and MacLaine are ideally matched, and while everyone cites Wilder'sSome Like It Hotclosing line \"Nobody's perfect\" as his best, MacLaine's no-nonsense final words--\"Shut up and deal\"--are every bit as memorable. Wilder won three Oscars forThe Apartment, for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Screenplay (cowritten with longtime collaborator I.A.L. Diamond).--Robert Abele", "related": {"also_bought": ["1558807780", "6300216233", "6304039530", "0800113055", "6301607929", "6301973259", "6300183890", "6302226899", "6300183513", "6301973232", "6300268470", "6301670159", "6301798503", "6300215644", "630266232X", "6304039522", "0782008348", "0783236352", "B00000GJ2B", "6301670140", "0792108868", "630196912X", "0790743213", "B0000040EO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 362176}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.39, "brand": "", "asin": "6304308388", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51VQCSN36TL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Apartment [VHS]"}
{"description": "Goldie Hawn, Bette Midler, and Diane Keaton prove that revenge is a dish best served cold. Former college buddies, they reunite at the funeral of a dear friend who took a swan dive onto Fifth Avenue. All three discover they share the same unhappy history of husbands who dove into middle-age by dumping them for trophy wives. Forming a warring triumvirate, they decide to get even, and along the way remind themselves of long-forgotten capabilities. The action gets a little too \"wacky\" at times, but the gals are great. Portraying an aging actress, Hawn is sometimes a little too flamboyant, but there is much fun to be had in her flashiness, especially when she pokes fun at Tinseltown and her persona. Instead of her usual brashness, Midler stretches herself and shows us a woman who is not just unhappy, but also deeply sorrowful. Not that she isn't quick with a wisecrack, but her expressive face alone tells the story of her marriage. As the repressed and guilt-ridden spouse of a self- involved ad executive, Keaton finds her anger, and her voice, when her psychiatrist (Marcia Gay Harden) oversteps ethical boundaries. Watching Keaton grow from an ineffectual homemaker into a powerful businessperson reminds us that it has been far too long since she has done a comedy. Director Hugh Wilson smartly chose supporting players who each brought something unique to the film. However, he does not maintain the first hour's effervescent humor throughout the film, as the ending is weakened by a softening of the wives' resolve.--Rochelle O'Gorman", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 122332}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 0.92, "brand": "", "asin": "6304337183", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5179WY0WC0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The First Wives Club [VHS]"}
{"description": "Veronica Sawyer (Winona Ryder) has sacrificed everything in order to preserve her place in Westerburg High's most impenetrable social clique, the HEATHERS. As the only member of the group not named \"Heather\", Veronica has to work extra hard just to stay afloat. Going against her own morals and intelligence, Veronica succumbs to peer pressure on a daily basis, faking her delight in the humiliation of the school's less popular students. Bored of the frat parties and cow tipping so popular among her friends, Veronica's curiosity is peaked when a mysterious new guy named J.D. comes to town. The dark, brooding J.D. (Christian Slater at his best) observes Veronica among her pack in the lunchroom (where social hierarchy is most clearly displayed), concluding that Veronica is not a Heather at heart. When Veronica confides in J.D. that she hates her friends and wishes Heather #1 was dead, she never expects her words to have such dire consequences. Before she knows what's happening, J.D. is dragging Veronica on a killing spree staged as a teen suicide outbreak. But as Veronica soon learns, even death cannot stop the HEATHERS. As one Heather dies, her red scrunchee (the symbol of all power) gets passed on to the next Heather in line, and the clique that was the HEATHERS starts to feel like an inescapable social disease. How far will this war for popularity go? By far the darkest of teen comedies, HEATHERS invented a vocabulary of teen-speak all its own, asking questions like \"What's your damage?\" and introducing phrases like \"How very\". Director Michael Lehmann successfully blends the horror, comedy, and teen movie genres, creating a truly original film. Full of dark humor and deeply sardonic messages, HEATHERS takes a fresh look at the often-sugarcoated cinematic world of high school. Set in the 1980's, the film feels timeless in its relevance because of the daring nature of its themes.", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300183416", "B00005T33W", "0767819586", "B000065RCD"], "bought_together": ["6300183416"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 590283}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.94, "brand": "", "asin": "6304361009", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51BZA4724XL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Heathers [VHS]"}

Maggie Smith, Laurence Olivier, and Harry Hamlin (one of these things is not like the others...) star in a toga-ripper about a valiant hero, capricious immortals, and lots and lots of giant stop-action monsters. Perseus (Hamlin) is the favored son of the god Zeus (Olivier), but he has unwittingly ticked off the sea goddess Thetis (Smith). Just to make things worse, Perseus falls in love with the lovely Princess Andromeda, who used to be engaged to Thetis's son. Soon Perseus is off on one quest after another, with Zeus helping, Thetis hindering, and lots of innocent bystanders getting stabbed, drowned, and squished. Of course, the whole thing is just an excuse to show as much of Ray Harryhausen's stop-motion animation as possible, and good thing too. It's an old technique, but it still looks pretty darn cool, and it means the cast can just relax and do a bunch of reaction shots.

{"description": "For fans and newcomers, this boxed set holds a great collection, including all four great movies. The first in the series,Batman(1989), and arguably the best of the four movies, exudes the moodiness of the Dark Knight's character. Tim Burton's direction and Michael Keaton's rendition of Batman are an electrifying combo. Together they capture the sinister atmosphere of Gotham City and Batman's darkness. Jack Nicholson as the fiendish Joker and Kim Basinger as the resourceful and gorgeous Vicki Vale lend their charm. Three years later, in 1992, Burton and Keaton reunited forBatman Returns. This time our pointy-eared hero has to combat two villains: Danny DeVito as the disturbed and freaky Penguin and Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman. InBatman Forever(1995), Joel Schumacher gave his direction to the story with Val Kilmer under the cape. Kilmer keeps the moodiness but adds a little panache to his rendition. His archenemies this time are the Riddler (Jim Carrey) and Two-Face (Tommy Lee Jones). Luckily, he enlists the help of the Boy Wonder, Robin (Chris O'Donnell). The final movie in the series,Batman & Robin, is great eye candy, and this time Schumacher returns with George Clooney as the leading man and Chris O'Donnell again as Robin. Together Batman and Robin battle the icy Mr. Freeze (Arnold Schwarzenegger), with a little help from Batgirl (Alicia Silverstone). Delve into the Gotham City world with the Dark Knight to protect you, and don't forget to make lots of popcorn for this Batman marathon.--Samantha Allen Storey", "related": {"bought_together": ["B009JBWOU0"], "also_viewed": ["B00DUCXFUC", "B0039208JE", "B004LWZWGK", "B0039208QM", "B00A7AN2SK", "B001OST0LW", "B00F4FFO8E", "6304443064", "B000006FYP", "B001OST0M6", "B000AQOHNA", "B0016MOWOQ", "B001GZ6QEC", "B000059XXZ", "B008UZBHYU", "B001DJLD2G", "B000059XY5", "B000PC6A3E", "B008EXAJM4", "B00F9D00SU", "B00IO8VMB6", "B000P6XQ50", "B00IGVJGZK", "B000059Z8K", "B002GSXKP6", "B0007WFX62", "B003PIUIJ2", "B00H15LR3Q", "B0006L0LOS", "B001CC7PKS", "B0006A9FKA", "B00H14U45Y", "B00005LIRF", "B000IJ79VQ", "B00EAPMGIU", "B0054OGQOQ", "B00KE3B8HC", "B00B5AETMO", "0790749068", "B0060FXDCG", "B0057R5XRG", "B007D5E7C2", "B004ZJZQ1A", "B00H15PSWW", "B00IO9G4HW", "B00H15B6RS", "B000A9QKL4", "B00AEFXVCU", "B008MIMWOO", "B004L9GM3A", "B003KV3E3G", "B000U1ZV8K", "B002GSXKNI", "B000IJ79UW", "B00005JKCH", "B005PTYOTE", "B00177YA1K", "B000P0J0D8"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 402360}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.24, "brand": "", "asin": "6304613113", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51A6THBTQFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Batman Legacy (Four Film Giftset) [VHS]"}
{"description": "A little-known comedy gem, this never-more-timely sendup of quiz shows  and media promotions stars a delightfully aloof Ronald Colman as Beauregard Bottomley, the \"last scholar.\" Beauregard, out of work and living with his sister (Barbara Britton), hits on the idea of making a bundle on theMasquerade for Moneyradio show, produced by Milady Soap and hosted by a good-natured dolt (yes, that's Art Linkletter).Initially, Beauregard is in it for the loot, but this soon changes as the show's apoplectic boss, Burnbridge Waters (Vincent Price), mobilizes his staff--and in-house Mata Hari (Celeste Holm)--to finish off the seemingly unflappable contestant. Now front-page news, Beauregard means higher ratings and increased soap sales. Burnbridge realizes he has created a monster.Directed by Richard Whorf from a script by Hans Jacoby and Fred Brady, with music by Dimitri Tiomkin, this sophisticated, rapid-fire lark will remind some of vintage Preston Sturges (Sullivan's Travels). It  benefits immeasurably from the casting of Colman and Price as antagonists. Colman does a shrewd parody of his erudite charmers, and Price proves that he had the makings of a top-flight comedian well before he turned to ham-and-stakes horror. The title refers to Beauregard's alcoholic parrot and its choice of beverage.--Glenn Lovell", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303391915", "6302526094"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 388469}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.44, "brand": "", "asin": "6304681003", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51H1PQJFX8L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Champagne for Caesar [VHS]"}
{"description": "TakeThe Full Monty, add a sharper emotional edge, and replace the strutting strippers with a dignified British band. That's the essence ofBrassed Off, a bittersweet gem released in 1996, a year before its more popular (and Oscar-nominated) counterpart. In the Yorkshire town of Grimley, there has always been a coal mine, just as for the last 111 years there has been a brass band, and it seems that Danny (the wondrous Pete Postlethwaite) has been the director for every one of those years.  Tory economic policies, however, are closing coal mines around the country in favor of nuclear power, and Grimley appears to be next on the list.  Danny is unfazed by the threat, claiming, \"It's music that matters.\"  But some of the men are about to quit the band until the appearance of Gloria (Tara Fitzgerald at her most radiant), who dazzles the all-male group (including old flame Andy, played by Ewan McGregor) first with her beauty, then with her fl&uuml;gelhorn playing. The new member gives the band a boost as they continue to perform and compete, but closure remains very real, as director Mark Herman (Little Voice) accompanies the band's performances (played with gusto by theGrimethorpe Colliery Band) with scenes of angry labor-management confrontations and family strife.  In this context, some of the characters claim that the music is an irresponsible form of escapism.  It becomes clear, however, from a touching performance of \"Danny Boy\" to the stirring conclusion at Royal Albert Hall, that music is an expression of the human spirit, a bit of beauty and sanity in a harsh world. With defiance, the band can play \"Land of Hope and Glory,\" even when the land offers them neither.--David Horiuchi", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 437469}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 13.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6304707029", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/512PC4G84VL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Brassed Off [VHS]"}

{"description": "The key ingredient in this modern-day version of Charles Dickens's classic is director Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n, who made the glowing, estimableA Little Princess. If you saw that (and you should), understand thatExpectationshas those ingredients (great sense of time, place, and timing) but adds modern music and sex appeal; the latter personified by the long-legged Gwyneth Paltrow.Finnegan Bell (Ethan Hawke as an adult, Jeremy James Kissner at age 10) is the new version of Dickens's Pip. He's a child wise beyond his years, befriending an escaped convict (Robert De Niro) in the warm waters of Florida's Gulf Coast. Finn is also the plaything for Estella (Paltrow as an adult, Raquel Beaudene at age 10), the niece of the coast's richest and most eccentric lady, Ms. Dinsmoor (a fun and flamboyant Anne Bancroft). The prudish Estella likes Finn (catch the best first kiss scene in many a moon) but has been brought up to disdain men; she'll break hearts. As the object of Finn's desires, Estella unfortunately is a one-dimensional character, yet what a dimension! Clad in Donna Karan dresses and her long, sun-kissed hair, Paltrow is luminous. She and Hawke make a very sexy couple.Mitch Glazer's script does better by Finn. He's a blue-collar worker with a gift for drawing (artwork by Francesco Clemente). Following his Uncle Joe's (Chris Cooper) honest ways, Finn grows up as a fisherman, thoughts of Estella and art drifting away in the hard work. When a mysterious benefactor allows him to follow his dream, Finn finds himself in New York, preparing for a once-in-a-lifetime art exhibit--and in the arms of the engaged Estella.Filled with cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki's golden-drenched light, the film has an irresistible, wildly romantic look. Dinsmoor's place is certainly gothic, Estella and Finn's longing encounters glamorous. Cuar&oacute;n uses anMTV-friendly soundtrackwith a confident touch. Songs by Tori Amos and the band Pulp--along withPatrick Doyle's silky score--create passionate scenes. It all ends far too swiftly with a seemingly tacked-on ending (reflecting the book, as it happens) but the film is splendid storytelling.

{"description": "After the tight plotting and quirky intensity ofFargo, this casually amusing follow-up from the prolifically inventive Coen (Ethan and Joel) brothers seems like a bit of a lark, and the result was a box-office disappointment. The good news is,The Big Lebowskiis every bit a Coen movie, and its lazy plot is part of its laidback charm. After all, how many movies can claim as their hero a pot-bellied, pot-smoking loser named Jeff \"The Dude\" Lebowski (Jeff Bridges) who spends most of his time bowling and getting stoned? And where else could you find a hairnetted Latino bowler named Jesus (John Turturro) who sports dazzling purple footgear, or an erotic artist (Julianne Moore) whose creativity consists of covering her naked body in paint, flying through the air in a leather harness, and splatting herself against a giant canvas? Who else but the Coens would think of showing you a camera view from inside the holes of a bowling ball, or an elaborate Busby Berkely-styled musical dream sequence involving a Viking goddess and giant bowling pins? The plot--which finds Lebowski involved in a kidnapping scheme after he's mistaken for a rich guy with the same name--is almost beside the point. What counts here is a steady cascade of hilarious dialogue, great work from Coen regulars John Goodman and Steve Buscemi, and the kind of cinematic ingenuity that puts the Coens in a class all their own. Be sure to watch with snacks in hand, becauseThe Big Lebowskimight give you a giddy case of the munchies.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783228317", "0792845684", "B000056V73", "B000059HCI", "B0002G2B2W", "6305123616", "0792839846", "6304078145", "6302610702", "6304340648", "6301666569", "6302516986", "0790705141", "6303953425", "6300214753", "6305499365", "B00005ATQA", "630268644X", "6301578805", "6301627768", "6300184064", "0790734079", "6303454089", "6302941318", "6302054982", "1558807381"], "also_viewed": ["B0002G2B2W", "0783228317", "6304297912"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 212775}, "asin": "6304994540", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51WB1EBQW6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Big Lebowski [VHS]"}

{"description": "An economic crisis brings unemployed Nada (Roddy Piper) to L.A. in search of work.  What he finds instead is that the ruling elite of the world are aliens in disguise, their aim being to keep humans in a state of mindless consumerism.  His discovery comes when he dons a pair of special sunglasses made by a resistance group and sees for the first time reality unadorned.  Billboards, store signs, magazine covers--all bear subliminal messages to OBEY, to CONSUME, to have NO INDEPENDENT THOUGHT.  Money itself says THIS IS YOUR GOD. But worst of all, with these glasses you see which of us are really hideous, bug-eyed aliens.  The conceptual breakthrough is hilarious while keeping its roots in darker matters.  Although some fault the film for settling into its action plot, the ending has a great payoff. And the direction by John Carpenter is handled with superb workmanlike aplomb.

{"description": "Robert Bolt's successful play was not considered a hot commercial property by Columbia Pictures--a period piece about a moral issue without a star, without even a love story. Perhaps that's why Columbia left director Fred Zinnemann alone to makeA Man for All Seasons, as long as he stuck to a relatively small budget. The results took everyone by surprise, as the talky morality play became a box-office hit and collected the top Oscars for 1966. At the play's heart is the standoff between King Henry VIII (Robert Shaw, in young lion form) and Sir Thomas More (Paul Scofield, in an Oscar-winning performance). Henry wants More's official approval of divorce, but More's strict ethical and religious code will not let him waffle. More's rectitude is a source of exasperation to Cardinal Wolsey (Orson Welles in a cameo), who chides, \"If you could just see facts flat on without that horrible moral squint.\" Zinnemann's approach is all simplicity, and indeed the somewhat prosaic staging doesn't create a great deal of cinematic excitement. But the language is worth savoring, and the ethical politics are debated with all the calm and majesty of an absorbing chess game.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000056HEA", "B0057FGCRI", "B0000B1A58", "B001D5F2LI", "B0006GANX2", "B00008J2PG", "B00005AUKE", "B000BITV92", "B0006HBV3W", "B000BYA4HE", "B00AEFY6DI", "B00008LDO7", "076781326X", "B000XJD34I", "B00012FXJ0", "B00004TVUD", "0780021312", "0385496931", "B0018LX9RG", "B004FQX5A2", "B003WEAW04", "B002QXOYQK", "0679728228", "B00003CXBH", "B000FFJ83K", "B001NSLE5I", "B0000549B1", "B00005JKF6", "B000KX0IOA", "B000255LIY", "B00006ADD5", "B00005AUKB", "B000KJTGHO", "B00003CXBU", "B001GLX6TY", "B00004XPPC", "B00AEBB9FA", "B000WMFZMY", "B00005JN8Z", "B00011D1OK", "0898706254", "B00125WAXM", "B0001US8F8", "B0000633QW", "B00006RCO2", "6304907729", "B001D8W7EU", "B00GHU35HM", "B000E1MXTG", "B00AMSM9CW", "0767827775", "B00096S412", "B001GUYAZY", "B0051WTN50", "B00005MEOU", "6305257450", "B002HK9IDQ", "B000E1MXT6", "B000FL7C9G", "B0009S4IKQ", "B000MTEGSG", "B0045HCJQM", "B002VWNIBI", "B000E1ZBFY", "B00011D1OU", "B000LXWAI6", "B00005V1WY", "B00D3K357O", "B006FE83UE", "B0045HCJJY", "B0006GANY6", "B0002BO05S", "B00006RCO3", "B00GA8Z0B0", "B0010AN7Z4", "B00F6SHECS", "B001MVYUQ6", "0783240171", "B00BYCOIU6", "B000KGGJ0Y", "B004XYOQU4"], "bought_together": ["B000056HEA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000056HEA", "0679728228", "B0057FGCRI", "B000255LIY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 125062}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 19.37, "brand": "", "asin": "6305252564", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51-2r8McJlL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "A Man for All Seasons"}

{"description": "There was such a magic on the screen in 1995 when the people at Pixar came  up  with the first fully computer-animated film,Toy Story. Their second feature film,A Bug's Life, may miss the bull's-eye but Pixar's target is so lofty, it's hard to find the film anything less than  irresistible.Brighter and more colorful than the other animated insect movie of 1998  (Antz),A Bug's Lifeis the sweetly told story of Flik  (voiced by David Foley), an ant searching for better ways to be a bug. His  colony unfortunately revolves around feeding and fearing the  local grasshoppers (lead by Hopper, voiced with gleeful menace by Kevin  Spacey). When Flik accidentally destroys the seasonal food supply for the grasshoppers he decides to look for help (\"We need bigger bugs!\"). The ants, led by Princess Atta (Julia Louis-Dreyfus), are eager to dispose of the troublesome Flik. Yet he finds help--a hearty bunch of bug warriors--and brings them back to the colony. Unfortunately they are just traveling performers afraid of conflict.As withToy Story, the ensemble of creatures and voices is remarkable and often inspired. Highlights include wiseacre comedian Denis Leary as an un-ladylike ladybug, Joe Ranft as the German-accented caterpillar, David Hyde Pierce as a stick bug, and Michael McShane as a pair of unintelligible pillbugs. The scene-stealer is Atta's squeaky-voiced sister, baby Dot (Hayden Panettiere), who has a big sweet spot for Flik.More gentle and kid-friendly thanAntz,A Bug Life'sstill  has some good suspense and a wonderful demise of the villain. However,  the film--a giant worldwide hit--will be remembered for its most  creative touch: \"outtakes\" over the end credits &agrave; la many  live-action comedy films. These dozen or so scenes (both \"editions\" of  outtakes are contained here) are brilliant and deserve a special  place in film history right along with 1998's other most talked-about  sequence: the opening Normandy invasion inSaving Private Ryan.The video and DVD also contain Pixar's delightful Oscar-winning short,Geri's Game.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783231474", "B00BG0RSJ4", "B000VBJEEG", "B00AFEX83C", "B0030IIZ4M", "B0013FSL3E", "B00005JNS0", "B003H9M1Q2", "B000AAF1TU", "B00GDT5T9Y", "B00CTNYLQA", "B001ILFUD2", "B0000AOX0O", "B0012EM5D8", "B00005JN4W", "B0084IHVGG", "B00EV1YZ96", "B004HO6I4M", "B0006UEVT0", "B000YERP2S", "B0001I561E", "B0030IIYYS", "B00005TN8K", "B00CQRN3QI", "B00E9ZATJO", "B00004R99S", "B001HN6922", "B000MV9026", "B001KVZ6FW", "B004ZBACOE", "B00335EQ0E", "B000B8QG4A", "B00F522C7C", "B00004R99F", "B0084IHVUC", "B000056H26", "B003ZHVJGO", "B004G600A4", "B0039N74CW", "B002WJI2QQ", "B008YWY0HK", "B0034GK74G", "B00CUDD0C0", "B000AY74OG", "B00009YXAW", "B00AO686JC", "B0000VV4W2", "B00003CXB4", "B0042U94UQ", "B000H7JCK0", "B001ILFUDC", "B000GW8U1I", "B00003CXJ4", "B00CWM58WY", "B000AAF1U4", "B00005RDSQ", "B001ECQ75A", "B00005JNQS", "B00G5G7EXY", "B001OMU6UM", "B008JFUQ16", "B0002YLCOM", "B0007KTBIU", "B0084IHVN4", "B00CHVJODE", "B00003CXCQ", "B001DPHDCY", "B00275EHJG", "B0006JMLRK", "B0034JKZ86", "B002ZG97YM", "B000DWMYQ8", "B00005JMFH", "B0000VV4WW", "B00JK531ES", "B000GUJZ00", "B001NCDFTW", "B00003CXG7", "B005LAIISA", "B000035Z48", "B0013ND30M", "B00024I2Z4", "B000ION23A", "B000M343BC", "B001O5LVPI", "1558908404", "B000ROAK2W", "B000050MN3", "B005SDUV4E", "B000JBWWRO", "B00CMY3JBO", "B001HN6918", "B00E9ZATKI", "B00000JL8E", "B002JUFPEA", "B001GCUO7A", "B0006GANUK", "B00004R99O", "B00005JLR2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0783231474", "B00BG0RSJ4", "B00EV1YZ96", "B00AFEX83C"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 59935}, "asin": "6305327025", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DZRWWT2GL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "A Bug's Life"}
{"description": "Based on thenovelby  Max Evans and directed by Stephen Frears,The Hi-Lo  Countrycharted a long and circuitous route to the big screen, and the final result  proves that the material posed a major--and perhaps insurmountable--challenge for  screen adaptation. It's easy to see why this contemporary Western was once a  coveted project of director Sam Peckinpah; its codes of honor, male bonding, and  hardened morality would've played nicely into Peckinpah's artistic legacy. There are  clear echoes of Peckinpah in the screenplay by Walon Green (who wroteThe  Wild Bunch), and while the movie is blessed by Woody Harrelson's vivid performance as a reckless latter-day cowboy, Frears fails to maintain a compelling  tone and the rest of the cast nearly fades into the background.Billy Crudup (Without Limits) plays Harrelson's best pal, just returned to  New Mexico from service in World War&nbsp;II with hopes of starting a cattle ranch free  from the greedy clutches of a local rancher (Sam Elliott) who dominates the town of  Hi-Lo like a bootclad kingpin. Harrelson joins in the effort, but tensions rise when he  connects with the sultry seductress (Patricia Arquette) with whom Crudup has fallen  inexplicably in love. Harrelson has provoked others as well, and he seems primed for  a fall, butThe Hi-Lo Countryis a film out of balance. Memorable moments  are found in abundance, and the film's period detail is impeccable, but Crudup's  character is so underwritten and underplayed that his role as narrator and ostensible  hero has minimal dramatic impact. By the time fate deals its inevitable blow, it's too  late to care.

{"description": "\"I have a bad feeling about this,\" says the young Obi-Wan Kenobi  (played by Ewan McGregor) inStar Wars: Episode I, The Phantom  Menaceas he steps off a spaceship and into the most anticipated cinematic event... well, ever. He might as well be speaking for the  legions of fans of the original episodes in theStar Warssaga  who can't help but secretly ask themselves: Sure, this isStar  Wars, but is itmy Star Wars? The original elevated  moviegoers' expectations so high that it would have been impossible for  any subsequent film to meet them. And as with all theStar Warsmovies,The Phantom Menacefeatures inexplicable plot twists, a  fistful of loose threads, and some cheek-chewing dialogue. Han Solo's  swagger is sorely missed, as is the pervading menace of heavy-breathing  Darth Vader. There is still way too much quasi-mystical mumbo jumbo,  and some of what was fresh aboutStar Wars22 years earlier  feels formulaic. Yet there's much to admire. The special effects are  stupendous; three worlds are populated with a m&eacute;lange of creatures, flora, and horizons rendered in absolute  detail. The action and battle scenes are breathtaking in their  complexity. And one particular sequence of the film--the  adrenaline-infused pod race through the Tatooine desert--makes the chariot race inBen-Hurlook like a Sunday stroll through the park.Among the host of new characters, there are a few familiar walk-ons. We  witness the first meeting between R2-D2 and C-3PO, Jabba the Hutt looks  younger and slimmer (but not young and slim), and Yoda is as crabby as  ever. Natalie Portman's stately Queen Amidala sports hairdos that make  Princess Leia look dowdy and wields a mean laser. We never bond with  Jedi Knight Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson), and Obi-Wan's day is yet to come. Jar Jar Binks, a cross  between a Muppet, a frog, and a hippie, provides many of the movie's lighter moments, while Sith Lord Darth  Maul is a formidable force. Baby-faced Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd) looks too young  and innocent to command the powers of the Force or wield a lightsaber (much less transmute into the future Darth Vader), but his  boyish exuberance wins over skeptics.Near the end of the movie, Palpatine, the new leader of the Republic,  may be speaking for fans eagerly awaitingEpisode IIwhen he  pats young Anakin on the head and says, \"We will watch your career with  great interest.\" Indeed! --Tod Nelson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000633ZP", "6301792734", "B00005JLXH", "B00006HBUJ", "6304539258", "6304539274", "6301792769", "B000FQVX78", "6304539290", "0792158261", "B000FQJAJG", "6304117752", "0767729307", "B001GQSY5K", "6304178352", "B000FAGGWQ", "B00BBND56G", "B000FQJAIW", "B00005LL26", "B00003CXCT", "B00003CXI0", "B002I9Z8AS", "B00006AL1C", "B00CFWWDWE", "B000066HAS", "B000001ON6", "B000MUANT6", "6305587159"], "bought_together": ["B00005JLXH", "B00006HBUJ"], "also_viewed": ["B00006HBUJ", "B00005JLXH", "B00E9PMML2", "B0000633ZP", "6301792734", "B00BBND56G", "6304539258", "6301792769", "6304539274", "B00006JDUE", "0767729307", "B00E9PMMX0", "B000FQJAIW", "B000FQVX78", "B000FQJAJG", "B00000IQMT", "B000FAGGWQ", "B003ZSJ212", "0345434110", "6303148352", "6304089767", "0439834775", "6304117752", "B00BUZW14M", "6304500831", "0590010891", "0345341465", "6304434340", "B001GQSY5K", "155890641X", "B00005LL26", "6302961572", "0792151712", "B003W77SEO", "B000M4Y8JI", "0767825411", "B00003CXXI", "B00000IZ8A", "B00169IZN8", "6302787068", "B00006G8LB", "080010367X", "0800125762", "6302091632", "0792158261", "B000850IS6", "6300214826", "6303506291", "B00005V1Z8", "B000641D2Y", "0784011923", "B00008Y47S", "6300214060", "630382790X", "B00003CXI0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 79460}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.44, "brand": "Star Wars", "asin": "630575067X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41SJPKK4S4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Star Wars - Episode I, The Phantom Menace [VHS]"}

{"description": "Pixar genius reigns in this funny romantic comedy, which stars a robot who says absolutely nothing for a full 25 minutes yet somehow completely transfixes and endears himself to the audience within the first few minutes of the film. As the last robot left on earth, Wall-E (voiced by Ben Burtt) is one small robot--with a big, big heart--who holds the future of earth and mankind squarely in the palm of his metal hand. He's outlasted all the \"Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class\" robots that were assigned some 700 years ago to clean up the environmental mess that man made of earth while man vacationed aboard the luxury spaceship Axiom. Wall-E has dutifully gone about his job compacting trash, the extreme solitude broken only by his pet cockroach, but he's developed some oddly human habits and ideas. When the Axiom sends its regularly scheduled robotic EVE probe (Elissa Knight) to earth, Wall-E is instantly smitten and proceeds to try to impress EVE with his collection of human memorabilia. EVE's directive compels her to bring Wall-E's newly collected plant sprout to the captain of the Axiom and Wall-E follows in hot pursuit. Suddenly, the human world is turned upside down and the Captain (Jeff Garlin) joins forces with Wall-E and a cast of other misfit robots to lead the now lethargic people back home to earth. Wall-E is a great family film with the most impressive aspect being the depth of emotion conveyed by a simple robot--a machine typically considered devoid of emotion, but made so absolutely touching by the magic of Pixar animation. Also well-worth admiring are the sweeping views from space, the creative yet disturbing vision of what strange luxuries a future space vacation might offer, and the innovative use of trash in a future cityscape. Underneath the slapstick comedy and touching love story is a poignant message about the folly of human greed and its potential effects on earth and the entire human race.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000VBJEEG", "B001KVZ6FW", "B00007LVCM", "B00BG0RSJ4", "B00AFEX83C", "0736424229", "B00005JN4W", "B00005JNQS", "B0042U94UQ", "B00E9ZATJO", "B001OMU6UM", "B00005JNS0", "B0030IIZ4M", "B0034JKZ86", "B002ZG97YM", "B002WJI2QQ", "B004HO6I4M", "B008YWY0HK", "B0012EM5D8", "B0006UEVT0", "B009SZCC9U", "B004G600A4", "B00AAXFYPI", "B00F522C7C", "B008Z1LBU4", "B00CTNYLQA", "B003H9M1Q2", "B000AAF1TU", "B008JFUQ16", "B000ROAK2W", "B000AY74OG", "B00275EHJG", "B00CWM58WY", "B00009M9BK", "B00EV1YZ96", "B001DPHDCY", "B000MV9026", "B001O5LVPI", "0783231474", "B00CQRN3QI", "B00G5G7EXY", "B00I6JOD2S", "B001HN6922", "B00GDT5T9Y", "B0087F7VSY", "B001U2MQE0", "B0030IIYYS", "B00A83075M", "B00H4Z07Q6", "B005LAIH4A", "B000DWMYQ8", "B00CHVJODE", "B0000AOX0O", "B003UESJF6", "B00JK531ES", "B00HLTD2OE", "B0001I561E", "B00BGYO7HG", "B003ZHVJGO", "B001ILFUD2", "B0002YLCOM", "B0039N74CW", "B00004U9WQ", "B00937R6QC", "B00CUDD0C0", "B004EPZ034", "B00004R99S", "B00003CXB4", "B000065V42", "B00005RDSQ", "B004ZBACOE", "B001GCUO7A", "B00AO686JC", "B000AAF1U4", "B0006JMLRK", "B00005JMQZ", "B0043X1FOK", "B00C7JGDBW", "B001JRB17Y", "B001KVZ6G6", "B00005TN8K", "B00005JMFH", "B00E9ZATKI", "B001ILFUDC", "B000V1Y44G", "B00003CX8Y", "B0011U52E2", "B00EBBGLFC", "B000YERP2S", "B00009YXAW", "B00003CXCQ", "B002NZK5SW", "B000G75AZC", "B00CNW9ZI6", "B0084IHVGG", "B00947N6D8", "B004LWZW7Y"], "bought_together": ["B001KVZ6FW", "B000VBJEEG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004HO6I4M", "B001KVZ6FW", "B00I6JOD2S", "B00005JN4W"]}, "price": 17.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 319062}, "asin": "7883706837", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51u-jDIxUZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)"}

{"description": "This ambitious two-part adventure opensDeep Space Nine's fourth season with a major station shake-up, drafting Worf (Michael Dorn) fromStar Trek: The Next Generationand pitting the Federation against their allies, the Klingons. The warrior race has their own plan to protect the quadrant from the threat of the Dominion on the other side of the worm hole, which involves \"glorious battle\" that will break the precarious peace the Federation has maintained. In many ways, it redefines the show in a rougher mode and puts the station in a more volatile situation. The Federation's clash with the Klingons breaks a 20-year peace and forces Worf into the most difficult decision of his life.

{"description": "Yasujiro Ozu's economical style reaches its zenith in this deceptively simple 1953 story of an elderly couple in rural Japan who go to visit their married children in Tokyo. Chishu Ryo (Ozu's favorite performer) and Chieko Higashiyama star as the aging parents who find a cold welcome waiting for them from their two urbanized children, too busy with work and their own lives to pay them any attention. After a miserable trip to a noisy spa, the mother spends a pleasant night with the widow of their other son (who had died in the war) while the father drinks the evening away with old friends. But on their return trip, the mother falls ill and the family reunites one last time at her sickbed. Within this simple framework, Ozu creates a quiet but profound drama of the changing face of Japanese culture and the loss of traditional values in modern society. Described by critics as Japan's most \"Japanese\" director, Ozu's style by this time had become firmly established: the entire film is shot from an unmoving camera 36 inches from the floor (the point of view of an observer kneeling on a tatami mat), edited in a subtly off-center manner and paced at a placid tempo. Ozu's graceful style, understated direction, and rich evocation of character creates an elegantly realized world of dignity in the face of disappointment and loss.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302969425"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 552474}, "asin": "B000006D1S", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51QX2HMS9CL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Tokyo Story [VHS]"}

{"description": "When Steven Spielberg was an adolescent, his first home movie was a backyard war film. When he toured Europe withDuelin his 20s, he saw old men crumble in front of headstones at Omaha Beach. That image became the opening scene ofSaving Private Ryan, his film of a mission following the D-day invasion that many have called the most realistic--and maybe the best--war film ever. With 1998 production standards, Spielberg has been able to create a stunning, unparalleled view of war as hell. We are at Omaha Beach as troops are slaughtered by Germans yet overcome the almost insurmountable odds.A stalwart Tom Hanks plays Captain Miller, a soldier's soldier, who takes a small band of troops behind enemy lines to retrieve a private whose three brothers have recently been killed in action. It's a public relations move for the Army, but it has historical precedent dating back to the Civil War. Some critics of the film have labeled the central characters stereotypes. If that is so, this movie gives stereotypes a good name: Tom Sizemore as the deft sergeant, Edward Burns as the hotheaded Private Reiben, Barry Pepper as the religious sniper, Adam Goldberg as the lone Jew, Vin Diesel as the oversize Private Caparzo, Giovanni Ribisi as the soulful medic, and Jeremy Davies, who as a meek corporal gives the film its most memorable performance.The movie is as heavy and realistic as Spielberg's Oscar-winningSchindler's List, but it's more kinetic. Spielberg and his ace technicians (the film won five Oscars: editing (Michael Kahn), cinematography (Janusz Kaminski), sound, sound effects, and directing) deliver battle sequences that wash over the eyes and hit the gut. The violence is extreme but never gratuitous. The final battle, a dizzying display of gusto, empathy, and chaos, leads to a profound repose.Saving Private Ryantouches us deeper thanSchindlerbecause it succinctly links the past with how we should feel today. It's the film Spielberg was destined to make.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00006C7G9", "6303168507", "6303057225", "B00AEBBA36", "6302529441", "0800125762", "6304935811", "B00003CXTF", "B000EHSVS2", "0790734060", "6303257844", "6302415853", "B0007TKNGA", "6301247345", "6301662954", "0790734079", "6302610702", "6302909023", "630407185X", "0783221347", "079213690X", "0800132009", "0790701251", "6305363668", "6301115430", "0790752395", "6304071876", "6300268748"], "bought_together": ["B00006C7G9"], "also_viewed": ["0792151712", "6301792734", "0792837614", "B00003CXXO", "6303109950", "6304117752", "6303402348", "6303168507", "B00003CXTF", "B000RC7QVC", "0783221347", "078323662X", "630018627X", "6304151306", "0783230095", "6304233639", "B0000040EJ", "6303187064"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 269908}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 0.5, "brand": "", "asin": "B00000K3AM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4143F912CXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Saving Private Ryan [VHS]"}

{"description": "With a voracious trio of mako sharks wreaking havoc,Deep Blue  Seadares to up the ante onJaws, but director Renny Harlin trades the nuanced suspense of Spielberg's 1975 blockbuster for the trickery of the digital age. In other words, why build genuine terror when you can show ill-fated humans getting torn into bloody chunks? The aforementioned makos have been lab rats in an effort to harvest a miracle cure for Alzheimer's disease from the brains of sharks, but the research has an unfortunate side effect: the sharks get smarter, and they're determined to break out of Aquatica, the deep-sea complex where they've been penned.Model-actress Saffron Burrows plays the researcher; Thomas Jane pulls double-duty as shark expert and action hunk; Samuel&nbsp;L. Jackson's the corporate sponsor who chooses theworsttime for an Aquatica tour; and rapper LL&nbsp;Cool&nbsp;J is nicely cast as Aquatica's cook and comic  relief.

{"description": "\"Jesus' Son\" is the story of a young man's circuitous journey from drug dependency and petty crime to a life redeemed by his startling discovery of compassion. Set in the drug subculture of the 1970's, a young man in his twenties (Billy Crudup) careens through his days getting stoned, stealing, or scamming a quick buck. He is driven by an overwhelming desire to help those around him, to save them from their often sorry fates, but he repeatedly fails. Almost by a miracle, redemption does come to the young man. It sneaks up on him almost imperceptibly, through barely observed lessons learned from a colorful parade of characters who range from a crazed, pill-popping hospital orderly (Jack Black), a down-on-his-luck-divorcee (Denis Leary), to a half-paralyzed woman (Holly Hunter) who teaches him about love. Bit by bit, the young man stumbles towards sobriety and lands a job at an assisted living facility where he discovers the depths of his own compassion for others, and the grace that comes with it.", "related": {"also_bought": ["031242874X", "6305594333", "B0057ZAA6W", "B00006RCNV", "B0007CEXYK", "B00H0EN948", "B00005Q4CS", "B00003CWTI", "B000QXDCLA", "0374280509", "0767830555", "0060988827", "B00D3LA5WG", "B00005JM23", "B0000549B1", "B0012E2GFK", "B0007NMHOC", "B0042U9B3G", "B000I0QL7I", "B000286RP2", "B00049QQHI", "B00470MG06", "B00004U03T", "0374279128", "B00005AUJK", "B00004ZBVO", "B00007ELES", "B009AMALBM", "B00AEBB9CS", "B00008DP4C", "B000QQFKYE", "B009POCG0Y", "B0082A3HFK", "B00DX88ISM", "B000092T3X", "B001152TL6", "B0000BWVCR", "B00005N8A9", "B00005YU1O", "B002VWNIDG", "B00A1O0G5E", "B003Y5H4R0", "B00003CXZ4", "1250007658", "B004C45AZU", "B009AMAL4Y", "B0006GAOJA", "B00027JYLC", "0767827902", "B00AEFXJ86", "6304907729", "B00AEFYSWM", "B0008ENICU", "B00AEFXN9G", "B001R3YRG2", "B008220DGE", "B0076YFJPE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["031242874X", "B00049QQHI", "B00004U03T", "0312427743"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 324458}, "asin": "B00003CWS6", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51642HMG0SL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Jesus' Son"}

Tolkien's classicThe Lord of the Rings,  but this robust adaptation maintains reverent allegiance to Tolkien's creation,  instantly qualifying as one of the greatest fantasy films ever made. At 178  minutes, it's long enough to establish the myriad inhabitants of Middle-earth,  the legendary Rings of Power, and the fellowship of hobbits, elves, dwarves, and  humans--led by the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and the brave hobbit Frodo  (Elijah Wood)--who must battle terrifying forces of evil on their perilous  journey to destroy the One Ring in the land of Mordor. Superbly paced, the film  is both epic and intimate, offering astonishing special effects and production  design while emphasizing the emotional intensity of Frodo's adventure.

To  probe the secrets contained in Stargher's traumatized psyche, the FBI  recruits psychologist Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez), who has  mastered a new technology that allows her to enter the mind of another person. What she finds in Stargher's head is a  theater of the grotesque, which, as envisioned by first-time director  Tarsem Singh, is a smorgasbord of the surreal that borrows liberally  from the Brothers Quay, Czech animator Jan Svankmajer, Hieronymous  Bosch, Salvador Dali, and a surplus of other cannibalized sources.This provides one of the wildest, weirdest visual feasts ever committed  to film, andThe Cellearns a place among such movie mind-trips  as2001: A Space Odyssey,Altered States,What Dreams  May Come, andUn Chien Andalou.

{"description": "To callPearl Harbora throwback to old-time war movies is something of an understatement. Director Michael Bay's epic take on the bombing that brought the United States into World War II hijacks every war movie situation and clich&#xE9; (some affectionate, some stale) you've ever seen and gives them a shiny, glossy spin until the whole movie practically gleams. Planes glisten, water sparkles, trees beckon--and Bay's re-creation of the bombing itself, a 30-minute sequence that's tightly choreographed and amazingly photographed, sets the action movie bar up quite a few notches. And in updating the classic war film, Bay and screenwriter Randall Wallace (Braveheart) use that old plot standby, the love triangle--this time, it's between two pilots (Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett) and a nurse (Kate Beckinsale) who find themselves stationed at Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, during what they thought would be a nice, sunny tour of duty. Then, of course, history intervened.For the first 90 minutes of the movie, Affleck and Beckinsale find a nice, appealing chemistry that plays on his strengths as a movie star and hers as a serious actress--he gives her glamour, she gives him smarts. Their truncated romance--the beginning of which is told in flashback so we can get right to the point where he has to leave her to go to England--works, thanks to their charm. They're no Kate and Leo fromTitanic(a strategy the film strives hard toward), but they're pretty darn adorable in their own right. Hartnett, as the not entirely unwelcome third wheel, squints bravely but makes only a slight dent in the film. Everyone else inPearl Harbor--from Cuba Gooding Jr.'s brave navy seaman to Jon Voight's able impersonation of FDR--is pretty much a glorified walk-on, taking a backseat to the pyrotechnics and action sequences that keep the three-hour film in fairly constant motion.

{"description": "LikeSaving Private Ryan,Enemy at the Gatesopens with a  pivotal event of World War II--the German invasion of  Stalingrad--re-created in epic scale, as ill-trained Russian soldiers  face German attack or punitive execution if they flee from the enemy's  advance. Director Jean-Jacques Annaud captures this madness with urgent  authenticity, creating a massive context for a more intimate battle  waged amid the city's ruins. Embellished from its basis in fact, the  story shifts to an intense cat-and-mouse game between a Russian shepherd  raised to iconic fame and a German marksman whose skill is unmatched in  its lethal precision. Vassily Zaitzev (Jude Law) has been sniping Nazis  one bullet at a time, while the German Major Konig (Ed Harris) has been  assigned to kill Vassily and spare Hitler from further embarrassment.There's love in war as Vassily connects with a woman soldier (Rachel  Weisz), but she is also loved by Danilov (Joseph Fiennes), the Soviet  officer who promotes his friend Vassily as Russia's much-needed hero.  This romantic rivalry lends marginal interest to the central plot, but  it's not enough to make this a classic war film. Instead it's a taut,  well-made suspense thriller isolated within an epic battle, and although  Annaud and cowriter Alain Godard (drawing from William Craig's book and  David L. Robbins's novelThe War of the Rats) fail to connect  the parallel plots with any lasting impact, the production is never less  than impressive. Highly conventional but handled with intelligence and  superior craftsmanship, this is warfare as strategic entertainment,  without compromising warfare as a manmade hell on Earth.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEFXRRO", "B004U7MQWY", "B00AEBBA36", "B00001ZWUS", "B0007KIFGE", "B000065U1N", "B0015D20FE", "B001KZOUU0", "B00005PJ8T", "079284646X", "B001TUZG4K", "B00005JPKE", "B000095WW8", "B00003CXHJ", "B009XTF8NI", "0792839730", "B000M4RG42", "B00005JK8K", "B000P0J09C", "B00275EGWY", "B00003CXTG", "B003ASLJOU", "B003ELKNH2", "B000EHSVSC", "B004C45AZU", "B00AEFXKUI", "B00004XPPG", "0142000000", "B0007TKNGA", "B00HEPE6MM", "B00B0U2SFE", "B00005N5S3", "B00005PJ8S", "B00AEFYBA6", "B00006CXSS", "B00005ASGB", "B002ZG97RE", "B0007TKNLA", "0767802470", "B00IVLR9JA", "B00A34LX2M", "B00AEFY0F2", "0767817745", "B001LMAK9M", "B0000542CK", "B005LAIGYQ", "B000EHSVS2", "B00AEBB86U", "B00D3XMA9A", "B0000714C4", "B000XR9L50", "B000H1RFSM", "B005E2YL3Q", "B004TXFFI6", "6304698747", "0792838041", "B00008AOTR", "B000ELL1R6", "B002O3Z4Z2", "B000E5N63Y", "B000YBKO6U", "B00BY0EBK0", "6305558167", "B002O3Z50Q", "B00005PJ8K", "B006TTC5HC", "B0007TKNM4", "B00AEFY4IA", "6304765258", "B00AEBB86A", "B000DZIGDU", "B000FVQLRA", "B00AEFY5B6", "6305692688", "B002CPMB9O", "B00AMSLDTM", "B0000TANUI", "B00JA3RVG4", "B004SIP6QI", "B000O599YO", "B000MZHW40", "B00004XPPC", "0792838408", "B007HCI42A", "B0009RCPUC", "B00005B6JZ", "B0002YLCG0", "B00CZB9BE8", "B002O3Z510", "B00005OSJQ", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00005QAQI", "B000CNESN0", "B00008AOTO", "B005DKS1TE", "B00DL48BM6", "0792841662", "B0001NBMH6", "B0001FGC1U", "6304711891"], "bought_together": ["B00AEFXRRO", "B00AEBBA36"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00001ZWUS", "B00AEFXRRO", "B00AEBBA36", "B00HEPE6MM"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 22765}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.69, "brand": "Paramount Home Video", "asin": "B00003CXRA", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510oEAHvU8L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Enemy at the Gates"}

{"description": "Employing shock techniques and sound design in a relentless sensory assault,Requiem for a Dreamis about nothing less than the systematic destruction of hope. Based on the novel by Hubert Selby Jr., and adapted by Selby and director Darren Aronofsky, this is undoubtedly one of the most effective films ever made about the experience of drug addiction (both euphoric and nightmarish), and few would deny that Aronofsky, in following his breakthrough filmPi, has pushed the medium to a disturbing extreme, thrusting conventional narrative into a panic zone of traumatized psyches and bodies pushed to the furthest boundaries of chemical tolerance. It's too easy to call this a cautionary tale; it's a guided tour through hell, with Aronofsky as our bold and ruthless host.The film focuses on a quartet of doomed souls, but it's Ellen Burstyn--in a raw and bravely triumphant performance--who most desperately embodies the downward spiral of drug abuse. As lonely widow Sara Goldfarb, she invests all of her dreams in an absurd self-help TV game show, jolting her bloodstream with diet pills and coffee while her son Harry (Jared Leto) shoots heroin with his best friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) and slumming girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly). They're careening toward madness at varying speeds, and Aronofsky tracks this gloomy process by endlessly repeating the imagery of their deadly routines. Tormented by her dietary regime, Sara even imagines a carnivorous refrigerator in one of the film's most memorable scenes. And yet... does any of this have a point? Is Aronofsky telling us anything that any sane person doesn't already know?Requiem for a Dreamis a noteworthy film, but watching it twice would qualify as masochistic behavior.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0057ZAA6W", "B00005JM23", "6305594333", "B0007CEXYK", "B00005YUPD", "078401213X", "1560252480", "B00H3JHGBC", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00005JMJG", "B000I0QL7I", "B0009A40ES", "B00049QQHI", "B00005ATQB", "B000LAZDPG", "B00003CXZ4", "0792838068", "B0000AC8LR", "0783229526", "6305692572", "B0041KKYEM", "B000QGEB1M", "B00008977H", "B001AR60GK", "B000MGB6NM", "B0045HCJ08", "6305313687", "B001TOD92C", "B00009Y3QI", "B000NO39FG", "B000JBXXYK", "B00008975Z", "6305162026", "B00004UEDQ", "B000068MC2", "B00606OZUY", "B00003CWQR", "B000ERVK4Y", "B000A7DVR2", "B000A9QK6E", "B00EUENWIY", "B0016MJ6T2", "B00005JPAR", "B00008MTXI", "B004SIP95G", "B00AEFXESQ", "B000JMK6LW", "B00004Y6Q5", "B000FVQLQQ", "B000BYA5G4", "B00005JKJA", "B00005JKM2", "B0029LHW68", "B000BBOUUE", "B004FQX5B6", "B000PAAJZ6", "B000N3SU92", "B003YKYX9M", "B00AEBB8O2", "B00007AJF8", "B00A2H9QN8", "B0009WFEDC", "B00GUO2SKA", "B00013RC2K", "B000A7Q2DM", "B00003CXWV", "0792845803", "B001URA5Y8", "B00195I3O0", "B00006AFUR", "B000063JDE", "B00BMKGZVA", "B00AEBB8NI", "B00112S8RS", "B00177YA6U", "0767837398", "B000O76ZQC", "B0052ADP6Y", "B000J10F8C", "B000E6ESU8", "B00009OOFH", "B00005JLRE", "B0059GVBHG", "0767824954", "B00005JLWN", "B00E8G5GU6", "B000QXDCLA", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00004ZETA", "B00AEBB9CS", "B000021Y77", "B00011CZRE", "B002VECM4A", "B00003CXKS", "B006KH6CF4", "B000K7VHQE", "6305127654", "B00AFEXRME", "B004SIP7ZS", "B00020HB32"], "bought_together": ["B0057ZAA6W", "B00005JM23"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005JMJG", "B000MEYKD2", "B0057ZAA6W", "B00005JPAR"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 222264}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 15.36, "brand": "", "asin": "B00003CXP1", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/519CB9K0QML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut"}

{"description": "The latest adventures of the four women of the Knight Sabers are not a continuation, but an alternate version of their earlier escapades. In 2040, much of the labor in Tokyo is done by Boomers, robots initially manufactured by Genom to rebuild the city after a devastating earthquake. Unfortunately, Boomers sometimes go berserk and attack humans. Only the Knight Sabers, a cadre of female vigilante mercenaries who fight in high-heeled armor suits, can really tackle a rogue Boomer. Klutzy Linna Yamasaki comes to Tokyo hoping to join the Knight Sabers. A rampaging Boomer brings her into contact with the women of the squad: motorcycle-riding rock singer Priss Asagiri, AD Police officer Nene Romanova, and lingerie-boutique owner Sylia Stingray, who heads group. Linna eventually persuades them to give her a tryout. Despite the hard-hitting action scenes, the story begins very slowly, and the characters aren't terribly appealing. Priss is given to sullen silences, Nene sounds like a case of arrested development, and Linna inexplicably shifts between small-town innocent and defiant rebel. The men are all jerks and/or lechers.

{"description": "To get people into church, a young priest starts screening films every  other Tuesday. He's expectingThe Ten Commandments; instead, he gets10, with Bo Derek, which launches the lonely lads of this isolated Irish town into wild fantasies about sexy American women. One rambunctious night in the local pub, the boys decide to place an ad in theMiami Herald, asking for attractive young women to come to their town for a dance and possible marriage. Thus beginsAmerican Women(formerlyThe Closer You Get), an enjoyable comedy in the vein ofWaking Ned Devine. When the town's women learn of this hare-brained scheme, their reactions vary from bemusement to offense, and they set in motion a counter-scheme that changes the course of romance in the village. The cast is largely unknown (the most recognizable face is Ian Hart, who played John Lennon inBackbeat) but talented all around, investing their rural characters with heart and intelligence, without being afraid of poking a bit of fun at their foibles.American Womenis produced by the same people who producedThe Full Monty. While this movie treads similar territory (the sometimes conflicting desires of men and women), it has a little less comic punch and a little more Irish bittersweetness.--Bret Fetzer", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 543578}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.9, "brand": "", "asin": "B00004XMSJ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/517K8EWX2ZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "American Women [VHS]"}
{"description": "Monte Hellman'sCockfighter, adapted by cult noir writer Charles Willeford from his novel, is a strange bird indeed, an art film for an exploitation audience. Set in the game-fighting pits of the Deep South, it follows a season on the circuit with Frank Mansfield (Warren Oates), a veteran fighter whose hubris has cost him everything and who rebuilds his stable and his reputation while honoring a vow of silence. Costars Harry Dean Stanton and Laurie Bird previously appeared with Oates in Hellman's cult classicTwo-Lane Blacktop. There are also appearances by Millie Perkins, Steve Railsback, Richard B. Schull, and writer Willeford, who acquits himself nicely as a pit judge.Oates's portrayal of a determined, silent obsessive is almost minimalist yet beautifully expressive, accomplished with gestures, smiles, and nods. He's thoughtful and gentle yet dedicated to bloodsport, and his contradictions can be felt in the tension between the comic adventures and gritty stories of Willeford's script, with the meditative intensity of Hellman's often serene direction and cinematographer Nestor Almendros's lovely images of the Deep South's rural beauty.Cockfighterwas one of the few films produced by \"King of the B's\" Roger Corman that lost money, so he added a dream sequence full of nudity, created a trailer with action scenes nowhere to be found in the film, and rereleased the film under the titleBorn to Kill. Needless to say, Anchor Bay has returned to Hellman's original cut, which does contain footage of real and often savage cockfights. Animal lovers and squeamish viewers beware.The accompanying documentaryWarren Oates: Across the Borderis a genial if ultimately lightweight portrait of the actor by friends and fellow performers Ben Johnson, Stacy Keach, Peter Fonda, and hisCockfightercompatriots Harry Dean Stanton, Millie Perkins, and Monte Hellman.The DVD also features commentary by Hellman and production assistant Steven Gaydos, along with moderator Dennis Bartok.--Sean Axmaker", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 324171}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "title": "Cockfighter", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001O2SHJ4", "B0011ZXM12", "B000P0IZZC", "B000WC39FO", "B00005IA7Z", "B009R68H80", "B00J7N2VMQ", "B0009GX1CO", "1905124554", "B009YX8LG4", "1426960247", "B003XTOBU0", "B00ICWO1LC", "B00HT2L7VS", "B00H8J2KYU", "B0051J15ZE", "B0009H97H6", "B0012OX7D0", "B0009PVZD2", "B005IX3C4U", "B00067Z2BO", "B000S0GYRU", "B0004Z33E6", "B00F98FOI6", "B00006L92S", "0984589228", "B00I462XGG", "B00I462XLG", "B000063K2Q", "B009R68HFI", "B005KQVE1S", "B0048O2YWG", "B0009GX1CE", "B00JQYUZSS", "B004IB04NK", "B000MNOXZ8", "B000I8OOG0", "B000MM0LEQ", "B009RWRIMU", "B003L20IME", "B000MM0LF0", "B0074JOWBS", "B00A7OBJKY", "B0000648YY", "B0049M7BHA", "B00BJB2H14", "B00I3C1T34", "B000UJ48VS", "B0077T5SV8", "B000MM0LEG", "B00AZFECS6", "B00I3C1T1Q", "B008220DGE", "B000BGR1B4", "1905124678", "1568582102", "B00004Y6BH", "B00004W5VD", "B000UUX2VO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["1426960247", "0984589228", "1905124554", "B0011ZXM12"]}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51PFF8ZWH3L._SY300_.jpg", "asin": "B00004Y6BF"}
{"description": "If you've seenScreamandI Know What You Did Last Summer, then you know the entire plot ofScary Movie. That's okay, though, because this is a parody, and it helps to know the story in order to be able to get the jokes. No, the biggest surprise here is not the  story as much as the amount of full-frontal male nudity. Really, in addition to all the dick jokes (and the ass jokes and fart jokes), there's a couple of shots of the male member, one of which is erect and used as a weapon.Scary Moviesomehow ended up with an R rating, which in a sense is groundbreaking; perhaps our ratings board is loosening up after all.But is it funny? That's the most important question, and the answer to that is yes. In the vein ofAirplane!, with a dash of the Farrelly brothers,Scary Moviekeeps throwing jokes at you one after another. The law of averages says some of them have to hit, and enough of them do to keep the movie entertaining. Unlike the makers ofAirplane!, however, the Wayans brothers aren't making this movie out of a love of the genre, and unlike the Farrelly brothers, they don't make fun of retarded people with any sort of respect, so the humor throughout feels a lot uglier. Still, there are enough funny scenes inScary Movieto make the viewing experience worthwhile. Special credit must go to Lochlyn Munro as Greg, the over-the-top jock, who steals the movie up until the time he's gotta die.--Andy Spletzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004SIP9I8", "B004SIP9KQ", "B000FOQ1KY", "B00CAATSME", "B0009P42WI", "B001J710YI", "B004SIP9O2", "B00AZMFINM", "B004SIP9MY", "B0016MJ6J2", "B004SIP9P6", "B000F9RLL2", "B004LWZW2O", "B005CFBYW6", "B004P7CMZ0", "6305017115", "B005DCJ218", "B0000VCZMK", "B00177YA06", "0780631684", "B000055WFZ", "B00008K7AM", "B002IT5GDC", "B000O76ZOO", "B0002VYOVI", "B00AEFXQLQ", "B000RIWAVW", "B001NPD9LS", "B000069CF0", "B004SIP8ES", "B00441GYVA", "630529142X", "B000FA57UI", "B000AM4P9K", "B009XTF8KQ", "B002A5EBMQ", "0767811070", "B00AEFYPXY", "B00005LC4Q", "B002Q4VBPQ", "B000K405CY", "B000IFRT4W", "B0021L8UXA", "B003Q6D27S", "B000FC2HS6", "B00081912E", "B00003CY5Y", "0783235070", "B00AEFYYH6", "B00H0EN98E", "B004EPZ084", "B000FA57US", "B001P3SA9Y", "B0031U8OEK", "B00003CXPS", "B003PIUINS", "B000VKL6Z2", "B001L9EXUC", "B000WZEZGI", "B003UESJBU", "B005DEUEXQ", "B00003CXS7", "B00009PY4G", "B00BEIYGT8", "B002GHHHG0", "B006W4KVH0", "B000GBEWHK", "B00AJLHUA8", "B002ZG971U", "B000WGYMTC", "B00J5JSV3A", "B00005K3NR", "B000J4QW7W", "B001J9KJ4I", "B00003CXZ1", "B004EPZ06G", "B000V4UFZK", "B0006SSOHC", "B00001QGUM", "B000022TSW", "B00AEFYE08", "0767824954", "B000031WD9", "B00004STUL", "B00005JNZU", "B004SEUJO6", "B008R65XTC", "B00BEIYMAG", "B00AQJ8MLY", "B00AEFY37C", "B002ZG97TW", "B00005N7Z1", "B004P7CN7W", "B00003CY6D", "B00E8RKHWW", "B00BEIYMZ6", "B008G33PIM", "B000P0J09M", "B00006FDCD", "B00AEFYQWO"], "bought_together": ["B004SIP9I8", "B004SIP9KQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000FOQ1KY", "B004SIP9KQ", "B004SIP9I8", "B008MXMFVE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 150447}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.99, "brand": "Dimension", "asin": "B00004Z4WQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5123WET5P4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Scary Movie"}
{"description": "Perennial Oscar(r) nominee Judi Dench shakes off the dust of period pieces to play a sassy widow looking to recapture a little of the excitement of her youth: she was the star saxophone player of a World War II-era all-girl dance band. Yanking her instrument from mothballs, she starts blowing the old standards as a street musician, much to the horror of her cultured children (they prefer symphonies to swing classics), and then hatches a plan to track down her band mates for a gala reunion at her granddaughter's school dance. The script carries little suspense and few surprises, but the cast is a delight. Ian Holm costars as the band's womanizing drummer (in a dress and a platinum blonde wig), a rascally old rogue who seduced almost every member during their brief wartime run and married half of them in the intervening years. Olympia Dukakis (Moonstruck) is their trombonist, a hard-drinking American widow living it up in a Scottish castle; jazz great Cleo Laine is a trumpeter turned torch singer; and Leslie Caron cameos as their brassy bass player. Joan Sims (a fixture of theCarry Onmovies), Billie Whitelaw (Quills), and June Whitfield (the mother onAbsolutely Fabulous) are among the great British character actors who join the fun. The old broads bring sass to the sentimentality in this fluffy, feel-good, made-for-cable comedy, insisting there is not only life after 60, but that it swings sweetly if only you let it.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000ETRCN0", "B000BITVAG", "630560097X", "B0002DRDY6", "B00AZMFO6I", "B004XYOQU4", "B005S9EJ14", "B000LPS34E", "B0073U2EWM", "B002TZS58I", "B0000CE684", "B000E8JNQU", "B005SYZYYK", "B000085OY1", "B007A2O3FO", "B004SIP7D0", "B00GSBMNOQ", "B00003CX8N", "B0080QOL10", "B005CFBZX4", "B0001I55M4", "B00BCXVYOK", "B009T6CXG0", "B0000640VK", "B004ALIG2O", "B000F3UAFC", "B00GPWEPZ8", "B00DL48BM6", "B00KB01NQO", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B000CDSS22", "B00080ZG4C", "B00G15MDI0", "B0001US78G", "B0080QOL1A", "B005CFC0HE", "B00L16P1I8", "B00H7LJ2UO", "B00HHYF548", "B002F3C6NO", "B007ISJS1O", "B0080QOKYS", "6305692696", "B000F4RHC0", "B008B9JTFO", "B00009IB1D", "B00JJRLFTU", "B000NIVJFY", "B00HUAGYF8", "B0013K2ZGI", "B00JFH8GZA", "B000C8STWQ", "B00003CXMY", "B00GOC756A", "B00GWXI20E", "B007701RFS", "B00F1BFRA6", "B004TPJMZQ", "B000A8AXXG", "B00IBKXP8A", "B00JJRLG7G", "B00EV4EUT8", "B00K6DQGC2", "B00HUAH14Q", "B00005JKNF", "B004JMSIQS", "B004LVRQ5G", "B00FPPQYXM", "B00003CXC9", "B005JZBOV0", "B00H4ZEFTQ", "B002XDR5NC", "1250002141", "B002XTBECY", "B00FZ4KR4U", "B00GHH9I62", "B00140PK6O", "B004U7MQZ6", "B0009S2SOY", "B00BCXW106", "B0018M6J90", "B00441GYRO", "B00D49YEHO", "B009DS6YGO", "B00AZMFO9U", "0312659067", "B00GMV8M2Y", "B00G4Q3KOC", "B00G7QPUII", "B00005JOA0", "B00HGE90Z4", "B00H9HZITU", "B00E3UN66I", "B0050N0US4", "B00GWXI1F0", "B00H9LHVHI", "B002I5GNZQ", "B00G7QPXUI", "B0013NAMLK"], "bought_together": ["B000BITVAG", "630560097X"], "buy_after_viewing": ["630560097X", "B005S9EJ14", "B000BITVAG", "B00AZMFO6I"]}, "price": 30.0, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 82376}, "asin": "B000053VAO", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51VQ3XRA6QL._SX300_.jpg", "title": "The Last of the Blonde Bombshells"}

Fast-talking Richard Dreyfuss is the nominal leader of the quartet of retired Jersey wiseguys, and thick-headed softy Dan Hedaya, silver-haired lady's man Seymour Cassel, and Burt Reynolds, an enforcer with a pacemaker, round out the group. When their Florida apartment house threatens to go condo with young, upscale tenants, they flex their creaky muscles and scare off investors with a devious bit of mob theatrics. Their success spirals out of control, and soon they're up to their toupees in blackmail, murder for hire, a homicide investigation by a cop who just may be Dreyfuss's character's long-lost daughter (Carrie-Anne Moss), and a mob war with a Hispanic drug lord.

{"description": "With its modest special effects, lean plot, and small cast of lesser  stars, this 1951 thriller remains a sturdy blueprint for fusing horror and  science fiction. The formula has been employed countless times since, fleshed  out with more extensive and elaborate production values, and manned by higher profiled marquee names, but the results have yet to improve onThe Thing from Another World, Howard Hawks's lone foray into sci-fi.The story begins as military airmen are dispatched to a remote Arctic research station where scientists have detected the crash of a spacecraft.  An effort to retrieve the saucer-shaped vehicle fails, but the team returns to the station with the frozen body of its sole occupant. When the extraterrestrial pilot is accidentally thawed, the crew, headed by a tough-talking pilot (Kenneth Tobey), grapples with a massive, chlorophyll-based humanoid (James Arness) thirsty for blood and in no mood for galactic diplomacy.Hawks takes only a production credit for this low-budget exercise, but his filmmaking style transcends Christian Nyby's nominal direction: rapid-fire, overlapping dialogue, an ensemble of comrades whose professionalism is tempered by wisecracks, and unsentimental female characters (embodied by feisty romantic interest Margaret Sheridan) recall Hawks's signature works, while propelling the plot over any potential gaps in credibility. It's hardly surprising, then, thatThe Thing from Another Worldremains among the most influential science fiction movies ever shot, or that it remains exciting entertainment a half century later.--Sam Sutherland", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JKFR", "0783240953", "6303257801", "6302120101", "B00007JME0", "B000AQKU72", "B000DZC5PA", "B007Y1NNAW", "6300183084", "B00005R1O7", "6302890721", "0790731975", "6304507348", "0792835077", "6301977742", "0783236352", "6301977149", "6301968948", "6300208508", "B0000068SI", "B000JTATHG", "6301661729", "6304429274", "6300247589", "0790752395", "6302526191", "B000HDNPM0", "6303398375", "630442972X", "6303953492", "6302763835", "6301976401", "0783103107", "6300215539", "6302843200", "630168740X", "6300213900", "6300216500", "6300181278", "6302841798", "6300213838", "6302182530", "6300269477", "6300185281", "6300247597", "6301562178", "0790736055", "6300182533", "6300181340", "B00004R67T", "630258793X", "6303082815"], "bought_together": ["B00005JKFR", "B007Y1NNAW"], "also_viewed": ["B0067QPVJ6", "6300182878", "B000FOPPEC", "6303506291", "B00005JKFR", "6300247171", "B0045HCJKS", "B00AEBB8VK", "B00IYJFB2G"]}, "price": 5.0, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 345640}, "asin": "B00005JG70", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5120YBRYW7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Thing From Another World [VHS]"}
{"description": "Director Frank Darabont created this Frank Capra-inspired drama based on a screenplay by his friend and one-time schoolmate Michael Sloane. Jim Carrey stars as Pete Appleton, a screenwriter in the Hollywood of the 1950s. Pete's on top of the world with his first motion picture \"Sand Pirates of the Sahara\" just released to theaters and his romance with a beautiful starlet (Amanda Detmer) heating up. However, his triumph turns to dismay when he's called before the commie-hunting House Un-American Activities Committee and advised by a studio lawyer and his agent to play ball with the witch hunters. Depressed by the film industry's weak-kneed reaction to the hearings, Pete gets drunk and drives his car north along the California coast, where he crashes from a bridge and wakes up on shore the next morning suffering from amnesia. Wandering into the nearby small town of Lawson, Pete is mistaken for Luke Trimble, a lost hero of World War II who, like most of the area's young men, never returned from the war a decade earlier. \"Luke\" has soon reunited with both his father (Martin Landau) and his one-time girlfriend (Laurie Holden), and finds that his reappearance has given the citizens of Lawson an emotional boost that's sorely needed. When he refurbishes and reopens his family's decrepit movie theater, the Majestic, Luke revitalizes Lawson just as his memory of his true identity begins to reassert itself. Sloane's original script for The Majestic (2001) was entitled The Bijou.", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 298103}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.75, "brand": "", "asin": "B00005JKNB", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GZ710HSNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Majestic [VHS]"}

{"description": "WithThe Return of the King, the greatest fantasy epic in film history draws to a grand and glorious conclusion. Director Peter Jackson's awe-inspiring adaptation of the Tolkien classicThe Lord of the Ringscould never fully satisfy those who remain exclusively loyal to Tolkien's expansive literature, but as a showcase for physical and technical craftsmanship it is unsurpassed in pure scale and ambition, setting milestone after cinematic milestone as the brave yet charmingly innocent Hobbit Frodo (Elijah Wood) continues his mission to Mordor, where he is destined to destroy the soul-corrupting One Ring of Power in the molten lava of Mount Doom. While the heir to the kingdom of Men, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), endures the massive battle at Minas Tirith with the allegiance of the elf Legolas (Orlando Bloom), dwarf Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) and the great wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen), Frodo and stalwart companion Samwise Gamgee (Sean Astin) must survive the schizoid deceptions of Gollum, who remains utterly convincing as a hybrid of performance (by Andy Serkis) and subtly nuanced computer animation.Jackson and cowriters Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens have much ground to cover; that they do so with intense pacing and epic sweep is impressive enough, but by investing greater depth and consequence in the actions of fellow Hobbits Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd), they ensure thatReturn of the Kingmaintains the trilogy's emphasis on intimate fellowship. While several major characters appear only briefly, and one (Christopher Lee's evil wizard, Saruman) relegated entirely to the extended version on DVD, Jackson is to be commended for his editorial acumen; like Legolas the archer, his aim as a filmmaker is consistently true, and he remains faithful to Tolkien's overall vision. IfReturnsuffers from too many endings, as some critic suggested, it's only because the epic's conclusion is so loyally inclusive of the actors--most notably Astin--who gave it such strength to begin with. By ending theLOTRtrilogy with noble integrity and faith in the power of imaginative storytelling,The Return of the King, like its predecessors, will stand as an adventure for the ages.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JKZV", "B00003CWT6", "B00BEZTMFY", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B002ZG980U", "B002PMV9FG", "B008UZA8FY", "B001NGML48", "B00005JM5E", "B001GZ6QC4", "B005COPWZW", "B008M4C1EO", "B00HFFE8HE", "039548930X", "B000W7F5SS", "B000I0RQVI", "B002VWNIDG", "B000E6EK2Y", "B001BYMX4A", "B004M1A21K", "B007K3JFUQ", "B001DHXT20", "B001UV4XHY", "0345325818", "B003Y5H54W", "B00005JNJV", "B00E5I2M6I", "B000A3XY5A", "B004LWZWGA", "B000U7WV1Y", "B005LXQLRW", "B001OQCV6A", "B000E8M0VA", "B004SIP8ZM", "B000EHRVMY", "0618640150", "B003ZK99NQ", "B0013FDM7E", "B00005JPH2", "B000UNYK4E", "B009JBWOU0", "B00003CX5P", "B00008G8M5", "B00GKOJ98E", "B004LWZW42", "B000H30B2C", "B000P0J0C4", "B00CZDLGDU", "B000M341QE", "B00008G8M4", "B000FKO5QK", "B00HWWUQYY", "B007SPPANM", "B008JFUO72", "B001DJLD1M", "0345538374", "B00AEFY5B6", "B00005JKCH", "B004SIP9U6", "B000YGGNMO", "B00E5I2M9K", "0618126988", "B005OCFGTO", "B00E8S2JZ4", "6305313687", "B004AKCME8", "B0002KVUKM", "B000AARKOO", "B0006GAO5Y", "B000K7VHQ4", "B002ZG997C", "B00AHTYI5M", "B008JFUS0U", "B0042MEQVG", "B00275EGWY", "B00E9PMML2", "B008UZDXEW", "B004SIP7F8", "B00116GEJS", "B00003CXI1", "B003ZKBELG", "B003Y5H5EW", "B000V4UFZK", "B0007PLLBU", "B001DTPZNY", "B002O3Z50Q", "B001GCUO1Q", "B000LP6KNU", "B005G4TJUC", "B00AW0KHTM", "B002ZG97YM", "054792819X", "B00AEFXZJE", "B0000YEEGM", "B002IPFWTE", "B001ECQ75A", "B000065U1N", "B0051MKNV8", "B000W796OM", "B00J49R1BY"], "bought_together": ["B00005JKZV", "B00003CWT6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00HFFE8HE", "B00003CWT6", "B00005JKZV", "B00BEZTMFY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 1589}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.49, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00005JKZY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HS7iSFv5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)"}

{"description": "A Beautiful Mindmanages to twist enough pathos out of John Nash's incredible life story to redeem an at-times goofy portrayal of schizophrenia. Russell Crowe tackles the role with characteristic fervor, playing the Nobel prize-winning mathematician from his days at Princeton, where he developed a groundbreaking economic theory, to his meteoric rise to the cover ofForbesmagazine and an MIT professorship, and on through to his eventual dismissal due to schizophrenic delusions. Of course, it is the delusions that fascinate director Ron Howard and, predictably, go astray. Nash's other world, populated as it is by a maniacal Department of Defense agent (Ed Harris), an imagined college roommate who seems straight out ofDead Poets Society, and an orphaned girl, is so fluid and scriptlike as to make the viewer wonder if schizophrenia is really as slick as depicted. Crowe's physical intensity drags us along as he works admirably to carry the film on his considerable shoulders. No doubt the story of Nash's amazing will to recover his life without the aid of medication is a worthy one, his eventual triumph heartening. Unfortunately, Howard's flashy style is unable to convey much of it.--Fionn Meade", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004SIP7ZS", "B0043X1FL8", "B004FQX5B6", "B00AEFZ63M", "B0000YEEGM", "B00003CWQR", "B000ARTN3I", "B000EHQU0S", "6305144168", "0767811100", "B000066HAS", "B000P0J0EW", "B00AEFYSWM", "B0002B15ZG", "1451628420", "B00000IQV7", "B000021Y7L", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00AEFY5B6", "B003ASLJQI", "B000XJD3JI", "B004SUDQ22", "B004U7MR1Y", "B00A81MV3U", "B0043X1FM2", "B00B0U2SFE", "B002NZK5UK", "B000N6U0E2", "B003B3NGS6", "B00AEBB9F0", "B00AEBB8NI", "B00004RJ73", "B00003CWRX", "B00125WAWS", "B00005JLSB", "6305428352", "B00008EY60", "0800141806", "B00001ZWUS", "B00011CZRE", "B00AEBB9CS", "6304712936", "0780619587", "B00007GZR5", "B000YAF4MA", "B000KX0IOA", "B004SIP8W0", "B00080ZG10", "B00B9LNPA6", "0783225733", "B003U0AHBO", "B00004BZIY", "B00005JND5", "B000E33VWW", "B003NF97NK", "B0038M2AZA", "B002CPMB9O", "B000P0J0EM", "B000A3XY5A", "B00AFEXRME", "B00005Q4CS", "B000LC55F2", "B00AEBB9SM", "B0006FYOTC", "B000056VP4", "B002WNU0QW", "B000RTB0R6", "0684819066", "B00003CXZ4", "B00AEFY17E", "B000EGDB10", "B002VECM6S", "B002ZG980U", "B001P9KR8U", "B001N44BVQ", "B000LP6KNU", "B0007DFJ0G", "B0002V7ON8", "B0018CWW5K", "B00JPQ1INI", "B0030Y12FU", "B003ELKNH2", "B000K2UGZM", "B00121QGPY", "B0001CNRAM", "B00003CXFV", "0783223609", "B007N31YH0", "B002HK9IDQ", "B005BYBZEK", "B000JJ5F8O", "B00AEFYXJ0", "B003UESJHO", "B00A7MSQSO", "B004SIP9U6", "B00005JL78", "B00012QLB4", "B003UESJH4", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B000K7VHQE"], "bought_together": ["B004SIP7ZS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00C7MW5EI", "B004SIP7ZS", "B001F34HRS", "B00001ZWUS"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 3605}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.99, "brand": "UNI DIST CORP.

When her parents undergo a mysterious transformation, she must call upon the courage she never knew she had to free herself and return her family to the outside world.

{"description": "It's not that the folks at Pixar are geniuses when it comes to DVDs... well, come to think of it, their fifth DVD set shows these folks are wizards. It's not just that the two discs are packed with watchable extras that hardly reiterate the same information; it's how they are handled--funny, inventive, with a light touch--unlike many PR-driven discs. A good place to start is the filmmakers' jolly commentary track, which branches off into 31 minutes of behind-the-scene stuff, deleted scenes, and curious anecdotes (they can also be watched separately). Pixar's first making-of documentary is a most concise and interesting 25-minute examination that also sheds light on how the company works. With a digital-to-digital transfer, the film looks great and is available in widescreen or reformatted to full screen. The \"Family Fun\" disc includes another Pixar made-for-the-DVD gem, the 7-minute \"Exploring the Reef\" with Jean-Michel Cousteau (Jacques's son) being upstaged by Dori and Marlin; it's a hoot and teaches a fact or two you will remember about reefs. Both discs feature lovely menus that can be turned into virtual aquariums for your TV (by removing the text) featuring the knockout colors of the film's settings. Watch long enough for some shenanigans from the film's characters and vocal talent. Genius, pure genius.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00EV1YZ96", "B00AFEX83C", "B00007LVCM", "B00005JNS0", "B0030IIZ4M", "B00GDT5T9Y", "B003ZHVJGO", "B00G5G7EXY", "B00003CXB4", "B001KVZ6FW", "B0013FSL3E", "B004HO6I4M", "B00005JN4W", "B000MV9026", "B004G600A4", "B000AY74OG", "B000VBJEEG", "B0006UEVT0", "B008YWY0HK", "B003H9M1Q2", "B00CQRN3QI", "B0001I561E", "B0042U94UQ", "B00E9ZATJO", "B000YERP2S", "B0006JMLRK", "B000AAF1TU", "B0000AOX0O", "B00CTNYLQA", "B00F522C7C", "B0039N74CW", "B00003CXCQ", "B001ILFUDC", "B00275EHJG", "B001HN6922", "0736429220", "B000B8QG4A", "B000RMJ4F8", "B0084IHVN4", "B002ZG97YM", "B001ECQ75A", "B004ZBACOE", "B0030IIYYS", "B0084IHVGG", "B00E9ZATKI", "B00AO686JC", "B000GUJZ00", "B00004R99S", "B0012EM5D8", "B0084IHVUC", "B0013ND30M", "B0034JKZ86", "B0000VV4W2", "B00003CX8Y", "B008JFUQ16", "B001DPHDCY", "B00005TN8K", "B00CUDD0C0", "B00A83075M", "B001O5LVPI", "B001NCDFTW", "B00G7TIKMI", "B0000E32WJ", "B00CWM58WY", "B001ILFUD2", "B00009YXAW", "B00CMY3JBO", "B00335EQ0E", "B005LAIISA", "0783231474", "B0002YLCOM", "B00E00OGE2", "B000H7JCK0", "B000UVKGPI", "B00005JMQZ", "B00JK531ES", "B00004U9WQ", "B005LAIH4A", "B005LAIHW2", "B00024I2Z4", "B00I6JOD2S", "B008NNY9QW", "B0000VCZKM", "B00FE8BVF6", "6302526574", "B004EPZ034", "B000L22SG6", "B001OMU6UM", "B00E56D8FO", "B0000524D0", "B002WJI2QQ", "B0009CTT6U", "B000050MN3", "B000B8QG3G", "B0058AFS0O", "B00006FDAI", "B00EGIAQ1K", "B000A7G4TY"], "bought_together": ["B00EV1YZ96", "B00G5G7EXY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00EV1YZ96", "B00AFEX83C", "B00I6JOD2S", "B004HO6I4M"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 7746}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 25.5, "brand": "Disney", "asin": "B00005JM02", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51-difUGanL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)"}
{"description": "Outstanding picture and sound plus tons of features makeCharlie's Angels: Full Throttlea fully loaded DVD.  Don't expect more T&A; in the unrated edition, however.  The only difference is glimpses of more intense violence in a few of the fight scenes.  For example, in the theatrical version you'll see an angel flying through the air, but in the unrated version you'll then see her lying expressionless on the ground.  Also, blood flies out of Drew Barrymore's mouth in one scene.  On his commentary track, director McG discusses inside jokes, visual effects, and shots that didn't quite work for him.  Like a TV sportscaster, he uses a telestrator, but only to occasionally circle items of interest or draw arrows.  There's also an amusing commentary track by the three writers, who chuckle over inside jokes and discuss how the film was changed from the original script.  They preface their comments with: \"I guess they asked us to do this just to prove that writers worked on this movie.\"  \"Who are we kidding?  Who's listening to this right now?\"If you want still more info, there's a trivia track with pop-up factoids with occasional links to more featurettes, a jukebox that offers clips of 11 songs and explanations of why they were picked, a cameo-graphy that offers clips of 13 personalities and why we should know them, and eight 4- to 18-minute featurettes exploring such topics as stunts, vehicles, costumes, and the Pussycat Dolls dance troupe.  And in the next evolution of product placement, the DVD-ROM \"Shop the Scene\" feature allows you to search for a character's outfit or gadget then buy it online.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002A5EBMQ", "B00164EAGY", "B00003CXZ1", "B00AEFYGBA", "B000069HYG", "B0000SX9N2", "B00005JL8Z", "B00004ZDO9", "B008H6GHII", "B000UDGOC0", "B007AFC0RY", "B0006L0LOS", "B000085EFK", "B0007P0Y7C", "B00003CXMP", "B00024JC4E", "B00016MSV2", "B0007PLLBU", "B001C5LLQ4", "B00005MEVO", "B000BKJ758", "B000MX7V70", "B000035Z3G", "B002GHHHL0", "B000LC3ICE", "B000FDFSH2", "B0006GANPA", "B000Y11BC6", "B000AP04FG", "B00026ZG10", "B0041KKYGU", "B00005JMUA", "0767819640", "B0018PH3KQ", "B00008G7UI", "B00BLN4V0A", "B002GOAH1A", "B00006HAWN", "B0001BS3IE", "B0009RCPUW", "B002ZG984Q", "B001EDVNNU", "B000VI70QS", "B004LWZW2O", "B000A343RI", "B0006FO8E8", "B000EGDB10", "B000RW3VCU", "B00005JN4H", "B00BTYMPUY", "B00005J761", "B000CEXGAU", "B005TK0MFE", "B0041ONFOE", "B000VG66XS", "B00ID8H98C", "B00007AJF5", "B00AEFXO8Q", "B0009W5JR8", "B008JFURII", "B00001PE4D", "B000M7FOO8", "B004P7CN7W", "B0000DZ6N3", "B00005JM5B", "B00007GZRP", "B000ARXF96", "B0018CNNV2", "B000CCW2P2", "B0009KA2OA", "B002O3Z4ZW", "B00006G8JD", "B0008FXT1Y", "B0000524E5", "B002GSXKOW", "B00005JM55", "B003Q6D2B4", "B005CFBYW6", "B00008WJD6", "B000ENC5YW", "B003FCKI3O", "B005Z9MFRC", "B00004STVN", "B00005JG6N", "B00E1HIXEI", "B0007OCG56", "B00005JMEW", "B000BTIU4S", "B00008WJEZ", "B000NIBURQ", "B000EQ5V8G", "B0001Z37HM", "B003PIUINS", "B00005JMW7", "B00196UTEG", "B000A2IPQY", "B004SIP6VI", "B00005JLZW", "B00005JNTU", "B00AEFXCLU"], "bought_together": ["B002A5EBMQ", "B00AEFYGBA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002A5EBMQ", "B0000CABE5", "B000069HYG", "B008JFUUIA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 26650}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.9, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B00005JLYW", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51L5TYVcBmL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle (Unrated Widescreen Edition)"}

On the film side, director-screenwriter Mark Steven Johnson and producer Gary Foster's commentary track provides background info and some fawning over Jennifer Garner, a text commentary provides more trivia and inside jokes, and an enhanced viewing mode offers production-design featurettes.

{"description": "A broad science fiction thriller in a classic vein,Equilibriumtakes a respectable stab at aFahrenheit 451-like cautionary fable. The story finds Earth's post-World War III humankind in a state of severe emotional repression: If no one feels anything, no one will be inspired by dark passions to attack their neighbors. Writer-director Kurt Wimmer's monochromatic,Metropolis-influenced cityscape provides an excellent backdrop to the heavy-handed mission of John Preston (Christian Bale), a top cop who busts \"sense offenders\" and crushes sentimental, sensual, and artistic relics from a bygone era. Predictably, Preston becomes intrigued by his victims and that which they die to cherish; he stops taking his mandatory, mood-flattening drug and is even aroused by a doomed prisoner (Emily Watson).

It's much bleaker, as director Danny Boyle and writer Alex Garland say in their optional commentary.  Another alternate ending is almost the same as the theatrical ending but slightly less happy.  Most interesting is the \"radical\" alternate ending that takes an entirely different path midway through the film.  It wasn't filmed, however, so Boyle and Garland narrate the action over storyboards, and it's a surprisingly engrossing 11 minutes.  Boyle and Garland also did a commentary track for the film, and they talk about how they were able to get the shots of deserted London and why they used the ending they did.  There are also six very watchable deleted scenes, and Boyle and Garland's comments range from \"great sequence\" to \"a disgrace.\" Slightly less relevant is a 24-minute documentary that spends its first 10 minutes on the real-life threat of infectious diseases before recapping the film and discussing such elements as the use of digital video and the boot camp the actors had to attend. If you need any further proof that the DVD was a labor of love, even the stills galleries have commentaries.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000TJBN80", "B0002ABURA", "B0006A9FKA", "B002WY65VU", "B00111YM5Q", "B0013D8LAE", "B000IHY9TS", "B000Y7U98C", "B00005JO16", "B0021L8UXA", "B0001611DI", "B0013D8LA4", "B000RJO56O", "B002JT69IW", "B001D2WU9I", "B002VWNIDG", "B0002CHK1S", "B00D7AM6M0", "B003UGLCIA", "B00AEFYYH6", "B001MVYUR0", "B000UAE7O0", "B003EYVXYG", "B000EHRVP6", "B0028DRGDQ", "B0021L8UPS", "B001NPD9LS", "B005LAIIMG", "B000FAOC2W", "B000LP6KNU", "B0006SSOHC", "B000WC3864", "B0013FDM7E", "B00000K3TO", "B000RIWAVW", "B000GCFO0I", "B000O76ZQC", "B004LWZW24", "B000RJO578", "B002VKB0KG", "B006ISJR7U", "B00004TS0G", "B004SIP9MY", "B002VKE1K2", "B00G5GNYY2", "B000N6TX1I", "B0024FADD8", "B005QUQRBU", "B001MYIXAC", "B00D3DJIG8", "B001GUYB08", "B000TGJ80S", "B000V4UFZK", "B004SIP92O", "B00009MGEM", "B0010X73ZG", "B00005K3NR", "B002LMSWN2", "B000063RQQ", "B00000ILDD", "B004BZ5AN2", "0767802519", "B00001QGUM", "B00AJLHUA8", "B002SJIO4A", "B00005JMUA", "B00J5LXT6M", "B005J9ZFQG", "B000QQJ3Q0", "B000AXWHSA", "B00BEIYMAG", "B00005JLWN", "B004BLJQOK", "B0015ET3YO", "B008220BLG", "B000031WD9", "B000069HZP", "B000EQ5SRK", "B0007Y08QA", "B000PMLJMQ", "B000BUNZY2", "B002ZG98UA", "B000V4UH08", "B001JNNDJM", "B003HKN52U", "B003UAKEBW", "B0007DFJ0G", "B0019X3YX2", "B00CE00ZV8", "B00003CXCF", "B0009WFEDC", "B000FS9FE4", "B00005JNJV", "B00011CZRE", "B002T9H2LA", "B000RW5BZ0", "B00005JMXX", "B000WC389G", "B007STBUHI", "B002ZG983M"], "bought_together": ["B000TJBN80", "B002WY65VU"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B008SAPC20", "B003J42JLC", "B000Y7U98C", "B0002ABURA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 37382}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.25, "brand": "Twentieth Century Fox", "asin": "B00005JMA8", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/511KHM89SFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "28 Days Later (Widescreen Special Edition)"}

A truly unforgettable epic, testifying to both the power of hope and the resiliency of the human spirit, The Pianist is a miraculous tale of survival masterfully brought to life by visionary filmmaker Roman Polanski in his most personal movie ever.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00B0U2SFE", "B004SIP8W0", "B004SEUJ82", "B003JLL2RW", "B00005BJWC", "B000087EYX", "B00AEFXRRO", "B00003CWS3", "0312263767", "B00B0U2SEA", "B0064MT1FI", "B003S5TOZG", "B0002CX1NY", "B004SIP7F8", "B00001ZWUS", "0784011710", "B0007R4T3U", "B004ZG5F0K", "B0001DMW9S", "B00G15MDI0", "B000F1IQN2", "B001XJBE16", "B001TUZG4K", "B003K1H14E", "B00005JMLR", "B00166UFTS", "B00005PJ8T", "6305133476", "B002O3Z4WU", "B00005JPKE", "B000KB48NE", "B00000K3TN", "B0007SWPV2", "B004FQX5B6", "B00G4Q3KOC", "B000TGCR38", "B003YKYX7Y", "B0002V7ON8", "B00AEFXVCU", "B00003CXBH", "B00AEFXESQ", "B00DL48BM6", "B000ARTN3I", "B0009RCPUC", "B000M4RG42", "B0072GPQNG", "B000KGGJ0Y", "B00AEBB9CS", "B00007ELEV", "B000KX0IOA", "B00AEFXN9G", "B000093NQZ", "B00AEFXKUI", "B0034BW9E2", "B0033AI48Y", "B006TTC5HC", "B003ELKNH2", "B00275EGWY", "B001TH92N4", "B00005JLO2", "B0028YW3CE", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00860YICC", "B002VWNIBI", "B00003CXZ4", "B0007GAG42", "B003UESJH4", "B00009W5CA", "B00005V9HH", "B004SIP7TE", "B000M341QE", "B007UI0CIA", "B003LMPKSQ", "B00ENMZK1A", "B000LP6KNU", "B00004XPPG", "B000P0J0EW", "B004VWKD4Q", "B006FE83UE", "6305081034", "B0006GAOJA", "B000HC2PLS", "0767802470", "630560097X", "B0000AN4JE", "B002KECJZ8", "0767802519", "B000FDFSYA", "B009XTF8NI", "B000EHSVS2", "B002WBYDR6", "B0000DZTIS", "B00005PJ6V", "B000YKT4BW", "B00018D4PO", "B00005YUO1", "B000KWZ7JC", "B004U7MR1Y", "B00AHTYI5M", "B008JFUNKU"], "bought_together": ["B00B0U2SFE", "B004SEUJ82"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00012QM8G", "B004SIP8W0", "B004SEUJ82", "B0007R4T3U"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 80824}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.34, "brand": "", "asin": "B00005JLT5", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51TBGE434HL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Pianist"}
{"description": "The unrated director's cut ofThe Girl Next Doordelivers about half a minute of extra nudity and sexual footage.  Without adding anything to the running time of the R-rated theatrical cut, the unrated edition substitutes steamier footage into the film Eli watches while talking to Matt, and removes some digitized bikinis in part of the strip-club scene.  (The new cut also has a more threatening scene between Matt and Kelly.)  Don't expect to see more of star Elisha Cuthbert, though; she didn't do any nude scenes, as she explains in one of the five scenes she provides commentary for.  Costar Emile Hirsch does his own commentary for three of the same scenes plus one other, but he's less insightful and more prone to gaps of silence than Cuthbert.

{"description": "Despite super effects, a huge budget, and the cinematic pedigree of alien-happy Steven Spielberg, this take on H.G. Wells's novel is basically a horror film packaged as a sci-fi thrill ride. Instead of a mad slasher, however, Spielberg (along with writers Josh Friedman & David Koepp) utilizes aliens hell-bent on quickly destroying humanity, and the terrifying results that prey upon adult fears, especially in the post-9/11 world. The realistic results could be a new genre, the grim popcorn thriller; often you feel like you're watching Schindler's List more than Spielberg's other thrill-machine movies (Jaws,Jurassic Park). The film centers on Ray Ferrier, a divorced father (Tom Cruise, oh so comfortable) who witnesses one giant craft destroy his New Jersey town and soon is on the road with his teen son (Justin Chatwin) and preteen daughter (Dakota Fanning) in tow, trying to keep ahead of the invasion. The film is, of course, impeccably designed and produced by Spielberg's usual crew of A-class talent. The aliens are genuinely scary, even when the film--like the novel--spends a good chunk of time in a basement. Readers of the book (or viewers of the deft 1953 adaptation) will note the variation of whom and how the aliens come to Earth, which poses some logistical problems. The film opens and closes with narration from the novel read by Morgan Freeman, but Spielberg could have adapted Orson Welles's words from the famous Halloween Eve 1938 radio broadcast: \"We couldn't soap all your windows and steal all your garden gates by tomorrow night, so we did the best next thing: we annihilated the world.\"--Doug ThomasWar of the Worldsat Amazon.comThe SoundtrackThe War of the Worlds(1953)War of the Worlds - The Complete First Season(TV series)Classic Sci-Fi Movies and Their RemakesAliens Invade on DVDThe Prog-rock Opera (no kidding)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEBB8VK", "B00005JL78", "B001SGEUYW", "B00008G8M4", "B00005JL3T", "B0013FDM7E", "B00AEFXNLY", "B00005JMXX", "B001OQCV2E", "B000VECAD0", "B002O3Z510", "B0002V7OI8", "B000H30B2C", "B000EGDB10", "B00005JN2Z", "B005LAIIMG", "B005PTYP70", "B002O3Z50G", "B0002V7ON8", "B00005JN0T", "B00K2CHW48", "B002SJIO4A", "0783225547", "B008JFUO36", "B00005JKLZ", "B00AS1Q93S", "1936594056", "B004EPYZUS", "B001TUZG4K", "B00AEFXR1K", "B00001ZWUS", "B00AEFXYJA", "0767817478", "B0034G4ORC", "B003QO8TOQ", "B00070FX5U", "B0045HCJSA", "B00000G3PA", "B005LAIHPE", "B003Y5H5GK", "B00AEBBA72", "B00003CWU3", "B00I9TDMRM", "B001ECDVKE", "B00003CXXP", "B000V4UFZK", "B0010X73ZG", "B001DZOC6Y", "B00005JKFR", "B000XT1P4S", "B003HKN52U", "B0009PW4D2", "B000HRMAPE", "B004EPYZPS", "B0018QPPXW", "B0002WZTOI", "B00AEBB9LO", "B004LWZW4M", "B003ABZHAO", "B003YJFALS", "B0087ZG7HK", "B000OT6V64", "B004P7CN7W", "B000CCBC9O", "B00000ILDD", "0767803434", "B001L57ZYM", "B000065V3G", "B007STBUHI", "B002ZG980U", "B008JFUQZ2", "B00005B6JZ", "B0006GANOQ", "B000F1IQN2", "1494343576", "B001GCUO02", "B00004Y87O", "0783226810", "B004EPYZSK", "B000P0J0BU", "B005LAIHXQ", "B001680M26", "B000EQHXN2", "B0045HCJFS", "B00004BZIY", "B00008G8M5", "B00003CXQA", "B008JFUS0U", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00EIN6KJ0", "B0000DZ6N3", "B000MV8A9A", "B00005JKYX", "B0000YEEGM", "B000TGJ8CQ", "B0013FCWUW", "B002ZG9864", "B00003CWTI", "B008MIMWQW", "B00IKM5OCO"], "bought_together": ["B00AEBB8VK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AEBB8VK", "B004LWZW4M", "B00005JL78", "B004EPYZSK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 18739}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.95, "brand": "Dreamworks Skg", "asin": "B00005JNTI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51upxzPRnXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "War of the Worlds"}

{"description": "The delightful designs of William Joyce (writer/illustrator of such popular children's books asGeorge ShrinksandBently & Egg) makeRobotsa joy to behold. The round, bouncy, and ramshackle forms of hero Rodney Copperbottom and his computer-animated friends are part of an ornate and daffyFender providing assistance.Rube-Goldberg universe of elaborate contraptions and gleaming metallic surfaces.  Rodney (voiced with a hint-of-Scottish lilt by Ewan McGregor) is a young inventor who sets off for Robot City to work for Big Weld (Mel Brooks), the supreme inventor of the mechanical world.  But upon his arrival, Rodney discovers that Big Weld has disappeared, and the slick, shiny Ratchet (Greg Kinnear,As Good As It Gets) is phasing out the spare parts that lumpen robots need to function and replacing them with \"upgrades\"--expensive and glistening new exoskeletons. Unfortunately, from this suitable beginning, the story degenerates into a series of action sequences that make very little sense, though some are kinetic and fun (though others are only there to serve the inevitableRobotsvideo game). Most kids will enjoy the sheer visual pleasure of the movie, but compared to the narrative richness of Pixar movies likeThe IncrediblesandToy Story, that pleasure is pretty short-lived. Also featuring the voices of Robin Williams, Halle Berry, Jim Broadbent, Amanda Bynes, Jennifer Coolidge, and many, many more.--Bret FetzerDVD FeaturesJennifer Coolidge returns as the voice of Aunt Fanny in a mildly amusing new short, \"Aunt Fanny's Tour of Booty,\" which allows her to again be the butt of the joke.  Fans of the characters will enjoy both a 17-minute discussion of the robots' creation as well as profiles of 11 of the bots, including early, almost unrecognizable conceptual sketches and brief interviews with the voice cast.  The original short is fairly dull, and of the three deleted scenes, the most finished is an extended version of Rodney's initial meeting with Tim at the gate.  One other is in sketch form only but does preserve another performance by Robin Williams.  The kids' games are pretty good.  There's a dancing robot that will perform eight routines on command or in random order.  A memory game has a bit of replay value, and the build-a-bot segment takes some thought and investigation.  The Xbox demo is a nifty little diversion that transforms one element (the transport-pod race) of the full-length, single-player Xbox game into a frenetic one- to four-player free-for-all.In their commentary track, director Chris Wedge and producer-inspiration William Joyce have to remind each other to stop patting themselves on the back, but it is interesting to hear them talk about old games such as Mousetrap that played a part in developing the film.  (Wedge's frequent references to a possible \"director's cut\" might not seem like a joke to DVD buyers who have gotten tired of DVD rereleases.)  The commentary track by the Blue Sky technical team might be better, offering insights into the characters and the creation of the film without lapsing into too much techie-speak.--David HoriuchiStills fromRobots(click for larger image)The World ofRobotsThe Art of RobotsRobotssoundtrackRobotsscoreRobotsfor XboxRobotsfor PS2Robotsfor GBA", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0006JMLRK", "B000M343BC", "B002WJI2QQ", "B001DPHDCY", "B0012EM5D8", "B004HO6I4M", "B00003CXJ4", "B00CWM58WY", "B000MV9026", "B0006UEVT0", "B001GCUO7A", "0783231474", "B005SDUV4E", "B000RMJ4F8", "B0000640SC", "B000ROAK2W", "B0013FSL3E", "B001LPWGFA", "B004EPZ034", "B001U3D88M", "B000ION23A", "B005LAIISA", "B0000AOX0O", "B000UFIYOO", "B001PR0YEE", "6305161887", "B00029LO0Y", "B008NNY9QW", "B000G75AZC", "B000H7JCK0", "B006JD48LO", "B000L22SG6", "B00B7EQPNE", "B001ECQ75A", "B004AKCME8", "B000AY74OG", "B000VBJEEG", "B00F522C7C", "B000DWMYQ8", "B002ZG97YM", "B008JFUQ16", "B004LWZW7Y", "B000BITUVG", "B0000VV4W2", "B005LAIH4A", "B00003CXG7", "B00005JMQZ", "B00007LVCM", "B0042U94UQ", "B00CHVJODE", "B001PR0Y7Q", "B00E9ZATJO", "B00009M9BK", "0449810798", "B0090SI1RM", "B00BG0RSJ4", "B001KVZ6FW", "1620575175", "B009AMAH3O", "B00I6JOD2S", "B000CZ0PT4", "B0013FSWT2", "B0034G4OYA", "B00AFEX83C", "B000UVKGPI", "B000065V42", "B0039N74CW", "B00JK531ES", "B00HLTD2OE", "B002ZG9904", "B00009YXAW", "6305123454", "B005FLSZQU", "B00005JM7T", "B001GCUNWQ", "B003UESJF6", "B00E00OGE2", "B001HN6918", "B000GUJZ00", "B00I0VTOMG", "B00005JNS0", "B00365F6I2", "B000EQ5UHS", "B000LPS2VI", "B00005JN4W", "B000B8QFYG", "B001NCDFTW", "B0030ZIZRC", "B00CTNYLQA", "B00G5G7EXY", "B007FF3HQM", "B00947N6D8", "B00EBBGLFC", "B005QODEEE", "B00ALMNCLQ", "B00362RUX4", "B00005JN0T", "B000GIXEWC", "B00005TN8K", "B005LAIIT4"], "bought_together": ["B00CWM58WY", "B004HO6I4M"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00CWM58WY", "B004HO6I4M", "B002WJI2QQ", "B001DPHDCY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 3335}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.95, "brand": "Fox Home Entertainment", "asin": "B00005JNQS", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61RM90ARRPL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Robots (Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "More than a few critics hailedSpider-Man 2as \"the best superhero movie ever,\" and there's no compelling reason to argue--thanks to a bigger budget, better special effects, and a dynamic, character-driven plot, it's a notch aboveSpider-Manin terms of emotional depth and rich comic-book sensibility.Ordinary PeopleOscar-winner Alvin Sargent received screenplay credit, and celebrated author and comic-book expert Michael Chabon worked on the story, but it's director Sam Raimi's affinity for the material that bringsSpidey 2to vivid life. When a fusion experiment goes terribly wrong, a brilliant physicist (Alfred Molina) is turned into Spidey's newest nemesis, the deranged, mechanically tentacled \"Doctor Octopus,\" obsessed with completing his experiment and killing Spider-Man (Tobey Maguire) in the process. Even more compelling is Peter Parker's urgent dilemma: continue his burdensome, lonely life of crime-fighting as Spider-Man, or pursue love and happiness with Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst)? Molina's outstanding as a tragic villain controlled by his own invention, and the action sequences are nothing less than breathtaking, but the real success ofSpider-Man 2is its sense of priorities. With all of Hollywood's biggest and best toys at his disposal, Raimi and his writers stay true to the Marvel mythology, honoringSpider-Mancreators Stan Lee and Steve Ditko, and setting the bar impressively high for the challenge ofSpider-Man 3.--Jeff ShannonDVD Features:The first commentary track is by director Sam Raimi and a self-deprecating Tobey Maguire speaking in tandem, and producer (and Marvel CEO) Avi Arad and coproducer Grant Curtis speaking in tandem. They discuss a number of topics, including Raimi's memory of his excitement over Richard Donner's Superman and how the character of Black Cat had to be dropped from the film. The second commentary is by six members of the Oscar-nominated effects team, and one of their primary focuses is how Doc Ock's arms were achieved by a combination of puppetry and CGI.The centerpiece of the second disc is a massive two-hour documentary that can be viewed all at once or in 12 separate pieces. It covers the development of the story, the visual effects, costumes, stunts, and sound and music. Three shorter featurettes cover Peter Parker's struggle between his personal and hero lives, Doc Ock, and the women in Spider-Man's life, and what's interesting is how they discuss those topics not just in relation to the movies but to the comic books as well.

{"description": "The supercharged possibilities of a single set and two amped-up actors are explored inHard Candy, a twisted cocktail with a poison kicker. After a flirtatious encounter in an online chat room, two people agree to meet for coffee:  a 32-year-old man (Patrick Wilson) and a 14-year-old girl (Ellen Page). They quickly advance to his house, and just as quickly, the apparent pedophilic seduction morphs into something else entirely. After the tables turn,Hard Candybecomes a tale of revenge and torture that might have tempted a filmmaker like Park Chanwook. Here, first-time feature director David Slade opts for a slick look that stays close to the actors, and you can't really blame him--this movie is like a conceptual, more-than-slightly unbelievable off-Broadway play, a showcase for actors and \"controversial\" ideas. Those actors are strong:  Patrick Wilson (Angels in America,Phantom of the Opera) is every bit as creepy as he needs to be, and Ellen Page has nothing short of a triumph. The Canadian actress was around 18 when she shot the film, but looks like an adolescent, which makes her authoritative wrath all the more shocking to witness. The provocations ofHard Candysometimes seem arbitrary or forced, but Page's electrifying performance can't be denied, or dismissed.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0017VG5XM", "B00177YA6U", "B002VPTJOA", "B000ARFPMQ", "B004U7MR3W", "B0037E8HOC", "B00DVD5STQ", "B000YABYLA", "B00187FPC2", "B001MEJY8W", "B000WC38EQ", "B0013D8L7M", "B002EOVXBK", "B000FVQM2Y", "B000UCD4L0", "B00009MEC4", "B0051PLQR0", "6305313687", "B001G9CNI6", "B005Z9MGRG", "B003U6SJY0", "B008NNY8XQ", "B00125WATQ", "B0014VPFVS", "B00006AUIG", "B00DMUFXOS", "B001J4E19C", "B002VPTJNQ", "B00000I1KK", "B003L20IEC", "B004OUZLGK", "B000N3SU92", "B00699G622", "B00005Q4CS", "B0057ZAA6W", "B00005JMJG", "B008G1JIQC", "B0021L8UPS", "B00441GYVK", "B0007PID84", "B000NO39FG", "B00B96TGQS", "B001B187L6", "B000OYCMLM", "B005SQRYB4", "B0000AOX0A", "B000A2X3U2", "B00G5GNYY2", "B008G33PIM", "B0020LH8WU", "6305428484", "B000MMMTBY", "B002LMSWN2", "B007CZ3E7C", "B002USF1WC", "B004SIP9Z6", "B00005U14H", "0767802519", "B00AEFY2AA", "B0001GF2D8", "B001D2WU9I", "B00009W0U4", "B0000694XX", "B004LWZW24", "B0083QN87K", "B004Z1HY2W", "B000HC2LFI", "B0002J4X1Q", "B0000CABGW", "B007L6VRBM", "B0001EFUFK", "B003626TNG", "B009XTF8KQ", "B00ELQHX5O", "B007UW9W8W", "B001JNNDJM", "157362408X", "B0058ZPNOK", "B000EOTVU2", "B0082CWTSY", "B00AZTUUQK", "B001C5LLVE", "B000PKG8TM", "B00003CWQR", "B00007976U", "B001CDFY64", "B004XVMCH6", "B00003CWN3", "B0028DRGDQ", "B000FS2W3A", "B001U0HBQA", "B000N3AW6G", "B00005QAOZ", "B00BSU0FQA", "B00003CXKM", "B0002MPQRS", "B00BEIYGT8", "B0004Z31OS", "B001AZKB8K"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002VPTJOA", "B00177YA6U", "B001MEJY8W", "B0017VG5XM"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 421858}, "asin": "B00005JP3W", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51FEBBE1B9L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Hard Candy"}

{"description": "Leonardo DiCaprio puts a handsome face on an ugly industry: In parts of Africa, diamond mining fuels civil warfare, killing thousands of innocents and drafting preteen children as vicious soldiers. DiCaprio (The Departed) plays Danny Archer, a white African soldier-turned-diamond-smuggler who gets wind of a large raw jewel found by Solomon Vandy, a native fisherman (Djimon Hounsou,In America) recently escaped from enslavement by a brutal rebel leader. Archer offers a deal: He'll help Vandy find his war-scattered family if Vandy will share the diamond with him. Drawn into this web of exploitation is journalist Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly,Little Children), who agrees to help if Archer will tell her the details of how conflict diamonds make their way into the hands of the corporations who sell them to the Western world. DiCaprio is compelling because he never flinches from Archer's utter ruthlessness; Archer ends up doing the morally justifiable thing, but only because his desperate greed has led him to it. Hounsou and Connelly, though saddled with all the moral and political speeches, rise above the cant and keep the movie's treacherously formulaic plot rooted in human characters. But in the end, the story won't stick with you as much as the dead stillness in the child soldiers' eyes; the horror of African civil strife refuses to be contained byBlood Diamond's uplifting message--and the movie is all the more potent as a result.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001N44BVQ", "B000M341QE", "B00005JLSB", "B00AEBB8NI", "B00080ZG10", "B004SIP7TE", "B006OFN0SE", "B002ZG980U", "B000NIVJF4", "B0007R4T3U", "B0016Q2D66", "B00049QQHI", "B001EZE5DI", "B00003CWM3", "B00008DP4C", "6305268827", "B000BYA5G4", "B00AEBB9F0", "B000Y7WGOW", "B004SIP7ZS", "B000065U1N", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B000095WW8", "B000U7169M", "B00DHHWXYY", "B000GFLKF8", "B004SIP8ZM", "B002O3Z510", "B002VWNIEA", "B002ZG99N6", "B0007DFJ0G", "B005LAIIJY", "0792839137", "B000KP62SE", "B000P0J0EW", "B000P0J09M", "B007SPPANM", "B00004XPPG", "B000C20VPA", "B00011CZRE", "B002QEHPQU", "B00005JN2Z", "B00AEBB9CS", "B00003CXWV", "B00AEFY5B6", "B00001ZWUS", "B00H9KKGTO", "B00005JN0W", "B002T9H2LA", "B000MTEFXC", "B003L20IG0", "B00AEBB86A", "B00005JKBC", "B0013XZ2QK", "B0000ACOXL", "B005LAIGRS", "B002AT8K9W", "B0007KIFGE", "B00AZNEW5G", "B003ASLJO0", "B000T28PII", "B002DU39GW", "B002ZG97RE", "B000LC55F2", "B00003CXTG", "B00AEBBA36", "B00B0U2SFE", "B003ASLJQI", "B002CPMB9O", "B00BB67UNW", "B000MXPE7O", "0783231202", "B000FVQLQQ", "B00AEFXVCU", "B00AEFXRRO", "B000A3XY5A", "B002JCSWV6", "B00005JNQA", "B004EPYZP8", "B0050MB4OO", "B000P0J0AG", "B000C65Z1G", "B00275EGWY", "B00005B6JZ", "B0006GANPA", "B00AEBB9NM", "B002XMGGK6", "B000C20VRS", "B0007P0XBO", "B003UESJME", "B000QXDED6", "B00AHTYI5M", "B001P9KR8U", "B004A8ZX28", "B008JFUNKU", "B003ASLJQS", "B002VWNICC", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00005BCKF", "B000NOIX48"], "bought_together": ["B000M341QE", "B002ZG980U"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AEBB8NI", "B00H9KKGTO", "B008MILL8W", "B000BYA5G4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 106777}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.96, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00005JPGO", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61MN8-6skUL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Blood Diamond (Two-Disc Special Edition)"}
{"description": "One of the first things a viewer notices aboutCloverfieldis that it doesn't play by ordinary storytelling rules, making this intriguing horror film as much a novelty as an event. Told from the vertiginous point-of-view of a camcorder-wielding group of friends,Cloverfieldbegins like a primetime television soap opera about young Manhattanites coping with changes in their personal lives. Rob (Michael Stahl-David) is leaving New York to take an executive job at a company in Japan. At his goodbye party in a crowded loft, Rob&#x92;s brother Jason (Mike Vogel) hands a camcorder to best friend Hud (T.J. Miller), who proceeds to tape the proceedings over old footage of Rob&#x92;s ex-girlfriend, Beth (Odette Yustman)--images shot during happy times in that now-defunct relationship. Naturally, Beth shows up at the party with a new beau, bumming Rob out completely. Just before one's eyes glaze over from all this heartbreaking stuff (captured by Hud, who's something of a doofus, in laughably shaky camerawork), the unexpected happens: New York is suddenly under attack from a Godzilla-like monster stomping through midtown and destroying everything and everybody in sight. Rob and company hit the streets, but rather than run with other evacuees, they head toward the center of the storm so that Rob can rescue an injured Beth. There are casualties along the way, but the journey into fear is fascinating and immediate if emotionally remote--a consequence of seeing these proceedings through the singular, subjective perspective of a camcorder and of a story that intentionally leaves major questions unanswered: Who or what is this monster? Where did it come from? The lack of a backstory, and spare views of the marauding creature, are clever ways by producer J.J. Abrams and director Matt Reeves to keep an audience focused exclusively on what&#x92;s on the screen.  But it also makesCloverfieldcuriously uninvolving. Ultimately,Cloverfield, with its spectacular effects brilliantly woven into a home-video look, is a celebration of infinite possibilities in this age of accessible, digital media.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B004EPYZQ2", "B00IO9D3ZI", "B00EMMDMKM", "B002SJIO5E", "B0044ZOI32", "B001AR0D4A", "B004BZ5AMS", "B001MVYUQQ", "B003BJO8KU", "B0018AG6X6", "B005LAIGPU", "B00IO8VMB6", "B000PKG8SS", "B003Y5H5GU", "B00BPA2PGG", "B0017U7PT6", "B001YV502C", "B0013FBS20", "B008JFUR10", "B001KZVQJI", "B001CW7ZW6", "B0035WTJFW", "B000Y7U98W", "B003ABZGRI", "B000VDDWEC", "B000VDDWEM", "B002JT69IM", "B00164EAC8", "B002ZG981E", "B00AEFXORM", "B001DZOC3W", "B008SAPC20", "B003Y5H59M", "B00HERVMTK", "B00AVSFIV2", "B0032KNA4I", "B000L212HW", "B001FB55I0", "B0018O4YSQ", "B002ZG997M", "B002ZG9788", "B008G33O0G", "B000VDDWE2", "B00K2CHVSK", "B001GCUO5W", "B005J4TLQG", "B000PC6A3E", "B0027VT9ES", "B001F7MSG6", "B0051T46XM", "B00111YM60", "B001GZ6QEC", "B002HR1W1K", "B004SIPA4G", "B001OQCVII", "B001JNNDBA", "B001GKJ2FC", "B000WQWPKA", "B000OT6V00", "B0021L8UXK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004EPYZQ2", "B00IO8VMB6", "B004LWZW4W", "B005LAIHY0"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "asin": "B00005JPXY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Wm5GO98oL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Cloverfield [Theatrical Release]"}
{"description": "Here's hoping James Mangold's big, raucous, and ultrabloody remake of3:10 to Yumaleads some moviegoers to check outDelmer Daves's beautifully lean, half-century-old original. That classic Western spun a tale of captured outlaw Ben Wade (Glenn Ford)--deadly but disarmingly affable--and the small-time rancher and family man, Dan Evans (Van Heflin), desperate enough to accept the job of helping escort the badman to Yuma prison. Wade, knowing that his gang will be along at any moment to spring him, works at persuading the ultimately lone deputy to accept a bribe, turn his back on \"duty,\" and go home safe and rich to his family. That the outlaw has come to admire his captor intriguingly complicates the suspense.All of the above applies in the new3:10, but it takes a lot more huffing and puffing to get Wade (Russell Crowe this time) and Evans (Christian Bale) into position for the showdown. Mostly, more is less. To Mangold's credit, his movie doesn't traffic in facile irony or postmodern detachment; it aims to be a straight-up Western and deliver the excitement and charisma the genre's fans are starved for. But recognizing that contemporary viewers might be out of touch with the bedrock simplicity and strength of the genre--not to mention its code of honor--Mangold has supplied both Evans and Wade with a plethora of backstory and \"motivations.\" At the overblown action climax, the crossfire of personal agendas is almost as frenetic as the copious gunplay. (By that point the movie has killed more people than the Lincoln County War.)Best thing about the remake is Russell Crowe's Ben Wade, a Scripture-quoting career villain with an artist's eye and a curiously principled sense of whom and when to murder. As his second-in-command, Ben Foster fairly pirouettes at every opportunity to commit mayhem, and Peter Fonda contributes a fierce portrait of an old Wade adversary turned bounty hunter for the Pinkerton detective agency.--Richard T.

{"description": "61*is an endearing ode to the baseball days of yore when the press was the enemy, salaries were in check, and breaking records with bat and glove took on Ruthian proportions. In 1961 baseball expanded its season from 154 games to 162, allowing weaker pitching into the major leagues and two New York Yankees teammates--the colorless Roger Maris and golden boy Mickey Mantle--to make an assault on the sport's ultimate record: Babe Ruth's 60 home runs. To add to the stew, baseball commissioner Ford Frick announced any record set in the last eight games of the season wouldn't count toward the official record; records had to be achieved in 154 games.Director Billy Crystal guarantees success for his movie in the perfect casting of the leads. Barry Pepper (Saving Private Ryan's religious sniper) is deft as Maris, and Thomas Jane is a perfect Mantle, a superman in a Yankee uniform. Despite the differences between family man Maris and hard-living Mantle, they form a rewarding friendship amid the media and fan frenzy. The shy Maris took the brunt of the storm, even facing boo-birds in his home stadium. Crystal and first-time writer Hank Steinberg keep the pace moving quickly between the field, the locker room, the press box, and the home front. The film never tries to dazzle with more than the facts (and it softens Mantle up a bit), yet it belongs on the short list of grand baseball movies.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0010YSD90", "B009NNM9OA", "B00009AOAX", "B000MNOX94", "B0012YYZDG", "078324021X", "B00DW5IKW0", "B0060ZJ7BC", "B000068NNU", "B00AATUZLU", "B0068FZ0GK", "B0010YSD8Q", "B004X2TYG2", "B005SQRYEG", "B009POCG2C", "0800177258", "B00E1HIWTO", "B00F3LSXPA", "B00AEFYKWU", "B003VE9WTW", "B001BSBBF8", "B000FOPPDI", "B000R7HY46", "B000FTCLRG", "B0007LLPXI", "B00AEFXHNI", "B00DNF1SSC", "B00028HBES", "B000MNOX80", "B00720ONHM", "B00009AOAW", "B000069I1K", "B0000633U2", "B0006GAI5U", "B000053V7F", "B000J3OTT6", "B008KNC46W", "0792843592", "B007FQXEXW", "B000063JDN", "B0006Q941Y", "B000A0GXRO", "B00004W221", "B00IB3SDRK", "B000EXZFCQ", "B001KRCDT8", "B002E01LOI", "B00284EMI2", "B006TTC5B8", "B0001US66Y", "B002DQL34Q", "B00158K0QU", "B004J713LK", "B00005NTOI", "B00005NGAZ", "B00005JKE4", "B004GJYRF0", "B009NNM9TU", "6305428492", "B00005JPBO", "B00AMSQBP8", "B002VECM6S", "B000FVR1T2", "B000ND91WC", "B003S1UNZU", "B000CNFC76", "B00478ED1S", "B001BL96JI", "B005HQ5SDQ", "B002AT8KD8", "B00007LP8J", "B00005RIIY", "1451676719", "B000X5RBXG", "B002O3Z4XY", "B000HREKP2", "B000MNOX9E", "B00076YP0I", "B000WPE8Q0", "B00EE41SAY", "B0013XZ760", "B00DQCSWUE", "B00004TJQJ", "0743268938", "B0036APHRC", "B00CLSBNNM", "0060883537", "B008H6GHHY", "0783117531", "B00003CWUX", "B00AEFXOKO", "B004QRUN8M", "B00AEFXJY0", "B000G8P1Y6", "6304584210", "B0095YMNGG", "B0007LLPWO", "B008LW25CK", "B000R7HY4G"], "bought_together": ["B009NNM9OA", "B0068FZ0GK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B009NNM9OA", "B0068FZ0GK", "B004X2TYG2", "B0060ZJ7BC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 2990}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 8.26, "brand": "Team Marketing", "asin": "B00005M20J", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51x7vQtkO-L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "61*"}

{"description": "The \"Spectacular, Spectacular\" theme ofMoulin Rougecontinues with the two-DVD set's dazzling array of extras, a must-watch for theMoulin Rougefanatic. The first disc contains the film along with two commentary tracks--one with Baz Luhrmann, the production designer, and the cinematographer, the second with Luhrmann and Craig Pearce, the writers of the film. Both commentaries contain lots of interesting and fun facts about the making of the film, including back story on the characters that was eventually cut, Courtney Love's long deliberation before allowing the use of Nirvana's \"Teen Spirit,\" and contributions to the story made by the film's stars.The second disc contains a making-of documentary, amusing footage of McGregor and Kidman goofing around on the set, and interviews with all the major stars. Deleted scenes, extended dance numbers, the MTV music-awards performance of \"Lady Marmalade,\" and many more extras make for a detailed look insideMoulin Rougethat's bursting with as much energy as the nightclub itself.--Mindy Ruehmann", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0007TKNII", "B004SEUJBE", "B002ZG976U", "B00005BJ2O", "B005S9EK5Y", "B00AEBBAEK", "B001FB55OE", "B00006D295", "B002G1K82Q", "B001MT7ZEW", "B000E1YVZU", "B001GKJ2DY", "6304806418", "B002D0L0R2", "B00GTO6WXU", "B000K7VHLY", "B001PPGAIA", "B00DHHWXYY", "B00005JLZW", "B003Y5H574", "B00AEFY5TI", "B00AEFYM2S", "B00AEFXTKO", "B009NYF2GQ", "B00004XMTJ", "B0001GOH6Q", "B0000524E5", "B00005YW4Z", "B000683VI4", "B0000DIXDR", "B00005JMJG", "B0036TGSIK", "B001HN69C2", "B00006ZXSK", "B004SIPAJG", "B00447L4KA", "B002NZK5TG", "B0001V6ZJ8", "B00AEFY0F2", "B001LMAKAG", "B00AFEY354", "B00AEFXESQ", "B002D0L0QS", "B0007WFXZI", "B00003CXC3", "B002ZG975Q", "B005MYEQ4U", "B000FVQLQQ", "B004SIP7PS", "B0000AM6IY", "B00006ZXSL", "B000RPCK2E", "B00AEFZ6V4", "B00005QW5X", "B002LE8MGW", "B000XJD33O", "B004SIP6BI", "B005SFR7YE", "B002ZG988M", "B000YABYLA", "B001AEF6BS", "B004QSQMKE", "B004SEUIXS", "B00005JMJ4", "B0041KKYEM", "B000J3OTSM", "B000HT3PGU", "B0045HCJJY", "B000E33W1W", "B001K2LFNI", "B00C888MJ8", "B001OQCUYI", "B002NZK5V4", "B00AEFY4CG", "B004SIP7F8", "B00005JPSM", "B00CNW9ZI6", "B00AEFXZ1C", "B000AP04FG", "B00005JOC9", "B0001HAISG", "B004EPYZU8", "B000URDCC6", "B005LAIIHG", "6305428425", "B004P7CNZO", "B00AEFXO8Q", "B0007939M0", "B00AEFXZVM", "B002T9H2LA", "B008JFUNYG", "0783240287", "B00070HK24", "B001AGXEAG", "B000ELJAEM", "B004QL7K6G", "B003UYUQZW", "B0011U52E2", "B0000714BP"], "bought_together": ["B0007TKNII", "B005S9EK5Y"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002ZG976U", "B0007TKNII", "B004SEUIWO", "B00006D295"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 62798}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 19.95, "brand": "Twentieth Century Fox", "asin": "B00005QZ7U", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51E4KFHE9EL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)"}

Best aboutCrittersis what's not present.

{"description": "Rupert Everett narrates this sensitive documentary about the Nazi persecution of homosexuals during World War II. \"Paragraph 175\" refers to the old German penal code concerning homosexuality, which was used to justify the prosecution of gay men during the war (the code ignored lesbians, still considered viable baby-making vessels). As mere rumor became enough to justify imprisonment, over 100,000 were arrested and between 10,000 and 15,000 were sent to concentration camps. InParagraph 175, Klaus M&uuml;ller, a historian from the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, sets out to interview the fewer than 10 who are known to remain alive. The film covers the astonishingly quick rise of Hitler (one interviewee points out how ridiculous a figure he seemed at first) and the shock that more liberal Germans felt as it became clear that he was a force to be reckoned with. Some of the film's most touching moments come when the participants reminisce about their first loves and the \"homosexual Eden\" that was Berlin in the 1930s. This is a beautifully well made documentary that poignantly captures a piece of nearly forgotten history.--Ali Davis", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00HHYF5EI", "B00EU8RB14", "B00HUQCA28", "B0001Y4LDM", "B00996RSYM", "B00008R9KB", "B00EJUXNOM", "B00E849QSG", "B00GHP8SH4", "1555830064", "B00005YUO1", "B00FGG60XY", "B00F98FOPE", "B000067D0Y", "B004EI2NWM", "B000YHQNCI", "B001BMN35K", "B00005JO5L", "0299165043", "0156005816", "B00DYA7Y8Y", "B00005JMLR", "B000ADWCV2", "B000092T3P", "B007HC8DX0", "B002Y3GZD2", "B00FL2EWYM", "B000F6II1M", "B00B2DGYQS", "B003IG06PM", "B003BR8ME0", "B0096UG7XY", "B0007TKOS2", "B00A92MGLA", "B000MGUZFW", "6305847045", "B00B02QUOC", "B004GFGUDQ", "B00005AWR9", "B009SFR2QI", "B005FQN524", "B00AWQEK26", "0062196243", "0304329568", "0306807564", "B0016MXK9O", "B00668IE9O", "B000CNEZ1A", "B0089N7STG", "B0002TT08W", "B003BV8I86", "B000IJ7A6A", "B005AY110O", "1932134670", "B000GBEWI4"], "bought_together": ["B00008R9KB"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0299165043", "0465018483", "0805006001", "1555830064"]}, "price": 29.95, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 46812}, "asin": "B00005YUP1", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Z0M4V12NL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Paragraph 175"}

At the start ofStrong PoisonHarriet (Harriet Walter) is on trial for murder. Lord Peter (Edward Petherbridge) becomes enchanted by her and decides she cannot possibly be guilty. What follows are the twin stories of Lord Peter's search to find the real killer and his romantic pursuit of Harriet. Both are charming. As always, Sayers has plotted her story brilliantly, with a satisfying mystery and a sly comic touch (a gentle poke at the spiritualist movement is particularly fun). The period atmosphere is pulled off naturally and with close attention to detail, and the adaptation has a careful reverence for Sayers's novel. The performances are all remarkably strong. Both leads capture the peculiar romance of sharp minds quite well, and Richard Morant is quietly fantastic as the remarkable Bunting.--Ali Davis", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000062XDZ", "B000062XE0", "B00JJRLFTU", "B000068UE9", "B009DS6YGO", "B002TY78PU", "B000062XDX", "B00A8KJLPM", "B008645ZXY", "B005SH65S6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000062XDX", "B000062XDZ", "B00BDSRM4K", "B009DS6YGO"]}, "price": 42.86, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 299448}, "asin": "B000062XDY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5152KH81VGL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Dorothy L.

{"description": "The fifth season ofStar Trek: The Next Generationsaw some of the very best of all 178 shows. \"Darmok\" had the feel of a \"classicTrek\" episode, dealing with language as metaphor. \"The First Duty\" challenged Wesley Crusher's loyalties. The season closer \"Time's Arrow\" (which concluded in year 6) ranks as one of the bestTNGcliffhangers, and treats fans to canon-changing story lines and tons of in-jokes. Best of all was the painfully melancholy \"The Inner Light,\" in which Picard experiences an alternate lifetime. There were great guest stars--Paul Winfield (\"Darmok\"), Ashley Judd (\"The Game\"), Kelsey Grammar (\"Cause and Effect\"), Famke Janssen (\"The Perfect Mate\"), and Jerry Hardin (\"Time's Arrow\")--and as always there were contributions from Q, Lwaxana, and Barclay, too.After the confidence of the previous two years, however, year 5 often disappointed by not seeing a good idea through to the end. Denise Crosby was swept back under the carpet in the Klingon soap opener (\"Redemption, Part II\"). No one could make the prospect ofDeep Space 9attractive enough to Michelle Forbes, so her fantastic performance as Ensign Ro seems wasted in retrospect. And no one could reschedule Robin Williams to guest star, so we had Matt Frewer instead (\"A Matter of Time\"). Of all stories to use Leonard Nimoy in, \"Unification\" wallowed in Romulan politics instead of anything emotionally engaging. Gene Roddenberry wanted to introduce a gay character, but mere months after his death all we got was the trite \"The Outcast.\" This was inarguably where the series weakened, without the Great Bird overseeing what was going on. Worst of all, his hard-as-nails bad guys the Borg were given a touchy-feely side in \"I, Borg.\" Fans and critics now appreciate that the behind-the-scenes focus had shifted fromThe Next Generationto the next spinoff, and it would never fully return.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00BHWG0DQ", "B000063V8S", "B00BHWG0CM", "B000063V8R", "B000062XFG", "B00005Y1NF", "B00BHWG0G8", "B00BHWG1AI", "B00005JLF5", "B000127LW2", "B00008972H", "B0002WZTCA", "B000228EBS", "B0007TKH66", "B00008KA5A", "B0001NBNFW", "B00062IDLA", "B0009I7NGW", "B0002JP4GE", "B00008KA59", "B00062IDCO", "B000AOEMXC", "B00008KGT0", "B002I9Z8GM", "B00008KA58", "B000A6CLL0", "B00008KA57", "B00062IDDS", "B00062RCC6", "B001DHXT6G", "B001DHXT3Y", "B0000AUHOH", "B0017VG69U", "6305181721", "B00AZMFJYA", "B000HEWEJ4", "B00IWTVDUW", "B00005JLRT", "B002I9Z8I0", "B00023P4F6", "B000AOEMXM", "B000B5XOTS", "B00J9BZ4KC", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B000F8O2OW", "B000VDDDY6", "B000BZISS0", "B000BOH990", "B0025KVTLW", "B000CNE0TC", "B000T9OP7G", "B00JJRLFTU", "B004MYOXRQ", "B002I9Z8GW", "B004HYW84G", "B000EXDS34", "B000TLTCTK", "B00H83EUQW", "B00GTZWZH6", "B0002JJBZO", "B00404ME2E", "B000BOH98G", "B000EU1Q3Q", "B000BOH986", "B0002CX1M0", "B000CNESLW", "B000BT96FA", "B0009JE6G6", "B000BC8T1E", "B002GP7ZVO", "B00000ILBK", "B000IJ79WU", "B000CNE0T2", "B00CTSDDVO", "B000742FZW", "B000BW7QWW", "B002HWRYJE", "B0047P5FUY", "B001S86IZE", "B0007UDCX0", "B000ERVJJ0", "B005A1GRSI", "B00D9EJFZA", "B002L9N4E2", "B000HWZ4E8", "B00BN0WQ5I", "B0016MOWNM", "B00000ILDF", "0792841670", "B000F7CMQ8", "B000ERVJMC", "B000CNE0SS", "B008JFUS0U", "B00000ILDG", "B0090SI56Y", "B000RPCK1A", "B00BTJV9RO", "B002I9Z8EO", "B002JVWR4A", "B00E8AVN9U"], "bought_together": ["B00BHWG0DQ", "B00BHWG0CM"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000063V8U", "B000063V8S", "B000063V8R", "B000062XFG"]}, "price": 75.0, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 78545}, "asin": "B000063V8T", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51var5T2b6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Star Trek The Next Generation - The Complete Fifth Season"}
{"description": "If you want the full sledgehammer-to-the-stomach effect ofAudition, stop reading this review now. Just watch it and take the consequences. At first glance, Takashi Miike's jack in the box of a movie works like a romantic comedy: amiable widower Shigeharu Aoyama (Ryo Ishibashi) decides it's time to find a new wife, and a friend suggests holding a fake audition to find the right girl. It soon becomes clear that there is something wrong with Aoyama's choice. This is no ordinaryFatal Attraction-style thriller, however;Auditionslowly and carefully builds into a wrenching exploration of both deep male fears and the stereotype of the cute, submissive Japanese woman.Auditionis by no means an easy movie to watch--even hardcore horror fans may have trouble--but it will stay with you for a long, long time.--Ali Davis", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000CABGW", "B000GSYRY6", "B001MEJY8W", "B0000CC885", "B0009S2T0M", "B000GBEWNY", "B00125WATQ", "B00006FDBW", "B00005JNJR", "B001I82RVS", "B001VG2MAI", "B004P2VQZ2", "B000BGH2A4", "B000ARFPMQ", "B000CRR3ME", "B000GI3RHY", "B002P7UCJK", "B000GB5MOW", "B006L4MWVE", "B00009W0U4", "B003VL3UR0", "B00GGY4R3K", "B005SQRYB4", "B001570H5K", "B000S0GYRU", "B0028DRGDQ", "B000MM0LH8", "B0014VPFVS", "B002EOVXBK", "B000Q7ZKWU", "B0009OUBC4", "B004KDYR20", "B001B187L6", "B006L4MWTQ", "B0000AVHAO", "B000FS9FIA", "B000E0OE4O", "B000E3LGMY", "B00005K9O8", "B000088NQR", "B0007XBM8O", "B0082A3HFK", "B002OVO18A", "B0009KA2UO", "B001D5C1R6", "B000274TLW", "B008G1JIQC", "B000PKG8TW", "B0015ET3YO", "B000JU7JIW", "B000FVQYW2", "B000WC38EQ", "B0007WQHI0", "B004XQO8MS", "B003Y7F1IW", "B002E01MHY", "6305228876", "B000BVM240", "B0016K76V4", "B001JV5BIA", "B000FS9FE4", "B00DW5IM14", "B004H2CXBQ", "B003KGBISE", "B000NA28GG", "B003TRMLQM", "B00BSU0FQA", "B000S0GYRK", "B000FZEQWI", "B000CSTKHE", "B001FOK70S", "B0083H6B0U", "B001MFNB4O", "B000MMLP9G", "B001MYIXAC", "B008CYDD7I", "B000A2XA8M", "B000IMUYJM", "B0007GAG42", "B003UTPL2A", "B00187FPC2", "0783228457", "B000H0M4CK", "B000069I0A", "157362408X", "B004O63TWW", "B004ZKKKW4", "B000H5U5YO", "B000MEYKCI", "B00008WJCJ", "B006U49SC6", "B0009KQOZQ", "B001J710Y8", "B004XQO8LY", "B001G9CNI6", "B00006FMCS", "B00104AYG0", "B00006AUIG", "B000096I9V"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001MEJY8W", "B0000CABGW", "B006L4MWTQ", "B004P2VQZ2"]}, "price": 1.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 202588}, "asin": "B0000640S9", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5113YQFBZDL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Audition"}

{"description": "The new short film \"Scrat's Missing Adventure: Gone Nutty\" showcases the well-timed animation--strongly influenced by Chuck Jones's Road Runner-Wile E. Coyote shorts--that made that frantic little character so effective as a comic foil. It's interesting to compare the Oscar&#xAE;-winning short \"Bunny\" withIce Age. The viewer can see the Blue Sky artists developing the more angular and less detailed look that's become the studio's signature. Like Sid the Sloth, the title character in \"Bunny\" suggests a slightly frayed walk-around figure from a theme park; the texture of her coat anticipates the old-chenille-bathrobe look of Manny the Mammoth's pelt. The clips in different languages, trailers, directors' commentary, and making-of features feel rather standard, but listening to John Leguizamo experiment with different voices before settling on the exaggerated lisp for Sid offers an unusual and funny insight into the development of an animated character.--Charles Solomon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000GUJZ00", "B001GCUNWQ", "B005LAIISA", "B000MV9026", "B004HO6I4M", "B000AY74OG", "B001DPHDCY", "B002WJI2QQ", "B0006JMLRK", "B0012EM5D8", "B0000AOX0O", "B00CWM58WY", "B005QODEEE", "B0039N74CW", "B00005JNQS", "B00003CXJ4", "0783231474", "B001ECQ75A", "B00BG0RSJ4", "B0000640SC", "B001NCDFTW", "B004EPZ034", "B000M343BC", "B000RMJ4F8", "B0042U94UQ", "B00007LVCM", "B00AFEX83C", "B0000VV4W2", "B000UVKGPI", "B00005JMQZ", "B0013FSWT2", "B00G5G7EXY", "B008JFUQ16", "B002ZG97YM", "6305161887", "B0030IIZ4M", "B00005JNS0", "B0013FSL3E", "B005SDUV4E", "B00CHVJODE", "B00EBBGLFC", "B00EV1YZ96", "B001GCUO7A", "B005LAIHW2", "B00E9ZATJO", "B000056H26", "B00029LO0Y", "B000VBJEEG", "B006JD48LO", "B00F522C7C", "B005LAIH4A", "B003H9M1Q2", "B004G600A4", "B00005JM7T", "B005F96UJ6", "B00365F6I2", "B008YWY0HK", "B0030IIYYS", "B00JK531ES", "B00947N6D8", "B001OMU6UM", "B00GDT5T9Y", "B001ILFUD2", "B00000JL8E", "B000L22SG6", "B001GCUNW6", "B001KVZ6FW", "B00009YXAW", "B004LWZW7Y", "B001HN6918", "B003ZHVJGO", "B000065V42", "B00HLTD2OE", "B00275EHJG", "B00E00OGE2", "B00003CXB4", "B001HN6922", "B001U3D88M", "B002ZG9904", "B000H7JCK0", "B000AAF1TU", "B00005JMFH", "B001LPWGFA", "B008NNY9QW", "B009PPO78W", "B000LPS2VI", "B003E66Y84", "B00157OICI", "B003UESJF6", "B00003CXG7", "B001O5LVPI", "B000EQ5UHS", "B00028HBES", "B0000VCZKW", "B000ROAK2W", "B00ALMNCLQ", "B00I6JOD2S", "B000YERP2S", "B00CTNYLQA", "B00H5NY7NG"], "bought_together": ["B004HO6I4M"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004HO6I4M", "B005LAIISA", "B00IEXX4KS", "B000MV9026"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 126280}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 13.07, "brand": "20th Century Fox", "asin": "B00006CXHU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5150B79E6SL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Ice Age (2-Disc Special Edition)"}

{"description": "Toula is 30. And unmarried. Which means as a nice Greek girl -- she's a failure. All her cousins did the right thing -- married Greek boys and made Greek babies. So everyone worries: what will become of Toula? Then one day she sees the ultimate unattainable guy and realizes the only way her life will get better is if he gets away from her big, fat Greek family. Toula escapes from the family restaurant. She exchanges her seating hostess jacket for a college diploma, convinces her aunt to give her a new job, and trades in her coke-bottle glasses for contact lenses, just in time for \"him\" to walk back into her life.

{"description": "A relic certainly, but a fascinating one,Der Golemis perhaps the screen's first great monster movie. Though it was actually the third time director-star Paul Wegener had played the eponymous creation, the earlier efforts (sadly lost) were rough drafts for this elaborate dramatization of the Jewish legend.  When the Emperor decrees that the Jews of mediaeval Prague should be evicted from the ghetto, a mystical rabbi creates a clay giant and summons the demon Astaroth who breathes out in smoky letters the magic word that will animate the golem. Intended as a protector and avenger, the golem is twisted by the machinations of a lovelorn assistant and, like many a monster to come, runs riot, terrorizing guilty and innocent alike until a little girl innocently ends his rampage. Wegener's golem is an impressively solid figure, the Frankenstein monster with a slightly comical clay wig. The wonderfully grotesque Prague sets and the alchemical atmosphere remain potent.--Kim Newman", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001M9ELJY", "B00006JMQG", "B000VUQ4HW", "B00180R06I", "B00005O5CA", "B0040QYROA", "B00917IPOQ", "B00005RF2C", "B00006JMQI", "B000V3IXAA", "B000TEUSI6", "B00116VG2S", "B000FS9FLW", "B00007CVS6", "B0056ANHCC", "B001M9ELK8", "B00064AEXI", "B00917IPSW", "B00067HP9G", "B00065GX64", "B00EO2I6RO", "B0000B1A1J", "B00007CVS8", "B0001UZZS6", "B005D0RDKM", "B003TTZTC8", "B00064AEWY", "B000HT3QBO", "0780022343", "B0057O6II2", "B003MT2EK0", "B0083Q4JXM", "B00113ALKO", "B000FS9FLM", "B001CD6HQA", "B00005O5CF", "B00005QW59", "B0009X770E", "B00004Z4VE", "B008BWFOXM", "B000V7HFL4", "B0057O6IFU", "B00D9BNONW", "B0013K8J90", "B00000ILEU", "B0063E00HU", "B0001Y4MJA", "B0002V7O0Q", "1873982917", "B00BX49BGQ", "B0040QYROK", "B000SFJ4KE", "B00J2PQYY0", "B000V3IX82", "B00004W3HF", "B00005QW58", "B005FQ2H0A", "B00GFZLE2M", "B0029R81JO", "B00D9EJFZA", "B00AQ6J5YA", "630507559X", "B001BSBBIA", "B001BSBBIK", "B006TTC5J0", "B00005YJMX", "B000RPCJ9I", "B00AFQSZB0", "B00DZP1C9K", "B00D8HNRBG", "B00393SFU2", "B00HRUQ8X4", "B00019JR5Y", "B002945DUW", "B0081XAQNE", "0374327416", "B00GG0NABE", "0520257901", "B00005J75F", "B000A0GOF0", "B00EVU3SO0", "B009KG7F30", "B00I099JO6", "B00000F62P", "B0000694WH", "0393050882", "B000035Z3K", "B005HIBWBG", "B00005JKFR", "B000GRUQJW", "B000HD1MW0", "B0000DZTOV", "0671454838", "B005VU9LO0", "B002NTDX6O", "B004CNK53S", "B005ARYF1S", "6305869367", "B00005LC4L", "B0012KHTEC"], "bought_together": ["B00006JMQG", "B000VUQ4HW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000VUQ4HW", "B00005O5CA", "B00006JMQG", "B0040QYROA"]}, "price": 11.96, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 23004}, "asin": "B00006JMQH", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41NRY90QM0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Golem (Restored Authorized Edition)"}

{"description": "The third season of Joss Whedon'sBuffy the Vampire Slayerwas marked by the arrival in Sunnydale of renegade slayer Faith (Eliza Dushku), a moody loner who seemed to like her demon-staking calling just a littletoomuch. While Buffy (Sarah Michelle Gellar) was always wary of Faith, the two developed a deep friendship and appreciative rapport--that is, until the evil mayor of Sunnydale (Harry Groener) tapped into Faith's dark side and lured her into his plot to take over the world, first as a double agent spying on Buffy, then as out-and-out nemesis. And as the mayor's ascension approached--which happened to fall on Sunnydale High's graduation day--Buffy and Faith's battles got nastier and nastier, as Buffy attempted to wrestle with her dark side (literally and figuratively), save the world and her friends, and keep her lover Angel (David Boreanaz) out of Faith's evil clutches.Chock-full of exceptional episodes, this third season started out with a bang (the superb season opener \"Anne,\" in which a runaway Buffy finally returns to her Slayer calling) and never let up. Among other highlights, the season introduced former vengeance demon and soon-to-be regular Anya (Emma Caulfield), fleshed out Angel's tortured character (and readied him for his own series), and featured a hilarious doppelganger Willow (Alyson Hannigan), a vampire from a parallel universe, who in Willow's own words was \"evil and... skanky... and kinda gay!\" (Total foreshadowing there, folks.) The season's pi&#xE8;ce de r&#xE9;sistance, though, was the two-parter \"Graduation Day,\" wherein Faith tries to kill Angel, and the students of Sunnydale High prepare to do battle with a mutated mayor and his army of demons. Aside from the series' exceptional writing and acting, this compelling year ofBuffywas anchored by the consistently excellent Gellar, as well as Dushku's complicated Faith, a girl youtrulylove to hate. By the time you finish these episodes, Faith will have cast a spell on you that you'll find very hard to shake.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000EHSVLY", "B000EHSVL4", "B000EHSVM8", "B000EHSVKK", "B000EHSVMS", "B000EHSVN2", "B000I0QLQY", "B000I0QLR8", "B000I0QLRI", "B000I0QLRS", "B000I0QLS2", "B007H9CNOI", "B0006IUE16", "B000HD1482", "B0009W5J4Q", "B000B5XOW0", "B000CCBCGM", "B000ERVJM2", "B000GG4Y6O", "B000JLTRIG", "B000OIOPHC", "B003YF9Q08", "B00344EAQO", "B0000AQS0F", "1593078226", "B00466H3CW", "B005CM1IIE", "B00005JLKB", "1595821651", "B002JVWR4U", "B00JF5G8WU", "B006LG74Q0", "B0024FAR66", "B0001JXPPC", "B00J2T1856", "B00022FWEU", "B00006J3WH", "B0009JE6FC", "B00IKM5LXG", "B00001R3O1", "B000069I1I", "B000CNE0SS", "B000BNI90Y", "B001JAHRME", "1595826106", "B00AMDA2QC", "1442412097", "1595825584", "B00005Y1NF", "159307963X", "B0012Z36F8", "B000X5SPBI", "B003L77GAQ", "B000CNE0TC", "B00133QNS6", "B000EBGFPY", "B001FB4W0C", "B002U8XW9Q", "B001QE99AQ", "B000N6SE4U", "B003R4ZMN6", "0789326302", "B000BOH986", "B009LDCXNY", "B001M5UDGS", "1442412119", "B0018RKEQY", "B000NOKFH6", "B00511N79O", "B002BWP2IK", "B000MX7V66", "B000062XFG", "B00006FD9N", "B00JF5GAZA", "B00133QNSG", "B009LDCWWG", "B00133QNRW", "B000E5KQM8", "B000F3UAE8", "B000FL7CAK", "B000B8QFYG", "B003L77GWE", "B00EIL7E9C", "B00B1RB7TO", "B00191AEYQ", "B0030Y12AA", "B0011FLGZQ", "B000AJJNI6", "B001ILFUA0", "B001MVWRNE", "B000095ZGW", "B000RW3YYA", "B00K0D9760", "B00HEQOAIQ", "B000NA28I4", "B000LC4ZI0", "B000BOH98G", "B000AJJNFE", "B000O77SN6", "B00005JLYW"], "bought_together": ["B000EHSVLY", "B000EHSVM8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000EHSVL4", "B000EHSVKK", "B0046XG48O", "B000EHSVLY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 154783}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 32.59, "brand": "20th Century Fox", "asin": "B00006RCNX", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RSRJ6FCWL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Buffy the Vampire Slayer - The Complete Third Season"}
{"description": "What do you get when you cross the director ofI Know What You Did Last Summerwith Sylvester Stallone? You get a slasher film in which the victims are not screaming, scantily clad teens, but parka-clad cops. Whether that's an improvement on the genre is open for debate. WithEye See You(which never hit U.S. theaters but was released internationally asD-Tox), Stallone's career has officially \"Van-Dammed.\" But the role of FBI special agent Jake Malloy is something of a dramatic departure. Unable to catch a cop killer before he nastily dispatches his girlfriend (wouldn't you know; right before Jake was about to propose!), Jake takes to the bottle. He enters a snowbound rehab center for cops housed in the Wyoming mountains. The demons Jake must confront are not just psychological. A killer is stalking the residents one by one.

As long as you don't lean too hard on such niggling details as logic, legality, and the laws of physics, this silly, splashy, family bonding bulletfest is a spirited good time.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000BRBA9M", "B00096S49E", "0767802519", "B00000F527", "B00005NB9Y", "B0007KZQ9S", "B004AUP3K8", "B008JEJU5K", "B000VNMMPM", "B00GAJFILQ", "B000W44IZW", "B0000E32V2", "B003J7HO6E", "B00008ZZ9E", "B002O5M4SA", "B00GAJFIXO", "B000O76Q0M", "6305263248", "B000GPPPTK", "B001GF8WP8", "B001CIOCLC", "B00005OSLQ", "B0040QYRTA", "B000934FC2", "B006W4KWCE", "B00G3HOJZ6", "B00369ERCY", "B001RTKKRQ", "B0002XNSZ4", "B00022XE6S", "B008DL4KC2", "B000X1Z0C4", "B005ZMBEXU", "B000NAJC7Y", "B00000K3TS", "B006C1S1DY", "6305133476", "B007I1Q59E", "B008E70EES", "B000FWHW68", "B004H2CXBQ", "B00DU22OI6", "B00008EY6M", "B0019EXZY4", "B00195FUDC", "B000P0J0D8", "B000SSQ7JC", "B002DZKALY", "B0045NXMJE", "B001JV5BA8", "B00GB0ORSE", "B0000CABJX", "B004HO6HWA", "B0087DFIYA", "B001MEJY9G", "B000M5B6PG", "B00FFT19XS", "B000QGEB12", "B001QB9H10", "B006JTN5VM", "B00008CMRO", "B001U0HB5Q", "B0069UV0AY", "B0000CC885", "B00BM7AFKK", "B00F3TDA6O", "B002AG2NTI", "B00AEFXRRO", "B000ICLRIY", "B000K7VHNW", "B001APM44O", "B00AW8OZ88", "B007V9ED2E", "B000ELL1SA", "B005LAIILM", "B005OK0YNO", "B004ED52XE", "B009CSVQ8Q", "B000MRA542", "B00005RYKV", "0780618548", "B002LMV7RA", "0783229402", "B0002HOEPI", "B002GHHHJC", "B006L4MWVE", "B00003CY5A", "B0051HCVEU", "B00441GYRY", "B004ZBFRRG", "B005M2AKN8", "B001FU793A", "B0011VIO3M", "B0002YLEBI", "0767845722", "B004SEUIXS", "B000A2IPQY", "B0000AUHOK", "6305944288", "B00018D40O"], "bought_together": ["0767802519"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0767802519", "B00008ZZ9E", "B000VNMMPM", "B00CPTUNH4"]}, "price": 7.5, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 29478}, "asin": "B00007L4OM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/519QYXY9G1L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Wasabi"}
{"description": "Anchor Bay gives Just Jaeckin's legendary 1974 erotic dramaEmmanuellean appropriately sumptuous DVD presentation, featuring uncut prints of the original and its two official sequels, 1975'sEmmanuelle 2and 1977'sGoodbye Emmanuelle, in a three-disc set. All three films, which star Sylvia Kristel in the title role, are handsomely mounted adults-only fare, and their lush photography, exotic locations, and arousing (but not explicit) bedroom couplings not only helped to change softcore features, but also offered an alternative to XXX for mainstream audiences.Based on a memoir by the wife of a delegate to Thailand,Emmanuellefocuses on the sexual awakening of a naive French diplomat's spouse at the hands of an experienced older man (Alain Cuny). First-time director Jaeckin and producer Yves Rousset-Rouard eschewed going the pornographic route with the story, and instead concentrated on the natural beauty of the Thailand setting and their star, 20-year-old Dutch model Kristel. The film was a runaway success in Europe and America, where it was successfully promoted as an erotic film devoid of porn's misogynistic tendencies. In addition to its box-office impact,Emmanuelleencouraged other softcore filmmakers to showcase travelogue-style locations and less sniggering storylines.Emmanuelle's success naturally precipitated sequels, and two more adventures followed:Emmanuelle 2(subtitledThe Joys of a Womanin the States), which moved the action to Hong Kong; andGoodbye Emmanuelle, which sent the libertine to the Seychelles in search of a meaningful relationship. Respective directors Francis Giacobetti and Francois Leterrier's efforts were appropriately spicy, but Rousset-Rouard wisely decided to quit while he was ahead after the third picture. The series' worldwide appeal prompted a string of cheap and strange ripoffs, many featuring Indonesian actress Laura Gemser, who appears inEmmanuelle 2. But for cult movie fans, Anchor Bay's set offers the real Emmanuelle in all of her undraped glory.--Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["B003AILWYC", "B00094AS4A", "B0012R1R34", "B000TXPXAU", "B00F947QCW", "B00177Y9TS", "6305731977", "6305731969", "B00FB349R6", "B00K0MM4AM", "B00094AS04", "B002VD5SBA", "B00AKLLSNC", "B000059TO8", "B000NOK1L6", "B005JJCMOO", "B0012Z369O", "B0030VANHQ", "B000228SKU", "B006M3M5FM", "B001TR3NPW", "B002AS463W", "B000IJ7ANI", "B00817MQBK", "B000051ZN3", "B006Z7Z3VS", "B005K26YYO", "B0057IQXFG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000TXPXAU", "B000J3Q8U4", "B0012R1R34", "076782170X"]}, "price": 76.49, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 264639}, "asin": "B0000844JO", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41FKHTJRA6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Emmanuelle Collection (Emmanuelle / Emmanuelle 2 / Good-bye Emmanuelle)"}

{"description": "Uma Thurman is painful to watch inHysterical Blindness--and that's a compliment. Thurman completely gives herself over to her trashy character, a pathetically self-deluding good-time girl who hangs out in a tavern in Bayonne, New Jersey, circa 1987. She occupies the bar stool next to her best bud (a dead-on Juliette Lewis), willing herself to believe that an obviously indifferent pick-up is Mr. Right. Mira Nair (Monsoon Wedding) directed this familiar but nicely-rendered HBO production; her visual style, full of obscured sightlines and opaque glass, emphasizes the heroine's inability to see clearly. Gena Rowlands and Ben Gazzara, as Thurman's mom and her gentleman suitor, add an echo of Cassavetes realism. But it's Thurman's tour de force, capturing the kind of lost soul whose idea of first-date chat is to break an awkward silence by boasting about her best sexual skill. She will make you cringe.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JKJS", "B0000AYJV8", "0792846435", "B004YCKJSS", "B000JLQQ94", "B0000797IO", "B0002KPIQY", "B00AEFYD9K", "B000CS45TW", "B00029NLJQ", "B00005YUPJ", "B00005OBAL", "B00066FAZ8", "B00BTYPWFE", "B00077BOHO", "B0001NBMEY", "0767827740", "B00005JH9M", "B000CS45H4", "B004XVMCKS", "B00005JLFA", "B001UJUGZY", "B00006RCNY", "6305428409", "6305162018", "B0034G4P6W", "B00009MEC4", "B000U1ZV76", "B001OQ17RE", "B000JGWD5A", "B00002RAO2", "B005CFBZX4", "B000A2X46K", "B0000WN0SC", "B005VU9LO0", "B0019UGY96", "0790738511", "078322933X", "B00062IVM6", "B004SIP8WU", "B00366F2NU", "B00000F5MN", "B00005TPLW", "B000055Z4G", "B000QXDCLA", "B00006AW0I", "B004XVMCJE", "B0019EXZYE", "B00008EY9G", "B00001QGUM", "B000228EGS", "B0000639ET", "B000ECX0O2", "B000PAAJVU", "B0000TWN6K", "B000RGN2JI", "B000069HYG", "B0000CE684", "B001J9KJ48", "B000BB1MQO", "B001WAKFP2", "B00199PPP6", "B006YTGL86", "B0002TT0MI", "B00008K7AO", "B00029NLJG", "B00E8G5GU6", "B002OVED88", "B0000VV508", "B00008WI9N", "B00005LZOD", "B000T5O48K", "B0001GF2D8", "B000P0J0D8", "B0000JD29M", "B000NQRR34", "B00AEFYC96", "B000EBD9T4", "B00003CWN3", "B0002WT4OE", "B00B83OIVA", "B000BOH904", "B004P7CN5O", "B00005LOKR", "B001FB55L2", "B0029Z8K74", "B002AF4Y9G", "B000MMMTBY", "B000P0J0EM", "B004YOEDR4", "B000E33VWW", "B000065V3H", "B00606P0BM", "B00005JM23", "B000NO39FG", "B002AT8KAG", "B000A2UBN4", "B00002SSKI", "B00003CX8U", "B000EWBKMG"], "bought_together": ["B00005JKJS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B007NE08RG", "B00077BOHO", "B00AEFXX9Q"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 109243}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.33, "brand": "THURMAN,UMA", "asin": "B00008NNPH", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51SZDDRKC2L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Hysterical Blindness"}

{"description": "The second season ofAngelsaw the cult vampire show finally stand on its own fromBuffy the Vampire Slayer, assembling all the members of the show's core cast, transferring the action to a fashionably run-down L.A. hotel, and bringing in a fewBuffycharacters from Angel's history to further establish the moody vampire's own mythology. Moving their Angel Investigations to posher digs, Angel (David Boreanaz), Cordelia (Charisma Carpenter), and Wesley (Alexis Denisof) were soon joined by street fighter (J. August Richards)&#x96;-and by street fighter, of course we mean demon street fighter. But just as this group was solidifying, up popped Angel's old love, Darla (the fantastic Julie Benz), freshly arrived in L.A. from a hell dimension&#x85; just in time to be turned into a vampire again by her old cohort, Drusilla (Juliet Landau), and lure Angel into abandoning his newly formed team. It was the best and worst of times forAngelin its second year, for while the basis was being set for the show's stellar third and fourth seasons, dramatic tension was diluted by Angel's going solo and the necessary (but plot-debilitating) flashbacks to various points in Angel's history. However, just when it seemed everything was about to fly out the window,Angel's creative team threw its characters for a loop--literally--by transporting them to the demon dimension of Pylea, a medieval-style fantasyland populated by monsters and humans alike. It shouldn't have worked, as hokey as it was... but it did, thanks to crack storytelling, sharp dialogue, and the sheer joy the actors unleashed, especially the gifted and fiendishly funny Carpenter. The second half of the season also saw the addition of two ofAngel's best characters: the horned Lorne (Andy Hallett), a green demon with a penchant for karaoke, and Fred (Amy Acker), a physicist trapped in Pylea who helped the gang engineer their escape. With these two in tow,Angelbegan to soar. --Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000I0QLRI", "B000I0QLQY", "B000I0QLRS", "B000I0QLS2", "B000EHSVM8", "B000EHSVLY", "B000EHSVMS", "B000EHSVN2", "B000EHSVL4", "B000EHSVLE", "B000EHSVKK", "B0006IUE16", "B0009W5J4Q", "B0046XG48O", "B007H9CNOI", "B000B5XOW0", "B000CCBCGM", "B0024FAR66", "B000HD1482", "B000OIOPHC", "B00133QNSG", "B000JLTRIG", "B00006J3WH", "B000ERVJM2", "B0002XVKMM", "B000GG4Y6O", "B00133QNS6", "B000BOH990", "B000RO6JYK", "B00AMDA2QC", "B00IWTVDUW", "B000O77SMW", "B001B7CNZ6", "B000O77SN6", "B000HT3P60", "B00344EAQO", "B001992NWO", "B000GG4Y28", "B0000AQS0F", "1593078226", "B00466H3CW", "B000QDLSR0", "B009LDD4V4", "B002JVWR4U", "B009LDCXNY", "B0053O89IS", "B000BOH986", "B000GIW9GO", "B001L1S1OY", "B000BOH98G", "B00133QNRW", "B000CNE0SS", "B0013DZNAA", "B002N5N5MK", "B000FP2OPY", "B000X5SPBI", "B001MVWRNE", "B0024FAD9C", "1595826106", "B000T9OP7G", "B00129W6LE", "B000FIMG68", "B001FB4W0C", "B000NOKFGW", "B0041ONFJE", "B0009X76XW", "B003L77G8I", "B001MVWRNO", "B00008KA57", "B000F8O2Q0", "B000FL7CAK", "B00HUPC5X8", "B004R35DLW", "B000R7GKQE", "B002JVWRAO", "B000G75ARU", "B004YM6JI2", "B009LDCWWG", "B001QE99AQ", "B002JVWR4A", "B003L77GH4", "B003L77GGK", "B004X60QWO", "B001OQCVCY", "B0001JXPPC", "B003PGNBO8", "B00005JNOG", "B0085KGG96", "B00008KA5A", "B002CLKP00", "B006LG74Q0", "B002BWP2JO", "B0009ZE9Y4", "B00JF5GAZA", "B000AQN894", "B000R7I44K", "B002DLB1H0", "B0032JTV6A", "B002BWP2IK", "B004SMDJ9U"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000I0QLQY", "B000EHSVLY", "B000EHSVM8", "B000I0QLRI"]}, "price": 1.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 143420}, "asin": "B00008YGRT", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41D8962TGZL._SX300_.jpg", "title": "Angel - Season Two"}

Sheridan LeFanu's \"Carmilla\"), Pitt's sensuous bloodsucker seduces Hammer starlets Madeleine Smith and Kate O'Mara and incurs the vengeful wrath of Peter Cushing.Countessis the more sober of the two films, with Jeremy Paul's script and Peter Sadsy's direction playing out more like an Old Dark House mystery than Hammer horror, whileLovers' aims for comic-book thrills with plenty of nudity and violence (much of which was trimmed from the American version, but reinstated here); in both cases, Pitt's sexy/scary performances make this DVD a memorably viewing experience for vintage and new-school horror fans alike.--Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0009X770O", "B00B94VJYW", "B001B9ZVVC", "B001B1Q3LM", "B00005NSXY", "B0000A9GHP", "B00456VHMA", "B003M8NGG2", "B008HSK3PE", "B00000F62P", "B00009PY4D", "B00009PY4A", "B008BWFOXM", "B000RXVNCO", "B0002KQNJU", "B0034PWPHY", "B00ITZXDDY", "B000K7VL56", "B000062XEY", "B0000694WH", "B002WJHBEA", "B000TGJ89E", "B00005KHJO", "B000068TPF", "B0001FVE5O", "B00005NKTH", "1848562292", "B0016LFUVQ", "B000UDGOBG", "B000TUDBGG", "B0009X770E", "B0007R4T0S", "B000RXVNCY", "B00FUABJJQ", "B0007R4SZY", "B00005AUK0", "B0001CNRLQ", "B000AM6OOY", "B000EHSVJG", "B0030VO0DO", "B00JDOQMH4", "B0007R4T26", "B00009PY45", "B005CVFZ4I", "B0016KCCCC", "B003THSXJ6", "6305334730", "B00005LC4J", "B00D9EJFV4", "B00DOZNGC2", "B000XCK0OQ", "B005ZHBDTK", "B00006G8JZ", "B001BSBBNK", "B004X63SCY", "B000068TPE", "B004KDYR20", "B0001FVEAY", "B000060MVD", "B00005LC4N", "B00GRZPRB4", "B000067DCX", "6305808198", "B000GRUQJW", "B00008973G", "B00D9EJFZA", "B00IARA8HU", "B000068TPD", "B008N2Z16A", "B00006JMQH", "B007UQ8IQU", "B005D0RDKM", "B00005R1O7", "B00AGKH714", "B002945DUW", "B00006G8K0"], "bought_together": ["B001B1Q3LM"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00ITZXDDY", "B00B94VJYW", "B00005NSXY", "B003M8NGG2"]}, "price": 59.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 70046}, "asin": "B00009PY48", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZWB2BNT7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Countess Dracula / The Vampire Lovers"}

{"description": "Sooner or later, the Mystery, Inc. gang had to take on Mexico's legendary Bigfoot equivalent, El Chupacabra, and that's precisely what they do in this entertaining, feature-length, Scooby-style investigation into the paranormal. Taking the Mystery Van south of the border, Fred, Daphne, Velma, Shaggy, and Scooby-Doo celebrate Day of the Dead festivities, which become less festive when a towering, glowering Chupacabra monster turns up to terrify both tourists and locals. The young snoops smell a conspiracy, and as they chase down clues their search for the truth leads them into sundry Mexican antiquities--ancient tombs and temples--where danger increases exponentially. There are the usual rituals: Our time-warped heroes run like the wind during encounters with alleged ghouls--particularly best-buds Shaggy and Scooby, when they aren't stuffing themselves with delicious Scooby Snacks.

{"description": "The second season ofCSI: Crime Scene Investigationconsolidates the show's well-deserved popular appeal, while beginning to explore (gently at first) beneath the slickly professional surface of the investigators themselves. Gradually we learn more about what makes Grissom and his astonishingly gifted forensics team tick, beyond merely that they are workaholics who seem to require no sleep at all.  The show's trademark reveals of vital evidence--be it on the autopsy slab or under the microscope--add a fresh spin to what is, at heart, a good old-fashioned whodunit series. William Petersen brings the requisite air of antiquarianism to a character whose meticulous demeanor and love of order consciously inherits the mantle of Sherlock Holmes (whose vast collection of tobacco samples and bottles of chemicals are the ancestors ofCSI's high-tech crime lab). This is a series in which scientific evidence-gathering is elevated to the status of a religion. \"When a tree falls in the forest, even if no one is around to hear, itdoesmake a sound,\" affirms Grissom with the calm assurance of a yogi on the path to Enlightenment.And just whenCSIstarts to seem a littletoopat, just when the trail of clues seems a littletooneat, the show always seems able to throw a surprise or two at us: perhaps there has been no crime after all; perhaps the evidence concerns a completely different crime altogether; or perhaps, as in one brave episode concerning brothers implicated in multiple murders, the evidence simply isn't good enough to convict the right man, even when Grissom knows which one really is guilty. As a result, every episode is simply compulsive viewing.--Mark Walker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0001906X6", "B00008972G", "B0002NY8GW", "B000B8IA08", "B000H7JCGY", "B000UX6TIE", "B001CQONKY", "B001G0MFIS", "B003FSTN5M", "B003R0MEZO", "B0058YPJ8G", "B00915G6TE", "B001S86J3K", "B00064VQXA", "B000H7JCE6", "B000B5XOVQ", "B00020H9NO", "B000B8I9ZO", "B001G0MFLA", "B001BL6QE6", "B000SO7PCE", "B003FSTN6G", "B000H7JCEG", "B000UAE7QI", "B001BL6QDW", "B003FSTN5W", "B003R0MF0S", "B00BLN4V4G", "B000SQFC40", "B001G0MFL0", "B005PYL8VQ", "B000ION72Q", "B003R0MF08", "B008F283WW", "B00915G6OE", "B001AI776G", "B003R0MEZ4", "B005PYKVRI", "B000MGBSIK", "B000H7JCHS", "B000EWBNMI", "B000LE178Y", "B0058YPILY", "B0013DZNAA", "B003TFAJ18", "B002CLKV5Y", "B001G0MFKQ", "B009LDD4V4", "B005PYKNJY", "B000HT3P60", "B003UD7J26", "B000GA3LX2", "B000KGH00W", "B000TGJ8AS", "B0053O89IS", "B0002DRE72", "B00CYQXATG", "B00915G6SU", "B0019F02X0", "B003Q7B7B0", "B004UXVDOA", "B003FSTN5C", "B003L77G2E", "B000RO6JYK", "B001992NWO", "B00080Z5FM", "B003L77G8I", "B002C2KAS6", "B001F7Q4JS", "B00915G6MG", "B000FVQLIO", "B002JVWR4A", "B00EIXWMII", "B003R0MEXQ", "B00BQ7HNQA", "B00B9UEOPC", "B00GTZWUPS", "B00CYQXDNE", "B00915G6NK", "B002N5N4NA", "B001L1S1OY", "B000UO4F98", "B001QE99AQ", "B0018RKEQY", "B003WVJ65Y", "B001A4VH2U", "B00CYQXGAY", "B003UD7JC6", "B000G75ARU", "B00005JO3P", "B000N3T0EG", "B003L77G1K", "B000R9YLKY", "B00CP6YNGO", "B00CYQXFP0", "B002UXYCYA", "B00FR23QNE", "B0058YPI5K", "B003R4ZMPE"], "bought_together": ["B0001906X6", "B00008972G"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00008972G", "B0002NY8GW", "B0001906X6", "B000B8IA08"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 8061}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 12.98, "brand": "Paramount", "asin": "B0000A2ZNL", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51YWV6A966L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation: Season 2"}

{"description": "Star Trek: Voyagerbegan life in 1995 with some truly fascinating prospects in its two-hour pilot episode. Opening in the 24th century, a setting contemporary with that ofStar Trek: The Next GenerationandStar Trek: Deep Space Nineand carrying over story elements from each of those series, \"Caretaker\" finds Starfleet Captain Kathryn Janeway (Kate Mulgrew) stepping into the middle of Federation troubles with the Maquis, an army of rebels violently resisting the interplanetary organization's treaty with the brutal Cardassians. In the process, bothVoyagerand the Maquis ship under surveillance are accidentally catapulted out of the galaxy's Alpha Quadrant (the familiar stomping grounds of Starfleet personnel) by a benign but dying being called the Caretaker.Voyagerends up in the unexplored Delta Quadrant, some 70,000 light years away.So much seemed dramatically promising in this debut, especially the unwieldy alliance of Starfleet regulars and hostile Maquis, and the likelihood that a lifetime spent in isolation, trying to get home, would lead to the development of a self-contained society on the ship, yetVoyagernever entirely made up its mind what it was supposed to be about. The curiously cheesy sets and fascinating, progressive management style of Janeway (half mommy, half taskmaster) were also new developments inStar Trekculture. As the 16-episode season continued, character backstories were developed in such episodes as \"The Cloud\" (arguably the best episode of the season), \"Eye of the Needle\" (underscoring Janeway and the crew's sadness), \"State of Flux\" (in which a search for a traitor reveals a past romance between Commander Chakotay, played by Robert Beltran, and sexy Bajoran engineer Seska, played by Martha Hackett), and \"Jetrel\" (which explores the character of Neelix, the Talaxian played by Ethan Phillips, during a parable about scientific ethics and moral responsibility).Among other notable episodes, \"Phage\" strikes a nice balance among character development, story hook, and moral and emotional conflict when Neelix is literally robbed of his lungs by the Vidiians, a once-civilized people who are combating a deadly disease called the Phage by stealing organs. (The disease would return in \"Faces,\" a fine showcase for Roxann Biggs-Dawson as Chief Engineer B'Elanna Torres.) \"Emanations\" stirred controversy among the series' producers and some fans for its philosophical look at death, and \"Time and Again\" is a unique time-travel story in which Janeway and Tom Paris (Robert Duncan McNeill) get caught in a subspace fracture that places them just hours before they know a planet is going to be destroyed. In \"Prime Factors,\" latent tensions amongVoyagerpersonnel erupts into serious conflict, an issue revisited in the season finale, \"Learning Curve.\" Despite a pat ending that resolves the Maquis conflict much too easily, the episode drives home the fact thatVoyagerand its crew are all alone, making the most of a difficult predicament.--Tom Keogh and Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0001NBNFW", "B000228EBS", "B0002JP4GE", "B0002WZTCA", "B00062IDLA", "B00062IDCO", "B00005JLF5", "B0007TKH66", "B00008972H", "B00008KA57", "B0009I7NGW", "B00008KA59", "B00008KA58", "B00008KA5A", "B00008KGT0", "B000A6CLL0", "B00005Y1NF", "B00BHWG0DQ", "B00BHWG0CM", "B000AOEMXC", "B000063V8S", "B000063V8T", "B000063V8R", "B000062XFG", "B002HQKRBC", "B000CCBCIA", "B00062RCC6", "B000VDDDY6", "B001DHXT3Y", "B000RZIGVS", "B002I9Z8GM", "B000AOEMXM", "B00BHWG1AI", "B0017VG69U", "B002I9Z8I0", "B002BAW6FE", "B001DHXT6G", "B00AZMFJYA", "B000ERVJJ0", "B000F8O2Q0", "B000HEWEJ4", "B00HETWFVC", "B00JL6L4UY", "B00CYQXHLC", "B002BAW6GI", "B002BAW6FY", "B00FFEM0W2", "B00B7VZN76", "B00KB614HQ", "B002I9Z8EO", "B000JLTRHW", "B00GTZWZH6", "B00BD6K54G", "B000BOH986", "145166818X", "6305181721", "B000CSUNLQ", "B00CKYHH6O", "B00CTSDDVO", "B00HUPC5X8", "B0083TUEHY", "B003H9LIRK", "B000LC4ZI0", "B002I9Z8GW", "B0095XPZBC", "B00005B8UD", "B000B8IA2G", "B00062IDDS", "B000CNE0SS", "B002BAW6GS", "B00JK531ES", "B000BOH990", "B00BUDDMGU", "B001AII4RC", "B000SQFC2C", "B00GX7D5G0", "B001RHGRTS", "B00ENFS0F0", "B005XB8SHI", "B004EXWGHY", "B0019N95IK", "B00005JM3A", "B0089AD8IO", "B00061QJSK", "B00129W6LE", "B002BAW6H2", "B000AJJNFE", "B002GP7ZV4", "B000CQM4YM", "B000CNE0T2", "B000092T3Y", "6303961614", "B000EXDS34", "B0007UDCX0", "B00BAXTY8U", "B003ZFC9M4", "B001TH16DS", "B008JFUS0U", "B000HT3Q2I", "B00IF0KAYS"], "bought_together": ["B0001NBNFW", "B000228EBS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0001NBNFW", "B000228EBS", "B0002WZTCA", "B0007TKH66"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 32603}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 44.51, "brand": "Paramount", "asin": "B000127LW2", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Vm7E78f4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Star Trek Voyager - The Complete First Season"}

{"description": "It sounds likeLove Story, but with an intriguing twist. 23-year-old wife and mom Sarah Polley has spent her entire life sacrificing for others and living on the economic fringe; when she discovers she has only a few months to live, she resolves to keep the news secret. In her remaining time, she plots a course for various unfinished plans and deferred dreams:  write a journal, leave future messages for her kids, make a stranger (Mark Ruffalo) fall in love with her. Obviously, the danger of sentimentality lurks in director Isabel Coixet's concept, and the film does have a few soggy moments. Some critics lost patience with the main character's seeming selfishness (a good post-movie conversation starter). Yet there is something powerful in her insistence on claiming a small piece of existence exclusively for herself. Polley (Guinevere) gives a typically honest performance, with fine support by Scott Speedman and Deborah Harry.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000NJWIPI", "B000066JBR", "B000T5O48A", "B00005MKKV", "B008NA3I30", "B001QERPAC", "B0000844LU", "B00FXWAZW8", "B0002IQE2I", "0780622251", "B004QL7KKC", "B00AEFXESQ", "0767835093", "B00005T30L", "B004A8ZWV0", "B00000F7E6", "B00AKGG6JS", "B002K2KMJA", "B00DEKKEPO", "B0051GLDVS", "B00H9HZITU", "B0036TGSJE", "B00E8G5GU6", "B00003CWTI", "B00BLN4UDS", "B009AJB0YM", "B002AS463W", "B00005YUPC", "0767802519", "B001OQCV1K", "B006KH6CF4", "B0014D5RBE", "B004SIP6GI", "B00FRILRYS", "0800141806", "B003NKU9AK"], "bought_together": ["B000NJWIPI", "B000066JBR"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00A81MV3U", "B000NJWIPI", "B0000ZMGWK", "B00009MEJ6"]}, "price": 9.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 89272}, "asin": "B00013WWSY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51WK3YG5EFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "My Life Without Me"}
{"description": "Like the movie, the DVD extras are smarter and a lot more entertaining than your average flick. The making-of feature (\"Lessons Learned\") has the usual behind-the-scenes banter but Jack Black is in fine form--that is, something special--interviewing as much as being interviewed about the making of the film. His unique pitch to Led Zeppelin to use their song is alone worth the price of the DVD. Black is more his maniacal self and a bit more grating in MTV's Diary segment, but his commentary track with director Richard Linklater is as insightful as it is funny. Ok, it's a lot more funny, but entertaining throughout. The commentary track featuring just the kid actors is less so, but any preteen would love listening to it. To top it off, the DVD-ROM has Dewey Finn's instantly famous blackboard history of rock. You can drill down to the bands mentioned and get a brief history of each.

{"description": "No actor works harder to open a movie than Tom Cruise. His enthusiasm is throughout the DVD extras as he mirrors his samurai character by constantly talking about \"loyalty\" and \"discipline\" while working on the film. However as a post-movie experience, the top-line extras with Cruise and director Edward Zwick are repetitive and underwhelming, with too many clips from the film we assume DVD viewers have just seen. The History Channel show is also a pre-release promotional device that misses an opportunity to really dig into this intriguing time period. Better are segments on the costumes, the production design, and how you put together an Imperial army--in New Zealand, no less. Zwick's low-key and dense commentary (plus a \"Video Journal\") is not vital, but he illustrates many of the little peculiarities it took to make the wide-ranging film come together. There are two deleted scenes; a samurai's first appearance is particularly memorable.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEFY5B6", "B002O3Z50Q", "B00004XPPG", "B00AMSLDTM", "B0002YLCG0", "B0000DZTIW", "B000AARKOO", "B000QXDED6", "B003U0AHBO", "B00AEFXKUI", "B000A2WP7O", "B008MIMWOY", "B00AEBBA36", "B004AOECXI", "6305692688", "B000MGB6NM", "B0000TANUI", "079283366X", "B00005JL78", "B000W1SZBS", "B004SIP88Y", "B0034G4P58", "B001TUZG4K", "B00AS1Q93S", "B000MRA592", "B00001ZWUS", "B000E5N6LG", "B000XR9L50", "B0001HLVS2", "B00HEPDGKA", "B003ASLJO0", "B00AEBB9NM", "B000P0J0EW", "B0000A2ZNX", "B00005JNTI", "B0018QPPXW", "B000065U1N", "B000095WW8", "B0002WZTOI", "B002VWNIEA", "B004U7MQWY", "B002VWNID6", "B008JFUO36", "B00AEBB86A", "B00005JN0W", "B0007Q6VXC", "B001LRJH0U", "B000MZHW40", "B0002IQMAM", "B00004WG2F", "B003INBO3I", "B000EHRVMY", "B000NOKFHQ", "B000P0J0EM", "B00AEFXVCU", "B000YENUI6", "B000M341QE", "B0000YEEGM", "B001680M26", "B008R65XYC", "B002ZG99QS", "B00008K76U", "B000HRMAPE", "B007TBKAXK", "B00000G3PA", "0767810856", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B00AEFXYJA", "B002T9H2LA", "B000P0J0AG", "B00003CXZ1", "B000O599YO", "B000FS9FCG", "6304711905", "B00AEFXRRO", "B000HRMAUY", "B001ILHY1I", "B002NZK5V4", "B002VWNICC", "B000VKL6ZM", "B001UDS4BS", "B002ZG997C", "B004SIP8ZM", "0800177967", "B0001O3YD0", "B00005ATZT", "B004XFZ3UU", "B00004Z4WR", "B005LAIH2W", "B0007TKNGA", "B00000JQB5", "B0012Q732O", "B002ZG97RE", "B0002VEUV2", "0800141741", "B002ZG977Y", "B00005N5S3", "B00008G8M4", "B0000B1OFL"], "bought_together": ["B00AEFY5B6", "B00004XPPG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000QXDED6", "B00BEJL6JK", "B00AEFXXMI", "B00JU949TK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 121880}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 17.25, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B0001JXOUS", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51EdSWs9r9L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Last Samurai (Full Screen Edition)"}

{"description": "Allowing for all the low-budget shortcomings that plague any straight-to-video production,Starship Troopers 2: Hero of the Federationserves up 92 minutes of passable sci-fi action. Parlaying his veteran status as an animator, special-effects wizard, and stalwart survivor of the CGI revolution, Phil Tippett (with returning screenwriter Ed Neumeier) makes a woefully uninspired directorial debut with this makeshift sequel to Paul Verhoeven's 1997blockbuster, retaining the jarhead militarism of Robert Heinlein's original novel while serving up more bugs, an all-new cast of attractive young stars, and all-too-familiar plot elements borrowed from a dozen better movies. \"Bigger is better\" is out of the question under such meager budgetary circumstances, so Tippett and Neumeier compensate with gruesome bugfights and gross-out effects at regular intervals, some standard-issue nudity, and escalating paranoia (echoing Carpenter'sThe Thing) when a new breed of bugs use human hosts (&agrave; laThe Hidden) to overtake a stranded platoon of Federation soldiers on a bug-infested planet. Relying on murky confinement to hide nondescript sets,Troopers 2has three engaging leads in its favor: TV regular Richard Burgi is solidly cast as the titular hero (he's the military equivalent ofPitch Black's Riddick); Colleen Porch is engaging as the most sensible Federation survivor; and screen veteran Ed Lauter makes the most of his salty role as a battle-hardened general. Unfortunately, they're adrift in a knock-off sequel (shot on high-def digital video) that could never do justice to its energetic predecessor.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0018CWWA0", "B000OVLBHG", "B0088X7YMS", "B0018CWW9Q", "B0088X7YU0", "B000UAFDP2", "B00D3LA7G0", "B005TK0MFE", "B0009I8QI6", "B001AV3BYK", "B0001XAOKC", "B009MO57H6", "B001I9XOQO", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B00IKM5LXG", "B00AG51V8E", "B00D2ZF24O", "B00AEFY6PQ", "B00005OSJQ", "B00000ILDF", "B005LAIHPE", "1558908846", "B001HN697M", "B002ZG98UA", "B00AEFXCLU", "B002NXSRVG", "B00GBHNP7G", "B00005N5S5", "B00003CY6P", "B008OR5X4O", "B00BUAEYVK", "B005GYXO30", "B00JA3RVG4", "B008E70EES", "B00000IREA", "B005CHV14A", "B0006SGYL0", "B008JFUNHI", "B005LAIHXQ", "B001KMB6X2", "B000CNER1S", "B00005V1WW", "6304936532", "B0034G4ORC", "B0000AFX64", "B005LAII44", "B0029WLJHK", "B000QUCRB4", "B008JFUPFI", "B00HLTD3ZW", "B009YQJ322", "B001451HX4", "B00000ILDG", "B00003CXZ1", "B0090SI56Y", "B001CC7PLM", "0792839722", "B00AEFYGBA", "B005LAII3A", "B002U6CJCO", "B0045HCJ9O", "B005OK721G", "B005LAIIMG", "B009HIKAN8", "B00195FUDW", "B0016I0AKU", "B0087OULG4", "B00HEPDGKA", "B0047S4USO", "B004EPZ08O", "B00E8AVNAE", "B00A2H9OSK", "B009WGYXIS", "B00005R1O8", "B00003CY5D", "B007C4ZJ0S", "B001MTYRKC", "B00CFA222M", "B008JFUO36", "B00070FX5U", "B000FGGE68", "B005LAIGW8", "B000KX0HIW", "B00A34LX9A", "B0000AOX0F", "B008JFUN50", "B0001VTPWC", "B000SM6FLI", "B0073U2FB2", "B00AZMFJYA", "B000056HP6", "B00BEIYHT2", "B008JFURII", "B003Y5H5EW", "B004EPYZSK", "B00022XE6S", "B0002S94CK", "B007ZC31R0", "0767834739", "1451689012"], "bought_together": ["B0018CWWA0", "B000OVLBHG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000OVLBHG", "B0018CWW9G", "B0018CWWA0", "B0088X7YMS"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 133578}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.13, "brand": "Columbia/Tristar Studios", "asin": "B0001XAOQ6", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RKH5Q1C7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Starship Troopers 2 - Hero of the Federation"}
{"description": "\"Keep it real\" says Ali G (Sacha Baron Cohen) at the top of each show. Keeping it real is what the British comedian does--and doesn't do--during each episode. First, there's the character of Ali G himself. There's nothing real about this slang-slinging geezer. He's a poser, a white hip-hop wannabe from the 'burbs who aspires to be \"gangsta\" like Biggie and Tupac. His interview subjects, on the other hand, are the real deal: Newt Gingrich, Buzz Aldrin, Donald Trump, etc. Ali asks stupid questions, they attempt to provide intelligent answers. The humor comes from the disconnect between the two, which is to say:60 MinutesmeetsIn Living Color.Da Ali G Showwas a hit in Britain before Cohen brought his act to the States, but Ali wasn't the only character who came with him. There's also Borat, a Kazakhstan TV reporter with a shaky command of English. His show-within-a-show is called \"Borat's Guide to America\" and he travels the \"US and A\" interviewing regular folks, such as matchmakers and rodeo riders. Then there's Bruno, a sexually ambiguous fashion reporter with \"Funkyzeit Mit Bruno.\" His subjects include models and designers. Borat and Bruno have their moments, but Ali G is the star of the show and gets the most screen time. It's Ali G, after all, who gets both James Lipton and Ralph Nader to rap. (The verdict? Lipton's got skills; Nader should stick to politics.) As proof of his popularity in the U.K., Ali G got his own theatrical release,Ali G Indahousein 2002. As proof of his popularity in the U.S., HBO renewed his show for a second season. Due to sexual content, raunchy humor, and drug content,Da Ali G Showis recommended for mature audiences.--Kathleen C.

Virtually unrecognizable from his days onIn Living Color, a buffed-up, dreadlocked Foxx gives an effectively low-key performance, while Whitfield also shines in a less rewarding role.Redemptionmay not have the grandeur ofMalcolm XorThe Hurricane--and Tookie's transformation from man of violence to man of peace happens too quickly--but his story is just as inspirational.--Kathleen C.

{"description": "Federico Fellini's breakthrough film, the 1953I Vitelloni, is one of the cinema's seminal stories about slacker males, and a highly entertaining one at that. Following the unfortunate failure of his comedyThe White Sheik, Fellini prepared to shootLa Strada(he would release that early masterpiece in 1954), but decided at the last minute to make an autobiographical feature about mischievous, drifting, 30-ish losers in a small, seaside town.I Vitelloniclicked with international audiences and remains an obvious influence on such later classics asBreaking AwayandDiner. But there's nothing like Fellini's almost self-mocking fusion of gritty neo-realism with the audacious, illusionary style he would later be entirely linked. The ensemble comedy follows the ever-diminishing fortunes of five young men who can't define, let alone jump-start, their dreams, particularly the caddish Fausto (Franco Fabrizi), who thinks nothing of molesting the wife of his father-in-law's best friend.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001LMU1C8", "B000G8NXYQ", "B00000IOKV", "B00005V6N6", "B00005JKGO", "6305081034", "B00005QAPH", "B00009ME9Z", "B00005BHW6", "B00008H2GS", "B000059H9B", "0780022270", "B0007M222A", "B002U6DVQ2", "B004D8P24E", "B004ODLUIU", "B006MHZ32K", "B001WLMOOG", "B000059H9C", "B000JYW5AU", "B004M66YUS", "B0009HLCTC", "B00L3ZB7JO", "B00005BCJZ", "B0007989Y8", "B00DZP1BUU", "B000093NR1", "B005STRKQK", "B003VA3JTK", "B00JPUUSEE", "6305908486", "B00KE3B6NI", "B00HRJVHEK", "B004CGUC06", "B006MHZ46A", "B00598OA2C", "B000I0RNV6", "B0012KOM6K", "B00KE3B6LA", "B000AQKUG8", "B0011U3OA6", "B004R4PWYY", "B00012L786", "B00KE3B6LU", "B001NH4CIA", "B000BC8SWO", "B0006Z2NB8", "B002U6DVQM", "6305257450", "B00152VXUI", "B00HE010QM", "B000CR8QV6", "B0000633SD", "B004N084S8", "B00005JLMU", "B00782O7LG", "B003VA3JTA", "B0001ZIVAA", "B0007989ZC", "B00DZP1C3Q", "B004P0IRHE", "B000FUF7D0", "B0000BUZKP", "B004CIIXDC", "B00005NC66", "B000E3L7L4", "B00003CXUM", "B001BEK8BU", "B000BR6QCS", "B001LMU19G", "B000C8Q900", "B000093NR2", "B004OOL73W", "B00GBT637S", "B00F98FOFY", "B00J2PQZRQ", "B0000YEEHG", "B004WPYO7E", "B00HVOFP62", "B000093NR0", "B00J2PQYY0", "B00005JLV7", "B001WLMOLE", "B000IHYXH6", "B0000D0YVM", "B00IGK6TOM", "B001BSBBIK", "B000EOTWIS", "B00DHN8GGW", "B005152CB4", "B00EO2I6W4", "B005152C7S", "B00F98FOI6", "B00005UQ7Q", "B005KQVE1S", "B000BC8SWE", "B008A1AKK6", "B00HVOFP6W", "B005152CBE", "B003ICZW8M"], "bought_together": ["B001LMU1C8", "6305081034"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00598OA2C", "B00005V6N6", "B001LMU1C8", "6305081034"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 53302}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 20.83, "brand": "INTERLENGHI,FRANCO", "asin": "B0002DB4YQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51TAaC4yvTL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "I Vitelloni (The Criterion Collection)"}
{"description": "After one episode ofThe Wireyou'll be hooked. After three, you'll be astonished by the precision of its storytelling. After viewing all 13 episodes of the HBO series' remarkable first season, you'll be cheering a bona-fide American masterpiece. Series creator David Simon was a veteran crime reporter fromThe Baltimore Sunwho cowrote thebookthat inspired TV'sHomicide, and cowriter Ed Burns was a Baltimore cop, lending impeccable street-cred to an inner-city Baltimore saga (and companion piece toThe Corner) that Simon aptly describes as \"a visual novel\" and \"a treatise on institutions and individuals\" as opposed to a conventional good-vs.-evil police procedural. Owing a creative debt to the novels of Richard Price (especiallyClockers), the series opens as maverick Detective Jimmy McNulty (Dominic West, in a star-making role) is tapping into a vast network of drugs and death around southwest Baltimore's deteriorating housing projects. With a mandate to get results ASAP, a haphazard team is assembled to join McNulty's increasingly complex investigation, built upon countless hours of electronic surveillance.The show's split-perspective plotting is so richly layered, so breathtakingly authentic and based on finely drawn characters brought to life by a perfect ensemble cast, that it defies concise description. Simon, Burns, and their cowriters control every intricate aspect of the unfolding epic; directors are top-drawer (including Clark Johnson, helmer ofThe Shield's finest episodes), but they are servants to the story, resulting in a TV series like no other: unpredictable, complicated, and demanding the viewer's rapt attention,The Wireis \"an angry show\" (in Simon's words) that refuses to comfort with easy answers to deep-rooted societal problems. Moral gray zones proliferate in a universe where ruthless killers have a logical code, and where the cops are just as ambiguous as their targets. That ambiguity extends to the ending as well; season 1 leaves several issues unresolved, leaving you begging for the even more impressive developments that await in season 2.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0006IUD9Y", "B000FTCLSU", "B000QXDJLI", "B00123BY6S", "B004YOEDR4", "B00316DDYA", "B00005Y6YJ", "B00003CXOP", "B003Y5HWJU", "B001DJLCRC", "B005SEDI5M", "B00BC5I6Q2", "B00J5LXT44", "B0000Y40PW", "B00HUCF420", "B00000FBH2", "B0060MYKYY", "B0012CJQY6", "B00EEDNR9A", "B002AMUDK8", "B001RTSPVY", "0802144993", "B00HW3EXCE", "B0058YPG1G", "B00BVMXBDO", "B00031TYBC", "B00KHWSD1O", "B00FCOTRV2", "B001DW2BFQ", "B0032UYFA6", "B00HGE90Z4", "B000G1R4TS", "B00ECGHM5O", "B0055CP9UY", "B0012CJQYG", "B000NA1VI2", "B0038M2APA", "B0012CJQYQ", "B009LDCZ7I", "B0009GV9E6", "B0060MYM3S", "B0009K7RMA", "B00FEP9MYG", "B0015TX2LO", "B0011VJRVU", "B00ECHBSP8", "B0047H7QD6", "B00B5J6A7W", "B0020TS5EM", "B009VXVMAO", "B004YM6JVO", "B00C8CQRQ4", "B00HUCF7AO", "B001IBIDLI", "B000BO7DWI", "B000KLQUUS", "B004TJ1GY2", "B00FGEO9NE", "B00DJYJRHG", "B0019LY5IM", "B008CLI4N4", "B00I9MS86O", "B00C888LOO", "B00007KLE8", "B0094UOI64", "B004X1VUNI", "B001AQO3WY", "B00DNR3FN6", "B0038M2AQ4", "B002BLNGTS", "B004132HZS", "B00BNH9NCU", "B00BGI076M", "B00BUUAV08", "B00HOGBXS6", "B004HW7JO2", "B00BTRKMNI", "B00BC5FN2C", "B00000I73E", "B000FP2OPY", "B002CPMB9O", "B00CWIMVDW", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B000YABIQ6", "B005DVIOIG", "B00EIXWW2O", "B00HUCF6KK", "B0007YMVWO", "B00G4Q3KOC", "B00DW5IKN4", "B00AB55BS0", "B000P0J09M", "B001IBIHQ4", "B00AEFYG3S", "B001GCUER0", "B003EYVXTG", "B00005JNOG", "B000MGBSE4", "B00H7LJ2UO", "B00CDTSFF8"], "bought_together": ["B0006IUD9Y", "B000FTCLSU"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005NFJAWG", "B0006IUD9Y", "B00BC5I6Q2", "B001DJLCRC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 3788}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 22.99, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B0002ERXC2", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/511fyhhxpWL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Wire: Season 1"}

{"description": "Based on a comic book, the international co-productionRenegade(original English-language title:Blueberry) is a feverish, supernatural Western about a young Cajun man, Mike Blueberry (Hugh O'Connor), who defends his prostitute-girlfriend against gunman Wallace Blount (Michael Madsen) and ends up barely alive. Patched up by Indians, Blueberry undergoes the familiar cultural transformation to honorary Native American, then returns to his world to become a small-town marshal. (Vincent Cassel plays the adult Blueberry.) The arrival of Blount, possessed with otherworldly powers and seeking a mystical manuscript, sets the stage for a spooky duel that forces Blueberry to face old demons. The latter part of the film is overtaken by computer-generated effects that grow wearying, but before that director Jan Kounen makes up for weak narrative skills with mesmerizing imagery of the American Southwest. A nice supporting cast includes Juliette Lewis and her father, Geoffrey Lewis, plus Colm Meaney, Eddie Izzard, Ernest Borgnine, and Tcheky Karyo.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["161125003X", "B00000JSJC", "B004DME5NY", "B0045HCJSU", "B003YOZNBU", "B00005JPAR", "B00GRZPRB4", "B0048LPRCS", "B00F3TDA6O", "B000GIW9I2", "1620551934", "1583948163", "159477224X", "B00J49R1BY", "B00005LMAL", "B00JJ3EHCG", "B004SUDQ72", "B00EMAGKNU", "B00D3DJIG8", "B000NY1E94", "B000K7VHNW", "B00132D7Y0", "B003Z8ZC2A", "B003TRMLQM", "B00007L4OM", "B008NA3I30", "B004UA8D14", "B006OALDLA", "B000M5B6PG", "B004KDYQYY", "1594773459", "B001TK80D4", "B00006ADEM", "1559391014", "B000EOTUSU", "B004Z0QYY2", "B003M8NGQM", "0767817729", "0892819790", "B00D3DJI3Q", "0871355698", "B0020LH8WU", "0878396365", "B003Y5H4R0", "6304698747", "B004P7CMOQ", "B004499LX0", "B00CHMBQM0", "0671213997", "0671865412", "B00AEFYYP8", "1594771189", "0892815191", "B002Q3MZXE", "B001LRJH0U", "B00DU22OI6", "B005NGKMOU", "B000L6S92E", "B0055VF0B8", "6305127654", "B0056OZI0W", "B000YENUI6", "0932551068", "B004P2VQZC", "B006LL3W0W", "B0007OY2OE", "B00022XE6S", "B007X4ECMI", "0874779642", "B0050ODZ6M", "B00D5XC8PE", "B009POCG0Y", "B000MGB6NM", "B000QUCRB4", "B006Z7Z3VS", "1780361904", "B0041KKYCY", "B004XQO8MS", "B000FUH38C", "B0006TPE4C", "B001JFZ118", "B00005JM23", "B000O59A0C", "B009HIKAN8", "B002GOAH1A", "B002WJHDJI", "B00002CGGH", "B003EYVXXW", "B00005YU1O", "B00AEFY9YY", "B00BNWWVFG", "B00005JKLZ", "B009ERK2UI", "B000EHSVB4", "6305065551", "B00003CXRM"], "bought_together": ["B00000JSJC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00000JSJC", "B00CS7GYF8", "6305504024", "B004AOECXI"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 27940}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.49, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B0002XNSZ4", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516QC6KZ3HL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Renegade"}

{"description": "Forty years after the Cylon Wars, humanity's deadliest enemies have reemerged with a vengeance. In a sudden, devastating nuclear attack, the Cylon robots - who have now taken human form - wipe out billions of people. Only a handful of Colonial forces are left to shepherd the few survivors to safety. Commander William Adama (Edward James Olmos), the highest-ranking military officer left alive, reactivates the Battlestar Galactica to once again face humanity's greatest nemeses. Outnumbered and outarmed, Adama reluctantly concedes that the newly sworn-in President Laura Roslin (Mary McDonnell) is correct - this battle was lost before it had begun. With no choice but to flee, the ragtag fleet of survivors and humanity's only hope set out in search of the mythic 13th Colony of Kobol&#x2026; a legendary planet known as Earth.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000V5IP6K", "B002HRF68A", "B000BNI90Y", "B00129W6LE", "B001HUWQEA", "B002ZCY872", "B00A3717C0", "B001RTCP1U", "B0000AFX64", "B00466H3A4", "B0036EH3UC", "B00C7MW5SE", "B0026RHR6U", "B000W4KT9G", "B002HRF7AW", "B001993Y2M", "B002PXJRR2", "B0036EH3U2", "B003RR991Y", "B00A3718IS", "B002JE43O4", "B00344EAFK", "B0051GOB2G", "B000PHX8RA", "B002BAW6FE", "B0000UJL96", "B00402FGE4", "B002BAW6GI", "B0006FO9B0", "B004TJ1H3C", "B00CWX1HPA", "B004EXWGHY", "B00061QJSK", "B0012IXBNC", "B003PGNBO8", "B002BAW6FY", "B0012IX35S", "B00K8HALVI", "B00005B8UD", "B000067FP2", "B00HUPC5X8", "B000CEXFYW", "B0000AQS0F", "B00K8HAKSW", "B00AZMFJYA", "B000E5N6B6", "B0009Q0F5U", "B000FJH5M2", "B003H9LIRK", "B000EOTV98", "B002I9Z8AS", "B00J49R0ZQ", "B000FOPPBA", "B00005JKHP", "B000BOH8Y6", "B000UZ4C4A", "B000JLTRHW", "B00IWTVDUW", "B00F4FFO8E", "B002BAW6GS", "B00023BKMC", "B003H9LIYS", "B00BHLTIXQ", "B000N3T0EG", "B000BCCAEQ", "B002GP7ZV4", "B000YGHC0G", "B000ELL1QC", "B0013GS3WW", "B0002MHDW4", "B000WLU5ZM", "B000HEWEJ4", "B002BAW6H2", "B000QUEQ4U", "B002BVYBJW", "B003W5C0TY", "B001B7CNZ6", "B002U0KHME", "B004HYW84G", "B000E991A2", "B001MT7ZIS", "B00BUWD7WA", "B00B04NIZO", "B0028ERCMU", "B002OKK2AW", "B00003CXZ1", "B00GTZWZH6", "B00DB97LRC", "B0024FAD9C", "B007AFS118", "B000BW7QWW", "B00F3L8P26", "B00AEFYGBA", "B00BGI086Q", "B002U0KHNS", "B00022FWEU", "B007AFC0W4", "B006MFQ4OS"], "bought_together": ["B000V5IP6K", "B002HRF68A"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00A3717C0", "B0036EH3UC", "B002HRF68A", "B000BNI90Y"]}, "price": 10.17, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 58080}, "asin": "B00064AFBE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51PE4TY9CXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Battlestar Galactica (2003 Miniseries)"}

{"description": "Though theAustin City Limitsseries often spotlights Texas talent, this 2003 taping finds New England blueswoman Susan Tedeschi making herself right at home. LikeBonnie Raitta few decades earlier, Tedeschi extends her musical inclinations beyond blues purism, sampling from the songbooks ofSly Stone(\"You Can Make It If You Try\"),Bob Dylan(\"Don't Think Twice, It's All Right\"),Stevie Wonder(\"Love's in Need of Love Today\"), andJohn Prine(\"Angel from Montgomery,\" also a signature tune for Raitt) in addition to the more straightforward blues ofKoko Taylor(\"Voodoo Woman\"). Though Tedeschi's stinging lead guitar provides the focus, she receives strong support from a band featuring the interplay of electric pianist Jason Crosby (who doubles on violin) and William Green on Hammond B-3 organ. Highlights include a tribute to jam-band inspirationCol. Bruce Hamptonon \"Hampmotized\" and the simmering \"Wait for Me,\" with its echoes ofAretha Franklin. Tedeschi has yet to show the suppleness as a vocalist to complement her guitar chops, but the musical range she displays here bodes well for her artistic development.--Don McLeese", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000FVGNPA", "B007KDFWRG", "B004FRVE18", "B004RSCWZ2", "B001E2PTJK", "B00ILAWJLO", "B000ASATP8", "B00CFYAT6O", "B00772M1QA", "B00FLDG52I", "B000B9EYJS", "B000003A1E", "B002LMOCCC", "B00FLDG5BE", "B00IK7NC9G", "157330087X", "B00HQI823Q", "B0002HVE3I", "B00I5NKPWC", "B0009H1CJM", "B00I0TFR9C", "B00IPL286U", "B00081928M", "B000VR824S", "B0000A02WW", "157330056X", "B003VB5E2E", "B006QS9NG2", "B001KL3GWM", "B00064VKYK", "B0018M6J72", "B00DNJ99F2", "B00IF6WRBG", "B00I5NKP7W", "B003XMKMTQ", "B00EL6NWQI", "6305019681", "B00428CPUY", "B00006NSIP", "B00JFBCDD2", "B00HQI7VMY", "B0002CTSY0", "B0006UYOII", "B000654YRY", "B001R0KH3M", "B002L5GQGY", "B00IPL2BCQ", "B00BFBWY66", "B000641Z90", "B00HNTUR1S", "B001NP8PQM", "B00EYQ6IBQ", "B001EBEBOA", "B001CT05KI", "B0009WFFS6", "B00EL6NWWW", "B00EL6NWEA", "B000BTC5LW", "B000BM7U82", "B00006SFLX", "B00B7IJCZS", "B001F3ESG8", "B0074JODP8", "B001NP8PRG", "B0000UQQTE", "B00DC3DGSK", "B000B9EYKM", "B00JAD6DLS", "B009GB97L2", "B00FROW57K", "B00064VR0W", "B000G7PO7G", "B000WCDI64", "B000G7P854", "B005MXQD0G", "B003FPPE1W", "B009DT9ANW", "B00DB2JQ7W", "B003PBYT62", "B00003CXB1", "B00078RPGW", "B00HUQC3U2", "B006T8KT6M", "B0000DZEE3", "B000JBXHWI", "B00005U122", "B000I0QLUA", "B00GDBBW3E", "6304498969", "B000002L3P", "B00001X58X", "B00EL6NWB8", "B008B3MZMY", "6305610460", "B0002SPPSC", "B00005QBZD", "B000053VAC", "B001F9FHF8", "B00377V6J2", "B000I0QKDS"], "bought_together": ["B000FVGNPA", "B007KDFWRG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00CFYAT6O", "B006QS9NG2", "B007KDFWRG", "B004RSCWZ2"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 148418}, "categories": [["CDs & Vinyl", "Blues", "Contemporary Blues"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Blues", "Electric Blues"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Blues", "Modern Blues"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Pop", "Singer-Songwriters"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Pop", "Vocal Pop"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Rock", "Roots Rock"], ["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 12.97, "brand": "PBS", "asin": "B00064VQYO", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/416P6E2xX9L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Susan Tedeschi - Live from Austin, TX"}

{"description": "One nonfiction film that truly creates a narrative journey,My Architectis filmmaker Nathaniel Kahn's engrossing search for his father. Louis Kahn, one of the most celebrated architects of the 20th century, died in 1974 and left behind a highly compartmentalized life, including two children born out of wedlock to two mistresses. Nathaniel interviews the members of this somewhat puzzled family, but his deepest experiences are visits to the buildings that his father made (such as the grand Salk Institute in La Jolla, California), culminating in an emotional trip to Bangladesh. Here, Louis Kahn designed a massive government complex, a soaring achievement (and fascinating paradox--a Muslim capital designed by a Jewish man). This film asks:  where does an artist truly live? In his life, or in the work he leaves behind? Nathaniel Kahn takes an amazingly even-tempered approach to this, given his personal stake in the story, and the result is a uniquely stirring movie.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000GFRI6I", "B000BITUH0", "B007IKRV6G", "B005YFGJ8S", "B004RV719G", "B00366BBS0", "B005LVO6QC", "B00366BBU8", "B000VWEFP8", "B00008PHD1", "B007AQ1LE6", "B0060O0OJW", "B002KLALEC", "B0017ZBLLE", "0300171188", "B003XYL77K", "159030604X", "B000A5N4KI", "0393731138", "B000VBISSO", "B001UUBR9C", "B00GNDUTX6", "B004H0ZH84", "B0077QPPDC", "B00443FMIE", "0714849715", "B004CJQVQC", "B0011U3OAG", "B00B1E6DQO", "3931936929", "0789300990", "B007WXBGLK", "0300179405", "B0001V6ZIY", "B002RB56WM", "B001957A3K", "B009B8YZ8U", "B007AQ1LGO", "B002NWRMO0", "B000EHQWOW", "B000068OCS", "0807615439", "B001IZNIV4", "B0002JL9N6", "B007UW9WOQ", "B00F2OBD64", "B000HWZ4A2", "3822836516", "3822835358", "3836530686", "3822836435", "B003AWEZ74", "0870702823", "B00470MG06", "B0000SXK0Y", "1616890932", "6305943877", "156898149X", "B00DL48BM6", "B003SF4G68", "B000296E7W", "B00DEKKEPO", "0393731650", "B001KVZ6AM", "B000NQRE3C", "B000XECFXS", "B00AZMFM3I", "3822848956", "6305132917", "0847839443", "B00005O06J", "0292758456", "B000AS4L16", "B003GC4816", "B0013B34YE", "3836541068", "B0009X7BHI", "B008JFUTT0", "0486213080", "B0007WFYB6", "0810910039", "B0006212H2", "B0081NAUN0", "1935202162", "1119941288", "B00000ILEU", "B009WHDEQO", "B003JHXS1E", "1118290143", "3836513013", "1933372001", "B00CD6VY6S", "B003102JDM", "B0087OULO6", "B0001L3LUE", "B001152TL6", "B00CEIOGZG", "B00006RCNV", "0471288314", "1885254008"], "bought_together": ["B000BITUH0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000BITUH0", "B004RV719G", "B000GFRI6I", "B0060O0OJW"]}, "price": 26.96, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 37013}, "asin": "B0006Q93EM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51AN2REV06L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "My Architect: A Son's Journey"}

{"description": "French sensationThe Crimson Riverswas a serial killer thriller with a difference--it was genuinely thrilling. It was also pretty disturbing, but Jean Reno (The Professional) brought some light to the darkness with his sly performance as dog-phobic detective Ni&#xE9;mans. Fortunately, Reno has returned in this highly stylized Luc Besson-penned sequel. Vincent Cassell has not, but Beno&#xEE;t Magimel (The Piano Teacher), as new partner Reda, makes for a decent replacement. Alas, Olivier Dahan isn't in the same league as Matthieu Kassovitz and the story line, which has something to do with the Last Supper, the Maginot Line, and gravity-defying killer monks, is even more convoluted than before. Then there's Johnny Hallyday (The Man on the Train) as a mysterious one-eyed man and Christopher Lee (The Lord of the Rings) as a bad German dude.

{"description": "Thames Television'sThe Tomorrow People(1973-79) was a fondly  remembered U.K. science fiction TV series that drew in teen and adult  audiences on both sides of the Atlantic with its thought-provoking  premise and cliffhanger stories; the show's first two seasons make  their American DVD debut in an impressive four-disc collection. For any  kid struggling with growing pains, the show provided an irresistible  hook: Stephen Jameson (Peter Vaughn-Clarke) discovers that he is no  average teen, but one of the \"Tomorrow People,\" a select group of  youths with extraordinary powers who protect Earth from a host of  threats from space and time.Series creator Roger Price (later the man behindYou Can't Do That on Televisionand other Canadian programming  shown on Nickelodeon, where theTomorrow Peoplealso aired in  the '80s) penned the six serialized stories compiled here (three are  co-written with Brian Finch), which pit the Tomorrow People against a  shape-shifting robot (\"Slaves of Jedikiah\" and \"The Medusa Strain,\" the latter featuring an appearance by David \"Darth Vader\" Prowse), an  evil military organization (\"The Doomsday Men\"), and a villain who  attempts to change the course of history (\"A Rift in Time\"). Modern  teens might guffaw over the show's primitive special effects, but the  stories are engaging and exciting enough to win over even diehard CGI  fans; older viewers should appreciate the care with which this program  has been preserved on DVD. All 26 episodes of the first and second  season are presented here, with cast members Vaughn-Clarke, Nicholas  Young (who played John), and Sammie Winmill (Carol) contributing  commentary on \"Slaves of Jedikiah.\" Bios for the cast round out the  extras on this entertaining collection.--Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000BB1516", "B001HZ4K7Q", "B000F0UURS", "B00L4K450G", "B00KS9V6LA", "B00JF5GAZA", "B00KB614HQ", "B00IWTVDUW", "B00GTZWZH6", "B00J49R0JW", "B00J82PU92", "B00ISSF7S6", "B00HUPC5X8", "B00HUPC5UG", "B00ECXJC28", "B00JDCP0QA", "B0000D1F0P", "B00KAEION6", "B0009JE6FM", "B00KACFMHO", "B00F3L8P26", "B000BB151G", "B000PFUAN2", "B00J49R0ZQ", "B00CDEJRDC", "B00ESFUED6", "B00E5G03I4", "B00CPTUNR4", "B00HT851LO", "B00G7QPX6C", "B00K7IPGS6", "B00DX88IL4", "B00JLDTB2U", "B00HUCF7AO", "B00GQQ77IU", "B00JBGWP3Y", "B008JFUNHI", "B00BHLTIXQ", "B00G5N6C8U", "B00HCK7ZMM", "B00GTZWUPS", "B00GQQ75QO", "B00DUJBVQA", "B0056GLNQI", "B00E3QJ7JC", "B00AKK6MD4", "B0017XOFGE", "B00CRX82LM", "B00FRQ0NYU", "B00FRQ0P5C", "B00DTRR43W", "B00IWTVDXO", "B000Z7G87W", "B009DE6HW4", "B004L9GMC6", "B005GYXN2M", "B00GTZWWXI", "B00F3M3VSS", "B009RZ160W", "B00CDAG0WW", "B00HQOFIA0", "B00GZP0JSC", "B00C6ACUF0", "B005SJGI6I", "B000QGE8I8", "B00272NJ66", "B00FRQ0HOQ", "B008X8VM1W", "B00GZP0M2K", "B003MX91H0", "B00HGE90Z4", "B00BGI07GC", "B000FI9OEA", "B001AGXEBU", "B009T3AGK8", "B00ESZZOCM", "B008JFUS0U", "B00BVMXBDO", "B00HETWFVC", "B00ELMZ60M", "B0035JHYPW", "B008RO876U", "B001MVWMD4", "B00DOZNEG0", "B001QCWQ58", "B008FTX6PO", "B00BD6K54G", "B0002OXVF0", "B008MIYKS0", "B004I1K2FK", "B00FAVRHBE", "B00H57HOSC", "B00005JOJP", "B008D1Q1XI", "B00C6ACWLC", "B00DYZ80CI", "B008D1Q1U6", "B009LDD5XQ", "B00CYQXBSQ", "B000YENUOK"], "bought_together": ["B000BB1516", "B001HZ4K7Q"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001HZ4K7Q", "B00IWTVDUW", "B000BB1516", "B00CDTSFF8"]}, "price": 19.98, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 54881}, "asin": "B0007WFUGU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41AG5Y741ML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Tomorrow People - Set 1"}

{"description": "Is the balance of power in the world, the essentially unequal distribution of wealth and clout that has shaped civilization for centuries, a matter of survival of the fittest&#x85; or merely of the luckiest? InGuns, Germs, and Steel, UCLA professor (and author of the best-seller bearing the same title) Jared Diamond makes a compelling case for the latter. Diamond's theory is that the predominance of white Europeans (and Americans of European descent) over other cultures has nothing to do with racial superiority, as many have claimed, but is instead the result of nothing more, or less, than geographical coincidence. His argument, in a nutshell, is that the people who populated the Middle East's \"fertile crescent\" thousands of years ago were the first farmers, blessed with abundant natural resources (native crops such as wheat and barley, domesticable animals like pigs, goats, sheep, and cows). When their descendents migrated to Europe and northern Africa, climates similar to the crescent's, those same assets, which were unavailable in most of the rest of the world, led to the flourishing of advanced civilizations in those places as well. Add to that their ability to control fire, and Europeans eventually developed the guns and steel (swords, trains, etc.) they used to conquer the planet (the devastating diseases they brought with them, like smallpox, were an unplanned \"benefit\" to their subjugation of, for instance, Peru's native Incas). Spread out over three episodes and two discs and presented with National Geographic's usual style and thoroughness, the program uses location footage (from New Guinea, South America, Africa, and elsewhere), interviews, reenactments, maps, and Diamond's own participation to support his thesis. And while one might disagree with his conclusions, there is no doubt thatGuns, Germs, and Steelis a provocative, classy piece of work.--Sam Graham", "related": {"also_bought": ["B003Q7B77O", "B0032LV4LS", "B002AS461Y", "B009LA1QZS", "0393317552", "B00078XGP6", "0393061310", "B0000AYL48", "B0015XHR5W", "B003C27X44", "0143117009", "B000S0GYNO", "B007PKSN0C", "B000M2E34K", "0765617153", "B003CJXJ8Q", "B001MYIPYQ", "B00HNR3ZF0", "B002TCRQ6I", "B00A2XTHYU", "0307932427", "0814740480", "B006ENHGLS", "B00018U8YE", "0061564818", "B000ANVQ6Y", "0825163374", "B0002IQNF6", "B00006L942", "B00C888HG6", "B0027BOL4G", "B0084IRC88", "B00001IVFT", "B000NO2416", "B001CR499I", "B0047UJBP4", "B00AK51Q8U", "B002DKGWXO", "B000KX0IOA", "0131933884", "0131900072", "B005ELVCP2", "B0007GP836", "B0007R4T3U", "B001EP8EOY", "B001MWGZ6S", "B000R8YC22", "B000ICL3KG", "B00009YXAS", "B00B4TAXXK", "B001IBCS2S", "B0029ATTAQ", "B000EOTEM2", "B0001L3LUE", "B0000639EU", "B00147F8WS", "B001R60ER0", "0742557766", "1571108122", "B0035JHYMK", "B00115Q6N8", "0142402540", "B006J6CED0", "0131014722", "B000096FU4", "B0038P1CXI", "B000784WOK", "B008NNY98U", "B000NTPG84", "0393318885", "B000CSTK7O", "B00005O06X", "B00031TXGI", "B003M986WA", "B00EFFW0TK", "B00CMDPTA4", "B0028FGSQK", "0385265204", "B005YFGIZ2", "B00IAR2CFG", "B0007KIFUA", "B003V5CTN2", "B005HIU9GU", "B003DC8824", "B000Q7ZOLC", "B006QVRWD0", "B00004U2MR", "0060845503", "B0001WTULW", "B002JCSWV6", "6305428360", "B000087F6L", "B00BCMT2EA", "B0035L1PDC", "1580374549", "B0001Z4P46", "B0039ZBM14", "0979885701", "0670024813", "B000XNZ7KM"], "bought_together": ["0393317552"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0393317552", "B009LA1QZS", "0143117009", "B00A2XTHYU"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 26687}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 30.42, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B0009GX1EM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/519WQ1RRQTL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Guns, Germs, and Steel"}

Where the first season focuses on introducing Superman, Metropolis, and a few key bad guys, season two is all about the villains. A few key villains return, including Lobo, series favorite Metallo (voiced by Malcolm McDowell), and of course the evil genius Lex Luthor. But what defines season two is the introduction of new villains such as Superman's evil twin Bizarro (in \"Identity Crisis\" and \"Bizarro's World\"), Livewire (voiced byTank Girlherself Lori Petty), and Luminus (voiced byAirplane!'s Robert Hays). Also new to the series is Mr. Mxyzptlk in one of the best episodes of the series, \"Mxyzpixilated,\" starring the great Gilbert Gottfried as the quirky, interdimensional leprechaun.  One of the series' highlights is the three-part episode \"World's Finest.\" This trilogy is a great cross-over story with guest appearances from the other popular DC animated seriesBatman. Here the man of steel joins forces with the caped crusader to fight Gotham's arch villains the Joker (played by Mark Hamill) and Harley Quinn, who have recently teamed up with Metropolis's Lex Luthor in a plot to kill Superman.Superman: The Animated Series, Season Twois a sharp telling of the Superman story and not to be missed.--Rob Bracco", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000F4RH8E", "B0002ZMHX6", "B000B7QCHC", "B000LE17A2", "B0002ZMHWM", "B0007XG43W", "B000F4RH8O", "B000GYI33Q", "B000CSTK3S", "B00023E894", "B000GYI336", "B000CSTK42", "B000LE1798", "B00LT1JHLW", "B000A9QKL4", "B00005Y71G", "B000A9QKLO", "B0016OM3WC", "B000A9QKLE", "B000YDBP84", "B000FZETS4", "B000F0V0LS", "B000UPMZ1M", "B000M2E32W", "B0018TNMCA", "B000CEXFZ6", "B001A5ES9I", "B000OPODNQ", "B000A59PLU", "B0009UZG28", "B000PFSYO4", "B004L9GM3A", "B001QIVEVE", "B003L7DK88", "B005SH63HO", "B0007XFZMS", "B000PE0G0A", "B00280LZBI", "B004VWKD3M", "B001QIVEVO", "B001LK8SQ6", "B002YOKVUY", "B005HN69G4", "B002DYKPF6", "B00CPEK3NI", "B006PA0WF2", "B00BBAQD6S", "B004QOB8PW", "B0007US7CQ", "B0036EH3XY", "B002DYKPFQ", "B00GZ0ML4C", "B003UN2ICM", "B00CENWUYK", "B0001A7V1U", "B007RG8ZF2", "B00IGVJH0E", "B00CENSU1W", "B005SH6482", "B00HMOW9YM", "B004EE30C8", "B009OAWMK8", "B0036EH3XO", "B0000VCZLG", "B003M8NGLC", "B004AUCDK6", "B007KW5MOU", "B00023E88U", "B00I099JZK", "B003XTUAWI", "B000PC8AKK", "B00ISDJUYI", "B00GZ0ML2Y", "B00GD9GNEY", "B00GD9GNUS", "B004XKVRBE", "B004EE2ZY2", "B003UN2ILS", "B002K0WBDM", "B0081BEZXS", "B002FGUHBE", "B003HKN548", "B0002W4SY0", "B000W2C28Y", "B000CEXFZG", "B000OPODNG", "B00005Y71H", "B00KH57UXS", "B003XTUAHS", "B001614E68", "B001LK8TEM", "B00GJ6HQDI", "B002A5EBLW", "B000TSTEMS", "B00DP9RYDY", "B000FZETRU", "B000M2E33G", "B003Z8ZCDO", "B003ITZBVI", "B001ECQ5SY"], "bought_together": ["B000F4RH8E", "B0002ZMHX6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0007XG43W", "B0002ZMHWM", "B000B7QCHC", "B002LWJ510"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 14900}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 7.88, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B000B7QCGS", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61ksz-jDEQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Superman: The Animated Series, Volume 2 (DC Comics Classic Collection)"}

Meanwhile, cousin Daisy Duke (Jessica Simpson) is reliably available to model her short-shorts (aka \"Daisy Dukes\") and awesome figure (and let's face it, Simpson's talents pretty much begin and end right there), while corrupt honcho Boss Hogg (Burt Reynolds, who should know better) recruits a local NASCAR star to advance his wily scheme of converting Hazzard County into a strip mine. Director Jay Chandrasekhar (Super Troopers) manages to mine some good-natured humor from the movie's oval-track detour and a few colorful supporting players (notably Kevin Hefferman as the Duke's pal Sheev).

{"description": "InLois & Clark's first season, Clark Kent (Dean Cain) and Lois Lane (Teri Hatcher) joined the ranks of Sam and Diane and David and Maddie as TV's sparkiest couples whose devoted fans couldn't wait to see get together. Season 2 takes the star-crossed duo--and the series--to \"the next step\"; a long-awaited first kiss (the episode \"Lucky Leon\"), and declarations of love, culminating in a season-ending marriage proposal (\"And the Answer Is...\"). But getting to that deliriously romantic rain-soaked moment is all the fun. There are diabolical villains for Superman to foil, including a resurrected (and bald) Lex Luthor (John Shea  reprising his first-season role in \"The Phoenix\"), a trash-TV host (Raquel Welch in \"Top Copy), the vengeful Prankster (Bronson Pinchot in \"The Prankster\" and \"Return of the Prankster\"), and, incredibly, a time-traveled Al Capone (William Devane in \"That Old Gang of Mine\"). There is also a romantic rival for Clark's affections, Deputy D.A. Mayson Drake (Farrah Forke in \"Church of Metropolis\") and for Lois's (Jim Pirri as agent Daniel Scardino in \"Resurrection\").Lois and Clark's second season not only features improved special effects, but a stellar roster of character actors: Roger Corman veteran Dick Miller as Lois's uncle and Peter Boyle as Intergang kingpin Bill Church in \"Church of Metropolis\"; a reunited Sherman Hemsley and Isabel Sanford (The Jeffersons) in the Dean Cain-penned holiday episode, \"Season's Greedings\"; Bruce Campbell as Bill Church Jr. in \"Individual Responsibility\"; and Terry Kiser ofWeekend at Bernie'sfame as H.G. Wells in \"Tempus Fugitive,\" the fan-favorite episode in which futuristic villain Tempus spills the beans to the \"galactically stupid\" Lois about Clark's secret identity. \"That was worth the whole trip,\" he cackles, and for series fans, this benchmark (albeit fleeting) moment is probably worth the price of this super six-disc set.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00BBXSPES", "B00BBXSPCK", "B00080ZG2O", "B00AKK6MD4", "B000EU1Q2M", "B004EXWGJW", "B00LT1JKN2", "B00LT1JHLW", "B00DX88IL4", "B00G7QPX6C", "B000HWZ4E8", "B000I8OM94", "B000A5046K", "B000EU1Q3Q", "B001FB4VZS", "B000BT96FA", "B002JVWRDQ", "B0001JXPPC", "B003L77GG0", "B0002Y0QV2", "B0009A5MUO", "B000X5SMXY", "B000G1R4SO", "B00005JLKB", "B000N6SE4U", "B00J49R0ZQ", "B000R206FK", "B001NY4X3W", "B00KTZALDC", "B000J10EQU", "B00BHLTIXQ", "B00AMDA2P8", "B0016QNSGA", "B0001ZMWYG", "B000SMNL92", "B000CQM4YM", "B0000C237S", "B0002NY81C", "B00KS9V6EC", "B000A2X3T8", "B005G5NPD8", "B0012U7IWU", "B000P6XQ50", "B00005JOJR", "B000BUE5D2", "B002K0WBDM", "B002LWJ510", "B0007UDCX0", "B0017VG690", "B001FB4W02", "B00HFWETQW", "B009V9N1NE", "B000OPODNQ", "B0039ZBM3W", "B004XWLN20", "B000E5KQM8", "B00BCMT49I", "B000AJJNIQ", "B000093W4T", "B000GG4Y5K", "B006LG74RE", "B00005JM3A", "B000CSTK42", "B00466H3CC", "B000FO0AHY", "B002JVWRE0", "B00ET6LPRI", "B001AZIRZO", "B000Y7U9AK", "B0025KVNOU", "B003L77FWA", "B009L0NC82", "B000ION23U", "B000IJ79UW", "B002C8YSBU", "B0039ZBM1O", "B0002W4SWW", "B00GM473M6", "B00J9BZ4KC", "B00K7IPGS6", "B00IYRLUAU", "B00JDCP0QA", "B00008KA59", "B001OD8E4G", "B00008KGT0", "B0007US7CQ", "B003L77FWU", "B000EYK4H6", "B0006Z2KZ2", "B00344EAG4", "B00C10EG7A", "B00B58FVBY", "B000O77SN6", "B000WC39P4", "B001DJLD2G", "B001F3FUK6", "B0007US79Y", "B000HWZ4IE", "B00308B170", "B004UQPM4E"], "bought_together": ["B00BBXSPES", "B00BBXSPCK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00080ZG2O", "B00BBXSPCK", "B00BBXSPES", "B000HWZ4BG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 42761}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 19.79, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B000BT96EG", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51-wN-uU1aL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman: Season 2"}
{"description": "This visually stunning film is the product of a collaboration of award-winning graphic novelist Neil Gaiman (creator of the much-laudedSandmanseries), his frequent collaborator Dave McKean (Cages), and The Jim Henson Company, themselves no strangers to elaborate fantasies such asThe Dark Crystal. andLabyrinth. As with the latter film,MirrorMaskfocuses on a young woman unhappy with her daily existence; here, the artistically inclined Helena (Stephanie Leonides), is at odds with her circus performer parents. When a careless insult appears to send her mother (Gina McKee) into a coma, Helena withdraws into the dark and elaborate world of her drawings, in which a scenario very similar to her predicament in the real world is unfolding. Gaiman and director McKean create arresting images to populate Helena's world, and the Henson Company brings them vividly to life with CGI; though the story is occasionally murky, the fantasy elements are imaginative enough to enthrall what will undoubtedly be the film's toughest customers--younger viewers.--Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["B005G1729K", "B002LFPBLU", "B001HN69AY", "B00000JPH6", "B00000K3D4", "B002VRNIZO", "B000934FC2", "B00AEFZ6V4", "B000EU1Q5E", "B003UAKE9Y", "B004QSQMKE", "B002UOMH00", "B000BPL2GK", "B004ALIG0G", "0060821094", "B003RHZ6IE", "B002436WFI", "B0018O4YT0", "B0011E5M66", "B0011NVC98", "B00005JPAR", "B000A283AW", "0060596384", "B002TZS5G0", "B000KJU128", "B00AEFXCLU", "0783225903", "B0031DDG9A", "B0012E2GFK", "B000C3L27U", "B008R52L8E", "B002NZK5SW", "B002FUI4CE", "B0068FZ0O2", "B00DAABKQK", "B000NJMJGG", "1616552107", "B004EPYZU8", "B00005AB62", "B002GOAH10", "B0041T52S6", "B00447L4JG", "B000YAA2SQ", "1401237541", "B00HUCF7AO", "0783225490", "0060798750", "B00003CXBK", "1593077521", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B008QE9XD2", "B003DBLDIQ", "B008JFUPPI", "B0030BS1CU", "B00077BPA0", "B0002V7O3I", "B0001Z37HM", "B002J1RZHE", "B000Q66FB6", "B002NZK5V4", "B004B93RDS", "B00006JDVV", "B0016BWACI", "B000AQOHMG", "B000E1YW2M", "B001HN694K", "B001AGXEAG", "B0010X741Y", "B006VJ1AAI", "B00C888MJ8", "B00005JLEU", "B002LFPBOM", "B0048LPRCS", "006228214X", "0061450162"], "bought_together": ["B005G1729K", "B002LFPBLU"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00000JPH6", "B00000K3D4", "B00004Y7ET", "B002NZK5SW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 30032}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 10.99, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B000BT97AO", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/512BS13XW3L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "MirrorMask"}

{"description": "Like a dream,Howl's Moving Castlecarries audiences to vistas beyond their imaginations where they experience excitement, adventure, terror, humor, and romance. With domestic box office receipts of over $210 million,Howlpassed Miyazaki'sPrincess Mononoketo become the #3 film in Japanese history, behind hisSpirited Awayand James Cameron'sTitanic. Based on a juvenile novel by Diana Wynne Jones,Howl's Moving Castlemarks the first time Miyazaki has adapted another writer's work sinceKiki's Delivery Service(1989). Sophie, a 19-year-old girl who believes she is plain, has resigned herself to a drab life in her family's hat shop--until the Witch of the Waste transforms her into a 90-year-old woman. In her aged guise, Sophie searches for a way to break the Witch's spell and finds unexpected adventures. Like Chihiro, the heroine ofSpirited Away, Sophie discovers her hidden potential in a magical environment--the castle of the title. Using CG, Miyazaki creates a ramshackle structure that looks like it might disintegrate at any moment. Sophie's honesty and determination win her some valuable new friends: Markl, Howl's young apprentice; a jaunty scarecrow; Calcifer, a temperamental fire demon; and Heen, a hilarious, wheezing dog. She wins the heart of the dashing, irresponsible wizard Howl, and brings an end an unnecessary and destructive war. The film overflows with eclipsing visuals that range from frightening aerial battles to serene landscapes, and few recent features--animated or live action--offer as much magic asHowl's Moving Castle.--Charles SolomonThe Many Worlds of Hayao MiyazakiThe works of MiyazakiThe BookThe Art of Howls' Moving Castle(book)Stills fromHowl's Moving Castle(click for larger image)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JLEU", "B00003CXBK", "B002ZTQV8Y", "B002ZTQVHK", "B002ZTQVLG", "B0001XAPZ6", "B002ZTQVGQ", "B005LAIGX2", "B0006J28BO", "B00CSYR432", "B006LLY8LY", "B000CDGVOO", "B0001XAPY2", "0061478784", "B004CRR9EW", "B00ENNO1E6", "B004CRR9G0", "B0009MAO3W", "B00CSYRHG6", "B00B1RB942", "B002ZTQVBQ", "B005LAIGXM", "B00ENNUC9Y", "B00CJ7Y0US", "B007JNTPSO", "B001XUTVLK", "0061477974", "B0009P42S2", "B0023S49YU", "B008XEZXYI", "B008XEZXRA", "6304493681", "B004KL0OW4", "B004916TPG", "B002APNJC4", "B00BEYYEJ4", "B007D5R4GI", "B001QU9RSY", "B007JNTOBC", "B001VBM0Z0", "1421541181", "B002PTBSE6", "B001AXU1DC", "B0054JELWU", "1421566028", "B007V973TO", "B0001IN0MQ", "0316369020", "1569317771", "B00F8PTBLQ", "B009LDCUP0", "B000UPMZ1C", "B000M2E33G", "B00GSPKRN6", "B00005NB94", "1421500493", "B008YRL7JE", "B000FZETRU", "0061478776", "B00CEJIT0S", "B007BMIFL6", "B005NQ5LLY", "B00005RDSQ", "B005W2BWQW", "B0034G4OZE", "B003VQO4W0", "B003SPDSA8", "B0036TGSW6", "B004EC5IUW", "B004EC5IV6", "B0030ZOYHC", "B00576U9EO", "B0055HK792", "B00BQ1DDUG", "B00CU6WC94", "B002ZG97YM", "B007BMIGQ0", "B00CU6WBOU", "B000AAF1U4", "B00005JLR2", "B00JYKNVBW", "B000CEXFZG", "B0018RKEGY", "B001AI7766", "B000OLGCFW", "B001C4ZQEI", "B000LSAIZ8", "B005NQ5LOQ", "B00005JKZV", "B005HVWW6C", "B000FZETI4", "B0049TC8C6", "B008YRL7JO", "B004W75BQU", "B00005JN4W", "B00GWWADDY"], "bought_together": ["B00005JLEU", "B00003CXBK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00003CXBK", "B002ZTQV8Y", "B00005JLEU", "B002ZTQVHK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 1870}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 22.99, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B000CDGVOE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ROjdVz1uL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Howl's Moving Castle"}

{"description": "On the surface, David Cronenberg may seem an unlikely candidate to directA History of Violence, but dig deeper and you'll see that he's the right man for the job. As an intellectual seeker of meaning and an avowed believer in Darwinian survival of the fittest, Cronenberg knows that the story of mild-mannered small-town diner proprietor Tom Stall (Viggo Mortensen) is in fact a multilayered examination of inbred human behavior, beginning when Tom's skillful killing of two would-be robbers draws unwanted attention to his idyllic family life in rural Indiana. He's got a loving wife (Maria Bello) and young daughter (Heidi Hayes) who are about to learn things about Tom they hadn't suspected, and a teenage son (Ashton Holmes) who has inherited his father's most prominent survival trait, manifesting itself in ways he never expected. By the time Tom has come into contact with a scarred villain (Ed Harris) and connections that lead him to a half-crazy kingpin (William Hurt, in a spectacular cameo), Cronenberg has plumbed the dark depths of human nature so skillfully thatA History of Violencestands well above the graphic novel that inspired it (indeed, Cronenberg was unaware of the source material behind Josh Olson's chilling adaptation). With hard-hitting violence that's as sudden as it is graphically authentic, this isA History of Violencethat's worthy of serious study and widespread acclaim.--Jeff ShannonOn the DVDOn a single disc and with little fanfare, this DVD makes an excellent case for the best extras of the year. Dive into the one-hour-long documentary and learn more about moviemaking than on many a double-disc. The secret lies in director David Cronenberg's (and his usual crew) folksy casualness in showing off the craft, be it makeup (green screens were used), directing (Cronenberg doesn't storyboard), or art direction (the diner set). It also is very funny to hear about \"fish Fridays\" and how Maria Bello's Uncle Pete became an influence. Even the infamous sex-on-the-staircase scene is diagnosed with candor as stars Viggo Mortensen and Bello act as if there is no backstage camera. There's only one deleted scene, but it's uncommonly deconstructed on why it was filmed and why it was cut (it's a very Cronenbergian dream sequence). A short bit on Cannes is also a delight. So much is here that Cronenberg's smart commentary track is nearly superfluous. Isn't that a nice surprise?--Doug ThomasMore to ExploreThe Graphic NovelOther Graphic Novels that Inspired MoviesDavid Cronenberg EssentialsWhy We Love Maria BelloThe work of Viggo MortensenThe work of William HurtStills fromA History of ViolenceViggo Mortensoe as Tom StallAshton Holmes as Jack Stall and Kyle Schmid as Bobby JordanWilliam Hurt as Richie CusackEd Harris as Carl Fogarty and Viggo Mortensen as Tom StallMaria Bello as Edie StallDirector David Cronenberg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000YENUI6", "B001LRJH0U", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B008R65XP6", "B004SIP8ZM", "B001FB5634", "B0001EFV7C", "B00004W18Z", "B001EIOOWC", "6301971345", "B000M341QE", "B00000K31T", "B000GFLKF8", "B000P0J0D8", "0767802519", "B004SUDQ72", "B003ASLJQS", "B002PJYPYG", "6304698747", "B000F5WR4W", "B003Y5H4R0", "B0018O4YT0", "B00AEBB9CS", "B0028OH568", "B00HOGBXS6", "B00000JDIQ", "B000FUTVLY", "B002AT8KAG", "B000XR9L50", "6305313687", "0783228457", "B002QEHPQU", "B001FB55L2", "B000Y7WGOW", "B002VWNIEA", "B00022XE6S", "B006PTL1QM", "B000P0J0AG", "B004499LX0", "B00005JMOW", "B002T9H2LA", "B001TOD92C", "B005OK721G", "B000FKO5QK", "B0019EXZY4", "B002ZG99N6", "B0007DFJ0G", "B003LR5BD0", "B003RHZ6F2", "B00AEFY5B6", "B000N6TX1I", "0792833279", "B005LAIIJY", "B000FVQM2Y", "B000FC2FX8", "B001BNFRB2", "B00005JN0W", "B002XMGGK6", "B00007E8UI", "B0064NTZQ2", "B00D3DJIG8", "B0010DR4BO", "B0013XZ6X4", "B00AEFXE9U", "B007D5E7C2", "B000ALM40I", "B00001ZWUS", "B00005V9HH", "B00008RH3L", "0783229402", "B000QXDCLK", "B000P0J0EW", "B000BBOUUE", "B000A7DVR2", "B000K7VHQ4", "B00000F4MA", "B000XA5K48", "B00004XPPB", "B0002IQMAM", "B00029LNYQ", "B00003CXWV", "B004XQO90O", "B000GIW9I2", "B004U7MR14", "B002DKGWSE", "B0064MT1FI", "B0000TANUI", "B009T3AE1Y", "B0000VLKVM", "B00006LPGP", "B00005JLRE", "B000F7CMRM", "B00AEFXESQ", "B001DZOC64", "1558908315", "B0036TGTDE", "B000NOKFHQ", "B008220DGE", "B00007AJE1", "B000BVM1S2"], "bought_together": ["B000YENUI6", "B001LRJH0U"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000YENUI6", "B008MILL78", "B009T3AE1Y", "B000M341QE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 45602}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.36, "brand": "Warner Brothers", "asin": "B000CQLZ0Q", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51g0dghsrYL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "A History of Violence (New Line Platinum Series) [DVD]"}
{"description": "In his third feature, director Noah Baumbach scores a triumph with an autobiographical coming-of-age story about a teenager whose writer-parents are divorcing.  The father (Jeff Daniels) and mother (Laura Linney) duke it out in half-civilized, half-savage fashion, while their two sons adapt in different ways, shifting allegiances between parents.  The film is squirmy-funny and nakedly honest about the rationalizations and compensatory snobbisms of artistic failure as well as the conflicted desires of adolescents for sex and status.  In detailing bohemian-bourgeois life in brownstone Brooklyn, Baumbach is spot on.  Everyone proceeds from good intentions and acts rather badly, in spite or because of their manifest intelligence.  Fulfilling the best traditions of the American independent film, this quirky, wisely written feature explores the gulf between sexes, generations, art and commerce, Brooklyn and Manhattan.", "related": {"also_bought": ["0767821408", "6305428239", "B0010X8NF0", "B0000640VJ", "B0007UC8Y4", "B001QOGYBI", "B002ZG97T2", "B0011NVC8Y", "B007L6VR12", "B000FUF7DA", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B0006TPE4C", "B00005JLX8", "B00007AJF8", "B00005JLRE", "B0014GI6I2", "B00000G02H", "B001P3SA8K", "B004SEUIW4", "B003102JDM", "B00005JMJG", "B00H9HZITU", "B0024HH2WG", "081099741X", "B0081FSMII", "B00005JMJ4", "B003Q7B7CO", "B001E95ZNS", "B00EO2I6SI", "B003L20ICE", "B008220DGE", "B002ZG97TC", "B0035G5IOE", "B009B8YZCQ", "B000C20VVE", "B007L6VR6M", "B0083V2W4U", "B003KGBIS4", "B00003CXQ4", "B000K7VHQE", "B000E33VWW", "B000BX8R1A", "B007UW9W32", "B00003CWTI", "B003N82OP0", "B008Y1YJMM", "B001HN699A", "B000M4RG7E", "B00AEFY8MM", "B00AEBB9CS", "B00GMV8KGW", "B000M5B98A", "B005LAIGF0", "B00GMV8L1Q", "B00JAQJNN0", "B00J5LXQKQ", "B00005AUJK", "B003UESJLU", "B00005Q4CS", "1572527005", "B0016MJ6HY", "B001UV4XGU", "B0089XJXRQ", "B002AFX53M", "B003U6SJYU", "B00IXPQU6M", "B00CIOD6HK", "B001UV4XUG", "B0045O2PHS", "B00007976U", "B005HK13SG", "B000PAAJZ6", "B00606P0BM", "B0002DB52M", "B001DJ7PR8", "B00AEFYSWM", "B004UVYQVY", "B00004XPP8", "B002LVVCJY", "0802867189", "0830827048", "B00008K7AO", "B00D3LA5WG", "B0012E2GFK", "B001CW7ZT4", "B0007OCG5G", "B00005JLSK", "B00AG4760C", "B000FVQM2Y", "0809141183", "0830828052", "B004UXUX4Q", "B000CNESTE", "0205827195", "B00008DP4C", "6304907729", "B005PTMPYA", "B00003CXDJ", "B0042U9B3G", "B0008JIJ10"], "bought_together": ["0767821408", "6305428239"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0007UC8Y4", "B0010X8NF0", "B0000640VJ", "0767821408"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 67820}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.54, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B000CS464G", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Q2MVZ5QRL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Squid and the Whale (Special Edition)"}

Helen, also a widow with ten kids of her own that include the six she and her husband adopted, feels the attraction as well. It&#x92;s no wonder they rush into marriage without telling their kids. True love can conquer all&#x97;right? Unfortunately for Frank and Helen, the families don&#x92;t mesh quite as easily as the newlyweds had hoped. They probably should have seen the culture clash coming: the disciplined Beardsleys run things by the book; for the energetic and vivacious Norths, there is no book. Helen&#x92;s kids aren&#x92;t pleased about moving and sharing rooms with a bunch of uptight strangers. Frank&#x92;s children have nothing in common with the Norths. Since both sets of kids aren&#x92;t happy, they devise a plan to undermine the marriage and team up to plot the breakup. East meets west as the two families finds a way to work together&#x97;in order to separate. Just when it appears that the kids have succeeded, they realize they like each other despite their differences&#x97;they don&#x92;t want their families to split up! Can they save Frank and Helen&#x92;s marriage after they so brilliantly split them up?

Description: An alternate world with an alternate history. The entire planet was divided between two opposing alliances. After fifty years of bitter warfare, the Greater Eastern Federation triumphs over the forces of Europa and gains dominion over the Eurasian continent. However, this is an empty victory. Years of chemical, biological and nuclear war have poisoned the land and left an exhausted population at the mercy of every pestilence and newly-mutated disease. It seems that there's little hope for humanity's future. Debate rages over the chances of finding some way to stave off the seemingly-inevitable decline of civilization. One man comes forward with a possible solution. Dr. Azuma is a geneticist who proposes a \"neo-cell\" treatment that can rejuvenate the body and regenerate humankind. He's driven in his studies by a desire to save his beloved wife, Midori, from the ravages of pollution-related disease. He appeals for funding to the government but the politicians in the Health Ministry turn him down, fearing that the new technology will threaten their entrenched powers. However, a sinister faction in the powerful military makes a secret offer to provide the support he needs to further his research. When an incident occurs in the lab that sends the Professor's \"neo-cell\" cloning experiment haywire, a race of mutant human beings (Shinzo Ningen) is unleashed upon the world. Instead of being the savior of mankind, the Professor's miraculous technology looks set to threaten its very existence...", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001AZIRWW", "B00011V8JA", "B002BWD74G", "B000F2CAJ2", "B004DMIIUU", "B004DMIIO6", "B00A92MDMM", "B000HXDWOG", "B0043988KS", "B00B209RHY", "B00G3HOJZ6", "B000IMUYM4", "B00A92MBBA", "B008XEZXES", "B006C1S1DY", "B0019PL2W0", "B002KYIAKQ", "B002MD2YUM", "B0043988NK", "B0012SY0E6", "B00065GX0K", "B0002IQHAW", "B001UJUH1M", "B00J806VWY", "B0036BDQ2Y", "B001570H5K", "B00009RXI6", "B000JBXP5W", "B002C6VMIY", "B008IG0B0C", "B000FC2EWU", "B000E0OBKG", "B004XQO8MS", "B006H3KQSK", "B00J5LXS4U", "B00FJX967G", "B008L0YMSW", "B008D1RCKY", "B002P7UCJK", "B00ITAQ11U", "B00C6WHSRI", "B000GBEWNY", "B00CG0YLS4", "B00AN5LD2Q", "B005ENCIWG", "B00C3ALL9O", "B009VL2A5M", "B00005V4XG", "B0043988KI", "B001JTTJ94", "B005M9VSMI", "B008HHTEUU", "B00097E71C", "B001F0TT10", "B0030A6ICG", "B002KYIAL0", "B004VW4V9E", "B0000CABGW", "B00005ALMX", "B00287Z1CK", "B005F96UGO", "B000C6NP7M", "B0016K76V4", "B004GZZH6W", "B0009P42S2", "B004P2VQZ2", "B000JU8H74", "B005F96URI", "B008FIPQOE", "B00CG0YM24", "B00GXG16BC", "B0016LHH62", "B00HRYH52I", "B001AYWYEA", "B00GXGLQOO", "B004H2CXBQ", "B001BEK87Y", "B001MEJY9G", "B005HVWWB2", "B0056OZI0W", "B000FILUL0", "B00G3HOLV8", "B00104AYGK", "B00B4MMVVY", "B003NLE5J0", "B0007939U2", "B0002LJTF4", "B0002ZYE64", "B005ZMBEXU", "B006MWA8UW", "B00HSJ2BEE", "B0083QJW8O", "B00576U9HQ", "B003Y7F1IW", "B0017SVH5Q", "B000ICLU7C", "B006L4MWVE", "B00HXEWECI", "B009VL29I0", "B005HVWVCC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004DMIIUU", "B00DW5IM3W", "B00B209RHY", "B00A92MBBA"]}, "price": 17.88, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 241977}, "asin": "B000EDH80I", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41M0JT7Q53L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Casshern (DVD)"}

{"description": "The legend of Pocahontas and John Smith receives a luminous and essential retelling by maverick filmmaker Terrence Malick. The facts of Virginia's first white settlers, circa 1607, have been told for eons and fortified by Disney's animated films: explorer Smith (Colin Farrell) and the Native American princess (newcomer Q'orianka Kilcher) bond when the two cultures meet, a flashpoint of curiosity and war lapping interchangeably at the shores of the new continent. Malick, who took a twenty year break between his second and third films (Days of Heaven and The Thin Red Line), is a master of film poetry; the film washes over you, with minimal dialogue (you see characters speak on camera for less than a quarter of the film). The rest of the words are a stream-of-consciousness narration--a technique Malick has used before but never to such degree, creating a movie you feel more than watch. The film's beauty (shot in Virginia by Emmanuel Lubezki) and production design (by Jack Fisk) seems very organic, and in fact, organic is a great label for the movie as a whole, from the dreadful conditions of early Jamestown (it makes you wonder why Englishman would want to live there) to the luminescent love story. Malick is blessed with a cast that includes Wes Studi, August Schellenberg, Christopher Plummer, and Christian Bale (who, curiously, was also in the Disney production). Fourteen-year-old Kilcher, the soul of the film, is an amazing find, and Farrell, so often tagged as the next big thing, delivers his first exceptional performance since his stunning debut in Tigerland. James Horner provides a fine score, but is overshadowed by a Mozart concerto and a recurring prelude from Wagner's Das Rheingold, a scrumptious weaving of horns fit to fuel the gentle intoxication of this film. Note: the film was initially 150 minutes, and then trimmed to 135 by Malick before the regular theatrical run. It was also the first film shot in 65mm since Kenneth Branagh's Hamlet. --Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000NOKFHQ", "B000VMIILU", "B000TXNDV6", "B00005PJ8T", "1573623903", "B000UVV24M", "B005LLX582", "B000MGB6NM", "B005KQVE1S", "B000FIHN5M", "B00CX7OW1G", "B003M987QK", "B0012Q732O", "B00003CXBH", "B0009PW4EQ", "B0002Y4PPK", "B005HV6Y5W", "B003LL3FIY", "B00J11U54K", "B004UOHNIY", "B000VKL6ZM", "B00KHWSB5M", "B0001I55YW", "B002O3Z50Q", "B00005QW6V", "0783231202", "B00004XPPG", "B00003CXAF", "B000ARXF8W", "B001MZ5W3M", "B003EYVXRS", "B00406UK7S", "B000A2WP7O", "B00I6JODGO", "B004AOECXI", "B000AARKOO", "B000J4QWMC", "B002GHHHHO", "B0018BD9DA", "B004C45AZU", "B000CQLZ0Q", "B0013D8LC2", "B003EYVXXW", "B0007UDC80", "B000R9U3B0", "B007PXYWNQ", "B0032LV4LS", "B003Y5H5FG", "B00019330O", "B0000TANUI", "B000UJ48SQ", "B00007GZYC", "B000F7CMRM", "B00005JKTP", "B0002YLCG0", "B004P2VQZC", "B002O3Z510", "B006ISJQ26", "B009AMAJPA", "B00009MEKN", "B007WZTMCI", "B003L20IG0", "B000CEV3P0", "B0002DRDBY", "B000ZOXDFA", "B000ASDFF4", "B00AEBB89W", "B00AEFXVCU", "B008220C38", "B00005JLX2", "B007REV4LQ", "B009INAI02", "B000XR9L50", "B005LAII3A", "B00005OSJN", "B002DHACT2", "B00BB67UNW", "B008JFUNKU", "B00005R23V", "B00140PK82", "B00005221M", "B000087F0X", "B00G4Q3KOC", "B004EPYZT4", "B003UYUQZW", "B00AEFY5B6", "B004CQZFH6", "B002ZG977Y", "0800177967", "B001L57ZZG", "B00DL48BM6", "B001JIE7JC", "B003Y7F1OG", "B000N3SU92", "B000NIVJF4", "B001KO1BCQ", "B005J7K9BO", "B000LC55F2", "B0045HCJ9O"], "bought_together": ["B000NOKFHQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000NOKFHQ", "B00005PJ8T", "B005LLX582", "B000VMIILU"]}, "price": 10.08, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 386879}, "asin": "B000EOTTTU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/519FGGE3C5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The New World"}
{"description": "IfNight Stalkerhad been given a chance to establish its own identity, this \"reimagining\" of the popularearly '70s TV moviesmight have thrived. Instead, many viewers perceived the short-lived series as a thinly disguisedX-Filesspinoff, with formerX-Filesproducer Frank Spotnitz apparently hired to recycleX-Filesplots in a slightly different format. That's not necessarily a bad thing, since the series boasts superior production values and dark, sometimes violent horror plots as effectively creepy as anything seen onX-Files. But fans of the original (both TV movies and 1974 series) bristled at ABC's obvious youth-market makeover that turned Darren McGavin's original \"Carl Kolchak\" from a cynical, sarcastic middle-aged reporter on the fringes of journalism into a hip, handsome, Mustang-driving young reporter (played by Irish actor Stuart Townsend) who's literally marked for death in what was intended (if the series had survived) to be an epic battle of good vs. evil. By pairing Kolchak with an equally young, attractive, and skeptical colleague named Perri Reed (Gabrielle Union), the series struggled to find its place among such popular shows asMediumand theCSIjuggernaut, and there just wasn't enough originality to keep viewers interested. Ratings plummeted after the pilot premiered on September 29, 2005, and of the ten episodes produced and included here, only six were broadcast before the show's inevitable cancellation.As Spotnitz conceived it (with severalX-Filesveterans serving as directors or consulting producers),Night Stalkerrevolved around an epic \"mythology\" that would've emerged had the series continued. Spotnitz outlines these broader details in his smart, informative DVD commentaries, allowing viewers a greater appreciation of how the series was being planned. As it stands, the new Kolchak is striving to solve the violent, monstrous attack that killed his wife, and his ongoing investigations draw him deeper into supernatural events, mostly explored in episodes so similar toX-Filesthat you could easily exchange Kolchak and Reed for agents Mulder and Scully and barely notice the difference. From their high-rise offices at the Los Angeles Beacon (beautifully filmed in high-def digital video), Kolchak and Reed solve brutal murders, bizarre deaths, and other mysteries with the help of photographer Jain McManus (Eric Jungman) and editor Tony Vincenzo (Cotter Smith), while a cynical FBI agent (semi-regular cast member John Pyper-Ferguson) suspects Kolchak of killing his wealthy wife to inherit her estate. As these 10 episodes demonstrate, the hard-won trust between Kolchak and Reed would become the series' emotional anchor, with Townsend and Union establishing an appealing chemistry that served the series well.Unfortunately,Night Stalkerwas doomed from the start. The series was cancelled in the midst of a two-part episode, leaving viewers with an unresolved cliffhanger and unanswered questions about the mysterious \"four horsemen of the apocalypse\" biker gang that's been a looming threat throughout these episodes. Thanks to Spotnitz's detailed commentaries and video interview included on this two-disc set (along with printable DVD-ROM scripts from unproduced episodes), these and other mysteries are tantalizingly explained, and these tenNight Stalkerepisodes stand as testament to a high-quality series that never had a chance to prove its long-term potential.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000ATQYWY", "B0037AGB9O", "B0051GOB2G", "B000FJH5M2", "B000N3T0EG", "B000FS9MY2", "B003PGNBO8", "B001QE99BA", "B002QU1Z1K", "B0012IX35S", "B000FOPPBA", "B004XM38CS", "B00026L7OU", "B0002S94BQ", "B001RXDM2M", "B000E5N6B6", "B000QUEQ4U", "B002DQSKME", "B00BHLTIXQ", "B008I34YOO", "B001A7GOCA", "B0007CEXUY", "B002TQKL7A", "B0055SNHQG", "B00KTZALDC", "B000KF0DDY", "B000A9QKT6", "B008B4KVRE", "B00LLTY4M4", "B004YPED14", "B00404ME2E", "B00LPY2I1E", "B000FIHN8O", "B0081QF6Q8", "B007G4X7VC", "B004P7CNVS", "B000ELL1QC", "B003LXM1PK", "B0010TDRP0", "B0056GLNQI", "B0011FLH00", "B0006J27WO", "B00F3L8P26", "B00KO72WNC", "B000CEV3MI", "B00ECXJC28", "B000ATQYXI", "B000JLTRHW", "B00CRX82LM", "B0012IXBNC", "B00JF5GAZA", "B002U0KHME", "B0038MUZ3E", "B00170LCWC", "B000E8JO2S", "B003R0MEYA", "B009ERK2UI", "B00344EAG4", "B00013D54Y", "B00007AJE1", "B00023BKMC", "B006TBYC76", "B0006UEVUE", "B000FUTVPA", "B000MMMTD2", "B003LXM1B4", "B00GTZWZH6", "B004QOB8TS", "B00465I156", "B002H6NVM4", "B004HHX9T6", "B002FG9N50", "B000SMNL92", "B00B04NIZO", "B002FLOTPO", "B001CQONOA", "B007MDB6UQ", "B009LDD5XQ", "B004LROMS4", "B002DLB1H0", "B001CQONMC", "B0002CX1M0", "B00E5G03J8", "B00BD6K54G", "B001KEGR5W", "B001DXS4DI", "B008HSK3PE", "B00DPJEWD4", "B00000FA91", "B008H1Q61G", "B003NOGNQU", "B003H9LIU2", "B00005JN8Q", "B000FJH5MC", "B005GYXN2M", "B00IKM5N1G", "B0025KVKDO", "B0009JE6G6", "B000HEVZ94", "B0009JE6FM"], "bought_together": ["B000ATQYWY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000ATQYWY", "B00026L7OU", "B0051GOB2G", "B000FFJZO2"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 19972}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 10.39, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B000EOTV98", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5147K6AC32L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Night Stalker - The Complete Series"}

{"description": "Hollow Man 2ups the ante established by Paul Verhoeven's 2000 science fiction thriller by involving not one but two invisible men in this direct-to-home-video sequel. Christian Slater is top billed as a former Army assassin who volunteers to undergo the same invisibility experiments endured by Kevin Bacon in the original film. Like before, Slater is rendered transparent but also dangerously unstable, and detectives Peter Facinelli and Laura Regan are called in to stop his killing spree. Scripter Joel Soisson has had a hand in most of the recent horror/thriller franchise sequels (Hellraiser,Dracula,Mimic, and others), so he understands what's required to draw in genre fans (violence, special effects, nudity); what he's less capable at producing is an un-cliched script, which essentially strands Swiss director Claudio Fah and the cast (who are much better than the material). Undiscerning horror enthusiasts might check this out hoping for a quick thrill--and they'll find it here, but not much else.-- Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00003CXKA", "B00IARA8KM", "B005TK0MFE", "0767802497", "B002GHHHL0", "B0016QNSGA", "B000UAFDPM", "B000V4UFZK", "B00GNAO70K", "B001JFZ118", "B001AV3BYK", "0783240961", "B00HX0KIAM", "B0009A40NE", "B000UJ48P4", "B0009X763M", "B001RHGRT8", "B00DTPRZ10", "B000BUNZY2", "B00004TJMW", "B00005JN2Z", "B000F6IOCA", "B00B04NIL8", "B000AWYOGE", "B004P7CN7W", "B0000959N0", "B00BEL4QFO", "B00005JMXX", "B000OVLBHG", "B000FOQ1KY", "B008XJM6H0", "B000TGJ82Q", "B004SUDQDQ", "B0053TWV46", "B0001FR3IQ", "B002O5M4T4", "B00F84H73Q", "B000FSME9W", "B0009P42WI", "B005LAIIB2", "B001YYQ9S8", "B000RBA6C4", "B000VNMMR0", "B00005K3NZ", "0767821769", "B007R6DJP8", "B007JE3JQW", "B000J4QWMC", "B00004Z1FX", "B002LMSWN2", "B008JFUS0U", "B00AZMFJ90", "B00111YM5Q", "B00BTYMPUY", "B000OVLBF8", "B0000E2R6P", "0767817478", "B005LAIGW8", "B00AEFY99O", "B0000648ZQ", "B0018RNF60", "B000P0J06K", "B00H1RMWYW", "6305065551", "B00005JM7T", "B005LAIHSG", "B004LWZW2O", "B00AIBZLVY", "B00008K7AM", "B001B1UO6W", "B00003CXMP", "B00005RYLX", "B001132GNY", "B00AEFYYH6", "B000UR9T8C", "B00BUC4TJ0", "0783225482", "B002IPFWTE", "B003Y5H54W", "B00005JG6N", "B008JFUNYG", "B00BTYSIWI", "B00AEFXT1S", "B00005N5S5", "B0006J28MI"], "bought_together": ["B00003CXKA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00003CXKA", "B00126XCR4", "B008XAT0OG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 90375}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.98, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B000EU1Q6I", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/513PBYMAJKL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Hollow Man 2"}

{"description": "The Cryptkeeper dusts off another set of horror yarns in this fourth collection ofTales from the Crypt, featuring more semi-big-stars, a handful of name directors, and a bevy of excruciatingly bad puns. There are some goodies here if you're nostalgic for 1950s-era comic-book scares (or for vintage 1992 late-night pay-cable), but this fourth season represents diminishing returns for the franchise. The 14 episodes get off to a poor start with the first installments, including \"None but the Lonely Heart\" (directed by Tom Hanks, who cameos), about a Lothario (Treat Williams) who marries and kills rich old ladies, and \"This'll Kill Ya\" (directed by Robert Longo), about a nasty drug researcher (Dylan McDermott). The series' very sporadic nudity is provided here by Sonia Braga.Of the famous directors represented, best in show is John Frankenheimer, whose \"Maniac at Large\" makes sinuous use of a single set, a large library; Blythe Danner plays a meek librarian in fear of a serial killer, and Salome Jens (star of Frankenheimer's \"Seconds\") is her shrewish boss. Elsewhere, William Friedkin should be embarrassed by \"On a Deadman's Chest,\" an extremely silly rock & roll thing about a tattoo with a life of its own. And Richard Donner's \"Showdown,\" while providing a welcome bit of Western atmosphere, is either an existential puzzler or an unfinished production. The directorial novelty must be \"Split Personality\", a story of a con man (Joe Pesci) seducing a wealthy pair of twins. It's one of the more entertaining episodes, and it marks the sole directing outing for Hollywood mega-producer (andTalesexec producer) Joel Silver. For sheer perversity, few segments top \"Beauty Rest\", in which aspiring actress Mimi Rogers ends up regretting a successful audition (with Buck Henry, of all people).The biggest rising-star find is probably Brad Pitt in \"King of the Road\", a lame tale of hotrod racers. Timothy Dalton, then fresh from his James Bond run, stars in one of the better shows in this set, \"Werewolf Concerto,\" a clever piece about a werewolf hunter staying at a lodge terrorized by a lycanthrope. Perhaps the most sustained episode--nailing the series' blend of campy humor and gory fright--is \"What's Cookin',\" in which Christopher Reeve, the owner of an all-squid restaurant, revitalizes the business by switching to a different kind of meat.The minimal extras are a commentary track for the Chris Reeve episode (including the voice of the Cryptkeeper, John Kassir) and a perfunctory montage about the season's stars. The show has a loyal following that will be happy to own this set, but for anybody else it must be noted that season 4 is a year of decline, and not the place to start for horror-curious boils and ghouls.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000E1MXWS", "B000GYI322", "B000SULWKO", "B000P0J0E2", "B000A88EU0", "B006BZ8NSE", "B0009ETCOW", "B0030E5PYO", "B000Q66Q56", "B00IWOHG76", "B00LMBURDG", "B003VJTGNE", "B00LBFFR2Y", "B00KTFJ50M", "B004SUDQCW", "B0053TWV46", "B000RXVNCO", "B00J3LXLNA", "B00L89VL96", "B00ENFVQIS", "B00KDU8HQQ", "B00GSMZ3I8", "B00ITOB5NU", "B00ITOB5DK", "B00I3C347S", "B00LLAV26O", "B002GHHHG0", "B00GHH9IIA", "B00FFC13EU", "B00ER7OQIE", "B002EP8FDI", "B00HRUQB8Q", "B002FLOTPO", "B002HK9HZU", "B008CYDD7I", "B00HRUQ7WG", "B00GSTHD1G", "B00K1L4NBU", "B000HC2LX0", "B00IKD4D1G", "B0000APVJ0", "B0000AOX0B", "B0002VYOVS", "B00JHH21C2", "B00E3RH37Y", "B0000AOX0C", "B00IVFCM2U", "B00D7TS972", "B000N2HD6Y", "B00ER7OQDE", "B001DXS4DI", "B0007WFXNA", "B00FPM1BME", "B00A429Y56", "B001LM64VA", "B00K7PB3ZY", "B00009YXHN", "B006TBYC76", "B00013D54Y", "B00EL6ACBQ", "B000UYX4PO", "B006TURZA8", "B00AEFYV9W", "B000WC384Q", "B001957A44", "B00AGKHG06", "B00DUARBNG", "B00363WGIM", "B001B3LIQA", "B0024FAG44", "B008HSK3PE", "B002JHD9D2", "B00006FDBT", "B00IJZPZLW", "B00J0RZKE0", "B00CHFOZN4", "B00AZTUUQK", "B00IJZPZM6", "B00BTYPW7C", "B004XQVCCW", "B00IJZPZLC", "B00005JOJE", "B000RIWAV2", "B00005KH30", "B000BYA4JW", "B00BN3DZZA", "B006ZUMOX0", "B001JAHSAA", "B0058S0OMS", "B0002CX1M0", "B003PIUINI", "B00EALTVPA", "B0002J4ZX2", "B00JHH1W9K", "B00DW5ILJC", "B00005N5RM", "B00JGR3M80", "B000JU7JIW", "B00E0EXYMS", "B000HEVZ94"], "bought_together": ["B000E1MXWS", "B000GYI322"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0030E5PYO", "B000A88EU0", "B003NKU9XM", "B000SULWKO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 9409}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 15.09, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B000FFJYC0", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61M5H7RC0SL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Tales from the Crypt: Season 4"}

{"description": "Over-the-top yet well-written,Nip/Tuckwas one of the most intriguing shows on television&#x85; until season three, when it took everything--everything--way too far. What once used to be a show about self-worth and society's perception of beauty as portrayed by plastic-surgery patients has become about the abject humiliation of women and rampant storylines. It alienated many fans, who found its love of excess ludicrous and at times, unforgivable. Maybe it was the storyline about Matt (John Hensley), who discovers the love of his life was actually a transsexual, shaves his head and starts dating a white supremacist (American Dreams'Brittany Snow). Or the disturbing new plastic-surgery cases (obese woman physically stuck to her couch, a 17-year-old petrified fetus). Or even the new surgeon Quentin Costa (Bruno Campos) who sleeps with male patients, romances Julia (Joely Richardson) and turns out to have a little \"physical quirk\" of his own? But the knife that truly stabbed the show's pace into the ground was the ongoing mystery of the Carver, a rapist/killer in a creepy porcelain mask who disfigures victims. Just when the show starts to jell, another character with their mouth cutBlack Dahlia-style turns up and throws the show back into a whodunnit, and not even a well-crafted one at that: By the time they reveal the killer's identity, you just don't care anymore.Someone also made a mess of the characters, or at least turned them all manic-depressive; the moral flip-flopping between Sean (Dylan Walsh) and Christian (Julian McMahon) is inexplicable at best.

{"description": "The writing-directing team of Angelo Pizzo and David Anspaugh  tries to do for soccer what their filmsHoosiersandRudydid for, respectively, basketball and football. Here's another true story, a legendary upset in the early days of the World Cup. In 1950, America hastily forms a team to play against the world. We center on a tight Italian community in St. Louis providing the bulk of the national team. We meetGQ-ready stars led by goalie Frank Borgi (The Phantom of the Opera's Gerald Butler, deftly handling the duties). This brotherhood of players is unfortunately strapped to play off clich&#xE9;s and the movie never really engages us beyond the autumn-tinged scenery. A big part of the blame goes to the narrator telling us what we should be feeling (perhaps because we dumb Americans don't know soccer, er, football, like the rest of the world). No fault in the performance of the narrator/journalist (played by Patrick Stewart as the elder, Terry Kinney as the younger) or the rest of the cast. Perhaps the game is elusive to cinematic grandeur, (how many memorable soccer movies can you name?), but the movie is also tired and slow, something those earlier sports films were not. There's only a brief stirring when the earnest Gino (Louis Mandylor) has a wedding-date conflict and as the most famous English player of the day, Stanley Mortenson (Gavin Rossdale), patronizes the Americans in a public speech. Perhaps the studio knew they had a cellar dweller; the film was barely released and retitled for home video echoing the moniker of the 1980 U.S. Olympic hockey team. Soccer kids will enjoy the film, but others better stick to Geoffrey Douglas's book,The Game of Their Lives, the film's original title (and mistakenly left on the end credits).--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000GJ0LLI", "B0016MJ6GU", "B007K7IBCK", "B0045HCIXG", "B0076YFJJA", "B000E0WJUA", "B000GRUMZU", "B000T9D5WM", "B0009ML1SE", "B0001LYFV8", "B0017PB5VA", "B000J6I0V6", "B00005JM2Y", "B00027NVXE", "B0009PBLU4", "B001D7WF98", "B000GIXEIG", "B001GZ6PUC", "B00A2H9UG6", "B00007AJF4", "B00007FSAD", "B000V8VNUM", "B002WVCRK6", "B000ADWDE8", "B0000C238U", "B003HDYOTU", "B00AEFYGBA", "0060758775", "B0000DZTNB", "B003BEE292", "B00AEBB8QK", "B0028S77PS", "1469982471", "B00AAQHP66", "B002ZG998G", "B00CBK6506", "1492152986", "B00946G2YE", "1780975503", "B000RL6G82", "B00CAYH2S2", "1416293302", "B001APZMJS", "B000A2XB4U", "B001AYWY6S", "075662987X", "0062220667", "1429648708", "0060931590", "1780974051", "B00006JDVV", "B000HRMATU", "B004XYOQU4", "1938591097", "B004X2TYG2", "B00080ZH3M", "B004X2TYEY", "0316044849", "0789212110", "0957051190", "B007VHCJR2", "B00KI0COAQ", "0847840921", "1410955184", "B005SQRYEG", "B00DW5IL92", "B002ZQX09K", "B000EXZFCQ", "B000R7G6H2", "B001ARDC1Q", "1780975511", "B000FTCF2W", "1906850399", "B00ITTYWLC", "B00007FSA7", "1906850615", "0805038752", "B002JCSWV6", "B004VS5ZUC", "B000M7XREW", "1906850623", "1465417494", "0789326612", "1592138853"], "bought_together": ["B000GJ0LLI", "B0016MJ6GU"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000GJ0LLI", "B0045HCIXG", "B0016MJ6GU", "B0076YFJJA"]}, "price": 9.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 15494}, "asin": "B000G8P1Y6", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515RRQ19JGL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Miracle Match"}

{"description": "You probably don't think you need to see another remake ofLassie, but you do. Charles Sturridge's (Brideshead Revisited) film was criminally neglected in theaters but should gain a lofty status on home video as did remakes ofThe Secret Garden,A Little Princessand Sturridge's ownFairyTale: A True Story. It's a simple story of a dog who loves a boy so much she'll cross a country to reunite with him. Yes, you might need your handkerchief. No, not that much. Mom Sarah (Samantha Morton), dad Sam (John Lynch) and their son Joe (an adorable Jonathan Mason) live in an English coal town shortly before the Second World War. To put food on the table, Lassie is sold to The Duke of Rudling (Peter O'Toole, in fine form) for his granddaughter, Cilla (Hester Odgers). Soon the Duke and Lassie retire to Scotland, some 500 miles away, but neither distance, status, an angry kennel man, nor bumbling dog catchers will keep Lassie from Joe. Along the roads and hills of England (with Ireland scenery subbing in), Lassie touches many folks including a lovelorn lady (Kelly MacDonald), a scientist (Edward Fox), and most notably, a traveling performer (Peter Dinklage). Sturridge's deft touch allows the film to breathe with a great sense of physical comedy for the kids that never descends into pure shenanigans. There is just enough heart-tugging to go along with the scenic adventure. The cast is uniformly strong, with fine work from O'Toole, Morton, and Dinklage. Throw in beautiful scenery, cute dogs, Adrian Johnson's dramatic score, a cameo from the Loch Ness monster(!), and you have a winner; our pick for the best family film on DVD in 2006.

{"description": "It's appropriate that this extravaganza of lowbrow cinema had its premiere at the 2006 Cinevegas Film Festival, because what happens inArtie Lange's Beer Leagueshould stay inArtie Lange's Beer League. Lange is most recognizable for his stint in theMad TVensemble, but probably more idolized by the people who will get wild kicks from his leading man debut as the resident guest-baiter and booze/scatological/flatulence/sex joke expert on Howard Stern's radio show. Those are the same kinds of laughs this movie relies on in telling the wisp of a story about a bunch of New Jersey boneheads whose lives are fulfilled by softball games and the beer-guzzling that goes on before, during, and after. Artie's team is proud to be in the bottom ranks of their league, especially when brawls erupt at games against their slick, archrival team. Artie and the rest of his team know these arrogant jerks in their immaculate black (of course) uniforms are unbeatable, so it's only natural that Artie thinks its easier to just beat the hell out of them. The local cop who's had to deal with both teams finally gets so angry with the escalating brawls that he issues an ultimatum: Whichever team loses the season has to disband and never play on the league again. It's kind of an utterly tasteless version ofThe Bad News Bearsfor people who like their movies vulgar, offensive, misogynistic, and often really funny in spite of it all. Some of the subplots and supporting players include Ralph Macchio as one of Artie's childhood friends who's about to get married (cue depraved bachelor party scene with lots of topless babes), Mary Birdsong fromReno 911!as a kooky waitress, and a delightful turn by crusty character actor Seymour Cassel as Artie's teammate Dirt, who may be old but loves booze, fisticuffs, and debauchery as much as anyone. For some reason, Artie's foul-mouthed slobbery attracts a local Jersey girl (Cara Buono), even though he's jobless and still lives with his mom (Laurie Metcalf, who should get some kind of good sport award). The buffoonery doesn't just stop with the movie. There's also more than two hour of bonus material tailored for Artie Lange enthusiasts who probably number more than you'd think -- whether they'd ever admit it or not.--Ted Fry", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792842162", "6305222908", "0385526571", "0385526563", "B000JJ4DNW", "B002TZS4UW", "1476765111", "B0006ZXTRK", "1476765596", "B00007AJGM", "B00AEFYZCU", "B000EMGJAO", "B00363WGBO", "B00005JKMN", "B001UV4X8S", "0792846435", "B00AEFYKWU", "B001G5T6GW", "B0000399WD", "B003NHMYI8", "B000I0RNVQ", "B00AEFYS2M", "B0079ZWTOO", "B000BKVQS4", "B00003CXWV", "B00005V0XF", "B000WZEZGI", "B000C20VPA", "B000EGDBZ6", "B001J9KJ4I", "B0000DD76S", "B000M341QE", "B0001BKAJO", "078324021X", "B002QF31GC", "B004SIP95G", "B0000A14TA", "B00029RTAI", "B000FBNG1O", "B00CE00ZV8", "0783230338", "B002T4GWWA", "B0006Q941Y", "0783227981", "B00AEFYSL8", "B00BEIYLO8", "B004SIP8ES", "B00AEFZ8OY", "B002ZG99H2", "B0068FZ0GK", "B002ZG99N6", "B000P0J09M", "B00AEBBA2C", "B00009AOAW", "B00006AUIH", "B003ASLJO0", "B000Y7U93C", "B0060ZJ7BC", "B00441GZ14", "B0000A02TZ", "B00004XPPB", "B0006HBZEW", "B0002V7TMY", "B000P0J0EW", "B002ZG98B4", "B000IY04Q8", "B000QXDCLA", "B0053TWVDC", "B000G0O5I2", "0800177258", "B00AEFYJI0", "B003CRM6PA", "B000F6ZIIS", "B00441GYVA", "B0006GAOJA", "B000G6BLWE", "B005LAII12", "B00028HBES", "B00004U103", "B00004Y87O", "B002O3Z4YI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002NALPKO", "0385526571", "1476765596", "0792842162"]}, "price": 5.66, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 148057}, "asin": "B000JCEB0E", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51CGq03DC%2BL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Artie Lange's Beer League featuring Artie Lange &amp; Ralph Macchio"}

{"description": "First screened in Europe and scheduled for limited release in the U.S.,The Illusionistoffers welcome proof that \"arthouse\" quality needn't be limited to the arthouses. Set in turn-of-the-century Vienna, this stately, elegant period film benefited from a crossover release in mainstream cinemas, and showed considerable box-office staying power--granted, teenage mallrats and lusty males may have been drawn to the allure ofSeventh Heavenalumna Jessica Biel, who rises to the occasion with a fine performance. But there's equal appeal in the casting of Edward Norton and Paul Giamatti, who bring their formidable talents to bear on the intriguing tale of a celebrated magician named Eisenheim (Norton) whose stage performance offends the Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell), a vindictive lout who aims to marry Duchess Sophie (Biel), Eisenheim's childhood friend and now, 15 years later, his would-be lover. This romantic rivalry and Eisenheim's increasingly enigmatic craft of illusion are investigated by Chief Inspector Uhl (Giamatti), who's under Leopold's command and is therefore not to be trusted as Eisenheim and Sophie draw closer to their inevitable reunion. Cleverly adapted by director Neil Burger from Steven Millhauser's short story \"Eisenheim the Illusionist,\" and boasting exquisite production values and a fine score by Philip Glass,The Illusionistis the kind of class act that fully deserved its unusually wide and appreciative audience. --Jeff ShannonBeyondThe Illusionist\"Eisenheim the Illusionist\" and Other StoriesPaul Giamatti in a More Loveable RoleMagic Kits & AccessoriesStills fromThe Illusionist", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000LC55F2", "B000NOIX48", "B002ZG980U", "B002WNU0QW", "B00DWZHTOU", "B001MZ5W3M", "B00011CZRE", "B000H0MKI8", "B00008K7AO", "B000L212HC", "B00AEBB8NI", "B000GFLKF8", "B000O76ZO4", "B00003CXZ4", "B00005JLSB", "B000FKO5QK", "B000M341QE", "B00AEFXGIY", "B00005V9HH", "B00AEBB8LA", "B00005JMOW", "B00096S49Y", "0767847415", "6305313687", "B004SIP9Z6", "B0047T74CM", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B000R4SMCW", "B0002YLCG0", "B000P0J0EW", "B000HEWEE4", "B0041KKYHE", "B00BBI7EZY", "B00AEBBA2W", "B000CQLZ0Q", "0783235070", "0767802519", "B002ZG997C", "B00003CXHG", "B004SIP7ZS", "B000069HZP", "B004SIP7PS", "B003ASLJQI", "B00177Y9ZC", "B00005JLKN", "B003ZW9H68", "B001N44BVQ", "B002O3Z50Q", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00005JN2Z", "B00AEBB86A", "B00000F4ZY", "B000MZHW40", "0671686402", "B00BB67UNW", "B005HP2J0M", "B000QXDED6", "B000NIVJF4", "B001F12J0C", "B000N6TX1I", "B000LAZE8C", "B00080ZG10", "B005LAIGRS", "B0009MDPYM", "0792159659", "B000OYC7BW", "B001UV4XGU", "B004AOECXI", "0767818105", "B000XR9L50", "B0018O4YT0", "B00015YVDG", "B004SIP8JI", "B00004XPPG", "B00006ZXSK", "B001DHXT20", "B0000AC8LR", "B009B8YMB0", "0783229402", "B0006210ZG", "B001PPGAIA", "B00004BZIY", "B008JFURII", "B00005JPAR", "B00006ADFM", "B004SIP7TE", "B000F5GNX8", "B000FS9FCG", "B006P0FIGU", "B00005JMCN", "B002VWNID6", "B004XQO90O", "B004EPZ084", "B00AEBB9M8", "B000P5FH3K", "B00005JNY3", "B000063US3", "B003L20IG0"], "bought_together": ["B000LC55F2", "B002ZG980U"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000LC55F2", "B005LAIHXQ", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00DV2MVWO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 60145}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.0, "brand": "Twentieth Century Fox", "asin": "B000K7VHPU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51nYghoS63L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Illusionist (Full Screen Edition)"}
{"description": "From the second season of Showtime's Masters of Horror series comes the next Dario Argento offering,Pelts, which is far creepier than his last attempted made-for-TV thrillers (Do You Like HitchcockandJenifer). Meatloaf stars as Jake, a sleazy furrier whose obsession for a lesbian stripper named Shannon results in his attempting to make the finest fur ever for her to wear at an upcoming fur trade show. John Saxon (Tenebre) plays a trapper who comes through for Jake by setting traps in sacred raccoon territory to capture the most beautiful animals imaginable. However, as these raccoons are magical guardians of a lost raccoon city, they curse all associated with the deaths of their brethren with the desire to commit gory suicides using techniques employed in the manufacturing of fur coats. Quite disgusting are scenes of a seamstress sewing her eyes and nose shut with thread, or of a man cutting his belly open with shears to gut himself. One can only infer what Jake's fate might be. The film's disturbing ambience is amplified when suicides occur in the skinning and tanning rooms of Jake's fur factory. Close-ups of the raccoons' faces and shots of their ancient city, which boasts raccoon-carved sculptures, remind one of the absurdity of magical raccoons as crime instigators. But simultaneously the message ofPeltsis made clear.Peltswould make any PETA member proud, if not nauseous.--Trinie Dalton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000KJTFB6", "B000NY0YJA", "B000LPS47K", "B000S1MMCU", "B000OYCMO4", "B000UR9QXK", "B000S1MMCK", "B000PWQP9I", "B000RL21PO", "B000RL21OK", "B000WC38FU", "B000UYX4P4", "B000FS2W3A", "B000RIWAV2", "B000GI3RHY", "B000E5KUME", "B000E5KUMO", "B000F3UACK", "B000WC384Q", "B000UVV22O", "B001AR0D6I", "B000GB5M2Y", "B000FA57WG", "B000RL21N6", "B000UYX4PO", "B00DOZNGTK", "B001QMCJ0U", "B002EP8FDI", "B000FS2W3K", "B000S0GYRK", "B00GSMZ3I8", "B0015D3YRM", "B008Y1YK7G", "B000FA57W6", "B004FUPK6U", "B00008WJD9", "B00GHH9IIA", "B000S0GYRU", "B000RL21NG", "B000GB5M2O", "B0002C9DK4", "B001B187L6", "B005SQRYB4", "B003NEQ74S", "B002ZG98C8", "B00HW3EZXQ", "B002LMSWN2", "B000E1P2EY", "B00009MEC4", "B008DVJOQY", "B000F3UACU", "B000ERVKLW", "B000X1RYEQ", "B000TZJCMS", "B000274TLW", "1578482542", "B000UVV22E", "B003Q6D246", "B001LIK8DO", "B000S0GYS4", "B004KDYR20", "B0010X73ZG", "B004JHYTH0", "B004JHYTHK", "B0030E5PYO", "B004KDYR1G", "B00005UQ7N", "B003VE9WU6", "B00CPTUNUG", "B0057YUV6C", "B001MEJY8W", "B000SULWKO", "B00A429Y56", "B006BZ8NSE", "B00125WATQ", "B008HSK3PE", "B00153ZR8G", "B000GYI340", "B001C0NMU2", "B00CLIAACC", "B000CEXF5Q", "B004QLX0PQ", "B000Q66Q8I", "B0028DRGDQ", "B008HUSFYS", "B002FICQFM", "B002ZG98KK", "B00000JT2R", "B001UDS4CC", "B008DVJOQ4", "B0091G7BTM", "B000A6T1ZY", "B0009WFEDC", "B001D5C1R6", "B001DJ7KHS", "B00E5S2HGS", "B000RPCJA2", "B00005KH30", "B00ARWX9NG"], "bought_together": ["B000KJTFB6", "B000NY0YJA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000RIWAV2", "B000FS2W3A", "B000KJTFB6", "B000NY0YJA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 65019}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 8.84, "brand": "STARZ/SPHE", "asin": "B000KJTFBG", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51mO%2BjHdxiL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Masters of Horror: Pelts"}

{"description": "Believing in oneself can be difficult, even with the support of friends.  The formerly wingless fairy Elina has saved Fairytopia more than once, proving herself against Fungus Maximus and turning the evil Laverna into a frog inBarbie FairytopiaandBarbie Fairytopia--Mermaidia, but she still questions her own abilities when Guardian Azura selects her to become her apprentice and learn the all-important flight of spring--a ritual which ensures another year of vitality in Fairytopia.  The taunts and snobby attitudes of her fellow apprentices serve to further undercut Elina's self-esteem, but she vows to do her best to master the flight of spring and soon proves worthy of her appointment.  When the trickery of Laverna threatens to stop the flight of spring and destroy Fairytopia forever, it falls to the new apprentices to save Fairytopia.  Of course, Elina will play a pivotal role in the group's eventual success or failure.  Prepubescent attitudes and shallowness reign among most of the apprentices, but most eventually see the error of their ways and the clear message is the importance of believing in oneself.

{"description": "Flushed Awayis a rip-roaring nautical adventure with a twist: The heroes are a pair of rodents braving the sewers underneath London. Roddy (voiced by Hugh Jackman) is an upper-crust house-mouse who finds himself flushed into the subterranean sewers. Eager to return to his posh home, he enlists the help of a boat-captain rat named Rita (Kate Winslet), who has troubles of her own; namely the kingpin of the underworld, the Toad (Ian McKellen), and his henchmen including the French mercenary Le Frog (Jean Reno).While technicallyFlushed Awaycould be considered part of the wave of celebrity-voiced, anthropomorphic-animal movies that hit in 2005-2006 (Madagascar,Over the Hedge,The Wild, etc.), it doesn't inspire the same sense of d&#xE9;j&#xE0; vu. For one thing, its voice actors are less recognizable than the likes of Bruce Willis and Chris Rock. For another, its look is very distinctive. Like Nick Park'sChicken RunandWallace and Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit, it's a joint production of DreamWorks Animation and Aardman Features, and although Park isn't involved, it retains his trademark blocky look of clay animation. But animating the movie by computer rather than by hand allows for some eye-popping tableaux, such as floodwaters rushing through the sewers and an entire town of little animated characters. It's a crazy thrill ride loaded with inside jokes and enough crude humor to earn a PG rating, and the band of singing slugs is also a hoot.--David HoriuchiOn the DVDIt's no surprise that the singing slugs are the stars of the DVD's bonus features. They're featured in two music videos (less than a minute total), and in a 13-minute segment an Aardman animator builds a slug out of plasticine.  (In contrast, the lesson on drawing Roddy is a mere two minutes.) A song jukebox jumps to 10 musical points in the film, though the non-slug background music isn't really worth the jump. On the human side, there are eight-minute featurettes on the music and the voices, a set-top game that is easier to control than most such featurettes (and easier to beat too), and a commentary track by directors David Bowers and Sam Fell in which they have a grand old time remembering their inside jokes and showering love on the Spike and Whitey characters. The DVD-ROM has access to 21 more online games.--David HoriuchiFun Facts fromFlushed AwayIn Tabitha's room, there are a variety of dolls from previous DreamWorks Animation films, including a Gromit and several bunnies fromWallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,an Alex the Lion fromMadagascar,and a Dragon fromShrek.Many characters from past films make cameos inFlushed Away.For example, aChicken Runchicken is on the second page of the Toad&#x92;s scrapbook, Gromit&#x92;s head is a pencil top in the Jammy Dodger, the penguin fromWallace and Gromit: The Wrong Trousersis on a stamp on the Jammy Dodger, and a poster ofWallace and Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbitis on the side of a bus in Kensington.There are officially 60 million rats in the UK.  That&#x92;s one rat for every person.The various boats in the film are made up of flotsam and jetsam that rats could conceivably find in the sewer.For the double decker bus:Ice chest, retro flipping numbers alarm clock, bike lamp, buckle, oil drum, soup can, license plate, rope, plastic suitcase, jerry can.For the mini cooper: Soda can, battery,  sardine can, butter knife, old lights.Simulating the toilet water and making it look realistic proved to be a challenge.  After much consideration, it was finally discovered that what was missing was caustics, or the use of light reflection off the bottom of the bowl.  This was added and everyone was happy because they could finally get their mind out of the toilet.Stills fromFlushed Away(click for larger image)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0012EM5D8", "B0006JMLRK", "B00003CXJ4", "B00005JNQS", "B002WJI2QQ", "B001DPHDCY", "B001U3D88M", "B0000640SC", "B000H7JCK0", "B00CWM58WY", "B004HO6I4M", "B005SDUV4E", "0783231474", "B001PR0YEE", "B004EPZ034", "B001GCUO7A", "B000RMJ4F8", "B0006UEVT0", "B001LPWGFA", "B000CZ0PT4", "B00029LO0Y", "B000BITUVG", "B000MV9026", "B000ION23A", "B000L22SG6", "B000UVKGPI", "B004AKCME8", "B000DWMYQ8", "B000065V42", "B000MNOX9E", "B000EQ5UHS", "6305161887", "B003UESJF6", "B001ECQ75A", "B000UFIYOO", "B005LAIISA", "B00B7EQPNE", "B00CHVJODE", "B001FTIJS0", "B0000AOX0O", "B002ZG97YM", "B007FF3HQM", "B00003CXG7", "B00E00OGE2", "B004SIPAFK", "B001LXIDTA", "B006JD48LO", "B00E9ZATJO", "B005LAIIT4", "B009AMAH3O", "B00000JL8E", "B00000JGOQ", "B0000VV4W2", "B003E66Y84", "B00EBBGLFC", "B004LWZW7Y", "B001OMU6UM", "B00005JM7T", "B002UOMH00", "B008JFUQ16", "0783219806", "B000IFRT2O", "B005QODEEE", "B001HN6918", "B00007LVCM", "B000GUJZ00", "B00HLTD2OE", "B00005JMFH", "B001NCDFTW", "B001GCUNWQ", "B000G75AZC", "B00JK531ES", "B005LAIIHG", "B0046A9RMM", "B000AY74OG", "B008R65XPQ", "B001NLJ3RG", "B00009YXAW", "B00GRZPQCO", "B001RXDM36", "B0034G4P26", "B004OWQTZ0", "B0052XI5J8", "B0034G4OYA", "B0044RFTCO", "B006VUYJ00", "B001LXIDTK", "B008NNY9QW", "B00LG6YEKE", "B00028HBES", "B000P0J09W", "B000VBJEEG", "B00I6JOD2S", "B0039N74CW", "B00ALMNCLQ", "B001SXZ7T2", "B00CWM5MDY", "B000ROAK2W", "B00AEBB8KQ"], "bought_together": ["B004HO6I4M", "B00CWM58WY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002WJI2QQ", "B004HO6I4M", "B00CWM58WY", "B00003CXJ4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 5311}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.85, "brand": "Dreamworks", "asin": "B000M343BC", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51PGB5ZeCfL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Flushed Away (Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "Brilliantly conceived, superbly directed, and beautifully acted,Babelis inarguably one of the best films of 2006. Director Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu and his co-writer, Guillermo Arriaga (the two also collaborated onAmores Perrosand21 Grams) weave together the disparate strands of their story into a finely hewn fabric by focusing on what appear to be several equally incongruent characters: an American (Brad Pitt) touring Morocco with his wife (Cate Blanchett) become the focus of an international incident also involving a hardscrabble Moroccan farmer (Mustapha Rachidi) struggling to keep his two young sons in line and his family together. A San Diego nanny (Adriana Barraza), her employers absent, makes the disastrous decision to take their kids with her to a wedding in Mexico. And a deaf-mute Japanese teen (the extraordinary Rinko Kikuchi) deals with a relationship with her father (Koji Yakusho) and the world in general that's been upended by the death of her mother. It is perhaps not surprising, or particularly original, that a gun is the device that ties these people together. YetBabelisn't merely about violence and its tragic consequences. It's about communication, and especially the lack of it--both intercultural, raising issues like terrorism and immigration, and intracultural, as basic as husbands talking to their wives and parents understanding their children. I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu's command of his medium, sound and visual alike, is extraordinary; the camera work is by turns kinetic and restrained, the music always well matched to the scenes, the editing deft but not confusing, and the film (which clocks in at a lengthy 143 minutes) is filled with indelible moments. Many of those moments are also pretty stark and grim, and no will claim that all of this leads to a \"happy\" ending, but there is a sense of reconciliation, perhaps even resolution. \"If You Want to be Understood... Listen,\" goes the tagline. And if you want a movie that will leave you thinking,Babelis it.--Sam GrahamBeyondBabelOther Interweaving Storylines on DVDOther DVDs by Director Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rrituWhy We Love Cate BlanchettStills fromBabel(click for larger image)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0001CNRRU", "B00005N8A9", "B0041KKYF6", "B000A3XY5A", "B000F7CMRM", "B000067IZ3", "B00005JL57", "B00AEFXESQ", "B001P9KR8U", "B000N6TX1I", "B001JIE7JC", "B00005JPKE", "B00AEFXQ9S", "B00005JMJ4", "B0010DR4BO", "B000NIVJF4", "B000NIVJFY", "B000F1IQN2", "B00HF98SPS", "B0045ZAQRS", "B00011CZRE", "B000N3T0DW", "B002O3Z4Z2", "B000MZHW40", "B004SIP6VI", "B0034G4P30", "B008JFUNKU", "B003ASLJQS", "B000E1NXJ0", "B004SIP6GI", "B00AEBB89W", "B00275EGWY", "B000IONJM4", "B00H9KKGTO", "B00003CWTI", "B00080Z53O", "B00005JNCZ", "B00114XTHA", "B00GUO2SKA", "B00112S8RS", "B001PPLJIQ", "B000MXPE7O", "B00102F5WK", "B00121QGPY", "B0016Q2D66", "B002J1RZHE", "B008220DGE", "B000O76ZQC", "B0013XZ6X4", "B00080ZG10", "B00337KM2S", "B000286RP2", "B004SIP8ZM", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00005JMJG", "B00005Q4CS", "B00AEBB9CS", "B00G4Q3KOC", "B0036TGSJE", "B001TOD92C", "B000OY8NBK", "B004XVMCKS", "B00GMV8M2Y", "B00005JLRE", "B00005JH9M", "B00004WG2F", "B00AEBB8SS", "B00005JKJA", "B00H9HZITU", "B000YENUI6", "B0041KKYDI", "B001MZ5W3M", "B000N3SU92", "B000EQHXNW", "B0041KKYEM", "B001LLH8SE", "B0007TKOAA", "B000P0J0BK", "B002S5N052", "B004SIP7S0", "B00AEBB8NI", "B002SJIO4A", "B000CQLZ0Q", "B000E33VWW", "B000M341QE", "B002VWNICC", "B001NFNFNU", "6305313687", "B00005JKTF", "B00FZ4KR4U", "B00008K7AO", "B00DL48BM6", "079073639X", "B00H83EUQW", "B000FVQLRA", "B0002TT0MI", "B00AHTYI5M", "B00H9L26AA", "B00003CWRX", "B002FHGESI"], "bought_together": ["B00005N8A9", "B0041KKYF6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000A3XY5A", "B0001CNRRU", "B0041KKYF6", "B00G4Q3KOC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 100262}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.22, "brand": "Paramount Home Video", "asin": "B000MCH5P4", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51poif023LL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Babel"}
