{"description": "You know that old dramatic principle of suspension of disbelief? You'll have to rely on it for this box-office smash, but you won't be disappointed. Harrison Ford plays a U.S. president who single-handedly employs his rigid antiterrorism policy when a band of Russian thugs hatch a mid-flight takeover of Air Force One. Gary Oldman, who chews the scenery as the lead terrorist, will shoot a hostage at the slightest provocation. Glenn Close plays the sternly pragmatic vice president who negotiates with Oldman from her Washington seat of power. If you can believe that the aircraft's pressurized cabin can sustain hundreds of rounds of machine-gun fire, you'll buy anything in this entertaining potboiler, especially thanks to Ford's stalwart heroics and some nifty special effects. Director Wolfgang Petersen (Das Boot) keeps the action moving so fast you won't be sweating the details. Don't forget your parachute!--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0045HCJFS", "B00005ATZT", "B004IK30MI", "B00008K76V", "B001ECDVK4", "B00008K76W", "B00008G8M4", "6304806434", "0790736411", "B000JYW5BE", "B00000G3PA", "6304711891", "0783225733", "B00AEBB9UK", "B0006GANOQ", "B00008K76U", "B00026ZG10", "0783225547", "6304765258", "B00005JL8F", "B000QUCRB4", "B0002V7OI8", "B002AT8KA6", "6305213283", "B00441GYZQ", "B00AEFXT1S", "B00AEFYXJ0", "B00015YVDG", "B00004STDN", "B00AEFY4CG", "B00AEFXKZ8", "B000ENC5YW", "B000F8DV1M", "B002GHHHME", "B00081U7HC", "B00009WVSL", "0790732149", "B00AEBB8YW", "6305428115", "6304765266", "B003ASLJIQ", "B0007IO6NM", "B002NZK5UU", "B0000AOV4I", "B00AEBBA2W", "B000055Y0Y", "B00E8G5HQE", "0783240295", "B001ECDVJU", "0800141601", "B0002WZTOI", "B00AEFYENK", "B000FO0AA6", "B001VLBDD0", "B000O77SRC", "B00008G6E8", "B001UDS4BS", "0783223609", "B001B3LIOC", "B002O3Z50G", "0783235070", "6305236569", "B00AEFY0F2", "B007FQXEWI", "B00AEBB9WI", "076780676X", "B00001ZWUS", "B00005JA9F", "B00005N5S5", "B00004Z4WR", "B00L4K450G", "B003AWRMBA", "B002AT8KAG", "B0000DIXDR", "B0045HCJ8K", "B00AEFYF2K", "B002GIBVVG", "0783226934", "B000YDBPAM", "0783227396", "B007SPPANM", "6305133476", "0783225504", "B00005LB88", "B000P0J0EW", "B000CEV3M8", "B0014Z4ON4", "6304602944", "B000O78KW4", "B000P0J0EM", "B002GHHHNI", "B00000ILDD", "B00003CXFV", "B00005B6JZ", "B00004XPPG", "B00003CXTG", "B00005N5SA", "0790732238", "B002AS464Q", "0767811100"], "bought_together": ["B0045HCJFS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000YCPUWW", "B00008K76W", "B00005ATZT", "B00004XPPG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 1368}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.76, "brand": "Columbia/Tristar Studios", "asin": "0767803434", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51YGCZNXA9L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Air Force One"}
{"description": "For all of its conventional plotting about an obsessive-compulsive curmudgeon (Jack Nicholson) who improves his personality at the urging of his gay neighbor (Greg Kinnear) and a waitress (Helen Hunt) who inspires his best behavior, this is one of the sharpest Hollywood comedies of the 1990s. Nicholson could play his role in his sleep (the Oscar he won should have gone to Robert Duvall forThe Apostle), but his mischievous persona is precisely necessary to give heart to his seemingly heartless character, who is of all things a successful romance novelist. As a single mom with a chronically asthmatic young son, Hunt gives the film its conscience and integrity (along with plenty of wry humor), and she also won an Oscar for her wonderful performance. Greg Kinnear had to settle for an Oscar nomination (while cowriter-director James L. Brooks was inexplicably snubbed by Oscar that year), but his work was also singled out in the film's near-unanimous chorus of critical praise. It's questionable whether a romance between Hunt and the much older Nicholson is entirely believable, but this movie's smart enough--and charmingly funny enough--to make it seem endearingly possible.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0001AVZA8", "B000YAF4MA", "0800141741", "B004FQX5B6", "B0000YEEGM", "B0038N9WKU", "B000FVQLQQ", "B00AEBB9WI", "B00005JLSK", "0783226845", "B0000AOV4I", "B000YDBPAM", "B000XJD33O", "B004SIP7ZS", "B00081U7HC", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00AEBB8YW", "B00003CXFV", "B001ECDVK4", "6305212112", "B000EHRVOW", "B00009Y3PV", "6304765266", "B00004RJ73", "B005F2JRUC", "0783225733", "B00AEFXYOA", "6305236569", "B000OCZA04", "B000FFJYBG", "B003ASLJK4", "0792833198", "B000JYW5B4", "B00012QLB4", "B00BTYRB3U", "B0043X1FL8", "B000055Y0Y", "B00005B6JZ", "B000EHQU0S", "B00AEBB9UK", "B00008G7UF", "B0002B15ZG", "B00005JG6N", "B001MBTTNA", "B001ECDVJU", "B00003CWQR", "B00AEFY4CG", "630471193X", "B002GHHHP6", "B00AEBB9NM", "B0000A02TZ", "0767821769", "B00569I5BQ", "B00AEFYSWM", "B00AEFXYJA", "B000XT1P3E", "B002GHHHGU", "B00026ZG10", "6305128952", "B00005OLYF", "B001LMAK9W", "B000N6U0E2", "B000EMGJ7C", "B000023VTP", "B00CPTUOI2", "B004SIP9U6", "B00001ZWUS", "B003BV8ICC", "B0043X1FM2", "B0013XZ2QK", "B00AEFXT1S", "B00AEBB9FA", "B007SPPANM", "B00005JM4Q", "B007N31YH0", "B000VECAD0", "B00003CXO1", "B00009WVSL", "B00003CXSM", "B000NA1WDQ", "B00004BZIY", "B002AS464Q", "B000J103OI", "B000021Y7L", "B000ENC5YW", "B0002V7ON8", "B00009W5CA", "B00015YVDG", "B0009X75O2", "B0000JBALO", "0767803434", "6305065551", "B000MQC9H4", "6305692572", "B00013RC2U", "6305144168", "B00008979G", "B000CCBCAS", "0792846443", "B000M341QE"], "bought_together": ["B0001AVZA8", "B000YAF4MA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0001AVZA8", "B0038N9WKU", "B000YAF4MA", "B00013WWT8"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 5469}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.96, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "0767811100", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51KRRMHSAJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "As Good As It Gets"}

{"description": "Robert Crumb is known for his disturbing, yet compelling, underground cartoons: his most famous works made countercultural icons out of Mr. Natural (\"Keep on Truckin'...\") and Fritz the Cat. Terry Zwigoff delves into the odd world of the cartoonist in his documentary filmCrumb, and the picture that emerges is not always pretty--at moments, it's almost repellent--but it's a fascinating glimpse into a very strange mind. Interviewing immediate family--Crumb has one suicidal brother, one semi-psychopathic brother, two sisters who declined to be interviewed, and a tyrannical mother--Crumb begins to look a bit saner. Given his surroundings, it's remarkable that he has survived so well. His hostilities toward women may turn some viewers off, but his wife, Aline, seems to be a grounding point, and she provides a solid counterbalance to the man.  No one shies away from discussing incredibly intimate things (namely, sex!), which explains much of R. Crumb's cartoons.

{"description": "Spencer Tracy's last performance was in this well-meaning, handsome film by Stanley Kramer about a pair of white parents (Tracy and Katharine Hepburn) trying to make sense of their daughter's impending marriage to an African American doctor (Sidney Poitier). The film has been knocked over the years for padding conflict and stoking easy liberalism by making Poitier's character in every socioeconomic sense a good catch: But what if Kramer had made this stranger a factory worker? Would the audience still find it as easy to accept a mixed-race relationship? But there's no denying the drawing power of this movie, which gets most of its integrity from the stirring performances of Tracy and Hepburn. When the former (who had been so ill that the production could not get completion insurance) gives a speech toward the end about race, love, and much else, it's impossible not to be affected by the last great moment in a great actor's life and career.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000068Z8", "B000006N70", "6301586042", "B000056BRF", "630018224X", "630273973X", "630150528X", "0800104803", "6305126062", "0783222955", "6301969405", "0792841859", "6301586026", "6304239149", "630396155X"], "bought_together": ["B0000068Z8"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 198364}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.97, "brand": "", "asin": "0767825616", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71BTRTM71CL._SY300_.gif", "title": "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner [VHS]"}

Cary Grant is the stranger who comes to her aid, but his real motives aren't entirely clear--could he even be the killer?

Cernan, the most philosophical of the 12 moonwalkers, discusses at length the life-altering experience of space travel.

{"description": "This gritty 1997 film marks the merging of several budding talents: sisters Sylvia and Alex Sichel, who serve as writer and director, and actors Alison Folland (To Die For), Tara Subkoff, and Murmurs singer  Leisha Hailey. The idea behind the movie was the Sichels' awe at ever having  survived being teenage girls in the big city.All Over Meis about Claude (Folland) a shy, overweight teen who works in a pizza parlor after school and is secretly in love with her best friend Ellen (Subkoff). But Ellen is far ahead of Claude in development. She has an older boyfriend, and she harbors a bad case of destructive self-loathing that erupts frequently and with a fury. ButAll Over Meisn't just a teenage cautionary or coming-out tale. It's as much a story of New York and its unbearably long, hot summers as it is the downtown music scene or teenage dreams and struggles with adult issues. More than that, it's a well-made film that has its own rhythm,  working slowly to give us insight into the girls' natures. It succeeds admirably  in taking us back to that age when everything seemed possible despite the dangers of the city closing in. Growing up has never felt as close to home or as scarily realistic.--Paula Nechak", "price": 14.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 464576}, "asin": "0780619544", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51CQES2ZMFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "All Over Me [VHS]"}
{"description": "The Mack, a 1973 pimping epic, is at once a laughable, schlock classic and a harbinger of more serious black-themed films to come. Starring the now-forgotten Max Julien as Goldie, the preening ex-con whose dream is to rule the streets with a fine Cadillac and a fleet of topnotch hookers, this film is full of whip-crack, mostly improvised dialogue and hilarious stereotypes (the evil white cops, a wisdom-spouting blind man, and more trash-talkin' pimps than you could shake a walking stick at).Not only is the film one you can chuckle at in the postmodern, ironic mode, it is also a window on the world of today's rap superstars, many of whom have sampled, invoked, or quoted lines from this gaudy paean to pandering. In other words,The Mackis a kind of godfather to a future stark frankness about life on the streets. But forget the sociological hooey and dig into the piece as an urban costume picture with a greasy/funky score by R&B; genius Willie Hutch.Also, it features an amazing supporting turn by Richard Pryor, who, playing Tonto to Julien's Lone Ranger, unleashes torrents of nearly incomprehensible verbiage in the film's finest moments. Mind you, such brilliance is a direct comedy-organ transplant from Pryor's stand-up act: he was performing his \"Pimp on Blow\" routine at about the same timeThe Mackwas filmed. Seventy percent of this piece is dross, but the other 30 is the apex of urban surrealism. One vignette to tantalize: Goldie hypnotizing his \"ladies\" into docile submission as they sit in a planetarium, mechanically repeating his words: \"I will remain a lady at all times...\"--David Was", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300269167", "B000053VBA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 401532}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.85, "brand": "", "asin": "078060959X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51F7Q516CVL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Mack [VHS]"}
{"description": "Based on a Serbo-Croation story, this film by Alan Wade is set in rural Appalachia and stars Christian Slater as a suicidal stranger whose car breaks down on a long pilgrimage to the ocean. The locals greet him with suspicion, but when they find out that he has death on his mind, he becomes a local celebrity, treated with kindness and made a confidante of many who have troubles to share. The irony is that this rise in esteem is exactly the antidote to his self-destructive urges--but will these good people understand if he changes his mind? Wade's low-key approach is a good choice for this character-driven story, but his portrayal of rural types is a bit tainted by the clich&eacute;s of TV'sNorthern ExposureandDoc Hollywood, stories where small-town folk are automatically eccentric. Still, this is a pleasant enough film about a highly unusual subject.--Tom Keogh", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 754068}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.94, "brand": "", "asin": "0780620879", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51M4HJVQZTL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Julian Po [VHS]"}
{"description": "Both loved and reviled, Ronald \"Dutch\" Reagan rose out of the political ashes of Watergate to become one of the most popular presidents in American history.  Whether you like it or not, he will be remembered along with Franklin Delano Roosevelt and John F. Kennedy as one of the most influential and charismatic political figures of the 20th century. This epic four-and-a-half-hour documentary shows why, and it benefits greatly from the fact that many of the participants in the documented events are still alive. Tape 1 chronicles his troubled childhood with an alcoholic father, his years as a lifeguard, his eventual stardom in Hollywood, his governorship of California, and his election to the presidency in 1980. Tape 2 picks up shortly after the assassination attempt and takes off as it explains his policy toward the \"evil empire.\" Surprising to some will be the news that privately Reagan abhorred nuclear weapons and feared Armageddon, but he firmly believed that the United States could only negotiate from a position of strength (during his administration Pentagon spending reached $34 million an hour). Long but never boring, this film is a tribute to a man infinitely more complex than the jellybean-eating figurehead many like to portray him as. Included are interviews with Mikhail Gorbachev, Margaret Thatcher, Nancy Reagan, and those wacky Reagan kids.--Kristian St. Clair", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00003A9RS", "B000BITUKC", "B00652U70A"], "also_viewed": ["B0006Z2L74", "B0021H39C6"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 355922}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 9.94, "brand": "", "asin": "0780621549", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51BVC4289VL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The American Experience - Ronald Reagan [VHS]"}
{"description": "Woody Allen roared back at his detractors withDeconstructing Harry, a bitterly funny treatise about the creative process. Known to mine his often tumultuous personal life for his movies, the embattled writer-director-star didn't bother to make his alter ego likable in this movie: Harry Block (Allen) pops pills, frequents prostitutes, and cheats on the women in his life, then writes about their foibles in thinly disguised fiction. No wonder they're all furious with him. As Harry journeys to his alma mater with a hooker, ill pal, and kidnapped son, a series of flashbacks unravel, juxtaposing Harry's relationships with their \"slightly exaggerated\" fictional counterparts. There are amusing cameos throughout, including a humorous turn by Demi Moore as a fictitious ex-wife who \"became Jewish with a vengeance,\" and Billy Crystal as the devil who found Hollywood too nasty for his liking. The humor is dark and caustic, but well worth it;Deconstructing Harryis a near-brilliant mediation on the sometimes queasy relationship between art, creator, and critic.--Diane Garrett", "related": {"also_bought": ["0767819764", "B000062XE6", "6304039166", "630450392X", "B00000JGOI", "6305291470", "6301972147", "B00005AUJK", "630146494X", "B00005O06J", "6305327068", "1439193886", "B002LMV7RA", "B003TRMLQM", "B00005O06K", "6305428085", "B005MYEQ4U", "B00004WI55", "B0009ALSFW", "6303011411"], "bought_together": ["6304039166"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 288551}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 10.0, "brand": "", "asin": "0780621654", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5165BZZNQ0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Deconstructing Harry [VHS]"}

{"description": "The best way to enjoy this 1997 thriller is to forget the much better film that inspired it (1973'sThe Day of the Jackal) and get whatever kicks you can from this heavy-metal remake. It's not bad as hokey thrillers go, but all of the original film's suspenseful finesse has been traded in (not traded up) for bigger, bolder action and nonsensical plotting. It's as if Hollywood had forgotten to create excitement without resorting to overblown action and heavy hardware, but there's ample compensation in the casting of Bruce Willis and Richard Gere. Willis is the elusive assassin known only as the Jackal, whose latest target (he uses a cannon-sized gun that's anything but inconspicuous) may be the first lady of the United States. Gere plays a former IRA terrorist who is recruited by the deputy head of the FBI (Sidney Poitier) to trace the Jackal's maneuvers, and Diane Venora offers some gutsy support as a Russian-born agent who assists Gere on his mission. The movie has fun turning Willis into a master of disguise, and Gere adds much-needed gravity to counter the plot's escalating absurdity, but this is the kind of film that falls apart if you think about it too much.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00000IO4G", "6304258984", "0792147618", "0783202253", "B00003CXUX", "0792133153", "6303696813", "B00003G1FZ", "6301697758", "B00004WIDB", "6301208773", "0792116887", "076781956X", "B00003JRAB", "6302945089", "B0002GTWOM", "B00007CVYA", "6305718792", "B000059XYK", "6303313345", "6300183211", "0800125762", "6302842476", "0800199421", "078322530X", "079212569X", "6304214502", "6305622825", "6303269834", "0800178394", "B00003BE3X", "B00004RVRP", "630300394X", "6303486746", "6304826133", "6304259131", "B00003CXN3", "0790748169", "6305171750", "6303447589", "630470786X", "0793927501", "630348431X", "0783222955", "B00003OSSM", "6301071379", "079213690X", "0790731274", "0790731975", "B000006FNX", "6303383300", "6303953425", "B00005A7VC", "079073799X", "0790733927", "B00005JKIO", "6305368139"], "bought_together": ["B00000IO4G"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 435268}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.25, "brand": "", "asin": "0783223218", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515MWW5PDEL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Jackal  [VHS]"}

{"description": "After a career slump that plagued him through most of the 1980s, Al Pacino made a stellar comeback in this taut 1989 thriller, playing a weary New York police detective who falls in love with the woman (Ellen Barkin) who is the prime suspect in the murder case he's investigating. Expertly written by Richard Price and directed by Harold Becker, the story is designed to keep its central characters (and the viewer) in a state of constant suspicion and arousal--an emotional combination that sends dangerous sparks flying between Pacino and Barkin. Their chemistry is intense, and their love scenes are some of the hottest of any movie of its decade. ButSea of Loveis not merely concerned with cheap titillation. It's a riveting whodunit with scenes of nail-biting suspense and memorable dialogue that make it as interesting to listen to as it is to watch. Barkin had made a similarly sexy impression inThe Big Easy, and here she gives one of the best performances of her underrated career, matching Pacino's excellence scene for scene. The ending's a bit of a letdown because the murder solution comes somewhat out of the blue, but it's the acting and suspense that you'll remember most--qualities that makeSea of Loveone of the best films of its kind.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305262268", "B0043X1FNQ", "B00BTYRB3U", "B000HC2LHG", "B00008L3S6", "B00441GYPG", "0783226845", "B00AEBB95K", "B00000K3TU", "B00013RC66", "6305308837", "6305310335", "B0000AM6JI", "B00AEFXX9Q", "B0045HCJIK", "B0043X1FKY", "B003LR5BD0", "B004SUDQ1S", "6305065551", "B000E5N684", "B00000JGHL", "B000A9QK6E", "B000CNESTE", "B00004XPPB", "0790730979", "B000CBCWRG", "B000P0J0AG", "B00005K3NU", "B00AEFYD9K", "B00005JLX2", "0792844874", "B00127RAGC", "B002AS463W", "B0015OKWL2", "B002AT8KAG", "B0002T7YQW", "B000C20VRS", "6305213305", "079073219X", "B0009GX1CO", "B00AEFYC96", "B000H5TH1Q", "B0045HCJ8K", "B00009Y3PV", "B00441GYOM", "B00000J11D", "B000LP6KMQ", "0767810872", "B00005U2KC", "B00009WVSL", "B000EQ5SRK", "B00AEFYD2M", "B004YCKKFK", "B00015YVDG", "B00AEFXN9G", "B00003CWRX", "B00BLF9FYA", "B00AEBB9N2", "B00005JO5L", "B00005K3NV", "B000069HZP", "B00AEFXT1S", "B00AEFXIIW", "B00AEBB9EG", "6305428484", "B001NY4WYC", "B000059TGB", "B00006RCNY", "B002VWNICC", "B00AEFXG2U", "B00006L91I", "B006GVN05O", "B000087F6M", "B000UGBOT0", "B00AEFXKZ8", "B003AWRMA6", "B001TK80D4", "B002NZK5RI", "076782170X", "B000A9QK5K", "B00005OLYF", "0767817729", "B004499LX0", "B0001US62I", "B000GNOSDG", "B0006GANN2", "B00005JLJW", "B00005JMIJ", "B00AEFXBPM", "B0006HBZBK", "B00AEFYW64", "B00007G1YQ", "B0001FGBW0", "B000FO0AA6", "B003INBNOS", "0767802616", "B000A2UBN4"], "bought_together": ["6305262268", "B000HC2LHG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00C7MW53E", "6305262268", "B000HC2LHG", "0783226845"]}, "price": 33.0, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 231594}, "asin": "0783226918", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51G3SG0CZAL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Sea of Love"}

{"description": "When attorney Julie Hastings (Frances McDormand) uncovers corrupt city real estate dealings, evil thugs attack her scientist boyfriend, Peyton Westlake (Liam Neeson). Left for dead after his lab is detonated, he miraculously survives when the ensuing blast hurls him into the nearby harbor. Treated as a John Doe at a city hospital, he is unknowingly submitted to radical therapy which numbs his nerves to feeling--but which heightens his strength and his emotions. Once conscious, Peyton escapes from the hospital and builds a ramshackle lab in an abandoned industrial plant. Horribly burned and scarred by the lab explosion, he uses synthetic skin to impersonate his would-be murderers and seek retribution for their evil deeds. Peyton also tries to reunite with Julie, who believes him to be dead. While the film has an average script, it is overcome by the flashy cinematography of Bill Pope, the bombastic score by Danny Elfman, and the well-choreographed direction of Sam Raimi. The director confidently walks the line between suspense, action, comedy, and romance as he examines a bitter, victimized antihero who risks becoming as monstrous on the inside as he appears on the outside.--Bryan Reesman", "related": {"also_bought": ["078323046X", "078321958X", "B0003JANT6", "B00BTYMPUY", "B0007PALZ2", "B003498SCQ", "078322799X", "B0009X768W", "B00005N7Z1", "B0002J58HO", "6305428514", "B00003CXQA", "B002AS466O", "B0009PVZD2", "B005LAIIRQ", "B001R3YRG2", "B0009X76XC", "B004A8ZX28", "B0015XHQT4", "B00AEFXCLU", "B0085A9HU6", "B000RW3VCK", "B00005JLWN", "B00007AJG4", "B00005K3NR", "0783225520", "B001F7MSFM", "079284646X", "B00008L3UM", "B002O3Z4ZW", "B0000A9GHD", "1558908846", "B00004Y87O", "B00FQPLZ08", "B000OVLBHG", "B001J710Y8", "0767802454", "B0001Z37HM", "0783227434", "0783229402", "B00026ZG10", "B00008G8LY", "6304698747", "B005J9ZFQG", "B000PMFRZQ", "B0045HCJGC", "0767821629", "0767817710", "B000NOIVT0", "B001JFZ118", "B001B43IVW", "B00005JKWJ", "B00005N5RM", "B000068IEV", "B0045HCJG2", "0783223609", "B0007PALGG", "B0024FADD8", "078401132X", "6304723113", "B0001VTPW2", "B00000ILDD", "6305767866", "079283366X", "B001TODCII", "B00005M2CO", "B00J2PQYYK", "B0067EKYAY", "B000FFJYAC", "B00BPEJWAE", "B002GHHHG0", "B002ZG994U", "B0007V6ITE", "B000MV8ABS", "B000NIBURQ", "B0040J1RX6", "B00001O2H0", "B004BZ5AN2", "0767815718", "B00003CXKA", "B003XURDAY", "0767811097", "B0002KVUKM", "B007ZC31R0", "B009AMAJPA", "0783226934", "B001FZQOW2", "B008G33PIM", "B0000UJL96", "B00004XMSC", "B00441GYZG", "B00DW5IKW0", "B003AWRM9W", "B00441GYXS", "B000031EG1", "0790729342", "B000NO1XJA", "B0090EDEM8", "B00007AJGH", "B003UGLCIA"], "bought_together": ["078323046X", "B0003JANT6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000PFUAP0", "078321958X", "6305841985", "B00GHH9IIA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 56997}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.86, "brand": "Universal", "asin": "0783226012", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51B63F94CML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Darkman"}

It's also got a cast full of enjoyable actors who clearly had a lot of fun making the film, and director Ron Underwood strikes just the right balance of comedy and terror as a band of small-town rednecks battles a lot of really nasty-looking giant worms. The special effects are great, the one-liners fly fast and furious between heroes Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward (and yes, that's country star Reba McEntire packin' awesome firepower), and it's all done with the kind of flair one rarely associates with goofy monster flicks like this.

{"description": "Clint Eastwood's stardom was supernova, thanks toDirty Harry; John Sturges, the man behindThe Magnificent Sevenand a dozen other memorably leathery Westerns, was directing; and Elmore Leonard was the screenwriter.  It just goes to show.Joe Kiddis a muddle and a drag, the shoddiest Eastwood vehicle since Rowdy Yates trod in his last cow flop.  Kidd, first seen as a duded-up drunk sleeping one off in jail, is supposed to be a horse rancher and an expert tracker--just the fellow a rapacious land-grabber (Robert Duvall committing lazy villainy) needs to chase down the uppity Latino (John Saxon) who's trying to reclaim the grabbed land for its rightful owners.

{"description": "When an unscrupulous real estate developer sends thugs into a deteriorating tenement to get rid of the last five tenants, they need nothing short of a miracle to stay where they are. In this delightful fantasy presented by Academy Award winner Steven Spielberg, little stands between the brave holdouts and the street. But one night, when all hope seems lost, tiny visitors from outer space mysteriously glide through their windows. As if in answer to their prayers, the incredible creatures begin to turn the tide with their magical powers. Filled with dazzling special effects, the amazing story of intergalactic warmth stars the acclaimed husband-and-wife team of Hume Cronyn and Jessica Tandy as a pair of feisty long-term tenants whose faith is rewarded in ways they never expected.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0001I562I", "B0064SVO9I", "B0000UJDLM", "B0024FADAQ", "B0043X1FOK", "B00079Z9Y6", "B00020HAWE", "B0001AW14C", "B00020HAV0", "B000P0J09W", "B001MWUWU8", "B000065V42", "B000MRNWKG", "B00DRQEU5A", "B000P0J0A6", "B0087F7VSY", "B000QXDCJ2", "B0002V7O3I", "B002NZK5SW", "6305428050", "B0025VLELQ", "B00005JG6M", "B0003JAONG", "B005QX8U2Q", "B001AGXEAG", "B0000648ZQ", "B00000K3D4", "B000BPL2GK", "B00028HBES", "B00HEEAMJO", "B00015HVM4", "B00015YVD6", "B002GHHHOM", "B00FAI3JE6", "B0014YVC6W", "B000089778", "B000031EGV", "B000068MC4", "B0001GOH84", "B00005T7HZ", "B001SXZ7T2", "B00AEBB9DW", "B00GJNQ4M0", "6305161887", "B0009RCPY8", "B004QSQMKE", "B008Y1YKOE", "B000Y11B7Q", "B000KGGIWI", "B00094ARVO", "B003CWEQFS", "B000065V43", "B0015NORDW", "B00009XUM5", "B00BTYSIWI", "B00000JPH6", "B00003CXC3", "B0002YCUR0", "B00006472U", "B00008979N", "B002NZK5TG", "B009Z5975A", "B000K7VHTQ", "B00AJCUL2G", "B0097A2LTW", "B00AMDA2O4", "078321958X", "B0012RWQJ8", "B000XKW2WG", "B000065V3H", "B008R65XKG", "B000FVQLM0", "B00AKGG6E8", "B000RJO56E", "B00ID3TPBQ", "B00E8G5HBY", "B00HEEAM3K", "B00005QT9P", "B000056WR3", "0783230079", "B0009HLD4Q", "B00000IQW2", "B00AEBB9E6", "B000NJMJGG", "B00AEFY4CG", "B001BGS17Q", "B005QX8UEE", "B007P9HW3M", "B004HZY8OS", "B00005JLJC", "B005F96UJ6", "B001CK1D44", "B00AEFXPG2", "0767812166", "B008H6GHEM", "B00005JMCW"], "bought_together": ["B0001I562I", "B0000UJDLM"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0001I562I", "B0000UJDLM", "B000MRNWKG", "B0043X1FOK"]}, "price": 4.88, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 2470}, "asin": "0783232047", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51KEKFWQN7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "*Batteries Not Included"}

The film includes a particularly harrowing contest involving a swim across the reservoir of a decrepit water tower; still, director Jon Avnet can't avoid a certain \"can't we all just get along\" didactic message.

{"description": "Two years before he let it all hang out inBoogie Nights, former rapper and Calvin Klein underwear model Mark Wahlberg played the psychotic boyfriend in this derivative but surprisingly effective thriller, aptly described by producer Brian Grazer as &quot;Fatal Attractionfor teens.&quot; Reese Witherspoon plays Nicole Walker, the unwitting teenager who gets the hots for David McCall (Wahlberg). David only seems like a nice guy until he gets upset by the girl's overly protective father. That's when hell breaks loose and the love-struck Romeo turns into a deadly threat who justwon'tgo away. You'd think this kind of material would be beneath the talents of a fine director like James Foley (whose credits includeAt Close RangeandGlengarry Glen Ross), but Foley gives the film just the right blend of style and tension to match Wahlberg's breakthrough role as an all-too-believable teenage maniac. You might feel silly afterwards, but don't be surprised if you find yourself getting caught up in the expertly manipulative suspense.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004P7CMVE", "0767818024", "B00AEFY0XE", "B000ZS8GWQ", "B000083C6I", "B00B83PJHM", "B00001PE4D", "B002GIBVVQ", "B001MTYRKC", "B00AEBB86A", "B000053VB2", "B000MMMTBY", "B005LAIGLE", "B001DZOC6Y", "B000U1ZV76", "B00BB67UNW", "6305213305", "B00004W4UD", "B000J3OTT6", "B00004RF85", "B00049QQHI", "B00000JGNP", "B00003CY5P", "B0000B1OFL", "157362554X", "B005LAII12", "B00441GYVK", "B00BEIYLO8", "B003UESJHO", "B00005JLIF", "B004P7CN7W", "B00005J761", "B00102F5WK", "B00006HAWN", "B00447L4KA", "B00009WVSL", "B002O3Z4Z2", "B00AEBBA2W", "B00AEFXT1S", "0767815718", "B00AEFXX9Q", "B000A5045Q", "B002ZG99H2", "B000P0J0C4", "B00002SSKI", "B00013RC7K", "0767824954", "B0002WT4OE", "B0001GF2D8", "B000M341QE", "B00BEIYN9Q", "6305899592", "B00008G8M5", "B002NZK5RI", "B00013WWT8", "B00003CWN3", "B00005RHGK", "B005CFBYW6", "B00AMEZDJW", "B001D2WU9I", "B002AT8KAG", "B0001LJCKC", "B0000524E5", "B004SIP9X8", "B00JOWHTB8", "B00005UQ6G", "B000069HZP", "B00AEFXUXU", "006095003X", "B0000JBUI2", "B00005JNCN", "0790732149", "B00003CXMP", "B0006FO8E8", "B001JV5BIA", "B00DHD933W", "B000FUTVVO", "B004499LX0", "B0001I562S", "B00AEFXO8Q", "B001OST0LW", "B0021L8UPS", "B0045O2PHS", "B002AT8K9W", "B0058ZPNBI", "B000BKJ762", "B00005JNY3", "B000A2UBN4", "B002DKGWSE", "B00366BBNU", "B00013RC2K", "B00004Z4WR", "B004SUDQ1I", "B00007E2F5", "B002XUBDRY", "B004O8OLO0", "6305313687", "B000CEV3M8", "B0052SO0H4", "B009XTF8KQ"], "bought_together": ["0767818024", "B00AEFY0XE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00001PE4D", "B00AEBB86A", "B00BB67UNW", "6305213305"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 7156}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.25, "brand": "UNI DIST CORP.

{"description": "This is the film that cemented Schwarzenegger's spot in the action-brawn firmament, and it was well deserved. He's chilling as the futuristic cyborg who kills without fear, without love, without mercy. James Cameron's story and direction are pared to the bone and all the more creepy. But don't overlook the contributions of Linda Hamilton, who more than holds her own as the Terminator's would-be victim, Sarah Connor--thus creating, along with Sigourney Weaver inAlien, a new generation of rugged, clear-thinking female action stars.

{"description": "The only real problem withStir of Echoeshas nothing to do with the movie itself, but with unlucky coincidence. Adapted from a Richard Mathesonnovel, this film  arrived around the same time asThe Sixth Sense, and surface similarities made it suffer by cursory comparison and the competing film's phenomenal success. It's a pity, because this one features one of Kevin Bacon's best performances, in a psychological thriller that makes a lot more right moves than wrong ones. Bacon plays a blue-collar guy who laments his ordinary life, only to learn, when his sister-in-law (Ileanna Douglas) hypnotizes him, that he is a \"receiver\" capable of seeing spirits and split-second glimpses of past and future events. It's a torturous gift to have--especially since his friendly Chicago neighborhood possesses a dark secret--and Bacon plays the role with an appropriate mixture of obsession and internalized torment.Similarity toThe Sixth Senseapplies only to the basic premise and the character of Bacon's young son. Otherwise, this is more of a hard-edged journey of self-discovery, marital crisis, and recovery, with Bacon's wife (played by the highly underrated Kathryn Erbe) involved in an underdeveloped subplot about a group of people who share Bacon's gift as paranormal \"receivers.\" Furthering his career as a writer-director of intelligent thrillers, David Koepp makes a few missteps in pacing and thematic overkill, but overallStir of Echoesis a sharp, sensitive thriller that unfolds to reveal a dramatically satisfying solution to its mystery.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEBBA2W", "B00004BZIY", "B00006AUJR", "B000VKKV3K", "B004SIP92O", "0800177789", "B00005JNY3", "6305718954", "B00007AJE1", "B000TJ6PBK", "B0001FR3IQ", "B00003CXKA", "B00AEFYYH6", "B002O3Z4Y8", "B0000648X0", "B002NZK5RI", "B00005JL3T", "0783222149", "B000V4UFZK", "B003VA3JUO", "B00003CWRF", "B000HT38IK", "B00009WVSL", "B0097C046W", "B00005JH9M", "B00008DDGY", "0783116926", "B004LWZW24", "B004AC6PV2", "B00008EY9G", "B0009X763M", "0783226837", "B0021L8UFI", "0783240295", "B00BEIYMAG", "B00011CZRE", "B00005UQ9W", "B004EPYZO4", "B002DKGWSE", "B0021L8UXA", "B0024FADD8", "B003ASLJQS", "6305161933", "155890848X", "B0001GF2D8", "B00064LJVE", "B009XTF8KQ", "B000Y7U97I", "B002GHHHN8", "B00EZ50SGW", "B00005JKZH", "B002JT69IW", "0767817737", "B00AEFYF2K", "6304711891", "B00KU2ZKKI", "0792840127", "B005LAIGOQ", "B001KKU9CI", "B001JNNDJM", "B00AZTUUQK", "B000U7169M", "B00026ZD04", "B002VWNIDG", "B002O3Z4WK", "B00AJLHUA8", "B003L20IEW", "B0002IQLHQ", "B000AM4P9K", "B00AEFY4CG", "B00IJS2OR2", "B00009PY4G", "B000OVLBGM", "B001BP4K22", "B001R3YRG2", "B0002234LS", "B0000694XX", "B00B96TGQS", "B002AT8K9W", "B000NIVJF4", "B000HC2LFI", "6305065551", "B00AIBZKV0", "B00013RC7K", "B004SUDQDG", "0792159659", "B000GFLKF8", "B0021L8UPS", "B00AEBB91E", "B000PMLJMQ", "B0001IMCFC", "B002NZK5SM", "6305428115", "B000LP6KNU", "B00006FDCD", "6304806434", "B00AEFXKZ8", "B008Y1YK7G", "B0006SGYL0"], "bought_together": ["B00AEBBA2W", "B00004BZIY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004SIP92O", "B004AC6PWG", "B00AEBBA2W", "B00004BZIY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 163731}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.99, "brand": "Lions Gate", "asin": "0784013470", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71YSZMKZKXL._SY300_.gif", "title": "Stir of Echoes"}

{"description": "This artfully constructed five-part series offers chilling evidence that  American democracy has become a convenient lie; that a conspiratorial coup  d'&eacute;tat removed a sitting president and then hid that fact from the  American people. This sounds like the stuff of wild-eyed paranoia, but these  filmmakers did their homework well--interviews include levelheaded witnesses,  suspicious government agents, and Dallas cops present in Dealey Plaza on  November 22, 1963. Some of the \"proof\" (especially in Episode&nbsp;2, \"The  Forces of Darkness\") seems a bit far-fetched, but the sheer number of  unexplained facts is riveting. An autopsy attendant describes a procedure  botched by meddling Secret Service agents. A deaf-mute eyewitness shares his  recollection of uniformed men hiding a rifle and leaving the site of the  assassination unchallenged. Eisenhower's security chief, present at the  shooting, discusses fatal safety lapses--as well as mysterious shots coming from  the opposite direction of the Texas School Book Depository. District Attorney  Jim Garrison points out that Lee Harvey Oswald, a Marine assigned to Russian  reconnaissance, operated a \"Communist\" organization out of a government  intelligence office. Senator Ralph Yarbrough, present in the motorcade, tells of  Kennedy's order to recall the troops from Vietnam--an order rescinded by the  Pentagon three days after his death. But the most powerful elements of this  documentary are the most personal, as hardened cops confess to lasting  nightmares, as senatorial investigators tearfully recall the moment they  realized the official story did not match the facts, and as simple bystanders  share their lasting grief at having witnessed the gory death of America's  innocence.--Grant Balfour", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 709018}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "title": "The Men Who Killed Kennedy [VHS]", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0032LV4MM", "B00AMHFPK6", "B002PTVMWO", "193806710X", "B002PTVMX8", "B00005JMA5", "B004FQX59I", "0615300995"], "also_viewed": ["B000BT96PK", "B000KAD9SU", "1626363137"]}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41VVEB24WGL._SY300_.jpg", "asin": "0788600931"}

{"description": "Do you know anyone who hasn't seen this movie? A box-office smash when released in 1993, this spectacular update of the popular 1960s TV series stars Harrison Ford as a surgeon wrongly accused of the murder of his wife. He escapes from a prison transport bus (in one of the most spectacular stunt-action sequences ever filmed) and embarks on a frantic quest for the true killer's identity, while a tenacious U.S. marshal (Tommy Lee Jones, in an Oscar-winning role) remains hot on his trail. Director Andrew Davis hit the big time with this expert display of polished style and escalating suspense, but it's the antagonistic chemistry between Jones and Ford that keeps this thriller cooking to the very end. In roles that seem custom-fit to their screen personas, the two stars maintain a sharply human focus to the grand-scale manhunt, and the intelligent screenplay never resorts to convenient escapes or narrative shortcuts. Equally effective as a thriller and a character study, this is a Hollywood blockbuster that truly deserves its ongoing popularity.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0790736411", "0767803434", "B00AEBB9UK", "B00008K76W", "B002NZK5R8", "B00AEFXT1S", "B000055Y0Y", "B00008K76V", "B004IK30MI", "B002NZK5UU", "B000CEV3M8", "B0045HCJ8K", "B00AEFXYJA", "B00008K76U", "0783225733", "B0045HCJFS", "B000O77SRC", "B000F8DV1M", "B00AEBB9NM", "B00AEFYXJ0", "B000EGDB10", "0800141601", "B002AT8K9W", "6305428115", "B0006GANOQ", "B00026ZG10", "6304711891", "B003ASLJIQ", "6304806434", "B000P0J0EW", "B00AEFY4CG", "B00AEFYF2K", "B000NTMA0Q", "0783240295", "B002NZK5VO", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00015YVDG", "B00AEBB8YW", "0790732238", "B002GIBVVG", "B00004STDN", "B002AT8KAG", "B00AEFXBG6", "B00AEFXVOI", "B000SFOW8I", "B002VWNICC", "B000U1ZV8K", "B002GHHHP6", "B00009WVSL", "B00008G8M4", "B002AS464Q", "B000PHVZNE", "B003AWRMBA", "0790732149", "B0007IO6NM", "B001ECDVJU", "B00AEBBA2W", "0783226888", "B000QUCRB4", "6305213283", "6304765258", "6304765266", "6305133468", "B00005B6JZ", "B002O3Z50G", "B00000G3PA", "B0043X1FNQ", "B000FO0AA6", "B00003CXGV", "B004AOECXI", "B00096S49Y", "B0014C2FX8", "6305236569", "B003ASLJMW", "B0014Z4OMU", "B000P0J0EM", "0790730979", "B0006N2EZ0", "0783222149", "B001LXIDW2", "0783226942", "B00001ZWUS", "B00AEFY5B6", "B00AEFXX9Q", "B00158K0QU", "B003QO8TOQ", "B00AEFXEGS", "0780618548", "0783235070", "B00004XPPG", "B0045HCJGC", "B000FO0A9W", "B0000AOV4I", "B000YCPUWW", "B00177YA1K", "630471193X", "B007SPPANM", "0792844874", "B00081U7HC"], "bought_together": ["0790736411", "0767803434"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000JYW5BE", "B004LWZW4M", "B000UBMSB8", "B0054OGQM8"]}, "price": 17.75, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 201394}, "asin": "079072961X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514VJP0EEHL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Fugitive"}

The heroes are an unlikely pair of young athletes who ran for Great Britain in the 1924 Paris Olympics: devout Protestant Eric Liddell (Ian Charleson), a divinity student whose running makes him feel closer to God, and Jewish Harold Abrahams (Ben Cross), a highly competitive Cambridge student who has to surmount the institutional hurdles of class prejudice and anti-Semitism. There's delicious support from Ian Holm (as Abrahams's coach) and John Gielgud and Lindsay Anderson as a couple of Cambridge fogies.

{"description": "A strong candidate for the designation of most thrilling action movie ever made (the turbo-charged exhilaration of its full-throttle highway chases has never been equaled), the second part of George Miller's post-apocalyptic trilogy is also a magnificently imagined movie myth. Like theStar Warstrilogy (by that other George) theMad Maxfilms draw their inspiration from the works of mythologist Joseph Campbell. In the 1979 original, Max (Mel Gibson) is a policeman, the last guardian of civilization and order in a devastated world reduced to chaos. But when a leather-clad gang of sadomasochistic speed demons mows down Max's family, his remaining connections to humanity are also permanently severed. After brutally exacting his revenge, Max wanders off into the wasteland alone, &quot;a burned out shell of a man&quot; who (to paraphraseThe Searchers) is destined to wander forever between the winds. InThe Road Warrior, Max rediscovers a sliver of his shattered humanity, and a spark of redemption, when he helps an embattled colony of pioneers fight off the savages who are after that most precious of all commodities: &quot;guzzline.&quot; Max is transformed into a legendary hero, just as Mel Gibson was catapulted to international movie stardom. With its final stirring images,The Road Warriortranscends its genre (whatever that may be--science fiction? Western? action adventure?) and becomes something timeless. It's a great movie.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005R2IS", "0790731932", "B00004Y87O", "B00AEFYDM2", "B003XURDAY", "B00005N5S5", "B00005N7Z1", "0783241895", "B001VLBDD0", "B0002CHK1S", "B000QUCQX8", "B000U1ZV8K", "B003ELKNH2", "B0038SUBEG", "B00000ILDD", "B000RW3VCK", "B0068FZ0O2", "B00AKGG828", "B00AEBBADG", "B00003CXC5", "B00I9TDMRM", "B008CYDD7I", "B00D7AM6M0", "B0000AOX0F", "0783227434", "B00005JMEW", "B003ASLJS6", "0783227396", "B002GHHHME", "0767802519", "1558908846", "B000E6ESEO", "0783228457", "6305821216", "B005J9ZFQG", "B0019BI1DM", "B00IBKXSKA", "B0087DFIYA", "B0000VD12I", "B001JFZ118", "B00005JMUA", "B00005JA8B", "B00005A3KS", "B000P0J0D8", "0790729695", "B004SIP8ZM", "B004SIP95G", "B0009UC810", "B0007WQHI0", "B0001Z37HM", "B0006GANN2", "B0045HCJIK", "B00005JLWN", "0767836316", "B0001611DI", "B000A2UBN4", "B000U1ZV7Q", "B000NA1WGS", "0792833244", "B000FS9FE4", "B002I9Z8AS", "B000QQJ3Q0", "B00005JLJW", "B000VECAD0", "6304806434", "B000056PMU", "B0045HCJGC", "B000P0J0BU", "B0045HCJ9O", "B00005ATQB", "B000022TSY", "B001CDR1FG", "B0045HCJT4", "B000CNESNA", "B00000JDIQ", "B00AEFXKUI", "B00026ZG10", "B000NOKFHQ", "B008Y1YK9Y", "6304698798", "B00004XPPG", "6305428115", "0783225946", "0800195175", "B000A7DVR2", "B003AWRMCE", "B0064NTZQ2", "B00070FX5U", "0792839056", "B000068IEV", "B00005AUK9", "B000WC3864", "B0002CHIKG", "B002AF4Y9G", "B00HZMZ2FE", "B00007AJG4", "B00003CXQA", "B0000A2ZU1", "B00BTYJYR6"], "bought_together": ["B00005R2IS", "0790731932"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00BLRXDTQ", "B00005R2IS", "B000NA1WGS", "0790731932"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 19723}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 29.74, "brand": "Road Warrior", "asin": "0790729342", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ndgIMhPTL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Road Warrior"}
{"description": "When Ridley Scott's cut ofBlade Runnerwas finally released in 1993, one had to wonder why the studio hadn't done it right the first time--11 years earlier. This version is so much better, mostly because of what's been eliminated (the ludicrous and redundant voice-over narration and the phony happy ending) rather than what's been added (a bit more character development and a brief unicorn dream). Star Harrison Ford originally recorded the narration under duress at the insistence of Warner Bros. executives who thought the story needed further \"explanation\"; he later confessed that he thought if he did it badly they wouldn't use it. (Moral: Never overestimate the taste of movie executives.) The movie's spectacular futuristic vision of Los Angeles--a perpetually dark and rainy metropolis that's the nightmare antithesis of \"Sunny Southern California\"--is still its most seductive feature, an otherworldly atmosphere in which you can immerse yourself. The movie's shadowy visual style, along with its classic private-detective/murder-mystery plot line (with Ford on the trail of a murderous android, or \"replicant\"), makesBlade Runnerone of the few science fiction pictures to legitimately claim a place in the film noir tradition.

{"description": "Paul Newman gives one of the defining performances of his career, and cemented his place as a beautiful-rebel screen icon playing the stubbornly tough and independent title character inCool Hand Luke. And before he became familiar as a sidekick in 1970s disaster movies (Earthquakeand theAirportmovies), George Kennedy won an Oscar for playing Dragline, the brutal chain-gang boss who tries to beat loner Luke's cool out of him.

{"description": "Twisterwas a mega-million-dollar blockbuster--helmed by a director (Dutchman Jan de Bont) hot off another scorcher hit (Speed)--that flaunted state-of-the-art digital effects and featured a popular leading actress (Helen Hunt) who would win an Academy Award for her next film (As Good As It Gets). But ask anybody who's seen it and they'll tell you who the real star ofTwisteris: the cow. Not to give anything away, but the cow is one of those inspired little touches (like, say, Bronson Pinchot's career-making cameo inBeverly Hills Cop) that adds a touch of personality to a gigantic Hollywood production. The story is blown out the window after an impressive prologue in which Hunt's character, as a little girl, witnesses her daddy being sucked into a tornado. Basically, Hunt and Bill Paxton are thrill-seeking meteorologists chasing twisters in order to study them (and help warn people of them, of course) with a new technology they've developed. If you thought the Kansas tornado inThe Wizard of Ozwas every bit as scary as the Wicked Witch of the West, then this may be the movie for you.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783225547", "B00E8G5HQE", "B00008G8M4", "B0002V7OI8", "B00000G3PA", "B00005JMXX", "B000P0J0C4", "B0006GANOQ", "B002GIBVVG", "B00AEFXPSK", "6304806434", "B001OFM2TC", "B0045HCJFS", "B0057RCFQS", "0783225733", "B00AEFXT1S", "B000N4RAS8", "B000P0J09W", "6304711891", "B00004Z4WR", "B007STBUHI", "B007SPPANM", "B00E8G5HZ0", "B001OQCV2E", "B0013BM63O", "B00AEFXPMG", "B000QUCRB4", "6305236569", "B000EHSVPK", "B002GHHHKQ", "B000EGDB10", "B00026ZG10", "B000QUU4LY", "B00AEFY4CG", "0800195175", "B001LXIDW2", "0790732149", "1558908315", "B00177YA1K", "B0007PLLBU", "B00003CXFV", "B00081U7HC", "6305212112", "1603800875", "B000JYW5BE", "B0068FZ0O2", "0783235070", "B00003CXTG", "B000FO0AA6", "B000ETRA5U", "B00005JN5E", "B001LXIDVS", "B006VRRGNK", "B0068FZ0GK", "B0013FDM7E", "B00003CXSM", "B00004XPPG", "B000CEV3M8", "6304765266", "B001LXIDVI", "B000QUCQX8", "B000QQLVPQ", "B00393SG1U", "0790730979", "B00AEFXE9U", "B00AEFXXMI", "B000EHSVNW", "0767803434", "B004AOECXI", "B000GRUMPU", "B001ECDVK4", "630471193X", "B00008WFU4", "B005QW98NM", "B000P0J0EW", "B00AEBB8NS", "B000SFOW8I", "B00AEFYW64", "B002NZK5V4", "B00AEFY6PQ", "B00008G6E8", "B0045HCJT4", "0783223609", "B00000IQC4", "B00005ATZT", "B00008WFU5", "B00008K76U", "B00AEFY5TI", "B0006FYOTC", "B007IUEE0C", "B00AEFY0F2", "B0002CHK1S", "0783225504", "B001CRC4DG", "B00407PO3W", "B002XUBDRY", "B0000844I8", "0800177258", "B00005JNTI"], "bought_together": ["B00008G8M4", "B00000G3PA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00634MLO0", "B00008G8M4", "B005LAIIPS", "0783225733"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 91188}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 13.95, "brand": "", "asin": "0790729636", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GW5RZP9SL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Twister"}
{"description": "Winner of four Academy Awards, including best picture, director, supporting actor, and best editing, Clint Eastwood's 1992 masterpiece stands as one of the greatest and most thematically compelling Westerns ever made. &quot;The movie summarized everything I feel about the Western,&quot; said Eastwood at the time of the film's release. &quot;The moral is the concern with gunplay.&quot; To illustrate that theme, Eastwood stars as a retired, once-ruthless killer-turned-gentle-widower and hog farmer. He accepts one last bounty-hunter mission--to find the men who brutalized a prostitute--to help support his two motherless children. Joined by his former partner (Morgan Freeman) and a cocky greenhorn (Jaimz Woolvett), he takes on a corrupt sheriff (Oscar winner Gene Hackman) in a showdown that makes the viewer feel the full impact of violence and its corruption of the soul.

Kennedy in November 1963. That fateful day in Dallas set in motion a sequence of events that would only intensify the mystery behind Kennedy's death, causing New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner) to begin an investigation that would gradually become a personal obsession. Bravura filmmaking combined with controversial treatment of historical facts and audacious speculation, this breathtaking revision of history presents a mesmerizing parade of shady figures and conspiracy theories, unfolding like a classic mystery based on history's greatest unsolved crime. A technical triumph boasting Oscar-winning cinematography and editing, Stone's film is guaranteed to grab the viewer's attention with its daring take on the JFK controversy.

{"description": "Some critics complained thatCity of Angelscould never compare to Wim Wenders's exquisite German filmWings of Desire, which served as the later film's primary inspiration. The better argument to make is that any such comparisons are beside the point, becauseWings of Desirewas a much more deeply poetic, artfully contemplative film, whereasCity of Angelsis an enchanting product of mainstream Hollywood. Meg Ryan stars as Dr. Maggie Rice, a heart surgeon who is grieving over a lost patient when an angel named Seth (Nicolas Cage) appears to comfort her. She can see him despite the \"rule\" that angels are invisible, and Seth's love for Maggie forces him to choose between angelic immortality and a normal human existence on earth with her. Featuring heavenly roles for TV veterans Andre Braugher and Dennis Franz, the film liberally borrows imagery fromWings of Desire, but it also creates its own charming identity. Cage and Ryan give fine performances as lovers convinced they are soul mates, and although the plot relies on a last-minute twist that doesn't quite work, this earnest love story struck a chord with audiences and proved to be one of the surprise hits of 1998.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000062VP", "B002GIBVWA", "B00007GZR5", "B005F2JRUC", "0783233477", "B004SIP9RO", "B0000AOV4I", "6305692572", "B00AEFY4CG", "B000YDBPAM", "630471193X", "B004SIP8JI", "B000XJD33O", "B002IVDLGY", "B00008G7UF", "B002XTXGCK", "B00081U7HC", "0767810856", "B002GHHHNI", "B000HEWEE4", "B0000DIXDR", "B00AEBB8JM", "B003ASLJK4", "B00AEFYC96", "B000YAA68C", "B004SIP8LG", "B001HN69C2", "B002GOAGZC", "6304765266", "B0013D8LH2", "B0000A2ZO0", "B00AEBB8NS", "B000683VI4", "B002NZK5TQ", "B0017ANB08", "B00004Z4WR", "B0021L8V3Y", "B00AKGG6JS", "B000EHRVOW", "B00AEFY0F2", "6304711891", "6304806434", "B00006RCNY", "B00000IQW5", "B00000G3PA", "B00005NRO0", "0767811100", "B0009OL7Z4", "B000XT1P34", "B002K0WBXW", "B00AEBB9WI", "B00004W46I", "B005LAIGSM", "B00005JKZH", "6305428034", "B00AEFXT1S", "076784744X", "B004SIP9VA", "B000023VTP", "6305212112", "B0017ANAZO", "B00C6F61HS", "B00003CXL7", "B00004BZIY", "0783230079", "B0041KKYHE", "B002O3Z4WK", "B000P0J0DS", "B0045HCJJ4", "B000BBOUW2", "0800141849", "B000053VB5", "B003AWRMBA", "B000TGJ8CQ", "B00005BCKF", "B00012QLB4", "0792838068", "B0001Z3TXE", "B00005JA9F", "B00005JKIS", "B00006ZXSQ", "6305718954", "B00AEFXKUI", "B001LPWGGY", "B00000JGHK", "B0002WZTOI", "B000059TG6", "B002NZK5VO", "B000BYA5G4", "B00004TJKK", "B00866JL96", "B000ARTN3I", "B003L20IHE", "B00006ZXSN", "B00009WVSL", "B002NZK5V4", "6305236569", "B0006GANOQ", "B00004WG2F"], "bought_together": ["B00007GZR5"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000NA1WDQ", "B005F2JRUC", "0783233477", "B00007GZR5"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 81839}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.99, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "0790737345", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510332ZGT1L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "City of Angels"}

Morpheus awakens Neo to the real world, a ravaged wasteland where most of humanity have been captured by a race of machines that live off of the humans' body heat and electrochemical energy and who imprison their minds within an artificial reality known as the Matrix.

{"description": "When the theatrical release of James Cameron'sTitanicwas delayed from July to December of 1997, media pundits speculated that Cameron's $200&nbsp;million disaster epic would cause the director's downfall, signal the end of the blockbuster era, and sink Paramount Studios as quickly as the ill-fated luxury liner had sunk on that fateful night of April&nbsp;14, 1912. Some studio executives were confident, others horrified, but the clarity of hindsight turned Cameron into an Oscar-winning genius, a shrewd businessman, and one of the most successful directors in the history of motion pictures.Titanicwould surpass the $1&nbsp;billion mark in global box-office receipts (largely due to multiple viewings, the majority by teenage girls), win 11&nbsp;Academy Awards including best picture and director, produce the best-selling movie soundtrack of all time, and make a global superstar of Leonardo DiCaprio. A bona fide pop-cultural phenomenon, the film has all the ingredients of a blockbuster (romance, passion, luxury, grand scale, a snidely villain, and an epic, life-threatening crisis), but Cameron's alchemy of these ingredients proved more popular than anyone could have predicted. His stroke of genius was to combine absolute authenticity with a pair of fictional lovers whose tragic fate would draw viewers into the heart-wrenching reality of theTitanicdisaster. As starving artist Jack Dawson and soon-to-be-married socialite Rose DeWitt Bukater, DiCaprio and Kate Winslet won the hearts of viewers around the world, and their brief but never-forgotten love affair provides the humanity that Cameron needed to turnTitanicinto an emotional experience. Present-day framing scenes (featuring Gloria Stuart as the 101-year-old Rose) add additional resonance to the story, and although some viewers proved vehemently immune to Cameron's manipulations, few can deny the production's impressive achievements. Although some of the computer-generated visual effects look artificial, others--such as the sunset silhouette ofTitanicduring its first evening at sea, or the climactic splitting of the ship's sinking hull--are state-of-the-art marvels. In terms of sets and costumes alone, the film is never less than astounding. More than anything else, however, the film's overwhelming popularity speaks for itself.Titanicis an event film and a monument to Cameron's risk-taking audacity, blending the tragic irony of theTitanicdisaster with just enough narrative invention to give the historical event its fullest and most timeless dramatic impact.Titanicis an epic love story on par withGone with the Wind, and like that earlier box-office phenomenon, it's a film for the ages.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305123616", "6304117752", "6301792734", "6303215734", "B00000JS61", "6304178352", "6303396623", "6303314015", "B00003CXTF", "0769403468", "6301734734", "6302936381", "6303300480", "6305368139", "B00005RRG3", "6302610702", "0792839846", "6300207919", "B000P0J0C4", "6304546262", "B000056BRF", "6304400551", "6303101267", "630150528X", "6303637574", "B000P0J0EW", "6305126062", "6302935148", "0800199421", "6304681496", "0792116887", "6301963911", "B0000DCGT1", "B00001IVED", "6305169187", "B00006RCST", "6300216721", "630197879X", "0800113055", "076780922X", "080010367X", "0800141326", "0800184319", "6304039522", "B000066AXC"], "bought_together": ["6305123616"], "also_viewed": ["B009VQHDSQ", "6303314015", "B0074JODXU", "B00003CXTF", "B003JQZXWW", "6302787068", "6301796535", "0788812807", "0788806270", "B00005JKDQ", "6304500831", "6305229449", "6304117752", "6300213668", "6304089767", "B0000AQZYM", "079213690X", "6303049079", "6305123616", "6303402348", "6301792734", "0788812408", "B00079HZSE", "B000035Z2S", "B00000K3AN", "0788805843", "6302526574", "B0000029YC", "6303534422", "6303215734", "B0070285YE", "B00008LDO9", "0783216084", "6304434340", "B00BBND56G", "0788805533", "6300183211", "6302320402", "6305750750", "B0002CHI3S", "0790748266", "6304143184", "B0000040CM", "B005X7H9SQ", "B00004RFHF", "B00005V1Z7", "6302814782", "6301572688", "B00000JS61", "B008SLUWZG", "6303257844", "B00078XGO2", "0790736039", "B0000040EJ", "B000065U6Q", "B00003CX7L", "B00000ADKZ", "6300263673", "6302178924"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 65950}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.47, "brand": "Paramount", "asin": "0792151712", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21BAWEVBJ1L.jpg", "title": "Titanic [VHS]"}
{"description": "Richard Gere works in a Chicago steel mill at the turn of the century, but must flee the city after accidentally killing a man. Heading for the wheat fields of Texas, he packs up his girlfriend (Brooke Adams) and his younger sister (Linda Manz). Instead of a better life, they head straight into tragedy when a wealthy farmer (Sam Shepard) falls for Adams. Believing him to be dying and expecting to inherit a fortune, she agrees to marry him. Their plans change when Shepard fails to die and Gere takes matters into his own hands. Aesthetically flawless, this film about a romantic love triangle is diminished by the small scope of video. Originally shown in 70mm, it is an eye-catching period piece that won its cinematographer, N&eacute;stor Almendros, a 1978 Oscar. Texture and color are the unbilled characters in this tragic tale, and are just as important as the players. The story, sadly, fades somewhat when compared to the glory of the visuals.--Rochelle O'Gorman", "related": {"also_bought": ["B005KQVE1S", "B00005PJ8T", "B005LLX582", "B001BNFRB2", "B000UJ48SQ", "B003ZYU3U0", "B00005QAPH", "B003O7I6SE", "B005HV6Y5W", "B008Y5OWSO", "B005152C9G", "B00005NC66", "0783225903", "0792841409", "B00180R072", "B001WLMOL4", "B00005UQ7T", "B0007GAG42", "B002IVDLGY", "B005152C7S", "B00K5EJHGO", "B00003CXUM", "B0050FXDDQ", "B00BC75HTE", "B003KGBISE", "B004NWPY20", "B00IBKXSKA", "B00AQ6J64O", "B00005AUKD", "B00HE011DE", "B000G8NXYG", "B00782O7LG", "B003IPJKX2", "6305972761", "B00393SG42", "B00005JLMU", "B00005AUK9", "B0087ZG7R0", "B000E33W0I", "B001MPS7GG", "B00065GX64", "B00003CXBU", "B00092ZLEY", "B0006UEVV8", "B0000WN0ZK", "B000AQKUG8", "B0057GYODG", "6305081034", "B000OPPADS", "B00AEFY9GW", "B000065V38", "B004WPYO7E", "0780023277", "B0000A02TX", "B001BEK8E2", "B00006RCNV"], "bought_together": ["B005KQVE1S", "B00005PJ8T"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005PJ8T", "B005LLX582", "B001BNFRB2", "B005KQVE1S"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 117532}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 22.74, "brand": "GERE,RICHARD", "asin": "079215455X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/517SAZS94HL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Days of Heaven"}
{"description": "The first, and only, X-rated film to win a best picture Academy Award, John Schlesinger'sMidnight Cowboyseems a lot less daring today (and has been reclassified as an R), but remains a fascinating time capsule of late-1960s sexual decadence in mainstream American cinema. In a career-making performance, Jon Voight plays Joe Buck, a naive Texas dishwasher who goes to the big city (New York) to make his fortune as a sexual hustler. Although enthusiastic about selling himself to rich ladies for stud services, he quickly finds it hard to make a living and eventually crashes in a seedy dump with a crippled petty thief named Ratzo Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman, doing one of his more effective &quot;stupid acting tricks,&quot; with a limp and a high-pitch rasp of a voice). Schlesinger's quick-cut, semi-psychedelic style has dated severely, as has his ruthlessly cynical approach to almost everybody but the lead characters. But at its heart the movie is a sad tale of friendship between a couple of losers lost in the big city, and with an ending no studio would approve today. It's a bit like an urbanOf Mice and Men, but where both guys are Lenny.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00079Z9VO", "0767830555", "B0006GANN2", "B000XJD34I", "B000022TSY", "B000RTB0R6", "B006TTC5HC", "B0010AN7Z4", "B0006GAOJA", "B004FQX5B6", "B00003CXBU", "6304907729", "B00005MEOU", "B00005M2CO", "B00AEFXN9G", "B0000549B1", "B0008ENHUI", "B0009S4IKQ", "B00005JKF6", "B003ELKNH2", "B000CNESTE", "B000ZM1MG4", "B00005AUKE", "B000BYA4HE", "B00006RCO2", "B00004XPPC", "B0006HBV3W", "B00011D1OK", "B00066FBQG", "B0002KPHZG", "B000BITV92", "B0010YVCI4", "B00AEFYSWM", "B000CEXEWA", "B000LPR6GA", "B0000YEEGM", "B00003CXB5", "B0001US8F8", "B000ZM1MGE", "0780021312", "B000CNESU8", "B0050FXDDQ", "B001EOQCMG", "B00006RCO1", "B00AATV07S", "B00782O7IY", "B00004TVUD", "B002VWNIBI", "0767827902", "076781326X", "B0049985XW", "0783240171", "B00012FXJ0", "B0087ZG7OI", "B0019L21GA", "B001GUYAZY", "6305918880", "B000EHSVS2", "B000KGGJ0Y", "B00000DQWS", "B00011D1OU", "B00002VWE0", "B00006RCO3", "B004SIP7F8", "B00AEFY6DI", "6304712936", "B003INBNOS", "B00AEBB95K", "B004L9GMBC", "079284646X", "B00AEBB9FA", "B003ZEQMH8", "B00AEBB89C", "B000LP6KNU", "B0019UGYK0", "B001D8W7EU", "B006FE83UE", "B000KJTGHO", "0792846109", "B0088XQBXQ", "B0087ZG7R0", "B007N31YH0", "B003O7I6SE", "B00AEFZDNA", "B000055Y0X", "B0019L770A", "B003LMPKSQ", "B000UJ48SQ", "B009NYF2GQ", "B000KX0IOA", "B004SIP9U6", "B00006ADD5", "B0045HCJTO", "0792838408", "B0045HCJ94", "B0045HCJ8U", "B000P0J09M", "B002VWNIAY", "B00008RH3J", "B005KQVE1S"], "bought_together": ["B00079Z9VO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004FQX5B6", "B006TTC5HC", "B0006GANN2", "B0000YEEGM"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 4113}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.99, "brand": "MGM", "asin": "0792833287", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51C3ME80X6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Midnight Cowboy"}
{"description": "What a combo! Tobe Hooper, the director ofThe Texas Chainsaw Massacre, teamed up with family-oriented producer Steven Spielberg to makePoltergeist. The film is about a haunted suburban tract home in a development very much like the Arizona one in which Spielberg was raised. (Because it came out the same summer as Spielberg'sE.T., it was tempting to see both movies as representing Spielberg's ambivalent feelings about childhood in suburbia. One was a fantasy, the other a nightmare.)  Spielberg also cowrote the screenplay, which taps into primal, childlike fears of monsters under the bed, monsters in the closet, sinister clown faces, and all manner of things that go bump in the night. At first, some of the odd happenings in the house are kind of funny and amusing, but they grow gradually creepier until the film climaxes in a terrifying special-effects extravaganza when 5-year-old Carole Anne (Heather O'Rourke) is kidnapped by the spooks and held hostage in another dimension. Though not nearly as frightening as Hooper's magnum opus, or the originalA Nightmare on Elm Street, which came along two years later,Poltergeistis one of the smartest and most entertaining horror pictures of its time.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00009PY4G", "B00006FDCD", "B00AEFYYH6", "B007STBUHI", "B004SIP92O", "B00004BZIY", "B000VECAD0", "B00000IQC4", "B00005A8XX", "B004LWZW24", "B001B1872U", "B009XTF8KQ", "B00386EZUY", "B000HCO86I", "B00005JOJE", "B0087F7VSY", "B001D2WU9I", "B000PMLJMQ", "B000067FP8", "B000E1P2EY", "B003PIUINI", "B0009X763M", "B000WC3864", "B003UN0752", "B002I41KNC", "B0021L8UFI", "B005GT3X68", "B000P0J0A6", "B0087ZG7PW", "B00AIBZLVY", "B0045HCJJE", "B000ASATZ8", "B0000VCZK2", "B00EZ50SGW", "B00005JNTI", "B000E33W1W", "B00008LUNW", "B00AEBBA2W", "B000CCBC9O", "B0006SGYL0", "B000FAOC2W", "B00008WFU4", "B000OA8OK4", "B00005JNNT", "B001AGXEAG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00004TDTO", "B00004BZIY", "B000VECAD0", "B00006FDCD"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 69740}, "asin": "0792833201", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31ZsC3YTJ5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Poltergeist"}
{"description": "The great improvisational comedy team of Mike Nichols and Elaine May reunited to (respectively) direct and write this update of the French comedyLa Cage Aux Folles. Robin Williams stars as a gay Miami nightclub owner who is forced to play it straight and ask his drag-queen partner (Nathan Lane) to hide out when Williams's son invites his prospective--and highly conservative--in-laws and fianc&eacute;e to a meet-and-greet dinner party. Gene Hackman and Dianne Wiest play the straight-laced senator and his wife, and Calista Flockhart (from television'sAlly McBeal) plays their daughter in a culture-clash with outrageous consequences. May's witty screenplay incorporates some pointed observations about the political landscape of the 1990s and takes a sensitive approach to the comedy's underlying drama. Topping off the action is Hank Azaria in a scene-stealing role as Williams's and Lane's flamboyant housekeeper, &quot;Agador Spartacus.&quot;--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000714BP", "B000QQLVPQ", "B00DW5IJR6", "0792843983", "B00EPH8SBM", "B0001HAGRE", "B00005BKZP", "B000ZM1MG4", "B004VJJGFG", "B007XTDWKQ", "B000EHRVOW", "B00081U7HC", "6305127670", "B000SFOW8I", "6305236569", "0783226772", "B0045HCJIK", "6305161879", "0783227396", "0800141849", "B00066FBQG", "078322740X", "6305609764", "B000B8QG22", "B0045HCJGW", "B000EGDB10", "B000056PMU", "B00003CWN3", "B00005JOFQ", "B000YDBPAM", "B0000AOV4I", "B00009W5CA", "B0000YEEGM", "B003Y5H5B0", "B00AEFXXMI", "B00005A06N", "B00386EZKE", "B00466HN7M", "B00GHP8SH4", "B000ELJAEM", "B001ECDVJU", "B002OOWKYE", "B00009WVSL", "B0001AVZA8", "B000K7VHLY", "B004EPYZUS", "B009NYF2GQ", "6305212112", "B0045HCJ80", "6305133468", "B008R65XMO", "B000LP6KNU", "B00AEFYRJQ", "B0000JBALO", "0784011710", "B00006FMUW", "B00008979E", "B00F98FOPE", "B0030ATZH6", "B0037XPPAM", "0800141806", "B00AEFXTKO", "B00AEFXT1S", "B000TXP56C", "B0041QSZS8", "B0002WZTOI", "B00004TJKK", "B00004RJ73", "B0038N9WKU", "B002JCSWV6", "B004A8ZWVK", "B00079Z9VO", "B00005ALS0", "B00AMSS3TA", "B004SEUJK0", "B0001ZX0O2", "630587493X", "0783227388", "B003ASLJQ8", "B000BT970O", "6305433909", "B0045HCJSA", "B002O3Z50G", "B0000CBY1C", "B002NZK5RS", "0790742071", "B00028HBIO", "B0007IO6NM", "0800177991", "B007N31YH0", "B0009DWL8W", "B00IA7MFEO", "B0000DIXDR", "6304711905", "B00COHGPD8", "B001P3SA94", "B0001Z4OXS", "B001VLBDD0", "B002NZK5V4", "B00JAQJMJ0"], "bought_together": ["B0000714BP", "B00EPH8SBM"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0000714BP", "B0015RRN84", "0792843983"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 2129}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.67, "brand": "Mgm/Ua Studios", "asin": "0792833198", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51AJN9TDTWL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Birdcage"}
{"description": "David Lynch peeks behind the picket fences of small-town America to reveal a corrupt shadow world of malevolence, sadism, and madness. From the opening shots Lynch turns the Technicolor picture postcard images of middle class homes and tree-lined lanes into a dreamy vision on the edge of nightmare. After his father collapses in a preternaturally eerie sequence, college boy Kyle MacLachlan returns home and stumbles across a severed human ear in a vacant lot. With the help of sweetly innocent high school girl (Laura Dern), he turns junior detective and uncovers a frightening yet darkly compelling world of voyeurism and sex. Drawn deeper into the brutal world of drug dealer and blackmailer Frank, played with raving mania by an obscenity-shouting Dennis Hopper in a career-reviving performance, he loses his innocence and his moral bearings when confronted with pure, unexplainable evil. Isabella Rossellini is terrifyingly desperate as Hopper's sexual slave who becomes MacLachlan's illicit lover, and Dean Stockwell purrs through his role as Hopper's oh-so-suave buddy. Lynch strips his surreally mundane sets to a ghostly austerity, which composer Angelo Badalamenti encourages with the smooth, spooky strains of a lush score.Blue Velvetis a disturbing film that delves into the darkest reaches of psycho-sexual brutality and simply isn't for everyone. But for a viewer who wants to see the cinematic world rocked off its foundations, David Lynch delivers a nightmarish masterpiece.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["6304510861", "6303018351", "0790705141", "6300182770", "6302185882", "6303515304", "6300147630", "6304346158", "6300214044", "6302226899", "B000067DGJ", "B00004T37H", "0792839846", "630026999X", "0792846303", "6303422969", "0783229585"], "also_viewed": ["6302185882", "6300182770"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 325598}, "asin": "0792838084", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71W22ZVC1XL._SY300_.gif", "title": "Blue Velvet [VHS]"}

{"description": "Thief's dark noir spaces are tinged with the neon palette that has become the trademark of director Michael Mann (Miami Vice,Heat).  This was his first theatrical film, and all the elements that characterize his later style (and this is averystylistic film) are dominant.  Equal parts grit and glamour, the story is simple.  Frank (James Caan) is a lone-wolf jewel thief who was, in his words, brought up \"by the state.\"  In prison he was apprenticed to a master thief, played by Willie Nelson.  When Frank's successful career comes to the attention of an avuncular syndicate boss (Robert Prosky), Frank is offered (and accepts against his better judgment) a deal that should allow him to retire and enjoy the family life he covets.  But the deal sours, and Frank is left to decide what his nature truly is, lone wolf or family man.Thiefmelds its jazzy visual style with heightened realism: the jewel thief's tools of the trade are authentic, up to the 8,000 degree thermal lance  used to cut through a nearly impregnable safe.  Some of the bit parts are played by real-life, highly successful jewel thieves, who acted as consultants.  And their presence informs the superb dialogue, as every word  rings true. In one long, engrossing scene, James Caan gradually persuades the woman he wants to start a family with (Tuesday Weld in one of her most affecting performances) that they should be together.  The film was photographed beautifully by Donald Thorin  and further emboldened by the driving rhythms of Tangerine Dream.  The DVD contains a very funny commentary track by the director and James Caan.--Jim Gay", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEFY3TA", "B0007ZEOC8", "B00005JLJW", "B0000074CG", "B00005QCVU", "B00GKP70L6", "B00HT2L7VS", "B0009GX1CE", "0792840453", "B00005A8TX", "B000UGBOT0", "0792838300", "B000P0J0AG", "B004DSCMLA", "B00005UQ9T", "B00097DY2A", "B0007VZ99E", "B005FQ2HBO", "B0008KLVA0", "B00I116MZ2", "B00006JMPS", "B004LB5F9U", "B00HT2RTU6", "B0008ENHTY", "B000AQKUG8", "B004YCKKFK", "B00E18QKJ2", "0767824555", "B000244EWO", "B003O7I6SE", "B00003CWRX", "B001TIQT6G", "B00005K3NV", "B00HOGBXS6", "B00005U2KC", "B000LC4ZBW", "B002AO004A", "B0001FGBW0", "B000EHSVR8", "B0000DI87S", "B00J5LXST0", "B000N3SROA", "B00AEFY9YY", "B0003JANSW", "B000286RP2", "B00005K3NU", "B00JAGF9E2", "B0000542CB", "B00008MTW1", "B000059TFP", "B001B1UO7G", "B0049M7BHA", "B000QXDFRG", "B000NTMA0G", "B00AEFXRG0", "B000HWZ4D4", "B00AEBB8LA", "B00AEFYTMQ", "B000063US3", "B00JX3SHIC", "B00005JN2Z", "B008FYZHHE", "B001CC7PM6", "B0000BUZKP", "B00GMV8M2Y", "B0006HBV3C", "B001GCATWK", "B00BN3EE14", "B000000I71", "B000063K2Q", "B00AEFXJF4", "B00G92TYCI", "B000PKG6OE", "0767818083", "B00005JLEJ", "B001C0I61M", "B0007MAO0C", "B00AEFXORM", "B00AEBB95K", "B0006TPDPM", "B00004REAG", "B000BR6QCI", "B004C2523M", "B00407PNY2", "B000002N4J", "0792833279", "B00005BKZI", "B007N5YJMA", "6304765258", "B000E5LEVA", "B000AQKUH2", "B000CNESTE", "B00GST8U4U", "6305999872", "B0008ENHUS", "B00006RCNV", "B00AEFXBG6", "B005152C9G", "B00AEBB9N2"], "bought_together": ["B00AEFY3TA", "B0007ZEOC8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["078322947X", "B00J2PQYYK", "B00F98FOFY", "B00F98FOI6"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 24977}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 10.79, "brand": "MGM", "asin": "0792838947", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51H17HXGBSL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Thief (Special Director's Edition)"}
{"description": "Based on Thomas Harris's novel, this terrifying film by Jonathan Demme really only contains a couple of genuinely shocking moments (one involving an autopsy, the other a prison break). The rest of the film is a splatter-free visual and psychological descent into the hell of madness, redeemed astonishingly by an unlikely connection between a monster and a haunted young woman. Anthony Hopkins is extraordinary as the cannibalistic psychiatrist Dr. Hannibal Lecter, virtually entombed in a subterranean prison for the criminally insane. At the behest of the FBI, agent-in-training Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) approaches Lecter, requesting his insights into the identity and methods of a serial killer named Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine). In exchange, Lecter demands the right to penetrate Starling's most painful memories, creating a bizarre but palpable intimacy that liberates them both under separate but equally horrific circumstances. Demme, a filmmaker with a uniquely populist vision (Melvin and Howard,Something Wild), also spent his early years making pulp for Roger Corman (Caged Heat), and he hasn't forgotten the significance of tone, atmosphere, and the unsettling nature of a crudely effective close-up. Much of the film, in fact, consists of actors staring straight into the camera (usually from Clarice's point of view), making every bridge between one set of eyes to another seem terribly dangerous.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005LKIM", "6302054982", "B00008AOS5", "B00005PJ8I", "B000007OY0", "6302800420", "0790705141", "B00003CXE6", "6301179552", "6301427076", "B000003KHS", "6300989003", "6303402348", "B0000633ZP", "B00005ATQA"], "bought_together": ["6302054982"], "also_viewed": ["6305363668", "6302415853", "0792116887", "079213690X", "0800103106", "6305750750"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 331980}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.0, "brand": "", "asin": "0792842111", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4117Q86BS0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Silence of the Lambs [VHS]"}

Discovering why is half the fun, so for now let's just say that Phibes is a little mad and very, very angry. With his assistant, the lovely, silent Vulnavia, Phibes begins cutting a gory swath through London's medical community, with the dogged Inspector Trout hot on his tail.Phibescontains many pleasures--exquisite art direction and a dark sense of humor among them--but the real treat is in watching an old pro like Price at work. Whether he's playing his organ, staring down a victim, or drinking through his neck, Price is at the top of his game. He mixes dark menace with wry comic touches, revealing both Phibes's maniacal obsession and offhanded confidence in his own genius.

{"description": "FutureNightmarecreator andScreamweaver Wes Craven's  film debut is a primitive little production that rises above its cut-rate  production values and hazy, grainy patina via its grimly affecting portrait  of human evil infiltrating a middle-class household. The story is adapted  from Ingmar Bergman'sThe Virgin Spring, but the film has more in  common with Sam Peckinpah'sStraw Dogsas it charts the descent of a  harmless married couple into methodical killers. A quartet of criminals--a  distorted version of the nuclear family--kidnaps a pair of teenage girls and  proceeds to ravage, rape, torture, and finally brutally murder them in the  woods, unwittingly within walking distance of their rural home. The killers  take refuge in the girls' own home, but when the parents discover just who  they are and what they've done, they plot violent retribution.Along with George Romero'sNight of the Living Deadand Tobe Hooper'sTexas Chainsaw Massacre, Craven helped redefine American horror with  this debut--all three movies portray modern society crumbling into madness  and horror. But, unlike his fellow directors, Craven gives his film an  uncomfortable verisimilitude, setting it squarely in the heartland of modern  America. While at times it's awkward and inconsistent, with distracting comic  interludes, his handling of the brutal horror scenes is unsettling, and the  death of the daughter is an unexpectedly quiet and lyrical moment.--Sean  Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792839242", "6302921058", "B00000K0DU", "6300214311", "6300182770", "B00000IQUT"], "also_viewed": ["6302921058"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 475308}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.78, "brand": "", "asin": "079284632X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/512ZWA7XGZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Last House on the Left [VHS]"}

{"description": "Just what the world needs, another riff on that post-Psychohorror clich&eacute;: the slasher movie. In this version, which considerably dumbs down the Lois Duncan book, the bad guy chases naughty teenagers with a hook, all the while dressed as a dark version of the Gorton's fisherman. They seem to have killed someone in a car accident while out partying, and a price must be paid. Nothing new is added to the genre, though it would be unfair not to note that this does have some scary moments. That is about all it has, because as much as this wanted to be anotherScream, it hasn't the heart or the script. It does, however, have the requisite cast of small-screen stars (includingParty of Five's Jennifer Love Hewitt and Buffy herself, Sarah Michelle Gellar) to have snagged box-office success, spawning a sequel.--Rochelle O'Gorman", "related": {"also_bought": ["0767826728", "0792151712"], "bought_together": ["0767826728"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 332658}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.8, "brand": "", "asin": "0800184319", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/7107W97AXAL._SY300_.gif", "title": "I Know What You Did Last Summer [VHS]"}

{"description": "Overview\nFormer vice president Al Gore shares his concerns on the pressing issue of global warming in this documentary. A long-time environmental activist, Gore first became aware of evidence on global warming in the 1970s, and since leaving public office he has become a passionate advocate for large- and small-scale changes in our laws and lifestyles that could help alleviate this crisis. An Inconvenient Truth records a multi-media presentation hosted by Gore in which he discusses the scientific facts behind global warming, explains how it has already begun to affect our environment, talks about the disastrous consequences if the world's governments and citizens do not act, and shares what each individual can do to help protect the Earth for this and future generations. An Inconvenient Truth was directed by Davis Guggenheim, a veteran documentary filmmaker who also has an extensive background in episodic television.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JPXA", "B0013D8LHM", "B0027BOL4G", "0670062723", "B004IN75D0", "B0042EJD8A", "B00018U8YE", "B000YKI4MM", "B00147F8WS", "B0012Q3T72", "B0002OXVBO", "B000UNYJXQ", "B003M987AG", "1594865671", "B000I5Y8FU", "B001C17EVE", "B00005JMXX", "B001MWGZ6S", "B002PLMJ74", "B00366E1AK", "B001EP8EOY", "B000BTH4K4", "B000RPCJSE", "B002RB56W2", "B001EUSYHQ", "B0019KAQB8", "B004SO26RE", "B000BI5KV0", "B005OCJJ9M", "B002RX8G5E", "B005YFGIZM", "B000PY52IG", "B0041KKYBA", "B00AZMFNX2", "B001KWB0L0", "B003FNQ0I0", "B0069UP2PI", "0812982894", "B003Q6D28W", "0674058178", "B000BJS4FS", "B003Q6D28C", "1405187360", "B005YFGIZ2", "B0019A35G6", "B000OUCEZU", "B005ZMBDJK", "1594867348", "B00FGVS0DM", "B000MQ4WX8", "B005TZFZK6", "0312428928", "B0053ZHZI2", "B0055V6EX6", "B008NNY98U", "0767805712", "B00APG8QQO", "1586481983", "B002KLALEC", "B00DPUB5LK", "B003GSLVX8", "B00AEFXPSK", "B001E0KSAM", "B008LW2520", "B0009GX1EM", "B000WLUXZE", "B003CAKXAC", "B000CPHAAG", "B00IWULQQ2", "1931930007", "B00EL6AAEU", "B00013F2S6", "B005LAIH4A", "B000B0WO4O", "B006ZAPSJW", "B000EOTEM2", "0521732557", "B0007DBJM8", "B0018PH3NI", "B00CMDPTA4", "B004JR3OKI", "B00744WZ8U", "B0025XUTKQ", "B001M0N8UQ", "B0040QYRS6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005JPXA", "B0027BOL4G", "0670062723", "B004SO26RE"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 50499}, "asin": "1415724784", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51p%2Btk39UpL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "An Inconvenient Truth"}

{"description": "Filmmaker Chris Payne explores the many factors that played into the ultimate failure of the electric car to catch on with consumers, even as gas prices began to skyrocket, in a thoughtful meditation on the increasingly important role that renewable energy plays in modern society. Introduced as a means of providing an alternative to increasing oil consumption and reducing pollution in 1996, the electric car was an all-but-forgotten memory only a decade later -- but why? Through interviews with consumer advocacy experts, automotive industry experts, and oil industry heavyweights, Payne paints a thought-provoking picture of a culture whose aversion to change and reliance on dwindling resources may be rooted in the financial concerns of a wealthy few, and may also be leading consumers down a troubling path.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B005TZFZK6", "B0042EJD8A", "B003M987AG", "B000ICL3KG", "B00005JPXA", "B003CAKXAC", "B0027BOL4G", "B0013D8LHM", "B000PY52IG", "B00FGVS0DM", "B0007DBJM8", "B001KWB0L0", "B001EUSYHQ", "B000FBH3W2", "B001MWGZ6S", "B004SO26RE", "B000UNYJXQ", "B00744WZ8U", "B000BTH4K4", "B005YFGIZ2", "B001EP8EOY", "B000PWQPAW", "B00018U8YE", "B00D8NTEP8", "B00366E1AK", "B0055V6EX6", "B005BO5OQ0", "B0019KAQB8", "B0041KKYBA", "B002PLMJ74", "B0012Q3T72", "B002RB56W2", "B004IN75D0", "B005YFGIZM", "B004L51CZM", "B00BI6A56E", "B00147F8WS", "067942105X", "B0006212H2", "B003Q6D28C", "B0002OXVBO", "B002RX8G5E", "B00G0PXU2Y", "B006KH6D08", "1557885680", "B00BOZQ54K", "B00CPTUOI2", "B000YKI4MM", "B00AZMFNX2", "B0077QPPGO", "0957149506", "B00AJLHU80", "630542828X", "B004CJQVQC", "B0002HDXTQ", "B000060MW1", "0071770569", "B004CJQVI0", "B008TYGCWY", "159932220X", "160529263X", "B006H37OQC", "B0096DP4CG", "B000U6YJMO", "B000X1ZPE2", "0071543732", "B001GCUO0W", "0809030640", "B000BI5KUQ", "B00004Y62V", "B000Y7U9A0", "B00914YLAG", "B002N7W3IA", "B000OU081M", "B001P9G3HE", "B00443YDWK", "B00APG8QQO", "B0062AHEM4", "B00483VQTE", "B00HUAP0NK", "0783233523", "0470496371", "B0053ZHZI2", "B005WL3QBW", "B00AEFXPSK", "B0001CNRAM", "B007XF0XH0", "0783225733", "B000055ZOB", "B00BCV3IN2", "B0002HOERG", "B004O63TX6", "B000MR9D5E"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005TZFZK6", "B0042EJD8A", "B004SO26RE", "B0027BOL4G"]}, "price": 8.83, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 424982}, "asin": "1424819547", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31ER%2B1h5B-L.jpg", "title": "Who Killed the Electric Car?

After Mitchum makes clear his plans to harm Peck's family, a fascinating game of crisscrossing ethics and morality takes place. Where the more recent version seemed trapped in its explicitness, Thompson's film accomplishes a lot with a more economical and telling use of violence.

Jatin's brother Ashok (who forced Jatin's marriage) is married to Radha. Deeply frustrated at her inability to conceive, he has joined a radical cult that forbids all sexual contact.

{"description": "Among the earliest writers to set his sights on the director's chair, Preston Sturges brought a frank, unsentimental view of the war between the sexes to his mid-'40s features that exemplify his style, as demonstrated in this prescient 1942 gem. Architect Tom Jeffers (Joel McCrea) and his wife, Gerry (Claudette Colbert), further refine the archetypal Sturges couple--the male embodying strength, idealism, and a certain naivete, the female ultimately stronger, smarter, and (as revealed early on in an astonishing speech by Colbert) clearer-eyed and more pragmatic about the subtext of sex. This giddy shaggy-dog story follows the couple's split, and Gerry's subsequent flight to Palm Beach. This head-snapping frolic is paced by double-entendres and lampooning looks at the very rich, with standout performances by the predatory Princess Centimillia (the delicious Mary Astor), who's more than ready to comfort Tom, and the wealthy, dim-witted John D. Hackensacker III (Rudy Vallee, staking out a new career, post-crooner, as comic foil), Gerry's new suitor. Even the predictable reunion of the star-crossed lovers is achieved with an antic surrealism. Sturges's strength in building strong character ensembles is matched by his affection for coupling screwball dialogue with physical slapstick, seldom to better effect than in the drunken target practice of the Ale and Quail Club, who make Colbert's train ride to Florida a different kind of shoot-'em-up.--Sam Sutherland", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783228074", "6300216233", "1558807780", "6301734734", "B00005LCAQ", "B00156HZM4", "B00000JKNL", "6304212135", "6300185125", "6300269795", "6303364772", "6302305950", "6301972171"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 426923}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6300185206", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51BJPV02E1L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Palm Beach Story [VHS]"}

{"description": "This splatter flick, along with John Carpenter'sHalloween, helped spawn the great horror-movie movement of the '80s, not to mentioneightsequels, many of which had nothing to do with the films that preceded them. It also gave birth to Jason Voorhees, one of the three biggest horror-movie psychos of the modern era (the other two beingHalloween's Michael Myers andA Nightmare on Elm Street's Freddy Krueger). Forever duplicated, the originalFriday the 13thpopularized a number of themes and techniques that today are now clich&eacute;s: the increasingly gory murders, the remote forest location, the anonymous and nubile cast, the murderer as cult hero, and, of course, the moral that if you have sex, you will die, very painfully. Still, if you have to see aFriday the 13thmovie, this is the one to check out. A group of eager (and horny) teenagers decide to reopen Camp Crystal Lake, which 20 years earlier was closed after the shocking and mysterious murders of two amorous camp counselors. You can take it from there, as the teens get picked off one by one, during a dark and stormy night; of course, their car won't start and there's no phone. The ending stole shamelessly from Brian De Palma'sCarrie, but it still provides a slight if campy shock. Look for a young Kevin Bacon as the requisite stud--you can tell that's what he is because when the cast appears in swimsuits, he's wearing a Speedo--who's the beneficiary of the film's best murder sequence, an arrowhead to the throat.

{"description": "Widely considered the best movie in the \"classicTrek\" series of feature films,Star Trek IVreturns to one of the favorite themes of the original TV series--time travel--to bring Kirk, Spock, McCoy, Scotty, Sulu, Uhura, and Chekov from the 23rd century to present-day San Francisco. In their own time, the Starfleet heroes encounter an alien probe emitting a mysterious message--a message delivered in the song of the now-extinct Earth species of humpback whales. Failure to respond to the probe will result in Earth's destruction, so Kirk and company time-travel to 20th-century Earth--in their captured Klingon starship--to transport a humpback whale to the future in an effort to peacefully communicate with the alien probe. The plot sounds somewhat absurd in description, but as executed by returning director Leonard Nimoy, this turned out to be a crowd-pleasing adventure, filled with humor and lively interaction among the favorite Star Trek characters. Catherine Hicks (from TV's7th Heaven) plays the 20th-century whale expert who is finally convinced of Kirk's and Spock's benevolent intentions. With ample comedy taken from the clash of future heroes with 20th-century urban realities,Star Trek IVwas a box-office smash, satisfying mainstream audiences and hardcoreTrekfans alike.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303202004", "6300213803", "6301543408", "6300216802", "6300214400", "6304415346", "B00008OSD3", "6303909949", "6305587159"], "bought_together": ["6303202004", "6300213803"], "also_viewed": ["6300214400", "6300213803", "6301543408", "6303202004", "6300216802", "6304415346", "0800103106", "B00004U8P4", "6300214540", "630273486X", "630339406X", "6302877881", "B00BAXTYIA", "B00000ILBK", "6304539274", "B00DB97LCM", "B001TH16DI"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 116860}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 0.98, "brand": "", "asin": "630021463X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51G68FMQNQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Star Trek IV - The Voyage Home [VHS]"}

Despite scientists' warnings about the star's destructive potential, government officials refuse to take action that could cause international panic, but a consortium of private industrialists prepare for the worst by building a gigantic spaceship--an ark for humanity to begin life anew on a distant planet. Who will be chosen to go, and who left behind? As earthquakes roar and massive tidal waves devastate entire cities, the huge rocket prepares for take-off from its miles-long launching ramp--ready to abandon the shattered Earth!

For a Disney film, however, it seems more the self-satisfied sum of its inventiveness than a truly engaging experience.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["6304401132", "155890641X", "0788812408", "0788802194", "0788812807", "6302526574", "078881172X", "6302642248", "0788806270", "6302178924", "6303314015", "6302320402", "6304500831", "6300274195", "6300275310", "6303983812", "6302961572", "6305229449", "B000035Z2S", "6304400551", "0788805843", "6305319138", "6304290888", "6302787068", "0788803743", "6304089767", "6303929338", "6304100507", "B00005JKDQ", "B0000AQZYM", "6302158095", "6305326940", "6304978286", "6300274608", "B00000ICHA", "6304400225", "6305940932", "B00004R99N", "6301390725", "6302426200", "B00003CXQX", "B00005T7H6", "6301991311", "B00003CXHR", "B00003CX7L", "6303122647", "0788805533", "0788812440", "B00005RDVV", "1558906150", "6304089201", "6303036813", "B00000JS61", "6303534422", "6304501153", "6304155972", "B00005JKX3", "B0000524CZ", "0788811002", "B00016JF2W", "B0000E32WB", "1558901892", "B00000J2JA", "6304400381", "B00005JL95", "6304873441", "0788810634", "B0009SUS4Q", "6302484359", "078880720X", "6300276554", "B0002YLCHE", "0788810448", "B00007AJLB", "B00004R996", "B000063V8N", "0788812181", "B00008Y47S", "6304492952", "B00000ICHI", "6303295614", "6304089627", "B00004R99I", "6304492960", "6303439357", "B000035Z46", "B0001I55VK", "6302313937", "6303939015", "B00029LO18", "B00004REYY", "B00003CXXI", "0788809806", "B00005K9OA", "B00008DP4A", "6305942285", "6301106539", "6304401736", "6305177473"], "bought_together": ["6304401132", "0788812408"], "also_viewed": ["0788802194", "0788812408", "6303314015", "6304401132", "6302642248", "6302526574", "6304500831", "0788806270", "155890641X", "6302787068", "6302320402", "6302178924", "6304400551", "078881172X", "6300274195", "B000035Z2S", "6303983812", "6304290888", "6300275310", "0788805843", "0788812807", "6305319138", "6303534422", "B0000AQZYM", "6302961572", "6305229449", "6303929338", "6304089767", "6305940932", "6304978286", "6304100507", "0788805533", "B00005JKDQ", "6302426200", "6305326940", "B00004R99N", "B00003CXHR", "6300274608", "6304400225", "B00005RDVV", "B00003CX7L", "6304089201", "B0007KTBIU", "6302158095", "6301991311", "B00005JL95", "B00003CXQX", "6304501153", "0788812440", "B00004R99I", "B00000ICHA", "6304400381", "1558906150", "0788811002", "6304117752", "6301390725", "B00003CXXI", "B00000JS61"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 113227}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.43, "brand": "Disney", "asin": "6300274268", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51yPdnVWYXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Alice in Wonderland (Walt Disney Masterpiece Collection) [VHS]"}

{"description": "Seven years after he earned his first screen credit as the writer ofFast Times at Ridgemont High, formerRolling Stonewriter Cameron Crowe made his directorial debut with this acclaimed romantic comedy starring John Cusack and Ione Skye as unlikely lovers on the cusp of adulthood. The casting is perfect, and Crowe's rookie direction is appropriately unobtrusive, no doubt influenced by his actor-loving, Oscar&reg;-winning mentor, James L. Brooks. But the real strength of Crowe's work is his exceptional writing, his timely grasp of contemporary rhythms and language (he's frequently called \"the voice of a generation\"), and the rich humor and depth of his fully developed characters. InSay Anything...Cusack and Skye play recent high school graduates enjoying one final summer before leaping into a lifetime of adult responsibilities. Lloyd (Cusack) is an aspiring kickboxer with no definite plans; Diane (Skye) is a valedictorian with intentions to further her education in Europe. Together they find unlikely bliss, but there's also turbulence when Diane's father (John Mahoney)--who only wants what's best for his daughter--is charged with fraud and tax evasion. Favoring strong performances over obtrusive visual style, Crowe focuses on his unique characters and the ambitions and fears that define them; the movie's a treasure trove of quiet, often humorous revelations of personality. Lili Taylor and Eric Stoltz score high marks for memorable supporting roles, and Cusack's own sister Joan is perfect in scenes with her onscreen and offscreen brother. A rare romantic comedy that's as funny as it is dramatically honest,Say Anything...marked the arrival of a gifted writer-director who followed up with the underratedSinglesbefore scoring his first box-office smash withJerry Maguire.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300147940", "630018403X", "B000051S41", "6300183467", "6300263673", "6300214370", "0792837207", "6300184269", "6300214753", "B000068MFS", "6300214710"], "bought_together": ["6300147940"], "also_viewed": ["0800109481", "6300213986", "6300214710", "B001AEF6BI", "6300183467", "0790740222", "0767825411", "6300270033"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 257141}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6301412761", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41V8JBQ2E7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Say Anything [VHS]"}

{"description": "Rebeccais an ageless, timeless adult movie about a woman who marries a widower but fears she lives in the shadow of her predecessor. This was Hitchcock's first American feature, and it garnered the Best Picture statue at the 1941 Academy Awards. In today's films, most twists and surprises are ridiculous or just gratuitous, so it's sobering to look back on this film where every revelation not only shocks, but makes organic sense with the story line. Laurence Olivier is dashing and weak, fierce and cowed. Joan Fontaine is strong yet submissive, defiant yet accommodating.

{"description": "The second--and most horrifying--of the fivePlanet of the Apesmovies, this film goes where few end-of-the-world movies ever dare tread. It's the far future. The mass of humanity has descended into speechless savagery, kept as captive animals by the talking apes who have inherited the world. Two astronauts from our time have landed here, retracing the path of their lost comrade, Captain Taylor (Charlton Heston). Unfortunately, they've landed in the middle of a grim situation. Warlike gorillas are preparing to eliminate the last shards of shattered human civilization, a degenerate, subterranean cult worshipping the greatest of all human achievements--the cobalt bomb.

{"description": "This 1963 extravaganza, directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz, is certainly an epic historical drama with all the elements: elaborate sets, intricate costuming, name actors, a factual basis, and an overlong script (just over four hours). But the acting is well performed and the backdrops are lush, making this a film worth seeing. Elizabeth Taylor is Cleopatra, the Egyptian queen who seduces Julius Caesar (Rex Harrison) in a political move to hold onto her empire. When Caesar is killed in the Roman Senate, Cleopatra looks to Marc Antony (Richard Burton) for his support, practically enslaving him with her wiles. Taylor is dramatic in her role, at times overly serious, but stunning nonetheless as the woman described as \"well versed in the natural sciences and mathematics. She speaks seven languages proficiently. Were she not a woman one would consider her to be an intellectual.\" While the film does seem to drag at moments, it deserves the four Oscars it won for cinematography, art direction-set direction, costumes, and special effects. Don't confuse thisCleopatrawith the 1934 version directed by Cecil B.

{"description": "Ranking No. 21 on the American Film Institute's list of the 100 greatest American films, this 1940 classic is a bit dated in its noble sentimentality, but it remains a luminous example of Hollywood classicism from the peerless director of mythic Americana, John Ford. Adapted by Nunnally Johnson from John Steinbeck's classic novel, the film tells a simple story about Oklahoma farmers leaving the depression-era dustbowl for the promised land of California, but it's the story's emotional resonance and theme of human perseverance that makes the movie so richly and timelessly rewarding. It's all about the humble Joad family's cross-country trek to escape the economic devastation of their ruined farmland, beginning when Tom Joad (Henry Fonda) returns from a four-year prison term to discover that his family home is empty. He's reunited with his family just as they're setting out for the westbound journey, and thus begins an odyssey of saddening losses and strengthening hopes. As Ma Joad, Oscar-winner Jane Darwell is the embodiment of one of America's greatest social tragedies and the \"Okie\" spirit of pressing forward against all odds (as she says, \"because we're the people\"). A documentary-styled production for which Ford and cinematographer Gregg Toland demanded painstaking authenticity,The Grapes of Wrathis much more than a classy, old-fashioned history lesson. With dialogue and scenes that rank among the most moving and memorable ever filmed, it's a classic among classics--simply put, one of the finest films ever made.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783222955", "6301797957", "6301976983", "6301964268", "6301562178", "6304935811", "1558807780", "6302656125", "6305081832", "0800132009", "6302360978", "6304119038", "6302226899", "0769403468", "6302091632", "0800113055", "6300181111", "6301976398", "6301586026", "6303393985", "6304039522", "630491010X", "6302816416", "6301802012", "6304071876", "6300268799", "0783235593", "6301966465", "630266232X", "B00005NQGQ", "6302503515", "6303364772", "6300182304", "6301798708", "6301734734", "6303560040", "B000003U12", "B0000068EE", "B00004RGUU", "6304028385", "6300181472", "6300267865", "6301973232", "B000BWIZTU", "6300216039", "B00000FZCU", "6301586042", "6302952581", "6302227127", "630248443X", "6300181340", "0783221347", "6300215962", "6302909023", "6302041090", "6302526167", "0792837916", "B00000F3QZ", "6301661850", "6302130379", "0792107128", "6302700949", "B000007PI4", "6302800897", "6303383009", "0792106989", "6300267970", "6300181154", "B00000F14D", "B00004WZR1", "630280096X", "1558035745", "6300215601", "6300215741", "6300215733", "0792107683", "6303696678", "0792108280", "6305718792"], "bought_together": ["0783222955"], "also_viewed": ["0790743531", "1558807780", "6304539258", "0783216084", "6303402070", "6304429274", "6301976983", "6305123616", "0792839846"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 144842}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.36, "brand": "Studio Classic", "asin": "6301797906", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Z8A6KK0BL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Grapes of Wrath  [VHS]"}
{"description": "It's set during the Korean War, in a mobile army surgical hospital. But no one seeingM*A*S*Hin 1970 confused the film for anything but a caustic comment on the Vietnam War; this is one of the counterculture movies that exploded into the mainstream at the end of the '60s. Director Robert Altman had labored for years in television and sporadic feature work when this smash-hit comedy made his name (and allowed him to create an astonishing string of offbeat pictures, culminating in the masterpieceNashville). Altman's style of cruel humor, overlapping dialogue, and densely textured visuals brought the material to life in an all-new kind of war movie (or, more precisely, antiwar movie). Audiences had never seen anything like it: vaudeville routines played against spurting blood, fueled with open ridicule of authority. The cast is led by Elliott Gould and Donald Sutherland, as the outrageous surgeons Hawkeye Pierce and Trapper John McIntyre, with Robert Duvall as the uptight Major Burns and Sally Kellerman in an Oscar-nominated role as nurse \"Hot Lips\" Houlihan. The film's huge success spawned the long-running TV series, a considerably softer take on the material; of the film's cast, only Gary Burghoff repeated his role on the small screen, as the slightly clairvoyant Radar O'Reilly.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B003ASLJS6", "B003ASLJRC", "B000003KHS", "6300215830", "6305576173"], "also_viewed": ["B001DMVZJ4", "B000HT3P5Q", "B001DMVZNK", "B000OT6V1E", "0792107128", "B001DMVZJO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 404206}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 0.44, "brand": "20th Century Fox", "asin": "6301777387", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51EFEZNDA0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "M*A*S*H [VHS]"}

Adapted from the bestselling novel by Colleen McCullough, the production stars  Richard Chamberlain as a Catholic priest named Ralph de Bricassart, whose  life in Australia between 1920 and 1962 is one long torment as he pines for his lover, Meggie Carson (Rachel Ward), while seeking advancement in his  clergyman career. The passion and the guilt make for compelling drama, but a stellar cast of supporting players adds muscle to the proceedings: Barbara  Stanwyck (who won an Emmy for her work as Meggie's tough grandmother), Jean Simmons, Richard Kiley, Christopher Plummer, Bryan Brown, and Mare  Winningham. Chamberlain, who was something of the king of the miniseries  form at the time, is very good in the lead, as is the often-underrated Ward.

Various distractions begin to enter his life, first in the form of a famous southern writer (John Mahoney) whom Fink idolizes, and then his neighbor in the hotel, a seemingly amiable salesman played by John Goodman (Sea of Love,Raising Arizona). The writer turns out to be a self-loathing drunk whose secretary (Judy Davis) is the one actually doing the writing. And the neighbor, the working-class hero who Fink made his reputation writing about, may have a horrifying secret of his own.

At times a wrenching character study with no easy answers, Courtenay's performance is a touching portrait of a young man and the journey he takes as he tries to run not only for an unclear future, but from a past he cannot forget.

{"description": "When Christopher Lee declined to reprise his role as Count Dracula in a sequel to the enormously popularThe Horror of Dracula, Hammer went another direction and instead followed the investigations of vampire hunter Van Helsing (Peter Cushing). He doesn't actually appear until the second act, after French schoolteacher Marianne (Yvonne Monlaur, a big eyed, thick-lipped, curvy young beauty in the Bardot mold) inadvertently releases Baron Meinster (David Peel), a young disciple of Dracula, from his castle prison in a cursed mountain village. This handsome vampire bites his way through a bevy of glamorous beauties in low-cut blouses and frilly nightgowns as he woos his sexy savior, while Van Helsing relentlessly tracks him back to Marianne. Director Terence Fisher, working from a rather convoluted (and at times incomprehensible) script, makes his mark  through a series of marvelous set pieces. In one of the most memorable, a twisted old woman plays midwife to a reborn undead, coaxing her out of the ground as hands push through the earth. In one harrowing moment Van Helsing sears his neck with a branding iron and treats it with holy water after being bitten. Cushing is his usual dashing self, more than making up for the handsome but hardly commanding Peel, and you might recognize Marita Hunt, who plays the withered Baroness, as Miss Haversham from David Lean's classicGreat Expectations.--Sean Axmaker", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 279896}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "title": "Brides of Dracula [VHS]", "related": {"also_bought": ["B006TTC5J0", "B000095J42", "6303149189", "1564427099", "630281474X", "6303626475", "6305063508", "B0001FVE9K", "0790736098"], "also_viewed": ["B0009X770O", "B00B94VJYW", "B00BPX7K5Y", "B003M8NGG2", "B000095J42", "B001B9ZVVC", "B00005NSXY", "B00C7ZBU6E", "B000U1ZV7G", "B00005LC4J", "B008HSK3PE", "B00000F62P", "155526509X", "B001YZU32A", "B00005KHJP"]}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514QBQN54BL._SY300_.jpg", "asin": "6302503507"}

{"description": "City Lightsis a film to pick for the time capsule, a film that best represents the many aspects of director-writer-star Charlie Chaplin at the peak of his powers: Chaplin the actor, the sentimentalist, the knockabout clown, the ballet dancer, the athlete, the lover, the tragedian, the fool. It's all contained in Chaplin's simple story of a tramp who falls in love with a blind flower girl (Virginia Cherrill). Chaplin elevates the Victorian contrivances of the plot to something glorious with his inventive use of pantomime and his sure grasp of how the Tramp relates to the audience. In 1931, it was a gamble for Chaplin to stick with silence after talking pictures had killed off the art form that had made him famous, but audiences flocked toCity Lightsanyway. (Chaplin would not make his first full talking picture until 1940'sThe Great Dictator.) After all the superb comic sequences, the film culminates with one of the most moving scenes in the history of cinema, a luminous and heartbreaking fade-out that lifts the picture onto another plane. (Woody Allen paid homage to the scene at the end ofManhattan.)

{"description": "Eddie Murphy makes a graceless debut as a romantic lead in this comedy from Reginald Hudlin. Murphy stars as a ladies man for whom the tables turn when he suddenly finds himself taken for granted by a lover (Robin Givens). Meanwhile, the platonic friend (Halle Berry) whom Murphy regularly visits is obviously--to the viewer, anyway--the woman he's supposed to be with. The absurdly long film is filled out with some fairly crude humor, such as the sight of Geoffrey Holder taking a whiff of Grace Jones's underwear. Yet Hudlin and Murphy also strain for a veneer of elegance and sophistication. Wanting to play it both ways, they end up with nothing. But there are several good sequences where Murphy is quite funny just being Murphy, such as his explanation to Berry of how you can tell which characters in an old episode ofStar Trekare destined to die.--Tom Keogh", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 307567}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 19.88, "brand": "", "asin": "6302620740", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/517J8614QTL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Boomerang [VHS]"}
{"description": "This black-and-white film adaptation of Tennessee Williams's Southern gothic play is perhaps more famous for the rumored off-screen shenanigans of its stars than for its over-the-top repressed sexuality (only Williams could pull off that paradox, and pull it off he does). Supposedly, stars Katharine Hepburn and Elizabeth Taylor battled for screen time; Hepburn warred very publicly with director Joseph Mankiewicz; and a postaccident Montgomery Clift relied heavily on painkillers and support from friend Taylor during the grueling shoot. Even this, however, cannot top the events of the film itself, revolving around the unseen playboy Sebastian and his mysterious death, which has something to do with young boys, a decadent European vacation, and Taylor in a provocative wet, white bathing suit. To give away the plot would spoil the fun, but suffice it to say that what Taylor saw was so horrible it drove her nuts, and Sebastian's mother (Hepburn) wants her to have a lobotomy in order to keep it from coming out; Clift is brought in to do the procedure. It's all a hoot and a holler, but as played by the two leading ladies (both of whom nabbed Oscar nominations), it's also compelling, chilling, and utterly gothic. Taylor gives a fierce performance, as the climaxing monologue that reveals Sebastian's \"secret\" rests entirely on her shoulders, and Hepburn plays brilliantly against type as Sebastian's manipulating, overbearing mother. Only Clift, saddled with a dreary character in charge of plot exposition, fails to deliver.

Full-screen presentation ofThe ShiningandFull Metal Jacketwas also approved by Kubrick, who recomposed his original framing,  reportedly believing that those films looked best on video in the full-screen format. (In fact, the original theatrical aspect ratio ofThe Shiningwas 1.66:1, meaning that a relatively small portion of the image is lost.) Kubrick also chose mono over stereo,  believing that inconsistencies in theatrical sound systems resulted in loss of control over theatrical presentation.

{"description": "This love story made in 1955 and set against the backdrop of war is a many-splendored thing: it features a drop-dead gorgeous Eurasian doctor seeking meaning in her life (Jennifer Jones), a dashing but married American war correspondent who's macho yet not afraid to declare his love (William Holden), and a couple of murky subplots to give their relationship its oh-what's-going-to-happen-next edge (her Chinese heritage, his wife, the outbreak of the Korean War). One scene builds beautifully upon the next, accompanied by dialogue that often sounds like poetry: \"I will make no mistakes in the name of loneliness,\" the doctor says near the beginning of their relationship.

{"description": "Jeff Bridges stars as an amateur boxer on a brief rise who catches the eye of an aging pugilist (Stacy Keach) heading downward in this 1972 film by John Huston and based on thenovelby  Leonard Gardner. Keach becomes the younger man's mentor, and the two hit central California's tanktown circuit of small matches for small money, interspersed with visits to smoke-filled bars and hellish gyms. Theirs is a cut-rate dream, all right, but as real and driving--and finally just as punishing--as the mythical black bird itself in Huston'sThe Maltese Falcon. The cast is outstanding, the cinematography by  Conrad Hall stunning, and the climax one of Huston's most painfully memorable. The story is filled out by surrounding detail that never leaves the memory: boxers and trainers who whisper of injuries that could put them out of business for good; a lone fighter who takes a bus into town, bides time in a crummy motel room, takes a beating in the ring, then leaves on the next bus with a few dollars in his pocket. This film helped re-establish Huston's reputation as a major filmmaker. It was followed by the likes ofThe Man Who Would Be King.--Tom Keogh", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 407924}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6302874807", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51PC6SK671L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Fat City [VHS]"}

{"description": "This sensational, extremely influential, 1974 low-budget horror movie directed by Tobe Hooper (Poltergeist,Lifeforce,Salem's Lot), may be notorious for its title, but it's also a damn fine piece of moviemaking. And it's blood-curdling scary, too. Loosely based on the true crimes of Ed Gein (also a partial inspiration forPsycho), the original Jeffrey Dahmer,Texas Chainsaw Massacrefollows a group of teenagers who pick up a hitchhiker and wind up in a backwoods horror chamber where they're held captive, tortured, chopped up, and impaled on meat hooks by a demented cannibalistic family, including a character known as Leatherface who maniacally wields one helluva chainsaw. The movie's powerful sense of dread is heightened by its grainy, semi-documentary style--but it also has a wicked sense of humor (and not that camp, self-referential variety that became so tiresome in subsequent horror films of the '70s, '80s, and '90s). OK, in case you couldn't tell, it's \"not for everyone.\" But as a landmark in the development of the horror/slasher genre, it ranks withPsycho,Halloween, andA Nightmare on Elm Street.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305095566", "0792839242", "B00023NRSM", "6304983794", "6300214087", "6300267881", "6300214311", "6300214192", "6302038308", "B00000G1XV", "0792846710", "0792836634", "1452114498", "0792839234", "B00A82A7ZS", "B00009W0TZ", "6304240562", "6300214605", "B00018D454", "0790705141", "B00000F6FN", "6300183416", "0783216084", "6302862787", "6300262855", "0780616561", "6300182770", "B0000065MW", "6300214656", "B00079Z9X2", "6301996127", "6300182878", "6304819927", "B00000IQUT", "6304509154", "6302844207", "6301969782", "0783235607", "6301094352", "6302798450", "6303031846", "B00000JQTO", "6300218058", "0783246641", "079284632X", "B0032GEL54", "6303442315", "6304370458", "630026999X", "6300263681", "6300214826", "B00000JLWQ", "630533580X", "6301961404", "0764005707", "B00007L4N7", "6304288433", "6300189015", "6303954278", "B000AMW2TK", "6301589025", "B0053TWVT6", "6302968143", "6302878772", "B0000039A6", "B00005ATQA", "B000006FZ0", "6305939616", "0780627032", "B000A0GOH8", "6303359345", "B00000JQTR"], "also_viewed": ["6300214087", "B00023NRSM", "0792839242", "B00018D454", "B00L22H2IS", "6305095566", "B00LLAV26O", "6300189015", "0792836634", "0800187164", "6301589955", "B000099T3M", "6304819927", "0780616561", "630428845X", "B00IF8Q0YE", "B0000039A6", "B000I2J68M", "6300214605", "B00BM4Q4N0", "6300214311", "6303917461", "6303506291", "630130053X", "B004RE29PO", "6304509154", "B000VKL6Z2", "B00BCMT2BI", "1452114498", "B003UGLCIA", "B00BCMSY80", "B000KJU1KK", "B002YICNE2", "0783235607", "B00C7C00JU", "B00DEQQK8S", "B00000IQUT", "B0057O6IDW", "6304983794", "B005J9ZE5I", "B00G5GNYY2", "B00JHH1VSW", "6300267881", "B002UR4GDI", "B000009NQY", "B001JFZ1UE", "B008CYDDWI", "0783216084", "B003JIPN20", "B009DA743Y", "B00DI012O2", "6301792734", "B002OVO18A", "6300182878", "6302517036", "B00LBFFR2Y"]}, "price": 24.95, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 183169}, "asin": "6302921058", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71DZX9N6ZZL._SY300_.gif", "title": "Texas Chainsaw Massacre [VHS]"}

He becomes the target of a female stalker (Sean Young, in a bit of typecasting), as well as the dupe in a murder plot involving his wife (Kate Nelligan).

(The film is not to be confused with Steven Spielberg's sequel toJurassic Park.) Just as Spielberg's dinosaur thrillers would advance the technology of computer-generated spectacle, Doyle's classic story provided a perfect opportunity to exploit the illusions made possible by stop-motion animation. Eight years before he stunned audiences with the amazing special effects ofKing Kong, pioneering stop-motion animator Willis O'Brien created the dinosaur stars of this classic silent-film fantasy. Following Doyle's plot, the film plays like a dress rehearsal forKing Kongand establishes a now-familiar scenario: Wallace Beery plays a visionary scientist who returns to the remote South African plateau where he'd earlier discovered a jungle haven of prehistoric creatures.  Determined to introduce this discovery to the world, he returns to London with a captive brontosaurus, which later escapes and goes on a destructive rampage through the city.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["630497342X"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 617027}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6303038786", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/214HP8TDKRL.jpg", "title": "Lost World [VHS]"}

{"description": "Wolfgang Petersen (In the Line of Fire) made his first English-language film with this 1984 fantasy about a boy (Barret Oliver) visualizing the stories of a book he's reading.

{"description": "The Coen brothers (Raising Arizona,Fargo) have become the most consistently original filmmakers in the land. In a salute/reworking of the fast-talking comedies of the '40s, we follow Norville Barnes (Tim Robbins) and his amazing rise to the top. But he's only a puppet for the evil Sidney J. Mussburger (Paul Newman), who wants the company for himself. The Coens' design is the real star, and their first big-budget film will stimulate movie fans. The story weakens in the middle, but you will find very few films that move with this much imagination. As a Kate Hepburn hybrid, Jennifer Jason Leigh is wonderful in an almost unplayable role.

{"description": "Peter Wintonick and Mark Achbar made this penetrating documentary about the career and views of linguist and media critic Noam Chomsky. While the man is the subject of the movie, the filmmakers wisely and carefully choose not to make Chomsky more important than his insights into the way print and electronic journalism tacitly and often willingly further the agendas of the powerful. We learn a lot about Chomsky's formative experiences as a child, student, academic, activist, and politician (he has campaigned for office), but we learn just as much about the media institutions that deny him access today, from ABC to PBS. The centerpiece of the film, arguably, is a long examination into the history of theNew York Times'coverage of Indonesia's atrocity-ridden occupation of East Timor, reportage that (as Chomsky shows us) was absolutely in lock step with the government's unwillingness to criticize an ally.--Tom Keogh", "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 501603}, "asin": "6303295576", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/215DKGJEGHL.jpg", "title": "Manufacturing Consent - Noam Chomsky and the Media [VHS]"}

{"description": "Edward D. Wood Jr. was an actor writer-director-producer, occasionally in drag, who combined meager bursts of talent with an undying optimism to create some of the most bizarrely memorable \"B\" movies to ever come out of Tinseltown. Though Wood died in obscurity as an alcoholic in 1978, his films have been considered cult classics for years. He is consistently voted the worst director who ever lived. You would think this an odd subject, but director Tim Burton harnesses the undying hopefulness that made Wood such a character. Shot in black and white, just like Wood's creations, this stylized, witty production captures the poetic absurdity of Wood's films and his unconventional life. Burton's recreation of Wood's wonderfully awfulPlan 9 from Outer Spacelooks much better than the original low-budget quickie. Burton tackled an extremely strange subject matter for a biopic, but Wood is presented as naive almost to the point of delusion, so the story works. The pace sags in the middle, as the weirdness starts to wear thin, but Depp proves himself an adroit actor, even while wearing angora and a blonde wig. Wood's unconventional repertoire company is faithfully reproduced, including an Academy Award-winning Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi. Landau is pathetic, droll, and charismatic as the elderly junkie who made his last screen appearances in Wood's films.--Rochelle O'Gorman", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301763041", "0800187873"], "bought_together": ["6301763041"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 314635}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.87, "brand": "", "asin": "6303407188", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51F97RJE9XL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Ed Wood [VHS]"}

{"description": "Kiss of the Spider Womanstarts out simply enough,  hemmed in by the narrow walls of a Latin American prison cell. Molina (William Hurt)  is telling his new cellmate, Valentin (Raul Julia), his favorite story.  Molina is a delicate homosexual imprisoned for seducing a minor; Valentin is a bearded revolutionary still bleeding from his interrogation. If their  film unfolded into the typical prison buddy plot, it'd still be a good  movie.  But this is a great movie. There are stories twisting within stories,  each drawing a new, surprising level of difference between the two heroes: escapism versus realism, romance versus politics, gay versus straight,  hero versus coward. As their unstable friendship grows more real, their  stories become more vivid--whether Molina's fondly remembered Nazi propaganda noir, Valentin's tortured romantic history, or a tropical island fable told merely to pass the time. (Each substory stars Sonia Braga, a neat bit  of casting that further blurs the line between fantasy and reality.) By  the end, each man has changed just enough to taste the other's tragedy--a transformation that gives each the strength to define freedom on his  own terms, despite the brutality of the prison and the bleak world beyond  its walls.--Grant Balfour", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 442844}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.99, "brand": "", "asin": "630383258X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GZ6D65C6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Kiss of the Spider Woman [VHS]"}
{"description": "Despite its title, forget about finding this controversial drama on the Vatican's screening list. The film explores a provocative checklist of religious taboos--celibacy, incest, sexual abuse, homosexuality, the debatable secrecy of the confessional--as director Antonia Bird delivers a bold condemnation of what she views as the outdated politics and harmful nature of Catholic doctrine. The story concerns the ideologically strained relationship between two clergymen, the misleading conservative Father Greg (Linus Roache) and his older and more practical colleague, Father Matthew (Tom Wilkinson). Upon arriving at his new Liverpool parish, Greg is shocked to learn that Matthew ignores celibacy and openly sleeps with his black housekeeper. Greg chooses to satisfy his earthly desires in a more secretive way. Sometimes, he likes to lose the cloth, grab a leather jacket, and pick up guys at the local gay pub. He's got other problems as well. While torturing himself with his own moral dilemma, he's hit with another, as during confession a young girl confides that her father is sexually abusing her at home. While this drags out the old \"bound by secrecy\" clich&eacute; of many religious melodramas, Bird uses it to bolster her theme of unwarranted secrecy in the face of faith and social scorn. Ultimately, both the priest and the girl are victims of their own fear, and must find courage to destroy it. Thankfully, Bird's wicked sense of humor keeps the film's tone from slipping into saccharine sentimentality, while Roache's intense performance and a honest, shattering finale rescue the film from swerving too far into shallow TV movie-of-the-week sensationalism.--Dave McCoy", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 487666}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.94, "brand": "", "asin": "6303908586", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41BFKD8D8GL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Priest [VHS]"}
{"description": "This film represents Hugh Grant's first big bid at Hollywood stardom, on the heels of the success ofFour Weddings and a Funeral. But he stumbled twice: first with this mundane comedy, then by being arrested after soliciting a prostitute near downtown Hollywood, the week before the film opened. Directed by Chris Columbus (Mrs. Doubtfire),Nine Monthswas a weak reworking of a French film about an aging bachelor (Grant)  who can't decide whether to commit to the woman he loves (Julianne Moore). When she becomes pregnant, he still can't make up his mind and winds up blowing hot and cold on the subject of fatherhood, which causes tension in the relationship. There's a lot of low comedy involving Grant's best friend; Tom Arnold plays this ultra-married and child-ridden suburbanite, who makes fatherhood look like a living hell. Robin Williams has a funny cameo as a foreign doctor, but in the end, the sentiment is ladled on and Grant doesn't have nearly enough funny material to work with.--Marshall Fine", "related": {"also_viewed": ["6303100864"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 513846}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 0.94, "brand": "", "asin": "6303890458", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41QM231ZPRL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Nine Months [VHS]"}

{"description": "After Martin Scorsese went to Hollywood in 1972 to direct the low-budgetBoxcar Berthafor B-movie mogul Roger Corman, the young director showed the film to maverick director John Cassavetes and got an instant earful of urgent advice. \"It's crap,\" said Cassavetes in no uncertain terms, \"now go out and make something that comes from your heart.\" Scorsese took the advice and focused his energy onMean Streets, a riveting contemporary film about low-life gangsters in New York's Little Italy that critic Pauline Kael would later call \"a true original, and a triumph of personal filmmaking.\" Starring Robert De Niro and Harvey Keitel in roles that announced their talent to the world, it set the stage for Scorsese's emergence as one of the greatest American filmmakers. Introducing themes and character types that Scorsese would return to inTaxi Driver,GoodFellas,Casino, and other films, the loosely structured story is drawn directly from Scorsese's background in the Italian neighborhoods of New York, and it seethes with the raw vitality of a filmmaker who has found his creative groove. As the irresponsible and reckless Johnny Boy, De Niro offers striking contrast to Keitel's Charlie, who struggles to reconcile gang life with Catholic guilt. More of an episodic portrait than a plot-driven crime story,Mean Streetsremains one of Scorsese's most direct and fascinating films--a masterful calling card for a director whose greatness was clearly apparent from that point forward.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0790733927", "6302842263", "630026887X", "B000005PPB", "6302816629", "6301564456"], "also_viewed": ["6302066891", "6303534368"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 426972}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6304457375", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51CA63GNNXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Mean Streets [VHS]"}

{"description": "Phil Tucker'sRobot Monsterhas rightfully earned a place in the  pantheon of bad movies over the years, and for good reason--it makes anything  done by Ed Wood look like an Orson Welles masterpiece. Picture, if you will, a  gorilla in a diving helmet (the Ro-Man) who wipes out all of the Earth's  population except for one family (the Hu-Mans), whom he terrorizes through the  rest of the film. From his headquarters in a Bronson Canyon cave, he  communicates with his superiors via World War&nbsp;II surplus radio gear and a  Lawrence Welk-style bubble machine, then shambles around the woods looking for  his quarry. The plot of this post-holocaust sci-fi nonsense is hardly worth  going into past that point, except to say that it's stupendously, staggeringly  awful filmmaking. It's even more incredible when you consider that the writers  and director undoubtedly believed that they were making a deep, serious, grave  statement about the horrors of nuclear war... and wound up with several reels of  celluloid flotsam. Any self-respecting fan of bad cinema who hasn't seen this  notorious wreck of a movie isn't worth his or her salt. Poor Phil Tucker--whenRobot Monsterwas released, it received such a thorough shellacking that  he tried to commit suicide. Tucker failed, though, and went on to make the even  less comprehensibleBroadway Jungleand the marginally betterCape  Canaveral Monsters.--Jerry Renshaw", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302157323"], "bought_together": ["6302157323"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 879184}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.96, "brand": "", "asin": "6304680708", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51V6W2FX4DL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Robot Monster [VHS]"}

{"description": "Halloweenis as pure and undiluted as its title.  In the small town of Haddonfield, Illinois, a teenage baby sitter  tries to survive a Halloween night of relentless terror, during which  a knife-wielding maniac goes after the town's hormonally charged  youths. Director John Carpenter takes this simple situation and  orchestrates a superbly mounted symphony of horrors. It's a movie much scarier for its dark spaces and ominous camera movements  than for its explicit bloodletting (which is actually minimal). Composed  by Carpenter himself, the movie's freaky music sets the tone; and his  script (cowritten with Debra Hill) is laced with references to other  horror pictures, especiallyPsycho. The baby sitter is played  by Jamie Lee Curtis, the real-life daughter ofPsychovictim  Janet Leigh; and the obsessed policeman played by Donald Pleasence  is named Sam Loomis, after John Gavin's character inPsycho.  In the end, though,Halloweenstands on its own as an  uncannily frightening experience--it's one of those movies that had  audiences literally jumping out of their seats and shouting at the  screen. (\"No! Don't drop that knife!\") Produced on a low budget,  the picture turned a monster profit, and spawned many sequels,  none of which approached the 1978 original. Curtis returned for two  more installments: 1981's dismalHalloween II, which picked  up the story the day after the unfortunate events, and 1998's occasionally  grippingHalloween H20, which proved the former baby sitter  was still haunted after 20 years.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005LC4Q", "B000FA57UI", "B000FA57US", "B000Q66Q2O", "B005CFC0N8", "B004P7CNUY", "B0000AOX09", "B004P7CM9Q", "B000VKL6Z2", "B00006LPHA", "B002XD0J80", "B00AQJ8MLY", "B001NPD9LS", "B002YICNE2", "B000GETUDI", "B000FS9FE4", "B001DJLD1W", "B00AEFY2LO", "B00006FI0R", "B00AEFY2WI", "B005CFBYW6", "B00006FDBT", "B00AEFY31S", "B00AEFY37C", "B00005K3NR", "B00004TS0G", "B003UGLCIA", "B0087ZG7UW", "B000I2J68M", "B000V4UFZK", "B0000VCZMK", "B0033B5XCS", "B000AM6OQ2", "B0002JP572", "B002VWNIDG", "B0058S0OMS", "B000099T3M", "B00AEFY1V0", "B002ZG971U", "B00AEFYYH6", "B00003CXCF", "B004LWZW2O", "B001B1UO6W", "B00006FDCD", "B000E1ZBIG", "B004SIP9MY", "B000TSIJWY", "B000WC3864", "B004AC6PMG", "B001DJLD0S", "B000QQJ3Q0", "B004P7CMT6", "B0002CHK1S", "B000FC2GA0", "B008CYDD7I", "B0008191WO", "B0024FADD8", "B0053TWVDC", "B00018D42W", "B00AEFY2AA", "B00DTPRZ24", "B000KJU1KK", "B00AEFY2E6", "B0000CEB6Y", "B0006SGYL0", "B00004Y87O", "B0013D8LAE", "B00005JA8B", "B006ZL1P66", "B000GBEWRU", "B000IMUYJM", "B005J9ZFQG", "B001JFZ1UE", "B007STBUHI", "B000E8M0P6", "6305972001", "B00079Z9WI", "B00005A8XX", "B00009PY4G", "B000FAOC2W", "B000AA4JL6", "B0002C4JJ4", "B0002O7XW2", "B008JFUNYG", "B000HEWEGC", "B002LMSWN2", "B00BM4Q4H6", "B000HCO86I", "B008874968", "0783227434", "B0006SSOHC", "B001JFZ122", "B004LWZW24", "B000Q66Q8I", "B00001QGUM", "B000OYCMLM", "B000PMLJMQ", "B00000ILDD", "B00A1AU72A", "B004SIP9E2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00KDU8HQQ", "B00005LC4Q", "B000VKL6Z2", "B002YICNE2"]}, "price": 19.96, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 349265}, "asin": "6304697961", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51NXT68J3CL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Halloween"}

{"description": "The curiosity of Quentin Tarantino'sJackie Brownis Robert Forster's worldly wise bail bondsman Max Cherry, the most alive character in this adaptation of Elmore Leonard'sRum Punch. The Academy Awards saw it the same way, giving Forster the film's only nomination. The film is more \"rum\" than \"punch\" and will certainly disappoint those who are looking for Tarantino's trademark style. This movie is a slow, decaffeinated story of six characters glued to a half million dollars brought illegally into the country. The money belongs to Ordell (Samuel&nbsp;L. Jackson), a gunrunner just bright enough to control his universe and do his own dirty work. His just-paroled friend--a loose term with Ordell--Louis (Robert De Niro) is just taking up space and could be interested in the money. However, his loyalties are in question between his old partner and Ordell's doped-up girl (Bridget Fonda). Certainly Fed Ray Nicolette (Michael Keaton) wants to arrest Ordell with the illegal money. The key is the title character, a late-40s-ish flight attendant (Pam Grier) who can pull her own weight and soon has both sides believing she's working for them. The end result is rarely in doubt, and what is left is two hours of Tarantino's expert dialogue as he moves his characters around town.Tarantino changed the race of Jackie and Ordell, a move that means little except that it allows Tarantino to heap on black culture and language, something he has a gift and passion for. He said this film is for an older audience although the language and drug use may put them off. The film is not a salute to Grier's blaxploitation films beyond the musical score. Unexpectedly the most fascinating scenes are between Grier and Forster: two neo-stars glowing in the limelight of their first major Hollywood film after decades of work.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000X81ZI", "6303953425", "B00006G8O1", "B000286RJI", "6304106017", "B000067DGJ", "6305095566", "B0000633ZP", "6302968100", "6302816580", "B000056V73", "630504077X", "630300394X"], "bought_together": ["B0000X81ZI"], "also_viewed": ["B009B0OG1O", "630268644X", "6300183211"]}, "price": 9.85, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 236793}, "asin": "6305006598", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71GXP626B7L._SY300_.gif", "title": "Jackie Brown [VHS]"}

{"description": "The definitive American television series of the '90s comes to the big screen with an anticlimactic whimper. And how could it be otherwise? Why should material so perfectly realized in one medium necessarily translate well into another? The series is crisply and thoughtfully executed in just about every detail, but the heart of its appeal lies in the elegant handling of complicated and evolving ongoing story lines, which is not something movies are especially good at. The big-screen drive for closure cramps the creative style, though it may also help nonfans get a grip on the proceedings. We do get some invigorating thrills and chills, however, and a more satisfying sense of the scale of an all-enveloping human-alien conspiracy than ever before, but there's no more plot development here than in an average two-part season-ending. FBI black sheep Mulder and Scully have been temporarily transferred from the X-Files project to an anti-terrorist unit to investigate an Oklahoma City-style bombing. They uncover a new wrinkle in the Syndicate/Cancer Man conspiracy--basically an attempt to help one bunch of (benign?) aliens fight off another bunch who want to colonize Earth. A spectacular, ice-bound finale thrillingly staged by series-veteran director Rob Bowman offers Mulder (but not a conveniently unconscious Scully) his first clear look at a You Know What, which in some quarters qualifies as an epochal event. Martin Landau offers the agents some crucial clues, and several familiar TV faces (including the Lone Gunmen and Mitch Pileggi's indispensable Assistant Director Skinner) turn up briefly to wink knowingly at faithful fans.--David Chute", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B001FACH7S", "B001G7PSZI", "B000UZDO5I", "6303402348", "080010367X"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 338484}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.95, "brand": "20th Century Fox", "asin": "6305142467", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41GEJ8WNSKL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The X-Files (Movie) [VHS]"}

{"description": "Werner Herzog's remake of F.W. Murnau'soriginal vampire classicis at once a generous tribute to the great German director and a distinctly unique vision by one of cinema's most idiosyncratic filmmakers. Though Murnau'sNosferatuwas actually an unauthorized adaptation of Bram  Stoker'sDracula, Herzog based his film largely on Murnau's conceptions--at times directly quoting Murnau's images--but manages to slip in a few references to Tod Browning'sfamous version(at one point the vampire comments on the howling wolves: \"Listen, the children of the night make their music.\"). Longtime Herzog star Klaus Kinski is both hideous and melancholy as Nosferatu (renamed Count Dracula in the English language version). As in Murnau's film, he's a veritable gargoyle with his bald pate and sunken eyes, and his talon-like fingernails and two snaggly fangs give him a distinctly feral quality. But Kinski's haunting eyes also communicate a gloomy loneliness--the curse of his undead immortality--and his yearning for Lucy (Isabelle Adjani) becomes a melancholy desire for love. Bruno Ganz's sincere but foolish Jonathan is doomed to the vampire's will and his wife, Lucy, a holy innocent whose deathly pallor and nocturnal visions link her with the ghoulish Nosferatu, becomes the only hope against the monster's plague-like curse. Herzog's dreamy, delicate images and languid pacing create a stunningly beautiful film of otherworldly mood, a faithful reinterpretation that by the conclusion has been shaped into a quintessentially Herzog vision.--Sean Axmaker", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 272814}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "title": "Nosferatu the Vampyre [VHS]", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000056NW6", "6302783356", "B000VUQ4HW", "6304509154"], "also_viewed": ["6302194296", "B00EO2I6RO"]}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5123FXMFFAL._SY300_.jpg", "asin": "630526323X"}

{"description": "Italy's rubber-faced funnyman Roberto Benigni accomplishes the  impossible in his World War&nbsp;II comedyLife Is Beautiful: he shapes a  simultaneously hilarious and haunting comedy out of the tragedy of the Holocaust. An international sensation and the most successful foreign language film in U.S. history, the picture also earned director-cowriter-star Benigni Oscars for Best Foreign Language Film and Best Actor. He plays the Jewish country boy Guido, a madcap romantic in Mussolini's Italy who wins the heart of his sweetheart (Benigni's real-life sweetie, Nicoletta Braschi) and raises a darling son (the adorable Giorgio Cantarini) in the shadow of fascism. When the Nazis ship the men off to a concentration camp in the waning days of the war, Guido is determined to shelter his son from the evils around them and convinces him they're in an elaborate contest to win (of all things) a tank. Guido tirelessly maintains the ruse with comic ingenuity, even as the horrors escalate and the camp's population continues to dwindle--all the more  impetus to keep his son safe, secure, and, most of all, hidden. Benigni walks a fine line mining comedy from tragedy and his efforts are pure fantasy--he accomplishes feats no man could realistically pull off--both of  which have drawn fire from a few critics. Yet for all its wacky humor and inventive gags,Life Is Beautifulis a moving and poignant tale of one father's sacrifice to save not just his young son's life but his innocence in the face of one of the most evil acts ever perpetrated by the human race.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B003JLL2RW", "B00007G25J", "B00000493Q", "6300216012", "0800100832"], "bought_together": ["B003JLL2RW"], "also_viewed": ["B0033PQUXA", "B00B0U2SEA", "B004SEUJ82", "6305291403", "0784011710", "B0010YSD7W", "B00AYXEW0C", "B000HEWEJO", "B000FVQLRA", "B0002CX1NY", "6303215734", "0783233477", "B00AEFY0F2"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 290895}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.96, "brand": "", "asin": "6305426651", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51W27JXJYQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Life Is Beautiful (La Vita E Bella) [VHS]"}
{"description": "One of the most endearing and intelligent romantic comedies of the '90s, the Oscar-winningShakespeare in Loveis filled with such good will, sunny romance, snappy one-liners, and devilish cleverness that it's absolutely irresistible. With tongue placed firmly in cheek, at its outset the film tracks young Will Shakespeare's overwrought battle with writer's block and the efforts of theater owner Philip Henslowe (Geoffrey Rush, in rare form) to stage Will's latest comedy,Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter. Jokey comedy, though, soon takes a backseat to ravishing romance when the beautiful Viola De Lesseps (Gwyneth Paltrow) disguises herself as a young man to wangle herself an audition in the all-male cast, and wins both the part of Romeo and, after much misunderstanding, the playwright's heart. Soon enough, Will's pirate comedy becomes the beautiful, tragicRomeo and Juliet, reflecting the agony and ecstasy of Will and Viola's romance--he's married and she's set to marry the slimy Lord Wessex (Colin Firth) in the near future.The way that Oscar-winning screenwriters Marc Norman and Tom Stoppard enfold their story within the parameters ofRomeo and Juliet(and evenTwelfth Night) is nothing short of brilliant--it would take a Shakespearean scholar to dissect the innumerable parallels, oft-quoted lines, plot developments, and thematic borrowings. And most amazingly, Norman and Stoppard haven't forgotten to entertain their audience in addition to riding a Shakespearean roller coaster, with director John Madden (Mrs. Brown) reigning in his huge ensemble with rollicking energy. Along the way there are small gems to be found, including Judi Dench's eight-minute, Oscar-winning turn as atrulyregal Queen Elizabeth, but the key element ofShakespeare in Love's success rests on the milky-white shoulders of its two stars. Fiennes, inexplicably overlooked at Oscar time, is a dashing, heartfelt Will, and as for Best Actress winner Paltrow, well, nothing she'd done before could have prepared viewers for how amazing she is here. Breathtakingly beautiful, fiercely intelligent, strong-willed, and lovestruck--it's a performance worthy of Shakespeare in more ways than one. By the film's end, you'll be thoroughly won over--and brushing up your Shakespeare with newfound ardor.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["0790734060", "6304071876"], "also_viewed": ["B00006FN65"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 406033}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.72, "brand": "", "asin": "6305470448", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Q5DABSM6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Shakespeare in Love [VHS]"}

{"description": "There's a killer on the loose who's murdering and mutilating beautiful young college girls, and there's no shortage of suspects. Four comely coeds decide to escape the madness by vacationing in an isolated country villa, but the maniac has his eye on them--one of them suspects his identity--and drops in for a homicidal holiday. With a title likeTorsoyou know what you're getting, but despite the high body count and the suggestion of dismemberment, most of the gore in this Italiangiallois offscreen... with a few exceptions (an icky eye gouging stands out). Director Sergio Martino is no Dario Argento and the film is blunt, direct, and vicious, as can be seen when the killer disposes of a witness by ramming his skull into a brick wall with his car, not once but twice (with the  appropriate close-up). The killer, who hides behind a ratty ski mask and strangles his targets with a florid scarf, is haunted by some obscure childhood memory involving a porcelain doll and a traumatizing accident. He straddles two clich&eacute;s, the Norman Bates-variety psychos and the hooded, zombielike automatons ofHalloweenandFriday the 13th. It doesn't make much sense, but like most slasher films, it's really about suspense, spectacle, and a body count, and Martino doesn't disappoint. To restore the film, Anchor Bay has included a few brief scenes in Italian with English subtitles.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004KDYR20", "B002E01MHY", "B000KRNG54", "B000S0GYRK", "B000096I9V", "B004FUPK6U", "B000V6LT6C", "B0036R92US", "B000JU7JIW", "B0007WQHI0", "B0002Y69VI", "B000MV8ZCW", "B001D5C1R6", "B0012IV3S2", "B001D5C1OO", "B0002C9DK4", "B000S0GYRU", "B000E41MTU", "B000096I9W", "B0057O6IMS", "B00000JT2R", "B000YKI4T0", "B000KRNG4A", "B001AR0D6I", "B000S0GYRA", "B000TZJCMS", "B000HXDWNM", "B000B64TZK", "B000TZJCN2", "B007ATHNR2", "B005ZHBEPI", "B000YKI4U4", "B00DOZNGTK", "B000TZJCNM", "B00HRUQB8Q", "B000MV8ZDQ", "B000TZJCNC", "B00E5S2HGS", "B000S0GYS4", "B004H0M34A", "B0002C9DJU", "B003L1YESE", "B0024R1R8G", "1598830392", "B00GRZPRB4", "B00005U12U", "B000BB1926", "B00ARWX9NG", "B0002VYOVS", "B009IV2Z3M", "B00JV054CO", "B001LIK8DO", "B003THSXJ6", "B00JV054A6", "B000GIXCLA", "B000B64TZA", "B00CPTUNUG", "B00000IBRJ", "B000TZJCNW", "B00FUABJJQ", "B000795JMS", "B000RPCJA2", "B005CVFZ66", "B0002Y69V8", "B007XF0XT8", "B008NA3I1W", "B0015D3YRM", "B00009WNXA", "B008H1Q3JG", "B000096I9X", "B0002C9DJK", "B006HLBCDA", "B001B1Q3LM", "B00ESZZOMM", "B009R68H80", "B003VE9WU6", "B00ESZZOLI", "B003NEQ74S", "B000E41MTA", "B000092T69", "B0002IQLH6", "B00B94VJYW", "B0089AJDNS", "B002TLRG6E", "B000AC7P5Q", "B000HXDWRS", "B0012IV3SC", "B000GIXCLK", "B00E3H3CO2", "B00026PA70", "B00JQYV0B4", "B007XF0XSE", "B0002DB5PO", "B000YKI4TA", "B001B1Q3LC", "B000IMUYJM", "B0072GPQ8G", "B000E41MT0", "B000T28POC", "B000WC38EQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004KDYR20", "B002E01MHY", "B000V6LT6C", "B004FUPK6U"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 303519}, "asin": "630579720X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/513SFHK6K9L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Torso"}
{"description": "After years of dominating the midnight circuit with the likes ofNight of the Living Dead,Martin, andDawn of the Dead,  George&nbsp;A. Romero took a departure from bona fide horror films to make this naturalistic tale of a traveling troupe of motorcycle-riding jousters. (ThinkHell's Angels on Wheelsgoes to the Renaissance Faire.) While this may sound ludicrous on the surface, the film emerges as a powerful character study. When the success of their jousting tournaments--in which armor-clad bikers go at each other with real lances for the entertainment of county fair crowds--attracts the attention of bigtime promoters, creeping commercialism threatens to spoil their delicately constructed Camelot. The troupe is a mirror of King Arthur's court, complete with its King (Ed Harris), Merlin (Brother Blue), and Morgan le&nbsp;Fay (Tom Savini). Only they ride motorcycles, and try to knock each other off with maces. Ed Harris turns in a topnotch performance as Billy, the focus of the film, who goes progressively nuts as it becomes apparent he's losing his grip on the troupe (unconsciously playing out the final days of Camelot).Knightridersis thoroughly engrossing during the jousting tournaments and whenever Ed Harris is onscreen, but is less successful in-between, when toeing the line of the Arthurian Legend makes the film too mannered.

{"description": "Generally acknowledged as a bona fide classic, this Francis Ford Coppola film is one of those rare experiences that feels perfectly right from beginning to end--almost as if everyone involved had been born to participate in it. Based on Mario Puzo's bestselling novel about a Mafia dynasty, Coppola'sGodfatherextracted and enhanced the most universal themes of immigrant experience in America: the plotting-out of hopes and dreams for one's successors, the raising of children to carry on the good work, etc. In the midst of generational strife during the Vietnam years, the film somehow struck a chord with a nation fascinated by the metamorphosis of a rebellious son (Al Pacino) into the keeper of his father's dream. Marlon Brando played against Puzo's own conception of patriarch Vito Corleone, and time has certainly proven the actor correct. The rest of the cast, particularly James Caan, John Cazale, and Robert Duvall as the rest of Vito's male brood--all coping with how to take the mantle of responsibility from their father--is seamless and wonderful.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["630021639X", "6302158176", "6300183211", "6304214502", "6300214826", "0790705141", "6303168507", "0790733927", "B00003CXE6", "630470786X", "6300267997", "0790741512", "6303471501", "6300271331", "6302054982", "6303686796", "B00005PJ8I", "B00004COR2", "0792842111", "6304258984", "6304509146", "0783216084", "6300215644", "6300216500", "B000062XM6", "0800199421", "B0002F6BQU", "0800116917", "630336568X", "6304508611", "B00000F13T", "6304935811", "6305363668", "B000005PFL", "6300182878", "0792116887", "6300182452", "B00005B238", "0792845684", "6300247171", "0792839846", "6302482712", "6302989787", "0790732017", "0800100832", "630442972X", "6304196954", "B000065U6Q", "6301208773", "B00000K2SC", "6302842263", "6304429274", "6303313345", "B0000A36J1", "B000059XY5", "079212569X"], "bought_together": ["630021639X", "6302158176"], "also_viewed": ["6302610702", "630021639X", "6301792734", "6303402348", "6300215830", "6304117752", "6300183211", "6302158176", "B00COYZF5A", "6300214060", "B000NTPDSW", "6305095566", "0792151712", "6305169187", "6303953425", "080010367X", "6302054982", "6301208773", "B000KX0ISG", "630310696X", "6302415853", "6304214502", "B00005B238", "6303168507", "B00E9PMMX0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 270877}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.98, "brand": "", "asin": "B000003KHS", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/11KQ3QC757L.jpg", "title": "The Godfather [VHS]"}
{"description": "The 1988 sequel to one of the most successful movies of all time finds Eddie Murphy reprising his role as Detroit police detective Axel Foley, and once again playing a fish out of water as he tries to solve a series of heists in Beverly Hills that may be connected to the attempted murder of his friend, a Beverly Hills police captain (Ronny Cox). Constructed in a much flashier and faster-paced visual style than the first film, the song still remains the same as Foley tries to keep his job in Detroit while solving crimes for the Beverly Hills cops. Murphy again makes the most of culture shock for comic effect, and the easy rapport between Murphy and Billy (Judge Reinhold), now a cheerfully over the topRambo-esque figure, is still the centerpiece of this series.

{"description": "Yasujiro Ozu's economical style reaches its zenith in this deceptively simple 1953 story of an elderly couple in rural Japan who go to visit their married children in Tokyo. Chishu Ryo (Ozu's favorite performer) and Chieko Higashiyama star as the aging parents who find a cold welcome waiting for them from their two urbanized children, too busy with work and their own lives to pay them any attention. After a miserable trip to a noisy spa, the mother spends a pleasant night with the widow of their other son (who had died in the war) while the father drinks the evening away with old friends. But on their return trip, the mother falls ill and the family reunites one last time at her sickbed. Within this simple framework, Ozu creates a quiet but profound drama of the changing face of Japanese culture and the loss of traditional values in modern society. Described by critics as Japan's most \"Japanese\" director, Ozu's style by this time had become firmly established: the entire film is shot from an unmoving camera 36 inches from the floor (the point of view of an observer kneeling on a tatami mat), edited in a subtly off-center manner and paced at a placid tempo. Ozu's graceful style, understated direction, and rich evocation of character creates an elegantly realized world of dignity in the face of disappointment and loss.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302969425"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 552474}, "asin": "B000006D1S", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51QX2HMS9CL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Tokyo Story [VHS]"}

{"description": "EDITOR'S NOTE: According to a Warner Home Video technician involved in  the production ofThe Stanley Kubrick Collection, Kubrick authorized all aspects of theCollection, from the use of Digital Component Video (or \"D-1\") masters originally approved in 1989, to the use of minimalist screen menus, chapter stops, and (in the case of2001: A Space OdysseyandThe Shiningon DVD) supplementary materials. Full-screen presentation ofThe ShiningandFull Metal Jacketwas also approved by Kubrick, who recomposed his original framing,  reportedly believing that those films looked best on video in the full-screen format. (In fact, the original theatrical aspect ratio ofThe Shiningwas 1.66:1, meaning that a relatively small portion of the image is lost.) Kubrick also chose mono over stereo,  believing that inconsistencies in theatrical sound systems resulted in loss of control over theatrical presentation. In every respect, the Warner spokesman  said, the films in theCollectionremain as Kubrick approved them. Any future attempt to remaster or alter them would  have to be approved by an appointee of the Kubrick estate.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00366F2NU", "B000UJ48SQ", "0792841409", "B005152C9G", "B000055Y0X", "B0013D8LKO", "0783226039", "B004L9GMBC", "B00005ATQB", "0792841387", "B007K8ILTW", "B000P0J09C", "B0000AUHQ6", "B000063JDE", "B002VWNIDG", "B001IHJ988", "B000EBD9TE", "B000EBD9SU", "B000UJCAKY", "B001FOK70S", "0679727299", "B00005JKJA", "B00004TWZH", "B00006RCNV", "B001LXIDUY", "0679723161", "6305999872", "B0087ZG7OI", "B00DW5IKYS", "B008RO875Q", "B0045HCJ94", "B0013FSXT6", "B00005JKGX", "B00AEBB89C", "B0087ZG7UW", "0767830555", "B0020LH8WU", "B0050FXDDQ", "B0057UA486", "B0045HCJ8U", "B000UJCAKO", "B0009S4J3M", "B0041KKYEM", "B001152TL6", "B00009W5CA", "B00C3ALLDA", "B00AEFXN9G", "B001FZQOW2", "B00000IREA", "B0000DJZ8Q", "B00005U2KC", "B0087ZG7R0", "B0010AN7Z4", "B007Y1NR1W", "B005Z9MGRG", "B00005QAPH", "B008BFSMBA", "B004NWPY20", "B00003CXBU", "B00AEFXESQ", "B007Y1NNAW", "B00079Z9VO", "B00K8HAIAW", "B003ELKNH2", "B0082CWTSY", "B001TIQT70", "B00062IVM6", "B005KQVE1S", "0783230559", "B0000549B1", "B000CNESU8", "B00004XPPK", "B00008RH3J", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B000QQFKYE", "B000EXDSCA", "B00AEFYSEA", "B00009MEKJ", "B000VLCRCW", "B002VWNICC", "B003VA3JTK", "B0045HCJ9O", "B00003CXCF", "078323502X", "B0010YVCI4", "B00BTYU3SK", "B00006ADD5", "B002LYD2MG", "B006TTC5HC", "B0009A40ES", "B00026L8US", "B008MIMWP8", "B0000DI87S", "B003O7I6SE", "B009POCG0Y", "B00000CQJZ", "B000G8NXYG", "B001PYD0LG", "6304907729"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00366F2NU", "B000UJ48SQ", "B0013D8LKO", "B000UJ48T0"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 158378}, "asin": "B00000J2KV", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/714ZK0VSVBL._SY300_.gif", "title": "Lolita"}

{"description": "Gosh--kids. You gotta love 'em, right? Well, not necessarily-- particularly if you're Adam Sandler. ButBig Daddyis about paternal devotion in its own oblique way. Sandler plays Sonny Koufax, a law-school grad who has been milking an accident settlement to cover his living expenses, while he continues to slack his way through life. But when his girlfriend threatens to dump him, he decides to show her he's serious about their relationship and pretends to adopt a little boy (in fact, his roommate's son from a one-night stand several years earlier, who shows up on their doorstep just after the roommate leaves town on a job). But after taking care of the tyke for a couple of days, Sonny finds that it's a little like feeding that stray dog that followed you home: Before you know it, you've grown attached to the little fella--and then what are you going to do? By turns crude and maudlin,Big Daddyhas its share of laughs and will certainly entertain fans who like Adam Sandler best when he plays the case of arrested development with a smart-aleck retort for everything.--Marshall Fine", "related": {"bought_together": ["6303610811", "0788816454"], "also_viewed": ["B00005JL93", "B00006IJDA", "B0090SI53C", "0788812807", "155890641X"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 69715}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 0.49, "brand": "", "asin": "B00000K3UR", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51XEBBHCTQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Big Daddy [VHS]"}

{"description": "With this magnificent Criterion DVD release, Luchino Visconti's 1963 historical dramaThe Leopardwill finally earn widespread recognition as one of the most beautiful epics ever produced. In adapting the popularnovelby Giuseppe Tomassi di Lampedusa (an Italian equivalent toGone with the Wind, set during the tumultuous Garibaldi revolution of 1860-62), Visconti was initially reluctant to cast Burt Lancaster as the melancholy Prince of Salina--the aging aristocrat \"leopard\" of the title--who accepts change as inevitable during the struggle for a unified Italy. But Lancaster (even with his voice dubbed in the fully restored Italian release) delivered one of his finest performances, modeled after Visconti himself, and reacting to political and familial upheavals with the wisdom and whimsy of a man who knows that his way of life--and all he holds dear--must change with the times. You won't find a more intimate epic, and Giusseppe Rotunno's masterful cinematography represents the pinnacle of painterly beauty, matched only by the authentic splendor of the film's impeccable production design. The climactic hourlong ballroom scene--which even the hard-to-please Pauline Kael called \"one of the greatest of all passages in movies\"--is utterly breathtaking. Anchored by Lancaster's performance and the romantic pairing of Alain Delon and Claudia Cardinale,The Leopardis sheer perfection, fully restored to its 185-minute glory.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0375714790", "B003VA3JTK", "B00782O7LG", "B004CIIXDC", "B001NH4CIA", "B0012KOM6K", "067940757X", "B009DA73WG", "B001LMU1C8", "B00005BHW6", "B00005QAPH", "B00009ME9Z", "B006MHZFGY", "6305081034", "B0000WN10O", "B000IHYXH6", "B0007M222A", "B006MHZ46A", "B00005JKGO", "B0007989Y8", "B002U6DVQ2", "B009D004TA", "B0009HLCTC", "B000AQKUG8", "B0002DB4YQ", "B001C0I626", "B005HK13S6", "B000305ZYS", "B000G8NXYQ", "1590177193", "8807883821", "B00AQ6J64O", "B00000IOKV", "B003ICZW8M", "B00005UQ7T", "B006LAB8RW", "B008CJ0JS4", "B000I0RNV6", "0312426844", "B00005AUKD", "B00DHN8GGW", "B004ODLUIU", "B000E3L7L4", "B00DZP1BUU", "B00005NC66", "B00B2BYXSQ", "B00005BCJZ", "B00092ZLEY", "B00007CVS3", "B008Y5OXB0", "B00AQ6J6H6", "B00128R94Y", "B00005EBSF", "B000AQKUH2", "B005VU9LP4", "B00HRJVHEK", "B0007989ZC", "B006MHZ32K", "B0006Z2NB8", "B001CW7ZSU", "B0000WN0ZK", "B00598OA2C", "6305257450", "B00AEFXG2U", "B00DHN8FXG", "B000C8Q900", "B001LMU19G", "B00065GX64", "B00005QAPJ", "B000NOK0GW", "B008Y5OWSO", "B0057GYODG", "B003VA3JTA", "B00005NFZD", "B003ICZW7I", "B0000BUZKP", "B00005V6N6", "0312597053", "B000E3L7M8", "B000BB14IA", "B00AQ6J5YA", "B0000687DE", "B00005JKFX", "B000092T5D", "B00003CXXY", "B000G8NXYG", "B005152C7S", "B0009XRZMY", "B001BEK8C4", "B00005A8TU", "B002Y26UJW", "B0026VBOJW", "B001BEK8E2", "B00192QJQC", "B00004XQN5", "B000FUF7D0", "B0001ZIVAA", "B0083V2W04", "B0000A02TX"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0375714790", "B00782O7LG", "B003VA3JTK", "B00005QAPH"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 183789}, "asin": "B00003CWQL", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4102A8XWBEL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Leopard (The Criterion Collection)"}
{"description": "As the triumphant start of a trilogy,The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ringleaves you begging for more. By necessity, Peter  Jackson's ambitious epic compresses J.R.R. Tolkien's classicThe Lord of the Rings,  but this robust adaptation maintains reverent allegiance to Tolkien's creation,  instantly qualifying as one of the greatest fantasy films ever made. At 178  minutes, it's long enough to establish the myriad inhabitants of Middle-earth,  the legendary Rings of Power, and the fellowship of hobbits, elves, dwarves, and  humans--led by the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and the brave hobbit Frodo  (Elijah Wood)--who must battle terrifying forces of evil on their perilous  journey to destroy the One Ring in the land of Mordor. Superbly paced, the film  is both epic and intimate, offering astonishing special effects and production  design while emphasizing the emotional intensity of Frodo's adventure. Ending on  a perfect note of heroic loyalty and rich anticipation, this wondrous fantasy  continues inThe Two Towers(2002).--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JKZV", "B00005JKZY", "B00BEZTMFY", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B005COPWZW", "B00005JM5E", "B002ZG980U", "B002PMV9FG", "B001GZ6QC4", "B007K3JFUQ", "B000U7WV1Y", "B00005JNJV", "B001OQCV6A", "B004M1A21K", "B008UZ7MYY", "B00HFFE8HE", "B000A9QKLO", "B000E8M0VA", "B000W7F5SS", "B0014C2FX8", "0618640150", "B001DHXT20", "B00E5I2M6I", "B00003CX5P", "B0013FDM7E", "B00AZMFJYA", "B00005QZWI", "B0019L770A", "B000I0RQVI", "B002IPFWTE", "B001CDR1FG", "B0006UEVT0", "B003TT2X6S", "B001OQCV2E", "B009JBWOU0", "B00005JL78", "B00005JNOG", "B001UV4XHY", "B00CNW9ZI6", "B00GKOJ98E", "0345325818", "B0014Z4ON4", "B000H30B2C", "B005LXQLRW", "B001UV4XIS", "B001GCUO1Q", "B00CZDLGDU", "0345538374", "B004LWZW42", "B007REV4T8", "B000W746GK", "B00005JPH2", "B003TT2X72", "B004LWZWGA", "B0087ZG7J8", "B005G4TJUC", "B003ZK99NQ", "B00006HBUJ", "B008UZA8FY", "B0090SI56Y", "B000VI70QS", "B00005JNC2", "B004WCTLNY", "B0014Z4OMU", "6305313687", "B004AKCME8", "B000E6EK2Y", "0547928211", "B000LC55F2", "B0002KVUKM", "B000FQJAIW", "B008JFUO72", "B000FIMG68", "B005LAIHSG", "B005LAIIT4", "B004AOECXI", "B00029RTCG", "B000P0J0EM", "B002HWRYJE", "B0060FXDCG", "B001ECQ75A", "0792839749", "B00AEFXZJE", "B005LAII0I", "B0042U94UQ", "B001HN6918", "B00008G8M5", "B008JFURII", "B003ZKBELG", "B000P0J09W", "B003XURDAY", "B00335EQ0E", "B00008G8M4", "0547928203", "B000W796OM", "B00006ADD5", "B00J49R1BY", "B00B04NIZO", "B00G5G7EXY", "B00001ZWUS"], "bought_together": ["B00005JKZV", "B00005JKZY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00HFFE8HE", "B00005JKZY", "B00BEZTMFY", "B00005JKZV"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 3641}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.49, "brand": "NEW Line Home Video", "asin": "B00003CWT6", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Dj%2BQ1hLBL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)"}

{"description": "Road Tripis a mostly agreeable, by-the-numbers teen flick with a  handful of inspired sequences, most of them involving MTV's resident disturbed  soul, Tom Green. It concerns a sleepy University of Ithaca student named Josh  (Breckin Meyer) who accidentally mails a video of his sexual encounter with an  infatuation (Amy Smart) to his longtime girlfriend (Rachel Blanchard), who's  seemingly avoiding him while at school in Austin, Texas. Naturally, he recruits  some buddies--Seann William Scott as the lech, D.J. Qualls as the hopeless nerd,  and Paulo Costanzo as the doper genius--to hit the open highway and intercept  the package. Even more naturally, mayhem ensues: A car explodes, a bus is  stolen, a nerd is deflowered, French toast is horribly violated, and an elderly  man bogarts both pot and Viagra.The film's humor is more democratic than politically correct, as everyone--women  and minority characters, not just the hipster white guys--have a hand in the  high jinks. Green plays Barry Manilow (no, not that one), a professional student  (eight years and counting)--he relates the film's story to skeptical prospective  students while leading them on a tour of the college--and thrill-seeking dork  extraordinaire. In particular, in an already justly famous sequence of scenes,  he sadistically anticipates and endeavors to accelerate a mouse's demise at the  jaws of a python. It's very much in the vein ofAmerican Pie, perhaps a  smidgen tamer, but at least its characters don't really learn any dopey lessons  in the end. Director and coscreenwriter Todd Phillips, who earlier made the  much-questioned documentaryFrat House, again proves he's more adept at  staging fictional comic sequences than real ones.--David Kronke", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEFXVW0", "B00AEFYS2M", "B0023TCWE8", "B000069CF0", "B0009ZE9VW", "B00005JMX6", "B00003CXS7", "B000069HQ2", "B000JJ4DNW", "B0009P42WI", "B000IZJZIU", "B003TY2SPO", "B000EMGJAO", "B000BKVQS4", "B001OD4S50", "B00AEFZ3XU", "B002CLKV54", "B00005NTOH", "B005LAIH9A", "B000031WD9", "B002Q4VBPQ", "B000CPH9PM", "B00003CY6D", "B00024JC4E", "B00260HH1W", "B006WXHJLC", "B004SIP8ES", "B00005KA6V", "B0006GANPA", "B000LC3ICE", "B00IMYVCGW", "B003VPX5Y4", "B00AEFYSL8", "B00005JMCT", "B001G5T6GW", "B00003CXE4", "B001J9KJ4I", "B0009HBPN0", "B000WZEZGI", "B00068WOH8", "B00AEBBA2C", "B00005JKMN", "B00000F0AD", "0800141687", "B001L9EXTS", "B00AEFYAMA", "B0026BXHQ0", "B004I9SJH0", "B002FU8IWU", "B0051MKNRC", "B008220BGQ", "B001C0JCBA", "B000BKJ762", "B0000A02TZ", "B004EPYZS0", "B00007AJGM", "B000E6EHE0", "630529142X", "B000RJO56O", "B001DPHDB0", "B00005JL93", "B008R65XUQ", "B0002V7TMY", "B004LWZW5G", "B000BKJ758", "6305310254", "B00005JNZU", "B004EPZ06G", "B004EPZ084", "B0041KKYGU", "0783235070", "B000ELJAEM", "B000FP2OPO", "B00003CXO1", "B004SIP9CO", "B00441GZ1E", "B00003CXPS", "B000FS9UKI", "B000F9RLL2", "B002AS466O", "B00005JMDZ", "6305428549", "B00003CY5A", "6305433925", "B0001XAQ9Q", "B000063RQO", "B00049QJBG", "B003Y5H5B0", "B00081912E", "B002ZG99H2", "B00BTYNXJG", "B0006HBZE2", "B00441GYVA", "B00005JLQE", "B00AEFY0XE", "B00KNALRZ4", "0790730979", "B008R65XNS", "B008JFUORW", "B001KKU9DW"], "bought_together": ["B00AEFXVW0", "B000JJ4DNW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AEFXVW0", "B00AEFYS2M", "B000CPH9PM", "B004GTVU6O"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 59003}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.69, "brand": "Dreamworks Skg", "asin": "B00003CXIY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5142ge7XncL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Road Trip (Unrated Edition)"}
{"description": "Schizoid serial killer Carl Stargher (Vincent D'Onofrio) has  been captured at last, but a neurological seizure has rendered him  comatose, and FBI agent Peter Novak (Vince Vaughan) has no way to  determine the location of Stargher's latest and still-living victim. To  probe the secrets contained in Stargher's traumatized psyche, the FBI  recruits psychologist Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez), who has  mastered a new technology that allows her to enter the mind of another person. What she finds in Stargher's head is a  theater of the grotesque, which, as envisioned by first-time director  Tarsem Singh, is a smorgasbord of the surreal that borrows liberally  from the Brothers Quay, Czech animator Jan Svankmajer, Hieronymous  Bosch, Salvador Dali, and a surplus of other cannibalized sources.This provides one of the wildest, weirdest visual feasts ever committed  to film, andThe Cellearns a place among such movie mind-trips  as2001: A Space Odyssey,Altered States,What Dreams  May Come, andUn Chien Andalou.

{"description": "To callPearl Harbora throwback to old-time war movies is something of an understatement. Director Michael Bay's epic take on the bombing that brought the United States into World War II hijacks every war movie situation and clich&#xE9; (some affectionate, some stale) you've ever seen and gives them a shiny, glossy spin until the whole movie practically gleams. Planes glisten, water sparkles, trees beckon--and Bay's re-creation of the bombing itself, a 30-minute sequence that's tightly choreographed and amazingly photographed, sets the action movie bar up quite a few notches. And in updating the classic war film, Bay and screenwriter Randall Wallace (Braveheart) use that old plot standby, the love triangle--this time, it's between two pilots (Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett) and a nurse (Kate Beckinsale) who find themselves stationed at Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, during what they thought would be a nice, sunny tour of duty. Then, of course, history intervened.For the first 90 minutes of the movie, Affleck and Beckinsale find a nice, appealing chemistry that plays on his strengths as a movie star and hers as a serious actress--he gives her glamour, she gives him smarts. Their truncated romance--the beginning of which is told in flashback so we can get right to the point where he has to leave her to go to England--works, thanks to their charm. They're no Kate and Leo fromTitanic(a strategy the film strives hard toward), but they're pretty darn adorable in their own right. Hartnett, as the not entirely unwelcome third wheel, squints bravely but makes only a slight dent in the film. Everyone else inPearl Harbor--from Cuba Gooding Jr.'s brave navy seaman to Jon Voight's able impersonation of FDR--is pretty much a glorified walk-on, taking a backseat to the pyrotechnics and action sequences that keep the three-hour film in fairly constant motion. But when that action does take hold,Pearl Harboris quite a thrilling ride.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792151712", "B000059HGY", "B00000K3AN", "B00AEBBA36", "0792133153", "079212569X", "6305169187", "6301734734", "0792147618", "0792116887", "6304618344", "079213690X", "6303269834", "6304925131", "6305718792", "6304259131", "B00004WIDB", "6304935811", "6303057225", "6304143184", "6302250269"], "bought_together": ["B00000K3AN", "B00AEBBA36"], "also_viewed": ["B00000G3PA", "0792151712", "6300213668", "B00000JS61", "6303215734", "6303402348", "B00004WIDB", "079213690X", "6305750750", "B004751DFU", "B00005O893", "B00000K3AN", "6301792734", "B00E5I2MCM", "6305169187", "B00007LVCM", "B007SPPANM", "B00L4K3MLE", "B00FLML7HW", "B008QZ5PY2", "B00JBGWP3Y"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 234413}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.49, "brand": "", "asin": "B00003CXTF", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HC1ZDJN6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]"}

{"description": "Five comely and well-to-do female friends receive dire threats inside anonymous valentines. When two of them meet violent ends, the remaining trio suspect that the killer may be a nebbishy former classmate whom they spurned years before at a school dance. Their solution: Throw a lavish Valentine's Day party, all the better to distract them from the hulking, cherub-masked killer...As the above suggests,Valentineis the absolute nadir of the post-Screamslasher film. Australian director Jamie Blanks (whose previous effort was the equally dismalUrban Legend, 1998) obviously had lofty goals for his film, given his bald-faced homages to John Carpenter and Dario Argento. But he hasn't a clue as to how to generate suspense, and his frequent reliance on well-worn shock effects (hands dropping on shoulders, etc.) suggests more contempt for the genre than affection. No less than four writers (including two writer-producers forRoswell, which explains the appearance of series star Katherine Heigl) contributed to the screenplay, which fails to generate the twentysomething drama and hip, cutting dialogue required for this brand of horror. As the five friends, actresses Marley Shelton, Denise Richards, Jessica Capshaw, Jessica Caufield, and Heigl have little to do other than alternately look attractive or afraid; Richards, in particular, looks weary of playing the man-eater. As Shelton's dipsomaniac boyfriend, David Boreanaz (Angel) lumbers through each scene with an embarrassed scowl.Warner Bros.' DVD includes commentary by Blanks, as well as cast and crew interviews and a video for Orgy's contribution to the noisy, new-metal soundtrack.--Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["0767824954", "B00275EHDM", "B0020PFYHC", "B00003CXLD", "B0000541TL", "B000AM4P9K", "B00005JOWW", "6305300801", "B000A5045Q", "B0002VYOVS", "B00005J761", "B002ZG99IG", "B000MM0LIM", "B000TSIJWY", "B001AV3BWM", "B000BTIU4S", "B001JFZ122", "6305017115", "B0053TWVQE", "B000F6IOAM", "B0021L8UPS", "B004LWZW2O", "B0009MWELW", "B004P7CN7W", "B001NPD9LS", "B00441GYVK", "B001QMCJ0U", "B005CFBYW6", "B002FICQFM", "B004P7CNUY", "B0002IQLH6", "B00005JMDZ", "0792840127", "B000RGN2JI", "B00005UQ9W", "B00KDU8HQQ", "B0001GF2D8", "B00003CXWM", "B00AEJM61I", "B009IV2Z3M", "B00005RYKU", "B00008LUNW", "B00G5GNYY2", "B004SUDQ1I", "B001G9CNI6", "B0000ALPFL", "B00A2H9L2E", "B000069I05", "B001MFNB8U", "B002GHHHL0", "B00003CWRF", "B00JJOY45U", "078322933X", "B000MX7V3O", "B00GHH9IIA", "B000A6T1ZY", "B000FSME9W", "B00JWXDD6O", "B0002WT4OE", "B00275EHDW", "B00006FI0R", "B00BM4Q4H6", "B000FS2W3A", "B00AJLHUA8", "B000096I9V", "B005GT3X68", "B009IV2Z7S", "B001B8XRT6", "B00006LPHA", "B000WC389G", "B00008DDVY", "B00EU8RC1S", "B000067IXO", "B000ARFPMQ", "B00HW3EJ6Y", "B005ZHBEPI", "B000A6T20S", "B000IMUYJM", "B00AZTUUQK", "B000PMLJMQ", "B000NO3DLG", "B0001ZX0GK", "B008G4T7W4", "B003M05KU0", "B0053TWV46", "B002USF1WC", "B001GCUO4S", "B0052DP1RC", "B00HRUQ7WG", "B00013RC7K", "B0013LL2YS", "B000HT38EO", "B00023P4SS", "B00001PE4D", "B002G1WPI6", "B0054602MG", "B000CCBC9O", "B000UUX2Z0", "6305238065", "B000FA57US"], "bought_together": ["0767824954"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0767824954", "B001UE7D6O", "B00275EHDM", "B005CFBYW6"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 23437}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 34.99, "brand": "RICHARDS,DENISE", "asin": "B00003CXUP", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51JFFE1942L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Valentine"}
{"description": "Employing shock techniques and sound design in a relentless sensory assault,Requiem for a Dreamis about nothing less than the systematic destruction of hope. Based on the novel by Hubert Selby Jr., and adapted by Selby and director Darren Aronofsky, this is undoubtedly one of the most effective films ever made about the experience of drug addiction (both euphoric and nightmarish), and few would deny that Aronofsky, in following his breakthrough filmPi, has pushed the medium to a disturbing extreme, thrusting conventional narrative into a panic zone of traumatized psyches and bodies pushed to the furthest boundaries of chemical tolerance. It's too easy to call this a cautionary tale; it's a guided tour through hell, with Aronofsky as our bold and ruthless host.The film focuses on a quartet of doomed souls, but it's Ellen Burstyn--in a raw and bravely triumphant performance--who most desperately embodies the downward spiral of drug abuse. As lonely widow Sara Goldfarb, she invests all of her dreams in an absurd self-help TV game show, jolting her bloodstream with diet pills and coffee while her son Harry (Jared Leto) shoots heroin with his best friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) and slumming girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly). They're careening toward madness at varying speeds, and Aronofsky tracks this gloomy process by endlessly repeating the imagery of their deadly routines. Tormented by her dietary regime, Sara even imagines a carnivorous refrigerator in one of the film's most memorable scenes. And yet... does any of this have a point?

{"description": "Perhaps the least important thing about this latest film version of Shakespeare's masterpiece is its setting in modern-day New York. Yes, such locales as the Guggenheim Museum are used wittily; answering machines and faxes are logically worked into the plot; and it was both inspired and entirely appropriate to make the prince of Denmark a moody, introspective filmmaker whose avant-garde collages provide the context for some of his famous monologues. All of which would be so much pleasantly humorous eye-candy if it didn't come hand in hand with a sympathy for and understanding of this remarkable cast of characters. For that, ultimately, is what makes Michael Almereyda'sHamletsuch a delight to watch. Forget that the immortal rumination on suicide is placed in a Blockbuster Video aisle and notice instead how Ethan Hawke's own youthful, callow arrogance makes Hamlet's vacillations believable.  And how the comical but infantilizing way Bill Murray's Polonius dotes upon his daughter Ophelia (Julia Stiles)--and her mute acceptance of his attentions--lead her to thoughts of a watery grave even before her bout of madness. And also notice how much Claudius truly does love Gertrude (when gazing at her, Kyle MacLachlan's face relaxes from its usual plasticity) and how Sam Shepard's ghost is less vengeful or tortured than stiffened by remorse. These are the shining moments of invention in Almereyda's bold updating of the play, and they are why this will be a film to watch and enjoy long after its setting has made it as much a period piece as Olivier's adaptation, with its broodingly lit castle, or Branagh's, with its gleaming 19th-century court.--Bruce Reid", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00019072G", "B00005JLCI", "B0038RSJ0U", "0780021312", "B00443FMKM", "B005COLEOA", "B000777I88", "B004M9ZI0M", "B000E6ESKS", "B0059XTUR2", "B000SIWH0U", "0792844041", "B00B6OEEKQ", "B00005U8EL", "B00CDV4JNS", "6305622876", "B00ECR7KX2", "B000QGE8IS", "B0007WRT4Q", "B00000JL7T", "B0002TVWYW", "B008H6GHE2", "B00B1E6EAY", "B001TR4G6W", "B000063JZQ", "B00AZFECHW", "B0088XQDD4", "B000K7VHLY", "B00J379KKW", "B0000714BZ", "0743288491", "B00080ZGHO", "B00005RDRT", "B00AMEZDPG", "B0051HCUMS", "1932219080", "B000HWZ4AC", "B00008US5Q", "B000260R64", "0982153317", "B0012EM5CE", "B00005S872", "B00DQN6IOK", "B008D1A18E", "B0038RSIGA", "B004H0M31I", "B003H0ZGWW", "B004SIP9U6", "B007RP4CAA", "B000QGE8JC", "B000HEWENA", "B004AV5GXG", "B007I1Q4YU", "B00063MC1Q", "B007JVSRKS", "B00H4BHIGW", "B000E6ESK8", "B002E01MBA", "079284615X", "B00006674E", "B000K2Q7H8", "1561374180", "B00019JRFY", "B00A7OBIGO", "B000ALAT64", "B000BP86VE", "B00DHHWXYY", "B00447L4KA", "B0002235QM", "B00007KQA2", "B00AGKHF1G", "0393315053", "B00IAD18FK", "B0002T2Q6U", "1411498739", "B0009PVZD2", "0780021320", "B00B2BYY1W", "B00DEYJSF2", "B007I1Q50S", "B001AQT0ZO", "B00005UJY8", "B000OY9VFW", "0316540838", "0783240325", "B001O7R75O", "B0002T2QAQ", "B00HQFA1VA", "B000QGE8J2", "1586638440", "B007I1Q4UY", "B007RP4BZ6", "B007H7OQW2", "B004P29LDG", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B0059XTUT0", "B002SF9YMU", "B00A44GNTE", "B0013D8LWC", "B003Y5H5JM"], "bought_together": ["B00019072G", "B00005JLCI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00019072G", "B0038RSJ0U", "B00005JLCI", "B00443FMKM"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 196854}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.65, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B00004Z4RP", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51NK8M7QHJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Hamlet"}
{"description": "If you've seenScreamandI Know What You Did Last Summer, then you know the entire plot ofScary Movie. That's okay, though, because this is a parody, and it helps to know the story in order to be able to get the jokes. No, the biggest surprise here is not the  story as much as the amount of full-frontal male nudity. Really, in addition to all the dick jokes (and the ass jokes and fart jokes), there's a couple of shots of the male member, one of which is erect and used as a weapon.Scary Moviesomehow ended up with an R rating, which in a sense is groundbreaking; perhaps our ratings board is loosening up after all.But is it funny? That's the most important question, and the answer to that is yes. In the vein ofAirplane!, with a dash of the Farrelly brothers,Scary Moviekeeps throwing jokes at you one after another. The law of averages says some of them have to hit, and enough of them do to keep the movie entertaining. Unlike the makers ofAirplane!, however, the Wayans brothers aren't making this movie out of a love of the genre, and unlike the Farrelly brothers, they don't make fun of retarded people with any sort of respect, so the humor throughout feels a lot uglier. Still, there are enough funny scenes inScary Movieto make the viewing experience worthwhile.

{"description": "A double bill starring Frosty:Frosty the SnowmanJimmy Durante narrates this Christmas story that is based on the song of the  same name. To make up for the fact that her students are in school on Christmas  Eve, the local schoolteacher hires the magician Professor Hinkle to entertain  the kids. Unfortunately, he's not a very good magician. Frustrated in his attempt to pull a rabbit out of his hat, he throws it away in anger. Outside, the kids build a snowman (what to call it? Harold? Oatmeal? Frosty!), and when the hat blows onto it--Happy Birthday!--it comes to life. Professor Hinkle decides he wants the hat back so he can make money off of its newfound magical properties, but the kids want to save Frosty. When the temperature starts to rise, a new problem threatens Frosty's existence. Karen, the leader of the children, comes up with a plan to save him: take him on a train to the North Pole, where it's always cold. With a cameo by Santa Claus, and the promise of Frosty's return every year, this  story of life, death, and holiday cheer is glazed with the sweet frosting of  hope and happiness. A true holiday classic.Frosty ReturnsIn the same way that many a Hollywood sequel has little to do with the first film,Frosty Returnshas almost nothing in common with the originalFrosty the Snowman, aside from a man made of snow. The biggest difference is that this Frosty doesn't need a magic hat to come to life. The story: In the town of Beansboro, old Mr. Twitchell has invented an aerosol spray that can remove snow without the hassle of shoveling or plows. This frightens Frosty, who enlists the help of amateur magician Holly and her friend Charles to stop the old coot. Made in 1992,Frosty Returnshas an animation style that looks like a cross between the old Schoolhouse Rock and Peanuts cartoons, with voice talent that includes Jonathan Winters, Andrea Martin, Jan Hooks, Brian Doyle-Murray, and John Goodman as Frosty. The story may be divisive, pitting children against adults and a pro-snow contingent against anti-snow people, but the songs are catchy and the message is one that ultimately empowers kids. Like a hero from an old Western, this Frosty is a wanderer who leaves when his job is done so he can work his magic elsewhere.--Andy Spletzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B003P3PQOO", "B000R7G6KO", "B0002M5U7E", "B002JUFPUE", "B001CO42J8", "B005AU4SBC", "B000S0PLGA", "B000GFRI7M", "B000R7G6KY", "B001CO32FS", "B003U0AHG4", "B001NPDO90", "B0002M5U6A", "B00005NB93", "B003P3PQMQ", "B00004VVP9", "B00006II5M", "B008NNY8A4", "B00005LOUP", "0307960382", "B001CW8016", "B000HT3PPG", "B008GY0POI", "B0006IIOIQ", "B000AGTPUK", "B00004TS0E", "B000VBIGCW", "B000BVM1T6", "B000S6LP5A", "B001D7T6AE", "B0057FGCJQ", "B000R7G6JK", "B002VA5A16", "B0006419KA", "B00005N7Z0", "B001DPHDBA", "6305950547", "B00008N6NQ", "B000HEWEJO", "B005QODEEE", "B003NFM3JK", "B00DZP1BOG", "B001CO32FI", "B0019KAQEU", "B00DZP1BKK", "0545450055", "B002MU4NN6", "B001CO42IO", "B000VBIGD6", "B005BYBZPY", "B002VA5A0M", "B0052OPJ1E", "B000068TR1", "0824956567", "B002K2KMMW", "B005MQXZGI", "0375875115", "B003X3BYG0", "B000YABV7W", "B003YCIE68", "B00DGWZK0Y", "B000OLGCIE", "0824919106", "B002HQZX8Y", "B002WZUNX0", "B000HC2LH6", "B0009OUAZW", "B000TJBN6W", "B00275EHJG", "B003Z8ZCFW", "B00DS79H9C", "6301752627", "B0000694ZS", "B00005MEPA", "B001DJLD1W", "B0010KP374", "B0010DM4EG", "1623540127", "B00G5G7EXY", "B006942FGS", "B00008X5J7", "B007FC393G", "B00F522C7C", "B0000AI42B", "B00005K9OF", "B001U7NVXA", "B00DZP1BJ6", "B0002F6BRE", "B00GDT5T9Y", "B00CNW9ZI6", "B005BXY1R4", "B003H9M1Q2", "0395389496", "B008UY8FI2", "B00006JZI2", "B000002QUV", "B00G5G7K7O", "B0030IIYYS", "B0007A0F4E", "B00EEBNCI8"], "bought_together": ["B003P3PQOO", "B002JUFPUE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003P3PQMQ", "B0057FGCJQ", "B003P3PQOO", "B002JUFPUE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 314489}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 24.95, "brand": "Sony Pictures Home Entertainment", "asin": "B000051XIW", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51VYMT32SWL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Frosty the Snowman/Frosty Returns"}
{"description": "John Waters spoofs independent filmmaking at its most absurd fringe  with this affectionate portrait of a guerrilla filmmaking collective that  declares war on Hollywood drivel. Bitchy screen queen Honey Whitlock  (Melanie Griffith, whose kewpie doll voice and aging baby face are right at home) is kidnapped by would-be auteur Cecil (Stephen Dorff), a slogan-spouting bottle blonde with a cult-like crew of cinema outlaws called \"The Sprocket Holes.\" Cecil has declared war on Hollywood with the  ultimate underground movie, \"Raving Beauty,\" and his reluctant star Honey soon  adopts her young misfit captors like a worried Mommy as her cultural cachet  rises: the falling star has turned into a cult cinema rebel. It's a bizarre revision of the Patty Hearst story (with Hearst herself in a supporting  role) full of film insider jokes and '60s revolutionary references, but  it's more spoof than satire. Waters's primitive style is often clumsy, and  the picture moves in fits and starts, but the cast's enthusiasm brings it  to life. Waters has always celebrated misfits, outcasts, and cultural  rebels and their self-made families, and this is his most outrageous,  anarchic such bunch in decades. Through all the shootouts, bomb throwing,  and fights with angry teamsters and suburban moms, there's an odd sense of  innocence to the enterprise. It's as if Waters wants to remind us: it's  only a movie.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000929UOQ", "0780625528", "B0013527L6", "B00005LQ0T", "B0002RQ3M0", "B0002RQ3LQ", "B0009IOR6Q", "B00006RZ9Y", "B00HZ67OOW", "B000TGJ89O", "B000929UPA", "B00005NC4Y", "B005SW2RK6", "0743246276", "1560256982", "B000092T3A", "B00005B6OZ", "0374532869", "B000UYX4QI", "B0002RQ3LG", "0374298637", "B001FOK70S", "B00D3O5ZAK", "B004GSVX7Q", "B00GGT4OK6", "B001152TL6", "B00005JKJA", "B000H5TH1Q", "B000QUEQ4K", "B00JVLGKXU", "1934429023", "6303223052", "0500284350", "B001P3SA8K", "078322933X", "1560257024", "B00000IC7G", "B005FQ2H9Q", "B001B187L6", "B008CYDD7I", "B001O2UTQS", "B0053TWVQ4", "B000063JDE", "B00ESZZOMM", "B008DVJOQ4", "161703181X", "0767827740", "B004KDYR20", "B00005N89S", "B007C95S9K", "B000NA278K", "B005FQ2HEQ", "B00A429Y56", "B00009MEB8", "B00DOZNGTK", "B00441GYVK", "0783228457", "B00005QW5X", "B004SIP6VI", "B000JU7JIW", "B000092Q5O", "B00000JSJC", "B000001I09", "B000059HA5", "B0000542CB", "B000025IIH", "1937112101", "B00005QCVX", "B00134SU2C", "B00005AUJU", "B00005U14H", "B00DTPRZ24", "B000053VAV", "6305268800", "B0000YTOL2", "B00005T30L", "B000092T3X", "B00EOBB7LC", "B000OU082G", "B00004KDES", "B0012RWQJ8", "B000S0GYRU", "B003KGBIRK", "B008NNY8XQ", "B0000687DF", "B00028HBJI", "0500251959", "B001JIE7JC", "B00GHH9IIA", "B001VG2MAI", "B0000VD04M", "0783229526", "B006KH6CF4", "B00AB2NWY8", "B008MU8ZNO", "1419705547", "6305428425", "B0007UC8Y4", "B00005JMX6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00006RZ9Y", "B0002RQ3LQ", "B000929UOQ", "B0002RQ3M0"]}, "price": 9.86, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 202976}, "asin": "B000053V7C", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51B52V9S5JL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Cecil B Demented"}
{"description": "When Maggie (Kim Basinger ofL.A. ConfidentialandBatman) comes home to her apartment building one night, she discovers her estranged, drug-addict sister Jenna huddling in the doorway. Jenna promptly abandons her newborn baby with Maggie, who proceeds to raise the child as her own, despite evidence of autism. But as the little girl, Cody, gets older, what seemed to be autism starts to manifest itself in more startling ways. At the same time, a series of child murders are sweeping the city--murders conducted by a mysterious cult with supernatural matters on their mind.Bless the Childstarts promisingly, with subdued, creepy scenes contrasted with more outrageous moments like swarms of computer-generated rats. Fans of religious horror movies will enjoy its twist onThe Omen, with an angelic child instead of a demonic one--only the child is still pretty eerie. The special effects go a little overboard towards the end. Jimmy Smits (Price of Glory) costars as an FBI cult chaser, and Rufus Sewell (Dark City,Cold Comfort Farm) gives a pleasantly restrained performance as the charismatic cult leader. Also  featuring Christina Ricci as a cult escapee and Ian Holm as a Jesuit priest.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305718954", "B000056PNK", "0767817737", "B00005JH9M", "B00AEBBA2W", "6305213305", "B0002DB54A", "B00008LUNW", "B001B7CNXS", "B0000AOX0A", "B0021L8UFI", "B004EPYZO4", "B0002C4JJ4", "B0009MDPYM", "B000HC2M0C", "B00013RC66", "B00005N5RM", "6305308837", "B0021L8UPS", "B003VA3JUO", "B00004RF85", "B00GNAO70K", "B001JNNDJM", "B00013RC7K", "B00005UQ9W", "B00AEFYXQI", "B000KGGIZA", "B00007AJE1", "B00005UQ9I", "B002ZG98N2", "B0021L8UYY", "B00008979G", "B00J49R1BY", "B005JJCMOO", "B004XVMCN0", "B00005JKQS", "B009XTF8KQ", "B000063US5", "0800177789", "B00005O5AZ", "B000BTJDGC", "B002GHHHL0", "B000A6T20I", "B0045HCIWW", "B00005RYKU", "078322933X", "B00BEIYG98", "B003IY498Y", "B001QMCJ14", "B004SUDQ1I", "B0009X763M", "B000056PMU", "B0021L8V34", "B00000ILDG", "B000UNYK4E", "B00009WVSL", "B0001FVDQ4", "B000MMMTBY", "B00AEFXW8I", "B00803PG44", "B000A6T20S", "B00004TS0G", "B00005JNY3", "B00AP2DC94", "B00004W4UB", "B00064X5L6", "B0051GLDQS", "B00005JL3K", "B00029RT9E", "B0001ZX0GU", "0783230451", "B00009OWI1", "B00AIBZKV0", "B00005JKZH", "B00AEFXEGS", "0767812182", "B000PMLJMQ", "6305767866", "6305428115", "B00AEFYYH6", "B00HW3EZXQ", "B0045HCJT4", "0767815718", "B002XTXG8O", "6305065551", "0792159659", "B002AT8KAG", "B001B1UO6W", "B0047T74CM", "0780624890", "B00AEFYGBA", "B00EL6ADQ0", "B00174RCHW", "B000EHQU0S", "B0006D3HGA", "630471193X", "B00005O439", "B002UXRH10", "B000U1ZV76"], "bought_together": ["6305718954", "0767817737"], "buy_after_viewing": ["6305718954", "B000056PNK", "0767817737", "B000HC2M0C"]}, "price": 9.98, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 78910}, "asin": "B0000541W8", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41HT9E2MGJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Bless the Child"}
{"description": "With so many romantic comedies revolving around eternally adolescent men with self-centered philosophies and terminal commitment problems, it's kind of nice to see one of them take stock of himself. Tim Daly, a chef with unconventional methods (try his dishwasher fish), embarks on a quest through past loves with sincere questions about why things didn't work out. Boyish Daly is charming as the rogue romantic, and his tour through broken affairs gives some fine actresses comic-showcase scenes--Jamie Gertz, Laura Leighton, Elizabeth Pe&ntilde;a, Mimi Rogers, and Katy Selverstone among them. Olivia d'Abo is his current flame, a would-be psychic restaurateur who sets out after him, and Melora Hardin is an old gal pal who just may be his best chance at a fresh start. This isn't quite theHigh Fidelitything--Daly's quest is a well-meaning attempt at personal growth, not a sour tour of self-justification--but then this is hardly as ambitious or revealing. He doesn't learn anything that a little serious self-examination would reveal just as well, but that's beside the point. It's a warm and winning little comedy about growing up, letting go, and opening up, with deftly played comedy and generous performances.--Sean Axmaker", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 205308}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "title": "Seven Girlfriends", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0009I7NGM", "B00AEBB9UK", "B00005MM6A", "B0000C2IR4", "B002OQZE5E", "B001KZVQKC", "B0000UHCME", "6302958822", "6300128490", "6302236266", "6303926177", "B000B6H1YG", "B000228EHM", "630310665X", "B0009PW3RY", "6305181136"]}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51BZ9957J8L._SY300_.jpg", "asin": "B000055WFX"}
{"description": "Call them \"Grumpy Old Goodfellas,\" old mobsters who trade in their rods for a retirement home. Fast-talking Richard Dreyfuss is the nominal leader of the quartet of retired Jersey wiseguys, and thick-headed softy Dan Hedaya, silver-haired lady's man Seymour Cassel, and Burt Reynolds, an enforcer with a pacemaker, round out the group. When their Florida apartment house threatens to go condo with young, upscale tenants, they flex their creaky muscles and scare off investors with a devious bit of mob theatrics. Their success spirals out of control, and soon they're up to their toupees in blackmail, murder for hire, a homicide investigation by a cop who just may be Dreyfuss's character's long-lost daughter (Carrie-Anne Moss), and a mob war with a Hispanic drug lord. Jennifer Tilly costars as a scheming stripper, and Lainie Kazan is terrific as a brassy widow.The script, byKingpincowriter Barry Fanaro, flirts with leering sexual humor and outrageous gags while turning unrepentant killers into a cute and cuddly bunch of snappy-dressing codgers. Leave it to director Michael Dinner to transform that into a warm, sweet, good-natured film that explores the way the aged lose dignity in their later years and celebrates the strength of four guys who draw on their skills, their courage, and their spirit to take their dignity back.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000633R5", "B003AWRM9W", "B00006ADFN", "B000065V3E", "B00023P4QK", "B00G7QPUII", "B00IMRL4BC", "B00J5G1P2W", "B0003JAO7C", "B00FRILRL6", "0790731460", "6305268797", "B008JFURII", "B00IT3KP96", "B00003CWUX", "B000065U1D", "B000HT38CQ", "B003Q6D2B4", "B001Q8MMC4", "B008XAT0U0", "B000U1ZV8U", "B00BLF9FOK", "B00DL48BM6", "B00005T7HW", "B00AEFYRJQ", "B00G7QPST4", "B00AIBZMD6", "B00004ZBVG", "B0034GK78W", "B00AEFY5GQ", "B00121QGV8", "B0087DFIYA", "B0000542CG", "B000065V3I", "B0071HPOHY", "B00005N89R", "B000RETOGU", "B0001GNJRE", "0790742071", "B00JA3RPAG", "B008JFUNKU", "B00803PGGM", "B00AEFY7NM", "B000BF0C8E", "B00005V5NS", "B000MGBSE4", "B00008MTW6", "B000EQ5SRK", "B00005PJ6O", "B0007QJ1ZW", "B00DX88J9A", "B000O77LYM", "B00BTYFWEK", "B0000C0FFV", "B000055Y0Y", "B000QFCD7W", "B0003JAOPO", "B002GOAGYI", "B00003CXWM", "B003AWRMBU", "0767821513", "B0006HBZBK", "B000SK5Z70", "6305428034", "B003ASLJIQ", "B00HEPE6MM", "B00005LOL0", "B003AWRMA6", "B00066FB8Y", "B002GHHHP6", "B00BTYRB58", "B000XKW2WG", "B000056PMU", "B000LXGXY8", "B00003CXNG", "B00803PG3A", "078322740X", "B00096S4DK", "B000035P5V", "6305213283", "B000E8QVBU", "B00005JA9F", "B00AEBB9YQ", "B000065V3P", "B000N2HD6O", "B000063JDO", "B000J40AK2", "B00007KK50", "B000BGR1B4", "B00096S4B2", "B00013WVKI", "B0045HCIYA", "B00009AOAZ", "0767817761", "B00BUAEYVK", "B00005B1YH", "B00005YU1M", "B00JG88XD8", "B00004Z1FX", "B000089796"], "bought_together": ["B003Q6D2B4", "B008JFURII"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00803PG3A", "B008XAT1KO", "B0048NVT0A", "B002FUIJ5Q"]}, "price": 9.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 80883}, "asin": "B000056VOZ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41PS8TTBERL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Crew"}

There's nearly an hour of behind-the-footage material, all of it superior made-for-cable featurettes so often included on DVDs. The technicians divulge little tricks of the trade, revealing more computer effects in the film than you'd think. Longtime Eastwood editor Joel Cox provides insight into the director's work routine. The highlight, though, is an extended version of the four principles' appearance onThe Tonight Show, with Jay Leno providing some interesting comments on how he chooses what films will \"appear\" on his show.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B003ASLJOU", "B00388PK7O", "B003ASLJJU", "B000N3SSBW", "B003AWRMA6", "0790731460", "0783225733", "B003AWRM9W", "B00AEFXVOI", "B003AWRMC4", "B001M9ELQ2", "B003ASLJNQ", "B002GHHHP6", "B003ASLJKE", "B003ASLJO0", "B003ASLJRC", "B003ASLJS6", "B004GJYRI2", "B00DDT0JB0", "B000055Y0Y", "B0015XHQT4", "B0002V7OI8", "B003AWRMCE", "B003ASLJIQ", "B003ASLJPE", "B003ASLJMW", "B00000G3PA", "B003AWRMBU", "B00005JPLE", "B003ASLJQI", "B00E8G5HQE", "B0045HCJ0S", "B003AWRMCY", "B000JYW5BE", "B00008CMT4", "0783225547", "B0001FVDJQ", "6304711891", "6305213283", "0792838408", "B000U1ZV8K", "B00368PSKK", "B003AWRM9M", "B0015NORDW", "B0003JAOCC", "B007XTDWKQ", "6304765258", "B00KLEYXZS", "B00008G7QH", "6304698801", "B002M9WW3A", "B00003CWU3", "B003Q6D2B4", "B000U1ZV62", "B00AEFYUQQ", "B003ASLJK4", "B00096S4DK", "0767803434", "B002GIBVVG", "B002NZK5R8", "B003AT9D74", "B0045HCJFS", "B002N57KG2", "B002Z7FWBI", "B00AEFYTEY", "B000PHVZNE", "B000EQHXOG", "6305236569", "B00008G8M4", "B00003CXHJ", "0780622650", "B00005JA9F", "B00006SFKE", "B0000TANUI", "B00004YA66", "B00026ZG10", "B0000YTP02", "B00AEBB9WI", "B002OGMGV4", "B000KGGIV4", "B0006FYOTC", "B000YAF4MA", "B00AEFXPSK", "0783230346", "B001NFNFIK", "B00936A1ZG", "B00015YVDG", "B002GHHHKQ", "B000W1SZBS", "B000JJSJPK", "B001B3LIOC", "B00008OE4W", "0767827813", "B000P0J0EM", "B00ALTQRRK", "B00AEFXRG0", "B00BTYNXL4", "B00000IQC4", "B00DHD933W", "B000FO0A9W"], "bought_together": ["B003ASLJOU"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00DDT0JB0", "B003ASLJRC", "B000N3SSBW", "B00388PK7O"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 22001}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.89, "brand": "Warner", "asin": "B00005ALS2", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51wRmrOwiQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Space Cowboys"}

{"description": "Antoine Fuqua (THE REPLACEMENT KILLERS, BAIT) turns up the intensity level with TRAINING DAY, a charged drama about police corruption in downtown Los Angeles. Ethan Hawke stars as Jake Hoyt, a well-intentioned young officer who thinks he's found his ticket to becoming a detective in the form of undercover officer Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington). Harris is a notorious figure in the streets and in the office. He also has the authority to make Jake's professional wishes come true, provided Jake is able to prove his worth on Alonzo's team. At first, Alonzo's blunt, carefree demeanor provides a shock to Jake's optimistic system, but as it becomes clear that Alonzo is dangerously out of control, Jake must decide whether or not to risk his future in the name of the law.\n\nWashington's performance as the evil, pragmatic detective is a sight to behold. He delivers his lines with a devilish ferocity that keeps the film bubbling throughout. Hawke slips into the role of the rookie everyman with ease, providing a good contrast to Washington's fiery presence. Former video director Fuqua completes the picture by casting musicians Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre, and Macy Gray in supporting roles.", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792841778", "630268644X", "6303012140", "6300214826"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 428216}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.0, "brand": "", "asin": "B00005JKEC", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/415AYTB1GNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Training Day [VHS]"}

{"description": "Gosford Parkfinds director Robert Altman in sumptuously fine form indeed. From the opening shots, as the camera peers through the trees at an opulent English country estate, Altman exploits the 1930s period setting and whodunit formula of the film expertly. Aristocrats gather together for a weekend shooting party with their dutiful servants in tow, and the upstairs/downstairs division of the classes is perfectly tailored to Altman's method (as employed inNashvilleandShort Cuts) of overlapping bits of dialogue and numerous subplots in order to betray underlying motives and the sins that propel them. Greed, vengeance, snobbery, and lust stir comic unrest as the near dizzying effect of brisk script turns is allayed by perhaps Altman's strongest ensemble to date. First and foremost, Maggie Smith is marvelous as Constance, a dependent countess with a quip for every occasion; Michael Gambon, as the ill-fated host, Sir William McCordle, is one of the most palpably salacious characters ever on screen; Kristin Scott Thomas is perfectly cold yet sexy as Lady Sylvia, Sir William's wife; and Helen Mirren, Emily Watson, and Clive Owen are equally memorable as key characters from the bustling servants' quarters below.Gosford Parkmanages to be fabulously entertaining while exposing human shortcomings, compromises, and our endless need for confession.--Fionn Meade", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000BITVAG", "B007A2O3FO", "B00003CXC9", "B005S9EJ14", "B0000CE684", "B00AZMFO6I", "B0080QOL10", "630560097X", "B000LPS34E", "B000E8JNQU", "B004ALIG2O", "B00005UNCB", "B004JMSIQS", "6305692696", "B00F1BFRA6", "B002TZS58I", "B0002DRDY6", "B004SIP7D0", "B000E0ODZE", "B0001US78G", "B004XVMCMQ", "B004XYOQU4", "1557045313", "B005SYZYYK", "B000F3UAFC", "B000063K2Q", "B00003CX8N", "B0009GX1CE", "B001KP2J3U", "B0006Z2NAY", "B008NNY8TK", "B00062IZ0Y", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B005CFBZX4", "B004U7MQZ6", "B0001I55M4", "B00005O7N8", "0788815490", "B00GSBMNOQ", "B003UESJH4", "B0001DCYUU", "B0000797E7", "B008RO6PJQ", "B0013K2ZGI", "B000ETRCN0", "B00005OBAL", "B0009PVZM8", "6305918880", "B0080QOKYS", "B00HUAH14Q", "B00009IB1D", "B000A8AXXG", "B00GWXI16O", "B00C888OFA", "B00GAXASLC", "1250020360", "B000N4SHOE", "B004H0ZHD4", "B0099Y2MYK", "B009B1EPQ4", "B001CW7ZT4", "1573629723", "B009T6CXG0", "B001GJ4U5A", "B004SIP98S", "B00G15MDI0", "B00B62R9XM", "B004SIP9U6", "B0080QOL1A", "B000069HZU", "B004N66XYE", "B004XVMCKS", "1250047900", "B004499LWG", "B00AY2DL78", "6305428557", "B00A1EOC22", "B00D49YEHO", "B00BTYJYR6", "B0001US61O", "B0006Q9482", "B007701RFS", "B0073U2EWM", "B00F98FOI6", "B000092T3P", "B000CCW2O8", "B000065V3V", "B004HHX9H8", "B00HYZ0ZLS", "B00JFH8GZA", "B003DUBAXK", "B00AEFYO5I", "B00005U2KC", "B004SIP7F8", "B00GAHJO8G", "B00005RDRO", "B00DW5IKWK", "B00D3PYQT0", "B00005JOA0"], "bought_together": ["B000BITVAG", "B005S9EJ14"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AZMFO6I", "B000BITVAG", "630560097X", "B00005UNCB"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 7477}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 10.27, "brand": "Universal Studios", "asin": "B00005JKNF", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51oleUlbquL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Gosford Park - Collector's Edition"}

{"description": "Delicate and hypnotic,The Hoursinterweaves three stories with remarkable skill: in the 1920s Virginia Woolf (Nicole Kidman) grapples  with her inner demons and slowly works on her novelMrs. Dalloway;  in 1949 housewife Laura Brown (Julianne Moore) feels her own destructive impulses; and in 1999 book editor Clarissa Vaughn (Meryl  Streep)--much like the title character of Woolf's novel--prepares to throw a party, in honor of her dearest friend, a seriously ill  poet (Ed Harris). Small details reverberate from story to story  as a powerhouse cast (including Allison Janney, Toni Collette, Claire  Danes, Jeff Daniels, John C. Reilly, Stephen Dillane, and Miranda Richardson) gives subtle  and beautifully modulated performances. In the hands of director Stephen  Daldry (Billy Elliot),The Hoursis almost more a piece of  music than a story, and like music, it may move you in unexpected ways.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0001US7Q8", "B0030BOCFU", "0312243022", "B00005JLQH", "0784011710", "B004SIP71M", "B00007BH3Y", "B00008L3UM", "B00005JLRE", "6305268827", "B00JV054FQ", "B00005LOKU", "B000059XTI", "B003L20ICE", "B000CS45TW", "0783230583", "B000V6LSOA", "B000XJD3JI", "B00005MEOU", "B00H7LJ2UO", "B0016Q2D66", "B000E33VWW", "B005JZBOV0", "B005CFBZ3O", "0156628708", "B0045O2PHS", "B00002E22E", "B00G7QPXUI", "B001EJW0SG", "B00AEFYSWM", "B00B27WTOK", "B0073U2EWM", "B0007P0X9G", "B000FVQLQQ", "B009B1EPQ4", "B0002B15ZG", "B0000640VK", "B00AEFZ63M", "B0045HCJ94", "0767847415", "B0013FCWUW", "B000H6SXYM", "B00005JMJD", "0374172897", "B00008RV0G", "B0001I2BUI", "B0007ZEOPK", "B0059XTUVI", "0783240171", "B004FQX5B6", "0767811100", "B00GUO2SKA", "B001RTCP24", "B00GSBMNOQ", "B000J103OI", "B004LB5FCW", "B0029Z8K74", "B000068MBW", "B00005JMJG", "B004SIP7F8", "0547447345", "B00AEBB8SS", "0786888075", "6304696515", "B003Q7B78S", "B0014GI6I2", "B00AQBDU4Q", "B0064MT1FI", "B00003CWQR", "B004AE3QYE", "B0006210ZG", "B000RF7XYO", "B00003CXZ4", "B0030BOCMS", "B004499LWG", "B00102F5WK", "B004XVMCKS", "B00005JLSK", "B0038N9WKU", "B0000542C5", "B0007P0YKY", "B000228EGS", "B00BJC8OJ2", "B001E95ZNS", "B00005JMJ4", "B002ZG99EK", "B00G15MDI0", "B002RSDW80", "B003VZNAU8", "B001QUF3SW", "B000CS464G", "B00FZ4KR4U", "B0041KKYEM", "B00007AJF8", "B004SIP7D0", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00H9HZITU", "015670160X", "B00009W5CA"], "bought_together": ["B0001US7Q8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000XJD3JI", "B0030BOCFU", "0784011710", "B005ELEN26"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 108694}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 13.96, "brand": "Paramount Home Video", "asin": "B00005JKTI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5187J2EA4HL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Hours"}

{"description": "A Beautiful Mindmanages to twist enough pathos out of John Nash's incredible life story to redeem an at-times goofy portrayal of schizophrenia. Russell Crowe tackles the role with characteristic fervor, playing the Nobel prize-winning mathematician from his days at Princeton, where he developed a groundbreaking economic theory, to his meteoric rise to the cover ofForbesmagazine and an MIT professorship, and on through to his eventual dismissal due to schizophrenic delusions. Of course, it is the delusions that fascinate director Ron Howard and, predictably, go astray. Nash's other world, populated as it is by a maniacal Department of Defense agent (Ed Harris), an imagined college roommate who seems straight out ofDead Poets Society, and an orphaned girl, is so fluid and scriptlike as to make the viewer wonder if schizophrenia is really as slick as depicted. Crowe's physical intensity drags us along as he works admirably to carry the film on his considerable shoulders. No doubt the story of Nash's amazing will to recover his life without the aid of medication is a worthy one, his eventual triumph heartening. Unfortunately, Howard's flashy style is unable to convey much of it.--Fionn Meade", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004SIP7ZS", "B0043X1FL8", "B004FQX5B6", "B00AEFZ63M", "B0000YEEGM", "B00003CWQR", "B000ARTN3I", "B000EHQU0S", "6305144168", "0767811100", "B000066HAS", "B000P0J0EW", "B00AEFYSWM", "B0002B15ZG", "1451628420", "B00000IQV7", "B000021Y7L", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00AEFY5B6", "B003ASLJQI", "B000XJD3JI", "B004SUDQ22", "B004U7MR1Y", "B00A81MV3U", "B0043X1FM2", "B00B0U2SFE", "B002NZK5UK", "B000N6U0E2", "B003B3NGS6", "B00AEBB9F0", "B00AEBB8NI", "B00004RJ73", "B00003CWRX", "B00125WAWS", "B00005JLSB", "6305428352", "B00008EY60", "0800141806", "B00001ZWUS", "B00011CZRE", "B00AEBB9CS", "6304712936", "0780619587", "B00007GZR5", "B000YAF4MA", "B000KX0IOA", "B004SIP8W0", "B00080ZG10", "B00B9LNPA6", "0783225733", "B003U0AHBO", "B00004BZIY", "B00005JND5", "B000E33VWW", "B003NF97NK", "B0038M2AZA", "B002CPMB9O", "B000P0J0EM", "B000A3XY5A", "B00AFEXRME", "B00005Q4CS", "B000LC55F2", "B00AEBB9SM", "B0006FYOTC", "B000056VP4", "B002WNU0QW", "B000RTB0R6", "0684819066", "B00003CXZ4", "B00AEFY17E", "B000EGDB10", "B002VECM6S", "B002ZG980U", "B001P9KR8U", "B001N44BVQ", "B000LP6KNU", "B0007DFJ0G", "B0002V7ON8", "B0018CWW5K", "B00JPQ1INI", "B0030Y12FU", "B003ELKNH2", "B000K2UGZM", "B00121QGPY", "B0001CNRAM", "B00003CXFV", "0783223609", "B007N31YH0", "B002HK9IDQ", "B005BYBZEK", "B000JJ5F8O", "B00AEFYXJ0", "B003UESJHO", "B00A7MSQSO", "B004SIP9U6", "B00005JL78", "B00012QLB4", "B003UESJH4", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B000K7VHQE"], "bought_together": ["B004SIP7ZS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00C7MW5EI", "B004SIP7ZS", "B001F34HRS", "B00001ZWUS"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 3605}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.99, "brand": "UNI DIST CORP.

{"description": "It's not that the folks at Pixar are geniuses when it comes to DVDs... well, come to think of it, their fifth DVD set shows these folks are wizards. It's not just that the two discs are packed with watchable extras that hardly reiterate the same information; it's how they are handled--funny, inventive, with a light touch--unlike many PR-driven discs. A good place to start is the filmmakers' jolly commentary track, which branches off into 31 minutes of behind-the-scene stuff, deleted scenes, and curious anecdotes (they can also be watched separately). Pixar's first making-of documentary is a most concise and interesting 25-minute examination that also sheds light on how the company works. With a digital-to-digital transfer, the film looks great and is available in widescreen or reformatted to full screen. The \"Family Fun\" disc includes another Pixar made-for-the-DVD gem, the 7-minute \"Exploring the Reef\" with Jean-Michel Cousteau (Jacques's son) being upstaged by Dori and Marlin; it's a hoot and teaches a fact or two you will remember about reefs. Both discs feature lovely menus that can be turned into virtual aquariums for your TV (by removing the text) featuring the knockout colors of the film's settings. Watch long enough for some shenanigans from the film's characters and vocal talent. Genius, pure genius.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00EV1YZ96", "B00AFEX83C", "B00007LVCM", "B00005JNS0", "B0030IIZ4M", "B00GDT5T9Y", "B003ZHVJGO", "B00G5G7EXY", "B00003CXB4", "B001KVZ6FW", "B0013FSL3E", "B004HO6I4M", "B00005JN4W", "B000MV9026", "B004G600A4", "B000AY74OG", "B000VBJEEG", "B0006UEVT0", "B008YWY0HK", "B003H9M1Q2", "B00CQRN3QI", "B0001I561E", "B0042U94UQ", "B00E9ZATJO", "B000YERP2S", "B0006JMLRK", "B000AAF1TU", "B0000AOX0O", "B00CTNYLQA", "B00F522C7C", "B0039N74CW", "B00003CXCQ", "B001ILFUDC", "B00275EHJG", "B001HN6922", "0736429220", "B000B8QG4A", "B000RMJ4F8", "B0084IHVN4", "B002ZG97YM", "B001ECQ75A", "B004ZBACOE", "B0030IIYYS", "B0084IHVGG", "B00E9ZATKI", "B00AO686JC", "B000GUJZ00", "B00004R99S", "B0012EM5D8", "B0084IHVUC", "B0013ND30M", "B0034JKZ86", "B0000VV4W2", "B00003CX8Y", "B008JFUQ16", "B001DPHDCY", "B00005TN8K", "B00CUDD0C0", "B00A83075M", "B001O5LVPI", "B001NCDFTW", "B00G7TIKMI", "B0000E32WJ", "B00CWM58WY", "B001ILFUD2", "B00009YXAW", "B00CMY3JBO", "B00335EQ0E", "B005LAIISA", "0783231474", "B0002YLCOM", "B00E00OGE2", "B000H7JCK0", "B000UVKGPI", "B00005JMQZ", "B00JK531ES", "B00004U9WQ", "B005LAIH4A", "B005LAIHW2", "B00024I2Z4", "B00I6JOD2S", "B008NNY9QW", "B0000VCZKM", "B00FE8BVF6", "6302526574", "B004EPZ034", "B000L22SG6", "B001OMU6UM", "B00E56D8FO", "B0000524D0", "B002WJI2QQ", "B0009CTT6U", "B000050MN3", "B000B8QG3G", "B0058AFS0O", "B00006FDAI", "B00EGIAQ1K", "B000A7G4TY"], "bought_together": ["B00EV1YZ96", "B00G5G7EXY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00EV1YZ96", "B00AFEX83C", "B00I6JOD2S", "B004HO6I4M"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 7746}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 25.5, "brand": "Disney", "asin": "B00005JM02", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51-difUGanL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)"}
{"description": "There's only one deleted scene in this two-disc DVD set, but it's a doozy. The \"Sgt. Candy Scene\" is a must-see and, unfortunately, the best thing on the second disc. The rushed HBO documentary shows us far more flash than substance. Better is the Visual Effects Lab that goes more in-depth with four sequences, although you need to wade through a hokey interface for each segment. Making your \"own\" effects isn't that much fun; you can only choose a few effects that change in two scenes. Anyone looking to get the complicated backstory of the trilogy figured out should dig into the \"Sky Net Database\" and an intricate timeline. The two commentary tracks are worth a listen, with director Jonathan Mostow's solo track the better one. The director goes into great detail on how the little things (from lighting street scenes to tricks for destroying buildings) count.

{"description": "More sex. More violence. That's what you get in the unrated director's cut ofTaking Lives, which ought to tell you where director D.J. Caruso's priorities lie. The hot scenes between Angelina Jolie and Ethan Hawke are extended (offering a bit more nudity for Jolie's lecherous fans), and the fate of Gena Rowlands's character isconsiderablymore graphic, but none of the added footage makes the movie any better or worse. That said, this cynical director's cut is the only version worth buying if you're looking to fill out your serial-killer-thriller collection (or your movies-in-which-Jolie-gets-naked collection), and you might as well enjoy the gag reel outtakes because they contain the only footage on the entire DVD in which Jolie cracks a genuine smile. The four featurettes are really just one standard-issue promo reel chopped into thematic categories with a pretentiousCSIvibe, and while they offer little of substance, seasoned film buffs will welcome the appearance of veteran British editor Anne V. Coates, who briefly explains her approach to cutting high-tension scenes. The rest is routine at best, but given the choice between the full-screen DVD and this steamier, more gruesome widescreen version, well, it's no contest. Jolie and her breasts await you.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783240295", "B00005V4XV", "B0002KPIQY", "B00006G8JD", "B001GKJ2E8", "B0021L8V0M", "B000G2YCVA", "B001NFNFNU", "B000VBB6F6", "B00BTYU3W6", "B00029RT9E", "B00003CXZ1", "B002NZK5RI", "B004A8ZWSS", "B0050UEVNM", "B00003CWQR", "B000AP04FG", "B002O3Z4ZW", "B00AEFYGBA", "6305821216", "B000MXPE7O", "B00AEFYF2K", "B00011CZRE", "B0000ZG072", "B00096S49Y", "B00007AJE1", "B000PMFS2I", "0792159659", "B001HVZOB6", "B00004Z4WR", "B00AEFXT1S", "B00AEFXEGS", "B000MX7V70", "B000GRUMSC", "B00008L3S6", "B00151QYXU", "B0045HCIYA", "B000FS9UKI", "B006OB3JVQ", "B00005JN0T", "B0010YVCB6", "B00005JLZN", "6305308837", "B00003CY0V", "B00AEBBA2W", "B0034G4OSG", "B002NZK5VO", "B000E5N684", "B00015YVDG", "B0001GF2D8", "B0000541TM", "B0006IIPIK", "0790730979", "B00K2CHX9C", "B002QW7AMG", "B00AP2DC94", "B00023P4I8", "B001CC7PLM", "0767810872", "B00E8G5HXM", "B003LR5BD0", "B0062P3392", "B00BB67UNW", "B00BNH9NCU", "B0007W7I4W", "B0010HOZW6", "B003L20IG0", "0783229402", "B004XQO90O", "B00006RCNY", "B00006HAWN", "B00024JC30", "B000TGJ8CQ", "B0000V492Y", "B00174RCHW", "B0040J1RX6", "B0002IQLHQ", "B002AT8KAG", "B00005JN2Z", "B001N44BVQ", "B0047T74CM", "B00BEIYIF0", "B004A8ZX28", "B000U1ZV76", "B000G5SILC", "B000R4SMCW", "0767807588", "B00009WVSL", "B002DU39GW", "6301971345", "B004SIP7VM", "B000BVM1S2", "0767802519", "B00887490Y", "B004VJJG92", "B0067EKYAY", "B000BYY11Y", "B001JNNDJM", "B00005JKQS"], "bought_together": ["0783240295"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0021L8V0M", "B001GKJ2E8", "B000AP04FG", "B001NFNFNU"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 54618}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.95, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00005JMWP", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/513DTkJ5nnL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Taking Lives - Director's Cut (Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "A ratings hit for eight seasons on CBS, the action-mystery seriesMagnum, P.I.makes its DVD boxed set debut in an impressive five-disc package that offers not only the entire first season, but some rarely seen episodes. Positioned in the oldHawaii Five-Otime slot (Thursdays at 9) in December of 1980,Magnumquickly became a hit, thanks to the combination of smart and witty scripting, gorgeous locations, and the considerable charm of lead Tom Selleck as former Naval Intelligence officer Thomas Magnum, who gives up his position to become a private investigator on Oahu with the help of fellow Vietnam vets T.C. (Roger E. Mosley) and Rick (Larry Manetti). Magnum also provided security for the lavish estate of wealthy (and never-seen) mystery writer Robin Masters, which gave him access to the author's expensive vehicles (including a prized Ferrari), much to the disapproval of Masters's manservant Higgins (Jonathan Hillerman).A rare series that skillfully blended action, humor, drama, and suspense,Magnum, P.I.'s first season gets the boxed set treatment its fans have been hoping for, with all 18 first-season episodes (including the two-part pilot, \"Don't Eat the Snow in Hawaii\") included on four discs. The fifth disc contains four rarely shown bonus episodes, including season 3's \"Ki'ls Don't Lie,\" which featured a crossover plot withSimon and Simon, as well as its conclusion (\"Emeralds Are Not a Girl's Best Friend\"), which kicked offS&S;'s second season; the latter episode has never been aired as part ofMagnum's syndicated package, which is another reason for fans to pick up and enjoy this long-awaited set.--Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0007LXP86", "B000BUE5DC", "B000E5KQMI", "B000HXDWG4", "B000M9BPGC", "B00113ALL8", "B000BGR1B4", "B000TZX5XK", "B000GW8UAE", "B000LE16VC", "B000BF0C8E", "B000LXGXY8", "B001JTRKHW", "B00005JLEY", "B000N2HD6O", "B00005JO3P", "B002WQ79A4", "B000BKVKSA", "B000PGTPC8", "B00FWMVVJ0", "B000ASDFIG", "B001DHXT7U", "B0024FAD7Y", "B000XJD3K2", "B004UV3KSE", "B001JFKWE4", "B000HWZ4HU", "B00E8AVN9A", "B00005JN8S", "B000BUE5D2", "B000WQWPSM", "B000MLWQ6I", "B000OVLMKC", "B007AAF3FK", "B0030Y12AK", "B0007LXP7W", "B001S86IYK", "B00008NV4G", "B0009FU0ZQ", "B001675ZJM", "B000GRU09I", "B0014FAIXE", "B00H4ZEJAG", "B005LFQRTC", "B00HZMZ286", "B00KTZALDC", "B0007CNY4K", "B0002NY81C", "B00DYQ1G78", "B001J0FVYK", "B000O77SNG", "B0007Y08SS", "B003BGZ60Y", "B0006IUDXA", "B000MLWQ6S", "B004MLEYV4", "B0009UC80G", "B00BUWD7NE", "B00009VRF0", "B00H4ZEJCO", "B00116GEK2", "B0002COTDA", "B00HUPC5QU", "B002XKKX8E", "B001E6HUXO", "B000TXPXCS", "B00HV0TJM2", "B001DMVZJ4", "B0009NZ36O", "B003XMKU3Y", "B001B187NO", "B0012EM5EW", "B000YKYT1M", "B000NJISJ8", "B00005JOJP", "B003ES5JJ2", "B000E5KQM8", "B002ZTLVXY", "B008H6GHII", "B002LFQIL2", "B000BOH8YG", "B0006N2EZK", "B000GNOSHW", "B0025X4PAQ", "B003R4ZMNQ", "B000E5KQLY", "B000B8IA3U", "B000F9T70K", "B000K7UBXE", "B00008972G", "B004DCM5RC", "B00005JM3A", "B003W5C0TY", "B005TFVM0I", "B00471JT0K", "B0028S110K", "B00008EY6N", "B0030VANJO", "B00H4ZEJ6K", "B000Q6GUSE"], "bought_together": ["B0007LXP86", "B000BUE5DC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00DYQ1G78", "B000BF0C8E", "B000E5KQMI", "B000BGR1B4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 14692}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 14.46, "brand": "UNI DIST CORP.

{"description": "Like any DVD blockbuster from producer Jerry Bruckheimer, the extras are plentiful and often a bit too self-congratulatory (worst offender here is the primary commentary track). The slickly (natch) produced making-of documentary goes through the standard routine; however, the less-flashy \"fly on the wall\" bits--just showing what happens on set without comment--is more fun, offering effortless insight on the filmmaking process. The best treasure is a nifty interactive history on pirates with plenty of background material. You can simply play the filmed segments or take a tour around a ship to discover the material (and a few surprises). There's a lot of archival material on the theme-park ride that inspired the film and several odds and ends including an enjoyable chronicle of the vintage ship's voyage from its home harbor to the movie set. The kids should really dig the DVD-ROM \"Moonlight Becomes Ye,\" in which they can turn their own mug into a ghostly pirate. There's also a bounty of extended and deleted scenes (19 in all) and a very funny blooper reel. With both DTS and Dolby 5.1, sound systems will get a workout with the excellent (and loud) sound design.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000I0RQVI", "B000U7WV1Y", "B005COPWZW", "B004A8ZWUQ", "B00005JN5E", "B0013BM63O", "B006VRRGNK", "B00005JKZV", "B00005JPH2", "B0014Z4OMU", "B00E5I2MCM", "B00003CWT6", "B004DTLK80", "B00005JKZY", "B0000A1RJI", "B004M1A21K", "B004DTLK7G", "B00003CXZ1", "B001HN694K", "B001E75QH0", "B00E5I2M6I", "B00005JKCH", "B0087ZG7HK", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B000E6EK2Y", "B000E8M0VA", "B003UYUQZW", "B00AEFYGBA", "B000W746GK", "B00005JMQW", "B0083SBMBM", "B001DHXT20", "B0002234LS", "B000W7F5SS", "B002PMV9FG", "B0002KVUKM", "B004EPYZUS", "B0053FANRC", "B00BEZTMFY", "6304806434", "B000VR0570", "0783231644", "B001OQCV6A", "B000AYELVA", "B008JFUO72", "B005G4TJUC", "B00004R99S", "B00023B1LC", "B00E5I2M9K", "B00003CXI1", "B001HQZJMU", "B00000IRE6", "B0002ZDVEU", "B008QE9XD2", "B00F84H73Q", "B00E5I2MEK", "B003Y5H5EW", "B007K3JFUQ", "B003QO8TOQ", "B000NQRR1Q", "B000YPUF9W", "B001EZE5BU", "B004A8ZWSS", "B0009MDPYM", "B00LG6YEKE", "B002ZG980U", "B002ZG994U", "B000U1ZV8K", "B001DZ8TRW", "B00005JLR2", "B000VWYJ86", "B00AZMFJYA", "B001GZ6QC4", "B00000JQB5", "B004XKCZAG", "B000W796OM", "B001GCUO0W", "B00AQSN7HE", "B00000ILDH", "B0053FANT0", "B0000VAFO0", "B0002IQMAM", "B000HRMAPE", "B004LWZW7Y", "B008UZA8FY", "B0001HLVS2", "B00007AJGH", "B00005JNJV", "B003YAR97K", "B00CHVJODE", "B000UR9T8C", "B0049IHX2C", "B000G6BLW4", "B00177YA1K", "0783227345", "B0014Z4ON4", "B001TK80C0", "B002O5M4T4", "B00AEBBA72", "B00005JOC9"], "bought_together": ["B000I0RQVI", "B000U7WV1Y"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005COPWZW", "B000I0RQVI", "B0071JADFU", "B00005JPFX"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 6260}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.23, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B00005JM5E", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51fX40gGdXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)"}

{"description": "Jamie Foxx's uncannily accurate performance isn't the only good thing aboutRay. Riding high on a wave of Oscar buzz, Foxx proved himself worthy of all the hype by portraying blind R&B; legend Ray Charles in a warts-and-all performance that Charles approved shortly before his death in June 2004. Despite a few dramatic embellishments of actual incidents (such as the suggestion that the accidental drowning of Charles's younger brother caused all the inner demons that Charles would battle into adulthood), the film does a remarkable job of summarizing Charles's strengths as a musical innovator and his weaknesses as a philandering heroin addict who recorded some of his best songs while flying high as a kite. Foxx seems to be channeling Charles himself, and as he did with the life of Ritchie Valens in La Bamba, director Taylor Hackford gets most of the period details absolutely right as he chronicles Ray's rise from \"chitlin circuit\" performer in the early '50s to his much-deserved elevation to legendary status as one of the all-time great musicians. Foxx expertly lip-syncs to Ray Charles' classic recordings, but you could swear he's the real deal in a film that honors Ray Charles without sanitizing his once-messy life.--Jeff ShannonMore on Ray CharlesModern Sounds in Country and Western Music(CD)The Genius of Ray Charles(CD)Ray Charles and Betty Carter--Dedicated to You(CD)Genius & Soul--The 50th Anniversary Collection(CD)Ray: A Tribute to the Movie, the Music, and the Man(book)More Albums by Ray Charles", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000E8QVWY", "B001P3SA94", "B00465I1CE", "B00005JKMQ", "6305428409", "B003BV8I3Q", "B00AEFXTKO", "B0002LE9HC", "B000BOH8X2", "B00AEFYG3S", "0790739313", "B000JJSL1W", "B000A50460", "B00005TQ44", "0783230524", "B0009R1TJ0", "0780627822", "B00AEFZ63M", "B000P0J092", "B002VWNICM", "B00EV4EUT8", "B000JLTRH2", "B000N6U0E2", "B0041QSZS8", "0783237367", "078324228X", "B00AEFY6TW", "B003HKN534", "B00BTYPWDQ", "B00G4Q3KOC", "B00007AJG1", "B00007L4KF", "B00ANDDBBY", "B000BITV9W", "0783114907", "B00007AJG2", "1558908390", "B00005JLRZ", "B000FVQLQQ", "6305692572", "0767821637", "B002CA68NO", "B00AFEXRME", "B002CPMB9O", "B004SIP93S", "B000063JDI", "B00005NB8K", "B00125WAWS", "6305505780", "B000IFRT4W", "B001TUZGPO", "B009NNM9OA", "B000RB6XG2", "B000P0J0CY", "B0001FR3IQ", "B000FVQLRA", "B00066FAVW", "B002XMGGK6", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00DW5IL2E", "B00005JPK8", "0767811070", "B000I0QL7I", "B000069I0E", "B00080ZG10", "0306814315", "B000P0J0EM", "B00AEFXP8K", "B00049QQHI", "B00000JGHV", "B0007CEXYK", "B0001Q4BOE", "B0000YEE6M", "B000NIVJF4", "B008Y1YJN6", "B00066VTU8", "B001132GNY", "B0006QAIG4", "B0034G4OSG", "B000C20VRS", "0800141741", "B00A2H9QN8", "B000Y11B8K", "B00005LB86", "B000056VP4", "B00005JL72", "B000095J01", "B000Q7ZNZ4", "B002CAWNEM", "B003UESJHO", "B00066FAQW", "0783230389", "B0013FDM7E", "B00007ELEO", "B00AMEZDJW", "B000P0J0CE", "B003Y5H4ZC", "0767821955", "B00003GPFT", "B0021L8V2A"], "bought_together": ["B000E8QVWY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0002LE9HC", "B000E8QVWY", "B000BOH8X2", "B00AZMFJYA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 17277}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.89, "brand": "Universal Studios", "asin": "B00005JND5", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41RQ8ETK19L._SX300_.jpg", "title": "Ray (Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "Batman Beginsdiscards the previous four films in the series and recasts the Caped Crusader as a fearsome avenging angel. That's good news, because the series, which had gotten off to a rousing start under Tim Burton, had gradually dissolved into self-parody by 1997'sBatman & Robin. As the title implies,Batman Beginstells the story anew, when Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) flees Western civilization following the murder of his parents. He is taken in by a mysterious instructor named Ducard (Liam Neeson in another mentor role) and urged to become a ninja in the League of Shadows, but he instead returns to his native Gotham City resolved to end the mob rule that is strangling it. But are there forces even more sinister at hand?Cowritten by the team of David S. Goyer (a veteran comic book writer) and director Christopher Nolan (Memento),Batman Beginsis a welcome return to the grim and gritty version of the Dark Knight, owing a great debt to the graphic novels that preceded it. It doesn't have the razzle dazzle, or the mass appeal, ofSpider-Man 2(though the Batmobile is cool), and retelling the origin means it starts slowly, like most \"first\" superhero movies. But it's certainly the best Bat-film since Burton's original, and one of the best superhero movies of its time. Bale cuts a good figure as Batman, intense and dangerous but with some of the lightheartedness Michael Keaton brought to the character. Michael Caine provides much of the film's humor as the family butler, Alfred, and as the love interest, Katie Holmes (Dawson's Creek) is surprisingly believable in her first adult role. Also featuring Gary Oldman as the young police officer Jim Gordon, Morgan Freeman as a Q-like gadgets expert, and Cillian Murphy as the vile Jonathan Crane.--David HoriuchiBatmanat Amazon.comAllBatmanDVDsBatman Begins101: A Comic Book PrimerWhere Have I Seen Christian Bale?AllBatmanComics and Graphic NovelsBatmanToysBatman BeginsSoundtrackStills fromBatman Begins(click for larger images)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001GZ6QC4", "B004LWZWGA", "B002GSXKN8", "B000P0J06U", "B001OST0LW", "B000P0J06K", "B004EPZ07K", "B00E5I2MCM", "B00005JKCH", "B001GCUO1Q", "B002ZG980U", "B001OST0M6", "B008JFUPFI", "B004LWZWFQ", "B00005JMQW", "B004LWZW42", "B000VI70QS", "B001DHXT20", "B000M341QE", "B0000959N0", "B000UR9T8C", "B00005JNTU", "B000AYELVA", "B00E5I2M6I", "B002IPFWTE", "B000HEVZ9E", "B0090SI56Y", "B002HWRYJE", "B0006L0LOS", "B000OVLBF8", "B00003CWT6", "B000VR0570", "B00E5I2MEK", "B000HCO83Q", "B0007P0Y7C", "B008JFUO72", "B00F4FFO8E", "B001CDR1FG", "B000P0J0EW", "B002T9H2LA", "B0002KVUKM", "B00E5I2M9K", "B00005N5S5", "B0083SBMBM", "B0001BKAEY", "B00AQSN7HE", "B000J10EQU", "B00005JKZY", "B002NXSRVG", "B000AYELVU", "B001OQCV6A", "B004LWZW4M", "B001VLBDD0", "B001GZ6QEC", "B004GJYRA0", "B007REV4T8", "B001TK80C0", "B000HRJLII", "B001QTXM5Y", "B005G4TJUC", "B00005JKZV", "B0053FANT0", "B00005JA8B", "B003YAR97K", "B004SIP9Z6", "B00001ZWUS", "B004EPYZQC", "B001N44BVQ", "B006VRRGNK", "B001AEF6HM", "B00000JQB5", "B00011CZRE", "B00AZMFJYA", "B00AEFY0F2", "B007K3JFUQ", "B0002IQMAM", "B00005JN0T", "B002SJIO4A", "B000VWYJ86", "B0013FDM7E", "B00005JNTI", "B00407PNY2", "B00DTPRZ24", "B008JFUS0U", "B00004Z4WR", "B000FS9FCG", "B000QXDED6", "B0085A9HU6", "0780624890", "B00005LOUK", "B000065U1N", "B000P0J0AG", "B00005JN5T", "B001QB9H1U", "B00005JMUA", "0792844890", "B0007DFJ0G", "B004EPYZSK", "B008JFUOWM", "B00AEFY5B6"], "bought_together": ["B001GZ6QC4", "B004LWZWGA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B009JBWOU0", "B001GZ6QC4", "B004LWZWGA", "B002ZG980U"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 7806}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.99, "brand": "DC Comics", "asin": "B00005JNJV", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518zjc4XtzL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Batman Begins (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "Despite super effects, a huge budget, and the cinematic pedigree of alien-happy Steven Spielberg, this take on H.G. Wells's novel is basically a horror film packaged as a sci-fi thrill ride. Instead of a mad slasher, however, Spielberg (along with writers Josh Friedman & David Koepp) utilizes aliens hell-bent on quickly destroying humanity, and the terrifying results that prey upon adult fears, especially in the post-9/11 world. The realistic results could be a new genre, the grim popcorn thriller; often you feel like you're watching Schindler's List more than Spielberg's other thrill-machine movies (Jaws,Jurassic Park). The film centers on Ray Ferrier, a divorced father (Tom Cruise, oh so comfortable) who witnesses one giant craft destroy his New Jersey town and soon is on the road with his teen son (Justin Chatwin) and preteen daughter (Dakota Fanning) in tow, trying to keep ahead of the invasion. The film is, of course, impeccably designed and produced by Spielberg's usual crew of A-class talent. The aliens are genuinely scary, even when the film--like the novel--spends a good chunk of time in a basement. Readers of the book (or viewers of the deft 1953 adaptation) will note the variation of whom and how the aliens come to Earth, which poses some logistical problems. The film opens and closes with narration from the novel read by Morgan Freeman, but Spielberg could have adapted Orson Welles's words from the famous Halloween Eve 1938 radio broadcast: \"We couldn't soap all your windows and steal all your garden gates by tomorrow night, so we did the best next thing: we annihilated the world.\"--Doug ThomasWar of the Worldsat Amazon.comThe SoundtrackThe War of the Worlds(1953)War of the Worlds - The Complete First Season(TV series)Classic Sci-Fi Movies and Their RemakesAliens Invade on DVDThe Prog-rock Opera (no kidding)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEBB8VK", "B00005JL78", "B001SGEUYW", "B00008G8M4", "B00005JL3T", "B0013FDM7E", "B00AEFXNLY", "B00005JMXX", "B001OQCV2E", "B000VECAD0", "B002O3Z510", "B0002V7OI8", "B000H30B2C", "B000EGDB10", "B00005JN2Z", "B005LAIIMG", "B005PTYP70", "B002O3Z50G", "B0002V7ON8", "B00005JN0T", "B00K2CHW48", "B002SJIO4A", "0783225547", "B008JFUO36", "B00005JKLZ", "B00AS1Q93S", "1936594056", "B004EPYZUS", "B001TUZG4K", "B00AEFXR1K", "B00001ZWUS", "B00AEFXYJA", "0767817478", "B0034G4ORC", "B003QO8TOQ", "B00070FX5U", "B0045HCJSA", "B00000G3PA", "B005LAIHPE", "B003Y5H5GK", "B00AEBBA72", "B00003CWU3", "B00I9TDMRM", "B001ECDVKE", "B00003CXXP", "B000V4UFZK", "B0010X73ZG", "B001DZOC6Y", "B00005JKFR", "B000XT1P4S", "B003HKN52U", "B0009PW4D2", "B000HRMAPE", "B004EPYZPS", "B0018QPPXW", "B0002WZTOI", "B00AEBB9LO", "B004LWZW4M", "B003ABZHAO", "B003YJFALS", "B0087ZG7HK", "B000OT6V64", "B004P7CN7W", "B000CCBC9O", "B00000ILDD", "0767803434", "B001L57ZYM", "B000065V3G", "B007STBUHI", "B002ZG980U", "B008JFUQZ2", "B00005B6JZ", "B0006GANOQ", "B000F1IQN2", "1494343576", "B001GCUO02", "B00004Y87O", "0783226810", "B004EPYZSK", "B000P0J0BU", "B005LAIHXQ", "B001680M26", "B000EQHXN2", "B0045HCJFS", "B00004BZIY", "B00008G8M5", "B00003CXQA", "B008JFUS0U", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00EIN6KJ0", "B0000DZ6N3", "B000MV8A9A", "B00005JKYX", "B0000YEEGM", "B000TGJ8CQ", "B0013FCWUW", "B002ZG9864", "B00003CWTI", "B008MIMWQW", "B00IKM5OCO"], "bought_together": ["B00AEBB8VK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AEBB8VK", "B004LWZW4M", "B00005JL78", "B004EPYZSK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 18739}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.95, "brand": "Dreamworks Skg", "asin": "B00005JNTI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51upxzPRnXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "War of the Worlds"}
{"description": "Marvel Comics' first family of superherodom, the Fantastic Four, hits the big screen in a light-hearted and funny adventure.  It begins when down-on-his-luck genius Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd,Horatio Hornblower) has to enlist the financial and intellectual help from former schoolmate and rival Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon,Nip/Tuck) in order to pursue outer-space research into human DNA.  Also on the trip are Reed's best friend, Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis,The Shield); his former lover, Sue Storm (Jessica Alba,Dark Angel,Sin City), who's now Doom's employee and love interest; and her hotshot-pilot brother, Johnny Storm (Chris Evans,Cellular).  Things don't go as planned, of course, and the quartet becomes blessed--or is it cursed?--with superhuman powers: flexibility, brute strength, invisibility and projecting force fields, and bursting into flame.  Meanwhile, Doom himself is undergoing a transformation.Among the many entries in the comic-book-movie frenzy,Fantastic Fouris refreshing because it doesn't take itself too seriously. Characterization isn't too deep, and the action is a bit sparse until the final reel (like most \"first\" superhero movies, it has to go through the \"how did we get these powers and what we will do with them\" churn). But it's a good-looking cast, and original comic-book cocreator Stan Lee makes his most significant Marvel-movie cameo yet, in a speaking role as the FF's steadfast postal carrier, Willie Lumpkin. Newcomers to superhero movies might find the idea of a family with flexibility, strength, invisibility, and force fields a retread ofThe Incredibles, but Pixar's animated film was very much a tribute to the FF and other heroes of the last 40 years. The irony is that whileFantastic Fouris an enjoyable B-grade movie, it's the tribute,The Incredibles, that turned out to be a film for the ages.--David HoriuchiOn the DVDThe principal extra on the DVD is a spirited commentary track by Jessica Alba, Michael Chiklis, and Ioan Gruffud.  Self-avowed FF fan Chiklis explains why the Thing doesn't have a craggy brow, Alba recalls which things were \"cool,\" and they talk about looking forward to the sequel. There are three short deleted scenes (including a goofy Wolverine reference), 20 minutes of barely watchable hand-held video footage from the press tour, music videos, and some short featurettes including an appearance by FF creator Stan Lee.--David HoriuchiThe Fantastic Four at Amazon.comComics and Graphic NovelsDisney animated seriesThe classic comic bookMovie tie-in graphic novelThe Xbox gameFantastic FourSoundtrackThe Fantastic CastJessica Albaas Sue StormMichael Chiklisas The ThingIoan Gruffuddas Reed RichardsChris Evansas Johnny StormStills fromFantastic Four(click for larger images)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000VI70QS", "B0000959N0", "B001DHXT20", "B0007P0Y7C", "B004EPZ07K", "B001CDR1FG", "B00E5I2MEK", "B001GCUO1Q", "B00E5I2M9K", "B00E5I2MCM", "B000OVLBF8", "B00005JMQW", "B008JFUO72", "B004LWZW42", "B00E5I2M6I", "B000UR9T8C", "B0090SI56Y", "B000HEVZ9E", "B000HCO83Q", "B00005JKCH", "B005OY6LBE", "B001OQCVI8", "B008JFUS0U", "B004LWZWFQ", "B000AYELVU", "B0002IQMAM", "B003YAR97K", "B0083SBMBM", "B001QB9H1U", "B001AK3S4Y", "B005LAIGW8", "B000AYELVA", "B001F7MSFM", "B0006L0LOS", "B003H8F3AY", "B008JFUPFI", "B006DHAT5K", "B002GSXKN8", "B002ZG99G8", "B00005JNJV", "B002IPFWTE", "B002NXSRVG", "B000VR0570", "B0006D3HGA", "B004LWZWGA", "B005LAII44", "B000YV1Q2G", "B00F4FFO8E", "B005G4TJUC", "B00005JN0T", "B0007US7CQ", "B00E1HIXEI", "B000J10EQU", "B0002KVUKM", "B000VKL6T8", "B001TK80C0", "B002ZG99B8", "B000Y7U98C", "B002GSXKNI", "B00005JM5B", "B001GZ6QC4", "B000PFUAP0", "B00005JKWJ", "B0009P42WI", "B00174RCHW", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B00005JKYX", "B005TK0MFE", "B000VNMMPW", "B001QTXM5Y", "B000EU1Q7M", "B00008G8M4", "B000P6XQ50", "B00005JN5E", "B0007V6ITE", "B001VLBDD0", "B005LAIH54", "B001FB55HQ", "B000IJ79WU", "B008Y1YK9Y", "B00561BNJK", "B001VLFE7G", "B000CNER1S", "B00K7IPFSM", "B001BP4K22", "B00005JL78", "B0001CNRS4", "B00979KQD6", "B00157OI9Q", "B004EPYZUS", "B002HWRYJE", "B009YQJ322", "B003Y5H5EW", "0780624890", "B001RHGRT8", "B0013J55B6", "B0013BM63O", "B0053FANPY", "B009MO57H6", "078401132X"], "bought_together": ["B000VI70QS", "B001DHXT20"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000VI28Z6", "B000VI70QS", "B008JFUS0U", "B0090SI56Y"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 12162}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.98, "brand": "Twentieth Century Fox", "asin": "B00005JNTU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51AM4R5J04L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Fantastic Four (Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "The delightful designs of William Joyce (writer/illustrator of such popular children's books asGeorge ShrinksandBently & Egg) makeRobotsa joy to behold. The round, bouncy, and ramshackle forms of hero Rodney Copperbottom and his computer-animated friends are part of an ornate and daffyFender providing assistance.Rube-Goldberg universe of elaborate contraptions and gleaming metallic surfaces.  Rodney (voiced with a hint-of-Scottish lilt by Ewan McGregor) is a young inventor who sets off for Robot City to work for Big Weld (Mel Brooks), the supreme inventor of the mechanical world.  But upon his arrival, Rodney discovers that Big Weld has disappeared, and the slick, shiny Ratchet (Greg Kinnear,As Good As It Gets) is phasing out the spare parts that lumpen robots need to function and replacing them with \"upgrades\"--expensive and glistening new exoskeletons. Unfortunately, from this suitable beginning, the story degenerates into a series of action sequences that make very little sense, though some are kinetic and fun (though others are only there to serve the inevitableRobotsvideo game). Most kids will enjoy the sheer visual pleasure of the movie, but compared to the narrative richness of Pixar movies likeThe IncrediblesandToy Story, that pleasure is pretty short-lived. Also featuring the voices of Robin Williams, Halle Berry, Jim Broadbent, Amanda Bynes, Jennifer Coolidge, and many, many more.--Bret FetzerDVD FeaturesJennifer Coolidge returns as the voice of Aunt Fanny in a mildly amusing new short, \"Aunt Fanny's Tour of Booty,\" which allows her to again be the butt of the joke.  Fans of the characters will enjoy both a 17-minute discussion of the robots' creation as well as profiles of 11 of the bots, including early, almost unrecognizable conceptual sketches and brief interviews with the voice cast.  The original short is fairly dull, and of the three deleted scenes, the most finished is an extended version of Rodney's initial meeting with Tim at the gate.  One other is in sketch form only but does preserve another performance by Robin Williams.  The kids' games are pretty good.  There's a dancing robot that will perform eight routines on command or in random order.  A memory game has a bit of replay value, and the build-a-bot segment takes some thought and investigation.  The Xbox demo is a nifty little diversion that transforms one element (the transport-pod race) of the full-length, single-player Xbox game into a frenetic one- to four-player free-for-all.In their commentary track, director Chris Wedge and producer-inspiration William Joyce have to remind each other to stop patting themselves on the back, but it is interesting to hear them talk about old games such as Mousetrap that played a part in developing the film.  (Wedge's frequent references to a possible \"director's cut\" might not seem like a joke to DVD buyers who have gotten tired of DVD rereleases.)  The commentary track by the Blue Sky technical team might be better, offering insights into the characters and the creation of the film without lapsing into too much techie-speak.--David HoriuchiStills fromRobots(click for larger image)The World ofRobotsThe Art of RobotsRobotssoundtrackRobotsscoreRobotsfor XboxRobotsfor PS2Robotsfor GBA", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0006JMLRK", "B000M343BC", "B002WJI2QQ", "B001DPHDCY", "B0012EM5D8", "B004HO6I4M", "B00003CXJ4", "B00CWM58WY", "B000MV9026", "B0006UEVT0", "B001GCUO7A", "0783231474", "B005SDUV4E", "B000RMJ4F8", "B0000640SC", "B000ROAK2W", "B0013FSL3E", "B001LPWGFA", "B004EPZ034", "B001U3D88M", "B000ION23A", "B005LAIISA", "B0000AOX0O", "B000UFIYOO", "B001PR0YEE", "6305161887", "B00029LO0Y", "B008NNY9QW", "B000G75AZC", "B000H7JCK0", "B006JD48LO", "B000L22SG6", "B00B7EQPNE", "B001ECQ75A", "B004AKCME8", "B000AY74OG", "B000VBJEEG", "B00F522C7C", "B000DWMYQ8", "B002ZG97YM", "B008JFUQ16", "B004LWZW7Y", "B000BITUVG", "B0000VV4W2", "B005LAIH4A", "B00003CXG7", "B00005JMQZ", "B00007LVCM", "B0042U94UQ", "B00CHVJODE", "B001PR0Y7Q", "B00E9ZATJO", "B00009M9BK", "0449810798", "B0090SI1RM", "B00BG0RSJ4", "B001KVZ6FW", "1620575175", "B009AMAH3O", "B00I6JOD2S", "B000CZ0PT4", "B0013FSWT2", "B0034G4OYA", "B00AFEX83C", "B000UVKGPI", "B000065V42", "B0039N74CW", "B00JK531ES", "B00HLTD2OE", "B002ZG9904", "B00009YXAW", "6305123454", "B005FLSZQU", "B00005JM7T", "B001GCUNWQ", "B003UESJF6", "B00E00OGE2", "B001HN6918", "B000GUJZ00", "B00I0VTOMG", "B00005JNS0", "B00365F6I2", "B000EQ5UHS", "B000LPS2VI", "B00005JN4W", "B000B8QFYG", "B001NCDFTW", "B0030ZIZRC", "B00CTNYLQA", "B00G5G7EXY", "B007FF3HQM", "B00947N6D8", "B00EBBGLFC", "B005QODEEE", "B00ALMNCLQ", "B00362RUX4", "B00005JN0T", "B000GIXEWC", "B00005TN8K", "B005LAIIT4"], "bought_together": ["B00CWM58WY", "B004HO6I4M"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00CWM58WY", "B004HO6I4M", "B002WJI2QQ", "B001DPHDCY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 3335}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.95, "brand": "Fox Home Entertainment", "asin": "B00005JNQS", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61RM90ARRPL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Robots (Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "Along withDesperate Housewives,Lostwas one of the two breakout shows in the fall of 2004. Mixing suspense and action with a sci-fi twist, it began with a thrilling pilot episode in which a jetliner traveling from Australia to Los Angeles crashes, leaving 48 survivors on an unidentified island with no sign of civilization or hope of imminent rescue. That may sound likeGilligan's IslandmeetsSurvivor, butLostkept viewers tuning in every Wednesday night--and spending the rest of the week speculating on Web sites--with some irresistible hooks (not to mention the beautiful women). First, there's a huge ensemble cast of no fewer than 14 regular characters, and each episode fills in some of the back story on one of them. There's a doctor; an Iraqi soldier; a has-been rock star; a fugitive from justice; a self-absorbed young woman and her brother; a lottery winner; a father and son; a Korean couple; a pregnant woman; and others. Second, there's a host of unanswered questions: What is the mysterious beast that lurks in the jungle? Why do polar bears and wild boars live there? Why has a woman been transmitting an SOS message in French from somewhere on the island for the last 16 years? Why do impossible wishes seem to come true? Are they really on a physical island, or somewhere else? What is the significance of the recurring set of numbers? And will Kate ever give up her bad-boy fixation and hook up with Jack?Lostdid have some hiccups during the first season. Some plot threads were left dangling for weeks, and the \"oh, it didn't really happen\" card was played too often. But the strong writing and topnotch cast kept the show a cut above most network TV. The best-known actor at the time of the show's debut was Dominic Monaghan, fresh off his stint as Merry the Hobbit in Peter Jackson'sLord of the Ringsfilms. The rest of the cast is either unknowns or \"where I have I seen that face before\" supporting players, including Matthew Fox and Evangeline Lilly, who are the closest thing to leads. Other standouts include Naveen Andrews, Terry O'Quinn (who's made a nice career out of conspiracy-themed TV shows), Josh Holloway, Jorge Garcia, Yunjin Kim, Maggie Grace, and Emilie de Ravin, but there's really not a weak link in the cast.

The episodes are presented in widescreen format, just as they were broadcast on high-definition channels. (Conventional ABC-TV broadcasts were reduced to 1.33 full-screen format.) Four of the episodes have commentary tracks by the producing team and the actors who were featured on certain episodes (Terry O'Quinn, Dominic Monaghan, and Maggie Grace and Ian Sommerhalder). The last disc has over three hours of bonus material sensibly broken into three categories. \"Departure\" discusses the initial creation of the series, the making of the pilot, and the cast (some characters were created to fit the actors, and Evangeline Lilly's Kate was the hardest to cast). It also includes the cast's audition tapes and photographs by Matthew Fox. \"Tales from the Island\" provides background material on seven of the episodes plus the boars used in filming, Jimmy Kimmel's appearance on the set, and the genesis of the Driveshaft song (\"You all everybody...\"). Finally, \"Lost Revealed\" includes two scenes cut from the season finale, 13 other deleted scenes (not identified by episode, unfortunately), a blooper reel, and the cast and crew's giddy appearance at the Museum of Television & Radio.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000FIMG68", "B000P6YNSE", "B0018CWEYY", "B0019LY5IM", "B0036EH3XE", "B000ESSSK2", "B00G4SD75W", "B000QDLSR0", "B0018CWEZ8", "B001AQMBKA", "B000FKO3GW", "B0036EH3X4", "B000TFINY6", "B001B7CNZ6", "B002N5N5MK", "B002JVWRD6", "B0024FAD9C", "0756665949", "B00129W6LE", "B000BNI90Y", "1550227432", "1550228781", "1550227998", "B000YABIQ6", "1550229516", "1550228919", "B000AJJNFE", "B0009VBTP0", "B001AQMBJQ", "B0009A407A", "B000F3UAE8", "B000RO6JY0", "B0026RHR6U", "0615508294", "B001DJLCRC", "B0001O3YLM", "B001QE99AQ", "B003R0MEYA", "B003L77GJM", "B000FIMG5Y", "B00062IDEW", "1463548702", "B0038M2APA", "B0024FAR66", "B004TJ1GY2", "B002AMVED8", "B001MVWRNO", "B000I0QLR8", "B0000Y40PW", "B0024F08RO", "B000NDEXK2", "B001C4CI8U", "B00008YGRU", "B000FFJYC0", "B000N3T0EG", "B000EWBNMI", "B004LROMSO", "B00FFSTPDU", "B001HUWQEA", "B000GETTKM", "B00IWTVDUW", "B0024FAD9W", "B003L77GTC", "B002U0KHME", "B000FVQLIO", "B000W6ZUUC", "B0049P1VHS", "B009LDD4V4", "B0075FF5QM", "B0038M2AOG", "B000FOPPBA", "B001934SNM", "B0055SNHQG", "B00D2ZF24O", "B00079FUI6", "B0053O8A46", "B004YM6JK0", "B00B5ARKC0", "B00DII0MGI", "B00005JO9J", "B002BFBB0A", "B000AJJNI6", "B000Q6GUW0", "B002GOAH1A", "B00BHLTIXQ", "B008H6GHF6", "B003L77G2Y", "B00000FBH2", "B000FIMG4U", "B005S97V82", "B00CWIMVDW", "B000Q6GUKW", "B000P6YNSO", "B001GCUER0", "B001G0MFIS", "B0001HAGQK", "B001VPJYZK", "B001VPJYZ0", "0425188809", "B000BOH986"], "bought_together": ["B000FIMG68", "B000P6YNSE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000FIMG68", "B0036EH3XE", "B0018CWEYY", "B000P6YNSE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 5709}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 16.5, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B00005JNOG", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51nb5sJm%2B3L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Lost - The Complete First Season"}
{"description": "Critics and controversy aside,The Da Vinci Codeis a verifiable blockbuster. Combine the film's huge worldwide box-office take with over 100 million copies of Dan Brown's book sold, andThe Da Vinci Codehas clearly made the leap from pop-culture hit to a certifiable franchise. The leap for any story making the move from book to big screen, however, is always more perilous. In the case ofThe Da Vinci Code, the plot is concocted of such a preposterous formula of elements that you wouldn&#x92;t envy screenwriter Akiva Goldsman, the man tasked with making this story filmable. The script followsDan Brown&#x92;s bookas closely as possible while incorporating a few needed changes, including a better ending. And if you&#x92;re like most of the world, by now you&#x92;ve read the book and know how it goes: while lecturing in Paris, noted Harvard Professor of Symbology Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) is summoned to the Louvre by French police to help decipher a bizarre series of clues left at the scene of the murder of the chief curator. Enter Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou), gifted cryptologist. Neveu and Langdon team up to solve the mystery, and from there the story is propelled across Europe, ballooning into a modern-day mini-quest for the Holy Grail, where secret societies are discovered, codes are broken, and murderous albino monks are thwarted&#x85; oh, and alternative theories about the life of Christ and the beginnings of Christianity are presented too, of course. It&#x92;s not the typical formula for a stock Hollywood thriller. In fact, taken solely as a mystery, the movie almost works--despite some gaping holes--mostly just because it keeps moving. Brown&#x92;s greatest trick was  to have the entire story take place in one day, so the action is forced to keep moving, despite some necessary pauses for exposition. As a screen couple, Hanks and Tautou are just fine together but not exactly memorable; meanwhile Sir Ian McKellen&#x92;s scenery-chewing as pivotal character Sir Leigh Teabing is just what the film needed to keep it from taking itself too seriously. The whole thing is like a good roller-coaster ride: try not to think too much about it--just sit back and enjoy the trip.--Daniel VanciniVisit The Da Vinci Code StoreOn The DVDThe DVD extras on a film as popular asThe Da Vinci Codeshould be plentiful, and this version doesn&#x92;t skimp. With over 90 minutes of special features, including ten behind-the-scenes featurettes, there&#x92;s a lot here to explore beyond the film itself. The question is, is there anything new here that we haven&#x92;t heard before, in all the hype, pseudo-documentaries, and controversy surrounding the movie, to make it worthwhile?  For most viewers, the answer will be \"yes.\" Essentially, if you like the movie, if you enjoyed the book, you will get a lot out of them.Just as the movie is intended to make the book come to life, the DVD extras should make the film come to life by pointing the audience into the world of the filmmakers, connecting the dots between print and film, and for the most part they do just that. The extras here range from the typical look behind-the-scenes to more in-depth features on the supporting characters, the locations, and theMona Lisaherself.  \"First Day on the Set with Ron Howard\" features the director gushing about the opportunity to film in the Louvre and work with Tom Hanks again (the two worked together before onSplashandApollo 13). It&#x92;s a short piece that doesn&#x92;t reveal much beyond making an attempt to share Howard&#x92;s excitement (with the \"Gee, I really loved working with him/her on this project\" that you hear in every such featurette), but viewers might enjoy seeing how the stage was set up in the famous museum, down to the spike tape on the floor showing actors where to hit their marks.The Filmmaking Experience, Parts 1 and 2further explores the creative and technical aspects of the filmmaking process.A Conversation with Dan Brownstarts out feeling like a puff-piece (the man who wrote this book got started at age 5 with a story calledThe Giraffe, The Pig, and the Pants on Fire. \"It was a thriller,\" he says.) and unfortunately it doesn&#x92;t go very deep into much of anything of interest. But on the other hand, this isn&#x92;t60 Minuteshere; it&#x92;s intended to give viewers a better sense of the man behind the franchise, which it does.  Much of the footage from this interview is sprinkled throughout some of the other featurettes. Meanwhile, the character behind the franchise, Robert Langdon, is examined in his own featurette, as is Sophie Neveu. The cool thing here is getting under the skin of the actors to see how they approached the characters, knowing that most of the movie-going public already has formed their own ideas about the characters from the book.The most interesting extras are the featurettes that focus on the history behind the mystery. Or is it the mystery behind the history?  Either way, the first one on theMona Lisa, and the second featurette on the many codes and symbols that are hidden throughout the movie balance out the remainder of the extras nicely by demonstrating the sense of intrigue, mystery, and game-playing adventure that madeThe Da Vinci Codeso popular in the first place.--Daniel VanciniBeyondThe Da Vinci CodeThe Films of Tom HanksThe Films of Ron HowardThe Da Vinci DVDs: Decoding \"The Da Vinci Code\"More About The ArtistStills fromThe Da Vinci Code(click for larger image)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002O5M4T4", "B00005JN5E", "B0013BM63O", "B002ZTQVKM", "B0007XG02W", "B001OLP2TI", "B002C68WNW", "0307474275", "B002O5M4SU", "B00005JLSB", "B000PHVZNE", "B0077ATSSQ", "B00AEFY0F2", "B000EPR7NE", "0743486226", "B001LMAK9W", "B000P0J0EW", "0385504209", "B005HWAOP2", "B001OQCV2E", "B0013XZ2QK", "B001EZE5D8", "B00005JL3T", "B000EOTW0Q", "6304711891", "B000YDBPAM", "0307950689", "B000HT386M", "B00008G8M4", "B000P0J0EM", "B002ZG99KO", "0800141806", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B00001ZWUS", "B0002V7OI8", "B002O3Z50Q", "B0006GANOQ", "B002NZK5UU", "B000NQRR1Q", "0385504225", "B004SIP7ZS", "B00005Y71F", "B000OYC7BW", "B00DL48BM6", "B00026ZG10", "B0018CWW5K", "B00004BZIY", "B0000B1OFL", "B00023B1LC", "B000N6U0E2", "B00A8MGIZG", "B00005JM5E", "B002LMV7R0", "B00004Z4WR", "B000K2UGXO", "B00005JMYC", "B001MVYUQG", "B00005JLWN", "B000056PMU", "B0000AOV4I", "B00AEFY4CG", "B00441GYXS", "B001F12J0C", "B00ES28X3C", "B002ZG980U", "B001VLBDD0", "B00008K76U", "B001TK80C0", "B008JFURII", "B000VWYJ86", "0792159659", "B00AEFYGBA", "B0009MDPYM", "B00177YA1K", "B00005N5S5", "B0043X1FM2", "B0002J58HO", "B00005JM5B", "B00AZMFJYA", "B003AWRMBA", "074349346X", "B003VA3JUO", "0783240295", "6305767866", "B0000844I8", "B000065U1N", "B002GHHHKQ", "B000K7VHQE", "B0000AXE8I", "0800177258", "B000ASDFGI", "B003Q6D2B4", "B000HRMAPE", "B000U7WV1Y", "B00005JMOW", "B00GPWEPZ8", "0312944926", "B000VI70QS", "B000KF0GWW"], "bought_together": ["B002O5M4T4", "B00005JN5E"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002O5M4T4", "B00I563DSC", "B0013BM63O", "1400079152"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 7555}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.5, "brand": "DaVinci", "asin": "B00005JOC9", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51SLBDLMtIL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Da Vinci Code (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition)"}

{"description": "Leonardo DiCaprio puts a handsome face on an ugly industry: In parts of Africa, diamond mining fuels civil warfare, killing thousands of innocents and drafting preteen children as vicious soldiers. DiCaprio (The Departed) plays Danny Archer, a white African soldier-turned-diamond-smuggler who gets wind of a large raw jewel found by Solomon Vandy, a native fisherman (Djimon Hounsou,In America) recently escaped from enslavement by a brutal rebel leader. Archer offers a deal: He'll help Vandy find his war-scattered family if Vandy will share the diamond with him. Drawn into this web of exploitation is journalist Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly,Little Children), who agrees to help if Archer will tell her the details of how conflict diamonds make their way into the hands of the corporations who sell them to the Western world. DiCaprio is compelling because he never flinches from Archer's utter ruthlessness; Archer ends up doing the morally justifiable thing, but only because his desperate greed has led him to it. Hounsou and Connelly, though saddled with all the moral and political speeches, rise above the cant and keep the movie's treacherously formulaic plot rooted in human characters. But in the end, the story won't stick with you as much as the dead stillness in the child soldiers' eyes; the horror of African civil strife refuses to be contained byBlood Diamond's uplifting message--and the movie is all the more potent as a result.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001N44BVQ", "B000M341QE", "B00005JLSB", "B00AEBB8NI", "B00080ZG10", "B004SIP7TE", "B006OFN0SE", "B002ZG980U", "B000NIVJF4", "B0007R4T3U", "B0016Q2D66", "B00049QQHI", "B001EZE5DI", "B00003CWM3", "B00008DP4C", "6305268827", "B000BYA5G4", "B00AEBB9F0", "B000Y7WGOW", "B004SIP7ZS", "B000065U1N", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B000095WW8", "B000U7169M", "B00DHHWXYY", "B000GFLKF8", "B004SIP8ZM", "B002O3Z510", "B002VWNIEA", "B002ZG99N6", "B0007DFJ0G", "B005LAIIJY", "0792839137", "B000KP62SE", "B000P0J0EW", "B000P0J09M", "B007SPPANM", "B00004XPPG", "B000C20VPA", "B00011CZRE", "B002QEHPQU", "B00005JN2Z", "B00AEBB9CS", "B00003CXWV", "B00AEFY5B6", "B00001ZWUS", "B00H9KKGTO", "B00005JN0W", "B002T9H2LA", "B000MTEFXC", "B003L20IG0", "B00AEBB86A", "B00005JKBC", "B0013XZ2QK", "B0000ACOXL", "B005LAIGRS", "B002AT8K9W", "B0007KIFGE", "B00AZNEW5G", "B003ASLJO0", "B000T28PII", "B002DU39GW", "B002ZG97RE", "B000LC55F2", "B00003CXTG", "B00AEBBA36", "B00B0U2SFE", "B003ASLJQI", "B002CPMB9O", "B00BB67UNW", "B000MXPE7O", "0783231202", "B000FVQLQQ", "B00AEFXVCU", "B00AEFXRRO", "B000A3XY5A", "B002JCSWV6", "B00005JNQA", "B004EPYZP8", "B0050MB4OO", "B000P0J0AG", "B000C65Z1G", "B00275EGWY", "B00005B6JZ", "B0006GANPA", "B00AEBB9NM", "B002XMGGK6", "B000C20VRS", "B0007P0XBO", "B003UESJME", "B000QXDED6", "B00AHTYI5M", "B001P9KR8U", "B004A8ZX28", "B008JFUNKU", "B003ASLJQS", "B002VWNICC", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00005BCKF", "B000NOIX48"], "bought_together": ["B000M341QE", "B002ZG980U"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AEBB8NI", "B00H9KKGTO", "B008MILL8W", "B000BYA5G4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 106777}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.96, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00005JPGO", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61MN8-6skUL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Blood Diamond (Two-Disc Special Edition)"}
{"description": "\"I bought a car. Turned out to be an alien robot. Who knew?\" deadpans Sam Witwicky, hero and human heart of Michael Bay's rollicking robot-smackdown fest,Transformers. Witwicky (the sweetly nerdy Shia LaBeouf, channeling a young John Cusack) is the perfect counterpoint to the nearly nonstop exhilarating action. The plot is simple: an alien civil war (the Autobots vs. the evil Decepticons) has spilled onto Earth, and young Sam is caught in the fray by his newly purchased souped-up Camaro. Which has a mind--and identity, as a noble-warrior robot named Bumblebee--of its own. The effects, especially the mind-blowing transformations of the robots into their earthly forms and back again, are stellar.Fans of the earlier film and TV series will be thrilled at this cutting-edge incarnation, but this version should please all fans of high-adrenaline action. Director Bay gleefully salts the movie with homages to pop-culture touchstones likeRaiders of the Lost Ark,King Kong, and the early technothrillerWarGames. The actors, though clearly all supporting those kickass robots, are uniformly on-target, including the dashing Josh Duhamel as a U.S. Army sergeant fighting an enemy he never anticipated; Jon Voight, as a tough yet sympathetic Secretary of Defense in over his head; and John Turturro, whose special agent manages to be confidently unctuous, even stripped to his undies. But the film belongs to Bumblebee, Optimus Prime, and the dastardly Megatron--and the wicked stunts they collide in all over the globe. Long live Transformers! --A.T. HurleyOn the DVDThe special edition ofTransformersis packed with extras (and more than a few product placements for Hasbro). The entire second disc is devoted to featurettes on aspects of making the technical tour-de-force--and the land mines involved in tinkering with a beloved '80s franchise. Executive producer Steven Spielberg is very much a part of the proceedings, from his introductory comments (\"I think everybody likes the idea of taking something you're familiar with and turning it into something you're not so familiar with--like an 18-wheeler become Optimus Prime\") to mentions of his films that influenced this one, likeE.T.andClose Encounters of the Third Kind.Director Michael Bay is brash and entertaining as he talks about his initial reluctance to take on the project, his indoctrination at \"Transformers U\" at Hasbro, and his enthusiasm for guerrilla-style action filmmaking. Star Shia LaBoeuf says, \"He is the sickest action director\" out there, and there's plenty of evidence here to support that. Other great highlights include features on how key scenes were shot, including the heart-pounding desert battle and the shootout in the streets of downtown L.A.--adrenaline-pumping stuff, even without the Transformers CGI'd in. --A.T.

{"description": "You know you're going to get a different kind of superhero when you cast Robert Downey Jr. in the lead role. AndIron Manis different, in welcome ways. Cleverly updated from Marvel Comics' longstanding series,Iron Manputs billionaire industrialist Tony Stark (that's Downey) in the path of some Middle Eastern terrorists; in a brilliantly paced section, Stark invents an indestructible suit that allows him to escape. If the rest of the movie never quite hits that precise rhythm again, it nevertheless offers plenty of pleasure, as the renewed Stark swears off his past as a weapons manufacturer, develops his new Iron Man suit, and puzzles both his business partner (Jeff Bridges in great form) and executive assistant (Gwyneth Paltrow). Director Jon Favreau geeks out in fun ways with the hardware, but never lets it overpower the movie, and there's always a goofy one-liner or a slapstick pratfall around to break the tension. As for Downey, he doesn't get to jitterbug around too much in his improv way, but he brings enough of his unpredictable personality to keep the thing fresh. And listen up, hardcore Marvel mavens: even if you know the Stan Lee cameo is coming, you won't be able to guess it until it's on the screen. It all builds to a splendid final scene, with a concluding line delivery by Downey that just feels absolutely right.--Robert HortonStills fromIron Man(Click for larger image)&nbsp;", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00E5I2M6I", "B008JFUO72", "B001DHXT20", "B00E5I2M9K", "B00E5I2MEK", "B0083SBMBM", "B008JFUS0U", "B001CDR1FG", "B00E5I2MAO", "B004LWZWFQ", "B001GCUO1Q", "B008JFUPFI", "B000VI70QS", "B000HEVZ9E", "B0000959N0", "B00005JKCH", "B00005JNJV", "B00005JNTU", "B0090SI56Y", "B000VR0570", "B00005JMQW", "B002HWRYJE", "B0007P0Y7C", "B004LWZW42", "B00D7OMNXS", "B001OQCV6A", "B007K3JFUQ", "B004EPZ07K", "B004LWZWGA", "B000UR9T8C", "B0083SBJXS", "B0060FXDCG", "B002IPFWTE", "B00E5I2ME0", "B00IXD2MGQ", "B000AYELVA", "B00C6B8TB8", "B008QZ5PY2", "B000OVLBF8", "B000AYELVU", "B00AZMFJYA", "B001QB9H1U", "B009JBWOU0", "B001AK3S4Y", "B001GZ6QC4", "B005G4TJUC", "B002NXSRVG", "B000HCO83Q", "B003YOZNBU", "B003Q6D2B4", "B00023B1LC", "B0002IQMAM", "B008JFURII", "B00HERGM86", "B00E5I2MDQ", "B006VRRGNK", "B002ZG99QS", "B00000JQB5", "B007REV4T8", "B00008G8M5", "B008Y1YK9Y", "B0002ZDVEU", "6305718954", "B001DTPZNY", "B005LAIGW8", "B001F7MSFM", "B001GCUNWQ", "B00A2H9P98", "B000RW3VDE", "B002O5M4T4", "B00005JA8B", "B005LAIIPS", "B005LAII44", "B00BEIYHO2", "B000GUJZ00", "B00005N5S5", "B002SJIO4A", "B000VWYJ86", "B004EPZ0BG", "B0049IHX2C", "B00AEBBAEK", "B00005JM5E", "B008JFUOWM", "B000FS9FCG", "B00005PJ6N", "B00979KQFO", "B00AEFXKUI", "B002K0WBXW", "B0042U94UQ", "B004EPYZUS", "B008JFUQZ2", "B0084IG8TM", "B001DJLD1M", "B008JFUS5A", "B00006HBUJ", "B000J103OI", "B00F84H73Q", "B0087ZG7NO", "B000U1ZV8K"], "bought_together": ["B00E5I2M6I", "B008JFUO72"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B008JFUO72", "B00E5I2M6I", "B001DHXT20", "B00E5I2MEK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 12121}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.99, "brand": "DOWNEY,ROBERT JR.", "asin": "B00005JPS8", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515wjJQt2nL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Iron Man (Ultimate 2 Disc Edition)"}
{"description": "Marriage is a huge step in any relationship and, with the divorce rate skyrocketing, some clergymen find it advisable to council prospective couples prior to the marriage ceremony. Reverend Frank (Robin Williams) takes his marriage preparation course to a whole new level, putting couples through a very unusual and grueling set of classes that cover everything from trust and communication to experiencing childbirth, meeting each other's needs in and out of bed, and group sessions on how to fight fairly. Happy couple Sadie Jones's (Mandy Moore) and Ben Murphy's (John Krasinski) perfect compatibility is tested to the limits with extraordinary (and hysterical) assignments like caring for twin baby robots that cry and poop without restraint while baby-sitting a friend's two young children and shopping for wedding china. Driving a car blindfolded while one's intended gives directions is no simple task either, but abstinence from sex and writing their own marriage vows may be the couple's most difficult homework assignments. Comedy reigns throughout the entire movie thanks to Robin Williams, his choir-boy assistant Josh Flitter (Nancy Drew) and the rest of the cast and laughing out loud is definitely a course requirement for viewers, but underneath the hilarity is a serious message about making marriage work.--Tami HoriuchiDVD featuresIncludes widescreen anamorphic and full-screen versionsAdditional scenes with optional director commentaryAsk Choir Boy: Choose which relationship/marital questions he answers", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00561BNI6", "B000OCZA04", "B000P0J08S", "B00104AYFQ", "B0000CDRVU", "B001TUZD8O", "B00005JN3W", "B000A343RI", "B00008WJD6", "B0015I2RT8", "B0034GK78W", "B002ZG989G", "B00003CXSM", "B001AKTZW8", "B003B3V0N4", "6304584210", "B004EPZ070", "B001BL96JI", "B00AEBB8NS", "B001OQCUZM", "B002ZG9968", "B000LC5B7O", "B00005JPSM", "B000Y7U93C", "B00005JG6N", "B001Y8DJVE", "B008R65XWO", "B003EYVXXC", "B000BKVQS4", "B0009OL7Z4", "B00AEBB9M8", "B000ELJAEM", "B002K0WBXW", "B000ICM5X0", "B000GB775E", "B000RETOGA", "B00005JN4H", "B00006FMUW", "B00386EZKE", "B002ZG97QK", "B00AEFY99O", "B0049TC88U", "B003Y5H524", "B0000DZ6N3", "B000MEYJHE", "B0021L8UOY", "B000E6EHE0", "B0038N9X3Q", "B00007976U", "B00AEFXWXI", "B00008VFCA", "B00005JN0Z", "B0038N9WKU", "B002SYAGNC", "B00007E2F5", "B00DMDE02Q", "B002ZG984Q", "B0015U0QVW", "B0012KJ0DK", "B004IK30PA", "B000YAA68C", "B0002OXRSG", "B002ZG97B0", "B0002I84N0", "B0007RT9M6", "B004SIP9X8", "B000099T4E", "B00006ZXSL", "B001CTA1UM", "B001C5LLQ4", "B000HCPS94", "B00164KYV4", "B000P0J0DS", "B004SIP7I0", "B00005JMXX", "B002ZG998G", "B0000897EG", "B000J4QW7W", "B00466HN7M", "B00AEBB8R4", "B003Y5H4ZW", "B002ZG98FU", "B005LAIIB2", "B000957O82", "B003UEYBPI", "B000EMGICS", "B00AEFYWQY", "B00029LO5E", "B002ZGW92E", "B0026BXHQ0", "B000VKL6T8", "B00HW3EZZE", "B005LAIGSM", "B000LC4Z8A", "B0010X5X4O", "B002ZG99UE", "B000E8N8H0", "B002U4UYZA", "B001HN69C2", "B004HO6I2E"], "bought_together": ["B000OCZA04"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0034GK78W", "B002ZG989G", "B00561BNI6", "B001Y8DJVE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 56082}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.99, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00005JPQE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51-wgdGowCL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "License to Wed"}
{"description": "The Dark Knightarrives with tremendous hype (best superhero movie ever? posthumous Oscar for Heath Ledger?), and incredibly, it lives up to all of it.  But calling it the best superhero movie ever seems like faint praise, since part of what makes the movie great--in addition to pitch-perfect casting, outstanding writing, and a compelling vision--is that it bypasses the normal fantasy element of the superhero genre and makes it all terrifyingly real.  Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) is Gotham City's new district attorney, charged with cleaning up the crime rings that have paralyzed the city. He enters an uneasy alliance with the young police lieutenant, Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman), and Batman (Christian Bale), the caped vigilante who seems to trust only Gordon--and whom only Gordon seems to trust. They make progress until a psychotic and deadly new player enters the game: the Joker (Heath Ledger), who offers the crime bosses a solution--kill the Batman. Further complicating matters is that Dent is now dating Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal, after Katie Holmes turned down the chance to reprise her role), the longtime love of Batman's alter ego, Bruce Wayne.In his last completed role before his tragic death, Ledger is fantastic as the Joker, a volcanic, truly frightening force of evil. And he sets the tone of the movie: the world is a dark, dangerous place where there are no easy choices.  Eckhart and Oldman also shine, but as good as Bale is, his character turns out rather bland in comparison (not uncommon for heroes facing more colorful villains). Director-cowriter Christopher Nolan (Memento) follows his critically acclaimedBatman Beginswith an even better sequel that sets itself apart from notable superhero movies likeSpider-Man 2andIron Manbecause of its sheer emotional impact and striking sense of realism--there are no suspension-of-disbelief superpowers here. At 152 minutes, it's a shade too long, and it's much too intense for kids. But for most movie fans--and not just superhero fans--The Dark Knightis a film for the ages.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B00DUCXFUC", "B004LWZWGK", "B000PC6A3E", "B002ZG981E", "B00G4RD4PQ", "B0039208QM", "B001GMALGY", "B00E2Y0YBK", "B00C2IGQBA", "B0039208JE", "B00H14WTLQ", "B0039208CG", "B0085D3I3K", "B0039208C6", "B000M5AJQI", "B00319ECGK", "B001FB55H6", "B00EIG5M5A", "7020070078", "B00E2Y6AUY", "B00D5FMGGS", "B001OQCV6K", "B0013FBS20", "B000Q6GX5Y", "B001GKJ2FC", "B00FPS79F6", "B001992NUQ", "B004JMSIRC", "B001RIY4WE", "B00DYEN6XC", "B008QZ5PY2", "B001F7MSG6", "B00FAHYNWE", "B00J7PRJXU", "B001AQT0Z4", "B001UV4XEW", "B0083SBJXS", "B00AEFY552", "B00C8RD79O", "B007KAJG3K", "B007L4HET8", "B004EPZ07U", "B007L4HFDI", "B00AEFXKOO", "B000PC0U1W", "B00C6B8TB8", "B00HINFI4K", "B003TT2X6I", "B001KZIRM2", "B002ZG99NG", "B00EZ4M68G", "B004SIP90G", "B003ZHR6RK", "B001GCUO16", "B003TT2X6S", "B00JNEWSLS", "B001F3FUK6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00DUCXFUC", "B004LWZWGK", "B002ZG981E", "B000PC6A3E"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "asin": "B00005JPY0", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51pGxSkkz4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Dark Knight [Theatrical Release]"}

{"description": "After an eight-year hiatus, George Romero makes his long-awaited cinematic return with the visceralBruiser, a savage and unsettling take on Kafka'sThe Metamorphosisas aDeath Wishrevenge fantasy.

He's the ultimate anonymous man, and he's mad as hell and not going to take it anymore. Painting his masklike visage like a tribal warrior, he hunts down and kills his tormentors. Romero takes an odd pleasure in Flemyng's perverse self-help campaign, as if his savage explosion is some form of primitive personal growth. Lacking the irony and complexity of Romero's best work (Dawn of the Dead,Martin),Bruiserturns into little more than a sophisticated revenge picture with inspired moments of black humor.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00KDU8HQQ", "B0013D8LAE", "0792841328", "B0014VPFVS", "B00J5LXTUI", "069220315X", "B00INLE540", "B00G5GNYY2", "B000MM0LEG", "B00EVU3RSW", "0792841336", "B000JLPMPS", "B00EF0NY7W", "B00A429Y9M", "B00008WFU5", "B00D7AM71A", "630512003X", "B009IV2Z3M", "B000RIWAV2", "B004XQO8LY", "0783227434", "B00DPUB56U", "B007PK9MTI", "B00GHH9IIA", "B0013D8L7M", "B00CPTUNZG", "B003JFCG82", "B00BSU0FQA", "B007XF0XUW", "B003Q7B79M", "B00009NHC0", "B00125WATQ", "1573625485", "B000059H96", "B00BTYPW7C", "B0009X768W", "B000HT38B2", "B00AWHDEM2", "B001152TL6", "B000GIXCM4", "B002LMSWN2", "B00344EAPK", "B000RIWAVW", "B000CFYAMC", "B000HWZ4N4", "B000WC38FU", "B006OEPRT0", "B000MV8ZDQ", "B0009RQRQU", "B000059H87", "B00006G8HR", "B000BC8T3C", "B0000AYLJF", "B000067J0H", "B008BWFOUU", "B000J10EQK", "B00B58943U"], "bought_together": ["B0013D8LAE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0061134104", "B0002F6AY8", "B0013D8LA4", "B00005JO16"]}, "price": 8.96, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 146250}, "asin": "B00005NQGM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51n%2BtySlGQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Bruiser"}

{"description": "These brief (30 minutes total), silly adventures use a few elements of Lewis Carroll's \"Alice\" stories as a premise. The title character has been transformed into a blond teenager in a sailor suit; all the other characters have been recast as curvaceous women in scanty costumes. The White Rabbit is a Playboy bunny, years after the last Playboy Club closed. The Cheshire Cat attempts to seduce Miyuki; the Queen of Hearts (who wears a dominatrix costume) cracks a whip and tries to make Miyuki kiss her boots. Of course, it's all a dream, but not a pleasant one. Western viewers may have trouble understanding why the all-female Clamp studio would make such a sophomoric example of fan-service sexism. Perhaps the material plays differently in Japan, but it's difficult to see how. Unrated; suitable for ages 17 and up: Brief nudity, violence, sexual situations, including lesbianism and sado-masochism.--Charles Solomon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00GRZPQR4", "B00CENSU3A", "B00GJ7CTSE", "B00ANDPGI0", "B005NQ5LM8", "B008YRL6V8", "B00E688XI8", "B001PSUM04", "1626920311", "B000R17RT4", "B001EL6E9U", "B00ANDBWXS", "B00ANDEL3Q", "B003UNG8H8", "B009RZ890M", "B00576U9LM", "B00ANDGYO0", "B009L0H4H2", "B00ANDPGFI", "B004SGWYW4", "159182303X", "1935934899", "B0048EAYQE", "B00CU6WBMW", "B000JJ4FA8", "1937867099", "B0006IIPNA", "B00008V2V3", "B00005CC78", "B00004Y9PV", "B00004T3BS", "B0030BOCFK", "B0000A1HOO", "B000087F31", "B0000ACP48", "B000056MW6", "B0000A9GLV", "B00006CY49", "B0032DA43U", "B00009MGFN", "B003TX8Q24", "B0000C3IBR", "B00B04KVOA", "B0014LXES4", "B00005O5AR", "B0002LE8XW", "B00151QYIA", "B0000844I7", "B001EL6EB8", "B00006JDSW", "B0000DZ3GU", "B00AIZ20SW", "B002MD2YWU", "B002FOQY36", "B000VKL6RU", "B002CWKTQE", "B007V2LN74"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0036EBALK", "B00B1LM758", "159182303X", "B0085A9JGI"]}, "price": 9.66, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 144857}, "asin": "B0000639E5", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51R9Y5HTHCL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Miyuki-Chan in Wonderland"}

{"description": "Toula is 30. And unmarried. Which means as a nice Greek girl -- she's a failure. All her cousins did the right thing -- married Greek boys and made Greek babies. So everyone worries: what will become of Toula? Then one day she sees the ultimate unattainable guy and realizes the only way her life will get better is if he gets away from her big, fat Greek family. Toula escapes from the family restaurant. She exchanges her seating hostess jacket for a college diploma, convinces her aunt to give her a new job, and trades in her coke-bottle glasses for contact lenses, just in time for \"him\" to walk back into her life.

{"description": "This lean, efficient horror flick stands well above most bloated  blockbusters.Dog Soldiersfollows a military squad on a training  mission in the Scottish wilds, where they run into a pack of werewolves.  There's nothing fancy about the plot--the soldiers hole up in a farmhouse  and desperately try to fend off the werewolves until dawn--but the script  is full of smart dialogue and clever ideas, the direction is dynamic, and  the performances (from Kevin McKidd, Sean Pertwee, Emma Cleasby, and Liam  Cunningham, among a solid cast of relative unknowns) are strong and  committed throughout.Dog Soldierspays homage toNight of the  Living Dead,Aliens, andThe Evil Dead, among other  films, but the references are woven into the fabric of the movie. An  unpretentious, tension-inducing flick like this is a pleasant reminder  that even crude special effects can be more evocative than expensive  computer flashiness.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000A2X3U2", "B000U1ZV7Q", "B001AR0D5Y", "B0024FADD8", "B00AEBB91E", "B0002I84DK", "B001221DUQ", "B0001EFV7M", "B000VSDNFA", "155890848X", "B000P0J056", "B00009OWI1", "B001GCUO0W", "B004P7CN3G", "B00AEFYXQI", "B00BMUL8QC", "B008OR5X4O", "B000IHY9TS", "B000NVT0TI", "B001MFNB4O", "6305090564", "B00195FUDC", "B0028DRGDQ", "B000G1ALDY", "B000099T3U", "B00006AUIG", "B000EOTVU2", "B00J5LXT6M", "B00008AOVO", "B002LMSWN2", "6305258287", "B0037E8HNI", "6305943133", "B00IORPR90", "B0051T47NQ", "B00023BM4S", "B0092U7JSU", "B0009X75J2", "B005CA4SEC", "B00GB0OR9S", "B001HVZO6Q", "B001B8XRT6", "B00BNAE14W", "B0015ET3YO", "B000BUNZY2", "0790751658", "B00125WATQ", "B00111YM5Q", "B00AEFXW8I", "B005TG8156", "B0002CHK1S", "B00406UK7S", "B0007WQHI0", "B00G5GNYY2", "B000067J0M", "B002TZS5G0", "B002OVO18A", "B0002W4SBI", "B004EI2NP4", "B000GYI3B8", "B008DL4LQ2", "B000GLL1U6", "B002NZK5U0", "B0007A0F4O", "B000PMLJMQ", "B003WTO5NO", "B002WJHBE0", "B000IJ79TS", "B000OYCMLM", "B003VMFWXO", "B00005KH30", "B00IYJRIKO", "B0009WFEDC", "B000VZADP6", "B002P7UCJK", "B000GI3RGK", "B000ARFPMQ", "B00IJS2OXG", "B000JJRYDS", "B000WC389G", "B0053TWW36", "B002GHHHL0", "B0036R92US", "B004GSVXA8", "B00BUNQPZK", "B008G33PIM", "B000AM6OQ2", "0783116926", "B00GOYC3I8", "B00A1AU72A", "B00008LUNW", "B00064X5L6", "B0021L8UXA", "B000CSTKGA", "B002VKB0KG", "B002FICQFM", "B00CERJI5U", "B000JU7JIW", "B00005RHGK", "B007XF0W3K"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0024FADD8", "B001GCUO0W", "B003MGSTFC", "B00009OWI1"]}, "price": 3.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 238320}, "asin": "B00006L91H", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51WAC7SFK9L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Dog Soldiers"}

His English is impeccable.Except for the omission of \"Canzone Arrabbiata,\" this PBS-televised concert  in the outdoor Theatre of the Earth in Thessalon&#xED;ki, Greece, duplicates the material on  theCD of the same name. In \"Nights in White Satin (Notte di Luce),\" he is  joined by Justin Hayward of the Moody Blues.  The video dimension adds a lot; Frangoulis has a magnetic stage presence,  and the vast audience is infectiously enthusiastic. He gives little spoken  introductions explaining each song, but English subtitles would have made  the DVD even more valuable.--Joe McLellan", "related": {"also_bought": ["B007HLUE6K", "B00006FRN6", "B00066459U", "B00CE0BJ4A", "B0055V0HDY", "B0031FK03S", "B00BCM2F3U", "B0048IZF0A", "B000JCEU50", "B000I2J6R8", "B009A87WMW", "B008NR8XKG", "B000KN7BRM", "B003UPPO2G", "B00CHRBAG2", "B000P0IW46", "B000GW8UFO", "B00008S2VE", "B00092ZMDY", "B0096MV73M", "B007146EEE", "B00EPFEY44", "B0010IIGKM", "034549458X", "B003H5780U", "B000BJ7CPG", "B00006RSTL", "B0000TCOZ0", "B001AAV3PA"], "bought_together": ["B00006FRN6", "B007HLUE6K"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B007HLUE6K", "B00006FRN6", "B00066459U", "B00FK3WC2Q"]}, "price": 11.98, "categories": [["CDs & Vinyl", "Pop", "Vocal Pop"], ["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 204804}, "asin": "B00007CVRQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51AD4DWB7ZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Mario Frangoulis - Sometimes I Dream (Live in Concert)"}

{"description": "It was a short but sweet fifth season forSex and the City, as HBO's resident comediennes found themselves affected by forces beyond their control--the pregnancies of both Sarah Jessica Parker (Carrie) and Cynthia Nixon (Miranda). A truncated shooting schedule to accommodate the actresses forced this season to be reduced to a mere eight episodes, and indeed, you can tell both actresses are expecting. (Carrie's wardrobe became more outlandish and more concealing than usual.) Still, the actresses and creators forged ahead, creating a handful of episodes that if short in content were long on emotion and laughs. Whereas the fourth season found all four grappling with various relationships, the fifth season focused on the perils of being single, with a new intensity lacking in the previous sexcapades. Carrie and Miranda wrestled with their solitary lifestyles, albeit with new attachments--Miranda had new baby Brady and single motherhood, while Carrie found herself in the world of publishing as the author of a real-life book of her columns. Charlotte (Kristin Davis) wondered if she'd ever find another man, while Samantha (Kim Cattrall) finally got rid of the one that had been vexing her far too much, hotelier Richard (James Remar). If the season as a whole felt less than the sum of its parts, those parts were some of the best comedy in the show's history, from Samantha's anointment as the \"Michiko Kakutani of vibrators\" to Carrie's stressful, one-degree-from-fiasco book launch party. (And fear not, Chris Noth's Mr. Big does pop up now and again.) The season's climactic episode, \"I Love a Charade,\" found all four at the straight wedding of a seemingly gay pal (Nathan Lane) and contemplating their future with a wry, bemused tone.

{"description": "Workplace dramas seem to have become a French specialty, and Jacques Audiard'sRead My Lips(\"Sur mes levres\") proves a worthy follow-up to such notable predecessors in the genre asHuman ResourcesandTime Out(\"L'Emploi du temps\"). The film also nods towards Neil LaBute'sIn the Company of Menand Hitchcock'sRear Window, but it's none the worse for that. Carla, our anti-heroine (Emmanuelle Devos), is an ugly duckling working as a secretary for a construction company in suburban Paris. Dowdy and all-but deaf, she's exploited and put upon by her male coworkers. When her boss lets her hire an assistant she bizarrely chooses Paul (Vincent Cassel), a scruffy and none-too-bright ex-con. But an odd symbiosis grows up between this pair of losers; the combination of his petty-criminal skills and her lip-reading abilities has certain potentials.AsA Self-Made Hero, his previous movie, showed, Audiard doesn't go in for lovable characters. Carla is no long-suffering saint and Paul is frankly sleazy, but this just makes their interaction all the more intriguing. Devos, glowering malevolently beneath her dark brows, and Cassel with his greasy hair and ratty moustache, turn in relishably truculent and un-starry performances, and Audiard deftly manages the transition from office comedy to gangland heist thriller with no grinding of gears. By the end the plot starts to strain belief, but it scarcely matters. The noir-ish lighting and potent use of hand-held close-ups enhance the film's sense of nervous unease, and there's ingenious use of sound to convey Carla's hearing-impaired world. Downbeat and unblinkingly amoral,Read My Lipsoffers pleasures that a glossier treatment would have missed entirely.--Philip Kemp", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000B9EYFW", "B002BWP3UC", "B0009S4J1E", "B0007WQHDU", "B00AZNEVNE", "B000TXNDSO", "B0002C4JIK", "B0000C9JFO", "B0002S64SM", "B000FWHW68", "B002BWP3UM", "B000296E7W", "B00HVOFP6W", "B0001IN0MQ", "1585103942", "1585104043", "B00009W0U4", "B000MTEFP0", "B0081HLM2E", "B002BWP4A6", "B00AZNEVJ8", "B0036TGSJE", "B000E33W0I", "B00AIBZLR8", "B000B9EYG6", "B000G0O5IM", "B0007Z0NYQ", "B00F6SHGF8", "B00HE010QM", "B0000A1HQP", "B00AX7PGQS", "B0057GYODG", "B00000F7E6", "B00005NB9Z", "B00166UFA2", "B003JDQJM8", "B0069UV0AY", "B00AQ6J6H6", "B00JJ3EHCG", "B000GBEWP2", "B00003CXXY", "B003Y5H4R0", "B000069CF9", "B002XUL6MG", "B0077E8RFC", "1567301452", "B000E5LEV0", "B00JVQ7QTM", "B00I4X8KU2", "B000AQKUG8", "B009B8YMB0", "B00HRJVHEK", "B00ANQHR7U", "B000I8OMEY", "B00ARX2VZW", "B000083C5F", "B004XVMCKS", "B000067J3P", "B00007CVS3", "0792838947", "B00F6Y3FT8", "B0001BKACG", "B000305ZYS", "B004ED52XE", "6305133476", "1585104051", "B0001US47U", "B0087OULO6", "0767837363", "B00004TBFR", "B004ITYDVG", "B001CC7PLM", "B001THZAAI", "B00008976W", "B00A92MGLA", "B000934FC2", "B000TR1SN2", "B002P7UCBI", "B000OCY7JE", "B0083V2W18", "B00HE011DE", "B00000JSJC", "B0007989Y8", "B004B3254Q", "B00GPPXP6A", "B00BC75HTE", "B00DHN8G08", "B005152C7S", "B0087IT8FK", "1572525983", "B005LLX582", "B000X4ZGSE", "B000H5U5R6", "B00DPUB59W", "B007UW9W32", "B00000IC7G", "B00AQ6J5YA", "B0002KQOH6", "B005E7SEK2", "B000GBEWNY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000B9EYFW", "B002BWP3UC", "B000FWHW68", "B0087IT8FK"]}, "price": 8.25, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 141637}, "asin": "B00009OOFG", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51PNK0TTDJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Read My Lips"}

The \"story\" proceeds to unwind in a series of single-take scenes that unfoldMemento-style, with each scene giving more context to what we have seen previously.  Each scenario depicts actions, dialogue, incident, behavior, and circumstances that the lead characters might have wished didn't happen, ranging from extreme violence through awkward social situations to mild embarrassment. The central character (and possible dreamer of this whole what-if story) emerges as Alex (Monica Bellucci), who suffers the worst in a very hard-to-watch rape sequence in an underpass. Semi-improvised, the scenes all have attack and power as themes, with later/earlier conversational sequences that suggest life isn't all sexual assaults in the dark, showing equal cinematic imagination with the horrors. Arguably, this is not a film most would subject themselves to twice, but it is something that stays in the mind for days after viewing, sparking far more ideas and emotions than most wallow-in-nastiness pictures.--Kim Newman", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005K9O8", "B001MEJY8W", "B00GGY4R3K", "B0048LPRCS", "B001B187L6", "B00125WATQ", "B00003CXXY", "B000FWHW68", "B0048LPRD2", "B002EOVXBK", "B000GI3RHY", "B0014VPFVS", "B003KGBISE", "B003VL3UR0", "B000WMEE9E", "B000WC38EQ", "B000L6S92E", "B0006JMLVQ", "B0082A3HFK", "B005ER6STG", "B00003JRAV", "B00375LBKI", "B001AZKB8K", "B00699G622", "B0040QYRT0", "B00006FDBW", "B0000CABGW", "B00GRZPRB4", "B004BLTNM0", "B000UW8596", "B0009WFEDC", "B004C00EM8", "B0007TZHWA", "B000ARFPMQ", "B005SQRYB4", "B003B2UK1S", "B006UGWDXU", "B00DMUFXOS", "B00JVQ7QTM", "6305228876", "B003L20IEM", "B0032D5ESA", "B00BSU0FQA", "B002EOVXCY", "B001JV5BIA", "B0060AAMEI", "B0000AQS1H", "B002R3CQDC", "B005IGVTM4", "B004LXBKEC", "B003KGBISO", "B00005JMIJ", "B000IMVE32", "B008G1JIQC", "B00006LPER", "B00005U14H", "B00699G6AE", "B001C5LLVE", "B0041KKYCY", "B0043X1FEU", "B00EOBB7LC", "B009OCR2U6", "B000HXDWNM", "B0002DB52M", "B001VG2MAI", "B002C8YSCE", "B0000BWVCR", "B00HW3EJ6Y", "B00AYGVCCK", "B000I8OMEY", "B00023P4I8", "B0009S2T0M", "B003Y5H5G0", "B00LLAV26O", "B00GPPXNIK", "B000X1RYEQ", "B00000IC7G", "B004XZ99FK", "B006Z7Z3VS", "B001PYD0LQ", "B00GPPXNQ2", "B004P2VQZ2", "B001FOK70S", "B00DI67YCU", "B00K0MM4AM", "B0009VRHLK", "B00006FMCS", "B000BGH29K", "B003L20IEC", "B000AC7P5Q", "B0002KPHZG", "B001AIQ14A", "B00APUAKYG", "B00AY6PK5A", "B00284BNKC", "B006OB3K56"], "bought_together": ["B001MEJY8W", "B00GGY4R3K"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001MEJY8W", "B00GGY4R3K", "B0048LPRCS", "B001B187L6"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 33569}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 10.13, "brand": "LION&#39;S GATE ENTERTAINMENT", "asin": "B00009W0U4", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41GBWP82KQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Irreversible"}

{"description": "When Neil Jordan is really on his game, as he is withThe Good Thief, his directorial skill is a marvel to behold. In the character-driven mode of Jordan'sMona LisaandThe Crying Game, this smooth, underrated caper provides an abundance of cinematic riches, not the least being Jordan's peerless knack for dialogue and a tailor-made role for Nick Nolte. For better or worse, Nolte's off-screen drug abuse served him well in portraying Bob Montagnet, ace thief, recovering heroin addict, and beloved denizen of the French Riviera, where his luck is about to take some very clever turns. The elegant plot is yours to discover: In loosely remaking the French classicBob le Flambeur, Jordan crafts what one reviewer aptly called \"the underbelly ofOcean's Eleven,\" involving an impenetrable vault full of priceless art, a rescued Russian prostitute, an eccentric band of accomplices, and high-stakes poker in Monte Carlo. Nolte's right at home in this rich-and-risky milieu, and the combined talents of Jordan and ace cinematographer Chris Menges makeThe Good Thiefa pleasure from start to finish.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005UQ9T", "B00004RFAJ", "B00HGBAG5K", "B00112S8RS", "B000BOH904", "B00D3LA5WG", "B000EHRVOM", "B00G7QPXUI", "B0009A40EI", "B00008K7AO", "B00D3DJIG8", "B00006L91I", "B004QDRW0S", "B0001EFV7C", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B00AENNHOE", "B00GBT62PQ", "B0002V7O5Q", "B00AN10MK4", "B009AMAL4Y", "B00008KC4I", "B00005JNQA", "B007UW9W5U", "B00004W229", "B00008972P", "0767847415", "B00DX88HME", "B0000633SC", "B000062XE6", "B00006RCNV", "B00008PHCU", "B00005U2KC", "B0045HCIZE", "B00AEBB89W", "B00H9KKGTO", "B004SIP7VM", "B004C45AZU", "B000C65Z1G", "B00000F527", "B0003JAO7C", "B00097DY2A", "B00008YNHD", "B000JYW5AK", "B004MQ6W5K", "B00049QJ9I", "B0001BKACG", "B00005OLYF", "B0095YMNGG", "B00AQBDU4Q", "B000053VAX", "B00005QCVU", "B004XQO90O", "B00005NRN8", "B008220DGE", "B002VWNICC", "B002ZG98C8", "B00005JMJ4", "B000PAAJZ6", "B001RTP3YQ", "B009POCG0Y", "B007L6VRBM", "B000063US2", "B002O3Z4Y8", "B000069HZP", "B00166UFTS", "B00AEFYSEA", "B00005JNC2", "6305657947", "B00B1E6FF8", "1572525983", "B000059PPK", "B000TXNDSO", "B000MG2LOA", "B00007M5HI", "B00026L754"], "bought_together": ["B00005UQ9T"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0385337469", "B00008KC4I"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 158740}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 15.21, "brand": "20th Century Fox", "asin": "B00009WVT3", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51P4Q33DNFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Good Thief"}

{"description": "It's appropriate for a Michael Bay-Jerry Bruckheimer film that theBad Boys IIDVD is a visual and aural spectacle.  The picture is bright and vivid, and the soundtrack explosive and muscular (even without a DTS option--maybe there'll be a Superbit later).  There's no Bay commentary track as he did for theoriginal film, but he does appear in the disc 2 featurettes on stunts and visual effects describing the use of real props (check out the \"car flipper\" apparatus), CGI, and camera positioning (\"The theory of this car chase is to put cameras where cameramen would be killed doing these shots.\").Also filling out disc 2 are the in-depth scene deconstructions, which take six key scenes and allow you to view the sequence as it appeared in the film (a convenient touch), watch on-set footage, see the storyboards, and read the script (yes, there was a script).  The 19 \"production diaries\" may sound like text notes, but they offer even more on-set footage and factoids.  The seven deleted scenes are all pretty short and none aren't watchable, but it's hard to imagine needing to add any extra time to this 147-minute film.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00004STUL", "B00164GDE6", "B00003CY5Y", "6304821832", "B000OT6V64", "0780631234", "B00005U5A8", "B000J4QWMC", "B0000A2ZU1", "B0000VAFO0", "B002CA68N4", "B00008WI9O", "B002AT8KA6", "B000WGYMTC", "B00003GPFT", "B002AS466O", "B00AEFXP8K", "B002CA68MU", "B000HDZKLO", "B00005A3KS", "B00005JLQT", "B00000G3PA", "B00005JLQN", "B000N4SHNK", "B00005JL3K", "B0049IHX2C", "B00005JMUA", "B001DJLD12", "B000085EFK", "B0045HCJG2", "B00005JLG1", "B00006RVJR", "B001KRVLCI", "0783225539", "155890834X", "B000VG66XS", "B000274T94", "B002GHHHME", "6304711891", "B000WQWPKA", "B00177YA1K", "B003ZD9E4W", "B00IKM5OYW", "B0007V6ITE", "B000WGYMT2", "B00005JKWJ", "B001CDR1FG", "B00005JKMQ", "B00026ZG10", "B0002B14UW", "B0041QSZS8", "B0015XHP2C", "B00AEFYE08", "B00003CXKD", "B000056BOW", "1558908390", "B001VLBDD0", "0790738953", "B00005JMEW", "6305428115", "B00005JPK8", "B00AEFXSEQ", "B001QB9H1U", "B00008MTYF", "B000U1ZV8K", "B004U7MR14", "0767802519", "B002NXSRVG", "B00AEFYO08", "B000069DOB", "0780627857", "B000XA5K48", "B00IS02HA0", "0790732149", "0780631684", "B00AEFY0XE", "B000F5WR4W", "B00005N5S5", "B000I2J736", "B00005JN0T", "B000VR0570", "B001OST0LW", "B00441GYXI", "B000HT38BM", "B00005JKCH", "B001OST0M6", "B00005JKCB", "B0013J55B6", "B0036BDQBU", "B000P0J06U", "B00008G8M4", "B000RW3VCK", "B00029RT9E", "B00005JM4Q", "B002VWNIEA", "0780627822", "B00005JD5H", "B002CA68NO", "B0001MMGC2", "B00003CXTA"], "bought_together": ["B00004STUL", "6304821832"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000VG66XS", "B00004STUL", "B00L4K450G", "B005LAIGRS"]}, "price": 14.94, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 69765}, "asin": "B0000DKDUR", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GXM3243YL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Bad Boys II (Two-Disc Special Edition)"}

{"description": "BetweenFriends' fifth and sixth seasons, Courteney Cox and David Arquette were married, leading to \"The One After Vegas\" adding \"Arquette\" after everyone's title credits. Unfortunately, on-screen it's divorce time again despite \"The One When Ross Hugs Rachel,\" since he secretly tries avoiding an annulment of their accidental marriage. Far more out in the open is Chandler (Matthew Perry) and Monica's (Cox) relationship. Moving in together creates lots of fun as the others move back and forth into each other's apartments. It also leads to Joey (Matt LeBlanc) finally showing a tender side toward temporary roommate Janine (Elle Macpherson). By now his chat-up catchphrase \"How you doin'?\" had caught on, but he needed to fall for someone. He kept the fun alive all year, pretending to have a Porsche, starting work on the showMac and C.H.E.E.S.E., and falling for Chandler's (Matthew Perry) card game Cups in the excellent \"The One with the Last Night\" (one of many directed by David Schwimmer).More fun came from Ross (Schwimmer) trying to teach everyone the mental discipline Unagi, popping ridiculous moves with Monica for their childhood dance routine and having a fluorescently dazzling smile in \"The One with Ross's Teeth\" (also featuring a near-silent cameo from Ralph Lauren). Far more talkative was Reese Witherspoon as Rachel's (Jennifer Aniston) sister--another temptation for Ross. What they briefly had wasn't as complicated as later in \"The One Where Ross Meets Elizabeth's Dad,\" who turns out to be an Emmy-winning Bruce Willis (thanks to having become friends with Perry duringThe Whole Nine Yards). The fans' need for love interest and continuity had established the seasons' format now. Another two-part finale offers jeopardy--then resolution--from Tom Selleck's Richard in \"The One with the Proposal\" between Chandler and Monica.--Paul Tonks", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0001AW066", "B0000C2IXN", "B003TNW03K", "B0006ZM8M2", "B003TNW04Y", "B0000844MI", "B003TNW03A", "B000068CNX", "B003TNW02G", "B005IA9JQI", "B005IA9JSG", "B005MG8UNG", "B005IA9JQ8", "B00020HAWY", "B005IA9JVI", "B000ERVK5S", "B00B1LKXPY", "B008LCRA98", "B008LCRABQ", "B008LCRAFC", "B008LCRAC0", "B0007R4SWC", "B008L0YMZA", "B0058JEHTS", "B00005JLEX", "B000A7PKGW", "B000NA1PUG", "B000EHSVN2", "B002BAW6I6", "B008KZX7W0", "B000EHSVM8", "B000U1ZV1W", "B0001907BW", "B00EQ2KU7G", "B0006FFRBG", "B002BAW6HW", "B000NOKFH6", "B000N6TYLW", "B001VPJYZ0", "B000HT3P7E", "B005SJGIV8", "B008LCRA7K", "B0002UE1WQ", "B000Q6GUW0", "B000640WGM", "B000G1R3A8", "B0019CSXAM", "B000GETTKM", "B0012BS5XU", "B000BNTM46", "B007C8RZQ0", "B000TM1CKQ", "B000AAF1U4", "B001DPHDBU", "B002Q5WHF8", "B00005JNEQ", "B000GRUMQY", "B000NJISIY", "B000GPIPTM", "B000EHSVMS", "B008JBJAM6", "B000AJJNI6", "B000F0UUTG", "B000EBGFPY", "B000P6YNSO", "B004GJYRFA", "B00005JO9J", "B00005JLFT", "B000G1R4SY", "B00005JOHC", "B0018CWEXK", "B000T22PVG", "B003YLM79E", "B000SINT4S", "B0024FAR6Q", "B000BOH990", "B0015ABRE2", "B001DJLD2G", "B003R0MF7G", "B002BWOYKC", "B000FL7CAK", "B0001ZMWXW", "B0001CCXZW", "B00000F5W8", "B001VPJZ0O", "B00FRILRL6", "B004GJYRA0", "B00004TJKK", "B002BJGYU8", "B001TKJDNA", "B00AMHFMOK", "B000V86OKG", "B00E5I2M6I", "B000QFCDAO", "B001FB4VZS", "B001RIZ7OI", "B00HEQOAIQ", "B0009OL7Z4", "B004EPZ0BG", "B003F3NE1Q"], "bought_together": ["B0001AW066", "B0000C2IXN"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003TNW04Y", "B005IA9JRM", "B0000C2IXN", "B0000844MI"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 51393}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 24.65, "brand": "Warner Bros", "asin": "B0000X2ECE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510SVY4JD9L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Friends: Season 6"}

{"description": "Based on the bestseller by John Grisham,Runaway Juryis a slick thriller that's exciting enough to overcome the gaps in its plot. The ultimate target has been changed: Grisham's legal assault on the tobacco industry was switched to the hot-button issue of gun control (no doubt to avoid comparison toThe Insider) in a riveting expos&#xE9; of jury-tampering. Gene Hackman plays the ultra-cynical, utterly unscrupulous pawn of the gun-makers, using an expert staff and advanced electronics to hand-pick a New Orleans jury that will return a favorable verdict; Dustin Hoffman (making his first screen appearance with real-life former roommate Hackman) defends the grieving widow of a gun-shooting victim with idealistic zeal, while maverick juror John Cusack and accomplice Rachel Weisz play both ends against the middle in a personal quest to hold gun-makers accountable. It's riveting stuff, even when it's obvious that Grisham and director Gary Fleder have glossed over any details that would unravel the plot's intricate design.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783226942", "B000P5FH3K", "B002NZK5R8", "B00AEFXYJA", "B002NZK5UU", "0767810872", "B002NZK5VO", "B0000694XY", "630542828X", "B00AEFXT1S", "B0006HBZBA", "B0045HCJ8K", "B0000C3I8M", "B004EPYZP8", "B0010YSD7W", "B00096S49Y", "B000063US3", "B000R4SMCW", "1558908382", "B001NY4WYC", "B003ASLJIQ", "6305428115", "B00005B6JZ", "B00005JL8F", "B00005UQ9T", "B00008EY9G", "B00008K77D", "0800141806", "B00005JPT0", "B00003CXFV", "B000P0I4O4", "B000CEV3M8", "B00441GYPG", "0790732149", "B000SFOW8I", "B000TJ6PBK", "0783240295", "B001I2EQUY", "B000055Y0Y", "B000NTMA0Q", "B002O3Z4ZW", "B002AT8KAG", "0790730979", "B00003CY5G", "B0038Z5T4Q", "B004SIP9RO", "B004YCKKFK", "B002AS464Q", "B00AMSM9DG", "0783226888", "B00AADAK5W", "B0031OCY2E", "B002DU39GW", "B00000K3TU", "B002LMV7R0", "B0013D8LBS", "B000GFLKF8", "B000CEXEWA", "B00008L3S6", "B00005ATZT", "B00AEBB9UK", "6304806434", "B002AT8K9W", "B00AEFXEGS", "B003ASLJQ8", "B0043X1FNQ", "B000BNX3B4", "B001CC7PLM", "B002QW7AMG", "B000JYW5BE", "B000Y11B8U", "B001HVZOB6", "B00BLN4UKQ", "B005NKIPUY", "B00015YVDG", "B00H91LWDC", "0792844874", "6305657947", "B003L20IG0", "0780618548", "B00DWZHTOU", "B003Q6D2B4", "B000ENC5YW", "B00GUO2SKA", "B0010YVCB6", "B00009WVSL", "B000G5SILC", "B000F8DV1M", "B00FQRZ6EM", "B000OYAT3U", "B00AEFXIIW", "B008JFURII", "B00005JNQA", "B002O3Z4XY", "B000059XTK", "B00005JN5E", "B001ECDVK4", "B000K7VHQ4", "B00000JGHL"], "bought_together": ["B000P5FH3K", "0783226942"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001I2EQUY", "B000P5FH3K", "B00AEFXYJA", "B002NZK5VO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 38867}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.67, "brand": "Twentieth Century Fox", "asin": "B00014NEZI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51X52Z0CBSL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Runaway Jury (Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "THE COMPANY is \"a completely new kind of film\" raves Anna Kisselgoff of The New York Times, a fascinating look at the world of dance, with the cooperation of the Joffrey Ballet of Chicago.  Legendarydirector and Oscar(r) nominee Robert Altman (2001 Best Director, Best Picture, Gosford Park; 1975 Best Director, Best Picture, Nashville), takes us into the world of the dancers whose professional and personal lives clash as they cope with the demands of a life in the ballet.  Neve Campbell (Scream, TV's \"Party of Five\") plays a gifted but conflicted company member on the verge of becoming a principal dancer at a fictional Chicago troupe.  Golden Globe(r) winner James Franco (Spider-Man, TV's \"James Dean\") co-stars as Campbell's boyfriend, a master chef who provides romance and refuge from the watchful eye of the pompous artistic director played by Malcolm McDowell (A Clockwork Orange).", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0007TKORI", "B008LC8RKE", "B00004XPPD", "B0025Z4Q4E", "B0019OP0GU", "B001CK7OMO", "B0071BY1HE", "B004WJT5G0", "B001K2LFNI", "B000GDH9JQ", "B0000694XY", "B0006GQMBY", "B002NULDSS", "B0006Q9482", "B007TBM9ZW", "1451591659", "B00KGLS050", "B00CYLZC4M", "B0001EQHYI", "B008NNY8TK", "B0000AZT67", "B005CM1IOI", "B0001AW0UW", "B006FMK4KS", "B00019G8BA", "B00AMEZDJW", "B002NN7EYW", "B00000IQCA", "B00I4CWIVU", "B000RO6K76", "B000059TFT", "B000E6ESWQ", "0805033025", "0425135004", "B00006FDCQ", "B000J3OTSM", "0486218430", "B00F98FOI6", "B003ICZW8M", "B0009ML2UG", "B003XTOBU0", "0670843709", "B000MTFFPO", "B00AEFXZ1C", "B00JAGF9Y2", "0767023447", "B000JJSJA0", "B000FA577G", "B00CLUME24", "B000G5SIBM", "0060750707", "B006MHZ7ZS", "B004SEUJXM", "B000BB1MGO", "B00096S3YA", "0736081933", "B00008AOR4", "1468144316", "B0001CNRS4", "B000294T5G", "1476737983", "B0001Z3HWC", "0670026492", "0813025931", "B000FUTVLY", "B00005JNIU", "0688015395", "B004FQX59S", "B00006JU8B", "B001CW802A", "B003M8NGFI", "B00008AORE", "B000F3UAFC", "B00005JKNF", "B007TBJUVS", "B0000CERP4", "B000063K2Q", "B00009V7RV", "B002ONC9NC", "B0009X7BHI", "B006WN5W9S", "0761171703", "B00004W19A", "B0037Z2JG8", "B000ADS6DA", "0767812387", "B000H6SXYM", "0813027055", "B00009MEKN", "B00329PYHK", "B000MEYJHO", "B00AKGG8GO", "0813009456", "B001PSVHNK", "0486220362", "B0007TFICE", "B003XURDAY", "B000AYEI9A", "B00D5XC8MC"], "bought_together": ["B008LC8RKE", "B0007TKORI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B008LC8RKE", "B00004XPPD", "B001CK7OMO", "B0007TKORI"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 96751}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 25.0, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B0001XAOPM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HGHCWDCNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Company"}
{"description": "A devastatingly skillful and emotionally compelling documentary,The  Times of Harvey Milkcharts the political rise and brutal slaying of  the first openly gay city official in the United State, Harvey Milk.  Ironically, the same election that brought Milk to the board of city  supervisors of San Francisco also elected the man who killed him, a former  police officer and fireman named Dan White. After White shot both Mayor  George Moscone and Milk, his defense lawyers convinced the jury that  White's judgment was impaired by depression and junk food, resulting in a  conviction for manslaughter instead of murder--a verdict that prompted  riots. With care and conviction,The Times of Harvey Milkcaptures  not only Milk himself, but also the political and social landscape in  which these events took place. The interviews--with friends, politicians,  and journalists--are articulate and heartfelt, expressing the impact that  Milk had upon this historical moment.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001QUF3SW", "B004AR4W4O", "B006QVRVW2", "B00A92MGLA", "0312560850", "B007C95S9K", "B001CQONPE", "B003IG06PM", "B003BR8ME0", "B0001Y4LDM", "B003LR5BBC", "B0007SL31U", "B00005AWR9", "B0001HAGRE", "B000E5LEVU", "B000YHQNCI", "0982565054", "B001FB55KI", "B00005KHJX", "B00005AQMJ", "B00114XLZA", "0800141806", "B0007WFYBG", "B0027BOL4Q", "B000067D0Y", "B0001L3LUE", "B00I4CWIVU", "0847843068", "B003E74KRK", "B0001I2BUI", "B00094AS72", "B00008UALE", "B0083V2VYG", "B0001US7TU", "0807755249", "B008MIYKLW", "B000053VAW", "B004AR4VRW", "B00IXD2N1K", "B00GMM19ZA", "B003H05VUY", "B00003CWN3", "B007N5YJPC", "B0006J286O", "B001NY4X1Y", "B00BD5GGI6", "B009RWRINE", "6305779619", "B00GHP8SH4", "B009NI2XN2", "B00EU8RB14", "B00D3LA7H4", "B00009ME9Z", "B000TXP56M", "B0009298P2", "0792838300", "B00GSBMNOQ", "B000053V7G", "B00IWULQQ2", "B005S9EIGU", "B00AQ6J56S", "B00D2UMHIS", "B00996RSYM", "B0001HAGSI", "B00008DDVV", "B000BZISX0", "B005KQVE1S", "B001E5FYS8", "B000089725", "B009NYF2GQ", "B00000CQJZ", "0792843983", "B00005O06N", "B00009YXAS", "0520262506", "0393062082", "B0002KQNKE", "B00GUO2SKA", "B000ZM1MGE", "B00005YUP1", "0312200250", "B00CUKTHES", "B000CRR3I8", "B00393SG3S", "B000TXNDV6", "B000O76PXK", "B007UW9W5U", "B0000560PU", "B0009PW3QK", "B001HBVE88", "B00E849QSG", "B001EOQCMG", "B004OOL73W", "B000E3LGTC", "0792833287", "B00005JOFQ", "B00CMQIDKY", "B006TTC5A4", "B0000VD04M", "B0000648XV"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001QUF3SW", "B004AR4W4O", "0312560850", "B00005AQMJ"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 163109}, "asin": "B0001Y4LDW", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5112V3EVZJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Times of Harvey Milk (20th Anniversary Collector's Edition)"}

{"description": "Cyndi Lauper may talk like Edith Bunker (or any number of other queens from Queens), but she sure doesn't sing like her. Indeed, two decades after she burst on the pop scene with herShe's So Unusualalbum, Lauper's voice is arguably stronger than ever--an opinion borne out inLive... At Last, a 16-song, 112-minute concert recorded in New York in March, 2004 (the title references both her'03 CD of the same nameand the fact that this is her first concert video since 1987'sCyndi Lauper in Paris). Unlike, say, such understated chanteuses as Norah Jones and Diana Krall, Lauper likes to wail, and if the result is occasionally somewhat over the top, it still makes for powerful performances of such familiar material as \"I Drove All Night,\" \"All Through the Night,\" and her biggest hits, \"Time After Time\" and the salsa-flavored \"Girls Just Want to Have Fun.\" Indeed, Lauper is at her best when she simply rocks (the punkish \"It's Hard to Be Me\" is another highlight). Far less successful are the mannered, ponderous, and/or melodramatic arrangements of pop standards like \"Walk On By,\" \"If You Go Away,\" and \"Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood,\" while the French caf&#xE9; vibe on \"She Bop\" is cute but insubstantial. The visuals (shot in high definition and viewed in widescreen) and audio are excellent, while bonus features include Lauper's guided tour of Queens.--Sam Graham", "related": {"also_bought": ["B005ISRAEI", "B0000028CD", "143914785X", "B00452J51E", "B00009V7PJ", "B003HTPHSQ", "B00008PX8X", "B00452J5AU", "B0046QK9TQ", "B001RTP436", "B00064VR0W", "B0012GMWNO", "B0028R3G5O", "B001725ZB4", "B0017WI5JI", "B0000A02WV", "B000BU0C70", "B0000E2FLC", "B00K0HDE7Y", "B007OAAK0O", "B00005QBZD", "B000021Y7Q", "B003XMKMZU", "B0001ENXYA", "B00JPXAO5E", "B003UPPO2G", "B00FTGYNUS", "B00008H2I9", "B0000584ZV", "B0002CTSY0", "B001Y7SIOI", "B00J0LH0XK", "630463949X", "B00023P4B0", "B00005RT35", "B000F48D00", "B0001Z3632", "B0000DG7C0", "B00HNTUR6S", "B00005R1NY", "B0053TWVFA", "B009DT9ANW", "B004Z1HYAE", "B000F8O49A", "B007KLEHUQ", "B0000AVHDC", "B0003035CW", "B0000071IP", "B0002IQI2Y", "B00FEXL3OA", "6305603898", "B002PLALCO", "B006T8KT5S", "B0000TB03W", "B002ZFQD04", "B0030BOCE6", "B003BUAOZ2", "B009DH372Y", "B0000028QO", "B0007Z0VVQ", "6304498977", "B000YEUUCK", "6305019681", "B000BC8STM", "B0000C2IUI", "B000NL51D2", "157330039X", "B00AU15GLC", "B000B5Y0JG", "B000BHHVPO", "B00064AEOC", "B000001E0D", "B000056HOZ", "B005SV9X22", "B00I5NKPWC", "B008B3MZMY", "B000KGGLCU", "B000FGG738", "B00008HCB8", "B004GJYR8W", "B000BVNY3S", "B00DZILTZO", "B006T8KT3U", "B00005V1WV", "B002LMOAUQ", "B000I0QLUA", "B003ICWTR4", "B000NA223K", "B000VKL6UW", "B000A2RRF4", "B000UX6TRK", "B000H7JCI2", "B0002GTX8M", "B00068C7VQ", "B00067BBQO", "B00BRN2RVE", "B000V7FZ7K", "B000CRSDM8", "B0018M6J72", "B00CIOG15E"], "bought_together": ["B005ISRAEI", "B0000028CD"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00452J51E", "B0028R3G5O", "B005ISRAEI", "B0000028CD"]}, "price": 13.75, "categories": [["CDs & Vinyl", "Alternative Rock", "New Wave & Post-Punk", "New Wave"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Pop", "Vocal Pop"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Rock"], ["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 124554}, "asin": "B00023BJFU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41P5FXCHC0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Cyndi Lauper - Live...

{"description": "Having scored a critical triumph withMean Streets, Martin Scorsese acceptedAlice Doesn't Live Here Anymoreas his first big-studio assignment, proving his versatility and further advancing his promising career. Hot offThe Exorcistwith her choice of projects at Warner Brothers, Ellen Burstyn sought a hot young talent (Scorsese was recommended by Francis Coppola) to direct Robert Getchell's fine, sensitive screenplay about Alice Wyatt, a newly-widowed 35-year-old lounge singer with a bratty 12-year-old son (Alfred Lutter) and a very uncertain future. Her pursuit of broken dreams lands her a waitressing job in an Arizona diner, where she befriends foul-mouthed Flo (Diane Ladd) and meets and falls in love with a divorced farmer (Kris Kristofferson).  With absolute authenticity of emotion and incident,Alice--which earned Burstyn a well-deserved Oscar&#xAE; and features supporting roles for futureTaxi Drivercostars Jodie Foster and Harvey Keitel--conveys a then-timely sense of strength and endurance from a single mother in desperate times. There have been several similar dramas made since 1974, butAlice(which inspired the popular TV sitcomsAliceandFlo) is still the best. Trivia buffs: Look closely for Ladd's daughter--a very young Laura Dern--and Scorsese as background extras in the diner scenes.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0033PSHDG", "B000WC39ZY", "B00006RCNV", "B004499LWG", "6305090580", "B00005U2K5", "B00BTYU3SK", "B0001CNRBG", "B001EKP5D2", "B004VJJF34", "B003O7I6SE", "B009TTGLJ2", "B00G3BRC24", "B0045HCJ76", "B00BWQU0RY", "6305941122", "B00GC2KI2U", "B0089BSLKS", "B00441GYRE", "B0012TIWTY", "B00KJFZZLU", "B0009WIE16", "B008FYZHHE", "B0007ZEOPK", "B00005JKGX", "B001KP2J6W", "B000059HAN", "6305882592", "B00441GYRO", "B000FDFFTS", "B008Y5OWSO", "B00HRISNPM", "6305999872", "6304907729", "B0000JBALO", "B0001US78G", "B000ZM1MG4", "B00005Q4CS", "B00CPTUOI2", "B00GSBMNOQ", "B0007XG4ZK", "B003VA3JTA", "B00HQI811Y", "B000OY8NFG", "B003V4JU1W", "B001VC99HQ", "B00DW5IKW0", "B00I4X8KU2", "B000G6BLY2", "B00000JZBX"], "bought_together": ["B0033PSHDG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0033PSHDG", "B00006RCNV", "6305882592", "B000WC39ZY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 53037}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.0, "brand": "Alice", "asin": "B000286RO8", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51JRZQAKWXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore"}

{"description": "After one episode ofThe Wireyou'll be hooked. After three, you'll be astonished by the precision of its storytelling. After viewing all 13 episodes of the HBO series' remarkable first season, you'll be cheering a bona-fide American masterpiece. Series creator David Simon was a veteran crime reporter fromThe Baltimore Sunwho cowrote thebookthat inspired TV'sHomicide, and cowriter Ed Burns was a Baltimore cop, lending impeccable street-cred to an inner-city Baltimore saga (and companion piece toThe Corner) that Simon aptly describes as \"a visual novel\" and \"a treatise on institutions and individuals\" as opposed to a conventional good-vs.-evil police procedural. Owing a creative debt to the novels of Richard Price (especiallyClockers), the series opens as maverick Detective Jimmy McNulty (Dominic West, in a star-making role) is tapping into a vast network of drugs and death around southwest Baltimore's deteriorating housing projects. With a mandate to get results ASAP, a haphazard team is assembled to join McNulty's increasingly complex investigation, built upon countless hours of electronic surveillance.The show's split-perspective plotting is so richly layered, so breathtakingly authentic and based on finely drawn characters brought to life by a perfect ensemble cast, that it defies concise description. Simon, Burns, and their cowriters control every intricate aspect of the unfolding epic; directors are top-drawer (including Clark Johnson, helmer ofThe Shield's finest episodes), but they are servants to the story, resulting in a TV series like no other: unpredictable, complicated, and demanding the viewer's rapt attention,The Wireis \"an angry show\" (in Simon's words) that refuses to comfort with easy answers to deep-rooted societal problems. Moral gray zones proliferate in a universe where ruthless killers have a logical code, and where the cops are just as ambiguous as their targets. That ambiguity extends to the ending as well; season 1 leaves several issues unresolved, leaving you begging for the even more impressive developments that await in season 2.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0006IUD9Y", "B000FTCLSU", "B000QXDJLI", "B00123BY6S", "B004YOEDR4", "B00316DDYA", "B00005Y6YJ", "B00003CXOP", "B003Y5HWJU", "B001DJLCRC", "B005SEDI5M", "B00BC5I6Q2", "B00J5LXT44", "B0000Y40PW", "B00HUCF420", "B00000FBH2", "B0060MYKYY", "B0012CJQY6", "B00EEDNR9A", "B002AMUDK8", "B001RTSPVY", "0802144993", "B00HW3EXCE", "B0058YPG1G", "B00BVMXBDO", "B00031TYBC", "B00KHWSD1O", "B00FCOTRV2", "B001DW2BFQ", "B0032UYFA6", "B00HGE90Z4", "B000G1R4TS", "B00ECGHM5O", "B0055CP9UY", "B0012CJQYG", "B000NA1VI2", "B0038M2APA", "B0012CJQYQ", "B009LDCZ7I", "B0009GV9E6", "B0060MYM3S", "B0009K7RMA", "B00FEP9MYG", "B0015TX2LO", "B0011VJRVU", "B00ECHBSP8", "B0047H7QD6", "B00B5J6A7W", "B0020TS5EM", "B009VXVMAO", "B004YM6JVO", "B00C8CQRQ4", "B00HUCF7AO", "B001IBIDLI", "B000BO7DWI", "B000KLQUUS", "B004TJ1GY2", "B00FGEO9NE", "B00DJYJRHG", "B0019LY5IM", "B008CLI4N4", "B00I9MS86O", "B00C888LOO", "B00007KLE8", "B0094UOI64", "B004X1VUNI", "B001AQO3WY", "B00DNR3FN6", "B0038M2AQ4", "B002BLNGTS", "B004132HZS", "B00BNH9NCU", "B00BGI076M", "B00BUUAV08", "B00HOGBXS6", "B004HW7JO2", "B00BTRKMNI", "B00BC5FN2C", "B00000I73E", "B000FP2OPY", "B002CPMB9O", "B00CWIMVDW", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B000YABIQ6", "B005DVIOIG", "B00EIXWW2O", "B00HUCF6KK", "B0007YMVWO", "B00G4Q3KOC", "B00DW5IKN4", "B00AB55BS0", "B000P0J09M", "B001IBIHQ4", "B00AEFYG3S", "B001GCUER0", "B003EYVXTG", "B00005JNOG", "B000MGBSE4", "B00H7LJ2UO", "B00CDTSFF8"], "bought_together": ["B0006IUD9Y", "B000FTCLSU"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005NFJAWG", "B0006IUD9Y", "B00BC5I6Q2", "B001DJLCRC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 3788}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 22.99, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B0002ERXC2", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/511fyhhxpWL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Wire: Season 1"}
{"description": "Unlike the Brady Bunch, the Camdens ofSeventh Heavenaren't a blended family. And unlike the Partridge Family, they aren't a band. They're just a family--a large, if normal family with normal problems and concerns. A little like the Waltons, perhaps, but set in the present day. The parents are Eric (Stephen Collins fromAll the President's Men), a minister, and Annie (Catherine Hicks fromStar Trek IV: The Voyage Home), a homemaker. They live in the suburbs of Glenoak, California, with their five children: 16-year-old Matt (Barry Watson), 14-year-old Mary (Jessica Biel), 12-year-old Lucy (Beverley Mitchell), 9-year-old Simon (David Gallagher), and 5-year-old Ruthie (Mackenzie Rosman). By the end of the pilot (\"Anything You Want\"), they'll add the dog Happy to their household.Created by Barbara Hampton (Blossom) and produced by Aaron Spelling (Beverly Hills 90210),Seventh Heavenpremiered on the WB in 1996 and would become its most enduring hit. It may lack a gimmick, but this heartwarming family drama doesn't lack a theme: communication. And since the Camdensarea minister's family, faith comes up often, as well, which gives the show something in common with such otherwise disparate programs asTouched by an AngelandJoan of Arcadia. Throughout 1996-1997, the Camdens would deal with many tough issues, both internal and external, including teen pregnancy (\"Family Secrets\"), death (\"In the Blink of an Eye\"), racism (\"The Color of God\"), spousal abuse (\"What Will People Say\"), and alcoholism (\"Last Call for Aunt Julie\"). In the years to come, the cast would have their own real-life issues with which to contend, such as Watson's battle with cancer (after taking 2003 off to recover, he would return in 2004) and the gradual loss of Biel (The Texas Chainsaw Massacre) to the movies.--Kathleen C.

Still, the gags come fast and furious, so for there's undoubtedly something to laugh at amidst the bathroom and ethnic jibes.--Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00006HAYO", "B000063RQO", "B000071ZZJ", "B00007ELEO", "B004P7CMZ0", "6304821832", "B00005LB86", "B00E1HIXA2", "B00003CY51", "B0000AGQ6T", "6305505780", "B00177YFYM", "B000UNYJWM", "630592273X", "B0002B14UW", "B00005UQ9I", "B00AEFYE08", "B000069DOB", "B002GHHK3U", "B00BLN4V46", "B00BTYPWDQ", "B00AEBB9AA", "B00000JGHV", "B0001Q4BOE", "B00003GPFT", "B000FS9ULC", "B001DJLD12", "B00008WI9O", "B00003W8NT", "B002CA68N4", "B000NA21SG", "B0034G4P1C", "B002C7ELWC", "B00007BK2T", "B00HX0KIAM", "B00004TJMW", "0780627822", "B00066FAQW", "B000274T94", "B00AEFYQWO", "B0002VYOVI", "1558908390", "B00005RIX5", "B0000TWMTS", "B000HDZKLO", "B001KKU9DM", "0780631234", "B0000TWMWK", "155890834X", "B00005JLG1", "0783237367", "B00J11U57C", "B000JBXHQY", "B000F4RH84", "B00H47IX5G", "B00EC6VVXI", "B00006LPH6", "6305120013", "B00005JLQT", "B005LAIH86", "0767813901", "B000060MWA", "B00005JPK8", "B00005JK8N", "B000056BOW", "B00BEL4QFO", "B000069HQ2", "B0000JBUHI", "B00007ELEN", "0783240201", "B00AEFXP8K", "B001DJLCQS", "B002ZG99RW", "B00068WOH8", "B002CA68NO", "B005SHBO1Y", "B0009X7BFK", "B0009K7RMA", "B000035Z3G", "B00AEFYAC0", "B0010NXURQ", "B00005JH9O", "B000BITV9W", "B0001FR3HW", "B00BLN4V5A", "B004SIP93S", "B00E1HIX66", "B002GSXKO2", "0767821955", "B000056N8Q", "B000TLOMPE", "B00008977B", "0783230524", "B002CAWNEM", "B000051YMS", "B0009P42RS", "B000BTITFI", "B007VYEE0A", "B00GOZ2LPM", "B002FOFX9M"], "bought_together": ["B00006HAYO", "B000063RQO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000063RQO", "B00006HAYO", "B000071ZZJ", "1558908390"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 33996}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.5, "brand": "Arnold", "asin": "B0002J4YVK", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51TFP9D4WCL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Soul Plane (Unrated Mile High Edition)"}

{"description": "Based on a comic book, the international co-productionRenegade(original English-language title:Blueberry) is a feverish, supernatural Western about a young Cajun man, Mike Blueberry (Hugh O'Connor), who defends his prostitute-girlfriend against gunman Wallace Blount (Michael Madsen) and ends up barely alive. Patched up by Indians, Blueberry undergoes the familiar cultural transformation to honorary Native American, then returns to his world to become a small-town marshal. (Vincent Cassel plays the adult Blueberry.) The arrival of Blount, possessed with otherworldly powers and seeking a mystical manuscript, sets the stage for a spooky duel that forces Blueberry to face old demons. The latter part of the film is overtaken by computer-generated effects that grow wearying, but before that director Jan Kounen makes up for weak narrative skills with mesmerizing imagery of the American Southwest.

Along with \"Dream On,\" \"Back in the Saddle,\" \"Walk This Way,\" \"Sweet Emotion,\" and other classic rock faves, a good portion of the show (as well as a 30-minute bonus documentary) is devoted toHonkin' on Bobo, their 2004 blues/roots CD. But unlike the Stones or the Yardbirds (another obvious Aerosmith inspiration), whose blues and R&B; covers formed the bulk of their early output, Aerosmith waited until late in their career to record chestnuts like \"Baby, Please Don't Go\" and \"Stop Messin' Around,\" and their versions owe much more to the rockers who performed these tunes in the '60s (Van Morrison and Ted Nugent for the former, and Peter Green-era Fleetwood Mac for the latter) than to the bluesmen who wrote them. No surprise there--Aerosmith, too, is at heart no more or less than a no-frills, hard-rocking band. That's exactly what their fans want, and it's hard to imagine that any of them will be less than thrilled withYou Gotta Move. The generous extra material includes five songs not aired in the original broadcast, the documentary mentioned above, and an audio CD of six songs from the show.--Sam Graham", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00D5YNQWM", "1573300470", "0760341060", "B00D5YNQMW", "B000286S9C", "B001LEK6US", "B0000E2FLC", "B0054YH9D8", "B00005QEO0", "B0091JJ1IS", "B0018M6J72", "B0085RQLXK", "B0000029AW", "B001BP4UBI", "B00005QEO1", "B000E0OEVW", "B00K0HDE3I", "B000000OY5", "B0000DJZB4", "B00006FN89", "B0053TWVFA", "B0000DJZAX", "B004D2GMR6", "B00092ZMDY", "B00005QENZ", "B00JPXAOW2", "B000LW7Z4G", "B0000TGADW", "B0000DJZB9", "B0012GMY28", "B004QPOVF0", "B000F8O49A", "0060515805", "B00FKIB3XA", "B000KJU1MS", "B0014YVCBC", "B00005QBZD", "B00008PX8P", "B00064VR0W", "0061767891", "B0000029AL", "B001KY47TU", "B00000DF8I", "B0013K1ALE", "B0012GMVBC", "B000V7B90C", "B0082SIPXQ", "B009E3EY38", "B000UYT9EY", "B001CCKJ2E", "B00023P4B0", "B008B3MZMY", "B004USUP12", "B000HEZF2M", "B0000029AN", "B000056HOZ", "B000BC8TBO", "B004J88SGC", "B0012GMYNC", "B000024E6T", "B00E5N8E6K", "157330056X", "630463949X", "B00EUEWQ2W", "B0006M83II", "B0002SPPSC", "B0012GMUNQ", "B00001ODGR", "B006EMSO74", "B003W5C0VW", "B0000029AS", "B003UPPO2G", "B0001MDQ44", "B000SSV8HI", "B002MWHYKI", "B00005QEO2", "B0000029AP", "B000CPH9XY", "B000WUK1T8", "B001L51RQE", "B002CJXI0Q", "B001F9FHF8", "B0050JN7Z6", "0783233485", "B000B5Y0KK", "B000AA4H1S", "B0016FWLAA", "B000A2XCIU", "B009DH372Y", "B0012YYZYK", "B00005JGTV", "B00FWSWQX4", "B003LS3PIC", "6305019681", "1573306983", "B000FG65SU", "B0043E8Y1Q", "B0000029B0", "B0017VG654", "0061767913"], "bought_together": ["1573300470", "B00D5YNQWM"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00D5YNQWM", "1573300470", "B0050JN7Z6", "B00FLDG52I"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 105873}, "categories": [["CDs & Vinyl", "Classic Rock", "Album-Oriented Rock (AOR)"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Classic Rock", "Arena Rock"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Metal", "Pop Metal"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Rock"], ["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 10.15, "brand": "", "asin": "B000654ZJ6", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/419B9GRZT3L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Aerosmith: You Gotta Move (DVD +CD)"}

{"description": "Director Irwin Winkler weighs in on two commentary tracks, one with Kevin Kline and one with writer Jay Cocks.  Both tracks are thoughtful and filled with details about Cole Porter's life, how the pop singers joined the film, and how their numbers were conceived. As might be expected, a lot of stories are repeated, but they're good stories, such as how \"Be a Clown\" was ripped off forSingin' in the Rain's \"Make 'Em Laugh.\" There's a very good 25-minute making-of featurette, plus a 15-minute music featurette that mixes clips and performances from the film with brief comments by the pop artists performing them (the Broadway re-creations are only mentioned in passing).  Two other featurettes go behind the scenes of two numbers, and the eight deleted scenes include Kevin Kline's short performance of \"You Do Something to Me.\"  Because the musical numbers have the most replay value, it's convenient that they're listed on the scene-selection menu.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000294SIE", "B00023GGHQ", "B0001WTWXS", "B000294QX6", "B0012GMVH6", "B00094ARN2", "0679727922", "B0000047BH", "B006AC9H92", "6305127670", "B004H0M2X2", "B00005B15A", "B00005IA7Y", "B001DE29SS", "B005MYEQ4U", "B000EBD9SA", "B00GPWEPZ8", "6305161879", "B00008G7UF", "B00000DRCN", "B0000ARD7O", "B00003CX8N", "B000PAAK5A", "B008FYZHZ6", "B0088X7Z6S", "0394582357", "B00008NFR4", "B00005YUPC", "B00FZRP8FU", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B000EWBKMG", "B000F7CEC0", "B0007939MK", "B0000C23T2", "B000056HEA", "0739069640", "B00083FZFE", "B00DL48BM6", "B00AMSQBSU", "B0012OX7DA", "B0059XTUB8", "B003UESJH4", "B004YCKJNI", "B004SEUJBE", "B00005NGAE", "B0008ENIKM", "B001KZOVJK", "B000KWZ7JC", "B003GOP0D4", "B001ECDVJU", "B007XTDWKQ", "B00031TXC2", "B00GSBMNOQ", "B00BTYSIV4", "B00D2CYU2W", "0783240171", "B000HT3PGU", "B00G7QPXUI", "B00008L3U6", "B000RPCK2E", "B00E849QSG", "B000055WFW", "B00441GYV0", "B00E1HIWXU", "B00GUO2SKA", "B005S9EJ14", "B00508W3FW", "B00CFHEF48", "B0045HCJ80", "B0017I79BW", "B001DJ7PR8", "B004ZJHSAM", "B0006SGYM4", "B0007QJ1ZW", "B000ND91YU", "B004SIP9VA", "B007P7UF0G", "B005VH4HCE", "B00000G3I2", "B001D8W7EU", "B003WKQ46E", "B0000CE684", "B0036TGT8Y", "B00005JKNF", "B0001FR54I", "B0090XLDKY", "B00HHYF5EI", "B000FC2FX8", "B003O2H7MA", "B0007ZEOPK", "B00GWWV1XU", "B00H83EUQW", "B004G7XCRQ", "B00003CXC9", "B00GHP8SH4", "B00008DDRU", "B000KNFP6G", "6305803765", "B0001CNRBG"], "bought_together": ["B000294SIE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0001WTWXS", "B00023GGHQ", "B000294SIE", "B00094ARN2"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 10160}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.48, "brand": "Generic", "asin": "B00067BBLY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51E8VXPWJML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "De-Lovely: The Cole Porter Story (Special Edition)"}
{"description": "That rare thing, decency, shines out ofWilbur (Wants to Kill Himself), a wonderful and dark-humored comedy about a would-be suicide. The depressive Wilbur (Jamie Sives) is the opposite of his big-hearted brother, Harbour (Adrian Rawlins), yet he remains irresistible to women--including Harbour's new live-in girlfriend. Director Lone Scherfig uses the gray-skied Edinburgh location in much the same way she did her native Denmark in the terrificItalian for Beginners; the gloomy setting belies the vaguely magical things that might happen to the characters. Scherfig knows just how to balance different tones (and in a comedy about a suicidal man, she has to), and she's great with actors, even in small roles. Special standouts here are the beaming Rawlins and Danish actor Mads Mikkelsen (King Arthur), as a stoical, chain-smoking doctor.

{"description": "Richard Widmark never had better exercise for his Cagney-like bouncing-ball energy thanNight and the City, a classic film noir about a hustler's meteoric flame-out. Although acknowledged as one of the great noir pictures, it's actually set and shot in London, which gives an exotic, displaced novelty to the usual noir universe. Widmark's performance as Harry Fabian is a jibbering, wheedling, giggling tour de force, as Harry schemes his way to setting up a wrestling match and finally establishing himself as a \"somebody.\" Instead, he manages to irritate the underworld heavies (memorably, Herbert Lom and Francis L. Sullivan) whose fingers are already deeply into the criminal pie. Gene Tierney and Googie Withers are the women--one good, one bad--who witness Harry's descent. This was director Jules Dassin's final project for a Hollywood studio before the blacklist forced him out, and he packs the film with tortured camera angles and spidery noir shadows; the movie's a real visual clambake.Night and the Citywas remade, tiredly, with Robert De Niro in 1992.

{"description": "Marvel Comics'Fantastic Fouranimated series (1994-95)--depicting the first family of superheroes--got significantly better as it went along.  The series always had good intentions, borrowing plots, concepts, characters, and even lines of dialogue from the classicStan Lee-Jack Kirby comic booksthat kicked off the Marvel age of comics.  And it was willing to spend two or even three episodes on a single story line.  The early episodes, however, had serious drawbacks, such as a clumsy animation style (the Silver Surfer never looked less noble), weak humor (the origin episode created a framing sequence in which the FF appears on theDick Cavett Show), and an awful theme song by Giorgio Moroder (Flashdance,Top Gun).  Fortunately, the animation improved in the second season, and instrumental theme music replaced the song.  Memorable moments from the series include the monumental Frightful Four-Inhumans tie-in and Galactus's search for a new herald. Memorable characters include villains Doctor Doom, the Skrulls, the Mole Man, and the Puppet Master, and heroes Daredevil, the Black Panther, Thor, and the Hulk. Guest voices include Ron Perlman, Michael Dorn, Kathy Ireland, Mark Hamill, and John Rhys-Davies.  It's worth a look for FF fans, especially in the complete four-disc set that contains all 29 episodes, a welcome change from Disney's single-disc compilations of theSpider-Manseries from the same time period.

Set during South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission, the film is adapted from Antjie Krog'sCountry of My Skull.

The two meet during the hearings and take an instant dislike to each other. In due time, however, they come to an understanding and embark on a tentative affair, despite Anna's faith in the hearings and Langston's doubts. John Boorman, whose previous features were the underratedBeyond RangoonandThe Tailor of Panama, coaxes sensitive performances from his leads and sheds welcome light on an important event, butIn My Countrynever catches fire.

{"description": "\"Editing is what makes film afilm.\" That audacious statement is made at the beginning of this 2005 documentary about the art of film editing. After listening to many editors and directors, movie novices as well as cinephiles may agree. Kathy Bates narrates this whirlwind history of the art punctuated by dozens of scenes to illustrate the effect of film editing in heightening reality and making a visceral impact on the filmgoer. In fact, the profession seems to be run on \"a gut feeling\" whether it's clipping a few frames, or 20 minutes of the final act (which we learn happened withLenny). James Cameron illustrates the importance of a frame as we see a scene fromTerminator 2with 1 frame out 24 missing (24 frames representing one second of film). Or as Quentin Tarantino states, \"musicians have notes, editors have frames.\" It's fascinating to see how editing--the process of assembling the film after it's been shot--can save films, make performances better, and become the ultimate jigsaw puzzle. The last concept is demonstrated as we return time and again to the most well-known editor of the time, Walter Murch (Apocalypse Now,The English Patient), as he edits a few scenes fromCold Mountainin front of us. We see how he works with light, covers mistakes, and controls emotion. For those who wished for a sequel to the excellent documentary on cinematographers,Visions of Light(1993), here's the next step (although made by different folks including first-time director Wendy Apple). Now, anyone want to tackle art directors?--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["0240813979", "B003S6KGNY", "1879505622", "B00329PYH0", "0240818563", "630583685X", "B009NUVVVK", "B00197POY0", "6305941122", "B000UJCAKY", "B008ZDC7M8", "B002HOP43K", "B004MQ6W5K", "B005CQW9R4", "0240810805", "B004NRMGGM", "0073386154", "1932907629", "B0000AKY7F", "B003N3UE6Q", "0073535095", "B0004Z312K", "B004NRTEPI", "0240812174", "0941188108", "B005KLOPU0", "1615930558", "B000XECFXS", "B001I2EQUO", "1615930906", "B009NUVVZ6", "0465020704", "0375709827", "187950541X", "B0001MDQ9E", "B003ASLJLS", "B000H0HRWM", "B0009HMTEO", "0240812093", "B005KLOPTG", "B00009PY57", "193290705X", "B0050FXDDQ", "B0002CHIKG", "1615930876", "B00094AS72", "193290753X", "B000SOMEKM", "B003WN0E3K", "630507559X", "B000092T5D", "1879505231", "007351201X", "0240517385", "B000059HBY", "B003AWEZ74", "6305131104", "0571211259", "B0013MYB5Y", "B00K0MM4AM", "0240813987", "6305999872", "1133727980", "0240812417", "B000FSMEDS", "0446550272", "B002945DVG", "024081150X", "024052120X", "0321635272", "B00005AUK9", "B001C71IEM", "B002Y58G7S", "0321918673", "B00507T4BO", "1615931546", "0240809351", "0767846869", "B000021Y77", "1435459113", "B00FGVS07S", "1133590462", "0205856160", "155783699X", "B000096FUD", "B00F98FOFY", "1133788882", "B000TJ0SB8", "B0000WN1JA", "186205942X", "0984157603", "B004UXUV98", "B00A2XQTIC", "193290736X", "0452286786", "B002M2T1VI", "B0001907AI", "B005GRF3BS", "B00005JKPT", "B000929VTU"], "bought_together": ["1879505622"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000CCBCAI", "B009NUVVVK", "B00329PYH0", "1879505622"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 94395}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 24.99, "brand": "Cutting Edge", "asin": "B0009PVZEG", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5113UeT00CL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Cutting Edge - The Magic of Movie Editing"}

After finishing a motorcycle race in New Hampshire, Bud Clay (Vincent Gallo) loads his racing bike into the back of his van and begins a cross-country odyssey to Los Angeles, where he is to compete in another race. During his trip, he meets three very different women: Violet, a wholesome all-American gas station attendant; Lilly (Cheryl Tiegs), a fellow lost soul he connects with at a highway rest stop; and Rose, a Las Vegas prostitute. Throughout his journey, Bud can never escape his intense feelings for the love of his life, Daisy (Chlo&#xEB; Sevigny), so he plans to reconcile with her when he reaches Los Angeles. Arriving in Los Angeles, Bud checks into a motel before visiting the abandoned home he once shared with Daisy. He leaves a note, hoping she will turn up at his motel room . . .Building to a notorious climax, the film presents one of the frankest portrayals of male sexuality ever seen in American cinema.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000092T3X", "B000BGH29K", "B00003JRAV", "B001AZKB8K", "B000L6S92E", "B000FZEQCS", "B0015FHDWM", "B00023P4I8", "B003B2UK1S", "B000LAZDQA", "B00GRZPRB4", "B00JVQ7QTM", "B000059HA5", "B0035L1PHI", "B0076ANKUY", "B002R3CQDC", "B00G5GNZ78", "B00GPPXNIK", "B003XKNGNW", "B006Z7Z3VS", "B0000BWVD9", "B00EOBB7LC", "B00005U14H", "B000F0UUD2", "B00009W0U4", "B000EZ8ZRG", "B00005LPZW", "B0007TZHWA", "B006M3M5FM", "B000DZ95MG", "B000BBOUBS", "B00C8CQ5SO", "B00005JKJG", "B000BBOUUE", "B001PYD0LQ", "B000059XTM", "B002JCYSL4", "6305127654", "B00A7WHL08", "B00BJSLNN0", "B00JDOQMH4", "B009M4KTUG", "B00008972P", "B0000ZMGWK", "B00005JMIJ", "B00HVOFP6W", "B00JJ3EHCG", "B00FKPJ3VM", "B00ET2ODU8", "B0026LYMAU", "B0002V7O10", "B0002JZT5A", "B000TXPXAU", "B004GBMVTW", "B00AY6PK5A", "B00AYGVCCK", "B0040J1RX6", "B00ET2ODTE", "B0019K4YT8", "B00049QR18", "B00275EGNS", "B00005JKJA", "B00B022GVS", "B003KGBISO", "B00004U104", "B00CPTUO1Y", "B00003CWN3", "B0042FUHSY", "B00AKLLSNC", "B000MRA6XM", "B0040HOW58", "B005ER6TAE", "B00DVD5SBE", "B0020LH8WU", "B0004Z32NI", "B00H83OHP6", "B004SKJYJG", "B005XB8T68", "B008NA3I30", "B001DJ7PQY", "B0082A3HFK", "B00GPPXNQ2", "B006OB3K56", "B0076ZQDPI", "B0001EFUFK", "B000089730", "B001FRNB9E", "B004XIWRW4", "B00005QJIG", "B0002DB52M", "B003KGBISE", "B00EMAGKNU", "B00APUAKYG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000092T3X", "B000BGH29K", "B001AZKB8K", "B000L6S92E"]}, "price": 9.47, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 55638}, "asin": "B0009VRHLK", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51FNB3YQJBL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Brown Bunny"}

{"description": "How is it possible that11:14went virtually unreleased in theaters? After modest film-festival exposure, it played briefly in San Francisco in August 2005 (over two years after it was completed), but that's a cruel twist of fate for such a cleverly twisted movie about cruel twists of fate. Destined for sleeper status on DVD (and given a slightly higher profile by Hilary Swank's subsequent Oscar-winning performance inMillion Dollar Baby), the audacious debut of writer-director Greg Marcks boasts a fantastic cast in a smartly constructed comedy/thriller, partly inspired byBlood Simple, in which a fatal traffic accident is examined and re-examined from multiple perspectives. The flashback structure involves all of the characters and events that lead up to the accident's deadly occurrence at 11:14 on an otherwise pleasant evening in Middleton, a typical suburb of Anytown, USA (filmed in the vicinity of Los Angeles). Marcks's screenplay attracted an impressive ensemble cast (costar Swank also signed on as an executive producer), and they're all given equal time as the intertwined plots are revealed. They include Rachael Leigh Cook (whose bad-girl behavior sets the chain of events in motion); Patrick Swayze and Barbara Hershey as her worried parents; Swank and Shawn Hatosy as would-be criminals with a dimwit plan; Henry Thomas as a drunk driver whose involvement is deeper than we realize; and Colin Hanks as one of three teenage vandals on a fast track to trouble. With falling corpses, graveyard sex, reckless gunplay, and a severed penis, it's all in good, grisly fun (apart from intricate plotting, Marcks has no lofty agenda up his sleeve), and there's ultimately not much point to its random misfortune, but11:14is clearly the work of a promising filmmaker, worthy of rediscovery on DVD. Bonus features include Marcks's intelligent commentary, a standard behind-the-scenes featurette, and a useful \"character jump\" feature allowing viewers to choose a plot trajectory whenever one character encounters another.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0040J1RX6", "B0014Z4OKW", "6305720134", "B001URA5Y8", "B000BBOUUE", "B00008L3TK", "B003U6SJY0", "B004SUDQAE", "B0034JKYSC", "B0002J58GU", "B002NALPFO", "B0009ML2UG", "B0016MJ6WE", "B0000996F3", "B004QXJZY4", "B001AIQ14A", "B00000F8KW", "6305133409", "B001C5LLVE", "B002PQ1PBA", "B004RE29WM", "B000CQQIDU", "B0001BRSRG", "B000MTFFO0", "B0000639HN", "B000CQLZ0Q", "B000GI3KGM", "B00AEBB86U", "0783228686", "B001CRC4DG", "B00HOGBXS6", "B001U0HB5Q", "B006GVN05O", "B00112S8RS", "B0009S4IG0", "B00BNH9NCU", "B000PISZ7W", "B001B73Q20", "B007UW9WMS", "B000GDH9NM", "B003EYVXTG", "B00004WI53", "B0000AC8LR", "B0082CWTSY", "B008PUI1GM", "B000FFJ826", "0767835093", "B000MGUZCU", "B000FUTVLY", "B0002KQNMC", "B000E6ESL2", "B00DPUB56U", "B0034G4P30", "B009AMAJPA", "B00JPQ1I7O", "B005Z9MFCM", "B00005YUPD", "B004EC5ITI", "B0031U8OEK", "B003AWRM9M", "B001AK3S4O", "B002S5N052", "B00003CWN3", "B004O8OLO0", "B00I45844W", "B00IKM5MIA", "B001K98MG4", "B000MMMTBY", "B003IIST9U", "B001UDS4BS", "B00007AJE1", "B0083QN87K", "B00000IBL1", "B004EQAVA0", "B000KX0IOK", "B00275EGNS", "B00HF98SHG", "B0097C046W", "B000GB5M3S", "B00J5G1P2W", "B00005A3KS", "B00AEFXGIY", "B002UOMGYW", "B0011VIO3W", "B000PKG8TM", "B00A47BT7C", "0792838041", "B004SIP7VM", "B000A3XY5A", "B00008EY9G", "B0001FGBSE", "B001MVYUR0", "B0030E5NJ6", "B007549W62", "B00000F35Z", "B005Z9MGRG", "B000HC2M0C", "B00005JH9M", "B003498SCQ", "B000GI3KGC"], "bought_together": ["B0040J1RX6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["6305133409", "B0034JKYSC", "B0040J1RX6", "B000FI8MPW"]}, "price": 5.0, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 75977}, "asin": "B000ALM40I", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516T38H2WQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "11:14"}

{"description": "Keep reeling in the years with the third season of Fox's popular and long-running teen comedyThat '70s Show. As usual, this season's adventures for Eric Foreman (Topher Grace) and his friends in the wilds of suburban Wisconsin circa the mid-'70s are broadly humorous (often to the point of slapstick), but the performances are genuinely warm and honest, especially between Eric and girlfriend Donna (Laura Prepon), and Eric and his parents (the wry Kurtwood Smith and Debra Jo Rupp). Episodes in season 3 center around the complicated relationships within Eric's gang--Eric and Donna attempt to resist the urge to take their romance to a physical level, while Kelso (Ashton Kutcher), Jackie (Mila Kunis), and Hyde (the show's secret comedy weapon, Danny Masterson) find themselves in an unlikely romantic triangle. Other season highlights include the Halloween Hitchcock tribute \"Too Old to Trick or Treat, Too Young to Die\"; Fez (Wilmer Valderamma) spoils Kelso's attempts to get back together with Jackie (\"Ice Shack\"); and Fez's disastrous relationship with the possibly deranged Caroline (a multi-episode arc starting with \"Fez Gets the Girl\").  The Season 3 set offers all 25 episodes on a four-disc set, and features a wealth of fun extras that should make it a must-have for series fans. Commentary by director David Trainer is featured on six episodes (writer Patrick Kienlen joins him for three), and several cast members provide introductions to each episode (though oddly, not Grace and Prepon).--Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["B007C8RZL0", "B0058JEHSO", "B008L0YMZA", "B0058JEHTS", "B008L0YN18", "B00B04NJ1M", "B00B04NII6", "B005GYXNXQ", "B008XJM89Q", "B0058E675U", "B008XAT0KA", "B00KY9N0S6", "B007C8RZR4", "B005X7HA58", "B00K8HAKSW", "B00KHB4CAG", "B007C8RZYC", "B007C8RZJW", "B00BUWD7Y8", "B000GPIPTM", "B0058EE6O4", "B0058J3S16", "B00A2XQU7M", "B00BUWD7SO", "B001DPHDBU", "B008L0YMUK", "B0058EE6NK", "B007C8RZXS", "B001L1S1R6", "B00B04NIOU", "B0019CSXAM", "B000AQ68VO", "B000TGJ82G", "B00070HK4C", "B000TGURZ8", "B00008YGRV", "B00005JLEX", "B00B04NJ12", "B0000C9JFQ", "B0019CLMW8", "B000BNTM46", "B009LDD1X0", "B0007R4SWC", "B00005JNEQ", "B00000F5W8", "B0000CGNEC", "B001L1S1WQ", "B000ZS8GXA", "B0053O89WY", "B008L0YN6I", "B00A2XQTVY", "B000U1ZV1W", "B0044784YY", "B0001BS3IY", "B000HT3P7E", "B0058JEI06", "B000AJJNI6", "B000NOKFH6", "B000I0QLR8", "B00005JM3G", "B000B5XOW0", "B00K8HALVI", "B000TM1CKQ", "B000QDLSR0", "B003L77G6A", "B0019D151K", "B003TNW02G", "B002WQ799U", "B001APMD1I", "B008412UKA", "B000CCBCGM", "B000W91RUG", "B0009IW88K", "B0006Q93AQ", "B000957O8C", "B000I0QLQY", "B001VPJYZ0", "B00008NV4G", "B006MFQ4DE", "B000EYK4H6", "B000NA1W3Q", "B002WQ79A4", "B0012018OE", "B001VFM0ZG", "B000K4X5QM", "B00127RAFS", "B000068CNX", "B002N5N4M6", "B000A7PKGW", "B0058EE6OO", "B000AJJNIQ", "B000QFCDAO", "B001B7CNZ6", "B001O4KBO6", "B000FUTVLO", "B0044R7VCK", "B000EXDS7K", "B000GRU09S", "B000083C6V", "B003L77GJM"], "bought_together": ["B007C8RZL0", "B008L0YMZA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00BUWD7Y8", "B0058JEHSO", "B0058JEHTS", "B007C8RZL0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 146736}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 24.99, "brand": "20th Century Fox", "asin": "B000AP04TM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/517VVRRE21L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "That '70s Show: Season 3"}
{"description": "House of Dis a bittersweet, moving story of an American expatriate's painful decision to come to terms with the childhood he fled in early 1970s New York City. David Duchovny wrote and directed this comedy-drama; he also stars as the adult version of the film's hero, Tom Warshaw, an illustrator who has spent most of his life in Paris and decides&#x97;on the occasion of his son's birthday&#x97;to finally reveal long-withheld facts about his past.The bulk of the story, told in flashback, portrays 13-year-old Tom (Anton Yelchin) as a quick-witted prince of his neighborhood, a delivery boy who knows every eccentric on his bicycle route and a Catholic school kid fond of playing pranks on his clueless French teacher and soulful principal (Frank Langella). His best friend is the school's mildly retarded, 41-year-old janitor, Pappas (Robin Williams), and his advisor on matters of the heart is Lady (Erykah Badu), a prison inmate whom the fatherless Tom (or Tommy, as he's called in 1973) can neither see nor touch. Tommy's vivacity is an asset at home, where his mother (Tea Leoni), a grieving widow with a mounting addiction to pills, is slipping away from her son's ability to help. Duchovny's screenplay sometimes borders on the precious: A number of scenes are enamored with their own boldness and originality, as if Duchovny has been squirreling away lots of colorfully expressive storytelling details for years, and unloaded them here. But that flaw all but disappears in the glow ofHouse of D's emotional resonance and honesty, not to mention several exceptional performances. Among these is Zelda Williams's work as Tommy's sage-beyond-her-years girlfriend, Melissa, whose name offers a suitable excuse to work a rather lovely Allman Brothers song into the soundtrack.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0019X3YTQ", "B0007XG4XW", "B0043X1FM2", "6305262128", "B00008L3U1", "B00005UQ9V", "B00J5JSV3A", "B000N4RAR4", "B00005V9HT", "B00175VSBC", "B00BX8PG5M", "B0002XNT1C", "B004SIP6VI", "B00007AJFD", "6304584210", "B00114XTHA", "B003EYVXOG", "6306012419", "B000085EFG", "B0019X3YUA", "B003IQBLSI", "B0000694XY", "B000BYA4IS", "B00000IQV7", "B000YV1Q2G", "B00AEFXGIY", "B004SUDQ72", "B003LR5BD0", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B0071HPOLK", "B002PI1NRO", "0788815466", "B001FACH7S", "B004ZJZQAQ", "B004SIP6C2", "B008220A62", "B00003CWS3", "B000B8QG22", "B004SIP7ZS", "B0009H97HG", "B003EYVXOQ", "B00007976U", "B005QX8U2Q", "B0013N2WFY", "B00079HZOS", "B00133KFGW", "B000FDEVA2", "B002QQ8HAG", "B00000J11D", "1558908404", "B000OYC7BW", "B00BTYRB3U", "B00AEFYMGO", "B006YTGL86", "B00003CXQ4", "B000M341SC", "B000035Z3C", "B000077VQ6", "B000286RP2", "B000LC5B7O", "B0000714C4", "B002GIBVVQ", "B000NO39FG", "B003B3O5K4", "B00CYQXCDK", "B00AEFYVZQ", "B00003CXE4", "B00003CX8N", "B00GSBMNOQ", "B000063US3", "B00DL46ZN8", "B0007X7044", "B001CIOCLC", "B0043X1FL8", "B001JIE7JC", "B009AMAL4Y", "B00CCXL9OE", "B000P5FH3K", "B00004Y62V", "B0009UZGIM", "B000957O82"], "bought_together": ["B0007XG4XW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0007XG4XW", "B00BTYNXJG", "B0019X3YTQ", "B000UAE7KO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 175614}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.73, "brand": "LION&#39;S GATE ENTERTAINMENT", "asin": "B000ARFPNK", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51K4DAM9FWL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "House of D"}
{"description": "If the idea of making a musical out of Roger Corman's Z-movie quickieThe Little Shop of Horrorssounded weird, stick around for the all-singing, all-dancingReefer Madness. Deliriously based on the notorious 1936anti-pot social-guidance film, this is an ultra-campy enterprise that lands somewhere betweenRocky Horrorand a John Waters comedy. Christian Campbell and the spritzy Kristen Bell play the innocent teens lured into a soul-sapping cloud of marijuana dependence by pencil-mustached pusher Steven Weber and his long-suffering dame, Ana Gasteyer. The cast includes femme fatale Amy Spanger and a cameo by Neve Campbell, who dances her way through one sequence. The musical was written and composed by Kevin Murphy and Dan Studney, who re-create some of the kookiest scenes from the original movie (\"Faster! Faster!\"). Their funniest idea is to frame the sordid saga with a black-and-white story of a government agent showing a public-service film to horrified small-town citizens; he's played by the reliably sinister Alan Cumming, who also pops up in a variety of guises in the film-within-the-film. The only problem with this made-for-Showtime version of the stage show is that camp tends to wear thin, especially at 109 minutes, despite the expert song parodies.

{"description": "More than merely a sports documentary or an inspirational profile of triumph over adversity, \"Murderball\" offers a refreshing and progressive attitude toward disability while telling unforgettable stories about uniquely admirable people. It's ostensibly a film about quadriplegic rugby (or \"Murderball,\" as it was formerly known), in which players with at least \"some\" loss of physical function in all four limbs navigate modified wheelchairs in a hardcore, full-contact sport that takes them all the way to the Paralympic Games in Athens, Greece, in 2004. But as we get to know paralyzed or amputee players on Team USA like Andy Cohn, Scott Hogsett, Bob Lujano and charismatic team spokesman Mark Zupan, we come to understand that quad rugby is a saving grace for these determined competitors, who battle Team Canada coach (and former Team USA superstar) Joe Soares en route to the climactic contest in Athens. Simply put, \"Murderball\" is the best film to date about living with a severe disability, but codirectors Henry Alex Rubin and Dana Adam Shapiro avoid the sappy, inspirational sentiment that hampers nearly all mainstream films involving disability. By the time this blazing 85-minute film reaches its emotional conclusion, the issue of disability is almost irrelevant; these guys are as normal as anyone, and their life stories led to \"Murderball\" becoming the most critically acclaimed documentary of 2005. \"--Jeff Shannon\"", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002KE5VUS", "B000XQ4HR8", "B0007WFYBG", "B001E5FYS8", "B009YQJ2Q4", "B004YEMK7O", "B000BMY2NS", "B00005RIY3", "B00DUX290S", "B006JN8748", "B0007V6IUS", "B000A2XCBC", "B00007ELEK", "B008SGVSMM", "B00GV8B0OA", "B00GMV8DFU", "B00005JNV9", "B004YCKKIM", "B004U7MR1Y", "0786881623", "B0003JAO8Q", "B000CDSS18", "B0012LDNIC", "B002PLMJ74", "B00EPD3CC6", "0767846869", "B00DVLKMWQ", "B0000SXK0Y", "B0013LRKYO", "B001QTVP8A", "159486845X", "0472032364", "B00022FW4U", "0812924126", "B00AEK9BKQ", "B000189DZE", "0767821432", "B0001L3LUE", "B000MZGN40", "B004UXUV98", "B004IOPDJ2", "0803621795", "B008IG09FO", "0679728244", "B0087OULO6", "B002LE8MP8", "B000A3XY5A", "0240812417", "B00A92MGLA", "B0000WN13Q", "0470619007", "1932603336", "B000ELL1RG", "B0038M2AZA", "B00375LBK8", "1401812325", "B00CTBQUIE", "0814785646", "B002TVQ48A", "0807022020", "B0027BOL4G", "B008VR7U8O", "B001BEK8FQ", "B005S9EIGU", "B000FIMG7C", "B00009YXAS", "B001QIP5C8", "0814757286", "B00A4TMLKE", "B00020X94W", "B000GBEWMA", "B00005KHJY", "B0002OXVBO", "B007CEFTSA", "0781783518", "B0000YEEGM", "B00008DDVV", "B007UW9WOQ", "B002E01LOI", "0800177258", "B008JFUTT0", "B00AIBZKFG", "B0087IT8FK", "B004CJQVQC", "B00AEFZ63M", "B000E1NXJ0", "0822351110", "B001EP8EOY"], "bought_together": ["B000XQ4HR8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000GG1F4S", "B000XQ4HR8", "B001E5FYS8"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 89146}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.89, "brand": "THINKFILM LLC", "asin": "B000B5XP24", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61YKSQPQ5PL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Murderball"}
{"description": "A decade after their last hilarious short, the Oscar-winning A Close Shave, Claymation wonders Wallace and Gromit return for a full-length adventure. Daffy scientist Wallace (voiced by Peter Sallis) and his heroic dog Gromit are doing well with their business, Anti-Pesto, a varmint-hunting outfit designed to keep their English town safe from rabbits chomping on prized vegetables. Wallace meets Lady Tottington (Helena Bonham Carter), who appreciates Wallace's humane way of dealing with rabbits (courtesy of the Bun-Vac 6000), and sets up a rivalry with the gun-toting Victor Quartermaine (Ralph Fiennes, enjoying himself more than ever). Creator Nick Park, with co-director/writer Steve Box, delivers a story worthy of the 85-minute running time, although it stretches the act a bit; the formula plays better shorter, but the literally hand-crafted film is a joy to watch. Taking a chapter from classic horror films, a giant were-rabbit is soon on the prowl, and the town is up in arms, what with the annual vegetable contest close at hand. (Anyone who's seen the previous three shorts knows who saves the day.) Never content to do something simply when the extravagant will do, W&G;'s lives are filled with whimsical Rude Goldberg-style devices, and the opening number showcasing their alarm system is pure Aardman Animation at its finest.

{"description": "Blockbuster action director Michael Bay delivers a striking look at a strange world of the future in this sci-fi action drama. Midway through the 21st century, Lincoln Six Echo (Ewan McGregor) lives in a confined indoor community after ongoing abuse of the Earth has rendered most of the planet uninhabitable. One of the only places in the outside world still capable of sustaining life is an idyllic island where citizens are chosen to live through a lottery. Or at least that's what Lincoln and his fellow citizens are taught to believe; the truth is that Lincoln, like everyone he knows, is actually a clone who is kept under wraps to provide needed organs when the person who supplied his or her DNA falls ill. When he becomes aware that his existence is a fraud, Lincoln escapes to the outside world with a fellow clone, Jordan Two Delta (Scarlett Johansson), though the powers that be are determined to see that no one gets away alive.The Islandalso stars Steve Buscemi, Djimon Hounsou, Michael Clarke Duncan, and Sean Bean.", "related": {"also_bought": ["0767805712", "B002UZCJ8Y", "B0069UP2PI", "B00005JL78", "B0013PSTMC", "B004LWZW7E", "B004XQO90O", "B008JFUO36", "B000TGJ8CQ", "B00AEFXCLU", "B001GCUO02", "B0001NBNDY", "B002GIBVVG", "B00KHWSB5M", "B0018O4YT0", "B00005JLWN", "B0001CNRAM", "B002ZG98SW", "B00005JN0T", "B00K7IPFSM", "B00JPFTX5O", "B0009YA3OA", "B001CC7PLM", "B000AP04FG", "B005LAIIMG", "B005LAII8A", "B0013LL2Z2", "B002ZG980U", "B008JFUN50", "B00005JMWP", "B000EQHXNW", "B004WCTLNY", "B004EPYZOO", "B001GKJ2E8", "B007R6DJP8", "B00AEFXSLE", "B00AKGG8I2", "B000EZ908Y", "B00AIBZMD6", "B00BEIYIF0", "B0045HCJ8A", "B004LWZW4M", "B000BVM1S2", "B0067EKYAY", "B00AEBB8NI", "B001FB55HQ", "B00005JPAR", "B004LWZW42", "B001VLBDD0", "B0062P3392", "B000FS9FCG", "B008JFUPFI", "B00IKM5MIA", "B004A8ZX28", "B000056PMU", "B00005JPD0", "B005COLETU", "B003Q6D2B4", "B004EPYZSK", "B000P0J0EW", "B009AMAJPA", "B002SG7Z7A", "B00H83EUQW", "B000LC55F2", "B00DWZHTOU", "B005NKIPUY", "B005LAIHPE", "B000A2IPQY", "B00AEBB89W", "B0051MKNV8", "B005LAIIPS", "B001EAWMGA", "B00A7MSQRK", "6304711891", "B000QQJ3Q0", "B002GHHHOC", "B0021L8V0M", "B000P0I4O4", "B0013FDM7E", "B00AS1Q93S", "B00004XPPG", "B0045HCJFS", "B003UYUQZW", "B001OQCVI8", "B003QO8TOQ", "B00096S49Y", "B005LAIGRS", "B000EGDB10", "B002ZG984Q", "B000FGGE68", "B003L20IG0", "B0036TGSR6", "B0045HCJGC", "B002DU39GW", "B0002KVUKM", "B008JFUQZ2", "B000H30B2C", "0767803434", "B00AEBB8QK"], "bought_together": ["0767805712", "B0069UP2PI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004WCTLNY", "B004XQO90O", "B00JJ3EHCG", "B004SBQAN8"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 95555}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.44, "brand": "Dreamworks Skg", "asin": "B000BO0LH2", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5133H8SZ04L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Island"}
{"description": "In this third season, Mary Richards (Mary Tyler Moore), she of the \"bright smile and infectious vivacity,\" got to display some of that celebrated \"spunk\" of hers. In the season&#x96;opener, \"The Good-Time News,\" she demands to be paid the same amount of money as her predecessor. In \"The Georgette Story,\" she defies her boss, Lou Grant (Ed Asner), and vainglorious anchorperson Ted Baxter (Ted Knight) by counseling Ted's new girlfriend, whom he takes for granted. And in \"Romeo and Mary,\" she finally stands up to an overzealous suitor (guest star Stuart Margolin), which hilariously backfires on her.The Mary Tyler Moore Showendures because its timeless comedy is drawn from the wellspring of its fully drawn characters, who were allowed to grow beyond one-note caricatures. Mary's best friend, Rhoda (Valerie Harper), who was in danger of becoming this series' Sally Rogers, really blossomed this season. In \"Rhoda the Beautiful,\" the slimmed-down Rhoda is empowered to enter a beauty contest, and in \"My Brother's Keeper,\" she catches the eye of Phyllis' (Cloris Leachman in an Emmy-nominated performance) brother, which devastates Phyllis, setting the stage for yet another disastrous Mary Richards party (and a d&#xE9;nouement that must have been daring in 1973). Wise-cracking Murray (Gavin McLeod) reveals new depths in \"Murray Faces Life,\" in  which he sinks into depression after hearing that a former college classmate has won the Pulitzer Prize. Even Ted manages to surprise. In \"Operation: Lou,\" a hospitalized Lou Grant finds a new appreciation for Ted, who graciously and uncharacteristically, presents him with an expensive bottle of scotch. Moore, Harper, and Knight were each honored with Emmys this season. Joining this august core ensemble is Georgia Engel as Georgette, who makes a delightful first impression in \"Rhoda Morgenstern: Minneapolis to New York.\" Even hard-boiled Lou softens in her presence. \"You're a real cutie, you know that?\" he tells her in \"The Georgette Story.\" Despite Lou's insistence to the contrary in \"The Good-Time News,\"The Mary Tyler Moore's job was to make people laugh.

{"description": "A hilarious comedy about frustrated waiters, stingy tippers and dicey food, Lions Gate Films' WAITING... stars Ryan Reynolds, Anna Faris and Justin Long as young employees battling boredom at Shenanigan's, a generic chain restaurant. A waiter for four years since high school, Dean (Justin Long) has never questioned his job at Shenanigan's. But when he learns that Chett, a high school classmate, now has a lucrative career in electrical engineering, he's thrown into turmoil about his dead-end life. Dean's friend Monty (Ryan Reynolds) is in exactly the same boat, but he couldn't care less. More concerned with partying and getting laid, Monty is put in charge of training Mitch (John Francis Daley), a shy new employee.  Over the course of one chaotic shift, Mitch gets to know the rest of Shenanigan's quirky staff: Monty's tough-talking ex-girlfriend, Serena (Anna Faris), Shenanigan's over-zealous manager, Dan (David Koechner), and head cook Raddimus (Luis Guzman), who's obsessed with a senseless staff-wide competition known only as \"The Game\"...  Featuring crazy busboys, unsanitary kitchen antics, and lots of talk about sex, WAITING... is a hysterical, behind-the-scenes look at the restaurant industry, and an affectionate ode to those lost, and thoroughly unproductive, days of youth.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001MFNB58", "B000EMGJAO", "B000069CF0", "B000LC3ICE", "B000E6EHE0", "B00363WGBO", "B000JJ4DNW", "B000IZJZIU", "B000WZEZGI", "B0023TCWE8", "B000I0RNVQ", "B00AEFYS2M", "B001J9KJ4I", "B000AP04L0", "B001L9EXTS", "B000Y7U93C", "B00AEFZ3XU", "B001OD4S50", "B00AEFXVW0", "B00007AJGM", "B00005JNZU", "B0002V7TMY", "B000031WD9", "B000YW8RN6", "B00260HH1W", "B0016MJ6GA", "B0009P42WI", "B000063RQO", "B00005JKMN", "B002ZG97XI", "B0017JHQPK", "B000BKVQS4", "B004HO6I2E", "B0007DFJ0G", "B004SIP6LS", "B001G5T6GW", "B000M9CB4W", "B00000FA91", "B00005JMX6", "B00005V9HR", "0783230338", "B004SIP8ES", "B00AEFXIUK", "B00029RTAI", "B0009HBPN0", "B001O0TWYK", "B000K7VHOG", "B001KKU9DW", "6301964160", "B00860YIJU", "B000EGDBZ6", "630529142X", "B000J4P9P8", "B000WCN8QE", "B004I9SJH0", "B00005JMYI", "B00AEFY854", "B00003CXPS", "B00AEFYZCU", "B002Q4VBPQ", "B007D0FUTG", "B003Y5H5B0", "B000O77SF4", "B002FU8IWU", "B003PIUINS", "B00003CXWV", "B002IKIHEG", "B004SIP95G", "B008R65XNS", "B002T4GWWA", "B00AEFYAMA", "B0068MNO2U", "B000MCH5RM", "B000BO0L90", "B002ZGW92E", "B005LAIH9A", "B000G0O5I2", "0790729997", "B004EPZ084", "B00009W5F2", "B000N3SU92", "B00AEFY0XE", "B00008WJD6", "B004SEUJO6", "6305222908", "B00DW5IKYS", "B00AEBB8FQ", "B0026BXHQ0", "B00AEBBA2C", "B000OYC7BW", "B002ZG98B4", "B000FKO5QK", "B00029RTCG", "B000TZJBPQ", "B000031EFY", "B0016Q2D66", "B00AG4714S", "B0006HBZEW", "0800141687", "B00441GYVK"], "bought_together": ["B001MFNB58", "B000EMGJAO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00E8RKHWW", "B000AP04L0", "B004SEUIW4", "B000EMGJAO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 11312}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.21, "brand": "Vidmark/Trimark", "asin": "B000CPH9PM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51TJVHXCPGL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Waiting...

{"description": "On the surface, David Cronenberg may seem an unlikely candidate to directA History of Violence, but dig deeper and you'll see that he's the right man for the job. As an intellectual seeker of meaning and an avowed believer in Darwinian survival of the fittest, Cronenberg knows that the story of mild-mannered small-town diner proprietor Tom Stall (Viggo Mortensen) is in fact a multilayered examination of inbred human behavior, beginning when Tom's skillful killing of two would-be robbers draws unwanted attention to his idyllic family life in rural Indiana. He's got a loving wife (Maria Bello) and young daughter (Heidi Hayes) who are about to learn things about Tom they hadn't suspected, and a teenage son (Ashton Holmes) who has inherited his father's most prominent survival trait, manifesting itself in ways he never expected. By the time Tom has come into contact with a scarred villain (Ed Harris) and connections that lead him to a half-crazy kingpin (William Hurt, in a spectacular cameo), Cronenberg has plumbed the dark depths of human nature so skillfully thatA History of Violencestands well above the graphic novel that inspired it (indeed, Cronenberg was unaware of the source material behind Josh Olson's chilling adaptation). With hard-hitting violence that's as sudden as it is graphically authentic, this isA History of Violencethat's worthy of serious study and widespread acclaim.--Jeff ShannonOn the DVDOn a single disc and with little fanfare, this DVD makes an excellent case for the best extras of the year. Dive into the one-hour-long documentary and learn more about moviemaking than on many a double-disc. The secret lies in director David Cronenberg's (and his usual crew) folksy casualness in showing off the craft, be it makeup (green screens were used), directing (Cronenberg doesn't storyboard), or art direction (the diner set). It also is very funny to hear about \"fish Fridays\" and how Maria Bello's Uncle Pete became an influence. Even the infamous sex-on-the-staircase scene is diagnosed with candor as stars Viggo Mortensen and Bello act as if there is no backstage camera. There's only one deleted scene, but it's uncommonly deconstructed on why it was filmed and why it was cut (it's a very Cronenbergian dream sequence). A short bit on Cannes is also a delight.

{"description": "WhetherAmerican Dad!will ever enjoyFamily Guy's cult status  remains to be seen, but the first 13 episodes of its inaugural season,  collected in this extras-laden three-disc set, are promising. After a few  episodes, CIA agent Stan Smith and family gradually emerge from the Griffins' formidable shadow, and the show finds its own comic voice. And it sounds a lot like Paul Lynde. That would be Roger (voiced by Seth McFarlane), the housebound alien who saved Stan's life at Area 51 and now lives with the Smiths. Not as inspired a creation is Klaus, the German-accented goldfish who lusts after Stan's wife, Francine. He does, though, have an inspired meta-moment in the episode \"Bullocks to Stan,\" in which he provides faux scene-specific commentary (during the episode!) in anticipation of the show's release on DVD (\"I wasn't sure about the Squeaky Fromme reference,\" he offers, \"but it's a smart joke, and the fans have come to expect that from us\"). As for the rest of the clan, Steve's children are the typical dysfunctional siblings: Steve, a socially awkward geek, and Hayley, a liberal counterpoint to red, white, and blue-blooded Stan--at least liberal enough to sleep with Stan's boss, Bullock (playfully voiced by Patrick Stewart) in the episode \"Bullocks to Stan.\"Though the jokes inAmerican Dad!are not as free-associative as inFamily Guy, McFarlane cannot seem to resist dispensing with character integrity for a gratuitous potshot at, say, Lisa Kudrow. But as withFamily Guy,American Dad!tears at the sitcom envelope. The blasphemous episode \"Deacon Stan, Jesus Man,\" had the distinction of being voted \"Worst TV Show of the Week\" by the Parents Television Council. AndAmerican Dad!has its own version ofFamily Guy's surreal titanic bouts between Peter Griffin and that chicken. The episode \"Homeland Insecurity\" features a digression in which a Department of Water and Power worker greedily kills his partner over a gem-encrusted gold \"turd,\" only to find out his wife is having an affair. As he wails to the heavens, the words \"To be continued\" appear onscreen. According to the audio commentary, the writers do indeed intend to continue this compelling soap opera. So that's something to look forward to.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000NNK4DM", "B0012KSUTA", "B001RIZ7OI", "B003CN5B7E", "B003L77G7Y", "B0053O8A32", "B00BYNL8DU", "B00LFW6BA0", "B000083C6V", "B000HT3P6U", "B001VFM0ZG", "B000AQ68Z0", "B000RO6JZO", "B002JVWQYG", "B00008YGRV", "B0012018OE", "B003DZX46G", "B003L77G9W", "B0058RN7KA", "B0058YPMHO", "B00E0FW054", "B00FR81Z40", "B003V3FVQ6", "B008412UKA", "B000A3DFV8", "B008412UQ4", "B001RP976A", "B00BI5YEWG", "B00HDU9UOW", "B00775R45A", "B007ZFR67I", "B00023P49C", "B00008YGRS", "B0000AQS81", "B0001ZWLVU", "B0000CABL2", "B000ADWCYY", "B0001MZ7KA", "B004696M94", "B002HQK5O6", "B00005JM3G", "B00023P49M", "B00CO8WWS4", "B000KLQUMQ", "B007KFZ85K", "B0006Z2L2Y", "B008AITJ7O", "B005QIOJUI", "B00K8HAJN8", "B000AQ68VO", "B003X4KHRG", "B009SQ9Q5M", "B00363WGB4", "B000CNESM6", "B0040JHX0W", "B0002WZRSG", "B00F77MAO0", "B001N9VW5Y", "B00J5LXPPM", "B0007PAM06", "B000RPD0DC", "B0002XVQT4", "B000E0OE3K", "B000FSME2Y", "B000EHSVDC", "B0006B41GM", "B000RW3VDE", "B000R7I3XC", "B000F8O2QK", "B007KFZ7UQ", "B00F4NPBI4", "B006W93ELK", "B001BGS17G", "B002LARYTW", "B001L1S1PI", "B000ABKHZC", "B001G0MFFG", "B000RZIGX6", "B00008YGRZ", "B003KZ27N0", "B0007CILMA", "B00158K0V0", "B000067DNE", "B001O0TWXG", "B007KFZ8B4", "B000S76LKI", "B007KFZ7PG", "B000A6T27G", "B0024FAR52", "B0016KCCCM", "B00008EY6Q", "B0018O5WUU", "B005CHTXWC", "B0036TGTEI", "B004MLEYTG", "B007KFZ7YM", "B000B5XOR0", "B005QIOJ3A", "B000UZDO62", "B00DNQCH0Y"], "bought_together": ["B000NNK4DM", "B0012KSUTA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003L77G7Y", "B000083C6V", "B000NNK4DM", "B000AQ68Z0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 67450}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 14.59, "brand": "20th Century Fox", "asin": "B000E6ES9O", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51KK1TPJ7RL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "American Dad!, Vol. 1"}
{"description": "Who doesn't enjoy watching big things fall to pieces?Category 7: The End of the Worldwreaks havoc on the Eiffel Tower, Mt. Rushmore, the Pyramids, and a midwestern trailer park, among other things. More or less a sequel toCategory 6: Day of Destruction(presumably the latest in a series that began withCategory 1: Don't Forget Your Umbrella),Category 7offers the reassuring sight of Gina Gershon, skilled with disasters likeShowgirls, taking control of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Confronted with city-destroying weather, she calls in rebel meteorologist Ross Duffy (Cameron Daddo, star of such classics asPterodactylandAnthrax), who runs the Extreme Weather Lab and harbors theories that threaten the political status quo. Ross brings in Tommy Tornado (Randy Quaid, the sole returning actor fromCategory 6), Faith Clavell (Shannen Doherty,Charmed), and Col. Mike Davis (Tom Skerritt,Alien) to gather data...which isn't the most dramatic of activities (even when it involves souped-up cars and superjets), so the movie adds a subplot about a religious zealot (Nicholas Lea,The X-Files) who wants to unleash the plagues of Egypt so that everyone will realize it's the End of Days.   What does it all add up to? A lot of over-the-top hooey (and that's not including the assorted family turmoils), but pretty entertaining nonetheless. It's like a lesser Michael Crichton novel: Take an inflammatory vaguely scientific premise, add two-dimensional characters, cheesy but spectacular effects, and a full-throttle if nonsensical plot, and presto!

{"description": "The final season ofDawson's Creekis when the series becameJoey's Bar.  With the titular character (James Van Der Beek) mostly on the opposite coast working for tyrannical director Todd (Hal Ozsan) and dating an actress (Biana Kajlich), the series' other central protagonists tended to gather only at Joey's (Katie Holmes) workplace, a Boston college bar called Hell's Kitchen.  But those central characters usually went their separate ways, becoming the linchpins around which wound a dizzying array of new characters who were coincidentally interconnected.  Working at the bar are Emma (Megan Gray)--a punk rocker who ends up rooming with Pacey (Joshua Jackson) and Jack (Kerr Smith) and whose band Audrey (Busy Phillipps) joins as lead vocalist--and Eddie (Oliver Hudson), who's Joey's main antagonist in a lit class taught by an antagonistic professor (Roger Howarth).  While Joey is busy at Worthington, Jack and Jen (Michelle Williams) are at Boston Bay College, where both are attracted to a pop-culture professor (Sebastian Spence), but Jen ends up dating a help-line worker (Jensen Ackles).  Pacey goes Gordon Gecko in a new job as a stock broker mentored by a cutthroat businessman (Dana Ashbrook).  The lack of interaction among the main characters proved the biggest drawback to this era ofDawson's Creek, but when they were put together, sparks could still fly, such as when Pacey and Joey get locked in a Super K-Mart overnight, or when an old romance--and rivalry--is rekindled.  Season 6 was also the end ofDawson's Creek, and the episodes improved as they drew to their inevitable conclusion, peaking in the devastating series finale.  Creator Kevin Williamson returned to write a flash-forward in which the main characters are 25, and a reunion in Capeside leads to tragedy and some final decisions.The version of the series finale is the same that was released on astandalone DVD, complete with the extended cut, commentary track by Williamson and executive producer Paul Stupin, and all the original music such as Paula Cole's theme song and Beth Nielsen Chapman's \"Say Goodnight\" (though not the additional scenes from the pilot presentation).  The rest of the season replaces some songs as previous DVDs have done, including the theme song, but the No Doubt concert is complete.  Season guest stars in addition to No Doubt includeLoveline's Dr. Drew and Adam Carolla as themselves, and Mimi Rogers as Jen's mom (replacing season 3's Mel Harris).--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0007V6IW6", "B0002RQ3MK", "B0002234R2", "B0000AUHQ9", "B0000E5NPY", "B00008AOX3", "B0001IN0T4", "B0077PTWY6", "B000MEYJII", "B00LERXFJ6", "B0077PTWHI", "B00BGQ2NIO", "B0012GN23S", "B000NA1PUG", "B000BNXD6O", "B00127RAGM", "B0006FFRBG", "B002BAW6I6", "B002BAW6HW", "B000C8STWQ", "B00BGQ2NDO", "B00000IMY8", "B003R0MF7G", "B000C65Z8Y", "B000GYI32M", "B00083FZGI", "B004EYT590", "B003L77GEM", "B002JVWRB8", "B00133QNSG", "B0012BS5XU", "B005FISC52", "B00133QNRW", "B00133QNS6", "B0050MB5P2", "B00HEQOAIQ", "B001ULCY48", "B001EWDXT8", "B0002V7TZQ", "B0009K7QZ8", "B000EHQ7HY", "B0006J28DM", "B003FSTN4S", "B002BJGYTY", "B001G0MFD8", "B003F3NDW6", "B0001CCXZW", "B000FUTVPA", "B000FUTVLO", "B00HQOFAKI", "B000JLTRIG", "B0009A5MUO", "B002KQ6UE2", "B00005JO9J", "B00BMKGZVA", "B00F1FVKVC", "B00007IG1M", "B0012EM5DI", "B004GJYRFA", "B00915G6UI", "B00IGBIKV6", "B00BBGZ17O", "B000FIMG5Y", "B001UHOWYM", "B000OIOPHC", "B002BJGYU8", "0743416945", "1404975187", "B004YM6JF0", "B0026RLM6Q", "B001FB4VX0", "B00004X13T", "B003L77GFG", "0743416953", "B0009IW88K", "B000G1R4SY", "B000N6TYLW", "B009LDCWWG", "B0018CWEZI", "B0017VG67M", "B000O77SN6", "B000UAE7UY", "B004GSVX9O", "B002BJGYV2", "B000EHSVLY", "B0001O3YLM", "B00684J49U", "B000GG4Y6O", "B002BJGYTO", "B009Z5BPZK", "B002JVWRBS", "B001LM64WE", "B000P6YNSO", "B000EHSVMS", "B00HNGC5FC", "B001MVWRN4", "B000EHSVM8", "B003F3NE1Q", "B000H7JCGE", "B000MGBSI0"], "bought_together": ["B0007V6IW6", "B0002RQ3MK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005CGI3ZG", "B0002RQ3MK", "B0007V6IW6", "B00008AOX3"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 45148}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 20.08, "brand": "Columbia Tri Star", "asin": "B000EAT23C", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51whiLlT5jL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Dawson's Creek: Season 6"}

{"description": "This Jack Black vehicle seems, on the surface, like a perfect fit for the actor: an opportunity to showcase Black's unique style with the extreme facial gestures and exuberant physicality that have become his forte. Black plays Ignacio, a lowly cook in a monastery in central Mexico who feeds orphans by day, and wrestles in the town square at night. Ignacio teams up with Esqueleto (Hector Jimenez), a street urchin who tormented him, to form a tag-team duo that goes up against the strangest wrestlers Mexico has to offer. Besides doing it for money to feed the orphans, Ignacio is also fighting to win the forbidden affections of Sister Encarnacion (Ana de la Reguera) with predictable difficulty. While the movie has likeable characters and the plot is enjoyable enough, it can&#x92;t overcome its plodding pace and formulaic structure enough to keep the movie interesting throughout. Jack Black is a very strong comedic actor, and the wrestling scenes offer plenty of chances for slapstick, physical comedy, but watching him run around in red briefs and blue tights amounts to half the laughs in the movie, and there&#x92;s just not enough here for him to really work with. When he plays a more well-formed character, as inSchool of RockandHigh Fidelity, his strengths really show. But inNacho Librehe&#x92;s saddled with a caricature. Weighed down by too much low-brow humor and a script that goes nowhere,Nacho Librejust can&#x92;t make full enough use of Black&#x92;s talents to overcome the obstacles.--Daniel Vancini", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00H47IXTC", "B003498RCW", "B00AEFYP3E", "B00AEBB87O", "B00AEFY7YQ", "B001IKKMCW", "B001GPOSYC", "B00AEFYYA8", "B00BG4R476", "B00AEBB9C8", "B004IK30S2", "B000WQWPJQ", "B004SJ0EBE", "B005ERX1UU", "B0018O4YSQ", "B005DZ35TU", "B00AEFXXFU", "B00CXYCBNA", "B00AEFYRVO", "B002KLAL8S", "B00193F304", "B00E9E4F68", "B0062VL4XS", "B00AEFXIQE", "B00E3QJ7FG", "B00CXY9WIM", "B00H7KJTCG", "B004ZJZQ1A", "B00DYEN6XC", "B00HWWUQYY", "B007Q1GJA6", "B000MEYFXW", "B00AEBBAEA", "B00AEFXJNQ", "B001G5T6GC", "B00JL6L4WC", "B00H83EV5W", "B00COHGPQA", "B008V5UQZK", "B003IWZ750", "B008JFUR10", "B008MIMWOO", "B00AEBBAF4", "B004TJ1H0A", "B004047XWU", "B006WZIETG", "B005KQVDH8", "B002ZG97WO", "B0014DFCMS", "B00267QOEQ", "B0021L9ME6", "B001O7JHW0", "B001IKKMD6", "B00AEFXDGE", "B0090SI582", "B004RQDPBE", "B0014BQQZM", "B001KZVQJI", "B0082JRF7C", "B001KEHAHQ", "B000J4P9PI", "B0029XFN8A", "B00CTSDDVO", "B001CW7ZUS", "B00COHGORU", "B00HERGM86", "B0093LE2OC", "B0047685I2", "B00BLN4UDI", "B004RQDYXI", "B00DHHWY9I"], "bought_together": ["B00H47IXTC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001JNNDE2", "B0082JRF7C", "B0054OGQOQ", "B005ERX1UU"]}, "price": 19.95, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 149245}, "asin": "B000HDZK1Y", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51sDOKT8e4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Nacho Libre [Blu-ray]"}

{"description": "Even the many detractors of long-running sitcomMarried with Childrenhave to admit that sustaining such a superlative level of crass, cynical bile for so long is a artistic feat. The Bundy family--defeated father Al (Ed O'Neill,The Bone Collector), frustrated mother Peg (Katey Sagal,8 Simple Rules), even more frustrated son Bud (David Faustino,Pucked), and slutty, dimwitted daughter Kelly (Christina Applegate,Anchorman)--savaged every earnest cliche imaginable about family affection as they clawed and fought for any scrap of food, money, respect, or dignity in their squalid lives.  The cast completely understood the show's humor and bit into every vicious jab with zest.The sixth season of this satirical show was controversial among fans.  While some episodes are hugely popular (including a two-parter in which Kelly's public-access tv show becomes a hit, when Bud becomes faux-rapper Grandmaster B, or when Peg and Al's anniversary includes a visit from the speed metal band Anthrax), the storyline about Peg becoming pregnant (which ended abruptly when Sagal had a miscarriage in real life) and the season-ending three-parter about the Bundys going to England were criticized as desperate and pandering. But watchingMarried with Childrenon dvd makes those accusations seem beside the point. Even in its most cartoonish episodes, the show tossed off brutally bitter jokes that upturned our culture's sacred cows, spat in the face of both the priggish and the politically correct, and will make devoted viewers cackle with glee. As American culture grows more and more timid,Married with Childrenglows more brightly. Guest stars include former porn star Traci Lords, Jon Lovitz (The Critic), Fred Willard (Best In Show), and a pre-FriendsMatt LeBlanc.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000FBH3WM", "B000SSQ7J2", "B00127RAFS", "B0009YCLBS", "B001OXLGIM", "B001APMD1I", "B002FU8JTM", "B0006J27WY", "B00000F5W8", "B0000C9JFQ", "B00I099JYQ", "B00GOC74YI", "B00I458456", "B00GLT2SOA", "B00A33J8FM", "B00005JOHC", "B0007WQHFS", "B000A0GOQ4", "B000BNTM46", "B007C8RZYC", "B0007WFXL2", "B0001CCXCA", "B008L0YMZA", "B000068V9X", "B00BB8LU5Y", "B00B04NJ12", "B00007KK56", "B00008AOX6", "B00070HK4C", "B00DD56724", "B00JDCP0QA", "B0006IUDYY", "B0015ODSK4", "B0006N2EZK", "B0019F02W6", "B008L0YMUK", "B000F6ZIIS", "B005CGI4EG", "B000957O8C", "B000H1RFXM", "B00005Y1NF", "B00317LM8S", "B0007OCG74", "B006MFQ4DE", "B0013XZ71K", "B007C8RZL0", "B000067FP8", "B00GOC74QG", "B004D2GMVM", "B0006BAWSI", "B002GSXKOC", "B00B04NII6", "B0025KVNOU", "B00A2XQU7M", "B0006Q93BU", "B00005U14H", "B000RXZL0E", "B001L1S1R6", "B000062XFG", "B0007R4SWC", "B000FBH3WC", "B000FTC1GW", "B000B5XOTS", "B00008R9MC", "B00BM2JVAA", "B0058J3S16", "B00DJYK1XU", "B00B04NIOU", "B000T22PVG", "B000MX7V5W", "B007C8RZXS", "B00B04NJ1M", "B0072BNJ0I", "B0007Y08JW", "B007C8RZR4", "B00BUWD7SO", "B001MVYUSO", "B0006Z2L2Y", "B0001NBNIY", "B000B5XOUC", "B0008JIJ1K", "B000A7PKGW", "B002E58FTW", "B000A59PM4", "B002E58FUG", "B0001O3YHQ", "B004916TPG", "B000FI8MQG", "B000DZ95IU", "B0058JEI06", "B000VDDE0Y", "B00005JM3G", "B001E6JC26", "B00DXLO0BI", "B0007PAM06", "B003KSO3QG", "B00A2XQTF0", "B002YOKVUE", "B008F283WW", "B0058EE6NK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000FBH3WM", "B0006J27WY", "B002FU8JTM", "B005CGI4EG"]}, "price": 1.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 118169}, "asin": "B000JBWWQK", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51WA8Md04TL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Married... with Children: Season 6"}

{"description": "The feverish spectacle of a summer camp for evangelical Christian kids is the focus ofJesus Camp, a fascinating if sometimes alarming documentary. (Shortly after its release, the movie gained a new notoriety when Ted Haggard, president of the National Association of Evangelicals, who appears near the end of the film, resigned his post amid a male prostitute's allegations of drug use and sexual misconduct.) For most of the film, we follow a charismatic teacher, Becky Fischer, as she trains young soldiers in \"God's Army\" at a camp in North Dakota. Some of the kids emerge as likable and bright, and eager to continue their work as pint-sized preachers; elsewhere, the visions of children speaking in tongues and falling to the floor in ecstasy are more troubling. Even more arresting is the vision of a generation of children home-schooled to believe that the Bible is science, or Fischer's certainty that America's flawed system of democracy will someday be replaced by a theocracy. (In one scene, a cardboard cut-out of George W. Bush is presented to the children, who react by laying their hands on the figure as though in a religious procession.) Filmmakers Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady maintain neutrality about all this, maybe too much so (they throw in some interviews with radio host Mike Papantonio to provide a liberal-Christian viewpoint) and one would like to know more about the grown-ups presented here. Power broker Haggard is the creepiest person in the film, an insincere smooth talker whose advice to one of the young would-be campgoers comes across as entirely cynical. Time will tell whether the film's Christian soldiers will be marching onward.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000NIVJH2", "B001MFNB5I", "B000CAPZBC", "B000CCW2VG", "B001J21JRQ", "B00KY6YAO2", "B00008DDVV", "B001GCUO02", "B002I9Z8EO", "B0001NBNDY", "B001BEK8FQ", "B0010YSD7M", "B0000ACOXL", "B000092T6A", "B0000WN13Q", "B000UNYK4E", "B001M564BQ", "B000F48D78", "B000KX0IOA", "B003YJENZM", "0615509584", "B000C3L2IO", "B000T5MP72", "B002Z9JJXS", "B000ICL3KG", "B003ASLJQI", "B00005JN0T", "B001FACH7S", "B00DT55ORM", "B000AYEIY0", "B00AOCDEDY", "0988245108", "B0007WFYBG", "B001DWNUD8", "1939578191", "149217744X", "B008PZ69SE", "B000UNYJXQ", "B00470MG06", "B006TTC5MM", "B001E5FYS8", "B00009YXAS", "B000YHQNCI", "B000E5LEVU", "0767805712", "B000BMY2NS", "B003Q6D28C", "B00094AS72", "B0000SXK0Y", "1456588850", "B002HSD0J6", "B00007GVM0", "B00028HBIO", "B00A4TMLKE", "B002SAMMME", "B00005KHJY", "6305257442", "B00EL6AAEU", "B004CJQVQC", "B001DPHDA6", "B004EPYZPS", "1616141689", "B00F98FORM", "B00G3DA63Y", "B009MBSWUS", "B005LAIIHG", "B0047UJBP4", "0615927904", "B00BX49B6G", "B00005JKCH", "B00008RH3J", "B0030Y11XS", "B000BTH4K4", "B00006673L", "0767837991", "B000MTFFUO", "0783225733", "B000FBH3W2", "B00G0PXU2Y", "B0041KKYBA", "B000060MW1", "B00003CWN3", "B000XQ4HR8", "0393061027", "B000U6YJLU", "0231139624", "1478716568", "B001GMZGMI", "B00008DDJ6", "0143116649", "B000YY6VIC", "B001HZ30O0", "023033895X", "0671203231", "B00FGVRZT2", "B00094AS6I", "B0000DIJOO", "0195141830", "B001EDFSIQ", "B000A2XCBC"], "bought_together": ["B001MFNB5I"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001MFNB5I", "B000CCW2VG", "B000NIVJH2", "B001J21JRQ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 106626}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.83, "brand": "MAGNOLIA HOME ENTERTAINMENT", "asin": "B000KLQUV2", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510JRNQD6DL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Jesus Camp"}
{"description": "Outstanding animation and a compelling environmental message makeOrigin: Spirits of the Pastan above-average anime feature, especially for younger viewers. Despite an abundance of elements that many anime fans will find familiar,Origindistinguishes itself with a story that lends itself (like many anime features) to a variety of spectacular settings. As the fairy-tale story begins, it's been 300 years since terrible events left civilization in ruins. Now, in a post-apocalyptic setting where the crumbling remains of vast cities lie in close proximity to the encroaching forest, humans live on both sides of a brewing conflict. For young Agito, the son of an aging hero, life is relatively peaceful in Neutral City, a community built within the ruins of a once-major city. But when he wanders into a forbidden zone of the forest, where plant-like \"druids\" protect their world from outsiders, he discovers a cryogenic stasis tube containing Toola, a girl who's been resting in stasis for 300 years.

{"description": "Zhang Yimou's heartfelt feature about cultural displacement, grief, and reconciliation is a lovely and somewhat unexpected work from the director ofRaise the Red LanternandHouse of Flying Daggers. Japanese actor Ken Takakura stars as Gou-ichi Takata, a laconic man who lives in a fishing village and is estranged from his son. When word reaches him that his son is ill with cancer, Takata travels to Tokyo but is turned away. Takata learns that his son has a passion for rural Chinese folk opera, and he flies to mainland China to locate Li Jiamin (playing himself), an opera star who happens to be in jail at the moment. Takata's story reminds Li of his own sad disconnection from his young son, and Takata sets out to restore their relationship as a prelude to helping his own with Li's help. Zhang himself is unusually operatic here, with intense emotions flying around, prettified visions of nature, and characters--including prison guards and peasants--who seem idealized, both as folklore and even old, Maoist notions of cooperation. Zhang's longtime admirers will appreciate and understand this change of pace from a filmmaker whose relationship with Chinese officials has often been strained over content. But film fans less familiar with his body of work will enjoyRiding Aloneas well. --Tom KeoghStills fromRiding Alone for Thousands of Miles(click for larger image)MoreRiding Alone for Thousands of Mileson Amazon.comMore Films by Yimou ZhangMore Films Starring Ken TakakuraMore Films from China", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000C2IW7", "B000F1IO02", "B00005QFE5", "0767853512", "B00006RCL3", "B000AYELXI", "B000GDH9J6", "B000067IX5", "B000EAT23M", "B00005N5RN", "B001BHTNAY", "B00005JM6H", "B005B0QYSQ", "B0060KGSGO", "6305460183", "B00007JZVS", "B001CCY42U", "B000PMFS6O", "B0019Z3P5W", "B0007Q6VXC", "B0006FFRB6", "B000W0H5GA", "B00HQFA1VA", "B004SIP88Y", "B006MWA91A", "B005KG4CUS", "B004DMIJ0E", "B00104AYGK", "B000C8ST80", "B00004VVO5", "B00AIBZLHS", "B00008HCCI", "B00AN5LCXQ", "B000KHX70S", "B009DAYI8S", "B00003CXR4", "B002U4F5W2", "B00003CXUM", "B004WJT5G0", "B000GIXE86", "B0087OULO6", "B002SF9YNO", "B000EZ7ZYK", "B00005KCB5", "B006H3KQSK", "B006IW8E3Y", "B0002V7S34", "B0007WQHO4", "B000ARXF96", "B00BC1UPRO", "B000GBEWPC", "B00116VG3M", "B00065GX0K", "B004CGUBZW", "B007SLF9ZA", "B0009XRZQK", "B000LXHK0E", "B00005JKG1", "B001CD6GL6", "0393328597", "B000059TON", "B00005YRQ2", "6305428557", "B000025RE7", "B00ET2ODYY", "B000811672", "0385722206", "B004M9ZI0M", "B0009P7EI2", "B000EHRVMY", "B00005UM27", "B002QMV13U", "630342063X", "B000BJG1NU", "B000ASDFYK", "B001H5ZQHY", "B004Y5R0E6", "B003N4XCTQ"], "bought_together": ["B0000C2IW7", "B000F1IO02"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000F1IO02", "B00005QFE5", "B0000C2IW7", "0767853512"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 177782}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.5, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B000KX0IPE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51qvVHSTQLL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Riding Alone For Thousands of Miles"}
{"description": "In his aim to make an honest film about sex, John Cameron Mitchell (Hedwig and the Angry Inch) has taken a somewhat documentary approach toShortbus, a film describing various New Yorkers' sexual pathos. Framed by shots roving a homemade diorama of the city,Shortbusis comprised of vignettes featuring actors who helped craft this story of people's disconnect in sexual endeavors. Jamie (PJ DeBoy) and James (Paul Dawson), a gay couple experiencing a lull in their relationship, visit Sophia (Sook-Yin Lee), a sex therapist whose inability to orgasm results in her clients inviting her to a sex club after which the film is titled. Sophia's husband, Rob (Raphael Barker), is also willing to experiment, so the two independently embark on adventures in self-pleasure. Dominatrix Severin (Lindsay Beamish) plays a crucial role in Sophia and Rob's lives, as her search for real humanity overlaps with their desire for passion. As each character's plot complicates, the viewer sees a similar melancholy bulldozing its way into these seemingly disparate lives. The depression is repeatedly used in comedic scenes, such as when James is asked on a date while still hospitalized for his attempted suicide. Yo La Tengo's score, which includes Animal Collective among others, lends this film a graceful ambience. Unlike porn,Shortbushas a resonance that encourages the viewer to consider one's own sex life as an important aspect of happiness.--Trinie Dalton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001AZKB8K", "B000BGH29K", "B003B2UK1S", "B00003JRAV", "B00005QW5X", "B0009VRHLK", "B000FZEQCS", "B0015FHDWM", "B00069A6CC", "B00GHP8SH4", "B000L6S92E", "B00HHYF5EI", "B00INUK5WM", "B000DZ95MG", "B00023P4I8", "B00996RSYM", "B00HW3F1IO", "B00GWWV1XU", "B00JJRLG7G", "B003XKNGNW", "B0076ANKUY", "B00I4CWIVU", "B00JVQ7QTM", "B00AWQEK26", "B0000BWVD9", "B00BJSLNN0", "B0084BM7NK", "B0007TZHWA", "B0009WDVUK", "B002R3CQDC", "B00KI1VXT8", "B0007OCG5G", "B00F98FOPE", "B00HQKREFG", "B00I567EWS", "B004GBMVTW", "B00064AFF0", "B004L03B3S", "B005GM38MO", "B00GSA3K6C", "B001PYD0LQ", "B00I2U91Z0", "B00368PSNC", "B0013D8LCW", "B00E849QSG", "B002L1YGRY", "B0080JX4Y2", "B00F878KAC", "B00HUTPKA4", "B0083V2VYG", "B00GPPXNIK", "B00IJZMZW4", "B00AZAJXOE", "B0002JZT5A", "B002JCYSL4", "B00IA7MFEO", "B00JVQ7PWU", "B0004Z32NI", "B000059XTM", "B00177Y9TS", "B00B022GVS", "B001RVQPPU", "B00HLTYRUM", "B00DUJH8V2", "B00JDOQMH4", "B0002I84JO", "B00099415C", "0780629167", "B000UYBP7S", "B0042L0OG8", "B001R4KAI0", "B00KRFE9UK", "B000ETRCMQ", "0783230559", "B00C8CQ5SO", "B00JDOQMIS", "B008N25X7M", "B000NVT0UM", "B00008UALE", "B008JFX04G", "B00J925RX0", "B00FGG60XY", "B00FPVGWY2", "B00AKLLSNC", "B000U95N9E", "B00F2RNAUI", "B005TIK4SQ", "0780022823", "B00005JMIJ", "B000AYELEC", "B00IMFRKIU", "B00AY6PK5A", "B009SFR2QI", "B005OTQIK8", "B00003CY27", "B002T4GY4Q"], "bought_together": ["B001AZKB8K", "B000BGH29K"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001AZKB8K", "B00003JRAV", "B000BGH29K", "B00GPPXNIK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 20842}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 39.0, "brand": "THINKFILM LLC", "asin": "B000LAZDQA", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61q20cKX4vL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Shortbus (Unrated Edition)"}

{"description": "A feel-good movie that highlights the beauty of France as much as it does its stars,A Good Yearprovides a languid, gorgeous viewing experience. Director Ridley Scott and Russell Crowe--who first worked together on the Academy Award-winningGladiator--are reunited in this romantic film, which is based on Peter Mayle's bookA Year in Provence. Crowe plays Max, a workaholic London bonds trader who doesn't know the meaning of vacation. When his uncle dies, leaving him a picturesque estate in the south of France, Max views it as an opportunity to cash in the vinery and pocket the profits. The film is reminiscent of Diane Lane'sUnder the Tuscan Sunin the way the scenery plays as much of a role in the film as its characters. The lush village and streaming sunlight portray Provence as an idyllic, magical place. Even Max falls under its spell. While not a particularly likeable character, especially in the early part of the film, Max also isn't a bad guy. When he gets the chance to live life at a less manic pace than which he is used to, he finds that a good year isn't dependant on a financial windfall. Though Scott tries to drum up some suspense in the film (Is the beautiful visitor really Max's illegitimate cousin? Will Max fall in love with the feisty local woman he trades quips with?) nothing that happens comes as much of a surprise. Still, while the film doesn't fully utilize Crowe's range of skills, the actor is charming in his role andA Good Yearprovides a fine time in the cinemas. --Jae-Ha KimExtras fromA Good YearRussell Crowe and Co-Stars on Filming in ProvenceA Good YearVirtual VinyardBeyondA Good YearA Year in ProvenceMore from Director Ridley ScottMore from Russell CroweStills fromA Good Year", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001LPWGBY", "B0007TKOAA", "B0000VD02Y", "B000JBWWBK", "B000C8STWQ", "B00D7HBV10", "B00EZC8042", "B004SIP6BI", "B00006ZXSI", "B00008G7UF", "B0000CE684", "B00005BCKF", "B00BVMXCRY", "0375705627", "B007JNR54A", "B002DU39GW", "B00F878KE8", "B003B3V0W0", "B002ZG988M", "B00AEBB8YW", "B003U0AHBO", "0679731148", "B0001HLVS2", "B0009OL7Z4", "B004SIP7D0", "B0042816YK", "B00003CWRX", "B00005JPSM", "B00006ZXSO", "B001N44BVQ", "B00004Y7Y4", "B00005NKCN", "B000F3UAFC", "0394572300", "0743297326", "B00006ADD5", "B000023VTP", "B000ARTN3I", "B000085OXZ", "B001CIOCLC", "630560097X", "B00008G7UL", "B000MQC9H4", "B006DHAT5K", "B003PIUIJC", "B003L20IG0", "0375405917", "B00003CWUX", "B000YAA68C", "B00005JMIJ", "B006TTC540", "B000OPOAJS", "B00005JKKY", "B001DB6J6Y", "B00012QLB4", "B001THZAAI", "B005MYEQ4U", "B0006A9FIM", "B000BNX3B4", "B000085OY1", "B008H1Q3QY", "B00AZMFO6I", "B005MYEPXC", "B00C888MJ8", "B002ZG989G", "B00CIOD6HK", "B00000JGHK", "B00AEBB8SS", "B0001DCYUU", "B00003CXXG", "B005S9EJ14", "B00AEFXIIW", "B002U4UYZA", "6305692696", "0783230079", "B000EMGJ7C", "B00005JPX8", "B002ZG988W", "B009SH5JS4", "B000HEWEE4", "B00AEFYK5M", "B00005TNEQ", "B001C5LLQ4", "B002K0WBXW", "B00006ZXSN", "6305428034", "B001ECDVK4", "B004SIP8JI", "B0000AOV4I", "B000XR9L50", "B000XT1P3E", "B0038N9X3Q", "B002ZG97B0", "B004L3AR0K", "B00DL48BM6", "B00GSBMNOQ", "B000067FP2", "B000CCW2P2", "B005HWAOP2", "B008N8A3JE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003B3V0W0", "B001LPWGBY", "B00006ZXSI", "B0000VD02Y"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 85244}, "asin": "B000LXHK22", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DLfytc0cL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "A Good Year (Full-Screen Edition)"}
{"description": "Brilliantly conceived, superbly directed, and beautifully acted,Babelis inarguably one of the best films of 2006. Director Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu and his co-writer, Guillermo Arriaga (the two also collaborated onAmores Perrosand21 Grams) weave together the disparate strands of their story into a finely hewn fabric by focusing on what appear to be several equally incongruent characters: an American (Brad Pitt) touring Morocco with his wife (Cate Blanchett) become the focus of an international incident also involving a hardscrabble Moroccan farmer (Mustapha Rachidi) struggling to keep his two young sons in line and his family together. A San Diego nanny (Adriana Barraza), her employers absent, makes the disastrous decision to take their kids with her to a wedding in Mexico. And a deaf-mute Japanese teen (the extraordinary Rinko Kikuchi) deals with a relationship with her father (Koji Yakusho) and the world in general that's been upended by the death of her mother. It is perhaps not surprising, or particularly original, that a gun is the device that ties these people together. YetBabelisn't merely about violence and its tragic consequences. It's about communication, and especially the lack of it--both intercultural, raising issues like terrorism and immigration, and intracultural, as basic as husbands talking to their wives and parents understanding their children. I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu's command of his medium, sound and visual alike, is extraordinary; the camera work is by turns kinetic and restrained, the music always well matched to the scenes, the editing deft but not confusing, and the film (which clocks in at a lengthy 143 minutes) is filled with indelible moments. Many of those moments are also pretty stark and grim, and no will claim that all of this leads to a \"happy\" ending, but there is a sense of reconciliation, perhaps even resolution. \"If You Want to be Understood... Listen,\" goes the tagline. And if you want a movie that will leave you thinking,Babelis it.--Sam GrahamBeyondBabelOther Interweaving Storylines on DVDOther DVDs by Director Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rrituWhy We Love Cate BlanchettStills fromBabel(click for larger image)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0001CNRRU", "B00005N8A9", "B0041KKYF6", "B000A3XY5A", "B000F7CMRM", "B000067IZ3", "B00005JL57", "B00AEFXESQ", "B001P9KR8U", "B000N6TX1I", "B001JIE7JC", "B00005JPKE", "B00AEFXQ9S", "B00005JMJ4", "B0010DR4BO", "B000NIVJF4", "B000NIVJFY", "B000F1IQN2", "B00HF98SPS", "B0045ZAQRS", "B00011CZRE", "B000N3T0DW", "B002O3Z4Z2", "B000MZHW40", "B004SIP6VI", "B0034G4P30", "B008JFUNKU", "B003ASLJQS", "B000E1NXJ0", "B004SIP6GI", "B00AEBB89W", "B00275EGWY", "B000IONJM4", "B00H9KKGTO", "B00003CWTI", "B00080Z53O", "B00005JNCZ", "B00114XTHA", "B00GUO2SKA", "B00112S8RS", "B001PPLJIQ", "B000MXPE7O", "B00102F5WK", "B00121QGPY", "B0016Q2D66", "B002J1RZHE", "B008220DGE", "B000O76ZQC", "B0013XZ6X4", "B00080ZG10", "B00337KM2S", "B000286RP2", "B004SIP8ZM", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00005JMJG", "B00005Q4CS", "B00AEBB9CS", "B00G4Q3KOC", "B0036TGSJE", "B001TOD92C", "B000OY8NBK", "B004XVMCKS", "B00GMV8M2Y", "B00005JLRE", "B00005JH9M", "B00004WG2F", "B00AEBB8SS", "B00005JKJA", "B00H9HZITU", "B000YENUI6", "B0041KKYDI", "B001MZ5W3M", "B000N3SU92", "B000EQHXNW", "B0041KKYEM", "B001LLH8SE", "B0007TKOAA", "B000P0J0BK", "B002S5N052", "B004SIP7S0", "B00AEBB8NI", "B002SJIO4A", "B000CQLZ0Q", "B000E33VWW", "B000M341QE", "B002VWNICC", "B001NFNFNU", "6305313687", "B00005JKTF", "B00FZ4KR4U", "B00008K7AO", "B00DL48BM6", "079073639X", "B00H83EUQW", "B000FVQLRA", "B0002TT0MI", "B00AHTYI5M", "B00H9L26AA", "B00003CWRX", "B002FHGESI"], "bought_together": ["B00005N8A9", "B0041KKYF6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000A3XY5A", "B0001CNRRU", "B0041KKYF6", "B00G4Q3KOC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 100262}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.22, "brand": "Paramount Home Video", "asin": "B000MCH5P4", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51poif023LL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Babel"}
