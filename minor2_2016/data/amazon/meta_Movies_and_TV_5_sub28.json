{"description": "You know that old dramatic principle of suspension of disbelief? You'll have to rely on it for this box-office smash, but you won't be disappointed. Harrison Ford plays a U.S. president who single-handedly employs his rigid antiterrorism policy when a band of Russian thugs hatch a mid-flight takeover of Air Force One. Gary Oldman, who chews the scenery as the lead terrorist, will shoot a hostage at the slightest provocation. Glenn Close plays the sternly pragmatic vice president who negotiates with Oldman from her Washington seat of power. If you can believe that the aircraft's pressurized cabin can sustain hundreds of rounds of machine-gun fire, you'll buy anything in this entertaining potboiler, especially thanks to Ford's stalwart heroics and some nifty special effects.

{"description": "Arguably the most intelligently written film to feature the masterful stop-motion animation of Ray Harryhausen,Jason and the Argonautsis a colorful adventure that takes full advantage of Harryhausen's \"Dynarama\" process. Inspired by the Greek myth, the story begins when the fearless explorer Jason (Todd Armstrong) returns to the kingdom of Thessaly to make his rightful claim to the throne, but the gods proclaim that he must first find the magical Golden Fleece. Consulting Hera, the queen of gods, Jason recruits the brave Argonauts to crew his ship, and they embark on their eventful journey. Along the way they encounter a variety of mythic creatures, including the 100-foot bronze god Talos, the batlike Harpies, the seven-headed reptilian Hydra, and an army of skeletons wielding sword and shield. This last sequence remains one of the finest that Harryhausen ever created, and it's still as thrilling as anything from the age of digital special effects. Harryhausen was the true auteur of his fantasy films, and his brilliant animation evokes a timeless sense of wonder.Jason and the Argonautsis a prime showcase for Harryhausen's talent--a wondrous product of pure imagination and filmmaking ingenuity.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001DB6J50", "0767847431", "B00004TJJV", "B002ZD3V10", "B00006JDRG", "B000062XE5", "B001DZOCY6", "B000QGEB1W", "B00007JMD8", "B00018D3ZA", "B00005LKHN", "B0045HCJSA", "B003DVNUUK", "B00005Y6XR", "B000SAGGL4", "B00005JKU0", "B000095WW6", "B00006AUGK", "B008XTVWHK", "B004B93RDS", "B0037JO0X4", "B000SFJ4K4", "B000FOPPEC", "B00AEBB8VK", "B0001BKBFC", "B000BMY2KG", "B0007R4T1W", "B00005JKFR", "B000VULA94", "B000AQKU72", "B0024FADBK", "B000O78KWE", "B0044O1Q60", "B000062XF2", "B0001NBMDK", "B000B7MX7A", "B000063UR0", "B00ALTQRUC", "B000HEWEDK", "B001BGS17Q", "B005OT7YX8", "B00004TJK0", "B005E7SFDI", "B000056AXZ", "B00007ELD2", "0783240961", "B000EHQTZO", "B00152VXUS", "B00005R1O8", "0783240953", "B000YDOOHI", "B00A33J8R0", "B00009NHC0", "B0024LIBDQ", "B00518A70E", "B0007R4T26", "B000A6T1ZE", "B0074JOUHE", "B0001I55XI", "B00D9EJFZA", "B002945DU2", "B000O78KY2", "B000Y2Q9J0", "B00AEBB94G", "B00005RRG7", "B0006B2A7E", "B00005JMH8", "B0045HCJKS", "6305869367", "B000FVQLKW", "B0006GANX2", "B000MGTQ7U", "6305761078", "B000056NWI", "B000AYELJ2", "B001AR0D40", "B005R2SHIS", "B00094ARW8", "B00A33J90G", "B000A9QK7I", "B00BQ7GU1Y", "B006TTC5J0", "B004FZWDPG", "B0002KPHW4", "0790742829", "B00B2M7DKA", "B004QF71ZW", "B0024FAG2G", "B00005JN8Z", "B00000F17E", "B003L7DK60", "B00006JMQG"], "bought_together": ["B001DB6J50", "0767847431"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001DB6J50", "0767847431", "B00004TJJV", "B002ZD3V10"]}, "price": 29.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 12182}, "asin": "0767810864", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51WNMTYA9qL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Jason and the Argonauts"}
{"description": "In the first and finestRoboCopmovie, director Paul Verhoeven combined near-future science fiction with a keen sense of social satire--not to mention enough high-velocity violence to satisfy even the most voracious bloodlust. InStarship Troopers, Verhoeven andRoboCopcowriter Ed Neumeier take inspired cues from Robert Heinlein's classic sci-fi novel to create a special-effects extravaganza that functions on multiple levels of entertainment. The film might be called &quot;Melrose Place in Space,&quot; with its youthful cast of handsome guys and gorgeous women who look like they've been recruited (and in some cases they were) from the cast ofBeverly Hills 90210. Viewers might focus on the incredible, graphically intense action sequences (definitelynotfor children) in which heavily armed forces from Earth go to off-world battle against vast hordes of alien &quot;bugs&quot; bent on planetary conquest. The attacking bugs are marvels of state-of-the-art special-effects technology, and the space battles are nothing short of spectacular. ButStarship Troopersis more than a showcase for high-tech hardware and gigantic, flesh-ripping insects.  Recalling his childhood in Holland during the Nazi occupation, Verhoeven turns this epic adventure into a scathingly funny satire of fascist propaganda, emphasizing Heinlein's underlying warning against the hazards of military conformity and the sickening realities of war. It's an action-packed joy ride if that's all you're looking for, but Verhoeven has a provocative agenda that makesStarship Troopersas smart as it is exciting. The DVD includes an above-average commentary by the director and Neumeier, several deleted scenes, a behind-the-scenes documentary and promotional featurette, cast bios, production notes, and more.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0018CWWA0", "B0001XAOQ6", "B0088X7YMS", "B00D3LA7G0", "B00005N7Z1", "B00070FX5U", "0800195175", "B001ECDVKE", "B00005JA8B", "B00004Y87O", "B0000844I8", "B00008G8LY", "B004P7CN5O", "0441783589", "B00008G8M4", "0780622650", "B00003L9CQ", "B004P7CN7W", "B001JFZ118", "B003XURDAY", "B00I9TDMRM", "B001ILHY1I", "B0002CHK1S", "B00IMYVCGW", "B00000ILDD", "B009YQJ322", "B00000G3PA", "0767817478", "B0088X7YU0", "079284646X", "B000068MC3", "B000P0J09C", "B007STBUHI", "B007D5E7C2", "B004L9GMBC", "B002NZK5U0", "B00026ZG10", "B0045HCJ0S", "B00E8G5HQE", "B00009ATIX", "0783227434", "0780619951", "B000QXDED6", "B00D7AM6M0", "B00006JDVV", "B00AEFY3MC", "B00AEBB8FQ", "B0085A9J18", "B0000959N0", "B004P7CMOQ", "B00005JLQN", "B000RW3VCK", "B0004Z33G4", "B0000UJL96", "B0009JE6G6", "B000JJ4DNW", "B00005JM5B", "B000035Z38", "0767802454", "B0009MDPYM", "B005LAIH54", "B0000AOX0F", "B000VR0570", "B00AEFYDM2", "B00AEFXW8I", "0767802519", "6304711891", "B005G4TJUC", "B00AKGG828", "6305869103", "B0015RCUR8", "B000P0J0AQ", "B008CYDD7I", "0783226837", "B004SIP9Z6", "B002GHHHL0", "B0001VTPW2", "B0009X76XC", "B003J42JLC", "B00003CY6P", "B00000J11D", "B001KKU9DW", "B00AEBB9SM", "B006ZGROB6", "B00AEFXPMG", "1558908846", "B0002V7OI8", "B001VLFE7G", "B0087ZG7HK", "B0000A2ZU1", "B000A5045Q", "B008JFUQZ2", "0800141822", "B000096IAC", "B002ZG98C8", "B001B3LIOC", "B0068FZ0O2", "B000NQRR1G", "B008JFUN50"], "bought_together": ["B0018CWWA0", "B0001XAOQ6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0018CWW9G", "B0088X7YMS", "B00070FX5U", "B0090SI56Y"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 183809}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.55, "brand": "Sony Pictures Home Entertainment", "asin": "0767802659", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51967mHEbrL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Starship Troopers"}
{"description": "Film buffs and critics can argue until their faces turn blue about whether this lavish Dickensian musical deserved the Academy Award for Best Picture of 1968, but the movie speaks for itself on grandly entertaining terms. Adapted from Dickens's classic novel, it's one of the most dramatically involving and artistically impressive musicals of the 1960s, directed by Carol Reed with a delightful enthusiasm that would surely have impressed Dickens himself. Mark Lester plays the waifish orphan Oliver Twist, who is befriended by the pickpocketing Artful Dodger (Jack Wild) and recruited into the gang of boy thieves led by Fagin (played to perfection by Ron Moody). The villainous Bill Sikes (Oliver Reed) casts his long shadow over Oliver and his friends, but the young orphan is still able to find loving care in the most desperate of circumstances. Full of memorable melodies and splendid lyrics,Oliver!is a timeless film, prompting even hard-to-please critic Pauline Kael to call it \"a superb demonstration of intelligent craftsmanship,\" and to further observe that \"it's as if the movie set out to be a tribute to Dickens and his melodramatic art as well as to tell the story of Oliver Twist.\"--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B0000VCZKM", "B000RPCK2E", "B005NFJAZS", "B00G9EOQ8I", "B0001I55TC", "B00000F17A", "B000026FAZ", "B001J4E1CY", "B000002W8R", "B002HK9IDQ", "B000BITV92", "B0000AM6IY", "0780021312", "B000HT3PGU", "B0001WTUJE", "B0045HCJJY", "B00D3K357O", "B0006HBV3W", "B00005JL1P", "B00012FXJ0", "B007P7UF0G", "B00004TVUD", "B00AATV0WS", "B000BYA4HE", "B001PO550A", "B000002SLN", "0792839749", "B0090XLDKY", "6305320802", "B00005AUKE", "B003BZXIA0", "B00AEFY6DI", "B000KJTGHO", "0767827651", "B0007Z0O9U", "B0001US8F8", "B009Z59782", "B00011D1OK", "B00005MEOU", "B0045HCJQM", "B0007939PW", "B000HT3PGK", "B000AP04OM", "B0000549B1", "B001PO54V0", "B001GLX6TY", "B000VKL6RK", "B00004XMTJ", "B000025BD5", "B0009S4IKQ", "B000BT970O", "B000LPR6GA", "B00006RCO3", "B000XJD34I", "B000TPTCP0", "B009NYF2GQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0000VCZKM", "B00E9ZATKI", "B000RPCK2E", "B005NFJAZS"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 371247}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 10.0, "brand": "", "asin": "0767812417", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/517WF2e1VhL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "OLIVER! 30th Tribute Edition"}
{"description": "If anyone ever doubts whether Nicole Kidman is a good actress, they should immediately be required to watch this outrageously wicked comedy from 1995, for which Kidman deservedly won a Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Leading Role. While director Gus Van Sant handles the fact-based satire with razor-sharp precision, Kidman delivers a deliciously devious performance as Suzanne Stone, a small-town New Hampshire housewife who fancies herself the next Barbara Walters, Jane Pauley, Diane Sawyer, and Maria Shriver all rolled up into one meticulously coiffed package. So determined is she to have a successful career on TV that she'll stop at nothing--even the calculated murder of her husband (Matt Dillon)--to get the attention she feels entitled to. To carry out her scheme she recruits some unwitting local teenagers including one boy (Joaquin Phoenix, matching Kidman's excellence) whose infatuation with Suzanne leads to sexual escapades and predictably troublesome consequences. It's a satirical comedy in Van Sant's capable hands, but it's so close to tabloid reality that the film never seems implausible--which only gives it a funnier, more blood-chilling quality of humor. Featuring Illeanna Douglas, George Segal, andSeinfeldalumnus Wayne Knight in memorable supporting roles, this is one of the best comedies of the '90s--especially if you prefer comedies with a decidedly darker edge.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305161933", "B004AE3QYE", "B004P7CMUU", "B006YTGLE0", "B000067J3P", "B00005JNQA", "B0007P0X9G", "B0002DB52M", "B009R8Q8Y8", "6305594333", "B000NO1XG8", "B00006L91I", "B00004Y87P", "B0013D8LKO", "B00AEFYUQQ", "B0001GF2D8", "B004SUDQ0O", "B0002W4UDE", "B009B1EPQ4", "B001RJ1Y62", "B00005QJJB", "B000068QPV", "B00AEFXX9Q", "0767821009", "6305308837", "B0043X1FNQ", "B000HC2LHG", "B00441GYZ6", "B00005JMIJ", "B000E5N684", "B006YTGL3G", "B0001EFUFK", "B00827OWO8", "B0011NVC8Y", "0767812158", "B00HQLZC18", "0792845811", "B00005JKJA", "B00AEFYD2M", "B00AEFY8MM", "B0000542CB", "B00011CZRE", "B00007AJFB", "B0045HCIYA", "B00AEBB8ZG", "B000H5TH1Q", "B005DR64OQ", "B00BSN0VZW", "B004SIP92O", "B004SIP86Q", "B0021L9M2I", "B004SUDQC2", "B000HT38EO", "B00GNZM0D6", "B004SIP6QI", "6305213305", "0780627776", "B00008L3UE", "B00JVQ7QTM", "B0007R4SX6", "B00GUO2SKA", "B00AEBB9LO", "B000BOH904", "B00006472O", "B00AEBB8SS", "B00AEFXBPM", "B00E1HIWXU", "B004O26LAI", "B003AWRM9M", "B008220DGE", "B00003CWN3", "0767815718", "0784011710", "B000U1ZV76", "B000PAAJZ6", "6305428107", "B00005JLHW", "B00JJ3EHCG", "B003LR5BD0", "B00H9HZITU", "6305161895", "B000ASDFGI", "B00H83EUQW", "B0003JANWS", "B004ALIG4W", "B0010KP360", "B0050UEVNM", "B00096S49Y", "B000N3SU92", "B00007AJF8", "B00AEFXESQ", "B000068V9U", "B00AEBBA2W", "B003EYVXTG", "B004SUDQ22", "6304696515", "B00J0IN6Z4", "B00G7QPXUI", "B000JBXXYK", "B0072BNJZ8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["6305594333", "B004AE3QYE", "B006YTGLE0", "B00AEBB8P6"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 126577}, "asin": "076781777X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51CH7THFMDL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "To Die For"}
{"description": "This thoroughly unpleasant thriller from the hands of Joel Schumacher (Batman and Robin) offers very little in its lurid tour of snuff films and the seedy pornographic underworld. A wooden Nicolas Cage stars as a private detective hired by a tycoon's widow, who discovers in her dead husband's safe some 8mm footage of a young girl being sexually abused and slaughtered. Cage's job is to determine the veracity of the film and to find out the girl's identity, whether she be alive or dead. What could have been a taut, nerve-jangling thriller is instead a lumbering, overwrought but underwritten tale of vigilante justice. Screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker also penned the imaginative and compellingSeven, but you wouldn't know it from this tired and monotonous script. Schumacher tries for echoes of bothThe Silence of the Lambsand Paul Schrader'sHardcore(which stars George C. Scott as a father trying to find his daughter in the seedy porn industry), but despite some slick camerawork, the film fails to draw the audience into either the mystery of the missing girl or Cage's supposed internal conflicts. It's not so much the unsavory subject matter as it is the sloppy and unimaginative filmmaking that makes the movie unbearable. Of the entire cast only Joaquin Phoenix, as a charismatic goth boy who works at an adult book store, comes away with a memorable performance.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00003JRAB", "0783223218", "6303486746", "630470786X", "6302479487", "6304826133", "6301966899"], "also_viewed": ["B00012F6A6"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 474128}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.95, "brand": "", "asin": "076781956X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5136N2XDYBL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "8mm [VHS]"}
{"description": "Bugsyrepresents an almost miraculous combination of director, writer, and star on a project that represents a career highlight for everyone involved. It's one of the best American gangster movies ever made--as good in its own way as any of theGodfatherfilms--and it's impossible to imagine anyone better than Beatty in the movie's flashy title role. As notorious mobster and Las Vegas visionary \"Bugsy\" Siegel, Beatty is perfectly cast as a man whose dreams are greater than his ability to realize them--or at least, greater than his ability to stay alive while making those dreams come true. With a glamorous Hollywood mistress (Annette Bening) who shares Bugsy's dream while pursuing her own upwardly mobile agenda, Bugsy seems oblivious to threats when he begins to spend too much of the mob's money on the creation of the Flamingo casino. Meyer Lansky (Ben Kingsley) and Mickey Cohen (Harvey Keitel) will support Bugsy's wild ambition to a point, after which all bets are off, and Bugsy's life hangs in the balance. From the obvious chemistry of Beatty and Bening (who met and later married off-screen) to the sumptuous reproduction of 1940s Hollywood, every detail in this movie feels impeccably right. Beatty is simply mesmerizing as the man who invented Las Vegas but never saw it thrive, moving from infectious idealism to brutal violence in the blink of an eye. Director Barry Levinson is also in peak form here, guiding the stylish story with a subtle balance of admiration and horror; we can catch Bugsy's Vegas fever and root for the gangster's success, but we know he'll get what he deserves. We might wish that Bugsy had lived to see his dream turn into a booming oasis, but the movie doesn't suggest that we should shed any tears.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00004U103", "B00013RC2U", "B004G7XCRQ", "B0000AMJEK", "B002954A4Q", "B007TBIUSM", "B00000JGHJ", "B000068QPV", "B0000DI87S", "B000E5KQHI", "B00AEBB9NM", "B000EHSVRI", "B000C20VPA", "B0010YVCI4", "B00008RH3L", "B001C0I61M", "B00004XPPB", "B000E8NRBC", "B00CMDPT3Q", "B000P0J09M", "0792838076", "6305297142", "0792846877", "B000GG4Y32", "B0019CUG02", "B000286RP2", "B002EAYDN4", "B004YCKKFK", "B008XTVWMU", "B002QEHPQU", "B004JKS996", "6305428522", "B000C1VAFG", "B0001EFV7C", "B00AEFY7NM", "B0007G89FK", "B00007G1YP", "B00080ZG10", "B001EKP5D2", "B00005JP93", "B008R65XYC", "B00005AA9C", "B00009Y3PV", "B00005T7I1", "B0000AM6JI", "B000N3T0H8", "B004FQX59I", "B00005V9HH", "B00005IA7Y", "B000C20VRS", "0792838068", "B002CPMB9O", "B00CCMKPO0", "B000063K2Q", "B008YAPRQK", "B000ERVKBC", "B002VWNICC", "B000P0J0AG", "B0006OEXTE", "B000NQPZCO", "B0018CMJSU", "B00AEFYTMQ", "B007NE08LM", "B00H9KKGTO", "B0006HBV3C", "B0002V7O5Q", "B00AEBB95K", "B001EIOOV8", "B0006GAOJA", "B00AEFXN9G", "0767830555", "B005S9ELVC", "B004SIP7TE", "B0006GANN2", "B0019UGYK0", "B00441GYPG", "B0009HMTGC", "B0064MT1FI", "B003HE4FAC", "B0003JANSW", "1451635672", "B00E96AZBK", "B000CNESTE", "B000M341QE", "B0006HBLUK", "B00007M57P", "B00005LC4D", "B0001FGBUW", "1467907898", "B007N31YH0", "B007UW9W5U", "B00BMJ7ZKG", "B00FRILRL6", "B00008975Z", "0792844831", "B0000542CB", "1607105829", "B001DW2BJW", "B000AQ69SG", "B00AEFXVOI"], "bought_together": ["B00004U103", "B0000AMJEK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0002V7T0G", "B00004U103", "B00013RC2U", "B000EHSVRI"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 217388}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.74, "brand": "", "asin": "0767818059", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51XE61M6B7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Bugsy"}

{"description": "Film fans might someday recognize 1997 and '98 as the years Hong Kong came to Hollywood. Stars Jackie Chan, Sammo Hung, Chow Yun-Fat, Jet Li, and Michelle Yeoh all appeared in major Hollywood projects and directors John Woo, Ronny Yu, and Tsui Hark directedFace/Off,Bride of Chucky, andKnock Off, respectively. Another entry into this new era of entertainment isThe Big Hit, directed by Che-Kirk Wong (who also directed Jackie Chan inCrime Story), executive produced by John Woo, and produced by Wesley Snipes. Mark Wahlberg leads this all-American cast in a played-for-laughs macho blowout. Rounding out the testosterone brigade are Lou Diamond Phillips (sprouting a gold-capped tooth and a dirty mouth), Bokeem Woodbine (who, according to this DVD's director audio track, wore extra socks where it counts), Antonio Sab&agrave;to Jr., and Avery Brooks. Wahlberg plays Melvin Smiley, a nice-guy hit man with an ulcer and a severe insecurity problem. He's short on cash due to the spending habits of his unsuspecting fianc&eacute;e Pam (Christina Applegate) and his girlfriend-on-the-sly Chantel (Lela Rochon). He and his crew decide to do a little freelancing and cook up their own heist to make a little mo' money--specifically by kidnapping Keiko (China Chow), the daughter of a Japanese businessman whom they target for ransom. Little do they know her dad is broke and she's the goddaughter of their boss.The Big Hithas action scenes aplenty (one of the stunt coordinators worked on Woo'sThe KillerandBullet in the Head) and the same cornball sense of humor as other films in the Hong Kong action genre.

{"description": "Another reliably well-crafted, generally engrossing documentary from Ken Burns,Lewis & Clarkemploys the director's now-familiar approach to his subjects, from its elegant juxtaposition of period illustrations and portraits against newly filmed footage of historic sites to Burns's repertory of accomplished actors to provide gravitas for quotes from the key figures. Granted the formula has become familiar enough to allow parody, but Burns knows how to invest his historical investigations with movement and drama, making this four-hour journey a worthwhile trip.As narrated by Hal Holbrook, Dayton Duncan's script explicates the agenda presented by Thomas Jefferson to Meriwether Lewis and William Clark, placing it in the context of the young country's gamble in Jefferson's Louisiana Purchase, and the expedition's goals for opening the West. While preserving the heroic scale of the undertaking, Burns also finds time to delve into the politics of the venture and the disparate personalities of the two explorers; in particular, Duncan and Burns look at the career of Lewis, the presidential prot&eacute;g&eacute;, his moody demeanor, and his  untimely death. The film also looks beyond its titular leaders to examine the personalities of their corps of soldiers, their boatmen, and the Indians they met and depended on, most notably their female Shosone guide, Sacagawea.--Sam Sutherland", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301996135", "630428957X", "B00006AUK1", "6303218725", "6304209908", "B00005N900"], "bought_together": ["630428957X"], "also_viewed": ["B00006AUK1", "0679454500"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 186485}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 14.4, "brand": "", "asin": "0780618831", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GXDB35DVL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Lewis &amp; Clark - The Journey of the Corps of Discovery [VHS]"}

{"description": "Hoo-ah! After seven Oscar nominations for his outstanding work in films such asThe Godfather,Serpico, andDog Day Afternoon, it's ironic that Al Pacino finally won the Oscar for his grandstanding lead performance in this 1992 crowd pleaser. As the blind, blunt, and ultimately benevolent retired Lieutenant Colonel Frank Slade, Pacino is both hammy and compelling, simultaneously subtle and grandly over-the-top when defending his new assistant and prep school student Charlie (Chris O'Donnell) at a disciplinary hearing. While the subplot involving Charlie's prep-school crisis plays like a sequel toDead Poets Society, Pacino's adventurous escapades in New York City provide comic relief, rich character development, and a memorable supporting role for Gabrielle Anwar as the young woman who accepts the colonel's invitation to dance the tango.Scent of a Womanis a remake of the 1972 Italian filmProfumo di donna. In addition to Pacino's award, the picture garnered Oscar nominations for director Martin Brest and for screenwriter Bo Goldman.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0790734079", "630445600X", "6303402070", "6304259131", "0800125762", "B000007OY0", "B00004WIDB", "0800100832", "6303486746", "6302415853", "6301697758", "6301578805", "0783235607", "6303269834"], "bought_together": ["0790734079"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 307456}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.83, "brand": "Scent Of A Woman", "asin": "0783204914", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514CEATZ0DL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Scent of a Woman [VHS]"}

The first major Hollywood film to be reprocessed for viewing on these massive screens,Apollo 13was shortened by 24 minutes so it could be loaded onto the gigantic reels in the IMAX theaters. The new cut delivers a mostly space-centered film; much of the domestic scenes (featuring Kathleen Quinlan's Oscar-nominated performance) are gone, which may help young space cadets get into the film. The IMAX print is also less wide than the theatrical version (1.66:1 versus 2.35:1) and delivers a DTS soundtrack not found on the theatrical version. Both prints are remastered and look grand. The main features from the initial DVD are intact (the making-of feature and two commentary tracks).

{"description": "Sir Jeremy Isaacs highly deserves the numerous awards for documentaries he has earned: the Royal Television Society's Desmond Davis Award, l'Ordre National du M&eacute;rit, an Emmy, and a knighthood from Queen Elizabeth II. His epicThe World at Warremains unsurpassed as the definitive visual history of World War II.The Second World War was different from other wars in thousands of ways, one of which was the unparalleled scope of visual documents kept by the Axis and Allies of all their activities. As a result, this war is understood as much through written histories as it is through its powerful images. The Nazis were particularly thorough in documenting even the most abhorrent of the atrocities they were committing--in a surprising amount of color footage.The World at Warwas one of the first television documentaries that exploited these resources so completely, giving viewers an unbelievable visual guide to the greatest event in the 20th century. This is to say nothing of the excellent, comprehensible narrative. Some highlights:A New Germany 1933-39: early German and Nazi documentation of Hitler's rise to power through the impending attack on PolandWhirlwind: the early British losses in the blitz in the skies over Britain and in North AfricaStalingrad: the turning point of the war and Germany's first defeatInside the Reich--Germany 1940-44: one of the most fascinating documentaries that exists on life inside Nazi Germany, fromLebensbornto the Hitler YouthMorning: prior toSaving Private Ryan, one of the only unromanticized views of the Normandy invasionGenocide: this film is one of the most widely shown introductions to the HolocaustJapan 1941-45: althoughThe World at Waris decidedly focused more on the European theater, this is an important look into wartime Japan and its expansion--early 20th-century history that lead to Japan's role in World War II is superficialThe bomb: another widely shown documentary of the Manhattan Project, the Enola Gay, Hiroshima, and NagasakiThe World at Warwill remain the definitive visual history of World War II, analogous to Gibbon'sDecline and Fall of the Roman Empire. No serious historian should be missingThe World at Warin a collection, and no student should leave school without having seen at least some of its salient episodes.

{"description": "Ranked 34 on the American Film Institute's list of the 100 Greatest American Films,To Kill a Mockingbirdis quite simply one of the finest family-oriented dramas ever made. A beautiful and deeply affecting adaptation of the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by Harper Lee, the film retains a timeless quality that transcends its historically dated subject matter (racism in the Depression-era South) and remains powerfully resonant in present-day America with its advocacy of tolerance, justice, integrity, and loving, responsible parenthood. It's tempting to call this an important &quot;message&quot; movie that should be required viewing for children and adults alike, but this riveting courtroom drama is anything but stodgy or pedantic. As Atticus Finch, the small-town Alabama lawyer and widower father of two, Gregory Peck gives one of his finest performances with his impassioned defense of a black man (Brock Peters) wrongfully accused of the rape and assault of a young white woman. While his children, Scout (Mary Badham) and Jem (Philip Alford), learn the realities of racial prejudice and irrational hatred, they also learn to overcome their fear of the unknown as personified by their mysterious, mostly unseen neighbor Boo Radley (Robert Duvall, in his brilliant, almost completely nonverbal screen debut). What emerges from this evocative, exquisitely filmed drama is a pure distillation of the themes of Harper Lee's enduring novel, a showcase for some of the finest American acting ever assembled in one film, and a rare quality of humanitarian artistry (including Horton Foote's splendid screenplay and Elmer Bernstein's outstanding score) that seems all but lost in the chaotic morass of modern cinema.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305123616", "6301797906", "6304119046", "630150528X", "6300183513", "6300181340", "0800132009", "6301720555", "6301975987", "079284517X", "6301971736", "B000006GCU", "0783235607", "6300181286", "0800100832", "6300270971", "0792839846", "6301976932", "6302909023", "6301977297", "6301976983", "0783221347", "6300182304", "6300183629", "6304117752", "6303560040", "6304429274", "0782008348", "6300181278", "6301976061", "1558807780", "6302226899", "6304151306", "6303257844", "0790743159", "0783236352", "6301586026", "1569942072", "6300214060", "B000006N70", "0800125762", "0790733935", "6302150620", "6303168507", "6301964012", "B00005LCBP", "6301773586", "B002NZK5VO", "630197350X", "B007Y1NR1W", "0790748169", "0446310786", "6300267857", "B00066FBQG", "0792133153", "B00AEBB932", "6304259131", "B00001OWYM", "6303020089", "B00003UCB0", "630310696X", "630021639X", "6301797957", "B00005NQGQ", "079212569X", "0767825616", "6301978633", "B00004TYS8", "6305718792", "0792108868", "6305050023", "6304383177", "B000EO7AIC", "0792108280", "6301661729", "6302529484", "6304457383", "0790731975", "6303382940", "0792844645", "0792116887", "6303269834", "0792837630", "6302843200", "630197333X", "B00003CXFU", "6300269310", "6301977815", "6300267970", "B000005PFL", "0782006779", "6303313345", "6300214435", "6301670159", "B000003KHS", "630027120X", "6304429711", "B0000040EO", "630157401X"], "bought_together": ["6305123616"], "also_viewed": ["0446310786", "6305123616", "0783235607", "6302226899", "0783221347", "6300215814", "0800100832", "0783216084", "6302909023", "630150528X", "0792839846", "0800132009", "6304117752", "0792837096", "B000FQJAIW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 157532}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.63, "brand": "Universal International Home Video", "asin": "0783222955", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51C084T8V7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]"}
{"description": "When attorney Julie Hastings (Frances McDormand) uncovers corrupt city real estate dealings, evil thugs attack her scientist boyfriend, Peyton Westlake (Liam Neeson). Left for dead after his lab is detonated, he miraculously survives when the ensuing blast hurls him into the nearby harbor. Treated as a John Doe at a city hospital, he is unknowingly submitted to radical therapy which numbs his nerves to feeling--but which heightens his strength and his emotions. Once conscious, Peyton escapes from the hospital and builds a ramshackle lab in an abandoned industrial plant. Horribly burned and scarred by the lab explosion, he uses synthetic skin to impersonate his would-be murderers and seek retribution for their evil deeds. Peyton also tries to reunite with Julie, who believes him to be dead. While the film has an average script, it is overcome by the flashy cinematography of Bill Pope, the bombastic score by Danny Elfman, and the well-choreographed direction of Sam Raimi. The director confidently walks the line between suspense, action, comedy, and romance as he examines a bitter, victimized antihero who risks becoming as monstrous on the inside as he appears on the outside.--Bryan Reesman", "related": {"also_bought": ["078323046X", "078321958X", "B0003JANT6", "B00BTYMPUY", "B0007PALZ2", "B003498SCQ", "078322799X", "B0009X768W", "B00005N7Z1", "B0002J58HO", "6305428514", "B00003CXQA", "B002AS466O", "B0009PVZD2", "B005LAIIRQ", "B001R3YRG2", "B0009X76XC", "B004A8ZX28", "B0015XHQT4", "B00AEFXCLU", "B0085A9HU6", "B000RW3VCK", "B00005JLWN", "B00007AJG4", "B00005K3NR", "0783225520", "B001F7MSFM", "079284646X", "B00008L3UM", "B002O3Z4ZW", "B0000A9GHD", "1558908846", "B00004Y87O", "B00FQPLZ08", "B000OVLBHG", "B001J710Y8", "0767802454", "B0001Z37HM", "0783227434", "0783229402", "B00026ZG10", "B00008G8LY", "6304698747", "B005J9ZFQG", "B000PMFRZQ", "B0045HCJGC", "0767821629", "0767817710", "B000NOIVT0", "B001JFZ118", "B001B43IVW", "B00005JKWJ", "B00005N5RM", "B000068IEV", "B0045HCJG2", "0783223609", "B0007PALGG", "B0024FADD8", "078401132X", "6304723113", "B0001VTPW2", "B00000ILDD", "6305767866", "079283366X", "B001TODCII", "B00005M2CO", "B00J2PQYYK", "B0067EKYAY", "B000FFJYAC", "B00BPEJWAE", "B002GHHHG0", "B002ZG994U", "B0007V6ITE", "B000MV8ABS", "B000NIBURQ", "B0040J1RX6", "B00001O2H0", "B004BZ5AN2", "0767815718", "B00003CXKA", "B003XURDAY", "0767811097", "B0002KVUKM", "B007ZC31R0", "B009AMAJPA", "0783226934", "B001FZQOW2", "B008G33PIM", "B0000UJL96", "B00004XMSC", "B00441GYZG", "B00DW5IKW0", "B003AWRM9W", "B00441GYXS", "B000031EG1", "0790729342", "B000NO1XJA", "B0090EDEM8", "B00007AJGH", "B003UGLCIA"], "bought_together": ["078323046X", "B0003JANT6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000PFUAP0", "078321958X", "6305841985", "B00GHH9IIA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 56997}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.86, "brand": "Universal", "asin": "0783226012", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51B63F94CML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Darkman"}
{"description": "It's hard to ignore the sad and conspicuous absence of the late John Belushi, but this long-delayed sequel to 1980'sThe Blues Brothersstill has Dan Aykroyd--as Chicago bad boy and blues rocker Elwood Blues--to keep the music alive. Once again, Elwood's trying to reunite the original Blues Brothers Band, and this time he's got a strip-joint bartender (John Goodman) and a 10-year-old orphan named Buster (J. Evan Bonifant) joining him at center stage. Believing that Elwood has kidnapped the kid, the cops are hot on his trail as the reunited band hits the road for the Battle of the Bands in Louisiana and the All-Star Blues Jam that ends the movie in a rockin' blaze of glory. It's a shameless clone of the first film, and nobody--especially not Aykroyd or director John Landis--seems to care that the story's not nearly as fun as the music that's used to stretch it out. Of course there's a seemingly endless parade of stunts, including a nonstop pileup of police cars that's hilariously absurd, but what really matters here--indeed, the movie's only saving grace--is the great lineup of legendary blues musicians. Aretha Franklin, James Brown, Junior Wells, Eric Clapton, B.B. King, Jonny Lang, Eddie Floyd, and Blues Traveler are among the many special guests assembled for the film, and their stellar presence makes you wonder if the revived Blues Brothers shouldn't remain an obscure opening act.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783231482"], "bought_together": ["0783231482"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 258505}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.49, "brand": "", "asin": "0783227078", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DGQ2RVTPL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Blues Brothers 2000 [VHS]"}
{"description": "Somewhere in Time is the story of a young writer who sacrifices his life in the present to find happiness in the past, where true love awaits him. Young Richard Collier (Christopher Reeve) is approached by an elderly woman who gives him an antique gold watch and who pleads with him to return in time with her. Years later, Richard Collier is overwhelmed by a photograph of a beautiful young woman (Jane Seymour). Another picture of this woman in her later years reveals to him that she is the same woman who had given him the gold watch.

{"description": "Imitation of Life is a 1934 American drama film directed by John M. Stahl. The screenplay by William Hurlbut, based on Fannie Hurst's 1933 novel of the same name, was augmented by eight additional uncredited writers, including Preston Sturges and Finley Peter Dunne.[1] The film stars Claudette Colbert, Warren William and Rochelle Hudson and features Louise Beavers and Fredi Washington.  The theme of the movie, to the modern eye, deals with very important issues - passing, the role of black servants in white families, maternal affection-and remains very watchable.

{"description": "The original cowriter and director ofFear and Loathing in Las Vegaswas Alex Cox, whose earlier filmSid and Nancysuggests that Cox could have been a perfect match in filming  Hunter&nbsp;S. Thompson's psychotropic masterpiece of \"gonzo\" journalism. Unfortunately Cox departed due to the usual \"creative differences,\" and this ill-fated adaptation was thrust upon Terry Gilliam, whose formidable gifts as a visionary filmmaker were squandered on the seemingly unfilmable elements of Thompson's ether-fogged narrative. The result is a one-joke movie without the joke--an endless series of repetitive scenes involving rampant substance abuse and the hallucinogenic fallout of a road trip that's run crazily out of control. Johnny Depp plays Thompson's alter ego, \"gonzo\" journalist Raoul Duke, and Benicio Del Toro is his sidekick and so-called lawyer Dr. Gonzo. During the course of a trip to Las Vegas to cover a motorcycle race, they ingest a veritable chemistry set of drugs, and Gilliam does his best to show us the hallucinatory state of their zonked-out minds. This allows for some dazzling imagery and the rampant humor of stumbling buffoons, and the mumbling performances of Depp and Del Toro wholeheartedly embrace the tripped-out, paranoid lunacy of Thompson's celebrated book. But over two hours of this insanity tends to grate on the nerves--like being the only sober guest at a party full of drunken idiots. So while Gilliam's film may achieve some modest cult status over the years, it's only becauseFear and Loathingis best enjoyed by those who are just as stoned as the characters in the movie.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0006H32EI", "B006ISJQ1W", "B00003CXWV", "0767837398", "B002AF4Y9G", "B000A7DVR2", "B001EDFSIQ", "0679785892", "B0057ZAA6W", "6305313687", "B00029RTAI", "B0007DFJ0G", "B002QEHPQU", "B00008975Z", "B001HN69AY", "B004SIP9Z6", "B00005JM23", "B000F7CECK", "B000JMK6LW", "B000093FLA", "B000P0J09M", "B003HKN52U", "0783225903", "B00005R87R", "B004SIP95G", "B00000IRE6", "B000031EFY", "B00005ATQB", "B005Y4I6VW", "B0006HBZE2", "B00005Q4CS", "B004FQX5B6", "B009NNXQJW", "B0000VD04M", "B00006JDU8", "B00005V9HH", "B00011CZRE", "B002T9H2LA", "B000C20VPA", "B002CPMB9O", "B000AXWHSA", "B000ASDFI6", "B000P0J0D8", "0792838068", "B003W88QVC", "B00029RTCG", "B0011E5M66", "B0007PALZ2", "B00005JMJG", "B007D0FVRM", "B001J9KJ4I", "B006ISJQBM", "B000EMGJAO", "B0000CDUT5", "B000KB4898", "B0000AC8LR", "B004P7CNC2", "B004SIP7TE", "B00AEFXE9U", "B004SIP8ES", "B00AEFYS2M", "B000C20VRS", "B0000AC8LI", "B00ALU48M0", "B0009A40ES", "B000LP6KNU", "B00H9KKGTO", "B00AEBB8NI", "B0000640VJ", "B004SIP6LS", "B000286RP2", "B000GGSMC6", "0780621611", "B001HN694K", "B00009W5CA", "B004XVMCH6", "B001GCUO0W", "B000GBEWGQ", "B0006GAOJA", "B008R65XYC", "B000IY04Q8", "B000006NN1", "B000S6M1Y4", "B0012E2GFK", "B0007UC8Y4", "B0043X1FM2", "B0001CNRRU", "B00ALU46VI", "0767835093", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00005NTOH", "B000MMMT9G", "B005LAIIJY", "B00AG4714S", "B00000K3TS", "B000053VAZ", "B00009MGEM", "B001M4YZ90", "B002ZG980U", "1451659717"], "bought_together": ["B00003CXWV"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0679785892", "B00029RTAI", "0783225903", "B000A7DVR2"]}, "price": 5.0, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 3274}, "asin": "0783229526", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51LL2U2I2AL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"}
{"description": "A phenomenal hit when it was released in 1989,Field of Dreamshas become a modern classic and a uniquely American slice of cinema. It functions effectively as a moving drama about the power of dreams, a fantasy ode to our national pastime, and a brilliant adaptation of W.P. Kinsella's exquisite baseball novelShoeless Joe. Kinsella himself found the film a delightful surprise, differing greatly from his novel but benefiting from its own creative variations. It is the film that cemented Kevin Costner's status as an all-American screen star, but the story resonates far beyond Costner's handsome appeal. As just about everyone knows by now, Costner stars as Iowa farmer Ray Kinsella, who hears the mysterious words &quot;If you build it, he will come,&quot; and is compelled to build a baseball diamond in the middle of his cornfield. His wife (Amy Madigan) supports the wild idea, but a reclusive novelist (modeled after J.D. Salinger and played by James Earl Jones) is not so easily persuaded. The idealistic farmer is either a visionary or a deluded fool, but his persistence is rewarded when spirits from baseball's past begin appearing on the ball field. Past and present intermingle in the person of &quot;Moonlight Graham&quot; (superbly played by Burt Lancaster), an unknown player who sacrificed his dreams of baseball glory for a dignified life as a small-town physician ... but what all of this means is unclear until the film's memorably heartfelt conclusion.

{"description": "Wes Craven's horror pictures always have a few wild ideas knocking  around inside them, and this 1989 slashfest is no exception. The electrocution of a mass murderer turns into a kind of cosmic jump-start:  evil Horace Pinker is reborn as an elusive electronic phantom, capable of leaping from one body to another. (This trick is also used to good effect inThe HiddenandFallen.) Pinker's a stinker, and Craven was clearly trying to set up another franchise villain in the vein of hisNightmare on Elm Streetchamp, Freddy Krueger--perhaps a bit too baldly. However, amidst the mayhem, the film's real subject is the poisonous presence of mass media, as Pinker (played byThe X-Files' Mitch Pileggi)  insinuates himself as a free-floating spirit run amok in television itself. In its own pulp way,Shockergets at the heart of media-culture inanity quicker than a ten-week college class on the subject, and although Craven occasionally lapses into generic bloodletting, he always snaps right back with some crazy angle on the TV nation. The hero is played by a young Peter Berg, theChicago Hopestar who would go on to direct his own shocker,Very Bad Things.Shockerfailed to catch on with audiences (somewhere there's a warehouse full of unsold Horace Pinker action figures), but it's definitely worth a look for horror fans.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005N5RM", "B000008KNW", "B003THSXJ6", "B0016MJ6P6", "B000TUDFDU", "B0002VYOVS", "B000099T3M", "B00009PY4C", "B000TUDBFM", "B00K1L4NBU", "B00E5S2HGS", "B00BTYPW7C", "B000096FVG", "B000IJ7A5Q", "0767817664", "B0053TWW9K", "B0000CEB6Y", "B00A429Y56", "B00CERJI5U", "B00JU94ZPS", "B0085Z3ADQ", "B005FRWU5Q", "B000TUDBFW", "B00AEFYXQI", "B001B8XRT6", "B0001US7OA", "B00D97DMBU", "B00BCMSY80", "B000I2J68M", "B00005O5B5", "B005OT810I", "B0053TWW36", "B0053TWVA0", "B0002DB5PO", "B009IV2Z3M", "B00D7AM5XU", "B0000AOX0D", "B00IA1VKVY", "B0000AOX0A", "B00ETHN9L2", "B00AEFY2WI", "B005S2F8LQ", "B0002S9QUA", "B008DVJOQ4", "B008R9GVHM", "B00DOZNGTK", "B00HRUQ8X4", "B00CPTUNVA", "B00CPTUNZG", "B00005JP3R", "B003PIUINI", "B00AEBB91E", "B00HRUQ9W4", "B00018D42W", "B00EF0NY7W", "0792839706", "B00HRUQB8Q", "B000MV8AC2", "B0002T7YNA", "B00AEFYDGI", "B00006FDCD", "B00JHH1VSW", "B002HML6YI", "B0001ZX0GK", "6305841985", "B008VF0Y0M", "B00AEFY2LO", "B0002KQNL8", "B00DBNLAZW", "630512003X", "B000092T4C", "B00JQYV0B4", "B00EVIOWUG", "B000069I05", "B00317LM9W", "B0091G7BTM", "B000A7Q1UQ", "B00K31RC20", "B00GSTHD1G", "B00EVU3RSW", "B002I41KNC", "B00EALTVPA", "B004AC6PMG", "B005LS4MQY", "B00GSMZ3I8", "B0000ALPFL", "6304604572", "B00A429Y9M", "6305976422", "B000S0GYRU", "B00AEFY31S", "B007NPUWDA", "B00GJ7CUFG", "B005CFBZWK", "B00AEFY37C", "B00GHH9GSC", "B001QMCJ00", "B001B1UO6W", "B00CERJIH8"], "bought_together": ["B003THSXJ6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000N4RAQU", "B0024FADB0", "B000008KNW", "B00EALTVAA"]}, "price": 9.26, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 59173}, "asin": "0783232101", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515ZNK3KNJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Shocker"}

{"description": "Patterns exist everywhere: in nature, in science, in religion, in  business. Max Cohen (played hauntingly by Sean Gullette) is a mathematician searching for these patterns in everything. Yet, he's not the only one, and everyone from Wall Street investors, looking to break the market, to Hasidic Jews, searching for the 216-digit number that reveals the true name of God, are trying to get their hands on Max. This dark, low-budget film was shot in black and white by director Darren Aronofsky. With eerie music, voice-overs, and overt symbolism enhancing the somber mood, Aronofsky has created a disturbing look at the world. Max is deeply paranoid, holed up in his apartment with his computer Euclid, obsessively studying chaos theory.  Blinding headaches and hallucinogenic visions only feed his paranoia as he attempts to remain aloof from the world, venturing out only to meet his mentor, Sol Robeson (Mark Margolis), who for some mysterious reason feels Max should take a break from his research. This movie is complex--occasionallytoocomplex--but the psychological drama and the loose sci-fi elements make this a worthwhile, albeit consuming, watch.Piwon the Director's Award at the 1998 Sundance Film Festival.--Jenny Brown", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 496232}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.99, "brand": "", "asin": "0784011796", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51P5P0C06XL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Pi [VHS]"}

{"description": "It always comes up when people are comparing their most traumatic movie experiences: \"the death of Bambi's mother,\" a recollection that can bring a shudder to even the most jaded filmgoer. That primal separation (which is no less stunning for happening off-screen) is the centerpiece ofBambi, Walt Disney's 1942 animated classic, but it is by no means the only bold stroke in the film. In its swift but somehow leisurely 69 minutes,Bambicovers a year in the life of a young deer. But in a bigger way, it measures the life cycle itself, from birth to adulthood, from childhood's freedom to grown-up responsibility. All of this is rendered in cheeky, fleet-footed style--the movie doesn't lecture, or make you feel you're being fed something that's good for you. The animation is miraculous, a lush forest in which nature is a constantly unfolding miracle (even in a spectacular fire, or those dark moments when \"man was in the forest\"). There are probably easier animals to draw than a young deer, and the Disney animators set themselves a challenge with Bambi's wobbly glide across an ice-covered lake, his spindly legs akimbo; but the sequence is effortless and charming. If Bambi himself is just a bit dull--such is the fate of an Everydeer--his rabbit sidekick Thumper and a skunk named Flower more than make up for it. Many of the early Disney features have their share of lyrical moments and universal truths, butBambiis so simple, so pure, it's almost transparent. You might borrow a phrase from Thumper and say it's downright twitterpated.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["155890641X", "0788812807", "6302642248", "0788802194", "6302320402", "6304401132", "078881172X", "6304500831", "6303314015", "6300274195", "0788812408", "6302526574", "6302787068", "6302961572", "6300274268", "6305229449", "6303983812", "0788803743", "6304089767", "B0000AQZYM", "B000035Z2S", "6305319138", "6300275310", "0788805843", "0788805533", "6303929338", "6302158095", "6302178924", "6304100507", "B00005JKDQ", "6304400551", "6305326940", "6304290888", "6304978286", "6304400225", "6305940932", "B00004R99N", "6303036813", "6301390725", "B00003CX7L", "B0000E32WB", "6304089201", "B00000ICHA", "B000B8QG3G", "B0000524CZ", "6302426200", "6304501153", "B00003CXQX", "B00005T7H6", "1558906150", "6300274608", "B00000JS61", "6303534422", "B0009SUS4Q", "6304400381", "B00004R99I", "B000009CTR", "6302484359", "6301991311", "B00005RDVV", "B0007A2GSM", "B00003CXHR", "0788811002", "B000035Z46", "B00005RRG3", "6300276554", "6303122647", "6303123244", "6304401736", "0788812181", "B00006IUM9", "1558901892", "6301948106", "6305942285", "6300277003", "B00003CWPW", "6304015127", "B00007AJLB", "B00005JL95", "0788810634", "6304873441", "6303295614", "6303939015", "0783236689", "6304117752", "B00016JF2W", "B000BAVLYS", "0788812440", "B0002YLCHE", "6302481805", "6304155972", "6303991408", "B00008Y47S", "B00003CXXI", "B000B8QG4A", "6302961661", "B00003CXQ6", "B0001I55VK", "B00004YNUH"], "bought_together": ["155890641X", "0788802194"], "also_viewed": ["155890641X", "0788802194", "6303314015", "0788812408", "6304500831", "6302526574", "6302320402", "078881172X", "6302642248", "6302787068", "0788812807", "6300274195", "6304401132", "6302961572", "6304089767", "6300274268", "0788805843", "B000035Z2S", "6304290888", "0788805533", "6305319138", "6303983812", "6305229449", "6303929338", "6300275310", "6302178924", "6304400551", "B0000AQZYM", "6302158095", "6303534422", "B00005JKDQ", "B0007KTBIU", "6305326940", "B00003CXQX", "6304501153", "6303036813", "B000B8QG3G", "6304100507", "B00004R99N", "6305940932", "B00003CXHR", "6304978286", "B000035Z46", "B00005JL95", "B00005RDVV", "B005JQFQ5Y", "B00003CX7L", "6304873441", "6304089201", "6304400225", "6302426200", "6301991311", "6304401736", "0788811002", "B0000524CZ", "6300274608", "6301390725", "B00016JF2W", "B00004REYY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 63167}, "categories": [["CDs & Vinyl", "Children's Music", "Disney"], ["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.94, "brand": "Disney", "asin": "0788806270", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DVF3SBVRL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Bambi (Walt Disney's Masterpiece) [VHS]"}
{"description": "Robin Williams won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor, and actors Matt Damon and Ben Affleck nabbed one for Best Original Screenplay, but the feel-good hitGood Will Huntingtriumphs because of its gifted director, Gus Van Sant. The unconventional director (My Own Private Idaho,Drugstore Cowboy) saves a script marred by vanity and clunky character development by yanking soulful, touching performances out of his entire cast (amazingly, even one by Williams that's relatively schtick-free). Van Sant pulls off the equivalent of what George Cukor accomplished for women's melodrama in the '30s and '40s: He's crafted an intelligent, unabashedly emotional male weepie about men trying to find inner-wisdom.Matt Damon stars as Will Hunting, a closet math genius who ignores his gift in favor of nightly boozing and fighting with South Boston buddies (co-writer Ben Affleck among them). While working as a university janitor, he solves an impossible calculus problem scribbled on a hallway blackboard and reluctantly becomes the prodigy of an arrogant MIT professor (Stellan Skarsg&#229;rd). Damon only avoids prison by agreeing to see psychiatrists, all of whom he mocks or psychologically destroys until he meets his match in the professor's former childhood friend, played by Williams. Both doctor and patient are haunted by the past, and as mutual respect develops, the healing process begins. The film's beauty lies not with grand climaxes, but with small, quiet moments. Scenes such as Affleck's clumsy pep talk to Damon while they drink beer after work, or any number of therapy session between Williams and Damon offer poignant looks at the awkward ways men show affection and feeling for one another.--Dave McCoy", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000FVQLQQ", "B000P0J0EW", "6305144168", "B0043X1FL8", "B00000IQV7", "B00AEFY0F2", "B0000YEEGM", "B00JPQ1INI", "B004FQX5B6", "0800141741", "B00011CZRE", "B00AEFXESQ", "B00562D3Y2", "B00125WAWS", "0783226845", "B003ASLJQS", "B00005JLRZ", "B000M341QE", "B0034G4P7G", "B002ZG99N6", "B000N4RAR4", "0767811100", "6305428352", "B000P0J0EM", "B00009W5CA", "B002NZK5UK", "B003ASLJO0", "B00003CWQR", "B004SIP7VM", "B000B8QG22", "B00005V9HH", "B001F34HRS", "B004AOECXI", "B000N6U0E2", "B00AEFXYJA", "079284646X", "B0043X1FM2", "B00AEFY17E", "B000066HAS", "B000PHVZNE", "B003AWRMC4", "B00000G3PA", "B00AEBB9F0", "B00005JKWX", "B000MZHW40", "B000Z8GZYW", "B0018CWW5K", "B000P0J0C4", "B000P0J09M", "B00004BZIY", "B00B0U2SFE", "B003AWRMCE", "B00001ZWUS", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00005B6JZ", "B00005JLSB", "B0002ZDVEU", "6305428271", "B000FKO5QK", "B00AEBB9SM", "B00007GZR5", "B001SN78JO", "B000QQLVPQ", "630587493X", "B0001ADAVK", "B004WCTLNY", "0792843592", "B00AEBBA36", "B000FVQLRA", "B00AEFXXMI", "B000XJD33O", "B0002WZTOI", "B00004XPPG", "B00008G8M4", "B00AEBB9LO", "B000056VP4", "B006VRRGNK", "6305313687", "B0006FYOTC", "B001QERPAC", "B002O3Z4WK", "B001680M26", "B00AEFY4CG", "B000YDBPAM", "B0068FZ0GK", "0767836359", "B00005JN2Z", "B000765IJK", "B00008NFR4", "630471193X", "B002NZK5VO", "B000EGDB10", "B000068MBX", "B00000J122", "B00AMSLDTM", "B000MNOX94", "B000R4SMCW", "B00009AOBI", "B000XR9L50", "B00005JOC9"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000P0J0EW", "B000M341QE", "0783226845", "B002ZG99N6"]}, "price": 8.67, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 107799}, "asin": "0788814664", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51EQNMPT51L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Good Will Hunting"}

After Alex is jailed for bludgeoning the Cat Lady (Miriam Karlin) to death with one of her phallic sculptures, Alex submits to the Ludovico behavior modification technique to earn his freedom; he's conditioned to abhor violence through watching gory movies, and even his adored Beethoven is turned against him.

{"description": "Stanley Kubrick'sThe Shiningis less an adaptation of Stephen King's bestselling horror novel than a complete reimagining of it from the inside out. In King's book, the Overlook Hotel is a haunted place that takes possession of its off-season caretaker and provokes him to murderous rage against his wife and young son. Kubrick's movie is an existential Road Runner cartoon (his steadicam scurrying through the hotel's labyrinthine hallways), in which the cavernously empty spaces inside the Overlook mirror the emptiness in the soul of the blocked writer, who's settled in for a long winter's hibernation. As many have pointed out, King's protagonist goes mad, but Kubrick's Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) is Looney Tunes from the moment we meet him--all arching eyebrows and mischievous grin. (Both Nicholson and Shelley Duvall reach new levels of hysteria in their performances, driven to extremes by the director's fanatical demands for take after take after take.)The Shiningis terrifying--but not in the way fans of the novel might expect. When it was redone as a TV miniseries (reportedly because of King's dissatisfaction with the Kubrick film), the famous topiary-animal attack (which was deemed impossible to film in 1980) was there--but the deeper horror was lost. Kubrick'sThe Shininggets under your skin and chills your bones; it stays with you, inhabits you, haunts you. And there's no place to hide...--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300267881", "0790734079", "B00005ATQA", "6302038308", "6300182770", "B0009RRUKW", "0783235607", "0783228317", "B00000J2KZ", "B00004RNAC", "0790736039", "B00023NRSM", "6304508611", "6300182878", "6302921058", "6304509154", "0783216084", "6300214087", "B00004W5UA", "6301427076", "630268644X", "B000003KHS", "B000AMW2TK", "0790700506", "6300181340", "6300214753", "6302054982", "0784011923", "6305363668", "6303686796", "6305095566", "630021639X", "6302822688", "6305576173", "0783246641", "6304994540", "6303953425", "B00004U8PA", "0792158261", "0792100085", "6300213986", "6300189015", "630533577X", "6300214826", "0792846303", "6304288433", "6300147630", "0792842111", "B000007OY0", "0790741512", "6302158176", "0792846311", "6300183416", "0800103106", "B000005PFL", "6300183211", "0790733927", "6301666569", "6301871952", "0767825411", "630339406X", "6303109950", "6300216500", "6300214192", "6300262731", "6303257674", "6304214502", "630018627X", "6300214311", "1558807381", "0792839234", "0767819187", "B00005B238", "0790731975", "6303579388", "B000059HFB", "6302798450", "B00000FZCU", "6303651461", "6303566391", "6302642175", "6301971582", "6300218058", "6301094352", "6300184064", "6300181278", "6304457383", "6300214672", "6300262855", "0800125762", "6303257305"], "bought_together": ["0790734079"], "also_viewed": ["6300147630", "6300182878", "B00005ATQA", "6300189015", "6300267881", "B00023NRSM", "6300213005", "6303953425", "0307743659", "6303148352", "0790734079", "B001AQT0Z4", "6300183211", "0784011923", "B00BBND56G", "0788806270"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 268792}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.0, "brand": "", "asin": "0790705141", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5106FV0S4PL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Shining [VHS]"}
{"description": "When Ridley Scott's cut ofBlade Runnerwas finally released in 1993, one had to wonder why the studio hadn't done it right the first time--11 years earlier. This version is so much better, mostly because of what's been eliminated (the ludicrous and redundant voice-over narration and the phony happy ending) rather than what's been added (a bit more character development and a brief unicorn dream). Star Harrison Ford originally recorded the narration under duress at the insistence of Warner Bros. executives who thought the story needed further \"explanation\"; he later confessed that he thought if he did it badly they wouldn't use it. (Moral: Never overestimate the taste of movie executives.) The movie's spectacular futuristic vision of Los Angeles--a perpetually dark and rainy metropolis that's the nightmare antithesis of \"Sunny Southern California\"--is still its most seductive feature, an otherworldly atmosphere in which you can immerse yourself. The movie's shadowy visual style, along with its classic private-detective/murder-mystery plot line (with Ford on the trail of a murderous android, or \"replicant\"), makesBlade Runnerone of the few science fiction pictures to legitimately claim a place in the film noir tradition. And, as in the best noir, the sleuth discovers a whole lot more (about himself and the people he encounters) than he anticipates.... With Sean Young, Edward James Olmos, Daryl Hannah, Rutger Hauer, and M. Emmet Walsh.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783225903", "B004L9GMBC", "0783226063", "B00000ILDD", "0800195175", "B0018O4YT0", "B0007PALZ2", "B00004Y87O", "B003ELKNH2", "B00AEFYDM2", "B0002CHIKG", "B00005ATQB", "B00005JL78", "0790729342", "B0045HCJKS", "0767830555", "B0002CHK1S", "B00005N5S5", "B000063JDE", "B000P0J0AQ", "B00005R2IS", "B0013LL2Z2", "B00I9TDMRM", "B0045HCJ9O", "B008MIMWP8", "B0045HCJ0S", "B00005JLWN", "B00005N7Z1", "B000YBKO6U", "B0006GAOJA", "B0007DFJ0G", "B001WLMOL4", "B00003CXXP", "6304698798", "B00000JSJC", "B000286RP2", "B003AWRMCE", "B0040QYROA", "0783228457", "B004SIP9Z6", "B002ZG980U", "079284646X", "B00079Z9VO", "B002VWNIAY", "B00005J75F", "B005LAIHXQ", "B000VECAD0", "B0000VCZK2", "B00005PJ8T", "0345404475", "B001DJLD1M", "0792839056", "B0045HCJ9E", "B0050FXDDQ", "B0045HCJGC", "B004SIP95G", "B007STBUHI", "B00006ADD5", "B00GHJ1YUI", "B003ZXDP0Q", "B000A7DVR2", "0790731932", "B000NA1WGS", "B00AMSLDTM", "B008JFUN50", "B0068FZ0O2", "B000QUCQX8", "B000E6ESEO", "B00AEFXN9G", "B004FQX5B6", "B0002KVUKM", "B0016I0AJG", "B007FQXEWI", "B000N6TX1I", "B002VWNIDG", "B00ENNBZ68", "B00K5EJHGO", "B001VLBDD0", "078401213X", "0780022343", "B0018CMJSU", "B005LAII3A", "B000OVLBHG", "B006TTC5HC", "B0049985XW", "B0000844I8", "B00005JKFR", "B00AEFY3MC", "B000BZISSU", "0783226837", "6305133476", "B000022TSY", "B000FS9FCG", "B00070FX5U", "B008MIMWQW", "B00AEBBADG", "B004GJYRKA", "B002Z7FWBI", "B000BR9S96", "B00000K3TS"], "bought_together": ["B004L9GMBC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005LAIHXQ", "B009JBWOU0", "B00HUCF7AO", "B0018O4YT0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 68358}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 10.21, "brand": "WARNER BROTHERS", "asin": "0790729628", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ST8TQP63L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)"}
{"description": "One of the funniest films in many a moon was hiding at art house  theaters in 1998. FormerSaturday Night Livecomedian and Spinal Tap member Christopher Guest creates the ultimate parody of small-town dramatics,Waiting for Guffman. Corky St. Claire (Guest), an overwhelming drama director hiding out in Blaine, Missouri, thinks he has found the vehicle to put him back on Broadway:  the city's 150th anniversary play,Red, White, and Blaine.As rehearsals start, we learn of the town's history (\"the stool capital of the world\") including a brush with a UFO. The mockumentary follows the various townsfolk wishing for stardom: Parker Posey as a Dairy Queen clerk, Catherine O'Hara and Fred Willard as stage-struck travel agents, Matthew Keeslar as the town's bad boy, and Eugene Levy (who cowrote the film with Guest) as a dentist who dreams of glory on the stage. The film is a hoot from beginning to end, and be sure to watch the closing credits. Fans of Guest's deft dry humor should not miss his other parody of the entertainment world,The Big Picture(Kevin Bacon as a student filmmaker who goes to Hollywood).--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005ALS0", "B0000ALFVD", "B000M341Q4", "B00005NKC9", "6305922756", "B0007UC8Y4", "B0000ALFVE"], "bought_together": ["B00005ALS0", "B0000ALFVD"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 288595}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.45, "brand": "", "asin": "079073155X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51MCNQ0AY9L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Waiting for Guffman [VHS]"}
{"description": "Winner of four Academy Awards, including best picture, director, supporting actor, and best editing, Clint Eastwood's 1992 masterpiece stands as one of the greatest and most thematically compelling Westerns ever made. &quot;The movie summarized everything I feel about the Western,&quot; said Eastwood at the time of the film's release. &quot;The moral is the concern with gunplay.&quot; To illustrate that theme, Eastwood stars as a retired, once-ruthless killer-turned-gentle-widower and hog farmer. He accepts one last bounty-hunter mission--to find the men who brutalized a prostitute--to help support his two motherless children. Joined by his former partner (Morgan Freeman) and a cocky greenhorn (Jaimz Woolvett), he takes on a corrupt sheriff (Oscar winner Gene Hackman) in a showdown that makes the viewer feel the full impact of violence and its corruption of the soul.

{"description": "A surprise sleeper hit when released in 1992, this romantic fantasy works as a comedic adventure and a gentle tearjerker thanks to Mel Gibson's appealing performance. He plays Daniel, a daring test pilot who is deeply distraught by the apparent death of his girlfriend, Helen, in 1939. Feeling little reason to live, he volunteers for a pioneering cryogenics experiment and is thawed out 50 years later by two young boys. They bring the confused pilot home to Nat's single mom, Claire (Jamie Lee Curtis). There's a hint of romance, but Daniel desperately needs to know if Helen really died in 1939, and he discovers that love has a way of surviving a half-century leap in time. The premise is hokey and certain plot details are conveniently ignored, but Gibson, Curtis, and Elijah Wood (as Nat) hold it together with irresistible charm and just the right balance of fantasy and drama.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00000IQW5", "B00004W46I", "B00019073K", "630471193X", "B002GHHHP6", "6305213283", "B002GOAGZC", "0783227396", "0783230079", "B001CW8016", "630542845X", "B000FO0A9W", "B000FO0AA6", "B00AEBB8YW", "B00AEBB9WI", "B002NZK5TQ", "B005FQ2H8W", "6305428514", "B001C47ZOW", "0783226810", "6305133468", "B001BGS17Q", "B00005RRK1", "B0045HCJRQ", "B00AEFY4CG", "B004SIP8JI", "6304765266", "0783226896", "B000NA1WDQ", "B000JYW5B4", "B001ECDVK4", "0767810856", "B002GHHHKQ", "B00D2UMHGA", "B0045HCJ9E", "B003ASLJPE", "B000CEV3M8", "6305428506", "B00AEBB8NS", "0783225733", "6305236569", "B00AEFYXJ0", "B001ECDVJU", "B002GIBVV6", "B0068FZ0GK", "B0000A2ZO0", "B0002TSZI8", "B0039QPVRY", "B000FOPPC4", "630587493X", "B000QQLVPQ", "B00003CWU3", "B00AEFY0F2", "B000065V3L", "B005F2JRUC", "B00007GZR5", "B004SIP9RO", "B00008G8M4", "B004SIP8LG", "B00004YA66", "B000YDBPAM", "B004AOECXI", "B000P0J0CY", "B00407PNY2", "B003AWRMBA", "B0000AOV4I", "B000ENC5YW", "0783230591", "B000Y11B7Q", "B00081912E", "B00008G7UF", "B00008DDXA", "B007JNR4WI", "B002GHHHPQ", "B001BGS16W", "0790731932", "B00158K0QU", "B002GHHHHO", "B00005T7I1", "B0000542C9"], "bought_together": ["B00004W46I"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00004W46I", "B00000IQW5", "B002GHHHP6", "630471193X"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 98219}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.12, "brand": "Forever", "asin": "0790731916", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Z75D1Y4XL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Forever Young (Snap Case)"}
{"description": "In the fourth and reportedly final film of theLethal Weaponseries, director Richard Donner reunites with Mel Gibson and Danny Glover, who reprise their roles as Martin Riggs and Roger Murtaugh for one last hurrah in a film that is decidedly better than the third and first chapters. This time the pair are pitted against Jet Li, who plays the leader of a Chinese  organized crime unit. Li, a veteran of hundreds of Hong Kong action films, more than holds his own against the more established team of Gibson, Glover, Renee Russo, and Joe Pesci with his subtle yet strong portrayal of the quietly irrepressible Wah Sing Ku. As always with theLethalseries, the plot is incredibly simple to follow: someone steals something, someone gets killed, and Murtaugh is reluctantly thrown into the mix while Riggs dives into the case with gleeful aplomb. As with the previous movies, we watch for the sheer action and chemistry alone. The action sequences throughout the fourth installment are exquisite, from the opening scene involving a flamethrower, a burning building, and a half-naked Murtaugh strutting like a chicken (don't ask, just watch), to the climactic showdown that pays genuine tribute to Jet Li's masterful martial art skills. As for chemistry, the bond between these characters is so strong by now that you sometimes feel like you're watching a TV series in its sixth season, such is the warm familiarity between the audience and the personalities on the screen. The humor is more fluid than ever, aided immeasurably by the casting of comedian Chris Rock, who like Li does a great job of making his presence known in some memorable verbal tirades that would bring a smile out of the Farrelly brothers. But it's the verbal and emotional jousting between Glover and Gibson that makes this fourth episode especially appealing; both are in peak form with great physical and verbal timing. One can only hope that if this is indeed the last of theLethalfilms, that it won't be the last time we see Glover and Gibson together on screen.--Jeremy Storey", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300271331", "6302596092", "6301572688", "6301017080", "B000U1ZV8K", "6304681496", "6304007523", "6302765536", "B00004XPQ6", "6302091632", "6304932553", "080010367X"], "bought_together": ["6300271331", "6302596092"], "also_viewed": ["6301572688", "6302596092", "6300271331"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 396077}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.18, "brand": "", "asin": "0790738945", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516WCCP833L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Lethal Weapon 4"}

{"description": "Adapted from a hit Broadway play by Robert Sherwood and starring original cast members Leslie Howard and Humphrey Bogart, this 1936 suspense drama is set in an aging desert roadhouse caf&eacute;, where a young woman (Bette Davis) dreams of escaping a dead-end existence spent with her father and a lunkheaded, would-be suitor. Along comes a penniless poet (Howard), a wanderer who has made a mess of his life and crossed the hot sands as a symbolic act of meaningful futility. Davis's waitress is instantly enchanted, and in short order they begin talking about heading out to the world together. Then a twist: the world comes to them--in the form of escaped convicts, led by the monosyllabic Duke Mantee (Bogart), who secretly agrees to the poet's request that the fugitive gangster kill him. Directed by Archie Mayo (The Great American Broadcast), much of the film, perhaps inevitably, looks set-bound. Most of the action occurs in the caf&eacute;, and the script's tension sadly dissipates a bit as villains and hostages stay glued to their seats. The film's enduring appeal has everything to do with the leading performances: the fascinating alchemy of Howard's ethereal air, Davis's sexy urgency, and Bogart's bemused menace. If the story feels a trifle dated and perhaps a bit smug, the actors make it compelling nonetheless.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301976983", "6301968948", "0790743159", "B000BWIZRW", "6301973291", "6302952581", "6302011027", "6301968891", "6302548438", "079074886X", "630254842X", "6302360978", "6300183890", "6301978110", "6303364772", "B0000068EE", "6301798503", "6301797906", "6304429274", "0792839846", "B00005Q4GZ"], "bought_together": ["6301976983"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 608098}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.59, "brand": "", "asin": "0790747219", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51PBHHMJ5YL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Petrified Forest [VHS]"}
{"description": "Thomas A. Anderson is a man living two lives. By day he is an average computer programmer and by night a hacker known as Neo. Neo has always questioned his reality, but the truth is far beyond his imagination. Neo finds himself targeted by the police when he is contacted by Morpheus, a legendary computer hacker branded a terrorist by the government. Morpheus awakens Neo to the real world, a ravaged wasteland where most of humanity have been captured by a race of machines that live off of the humans' body heat and electrochemical energy and who imprison their minds within an artificial reality known as the Matrix. As a rebel against the machines, Neo must return to the Matrix and confront the agents: super-powerful computer programs devoted to snuffing out Neo and the entire human rebellion.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JLTM", "B0001DI5W6", "0784011923", "B001FB55HQ", "0792845684", "B001DZFYPW", "0790731975", "6300271331", "B00003CXE6", "0792839846", "0792133153", "6303257844", "6303313345", "6300182304", "6303168507", "B00000JGEK", "6304071876", "6300215830", "6301963725", "0800199421", "6303398480", "6305363668", "6303202004", "079213690X", "6304258984", "B0000509BZ", "6304434170", "630018627X", "6301976622", "0783222955", "6302610702", "6302787564", "0800132009", "0767825411", "6303020089", "6301574117", "6302909023", "B000003KHS"], "bought_together": ["B00005JLTM", "B0001DI5W6"], "also_viewed": ["B001DJLD1M", "B0054509I4", "B001CEE1YE", "B00005JKCH", "6303148352", "B000AYELVA", "B001GZ6QEC", "B001JNNDBA", "B0000AXE8I", "B0001DI5W6", "6303215734", "B00005JLTM", "B0007WFX62", "6304143184", "B00005N5S5", "B001AQT0Z4", "B001FB55HQ", "B0013FBS20", "B0001BKAEY", "B000PC6A3E", "B00007ELF1", "B00005JMQW", "B0000633U4", "1880521008", "B004XKVPG6", "B00ANGID14", "B001RIY4WE", "B008M4MB8K", "B00AEFY5B6", "B00B4804KS", "B00E5I2MCM", "B005LAIHY0", "B0013FSL3E", "B00471JSRE", "B0057R5XRG", "B00E9PMMX0", "B00C3MKCF6", "B00BEZTMFY", "B00AQNOCZ0", "B00IWULSTC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 579943}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.97, "brand": "", "asin": "0790745399", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51208Z0A3HL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Matrix"}

{"description": "Novelist Leon Uris wrote the script for this Western directed by John Sturges (The Magnificent Seven) and based on the life and times of Wyatt Earp (Burt Lancaster) and his sickly companion, Doc Holliday (Kirk Douglas). The action inevitably leads to the legendary battle between the two heroes and the villainous Clanton gang, but the film is also very much about the conflicts each man faces with women, with one another, and with their own destinies. Lancaster is terrific as the downbeat Earp, and Douglas has one of his best roles as the consumptive Holliday. The thoughtfulness of the tale is matched by Sturges's captivating way with the dramatic duel. All in all, the film appeals both as a solid action piece and as a fascinating, two-character study.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305237115", "6301395395", "6301977297", "B000A9QK8M", "B0007MAO0C", "6301801733", "B00005JLUH", "6303393985", "6303257801", "6301798759", "6304111363", "0800100832", "0792107683", "6304429711", "079283853X", "0792110188", "6302718961", "0792837371", "B000056BRF", "0783222955", "B000BWIZRW", "0792106989", "079284517X", "0792838548", "6303269826", "0792110463", "6300215830", "6304457316", "B00005RRG6", "0783227221", "1558807780", "0792839846", "B00000FZCU", "6300269043", "6301805615", "6301805518", "B00000F6D1", "630152859X", "6300269639", "0784001294", "6304291698", "B00000F13T", "6301798600", "6300268799", "B00004RFFA", "6301628454", "6302503515", "B00004WZR1", "6301972341", "0767809262", "6303282237"], "bought_together": ["6301395395"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 358567}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.97, "brand": "", "asin": "079210952X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51A721QDFTL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Gunfight at the O.K.

{"description": "Let's see--he's been Han Solo in three films and Indiana Jones in three more. So why shouldn't Harrison Ford take on a new continuing character in Tom Clancy's CIA analyst Jack Ryan? In this film, directed by Phillip Noyce, Ford picked up the baton when Alec Baldwin, who played Ryan inThe Hunt for Red October, opted for a Broadway role instead. In this film, Ryan and his family are on vacation when Ryan saves a member of the British royal family from attack by Irish terrorists. The next thing he knows, the Ryan clan has been targeted by the same terrorists, who invade his Maryland home. The film can't shed all of Clancy's lumbering prose, or his techno-dweeb fascination with spy satellites and the like.

{"description": "What a combo! Tobe Hooper, the director ofThe Texas Chainsaw Massacre, teamed up with family-oriented producer Steven Spielberg to makePoltergeist. The film is about a haunted suburban tract home in a development very much like the Arizona one in which Spielberg was raised. (Because it came out the same summer as Spielberg'sE.T., it was tempting to see both movies as representing Spielberg's ambivalent feelings about childhood in suburbia. One was a fantasy, the other a nightmare.)  Spielberg also cowrote the screenplay, which taps into primal, childlike fears of monsters under the bed, monsters in the closet, sinister clown faces, and all manner of things that go bump in the night. At first, some of the odd happenings in the house are kind of funny and amusing, but they grow gradually creepier until the film climaxes in a terrifying special-effects extravaganza when 5-year-old Carole Anne (Heather O'Rourke) is kidnapped by the spooks and held hostage in another dimension. Though not nearly as frightening as Hooper's magnum opus, or the originalA Nightmare on Elm Street, which came along two years later,Poltergeistis one of the smartest and most entertaining horror pictures of its time.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00009PY4G", "B00006FDCD", "B00AEFYYH6", "B007STBUHI", "B004SIP92O", "B00004BZIY", "B000VECAD0", "B00000IQC4", "B00005A8XX", "B004LWZW24", "B001B1872U", "B009XTF8KQ", "B00386EZUY", "B000HCO86I", "B00005JOJE", "B0087F7VSY", "B001D2WU9I", "B000PMLJMQ", "B000067FP8", "B000E1P2EY", "B003PIUINI", "B0009X763M", "B000WC3864", "B003UN0752", "B002I41KNC", "B0021L8UFI", "B005GT3X68", "B000P0J0A6", "B0087ZG7PW", "B00AIBZLVY", "B0045HCJJE", "B000ASATZ8", "B0000VCZK2", "B00EZ50SGW", "B00005JNTI", "B000E33W1W", "B00008LUNW", "B00AEBBA2W", "B000CCBC9O", "B0006SGYL0", "B000FAOC2W", "B00008WFU4", "B000OA8OK4", "B00005JNNT", "B001AGXEAG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00004TDTO", "B00004BZIY", "B000VECAD0", "B00006FDCD"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 69740}, "asin": "0792833201", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31ZsC3YTJ5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Poltergeist"}
{"description": "When it was released during Hollywood's golden year of 1939,The Wizard of Ozdidn't start out as the perennial classic it has since become. The film did respectable business, but it wasn't until its debut on television that this family favorite saw its popularity soar. And whileOz's TV broadcasts are now controlled by media mogul Ted Turner (who owns the rights), the advent of home video has made this lively musical a mainstay in the staple diet of great American films. Young Dorothy Gale (Judy Garland), her dog, Toto, and her three companions on the Yellow Brick Road to Oz--the Tin Man (Jack Haley), the Cowardly Lion (Bert Lahr), and the Scarecrow (Ray Bolger)--have become pop-culture icons and central figures in the legacy of fantasy for children. As the Wicked Witch who covets Dorothy's enchanted ruby slippers, Margaret Hamilton has had the singular honor of scaring the wits out of children for more than six decades. The film's still as fresh, frightening, and funny as it was when first released. It may take some liberal detours from the original story by L. Frank Baum, but it's loyal to the Baum legacy while charting its own course as a spectacular film. Shot in glorious Technicolor, befitting its dynamic production design (Munchkinland alone is a psychedelic explosion of color and d&eacute;cor),The Wizard of Ozmay not appeal to every taste as the years go by, but it's required viewing for kids of all ages.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B005F96UJ6", "B0000VCZKM", "B00E9ZATKI", "0792839749", "B0087F7VSY", "B0090XLDKY", "B002M2Z3BA", "076781326X", "B00C7JGDBW", "B000P0J09W", "B000URDCC6", "B002HK9IDQ", "B0000DZ3EN", "B000RPCK2E", "B000065V42", "B001JV5BF8", "B0000AM6IY", "B00335EQ0E", "B005NFJAZS", "B003VS0CX8", "B0000VCZKW", "0062278010", "B002NZK5SW", "B0010X744G", "B00CQRN3QI", "B0009XT8ME", "B000HT3PGU", "B006VJ1AAI", "B00005RRG7", "B008H6GHEM", "B00GVFJ5QS", "B00HVBB140", "B002VWNIAY", "B000BT970O", "B002CLBJPK", "0060293233", "B00028HBES", "B00322XV8Q", "B00EV1YZ96", "B000AJJNIG", "B00AATV0WS", "B0054OGQM8", "1495421864", "0739060821", "B00AEFXMGU", "0792833759", "B00AMSQBNK", "B000TPTCP0", "B0009X75QU", "B00ITVMMOY", "B00005RRGB", "B0017Q0SJ4", "0767836324", "B004302N2Q", "084318017X", "B001GLX6UI", "B003YBW2Y4", "1402766254", "B00019GHU2", "B00003CXCQ", "B00AMSM9CW", "B00005JG6M", "B0047QLNUY", "B00GDT5T9Y", "B00447L4JG", "0767819659", "B00000JPH6", "B002BIGCXS", "B00G5G7EXY", "B0000AK7AB", "B006FE83UE", "B002VWNIBI", "B00005JL1P", "B001ILFUDC", "0800177258", "B000QQLVPQ", "B00005RDSQ", "B00JHH1ZN8", "B0006IINYQ", "B0015NORDW", "B002GHHHNS", "B0013ND30M", "0792838408", "B001AGXEAG", "B0047CG9F2", "B00006ADD5", "B0013FSL3E", "B00079Z9VO", "B00F6SHECS", "B0008JIJ2E", "B00CTNYLQA", "B00005JN4W"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00HVBB140", "B005F96UJ6", "B0000VCZKM", "B00I6JOD2S"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 206236}, "asin": "0792833171", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GYW80GAJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Wizard of Oz"}
{"description": "\"Something familiar, something peculiar, something for everyone: a comedy tonight!\" Those words from the opening song pretty much describe the menu inA Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum, a frantic adaptation of the stage musical by Larry Gelbart and Burt Shevelove. The wild story, set in ancient Rome, follows a slave named Pseudolus (Zero Mostel, snorting and gibbering) as he tries to extricate himself from an increasingly farcical situation; Mostel and a bevy of inspired clowns, including Phil Silvers, Jack Gilford, and Buster Keaton, keep the slapstick and the patter perking. The cast also includes the young Michael Crawford as a love-struck innocent. This project landed in the lap of Richard Lester, then one of the hottest directors in the world after his success with the Beatles' films. Lester telescoped the material through his own joke-a-second sensibility, and also ripped out some of the songs from Stephen Sondheim's Broadway score. The result is a pixilated romp and very close to the vaudeville spirit suggested by the title--though anyone with a low tolerance for Zero Mostel's overbearing buffoonery may be in trouble. Oddly enough, amidst all the frenzy, Lester creates a grungy, earthy Rome that seems closer to the real thing than countless respectable historical films on the subject.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B008SBXFUU", "B000BMY2LU", "B00001PE59", "B00003CWT3", "B000RPCK2E", "B0000068ZQ"], "bought_together": ["B008SBXFUU"], "also_viewed": ["B00402FGMG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 294428}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.74, "brand": "", "asin": "079283755X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51TGVS6F6HL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum [VHS]"}
{"description": "The first feature film to be photographed and projected in the panoramic three-camera Cinerama process, this epic Western is almost as expansive as the West itself, chronicling a pioneering family's triumphs and tragedies in numerous episodes spanning three generations and a half century of westward movement. Divided into five segments directed by veteran Hollywood filmmakers Henry Hathaway, George Marshall, and the legendary John Ford (and including uncredited sequences directed by Richard Thorpe), the film was one of the most ambitious ever made by the venerable MGM studio. Its stellar cast reads like a virtual who's who of Hollywood's biggest stars. Debbie Reynolds plays a sturdy survivor of many pioneering dangers, and the eventual widow of a gambler (Gregory Peck), who is later reunited with her nephew (George Peppard), a Civil War veteran and cavalryman who heads for San Francisco as the transcontinental railroad is being built. Many more characters and stories are woven throughout this epic film, which is dramatically uneven but totally engrossing with its stunning vistas and countless outdoor locations in Illinois, Kentucky, South Dakota, Monument Valley in Arizona, California, Colorado, and elsewhere.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00008CMT3", "B000056H2H", "B00E3QJ8DC", "B006VRRGOO", "B00AEFXUL2", "6304696612", "B00009AVA5", "B000O599Y4", "B00BXTDVEO", "B000O59A0C", "B00AEFYL6K", "B000O599ZS", "B0082LUFA4", "0783228031", "B000O77LY2", "B000O599NK", "078322592X", "B00393SG0G", "B0045HCJSK", "B000ANVPP6", "B000OT6V0U", "B00BGQ2P9G", "B00008CMR6", "B000FTCLQC", "B000O599YE", "B00008MTW5", "B0009ML2KQ", "B00AEFYPHA", "B00AEBB8YM", "B00AEBB932", "B000O599YY", "B005GZ2CWS", "B00008MTW6", "B000ANVPPQ", "B009YX8MSG", "B000G6N0HI", "B007Y1NR1W", "B000BT96DW", "B00J9BZ4KC", "B00BAXTY7G", "B00004TJQK", "B00004ZBVE", "B00AMDA2OY", "B00004XMV9", "B000O599NA", "B00E4DJK78", "B00BFWKE62", "B0007US7FI", "B000O599WQ", "0783230478", "B000O599VM", "B000059TFU", "B000NQRR34", "B00AEFYBA6", "B0009ML2JC", "B00008MTW7", "B00AEFY6ZQ", "B00C3ALLPS", "B000056H2E", "B000QRI1GW", "B000031EGW", "B000O599ZI", "B00IU6HPIQ", "B000N3T0GY", "B000O599YO", "B003ASLJRC", "B003NF97MQ", "B00FNR9YY8", "B00005PJ8S", "0792838408", "B0001Z3I0I", "B00A92MCNW", "B0007PALM0", "B00AEFXSVE", "B005AMJ38S", "B000BPL2FG", "B009INAI02", "B0014BJ1A4", "B00CFHEE08", "B00005ASGH", "B0007MANZI", "B001B187NO", "B00132D7Y0", "B004GSVX8A", "B0007MANYY", "B004DY1VIO", "B0009X75WE", "B001D7T6BI"], "bought_together": ["B00008CMT3", "B000056H2H"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00BXTDVEO", "B00J9BZ4KC", "B000056H2H", "B00IU6HPIQ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 315351}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 30.49, "brand": "", "asin": "0792839072", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61HH9Y5XTJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "How the West Was Won"}

{"description": "Based on Thomas Harris's novel, this terrifying film by Jonathan Demme really only contains a couple of genuinely shocking moments (one involving an autopsy, the other a prison break). The rest of the film is a splatter-free visual and psychological descent into the hell of madness, redeemed astonishingly by an unlikely connection between a monster and a haunted young woman. Anthony Hopkins is extraordinary as the cannibalistic psychiatrist Dr. Hannibal Lecter, virtually entombed in a subterranean prison for the criminally insane. At the behest of the FBI, agent-in-training Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) approaches Lecter, requesting his insights into the identity and methods of a serial killer named Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine). In exchange, Lecter demands the right to penetrate Starling's most painful memories, creating a bizarre but palpable intimacy that liberates them both under separate but equally horrific circumstances. Demme, a filmmaker with a uniquely populist vision (Melvin and Howard,Something Wild), also spent his early years making pulp for Roger Corman (Caged Heat), and he hasn't forgotten the significance of tone, atmosphere, and the unsettling nature of a crudely effective close-up. Much of the film, in fact, consists of actors staring straight into the camera (usually from Clarice's point of view), making every bridge between one set of eyes to another seem terribly dangerous.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005LKIM", "6302054982", "B00008AOS5", "B00005PJ8I", "B000007OY0", "6302800420", "0790705141", "B00003CXE6", "6301179552", "6301427076", "B000003KHS", "6300989003", "6303402348", "B0000633ZP", "B00005ATQA"], "bought_together": ["6302054982"], "also_viewed": ["6305363668", "6302415853", "0792116887", "079213690X", "0800103106", "6305750750"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 331980}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.0, "brand": "", "asin": "0792842111", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4117Q86BS0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Silence of the Lambs [VHS]"}

{"description": "This unusually beautiful horror classic features Vincent Price in the  title role of Dr. Anton Phibes, a genius who specializes in organ music, theology, and concocting bizarre deaths for anyone who wrongs him. Discovering why is half the fun, so for now let's just say that Phibes is a little mad and very, very angry. With his assistant, the lovely, silent Vulnavia, Phibes begins cutting a gory swath through London's medical community, with the dogged Inspector Trout hot on his tail.Phibescontains many pleasures--exquisite art direction and a dark sense of humor among them--but the real treat is in watching an old pro like Price at work. Whether he's playing his organ, staring down a victim, or drinking through his neck, Price is at the top of his game. He mixes dark menace with wry comic touches, revealing both Phibes's maniacal obsession and offhanded confidence in his own genius.

{"description": "Cliffhangerwas a 1994 comeback of sorts for action hero Sylvester Stallone, this time thanks to director Renny Harlin (Die Hard 2andNightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master) and some spectacularly rugged and vertigo-inducing high- mountain terrain.

{"description": "IfBuffy the Vampire Slayerrepresents the lighter side of high school as a macabre experience, here's a movie that asks the burning question, &quot;What happens when angst-ridden teenagers develop supernatural powers?&quot; More to the point, how do four outcast teenaged witches handle their ability to cast wicked spells on the taunting classmates who've nicknamed them &quot;The Bitches of Eastwick&quot;? The answer, of course, is &quot;don't get mad, get even.&quot; That's about all there is to this terminally silly movie, which makes up for its ludicrous plot by letting its young female cast have a field day as they indulge their dark fantasies. Fairuza Balk is enjoyable as the most wicked of the witches, and is therefore the focus of the film's most dazzling special effects. But it's Neve Campbell from television'sParty of Fivewho made this film a modest box-office hit, just before she became her generation's fright-movie favorite inScreamand its popular sequel.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002NZK5V4", "B00441GYVK", "B000FFJYBG", "B000K4WPCC", "6305428042", "078322933X", "B00001PE4D", "B0053TWVQ4", "B002O3Z4VG", "1567184464", "6305428425", "B004P7CN7W", "B004SIP9MY", "B002GOAH10", "B000A5045Q", "B003HKN52U", "B00447L4KA", "B0012GN2XI", "B00094ARJ6", "0783225482", "B000056T5E", "B00003CXMP", "B002XUBDRY", "B00002SSKI", "B00DW5IKYS", "B000BYA5HS", "6305821216", "B001AGXEAG", "B00AEFXO8Q", "B00005J761", "B004LWZW2O", "B005CFBYW6", "B00005JKJS", "B0000524E5", "B00003CWQR", "B000083C6I", "B00AJCUL2G", "B000069I1I", "B000A2X3U2", "B00A2H9L2E", "B0000714BP", "B0009MWEM6", "B00000IQW4", "B004SUDQ1I", "B00027JZ3E", "0767824954", "B000HD1482", "B00005JNY3", "B00AEBBA2W", "B00013RC2K", "1558908315", "B00JPQ1HX4", "B00005RHGK", "B00009WVSL", "B000GCFO0I", "B0016MJ6T2", "B00AEFYM2S", "B00001QGUM", "B00004RF85", "0792840127", "B0021L8UPS", "B00004Z4WR", "B00005JLH0", "0767808673", "B00005K3NR", "B00BSU0FQA", "B0001GF2D8", "B00000F0AD", "0767837398", "B00003CXPS", "B000021Y7E", "B000V4UFZK", "B000BX0VT6", "B002USF1WC", "B004SIP9O2", "6305428271", "B000AM4P9K", "6305065551", "B003VA3JUO", "B0036TGSIK", "B00441GYVA", "B000GYI3B8", "B0041KKYEM", "B00DMDE02Q", "B004SEUJ9Q", "B0000AC8LI", "B000RIWAVW", "B000HC2M0C", "B0001EFV7M", "B00000G3PA", "B007I6JZVE", "B00013RC7K", "B002VWNIDG", "B00AEFXPG2", "B000K7VHLY", "B000FGGE68", "B000H5TH0W", "B00AMEZDJW", "B009AMAGQM", "B0085A9HU6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002NZK5V4", "6305428425", "B00441GYVK", "B00447L4KA"]}, "price": 4.85, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 244555}, "asin": "0800141644", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HC5C2JHDL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Craft"}
{"description": "One of the best romantic comedies of the 1990s, this box-office hit cemented writer-director Cameron Crowe's reputation as &quot;the voice of a generation.&quot; Crowe could probably do without that label, but he's definitely in sync with the times with this savvy story about a sports agent (Tom Cruise) whose fall from grace motivates his quest for professional recovery, and the slow-dawning realization that he needs the love and respect of the single mom (Ren&eacute;e Zellweger in her breakthrough role) who has supported him through the worst of times. This is one of Cruise's best, most underrated performances, and in an Oscar-winning role, Cuba Gooding Jr. plays the football star who remains Jerry Maguire's only loyal client on a hard road to redemption and personal growth. If that sounds touchy-feely, it is only because Crowe has combined sharp entertainment with a depth of character that is rarely found in mainstream comedy.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000065V3G", "B0000YEEGM", "B000GAKDAG", "0767811100", "B0018QPPXW", "B0002WZTOI", "B00005B6JZ", "B00AEFXR1K", "B004SIP7ZS", "B00AEBB9WI", "0783226810", "B00081U7HC", "B00AEFY4CG", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00AEFXYJA", "B000XJD33O", "B00AEBB9LO", "B000G6BLHY", "B0068FZ0GK", "B000023VTP", "B004SEUJK0", "B00158K0QU", "B000MNOX94", "B00AEFXESQ", "B001ECDVK4", "B000957O82", "B0000DIXDR", "0780631536", "0783225733", "B00004W221", "B000EGDB10", "B0010YSD8Q", "B000056VP4", "630471193X", "B00005JG6N", "B000P0J0EW", "B00005JL78", "0800141806", "B00005JKG9", "0790730979", "B002VECM6S", "B0000AOV4I", "B000CCBCAS", "B000HRMAPE", "B0006GANPA", "6305236569", "B00005O5CM", "B00011CZRE", "B0038Z5T4Q", "B000053VB4", "B003ASLJQS", "B0000524E4", "B00AEFXE9U", "B00006ZXSL", "078324021X", "B000765IJK", "B00AEFY99O", "B00AEBB8NS", "B0002V7ON8", "B00015YVDG", "B002AT8KD8", "B007SPPANM", "0783233477", "B000035Z5G", "B007STBUHI", "B004SIP9U6", "B000E5N684", "B00AEFXYOA", "B001LGXIA6", "B002GOAGZC", "B000FI8MPW", "B002O3Z510", "B000N6U0E2", "B000069HZP", "B00AEFY5B6", "B000068NNU", "B00001ZWUS", "B004AOECXI", "B00AEFXN9G", "B000YDBPAM", "B002ZG9864", "B003QO8TOQ", "0792843592", "B0013FCWUW", "B000P0J0EM", "B000QQLVPQ", "B000HEWEE4", "B0001AVZA8", "B00000G3PA", "B000XT1P3E", "B0006N2EZ0", "B00008G8LM", "B00005JNTI", "6304765266", "B00AEFXT1S", "B003UESJHO", "B00004WG2F", "B00005T7HW", "B004L3AR0K", "6305128952"], "bought_together": ["B0002WZTOI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001680M26", "B0002WZTOI", "0792838467", "B000065V3G"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 8726}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.0, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "0800141741", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51KBVJ813VL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Jerry Maguire"}
{"description": "The Obama Deception is a hard-hitting film that completely destroys the myth that Barack Obama is working for the best interests of the American people.\n\nThe Obama phenomenon is a hoax carefully crafted by the captains of the New World Order. He is being pushed as savior in an attempt to con the American people into accepting global slavery.\n\nWe have reached a critical juncture in the New World Order's plans. It's not about Left or Right: it's about a One World Government. The international banks plan to loot the people of the United States and turn them into slaves on a Global Plantation.\n\nCovered in this film: who Obama works for, what lies he has told, and his real agenda. If you want to know the facts and cut through all the hype, this is the film for you.\n\nWatch The Obama Deception and learn how:\n\n - Obama is continuing the process of transforming America into something that resembles Nazi Germany, with forced National Service, domestic civilian spies, warrantless wiretaps, the destruction of the Second Amendment, FEMA camps and Martial Law.\n\n - Obama's handlers are openly announcing the creation of a new Bank of the World that will dominate every nation on earth through carbon taxes and military force.\n\n - International bankers purposefully engineered the worldwide financial meltdown to bankrupt the nations of the planet and bring in World Government.\n\n - Obama plans to loot the middle class, destroy pensions and federalize the states so that the population is completely dependent on the Central Government.\n\n - The Elite are using Obama to pacify the public so they can usher in the North American Union by stealth, launch a new Cold War and continue the occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nThe information contained in this film is vital to the future of the Republic and to freedom worldwide. President Barack Obama is only the tool of a larger agenda. Until all are made aware, humanity will remain captive to the masters of the New World Order.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0094V8OXG", "B003Z3CZGG", "B000VSDNHS", "B003H23KSM", "B007XW07CO", "B002LFPBK6", "B003H3CKLO", "B002RXAER2", "B000RZIH6W", "B00LG7VVPO", "B009SVANG8", "B0018IPKCG", "B0085DYC94", "B008H6GHKG", "B000QGE89W", "1930004621", "B000JVSUSE", "B006074Q3O", "1596987782", "B00LG7VWIA", "B002FOQY7M", "162157203X", "B00443YDWK", "B009YA5JMG", "1930004540", "B00443XONE", "B006T5JZ4M", "B00483VQTE", "B000HRJLM4", "B009S93GQE", "B000SARIKC", "B002FG9NF0", "B001U2F7K0", "B000RMOF8O", "B000GB5MEC", "1621573133", "B006J1OCHG", "B004OOQMIC", "B001KWB0L0", "B00DYC648S", "1878859900", "B008QEQF10", "B000RWCAAY", "0979988624", "B00102F5YS", "1596987774", "1596986255", "B002EP8TQG", "1936488574", "193690618X", "1936488191", "1936488051", "B008BU31FW", "B00F58L0XS", "B00914YLAG", "1476773351", "B00DD5R89U", "1480584932", "1451698097", "0615716474", "B001NMT8R0", "B006GS7R1K", "093616316X", "B00KDK64DY", "1621570118", "B00CS9NZCQ", "B0011TX1RI", "B00KD5HFJG", "B00315I6DE", "1475192037", "1594037760", "B000PE0GQO", "B006H37OQC", "B00404GBF0", "1615774319", "1497456045", "159403558X", "B002D8KT9O", "B00005UF7J", "0983745684", "1596980990", "B003CJXJ8Q", "B00BOZQ54K", "B00A2WLVZO", "B0096DP4CG", "1621572420", "0615354963", "B00DZSWI4A", "1476773882", "B00GSXE0B8", "B001EAWMB0", "B002WLS890", "1595231129", "B008XAYWS0", "B002HSD0J6", "B00347ZYFM", "B00IXQV34U", "1594033773", "B00744WZ8U"], "bought_together": ["B0094V8OXG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0094V8OXG", "B003Z3CZGG", "162157203X", "B00DTP0QVQ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 14185}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 19.95, "brand": "", "asin": "093085280X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51m651vGwXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Obama Deception: The Mask Comes Off"}

An Inconvenient Truth records a multi-media presentation hosted by Gore in which he discusses the scientific facts behind global warming, explains how it has already begun to affect our environment, talks about the disastrous consequences if the world's governments and citizens do not act, and shares what each individual can do to help protect the Earth for this and future generations.

{"description": "Considered by many to be the greatest B&nbsp;movie ever made, the original-release version of Orson Welles's film noir masterpieceTouch of Evilwas, ironically, never intended as a B&nbsp;movie at all--it merely suffered that fate after it was taken away from writer-director Welles, then reedited and released in 1958 as the second half of a double feature. Time and critical acclaim would eventually elevate the film to classic status (and Welles's original vision was meticulously followed for the film's 1998 restoration), but for four decades this original version stood as a testament to Welles's directorial genius. From its astonishing, miraculously choreographed opening shot (lasting over three minutes) to Marlene Dietrich's classic final line of dialogue, this sordid tale of murder and police corruption is like a valentine for the cinematic medium, with Welles as its love-struck suitor. As the corpulent cop who may be involved in a border-town murder, Welles faces opposition from a narcotics officer (Charlton Heston) whose wife (Janet Leigh) is abducted and held as the pawn in a struggle between Heston's quest for truth and Welles's control of carefully hidden secrets. The twisting plot is wildly entertaining (even though it's harder to follow in this original version), but even greater pleasure is found in the pulpy dialogue and the sheer exuberance of the dazzling directorial style.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302281849", "B001BZQMFA", "0783236352", "1558807780", "0783221347", "0782008348", "630266232X", "630347327X", "6305012792", "6302655897", "6302413400", "6302413435"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 403157}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.88, "brand": "", "asin": "1558804226", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51G3Y343C4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Touch of Evil [VHS]"}
{"description": "On the strength of his Hitchcockian-thriller debut,Mute Witness, writer-director Anthony Waller was hired to direct this belated sequel to the 1981 horror comedyAn American Werewolf in London, but lycanthropy in the City of Light just ain't what it used to be. The movie offers plenty of gruesome makeup and special wolf-transformation effects, and there are some effectively spooky moments in the plot involving an underground population of hungry Parisian werewolves. One of them is seductively played by Julie Delpy, who is rescued from attempted suicide by an American tourist (Tom Everett Scott, fromThat Thing You Do!) but ultimately can't hide her dual identity when darkness falls and the full moon shines. The movie begins well, but gradually succumbs to nonsense and mayhem, prompting critic Roger Ebert to observe that &quot;here are people we don't care about, doing things they don't understand, in a movie without any rules.&quot; In other words, you'd have to be a die-hard horror buff to give this one the benefit of the doubt.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0024FADD8", "B002HWUU9U", "B004P7CN3G", "B000A2X3U2", "0800177029", "B003WTO5NO", "B001AR0D5Y", "B0002I84DK", "B000U1ZV7Q", "B000RW5BZ0", "B0001EFV7M", "B000P0J056", "B00AEBB91E", "B001GCUO0W", "B005CA4SEC", "6305258287", "B00023BM4S", "B000Q66Q56", "B00KM5F31O", "B004P7CN7W", "B00AEFYV9W", "B00441GYVA", "B00005LC4O", "B005CFBZWK", "B00L4K3MLE", "B00009OWI1", "B00AEBB9AA", "B000AM6OQ2", "B002DKGWUC", "0767817664", "B005TG8156", "B000OCY7TY", "B00JJOY496", "B00HRCBGRA", "B004SUDQCW", "B000000OL8", "B00005UQ9W", "0783232039", "B00AEBBA72", "B0002DB54A", "B000IJ79TS", "B008OR5X4O", "B000GI3RGK", "B00005O439", "B00008AOVO", "B0001Z37HM", "B00IKM5LXG", "B003EYVXSW", "B00005NB8U", "B003I7BXM6", "0767824954", "B00JF5GAZA", "B00K6D1HSK", "B001B1UO6W", "B00AEBBA2W", "0780619951", "B00FQPLZ08", "B00JHH1VSW", "B00006FDBT", "B00006FD9N", "B0002KVUKM", "B00070FX5U", "B0000E2R6P", "B009IV2Z3M", "6305308810", "B00IJS2OXG", "B000TGJ80S", "B0002CHK1S", "B0053TWW1I", "B00018D3UU", "B0002KQNL8", "B000A5045Q", "6305588236", "B000099T3U", "B004AC6PMG", "B00D9EJG54", "B002LMSWN2", "B000TUDBFM", "B0053TWVA0", "1573628174", "B00003CWRF", "B000MV8AC2", "B005CFBZ8O", "B000TLTCR2", "B00IYJRIKO", "B00008LUNW", "B000GBEWRU", "B00A1AU72A", "B0002S9QT6", "B00E56GB12", "B001ECDVKE", "B005J9ZFQG", "B000HC2M0C", "B008OR5X6W", "B002NZK5U0", "B000VSDNFA", "B000069HZO", "B006ZGROB6", "B000BTIU4S", "B00006CXGP"], "bought_together": ["B0024FADD8", "B00AEBB91E"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0024FADD8", "B00009OWI1", "B001GCUO0W", "B000RW5BZ0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 15595}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.69, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "155890848X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZTANHEYML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "An American Werewolf in Paris"}

Mulligan brings taste and honesty to the film, and Alda and Burstyn give full, living performances.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00004W46I", "6300182541", "B0007QJ1XE", "0783235593", "6300984869"], "bought_together": ["B00004W46I"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 258354}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.45, "brand": "Universal Studios", "asin": "6300182282", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/414F8JS3Y0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Same Time Next Year [VHS]"}

{"description": "The classic science fiction novel by Ray Bradbury was a curious choice for one of the leading directors of the French New Wave, Fran&ccedil;ois Truffaut. But from the opening credits onward (spoken, not written on screen), Truffaut takes Bradbury's fascinating premise and makes it his own. The futuristic society depicted inFahrenheit 451is a culture without books. Firemen still race around in red trucks and wear helmets, but their job is to start fires: they ferret out forbidden stashes of books, douse them with gasoline, and make public bonfires. Oskar Werner, the star of Truffaut'sJules and Jim, plays a fireman named Montag, whose exposure toDavid Copperfieldwakens an instinct toward reading and individual thought. (That's why books are banned--they give people too many ideas.) In an intriguing casting flourish, Julie Christie plays two roles: Montag's bored, drugged-up wife and the woman who helps kindle the spark of rebellion. The great Bernard Herrmann wrote the hard-driving music; Nicolas Roeg provided the cinematography.Fahrenheit 451received a cool critical reception and has never quite been accepted by Truffaut fans or sci-fi buffs. Its deliberately listless manner has always been a problem, although that is part of its point; the lack of reading has made people dry and empty. If the movie is a bit stiff (Truffaut did not speak English well and never tried another project in English), it nevertheless is full of intriguing touches, and the ending is lyrical and haunting.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792839846"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 113753}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 18.74, "brand": "MCA Universal", "asin": "6300184250", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5122B7MF89L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Fahrenheit 451 [VHS]"}

{"description": "After Hammer Studios rewrote the histories of Frankenstein, Dracula, and the Mummy it was only natural to take on the howling hirsute one. Discarding the cursed gypsies, blooming wolfsbane, and chanted legends that swirl through Universal'sThe Wolf Man, director Terence Fisher and screenwriter John Elder (a pseudonym for producer Anthony Hinds) returned to Guy Endore's novelThe Werewolf of Parisfor inspiration. Switching locations to 18th-century Spain (to make use of standing sets from a canceled production about the Spanish Inquisition), this is a story of sex, sadism, and decadence, a curse produced from human evil. Young orphan Leon, the progeny of a mad, animalistic prisoner and a ravaged young peasant, is plagued with nightmares while village sheep are slaughtered, but it isn't until he grows into the stocky young Oliver Reed that his curse takes its terrifying toll. Reed cuts an intense figure as the brooding, serious young man and makes a marvelous werewolf, moving with a boxer's grace under feral makeup that looks as much ape as canine.Curse of the Werewolfhas all the cleavage and blood you'd expect from a Hammer film, but it's Fisher's eerie touches that make the film so gripping: a dog's howl anticipates the crying of the newborn Leon, holy water ripples as if coming to a boil before his christening, and the wild-eyed, fanged boy struggles against the bars in his room consumed in a canine bloodlust.--Sean Axmaker", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 309104}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "title": "Curse of Werewolf [VHS]", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B0009X770O", "B0067LXQA2", "B001B9ZVVC"]}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51S1S3RGTSL._SY300_.jpg", "asin": "6300185869"}
{"description": "The debut film of director Joel Coen and his brother-producer Ethan Coen, 1983'sBlood Simpleis grisly comic noir that marries the feverish toughness of pulp thrillers with the ghoulishness of even pulpier horror. (Imagine the novels of Jim Thompson somehow fused with the comic tabloidWeird Tales, and you get the idea.) The story concerns a Texas bar owner (Dan Hedaya) who hires a seedy private detective (M. Emmett Walsh) to follow his cheating wife (Frances McDormand in her first film appearance), and then kill her and her lover (John Getz). The gumshoe turns the tables on his client, and suddenly a bad situation gets much, much worse, with some violent goings-on that are as elemental as they are shocking. (A scene in which a character who has been buried alive suddenly emerges from his own grave instantly becomes an archetypal nightmare.) Shot by Barry Sonnenfeld before he became an A-list director in Hollywood,Blood Simpleestablished the hyperreal look and feel of the Coens' productions (undoubtedly inspired a bit by filmmaker Sam Raimi, whoseThe Evil Deadhad just been coedited by Joel). Sections of the film have proved to be an endurance test for art-house movie fans, particularly an extended climax that involves one shock after another but ends with a laugh at the absurdity of criminal ambition.

A sort of urban Western with a comic-book pace, artificial colors, fable-like tone, and broad acting, the film isn't intended to steep us in gritty realities so much as spin a decadent fantasy out of them.

{"description": "That Oscar-winning title song buzzes in your ears long after the movie has stopped. The attraction here is youthful spirit and a pulsating score, because the weak story is merely a conduit for the song-and-dance numbers. The plot is every young woman's daydream come true. Jennifer Beals holds down a macho job as a welder by day, but performs erotic dance numbers in a club at night. It's not a strip club, so her morality remains intact. She dates her wealthy boss (Michael Nouri) and practices hard for the day she can audition for the upscale, local dance school, even though she has no formal training. It is malarkey, of course, unless you view this as total romantic fantasy. It works because you are carried along by the sheer force of the energetic, boisterous, MTV-style imagery by director Adrian Lyne. Beals is a plus as the stubborn, pouty, somewhat eccentric young woman made all the more interesting for her driving ambition. In the end, she is aided by her Prince Charming, who arrives bearing favors. Mind you, this is not the same as a rescue, as Beals is one rather tough damsel who does just fine on her own.--Rochelle O'Gorman", "related": {"also_bought": ["630287789X", "6300263673", "6300183211", "6300182916", "6300213668", "0792100085"], "bought_together": ["B000009CMK"], "also_viewed": ["6300263673"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 175909}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.45, "brand": "", "asin": "6300214184", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51K5Z4QMFFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Flashdance [VHS]"}
{"description": "This splatter flick, along with John Carpenter'sHalloween, helped spawn the great horror-movie movement of the '80s, not to mentioneightsequels, many of which had nothing to do with the films that preceded them.

Forever duplicated, the originalFriday the 13thpopularized a number of themes and techniques that today are now clich&eacute;s: the increasingly gory murders, the remote forest location, the anonymous and nubile cast, the murderer as cult hero, and, of course, the moral that if you have sex, you will die, very painfully. Still, if you have to see aFriday the 13thmovie, this is the one to check out. A group of eager (and horny) teenagers decide to reopen Camp Crystal Lake, which 20 years earlier was closed after the shocking and mysterious murders of two amorous camp counselors. You can take it from there, as the teens get picked off one by one, during a dark and stormy night; of course, their car won't start and there's no phone. The ending stole shamelessly from Brian De Palma'sCarrie, but it still provides a slight if campy shock. Look for a young Kevin Bacon as the requisite stud--you can tell that's what he is because when the cast appears in swimsuits, he's wearing a Speedo--who's the beneficiary of the film's best murder sequence, an arrowhead to the throat.

{"description": "The movie that made \"No wire hangers!\" a household phrase,Mommie Dearestis the very model of a modern \"camp classic,\" so crazily outlandish that it's fascinating. Based on the scathing and scandalous tell-all bestseller by Christina Crawford, the adopted daughter of histrionic Hollywood movie queen Joan Crawford,Mommie Dearestwas billed in advance as a serious dramatic motion-picture biography. But it turned out to be something much, much weirder--a genuine Hollywood oddity that serves up a bizarre mixture of melodramatic trash and outrageous tragi-comedy. Joan Crawford won an Oscar for playing the role of the self-sacrificing mother, the woman who would do anything for her daughter, inMildred Pierce. As depicted by Faye Dunaway (playing the hell out of the role as if she's determined to win another Oscar of her own, damn it!), her role as offscreen parent puts her in a league with big-time scary screen mommies such as Mrs. Bates inPsycho, and Angela Lansbury's &uuml;ber-mom inThe Manchurian Candidate. Dunaway's Crawford torments and terrorizes her adopted children in myriad ways--making them give away their own birthday gifts and rousting them from their beds for frantic after-midnight bathroom-scrubbing attacks. And when, after the death of her Pepsico chairman husband, Crawford tells the board of directors, \"Don't f--- with me, fellas!\" one is very much inclined to heed her warning.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301706587", "6301977963", "B004LWZW4M", "B000005XPV", "6304359721", "6301973410", "B000003KE0", "B00005RERY"], "bought_together": ["6301977963"], "also_viewed": ["0767903579"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 304567}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.67, "brand": "", "asin": "6300213919", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51N957ZKB0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Mommie Dearest [VHS]"}
{"description": "The quintessential movie spoof that spawned an entire genre of parody films, the originalAirplane!still holds up as one of the brightest comedic gems of the '80s, not to mention of cinema itself (it ranked in the top 5 ofEntertainment Weekly's list of the 100 funniest movies ever made). The humor may be low and obvious at times, but the jokes keep coming at a rapid-fire clip and its targets--primarily the lesser lights of '70s cinema, from disco films to star-studded disaster epics--are more than worthy for send-up. If you've seen even one of the overblownAirportmovies then you know the plot: the crew of a filled-to-capacity jetliner is wiped out and it's up to a plucky stewardess and a shell-shocked fighter pilot to land the plane. Robert Hays and Julie Hagerty are the heroes who have a history that includes a meet-cute &agrave; laSaturday Night Fever, a surf scene right out ofFrom Here to Eternity, a Peace Corps trip to Africa to teach the natives the benefits of Tupperware and basketball, a war-ravaged recovery room with a G.I. who thinks he's Ethel Merman (a hilarious cameo)--and those are just the flashbacks! The jokes gleefully skirt the boundaries of bad taste (pilot Peter Graves to a juvenile cockpit visitor: \"Joey, have you ever seen a grown man naked?\"), with the high (low?) point being Hagerty's intimate involvement with the blow-up automatic pilot doll, but they'll have you rolling on the floor. The film launched the careers of collaborators Jim Abrahams (Big Business), David Zucker (Ruthless People), and Jerry Zucker (Ghost), as well as revitalized such B-movie actors as Lloyd Bridges, Peter Graves, Robert Stack, and Leslie Nielsen, who built a second career on films like this.

{"description": "In the tradition of such obsessively driven directors as Erich von Stroheim and Werner Herzog, Francis Ford Coppola approached the production ofApocalypse Nowas if it were his own epic mission into the heart of darkness. On location in the storm-ravaged Philippines, he quite literally went mad as the project threatened to devour him in a vortex of creative despair, but from this insanity came one of the greatest films ever made. It began as a John Milius screenplay, transposing Joseph Conrad's classic story \"Heart of Darkness\" into the horrors of the Vietnam War, following a battle-weary Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) on a secret upriver mission to find and execute the renegade Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), who has reverted to a state of murderous and mystical insanity. The journey is fraught with danger involving wartime action on epic and intimate scales. One measure of the film's awesome visceral impact is the number of sequences, images, and lines of dialogue that have literally burned themselves into our cinematic consciousness, from the Wagnerian strike of helicopter gunships on a Vietnamese village to the brutal murder of stowaways on a peasant sampan and the unflinching fearlessness of the surfing warrior Lieutenant Colonel Kilgore (Robert Duvall), who speaks lovingly of \"the smell of napalm in the morning.\" Like Herzog'sAguirre: The Wrath of God, this film is the product of genius cast into a pit of hell and emerging, phoenix-like, in triumph. Coppola's obsession (effectively detailed in the riveting documentaryHearts of Darkness, directed by Coppola's wife, Eleanor) informs every scene and every frame, and the result is a film for the ages.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301115430", "630018627X", "0790701251", "6300183211", "6303686796", "6305363668", "079284646X", "6304935811", "0784011923", "6303953425", "0792836510", "6302822688", "B000003KHS", "630021639X", "6304119046", "B00003CXE6", "6302610702", "0792158261", "B000K7VHQE", "6303036570", "6303020089", "6303651488", "0800125762", "B004LWZW9W", "B00000JGEI", "0790705141", "6302360978", "6302415853", "0783107986", "B00005ATQA", "630336568X", "0790731975", "6305095566", "6300216500", "6301662954", "6302921058", "6300246965", "6300182878", "0800100832", "B00005JKEC", "6304286961", "B000062XM6", "0784011575", "630197154X", "B00004TYS8", "B00004WIDB", "6304414099", "0800116917", "6302517036", "0800199421", "6304259131", "0783202253", "6303109950", "6303313345", "B00006C7G9", "0792837312", "6302482712", "6300213986", "6303421563", "6304039549", "B000065U6Q", "B0000A36J1", "6300182770", "B00004CNR5", "6304025831", "6303422020", "0790748169", "0800132009"], "bought_together": ["6301115430", "0790701251"], "also_viewed": ["6303953425", "6305363668", "6305750750", "B00000J2KZ", "6303506291", "6303314015"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 172447}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.75, "brand": "", "asin": "6300214826", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41EFVS37MRL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Apocalypse Now [VHS]"}
{"description": "Written for the stage and coherently opened up for the screen by veteran director Herbert Ross,Play It Again, Samis closer to a conventional comedy than Woody Allen's more self-contained films, but his smart script and archetypal hero-nebbish achieve a special charm aimed squarely at movie buffs. Allen is Allan Felix, a film critic on the rebound after his wife's desertion trying to brave the choppy waters of born-again bachelorhood and struggling to reconcile his celluloid obsessions with the hazards of real-world dating. His apartment is a shrine to Humphrey Bogart, and it's none other than Bogey himself who materializes at strategic moments to counsel Allan on romantic strategy. He gets more corporeal aid from his married friends, Linda (Diane Keaton) and Dick (Tony Roberts), who try to orchestrate prospective matches and reassure him when those chemistry experiments explode. When Allan finds himself falling in love with Linda, the dissonance between fantasy and reality proves both funny and poignant--a precursor to the deeper emotionalism missing from the star's earlier directorial efforts that was soon to inform Allen's most affecting '70s comedies. It's also the start of his onscreen relationship with Keaton, further underscoring Allen's evolution toward a more satisfying contemplation of the friction between head and heart.--Sam Sutherland", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000BWMEIS", "6301972147", "6301963911", "B0000068DV", "6304196806", "6303011411", "6301971922", "B000NNOYH4", "6300183513", "6303686761", "6300150151", "B00005AUJL", "6301967658", "6302779480"], "bought_together": ["B000BWMEIS"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 341486}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 15.41, "brand": "", "asin": "6300216365", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51B8XDZQC1L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Play It Again, Sam [VHS]"}
{"description": "In retrospect, George Seaton's adaptation ofThe Country Girlseems like the movie that was made to prove that both Bing Crosby and Grace Kelly couldact. The tale of an alcoholic actor and singer (Crosby) and his long-suffering wife (Kelly) whose marriage is put to the test when he gets a second chance at stardom, Clifford Odets' drama is chock full of twists and turns designed to give actors a grueling workout, with its hidden secrets, tortured love story, and frank depiction of the horrors of alcohol abuse. Crosby and Kelly sank their teeth into the meaty roles with gusto (it helped that a rock-solid William Holden was there for each to spark off of), and both were showered with accolades that remained high points of their careers. Crosby was lauded with kudos for turning his charming persona inside-out, but it was Kelly who stole the show, possibly because at the time she was one of the hardest working women in show business. In 1954, the actress appeared in four films, including the Alfred Hitchcock classicsDial M for MurderandRear Window, and finally ascended to leading-lady status after her stellar supporting turns inHigh NoonandMogambo. In typical Hollywood fashion, though, it was only when Kelly shrouded her breathtaking beauty in plain clothes and a dowdy hairdo that she was taken seriously and awarded a Best Actress Oscar--one of the most highly contested ever, as she beat out comeback star Judy Garland's ferocious performance inA Star Is Born.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792837649", "B000003KE0", "0792839846", "6300215695", "6300215741", "0782008348", "0792110269", "6301586026"], "bought_together": ["0792837649"], "also_viewed": ["630197879X"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 408172}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.75, "brand": "", "asin": "6300215660", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4120G3A9TKL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Country Girl [VHS]"}
{"description": "The wartime memories of surviving World War II bomber squadrons were still crystal clear when this acclaimed drama was released in 1949--one of the first postwar films out of Hollywood to treat the war on emotionally complex terms. Framed by a postwar prologue and epilogue and told as a flashback appreciation of wartime valor and teamwork, the film stars Gregory Peck in one of his finest performances as a callous general who assumes command of a bomber squadron based in England. At first, the new commander has little rapport with the 918th Bomber Group, whose loyalties still belong with their previous commander. As they continue to fly dangerous missions over Germany, however, the group and their new leader develop mutual respect and admiration, until the once-alienated commander feels that his men are part of a family--men whose bravery transcends the rigors of rigid discipline and by-the-book leadership. The film's now-classic climax, in which the general waits patiently for his squad to return to base--painfully aware that they may not return at all--is one of the most subtle yet emotionally intense scenes of any World War II drama. With Peck in the lead and Dean Jagger doing Oscar-winning work in a crucial supporting role, this was one of veteran director Henry King's proudest achievements, and it still packs a strong dramatic punch.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301736362", "0792838556", "6301977289", "6302224462", "B00000F13T", "B00005Q4GY", "6302226899", "6300246965", "0783226152", "6303057225", "B0007TKNGA", "B0001WTWWE", "6300181472", "0792116887", "B0001NBMH6", "B00AEFYBA6", "0792837959", "6301967593", "B00005PJ8S", "6302909023", "6301979761", "0790733390", "6301798503", "B00005A1VH", "6303562248", "6301976924", "1558807780", "B0072GPQNG", "6300208281", "630299005X", "6304196954", "6302360978", "6301662954", "0782006779", "6300268748", "0800132009", "6302862906", "6302227135", "6304457316", "6302756472", "6301798708", "6301734734", "B000006N70", "630021639X", "6301564456", "6301976622", "6304071876", "6300246868", "0800100832", "0792102320", "B000M7BEPQ", "6302413435", "6301967410", "6300185192", "6303491006", "6301978390", "6301802330", "6300269795", "6304458975", "6300216217", "6302208912", "6302308208", "B000BWIZTU", "6303120474"], "bought_together": ["6301977289", "6301736362"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 322550}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.89, "brand": "", "asin": "6300247090", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51MXD828JFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Twelve O'Clock High [VHS]"}

The town's eccentric inhabitants, eventful night sky, and stunning scenery soak into his psyche and combine to bring a very different Mac to the surface, a Mac who collects seashells, walks on the beach in his jeans instead of his suit, and throws his calendar watch, beeping \"meeting time in Houston,\" into the sea.Mac eventually vies to switch places with Gordon Urquhart--accountant, bartender, innkeeper, and community representative in the land deal. After an evening spent drinking 42-year-old scotch (\"old enough to be out on its own,\" Mac chirps, and then laughs smugly at his own joke) and negotiating the real estate deal, Mac tries to negotiate a deal for himself--to trade his high-rise Houston apartment, Porsche, and oil-company job for Urquhart's less traditional, but more fulfilling, life.The plot runs along almost as if behind the scenes, and the characters are intriguing, but the real appeal here is the incisive yet gentle humor.

{"description": "Michael Douglas won an Oscar for perfectly embodying the Reagan-era credo that \"greed is good.\" As a Donald Trump-like Wall Street raider aptly named Gordon Gecko (for his reptilian ability to attack corporate targets and swallow them whole), Douglas found a role tailor-made to his skill in portraying heartless men who've sacrificed humanity to power. He's a slick, seductive role model for the young ambitious Wall Street broker played by Charlie Sheen, who falls into Gecko's sphere of influence and instantly succumbs to the allure of risky deals and generous payoffs. With such perks as a high-rise apartment and women who love men for their money, Charlie's like a worm on Gecko's hook, blind to the corporate maneuvering that puts him at odds with his own father (played by Sheen's offscreen father, Martin). With his usual lack of subtlety, writer-director Oliver Stone drew from the brokering experience of his own father to tell this Faustian tale for the \"me\" decade, but the movie's sledgehammer style is undeniably effective. A cautionary warning that Stone delivers on highly entertaining terms,Wall Streetgrabs your attention while questioning the corrupted values of a system that worships profit at the cost of one's soul.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792839846", "0800116917", "6301276930", "6302256615", "6300214540", "0800199421", "6302820448", "0792133153", "B00005OCPO", "B0002GTWOM", "B00003JRAB"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 166036}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.0, "brand": "", "asin": "6301016289", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51PRYBP6QZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Wall Street [VHS]"}

{"description": "This adaptation of the F. Scott Fitzgerald novel, scripted by Francis Ford Coppola, puts costume design and art direction above the intricacies of character. It's certainly a handsome try, and perhaps no movie could captureThe Great Gatsbyin its entirety. Robert Redford is an interesting casting choice as Gatsby, the millionaire isolated in his mansion, still dreaming of the woman he lost. And Sam Waterston is perfect as the narrator, Nick, who brings the dream girl Daisy Buchanan back to Gatsby. No, the problem seems to be that director Jack Clayton fell in love with the flapper dresses and the party scenes and the Jazz Age tunes, ending up with a Classics Illustrated version of a great book rather than a fresh, organic take on the text. While Redford grows more quietly intriguing in the film, Mia Farrow's pallid performance as Daisy leaves you wondering why Gatsby, or anyone else, should care so much about his grand passion. The effective supporting cast includes Bruce Dern as Daisy's husband, and Scott Wilson and Karen Black as the low-rent couple whose destinies cross the sun-drenched protagonists. (That's future star Patsy Kensit as Daisy's little daughter.) The film won two Oscars--not surprisingly, for costumes and musical score.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["0800125762", "6302816629", "6300182215", "6305718792", "6300215814", "B0001E7LQG", "6304925158", "6302415853", "6302281415", "6300216500", "6300262782", "6303052223", "0790744759", "0800124693", "0792839846", "6304039522", "0800106032", "6302936381", "6303823351", "630382336X", "0792110803"], "bought_together": ["0743273567"], "also_viewed": ["B00DHHWXYY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 232595}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 18.65, "brand": "", "asin": "6301247485", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51XW0FSNT7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Great Gatsby [VHS]"}
{"description": "Basil Rathbone comes to Transylvania to inherit his father's estate in this second sequel toFrankenstein. The townspeople are suspicious, but young Frankenstein has no interest in reviving his father's work--until he discovers the monster hidden away in the castle, inert but very much intact and watched over by Ygor (Bela Lugosi), a sinister, snaggle-toothed peasant with broken neck. Convinced to revive the creature and vindicate his father's name, he toils away in the lab not realizing that Ygor plans to use the monster to revenge himself on the jury that sentenced him to hang. Boris Karloff makes his final appearance as the Monster, now little more than a mute, lumbering robot under the hypnotic control of Ygor. Rathbone is a dignified, suave scientist and a marvelous match to Lugosi's mad Ygor, a richly malevolent performance that dominates the film. Lionel Atwill makes a marvelous addition to the Frankenstein gallery as the wooden-armed constable, a legacy of the monster's rampage 25&nbsp;years before (Mel Brooks's loving lampoonYoung Frankenstein, a veritable remake of this film, features the constable and his lumber limb in a major role). Universal abandoned horror films in 1936, but the success of this sequel single-handedly revived the genre. Though lacking the gothic splendor and macabre humor of James Whale's originals, Rowland&nbsp;V. Lee's handsome production remains an intelligent, well-made classic of the genre and Universal's last great horror film. Lugosi returns as Ygor inGhost of Frankenstein.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302526167", "6300181278", "6302841771", "630252542X", "6302843219", "6300183629", "6302841763", "6300185443", "6301005783", "6300183092", "630284178X", "6300181286", "6300183084", "6302843227", "6302526175", "B000G6BLWE", "6302526094", "B00005LC4L", "630018529X", "6302841844", "6302841798", "630252587X", "6302843197", "6300185281", "6300181820", "6303129188", "1564427099", "6302526191", "6303129161"], "bought_together": ["6302526167", "6300185443"], "also_viewed": ["B00005LC4L", "6302526167", "6302843200", "6301005783", "6302526175", "6302841879", "6303129013", "630312917X", "B0001CNRLQ", "630284178X"]}, "price": 22.0, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 362511}, "asin": "6301257014", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/511EV64Y71L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Son of Frankenstein [VHS]"}

{"description": "In this 1982 courtroom drama written by David Mamet and directed by Sidney Lumet, Paul Newman found the perfect role for a transitional period of his stellar career. As alcoholic Boston lawyer Frank Galvin, Newman shook off his screen persona as a handsome, blue-eyed hunk to portray an aging, weary man whose best years are behind him, with a shot-glass future that looks very bleak indeed. But when Galvin is given a chance to redeem himself--by proving medical negligence in the case of a comatose woman--he makes one final effort to regain his self-respect and tarnished reputation. He's an underdog against formidable odds, facing a powerful, politically connected lawyer (James Mason, slick as ever) who will do anything to win his case, regardless of professional ethics. Further complicating matters is a woman (Charlotte Rampling) who only appears to be worthy of Galvin's trust and love, until Galvin's best friend and colleague (Jack Warden) proves otherwise. Excellent as both courtroom drama and riveting character study, the film crackles with Mamet's sharp dialogue; and Lumet's direction is a brilliant example of forceful restraint. The film gave Newman one of the best roles of his career; many felt he deserved the Oscar (he lost to Ben Kingsley inGandhi) that would belatedly be given to Newman forThe Color of Money.

While camping out in Texas, the men see something they shouldn't--a  human sacrifice by Satanists who somehow manage not to notice their Safeway- sized vehicle until the last minute. The tourists flee from the devil  worshippers, getting the monstrous RV hung up in a stream, and so goes the  rest of the movie. The local sheriff is in league with the devil, and every  town they come to is full of pesky Satanists. The vacationers are nothing if  not resourceful, though; when a pair of determined Beelzebubbers cling to the  vehicle like barnacles, Peter Fonda pokes at them with an aluminum  vacuum-cleaner wand until they give up and fall off! Oddly, halfway through the  film, it turns from a fairly routine (if suspenseful) horror movie to a Ron  Howard-style car-chase film, with a half-dozen vehicles pursuing the motor  home. The vacationers continue to abuse the RV until large chunks of it begin  to fall off, fending off their enemies with a shotgun until the nasty  surprise ending. With a cast that includes Fonda, Warren Oates, Loretta Swit,  and Lara Parker, it's hard to go wrong (though the women's roles consist of  screaming ineffectually, making coffee, and cleaning the earth-toned  Winnebago).

{"description": "Sidney Lumet's directorial debut remains a tense, atmospheric (though slightly manipulative and stagy) courtroom thriller, in which the viewer never sees a trial and the only action is verbal. As he does in his later corruption commentaries such asSerpicoorQ & A, Lumet focuses on the lonely one-man battles of a protagonist whose ethics alienate him from the rest of jaded society. As the film opens, the seemingly open-and-shut trial of a young Puerto Rican accused of murdering his father with a knife has just concluded and the 12-man jury retires to their microscopic, sweltering quarters to decide the verdict. When the votes are counted, 11 men rule guilty, while one--played by Henry Fonda, again typecast as another liberal, truth-seeking hero--doubts the obvious. Stressing the idea of \"reasonable doubt,\" Fonda slowly chips away at the jury, who represent a microcosm of white, male society--exposing the prejudices and preconceptions that directly influence the other jurors' snap judgments. The tight script by Reginald Rose (based on his own teleplay) presents each juror vividly using detailed soliloquies, all which are expertly performed by the film's flawless cast.

The title, of course, refers not to Nicky the dick, but to the mysteriously missing scientist he and his lovely partner set out to find.

{"description": "If three people light cigarettes from the same match, one will die soon, or at least that's how the old superstition had it. Three childhood friends (Joan Blondell, Bette Davis, Ann Dvorak) laugh it off as they all light up from the same match. Vivian (Dvorak) is married to a wealthy attorney (played by Warren William, in a sympathetic role for once). Bored and stifled in her life, she decides on a walk on the wild side; absconding with their 4-year-old son, she falls in with gangsters and takes a nosedive. Soon she's living the life of a slattern, hooked on cocaine and bootleg liquor, neglecting her son like he's so much excess baggage. Meanwhile her husband and friends are frantic to get the little boy back and set things right again. In this movie's 64-minute running time, director Mervyn LeRoy managed to include Depression-era social commentary, drugs, crime, sex, violence, and some surprisingly well-fleshed-out characterizations. The young Bette Davis is beautiful (even playing one scene in her lingerie), and Blondell and Dvorak are both great in their roles. Even more remarkable, though, is the number of future stars that can be spotted inThree on a Match: Lyle Talbot, a young Anne Shirley, Edward Arnold, and Humphrey Bogart in a great role as a menacing hood.

{"description": "Australian model George Lazenby took up the mantle of the world's most suave secret agent when Sean Connery retired as James Bond--prematurely, it turned out. Connery returned inDiamonds Are Foreverbefore leaving the role to Roger Moore and Lazenby's subsequent career fizzled, yet this one-hit wonder is responsible for one of the best Bond films of all time.InOn Her Majesty's Secret Service, 007 leaves the Service to privately  pursue his SPECTRE nemesis Blofeld (played this time by Telly Savalas), whose latest master plan involves a threat to the world's crops by agricultural sterilization. Bond teams up with suave international crime lord Draco (Gabriele Ferzetti) and falls in love with--and marries--his elegant daughter, Tracy (Diana Rigg). Bond goes monogamous? Not at first; after all he has Blofeld's harem to seduce. Lazenby hasn't the intensity of Connery but he has fun with his quips and even lampoons the Bond image in a playful pre-credits sequence, and Rigg, fresh from playing sexy Emma Peel inThe Avengers, matches 007 in every way. Former editor Peter Hunt makes a strong directorial debut, deftly handling the elaborate action sequences--including a car chase turned road rally through the icy snow--with a kinetic finesse and a dash of humor. Though not a hit on its original release,On Her Majesty's Secret Servicehas become a fan  favorite and the closest the series has come to capturing the spirit of Ian Fleming's books.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["630238060X", "6302380294", "6302510023", "6302510015", "6302510007", "B0000068SI", "6302380588", "6302510031", "6303651488", "6303651461", "630251018X", "B000006FNX", "6304047843", "6305784906", "6302510198", "630251004X", "B00004TYS8", "B00008V2VP", "B000M53GMW", "B000RPCK1U", "6304032579", "B00004RWUH", "6304038801", "B000RPCK24", "B000RPCK1A", "B000M53GN6", "B000NDEXPM", "B000M53GMC", "B000M53GNG", "B000M53GLS", "B001PPLIEG", "B000NIBUS0", "B00AQSN7HE", "B000M53GM2", "B000RPCK0Q", "B000RPCK1K", "6302824613", "630150528X", "6304429274", "6302482712", "6303202004"], "bought_together": ["6302380294"], "also_viewed": ["6302380588", "6302510015", "B00004TYS8", "B00004W9C7"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 167907}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.44, "brand": "", "asin": "6302380596", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ZCDSK1KML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "On Her Majesty's Secret Service [VHS]"}

{"description": "Kathy Bates stars as an unhappy wife trying to get her husband's attention in this amusing and moving 1991 screen adaptation of Fannie Flagg's novelFried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe. After befriending a lonely old woman (Jessica Tandy), Bates hears the story of a lifelong friendship between two other women (Mary Stuary Masterson and Mary-Louise Parker, seen in flashback) who once ran a cafe in town against many personal odds. The tale inspires Bates to take further command over her life, and there director Jon Avnet (Up Close and Personal), in his first feature, has fun with the film. Bates develops a real attitude toward her thickheaded spouse at home and some uppity girls in a parking lot, but dignity is generally the key to Avnet's approach with the story's crucial relationships. Tandy is a joy and clearly loves the element of mystery attached to her character, and Masterson and Parker are excellent in the historical sequences.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301734734", "B00329TVQA", "630273973X", "6300247236", "6301398912", "B00000F5PI", "6300182304", "0800135954", "6300270971", "B00003CWL5", "6302800420", "B00004TJKK", "0790727382", "6300214222", "6304119046", "B0000DIXDR", "B0001E7LQG", "0800121600", "6304071876", "6302089654", "6300247031", "0790751089", "0792839846", "6303049079", "6300185095"], "bought_together": ["6301734734", "B00329TVQA"], "also_viewed": ["B00329TVQA", "6302526574", "6301734734", "630273973X"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 292992}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.76, "brand": "Universal", "asin": "6302468027", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51M0F20RPAL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Fried Green Tomatoes [VHS]"}

{"description": "The British superspy with a license to kill takes on his dark underworld double, a classy assassin who kills with golden bullets at $1 million a hit. Roger Moore, in his second outing as James Bond, meets Christopher Lee's Scaramanga, one of the most magnetic villains in the entire series, in this entertaining but rather wan entry in the 007 sweepstakes. Bond's globetrotting search takes him to Hong Kong, Bangkok, and finally China, where Scaramanga turns his island retreat into a twisted theme park for a deadly game of wits between the gunmen, moderated by Scaramanga's diminutive man Friday Nick Nack (Fantasy Island's Herv&eacute; Villechaize). Britt Ekland does her best as the most embarrassingly inept Bond girl in 007 history, a clumsy, dim agent named Mary Goodnight who looks fetching in a bikini, while Maud Adams is Scaramanga's tough but haunted lover and assistant (she returns to the series as the title character inOctopussy). Clifton James, the redneck sheriff fromLive and Let Die, makes an embarrassing and ill-advised appearance as a racist tourist who briefly teams up with 007 in what is otherwise the film's highlight, a high-energy chase through the crowded streets of Bangkok that climaxes with a breathtaking midair corkscrew jump. Bond and company are let down by a lazy script, but Moore balances the overplayed humor with a steely performance and Lee's charm and enthusiasm makes Scaramanga a cool, deadly, and thoroughly enchanting adversary.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302510023", "6302510031", "630251018X", "630251004X", "6302510007", "6302380596", "6304047843", "6302510198", "630238060X", "6302380294", "B0000068SI", "B00008V2VP", "6304032579", "6302380588", "B000006FNX", "B00004TYS8", "6303651461", "6303651488", "6305784906", "B00004RWUH", "6302824613", "6303212263", "630596260X"], "bought_together": ["6302510023", "6302510031"], "also_viewed": ["6302380588", "6302510031", "6302510007", "6302510023", "B00004TYS8", "6302380294", "6304047843", "630251018X", "630251004X", "6303651488", "630238060X", "6303651461", "6302380596", "6302510198", "B00008V2VP", "6304032579"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 170742}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.58, "brand": "", "asin": "6302510015", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510E8WWVDZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Man With the Golden Gun [VHS]"}

Jumping back in forth in time, the film chronicles the marital ups and downs of a stylish British couple (Albert Finney and Audrey Hepburn) as they travel on various vacations over the course of their 12-year marriage. The separate vignettes combine to form a collage of joys and pains as the young couple struggles to maintain their fading marital bliss. In this regard, the film is refreshingly sophisticated in its treatment of the difficulties of long-term commitment, and with Hepburn and Finney in the leads, great performances are drawn from the acerbic wit of Frederick Raphael's screenplay. Fashion mavens will also marvel at Hepburn's astonishing wardrobe of late-'60s fashion--she's a showcase for summer couture, looking fantastic in everything from candy-striped bellbottoms to hip sunglasses and outrageously stylish hats.

{"description": "Martin Scorsese does not sound like the logical choice to direct an adaptation of Edith Wharton's novel about manners and morals in New York society in the 1870s. But these are mean streets, too, and the psychological violence inflicted between characters is at least as damaging as the physical violence perpetrated by Scorsese's usual gangsters. At the center of the tale is Newland Archer (Daniel Day-Lewis), a somewhat diffident young man engaged to marry the very respectable May Welland (Winona Ryder). But Archer is distracted by May's cousin, the Countess Olenska (a radiant Michelle Pfeiffer), recently returned from Europe. As a married woman seeking a divorce, the countess is an embarrassment to all of New York society. But Archer is fascinated by her quick intelligence and worldly ways. Scorsese closely observes the tiny details of this world and this impossible situation; this is a movie in which the shift of someone's eyes can be as significant as the firing of a gun. The director's sense of color has never been keener, and his work with the actors is subtle.

Caroline (Judy Davis) and her husband, Lloyd (Kevin Spacey), have been at each other's throats for so long that they've developed domestic arguments into an art form, and the would-be kidnapper turns into a reluctant mediator, even after he's got the battling couple wound up in bungee cords. The situation grows even more complicated when the couple's smart-aleck son comes home from military school, but it's not the plot here that's a top priority.

{"description": "Richard Donner's 1978 epic about the Man of Steel showed how a film about a superhero could be a moving and romantic experience even for people who long ago gave up comic books. Beginning on the icy planet Krypton, the story follows the baby Kal-El, whose rocket ship lands in Smallville, Kansas. He is found there by a childless couple and raised as the shy Clark Kent (the young Kent is played by Jeff East). The film is perhaps most touching in these sequences, with expanses of wheat fields blowing in the wind and with a young man who can't figure out what part in destiny his great powers are meant to play. The second half, with Reeve taking over as Clark/Superman, is bustling, enchanting (the scene in which Superman flies girlfriend Lois Lane--played by Margot Kidder--through the night sky is great date material), and funny, thanks largely to Gene Hackman's sardonic portrayal of nemesis Lex Luthor.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300268993", "B000059XYC", "6300270122", "6303020089", "B000059XXZ", "0784011923", "B0002XNSYA", "B00005A1VG", "6303506291", "6301969413", "0800198395", "6302941318", "6304509154", "630196649X", "6304508611", "0790731975", "0790700506", "6300181537", "B000059XY5", "0790733897", "B00000JGEI", "6300214311", "6304047843", "6302238331", "6300214060", "630407185X", "6303148352", "6303212379", "6302510023", "0783216084", "B00004TYS8", "6302380294", "0790744589", "0792133153", "6302091632", "6302098424", "6304143184", "B0000068SI", "B00004RNAC", "6302510031", "630251018X", "6302510015", "B0000CDL3W", "6302510198", "B0001VL30O", "B000006FNX", "6302909023", "B000065U6Q", "6302032377"], "bought_together": ["6300268993", "B000059XYC"], "also_viewed": ["B000IJ79WU", "6300268993", "B000059Z8K", "B000P6XQ50", "B0039208JE", "6300270122", "B000IJ79VQ", "B000059XYC", "B000IJ79X4", "B001DJLD2G", "B000059XXZ", "B00F4FFO8E", "B00005JKCH", "6302642248", "6303953425", "B00005LIRF", "B00EAPMGIU", "B000IJ79XE", "B00BBND56G", "0790734079", "0784011923", "B000VI70QS", "B00005LKLF", "B000059Z8L", "B000UR9T8C", "B00005JXY3", "B0039208QM", "6303506291", "B0016MOWOQ", "B0087F7VSY", "B00000GUNY", "0783222726", "B00DYEN6XC", "B00E5I2MCM", "B0090SI582", "B00JPS6A3O", "B0057R5XRG", "B008JFUO72", "B008JFUS0U"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 202304}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.75, "brand": "", "asin": "6303212263", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51E39PXF9BL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Superman the Movie [VHS]"}
{"description": "Woody Allen combined the best parts of his earlier films in creating HANNAH AND HER SISTERS, his 1986 masterwork about the changing relationships among three sisters living in New York City. Hannah (Mia Farrow) has put her acting career aside in order to take care of her family with second husband Elliot (Michael Caine in an Oscar-winning performance). Elliot has fallen in love with Hannah's sister Lee (Barbara Hershey), who herself is feeling suffocated by her cynical, mean-spirited loner of a lover, played with great intensity by Ingmar Bergman regular Max von Sydow. Meanwhile, third sister Holly (Oscar winnner Dianne Wiest) is struggling to find her own voice, working as a caterer while she tries to get her own acting career going. And in the middle of everything is Mickey (Woody Allen at his most neurotic), a television writer who is divorced from Hannah, has dated Holly, and, when he suspects he might have a brain tumor, decides to re-evaluate his life and his faith in God. HANNAH AND HER SISTERS is Allen's most fully realized, optimistic adult comedy. He won a well-deserved Oscar for his marvelous screenplay, filled with his trademark sharp, witty dialogue, his undying passion for New York (its culture, architecture, music, romance), and some of his most well-developed characters. The cast is extraordinary, the music illuminating, the settings magnificent. Taking place over the course of a few Thanksgivings, Allen's insightful, wonderful film is a thoroughly enjoyable mature look at the trials, tribulations, and triumphs of family life.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005AUJL", "6301963911", "6301964365", "6304039166", "630146494X", "6300216365", "6301972147", "6301971922", "630228175X", "6302718910", "0800102371", "6303430546", "6303011411", "B0000068DV", "6302697042", "6300251012"]}, "price": 13.31, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 442883}, "asin": "6303232663", "imUrl": "http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-site/icons/no-img-sm._CB192198896_.gif", "title": "Hannah &amp; Her Sisters [VHS]"}

He is to be replaced by a new cleric on the South Seas island on which he works, arriving on a plane carrying three manacled convicts (Frank Sinatra, Gregoire Aslan, and Bernie Hamilton) on their way to prison on the main island of Tahiti. Tracy asks for permission to have the convicts help him finish the chapel at the island's hospital for children with leprosy, but, as they work, a series of earthquakes signal that the island's slumbering volcano might be waking. Finally, a huge quack erupts and the island's inhabitants prepare to evacuate, leaving Tracy, Sinatra, and company the responsibility of escorting the lepers to safety, a task that requires chaperoning them down the mountain, through the jungle, and out to the last evacuation boat before it departs at 4:00 sharp.

The audio tape he happened to be recording at that moment (adding to his collection of natural sounds), however, suggests but doesn't prove that a murderous conspiracy is afoot. Trying to tease a shred of evidence from murky doubt, Travolta's character turns to a hooker (Nancy Allen) for help and stumbles into a web of evil spun by a right-wing kook (John Lithgow).

When she learns of the presence of a high-class brothel in her neighborhood, she quietly goes to work there--but only during the day, until five o'clock in the afternoon. This sublime 1967 film is one of the latter-day masterpieces of the Spanish-born director Luis Bu&ntilde;uel, whose career forms one of the greatest and boldest arcs in cinema. By the time ofBelle de jour, Bu&ntilde;uel had become almost completely deadpan in his style, which not only leaves the motivation of S&eacute;verine a mystery (despite a few flashbacks to degradations of her youth), but also casts the entire plot in doubt. An old surrealist from the 1920s (when his first classic,Un chien andalou, was made in collaboration with Salvador Dali), Bu&ntilde;uel suggests that what we see may be real, or simply S&eacute;verine's imagination. Because he was the least pretentious of directors, Bu&ntilde;uel keeps his material playful, wicked, yet cutting. As S&eacute;verine, the impossibly lovely Catherine Deneuve uses her cool demeanor to great effect--she never breaks her deadpan, either. In 1995, after having been out of official circulation for years,Belle de Jourwas re-released in America and became an unexpected art-house hit.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301442768", "6305372594", "6300208591", "6301966015"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 355577}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6303855490", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41JX1GRW6RL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Belle De Jour [VHS]"}

The flirtation blossoms after Evie introduces tomboyish Randy to the joys of Whitman and opera. Randy returns the favor by acquainting the sheltered Evie with the problems and delights of mature, taboo love. There is a beautiful scene where the two consummate their courtship on Evie's birthday while Mom is out of town. The true test of their relationship occurs during the hilarious climax when angry families and friends chase the troubled girls into hiding.--Margaret Griffis", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 507799}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.12, "brand": "", "asin": "6303909000", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51FM9K9WZJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Incredibly True Adventures of Two Girls in Love [VHS]"}

However, the film was rarely shown with the proper 3-D projection, going out \"flat\" instead (a 1980 reissue restored the process for a limited theatrical release).Dial Mwas remade in 1998 asA Perfect Murder, a film that changed and expanded the material, with no improvement on the clean, witty original.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300183513", "0783236352", "0783221347", "1558807780", "6300215741", "0783235593", "0790743213", "0783235607", "6302413435", "6300183580", "6301798503", "6301670159", "6301670140", "6304039506", "6305123616", "6304359705", "6301975987", "6301586026", "6300215644", "6301800974", "6301976061", "630266232X", "6301977769", "B000021Y6K", "B00001OWYM", "6304119046", "6304119097", "6300181340", "6305012792", "6300215512", "B00004TRD5", "6301607929", "B000003KE0", "B0002IXSVI", "6301942639", "B00000I1EM", "0792839846", "6303364772", "B000GX7MMA", "6301647734", "0782006779", "6301971558", "0800113055", "6304111363", "6302360978", "0792107683", "6300214060", "0782008348", "6300215814", "6301977815", "6302797535", "6301973259", "B00000F13T", "B000PYKZYC", "0792110269", "0790733935", "B00000F3QZ", "B00000I1DI", "6301969316", "6304359721", "6302226899", "6300183890", "630150528X", "6302278929", "6301978110", "6300268594", "630522269X", "0800100832", "630236325X", "B00005RRG6"], "bought_together": ["0783236352"], "also_viewed": ["B002945DUM", "0790733935", "6301964012", "6300183513", "0783221347", "0790743213", "0783235593"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 178485}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 13.75, "brand": "", "asin": "6304039530", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51G9QYKZ8RL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Dial M for Murder [VHS]"}

But when Dean asks to be paid, he's blatantly turned down by the \"nothing is ever good enough for me\" Joanna.So when Joanna falls overboard and gets a bad case of amnesia, Dean takes advantage of the situation and, in a stroke of retributive genius, tells her that she's his wife and the mother of hisfour unruly children!", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301796535", "B00000FZZW", "B00007E2F6", "6302676711", "6301966988", "0790772256", "6302579449", "0800196767", "0792837207", "6304474652", "6300214370", "078880782X", "6302765536", "6304039174"], "bought_together": ["6302676711"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 286331}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.74, "brand": "", "asin": "6304286511", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51AQC4MMFCL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Overboard [VHS]"}
{"description": "A very impressive treatment of the rise and fall of New York crime boss John Gotti, this made-for-TV movie succeeds in large measure because of the outstanding work of Armand Assante (I, The Jury,Mambo Kings) as Gotti. Assante creates a complex portrayal of a man loyal to the mob while struggling with personal demons and his own self-destructive ambitions. The film traces the dapper don's rise through the ranks of the Gambino crime family, first through the patronage of his mentor (Anthony Quinn) and then through a brazen assassination of the Gambino boss. Eventually Gotti's world crashes around him as his arrogance over beating the government at trial and his thirst for the limelight causes a rift with his right-hand man, Sammy \"The Bull\" Gravano (William Forsythe).Gottiboasts terrific New York City locales and a truly impressive cast, including standout work by Forsythe and Quinn. But it's Assante's movie all the way, and he makes the most out of a larger than life character by making him seem no more, and no less, than human and flawed.--Robert Lane", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302610702"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 427578}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.85, "brand": "", "asin": "6304285116", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51SQYMVXJQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Gotti [VHS]"}
{"description": "When it comes to ramping up to vein-bursting levels of tormented anxiety, Mel Gibson has a kind of mainstream intensity that makes him perfect for his heroic-father role in director Ron Howard's child-kidnapping thriller.  When you think ofRansom, you automatically think of the scene in which Mel reaches his boiling point and yells, &quot;Give me back my son!&quot; to the kidnapper on the other end of several torturous phone calls. Trapped in the middle of any parent's nightmare, Mel plays a self-made airline mogul whose son (played by Brawley Nolte, son of actor Nick Nolte) is abducted by a close-knit group of uptight kidnappers. But when a king's ransom is demanded for the child's safe return, Mel turns the tables and offers the ransom as reward money for anyone who provides information leading to the kidnappers' arrest. Thus begins a nerve-racking battle of wills and a test of the father's conviction to carry out a plan that could cost his son's life. The boy's mother (played by Rene Russo, reunited with Gibson afterLethal Weapon 3) disapproves of her husband's life-threatening gamble, and a seasoned FBI negotiator (Delroy Lindo) is equally fearful of disaster as the search for the kidnappers intensifies. Through it all, Howard maintains a level of nail-biting tension to match Gibson's desperate ploy, and the plot twists are just clever enough to cancel out the overwrought performances and manipulative screenplay.Ransommay not be as sophisticated as its glossy production design would suggest, but it's a thriller with above-average intelligence and an emotion-driven plot that couldn't be more urgent. Adding to the intensity is a superior supporting cast including Gary Sinise, Lili Taylor, and Liev Schreiber as the kidnappers, who demonstrate that even the tightest scheme can unravel under unexpected stress. Remade from a 1956 film starring Glenn Ford,Ransomis diluted by a few too many subplots, but as a high-stakes game of cat and mouse, it's a slick and satisfying example of Hollywood entertainment.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300214222", "0783235607", "B0002IXSVI"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 434293}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.48, "brand": "", "asin": "6304414145", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/512DRJY7J1L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Ransom [VHS]"}

{"description": "Nothing that British filmmaker Michael Winterbottom made beforeWelcome to Sarajevo(includingButterfly KissandJude) suggested the clarifying rage of this 1997 film, which is based on the experiences of British journalist Michael Nicholson while on assignment in Bosnia. Made emotionally numb by the savagery and insanity of Serbian aggression on Sarajevo and surrounding towns and countryside, reporter Michael Henderson (Stephen Dillane in a remarkable performance) awakens to the plight of one orphanage and particularly to that of a girl whom he promises to rescue. Henderson's efforts lead to a harrowing bus journey to (temporary) protection for some of the kids (others, quite shockingly, are carried off en route by Serb marauders), and then a second, even more dangerous good deed to finish what he started. The film's dimensions go well beyond that story line, however, as Winterbottom re-creates the gallows-humor culture of international correspondents in a blighted region, as well as the nightmare of the Sarajevo siege. Most savage of all, however, is the director's use of news clips in a pointed attack on the West's refusal to deal with the slaughter and outrages in Bosnia at their peak. The supporting cast might look like a bunch of famous names (Kerry Fox, Marisa Tomei) used decorously to attract attention to the film, but in fact everyone is very good, especially Woody Harrelson as an American journalist whose entrance in the story is one of the most memorable in recent history.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_viewed": ["1572523026", "6304520182", "1573629065"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 438482}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 10.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6304938225", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51S46F5ACML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Welcome to Sarajevo [VHS]"}

{"description": "The curiosity of Quentin Tarantino'sJackie Brownis Robert Forster's worldly wise bail bondsman Max Cherry, the most alive character in this adaptation of Elmore Leonard'sRum Punch. The Academy Awards saw it the same way, giving Forster the film's only nomination. The film is more \"rum\" than \"punch\" and will certainly disappoint those who are looking for Tarantino's trademark style. This movie is a slow, decaffeinated story of six characters glued to a half million dollars brought illegally into the country. The money belongs to Ordell (Samuel&nbsp;L. Jackson), a gunrunner just bright enough to control his universe and do his own dirty work. His just-paroled friend--a loose term with Ordell--Louis (Robert De Niro) is just taking up space and could be interested in the money. However, his loyalties are in question between his old partner and Ordell's doped-up girl (Bridget Fonda). Certainly Fed Ray Nicolette (Michael Keaton) wants to arrest Ordell with the illegal money. The key is the title character, a late-40s-ish flight attendant (Pam Grier) who can pull her own weight and soon has both sides believing she's working for them. The end result is rarely in doubt, and what is left is two hours of Tarantino's expert dialogue as he moves his characters around town.Tarantino changed the race of Jackie and Ordell, a move that means little except that it allows Tarantino to heap on black culture and language, something he has a gift and passion for. He said this film is for an older audience although the language and drug use may put them off. The film is not a salute to Grier's blaxploitation films beyond the musical score. Unexpectedly the most fascinating scenes are between Grier and Forster: two neo-stars glowing in the limelight of their first major Hollywood film after decades of work.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000X81ZI", "6303953425", "B00006G8O1", "B000286RJI", "6304106017", "B000067DGJ", "6305095566", "B0000633ZP", "6302968100", "6302816580", "B000056V73", "630504077X", "630300394X"], "bought_together": ["B0000X81ZI"], "also_viewed": ["B009B0OG1O", "630268644X", "6300183211"]}, "price": 9.85, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 236793}, "asin": "6305006598", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71GXP626B7L._SY300_.gif", "title": "Jackie Brown [VHS]"}
{"description": "For director Robert Redford the trick was directing himself. The Oscar-winning director (Ordinary People,Quiz Show) says that he is one kind of actor (in the moment) and a different kind of director (more controlling). Whatever the problems, Redford has worked it out beautifully in this leisurely paced adaptation of Nicholas Evans's bestseller. When the prized horse ofNew Yorkmagazine editor's (Kristen Scott Thomas) daughter suffers a horrible accident, she tracks down Tom Booker (Redford), a Montana horse healer who is known for working magic. Soon East Coast brashness meets Old West simplicity as the reluctant Annie takes her even more reluctant daughter (Scarlett Johansson) to Marlboro country. Booker's influence goes beyond the horse through healing the heart of daughter and mother. The 2-hour and 44-minute film is a beautiful travelogue of scene and sky (with a giant assist from Oliver Stone's usual cinematographer, Robert Richardson). Never complicated, the movie's rewards may be hidden in its length and Redford's tendency to introduce us to a way of life instead of focusing on a story. The major deviation from the end of Evans's novel is a welcomed change.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["0790748193", "B0000DCGT1", "6305132666", "0767809262", "0792151712", "0767825616", "B000006N70", "6303153321", "6300214567", "6301586042", "B00004RGUU", "6302415853", "6305123616", "6304457324", "6302581907", "6302800420", "6300185095", "6302254132", "B00005NQGQ", "B00005PJ8I", "6300267970"], "bought_together": ["B0000DCGT1"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 113274}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.45, "brand": "", "asin": "6305126062", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41FQG9AC2GL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Horse Whisperer [VHS]"}
{"description": "The definitive American television series of the '90s comes to the big screen with an anticlimactic whimper. And how could it be otherwise? Why should material so perfectly realized in one medium necessarily translate well into another? The series is crisply and thoughtfully executed in just about every detail, but the heart of its appeal lies in the elegant handling of complicated and evolving ongoing story lines, which is not something movies are especially good at. The big-screen drive for closure cramps the creative style, though it may also help nonfans get a grip on the proceedings. We do get some invigorating thrills and chills, however, and a more satisfying sense of the scale of an all-enveloping human-alien conspiracy than ever before, but there's no more plot development here than in an average two-part season-ending. FBI black sheep Mulder and Scully have been temporarily transferred from the X-Files project to an anti-terrorist unit to investigate an Oklahoma City-style bombing. They uncover a new wrinkle in the Syndicate/Cancer Man conspiracy--basically an attempt to help one bunch of (benign?) aliens fight off another bunch who want to colonize Earth. A spectacular, ice-bound finale thrillingly staged by series-veteran director Rob Bowman offers Mulder (but not a conveniently unconscious Scully) his first clear look at a You Know What, which in some quarters qualifies as an epochal event. Martin Landau offers the agents some crucial clues, and several familiar TV faces (including the Lone Gunmen and Mitch Pileggi's indispensable Assistant Director Skinner) turn up briefly to wink knowingly at faithful fans.--David Chute", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B001FACH7S", "B001G7PSZI", "B000UZDO5I", "6303402348", "080010367X"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 338484}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.95, "brand": "20th Century Fox", "asin": "6305142467", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41GEJ8WNSKL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The X-Files (Movie) [VHS]"}
{"description": "Peter Weir directed this comedy-drama, a commentary on all-pervasive media manipulation. Scripted by Andrew M. Niccol (Gattaca), the film plays like a combination of the British TV series The Prisoner and Paul Bartel's The Secret Cinema. Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey) is unaware that his entire life is a hugely popular 24-hour-a-day TV series. In this real-time documentary, every moment of Truman's existence is captured by concealed cameras and telecast to a giant global audience. His friends and family are actors who smile pleasantly at Truman's familiar catchphrase greeting, \"In case I don't see you later, good afternoon, good evening, and good night!\" Employed at an insurance company, Truman is married to merry Meryl (Laura Linney), and they live in the cheerful community of Seahaven, an island \"paradise\" where the weather is always mild and no unpleasantness intrudes. This is the basic situation of the series, which has grown over the years into a billion-dollar franchise for the TV network. As an unwanted pregnancy, Truman was adopted by the network and raised in the zoolike environment of a TV soundstage. Thus, the TV audience became hooked when Truman was very young. Now, at age 30, he still doesn't know he's a prisoner on an immense domed city-size soundstage, simulating Seahaven. Both the illusion and the ratings will collapse if Truman ever leaves Seahaven. In addition to elaborate events staged to make sure he stays put, Truman is given constant reminders of how wonderful Seahaven is compared to dangers in other parts of the world. However, his growing suspicions make him curious enough to try to leave, and the show's director and master manipulator Christof (Ed Harris) must constantly devise ways to thwart Truman's escape attempts. To enter the harbor, Truman must overcome his fear of water, intentionally instilled in him when his father \"died\" in a boating accident and was written out of the script.", "related": {"also_bought": ["0790731649"], "bought_together": ["0790731649"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 319413}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.0, "brand": "", "asin": "630518299X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GRFF4KA1L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Truman Show [VHS]"}
{"description": "Robert Bolt's successful play was not considered a hot commercial property by Columbia Pictures--a period piece about a moral issue without a star, without even a love story. Perhaps that's why Columbia left director Fred Zinnemann alone to makeA Man for All Seasons, as long as he stuck to a relatively small budget. The results took everyone by surprise, as the talky morality play became a box-office hit and collected the top Oscars for 1966. At the play's heart is the standoff between King Henry VIII (Robert Shaw, in young lion form) and Sir Thomas More (Paul Scofield, in an Oscar-winning performance). Henry wants More's official approval of divorce, but More's strict ethical and religious code will not let him waffle. More's rectitude is a source of exasperation to Cardinal Wolsey (Orson Welles in a cameo), who chides, \"If you could just see facts flat on without that horrible moral squint.\" Zinnemann's approach is all simplicity, and indeed the somewhat prosaic staging doesn't create a great deal of cinematic excitement. But the language is worth savoring, and the ethical politics are debated with all the calm and majesty of an absorbing chess game.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000056HEA", "B0057FGCRI", "B0000B1A58", "B001D5F2LI", "B0006GANX2", "B00008J2PG", "B00005AUKE", "B000BITV92", "B0006HBV3W", "B000BYA4HE", "B00AEFY6DI", "B00008LDO7", "076781326X", "B000XJD34I", "B00012FXJ0", "B00004TVUD", "0780021312", "0385496931", "B0018LX9RG", "B004FQX5A2", "B003WEAW04", "B002QXOYQK", "0679728228", "B00003CXBH", "B000FFJ83K", "B001NSLE5I", "B0000549B1", "B00005JKF6", "B000KX0IOA", "B000255LIY", "B00006ADD5", "B00005AUKB", "B000KJTGHO", "B00003CXBU", "B001GLX6TY", "B00004XPPC", "B00AEBB9FA", "B000WMFZMY", "B00005JN8Z", "B00011D1OK", "0898706254", "B00125WAXM", "B0001US8F8", "B0000633QW", "B00006RCO2", "6304907729", "B001D8W7EU", "B00GHU35HM", "B000E1MXTG", "B00AMSM9CW", "0767827775", "B00096S412", "B001GUYAZY", "B0051WTN50", "B00005MEOU", "6305257450", "B002HK9IDQ", "B000E1MXT6", "B000FL7C9G", "B0009S4IKQ", "B000MTEGSG", "B0045HCJQM", "B002VWNIBI", "B000E1ZBFY", "B00011D1OU", "B000LXWAI6", "B00005V1WY", "B00D3K357O", "B006FE83UE", "B0045HCJJY", "B0006GANY6", "B0002BO05S", "B00006RCO3", "B00GA8Z0B0", "B0010AN7Z4", "B00F6SHECS", "B001MVYUQ6", "0783240171", "B00BYCOIU6", "B000KGGJ0Y", "B004XYOQU4"], "bought_together": ["B000056HEA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000056HEA", "0679728228", "B0057FGCRI", "B000255LIY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 125062}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 19.37, "brand": "", "asin": "6305252564", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51-2r8McJlL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "A Man for All Seasons"}
{"description": "Christmas is not a good time of year in the McClane family. Especially  for John McClane, who always happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. But if it weren't for the heroics of this rugged, resourceful cop, many lives would be lost and megalomaniacal terrorists with various European accents would be having their evil way. In 1988, director John McTiernan and the phenomenal hitDie Hardintroduced the world to maverick Sgt. John McClane (Bruce Willis) of the New York Police Department, and in the course of this film and two blockbuster sequels McClane was frantically saving lives, buildings, airports, schools, cities, and even his marriage from the threat of international terrorists, psychopaths, and cagey mercenaries. Now you can watch antihero McClane blast his way through all three movies. Witness his transition from a happy-go-lucky, slightly cranky cop to extremely burnt-out, partially alcoholic cop with a propensity to attract extreme violence and catastrophe. Yet the one thing that always overshadows his character flaws is his uncanny ability to spoil the schemes of stylish villains with slick names such as Hans Gruber (the nasty terrorist from the first film, played to perfection by Alan Rickman). Sit down, pop some corn, grab a bottle of Coca-Cola, and get ready to watch (in any order you please) theDie Hard Trilogy--a must for any action buff or fan of Bruce Willis, who owes his film career to the enduring appeal of these global box-office hits.--Jeremy Storey", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000VNMMR0", "B000U1ZV8K", "B00BUAEYVK", "B002GSXKNS", "B0004Z33G4", "B000MGBLSC", "B000MGBSE4", "B001VLBDD0", "B000XT1P4S", "B00005N5S5", "B0015XHP4A", "6304711891", "6304806434", "B005COLETU", "0790729695", "B00000G3PA", "B00388PK7O", "B000MGBLTQ", "B000JYW5BE", "B00004STDN", "B0006GANOQ", "B001TK80C0", "B00003CXC5", "B004EPYZUS", "B000U1ZV62", "B001DJLD1M", "B000U1ZV4Y", "B009MF5BXK", "B005CFBYW6", "B0057RCFQS", "B0054OGQM8", "B005PTYP70", "B00000ILDH", "B00004Z4WR", "B00005JA8B", "B002ZG999U", "B00070FX5U", "B0018CMJSU", "B00008G8M4", "B00JU949TK", "B008E70EES", "B0045HCJFS", "B0004Z33EG", "B00AKGG828", "B008JFURII", "B001B3LIOC", "B002GSXKP6", "B00026ZG10", "B003Q6D2B4", "B000BPL2FQ", "B009HIKAN8", "B000TGJ8CQ", "B000QUCRB4", "B0004Z33F0", "B000059H9A", "B000RJO56E", "B000HT38BM", "B000P0J06K", "B006VRRGNK", "6304712987", "0790738953", "B00016MSV2", "0767803434", "0790736411", "B003AWRMCE", "B00562I40K", "0783226888", "B00005R2IS", "B00023B1LC", "B002Z7FWBI", "B000FO0AA6", "B001E75QH0", "0767807588", "B00015YVDG", "B001TODCII", "B005LAIGLE", "0800195175", "B00005ATZT", "B00BEJL6JK", "B001AJIHC8", "B00005JKIP", "B00BLF9FOK", "B004SIP9Z6", "B004GJYRK0", "B00029NMRM", "B000VWYJ86", "B007X4ECMI", "B000F9RB9Y", "B000P0J0EM", "B0009X76XC", "B00AEFYUQQ", "B001ZGKOG8", "B000NA1WGS", "B007SPPANM", "B00AEFXKUI", "0790731924", "6305767866", "B00007AJG4", "B003ASLJNQ", "B004AZ7ZKY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000YGDNPO", "B00BUAEYVK", "B000O78KW4", "B000U1ZV8K"]}, "price": 30.25, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 225698}, "asin": "6305286566", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Y1Q1JSPHL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Die Hard Trilogy"}
{"description": "A high-profile action/exploitation thriller set in the present,The Siegeis really a fantasy that extrapolates from major terrorist attacks. Denzel Washington is FBI special agent Hubbard, \"Hub\" to his friends, whose anti-terrorist task force must track down the terrorist cells responsible for a spate of bombings in New York.  His partner is an FBI agent of Arabian extraction (played convincingly by Tony Shalhoub), proving not all Arabs are bad guys--a point the film should be lauded for making again and again. Thrown into the mix is a CIA spy (played almost kittenish at times by Annette Bening), whose ties to the terrorists appear to be at the center of the conflicts.  When the bombings escalate out of control, the President institutes martial law, sending in General Devereaux (played with impenetrable countenance by Bruce Willis) with tanks and troops to ferret out the terrorists. Echoes of Japanese-Americans in internment camps ring out as Arabs, including the son of the Arab-American FBI agent, are herded into a stadium.  Periodic audio-montages of \"man in the street\" sentiments anchor the material in the present and show how serious and relevant the material is.

{"description": "Radley Metzger's erotic Mediterranean romp, adapted from an off-Broadway play, is a five-character drama of mind games and sex games. A swinging married couple with an ongoing rivalry sets their sights on a naive young couple who have moved into their darling little Mediterranean town (the village of Leisure, in the land of Play, deep within the Erogenous Zone, according to the narrator, though in reality shot in Zagreb, Yugoslavia). The newlyweds are having troubles of their own, making them easy marks for the hedonistic swingers, but Metzger flips the tale from craven exploitation to sexual healing. As the beautiful young couple succumbs to seduction (and not necessarily the couplings you would expect), their inhibitions are unlocked and their guilt overcome with pleasure. Neither exploitative nor judgmental, Metzger's elegant soft-core erotica combines a playful cinematic style with a cool European sensibility, set against a handsome landscape of old-world architecture and chic modern settings. This exploration of bisexual seduction is his most explicit offering (sans his brief sojourn into the adult film industry), yet for  all of its nudity, which is surprisingly balanced between male and female scenes, it remains a smart, witty, sweet little erotic fairy tale in which even selfish intentions lead to happy endings.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004GBMVTW", "B004D8P23K", "B003B2UK1S", "B003XKNGNW", "B00177Y9TS", "B001AZKB8K", "B00003JRAV", "B003ODKZTQ", "B006ZPUIII", "B003BMBRHY", "B0015FHDWM", "B0031DRZEC", "B005GWKUC0", "B00B022GVS", "B00023P4I8", "B00I4CWIVU", "B0009WDVUK", "B0002ZDWVM", "B00IA7MFEO", "B0012Z368K", "B00AZAJXOE", "B0076ANKUY", "B00JVQ7QTM", "B00AY6PK5A", "B00INUK5WM", "B003MSY968", "B0004Z32NI", "B00HRJVHOU", "B006M3M5FM", "B00GPPXNIK", "B000F0UUD2", "B0007W6HVM", "B004SKJYJG", "B000BGH29K", "B00005O0SY", "B00GRZPRB4", "B000CFX7DK", "B00122775G", "B000CCD1ZM", "B005DU58QS", "B0009VRHLK", "B00FB349R6", "B0053TRRNG", "B006HLBCDA", "B00AKLLSNC", "B002R3CQDC", "B006Z7Z3VS", "B0012IV3S2", "B000TXPXAU", "B00A7WHL08", "B00JDOQMH4", "B000B9E2M2", "B000SKU04S", "B00C8CQ5SO", "B00BLQBQYQ", "B0007TZHWA", "B000HEWEXA", "B000FZEQCS", "B004YMATCY", "B001C5LLVE", "B0010SAGHS", "B00FKPJ3VM", "B00I5VVVPO", "B004FHCH4G", "B00007L4I8", "B00ARWWTKK", "B00005OCJN", "B000RJEI84", "B004RJQ9X2", "B00006LPGC", "B00AYGVCCK", "B000069HZO", "B00919TING", "B001Q8FSPM", "B000HEWEWG", "B00DDXEJE4", "B00170ICZM", "B000LAZDQA", "B007XF0XSE", "B008HT2X5G", "B000NVKWYU", "B000OCZ9WS", "B008XSDU5S", "B00AFDN5Y0", "B00BJSLNN0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000063K1Q", "B004D8P23K", "B00AKLLSNC", "B004GBMVTW"]}, "price": 31.48, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 104271}, "asin": "6305340528", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/519BSYZE6SL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "SCORE"}

Despite a cool reaction from critics, the film was such a hit with the Soviet public that many Russian babies born in '24 were named Aelita, and the Cubist designs of the Martian sets--heavily influenced by the avant-garde \"constructivist\" style--would in turn influence science fiction films in the years to follow (most notably theFlash Gordonserials). With costume designs performances that are truly out of this world,Aelitawas the 1924 equivalent of a Spielberg spectacular; now it's a museum piece, unlikely to raise anyone's pulse, but it's startling to think that this film was even possible in 1924 Russia.The story is almost beside the point, revolving around a married Moscow engineer who dreams of Aelita, the Queen of Mars, and is obsessed with building a spaceship that will take him to her. An alleged murder, passionate jealousy, and a bumbling detective are all part of the film's portrait of hardscrabble post-revolutionary lifestyle, but they pale in comparison to the intermittent scenes on Mars, which peak with the engineer's ultimate arrival and the eruption of a Martian slave rebellion! It's pure propaganda, but agreeably light and remarkably revealing of its time and place. Anyone expecting a SovietMetropoliswill be disappointed, but if you're fascinated by imaginative films from the silent era,Aelitais must-see viewing.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00064AEXI", "B005MTAST2", "B0058OTM4S", "6305131104", "B00CP5VXWW", "B0040QYROA", "B000V7HFL4", "B001P3XYUE", "B0063E00HU", "B00D9BNONW", "B00006JMQG", "B00A44GNTE", "B000I8OOG0", "B00004S89X", "B00000ILF9", "B0053TWW6S", "6305301697", "B000AJJNA4", "B0013XZ6Y8", "B000056N7V", "B0006GAONG", "B004NTXH68", "B00004Z4TL", "B00007L4MH", "B001UHKPHU", "B000TUDHJ2", "B00006IUII", "B007UQ8ISI", "B0001US600", "B00478ED6S", "B00009XN8Y", "B0010WMV8Q", "B000H5U5IK", "B0018W2L0G", "B00006LPE4", "B004B9XRZ6", "B0001FVDT6", "B000HC2LOY", "B0002NRS46", "0500514143", "B001M9ELJE", "B005QAGC06", "B0000633T0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00064AEXI", "B0058OTM4S", "B0000E69HD", "B00005O5CA"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 258087}, "asin": "6305470286", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41V-wJ2brXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Aelita: Queen of Mars (1924)"}

{"description": "It's, like, Shakespeare, man! This good-natured and likeable update ofThe Taming of the Shrewtakes the basics of Shakespeare's farce about a surly wench and the man who tries to win her and transfers it to modern-day Padua High School. Kat Stratford (Julia Stiles) is a sullen, forbidding riot grrrl who has a blistering word for everyone; her sunny younger sister Bianca (Larisa Oleynik) is poised for high school stardom. The problem: overprotective and paranoid Papa Stratford (a dryly funny Larry Miller) won't let Bianca date until boy-hating Kat does, which is to say never. When Bianca's pining suitor Cameron (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) gets wind of this, he hires the mysterious, brooding Patrick Verona (Heath Ledger) to loosen Kat up. Of course, what starts out as a paying gig turns to true love as Patrick discovers that underneath her brittle exterior, Kat is a regular babe. The script, by Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith, is sitcom-funny with peppy one-liners and lots of smart teenspeak; however, its cleverness and imagination doesn't really extend beyond its characters' Renaissance names and occasional snippets of real Shakespearean dialogue. What makes the movie energetic and winning is the formula that helped makeShe's All Thatsuch a big hit: two high-wattage stars who look great and can really act. Ledger is a hunk of promise with a quick grin and charming Aussie accent, and Stiles mines Kat's bitterness and anger to depths usually unknown in teen films; her recitation of her English class sonnet (from which the film takes its title) is funny, heartbreaking, and hopelessly romantic. The imperious Allison Janney (Primary Colors) nearly steals the film as a no-nonsense guidance counselor secretly writing a trashy romance novel.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303853102", "6302998611", "6302787068", "6301796535", "B00006RCST", "630018403X", "6300183467", "6302091632", "0800109481", "6300214753", "6302968100", "6300263673", "6304978286"], "also_viewed": ["B005HY1P94"]}, "price": 10.53, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 177740}, "asin": "6305537798", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/712HBPMSPEL._SY300_.gif", "title": "10 Things I Hate About You [VHS]"}

{"description": "OK, let's get all the disclaimers out of the way first. Despite its colorful (if crude) animation,South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncutis in no way meant for kids. It is chock full of profanity that might even make Quentin Tarantino blanch and has blasphemous references to God, Satan, Saddam Hussein (who's sleeping with Satan, literally), and Canada. It's rife with scatological humor, suggestive sexual situations, political incorrectness, and gleeful, rampant vulgarity. And it's probably one of the most brilliant satires ever made. The plot: flatulent Canadian grossmeistersTerrance and Philip hit the big screen, and the South Park quartet of third graders--Stan, Kyle, Kenny, and Cartman--begin repeating their profane one-liners ad infinitum. The parents of South Park, led by Kyle's overbearing mom, form \"Mothers Against Canada,\" blaming their neighbors to the north for their children's corruption and taking Terrance and Philip as war prisoners. It's up to the kids then to rescue their heroes from execution, not mention a brooding Satan, who's planning to take over the world.To give away any more of the plot would destroy the fun, but this feature-length version of Trey Parker and Matt Stone's Comedy Central hit is a dead-on and hilarious send-up of pop culture. And did we mention it's amusical? From the opening production number \"Mountain Town\" to the cheerful antiprofanity sing-along \"It's Easy, MMMKay\" to Satan's faux-Disney ballad \"Up There,\" Parker (who wrote or cowrote all the songs) brilliantly shoots down every earnest musical fromBeauty and the BeasttoLes Mis&eacute;rables. And in advocating free speech and satirizing well-meaning but misguided parental censorship groups (with a special nod to the MPAA),Bigger, Longer & Uncuthits home against adult paranoia and hypocrisy with a vengeance. And the jokes, while indeed vulgar and gross, are hysterical; we can't repeat them here, especially the lyrics to Terrance and Philip's hit song, but you'll be rolling on the floor. Don't worry, though--to paraphrase Cartman, this movie won't warp your fragile little mind.

{"description": "Sean Connery plays a master thief thought to be long retired, while Catherine Zeta-Jones is his foil, a hotshot insurance investigator assigned to his case. They both have a little something to hold over each other's heads, until it turns out that Zeta-Jones is a professional art thief herself and is playing on both sides of the fence. At first they eye each other with mutual distrust until they team up for a job, which goes off without a hitch. Inevitably their prickly relationship begins to thaw somewhat, and the two become attracted to each other as they plan out the massive Y2K bank scam that is the movie's climax (complete with sequel-ready ending).Entrapmentplays somewhat like a '70s caper movie revamped for the gadget-happy high-tech '90s. The plot takes a few too many labored twists and turns, and the chemistry between the two leads is nearly nonexistent, though both carry on gamely in their parts. On the other hand, there is some genuine suspense in many scenes as they go about their business, dripping with whiz-bang burglary devices. Zeta-Jones, of course, is drop-dead gorgeous, and Connery is as reliable as always in his role. The fairly flat editing and direction tends to drag the film down somewhat, but fans of caper movies, high-tech thrillers, and the two leads should find plenty to like in this film.--Jerry Renshaw", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00006IUNT", "6304925131", "079212569X", "0792133153", "0792116887", "B0000048TX", "6303696813", "0790731975", "6303313345", "6304258984", "0783223218", "0800125762", "B00004WIDB", "B00000IO4G", "0783216084", "6303020089", "0790748169", "6300183211"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 212089}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6305622825", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/7179VDAPNGL._SY300_.gif", "title": "Entrapment [VHS]"}

{"description": "Having discreetly disbanded at the dawn of the MTV era, the 1970s' most stubbornly faceless pop subversives returned after 19&nbsp;years with their first new studio album, followed in short order by this stunning long-form video project. Part concert, part documentary,Steely Dan: Two Against Natureoffers a savvy cross-section of both old and new material performed by the latest incarnation of the formidable stage bands that founders Walter Becker and Donald Fagen have assembled for the periodic tours unleashed since their early '90s concert reunion. True to form, they preside over immaculately arranged, flawlessly executed performances that confirm the Dan's state-of-the-art standards, then undercut that achievement with devilish audience sound bites and their own faux cable-access interviews, as if to debunk their artistry with a blast of anticelebrity.For hardcore Dan fans (including this reviewer), Becker and  Fagen long ago distanced themselves from rock culture, their music steeped more in '50s jazz and rhythm & blues, and their lyrics pitched to a darker, funnier world-view divorced from youth culture and self-congratulatory rock personae. Fagen, with his close-cropped hair, austere beard, tinted glasses, and prominent incisors resembles a pale, vampiric Ray Charles as he huddles over his keyboards and croons those dangerous lyrics. His partner's longer locks and steel-rimmed glasses reinforce the spectre of a postbop Franz Schubert who's traded clavichords for custom electric guitars--a studious image reinforced by his dry, articulate gibes in the interviews, if undercut by the twisted imagery and shadowy, second-person perspectives pervasive in the band's lyrics (like the music, written by both men, but conspicuously shaped by Becker).The material hews to the  group's later albums recorded after they downsized the band into a de facto studio laboratory and dialed up the jazz accents, with understandable showcases for the sneaky new songs on theTwo Against Naturealbum: sleek, seductive songs about incest, midlife crises, pyromania, designer drugs, and other fun stuff. Sonically, the performances are as meticulously recorded and mixed as the duo's albums, with the performance footage beautifully shot and edited. We'd knock director Earle Sebastian for a few too many tilted camera angles, but then we might have to wait another  19&nbsp;years for the next one.--Sam Sutherland", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000I5XD06", "B00HUQC442", "B00KGFGJGS", "B00HUQC3U2", "B00004YX39", "B008O9V4C2", "B00005QBZD", "B000002MIY", "B0000936MD", "B000ZOSMTW", "B0038QGXMC", "B0050JN8BE", "B000002L42", "B0002IQI2Y", "B000E5N62U", "B00003002D", "B00000IPAB", "630463949X", "B00003002C", "B008B3MZMY", "B00HUGK78M", "B000002KXV", "B00JPUUPLA", "B00000DI0I", "B00KF1CWF0", "B00023P4B0", "B00002ND7R", "B00000IPAC", "B00000DI0J", "B005MXQD0G", "B000G73U5Y", "B00JQPOYAC", "B0001WANWW", "B0003035CW", "B00092ZMDY", "B003PBYT62", "0670025518", "B000053VAB", "B0016KJS3I", "B000BF0DCE", "B00005U122", "B007XNAPJS", "B0094P2SA2", "B00B7IJCZS", "B00CG0YLGG", "B00008PX8P", "B002CGS00C", "B0007Y89ZM", "B000654YRY", "B0018AK9NO", "B00023B1A8", "B0050JN7Z6", "B000069HQ8", "B0018LMZOO", "B0053TWUXI", "B0007GADZE", "B005ORVN1Y", "B0006A9GSG", "B004EKP5TS", "B00B7IJC9O", "B00FFLBXJQ", "B006T8KT6M", "B005V4X8TK", "B0001MDQ44", "B0018M6J72", "B00FLDG5BE", "B007FZ7NEE", "B0000D0YT4", "B00CA4S2PO", "B001XJEKGC", "B00J4A27B2", "6305019681", "B000P7V45S", "B000051Y2R", "B000N3SOSY", "B000BTC5LW", "B0043E8Y48", "B000002L2L", "B004GF244K", "B001DWNUF6", "B001NP8PQM", "B000A2RRF4", "B00EL6NWG8", "B00065MDSG", "B0018CWWLE", "B000056MMD", "B009E3EY38", "B000002OHR", "B001NP8PRG", "B00000J7S8", "B005JS7VTQ", "B0027WNRK4", "1573300934", "B004FRVE18", "B00B5DWH0W", "B00001ODGR", "B00EWV68SG", "B000AYQJ3I", "B00EL6NWT0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00HUQC3U2", "B000I5XD06", "B000ZOSMTW", "B0038QGXMC"]}, "price": 8.91, "categories": [["CDs & Vinyl", "Classic Rock", "Album-Oriented Rock (AOR)"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Jazz", "Vocal Jazz"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Pop", "Soft Rock"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Pop", "Vocal Pop"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Rock"], ["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 73385}, "asin": "6305846464", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/517T8W49QPL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Steely Dan - Two Against Nature - DTS 5.1"}

{"description": "This affecting, bittersweet tale--adapted from Brian Friel's semi-autobiographical Tony Award-winningplay--examines the emotional lives of the five unmarried Mundy sisters in 1936 rural Ireland. In their mutual care is 8-year-old Michael (sweetly understated Darrell Johnston), the illegitimate son of youngest sister Christina (Braveheart's Catherine McCormack). A voice-over from the adult Michael recalls that significant summer, in the month of August, during the feast of Lughnasa. The bolder townfolk dance around a fire to Lugh, an ancient god of light. Yes, this is fiercely Roman Catholic Ireland and Lugh a pagan god, but that irony is at the core of the film, the hypocrisy of tradition. The dramatic change in the richly metaphoric movie comes with the arrival of two men: eldest sibling--and only Mundy brother--Jack (Michael Gambon), a priest returning from many years in Africa, now addled, and Christine's long-absent lover and Michael's father, the charmingly flighty Gerry (Rhys Ifans). Beautiful music and excellent performances highlight the film, which also features gorgeous cinematography of the Irish countryside. Meryl Streep is stern eldest sister Kate; Kathy Burke is lively Maggie; Brid Brennan (who appeared in the stage play) is thoughtful caretaker Agnes; and Sophie Thompson is simple sweet Rose. It's a quiet film, but one filled with ironic and haunting meaning. Directed by Pat O'Connor (Circle of Friends).--N.F.

{"description": "Hidden throughoutCach&#xE9;is the sense that you should be watching every moment in this film closely, just as the protagonists are themselves being watched by someone unknown. Georges and Anne Laurent&#x92;s (Daniel Auteuil and Juliette Binoche) enviable lives are terrorized by the sudden arrival on their doorstep of a videotaped recording of their Parisian townhouse. It&#x92;s nothing but a long, unedited shot of the fa&#xE7;ade of their house, but it&#x92;s disturbing nonetheless. Soon another arrives, this time of the farmhouse Georges grew up in, and then another of a car driving down a suburban street, and a walk down a hallway to a low-rent apartment. Again the videos are benign but unsettling. Then the mystery becomes more threatening when they receive gruesome postcards depicting child-like drawings of bloody, dead stick figures. Georges believes he knows who the culprit is, but for reasons all his own  refuses to let his wife in on the secret. Clearly more is hidden here than just the identity of their stalker. InCach&#xE9;, writer and director Michael Haneke skillfully, methodically pulls back multiple layers of deception, like new skin being pulled off an old wound. he masterfully fuses elements of his predecessors to create a film that is haunting and memorable. There is Bergman's fascination with the complexity of relationships, the suspense and lurking danger of Hitchcock, and the unique cinematic sensibility of Antonioni. In fact, the provocative final shot is practically a tribute toThe Passenger--a lot of people will want to rewatch it many times to see what they can find in it (if, after watching it, you are still unsatisfied with the resolution, then watch the interview with Haneke in the DVD's special features for his insights). It's a film of great effect and intrigue. There are no easy resolutions, and the answers given in this mystery will only lead to more questions.--Daniel Vancini", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002BWP4A6", "B00006LPER", "B000SIWHAK", "B00386OWUC", "B00187FPC2", "B00062134E", "B000068MAL", "6305228876", "B0002DB52M", "B00AIBZLHS", "B002BWP3UC", "B000OVLBGC", "B000B9EYFW", "B002AG2NTI", "B0057GYODG", "B00005N89H", "B0036TGSJE", "B000G0O5IM", "B000MTEFP0", "B00092ZLEY", "B0012QE4PI", "B0019UGYAU", "B00005N8A9", "B00023P4N8", "B0007Z0NYQ", "B0001EFUFK", "B000EHQU3A", "B002VKB0M4", "B00151QYE4", "B00005JKJA", "B000N4SHOO", "B00HVOFP6W", "B00AIBZLR8", "B005KQVE1S", "B00K0MM4AM", "B004WPYO7E", "B00HE011DE", "B006KH6CF4", "B000N3T0DW", "B00008976W", "B0007OCG5G", "B000059HA5", "B000083C5F", "B00GPPXNQ2", "B00018D40O", "B002VECLXC", "B00AX7PGQS", "B003VA3JTA", "B00005QAPJ", "B00005OSLQ", "B003Y5H4R0", "B00HT2RTU6", "6305744114", "B00005K9O8", "B00429MM1K", "B002P7UCJK", "080215056X", "B000E5LEV0", "B00009W0U4", "B000EHQU30", "B000BRBA8S", "B00JJ3EHCG", "B00IGK6TH4", "B00005JLQW", "B0007GAG42", "B00000K3TS", "B00K72HVBC", "B00005NFZC", "B000HIVIQU", "B000N6TX1I", "B000OCY7JE", "B007A9EGG8", "B001CIOCLC", "B00AEBB89W", "B000N2HBIO", "B00CQ8HCSM", "B000EQ5V2C", "B000E6EGT6", "B000934FC2", "B0087IT8FK", "B002BWP3UM", "B0006Z2NCM", "B00GRA7M2G", "B00ATK015K", "6305999872", "B001AZJKKK", "B000GBEWNY", "B000GBEWPC", "B00F6SHGF8", "B00008976Y", "B000FVQM2Y", "B00H4IR3JC", "B004ODLUIU", "B0006IUE9I", "B004YCKKH8", "B00455JE58", "B002ZG4Q66", "B0081HLM2E", "B00AEFXN9G", "B0024FAG2Q"], "bought_together": ["B002BWP4A6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002BWP4A6", "B00187FPC2", "B0036TGSJE", "B00006LPER"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 17815}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.28, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B00000F7E6", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41CS99VVAKL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Cache (Hidden)"}

{"description": "Although its publicity toutsThree Seasons, a triple winner at the 1999 Sundance Film Festival, as \"the only American film made entirely in Vietnam,, there is little that is American about this movie. Its sensibility seems far more Vietnamese than American, from its lyrical Oriental imagery and its concern with the plight of Vietnamese citizens since the war to its reverence for the country's ancient culture. Similarly, Harvey Keitel is listed as the star, but his is really the most minor of the film's major roles.Three Seasonstells three tangentially linked stories. First is the tale of Kien An (Ngoc Hiep Nguyen), a lovely young woman who works picking lotus blossoms at a sanitarium. She becomes a scribe for its mysterious proprietor, Teacher Dao (Manh Cuong Tran), a leper who hides himself away in shame but whose soul is full of beautiful poetry. Then there is Hai (Don Duong), a gentle \"cyclo\" (bicycle ricksha) driver who falls in love with Lan (Zoe Bui), an alluring, feisty prostitute he sees coming and going from the big tourist hotels. Last, there is James Hager (Keitel), an ex-Marine who fought in the war and has returned to find the daughter he fathered many years before. There is also a charming plot about Woody (Huu Duoc Nguyen), a little street urchin who sells contraband out of a suitcase. The narrative involving Keitel's character is the least developed in the film, and seems to be almost an afterthought, but in any event, truly magnificent visuals and a delicate lyricism makeThree Seasonsa haunting, bittersweet film portrait of life in contemporary Vietnam.--Laura Mirsky", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000U788WU"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 364171}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 10.75, "brand": "", "asin": "B00000JSJU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51CDGYPGY3L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Three Seasons [VHS]"}

{"description": "In 1996, composer, producer, and guitar legend Ry Cooder entered Egrem Studios in Havana with the forgotten greats of Cuban music, many of them in their 60s and 70s, some of them long since retired. The resulting album,Buena Vista Social Club, became a Grammy-winning international bestseller. When Cooder returned to Havana in 1998 to record a solo album by 72-year-old vocalist Ibrahim Ferrer, filmmaker Wim Wenders was on hand to document the occasion. Wenders splits the film between portraits of the performers, who tell their stories directly to the camera as they wander the streets and neighborhoods of Havana, and a celebration of the music heard in performance scenes in the studio, in their first concert in Amsterdam, and in their second and final concert at Carnegie Hall. The songs are too often cut short in this fashion, butBuena Vista Social Clubis not a concert film. Wenders weaves the artist biographies with a glimpse of modern Cuba remembering its past, capturing a lost culture in music that is suddenly, unexpectedly revived for audiences in Havana and around the world. Wenders makes his presence practically invisible, as if his directorial flourishes or off-screen narration might deflect attention from the artists, who do a fine job of telling their own stories through interviews and music. It's a loving portrait of a master class in Cuban music, with a vital cast of aging performers whose energy and passion belie their years.--Sean Axmaker", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 455404}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 0.21, "brand": "", "asin": "B0000203Y5", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41GCEV8VXXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Buena Vista Social Club [VHS]"}
{"description": "With a voracious trio of mako sharks wreaking havoc,Deep Blue  Seadares to up the ante onJaws, but director Renny Harlin trades the nuanced suspense of Spielberg's 1975 blockbuster for the trickery of the digital age. In other words, why build genuine terror when you can show ill-fated humans getting torn into bloody chunks? The aforementioned makos have been lab rats in an effort to harvest a miracle cure for Alzheimer's disease from the brains of sharks, but the research has an unfortunate side effect: the sharks get smarter, and they're determined to break out of Aquatica, the deep-sea complex where they've been penned.Model-actress Saffron Burrows plays the researcher; Thomas Jane pulls double-duty as shark expert and action hunk; Samuel&nbsp;L. Jackson's the corporate sponsor who chooses theworsttime for an Aquatica tour; and rapper LL&nbsp;Cool&nbsp;J is nicely cast as Aquatica's cook and comic  relief. Michael Rapaport, Jacqueline McKenzie, and Stellan Skarsg&aring;rd round out the cast, most of whom are turned into shark food as the makos turn Aquatica into a floating junkyard. Harlin takes devilish pleasure in providing sudden, unexpected shocks--no small feat in such a derivative thriller--and  as a series of action set-pieces,Deep Blue Seanever disappoints. It's inevitable that Burrows should end up in her underwear like Sigourney Weaver inAlien, but even then the movie offers a credible reason for the strip-down; thatDeep Blue Seacan be simultaneously ridiculous and sensible is just another one of its shlocky charms.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B008DL4LQ2", "0767802497", "B00008WFU5", "B0006HBZYC", "B00008WFU4", "B00005A8XX", "6305090564", "B004USUP58", "B003VA3JUO", "B000WTVZGC", "B002NZK5U0", "B00AEFYXQI", "6305943133", "B007STBUHI", "B003ZZ7TPG", "0783225547", "B001YYQ9S8", "B00153ZR8G", "B00AIZ2FPK", "B00005O5B5", "B00064X5L6", "B00064AE0G", "B00AEFYSR2", "B000JBXHQY", "B0002V7OI8", "B00E8G5HQE", "B005CHV14A", "B004FHCHAU", "B00018D3UU", "B00DCLTA6Y", "B000BNX3BE", "B003ABZG14", "B003954IV0", "B00BTYNXJG", "B000NVT0TI", "0767817478", "B000N4RAS8", "B000ASATZ8", "B00000IQC4", "B001DSNEK6", "B00000IQVQ", "B00000G3PA", "B004K4FUVQ", "B00008G8M4", "B002O3Z50G", "0783237413", "B00004STDN", "B004XVMCN0", "B002ZG98LO", "0792839684", "B00005UQ9W", "B000PFU83O", "B0010X73ZG", "B00013RC7K", "B00AEFXPMG", "B004LWZW6K", "B00005JOWW", "B00003L9CQ", "B004AC6PV2", "B0002W4SBI", "B000WTVZGW", "B003UN0752", "B0002IQMAM", "B00005JM5B", "B00BNAE14W", "B00AEFXPSK", "B004P7CN7W", "B000X0GWNG", "B00005RYKU", "B00004Z4WR", "0767824954", "B000BUNZY2", "B00008G8LY", "B00317LM8S", "B00111YM56", "B00003CXKA", "B00600SOXE", "B00005JMXX", "B00AEFY6PQ", "B00005JMZK", "6304806434", "B0045HCJ0S", "B00BTYOYG2", "B000AM4P9K", "B004W7D1G2", "B00AEFYV9W", "B002ZG98KK", "B0001FR3IQ", "B00009WVSL", "B0057RCFQS", "B004EPZ08O", "B00003CXO1", "B000CSUNLG", "B003PIUINS", "B001ECDVKE", "B00111YM5Q", "B00IS6WQ5K", "B0021L8UXA", "B00003CXUP"], "bought_together": ["B00008WFU5", "B00008WFU4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0767802497", "B00008WFU4", "B008DL4LQ2", "B00004TDTO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 122500}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.55, "brand": "JACKSON,SAMUEL L.", "asin": "B00002E233", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71TDBGEC1NL._SY300_.gif", "title": "Deep Blue Sea"}

{"description": "This is where is the Lynchian nightmare began. Though he may have redefined surrealistic cinema in the 1980s and forever altered the face of television in the 90s, for many hardcore fans it is this infamous feature film debut that is David Lynch's crowning achievement. Many words have been used to describeEraserhead(weird, bizarre, frustrating, enlightening, significant, unwatchable, meaningless, and momentous), but there is no denying it is completely unforgettable. As a surreal work of art,Eraserheadeasily holds it own next to the works as Bu&ntilde;uel, Cocteau, and Dali. And like many surrealistic works, there is no clear answer on whatEraserhead\"means.\" But, if you are trying to find a simple, linear, plot inEraserhead, you are clearly missing the point. ForEraserheadis not simply a movie to view, but a true cinematic experience, like jumping into someone's nightmare and seeing it from their perspective.  Whether you see it as a meditation on the terror of being a new parent, the suffocating feeling of living in an increasingly vapid, industrial wasteland, or a nightmare about the fear of loneliness, the film easily holds up to multiple viewings. And since this film is a dark visual ride and a supreme aural achievement, this long awaited, new transfer is an absolute blessing for David Lynch fans who will finally get to see, hear and experienceEraserheadclearly on DVD.  Bizarre experiment? Surrealistic nightmare? Or a meaningless cult film?

For international animation andanimefans,Princess Mononokerepresents an auspicious next step for its revered creator, Hayao Miyazaki (My Neighbor Totoro,Kiki's Delivery Service), an acknowledgedanimepioneer, whose painterly style, vivid character design, and stylized approach to storytelling take ambitious, evolutionary steps here.Set in medieval Japan, Miyazaki's original story envisions a struggle between nature and man. The march of technology, embodied in the dark iron forges of the ambitious Tatara clan, threatens the natural forces explicit in the benevolent Great God of the Forest and the wide-eyed, spectral spirits he protects. When Ashitaka, a young warrior from a remote, and endangered, village clan, kills a ravenous, boar-like monster, he discovers the beast is in fact an infectious \"demon god,\" transformed by human anger. Ashitaka's quest to solve the beast's fatal curse brings him into the midst of human political intrigues as well as the more crucial battle between man and nature.Miyazaki's convoluted fable is clearly not the stuff of kiddie matinees, nor is the often graphic violence depicted during the battles that ensue. If some younger viewers (or less attentive older ones) will wish for a diagram to sort out the players, Miyazaki's atmospheric world and its lush visual design are reasons enough to watch. For the English-language version, Miramax assembled an impressive vocal cast including Gillian Anderson, Billy Crudup (as Ashitaka), Claire Danes (as San), Minnie Driver (as Lady Eboshi), Billy Bob Thornton, and Jada Pinkett Smith. They bring added nuance to a very different kind of magic kingdom. Recommended for ages 12 and older.--Sam Sutherland", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JLEU", "B000CDGVOE", "B0001XAPZ6", "B002ZTQV8Y", "B002ZTQVHK", "B002ZTQVLG", "B004CRR9G0", "B002ZTQVGQ", "B006LLY8LY", "B0001XAPY2", "B0006J28BO", "B005LAIGX2", "B00CSYR432", "B000CDGVOO", "B004CRR9EW", "B0009MAO3W", "B00BEYYEJ4", "B00BEYYEIK", "B00ENNO1E6", "B00CSYRHG6", "B007JNTOBC", "B008XEZXRA", "B002ZTQVBQ", "B00ENNBZ68", "B007JNTPSO", "B00ENNUC9Y", "6304493681", "B005LAIGXM", "B00CJ7Y0US", "B00B1RB942", "B00441GYS8", "B00ENNA62W", "B00102FF7U", "B008XEZXYI", "B0009MAO3M", "B00AUJH32E", "B0023S49YU", "B000VWYJ68", "B003NF97M6", "B0030ZOYHC", "B009AVC922", "B000TGCR3I", "B001XUTVLK", "B0009P42S2", "B00D44IQQE", "B001DXPWO2", "B005OK0YUC", "B007DBM40S", "B00EJYAWS8", "B004GZZH6W", "0061478784", "B0001EFTVA", "B004R0MF0M", "B004EC5IUW", "B0049TC8AI", "B00CJ7Y19I", "B001CZJP0S", "B002NUULNG", "B0049TC8C6", "B000CEV3O6", "078886145X", "B000A2LV4W", "B009AVCAJ4", "B007V9ECV6", "B004DMIISM", "B008YRL7JE", "1421550644", "1421561042", "B008D1RCKY", "B00B1RB9AQ", "B00AQ7DWCK", "B000VWYJ5Y", "B00B6DTFOC", "B00G5SBI1Q", "B009RZ890M", "B000058A7J", "B00CU6WC94", "B004DMIIPA", "B0043988G2", "B000YAA68W", "B005W2BWEO", "B008D1RDIU", "B002Y0KR66", "B008NNY9YE", "B008XEZXXE", "B00BQ1DDUG", "B00CU6WBOU", "B002KPIO4C", "B00BLQRFQY", "B00GS1GWRU", "B000B8I9XQ", "B00576U9JE", "B00CU6WC8K", "B007DCE5UO", "B000F6ZIFQ", "B000IZGBW8", "B0035RWG0M"], "bought_together": ["B00005JLEU", "B000CDGVOE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002ZTQV8Y", "B00005JLEU", "B00ENNO1E6", "B002ZTQVGQ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 937}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 13.99, "brand": "Buena Vista", "asin": "B00003CXBK", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51KXTH5HPHL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Princess Mononoke"}
{"description": "Many Hollywood directors should follow Rod Lurie's lead and invite their stars to do the DVD commentary. Oscar nominee Joan Allan joins Lurie, turning the commentary track into an enjoyable conversation. It tends to be a lovefest at times but does give insight into the relationship between a lead actor and director during filmmaking. Over the end credits, Lurie mentions the brouhaha that actor (and producer) Gary Oldman started when he made discouraging comments about the film's final cut. It's interesting to note none of Oldman's work ends up in the dozen deleted scenes shown on the DVD. The scenes have much more meat on the bone than most and illustrate some curious character development. The half-hour making-of featurette has the standard press-kit materials but also gives us a good background on the history of political thrillers.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783227973", "B0060ZJ7DA", "0780622561", "B001ECDVK4", "B0043X1FNQ", "B000CEXEWA", "B004IFYMWK", "B00AEFYTMQ", "B00003CWRX", "6304696507", "B00AEFYUQQ", "6305297142", "B003ASLJIQ", "B00005JNP4", "B0001V6ZJI", "B001ECDVJU", "B0059XTTW8", "0783116934", "B0013XZ2QK", "B000067IZ3", "B00005BCK9", "B00000K3TU", "0792159659", "B00005UM2X", "B000C65Z1G", "B00441GYTC", "6305428522", "B00003CXQG", "630542828X", "B002NZK5UU", "6305310335", "B00000IQC0", "B002EAYE42", "B00005OOQ2", "B002ZG993Q", "B004SIP6C2", "B005FITIGO", "B0043X1FKY", "B00004RF83", "0767802519", "B00006ZXSN", "0783229402", "B006ML50QK", "B00003CXPV", "0800141806", "B00DW5IK9S", "B000BYRCQU", "B00006L92U", "B000CQLZ8S", "B00008K76V", "B00AEBB8LA", "B000Y11B8U", "0767803434", "B007KAUWO2", "6304696515", "B003Y5H4R0", "B0000542C5", "B0011V7PSC", "B00GUO2SKA", "B00G7QQ3AC", "0790730979", "B00AEFXUXU", "B001PR0Y8K", "B00000K3CS", "B00015YVDG", "1558908382", "B00AEFXYJA", "B00008K76U", "B002DU39GW", "0792845811", "B004SIP7F8", "B000056HEA", "B0039UT3LK", "B0007IO6NM", "B00JA3RVG4", "B00G7QPXUI", "B00004XPPB", "B00005BCKF", "0764585533", "B00GMV8M2Y", "B0000SXK0E", "B000063US3", "B004FQX59I", "B00008K7AO", "B00AEFYIH2", "B00003CXFV", "B001GLX6UI", "B00006RCNY", "B0045HCJJ4", "B00BTYRB58", "6305428115", "B001AMHNKW", "B0012EBV6A", "0767811100", "B0060ZJ7AI", "B0009GX1CE", "B000HT38IK", "B00004ZBVO", "B00005ATZT"], "bought_together": ["0783227973", "0780622561"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0064470393", "0783227973"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 40208}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 13.99, "brand": "", "asin": "B00003CXP7", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/411PCH1X0RL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Contender"}

{"description": "In the first season ofThe X-Files, creator Chris Carter was uncertain of the series' future, so each of the episodes is a self-contained suspense story; they do not delve deep into the ongoing X-Files mythology or turn to self-parody and humor as do episodes in later seasons. Yet, these episodes display the elements for which the show would become famous: the cinematic production values and top-notch special effects, the stark lighting of the Vancouver sets, the atmospheric halo of Mark Snow's score, and the clever plots dealing with subjects ranging from the occult, religion, and monsters to urban legends, conspiracy theories, and science fiction. Most importantly, season&nbsp;1 introduces FBI agents Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and Fox \"Spooky\" Mulder (David Duchovny), two of the most attractive government officials around. Scully is the serious-minded medical scientist assigned to join Mulder on the X-Files, a division of the FBI dealing with the paranormal. Mulder is the intuitive thinker with a dry wit, a passionate believer in the existence of paranormal phenomena and one of the few characters on television smart enough to figure out who the bad guy is before the audience does. Their muddled relationship, a deep friendship laced with sexual tension, provides the human heart in a world where the bizarre and horrible lurk in everyday society.The materials on the bonus disc provide some interesting trivia and background, but it is the 24 episodes themselves that make this seven-disc boxed set a true find. Those unfamiliar withThe X-Filesoften view all the fuss with the same skepticism with which Scully first regards her new partner's ideas. But just as she comes to realize the uncanny accuracy of Mulder's outlandish theories, newcomers toThe X-Fileswho sample a few episodes in this boxed set will likely find themselves riveted to their television late into the night. And undoubtedly, the shadows and creaking noises in the house that evening will seem more menacing than usual.--Eugene Wei", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000BOH98G", "B000BOH990", "B000CNE0SS", "B000CNE0T2", "B000CNE0TC", "B000EXDS34", "B000EXDS3E", "B000EXDS3Y", "B0007X7044", "B001G7PSZI", "B001FACH7S", "B0006UEVUE", "B001CY5N00", "B00005JA9M", "B0007ZEO7I", "B000002N3A", "B00CRVL5ZE", "B002GP7ZVY", "B00FXW9664", "B002GP7ZVO", "B000083C6V", "B00003CXIS", "B001G7PSSK", "B003V1IU3O", "B000ATQYWY", "B004X60QE2", "B000244E2O", "B0030E5PYO", "B002GP7ZV4", "B000NDEXK2", "B002ZCY872", "0792839056", "B0012CJQYG", "B0002I848K", "B000EBGFPY", "B000UX6THK", "B001C4CI8U", "B00BTYNXJG", "B00005JNOG", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B006BZ8NSE", "B00GTZWZH6", "B00465I156", "B000R7GKQE", "B0002PYS7Y", "B000F8O2Q0", "B000F8O2PQ", "B00466H3CW", "B0009X76XW", "B001T21R5U", "B00005Y1NF", "B000AQ68Z0", "B001BSBBGC", "B000063V8R", "B000BGR1B4", "B007C8RZQ0", "B002BWP2IK", "B0058JEHTS", "B002GP7ZW8", "B000667HBS", "B00DNUSFZQ", "B00CDAG0WW", "B00AEBB9AK", "B000FOPPBA", "B000056T4I", "B001FB4W0C", "B001KOFH2G", "B002JVWRAO", "B0009NZ2RE", "B004QOB8TS", "B000AJJNI6", "B0002ERWVE", "B00BM2JVAA", "0790742012", "B000VDDDY6", "B000F8O2OW", "B00HR2HTRQ", "B004YM6JI2", "B00005JNEQ", "B00003CXZ4", "B000FJH5M2", "B001MVWRNE", "0783225725", "B000EXDS7K", "B00019074O", "B000JLTRHW", "B003BNO9GO", "B001G0MFIS", "B0032JTV6A", "B000FIMG68", "B004LROMWU", "B00008972G", "B001DMVZJ4", "B0011UF79M", "B005FISBTO", "B001715A92", "B000P6YNSE", "B00009PY45", "B00BYNL8DU", "B008B4KVRE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00CRVL5ZE", "B000BOH990", "B000BOH98G", "B0007X7044"]}, "price": 1.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 170142}, "asin": "B00003RQND", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51G8JY0Q71L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The X-Files - The Complete First Season"}
{"description": "Frank Sinatra stars with Kim Novak and Eleanor Parker in this riveting drama about a poker dealer/jazz musician who descends to skid row after becoming addicted to heroin. Will he make it back into the spotlight&#x97;or even survive? Based upon the classic American novel by Nelson Algren, The Man with the Golden Arm was far ahead of its time with its depiction of what drugs can do to even an ambitious person. Its cautionary tale still holds up today as heroin has come back to haunt not only the inner city but middle America as well. It contains what Frank Sinatra himself considered his best performance, a role which gained him an Oscar nomination for Best Actor of 1955. Directed by the notorious Otto Preminger, this hard-edged, expressionistic view of the normally-depicted-as-glorious 1950s will come as a fascinating surprise to those who have yet to discover this classic melodrama. Co-starring a young Darren McGavin in his debut film performance, it also contains one of movie score legend Elmer Bernstein&#x92;s best compositions which earned one of the film&#x92;s two other Oscar nominations, along with one for art direction. Includes Original Theatrical Trailer: Approx. 2 min. Film: Approx. 119 min.Bonus Material:  At The Movies With Frank Sinatra Enjoy exclusive and revealing interviews with Hollywood legends Henry Silva (Manchurian Candidate), Beverly Garland (The Joker Is Wild), Ernest Borgnine (From Here To Eternity), and Joey Bishop (Ocean&#x92;s 11). Along with these rare and insightful interviews from the stars are the original coming attraction trailers from these classic moments of cinema magic. Special bonus material includes a revealing backstage look at the making of The Man With The Golden Arm. Sinatra himself is seen in a rare and candid interview. Composer Elmer Bernstein talks about scoring the film, and discusses Sinatra&#x92;s artistic contributions. Star Tommy Sands relates classic moments of what it was like working with Sinatra, and historian Rick Ross talks about the impact of Frank&#x92;s performance in this classic contribution to the annals of Hollywood Cinema.

The \"True Patriots\" featurette is much better, examining the painstaking efforts toward authenticity in production design, artillery, and costuming. The visual effects featurette offers a study of several pivotal shots, displayed in triptych fashion (to show how effects are layered together from separate elements) and narrated by visual effects supervisor Stuart Robertson. Generous photo galleries are included, featuring shots of the primary cast, sets, and costumes (the last matched by a gallery of conceptual drawings), and the feature-length commentary by director Roland Emmerich and producer Dean Devlin is worthwhile, if not altogether essential.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEFXKUI", "B00AMSLDTM", "B00AEBBA36", "B00AEFY5B6", "B00001ZWUS", "0800177967", "B000A2WP7O", "B00008G8M4", "B00003CXTG", "B004AOECXI", "B002O3Z510", "B000065U1N", "B00005221M", "B00000G3PA", "B00AEFY0F2", "B000E5N6LG", "B002O3Z50Q", "B0001HLVS2", "079284646X", "B00003CXA6", "B008MIMWOY", "6304711905", "0783225733", "B002VWNID6", "B0002WZTOI", "B000P0J0EW", "B00009OOFA", "B000NOKFHQ", "0783231202", "B000P0J0EM", "B003U0AHBO", "B004SIP7TE", "B00003CXQA", "B0000TANUI", "0792839137", "B00011CZRE", "B00005B6JZ", "B0002DRDBY", "B00AEFXRRO", "B002AS464Q", "B000WGWQG8", "B00026L9CU", "B00005JN5E", "B00007GZYC", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00005ATZT", "B000067D1R", "B000U1ZV8K", "B00B0U2SFE", "B003AWRMCE", "6304806434", "B00AEBB932", "B00005JM6F", "B00005JL3T", "B002ZG997C", "B00AEFXVCU", "B000FI8MPW", "B000VKL6ZM", "B00319ECI8", "B005LAIGYQ", "B0045HCJT4", "B0008JIJ2O", "B002O3Z50G", "B00AZNEW5G", "B00008AOTO", "B000LP6KNU", "0783227973", "B002VWNIBI", "B004FQX5B6", "B00AEBB9WI", "B004IK30M8", "B004IK30MI", "B0007PALM0", "B00AEBBA0E", "B001TK80D4", "B000O77SRC", "B004SIP7ZS", "B000095WW8", "079283366X", "6305558167", "B00AEFXKOO", "B0007TKNM4", "B0002YLCG0", "B00003CXHJ", "B000MZHW40", "B000F48D4G", "B001BNFRB2", "B00AEFXYJA", "B000QXDED6", "0767817710", "B0004Z33EG", "B00005JN0W", "B003ASLJRC", "B00HEPE6MM", "0790729695", "B000FVQLRA", "B00004WG2F", "B008MIMWQW", "B000GG4Y32", "B0068FZ0O2"], "bought_together": ["B00001ZWUS", "B00AEBBA36"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00001ZWUS", "B00AEFY5B6", "B004AOECXI", "B000NOKFHQ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 2823}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.0, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B00004XPPG", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51NDFXHAW9L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Patriot (Special Edition)"}

Charles Laughton portrays scowling Captain Bligh, a seafaring monster who rules with the law of fear. In a performance solidifying his status as Hollywood's #1 male star, Clark Gable is Fletcther Christian, the first officer whose will to obey erodes under Bligh's tyrrany. And Franchot Tone plays Byam, the idealistic midshipman torn by his allegiance to the two men. That all three portrayals are vividly memorable is accented by a bit of music trivia: for the only time in Oscar history, three stars from the same film received Best Actor nominations.", "related": {"also_bought": ["1558807780", "6301975987", "6302360978", "0800100832", "0792836553", "6303402070", "6300987485", "630150528X", "6302226899", "6301797957", "0792837967", "0800113055", "B0000040EJ", "6304291698", "6305123616", "6300182479", "6302413435", "6304119038", "6301971558", "6302424909", "6300208281", "0800116917", "0792838556", "6303057225"], "bought_together": ["0792836553"], "also_viewed": ["B002VWNID6"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 569177}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.95, "brand": "", "asin": "B000056BRJ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51C55MBGZXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Mutiny on the Bounty [VHS]"}

{"description": "Hollywood's loss was Europe's gain when Jules Dassin fled America because of the House Un-American Activities Committee blacklist at the end of the 1940s. His films helped bring the moral ambiguity of the postwar American thriller to Europe, inspiring a new generation of critics and filmmakers. Writing several years before he madeThe 400 Blows, Fran&ccedil;ois Truffaut praised Dassin for the way his films \"combin[ed] the documentary approach with lyricism,\" a method that would inform many of the new wave films of the '60s.Rififi, shot on the rainy streets of Paris, is imbued with the same gritty realism that marked Dassin's earlier work in New York (The Naked City) and London (Night and the City). Jean Servais plays Tony le St&eacute;phanois, an aging crook whose thin lips and tired, seen-it-all eyes give him a look somewhere between Humphrey Bogart and Harry Dean Stanton. Out of jail after a five-year stretch, he joins up with a couple of pals to pull one last heist: a jewel robbery that is portrayed in such detail (including tips on how to silence an alarm using a fire extinguisher) that the film was banned in several countries.The robbery sequence alone, which lasts for 30 minutes and is played entirely without dialogue, would be enough to ensureRififi's classic status, but there's a lot more to enjoy, including terrific performances from Marie Sabouret as Tony's world-weary ex-girlfriend, and from Dassin himself as a dandified Italian safecracker with an eye for the ladies. After the thrill of the heist, in the film's final scenes when, with the inevitability of the bestfilms noirseverything falls apart, Dassin achieves the lyricism that Truffaut admired so much.

{"description": "Keanu Reeves stars in this story that might best be described asBad News Bearsin the projects. Conor O'Neill (Reeves) is a charming ne'er-do-well with a disturbing gambling addiction. His penchant for betting on the wrong teams leaves him owing several thousand dollars to very violent people, and he ends up coaching a children's baseball team to pay off his debt. The movie skimps a bit on process: the kids start out as terrible players and become better but we don't see how; Conor starts caring but we don't see why. As by-the-numbers movies go, though, it isn't a bad one. The young actors in the cast are talented and understated. Most of the kids' characters are only barely fleshed out by the script, but this keeps the movie from being hijacked by extra-cute mugging. Parents should be cautioned--this movie has some very violent scenes that will frighten young children, and swearing is depicted as precocious and adorable. Still, like a baseball game, it isn't a bad way to spend your time.--Ali Davis", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000KHYN9C", "B00004Y2R1", "B00AMEZDJW", "B00000JGHV", "B00BTYPWDQ", "B002O3Z4XY", "B00AEFXOKO", "B0000633U2", "6305505780", "B00005JPK8", "B004GJYROG", "B0012YYZDG", "B00009AOAX", "078324021X", "B00003CY51", "B00AEFYE08", "B002GIBVWA", "B00005M20J", "B00E1HIWU8", "B0006J28MI", "B005SQRYEG", "B001DJLD12", "B0007LLPXI", "630514415X", "B000068NNU", "B0000JBUHI", "B003VE9WTW", "B00AEFXHNI", "B00DW5IKW0", "B000089771", "B000BITV9W", "1558908390", "B0001MMGC2", "B000089778", "B0010YSD90", "B000056VP4", "B00066FAQW", "B00005A3KS", "B00E1HIX66", "B00005JLG1", "B00005JLRZ", "B00028HBES", "6304821832", "0788815466", "B000FS9ULC", "B00AEFXSLE", "B000069I0E", "B001BP4K22", "0783230338", "B002GSXKOM", "B0010YSD8Q", "B00ANDDBBY", "B00DNF1SSC", "B000069I1K", "630592273X", "B0006GAI5U", "B000PE0GRI", "B000EXZFCQ", "B00006SFL7", "B0060ZJ7BC", "B00006LPH6", "B004GJYRF0", "B002VWNICM", "B004499NII", "B00AEFXGWK", "B000063RQO", "B00007BK2S", "B000053VAX", "6305428271", "B000G0O5I2", "B00008979O", "B0009A40NO", "B00005NRO0", "B00DQCSWUE", "B000WD3XKO", "6305065551", "0783230524", "B004WJT5E2", "B000XSWVEC", "B0000YEE6M", "B002CA68N4", "B000MNOX9E", "B009NNM9OA", "B000089773", "B000J10F14", "B00AEBB9UU", "B0006GANOQ", "B00AEFYKWU", "B00AEFXT1S", "B00007LP8J", "B00AEFY17E", "B002NZK5U0", "B0009K7RMA", "B00595W4CI", "B00L4K3MLE", "B000HDZKLO", "B000BOH8X2", "B000FUTVLY", "B00003W8NT", "0783237367"], "bought_together": ["B00AMEZDJW", "B00004Y2R1"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AMEZDJW", "B002O3Z4XY", "B00DNF1SSC", "B005SQRYEG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 10614}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 10.81, "brand": "Team Marketing", "asin": "B00005JKE4", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51R4A6RG4XL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Hardball"}

{"description": "The first disc starts with a 38-minute interview with Salma Hayek that, with her recollections of the film, works the same as a commentary track. Director Julie Taymor takes center stage for the rest of the 2-disc set. Besides an engaging commentary track, there are two interviews with the director, a Q&A; session after an AFI screening, and a better one with Bill Moyers. The second disc is set-up for short (5- to 7-minute) featurettes on the making of the film--production design, cinematography, locations, two visual effects pieces, and so on--but oddly not one with the Oscar-winning make-up crew. All of these segments are better produced and more interesting than most DVD supplements, however there is little biographical information on Frida (letting the movie speak for itself). The music element gets the most attention: an interview with vocalist and Frida's lover Chavela Vargas, Hayek interviewing composer Elliot Goldenthal, and Goldenthal's own commentary track explaining his Oscar-winning score.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0030T120A", "B00005KHJJ", "B000CCCZYA", "B00116GEJ8", "B004XVMCMG", "B0001US61O", "B003ODIV10", "B000BYA4HY", "B005TTEG3O", "0060085894", "B0011FLH14", "B0043CT8GI", "B00006LLNV", "B001CK7OLU", "B000AL72R8", "3822859834", "B0041I97CO", "B000N3T0DW", "B005CFBZ3O", "0060923199", "B003WKQ46E", "B00005JNCZ", "0517592355", "B000WZAE7W", "B0006GANX2", "B0051URXWM", "B000FIHN5M", "B0000A2ZU1", "B001ILTUKQ", "0448426773", "B0009K7RXY", "B0002TT0MI", "B00180IPM6", "3836512645", "B00005N8A9", "B0041KKYF6", "B000NO1XG8", "0810959542", "B000YKYT2G", "1451632835", "B00134PSV8", "B00EV1YZKK", "B000NVI0EY", "B002ZMZBIM", "B00005JLQW", "1452108250", "B00AZMFKXK", "0060166991", "B00005R87F", "B000AM4P90", "B004IF4EVY", "B000EZ9084", "B001CK7OM4", "B000T5O4AI", "B00GJNQ3S0", "0486413500", "0486413667", "B000O76ZQC", "B00008AOX5", "B004U7MR1Y", "B001DJ7PR8", "B00275EGNS", "B003VTKZ8O", "B00E5G03KM", "B000NOIX48", "B0002KPIQY", "0452286867", "B001FM7KRI", "B000063N9O", "B000YIGNCC", "B00005JMJD", "0811800393", "3822858625", "6304806418", "B0031REQKE", "B004CJQVQC", "B00049QJ9I", "0516264664", "B000063K0I", "B00008PHD1", "0780619587", "B001BWYT4E", "B000LV6OC6", "B0016LFG2Y", "B006HAJAGM", "B000K7VHNW", "B00005JH9M", "B000NTPG84", "B0016MJ6T2", "B001QUF3SW", "B00BLYCB1K", "B0019K4YT8", "B0064MT1FI", "B00GPPXNIK", "B003BR8MDQ", "B000AARKOO", "B0015ET3YO", "1573440299", "B000092T3B"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000CCCZYA", "B00005KHJJ", "0060085894", "B004XVMCMG"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 123302}, "asin": "B00005JLPK", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51F4umWFdiL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Frida"}

{"description": "There's only one deleted scene in this two-disc DVD set, but it's a doozy. The \"Sgt. Candy Scene\" is a must-see and, unfortunately, the best thing on the second disc. The rushed HBO documentary shows us far more flash than substance. Better is the Visual Effects Lab that goes more in-depth with four sequences, although you need to wade through a hokey interface for each segment. Making your \"own\" effects isn't that much fun; you can only choose a few effects that change in two scenes. Anyone looking to get the complicated backstory of the trilogy figured out should dig into the \"Sky Net Database\" and an intricate timeline. The two commentary tracks are worth a listen, with director Jonathan Mostow's solo track the better one. The director goes into great detail on how the little things (from lighting street scenes to tricks for destroying buildings) count.  The second track is pieced together from the actors recorded separately. Mostow appears with actress Claire Danes (doing her first commentary track) and their chemistry is enjoyable after a slow start. The other actors have less interesting things to say, including Schwarzenegger who is constantly--yet enthusiastically--selling the film.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001VLBDD0", "B00005N5S5", "B001FB55HQ", "B00005JA8B", "B00070FX5U", "B00007AJG4", "B002ZG98LO", "B000T9OP7G", "B002GHHHME", "B00005JKIP", "B002QFYJFY", "B0002J58HO", "B0000AXE8I", "B001AQO43M", "B00AKGG828", "B00026ZG10", "B0001BKAEY", "B00IZZDWKM", "B001451HXO", "B0000VCZK2", "B000056PMU", "B000BPL2FQ", "B000RW3VCK", "B0004Z33F0", "B000U1ZV8K", "B0045HCJGC", "B0004Z33EQ", "B00005JNTU", "B000HRMAPE", "B00008G8M4", "B000RRS7RE", "B00005JKYX", "B0000VD12I", "B000FC2FQA", "B00000ILDG", "B00000G3PA", "B00005JMZK", "B000MGBSE4", "B0087ZG7J8", "B0004Z33EG", "B000P0J0AQ", "B00005JMEW", "B0087ZG7NO", "B00003CXTA", "B0002CHK1S", "B000RJO56E", "B00177YA1K", "B00004STDN", "B005COLETU", "B001AK3S4Y", "B000VNMMR0", "B0000959N0", "B00005JMUA", "1558908846", "6305767866", "B001RIY4WE", "B0049IHX2C", "B000VI70QS", "B000EGDB10", "B002GSXKN8", "B00HZMZ2FE", "B0045HCJ9O", "B003QO8TOQ", "B00005JNJV", "B001451HX4", "B00I9TDMRM", "B0006GANOQ", "B00003CXSP", "6305428115", "B00016MSV2", "B00005JOC9", "B000TJBN80", "B009MO57H6", "B000O77SQS", "B0087ZG7HK", "B001OST0M6", "B005LAIHXQ", "B0002J4X1Q", "B0002V7OI8", "B0015XHP2C", "6304806434", "B000QXDED6", "B00005JL3K", "B008JFUPFI", "B003PIUINS", "0783225946", "0792839056", "B00005N7Z1", "B0006GAO6I", "B001DZOC6Y", "B00005JL78", "B001HN697M", "B00IJS2OXG", "B002NXSRVG", "B00008G8M5", "B00005JN0T", "B003XURDAY", "B000O77SRM", "B006VRRGNK", "B00F4FFO8E"], "bought_together": ["B001VLBDD0", "B00005N5S5"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001VLBDD0", "B00005N5S5", "B001FB55HQ", "B002JT6AO0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 115564}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 13.47, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00005JM0B", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5143TFPX8SL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "In terms of alluring female nudity,Swimming Poolshows a lot, but it's what remains concealed that gives this erotic thriller a potent, voyeuristic charge. With his Hitchcockian handling of secrets and lies, prolific French director Fran&#xE7;ois Ozon reunites with hisUnder the Sandstar, Charlotte Rampling, to tell a seductive tale of murder and complicity, beginning when British mystery novelist Sarah Morton (Rampling) seeks peace and relaxation at her publisher's French villa, only to find his brash, sexually liberated daughter Julie (Ludivine Sagnier) arriving shortly thereafter to disrupt her solitary reverie. What begins as mutual annoyance turns into something more sinister and duplicitous, alternating between Julie's predatory sex with men and Sarah's observant, perhaps jealous fascination. These two women, generations apart, share in Ozon's delicate dance of trust, curiosity, and gradual understanding, until a twist ending that forces you to reevaluate everything you've seen. Only then will the mysteries ofSwimming Poolbe fully and tantalizingly revealed. (Note: The unrated version contains full-frontal nudity that's been edited from the rated version. In both versions, the overall plot is not affected.)--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000PKG8TM", "B000F0UUD2", "B00023P4I8", "B0019K4YT8", "B000TXPXAU", "B000EZ9084", "B004SUDQC2", "B00003JRAV", "B006M3M5FM", "B0009GX1XI", "076782170X", "B001AIQ14A", "B000069HV1", "B001C5LLVE", "B000HEWEWG", "B000FWHW68", "B001CRC4DG", "B00008G7UL", "B000BGH29K", "B002AT4JNI", "B002AS463W", "B00008972P", "B000VLCRCW", "B00GPPXNIK", "B00005QJIG", "B002T4GY4Q", "6305428484", "B00007J5VT", "B004HHX9OQ", "B000CBG5PG", "B003XKNGNW", "B00GRZPRB4", "B0000ZMGWK", "B0015FHDWM", "B0004Z32NI", "B005XB8T68", "B004SEUJEG", "0783230559", "B00B022GVS", "B001LMU1NC", "B0040J1RX6", "B0031DRZEC", "B00AKLLSNC", "B006CR2PD0", "B00E8G5HXM", "B004GBMVTW", "0780022823", "B00049QJBG", "B002DQSKMY", "B00005JMU1", "B006Z7Z3VS", "B0007W6HVM", "B001AZKB8K", "6305132917", "B007V6ON9A", "B001TR4G7G", "B004EI2NM2", "B0002JZT5A", "B00INUK5WM", "B003ODKZTQ", "B000BBOUUE", "B00GXHO03C", "B006OT0UUQ", "B00177Y9TS", "B0010SAGHS", "B001URA5YI", "B0020LH8WU", "B000EQ5SRK", "B000HT38EO", "B0079K4WEE", "B002VECLXC", "B004XYABMQ", "B00CPTUO1Y", "B004XIWRW4", "B007XF0XUW", "B00005V4XV", "B001CIOCNK", "B00FB349R6", "B00009W0U4", "B003B2UK1S", "B00DPJEWDO", "B0009WDVUK", "B003VOVW0O", "B00005JL57", "B00AFDN5Y0", "B00C8CQ5SO", "630549570X", "B00AYGVCCK", "B00368PSNC", "B005Z9MGRG", "B004GGQN1E", "B00005JMJD", "B0009GX1CE"], "bought_together": ["B000PKG8TM", "B000F0UUD2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["076782170X", "B002AS463W", "B006M3M5FM", "B000TXPXAU"]}, "price": 6.54, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 14811}, "asin": "B00005JMIJ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51V52AGRPXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Swimming Pool (Unrated Version)"}

{"description": "Like any DVD blockbuster from producer Jerry Bruckheimer, the extras are plentiful and often a bit too self-congratulatory (worst offender here is the primary commentary track). The slickly (natch) produced making-of documentary goes through the standard routine; however, the less-flashy \"fly on the wall\" bits--just showing what happens on set without comment--is more fun, offering effortless insight on the filmmaking process. The best treasure is a nifty interactive history on pirates with plenty of background material. You can simply play the filmed segments or take a tour around a ship to discover the material (and a few surprises). There's a lot of archival material on the theme-park ride that inspired the film and several odds and ends including an enjoyable chronicle of the vintage ship's voyage from its home harbor to the movie set. The kids should really dig the DVD-ROM \"Moonlight Becomes Ye,\" in which they can turn their own mug into a ghostly pirate. There's also a bounty of extended and deleted scenes (19 in all) and a very funny blooper reel. With both DTS and Dolby 5.1, sound systems will get a workout with the excellent (and loud) sound design.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000I0RQVI", "B000U7WV1Y", "B005COPWZW", "B004A8ZWUQ", "B00005JN5E", "B0013BM63O", "B006VRRGNK", "B00005JKZV", "B00005JPH2", "B0014Z4OMU", "B00E5I2MCM", "B00003CWT6", "B004DTLK80", "B00005JKZY", "B0000A1RJI", "B004M1A21K", "B004DTLK7G", "B00003CXZ1", "B001HN694K", "B001E75QH0", "B00E5I2M6I", "B00005JKCH", "B0087ZG7HK", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B000E6EK2Y", "B000E8M0VA", "B003UYUQZW", "B00AEFYGBA", "B000W746GK", "B00005JMQW", "B0083SBMBM", "B001DHXT20", "B0002234LS", "B000W7F5SS", "B002PMV9FG", "B0002KVUKM", "B004EPYZUS", "B0053FANRC", "B00BEZTMFY", "6304806434", "B000VR0570", "0783231644", "B001OQCV6A", "B000AYELVA", "B008JFUO72", "B005G4TJUC", "B00004R99S", "B00023B1LC", "B00E5I2M9K", "B00003CXI1", "B001HQZJMU", "B00000IRE6", "B0002ZDVEU", "B008QE9XD2", "B00F84H73Q", "B00E5I2MEK", "B003Y5H5EW", "B007K3JFUQ", "B003QO8TOQ", "B000NQRR1Q", "B000YPUF9W", "B001EZE5BU", "B004A8ZWSS", "B0009MDPYM", "B00LG6YEKE", "B002ZG980U", "B002ZG994U", "B000U1ZV8K", "B001DZ8TRW", "B00005JLR2", "B000VWYJ86", "B00AZMFJYA", "B001GZ6QC4", "B00000JQB5", "B004XKCZAG", "B000W796OM", "B001GCUO0W", "B00AQSN7HE", "B00000ILDH", "B0053FANT0", "B0000VAFO0", "B0002IQMAM", "B000HRMAPE", "B004LWZW7Y", "B008UZA8FY", "B0001HLVS2", "B00007AJGH", "B00005JNJV", "B003YAR97K", "B00CHVJODE", "B000UR9T8C", "B0049IHX2C", "B000G6BLW4", "B00177YA1K", "0783227345", "B0014Z4ON4", "B001TK80C0", "B002O5M4T4", "B00AEBBA72", "B00005JOC9"], "bought_together": ["B000I0RQVI", "B000U7WV1Y"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005COPWZW", "B000I0RQVI", "B0071JADFU", "B00005JPFX"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 6260}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.23, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B00005JM5E", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51fX40gGdXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)"}
{"description": "There's a pretty good gimmick with these DVD extras aimed squarely at the pre-teen/early teen audience that ate up this film. Each of the extras (a standard making-of featurette, an alternate ending, and an interesting deleted scene) is followed by a clue afterwards. Decipher the clues and unlock the next set of extras: a nice bit on real treasure hunters, an awful piece on the Knights Templar, and one gem for kids: \"Riley Poole's Decode this!\" Actor Justin Bartha reprises his role (Nic Cage's techno-sidekick) and lectures a bit on the cooler side of language history and code-breaking with a few simple interactive games. If you get through it all, you unlock a hidden feature, a trivia track. Thankfully, those who do not want to go on the treasure hunt can access these features by reading the printed insert.

{"description": "Opposites are forced to attract inAlong Came Polly, a dose of featherweight fluff that could've been better and could've been worse--surely no pairing of Ben Stiller and Jennifer Aniston can be a complete waste of time, right? Faint praise indeed, but fans of these mainstream funny-folk will enjoy this movie as a lazy-weekend distraction. Ben's a newlywed insurance risk-assessment analyst whose wife (Debra Messing, in a throwaway role) betrays him on their honeymoon. His uptight, play-it-safe lifestyle (which includes acute aversion to germs and irritable bowel syndrome) makes him seemingly incompatible with the spontaneous, free-spirited Polly (Aniston), but writer-director John Hamburg (whose writing credits include the previous Stiller hitsMeet the ParentsandZoolander) is determined to give them at least theappearanceof romantic potential.

{"description": "Literary adaptations just don't get any better than director Joe Wright's 2005 version of Jane Austen'sPride & Prejudice. The key word here isadaptation, because Wright and gifted screenwriter Deborah Moggach have taken liberties with Austen's classic novel that purists may find objectionable, but in this exquisite film their artistic decisions are entirely justified and exceptionally well executed. It's a more rural England that we see here, circa 1790 (as opposed to Austen's early 19th century), in which Elizabeth Bennet (Keira Knightley) is one of several sisters primed for marriage, with an anxious mother (Brenda Blethyn) only too desperate to see her daughters paired off with the finest, richest husbands available. Elizabeth is strong-willed and opinionated, but her head (not to mention her pride and prejudice) lead her heart astray when she meets the wealthy Mr. Darcy (Matthew Macfadyen), whose own sense of decency and discretion (not to mentionhispride and prejudice) prevent him from expressing his mutual affection. They're clearly meant for each other, and as Knightley's performance lights up the screen (still young enough to be girlishly impertinent, yet wise beyond her 20 years), Austen's timeless romance yields yet another timeless adaptation, easily on par with the belovedBBC miniseriesthat has been embraced by millions since originally broadcast in 1995. Individual tastes will vary as to which version should be considered \"definitive,\" but with a stellar supporting cast including Judi Dench and Donald Sutherland, this impeccable production achieves its own kind of perfection.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_viewed": ["0800141660", "B00003JRCQ", "B00G6HO368", "B004SIP7AS", "B004P7CNZO", "B0053Q9DHW", "B000244FDW", "B000GRUQKQ", "B000244FFU", "B0018YCF50", "B001L57ZZG", "B004XVMCMQ", "B00AF82WTO", "B008D1RCHC", "B000Z27HLS", "B000BEZQ0Y", "0767851013", "0486284735", "B0002ZH5PQ", "B0012Q3T6I", "6303921248", "B002XTBE6K", "B001PJRAUS", "B00HYMBAQ0", "B0080QOL1A", "B00062IZ0Y", "B001C4AFOY", "B0012XIGVE", "B002KHNFFS", "B000244FF0", "B0012OVCE6", "B00HYMASS6", "B0009UZGAA", "B000784WMW", "0767020308", "B000LPQ6DE", "B001TJYFRU", "B000FTCEYQ", "B000ZS8GW6", "B005GRF2UK", "B004FM2EL2", "B00G7QPXAI", "149440477X", "B009ERK0SW", "B00006ZXSK", "B0000AUHPK", "B004UOHNCA", "0767020294", "B00094AS9U", "B000Z27HMW", "B002DY9KR0", "B000N4SHOE", "B000683VI4", "193799418X"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00G6HO368", "0800141660", "B00003JRCQ", "B005S9EK5Y"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "asin": "B00005JOHI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZGC68T2JL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Pride &amp; Prejudice"}

{"description": "From the acclaimed director of SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE, PROOF stars Oscar(R) winners Gwyneth Paltrow (Best Actress, SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE, 1998) and Anthony Hopkins (Best Actor, SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, 1991), along with Jake Gyllenhaal (JARHEAD, BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN) and Hope Davis (ABOUT SCHMIDT). It's a powerful story of a young woman haunted by her father's past and the shadow of her own future.

{"description": "Helen Mirren reigns supreme inThe Queen, a witty and ingenious look at a moment that rocked the house of Windsor:  the week that followed the sudden death of Princess Diana in 1997. Diana's death came at just the same time that Prime Minister Tony Blair (played by the bright Michael Sheen) was settling into his new government--and trying to figure out the delicate relationship between 10 Downing Street and Queen Elizabeth II (Mirren). A large portion of the British population was trying to figure out the Windsors that week, as Elizabeth remained stiff-upper-lip and largely mum about the death of the beloved princess. In Peter Morgan's skillful script, we watch as Blair grows increasingly impatient with the Royals, who are sequestered in their Scottish estate while the public demands some show of grief. Prince Philip (James Cromwell, in good form) clumsily decides to take Diana's sons hunting, while a sympathetically-treated Prince Charles (Alex Jennings) displays some frustration with his mother's eerie calm.None of this conveys how funny the film is, or how deftly it flows from one scene to the next. Director Stephen Frears (Dirty Pretty Things) deserves great credit for that, and for the performances, and for the movie's marvelous sense of well-roundedness; you could see this movie and groan at the cluelessness of the Royals and their outmoded existence, or you might just sympathize with showing reserve in a world that values gross public displays of emotion. But either way, you'll marvel at Mirren, who makes the Queen far more alert and human than one might ever have imagined.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B003UESJH4", "B001C4AFOY", "B004M9QNVK", "B004GXKBDI", "B0059XTUVI", "B000Z8H0IC", "B000ZOXDFA", "B000RF7XYO", "B001L57ZZG", "B001TH92N4", "B000BKDNX0", "B0006Q93H4", "B000EOTELI", "B004XYOQU4", "B009TT0BSE", "B0012QE4Q2", "B001QUF3SW", "B007HW8U2Y", "B000EHQUGC", "B00342ANSA", "B004SIP9U6", "B000V02CNW", "B00005O7N8", "B00GM7STPI", "B003N9ASF2", "B002ZG99EK", "B004SIP71M", "B003Y5H4Y8", "B0001I55M4", "B001AZIRVI", "B00015HXDG", "B000E1NXJ0", "B000RF7XYY", "B00121QGPY", "B009AMANBA", "B000M06KJ8", "B000MEYJHY", "B00005JOFQ", "B007TBJUVI", "B0085A9JXG", "B003AND1SM", "B000NIVJF4", "B0010X73Z6", "B000K7VHQE", "B00005JKNF", "B000MCH5P4", "B001TR4G6W", "B004P7CNZO", "B0050PYNN0", "B000GH3CR0", "B00AEFY8MM", "B0068MNO4S", "B002RSDW80", "B001MVWFAO", "B004ZNFTDQ", "B000255LIY", "B000V6LSOA", "B00ARX2VZW", "B000G6BM0K", "B008220C38"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003UESJH4", "B004M9QNVK", "B001C4AFOY", "B004GXKBDI"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "asin": "B00005JPAM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51K34G0GCBL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Queen"}

{"description": "While much was made of the fact thatMarie Antoinetteelicited boos at Cannes, the many favorable reviews attracted less attention. Inspired by Antonia Fraser's biography, Sofia Coppola fashions a portrait that's just as dreamy asThe Virgin Suicides, her first literary adaptation, and the Oscar-winningLost in Translation. Set to a soundtrack of post-punk (a conceit that adds more interest than resonance), the teenaged Marie (Kirsten Dunst, quite good) may be shallow, but she's rarely unsympathetic. The story begins in the late-18th century as the Austrian Archduchess agrees to marry Louis-Auguste (Jason Schwartzman). After bidding adieu to her mother, Maria Theresa (Marianne Faithfull), she travels to France, where King Louis XV (Rip Torn) sets the rules--and the list is endless (Judy Davis' Comtesse de Noailles is the primary enforcer). As for the Dauphin, he's just a boy, really, with more interest in his key collection than their marriage bed. Should Marie produce an heir, it might be enough to sustain her--since life is nothing but an endless shopping spree--but clouds gather on the horizon as an impoverished populace rises up against their extravagant leaders. Coppola merely suggests what happens next, although history paints a darker picture. Filmed in and around the Chateau of Versailles,Marie Antoinetteis a riot of rustling gowns, sparkling jewels, and Manolo Blahnik-designed shoes. To say that style trumps substance does its maker a disservice, but the look of the thing does leave the deepest impression.--Kathleen C.

{"description": "One might reasonably expectTomcatsto be thePorky'sof 2001: after all, it concerns a group of young, sexist morons and their fears and fantasies about young women. ButTomcatsisn't quite as brain-dead as that, though it is phenomenally more neurotic. Jerry O'Connell plays one of two remaining bachelors within a group of wealthy pals who set aside a cash reward, years before, earmarked for the last among them to get married. O'Connell needs the money to pay off a gambling debt, but his problem is that the other bachelor is a horrendous pig (Jake Busey) unlikely ever to land a gal. A general mean-spiritedness flows through this wearying comedy, manifest in such ugly moments as watching someone's girlfriend run over by a golf cart and an excised, cancerous testicle kicked around hospital hallways. If you're looking for female flesh, however, forget it:Tomcatsis far more driven to explore male nudity, while making equally naked today's masculine fears of impotence, mothers, and lesbians.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00007149R", "B000038I0Y", "B00260HH1W", "B00000F0AD", "B0009P42WI", "B0023TCWE8", "B000069HQ2", "B000Y7U93C", "B00003CXK7", "B00BLN4UPG", "B00005KA6V", "0792840127", "B002WN8IPW", "B00004TX5U", "B00441GYVA", "B0045HCIYA", "0767824954", "B00005JCCB", "6305907110", "B00009AOBM", "B00AEFXVW0", "B002ZG98KK", "B00005AVS9", "B000IZJZIU", "B004P7CN7W", "B00007AJGM", "B005LAIH9A", "B000063JDM", "B001L9EXTS", "6305161860", "B00HZMZ2FE", "B000031WD9", "078322799X", "B00005V9HR", "B00005K3OS", "B00AEFZ3XU", "B000FP2OPO", "B0039ZBLVU", "B0000C3I96", "B0051MKNRC", "B001CC7PRQ", "B00049QJBG", "B000OVLBHG", "B000BUE5E6", "B00004ZETA", "B000F6ZIIS", "B00006ADFT", "B001KKU9DW", "B000K405CY", "B004SEUJ9Q", "B00441GYVK", "B00005JMX6", "B001C0JCBA", "B002SG7Z7A", "6304779631", "B00009PY3X", "B004LWZW6K", "B00177YA06", "B00000IQW4", "B000CPH9PM", "B00008EYA5", "B001AEF6C2", "B001OD4S50", "B00018D42W", "B00DMDE02Q", "B00003CWOL", "B00003CXGJ", "B0006A9FIM", "B004EPYZS0", "B000E6EHE0", "B00AEFYZCU", "B005QX8UEE", "B00AEFXPG2", "B002XMGGK6", "B00013WWT8", "B001CIOCNK", "B00003CXKA", "0767807588", "B002DQSKMY", "B00005QW6W", "B000C20VS2", "B004SIP9X8", "0767817745", "B00003CXWS", "B00AEFY854", "B000089773", "B00005UQ9W", "B000BKVQS4", "B00004TJMW", "B00005N5QW", "B000PAAJZ6", "B0014G31QE", "B00005JMCT", "B005GT3X68", "B00000J122", "B00007ELEQ", "B004SEUIZG", "B004SIP8ES", "B002E01LL6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000038I0Y", "B00007149R", "B00005JMX6"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 132049}, "asin": "B00005LQ03", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HDJQK%2BbnL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Tomcats"}

{"description": "The tantalizing genre of food films--stretching fromBabette's FeasttoBig Nightand beyond--has a delicious new addition,Tortilla Soup. The food-preparation scenes will make your mouth water. Fortunately, the rest of the movie holds up as well. Hector Elizondo plays Martin, a widowed chef who is losing both his sense of taste and control over his three daughters: Leticia (the always superb Elizabeth Pe&ntilde;a), a religious schoolteacher; Carmen (Jacqueline Obradors), a successful but unhappy businesswoman still carrying on an affair with her ex-boyfriend; and Maribel (Tamara Mello), a rebellious teen falling in love with a young Brazilian. When a pushy, nosy, but very sexy widow named Hortensia (Raquel Welch) comes along, the troublesome subcurrents in the family start to surface. Elizondo's understated gravitas anchors the story, while the three sisters have sex, eat amazing-looking food, and break plates in the kitchen.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004XVMCMG", "B000AM4P90", "B000092T3G", "B0007QJ210", "B00005JKG1", "B000JLTRHM", "B00DJYJQ6I", "B004SIP6BI", "B004K4FUQQ", "B00005JPSM", "B0001CNQX0", "B000KJU15U", "B003TY2SNG", "0767802535", "B000067J24", "B00KQTGWPC", "B00180IPM6", "B00007J5VO", "B005HFI7IU", "B00JPFTSWM", "B00KQTHKQC", "B00007ELFA", "B005SW2RTC", "076780421X", "B005FIXA6S", "B00005M0EK", "B000EHRVOW", "B00066FAQW", "B001RTKKRQ", "B003L20INS", "B0001V6ZK2", "B003E1QDAI", "B003NF97NK", "B002RSDW80", "B00CEIOGZG", "B000GJ0LLI", "B000N3SU6K", "B00005JKGK", "B001LK8UP0", "B004EPYZNK", "B0001ZMXGI", "B00005JNCZ", "B000P0J0CY", "B0007IO6NM", "B000JJ5G4M", "B000053VBK", "B0002DRDK0", "B00G35R9ZK", "B0014BQR6U", "B002E01LOI", "B0042EJDGM", "B00006FMUW", "B007UW9WOQ", "B00JO739MG", "B00441GYRO", "B000LXHK2C", "B000065U1R", "B00007G1YP", "B000RHRGSK", "B0011FLH14", "B00AEFYHVO", "B0045HCJJ4", "B00A2H9UG6", "B002HR456E", "6305212112", "B00GJNQ3S0", "B003L16FCC", "B00004RJ71", "B003X3BYJM", "B00005V9IA", "B0002TT0MI", "B00006ZXSI", "B00CEIOH9G", "B00008G7UF", "0767821637", "B0002DRDY6", "B00AZMFKXK", "B001LPWGBY", "B00000J122", "B0000542C9", "B001ECDVJU", "B0038N9X3Q", "B000YDBPAM", "6306012419", "B000MQC9H4", "B0045HCJ76", "B0002DRDIW", "630560097X", "B000C3L2PC", "0767817737", "B0001I55M4", "B00FZ4KR4U", "B005S9EJ14", "B00BY0EBK0", "B0000VD02Y", "B001CIOCLC", "B0018YCF50", "B000LV6OC6", "0806143576"], "bought_together": ["B004XVMCMG", "B004SIP6BI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000AM4P90", "B004XVMCMG", "B0007QJ210", "B0001CNQX0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 24178}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.29, "brand": "ELIZONDO,HECTOR", "asin": "B00005TNEQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51cg-Qiop5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Tortilla Soup"}
{"description": "With one innocent click of the camera, a young widowed mother enters a frightening nightmare that ultimately may lead to decades behind bars. It was nothing more than spontaneous family fun when Jen Bradley's (Mare Winningham, \"St. Elmo's Fire,\" TV Emmy winner for \"George Wallace,\" Academy Award nomination for \"Georgia\") daughters are photographed by their mother's childhood friend, Carrie Dixon, (Felicity Huffman, \"Magnolia,\" Golden Globe Nominee for TV's \"Sports Night\") a professional photographer. No one would expect that these innocent shots of her young children would spark a police investigation of child pornography and abuse. What sounds like an absurd joke turns into a harrowing reality that carries a 50-year prison sentence for Jen.Pursuing the case with a vengeance is Detective John Collins, who seems to care little for the truth. Most troubling to Collins and the prosecutor, is the vast number of shots taken of the scantily clad girls in seemingly suggestive poses. To the bewilderment of all but the legal system, the case goes to trial, where Jen faces the real prospect of losing her children forever. But the determined mother refuses to back down from a relentless prosecutor and a hardened judge. She is confident that Carrie's photos are nothing more than the everyday images that comprise a family's photo album. While the camera never lies, Jen realizes that the real danger is in who interprets the film.

{"description": "Richard Burton stars in this exciting story of the stubborn, courageous men who held Rommel at bay in North Africa despite hopelessly outnumbered.  The year is 1941, and Rommel has the British in full retreat.  All that stands between him and the Suez Canal is the fortress of Tobruk, manned by a small army of Australian troops who are ordered to hold this vital position at any cost.  Many of the men are green recruits, and it falls to Capt. MacRoberts (Burton) to whip them into shape.  A bold tactician who realizes they will soon be overwhelmed if they do not take the offensive, MacRoberts leads countless daredevil raids that keep the superior enemy off-balance and earn his men the famous nickname they \"won with blood and bore with pride.\"  Directed by Robert Wise and co-starring James Mason in a reprise performance as Field Marshall Rommel (whom he first played in \"The Desert Fox\"), this stirring blend of action and history pays tribute to the heroic men known in the annals of war as The Desert Rats.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00008AOTO", "B000E5N6KW", "B00008AOTR", "B0001NBMH6", "B00096S4BM", "B00005PJ8K", "B0015S2OWI", "B00005OSJQ", "B000NTPG6Q", "B0007TKNGA", "B000H1RFSM", "B005HQBO9I", "B000A2WJBQ", "B004GSVXBW", "B000O78L0U", "0792841662", "B000NO1XJA", "B000EMGJFE", "B00005N5S3", "B005DTZXPA", "B00AEFXLKC", "B000MGBLIC", "B000MGTQ7U", "B0001NBMHQ", "B0001WTWWE", "B004IFYMXO", "B000062XEX", "B000EHSVSC", "B004VGHF7K", "B00005R23T", "B00005B1YH", "0792844017", "B00005ASGB", "B00005QCVP", "B00005JN9P", "B003AWRMCO", "B0029778T8", "B0007TKNLU", "B004IFYMXE", "B00AEFYBA6", "B00CHYSSME", "0792841670", "B00005B1YF", "B0001NBMGC", "B008A1TWXC", "B004XWGZBY", "B0005C9MQ6", "B0001NBMI0", "B00005JP3T", "0792839730", "B00008MTY1", "B004176JJY", "B000063URX", "B0001FVDIC", "B00BY0EBK0", "B005HQBO9S", "B00005PJ8S", "B000E0WJN2", "B000EHSVVO", "B00005PJ8L", "B000EHSVS2", "B00441GYYC", "B00096S4DA", "B0009UVCQW", "0792843576", "B004U7EIES", "B00008PC0Y", "B0000AMRUP", "B000ASDFHC", "B00005N5S2", "B004R6EFAO", "B0000639EI", "B00143XE0U", "B000CNESN0", "B000H1RFQ4", "B000U1ZV6M", "B0008ENHU8", "B000063URW", "B005DTZXL4", "B00004XPPC", "B00008AOTN", "B003B3NV5E", "B000EHSVVE", "B004R6EF9U", "B00008DDGW", "B00096S4BW", "B001PO556E", "B002DNLT1Q", "B000FZETR0", "B00008AOTM", "B000TLTCPO", "B0006B2A42", "B005DIA0IQ", "B000MRA542", "B000NTPG66", "B0002V8OAK", "B001PO55LE", "B000O599Z8", "B000O599VC", "B00008R9M6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000E5N6KW", "B00008AOTR", "B00008AOTO", "B0007TKNGA"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 132036}, "asin": "B000063US0", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/511M855JFNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Desert Rats"}
{"description": "Retelling a story that has made it onto the silver screen more than most, this latest adaptation of The Count of Monte Cristo makes yet another swashbuckling attempt to win over a new generation of cinema goers. A dashing James Caviezel takes the role of the Count, who is driven by a desire for revenge after being betrayed by his best friend Fernand (played by a dishevelled Guy Pearce) and landed with 16 years of solitary confinement in Chateau D'If, a damp cavernous prison. Thus the scene is set for a good old-fashioned romp. The trouble with this \"re-imagining\" (to borrow a phrase from Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes) is that it's never quite sure whether to take itself seriously or not. Alexandre Dumas's original story is a traditionally melodramatic tale of deceit and double-crossing, with clear-cut bad guys and a moral lesson to be learned at the end. Here, director Kevin Reynolds appears unsure about whether to stick with tradition or bring the story up to date and turn it into a post-modern play on the old Victorian values and style. When the Count and his heavy-breathing loved one are reunited, their kiss is actually framed as a cameo. Both lead actors are also prone to heavy bouts of overacting, garnishing their performances with exaggerated baroque gestures. Clearly this is a film in which the actors could over-indulge themselves and (almost) get away with it, were it not for the fact that--bar Richard Harris as the \"Priest\"--none of them seem to have the faintest idea about how to conduct themselves in a period drama. This Count of Monte Cristo will leave the audience a little confused as to whether they should cry along with the story or laugh along with the actors. --Nikki Disney On the DVD: The Count of Monte Cristo on disc offers no escape from the dry drawl of director Kevin Reynolds, who features in almost every element of the extensive extras package. With a shy studio disclaimer before his commentary, he's got a refreshingly frank attitude to", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792839137", "6305428077", "B001EAWMGA", "B000U34PM6", "B000CEXGAU", "B00DCRE87O", "B000ARXF96", "B00004YA66", "B0002HOEPI", "B000BFJM26", "B002U0KHNS", "B00BC0JGUW", "B00005NRO0", "B0064MT1L2", "B000A50442", "B000HC2LZS", "1411469488", "B002AK9URM", "076781505X", "0140449264", "B0007N19X2", "B002VWNID6", "0800141601", "B00062IVOY", "0822003260", "B0002235R6", "B000ENC5YW", "B000P0J0EW", "B00006ZXSO", "B000056PMU", "9626340398", "B00AEFYUQQ", "B000056VP4", "B00CHMBQM0", "B005S9EK5Y", "B001ECDVJU", "B000NVT0SO", "B0001NBMEE", "B00006L949", "B00AEFYO5I", "B0002TSZI8", "B00005LOL0", "B0002YLCG0", "B004SIP75S", "B00081U7HC", "B00004TJJV", "0553213504", "B004SIP9RO", "6304765266", "6304711905", "B00096S4DK", "B0006N2EZ0", "B002K0WBXW", "B000093FLA", "B00AEBB8YW", "B00AEFZ2DG", "B00006ZXSK", "B006P0FIGU", "B002GHHHJC", "0783222149", "B00005JM5B", "B000YGDNPO", "B004IK30MI", "B00096S49Y", "B00860YICC", "6304711891", "B00006ZXSI", "B000FVQLQQ", "B00005JMOW", "B00866JL96", "B000LP6KNU", "B00005PJ8T", "B00004WG2F", "B00000G3PA", "6305428115", "6305692688", "B000E1ZBGS", "B001ECDVK4", "B00000F4ZY", "B00AEFXESQ", "B00028HBKM", "B0041SI78O", "B000BITVBA", "B00003CXFV", "B004SIP7ZS", "B001E75QH0", "6305213283", "6305416222", "B00066FB52", "B0034G4P94", "B00AEBB9NM", "B000P0J0DS", "B00DHHWXYY", "6305127646", "6305236569", "B009LDD1H6", "6305128952", "B00005ATZT", "B0074JOUHE", "6304698798"], "bought_together": ["0792839137", "6305428077"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0792839137", "0140449264", "B000CEXGAU", "B000U34PM6"]}, "price": 12.5, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 231677}, "asin": "B000063W1R", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51LYMHVq8EL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Count of Monte Cristo [Region 2]"}

{"description": "As Kevin Smith observes in his 2002 introduction to the DVD, Ron Mann's  1989 documentaryComic Book Confidentialhasn't lost a bit of its  relevance. It emerged as comics were enjoying a popular renaissance, whenFrank Millerwas  redefining theBatmanmythos in the mainstream, and scores of  independent artists found their unique voices in the burgeoning aftermath  of the underground comix explosion of the '60s and early '70s. Mann's  irreverent sensibilities are perfectly suited to this graphically kinetic  history of comic books from the early '30s to the late '80s, itself  presented as a graphic hybrid of comic art, archival footage, and lively  interviews. All of the major players are included from each era, and Mann's  masterstroke--having latter-day comics innovators read from their  work--makes for some delicious storytelling straight from the source.  Stories from each featured artist are included as another DVD bonus, making this a must-have document for any  serious devotee of the medium.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B00EE8AJ50", "B00E4Q6UVY", "B003ZHR6Q6", "B00006672S", "0385348584", "B001DHXSYO", "B008MZZCZI", "B000ELL1RG", "B000Y5CJNC", "B000AABKZE", "B00LT1JHLW", "B00KTFJ79Q", "B000FJRWF2", "B009B8YZ8U", "B00006AUJG", "B001FZG4K4", "B00BGQ2N66", "B00JM58C22", "0061992119", "B004SIP6S6", "B0002YCVEC", "1606995529", "B000063V8T", "B004ECLQ6W", "B00HMOWA0A", "B008E70EG6", "0785144889", "1613771975", "B008RTE08E", "B002MFF1UU", "B0058YPN0U", "B00KXEM6XM", "B0000AFX64", "B00DZP1C2W", "B0038M2RLC", "B0001NBMIK", "B00BN3DZZA", "B00ENNBZ68", "B004KAB5BE", "B000A9QKLO", "B000EHQTZO", "B00KDU8HQQ", "B00FM4S7KO", "140123710X", "B0001NBLYK", "B00ALTQRRK", "140124758X", "B000P0J09C", "B00IO03I84", "B00H0EN98E", "B00IKM5OCO", "B008QE9YDQ", "0767830555", "B000P0J092", "B0030E5PYY", "B00DP9MDE4", "B00K2CHW48", "B0087ZG7OI", "B00GJ6HQDI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00EE8AJ50", "B00E4Q6UVY", "B00006672S", "B003ZHR6Q6"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 61369}, "asin": "B000067IY3", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61G56ZA516L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Comic Book Confidential"}
{"description": "From the studio that brought you REMEMBER THE TITANS comes an inspirational film based on a true story. Jim Morris (Dennis Quaid), father, teacher, and high school coach, thought his dream was over. He'd had his shot playing baseball, blew out his shoulder, and retired without ever making it to the big leagues. Then, in 1999, Coach Morris made a fateful bet with his perpetually losing team. If they won the district championship, Morris -- who threw a 98 mph fastball -- would try out for the majors. The team went from worst to first, and Jim, living up to his end of the bargain, threw caution to the wind and was on the road to becoming the oldest rookie in the major leagues. This heartfelt, uplifting story about not giving up on your dreams is a remarkable and affecting story that will have everyone cheering.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0068FZ0GK", "B000MNOX94", "B004X2TYG2", "B0000633U2", "B0012YYZDG", "B0007LLPXI", "B00005M20J", "B00009AOAX", "0792843592", "B000J3OTT6", "0800177258", "B00AEFXHNI", "B0010YSD90", "B000056VP4", "B00004W221", "B000069I1K", "B00028HBES", "B005SQRYEG", "B0001US66Y", "B00DW5IKW0", "B00005JPBO", "B000EXZFCQ", "B0000524E4", "B00DNF1SSC", "B000MNOX9E", "B0036APHRC", "B00AATUZLU", "B0007LLPWO", "B000FOPPDI", "B008H6GHHY", "B001KRCDT8", "B004GJYRF0", "B000FTCLRG", "B0019ESNG4", "B000CNFC76", "B00F3LSXPA", "B003VE9WTW", "B00720ONHM", "B00004TJQJ", "B0000DZTNB", "B0008JIJ2E", "B000X5RBXG", "B0002WZTOI", "6305428387", "B0006FYOTC", "B004DK5CW4", "B00008EY60", "B00009AVA4", "B001LXIDVI", "B00006SFL7", "B001BSBBF8", "B000KLQUS0", "B004J713LK", "B00BFE33SQ", "6305428352", "B00E1HIWTO", "0783225733", "B00008O38G", "B000065V42", "B00005JKVU", "B0087F7VSY", "B000068QPY", "B007TGOJLE", "B001YV504U", "B000YGGNMO", "B000P0J09W"], "bought_together": ["B0068FZ0GK", "B000MNOX94"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0068FZ0GK", "B004X2TYG2", "B000J3OTT6", "B0007LLPXI"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 105793}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.5, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B000068DBE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510YP5SNYNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Rookie (Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "South Parkexploded on the pop culture landscape like a dirty  bomb in 1997, and the 13 episodes that comprise the groundbreaking first season  have lost none of their subversive impact. IfSeinfeldwas a show about  nothing, thenSouth Parkis a show about everything, from important moral  lessons in compassion and tolerance to good old-fashioned animated character  assassination (Kathie Lee Gifford in \"Weight Gain 4000\" and Barbra Streisand in  \"Mecha-Streisand\"). Like an After School Special gone quite mad,  profanity-spewing third-graders Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and the ill-fated Kenny navigate  childhood in their mountain town. Nothing inSouth Parkis sacred, and  each episode has something to offend, from \"Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride\"  (featuring George Clooney as the voice of Sparky, the homosexual dog), to the  Halloween episode \"Pink Eye,\" in which Cartman dresses up as Adolph Hitler. Best  not to even get started on Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Pooh, or the season finale  cliffhanger, \"Cartman's Mom Is a Dirty Slut.\"Each episode is preceded by a faux introduction by creators Trey Parker and Matt  Stone, who proclaim every episode to be their favorite. Their incarnations as  Rootin'-Tootin' Trey Parker and Pistol-Slingin' Matt Stone indicate that afterSouth Parkruns its course, they'd be great hosts of their own children's  show, which--and this cannot be stressed strongly enough--South Parkisnot. Other extras include theSouth Parkboys' appearance on the  CableAce awards and \"A South Park Thanksgiving,\" featuring Jay Leno, which aired  exclusively onThe Tonight Show. A minor annoyance is the slapdash  packaging that mislabels the episodes (\"Damien,\" for example, is on disc 3, not  2 as indicated).--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00023P49M", "B0000CABL2", "B0001ZWLVU", "B0006Z2L2Y", "B000ADWCYY", "B000CNESM6", "B000FSME2Y", "B000KLQUMQ", "B000R7I3XC", "B0018O5WUU", "B001O0TWXG", "B004MLEYTG", "B006W93ELK", "B0030Y11UG", "B009SQ9Q5M", "B000022TSW", "B00105308I", "B000USUA8E", "B00AEBB8TM", "B001O0TWXQ", "B004MLEYT6", "B006W93EM4", "B000ZT0S9O", "B0030Y11NS", "B009SQ9Y7M", "0762435704", "B000AQ68Z0", "B000083C6V", "B000OPO0LQ", "B008412UKA", "B007KFZ85K", "B000E6ES9O", "B00008YGRV", "B0001MZ7KA", "B0000AQS81", "0762435615", "B001CQONKO", "B003VJTGKW", "B007KFZ7YM", "B007KFZ88M", "B000HT3P6U", "B006IOAHTQ", "B001VFM0ZG", "B0012018OE", "B002CNKLTS", "B000RO6JZO", "B000H2M2R0", "B000UAE7UE", "B00G4RCF60", "B00005JM3G", "B00CJEKA2I", "B000NNK4DM", "B00008YGRS", "B007KFZ7UQ", "B002CNKTCW", "B006IOAHPK", "B009WSJHD2", "030789682X", "B000P2A6CA", "B00CJEK7GW", "B007KFZ8AA", "B00000J8BV", "B003DZX46G", "B000B5XOWU", "B003XJABTK", "B007ZFR67I", "B000ERVJNG", "B000B5XOR0", "B00C28X8IY", "0762438231", "B000ABKHZC", "B0028PO5R4", "B0002NY8XA", "B0024FAR52", "B003L77G7Y", "B0007CILMA", "B005QIOJ3A", "B001GQ3GHG", "B00008YGRZ", "B0012KSUTA", "B00L9K2EGS", "B00000I1BB", "B00AEFZ8OY", "B009TGW9S2", "B000KWZ1PC", "B001DZOD7C", "B007KFZ87S", "B00FEQ6IG0", "B000AQ68VO", "B0009VBTP0", "B00330WP6Q", "B001L1S1PI", "B008412UQ4", "B000GETTKM", "B003KZ27N0", "B000F9T700", "B0007PAM06", "B0006HBZEW", "B00CJEK8WA", "B00363WGB4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B009SQ9Q5M", "B0001ZWLVU", "B0000CABL2", "B00023P49M"]}, "price": 1.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 133903}, "asin": "B00006FDCR", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41GVGPYDDZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "South Park - The Complete First Season"}

So everyone worries: what will become of Toula? Then one day she sees the ultimate unattainable guy and realizes the only way her life will get better is if he gets away from her big, fat Greek family. Toula escapes from the family restaurant. She exchanges her seating hostess jacket for a college diploma, convinces her aunt to give her a new job, and trades in her coke-bottle glasses for contact lenses, just in time for \"him\" to walk back into her life. Ian Miller is tall, handsome but defnitely not Greek. Their courtship is an Olympian culture clash. Can Ian handle Toula, her parents, her aunts, uncles, cousins and several centuries of Greek heritage? Will Toula discover the love she's been missing right in the heart of her big, fat family? One thing is for sure, for better or worse, for richer or poorer, with Ian's proposal Toula is headed for her big, fat Greek wedding.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0021L8UO4", "B000EHRVOW", "B00386EZKE", "B000ELJAEM", "B0013D8LHC", "B00003CXSM", "B00AEBB8NS", "6304765266", "B0000CGNEF", "B00466HN7M", "B00005JG6N", "B000BKVQS4", "B0007RT9M6", "B0009OL7Z4", "B0038N9X3Q", "6305236569", "B002ZG988M", "B001AKTZW8", "B00006ZXSL", "B000YDBPAM", "B0015I2RT8", "B001TUZD8O", "B0000AOV4I", "B00AEBB8YW", "B000MQC9H4", "B00007E2F5", "B002ZG989G", "B0001AVZA8", "B0000897EG", "B00AEFXYOA", "B004SIP9RO", "B0007PLLBU", "B000OCZA04", "B00008NRI7", "B001GKJ2DY", "B002K0WBXW", "B00008G7UF", "B008R65XMO", "B000A343RI", "B001ECDVK4", "B0000VD02Y", "B000023VTP", "B001Y8DJVE", "B002ZG9968", "B003BV8ICC", "B0001XALGY", "B003B3V0N4", "B00006ZXSO", "B00006ZXSK", "B002U4UYZA", "B002U1LGTQ", "B00005JN3W", "B003Y5H524", "B000GETTIE", "B000J103OI", "B00DW5IJR6", "B00003CXC3", "B00AEFY99O", "B00AEBBA2M", "B001LMAK9W", "B0042816YK", "B006VRRGQ2", "B000JU8H9C", "B004IK30PA", "B00AEFXO8Q", "B005LAIGXW", "B0000B1OFL", "B00158K0QU", "B004SIP9VA", "B00006ZXSQ", "6305428352", "B005Z9MFRC", "B000K7VHTQ", "B000Z8GZYW", "B00AEFY5TI", "0767810856", "B0001I55M4", "B004SIP8LG", "B000FOPPC4", "B000E6EHE0", "B00005JPSM", "0800177258", "6305428387", "6305803781", "B004EPZ070", "0800141849"], "bought_together": ["B00386EZKE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00386EZKE", "B00466HN7M", "B0021L8UO4", "B0009OL7Z4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 2192}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.99, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00006FMUW", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51EhfedTTUL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "My Big Fat Greek Wedding"}
{"description": "Not the Steven Spielberg blockbuster, thisLost Worldis a splendid 2001 BBC TV dramatization of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's famousadventure story. Bob Hoskins makes an unusually genial Professor Challenger, far less of a bully than Doyle's character, but his slightly stereotyped companions are nicely filled out by a solid cast. James Fox is Challenger's more timid but still covertly adventurous rival, Tom Ward is the mustachioed big-game hunter who faces an allosaur with an elephant gun, and Matthew Rhys plays the tagalong reporter hoping to impress his faithless fianc&#xE9;e.As usual, the adaptation adds a woman--orphaned jungle girl Elaine Cassidy--to the expedition, and an interesting villain (religious fanatic Peter Falk) beefs up the travelogue by marooning Challenger's gang on the South American plateau where dinosaurs, cavemen, and Indians coexist eventfully. TheWalking with Dinosaurs-style effects work well for the TV frame, but the real success is in integrating the adventuring with subtle eco-awareness, complex character interplay, and the reliable wonder of soaring pteranodons and carnosaur attacks.--Kim Newman", "related": {"also_bought": ["B008L0YMVE", "B000SAGGL4", "B001BGS17Q", "B00007JMD8", "B001V7P2X6", "B0016MJ6HE", "B000KP62F2", "0486400603", "B00005JKU0", "B005PF9KD8", "1848511973"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B008L0YMVE", "B0000E69H6", "B000SAGGL4", "B0001I2CFC"]}, "price": 5.0, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 121414}, "asin": "B00006JDQP", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51269DWPFEL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Lost World"}

{"description": "David Weaver makes his feature debut with this omnibus film in which each tale is told during different points during the 20th century, but in the same hotel room -- room 720. The film opens during the swinging '20s when a beautiful young woman, married against her will to a brutish thug of a man, endures a tension-fraught honeymoon. During the Depression segment, a mail-order bride from China meets her husband for the first time. Following the end of WWII, a soldier returns home to meet his girlfriend and his best friend. During the paranoia of the 1950s, a professor searches for his wife. During the 1980s, a lawyer has too much sex and debt, and during the dawn of the millennium, a woman comes to a newly refurbished room 720 to meet her Internet lover. Such acclaimed Canadian actors as Tom McCamus, Sandrine Holt, and Colm Feore star in this film, which was screened at the 2001 Toronto Film Festival.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001AIQ14A", "B00GRZPRB4", "B00J4LMHMK", "B000VTHYAE", "B00EMAGKNU", "B000096I9C", "B00E8G5H8W", "B00008AOU2", "B000AQ69LS", "B006M3M5FM", "B000BTIU4S", "B001UDS4BS", "B000MX7TXQ", "B00ET2ODU8", "B00275EGNS", "B00000F5WY", "B00EMAGK1W", "B0001932ZU", "B008NA3I30", "B000BF0D92", "B000UAE7J0", "B000AQKV1W", "B000083C83", "B0052SO0J2", "B0091D48KK", "B004HHX9OQ", "B006ISJQ1W", "6305428107", "B0002IQKS6", "B0000YEE6C", "B000T9OP7G", "B00180OU7K", "B003CP1SW4", "6305976333", "B007AFC0RY", "B00366BBTE", "B0002KPIQY", "B00005QJIG", "B0040J1RX6", "B000PKG8TM", "B00003CXLD", "B000FIHN5M", "B001CC7PRQ", "B000SAAT76", "B000Z8H13Q", "B001O3W73A", "B00003M5G0", "6305337373", "6305908087", "B000LPS2OU", "B00008DDS9", "B00004TX5U", "B00005AVZS", "B000BDGWI0", "B001662FK0", "B001RTKKSA", "B00005421W", "B0000633R7", "B00004RF2Q", "B008I34ZLQ", "B004SEUJ00", "B000BVNS8O", "B00009XN8S", "B0000694ZK", "B005HP2J70", "B0000ALQCS", "B0015S2OXM", "B000BBOFBS", "B002UPQ228", "B00005BJW9"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00008AOU2"]}, "price": 29.95, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 318929}, "asin": "B00006JMSI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51nW77ayZDL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Century Hotel"}
{"description": "The Monterey International Pop Festival, the three-day event staged in 1967 that has become one of rock music's most famous and in some ways greatest concerts, gets the royal treatment with this three-disc boxed set.Material on two of the three discs has already been widely available.Monterey Pop, D.A. Pennebaker's 79-minute, 1968 film, effectively sets the scene for the festival, which took place during the fabled \"Summer of Love,\" when the hippie ethos was in its fullest flower, especially on the West Coast. And while not all the featured performances are thrilling, those that are--principally by the Who, Jimi Hendrix, and the amazing Ravi Shankar--are worth the price of admission, especially in the high-definition digital transfer and new 5.1 mix seen and heard here. The same can be said forJimi Plays MontereyandShake! Otis at Monterey, which appear in the boxed set on a separate disc and provide a much fuller look at Hendrix's and Otis Redding's incendiary sets (literally, in the former case).Those two discs are also loaded with bonus features, including audio commentary by Pennebaker, festival producer Lou Adler (onMonterey Pop), and author Peter Guralnick (Shake!); audio-only remarks by some of the performers; photos; trailers; and other material. There's also a substantial booklet, filled with essays and photos. But it's the third disc, \"The Outtake Performances,\" comprising some two hours of music that didn't make the final film edit, that will be of most interest to many viewers. The disc supplies a taste of some of the artists who didn't appear inMonterey Popat all (the Byrds, Buffalo Springfield, Quicksilver Messenger Service), and a more complete look at some who did (the Who, Simon and Garfunkel, the Mamas and the Papas). A nice addition to an already very impressive DVD collection.--Sam Graham", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001NXDSLQ", "B00004YZFR", "B003NOGNX8", "1573306932", "B00DSNITGI", "B001FWRZ14", "B0002WZTJI", "B0009PBLZE", "B001TLWR46", "B000305ZDO", "B00KF1CWF0", "B0090O07S2", "B00003CXB1", "B004AXJA0Y", "B001CRRADU", "B00IPL286U", "B000B8IANU", "B00HQI823Q", "B000621484", "B0009E3234", "B005HS00U0", "B000E5LEWE", "B000AYQJ3I", "B0002CTSXQ", "B0030ATZIA", "B00F031WB8", "B00H7MW2IM", "B000UB054U", "B00JZO33VK", "B008PALH1I", "B000PFU9RO", "B000VLOKQI", "B001NHZ2KM", "B000VI6T6U", "B00H3JHH6Q", "B0084NZEWO", "B000W1V5TM", "B00FLDG52I", "6305019681", "B00KCUGSTA", "B0012GMUR2", "0783233485", "B00F031X62", "B002BEXF9G", "B00BDQWBH0", "0060755229", "B000021Y7X", "B00HQI83RQ", "B002CSC5EC", "B00274SHKM", "B001DWNUF6", "B0029LD2QW", "0991252527", "B001L7S0F8", "B00023B19Y", "B005OGYH9A", "B000BC8SVA", "B0000DBJDM", "1595800603", "B000NTPFNA", "B000002UTX", "B0018M6J7C", "B003H5WF3U", "B000KJU1HI", "B000AM6N9U", "B00IVLRB2U", "B00H9GJSR4", "B000PSJDQ4", "B009186JYI", "B000002UTY", "B0000CEB4V", "B00104AZ3M", "B004QGYKX2", "B008NR92SI", "B00008GKEG", "B00BHWG5C2", "B00FCFX6OU", "B0012GN404", "B0034BBB2S", "B0000E6FOM", "B0002GTX8C", "B00003OSU4", "B008B3MZMY", "B0034BBB32", "B005HI4LLO", "B00006673L", "B00HEM1ORA", "B00018D2X8", "B00IK7NC9G", "B00CIOFWE0", "B00G2DC2EG", "B0055IU3GI", "B008CJ0JS4", "B003W77U88", "B00JROMHM4", "B003W5C0VW", "B0009MAPX6", "B0009WFFS6", "B00000K2VU"], "bought_together": ["B001NXDSLQ", "B00004YZFR"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001NXDSLQ", "B000E5LEWE", "B00J2PQYYK", "B00DSNITGI"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 43373}, "categories": [["CDs & Vinyl", "Rock"], ["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 47.95, "brand": "Unknown", "asin": "B00006JU7P", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51lgm6vwcgL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Complete Monterey Pop Festival (The Criterion Collection)"}

You get a slasher film in which the victims are not screaming, scantily clad teens, but parka-clad cops. Whether that's an improvement on the genre is open for debate. WithEye See You(which never hit U.S. theaters but was released internationally asD-Tox), Stallone's career has officially \"Van-Dammed.\" But the role of FBI special agent Jake Malloy is something of a dramatic departure. Unable to catch a cop killer before he nastily dispatches his girlfriend (wouldn't you know; right before Jake was about to propose!), Jake takes to the bottle. He enters a snowbound rehab center for cops housed in the Wyoming mountains. The demons Jake must confront are not just psychological. A killer is stalking the residents one by one. Shallow characterizations and ham-fisted dialogue are good for armchair heckling, but for Stallone fans, this will be of interest as even more of a career curiosity thanStop!

{"description": "In 1966-67, with 100,000 meters of black-and-white film and freedom to shoot without a script, director Vilgot Sj&#xF6;man created a motion picture so rangy and multilayered that it became two separate, overlapping movies released a year apart:I Am Curious YellowandI Am Curious Blue.  Those are the colors of the Swedish flag, and   Sj&#xF6;man's film tapped into the political, social, and psychosexual condition of his nation on the eve of worldwide cultural revolution.It also became a envelope-pushing event in the history of sex in the cinema.  A feisty, rather zaftig actress-activist named Lena Nyman played a radical activist named Lena Nyman who, in between interviewing her fellow Swedes about everything from gender inequities to the morality of vacationing in Franco's Spain, spent lots of raunchy time in bed (and elsewhere).  The copious frontal nudity and a glimpse of oral-genital contact ensured an epic court battle in America, andI Am Curious Yellowbecame a must-see conversation piece.Decades later, it all seems not only fresher than it did then but oddly tender, even sweet.  Sj&#xF6;man, 42 years old to Nyman's 22, cast himself as her lover (which he was) as well as her director, and the film is occasionally \"interrupted\" by its own filming.  Sj&#xF6;man/\"Sj&#xF6;man\" has to watch Lena/\"Lena\" doing some very intimate things with costar B&#xF6;rje Ahlstedt.  B&#xF6;rje is playing a car salesman, but also playing \"himself\" as an actor sometimes intriguing against his director with \"Lena\"--not \"Lena the activist\" but \"Lena the actress,\" both of whom Lena the actress-for-real is playing.  The Pirandellianism is witty, raw, and lingeringly ambiguous.  And now DVD adds another layer if you happen to watch with the commentary track engaged and listen to the seventysomething Sj&#xF6;man, still musing wryly on the radical fusion of film and life at whose creation he was present.--Richard T.

Conceived as a primetime satire of daytime melodramas, this groundbreaking series toppled many of the TV taboos that remained afterAll in the FamilyandM*A*S*H, openly addressing a variety of risky topics (homosexuality, infidelity, impotence, familial murder) with a deft combination of irreverent wit, wacky slapstick, supreme stupidity, and--key to its success--engaging drama from characters you could really care about, regardless of their rampant quirks and foibles.As a friendly announcer informs us, \"this is the story of two sisters\" in suburban Connecticut--wealthy dimwit Jessica Tate (Katherine Helmond) and blue-collar housewife Mary Campbell (Cathryn Damon)--whose class-divided families are bound by enough scandalous secrets to make each of these 25 episodes (all written by creator-producer Susan Harris and directed by sitcom veteran Jay Sandrich) a polished gem of half-hour comedy. The integration of plot and character is flawless, and dirty laundry was rarely this absurd: Jessica's cheating on her cheating husband (Robert Mandan, the show's underrated lynchpin); stepson Jodie (Billy Crystal) is (gasp!) openly gay, and brother Danny (Ted Wass) has Mafia connections; daughter Corrine (Diana Canova) is in love with a priest; Mary's husband Burt (manic genius Richard Mulligan) is a would-be killer who thinks he's invisible; and all of them are suspects in a murder case that fuels the season's cliffhanger finale.This is ensemble comedy at its finest, and is it any wonder Robert Guillaume--as the Tates' insolent servant Benson--got his own spin-off sitcom in 1979? His line readings (such as \"You wantmeto get that?\" when the doorbell rings) are instant classics, and while Helmond tops the cast with her inimitable brand of idiocy, there's not a weak link in the entire cast. All those protesting prudes fought a futile battle:Soapwas never naughty without purpose (indeed, the show possesses subtle integrity) and a large and loyal audience propelled it to even crazier heights in subsequent seasons. (Technical note: Given the shortcomings of 25-year-old videotape, with minor glitches and color variations, these episodes look and sound remarkably good.)--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00361XWF0", "B00361XWFA", "B00361XWFK", "B000Q6GUJS", "B000MEYKA0", "B00008EY6N", "B0002NY8R6", "B0006N2EZK", "B001OXLGK0", "B000YKYT1M", "B00LMKKY2Q", "B000MXPE6U", "B002PQ7JR4", "B0006N2EZA", "B0006Q93BU", "B000YGGNGK", "B0001NBNIY", "B000MGTQ6G", "B00ESZZOM2", "B0007Y08JW", "B0002RQ3MU", "B000FTC1GW", "B0025KVNOU", "B004J713KQ", "B0000DFZ5O", "B000A9QKSM", "B00HNGC56G", "B00005JLIC", "B000A0GOP0", "B000EQ46HI", "B00EQ2KU7G", "B00FM4S7P4", "B000ATQYWY", "B00005JLIB", "B000MGBSH6", "B0006IUDYY", "B000A0GXGK", "B00008EYBH", "B00IFK7ONI", "B005BUA1JY", "B00005JNHU", "B00HRUQB5O", "B0016MJ73M", "B00005JOXR", "B0002I837M", "B00GLT2SOA", "B000JLQPYK", "B000ASDFIG", "B0000E32X2", "B000FFJ8BM", "B00004RE45", "B002WQ799U", "B000CNE0SS", "B000KB4898", "B000TGURZ8", "B00005AWQV", "B000GTLB6C", "B000E1MXWI", "B00008WJEZ", "B00008NV4G", "B0009X7BF0", "1593936877", "B0009ML1Z2", "B00A33J8FM", "B00GOC74QG", "B0058EE6NK", "B00D2UMHB0", "B00005JO3P", "B001D2WUDE", "B00005JNHT", "B00441GYXS", "B001HUHBC2", "B0025VKX04", "B000LC4Z8K", "B000N6UF10", "B000068V9Y", "B0001907BW", "B00DJYK1XU", "B001O4KBNM", "B000FVQLIO", "B00BM2JVAA", "B00E1HIWXU", "B0017W22LK", "B00CPEK3OM", "B001LRL4Y2", "B0009X7BEG", "B00006J6XH", "B00006J6XI", "B001OXLGIM", "B0002PYTD2", "B0002MK61E", "B003JHXS5A", "B00005U2KS", "B0055CP9P4", "B003INBNV6", "B000G6BLY2", "B000R7I3YG", "B005ZVIMUE", "B000UX6TLG", "B00008PHCZ"], "bought_together": ["B00361XWF0", "B00361XWFA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00361XWFA", "B00361XWFK", "B0016MJ73M", "B00361XWF0"]}, "price": 19.88, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 79039}, "asin": "B00008EY5S", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51PWYDTTVXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Soap - The Complete First Season"}
{"description": "Since winning an Academy Award for his exuberant performance inJerry Maguire, Cuba Gooding Jr. has gotten little but static from critics for a spate of calamitous career choices not seen since '80s-vintage Burt Reynolds. But he triumphantly returns to Oscar-worthy status with his moving performance as Radio, a mentally challenged young man, whom South Carolina high school football coach Harold Jones (Ed Harris) takes under his nurturing wing. This does not play well with the school's patient but questioning principal (Alfre Woodard); the school's biggest athletic booster, who views Radio as a distraction; the man's son, the team's star player, who plays cruel pranks on the trusting Radio; and the Coach's teenage daughter, who feels neglected. Almost all will be won over by Radio's trusting and good nature. Based on aSports Illustratedstory,Radiowas adapted for the screen by Mike Rich, screenwriter ofThe Rookie, and as in that superior family film, the heroics are mostly off the field. As Coach says, with all the subtlety of a blitz, \"We're not the ones been teaching Radio; he's the one been teaching us.\" The ending, in which we see the actual Radio, still cheering his team on 26 years later, will melt the most cynical hearts.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JPBO", "B002VECM6S", "B000056VP4", "B000066HAS", "B00004W221", "B000J3OTT6", "B000EXZFCQ", "0792843592", "6305531293", "B00AEFXOKO", "B000068NNU", "B001LGXIA6", "B002NZK5UK", "0788815466", "B000KHYN9C", "6305428352", "B0001US66Y", "B000N6U0E2", "B00000IQV7", "B00004TJQJ", "B002D755AI", "B00125WAWS", "B0006FYOTC", "B00AEBB9F0", "B00005JNEW", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00KPYT9PS", "B000FVQLQQ", "B000KLQUS0", "B0068FZ0GK", "B000Q7ZNZ4", "B002VWNIBI", "B000K2UGZM", "B001FB55NK", "B004KPLVX6", "B00722MQE2", "B0026S2TU8", "B004DK5CW4", "B0001ADAVK", "630542845X", "B00005JKWX", "B000CDSS18", "B0000YTP02", "B00006HAWN", "B00AEFZ63M", "6305133468", "B00AEFXOE0", "B009NNM9OA", "B000MNOX94", "B000PHVZNE", "B00AEFY17E", "B000G1R394", "B001QB5SS6", "B005OZVXCU", "B000FVR1T2", "B0000AM6NV", "B002YMWQ2M", "B002VWNICM", "B0023UZBBI", "B009YQJ2Q4", "B00005JMCN", "B0026JI1R2", "B0002TSZI8", "B000KF0GWW", "078324021X", "6305428387", "B0038M2AZA", "B008FCX2D2", "B000QQLVPQ", "0767836359", "0783225733", "B000X5RBXG", "B004SEUJOQ", "B00KD5HFJG", "B00AMEZDJW", "B00AEFXV3E", "B000RBA6C4", "B00AEFXY6I", "0767802497", "B000FFJYB6", "B000274T94", "B0000648ZR", "B00133KFGW"], "bought_together": ["B002VECM6S", "B000056VP4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000X5RBXG", "B000056VP4", "B000J3OTT6", "B00005JPBO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 13680}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.95, "brand": "Team Marketing", "asin": "B00008EY60", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510370Y4VYL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Radio"}

{"description": "Jack Bauer is having another one of his \"very bad days\" in the second season of the groundbreaking real-time thriller24. Once again the hours are ticking by with more guaranteed cliffhangers than a convention of mountain climbers. Holed up in a Los Angeles condo and estranged from his daughter, Jack is no longer on the government payroll; unfortunately for him, this small fact doesn't seem to matter to President David Palmer and the NSA, who call him back in to the CTU and give him 24 hours to infiltrate a terrorist organization that is planning to detonate a dirty bomb in the city of angels. All Jack wants is to get his daughter out of the city, unfortunately Kim's new employer, the abusive father of the child she is nannying, has other ideas.Fans of theoriginalwon't be disappointed, as there are more than enough shock moments in the first few hours to hint at the climactic build-up to come, while newcomers can quickly get involved in the lives of Jack and his family. There are some new characters to bolster the veteran cast and, interestingly (although not surprisingly), Jack's character has taken an altogether darker, more psychopathic turn. The danger the characters find themselves in also has a much more global, not to mention topical, impetus, grounded as it is in the war against terrorism.  Although the territory is more familiar this time around, this second season is just as much a high-tension, taut, adrenalin-fuelled ride as the first, and one that will have you glued to your TV for the next 24 hours.--Kristen Bowditch", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0002XVQSU", "B000NDEXK2", "B000B837XI", "B000ICLRKC", "B000NDEXKW", "B000MR8W92", "B001L5SRJE", "B002ZCY7SW", "B001DMVZOE", "B0015QWZ8S", "B002ZCY7TG", "0756632277", "B0001WHXM0", "B00G4RCXPI", "B00KPP6ZLS", "B0000DIJNU", "B000FIMG68", "B000AJJNFE", "B00005JNOG", "B00BC5I6Q2", "B001OQCVFG", "B002N5N5QQ", "B00HT850YW", "B003FSTN52", "B000Q6GUW0", "B0049P1VHS", "B00ECHBSP8", "B004UXVDJA", "B0058YPJ2W", "B00J5LXT44", "B0044E9JU0", "B001GCUER0", "B00IWTVDUW", "B002ZCY8CC", "B0058YPGSY", "B0019L21GA", "B003L77GK6", "B00GTZWZH6", "B00HEPE6MM", "B0024FAR5M", "B00KPP6R9S", "B00005JOC9", "B004EXWGHY", "B00AIBZMD6", "B009LDD1H6", "B000P6YNSE", "B000EWBNMI", "B00ITAQ2T6", "B001AI776G", "B0036EH3XE", "B0089AD8IO", "B000YABIQ6", "B00FGEO9NE", "B00HLTD3ZW", "B009LDCZ7I", "B00IKM5LXG", "B000HEVZ9E", "B003F3NDWG", "B00AB65RUG", "B00HF98SJY", "B000BF0C8E", "B000BGR1B4", "B00E8OMZGG", "B00JA3RVG4"], "bought_together": ["B000NDEXK2", "B0002XVQSU"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000NDEXK2", "B000ICLRKC", "B0002XVQSU", "B000MR8W92"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 4639}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 39.69, "brand": "20th Century Fox", "asin": "B00008YGRU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516918NBNNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "24: Season 2"}

When Kagome interferes, Kikyo learns of  Naraku's treachery and the real cause of her death.

He blames Inu-Yasha, hoping Sango will  kill him.

But this is only the beginning of a series of  uprootings, and as the surface of their lives is torn away, Walter and  Jettel find they have little in common, and must--under tumultuous  circumstances--build their marriage anew. With incredible skill and  passion,Nowhere in Africamanages to bring you fully into every  change in this family's life; it richly deserves the Academy Award&#xAE; it  received in 2002. A powerful, deeply moving film.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000274THQ", "B000021Y77", "B0012QE4PI", "B000OVLBGC", "B00004TX5J", "B000YKT4BW", "B00008978K", "B0006IIKRQ", "B002BWP4A6", "B0030Y1282", "B0001US47U", "B0009RCPUC", "0767802470", "B000H5V8H2", "B004XVMCG2", "B000060MUZ", "B00005OLBC", "B000065V3C", "B0036TGSJE", "B00007KQ9X", "B000NVT0RU", "B00005U8EN", "B000I6BJ56", "B005HP2IYE", "B005M9VSNC", "B002KECJZ8", "B0087OULO6", "B00007KK52", "B00005JLR8", "B0009VND0E", "B00007ELFA", "B00080Z53O", "B0070YPWAW", "B000TGCR38", "B000C65Z1G", "B00HNFSD5Y", "B0016C1QIQ", "B002W1HBM0", "B001DB6J82", "B00006JU6Y", "B0081HLM2E", "B0037A4ILC", "B003PMWF62", "B000R7G9II", "B00ID8HATK", "0783240171", "B006TTC540", "B000NA6CQ8", "6302020816", "B00F6SHGF8", "B00ID8H8EW", "B004XVMCLC", "B0006SJ3IQ", "B0028YW3CE", "B00BSTVGHS", "0299199649", "B000056KMW", "B00005QFE6", "B0045ZAQSM", "B000087EY5", "B000OCY7JE", "B000I0RNV6", "B0016BCYFQ", "B002SF9YNO", "B001D1F8N4", "B000BPL2F6", "B009XTF8NI", "B000VWYJ6S", "B002AG2NTI", "B001MYIXAC", "B000GIXE86", "B002BWP3UC", "6305972761", "B00772HQTC", "B007UI0CIA", "B000FC2FX8", "B001F0TM2Q", "B004UC0E46", "B000N3T0DW", "B00005JLD4", "B00EVU3RGE", "B00EO2I6QK", "B00DHN8G58", "0783233523", "B001DGFGOU", "B00006G8G3", "B002U4F5W2", "B00DJYJOPG", "B00AIBZLHS", "B00006LPHK", "B000GRU8TK", "B007WXUVHU", "B00AZMFM9C", "B0000931R8", "B004NTXH7C", "0300109504", "B002U1LGSW", "B00ARX2VZW", "B0095ZIHZ6", "B000BP3ATW"], "bought_together": ["B000274THQ", "B000021Y77"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000274THQ", "0783240171", "0299199649", "B00004TX5J"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 44228}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 38.29, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B0000AUHQG", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51WW4Z31Z6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Nowhere in Africa"}
{"description": "Originally calledSex Crimes, executive producer Dick Wolf wisely opted for something less lurid when the second in the inexhaustibleLaw &amp; Orderfranchise hit the air in 1999. Still, as the opening voiceover makes clear, the \"sexually based offenses\" investigated by New York's Special Victims Unitcanbe \"especially heinous.\" This six-DVD boxed set includes all 22 episodes of the first compelling season.Wolf penned series premier \"Payback,\" which sets the scene, but not the tone. It's a lively, if uneasy mix between horror (rape) and comedy (risqu&eacute; banter). As the show progressed, humor would be written out altogether (leaving Richard Belzer'sHomicide-derived John Munch with increasingly less to do). Less emphasis would also be placed on the home lives of this \"elite squad of dedicated detectives.\" Mostly, \"Payback\" introduces us to the unit, centering around partners Olivia Benson (Mariska Hargitay) and Elliot Stabler (Christopher Meloni). For two people with so little in common, they make a terrific team--arguably one of TV's best. Stabler is married with four children; Benton is single and her closest relationship is with her mother (Elizabeth Ashley). While Stabler can get a little rough with suspects, Benton tends to over-empathize with the victims. They report to the no-nonsense Captain Cragen (Law &amp; Ordervet Dann Florek). Like the parent program's Lenny Briscoe, he's a recovering alcoholic. Dean Winters and Michelle Hurd round out the rock-solid cast.As it would continue to do in successive years,SVU's first season proved that network TV could explore sex crimes without being salacious or exploitative. \"Uncivilized,\" for instance, concerns a child murder that is automatically pinned on a local sex offender, when the actual perpetrator isn't quite so obvious. \"Disrobed,\" in which Brian Cassidy (Winters) leaves the department and Benson (with whom he had a brief affair) shoots a suspect is another standout in a strong year.SVUwas followed byCriminal Intentin 2001 and features several guest appearances from Jerry Orbach (Briscoe) and Angie Harmon (Abbie Carmichael) from the originalLaw &amp; Order.--Kathleen C.

{"description": "Crime cinema has never been so meticulously and coolly executed. Taciturn thief Alain Delon (intense and dapper in trenchcoat and fedora) and escaped prisoner Gian Maria Volonte cross paths as if by fate, bound by saving each other's life, and join with disgraced ex-cop Yves Montand for their next job: a daring jewel robbery.Le Cercle Rougeis the ultimate expression of the romantic doom that Jean-Pierre Melville established in his masterpiecesBob Le FlambeurandLe Samourai. The centerpiece heist, a wordless 20-minute sequence with masked men communicating in codified gestures, is a tour de force of cinematic efficiency that tops evenRififiin its celebration of criminal skill and nerve. Melville's cool detachment doesn't allow us to really warm up to these uncompromising pros, but his cinematic precision is spellbinding and his unforgiving world of loyalty, professionalism, sacrifice, and codes of honor is an irresistible underworld fantasy.The Criterion DVD restores the film, which was originally  cut by 40 minutes for its American release, to its full-length director's cut. Additionally, it features new interviews with Melville's assistant director Bernard Stora and friend and expert Rui Nogueira, rare archival interviews with the director and his cast, and a new introduction by filmmaker and Melville fan John Woo among its wealth of supplements.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000AQKUG8", "B000NOK0HG", "B001CW7ZSA", "B001CW7ZSU", "B00005A8TX", "B004WPYO7E", "B00192QJQC", "B0000633SC", "B000025RE7", "B000E5LEVA", "B001BEK8C4", "B0011U3OA6", "B00007ELDG", "B00005NFZA", "B00005BHW6", "0780021541", "B009D004TA", "B00005QAPJ", "B0007SMDCS", "B000PKG6OY", "B00007CVS3", "B00005JKPT", "B0007989Y8", "B000BC8SWO", "B008CJ0JS4", "B00180R072", "B0009XRZME", "B00014K5Y6", "B00AQ6J5YA", "B00005B1ZK", "B00005QAPH", "B004NWPY3E", "B000059PPK", "B001LMU1C8", "0780020707", "B0012E2F5G", "B002FKCAVU", "B00005A8TV", "B0016B6ZEC", "B004M66YUS", "B000M2E3GI", "B00008RH15", "B00092ZLEY", "B001LMU19G", "B0002DB4YQ", "B00HVOFP62", "B00005NC66", "B0006HC0I2", "B0047P5FSQ", "B0012KOM6K", "B00K5EJHGO", "B005KQVE1S", "B000G8NXZ0", "B0001UZZSG", "B00005AUK9", "B000AQKUH2", "B004ALIG4M", "0792838947", "B0009298N4", "B00000IOKV", "B000035P5Y", "B001GCATWK", "B000N3SROA", "B000244EWO", "B004ALIG1U", "B000I8OOG0", "B0006Z2NE0", "0851709494", "B0007MANYY", "B000305ZYS", "B00005JLV7", "B00005V6N6", "B002U6DVQ2", "B00AQ6J6H6", "B000093NQZ", "B00GPPXP6A", "B00008H2GS", "B000093NR0", "B00012L786", "B001CW7ZT4", "B00DZP1C3Q", "B00A1TATYM", "B0001A67AQ", "B00007CVS2", "078002205X", "B00005A8TU", "B00HVOFP12", "B00199PPB0", "B0007ZEOC8", "B002AFX53C", "B000VARC32", "B000MTEFOQ", "B000065V38", "6305257450", "B001PYD0M0", "B000ZM1MIM", "B006XN0IWI", "6305744114", "B0001ZIYDO", "B000CNE088"], "bought_together": ["B000AQKUG8", "B001CW7ZSU"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004WPYO7E", "B0047P5FSQ", "B000AQKUG8", "B000G8NXZ0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 97308}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 66.98, "brand": "Image Entertainment", "asin": "B0000BUZKP", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51UM4ZNdoXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Le Cercle Rouge (The Criterion Collection)"}

{"description": "For earthbound humans,Winged Migrationis as close as any of us will get to sharing the sky with our fine feathered friends. It's as if French director Jacques Perrin and his international crew of dedicated filmmakers had been given a full-access pass by Mother Nature herself, with the complete \"cooperation\" of countless species of migrating birds, all answering to eons of migratory instinct. The film is utterly simple in purpose, with minimal narration and on-screen titles to identify the wondrous varieties of flying wildlife, but its visceral effect is humbling, awesome and magnificently profound. Technically, Perrin surpasses the achievement of his earlier filmMicrocosmos(which did for insects what this film does for birds), and apart from a few digital skyscapes for poetic effect, this astonishing film uses no special effects whatsoever, with soaring, seemingly miraculous camera work that blesses the viewer with, quite literally, a bird's-eye view. A brief but important hunting scene may upset sensitive viewers and children, but doesn't stopWinged Migrationfrom being essential all-ages viewing.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B007C8RZWO", "B00GSDSQDQ", "B000BI5KV0", "B0000DZ3BS", "B009VRVGLK", "B005OAEWV4", "B004LWZWBU", "B000069HXL", "B0037X5BME", "B000BB1534", "B009B0L4H8", "B004CRR9FG", "B0043SS2DC", "B001UV4XW4", "B009DJB95E", "B003QF1N7K", "B00AEFXFNA", "B0014VPFQI", "B00005LK94", "B004ISVGZI", "B008WAM2PG", "B00BQI3Y7Q", "B00CBLP2T0", "B001RV53TE", "B00AKIPA52", "B00BGDCX0A", "B00GSDSRQW", "B00443FMIY", "B001W79MRW", "B003QF1NA2", "B0002B54QC", "B0006U6KIU", "B000XCK0MS", "069101633X", "B003ONR2WE", "B002RB56W2", "B0028ERBSA", "B005SH65TK", "0865475911", "0688166490", "B008V8NR8U", "B00IAR2DJG", "079225483X", "B0016I0AH8", "B001957A4E", "B00KAPHV0C", "B00AQ8IXRI", "B0036TGSW6", "B002EWD0CW", "0375709665", "0618756426", "B0000CBXZX", "0802715184", "B00FRQ0BA6", "B002NTDXOQ", "B00CPTUOI2", "B000056OZ5", "B0009XRZS8", "B0012YN5AK", "B003XMKU2A", "B00559SGKC", "B004PHSTWK", "B000MR9D5E", "B007C8RZU6", "B008XJM7KG", "B0009K7R1Q", "B00BQI49VG", "B003QF1NAM", "0199328749", "0691154821", "B00JXVNVRG", "0754821668", "B00AEFY9RG", "0762731346", "B006US3UQC", "1886679002", "B000024HL1", "B009NRQTKQ", "B002ZG974M", "B000JU7JE6", "B000LPS2TA", "B00BCV3IN2", "B00020HAWE", "6304698623", "B00000IQBE", "B00000K3TX", "B00004TJJV", "B005R2SHQA", "B000EBD9W6", "B001CDLAT4"], "bought_together": ["B007C8RZWO", "B00GSDSQDQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00GSDSQDQ", "B007C8RZWO", "B00BGDCX0A", "B000069HXL"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 73172}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 18.99, "brand": "", "asin": "B0000CGNEH", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51FSQ6AH0QL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Winged Migration (Special Edition)"}

{"description": "Drama ruled in a big way on the third season ofQueer as Folk, as the gay men and women of Pittsburgh rode a roller coaster of emotional and personal upheavals that would make a regular soap-opera cast blanch. Budding comic book artist Justin (Randy Harrison) finally left longtime lover Brian for a chance at ecstasy--and not a bit of agony-&#x96;with a charming violin player. Emmett (Peter Paige) finally came face-to-face with his affection for friend Ted (Scott Lowell), only to have Ted's growing drug habit get in the way of their happiness. Lesbians Melanie (Michelle Clunie) and Lindsay (Thea Gill) decided to have another baby, whose father would be... Michael (Hal Sparks), whose nesting with hunky Ben (Robert Gant) is rudely interrupted by runaway Hunter (Harris Allan). And as for Brian (Gale Harold), the man everybody wants but can't ever have? Just when it seems he's gone to work for the enemy--a homophobic mayoral candidate-&#x96;it turns out he might be the savior the Pittsburgh gay community never knew it needed.Snaps to the makers ofQAFfor trying to bring their characters into the grown-up world &#x96; Michael, Emmett, and Ted started their own businesses; Justin finally cut loose from Brian-&#x96;but too many melodramatic plot twists and turns impeded a lot of the character development this show worked hard at during its first two seasons.

{"description": "Based on Brian Greene'sbook, this three-part Nova program should do for physics whatCosmosdid for astronomy. Greene hosts the program on the relative new concept of String Theory, a potential (and explosive) answer to the Holy Grail of science: a single, ultimate theory for everything. Part of Greene's (along with filmmakers Julia Cort and Joseph McMaster) genius is the ability to explain complex issues with ease thanks to a generous helping of graphics and humor. It starts with a perplexing anecdote: Einstein died trying to figure out if there could be an ultimate theory. His General Theory of Relativity brought order to the laws of large objects, but could not explain the chancier world of Quantum Mechanics (which deals with atomic particles). String Theory tries to marry the two. Greene and many colleagues give us a history of the quest and how String Theory was \"discovered\" in the 1980s. The formula has a lot of quirks, the most dazzling being the insistence there's 11 dimensions in the universe. Greene is not as natural asCosmoscreator/host Carl Sagan, but he is certainly friendly and encouraging (albeit it's quite odd for the host to be interviewed at various times in the program). Because it's a three-part show, there is some overlap at the start of hours 2 and 3.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0056031LE", "B004QSQMG8", "B0056031FA", "B000BKDO6G", "B0001WTWPG", "B008BJTQ0W", "B0047HXMMU", "B006WY0VRU", "B001IBCS3C", "B0015LPRPG", "B0002ABU2U", "B008IG0FEY", "B0047HXMKM", "B005F0TH2C", "B007IUEE8O", "B00FOLGW5C", "B003QWVPGW", "B000GIXLLG", "039333810X", "B000BKDNY4", "B0001WTULW", "B00652U6EW", "B000C8STO4", "B00465I1AG", "B00465I1A6", "B00BCV3IN2", "B004AR4WIK", "B00331RHEU", "B000BITUD4", "B0077PBPXM", "B00A3THVKK", "B005QW98IW", "B00IXPQUE4", "B004FOPFFC", "B000LP6KQW", "B000JJ5F8O", "B0028ERBSA", "B00IN69MWK", "B004XKVPLG", "B004D7SBMU", "B000MZGN54", "B00F1BFMBU", "B006QVRUY6", "B002XNEIIM", "B0001WTUM6", "0393058581", "B004HJ0ZMI", "0375727205", "0307278123", "B001JXPC1O", "B000XBPDYY", "B000055ZOB", "B000UP881S", "B00IWULQQ2", "B004K4FUWU", "B006QVRVYA", "B00IWULSTC", "B005KLOPLO", "B000VWZ0LG", "B00HNR3ZF0", "B007IUEDLW", "B0016OKQOO", "B00FNPQW7M", "0691156271", "B004XKVQVU", "B0031SZER2", "B003NF97OE", "B001N77YRG", "B000EOTENQ", "B005BYBZEK", "B00AK51Q8U", "B001D7T460", "0375412883", "B00IN69Q9O", "B004CYVZ18", "B001UW59JY", "B000C8STOE", "0307265633", "B001MYIQKO", "B001IBCS2S", "1400033721", "B007IUEDW6", "B004PYDN4M", "047046724X", "B0000648XV", "B00363WGHI", "B00AK51NJC", "B001J863EO", "B00BQI49VG", "B005JYNG9Y", "B00BCV3JKE", "B0030BS1FM", "B004D7SBLQ", "B009SYUUPO", "B00AK51OFK", "B005KLOPGY", "1886653364", "B000PY510K", "B0042EJDJ4", "B00BQI43E4"], "bought_together": ["B0056031LE", "B004QSQMG8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B008BJTQ0W", "B004QSQMG8", "B0056031LE", "B0047HXMMU"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 20246}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 15.9, "brand": "WGBH BOSTON VIDEO", "asin": "B0000ZG0TA", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/414PG1K98AL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "NOVA - The Elegant Universe"}
{"description": "Granada Television's powerful adaptation of John Galsworthy's novels about the sprawling, fractious and aristocratic Forsyte family moves into the 1920s with Series Two, based on the author'sTo Let. The drama shifts to a new generation shouldering the burdensome legacies of an aging Soames (Damian Lewis) and his failed marriage to free-spirited Irene (Gina McKee). The lovely Fleur (Emma Griffiths Malin), Soames's daughter by second wife Annette (Beatriz Batarda), and strapping Jon (Lee Williams), son of Irene and Soames's bohemian cousin, Jolyon (Rupert Graves), develop a romance much to the dismay of their feuding parents. But the long reach of the elder Forsytes' sins--and the tenderness with which they seek redemption through their children--ultimately undercuts the young lovers' happiness.Meanwhile, sundry characters move in and out of the Forsytes' orbit, including a French businessman (Michael Maloney) stirring more troubles for Soames and an art dealer (Oliver Milburn) with designs on Fleur. As withSeries One, all this will feel familiar to anyone who has seen the26-part, 1967 versionofThe Forsyte Saga(the program that arguably created public television as we know it). Yet this updated effort renews and redefines the Forsytes' overlapping tragedies, with a more interior feel and a first-rate contemporary cast. As with its legendary predecessor, thisForsyte Sagadepends heavily on the seemingly soulless Soames's slow evolution to humanity; Damian Lewis carries the load brilliantly.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00006FHZE", "B0083HXKMC", "B004JMSIQS", "B00007149J", "B004N66XYE", "B0090XUARQ", "B007701RFS", "B000GIXLUC", "B0013NAMLK", "B000E0ODZE", "B00HUAH14Q", "B0099Y2MYK", "B007A2O3FO", "B001P807RC", "B00F1BFRA6", "B00B62R9XM", "B00065GX96", "B009L2EW5W", "B000A8AXXG", "B004JMSIVI", "B0002S648C", "B0080QOL10", "B009DS6YGO", "B00062IZ0Y", "B00FPPQYXM", "B00005JOA0", "B00HGE90Z4", "B00HHYF5DE", "B000G6BM0K", "B004H0ZHD4", "B00BIR2A3E", "B008UQUS26", "B0074FUSFG", "B001AXL67W", "B000AYEL6U", "B00DW5ILF6", "B002XTBECY", "B005T0OY5S", "B00E3UN66I", "B004499LWG", "B0093I913W", "B00124SNKC", "B005GP7ELW", "B0009PVZL4", "0062116517", "B00005JKNF", "B00AZMFO6I", "B00F1BFNFA", "B003WEAW18", "B00FRILRZC", "B0000AQS3P", "B001PU8O5W", "B00BBXSP84", "B000784WNQ", "B001JXPC7S", "B005S9EJ14", "B0009PVZM8", "B00141188M", "B002EWD0I6", "B008KEQLW4", "B00003JRCQ", "B00E1LT41K", "B008PDAENC", "B001EO748M", "B000M2E32M", "B00BCXW106", "B0006FO8E8", "B0006Q93H4", "B007ZQAKFW", "B004FGA2MQ", "B001PU8N0I", "B00005YUNK", "B000R349IO", "B000JLTS80", "B00003CXSA", "B00ECGHVHI", "B00B83OIVA", "B000NOIX48", "B00ARX2VZW", "B003CP1T50", "B00A27O0N4", "B00BC5I6Q2", "B00AATGDUC", "B00003CX8N", "B005Q1W10A", "B00CDTSFF8"], "bought_together": ["B00006FHZE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0083HXKMC", "B00006FHZE", "B00007149J", "B00EF0NVGQ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 75387}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 24.81, "brand": "PBS", "asin": "B00015GA8A", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51V66GNZ1WL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Forsyte Saga, Series 2"}

{"description": "Now firmly established as the top-rated television drama, by its third yearCSI: Crime Scene Investigationis a show positively glowing with confidence. Even when individual cases seem either too contrived or too easily resolved, the indefatigable night shift at the Las Vegas PD crime lab always look the part, solving conundrums and discovering microscopic damning evidence while, apparently, never shedding their own loose hair or skin cells all over the supposedly quarantined crime scenes. In reality, Catherine Willows's flowing blonde locks would contaminate any evidence she collected, but in the world ofCSIonly the bad guys leave body parts behind--the CSIs themselves are so good they're positively pristine.The 23 episodes of season 3 on this five-disc set present more deliciously bizarre situations for the problem-solving sleuths: cannibalism, snuff movies, dwarfs, death while drag racing, bodies falling from the sky, and various dismemberments all tax the team's acumen. These are all double or multiple-case episodes, though in a characteristic trick of the writing sometimes apparently unrelated murders turn out to be connected (or vice versa, as in \"Blood Lust,\" in which a road-accident victim is not what he seems, and the death of the driver at the hands of an angry mob is made all the more tragic). The mix of genuine forensic science with the glossiest Jerry Bruckheimer production values, plus the virtues of a good ensemble cast headed by William Peterson's modern-day Sherlock Holmes, remains as compelling as ever.--Mark Walker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000A2ZNL", "B0002NY8GW", "B000B8IA08", "B00008972G", "B000H7JCGY", "B000UX6TIE", "B001CQONKY", "B001G0MFIS", "B003FSTN5M", "B003R0MEZO", "B0058YPJ8G", "B00915G6TE", "B000B8I9ZO", "B000SO7PCE", "B00064VQXA", "B000H7JCE6", "B000B5XOVQ", "B001BL6QE6", "B001G0MFLA", "B001S86J3K", "B00020H9NO", "B000H7JCEG", "B003FSTN6G", "B000UAE7QI", "B001BL6QDW", "B003R0MF0S", "B005PYL8VQ", "B00BLN4V4G", "B001G0MFL0", "B003FSTN5W", "B003R0MF08", "B00915G6OE", "B008F283WW", "B005PYKVRI", "B001AI776G", "B000SQFC40", "B000ION72Q", "B001G0MFKQ", "B000LE178Y", "B003TFAJ18", "B003R0MEZ4", "B0002DRE72", "B000GA3LX2", "B0058YPILY", "B002CLKV5Y", "B000KGH00W", "B005PYKNJY", "B00080Z5FM", "B001992NWO", "B009LDD4V4", "B000HT3P60", "B001F7Q4JS", "B00915G6SU", "B003Q7B7B0", "B000TGJ8AS", "B0053O89IS", "B00CYQXATG", "B000H7JCHS", "B003L77G8I", "B0002CX224", "B002JVWR4A", "B00KS9V6EC", "B000FVQLIO", "B0080QOKHU", "B003UD7J26", "B00EIXWMII", "B000EWBNMI", "B0018RKEQY", "B000RO6JYK", "B00KHA9BQ2", "B000MGBSIK", "B005PYL4VU", "B0013DZNAA", "B00915G6NK", "B00915G6MG", "B001L1S1OY", "B00JK47BHM", "B0019F02X0", "B003L77G2E", "B00CYQXGAY", "B00CYQXDNE", "B001QE99AQ", "B00FR23QNE", "B00CP6YNGO", "B002C2KAS6", "B001B8Y0BK", "B0001K5GOO", "B000SQFC1S", "B00D1VVT3C", "B001A4VH2U", "B00BTFK01Y", "B00915G4IC", "1439160783", "B00005JO3P", "B0002Y4TWE", "B00005JLFT", "B0066E6SGY", "B000R9YLKY", "B005GP7EVC"], "bought_together": ["B0000A2ZNL", "B0002NY8GW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00008972G", "B0000A2ZNL", "B0002NY8GW", "B001CQONKY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 10974}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 14.8, "brand": "Paramount", "asin": "B0001906X6", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51hbwUtVs2L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation: Season 3"}

Although there's still no Wachowski brothers talking about their creation, there's a lot of good stuff here in the three main segments.

When a white rabbit flashes on screen, you can \"branch\" the most interesting documentary footage: how \"bullet time\" is being recalibrated and how you go about replicating so many Agent Smiths.

{"description": "As the triumphant start of a trilogy,The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ringleaves you begging for more. By necessity, Peter Jackson's ambitious epic compresses J.R.R. Tolkien's classicThe Lord of the Rings, but this robust adaptation maintains reverent allegiance to Tolkien's creation, instantly qualifying as one of the greatest fantasy films ever made. At 178 minutes, it's long enough to establish the myriad inhabitants of Middle-earth, the legendary Rings of Power, and the fellowship of hobbits, elves, dwarves, and humans--led by the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and the brave hobbit Frodo (Elijah Wood)--who must battle terrifying forces of evil on their perilous journey to destroy the One Ring in the land of Mordor. Superbly paced, the film is both epic and intimate, offering astonishing special effects and production design while emphasizing the emotional intensity of Frodo's adventure, and ends on a perfect note of heroic loyalty and rich anticipation.After the breaking of the Fellowship, Frodo and Sam journey to Mordor with the creature Gollum as their guide inThe Two Towers. Meanwhile, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom), and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) join in the defense of the people of Rohan, who are the first target in the eradication of the race of Men by the renegade wizard Saruman (Christopher Lee) and the dark lord Sauron. Fantastic creatures, astounding visual effects, and a climactic battle at the fortress of Helm's Deep makeThe Two Towersa worthy successor toThe Fellowship of the Ring, grander in scale but retaining the story's emotional intimacy.WithThe Return of the King, the greatest fantasy epic in film history draws to a grand and glorious conclusion. The trilogy could never fully satisfy those who remain exclusively loyal to Tolkien's expansive literature, but as a showcase for physical and technical craftsmanship it is unsurpassed in pure scale and ambition, setting milestone after cinematic milestone as Frodo and Sam continue their mission to Mordor to destroy the soul-corrupting One Ring. While the heir to the kingdom of Men, Aragorn, endures the massive battle at Minas Tirith with the allegiance of Legolas, Gimli, and Gandalf, Frodo and Sam must survive the schizoid deceptions of Gollum, who remains utterly convincing as a hybrid of performance (by Andy Serkis) and subtly nuanced computer animation. Jackson and cowriters Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens have much ground to cover; that they do so with intense pacing and epic sweep is impressive enough, but by investing greater depth and consequence in the actions of fellow hobbits Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd), they ensure thatThe Return of the Kingmaintains the trilogy's emphasis on intimate fellowship and remains faithful to Tolkien's overall vision. By ending theLOTRtrilogy with noble integrity and faith in the power of imaginative storytelling,The Return of the King, like its predecessors, will stand as an adventure for the ages.--Jeff Shannon and David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00BEZTMFY", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B005OCFGTO", "B001DJLD1M", "B001BYMX4A", "B009JBWOU0", "B00003CXCT", "B00005JPH2", "B001BRJZPW", "B000QXDED6", "B000E8M0VA", "B000VWYJ86", "B000HEVZ9E", "B005COPWZW", "B00005JKZY", "0345538374", "B001F12J0C", "B0057RCFQS", "B00003CWT6", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00003CXC5", "B000I0RQVI", "B0060FXDCG", "B0054OGQM8", "B004M1A21K", "B001DHXT20", "B008MIMWP8", "B008JFUO72", "B001VLFE7G", "B00G1BPIOU", "B002HWRYJE", "B000YGDNPO", "B000VBIGCW", "B00E9PMML2", "B004H83IM8", "B004EPZ08O", "B0015XHP4A", "B001E75QH0", "B0090SI56Y", "B000P0J0AQ", "B001VLBDD0", "B008JFUS0U", "B00IV2I7IQ", "B003PIUINS", "B000UR9T8C", "B000U7WV1Y", "B006VRRGNK", "B007D5E7C2", "0345518845", "B0049IHX2C", "B00AZMFJYA", "B0015I2RT8", "B004LWZWGA", "B002I9Z8I0", "B0001HLVS2", "B002VPE1AW", "B004LWZW42", "B00003CXZ4", "B00E5I2MCM", "B004EPYZU8", "B008JFURII", "B00003CXC3", "B005LAIH54", "6305313687", "B0084IG8TM", "B00000K3D4", "B001CK1D44", "B00AEFXDO6", "B002ZG999U", "B00E9PMMX0", "B0042U94UQ", "B00275EGWY", "B001KVZ6FW", "B003Q6D2B4", "B000J4P9P8", "B0001Z4OXS", "B00177YA1K", "B003UYUQZW", "B0019L770A", "B000E6ESEY", "B003AWRMCE", "B000HCO83Q", "B00AEBB8FQ", "B0083SBMBM", "B001GZ6QC4", "B00011CZRE", "079284646X", "B00008G8M5", "B002ZG97YM", "B002ZG980U", "B000QQLVPQ", "B00E5I2M6I", "B00AEFY0F2", "B000U1ZV8K", "B008UZA8FY", "B005LAIIMG", "B004EPZ084", "B003EYVXTG", "B00005JKZV", "B00447L4JG"], "bought_together": ["B00BEZTMFY", "B00HWWUQWQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00HWWUQWQ", "B00005JKZY", "B00BEZTMFY", "B00003CWT6"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 72846}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 39.99, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B0001VL0K2", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51z4rwl-jOL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Lord of the Rings: The Motion Picture Trilogy (Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "\"Closure.

Television's most popular and comforting comedy did go gently into that good night, packing off new parents Monica and Chandler to the suburbs to start a family; domesticating the once free-spirited Phoebe, and, yes, finally bringing star-crossed, on-again-off-again Ross and Rachel together (\"I got off the plane\" will take its place in series lore alongside, \"We were on a break\").There were some keenly felt absences, most notably Elliott Gould and Christina Pickles as Monica and Ross's maddening parents, and very few surprises, save for one climactic Ross revelation that allowed David Schwimmer's hapless character one of the episode's best lines: \"We almost made it 10 years without that coming out.\" Gunther professing his unrequited love for Paris-bound Rachel was a nice grace note for one of the series' most valuable players, as was the touching, sniffle-inducing ending in which each Friend turned in their key to the apartment each had shared at one time or another over the past 10 years.

{"description": "What's scarier than scary kids?Village of the Damnedis the definitive scary-kid classic, a truly unsettling film drawn from John Wyndham's novelThe Midwich Cuckoos. The brilliant opening sequence depicts the sudden and temporary paralysis of a small English hamlet, which is followed by the town's women becoming mysteriously pregnant. The spawn of this occurrence are a dozen eerie, blond-headed children, who are either gifted, evil, or \"the world's new people.\" A splendid outing, not least in the way it catches parental anxiety about this small new stranger in one's home. (It was remade by John Carpenter in 1995.)Children of the Damnedfollows up with a story about six more creepy kids, brought from all over the globe to huddle in a old church in London. An excellent opening half-hour gets bogged down in the movie's global-political ambitions (it's very much a cold war offering), but it has its share of shivery moments--the sight of the six youngsters striding down a London street as though they controlled the world is a chiller. But where's the blond hair? The two films are different in tone;Villagefeels like a fifties sci-fi offering, with an old-school star (George Sanders) and classical style;Childrenis a film of the sixties, with hipper techniques, urban setting, and young actors Ian Hendry and Alan Badel. But both have those damned kids.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783230427", "B000A0GOF0", "B00027JYNK", "B0009X75EC", "B000063UR0", "B007Y1NNAW", "B00LU4URS0", "B0000694WH", "B00005R1O7", "B000AYELJ2", "B00009NHC0", "B0007R4T26", "B005HIBWBG", "B002945DUW", "B000RXVNDI", "B00AEBB8VK", "B00518A70E", "B000UDGOBG", "6305869367", "B0045HCJJE", "B00D9EJFV4", "B00LC4PEZ4", "B00D9EJFZA", "B000G6BLYM", "B001B9ZVVC", "B00005JKFR", "B00000K3U3", "B00005LIRD", "0783116926", "B000EHSVJG", "B00005NSXY", "B000UAFDR0", "B00K6D1S7A", "B000FOPPEC", "B000A0GOEQ", "B000A0GOFA", "B00DZP1C9K", "B000OHZJGO", "B005ETANC2", "B000068TPG", "0991127900", "B000AQKU72", "6305761078", "B0045HCJSA", "B0048O2YWG", "B00DOZNGC2", "B0034PWPHY", "B000C20VNM", "B00KSPST6Y", "B00023P4TM", "B000HT38B2", "B0009X770E", "B00009PY4D", "B000FFJZO2", "B00KIZY0EE", "B00K2CHVSK", "B0000694WM", "B0009X770O", "B000S0GYBG", "B000FVQLKW", "B0013XZ6SY", "B00AEBB94G", "B00009NHBC", "B004X63SCY", "B00KIZYDCI", "B00B94VJYW", "B000062XEY", "B0053TWVDC", "B001BSBBNK", "6305944288", "B00009PY2T", "B001BSBBGC", "B005D0RDKM", "B000BYA5IC", "B00003CXCF", "B000RXVNCO", "B000OHBCI8", "B00009PY4A", "B00009PY38", "B00006SFIT", "B00023P4UQ", "B00027JYLC", "B002TSAAS8", "B00DSAUJ32", "B00465I1BK", "B00005Y6XR", "B00005R1O8", "B00IYJFB2G", "B0045HCJKS", "B0002IQL8K", "B005GPFZEK", "B000TLTCT0", "B000EHSVJ6", "B000HEWEDK", "B00ITZXDDY", "B0000A9GHP", "6305772681", "B00006CXGP", "6305772142", "B0009PLLMC"], "bought_together": ["0783230427"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0783230427", "B00027JYNK", "B0009X75EC", "B000063UR0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 29525}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.05, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00027JYMG", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51SknyPjhrL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Village of the Damned/Children of the Damned"}

{"description": "There's not one cougar to be found in24's dynamic third season, and that's good news for everyone. After Jack Bauer's daughter Kim (Elisha Cuthbert) survived hokey hazards inseason 2, she's now a full-time staffer at CTU, the L.A.-based intelligence beehive that's abuzz once again--three years after the events of \"Day Two\"--when a vengeful terrorist threatens to release a lethal virus that could wipe out much of the country's population. Jack (Kiefer Sutherland) attempts to broker a deal for the virus involving drug kingpin Ramon Salazar (Joaquim de Almeida), whose operation Jack successfully infiltrated at high personal cost: to maintain his cover, he got hooked on heroin. That potentially deadly triangle--drug lords, addiction, and bioterrorism on a massive scale--sets the 24-hour clock ticking in a tight, action-packed plot involving a potential traitor in CTU's midst; the return of TV's greatest villainesses in Nina Meyers (Sarah Clarke) and former First Lady Sherry Palmer (Penny Johnson Jerald); a troubled romance between Kim and Jack's new partner Chase (James Badge Dale); and a scandalized reelection campaign by president David Palmer (Dennis Haysbert), who monitors CTU as they struggle to (literally) save the day.The intricately woven subplots that are24's greatest strength are masterfully developed here, and character arcs are equally strong, especially among CTU staffers Tony (Carlos Bernard) and his wife Michelle (Reiko Aylesworth); CTU director Ryan Chappelle (Paul Schulze), who is season 3's tragic bargaining chip; and the annoying but well-intentioned Chloe O'Brian (Mary Lynn Rajskub), who makes pivotal contributions with by-the-book efficiency. It's24's superior casting that overcomes the series' occasional lapses in credibility, and season 3's twists make marathon viewing a nerve-wracking delight. By the time it's all over,24once again leaves you gratefully exhausted. As always, Sutherland anchors the series in the role he was born to play. When Jack takes a private moment to release 24 hours' worth of near-fatal tension and psychological anguish, Sutherland proves that24's dramatic priorities are as important as its thriller momentum. DVD extras include behind-the-scenes featurettes (about the prison break sequence, climactic F-18 Hornet air-strike, and real-life bio-weaponry) that pay welcome tribute to the series' hard-working crew, who create Emmy-worthy television under pressures as intense as24itself.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00008YGRU", "B000B837XI", "B000ICLRKC", "B000NDEXKW", "B000NDEXK2", "B000MR8W92", "B001L5SRJE", "B002ZCY7SW", "B001DMVZOE", "B0015QWZ8S", "B002ZCY7TG", "B00G4RCXPI", "0756632277", "B003PGNBO8", "B00AIBZMD6", "B003FSTN52", "B00J5LXT44", "B000YABIQ6", "B00HLTD3ZW", "B00HEPE6MM", "B003L77GK6", "B00005JOC9", "B002N5N5QQ", "B0024FAR5M", "B00BC5I6Q2", "B00HT850YW", "B001F12J0C", "B00BFAIH68", "B00JJRLFVS", "B005PPMHO2", "B00HUCF420", "B0049P1VHS", "B00ECHBSP8", "B00H57HOSC", "B00HGE90Z4", "B00GTZWZH6", "B00IKM5LXG", "B00AB65RUG", "B0058YPG1G", "B00J49R0ZQ", "B00JA3RVG4", "B00E8OMZGG", "B00EIXWMII", "B008JFUNTG", "B0058YPL66", "B00JF5GAZA"], "bought_together": ["B00008YGRU", "B000B837XI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00008YGRU", "B000NDEXK2", "B000ICLRKC", "B000NDEXKW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 4783}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 24.55, "brand": "20TH Century Fox", "asin": "B0002XVQSU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51FD9X234WL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "24: Season 3"}

{"description": "Sex and the Cityis based on Candace Bushnell's provocative bestselling book. Sarah Jessica Parker stars as Carrie Bradshaw, a self-described \"sexual anthropologist,\" who writes \"Sex and the City,\" a newspaper column that chronicles the state of sexual affairs of Manhattanites in this \"age of un-innocence.\" Her \"posse,\" including nice girl Charlotte (Kristin Davis), hard-edged Miranda (Cynthia Nixon), and party girl Samantha (Kim Cattrall)--not to mention her own tumultuous love life--gives Carrie plenty of column fodder. Over the course of the first season's 12 episodes, the most prominent dramatic arc concerns Carrie, who goes from turning the tables on \"toxic bachelors\" by having \"sex like a man\" to wanting to join the ranks of \"the monogamists\" with the elusive Mr. Big (Chris Noth). Meanwhile, Miranda, Cynthia, and Samantha have their own dating woes.The second season builds on the foundation of the first season with plot arcs that are both hilarious and heartfelt, taking the show from breakout hit to true pop-culture phenomenon. Relationship epiphanies coexist happily alongside farcical plots and zingy one-liners, resulting in emotionally satisfying episodes that feature the sharp kind of character-defining dialogue that seems to have disappeared from the rest of TV long ago. When last we left the NYC gals, Carrie had just broken up with a commitment-phobic Mr. Big (Chris Noth), but fans of Noth's seductive-yet-distant rake didn't have to wait long until he was back in the picture, as he and Carrie tried to make another go of it. Their relationship evolution, from reunion to second breakup, provides the core of the second season. Among other adventures, Charlotte puzzles over whether one of her beaus was \"gay-straight\" or \"straight-gay\"; Miranda tries to date a guy who insists on having sex only in places where they might get caught; and Samantha copes with dates who range from, um, not big enough tofartoo big--with numerous stops in between.The third season was the charm, as the series earned its first Emmy for Outstanding Comedy Series to go along with its Golden Globes for Best Comedy Series and Best Actress (Parker). One of this season's two principal story arcs concerned hapless-in-love Charlotte and her pursuit of a husband; enter (if only...) Kyle McLachlan as the unfortunately impotent Trey. Meanwhile, Carrie has a brief but memorable fling with a politician who's golden, but not in the way she anticipated. She then sabotages her too-good-to-be-true relationship with furniture designer Aidan (John Corbett) by having an affair with Mr. Big (Chris Noth), who himself has gotten married. LikeI Love Lucy, the series benefited from a brief change of scenery with a three-episode jaunt to Los Angeles, where Carrie and company encountered, among others, Matthew McConaughey, Vince Vaughn, Hugh Hefner, and Sarah Michelle Gellar.The fourth season is just as smart and sexy as ever, mixing caustic adult wit and sharply observed situation comedy on the mean streets of Manhattan, though this time the quartet of singleton city girls must endure even tougher combat in the unending war of love, sex, and shopping. Carrie finally seems to have found her ideal life partner when she is reunited with handsome craftsman Aidan. But can their relationship survive trial by cohabitation? Meanwhile Charlotte seems to have both her dream Park Avenue apartment and a solution to her marital problems with Trey. But when the subject of babies comes up, everything starts to unravel for her, too. It's not just Charlotte who has baby issues either: after what seems like an eternity of enforced sexual abstinence Miranda is horrified to discover she's pregnant. And as for the sultry Samantha, she's on a quest for monogamy, first with an exotic lesbian artist, then with a philandering businessman, with whom to her utter dismay she just might have fallen in love.It was a short but sweet fifth season, as HBO's resident comediennes found themselves affected by forces beyond their control--the pregnancies of both Sarah Jessica Parker and Cynthia Nixon. A truncated shooting schedule to accommodate the actresses forced this season to be reduced to a mere eight episodes, but they and creators forged ahead, creating a handful of episodes that if short in content were long on emotion and laughs. Carrie and Miranda wrestled with their solitary lifestyles, albeit with new attachments--Miranda had new baby Brady and single motherhood, while Carrie found herself in the world of publishing as the author of a real-life book of her columns. Charlotte wondered if she'd ever find another man, while Samantha finally got rid of the one that had been vexing her far too much. If the season as a whole felt less than the sum of its parts, those parts were some of the best comedy in the show's history. The season's climactic episode, \"I Love a Charade,\" was one of the series' best episodes ever, equally touching and funny, and grounded the show in an emotional maturity that announced that after all their wild travails, these women had truly grown up.After a long wait--like the entire fifth season--Carrie is dating again. The sixth season starts with Carrie and her sparkly new potential, Berger (Ron Livingston), trying to leave past relationships and hit it off, with mixed results. Meanwhile Carrie's friends seem to be settling down, relatively speaking. Miranda decides that her affair with TiVo cannot compete when Mr. Perfect (Blair Underwood, at his most charming) moves into her building. Charlotte's feelings for her \"opposites attract\" boyfriend (Evan Handler) deepen, but they still have a few things to iron out. Most surprising is Samantha's hot relationship with waiter-actor-stud Smith Jerrod (Jason Lewis) taking on something resembling love, despite Samantha's best intentions. Before the sixth season started in the summer of 2003, a bombshell hit: it was announced that this would be the finale. But it would be a long season, and these 12 episodes plant the seeds for the final 8 airing the following winter. These dozen episodes illustrate the maturity of the show: there's not a bad one in the bunch, and the show is still flat-out funny. The comedy blends serious points of how we perceive singles, couples, and parents (and the gifts we lavish on the latter two). Carrie's method of celebrating her singlehood is just another gem in this treasure of a series.With the last eight episodes of the sixth season, HBO's grand sitcom concluded, leaving untold numbers of women--and many men--feeling deprived. The six-year series certainly did not outlast its welcome; the final season is some of the best TV had to offer in 2004. In many ways, the eight episodes served as a single finale, with all four characters approaching a kind of destiny and happiness, the theme of this last half-season (which aired weeks after the first half). Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) continues her romance with Russian artist (Mikhail Baryshnikov), a flippantly arrogant man who's been around the block, but able to supply Carrie's needed desire for magic. Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) has settled down with Steve (David Eigenberg), but there is more that will change with her, including her address. Charlotte (Kristin Davis) continues to make baby plans now that the husband slot is filled quite nicely (Evan Handler). Going down the final stretch--and Samantha's (Kim Cattrall) cancer--gives the series a more serious tone, but there's always a jab to tickle the funny bone: Miranda's awkwardness with happiness, Charlotte's latest passion, Carrie typing someplace new, and Samantha getting into Paris Hilton territory. Like any series winding down, there is a wedding, a baby, old faces popping up, and some star-ladened new ones.

{"description": "Standeris the compelling, true story of Andre Stander (superbly played by Tom--formerly Thomas--Jane), an Apartheid-era, South African police captain whose disgust over official repression of the nation's black majority--and his own, lethal participation in those policies--leads to his career as a bank robber. Captured, imprisoned, and on the run after a successful escape, Stander joins two partners (Dexter Fletcher, David Patrick O'Hara) in a long string of bank heists across the country, uncertain of his destiny but yearning for his estranged wife (Deborah Unger). Co-screenwriter and director Bronwen Hughes (Forces of Nature) can't quite overcome the built-in redundancy of the film's latter half (lots of robberies, lots of disguises). But despite all the gunplay,Standeris most interesting for its understated fascination with the enigma of its anti-hero, who wreaks havoc yet is peculiarly committed to atoning--at great pain--for those actions he considers most unethical.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002SF9YT8", "B0000714BW", "B00CX7TOOG", "B000093FLA", "B0001I55TC", "B001E0ADF2", "B0002IQMAM", "B002J4KQ6S", "B000EPFCPE", "B008E70EES", "B0007R4T3U", "B004SIP7VM", "B00AEBBA4K", "B00HOGBXS6", "B000FC2FX8", "B00005JLJW", "B00C1LIZI0", "B000K7UBSO", "B00AKIPALG", "B000C20VPA", "B0009X76ZK", "B00H1RMWYW", "0767802578", "B004499LX0", "B000B6COF2", "B000PGINMQ", "B0034G4OUO", "B00005JLSB", "B00003CXDJ", "B00D5XC8PE", "B004SIP7TE", "B002DU39GW", "B000ZM1MGE", "B002ZG97RE", "B005LAIILM", "B00F98FOPE", "B002CPMB9O", "B0087DFIYA", "B001UV4XGA", "B0000ZMGWK", "B001AZKB8K", "B002SYAGNC", "B004IFYMWK", "B00996RSYM", "B00DU22OI6", "B0029O0ANW", "B009HIKAN8", "6304698747", "B005LAIGLE", "B0010SAGHS", "B004UVYQYQ", "B006512BFU", "B00AEFXVCU", "B006A9XTYY", "B00BTYOYGW", "B007C4ZJ0S", "B000P0J0AG", "B005S9EJ8W", "B000NTPG6Q", "B00BLF9FOK", "0767805712", "B000683VHA", "B000B8QG22", "B00BB67UNW", "B00AEFYO5I", "B00AEFXESQ", "B0000DI87S", "B000NHHFEE", "B000A343RS", "B000FP8BNI"], "bought_together": ["B0002IQMAM"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002J4KQ6S", "B000I2KRZI", "B005GRF3DG", "B002SF9YT8"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 98671}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 15.99, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B000683VHK", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518z9rOohcL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Stander"}
{"description": "Columbia TriStar surprised a lot ofForever Knightfans by releasing the second season of the cult supernatural series on DVD, despite underwhelming sales of thefirst-season set; what's even more exciting about this six-disc box for longtime followers are its supplemental features, which include commentary by star Geraint Wyn Davies and series co-creator James Parriott. Overall, the second season is marked by change, both in front of and behind the camera: vampire detective Nick Knight's former master and nemesis, LaCroix  (Nigel Bennett), takes a more active role in the series, and offers a direct threat to Nick's desire to become mortal again, while Nick's lengthy past is explored more deeply in flashbacks. Gary Farmer's Captain Stonetree is gone, having been replaced by Natsuko Ohama as Captain Cohen-&#x96;however, she too would leave the show by season's end, as would Gary Kapelos (Nick's partner, Schanke), and Deborah Duchene (Janette Ducharme).What didn't deviate from the first season was the abundance of exciting and imaginative stories--highlights from season 2 include \"Stranger Than Fiction,\" in which Nick falls for an Ann Rice-like writer; \"Father's Day,\" which partners LaCroix with the Mob; the return of Jack the Ripper in \"Bad Blood\"; and \"Baby Baby,\" one of two second-season episodes directed (quite well) by Wyn Davies. Extras include Wyn Davies and Parriott providing commentary for two episodes (\"Blood Money\" and \"Killer Instinct\"), while Nigel Bennett goes it alone for a pair (\"A More Permanent Hell\" and \"Curiouser and Curiouser\"). Parriott and Wyn Davies also appear in a 20-minute featurette (titled, appropriately enough, \"About the Show\"), and a brief segment in which they answer questions posited by series devotees. In short, season 2 has plenty forFKaficionados to (ahem) sink their teeth into.--Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000C23T1", "B000H5TH16", "B004YPED14", "B0000844IS", "B00344EAG4", "B001UGJUSG", "B002DLB1H0", "B002QU1Z1K", "B00E5G03J8", "B00170LCWC", "B008I34YOO", "B000CEV3MI", "B000QUEQ4U", "B005SW2ROC", "B0007DA3V6", "B000EOTV98", "B00092A1J4", "B0012IX35S", "B000001P1P", "B000W4KT9G", "B00IYMSMTM", "B0030VANIU", "B0002MHDW4", "B005GP7ELM", "B001VG2ME4", "B003XMKU0M", "B003H9LIU2", "B00BHLTIXQ", "B001PXYH9G", "B003BGZ61S", "B000SMNL92", "B00F1BFZXA", "B00GTZWVXE", "B00000J7W6", "B000JLTRHW", "B00344EAFU", "B00HSSZKAW", "B00IWTVDUW", "B005PPMHO2", "B006LG74RE", "B0037AGB9O", "B00ED2IBXE", "B00E96AYYS", "B00FUABG1C", "B0006Z2KZ2", "B000ATQYXI", "B002FLOTPO", "B0009JE6G6", "B000BOH8Y6", "B006LPHY6G", "B000E1NXCM", "B000E0ODKY", "B00005B8UD", "B000I0QLR8", "B00JF5G8WU", "B00061QJSK", "B00344EAKA", "B0081QF6Q8", "B000ATQYWY", "B004U7MQYC", "B002FG9N50", "B0010YVCAM", "B000WTZ6SK", "B000PHX8RA", "B0011FLH00", "B0010TDRP0", "B000FFJYBQ", "B00023BKMC", "B004EXWGHY", "B00CPTUNR4", "B00133QNSG", "B000AO9BSS", "B0009JE6FM", "B000Z6GT4K", "B0007CEXUY", "B005GYXN2M", "B000I0QLS2", "B001RXDM1I", "B00GX7D5G0", "B00166UFTI", "B005EVY8NA", "B003BV8I7C", "B0030VANJO", "B000O77SMW", "B00DTRR43W", "B00133QNS6", "B009T3AGK8", "B001ILFUB4", "B004HYW84G", "B007AFC0W4", "B0012IXBNC", "B00CRX82LM", "B002EOVXA6", "B00076ONVY", "B007V4QKYI", "B005NQ5LLE", "B002EOVXEW", "B009LDD5XQ", "B000ELL1QC", "B001MVYUQG"], "bought_together": ["B0000C23T1", "B000H5TH16"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0000C23T1", "B004YPED14", "B000H5TH16", "B00E5G03J8"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 99144}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 20.69, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B0006D3HE2", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41yi3QnB8AL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Forever Knight - The Trilogy, Part 2"}
{"description": "Wonderfallsis probably the most hilarious show you've never seen. An hour-long \"dramedy\" about a young woman who hears the voices of inanimate objects--which instruct her to help out total strangers--the show aired on Fox in early 2004 to critical acclaim and dismal ratings. After airing four times in terrible time slots, the show was quickly canceled, but not before a hue and cry from a small but fervently devoted cadre of fans went up, begging for all 13 episodes to be released on DVD. Thus, the highest-profile DVD release of a canceled show was born, and the nine unaired episodes ofWonderfallsare finally seeing the light of day.You may be wondering: is it worth it to check out a show that was axed so quickly? The answer is an unqualified yes, asWonderfallsis quirky without being precious, sardonic without being bitter, and smart without being a show-off about it. Jaye (Caroline Dhavernas) is a graduate of Brown University who's opted not to put her education to work, and instead lives in a trailer and works at a tourist shop in Niagara Falls, to the consternation of her affluent, successful family. All seems to be going well for this self-proclaimed slacker, until one day a small toy lion speaks to her in enigmatic epigrams, commanding her to help people. Loath to deal in any compassionate way with the rest of humanity, Jaye warily obeys, if only to make the voices stop. Soon, though, she finds herself to be an unwilling humanitarian and accidental hero when more inanimate objects start talking to her, and more people turn out to need her help.The premise may sound a bit too off-the-beaten-path, butWonderfalls' meddling with the ethereal was grounded in a keen awareness of post-college life and the travails befalling young twentysomethings who had no idea where their life was going. And instead of being sanctimonious or inspiring, the show was instead a complex mix of the heartfelt and the angsty, and Dhavernas was one of the most cynically hopeful heroines to grace the small screen. The rest of the cast was also topnotch, including Kate Finneran as Jaye's high-strung sister, Diana Scarwid as her caustic mother, and Tyron Leitso as bartender Eric, whose tentative romance with Jaye was both affecting and hilarious. Think ofWonderfallsas less of a failure and more of a rare opportunity to see some of the most creative television in recent memory.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001FB4VZ8", "B000YAA2SQ", "B00GT2TEPU", "B001A7X0ZO", "B001FB4VZI", "B0000JD29M", "B001BPJJ9G", "B001UJUGZY", "B0024FABCG", "B001XW7ICW", "B0018M6J90", "B001BPJJ82", "B004TFTE8Q", "B0001GF2F6", "B001UJUGZO", "B0025KVKDO", "B00094ARGY", "B001ASIHZG", "B004EC5ITI", "B008XEZXDO", "B000M341SC", "B002AK9UPO", "B00HUCF7AO", "B006H3KQWG", "B000HWZ4MA", "B004CYF78U", "B004TPJN3W", "B00540G3GG", "B00HEQOAQ8", "B0007TKHKC", "B000NA2BEU", "B000GFLEKY", "B0002JP4DW", "B00KLF5J64", "B00CWIMVDW", "B001PKHS6I", "B001EN5I3Q", "B00A8KJN8M", "B005GNU5VK", "B00L326LTI", "B00KCTG4PO", "B00C2535PI", "B000E3L7F0", "B00HEQOAIQ", "B000FL7CAK", "B0006UEVUE", "B00062WUQY", "B00E3UN44W", "B0033WH6MW", "B000OY9VFW", "B0000AQS0F", "B002VRNIZO", "B001M5UDGS", "B00CWIMY3O", "B00435XPFA", "B000XUF6BU", "B0092PX26S", "0804170703", "B001E95ZNS", "B003VSJPPO", "B0081QF6Q8", "B002N5N5LG", "B00JAQJNN0", "B001XRLWLU", "B000ATQYXI", "B004BZ5AHI", "B006JN87WK", "B00005JNU5", "B00BSU0FQA", "B00KHA9BQ2", "B001PMRBMC", "B002HFWBI0", "B00IKKQT1G", "B009LDCVJU", "B002C3GTLC", "B009LDCW1M", "B00ECR7KX2", "B001B9LWME", "B0056GLNQI", "B005G1729K", "B003L77GQ0", "B0017KP8Y0", "B003VVBZ7M", "B002DQSKME", "B001DF681G", "0425228223", "B003X82CZ2", "B00I099JSW", "B00ISSF7S6", "B00191AEYQ", "B00I3H61AA", "B00662CH02", "1402799977", "B000BW7QWW", "B001QE99BA", "B00GTZWZH6", "B0037AGB9O", "B00HGE90Z4", "B0025KVKBQ", "B005PPMHO2"], "bought_together": ["B001FB4VZ8", "B000YAA2SQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001FB4VZ8", "B000YAA2SQ", "B001BPJJ9G", "B00GT2TEPU"]}, "price": 19.17, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 25154}, "asin": "B0006GAO18", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51PysUka7tL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Wonderfalls - The Complete Series"}

{"description": "Dave Chappelle's shrewd parodies, stinging satires, and boldly imaginative fantasias simply pour from the second season of his Comedy Central show, in every respect as funny as his well-received debut year. The structure is the same: a relaxed Chappelle introduces each sketch to an enthusiastic, studio audience (some of these introductions amount to stand-up routines), and then the madness begins. Among the many highlights from the 13 episodes on this boxed set's three discs is a mock ad for Samuel L. Jackson beer, featuring Chappelle's hilarious impression of Jackson's stern, overbearing persona fromPulp Fiction, and a dozen other features. Chappelle, considering a career in politics, floats a couple of trial campaign commercials, including one that promises to solve America's health care crisis by giving every citizen a fake Canadian I.D. Chappelle also suggests an effective program for teaching sexual abstinence to high school students: Forcing them to watch their principals have sex with the oldest female teachers on staff.There's a good bit, too, about black soothsayer Negrodamus, whose ability to foresee events is limited to the fortunes of celebrities. Coming under fire (amusingly) are those McDonald's commercials suggesting that burger-flipping employment for African Americans can overhaul inner city communities. But, as with season 1, there are several masterpieces in this collection as well, such as Chappelle's vision of what the Internet would look like if it was a place you could actually, physically visit (with the equivalents of pop-up ads, porn sites, etc.). Equally inspired is a sketch in which a freeloading Chappelle, having impregnated the ultra-rich Oprah Winfrey, indulges his every whim. Best of all is Chappelle's take on what President Bush's administration would look like if the Chief Executive were, in fact, a black man.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00018YCIM", "B000FZETIE", "B000095J1K", "B000O59A2A", "B0009VRHLU", "B000FMH8RG", "B0016KCCCM", "B0036TGTEI", "B0006HBZE2", "B000F8O2QK", "B000CNESLM", "B008FRJDVC", "B000H6SY32", "B000LV6VYW", "B0008KLV96", "B008F282QO", "1558908390", "B0041QSZS8", "B000EMGJAO", "B001DJLD0S", "B002XUBDXS", "B002OOK6WM", "B000F48D14", "B00AEFYE08", "B0001XAODE", "B00008PHCU", "B002LCOGBE", "B0006N2F04", "B004P7CMZ0", "B00005JLG1", "B000P5FH5S", "B00ANDDBBY", "B000UAE7Q8", "B00AMSM9AO", "B000AJJNI6", "B00024JC4E", "B0056EBHEI", "B000GPIPTM", "0783237367", "B000CNESM6", "B0000YEE6M", "B004SIP6LS", "B001EOQVA4", "0767830555", "B001HB1K0A", "B00023P49C", "B004SIP93S", "B002N1AEWS", "B000FFJYC0", "B008FXLZ6W", "B002C7ELWC", "B000EBGFPY", "B0019L0ACM", "B00J5LXPPM", "B000OIOOVE", "B001O0TWXG", "B000022TSW", "B002N5N5NE", "B0018BDDF4", "B00006HAVX", "B002OID4WM", "B00BTYPWDQ", "B00005JNEQ", "B000BITV9W", "B001J4E1C4", "B0008JIJ1A", "B00BTYFWEA", "B002CA68N4", "B000ENUYGI", "0792838076", "B001J9KJ4I", "B000B5XOR0", "B0016LFG4M", "B008412UQ4", "B0006Z2L2Y", "B000RPD0DC", "B001BGS17G", "B00023P49M", "B0018O5WUU", "B000084T18", "B0021TVYCG", "630514415X", "B000WZEZGI", "B000C20VRS", "B0030Y11UG", "B0001ZWLVU", "B006W93ELK", "B00005JLEX", "B00005N89M", "B00005JD5H", "B000ADWCYY", "B0000A98ZO", "B004SIP9E2", "B0002UE1WQ", "B000WPNL8Q", "B00AIANIPQ", "B000FSME2Y", "B0025X4PBK", "B0000696I2"], "bought_together": ["B00018YCIM", "B000FZETIE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B008FRJDVC", "B00018YCIM", "B000O59A2A", "B000FZETIE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 16600}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 10.75, "brand": "Paramount", "asin": "B0006Q93CO", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51B5Z142P1L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Chappelle's Show - Season 2"}

Not a happy place, obviously, and it gets worse when both men realize that they've been chained and pitted against one another by an unseen but apparently omniscient maniac who's screwing with their psyches as payment for past sins. Director James Wan, who concocted this grimy distraction with screenwriter Whannell, has seenSevenand any number of other arty existential-psycho-cat-and-mouse thrillers, so he's providedSawwith a little flash, a little blood, and a lot of ways to distract you from the fact that it doesn't make a whole hell of a lot of sense. Wan and Whannell (who's not the most accomplished actor, either) pile on the plot twists, which after some initially novel ideas become increasingly juvenile. Elwes works hard but looks embarrassed, and the estimable Danny Glover suffers as the obsessed detective on the case.

{"description": "By getting nominated for Academy Awards in both the Foreign Language Film and Best Song categories,Les Choristes(The Chorus) made a rare (for a European film) double impression at the 2004 Oscars. This sentimental tale follows the arrival of a new teacher at a remote boys school in 1949 France (the war is a largely unspoken but ghostly presence). With disciplinary problems rampant, and the policies of the old-fashioned headmaster not helping, Monsieur Mathieu decides to introduce choral singing as a way to bridge the gap with his students. You don't need a crystal ball to figure out where this will go, although the movie uses its atmospheric location and lush vocal arrangements well. Bald, dumpy Gerard Jugnot provides a refreshingly offbeat hero (though securely in the traditions of the My Most Memorable Teacher movie); he's sort of a younger Philippe Noiret. Director Christophe Barratier works in the winsome-cute mode that makes a certain kind of French movie into an overly sweet bon bon, although at least this bon bon sings.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00421IR5I", "B002AG2NTI", "B001THZAAI", "B0002S64SM", "B0087IT8FK", "B008A6QBZO", "B0009P7EI2", "B000296E7W", "B0009NSAF0", "B001AZJKKK", "B0069UV0AY", "B000I6BJ56", "B009CSVQ8Q", "B007I1Q59E", "B001CIOCLC", "B0000C9JFO", "B004SEUIXS", "B005V4X8PO", "B000YPUFBA", "B0000A1HQP", "B002LE8MGW", "B000UAE7MM", "B005HISOJ4", "B00005JPX8", "B000B58DHQ", "B004Y2SDX6", "B0000YEENU", "B00005JM48", "B0084O26SI", "B0007OMJPI", "B002W1HBM0", "B000SSQ7JC", "B00005OSLQ", "B004B3254Q", "B0089MUDM6", "B005CKW8BM", "B0007Z9QSA", "B000UVV26A", "B008H1Q3QY", "B0012Z361M", "B0002TSZMO", "B000I0RNV6", "B004YCKKIM", "B000053VBR", "B0049BKOIY", "B004ZBFRRG", "B0007Z0NYQ", "B004GFGUAE", "B0007A61K6", "B00L16P1I8", "B00AIBZLHS", "B000HIVIQU", "B00A92MEJY", "B00DNB1OSU", "B002VKB0M4", "B00ENMZK1A", "B002AG2NV6", "B00007J5VT", "B000MTEFP0", "B0002RQ316", "B000053VBN", "B003Y7D7BU", "B009NP1ZVG", "B000CSUNRU", "B0045NXMMQ", "B003H0ZHGM", "B0036TGSJE", "B0001BMLUA", "B002SF9YNO", "B00447851Q", "B004XVMCGW", "B0001IN0MQ", "B004UXUUDA", "B001APM44O", "B0009PBLU4", "B000YAA68W", "B00023GG6C", "B00G15MDI0", "B002AG2NU2", "0156013983", "B000HRMCUM", "B00782O7IY", "B001CQS7M4", "B00AWHDFLW", "B00005N89H", "B004JNZGFI", "B00F6SHGF8", "B00007KK52", "B00AEFY9RG", "B0019APR80", "B005S9EK5Y", "B000065R0U", "B008KQVGEU", "B00ATK0452", "B0019UGYAU", "B004ZG5EYC", "B00CXI8HMK", "B004SUDQ2W", "6305428352"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00421IR5I", "B001THZAAI", "B0087IT8FK", "B0002S64SM"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 72019}, "asin": "B0007NMJPO", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61HKVBYA0WL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Chorus (Les Choristes)"}

{"description": "The film is set in France near the end of World War I in the deadly trenches of the Somme, in the gilded Parisien halls of power, and in the modest home of an indomitable provincial girl. It tells the story of this young woman's relentless, moving and sometimes comic search for her fiancC)e, who has disappeared. He is one of five French soldiers believed to have been court-martialed under mysterious circumstances and pushed out of an allied trench into an almost-certain death in no-man's land. What follows is an investigation into the arbitrary nature of secrecy, the absurdity of war, and the enduring passion, intuition and tenacity of the human heart.DVD Features:Audio CommentaryDeleted Scenes:With Director audio commentaryDocumentaries:Paris in the 20'sThe Zepplin ExplosionFeaturette:The Making of A Very Long EngagementTheatrical Trailer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001CIOCLC", "B0045NXMJE", "B004YCKKH8", "B000934FC2", "B00000K3TS", "B004SEUIXS", "B008H1Q3QY", "B00005JM48", "B002LE8MGW", "B00005JPX8", "B0000C9JFO", "B002VKB0M4", "B00EMAGJ68", "B000UVV26A", "B001THZAAI", "B0069UV0AY", "B000YPUFBA", "B002AG2NTI", "B0045NXMMQ", "B0087IT8FK", "B001AZJKKK", "B004ZG5EYC", "B000B58DHQ", "B00421IR5I", "B005V4X8PO", "B000063K0U", "B00BTYJYR6", "B007I1Q59E", "B000I6BJ56", "B00000F7E6", "B00A92MEJY", "B0042FDCR2", "B000HIVIQU", "B009CSVQ8Q", "B000811672", "0312424582", "B0019UGYAU", "B0009P7EI2", "B00275EHVE", "B005E7SEK2", "B00EV1YZKK", "B004B3254Q", "B002BWP3UC", "B003VA3JTA", "B001M72J68", "B0002S64SM", "B000GBEWP2", "B0080QOL6A", "B000BB18WC", "B000OVLBGC", "B009B8YMB0", "B0036TGSJE", "B000LW7L2M", "B00DPJEWDO", "0792841409", "B00GS08Y3Q", "B000B9EYFW", "B0002ZMJD4", "B00068S3QY", "B00K0MM4AM", "B004YCKKIM", "B000SSQ7JC", "B0051HCVEU", "B005MYEQ4U", "B00005B1WH", "B00003CWTI", "B001JV5BA8", "B0031REQKE", "B00007J5VT", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B003J7HO6E", "B00GPPXNIK", "B002WY65VA", "B004XVMCG2", "B000YDMPAQ", "B00EV1YZQE", "B004SIP6BI", "B000HWZ4I4", "B00AZNEVNE", "B0001I54QQ", "B001CITQWC", "B00AZNEVJ8", "B00GX7WUD4", "B000KGGJ0Y", "B000H5V8H2", "B00ARX2VZW", "B00INUK5WM", "B00009OOFG", "B00F6SHGF8", "B00ENMZK1A", "B0011FDVGI", "B009TT0BSE", "B000CBG5PG", "B0014FAIZC", "B0046YK4KW", "B000N3T0DW", "B004EI2NUO", "B00003CXXY", "B004UXUUDA", "B002U1LGSW"], "bought_together": ["B001CIOCLC", "B004SEUIXS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001CIOCLC", "B004SEUIXS", "B0000C9JFO", "B00005JPX8"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 18840}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.74, "brand": "Warner Brothers", "asin": "B0007Z0NYQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51uMf%2BoLZPL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "A Very Long Engagement"}

Ashkenazi is charismatic and subtle; his bedroom eyes and understated smolder make him something of an Israeli Clive Owen.

{"description": "Mary McGuckian (This is the Sea) has produced a handsome, if curiously inert version of Thornton Wilder's Pulitzer Prize-winning novella. While the story presents a compelling inquiry into the nature of fate, this fourth adaptation, after a 1944 movie and 1958 tele-film, never quite overcomes some odd casting decisions. Set in Lima, Peru in the early-1700s, the story concerns the inquiry by Brother Juniper (Gabriel Byrne) into the deaths of five travelers who drowned when the bridge they were crossing collapsed. Was it divine intervention or random chance? As Juniper tells the Archbishop (Robert De Niro, making no effort to disguise his New York accent), while on trial for heresy, \"Either we live by accident and die by accident or we live by plan and die by plan.\" Using his trial as a framing device, McGuckian flashes back to the circumstances that led the victims to their date with destiny. The primary players include the Viceroy (F. Murray Abraham), La Marquesa (Kathy Bates), the Abbess (Geraldine Chaplin), Uncle Pio (Harvey Keitel), La Perichole (Pilar L&#xF3;pez de Ayala), and twins Manuel and Esteban (Mark and Michael Polish ofNorthforkfame). So who fell? Unlike previous productions, the answer won't be revealed until the end, at which point Juniper will be forced to put his findings into a theological context--or suffer the cost.--Kathleen C.

{"description": "How is it possible that11:14went virtually unreleased in theaters? After modest film-festival exposure, it played briefly in San Francisco in August 2005 (over two years after it was completed), but that's a cruel twist of fate for such a cleverly twisted movie about cruel twists of fate. Destined for sleeper status on DVD (and given a slightly higher profile by Hilary Swank's subsequent Oscar-winning performance inMillion Dollar Baby), the audacious debut of writer-director Greg Marcks boasts a fantastic cast in a smartly constructed comedy/thriller, partly inspired byBlood Simple, in which a fatal traffic accident is examined and re-examined from multiple perspectives. The flashback structure involves all of the characters and events that lead up to the accident's deadly occurrence at 11:14 on an otherwise pleasant evening in Middleton, a typical suburb of Anytown, USA (filmed in the vicinity of Los Angeles). Marcks's screenplay attracted an impressive ensemble cast (costar Swank also signed on as an executive producer), and they're all given equal time as the intertwined plots are revealed. They include Rachael Leigh Cook (whose bad-girl behavior sets the chain of events in motion); Patrick Swayze and Barbara Hershey as her worried parents; Swank and Shawn Hatosy as would-be criminals with a dimwit plan; Henry Thomas as a drunk driver whose involvement is deeper than we realize; and Colin Hanks as one of three teenage vandals on a fast track to trouble. With falling corpses, graveyard sex, reckless gunplay, and a severed penis, it's all in good, grisly fun (apart from intricate plotting, Marcks has no lofty agenda up his sleeve), and there's ultimately not much point to its random misfortune, but11:14is clearly the work of a promising filmmaker, worthy of rediscovery on DVD. Bonus features include Marcks's intelligent commentary, a standard behind-the-scenes featurette, and a useful \"character jump\" feature allowing viewers to choose a plot trajectory whenever one character encounters another.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0040J1RX6", "B0014Z4OKW", "6305720134", "B001URA5Y8", "B000BBOUUE", "B00008L3TK", "B003U6SJY0", "B004SUDQAE", "B0034JKYSC", "B0002J58GU", "B002NALPFO", "B0009ML2UG", "B0016MJ6WE", "B0000996F3", "B004QXJZY4", "B001AIQ14A", "B00000F8KW", "6305133409", "B001C5LLVE", "B002PQ1PBA", "B004RE29WM", "B000CQQIDU", "B0001BRSRG", "B000MTFFO0", "B0000639HN", "B000CQLZ0Q", "B000GI3KGM", "B00AEBB86U", "0783228686", "B001CRC4DG", "B00HOGBXS6", "B001U0HB5Q", "B006GVN05O", "B00112S8RS", "B0009S4IG0", "B00BNH9NCU", "B000PISZ7W", "B001B73Q20", "B007UW9WMS", "B000GDH9NM", "B003EYVXTG", "B00004WI53", "B0000AC8LR", "B0082CWTSY", "B008PUI1GM", "B000FFJ826", "0767835093", "B000MGUZCU", "B000FUTVLY", "B0002KQNMC", "B000E6ESL2", "B00DPUB56U", "B0034G4P30", "B009AMAJPA", "B00JPQ1I7O", "B005Z9MFCM", "B00005YUPD", "B004EC5ITI", "B0031U8OEK", "B003AWRM9M", "B001AK3S4O", "B002S5N052", "B00003CWN3", "B004O8OLO0", "B00I45844W", "B00IKM5MIA", "B001K98MG4", "B000MMMTBY", "B003IIST9U", "B001UDS4BS", "B00007AJE1", "B0083QN87K", "B00000IBL1", "B004EQAVA0", "B000KX0IOK", "B00275EGNS", "B00HF98SHG", "B0097C046W", "B000GB5M3S", "B00J5G1P2W", "B00005A3KS", "B00AEFXGIY", "B002UOMGYW", "B0011VIO3W", "B000PKG8TM", "B00A47BT7C", "0792838041", "B004SIP7VM", "B000A3XY5A", "B00008EY9G", "B0001FGBSE", "B001MVYUR0", "B0030E5NJ6", "B007549W62", "B00000F35Z", "B005Z9MGRG", "B000HC2M0C", "B00005JH9M", "B003498SCQ", "B000GI3KGC"], "bought_together": ["B0040J1RX6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["6305133409", "B0034JKYSC", "B0040J1RX6", "B000FI8MPW"]}, "price": 5.0, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 75977}, "asin": "B000ALM40I", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516T38H2WQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "11:14"}
{"description": "A decade after their last hilarious short, the Oscar-winning A Close Shave, Claymation wonders Wallace and Gromit return for a full-length adventure. Daffy scientist Wallace (voiced by Peter Sallis) and his heroic dog Gromit are doing well with their business, Anti-Pesto, a varmint-hunting outfit designed to keep their English town safe from rabbits chomping on prized vegetables. Wallace meets Lady Tottington (Helena Bonham Carter), who appreciates Wallace's humane way of dealing with rabbits (courtesy of the Bun-Vac 6000), and sets up a rivalry with the gun-toting Victor Quartermaine (Ralph Fiennes, enjoying himself more than ever). Creator Nick Park, with co-director/writer Steve Box, delivers a story worthy of the 85-minute running time, although it stretches the act a bit; the formula plays better shorter, but the literally hand-crafted film is a joy to watch. Taking a chapter from classic horror films, a giant were-rabbit is soon on the prowl, and the town is up in arms, what with the annual vegetable contest close at hand. (Anyone who's seen the previous three shorts knows who saves the day.) Never content to do something simply when the extravagant will do, W&G;'s lives are filled with whimsical Rude Goldberg-style devices, and the opening number showcasing their alarm system is pure Aardman Animation at its finest.

{"description": "With Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson as a pair of brazen wedding crashers, this buddy/romantic comedy milks a few big laughs from its foolproof premise. Under the direction of David Dobkin (who previously worked with Wilson onShanghai Knights), the movie ranges from bawdy romp to mushy romance, and that tonal identity crisis curtails the overall hilarity. But when the well-teamed costars are firing on all pistons with fast-paced dialogue and manic situations, belly laughs are delivered at a steady clip. Things get complicated when the guys infiltrate the family of the Treasury Secretary (Christopher Walken), resulting in a romantic pair-off between Vaughn and the congressman's oversexed daughter Gloria (Isla Fisher) while Wilson sincerely woos another daughter, Claire (Rachel McAdams), who's unhappily engaged to an Ivy League cheater (Bradley Cooper). Walken is more or less wasted in his role, but Jane Seymour and Henry Gibson make amusing appearances, and a surprise guest arrives late in the game for some over-the-top scene-stealing. It's all a bit uneven, but McAdams (considered by some to be \"the next Julia Roberts\") is a pure delight, and with enough laughs to make it easily recommended,Wedding Crasherswill likely find its place on DVD shelves alongside other flawed but enjoyable R-rated comedies that embrace a naughtier, nastier brand of humor with no need for apologies.--Jeff ShannonVince Vaughn's MoviesWhy We Love Rachel McAdamsOwen Wilson's MoviesThe SoundtrackThe Return of Crass ComedyThe 40-Year-Old Virgin", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEFYS2M", "B000ELJAEM", "B00466HN7M", "B008R65XNS", "B00005JNZU", "B00006FMUW", "B000J4P9P8", "B002ZGW92E", "B001G5T6GW", "B000WZEZGI", "B002Q4VBPQ", "B00003CXSM", "B001TUZD8O", "B000HCPS94", "B001C0JCBA", "B0009HBPN0", "B001OD4S50", "B00005JMYI", "B00005JG6N", "B004EPZ084", "B0015I2RT8", "B00AEFYAMA", "B00AEBB8NS", "B00AEFXJS6", "B000069CF0", "B000TZJBPQ", "B00003CXO1", "B001C5LLQ4", "B0009OL7Z4", "B0007RT9M6", "B00005JMW7", "B001J9KJ4I", "B0006GANPA", "B003Y5H574", "B000BKJ762", "B000E6EHE0", "B003Y5H524", "B000ICM5X0", "B00AEFY7I2", "B002K0WBXW", "B00AEBB9K0", "B000VXWX7E", "B0013D8LHC", "B004HO6I2E", "B001DPHDB0", "B0016MOV92", "B00AEFYM2S", "B004EPZ070", "B000JJ4DNW", "B003CRM6PA", "B00BEIYMZ6", "B008R65XMO", "B00005JMX6", "B00AEBBA2C", "B004EPZ06G", "B004EPYZS0", "B003Y5H5B0", "B00024JC4E", "B0000AKCKI", "B000957O82", "B00AEFYQE2", "B00DV2MVWO", "B00AEBB8FQ", "B001L9EXTS", "B0041KKYGU", "B00AEFZ3XU", "B002U4UYZA", "B000CPH9PM", "B000EMGJAO", "B000M341QE", "B008R65XUQ", "B00005JMCT", "B001AKTZW8", "B00008WJD6", "B00AEFYSL8", "B002P413IC", "B00AEFXVW0", "B002ZG99H2", "B0000A02TZ", "B005LAII12", "B001SN78JO", "B008JFUORW", "B000LC3ICE", "B002T9H2LA", "B0051MKNRC", "B003HKN52U", "B000CCBCAS", "B00AEFYZCU", "B002ZG980U", "B00AEFY99O", "B002VWNIEA", "B0000524E5", "B004AV5GX6", "B000A343RI", "B000EMGJ7C", "B004LWZW5G", "B00AEFXDO6", "B00000K3UU", "B004SIP95G", "B0009RCPUW"], "bought_together": ["B00AEFYS2M"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00466HN7M", "B001G5T6GW", "B003Y5H5B0", "B000J4P9P8"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 92528}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.95, "brand": "New Line Home Video", "asin": "B000BKVQRU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Z2E7093FL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Wedding Crashers (R-Rated Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "Rent, the show that in 1996 gave voice to a Broadway generation, has finally become an energetic, passionate, and touching movie musical. Based loosely on Puccini'sLa Boh&#xE8;me, it focuses on the year in the life of a group of friends in New York's East Village--\"bohemians\" who live carefree lives of art, music, sex, and drugs. Well, carefree until Mark, an aspiring filmmaker (Anthony Rapp), and Roger, an aspiring songwriter (Adam Pascal), find out they owe a year's rent to Benny (Taye Diggs), a former friend who had promised them free residence when he married the landlord's daughter. Roger has also attracted the attention of his downstairs neighbor, Mimi (Rosario Dawson), while Mark's former girlfriend, Maureen (Idina Menzel), has found a new romance in a lawyer named Joanne (Tracie Thoms). Philosophy professor Tom (Jesse L. Martin) finds his soul mate in drag queen Angel (Wilson Jermaine Heredia). But because this is the late-'80s, the threat of AIDS is always present.The remarkable thing aboutRentthe movie is that nearly 10 years after the show debuted onBroadway, six of the eight principals return in the roles they originated. They're a bit older than would be ideal for their characters, but they do have the advantage of having learned the show directly from creator Jonathan Larson (who died of an aortic aneurysm while the show was in previews), plus they started young--we're not exactly talking Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford here.  Alongside a polished performance like Rapp's--sometimes observer-commentator, sometimes participant in two of the score's showstoppers, \"The Tango Maureen\" and \"La Vie Boheme\"--the two new additions (Thoms in place of Fredi Walker, Dawson in place of the edgier Daphne Rubin-Vega) slip comfortably into the ensemble; the pivotal Dawson makes a seductive case as Mimi when she tempts Roger in the mesmerizing \"Light My Candle\" or burns up the stage of the Catscratch Club in \"Out Tonight.\"  Moviegoers who have an aversion to people who break into song while walking down the street probably won't have their minds changed byRent(even if they are singingrocksongs), and the gritty subject matter and lack of big-name stars make it unlikely to cross over to general audiences the wayChicagodid.  But fans of musicals should find \"Seasons of Love\" as stirring as ever, and the show's passionate admirers--the \"Rentheads\"--probably couldn't have wished for a more sympathetic director thanRentfan Chris Columbus, or a more faithful representation of the show they love.--David HoriuchiOn the DVDThree powerful musical numbers cut from the final film are the highlight of the two-disc DVD.  In the aftermath of the funeral scene, Anthony Rapp sings \"Halloween,\" and he, Adam Pascal, and Rosario Dawson share \"Goodbye Love\" (both songs were in the stage version). Then in an alternate ending, the cast finishes \"No Day But Today\" on the bare stage on which the film began.  There are worthwhile arguments for why these scenes were cut or replaced, so it's fortunate that the DVD lets us see these at all.  Those musical numbers have optional commentary by director Chris Columbus, Rapp, and Pascal (two other cut scenes have no commentary), including one funny moment in which Rapp explains in great detail the technical challenge of shooting \"Halloween\" only to have Columbus say, \"Yeah, but I don't know if that's the take we used.\"  The three also provide commentary on the film itself, with Columbus discussing various decisions, criticizing the critics, and marveling \"I still don't know how we got the PG-13,\" and Rapp and Pascal occasionally recalling differences in the stage version.The other whopper of a feature isNo Day But Today, a nearly two-hour documentary that uses video clips, still photographs, and interviews with family and friends to celebrate the short life of Jonathan Larson and his creation.  Topics include his early interest in musical theater (\"I want to write theHairfor the '90s.\"), the support of Stephen Sondheim, the impact of the AIDS epidemic, the long and difficult road ofRent(casting the show, Larson learning to collaborate, the transfer to a Broadway stage, and the Rentheads), and Larson's tragic death. The last 20 minutes covers the making of the film, director Chris Columbus, the decision to rely on most of the original cast (the only two principals who didn't appear in the movie, Daphne Rubin-Vega and Fredi Walker-Browne, are interviewed in earlier segments, but only mentioned in passing here), recording sessions, and location shooting.  If the movie ofRentwas a tribute to Jonathan Larson, the DVD is all that and more, a moving and incredibly detailed look at an extraordinary talent whom the world lost far too soon.--David HoriuchiMoreRentMovie soundtrackOriginal Broadway cast recordingAnthony Rapp'sWithout You: A Memoir of Love, Loss, and the Musical \"Rent\"", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001LMAKAG", "B000AYEI4U", "B006ZZQMXS", "B000005ALT", "B004SEUJBE", "B0007TKNII", "B000077VR3", "B002D0L0R2", "0688154379", "B00AEBBAEK", "B000Z8R2VW", "B002G1K82Q", "B00GM7ZFAA", "B00JAOW3MA", "B00006D295", "B005S9EK5Y", "B0028SVXVM", "B00004XMTJ", "B001MT7ZEW", "B001GKJ2DY", "B006Z21ZFG", "6304806418", "0743269772", "B0000AM6IY", "B0000TB01Y", "B00070HK24", "B002NZK5TG", "B002ZG976U", "B00AEFY5TI", "B000EWBKMG", "B00008973A", "1423406265", "B00AEFXTKO", "B0013Z7RUC", "B00004W5VC", "B00GTO6WXU", "B000I2J6YG", "B000RPCK2E", "0800141806", "0743269764", "B00028HBIO", "0783240287", "B0007WFXZI", "0792841638", "B005QIOKBQ", "1938438175", "B005SFR7YE", "B003L77GAQ", "B001FB55OE", "B000E3LHSM", "B00001PE59", "0767827929", "B000J3OTSM", "B000UAE7NG", "B005LAIHR2", "B009NYF2GQ", "B00005JOFQ", "B002ZG99IG", "B0000VCZKM", "B00005O3VD", "B001HN69AY", "B000FIHN5M", "B0011U52E2", "B0000524E5", "B003H6Z0PO", "B006WZIB1C", "B004D9FLJE", "0061350966", "B0053O8A5K", "B001CTA1UM", "B00G5G7EXY", "B00133KFGW", "B000URDCC6", "B001LMAKAQ", "B0009JE57G", "B009LDD5E0", "B00003CYJ4", "B00001PE4D", "B005PTMPYA", "B00005OCMS", "B004VJJFDE", "B00003CXHG", "B00447L4KA", "B0002E5O9G", "B0009IOR6Q", "B001FAFO3W", "B005BUA1HQ", "B00C81AVNU", "B00004RF9K", "B00166UFSY", "B002D0L0QS", "B00AMEZDJW", "B00006RIO7", "B00FGEO7OK", "B000683VI4", "B001JV5BF8", "B00005UQ9W", "B00GB0ORJ8"], "bought_together": ["B001LMAKAG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001LMAKAG", "B000077VR3", "B004SEUIWO", "B005SFR7YE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 7679}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.86, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B000E1YVZU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61ZTKXS4AGL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Rent (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition)"}

{"description": "The DVD Holy Grail for Liza Minnelli fans finally surfaces after 30-some years:Liza with a \"Z\", a splashy TV special from 1972. And wow, is it ever a product of its era. Minnelli and director-choreographer Bob Fosse were at the top of their popularity in 1972, having just madeCabaret, the blockbuster musical for which both won Oscars.Liza with a \"Z\"places the still-coltish Minnelli on the stage of the Lyceum Theater, in a one-night-only performance covered by Fosse's eight cameras. Songs byCabaretcomposers John Kander and Fred Ebb provide a spine for the show, including a breathless rendition of \"Ring Them Bells\" and the tongue-twisting \"Say Liza (Liza with a 'Z'),\" a goofball number that sounds more like one of Danny Kaye's patter songs than a tune for Liza Minnelli.Liza treats each song as an emotional Mount Everest, never holding back a thing, and the result is a psychodrama played out in the klieg lights. (The outrageous costumes by Halston don't hold back a thing, either; Studio 54, here we come!) Memories of the all-or-nothing style of her mother, Judy Garland, are already heavy in the air by the time Minnelli reaches \"My Mammy,\" and workouts on \"God Bless the Child\" and \"Son of a Preacher Man\" confirm the singer's approach.As for Fosse's choreography, there are signature moves aplenty--his dancing so frequently suggested a choreographer lusting for actual sex to break out on stage. \"Bye Bye Blackbird\" gives Minnelli and her backup dancers a chance to stretch out in an echt-Fosse feast of bowler hats and white gloves. The bell-and-booty shaking in \"Ring Them Bells\" and the loony tuxedo-clad cowpokes in \"I Gotcha\" hint that Fosse was in the midst of a manic phase. Speaking of which, Minnelli tackling Joe Tex's \"I Gotcha\" is one of those jaw-dropping mismatches that she salvages only through dint of daft commitment. No quarreling with theCabaretmedley; say want you want about Liza, she owns those songs. Minnelli and Fosse won Emmys for the show. The restoration of the original materials looks about as good as can be expected, with the spirit of a glitzy seventies TV variety special quite intact.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000H7JCIW", "B009NYF2GQ", "B00007J5VN", "B0000714B8", "B002WHQ9XG", "B00003CX8U", "B000WC39ZY", "B00004W5VC", "B00005UQ8F", "B007LYAYNQ", "B008NNSCYM", "0547553293", "B000EF5MPY", "B009NYF2ES", "B00K6D1S7A", "B000003D64", "B00005U8QP", "B0000714B9", "B0012GMWYI", "B000JGWD32", "B000BP86QY", "B000059QY9", "B002Y4Z54Q", "B000005KOH", "B0001AW07U", "B00KO76FSA", "B003B3V0X4", "B003F1SSG4", "B008SBXFUU", "B001MBTSTA", "B00IZIGFNU", "B00KE3B6NI", "B0000714B6", "B00005JNIU", "B000000PG1", "B008FYZHDS", "B00GBT6364", "B00JM5CAHA", "B000RPBGLA", "B0002OXVDW", "B0033AI4PM", "6305161895", "B00005V9HM", "B00IXD2N1K", "B0000714BA", "B00J2AU8MY", "B002BI4JKG", "B001NKWLD0", "B00J2T18MY", "B000B9PW7G", "B00005U120", "B00452J596", "B00JK5C46E", "B000649YA2", "B00AMQGGSW", "B00H7T56IS", "B008FYZIEQ", "B00BG4R8SG", "B007OAAK0O", "B00H3UKZ6E", "B0032KNA3Y", "B00IBQ5M1W", "B0002Y4TII", "B00BDSRB2S", "B00FN3HRG4", "B000059H73", "B0000BZNDK", "B00GXD6UNO", "B00CQUNSJM", "B004SEUJBE", "B003NF97IU", "B0041FQWF2", "B00000HZFP", "B0062Z0PLG", "B004VJJFDE", "B000056WR0", "B0007WFXZI", "B001G5IJZG", "B004AR4W4O", "B00G0RTYK4", "B000IOM0S8", "B00GXD6UMK", "B0009XFIR8", "B005ZVINFS", "B001LMAKAG", "B0001FR54I", "B003GH6M2O", "B00004RFEZ", "B00BUQV728", "B009Z59782", "0306812843", "B002JT69LE", "6302289033", "B000FG65RQ", "B0081NASLY", "B000007QGL", "B00J2PQZEY", "B000228EGS", "B00FBDJE8K", "B000001E3D"], "bought_together": ["B000H7JCIW", "B009NYF2GQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B009NYF2GQ", "B000H7JCIW", "B0012GMWYI", "B00007J5VN"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 86765}, "categories": [["CDs & Vinyl", "Pop", "Dance Pop"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Pop", "Oldies", "Traditional Pop"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Pop", "Vocal Pop"], ["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 15.99, "brand": "Paramount Pictures", "asin": "B000EBFLHC", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61QQKWVTG2L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Liza With A &quot;Z&quot;"}
{"description": "Any fan of Steve Martin's2000 novellawill enjoy this pitch-perfect adaptation, which glowingly captures the bittersweet tones of a May-December romance. Martin wrote the screenplay and stars as Ray Porter, a button-down 50-something executive who reaches out to a much younger woman as a Los Angeles playmate. The book and movie, though, are both primarily about Mirabelle (Claire Danes), a 20-something with a pile of promises, debt, and depression, as she fades away into a slow corner of Saks selling unneeded formal gloves. She's a wisp of a person, with a cat who doesn&#x92;t love her, and when she finds a suitor, it's Jeremy (Jason Schwartzman), a scruffy artist who babbles on about speakers. When the gentlemanly Porter calls, his appearance in her life begins to make her whole. It also immediately sets her up for sadness--Ray thinks of Mirabella as a precious outlet for sex, while Mirabelle, very mistakenly, sees Ray as a potential lifelong mate. Martin deftly turns the novella's prose into dialogue, allowing the movie to feel full-bodied, and the film also works as a comedy, as we witness Jeremy's growth on the road with a rock band. Schwartzman would walk away with film if not for the perfectly cast leads: Martin does another smart turn away from his wild-and-crazy moniker, Danes has never been better in an Oscar-worthy performance, and Bridgette Wilson-Sampras aces her role as a hot-to-trot co-worker of Mirabelle's. Whoever's decision to have Martin be the omnipresent narrator, though, should be penalized, as it&#x92;s confusing to have him in two roles, and the information is pretty useless, even robbing the film of a final grace note.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000F5FNPC", "B000F6IODE", "B000BYY11Y", "B00079HZUM", "B00008979G", "B000V6LSOA", "B003BZ58RQ", "B005Z9MH7U", "B0012BR8DI", "B0000797IO", "B000VY1EYG", "0786891076", "B000062WWZ", "B00081U7HC", "B00005JMJ4", "B004499LX0", "B00B9ZD73M", "B0016MJ6HY", "B0064MT1FI", "B000EQHXNW", "0767818105", "B00005JMWP", "B000BX8R10", "B0038N9WKU", "B000056BSJ", "1419897543", "B00ADRYCWC", "B004L3AR0K", "B002ONC9NC", "0783227353", "B000NIVJFY", "B00IKM5OCO", "B005Z9MGRG", "6305428239", "B0002KPIQY", "B000CNESJO", "B000035Z3C", "B000EDWKXI", "B0010X8NF0", "078322740X", "B000053VB5", "B00AEFY8MM", "B00007JXWX", "B00FZ4KR4U", "B000BBOUUE", "B001UV4XGU", "0786866586", "B000IU37SO", "0783229402", "B0071HPP3M", "B00IXD2LJY", "B000ADWDFC", "B000GFRI54", "B0000640VJ", "6305308802", "B000067J1O", "B004XVMCKS", "B002T51X4Q", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B0001Z4P2I", "B004XVMCK8", "B000B8QG22", "B003Z8ZC2A", "B001KP2J2G", "B004D45NYC", "B00005JMBQ", "B00AEBB8P6", "B00005JL7Q", "B00007AJE1", "B00BMKGZVA", "B00BEIYGK2", "B000CS45TW", "B00005JMJD", "B00005KHJJ", "B00319ECBK", "B0068MNO2U", "B004LWZWBU", "B0013D8LCC", "B004GJYRA0", "B000LXHK2C", "B002O3Z4ZW", "B001P3SA8K", "B003Y5H574", "B000T988I8", "B002ZFEQ76", "B001URA5Y8", "B002ZG99UE", "B00G3DA5XA", "0767815122", "B001UV4XUG", "B00AEBB9G4", "B00FWSWIUU", "B0001O3YV2", "B00AADAEBW", "B00008972P", "B001MM3AZM", "B00AEFXJ86", "B00A18CG76", "B004H83IG4", "B00803PFWM"], "bought_together": ["B000F6IODE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0786866586", "B00079HZUM", "B007HW18CS", "B002WY65VA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 30533}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.45, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B000EDWKX8", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51vVNaGhmPL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Shopgirl"}

When the president is killed during his watch, Alex is wracked with guilt. Plucky investigative reporter Kate Crawford (Angie Harmon fromLaw & Order) convinces him that the gunman didn't act alone and that a conspiracy theory in this case is valid. Gooding plays his role with quiet reserve, a 180-degree departure from his over-the-top Oscar-winning performance inJerry Maguire. Harmon displays charm as the award-winning and highly unrealistic journalist. And Burt Reynolds shows up for a few minutes here and there to chew up the scenery as a general who may or may not be a rogue agent.

{"description": "No collection of classic TV Westerns is complete withoutCheyenne, the trailblazing 1955 series that premiered within weeks ofGunsmoke. The strapping Clint Walker stars as Cheyenne Bodie, the iconic role that earned him his place in the Hall of Great Western Performers at the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum in Oklahoma City. Cheyenne is a classic Western hero in the drifter tradition, accepting jobs ranging from frontier scout to trail boss. In this first season, he is accompanied at times by sidekick Smitty (L.Q. Jones). \"It takes about a minute to know a man,\" one character remarks during the course ofCheyenne's first season. But we size up Cheyenne in an instant. He is a man of honor, straight shooting and plainspoken. In one episode, he declines an offered position of ranch foreman. \"I don't like the job,\" he states, \"and when I don't like a job, I turn it down.\" When a woman refers to Indians as \"savages\" in the first episode, Cheyenne enlightens her, \"The Indians think we're the savages.\" Several episodes, including \"Quicksand\" and \"The Last Train West,\" echo the John Ford masterpiece,Stagecoach, as Cheyenne finds himself amongst a diverse and disparate group of people who are thrown together by circumstance.Cheyennewas part of a new breed of \"adult Western.\" The episode \"Johnny Bravo\" (was this the inspiration for Greg's rock star nom de plume onThe Brady Bunch?) deals with a rancher who disapproves of his daughter's affair with a Mexican. Keep a sharp lookout for actors who would later become Hollywood's most wanted. A pre-MaverickJames Garner appears as different characters in three episodes. Dennis Hopper is hot-triggered gunfighter the Utah Kid, in \"Quicksand.\" And that's the future Miss Hathaway, Nancy Kulp, as a sassy waitress in \"Johnny Bravo.\"Cheyennewas originally broadcast as one of three rotating series under the banner,Warner Brothers Presents, but it quickly established itself as the runaway hit. Like the best Westerns, it is anything but quaint nostalgia. With its timeless setting, compelling stories, charismatic hero, and positive values, the sun will never set onCheyenne.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000TQZBNQ", "B006W95BWA", "B009RNK0YC", "B00BR0SECI", "B00E8RVSZC", "B007AAF3FK", "B00GJT22VQ", "B005TZFYWA", "B000F9T70K", "B00668IFWA", "B00B00HUC0", "B000A0GXH4", "B005LVIP1E", "B003ZFXE82", "B00E96AY20", "B000EHSVB4", "B00AWWX7X8", "B000PHX5KU", "B00192BNJU", "B00KTZALDC", "B002DH20PQ", "B000VS6R3A", "B007RUZ29A", "B005UFUU6E", "B009RNK13M", "B004H0M34K", "B009V2KO9K", "B003VKVTL0", "B000NOIX7U", "B009OE2NS0", "B003BTO4HM", "B004L5GY82", "B00IU6HPIQ", "B000EOR0BY", "B0001JXQ2Y", "B006ZL1P84", "B00IS6WQ2S", "B004HHX9T6", "B00HQLZCIQ", "B00DOZNIVG", "B009OE2NZI", "B00G3BRCBU", "B004PQM81E", "B003552QUO", "B0002W4TVM", "B004IY1AVM", "B002XY5EAC", "B005D7E7Y0", "B00I1GUS0C", "B0064CT90U", "B00F6D62O4", "B00CL151ZU", "B00IP965IO", "B0025Y3SZS", "B007V4ETS2", "B00A6SZRT0", "B001JAHPMG", "B009DA74DY", "B000W8OM68", "B001E6JC1W", "B005PTYPK2", "B00CL151P0", "B007V973KI", "B00A2XQTFK", "B001MZVZGA", "B001072DFM", "B0013LRKVM", "B00BAXTY9O", "B005D7E7PY", "B001TWT0CW", "B00082ZROO", "B00A92MBIS", "B00BXTDVEO", "B009INAHZS", "B008OIQZ36", "B0013LRKY4", "B00BAXTYGW", "B00J9BZ4KC", "B00769U98Q", "B0055SJY86", "B00JEZWRE4", "B009ERK2UI", "B0083TUEDS", "B001E6HUXO", "B0006Z2L1A", "B004Q0VR5C", "B00AMDA2OY", "B0046S8MRU", "B00AX5B0RY", "B004T0XYLE", "B003XEKXYI", "B00A4Y614G", "B0008FXSSI", "B00H7BJ0WO", "B00H7BJ1I2", "B004GSVX8A", "B00CCYNYBO", "B0030Y12BE", "B0013D8M4E"], "bought_together": ["B000TQZBNQ", "B006W95BWA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000TQZBNQ", "B00E96AY20", "B00E8RVSZC", "B006W95BWA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 9392}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 11.49, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B000EQ46H8", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61u4edac2gL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Cheyenne - The Complete First Season"}
{"description": "In the flapper era, Clara Bow was theItgirl. In the liberated 1960s, Marlo Thomas was allThat. Her groundbreaking character, Ann Marie, opened the door for a new generation of independent women on TV who just might make it after all. Ann was not a wife, mother, daughter, girlfriend, ditzy neighbor, sidekick, or fantasy object (neither genie nor witch). She was something new and contemporary, an aspiring actress who leaves home to pursue her career in New York City. \"You did a wonderful job helping me grow up, but now I'm up,\" she sweetly tells her overprotective parents (an Emmy-worthy Lew Parker and Rosemary DeCamp) in \"Goodbye, Hello, Goodbye.\"That Girlwas not a total break from TV convention. In this inaugural season, she has a kinda kooky neighbor and Rhoda-antecedent, Judy (Bonnie Scott). And she has a boyfriend, magazine writer Donald Hollinger (Ted Bessell), whom she meets cute in the first aired episode, \"Don't Just Do Something, Stand There.\" Ann and Donald are one of TV's great comedy teams. They have a delightfulBarefoot in the Park-like chemistry, with Ann the vivacious, more free-spirited one, and Donald the more practical one. One of their best episodes is \"Anatomy of a Blunder,\" in which Donald suffers every disaster and indignity en route to meet Ann's father for the first time. Thomas was honored with a Golden Globe award for this season, and the series established her as \"talented, unusual, a bright new face\" (to quote the want ad Ann is desperate to answer in \"You Have to Know Someone to Be an Unknown\").One of the other kicks of reuniting withThat Girlis the stellar roster of veteran character actors and future stars. Dabney Coleman, Bernie Kopell (Get Smart,The Love Boat), and Ronnie Schell (Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.) are regulars this season. Guest stars include Sally Kellerman and George Carlin in \"Break a Leg,\" Rob Reiner and \"Terry\" Garr in \"This Little Piggy Had a Ball\" (the inevitable bowling-ball-stuck-on-the-toe episode), and a pre-All in the FamilyCarroll O'Connor as an amorous opera singer in \"A Tenor's Loving Care.\"That Girlis so-'60s, but as withThe Dick Van Dyke Show, on which series creators Sam Denoff and Bill Persky previously worked, the literate, character-driven comedy holds up remarkably well.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000H6SY28", "B000MQ4WMY", "B0019BI114", "B001O4KBP0", "B000E3L7EQ", "B00005JLIC", "B000EXZFS0", "B000G0O5J6", "B002ACKBU0", "B00JAD6BYW", "B000FSMEB0", "B001O4KBN2", "B00096S480", "B002C8YSBU", "B00005JOEB", "B003CNQPME", "B001D2WUCA", "B0077T5SBS", "B00G5N6C8U", "B00FM4S8IU", "B001E6JC30", "B0012Q3SZ0", "B000H1RFF0", "B0063FGERO", "B001SLNPSO", "B002JYPVS6", "B001D5C1F8", "B002JODUES", "B000EXDS02", "0788606344", "B000G6BL7O", "B000E6ES9Y", "B001D5C1EY", "B0009B16TO", "B0030BS1E8", "B000A9QKSM", "B000BOH8YQ", "B005R2SHX8", "B00JEEZTGI", "B0089BSLKS", "B00HJQMFF6", "B0025X4PBA", "B006363QHE", "B009GGWW3W", "B000ULM980", "B005NHZAXM", "B00KYCA4QY", "B00JDCP0QA", "B002OOWKVM", "B00DXLO0BI", "B00AADAEHQ", "B000LPR6AG", "B00H8KC1N4", "B0011N19HI", "B00FJO95TE", "B0096RC57O", "B00GV8B1BM", "B002OOWL16", "B001GMH8WE", "B00I458456", "B00DXLO086", "B00023P4RO", "B00KBES386", "B00DXLO0D6", "B002WN8IR0", "B0014FAIYS", "B007ZKWMMM", "B00GLT2SOA", "B003IRUFB6", "B000BXJ1Y2", "B000YKYT1M", "B003JHXS5A", "B00FFARI7I", "B000MGBSH6", "B004083REE", "B00274SIVK", "B00HUTB4SQ", "B000UX6TJ8", "B001B187C0", "B00005JO3P", "B00HRUQB5O", "B001992NXI", "B0007R4TR6", "B0028S1100", "B002AMVEHY", "B009P3J6D0", "B000B7HZUK", "B00GLPYVT4", "B00HW3LG3S", "B000B6CODY", "B000A0GXGK", "B000HEVZ7Q", "B008H1Q5FS", "B00HQLZCIQ", "B008K1PX7Q", "B0009NZMYC", "B002WIDRLC", "B000M343AI", "B000NJMJHA"], "bought_together": ["B000H6SY28", "B000MQ4WMY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0019BI114", "B001O4KBP0", "B000MQ4WMY", "B00DXLO086"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 38098}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 28.49, "brand": "Universal Music", "asin": "B000EQ5PTQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51uAMH0K4fL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "That Girl - Season One"}

{"description": "The title ofSlings and Arrows, like many of the themes and characters in this show, comes from Shakespeare&#x92;sHamlet. It refers to \"the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune\" that the Danish prince suffers, leading him to  question whether he is to be or not... you know. It&#x92;s a clever title for an inspired show about--what else?--the theatre. Set in the New Burbage Theatre Festival, a fictional Canadian Provincial theatre, a jaded, burnt-out artistic director, Oliver Welles (Stephen Ouimette), dies suddenly, and is replaced by a potential genius, his visionary prot&#xE9;g&#xE9; Geoffrey Tennant (Due South's Paul Gross). Geoffrey is legendary at the New Burbage for his awe-inspiring performance ofHamletthere years before, and also because he went mad and now his sanity seems to be hanging by a thread. And oh, by the way, Oliver&#x92;s still hanging around as a ghost, but Geoffrey&#x92;s the only one who can see him (sound familiar?), and his impulsive reactions and out-loud arguments with Oliver--including one captured while being interviewed for a news program--besides being hilarious, convince the cast and crews he&#x92;s really lost it. The show details the daily activities at the festival as they attempt to mount a new production ofHamlet(starring a movie star who&#x92;s all face and no talent), and in doing so it employs a huge cast of peripheral characters, including the dysfunctional acting company (rising star Rachel McAdams has a key part), scheming board members, and a neurotic theatre staff, each with their own little subplots interweaving to make one big drama.This first-season set of the Sundance Channel program contains only six episodes, which is too bad because the series is so excellent it&#x92;ll leave you wanting more. The fact that shows of this caliber are rare makes it stand out all the more. The writing is topnotch, with memorable dialogue, biting dark humor, and clever situations that continually point out how absurd real life can get. This one is a real gem, a show that demonstrates &#x91;tis nobler in the mind to laugh at the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, rather than suffer them.--Daniel Vancini", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000H5U5M6", "B000P2A2X8", "B000XUF6BU", "B000AP31KQ", "B00515J6RW", "B0017KP8Y0", "B001O4C6MQ", "B000A59PWY", "B000A0GY0K", "B004AV5H3U", "B001V7YZES", "B00HHYF55C", "B00D49YFAA", "B005ELEN26", "B002TY78PU", "B000BR9S96", "B00FPPQYXM", "B00GWXI20E", "B00005A1SY", "B00GWXI2RM", "B009D4SFEC", "B00006FDCT", "B00005JLCI", "B000Z27HLS", "B00E3UN44W", "B00123BY6S"], "bought_together": ["B000H5U5M6", "B000P2A2X8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000XUF6BU", "B00ECR7KX2", "B000H5U5M6", "B00515J6RW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 115999}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 19.96, "brand": "", "asin": "B000FBFYKU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51H2SSJWEBL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Slings &amp; Arrows - Season 1"}
{"description": "InThe Big White, a failing Alaskan travel agent hopes he's found the answer to his problems when a couple of thugs leave a dead body in a dumpster outside his business. The lack of a body has prevented Paul Barnell (Robin Williams,The Birdcage,One Hour Photo) from claiming his missing brother's life insurance. Unfortunately, the thugs who dumped the body in the first place (Tim Blake Nelson,O Brother, Where Art Thou?, and W. Earl Brown,Deadwood) want it back, so they kidnap Barnell's wife (Holly Hunter,Raising Arizona), who may or may not have Tourette's Syndrome. Meanwhile, an obsessive insurance agent (Giovanni Ribisi,Saving Private Ryan) smells something fishy and thinks he's found the case that will get him and his phone psychic girlfriend (Alison Lohman,White Oleander) transferred to warmer climes, and Barnell's long-missing brother (Woody Harrelson,White Men Can't Jump) returns, a bit perturbed to learn he's dead.The Big Whitesuffers from an overload of quirkiness--phone psychics, Tourette's, and possibly gay hit men are a lot of whimsy for one movie--but the actors commit themselves to their roles with gusto.

{"description": "Jeannie (Barbara Eden) is even more fetching in color in the second season of one of TV's most charming and endearing fantasies.  Jeannie's navel is still not ready for prime time, and her live-in relationship with astronaut Tony Nelson (Larry Hagman), the man who freed her from that bottle, is still strictly platonic. But, like any wife, she is upset when Tony forgets their one-year anniversary in the season opener. And when Tony unwittingly frees the Blue Djinn, who originally imprisoned Jeannie, it looks like he won't survive year two.  Naturally, being stuck in a bottle for 2,000 years, the vivacious and playful Jeannie is more innocent and naive than her bewitching counterpart,Samantha Stevens. Her well-intentioned magic complicates Tony's life in such episodes as \"My Master, the Rich Tycoon,\" \"My Master, the Rainmaker\" and \"My Master, the Spy.\" She transforms Tony into an operatic virtuoso in \"My Master, the Great Caruso,\" landing him in a talent show, and leading to perhaps the most versatile lip-syncing scene since the Stooges sang the sextet fromLuciainMicro-Phonies. Jeannie blinks Tony back into the Old West in \"Fastest Gun in the East,\" on Captain Kidd's ship in \"My Master, the Pirate,\" and back to Napoleon's court in \"My Master, Napoleon's Buddy.\" No wonder that in \"There Goes the Best Genie I Ever Had,\" he considers taking advantage of Hajii Day and sending her back.Not that there aren't advantages to having a genie around the house. In one episode, she anticipates TiVo by freezing the action on a televised football game while she and Tony go out. In \"The Greatest Invention in the World,\" she fulfills Tony's best friend Roger's (Bill Daily) childhood wish to be the funniest man in the world by turning him into the one and only Groucho Marx. And when Tony is put in charge of providing entertainment for General Peterson's anniversary party, Jeannie summons \"The Greatest Entertainer in the World,\" Sammy Davis Jr. (at his konk-ch-konk best). The season's most captivating story arc begins in the two-parter \"The Girl Who Never Had a Birthday,\" as Tony and Roger resolve to determine Jeannie's birthday (the date is finally revealed in \"Caruso\"). Through it all, poor base psychiatrist Dr. Bellows (Hayden Rorke) is constantly confounded, Mrs. Kravitz-style, by the unexplained supernatural behavior to which he is witness.I Dream of Jeannieis far from PC, but in the realm of TV's guilty pleasures, it is master of its domain.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000KLQUSK", "B000E33VZ4", "B000RXZL0E", "B000TD48SI", "B000ASDFIQ", "B000E3L7FK", "B0009B16TO", "B000HIVIOM", "B000PISZ86", "B0014FAIYS", "B00280QNKG", "B001LRTT30", "B00AIA89OQ", "B0050MB5AC", "B001BN4WHW", "B000B6CODY", "B0006BAWSI", "B0072BNJ0I", "B0007V6IWQ", "B00JPQ1HXO", "B000E3L7EQ", "B001DZOCZU", "0307886948", "B000G0O5J6", "B001LRTT3A", "B000B5XOUM", "B00009VRF0", "B004K63PUW", "B0009OUBPQ", "B000M343AI", "B001LM64VK", "B00HW3L9MG", "B000BITV1A", "B000A0GORS", "B002ACKBU0", "B00DXLO086", "B001NRPQKI", "B00DXLO0D6", "B000G0O5JG", "B000EQ46HI", "B008LC8RQ8", "B000BT96OG", "B000CCBCHQ", "B0009I7NH6", "B000A6T1J0", "B00A2L1CKO", "B000MGBSH6", "B00096S480", "B000CCBCCQ", "B002WIDRLC", "B001992NXI", "B00HQLZCIQ", "B00008EY6N", "B000068V9X", "B000IHYXIK", "B001DHE9FQ", "B001UXJGII", "B003IRUFCU", "B000BOH8YQ", "B000FSME1K", "B000QUEQ6I", "B0007KIFK0", "B00005JLIC", "B000FDFSH2", "B00JAD6BYW", "B0000V4906", "B0002T7YYO", "B00JEZWRE4", "B0006TPE1U", "B0009B16TY", "B000UX6TKM", "B0006Z2L4W", "B000291Q3Y", "B0002ZMHVI", "B001OXLGK0", "B0011NVC9S", "B00IYRLUAU", "B0002JZT5U", "B000CCBCK8", "B00080ZG2E", "B001DHXT4I", "B008L36520", "B000EQ5PTQ", "B000EXDS02", "B0002NY8PI", "B0009UC7MK", "B000YKYT1M", "B0000DFZ5O", "B002LCOHPE", "B0007939QG", "B00005JNS8", "B008L3653O", "B00008EYBH", "B0041SI7B6", "B001E6JC26", "B002WIDRL2", "B001RXDM22", "B000AMJG5I"], "bought_together": ["B000E33VZ4", "B000RXZL0E"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00DXLO0D6", "B000E33VZ4", "B000KLQUSK", "B000RXZL0E"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 70718}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 15.63, "brand": "Columbia Tri Star", "asin": "B000FI8MQG", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51zgk7YZ-6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "I Dream Of Jeannie - The Complete Second Season"}

{"description": "WithDon't Come Knocking, Wim Wenders revisits territory, both literal and metaphorical, first explored inParis, Texas. Not only does he return to the Southwest, but Sam Shepard is back as co-writer. This time, he's also the star. His Howard Spence is a movie cowboy who's had enough. One day while working in Monument Valley, he takes off his boots and hops a train to Nevada to see his mother (Eva Marie Saint, lovely as ever). Little does he know that Sutter (Tim Roth), a by-the-books bondsman, is hot on his trail. Next, Spence travels to Montana where a sad young woman named Sky (Sarah Polley) is recovering from a recent death, while an angry young man named Earl (Gabriel Mann), who sounds much like Chris Isaak, plies the troubadour trade. Spence doesn't know it yet, but they're the results of a rambunctious past that will soon \"come knocking,\" as it were. While in Butte, he also catches up with Doreen (Jessica Lange), a lover from many moons ago. Clearly,Don't Come Knockingis Wenders and Shepard in a reflective mood, even more so than inParis, Texas, as Spence is older and has more regrets than Harry Dean Stanton's Travis. It doesn't leave as much of an impression, but the film is a worthy addition to the post-modern Western canon. Shot by Franz Lustig, it's frames are filled with intense hues--fiery reds, glowing greens--and a plaintive score by T-Bone Burnett.--Kathleen C.

{"description": "Director Mick Garris (Sleepwalkers), also recruited by Stephen King to remakeThe Shining, knows how to capture King's horror aesthetic on film.Desperation, based on a more recent King novel, is a pastiche of earlier King novelties, such as the psycho in uniform, this time Sheriff Collie Entragian (Ron Perlman), and dogs summoned by the devil, this time by TAK, an ancient Chinese demon. Desperation, Nevada has a collapsed mine full of Chinese immigrant ghosts, whose spirits are trapped with TAK until they're accidentally unleashed. The TAK-possessed local sheriff is killing everyone, save a few travelers who stumble through on road trips. In the opening scene, Mary (Annabeth Gish) and her beau are pulled over by Sheriff Entragian, framed by his placing of marijuana in their trunk, then read their rights with a Satanic \"I will kill you\" thrown in. Later, Steve (Steven Weber), Cynthia (Kelly Overton), and Vietnam vet John Marinville (Tom Skerrit), ride into town, and they too encounter the evil policeman's wrath. They all meet a brave, imprisoned boy, David (Shane Haboucha), with whom they team up to end the mayhem.Desperationuses blue and green lighting to embrace the funhouse look, and camera shots highlighting the Sheriff's deranged face make the film occasionally spooky.

{"description": "Forget any off-screen impressions you may have of Mel Gibson, and experience Apocalypto as the mad, bloody runaway train that it is. The story is set in the pre-Columbian Maya population: one village is brutally overrun, its residents either slaughtered or abducted, by a ruling tribe that needs slaves and human sacrifices. We focus on the capable warrior Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood), although Gibson skillfully sketches a whole population of characters--many of whom don't survive the early reels. Most of the film is set in the dense jungle, but the middle section, in a grand Mayan city, is a dazzling triumph of design, costuming, and sheer decadent terror. The movie itself is a triumph of brutality, as Gibson lets loose his well-established fascination with bodily mortification in a litany of assaults including impalement, evisceration, snakebite, and bee stings. It's a dark, disgusted vision, but Gibson doesn't forget to apply some very canny moviemaking instincts to the violence--including the creation of a tremendous pair of villains (strikingly played by Raoul Trujillo and Rodolfo Palacias). The film is in a Maya dialect, subtitled in English, and shot on digital video (which occasionally betrays itself in some blurry quick pans). Amidst all the mayhem, nothing in the film is more devastating than a final wordless exchange of looks between captured villager Blunted (Jonathan Brewer) and his wife's mother (Maria Isabel Diaz), a superb change in tone from their early relationship.

{"description": "William H. Macy, a longtime collaborator of David Mamet, takes on one of Mamet's biggest, ugliest creations in the title role ofEdmond. Edmond drops out of his ordinary life after a chance encounter with a fortune-teller, and cruises through a New York inferno that leads to murder. It also leads to a great deal of the clipped, counter-punching dialogue that Mamet is famous for, although at times the film plays like a monologue interrupted by peripheral blips on Edmond's skewed radar. Mamet's subject is the frenzied reaction of the modern male to the narrowing of his domain, a crisis that drives Edmond to the familiar touchstones of bar, peep show, and whorehouse, none of which provide the solace he thinks they should. The 2005 film is based on Mamet's 1982 play, and somehow the picture might have had more pop if it had been filmed closer to that time, when panicked masculinity was a fresher subject. And the text is a kind of dark, horrific fable that probably worked better in the stylized realm of the stage than on film. Stuart Gordon directs with a blunt forward motion that foregrounds the most unsavory aspects of the material (fans of hisRe-Animatorshould note the presence of Jeffrey Combs as a snotty hotel clerk). Except for Macy, cast members come and go in the episodic flow, some of them (Joe Mantegna and Rebecca Pidgeon) identified with Mamet's work. Julia Stiles plays the unfortunate waitress who falls into Edmond's path, and Bai Ling, Denise Richards, and Mena Suvari are women of the night who want to charge Edmond too much money. But it's Macy's show, and he mercilessly gets inside Edmond's bad self:  a monster of entitlement and self-delusion, given to epiphanies that lead nowhere except his own ego.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0001EFV7C", "079073219X", "B00EMAGKNU", "B001C5LLVE", "B00005Y1UV", "B00JVQ7QTM", "B00002RAO2", "B001CIOCO4", "B000BBOUUE", "B00112S8RS", "B00005UQ9T", "B0000797IO", "B00005K3NU", "B000KX0HFK", "B00G3DA63Y", "B00308BAIU", "B001CITQZY", "B00005BCK9", "B000053VAS", "B0016I0AKU", "B003TRMLM6", "B003BJO8L4", "B006Z7Z3VS", "B00AEBB9AK", "B00005UM2Y", "B00006D2PY", "B0013XZ71K", "B009POCG0Y", "B00005JLX8", "B002E01M8I", "B00009Y3N9", "B003YCL0YG", "B008CYDD7I", "B00177YA6U", "B00ARVRD3E", "B00000IC5K", "B004SIP86Q", "B0000694WH", "0767835093", "B00ET2ODTE", "B000BNX4MW", "B000CQLZ0Q", "B00AADAE8A", "B00BMUL6J6", "B000ALM40I", "B0039UT3LK", "B0000WN1NG", "B00005JM23", "B000096I9Q", "B0025XUTJW", "B003VJTGNE", "B001RJ1Y62", "B000UGBOT0", "B0007R4TIU", "B000QXDFRG", "B000PWQP9I", "B00000F722", "B0015I2S10", "B000FSMEE2", "B003Z8ZC0M", "B00006L91I", "B0000YAEHK", "B00005JH9M", "B000067J0M", "B00005A1TJ", "B0001ZX088", "B002IRYYD2", "6305238065", "B000NVIGLQ", "B009H3LP82", "B00AQ6J5YA", "B0083QN87K", "B0001KNHGI", "B00EVU3T26", "B0002V7SLQ", "B002USF1TU", "B00005QJIG", "B00096S494", "B00009AOBK", "B0001US7WW", "B009OCR2U6", "B0009S2T0M", "B00LEW3L5Y", "B001B1UO7G", "6305263248", "B001DJ7PSC", "B000063JDE", "6305065551", "B000JBXXYK", "B00009K011", "B004HGCNBC", "B000Q8X5A8", "B001AMH7XA", "B002NPY7E0", "B001CSPPU4", "B006LOBZSA", "B00007GZRN", "B00005MEV3", "B00005JKJG"], "bought_together": ["B0001EFV7C"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0001EFV7C", "B00022XE6S", "B00009W5CA", "B000QXDFRG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 157485}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.06, "brand": "Universal Music", "asin": "B000GRUQZQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51WBabMdqsL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Edmond"}

{"description": "The Twilight Zone - Season 1 (The Definitive Edition)Submitted for your approval:The Twilight Zone'sinaugural season, all 36 episodes complete with Rod Serling's original promos for the following week's episode, not seen since their original broadcast. To discuss television's greatest anthology series whose title has become pop culture shorthand for the bizarre and supernatural is to immediately become like Albert Brooks and Dan Aykroyd inTwilight Zone: The Movie; a can-you-top-this recall of famous shocks and favorite twists. Several essential episodes hail from this season, among them, \"Time Enough at Last\" starring Burgess Meredith as a bespectacled bookworm who is the lone survivor of an atomic blast; \"The After-Hours\" starring Anne Francis as a department store shopper haunted by mannequins; and the profoundly disturbing \"The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street,\" in which fear and prejudice turns neighbor against neighbor (and, by the by, whose alien observers inspired Kang and Kodos on The Simpsons).From an unsettlingly persistent hitchhiker to a malevolent slot machine, The Twilight Zone's first season did plumb \"the pit of man's fears.\" One forgets how moving the series could be. Three of this season's most memorable and enduring episodes are the poignant and primal \"stop-the-world-I-want-to-get-off fantasies, \"Walking Distance,\" \"A Stop at Willougby\" and \"The Sixteen-Millimeter Shrine,\" in which desperate characters seek refuge in a simpler past. Serling's few stabs at comedy (\"Mr. Bevis,\" \"The Mighty Casey\") have not aged well, but the series finale, \"A World of His Own,\" starring Keenan Wynn as a playwright whose fictional characters come to life, has a brilliant capper. The episodes are more deliberately paced than one might remember. Less patient younger viewers might be anxious to get to the payoffs, but once they settle into the rhythm, they will savor the literate writing and the performances by such veteran actors as Ed Wynn, Everett Sloan, and Ida Lupino, and newcomers such as Jack Klugman. The extras, including the unaired version of the pilot episode, \"Where is Everybody?\", audio commentaries and recollections, and a Serling college lecture, truly take this six-disc set to another dimension. --Donald LiebensonThe Twilight Zone - Season 2 (The Definitive Edition)The middle ground between light and shadow just became a whole lot sharper and detailed with this stellar five-disc set, which compiles the entire second season of Rod Serling's classic television series, The Twilight Zone, and gilds the whole package by including a treasure trove of supplemental material. TZ's second season (1960-61) is a stand-out in the series' history thanks to its sheer number of memorable stories; among the episodes that have achieved pop culture landmark status are the chilling \"Eye of the Beholder\" (a disfigured woman undergoes surgery to appear more \"normal\") and \"The Silence\" (Franchot Tone wagers that Liam Sullivan cannot silent for a year); \"The Invaders\" (Agnes Moorhead is pitted against tiny space travelers), \"Long Distance Call\" (Lost in Space's Billy Mumy converses with a deceased relative on his toy phone), and the more light-hearted \"Night of the Meek,\" in which department store Santa Claus Art Carney gets a chance to fulfill the real St. Nick's duties. As always, the combination of sharp, intelligent scripting (mostly by Serling, but with notable contributions by Charles Beaumont, Richard Matheson, and George Clayton Johnson) and superb casting (guest stars include Cliff Robertson, Dennis Weaver, Burgess Meredith, William Shatner, John Carradine, and Don Rickles) produces television that remains as thought-provoking and entertaining today as it was over 40 years ago.Though The Twilight Zone has received numerous home video releases over the years, the aptly titled Definitive Edition is arguably the finest presentation of this series to date. Each of the episodes have been digitally remastered from original camera negatives (even the episodes filmed on videotape look good) and magnetic soundtracks; Serling's previews for upcoming episodes and advertising \"billboards\" (sponsor spots) have also been included, as have commentaries by Rickles, Weaver, Robertson, Shelly Berman, and other performers. Clips of Serling on The Jack Benny Show and in conversation with Mike Wallace, audio interviews with cast and crew members by Twilight Zone Companion author Marc Scott Zicree, radio adaptations of classic episodes, and even the script for \"Twenty-Two,\" complete with Serling's notes, round out the set, which belongs in the collection of anyone who's ever been enthralled by this landmark series. Now, if only the same treatment could be afforded to Serling's other anthology program, Night Gallery&hellip; --Paul GaitaThe Twilight Zone - Season 4 (The Definitive Edition)Despite major changes in personnel and the ill-advised switch to a full-hour format, Twilight Zone (with \"The\" removed from its title) began its fourth season on a promising note. Written by series veteran Charles Beaumont, the premiere episode \"In His Image\" maintained the high standards that Rod Serling had established throughout the first three seasons, and the story--about a man (George Grizzard) who builds an exact robot replica of himself, with dire consequences--fit well into the hour-long format that Serling reluctantly went along with. Twilight Zone struggled with its expanded length, resulting in some episodes that lack the consistent punch of earlier half-hour episodes. Exhausted by three seasons of prodigious creativity, Serling and Buck Houghton vacated their roles as producers (with Serling's involvement limited to script feedback, writing nearly half of the season's episodes, and on-screen hosting), and TV veteran Herbert Hirschman became the new show-runner (departing mid-season, he was replaced by Bert Granet), promising not to tinker with the series' proven success. But Twilight Zone was inevitably becoming a shadow of its former self, and the involvement of proven TZ writers like Richard Matheson, Earl Hamner, Jr., and Beaumont could not entirely compensate for Serling's growing detachment.Still, these 18 episodes include some fine examples of enduring quality, such as Matheson's \"Death Ship,\" starring Jack Klugman and Ross Martin in a recurring nightmare scenario, and featuring the same spaceship model used in the 1956 sci-fi classic Forbidden Planet. Beaumont's \"Miniature,\" starring Robert Duvall, was the only hour-long episode pulled from initial syndication (due to a plagiarism lawsuit that was ultimately dismissed), so its inclusion here (along with color scenes from its eventual syndication) is a welcome treat. Serling lampoons the medium of television with \"The Bard\" (with an early appearance by Burt Reynolds), and his teleplay for \"On Thursday We Leave for Home\" is the season's highlight, ranking among Twilight Zone's finest science-fiction episodes. It remained clear, however, that Twilight Zone was past its prime, and when the series was renewed for a fifth season in the spring of 1963, a return to its original half-hour format was a belated step in the right direction.Of course, season 4's overall strengths and weaknesses won't matter to collectors of The Definitive Edition DVD sets, and a wealth of archival bonus features make this a must-have addition to anyone's TZ collection. Image Entertainment and features producer Paul Browstein deserve extra credit for their diligent assembly of supplements that render all previous TZ releases virtually obsolete. Nothing has been overlooked, from the commentary (on \"Death Ship\") and interview clips by acclaimed TZ expert Mark Scott Zicree to the inclusion of a vintage TZ spoof from Saturday Night Live, radio-show adaptations starring Blair Underwood, Jason Alexander, Lou Diamond Phillips and others, and a vintage Twilight Zone comic book, accessible on computers with Adobe reader installed. There's even a brief Rod Serling blooper taken from a scratchy 16-millimeter print, proving that no stone was left unturned in making this a truly definitive TZ collection. --Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["1879505096", "B003VJTGNE", "B00005JOJE", "B0002CX1M0", "B001DXS4DI", "B006TBYC76", "B0016MOWNM", "B00092ZLDK", "B0002J4ZX2", "B000HDR814", "B0007CEXUY", "B00068NVLQ", "B003NOGNQU", "B000TXPXD2", "B000AL733G", "B002NPY7GS", "B00DXLO086", "B00JKTFQJM", "B00FEOYY8G", "B005UL4NF2", "B0007WFY4S", "B001IXXYCE", "1550227440", "B001DHXT6G", "B0030E5PYO", "B00CPR3RB0", "B000TGJ8B2", "B0000BV1XX", "1490423915", "B00GSMZ3I8", "B000E6ESEY", "B002FLOTPO", "B002PQ7JR4", "B001HUHBBS", "B00C7A8WWO", "B000V3JGIS", "B000RXVNCO", "B001DSNEME", "B00005KHJP", "B008HSK3PE", "B00JK47BHM", "B002PQ7JQK", "B00EQ2KXL4", "B001LQQJ66", "B000ATQYWY", "B000RO9PTQ", "B000LC4ZIA", "0806536152", "B000NA21YA", "B00000JQB7", "B000EHQTZO", "B000SQFC2M", "B00K6DEQ92", "B008RJ6TTC", "B00DXLO0D6", "B0009JE6FC", "B00BMJ7ZKG", "B005X4P3DC", "B007Y1NNAW", "B000HWZ4GQ", "B008X8VM1W", "B000HEZEYG", "B00026L7OU", "B00BDZV4OW", "B00IF0KAYS", "B006BZ8NSE", "B0024FADBA", "B001CQONHM", "B0011FLGZQ", "B003NKU9XM", "B00CRVL5ZE", "B00EIJTLK4", "B008X8U83K", "B001JFKWE4", "B00096S47G", "B007PZ6SYK", "B00BM2JVAA", "B00EEEHLKU", "B001CQONOA", "B00BTYPW7C", "B000BF0C8E", "B0006UEVTA", "B00DYQ1G78", "B001DHXT4I", "B000XJD3K2", "B002C6A6N6", "B0002XVQNK", "B00027JYNK", "B001DHXT48", "B009GGWW3W", "B001A7GOCA", "B000C20VNM", "B0000648YD", "B000N2HD6O", "B008N8A3JE", "B005OASMLU", "B000BGR1B4", "B000LXGXY8", "B001CDFY5U", "B0055UA1KO"], "bought_together": ["1879505096"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00EEEHLKU", "B000E6ESEY", "B0007WFY4S", "B00BI3XZA0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 6096}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 145.95, "brand": "Paramount", "asin": "B000H5U5EE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61wObjWq3mL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Twilight Zone: The Complete Definitive Collection"}

{"description": "Any fan of Johnny Carson will certainly have their own idea of what constitutes his best stuff. With over 30 years of material from the king of late-night TV to cull through, any collection is bound to be missing something. Whether or not your favorite moments are to be found in the almost four hours of Carson classics in this first volume ofThe Best of Carsonis open to question, but either way there&#x92;s plenty here to remind you of what made Johnny so popular. Each disc features highlights of guest visits, comic skits, and unexpected moments (most of the selections in this volume are from the 1980s). Disc one features highlights with guests like Steve Martin and \"Super Dave\" Osborne, as well as Carson characters like \"Aunt Blabby\" and \"Carnac the Magnificent,\" along with other memorable moments. The most intriguing piece by far is the famous \"Return to Studio One\" episode from 1969, where Bob Hope and Dean Martin stole the show with their unannounced appearances (the episode was apparently lost for years and accidentally found in a vault at the Armed Forces Television Network). Disc two features appearances by animal handler Jim Fowler, the Peking Acrobats, and Garry Shandling in addition to \"Tonight ShowMemories,\" a 30-minute retrospective of the show&#x92;s history. Disc three features Ellen DeGeneres, Rodney Dangerfield, Don Rickles, and more comic skits, including one that imagines whatThe Tonight Showwould be like if NBC were to be bought by the Japanese. The bonus feature on disc three is a photo gallery featuring shots of early guests. What is missing here is one of the most important aspects of Carson&#x92;s legacy: the launching of many future stars&#x92; careers on his show. There&#x92;s no late-night debut here of Jay Leno, David Letterman, or Jerry Seinfeld for example. But despite that, there&#x92;s still enough material here to give fans plenty of classic Carson entertainment.--Daniel Vancini", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000068WS7", "B001DW2BJ2", "B000NJL4SK", "B004E2DPTI", "B0009X49BE", "B00D2UMHQU", "B007T40GMW", "B00D2UMI9Q", "B00BI440I0", "B00DJW1S34", "B00FZWY9UK", "B0000542D2", "B0085Z6ZD8", "B003V0FW9K", "B007JVM69Q", "B000LMPMQ4", "B00452J596", "B000NJL4SA", "6303066747", "B000HXDQME"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000068WS7", "B007T40GMW", "B001DW2BJ2", "B0085Z6Z2O"]}, "price": 24.01, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 110301}, "asin": "B000HXDQN8", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51YKHj-nqKL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Best of Carson, Volume 1"}
{"description": "Lo and behold,Clerks IIdefies the odds as a sequel that even the most ardentClerksfans can be happy about. Twelve years after Kevin Smith turned the independent film world upside-down with his $27,000 black-and-white comedy, perpetual slackers Dante (Brian O'Halloran) and Randal (Jeff Anderson) return for another raucous romp in suburbia, but this time there's no beloved Quick Stop mini-mart to ensure their low-level employment. Now they're aimless 33-year-olds flippin' burgers at Mooby's, a fast-food joint with a cow theme that's \"udderly delicious.\" Dante's engaged to his long-time girlfriend but has unexpectedly fallen in love with Mooby's manager Becky (and since she's played by Rosario Dawson, can you blame him?), and Randal's still holding out for life, liberty, and the pursuit of low ambition. The responsibilities of adulthood are rearing their ugly head, and with Jay and Silent Bob (Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith) still dealing weed and generally being obnoxious, well... something's gotta give, right? The way Smith has written this long-awaited follow-up, the dilemmas of Dante, Randal, and their ongoing friendship are something that anyone can relate to, and with Dawson lighting up the screen (in a role demanded by producer Harvey Weinstein to boost box-office appeal), the movie's romantic chemistry is surprisingly delightful. Rest assured, also, that Smith (shooting mostly in color this time, on a $5 million budget) hasn't forgotten where he came from:Clerks IIis jam-packed with the same lewd, crude humor that madeClerksan indie-film phenomenon, and Smith's good-natured sincerity is still on full display, ensuring that only the most prudish viewers could possibly be offended. For everyone else, this is as enjoyable as any sequel could ever hope to be, with amusing cameos by Smith-movie veterans Ben Affleck and Jason Lee, among others.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004SIP6LS", "B00000IQW4", "B004SIP8ES", "B004XVMCH6", "B007D0FUTG", "B00003CWOL", "B004U7MQW4", "B001KKU9DW", "B005FUTBWS", "B0016MJ6GA", "B00007149S", "B000CPH9PM", "B004SIP6N6", "B001CDFY4Q", "B000I0QLOQ", "B000ICL3L0", "B000EMGJAO", "1592406890", "B001OD4S50", "B000JJ4DNW", "B00068WOH8", "B0018BZEOC", "B005G5NPLA", "B0023TCWE8", "B00363WGBO", "B0002V7TMY", "B007D0FVYA", "B00003CXPS", "B000A7DVR2", "B001J9KJ4I", "0783230338", "B000BBOUCC", "B00009MGEM", "B000093FLA", "B005J9ZFQG", "B000031EFY", "B001C0JCBA", "B006WXHJLC", "B00029LO5E", "B001MFNB58", "0783227434", "B002ZG96ZC", "0800141687", "B008220BGQ", "B00007AJGM", "B0050PYNP8", "B00441GYVA", "B000M9CB4W", "1592407447", "B00BEIYH1A", "B00AEFXVW0", "B000WC3864", "B00AEFZ7F4", "B003VPX5Y4", "0767837398", "B005LAII12", "B000BYA5G4", "B009AMALGM", "B000AARKXA", "B00003CXS7", "B000GBEWGQ", "B000AXWHSA", "B004QL7K70", "0783229526", "B00005JN2Z", "B002O3Z4VG", "B00B4VSUBK", "B000WZEZGI", "B000VXWX7E", "B002ZG97XI", "B00BPEJWAE", "B008RNYMG0", "184856497X", "B00860YIJU", "B004SIP8ZM", "B004EPZ084", "B004SIP9Z6", "B00008975Z", "B00005JM23", "B000IZJZIU", "B003Y5H5C4", "B006TTC50Y", "B004SEUJFK", "B00E1HIX66", "B00005JKMN", "B00005JKHP", "B000069CF0", "B00007ELER", "B009DA743Y", "B001G5T6GW", "B00004TJMW", "B0006HBZE2", "B00005JNZU", "B00029RTAI", "B004UXUWEC", "B0018RKEQE", "6305551235", "B007WW94TW"], "bought_together": ["B004SIP6LS", "B00000IQW4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004SIP6LS", "B00000IQW4", "B0016MJ6GA", "B004SIP8ES"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 14519}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.25, "brand": "Weinstein Company", "asin": "B000I0RNVQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51tIUlFx1EL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Clerks II (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "Only one film under his belt, and already Flynn Carsen (Noah Wylie) is  talking like Indiana Jones. \"Relax,\" he tells a companion before daringly retrieving an ancient artifact before it can be used for evil. \"This kind of stuff happens to me all the time.\" A character of modest charms (much like this made-for-cable movie), Carsen is not your typical movie action hero. His brain serves him better than his brawn. Early on, his knowledge of vegetation plays a key role in a cliff-jumping escape from pursuing bad guys. Carsen, for those just tuning in, is a librarian at the Metropolitan Library, which secretly houses history's mythic artifacts, including the sword Excalibur, and the Shroud of Turin. The fate of the world is once again in Carsen's hands when a map to the legendary King Solomon's Mines is stolen. Carsen embarks on another fantastic global adventure, with stops in Casablanca (with inevitable references to the Humphrey Bogart classic) and Kenya. This time, he has new female companionship, Emily (Gabrielle Anwar), a beautiful archaeologist who can match the much-educated Carsen degree for degree. Reprising their roles from the first film are Olympia Dukakis as Flynn's meddling mother, who tries to fix him up with his third cousin (\"You'll have plenty to talk about\"), Jane Curtin as flinty library administrator, Charlene (\"Save your receipts\"), and Bob Newhart as his mentor, Judson. Savvy viewers will see plot twists and character revelations coming from a mile away, but that is all part of the fun, as are the hokey special effects and knowing humor (\"There's always a secret passage,\" Carsen observes while navigating a catacomb). Who know if there will ever be anotherIndiana Jonesmovie. Until then,The Librarianis worth checking out, especially on DVD, where it can be enjoyed without intrusive commercial interruption.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0009NSCRQ", "B001MVYUQG", "B001RXDM1I", "B0002J58GU", "B003KW7CQ0", "B003QJC208", "B003MX91H0", "B004I1K2FK", "B001L2ZSFS", "B0013BM63O", "B0000YEEPS", "B00K2CHW48", "B00GTZWZH6", "B00K2CHWYI", "B006QU70OM", "B00GSTHC7G", "B00GOHZLDO", "B00KHA9BQ2", "B00F3L8P26", "B00005JN5E", "B003XEKUBY", "B00B999F2U", "B00IYRLUAU", "B008JFURII", "B004LROMS4", "B008L0YMVE", "B00JPFTX5O", "B0007OCG5Q", "B00L4K450G", "B001GF8WP8", "B00K2CHX9C", "B0009PBLU4", "B0006IIPIK", "B00B9UEOPC", "B00J11U54K", "B00K7IPFSM", "B006VJ1AAI", "B004UXVDOA", "B000M53GMW", "B000FO0A9W", "B007R6DJP8", "B00003CY6P", "B0090SI56Y", "B00E8OMZGG", "B008JFUNTG", "B005LAIH2W", "B00FR23QNE", "B0010X741Y", "B000MX7V70", "B003L77FYS", "B00LG6XHDY", "B002BWP2IK", "6305428514", "B000NDEXPM", "B00GTZWXYQ", "B00HVFA322", "B007K3JFUQ", "B00HJAB094", "B0051GOB2G", "0785190295", "B00EIXWMII", "B00FE5MX74", "B00GOHZV6Q", "B002ZG99KO", "B00AEBB8QK", "B00005JM5B", "B0053O89KG", "B003L77GWE", "1401324819", "B00BD6KXKW", "B00GTZWUPS", "B00KS9V6EC", "B00F84H73Q", "B0016Q2D5M", "B000Y11BC6", "B00DW5IJR6", "B0006GAOCW", "B00DI013EG", "B002U0KHME", "B003R4ZMPE", "B005G4TJUC", "B00018D3YG", "1484711424", "B00E5I2M6I", "B003F3NDWG", "B00IWTVDUW", "B00KHB3H5W", "B00K0D9760", "B00005JO5L", "B005PPMHO2", "B0056GLNQI", "B00AIBZMM2", "0792839137", "B009AMAKWM", "B00023BLXK", "B000ASATYY", "B003RHZ6CK", "B0049GYXH2", "B000BW7QWW", "B00E5I2M9K"], "bought_together": ["B0009NSCRQ", "B001MVYUQG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0009NSCRQ", "B001MVYUQG", "B001RXDM1I", "B005GELLQC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 5847}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 10.19, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B000IJ7A24", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51MPVHjLa9L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Librarian  - Return to King Solomon's Mines"}
{"description": "This clever, funny big-screen adaptation of Lauren Weisberger's best-seller takes some of the snarky bite out of the chick lit book, but smoothes out the characters' boxy edges to make a more satisfying movie. There's no doubtThe Devil Wears Prada belongs to Meryl Streep, who turns in an Oscar&#65533;-worthy (seriously!) strut as the monster editor-in-chief ofRunway, an elite fashion magazine full of size-0, impossibly well-dressed plebes. This makes new second-assistant Andrea (Anne Hathaway), who's smart but an unacceptable size 6, stick out like a sore thumb. Streep has a ball sending her new slave on any whimsical errand, whether it's finding the seventh (unpublished) Harry Potter book or knowing what type she means when she wants \"skirts.\" Though Andrea thumbs her nose at the shallow world of fashion (she's only doing the job to open doors to a position atThe New Yorker someday), she finds herself dually disgusted yet seduced by the perks of the fast life. The film sends a basic message: Make work your priority, and you'll be rich and powerful... and lonely. Any other actress would have turned Miranda into a scenery-chewing Cruella, but Streep's underplayed, brilliant comic timing make her a fascinating, unapologetic character. Adding frills to the movie's fun are Stanley Tucci as Streep's second-in-command, Emily Blunt (My Summer of Love) as the overworked first assistant, Simon Baker as a sexy writer, and breathtaking couture designs any reader ofVogue would salivate over. --Ellen A.

{"description": "If Richard Donner's 1978 feature filmSuperman: The Moviemade us believe a man could fly, Bryan Singer's 2006 follow-up,Superman Returns, lets us remember that a superhero movie can make our spirits soar. Superman (played by newcomer Brandon Routh) comes back to Earth after a futile five-year search for his destroyed home planet of Krypton. As alter ego Clark Kent, he's eager to return to his job at the Daily Planet and to see Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth). Lois, however, has moved on: she now has a fianc&#xE9; (James Marsden), a son (Tristan Leabu), and a Pulitzer Prize for her article entitled \"Why the World Doesn't Need Superman.\" On top of this emotional curveball, his old archrival Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) is plotting the biggest land grab in history.Singer, who made a strong impression among comic-book fans for his work on the X-Men franchise and directed Spacey inThe Usual Suspects, brings both a fresh eye and a sense of respect to the world's oldest superhero. He borrows John Williams's great theme music and Marlon Brando's voice as Jor-El, and the story (penned by Singer'sX-Mencollaborators Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris) is a sort-of-sequel to the first two films in the franchise (choosing to ignore that the third and fourth movies ever happened). The humorous and romantic elements give the movie a heart, Singer's art-deco Metropolis is often breathtaking, and the special effects are elegant and spectacular, particularly an early airplane-disaster set-piece. Of the cast, Routh is excellent as the dual Superman/Clark, Spacey is both droll and vicious as Luthor, and Parker Posey gets the best lines as Luthor's moll Kitty. But at 23, Bosworth seems too young for the five-years-past-grizzled Lois. It's nice to see Noel Neill, Jack Larson (both from the classicAdventures of SupermanTV series), and Eva Marie-Saint on the screen as well. Superman Returns is one of those projects that was in development for seemingly forever, but it was worth the wait -- it's the most enjoyable superhero movie sinceSpider-Man 2andThe Incredibles.--David HoriuchiMore SupermanWatch our exclusive interviews with the cast ofSuperman ReturnsOther feature filmsSuperman in high definitionSmallvilleAdventures of SupermanSee all Superman DVDs", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001DJLD2G", "B000IJ79VQ", "B000IJ79X4", "B000IJ79XE", "B000IJ79WU", "B008JFUPFI", "B000IJ79UW", "B001CDR1FG", "B000ION23U", "B002GSXKN8", "B004EPZ07K", "B0000959N0", "B00005JNTU", "B004LWZWFQ", "B001DHXT20", "B000VI70QS", "B0006L0LOS", "B0007P0Y7C", "B000UR9T8C", "B00005JNJV", "B00005JMQW", "B00005JKCH", "B000AYELVU", "B004LWZW42", "B0090SI56Y", "B001OST0LW", "B001OST0M6", "B001QB9H1U", "B000HCO83Q", "B000PE0G0A", "B001GCUO1Q", "B0002IQMAM", "B004LWZWGA", "B008JFUS0U", "B000P0J06K", "B000OVLBF8", "B00E5I2MCM", "B003YAR97K", "B001GZ6QC4", "B00080ZG2O", "B003QO8TOQ", "B001FB55HQ", "B005LAIGW8", "B000I8OM94", "B000FO0AHY", "B00IZZDWKM", "B000P0J06U", "B0007V6ITE", "B008JFUO72", "B000AYELVA", "B002NXSRVG", "B00DYEN6XC", "B00E5I2MEK", "B000BT96EG", "B001HQZJMU", "B001QTXM5Y", "B00E5I2M6I", "B002HWRYJE", "B00E5I2M9K", "B001614E68", "B000059Z8L", "B001VLBDD0", "B000EU1Q3Q", "B000EU1Q2M", "B000KJU1KK", "B00BTYMPUY", "B000H30B2C", "B001F7MSFM", "B0013BM63O", "B00F4FFO8E", "B000EGDB10", "B00008G8M5", "B00JPS7HOA", "0790738953", "B000B7QCGS", "B000HWZ4E8", "B00BBXSPES", "B000FMGTTE", "B0083SBMBM", "B003Z8ZCDO", "B005LAII44", "B000P6XQ50", "B000VI28Z6", "B00AZMFJYA", "B001RHGRT8", "B000F4RH8E", "B002ZG99B8", "B001AK3S4Y", "B00005JL78", "B0002ZMHX6", "B0007G89FU", "B006VRRGNK", "B00BBAQD6S", "B009JBWOU0", "B000BT96FA", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B00BGI086Q", "B003UN2ICM", "B0000VCZMK"], "bought_together": ["B008JFUPFI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B008JFUPFI", "B00F4FFO8E", "B001DJLD2G", "B000IJ79UW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 57565}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.73, "brand": "DC Comics", "asin": "B000J10EQU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Ddmxk8VML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Superman Returns (Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "Out patrolling a California highway, police officer Edward Malus (Nicolas Cage) stops a station wagon to return a little girl's lost doll. Moments later, a runaway truck slams into the station wagon, igniting it into a fiery wreck with the mother and child trapped inside. Edward fails to save them before the car explodes...and then spends months of his life choking down pills to get the image of their faces out of his head. But Edward is about to get a second chance. A desperate letter from his former girlfriend, Willow (Kate Beahan), arrives at his home with no postmark. Willow came into his life and left just as unexpectedly years before. But now, her daughter Rowan has gone missing, and Edward is theonly person she trusts to help locate her. She asks him to come to her home on a private island - Summersisle - a place with its own traditions where people observe a forgotten way of life. Edward seizes the opportunity to make his life right again, and soon finds himself on a seaplane bound for the islands of the Pacific Northwest. But nothing is what it seems on isolated Summersisle, where a culture, dominated by its matriarch Sister Summersisle (Ellen Burstyn), is bound together by arcane traditions and a pagan festival called \"the Day of Death and Rebirth.\" The secretive people of Summersisle only ridicule his investigation, insisting that a child named Rowan never existed there... or if she ever did was no longer alive. But what Edward doesn't know is that Willow's plea for help has invited more into his life than a chance for redemption. In unraveling Summersisle's closely held secrets, Edward is drawn into a web of ancient traditions and murderous deceit, and each step he takes closer to the lost child brings him one step closer to the unspeakable. And one step closer to the Wicker Man.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001J710Y8", "B000PMFRZQ", "B002TVQ48K", "B000GRUMRS", "B0073U2ETK", "B001J710Z2", "B004EPYZOO", "B00012QLB4", "B000TGJ8CQ", "B001KRVLCI", "B000CSUNQQ", "B001GCUO02", "B00AEBB8JM", "B000CFYAMC", "6304806434", "B004XFZ4JK", "B000OVLBF8", "B000BBOUW2", "B000BYA5G4", "B000059TG6", "B004EI2NMM", "B00BFNJHCI", "B00004Z4WR", "B001KKU9CI", "0792838068", "6304711891", "B003ZD9DSO", "B00BJB2GZG", "B00003CXIV", "6305760403", "B00BTYMPX6", "B000U7169M", "B00IKM5LXG", "B001DZOC6Y", "B007IUEEA2", "B00062IDGK", "B00003CXXG", "B003YF9PX6", "B00092ZLSK", "B00005JLRE", "B000TJ6PBK", "B00441GZ00", "B005F2JRUC", "0792844831", "B000FI8MPW", "B0000AGWMF", "B00005JN5E", "0767810856", "B000YNFXZA", "B000OVLBGM", "B00006LPGP", "B00020HAX8", "B0010YVCB6", "B0009X763M", "B00005JP3R", "B000RZGHSM", "B000EHRVP6", "B00008L3UF", "B000286S1U", "B00DNJ95S8", "B009L79YFU", "B00KCTG4PO", "B005DR64OQ", "B0019X3YX2", "B000RZGHSW", "B00406UK7S", "B000JLTRIQ", "B003UMW63O", "B0047T74CM", "B000ALM40I", "B008XAT0TQ", "B002GHHHKG", "B009XTF8KQ", "B001OST0M6", "B009IV2Z3M", "B002ZG99KO", "B00E8G5HNM", "B0002DB5PO", "B00HOGBXS6", "B008DVJOQ4", "B004SIP92O", "B00AEBBA2W", "B00I9H3VTS", "B0011NVC98", "B001JNNDJM", "B000W1SZA4", "B00FEHCQEC", "B00AEFYYH6", "B005LAIGW8", "B00005JNNT", "B004CQZFH6", "B000U1ZV62", "B000RGN2JI", "B003L20IEW", "B00006FDBT", "B00004Y87O", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00803PFZO", "B00GOYC3I8"], "bought_together": ["B001J710Y8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001J710Y8", "B00004Z4WR", "B002TVQ48K", "B000PMFRZQ"]}, "price": 9.33, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 75218}, "asin": "B000JYW5DM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51TT3AM10VL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Wicker Man (Full Screen Unrated/Rated Edition)"}

{"description": "If you're still eating that fast-food burger after watchingSuper Size Me, you might not feel too hungry after watchingFast Food Nation, a fictionalized feature based on Eric Schlosser's bestselling nonfiction expose. Director Richard Linklater, who cowrote the screenplay with Schlosser, guides a topnotch ensemble cast through a peek behind the veil of how that Big Mac is born. Much of the film focuses on the illegal immigrants who work in the loosely regulated meat-packing industry, and actors including the luminous Catalina Sandino Moreno (Maria Full of Grace), who plays a desperate but outraged laborer. Greg Kinnear also delivers a spot-on performance as a fast-food chain marketing manager, trying frantically to discover the source of stomach-turning contamination in the company's meat. Stories are woven in unexpected ways, and cameos by the likes of Kris Kristofferson, Patricia Arquette, and especially Bruce Willis keep the narrative fresh. The film has a point of view, but thanks to Linklater's deft touch, is never didactic. As Willis's character slyly says, \"Most people don't like to be told what's best for them.\" Agreed, yetFast Food Nationlikely will help the viewer be more conscious of what's on the end of that fork. --A.T.
