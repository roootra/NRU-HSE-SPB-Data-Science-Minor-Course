{"description": "Confidently conceived and brilliantly executed,Gattacahad a somewhat low profile release in 1997, but audiences and critics hailed the film's originality. It's since been recognized as one of the most intelligent science fiction films of the 1990s. Writer-director Andrew Niccol, the talented New Zealander who also wrote the acclaimed Jim Carrey vehicleThe Truman Show, depicts a near-future society in which one's personal and professional destiny is determined by one's genes. In this society, \"Valids\" (genetically engineered) qualify for positions at prestigious corporations, such as Gattaca, which grooms its most qualified employees for space exploration. \"In-Valids\" (naturally born), such as the film's protagonist, Vincent (Ethan Hawke), are deemed genetically flawed and subsequently fated to low-level occupations in a genetically caste society. With the help of a disabled \"Valid\" (Jude Law), Vincent subverts his society's social and biological barriers to pursue his dream of space travel; any random mistake--and an ongoing murder investigation at Gattaca--could reveal his plot. Part thriller, part futuristic drama and cautionary tale,Gattacaestablishes its social structure so convincingly that the entire scenario is chillingly believable. With Uma Thurman as the woman who loves Vincent and identifies with his struggle,Gattacais both stylish and smart, while Jude Law's performance lends the film a note of tragic and heartfelt humanity.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEFYCW8", "B0001CNRAM", "B0069UP2PI", "B002GIBVVG", "B0018O4YT0", "B00005JL78", "B0001WTULW", "B00005JLWN", "B00003CXXP", "B0031SZER2", "B000VWX6TO", "0137135599", "1430218436", "0262514044", "B0001NBNDY", "B004EQAVHI", "B000006FQS", "B00A44GNTE", "B0006IIPIK", "B002ZG97J2", "B000056PMU", "B000Y7U98C", "B000JMK6LW", "B003XURDAY", "B002UZCJ8Y", "B000N6TX1I", "0470944889", "B00005JPAR", "B009YQJ322", "B0013LL2Z2", "B002QW7ALM", "B000XBPDYY", "B0007PALZ2", "B00005QAQH", "6305428506", "B000FS9FCG", "B004WCTLNY", "B004L9GMBC", "B002GHHHKQ", "0800195175", "0783233523", "B0087ZG7HK", "B00008438U", "B000MZGN40", "B000LC55F2", "1449319262", "B0017VG618", "B00005RDAN", "0783225733", "B00009ATIX", "0767821629", "B001MYIXAC", "0143037889", "B0016I0AJG", "B004LWZW7E", "B00GKOJ98E", "B0007DFJ0G", "B002ZG97CO", "B0043X1FL8", "630587493X", "B005LAIIHG", "B00000G02H", "B000KX0IOA", "B002ZG980U", "B00AEBB8SS", "B00AEFXPSK", "B00363WGHI", "B003ASLJQI", "B000ICL3KG", "B0001O3YV2", "B008JFUN50", "B00AEFXESQ", "B000000WF9", "B00B0U2SFE", "B00AEFY5B6", "B0002OXVBO", "B0041KKYEM", "B00AEFXCLU", "B000A7DVR2", "B000K7VHLY", "B00005JLSB", "B00005JMJG", "B00005B6JZ", "B002ZG98SW", "B000F5GNX8", "B00011D1OK", "B001HN69C2", "B0002CHIKG", "B00005JN0T", "B000AM6OQ2", "B0006A9FKA", "B004SIP6C2", "B0010YSD7M", "B0013D8LHM", "B00011CZRE", "B00008RH3J", "B002PLMJ74", "B004SIP6WW", "B00147F8WS"], "bought_together": ["B00AEFYCW8", "B0069UP2PI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000BO0LH2", "B0018O4YT0", "B000000WF9", "1424821029"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 10112}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 10.19, "brand": "", "asin": "0767805712", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51QM82SNT3L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Gattaca"}
{"description": "Anybody who has written him off because of his string of stinkers--or anybody who's too young to rememberThe Goodbye Girl--may be shocked at the accomplishment and nuance of Richard Dreyfuss's performance inClose Encounters of the Third Kind. Here, he plays a man possessed; contacted by aliens, he (along with other members of the \"chosen\") is drawn toward the site of the incipient landing: Devil's Tower, in rural Wyoming. As in many Spielberg films, there are no personalized enemies; the struggle is between those who have been called and a scientific establishment that seeks to protect them by keeping them away from the arriving spacecraft. The ship, and the special effects in general, are every bit as jaw-dropping on the small screen as they were in the theater (well, almost). Released in 1977 as a cerebral alternative to the swashbuckling science fiction epics then in vogue,Close Encountersnow seems almost wholesome in its representation of alien contact and interested less in philosophizing about extraterrestrials than it is in examining the nature of the inner \"call.\" Ultimately a motion picture about the obsession of the driven artist or determined visionary,Close Encounterscomes complete with the stock Spielberg wives and girlfriends who seek to tether the dreamy, possessed protagonists to the more mundane concerns of the everyday. So a spectacular, seminal motion picture indeed, but one with gender politics that are all too terrestrial.--Miles Bethany", "related": {"also_bought": ["6304143184", "0783231482", "6300182355", "6303506291", "6303212263", "B00005B238", "6300214060", "0790736233", "0783216084", "6303148352", "B00006AL1C", "6300268993", "6304508611", "0767825411", "6300183971", "6304509154", "6301300556", "6301670124", "6305363668", "B0000A36J1", "B000059HFB", "6300181286", "6300247236", "B00004RV8M", "B0000048TX", "B00000JQSV", "B00000JXVM", "B00000JGEK"], "bought_together": ["6304143184"], "also_viewed": ["B0087F7VSY", "6304143184", "6301792734", "B00000ILE6", "0783226152", "6301966732", "B00BBND56G"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 557907}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.95, "brand": "", "asin": "076780192X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/511NY005RKL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Close Encounters of the Third Kind (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]"}

{"description": "For all of its conventional plotting about an obsessive-compulsive curmudgeon (Jack Nicholson) who improves his personality at the urging of his gay neighbor (Greg Kinnear) and a waitress (Helen Hunt) who inspires his best behavior, this is one of the sharpest Hollywood comedies of the 1990s. Nicholson could play his role in his sleep (the Oscar he won should have gone to Robert Duvall forThe Apostle), but his mischievous persona is precisely necessary to give heart to his seemingly heartless character, who is of all things a successful romance novelist. As a single mom with a chronically asthmatic young son, Hunt gives the film its conscience and integrity (along with plenty of wry humor), and she also won an Oscar for her wonderful performance. Greg Kinnear had to settle for an Oscar nomination (while cowriter-director James L. Brooks was inexplicably snubbed by Oscar that year), but his work was also singled out in the film's near-unanimous chorus of critical praise. It's questionable whether a romance between Hunt and the much older Nicholson is entirely believable, but this movie's smart enough--and charmingly funny enough--to make it seem endearingly possible.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0001AVZA8", "B000YAF4MA", "0800141741", "B004FQX5B6", "B0000YEEGM", "B0038N9WKU", "B000FVQLQQ", "B00AEBB9WI", "B00005JLSK", "0783226845", "B0000AOV4I", "B000YDBPAM", "B000XJD33O", "B004SIP7ZS", "B00081U7HC", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00AEBB8YW", "B00003CXFV", "B001ECDVK4", "6305212112", "B000EHRVOW", "B00009Y3PV", "6304765266", "B00004RJ73", "B005F2JRUC", "0783225733", "B00AEFXYOA", "6305236569", "B000OCZA04", "B000FFJYBG", "B003ASLJK4", "0792833198", "B000JYW5B4", "B00012QLB4", "B00BTYRB3U", "B0043X1FL8", "B000055Y0Y", "B00005B6JZ", "B000EHQU0S", "B00AEBB9UK", "B00008G7UF", "B0002B15ZG", "B00005JG6N", "B001MBTTNA", "B001ECDVJU", "B00003CWQR", "B00AEFY4CG", "630471193X", "B002GHHHP6", "B00AEBB9NM", "B0000A02TZ", "0767821769", "B00569I5BQ", "B00AEFYSWM", "B00AEFXYJA", "B000XT1P3E", "B002GHHHGU", "B00026ZG10", "6305128952", "B00005OLYF", "B001LMAK9W", "B000N6U0E2", "B000EMGJ7C", "B000023VTP", "B00CPTUOI2", "B004SIP9U6", "B00001ZWUS", "B003BV8ICC", "B0043X1FM2", "B0013XZ2QK", "B00AEFXT1S", "B00AEBB9FA", "B007SPPANM", "B00005JM4Q", "B007N31YH0", "B000VECAD0", "B00003CXO1", "B00009WVSL", "B00003CXSM", "B000NA1WDQ", "B00004BZIY", "B002AS464Q", "B000J103OI", "B000021Y7L", "B000ENC5YW", "B0002V7ON8", "B00009W5CA", "B00015YVDG", "B0009X75O2", "B0000JBALO", "0767803434", "6305065551", "B000MQC9H4", "6305692572", "B00013RC2U", "6305144168", "B00008979G", "B000CCBCAS", "0792846443", "B000M341QE"], "bought_together": ["B0001AVZA8", "B000YAF4MA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0001AVZA8", "B0038N9WKU", "B000YAF4MA", "B00013WWT8"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 5469}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.96, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "0767811100", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51KRRMHSAJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "As Good As It Gets"}

He's imprisoned for his troubles, and upon his release, mentors an impetuous pupil (Antonio Banderas, more suave than ever) in the fine arts of swordplay and triumphing over evil. Catherine Zeta-Jones capably portrays the beauty linked to both men--Zorro I's daughter, Zorro II's object of desire.The plotting contains few surprises, but the interplay between the three leads is always winning, and the winks to the swashbuckling genre are playful without ever being heavy-handed or campy.--David Kronke", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B00006ADFM", "B000CEXGAU", "0792839137", "6305428077", "B002PQKNRC", "B000A9QK8M", "B00641MFCK", "B0041KKBFE", "B000ENC5YW", "B008VR7TWG", "B0000A2ZU1", "B002GHHHP6", "B002VWNID6", "B0000WN140", "0800141601", "B0055CMM0O", "6305692688", "B000007T5P", "B003BJODK0", "B00000JQB5", "B0029R81BC", "B00005N5SB", "B00004XPPG", "B00005JKE1", "B000FO0AA6", "B000OT6V64", "B00005N5SA", "B00005ATZT", "0767803434", "0783233477", "B00000G3PA", "B00003CXQG", "B00003CXTA", "B00158K0QU", "0767836324", "B001LMAK88", "B00177YA1K", "B00D9EJFTQ", "B000JYW5BE", "B0049IHX2C", "B00005JN5E", "B0000B1OFL", "B000FUTVLY", "B000OLR8VY", "6304711905", "B003HKN52U", "B00008K76U", "B000U34PM6", "B00008G8M4", "0767817710", "B00006ZXSK", "B000AP04FG", "0800195175", "B00AEFZ2DG", "B00003CY0V", "B004P7CN5O", "B00005LOL0", "B0013BM63O"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00006ADFM", "B000CEXGAU", "0792839137", "6305428077"]}, "price": 15.21, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 1124295}, "asin": "0767823729", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41EQXJWFHRL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "One Fine Morning"}

{"description": "Could this be the funniest movie ever made? By any rational measure of comedy, this medieval romp from the Monty Python troupe certainly belongs on the short list of candidates. According toLeonard Maltin's Movie & Video Guide, it's \"recommended for fans only,\" but we say hogwash to that--you could be a complete newcomer to the Python phenomenon and still find this send-up of the Arthurian legend to be wet-your-pants hilarious. It's basically a series of sketches woven together as King Arthur's quest for the Holy Grail, with Graham Chapman as the King, Terry Gilliam as his simpleton sidekick Patsy, and the rest of the Python gang filling out a variety of outrageous roles. The comedy highlights are too numerous to mention, but once you've seen Arthur's outrageously bloody encounter with the ominous Black Knight (John Cleese), you'll know that nothing's sacred in the Python school of comedy. From holy hand grenades to killer bunnies to the absurdity of the three-headed knights who say \"Ni--!,\" this is the kind of movie that will strike you as fantastically funny or just plain silly, but why stop there? It's all over the map, and the pace lags a bit here and there, but for every throwaway gag the Pythons have invented, there's a bit of subtle business or grand-scale insanity that's utterly inspired. The sum of this madness is a movie that's beloved by anyone with a pulse and an irreverent sense of humor. If this movie doesn't make you laugh, you're almost certainly dead.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000G6BLWE", "0767827724", "0792844890", "B00AEFXDO6", "B00003CXC3", "B0006JGNB0", "B0009XRZ92", "B000G6BLW4", "B002LFPAUC", "B000M7XR9W", "B00AMSQBUI", "B00AMSQBRQ", "B00000IQBW", "B006C9VR4Q", "B000055Y0X", "B000E6ESIK", "B00005PJ6O", "B000GEIRSM", "B000BMY2LU", "B00AEFYPAC", "B00287Z18Y", "B000V4UFZK", "1929780699", "B001AGXEAG", "B000P0J09W", "B0001Y4LBY", "6305428263", "B0089Q1TPM", "B008RNYMPG", "B001G5T6GW", "B00005ALS0", "B00AEFY3MC", "B004ALIG0G", "B0001ZX0O2", "B0009RCPY8", "B00006FDCT", "B001ECDVKE", "B00005PJ6N", "B002BIULL2", "B004SEUJBE", "B0000A14TA", "B00004RJ73", "B00006LPGP", "B00AEFXXMI", "B000NJMJGG", "B004QSQMKE", "B003AWRMBA", "B00AG473GE", "B000ELJAEM", "0800195175", "B00005JMYI", "B00177YA1K", "B00000K3D4", "B00AEBBA2C", "B002NZK5V4", "B003ASLJPE", "B004L9GMBC", "B000A283AW", "B005S9EK5Y", "B000QQLVPQ", "B000Z8GZYW", "B000EQHXOG", "B002NZK5SW", "B004SIPA4G", "B00AEBB9DM", "B0050FXDDQ", "B002G1K82Q", "B00000JPH6", "B000077VR3", "B007LNBS2I"], "bought_together": ["B00003CXC3"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000E6ESIK", "B00003CXC3"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 33308}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 18.82, "brand": "", "asin": "0767824571", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51AAJB7EEQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Monty Python and the Holy Grail"}

{"description": "Unanimously hailed as one of the greatest masterpieces in the history of the motion picture,Seven Samuraihas inspired countless films modeled after its basic premise. But Akira Kurosawa's classic 1954 action drama has never been surpassed in terms of sheer power of emotion, kinetic energy, and dynamic character development. The story is set in the 1600s, when the residents of a small Japanese village are seeking protection against repeated attacks by a band of marauding thieves. Offering mere handfuls of rice as payment, they hire seven unemployed \"ronin\" (masterless samurai), including a boastful swordsman (Toshiro Mifune) who is actually a farmer's son desperately seeking glory and acceptance. The samurai get acquainted with but remain distant from the villagers, knowing that their assignment may prove to be fatal. The climactic battle with the raiding thieves remains one of the most breathtaking sequences ever filmed. It's poetry in hyperactive motion and one of Kurosawa's crowning cinematic achievements.

{"description": "Maverick film director Samuel Fuller was doing some of his best work in the late 1950s and early 1960s, and in the years since its release in 1963,Shock Corridorhas become a B-movie classic and a prime example of Fuller's gritty tabloid style. Never hesitant to explore the darkened corners of contemporary life, Fuller depicts the chambers of an insane asylum as a microcosm of American society, telling the story of a cynical, ambitious journalist (Peter Breck) whose obsessive quest for a Pulitzer Prize leads him into the depths of madness. To investigate a murder, the reporter goes undercover in a mental hospital, having convinced a psychiatrist that he needs treatment. Once inside the asylum, he pieces together clues to the murder, but his own mind begins to deteriorate until he's trapped in a downward spiral towards insanity. Fuller heightens the melodrama with his aggressive style of filmmaking (his next film,The Naked Kiss, proved even more effective), and his imaginative use of black-and-white cinematography (by noted cameraman Stanley Cortez) fills the movie with raw, emotional power. It's the kind of film one would expect from a rebellious director on the Hollywood fringe, and that's whyShock Corridorremains an enduring low-budget examination of the \"rat race\" and the consequences of pursuing success at any cost. The Criterion Collection DVD presents the film in its original 1.85:1 aspect ratio, and a rarely seen color dream sequence has been fully restored.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0047P5FTA", "B00012L786", "B00005AUK9", "B0024FAG6W", "B00005AUKD", "B00AQ6J5YA", "B000QXDFS0", "B001GCATWA", "B00005JKGX", "B00ICWO1LC", "B0007PALOI", "B00005V6N6", "B0002V7O0Q", "B00DZP1BUU", "B0001US78Q", "B000AQKUH2", "B001LMU1C8", "B0007GAG42", "B00DZP1C9K", "1559409002", "B004C2523M", "B005152C9G", "B0006Z2NE0", "B00005QAPH", "B0024FAG80", "B000025RE7", "B0007989Y8", "B004ALIG4M", "B00I116MVQ", "B00065GX64", "B000BB14IA", "B00005BHW6", "0780022076", "B00CUKTHES", "B0007TKNLA", "B000MTEFOQ", "B001LMU19G", "B000093NQZ", "B00H8J2NTC", "B00007L4I6", "B001BEK8C4", "B004NWPY3E", "0780023099", "B000B8384Q", "B007N5YJMA", "B003ZYU3U0", "B003ICZW7I", "B000M2E3GI", "B001CW7ZT4", "B00005BH23", "B00EL6A7XE", "B005152C7S", "B00180R072", "B0007MANYY", "B00005A8TX", "0780022270", "B00000C0QO", "B00AQ6J6H6", "B00004TJKI", "B006TTC5MM", "B000244EYW", "B000B83846", "0780022823", "B00E18QKJ2", "B004WPYO7E", "B0002JP2OS", "B00IKM5OCO", "B009RWRINE", "B00007ELDG", "B001D8W7F4", "B0009X7682", "B00005N7Z1", "0783228457", "B000067IY4", "0780021134", "B001WLMOL4", "B00000F3CD", "B001BSBBIK", "B008Y5OVZ8", "B0024FAG8A", "B007N5YK10", "078002205X", "B006ML50SS", "B00006673L", "B00000IOKV", "6305999872", "B00AQ6J64O", "B00393SG42", "B00DZP1BVO", "B00AQ6J56S", "B0009X75EC", "B000AQKUG8", "B00005QAPJ", "B0012KSUUE", "0780022041", "B00004YZFR", "B005HK13S6", "B000B8380A", "B00005JLV7", "B004NWPY7A"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0024FAG6W", "B003WKL6XA", "0780022041", "078002205X"]}, "price": 24.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 248126}, "asin": "0780021096", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51NZARPYHEL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Shock Corridor (The Criterion Collection)"}

{"description": "It seems that thrillers these days--even good ones--are all about scene-chewing bad guys, cute retorts fit for the Dennis Miller show, and one big special effect to end the movie. Well, something likeThe Peacemaker, the first feature film from DreamWorks, puts the record straight. Here is an expertly paced thriller with a sensible villain, smart instead of cute dialogue, and a focus on action instead of special effects. It's not original, just solid. It's the second of these energetic and effective thrillers that writer Michael Schiffer (Crimson Tide) has penned. The White House Nuclear Smuggling Group tracks down 10 stolen nuclear bombs after a suspicious train wreck in Russia. The acting head of the department (Nicole Kidman) and her military field officer (George Clooney) are off to Europe to track down the bombs. Instead of a Gary Oldman-Bruce Dern madman,The Peacemaker's heavy is an unknown Romanian actor (Marcul Iures) playing a Bosnian rebel who works passionately and quietly. This may be a popcorn movie, but it uses the ripe emotions of the Bosnian War to create tension. This is the best film vehicle yet for the overwhelming charisma of George Clooney as a quick witted, generally warm Oliver North type who will seek deadly vengeance without pause. He's matched very well by the professional polish of Nicole Kidman who is showing great flexibility in dividing her roles between serious and fun fare.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792133153", "6303696813", "0783227264", "079212569X", "0783223218", "0792116887"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 489054}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.92, "brand": "", "asin": "0783224079", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51MXMH3PZ1L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Peacemaker [VHS]"}

{"description": "Heavy-metal golf with Adam Sandler, a 1996 dry run of the wild-man-athlete formula that paid off so handsomely inThe Waterboy. There are some irresistibly funny sequences, although you may hate yourself for laughing at the mean-spirited slapstick. This isn't a classic golf comedy, like the Bill Murray vehicleCaddyshack, but as a hot-tempered would- be hockey player who finds an unexpected m&#xE9;tier as a power golfer, Sandler has a short-fuse shtick that's effectively deployed. He's like a punk rocker gleefully out of his element, puncturing the country-club atmosphere by using the fairway as a private mosh pit. The action gets repetitive beyond the midpoint, and a subplot involving Gilmore's lovable grandma and her problems with the IRS is dismayingly sappy. Sandler's iconoclasm is mostly window dressing; there's no conceptual or satirical daring in his kind of \"outrageousness.\" The strong supporting cast includes Christopher McDonald as Gilmore's smug rival on the links, Julie Bowen as a perky publicist, and, in a memorable bout of fisticuffs with our hero, game-show host Bob Barker. Director Dennis Dugan  (Problem Child) himself plays Doug Thompson, the golf-tour supervisor.--David Chute", "related": {"also_bought": ["0788816454", "6300989003"], "bought_together": ["0788816454"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 177944}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 0.49, "brand": "", "asin": "0783219105", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51G6A1H2BAL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Happy Gilmore [VHS]"}

{"description": "Who would have guessed that this clever, fast-paced creature feature from 1990 would become a beloved miniclassic?Tremorsdidn't actually break any new ground (even though its tunneling worm monsters certainly did), but it revved up the classic monster-movie formulas of the 1950s with such energetic enthusiasm and humor that it made everything old seem new again. It's also got a cast full of enjoyable actors who clearly had a lot of fun making the film, and director Ron Underwood strikes just the right balance of comedy and terror as a band of small-town rednecks battles a lot of really nasty-looking giant worms. The special effects are great, the one-liners fly fast and furious between heroes Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward (and yes, that's country star Reba McEntire packin' awesome firepower), and it's all done with the kind of flair one rarely associates with goofy monster flicks like this.

{"description": "Meet Joe Blackseemed almost fated to fail when it was released in 1998, but this romantic fantasy--a remake of 1934'sDeath Takes a Holiday--deserves a chance at life after box-office death. Although many moviegoers were turned off by director Martin Brest's overindulgent three-hour running time, those who gear into its deliberate pace will find thatMeet Joe Blackoffers ample reward for your attention.Brad Pitt plays Death with a capital D, enjoying some time on Earth by inhabiting the body of a young man who'd been killed in a shockingly sudden pedestrian-auto impact. Before long, Death has ingratiated himself with a wealthy industrialist (Anthony Hopkins) and pursues romance with the man's beautiful daughter (newcomer Claire Forlani), whom he'd briefly encountered while still an earthbound human. Under the assumed identity of \"Joe Black,\" he samples all the pleasures that corporeal life has to offer--power, romance, sex, and such enticing pleasures as peanut butter by the spoonful.But Death has a job to do, andMeet Joe Blackaddresses the heart-wrenching dilemma that arises when either father or daughter (the plot keeps us guessing) must confront his or her inevitable demise. The film takes its own sweet time to establish this emotional crisis and the love that binds Hopkins's semidysfunctional family so closely together. But if you've stuck with the story this far, you may find yourself surprisingly affected. And ifMeet Joe Blackhas really won you over, you'll more than appreciate the care and affection that gives the film a depth and richness that so many critics chose to ignore.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0800135954", "B00005PJ8I"], "bought_together": ["0800135954"], "also_viewed": ["6304151306"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 485735}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 0.01, "brand": "", "asin": "078322706X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51yPbLwH%2BFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Meet Joe Black [VHS]"}

{"description": "Writer-director-composer Vincent Gallo and Christina Ricci star in this quirky and deliberately grimy little movie. Gallo plays Billy Brown, recently released from prison and unable to find so much as a decent bathroom in his cold hometown. Billy's parents are unaware that he's been locked up; in a pathetic attempt to impress them with how successful he's become, he hits on the novel plan of kidnapping young dance student Layla (Ricci) and forcing her to play the role of his wife. Billy's distant--to say the least--parents are played to the hilt by Anjelica Huston and Ben Gazzara, Huston in particular bringing a demented glee to her role as Billy's football-obsessed mother. As the movie unfolds, we learn more about Billy's tormented childhood and unfortunate tendency to bet on the Bills in the Super Bowl. Gallo boldly throws himself into the task of playing a complete sleazebag, and Ricci does lovely standout work as the one ray of hope in the grinding darkness of Billy's life. This odd little love story is just the thing to make you feel better about your own relationship--especially if you're not in one.--Ali Davis", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00013EY7Q", "0790733927", "6300182770", "B0009RRUKW", "B000286RJI", "630156118X"], "also_viewed": ["B000002J1Y"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 387147}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.95, "brand": "", "asin": "0783229585", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5108BYQ9GYL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Buffalo 66 [VHS]"}

His newfound genius makes him an overnight  sensation when he gets all the answers right on a  college quiz show.

Caught  up between battling college deans (Joe Flynn and Alan Hewitt) and a dangerous  mobster (Cesar Romero), Dexter soon learns friends are more valuable than  money.  This movie, released in 1970, is a true romp with silly situations and madcap misadventures. The size of the computer itself is now good for a sight gag. It's likable but goofy, with  no real weight.

{"description": "Stanley Kubrick'sThe Shiningis less an adaptation of Stephen King's bestselling horror novel than a complete reimagining of it from the inside out. In King's book, the Overlook Hotel is a haunted place that takes possession of its off-season caretaker and provokes him to murderous rage against his wife and young son. Kubrick's movie is an existential Road Runner cartoon (his steadicam scurrying through the hotel's labyrinthine hallways), in which the cavernously empty spaces inside the Overlook mirror the emptiness in the soul of the blocked writer, who's settled in for a long winter's hibernation. As many have pointed out, King's protagonist goes mad, but Kubrick's Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) is Looney Tunes from the moment we meet him--all arching eyebrows and mischievous grin. (Both Nicholson and Shelley Duvall reach new levels of hysteria in their performances, driven to extremes by the director's fanatical demands for take after take after take.)The Shiningis terrifying--but not in the way fans of the novel might expect. When it was redone as a TV miniseries (reportedly because of King's dissatisfaction with the Kubrick film), the famous topiary-animal attack (which was deemed impossible to film in 1980) was there--but the deeper horror was lost. Kubrick'sThe Shininggets under your skin and chills your bones; it stays with you, inhabits you, haunts you.

{"description": "One of the key films of the 1970s, John Boorman'sDeliveranceis a nightmarish adaptation of poet-novelist James Dickey's book about various kinds of survival in modern America. The story concerns four Atlanta businessmen of various male stripe: Jon Voight's character is a reflective, civilized fellow, Burt Reynolds plays a strapping hunter-gatherer in urban clothes, Ned Beatty is a sweaty, weak-willed boy-man, and Ronny Cox essays a spirited, neighborly type. Together they decide to answer the ancient call of men testing themselves against the elements and set out on a treacherous ride on the rapids of an Appalachian river. What they don't understand until it is too late is that they have ventured into Dickey's variation on the American underbelly, a wild, lawless, dangerous (and dangerously inbred) place isolated from the gloss of the late 20th century. In short order, the four men dig deep into their own suppressed primitiveness, defending themselves against armed cretins, facing the shock of real death on their carefully planned, death-defying adventure, and then squarely facing the suspicions of authority over their concealed actions. Boorman, a master teller of stories about individuals on peculiarly mythical journeys, does a terrifying and beautiful job of revealing the complexity of private and collective character--the way one can never be the same after glimpsing the sharp-clawed survivor in one's soul.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00000FZCU", "6305123616", "0783222955", "6300214060"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 659130}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 10.0, "brand": "", "asin": "0790732009", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/513K3CXF8QL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Deliverance (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]"}
{"description": "When the owner of the hapless Minnesota Twins (talk about art imitating life) dies and leaves his grandson (Luke Edwards) the team in his will, the 12-year-old decides to manage the team himself. Aside from the obvious headline value of his move, no one seems to like the idea and the kid finds himself battling for his fledgling managerial career. Eventually, however, he wins the confidence of his favorite player (Timothy Busfield) and before long has the team playing like kids: for the fun of it, rather than the money. (Now there's a concept.) Though billed as a family movie, the saccharine level is high enough to scare off most adults.

{"description": "This first sequel toDirty Harrywas written by a couple of strong voices, writer-directors Michael Cimino (The Deer Hunter) and John Milius (Farewell to the King). But that doesn't mean the film is particularly good. After Don Siegel's ferociously dark style in the first movie, Ted Post's blocky, television-ish direction inMagnum Forceis a huge letdown. The story doesn't win any prizes, either. Eastwood's San Francisco detective Harry Callahan (apparently having retrieved his badge after throwing it away at the end ofDirty Harry) takes on a vigilante squad within the city's police force. David Soul is pretty convincing as the major spokesman for these right-wing avengers. Eastwood, on the other hand, had already turned Callahan from fascinating outsider in Siegel's film to purveyor of tough-guy shtick in this one.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["079073172X", "0790731975", "630118663X", "B00004TYS8", "0790751267", "6302909023", "0792116887", "B00005Q4GZ", "6300269639", "6300246868", "630196733X", "6300181723", "6303020089", "B000007PI9", "630018627X", "0792835018"], "bought_together": ["0790731975"], "also_viewed": ["079073172X", "0790751267", "630118663X", "0790731975"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 450539}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.39, "brand": "", "asin": "0790733390", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71GSJPACQHL._SY300_.gif", "title": "Magnum Force [VHS]"}
{"description": "Consciously crafted by director George Stevens as a piece of American mythmaking, Shane is on nearly everyone's shortlist of great movie Westerns. A buckskin knight, Shane (Alan Ladd) rides into the middle of a range war between farmers and cattlemen, quickly siding with the \"sod-busters.\" While helping a kindly farmer (Van Heflin), Shane falls platonically in love with the man's wife (Jean Arthur, in the last screen performance of a marvelous career). Though the showdowns are exciting, and the story simple but involving, what most people will remember about this movie is the friendship between the stoical Shane and the young son of the farmers. The kid is played by Brandon De Wilde, who gives one of the most amazing child performances in the movies; his parting scene with Shane is guaranteed to draw tears from even the most stonyhearted moviegoer. And speaking of stony hearts, Jack Palance made a sensational impression as the evil gunslinger sent to clean house--he has fewer lines of dialogue than he has lines in his magnificently craggy face, but he makes them count.

Kurt Russell is back as the terminally cynical one-eyed action hero Snake Plissken who, this time, has been coerced into saving the world in Los Angeles. It's 2013 and L.A. is now an island maximum security prison off the coast of California. Snake has 10 hours to find a doomsday weapon that's fallen into the hands of revolutionaries before he dies of a virus with which he's been injected. But the action is clumsy and unimaginative: lots of shootouts and very little suspense. Even the bad guys aren't particularly inventive; only Pam Grier, as a transsexual gang leader, strikes any sparks.

{"description": "Mel Gibson's Oscar-winning 1995Braveheartis an impassioned epic about William Wallace, the 13th-century Scottish leader of a popular revolt against England's tyrannical Edward I (Patrick McGoohan). Gibson cannily plays Wallace as a man trying to stay out of history's way until events force his hand, an attribute that instantly resonates with several of the actor's best-known roles, especiallyMad Max. The subsequent camaraderie and courage Wallace shares in the field with fellow warriors is pure enough and inspiring enough to bring envy to a viewer, and even as things go wrong for Wallace in the second half, the film does not easily cave in to a somber tone. One of the most impressive elements is the originality with which Gibson films battle scenes, featuring hundreds of extras wielding medieval weapons.

{"description": "A man calling himself Henry Faber is actually \"the Needle,\" a German spy in England bearing critical information on Allied invasion plans that he must deliver personally to the Fhrer. He's so named because of his preferred method of assassination, the stiletto. He is a coldly calculating sociopath, emotionlessly focused on the task at hand, whether the task is to signal a U-boat or to gut a witness to avoid exposure.\n\nOn his way back to Germany, a fierce storm strands him on Storm Island, occupied only by a woman named Lucy (Kate Nelligan), her disabled husband, their son, and their shepherd, Tom. A romance develops between the woman and the spy, due to an estrangement of affections between Lucy and her husband, whose accident has rendered him emotionally crippled as well.\n\nThe love affair suggests there's a sympathetic personality buried somewhere inside the Nazi spy, though he remains enigmatic. Early on, we discover that he may not enjoy the hand life has dealt him. When a courier asks him about the way he lives, and \"What else can one do?\" the Needle answers, \"One can just stop.\"\n\nLucy realizes that her lover has been lying after she discovers her husband's dead body. \"The Needle\" must get to Tom's radio in time to report to his superiors the exact location of the D-Day invasion. Lucy is the Allies' last chance. He is reluctant to harm her, but she has no such qualms and shoots him as he tries to escape in a boat. Additional footage tells of Faber's activities four years before and of David's accident, while another ending finds Lucy receiving help from British Intelligence.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005QCVP", "6303057225", "B0000040EJ", "0783240171", "6302529441", "6302700949", "6302909023", "6302238331", "6302413435", "0790743213", "0800132009", "0792837096", "6300181340", "0790733463", "6301971809", "630150528X", "6300215741", "6300185168", "6302717736", "6302529484", "6302779782", "6300216748", "630280051X", "6303451535", "6303168507", "0783221347", "079074886X", "B00024I2TK", "079284517X", "6303082866", "0783235623", "B00008R9K9"], "bought_together": ["B00005QCVP"], "also_viewed": ["B0039A9M7K", "B004CQZF8U", "0451204530", "0451215710", "0062020889", "0525953094"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 312020}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.91, "brand": "", "asin": "0792835050", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516X8HB6Y7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Eye of the Needle [VHS]"}

It's really just another martial-arts movie, dressed down with near-future trash and dirty sets that have \"low budget\" written all over them. Van Damme plays the protective escort for a half-human, half-cyborg woman whose programming contains a possible cure for a plague that's threatening to wipe out the entire population of Earth. But the woman is kidnapped by Van Damme's evil nemesis (is there any other kind?) while they are en route to her Atlanta headquarters. That leads Van Damme right into a lion's den of sadomasochistic torture and torment. If you've made it this far (and if you have, why?), you're probably a founding member of the Jean-Claude Van Damme fan club. To everyone else: Don't say you weren't warned--this is the kind of movie in which naming characters after electric guitars (Van Damme's character is named \"Gibson Rickenbacker\") qualifies as clever screenwriting.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0002S94CK", "0783114885", "B0000542CD", "B00441GYY2", "0783228465", "B00006RCOC", "B0000542CC", "B000GRUMSC", "0767804252", "076780970X", "B001M9ELQC", "6305259429", "B001T21R5U", "B00596WEVI", "B0087OULG4", "0783227892", "0783225520", "6305551235", "B00005N5QW", "B001L2ZSJO", "B0099KJFJ4", "B0011VIO46", "0783226748", "B000022TSJ", "B00A34LX9A", "B002TVQ4CG", "B0006JGIQU", "B0043EFAJK", "B000N3T0E6", "B00HVFA2VE", "B002U6CJCO", "B0002848WQ", "B001PWY4NG", "0767821548", "B0002J58HO", "B001FWRYYC", "B0015FQZIK", "B006A8XFUI", "B0045HCJG2", "B0041QSZLA", "B00HODLW6C", "B000QXDCLU", "B001B3LIOC", "B005HIBWUW", "0783219660", "B00AKGG828", "B000GDH9IW", "B00J5LXT6M", "B000RW3VCK", "6305767866", "B00GB0OVY4", "1558908846", "B00AEFYDM2", "0790729334", "B0001Z37HM", "B0021FP3EA", "B00070FX5U", "B0050MB5NO", "B00J5G1P2W", "B00HZMZ2FE", "B0001VTPW2", "0767802454", "B00005O5B5", "B0002O7XUE", "B00005V4XK", "B00005JA8B", "B008XAT1HM", "B001W72VPW", "B00069L0Y0", "B000LC4Z7Q", "0767817745", "B00004STDN", "B00DYXCHN8", "B00009MEBX", "B00005JP3R", "B00CPKZLUC", "B0004Z33F0", "B00005N89J", "B0045HCIWW", "B00C7A8WZQ", "B000A2IPQY", "B00FEHCPZ2", "B000MEYKEG", "B000E8QVCO", "B0015XHP2C", "6305245487", "B00GDDNFDW", "B002ZG98LO", "B00005OOQ1", "B00004Y87O", "6304712499", "B0030BOCL4", "B004SIP6WW", "B002SG7Z7A", "B002E2QH8Q", "B00AEFXPMG", "B001T21R50", "B0045HCJT4", "6305428158", "B00AEFYXQI"], "bought_together": ["B00006RCOC", "0783228465"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003R3JNTQ", "0783114885", "B008NP4ZUU", "B0002S94CK"]}, "price": 17.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 124727}, "asin": "0792835735", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51MTZXM0F2L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Cyborg"}
{"description": "Jasmin (Marianne S&auml;gebrecht), a German tourist, has just walked off from her husband at the side of the road in the middle of the Mojave Desert; Brenda (CCH Pounder) has just kicked her husband out of the roadside cafe-motel they operate. When Jasmin arrives at the cafe, the two begin developing a prickly but ultimately rewarding friendship. Many other movies have tried to duplicateBagdad Cafe's mixture of loose storytelling, off-kilter metaphors, and rich emotions, but most often these imitators leave out the random chaos of life and the awkward pain of change thatBagdad Cafecaptures with such a gentle touch.Bagdad Cafeearns both its quirkiness and its sentiment by keeping one foot firmly rooted in reality. Director Percy Adlon teamed with star S&auml;gebrecht in two other similarly offbeat movies,SugarbabyandRosalie Goes Shopping; his more recent features without her haven't been as successful. Still, he continues to be noted for his odd but lively use of color filters and jagged editing.Bagdad Cafealso features the great Jack Palance (Shane,Requiem for a Heavyweight,City Slickers) playing an easy-going painter; the opportunity to be an ordinary person, rather than his usual wicked fiends, brings out a delightful mischief in Palance. Pounder, who usually gets small supporting parts, deserves another role like this to take advantage of her remarkable range.

The guy they finally choose doesn't last long--they find him dead from a drug overdose along with a suitcase full of money that he no longer needs. They decide to keep the money; this of course requires that they discreetly dispose of the body, which proves to be a gruesome, traumatic business. They begin to suspect each other of betrayal and become increasingly deranged.

{"description": "Surprisingly lighthearted and witty, Paul Rudnick'sJeffrey(based on hisoff-Broadway play)  was one of the first films to tackle the AIDS crisis without patting itself on the back or offering everything up in a sobering movie-of-the-week scenario. The titular Jeffrey (Steven Weber) is a happy-go-lucky gay man who suddenly comes face to face with the fact that AIDS has turned sex into something \"radioactive.\" Paranoid in the extreme, he vows to become celibate--at just about the same time that hunky Steve (The Pretender's Michael&nbsp;T. Weiss) saunters into his life, eyes twinkling and hormones raging. The only problem is that Steve, for all his muscles and charm, is HIV-positive, thus setting Jeffrey's deepest fears into motion. When it was written in 1995,Jeffreystruck a nerve in mining the fear that a number of gay men felt during the height of the AIDS crisis. Even just a few years later, though, Jeffrey's paranoia (what, he's never heard of condoms?) seems dated, and his behavior more self-damaging than self-aware--basically, he needs a slap upside the head as opposed to therapy. Still, Rudnick (who went on to pen the more mainstreamIn and Out) is never one to pass up a witty one-liner or an opportunity to poke fun at anyone, andJeffreynow stands as a hilarious, sometimes poignant portrait of gay single life and the perils of dating in a paranoid time. Weber's Jeffrey is simultaneously open to the possibilities of life and fearful to embrace them, and Weiss is, well... gorgeous and funny and sexy beyond belief. Still, it's Patrick Stewart, as Jeffrey's interior decorator best friend, who effortlessly steals the film with his cutting wit; in his mouth, Rudnick's lines are priceless gems. With a host of amazing cameos, including Sigourney Weaver as a conceited New Age maven, Kathy Najimy as her sad-sack follower, Christine Baranski as a high-society hostess for a roundup-themed charity dinner, and a top-form Nathan Lane as a gay priest who seems to have discovered the meaning of life--literally.--Mark Englehart", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 470683}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.99, "brand": "", "asin": "0792845269", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51N4YQ91S0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Jeffrey [VHS]"}

{"description": "Mary Harron's feature--which picked up a Special Jury Award at the 1996 Sundance Film Festival for lead actress and independent film mainstay Lili Taylor--is a highly suspect mishmash of golly-gee counterculture reconstruction and inflammatory agitprop. Harron re-creates the ultimately violent relationship of motor-mouth street freak writer-prostitute-lesbian-gun-wielding assailant Valerie Solanas (Taylor) and pop artist Andy Warhol (Jared Harris) in the late 1960s, which ended in Solanas's assault on Warhol for his charmingly noncommittal responses to her search for a patron. It's a great idea for a film, butI Shot Andy Warholis truly at odds with itself. Harron's modular construction of the story--part naive reenactment of the instant-celebrity life at Warhol's studio, part celebration of Solanas's subversive ramblings, part investigation into the roots of her hyper-victimization at, apparently, the hands of all men--is ultimately a shell game that allows the writer-director to avoid taking a clear stand on Solanas's bizarro politics.

{"description": "Winner of five Academy Awards including Best Picture, Actor, and Screenplay,Kramer vs. Kramerremains as powerfully moving today as it was when released in 1979, simply because its drama will remain relevant for couples of any generation. Adapted by director Robert Benton from the novel by Avery Corman, this is perhaps the finest, most evenly balanced film ever made about the failure of marriage and the tumultuous shift of parental roles. It begins when Joanna Kramer (Meryl Streep) bluntly informs her husband Ted (Dustin Hoffman) that she's leaving him, just as his advertising career is advancing and demanding most of his waking hours. Self-involvement is just one of the film's underlying themes, along with the search for identity that prompts Joanna to leave Ted with their first-grade son (Justin Henry), who now finds himself living with a workaholic parent he barely knows. Juggling his domestic challenge with professional deadlines, Ted is further pressured when his wife files for custody of their son. This legal battle forms the dramatic spine of the film, but its power is derived from Benton's flawlessly observant script and the superlative performances of his entire cast. Because Benton refuses to assign blame and deals fairly with both sides of a devastating dilemma, the film arrives at equal levels of pain, growth, and integrity under emotionally stressful circumstances. That gives virtually every scene the unmistakable ring of truth--a quality of dramatic honestly that makesKramer vs. Kramernot merely a classic tearjerker, but one of the finest American dramas of its decade.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["630273973X", "0783240171", "B00005NQGQ", "B00AEBB95K", "6301627091", "6300182304", "0792835018", "B004IFIMT4", "6301247485", "6304935811"], "bought_together": ["630273973X"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 256640}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.95, "brand": "", "asin": "0800106032", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51J3PVCJM3L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Kramer vs. Kramer [VHS]"}
{"description": "Here's a model for adapting a novel into a movie. The bestseller by James Jones, a frank and hard-hitting look at military life, could not possibly be made into a film in 1953 without considerably altering its length and bold subject matter. Yet screenwriter Daniel Taradash and director Fred Zinnemann (both of whom won Oscars for their work) pared it down and cleaned it up, without losing the essential texture of Jones's tapestry. The setting is an army base in Hawaii in 1941. Montgomery Clift, in a superb performance, plays a bugler who refuses to fight for the company boxing team; he has reasons for giving up the sport. His refusal results in harsh treatment from the company commander, whose bored wife (Deborah Kerr) is having an affair with the tough-but-fair sergeant (Burt Lancaster). You remember--the scene with the two of them embracing on the beach, as the surf crashes in. The supporting players are as good as the leads: Frank Sinatra and Donna Reed won Oscars (and Sinatra revitalized his entire career), and Ernest Borgnine entered the gallery of all-time movie villains, as the stockade sergeant who makes Sinatra miserable. Zinnemann's work is efficient but also evocative, capturing the time and place beautifully, the tropical breezes as well as the lazy prewar indulgence. This one is deservedly a classic.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305261296", "6302226899", "6302413435", "6305123616", "079284517X", "6302413400", "0783221347", "0783222955", "B000005PPB", "0800113055", "6301586026", "6303057225", "6300215644", "6303402070", "6300215741", "0790743159", "6301976983", "6302877873", "B0000048YM", "630150528X", "0793910323", "6302000661", "1558807780", "6300216012", "6302120624", "6302842263", "6302700949", "6302360978", "6300246965", "6304111398", "6301628454", "6304291698", "0800132009", "6301578805", "6301706587", "6301975987", "6300216721", "6302593220", "6301670140", "630442972X", "0792107683", "6301670159", "6304359705", "6301955293", "6301798503", "6301976622", "6301599225", "1558808590", "B00000F13M", "6300183890", "6300267865", "0792101448", "6301797957", "6301973232", "0782008348", "6301564456", "0792110269", "6301798732", "B000M5BRX2", "6301969294", "0783235623", "6302484391", "0790743213", "6300215962", "6300147355", "630266232X", "6300182304", "6303282237", "0792841026", "0790733935", "0792837967", "6301959728", "0783236352", "6302779782", "6302640504", "B0000048YO", "6304383169", "6302238331", "6301640667", "6300214826", "6300181421", "6303029027", "6300181340", "6304429274", "0792837096", "6301973259", "6303560040", "6302753198", "6304056915", "0792837630", "6303943004", "6302797713", "0782006779", "6301798759", "6302278929", "6300246868", "630533577X", "0792837649", "6304935811", "0800100816"], "bought_together": ["6305123616"], "also_viewed": ["6304117752", "0783222955", "0783221347", "6303215734", "6304429274"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 203870}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.0, "brand": "", "asin": "0800100832", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4157079C8HL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "From Here to Eternity [VHS]"}
{"description": "Bill Murray does warmth in his most consistently effective post-Stripescomedy, a romantic fantasy about a wacky weatherman forced to relive one strange day over and over again, until he gets it right. Snowed in during a road-trip expedition to watch the famous groundhog encounter his shadow, Murray falls into a time warp that is never explained but pays off so richly that it doesn't need to be. The elaborate loop-the-loop plot structure cooked up by screenwriter Danny Rubin is crystal-clear every step of the way, but it's Murray's world-class reactive timing that makes the jokes explode, and we end up looking forward to each new variation. He squeezes all the available juice out of every scene. Without forcing the issue, he makes us understand why this fly-away personality responds so intensely to the radiant sanity of the TV producer played by Andie MacDowell. The blissfully clueless Chris Elliott (Cabin Boy) is Murray's nudnik cameraman.--David Chute", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00004RJ73", "B00287Z18Y", "6305609764", "B00005PJ6O", "B007P9HW3M", "0790740044", "B00AEFXXMI", "0783227388", "6305236569", "B00000IQBW", "B000E33W1W", "0804141444", "B0009RCPY8", "B0019HQICW", "B001AGXEAG", "B00AEFXDO6", "0767818105", "0792844890", "B002O3Z4YI", "B0000A14TA", "B0014Z4OMU", "B000K7VHTQ", "B00AEBBA2M", "B00005Y71F", "B00AEBB9SM", "B002GOAGZC", "B000G6BLW4", "B001IHJ988", "B00008G8LM", "B001LXIDVI", "B000QQLVPQ", "B005LL817W", "B001LMAK9W", "B00AEBB9DM", "0767806808", "B008R65XKQ", "B000G6BLWE", "B00003CXC3", "B00005O5CM", "B000065V3P", "B00005JM4Q", "B00AEBB9E6", "B000ELJAEM", "B00AEFYS2M", "B00AEFY0F2", "0767836324", "B002T51X4Q", "0800195175", "B0009X760U", "B000A3XYIM", "B000VBIGD6", "B000069HYF", "B00003CXR4", "0790742071", "B00AEFY3MC", "B000PHVZNE", "B0000YTP02", "B000E6ESI0", "B000YDBPAM", "B007Y1NR1W", "B00158K0QU", "B00006FMUW", "B00BLN4UPG", "B00AEFYM2S", "B000HT3PPG", "B000056HEA", "B000068NNU", "B0045HCJ7G", "B000V4UFZK", "B004GJYRA0", "B004AOECXI", "B000YAF4MA", "B00AEFXPG2", "B0045HCIY0"], "bought_together": ["B00004RJ73", "B00287Z18Y"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00004RJ73", "B00005PJ6O", "B000E33W1W", "B00287Z18Y"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 107101}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.42, "brand": "", "asin": "080017948X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21XPDM6RK1L.jpg", "title": "Groundhog Day"}

{"description": "Francis Ford Coppola returns to Stoker's novel for this umpteenth take of the Transylvanian bloodsucker. Gary Oldman plays the vampire, Dracula, doomed to be a creature of the night after forsaking God but aroused by the image of a British woman (Winona Ryder) who resembles his own lost love. Oldman does well by the monster, even if he doesn't register much personality in the process, and Anthony Hopkins is a little overachieving as the vampire killer Van Helsing. The rest of the cast is serviceable, except Keanu Reeves, who--not atypically--is wooden and somehow empty. Coppola seems to approach the film as chunks of experimental opportunity, some of which work out all right while others are mannered or even foolish. What is undeniable is the tremendous buzz of the film's energy, particularly in a fantastic middle sequence that plays like a psychedelic nightmare.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000059XXZ", "0767819187"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 628165}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.95, "brand": "", "asin": "0800137884", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/512X6W16VZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Bram Stoker's Dracula (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]"}
{"description": "Director David Lean's masterful 1957 realization of PierreBoulle's novel remains a benchmark for war films, and a deeply absorbing movie by any standard--like most of Lean's canon,The Bridge on the River Kwaiachieves a richness in theme, narrative, and characterization that transcends genre.The story centers on a Japanese prison camp isolated deep in the jungles of Southeast Asia, where the remorseless Colonel Saito (Sessue Hayakawa) has been charged with building a vitally important railway bridge. His clash of wills with a British prisoner, the charismatic Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guinness), escalates into a duel of honor, Nicholson defying his captor's demands to win concessions for his troops. How the two officers reach a compromise, and Nicholson becomes obsessed with building that bridge, provides the story's thematic spine; the parallel movement of a team of commandos dispatched to stop the project, led by a British major (Jack Hawkins) and guided by an American escapee (William Holden), supplies the story's suspense and forward momentum.Shot on location in Sri Lanka,Kwaimoves with a careful, even deliberate pace that survivors of latter-day, high-concept blockbusters might find lulling--Lean doesn't pander to attention deficit disorders with an explosion every 15 minutes. Instead, he guides us toward the intersection of the two plots, accruing remarkable character details through extraordinary performances. Hayakawa's cruel camp commander is gradually revealed as a victim of his own sense of honor, Holden's callow opportunist proves heroic without softening his nihilistic edge, and Guinness (who won a Best Actor Oscar, one of the production's seven wins) disappears as only he can into Nicholson's brittle, duty-driven, delusional psychosis. His final glimpse of self-knowledge remains an astonishing moment--story, character, and image coalescing with explosive impact.Like Lean'sLawrence of Arabia,The Bridge on the River Kwaihas been beautifully restored and released in a highly recommended widescreen version that preserves its original aspect ratio.--Sam Sutherland", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302909023", "6304935811", "6304071876", "0800116917", "630150528X", "6301966317", "B0000040EJ", "6303168507", "0783222955", "6300181472", "0800113055", "0783221347", "6303057225", "6301797906", "0783235593", "6300181340", "6304151306", "6304196954", "6301965760", "B00005Q4GY", "6303494390", "6301977742", "6304291698", "6300988473", "6304117752", "6302797616", "B00007JME0", "630382336X", "0790752395", "B00005A1VH", "6301115430", "6300183513", "6302529441", "B000005PFL", "B00000F13T", "6304765347", "630274721X", "0782008348", "B000059HGY", "6301662954", "6300247031", "630018224X", "6301670140", "0792838408", "6304359675", "6304039522", "6300215601", "6304366078", "6300246965", "6300215539", "6303823351", "0800100832", "6301628454", "6300216721", "630407185X", "6304233639", "6300251152", "6300268748", "0790744589", "0790734060", "B00005Q4GZ", "0792116887", "6301798066", "0790701251", "6301976983", "6301972066", "B00004RFFA", "0800125762", "079212569X", "0792133153", "0790743213", "630442972X", "6301969049", "6300214540", "0783231482", "6300270025", "B00004TYS8", "6300183211", "6301587375", "B00000K3AN", "6300182533", "6301973259", "6304397941", "6301969251", "6300271315", "6303052223", "B00004RGUU", "0783235623", "B000062XM6", "6304458975", "B00004WIDB", "6305237115", "6301965701", "6302415853", "6303029027", "B000005PE7", "B0001DI5W6", "0792837533", "6301662946"], "bought_together": ["6302909023", "6301966317"], "also_viewed": ["0790743213", "6304071876", "B00BBND56G", "B000059HH1", "6305123616", "630233683X", "0783222955", "0783221347", "6304039522", "6300183513", "B000054OW2", "1558803602", "6301662954"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 223097}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.99, "brand": "", "asin": "0800132009", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51PF507DBSL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Bridge on the River Kwai [VHS]"}

{"description": "Overview\nFormer vice president Al Gore shares his concerns on the pressing issue of global warming in this documentary. A long-time environmental activist, Gore first became aware of evidence on global warming in the 1970s, and since leaving public office he has become a passionate advocate for large- and small-scale changes in our laws and lifestyles that could help alleviate this crisis. An Inconvenient Truth records a multi-media presentation hosted by Gore in which he discusses the scientific facts behind global warming, explains how it has already begun to affect our environment, talks about the disastrous consequences if the world's governments and citizens do not act, and shares what each individual can do to help protect the Earth for this and future generations. An Inconvenient Truth was directed by Davis Guggenheim, a veteran documentary filmmaker who also has an extensive background in episodic television.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JPXA", "B0013D8LHM", "B0027BOL4G", "0670062723", "B004IN75D0", "B0042EJD8A", "B00018U8YE", "B000YKI4MM", "B00147F8WS", "B0012Q3T72", "B0002OXVBO", "B000UNYJXQ", "B003M987AG", "1594865671", "B000I5Y8FU", "B001C17EVE", "B00005JMXX", "B001MWGZ6S", "B002PLMJ74", "B00366E1AK", "B001EP8EOY", "B000BTH4K4", "B000RPCJSE", "B002RB56W2", "B001EUSYHQ", "B0019KAQB8", "B004SO26RE", "B000BI5KV0", "B005OCJJ9M", "B002RX8G5E", "B005YFGIZM", "B000PY52IG", "B0041KKYBA", "B00AZMFNX2", "B001KWB0L0", "B003FNQ0I0", "B0069UP2PI", "0812982894", "B003Q6D28W", "0674058178", "B000BJS4FS", "B003Q6D28C", "1405187360", "B005YFGIZ2", "B0019A35G6", "B000OUCEZU", "B005ZMBDJK", "1594867348", "B00FGVS0DM", "B000MQ4WX8", "B005TZFZK6", "0312428928", "B0053ZHZI2", "B0055V6EX6", "B008NNY98U", "0767805712", "B00APG8QQO", "1586481983", "B002KLALEC", "B00DPUB5LK", "B003GSLVX8", "B00AEFXPSK", "B001E0KSAM", "B008LW2520", "B0009GX1EM", "B000WLUXZE", "B003CAKXAC", "B000CPHAAG", "B00IWULQQ2", "1931930007", "B00EL6AAEU", "B00013F2S6", "B005LAIH4A", "B000B0WO4O", "B006ZAPSJW", "B000EOTEM2", "0521732557", "B0007DBJM8", "B0018PH3NI", "B00CMDPTA4", "B004JR3OKI", "B00744WZ8U", "B0025XUTKQ", "B001M0N8UQ", "B0040QYRS6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005JPXA", "B0027BOL4G", "0670062723", "B004SO26RE"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 50499}, "asin": "1415724784", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51p%2Btk39UpL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "An Inconvenient Truth"}

{"description": "It seemed like a pretty good career move, and for the most part it was.  Demi Moore will never top any rational list of great actresses, but as her career stalled in the mid-1990s she had enough internal fire and external physicality to be just right for her title role inG.I. Jane. Her character's name isn't Jane--it's Jordan O'Neil--but the fact that she lacks a penis makes her an immediate standout in her elite training squad of Navy SEALs. She's been recruited as the first female SEAL trainee through a series of backroom political maneuvers, and must prove her military staying power against formidable odds--not the least of which is the abuse of a tyrannical master chief (Viggo Mortensen) who puts her through hell to improve her chances of success. Within the limitations of a glossy star vehicle, director Ridley Scott manages to incorporate the women-in-military issue with considerable impact, and Moore--along with her conspicuous breast enhancements and that memorable head-shaving scene--jumps into the role with everything she's got. Not a great movie by any means, but definitely a rousing crowd pleaser, and it's worth watching just to hear Demi shout the words &quot;Suck my ----!!&quot; (rhymes with &quot;chick&quot;).--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0045HCIYA", "B000F6IODE", "B00005B6JZ", "6304696558", "B00005JA9F", "6304765258", "B000KF0GWW", "B00005Y1UX", "B00000G3PA", "B000N3SRO0", "6304711891", "0792159659", "B00AEBBA36", "B0000542CK", "0790730979", "B00AEFXT1S", "B00081U7HC", "B00003CXGV", "6304806434", "B00AEFXR1K", "B00003CXTG", "B0002WZTOI", "B000065U1N", "B00003CXFV", "B000095WW8", "B0045HCJFS", "B000JYW5BE", "B002AT8K9W", "B003ASLJOU", "B0006N2EZ0", "B00AEFY4CG", "0767810872", "B00004STDN", "B002O3Z4WK", "B001B3LIOC", "B000CEV3M8", "B00AEFXX9Q", "B000U1ZV8K", "B0007KIFGE", "B004GJYRK0", "B001680M26", "B00008EYA5", "6305236569", "B00AEBB86U", "B000KGGIZK", "B002O3Z50G", "079284646X", "0783225733", "1558908846", "6305128952", "B0009UZG3C", "B00AEFYUQQ", "0790736411", "B002NZK5VO", "B00003CXHJ", "B002NZK5UU", "0790732149", "6304711905", "6305428506", "B00004WG2F", "B00096S49Y", "B00001ZWUS", "B000FI8MPW", "B00AEFXYJA", "B002GHHHJC", "0767817745", "B0002V7OI8", "0780618548", "B00AEFY0F2", "B006TTC5HC", "B000QUCRB4", "B00005JK8K", "B000PMFS2I", "B000ENC5YW", "B00HEPE6MM", "0783225547", "B00004XPPG", "6305213283", "B00005JPD0", "B002VWNID6", "B00007E2F5", "0767811100", "B005LAIGYQ", "0767815122", "B000DZIGDU", "B000274T94", "0783240295", "B00AZNEW5G", "B00006HAWN", "B0045HCJ5S", "B000O599YO", "B0068FZ0O2", "0767821769", "B00AEFXZJE", "B00009WVSL", "B000P0J0CY", "B00AEFXYOA", "B000P0J0C4", "B004SIP7ZS", "B003ASLJIQ"], "bought_together": ["B0045HCIYA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005B6JZ", "B00003CXPP", "6304696558", "B00DV2MVWO"]}, "price": 4.98, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 7428}, "asin": "1558908315", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51WE3PRTH1L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "G.I.

{"description": "From a match made in heaven comes a movie spawned in hell! Young hotshot director Robert Rodriquez (El Mariachi,Desperado) teamed up withPulp Fictionauteur Quentin Tarantino (offering his services as writer and co-star) to make this outrageous, no-holds-barred hybrid of high-octane crime and gruesome horror. QT plays Richard Gecko, a borderline psychopath who breaks his career-criminal brother, Seth (George Clooney), out of prison, after which they rob a bank and leave a trail of dead and wounded in their bloody wake. Then they hijack a mobile home driven by a former Baptist minister (Harvey Keitel) who quit the church after his wife's death and hit the road with his two children (played by Juliette Lewis and Ernest Liu). Heading to Mexico with their hostages, the infamous Gecko brothers arrive at the Titty Twister bar to rendezvous for a money drop, but they don't realize that they've just entered the nocturnal lair of a bloodthirsty gang of vampires! With not-so-subtle aplomb, Rodriguez and Tarantino shift into high gear with a nonstop parade of gore, gunfire, and pointy-fanged mayhem featuring Salma Hayek as a snake-charming dancer whose bite is much worse than her bark. If you're a fan of Tarantino's lyrical dialogue and pop-cultural wit, you'll have fun with the road-movie half of this supernatural horror-comedy, but if your taste runs more to exploding heads and eyeballs, sloppy entrails and morphing monsters, the second half provides a connoisseur's feast of gross-out excess.Bon app&eacute;tit!--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002AF4Y9G", "B000UAE7O0", "B000R7HY0K", "B004U7MR14", "B000P0J0D8", "6305327041", "B0000A2ZU1", "B004SIP9Z6", "B004SIP95G", "B002T9H2LA", "B00008975Z", "B007D5E7C2", "B002ZG98C8", "B0000WN140", "B007D0FVRM", "B005LAIIJY", "6305428468", "B00005JMUA", "B0045DO81U", "B00005JMEW", "630569270X", "B0009A40ES", "B001VLBDD0", "B0000A2ZTY", "B003Y8YB3C", "B0031P77RU", "B00027JZ3E", "B00070FX5U", "B000ASDFI6", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00004Y87O", "B000A2UBN4", "B000OVLBHG", "B00005O5AY", "B00011CZRE", "B000K7VHNW", "B000093FLA", "B0024FADD8", "6305258287", "B000WC3864", "B003HKN52U", "B001CDFY50", "B000AXWHSA", "B00111YM5Q", "B000EHRVP6", "B002VWNIDG", "B000P0J09M", "0767811054", "B004P7CN7W", "B00005QJHP", "B00AEFYYWQ", "0767802519", "B00GDDNFDW", "0783229526", "B008CYDD7I", "B008LC8V1Y", "B0007DFJ0G", "B001KRVLCI", "B00005JKWJ", "B000RTB0R6", "0783229402", "B00AEFYUQQ", "B00003CXWV", "B00005JLRE", "B002U4UZSQ", "B000LP6KNU", "B00AKGG828", "B002WY65VU", "B005J9ZFQG", "6305594333", "B0007KZQAM", "B000C20VRS", "B000056PMU", "6304765258", "B00005N5S5", "B00006CXGP", "B003PIUINS", "6305065551", "B00005JA8B", "B0002ABURA", "B00001QGUM", "B003AWRMCE", "0800177789", "B000022TSY", "B003TRMLQM", "B00008RH3J", "B00AEFXESQ", "B0002KVULG", "B002GSXKNI", "B002JT69IW", "B0085A9HU6", "0780618548", "B000055Y0Y", "B004P7CMOQ", "B006CXIKYC", "0792846435", "B00AEBBADG", "B00AEFY5B6", "0767817664", "B00005V9HH"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004P7CMOQ", "B000UAE7O0", "B004SIP95G", "B004SIP9Z6"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 216353}, "asin": "1558908455", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/517ESWW8VSL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "From Dusk Till Dawn"}

{"description": "Outside of devoted cult audiences, many Americans have yet to discover the extremely stylish, relentlessly terrifying Italian horror genre, or the films of its talented virtuoso, Dario Argento.Suspiria, part one of a still-uncompleted trilogy (the luminously emptyInfernowas the second), is considered his masterpiece by Argento devotees but also doubles as a perfect starting point for those unfamiliar with the director or his genre. The convoluted plot follows an American dancer (Jessica Harper) from her arrival at a European ballet school to her discovery that it's actually a witches coven; but, really, don't worry about that too much. Argento makes narrative subservient to technique, preferring instead to assault the senses and nervous system with mood, atmosphere, illusory gore, garish set production, a menacing camera, and perhaps the creepiest score ever created for a movie. It's essentially a series of effectively unsettling set pieces--a raging storm that Harper should have taken for an omen, and a blind man attacked by his own dog are just two examples--strung together on a skeleton structure. But once you've seen it, you'll never forget it.--Dave McCoy", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302921058", "6304819927", "6305807426", "0764005693", "6301103491", "6304361025", "6300218058", "6304147074"], "also_viewed": ["6305972060", "0764005707", "6305807426", "630428845X"]}, "price": 19.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 424166}, "asin": "1572522232", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51W716FX0KL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Suspiria  [VHS]"}

{"description": "Clint Eastwood (making his very assured directorial debut) is a poetry-spouting stud-muffin DJ stalked by a maniacally amorous fan after a misguided one-night stand in this enjoyably schlocky, undeniably effective film about good intentions gone murderously wacky. Although many of thevery'70s trappings presented here may ultimately be too dated to be taken seriously (including a very self-indulgent jazz number and a hilariously gooey seduction number between Eastwood and Donna Mills), the core premise of infatuation taken out of bounds remains uncomfortably plausible--and was influential enough to be appropriated by one of the biggest hits of the '80s. (Here's a hint--it starred Michael Douglas, Glenn Close, and a very unfortunate bunny rabbit). A well-staged and occasionally very frightening thriller worth watching for Jessica Walter's peerlessly unhinged performance alone. Frequent Eastwood collaborator Don Siegel (director ofDirty Harry,Coogan's Bluff, andThe Beguiled, to name but a few) has a nice cameo as Murphy, the mustachioed, chess-playing bartender.--Andrew Wright", "related": {"also_bought": ["6304429711", "6300215644", "B000005PJ6", "6300247236", "0790751216", "B003ASLJO0", "6300182452", "6304259131", "B00407PNY2", "B0002IXSVI", "079284517X", "6301773586", "1558807780", "6300215741", "079212569X", "6304457391", "6300215962", "6300215717", "6302224306", "6301863194", "6303589073", "0790748169", "0784001294", "6302935148", "6301607929", "B00005A1VH", "6301797957", "6304457383", "630443796X", "6300215601", "630248443X", "6300216543", "0790731975", "6300182495", "6305076146", "6300216721", "6300268063", "6302841984", "6300181707", "6300215873", "6303082815", "B000006FNX", "079073172X", "6304119046", "6300182533", "6303020089"], "also_viewed": ["B001M9ELQ2", "B000005PJ6"]}, "price": 10.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 276056}, "asin": "6300181405", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ABNPHZEHL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Play Misty for Me [VHS]"}

{"description": "Francis Ford Coppola took some of the deep background from the life of Mafia chief Vito Corleone--the patriarch of Mario Puzo's bestselling novelThe Godfather--and built around it a stunning sequel to his Oscar-winning, 1972 hit film. Robert De Niro plays Vito as a young Sicilian immigrant in turn-of-the-century New York City's Little Italy. Coppola weaves in and out of the story of Vito's transformation into a powerful crime figure, contrasting that evolution against efforts by son Michael Corleone to spread the family's business into pre-Castro Cuba. As memorable as the first film is,The Godfather IIis an amazingly intricate, symmetrical tragedy that touches upon several chapters of 20th-century history and makes a strong case that our destinies are written long before we're born. This was De Niro's first introduction to a lot of filmgoers, and he makes an enormous impression. But even with him and a number of truly brilliant actors (including maestro Lee Strasberg), this is ultimately Pacino's film and a masterful performance.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000003KHS", "6302158176", "6300183211", "B0019L21H4", "6300214826", "6303686796", "6303168507", "0782008348", "6303471501", "0790705141", "0790733927", "6303402070", "B00003CXE6", "B000056BRF", "6300267997", "6300181340", "B0001VL30O", "6301977815", "6305363668", "0800132009", "6304508611", "B00005B238", "6300182878", "0792845684", "6302226899", "B00005Q4GZ", "0800100832", "6304429274", "B0000A36J1"], "bought_together": ["B000003KHS", "6302158176"], "also_viewed": ["B000NTPDSW", "B0019L770A", "B000003KHS", "6302158176", "6302610702", "6300183211", "0792174909", "B00EN09FKO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 228315}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.9, "brand": "Paramount", "asin": "630021639X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41807N7YNFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Godfather, Part II [VHS]"}
{"description": "Just the name \"Orient Express\" conjures images of a bygone era. Add an all-star cast (including Sean Connery, Ingrid Bergman, Jacqueline Bisset, and Lauren Bacall, to name a few) and Agatha Christie's delicious plot and how can you go wrong? Particularly if you add in Albert Finney as Christie's delightfully persnickety sleuth, Hercule Poirot. Someone has knocked off nasty Richard Widmark on this train trip and, to Poirot's puzzlement, everyone seems to have a motive--just the setup for a terrific whodunit. Though it seems like an ensemble film, director Sidney Lumet gives each of his stars their own solo and each makes the most of it. Bergman went so far as to win an Oscar for her role.

{"description": "In the tradition of such obsessively driven directors as Erich von Stroheim and Werner Herzog, Francis Ford Coppola approached the production ofApocalypse Nowas if it were his own epic mission into the heart of darkness. On location in the storm-ravaged Philippines, he quite literally went mad as the project threatened to devour him in a vortex of creative despair, but from this insanity came one of the greatest films ever made. It began as a John Milius screenplay, transposing Joseph Conrad's classic story \"Heart of Darkness\" into the horrors of the Vietnam War, following a battle-weary Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) on a secret upriver mission to find and execute the renegade Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), who has reverted to a state of murderous and mystical insanity. The journey is fraught with danger involving wartime action on epic and intimate scales. One measure of the film's awesome visceral impact is the number of sequences, images, and lines of dialogue that have literally burned themselves into our cinematic consciousness, from the Wagnerian strike of helicopter gunships on a Vietnamese village to the brutal murder of stowaways on a peasant sampan and the unflinching fearlessness of the surfing warrior Lieutenant Colonel Kilgore (Robert Duvall), who speaks lovingly of \"the smell of napalm in the morning.\" Like Herzog'sAguirre: The Wrath of God, this film is the product of genius cast into a pit of hell and emerging, phoenix-like, in triumph. Coppola's obsession (effectively detailed in the riveting documentaryHearts of Darkness, directed by Coppola's wife, Eleanor) informs every scene and every frame, and the result is a film for the ages.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301115430", "630018627X", "0790701251", "6300183211", "6303686796", "6305363668", "079284646X", "6304935811", "0784011923", "6303953425", "0792836510", "6302822688", "B000003KHS", "630021639X", "6304119046", "B00003CXE6", "6302610702", "0792158261", "B000K7VHQE", "6303036570", "6303020089", "6303651488", "0800125762", "B004LWZW9W", "B00000JGEI", "0790705141", "6302360978", "6302415853", "0783107986", "B00005ATQA", "630336568X", "0790731975", "6305095566", "6300216500", "6301662954", "6302921058", "6300246965", "6300182878", "0800100832", "B00005JKEC", "6304286961", "B000062XM6", "0784011575", "630197154X", "B00004TYS8", "B00004WIDB", "6304414099", "0800116917", "6302517036", "0800199421", "6304259131", "0783202253", "6303109950", "6303313345", "B00006C7G9", "0792837312", "6302482712", "6300213986", "6303421563", "6304039549", "B000065U6Q", "B0000A36J1", "6300182770", "B00004CNR5", "6304025831", "6303422020", "0790748169", "0800132009"], "bought_together": ["6301115430", "0790701251"], "also_viewed": ["6303953425", "6305363668", "6305750750", "B00000J2KZ", "6303506291", "6303314015"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 172447}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.75, "brand": "", "asin": "6300214826", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41EFVS37MRL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Apocalypse Now [VHS]"}

The town's eccentric inhabitants, eventful night sky, and stunning scenery soak into his psyche and combine to bring a very different Mac to the surface, a Mac who collects seashells, walks on the beach in his jeans instead of his suit, and throws his calendar watch, beeping \"meeting time in Houston,\" into the sea.Mac eventually vies to switch places with Gordon Urquhart--accountant, bartender, innkeeper, and community representative in the land deal. After an evening spent drinking 42-year-old scotch (\"old enough to be out on its own,\" Mac chirps, and then laughs smugly at his own joke) and negotiating the real estate deal, Mac tries to negotiate a deal for himself--to trade his high-rise Houston apartment, Porsche, and oil-company job for Urquhart's less traditional, but more fulfilling, life.The plot runs along almost as if behind the scenes, and the characters are intriguing, but the real appeal here is the incisive yet gentle humor. During a visit to a Knox Oil lab, Mac is shown into a room that contains a miniature of the town he has been sent to purchase. The head of the lab says, \"Welcome to our little world,\" and then gives Mac the plastic replica of the town as a souvenir. \"Dream large,\" he intones.

{"description": "\"I'm not a drinker--I'm a drunk.\" These words, and the serious message behind them, were still potent enough in 1945 to shock audiences flocking toThe Lost Weekend. The speaker is Don Birnam (Ray Milland), a handsome, talented, articulate alcoholic. The writing team of producer Charles Brackett and director Billy Wilder pull no punches in their depiction of Birnam's massive weekend bender, a tailspin that finds him reeling from his favorite watering hole to Bellevue Hospital. Location shooting in New York helps the street-level atmosphere, especially a sequence in which Birnam, a budding writer, tries to hock his typewriter for booze money. He desperately staggers past shuttered storefronts--it's Yom Kippur, and the pawnshops are closed. Milland, previously known as a lightweight leading man (he'd starred in Wilder's hilariousThe Major and the Minorthree years earlier), burrows convincingly under the skin of the character, whether waxing poetic about the escape of drinking or screaming his lungs out in the D.T.'s sequence. Wilder, having just made the ultra-noirDouble Indemnity, brought a new kind of frankness and darkness to Hollywood's treatment of a social problem. At first the film may have seemed too bold; Paramount Pictures nearly killed the release of the picture after it tested poorly with preview audiences. But once in release,The Lost Weekendbecame a substantial hit, and won four Oscars: for picture, director, screenplay, and actor.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302413435", "6300269310", "B0045HCJ08", "0783217390", "6302801133", "6302226899", "1558807780", "0792839846", "6302730023"], "bought_together": ["6300269310"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 318451}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.51, "brand": "", "asin": "6301005740", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51BYDFD7C2L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Lost Weekend [VHS]"}

{"description": "Starting aroundHalloween 4, that masked nut Michael Myers stopped chasing his sister (played by Jamie Lee Curtis in the first and second films, as well asHalloween H20) and went after his niece. Now he's chasing her around again in part 5, but it's a lot of other people who die in the process. Donald Pleasence continues his mad-doctor bit from the earlier movies, Danielle Harris is the unfortunate relation, and Donald L. Shanks plays the monster. The film is an improvement on parts 2 and 4 (part 3 having nothing to do with Michael Myers), but it still amounts to routine slaughter with none of John Carpenter's stylistic brilliance from the original movie.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["630130053X", "6304288433", "6304136242", "B00023NRSM", "6300214605", "630428845X", "6300214656", "6305171769", "6300214192", "6302814391", "6300214311", "6301094352", "6300218058", "B00008DDU9", "6300214087", "6302717450", "6303396585", "B00000JQTR", "6303566391", "B00008EYBD", "6303579388", "6301589025", "6304169558"], "bought_together": ["6304288433"], "also_viewed": ["630130053X", "B00023NRSM", "630428845X", "6304136242", "6304288433", "6305171769", "B00005LC4Q", "0780627032", "B000FA57UI", "B000RIWAVW", "6301589025", "6302720419", "B00008DDU9", "6300214087", "B0000VCZMU", "B00000JQTO", "B0000039A6", "6302975832"]}, "price": 14.95, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 66825}, "asin": "6301562925", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/413P9DA22VL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Halloween 5 [VHS]"}

{"description": "A King in New York, Charlie Chaplin's penultimate film--featuring his final starring performance--was made in 1957 but wasn't officially released in America until the '70s, when it, surprisingly enough, won an Oscar for Chaplin's score. What took so long? Thanks to his politics and unorthodox personal life, Chaplin was pretty roundly hated by the late '50s, but had the movie been better, someone might've brought it stateside sooner. Chaplin plays King Shahdov of Estrovia, on the lam when revolution grips his homeland. In New York, despite the occasional indignity, he's treated as royalty until he takes a stand against the commie-hunters, a plotline that hit way too close to home at the time (Chaplin, remember, was ahead of everyone in attacking Hitler when he madeThe Great Dictator). There's one inspired bit, as Shahdov orders dinner over the din of a supper club, but overall, the satire is strident, and Chaplin's takes on such things as technology and pop music make him look decidedly like an old fogy.--David Kronke", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B000UO4F7U"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 313809}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.98, "brand": "", "asin": "6301798457", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/519YWT73R7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "A King in New York [VHS]"}

{"description": "Ernst Lubitsch's last musical teamed him with his two favorite performers, Maurice Chevalier and Jeanette MacDonald. It proved to be his last picture with either of the stars. Working with screenwriter Samson Raphaelson, he transformed the operetta that Erich von Stroheim had made in 1925 as a lavish silent melodrama into a frothy farce with wit, understatement, and a modicum of sexual innuendo. Chevalier stars as Danilo, the playboy captain of the guards sent to Paris to woo back the wealthy widow Sonia (MacDonald), whose purse strings control the kingdom's economy and could ruin it if she marries one of her doting French suitors. A merry game of mistaken identities, sparring romantics, and the teasing of would-be lovers lands Danilo in jail for treason and with true love his only hope. Chevalier plays his role with good cheer, gusto, and an ear-to-ear grin that wins over every lady on the screen, and MacDonald is at her sassy, sexy best, before her all-American image took hold in the Nelson Eddy musicals. From the opening shot, where a magnifying glass is brought to a map of Europe to pick out the tiny Kingdom of Marshovia, Lubitsch is in fine if somewhat restrained form, toning down his driest humor for the more stolid but luxurious MGM style. But he still sneaks in a couple of precode zingers: \"Have you ever had diplomatic relations with a woman?\" asks Ambassador Edward Everett Horton. Chevalier's sly smile is all the answer needed.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301971647", "B000ZM1MJG", "6301973356", "6301973089", "6301978315", "B0000UX4V2", "6301969243", "6301976142", "B0047BXR1C", "B004MTJHXG", "6303382932", "6302593301", "B00003OSTT", "630259331X", "6302077834", "6301965795", "6301965825", "6301978331", "6301978382", "6301969235", "630266232X", "6303231810", "6302010985", "6303017991", "B000H6SXLU", "6302041090", "6302888204", "6300183912", "B0000048YO", "630150528X", "6302888239", "0520222539", "078200847X", "6303560067", "0792837967", "1558807780", "6304039522"], "bought_together": ["6301973356", "6301971647"], "also_viewed": ["6301971647", "6301973089", "B004TPJN0K"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 289669}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 20.0, "brand": "", "asin": "6301973380", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/217QMAM53RL.jpg", "title": "Merry Widow [VHS]"}

He falls madly for a new girl in town (Kerri Green); since school is out for the summer, he becomes her only friend--until she meets his hunky pal (Charlie Sheen). Meanwhile, Lucas ignores the romantic yearnings of another female pal (Winona Ryder, in her screen debut). Written and directed by David Seltzer, this one is a charmer with substance, featuring strong, open performances by its young cast. It's also fascinating to watch today, more than a decade later, and consider what became of these performers: while Ryder grew to be one of Hollywood's brightest lights, Haim descended into substance abuse, as did Sheen, whose predilection for call girls also made him a talk-show punch line.--Marshall Fine", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 438197}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.06, "brand": "", "asin": "6302088593", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/7145F1CZM5L._SY300_.gif", "title": "Lucas [VHS]"}

{"description": "Xavier Koller's 1990 drama concerns a Turkish family optimistically leaving a threadbare existence in its native country and setting off on a harrowing journey for better luck in Switzerland. The film is relentless in every sense, in its blow-by-blow portrayal of the characters selling their possessions, traveling an illegal route used by other emigrants, falling in with a cluster of smugglers who do not have their best interests at heart, crossing the Alps on foot (an extended sequence that quickly earned the film its must-see reputation). After all that, they still have to confront Swiss authorities. Brutal and tough going, the heart of the film is not so much the accumulating despair and misery but the strengthening relationships of the central characters. Koller's film, based on a true story, becomes more than the sum of its episodic nightmares.

{"description": "Though it wasn't Hammer Studios' final film,Frankenstein and the Monster from Hellcan be considered its swan song, an intelligent, inventive, stylized reworking of the themes that had sustained the series for almost two decades. Dr.&nbsp;Frankenstein has buried his old identity and reigns over an insane asylum as Dr.&nbsp;Victor (Peter Cushing under a flamboyant blond wig in his sixth and final turn as the mad scientist) as if it were a live-parts yard for his continuing experiments. With the help of an ambitious acolyte he builds his latest creature, a hirsute apelike brute stitched together from the asylum's most promising inhabitants and turned into a sad, tortured slave. The film was shot at the end of Hammer's glory days, and the budgetary constraints can be seen in unconvincing miniatures and the rather bulky and stiff ogre suit, but the dark, claustrophobic sets create an effectively gloomy atmosphere. Director Terence Fisher effectively pulls out all stops for a marvelous sequence of the creature digging through the asylum graveyard in the middle of a flashing electrical storm, a demonic twist on the iconic gravedigging images that go all the way back to the 1931Frankenstein. This was the last reunion for Cushing and Fisher, who together gave birth to Hammer's gothic reign withThe Curse of FrankensteinandHorror of Dracula. Fisher retired after finishing the film.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302814669", "6303149189", "0792846761", "6302843227", "630252542X", "6300181820", "6300185443", "6302884713", "6300183084", "6302843219", "0792845552"], "bought_together": ["6302814669"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 356145}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 29.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6302491975", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Y0KF0QVDL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Frankenstein &amp; The Monster From Hell [VHS]"}

It is set in New York City during the infamous Northeast Blackout of 1965, in which 25 million people scattered throughout seven states lost electricity for several hours. \nThis was the penultimate film of Doris Day's long career, being released two months before her final screen appearance in 1968's With Six You Get Eggroll.\nNovember 9, 1965: Margaret Garrison (Doris Day) is a stage actress who has spent her career starring in virginal roles, although she would relish the opportunity to play someone less savory, such as an Italian prostitute, at least once before she retires. When a blackout shutters her current Broadway play for the night, she returns home unexpectedly and discovers her architect husband Peter (Patrick O'Neal) being overly attentive to attractive reporter Roberta Lane (Lola Albright). Infuriated, she heads to the couple's weekend house in Connecticut and takes a concoction to fall asleep.\nWhen corporate embezzler Waldo Zane (Robert Morse), fleeing New York with an attache case full of money, develops car trouble near Margaret's weekend house, he lets himself in and unwittingly takes some of the elixir himself, falling into a deep sleep beside her.\nPeter shows up, sees the two together and assumes his wife has been unfaithful. Despite their claims of innocence and ignorance, Peter believes neither of them and heads back to Manhattan.\nMargaret's agent Ladislaus Walichek (Terry-Thomas), anxious because she has announced her plan to retire, keeps her husband's jealousy burning in the hope their marriage will crumble and she'll be forced to continue working to support herself.\nMargaret and Peter eventually reconcile, but new questions about what really happened when the lights went out arise when she gives birth exactly nine months after that fateful night", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 168222}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "title": "Where Were You When Lights Went Out [VHS]", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000JJSJP0", "B004XWGYV0", "B000HRCN6K", "B0007TKHFW", "B000HREKP2", "1631739026", "B000MTEFUU", "B001O2UTRW", "B000MGBLF0", "B0007QS2ZW", "B0007TKGY4", "B00007GZR1", "B006H37P5C", "B005HOEBZO", "B000056BOR", "6300185974", "B000CCW2TS", "B000P2A22O", "B000JJSJPA", "B0007QS2ZC", "B000A59Q1E", "B0000TAZ3I", "B00005NWK6", "6302287448", "B000O76ZRG", "6304286805", "0978716736", "B000MGBLQO", "1593933495", "147815358X"], "also_viewed": ["B004XWGYV0", "B005HOEBZO", "B000HRCN6K", "B00007GZR1", "B00EL6ABL2", "B001O2UTRW", "B00IRQDQSW", "B006H37P5C", "B000MTEFUU", "B0007QS2ZW", "B000JJSJP0", "B000JJSJPK", "B001ANV2EY", "B000P2A22O", "B0007TKGY4", "B000056BOR", "B00CZ7AL32", "B001CDLATO", "B00508W3KW", "B00FFFUY8S", "B000HREKP2", "B000MGBLQO", "B000CCW2TS", "B001MBTSTA", "B001TKUXVQ", "B000MGBLF0", "B000UX6TG6", "B00CCF7VXA", "B00009IB1F", "B00070HK2Y", "B000JJSJPA", "B0007QS2ZC", "B00656C6KK", "B0007QS2YS", "B008D1Q1VU", "B0007TKHFW", "B00BQ412GU", "B000EBD9SA", "B00023P4RO", "B000MGBLFA", "B00IBKXPTE", "B0007QS2ZM", "B000MGBLPK", "B001D5C1EY", "B000MGBLQ4", "1905264305", "B00I4F0IY6", "B000A59Q1E", "B0001CNRB6", "B0095F0PP6"]}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21Q4S95Z5ZL.jpg", "asin": "6302641985"}

{"description": "Director Gillo Pontecorvo's 1966 movieThe Battle of Algiersconcerns the violent struggle in the late 1950s for Algerian independence from France, where the film was banned on its release for fear of creating civil disturbances. Certainly, the heady, insurrectionary mood of the film, enhanced by a relentlessly pulsating Ennio Morricone soundtrack, makes for an emotionally high temperature throughout. Decades later, the advent of the \"war against terror\" has only intensified the film's relevance.Shot in a gripping, quasi-documentary style,The Battle of Algiersuses a cast of untrained actors coupled with a stern voiceover. Initially, the film focuses on the conversion of young hoodlum Ali La Pointe (Brahim Haggiag) to F.L.N. (the Algerian Liberation Front). However, as a sequence of outrages and violent counter-terrorist measures ensue, it becomes clear that, as in Eisenstein'sOctober, it is the Revolution itself that is the true star of the film.Pontecorvo balances cinematic tension with grimly acute political insight. He also manages an evenhandedness in depicting the adversaries. He doesn't flinch from demonstrating the civilian consequences of the F.L.N.'s bombings, while Colonel Mathieu, the French office brought in to quell the nationalists, is played by Jean Martin as a determined, shrewd, and, in his own way, honorable man. However, the closing scenes of the movie--a welter of smoke, teeming street demonstrations, and the pealing white noise of ululations--leaves the viewer both intellectually and emotionally convinced of the rightfulness of the liberation struggle.

Producer-director Walter Hill (The Long Riders,Streets of Fire) sought to put this uniquely American mystery on film, but when he was unable to secure a script devoted directly to Johnson himself, Hill bravely decided to proceed with a more oblique, allegorical story that retold the Satanic bargain through a fictionalized drama set in the present day. In this 1986 feature, the hero is Eugene, a classically trained guitar virtuoso pulled toward the earthier powers of blues. When he stumbles across a lost blues legend, Willie Brown (a real blues figure and Johnson peer known for his partnerships with Charley Patton and Son House, among others), Eugene begins an odyssey back to the delta country and the crossroads of the title, where both Willie and Johnson had traded their souls for blues power, to help the surviving bluesman renegotiate terms.An opening sequence, shot in sepia-toned black and white, dramatizes Johnson's own supernatural encounter, as well as one of the bluesman's historic Texas recording sessions, and Hill's visuals combine with frequent collaborator Ry Cooder's reliably authentic slide guitar to offer a promising glimpse of cinematic conjury. Even the satanic villain--a grinning huckster named Scratch--honors the trickster figure familiar to African American superstitions, rather than a generic devil. Willie Brown (Joe Seneca) is likewise a convincing link to the blues past, but Hill's central casting choice--Ralph (The Karate Kid) Macchio--sacrifices all for marquee value, a Hobson's choice that casts a shadow of unintended parody across the film. Macchio's earlier character, not Scratch, haunts this film, and even a nifty duel between Eugene, his slashing fretwork supplied off-camera by Cooder, and Scratch's ax-wielding henchman, heavy metal virtuoso, and one-time Frank Zappa prot&eacute;g&eacute; Steve Vai, can't safely rescue the film.--Sam Sutherland", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 358168}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.9, "brand": "", "asin": "630280082X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/519BJNV0BHL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Crossroads [VHS]"}

{"description": "Alec Guinness, best known for the serious dramatic roles and authoritative presence of his later films, made his mark early as a versatile character actor and a gifted comic performer. These talents are shown to their best in this bewitchingly black-hearted 1949 comedy of a poor cousin murdering his way up the inheritance ladder of a titled, old-money family. Guinness, in only his third film, becomes practically the entire family tree, starring in no less than eight hilarious roles. Handsome Dennis Price is the scheming relative, the progeny of an unfortunate marriage that turned his mother into a family pariah. Determined to earn the title he believes is rightfully his, he ingratiates himself back into the family and plots his ascension through a succession of Guinness-created social dinosaurs, joyfully killing off his kin in a series of inventive assassinations. It's class warfare in action, and Price is winning the war. The delectable Joan Greenwood costars as the married object of Price's affections, whose own venomous nature becomes apparent when Price falls for Valerie Hobson, the cultured widow of one of his victims. Robert Hamer directs with a light touch and dry wit, marrying the understated Ealing Studios comic style with the dark, satirical edge of John Dighton's sharp screenplay.

{"description": "Richard Donner's 1978 epic about the Man of Steel showed how a film about a superhero could be a moving and romantic experience even for people who long ago gave up comic books. Beginning on the icy planet Krypton, the story follows the baby Kal-El, whose rocket ship lands in Smallville, Kansas. He is found there by a childless couple and raised as the shy Clark Kent (the young Kent is played by Jeff East). The film is perhaps most touching in these sequences, with expanses of wheat fields blowing in the wind and with a young man who can't figure out what part in destiny his great powers are meant to play. The second half, with Reeve taking over as Clark/Superman, is bustling, enchanting (the scene in which Superman flies girlfriend Lois Lane--played by Margot Kidder--through the night sky is great date material), and funny, thanks largely to Gene Hackman's sardonic portrayal of nemesis Lex Luthor.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300268993", "B000059XYC", "6300270122", "6303020089", "B000059XXZ", "0784011923", "B0002XNSYA", "B00005A1VG", "6303506291", "6301969413", "0800198395", "6302941318", "6304509154", "630196649X", "6304508611", "0790731975", "0790700506", "6300181537", "B000059XY5", "0790733897", "B00000JGEI", "6300214311", "6304047843", "6302238331", "6300214060", "630407185X", "6303148352", "6303212379", "6302510023", "0783216084", "B00004TYS8", "6302380294", "0790744589", "0792133153", "6302091632", "6302098424", "6304143184", "B0000068SI", "B00004RNAC", "6302510031", "630251018X", "6302510015", "B0000CDL3W", "6302510198", "B0001VL30O", "B000006FNX", "6302909023", "B000065U6Q", "6302032377"], "bought_together": ["6300268993", "B000059XYC"], "also_viewed": ["B000IJ79WU", "6300268993", "B000059Z8K", "B000P6XQ50", "B0039208JE", "6300270122", "B000IJ79VQ", "B000059XYC", "B000IJ79X4", "B001DJLD2G", "B000059XXZ", "B00F4FFO8E", "B00005JKCH", "6302642248", "6303953425", "B00005LIRF", "B00EAPMGIU", "B000IJ79XE", "B00BBND56G", "0790734079", "0784011923", "B000VI70QS", "B00005LKLF", "B000059Z8L", "B000UR9T8C", "B00005JXY3", "B0039208QM", "6303506291", "B0016MOWOQ", "B0087F7VSY", "B00000GUNY", "0783222726", "B00DYEN6XC", "B00E5I2MCM", "B0090SI582", "B00JPS6A3O", "B0057R5XRG", "B008JFUO72", "B008JFUS0U"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 202304}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.75, "brand": "", "asin": "6303212263", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51E39PXF9BL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Superman the Movie [VHS]"}

Writer-director Robert Boris presents the boys as heroes of the defeated South,  gentleman robbers avenging the pillage of their people by the ruthless railroad  and bank concerns pouring in from the North and pursued by a maniacally  driven Pinkerton on a personal quest for revenge. In the wake of Clint  Eastwood'sUnforgiven,Frank and Jessecomes off as old-fashioned  and a little naive, but the measured pace and casting of country singer Randy Travis (who narrates  and plays Cole Younger with a voice like molasses) gives the film, in  moments, the intimacy of a ballad.--Sean Axmaker", "price": 2.95, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 883528}, "asin": "6303591922", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/513XYWMY2VL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Frank &amp; Jesse [VHS]"}

Meanwhile, at that very moment, taxi drivers in New York, Paris, Rome, and Helsinki are all having unique encounters with a variety of fares, breaking through that invisible social barrier between the front and back seats of their cars, often to absurd or touching effect. Among them are cabby Roberto Benigni's ranting confessions to a priest, Armin Mueller-Stahl's relinquishing of the wheel to a stunned Giancarlo Esposito, and Isaach De Bankol&eacute;'s relentless discussion of sight and sex with an angry, blind woman (Beatrice Dalle).

{"description": "There were only two ways for \"classicTrek\" cast members to appear in a movie with the cast ofStar Trek: The Next Generation: either Capt. Kirk and his contemporaries would have to be very, very old, or there would be some time travel involved in the plot. Since geriatric heroes aren't very exciting (despite a welcomed cameo appearance by the aged Dr. McCoy),Star Trek: Generationsunites Capt. Kirk (William Shatner) and Capt. Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) in a time-jumping race to stop a madman's quest for heavenly contentment. When a mysterious energy coil called the Nexus nearly destroys the newly christened U.S.S.Enterprise-B, the just-retired Capt. Kirk is lost and presumed dead. But he's actually been happily trapped in the timeless purgatory of the Nexus--an idyllic state of being described by the mystical Guinan (Whoopi Goldberg) as \"pure joy.\" Picard must convince Kirk to leave this artificial comfort zone and confront Dr. Soran (Malcolm McDowell), the madman who will threaten billions of lives to be reunited with the addictive pleasure of the Nexus. With subplots involving the android Data's unpredictable \"emotion chip\" and the spectacular crash-landing of the starshipEnterprise, this crossover movie not only satisfiedTrekfans, but it also gave them something they'd never had to confront before: the heroic and truly final death of a belovedStar Trekcharacter. Passing the torch to the Next Generation with dignity and entertaining adventure, the movie isn't going to please everyone with its somewhat hokey plot, but it still ranks as a worthy big-screen launch for Picard and his stalwart crew.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305587159", "6304415346", "B00008OSD3", "6303202004", "6300216802", "630273486X", "6301543408", "630021463X", "6300215830"], "bought_together": ["6305587159", "6304415346"], "also_viewed": ["6305587159", "6304415346", "B00008OSD3", "6300214400", "6301543408", "6300216802"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 333275}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 0.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6303909949", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516Y2CS1YML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Star Trek Generations [VHS]"}

{"description": "Political heavyweights decide that Jefferson Smith (James Stewart), an obscure scoutmaster in a small town, would be the perfect dupe to fill a vacant U.S. Senate chair. Surely this naive bumpkin can be easily controlled by the senior senator (Claude Rains) from his state, a respectable and corrupted career politician. Director Frank Capra fills the movie with Smith's wide-eyed wonder at the glories of Washington, all of which ring false for his cynical secretary (Jean Arthur), who doesn't believe for a minute this rube could be for real. But he is. Capra was repeating the formula of a previous film,Mr. Deeds Goes to Town, but this one is even sharper; Stewart and Arthur are brilliant, and the former cowboy star Harry Carey lends a warm presence to the role of the vice president. Bright, funny, and beautifully paced,Mr. Smith Goes to Washingtonis Capra's ode to the power of innocence--an idea so potent that present-day audiences may find themselves wishing for a new Mr. Smith in Congress. The 1939 Congress was none too thrilled about the film's depiction of their august body, denouncing it as a caricature; but even today, Capra's jibes about vested interests and political machines look as accurate as ever.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B006FE83UE", "B0000049FG", "B00AEBB89C", "B002VWNIAY", "B001D8W7EU", "0800113047", "6303215734", "B0045HCJQW", "B0000JBALO", "0783222955", "B00000F13T", "6300181472", "1558807780", "6300181111", "6305282927"], "bought_together": ["B006FE83UE"], "also_viewed": ["B006FE83UE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 430231}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.67, "brand": "", "asin": "6304481691", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51K2W1W387L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Mr Smith Goes to Washington [VHS]"}

The plot of this post-holocaust sci-fi nonsense is hardly worth  going into past that point, except to say that it's stupendously, staggeringly  awful filmmaking. It's even more incredible when you consider that the writers  and director undoubtedly believed that they were making a deep, serious, grave  statement about the horrors of nuclear war... and wound up with several reels of  celluloid flotsam. Any self-respecting fan of bad cinema who hasn't seen this  notorious wreck of a movie isn't worth his or her salt.

He's locked in the cage of his own misery until his rebellious younger brother (Sean Penn) presents him with a birthday invitation to play \"The Game\" (described as \"an experiential Book of the Month Club\")--a mysterious offering from a company called Consumer Recreation Services.

How do you play a game that hasn't any rules? That's what Douglas has to figure out, and he can't always rely on his intelligence to form logic out of what's happening to him. Seemingly cast as the fall guy in a conspiracy thriller, he encounters a waitress (Deborah Unger) who may or may not be trustworthy, and nothing can be taken at face value in a world turned upside down.

{"description": "During the 10 years betweenNight of the Living DeadandDawn of the Dead, director George Romero had a string of box-office flops--some of which were actually quite good. For example,there'sThe Crazies, in which a military plane carrying biological-warfare agents crashes near Evans City, Pennsylvania. The virus gets into the town's water supply and has two effects on the infected: death or irreversible insanity. The military moves in to contain the situation, but the local populace regards the army as a menacing force and things rapidly spin out of control. Soon the highly contagious virus infects the whole town and the soldiers as well, while a government scientist races to find an antidote.The Craziesfeatures some great set pieces as the virus spreads: a little old lady smiles sweetly and stabs a soldier to death with a knitting needle; a young woman placidly sweeps with a broom while soldiers and locals have a bloody firefight around her; a soldier swings his rifle wildly at his comrades until they shoot him.Made in the shadow of both Vietnam and Watergate,The Craziescontains plenty of allegory: an invasion by military force, government cover-up and duplicity, madness and eventually genocide (all set, of course, in Romero's beloved Pennsylvania). The President only appears on television, and then only the back of his head is shown as he speaks in detached, almost bored tones. LikeNight of the Living Dead, this film offers no hope, no comfort, and sure as hell no happy ending. Keep an eye out for Romero in a somewhat gassy role as Evans City's mayor.--Jerry Renshaw", "price": 7.89, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 622083}, "asin": "6304983786", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51NA3QCSZFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Crazies [VHS]"}
{"description": "It may not be a disaster movie, per se, but this terminally silly thriller is certainly disastrous, and would be pointless without the novelty of its setting in a flooding Midwestern town during a torrential rainfall. Physically impressive but idiotic in every other respect, the movie pits an armored truck courier (Christian Slater) against a smart leader of thieves (Morgan Freeman) and a corruptible town sheriff (Randy Quaid) who are vying for possession of $3 million in cash. A waterlogged game of cat and mouse, the plot is so contrived that even the most impressive action sequences--such as a jet-ski chase through flooded high-school corridors--are robbed of their already tenuous credibility. Before long you'll be yawning as incompetent accomplices are systematically dispatched by their own stupidity, in the kind of movie where the use of power boats inevitably leads to at least one death by outboard motor. What's impressive here is the physical production itself--the effect of flooding was created by building a huge replica of downtown Huntington, Indiana, in a huge, watertight aircraft hangar in Palmdale, California!--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300183211", "B00003CXE6", "6303486746", "6301888901", "6304078250", "6301643410", "6302945135"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 434625}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6305017271", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5186Z7DBGQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Hard Rain [VHS]"}
{"description": "Some pundits called it a flawed, exploitative action film that glamorized drug dealing and the luxury of a lucrative criminal lifestyle, spawning a trend of films that attracted youth gangs and provoked violence in theaters. Others hailed it as a breakthrough movie that depicted drug dealers as ruthless, corrupt, and evil, leading dead-end lives that no rational youth would want to emulate. However you interpret it,New Jack Cityis still one of the first and best films of the 1990s to crack open the underworld of cocaine and peer inside with its eyes wide open.  It's also the film that established Wesley Snipes as an actor to watch, with enough charisma to bring an insidious quality of seduction to his role as coke-lord Nino Brown, and enough intelligence to portray a character deluded by his own sense of indestructible power. Director Mario Van Peebles stretched his otherwise-limited talent to bring vivid authenticity and urgency to this crime story, and subplots involving a pair of tenacious cops (Ice-T, Judd Nelson) and a recovering coke addict (Chris Rock) provide additional dramatic tension. Although some critics may hesitate to admit it,New Jack Citydeserves mention in any serious discussion about African American filmmakers and influential films.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEFYE08", "1558908390", "B002CA68N4", "B00000JGHV", "B00007AJG1", "B004SIP93S", "B002CA68NO", "6305505780", "B0000YEE6M", "B00005JLG1", "0767811070", "B00BTYPWDQ", "B00AEFY6TW", "B0000JBUHI", "B00003CY51", "B000BOH8X2", "B000BITV9W", "B00003W8NT", "B000JRYOPG", "B00005U156", "0792838076", "B00066FAQW", "6305428409", "0780627822", "0767821955", "B0006H32DO", "0783230524", "B00007ELEO", "B00005JL72", "B000051YMS", "B002GSXKOM", "0783237367", "6304821832", "0783230389", "B000TLOMPE", "B00008977B", "B000060MWA", "B00005JD5J", "B00004Y2R1", "B000035P5I", "B0001FGBUW", "B0000TWMTS", "B00465I1CE", "B002CPMB9O", "B00005B8UA", "B00AEBB9AA", "B00005N89M", "B000A2XAQ4", "B0000714BU", "B00005JD5H", "B003NH6FY2", "B000C20VRS", "B000HDZKLO", "B0000AC8LH", "B001DJLD12", "B00005ASOO", "B00066FAVW", "0780627857", "B000P0J092", "0780631234", "630514415X", "B004P7CMZ0", "6305505802", "6305120013", "B002VWNIEA", "B0000696I2", "B000053VBC", "B003BV8I3Q", "B00E1HIXA2", "B0024EWP6W", "B0009S4IGA", "B0009K7RMA", "B00000JGHO", "B003VA3JZY", "B006VRRGQW", "B000FS9ULC", "B00003CXWV", "0767813901", "B000E40QC4", "B00008MTYF", "B00066FAC6", "B00004RJ71", "B002FOFX9M", "B00BTYRB2G", "B000JJSL1W", "0783240201", "B00007BK2Q", "155890834X", "B002VWNICM", "B001K98MGE", "B002CWKU36", "B000069DOB", "B000P0J0CE", "B00021R7E4", "B000JLTRH2", "B00AMSM9AO", "B0000714BS", "B001KKU9DM", "B00006HAYO", "B00DW5IL2E"], "bought_together": ["1558908390", "B00AEFYE08"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0000YEE6M", "6305505780", "1558908390", "B000BITV9W"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 170777}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 13.0, "brand": "Warner Brothers", "asin": "6305047480", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51H52SBMMYL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "New Jack City"}

They're all part of Mel Brooks's wild and wacky first film, THE PRODUCERS. In this hysterical farce, rapacious but lovable producer Max Bialystock (Zero Mostel) hasn't had a hit in years and resorts to fulfilling sexually crazed little old ladies' fantasies for extra cash. But when he meets his new meek, neurotic accountant, Leo Bloom (Gene Wilder), the two accidentally come up with a plot to oversell shares in a surefire flop musical and make off with the profits. The plan sends the new partners-in-crime on a search for the worst play ever: SPRINGTIME FOR HITLER, written by an ex-Nazi (Kenneth Mars) whose only friends are the filthy city pigeons he keeps on his roof. Inspired, manic performances by all involved, along with Brooks's lively direction--which affectionately alludes to such MGM Golden Age musicals as SINGIN' IN THE RAIN--make THE PRODUCERS both referential and highly original as it moves along swiftly to the ultimate musical climax.", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301797973", "630281622X", "6305576173", "6300247112"], "bought_together": ["6301797973"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 552537}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 15.0, "brand": "", "asin": "6305112878", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/215KFPD56ZL.jpg", "title": "Producers [VHS]"}
{"description": "If you were to argue that Mel Brooks'sYoung Frankensteinranks among the top-ten funniest movies of all time, nobody could reasonably dispute the claim. Spoofing classic horror in the way that Brooks's previous filmBlazing Saddlessent up classic Westerns, the movie is both a loving tribute and a raucous, irreverent parody of Universal's classic horror filmsFrankenstein(1931) andBride of Frankenstein(1935). Filming in glorious black and white, Brooks re-created theFrankensteinlaboratory using the same equipment from the originalFrankenstein(courtesy of designer Kenneth Strickfaden), and this loving attention to physical and stylistic detail creates a solid foundation for nonstop comedy. The story, of course, involves Frederick Frankenstein (Gene Wilder) and his effort to resume experiments in re-animation pioneered by his late father. (He's got some help, since dad left behind a book titledHow I Did It.) Assisting him is the hapless hunchback Igor (Marty Feldman) and the buxom but none-too-bright maiden Inga (Teri Garr), and when Frankenstein succeeds in creating his monster (Peter Boyle), the stage is set for an outrageous revision of the Frankenstein legend. With comedy highlights too numerous to mention, Brooks guides his brilliant cast (also including Cloris Leachman, Madeline Kahn, Kenneth Mars, and Gene Hackman in a classic cameo role) through scene after scene of inspired hilarity. Indeed,Young Frankensteinis a charmed film, nothing less than a comedy classic, representing the finest work from everyone involved. Not one joke has lost its payoff, and none of the countless gags have lost their zany appeal. From a career that includes some of the best comedies ever made, this is the film for which Mel Brooks will be most fondly remembered. Befitting a classic, the Special Edition DVD includes audio commentary by Mel Brooks, a \"making of\" documentary, interviews with the cast, hilarious bloopers and outtakes, and the original theatrical trailers.

{"description": "It seems almost inconceivable that a film as great asLost  Horizonwould be nearly lost to the ravages of age and studio neglect.  Fortunately,  Columbia has compensated for past misdeeds with this superlative DVD release, which restores Capra's classic to near-complete form and provides a thorough--and thoroughly fascinating--account of the film's production and eventual restoration. Of particular interest to film buffs will be the engaging photo essay and accompanying narration by film historian Kendall Miller, whose affectionate (and infectious) obsession withLost Horizonis expressed here for the benefit of posterity. Equally engrossing is the full-length restoration commentary by UCLA film preservation expert Robert Gitt, whose efforts to restore this film were nothing less than heroic. Unfortunately, Gitt is teamed in the commentary with retiredLos Angeles Timesfilm critic Charles Champlin, whose contribution is amiable but superfluous. That quibble aside, this edition ofLost Horizonis one of the most rewarding DVDs of any classic Hollywood film. Although several of Frank Capra's other films have achieved a higher profile,Lost Horizonjust gets better as the years go by, and with its wealth of supplemental features, this DVD is a definitive archival tribute.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B005KR6O1C", "B000GRUQL0", "8087888057", "B0006B2AA6", "B008D19ZPY", "B000KJU13C", "B0007PALVQ", "B00EOBB866", "B000083C8K", "B001GLX6US", "0895773619", "B0000714AT", "B000002ZBR", "B00049QQJQ", "B000BYA4HO", "B000083C6R", "B0043GAT5I", "B00KIZY3XW", "B001BSBBDK", "B000OHBCI8", "B00AATUZQA", "B00011D1OU", "B004P8R9OS", "B000ION7A8", "B00BGGITZU", "B00005JKFR", "B0049985XW", "B003NN9ZCK", "B001BSBBIA", "B0002B15RE", "B00006RCO3", "B0011WN03K", "B0006B2A7E", "B000FVQLLQ", "B000A9QK8M", "B0087ZG7OI", "B0039R18WU", "0783229488", "B000KX0IOU", "B000BITV92", "B00008LDNZ", "B000E6ESXK", "B00AEBB8VK", "B000CEV3L4", "B000F7CMQI", "B000085EFE", "B003MJZ07E", "B000HT3PGK", "B00KIZY0EE", "B00000CQJZ", "B001D8W7EU", "B006TTC5A4", "B0007TKNJ2", "B001GLX6UI", "8087830865", "B001GLX6TY", "B0035ECHIG", "B000FVQLKW", "B000BYA4II", "B001BSBBIK", "B000EU1Q1S", "B00005JMR7", "B000E1MXSW", "B000CNESN0", "B0007TKNH4", "B005E7SFAQ", "B00006RCO2", "B006FE83UE", "B00DZP1C9K", "B0000549B0", "B0033PSH7M", "B003YY2886", "B000244EYW", "B00A33J8U2", "B001SMC9L2", "B004DK9DQ0", "B000OFOJ30", "B00004RFHN", "B000A0GOF0", "B000KGGJ1I", "B0045HCJHG", "B0009S4IH4", "B00AEBB97S", "B0045HCJ9E", "B002GSXKQA", "B0045HCJQW", "B005OT7YX8", "B001GUYAZY", "B00AJCUL0I", "B000KJU13M", "B005ZVIN30", "B000NJXG68", "B00AEFXD1O", "B00000F17E", "B000069HYF", "B0002B15Y2", "B00008LDO1", "B000LC4ZD0", "B000B7MX6Q", "B0047BXR1C"], "bought_together": ["B005KR6O1C"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005KR6O1C", "B0006B2AA6", "B000GRUQL0", "8087888057"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 9024}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.05, "brand": "Unknown", "asin": "6305416222", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51esGDjolTL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Lost Horizon"}
{"description": "Wes Anderson's follow-up to the quirkyBottle Rocketis a wonderfully unorthodox coming-of-age story that ranks withHarold and MaudeandThe Graduatein the pantheon of timeless cult classics. Jason Schwartzman (son of Talia Shire and nephew of Francis Coppola) stars as Max Fischer, a 15-year-old attending the prestigious Rushmore Academy on scholarship, where he's failing all of his classes but is the superstar of the school's extracurricular activities (head of the drama club, the beekeeper club, the fencing club...). Possessing boundless confidence and chutzpah, as well as an aura of authority he seems to have been born with, Max finds two unlikely soulmates in his permutations at Rushmore: industrial magnate and Rushmore alumnus Herman Blume (Bill Murray) and first-grade teacher Rosemary Cross (Olivia Williams). His alliance with Blume and crush on Miss Cross, however, are thrown out of kilter by his expulsion from Rushmore, and a budding romance between the two adults that threatens Max's own designs on the lovely schoolteacher.Never stooping to sentimentality or schmaltz, Anderson and cowriter Owen Wilson have fashioned a wickedly intelligent and wildly funny tale of young adulthood that hits all the right notes in its mix of melancholy and optimism. As played by Schwartzman, Max is both immediately endearing and ferociously irritating: smarter than all the adults around him, with little sense of his shortcomings, he's an unstoppable dynamo who commands grudging respect despite his outlandish projects (including a school play about Vietnam). Murray, as the tycoon who determinedly wages war with Max for the affections of Miss Cross, is a revelation of middle-aged resignation. Disgusted with his family, his life, and himself, he's turned around by both Max's antagonism and Miss Cross's love. Williams is equally affecting as the teacher who still carries a torch for her dead husband, and the superb supporting cast also includes Seymour Cassel as Max's barber father, Brian Cox as the frustrated headmaster of Rushmore, and a hilarious Mason Gamble as Max's young charge. Put this one on your shelf of modern masterpieces.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["0767821408", "B0000640VJ", "B0007UC8Y4", "B0010X8NF0", "B007L6VR12", "B001QOGYBI", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B000CS464G", "B007L6VR6M", "081099741X", "B0006TPE4C", "B00005JMJ4", "B0035G5IOE", "B00005JLRE", "B00005JMJG", "B00JAQJNN0", "B00007AJF8", "B00003CWTI", "B00H9HZITU", "B00441GZ1E", "B00000G02H", "B0083V2W4U", "B000A7DVR2", "B005C7SXMS", "B0006H32EI", "B000K0YLZ0", "B002O3Z4Z2", "1623160510", "B000934FC2", "B001CW7ZT4", "B00GMV8L1Q", "B001AQO400", "B001P3SA8K", "0783228457", "B00AEFXQ9S", "0571200125", "B00000ING2", "6304907729", "B00003CXGA", "B0000VD04M", "B001EOQCL2", "B003UESJHO", "B000LP6KNU", "B000Y7U98C", "B001UV4XUG", "0792846109", "B0045HCIZY", "B002VWNIAY", "B00AEFXUXU", "B007D5E7C2", "B007N5YJMA", "B003KGBIS4", "B0045NXMJE", "B00008RH3J", "B00AEFYVUQ", "B006TTC5MM", "B001MM3AZM", "B004XVMCN0", "1558908382", "B00IGK6TLA", "B0041T52S6", "B00029RTAI", "0783229526", "B00IJXJAIS", "B00004RJ73", "B003CRM6PA", "B004U7MR14", "B00005ALS0", "B004FQX5B6", "B00005QAPH", "B003ELKNH2", "B000025RE7", "B00005JNC2", "B006TTC5A4", "B00006CXGZ", "6305327068", "B00005Q4CS", "B004SEUIXS", "0792838068", "B002LMV7RA", "B00003CWOL", "B007D0FVRM", "B00A81MV3U", "B00005ATQB", "B00005V9HH", "B000IU37SO", "0783225903", "B00006LPGP", "B000M341QY", "B004SIP8ES", "B000Z8GZYW", "B00005JLSK", "B000063JDE", "B0014D5RBE", "B0018BD9DA", "B00005JPAR", "B00AFEY354", "B00079Z9VO", "B002DU39GW", "B00005O06J"], "bought_together": ["B0007UC8Y4", "B0000640VJ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00JAQJMJ0", "B0007UC8Y4", "B007L6VR12", "B0010X8NF0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 2630}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 13.11, "brand": "DISNEY", "asin": "6305428239", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51149RFCCPL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Rushmore"}
{"description": "This amiably amorphous comedy-drama about a myriad of articulate and  witty people pondering the meaning of love was originally titledDancing About Architecture. As one of the lovelorn puts it, in trying to explain the elusive nature of desire, \"Talking about love is like dancing about architecture.\" However, with the way the characters in Willard Carroll's film talk, it sounds like they could dance a samba around Frank Lloyd Wright. This undiscovered gem doesn't have a particular destination in mind, as it weaves in and out of the stories of its high-profile ensemble, but it does offer some hilarious, sharp dialogue and quiet surprises. Carroll focuses his film on four couples, all in one way or another battling with the problems of relationships, ranging from long-marrieds (Gena Rowlands and Sean Connery) to Gen-X club-hoppers (Angelina Jolie and Ryan Phillippe). Ostensibly, part of the film is invested in the mystery of how all these characters are interrelated, but keen viewers will be able to discern the connections among everyone. It's the uniformly excellent performances, though, that makePlaying by Heartcompulsively watchable. Most striking, surprisingly enough, are Jolie and Phillippe, the youngest members of the cast who reveal heretofore hidden depths of talent. Jolie in particular increases her already-soaring stock as an actress. Equally impressive are Gillian Anderson and Jon Stewart, who transcend their yuppie personas in their awkward enactment of the timeless dating rituals. Other cast members, including Dennis Quaid, Anthony Edwards, Ellen Burstyn, Jay Mohr, and the always luminous Madeleine Stowe, are quite good, though saddled with story lines that are occasionally less than compelling. The only complaint you'll have is that once everyone's connections are revealed, you'll wish this cast had more of an opportunity to interact. The journey toward the film's bittersweet end, however, is marvelous in and of itself.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["6304259131"]}, "price": 5.0, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 62073}, "asin": "6305470464", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71NR0WM0VVL._SY300_.gif", "title": "Playing By Heart [VHS]"}
{"description": "Rising to the challenge of Dogma 95's self-imposed restrictions on aesthetic freedom, Thomas Vinterberg'sThe Celebrationis a remarkable  example of the way limits can give rise to creative opportunity. (Dogma 95 is a  Danish filmmakers collective that also includes Lars von Trier, director ofBreaking the Waves. The group crafted a manifesto in which its members  vow to eschew special lighting, optical effects, props, and the visible imprint  of a director's personality in order to attain higher truths yielded by  characters.)The Celebration, shot with a small video camera and  transferred to 35mm film, concerns a black-tie birthday gathering for a  family patriarch, Helge (Henning Moritzen), which erodes into a battle after long-suppressed secrets are revealed and the chance to settle old scores  presents itself. Among the grievances are an accusation of incest and the  responsibility for the death of a child--gruesome stuff, but Vinterberg  doesn't characterize the partying crowd's reaction in quite the way one might have expected. In fact, the whole ofThe Celebrationis about  unexpected perspectives and vantage points emerging from out of nowhere, largely  due to Vinterberg's free hand at editing the film in such a way as to yank  truth from every corner. This is a strong work that belies skepticism over  Dogma 95's bare-bones trendiness, and is perhaps a harbinger of great work to  come from Vinterberg.--Tom Keogh", "price": 13.48, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 384694}, "asin": "6305495777", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RZGN5J8ZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Celebration [VHS]"}
{"description": "Ever spend eight hours in a \"Productivity Bin\"? Ever had worries about layoffs? Ever had the urge to demolish a temperamental printer or fax machine? Ever had to endure a smarmy, condescending boss? ThenOffice Spaceshould hit pretty close to home for you. Peter (Ron Livingston) spends the day doing stupefyingly dull computer work in a cubicle. He goes home to an apartment sparsely furnished by IKEA and Target, then starts for a maddening commute to work again in the morning. His coworkers in the cube farm are an annoying lot, his boss is a snide, patronizing jerk, and his days are consumed with tedium. In desperation, he turns to career hypnotherapy, but when his hypno-induced relaxation takes hold, there's no shutting it off. Layoffs are in the air at his corporation, and with two coworkers (both of whom are slated for the chute) he devises a scheme to skim funds from company accounts. The scheme soon snowballs, however, throwing the three into a panic until the unexpected happens and saves the day. Director Mike Judge has come up with a spot-on look at work in corporate America circa 1999. With well-drawn characters and situations instantly familiar to the white-collar milieu, he captures the joylessness of many a cube denizen's work life to aT. Jennifer Aniston plays Peter's love interest, a waitress at Chotchkie's, a generic beer-and-burger joint &agrave; la Chili's, and Diedrich Bader (The Drew Carey Show) has a minor but hilarious turn as Peter's mustached, long-haired, drywall-installin' neighbor.--Jerry Renshaw", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00008X5J3", "6304994540"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 339504}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.97, "brand": "", "asin": "6305499365", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/718J2JXRD9L._SY300_.gif", "title": "Office Space [VHS]"}

[2002] / Region 2 PAL European Edition DVD / Actors: Daniel Bruhl, Katrin Sass, Chulpan Khamatova, Maria Simon / Directors: Wolfgang Becker / Language: German / Subtitles: English / Run Time: 116 minutes\nThe year is 1989 and East and West Germany are still divided. Alex (Daniel Bruhl) and his sister Ariane (Maria Simon) live in East Germany with their single mother, Christiane (Katrin Sass) who is a staunch Socialist. When Alex's mother witnesses his arrest on a protest march, she suffers a heart attack and falls into a coma for eight months, just enough time for the Berlin Wall to come tumbling down, along with all of East Germany's ideals. Eight months later, Christiane wakes up and things have changed. The doctors warn Alex that any shock could bring on a fatal heart attack. He then realizes he must convince his mother that her beloved Communism has not been overthrown but is in fact triumphing over Capitalism. Alex then sets out to recreate every detail of the old East inside the four walls of their tiny council flat ... what begins as a little white lie soon turns into a major deception with hilarious consequences!", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000021Y77", "B000OVLBGC", "B0012QE4PI", "6302020816", "B005HP2IYE", "B0030Y1282", "B002BWP4A6", "B00792DYYQ", "B000P46QTA", "B000H5V8H2", "B00005U8EN", "B000YKT4BW", "0767802470", "B0045ZAQSM", "B0009VND0E", "B0009RCPUC", "B001F0TM2Q", "B00ID8H8EW", "B002KECJZ8", "B00008978K", "B0070YPWAW", "B00103584Y", "B001DB6J82", "B0001US47U", "B0037A4ILC", "B000I6BJ56", "B000063UQS", "B002BWP3UC", "B000TGCR38", "B0036TGSJE", "B00007KQ9X", "B002IVDLGY", "B00EO2I6QK", "B00280QNK6", "B000AOEPKC", "B000TLONGW", "B00F6SHGF8", "B00005JLQW", "B000065V3C", "B00005YUO1", "B009XTF8NI", "B00BSTVGHS", "B001D1F8N4", "B00006JMQG", "B002RB56YU", "B00GS08X2S", "B00005JKH5", "B001MVYUPM", "B002AG2NTI", "B00AZMFKXK", "B0030Y11Q0", "048647626X", "B0006IIKRQ", "B000934FC2", "1492399493", "B0013D8LCW", "B00005QFE6", "B00005JNCZ", "B000AM6ODK", "B0007NBJHI", "B000K2UEDG", "B000GRU8TK", "B000093NQZ", "B002M2T1VI", "B0012S6396", "B004SUDQ72", "1497362431", "B001BHTN90", "6305972761", "0060786140", "1572226897", "B0040QYROA", "B0019UGYAU", "B00E1RTCE8", "B000GFLEEA", "B0001VO38S", "B00GN13CLE", "B000N3T0DW", "B0006SJ3IQ", "B000BP3ATW", "1494337614", "B0013HL6ES", "B003B3O5IG", "B004SIP8W0", "048642474X", "B000PGTNFM", "159869989X", "B00005JLSK", "B004ZG5EYC", "B00019G4TQ", "B0000DZTIN", "B00080Z53O", "B00006G8G3", "0395040892", "B000HC2PLS", "B00006JU6Y", "B00005O06L", "B004XVMCMG", "B00007J5VT", "1571134689"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000OVLBGC", "B000021Y77", "B000YKT4BW", "B0009RCPUC"]}, "price": 6.36, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 1009977}, "asin": "7040267373", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51uNDYn6ZYL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Good Bye Lenin!

{"description": "Hidden throughoutCach&#xE9;is the sense that you should be watching every moment in this film closely, just as the protagonists are themselves being watched by someone unknown. Georges and Anne Laurent&#x92;s (Daniel Auteuil and Juliette Binoche) enviable lives are terrorized by the sudden arrival on their doorstep of a videotaped recording of their Parisian townhouse. It&#x92;s nothing but a long, unedited shot of the fa&#xE7;ade of their house, but it&#x92;s disturbing nonetheless. Soon another arrives, this time of the farmhouse Georges grew up in, and then another of a car driving down a suburban street, and a walk down a hallway to a low-rent apartment. Again the videos are benign but unsettling. Then the mystery becomes more threatening when they receive gruesome postcards depicting child-like drawings of bloody, dead stick figures. Georges believes he knows who the culprit is, but for reasons all his own  refuses to let his wife in on the secret. Clearly more is hidden here than just the identity of their stalker. InCach&#xE9;, writer and director Michael Haneke skillfully, methodically pulls back multiple layers of deception, like new skin being pulled off an old wound. he masterfully fuses elements of his predecessors to create a film that is haunting and memorable. There is Bergman's fascination with the complexity of relationships, the suspense and lurking danger of Hitchcock, and the unique cinematic sensibility of Antonioni. In fact, the provocative final shot is practically a tribute toThe Passenger--a lot of people will want to rewatch it many times to see what they can find in it (if, after watching it, you are still unsatisfied with the resolution, then watch the interview with Haneke in the DVD's special features for his insights). It's a film of great effect and intrigue. There are no easy resolutions, and the answers given in this mystery will only lead to more questions.--Daniel Vancini", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002BWP4A6", "B00006LPER", "B000SIWHAK", "B00386OWUC", "B00187FPC2", "B00062134E", "B000068MAL", "6305228876", "B0002DB52M", "B00AIBZLHS", "B002BWP3UC", "B000OVLBGC", "B000B9EYFW", "B002AG2NTI", "B0057GYODG", "B00005N89H", "B0036TGSJE", "B000G0O5IM", "B000MTEFP0", "B00092ZLEY", "B0012QE4PI", "B0019UGYAU", "B00005N8A9", "B00023P4N8", "B0007Z0NYQ", "B0001EFUFK", "B000EHQU3A", "B002VKB0M4", "B00151QYE4", "B00005JKJA", "B000N4SHOO", "B00HVOFP6W", "B00AIBZLR8", "B005KQVE1S", "B00K0MM4AM", "B004WPYO7E", "B00HE011DE", "B006KH6CF4", "B000N3T0DW", "B00008976W", "B0007OCG5G", "B000059HA5", "B000083C5F", "B00GPPXNQ2", "B00018D40O", "B002VECLXC", "B00AX7PGQS", "B003VA3JTA", "B00005QAPJ", "B00005OSLQ", "B003Y5H4R0", "B00HT2RTU6", "6305744114", "B00005K9O8", "B00429MM1K", "B002P7UCJK", "080215056X", "B000E5LEV0", "B00009W0U4", "B000EHQU30", "B000BRBA8S", "B00JJ3EHCG", "B00IGK6TH4", "B00005JLQW", "B0007GAG42", "B00000K3TS", "B00K72HVBC", "B00005NFZC", "B000HIVIQU", "B000N6TX1I", "B000OCY7JE", "B007A9EGG8", "B001CIOCLC", "B00AEBB89W", "B000N2HBIO", "B00CQ8HCSM", "B000EQ5V2C", "B000E6EGT6", "B000934FC2", "B0087IT8FK", "B002BWP3UM", "B0006Z2NCM", "B00GRA7M2G", "B00ATK015K", "6305999872", "B001AZJKKK", "B000GBEWNY", "B000GBEWPC", "B00F6SHGF8", "B00008976Y", "B000FVQM2Y", "B00H4IR3JC", "B004ODLUIU", "B0006IUE9I", "B004YCKKH8", "B00455JE58", "B002ZG4Q66", "B0081HLM2E", "B00AEFXN9G", "B0024FAG2Q"], "bought_together": ["B002BWP4A6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002BWP4A6", "B00187FPC2", "B0036TGSJE", "B00006LPER"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 17815}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.28, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B00000F7E6", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41CS99VVAKL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Cache (Hidden)"}

{"description": "EDITOR'S NOTE: According to a Warner Home Video technician involved in  the production ofThe Stanley Kubrick Collection, Kubrick authorized all aspects of theCollection, from the use of Digital Component Video (or \"D-1\") masters originally approved in 1989, to the use of minimalist screen menus, chapter stops, and (in the case of2001: A Space OdysseyandThe Shiningon DVD) supplementary materials. Full-screen presentation ofThe ShiningandFull Metal Jacketwas also approved by Kubrick, who recomposed his original framing,  reportedly believing that those films looked best on video in the full-screen format. (In fact, the original theatrical aspect ratio ofThe Shiningwas 1.66:1, meaning that a relatively small portion of the image is lost.)

{"description": "As revisionist history, Michael Mann's intelligent docudramaThe Insideris a simmering brew of altered facts and dramatic license. In a broader perspective, however, the film (cowritten withForrest GumpOscar-winner Eric Roth) is effectively accurate as an engrossing study of ethics in the corruptible industries of tobacco and broadcast journalism. On one side, there is Jeffrey Wigand (Russell Crowe), the former tobacco scientist who violated contractual agreements to expose Brown & Williamson's inclusion of addictive ingredients in cigarettes, casting himself into a vortex of moral dilemma. On the other side is60&nbsp;Minutesproducer Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino), whose struggle to report Wigand's story puts him at odds with veteran correspondent Mike Wallace (Christopher Plummer) and senior executives at CBS News.As the urgency of the story increases, so does the film's palpable sense of paranoia, inviting favorable comparison toAll the President's Men. While Pacino downplays the theatrical excess that plagued him in previous roles, Crow is superb as a man who retains his tortured integrity at great personal cost.The Insideris two movies--a cover-up thriller and a drama about journalistic ethics--that combine to embrace the noble values personified by Wigand and Bergman. Even if the details aren't always precise (as Mike Wallace and others protested prior to the film's release), the film adheres to a higher truth that was so blatantly violated by tobacco executives seen in an oft-repeated video clip, lying under oath in the service of greed.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002DU39GW", "B00005BCKF", "0470499052", "0314277447", "B0002XNT12", "0314904573", "B0038Z5T4Q", "074945332X", "B00337KM2S", "B003L20IG0", "630542828X", "0205667503", "B001N44BVQ", "B000H0MKOC", "B000CNESTE", "B00121QGPY", "B00441GYPG", "B000FVQLQQ", "B00004YA78", "B0001HLVS2", "B00BTYOYG2", "B000CEXEWA", "B000P0J0AG", "B00005JKG9", "B00AEFXYJA", "B000085OXZ", "B00BB67UNW", "B0035JHYGQ", "B00003CXFV", "B00004Y7Y4", "B00005JLX2", "B00AEBB95K", "B000XR9L50", "B000LXHK2C", "B000CNESU8", "B00441GYOM", "B00003CWUX", "B00A2H9VKG", "B002VWNICC", "B001AS32QK", "B000059TFO", "0780622561", "B002CPMB9O", "B0000296JH", "007337959X", "B000ARTN3I", "B002O3Z4WU", "B004SIP6C2", "B0000AM6JI", "B000OYAT3U", "B005FITIGO", "B00005JKMQ", "B0034G4P7G", "0792838947", "B00008CMRK", "B00003CXP7", "B000CQLZ8S", "B00004Z1FL", "B0001907AI", "B004SUDQ1S", "B00CLH0848", "0767817710", "B00007G1YQ", "B00008R9KG", "B000C3L2IO", "B0031OCY2E", "B00127RAGC", "B003U0AHBO", "B00JBGSHSQ", "B004IFYMWK", "B00004XPPB", "B0009OUBC4", "B004U7MR1Y", "B00008BNTD", "B001EJW0SG", "0783226845", "B003LR5BD0", "6304696507", "B0001I56FA", "B00DDY45DI", "B00GUO2SKA", "B0000YEEGM", "B000HT38IK", "B00006RCNV", "B000UGBOT0", "B000A9QK5K", "B000A9QK6E", "B00IJS2OHM", "B006DHATE6", "B0002J4X2K", "B000MXPE7O", "B004SIP7TE", "6305428115", "B00BLF9FYA", "B00AEBB9EG", "B0036TGSR6", "0783229402", "B00005BCK9", "B00004RE27"], "bought_together": ["B002DU39GW", "B003L20IG0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002DU39GW", "B000Y11B8U", "B003L20IG0", "B00005JN2Z"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 17334}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.75, "brand": "Disney", "asin": "B00003CWRX", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Y28RGA5AL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Insider"}

Tolkien's classicThe Lord of the Rings,  but this robust adaptation maintains reverent allegiance to Tolkien's creation,  instantly qualifying as one of the greatest fantasy films ever made. At 178  minutes, it's long enough to establish the myriad inhabitants of Middle-earth,  the legendary Rings of Power, and the fellowship of hobbits, elves, dwarves, and  humans--led by the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and the brave hobbit Frodo  (Elijah Wood)--who must battle terrifying forces of evil on their perilous  journey to destroy the One Ring in the land of Mordor. Superbly paced, the film  is both epic and intimate, offering astonishing special effects and production  design while emphasizing the emotional intensity of Frodo's adventure.

{"description": "In its third foray into animated features, DreamWorks came up with something unfortunate: the routine animated picture. Plagued with production problems (it was originally conceived as a mold-breaking PG-13 adventure), the likable film is a Hope/Crosby-style road picture about two scalawags who stumble upon the Latin American paradise of El Dorado, the mythical city with riches of gold. Kenneth Branagh and Kevin Kline are quite fun as Miguel and Tuilo, two Spanish con artists who are shipwrecked in the New World with a scene-stealing horse. The pair follow a map to the secret city where their loyalty will be tested: do they return home rich men or continue to live in this paradise? Of course there are some obstacles: a high priest (Armand Assante) is locked in a power struggle with the benevolent chief (Edward James Olmos) and the perfunctory girlfriend (Rosie Perez) puts the two friends at odds. Like too many of the animated features of its time,The Road to El Doradoimpresses only on a visual level (it's drenched in gorgeous greens and golds). The story and Elton John's songs are quite forgettable; only Branagh and Kline's playful banter keeps the film alive. The PG rating is for some bare backsides and a suggestion of off-screen sex that should soar right over the little ones' heads. Slick and light, it's a fine 83-minute entertainment for ages 5 and up, including the nondiscriminating adult.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005RDVV", "B00004YNUH", "B00003CXQX", "0783236689", "6305229449", "B000035Z2S", "6300275310", "B0000C8ASG", "0788805843", "B00005JLR1", "155890641X", "0788802194", "6302642248", "B00005JL95", "6303534422", "0788805533", "6302526574", "B000028U3S", "B00003CXJ3", "6304401132", "B00016JF2W", "6304290888", "6303314015", "6303392350", "B00005JKDQ", "B0007A2GSM", "B0000AQZYM", "6305326940", "B000035Z46", "B00000ICHA", "B00000I7Q3", "6300274268", "B0006JMLT8", "6302787068", "6303122647", "6305940932", "6304873441", "B0000E32WB", "6303206204", "0788806270", "B0009ZHJ82", "B00006IUM9", "0788803743", "B000089G5P", "B00005T7H1", "B00029LO18", "B00000ICHI", "6305319138", "B000BAVLYI", "B0002YLCHE", "B00005JKX3", "6302320402", "6304978286", "0792839420", "6302481805", "B00003CXXI", "B000063V8N", "6304434340", "6303326781", "B00005LL26", "B0000524CZ", "6304155972", "B00003CXQ0", "0788811002", "6305177473", "B00004R99N", "B00006CXK5", "B00000JYLP", "B00001IVFU", "6303991408", "B00005JMQY", "B00008Y47S", "B00006G8LB", "B00003CXHR", "B00005JKYF", "B00000J2JA", "B00003CXQ6", "B00008G9B8", "6304089627", "0792839129", "6303486894", "0783230095", "B00000GUNY", "B00007AJLB", "B00005MEP8", "B00004WG2B", "B00003CXDU", "630018403X", "B00005JLET", "B0000CABL6", "B00005LKLF", "1560395737", "6305093016", "B00005QATG", "0790720434", "B00005LOUS", "0788812181", "6301017129", "B0006432SW"], "bought_together": ["B00005RDVV", "B00003CXQX"], "also_viewed": ["B00003CXJ3", "B00000I7Q3", "B0000C8ASG", "B0006JMLT8", "B00003CXQX", "B00000GUNY", "B00005JMQY", "6304089767", "0783230095", "B00006IUM9", "B00003CXDU", "B00003CXXI", "B000035Z2S", "B00005RDVV", "B00006CXK5", "0788805533", "B00004YNUH", "6304089201", "0788805843", "6305229449", "B00016JF2W", "6302320402", "B00000JGOQ", "B00005JKDQ", "0783236689", "B0044RFTCE", "6303314015", "B0030IIZ4M", "0788812807", "B0039N74CW", "B0000524CZ", "6305942285", "6304873441", "6303939015", "0788806270", "B00006G8LB", "B00005JLR1", "6303983812", "B00EZH0BXA", "B00004YNUM", "6302787068", "6302642248", "B000035Z46", "6304978286", "6305940932", "B00003CXHR", "B0007A2GSM", "0792839129", "B000028U3S", "B00005LL26", "B00003CX7L", "B00AFEX83C", "6303036813", "078881172X", "B00005JN4W", "6304400551", "B0000D14JV", "155890641X", "6301792734"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 120057}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.95, "brand": "", "asin": "B00003CXG6", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Y2FMMYXFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Road to El Dorado [VHS]"}
{"description": "Schizoid serial killer Carl Stargher (Vincent D'Onofrio) has  been captured at last, but a neurological seizure has rendered him  comatose, and FBI agent Peter Novak (Vince Vaughan) has no way to  determine the location of Stargher's latest and still-living victim. To  probe the secrets contained in Stargher's traumatized psyche, the FBI  recruits psychologist Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez), who has  mastered a new technology that allows her to enter the mind of another person. What she finds in Stargher's head is a  theater of the grotesque, which, as envisioned by first-time director  Tarsem Singh, is a smorgasbord of the surreal that borrows liberally  from the Brothers Quay, Czech animator Jan Svankmajer, Hieronymous  Bosch, Salvador Dali, and a surplus of other cannibalized sources.This provides one of the wildest, weirdest visual feasts ever committed  to film, andThe Cellearns a place among such movie mind-trips  as2001: A Space Odyssey,Altered States,What Dreams  May Come, andUn Chien Andalou. Is this a good thing? Sure,  if all you want is freakazoid eye-candy. If you're looking for emotional depth,  substantial plot, and artistic coherence,The Cellis sure to  disappoint. The pop-psychology pablum of Mark Protosevich's screenplay  would be laughable if it weren't given such somber significance, and  Singh's exploitative use of sadomasochistic imagery is repugnant (this  movie makesSevenlook tame), so you're better off marveling at  the nightmare visions that are realized with astonishing potency.The Cellis too shallow to stay in your head for long, but while  it's there, it's one hell of a show.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0026LYLTM", "B001BPJJ9G", "B003TRMLQM", "6305238065", "B00005UQ9W", "0767805763", "0783229402", "B000OYC7BW", "B008NNY8RM", "B000BMY2MO", "B0000CERP3", "B000O76ZQC", "B0045HCJSU", "B00006SFKM", "0767821629", "B000K4X5P8", "B00AEBBA2W", "B000VUFJ0K", "B00011CZRE", "B001MVYUR0", "B00009QUH4", "B000NQRR1Q", "B000TJ6PBK", "B00006HAWN", "B00009MGEM", "B00005R5GF", "B0018O4YT0", "B0001EFTTW", "B00441GYVK", "B00005NRO0", "B00000I1KK", "0783237413", "B00003CXKA", "B000063US5", "B00005ATQB", "B00441GYXI", "B002OVB9YE", "B00BTYNXJG", "B00000JSJC", "6305718954", "B0012680CQ", "B001JNNDJM", "B000GCFO0I", "B0037XPP8Y", "B00K57K2JM", "B004EPYZU8", "B00008EY9G", "B0000AC8LR", "B00AEFXW8I", "B00003CXXP", "B004SEUJOQ", "B001R3YRG2", "B00013RC7K", "B0000AVHCD", "6305313687", "B0016BO72O", "B00DW5IKYS", "B00005JOWW", "B00006FDCD", "B00003CXPS", "B007I1Q54O", "B00005JMWP", "B0009G3B0G", "B0006GAOMW", "B0007Y08QA", "B004P7CN7W", "B00005N5RM", "B00005JLWN", "B002VRNIZO", "B0001Z52RU", "B00005Q4CS", "B000069I1I", "B008HUSFXO", "B00AJXO56I", "B00BLN4UPG", "B0009X75J2", "B00006JDU8", "B003VA3JUO", "B00005JKLZ", "B000053UIF", "B00005V1WW", "0783229526", "B002KLQ2ZO", "0780622650", "B005FUTBWS", "B0006L0LOS", "0780627849", "0783240295", "B000LP6KNU", "B000U7169M", "B000RGN2JI", "B000GI3KGC", "B00003CY6P", "0767824954", "B0009A40ES", "B0002CX22E", "B0057ZAA6W", "B00005UQ9I", "B00003CWRF", "B00005N7Z1"], "bought_together": ["B0026LYLTM"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001BPJJ9G", "B003TRMLQM", "B005CFBYW6", "B000A343RI"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 25555}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 10.99, "brand": "New Line Studios", "asin": "B00003CXKM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51%2BF5HiVvcL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Cell (New Line Platinum Series)"}

{"description": "The Replacementsmanages to be both completely formulaic and yet immensely enjoyable. When a professional football players' strike happens, the owner of a fictitious team, the Washington Sentinels, commissions maverick coach Jimmy McGinty (Gene Hackman) to pull together a team. McGinty selects a collection of talented oddballs--a Welsh soccer player, a sumo wrestler, a couple of professional bodyguards--with athletic pasts, figuring that if it doesn't work out as a game, it might as well be a circus. To lead the team, he finds Shane Falco (Keanu Reeves), a once-promising player who had a disastrous championship game. Naturally, despite squabbling and bickering, a roguish camaraderie develops through a mixture of racial infighting, harassment from the striking professionals, and a big bar brawl--after which they're all thrown in jail and perform the most improbable impromptu dance number ever committed to film. The mixture of cheerfully clich&eacute; plot mechanics, an engaging collection of supporting actors (including Orlando Jones, Rhys Ifans fromNotting Hill, and Jon Favreau fromSwingers), and sheer ridiculousness somehow combines to makeThe Replacementscompletely entertaining. Reeves is somehow turning into a pleasant leading man; he even emotes convincingly in this movie. And let's face it, Gene Hackman is quite possibly the greatest actor alive, able to speak the trashiest dialogue with fierce conviction. Plus, just to prove that the tight pants and close huddles of football are heterosexual, there are many, many shots of cheerleaders going through stripper-inspired routines.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00E1HIXFW", "B002NZK5QO", "6305428492", "B000J3OTT6", "B000056VP4", "B00AEFYJI0", "B00AEFYKWU", "B000FOPPDI", "B000NTMA0Q", "B0006GANOQ", "B000F6ZIIS", "B00005JPBO", "B00AEBB9UU", "B00005JNEW", "B000A0GP0Y", "B00005JKE4", "B00E8G5HZ0", "B000KHYN9C", "0792843592", "B001SGEUYW", "B00004W221", "B00AEFXJY0", "B002GIBVWA", "B000FVR1T2", "B001Q8MMBK", "B002VECM6S", "0780627849", "B00BTYNXJG", "B0009MDPYM", "630529142X", "B00005QW6W", "B00003CXND", "B004OBQDHK", "B004KPLVX6", "B002K0WBXW", "B000HEWEE4", "B00014NEZI", "B00005M20J", "0800177258", "B001BP4K22", "0767802454", "6305428530", "B004GJYRF0", "B00005JL93", "B000053VAX", "B00000F4ZY", "B000CCBCAI", "B0000B1OFL", "B00026ZD04", "6304712499", "6305428077", "B00000G3PA", "B000GAKDAG", "0767817710", "B00DW5IL92", "B002U4UYYQ", "6304711891", "B000U1ZV8A", "B00008L3W3", "6305213283", "0783228465", "B003AWRMBA", "B00FEHCQEC", "B008R65XTC", "B004BFTFBU", "B0047685IC", "0767817729", "B000QUCRB4", "B0026BXHPG", "B00000JGPE", "6305428387", "B0007DAGZ4", "B004KPLVWM", "6305428115", "B00AEBB86A", "6304806434", "6305262128", "078324021X", "B0000524E5", "6305065551", "B0006GAI5U", "B0001US66Y", "0767821513", "B0009X76ZK", "B000EXZFCQ", "B002GOAH1A", "B00AEFYDM2", "B00007E2F5", "B000A343RI", "B00AEFYIH2", "6305133468", "B00AEBB86U", "0783225741", "B000069HQ2", "B00005A3KS", "B002AT8KD8", "B000YGGNMO", "B007STBUHI", "B000089778", "B000ELJAEM"], "bought_together": ["B00E1HIXFW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00B83N2NU", "B000MNOX94", "B00005JKE4", "0790749912"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 62076}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.99, "brand": "Team Marketing", "asin": "B00003CXLV", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/513B1VE3PSL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Replacements (Snap Case)"}

{"description": "Classic cartoon fans will delight in the bevy of classicTom and Jerryanimated shorts, each of which  ends in the proclamation \"Made in Hollywood, U.S.A.,\" and most of which are from the '40s. Fifteen episodes (totaling more  than an hour) are featured. Included are: \"The Cat Concerto,\" \"Johann Mouse,\" \"The Little Orphan,\" \"Yankee  Doodle Mouse,\" \"Salt Water Tabby,\" \"Tee for Two,\" \"Solid Serenade,\" \"Zoot Cat,\" \"Johann Mouse,\" \"Dr.&nbsp;Jekyll\" and  Mr.&nbsp;Mouse,\" \"Mouse in Manhattan,\" \"Kitty Foiled,\" \"The Little Orphan,\" and  \"Jerry's Diary.\" It might surprise  more mature viewers, with fond recollections of the adventures of the gray cat and the little mouse, how  relentlessly violent (albeit cartoon violence) the 'toons are. This video, a collection ofchase-centric  films, is notably chock full of head bangin', body bashing, poisoning, and all-around disorder.The absolute highlight are two shorts low on smashin' and high on entertainment: \"The Cat  Concerto\" and \"Mouse in Manhattan,\" the first with Tom as the focus and the second with Jerry.  They both involve forays into entertainment, a great soundtrack, and a fun story. The DVD edition adds  \"The Worry Song\" fromAnchors Aweigh, the classic showcase of the amazing (and oft-copied)  duet of animation and live action, as Jerry dances with the wonderful  Gene Kelly. Contrasted with the  PC content of today's 'toons,Tom and Jerryis a literal blast from the past--a must for collectors,  and for parents comfortable with explaining that Tom isn't really burned to ashes, and Jerry hasn't been  beheaded.--N.F.

{"description": "A novice teacher faces a class of rowdy, undisciplined working-class punks in this classic film that reflected some of the problems and fears of teens in the 60s. Sidney Poitier gives one of his finest performances as Mark Thackeray, an out-of-work engineer who turns to teaching in London's tough East End. The graduating class, led by Denham (Christian Roberts), Pamela (Judy Geeson) and Barbara (Lulu, who also sings the hit title song), sets out to destroy Thackeray as they did his predecessor by breaking his spirit. But Thackeray, no stranger to hostility, meets the challenge by treating the students as young adults who will soon enter a work force where they must stand or fall on their own. When offered an engineering job, Thackeray must decide if he wants to stay.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000TXP56C", "B0044WUZXW", "B000XJD34I", "B00003L9CK", "B000056HEH", "B00AATGDW0", "B00007G1ZL", "B0007TKNHE", "B000UPMZ0I", "B00005PJ6T", "B0046BHC28", "B0000V499C", "B0006Z2LLK", "B00008L3UQ", "0515105198", "B000053VBJ", "B00003L9CG", "B001K2KM82", "B000K2UGZM", "B006FE83UE", "B001QVE3HS", "B00079Z9VO", "B00AEFY17E", "6305428271", "B000CNE08S", "B00AEFYK5M", "B000089Y9L", "6305428352", "B00007CVRT", "B00007AJG2", "B0000714BT", "B00K6D1Q18", "B002CWKU36", "B000SQFBXW", "B00005MEOU", "B0000WN0NW", "B00GICP84W", "B0000TWMQ6", "6305144168", "B0087ZG7Q6", "B000EXDSCA", "B00AEFXD1O", "B004SUDQ2W", "B002VWNIBI", "B000ZM1MG4", "B000X73NBS", "B003LMPKSQ", "B0009I8QHC", "B003EJO8KC", "B0000JBALO", "B00G4Q3KOC", "B0043X1FL8", "B00005JO3W", "B00003Q433", "B000667HHW", "B00AEFXOKO", "B0001ADAVK", "B00AMEZDK6", "B000056HEB", "B000KG4BD6", "B000035P59", "B0001US78G", "B00F6SHECS", "B00441GYZG", "B00008NFR4", "B00004XPPC", "B003NF97NK", "B0002BO05S", "B000B5XOSY", "B00AEBB8OC", "B0010YSD7W", "B0000AMRUP", "B00125WAWS", "B002VWNICM", "B008NNSD78", "B00AEFYRP0", "B001LPWGGY", "B00AEFY4CG", "B00AKGG5WG", "B000W089XS", "B000KJTGHO", "B000062XG3", "B00441GZ1Y", "B00005A06N", "B00AEBBACM", "B0009WFF68", "B00EV4EUT8", "B00066FBQG", "B0045HCJ76", "B000JU8HBA", "B00003CX8N", "B000056BSJ", "B002HK9IDQ", "B000HEWEJO", "B004PQM800", "B004CQZFE4", "B004AOECXI", "B003GOP0D4", "B000B5XOYS", "B00062IYXM"], "bought_together": ["B000TXP56C", "B000XJD34I"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000TXP56C", "B00003L9CK", "B000XJD34I", "B002VWNIBI"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 3868}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 19.99, "brand": "MGM", "asin": "B00003L9C1", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5175DSNHTXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "To Sir, With Love"}

Still relevant after all these years.\"Twenty-Two\"\"Twenty-Two\" is one of the show's six episodes shot on videotape, but still achieves a rare degree of eeriness due to its strong concept and acting. Barbara Nichols stars as a stripper who's checked into a hospital with nervous exhaustion, where she begins having precognitive dreams about  deadly doings in the hospital's basement, an exotic nurse leading her there with the foreboding phrase, \"Room for one more, honey.\"\"I Dream of Genie\"\"I Dream of Genie\" shows the strain ofTZ's change from half-hour to  full-hour format. A nebbish accountant (Howard Morris) acquires a magical lamp whose genie grants him one wish. The only highlight of this not-too-funny humoresque is the genie, played by veteran character actor Jack Albertson in a brief cameo, smoking a fat cigar and cracking wise. All else is drawn-out Walter Mitty-style fantasy sequences of said nebbish imagining the results of his prospective wish. Oh, and that signpost up ahead? Boredom.--Jim Gay", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305944121", "B00004W1A8", "B00004Y7H7", "B000055ZCW", "B00004W1A7", "B00004Z4VN", "B00004Z4VO", "B000051S6M", "B000051S79", "B00005IA84", "B000055ZCV", "6305944105", "6305909520", "B000055ZCY", "B00004RFAY", "B00004L8IP", "B00004L8IQ", "B00004L8IK", "6305772525", "6305908419", "6305669392", "B000046S2D", "B00004L8IM", "B00004L8IO", "6305669414", "630587087X", "6305837058", "6305302316", "B00004S89H", "B00004L8IR", "6305837031", "B000046S2F", "6305760438", "6305701482", "B00004S89G", "6305772509", "6305870888", "6305760470", "B00004L8IN", "B00004L8IJ", "6305701466", "B00007ELE6", "B000046S2E"], "bought_together": ["6305944121", "B00004W1A8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000046S2F", "B00004RFAY", "B00004L8IP", "B000046S2E"]}, "price": 12.73, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 298653}, "asin": "B00004Y7H6", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51IodQZ3tvL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Twilight Zone - Vol. 34"}
{"description": "While more cautious fans may want to pick and choose among the previously released individual volumes ofMonty Pythonfor their collection, true Pythonites will want to own this definitive, 14-volume DVD-only boxed set that contains all 45 episodes (in chronological order) ofMonty Python's Flying Circus. This \"persistently silly\" collection encompasses three-and-a-half seasons of dead parrots, cross-dressing lumberjacks, loonies, upper class twits, and spam, spam, spam, spam, spam, spam, spam, baked beans, spam, spam, and spam. Click past the occasional clunker and go directly to such signature sketches as the Ministry of Silly Walks, the Spanish Inquisition, the Fish-Slapping Dance, the Dead Parrot Sketch, the Lumberjack Song, the Cheese Shop, the Argument Clinic, and Nudge, Nudge. Taken as a whole, one marvels at how Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Eric Idle, Terry Jones, Michael Palin, and Terry Gilliam thoroughly subverted television convention with \"something completely different,\" like sketches with no punch lines (\"Your average TV viewer isn't going to understand this\").A warning to the uninitiated: there is much \"material that some may find offensive, but which is really smashing.\" Violations of something called the \"Strange Sketch Act\" are the least of the troupe's offenses, as witness the Oscar Wilde Sketch, the Dirty Vicar Sketch, and the Most Awful Family in Britain Sketch, all of which achieve \"the really gross awfulness\" all Python fans are looking for.

{"description": "Popular horror director Yoshisaki Kawajiri (Ninja Scroll) served as head writer on this 1995 feature. Komada and Koshigaya are scientists--and Bio Hunters, agents who battle the Demon Virus that causes humans to mutate into weird monsters. Komada has contracted the virus, but something in his immune system enables him to control his transformations. When Komada rescues Sayaka Murakami, the granddaughter of a famed psychic, from a gang of thugs, he unwittingly pits the Bio Hunters against the powerful politician Seijuro Tabe. The partners discover that Tabe is actually the horrible monster that's been roaming Tokyo, killing young women and eating their livers. He's no longer human, but a corpse possessed by the devil. The final battle pits Komada in his monster form against the tentacles and fanged jaws of the possessed Tabe, although Koshigaya administers the coup de gr&acirc;ce. A well-directed, violent entertainment,Bio Huntersuffers from a disjointed story: the link between Tabe's possession and the Demon Virus is never established. The ending suggests that the film may have been intended as a pilot, as Koshigaya declares the Bio Hunters' dedication to the ongoing battle against the Virus.Bio Hunteris not for viewers with weak stomachs. Not rated; suitable only for ages 18 and up for nudity, sex, violence, cannibalism, grotesque imagery, and violence against women.--Charles Solomon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00004YZGB", "B00005V1XW", "B00005BCKE", "B005CVFZ16", "B0007939U2", "B000056MMA", "B000031EG6", "B0000APVFZ", "6304493681", "B009AVC922", "B00AIZ2LR2", "B00H9GIAQY", "B00005V4XG", "6305167257", "B00E00G9AQ", "1586640038", "B00000JL4L", "B001808CWE", "B00000JL42", "B000E5LF0K", "B00000JL4M", "6305262314", "B0007CNXYQ", "B00ENNBZ68", "B008YRL6WM", "B000OYCMNU", "B00006BSGS", "B004FHCHA0", "B00005KB6H", "B000UFAUUU", "B000FILUL0", "B0000B1OC6", "B00843TZEC", "B00HFC547A", "B00GRZPQR4", "B000NNUWYI", "B00005NG6U", "B00000IBUG", "B00014X8KO", "B00GS1GWRU", "B00000F0VU", "B00HFC30A8", "B00393UF6O", "B001AYWYEA", "B008NNY9YE", "B001N2WJ44", "B001CZJP0S", "B000Q66PX4", "B0009P42S2", "B00EV5I8JA", "B009AVCAJ4", "B003UNG8H8", "B000TZN7KQ", "B00BQ1DDUG", "B005WMQ5R8", "B0000WN0MS", "B007S9XXFA", "B0002J4X3Y", "B004SGWYVA", "B00E688U9K", "B00DNQM7M2", "B002CWKTQ4", "B008YRL7JE", "B004TP55PM", "B00005UW7E", "B00A92MDMM", "B001SGEUC4", "B004RIACSQ", "B00F9F4DX6", "B003UNASK6", "B00005QBZ9", "B00004Z4WG", "B001VFM5YW", "0767836316", "B009T3AHPC", "B009RZ890M", "B005SH647S", "B008HHTEUU", "B00000EZX5", "B00007M5JH", "B00CJ7XZFO", "B00DOZNGTK", "1573306886", "B00003UCAV", "B000087F31", "B007ILZAA4", "B00D44IQQE", "B004JPJHMY", "B000XSKDJW", "B005VAB7AQ", "B00B40N2UK", "B000063K2F", "B00441GYS8", "B0083QJVJO", "B00008K777", "B0001WTWMY", "B00012FWZ0", "B00B1RB8AC", "B0007R4TFI", "B002KX9CPO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B009AVC922", "B005CVFZ16", "B00ENNBZ68", "B0007939U2"]}, "price": 10.72, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 170416}, "asin": "B0000541S4", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514V9RPTK5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "BioHunter (Special Edition)"}

{"description": "This thoroughly second-rate follow-up to the groundbreaking (and highly profitable) horror flickThe Blair Witch Project--produced byBlair Witchdirectors Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez--plays with the notions of reality and fantasy that surrounded the hype of the original movie, and attempts to throw in some scares along the way. A year after the release of the original film, a group of five Blair Witch aficionados--four out-of-towners led by one seriously unhinged \"tour guide\"--venture into the woods outside Burkittsville, Maryland, on a tour of the sites made famous by missing documentarians Heather, Mike, and Josh. After a drunken night of camping out in hopes of communing with the spirit of the Blair Witch, the five wake up to find that their seemingly innocent sleep may have been disturbed somehow. But what exactly happened? If you're expecting suspense of the first degree and a horrifying payoff similar to the one that climaxed the first film, you'll be sorely disappointed. After retreating to an old, run-down broom factory (get it? Broom factory? Blair Witch? Oh well...), the five go over their videotapes of the night in question to get some answers, and basically wind up screaming at each other for the remainder of the film, and shedding some blood along the way. Documentary filmmaker Joe Berlinger (of the highly acclaimedParadise LostandBrother's Keeper) proves that he should definitely stick to nonfiction filmmaking, and the entire cast is grating and unpleasant, aside from a scene-stealing turn by Kim Director as a goth chick with attitude to burn and a no-nonsense approach to this Blair Witch stuff. Strictly for hard-coreBlair Witchfans only, and even then this sequel may prove to disappoint.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00001QGUM", "B00LLAV26O", "B00LMBUR6S", "B002AS45VK", "B00LBFFR2Y", "B0009X763M", "B003Y5H59M", "B00L6AW1K0", "B00AEFYYH6", "B00L9K2EGS", "B00KDU8HQQ", "B000I2J68M", "B00KTFJ5F2", "B00HRCATDW", "B003VE9WP6", "B000A6T1ZY", "B00L3OAS5Y", "B001NPD9LS", "B000099T3M", "B00IQHPS6A", "B001UGGVDI", "B00KUS5YGC", "B002LMSWN2", "B00AEFY31S", "B000MEYJHO", "B00IKM5LFY", "B0006SGYL0", "B00KTFJ50M", "B00006FDBT", "B003L20IEW", "B00006FI0R", "B000FS9FE4", "6305622760", "B000KJU1KK", "B0051GLDQS", "B0000CEB6Y", "B003VA3JUO", "B00HRCBGRA", "B0000AOX09", "B008874968", "B000BTIU4S", "B002VKE1K2", "B00AEFY37C", "B00L22H2IS", "B000BTJDGC", "B00BEIYMAG", "B00005N5RM", "B001B8XRT6", "B00004W4UD", "B002YI9304", "B009AMALGM", "B00GJ7CUFG", "B00AEFYV9W", "B004W48KHK", "B00GNAO70K", "B00000I1KK", "B00K2CHVSK", "B00J81S92S", "B0021L8UFI", "B001P3SA9Y", "B004P7CM9Q", "B00009MGEM", "B005CFBZQ6", "B0056P6SOG", "B00JF5GAIW", "B00EZ50SGW", "B00CERJI5U", "B003Q6D25K", "B00B96TGQS", "B000S0GYRU", "B00BM4Q4H6", "B00005LQ0Z", "B00005JOWW", "B009DA743Y", "B005B0QYMM", "B000A2X3U2", "B00003CWRF", "B000AM6OQ2", "B00AEFY2WI", "B0031U8OEK", "B001MVYUR0", "B000V4UFZK", "B0002C4JJ4", "B000GCFO0I", "B00HRUQ7WG", "B00IXD2MWK", "B0000VCZNE", "B009O07N9I", "B0002KQNL8", "B00AGKH4MG", "B001CT876C", "B001KKU9CI", "B00AEFY2LO", "B00I31COHA", "B000FSME9W", "B000WC3864", "B006P0FD4W", "B000A5045Q", "B008JFUNYG"], "bought_together": ["B00001QGUM", "B00AEFYYH6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00001QGUM", "B000FA57UI", "B00AEFYYH6", "B00BEIYMAG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 91036}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 0.99, "brand": "", "asin": "B000056T5E", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51674ASQWCL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Book of Shadows - Blair Witch 2 (DVD + CD)"}

{"description": "Criticizing Richard Strauss for composing melodically enduring operas is  as pointless as lambasting Vermeer for painting only exquisite interior scenes.  Those who say Strauss never improved onRosenkavaliermay be right, but  when such beguiling sounds kept coming from his music for the next 30 years of  his life, there shouldn't be any quibbles.Arabellafollows a woman who cannot make up her mind on a suitor and,  like most Strauss operas, ends with a meltingly lovely duet. Taped at the  Metropolitan Opera House in 1994 under the baton of conductor Christian  Thielemann, this production features Kiri Te Kanawa in the title role; her  acting is mediocre, but vocally she never forces anything and at least sounds  like the perfect Arabella. Wolfgang Brendel does well with Mandryka, who finally  ends up with Arabella, and Marie McLaughlin as Zdenka makes a sympathetic  younger sister to the heroine. Otto Schenk's production is sturdily  conservative, the video transfer is acceptable if unspectacular, and the sound  mix is CD-quality.--Kevin Filipski", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00009PY2C", "B00I3LDEFQ", "B00CU55HMY", "B000068UXJ", "B00H28A5EO", "B00IAV08DK", "B007CYKHIW", "B00HZ3L25M", "B00014NE4Y", "B000A3VTT8", "B000NVL49W", "B003UC49XO", "B00FABG42W", "B0020XT9RK", "B00579EKW8", "B007R5KKJW", "B00008DDRN", "B000068UXF", "B00J90AFJI", "B003ZWTGKU", "B00CIWPJ0Y", "B0006O9M6S", "B00006J9OV", "B0013V33DG", "B00I32AOBM", "B00008DDRJ", "B0002TTTK6", "B0007P0LNO", "B00HZX0INO", "B00005BI90", "B000TMCG9C", "B00FABG404", "B000BP86V4", "B00H540M9S", "B006IOOXNM", "B0043988GM", "B000050X2Z", "B000A0XS0Y", "B00DEYJSF2", "B00DEYJS7U", "B00DEROR32", "B000F3T3CS", "B000056JSS", "B0017HEY9I", "B0079IJ17E", "B002HWBS96", "B00INVOOSC", "B0012NO92O", "B000068UXH", "B000YCLRBA", "B000OONQ1W", "B000NIWI9K", "B00007CVRJ", "B008K7RGA2", "B004CPJC8U", "B00IEVFEOY", "B00IAC4TFM", "B0002UNQ5Y", "B000094HMU", "B004ECFW7Q", "B000PC1N40", "B0009W4LLS", "B00008DDRL", "B003Y58CKI", "B000BO0GPY", "B000787WZQ", "B003Y58CLC", "B0012GLMMQ", "B008HC9982", "B0000C7PQP", "B00GCVWV12", "B00006L9ZT", "B001BWQVW2", "B00CSI6JP2", "B0007OC7EQ", "B00GNNES60", "B00361DR4Q", "B00I32AMPU", "B000Y9M09G", "B0009I8PHI", "B00027LD5W", "B0001BPPO4", "B000VLYIW4", "B008ROGZUK", "B003ELZL0Q", "B000ASAEQW", "B00005A1SZ", "B0039I1HN4", "B0093OFLNU", "B002LL13BQ", "B00005NGA8", "B00GMV8L1Q", "B008XNPNO4", "B004QQDUZ6", "B00006J9OU", "B000I8OFKA", "B005IIA996", "B000T0XEGS", "B002YH6FME", "B00BT70J7M"], "bought_together": ["B000068UXJ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0011WMWX4", "B0012L0TG6", "B006IOOXNM", "B0000DI86P"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 168561}, "categories": [["CDs & Vinyl", "Classical"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Opera & Classical Vocal"], ["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 17.46, "brand": "", "asin": "B00005A78O", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41hUlAE49qL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Richard Strauss - Arabella / Thielemann, Te Kanawa, Brendel, Metropolitan Opera"}
{"description": "Antoine Fuqua (THE REPLACEMENT KILLERS, BAIT) turns up the intensity level with TRAINING DAY, a charged drama about police corruption in downtown Los Angeles. Ethan Hawke stars as Jake Hoyt, a well-intentioned young officer who thinks he's found his ticket to becoming a detective in the form of undercover officer Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington). Harris is a notorious figure in the streets and in the office. He also has the authority to make Jake's professional wishes come true, provided Jake is able to prove his worth on Alonzo's team. At first, Alonzo's blunt, carefree demeanor provides a shock to Jake's optimistic system, but as it becomes clear that Alonzo is dangerously out of control, Jake must decide whether or not to risk his future in the name of the law.\n\nWashington's performance as the evil, pragmatic detective is a sight to behold. He delivers his lines with a devilish ferocity that keeps the film bubbling throughout. Hawke slips into the role of the rookie everyman with ease, providing a good contrast to Washington's fiery presence. Former video director Fuqua completes the picture by casting musicians Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre, and Macy Gray in supporting roles.", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792841778", "630268644X", "6303012140", "6300214826"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 428216}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.0, "brand": "", "asin": "B00005JKEC", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/415AYTB1GNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Training Day [VHS]"}
{"description": "Gosford Parkfinds director Robert Altman in sumptuously fine form indeed. From the opening shots, as the camera peers through the trees at an opulent English country estate, Altman exploits the 1930s period setting and whodunit formula of the film expertly. Aristocrats gather together for a weekend shooting party with their dutiful servants in tow, and the upstairs/downstairs division of the classes is perfectly tailored to Altman's method (as employed inNashvilleandShort Cuts) of overlapping bits of dialogue and numerous subplots in order to betray underlying motives and the sins that propel them. Greed, vengeance, snobbery, and lust stir comic unrest as the near dizzying effect of brisk script turns is allayed by perhaps Altman's strongest ensemble to date. First and foremost, Maggie Smith is marvelous as Constance, a dependent countess with a quip for every occasion; Michael Gambon, as the ill-fated host, Sir William McCordle, is one of the most palpably salacious characters ever on screen; Kristin Scott Thomas is perfectly cold yet sexy as Lady Sylvia, Sir William's wife; and Helen Mirren, Emily Watson, and Clive Owen are equally memorable as key characters from the bustling servants' quarters below.Gosford Parkmanages to be fabulously entertaining while exposing human shortcomings, compromises, and our endless need for confession.--Fionn Meade", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000BITVAG", "B007A2O3FO", "B00003CXC9", "B005S9EJ14", "B0000CE684", "B00AZMFO6I", "B0080QOL10", "630560097X", "B000LPS34E", "B000E8JNQU", "B004ALIG2O", "B00005UNCB", "B004JMSIQS", "6305692696", "B00F1BFRA6", "B002TZS58I", "B0002DRDY6", "B004SIP7D0", "B000E0ODZE", "B0001US78G", "B004XVMCMQ", "B004XYOQU4", "1557045313", "B005SYZYYK", "B000F3UAFC", "B000063K2Q", "B00003CX8N", "B0009GX1CE", "B001KP2J3U", "B0006Z2NAY", "B008NNY8TK", "B00062IZ0Y", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B005CFBZX4", "B004U7MQZ6", "B0001I55M4", "B00005O7N8", "0788815490", "B00GSBMNOQ", "B003UESJH4", "B0001DCYUU", "B0000797E7", "B008RO6PJQ", "B0013K2ZGI", "B000ETRCN0", "B00005OBAL", "B0009PVZM8", "6305918880", "B0080QOKYS", "B00HUAH14Q", "B00009IB1D", "B000A8AXXG", "B00GWXI16O", "B00C888OFA", "B00GAXASLC", "1250020360", "B000N4SHOE", "B004H0ZHD4", "B0099Y2MYK", "B009B1EPQ4", "B001CW7ZT4", "1573629723", "B009T6CXG0", "B001GJ4U5A", "B004SIP98S", "B00G15MDI0", "B00B62R9XM", "B004SIP9U6", "B0080QOL1A", "B000069HZU", "B004N66XYE", "B004XVMCKS", "1250047900", "B004499LWG", "B00AY2DL78", "6305428557", "B00A1EOC22", "B00D49YEHO", "B00BTYJYR6", "B0001US61O", "B0006Q9482", "B007701RFS", "B0073U2EWM", "B00F98FOI6", "B000092T3P", "B000CCW2O8", "B000065V3V", "B004HHX9H8", "B00HYZ0ZLS", "B00JFH8GZA", "B003DUBAXK", "B00AEFYO5I", "B00005U2KC", "B004SIP7F8", "B00GAHJO8G", "B00005RDRO", "B00DW5IKWK", "B00D3PYQT0", "B00005JOA0"], "bought_together": ["B000BITVAG", "B005S9EJ14"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AZMFO6I", "B000BITVAG", "630560097X", "B00005UNCB"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 7477}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 10.27, "brand": "Universal Studios", "asin": "B00005JKNF", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51oleUlbquL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Gosford Park - Collector's Edition"}

And if you want info about the movie, you can get that, too: a commentary track by director Sam Raimi, actor Kirsten Dunst, producer Laura Ziskin, and co-producer Grant Curtis, plus a technically oriented commentary by the effects crew; pop-up factoids offering trivia about the movie and comic book; occasional Easter eggs leading to featurettes (e.g., 90 seconds on wrestler Randy Savage as Bonesaw McGraw); and promotional documentaries, screen tests, outtakes, and the like.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JMQW", "B000UR9T8C", "B004LWZWFQ", "B001DHXT20", "B00E5I2MCM", "B00005JNTU", "B001GCUO1Q", "B00005JNJV", "B000AYELVA", "B001CDR1FG", "B000VI70QS", "B0000959N0", "B000AYELVU", "B002GSXKN8", "B00E5I2MEK", "B0002IQMAM", "B0083SBMBM", "B001GZ6QC4", "B008JFUO72", "B00E5I2M6I", "B004LWZW42", "B004EPZ07K", "B0090SI56Y", "B00E5I2M9K", "B008QZ5PY2", "B00JPS7HOA", "B0007P0Y7C", "B000IJ79UW", "B000HCO83Q", "B001QB9H1U", "B000VR0570", "B000HEVZ9E", "B000OVLBF8", "B008JFUS0U", "B008JFUPFI", "B0000VCZLG", "B002A5EBLW", "B000I0RQVI", "B002ZG99B8", "B005G4TJUC", "B002IPFWTE", "B00005JM5E", "B001DJLD2G", "B000J10EQU", "6307397594", "B004LWZWGA", "B00006II6Q", "B000ARXF96", "B000P0J06K", "B00177YA1K", "B00004STUL", "B001OST0M6", "B0049IHX2C", "B0006L0LOS", "B00IGVJGYQ", "0767817478", "B008Y1YK9Y", "B000PGINMQ", "B0025AY3X8", "B002HWRYJE", "B002GSXKNI", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B000GFLKF8", "B00007G205", "B0002KVUKM", "B0060FXDCG", "B007K3JFUQ", "B00005N5S5", "B00000F4ZY", "B001GKJ2E8", "B006VRRGNK", "B00003CXTA", "B0007RT9MG", "B001VLBDD0", "B00F4FFO8E", "B000IJ79VQ", "B0000633UA", "B0000AXE8I", "B000H30B2C", "B0001BKAEY", "0790736411", "B00005JN0T", "B000UNYK4E", "B0001I55N8", "B000KJU1KK", "B00004Z4WR", "B000VNMMR0", "B0006GAO5Y", "B00005JKWJ", "B000U7WV1Y", "B00008G8M4", "B0009A409S", "B0001QNNS4", "B000O78KW4", "B00BEZTMFY", "B001TODCII", "B0009RCPY8", "B001PPLIEG", "B00003CY0V", "B00000JQB5"], "bought_together": ["B00005JMQW", "B000UR9T8C"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004LWZWFQ", "B003YAR97K", "B00005JMQW", "B000UR9T8C"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 9011}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.75, "brand": "Marvel Kids", "asin": "B00005JKCH", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5108SSFB9GL._SX300_.jpg", "title": "Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)"}

{"description": "Sydney Bristow (Jennifer Garner) is a super (and super sexy) spy, fighting nefarious villains and working for the good guys--or so she thinks. Recruited as a college freshman for espionage work, Sydney found her true calling with SD-6, a secret division of the CIA. When her hunky doctor-boyfriend proposes to her, she decides to let him in on the truth she's not supposed to tell anyone: she's not a grad student with a demanding job for an international bank, but a secret agent who constantly puts her life on the line for the free world. But when SD-6 discovers her security breach, her fianc&#xE9; is brutally assassinated, and Sydney suddenly finds herself face-to-face with the truth: she's been working for the bad guys. Deciding to become a double agent for the CIA and bring down the evildoers, Sydney gets one more surprise--her estranged father (Victor Garber) is also working for SD-6, and the CIA as well. Welcome to the family, Syd!Confusing? This is all just in the first episode ofAlias, the brainchild ofFelicitycreator J.J. Abrams that plays like a cross betweenBuffy the Vampire SlayerandJames Bond. With its double-edged tension (how long can Syd play double agent?) and one heck of a MacGuffin (the dreaded Rambaldi device, the mythic creation of a Renaissance genius), the show leads its viewers from episode to episode with visceral, compelling action, not to mention the nascent romance between Syd and her CIA handler, Vaughn (Michael Vartan), and her clashes with her heretofore distant father. Sharp, smart, and always suspenseful,Alias' center was held by the gorgeous Garner, a stellar action heroine and an even better actress who could pull off Sydney's exotic undercover missions and conflicted emotions with equal dexterity. By the end of this first season, which concludes with a breathtaking cliffhanger, you'll be seduced intoAlias' world with, happily, no desire to escape.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001MVWRNO", "B001MVWRMK", "B001MVWRMU", "B001MVWRN4", "B0001I55ZQ", "B004SJU51I", "B00008ZL4Q", "B0047BXR8U", "B000O77SMW", "B000O77SN6", "B0006UEVTK", "B003R4ZMQI", "B0047BXR9E", "B00GTZWUPS", "B0047BXR30", "B003UD7JEE", "B00005JNOG", "B000FFJYBQ", "B000TGURZ8", "B005FISC3Y", "B000FIMG68", "B0079IEPHK", "B000NDEXK2", "B00A8KJN8M", "B00HUPC5X8", "B006YG9HJE", "B00C57OVUQ", "B00H57HOSC", "B0009X76ZA", "B0007P0Y7C", "B0018CWEYY", "B000P6YNSE", "B00KHA9BQ2", "B0015RRNMA", "B000092T3Y", "B009LDD4V4", "B002DQSKME", "B00JF5GAZA", "B00079FUI6", "B003R0MEXQ", "B0051GOB2G", "B00BD6KXKW", "B0012CJQYG", "B0077PTWHI", "B007PKSO2Y", "B00133QNS6", "B003R0MEZO", "B000R7HRRA", "B00062IDEW", "B000MR8W92", "B00HEQOAIQ", "B00E8OMZGG", "B0018CWEZI", "B00170LCWC", "B000QFCDAO", "B009LDD1H6", "B0036EH3XE", "B001L5SRJE", "B000BZISRQ", "B000EXDS3E", "B0030VANIU", "B002KQ6UE2", "B0018CWEVW", "B000TM1CL0", "B00IWTVDUW", "B0060MYLCU", "B0077PTWY6", "B00080ZG2O", "0553375970", "B0058JEHTS", "B0053O8A46", "B00B5ARKC0", "B00BGQ2NIO", "B0002DRE72", "B000FL7CAK", "B00008972G", "B001QE99BA", "B001VPJZ0E", "B001C8W7EQ", "B000ICLRKC", "B0024FAR66", "B00008YGRU", "B001B7CNZ6", "B001AQMBKA", "B002JVWRD6", "B001VPJYZU", "B000EXDS34", "B003L77G2Y", "B0019LY5IM", "B00B58948U", "B00915G6TE", "B000FIMG4U", "B00EIXWMII", "B0001907BC", "B0058YPJ8G", "B000EXDS3Y", "B003F3NE7K", "B002JVWR4U", "B000AQ68SC", "B000SQFC2C"], "bought_together": ["B001MVWRNO", "B001MVWRMK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001MVWRN4", "B001MVWRNO", "B001MVWRMU", "B002NS2HBM"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 139345}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 24.25, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B00005JLF1", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51CTQ5VQ5AL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Alias - The Complete First Season"}

COMEDIAN also discovers the sharp wit of rising young comic Orny Adams -- outspoken, insecure, and fanatical about becoming the \"next big thing.\" What emerge are two fascinating journeys by two contrasting personalities who have some surprising parallels.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00000JWVS", "B003IQVMLY", "0553385739", "B003V6L978", "0743201256", "1879505541", "B00000AFGO", "0553096060", "0440502438", "B0000CDRW5", "B000C3L2NE", "0878300740", "B002L9N4Z6", "B0002B15I8", "0553569155", "B000F48D7I", "B001FRNB94", "B000B5MBZQ", "0887346472", "0325001790", "1884956661", "1586488961", "B00005LN3K", "B000NJL4SA", "B000MRA56K", "1416553657", "0615667112", "B004B93RC4", "B0004Z33FK", "1492386189", "B000077VQ6", "B0036VHJ5Y", "B000C20VIW", "030738229X", "0989387801", "B000TEUSLS", "B000EULSSE", "B0017600EW", "B001AXU1FK", "B00EYA6VGY", "B0010IOALG", "B000JMKKMW", "B001VFM5ZG", "B008H4MFSG", "1582973571", "B00005UO29", "B001D5C1FI", "B0007YXRCW", "B00HR6RF2Q", "1614641307", "B008LCRA98", "1879505215", "0764164732", "0977064107", "B000V6I6Q8", "B000J2BBIE", "B005MRMF2M", "1566080037", "B008LCRABQ", "1468004840", "1591023955", "B0064SVM5Y", "B001PKHS90", "B000BD1LB8", "B0001FVDHI", "B00EIJTLK4", "B001675YRK", "B002DQSKLK", "B000RF7Y0C", "B008LCRAC0", "B00BI440I0", "B000CSUNKW", "B00701QRCM", "B008LCRAFC", "B000G6BLDI", "1404915125", "B003BJO8I2", "B000P6R6Y2", "B0006FO5M8", "B00004STOW", "B00006RCNV", "B000FL7CBE", "1615931406", "B00BZW5ZAW", "B002PLPQLU", "B00433KF1E", "B000JJSKZY", "B000F1IO3O", "B002VKB0MO", "B000002KJ0", "B005PTYOX0", "B003X3BY8I", "B0000C237Y", "1907498370", "B001HB1JY2", "0060779241", "B001BEK88I", "B000803BPS", "B00006HAVX", "158648317X"], "bought_together": ["B00000JWVS", "B003IQVMLY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00000JWVS", "0553569155", "B003IQVMLY", "B00000AFGO"]}, "price": 11.75, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 119862}, "asin": "B00005JLW5", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51c2nXIs%2B2L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Comedian"}

{"description": "Tell you what: WhetherKing of the Hillcan usurp the throne occupied byThe Simpsonsas TV's royal animated family is something for the Hank vs. Homer contingents to duke out. But with this fit-for-a-king DVD set, the Hills of Arlen, Texas, can emerge from the shadows of their Springfield brethren. Co-created by Mike Judge (Beavis and Butt-Head, the cult classicOffice Space) andSimpsonsveteran Greg Daniels, this brilliant series boasts an impeccable voice cast, bull's-eye writing, and the most rollicking theme music on television.UnlikeThe Simpsons, which got a running start onThe Tracey Ullman Show, the Hills may take a little warming up to. In the pilot episode, Hank Hill (voiced by Judge) is more a quick-to-temper redneck than good ol' boy. But as this inaugural season unfolds, he empathetically struggles to be the voice of reason in an ever-changing world where his substitute teacher wife, Peggy (Kathy Najimy), is forced to teach sex ed (Hank's spit take when the repressed Peg blurts out the word \"vagina\" is worthy of Danny Thomas), his son Bobby (Pamela Segall) wants to be a prop comic, and his neighbor, Dale (Johnny Hardwick), finds government conspiracies under every grassy knoll. But Hank is that sitcom rarity: A good man and father who is devoted to his job (selling propane and propane accessories) and his family, which includes Peggy's niece, nubile aspiring beautician Luanne (Brittany Murphy). For the uninitiated, disc 2 of this three-disc set may make a more favorable first impression. It contains three of the season's best episodes, among them \"Shins of the Father,\" which pits Peggy against Hank's incorrigibly sexist father (when Peggy tells him that Bobby is a good helper in the kitchen, he responds, \"Whatever you say, Hillary\"). The set is loaded with features, from deleted scenes to episode commentaries by the series' creators and the characters themselves. Welcome to home video, Hills.

{"description": "That adorable Audrey Tautou fromAm&#xE9;lieplays the central role in this deceptive story of a rather unusual romance. It would spoil the film's clever design to reveal what happens halfway throughHe Loves Me, He Loves Me Not, so let's just say that Tautou plays a winsome girl in the sunny town of Bordeaux, whose relationship with a married doctor has more layers than first it seems. Samuel LeBihan, fromBrotherhood of the Wolf, plays the doctor, but it's the casting of cutie-pie Tautou that sets up the movie's gradually sinister undertow. Director Laetitia Colombani's inventive structure plays a satisfyingly tricky game with the audience, and may have some viewers going back to the beginning to make sure they saw what they thought they saw.

{"description": "The supplemental features ofFahrenheit 9/11offer almost an hour and a half of further manna for Michael Moore's supporters and ammunition for his critics, including appearances by two of the most memorable figures in the film, Michigan mother Lila Lipscomb and Marine corporal Abdul Henderson.  \"The Release ofFahrenheit 9/11\" (11 minutes) collects reactions to the film from celebrities, political leaders, and Quentin Tarantino and Tilda Swinton of the 2004 Cannes Film Festival jury (but no film critics).  Lipscomb gives a moving speech at the film's Washington, D.C. premiere (4 minutes), and in an 18-minute sequence, an embedded Swedish journalist recounts his experiences, accompanied by footage of U.S. soldiers raiding an Iraqi home.  This provides the context for the scene in the main film in which a soldier gets his picture taken with a bound and hooded Iraqi, which is chillingly similar to the infamous pictures from Abu Ghraib prison.  The second part of the DVD features consists of seven new or extended scenes (about 50 minutes total), including more footage of Iraq before the invasion; protesters outside Abu Ghraib and former prisoners showing their injuries; more thoughts from Cpl. Abdul Henderson; National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice trying to squirm off the hook in front of the 9/11 Commission; and President Bush going through the motions of a press appearance after he appeared before the same commission.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000UNYJXQ", "B0030Y11XS", "B00008DDVV", "B00009YXAS", "B00008K76O", "B0030Y11O2", "B0002RQ2Q2", "B001G43C1S", "B00008L3TE", "B0041KKYBA", "B00068VAOG", "B000T28C5Y", "B000ICL3KG", "B000BTH4K4", "B002FOQY7M", "B0002OXVBO", "B001NMT8R0", "B001MFNB5I", "B001MVWFAO", "0743272927", "B000FBH3W2", "B0007DBJM8", "B000UYX4N6", "B0027BOL4G", "B000U6YJMO", "B00G0PXU2Y", "B00005JPXA", "B000GYHRHO", "B002EP8TQG", "B000C3L2IO", "B000JVSUSE", "B004EPYZDA", "B0016N52IK", "B001BEK8FQ", "B0041KKYBK", "B00KY6YAO2", "B00F12IRSO", "B00DYC648S", "B001F5274G", "B0001L3LUE", "B000HWXOT0", "B005FITIGO", "B003CJXJ8Q", "B0013D8LHM", "B00DPUB5LK", "044653224X", "B005KBJC0I", "B004FQX59I", "B00KUS5YGC", "B007KAUWO2", "B00GYG8BKK", "B000093NQZ", "B001P9G3HE", "B00483VQTE", "B003Q6D28C", "B001B7CNW4", "B000BBOUHM", "B00744WZ8U", "B00066VTBW", "B001KWB0L0", "B00443YDWK", "B000059TG8", "B000JLTRIQ", "B003JUINFM", "0060392452", "B000I5Y8FU", "B000BITURA", "B003XKNGLY", "B004EPYZDK", "B003M987AG", "B000PY52IG", "B006ML50QK", "B000QGE89W", "B00EK52XQK", "B00DENQEE6", "B000GH3CR0", "B0047UJBP4", "B00005J75F", "0446693790", "B0006N2DSI", "B001AEF6HM", "B00005JLYW", "B001J66JQI", "B000O0YV7O", "B002NPCJRC", "B00AZMFG48", "B0042KZJIC", "B00827OX5Q", "B0002HDXTQ", "B001E5FYS8", "B00AEBB89C", "B003H23KSM", "B000CEXEWA", "0615602223", "B006JN86VW", "B00914YLAG", "B0001IXT36", "B008PUI1GM", "B004SIP7ZS"], "bought_together": ["B000UNYJXQ", "B0030Y11XS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000UNYJXQ", "B0030Y11XS", "B00008DDVV", "B0002OXVBO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 44430}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.0, "brand": "From HIBISCUS EXPRESS, http://www.amazon.com/shops/AXD9LOVGJXES3", "asin": "B00005JNEI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51KDRVF1JGL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Fahrenheit 9/11"}
{"description": "Despite super effects, a huge budget, and the cinematic pedigree of alien-happy Steven Spielberg, this take on H.G. Wells's novel is basically a horror film packaged as a sci-fi thrill ride. Instead of a mad slasher, however, Spielberg (along with writers Josh Friedman & David Koepp) utilizes aliens hell-bent on quickly destroying humanity, and the terrifying results that prey upon adult fears, especially in the post-9/11 world. The realistic results could be a new genre, the grim popcorn thriller; often you feel like you're watching Schindler's List more than Spielberg's other thrill-machine movies (Jaws,Jurassic Park). The film centers on Ray Ferrier, a divorced father (Tom Cruise, oh so comfortable) who witnesses one giant craft destroy his New Jersey town and soon is on the road with his teen son (Justin Chatwin) and preteen daughter (Dakota Fanning) in tow, trying to keep ahead of the invasion. The film is, of course, impeccably designed and produced by Spielberg's usual crew of A-class talent. The aliens are genuinely scary, even when the film--like the novel--spends a good chunk of time in a basement. Readers of the book (or viewers of the deft 1953 adaptation) will note the variation of whom and how the aliens come to Earth, which poses some logistical problems. The film opens and closes with narration from the novel read by Morgan Freeman, but Spielberg could have adapted Orson Welles's words from the famous Halloween Eve 1938 radio broadcast: \"We couldn't soap all your windows and steal all your garden gates by tomorrow night, so we did the best next thing: we annihilated the world.\"--Doug ThomasWar of the Worldsat Amazon.comThe SoundtrackThe War of the Worlds(1953)War of the Worlds - The Complete First Season(TV series)Classic Sci-Fi Movies and Their RemakesAliens Invade on DVDThe Prog-rock Opera (no kidding)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEBB8VK", "B00005JL78", "B001SGEUYW", "B00008G8M4", "B00005JL3T", "B0013FDM7E", "B00AEFXNLY", "B00005JMXX", "B001OQCV2E", "B000VECAD0", "B002O3Z510", "B0002V7OI8", "B000H30B2C", "B000EGDB10", "B00005JN2Z", "B005LAIIMG", "B005PTYP70", "B002O3Z50G", "B0002V7ON8", "B00005JN0T", "B00K2CHW48", "B002SJIO4A", "0783225547", "B008JFUO36", "B00005JKLZ", "B00AS1Q93S", "1936594056", "B004EPYZUS", "B001TUZG4K", "B00AEFXR1K", "B00001ZWUS", "B00AEFXYJA", "0767817478", "B0034G4ORC", "B003QO8TOQ", "B00070FX5U", "B0045HCJSA", "B00000G3PA", "B005LAIHPE", "B003Y5H5GK", "B00AEBBA72", "B00003CWU3", "B00I9TDMRM", "B001ECDVKE", "B00003CXXP", "B000V4UFZK", "B0010X73ZG", "B001DZOC6Y", "B00005JKFR", "B000XT1P4S", "B003HKN52U", "B0009PW4D2", "B000HRMAPE", "B004EPYZPS", "B0018QPPXW", "B0002WZTOI", "B00AEBB9LO", "B004LWZW4M", "B003ABZHAO", "B003YJFALS", "B0087ZG7HK", "B000OT6V64", "B004P7CN7W", "B000CCBC9O", "B00000ILDD", "0767803434", "B001L57ZYM", "B000065V3G", "B007STBUHI", "B002ZG980U", "B008JFUQZ2", "B00005B6JZ", "B0006GANOQ", "B000F1IQN2", "1494343576", "B001GCUO02", "B00004Y87O", "0783226810", "B004EPYZSK", "B000P0J0BU", "B005LAIHXQ", "B001680M26", "B000EQHXN2", "B0045HCJFS", "B00004BZIY", "B00008G8M5", "B00003CXQA", "B008JFUS0U", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00EIN6KJ0", "B0000DZ6N3", "B000MV8A9A", "B00005JKYX", "B0000YEEGM", "B000TGJ8CQ", "B0013FCWUW", "B002ZG9864", "B00003CWTI", "B008MIMWQW", "B00IKM5OCO"], "bought_together": ["B00AEBB8VK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AEBB8VK", "B004LWZW4M", "B00005JL78", "B004EPYZSK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 18739}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.95, "brand": "Dreamworks Skg", "asin": "B00005JNTI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51upxzPRnXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "War of the Worlds"}

{"description": "Movies don't come any bigger than Peter Jackson'sKing Kong, a three-hour remake of the 1933 classic that marries breathtaking visual prowess with a surprising emotional depth. Expanding on the original story of the blonde beauty and the beast who falls for her, Jackson creates a movie spectacle that matches hisLord of the Ringsfilms and even at times evokes their fantasy world while celebrating the glory of '30s Hollywood. Naomi Watts stars as Ann Darrow, a vaudeville actress down on her luck in Depression-era New York until manic filmmaker Carl Denham (a game but miscast Jack Black) entices her with a lead role. Dazzled by the genius of screenwriter Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody), Ann boards the tramp steamer S.S.Venture, which she--and most of the wary crew--believes is headed for Singapore. Denham, however, is in search of the mythic Skull Island, hoping to capture its wonders on film and make a fortune. What he didn't count on were some scary natives who find that the comely Darrow looks like prime sacrifice material for a mysterious giant creature....There's no point in rehashing the entire plot, as every movie aficionado is more than familiar with the trajectory ofKing Kong; the challenge facing Jackson, his screenwriters, and the phenomenal visual-effects team was to breathe new life into an old, familiar story. To that degree, they achieve what could be best called a qualified success. Though they've assembled a crackerjack supporting cast, including Thomas Kretschmann as theVenture's hard-bitten captain and young Jamie Bell as a plucky crewman, the first third of the movie is rather labored, with too much minute detail given over to sumptuous re-creations of '30s New York and the unexciting initial leg of theVenture's sea voyage. However, once the film finds its way to Skull Island (which bears more than a passing resemblance toLOTR's Mordor),Kongturns into a dazzling movie triumph, by turns terrifying and awe-inspiring. The choreography and execution of the action set pieces--including one involving Kong and a trio of Tyrannosaurus Rexes, as well as another that could be charitably described as a bug-phobic's nightmare--is nothing short of landmark filmmaking, and a certain Mr. Spielberg should watch his back, asKongtrumps most anything that has come before it.Despite the visual challenges ofKing Kong, the movie's most difficult hurdle is the budding romance between Ann and her simian soulmate. Happily, this is where Jackson unqualifiedly triumphs, as this unorthodox love story is tenderly and humorously drawn, by turns sympathetic and wondrous. Watts, whose accessibility balances out her almost otherworldly loveliness, works wonders with mere glances, and Andy Serkis, who digitally embodies Kong here much as he did Gollum in theLOTRfilms, breathes vibrant life into the giant star of the film without ever overplaying any emotions. The final, tragic act of the film, set mostly atop the Empire State Building, is whereKongearns its place in movie history as a work that celebrates both the technical and emotional heights that film can reach.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"bought_together": ["B000EHQTZO", "B00AEFYEU8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000EHQTZO", "B00AEFYEU8", "B0087ZG7HK", "0767817478"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 32487}, "categories": [["Movies & TV"]], "price": 8.94, "brand": "Universal Studios", "asin": "B00005JO20", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/513Y54TGdwL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "King Kong (Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "More than a few critics hailedSpider-Man 2as \"the best superhero movie ever,\" and there's no compelling reason to argue--thanks to a bigger budget, better special effects, and a dynamic, character-driven plot, it's a notch aboveSpider-Manin terms of emotional depth and rich comic-book sensibility.Ordinary PeopleOscar-winner Alvin Sargent received screenplay credit, and celebrated author and comic-book expert Michael Chabon worked on the story, but it's director Sam Raimi's affinity for the material that bringsSpidey 2to vivid life. When a fusion experiment goes terribly wrong, a brilliant physicist (Alfred Molina) is turned into Spidey's newest nemesis, the deranged, mechanically tentacled \"Doctor Octopus,\" obsessed with completing his experiment and killing Spider-Man (Tobey Maguire) in the process. Even more compelling is Peter Parker's urgent dilemma: continue his burdensome, lonely life of crime-fighting as Spider-Man, or pursue love and happiness with Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst)? Molina's outstanding as a tragic villain controlled by his own invention, and the action sequences are nothing less than breathtaking, but the real success ofSpider-Man 2is its sense of priorities. With all of Hollywood's biggest and best toys at his disposal, Raimi and his writers stay true to the Marvel mythology, honoringSpider-Mancreators Stan Lee and Steve Ditko, and setting the bar impressively high for the challenge ofSpider-Man 3.--Jeff ShannonDVD Features:The first commentary track is by director Sam Raimi and a self-deprecating Tobey Maguire speaking in tandem, and producer (and Marvel CEO) Avi Arad and coproducer Grant Curtis speaking in tandem. They discuss a number of topics, including Raimi's memory of his excitement over Richard Donner's Superman and how the character of Black Cat had to be dropped from the film. The second commentary is by six members of the Oscar-nominated effects team, and one of their primary focuses is how Doc Ock's arms were achieved by a combination of puppetry and CGI.The centerpiece of the second disc is a massive two-hour documentary that can be viewed all at once or in 12 separate pieces. It covers the development of the story, the visual effects, costumes, stunts, and sound and music. Three shorter featurettes cover Peter Parker's struggle between his personal and hero lives, Doc Ock, and the women in Spider-Man's life, and what's interesting is how they discuss those topics not just in relation to the movies but to the comic books as well. (For example, Betty Brant and Gwen Stacy had a much greater impact in the comics.) There's a scene in which you can toggle among three different camera angles, and a gallery of 17 paintings Alex Ross created for the opening sequence.

{"description": "The trend is to convertmovies into stage musicals, butThe Producersgoes a step further: making a feature film of the smash-hitstage musicalthat was adapted from the1968 film. The chief drawing card, of course, is Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick reprising their roles from the stage. Lane plays Max Bialystock, a legendary Broadway producer who hasn't had a hit show in a long time. Enter nebbish accountant Leo Bloom (Broderick), who tells Bialystock he could actually make more money with a flop than a hit. So the two set out to produce the worst Broadway musical of all time, one guaranteed to close on opening night, with the collaboration of an outrageous cast of characters: Will Ferrell as sieg heil-ing author Franz Liebkind, Uma Thurman as Swedish bombshell Ulla, Gary Beach as director Roger De Bris, and Roger Bart as his assistant, Carmen Ghia, among others.As directed and choreographed by Susan Stroman (who did the same honors on Broadway) and co-written by Mel Brooks,The Producersis laugh-out-loud funny. It's also a relentlessly over-the-top, shamelessly bawdy, stereotype-ridden comedy that may turn off its audience just as much as its centerpiece,Springtime for Hitler, was intended to. But Broadway fans who are used to larger-than-life figures who play to the back row while showering the first row with spit, are likely to forgive and just enjoy the famous granny-walker dance, a supporting cast dotted with Broadway performers (playing a taxi driver is Brad Oscar, who originated the role of Liebkind on Broadway then later played Bialystock), or the mere spectacle of seeing Lane and Broderick memorializing the performances that millions never got a ticket to see. (For maximum laughs, stick around through the closing credits.)--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000BMY2LU", "B00005AY6I", "B000BJS4TE", "B00005OCJO", "B00C7A8X4Q", "B004SEUJBE", "B000G6BLYC", "B000E6ESIK", "0786868805", "B0001ZX0O2", "B000E1YVZU", "0792844890", "0792833198", "B001LMAKAG", "B00AEBBAEK", "B000077VR3", "B00007GZRN", "B00001PE59", "B0007TKNII", "B009NYF2GQ", "B0013Z7RUC", "B000G6BLVA", "B002D0L0R2", "B0001Z4OXS", "B002NZK5TG", "B000G6BLWE", "B000G6BLW4", "B000G6BLQU", "B007XTDWKQ", "B00003CX8U", "B0038Z5SOM", "B000BITUNE", "B000E6ESJ4", "B0000AM6IY", "B00008973A", "B000G6BLRE", "B00004W5VC", "B000ATQYVK", "630530209X", "B00GTO6WXU", "6304806418", "B00004XMTJ", "B0060QSGJ0", "B001GKJ2DY", "B002JT69LE", "B001MT7ZEW", "B000I2J6YG", "B000ASDFGI", "0783240287", "B00AMQGCD6", "B005S9EK5Y", "B007LNBS2I", "B0000BWVMQ", "B002D0L0QS", "B000RPCK2E", "B000649YA2", "B00004RFEZ", "B00BX8PG3Y", "B008SBXFUU", "B00AEFYVUQ", "B005NFJAZS", "B0090XLDKY", "B00007J5VN", "B00005UQ8F", "B001PO550A", "B00005JLIU", "B00020X88E", "B00AEFY5TI", "B00DHN8GBC", "B00005JL1P", "B00KRFE9UK", "B00005OCMS", "B002ZG976U", "B00003CXJA", "B004H0M2X2", "B006GHA9QQ", "B000NTM9ZM", "B002N1C1CO", "076781326X", "B00067BBLY", "B000BT970O", "B000BYA4J2", "B00006D295", "B000067IZ3", "B005SFR7YE", "B001MVYUQ6", "B00AATV0WS", "B00DL48BM6", "B000G6BLT2", "B004VJJFDE", "6305161879", "B0000714BP", "B002HK9IDQ", "B001KP2J3K", "B00AEFXDO6", "B00EPH8SBM", "B0000BZK1R", "B00006RZ9Y", "B00005O3VC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000BMY2LU", "B000E6ESIK", "0792844890", "B004SEUIWO"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 391998}, "asin": "B00005JO24", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514E4E65KRL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Producers"}

{"description": "Critics and controversy aside,The Da Vinci Codeis a verifiable blockbuster. Combine the film's huge worldwide box-office take with over 100 million copies of Dan Brown's book sold, andThe Da Vinci Codehas clearly made the leap from pop-culture hit to a certifiable franchise. The leap for any story making the move from book to big screen, however, is always more perilous. In the case ofThe Da Vinci Code, the plot is concocted of such a preposterous formula of elements that you wouldn&#x92;t envy screenwriter Akiva Goldsman, the man tasked with making this story filmable. The script followsDan Brown&#x92;s bookas closely as possible while incorporating a few needed changes, including a better ending. And if you&#x92;re like most of the world, by now you&#x92;ve read the book and know how it goes: while lecturing in Paris, noted Harvard Professor of Symbology Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) is summoned to the Louvre by French police to help decipher a bizarre series of clues left at the scene of the murder of the chief curator. Enter Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou), gifted cryptologist. Neveu and Langdon team up to solve the mystery, and from there the story is propelled across Europe, ballooning into a modern-day mini-quest for the Holy Grail, where secret societies are discovered, codes are broken, and murderous albino monks are thwarted&#x85; oh, and alternative theories about the life of Christ and the beginnings of Christianity are presented too, of course. It&#x92;s not the typical formula for a stock Hollywood thriller. In fact, taken solely as a mystery, the movie almost works--despite some gaping holes--mostly just because it keeps moving. Brown&#x92;s greatest trick was  to have the entire story take place in one day, so the action is forced to keep moving, despite some necessary pauses for exposition. As a screen couple, Hanks and Tautou are just fine together but not exactly memorable; meanwhile Sir Ian McKellen&#x92;s scenery-chewing as pivotal character Sir Leigh Teabing is just what the film needed to keep it from taking itself too seriously. The whole thing is like a good roller-coaster ride: try not to think too much about it--just sit back and enjoy the trip.--Daniel VanciniVisit The Da Vinci Code StoreOn The DVDThe DVD extras on a film as popular asThe Da Vinci Codeshould be plentiful, and this version doesn&#x92;t skimp. With over 90 minutes of special features, including ten behind-the-scenes featurettes, there&#x92;s a lot here to explore beyond the film itself. The question is, is there anything new here that we haven&#x92;t heard before, in all the hype, pseudo-documentaries, and controversy surrounding the movie, to make it worthwhile?  For most viewers, the answer will be \"yes.\" Essentially, if you like the movie, if you enjoyed the book, you will get a lot out of them.Just as the movie is intended to make the book come to life, the DVD extras should make the film come to life by pointing the audience into the world of the filmmakers, connecting the dots between print and film, and for the most part they do just that. The extras here range from the typical look behind-the-scenes to more in-depth features on the supporting characters, the locations, and theMona Lisaherself.  \"First Day on the Set with Ron Howard\" features the director gushing about the opportunity to film in the Louvre and work with Tom Hanks again (the two worked together before onSplashandApollo 13). It&#x92;s a short piece that doesn&#x92;t reveal much beyond making an attempt to share Howard&#x92;s excitement (with the \"Gee, I really loved working with him/her on this project\" that you hear in every such featurette), but viewers might enjoy seeing how the stage was set up in the famous museum, down to the spike tape on the floor showing actors where to hit their marks.The Filmmaking Experience, Parts 1 and 2further explores the creative and technical aspects of the filmmaking process.A Conversation with Dan Brownstarts out feeling like a puff-piece (the man who wrote this book got started at age 5 with a story calledThe Giraffe, The Pig, and the Pants on Fire. \"It was a thriller,\" he says.) and unfortunately it doesn&#x92;t go very deep into much of anything of interest. But on the other hand, this isn&#x92;t60 Minuteshere; it&#x92;s intended to give viewers a better sense of the man behind the franchise, which it does.  Much of the footage from this interview is sprinkled throughout some of the other featurettes. Meanwhile, the character behind the franchise, Robert Langdon, is examined in his own featurette, as is Sophie Neveu. The cool thing here is getting under the skin of the actors to see how they approached the characters, knowing that most of the movie-going public already has formed their own ideas about the characters from the book.The most interesting extras are the featurettes that focus on the history behind the mystery. Or is it the mystery behind the history?  Either way, the first one on theMona Lisa, and the second featurette on the many codes and symbols that are hidden throughout the movie balance out the remainder of the extras nicely by demonstrating the sense of intrigue, mystery, and game-playing adventure that madeThe Da Vinci Codeso popular in the first place.--Daniel VanciniBeyondThe Da Vinci CodeThe Films of Tom HanksThe Films of Ron HowardThe Da Vinci DVDs: Decoding \"The Da Vinci Code\"More About The ArtistStills fromThe Da Vinci Code(click for larger image)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002O5M4T4", "B00005JN5E", "B0013BM63O", "B002ZTQVKM", "B0007XG02W", "B001OLP2TI", "B002C68WNW", "0307474275", "B002O5M4SU", "B00005JLSB", "B000PHVZNE", "B0077ATSSQ", "B00AEFY0F2", "B000EPR7NE", "0743486226", "B001LMAK9W", "B000P0J0EW", "0385504209", "B005HWAOP2", "B001OQCV2E", "B0013XZ2QK", "B001EZE5D8", "B00005JL3T", "B000EOTW0Q", "6304711891", "B000YDBPAM", "0307950689", "B000HT386M", "B00008G8M4", "B000P0J0EM", "B002ZG99KO", "0800141806", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B00001ZWUS", "B0002V7OI8", "B002O3Z50Q", "B0006GANOQ", "B002NZK5UU", "B000NQRR1Q", "0385504225", "B004SIP7ZS", "B00005Y71F", "B000OYC7BW", "B00DL48BM6", "B00026ZG10", "B0018CWW5K", "B00004BZIY", "B0000B1OFL", "B00023B1LC", "B000N6U0E2", "B00A8MGIZG", "B00005JM5E", "B002LMV7R0", "B00004Z4WR", "B000K2UGXO", "B00005JMYC", "B001MVYUQG", "B00005JLWN", "B000056PMU", "B0000AOV4I", "B00AEFY4CG", "B00441GYXS", "B001F12J0C", "B00ES28X3C", "B002ZG980U", "B001VLBDD0", "B00008K76U", "B001TK80C0", "B008JFURII", "B000VWYJ86", "0792159659", "B00AEFYGBA", "B0009MDPYM", "B00177YA1K", "B00005N5S5", "B0043X1FM2", "B0002J58HO", "B00005JM5B", "B00AZMFJYA", "B003AWRMBA", "074349346X", "B003VA3JUO", "0783240295", "6305767866", "B0000844I8", "B000065U1N", "B002GHHHKQ", "B000K7VHQE", "B0000AXE8I", "0800177258", "B000ASDFGI", "B003Q6D2B4", "B000HRMAPE", "B000U7WV1Y", "B00005JMOW", "B00GPWEPZ8", "0312944926", "B000VI70QS", "B000KF0GWW"], "bought_together": ["B002O5M4T4", "B00005JN5E"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002O5M4T4", "B00I563DSC", "B0013BM63O", "1400079152"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 7555}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.5, "brand": "DaVinci", "asin": "B00005JOC9", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51SLBDLMtIL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Da Vinci Code (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition)"}

{"description": "Helen Mirren reigns supreme inThe Queen, a witty and ingenious look at a moment that rocked the house of Windsor:  the week that followed the sudden death of Princess Diana in 1997. Diana's death came at just the same time that Prime Minister Tony Blair (played by the bright Michael Sheen) was settling into his new government--and trying to figure out the delicate relationship between 10 Downing Street and Queen Elizabeth II (Mirren). A large portion of the British population was trying to figure out the Windsors that week, as Elizabeth remained stiff-upper-lip and largely mum about the death of the beloved princess. In Peter Morgan's skillful script, we watch as Blair grows increasingly impatient with the Royals, who are sequestered in their Scottish estate while the public demands some show of grief. Prince Philip (James Cromwell, in good form) clumsily decides to take Diana's sons hunting, while a sympathetically-treated Prince Charles (Alex Jennings) displays some frustration with his mother's eerie calm.None of this conveys how funny the film is, or how deftly it flows from one scene to the next. Director Stephen Frears (Dirty Pretty Things) deserves great credit for that, and for the performances, and for the movie's marvelous sense of well-roundedness; you could see this movie and groan at the cluelessness of the Royals and their outmoded existence, or you might just sympathize with showing reserve in a world that values gross public displays of emotion. But either way, you'll marvel at Mirren, who makes the Queen far more alert and human than one might ever have imagined.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B003UESJH4", "B001C4AFOY", "B004M9QNVK", "B004GXKBDI", "B0059XTUVI", "B000Z8H0IC", "B000ZOXDFA", "B000RF7XYO", "B001L57ZZG", "B001TH92N4", "B000BKDNX0", "B0006Q93H4", "B000EOTELI", "B004XYOQU4", "B009TT0BSE", "B0012QE4Q2", "B001QUF3SW", "B007HW8U2Y", "B000EHQUGC", "B00342ANSA", "B004SIP9U6", "B000V02CNW", "B00005O7N8", "B00GM7STPI", "B003N9ASF2", "B002ZG99EK", "B004SIP71M", "B003Y5H4Y8", "B0001I55M4", "B001AZIRVI", "B00015HXDG", "B000E1NXJ0", "B000RF7XYY", "B00121QGPY", "B009AMANBA", "B000M06KJ8", "B000MEYJHY", "B00005JOFQ", "B007TBJUVI", "B0085A9JXG", "B003AND1SM", "B000NIVJF4", "B0010X73Z6", "B000K7VHQE", "B00005JKNF", "B000MCH5P4", "B001TR4G6W", "B004P7CNZO", "B0050PYNN0", "B000GH3CR0", "B00AEFY8MM", "B0068MNO4S", "B002RSDW80", "B001MVWFAO", "B004ZNFTDQ", "B000255LIY", "B000V6LSOA", "B00ARX2VZW", "B000G6BM0K", "B008220C38"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003UESJH4", "B004M9QNVK", "B001C4AFOY", "B004GXKBDI"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "asin": "B00005JPAM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51K34G0GCBL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Queen"}

{"description": "For anyone who thought the Oscar-winning documentaryMarch of the Penguinswas the most marvelous cinematic moment for these nomads of the south, you haven't seen nothing yet.Happy Feetis an animated wonder about a penguin named Mumble who can't sing, but can dance up a storm. George Miller, the driving force behind theBabe(andMad Max) movies, takes another creative step in family entertainment with this big, beautiful, music-fueled film that will have kids and their parents dancing in the streets. From his first moment alive, Mumble (voiced Elijah Woods) feels the beat and can't stop dancing. Unfortunately, emperor penguins are all about finding their own heart song, and the dancing youngster--as cute as he is--is a misfit. Luckily, he bumps into little blue penguins and a Spanish-infused group (led by Robin Williams) and begins a series of adventures. Miller has an exceptional variety of entertainment: Busby Berkley musical numbers, amusement-park thrills, exciting chase sequences (seals and orca lovers might like think otherwise), and even an environmental message that doesn't weigh you down. Best of all, you don't know where the movie is going in the last act, a rare occurrence these days in family entertainment. A fusion of rock songs, mashed-up and otherwise, are featured; this movie is as much a musical as a comedy. Mumble's solo dance to a new version of Stevie Wonder's \"I Wish\" by Fantasia, Patti, and Yolanda may be the most joyful moment on camera in 2006.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0006UEVT0", "B001DPHDCY", "B0006JMLRK", "B0012EM5D8", "B004HO6I4M", "B004EPZ0AC", "B002WJI2QQ", "B000AY74OG", "B0000AOX0O", "B00BG0RSJ4", "B00005JNQS", "B000RMJ4F8", "B0000640SC", "B005SDUV4E", "0783231474", "B00003CXJ4", "B00CWM58WY", "B0000VV4W2", "B0042U94UQ", "B0039N74CW", "6305161887", "B00AEFXMSS", "B000M343BC", "B00007LVCM", "B001ECQ75A", "B00005JNS0", "B00000JL8E", "B000GUJZ00", "B000056H26", "B008NNY9QW", "B004EPZ034", "B00G5G7EXY", "B000LPS2VI", "B005LAIH4A", "B00F522C7C", "B005LAIISA", "B00GDT5T9Y", "B007FF3HQM", "B000VBJEEG", "B003H9M1Q2", "B00029LO0Y", "B008JFUQ16", "B00005JMQZ", "B00EV1YZ96", "B000ION23A", "B0013FSL3E", "B003ZHVJGO", "B002ZG97YM", "B001NCDFTW", "B004G600A4", "B00009YXAW", "B005LAIHW2", "B00AFEX83C", "B00475B0H6", "B000UVKGPI", "B00ALMNCLQ", "B00HLTD2OE", "B00005JM7T", "B001HN6922", "B000BI5KV0", "B0013FSWT2", "B0030IIZ4M", "B004ODLUGM", "B001GCUO7A", "B005F96UJ6", "B000UFIYOO", "B000G75AZC", "B00005QFE1", "B0000VCZKW", "B00IEXX4KS", "B001THIQFO", "B000A2WAQK", "B001GCUNWQ", "B00B7EQPNE", "B002NZK5SW", "B0007PIDBQ", "B00AOCDDGC", "B000V5IP6U", "B0044RFTD8", "B00AEFXMGU", "B001KVZ6FW", "B00CHVJODE", "B000CZ0PT4", "B006JD48LO", "B0007Z0NYG", "B00EBBGLFC", "B00003CXB4", "B000BMGEJI", "B008YWY0HK", "B0002YLCOM", "B00E9ZATJO", "B004A8ZX3C", "B00I6JOD2S", "B005G3VCYY", "B00CQRN3QI", "B004OWQTZ0", "B0001OGUQI", "B004EPZ01G", "B00005JMFH", "B000GIXEWC"], "bought_together": ["B004HO6I4M"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004HO6I4M", "B00EBBGLFC", "B00G5G7EXY", "B00HR3D56O"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 21763}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.51, "brand": "Warner", "asin": "B00005JPCF", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51sX2Hrdz6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Happy Feet (Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "The Dark Knightarrives with tremendous hype (best superhero movie ever? posthumous Oscar for Heath Ledger?), and incredibly, it lives up to all of it.  But calling it the best superhero movie ever seems like faint praise, since part of what makes the movie great--in addition to pitch-perfect casting, outstanding writing, and a compelling vision--is that it bypasses the normal fantasy element of the superhero genre and makes it all terrifyingly real.  Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) is Gotham City's new district attorney, charged with cleaning up the crime rings that have paralyzed the city. He enters an uneasy alliance with the young police lieutenant, Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman), and Batman (Christian Bale), the caped vigilante who seems to trust only Gordon--and whom only Gordon seems to trust. They make progress until a psychotic and deadly new player enters the game: the Joker (Heath Ledger), who offers the crime bosses a solution--kill the Batman. Further complicating matters is that Dent is now dating Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal, after Katie Holmes turned down the chance to reprise her role), the longtime love of Batman's alter ego, Bruce Wayne.In his last completed role before his tragic death, Ledger is fantastic as the Joker, a volcanic, truly frightening force of evil. And he sets the tone of the movie: the world is a dark, dangerous place where there are no easy choices.  Eckhart and Oldman also shine, but as good as Bale is, his character turns out rather bland in comparison (not uncommon for heroes facing more colorful villains). Director-cowriter Christopher Nolan (Memento) follows his critically acclaimedBatman Beginswith an even better sequel that sets itself apart from notable superhero movies likeSpider-Man 2andIron Manbecause of its sheer emotional impact and striking sense of realism--there are no suspension-of-disbelief superpowers here. At 152 minutes, it's a shade too long, and it's much too intense for kids. But for most movie fans--and not just superhero fans--The Dark Knightis a film for the ages.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B00DUCXFUC", "B004LWZWGK", "B000PC6A3E", "B002ZG981E", "B00G4RD4PQ", "B0039208QM", "B001GMALGY", "B00E2Y0YBK", "B00C2IGQBA", "B0039208JE", "B00H14WTLQ", "B0039208CG", "B0085D3I3K", "B0039208C6", "B000M5AJQI", "B00319ECGK", "B001FB55H6", "B00EIG5M5A", "7020070078", "B00E2Y6AUY", "B00D5FMGGS", "B001OQCV6K", "B0013FBS20", "B000Q6GX5Y", "B001GKJ2FC", "B00FPS79F6", "B001992NUQ", "B004JMSIRC", "B001RIY4WE", "B00DYEN6XC", "B008QZ5PY2", "B001F7MSG6", "B00FAHYNWE", "B00J7PRJXU", "B001AQT0Z4", "B001UV4XEW", "B0083SBJXS", "B00AEFY552", "B00C8RD79O", "B007KAJG3K", "B007L4HET8", "B004EPZ07U", "B007L4HFDI", "B00AEFXKOO", "B000PC0U1W", "B00C6B8TB8", "B00HINFI4K", "B003TT2X6I", "B001KZIRM2", "B002ZG99NG", "B00EZ4M68G", "B004SIP90G", "B003ZHR6RK", "B001GCUO16", "B003TT2X6S", "B00JNEWSLS", "B001F3FUK6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00DUCXFUC", "B004LWZWGK", "B002ZG981E", "B000PC6A3E"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "asin": "B00005JPY0", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51pGxSkkz4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Dark Knight [Theatrical Release]"}

{"description": "Amores Perrosroughly translates to \"Love's a bitch,\" and it's an apt summation of this remarkable film's exploration of passion, loss, and the fragility of our lives. In telling three stories connected by one traumatic incident, Mexican director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu uses an intricate screenplay by novelist Guillermo Arriaga to make three movies in close orbit, expressing the notion that we are defined by what we lose--from our loves to our family, our innocence, or even our lives. These interwoven tales--about a young man in love with his brother's pregnant wife, a perfume spokeswoman and her married lover, and a scruffy vagrant who sidelines as a paid killer--are united by a devastating car crash that provides the film's narrative nexus, and by the many dogs that the characters own or care for. There is graphic violence, prompting a disclaimer that controversial dog-fight scenes were harmless and carefully supervised, but what emerges fromAmores Perrosis a uniquely conceptual portrait of people whom we come to know through their relationship with dogs. The film is simultaneously bleak, cynical, insightful, and compassionate, with layers of meaning that are sure to reward multiple viewings.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JL57", "B0041KKYF6", "B00008AOX5", "B000N3T0DW", "B001UV4XC4", "B0001CNRRU", "B0002TT0MI", "B002FHGESI", "B0036TGSJE", "B00005JNCZ", "B00AEFXGIY", "B00005JLQW", "B00080Z53O", "B000O76ZQC", "B00006G8G3", "B002M2T1VI", "B000FII31A", "B000GETTJI", "B00180IPM6", "B004XVMCMG", "B0041KKYFG", "B000K2V7F0", "B004SIP6GI", "B000YIGNCC", "B003O3EKRO", "B001S400C0", "B00005LZOD", "B002VECLXC", "B002H0LCGM", "B005HFI7IU", "B0007OCG5G", "B0011FLH14", "B008S2NABI", "B00GJNQ3S0", "B000JBXH78", "B0052LE7C4", "B000RHRGSK", "B001BNFR8U", "B000UUX2SW", "B00AEFXGAW", "B000LV6OC6", "B002M2T1V8", "B009AVCA6W", "B00KE3B8HC", "B004SIP7S0", "B00003CXRG", "B0042EJDGM", "B001MWBK6I", "B0032AJVE6", "B003R9IET0", "B00000F7E6", "B005Q4CKLC", "B00AZMFKXK", "B000274TLW", "B00432M43C", "B000H0M4AW", "B002BWP3UC", "B004PKNYK4", "B0004Z32NI", "B0007NBJHI", "B00E1S1MMM", "1572526599", "B0047685T6", "B0051T46YG", "B0000TPA56", "B0015ET3YO", "B000WC38IC", "B000OVLBGC", "B00JV0547O", "B002BWP3UM", "B001QX014A", "B000LXHFMW", "B00000F5KH", "B002BWP4A6", "B000N3SU6K", "B001R4XRLC", "B004DF3S84", "B000A7Q1O2", "B00112S8RS", "B00GHH9HJA", "B00075VX2C", "B00000G02H", "B001M9ELV2", "B00004RJ71", "B0036TGSJO", "B001M5BF7Y", "B00000F3CD", "B0001CNQX0", "B00003CWTI", "B000M7Y4S0", "B000QXDCLK", "B00003CWSX", "B0001VO38S", "B0002VEZ3U", "B000067IZ3", "B002QFYJF4", "B000N3T0DM", "B000NA6C2M", "B0000A2ZTY", "B001MYIXAC"], "bought_together": ["B00005JL57", "B000N3T0DW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0041KKYF6", "B0002TT0MI", "B002FHGESI", "B000O76ZQC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 23708}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.12, "brand": "LION&#39;S GATE ENTERTAINMENT", "asin": "B00005N8A9", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51X0QYZB1NL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Amores Perros"}

He's the ultimate anonymous man, and he's mad as hell and not going to take it anymore. Painting his masklike visage like a tribal warrior, he hunts down and kills his tormentors. Romero takes an odd pleasure in Flemyng's perverse self-help campaign, as if his savage explosion is some form of primitive personal growth.

{"description": "Douglas Fairbanks carries his adventurous spirit high into the Andes in The Gaucho, an inventive and playful comedy thriller. Fairbanks reveals new facets of his formidable talents and demonstrates an uncommonly fierce bravado that makes even his simple act of lighting a cigarette a marvel of machismo.  Armed with a pistol, the requisite sword and exotic Argentine bolas (which he hurls with remarkable skill, disabling his foes and, in one delightful scene, entwining himself with Lupe Velez for an especially intimate tango), Fairbanks shines as the reckless titular ne'er do-well. His appetites for adventure, women and riches lead him to the City of the Miracle, a colossal shrine carved in a mountainside which houses a young girl (Geraine Greear) gifted with the power to heal. When the shrine is robbed by a pack of bandits, the roguish gaucho becomes its unlikely savior in an adventure with as many dramatic peaks as the Andes themselves, lightened by raucous comedy and flavored with moments of haunting beauty. The Gaucho's relative darkness of tone makes it one of Fairbanks's most fascinating pictures today.

{"description": "John Frankenheimer updates the mutant-monster films of the 1950s with a modern environmental twist in this well-meaning but clich&eacute;-ridden late-'70s horror film. Robert Foxworth is so earnest it hurts as a rabble-rousing ghetto doctor who packs up his pregnant wife (Talia Shire) and heads out to the Maine woods to investigate claims of environmental pollution. That's the least of his concerns when a gooey mutant grizzly goes on the rampage and he joins forces with Native American activist Armand Assante (wearing his humorless resolve like war paint) to get out of the woods. Frankenheimer is a good director saddled with a bad, blunt script, and like a pro he delivers the requisite gore and even racks up the tension in a terrific opening chase. But even he can't overcome the clumsiest collection of deformed woodland creatures to claw their way through a monster movie.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00KUCR3LC", "B00IYJRIKO", "B00AEFYSR2", "B000RO9PV4", "B0007R4TR6", "B000CSTKGA", "B000G296X4", "B00HRUQB8Q", "B002NN7EY2", "B00I099JO6", "1606730266", "B000JU8H56", "B0002C9DK4", "B000HT38B2", "B004CZZZEK", "B0002I838G", "B00IA1VKVY", "B000FFJZO2", "B00153ZR8G", "B005ETANC2", "B00K8EVSVI", "B005OT80W2", "6305943133", "B004TPJNAA", "B004S8UTII", "B00AEBB8VK", "B000FGFBUS", "B00005JP4N", "B00HFWETZ8", "B00KDU8HQQ", "B004GF3IJU", "B000A2XA78", "B00BTYXNQE", "B000AQKU72", "B008XTVWHK", "B00005KH30", "B008UFUL6K", "B000HXDWNM", "B001AR0D6I", "B00J81S92S", "B000TUDBFC", "B00I462XF2", "B00IQAUO2A", "0792846885", "B00005LIRD"], "bought_together": ["B00KUCR3LC", "B00AEFYSR2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00BTYXNQE", "B00AEFYSR2", "B004CZZZEK", "0792846885"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 41472}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 16.75, "brand": "SHIRE/FOXWORTH/ASSANTE", "asin": "B00005RDAI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41-Bsq6Mz6L.jpg", "title": "Prophecy: The Monster Movie"}

{"description": "They're here, they're queer, and they makeSex and the Citylook like a demure tea party. Showtime's quintessentially AmericanQueer As Folk--based on the British miniseries--pours on copious amounts of hot and steamy sex. This slick (and slickly entertaining) series shares the same basic concept as its British counterpart--centering on a group of gay friends living in a primarily industrial city--but after that, all bets are off. Whereas the British version focused on the gritty, realistic drama of its characters, the AmericanQAFis a glossy, fun soap opera that occasionally tackles big issues but never lets you forget that life at times can be a party, and you shouldn't be one of those poor suckers starving to death. A good part of the show's charm lies in its cast--boy-next-door Michael (Hal Sparks), ruthlessly seductive rake Brian (Gale Harold), out-and-proud Emmett (Peter Paige), wallflower Ted (Scott Lowell), and nubile teen Justin (Randy Harrison)--who grew from standard gay prototypes to intriguing characters by the first season's end. And while some subplots didn't work (such as Emmett's farfetched foray into gay-conversion therapy), others were quietly affecting, including Brian's coping with his father's death. Some may object to the show's relentless fixation on sex (and gay men--there are just two lesbian characters), but this is a series that in its own polished way is both engrossingly fun and truly groundbreaking. It's liberating to watch an American TV series in which the straight world is only peripheral.

{"description": "In his first starring role, Albert Finney gained international acclaim for his  impressive  (TheNew Yorker) portrayal of Arthur Seaton, a rebellious factory worker who lives only for his wild, carefree nights at the pub. A remarkable and influential drama that captures the despair of working class life, Saturday Night and Sunday Morning is 'superbly enacted [and] one of the best ofBritain's 'angry young men  dramas of the  60s.  (Leonard Maltin).  The sights and sounds of industrial Nottingham resonate with a grimy thud as Arthur Seaton works his tedious factory job. Through ale, women and practical jokes, he vents his frustrations against the  establishments  of work and marriage until his reckless ways lead him to a night that changes his life. Forced to reevaluate his convictions, Arthur must decide exactly what he stands for", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00CLF821Q", "B00005PJ6W", "B000XPSC16", "B000A1GKPI", "B00002VW6M", "B000OPPAEW", "B00097DY2A", "B000055ZF8", "B001L2S1WU", "B000UJ48VS", "B00G7QQ1Y0", "B00004TJKI", "B001LMAK6A", "B001LXIDUO", "0780618564", "B000EHSVQO", "B0007WFUGK", "B0035ECHIG", "B000063K2Q", "B00J2PQYYK", "B001BEK8E2", "B004ALIG4M", "B00F98FOI6", "B001CB42AU", "B001LXIDUY", "B001LMAK7E", "B00AQ6J64O", "B00GPPXNIK", "B00005AUKD", "B00ICWO1LC", "B00143XE00", "0802131859", "6305999872", "B00006FMCR", "B00005EBSB", "B00005B1ZL", "B000EBD9TE", "B004ALIG1U", "B00005AUKB", "B0083V2W6I", "B002E01MBA", "B002MT3DG0", "B000B83846", "B00002E20R", "B00096S4B2", "B000TXNDVQ", "B001CW7ZT4", "B00F6SHGF8", "B00004W229", "B0007ZEOQE", "B00005O06J", "B000059TON", "B004WPYO7E", "B00005U2KC", "B000B8384Q", "B00I116MZ2", "B00ATK02FO", "B0006GAOJA", "B000HC2LHG", "B0009X75EC", "B0045HCIZE", "B008K1PXIK", "B004C2523M", "B0048O2YWG", "B00K6D1QV8", "0780022823", "0780022343", "B006TTC5WC", "B00AEFY3TA", "B0007ZEO8C", "B000CNESU8", "B00006AW0I", "B008CB8CJK", "0792838947", "B000EQHXNW", "0452295777", "B0001FVDGY", "B003ZYU3U0", "B0002DB52M", "B000244EWO", "B00003L9CI", "B001EKP5D2", "B000A2WJBQ", "B0000ALFVD", "B0000549B1", "B000CNE088", "B001CC7PM6", "B005KQVE1S", "B000E33W0I", "B00E18QKJ2", "B007PM218K", "B000ION7AI", "B0030BOCFU", "630589423X", "B009X919UE", "B00079ZA68", "B00HGBAG5K", "B000M2E3GI", "B00005A8TX", "B008BSM1CI"], "bought_together": ["B00CLF821Q", "B000XPSC16"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000XPSC16", "B000UJ48VS", "0307389650", "B0028O9XN6"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 54792}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.98, "brand": "FINNEY,ALBERT", "asin": "B00005S8KV", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ASPE5R9KL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Saturday Night and Sunday Morning"}

{"description": "HBO's violent men-behind-bars drama is an addictive, testosterone-driven soap opera for guys. The eight episodes of the first season set the style for the show: a massive cast of a vivid characters on both sides of the bars, four or five stories unleashed at a breakneck pace and framed by angry, oddball introductions, and a soaring casualty rate. Created byHomicideproducer Tom Fontana, this drama quickly earned its rightful reputation as the most brutal show on TV. It's simple chemistry: combine volatile ingredients in a confined space, shut tight, and shake.The yellow brick road of the Oswald Correctional Facility (affectionately known as \"Oz\" among the inmates) leads to \"Emerald City,\" an antiseptic cellblock of cement and glass overseen by prison-reform advocate Tim McManus (Terry Kinney). The first episode introduces its two most compelling inmates: meek lawyer Beecher (Lee Terguson), who transforms from a vulnerable lamb to a fearless, drug-addicted wildcat, and Muslim activist Kareem Said (Eamonn Walker), a fiercely non-violent leader whose campaign for reform explodes in a season-climaxing riot. The stunning first-season cast also features Ernie Hudson (the warden), Rita Moreno (a worldly drug-counseling nun), and Edie Falco (who jumped from her role as a single-mother prison guard to mob wife inThe Sopranos). It carries no rating, but the drug use, nudity, and brutal violence make this highly inappropriate for young viewers and unsuited to the squeamish.Ozpulls no punches in its portrayal of prison violence and predatory abuse.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00000FBH2", "B0000Y40PW", "B00031TYBC", "B0009GV9E6", "B000G1R4TS", "B0002ERXC2", "0060521333", "B0006IUD9Y", "B00A2JP6V2", "B00123BY6S", "B004YOEDR4", "B000FTCLSU", "B00316DDYA", "B000QXDJLI", "B00003CXOP", "B005SEDI5M", "B0001KL5DA", "B0012CJQY6", "B000NA1VI2", "B00DJYJRHG", "B005NFJAWG", "B0007R4SWM", "B00005NOHO", "B00G4EWJ1O", "B008PJZDXW", "B001OQCVFG", "B0007YMVWO", "B000067S1G", "B000Q6GUW0", "B00008PW1F", "B002ZCY8CC", "B0015TX2LO", "B000BO7DWI", "B002N57KGM", "B0020TS5EM", "B0009NZ2W4", "B000LC3ID8", "B00C8CQRQ4", "B00HW3EXCE", "B002FLOTPE", "B00EEDNR9A", "1484177010", "B0024FAD92", "B004BZ5AHI", "B0009IW88K", "B00B52F278", "B0002I84JO", "B00005RIY5", "B003XWEQ8E", "B0028RXXE8", "B000FKO3GW", "B0012CJQYG", "B003PIUBZS", "B00ADQPB50", "B00188XHF8", "B0034G4OSG", "B009TE9HAW", "B00004XPPB", "B000CRR31U", "B0012CJQZ0", "B008H6GHF6", "B001FB4W0W", "B00CWIMVDW", "B000CR7RCK", "B0024FAD9C", "B000E6EK42", "B00EIL7E9C", "B004HW7JMO", "B0012CJQYQ", "B0024FAR5M", "B000EULSR0", "B002N5N5M0", "B001AQMBF0", "B000GH3CWK", "B000XCZGXG", "B0019NJW0G", "B00DXP7L88", "B0060MYKYY", "B009LDD54K", "B0014FAIV6", "B000Q6GUKW", "B000GTLQVW", "B00CG4XKNM", "B000V86OKG", "B00JF5GAZA", "B0055SNHQG", "B00B5J6A7W", "B002N5N5QQ", "B006OB3K56", "B0041KKZKA", "B0072OFM28", "B000NVI2GU", "B00004U103", "B00BGI076M", "B009PNHSYY", "B00ECHBSP8", "B007TBIUSM", "B00A4Y61NM", "B002N5N5MK", "B00382S9T6"], "bought_together": ["B00000FBH2", "B0000Y40PW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000G6BL42", "B0000Y40PW", "B00000FBH2", "B0009GV9E6"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 10670}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 27.99, "brand": "Warner Brothers", "asin": "B00005Y6YJ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51UjJ5OPyNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Oz: Season 1"}

{"description": "This is the beginning of a beautiful friendship. As its ratings following the tragic events of September 11, 2001, illustrated,Friendshas matured into television's most beloved comfort show. The peerless ensemble--Jennifer Aniston, a pre-Arquette Courtney Cox, Emmy winner Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry, and David Schwimmer--makes a lasting first impression in the first season's 24 episodes, which are presented chronologically on four discs. The perky \"Pilot\" introduces unlucky-in-love Monica, runaway bride Rachel, sad sack Ross, New Age ditz Phoebe, wise guy Chandler, and womanizer Joey. The focus of the first season is Ross's unrequited love for Rachel, but we have these moments to remember: the arrival of Marcel the monkey (\"The One with the Monkey\"); Monica, Rachel, and Phoebe's \"cleansing ritual\" (\"The One with the Candy Hearts\"); the escalating game of shower peek-a-boo (\"The One with the Boobies\"); Joey as Al Pacino's butt double (\"The One with the Butt\"); Ross taking lessons from Joey in how to \"talk dirty\" (\"The One with the Stoned Guy\"); former \"Must-See TV\" stars Helen Hunt and George Clooney (\"The One with Two Parts\"); and Chandler spilling the beans to Rachel about Ross's feelings for her (\"The One Where Rachel Finds Out\"). Though its devoted fans can recite these episodes chapter and verse,Friendsmaintains its sparkle through repeat viewings, a testament to the sharp writing as well as the cast's lightning-in-a-bottle chemistry and lived-in performances. The episodes are presented uncut and extended, with previously unseen dialogue and scenes. And those who hateFriendsand would like to drown the characters in the opening credits' fountain are directed to the episode \"The One with the Boobies,\" in which guest star Fisher Stevens hilariously nails the \"dysfunctional group dynamic ... co-dependent, emotionally stunted, sitting in your stupid coffeehouse and you're all like, 'Define me, define me.'\" Among the set's special features are an informative \"Pilot\" episode commentary by the show's creators, who at one point reveal that Monica was originally conceived as a Janeane Garafalo type (how's that for a road not traveled?). More obsessed fans can take a virtual tour of coffee shop Central Perk, the center of theFriendsuniverse, or match wits with the \"How Well Do You Know Your Friends?\" trivia quiz.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000068CNX", "B0000844MI", "B003TNW04Y", "B0000C2IXN", "B003TNW030", "B0006ZM8M2", "B003TNW03K", "B0001AW066", "B003TNW03A", "B005IA9JQ8", "B005IA9JQI", "B005IA9JRM", "B005IA9JSG", "B00005JLEX", "B005MG8UNG", "B00020HAWY", "B000HT3P7E", "B00B1LKXPY", "B008L0YMZA", "B0009VBTP0", "B008L0YN18", "B000TM1CKQ", "B000W91RUG", "B003SNJO5S", "B00005JO9J", "B000ERVK5S", "B0001BS3IY", "B00B04NJ1M", "B002N5N4M6", "B00009Y3RW", "B000NOKFH6", "B00B04NII6", "B00IVLRA62", "B0019CSXAM", "B002N5N4FS", "B0000E32X2", "B001BNFR6M", "B0058JEHTS", "B00005JLIC", "B0002UE1WQ", "B0024FAR6Q", "B00EQ2KU7G", "B00008AOX3", "B00382S9SW", "B00008NV4G", "B0058J3S16", "B0002I838Q", "B000RF1QE2", "B000GETTKM", "B000YA82GA", "B0024FAD8I", "B002BJGYTY", "B001VPJYZ0", "B007C8RZL0", "B003R0MF3A", "B003SNJXMC", "B0000CGNEC", "0792845773", "B0007YXRCW", "B004GJYRFA", "B001A4VH2U", "B0019Z3P84", "B003L77GDS", "B002WC89WK", "B00005JNOG", "B007C8RZQ0", "B000SINT4S", "B00004RFCM", "B0015I2S74", "B00382S9UA", "B0030VANIU", "B008LCRAFC", "B002JVWR7M", "B007C8RZJW", "B006JSXYPA", "B008KZX7W0", "B000R9YLKY", "B005GT3XD6", "B002JVWQSW", "6305428034", "B000HT3P6U", "B00133QNS6", "B00AG473GE", "B000QFCD7W", "B00382S9U0", "B00382S9TQ", "B000WQWPRS", "B0032UYFAQ", "B008LCRA98", "B006WZIB1C", "B003Y5H574", "B00FRILRW0", "B00AEFYM2S", "B000BOH98G", "B0038N9X3Q", "B003L77GE2", "B00133QNSG", "B003VTKZA2", "B002DPPH6W", "B0058JEHSO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005IA9JVI", "B005IA9JQ8", "B00B1LN8WY", "B000068CNX"]}, "price": 1.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 48009}, "asin": "B00005YU81", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HRCAPXNAL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Friends: Season 1"}

{"description": "The 1985 seriesTatakae Cho Robot Seimetai Transformers(\"Fight Super Living Robots Transformers\") was a U.S.-Japanese coproduction, written in America and animated in Japan. Based on a line of robot toys from Takara--licensed to Hasbro in America--that could be reconfigured into cars, trucks, planes, etc., it spawned numerous sequels and a feature. Civil war rages on the planet Cybertron between the virtuous Autobots and the evil Decepticons. Both sides launch crews into space to find new energy sources, but the ships crash on Earth and are buried in lava. When the robots awaken four million years later, the Decepticons, led by the dictatorial Megatron, want to drain the planet of its resources, enslaving or destroying mankind. The Autobots ally with humanity and befriend oil-rig worker Spike Witwicky. The Saturday morning-style cheat of cutting to a logo, rather than animating transitions, and the frequent pauses for commercial breaks make for very choppy storytelling. The designs of the robots are interesting but lack the graphic sophistication of Yoshiyuki Tomino'sGundamMobile Suits. The animation is very limited, and the choreography of the battle sequences lacks the panache of Tomino and other more talented directors. LikeRobotech,Transformerswill appeal most strongly to adults who watched the show as kids: it's remained popular through Web sites, role-playing games, fan fiction, and a lively trade in the original toys. Serious students of anime will find this early series of historic interest.

{"description": "Retelling a story that has made it onto the silver screen more than most, this latest adaptation of The Count of Monte Cristo makes yet another swashbuckling attempt to win over a new generation of cinema goers. A dashing James Caviezel takes the role of the Count, who is driven by a desire for revenge after being betrayed by his best friend Fernand (played by a dishevelled Guy Pearce) and landed with 16 years of solitary confinement in Chateau D'If, a damp cavernous prison. Thus the scene is set for a good old-fashioned romp. The trouble with this \"re-imagining\" (to borrow a phrase from Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes) is that it's never quite sure whether to take itself seriously or not. Alexandre Dumas's original story is a traditionally melodramatic tale of deceit and double-crossing, with clear-cut bad guys and a moral lesson to be learned at the end. Here, director Kevin Reynolds appears unsure about whether to stick with tradition or bring the story up to date and turn it into a post-modern play on the old Victorian values and style. When the Count and his heavy-breathing loved one are reunited, their kiss is actually framed as a cameo. Both lead actors are also prone to heavy bouts of overacting, garnishing their performances with exaggerated baroque gestures. Clearly this is a film in which the actors could over-indulge themselves and (almost) get away with it, were it not for the fact that--bar Richard Harris as the \"Priest\"--none of them seem to have the faintest idea about how to conduct themselves in a period drama. This Count of Monte Cristo will leave the audience a little confused as to whether they should cry along with the story or laugh along with the actors. --Nikki Disney On the DVD: The Count of Monte Cristo on disc offers no escape from the dry drawl of director Kevin Reynolds, who features in almost every element of the extensive extras package. With a shy studio disclaimer before his commentary, he's got a refreshingly frank attitude to", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792839137", "6305428077", "B001EAWMGA", "B000U34PM6", "B000CEXGAU", "B00DCRE87O", "B000ARXF96", "B00004YA66", "B0002HOEPI", "B000BFJM26", "B002U0KHNS", "B00BC0JGUW", "B00005NRO0", "B0064MT1L2", "B000A50442", "B000HC2LZS", "1411469488", "B002AK9URM", "076781505X", "0140449264", "B0007N19X2", "B002VWNID6", "0800141601", "B00062IVOY", "0822003260", "B0002235R6", "B000ENC5YW", "B000P0J0EW", "B00006ZXSO", "B000056PMU", "9626340398", "B00AEFYUQQ", "B000056VP4", "B00CHMBQM0", "B005S9EK5Y", "B001ECDVJU", "B000NVT0SO", "B0001NBMEE", "B00006L949", "B00AEFYO5I", "B0002TSZI8", "B00005LOL0", "B0002YLCG0", "B004SIP75S", "B00081U7HC", "B00004TJJV", "0553213504", "B004SIP9RO", "6304765266", "6304711905", "B00096S4DK", "B0006N2EZ0", "B002K0WBXW", "B000093FLA", "B00AEBB8YW", "B00AEFZ2DG", "B00006ZXSK", "B006P0FIGU", "B002GHHHJC", "0783222149", "B00005JM5B", "B000YGDNPO", "B004IK30MI", "B00096S49Y", "B00860YICC", "6304711891", "B00006ZXSI", "B000FVQLQQ", "B00005JMOW", "B00866JL96", "B000LP6KNU", "B00005PJ8T", "B00004WG2F", "B00000G3PA", "6305428115", "6305692688", "B000E1ZBGS", "B001ECDVK4", "B00000F4ZY", "B00AEFXESQ", "B00028HBKM", "B0041SI78O", "B000BITVBA", "B00003CXFV", "B004SIP7ZS", "B001E75QH0", "6305213283", "6305416222", "B00066FB52", "B0034G4P94", "B00AEBB9NM", "B000P0J0DS", "B00DHHWXYY", "6305127646", "6305236569", "B009LDD1H6", "6305128952", "B00005ATZT", "B0074JOUHE", "6304698798"], "bought_together": ["0792839137", "6305428077"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0792839137", "0140449264", "B000CEXGAU", "B000U34PM6"]}, "price": 12.5, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 231677}, "asin": "B000063W1R", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51LYMHVq8EL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Count of Monte Cristo [Region 2]"}
{"description": "Behind the Sunis a rapturous Western, a big film about a big, unwanted destiny visited upon a vulnerable, young hero. Adapted from the novelBroken Aprilby Albanian writer Ismail Kadare (the story has been transferred from Europe to Brazil's rugged, northeastern badlands in  1910),Behind the Sunconcerns two families and their long-running land war, which has robbed many a young man of his hope, love and, ultimately, life. Sent by his aggrieved father to avenge the slaying of an older brother,  Tonho (Rodrigo Santoro), in torment, carries out his bloody, ancestral obligation and then proposes a truce between the families. Director Walter Salles (Central Station) aims to make a magnificently crafted, lush, and exotic epic told in broad strokes for art house aficionados, and he succeeds almost to a self-conscious fault. Still, there is nothing like a stirring, archetypal tragedy about the endless repercussions of violence and the sacrifice of innocence to a dubious cause.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00000F5KH", "B00075YVTE", "B002W2U8V0", "B000J3OTOG", "B0002LJTIG", "B00195FU82", "B001CDFY2I", "B004SIP6GI", "B0006354CA", "B00005JNCZ", "B004EBT81I", "B001BOCCPA", "B00375LBM6", "B000056C0E", "B000068QP0", "B0012OSGV8", "B00022FW4U", "B000GNOGW4", "B00004Y7CZ", "B00AX7PGQS", "B004XVMCMG", "B006IW8E3Y", "B00GMV8L1Q", "B003N2CVOU", "B000FIHNHU", "B001GD6VTY", "B0009X75EM", "B000J10F8W", "B00080Z53O", "B0016GOLZM", "B00ANRG3YW", "B0036TGSJE", "B000O599ZS", "B00GSBQ2HU", "B004WJT5G0", "B001MYIXAC", "B00000IXPN", "B0006TPDVG", "0764129163", "B005Q4CKLC", "B000I0RNV6", "B0045HCIY0", "B0007QJ1V6", "B004SIP8W0", "B004SEUIXS", "B00005N5RO", "B0028SBFZQ", "B000LPS4IY", "B0000E6EL1", "B000A59PNS", "B003W1QFPI"], "bought_together": ["B00075YVTE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004SIP6GI", "B00097E6MM", "B00075YVTE", "B000J3OTOG"]}, "price": 19.98, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 109133}, "asin": "B0000640VQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51uPSMmAN4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Behind The Sun (2001)"}

{"description": "Despite a roster of disreputable films that includes everything fromBloodsucking FreakstoTerror Firmer, Troma Films' crowning achievement remains its comic book tribute/parodyThe Toxic Avenger(1985) and its pair of 1989 sequels. The comedy/action/sci-fi effort, about a crime-fighting monster spawned from chemical sludge, is as proudly crude as Troma's other films, but also genuinely funny and competently directed by company chiefs Lloyd Kaufman and Michael Herz. The combination of slapstick and splatter helped earn the film the broadest audience recognition of any Troma film prior toTromeo and Juliet&#x96;&#x96;so much so, in fact, that several years later, the Toxic Avenger would be given his own Saturday morning cartoon.Troma's affection for Toxie is made abundantly clear withThe Tox Box, a lavish (by the company's standards) four-disc package that contains the three features as well as four episodes ofToxic Crusaders, Toxie's animated adventures. Troma fanatics should note that that the discs forToxic Avenger IandIIIare largely identical to versions that were released independently within the last few years, but the disc forToxic Avenger IIis a true \"uncut\" version (with more violence) that differs markedly from the previously released R-rated DVD. As with all Troma DVDs, each disc is packed with supplemental material, from Lloyd Kaufman's hilarious (and often unhinged) commentary to a wealth of excised scenes, trailers, and production stills.Toxic Crusaderseven includes a pair of '40s-era serials in their entirety to fill out its scant running time. Cineastes may decry that lowbrow material such as this has been given the deluxe treatment, and even Toxie fans may wonder if this much Troma is good for their mental health, but DVD buyers must admit thatThe Tox Boxis an embarrassment of riches.--Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["6304723172", "B000GDIBXY", "B001BP14MG", "B0007989KC", "630505892X", "630472313X", "6304852436", "B0002M5TRA", "B00124OB0I", "B00A429Y56", "B009IV2Z3M", "B00BCMSY80", "B000ASATZ8", "6304852444", "B002VRNIAO", "B00000IQW4", "B00JPUUQVE", "B00EVU3S0E", "B003THSXJ6", "B00CPTUNZG", "B000056L2U", "B001D5C1PS", "B004XVMCH6", "B0002VEV0M", "B008CYDDWI", "B00C7A8WZQ", "B00AJXO4FA", "B000Q66Q8I", "B00004YLAU", "B002ZPIBOU", "B00D7AM71A", "B00BHLTIXQ", "B000S0GYRU", "B00AZ7V0W0", "B00HZN8S9U", "B000JMKKK4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000GDIBXY", "6304723113", "630472313X", "B0007989KC"]}, "price": 41.78, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 87088}, "asin": "B00006G8IS", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51D3BM25EAL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Tox Box (The Toxic Avenger - Unrated Director's Cut  / The Toxic Avenger Part II - Unrated Director's Cut / The Toxic Avenger Part III - Unrated Director's Cut / Toxic Crusaders: The Movie)"}

The \"How to Ride a Horse\"  sequence inThe Reluctant Dragon(1941) set the pattern for many of these  cartoons. An elegant narrator (artist John Ployardt) explains a sport that Goofy  attempts to demonstrate. The character that animator Art Babbitt described in a  1935 lecture (quoted in the DVD bonus material) as an easygoing dimbulb gave way  to an enthusiastic but spectacularly maladroit figure. One of the funniest  entries in the series, \"Hockey Homicide,\" contains several studio in-jokes:  dueling stars Icebox Bertino and Fearless Ferguson, and referee Clean-Game  Kinney are named for artists Al Bertino, Norm Ferguson, and director Jack  Kinney.During the '50s, Goofy was transformed into a genial suburban Everyman in such  domestic sitcoms as \"Fathers Are People,\" \"Two Weeks Vacation,\" and \"Father's  Day Off.\" The animators reduced his floppy ears and buck teeth, improved his  posture, and gave him a brisker walk. The best-known short from this period is  \"Motor Mania\" (1950), a mildly didactic spoof of American behavior on the road  that was shown in driver's education classes for decades.

{"description": "With a new time slot (8:00 p.m. Saturdays) and three first-season  Emmys&#xAE;,All in the Familywas primed for greatness, and these 24 episodes  represent the series at its best. Carroll O'Connor leads the perfect cast as  blue-collar bigot Archie Bunker, and the standout classic is \"Sammy's Visit,\" in  which black, Jewish rat-packer Sammy Davis Jr. visits the Bunker home, where  he's hilariously horrified by Archie's prejudicial ignorance. The script was  written by comedian Bill (\"Jos&#xE9; Jiminez\") Dana, and to borrow Archie's phrase,  it's a pip, as Sammy turns Archie's racist remarks on their ear to the delight  of young liberals Gloria (Sally Struthers) and husband Mike (Rob Reiner).  Sammy's parting kiss on Archie's cheek is one of the series' all-time  highlights. Then there's Burt Styler's Emmy-winning script for \"Edith's  Problem,\" in which Archie's \"Dingbat\" wife experiences the mood swings of  menopause (another first, along with impotence in \"Mike's Problem,\" in the  series' taboo-busting candor). A showcase for Jean Stapleton (who deservedly won  her second consecutive Emmy), it also demonstrates (as does \"Archie and Edith  Alone\") the hurtful repercussions of Archie's unintentional cruelty. Edith's  Archie-baiting cousin Maude (Bea Arthur) is introduced (\"Maude\" is a pilot for  the character's spin-off sitcom, which premiered in '72), and creditmustbe given to John Rich, who directed all 24 episodes (winning an Emmy for  \"Sammy's Visit\") with a flawless sense of ensemble chemistry, precision timing,  and lasting political relevance. This season earned seven Emmys overall,  including awards for O'Connor and Struthers. Given such a wealth of sitcom  glory, it's a shame these DVDs are devoid of retrospective features.--Jeff  Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002E58FT2", "B002E58FUG", "B002E58FTM", "B002E58FTC", "B002E58FU6", "B000TD2KY2", "B000255LG6", "B000TD0PHG", "B005KK2FTO", "B00465I13S", "B00008R9MC", "B00007KK5J", "B000068V9Y", "B000CCBCCG", "B000068V9X", "B000MGTQ6G", "B00008EY6N", "B0007OCG74", "B0000BV1XX", "B000YGGNGK", "B00IJZW35I", "B001DSNEME", "B00005JLIC", "B000AMJG5I", "B000MGBSH6", "B00GOC760U", "B000A0GXGK", "B001OXLGK0", "B0000B1A5A", "B00096S480", "B00007KK5I", "B0000DFZ5O", "B00008NV4G", "B0002NY8R6", "B000286S42", "B0001O3YHQ", "B000NJMJHA", "B00GLT2SOA", "B000G0O5JG", "B002JH2EJM", "B000QUEQ6I", "B008L36520", "B0001NBNIY", "B00D2UMHB0", "B00GOC74OI", "B000BOH8YQ", "B000B5XOTS", "B00DJYK1XU", "B0002Y4T7O", "B0002W4SX6", "B00D2UMHSI", "B0002JZT5U", "B000A9QKSM", "B000A0GOQ4", "B000MEYKAA", "B000EGDAO8", "B000YKYT1M", "B000CELOW2", "B0085Z6Z2O", "B0011N19HI", "B000WQWPSW", "B001DMVZJ4", "B000291Q3Y", "B00009VRF0", "B0000E32X2", "B008KZX7W0", "B0085Z6ZD8", "B0001AVZDU", "B001DMVZJO", "B00A2L1CJK", "B0007Y08P6", "B000PHX5KU", "B00005JO3P", "B00D2UMI7I", "B00000F5W8", "B000HIVIOM", "B0007WQHFS", "B0006IUDYY", "B00008EYBH", "B000K7UBXE", "B000BVM1TG", "B008K1PWMW", "B0058J3S16", "B0009B16TO", "B0000V4906", "B008VNI9EW", "B0007KTBJO", "B0002NY8PI", "B007JVM69Q", "B002FLOTFO", "B00FM4S7P4", "B000E1MXWI", "B00IP965IO", "B009V2KO9K", "B0001ZMWXW", "B000KGGIL4", "B000EBGFQI", "B000BITV1A", "B00FFARI7I"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002E58FT2", "B008HUSFTS", "B002E58FTM", "B000WN5DYS"]}, "price": 10.29, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 91142}, "asin": "B00007KK5K", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51nSvglNU8L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "All in the Family - The Complete Second Season"}

Joining this scientific survey is long-haired vampire slayer Jason Scott Lee, who seems to have stalked in from another picture--but never mind Roy Scheider, whose wizened priest might be onscreen for all of 60 seconds. After a reasonably lively opening half-hour, this cheapie devolves into the usual blood-letting and illogical behavior. Some of the vampire lore is pretty diverting (did you know a vampire must untie every knot he sees?), butDracula IIis strictly for enthusiasts of the genre.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0007US7D0", "B00003CXSD", "B00JJ3EHCG", "6305258287", "B000TGJ80S", "B002ZG98N2", "B005LAIH54", "B000VSDNFA", "B00006FD9N", "B005LAIH2C", "B000G1ALDY", "B0002KVUKM", "B00AEBB91E", "B000SAGGSC", "B004M1A21K", "B000EQ5V8G", "B004EPYZOO", "B00AS1Q93S", "B00007AJG3", "B000HT38FS", "B0000640SF", "B000OU0826", "B00005BCKJ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005CFBZWK", "B00003CXSD", "B000069I1I", "B0007US7D0"]}, "price": 9.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 127656}, "asin": "B00008DDUZ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4146E2Q7AML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Dracula II: Ascension"}

{"description": "TheIdentityDVD features are not quite as enticing as they sound.  Of chief interest is the extended branched version of the film (available in widescreen only), but there's only one added scene (an interesting but not critical minute-long sequence that would have been the first conference-room scene), and the differences in the alternate ending are so subtle that you'll miss them if you literally blink a few times.  There's no question it could affect audience perception, but unlike most alternate endings, it doesn't affect the actual outcome.  (Seespoilerfor more information.)  The four deleted scenes (which don't include either of the above-mentioned additions) aren't that exciting, and the optional director commentary notes that these deletions generally served to cut moments of character and comic relief in favor of moving the story along, which is one reason the film runs a brisk 90 minutes. James Mangold's director commentary on the feature is good, though, as he discusses such matters as the logistics of the perpetual downpour and a crucial bit of dialogue removed from the film's climax.  Considering that downpour and the contrasting darks and lights of the film, picture quality is good, and the thunder claps sound great in 5.1 sound so there are no complaints about the DVD's presentation of the film itself.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000TJ6PBK", "B00006AUJR", "B0009YA3OA", "B000DZ7YN8", "B00005JNY3", "B00AADAK5W", "1558908382", "B00008K77D", "B0002DB54A", "B000RGN2JI", "B00AEBB8NI", "B000P0I4O4", "B00003CXZ4", "B004ZNFTDQ", "B0015XHQVC", "B00026ZD04", "B00014NEZI", "B003LR5BD0", "B00092ZLSK", "B004SIP92O", "B00000JGHL", "B003VA3JUO", "B00BNH9NCU", "B00DZP1C2W", "B00I45844W", "B004YCKKFK", "B00011CZRE", "B0002234LS", "B001HVZOB6", "B005S9EJ8W", "B000A2UBN4", "B00HOGBXS6", "B000OYC7BW", "B0004Z31OS", "B00AEBB89W", "B00AEFXW8I", "B00009OWJY", "B002NZK5RI", "B00AEFXEGS", "B00007AJF8", "B003ASLJQ8", "B000R4SMCW", "B000069HZP", "B00003CXGA", "B00005V9HH", "B0001FR3IQ", "B00005JPT0", "B000SK5Z20", "B00008YJDK", "B0013D8LBS", "6305238065", "B0021L8UFI", "B004P7CN7W", "078322799X", "B001OQCV2E", "B0002WT4OE", "B00B6OEB18", "B00003CXKM", "B004SIP9RO", "B000RZIGUE", "B004B3PBFQ", "B004LWZW24", "B00AEFXT1S", "B00096S49Y", "B000LC55F2", "0783240295", "B00009L1TA", "B0034G4P30", "B002O3Z4WK", "B00005JLO8", "B001ILFUBE", "B00005JKIS", "B004SIP9MY", "6305718954", "B000ALM40I", "B0001Z52RU", "B0010X73ZG", "B000A5045Q", "B00005JMWP", "B00005JN2Z", "B000F5WR4W", "B0000648X0", "B0021L8UPS", "B00AEBBA2W", "6301971345", "B002UJIY7A", "B0006IIKQW", "B00B96TGQS", "B004BLJQOK", "B00AEFXKZ8", "6304806434", "B001NPD9LS", "B000U1ZV76", "B003L20IEW", "B00596WFE4", "B000GCFO0I", "B00005UQ9W", "B000053UIF", "B0000YTOL2"], "bought_together": ["B000TJ6PBK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000TJ6PBK", "B0012Q7M02", "B00006AUJR", "B00AEBBA2W"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 30202}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.73, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B00008EY9G", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RKTbv5kkL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Identity"}

Once a king of Manhattan, Monty is about to say good-bye to the life he knew -- a life that opened doors to New York's swankest clubs but also alienated him from the people closest to him.  In his last day on the outside, Monty tries to reconnect with his father (Brian Cox, THE BOURNE IDENTITY), and gets together with two old friends, Jacob (Philip Seymour Hoffman, ALMOST FAMOUS) and Slaughtery (Barry Pepper, THE GREEN MILE).  And then there's his girlfriend, Naturelle (Rosario Dawson, MEN IN BLACK 2), who might (or might not) have been the one who tipped off the cops.

{"description": "Uma Thurman is painful to watch inHysterical Blindness--and that's a compliment. Thurman completely gives herself over to her trashy character, a pathetically self-deluding good-time girl who hangs out in a tavern in Bayonne, New Jersey, circa 1987. She occupies the bar stool next to her best bud (a dead-on Juliette Lewis), willing herself to believe that an obviously indifferent pick-up is Mr. Right. Mira Nair (Monsoon Wedding) directed this familiar but nicely-rendered HBO production; her visual style, full of obscured sightlines and opaque glass, emphasizes the heroine's inability to see clearly. Gena Rowlands and Ben Gazzara, as Thurman's mom and her gentleman suitor, add an echo of Cassavetes realism. But it's Thurman's tour de force, capturing the kind of lost soul whose idea of first-date chat is to break an awkward silence by boasting about her best sexual skill.

{"description": "Depending on how you liked this romantic comedy, you just might find more laughs in the delightful banter between the director and his two stars on the commentary track. Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant join writer-director Marc Lawrence for a lively 102 minutes of conversation. Not much movie magic is discussed, but the three talents will sacrifice all for a good joke. It's best to watch the commentary track with the \"Two Bleeps Notice\" viewing option: when a heart appears on-screen, you can immediately view outtakes from that stage of the film. The flubs, on-set antics, and jokes are all guaranteed to bring a laugh.

{"description": "The third and final season of Seth MacFarlane's late, lamentedFamily Guyfinds television's most dysfunctional cartoon family even more animated than usual. As MacFarlane notes in a bonus segment about the controversial series' censorship battles, he was inspired to go for broke, thinking that the series, already juggled like a hot potato in the schedule (at one point, it aired opposite the mightyFriends), had been cancelled. Just asSpinal Tapwalked the fine line between \"clever and stupid,\" so didFamily Guygleefully mock the line between \"edgy and offensive.\" Case in point is this set's holy grail: \"When You Wish Upon a Weinstein,\" not aired during the series' original run, in which clueless Rhode Island patriarch Peter Griffin is convinced that if his lumpen son is to be rich and successful, he must become Jewish.LikeThe Simpsons,Family Guylends itself to multiple viewings to catch each densely packed episode's way-inside \"one-percenter\" gags (so-called by the creators because that is the percent of the audience who will get them), scattershot pop-culture references, surreal leaps, and gratuitous pot shots at everyone from, predictably, Oprah, Kevin Costner, and Bill Cosby to, unpredictably, Rita Rudner. Also like their Springfield counterparts, this series benefits from a great ensemble voice cast, with surprising contributions from a no-less-stellar roster of guest stars. Yes, that's actually Kelly Ripa as her \"real\" self, a heart-devouring alien in \"Family Guy Viewer Mail #1,\" and June Foray popping in as Rocky the Flying Squirrel in \"Brian Does Hollywood.\"Family Guy's stock has recently risen with its addition to Cartoon Network's \"Adult Swim\" lineup, a much better fit than prime time. To see Peter invite Charles Manson to a party for Sharon Tate (\"but only if you don't embarrass me\") is to marvel how much of this ever got on the air. Happily, it is on DVD.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000083C6V", "B000AQ68Z0", "B000HT3P6U", "B000RO6JZO", "B0012018OE", "B001VFM0ZG", "B003DZX46G", "B003L77G9W", "B0058YPMHO", "B00E0FW054", "B000A3DFV8", "B003V3FVQ6", "B00FR81Z40", "B000E6ES9O", "B000NNK4DM", "B002HQK5O6", "B0006B41GM", "B0040JHX0W", "B0012KSUTA", "B001RIZ7OI", "B001N9VW5Y", "B0053O8A32", "B003L77G7Y", "B003X4KHRG", "B002JVWQYG", "B003CN5B7E", "B000YOX3HE", "B00023P49C", "B002LARYTW", "B0000CABL2", "B00BYNL8DU", "B008412UQ4", "B00023P49M", "B00LFW6BA0", "B00008YGRS", "B0058RN7KA", "B008412UKA", "B0001ZWLVU", "B00LBHOCHS", "B0044E9JTG", "B000CNESM6", "B000FSME2Y", "B007KFZ85K", "B007ZFR67I", "B004696M94", "B0044E9JSW", "B0024FAR52", "B007KFZ7UQ", "B000KLQUMQ", "B007KFZ7YM", "B000ADWCYY", "B004MLEYTG", "B007KFZ88M", "B0018RKEQE", "B009SQ9Q5M", "B007KFZ7Q0", "B007KFZ87S", "B002LASCJ8", "B001L1S1PS", "B001O0TWXG", "B0018O5WUU", "B008AITJ7O", "B005QIOJUI", "B000E0OE3K", "B007KFZ7PG", "B000UZDO62", "B0006Z2L2Y", "B001L1S1PI", "B00158K0V0", "B007KFZ8B4", "B00BI5YEWG", "B007KFZ8AK", "B007KFZ8AA", "B008OTH56Q", "B000RW3VDE", "B0019CSXAM", "B006W93ELK", "B0000AQS81", "B000R7I3XC", "B0002WZRSG", "B0024FAR6Q", "B008L0YMZA", "B00005JM3G", "B000067DNE", "B000B5XOWU", "B002N5N5NE", "B00HDU9UOW", "B003KZ27N0", "B00GJPUXKC", "B000W91RUG", "B001GQ3GHG", "B0060OKO2O", "B0030Y11UG", "B0001MZ7KA", "B004XVMCH6", "B0087MN9UG", "B000HT3P7E", "B0064ESJ18", "B003L77G6U", "B000AJJNI6"], "bought_together": ["B000083C6V", "B000AQ68Z0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000083C6V", "B000HT3P6U", "B000AQ68Z0", "B003L77G9W"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 18968}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 11.97, "brand": "20TH CENTURY FOX HOME ENTMNT", "asin": "B00008YGRV", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5154SZ9QMDL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Family Guy, Vol. 2: Season 3"}

Even more shattering,  he is forced to watch in disbelief as the perpetrators are caught - and then set free.  When  his desperate pleas for help are ignored by the police and politicians, Jack comes to the  shocking realization that only one person can bring his family's killers to justice.  The  question is:  can he become that person?

He was the victim of such traumatizing bullying that it drove him to threaten to blow up the school football team. But his salvation comes in the form of drama teacher Mr. Duncan (Tom Cavanagh, TV's \"Ed\"). He offers Trevor the lead role in the school play alongside his gorgeous co-star Jenny Dahlquist. Both teacher and would-be girlfriend try to help him stay on the straight and narrow. But the play is in jeopardy: its dark plot about playground killers combined with Trevor's troubled past prompts local parents to try and get the play axed. If they succeed, Trevor may never have his voice heard--and that could be the trigger that sets off a human time bomb.

As you might expect from \"Glengarry Glen Ross\" director James Foley, this pulpy concoction is more interested in giving good actors a lot of hip, salty dialogue as they scheme their way to the royal scam. It's a poor man's \"Ocean's Eleven\", just as enjoyable in its own way, beginning when con artist Jake (Edward Burns) discovers he's accidentally stolen from an eccentric crime boss (Dustin Hoffman, oozing threat in a fine character turn). Promising to make amends by pulling the biggest con of his career, Jake adds a feisty pickpocket (Rachel Weisz) to his crew, which includes scene-stealer Paul Giammatti and Andy Garcia as a disheveled FBI agent (or is he?). With a cast like this you can't go wrong, but \"Confidence\" cons itself into thinking it's original, while Burns's abundant voice-overs state the obvious and plot twists unfold with minimal surprise. It hardly matters; \"Confidence\" may be derivative, but it's still recommendable. \"--Jeff Shannon\"", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005UQ9T", "B000H0M4BG", "B006QVRWL2", "B00DW5IL38", "B001HVZOBG", "B00004W5U6", "B002J1RZHE", "B000HRMAVS", "B0018PH3LK", "B00006G8JD", "B004TDWQSS", "B00AEBB8LA", "B0016MJ6WO", "B00005NGAG", "B00005LDDD", "B000QXDFRG", "B00005JMBQ", "B004YCKKFK", "B001J710Z2", "B00005V9HH", "B0010YVCB6", "B00009L1TA", "B000BPK2KC", "B00HOGBXS6", "B00ARVRD3E", "B00H9KKKAY", "B00GMV8M2Y", "B00012QLB4", "B00BNH9NCU", "B00IARA8KM", "B0019EXZY4", "B009AMAJPA", "B002H6NVM4", "0792833279", "B004SIP9CO", "B004SUDQ5Y", "B007CEFTSA", "B00JJ3EHCG", "B00FRILRL6", "6304698747", "B000C65Z1G", "B00004YMYZ", "B001BEK8HO", "B0011VIO3M", "B0014GI6I2", "B00014NEZI", "B00FFT19XS", "B001JIE7JC", "B004YCKJSS", "B001CIOCO4", "B003EYVXXW", "B0071HPOGK", "B0009MDPYM", "B00CC3464E", "B006ISJQ26", "B004IFYMWK", "B00A47BT7C", "B00DWZHTOU", "B001N44BVQ", "B00102F5WK", "B00080ZG10", "B004SIP6VI", "B006DHATE6", "B00005JPD0", "B005335K8G", "6305263248", "B004SIP95G", "B0016MJ6HY", "B00011CZRE", "B004IK30M8", "B00005JN2Z", "B00BEIYNRS", "B00H3JHHSE", "B0009X7BDC", "B00EL6A7PW", "B000XA5K48", "B00005JKG9", "B00DMEBXDE", "B00J5LXQX8", "B000K7UBSO", "B00J4LMJ3W", "B009AMAL4Y", "B000B8GT92", "B0034G4P30", "B0007R4SZO", "B00DVD5SBE", "B000GFLKF8", "B002ZG97O2", "B00H9KKGTO", "B000F1IQN2", "B00D3LA5WG", "B000ENC5YW", "B008JFURII", "B001U0HB5Q", "6305127646", "B002AT8K9W", "B008E70EES", "B000SM6FLI", "B0045HCJ5S", "B00007AJE1"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002J1RZHE", "B00DW5IL38", "B004TDWQSS", "B00005UQ9T"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 204847}, "asin": "B0000AGQ2E", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514C6D7T63L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Confidence"}

It's going to take some Divine intervention (Whoopi Goldberg is cast as God, no less), plus a little help from a heavenly \"Clarence.\" Despite some moments where the script seems adrift (how hard it must be to live up to the irresistible precedent set by the 1979 premierMuppet Movie) and some humor that borders on risqu&#xE9;, Fozzie and the gang are in fine form. The message is sweet: dreams are as vital to life as loyal friendships are to see them through.

{"description": "Both epic and heartbreakingly intimate,Nowhere in Africabegins  with a Jewish woman named Jettel Redlich fleeing Nazi Germany with her  daughter Regina, to join her husband, Walter, on a farm in Kenya. At  first, Jettel refuses to adjust to her new circumstances (she brought  with her a set of china dishes and an evening gown), while Regina adapts  readily to this new world, forming a strong bond with her father's cook,  an African named Owuor. But this is only the beginning of a series of  uprootings, and as the surface of their lives is torn away, Walter and  Jettel find they have little in common, and must--under tumultuous  circumstances--build their marriage anew.

Alex Gromberg (Michael) is a high-powered lawyer who works for a firm co-founded by his father Mitchell (Kirk), who's recovering from a stroke, while Alex's son Asher (Cameron) is dealing pot and flunking out of his senior year in college.

{"description": "Harrison Ford lends his solid, perpetually disgruntled presence toHollywood Homicide, an action comedy in which he's paired with the squinty eyes and peaches-and-cream complexion of Josh Hartnett (Black Hawk Down,O). Radical French filmmaker Jean-Luc Godard would appreciate this complete deconstruction of the buddy-cop flick genre; basic cinematic elements (mismatched partners, a hard-ass superior riding them, arguments about who's going to drive, arguments about intuition vs. diligent detective work, the bad cop who killed Hartnett's father, etc.) have been scrambled and slapped together with no concern for coherence, making clear their innately artificial nature. Sex scenes and car chases come out of nowhere and disappear without consequence, providing arbitrary visual stimulus. During shootouts, it's impossible to tell who got killed or why, underscoring a basic doubt about the purpose of making movies likeHollywood Homicide.

{"description": "People use the word \"sleeper\" loosely, butA Wedding for Bella(released to theaters asThe Bread, My Sweet) truly fits the bill. This tiny-budgeted charmer had modest distribution, but managed to win over the audiences that stumbled across it. In order to please his beloved elders, an Italian-American (Scott Baio) plots to marry a woman (Kristin Minter) he doesn't even know, with much of the action set around the homey ethnic bakery he owns in Pittsburgh. Yes, it's all veryMoonstruck, but without the star power or the glossy finish; in fact, the production values (and some of the acting) in this film are variable to the point of clumsy. But there's a warm, intimate mood here that's inextricable from the homemade style. And, in an image-changing turn, former kid star Scott Baio delivers a terrific, assured performance. It's the biggest surprise in a sweet movie.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000JU8H9C", "B00HRUQ8HK", "B008N25XAE", "B00DCG36LO", "B00EOHGQPI", "B00DCG3696", "B00ANV82HE", "B00GST8LMG", "B00LG7VVPO", "B006GL8MQQ", "B003YOZNGK", "B00HW3EZZE", "B00FKPHPW6", "B001C0NMWK", "B00E0KWBE4", "B00006HAYQ", "B007K7IAVC", "B00GV8AZI2", "B009INAC12", "B0099116S6", "B009YKFH6E", "B0077PBPTG", "B009INAK8C", "B00FOLGW48", "B009DQ6N9O", "B00DW5ILUG", "B00CAYH23M", "B001L2ZSFI", "B00BEIYGK2", "B00F9IMX6W", "B00DNF1S28", "B00KDK64DY", "B00DW7IV5O", "B0026RX2VE", "B008IG0D00", "B00A4Y60P6", "B008EFDC6M", "B00E6PUYJW", "B00BNAE6M4", "B001C0NMWU", "B008K1PY5M", "B00IYRLUAU", "B0032LV4NG", "B00F9IMX8U", "B00J92616W", "B000EHRVOW", "B0091D48KK", "B002CLKOXS", "B00A4Y61ZU", "B000A3XYIM", "B00GO6W82M", "B005FWO35Q", "B004R67RC2", "B000FUTVV4", "B00C4BDG7M", "B00GLPYVQC", "B0012KSUT0", "B00F9IMXBC", "B00FZ4KR4U", "B00150N8EY", "B00AIBBVMW", "B008U1ANHG", "B00DNF1RM4", "B0039ZBM3W", "B007K7IBTI", "B0010AN7XQ", "B005F3XV4Y", "B00DNF1RDI", "B000WMA6F0", "B001BAWKQU", "B0036K9CIM", "B008R5SZZM", "B005YCEIIE", "B005K1VPY4", "B008MQ6PIA", "B004IN75DU", "B003H8F5SY", "B00F0ORGB2", "B008R5SZY8", "B00AS1Q93S", "B000067J1O", "B005GP7EUI", "B008IG0DJQ", "B003X2P9AS", "B005N4DNDY", "B0000ZMGZW", "B00AEJM5Z0", "156371616X", "B004SIP9VA", "B009INAL0E", "0783226772", "B00006ZXSO", "B0035JHYNO", "B00EPA3UVW", "B000P5FH26", "B002LVGXHK", "B00GSTHC7G", "B008IG0FT4", "B0087XNTO6", "B000PKG8XI"], "bought_together": ["B000JU8H9C", "B000EHRVOW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000C8STWG", "B002ZG988M", "B005YCEIIE", "B008N25XAE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 195716}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 18.5, "brand": "Gaiam Americas", "asin": "B00011V8HW", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HMN75K79L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "A Wedding for Bella (aka The Bread, My Sweet)"}

{"description": "Like the movie, the DVD extras are smarter and a lot more entertaining than your average flick. The making-of feature (\"Lessons Learned\") has the usual behind-the-scenes banter but Jack Black is in fine form--that is, something special--interviewing as much as being interviewed about the making of the film. His unique pitch to Led Zeppelin to use their song is alone worth the price of the DVD. Black is more his maniacal self and a bit more grating in MTV's Diary segment, but his commentary track with director Richard Linklater is as insightful as it is funny. Ok, it's a lot more funny, but entertaining throughout. The commentary track featuring just the kid actors is less so, but any preteen would love listening to it. To top it off, the DVD-ROM has Dewey Finn's instantly famous blackboard history of rock. You can drill down to the bands mentioned and get a brief history of each.

{"description": "This two-disc set certainly improves upon the fluffyReloadedDVD release. Although there's still no Wachowski brothers talking about their creation, there's a lot of good stuff here in the three main segments. We are constantly reminded how long the back-to-back filming schedule was, and it's most interesting to hear from the actors and artists as they come to the end of this long road. When a white rabbit flashes on screen, you can \"branch\" the most interesting documentary footage: how \"bullet time\" is being recalibrated and how you go about replicating so many Agent Smiths.

{"description": "No actor works harder to open a movie than Tom Cruise. His enthusiasm is throughout the DVD extras as he mirrors his samurai character by constantly talking about \"loyalty\" and \"discipline\" while working on the film. However as a post-movie experience, the top-line extras with Cruise and director Edward Zwick are repetitive and underwhelming, with too many clips from the film we assume DVD viewers have just seen. The History Channel show is also a pre-release promotional device that misses an opportunity to really dig into this intriguing time period. Better are segments on the costumes, the production design, and how you put together an Imperial army--in New Zealand, no less. Zwick's low-key and dense commentary (plus a \"Video Journal\") is not vital, but he illustrates many of the little peculiarities it took to make the wide-ranging film come together. There are two deleted scenes; a samurai's first appearance is particularly memorable.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEFY5B6", "B002O3Z50Q", "B00004XPPG", "B00AMSLDTM", "B0002YLCG0", "B0000DZTIW", "B000AARKOO", "B000QXDED6", "B003U0AHBO", "B00AEFXKUI", "B000A2WP7O", "B008MIMWOY", "B00AEBBA36", "B004AOECXI", "6305692688", "B000MGB6NM", "B0000TANUI", "079283366X", "B00005JL78", "B000W1SZBS", "B004SIP88Y", "B0034G4P58", "B001TUZG4K", "B00AS1Q93S", "B000MRA592", "B00001ZWUS", "B000E5N6LG", "B000XR9L50", "B0001HLVS2", "B00HEPDGKA", "B003ASLJO0", "B00AEBB9NM", "B000P0J0EW", "B0000A2ZNX", "B00005JNTI", "B0018QPPXW", "B000065U1N", "B000095WW8", "B0002WZTOI", "B002VWNIEA", "B004U7MQWY", "B002VWNID6", "B008JFUO36", "B00AEBB86A", "B00005JN0W", "B0007Q6VXC", "B001LRJH0U", "B000MZHW40", "B0002IQMAM", "B00004WG2F", "B003INBO3I", "B000EHRVMY", "B000NOKFHQ", "B000P0J0EM", "B00AEFXVCU", "B000YENUI6", "B000M341QE", "B0000YEEGM", "B001680M26", "B008R65XYC", "B002ZG99QS", "B00008K76U", "B000HRMAPE", "B007TBKAXK", "B00000G3PA", "0767810856", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B00AEFXYJA", "B002T9H2LA", "B000P0J0AG", "B00003CXZ1", "B000O599YO", "B000FS9FCG", "6304711905", "B00AEFXRRO", "B000HRMAUY", "B001ILHY1I", "B002NZK5V4", "B002VWNICC", "B000VKL6ZM", "B001UDS4BS", "B002ZG997C", "B004SIP8ZM", "0800177967", "B0001O3YD0", "B00005ATZT", "B004XFZ3UU", "B00004Z4WR", "B005LAIH2W", "B0007TKNGA", "B00000JQB5", "B0012Q732O", "B002ZG97RE", "B0002VEUV2", "0800141741", "B002ZG977Y", "B00005N5S3", "B00008G8M4", "B0000B1OFL"], "bought_together": ["B00AEFY5B6", "B00004XPPG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000QXDED6", "B00BEJL6JK", "B00AEFXXMI", "B00JU949TK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 121880}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 17.25, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B0001JXOUS", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51EdSWs9r9L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Last Samurai (Full Screen Edition)"}
{"description": "Taking a page fromThe Animatrix,Dark Furyis part of a new trend of bridging theatrical sequels. As an official product of a franchise, the 35-minute anime benefits from having the original actors voice the characters, including Vin Diesel as Riddick. This story opens with the new action hero and the two other survivors ofPitch Blackalready caught by a giant spaceship filled with dread. The sinewy leader has a unique--and creepy--jail for master villains and she has her sights set on Riddick. The film--indeed the series--is indebted to animator Peter Chung, who brings his techno style from hisAeon Fluxseries. His smooth animation for Riddick doesn't reinvent the character as much as give him a new, appealing fluidity. As anime goes, there's nothing really new here--plenty of action, cool killers, and dramatic spurts of blood--but it's a building block for how this genre might enliven movie series and sequels in the future.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0001O3YD0", "B0002VEUV2", "B001RTCP10", "B001RTCP1A", "B00A2H9OZS", "B00A2H9OSK", "B004GSVX5S", "0345468392", "B0001CNRNY", "B001KMB6X2", "B000WCN8QO", "B00JM58C22", "B00009ZPUA", "0312935099", "B0090SI582", "B001L1AJ80", "B00BEJL6JK", "B00K7IPGS6", "B00JL6L4WC", "B00HWWUQYY", "B001KMB6VE", "B008JFUNHI", "B00HERGM86", "B008JFUO36", "B00HEPDLFK", "B000CNER1S", "B00GDDNMEY", "B00CTSDDVO", "B000NY0YJK", "B008JFUR10", "B000KJTFEI", "B00GDDNFDW", "B00BEIYH6U", "0790745356", "B00007LB4C", "B00JL6L4UY", "B008JFUS0U", "B0088X7YMS", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B00H83EV5W", "B00BEJL6Q8", "B000OYCMNU", "B00FF9SKSK", "B003YOZNBK", "B008JFUS8M", "B00IKM5LXG", "B004RBC5S8", "B00D7OMNXS", "B00FRILRRK", "B00GZ0ML4C", "078401132X", "B000FFJ826", "B008JFUQZ2", "B00AZMFJYA", "B008JFUN50", "B00D2ZF3GQ", "B009MO57H6", "B008JFUNJQ", "B00008LDPU", "B005TK0WG8", "B00J11U54K", "B00DYEN6XC", "B00E8S2JZ4", "B0090SI56Y", "B005LAII44", "B008JFUN6E", "B00BFCJKMG", "B00005JKYX", "B00HEPDGKA", "B00C28J2VQ", "B00JPS6A3O", "B004LWZW4C", "B005LAII80", "B001B1878E", "B005LAIIN0", "B008JFUO4U", "B00AIBZL14", "B00CAAU39G", "B001L18RIE", "B0010TDRP0", "B00G3HOJZ6", "B00A3718IS", "B002U6CJO2", "B0018CWWA0", "B001K2KM8C", "B000067FP2", "B005FT2MJ8", "B009R68H80", "B002XJDUVM", "B0010358CQ", "B002QW7AJY", "B00F40UBM8", "B000AMJG4Y", "B000EZ7ZZO", "B003Z8ZC1G", "B00CHMBQNE", "B0012018OE", "B00005B8UD", "B0007OY31G"], "bought_together": ["B0001O3YD0", "B0002VEUV2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00A2H9OSK", "B0001O3YD0", "B0002VEUV2", "B00CWX1HNW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 77034}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.64, "brand": "Universal Studios", "asin": "B0001O3YA8", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51KKKW101GL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Dark Fury - The Chronicles of Riddick (Animated)"}
{"description": "In 1991, a small Medieval prayer book was sold at auction. Miraculously, some original writings of Archimedes, the brilliant Greek mathematician, were discovered hidden beneath the religious text. Through scholarly detective work with the help of modern technology, this book now reveals Archimedes&#x92; stunningly original concepts, ideas, and theories&#x97;revelations that, if known sooner, might have reshaped our world.Many historic figures have been hailed as ahead of their time. Few&#x97;if any&#x97;are said to be centuries ahead of their time. The Einstein of his era, Archimedes had a sophisticated understanding of mathematics, and designed marvelous war machines for his native Syracuse to use against the invading Romans. Many of Archimedes&#x92; works disappeared during the Middle Ages, but some survived to help inspire the scientific revolution in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. One document that seemed irretrievably lost was his final treatise The Method, which reputedly explained how he achieved his brilliant results&#x97;secrets he revealed nowhere else. Now, over 2200 years later, the discovery of The Method has experts and scientists dreaming of what might have been if Renaissance thinkers and other great minds had known of his ideas and been able to build on them.NOVA explores Archimedes&#x92; rare writings, as well as the book&#x92;s mysterious beginnings, tumultuous history and amazing discovery. As the ancient text comes back from the dead, it unlocks its revolutionary contents&#x97;the infinite secrets of one of history&#x92;s greatest thinkers.Special DVD features include: activities for educators; materials and activities for librarians; a link to the Infinite Secrets Web site; scene selections; closed captions;  and described video for the visually impaired.On one DVD5 disc.

{"description": "Combining the immediacy of Italian neorealism with potent criticism of post-war Italian society,Mamma Romais one of Pier Paolo Pasolini's most accessible and satisfying films. This was only his second feature, but Pasolini (who was mysteriously murdered in 1975) was already demonstrating a powerful affinity for cinema as a forum for his anti-Fascist ideology. To express his outrage at the spiritual vacancy of vulgar consumerism, Pasolini cast the great Anna Magnani in the title role, a former prostitute struggling to transcend her sordid past in a desperate attempt to give her estranged teenage son the better life she never had. In Pasolini's worldview, Mamma'spetit bourgeoisidealism can only be doomed, and the film assumes the melodramatic thrust of tragic opera. Like most of Pasolini's films,Mamma Romaattracted controversy, but it was nothing compared to the outcry over \"La ricotta,\" a 35-minute short featuring Orson Welles (part of the 1963 anthology filmRoGoPaG, and included here for the first time on DVD). Seized and condemned \"for insulting the religion of the state,\" \"La ricotta\" presents the crucifixion of Christ as an incendiary criticism of the Catholic Church, in which the actor playing Jesus stuffs himself with ricotta cheese and dies from indigestion on the cross!As usual, Criterion has done an exemplary job of assembling a wealth of supplementary materials. Pasolini's films demand at least rudimentary understanding of his life and politics, and that background is provided through new interviews with former collaborators, a clip-laden 1995 documentary about Pasolini's career, and a 32-page booklet containing excerpts of interviews from the out-of-print bookPasolini on Pasolini, along with a mini-essay onMamma Romathat further illuminates the film in the context of Pasolini's controversial career. For anyone interested in Pasolini's art, this two-disc set provides a suitable starting point, offering important films and scholarly study in the esteemed Criterion tradition.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004PR7XQI", "B00008G96Z", "B00009Y3PG", "B008Y5OXB0", "B002U6DVQ2", "6305081034", "B005MTHRAA", "B001LMU1C8", "B00000IOKV", "B00009ME9Z", "B00HRJVHEK", "B0007989Y8", "B00005JKGO", "B00F98FOFY", "B000093NR0", "B00005BHW6", "B006MHZ32K", "B004ODLUIU", "B0009HLCTC", "B00DZP1BUU", "B003VA3JTK", "B000FUF7D0", "B00005BCJZ", "B00DHN8GGW", "B008Y5OWKW", "B0002DB4YQ", "B00GPPXOTS", "B004ODLUGW", "B006H3KQP8", "B0007M222A", "B00009Y3PM", "B009VO9XSG", "B000G8NXYQ", "B001BSBBIU", "B004M66YUS", "B0000CDUT5", "B000BC8SWO", "B0006Z2NB8", "B000093NR1", "B00005A8TU", "B004W48U98", "B00DZP1C3Q", "B00014K5ZU", "B00005QAPH", "B00HE010QM", "B00008DDUF", "B0043CT9E4", "B000093NR2", "B0002ERX1I", "B002JTMNZ0", "B00B2BYXWM", "B001LMU19G", "0780023099", "B005MTHRCI", "0780022270", "B00005QAPJ", "B00CEIOH8C", "6305999872", "B008CJ0JS4", "B000PKG6OY", "B0000A02TX", "B000CR8QV6", "B00B2BYXSQ", "B000KRNGNQ", "B00005V6N6", "B0000687DE", "B00598OA2C", "B00005JKFX", "B0012KOM6K", "B001BEK8C4", "B005D0RDCU", "B006X96PE2", "B003D3Y64C", "B00007CVS2", "B0002HMKG8", "B006MHZ46A", "B0007SMDCS", "B001CW7ZSU", "B0000633SD", "B001D8W7EK", "B000IHYXH6", "B00A8QDHYW", "B0035ECI12", "B007USWCR4", "B005VU9LP4", "B00HVOFP08", "B0000C23T0", "B006X96PBU", "B0001V6ZIY", "B000C8Q900", "0780022343", "B0000BWVCR", "B009GIGY3E", "B001D8W7EU", "0780022823", "B00B2BYY1M", "B00I116MZ2", "B003WKL6YE"], "bought_together": ["B00008G96Z", "B00009Y3PG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005MTHRAA", "B00014K5ZU", "B004M66YUS", "B001BSBBIU"]}, "price": 32.98, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 78089}, "asin": "B0001ZIVAA", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HjVEnc38L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Mamma Roma (The Criterion Collection)"}

{"description": "Warner Brothers'Batman: The Animated Series(1992-1995) remains a striking, stylized program that helped to revitalize the familiar comic book hero. Drawing on such diverse influences as Frank Miller's graphic novelThe Dark Knight Returns, the Fleischers'Supermancartoons of the early '40s, and contemporary Japanese animation, the filmmakers stress interesting designs and  cinematography. The Caped Crusader prowls a sinister, Art Deco-styled world of tall verticals, sharp angles, silhouettes, searchlights, and grid-like shadows cast by window frames. Its visual pizzazz  eclipses Filmation's pallid kidvid,The Batman/Superman Hour(CBS, 1968), which ran off and on in various incarnations through 1981. Many of the same artists worked on the Batman animated features (e.g.,Mask of the Phantasm(1993),Batman Beyond--The Movie(1999)), which display similar strengths and weaknesses.Ironically,Batman: The Animated Serieslooks better in stills than it does in motion. The artists fail to stylize the movements of the characters to match the dramatic settings, as Genndy Tartakovsky and his crew did inSamurai Jack. Batman uses sophisticated computers to combat the well-known villains--the Joker, the Penguin, Mr. Freeze, Catwoman--as well as some less celebrated baddies: Manbat, Clayface, The Mad Hatter. The bad guys cram a lot of plotting and scheming into each 22-minute episode, but the violence is kept to a broadcast standards minimum.The Dark Knight's First Knighteasily ranks as the most interesting of the extras. Producers Bruce Timm and Eric Radomski recount the genesis of the series, and show their mini-pilot, which is more violent and more fully animated. If the complete episodes had matched the pilot, the series would have been much more exciting.

{"description": "An uncommonly powerful film,Broken Wingscaptures a family in  mid-disintegration: A midwife at an Israeli hospital struggles to hold her  children together in the wake of their father's death. Maya, a gaunt, pale  young woman, aspires to win a band contest; Ido, a boy bullied at school,  tries to film himself jumping from heights; Yair, a teenage boy, wallows  in the meaninglessness of existence as he hands out flyers, dressed in a  mouse costume. This may sound tedious or excruciating, but it's given  vivid life by an incredible cast and a humor that manages to be absurd and  a little sad at the same time. The movie embraces its characters with a  profound empathy; it's hard to imagine that anyone could watchBroken  Wingsand not be deeply moved by the end. Not surprisingly, the movie  has won numerous awards at film festivals around the world.--Bret  Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000OCY7KS", "B00772HQTC", "B0009YVBGO", "B0013HL6ES", "B00AZMFM3I", "B0000694XO", "B002MQM4FO", "B00CNIDH70", "B00ATK0452", "B001KVZ6AM", "B002M36R50", "B000E8QVAQ", "B009V0LRJI", "B00DJYJOPG", "B00IHBSANI", "B000EHQ7JC", "B0046AKAY6", "B000YMDJ02", "B005J47QQ8", "B00FL2EWYM", "B00AADAEH6", "B001BGTWTM", "B000E0OE44", "B00265T7JC", "B00008H2NK", "B000LW7P2I", "0062282697", "B005PYEQH4", "B000BLBZFW", "B00000IGV4", "B00E849QSG", "B002U4F5W2", "B000HEZEUU", "B003MT2EHS", "B00008HC96", "B00EVU3RGE", "B000OT6V5U", "B004GIJ2AQ", "B00A6HHJNS", "1741791383", "B00116VG3M", "B0006A9GCM", "B0001KNHAO", "B000EWBKYO", "B0036TGTDE", "B00BVJJSMA", "162022027X", "B002T921C0", "B000T5O48A", "B001E2PQGG", "9653070274", "B003JLL2RW", "B005KML1FG", "B0000541TP", "B001HYC4HA", "B00007JZV7", "B001DJ9PS0", "B004GFE33U", "B00003CYBS", "B008GWJJ42", "B005KMBXLS", "B006G1QDR6", "B00007JZV8", "1400049598", "B00B2TURYC", "B0002Z8CJO"], "bought_together": ["B000OCY7KS", "B0013HL6ES"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0009YVBGO", "B00DJYJOPG", "B0000694XO", "B00AZMFM3I"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 212344}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.95, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B000255L98", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51B0K1W6YHL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Broken Wings"}
{"description": "What's scarier than scary kids?Village of the Damnedis the definitive scary-kid classic, a truly unsettling film drawn from John Wyndham's novelThe Midwich Cuckoos. The brilliant opening sequence depicts the sudden and temporary paralysis of a small English hamlet, which is followed by the town's women becoming mysteriously pregnant. The spawn of this occurrence are a dozen eerie, blond-headed children, who are either gifted, evil, or \"the world's new people.\" A splendid outing, not least in the way it catches parental anxiety about this small new stranger in one's home. (It was remade by John Carpenter in 1995.)Children of the Damnedfollows up with a story about six more creepy kids, brought from all over the globe to huddle in a old church in London. An excellent opening half-hour gets bogged down in the movie's global-political ambitions (it's very much a cold war offering), but it has its share of shivery moments--the sight of the six youngsters striding down a London street as though they controlled the world is a chiller. But where's the blond hair? The two films are different in tone;Villagefeels like a fifties sci-fi offering, with an old-school star (George Sanders) and classical style;Childrenis a film of the sixties, with hipper techniques, urban setting, and young actors Ian Hendry and Alan Badel. But both have those damned kids.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783230427", "B000A0GOF0", "B00027JYNK", "B0009X75EC", "B000063UR0", "B007Y1NNAW", "B00LU4URS0", "B0000694WH", "B00005R1O7", "B000AYELJ2", "B00009NHC0", "B0007R4T26", "B005HIBWBG", "B002945DUW", "B000RXVNDI", "B00AEBB8VK", "B00518A70E", "B000UDGOBG", "6305869367", "B0045HCJJE", "B00D9EJFV4", "B00LC4PEZ4", "B00D9EJFZA", "B000G6BLYM", "B001B9ZVVC", "B00005JKFR", "B00000K3U3", "B00005LIRD", "0783116926", "B000EHSVJG", "B00005NSXY", "B000UAFDR0", "B00K6D1S7A", "B000FOPPEC", "B000A0GOEQ", "B000A0GOFA", "B00DZP1C9K", "B000OHZJGO", "B005ETANC2", "B000068TPG", "0991127900", "B000AQKU72", "6305761078", "B0045HCJSA", "B0048O2YWG", "B00DOZNGC2", "B0034PWPHY", "B000C20VNM", "B00KSPST6Y", "B00023P4TM", "B000HT38B2", "B0009X770E", "B00009PY4D", "B000FFJZO2", "B00KIZY0EE", "B00K2CHVSK", "B0000694WM", "B0009X770O", "B000S0GYBG", "B000FVQLKW", "B0013XZ6SY", "B00AEBB94G", "B00009NHBC", "B004X63SCY", "B00KIZYDCI", "B00B94VJYW", "B000062XEY", "B0053TWVDC", "B001BSBBNK", "6305944288", "B00009PY2T", "B001BSBBGC", "B005D0RDKM", "B000BYA5IC", "B00003CXCF", "B000RXVNCO", "B000OHBCI8", "B00009PY4A", "B00009PY38", "B00006SFIT", "B00023P4UQ", "B00027JYLC", "B002TSAAS8", "B00DSAUJ32", "B00465I1BK", "B00005Y6XR", "B00005R1O8", "B00IYJFB2G", "B0045HCJKS", "B0002IQL8K", "B005GPFZEK", "B000TLTCT0", "B000EHSVJ6", "B000HEWEDK", "B00ITZXDDY", "B0000A9GHP", "6305772681", "B00006CXGP", "6305772142", "B0009PLLMC"], "bought_together": ["0783230427"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0783230427", "B00027JYNK", "B0009X75EC", "B000063UR0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 29525}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.05, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00027JYMG", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51SknyPjhrL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Village of the Damned/Children of the Damned"}

{"description": "TheBabylon 5pilot movieThe Gatheringwas originally broadcast in 1993 a full year ahead of the regular show. A somewhat dull tale of an attempt to assassinate Koch, the Vorlon ambassador toB5, the feature served to introduce Commander Jeffery Sinclair (Michael O'Hare) and Security Chief Michael Garibaldi (Jerry Doyle) as well as familiarize the audience with the unique environment of a five-mile-long space station in the year 2257. Missing many of the main cast, and suffering from a leaden pace and mediocre music score, series creator J Michael Straczynski later improvedThe Gatheringby tightening the cut for a special edition (the version released on DVD), adding some deleted character moments and commissioning a new score from series composer Christopher Franke.Four new TV movies were part of the deal to syndicateBabylon 5.In the Beginningis a prelude set 10 years beforeBabylon 5, telling the story of the Earth-Minbari war. Told retrospectively, many of the mysteries revealed gradually in the main series are recounted, making the show a collection of spoilers for newcomers while adding little for established fans. It is effective to see events only previously talked about, and enjoyable to have most of the main cast playing younger versions of themselves.River of Soulsis a self-contained adventure featuring a return of the Soul Hunters from Season One, whileThirdspaceoffers a spectacular Lovecraftian space opera which slots into the saga after the end of the Shadow War.A Call to Armsis the most important of the TV films, laying the ground for the future TV seriesCrusade. Set five years after the Shadow War, it tells the story of a Drahk revenge attack on Earth. A final showcase for Bruce Boxleitner as Sheridan, the story fits between fifth-season episodes \"Objects at Rest\" and \"Sleeping in Light.\" The cliffhanger ending sets the scene for new starshipExcaliburto boldly go on a five-year mission to explore strange new worlds and find a cure for the Shadow virus infecting the Earth.--Gary S.

Still, the gags come fast and furious, so for there's undoubtedly something to laugh at amidst the bathroom and ethnic jibes.--Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00006HAYO", "B000063RQO", "B000071ZZJ", "B00007ELEO", "B004P7CMZ0", "6304821832", "B00005LB86", "B00E1HIXA2", "B00003CY51", "B0000AGQ6T", "6305505780", "B00177YFYM", "B000UNYJWM", "630592273X", "B0002B14UW", "B00005UQ9I", "B00AEFYE08", "B000069DOB", "B002GHHK3U", "B00BLN4V46", "B00BTYPWDQ", "B00AEBB9AA", "B00000JGHV", "B0001Q4BOE", "B00003GPFT", "B000FS9ULC", "B001DJLD12", "B00008WI9O", "B00003W8NT", "B002CA68N4", "B000NA21SG", "B0034G4P1C", "B002C7ELWC", "B00007BK2T", "B00HX0KIAM", "B00004TJMW", "0780627822", "B00066FAQW", "B000274T94", "B00AEFYQWO", "B0002VYOVI", "1558908390", "B00005RIX5", "B0000TWMTS", "B000HDZKLO", "B001KKU9DM", "0780631234", "B0000TWMWK", "155890834X", "B00005JLG1", "0783237367", "B00J11U57C", "B000JBXHQY", "B000F4RH84", "B00H47IX5G", "B00EC6VVXI", "B00006LPH6", "6305120013", "B00005JLQT", "B005LAIH86", "0767813901", "B000060MWA", "B00005JPK8", "B00005JK8N", "B000056BOW", "B00BEL4QFO", "B000069HQ2", "B0000JBUHI", "B00007ELEN", "0783240201", "B00AEFXP8K", "B001DJLCQS", "B002ZG99RW", "B00068WOH8", "B002CA68NO", "B005SHBO1Y", "B0009X7BFK", "B0009K7RMA", "B000035Z3G", "B00AEFYAC0", "B0010NXURQ", "B00005JH9O", "B000BITV9W", "B0001FR3HW", "B00BLN4V5A", "B004SIP93S", "B00E1HIX66", "B002GSXKO2", "0767821955", "B000056N8Q", "B000TLOMPE", "B00008977B", "0783230524", "B002CAWNEM", "B000051YMS", "B0009P42RS", "B000BTITFI", "B007VYEE0A", "B00GOZ2LPM", "B002FOFX9M"], "bought_together": ["B00006HAYO", "B000063RQO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000063RQO", "B00006HAYO", "B000071ZZJ", "1558908390"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 33996}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.5, "brand": "Arnold", "asin": "B0002J4YVK", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51TFP9D4WCL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Soul Plane (Unrated Mile High Edition)"}
{"description": "Declared \"luminously beautiful\" by the New York Times, Andrey Zvyagintsev's The Return is a stunning mixture of visionary allegory, urgent suspense and road movie momentum. Zvyagintsev's equal skill with lush visuals, lucid storytelling and breathtaking realism easily netted The Return the prestigious Golden Lion and the Best First Feature Film Award at the Venice International Film Festival.  Within the emotional vacuum of a fatherless childhood, young brothers Andrei (Vladimir Garin) and Ivan (Ivan Dobronravov) have grown closer than most siblings. But when they least expect it, the father the boys have never known returns. Under the cool midnight sun of a coastal Russian summer, Andrei and Ivan eagerly hop into a car for a week long fishing trip with a complete stranger they desperately need to believe is their father. but as they travel deeper into the Russian wilderness, their journey devolves from vacation to boot camp to father-sons love triangle and ultimately to a test of wills that pushes to the brink of violence. As it dawns on the boys that the man who could be their father might be trying to abandon, exploit or kill them, The Return's Jungian landscape gives way to fervid Freudian rage, shocking loss and bittersweet redemption.  Harried as one of the most auspicious film debuts since Badlands or The 400 Blows, The Return is both a gorgeous contemporary thriller and an astute updating of vanguard Soviet filmmaking. Disturbing, tender, transcendent, The Return's skillful marriage of psychological complexity to mythic imagery effortlessly evokes the watershed films of Andrei Tarkovsky and Roman Polanski.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000K2UEDG", "B00280QNK6", "B00019G4TQ", "B000RTCSIQ", "B000LTTOOS", "B004XVMCLC", "B0000633SD", "B00008ZZ9M", "B00006LPEK", "B0022RVO18", "B008MZTKFG", "B003OXGW5M", "B0000DGKI7", "B00009MEKP", "B000LV6OHQ", "B003VWR1XI", "B00003CXF4", "B0000633SB", "B00006JO77", "B000NQRDZG", "B00005QFE6", "6305257450", "B002BWP4A6", "B000I8OOG0", "6305744114", "B0000BWVCR", "B002QP145C", "B001MPS7GG", "B001PCNZEU", "B000B58DIA", "B0087OULO6", "B003MTAZCO", "B00HVOFP6W", "B006ML50YC", "B006IW8E3Y", "B004VH65A2", "B00009NHAT", "B000WS6YAA", "B0000ALPJ2", "B001UE49BQ", "B000EANSXM", "B00GMV8B1G", "B001H30Q08", "B000OVLBGC", "B00H0EN948", "B0001LJCAW", "B00019G4RS", "B000TGCR38", "B00006LPEH", "B001QOZYRS", "B000I8OOHE", "B000OCY7JE", "B0000C2IQA", "B000K7VHQO", "B00HRJVHEK", "B000PKG6OO", "B00151QYE4", "B0036TGSJE", "B002U4F5W2", "B00GA9F2PI", "B007FEHA0C", "B00IGK6TH4", "B0016K3988", "B000V7HFL4", "B00023P4N8", "B00AXYZZ6C", "B0002DB52M", "6305131104", "B00006LPER", "B00031TYGW", "B000EHQU30", "B009XTF8NI", "B000FZEU0G", "B0000YEDM2", "B001CW7ZT4", "B009CSVQ8Q", "B006ML50S8", "B0048FQFFM", "B0019T0JAW", "B004SIP6GI", "B00GPPXNLC", "B004GNBBVO", "B00EO2I6S8", "5489003219", "B000A5044C", "B00A8QDI1Y", "B00005N8A9", "B00H91LWBY", "B0000714AW", "B00065GX0K", "6305899681", "B005LAIIIK", "B000BC8SWE", "B00000F3CD", "B002U1LGSW", "B0000DJYNI", "B000G0O5IM", "B00005JLQW", "B000BMY2NS", "B004G8QO7U"], "bought_together": ["B00280QNK6", "B000K2UEDG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000RTCSIQ", "B000K2UEDG", "B000LTTOOS", "B00280QNK6"]}, "price": 18.46, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 82114}, "asin": "B0002KQOH6", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51BBQQ48J2L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Return"}
{"description": "Billionaire Howard Hughes produced and directed Hell's Angels, the most expensive film ever made in its time. Hughes spared no expense in capturing an exciting dogfight between R.A.F. and German fighter planes, using 137 pilots in all. Hell's Angels is perhaps more notable for introducing Jean Harlow to the screen in her first major film role.  Set during World War I, Hell's Angels is the story of three Oxford buddies: two brothers (Ben Lyon and James Hall) and one German (John Darrow). When all three are conscripted to fight on opposing sides of the war, each is torn between obedience to his country and that of his conscience. Jean Harlow is the woman who comes between the three men in this lavish period adventure.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000M2E30O", "B001BSBBHG", "B00AEFZDNA", "B00008AOTN", "B000784WRW", "B00AEBB9QY", "B000N3T0H8", "B003L16F7C", "B0039USJBA", "B00B7U2GCC", "B0006HBLIW", "B00D9BNONW", "B000054OU3", "B00014NEX0", "B009RNK10K", "B000LAZE8C", "B0047BXR1C", "B00005B1YH", "B000P6R5PM", "B000KGGJ0Y", "B005ZVILV4", "B0000CBL7Z", "B00080ZG10", "B0006HBV2S", "B000FTCLR6", "B000I2JDF8", "B005VPNJ2A", "B000YRY7VC", "B000O78L0U", "B00D23GPH4", "B001QFFBAM", "B0001NBMHQ", "B00652FG24", "B00JWS9J1M", "B00LC4PFVW", "B000E6ESWG", "B005OFM1I0", "B009RNK0WY", "B000H1RFSM", "B00J2TE3DU", "0306813920", "B0018BYNY4", "B005SQ3AO4", "B00D9BNOKK", "0792841409", "B00BTYJYR6", "B000E6ESXK", "0780020707", "B0009S4IKG", "B003UN2IAY", "B000KX0HIC", "B000MTFFRW", "B00005B1YF", "B000F7CMXQ", "B00005R23T", "B004RE29RC", "B000244EWY", "B003L2BZ0I", "B00CVB6XZM", "B000E5N6KW", "B000E8JO32", "B00005U8F4", "B0006Z2KXO", "B0009S4IIS", "B0082LUEFA", "B002NHX1YK", "B00KIZY3XW", "B00008AOTO", "B00006LPC4", "B00319ECI8", "B000VZGK3K", "B005HQBO9S", "B0002V8OAK", "B00064AF64", "B00008R9M6", "B000NTPG6Q", "B004R6JG7Q", "B007FQXEQO", "B0036FJ6OM", "B002GHHHPQ", "B003IPD984", "B003ZW9H68", "B00004Y7D0", "B008A1TXMM", "0782011276", "0753824078", "B006FE83T0", "B001SVEXSK", "B000QGE8J2", "B000TGKWPS", "B0012GVMI0", "0393326020", "B00008R9M5", "B002E7GCMC", "B000NTPG5M", "B000EHQTZO", "0857060694", "B000NO1XJA", "B0011FDVGI", "B000O599N0"], "bought_together": ["B000M2E30O", "B00AEFZDNA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AEFZDNA", "B00D9BNONW", "B000KGGJ0Y", "B00005U8F4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 9680}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.5, "brand": "UNIVERSAL", "asin": "B0002MHE1O", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51R4VGY53RL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Hell's Angels"}

{"description": "The war in Korea wages on with no end in sight, but the medical corps at the 4077th  valiantly battle on against soulless military bureaucracy, tedium, and insanity. The seventh season of one of television's most decorated series continued to break new ground, with episodes such as \"Point of View,\" which unfolds under the subjective eye of a wounded soldier. And just when you think you have these characters pegged, the writers provocatively challenged them. One of the most powerful episodes of the season, and the series, is \"Preventive Medicine,\" in which Hawkeye (Alan Alda) takes drastic measures to stop a gung-ho colonel from further endangering his men. \"Inga,\" another series benchmark, written and directed by Alda, finds Hawkeye threatened by an accomplished woman doctor (Mariette Hartley).Unlike Larry Linville's one-note Major Burns, David Ogden Stiers found new notes to play as Charles Emerson Winchester III. His character remains, as Hawkeye observes, \"pompous, arrogant, conceited, and a total bore.\" But he's also \"all right\" in three of his finest half-hours: \"Major Ego,\" in which he lets a magazine profile go to his swelled head; \"Rally Round the Flagg, Boys,\" in which he outwits camp nemesis Colonel Flagg; and \"Ain't Love Grand,\" in which he falls for a Korean girl he meets at Rosie's Bar (the setting for another essential episode, \"A Night at Rosie's,\" in which the company seeks refuge from the war). The seven-year itch got to Gary Burghoff, who would depart the series in season 8. Episodes such as \"Hot Lips Is Back in Town,\" in which Radar sweetly woos a new nurse, demonstrate why he would be keenly missed. The two-part \"Our Finest Hour\" is anything but. It is a rehash of the season 4 classic, \"The Interview,\" that serves as a clip episode. This is a rare misstep in another satisfying season that did this series proud.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001DMVZM6", "B001DMVZLM", "B001DMVZN0", "B001DMVZNA", "B001DMVZL2", "B001DMVZNK", "B001DMVZKI", "B001DMVZJY", "B001DMVZJO", "B0001ZJ1HW", "B001DMVZJ4", "B000OT6V1E", "B00008YGS0", "B000B837XS", "B000HT3P5G", "B00BMJ7ZKG", "B003JV0ITA", "0688149553", "B0024HH32A", "B00B04NII6", "B009LDD1X0", "B000XCZGW2", "B002C2KAS6", "B003Q7B7B0", "B002E58FTC", "B000CCBCK8", "B000YGGNGK", "B001OXLGK0", "B0025KVTLW", "B00HRUQ8YS", "B000MGBSH6", "B0025KVNOU", "B000A6T1J0", "B000AMJG5I", "B003L77G2E", "B00B04NJ1M", "B001VFM0ZG", "B000NOIX7K", "B0019F02W6", "B000QFCDAY", "B004G6YAIM", "B0007LXP7W", "B000H7JCHS", "B000EYK4H6", "0810980835", "B000IHYXIK", "B000M53GN6", "B009LDD4V4", "B00BFWKE62", "B000BOH8Z0", "B002XKKX7K", "B00915G6MG", "0783230478", "B0019F02X0", "B00E8OMZGG", "B000BYRCF6", "B000VDDE1I", "B003YLM78U", "B001CQONNQ", "B00008R9MC", "B0009ML2JC", "B00872ZZQW", "B002JVWR4A", "B000O599NK", "B000EWBNMI", "B0060OKO2O", "B0041SI7B6", "B00D2UMHVA", "B003YLM79E", "B000F0UUTG", "B000TGJ8AS", "B00A2L1CJK", "B00AEFXYOA", "B000Q6GUS4", "B000B5XOTS", "B0060MYLCU", "B00GHH9HW2", "B0058EE6O4", "B0009B16TY", "B000GTLB4Y", "B001FB4VXU", "B003XJABZO", "B009MF5BXK", "B008JFURII", "B00GOC75V0", "B0081QF6QS", "B001G0MFPG", "B001CQONOA", "B000BDH6DK", "B000HT3PEM", "B0013LRKVC", "B004D2GMVM", "B00005JLFT", "B00915G6OE", "B000EGDANO", "B005PYKNJY", "B00I4581F4", "B000MGBSIK", "B000EXDS2A"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001DMVZLM", "B001DMVZM6", "B001DMVZKI", "B001DMVZL2"]}, "price": 14.27, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 127191}, "asin": "B0002XVQSA", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51AH25CEJQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "M*A*S*H - Season Seven (Collector's Edition)"}
{"description": "Although it could have been twice as long, this double-DVD set effectively captures over three hours of highlights from one of the most comprehensive and diverse collection of guitarists ever assembled for a single event. Recorded over three days in June of 2004 to benefit Eric Clapton's Crossroads Center in Antigua (as do the sales of this set), the show is not surprisingly heavy on the rootsy blues and country that comprise Clapton's primary inspirations. But it also includes folk (James Taylor), gospel (Robert Randolph & the Family Band), fret-shredding rockers (Steve Vai who delivers a dazzling performance), jazz (John McLaughlin), and, most interestingly, Indian classical music (a stunning piece from Vishwa Mohan Bhatt).Most compelling are the rare and sometimes unusual collaborations. Joe Walsh and Taylor clown around on \"Steamroller Blues,\" and Booker T. & the M.G.'s back both Joe Walsh on a rollicking \"Rocky Mountain Way\" and Los Lobos' David Hidalgo tearing into a sizzling \"The Neighborhood.\" Clapton and J.J. Cale share the stage as do Clapton and Carlos Santana, and a show-stopping blues summit with Robert Cray, Jimmie Vaughan, Hubert Sumlin, B.B. King, Buddy Guy, and Clapton is a treat for all involved.There are some shortcomings. The event isn't presented in chronological order--different stages, days, and backing bands are shuffled with Clapton's own set scattered throughout--ZZ Top's closing is a bit anticlimactic, and there are many omissions due to time constraints. But every act rises to the occasion, and this expertly recorded and shot DVD gives the viewer a front-row seat to a once-in-a-lifetime experience.--Hal Horowitz", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000VR824S", "B00428CPUY", "B003VB5E2E", "B00FLDG52I", "6305610460", "B00FLDG5BE", "157330087X", "B00FLDG5AA", "B000FBHCBY", "6305019681", "B001XJEKGC", "B0000C2IUJ", "B00K0X1PYM", "B001NP8PQM", "B00278U1W0", "B00006SFLX", "B000FVGNPA", "B00ILAWJLO", "B00094OBS4", "B004FRVE18", "B000VT56XQ", "157330056X", "B0018M6J72", "6304498969", "B000BI1YT2", "B0012GMWZW", "B005HWAOCA", "B0002SPPSC", "B00IPL286U", "B00IK7NC9G", "B00DNJ99F2", "B00JAD6DLS", "B000OHZKJA", "B00I5NKPWC", "B00HQI7VMY", "B00EL6NWT0", "B003VRV9FY", "B00KF1CWF0", "B0039USJX8", "B00JGJKNBM", "B00004THAY", "B000001FOP", "B000003TA6", "B005MXQD0G", "B001CRRADU", "B0025X4P6U", "B0000CEB4V", "B00K0HD7TO", "B00EL6NWQI", "B0002KP54E", "B004GF244K", "B00KS6EPKC", "B000BGFBF2", "B00HNTUR1S", "B00377V6J2", "B000053VAC", "B0085KGHI6", "B006T8KT6M", "B00L1OVE4K", "B00005U122", "B00HUQC442", "B000F48D00", "B0019HQIGS", "B0009WFFS6", "B00064VQYO", "B00IYQJUPI", "B00JZO33VK", "B00092ZMDY", "B00005LMA5", "B000UZ4GOQ", "B002N7W3NA", "B000BTC5LW", "B00EL6NWG8", "B00DC3DGSK", "B001NP8PRG", "B00I5NKP7W", "B0007Y89ZM", "B000FTJ700", "B00005NGA2", "B000F0UTTM", "B00DPH7V98", "B00FCFX6OK", "B00JAOK4N0", "B0029W2V8Q", "B00JOWHT2C", "B0000DJZ81", "B00EL6NWB8", "B00IF6WRBG", "B003ZVU1P0", "B000654YRY", "B00009VU35", "B001NXDSLQ", "B00EL6NWUE", "B00H3JHH6Q", "B005FQ2GW4", "B0002IQI2Y", "B0012IWNYU", "B00B7IJC9O", "B00EVPSJOE", "B000660UN0"], "bought_together": ["B000VR824S", "B00428CPUY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00FLDG52I", "B00428CPUY", "B000VR824S", "B00FLDG5AA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 82563}, "categories": [["CDs & Vinyl", "Pop", "Vocal Pop"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Rock", "Blues Rock"], ["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 23.99, "brand": "WEA HOME VIDEO", "asin": "B0002Y4T92", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51V5ejEkUQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Eric Clapton: Crossroads Guitar Festival"}

A funny, clubby preface on a tour bus establishes a tone of lowbrow camaraderie among Jeff Foxworthy, Larry the Cable Guy, Ron White, and Bill Engvall, but once on stage, the differences between each comic's style is considerable. Amiable Engvall kicks things off with gentle gibes: \"Men are basic: eating, sleeping, sex. I can do all those in my truck.\" The decadent air of Ron White darkens the show: \"If I'd known the difference between 'antidote' and 'anecdote,' my friend would still be alive today.\" Foxworthy, the likable Everyman, comments on his wife's hypochondria: \"Honey, you do not have testicular cancer.\" Finally, Larry the Cable Guy lowers the bar on sick-hick humor but does score occasionally: \"I got a vasectomy at Sears.

{"description": "The Dukes of Hazzardsettled into a comfortable run in season 2. The show, originally shot on location in Covington, Georgia, was now permanently produced on a backlot in Burbank, California. While a couple of cast members (Ben Jones, who plays mechanic Cooter Davenport, and James Best, who portrays Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane) briefly boycotted the series in its second year (ushering in a parade of brief replacements, including Mickey Jones of the New Christy Minstrels, Dick Sargent ofBewitched, and James Hampton ofF&#xA0;Troop), the actors relaxed into their now thoroughly cartoonish characters.What else can one say: The General Lee, the souped-up '69, orange Dodge Charger that belongs to cousins Bo (John Schneider) and Luke (Tom Wopat) Duke, has a full tank and is ready to ride. The Duke boys, scions of a proud--though reformed--moonshining family, are still on probation with the law but continue to root out the criminal schemes of diminutive villain Boss Hogg (Sorrell Brooke) and his Wile E. Coyote-like lackey, Sheriff Coltrane. Uncle Jesse (Denver Pyle) is still a fount of grizzled wisdom as well as Boss Hogg's old whiskey-running nemesis. Cousin Daisy (Catherine Bach) still burns up the road with her short-shorts, and Coltrane's deputies Enos (Sonny Shroyer) and Cletus (Rick Hurst) remain idiots with an edge of sympathy. Season 2 highlights include a funny fan favorite called \"The Ghost of General Lee\" (also co-star Schneider's favorite episode), in which Bo and Luke are assumed to have drowned when their stolen car ends up at the bottom of a pond. Hearing that Boss Hogg plans to blame them anyway for a theft they didn't commit, the Duke boys haunt him and Coltrane with apparitions of the General Lee as a \"ghost.\" NASCAR legend Cale Yarborough makes an appealing guest in a story about the development of a secret turbo charger and Hogg's effort to steal it, while Loretta Lynn turns up as herself in a damsel-in-distress tale, featuring the country superstar as a kidnapped hostage. \"Witness for the Persecution\" introduces a recurring theme onDukes: Occasions in which the vile Hogg must be protected from his enemies by hiding out with (gasp) the Dukes. The best ofThe Complete Second Season, however, may be \"Days of Shine and Roses,\" in which Hogg and Uncle Jesse, after watching a film of their old moonshine-delivery exploits with the Ridge Runners Association, get into an argument about who was best and decide to resolve the question with a grudge race.

{"description": "Wonderfallsis probably the most hilarious show you've never seen. An hour-long \"dramedy\" about a young woman who hears the voices of inanimate objects--which instruct her to help out total strangers--the show aired on Fox in early 2004 to critical acclaim and dismal ratings. After airing four times in terrible time slots, the show was quickly canceled, but not before a hue and cry from a small but fervently devoted cadre of fans went up, begging for all 13 episodes to be released on DVD. Thus, the highest-profile DVD release of a canceled show was born, and the nine unaired episodes ofWonderfallsare finally seeing the light of day.You may be wondering: is it worth it to check out a show that was axed so quickly? The answer is an unqualified yes, asWonderfallsis quirky without being precious, sardonic without being bitter, and smart without being a show-off about it. Jaye (Caroline Dhavernas) is a graduate of Brown University who's opted not to put her education to work, and instead lives in a trailer and works at a tourist shop in Niagara Falls, to the consternation of her affluent, successful family. All seems to be going well for this self-proclaimed slacker, until one day a small toy lion speaks to her in enigmatic epigrams, commanding her to help people. Loath to deal in any compassionate way with the rest of humanity, Jaye warily obeys, if only to make the voices stop. Soon, though, she finds herself to be an unwilling humanitarian and accidental hero when more inanimate objects start talking to her, and more people turn out to need her help.The premise may sound a bit too off-the-beaten-path, butWonderfalls' meddling with the ethereal was grounded in a keen awareness of post-college life and the travails befalling young twentysomethings who had no idea where their life was going. And instead of being sanctimonious or inspiring, the show was instead a complex mix of the heartfelt and the angsty, and Dhavernas was one of the most cynically hopeful heroines to grace the small screen. The rest of the cast was also topnotch, including Kate Finneran as Jaye's high-strung sister, Diana Scarwid as her caustic mother, and Tyron Leitso as bartender Eric, whose tentative romance with Jaye was both affecting and hilarious. Think ofWonderfallsas less of a failure and more of a rare opportunity to see some of the most creative television in recent memory.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001FB4VZ8", "B000YAA2SQ", "B00GT2TEPU", "B001A7X0ZO", "B001FB4VZI", "B0000JD29M", "B001BPJJ9G", "B001UJUGZY", "B0024FABCG", "B001XW7ICW", "B0018M6J90", "B001BPJJ82", "B004TFTE8Q", "B0001GF2F6", "B001UJUGZO", "B0025KVKDO", "B00094ARGY", "B001ASIHZG", "B004EC5ITI", "B008XEZXDO", "B000M341SC", "B002AK9UPO", "B00HUCF7AO", "B006H3KQWG", "B000HWZ4MA", "B004CYF78U", "B004TPJN3W", "B00540G3GG", "B00HEQOAQ8", "B0007TKHKC", "B000NA2BEU", "B000GFLEKY", "B0002JP4DW", "B00KLF5J64", "B00CWIMVDW", "B001PKHS6I", "B001EN5I3Q", "B00A8KJN8M", "B005GNU5VK", "B00L326LTI", "B00KCTG4PO", "B00C2535PI", "B000E3L7F0", "B00HEQOAIQ", "B000FL7CAK", "B0006UEVUE", "B00062WUQY", "B00E3UN44W", "B0033WH6MW", "B000OY9VFW", "B0000AQS0F", "B002VRNIZO", "B001M5UDGS", "B00CWIMY3O", "B00435XPFA", "B000XUF6BU", "B0092PX26S", "0804170703", "B001E95ZNS", "B003VSJPPO", "B0081QF6Q8", "B002N5N5LG", "B00JAQJNN0", "B001XRLWLU", "B000ATQYXI", "B004BZ5AHI", "B006JN87WK", "B00005JNU5", "B00BSU0FQA", "B00KHA9BQ2", "B001PMRBMC", "B002HFWBI0", "B00IKKQT1G", "B009LDCVJU", "B002C3GTLC", "B009LDCW1M", "B00ECR7KX2", "B001B9LWME", "B0056GLNQI", "B005G1729K", "B003L77GQ0", "B0017KP8Y0", "B003VVBZ7M", "B002DQSKME", "B001DF681G", "0425228223", "B003X82CZ2", "B00I099JSW", "B00ISSF7S6", "B00191AEYQ", "B00I3H61AA", "B00662CH02", "1402799977", "B000BW7QWW", "B001QE99BA", "B00GTZWZH6", "B0037AGB9O", "B00HGE90Z4", "B0025KVKBQ", "B005PPMHO2"], "bought_together": ["B001FB4VZ8", "B000YAA2SQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001FB4VZ8", "B000YAA2SQ", "B001BPJJ9G", "B00GT2TEPU"]}, "price": 19.17, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 25154}, "asin": "B0006GAO18", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51PysUka7tL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Wonderfalls - The Complete Series"}

{"description": "Andrzej Wajda's first three features form a landmark in Polish cinema, and a monument of that great decade of European movies, the 1950s. Working mostly during a thaw in Soviet control over his homeland, Wajda and his collaborators created three films that looked back at the Second World War from the perspective of a new generation whose youth was defined by the catastrophe of Nazi occupation and Soviet control. The first film is titledA Generation(1955), as though to sum up the collective feeling. It's set in Warsaw in 1943, as young workers join the anti-Nazi resistance movement (including an attempt to help Jews escape from the ghetto). Shot in real locations, but with an expressionistic eye,A Generationis especially drawn to the ambiguous supporting character played by Tadeusz Janczar, a much more conflicted and modern character than the nominal hero. (Roman Polanski plays one of the fighters.)Kanal(1957) tracks the final hours of the Warsaw Uprising, a rebellion by the Poles and their Home Army against the Germans. (The Russian army, parked on the other side of the Vistula River, allowed the Poles to be wiped out without interference.) First we meet the characters in a last stand at a bombed-out field of urban rubble, then follow them in a miserable escape through the dank, gas-filled sewers beneath the city. The desperation of final heroic acts, and Wajda's ingenuity in finding new ways to shoot in the sewer sets, keeps the film balanced in nerve-wracking suspense.Set on the final day of World War II,Ashes and Diamondsexplodes with mixed-up passion and anger, and with the deliberately James Dean-like performance of Polish icon Zbigniew Cybulski. Wadja expands his range here with a visual dynamism that includes a heady use of symbols and striking borrowings fromCitizen Kaneand film noir. The nervy, dark-spectacled Cybulski plays a Home Army member out to assassinate a Communist official, an assignment bungled in the opening sequence. So the job still needs completing, but the would-be assassin is diverted by a melancholy barmaid and the possibility of turning away from violence... but this is Poland, and wry fatalism prevails. The doomed national feeling is maintained in powerful fashion in these three movies--which are not, technically speaking, a trilogy, though they have always spiritually been of-a-piece.Criterion assembled this DVD set with Wajda's approval, and he appears in illuminating half-hour interview segments on each disc (along with filmmaker Janusz Morgenstern and critic Jerzy Plazewski). Valuable production stills and posters, Wajda's film-school short \"Ceramics from Ilza,\" and essays are included. Most importantly, the digital transfers themselves are perfectly stunning.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0028YW3CE", "B002U6DVQ2", "B000YKT4BW", "B0000BWVCR", "B00ID8H8EW", "B0000A02TX", "B0000633SD", "B0000AZKJW", "B000093NR0", "B00GBT637S", "B00005M2C7", "B00005EBSF", "B00005NFZB", "B00F98FOFY", "B002KECJZ8", "B00IGK6T9W", "B001CW7ZSU", "B00GBT6332", "B003ICZW8C", "B007UI0CIA", "B000OPPADS", "B002QP145C", "B00GPPXOTS", "B0047P5FTK", "B00GPPXNLC", "B00HE011DE", "B0006Z2NE0", "B0026VBOJM", "B0019X3ZZO", "B00IGK6TH4", "B000BB14I0", "B00AQ6J5YA", "B002AFX53W", "B000PKG6O4", "B00009MEA0", "B00GRA7M2G", "B000BB14IA", "B001LMU1C8", "B00BX49BJI", "B0012Z363A", "B001WLMOMS", "B000WC39FY", "B00B83OIVA", "B000TGCR38", "B000E5N63Y", "B000093NQZ", "B000BR6QIW", "B00CEIOHPU", "B00FGVS07S", "B000ASKKHU", "6305081034", "B002ZQX090", "B000244EWO", "B0024EWP6W", "B009VO9XSG", "B003YKYX7Y", "B00005QAPJ", "B00065GX64", "B00HE010QM", "B00005BHW6", "B004OOL73W", "B00007CVS2", "B001BEK8CE", "B00F98FNNM", "B00007CVS3", "B00AQ6J6H6", "B0083Q4JXM", "B0016B6ZEC", "B007A9EGA4", "B0087ZG7OI", "B0000AINJ8", "B001SMC9L2", "B008ZDC7M8", "B0009WIE2A", "B00092ZLEY", "B005KQVE1S", "B005HQBO9I", "B000AQKUG8", "B0002V7O0Q", "B00007L4I6", "B008Y5OWKW", "B001BSBBDK", "B00F98FOI6", "B00009QG5Y", "B004CSKD2Q", "B00H4ZEFTQ", "1476746583", "0781810353", "1903364914", "0801451248", "B00009QG60", "0060914939", "B0000A02X9", "B000FBHCK0", "B0000AQS4F"], "bought_together": ["B0028YW3CE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0028YW3CE", "B0000CEB4N", "B000ASKKHU", "B000AQKUG8"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 172323}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 61.95, "brand": "Image Entertainment", "asin": "B0007989ZW", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41rKmtJsHXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Andrzej Wajda: Three War Films (A Generation / Kanal / Ashes &amp; Diamonds) (The Criterion Collection)"}
{"description": "Aaron Spelling's addictive primetime soap opera,Dynasty, ran for nine seasons on ABC, a saga of the rich and super-rich, family feuds and betrayals, class conflicts, revenge, corruption, and power. The 13 episodes included in this first-season boxed set introduce a wide range of characters (quite a few dispensed by season 2) in the orbit of oil empire Denver Carrington and its acquisitive, stop-at-nothing CEO, Blake Carrington (John Forsythe, who was simultaneously providing the off-screen voice of Charlie inSpelling'sCharlie's Angels). Of particular interest is the way Blake and Denver Carrington's business problems--a groundswell of anti-American sentiment in oil-rich Arab nations, the recent energy shortage in the U.S., disagreement about developing alternative fuel sources with tax dollars--are a window onto real-world events whenDynastydebuted in 1981.But drama ripped from yesterday's headlines is not what the show is about, and it isn't long before Blake's conflicts with, well, just about everyone move to center stage. Above all is his pending marriage to former secretary Krystle Grant Jennings (Linda Evans), who loves Blake but worries that he sees her as a possession to be charmed or bullied into compliance with his tyrannical worldview. Complicating matters is Krsytle's old romance with a Denver Carrington geologist, Matthew Blaisdel (Bo Hopkins, leaning hard on his soulful, James Dean impression), who is struggling to make his marriage to the mentally ill Claudia (Pamela Bellwood) work out. Meanwhile, two of Blake's grownup kids, Fallon (Pamela Sue Martin) and Steven (Al Corley), are home for the wedding but at serious odds with dear old dad. (Blake wants Fallon to marry a competitor's son in the interest of preserving Denver Carrington. He also refuses to speak with Steven after discovering the latter has been in a gay relationship.) On the horizon is Blake's troublesome former wife, Alexis, who wasn't cast yet (she's eventually portrayed by Joan Collins in season 2), but who makes a veiled appearance (played by another actress) at a particularly inauspicious moment for poor Blake in the season finale. There's more: industrial sabotage, Fallon's affair with a chauffeur, an unexpected bond between Steven and Claudia.Dynastywouldn't be as much fun without its endless cascade of broken hearts and dire circumstances, and it reminds us that wealth can sometimes be a peculiar kind of hell.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000QUEQ68", "B0015I2S7E", "B001BN4WLS", "B001QU9RRK", "B004X1M3DE", "B002VJ05EE", "B004X1M47O", "B007R915RE", "B00005JOA4", "B00CD45J5W", "B000CS45AG", "B000PGUT8C", "B00H5NY6F0", "B0009IW894", "B002VJ05EO", "B00028G7LG", "B007R915U6", "B000BVM1TG", "B000FI9OD6", "B004X1M4BU", "B000PAAK0A", "B007R915QK", "B0016I0AGY", "B00450S800", "B000JLTRFE", "B000YGGNIS", "B001JAHPX0", "B004H83IHI", "B001C9S0F0", "B001JAHPXK", "B00CD45J52", "B00CD45JGG", "B001JAHPXA", "B001JAHPWQ", "B00D4ABT8K", "B00008WJEZ", "B000B8IA3U", "B00HQLZCIQ", "B000FDFSH2", "B0069RLBF6", "B00E7XS4EA", "B000H7JCGE", "B0028RABR0", "B009GYS70Q", "B000ASDFIG", "B000Z6GT18", "B0001BS3IE", "B00HZMZ286", "B0018O5WTQ", "B00274SIVA", "B00008EYBH", "B00074DY16", "B000H7JCG4", "B008K1PWMW", "B00188XHF8", "B00AEBB9FA", "B000BKDNVM", "B001E6JC26", "B005M5OSBU", "B00HV0TJM2", "B00018D3RI", "B00GHH9HUE", "B0000DFZ5O", "B000NJMJHK", "B000UX6TJ8", "B001AQR3LC", "B00441GZ2S", "B003W5C0TY", "B005DEUER2", "B00009Y3RW", "B000VZADPQ", "B00005JNHU", "B000GB75CO", "B00DZP1C18", "B000HXDWG4", "B000035P59", "B0042FDCO0", "B001BNFR6M", "B000LV6VZQ", "630530887X", "B000RZIGSQ", "B000VS6R30", "B000G1R3A8", "B002U4UZT0", "B00HRUQA6O", "B00005JOJR", "B004HHX9PK", "1593156480", "B000NA78SE", "B0001907BW", "B003RHZ6CK", "B002OOWKYE", "B0009JQN6M", "B0095FJHWI", "B005EVY8NA", "B002BWQ4C8", "B00K6D1QV8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00CD45J5W", "B000QUEQ68", "B001BN4WLS", "B0015I2S7E"]}, "price": 1.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 59198}, "asin": "B0007IO6V4", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51EoV5sE4qL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Dynasty: Season 1"}
{"description": "A decade has passed in the small town where the originalSandlotgang banded together during the summer of &#x92;62 to play baseball and battle the Beast. Now comes the sequel, a campy romp back to the dugout where nine new kids descend on the diamond only to discover that a descendant of the Beast lives in Mr. Mertle&#x92;s backyard--a monster of mythical proportions known as \"The Great Fear.\" Director/writer David Evans cleverly ties his two films together by introducing Johnnie Smalls, kid brother of Scotty Smalls (\"You&#x92;re killin&#x92; me, Smalls\") who is well-versed in the legendary struggle for possession of the Babe Ruth baseball. Smalls befriends the sandlot gang (which now includes three girls) and its leader, David Vincent Durango, and relates the rumor of \"a mutated, insane Bigfoot dog thing\" behind the left field fence. Summer unfolds with baseball rivalries, rocket launchers, and the infamous Carnival kissing booth, but fate will forever change the history of the sandlot when a crisis forces Smalls and Durango to join forces against The Fear. Regardless of one&#x92;s sentiments on sequels, Evans&#x92;  writing in this remake is nearly as fresh and full of memorable quips as the original, including his characteristically understated narration. And while the film may be faulted for its forced melodrama and unseasoned cast, James Earl Jones lends his star appeal and the 70s soundtrack will make you wish for the days when fireworks were legal. Rated PG for profanity and raunchy humor.

{"description": "A vintage Stephen King concept unfolds inRiding the Bullet:  a college kid, circa 1970, must hitchhike a very long (and very dark) hundred miles to visit his hospitalized mother. The ghosts waiting for him along the way are either real or of his own mind (which seems to be a dark place itself). As a King short story, this might have been a usefully frightening premise, but it's almost entirely literary; on screen, it boils down to a guy walking down a road at night. Jonathan Jackson is suitably tortured in the lead role (or roles--he frequently appears double on screen, arguing with himself), but the movie is stolen by David Arquette, rocking it up as a '50s greaser who died in a car crash years earlier. Barbara Hershey and Erika Christensen are wasted in support. There's a strain to make the Woodstock-era setting relevant, but this doesn't seem to have a great deal to do with the private demons of the protagonist. (And if you're going to set it in 1970, how hard is it to catch dialogue anachronisms?)

{"description": "Joan Crawford bashes her way through this melodrama inspired by the Bugsy Siegel-Virginia Hill story. Our girl walks out of tacky poverty at the beginning and re-shapes herself into a fur-lined mobster's moll, her will of steel out-pointing the men at every stop. David Brian (recently herFlamingo Roadco-star) is the looming blond monster who runs the organization, Steve Cochran is the Bugsy guy building his own network in Nevada, and Kent Smith is the meek accountant Joan bullies into becoming a syndicate player. It's all from that mid-career post-Mildred Pierceperiod that served Crawford so well, with the full-on film noir look (Ted McCord photographed) and the strong whiff of American sleaze.Joan Crawford's face had assumed its masklike quality at this point, and at times she seems more of a business manager than an actress:  organizing each scene, pushing the story along to its next stop. In its own over-the-top way, it works:  there isn't a moment when she doesn't seem capable of devouring anybody that stands in her way. Everything is writ large in this movie, which makes it a fitting target for a Carol Burnett send-up... and which also makes it a great deal of fun.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0008ENICA", "B0008ENI98", "B0010KHOSK", "B0008ENIAC", "B006X0ZN3K", "B00000IPHP", "B00AG6NO7O", "B0007PALUM", "B00DSAUKKY", "B00AEBBA7W", "B00C3ALM02", "B000EXDSBG", "B000RXVND8", "B000EXDSBQ", "B0012OX7DA", "B0087ZG7OI", "B0008ENIDE", "B00KIZYDCI", "B0008ENIDO", "B00027JYLM", "B00C3ALKWM", "B00005RDRP", "B00023P4GA", "B00I9BU3M2", "B002EAYE9W", "B00EKGX2P0", "B009X919UE", "B001CQONHW", "B00I9BU60Q", "B00276T2KO", "B004LB5FEA", "B001D5DQHK", "B000055XM8", "B00023P4G0", "B00004RER5", "B00FPUN21O", "B008BSM1CI", "B00004XPPK", "B00AQ6J5YA", "B0010KHOSA", "B004RA5AU4", "B0089LT7ZG", "B002ID094Y", "B002YNQEFG", "B002YNQEF6", "B001CC7PM6", "B00466JALY", "B00AEFXRWO", "B00266UX6W", "B000068TPG", "B00KIZY2QA", "B005152C9G", "B0007ZEO8C", "B00EL6A7XE", "B004H83IFU", "B001D8W7EK", "B00CVB6XF2", "B0082LUEFA", "B000JF5T5W", "B006TXDNEW", "B0041URXZK", "B0024FAG80", "B000XNZ7NO", "B0000549B1", "B00I04SVV8", "6305999872", "B00J2PQYG8", "B001QFFBAM", "B0009OL8IK", "B00EL6A9CI", "B000EU1Q2C", "B000E8JO32", "B000E6ESWG", "B0000AZKO7", "B000KGGJ1I", "B000B8384Q", "B00AB2NX1K", "B0008ENICU", "B0026ZQJP2", "B0026RCJHM", "B00004W19C", "B000LN6UHI", "B00DZP1C9K", "B000EU1Q22", "B003B3V0X4", "B00074DY0W", "B000KJTGFG", "B0026ZQJT8", "B0009S4IKQ", "B000244EZ6", "B000B83846", "B0047BXR1C", "B000N3T0H8", "B00AB2NX4M", "B0006UEVVI", "B0012KSUV8", "B002TOL4B4", "B000PKG6OE", "B001CC7PLW", "B000KHI2FS"], "bought_together": ["B0008ENICA", "B0008ENI98"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0008ENID4", "0877973067", "B0008ENIAC", "B0008ENI98"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 31248}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.91, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B0008ENI84", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/512HMdtuA4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Damned Don't Cry"}

{"description": "In Paris, professional assassin Mireille Bouquet meets emotionally shattered Kirika Yumura: neither woman can remember her past, but they're both extremely good at killing people. (Kirika doesn't even look--she just points the gun and fires and her victim falls.) The two women form a partnership as \"Noir,\" but after a couple of murders for hire, they realize someone is trying to killthem. The  mysteriousSoldatsseem to be everywhere, so it's kill or be killed. The only recurring characters inNoirare amnesiacs, who are essentially blank slates and therefore not very interesting. Director Kouichi Mashimo may set new record for repeating footage in an animated series--some shots crop up three times in a single episode, including portentous images whose significance is more apparent than real. The result feels like a watered-down combination ofGunsmith CatsandSerial Experiments Lain. This set contains the complete six volume series.

{"description": "Dallas: The Complete Third Season, originally broadcast in the fall of 1979 through early 1980, surely represents one of the most raucous and tantalizing years in the life of any television series in history. Murder, banking fraud, kidnapping, adultery, alcoholism, cancer, vengeance, a miscarriage, extortion, bribery, and astounding levels of betrayal both in business and private lives are just part of the catalogue of sins that make season 3 particularly juicy. Actually, what makes the 25 episodes in this box set so much fun to watch is a viewer's gradual awareness that every crime committed, every ethical breach or personal tragedy is part of an overall design, reverberating in dozens of directions and affecting multiple relationships and numerous schemes. As enjoyable as each program is on its own terms, it's quite clear that by the 25th episode, \"A House Divided,\" in which a major character receives a surprise-ending comeuppance, that all chickens were intended to come home to roost in the last show's very clever script.A remarkable number of story threads found their way into season 3. Starting with a two-parter concerning the kidnapping of a newborn baby belonging to J.R. (Larry Hagman) and Sue Ellen Ewing (Linda Gray), problems just keep on sprouting like weeds. First, there's Sue Ellen's emotional deep-freeze and refusal to nurture her child as a healthy mom should, which in turn prompts the childless Pamela Ewing (Victoria Principal) to free her maternal instincts toward J.R.'s son, much to the chagrin of J.R.'s brother, Bobby (Patrick Duffy). Meanwhile, teenager Lucy (Charlene Tilton), abandoned daughter of missing Ewing son Gary (David Ackroyd), threatens to teach J.R.'s son, one day, to turn against the Ewing clan, inspiring J.R. to escalate plans to get rid of Lucy any way possible. (Gary, by the way, kicks into gear a famousDallasspin-off by moving to Knots Landing, California.) Matriarch Miss Ellie (Barbara Bel Geddes) faces a mastectomy, making her worry that husband Jock (Jim Davis) will stop loving her, though he faces problems of his own when a skeleton found buried on Ewing property turns up near Jock's missing handgun. (Whoops.) Finally, J.R.'s almost Shakespearean manipulation of the sale of Asian oil fields to old family friends, just before those fields are nationalized, is brilliantly wicked stuff. His actions have enormous, grievous ramifications--not least of all for J.R.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000BVM1TG", "B00028G7LG", "B000FI9OD6", "B000JLTRFE", "B000PAAK0A", "B000YGGNIS", "B0016I0AGY", "B001C9S0F0", "B001JAHPWQ", "B001JAHPX0", "B001JAHPXA", "B001JAHPXK", "B004H83IHI", "B009GYS70Q", "B000CS45AG", "B00E7XS4EA", "B000PGUT8C", "B00CD45J5W", "B001BN4WLS", "B0015I2S7E", "B00005JOA4", "B004X1M47O", "B004X1M3DE", "B002VJ05EE", "B001QU9RRK", "B000QUEQ68", "B0007IO6V4", "B00AQ6ROHK", "B007R915RE", "B00BMSU950", "B001VB8UCW", "1581824726", "B002VJ05EO", "B0002Y4T7O", "0743221818", "B0041SI7A2", "B003CNQPMY", "B004IB04S0", "B003FSTN8E", "B000ETRA5U", "B0052SO0LK", "6304696612", "B000MGBSI0", "B000UAE7UY", "B005DLN1LG", "B001UHOWYM", "B00074DY16", "B00H5NY6F0", "B0007WFXL2", "0810908360", "B004GJYRFA", "B003F9LS90", "B0053TWVSC", "B005IQGNHK", "B0007TKNDS", "B0042FDCO0", "B005LFQRTC", "B000EXDSCA", "B00AMSS3UO", "B000067S1G", "B00JEZWRE4", "B005DGKBDC", "B000083C6R", "B000PISZ86", "B000MCH5AO", "B00H9LHVHI", "B003YLM79E", "B00005JO4F", "B000LXH3SI", "B0009B16TY", "B00GHH9HW2", "B00JM5C8WM", "B001LM64UG", "B000E5KQMI", "B00CD45J52", "B0001BS3IE", "B00168ML34", "B0007WQHFS", "B000FSME10", "B001GLFPWK", "B000WQWPSM", "B00BUWD7E8", "B0045HCJHQ", "B000O77SNG", "B0028SVY3Y", "B0001ZMWYG", "B001AI776G", "B000XT1P5C", "B000EHSVNW", "B008H6GHII", "B0027CSMY0", "B005ET4NHI", "B005Z28M58", "B00020H9NO", "B008JFURII", "B0089BSLKS", "B00IN69P0E", "B00AEBB86U", "B002E58FTW", "B000P6YNTI"], "bought_together": ["B000BVM1TG", "B00028G7LG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00028G7LG", "B00E7XS4EA", "B009GYS70Q", "B000BVM1TG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 12423}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 16.9, "brand": "WEA", "asin": "B0009IW894", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Mb55nneCL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Dallas: Season 3"}

When he teams up with skeptical policewoman Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz) to solve the mysterious suicide of her twin sister, their investigation takes them through the world of demons and angels that exists just beneath the landscape of contemporary Los Angeles. Caught in a catastrophic series of otherworldly events, the two become inextricably involved and seek to find their own peace at whatever cost.DVD Features:Additional Scenes:18 minutes of Deleted Scenes with Optional Commentary by Francis LawrenceAlternate endingsAudio CommentaryDocumentaries:THE PRODUCTION FROM HELL *Director's Confessional *Collision with Evil *Holy Relics IMAGINING THE UNDERWORLD *Hellscape *Visualizing Vermin *Warrior Wings *Unholy Abduction *Demon Face [Easter Egg] FORESIGHT: THE POWER OF PRE-VISUALIZATION with Optional Commentary by Francis LawrenceDocumentary:Conjuring Constantine: from comic book to movieFeaturette:Imagining the Underworld * Hellscape * Visualizing Vermin * Warrior Wings * Unholy Abduction * Demon Face [Easter Egg]Music Video:A Perfect Circle's \"Passive\" music videoTheatrical Trailer", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305065551", "B00111YM5G", "B0021L8V34", "B0002KVUKM", "6305718954", "B000FS9FCG", "B005JJCMOO", "B001SGEUYW", "B001DJLD1M", "B00005JM5B", "B001VLFE7G", "B002ZG98N2", "0767802454", "B003HKN52U", "B004SIP9Z6", "B001QTXM5Y", "B002GSXKNI", "B001AK3S4Y", "B0007P0Y7C", "B00011CZRE", "B001BP4K22", "B0000TPA0G", "B0013J55B6", "B00AEFXCLU", "B00003CXND", "B001F7MSFM", "B0085A9HU6", "B0002IQMAM", "B0013FDM7E", "B002ZG97CO", "B0006GANOQ", "B000069I1I", "B0000959N0", "B002GIBVWA", "B004P7CMOQ", "B002SG7Z7A", "B003YOZNBU", "B00003CXZ1", "B004EPYZO4", "B00111YM5Q", "B001BRJZPW", "B002ZG997C", "B000HEWEE4", "078322799X", "6305767866", "B0007DFJ0G", "B007D5E7C2", "B00005JA8B", "B00005JN0T", "B008JFUPPI", "B00HEPDGKA", "B0021L8UXA", "6304712499", "B002LMSWN2", "B002O3Z4XY", "B000EQHXN2", "B000274T94", "B001QB9H1U", "0780624890", "B00005JN0W", "B001GUYB08", "B001GKJ2E8", "B002O3Z50Q", "B000TGJ80S", "B0007PALZ2", "B00FEHCQEC", "B002GHHHN8", "B00AEFYGBA", "B0006L0LOS", "B00005JPD0", "B002UZCJ8Y", "B000FGGE68", "B000K4WPCC", "B003PIUIIS", "B000NQRR1Q", "B002O5M4T4", "B0045HCJGC", "B00BEJL6JK", "1558908846", "B000BTJDGC", "B000P0J0AQ", "B000TJ6PBK", "B00AEFY5B6", "B006VRRGNK", "B008JFUNYG", "B00195FUDC", "B00004BZIY", "B001DHXT20", "B00006FDCD", "B000NTMA0Q", "B000JMK6LW", "B0000844I8", "B00005JOC9", "B00005JLKN", "B00005UQ9W", "B000QXDED6", "B002O3Z510", "0783240295", "B00005JN5E", "B000XA5K48"], "bought_together": ["6305065551"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0002KVUKM", "B00634MLIQ", "B0021L8V34", "6305065551"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 46632}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 26.0, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B0009KA7BS", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51K-5Yf0UrL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Constantine (Two-Disc Deluxe Edition)"}
{"description": "Best friends Harry and Moe are go-getters inside a Newark mob outfit. They go get the boss's drycleaning. They go get his car. Now they have a new task: go get each other. The boss has secretly hired each pal to whack the other. Brian De Palma, whose Scarface and Carlito's Way are mobster-movie classics, finds the genre's funny bone in a comedy \"filled with ideas and gags and great characters. It never runs dry\" (Roger Ebert, Chicago Sun-Times). Dan Hedaya and Harvey Keitel are among the ensemble's portrayers of kingpins and palookas. And Danny DeVito and Joe Piscopo play the pals whose friendship might survive the mob - if they don't kill each other first.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005T7HW", "B000LBL3TK", "0790742071", "B00005T7I0", "B00008O38F", "B000FOPPCO", "B00JJOY47I", "B00JJOY45U", "B005IX3C4U", "B00015YVDG", "B00CCMKPO0", "B00005V5NS", "B002TOL49G", "B0009HMTKI", "B00062IVM6", "0792845811", "B0009HLD4Q", "B000E5KQHI", "B00168IWU0", "B00E5S2HGS", "B00005IA7Y", "B0000A98ZO", "B007TBIUSM", "B000P0J09M", "B001C0I61M", "B000F6ZIII", "B000056VOZ", "B003TTBA0S", "B00860YHRS", "B00009Y3PV", "B00827OXJ2", "B0000VV508", "B00DW5IL92", "B00008L3S9", "B0000AMJEK", "B0001FVDQ4", "155890834X", "B00D3LA6AW", "B00002RAO2", "B000062UHB", "B001W72VPW", "B00BTYRB58", "B00020HAWO", "B004SIP9Z6", "B00005LIRB", "B00013WVKI", "B0002V7O3I", "B000SFOW8I", "B0009PVZD2", "B00EVU3S0E", "B00441GYQ0", "B004G7XCRQ", "B00407PNZ6", "B00BWQTUTS", "B0013D8LI6", "B005QX8UEE", "0780625277", "6305268797", "B0002ZSKMS", "B00020X88E", "0783230354", "B004Y72Y4K", "B00005O06Q", "B00HEPDLFK", "B00005QAOZ", "B00AATFJK2", "B0000AOX0F", "B00AEFY5GQ", "B00004XPPB", "B00009AOAZ", "B0053TWVSC", "B00AEBBA1S", "B00441GYUG", "B008JFURKG", "B00BTYSIWI", "B004DOVE8Q"], "bought_together": ["B00005T7HW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000P0J09M", "B000286RP2", "B00AEBB9NM", "B0030VANJO"]}, "price": 32.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 128885}, "asin": "B0009PVZDM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51oeDceX4mL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Wise Guys"}

{"description": "Movie studios, by and large, avoid controversial subjects like race the way you might avoid a hive of angry bees. So it's remarkable thatCrasheven got made; that it's a rich, intelligent, and moving exploration of the interlocking lives of a dozen Los Angeles residents--black, white, latino, Asian, and Persian--is downright amazing. A politically nervous district attorney (Brendan Fraser) and his high-strung wife (Sandra Bullock, biting into a welcome change of pace fromMiss Congeniality) get car-jacked by an oddly sociological pair of young black men (Larenz Tate and Chris \"Ludacris\" Bridges); a rich black T.V. director (Terrence Howard) and his wife (Thandie Newton) get pulled over by a white racist cop (Matt Dillon) and his reluctant partner (Ryan Phillipe); a detective (Don Cheadle) and his Latina partner and lover (Jennifer Esposito) investigate a white cop who shot a black cop--these are only three of the interlocking stories that reach up and down class lines. Writer/director Paul Haggis (who wrote the screenplay forMillion Dollar Baby) spins every character in unpredictable directions, refusing to let anyone sink into a stereotype. The cast--ranging from the famous names above to lesser-known but just as capable actors like Michael Pena (Buffalo Soldiers) and Loretta Devine (Woman Thou Art Loosed)--meets the strong script head-on, delivering galvanizing performances in short vignettes, brief glimpses that build with gut-wrenching force.

{"description": "Nobody Knows, an extraordinary film from Japanese director Kore-Eda Hirokazu, is a heartbreaking and touching story about how selfish a single mother can be to her four children, and how resilient children can be. Kicked out of several apartments for her large brood, Keiko (Japanese pop star You) sneaks them in to a new one (two inside the suitcases) and goes over the house rules: No loud noises. They must stay hidden inside the apartment all day, every day. Only Akira, the oldest, leaves to do grocery shopping while she works. He also makes dinner while Keiko goes out on dates (implying to her children that she's looking for a rich husband so that they can all live in a big house together).One day, Keiko (not a villain, but an unsympathetic, helium-voiced child herself) announces she's going away for a few weeks to work. She soon emerges every few months, only to drop off money before taking off again, at one point, for good. Akira forgoes any normal 12-year-old's upbringing (even school) to play mother, father, even Santa Claus to his siblings. There's a trapped feeling inNobody Knows. For the younger kids, it's the inability to escape to the outside world. For Akira, it's seeing the outside world and knowing he has too many responsibilities to participate in it--when he tries, the results are disastrous. As the children grow up and resources become more scarce, the film's tenacity to show every painful detail of their existence slows the pace to almost a standstill. Still, it's a lovely, haunting tale beset with unforced performances from its young actors, particularly Yagira, who won the best actor prize at Cannes. --Ellen A.

{"description": "Virtually unseeable for half a century,House by the River, the rarest of Fritz Lang's American films, proves to be an atmospheric serving of Southern Gothic with style and perversity to burn. This is a happy surprise, given that the film was made at a low point in Lang's career, at a Poverty Row studio, with a low-wattage cast. Louis Hayward--whose dark, spoiled good looks and insinuating smile suggest Orson Welles' tawdry evil twin--plays an effete author in a small 19th-century town. One hot, lazy afternoon he's tempted (in a brilliantly directed scene) by thoughts of the comely maid soaking in his upstairs bathroom. There follows an awkward pass, a hand over her mouth, and suddenly he finds himself an accidental murderer. With a dead body to get rid of, living by a river comes in handy. But on this river, secrets have a way of returning with the tide.The script by Mel Dinelli (who had just written the trim 1949 thrillerThe Window) ably milks the suspense, and there's a creepy moonlit search by rowboat for the now-you-see-it, now-you-don't corpse. The failed novelist, beginning to relish his guilt, acquires fresh inspiration as a writer and also becomes a cagy manipulator of other people, notably the wife (Jane Wyatt) who doesn't know what he's done, and the crippled brother (Lee Bowman) who does. Making a virtue of production resources only slightly upscale of Edgar G. Ulmer, Lang turns the titular domicile into an Expressionist hothouse where lace curtains yield a web of shadows, potted plants throw jagged black spears across high-key faces, and the breeze from the river is anything but fresh. Mastered from British archival materials, the DVD gleams like a cutlery-store window.--Richard T.

{"description": "The teaming of Johnny Knoxville (Jackass: The Movie) and Seann William Scott (Dude, Where's My Car?) as well as the presence of the '70s-flavored car chases that were a specialty of the TV series guarantees thatThe Dukes of Hazzardwill be even more lowbrow than the CBS TV series (1979-85) that inspired it.

{"description": "Created by Frank Lupo (The A-Team),Hunterwas one of producer Stephen J. Cannell's more tough-minded cop shows. Credit the character of LAPD Det. Sgt. Rick Hunter (former NFL player Fred Dryer). Supplying the yin to Hunter's yang was partner Sgt. Dee Dee McCall (Stepfanie Kramer). \"Sometimes a soft approach can work,\" she explains in the season premiere (\"Overnight Sensation\"). Unfortunately, Capt. Devane (Charles Hallahan) pulls the plug on their partnership in the following episode (\"Change Partners and Dance\"). \"You and Hunter have gotten too close,\" he tells a disappointed McCall. To add insult to injury, Hunter takes the separation in stride. She thought they were friends. As it turns out, Hunter feels the same way and there's more to the breakup than meets the eye.Other third season developments revolve around romance. Granted, Ray Wise (Twin Peaks) may be a murder suspect, but the culinary-challenged McCall can't resist a man who knows his way around a kitchen (\"Crime of Passion\"). A few episodes later, Hunter falls for a fellow detective with a few dirty secrets (\"From San Francisco with Love\"). Fortunately, there will be happier times ahead (that Hunterdoesget around). Filling out the quartet is Arnold \"Sporty\" James (originalSNLcast member Garrett Morris), their snappily dressed informant, who provides a welcome jolt of eccentricity. In \"Love, Hate, and Sporty James,\" he takes a rare lead, demonstrating some decent dramatic chops.Twenty-two episodes were produced forHunter's third year, including the two-part finale (\"Hot Pursuit\"). Notable guests include Chaka Khan (\"The Cradle Will Rock\"),Star Trek: The Next Generationregulars Brent Spiner (\"The Contract\") and Marina Sirtis (\"Down and Under\"), and future TV superstars Anthony LaPaglia (the Australian-set \"Down and Under\") and a pompadour-sporting George Clooney (\"Double Exposure\").

{"description": "Following a tumultuousthird seasonthat culminated in the shooting of likeable villain J.R. Ewing (Larry Hagman) by an unknown assailant,Dallas: The Complete Fourth Seasonis relatively tame by comparison. Still, it begins with no fewer than four episodes stretching out the mystery of who (from a wide field of candidates) actually shot J.R., with the victim's alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), looking like the chief suspect. Meanwhile, with J.R. out of commission and possibly paralyzed by a bullet pressing against his spine, brother Bobby (Patrick Duffy) reluctantly takes the reins of Ewing Oil at the insistence of his father, Jock (Jim Davis). Prepared to buy a refinery at a bargain price&#x97;something Jock always wanted but J.R. could never deliver&#x97;Bobby is set to take Ewing Oil to a new level of success, but finds his authority undercut by J.R., who is pulling strings from his hospital bed.Another suspect in the shooting, Cliff Barnes (Ken Kercheval), brother of Bobby's wife, Pam (Victoria Principal), tries to jumpstart his return to Texas politics by making trouble for the Ewings in the Texas legislature. Bobby himself, burned out on the family business, tries his own hand at the state senate, a useful place to be once Jock and Ewing matriarch Miss Ellie (Barbara Bel Geddes), mired in a personal conflict that heads toward divorce, find themselves on opposite sides in a land dispute. Other story threads include a rocky marriage between granddaughter Lucy (Charlene Tilton) and a medical student (Leigh McCloskey), and extramarital distraction for lonely Pam and Sue Ellen. Perhaps the biggest scandal of the season is J.R.'s manipulation of a counterrevolution in the Southeast Asian country where Ewing Oil fields were disastrously nationalized--a crime that could come back to haunt him.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0009IW894", "B000FI9OD6", "B000JLTRFE", "B00028G7LG", "B000PAAK0A", "B000YGGNIS", "B0016I0AGY", "B001C9S0F0", "B001JAHPWQ", "B001JAHPX0", "B001JAHPXA", "B001JAHPXK", "B004H83IHI", "B000CS45AG", "B009GYS70Q", "B00E7XS4EA", "B00CD45J5W", "B001BN4WLS", "B0015I2S7E", "B000PGUT8C", "B00005JOA4", "B004X1M47O", "B004X1M3DE", "B001QU9RRK", "B002VJ05EE", "B007R915RE", "1581824726", "B002VJ05EO", "B003FSTN8E", "B0002Y4T7O", "B0007IO6V4", "B002XKKX8E", "B007R915U6", "B004IB04S0", "B0041SI7A2", "B003CNQPMY", "B00H5NY6F0", "B001VB8UCW", "B005DGKBDC", "B003BGZ61S", "B0009UC80Q", "B00308B170", "B0007WFY4S", "B002ACKBU0", "B001D2WUDE", "B005DLN1LG", "B003F9LS90", "B00K8HALVI", "B00J9BZ4KC", "B001G0MFP6", "B007R915QK", "B0063FGERO", "B0001WNL2G", "B0035QHXLK", "B00005JO4F", "B0077T5SBS", "B001UHOWYM", "B0053TWVSC", "B00BLF9FYA", "B000FA57U8", "B000QUEQ68", "B005IQGNHK", "B0007WQHFS", "B0096RC57O", "B000CELOV8", "B00005QT9P", "B0077PTWX2", "B00JEZWRE4", "B000067S1G", "B000ASDFIG", "B000MCH5AO", "B00BDZV8ZM", "B00096S480", "B00BMSU950", "B003IRUFCU", "B00EAPC860", "B000GRU09I", "B0038SUBDC", "B0000798EY", "B004WO9OMA", "B000C6NPHC", "B00CD45J52", "B00BUWD7E8", "B004MWLXTY", "B0001ZMWYG", "B00008PW1F", "B000FOPPBA", "B000O77SNG", "B00005JNIS", "B00ARWX2SI", "B001GLFPWK", "B002E58FTW", "B00080ZG2E", "B0028SVY3Y", "B00HQLZCIQ", "B000LXH3SI", "B00DYQ1GBE", "B00JM5C8WM", "B000FUH38C"], "bought_together": ["B0009IW894", "B000FI9OD6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0009IW894", "B00028G7LG", "B000FI9OD6", "B000JLTRFE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 10661}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 15.93, "brand": "WEA", "asin": "B000BVM1TG", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51VCFDJ7X7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Dallas: Season 4"}

{"description": "Kooky, kinetic, and colorful, 2004'sKamikaze Girlsis a delight, and one that could only have come from Japan. Our principal character and narrator is Momoko (Kyoko Fukada), the 17-year-old product of a highly dysfunctional marriage who wishes she'd lived in 18th Century France, during the Rococo age; instead, she and her bonnets and frilly dresses are stuck in Japan's rural outback, where she abides by a philosophy that claims, \"If I can't live independently, I'd rather be a water flea.\" Enter Ichigo (Anna Tsuchiya), a tough-talking, head-butting, scooter-riding thug who doesn't know rococo from rock & roll, and whom the haughty Momoko deplores and mostly ignores--at least until they're brought together by, of all things, embroidery (Momoko's good at it, Ichigo needs some for her biker threads). Suffice it to say that these two oddballs form a union of sorts, andKamikaze Girls(entitledShimotsuma Monogatariin Japanese) ultimately delivers a fairly straightforward message about independence, loneliness, and friendship. But getting there is quite a trip. Director and co-writer Tetsuya Nakashima combines live action, animation, special effects, fourth-wall asides, fantasy sequences, and more in a dazzling onslaught of images; in that way, as well as in its overall outlook (\"Humans are cowards in the face of happiness,\" says one character), the film is somewhat reminiscent ofAmelie.

{"description": "On the surface, David Cronenberg may seem an unlikely candidate to directA History of Violence, but dig deeper and you'll see that he's the right man for the job. As an intellectual seeker of meaning and an avowed believer in Darwinian survival of the fittest, Cronenberg knows that the story of mild-mannered small-town diner proprietor Tom Stall (Viggo Mortensen) is in fact a multilayered examination of inbred human behavior, beginning when Tom's skillful killing of two would-be robbers draws unwanted attention to his idyllic family life in rural Indiana. He's got a loving wife (Maria Bello) and young daughter (Heidi Hayes) who are about to learn things about Tom they hadn't suspected, and a teenage son (Ashton Holmes) who has inherited his father's most prominent survival trait, manifesting itself in ways he never expected. By the time Tom has come into contact with a scarred villain (Ed Harris) and connections that lead him to a half-crazy kingpin (William Hurt, in a spectacular cameo), Cronenberg has plumbed the dark depths of human nature so skillfully thatA History of Violencestands well above the graphic novel that inspired it (indeed, Cronenberg was unaware of the source material behind Josh Olson's chilling adaptation). With hard-hitting violence that's as sudden as it is graphically authentic, this isA History of Violencethat's worthy of serious study and widespread acclaim.--Jeff ShannonOn the DVDOn a single disc and with little fanfare, this DVD makes an excellent case for the best extras of the year. Dive into the one-hour-long documentary and learn more about moviemaking than on many a double-disc. The secret lies in director David Cronenberg's (and his usual crew) folksy casualness in showing off the craft, be it makeup (green screens were used), directing (Cronenberg doesn't storyboard), or art direction (the diner set). It also is very funny to hear about \"fish Fridays\" and how Maria Bello's Uncle Pete became an influence. Even the infamous sex-on-the-staircase scene is diagnosed with candor as stars Viggo Mortensen and Bello act as if there is no backstage camera. There's only one deleted scene, but it's uncommonly deconstructed on why it was filmed and why it was cut (it's a very Cronenbergian dream sequence). A short bit on Cannes is also a delight. So much is here that Cronenberg's smart commentary track is nearly superfluous. Isn't that a nice surprise?--Doug ThomasMore to ExploreThe Graphic NovelOther Graphic Novels that Inspired MoviesDavid Cronenberg EssentialsWhy We Love Maria BelloThe work of Viggo MortensenThe work of William HurtStills fromA History of ViolenceViggo Mortensoe as Tom StallAshton Holmes as Jack Stall and Kyle Schmid as Bobby JordanWilliam Hurt as Richie CusackEd Harris as Carl Fogarty and Viggo Mortensen as Tom StallMaria Bello as Edie StallDirector David Cronenberg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000YENUI6", "B001LRJH0U", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B008R65XP6", "B004SIP8ZM", "B001FB5634", "B0001EFV7C", "B00004W18Z", "B001EIOOWC", "6301971345", "B000M341QE", "B00000K31T", "B000GFLKF8", "B000P0J0D8", "0767802519", "B004SUDQ72", "B003ASLJQS", "B002PJYPYG", "6304698747", "B000F5WR4W", "B003Y5H4R0", "B0018O4YT0", "B00AEBB9CS", "B0028OH568", "B00HOGBXS6", "B00000JDIQ", "B000FUTVLY", "B002AT8KAG", "B000XR9L50", "6305313687", "0783228457", "B002QEHPQU", "B001FB55L2", "B000Y7WGOW", "B002VWNIEA", "B00022XE6S", "B006PTL1QM", "B000P0J0AG", "B004499LX0", "B00005JMOW", "B002T9H2LA", "B001TOD92C", "B005OK721G", "B000FKO5QK", "B0019EXZY4", "B002ZG99N6", "B0007DFJ0G", "B003LR5BD0", "B003RHZ6F2", "B00AEFY5B6", "B000N6TX1I", "0792833279", "B005LAIIJY", "B000FVQM2Y", "B000FC2FX8", "B001BNFRB2", "B00005JN0W", "B002XMGGK6", "B00007E8UI", "B0064NTZQ2", "B00D3DJIG8", "B0010DR4BO", "B0013XZ6X4", "B00AEFXE9U", "B007D5E7C2", "B000ALM40I", "B00001ZWUS", "B00005V9HH", "B00008RH3L", "0783229402", "B000QXDCLK", "B000P0J0EW", "B000BBOUUE", "B000A7DVR2", "B000K7VHQ4", "B00000F4MA", "B000XA5K48", "B00004XPPB", "B0002IQMAM", "B00029LNYQ", "B00003CXWV", "B004XQO90O", "B000GIW9I2", "B004U7MR14", "B002DKGWSE", "B0064MT1FI", "B0000TANUI", "B009T3AE1Y", "B0000VLKVM", "B00006LPGP", "B00005JLRE", "B000F7CMRM", "B00AEFXESQ", "B001DZOC64", "1558908315", "B0036TGTDE", "B000NOKFHQ", "B008220DGE", "B00007AJE1", "B000BVM1S2"], "bought_together": ["B000YENUI6", "B001LRJH0U"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000YENUI6", "B008MILL78", "B009T3AE1Y", "B000M341QE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 45602}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.36, "brand": "Warner Brothers", "asin": "B000CQLZ0Q", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51g0dghsrYL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "A History of Violence (New Line Platinum Series) [DVD]"}
{"description": "A decade after their last hilarious short, the Oscar-winningA Close Shave, Claymation wonders Wallace and Gromit return for a full-length adventure. Daffy scientist Wallace (voiced by Peter Sallis) and his heroic dog Gromit are doing well with their business, Anti-Pesto, a varmint-hunting outfit designed to keep their English town safe from rabbits chomping on prized vegetables. Wallace meets Lady Tottington (Helena Bonham Carter), who appreciates Wallace's humane way of dealing with rabbits (courtesy of the Bun-Vac 6000), and sets up a rivalry with the gun-toting Victor Quartermaine (Ralph Fiennes, enjoying himself more than ever). Creator Nick Park, with co-director/writer Steve Box, delivers a story worthy of the 85-minute running time, although it stretches the act a bit; the formula plays better shorter, but the literally hand-crafted film is a joy to watch. Taking a chapter from classic horror films, a giant were-rabbit is soon on the prowl, and the town is up in arms, what with the annual vegetable contest close at hand. (Anyone who's seen the previous three shorts knows who saves the day.) Never content to do something simply when the extravagant will do, W&G;'s lives are filled with whimsical Rude Goldberg-style devices, and the opening number showcasing their alarm system is pure Aardman Animation at its finest. Even though there's a new twist here--a few mild sight gags aimed at adults--this G-rated film will delight young and old alike as Park, like team Pixar, seems incapable of making anything but an outstanding film.--Doug ThomasSee more clay animation and Wallace &amp; Gromit titles...Director Nick Park on DVDStop-Motion &amp; Clay Animation TitlesWallace &amp; GromitStuff Galore", "related": {"also_bought": ["B006W4KVI4", "B002DPVI0Q", "B001LXIDTK", "B00003CXJ4", "B001LXIDTA", "B001LXIDT0", "B002DR2GJQ", "B000M343BC", "B000W089WO", "B001OC6RZA", "B001F0TT8I", "B004AGN9MG", "B000AA4JNE", "B002ZG4QDE", "B000A2UBOI", "B003BJODIC", "B004KV93AI", "B00005JNQS", "B000H7JCK0", "B0072GOJ48", "B006W4KRRY", "B002WJI2QQ", "B0012EM5D8", "B002D755B2", "B0006JMLRK", "B0000640SC", "B004ZQJ5FQ", "B001DPHDCY", "0783231474", "6305161887", "B000MV9026", "B0034G4P26", "B001ECQ75A", "B0045I3EQA", "B000BITUVG", "B005FNLUFQ", "B000ION23A", "B007Z2DO0E", "B003XEKXWK", "B004HO6I4M", "B001GCUO7A", "B003TJM60G", "B000AY74OG", "B003E66Y84", "B00000JL8E", "B00005JMQZ", "B00009M9BK", "B000DWMYQ8", "B00003CXG7", "B0000AK7AB", "B00029LO0Y", "B0001906W2", "B0006UEVT0", "B00CWM58WY", "B000RMJ4F8", "B002ZG97YM", "B0019BI11E", "B0052MXJ3Q", "B0034G4P1W", "B000MNOX9E", "B004EPZ034", "B00DBVHHDS", "B00I6JOD2S", "B005LAIHW2", "B000IFRT2O", "B005F96UJ6", "1782760326", "B0039N74CW", "B0045ZAQS2", "B000BB1MI2", "B000UVKGPI", "B0030ZIZRC", "B000C3L27U", "B001PR0YEE", "B003UAKE9Y", "B005SDUV4E", "B001HN6918", "B003RHZ6IE", "B001FTIJS0", "B0013FSL3E", "B00CO9N6CY", "B000VBJEEG", "B00009YXAW", "B0015XWUAY", "B00AEFYXD6", "B00007LVCM", "B0034GK74G", "B0042U94UQ", "B00CHVJODE", "B00008G8LM", "B00A8KJK7G", "B000G75AZC", "B00005JN4W", "B000ROAK2W", "B005LAII62", "B00E00OGE2", "B007J3ISKK", "6305123454"], "bought_together": ["B00003CXJ4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0044RFTBA", "B002DPVI0Q", "B00I0VTOMG", "B001LXIDTA"]}, "price": 5.0, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 5628}, "asin": "B000CZ0PT4", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61MzjQMqG%2BL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Wallace &amp; Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit (Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "The latest entry in theHarry Pottersaga could be retitledFast Times at Hogwarts, where finding a date to the winter ball is nearly as terrifying as worrying about Lord Voldemort's return. Thus, the young wizards' entry into puberty (and discovery of the opposite sex) opens up a rich mining field to balance out the dark content in the fourth movie (and the stories are only going to get darker). Mike Newell (Four Weddings and a Funeral) handily takes the directing reins and eases his young cast through awkward growth spurts into true young actors. Harry (Daniel Radcliffe, more sure of himself) has his first girl crush on fellow student Cho Chang (Katie Leung), and has his first big fight with best bud Ron (Rupert Grint). Meanwhile, Ron's underlying romantic tension with Hermione (Emma Watson) comes to a head over the winter ball, and when she makes one of those girl-into-woman Cinderella entrances, the boys' reactions indicate they've all crossed a threshold.But don't worry, there's plenty of wizardry and action inGoblet of Fire. When the deadly Triwizard Tournament is hosted by Hogwarts, Harry finds his name mysteriously submitted (and chosen) to compete against wizards from two neighboring academies, as well as another Hogwarts student. The competition scenes are magnificently shot, with much-improved CGI effects (particularly the underwater challenge). And the climactic confrontation with Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes, in a brilliant bit of casting) is the most thrilling yet.Goblet, the first installment to get a PG-13 rating, contains some violence as well as disturbing images for kids and some barely shrouded references at sexual awakening (Harry's bath scene in particular). The 2 1/2-hour film, lean considering it came from a 734-page book, trims out subplots about house-elves (they're not missed) and gives little screen time to the standard crew of the otherPotterfilms, but adds in more of Britain's finest actors to the cast, such as Brendan Gleeson as Mad-Eye Moody and Miranda Richardson as Rita Skeeter. Michael Gambon, in his second round as Professor Dumbledore, still hasn't brought audiences around to his interpretation of the role he took over after Richard Harris died, but it's a small smudge in an otherwise spotless adaptation.--Ellen A.

{"description": "When Frank Beardsley (Dennis Quaid), a widower of 8 children runs into his high school sweetheart, Helen North (Rene Russo), it&#x92;s as if thirty years never passed! Helen, also a widow with ten kids of her own that include the six she and her husband adopted, feels the attraction as well. It&#x92;s no wonder they rush into marriage without telling their kids. True love can conquer all&#x97;right? Unfortunately for Frank and Helen, the families don&#x92;t mesh quite as easily as the newlyweds had hoped. They probably should have seen the culture clash coming: the disciplined Beardsleys run things by the book; for the energetic and vivacious Norths, there is no book. Helen&#x92;s kids aren&#x92;t pleased about moving and sharing rooms with a bunch of uptight strangers. Frank&#x92;s children have nothing in common with the Norths.

{"description": "The DVD Holy Grail for Liza Minnelli fans finally surfaces after 30-some years:Liza with a \"Z\", a splashy TV special from 1972. And wow, is it ever a product of its era. Minnelli and director-choreographer Bob Fosse were at the top of their popularity in 1972, having just madeCabaret, the blockbuster musical for which both won Oscars.Liza with a \"Z\"places the still-coltish Minnelli on the stage of the Lyceum Theater, in a one-night-only performance covered by Fosse's eight cameras. Songs byCabaretcomposers John Kander and Fred Ebb provide a spine for the show, including a breathless rendition of \"Ring Them Bells\" and the tongue-twisting \"Say Liza (Liza with a 'Z'),\" a goofball number that sounds more like one of Danny Kaye's patter songs than a tune for Liza Minnelli.Liza treats each song as an emotional Mount Everest, never holding back a thing, and the result is a psychodrama played out in the klieg lights. (The outrageous costumes by Halston don't hold back a thing, either; Studio 54, here we come!) Memories of the all-or-nothing style of her mother, Judy Garland, are already heavy in the air by the time Minnelli reaches \"My Mammy,\" and workouts on \"God Bless the Child\" and \"Son of a Preacher Man\" confirm the singer's approach.As for Fosse's choreography, there are signature moves aplenty--his dancing so frequently suggested a choreographer lusting for actual sex to break out on stage. \"Bye Bye Blackbird\" gives Minnelli and her backup dancers a chance to stretch out in an echt-Fosse feast of bowler hats and white gloves. The bell-and-booty shaking in \"Ring Them Bells\" and the loony tuxedo-clad cowpokes in \"I Gotcha\" hint that Fosse was in the midst of a manic phase. Speaking of which, Minnelli tackling Joe Tex's \"I Gotcha\" is one of those jaw-dropping mismatches that she salvages only through dint of daft commitment. No quarreling with theCabaretmedley; say want you want about Liza, she owns those songs. Minnelli and Fosse won Emmys for the show. The restoration of the original materials looks about as good as can be expected, with the spirit of a glitzy seventies TV variety special quite intact.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000H7JCIW", "B009NYF2GQ", "B00007J5VN", "B0000714B8", "B002WHQ9XG", "B00003CX8U", "B000WC39ZY", "B00004W5VC", "B00005UQ8F", "B007LYAYNQ", "B008NNSCYM", "0547553293", "B000EF5MPY", "B009NYF2ES", "B00K6D1S7A", "B000003D64", "B00005U8QP", "B0000714B9", "B0012GMWYI", "B000JGWD32", "B000BP86QY", "B000059QY9", "B002Y4Z54Q", "B000005KOH", "B0001AW07U", "B00KO76FSA", "B003B3V0X4", "B003F1SSG4", "B008SBXFUU", "B001MBTSTA", "B00IZIGFNU", "B00KE3B6NI", "B0000714B6", "B00005JNIU", "B000000PG1", "B008FYZHDS", "B00GBT6364", "B00JM5CAHA", "B000RPBGLA", "B0002OXVDW", "B0033AI4PM", "6305161895", "B00005V9HM", "B00IXD2N1K", "B0000714BA", "B00J2AU8MY", "B002BI4JKG", "B001NKWLD0", "B00J2T18MY", "B000B9PW7G", "B00005U120", "B00452J596", "B00JK5C46E", "B000649YA2", "B00AMQGGSW", "B00H7T56IS", "B008FYZIEQ", "B00BG4R8SG", "B007OAAK0O", "B00H3UKZ6E", "B0032KNA3Y", "B00IBQ5M1W", "B0002Y4TII", "B00BDSRB2S", "B00FN3HRG4", "B000059H73", "B0000BZNDK", "B00GXD6UNO", "B00CQUNSJM", "B004SEUJBE", "B003NF97IU", "B0041FQWF2", "B00000HZFP", "B0062Z0PLG", "B004VJJFDE", "B000056WR0", "B0007WFXZI", "B001G5IJZG", "B004AR4W4O", "B00G0RTYK4", "B000IOM0S8", "B00GXD6UMK", "B0009XFIR8", "B005ZVINFS", "B001LMAKAG", "B0001FR54I", "B003GH6M2O", "B00004RFEZ", "B00BUQV728", "B009Z59782", "0306812843", "B002JT69LE", "6302289033", "B000FG65RQ", "B0081NASLY", "B000007QGL", "B00J2PQZEY", "B000228EGS", "B00FBDJE8K", "B000001E3D"], "bought_together": ["B000H7JCIW", "B009NYF2GQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B009NYF2GQ", "B000H7JCIW", "B0012GMWYI", "B00007J5VN"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 86765}, "categories": [["CDs & Vinyl", "Pop", "Dance Pop"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Pop", "Oldies", "Traditional Pop"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Pop", "Vocal Pop"], ["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 15.99, "brand": "Paramount Pictures", "asin": "B000EBFLHC", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61QQKWVTG2L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Liza With A &quot;Z&quot;"}
{"description": "Any fan of Steve Martin's2000 novellawill enjoy this pitch-perfect adaptation, which glowingly captures the bittersweet tones of a May-December romance. Martin wrote the screenplay and stars as Ray Porter, a button-down 50-something executive who reaches out to a much younger woman as a Los Angeles playmate. The book and movie, though, are both primarily about Mirabelle (Claire Danes), a 20-something with a pile of promises, debt, and depression, as she fades away into a slow corner of Saks selling unneeded formal gloves. She's a wisp of a person, with a cat who doesn&#x92;t love her, and when she finds a suitor, it's Jeremy (Jason Schwartzman), a scruffy artist who babbles on about speakers. When the gentlemanly Porter calls, his appearance in her life begins to make her whole. It also immediately sets her up for sadness--Ray thinks of Mirabella as a precious outlet for sex, while Mirabelle, very mistakenly, sees Ray as a potential lifelong mate. Martin deftly turns the novella's prose into dialogue, allowing the movie to feel full-bodied, and the film also works as a comedy, as we witness Jeremy's growth on the road with a rock band. Schwartzman would walk away with film if not for the perfectly cast leads: Martin does another smart turn away from his wild-and-crazy moniker, Danes has never been better in an Oscar-worthy performance, and Bridgette Wilson-Sampras aces her role as a hot-to-trot co-worker of Mirabelle's. Whoever's decision to have Martin be the omnipresent narrator, though, should be penalized, as it&#x92;s confusing to have him in two roles, and the information is pretty useless, even robbing the film of a final grace note.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000F5FNPC", "B000F6IODE", "B000BYY11Y", "B00079HZUM", "B00008979G", "B000V6LSOA", "B003BZ58RQ", "B005Z9MH7U", "B0012BR8DI", "B0000797IO", "B000VY1EYG", "0786891076", "B000062WWZ", "B00081U7HC", "B00005JMJ4", "B004499LX0", "B00B9ZD73M", "B0016MJ6HY", "B0064MT1FI", "B000EQHXNW", "0767818105", "B00005JMWP", "B000BX8R10", "B0038N9WKU", "B000056BSJ", "1419897543", "B00ADRYCWC", "B004L3AR0K", "B002ONC9NC", "0783227353", "B000NIVJFY", "B00IKM5OCO", "B005Z9MGRG", "6305428239", "B0002KPIQY", "B000CNESJO", "B000035Z3C", "B000EDWKXI", "B0010X8NF0", "078322740X", "B000053VB5", "B00AEFY8MM", "B00007JXWX", "B00FZ4KR4U", "B000BBOUUE", "B001UV4XGU", "0786866586", "B000IU37SO", "0783229402", "B0071HPP3M", "B00IXD2LJY", "B000ADWDFC", "B000GFRI54", "B0000640VJ", "6305308802", "B000067J1O", "B004XVMCKS", "B002T51X4Q", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B0001Z4P2I", "B004XVMCK8", "B000B8QG22", "B003Z8ZC2A", "B001KP2J2G", "B004D45NYC", "B00005JMBQ", "B00AEBB8P6", "B00005JL7Q", "B00007AJE1", "B00BMKGZVA", "B00BEIYGK2", "B000CS45TW", "B00005JMJD", "B00005KHJJ", "B00319ECBK", "B0068MNO2U", "B004LWZWBU", "B0013D8LCC", "B004GJYRA0", "B000LXHK2C", "B002O3Z4ZW", "B001P3SA8K", "B003Y5H574", "B000T988I8", "B002ZFEQ76", "B001URA5Y8", "B002ZG99UE", "B00G3DA5XA", "0767815122", "B001UV4XUG", "B00AEBB9G4", "B00FWSWIUU", "B0001O3YV2", "B00AADAEBW", "B00008972P", "B001MM3AZM", "B00AEFXJ86", "B00A18CG76", "B004H83IG4", "B00803PFWM"], "bought_together": ["B000F6IODE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0786866586", "B00079HZUM", "B007HW18CS", "B002WY65VA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 30533}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.45, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B000EDWKX8", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51vVNaGhmPL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Shopgirl"}

{"description": "What was in the Hatch? The cliffhanger from season one of Lost was answered in its opening sequences, only to launch into more questions as the season progressed. That's right: Just when you say \"Ohhhhh,\" there comes another \"What?\" Thankfully, the show's producers sprinkle answers like tasty morsels throughout the season, ending with a whopper: What caused Oceanic Air Flight 815 to crash in the first place? As the show digs into more revelations about its inhabitant's pasts, it also devotes a good chunk to new characters (Hey, it's an island; you never know who you're going to run into.) First, there are the \"Tailies,\" passengers from the back end of the plane who crashed on the other side of the island. Among them are the wise, God-fearing ex-drug lord Mr. Eko (standout Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje); devoted husband Bernard (Sam Anderson); psychiatrist Libby (Cynthia Watros, whose character has more than one hidden link to the other islanders); and ex-cop Ana Lucia (Michelle Rodriguez), by far the most infuriating character on the show, despite how much the writers tried to incur sympathy with her flashback. Then there are the Others, first introduced when they kidnapped Walt (Malcolm David Kelley) at the end of season one. Brutal and calculating, their agenda only became more complex when one of them (played creepily by Michael Emerson) was held hostage in the hatch and, quite handily, plays mind games on everyone's already frayed nerves. The original cast continues to battle their own skeletons, most notably Locke (Terry O'Quinn), Sun (Yunjin Kim) and Michael (Harold Perrineau), whose obsession with finding Walt takes a dangerous turn. The love triangle between Jack (Matthew Fox), Kate (Evangeline Lilly) and Sawyer (Josh Holloway), which had stalled with Sawyer's departure, heats up again in the second half. Despite the bloating cast size (knocked down by a few by season's end) Lost still does what it does best: explores the psyche of people, about whom \"my life is an open book\" never applies, and cracks into the social dynamics of strangers thrust into Lord of the Flies-esque situations. Is it all a science experiment? A dream? A supernatural pocket in the universe? Likely, any theory will wind up on shaky ground by the season's conclusion. But hey, that's the fun of it. This show was made for DVD, and you can pause and slow-frame to your heart's content. Just try and keep that head-spinning to a minimum.On the DVDCommentaries by various cast members and producers reveal little other than the occasional easter egg (the Dharma logo on the shark fin, Walt's mumbling translating to \"Don't push the button; the button is bad\" backwards). But disc seven opens with an eerie Hanso Foundation instructional video, leading you to eight hours of bonus features, including cast members' own theories, deleted scenes, and featurettes on specific episodes. It's all well and good for Lost fanatics, but if you want the cream of the crop, check out: \"Lost Connections,\" an interactive feature that reveals how all the islanders are actually linked (for instance, one of the officers who captured Sayid during the Gulf War is Kate's father); a Channel UK promo for the show directed by David LaChappelle in which cast members suck in their cheeks and, dressed in evening wear, tango in slow motion as if in a Calvin Klein ad (it has to be a joke, right?); and \"The World According to Sawyer,\" which strings together each of the un-PC nicknames and pop culture references spewed by Holloway's character. Favorites include \"Chewie\" for Jin and \"Ponce de Leon\" for Ana Lucia. It's by far the cherry on top of a sweet dessert. --Ellen A.

{"description": "Even with one episode missing,The Tick vs. Season Oneoffers a dozen good reasons to enjoy one of the wackiest superheroes of all time. From his humble beginnings as an in-house comic book character created by 17-year-old Ben Edlund for a Boston comic shop, the Tick (with his muscular physique, twitching antennae, and form-fitting \"blue tights of justice\") has proven remarkably popular and versatile as a multimedia juggernaut, attracting a global fan base in comics, then this animated series beginning in 1994, and finally as alive-action comedy seriesstarring Patrick Warburton as \"the big blue bug of justice.\" All three of the Tick's incarnations are wildly entertaining, but the animated series comes closest to capturing the unbridled giddiness of Edlund's comics, albeit somewhat sanitized for a Saturday-morning audience of kids and Tick-loving teens and grown-ups. And while episode #11, \"The Tick vs. The Mole Men\" (widely considered to be one of the first season's weakest episodes) is missing here for legal reasons (but may be included in a future DVD release), the 12 episodes included are remarkably consistent in their well-written hilarity of character and plotting. \"The Tick vs. Chairface Chippendale\" is just one example of the series' rogue's gallery of oddball monstrosities (the villain's head is a wooden chair, after all!) and the show's clever writers are always finding inventive ways to incorporate in-jokes, show-biz homage (such as the villainous \"Uncommon Cold,\" who sounds suspiciously like James Mason!), and choice bits of throwaway dialogue that will cause older viewers to burst out laughing.It's regrettable that Buena Vista (i.e., Disney) didn't include any bonus features with this two-disc set (at the very least, the Tick's comic book origins should be acknowledged), and the color and clarity of these episodes varies a bit, from crisp and clean to just a little it fuzzy. But let's face it, the animation (as good as it is) isn't exactly state-of-the-art, and most ofThe Tick's quality is derived from the outrageous cast of characters (including patriotic superheroine American Maid and the Tick's moth-costumed sidekick, Arthur), all of whom reside in a kind of alternate world of hyper-imagination. Perhaps that's whyThe Tickhas proven so enduring as a pop-cultural touchstone of the late 20th century: Whether he's in a comic book, an animated cartoon, or a live-action sitcom, the Tick is just a goofy, lovable, well-meaning reflection of our better selves, eager (as the saying goes) to swat evil on the snout with the rolled-up newspaper of goodness.

{"description": "WithDon't Come Knocking, Wim Wenders revisits territory, both literal and metaphorical, first explored inParis, Texas. Not only does he return to the Southwest, but Sam Shepard is back as co-writer. This time, he's also the star. His Howard Spence is a movie cowboy who's had enough. One day while working in Monument Valley, he takes off his boots and hops a train to Nevada to see his mother (Eva Marie Saint, lovely as ever). Little does he know that Sutter (Tim Roth), a by-the-books bondsman, is hot on his trail. Next, Spence travels to Montana where a sad young woman named Sky (Sarah Polley) is recovering from a recent death, while an angry young man named Earl (Gabriel Mann), who sounds much like Chris Isaak, plies the troubadour trade. Spence doesn't know it yet, but they're the results of a rambunctious past that will soon \"come knocking,\" as it were. While in Butte, he also catches up with Doreen (Jessica Lange), a lover from many moons ago. Clearly,Don't Come Knockingis Wenders and Shepard in a reflective mood, even more so than inParis, Texas, as Spence is older and has more regrets than Harry Dean Stanton's Travis. It doesn't leave as much of an impression, but the film is a worthy addition to the post-modern Western canon. Shot by Franz Lustig, it's frames are filled with intense hues--fiery reds, glowing greens--and a plaintive score by T-Bone Burnett.--Kathleen C.

{"description": "The Stephen King Collection, a box set of four films,Graveyard Shift, The Dead Zone, Silver Bullet, andPet Sematary, is great in that it provides viewers with a full range of King movies, from the truly eerie to the terrible. The set's two finest movies,The Dead Zone, directed by David Cronenberg and starring Christopher Walken, andPet Sematary--arguably King's finest story adapted to film--both come as Special Collector's Editions, with excellent bonus material, including lengthy interviews with both Stephen King and the directors.Pet Sematary, shot in King's home territory, Maine, tells the story of city slickers Rachel and Louis Creed (Denise Crosby, Dale Midkiff), who move to the country to raise their daughter, Ellen, in peace. They learn that they've relocated onto a trucking thoroughfare, and Ellen consequently loses her pet cat. The plot quickly riffs out into mystical, traumatic territory. Louis's neighbor Jud Crandall takes Louis to ancient Indian burial grounds, where the dead are reanimated. The Creeds's zombie cat sparks this Frankenstein-ian adventure, pitting urban settings against rural, and the horrific against the pastoral.Pet Sematarylooks more and more like Hitchcock, thanks to director Mary Lambert's careful attention to detail. The low point in the set isGraveyard Shift, a washed-up story about a cotton factory that's not only infested by carnivorous rats, but also hosts a dragon/pterodactyl. As night-shift employees get continuously munched, Bachman Mills' owner Mr. Warwick is forced to clean up squalid conditions, for which he hires a basement clean-up crew.

{"description": "It&#x92;s amazing what can happen in the theatre. Dramas unfold, epic stories and indelible characters are formed, battles are fought, lovers wooed and spurned, and every once in a while, a play is actually performed. And so Geoffrey Tennant (Paul Gross) is back as the Artistic Director of the New Burbage Theatre Festival for a second season of the backstage machinations and on stage drama that isSlings and Arrows. After a triumphantfirst seasonthat revolved around the staging ofHamlet, season two usesMacbeth, one of Shakespeare&#x92;s most difficult and cursed plays, as the central device for this season&#x92;s plots lines. Things begin close to where they left off in season one. As the last performance ofHamletwinds up a mysterious old woman, in witch-like fashion, practically dares Geoffrey to undertakeMacbeth, and her ominous tone makes it clear it won&#x92;t be easy. The lead actor (Geraint Wyn Davies) engages Geoffrey in a titanic clash of egos, with the ghost of Oliver (Steven Ouimette) continuing to weigh in from beyond the grave. The rest of last season&#x92;s stellar cast returns including Rachel McAdams, leading woman Ellen (Martha Burns), and the excellent Mark McKinney as scheming/bumbling CEO Richard Smith-Jones. The return of guest director Darren Nichols (Don McKellar) to stage a post post-modernRomeo and Julietprovides many of this season&#x92;s best moments, and shows the hilarious side of what happens when artistic imagination and exuberance outpace artistic ability.Slings and Arrowswas conceived as a set of three seasons. Where Season 1 focused on disillusioned youth, Season 2 \"tackles the conflicts of middle age and rebranding,\" said executive producer Niv Fichman. The success of the first season afforded the show a larger budget, and so the original cast returned and a bevy of strong newcomers (including Wyn Davies, Colm Feore, and Diane D&#x92;Aquila) along with enhanced production values, were added. The result is a season that builds upon the high standard set in the first one. The writing continues to be some of the best on television; the characters are intriguing without being precious, and the dialog continues to snap with the kind of wit that ordinary sit-coms painfully lack. You don&#x92;t have to have been in the theatre to get drawn into this world, but if you happen to have been an actor or ever worked on the stage, these characters will be familiar&#x85; some of them probably a little too familiar. It&#x92;s good to see that a strong debut has led to an even stronger continuation.--Daniel Vancini", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000P2A2X8", "B000FBFYKU", "B000XUF6BU", "B0017KP8Y0", "B00A27OJ94", "B00ECR7KX2", "B00BVMXBDO", "B0053O8A46"], "bought_together": ["B000P2A2X8", "B000FBFYKU"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000XUF6BU", "B000FBFYKU"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 107091}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 17.39, "brand": "GROSS,PAUL", "asin": "B000H5U5M6", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51QRWN0PVWL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Slings &amp; Arrows - Season 2"}
{"description": "In addition to spawning the popularNaked Gunmovie franchise,Police Squad!had a lasting impact on TV comedy, and it's still a guilty pleasure. Hot from the success ofAirplane!two years earlier, the ZAZ team (brothers David and Jerry Zucker and writing partner Jim Abrahams) decided to spoof TV cop shows, using the late '50s Lee Marvin seriesM Squadand the popular series format of Quinn Martin Productions (e.g.,The Streets of San Francisco) as their template for supremely silly, gag-laden satire. WithAirplane!star Leslie Nielsen as straight-faced detective Frank Drebin and Alan North as Drebin's befuddled boss, Capt. Ed Hocken, this half-hour series quickly established an irresistible combination of nonstop sight gags, non sequiturs, and repeated routines (\"Cigarette?\" \"Yes, it is\") that dared viewers to pay close attention or miss the laughs if they didn't. Ironically, this very quality--you had to actuallywatchthe show instead of casually listening for punchlines--is what ultimately sealed the series' fate. After only six poorly rated episodes,Police Squad!was canceled without fanfare, and six years passed before Drebin returned as the bumbling hero ofThe Naked Gun.Will all six episodes on one DVD, ZAZ fans can get reacquainted with a series that was arguably ahead of its time. In addition to the rib-tickling disparity between onscreen episode titles and narrated titles, and \"special guest stars\" (including William Shatner, Robert Goulet, Lorne Greene, and others) who get killed in the opening credits, loyal viewers could count on a weekly dose of hilarity from Nielsen, North, and their supporting players. Character actor William Duell appeared each week as shoeshine boy \"Johnny the Snitch,\" capable of answering literallyanyquestion if you repeatedly greased his palm (a gag that led to info-seeking cameo appearances by Dick Clark, Dr. Joyce Brothers, baseball manager Tommy Lasorda, and others). And while originalMission: Impossiblecostar Peter Lupus poked fun at himself as the dim-witted Det. Norberg (later played by O.J. Simpson in theNaked Gunmovies), Ed Williams--an actual high school science teacher--is hilarious as \"Mr. Wizard\"-like lab technician Ted Olson, who dispenses dubious science lessons to unsuspecting children. The fast-paced barrage of humor guaranteed that every episode would deliver as many hits as misses, and while some of the jokes have lost their punch,Police Squad!still delivers the belly-laughs... and always will, as long as humans have an appetite for shameless stupidity.--Jeff ShannonOn the DVDTwo episode commentaries by the Zucker brothers, Jim Abrahams, and producer Robert K. Weiss are good for a laugh, as the ZAZ team laughs at their own material and recalls the rigors of a 5-day shooting schedule, battles with network censors (also outlined in the revealing \"Production Memo Highlights\" feature), and the never-shown \"celebrity guest death\" of John Belushi, who actually died shortly after the gag was filmed. Comedian and writer Robert Wuhl's commentary is more autobiographical and somewhat perfunctory (he barely remembers the episode he wrote), but contains a few nuts-and-bolts details about the show's production. The 10-minute Leslie Nielsen interview shows the gracefully aging star in fine form as he recalls his affinity for the ZAZ brand of humor; the brief gag reel offers about a dozen on-set bloopers (several from crude workprint sources); \"Behind the Freeze Frames\" is an extended outtake to illustrate the elaborately faked \"freeze frame\" gag that ended each episode; and \"Celebrity Death Shots\" is a list of guest-star death gags proposed (and mostly used) for the series. Also included are casting tests for Alan North and Ed Williams, and an animated producers' photo gallery ofPolice Squad!sets, props, and scenery.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AJCUL1C", "B00AMSQBUI", "6305428263", "B00AMSQBRQ", "B005NKIPUO", "B001Q8MMC4", "B0001ZX0O2", "B00005V5NQ", "B000K405CY", "B0006FO578", "B00BTYFWEA", "B00AEFXDAK", "1558908412", "6305268797", "B00LT1JHLW", "B002GOAGYI", "B00AEFXDO6", "B002GSXKPG", "0792166523", "B0000A02TY", "B002GSXKOC", "079073849X", "B00AEFYP3E", "B00LNBQ8SI", "6305840083", "B00LNBQ8UG", "B00AEFYPAC", "B000A6T1KY", "B000F7CMPE", "B00L326LTI", "B00008EY6Q", "0792166493", "B00L9K2EGS", "B0001Z4OXS", "B000PHX5MI", "B000065U1D", "B001666484", "0792844890", "B00441GYQ0", "B000G6BLW4", "B00008972V", "B001E0O8DA", "B0019HQICW", "B001J710YI", "B000G6BLWE", "B000BMY2LU", "B001HUHBBS", "B00C7A8WMO", "B0016MJ6J2", "B006JN87CU", "B00005O06W", "B000FO0AFQ", "B00GT83J1E", "B00E3QJ83C", "B00KSPST6Y", "B006TTC5GS", "B000VUQ4HM", "B00003CXGS", "6549303141", "6304493681", "B00005O3VC", "B000VE439Y", "B000AQ69QS", "B000WC38FA", "B000G6BLGK", "B000O76ZOO", "B00AEFXDGE", "B00319ECGU", "B0010YVCAM", "0783230346", "B00000K3U4", "B000EOOVMA", "B00ECXJBNS", "B003NTUOGU", "B0001S6AQE", "B00J5LXTUI", "B0003JANSW", "B00005JKHX", "B00AO686MY", "0783232063", "B00EALTX8A", "B000RJO564", "B0008JIJ2O", "B007LNBS2I", "B00F77MAO0", "B0053O8A78", "B0017XOF50", "B0000399WD", "B0000DC13R", "B00441GZ2S", "B003H9LIU2", "B00103584Y", "0062069306", "B002DH20Q0", "B00AEBB9U0", "B00K7IPGS6", "B009SQ9Q5M", "B001S86IZE", "B008L0YN18", "B000G6BLRE"], "bought_together": ["B00AMSQBUI", "B00AMSQBRQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AMSQBUI", "B00AJCUL1C", "B00AMSQBRQ", "B0001ZX0O2"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 14064}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 24.36, "brand": "Paramount Home Video", "asin": "B000H7JCFK", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51XCN00YqCL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Police Squad!

{"description": "This Jack Black vehicle seems, on the surface, like a perfect fit for the actor: an opportunity to showcase Black's unique style with the extreme facial gestures and exuberant physicality that have become his forte. Black plays Ignacio, a lowly cook in a monastery in central Mexico who feeds orphans by day, and wrestles in the town square at night. Ignacio teams up with Esqueleto (Hector Jimenez), a street urchin who tormented him, to form a tag-team duo that goes up against the strangest wrestlers Mexico has to offer. Besides doing it for money to feed the orphans, Ignacio is also fighting to win the forbidden affections of Sister Encarnacion (Ana de la Reguera) with predictable difficulty. While the movie has likeable characters and the plot is enjoyable enough, it can&#x92;t overcome its plodding pace and formulaic structure enough to keep the movie interesting throughout. Jack Black is a very strong comedic actor, and the wrestling scenes offer plenty of chances for slapstick, physical comedy, but watching him run around in red briefs and blue tights amounts to half the laughs in the movie, and there&#x92;s just not enough here for him to really work with. When he plays a more well-formed character, as inSchool of RockandHigh Fidelity, his strengths really show. But inNacho Librehe&#x92;s saddled with a caricature. Weighed down by too much low-brow humor and a script that goes nowhere,Nacho Librejust can&#x92;t make full enough use of Black&#x92;s talents to overcome the obstacles.--Daniel Vancini", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00H47IXTC", "B003498RCW", "B00AEFYP3E", "B00AEBB87O", "B00AEFY7YQ", "B001IKKMCW", "B001GPOSYC", "B00AEFYYA8", "B00BG4R476", "B00AEBB9C8", "B004IK30S2", "B000WQWPJQ", "B004SJ0EBE", "B005ERX1UU", "B0018O4YSQ", "B005DZ35TU", "B00AEFXXFU", "B00CXYCBNA", "B00AEFYRVO", "B002KLAL8S", "B00193F304", "B00E9E4F68", "B0062VL4XS", "B00AEFXIQE", "B00E3QJ7FG", "B00CXY9WIM", "B00H7KJTCG", "B004ZJZQ1A", "B00DYEN6XC", "B00HWWUQYY", "B007Q1GJA6", "B000MEYFXW", "B00AEBBAEA", "B00AEFXJNQ", "B001G5T6GC", "B00JL6L4WC", "B00H83EV5W", "B00COHGPQA", "B008V5UQZK", "B003IWZ750", "B008JFUR10", "B008MIMWOO", "B00AEBBAF4", "B004TJ1H0A", "B004047XWU", "B006WZIETG", "B005KQVDH8", "B002ZG97WO", "B0014DFCMS", "B00267QOEQ", "B0021L9ME6", "B001O7JHW0", "B001IKKMD6", "B00AEFXDGE", "B0090SI582", "B004RQDPBE", "B0014BQQZM", "B001KZVQJI", "B0082JRF7C", "B001KEHAHQ", "B000J4P9PI", "B0029XFN8A", "B00CTSDDVO", "B001CW7ZUS", "B00COHGORU", "B00HERGM86", "B0093LE2OC", "B0047685I2", "B00BLN4UDI", "B004RQDYXI", "B00DHHWY9I"], "bought_together": ["B00H47IXTC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001JNNDE2", "B0082JRF7C", "B0054OGQOQ", "B005ERX1UU"]}, "price": 19.95, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 149245}, "asin": "B000HDZK1Y", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51sDOKT8e4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Nacho Libre [Blu-ray]"}
{"description": "Okay, let&#x92;s get one thing straight right off the bat:Family Guyis not, never has been, and never will be,The Simpsons. Nor is itSouth Park,King of the Hill, or any one of a number of other shows on Adult Swim.  But yes, it is in many ways a rip-off of those other shows (especiallyThe Simpsons; let&#x92;s not even pretend otherwise). But so what? By now, you either think the show&#x92;s funny, or you don&#x92;t, and the derivativeness either bothers you, or it doesn&#x92;t. Volume 4 is likely to just cement your feelings one way or the other, because this collection features some of the funniest, and the most offensive material yet. It&#x92;s also  the most cohesive. The show has always been incredibly erratic, turning on a dime to fit in all those jokes from out of the blue that start with Peter saying \"Boy, this is worse than that time when...\"  But by now, the writers and series creator/executive producer Seth MacFarlane have figured out how to more seamlessly integrate them into the show, and that&#x92;s just what it needed to really come together. In fact, the extra attention being paid to the show recently in the form of swipes fromThe Simpsonsand especiallySouth Park(which dedicated an entire episode to trying to kill offFamily Guy) is evidence that this is probably the peak for the series. This volume is 14 episodes, and stand-outs include \"The Courtship of Stewie&#x92;s Father,\" which gives more face time to creepy old man Herbert (brilliantly voiced by Mike Henry), and \"The Father, the Son, and the Holy Fonz,\" in which Peter starts his own church dedicated to Fonzie fromHappy Days. Of course, there is still the lingering question of who the real star ofFamily Guyis: Peter or Stewie? The little football-head gets his moments to shine in \"Sibling Rivalry,\" in which he battles with half-brother Bertram, and... well, pretty much every other episode, as he continues to get many of the memorable lines. Along with the extra features, over 40 deleted scenes, extensive commentaries, and featurettes, you true fans will get more than your share of laughs from this collection, which is what you watch the show for in the first place.--Daniel Vancini", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000AQ68Z0", "B000RO6JZO", "B0012018OE", "B00008YGRV", "B000083C6V", "B001VFM0ZG", "B003DZX46G", "B003L77G9W", "B0058YPMHO", "B00E0FW054", "B000A3DFV8", "B003V3FVQ6", "B00FR81Z40", "B000E6ES9O", "B002HQK5O6", "B0006B41GM", "B000NNK4DM", "B0012KSUTA", "B001RIZ7OI", "B0040JHX0W", "B001N9VW5Y", "B003L77G7Y", "B003CN5B7E", "B0053O8A32", "B002LARYTW", "B003X4KHRG", "B000YOX3HE", "B00LFW6BA0", "B00BYNL8DU", "B00A2JFNSS", "B008412UKA", "B008412UQ4", "B0058RN7KA", "B000ADWCYY", "B007ZFR67I", "B0000CABL2", "B00023P49M", "B00023P49C", "B0001ZWLVU", "B00008YGRS", "B001O0TWXG", "B000FSME2Y", "B002JVWQYG", "B000CNESM6", "B000KLQUMQ", "B0044E9JTG", "B001L1S1PI", "B007KFZ85K", "B000R7I3XC", "B0018O5WUU", "B007KFZ7UQ", "B0024FAR52", "B004MLEYTG", "B000RPD0DC", "B004696M94", "B0006Z2L2Y", "B001RP976A", "B007KFZ7PG", "B000FEBWTE", "B000ERVJNG", "B00158K0V0", "B000067DNE", "B007KFZ7YM", "B0030Y11UG", "B00HDU9UOW", "B000E0OE3K", "B000RW3VDE", "B002LASCJ8", "B000B5XOWU", "B001GQ3GHG", "B009SQ9Q5M", "B007KFZ8B4", "B000KWZ1PC", "B00DTPRZ10", "B006W93ELK", "B008AITJ7O", "B000GETU2E", "B000UZDO62", "B000ZT0S9O", "B003KZ27N0", "B00BI5YEWG", "B007KFZ87S", "B007KFZ88M", "B002C11LCG", "B0024FAR6Q", "B000F48D14", "B007Z3UUF0", "B008OTH56Q", "B0060OKO2O", "B0064ESJ18", "B007KFZ7Q0", "B0072BNK02", "B0019D151K", "B004XVMCH6", "B00GJPUXKC", "B001DZOC78", "B0019CSXAM", "B002N5N4FS", "B005QIOJUI", "B003L77G6U"], "bought_together": ["B000AQ68Z0", "B000RO6JZO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00008YGRV", "B000083C6V", "B000AQ68Z0", "B003L77G9W"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 27839}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 13.7, "brand": "Twentieth Century Fox", "asin": "B000HT3P6U", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GYVSQ1NPL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Family Guy, Volume Four"}
{"description": "Equal partsRomeo and JulietandCrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,Shinobioffers breathtaking cinematography, appealing actors, and ninjas. What more could a movie fan ask for? Released in 2005,Shinobiis set in 17th century Japan, which is dominated by two powerful clans. Oboro is a member of the Iga clan, while her lover Gennosuke is the son of the leader of the Koga clan. Both groups are comprised of expert ninjas who have developed skills unknown to most mortals. When Oboro and Gennosuke meet, they are unaware that by their birthrights, they are meant to hate--not love--each other. When the nefarious Shogun--eager to increase his own power by doing away with both clans--announces that each faction will send in five ninjas to fight to the death, Oboro and Gennosuke are sent in to battle against each other for the honor of their clans. Filled with action (including some computer-generated images to enhance the actors' warrior-like qualities) and romance,Shinobihas the makings of a sweeping epic. Though based on an anime series, the film succeeds as a stand-alone piece of work. Beautifully filmed and well-acted, the film is exciting and heartbreaking, and the viewer senses both hope and doom all the way through the finale.--Jae-Ha Kim", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002BWD74G", "B001AZIRWW", "B004DMIIUU", "B002KYIAKQ", "B0043988KS", "B0019PL2W0", "B006C1S1DY", "B00G3HOJZ6", "B000UAEBFK", "B008XEZXES", "B00B209RHY", "B006H3KQSK", "B001MEJY9G", "B000ICLU7C", "B004XQO8MS", "B0056OZI0W", "B008IG0B0C", "B000MRA592", "B000IMUYM4", "B002C6VMIY", "B0030A6ICG", "B00104AYGK", "B0007Q6VXC", "B009VL2AZM", "B0002ZYE64", "B00065GX0K", "B0016LHH62", "B004SIP88Y", "B000F2CAJ2", "B000E1EHPE", "B008OTTRE4", "B005FQ1OOK", "B004VW4V9E", "B0002Y4T4M", "B00003CXR4", "B009VL2A5M", "B004DMIIO6", "B005F96UHI", "B005F96UGO", "B00B4MMVVY", "B00576U9HQ", "B0012SY0E6", "B000FS9FIK", "B0018PH3NS", "B004H2CXBQ", "B0056OZI0M", "B00B6OEE7O", "B005E7SEZW", "B005M9VSMI", "B00C3ALL9O", "B0002IQHAW", "B001L67A4G", "B00GXFZOYI", "B000EE3FUY", "B008FIPRGG", "B002P7UCJK", "B003DVB7F0", "B00ENTX7JU", "B00009V7OB", "B00DJ5IORY", "B001F34HT6", "B00B1CGFD2", "B006L4MWVE", "B0056OZI16", "B000GBEWNY", "B0033HKDXG", "B0055CP9EK", "B0016MJ6JC", "B008645YLM", "B003YOZNFQ", "B003G715IK", "B000GFLKDU", "B00GS19OOS", "B005ZMBEXU", "B00687XNNK", "B004P2VQZ2", "B0000U0X1Q", "B002KYIAL0", "B0010X740K", "B000MM0LEG", "B0051SFTGQ", "B006MWA91A", "B0010X741O", "B00H47IXJW", "B00011V8JA", "B000P6R9N0", "B0013XZ6RU", "B0009VBTQY", "B0054YCDKM", "B00009RXI6", "B000JVSUXO", "B001R10BDW", "B00518HB4O", "B00518HB0S", "B00FEHCQEC", "B004TFTE9A", "B003LN0NXC", "B0058M0848", "B00HSJ2EMI", "B004KDYR7A"], "bought_together": ["B002BWD74G", "B001AZIRWW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004DMIIUU", "B002KYIAKQ", "B000FS9FIK", "B0043988KS"]}, "price": 9.81, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 87890}, "asin": "B000HXDWOG", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZXJHEFABL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Shinobi - Heart Under Blade"}

{"description": "This clever, funny big-screen adaptation of Lauren Weisberger's best-seller takes some of the snarky bite out of the chick lit book, but smoothes out the characters' boxy edges to make a more satisfying movie. There's no doubtThe Devil Wears Prada belongs to Meryl Streep, who turns in an Oscar&#65533;-worthy (seriously!) strut as the monster editor-in-chief ofRunway, an elite fashion magazine full of size-0, impossibly well-dressed plebes. This makes new second-assistant Andrea (Anne Hathaway), who's smart but an unacceptable size 6, stick out like a sore thumb. Streep has a ball sending her new slave on any whimsical errand, whether it's finding the seventh (unpublished) Harry Potter book or knowing what type she means when she wants \"skirts.\" Though Andrea thumbs her nose at the shallow world of fashion (she's only doing the job to open doors to a position atThe New Yorker someday), she finds herself dually disgusted yet seduced by the perks of the fast life. The film sends a basic message: Make work your priority, and you'll be rich and powerful... and lonely. Any other actress would have turned Miranda into a scenery-chewing Cruella, but Streep's underplayed, brilliant comic timing make her a fascinating, unapologetic character. Adding frills to the movie's fun are Stanley Tucci as Streep's second-in-command, Emily Blunt (My Summer of Love) as the overworked first assistant, Simon Baker as a sexy writer, and breathtaking couture designs any reader ofVogue would salivate over. --Ellen A.

{"description": "Sweet baby Jesus, we thank you for blessing Will Ferrell and Adam McKay with the talent to create a NASCAR comedy as hilarious asTalladega Nights. The so-called \"Ballad of Ricky Bobby\" is hardly flawless  in fact it's not always firing on all cylinders  but with comedy star Ferrell and director McKay still hot from the success of their previous comedy hitAnchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy, most of this 108-minute spoof of oval-track racing is so knee-slappin' funny that you can't help but surrender to the stupidity.Obviously, Ferrell's the shining star, and his portrayal of lead-footed pit-crew-member-turned-#1 NASCAR champion Ricky \"I Wanna Go Fast\" Bobby (how can you not love that name?) is spot-on perfect, righteously spoofing the entirety of NASCAR culture without insulting its oft-ridiculed roots in redneck bootlegging of a bygone era. You could even argue that Talladega Nights is truer to NASCAR than Tom Cruise'sDays of Thunder, and it's certainly more entertaining, especially when you add John C. Reilly as Ricky's life-long pal, teammate, and eventual rival Cal Naughton, Jr. (together they're nicknamed \"Shake 'n Bake\"), and Sacha Baron Cohen (fromDa Ali G ShowandBorat) as gay French \"Formula Un\" driver-turned NASCAR rival Jean Girrard, to a stellar cast including Molly Shannon, Greg Germann, Amy Adams and Michael Clarke Duncan.Sure, it's mostly a showcase for Ferrell's loud, over-the-top antics and nonsensical non sequiturs (like cameo appearances by Elvis Costello and Mos Def), but with Ferrell behind the wheel,Talladega Nightsrolls into victory lane with fuel to spare, and there's one final bit of comedy (with a tip of the hat to William Faulkner) for those who sit through the credits. --Jeff ShannonStills fromTalladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby(click for larger image)More NASCAR andTalladega Nightsat Amazon.comThe CalendarOn blu-rayNASCAR on PSPOur NASCAR StoreNASCAR The Imax ExperienceSpeed, Guts, and GloryBookOther Will Ferrell FilmsAnchor ManElfThe Best of Will FerrellMore Films by Will Ferrell", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000WZEZFY", "B001G5T6H6", "B000HRMCTI", "B0007TS24U", "B0009K7RT8", "B00096S49O", "B000EJ9VDY", "B000KF0GSQ", "B000OVLBFI", "B000AM8RQM", "B000SH3XCM", "B00000G02A", "B001F76PDI", "B000ELL1P8", "B000A6QMQA", "B002EQFXZA", "B000L2125O", "B0009Z3LGQ", "B000ASBKHE", "B0009NSDCK", "B000FIS7HK", "B0007TFLLM", "B0012IWO08", "B002SD94AY", "B003L51GW2", "B0007V46JI", "B000ASDFGS", "B000IFRT5G", "B0008JFMEW", "B000GPVUMG", "B000AQ6904", "B002BSC57U", "B0009VCSXW", "B0008JFMF6", "B000R3BN4M", "B007M6W36Y", "B000BYRCHE", "B0009RCPV6", "B000E1YW04", "B002I0GZBI", "B0009X7BFA", "B000B5IP6U", "B0009KQOME", "B000A0GP5Y", "B000ENUYFE", "B0050JN84Q", "B000BGZRTC", "B003DS4Z6Q", "B001KMRN0M", "B000G8O0MU", "B000EWBKU8", "B0047ERZ7Q", "B000KKRD2S", "B00168PFFK", "B00311G2DY", "B00083G5CG", "B002BS47WG", "B0007Z2556", "B0009FU10U", "B000B8IA4E", "B0045SE9XC", "B000AAJTM0", "B0019C6KAC", "B000F2DE8S", "B0011VPYIK", "B0009350CQ", "B0009NJFPY", "B000ADWD2A", "B000FYZS6M", "B000VIUNZI", "B000AQ690Y", "B0009WPZPY", "B003ALEWKU", "B000F4PDEO", "B000A7Q1XI", "B000803BQM", "B0009K7RTI", "B000MNP2KS", "B000NIBUQW", "B000BKJ76C", "B0013KPSDA", "B007ZH9OFI", "B000059TMB", "B002TPTDFC", "B000A3XYE6", "B00151QYU8", "B000F5GJO6", "B0009VRHME", "B0009W5JAA", "B0009RCPXE", "B000BW7QV8", "B0009NSE42", "B001IZNIVE", "B000BYRCRO", "B000B5IOVQ", "B000B5IOW0", "B00083FZH2"], "bought_together": ["B000WZEZFY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001G5T6GW", "B00H9KKGTO", "B00B65JMEI", "B00AEFXJS6"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 199481}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 19.5, "brand": "Son", "asin": "B000J3OTO6", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51MwbfwtGuL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Talladega Nights - The Ballad of Ricky Bobby [UMD for PSP]"}

{"description": "A remake of the Italian filmL'Ultimo Bacio,The Last Kisswas largely ignored in theaters despite its Gen-X themes and appeal of star Zach Braff (Scrubs), who last made a splash in theaters with his similar twentysomething angst filmGarden State. A drama about midlife crises (mostly for people approaching 30, that is), director Tony Goldwyn (A Walk on the Moon) has assembled a top-notch cast, but there's not enough likeability in the characters to care. Architect Michael (Zach Braff) is a commitmentphobe who wanders into a flirtation with coed Kim (Rachel Bilson) because he's gun-shy about settling down with his perfect girlfriend Jenna (Jacinda Barrett), who's expecting his child. His fellow pals face their own romantic crossroads; one (Michael Weston) desires to settle down with a woman who doesn't love him back; another (Eric Christian Olsen) can't find someone who just wants a meaningless fling like him; and the third (Casey Affleck), ponders leaving his weary wife who's constantly berating his shortcomings as a father. Most depressing is Jenna's mother (Blythe Danner), who's tired of feeling neglected by her stoic husband (Tom Wilkinson). Danner and Wilkinson are compelling as longtime marrieds who've lost their spark, but Braff's character is wholly unlikeable, even aside from his indiscretions. The bright spot is Bilson, in her first movie role, utterly adorable as the sexy college student who's got more parts vulnerability and sass than any stuck in the Other Woman role. There's some fine acting inThe Last Kiss, but not enough character development to care about anything they're going through.The DVD includes a commentary featuring cast members Braff, Barrett, Olsen, Bilson, and director Goldwyn, who all mainly hoot during Olsen's sex scenes and ogle Bilson's seductive dancing. Braff and Goldwyn also imitate Bilson's high-pitched speedchatter throughout, while Barrett educates the cast on the similarities between \"the dingo ate my baby\" and the O.J. Simpson case (don't ask). It's all the more entertaining compared to a separate commentary track with just Goldwyn and Braff, who mostly drones about the music he picked for the film (Remy Zero, Snow Patrol, Aimee Mann) and raves about the minimalist score, done by singer Michael Penn. And oh, they ogle Bilson's dancing in this one too. --Ellen A.

{"description": "It takes a certain kind of comic genius to create a character who is, to quote the classic Sondheim lyric, appealing and appalling. But be forewarned:Boratis not \"something for everyone.\" It arrives as advertised as one of the most outrageous, most offensive, and funniest films in years. Kazakhstan journalist Borat Sagdiyev (Sacha Baron Cohen reprising the popular character from hisDa Ali G Show), leaves his humble village to come to \"U.S. and A\" to film a documentary. After catching an episode ofBaywatchin his New York hotel room, he impulsively scuttles his plans and, accompanied by his fat,hirsute producer (Hardy to his Laurel), proceeds to California to pursue the object of his obsession, Pamela Anderson.Boratis not about how he finds America; it's about how America finds him in a series of increasingly cringe-worthy scenes. Borat, with his '70s mustache, well-worn grey suit, and outrageously backwards attitudes (especially where Jews are concerned) interacts with a cross-section of the populace, catching them, a la Alan Funt onCandid Camera, in the act of being themselves. Early on, an unwitting humor coach advises Borat about various types of jokes. Borat asks if his brother's retardation is a ripe subject for comedy. The coach patiently replies, \"That would not be funny in America.\" NOT! Borat is subversively, bracingly funny. When it comes to exploring uncharted territory of what is and is not appropriate or politically correct, Borat knows no boundaries, as when he brings a fancy dinner with the southern gentry to a halt after returning from the bathroom with a bag of his feces (\"The cultural differences are vast,\" his hostess graciously/patronizingly offers), or turns cheers to boos at a rodeo when he calls for bloodlust against the Iraqis and mangles \"The Star Spangled Banner.\"Success, John F. Kennedy once said, has a thousand fathers. A paternity test onBoratmight reveal traces of Bill Dana's Jose Jimenez, Andy Kaufman, Michael Moore,The Jamie Kennedy Xperiment, andJackass. Some scenes seem to have been staged (a game Anderson, whom Borat confronts at a book signing, was reportedly in on the setup), but others, as the growing litany of lawsuits attests, were not. All too real is Borat's encounter with loutish Southern frat boys who reveal their sexism and racism, and the disturbing moment when he asks a gun store owner what gun he would recommend to \"kill a Jew\" (a Glock automatic is the matter-of-fact reply). Comedy is not pretty, and inBoratit can get downright ugly, as when Borat and his producer get jiggly with it during a nude fight that spills out from their hotel room into the hallway, elevator, lobby and finally, a mortgage brokers association banquet. High-five! --Donald LiebensonOn the DVD\"Global Visitings\" capturesBorat-mania in all its hype and glory, as Sacha Baron Cohen, never breaking character, promotes his film around the world. On the itinerary isLate Night with Conan O'Brienand the Toronto Film Festival, a now-legendary screening aborted after a projector malfunction. A mixed bag of deleted scenes finds Borat trying to bait more unsuspecting citizens, including an animal-control worker who refuses Borat a dog after he asks, \"How do you recommend I cook this?\" and a doctor who is nonplussed by Borat's obscene medical history. A supermarket visit offers the most maddening fromage-inspired looniness since Monty Python's \"Cheese Shop\" sketch. Also good for a few chuckles are a faux soundtrack commercial and aBaywatchparody (\"Sexydangerwatch\").--Donald LiebensonBeyondBoratAll things Sacha Baron CohenBoratApparelBoratSoundtrackStills fromBorat(click for larger image)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002P7UCJ0", "B005LAIHGI", "B0002ZMITY", "B002OID4WM", "B00020X852", "B000A88ESW", "B000WZEZGI", "B001G5T6GW", "B005LAIHHC", "B00AEFZ8OY", "B002P7UCJA", "B00005JNZU", "B001DPHDB0", "B001J9KJ4I", "B00G2P79BU", "B000J4QW8Q", "B00AEFYS2M", "B00005JMYI", "B002Q4VBPQ", "B0006GANPA", "B001OD4S50", "6305922756", "B003XJABTK", "B00AEBBA2C", "B008R65XNS", "B000BKVQS4", "B00AEBB9K0", "B003CRM6PA", "B000A7DVR2", "B00AEBB8FQ", "B0016MOV92", "B000BKJ762", "B00009W5CA", "B000AP04L0", "B008220BGQ", "B002T9H2LA", "B00068WOH8", "0385523467", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00008975Z", "B004SIP95G", "B00003CXZ1", "0783229526", "B002ZG99N6", "B003VPX5Y4", "B002SJIO4A", "B00005JLQN", "B00AEFY854", "B00005O3VC", "B004XVMCH6", "B000K7VHQE", "B0006HBZEW", "B00005JMUA", "B000VE439Y", "B00AEFXDO6", "B000EMGJAO", "B0000A02TZ", "B00005JNBQ", "B003Y5H5B0", "B00BEIYMZ6", "B004SIP8ZM", "B000MCH5RM", "B000K7VHOG", "B00005ALS0", "B001UV4X8S", "B00009MGEM", "B0001Z4OXS", "B000C20VPA", "B0012IWNZY", "B00CE00ZV8", "B00005QCVX", "B000I0RNVQ", "B000022TSW", "B001TOD92C", "B000P0J09M", "B00005JL78", "B00AEFYAMA", "B00AEFXGIY", "B000J4P9P8", "B000055Y0X", "B004EPZ084", "B001VLBDD0", "B00AEFY5B6", "B006XZWAWM", "B00005JKMN", "B00AEFY0F2", "B000XFVIOO", "B002GSXKOW", "B00006G8HR", "B000HT386M", "B000MQCUJG", "B00007AJF7", "B00005KA6V", "B004SIP9MY", "B00AEBBA72", "B00018D42W", "B000TZJBPQ", "B0009HBPN0", "B004P9UWM8"], "bought_together": ["B005LAIHGI", "B002P7UCJ0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005LAIHGI", "B000WZEZGI", "B002OID4WM", "B000TZJBPQ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 15271}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.29, "brand": "COHEN,SACHA BARON", "asin": "B000MMMT9G", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51uGbGa68JL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan"}
