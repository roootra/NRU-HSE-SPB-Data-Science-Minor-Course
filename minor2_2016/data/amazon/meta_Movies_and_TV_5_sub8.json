{"description": "After several excursions into supernatural horror, Dario Argento returned to the homicidal frenzy that made his reputation with this mystery that plays more like a grown-up slasher movie than a detective thriller. Anthony Franciosa stars as Peter Neal, a bestselling horror novelist whose promotional tour in Italy takes a terrible turn when a mysterious killer re-creates the brutal murders from his book with real-life victims.  The first to die are so-called \"deviants,\" Neal's own friends, and finally there comes a promise that the author himself is next on the list.Columboit ain't, but Argento has always been more concerned with style than story and his execution of the crimes is pure cinematic bravura.  From the simple beauty of a straight razor shattering a light bulb (the camera catches the red-hot filament slowly blacking out) to an ambitious crane shot that creeps up and over the sides of a house under siege in a voyeuristic survey that would make Hitchcock proud, Argento turns the art of murder into a stylish spectacle. He even lets his kinkier side show with flashbacks of an adolescent boy and a teasing dominatrix in red stiletto heels that become a key motif of the film. The objects of Argento's homicidal tendencies are traditionally lovely, scantily clad Italian beauties, and with self-deprecating humor he even inserts a scene in which Neal is taken to task for the misogynist violence of his stories--an accusation Argento himself has weathered for years.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305807426", "6305095566", "6304819927", "630580740X", "B00000F6FN", "0764005685", "6304370458", "6300214087", "6303442315", "6300214192", "6302975832", "0764005707", "B00023NRSM", "6304361025", "6301726383", "6305972060", "B001B1Q3LM", "6305498784", "B002E01MHY", "6301708695", "B002UR4GDI", "630191547X", "6303257879", "B000YKI4U4", "B000TZJCN2"], "bought_together": ["6305807426"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 402377}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 29.99, "brand": "", "asin": "0764005693", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51V45XGPZQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Tenebre [VHS]"}
{"description": "Based on the rousing sea adventures in C.S. Forester's novelMr. Midshipman Hornblower, the four-film television seriesHoratio Hornblowerexplores the education of a plucky young officer rising through the ranks of His Majesty's Navy. Ioan Gruffudd is all integrity and honor as the ambitious midshipman who is taken under the stern yet nurturing guidance of Captain Pellew (Robert Lindsay) during the war against France in the French Revolution. Through these four adventures he faces a vindictive senior midshipman (\"The Even Chance\"); meets his hero, a reckless captain whose unorthodox methods are brave but foolhardy (\"The Examination for Lieutenant\"); is captured by the Spanish in a desperate maneuver to sneak through enemy lines (\"The Duchess and the Devil\"); and leads his men to French soil in an ill-planned attempt by French loyalists to start a popular front against the revolution (\"The Frogs and the Lobsters\"). The excellent re-creations of 18th-century vessels and ship-to-ship battles are astounding and reminiscent of such classic Hollywood seafaring adventures asCaptain BloodandThe Sea Hawk, not to mentionCaptain Horatio Hornblower, with Gregory Peck as the only previous screen incarnation of Forester's hero. This mixture of swashbuckling adventure and British naval tradition is leavened with well-placed humor and a cast of colorful characters, but at the heart of the tales is Gruffudd's quick-thinking, courageous Hornblower, a starry-eyed officer with the luck of the gods and the steely determination of an old-fashioned hero.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005B20M", "B0000TWNC4", "6302464889"], "also_viewed": ["B004G8N9VO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 433815}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 4.25, "brand": "A&amp;E", "asin": "0767014812", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51YPGP1NNZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Horatio Hornblower [VHS]"}

{"description": "In the first and finestRoboCopmovie, director Paul Verhoeven combined near-future science fiction with a keen sense of social satire--not to mention enough high-velocity violence to satisfy even the most voracious bloodlust. InStarship Troopers, Verhoeven andRoboCopcowriter Ed Neumeier take inspired cues from Robert Heinlein's classic sci-fi novel to create a special-effects extravaganza that functions on multiple levels of entertainment. The film might be called &quot;Melrose Place in Space,&quot; with its youthful cast of handsome guys and gorgeous women who look like they've been recruited (and in some cases they were) from the cast ofBeverly Hills 90210. Viewers might focus on the incredible, graphically intense action sequences (definitelynotfor children) in which heavily armed forces from Earth go to off-world battle against vast hordes of alien &quot;bugs&quot; bent on planetary conquest. The attacking bugs are marvels of state-of-the-art special-effects technology, and the space battles are nothing short of spectacular. ButStarship Troopersis more than a showcase for high-tech hardware and gigantic, flesh-ripping insects.  Recalling his childhood in Holland during the Nazi occupation, Verhoeven turns this epic adventure into a scathingly funny satire of fascist propaganda, emphasizing Heinlein's underlying warning against the hazards of military conformity and the sickening realities of war. It's an action-packed joy ride if that's all you're looking for, but Verhoeven has a provocative agenda that makesStarship Troopersas smart as it is exciting. The DVD includes an above-average commentary by the director and Neumeier, several deleted scenes, a behind-the-scenes documentary and promotional featurette, cast bios, production notes, and more.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0018CWWA0", "B0001XAOQ6", "B0088X7YMS", "B00D3LA7G0", "B00005N7Z1", "B00070FX5U", "0800195175", "B001ECDVKE", "B00005JA8B", "B00004Y87O", "B0000844I8", "B00008G8LY", "B004P7CN5O", "0441783589", "B00008G8M4", "0780622650", "B00003L9CQ", "B004P7CN7W", "B001JFZ118", "B003XURDAY", "B00I9TDMRM", "B001ILHY1I", "B0002CHK1S", "B00IMYVCGW", "B00000ILDD", "B009YQJ322", "B00000G3PA", "0767817478", "B0088X7YU0", "079284646X", "B000068MC3", "B000P0J09C", "B007STBUHI", "B007D5E7C2", "B004L9GMBC", "B002NZK5U0", "B00026ZG10", "B0045HCJ0S", "B00E8G5HQE", "B00009ATIX", "0783227434", "0780619951", "B000QXDED6", "B00D7AM6M0", "B00006JDVV", "B00AEFY3MC", "B00AEBB8FQ", "B0085A9J18", "B0000959N0", "B004P7CMOQ", "B00005JLQN", "B000RW3VCK", "B0004Z33G4", "B0000UJL96", "B0009JE6G6", "B000JJ4DNW", "B00005JM5B", "B000035Z38", "0767802454", "B0009MDPYM", "B005LAIH54", "B0000AOX0F", "B000VR0570", "B00AEFYDM2", "B00AEFXW8I", "0767802519", "6304711891", "B005G4TJUC", "B00AKGG828", "6305869103", "B0015RCUR8", "B000P0J0AQ", "B008CYDD7I", "0783226837", "B004SIP9Z6", "B002GHHHL0", "B0001VTPW2", "B0009X76XC", "B003J42JLC", "B00003CY6P", "B00000J11D", "B001KKU9DW", "B00AEBB9SM", "B006ZGROB6", "B00AEFXPMG", "1558908846", "B0002V7OI8", "B001VLFE7G", "B0087ZG7HK", "B0000A2ZU1", "B000A5045Q", "B008JFUQZ2", "0800141822", "B000096IAC", "B002ZG98C8", "B001B3LIOC", "B0068FZ0O2", "B000NQRR1G", "B008JFUN50"], "bought_together": ["B0018CWWA0", "B0001XAOQ6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0018CWW9G", "B0088X7YMS", "B00070FX5U", "B0090SI56Y"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 183809}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.55, "brand": "Sony Pictures Home Entertainment", "asin": "0767802659", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51967mHEbrL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Starship Troopers"}

{"description": "Based on a memoir by former undercover cop Joe Pistone (whose daring and unprecedented infiltration of the New York Mob scene earned him a place in the federal witness protection program),Donnie Brascois like a de- romanticized, de-mythologized version ofThe Godfather. It offers an uncommonly detailed, privileged glimpse inside the world of organized crime from the perspective of the little guys at the bottom of Mafia hierarchy rather than from the kingpins at the top.Donnie Brascois not only one of the great modern-day gangster movies to put in the company ofThe Godfatherfilms andGoodFellas, but it is also one of the great undercover police movies--arguably surpassingSerpicoandPrince of the Cityin richness of character, detail, and moral complexity. Donnie (Johnny Depp, a splendid actor) is practically adopted by Lefty Ruggiero (Al Pacino), a gregarious, low-level &quot;made&quot; man who grows to love his young prot&eacute;g&eacute; like a son. (Pacino really sinks into this guy's skin and polyester slacks, and creates his freshest, most fully realized character since his 1970s heyday.) As Donnie acclimates himself to Lefty's world, he distances himself from his wife (a terrific Anne Heche) and family for their own protection. Almost imperceptibly his sense of identity slips away from him. Questioning his own confused loyalties, unable to trust anybody else because he himself is an imposter, Donnie loses his way in a murky and treacherous no-man's land.

{"description": "As \"gigantic monster reptile attacks New York\" movies go, you've got to admit thatGodzilladelivers the goods, although its critical drubbing and box-office disappointment were arguably deserved. It's a shameless, uninspired crowd pleaser that's content to serve up familiar action with the advantage of really fantastic special effects, and if you expect nothing more you'll be one among millions of satisfied customers. There's really no other way to approach it--you just have to accept the fact thatIndependence Daycreators Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin are unapologetic plagiarists, incapable of anything more than mindless spectacle that can play in any cinema in the world without dubbing or subtitles. The whole movie plays out like a series of highlights stolen from previous blockbusters of the 1990s; it's little more than a rehash of theJurassic Parkmovies. The derivative script is so trivial that it's unworthy of comment, apart from a few choice laughs and the casting of Michael Lerner as New York's mayor, whose name is Ebert and who closely resembles a certain well-known movie critic. Perhaps that's a clever hint that this movie's essentially critic-proof. It's stupid but it's fun, and for most audiences that's a fitting definition of mainstream Hollywood entertainment. The widescreen Special Edition DVD includes a wealth of bonus materials--audio commentary by the film's special effects supervisors, a \"making of\" featurette, the Wallflowers' music video \"Heroes,\" a photo gallery, and a variety of features related to this and all the classicGodzillafilms from Japan.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00003CXLS", "B000P24FAE", "B000VXWK86", "B000H30B2C", "B0000VAGXU", "B00066KWCY", "B00I462X7K", "B00003L9CB", "B0001AVZ9Y", "0767825489", "B00I462Y60", "B0000VAGXK", "B0006SGYLK", "B00I099JZK", "B00I462XF2", "B000MV8AJK", "B0088FS1DC", "B009ERJY6G", "B00IE41A9O", "B00AEFYEU8", "B000BMY2L0", "B00K2CHW48", "B00003L9CE", "B00E8G5HQE", "B0002V7OI8", "B00125WAYQ", "0767802497", "B00JB08O76", "B005VU9LO0", "B00008G8M4", "B000E1BXFG", "B001AR0D40", "B000MV8AJU", "B0087ZG7J8", "B007WETMRY", "B000OCY7IU", "6305320950", "B000OCY7IK", "B00125WAYG", "B0087ZG7NO", "B000EHQTZO", "B0093QC3SY", "B001YYQ9S8", "B00B2M7DKA", "B00005A8XX", "B00I099JO6", "B00I3C1T6G", "B00006FD9K", "B007STBUHI", "B002GHHHL0", "B00008WFU4", "B00005R1O7", "B00AEFXPMG", "0783225547", "B00000G3PA", "B00003CXTA", "B00005O5B5", "B0041N72PI", "B00BG4RKL6", "B000OVLBHG", "B0002IQLH6", "B00IQAUO48", "B00IQAUO5C", "B00005JNTI", "B00005JMXX", "B00008WFU5", "B0088FS27C", "B0002B15WY", "B0087ZG7HK", "B0045HCJ0S", "B0024FAG2G", "B000ASATZ8", "B00260HH3K", "B004XVMCN0", "B000F6IOC0", "B00008G8M5", "0780622650", "B000B7MX6Q", "0783231644", "B0068FZ0O2", "B00IQAUO6Q", "B00IQAUO2A", "B00AEFYSR2", "0790738511", "B008JFUPFI", "B00AEFYXQI", "B000R1A0LG", "B000RXVNDI", "B002HTCOCO", "B000056PMU", "B009MF5BXK", "B005G4TJUC", "B0045HCJ9O", "B0006HBZYC", "B000IJ79UW", "B00AEFYUQQ", "B005VU9LKE", "B00IAO618S", "B000BYY11Y", "B000EHSVPK"], "bought_together": ["B000P24FAE", "B000VXWK86"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00003CXLS", "B00K2CHW48", "B0034G4ORC", "B00177YA1K"]}, "price": 6.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 8109}, "asin": "0767817478", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51xvBMPeK6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Godzilla"}
{"description": "Philadelphiawasn't the first movie about AIDS (it followed such worthy independent films asParting GlancesandLongtime Companion), but it was the first Hollywood studio picture to take AIDS as its primary subject. In that sense,Philadelphiais a historically important film. As such, it's worth remembering that director Jonathan Demme (Melvin and Howard,Something Wild,The Silence of the Lambs) wasn't interested in preaching to the converted; he set out to make a film that would connect with a mainstream audience. And he succeeded.Philadelphiawas not only a hit, it also won Oscars for Bruce Springsteen's haunting &quot;The Streets of Philadelphia,&quot; and for Tom Hanks as the gay lawyer Andrew Beckett who is unjustly fired by his firm because he has AIDS. Denzel Washington is another lawyer (functioning as the mainstream-audience surrogate) who reluctantly takes Beckett's case and learns to overcome his misconceptions about the disease, about those who contract it, and about gay people in general. The combined warmth and humanism of Hanks and Demme were absolutely essential to making this picture a success. The cast also features Jason Robards, Antonio Banderas (as Beckett's lover), Joanne Woodward, and Robert Ridgely, and, of course, those Demme regulars Charles Napier, Tracey Walter, and Roger Corman.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B000003KHS", "6301792734"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 602343}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 0.9, "brand": "", "asin": "0767809270", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51PPAS4K30L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Philadelphia [VHS]"}
{"description": "What if you could stop your heart to simulate a temporary death, and then be revived so you could describe your near-death experience to others? The mysteries of life--and the afterlife--compel five medical students (Julia Roberts, Kiefer Sutherland, Kevin Bacon, William Baldwin, Oliver Platt) to experiment with their own mortality, and what they discover has unsettling psychological implications. That's the intriguing premise of this neo-Gothic horror thriller, directed by Joel Schumacher (Batman & Robin) with his typical indulgence of vibrant colours and hyperactive, hallucinogenic style. The movie borders on silliness at times, and the near-death recollection of memories results in some repetitious scenes, but the dynamic young cast takes it all quite seriously, which is what keeps this gaudy thriller on the edge. The fascinating premise could have been made into a better film, but Schumacher's mainstream excess doesn't stop Flatliners from being slick, occasionally even provocative entertainment. --Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303909884"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 725731}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.0, "brand": "", "asin": "0767831322", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/517S5SV68ZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Flatliners [VHS]"}
{"description": "This Collector's Edition has a 10-minute documentary on the making of  the film on VHS and a 45-minute documentary on the DVD. The documentary, however, seems like an afterthought after Columbia's stellar work on theBig ChillCollector's Edition. The interviews with writer-director Lawrence Kasdan and star Kevin Kline were done at the same time, but  there's not the same retrospective feel. Still, some background footage on the building of the Silverado town set and the weapons expert who trained the actors is good stuff for any fan of the film.

{"description": "Director John Singleton (Boyz N the Hood,Rosewood) made an earnest effort in this, his second, film to say a great deal that is true and relevant about living and loving in a violent, difficult time in American history. Janet Jackson plays a beautician and poet who withdraws into herself after her boyfriend is murdered by gangsters. The late Tupac Shakur plays a postman who tries to get through to her, and the two travel on a course through urban America, connecting with family and community. Singleton has so much on his mind that the film comes out a terrible muddle, but there is a certain integrity peeking through the fog. Shakur makes a startlingly good impression in his film debut, and Jackson strips away her star veneer to play something like a real person--and entirely succeeds. Maya Angelou wrote the poems that pass as those penned by Jackson's character, and she also appears in the film.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEFYE08", "B00005JLG1", "B000035P5I", "B002CA68NO", "B00BTYPWDQ", "B00007ELEN", "6305505780", "B00004Y2R1", "B00066FAQW", "B002CA68N4", "B00007BK2R", "1558908390", "B00000JGHV", "B00003CY51", "0780627822", "B0041QSZS8", "B00000JGHO", "B0000YEE6M", "B00005JD5J", "0783230524", "B000FS9ULC", "6305428409", "B004SIP93S", "B0001US5T2", "B00005O06V", "B00066FAVW", "0767811070", "B00005JLON", "B001K98MGE", "B00008977B", "B00007ELEO", "0767813901", "B00006HAYO", "0783240201", "630514415X", "0780627857", "B002GSXKOM", "B0000TWMTS", "B00005JL72", "B00007L4KF", "B00066FAC6", "B00005ASOO", "B000TLOMPE", "B0000JBUHI", "B00124ONGA", "B000HDZKLO", "B00ANDDBBY", "B00AMEZDJW", "6304821832", "B000063RQO", "B00AEBB9AA", "B003UEYBPI", "B000051YMS", "B0000714BU", "B000JRYOPG", "B002CA68MU", "B004P7CMZ0", "B001DJLD12", "B000060MWA", "B00003W8NT", "B00007AJG1", "B00008978S", "B00AEFYAC0", "B00005UQ9I", "B000BOH8X2", "B00005U156", "B00GTS8ECS", "B00005RIX5", "B00465I1CE", "B000XT1P52", "B00AEFY6TW", "B000069DOB", "B00GOZ2LPM", "B000P0J0CE", "B003NH6FY2", "B00AMSNEEY", "B00AEFXP8K", "0783237367", "B00005JD5H", "B001132GNY", "B0042AHOPI", "B003BV8I3Q", "B000LW7REE", "B000069I0E", "B0006H32DO", "B0009PW4F0", "B00007BK2Q", "B00021R7E4", "B00005OW06", "B000093I8L", "B002CA68NE", "B000P0J092", "B003L16FCC", "B00BEL4QFO", "0780631234", "B0008237BO", "B00007BK2S", "B000P0J0CY", "B001P3SA94", "B0002DRDIW"], "bought_together": ["B00AEFYE08", "B00005JLG1"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000BITV9W", "B00BTYPWDQ", "B00005JLG1", "B00AEFYE08"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 22984}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.56, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "0767821955", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51J7FF8G0RL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Poetic Justice"}
{"description": "Director Doug Liman's follow-up to the winningSwingersis a rollicking adventure that, while lacking in any substantial plot, speeds along with nonstop adrenaline and style to burn. Taking a cue fromPulp Fiction, Liman plays tricks with time and overlapping plots, all of which play out in L.A. and Las Vegas in a 24-hour period sometime between Christmas and New Year's. Slacker grocery-store clerk Ronna (Sarah Polley) is trying to score rent money by selling hits of Ecstasy at a rave party, but winds up inadvertently double-crossing a ruthless dealer (sexy and scary Timothy Olyphant). She's also invading the dealing turf of her coworker Simon (Desmond Askew), a Brit on his first trip to Vegas, which turns nightmarish after a jaunt with pal Marcus (Taye Diggs) to a \"gentleman's club\" turns violent. And then there's the two soap-opera actors (Jay Mohr and Scott Wolf) who cross paths with Ronna more than once in their attempts to divest themselves of a drug-related charge by participating in a sting.The way Liman and writer John August layer these stories owes a huge debt to Quentin Tarantino, but the comedy and action sequences rocket like a bat out of hell with energy, humor, and genuine surprise. In addition to some hilarious dialogue exchanges--including a classic scene between Ronna's stoned friend (Nathan Bexton) and a Zen cat--Liman works wonders with one the most winning ensembles in recent memory, a cast that includes both established actors and TV cuties. Mohr, Diggs, and especially Polley (doing a 180 from her turn inThe Sweet Hereafter) are as excellent as you'd expect, but it's Wolf (ofParty of Five) andDawson's Creek's Katie Holmes (as Polley's best bud) who turn in revelatory work; Holmes especially seems poised to be a breakout star. An amazing cinematic ride--like a roller coaster, you'll want to go back again and again.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00BTYPWFE", "B00316DDUO", "B00005JM23", "B004SIPALY", "B00004YMCF", "B0057ZAA6W", "B000K2V7E6", "B00007L4KI", "0767837398", "B00441GYVA", "B002UJIY7A", "B00441GYVK", "B002O3Z4VG", "B0004Z3242", "B0016MJ6T2", "B00005PJ7G", "B00000F0AD", "B000P0J0D8", "B00DW5IKYS", "B00JQF7ZR6", "B0000560PU", "0792840127", "6305594333", "B000QUEQ4K", "0783229526", "B00029RTAI", "B009M4KTUG", "B00005JMX6", "B002NZK5SM", "B000ALM40I", "B00AEFXESQ", "B001RXB4Q8", "B00003CXGA", "B00827OWO8", "B00AEFXUXU", "B00001PE4D", "B002AF4Y9G", "B004P7CN7W", "B000021Y77", "B000YW8RN6", "B0012RLX88", "B004SIP9CO", "B00AEFYZCU", "B00DW5IL92", "B00000JSJC", "B008NA3I30", "0767818024", "B00003CWSX", "B000087F7E", "B0000797IO", "B0001Z52RU", "B000A7LR6Y", "B003TRMLQM", "B00DEKKEPO", "B00005Q4CS", "1558908382", "B0021L8UXA", "0767802519", "B00005T30L", "B004ULEEXY", "B000GGSMC6", "0783235380", "B00008RH3J", "B0008FXT1Y", "B0007DFJ0G", "B0053TWVQ4", "B000XJ5UEY", "B00005U14H", "B00447L4KA", "B00003CWQR", "B00441GZ00", "B004YCKKFK", "B004OUZLGK", "B00000IBL1", "B00AEFXE9U", "B00005JMJG", "B0058ZPNOK", "B000NJWIPI", "B000PHX5MS", "B000F6II1M", "B00BTYJYOY", "B000WC38EQ", "B00FRILRW0", "B000FKO5QK", "B00005JPF3", "B004SIP95G", "B00441GYZ6", "B00007ELER", "B00000JMOD", "B001AIQ14K", "B00008977D", "B00007ELEN", "B000PAAJZ6", "B00049QQHI", "B001GKJ2E8", "B000QXDCLA", "B000CQLZ0Q", "B001152TL6"], "bought_together": ["B00BTYPWFE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00006ADFY", "B00007L4KI", "B000JJ4DNW", "B00003CWOL"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 43107}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.89, "brand": "Generic", "asin": "0767835093", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ycMxpvYQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Go (Special Edition)"}
{"description": "Akira Kurosawa's sequel toYojimbois more lighthearted and less cynical, a rousing adventure with Toshir&ocirc; Mifune reprising his role as the scruffy mercenary who becomes an unlikely big brother to a troupe of nine naive samurai. Shuffling into a secret meeting where the proud young men discuss the graft choking their clan, Mifune's Sanjuro scratches his scraggly beard and distractedly rubs his neck like some common peasant while giving them advice on appearances and truths: \"People aren't what they seem,\" he warns the dubious lads. \"Be careful.\" Naturally they aren't, and Sanjuro grudgingly adopts the well-meaning but hopelessly ill-equipped heroes, giving the starry-eyed youths a series of lessons in real-world honor and respect while saving their skins from reckless attacks and impulsive plans. It isn't the subtlest of Kurosawa's films--the repetitious lessons and speeches delivered to the thickheaded samurai are rather obvious--but it's one of his most entertaining. Mifune, gruffly at ease with the boys, is hilariously discomforted in the presence of a cultured lady, who sees through his shaggy exterior and imparts a little wisdom of her own. Mifune bounds into action in a number of impressive sword fights--wonderfully choreographed lightning-quick battles in which Mifune leaps all over the widescreen image--but an increasing sense of waste, of futility, hangs over the action scenes, culminating in a tense but meaningless duel of honor. The accompanying trailer on the DVD features brief behind-the-scenes glimpses of Kurosawa directing Mifune through an action sequence.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000G8NXYG", "B00005B1ZL", "B001BEK8E2", "B002E01MBA", "B00K5EJHGO", "B00005JLEJ", "B00180R072", "B000AQKUD6", "B000067IY6", "B0007989YS", "B00000K0DM", "B007N5YK10", "B00005JLMU", "B00687XNNK", "6305028699", "B0009WIE2A", "0780021045", "0780021061", "B000ASATM6", "B001WLMOL4", "B000BB14I0", "B000C6NP7M", "B005D0RDPM", "B00004Y7HL", "B000BR6QCI", "B000XPSC0C", "B005JJCMN0", "B0001UZZSG", "B000NOK0H6", "B004XQO8MS", "B002ZG4Q5W", "B006H3KQSK", "B000AQKUGI", "B000056NWP", "B00005QAPH", "B000PC6Z48", "B0017MO0U6", "B0001VO38S", "B00019JR5Y", "B0000B1ODS", "B000E5LEV0", "B00004W3HF", "B00000C0QO", "B00005NC66", "B001PCNZJU", "B000FS9FIK", "B00B2BYXSQ", "B00065GX0K", "B000AQKUG8", "B002BWP4A6", "0792841409", "6305257450", "B003N2CVQ8", "B002AFX53W", "B00000CQJZ", "B004KDYR7A", "B000AQKUC2", "B003KGBISY", "B003VA3JTA", "B00005JLV7", "B003WKL6XA", "B00009V7OB", "6304698798", "B0000A02TW", "B005D0RDCU", "B005152C7S", "B000AQKUH2", "B000WEH74G", "B0007GAG42", "B00AEFYSEA", "B000059TFW", "B008CJ0JS4", "B000FDECGA", "B007Y1NR1W", "B00005UQ7T", "078002205X", "0792839056", "0780020707", "B0080WPADW", "B001LMU1C8", "B00AQ6J64O", "B000025RE7", "B0002V7O0Q", "0783225903", "B001O549G6", "B007K7IAYY", "B004NWPY20", "B000BQ5J18", "B000065V38", "B001LMU1B4", "B00DHN8FXG", "B00065GX64", "B000I8OOG0", "0780022343", "B0049985XW", "B000055Y0X", "B0026VBOJC", "0780022041", "B00GBT62N8", "B00005A8TX"], "bought_together": ["B000G8NXYG", "B001BEK8E2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000K0YM0Y", "B000G8NXYG", "B00008RH1H", "B001BEK8E2"]}, "price": 24.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 185087}, "asin": "0780022491", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51KN3PM18EL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Sanjuro (The Criterion Collection)"}

Forget the tawdry sequels; this highly original, almost surrealist work stars Robert Englund as a mutilated monster who kills teenagers during their dreams.

{"description": "Previously filmed in 1933 (asIsland of Lost Souls) and 1977, the classic H.G. Wells story was filmed again for this graphic 1996 version. The film was roasted by critics, but it's an utterly fascinating failure, largely due to the performances of David Thewlis, Val Kilmer, and especially Marlon Brando in the title role as a mad (and in this case outrageously bizarre) scientist whose experiments in crossbreeding humans with animals have gone terribly awry. Thewlis plays the wayward scholar who is rescued at sea by Kilmer and brought to Moreau's island to discover the doctor's unnatural &quot;children.&quot; Fairuza Balk plays Moreau's half-cat daughter, but it's Brando and Kilmer (in one scene doing a killer Brando impersonation) who steal the show, along with the astounding makeup effects created by Stan Winston. A guilty pleasure by any measure, this movie has definite cult-favorite potential, and in addition to offering a &quot;director's cut&quot; with previously unseen footage, the DVD includes audio commentary by director John Frankenheimer, who replaced the original director on short notice and completed this film under highly stressful conditions.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005K3OB", "B005D0RDKM", "B00005JKLZ", "B00AEFY4IA", "155890848X", "B00003CXIV", "B00GSXE0B8", "B00004ZBVM", "B00HW3EJ6Y", "0486290271", "B003EYVXSW", "B00014X8DG", "B0045HCJ0S", "B00000IBL0", "B00079HZQ6", "B003VRV9DG", "B00IKM5LXG", "B002U4UZSQ", "B008NA3I1W", "B000A2UBN4", "B00CERJI5U", "B000063JDE", "B00IE41A9O", "B000OVLBHG", "B0000AOX0F", "B00004ZBVF", "B003WTO5NO", "B00009PY4I", "B000KHI2FS", "B00AEFXW8I", "0800177029", "B0045HCJSU", "B003L2M584", "B00AEFYXQI", "B00070FX5U", "B004AC6PMG", "6305127646", "B001I04QCO", "B00004W4UB", "B00005O439", "B000QQJ3Q0", "B00022XE6S", "B006WQHP4A", "B00005R2IS", "1619492334", "B004P7CMZ0", "B00004TJJV", "B001ECDVKE", "B00005B6L0", "B0045HCJKS", "B00HEPDGKA", "6305313687", "B002WY64IY", "B0002B15WY", "B0050MB5KM", "630469654X", "B0002IQLH6", "B000BRBA9C", "B00005O06X", "079073639X", "B0024FADD8", "B0051CSIKQ", "B0007RTBA6", "B000HC2LFI", "B000JLQQ94", "B005OT810I", "B000WC389G", "B0018O4YT0", "B0009X76XC", "B000TSIJWY", "B000QFCDGS", "B000U1ZV6W", "B00003CXKM", "B000067J0M", "B000NQRR1Q", "B00008G6E8", "B001DZOC6Y", "B004GSVXA8", "B000068MBS", "B000GBEWRU", "B0045HCJ9O", "B0007R4T1W", "B00J11U54K", "B00003CXCF", "B0006LB5AC", "B00005O5AX", "B0000VCZNE", "B00005RDAI", "B000XT1P4S", "6304712499", "B000E6ESEO", "B001DB6J50", "B002EP8FDI", "B000PFUAP0", "B00000JPH6", "B000A2IPQY", "B000B6CO3Y", "B004P7CN7W", "B000IJ7A5Q"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005K3OB", "B000HT38E4", "0486290271", "B00HEPDGKA"]}, "price": 15.52, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 16728}, "asin": "0780619951", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51QSKY0A5ZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Island of Dr. Moreau (Unrated Director's Cut)"}

{"description": "Edward Norton was nominated for a 1998 Best Actor Oscar for his role as  Derek Vinyard, a thoughtful kid turned neo-Nazi after his father is slain.  Edward Furlong plays his younger brother, Danny, determined to follow in his brother's footsteps.  The easy routes the film seems prepared to take never materialize.  It continually makes Derek's transformation both in and out of his racist beliefs believable and persuasive.  Stacy Keach is given the head vampire role of the local skinhead chapter, Cameron, and he's the closest this film comes to an overt overstatement.  Norton, however, is fantastic, embodying a person who roller-coasters through hatred like he can't wait to ride again.  His diatribes are not unlike what can be heard on any given conservative radio station on any given day, but he doesn't spew them as cant or screed.  Only when his violent emotions take charge, negating any sense or stand, is the underlying fallacy and nature of his beliefs made plain. This film was undermined by the film's own director, Tony Kaye, who made such a braying ass of himself and his work that it distorted the public's view of what is an interesting social and psychological lesson in the war between ideas and ideologues, reason and racism.--Keith Simanton", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303686796", "B00004W5UA", "B00000J2L7"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 321982}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.59, "brand": "", "asin": "0780625129", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516KFV9DGKL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "American History X [VHS]"}

{"description": "In the vastly overrated 1998 bookEasy Riders, Raging Bulls, author Peter Biskind puts the blame for Hollywood's blockbuster mentality at least partially on Steven Spielberg's box-office success with this adaptation of Peter Benchley's bestselling novel. But you can't blame Spielberg for making a terrific movie, whichJawsdefinitely is. The story of a Long Island town whose summer tourist business is suddenly threatened by great-white-shark attacks on humans bypasses the potboiler trappings of Benchley's book and goes straight for the jugular with beautifully crafted, crowd-pleasing sequences of action and suspense supported by a trio of terrific performances by Roy Scheider (as the local sheriff), Richard Dreyfuss (as a shark specialist), and particularly Robert Shaw (as the old fisherman who offers to hunt the shark down). The sequences on Shaw's boat--as the three of them realize that in fact the shark is huntingthem--are what entertaining moviemaking is all about.--Marshall Fine", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005B6ND", "6300183181", "0784011923", "0767825411", "6305814694", "B00000JGEI", "6303148352", "6303506291", "630018403X", "B00000490M", "6300214753", "6304932553", "630442972X", "6300269639", "B0000048S1", "B000005PFL", "6302765536", "6302091632", "6302824729", "6303344224", "6301570723", "6300247171", "B00008WFU5", "6305576173", "6300183467", "0790743213", "6304143184", "6303402348", "1558808221", "6303020089", "B000063UUL", "B00005B238", "6303212379", "B00005A8XX", "0790731436", "0783226152", "0790705141", "6300267881", "B00008WFU4", "6300181340", "630157401X", "6302921058", "6300214060", "6302968143", "1558802258", "0792102320", "6300214087", "6300268993", "B0000BWVBD", "B002GHHHL0", "6301888901", "B00005JKDQ", "6303122647", "6302800420", "6303610811", "6301827732", "6303540082", "6302374189", "0800198395", "6300214435", "6304071876", "6301208773", "B00000IO4G", "B00006G8LB", "B0087ZG7HK", "B00008DZ83", "6300214710", "6300215814", "630220366X", "6304457324", "0800116917", "B000059XY5", "6303212263", "6300216500", "6303236863", "630533577X", "6300213986", "6302415853", "6304935811", "6302820448", "B00004U8P4", "6300214311", "6301798503", "0793927501", "6300214370", "6302787564", "6304288433", "6300182878", "B000003KHS", "6301971809", "B000007OY0", "0790734079", "630336568X", "0790733927", "0790742322", "6301966988", "0764006770", "B000059XVO", "B00023BLXA"], "also_viewed": ["B00008WFU5", "6301792734", "6305814694", "B00005B6ND", "0784011923", "0767825411", "6300214060", "6300183181", "6300247171", "B00005A8XX", "6303506291", "B00006AL1C", "0792151712", "6304539258", "630018403X", "6305363668", "B00008WFU4", "B00000JGEI", "B00078XGO2", "6304117752", "6301574117", "0800116917", "B000005PPB", "B0056BE0SG", "6302091632", "080010367X", "6304143184", "6300216845", "6304539274", "6303148352", "0792158261", "B00000JS61", "0792839846", "6303212379", "0792837614", "0783222955", "0783221347", "0790700506", "6302921058", "6301797906", "6301976983", "6305123616", "6303402070", "6304429274", "1558807780", "B00005JKDQ", "6300214370", "6302936381", "B00000JGEK", "B0000AQZYM", "B00000JXVM", "B0007KTBIU", "0790734079", "6304039522", "6300214753", "B00005NCCP", "B005FHWWXQ", "B0087F7VSY", "B00KDU8HQQ"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 177995}, "asin": "0783216084", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514JQY1K3TL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Jaws [VHS]"}

{"description": "After the global phenomenon that wasJurassic Park, it was a given that novelist Michael Crichton would conjure up a sequel and that Steven Spielberg would then commit it to film. Considering the potential profit involved, it was practically a commercial mandate. Perhaps it was inevitable that both efforts were contrived, and well below the talents of Crichton (well, maybe) and certainly Spielberg, who just didn't have the heart for this recycling after the artistic triumph ofSchindler's List. What we're left with, for better and worse, is a redundant blockbuster that still benefits from Spielberg's mastery of high-intensity action sequences and the further development of amazing computer-generated special effects. What's missing is the awe and wonder that madeJurassic Parka technical marvel and a dazzling product of scientific imagination. The story's a no-brainer: after the deadly fiasco of the original dinosaur theme park, we're taken (along with returning star Jeff Goldblum) to a second island where genetically engineered dinosaurs still thrive under the watchful eye of Goldblum's biologist girlfriend (Julianne Moore). But a devious capitalist (Arliss Howard) is determined to export dinosaurs to a new park in San Diego, financing a hunt-and-capture expedition that results in another series of fatal disasters. In Spielberg's hands this movie's more exciting than it has a right to be, given the creative paucity of Crichton's novel and David Koepp's adapted screenplay. The special effects are state-of-the-art, and the T-Rex's rampage through the streets of San Diego is nothing short of spectacular; but apparently an improvement upon the shortcomings ofJurassic Parkwas too much to hope for.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00003CXXR", "6303148352", "0788805533", "6301666569", "6304290888", "6303506291", "0783216084", "6304169558", "6303212379", "B0000524CZ", "B0000048S1", "B00006FDFG", "6304155972", "0788811002"], "bought_together": ["B00003CXXR", "6303148352"], "also_viewed": ["B00B4804KS", "B0087ZG7J8", "6303148352", "B0057R5XRG", "B00003CXXR", "0788812408", "078881172X", "080010367X", "6304015127", "630157401X", "6303486894", "B00000JGEI", "630021463X", "6303215734", "6300215830", "6302320402", "6304089767", "6305750750", "B00005JM5E", "6303314015", "6302642248", "B000LPS4BG", "079213690X", "B008M4MB8K", "B007LNBS2I", "B00HWWUQWQ"]}, "price": 25.93, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 670881}, "asin": "0783223358", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51FZH56FA4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Lost World: Jurassic Park [VHS]"}
{"description": "The second film in Oliver Stone's Vietnam trilogy moves from the brutality of war inPlatoonto its equally traumatic aftermath. Based on the memoir of combat veteran Ron Kovic, the film stars Tom Cruise as Kovic, whose gunshot wound in Vietnam left him paralyzed from the chest down. He is deeply embittered by neglect in a veteran's hospital and by the shattering of his patriotic idealism because of the horror and futility of the Vietnam conflict. While painfully and awkwardly adjusting to his disability and a changing definition of masculinity, Kovic joins the burgeoning movement of antiwar protest, culminating in a climactic appearance at the 1976 Democratic national convention. A powerfully intimate portrait that unfolds on an epic scale,Born on the Fourth of Julyis arguably Stone's best film (if you can forgive its often strident tone), and Cruise's Oscar-nominated role is uncompromising in its depiction of one man's personal anguish and political awakening.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["079284646X", "B006TTC5HC", "B0015D20FE", "B000ELL1R6", "B000B8QG22", "B000P0J09C", "B00031V21M", "B00005V9HI", "B003ELKNH2", "B004FQX59I", "B00AEBBA36", "B00AEFXR1K", "B000GAKDAG", "B00000IQC0", "B00005JN2Z", "B0018QPPXW", "B00AEBB86U", "B000065V3G", "B000035Z5G", "1888451785", "B00005PJ8T", "B00001ZWUS", "B00005B6JZ", "B0013FCWUW", "B0000YEEGM", "B000M4RG42", "B000RTB0R6", "B00AEFY0F2", "B004U7MR1Y", "0800141741", "0783226810", "B00AEBB9LO", "B000E1NXJ0", "B00005JA9F", "B00275EGWY", "B003ASLJOU", "B001TUZG4K", "B00005JNTI", "B002OGMGV4", "B000CEXEWA", "0767830555", "B0002WZTOI", "B000EHSVS2", "B00AEFXYJA", "B00B0U2SFE", "B00004RF82", "B00080ZG10", "B00005JK8K", "B004FQX5B6", "B000059TFO", "B000065U1N", "B00008G8M4", "B000KGGJ0Y", "B0000542CI", "B000O599YO", "B000G6BLHY", "B003BV8I3Q", "B00005J760", "0800141806", "B004SIP7ZS", "B002O3Z4Z2", "B00005N5S2", "B0006GAOJA", "B000P0J09M", "B001MVWFAO", "B00AEBB95K", "B000C20VPA", "B0043X1FL8", "B000U788WU", "0767817745", "B003ASLJQI", "B004SIP7TE", "B00G4Q3KOC", "B000BRP4BM", "B000FVQLQQ", "B000CNESTE", "B00005JPKE", "B0004Z33EG", "B00000K0DQ", "B000GG4Y32", "B00005JL78", "B000059HAN", "6305428522", "B004AOECXI", "B000PAAJZ6", "B001TH92N4", "B000ZM1MGE", "B00BTYJYR6", "0783225733", "B0006GANN2", "0767836359", "B00008CMRK", "B004GJYRI2", "B003HKN52U", "0800177967", "B000FVQLRA", "B00011CZRE", "B00009W5CA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["079284646X", "B00001ZWUS", "B006TTC5HC", "B000B8QG22"]}, "price": 8.48, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 263904}, "asin": "0783226764", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510WBGNCT9L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Born on the Fourth of July"}

{"description": "A movie that only true horror buffs could love,Army of Darknessis officially part 3 in the wild and wacky Evil Dead trilogy masterminded by the perversely inventive director Sam Raimi, who would later serve as executive producer of the popular syndicated TV seriesHercules: The Legendary Journeys.Raimi's favorite actor, Bruce Campbell, returns as Ash (hero of the first two Evil Dead flicks), a hardware-store clerk who is magically transported--along with his beat-up Oldsmobile and a chainsaw attachment for his severed left forearm--to the brutal battlefields of the 14th century. He quickly assumes power (who else in the Middle Ages packs a shotgun and a chainsaw?), and unites his band of medieval knights against the dreaded Army of the Dead. Raimi gleefully subverts almost every horror-movie clich&eacute; as he serves up a nonstop parade of blood, gore, and vicious sword-bearing skeletons--an affectionate homage to animator Ray Harryhausen's classicJason and the Argonauts. The frantic action is fun while it lasts, but even at 80 minutesArmy of Darknessnearly wears out its welcome.

{"description": "Yet another potent (although critically underrated) drama from Jim Sheridan and Daniel Day-Lewis, the Irish director and British star (respectively) ofMy Left FootandIn the Name of the Father. The story focuses on Danny Flynn (Day-Lewis), a promising boxer who had been imprisoned at age 18 for associating with IRA terrorists. After serving a 14-year sentence, he returns to his Belfast neighborhood at a time when local IRA leader Joe Hamill (Brian Cox) is attempting to negotiate a peace treaty with the British. Despite having no further interest in IRA rivalries, Danny finds himself at the center of political and emotional turmoil when he is reunited with his former girlfriend Maggie (Emily Watson, ofBreaking the Waves) who, in Danny's absence, married another IRA man who is now in prison. A strict, unwritten law forbids relationships with the wives of IRA prisoners, but as the former boxer channels his energy into reviving a neighborhood boxing gym, the attraction between Danny and Maggie proves irresistible. This gives a strategic advantage to a militant IRA rival who opposes the peace treaty, drawing Danny back into the bitter and potentially deadly struggle between warring IRA factions. Emphasizing the emotional complexities that arise between Danny and Maggie, this powerful, superbly acted drama demonstrates a sharp understanding of the deep-rooted fears and loyalties that fuel the &quot;troubles&quot; in Ireland, where peace seemed to finally (if tentatively) be achieved in the summer of 1998.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["630310360X"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 468133}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.49, "brand": "", "asin": "0783227280", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51WD28B954L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Boxer [VHS]"}
{"description": "Director John Carpenter and special makeup effects master Rob Bottin teamed up for this 1982 remake of the 1951 science fiction classicThe Thing from Another World, and the result is a mixed blessing. It's got moments of highly effective terror and spine-tingling suspense, but it's mostly a showcase for some of the goriest and most horrifically grotesque makeup effects ever created for a movie. With such highlights as a dog that splits open and blossoms into something indescribably gruesome, this is the kind of movie for die-hard horror fans and anyone who slows down to stare at fatal traffic accidents. On those terms, however, it's hard not to be impressed by the movie's wild and wacky freak show. It all begins when scientists at an arctic research station discover an alien spacecraft under the thick ice, and thaw out the alien body found aboard. What they don't know is that the alien can assume any human form, and before long the scientists can't tell who's real and who's a deadly alien threat. Kurt Russell leads the battle against the terrifying intruder, and the supporting cast includes Richard Masur, Richard Dysart, Donald Moffat, and Wilford Brimley. They're all playing standard characters who are neglected by the mechanistic screenplay (based on the classic sci-fi story \"Who Goes There?\" by John W. Campbell), but Carpenter's emphasis is clearly on the gross-out effects and escalating tension.

{"description": "WhenHavanawas released in 1990, a lot of reviewers unfavorably compared it toCasablanca, and those comparisons (in addition to audience indifference) turned the film into a box-office disaster. It deserved a better fate, because, while this is certainly no masterpiece, it's an intelligent and lavishly produced film about a chapter of history--the final days of Cuba under the collapsing Batista regime--that remains largely unfamiliar to the American mainstream. It's a compelling political backdrop for the story of a high-stakes gambler (Robert Redford) who comes to Cuba seeking the big score in poker games, following his expectation that high rollers will bet wildly as the Cuban government crashes around their heads. In Havana, Redford meets the wife (Lena Olin) of a Communist revolutionary (Raul Julia) with ties to Fidel Castro, and their attraction becomes powerfully mutual after her husband is presumed killed by Cuban police. What follows, as Cuba falls and Redford's character is forced into a crisis of conscience, is a mini-epic love story with tragic overtones, handled with great skill (albeit lagging pace) by long-time Redford collaborator Sydney Pollack. True, it's not nearly as memorable asCasablanca, but this is a worthwhile film, especially if you're interested in the political upheavals in pre-Castro Cuba.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005V9HJ", "B000C3L2PC", "B001LMAK6A", "B00005ALS5", "6305428034", "B00008MTW1", "B00008MTVY", "B0002XVKLS", "B000087F6M", "B00008OE4W", "B00AEBB9EG", "B0000001O9", "B0009S4IGU", "B00005JKNV", "B00008CMSX", "B004SEUJOQ", "B00BEIYKX0", "B00005JKBC", "B00AMSS3XQ", "B0013FCWUW", "B0013N2WFY", "B0000AUHQA", "B00DW5IK9S", "B00001W9G0", "6305128952", "B00002SWEM", "B001QX014A", "B002M36R1Y", "0783240171", "B000MNOX94", "B000SLYE6M", "B003L16F7C", "B00AKGG5WG", "6304696507", "B000087F7R", "B007ATC3RC", "B00008PC12", "1423603672", "B00AEFY66U", "B00GST8U4U", "B00AMSTXSU", "B00066FBQG", "B000021Y7L", "B007N31YH0", "B00014X8DG", "B0033PSHA4", "B000RHRGSK", "3866093594", "B0045HCJIK", "B004LWZVZC", "B00005UM2X", "0767836359", "B005Z9MH02", "1598805282", "B00007K02E", "B00AEFYD9K", "B00AEBB9N2", "0199896704", "B001EOQCJE", "B008XAT1BI", "B00IBKXSKA", "B000244GCW", "B00005Y1UX", "B000CEXEWA", "B00005U2KC", "B00H9KKGTO", "B00CZB9BE8", "B00G7QPUII", "B00AEFYSWM", "B0001FVDI2", "B00AEFY9YY", "B00008CMRK", "B00405DUZI", "1579128548", "B0045HCJTO", "B0051HCVEU", "B0007QJ210", "B000UEE6TC", "B004SUDQ8G", "B000B8GT92", "B000EBD9U8", "B0036TGT8Y", "B000YNFXQO", "B0030BOCFU", "B00BTYRB58", "B00CEJ1JB4", "B008JFUNKU", "B00005J760", "B00066FB52", "B0039A9M7K", "0061712744", "B00002E20R", "B0009GX1CE", "B00AEFXN9G", "B008B9JTFO", "B00005JNCZ", "B0000549AP", "B00GUO2SKA", "1580932754", "B00006L91I"], "bought_together": ["B000C3L2PC", "B00005V9HJ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000C3L2PC", "B00005V9HJ", "B00005JKBC", "B004SEUJOQ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 37614}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.68, "brand": "UNIVERSAL", "asin": "0783229429", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51O2KVbfRYL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Havana"}

{"description": "Arnold Schwarzenegger as a pregnant man? The Terminator with cramps and morning sickness? That was  all the teasing audiences needed to flock to this 1994 farce, which reunited Arnold with his director and costar fromTwins, Ivan Reitman and Danny De&nbsp;Vito. Reitman had also directed the Austrian muscleman inKindergarten Cop, and they brought the same breezy quality of those earlier films to this enjoyable fluff, in  which Arnold plays a scientist who uses his own body to test a revolutionary new fertility drug. His colleague De Vito  talks him into the experiment, which succeeds beyond their wildest expectations when Arnold begins a full-term  pregnancy. Emma Thompson offers a wealth of comedic support as the biologist who moves into Schwarzenegger's lab  while he's coping with his \"maternal\" condition, and Pamela Reed (who was also inKindergarten Cop) adds to  the fun as De&nbsp;Vito's pregnant ex-wife. What's surprising about this mainstream hit is not that it makes the most of  its absurd premise, but that it's also sweetly heartwarming in its treatment of role reversal and the joys and pains of  pregnancy. It's a good-natured vehicle for a different side of Schwarzenegger's star appeal, and the fact that it works at  all is a tribute to Reitman and his cleverly talented cast.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783226926", "0783225504", "B00005T7I2", "B0002J58HO", "6305767866", "B000056PMU", "B00013RC8E", "0767804309", "B000TJBN6W", "B00005T7I3", "B00004XMSC", "B00026ZG10", "B005XB8SRS", "B0001Z37HM", "B000068QPM", "B002GHHHME", "B00HZMZ2FE", "B000Y11B7Q", "B00005JKIP", "0783225946", "B001LMAK9C", "B00AKGG828", "6305803781", "B0000VD12I", "B00005T7HZ", "B000RJO56E", "B00008979F", "B000RW3VCK", "B00005N5S5", "B00000IQW2", "B00008977A", "B00070FX5U", "B000089771", "B00JVLGL2A", "B00AEFXPG2", "B0087ZG7NO", "B0000542C9", "B000063INF", "B00K8HALVI", "0767802497", "B00AMEZDN8", "B0000VV5BM", "0783241895", "B00386EZKE", "B00K8HAKSW", "0800177029", "B00018YC3M", "B00008L3S9", "B001VLBDD0", "B00HSSZKAW", "6305236569", "0783235070", "6305213305", "B008KEQMDC", "B000QQLVPQ", "B001OST0M6", "B000FC2FQA", "B00081U7HC", "1558908404", "B00020HAXI", "B00006AW63", "B00AEBB9WI", "B0006J28MI", "6305428395", "B00441GYQ0", "B00HLTD49C", "B002XUBDRY", "B00HQOFAKI", "B000E6ESI0", "0767807588", "0783226896", "B000TZJBPQ", "B0006GANOQ", "0783227396", "B00441GYY2", "B000IJ79X4", "B001G7Q0M8", "0767821769", "B000BUE5E6", "B001TK80C0", "B00BTYJYP8", "B001L2ZSJO", "B00008L3U1", "B007R915RE", "B0007GGYUC", "B001CQONNG", "B004X1M47O", "6305428549", "B0000DKDUV", "B000065V43", "B0009UZG3C", "B00009AOBM", "B004X1M3DE", "B000068MC1", "B000BPL2FQ", "0792844866", "B00008G8LY", "B00H1RMWYW", "B003UESJEW", "B002LFAHBE"], "bought_together": ["0783226926", "0783225504"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000RJO56E", "0783225504", "0783226926", "0800177975"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 46614}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.99, "brand": "UNIVERSAL", "asin": "0783230370", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51VBRQ7VGVL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Junior"}
{"description": "Anyone who has seen and loved Neil Jordan'sThe Company of Wolvesshould feel  right at home in his off-beat psychological thrillerIn Dreams. A sexy, very  adult take on \"Little Red Riding Hood,\"Wolvesunreeled as a series of  surreal \"fairy tales\" interwoven within the heated dreams of a young girl  verging on womanhood.Wolves' patron saints were Freud and Jung (as sifted  through Jordan's wickedly fertile imagination), and the duo are very much aboard forIn Dreamsas well.  Here's a movie that takes place entirely in dreamtime,  where the dark, violent fantasies of Claire Cooper (Annette Bening)--wife,  mother, and illustrator of children's books--play out unpoliced by superego,  conscience, or society. On the face of it, Claire's a clairvoyant whose mind  becomes more and more possessed by child-killer Vivian Thompson (Robert  Downey Jr.). Cops and shrinks refuse to take her seriously until she loses  her own daughter and much, much more. Tapping into weird images of her  soulmate's childhood, when he was abused by a hateful mother in a house now submerged in a nearby reservoir, Claire comes closer and closer to her  gender-shifting bad boy (and his latest victim). From start to finish,In  Dreamsdwells in hyperreality. Whether leeched of or drenched in color, slipping eerily through an underwater world, rushing madly toward  catastrophe--every hallucinatory shot is saturated with menace. It's the kind  of potent, unresolved menace that haunts your waking day after a particularly  unsettling nightmare. Watch this gorgeous film as therapeutic (?) theater  inside Claire's mind, where she and her murderous doppelganger act out a  terrible Oedipal drama driven by sex and jealousy. Bening and Downey deliver  superb, risky performances, and Darius Khondji's cinematography, with almost  every frame punctuated by blood-reds, is sensuously dreamlike.In Dreamsis  one of those great, flawed films that reaches for more than it ultimately  achieves. But what a welcome change from the dullness and shallowness of the  formulaic sure things that dominate movie screens as the 20th century draws to a close.--Kathleen Murphy", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0001FR3IQ", "B004YCKJNI", "B000NO1XG8", "B0000DD76U", "B000KB489I", "B00064AFK0", "B0071HPP1Y", "B00004W21Z", "B00JPQ1I7O", "B0002DB54A", "B00005Y1UV", "B00D2UMHGA", "B000F5GNX8", "B00003CXDJ", "B000BBOUW2", "0783230079", "B000JMK6LW", "0800177789", "B00008L3S6", "B004ALIG4W", "B002OGMGV4", "B003VA3JUO", "B004SUDQ22", "B0000648X0", "B00AEFYC96", "B00BEIYMAG", "B002AT8KAG", "0688124402", "B000RO9Q7W", "B00AEFY31S", "B00AEFY2WI", "B002NZK5RI", "B00003CWRF", "B000I2J736", "B00022S7EC", "B000QXDCLA", "B00J0IN6Z4", "B00DW5IL2E", "B00005JH9M", "B00CX7TOOG", "B00DW5IJR6", "B007UW9W5U", "B000EU1ONS", "B00008L3UM", "B00AEBBA2W", "B0037QGS0A", "B000069HZP", "B002NPY7F4", "0783237413", "B00003CXKM", "B00005O5AX", "B0006IIKQW", "B001DE29SS", "B0000A1HR4", "B009XTF8KQ", "B001DB6J6Y", "184358185X", "B004SUDQ8G", "B00001U0DU", "B000X1CQJ4", "B0009298N4", "B0027VTMAE", "B001BPB5YI", "B00AEFYXQI", "6305238065", "B00AEFY37C", "B0000694XY", "B0051CSIKQ", "B003ZHR6T8", "6304884370", "B00AEFY2LO", "B004P3ENLA", "B007IJKQRS", "B00006L91I", "B00AQJ8MLY", "B000U1ZV44", "B0002HOEPI", "B0097C0AUC", "B00000K3TU", "6305133409", "0790730979", "B00BTYOYGW", "B00008DDVY", "0767807588", "B0045NXMJE", "B0007WQHI0", "B00AEFXPG2", "B0002DB52M", "B000OYC7BW", "B00013RC7K", "B00175VSBC", "B0021L8UG2", "B0043X1FNQ", "B002GHHHG0", "B00E1HIWXU", "B00005JL3T", "B004EPYZO4", "B0002C4JJ4", "B00AEFXKZ8"], "bought_together": ["B0001FR3IQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0071HPP1Y", "B00AEBBA2W", "B001BPB5YI", "B0001FR3IQ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 136034}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 16.99, "brand": "Universal Studios", "asin": "0783235410", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71EZ8HJ90ML._SY300_.gif", "title": "In Dreams"}

{"description": "Jane Campion'sThe Pianostruck a deep chord (if you'll excuse the expression) with audiences in 1993, who were mesmerized by the film's rich, dreamlike imagery. It is the story of a Scottish woman named Ada (Holly Hunter), who has been mute since age 6 because she simply chose not to speak. Ada travels with her daughter Flora (Anna Paquin) and her beloved piano to a remote spot on the coast of New Zealand for an arranged marriage to a farmer (Sam Neill). She gives piano lessons to a gruff neighbor (Harvey Keitel) who has Maori tattoos on his face, and, well, things develop from there. The picture takes on a powerful dream logic that simply defies synopsis.

{"description": "Thanks in large part to its meticulous re-creation of the late-1960s and early-'70s rock scene and the uncannily authentic performance by Val Kilmer as legendary Doors frontman Jim Morrison, Oliver Stone's hypnotic film biography is standing the test of time. Capturing the carefree mood of the Age of Aquarius, the film charts the meteoric rise of the Doors on the California club circuit (including a memorable scene showing the creation of the hit &quot;Light My Fire&quot;), and chronicles the band's exploits with hallucinogenics and Morrison's battles against charges of public indecency on stage. Kilmer's performance is hauntingly perfect, and performances by Meg Ryan, Kathleen Quinlan, and Kyle MacLachlan are similarly impressive. The movie doesn't fully probe the depths of Morrison's character, but as a portrait of excess it is vividly true to the spirit of the self-destructive poet known to his fans as &quot;The Lizard King.&quot;--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B003H5WF3U", "0783233485", "B0090O07S2", "B000LPS4L6", "B0006ZE7G2", "B0002CTSXQ", "B005DJ62MS", "B000UCEJDC", "B00FWSWIIM", "B00003CXWV", "0385304471", "0679734627", "0671210440", "B0074JODC6", "0446697338", "B000002HJD", "0783229526", "B003VC6F44", "B002SRHC5Y", "B002AF4Y9G", "0679726225", "B0015UKX74", "B0069GRIHW", "0425170454", "B00029RTAI", "B00004ZBVO", "B00069FKX2", "B004SIP95G", "B0013K1ALE", "B00005JM23", "079284646X", "B000MCIBE8", "B00005JND5", "B00AEFXE9U", "1932855742", "B000002H92", "B000P0J0D8", "B001NXDSLQ", "B000MCIBAW", "0792846435", "B00AEBB9IM", "B0044R7VCK", "B002GIBVVQ", "B000PAAJZ6", "B00005V9HB", "0688119158", "B00006L929", "B000ZM1MGE", "B000002HRA", "B006TTC5HC", "B002XTXGCK", "6305127646", "B0011U8NZ2", "0767805763", "0991252527", "0767812182", "B00029RTCG", "B004SIP9Z6", "B0002V7ON8", "B000NO39FG", "B0009E3234", "B000MCIBB6", "B003ELKNH2", "B00AEFYCL4", "6304711905", "1556525893", "B001MFNB58", "B0085A9HU6", "B0038Z5T4Q", "B004MC98VY", "B00000K3TX", "B004FQX5B6", "B000065U1Q", "B000AXWHSA", "0446602280", "B007NYZ9S4", "B004FQX59I", "B0052FG750", "B004P7CN5O", "B000E8QVWY", "B000CNESTE", "B0000VV508", "B0010DJ174", "B00000IQW4", "B00005JKM2", "0760706182", "B00AEFYW64", "B004SIP9MY", "B00005Q4CS", "B00004XPPB", "B002G1K82Q", "B000F5GNX8", "B000031EFY", "B0057ZAA6W", "B00KCWV6KO", "B00008975Z", "B0034G4P6W", "B00INLE5K4", "B003HKN52U"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0090O07S2", "B003H5WF3U", "B000UCEJDC", "B00FWSWIIM"]}, "price": 7.36, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 118937}, "asin": "0784010528", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71RG0C6WQWL._SY300_.gif", "title": "The Doors"}

{"description": "A strong candidate for the designation of most thrilling action movie ever made (the turbo-charged exhilaration of its full-throttle highway chases has never been equaled), the second part of George Miller's post-apocalyptic trilogy is also a magnificently imagined movie myth. Like theStar Warstrilogy (by that other George) theMad Maxfilms draw their inspiration from the works of mythologist Joseph Campbell. In the 1979 original, Max (Mel Gibson) is a policeman, the last guardian of civilization and order in a devastated world reduced to chaos. But when a leather-clad gang of sadomasochistic speed demons mows down Max's family, his remaining connections to humanity are also permanently severed. After brutally exacting his revenge, Max wanders off into the wasteland alone, &quot;a burned out shell of a man&quot; who (to paraphraseThe Searchers) is destined to wander forever between the winds. InThe Road Warrior, Max rediscovers a sliver of his shattered humanity, and a spark of redemption, when he helps an embattled colony of pioneers fight off the savages who are after that most precious of all commodities: &quot;guzzline.&quot; Max is transformed into a legendary hero, just as Mel Gibson was catapulted to international movie stardom. With its final stirring images,The Road Warriortranscends its genre (whatever that may be--science fiction? Western? action adventure?) and becomes something timeless. It's a great movie.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005R2IS", "0790731932", "B00004Y87O", "B00AEFYDM2", "B003XURDAY", "B00005N5S5", "B00005N7Z1", "0783241895", "B001VLBDD0", "B0002CHK1S", "B000QUCQX8", "B000U1ZV8K", "B003ELKNH2", "B0038SUBEG", "B00000ILDD", "B000RW3VCK", "B0068FZ0O2", "B00AKGG828", "B00AEBBADG", "B00003CXC5", "B00I9TDMRM", "B008CYDD7I", "B00D7AM6M0", "B0000AOX0F", "0783227434", "B00005JMEW", "B003ASLJS6", "0783227396", "B002GHHHME", "0767802519", "1558908846", "B000E6ESEO", "0783228457", "6305821216", "B005J9ZFQG", "B0019BI1DM", "B00IBKXSKA", "B0087DFIYA", "B0000VD12I", "B001JFZ118", "B00005JMUA", "B00005JA8B", "B00005A3KS", "B000P0J0D8", "0790729695", "B004SIP8ZM", "B004SIP95G", "B0009UC810", "B0007WQHI0", "B0001Z37HM", "B0006GANN2", "B0045HCJIK", "B00005JLWN", "0767836316", "B0001611DI", "B000A2UBN4", "B000U1ZV7Q", "B000NA1WGS", "0792833244", "B000FS9FE4", "B002I9Z8AS", "B000QQJ3Q0", "B00005JLJW", "B000VECAD0", "6304806434", "B000056PMU", "B0045HCJGC", "B000P0J0BU", "B0045HCJ9O", "B00005ATQB", "B000022TSY", "B001CDR1FG", "B0045HCJT4", "B000CNESNA", "B00000JDIQ", "B00AEFXKUI", "B00026ZG10", "B000NOKFHQ", "B008Y1YK9Y", "6304698798", "B00004XPPG", "6305428115", "0783225946", "0800195175", "B000A7DVR2", "B003AWRMCE", "B0064NTZQ2", "B00070FX5U", "0792839056", "B000068IEV", "B00005AUK9", "B000WC3864", "B0002CHIKG", "B002AF4Y9G", "B00HZMZ2FE", "B00007AJG4", "B00003CXQA", "B0000A2ZU1", "B00BTYJYR6"], "bought_together": ["B00005R2IS", "0790731932"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00BLRXDTQ", "B00005R2IS", "B000NA1WGS", "0790731932"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 19723}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 29.74, "brand": "Road Warrior", "asin": "0790729342", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ndgIMhPTL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Road Warrior"}
{"description": "When Ridley Scott's cut ofBlade Runnerwas finally released in 1993, one had to wonder why the studio hadn't done it right the first time--11 years earlier. This version is so much better, mostly because of what's been eliminated (the ludicrous and redundant voice-over narration and the phony happy ending) rather than what's been added (a bit more character development and a brief unicorn dream). Star Harrison Ford originally recorded the narration under duress at the insistence of Warner Bros. executives who thought the story needed further \"explanation\"; he later confessed that he thought if he did it badly they wouldn't use it. (Moral: Never overestimate the taste of movie executives.) The movie's spectacular futuristic vision of Los Angeles--a perpetually dark and rainy metropolis that's the nightmare antithesis of \"Sunny Southern California\"--is still its most seductive feature, an otherworldly atmosphere in which you can immerse yourself. The movie's shadowy visual style, along with its classic private-detective/murder-mystery plot line (with Ford on the trail of a murderous android, or \"replicant\"), makesBlade Runnerone of the few science fiction pictures to legitimately claim a place in the film noir tradition. And, as in the best noir, the sleuth discovers a whole lot more (about himself and the people he encounters) than he anticipates.... With Sean Young, Edward James Olmos, Daryl Hannah, Rutger Hauer, and M.

{"description": "EDITOR'S NOTE: According to a Warner Home Video technician involved in  the production ofThe Stanley Kubrick Collection, Kubrick authorized all aspects of theCollection, from the use of Digital Component Video (or \"D-1\") masters originally approved in 1989, to the use of minimalist screen menus, chapter stops, and (in the case of2001: A Space OdysseyandThe Shiningon DVD) supplementary materials. Full-screen presentation ofThe ShiningandFull Metal Jacketwas also approved by Kubrick, who recomposed his original framing,  reportedly believing that those films looked best on video in the full-screen format. (In fact, the original theatrical aspect ratio ofThe Shiningwas 1.66:1, meaning that a relatively small portion of the image is lost.) Kubrick also chose mono over stereo,  believing that inconsistencies in theatrical sound systems resulted in loss of control over theatrical presentation. In every respect, the Warner spokesman  said, the films in theCollectionremain as Kubrick approved them. Any future attempt to remaster or alter them would  have to be approved by an appointee of the Kubrick estate.", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301115430", "6300214826", "630018627X", "6304935811", "6301979761", "B00006C7G9", "B00000J2L7", "0784011923", "0790748169", "630407185X", "0800132009", "6302816580", "6301208773", "B00000JGEI", "B000BT8VVK", "B00000IO4G", "630018224X", "0792133153", "6300248135", "6302054982", "630300394X", "B00000K3AN", "6303696813", "6303020089", "6302415853", "6304826133", "6303029027", "0783235607", "6304259131", "B000065JH1", "0800179552", "6301217977", "B00007CVYA", "0800116917", "B0000CDL3W", "6304214502", "6302935148", "6304414099", "6303168507", "076783819X", "6300248089", "0800125762", "630018403X", "6300213005", "6303269834", "6303109950", "6300246965", "B00006IUOZ", "6300183211", "6304925131", "0783202253", "0783107986", "079213690X", "B000005XXG", "B00000FZCU", "0800187873", "6300214540"], "bought_together": ["6301115430", "6300214826"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 348239}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.99, "brand": "", "asin": "0790701251", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ZM1C6TC7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Full Metal Jacket [VHS]"}

{"description": "One of the key movies of the 1970s, when exciting, groundbreaking, personal films were still being made in Hollywood, Milos Forman'sOne Flew over the Cuckoo's Nestemphasized the humanistic story at the heart of Ken Kesey's more hallucinogenic novel. Jack Nicholson was born to play the part of Randle Patrick McMurphy, the rebellious inmate of a psychiatric hospital who fights back against the authorities' cold attitudes of institutional superiority, as personified by Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher). It's the classic antiestablishment tale of one man asserting his individuality in the face of a repressive, conformist system--and it works on every level. Forman populates his film with memorably eccentric faces, and gets such freshly detailed and spontaneous work from his ensemble that the picture sometimes feels like a documentary. Unlike a lot of films pitched at the &quot;youth culture&quot; of the 1970s,One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nestreally hasn't dated a bit, because the qualities of human nature that Forman captures--playfulness, courage, inspiration, pride, stubbornness--are universal and timeless. The film swept the Academy Awards for 1976, winning in all the major categories (picture, director, actor, actress, screenplay) for the first time since Frank Capra'sIt Happened One Nightin 1931.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002VWNIDG", "B000RTB0R6", "B006TTC5HC", "B000FVQLQQ", "B000P0J0EW", "0767830555", "B0043X1FL8", "B00003CWQR", "B004SIP7ZS", "B003ELKNH2", "B0006GAOJA", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00AEFXN9G", "0767811100", "0792833287", "B004SIP95G", "B0000YEEGM", "B00079Z9VO", "0451163966", "B00AEFYSWM", "B000P0J09M", "B008MIMWP8", "B000EHQU0S", "B006FE83UE", "B000M341QE", "B00AEFXESQ", "B00002VWE0", "B004SIP8ZM", "B002VWNIAY", "B00009W5CA", "0764586629", "B000ZM1MGE", "B00011CZRE", "B000P0J09C", "B0008ENHUI", "B00005V9HH", "B0019L770A", "B0019L21GA", "B00AEBB9CS", "B0050FXDDQ", "B000CNESTE", "B0006GANN2", "B000LP6KNU", "B000P0J0EM", "B00000IQV7", "B000055Y0X", "B00001ZWUS", "079073219X", "B0019UGYK0", "079284646X", "B00AEBB9F0", "B003ASLJO0", "B000A7DVR2", "B00AEBB9FA", "B0002B15ZG", "B004U7MR3M", "B000YAF4MA", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00066FBQG", "B00005JKIS", "6305144168", "B004SIP7TE", "B002ZG980U", "B00005ATQB", "B0045HCJ94", "0783229526", "B000A3XY5A", "B000093FLA", "B00026ZD04", "B004L9GMBC", "B0000DI87S", "B00006RCO1", "B0007PALZ2", "B0000JBALO", "B004IFYMYI", "B007N31YH0", "B000P0J0D8", "B000H4JH7Q", "B00B0U2SFE", "0792846443", "B007D0FVRM", "B000022TSY", "B0087ZG7UW", "B0002234LS", "B0045HCJ9E", "B0000A02TZ", "B001GD6VTE", "B00AEFYRP0", "0784011710", "B00009AOAZ", "B00005JLSB", "B000Q678OO", "0792838408", "6305882592", "B003LMPKSQ", "B00005MEOU", "B00AEFYSL8", "B0057ZAA6W", "B001AEF6BI", "B000HC2LHG"], "bought_together": ["B002VWNIDG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000P0J0EW", "0451163966", "B006TTC5HC", "B00AEFY0F2"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 40218}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.24, "brand": "WARNER STUDIOS", "asin": "0790732181", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51pJoIlXFbL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"}

Think of the story as a twist on John Grisham'sThe Firm, with the corporate evil made even more explicit. Reeves is wooden, and therefore doesn't seem to have much of a soul to lose, but he's really just our excuse to meet the devil.

{"description": "Just Causeis a film that relies on phony plot twists and steals openly from any other thriller that it can remember. If there was a drinking game requiring players to drink during every cinematic \"homage,\" you'd be tanked afterJust Cause's first 45&nbsp;minutes. Take one case of racial injustice, place it in an exotic, exquisitely photographed location (the Florida Everglades), and bring in an outsider, played by a bankable star, to save the day. Make sure nothing appears as it seems. Add a couple of plot twists, some over-the-top character actors (Ed Harris, shamelessly riffing on Hannibal Lecter), stir, and serve. The big name in this case is Sean Connery, who plays a Harvard law professor summoned to the swamps by an apparently innocent death row inmate (Blair Underwood), who swears he didn't rape and kill that 11-year-old girl. He says he confessed because maverick psycho-cop Tanny Brown (Laurence Fishburne) made him play a solo game of Russian roulette. He says his Serial-killer neighbor on death row (Harris) committed the crime. Connery buys it, the audience buys it, and how could they not?

{"description": "Although it eventually runs out of smart ideas and resorts to a typically explosive finale, this above-average thriller rises above its formulaic limitations on the strength of powerful performances by Samuel L. Jackson and Kevin Spacey. Both play Chicago police negotiators with hotshot reputations, but when Jackson's character finds himself falsely accused of embezzling funds from a police pension fund, he's so thoroughly framed that he must take extreme measures to prove his innocence. He takes hostages in police headquarters to buy time and plan his strategy, demanding that Spacey be brought in to mediate with him as an army of cops threatens to attack, and a media circus ensues. Both negotiators know how to get into the other man's thoughts, and this intellectual showdown allows both Spacey and Jackson to ignite the screen with a burst of volatile intensity. Director F. Gary Gray is disadvantaged by an otherwise predictable screenplay, but he has a knack for building suspense and is generous to a fine supporting cast, including Paul Giamatti as one of Jackson's high-strung hostages, and the late J.T. Walsh in what would sadly be his final big-screen role. The movie should have trusted its compelling characters a little more, probing their psyches more intensely to give the suspense a deeper dramatic foundation, but it's good enough to give two great actors a chance to strut their stuff.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305428115", "B00015YVDG", "B000JYW5BE", "0780618548", "B002NZK5VO", "B00AEFXT1S", "0783240295", "0790732149", "0790736411", "B002O3Z4WK", "6304711891", "B00003CXGV", "6304806434", "B0045HCJFS", "6304765258", "B003ASLJIQ", "B002AS464Q", "B00005ATZT", "B00009WVSL", "B00AEFYUQQ", "B000GFLKF8", "B00AEFYF2K", "B000OT6V0K", "B00AEFY6PQ", "B00AP2DC94", "B00AEBB9NM", "B000QUCRB4", "B000CEV3M8", "B005LAIGRS", "B00004Z1FX", "B00005V9HH", "B00009L1TA", "6304698747", "B00008EYA5", "B002GIBVVG", "B002NZK5RI", "B000055Y0Y", "B00004Z4WR", "B00005JA9F", "B0006GANOQ", "B002AT8KA6", "0792159659", "B003VA3JZY", "B00011CZRE", "B000U1ZV8K", "B004IK30MI", "B008B9JTLI", "B0045HCJ8K", "B000YCPUWW", "B000U1ZV4Y", "B001B3LIOC", "B00005JLZN", "0780621603", "B002NZK5UU", "0783226888", "B00096S49Y", "B001JV5AZE", "B00005JL5F", "B000FOPPD8", "B00005JPD0", "B00029RT9E", "1558908315", "B000ENC5YW", "B00AEBB8LA", "B00008L3S6", "B0045HCJGC", "B002LMV7R0", "B002AT8KAG", "B0000ACOXL", "B0007KIFGE", "B00AEFXEGS", "B00008G8M4", "B003L20IG0", "B00BEIYN9Q", "B004A8ZX28", "B00007AJG1", "B0001FR3IQ", "B00003W8NT", "B000P0J0EW", "B00AEBB86A", "B00006JDVT", "B00151QYSK", "0800141806", "B00AEFXX9Q", "B00004STDN", "B00005JKWX", "6304806450", "B002GHHHP6", "B002CPMB9O", "B002NZK5R8", "B003HTSJAY", "B00005Y1UV", "B000P0J0AG", "B000O78KW4", "0767803434", "B00004BZIY", "B00000G3PA", "B0000VJG72", "B00005JLQN"], "bought_together": ["6305428115"], "buy_after_viewing": ["6305428115", "B00015YVDG", "0767803434", "6304711891"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 60910}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.88, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "0790739739", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51P690CDMHL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Negotiator"}

{"description": "Any Given Sunday, Oliver Stone's salute-cum-expos&#xE9; of pro football, belabors some pretty obvious points for nigh onto three hours; but between the frenetic editing, the pounding rap-music beats, and several flashy performances, it's certainly never dull. Al Pacino, coach of the fictional Miami Sharks (the NFL declined involvement in this production), struggles with the most time-honored of sports movie dilemmas: what to do with the old friend who's past his prime and the young hotshot who could save the franchise but first has to learn what being a team player is all about. Comedian Jamie Foxx does a marvelous dramatic turn as the rookie quarterback whose ego and talent are equally impressive, while Pacino seems more at ease in Oliver Stone Land than any actor since regular James Woods (on hand as well as a sleazy team doctor). Prowling the sidelines, shouting spittle-flecked orders, seizing up in almost physical pain when a play goes the wrong way, Pacino is as unashamedly--and entertainingly--hyperbolic as Stone's whirling montages of boiling storm clouds, bloodthirsty fans, and players smashed into the mud. (Once again football, perhaps the most sophisticated of team sports, is viewed cinematically as a bunch of guys hitting each other in slow motion.) Unfortunately, all the self-conscious mythologizing and pumped-up macho posturing that Stone can muster doesn't conceal a clich&eacute;d, slapped-together script, whose few good ideas (mostly about race in America) jostle about with several hoary, terrible ones--including a too-literal analogy of football players as modern gladiators. (To drive the point home, Stone includes Charlton Heston--the agingBen-Hur--in one of many star-powered cameos.) All in all,Any Given Sundayis never dull, but never very enjoyable, either.--Bruce Reid", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305428492", "B00005JNEW", "B002O3Z4XY", "B00AEFYR3C", "B00AEBB9UU", "B000056VP4", "B000J3OTT6", "B00E1HIXFW", "B00005JPBO", "B00AEFXJY0", "B00004W221", "B00AEFXOKO", "B000KHYN9C", "B000EXZFCQ", "B002VWNIEA", "B000GAKDAG", "B00AEFYJI0", "B000FVR1T2", "B001LGXIA6", "630514415X", "B00005JLG1", "B000CBCWRG", "B0001Q4BOE", "B0001US66Y", "630529142X", "B0015OKWL2", "B00006RVJR", "B00003GPFT", "B0000JBUHI", "B002VECM6S", "078324021X", "6305505780", "B00009ZPUA", "B00004TJQJ", "0783226845", "B0000AC8LH", "B00BTYPWDQ", "B000C20VPA", "B00AEFYE08", "0767813901", "B000C20VRS", "B002CA68N4", "B00003CXNG", "B00005JLX2", "B00003W8NT", "B00275EGWY", "0792843592", "6305065551", "B000P0J09M", "B000MNOX94", "B00005N89M", "B00AEFYKWU", "B000P0J0AG", "B00005M20J", "6305428115", "B002NZK5VO", "B0000TG94W", "B003VA3JZY", "B00005JA9F", "B0034G4OSG", "B000CNESTE", "6305310335", "1558908390", "B000PAAJZ6", "B00000JGHV", "B0019L770A", "B004SIP7TE", "B0010YSD8Q", "B001GZ6QC4", "B000MGBSE4", "B00AEFY5B6", "6304765258", "B000F6ZIIS", "B001GKJ2E8", "B0000TWMWK", "B000JYW5BO", "B000BOH8X2", "B00005JKMQ", "B001DJLD1M", "B0041QSZS8", "B002AT8K9W", "B002O3Z50Q", "B009YQJ2Q4", "B000FOPPDI", "B001FB55NK", "B00004Z4WR", "B0045HCJG2", "B000M341QE", "B0029Z8K74", "B000A0GP0Y", "B000065U1N", "6301971345", "B0045HCIXG", "B00AEFXP8K", "B00005JN2Z", "B003PIUIIS", "155890834X", "B00066FAQW", "B000MXPE7O"], "bought_together": ["B00005JNEW", "B000056VP4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00B83N2NU", "B00000JXVK", "B00005JPBO", "B00005JNEW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 56346}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.98, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "0790749912", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5193WdbH-eL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Any Given Sunday"}
{"description": "Something is awry at Boston General Hospital.  Dr. Wheeler's (Genevieve Bujold) friend Nancy goes in for a routine procedure, but never comes out of the anesthesia and slips into a coma.  Wheeler learns that a tissue sample from the young woman went to the lab, then soon finds out that a high number of patients have become comatose recently.  She digs a little deeper and finds a conspiracy mired in hospital politics, running afoul of the head of anesthesia, Dr. George (Rip Torn) and the head of surgery, Dr. Harris (Richard Widmark).  Nobody believes the young MD, not even her boyfriend Dr. Bellows (Michael Douglas), but she soon uncovers a black-market trade in body parts, conducted offsite at the Jefferson Institute, a state-of-the-art coma-care facility.   As a thriller,Comacertainly has its moments (the scene where a hit man is buried under a pile of frozen-stiff cadavers is an inspired touch), but it's not without its problems.  Director Michael Crichton is an MD himself, and the film has a seamless, almost mechanical structure and plotline (taken from the Robin Cook novel).  However, the movie's cold, detached feel works against it at times, making the suspense scenes oddly more effective but rendering the emotional content of the characters rather flat.  Douglas in particular seems to not put much into his performance; Bujold, on the other hand, is strong and resourceful as the movie's protagonist.  More telling, perhaps, is the way that the story shows its age in a time when medical ethics have changed and the phrase \"organ harvesting\" has made its way into our lexicon.--Jerry Renshaw", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JP4N", "B0045HCJKS", "B000QQJ3Q0", "B00008438U", "B00CPTUOI2", "B00006SFJI", "B008UTV5A2", "B00026L8US", "B000IHY9D4", "0451207394", "B004LB5FDG", "B0016I0AJG", "B0000633QT", "B000O78KWE", "B001BGS17Q", "B00004TX5G", "B0013LL2Z2", "B000P0J0BU", "B001DE29SI", "B005FQ2H8W", "B00006L91B", "B007Y1NNAW", "B000E5N684", "B00H83EUQW", "B000ETRA5U", "B000087F6L", "B0006B2A42", "0792839064", "B000FVQLKW", "B007NR9WBG", "0783229399", "B0015NORDW", "B00AJXO3S8", "B000CEXEWA", "B0050MB5N4", "B004I1K05W", "B00AEBB8VK", "B000FO0AA6", "B000G5SILC", "B001KO1BCG", "B003ODIUZ2", "B000EHSVOG", "B0069UP2PI", "B000XJD34I", "B000096IAC", "B003O7I6SE", "B0001FGC1U", "B00AEFY0KW", "079073639X", "B000CEV3M8", "B000EHSVNW", "B0002W4UDE", "0767812166", "B002NZK5R8", "B00005ATZT", "B000063UR1", "B0043X1FLS"], "bought_together": ["B0045HCJKS", "B00008438U"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00CPTUOI2", "B0045HCJKS", "B008UTV5A2", "B000E5N684"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 109997}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.95, "brand": "DOUGLAS,MICHAEL", "asin": "0790743671", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51KQ4R9i4dL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Coma"}

{"description": "Let's see--he's been Han Solo in three films and Indiana Jones in three more. So why shouldn't Harrison Ford take on a new continuing character in Tom Clancy's CIA analyst Jack Ryan? In this film, directed by Phillip Noyce, Ford picked up the baton when Alec Baldwin, who played Ryan inThe Hunt for Red October, opted for a Broadway role instead. In this film, Ryan and his family are on vacation when Ryan saves a member of the British royal family from attack by Irish terrorists. The next thing he knows, the Ryan clan has been targeted by the same terrorists, who invade his Maryland home. The film can't shed all of Clancy's lumbering prose, or his techno-dweeb fascination with spy satellites and the like.

{"description": "When the theatrical release of James Cameron'sTitanicwas delayed from July to December of 1997, media pundits speculated that Cameron's $200&nbsp;million disaster epic would cause the director's downfall, signal the end of the blockbuster era, and sink Paramount Studios as quickly as the ill-fated luxury liner had sunk on that fateful night of April&nbsp;14, 1912. Some studio executives were confident, others horrified, but the clarity of hindsight turned Cameron into an Oscar-winning genius, a shrewd businessman, and one of the most successful directors in the history of motion pictures.Titanicwould surpass the $1&nbsp;billion mark in global box-office receipts (largely due to multiple viewings, the majority by teenage girls), win 11&nbsp;Academy Awards including best picture and director, produce the best-selling movie soundtrack of all time, and make a global superstar of Leonardo DiCaprio. A bona fide pop-cultural phenomenon, the film has all the ingredients of a blockbuster (romance, passion, luxury, grand scale, a snidely villain, and an epic, life-threatening crisis), but Cameron's alchemy of these ingredients proved more popular than anyone could have predicted. His stroke of genius was to combine absolute authenticity with a pair of fictional lovers whose tragic fate would draw viewers into the heart-wrenching reality of theTitanicdisaster. As starving artist Jack Dawson and soon-to-be-married socialite Rose DeWitt Bukater, DiCaprio and Kate Winslet won the hearts of viewers around the world, and their brief but never-forgotten love affair provides the humanity that Cameron needed to turnTitanicinto an emotional experience. Present-day framing scenes (featuring Gloria Stuart as the 101-year-old Rose) add additional resonance to the story, and although some viewers proved vehemently immune to Cameron's manipulations, few can deny the production's impressive achievements. Although some of the computer-generated visual effects look artificial, others--such as the sunset silhouette ofTitanicduring its first evening at sea, or the climactic splitting of the ship's sinking hull--are state-of-the-art marvels. In terms of sets and costumes alone, the film is never less than astounding. More than anything else, however, the film's overwhelming popularity speaks for itself.Titanicis an event film and a monument to Cameron's risk-taking audacity, blending the tragic irony of theTitanicdisaster with just enough narrative invention to give the historical event its fullest and most timeless dramatic impact.Titanicis an epic love story on par withGone with the Wind, and like that earlier box-office phenomenon, it's a film for the ages.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305123616", "6304117752", "6301792734", "6303215734", "B00000JS61", "6304178352", "6303396623", "6303314015", "B00003CXTF", "0769403468", "6301734734", "6302936381", "6303300480", "6305368139", "B00005RRG3", "6302610702", "0792839846", "6300207919", "B000P0J0C4", "6304546262", "B000056BRF", "6304400551", "6303101267", "630150528X", "6303637574", "B000P0J0EW", "6305126062", "6302935148", "0800199421", "6304681496", "0792116887", "6301963911", "B0000DCGT1", "B00001IVED", "6305169187", "B00006RCST", "6300216721", "630197879X", "0800113055", "076780922X", "080010367X", "0800141326", "0800184319", "6304039522", "B000066AXC"], "bought_together": ["6305123616"], "also_viewed": ["B009VQHDSQ", "6303314015", "B0074JODXU", "B00003CXTF", "B003JQZXWW", "6302787068", "6301796535", "0788812807", "0788806270", "B00005JKDQ", "6304500831", "6305229449", "6304117752", "6300213668", "6304089767", "B0000AQZYM", "079213690X", "6303049079", "6305123616", "6303402348", "6301792734", "0788812408", "B00079HZSE", "B000035Z2S", "B00000K3AN", "0788805843", "6302526574", "B0000029YC", "6303534422", "6303215734", "B0070285YE", "B00008LDO9", "0783216084", "6304434340", "B00BBND56G", "0788805533", "6300183211", "6302320402", "6305750750", "B0002CHI3S", "0790748266", "6304143184", "B0000040CM", "B005X7H9SQ", "B00004RFHF", "B00005V1Z7", "6302814782", "6301572688", "B00000JS61", "B008SLUWZG", "6303257844", "B00078XGO2", "0790736039", "B0000040EJ", "B000065U6Q", "B00003CX7L", "B00000ADKZ", "6300263673", "6302178924"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 65950}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.47, "brand": "Paramount", "asin": "0792151712", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21BAWEVBJ1L.jpg", "title": "Titanic [VHS]"}

{"description": "A flawed but admirably ambitious gangster movie,Hoodlumaspires to be a kind of Harlem-based equivalent toThe Godfather, and while it falls short of that lofty goal it's still got plenty of qualities to make it well worth seeing. It's the first film to tell the story of Ellsworth &quot;Bumpy&quot; Johnson (charismatically played by Laurence Fishburne), an ex-convict who dominated the Harlem numbers racket during the 1930s and '40s. As he rises to power he gains equally powerful enemies, including hotheaded Bronx gangster Dutch Schultz (Tim Roth) and the suave mobster Lucky Luciano (Andy Garcia). Determined to defend his Harlem turf against these invaders, Bumpy eclipses the &quot;policy queen&quot; Stephanie St. Clair (Cicely Tyson) and becomes a self-styled Robin Hood figure, attracting the attention of a community servant (Vanessa Williams) who must confront the brutality of Bumpy's business. A must-see for anyone who likes gangster movies,Hoodlumis certainly not a masterpiece, but sharp performances and some powerful scenes make it an interesting look at a little-known chapter in criminal history.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00007AJG1", "B00AEFY6TW", "B004YCKJGU", "B0000AMJEK", "6305505802", "1558908390", "B0041QSZS8", "B0000JBUHI", "B00004U103", "B00005IA7Y", "B0001FGBUW", "B00003W8NT", "B007TBIUSM", "B00AEFYE08", "B00000JGHV", "B002CPMB9O", "B000059TGC", "B0000TWMT8", "B000TLOMPE", "6305505780", "B004SIP93S", "B003BV8I3Q", "B0000696I2", "B00005U156", "B000JJSL1W", "B0000YEE6M", "B00AEBB9AA", "B006VRRGQW", "B000H5TH20", "B000P0J0CE", "B002CA68N4", "B000KG4BD6", "B000EHSVRI", "6305428409", "B002CA68NO", "B0000DI87S", "B00005JLG1", "B004G7XCRQ", "B00441GZ1Y", "B000BOH8X2", "B00004Z1FX", "B00465I1CE", "B000A2XAQ4", "B0009S4IGA", "B00BTYPWDQ", "B000068QPV", "B00AEBB9NM", "B000E5KQHI", "B00008977B", "B001C0I61M", "0780627822", "0783237367", "B00005JL72", "B00007ELEO", "B0006H32DO", "B000FS9ULC", "B000HDZKLO", "B003VA3JZY", "B0000549B2", "B000BITV9W", "B002CWKU36", "B00004XPPB", "B00023P4IS", "0767811070", "B000P0J0AG", "B000051YMS", "B002GSXKOM", "B00005B8UA", "B000P0J09M", "B0009K7RMA", "B00005RDAO", "B00008RH3L", "B0034G4OSG", "B000C20VRS", "B0016LFG4M", "B00007L4KF", "B00005UQ9I", "B001DJLD12", "B000JLTRH2", "B00066FAQW", "B00005AQML", "B00003CY51", "B00003CXWV", "B0000AM6JI", "B001P3SA94", "B00005N7Z6", "B000089729", "B000QXDCLU", "0792833848", "B000060MWA", "B000JYW5BO", "B00CMDPT3Q", "B002VWNIEA", "B002QEHPQU", "B003HKN534", "B001K98MGE", "B00005JLON", "6305428441", "6304884400", "B00000JGHJ"], "bought_together": ["B00AEFY6TW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AEFY6TW", "B0000YEE6M", "1558908390", "B00BTYPWDQ"]}, "price": 6.48, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 33559}, "asin": "0792838076", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51AIkLOvT1L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Hoodlum"}

{"description": "Eliot Asinof's detailed bookEight Men Outillustrates how the system of American sports collapsed in 1919, the year the Chicago White Sox threw the World Series. Filmmaker John Sayles worked on his script years before the 1988&nbsp;film (or before he had the rights to make the film) as a labor of love. Sayles's adaptation proves one can make a historically accurate film in the day and age of artistic license. And what a story. Although many know about the \"Black Sox,\" made famous--again--in the 1989 hit filmField of Dreams, the details of the saga are far less known. The center ofDreams, Shoeless Joe Jackson (portrayed correctly by D.B.&nbsp;Sweeney as illiterate and left-handed inEight), is not the core of this film; it's ace pitcher Eddie Cicotte (Sayles favorite David Strathairn), who took the money, and third baseman Buck Weaver (John Cusack), who did not. The film fits nicely into Sayles's (Lone Star) strong suit: the ensemble drama. We are introduced to bickering owners, famous crooks, high-minded judges, lowlife gangsters, investigative reporters (played by Studs Terkel and Sayles himself), and, most of all, players who are at the breaking point when it comes to low salaries and degrading rewards. While some may feel the film is not as visceral as it should be, there is a great amount of verisimilitude when watching finely tuned athletes telling their bodies to play poorly--heartbreak on the nation's diamond. Beautifully detailed (like Sayles's previous labor-drama,Matewan),Eight Men Outgives us powerful lessons in which everyone lost: players, gamblers, and especially the fans who love the game.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005M20M", "6302534372", "0767809262"], "bought_together": ["B00005M20M"], "also_viewed": ["B000003KMM", "B0000399WO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 448268}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.67, "brand": "", "asin": "0792841786", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GD6FM6ZVL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Eight Men Out [VHS]"}

{"description": "Very few films come close to the brilliance Kenneth Branagh achieved with his first foray into screenwriting and direction.Henry Vqualifies as a masterpiece, the kind of film that comes along once in a decade. He eschews the theatricality of Laurence Olivier's stirring, fondly remembered 1945 adaptation to establish his own rules. Branagh plays it down and dirty, seeing the bard's play through revisionist eyes, framing it as an antiwar story. Branagh gives us harsh close-ups of muddied, bloody men, and close-ups of himself as Henry, his hardened mouth and willful eyes revealing much about this land war. Not that the director-star doesn't provide lighter moments. His scenes introducing the French Princess Katherine (Emma Thompson) are toothsome. Bubbly, funny, enhanced by lovely lighting and Thompson's pale beauty, these glimpses of a princess trying to learn English quickly from her maid are delightful.What may be the crowning glory of Branagh's adaptation comes when the dazed, shaky leader wanders through battlefields, not even sure who has won. As King Hal carries a dead boy  (Empire of the Sun's Christian Bale) over the hacked-up bodies of both the English and French, you realize it is the first time Branagh has opened up the scenes: a panorama of blood and mud and death. It is as strong a statement against warmongering as could ever be made.--Rochelle O'Gorman", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JLCI", "B0000714BZ", "0780021320", "B00B6OEEKQ", "0792844041", "B00CDV4JNS", "B001TR4G6W", "B000Q7ZNDG", "6305622876", "B004P29LDG", "B0007WRT4Q", "B00DQN6IOK", "B00000JL7T", "B000HWZ4AC", "B000002RRG", "B00019072G", "B0002TVWYW", "B00443FMKM", "B004M9ZI0M", "B000E6ESKS", "B00004Z4WW", "B001LPWGHS", "0769712231", "B00AMEZDPG", "B007RP4CAA", "B000063JZQ", "B00B2BYY1W", "B0059XTUR2", "B0002CHIVK", "B00005S872", "B003H0ZGWW", "B007RP4BZ6", "B0013D8LWC", "B0038RSJ0U", "B000QGE8IS", "B00J379KKW", "B008H6GHE2", "0822000296", "0198320337", "B000QGE8JC", "B00B1E6EAY", "0451526902", "0780021312", "B00BTYJYP8", "B000FILVO6", "B000777I88", "B004SIP83Y", "B000LPR6GA", "B0007LFPJ8", "1904271081", "B0000APNTV", "1411401034", "B00AJER4EM", "B005COLEOA", "0743484878", "B007H7OQW2", "0787970832", "B008D1A18E", "B00ECR7KX2", "B000056HEA", "B0012EM5CE", "B00019JRFY", "B00005YUO1", "B00B2BYY30", "B006JY3OHW", "B0000640TB", "B004SIP9U6", "B00063MC1Q", "0393927652", "B000002974", "B00AZFECHW", "B003Y5H5JM", "B007I1Q4YU", "1932219110", "B00A7OBIGO", "0140714790", "B007CJL17S", "0486428877", "B00007G1WH", "B00006G8HO", "B000BR6QIM", "B000RF7XYO", "B007I1Q50S", "B0002235QM", "B0038RSIGA", "B001VLBDB2", "0544442784", "B0068MNNOE", "B000BP86VE", "B003X82D1K", "B00K5EJHGO", "B00A1C17EK", "0439686806", "B0007CNXV4", "B0007WFUGK", "B0001UZZM2", "B0002Y4TII", "0743484916", "0838801366", "B000ALAT64"], "bought_together": ["B00005JLCI", "B0000714BZ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00DQN6IOK", "B0000714BZ", "B00005JLCI", "B003KSAYY6"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 15150}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 67.9, "brand": "MGM", "asin": "079284615X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51P0S2827PL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Henry V"}

{"description": "What's completely and utterly baffling aboutKiller Klownsis not the plot--that's rather tidily summed up by the title--but the fact that it got made at all. According to the filmmakers, (the Chiodo brothers: Charles, Edward, and Stephen) all it took to convince the studio was a one-page treatment and a picture of a clown holding a gun. It boggles the mind. Anyway, some killer Klowns descend from outer space and start wrapping their hapless victims in cotton candy for later consumption. Debbie and Mike suspect something's amiss, but who will believe them? The movie's greatest asset is its willingness to play on the inherent creepiness of clowns. The Klowns are grotesque parodies of their big-top cousins, hiding hideous malformed teeth behind terrifying circus makeup. It's impossible to tell ifKiller Klownsis truly meant to be scary, but it is compelling in its thoroughness: popcorn, balloon animals, and really big shoes are all used to their fullest effect.

A needy, psychologically unbalanced cable-television installer (Carrey) forces his friendship upon an unsuspecting bachelor (Matthew Broderick) who has just broken up with his fianc&eacute;e. The movie gets edgier and more desperate--and in some respects funnier--as Carrey's cable guy gradually goes crazy.

In this version, which considerably dumbs down the Lois Duncan book, the bad guy chases naughty teenagers with a hook, all the while dressed as a dark version of the Gorton's fisherman. They seem to have killed someone in a car accident while out partying, and a price must be paid. Nothing new is added to the genre, though it would be unfair not to note that this does have some scary moments. That is about all it has, because as much as this wanted to be anotherScream, it hasn't the heart or the script. It does, however, have the requisite cast of small-screen stars (includingParty of Five's Jennifer Love Hewitt and Buffy herself, Sarah Michelle Gellar) to have snagged box-office success, spawning a sequel.--Rochelle O'Gorman", "related": {"also_bought": ["0767826728", "0792151712"], "bought_together": ["0767826728"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 332658}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.8, "brand": "", "asin": "0800184319", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/7107W97AXAL._SY300_.gif", "title": "I Know What You Did Last Summer [VHS]"}
{"description": "1995 had already seen the box-office success of sword-wielding heroes inRob RoyandBraveheartwhen along came this glossy revision of the Arthurian legend, in which Lady Guinevere (Julia Ormond) is torn between her love for the noble King Arthur (Sean Connery) and the passionate knight Sir Lancelot (Richard Gere). As the story opens, Guinevere's lands are under attack by the evil knight Malagant (Ben Cross), and she must choose between marriage to Arthur and the security of Camelot, or encouraging the affections of Lancelot, who has heroically rescued her from a potentially lethal attack. Anyone looking for meticulous medieval authenticity won't find it here, but director Jerry Zucker (Ghost) keeps the action moving with exuberant spirit and glorious production values. Even if you don't completely believe Richard Gere as a somewhat too-contemporary Lancelot, the performances of Ormond and especially Connery are effortlessly appealing.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302025079"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 317504}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.88, "brand": "", "asin": "0800129806", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/513PMC55B8L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "First Knight [VHS]"}
{"description": "Thirteen-year-old Jenna (Shana Dowdeswell) has had enough with the trials of adolescence. In addition to being saddled with a devoted-but-nerdy best friend, Matt (Sean Marquette), she falls victim to one of the dangers of playing Seven Minutes in Heaven with the coolest kids in school: being stranded without a willing make-out partner. Humiliated, Jenna buries herself in the aforementioned make-out closet, wishing she could skip the whole adolescence bit and move straight into adulthood, and miraculously wakes up just weeks away from her 30th birthday. Of course, a lot has changed since going to bed the night before, not the least of which being an impressive set of womanly curves. The new, older Jenna (Jennifer Garner) is a successful magazine editor with friends in high places and a lion's share of potential suitors -- including a hockey-playing boyfriend and a swarthy married man. The problem is that her mind hasn't matured with her body; Jenna not only finds living on her own more terrifying than cool, but is quick to dismiss any male over the age of 14 as \"gross.\" Half excited, half mortified, Jenna seeks out Matt (Mark Ruffalo), whom she learns she had spurned as a teenager in an effort to join the popular crowd.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00006ZXSL", "B00AKGG6JS", "B00005O5CM", "B00AEFXO8Q", "B0015I2RT8", "B001OQCUYI", "B00005JMCW", "B001OQCUZM", "B00003CXSM", "B000J103OI", "B00AEFYM2S", "B002K0WBXW", "B00AEBB8R4", "B000EMGICS", "B004SIP9X8", "B003LSFM6U", "B0000897EG", "B000ELJAEM", "B00AEFY99O", "1401324142", "6304765266", "1416205152", "B00GO37I8Y", "0809229374", "B0001XAR1I", "B0001Z3TXE", "B00005JM55", "B00AEFYWQY", "B00007E2F5", "B0002VYOVI", "B00KS9V6EC", "B000J4QW7W", "B000YDBPAM", "B0007PLLBU", "B001TUZD8O", "B002ZG988M", "B0009OL7Z4", "B004SIP9RO", "B0000ZMGWK", "1400050138", "B0000DZ6N3", "B00AQS803A", "6302077818", "B00006ZXSK", "B00005JN0Z", "B000YAA68C", "B0007LXPBI", "B00E4Z7FQY", "B002P413IC", "B001ASQ9OM", "B006YTGL86", "B00795C5X4", "B00063KGPU", "B000BVM1S2", "B000209KMW", "B000A343RI", "B00062IVN0", "B000P0J0DS", "B00002SSKI", "6305428425", "B003TY2SWC", "B0051GLDVS", "B00008K7AM", "B0071HPOGK", "B0000AKCJK", "B000023VTP", "B00AEBB8YW", "B00006FMUW", "B002XTXG8O", "B00AMEZDJW", "B001AEF6BS", "B00447L4KA", "B000MQC9H4", "6305428042", "B002GOAH1U", "B0036TGSIK", "B002A5EBMQ", "B0000AOV4I", "B001C5LLQ4", "B000324Y98", "B00005JG6N", "6305236569", "B00AEFZ6V4", "B004EPZ070", "B003L20ICE", "B0038N9X3Q", "B00AEBBA2M", "B00005JN3W", "B0075RREYG", "B000F2BNW2", "0783235070", "B0021L8UO4", "0800177258", "B002SYAGNC", "B000HT386M", "B0007P0Y7C", "B000QUU4LY", "B00006ZXSN", "B00AEBB9WI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0013D8LFY", "B002K0WBXW", "B00AKGG6JS", "B001OQCUZM"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 461629}, "asin": "1404918051", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41EO6%2BQ3jvL.jpg", "title": "13 Going on 30: Fun &amp; Flirty Edition"}

{"description": "Robert Bresson drew inspiration from Dostoevsky'sCrime and Punishmentfor this examination of an arrogant young pickpocket who deems himself above the laws and conditions of ordinary men. Michel (Martin LaSalle), a rather bland-looking young man with a perpetually blank face, haunts the subways, city streets, and racetracks to ply his trade. He plays a game of wits with a fatherly police inspector and walls his heart off from the affections of a quiet young woman, Jeanne (Marika Green), who looks after his dying mother. Bresson's direction of his \"models\" (as he calls his nonprofessional performers) strips them of affectation and motivation, making them blank slates defined by the accumulation of precisely drilled actions and words.Pickpocketis no thriller, though Bresson offers impressive, meticulously detailed scenes of daring and intimate robberies (one sequence on a subway feels like an homage to Sam Fuller'sPickup on South Street). Rather, it is a powerful, profound search for meaning and spiritual enlightenment by a man who believes in nothing but himself, and many critics consider it Bresson's masterpiece. Paul Schrader, whose bookTranscendental Cinemaoffers a detailed analysis of Bresson's work, has quoted the famous, emotionally restrained yet spiritually moving conclusion in two of his own films:American GigoloandLight Sleeper.--Sean Axmaker", "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 597369}, "asin": "1567301290", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21WTVB3RD3L.jpg", "title": "Pickpocket [VHS]"}
{"description": "As critic Roger Ebert observed in his original review ofRan, this epic tragedy might have been attempted by a younger director, but only the Japanese master Akira Kurosawa, who made the film at age 75, could bring the requisite experience and maturity to this stunning interpretation of Shakespeare'sKing Lear. It's a film for the ages--one of the few genuine screen masterpieces--and arguably serves as an artistic summation of the great director's career. In this version of the Shakespeare tragedy, the king is a 16th-century warlord (Tatsuya Nakadai as Lord Hidetora) who decides to retire and divide his kingdom evenly among his three sons. When one son defiantly objects out of loyalty to his father and warns of inevitable sibling rivalry, he is banished and the kingdom is awarded to his compliant siblings. The loyal son's fears are valid: a duplicitous power struggle ensues and the aging warlord witnesses a maelstrom of horrifying death and destruction. Although the film is slow to establish its story, it's clear that Kurosawa, who planned and painstakingly designed the production for 10 years before filming began, was charting a meticulous and tightly formalized dramatic strategy. As familial tensions rise and betrayal sends Lord Hidetora into the throes of escalating madness,Ran(the title is the Japanese character for \"chaos\" or \"rebellion\") reaches a fever pitch through epic battles and a fortress assault that is simply one of the most amazing sequences on film.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301661737", "6303202055", "6303386717", "6303073107", "630296931X", "6301955293", "B000001A5E", "0780018702", "0783217528"], "bought_together": ["6301661737"], "also_viewed": ["6303202055", "6302919649", "6302891272", "6301942647", "6302969697", "6303073107"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 368153}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.87, "brand": "", "asin": "1572522089", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514XW5P94GL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Ran [VHS]"}
{"description": "Fran&ccedil;ois Truffaut's third feature, though it's named for the two  best friends who become virtually inseparable in pre-World War&nbsp;I Paris, is  centered on Jeanne Moreau's Catherine, the most mysterious, enigmatic woman in his career-long gallery of rich female portraits. Adapted from the novel by Henri-Pierre Roch&eacute;, Truffaut's picture explores the 30-year friendship between Austrian biologist Jules (Oskar Werner) and Parisian writer Jim (Henri Serre) and the love triangle formed when the alluring Catherine makes the duo a trio. Spontaneous and lively, a woman of intense but dynamic emotions, she becomes the axle on which their friendship turns as Jules woos her and they marry, only to find that no one man can hold her. Directed in bursts of concentrated scenes interspersed with montage sequences and pulled together by the commentary of an omniscient narrator, Truffaut layers his tragic drama with a wealth of detail. He draws on his bag of New Wave tricks for the carefree days of youth--zooms, flash cuts, freeze frames--that disappear as the marriage disintegrates during the gloom of the postwar years. Werner is excellent as Jules, a vibrant young man whose slow, melancholy slide into emotional compromise is charted in his increasingly sad eyes and resigned face, while Serre plays Jim as more of an enigma, guarded and introspective. But both are eclipsed in the glare of Moreau's radiant Catherine: impulsive, demanding, sensual, passionate, destructive, and ultimately unknowable. A masterpiece of the French New Wave and one of Truffaut's most confident and accomplished films.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["1572524448"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 485144}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.97, "brand": "", "asin": "1572525851", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51NEMNZZ25L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Jules and Jim [VHS]"}

With its darkly disturbing La Femme Nikita-style story line, this film begs to be more than the 45-minute event that it is, rivaling the live-action works of Luc Besson and even John Woo. The story involves a college student, Sawa, whose family was brutally murdered. Sawa is adopted by Mr. Akai, the police detective investigating the case, and a twist occurs when we find that Mr. Akai has trained and utilized Sawa as an assassinating angel of vengeance to eliminate the undesirables able to slip through the net of the legal system. In the undertaking of one of these missions, Sawa meets Oburi, another orphan trained like her for the same purpose, and she is placed in the classic position of having to make a life-changing decision. Insights into the truth about Sawa's past are revealed through abstract flashbacks as the film progresses at maniacally breakneck speed, with intense gun battles and blood and guts galore.Kiteis exquisitely animated by Yasuomi Umetsu and accompanied by a hauntingly beautiful soundtrack composed by An Fu, and the only flaw is that it could have been expanded by exploring more of its profound emotional revelations.--Hector V.

{"description": "At the time of its original release in 1984, this modestly budgeted sci-fi excursion had the distinction of offering some of the first examples of purely computer-generated animation, an apt (and frugal) special-effects solution for a movie with a plot line rooted in computer games. Both the computer-generated visuals and the arcade game now look quaint, but writer-director Nick Castle's affable, good- hearted adventure holds up nicely, thanks to a clever premise--the title game is actually a test for prospective starship pilots, planted by embattled aliens under siege from an evil invader. When a restless teenager (Lance Guest) racks up an impressive score, he finds himself spirited away to the besieged planet and thrust into the midst of an intergalactic war. Apart from Castle's skill at contrasting his extraterrestrial settings with the mundane details of his hero's earthbound life, the movie gets lift-off from two thorough pros, Robert Preston, who makes the alien recruiter, Centauri, a planet-hopping cousin toThe Music Man's Harold Hill, and Dan O'Herlihy, the alien copilot, who suggests a scaly Walter Brennan. Older fans will snicker, but kids and young teens will find this rite of passage absorbing, while their folks will savor Preston's brash charm.--Sam Sutherland", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302814782", "6302642256", "6300248100", "0792841778", "6300184269"], "bought_together": ["6302642256"], "also_viewed": ["6300213005", "6304718551", "B00004TWZK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 283762}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.84, "brand": "", "asin": "6300183483", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Y7HZ8YX5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Last Starfighter [VHS]"}
{"description": "The peril facing a lone American amid Third World political turmoil is elegantly communicated in this important film from Costa-Gavras (Z), adapted by the director and Donald Stewart from Thomas Hauser's nonfiction book. The key to its power onscreen stems from the decision not to center the action merely on the disappearance of Charles Horman (John Shea), but also on the search for him by his father Ed (Jack Lemmon)--and on Ed's discovery of a son he never knew. The Oscar-winning script flows freely between that search and Charles's earlier experiences in the unnamed country (in the true account, Chile). Providing a link between those two stories is Charles's wife Beth (Sissy Spacek), who follows her father-in-law around a country in chaos, teeming with reckless authority and disinterested American diplomats (epitomized by ace character actor David Clennon). The film, which was nominated for a Best Picture Oscar and won the Cannes Film Festival's top prize, is certainly manipulative, but it works because of its finely detailed human elements. Usually emotionally extroverted, Lemmon gives one of his finest performances playing against that type--here, he's a controlled, intellectual man who learns more about his son, and his country, than he ever dreamed he would.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["630368680X"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 473764}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 24.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6300182738", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41FTK884GEL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Missing [VHS]"}
{"description": "The dialogue is laughable, and the plot is by the numbers. But if you're a surfer (or an armchair surfer), this ultra-silly movie may prove hard to resist. It's the one about the kid from Arizona (Matt Adler), who's surfed only on artificial waves in that landlocked state, coming out to spend his last free summer hitting the serious water of Hawaii. He falls in with a mystical surf guru (Gregory Harrison), one of those surf-Zen masters obsessed with the cosmic significance of hanging ten, but he's also tempted by the flashier stunts of the younger surf crowd.

{"description": "Jingoism, beefcake, military hardware, and a Giorgio Moroder rock score reign supreme over taste and logic in this Tony Scott film about a maverick trainee pilot (Tom Cruise) who can't follow the rules at a Navy aviation training facility. The dogfight sequences between American and Soviet jets at the end are absolutely mechanical, though audiences loved it at the time. The love story between Cruise's character and that of Kelly McGillis is like flipping through pages of advertising in a glossy magazine. This designer action movie from 1986 would be all the more appalling were it not for the canny casting of good actors in dumb parts.

{"description": "The quintessential movie spoof that spawned an entire genre of parody films, the originalAirplane!still holds up as one of the brightest comedic gems of the '80s, not to mention of cinema itself (it ranked in the top 5 ofEntertainment Weekly's list of the 100 funniest movies ever made). The humor may be low and obvious at times, but the jokes keep coming at a rapid-fire clip and its targets--primarily the lesser lights of '70s cinema, from disco films to star-studded disaster epics--are more than worthy for send-up. If you've seen even one of the overblownAirportmovies then you know the plot: the crew of a filled-to-capacity jetliner is wiped out and it's up to a plucky stewardess and a shell-shocked fighter pilot to land the plane. Robert Hays and Julie Hagerty are the heroes who have a history that includes a meet-cute &agrave; laSaturday Night Fever, a surf scene right out ofFrom Here to Eternity, a Peace Corps trip to Africa to teach the natives the benefits of Tupperware and basketball, a war-ravaged recovery room with a G.I. who thinks he's Ethel Merman (a hilarious cameo)--and those are just the flashbacks! The jokes gleefully skirt the boundaries of bad taste (pilot Peter Graves to a juvenile cockpit visitor: \"Joey, have you ever seen a grown man naked?\"), with the high (low?) point being Hagerty's intimate involvement with the blow-up automatic pilot doll, but they'll have you rolling on the floor. The film launched the careers of collaborators Jim Abrahams (Big Business), David Zucker (Ruthless People), and Jerry Zucker (Ghost), as well as revitalized such B-movie actors as Lloyd Bridges, Peter Graves, Robert Stack, and Leslie Nielsen, who built a second career on films like this.

Of course, it's a quaint curiosity by today's technological standards, but as produced by visual effects pioneer George Pal, this story of Earth's collision with a runaway star is still a dazzling example of screen sci-fi from the '50s, when special effects were entering a new stage of advancement. Despite scientists' warnings about the star's destructive potential, government officials refuse to take action that could cause international panic, but a consortium of private industrialists prepare for the worst by building a gigantic spaceship--an ark for humanity to begin life anew on a distant planet. Who will be chosen to go, and who left behind? As earthquakes roar and massive tidal waves devastate entire cities, the huge rocket prepares for take-off from its miles-long launching ramp--ready to abandon the shattered Earth!

{"description": "This 1986 comedy out of Australia is so old-fashioned in its romantic charm that one can't help but wonder what it would have looked like with Clark Gable and Carole Lombard in the leads. On the other hand, it's hard to imagine anyone besides Paul Hogan as the title character, a laid-back Aussie tracker who shows an American reporter (Linda Kozlowski) around bush country, then accompanies her to New York City. Sure, Hollywood has done the fish-out-of-water scenario to death in the last 20 years, and while this film has sufficient sport with the gimmick, it is largely driven by the principal characters and their developing love affair. Hogan cowrote the script and director Peter Faiman evokes the goofy, enchanted air of screwball comedies.

{"description": "Melanie Griffith had a fling with stardom in this Mike Nichols comedy about an executive secretary (Griffith) who can't get her deserved shot at upward mobility in the brokerage industry. Hardly taken seriously by male bosses, things aren't really any better for her once she starts working for a female exec (Sigourney Weaver, never more delightful), a narcissist with a boy-toy banker (Harrison Ford) and a tendency to steal the best ideas from her underlings. When Weaver's character is laid up with a broken leg, Griffith poses as a replacement wheeler-dealer, flirting with Ford and working on a new client who doesn't suspect the deception. Nichols brings a lot of snap and sass to Kevin Wade's smart script about chafing against class restrictions and perceptions. Sundry scenes are played quite charmingly, especially those of Griffith and Ford's mutual pickup in a bar and Joan Cusack's championing of Griffith's crusade. Nominated for Best Picture, Director, Actress (Griffith), and two Supporting Actress awards (Weaver, Cusack); Carly Simon's song \"Let the River Run\" won the Oscar.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300247171", "6300214680", "076780922X", "6302413435", "B00004CJW7", "B00329TVQA"], "also_viewed": ["6305123616"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 128934}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.94, "brand": "", "asin": "630141277X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71FMRW57JXL._SY300_.gif", "title": "Working Girl [VHS]"}

{"description": "Meticulously crafted but also ponderous and predictable, James Cameron's 1989 deep-sea close-encounter epic reaffirms one of the oldest first principles of cinema: everything moves a lot more slowly underwater. Ed Harris and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, as formerly married petroleum engineers who still have some \"issues\" to work out, are drafted to assist a gung-ho Navy SEAL (Michael Biehn) with a top-secret recovery operation: a nuclear sub has been ambushed and sunk, under mysterious circumstances, in some of the deepest waters on earth, and the petro-techies have the only submersible craft capable of diving down that far. Every image and every performance is painstakingly sharp and detailed (and the computerized water creatures are lovely) but the movie's lumbering pace is ultimately lethal. It's the audience that ends up feeling waterlogged. For a guy who likes guns as much as Cameron (his next film after all, was the body-count masterpieceTerminator&nbsp;2: Judgment Day), it's interesting that the moral balance here is weighted heavily in favor of the can-do engineers; the military types are end-justifies-the-means amoralists, just like the weasely government bureaucrats inAliens.--David Chute", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301208773", "0767825411", "6305363668", "1558808221", "6300247171", "B00006RCSC", "6303148352", "6303257844", "B00000JGEI", "6303942830", "6305142467", "6303313345", "B000003KHS", "630407185X", "6304233639", "6304071876", "6300214826", "B000005QWI", "6303020089", "6302909023", "6301562178", "0800132009", "B00000ILE6", "B0001VL30O", "0800116917", "6303269834", "B0000CDL3W", "079073799X", "0783222955", "6301628454", "B00007CVYA", "6305718792", "B000054OW2", "6304259131"], "also_viewed": ["B00000JGEI", "6301792734", "6305363668", "6300213668", "6301208773", "6304233639", "0800125762", "6300213730", "6303402348", "6300214435", "6304117752", "0671676253", "6302814782", "0792151712", "0790740265", "6303257844", "B002GHHHKQ", "6303313345", "B001AQO3QA", "B007SPPANM", "B0087F7VSY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 435209}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.96, "brand": "", "asin": "6301562941", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/11JCR407ZAL.jpg", "title": "Abyss [VHS]"}

{"description": "A flawed but stylish adaptation of the Chester Gould comic strip by director Warren Beatty, who also stars in the title role. The minimalist plot involves a battalion of baddies who confront the intrepid detective in a series of strung-together vignettes. Al Pacino is a comedic if overblown standout as Big Boy Caprice, and Madonna simply smolders as aggressive blonde bombshell Breathless Mahoney. It matters not that the plot is Spartan, as this dazzling eye candy is much enhanced by Stephen Sondheim's songs, including the Academy Award-winning ditty, \"Sooner or Later (I Always Get My Man).\" Beatty took his cue from the source material and concentrated on the relationships between these people, whether strained, romantic, or hateful. The performances are subtle and more amusing than you would expect from such a visually bold picture. Shot in bright, primary colors, this also won Oscars for Best Art/Set Direction and Makeup (for those inventively hideous criminals).

March's performance is pretty theatrical, but it's fun to watch; his Hyde twitches and squawks and lopes around like an ape in a tuxedo.

{"description": "Kevin Costner's lousy English accent is a small obstacle in this often exciting version of the Robin Hood fable. That aside, it's refreshing to have a preface to the old story in which we meet the robber hero of Sherwood Forest as a soldier in King Richard's Crusades, coming home to find his people under siege from the cruelties of the Sheriff of Nottingham (Alan Rickman). After Robin and his community of outcasts and fighters take to the trees, director Kevin Reynolds (Fandango,187) is on more familiar narrative ground, and he goes for the gusto with lots of original action (Robin shoots two arrows simultaneously from his bow in two directions). Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, as Marion, makes a convincing damsel in distress, and Morgan Freeman brings dignity to his role as Robin's Moor friend. Alan Rickman, however, gets the most attention for his scene-chewing role as the rotten sheriff, an almost campy performance that is highly entertaining but perhaps a little out of sorts with the rest of the film.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["0788802194", "0783235968", "6303909884", "0792839846"], "also_viewed": ["6302415853", "6303422926", "6302178924"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 303110}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 0.5, "brand": "", "asin": "6302206294", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Q09JK4QNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Robin Hood - Prince of Thieves [VHS]"}
{"description": "An unbelievable movie, and deliriously better for it. Keanu Reeves is a  hotshot law enforcement dude--Johnny Utah by name--investigating a series of  bank robberies in L.A. Four gunmen, disguised in rubber masks of ex-U.S.  presidents, have never come close to being caught, but veteran agent Gary Busey  has a theory: The bandits are surfers. This prompts the superb line, \"The ex-presidents rip off banks to finance the endless summer!\" This movie's full of  dialogue like that, but instead of sounding ridiculous it creates its own  infectious comic-book energy--ride the crest of it and you'll find the film's  giddy zone. Patrick Swayze plays Bodhi, zen-master leader of the surfing clan,  humming serenely with the wisdom of the waves. (Alarmingly, Swayze also did his  own skydiving stunts.) Director Kathryn Bigelow (Strange Days) stages the  action sequences with a visceral snap, and clearly has a gift for orchestrating  pulp fiction. Though not a huge hit when was first released,Point Breakhas a well-deserved cult reputation thanks to its video afterlife.

{"description": "Edgar Ulmer's baroque masterpiece is the pinnacle of expressionism of Hollywood, a beautiful melding of gothic antiquity and modernity in the shadow of World War&nbsp;I. Bela Lugosi and Boris Karloff square off in their  finest film together as decades-old nemeses who meet for a fateful showdown on the very battlefield where Karloff's devilish dark priest sacrificed his own army and framed Lugosi's good doctor for the crime. Karloff plays the most evil character of his career, a mesmerizingly demonic architect (inspired by the notorious real-life Satanist Aleister Crowley) who stole Lugosi's wife and daughter and built his shrinelike home, a stunning piece of Bauhaus-inspired glass and steel architecture, on the graves of his victims. His intensity and hypnotic understatement is a revelation, a genuine monster in human guise far more insidious and evil than the creatures of Universal's more famous horror classics. Lugosi delivers his finest performance ever as a Van Helsing-like hero whose simmering hatred and rage finally boils over into madness and sadistic revenge. A pair of silly American honeymooners become but two more pawns in their game of vengeance. John Mescall, who shot the gorgeousBride of Frankenstein, beautifully delivers eerie unease and sinister imagery, from the Caligari-like black church of slanting beams and slashing shadows to the tomb of glass-lined caskets displaying victims held in suspended animation. One of the finest horror films to emerge from Universal's golden age of horror.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302526140", "6302843200", "630252587X", "6302843227", "6302120101", "6300181278", "6302526175", "6300183084", "6303626475", "6302526086", "6303257801", "630252542X", "6303129188", "6300183092", "6302526094", "6300183629", "6301327845", "6303129161", "6302841844", "630018529X", "6302841763", "6300181286", "6301257014", "6300185281", "6303129153"], "bought_together": ["630252587X", "6302526175"], "also_viewed": ["B0009X770E", "630252587X", "6300183629", "6302843219", "6303506240", "6302843197", "6302526175", "6302841879", "630312917X", "6302526140", "6302526086", "6302843200", "6300181286", "6303129161", "B009AGF050"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 313004}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 26.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6302526191", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514RX5CNCKL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Black Cat [VHS]"}

{"description": "EDITOR'S NOTE: According to a Warner Home Video technician involved in  the production ofThe Stanley Kubrick Collection, Kubrick authorized all aspects of theCollection, from the use of Digital Component Video (or \"D-1\") masters originally approved in 1989, to the use of minimalist screen menus, chapter stops, and (in the case of2001: A Space OdysseyandThe Shiningon DVD) supplementary materials. Full-screen presentation ofThe ShiningandFull Metal Jacketwas also approved by Kubrick, who recomposed his original framing,  reportedly believing that those films looked best on video in the full-screen format. (In fact, the original theatrical aspect ratio ofThe Shiningwas 1.66:1, meaning that a relatively small portion of the image is lost.) Kubrick also chose mono over stereo,  believing that inconsistencies in theatrical sound systems resulted in loss of control over theatrical presentation. In every respect, the Warner spokesman  said, the films in theCollectionremain as Kubrick approved them. Any future attempt to remaster or alter them would  have to be approved by an appointee of the Kubrick estate.", "related": {"also_bought": ["0790705141", "0792839846", "6303402070", "0783221347", "0790731975", "0784011923", "6300182916", "6300216047", "0792842464", "6302360978", "6300185281", "6302054982", "6302120101", "B00005ATQA", "6305237115", "0790734079", "B001BZQMFA", "6300184110", "6300183416", "B00000J2L7", "B00000FZCU", "6300216500", "B000AMW2TK", "6301564456", "6300247171", "B00000JGEK", "630442972X", "B00005B238", "0790758474", "0790733927", "6303953425", "0783217528", "0792845684", "B00004W5UA", "0767825411", "6304429274", "6300183092", "6305363668", "0790734877", "B00000JRUB", "0783235607"], "bought_together": ["0790705141"], "also_viewed": ["B001993Y1S", "B008M4MB8K", "B00337QJO8", "B00GGAK0FS", "B00108E1GU", "B006JVPK2M", "6302610702", "B008MILL8C", "6300214826", "B001AQO3QA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 369746}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6302760046", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514N60SRJ4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]"}

For his change of heart, Orpheus and his new doomed lover are pursued by a vengeful Mira and a determined Death through the feverish Carnival night. Camus at once demystifies and remystifies the old story, shifting not only its location but its tone and context, forcing a reevaluation of the legend as a more passionate, pulsing, sensual experience.

Simon's jokes are mostly obvious, and the film's real appeal is the clever concept matched with fine--sometimes legendary--actors.

James Caan is at his free-spirited best as Piccolo, and Billy Dee Williams is very charming as the quiet Sayers destined for superstardom. Roommates and rivals, these two rookies soon become best friends because of their competitive natures and complementary personalities. When Piccolo becomes stricken with cancer, his relentless will to live inspires the talented Sayers to reach his athletic potential.

John Denver is the good man chosen to be God's contact in the modern age--and like an Old Testament prophet, Denver's character pays the price by being ridiculed and faced with criminal charges. Denver is a warm presence, but the film is entirely in Burns's court. Reiner feeds him lines that come out of Burns' mouth like stage patter, and it's no wonder he got a huge career boost from this film in the winter of his life.

(The film is not to be confused with Steven Spielberg's sequel toJurassic Park.) Just as Spielberg's dinosaur thrillers would advance the technology of computer-generated spectacle, Doyle's classic story provided a perfect opportunity to exploit the illusions made possible by stop-motion animation. Eight years before he stunned audiences with the amazing special effects ofKing Kong, pioneering stop-motion animator Willis O'Brien created the dinosaur stars of this classic silent-film fantasy. Following Doyle's plot, the film plays like a dress rehearsal forKing Kongand establishes a now-familiar scenario: Wallace Beery plays a visionary scientist who returns to the remote South African plateau where he'd earlier discovered a jungle haven of prehistoric creatures.  Determined to introduce this discovery to the world, he returns to London with a captive brontosaurus, which later escapes and goes on a destructive rampage through the city.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["630497342X"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 617027}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6303038786", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/214HP8TDKRL.jpg", "title": "Lost World [VHS]"}

{"description": "This is the movie that Leonardo DiCaprio received an Oscar nomination for, five years beforeTitanic. And, in fact, this is the movie that should have made him a star, he's so good in it. Based on the novel by Peter Hedges (who adapted his own book) and directed by Lasse Hallstr&ouml;m (My Life as a Dog), this is the funny, moody tale of a young man named Gilbert Grape (Johnny Depp) who lives at home in a small town with his 500-pound Momma (beautifully played by nonpro Darlene Cates), his mentally retarded younger brother Arnie (DiCaprio, utterly convincing), and his sisters. Not a lot happens--Arnie keeps climbing a water tower and getting stuck; Gilbert is involved with a married woman (Mary Steenburgen), then meets a nice new girl in town who's closer to his age (Juliette Lewis). And that's exactly what makes this movie so much more than your run-of-the-mill Hollywood product: it's not about some mechanical, formulaic plot; it's about these characters, and it allows you to spend some time with them and get to know them. Depp may have started out as a TV teen idol on21 Jump Street, but his feature film choices since then--in such wonderfully offbeat and diverse movies asCry-Baby,Edward Scissorhands,Benny & Joon,Donnie Brasco--have made him one of the most interesting, unpredictable, and risk-taking young actors in American movies.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301763041", "630018403X"], "bought_together": ["6301763041"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 216191}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.79, "brand": "", "asin": "6303124798", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51APPGGETRL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "What's Eating Gilbert Grape [VHS]"}

Susan Sarandon is the attorney who decides to look after the boy; nobody can match her when it comes to playing strong and protective maternal figures (Thelma and Louise,Lorenzo's Oil,Dead Man Walking). Sarandon won her fourth Oscar nomination as best actress for this role, before finally winning the following year forDead Man Walking.

{"description": "David Lean focused all his talent as an epic-maker on Boris Pasternak's sweeping novel about a doctor-poet in revolutionary Russia. The results may sometimes veer toward soap opera, especially with the screen frequently filled with adoring close-ups of Omar Sharif and Julie Christie, but Lean's gift for cramming the screen with spectacle is not to be denied. The streets of Moscow, the snowy steppes of Russia, the house in the country taken over by ice; these are re-created with Lean's unerring sense of grandness. The movie is so lush and so long that it becomes an irresistible wallow, even when logic suffers--likeGone with the Windbefore it andTitanicafter. Sharif, who achieved stardom in Lean's previous film,Lawrence of Arabia, mostly looks noble, but the supporting cast is spiky: Rod Steiger as a fat-cat monster, Tom Courtenay as a self-righteous revolutionary, and Klaus Kinski and Alec Guinness in smaller roles. Geraldine Chaplin, in her adult debut, plays the doctor's compliant wife.

Great fun, with nary a wasted frame and, in the character of Robert Newton's much-imitated Long John, one of cinema's most boisterously crowd-pleasing villains ever. (Proving that you can't keep a good--er, bad man down, Newton would return with director Byron Haskins for the enjoyable sequel,Long John Silver.)

{"description": "Akira Kurosawa's rousingSeven Samuraiwas a natural for an American remake--after all, the codes and conventions of ancient Japan and the Wild West (at least the mythical movie West) are not so very far apart. ThusThe Magnificent Seveneffortlessly turns samurai into cowboys (the same trick worked more than once: Kurosawa'sYojimbobecame Sergio Leone'sA Fistful of Dollars). The beleaguered denizens of a Mexican village, weary of attacks by banditos, hire seven gunslingers to repel the invaders once and for all. The gunmen are cool and capable, with most of the actors playing them just on the cusp of '60s stardom: Steve McQueen, James Coburn, Charles Bronson, Robert Vaughn. The man who brings these warriors together is Yul Brynner, the baddest bald man in the West. There's nothing especially stylish about the approach of veteran director John Sturges (The Great Escape), but the storytelling is clear and strong, and the charisma of the young guns fairly flies off the screen. If that isn't enough to awaken the 12-year-old kid inside anyone, the unforgettable Elmer Bernstein music will do it: bum-bum-ba-bum, bum-ba-bum-ba-bum....

{"description": "Best known for making movies about men and violence, director Walter Hill scored a misfire with this ambitious but ultimately dreary remake of Akira Kurosawa's samurai classicYojimbo. The story's essentially the same but the setting has been switched to a dusty, almost ghostly Texas town in the 1930s, where two rival Chicago gangs are locked in an uneasy truce. Bruce Willis plays the lone drifter who allies himself with both gangs to his own advantage, working both sides against each other according to his own hidden agenda. The violence escalates to a bloody climax, of course, with Christopher Walken, David Patrick Kelly, and Michael Imperioli as trigger-happy lieutenants in a lonely, desolate war. Fans of gangster movies will want to see this, and, if nothing else, Hill has brought his polished style to a vaguely mythic story. It's far from being a classic, however, and although its action is at times masterfully choreographed, the movie's humorless attitude is unexpectedly oppressive.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783226888", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B00562I40K", "B002AS466O", "0767807588", "B002UZCJ8Y", "B005R08HJY", "0767821513", "B000FFL2G6", "B00000JDIQ", "0780618548", "B00005JKTP", "B000XT1P4S", "B003Q6D2B4", "B009HIKAN8", "B000RETOH4", "B000QUCRB4", "B00BLF9FOK", "B002AT8K9W", "B0058ZPNBI", "0767817710", "B00AEBB9NM", "B000056PNL", "B000095WW8", "B003AWRMCE", "B000P0J0AG", "B002ZG96ZC", "B000FKO5QK", "B00AEFYUQQ", "B00008RH3L", "B002ZG999U", "B002GHHHP6", "B002VWNICC", "0767802519", "B008E70EES", "B0045HCJG2", "B0000TANUI", "B002QEHPQU", "B00005UQ9T", "B00004Y87N", "B008JFURII", "B000O78KW4", "6305263248", "B0062P3392", "B000E5N6LG", "B0010YVCB6", "B003L20IG0", "6305767866", "B0045HCJ5S", "6304711891", "B0045HCIWW", "B003ASLJIQ", "B005LAIGRS", "6304806434", "B0068MNNS0", "B00011CZRE", "B001LRJH0U", "B000BRP4BM", "B00AEFXVOI", "B000XR9L50", "B003ASLJRC", "B00BUAEYVK", "B003ASLJS6", "B003ASLJOU", "B004ULNJIU", "B00003CY5A", "B00005JLX2", "B00AEFXT1S", "B002AT8KA6", "B00AEFY6PQ", "B002FU8IWU", "B00AEBB86A", "B00BEIYN9Q", "B0007PALZ2", "1558908846", "B001UV4XGA", "B001LMAK88", "B001R3YRG2", "B00AG51V8E", "B001N44BVQ", "B000CQLZ0Q", "B005LAIILM", "B0000DI87S", "B000NOIVT0", "B002DU39GW", "B0043X1FLI", "B004A8ZX28", "B00004STDN", "B003AWRMBA", "B002GHHHME", "B00005V4XW", "B000J4QWMC", "B004EPYZOO", "B00388PK7O", "B005S9ELVC", "B001B3LIOC", "B00AS1Q93S", "B00008K76U", "B00005JLQN", "B009MF5BXK"], "bought_together": ["B00AEFYYWQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003F18008", "B0009ETCUQ", "B002GSXKNS", "B00AEFYYWQ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 23129}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.52, "brand": "New Line Studios", "asin": "6304698747", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51TWD0Y9QDL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Last Man Standing"}

{"description": "TakeThe Full Monty, add a sharper emotional edge, and replace the strutting strippers with a dignified British band. That's the essence ofBrassed Off, a bittersweet gem released in 1996, a year before its more popular (and Oscar-nominated) counterpart. In the Yorkshire town of Grimley, there has always been a coal mine, just as for the last 111 years there has been a brass band, and it seems that Danny (the wondrous Pete Postlethwaite) has been the director for every one of those years.  Tory economic policies, however, are closing coal mines around the country in favor of nuclear power, and Grimley appears to be next on the list.  Danny is unfazed by the threat, claiming, \"It's music that matters.\"  But some of the men are about to quit the band until the appearance of Gloria (Tara Fitzgerald at her most radiant), who dazzles the all-male group (including old flame Andy, played by Ewan McGregor) first with her beauty, then with her fl&uuml;gelhorn playing. The new member gives the band a boost as they continue to perform and compete, but closure remains very real, as director Mark Herman (Little Voice) accompanies the band's performances (played with gusto by theGrimethorpe Colliery Band) with scenes of angry labor-management confrontations and family strife.  In this context, some of the characters claim that the music is an irresponsible form of escapism.

{"description": "In the opening scene of this thoroughly mindless action flick, a psycho holds a group of terrified hostages in a grocery store, and yells to renegade cop Marion Cobretti (Sylvester Stallone) that he's going to blow the place to kingdom come. &quot;Go ahead,&quot; says the cop nicknamed &quot;Cobra,&quot; presumably because he's tightly coiled and strikes with deadly force. &quot;I don't shop here.&quot; And so it goes with this brutal and for the most part disgusting Stallone showcase, in which Sly's then wife, Brigitte Nielsen, provides bad acting and ample cleavage as a fashion model (what else?) who's the only witness against a crazed cult of serial killers. Cobra likes to kill first and leave the questions to his disgruntled superiors, who call on the maverick lawman when all other options have failed.

{"description": "Asian American director Ang Lee sums up America in the early 1970s by focusing on the arrival of the sexual revolution in the 'burbs. Isolationism within a family, consumerism, and selfishness are personified by a cast that captures the self-obsession within two New England families. As the children struggle awkwardly with adolescence, their parents stumble through sexual experimentation. In the days of Watergate and Vietnam, society is breaking boundaries and ignoring convention. Following suit, these families are eschewing polite barriers and social taboos, with disastrous results. The \"ice storm\" of the title refers not only to a natural phenomenon but is a (rather heavy-handed) metaphor for a pervasive emotional temperament. The entire cast delivers textured, finely nuanced performances. This movie lingers in the psyche not only for the scope of the tragedy at its conclusion, but for Lee's often humorous and stingingly accurate assessment of pop culture. Based on Rick Moody's novel, this won the best-screenplay award at Cannes in 1997.--Rochelle O'Gorman", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 146644}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.0, "brand": "", "asin": "6304844964", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4125A7MPSWL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Ice Storm [VHS]"}

{"description": "One of the greatest screen biographies ever produced, this monumental film runs nearly three hours, won seven Academy Awards, and gave George C. Scott the greatest role of his career. It was released in 1970 when protest against the Vietnam War still raged at home and abroad, and many critics and moviegoers struggled to reconcile current events with the movie's glorification of Gen. George S. Patton as a crazy-brave genius of World War II.How could a movie so huge in scope and so fascinated by its subject be considered an anti-war film? The simple truth is that it's not--Patton is less about World War II than about the rise and fall of a man whose life was literally defined by war, and who felt lost and lonely without the grand-scale pursuit of an enemy. George C. Scott embodies his role so fully, so convincingly, that we can't help but be drawn to and fascinated by Patton as a man who is simultaneously bound for hell and glory. The film's opening monologue alone is a masterful display of acting and character analysis, and everything that follows is sheer brilliance on the part of Scott and director Franklin J. Schaffner.Filmed on an epic scale at literally dozens of European locations, Patton does not embrace war as a noble pursuit, nor does it deny the reality of war as a breeding ground for heroes. Through the awesome achievement of Scott's performance and the film's grand ambition, Patton shows all the complexities of a man who accepted his role in life and (like Scott) played it to the hilt.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303057225", "0800132009", "B0007TKNGA", "6304071876", "6302909023", "6301966317", "6300181472", "B000059HGY", "6300214826", "6300268748", "079213690X", "630407185X", "B00000K3AN", "6301797906", "6301115430", "079284646X", "0790701251", "0790752395", "6302529441", "0783221347", "B00000F13T", "6300216543", "B00006C7G9", "6304151306", "B00005LL26", "630018224X", "6301971809", "6301965817", "6300181340", "630442972X", "6300988473", "630105573X", "0783216084", "6301777867", "B00003CXTF", "B000003KDG", "6303020089", "6301969251", "B000003KHS", "B00004CNR5", "6301662954", "0784011923", "B00000FZCU", "6300215962", "0800100832", "1569942072", "B00003CXE6", "6300271846", "6300181154", "630274721X", "0790734079", "0764004638", "0800125762", "6302415853", "6301976622", "630018627X", "B00005A1VG", "B000007OY0", "B000068TSI", "B00005ATQA", "0800116917", "6300216802", "6303696813", "6300267830", "0790758474", "0792116887", "0783235607", "630197154X", "B00005Q4GY", "B0000048YO", "6302224330", "0800106032", "6303824358", "B000056BRF", "6304457278", "6300267938", "6300182304"], "bought_together": ["6303057225"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 219212}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.74, "brand": "", "asin": "6304935811", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/418V1BMMHEL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Patton [VHS]"}

{"description": "\"I won't give you nothing, man; I give you shit,\" sneers charismatic superstar Chow Yun Fat, speaking English (with a De Niro accent) in his role as a New York restaurateur who won't knuckle under to the (Italian) mob. Chow plays the twin brother of the character he played in the originalTomorrow, the ultraviolent, ultraromantic ultrapopular Hong Kong gangster melodrama. And the blatancy of that device is a fair indication of the sequel's shortcomings--and of its screwy charm: this is a film that knows no shame. The bond between the natural siblings played by Ti Lung (as a reformed mobster) and Leslie Cheung (as a hot shot cop) still resonate tellingly. As a good-guy ex-thug driven batty by the slaying of his only daughter, real-life Cinema City studio chief Dean Shek gets to play a garishly extended \"mad scene,\" foaming at the mouth, chewing on soup bones. A later episode in which a dying man crawls to a phone booth to call his wife (and newborn daughter) in the hospital must also be some kind of lurid first in the soap sweepstakes. The final 15 minutes could be the bloodiest single shoot-out sequence ever committed to celluloid.

{"description": "Saturday Night Feverit's not--call it more likeSunday  Morning Leftovers. This portrait of the legendary Manhattan disco and its colorful cofounder, Steve Rubell, plays like the outtakes of a much more interesting film--where's the sex, the drugs, the classic disco music? (It shouldn't surprise viewers that Miramax and writer-director Mark Christopher had a falling-out over the final cut of the film; Miramax prevailed.) Considering that the essence of Studio&nbsp;54 was about the rich and beautiful, it seems a bit unwise to focus on the poor and  only-somewhat-beautiful, namely Shane (Ryan Phillippe), a Jersey boy who gets taken in by the razzle-dazzle of the disco era. Crossing the river, Shane finds another, more exciting life at Studio&nbsp;54 as a shirtless bartender, and soon finds himself partying with the cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me--and  smitten with comely soap star Julie (Neve Campbell). The permutations of the story are familiar; if you've never seen VH1'sBehind the Musicdocumentary take on Studio&nbsp;54 you'll find this film enjoyable, but unlike that exhaustive portrait, too many elements are missing. Most of Phillippe's performance seems to have ended up on the cutting-room floor (although his chiseled torso gets maximum exposure), Campbell's role is basically a glorified cameo, and Breckin Meyer and Salma Hayek, as Phillippe's only true pals, are wasted. The one true gem of the film, though, is Mike Myers's take on the late Steve Rubell, an inspired high-wire performance that balances humor and tragedy without ever giving in to camp or pathos. Had this been a more well-received movie, he'd be remembered come Oscar time--his drunken proposition of Philippe is a minor treasure. The soundtrack does feature some unknown chestnuts and a few new remixes, including an inspired disco version of--believe it or not--Gordon Lightfoot's \"If You Could Read My Mind.\"--Mark Englehart", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 272112}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6305210144", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71Z4BW48N8L._SY300_.gif", "title": "54 [VHS]"}
{"description": "When the Western slipped into theatrical oblivion in the late 1970s, many of the best examples of the genre began appearing as made-for-television films. After the success ofThe Sacketts, from the Louis L'Amour novel, producers quickly reunited stars Tom Selleck and Sam Elliott in another fine adaptation of aL'Amour book,The Shadow  Riders. As brothers Mac and Dal Traven, sporting blue and gray uniforms, respectively, they wind their way home at the close of the Civil War to discover a band of confederate rebels have ravaged their town and kidnapped their sisters and brother and Dal's feisty sweetheart (Katharine Ross). With the help of their outlaw uncle (Western stalwart Ben Johnson), whom they must break out of prison, they track the guerrillas to the Gulf Coast and down into Mexico for a final, fatal showdown. Veteran director Andrew McLaglen sets this TV movie on a loping pace and a jovial tone, defined largely by Selleck's easygoing performance and the jocular comic relief of rascally Johnson. Elliott provides the intensity, at times positively ferocious under his heavy brows and burning, sunken eyes. The mood is occasionally too comic, but McLaglen delivers the goods in a series of gritty action sequences, proving that old Western directors don't die, they just drift on over to the small screen. Western icons R.G. Armstrong and Harry Carey Jr. and 1950s leading lady Jane Greer also appear in key roles.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000EOTUSK", "B002LII6PU", "B0035JHYJI", "B003NF97MQ", "B0007OY2NA", "B00005LOL0", "B001KO1BCQ", "B001B187MU", "B0007OY2OE", "B001B187NO", "B000GFRI4K", "B00007G78A", "B009INAI02", "B002C4N66M", "B000EOTUSU", "B000SK5Z7A", "B0080QOLGA", "B007PXYWNQ", "B0002S94C0", "B002NALPBS", "B00368PSKK", "B000ANVPP6", "B0083H6APG", "B000EZ8ZRQ", "B00116GEJS", "B00744WZ6W", "B004QOB8UC", "B005DEUER2", "B00A0KBE8M", "B001LMAK88", "B00CEAXE1G", "B00A92MF6Q", "B00DZUV0M4", "B000O599YE", "B0018PH3L0", "B0007OY2OO", "B0024396EW", "B000OVLBFS", "B003ES5JJ2", "B00AEFXUL2", "B00008CMR4", "B006VRRGOO", "B00368PSKU", "B00116GEK2", "B00008CMR6", "B001AR0D54", "B005HT3ZZQ", "B0038EGD3I", "B00AMDA2OY", "B00A92MD8G", "B00AEBB8W4", "B000N3SSBW", "B0045HCJSK", "B00EU8RBXW", "B00008CMT3", "B001NVV7G6", "B00005JLV5", "B00004TX5G", "B000O599Y4", "0783228031", "6305161984", "B00E3QJ8DC", "B003ASLJRC", "B0001GF2KQ", "B000ANVPPQ", "B0002I833Q", "B00AEBBA0E", "B000OVLBG2", "B001QIP59G", "B000OT6V0U", "B000FTCLQC", "078322592X", "B004HHX9T6", "B004KDYQYY", "B0055SJY86", "B00080M9XI", "B00005ASGH", "B00AEFYPHA", "B00004Z4ST", "B00009AOAW", "B0055SJWDI", "B00008MTW7", "B00008MTW5", "B000O59A0C", "B00AEB70V2", "B000059TFU", "B00029NLLY", "B000056H2H", "B00005JLHX", "B0007MAO0C"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000EOTUSK", "B0035JHYJI", "B00005LOL0", "B002LII6PU"]}, "price": 9.12, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 208531}, "asin": "6305214522", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51B1MHEP4EL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Shadow Riders"}
{"description": "Francis Ford Coppola was working as an assistant to Roger Corman when he made this, his feature debut.  The story goes that Corman let Coppola make the film so long as he could work around the shooting schedule of the film they were working on together, and the results are impressive given the budget constraints. Or maybebecauseof the budget constraints.  The story concerns the family at Castle Haloran, the secrets surrounding the death of young Kathleen, and an axe murderer who seems to be picking away at all present.  Coppola's deft direction keeps this from being a routine ghost story, using light and dark in his compositions to create tension and suspense.  The film has an interesting way of spanning the traditional ghost story and the more modern gore-fests that we're used to.  I have one bone to pick with the manufacturer of this disc: the transfer to DVD was made from tape.  This is evident from the way the frames roll repeatedly during the last 15 minutes of the film, and the tape bunches a few times leaving video artifacts.

{"description": "Werner Herzog's remake of F.W. Murnau'soriginal vampire classicis at once a generous tribute to the great German director and a distinctly unique vision by one of cinema's most idiosyncratic filmmakers. Though Murnau'sNosferatuwas actually an unauthorized adaptation of Bram  Stoker'sDracula, Herzog based his film largely on Murnau's conceptions--at times directly quoting Murnau's images--but manages to slip in a few references to Tod Browning'sfamous version(at one point the vampire comments on the howling wolves: \"Listen, the children of the night make their music.\"). Longtime Herzog star Klaus Kinski is both hideous and melancholy as Nosferatu (renamed Count Dracula in the English language version). As in Murnau's film, he's a veritable gargoyle with his bald pate and sunken eyes, and his talon-like fingernails and two snaggly fangs give him a distinctly feral quality. But Kinski's haunting eyes also communicate a gloomy loneliness--the curse of his undead immortality--and his yearning for Lucy (Isabelle Adjani) becomes a melancholy desire for love. Bruno Ganz's sincere but foolish Jonathan is doomed to the vampire's will and his wife, Lucy, a holy innocent whose deathly pallor and nocturnal visions link her with the ghoulish Nosferatu, becomes the only hope against the monster's plague-like curse. Herzog's dreamy, delicate images and languid pacing create a stunningly beautiful film of otherworldly mood, a faithful reinterpretation that by the conclusion has been shaped into a quintessentially Herzog vision.--Sean Axmaker", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 272814}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "title": "Nosferatu the Vampyre [VHS]", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000056NW6", "6302783356", "B000VUQ4HW", "6304509154"], "also_viewed": ["6302194296", "B00EO2I6RO"]}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5123FXMFFAL._SY300_.jpg", "asin": "630526323X"}

{"description": "You might have heard people say they'd kill to get into Harvard. Well, here's a film that takes it literally.  There's a legendary rule at many universities, so the film posits, that if your roommate commits suicide you can take a 4.0&nbsp;GPA for the semester.  Tim (Matthew Lillard ofScreamfame, in yet another of his patented psycho roles) plans with his roommate Chris (Michael Vartan) to kill a third roommate Rand (Randall Batinkoff) so they can collect their 4.0s and get Chris a Harvard M.B.A.  As Chris says, \"Either it's a Harvard M.B.A. or you're flipping burgers.\"  No elevated thinker, Chris.  Rand is a cruel jerk to his Sandy Dennis-like girlfriend, Natalie (Tamara Craig Thomas), so it's hard to miss him when he's gone.  But that sentiment applies equally to nearly every other character in the picture, including Chris's girlfriend Emma (Keri Russell), who seems to be the most sympathetic of the group.  That's the movie's strength; you think you know everyone but you don't.  And that's also its greatest weakness; you need to know and like these people for the film to work.  If you can stomach these people (in which case counseling might be in order), the exceedingly twisty-turny plot  will keep you entertained to the last amazing revelation.  Otherwise, you might want to keep searching for a thriller that gives its people an inner life worth viewing.The Curvewas snatched from Sundance for a distribution deal by Trimark, but wound up in this direct-to-video release instead.--Jim Gay", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792840127", "0767824954", "0767837398", "B000F5WR4W", "B007XF0W3K", "B00003CXUP", "B004P7CN7W", "B00344EAN2", "B00005O5AX", "B00005JKJJ", "B000KHYN9C", "B002GHHHL0", "B00AEBB8QK", "B00BNWWVFG", "B002CVQAX6", "B0053TWVQE", "B000NJMJHK", "0783226845", "B00DNF1R74", "B000A0GP0Y", "B00A47BT7C", "B00BNWWUDY", "B00BDZV8ZM", "B00004YA67", "B000MV8ABS", "B009AMAJPA", "B000FFJZO2", "B00441GYVA", "0790736411", "B002LMSWN2", "B00013RC7K", "B0002WT4OE", "B000PAAJVU", "B004SUDQ1I", "6305065551", "B001URA5Y8", "B00005KAQP", "B00003CXKM", "B000WMFZK6", "B00BCMT2BI", "0792846443", "B000ASATZ8", "B00005UQ9W", "B000053VB2", "B00979KQD6", "B000CPH9PM", "6304711891", "B00006ZXSL", "B002ZG983M", "1573625779", "B0006N2EZ0", "B00AEFXT1S", "B00003CXPS", "B004HZY8OS", "B00004ZESE"], "bought_together": ["0767824954", "B004P7CN7W"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B009POCG2C", "0767824954"]}, "price": 5.96, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 71766}, "asin": "6305375577", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51SW1SWSGEL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Curve"}

{"description": "There's Something About Maryis one of the funniest movies in years, recalling the days of the Zucker-Abraham-Zucker movies, in which (often tasteless) gags were piled on at a fierce rate.

WithMary, they've created a consistently hilarious romantic comedy, made all the funnier by the fact that you know that they know that some of their gags go way over the line.Cameron Diaz stars as Mary, every guy's ideal.

{"description": "OK, let's get all the disclaimers out of the way first. Despite its colorful (if crude) animation,South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncutis in no way meant for kids. It is chock full of profanity that might even make Quentin Tarantino blanch and has blasphemous references to God, Satan, Saddam Hussein (who's sleeping with Satan, literally), and Canada. It's rife with scatological humor, suggestive sexual situations, political incorrectness, and gleeful, rampant vulgarity. And it's probably one of the most brilliant satires ever made. The plot: flatulent Canadian grossmeistersTerrance and Philip hit the big screen, and the South Park quartet of third graders--Stan, Kyle, Kenny, and Cartman--begin repeating their profane one-liners ad infinitum. The parents of South Park, led by Kyle's overbearing mom, form \"Mothers Against Canada,\" blaming their neighbors to the north for their children's corruption and taking Terrance and Philip as war prisoners. It's up to the kids then to rescue their heroes from execution, not mention a brooding Satan, who's planning to take over the world.To give away any more of the plot would destroy the fun, but this feature-length version of Trey Parker and Matt Stone's Comedy Central hit is a dead-on and hilarious send-up of pop culture. And did we mention it's amusical? From the opening production number \"Mountain Town\" to the cheerful antiprofanity sing-along \"It's Easy, MMMKay\" to Satan's faux-Disney ballad \"Up There,\" Parker (who wrote or cowrote all the songs) brilliantly shoots down every earnest musical fromBeauty and the BeasttoLes Mis&eacute;rables. And in advocating free speech and satirizing well-meaning but misguided parental censorship groups (with a special nod to the MPAA),Bigger, Longer & Uncuthits home against adult paranoia and hypocrisy with a vengeance. And the jokes, while indeed vulgar and gross, are hysterical; we can't repeat them here, especially the lyrics to Terrance and Philip's hit song, but you'll be rolling on the floor.

{"description": "Sean Connery plays a master thief thought to be long retired, while Catherine Zeta-Jones is his foil, a hotshot insurance investigator assigned to his case. They both have a little something to hold over each other's heads, until it turns out that Zeta-Jones is a professional art thief herself and is playing on both sides of the fence. At first they eye each other with mutual distrust until they team up for a job, which goes off without a hitch. Inevitably their prickly relationship begins to thaw somewhat, and the two become attracted to each other as they plan out the massive Y2K bank scam that is the movie's climax (complete with sequel-ready ending).Entrapmentplays somewhat like a '70s caper movie revamped for the gadget-happy high-tech '90s. The plot takes a few too many labored twists and turns, and the chemistry between the two leads is nearly nonexistent, though both carry on gamely in their parts. On the other hand, there is some genuine suspense in many scenes as they go about their business, dripping with whiz-bang burglary devices. Zeta-Jones, of course, is drop-dead gorgeous, and Connery is as reliable as always in his role.

{"description": "One of the most ambitious animated films to come out of Japan (or anywhere, for that matter),Perfect Blueis an adult psycho-thriller that uses the freedom of the animated image to create the subjective reality of a young actress haunted by the ghost of her past identity. Mima is a singer who leaves her teeny-bop trio to become an actress in a violent television series, a career move that angers her fans, who prefer to see her as the pert, squeaky-clean pop idol. Plagued by self-doubt and tormented by humiliating compromises, she begins to be stalked, in her waking and sleeping moments, by an accusing alter ego who claims to be \"the real Mima,\" until she collapses into madness as her coworkers are brutally slain around her. Director Satoshi Kon, adapting the novel by Yoshikazu Takeuchi, shows us the world from her schizophrenic perspective: days blur, dreams cross over into the waking world, the TV show blends into her real life, until her life merges with her part and she can't separate the ghosts from the real-life stalkers. Though the pat ending sweeps the psychosis and anxiety away with nary an emotional scar, it remains a smart, stylish thriller and one of the most intelligent and compelling uses of animation in recent years. Though tame by the extreme standards of \"adult anime,\" there is nudity and a few sexually provocative scenes, and the animation is detailed and stylized (if somewhat stiff and jerky by Disney  standards).--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["6304123523", "6304198833", "6303104371", "B00441GYS8", "6303305520", "B00005JLET", "B00002JWYZ", "B00004REO0", "1603090428", "B00000JSIK"], "also_viewed": ["B0001EFTVA", "B000VWYJ5Y", "B004DMIIPA", "B0009RQS7I", "B00ENNA62W", "B0000AK80C", "B008XEZXYI", "B0011FNDV6", "6303305520"]}, "price": 64.88, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 757563}, "asin": "6305668353", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/519PESSKE0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Perfect Blue (rated edition) [VHS]"}

He might as well be speaking for the  legions of fans of the original episodes in theStar Warssaga  who can't help but secretly ask themselves: Sure, this isStar  Wars, but is itmy Star Wars? The original elevated  moviegoers' expectations so high that it would have been impossible for  any subsequent film to meet them. And as with all theStar Warsmovies,The Phantom Menacefeatures inexplicable plot twists, a  fistful of loose threads, and some cheek-chewing dialogue. Han Solo's  swagger is sorely missed, as is the pervading menace of heavy-breathing  Darth Vader. There is still way too much quasi-mystical mumbo jumbo,  and some of what was fresh aboutStar Wars22 years earlier  feels formulaic. Yet there's much to admire. The special effects are  stupendous; three worlds are populated with a m&eacute;lange of creatures, flora, and horizons rendered in absolute  detail. The action and battle scenes are breathtaking in their  complexity. And one particular sequence of the film--the  adrenaline-infused pod race through the Tatooine desert--makes the chariot race inBen-Hurlook like a Sunday stroll through the park.Among the host of new characters, there are a few familiar walk-ons. We  witness the first meeting between R2-D2 and C-3PO, Jabba the Hutt looks  younger and slimmer (but not young and slim), and Yoda is as crabby as  ever. Natalie Portman's stately Queen Amidala sports hairdos that make  Princess Leia look dowdy and wields a mean laser. We never bond with  Jedi Knight Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson), and Obi-Wan's day is yet to come. Jar Jar Binks, a cross  between a Muppet, a frog, and a hippie, provides many of the movie's lighter moments, while Sith Lord Darth  Maul is a formidable force. Baby-faced Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd) looks too young  and innocent to command the powers of the Force or wield a lightsaber (much less transmute into the future Darth Vader), but his  boyish exuberance wins over skeptics.Near the end of the movie, Palpatine, the new leader of the Republic,  may be speaking for fans eagerly awaitingEpisode IIwhen he  pats young Anakin on the head and says, \"We will watch your career with  great interest.\" Indeed! --Tod Nelson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000633ZP", "6301792734", "B00005JLXH", "B00006HBUJ", "6304539258", "6304539274", "6301792769", "B000FQVX78", "6304539290", "0792158261", "B000FQJAJG", "6304117752", "0767729307", "B001GQSY5K", "6304178352", "B000FAGGWQ", "B00BBND56G", "B000FQJAIW", "B00005LL26", "B00003CXCT", "B00003CXI0", "B002I9Z8AS", "B00006AL1C", "B00CFWWDWE", "B000066HAS", "B000001ON6", "B000MUANT6", "6305587159"], "bought_together": ["B00005JLXH", "B00006HBUJ"], "also_viewed": ["B00006HBUJ", "B00005JLXH", "B00E9PMML2", "B0000633ZP", "6301792734", "B00BBND56G", "6304539258", "6301792769", "6304539274", "B00006JDUE", "0767729307", "B00E9PMMX0", "B000FQJAIW", "B000FQVX78", "B000FQJAJG", "B00000IQMT", "B000FAGGWQ", "B003ZSJ212", "0345434110", "6303148352", "6304089767", "0439834775", "6304117752", "B00BUZW14M", "6304500831", "0590010891", "0345341465", "6304434340", "B001GQSY5K", "155890641X", "B00005LL26", "6302961572", "0792151712", "B003W77SEO", "B000M4Y8JI", "0767825411", "B00003CXXI", "B00000IZ8A", "B00169IZN8", "6302787068", "B00006G8LB", "080010367X", "0800125762", "6302091632", "0792158261", "B000850IS6", "6300214826", "6303506291", "B00005V1Z8", "B000641D2Y", "0784011923", "B00008Y47S", "6300214060", "630382790X", "B00003CXI0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 79460}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.44, "brand": "Star Wars", "asin": "630575067X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41SJPKK4S4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Star Wars - Episode I, The Phantom Menace [VHS]"}

{"description": "Hard-boiled film noir masquerading as a women's melodrama, Strange Impersonation is a twisted tale of jealousy, murder, revenge and facial disfigurement from director Anthony Mann (T-Men, Raw Deal).  Brenda Marshall stars as Nora Goodrich, a single-minded scientist who spurns marriage for the sake of her pioneering work with anesthetics. When her jealous lab partner (Hillary Brooke) sabotages an experiment, Nora's face is badly scarred and -- through a twist of fate -- she swaps identities with a devious blackmailer (Ruth Ford), letting the world believe she is dead. Under the guise of Jane Karaski, Nora has her face surgically altered, establishes a new career and works her way back into the lives of her former enemies and lovers, where she can carry out her carefully plotted revenge.  On the surface, Strange Impersonation resembles an ordinary B Movie. But beneath its melodramatic exterior are all the dark ironies, violent outbursts and dynamic visuals that would become the trademark of director Anthony Mann, perhaps the most influential director of American film noir.", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 351225}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "title": "Strange Impersonation", "related": {"also_bought": ["B008BSM1CI", "B00CVB6XF2", "B00AEBBA9U", "B00H8J2NTC", "B00AR30KRI", "B0043FV94Y", "B00FPUN4BM", "B004J2FJ24", "B0043RMOYQ", "B00D2CRZ60", "B00BFWKE6C", "B004CZZZ0O", "B00B27WQ6G", "B00BM4Q46M", "B009TTGLJM", "B00CGCKFEG", "B00005Y70Q", "B00HLSSC7M", "B0006IUDVC", "B000FMGTPS", "B00I9BU3L8", "B000641ZPO", "B0009OL8IK", "B00FERSVIC", "B004LB5FEA", "B000098ZT0", "B0002F6BI8", "B0086IMP9M", "B00FX6U19Q", "B000CEXGDC", "B000BGH2N6", "B004TPJMZ6", "B0099VUWEA", "B0009OL92A", "B0026YA0BM", "B0006UEVVI", "B00E21D9ME", "B008NNSCKQ", "B00FX6TYZS", "B0089BSLTY", "B005DI94HE", "B00E6AVGKI", "B007KW5NG2", "B00008J2MC", "B0079R1LNM", "B008Y1YJAE", "B00CN70WS8", "B00CGCKFUK", "B00AOO5NZE", "B00C3ALM20", "B000HC2LLM", "078323208X", "B001JP64YG", "B0071EKL98", "B00B27WRA6", "B0000C8AVT", "B0081SGLBU", "B00AOO5QVK", "B00005Y6XA", "B000BKXAG0", "B0081W1TZE", "B00A1AU68A", "B00BM4Q4PI", "B00006L92X", "B007RUZ2IG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00D09AXUA", "B009X919UE", "B00AOO5OY4"]}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21XP9JN2ZWL.jpg", "asin": "6305950660"}

{"description": "Lucio \"King of the Eyeball Gag\" Fulci made his name  with a series of gory, gooey horror epics, andThe Beyondstands above  all as his outr&eacute; masterpiece. The largely incoherent plot has something to do  with a turn-of-the-century curse and a doorway to hell in the cellar of an old New Orleans hotel. Fulci shows his usual sensitivity with wooden acting, clumsy  dialogue, and buckets of oozing blood and pus, but don't let that get in  the way of enjoying this mad tale of zombies from hell  invading Earth and eating their way through a cast of humans: crucified martyrs, blind  visionaries, creepy hotel handymen, befuddled cops, and a plucky pair of  heroes desperately fleeing a horde of hungry undead. The blood-red art  direction is eerily beautiful, and Fulci's relentless long takes, punctuated by jolting shock cuts and eruptions of grotesque violence, create a mood  of sheer paranoid horror right down to the final, mind-bending image. And  don't forget the Fulci claim to fame: eyes are gouged out, eaten away,  melted with acid, and (shudder) popped out by a spike through the back of  the skull. Yech! If you dare ignore such piddling details as narrative  logic and let yourself get carried away on the creepy visuals, it's a  deliciously stylish treat, an edgy bit of gothic gore pitched in all its  bone-crunching, flesh-ripping, organ-splatting glory. This sadistic,  sanguinary hell-spawn tale is for gore-hounds only.The DVD features chatty but largely jokey commentary by David Warbeck and  Catriona MacColl and an alternate German credits sequence featuring Fulci's preferred sepia-tinged prologue (but no alternate footage).--Sean  Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0036R92US", "B0057O6IMS", "B0002C9DK4", "B004FUPK6U", "B000S0GYRU", "B004KDYR20", "B001D5C1R6", "B000S0GYRK", "B002E01MHY", "B000KRNG54", "B0036R92UI", "B0057O6IDW", "B000T28POC", "B00LMBUR6S", "B001OBBS4Q", "B000HXDWNM", "B000096I9V", "B000MV8ZCW", "B000JU7JIW", "B00000IBRJ", "B000TZJCMS", "B00009WNXA", "B0007WQHI0", "B003NEQ74S", "B008DRKJ76", "B000HXDWRS", "B001AR0D6I", "B000YKI4U4", "B002E01MI8", "B00ARWX9NG", "B000S0GYRA", "B004WMOSKA", "B004FUPK3I", "B001B187L6", "B00LMBURDG", "B00000JT2R", "B003L1YESE", "B0002VYOVS", "B005ZHBEPI", "B000063K1F", "B0026LYMJ6", "B00004Z1GI", "0783228457", "B00005NG08", "B00LBFFR2Y", "B000RPCK2O", "B000TZJCNC", "B000AC7P5Q", "B00005KH30", "B008BWFOXM", "B000TZJCN2", "B00BCMSY80", "B000S0GYS4", "B005OT7ZWI", "B002GPVDMG", "B000IMUYJM", "B0009OUBC4", "B00005U12U", "B00KDU8HQQ", "B005CVFZ66", "B000GIXCL0", "B008CYDD7I", "157362408X", "B008I34YOE", "B003THSXJ6", "B000V6LT5S", "B0001611DI", "B000MV8ABS", "B0002C9DJU", "B00JJOY47I", "B000BB1926", "B00JV054A6", "B000IJ7A5Q", "B00B49GSQQ", "B001MEJY8W", "B000TZJCNW", "B000F3UA8E", "B00125WATQ", "B00FGAKEU0", "B0000694YT", "B003V924Y2", "B000RPCJA2", "B000E41MTU", "B000E8M0P6", "B00023P4SS", "B000V6LT6C", "B00009PY2T", "B0072GPQ8G", "1598830392", "B000067J0M", "B004KDYR1G", "B00GHH9IIA", "B00E5S2HGS", "B00BCMT2BI", "B001LIK8DO", "B00IA1VKVY", "B000T28POM", "B0001XAKUQ", "B0002DB5PO", "B003JFCG82"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0002C9DK4", "B0036R92US", "B0057O6IMS", "B004KDYR20"]}, "price": 19.08, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 91834}, "asin": "6305972052", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51YAWQZAA4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Beyond"}

{"description": "Yasujiro Ozu's economical style reaches its zenith in this deceptively simple 1953 story of an elderly couple in rural Japan who go to visit their married children in Tokyo. Chishu Ryo (Ozu's favorite performer) and Chieko Higashiyama star as the aging parents who find a cold welcome waiting for them from their two urbanized children, too busy with work and their own lives to pay them any attention. After a miserable trip to a noisy spa, the mother spends a pleasant night with the widow of their other son (who had died in the war) while the father drinks the evening away with old friends. But on their return trip, the mother falls ill and the family reunites one last time at her sickbed. Within this simple framework, Ozu creates a quiet but profound drama of the changing face of Japanese culture and the loss of traditional values in modern society. Described by critics as Japan's most \"Japanese\" director, Ozu's style by this time had become firmly established: the entire film is shot from an unmoving camera 36 inches from the floor (the point of view of an observer kneeling on a tatami mat), edited in a subtly off-center manner and paced at a placid tempo. Ozu's graceful style, understated direction, and rich evocation of character creates an elegantly realized world of dignity in the face of disappointment and loss.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302969425"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 552474}, "asin": "B000006D1S", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51QX2HMS9CL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Tokyo Story [VHS]"}

{"description": "Manhunter:Though it will always be remembered as the movie featuring the \"other\" Hannibal Lecter, Michael Mann's 1986 thrillerManhunteris nearly as good asThe Silence of the Lambs, and in some respects it's arguably even better. Based on Thomas Harris's novelRed Dragon, which introduced the world to the nefarious killer Hannibal \"the Cannibal\" Lecter, the film stars William Petersen (giving a suitably brooding performance) as ex-FBI agent Will Graham, who is coaxed out of semiretirement to track down a serial killer who has thwarted the authorities at every turn.Graham's approach to the case is a perilous one. First he seeks counsel with Lecter (Brian Cox) in the latter's high-security prison cell--an encounter that is utterly horrifying in its psychological effect--and then he begins to mold his own psyche to that of the killer, with potentially devastating results. As directed by Mann (who was at the acme of his success with TV'sMiami Vice), this sophisticated cat-and-mouse game never resorts to the compromise of cheap thrills. Predating Anthony Hopkins's portrayal of Lecter by four years, Cox plays the character closer to Harris's original, lower-key conception, and he's no less compelling in the role. Petersen is equally well cast, and as always Mann employs rock music to astonishing effect, using nearly all of Iron Butterfly's heavy-metal epic \"In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida\" to accompany the film's heart-stopping climactic sequence. All of this makesManhunterone of the finest films of its kind, as well as further proof that Harris's fiction is a blessing to any filmmaker brave enough to adapt it. --Jeff ShannonThe Silence of the Lambs: Based on Thomas Harris's novel, this terrifying film by Jonathan Demme really only contains a couple of genuinely shocking moments (one involving an autopsy, the other a prison break). The rest of the film is a splatter-free visual and psychological descent into the hell of madness, redeemed astonishingly by an unlikely connection between a monster and a haunted young woman. Anthony Hopkins is extraordinary as the cannibalistic psychiatrist Dr. Hannibal Lecter, virtually entombed in a subterranean prison for the criminally insane. At the behest of the FBI, agent-in-training Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) approaches Lecter, requesting his insights into the identity and methods of a serial killer named Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine). In exchange, Lecter demands the right to penetrate Starling's most painful memories, creating a bizarre but palpable intimacy that liberates them both under separate but equally horrific circumstances. Demme, a filmmaker with a uniquely populist vision (Melvin and Howard,Something Wild), also spent his early years making pulp for Roger Corman (Caged Heat), and he hasn't forgotten the significance of tone, atmosphere, and the unsettling nature of a crudely effective close-up. Much of the film, in fact, consists of actors staring straight into the camera (usually from Clarice's point of view), making every bridge between one set of eyes to another seem terribly dangerous. --Tom KeoghHannibal: Yes, he's back, and he's still hungry. Ten years afterThe Silence of the Lambs, Dr. Hannibal \"the Cannibal\" Lecter (Anthony Hopkins, reprising his Oscar-winning role) is living the good life in Italy, studying art and sipping espresso. FBI agent Clarice Starling (Julianne Moore, replacing Jodie Foster), on the other hand, hasn't had it so good--an outsider from the start, she's now a quiet, moody loner who doesn't play bureaucratic games and suffers for it. A botched drug raid results in her demotion--and a request from Lecter's only living victim, Mason Verger (Gary Oldman, uncredited), for a little Q and A. Little does Clarice realize that the hideously deformed Verger--who, upon suggestion from Dr. Lecter, peeled off his own face--is using her as bait to lure Dr. Lecter out of hiding, quite certain he'll capture the good doctor.Taking the basic plot contraptions from Thomas Harris's baroque novel,Hannibalis so stylistically different from its predecessor that it forces you to take it on its own terms. Director Ridley Scott gives the film a sleek, almost European look that lets you know that, unlike the first film (which was about the quintessentially American Clarice), this movie is all Hannibal. Does it work? Yes--but only up to a point. Scott adeptly sets up an atmosphere of foreboding, but it's all buildup for anticlimax, as Verger's plot for abducting Hannibal (and feeding him to man-eating wild boars) doesn't really deliver the requisite visceral thrills, and the much-ballyhooed climatic dinner sequence between Clarice, Dr. Lecter, and a third unlucky guest wobbles between parody and horror. Hopkins and Moore are both first-rate, but the film contrives to keep them as far apart as possible, when what madeSilenceso amazing was their interaction. When they do connect it's quite thrilling, but it's unfortunately too little too late. --Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JLKN", "B000NVT0SO", "B000GFLEBI", "B00CWIMVDW", "B000R4SMCW", "B00011CZRE", "B00FYJ6P06", "0425228223", "B000HEWEGC", "B00003CXSP", "B00079Z9WI", "B003W5C0VC", "0312924585", "0440224675", "B0009A40ES", "B002VWNIDG", "B0087ZG7UW", "044024286X", "0783240295", "B000HCO86I", "B000Q66Q8I", "B000U1ZV8K", "B00DTPRZ24", "B002NZK5RI", "B000P0J09M", "B000P0J0AG", "B004SIP95G", "B004LWZW2O", "B005CFBYW6", "B0002JP572", "B000V4UFZK", "B0018CMJSU", "B0052XU4BK", "B008R65XYC", "B000BRBA9C", "B000Q66Q2O", "B00JA3RVG4", "B00005K3NZ", "B00005N5S5", "B002XD0J80", "B0006GANOQ", "B0033B5XCS", "073948253X", "B00AEFYGBA", "B001AS7VQM", "B003HKN52U", "B003XURDAY", "B002VWNIEA", "B000UGBOT0", "B000E8M0P6", "B005CFC0N8", "B00AEBB89W", "B006NXW4EI", "B003PIUIIS", "B00000ILDG", "B004FQX5B6", "B00009W5CA", "B002KH4KSY", "B000RIWAVW", "6305622760", "B002XMGGK6", "B000LP6KNU", "B002YICNE2", "B004LWZW42", "0767830555", "B003UGLCIA", "B000RRS7RE", "B00AEFYYH6", "B002O3Z4ZW", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00006FDCD", "B0002C4JJ4", "B000BBOUW2", "B002GSXKN8", "B00JL6L4UY", "B00441GYZ6", "B003PIUINS", "B000FA57UI", "B00015YVDG", "B0000VCZK2", "B004EPYZO4", "B000P0J0EM", "B00AEBB8NI", "B007D0FVRM", "B00DHD933W", "B007D5E7C2", "B00005V9HH", "B00151QYXU", "B000U1ZV6W", "B006X08FGW", "B00AP2DC94", "B000FS9FCG", "B000FS9FE4", "6305313687", "B0050MB4OO", "B0006HBZXS", "B0009RCPY8", "B00386EZUY", "B003IY498Y", "B0009X768W"], "bought_together": ["B00005JLKN", "B000NVT0SO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005JLKN", "B000NVT0SO", "B000LP6KNU", "B00003CXSP"]}, "price": 23.32, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 51513}, "asin": "B00000G3R0", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51169H5FYEL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Hannibal Lecter Collection (Manhunter / The Silence of the Lambs / Hannibal)"}

{"description": "Although the title means something along the lines of \"no need for  Tenchi,\" everyone wants the hapless hero of this popular series. These  13&nbsp;OAV episodes reunite the cast from the TV show, but with some  changes. Sasami is initially much younger and less domestic; grandfather  Masaki turns out to be Yosho, the long-lost Jurai prince who was betrothed to  Ayeka centuries ago; genius-in-residence Wasshu reveals an unexpected bond  with interstellar outlaw Ryoko. The tone is a little racier than the  broadcast version: Ryoko runs around naked and the attempts to seduce the  terminally klutzy Tenchi are more pointed.In the first adventure (episodes 1-7), Tenchi inadvertently wakes a  mummified demon who was imprisoned at the Masaki family shrine 700&nbsp;years  ago--none other than space pirate extraordinaire Ryoko. The problems she  causes are dwarfed by the arrival of Jurai princesses Ayeka and Sasami,  bubble-brained Galactic Police Agent Miyoshi--and interstellar criminal  Kagato. Assuming the role (and costume) of the Crown Prince of Jurai, Tenchi  defeats the evil Kagato with a magic sword that resembles the lightsabers inStar Wars.Unexpected arrivals keep the Masaki household in chaos in the later,  shorter adventures (episodes&nbsp;8-13), including a baby cousin of Tenchi's, a  shape-shifting robot who impersonates Ryoko, and the Emperor and Empress of Jurai. The writers occasionally lose track of the plot, especially in episode&nbsp;13, \"Here Comes Jurai,\" butTenchihas never been noted for  its logic. In  all the episodes, the filmmakers manage to balance interplanetary threats,  teenage romance, and  broad comedy with their usual aplomb.TheTenchi Encyclopedia(powered by Wasshu OS) offers short biographies  of the main characters with clips and stills, pencil tests, digital comics, Japanese commercials, and full credits for the series.

Without the brooding poutiness it's a homage to Alfred Hitchcock, and it's possible to watch this film just for the parallels or outright hat-tipping that goes on. It's the story of an older, hapless real-estate agent, Vercel (Jean-Louis Trintignant), under suspicion for a ruthless murder.  Since this is a  black-and-white, subtitled French film, the agent's voluptuous, intelligent secretary (a sharp and sexy Fanny Ardant) is hopelessly in love with him. While he hides out in the back office, she tries to get to the bottom of the crime; this is not so much a whodunit as a cinematic treat about the conventions and setups of film noir.

The Baby Einstein folks have a series of tapes (Baby Einstein,Baby Bach) that add visual stimulation to the bouncy recordings (using vibraphone, Rhodes electric piano, and even a glockenspiel). The melodies are heard against colorful imagery of spinning tops, wave machines, soft baby toys, mobiles, and the like. Several parenting groups and magazines have heralded the tapes for children 1 to 36 months, but the Orwellian aspect of introducing babes in arms to the TV screen may cause many to just pick up theCD.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00000INEV", "B00005YUTF", "B00005YUTD", "B00005YUTE", "B00005B21A", "B00006II8F", "B00006SFPA", "B00004WI67", "B000063V8J", "B00009Y3L5", "B00005YUPN", "B00007J88T", "B00005YUPO", "B00005YUPQ", "B0000BWVA4", "B0002MHDSS", "6305071942", "B00006II6R", "1892309165", "B000059Z8Q", "B0006L0L66", "B00024I2VS", "B0002OXUYM", "6304959117", "B000CDGVP8", "B00080ZGCY", "B00005N5UF", "6304959109", "B00006SFM2", "B000BOKB4A", "B00008G8L7", "B000066CAA", "B0007D50XW", "B00008G86X", "0786808047", "B00000I6MF", "B00005LP3P", "B000059HEQ", "B0000DJZC7", "6303005233", "B000EK8HKG", "B001EGOXYI", "B00006JE51", "B00000G3P0", "B00008W2OU", "B000059PSC", "B00005LK90", "1573305707", "B00002AFVK", "189230936X", "B000065VAB", "6305559295", "B00005M2FI", "0792153693", "1571320784", "B000056MOZ", "B0027RMA1Q", "0767833139", "B00005AXAL", "B00004WL4D", "B0000A59Z1", "B00004RFB0", "1571323368", "1892309173", "1892309203", "B00005U8RQ"], "bought_together": ["B00000INEV", "B00005YUTF"], "also_viewed": ["B00005YUPN", "B00000INEV", "B00005YUTD", "B00005YUTF", "B00005YUTE", "B00005YUPQ", "B00005B21A", "B00007J88T", "B00LLPM2DG", "B00006SFM2", "B000059Z8Q", "B00005YUPO", "B0027RMA1Q", "B00004WI67", "B00006SFPA", "B00006II8F", "B000065VCG", "B000063V8J", "B000LSAIZI", "1892309017", "B0000DJZC9", "B00008WFHE", "6305071942", "B004DMS4DQ", "B00006II6R", "B000AAF1UE", "B000066CAA", "B00000I6MF", "B00005YUPP", "B0000BWVA4", "B0000DJZC7", "B000YRY87K", "B00024I2VI", "B0000296Q3", "0788856898", "B00006SFM1", "B001ILFUDW", "B00080ZGCY", "6302642248", "B00003G4IK", "B0000BWVA3", "B0069HEBYY", "B0001IXTU4", "B000063V8I", "B0002MHDSS", "B0002OXUYM", "B00478F2PE", "B00024I2VS", "B0002YBA9O", "B000CDGVP8", "0786851333", "B006C842B2", "B000U1ZV26", "B00009Y3L5", "B000065V7N"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 306895}, "categories": [["CDs & Vinyl", "Children's Music"], ["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.95, "brand": "", "asin": "B00000INEW", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/714K1K78JQL._SY300_.gif", "title": "Baby Mozart [VHS]"}
{"description": "Imagine if an actor's director like Eric Rohmer--whose films consist almost entirely of conversation between pairs or small groups of people--made a film that incorporated elements from movies likeDark City,eXistenZ,The Thirteenth Floor,The Truman Show, andTotal Recall. The result might resemble Alejandro Amenabar's remarkable second feature,Open Your Eyes, which favors ideas over effects and offers twist upon twist with mind-warping agility. This film rewards multiple viewings, pushing the viewer toward one perception of reality, then switching to another until reality itself is called into question. Melodrama, love story, and psychological thriller combine with a dash of science fiction, forming a plot that is both disorienting and deceptively precise.Set in Madrid, the story defies description, but this much can be revealed: young, handsome Cesar (Eduardo Noriega) is vain, rich, charming, and--following a botched suicide-murder scheme by a jilted lover--horribly disfigured. He'd fallen in love with Sofia (Pen&eacute;lope Cruz) but is now an embittered husk of his former self, stuck in a \"psychiatric penitentiary\" on a murder charge and hiding behind an expressionless mask. His reality has crumbled, but as the film's agenda is gradually revealed, we realize that there are other factors in play.

{"description": "Comparisons toThe Blair Witch Projectare inevitable for the inventive, satiricalThe Last Broadcast, a chilling and funny mockumentary by filmmakers Stefan Avalos and Lance Weiler. Besides being made and coming to prominence around the same time (though without aBlair Witch-style marketing juggernaut),The Last Broadcastalso details the doomed travails of some amateur filmmakers as they track a mysterious, murderous legend in a dark forest. Hmmm, sound familiar? Actually,The Last Broadcasttakes a different tack on this premise, one more media-savvy thanBlair Witch. Turns out that this is the latest installment of theX-Files-ish public access showFact or Fiction, and its doofusy hosts (Avalos and Weiler themselves) plan on doing a live broadcast from deep in the New Jersey woods on their ongoing quest for the Bigfoot-like Jersey Devil. Teaming up with two Internet-based fans, they plunge themselves and their equipment into the wintry woods; only one man, the creepy psychic Jim (Jim Seward), returns, and is promptly convicted of the murders of the other three. While it does boast footage made by the \"dead\" filmmakers,The Last Broadcastis more formally structured as a documentary, complete with officious, muckraking host (David Leigh) and much behind-the-scenes footage. We're let in on the backgrounds of the victims, the 911 phone calls, the murder trial, the inconsistencies the prosecution overlooked, and the painstaking work of reconstructing the film stock, which may unlock the mystery of the true killer. Filmed entirely with digital cameras and assembled on digital systems for a mind-boggling $900,The Last Broadcastboasts a great look and a sharp, satiric eye for sending up the media--Avalos and Weiler are in calm command of their medium and message. The film does take a sharp turn that could either enrage or amaze viewers enraptured by what's preceded, but it's a minor quibble at best. And unlikeThe Blair Witch Project,The Last Broadcastdoes answer all the mysterious questions it raises.--Mark Englehart", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 622788}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.96, "brand": "", "asin": "B00001WY85", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51EVVR863XL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Last Broadcast [VHS]"}
{"description": "With a voracious trio of mako sharks wreaking havoc,Deep Blue  Seadares to up the ante onJaws, but director Renny Harlin trades the nuanced suspense of Spielberg's 1975 blockbuster for the trickery of the digital age. In other words, why build genuine terror when you can show ill-fated humans getting torn into bloody chunks? The aforementioned makos have been lab rats in an effort to harvest a miracle cure for Alzheimer's disease from the brains of sharks, but the research has an unfortunate side effect: the sharks get smarter, and they're determined to break out of Aquatica, the deep-sea complex where they've been penned.Model-actress Saffron Burrows plays the researcher; Thomas Jane pulls double-duty as shark expert and action hunk; Samuel&nbsp;L. Jackson's the corporate sponsor who chooses theworsttime for an Aquatica tour; and rapper LL&nbsp;Cool&nbsp;J is nicely cast as Aquatica's cook and comic  relief. Michael Rapaport, Jacqueline McKenzie, and Stellan Skarsg&aring;rd round out the cast, most of whom are turned into shark food as the makos turn Aquatica into a floating junkyard. Harlin takes devilish pleasure in providing sudden, unexpected shocks--no small feat in such a derivative thriller--and  as a series of action set-pieces,Deep Blue Seanever disappoints. It's inevitable that Burrows should end up in her underwear like Sigourney Weaver inAlien, but even then the movie offers a credible reason for the strip-down; thatDeep Blue Seacan be simultaneously ridiculous and sensible is just another one of its shlocky charms.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B008DL4LQ2", "0767802497", "B00008WFU5", "B0006HBZYC", "B00008WFU4", "B00005A8XX", "6305090564", "B004USUP58", "B003VA3JUO", "B000WTVZGC", "B002NZK5U0", "B00AEFYXQI", "6305943133", "B007STBUHI", "B003ZZ7TPG", "0783225547", "B001YYQ9S8", "B00153ZR8G", "B00AIZ2FPK", "B00005O5B5", "B00064X5L6", "B00064AE0G", "B00AEFYSR2", "B000JBXHQY", "B0002V7OI8", "B00E8G5HQE", "B005CHV14A", "B004FHCHAU", "B00018D3UU", "B00DCLTA6Y", "B000BNX3BE", "B003ABZG14", "B003954IV0", "B00BTYNXJG", "B000NVT0TI", "0767817478", "B000N4RAS8", "B000ASATZ8", "B00000IQC4", "B001DSNEK6", "B00000IQVQ", "B00000G3PA", "B004K4FUVQ", "B00008G8M4", "B002O3Z50G", "0783237413", "B00004STDN", "B004XVMCN0", "B002ZG98LO", "0792839684", "B00005UQ9W", "B000PFU83O", "B0010X73ZG", "B00013RC7K", "B00AEFXPMG", "B004LWZW6K", "B00005JOWW", "B00003L9CQ", "B004AC6PV2", "B0002W4SBI", "B000WTVZGW", "B003UN0752", "B0002IQMAM", "B00005JM5B", "B00BNAE14W", "B00AEFXPSK", "B004P7CN7W", "B000X0GWNG", "B00005RYKU", "B00004Z4WR", "0767824954", "B000BUNZY2", "B00008G8LY", "B00317LM8S", "B00111YM56", "B00003CXKA", "B00600SOXE", "B00005JMXX", "B00AEFY6PQ", "B00005JMZK", "6304806434", "B0045HCJ0S", "B00BTYOYG2", "B000AM4P9K", "B004W7D1G2", "B00AEFYV9W", "B002ZG98KK", "B0001FR3IQ", "B00009WVSL", "B0057RCFQS", "B004EPZ08O", "B00003CXO1", "B000CSUNLG", "B003PIUINS", "B001ECDVKE", "B00111YM5Q", "B00IS6WQ5K", "B0021L8UXA", "B00003CXUP"], "bought_together": ["B00008WFU5", "B00008WFU4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0767802497", "B00008WFU4", "B008DL4LQ2", "B00004TDTO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 122500}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.55, "brand": "JACKSON,SAMUEL L.", "asin": "B00002E233", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71TDBGEC1NL._SY300_.gif", "title": "Deep Blue Sea"}
{"description": "Syd (Radha Mitchell) is an editor at a painfully pretentious art  magazine; by chance, she becomes acquainted with lesbian photographer Lucy (Ally Sheedy) and her weirdo German girlfriend (Patricia Clarkson, in a strange Dietrich-like role).  Syd becomes captivated with Lucy and her work and, smelling a career move, offers to feature her in the next issue of the magazine.  The two become attracted, but their relationship is fraught with perils--Syd loses her rather square boyfriend, Lucy's girlfriend takes a hike, the avaricious management at the magazine pressures Syd, and, most importantly, the pair begins to travel down the road of heroin addiction.  Besides the lesbian theme,High Artaddresses such subtexts as what an artist will (or won't) be willing to do for recognition, and what price that recognition carries.High Artis a remarkably honest work, painful at times but understated and thoughtful.  It does an excellent job of portraying the heroin-induced torpor of Lucy and her bohemian friends as they lie around and become consumed with the stuff.  It's a cautionary tale, a sincere love story, a reflection on the nature of art, and a \"lesbian film\" for which the lesbianism is integral but not part of an overriding agenda.  Sheedy is excellent, as is Mitchell in a very expressive role.  It's far from being a feel-good movie, butHigh Artundeniably has some power behind it that will stick with you past the closing credits.--Jerry Renshaw", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B00AFDN5Y0", "B008XAGN46", "B00006RJ97", "B00002CGGH", "B002SF9YTS", "B000SUKPL6", "B000A4T804", "B0001HAGSI", "B00FKPJ3VM", "B004BJMEO6", "B000F7CEBG", "B00827OWO8", "B0085E44W8", "B000J4QWIG", "B00011Y1QC", "B004AYMY92", "B00004U104", "B0038M61IC", "B00005QW5T", "B00004YKR3", "B005Q4CLKW", "B004EI2NM2", "B000F3UA6Q", "B001YXXRZ2", "B001E2PQGG", "B00BDTSLEO", "B0039S3872", "B003OYPOUA", "B0009Q0EMY", "B004AHAEV4", "B000062Y1E", "B00H3RT7M0", "B00005BKZK", "B00GPPXNIK", "B000OVLC0W", "B004N21KIC", "B00004STHG", "B000063K0D", "B00CBG9SQS", "B00005NRNS", "B003L20ICE", "B00EMAGCHE", "B008R6U69Y", "B00006CXI7", "B00C1LIZEE", "B00005OLBC", "B00003CYJ4", "B003YYVSEG", "B0002XNT12", "B00INUK5WM", "0780625528", "B000OY9V8Y", "6302703816", "B001MVWMIY", "B00125WAWI", "B007W6XXAE", "B0000C504K", "B003PCHSVO", "B000HT3P4M", "B0002KPIQY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AFDN5Y0", "B00827OWO8", "B008XAGN46", "B00006RJ97"]}, "price": 19.95, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 627413}, "asin": "B00002JWZT", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/7187XWM9M4L._SY300_.gif", "title": "High Art"}
{"description": "Road Tripis a mostly agreeable, by-the-numbers teen flick with a  handful of inspired sequences, most of them involving MTV's resident disturbed  soul, Tom Green. It concerns a sleepy University of Ithaca student named Josh  (Breckin Meyer) who accidentally mails a video of his sexual encounter with an  infatuation (Amy Smart) to his longtime girlfriend (Rachel Blanchard), who's  seemingly avoiding him while at school in Austin, Texas. Naturally, he recruits  some buddies--Seann William Scott as the lech, D.J. Qualls as the hopeless nerd,  and Paulo Costanzo as the doper genius--to hit the open highway and intercept  the package. Even more naturally, mayhem ensues: A car explodes, a bus is  stolen, a nerd is deflowered, French toast is horribly violated, and an elderly  man bogarts both pot and Viagra.The film's humor is more democratic than politically correct, as everyone--women  and minority characters, not just the hipster white guys--have a hand in the  high jinks. Green plays Barry Manilow (no, not that one), a professional student  (eight years and counting)--he relates the film's story to skeptical prospective  students while leading them on a tour of the college--and thrill-seeking dork  extraordinaire. In particular, in an already justly famous sequence of scenes,  he sadistically anticipates and endeavors to accelerate a mouse's demise at the  jaws of a python. It's very much in the vein ofAmerican Pie, perhaps a  smidgen tamer, but at least its characters don't really learn any dopey lessons  in the end. Director and coscreenwriter Todd Phillips, who earlier made the  much-questioned documentaryFrat House, again proves he's more adept at  staging fictional comic sequences than real ones.--David Kronke", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEFXVW0", "B00AEFYS2M", "B0023TCWE8", "B000069CF0", "B0009ZE9VW", "B00005JMX6", "B00003CXS7", "B000069HQ2", "B000JJ4DNW", "B0009P42WI", "B000IZJZIU", "B003TY2SPO", "B000EMGJAO", "B000BKVQS4", "B001OD4S50", "B00AEFZ3XU", "B002CLKV54", "B00005NTOH", "B005LAIH9A", "B000031WD9", "B002Q4VBPQ", "B000CPH9PM", "B00003CY6D", "B00024JC4E", "B00260HH1W", "B006WXHJLC", "B004SIP8ES", "B00005KA6V", "B0006GANPA", "B000LC3ICE", "B00IMYVCGW", "B003VPX5Y4", "B00AEFYSL8", "B00005JMCT", "B001G5T6GW", "B00003CXE4", "B001J9KJ4I", "B0009HBPN0", "B000WZEZGI", "B00068WOH8", "B00AEBBA2C", "B00005JKMN", "B00000F0AD", "0800141687", "B001L9EXTS", "B00AEFYAMA", "B0026BXHQ0", "B004I9SJH0", "B002FU8IWU", "B0051MKNRC", "B008220BGQ", "B001C0JCBA", "B000BKJ762", "B0000A02TZ", "B004EPYZS0", "B00007AJGM", "B000E6EHE0", "630529142X", "B000RJO56O", "B001DPHDB0", "B00005JL93", "B008R65XUQ", "B0002V7TMY", "B004LWZW5G", "B000BKJ758", "6305310254", "B00005JNZU", "B004EPZ06G", "B004EPZ084", "B0041KKYGU", "0783235070", "B000ELJAEM", "B000FP2OPO", "B00003CXO1", "B004SIP9CO", "B00441GZ1E", "B00003CXPS", "B000FS9UKI", "B000F9RLL2", "B002AS466O", "B00005JMDZ", "6305428549", "B00003CY5A", "6305433925", "B0001XAQ9Q", "B000063RQO", "B00049QJBG", "B003Y5H5B0", "B00081912E", "B002ZG99H2", "B00BTYNXJG", "B0006HBZE2", "B00441GYVA", "B00005JLQE", "B00AEFY0XE", "B00KNALRZ4", "0790730979", "B008R65XNS", "B008JFUORW", "B001KKU9DW"], "bought_together": ["B00AEFXVW0", "B000JJ4DNW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AEFXVW0", "B00AEFYS2M", "B000CPH9PM", "B004GTVU6O"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 59003}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.69, "brand": "Dreamworks Skg", "asin": "B00003CXIY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5142ge7XncL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Road Trip (Unrated Edition)"}

{"description": "The Replacementsmanages to be both completely formulaic and yet immensely enjoyable. When a professional football players' strike happens, the owner of a fictitious team, the Washington Sentinels, commissions maverick coach Jimmy McGinty (Gene Hackman) to pull together a team. McGinty selects a collection of talented oddballs--a Welsh soccer player, a sumo wrestler, a couple of professional bodyguards--with athletic pasts, figuring that if it doesn't work out as a game, it might as well be a circus. To lead the team, he finds Shane Falco (Keanu Reeves), a once-promising player who had a disastrous championship game. Naturally, despite squabbling and bickering, a roguish camaraderie develops through a mixture of racial infighting, harassment from the striking professionals, and a big bar brawl--after which they're all thrown in jail and perform the most improbable impromptu dance number ever committed to film. The mixture of cheerfully clich&eacute; plot mechanics, an engaging collection of supporting actors (including Orlando Jones, Rhys Ifans fromNotting Hill, and Jon Favreau fromSwingers), and sheer ridiculousness somehow combines to makeThe Replacementscompletely entertaining. Reeves is somehow turning into a pleasant leading man; he even emotes convincingly in this movie. And let's face it, Gene Hackman is quite possibly the greatest actor alive, able to speak the trashiest dialogue with fierce conviction. Plus, just to prove that the tight pants and close huddles of football are heterosexual, there are many, many shots of cheerleaders going through stripper-inspired routines.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00E1HIXFW", "B002NZK5QO", "6305428492", "B000J3OTT6", "B000056VP4", "B00AEFYJI0", "B00AEFYKWU", "B000FOPPDI", "B000NTMA0Q", "B0006GANOQ", "B000F6ZIIS", "B00005JPBO", "B00AEBB9UU", "B00005JNEW", "B000A0GP0Y", "B00005JKE4", "B00E8G5HZ0", "B000KHYN9C", "0792843592", "B001SGEUYW", "B00004W221", "B00AEFXJY0", "B002GIBVWA", "B000FVR1T2", "B001Q8MMBK", "B002VECM6S", "0780627849", "B00BTYNXJG", "B0009MDPYM", "630529142X", "B00005QW6W", "B00003CXND", "B004OBQDHK", "B004KPLVX6", "B002K0WBXW", "B000HEWEE4", "B00014NEZI", "B00005M20J", "0800177258", "B001BP4K22", "0767802454", "6305428530", "B004GJYRF0", "B00005JL93", "B000053VAX", "B00000F4ZY", "B000CCBCAI", "B0000B1OFL", "B00026ZD04", "6304712499", "6305428077", "B00000G3PA", "B000GAKDAG", "0767817710", "B00DW5IL92", "B002U4UYYQ", "6304711891", "B000U1ZV8A", "B00008L3W3", "6305213283", "0783228465", "B003AWRMBA", "B00FEHCQEC", "B008R65XTC", "B004BFTFBU", "B0047685IC", "0767817729", "B000QUCRB4", "B0026BXHPG", "B00000JGPE", "6305428387", "B0007DAGZ4", "B004KPLVWM", "6305428115", "B00AEBB86A", "6304806434", "6305262128", "078324021X", "B0000524E5", "6305065551", "B0006GAI5U", "B0001US66Y", "0767821513", "B0009X76ZK", "B000EXZFCQ", "B002GOAH1A", "B00AEFYDM2", "B00007E2F5", "B000A343RI", "B00AEFYIH2", "6305133468", "B00AEBB86U", "0783225741", "B000069HQ2", "B00005A3KS", "B002AT8KD8", "B000YGGNMO", "B007STBUHI", "B000089778", "B000ELJAEM"], "bought_together": ["B00E1HIXFW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00B83N2NU", "B000MNOX94", "B00005JKE4", "0790749912"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 62076}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.99, "brand": "Team Marketing", "asin": "B00003CXLV", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/513B1VE3PSL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Replacements (Snap Case)"}
{"description": "Many Hollywood directors should follow Rod Lurie's lead and invite their stars to do the DVD commentary. Oscar nominee Joan Allan joins Lurie, turning the commentary track into an enjoyable conversation. It tends to be a lovefest at times but does give insight into the relationship between a lead actor and director during filmmaking. Over the end credits, Lurie mentions the brouhaha that actor (and producer) Gary Oldman started when he made discouraging comments about the film's final cut. It's interesting to note none of Oldman's work ends up in the dozen deleted scenes shown on the DVD. The scenes have much more meat on the bone than most and illustrate some curious character development. The half-hour making-of featurette has the standard press-kit materials but also gives us a good background on the history of political thrillers.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783227973", "B0060ZJ7DA", "0780622561", "B001ECDVK4", "B0043X1FNQ", "B000CEXEWA", "B004IFYMWK", "B00AEFYTMQ", "B00003CWRX", "6304696507", "B00AEFYUQQ", "6305297142", "B003ASLJIQ", "B00005JNP4", "B0001V6ZJI", "B001ECDVJU", "B0059XTTW8", "0783116934", "B0013XZ2QK", "B000067IZ3", "B00005BCK9", "B00000K3TU", "0792159659", "B00005UM2X", "B000C65Z1G", "B00441GYTC", "6305428522", "B00003CXQG", "630542828X", "B002NZK5UU", "6305310335", "B00000IQC0", "B002EAYE42", "B00005OOQ2", "B002ZG993Q", "B004SIP6C2", "B005FITIGO", "B0043X1FKY", "B00004RF83", "0767802519", "B00006ZXSN", "0783229402", "B006ML50QK", "B00003CXPV", "0800141806", "B00DW5IK9S", "B000BYRCQU", "B00006L92U", "B000CQLZ8S", "B00008K76V", "B00AEBB8LA", "B000Y11B8U", "0767803434", "B007KAUWO2", "6304696515", "B003Y5H4R0", "B0000542C5", "B0011V7PSC", "B00GUO2SKA", "B00G7QQ3AC", "0790730979", "B00AEFXUXU", "B001PR0Y8K", "B00000K3CS", "B00015YVDG", "1558908382", "B00AEFXYJA", "B00008K76U", "B002DU39GW", "0792845811", "B004SIP7F8", "B000056HEA", "B0039UT3LK", "B0007IO6NM", "B00JA3RVG4", "B00G7QPXUI", "B00004XPPB", "B00005BCKF", "0764585533", "B00GMV8M2Y", "B0000SXK0E", "B000063US3", "B004FQX59I", "B00008K7AO", "B00AEFYIH2", "B00003CXFV", "B001GLX6UI", "B00006RCNY", "B0045HCJJ4", "B00BTYRB58", "6305428115", "B001AMHNKW", "B0012EBV6A", "0767811100", "B0060ZJ7AI", "B0009GX1CE", "B000HT38IK", "B00004ZBVO", "B00005ATZT"], "bought_together": ["0783227973", "0780622561"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0064470393", "0783227973"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 40208}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 13.99, "brand": "", "asin": "B00003CXP7", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/411PCH1X0RL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Contender"}
{"description": "Men of Honorpresents a great role model for younger viewers, yet it's rated R due to abundant use of theFword. With appropriate discretion, parents should allow their preteen and teenaged children to see this rousing if altogether conventional biopic inspired by the life of Carl Brashear. Played with gravity and gumption by Cuba Gooding Jr., Brashear was the first African American to become a master diver in the U.S. Navy, despite the lingering effects of segregation, opposition from Navy brass, and the amputation of his left leg following a tragic on-duty accident. Robert De Niro adds marquee value and salty bluster as Billy Sunday, the drunken, redneck (and fictionalized) Master Chief who watches, with gradual admiration, as Brashear attains his ultimate goal through sheer force of will.This is all quite uplifting on its surface, but in attempting to hit the requisite highlights of an inspiring biography, director George Tillman Jr. (Soul Food) reduces Brashear's achievement to a succession of clich&eacute;s, forcing Gooding and De Niro to battle sentiment with their noteworthy performances. As Sunday's neglected wife, Charlize Theron is completely extraneous; Hal Holbrook's diving-school commander is a ranting caricature; and newcomer Aunjanue Ellis barely registers as Brashear's wife (in part because their obligatory romance is handled with an utter lack of finesse). There's no question that Brashear's efforts are heroic and worthy of recognition, soMen of Honorserves its basic purpose. Still, one can't help but wonder if Brashear's story would be even more impressive with a more authentic treatment.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000KF0GWW", "B00005B6JZ", "B000F6IODE", "B00005JLRZ", "B00003CXGV", "6304765258", "1558908315", "B0007KIFGE", "B00319ECI8", "B00005JA9F", "B00125WAWS", "B0006L0L5C", "B000P0J0C4", "B000056VP4", "0790736411", "B000065U1N", "B005LAIGN2", "B00AEFYRP0", "B002NZK5VO", "B003ASLJOU", "B0002WZTOI", "B00005JPBO", "0790732238", "6305432317", "B00003CXHJ", "B00005N5S3", "B002VWNICM", "B002AT8K9W", "B002VECM6S", "B00067BCBI", "B00008EY60", "B00000G3PA", "B005LAIGYQ", "B00005JKTP", "B002D755AI", "B000095WW8", "B00AEFY5B6", "B0045HCJHQ", "B00AEFXOKO", "B00AEBB9NM", "B00003CXTG", "B000P0J0EM", "B00008K76U", "B00AEBBA36", "B00005JK8K", "B000KGGIZK", "0800177967", "B00026ZD04", "B000EXZFCQ", "B00003CXFV", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00004XPPG", "B004SIP7ZS", "0792159659", "B000E8QVWY", "B00005PJ8L", "B00AEFYENK", "B00005JLSB", "B00008L3S6", "B000P0J0CE", "B00001ZWUS", "B000P0J09C", "B0006GAOJA", "0451409744", "6304711891", "B00AEFYUQQ", "B00E8G5HZ0", "B002GHHHPQ", "B00441GZ1Y", "B000JYW5BE", "B00005Y1UX", "B001FB55L2", "0790730979", "0783226845", "0783240295", "B00004W221", "0783225733", "B00005JKWX", "B00G4Q3KOC", "B0045HCJ8K", "B00HLTD3ZW", "6305213305", "B00AEFXT1S", "B000SFOW8I", "B000EHSVSC", "B0006IIOHC", "B001QERPAC", "B000P0J0EW", "B004AOECXI", "0780631684", "B00HZMZ2FE", "B00096S49Y", "B0000542CK", "B000066HAS", "B000A2UBN4", "B0043X1FL8", "B00005JNQA", "B000059TFO", "B00003CXTM"], "bought_together": ["B000KF0GWW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00003CXRP", "B005LAIHXQ", "B00DV2MVWO", "B000KF0GWW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 125288}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.99, "brand": "TCFHE", "asin": "B00003CXPP", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516WESMCF3L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Men of Honor"}

Not far behind, however, is a young vampire hunter (Miller) from London, determined to save a young woman (Justine Waddell) with whom Dracula shares his dark legacy!", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000GIXEIG", "B00008DDUZ", "B00007AJF4", "B0009PBLU4", "B000WP07F6", "B0007US7D0", "B00027NVXE", "B000G8P1Y6", "B000TGJ80S", "B000V8VNUM", "B00AEFYGBA", "B004R6VHQY", "B00AEBB8QK", "B002SG7Z7A", "B000069I1I", "B001D7WF98", "B002ZG998G", "B005FITIDC", "B001M4YZ90", "B00A2H9UG6", "6305258287", "B0007TKNII", "B0059XTUR2", "B00006JDVV", "B001APZMJS", "B003HKN52U", "B00009XN4C", "B002P413IC", "B000OY9V8Y", "B002XMGGK6", "B004XYOQU4", "6305047456", "0767811097", "B003Y5H5FG", "B0009YA3OA", "B00HEPDGKA", "B000YAA68C", "B00E8G5HXM", "B000QXDED6", "B00IKM5LXG", "B0002KVUKM", "B00AAQHP66", "B004P7CN3G", "6305505519", "B00005JM5B", "B000056HPB", "B000OCY7TY", "B001GCUO0W", "B0000VAFO0", "B00J4LMHMK", "B002AK9UPO", "0767807588", "B0002KVULG", "B00946G2YE", "B005LAIH2C", "B00AEFY6PQ", "B001ASIHZG", "B000654YIS", "B00BEIYHO2", "B003AWRMC4", "B003VE9WP6", "B0001GF2D8", "B004P7CN7W", "B005CFBZWK", "B00AEBBA72", "B005LAIHYU", "B00006FD9N", "B002ZG98N2", "B002USF1WC", "B00CBK6506", "B00003CWRF", "B0018O4YT0", "B0002J4X1Q", "B003HDYOTU", "B003F30YYG", "B0009MDPYM", "B0085A9HU6", "6304602944", "B00003CY6P", "B002ZG97CO", "B000MX7V70", "B0009P42WI", "B008JFUS0U", "B004P7CMOQ", "B000AOEQ4W", "B0045HCJT4", "B000C0Z93G", "B009MO57H6", "B00AEFXPMG", "6305065551", "B000F6IOC0", "B00HQOFAKI", "B00B2BYY3U", "B000654YWY", "B002436WG2", "B002ZG98UA", "B00006JDU8", "B00008K76W", "B001TK80C0"], "bought_together": ["B0007TKNII"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005CFBZWK", "B005GRF318", "B002XMGGK6", "B000QXDED6"]}, "price": 17.5, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 96150}, "asin": "B00003CXSD", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51BJ6V44TGL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Dracula 2000"}
{"description": "To callPearl Harbora throwback to old-time war movies is something of an understatement. Director Michael Bay's epic take on the bombing that brought the United States into World War II hijacks every war movie situation and clich&#xE9; (some affectionate, some stale) you've ever seen and gives them a shiny, glossy spin until the whole movie practically gleams. Planes glisten, water sparkles, trees beckon--and Bay's re-creation of the bombing itself, a 30-minute sequence that's tightly choreographed and amazingly photographed, sets the action movie bar up quite a few notches. And in updating the classic war film, Bay and screenwriter Randall Wallace (Braveheart) use that old plot standby, the love triangle--this time, it's between two pilots (Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett) and a nurse (Kate Beckinsale) who find themselves stationed at Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, during what they thought would be a nice, sunny tour of duty. Then, of course, history intervened.For the first 90 minutes of the movie, Affleck and Beckinsale find a nice, appealing chemistry that plays on his strengths as a movie star and hers as a serious actress--he gives her glamour, she gives him smarts. Their truncated romance--the beginning of which is told in flashback so we can get right to the point where he has to leave her to go to England--works, thanks to their charm. They're no Kate and Leo fromTitanic(a strategy the film strives hard toward), but they're pretty darn adorable in their own right. Hartnett, as the not entirely unwelcome third wheel, squints bravely but makes only a slight dent in the film. Everyone else inPearl Harbor--from Cuba Gooding Jr.'s brave navy seaman to Jon Voight's able impersonation of FDR--is pretty much a glorified walk-on, taking a backseat to the pyrotechnics and action sequences that keep the three-hour film in fairly constant motion. But when that action does take hold,Pearl Harboris quite a thrilling ride.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792151712", "B000059HGY", "B00000K3AN", "B00AEBBA36", "0792133153", "079212569X", "6305169187", "6301734734", "0792147618", "0792116887", "6304618344", "079213690X", "6303269834", "6304925131", "6305718792", "6304259131", "B00004WIDB", "6304935811", "6303057225", "6304143184", "6302250269"], "bought_together": ["B00000K3AN", "B00AEBBA36"], "also_viewed": ["B00000G3PA", "0792151712", "6300213668", "B00000JS61", "6303215734", "6303402348", "B00004WIDB", "079213690X", "6305750750", "B004751DFU", "B00005O893", "B00000K3AN", "6301792734", "B00E5I2MCM", "6305169187", "B00007LVCM", "B007SPPANM", "B00L4K3MLE", "B00FLML7HW", "B008QZ5PY2", "B00JBGWP3Y"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 234413}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.49, "brand": "", "asin": "B00003CXTF", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HC1ZDJN6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]"}

The \"True Patriots\" featurette is much better, examining the painstaking efforts toward authenticity in production design, artillery, and costuming. The visual effects featurette offers a study of several pivotal shots, displayed in triptych fashion (to show how effects are layered together from separate elements) and narrated by visual effects supervisor Stuart Robertson. Generous photo galleries are included, featuring shots of the primary cast, sets, and costumes (the last matched by a gallery of conceptual drawings), and the feature-length commentary by director Roland Emmerich and producer Dean Devlin is worthwhile, if not altogether essential.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEFXKUI", "B00AMSLDTM", "B00AEBBA36", "B00AEFY5B6", "B00001ZWUS", "0800177967", "B000A2WP7O", "B00008G8M4", "B00003CXTG", "B004AOECXI", "B002O3Z510", "B000065U1N", "B00005221M", "B00000G3PA", "B00AEFY0F2", "B000E5N6LG", "B002O3Z50Q", "B0001HLVS2", "079284646X", "B00003CXA6", "B008MIMWOY", "6304711905", "0783225733", "B002VWNID6", "B0002WZTOI", "B000P0J0EW", "B00009OOFA", "B000NOKFHQ", "0783231202", "B000P0J0EM", "B003U0AHBO", "B004SIP7TE", "B00003CXQA", "B0000TANUI", "0792839137", "B00011CZRE", "B00005B6JZ", "B0002DRDBY", "B00AEFXRRO", "B002AS464Q", "B000WGWQG8", "B00026L9CU", "B00005JN5E", "B00007GZYC", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00005ATZT", "B000067D1R", "B000U1ZV8K", "B00B0U2SFE", "B003AWRMCE", "6304806434", "B00AEBB932", "B00005JM6F", "B00005JL3T", "B002ZG997C", "B00AEFXVCU", "B000FI8MPW", "B000VKL6ZM", "B00319ECI8", "B005LAIGYQ", "B0045HCJT4", "B0008JIJ2O", "B002O3Z50G", "B00AZNEW5G", "B00008AOTO", "B000LP6KNU", "0783227973", "B002VWNIBI", "B004FQX5B6", "B00AEBB9WI", "B004IK30M8", "B004IK30MI", "B0007PALM0", "B00AEBBA0E", "B001TK80D4", "B000O77SRC", "B004SIP7ZS", "B000095WW8", "079283366X", "6305558167", "B00AEFXKOO", "B0007TKNM4", "B0002YLCG0", "B00003CXHJ", "B000MZHW40", "B000F48D4G", "B001BNFRB2", "B00AEFXYJA", "B000QXDED6", "0767817710", "B0004Z33EG", "B00005JN0W", "B003ASLJRC", "B00HEPE6MM", "0790729695", "B000FVQLRA", "B00004WG2F", "B008MIMWQW", "B000GG4Y32", "B0068FZ0O2"], "bought_together": ["B00001ZWUS", "B00AEBBA36"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00001ZWUS", "B00AEFY5B6", "B004AOECXI", "B000NOKFHQ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 2823}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.0, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B00004XPPG", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51NDFXHAW9L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Patriot (Special Edition)"}

{"description": "One of the overlooked films of the 1980s, perhaps because it is such a downbeat tale of an amoral family. Sean Penn plays a kid whose small-time criminal impulses are stoked to a new level when he falls in with his father (Christopher Walken), a vicious career criminal for whom no problem is so large that it can't be solved by a murder. At first exhilarated by the attention from his father (and the jobs he gives him to do), he gradually catches on to just what a bad guy Dad really is. But when he tries to extricate himself, he discovers that Dad now has him squarely in his sights. Penn is terrific in a role of emotional complexity, while Walken, king of the creeps, is positively frightening as this soft-spoken but highly lethal patriarch.--Marshall Fine", "related": {"bought_together": ["B00005NKV6"], "also_viewed": ["6304297564"]}, "price": 22.75, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 603965}, "asin": "B00004Y871", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41RXW7R5RAL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "At Close Range [VHS]"}
{"description": "There are hundreds of thousands of companies in modern Tokyo, but only one Phantom Quest Corporation, a firm that specializes in exorcisms and troublesome spirits. Its founder and CEO is Ayaka Kisaragi, a red-haired klutz whose lipstick turns into an enchanted sword when she needs to dispatch vampires, demons, or ghosts. She's assisted by the exorcist Rokkon, the medium Madame Suimei, the innocent-looking Nanami, and Mamoru, a long-suffering computer whiz who tries to reconcile Ayaka's profligate spending with her limited income. The tone ofPhantom QuestsuggestsGhostbustersremade for Bette Midler--Ayaka drinks too much, oversleeps, and murders songs in karaoke settings, but she comes through in the end. Her tongue-in-cheek adventures juxtapose supernatural villains with slapstick comedy, much of it involving her put-upon beau, Detective Karino. In \"Kiss of Fire,\" they defeat Count Dracula (whose coffin has been purchased as a novelty by a Japanese businessman) but trash Tokyo Tower in the process. The most satisfying of the four adventures is \"Love Me Tender,\" in which the ghost of an archeologist tries to protect his former fianc&eacute;e from beyond the grave. Possible sequels are hinted at in the DVD extras. Rated 13 and up for nudity, violence, sexual situations, and occasional profanity.--Charles Solomon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000056MWR", "B00C3JUKJC", "B00005B1VN", "B000087F31", "B00004Y9PV", "B008NNY9HQ", "B00008G6U3", "B00004YS8F", "B0007939U2", "B00HXEWFUY", "B00GS1JRPY", "B00CJ7Y0US", "B0088FS1F0", "B00F9F975A", "B005HVWVU4", "B008UQUSFI", "B00I4F0HTW", "B00CU6WBFE", "B00C3JUH22", "B002FOQXSM", "B00DICPBP6", "B00009MGER", "B00BBMKB32", "B0002JELRM", "B00015HUVG", "B000E5LF0K", "6305858357", "B005HVWVJK", "B004STBFBM", "B0085A9JGI", "B005NQ5LM8", "B005W2BWSA", "B0029KS9G6", "B007V9ECWU", "B0000296QB", "B008XEZXYI", "B001GTFP18", "B000FILUL0", "B00004YZGB", "B000059TP7", "B000095J2L", "B003NE8B4M", "B00CBDG50S", "B0001LYESW", "B00CDV4R26", "B00AUJH39M", "B005S0STWS", "B000031EG6", "B00005ALLU", "B00DPH7RBU", "B0001DCXQA", "B00CU6WB5Y", "6305419639", "B00005LP44", "B001808CVK", "B000NIBUXU", "B00006CY49", "B00843TZEC", "B001J0FVWW", "B0002I83S6", "B00005LP45", "B00006FD8W", "B006MWA92E", "B009RG4LBM", "B009AVC9BI", "B007V2LND8", "B008NNY9MQ", "B00004T3BS", "B0006IIPNA", "B0001DCXSI", "B00BKBCLBY", "B00AO05ACE", "B003VQO538", "B00HFCAEAW", "B00CU6WBOU", "B0000APVFZ", "B002BWD764", "B000UP87ZA", "B004FHCHA0", "B00DSAUK9U", "B00EZ228FE", "B000056KN0", "1578004306", "B00ENNO1E6", "B00CU6WBMW", "B00B6DTEX4", "B00114UUMW", "B005W2BW5S", "B005HVWWD0", "B00BQ1DDUG", "B0017LGQJU", "B001F2U700", "B00DHS8MUM", "B0002S65PE", "B005W2BW44", "B0084DVVTE", "B00009B8D4", "B0000APVFL", "B00440OG2A", "B0029KS9GG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001GTFP18", "B000056MWR", "B0000296QB", "B0007CNXYQ"]}, "price": 8.29, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 197686}, "asin": "B00004Y9PW", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RE401N7TL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Phantom Quest Corp - Perfect Collection"}

{"description": "\"I'm gonna scare the hell out of you,\" intones Stephen King in the trailer for his sole directorial effort, the much-malignedMaximum Overdrive. While the end result doesn't live up to that boast, this sci-fi/horror tale isn't as awful as it's been described. King's script (based on his short story \"Trucks\") focuses on the patrons of a North Carolina truck stop, which comes under attack by a convoy of trucks and other machines animated by Earth's passage through the tail of a \"rogue comet.\" King's fans, tired of half-baked screen adaptations likeCujoandChildren of the Corn, expected a horror home run fromMaximum Overdriveand instead got an old-fashioned drive-in movie filled with car crashes, cheapjack gore, and fart jokes. Needless to say, they stayed away in droves; the film's failure helped ruin producer Dino De Laurentiis's DEG Films and forced King to sheepishly claim that he had created a modern-dayPlan Nine from Outer Space. While the film is torpidly paced and often amateurishly acted, it's no worse than any direct-to-video thriller, and King's ear for dialogue occasionally shines through the gloom. Emilio Estevez and Pat Hingle register as a heroic cook and his black-hearted boss, respectively; the cast includes Yeardley Smith (Lisa Simpson's voice), Giancarlo Esposito, and Marla Maples (!) as a victim. Anchor Bay's letterboxed print is the R-rated theatrical version; the film was cut extensively after receiving an X rating for violence. The original trailer and a thorough biography on King are also included.--Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305120021", "B0002O7XW2", "B000G1R39E", "B0013527K2", "6305645574", "B00006FDCU", "B0030BOCL4", "B0001FVDQ4", "B006J8NPAE", "B00A1AU72A", "B00006FDCD", "B0002A2VK0", "B0007WFXNA", "B000053UIF", "B00005UQ9V", "6304936397", "B0000C2IQQ", "B000068IES", "B00AEBB91E", "B00BW4S87U", "B000063UR5", "1573625779", "B00JF5GAIW", "0792841328", "B000AYELI8", "B000U1ZV6W", "B00009OWI3", "B0010X73ZG", "B00AEBB91O", "1573626910", "B00005LQ0Q", "B00BTYPW7C", "0767821599", "B005CFBZVG", "B001DZOC64", "0783228686", "B0053TWVDC", "B00BW4S8AC", "B00AEFYV9W", "1573623911", "B00000F3SB", "B0052XU4BK", "0790742829", "B0053TWW9K", "B000063JDM", "B002KH4KSY", "B002NZK5SM", "B000GYI340", "B00AEFY37C", "B002WDR4AC", "B000063US5", "B0053TWV46", "B003L2M584", "B0007NFMB2", "B0002OXVG4", "B000069I05", "B00AEFXR8I", "B00AKGG828", "B00KW3A6KE", "B00005RDAI", "630523650X", "0792842960", "B008A1TUW0", "B002GHHHH4", "B0052SO0LK", "6304604572", "B0053TWVA0", "B00KDU8HQQ", "B0084MVE7E", "B000MDFTHE", "B00005K3NR", "B00008WT5J", "B00APQLJTA", "6305756430", "B00006CXGP", "6305238065", "B00AEFXPG2", "B000H4JH7Q", "B002GHHHG0", "B006BZ8NSE", "B0002V7O3I", "B004AC6PMG", "B002WJHBE0", "157362408X", "B005OK0YVG", "B0033HKCV4", "B008DL4KZY", "B00005N5RM", "B00BW4S89S", "B00006RCOC", "B003VA3JUO", "B005LS4MQY", "B00AEFY31S", "B005DL6PLY", "B00005O439", "B00JVQ7PWU", "B00GJNQ4M0", "B00009PY4C"], "bought_together": ["B0002O7XW2", "B0013527K2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002WDR4AC", "6305120021", "B0002O7XW2", "B00A1AU72A"]}, "price": 79.0, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 111118}, "asin": "B0000509C5", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51M1301NVNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Maximum Overdrive"}
{"description": "Buffy Summers (Sarah Michelle Gellar) looks like your typical perky high-schooler, and like most, she has her secret fears and anxieties. However, while most teens are worrying about their next date, their next zit, or their next term paper, Buffy's angsting over the next vampire she has to slay. See, Buffy, a young woman with superhuman strength, is the \"chosen one,\" and she must help rid the world of evil, namely by staking demons. The exceptional first season ofBuffy the Vampire Slayerintroduces us to the treacherous world of Sunnydale High School (where Buffy moved after torching her previous high school's gym). The characters there include \"watcher\" Giles (Anthony Stewart Head) and the original \"Scooby Gang\" members--friendly geek Xander (Nicholas Brendon), computer whiz Willow (Alyson Hannigan), and snobbish popular girl Cordelia (Charisma Carpenter)--who aid Buffy in her quest. Those used to the darker tone thatBuffytook in its later seasons will be surprised by the lighter feeling these first 12 episodes have--it's kind of likeBuffy 90210as the cast grapples with regular teen problems in addition to saving the world from demonic darkness. Fans of the show will enjoy the crisp writing, the phenomenal chemistry of the cast (already well-established within the first few episodes), and the introduction to characters that would stay for many seasons, including moody vampire Angel (David Boreanaz). Through it all, Gellar carries the series with amazing confidence, whether conveying the despair of high school or dispatching various demons--she's one of TV's most distinctive and strongest heroines.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000EHSVL4", "B000EHSVLE", "B000EHSVLY", "B000EHSVM8", "B000EHSVN2", "B000EHSVMS", "B000I0QLQY", "B000I0QLR8", "B000I0QLRI", "B000I0QLRS", "B000I0QLS2", "B0006IUE16", "B000HD1482", "B0009W5J4Q", "B007H9CNOI", "B000B5XOW0", "B003YF9Q08", "B000CCBCGM", "B005CM1IIE", "B000ERVJM2", "B000GG4Y6O", "B000OIOPHC", "1593078226", "B00344EAQO", "B0046XG48O", "B00133QNRW", "B00001R3O1", "B000JLTRIG", "B00466H3CW", "B00006J3WH", "1442412097", "B0000AQS0F", "1595821651", "B002JVWR9U", "B000BOH986", "B000QDLSR0", "B00133QNS6", "B002U8XW9Q", "0789326302", "B00JF5GAZA", "B000FP2OPY", "B00A8KJN8M", "067103541X", "B000FL7CAK", "B00JF5G8WU", "B0024FAR66", "B003IMERF6", "0671042599", "B000W089VU", "B000BW7QWW", "B004SIP9P6", "B009LDCXNY", "B006LG74Q0", "B0001JXPPC", "B00006FD9N", "159307784X", "B002JVWR4A", "159307963X", "B000P0I4P8", "B000BOH98G", "B001M5UDGS", "B002JVWR4U", "B000GG4Y28", "B000RO6JYK", "B00133QNSG", "B000KLQUMG", "0671024337", "B000HT3P60", "B008X6N8KW", "B00005V6BG", "B000NA2BEU", "B000R9YLKY", "B000RW3VDE", "B0058YPGL6", "B000CNE0SS", "B005GP7ELM", "B003L77GH4", "B000AJJNFE", "B0001GF2F6", "B000A5045Q", "B009LDCWWG", "1595825584", "B000LC4ZIA", "B000G1R4RK", "B002BAW6HW", "B00HEQOAIQ", "B001992NWO", "B000X5SPBI", "B000GBEWSO", "B000R7I44K", "B002JVWR54", "B001ILFUA0", "B003L77GAQ", "B00005JLKB", "B000N6TYLW", "B001L1S1OY", "B000EWBNMS", "B00018D42W", "B0043CT976", "B00BBXSPES"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0046XG48O", "B000EHSVLY", "B000EHSVL4", "B000EHSVLE"]}, "price": 1.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 129374}, "asin": "B00005221I", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DJ570H6VL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Buffy The Vampire Slayer - The Complete First Season"}
{"description": "Bird The year: 1946. The event: Oakland's \"Jazz at the Philharmonic.\" The music streaked into the unknown, daring listeners to grab hold and fly there, too. On stage was the creator of those new sounds: Charles \"Yardbird\" Parker. In the crowd was the 16-year-old who would someday bring Parker's extraordinary story to the screen: Clint Eastwood. \"Americans don't have any original art except Western movies and jazz,\" observes Eastwood. Movie fans, of course, know that few heroes sit as tall in the saddles as Eastwood. Now the legendary America icon, whose Dirty Harry films have been praised for their jazz scores, ventures deeper into that other original American art. Eastwood produces and directs Bird, a film burnished with the magic of that 1946 concert encounter between legend and future legend and honored with an Academy Award for Best Sound in its spellbinding recreation of a man and his music. Like jazz itself, Bird rings with counterpoints and embellishments. Past and future overlap as the film explores Yardbird's soaring skill and destructive excesses. Forest Walker (Good Morning Vietnam, The Color of Money), in his Cannes Film Festival Best Actor performance, is a candle ablaze at both ends as Parker. Diane Venora (Wolfen, Ironweed, F/X) shares that glorious light, winning the New York Film Critics Circle Best Supporting Actress Award for her portrayal of steadfast wife Chan Parker. For Bird's wall-to-wall-to-everywhere digitally-processed Surround Stereo soundtrack, Eastwood went to the source: Parker's recordings (including cuts never before released). Backgrounds were electronically eliminated. These parker \"solos\" were then rerecorded with accompaniment by modern musicians attuned to Yardbird's bold improvisations. It's \"like Bird was in the studio,\" says music supervisor Lennie Niehaus. He's elsewhere, too. That's why jazz buffs and now film fans have a saying 'Bird liv", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0016OM3TU", "B000BVNS7U", "B00007CVRL", "B000053VC9", "B0006Q9482", "B0000549B2", "B000TNJIK6", "B003AWRMCY", "B00AEFYG3S", "B0001FVDK0", "B0002M5T5M", "B003AWRMBU", "B00009N83V", "B003AWRMC4", "B00005M2CK", "B002TVQ4D0", "B003AWRM9W", "B003ASLJKE", "B0034G4OXQ", "B00005Y71L", "B000NIVJF4", "B00EDR5MTK", "B0012K53U4", "B0000DZ3HM", "B00005IA7Y", "B00KE3B97Q", "B000BITUEI", "B004YCKJGU", "B003AWRM9M", "B001M9ELQ2", "B006OFN0SE", "0792845838", "0062005596", "B00000470T", "B0000026KK", "B00003OSU4", "B001NFNFNU", "B003ASLJQS", "B000BBOUHM", "B00K2OBTRC", "B0012GN1CU", "B003HKN534", "B000ELFO9M", "B00AEFXVOI", "B0000046WK", "B001CW2HJC", "B00KIZY3XW", "B003ASLJIQ", "B003AWRMA6", "B000BNTMAA", "B00096S3YA", "B0006FYOU6", "B00JQHOFD6", "B00066FABM", "B003ASLJNQ", "B00AEFYTEY", "B00441GZ1Y", "B000TNJIJC", "B003AWRMCE", "B000H9HWQ4", "B003ASLJMW", "0739020404", "B00005QCVX", "0769260527", "B000005H9I", "B001CBW1IA", "B007UW9W5U", "B00FNPQW2W", "B000002I7U", "B003ASLJLS", "B00G4Q3KOC", "B00005AQML", "6304698801", "B0015XHQT4", "B0006IIPLM", "B00004STRD", "B004I6S8GU", "B00005JND5", "B000294SIY", "6305594333", "B00782O7LG", "B000KX0HFK", "B00005KHJJ", "B0026HLVT4", "B000ZM1MGE", "B000051YMP", "B00009Y3PV", "B000M4RG42", "B001FB55NK", "B007NPYP24", "0312425570", "B00E1LQEFE", "B000KG4BD6", "B0019I4XVE", "B00DZFKNFO", "B004MYFVQ8", "6305918880", "B0007TKOAA", "6304696515", "B00I3C1T7K"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0016OM3TU", "B000BVNS7U", "B0000DZ3HM", "B002TVQ4D0"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 230472}, "asin": "B000053V7P", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41pBq5PREXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Bird"}

{"description": "This latter-day sort-of Western from John Ford--falling midway betweenThe SearchersandThe Man Who Shot Liberty Valance--is a crisp retelling of a true-life episode from the Civil War. In 1863 a Union colonel named Grierson (Marlowe in the film, and John Wayne by any name) led his cavalry several hundred miles behind Confederate lines to cut the railroad between Newton Station and soon-to-be-embattled Vicksburg. Grierson's Raid was as successful as it was daring, and remarkably bloodless. Never fear that the screenplay makes up for that un-Hollywood lapse--as well as supplying amatory distraction for the colonel in the form of a feisty Southern belle (Constance Towers) who has to be dragged along to protect secrecy.There's a certain amount of bombast in the running arguments about wartime ethics between Marlowe and the new regimental surgeon (William Holden), who don't take to each other at all. But Ford more than makes up for it with such tasty scenes as an encounter with a couple of redneck Rebel deserters (Denver Pyle and Strother Martin), an ethereal swamp crossing led by a cornpone deacon (Hank Worden), and above all the famous skirmish with a hillside full of grade-school cadets from a venerable military academy. The film ends rather abruptly because Ford abandoned a climactic battle scene--the veteran stunt man and bit player Fred Kennedy having been killed in a horse fall. Golden-age cowboy star Hoot Gibson, who acted in Ford's directorial debut,Straight Shooting, appears as Sergeant Brown.--Richard T.

There's nearly an hour of behind-the-footage material, all of it superior made-for-cable featurettes so often included on DVDs. The technicians divulge little tricks of the trade, revealing more computer effects in the film than you'd think. Longtime Eastwood editor Joel Cox provides insight into the director's work routine. The highlight, though, is an extended version of the four principles' appearance onThe Tonight Show, with Jay Leno providing some interesting comments on how he chooses what films will \"appear\" on his show.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B003ASLJOU", "B00388PK7O", "B003ASLJJU", "B000N3SSBW", "B003AWRMA6", "0790731460", "0783225733", "B003AWRM9W", "B00AEFXVOI", "B003AWRMC4", "B001M9ELQ2", "B003ASLJNQ", "B002GHHHP6", "B003ASLJKE", "B003ASLJO0", "B003ASLJRC", "B003ASLJS6", "B004GJYRI2", "B00DDT0JB0", "B000055Y0Y", "B0015XHQT4", "B0002V7OI8", "B003AWRMCE", "B003ASLJIQ", "B003ASLJPE", "B003ASLJMW", "B00000G3PA", "B003AWRMBU", "B00005JPLE", "B003ASLJQI", "B00E8G5HQE", "B0045HCJ0S", "B003AWRMCY", "B000JYW5BE", "B00008CMT4", "0783225547", "B0001FVDJQ", "6304711891", "6305213283", "0792838408", "B000U1ZV8K", "B00368PSKK", "B003AWRM9M", "B0015NORDW", "B0003JAOCC", "B007XTDWKQ", "6304765258", "B00KLEYXZS", "B00008G7QH", "6304698801", "B002M9WW3A", "B00003CWU3", "B003Q6D2B4", "B000U1ZV62", "B00AEFYUQQ", "B003ASLJK4", "B00096S4DK", "0767803434", "B002GIBVVG", "B002NZK5R8", "B003AT9D74", "B0045HCJFS", "B002N57KG2", "B002Z7FWBI", "B00AEFYTEY", "B000PHVZNE", "B000EQHXOG", "6305236569", "B00008G8M4", "B00003CXHJ", "0780622650", "B00005JA9F", "B00006SFKE", "B0000TANUI", "B00004YA66", "B00026ZG10", "B0000YTP02", "B00AEBB9WI", "B002OGMGV4", "B000KGGIV4", "B0006FYOTC", "B000YAF4MA", "B00AEFXPSK", "0783230346", "B001NFNFIK", "B00936A1ZG", "B00015YVDG", "B002GHHHKQ", "B000W1SZBS", "B000JJSJPK", "B001B3LIOC", "B00008OE4W", "0767827813", "B000P0J0EM", "B00ALTQRRK", "B00AEFXRG0", "B00BTYNXL4", "B00000IQC4", "B00DHD933W", "B000FO0A9W"], "bought_together": ["B003ASLJOU"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00DDT0JB0", "B003ASLJRC", "B000N3SSBW", "B00388PK7O"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 22001}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.89, "brand": "Warner", "asin": "B00005ALS2", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51wRmrOwiQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Space Cowboys"}
{"description": "The Fall of the House of Usher's success in 1960 spurred American International Pictures to quickly launch another production based on an Edgar Allan Poe story. While producer-director Roger Corman had hoped to next adapt \"The Masque of the Red Death\" (which wasn't produced until 1964),Pit and the Pendulum(the onscreen title) became the second in AIP's long-running Poe series. Set in post-Inquisition Spain, the film stars John Kerr as a young Englishman who travels to the seaside castle of his brother-in-law (Vincent Price) to uncover the circumstances behind the death of his sister (a dubbed Barbara Steele). Price is tormented by memories of his mother's premature burial by his inquisitor father (also Price) and fears that this sadistic legacy has contributed to Steele's demise. Furthermore, he believes that Steele was also buried alive--a belief compounded by the mysterious destruction of her room, and the sound of her harpsichord playing in the night...Structured almost identically toUsher, Richard Matheson's script fleshes out the brief original text with a fast-paced and twist-filled plot that never loses sight of the psychological themes of Poe's work. It also provides Price with the richest of his many AIP/Poe roles, a sympathetic, deeply emotional man who is unhinged by the sins of his father. Corman's direction is equally driven and fluid, and features some impressive quasi-psychedelic visuals in the tense climax. Also noteworthy is art director's Daniel Haller's impressive design of the title set piece. MGM's widescreen DVD features commentary by Corman, which focuses primarily on the film's technical aspects. Also included is the original trailer and a prologue (shot byNorma Raeproducer Tamara Asseyev) featuring costar Luana Anders, which was added to fill out the film's 1968 television broadcast.--Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005AUK0", "B00009PY4D", "B00009PY4A", "B00009PY45", "B000068TPE", "B00009NHBC", "B001BSBBGC", "B0007R4SZY", "B000068TPF", "B000067DCX", "B00005NSXY", "B008BWFOXM", "B000RO9PUU", "B00000JMOF", "0792846893", "B002945DUW", "B00005K3OD", "B000RXVNDI", "B00005NKTH", "B001SGEUFQ", "B00009PY48", "B00HRUQ8X4", "B005AMJ36U", "B000VUQ4HW", "B0000AGWMC", "B0000AUHOK", "B001PMRBMW", "B0009X770O", "B00B94VJYW", "B0007R4T26", "B005AMJ2ZM", "B000EHSVJG", "B007ZFSBWW", "B008BWFOZA", "B005AMJ3B0", "B001BSBBNK", "B00005LC4K", "B00005JKU0", "B004X63SCY", "B000PWQP9I", "B0075B2G90", "B0000542CL", "B00000JQB7", "B001B9ZVVC", "B00E0FW0M2", "B000062XEY", "B00009NHAB", "B00005AUKA", "B001L5Y78Y", "B009AGEY98", "B000UDGOBG", "B00317LM8S", "B00005AUK3", "B0034PWPHY", "B0016KCCCC", "0767817664", "B00FUABJJQ", "B000P0J0BU", "B0002CX1M0", "B0009X770E", "B00000K3U3", "B00DOZNI8Y", "B000U1ZV7G", "B0000694WH", "B00518A70E", "0790742829", "6304936532", "B000787YRM", "B00009PY38", "B002LBGB7W", "B0000A9GHP", "B004AZ7ZLI", "B006TTC5J0", "B007Y1NNAW", "B00005KHJP", "0783240961", "078323502X", "B00007JMD8", "B000035Z3K", "B000B7MX7A", "B000A0GOFK", "B00006JMQH", "B00DZP1C9K", "B000A0GOF0", "B003MJZ07E", "B0016LFUVQ", "6305944288", "B0038MC1FO", "B00005AUK1", "B0007R4T3A", "B000B7MX70", "B0076ANKTK", "B004P9UWL4", "B00005LC4N", "B004W6JJXC", "B000IMUYJM", "B00BRT3DBQ", "B001DB6J4Q", "B0000542CM", "B0087ZG7UW"], "bought_together": ["B00005AUK0", "B00009PY4D"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005AMJ36U", "B005AMJ3B0", "B00005AUK0", "B0007R4T12"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 44281}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 24.59, "brand": "", "asin": "B00005AUK4", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51XYNXSHYJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Pit and the Pendulum (Midnite Movies)"}

{"description": "The originalMimicaspired to evoke a mood and tension akin to classic horror films like the original versions ofThe MummyorFrankenstein--to create the kind of dream imagery that lingers in the brain for months after. This may seem like a high ambition for a movie about giant predatory bugs that learned to roughly imitate the appearance of human beings, butMimicwas more successful than you'd expect. And so isMimic 2, a movie with much simpler goals--Mimic 2just wants to be a lean, effective horror flick that capitalizes on the inherent creepiness of insects. A schoolteacher named Remi (Alix Koromzay, previously seen inChildren of the Corn 666: Isaac's Returnand the remake ofThe Haunting) has trouble with men, but not half as much trouble as they end up having with her; every guy she's recently dated has been killed and had his face sheared off. Before too long, her school has a serious infestation of giant mutant cockroaches. By the end, the story is full of holes--butMimic 2does a smart job of delaying any explanation for a long time while building some compelling eeriness and successful jolts. The special effects are sparingly used and surprisingly good when they do appear; Koromzay and costar Bruno Campos are engaging presences. All in all, worth checking out.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000ARD7S", "B004XVMCN0", "B00AEFYXQI", "B005BQTUVI", "B008JFUNYG", "B00005JPUN", "0783225547", "B00AQSN620", "B00AEFY2WI", "B003VA3JUO", "B000FFJZO2", "B00153ZR8G", "B00BNAE14W", "6305090564", "0792839722", "B000A6T1ZY", "B00008AOVO", "B000AM4P9K", "B0001O3YD0", "B00B58FV82", "B00005RHGK", "B00BOXZAJ8", "B0077PTWLO", "B009DH378I", "B00003CY6P", "B000U1ZV8K", "B001JNNDJM", "6305258287", "B00BEIYG98", "B00005JLZK", "B000OVLBHG", "B004ULNJIU", "B00008G8M4", "B00BUAEYVK", "B001TZQ4UA", "B00008DDUZ", "B0012IX35I", "B0051O0NHK", "B0066NR8PU", "B00ED5OGKS", "B000063JZP", "B0002RQ3MA", "B000067J2Z"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0077PTWLO", "B004XVMCN0", "B00AEFYXQI", "B000IY04Q8"]}, "price": 6.94, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 244227}, "asin": "B00005BCKJ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41J0N78V0RL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Mimic 2"}
{"description": "Antoine Fuqua (THE REPLACEMENT KILLERS, BAIT) turns up the intensity level with TRAINING DAY, a charged drama about police corruption in downtown Los Angeles. Ethan Hawke stars as Jake Hoyt, a well-intentioned young officer who thinks he's found his ticket to becoming a detective in the form of undercover officer Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington). Harris is a notorious figure in the streets and in the office. He also has the authority to make Jake's professional wishes come true, provided Jake is able to prove his worth on Alonzo's team. At first, Alonzo's blunt, carefree demeanor provides a shock to Jake's optimistic system, but as it becomes clear that Alonzo is dangerously out of control, Jake must decide whether or not to risk his future in the name of the law.\n\nWashington's performance as the evil, pragmatic detective is a sight to behold. He delivers his lines with a devilish ferocity that keeps the film bubbling throughout. Hawke slips into the role of the rookie everyman with ease, providing a good contrast to Washington's fiery presence. Former video director Fuqua completes the picture by casting musicians Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre, and Macy Gray in supporting roles.", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792841778", "630268644X", "6303012140", "6300214826"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 428216}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.0, "brand": "", "asin": "B00005JKEC", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/415AYTB1GNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Training Day [VHS]"}

{"description": "WithThe Return of the King, the greatest fantasy epic in film history draws to a grand and glorious conclusion. Director Peter Jackson's awe-inspiring adaptation of the Tolkien classicThe Lord of the Ringscould never fully satisfy those who remain exclusively loyal to Tolkien's expansive literature, but as a showcase for physical and technical craftsmanship it is unsurpassed in pure scale and ambition, setting milestone after cinematic milestone as the brave yet charmingly innocent Hobbit Frodo (Elijah Wood) continues his mission to Mordor, where he is destined to destroy the soul-corrupting One Ring of Power in the molten lava of Mount Doom. While the heir to the kingdom of Men, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), endures the massive battle at Minas Tirith with the allegiance of the elf Legolas (Orlando Bloom), dwarf Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) and the great wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen), Frodo and stalwart companion Samwise Gamgee (Sean Astin) must survive the schizoid deceptions of Gollum, who remains utterly convincing as a hybrid of performance (by Andy Serkis) and subtly nuanced computer animation.Jackson and cowriters Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens have much ground to cover; that they do so with intense pacing and epic sweep is impressive enough, but by investing greater depth and consequence in the actions of fellow Hobbits Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd), they ensure thatReturn of the Kingmaintains the trilogy's emphasis on intimate fellowship. While several major characters appear only briefly, and one (Christopher Lee's evil wizard, Saruman) relegated entirely to the extended version on DVD, Jackson is to be commended for his editorial acumen; like Legolas the archer, his aim as a filmmaker is consistently true, and he remains faithful to Tolkien's overall vision. IfReturnsuffers from too many endings, as some critic suggested, it's only because the epic's conclusion is so loyally inclusive of the actors--most notably Astin--who gave it such strength to begin with. By ending theLOTRtrilogy with noble integrity and faith in the power of imaginative storytelling,The Return of the King, like its predecessors, will stand as an adventure for the ages.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JKZV", "B00003CWT6", "B00BEZTMFY", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B002ZG980U", "B002PMV9FG", "B008UZA8FY", "B001NGML48", "B00005JM5E", "B001GZ6QC4", "B005COPWZW", "B008M4C1EO", "B00HFFE8HE", "039548930X", "B000W7F5SS", "B000I0RQVI", "B002VWNIDG", "B000E6EK2Y", "B001BYMX4A", "B004M1A21K", "B007K3JFUQ", "B001DHXT20", "B001UV4XHY", "0345325818", "B003Y5H54W", "B00005JNJV", "B00E5I2M6I", "B000A3XY5A", "B004LWZWGA", "B000U7WV1Y", "B005LXQLRW", "B001OQCV6A", "B000E8M0VA", "B004SIP8ZM", "B000EHRVMY", "0618640150", "B003ZK99NQ", "B0013FDM7E", "B00005JPH2", "B000UNYK4E", "B009JBWOU0", "B00003CX5P", "B00008G8M5", "B00GKOJ98E", "B004LWZW42", "B000H30B2C", "B000P0J0C4", "B00CZDLGDU", "B000M341QE", "B00008G8M4", "B000FKO5QK", "B00HWWUQYY", "B007SPPANM", "B008JFUO72", "B001DJLD1M", "0345538374", "B00AEFY5B6", "B00005JKCH", "B004SIP9U6", "B000YGGNMO", "B00E5I2M9K", "0618126988", "B005OCFGTO", "B00E8S2JZ4", "6305313687", "B004AKCME8", "B0002KVUKM", "B000AARKOO", "B0006GAO5Y", "B000K7VHQ4", "B002ZG997C", "B00AHTYI5M", "B008JFUS0U", "B0042MEQVG", "B00275EGWY", "B00E9PMML2", "B008UZDXEW", "B004SIP7F8", "B00116GEJS", "B00003CXI1", "B003ZKBELG", "B003Y5H5EW", "B000V4UFZK", "B0007PLLBU", "B001DTPZNY", "B002O3Z50Q", "B001GCUO1Q", "B000LP6KNU", "B005G4TJUC", "B00AW0KHTM", "B002ZG97YM", "054792819X", "B00AEFXZJE", "B0000YEEGM", "B002IPFWTE", "B001ECQ75A", "B000065U1N", "B0051MKNV8", "B000W796OM", "B00J49R1BY"], "bought_together": ["B00005JKZV", "B00003CWT6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00HFFE8HE", "B00003CWT6", "B00005JKZV", "B00BEZTMFY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 1589}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.49, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00005JKZY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HS7iSFv5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)"}

{"description": "The first disc starts with a 38-minute interview with Salma Hayek that, with her recollections of the film, works the same as a commentary track. Director Julie Taymor takes center stage for the rest of the 2-disc set. Besides an engaging commentary track, there are two interviews with the director, a Q&A; session after an AFI screening, and a better one with Bill Moyers. The second disc is set-up for short (5- to 7-minute) featurettes on the making of the film--production design, cinematography, locations, two visual effects pieces, and so on--but oddly not one with the Oscar-winning make-up crew. All of these segments are better produced and more interesting than most DVD supplements, however there is little biographical information on Frida (letting the movie speak for itself). The music element gets the most attention: an interview with vocalist and Frida's lover Chavela Vargas, Hayek interviewing composer Elliot Goldenthal, and Goldenthal's own commentary track explaining his Oscar-winning score.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0030T120A", "B00005KHJJ", "B000CCCZYA", "B00116GEJ8", "B004XVMCMG", "B0001US61O", "B003ODIV10", "B000BYA4HY", "B005TTEG3O", "0060085894", "B0011FLH14", "B0043CT8GI", "B00006LLNV", "B001CK7OLU", "B000AL72R8", "3822859834", "B0041I97CO", "B000N3T0DW", "B005CFBZ3O", "0060923199", "B003WKQ46E", "B00005JNCZ", "0517592355", "B000WZAE7W", "B0006GANX2", "B0051URXWM", "B000FIHN5M", "B0000A2ZU1", "B001ILTUKQ", "0448426773", "B0009K7RXY", "B0002TT0MI", "B00180IPM6", "3836512645", "B00005N8A9", "B0041KKYF6", "B000NO1XG8", "0810959542", "B000YKYT2G", "1451632835", "B00134PSV8", "B00EV1YZKK", "B000NVI0EY", "B002ZMZBIM", "B00005JLQW", "1452108250", "B00AZMFKXK", "0060166991", "B00005R87F", "B000AM4P90", "B004IF4EVY", "B000EZ9084", "B001CK7OM4", "B000T5O4AI", "B00GJNQ3S0", "0486413500", "0486413667", "B000O76ZQC", "B00008AOX5", "B004U7MR1Y", "B001DJ7PR8", "B00275EGNS", "B003VTKZ8O", "B00E5G03KM", "B000NOIX48", "B0002KPIQY", "0452286867", "B001FM7KRI", "B000063N9O", "B000YIGNCC", "B00005JMJD", "0811800393", "3822858625", "6304806418", "B0031REQKE", "B004CJQVQC", "B00049QJ9I", "0516264664", "B000063K0I", "B00008PHD1", "0780619587", "B001BWYT4E", "B000LV6OC6", "B0016LFG2Y", "B006HAJAGM", "B000K7VHNW", "B00005JH9M", "B000NTPG84", "B0016MJ6T2", "B001QUF3SW", "B00BLYCB1K", "B0019K4YT8", "B0064MT1FI", "B00GPPXNIK", "B003BR8MDQ", "B000AARKOO", "B0015ET3YO", "1573440299", "B000092T3B"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000CCCZYA", "B00005KHJJ", "0060085894", "B004XVMCMG"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 123302}, "asin": "B00005JLPK", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51F4umWFdiL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Frida"}

{"description": "A Beautiful Mindmanages to twist enough pathos out of John Nash's incredible life story to redeem an at-times goofy portrayal of schizophrenia. Russell Crowe tackles the role with characteristic fervor, playing the Nobel prize-winning mathematician from his days at Princeton, where he developed a groundbreaking economic theory, to his meteoric rise to the cover ofForbesmagazine and an MIT professorship, and on through to his eventual dismissal due to schizophrenic delusions. Of course, it is the delusions that fascinate director Ron Howard and, predictably, go astray. Nash's other world, populated as it is by a maniacal Department of Defense agent (Ed Harris), an imagined college roommate who seems straight out ofDead Poets Society, and an orphaned girl, is so fluid and scriptlike as to make the viewer wonder if schizophrenia is really as slick as depicted. Crowe's physical intensity drags us along as he works admirably to carry the film on his considerable shoulders. No doubt the story of Nash's amazing will to recover his life without the aid of medication is a worthy one, his eventual triumph heartening.

{"description": "Three men relive their carefree college years by killing off as many  brain cells as possible in this over-the-top comedy. Mitch (Luke Wilson)  returns home from a less-than-pleasant business trip one evening to  discover his wife, Heidi (Juliette Lewis), involved in a m&eacute;nage &agrave; trois  with two blindfolded strangers. Feeling less than welcome at home after  this, Mitch rents a house near the campus of a nearby college; two of  Mitch's old college buddies, Beanie (Vince Vaughn) and Frank (Will  Ferrell), stop by to cheer him up. They soon become regular guests at  Mitch's place, despite the fact that Frank only recently wed Marissa  (Perrey Reeves), while Beanie and his wife, Lara (Leah Remini), are busy  with two kids. Beanie decides to throw a housewarming party for Mitch,  and since Beanie sells audio equipment for a living, he's able to trick  out the big bash with a massive PA system and an appearance by Snoop  Dogg. Mitch soon finds he's the not-entirely-willing proprietor of the  school's leading party spot, which raises the ire of Pritchard (Jeremy  Piven), a dean at the college who was the target of Mitch, Frank, and  Beanie's abuse when they were all students. Pritchard arranges to have  Mitch's neighborhood zoned into a student housing district, but Beanie  and Frank respond by forming a fraternity and making Mitch's home their  headquarters. Mitch, however, is not enthusiastic about the idea,  especially as he's trying to impress Nicole (Ellen Pompeo), a beautiful  divorcee who is less than enchanted with Frank and Beanie's \"party  hearty\" lifestyle.Old Schooldirector Todd Phillips knows more than a  bit about the seamy side of fraternity life as director of the infamous  unreleased documentaryFrat House.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000BKVQS4", "B001G5T6GW", "B000J4P9P8", "B000WZEZGI", "B00005JMYI", "B00005JNZU", "B0016MOV92", "B00AEFXJS6", "B001OD4S50", "B0009HBPN0", "B002ZG99H2", "B00AEFYZCU", "B001J9KJ4I", "B00AEFYPXY", "B000EMGJAO", "B008220BGQ", "B002Q4VBPQ", "B004EPZ084", "B000JJ4DNW", "B00AEBB8FQ", "B00005JKMN", "B000069CF0", "B0000A02TZ", "B008R65XNS", "B002IKIHEG", "B00AEFYAMA", "B000BKJ762", "B003Y5H5B0", "B000IZJZIU", "B00AEBB9K0", "B000CPH9PM", "B00AEBBA2C", "B0050PYNN0", "B003CRM6PA", "B000AP04L0", "630529142X", "B00B65JMEI", "B0006GANPA", "B000TZJBPQ", "B003VPX5Y4", "B002ZG97XI", "B004EPYZS0", "B00466HN7M", "B001C0JCBA", "B0083XXVFW", "B000A7DVR2", "B00029RTAI", "B00CE00ZV8", "B005LAII12", "B00007AJGM", "B008R65XYC", "B00BEIYMZ6", "B000ELJAEM", "B008R65XTC", "B004SIP95G", "B00AEFXVW0", "B00AIQARTU", "B00003CXWV", "B000P0J09M", "B00005JMX6", "B004HO6I2E", "B002BIULKS", "B00AEFZ3XU", "B0012IWNZY", "B00BNWWYE4", "B0023TCWE8", "B00363WGBO", "0783229526", "B00AEBB9DM", "B0002V7TMY", "B000E6EHE0", "B0009X761E", "B00029RTCG", "B0002F6BRE", "B0002I84FI", "B0051MKNRC", "B003BV8IC2", "B00005JL93", "B000EGDBZ6", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00AEFYFWA", "B000P0J09W", "B00DV2MVWO", "B008R65XUQ", "B000M341QE", "B00AEBB9GY", "B00003CXPS", "B000HCPS94", "B005LAII2Q", "B00H9KKGTO", "B00AEFXIUK", "B00407PO3W", "B00AEFY5B6", "B004EPZ06G", "B004LWZW5G", "B00AEFZ8OY", "B003Y5H5C4", "B00011CZRE", "B00AEFYVMO", "B00004Z4WR"], "bought_together": ["B001G5T6GW", "B000J4P9P8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001G5T6GW", "B000WZEZGI", "B000J4P9P8", "B003Y5H5B0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 27583}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.99, "brand": "Dreamworks Skg", "asin": "B00005JM1F", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51MFGXVNN8L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Old School (Widescreen Unrated Edition)"}

The story finds Earth's post-World War III humankind in a state of severe emotional repression: If no one feels anything, no one will be inspired by dark passions to attack their neighbors. Writer-director Kurt Wimmer's monochromatic,Metropolis-influenced cityscape provides an excellent backdrop to the heavy-handed mission of John Preston (Christian Bale), a top cop who busts \"sense offenders\" and crushes sentimental, sensual, and artistic relics from a bygone era. Predictably, Preston becomes intrigued by his victims and that which they die to cherish; he stops taking his mandatory, mood-flattening drug and is even aroused by a doomed prisoner (Emily Watson). Wimmer's wrongheaded martial arts/dueling guns motif is sheer silliness (a battle over a puppy doesn't help), butEquilibriumshould be seen for Bale's moving performance as a man shocked back to human feeling.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00006JDVV", "B000LC55F2", "B000FS9FCG", "B0009A40ES", "B000KX0IM2", "B0007Y08QA", "B00AEFYCW8", "0767805712", "B00005JL78", "B0018O4YT0", "B001FB55HQ", "B00003CXZ4", "B00AEFXCLU", "B000FGGE68", "B000WMA6R8", "B002ZG980U", "B003XURDAY", "B00HOGBXS6", "B00005JPAR", "B000GFLKF8", "B00K2CHX9C", "B00AEFXW8I", "B000XR9L50", "B004XQO90O", "B000N6TX1I", "B000FKO5QK", "B004SIP9Z6", "B007WZTMCI", "B0007DFJ0G", "B000093FLA", "B0073U2FB2", "0783225814", "B000K7VHQ4", "B001OQCVI8", "B00011CZRE", "B000P0J0AQ", "B00000JSJC", "B0000AXE8I", "B008JFUQZ2", "B007X4ECMI", "B002ZG97CO", "B00AZMFJYA", "B008JFUO36", "B004P2VQZC", "B0000AC8LR", "B0045HCJT4", "B00J5LXT6M", "B00AEFY5B6", "B002UZCJ8Y", "B001GZ6QC4", "B00177Y9ZC", "B003UESJHO", "B000XA5K48", "B001DJLD1M", "B008JFUN50", "B005LAIHXQ", "B00K7IPFSM", "B0006IIPIK", "B005LAII8A", "B0013PSTMC", "B008JFUNHI", "B001L57ZYM", "B002QEHPQU", "B0034G4ORC", "B004SIP95G", "0767802519", "B001TOD92C", "B008JFUS0U", "B000087F6L", "B0051MKNV8", "B007WXUVHU", "B005LAIH2C", "B000R9U3B0", "B004LWZW7E", "B000MZHW40", "B00005JNJV", "B00005JPD0", "B000GGSMC6", "B0000ACOXL", "B0085A9HU6", "B009YQJ322", "B003Y5H5GK", "B009MO57H6", "B004LWZW4M", "0800195175", "B002QW7ALM", "B00005JMA8", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B001EAWMGA", "B002O3Z4WU", "B000BW7QWW", "B001GUYB08", "B00005V9HH", "B001UV4XWY", "B00A8MGIZG", "B002GSXKNI", "B00IARA8KM", "B004LWZWGA", "B00005JA8B", "B001QTXM5Y"], "bought_together": ["B000LC55F2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0007Y08QA", "B006ZL1PGG", "B000LC55F2", "B004P7CMJG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 61424}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.34, "brand": "Dimension", "asin": "B00005JLWN", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51K2WVH130L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Equilibrium"}
{"description": "More sex. More violence. That's what you get in the unrated director's cut ofTaking Lives, which ought to tell you where director D.J. Caruso's priorities lie. The hot scenes between Angelina Jolie and Ethan Hawke are extended (offering a bit more nudity for Jolie's lecherous fans), and the fate of Gena Rowlands's character isconsiderablymore graphic, but none of the added footage makes the movie any better or worse. That said, this cynical director's cut is the only version worth buying if you're looking to fill out your serial-killer-thriller collection (or your movies-in-which-Jolie-gets-naked collection), and you might as well enjoy the gag reel outtakes because they contain the only footage on the entire DVD in which Jolie cracks a genuine smile. The four featurettes are really just one standard-issue promo reel chopped into thematic categories with a pretentiousCSIvibe, and while they offer little of substance, seasoned film buffs will welcome the appearance of veteran British editor Anne V.

On the surface, there's nothing out of the ordinary here with the exception of a few minutes of rehearsal footage, but everything is just so darn interesting to watch. Mann and his stars dish about the making of the film, including the creation of Cruise's assassin. The nighttime shooting (shot digitally and transferred sublimely) is examined along with a single deleted scene (with a clear explanation on why it was cut). Think the climatic finale aboard a train was shot on a subway for convenience? No, Mann just wanted to control the backgrounds!

Decipher the clues and unlock the next set of extras: a nice bit on real treasure hunters, an awful piece on the Knights Templar, and one gem for kids: \"Riley Poole's Decode this!\" Actor Justin Bartha reprises his role (Nic Cage's techno-sidekick) and lectures a bit on the cooler side of language history and code-breaking with a few simple interactive games. If you get through it all, you unlock a hidden feature, a trivia track. Thankfully, those who do not want to go on the treasure hunt can access these features by reading the printed insert.

{"description": "The supplemental features ofFahrenheit 9/11offer almost an hour and a half of further manna for Michael Moore's supporters and ammunition for his critics, including appearances by two of the most memorable figures in the film, Michigan mother Lila Lipscomb and Marine corporal Abdul Henderson.  \"The Release ofFahrenheit 9/11\" (11 minutes) collects reactions to the film from celebrities, political leaders, and Quentin Tarantino and Tilda Swinton of the 2004 Cannes Film Festival jury (but no film critics).  Lipscomb gives a moving speech at the film's Washington, D.C. premiere (4 minutes), and in an 18-minute sequence, an embedded Swedish journalist recounts his experiences, accompanied by footage of U.S. soldiers raiding an Iraqi home.  This provides the context for the scene in the main film in which a soldier gets his picture taken with a bound and hooded Iraqi, which is chillingly similar to the infamous pictures from Abu Ghraib prison.  The second part of the DVD features consists of seven new or extended scenes (about 50 minutes total), including more footage of Iraq before the invasion; protesters outside Abu Ghraib and former prisoners showing their injuries; more thoughts from Cpl. Abdul Henderson; National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice trying to squirm off the hook in front of the 9/11 Commission; and President Bush going through the motions of a press appearance after he appeared before the same commission.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000UNYJXQ", "B0030Y11XS", "B00008DDVV", "B00009YXAS", "B00008K76O", "B0030Y11O2", "B0002RQ2Q2", "B001G43C1S", "B00008L3TE", "B0041KKYBA", "B00068VAOG", "B000T28C5Y", "B000ICL3KG", "B000BTH4K4", "B002FOQY7M", "B0002OXVBO", "B001NMT8R0", "B001MFNB5I", "B001MVWFAO", "0743272927", "B000FBH3W2", "B0007DBJM8", "B000UYX4N6", "B0027BOL4G", "B000U6YJMO", "B00G0PXU2Y", "B00005JPXA", "B000GYHRHO", "B002EP8TQG", "B000C3L2IO", "B000JVSUSE", "B004EPYZDA", "B0016N52IK", "B001BEK8FQ", "B0041KKYBK", "B00KY6YAO2", "B00F12IRSO", "B00DYC648S", "B001F5274G", "B0001L3LUE", "B000HWXOT0", "B005FITIGO", "B003CJXJ8Q", "B0013D8LHM", "B00DPUB5LK", "044653224X", "B005KBJC0I", "B004FQX59I", "B00KUS5YGC", "B007KAUWO2", "B00GYG8BKK", "B000093NQZ", "B001P9G3HE", "B00483VQTE", "B003Q6D28C", "B001B7CNW4", "B000BBOUHM", "B00744WZ8U", "B00066VTBW", "B001KWB0L0", "B00443YDWK", "B000059TG8", "B000JLTRIQ", "B003JUINFM", "0060392452", "B000I5Y8FU", "B000BITURA", "B003XKNGLY", "B004EPYZDK", "B003M987AG", "B000PY52IG", "B006ML50QK", "B000QGE89W", "B00EK52XQK", "B00DENQEE6", "B000GH3CR0", "B0047UJBP4", "B00005J75F", "0446693790", "B0006N2DSI", "B001AEF6HM", "B00005JLYW", "B001J66JQI", "B000O0YV7O", "B002NPCJRC", "B00AZMFG48", "B0042KZJIC", "B00827OX5Q", "B0002HDXTQ", "B001E5FYS8", "B00AEBB89C", "B003H23KSM", "B000CEXEWA", "0615602223", "B006JN86VW", "B00914YLAG", "B0001IXT36", "B008PUI1GM", "B004SIP7ZS"], "bought_together": ["B000UNYJXQ", "B0030Y11XS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000UNYJXQ", "B0030Y11XS", "B00008DDVV", "B0002OXVBO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 44430}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.0, "brand": "From HIBISCUS EXPRESS, http://www.amazon.com/shops/AXD9LOVGJXES3", "asin": "B00005JNEI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51KDRVF1JGL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Fahrenheit 9/11"}

{"description": "Marvel Comics' first family of superherodom, the Fantastic Four, hits the big screen in a light-hearted and funny adventure.  It begins when down-on-his-luck genius Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd,Horatio Hornblower) has to enlist the financial and intellectual help from former schoolmate and rival Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon,Nip/Tuck) in order to pursue outer-space research into human DNA.  Also on the trip are Reed's best friend, Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis,The Shield); his former lover, Sue Storm (Jessica Alba,Dark Angel,Sin City), who's now Doom's employee and love interest; and her hotshot-pilot brother, Johnny Storm (Chris Evans,Cellular).  Things don't go as planned, of course, and the quartet becomes blessed--or is it cursed?--with superhuman powers: flexibility, brute strength, invisibility and projecting force fields, and bursting into flame.  Meanwhile, Doom himself is undergoing a transformation.Among the many entries in the comic-book-movie frenzy,Fantastic Fouris refreshing because it doesn't take itself too seriously. Characterization isn't too deep, and the action is a bit sparse until the final reel (like most \"first\" superhero movies, it has to go through the \"how did we get these powers and what we will do with them\" churn). But it's a good-looking cast, and original comic-book cocreator Stan Lee makes his most significant Marvel-movie cameo yet, in a speaking role as the FF's steadfast postal carrier, Willie Lumpkin. Newcomers to superhero movies might find the idea of a family with flexibility, strength, invisibility, and force fields a retread ofThe Incredibles, but Pixar's animated film was very much a tribute to the FF and other heroes of the last 40 years. The irony is that whileFantastic Fouris an enjoyable B-grade movie, it's the tribute,The Incredibles, that turned out to be a film for the ages.--David HoriuchiOn the DVDThe principal extra on the DVD is a spirited commentary track by Jessica Alba, Michael Chiklis, and Ioan Gruffud.  Self-avowed FF fan Chiklis explains why the Thing doesn't have a craggy brow, Alba recalls which things were \"cool,\" and they talk about looking forward to the sequel. There are three short deleted scenes (including a goofy Wolverine reference), 20 minutes of barely watchable hand-held video footage from the press tour, music videos, and some short featurettes including an appearance by FF creator Stan Lee.--David HoriuchiThe Fantastic Four at Amazon.comComics and Graphic NovelsDisney animated seriesThe classic comic bookMovie tie-in graphic novelThe Xbox gameFantastic FourSoundtrackThe Fantastic CastJessica Albaas Sue StormMichael Chiklisas The ThingIoan Gruffuddas Reed RichardsChris Evansas Johnny StormStills fromFantastic Four(click for larger images)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000VI70QS", "B0000959N0", "B001DHXT20", "B0007P0Y7C", "B004EPZ07K", "B001CDR1FG", "B00E5I2MEK", "B001GCUO1Q", "B00E5I2M9K", "B00E5I2MCM", "B000OVLBF8", "B00005JMQW", "B008JFUO72", "B004LWZW42", "B00E5I2M6I", "B000UR9T8C", "B0090SI56Y", "B000HEVZ9E", "B000HCO83Q", "B00005JKCH", "B005OY6LBE", "B001OQCVI8", "B008JFUS0U", "B004LWZWFQ", "B000AYELVU", "B0002IQMAM", "B003YAR97K", "B0083SBMBM", "B001QB9H1U", "B001AK3S4Y", "B005LAIGW8", "B000AYELVA", "B001F7MSFM", "B0006L0LOS", "B003H8F3AY", "B008JFUPFI", "B006DHAT5K", "B002GSXKN8", "B002ZG99G8", "B00005JNJV", "B002IPFWTE", "B002NXSRVG", "B000VR0570", "B0006D3HGA", "B004LWZWGA", "B005LAII44", "B000YV1Q2G", "B00F4FFO8E", "B005G4TJUC", "B00005JN0T", "B0007US7CQ", "B00E1HIXEI", "B000J10EQU", "B0002KVUKM", "B000VKL6T8", "B001TK80C0", "B002ZG99B8", "B000Y7U98C", "B002GSXKNI", "B00005JM5B", "B001GZ6QC4", "B000PFUAP0", "B00005JKWJ", "B0009P42WI", "B00174RCHW", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B00005JKYX", "B005TK0MFE", "B000VNMMPW", "B001QTXM5Y", "B000EU1Q7M", "B00008G8M4", "B000P6XQ50", "B00005JN5E", "B0007V6ITE", "B001VLBDD0", "B005LAIH54", "B001FB55HQ", "B000IJ79WU", "B008Y1YK9Y", "B00561BNJK", "B001VLFE7G", "B000CNER1S", "B00K7IPFSM", "B001BP4K22", "B00005JL78", "B0001CNRS4", "B00979KQD6", "B00157OI9Q", "B004EPYZUS", "B002HWRYJE", "B009YQJ322", "B003Y5H5EW", "0780624890", "B001RHGRT8", "B0013J55B6", "B0013BM63O", "B0053FANPY", "B009MO57H6", "078401132X"], "bought_together": ["B000VI70QS", "B001DHXT20"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000VI28Z6", "B000VI70QS", "B008JFUS0U", "B0090SI56Y"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 12162}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.98, "brand": "Twentieth Century Fox", "asin": "B00005JNTU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51AM4R5J04L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Fantastic Four (Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "With the slimmest extras package for a Pixar film debuting on DVD,Carsstill shines for home viewing. As with earlier digital-to-digital transfers, the film sounds and looks stunning. There is only one behind-the-scenes feature, a 16-minute cursory but entertaining glance at director John Lasseter's influences (his dad was a car-parts manager), including some of the real-life inspiration for the film such as Michael Wallis's influential book on Route 66 (he also voiced the sheriff). There's a new cartoon for the DVD, \"Mater and Ghost Light,\" which is smile-inducing at best. Four deleted scenes (in storybook format with voices) also show a darker tone the movie may have taken at one point. Best is the adorable short \"One Man Band\" that showed theatrically with the film, and the film's credit sequence can be seen full screen without the credits (and find the Easter egg for an extended version).

{"description": "Critics and controversy aside,The Da Vinci Codeis a verifiable blockbuster. Combine the film's huge worldwide box-office take with over 100 million copies of Dan Brown's book sold, andThe Da Vinci Codehas clearly made the leap from pop-culture hit to a certifiable franchise. The leap for any story making the move from book to big screen, however, is always more perilous. In the case ofThe Da Vinci Code, the plot is concocted of such a preposterous formula of elements that you wouldn&#x92;t envy screenwriter Akiva Goldsman, the man tasked with making this story filmable. The script followsDan Brown&#x92;s bookas closely as possible while incorporating a few needed changes, including a better ending. And if you&#x92;re like most of the world, by now you&#x92;ve read the book and know how it goes: while lecturing in Paris, noted Harvard Professor of Symbology Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) is summoned to the Louvre by French police to help decipher a bizarre series of clues left at the scene of the murder of the chief curator. Enter Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou), gifted cryptologist. Neveu and Langdon team up to solve the mystery, and from there the story is propelled across Europe, ballooning into a modern-day mini-quest for the Holy Grail, where secret societies are discovered, codes are broken, and murderous albino monks are thwarted&#x85; oh, and alternative theories about the life of Christ and the beginnings of Christianity are presented too, of course. It&#x92;s not the typical formula for a stock Hollywood thriller. In fact, taken solely as a mystery, the movie almost works--despite some gaping holes--mostly just because it keeps moving. Brown&#x92;s greatest trick was  to have the entire story take place in one day, so the action is forced to keep moving, despite some necessary pauses for exposition. As a screen couple, Hanks and Tautou are just fine together but not exactly memorable; meanwhile Sir Ian McKellen&#x92;s scenery-chewing as pivotal character Sir Leigh Teabing is just what the film needed to keep it from taking itself too seriously. The whole thing is like a good roller-coaster ride: try not to think too much about it--just sit back and enjoy the trip.--Daniel VanciniVisit The Da Vinci Code StoreOn The DVDThe DVD extras on a film as popular asThe Da Vinci Codeshould be plentiful, and this version doesn&#x92;t skimp. With over 90 minutes of special features, including ten behind-the-scenes featurettes, there&#x92;s a lot here to explore beyond the film itself. The question is, is there anything new here that we haven&#x92;t heard before, in all the hype, pseudo-documentaries, and controversy surrounding the movie, to make it worthwhile?  For most viewers, the answer will be \"yes.\" Essentially, if you like the movie, if you enjoyed the book, you will get a lot out of them.Just as the movie is intended to make the book come to life, the DVD extras should make the film come to life by pointing the audience into the world of the filmmakers, connecting the dots between print and film, and for the most part they do just that. The extras here range from the typical look behind-the-scenes to more in-depth features on the supporting characters, the locations, and theMona Lisaherself.  \"First Day on the Set with Ron Howard\" features the director gushing about the opportunity to film in the Louvre and work with Tom Hanks again (the two worked together before onSplashandApollo 13). It&#x92;s a short piece that doesn&#x92;t reveal much beyond making an attempt to share Howard&#x92;s excitement (with the \"Gee, I really loved working with him/her on this project\" that you hear in every such featurette), but viewers might enjoy seeing how the stage was set up in the famous museum, down to the spike tape on the floor showing actors where to hit their marks.The Filmmaking Experience, Parts 1 and 2further explores the creative and technical aspects of the filmmaking process.A Conversation with Dan Brownstarts out feeling like a puff-piece (the man who wrote this book got started at age 5 with a story calledThe Giraffe, The Pig, and the Pants on Fire. \"It was a thriller,\" he says.) and unfortunately it doesn&#x92;t go very deep into much of anything of interest. But on the other hand, this isn&#x92;t60 Minuteshere; it&#x92;s intended to give viewers a better sense of the man behind the franchise, which it does.  Much of the footage from this interview is sprinkled throughout some of the other featurettes. Meanwhile, the character behind the franchise, Robert Langdon, is examined in his own featurette, as is Sophie Neveu. The cool thing here is getting under the skin of the actors to see how they approached the characters, knowing that most of the movie-going public already has formed their own ideas about the characters from the book.The most interesting extras are the featurettes that focus on the history behind the mystery. Or is it the mystery behind the history?  Either way, the first one on theMona Lisa, and the second featurette on the many codes and symbols that are hidden throughout the movie balance out the remainder of the extras nicely by demonstrating the sense of intrigue, mystery, and game-playing adventure that madeThe Da Vinci Codeso popular in the first place.--Daniel VanciniBeyondThe Da Vinci CodeThe Films of Tom HanksThe Films of Ron HowardThe Da Vinci DVDs: Decoding \"The Da Vinci Code\"More About The ArtistStills fromThe Da Vinci Code(click for larger image)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002O5M4T4", "B00005JN5E", "B0013BM63O", "B002ZTQVKM", "B0007XG02W", "B001OLP2TI", "B002C68WNW", "0307474275", "B002O5M4SU", "B00005JLSB", "B000PHVZNE", "B0077ATSSQ", "B00AEFY0F2", "B000EPR7NE", "0743486226", "B001LMAK9W", "B000P0J0EW", "0385504209", "B005HWAOP2", "B001OQCV2E", "B0013XZ2QK", "B001EZE5D8", "B00005JL3T", "B000EOTW0Q", "6304711891", "B000YDBPAM", "0307950689", "B000HT386M", "B00008G8M4", "B000P0J0EM", "B002ZG99KO", "0800141806", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B00001ZWUS", "B0002V7OI8", "B002O3Z50Q", "B0006GANOQ", "B002NZK5UU", "B000NQRR1Q", "0385504225", "B004SIP7ZS", "B00005Y71F", "B000OYC7BW", "B00DL48BM6", "B00026ZG10", "B0018CWW5K", "B00004BZIY", "B0000B1OFL", "B00023B1LC", "B000N6U0E2", "B00A8MGIZG", "B00005JM5E", "B002LMV7R0", "B00004Z4WR", "B000K2UGXO", "B00005JMYC", "B001MVYUQG", "B00005JLWN", "B000056PMU", "B0000AOV4I", "B00AEFY4CG", "B00441GYXS", "B001F12J0C", "B00ES28X3C", "B002ZG980U", "B001VLBDD0", "B00008K76U", "B001TK80C0", "B008JFURII", "B000VWYJ86", "0792159659", "B00AEFYGBA", "B0009MDPYM", "B00177YA1K", "B00005N5S5", "B0043X1FM2", "B0002J58HO", "B00005JM5B", "B00AZMFJYA", "B003AWRMBA", "074349346X", "B003VA3JUO", "0783240295", "6305767866", "B0000844I8", "B000065U1N", "B002GHHHKQ", "B000K7VHQE", "B0000AXE8I", "0800177258", "B000ASDFGI", "B003Q6D2B4", "B000HRMAPE", "B000U7WV1Y", "B00005JMOW", "B00GPWEPZ8", "0312944926", "B000VI70QS", "B000KF0GWW"], "bought_together": ["B002O5M4T4", "B00005JN5E"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002O5M4T4", "B00I563DSC", "B0013BM63O", "1400079152"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 7555}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.5, "brand": "DaVinci", "asin": "B00005JOC9", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51SLBDLMtIL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Da Vinci Code (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition)"}
{"description": "Literary adaptations just don't get any better than director Joe Wright's 2005 version of Jane Austen'sPride & Prejudice. The key word here isadaptation, because Wright and gifted screenwriter Deborah Moggach have taken liberties with Austen's classic novel that purists may find objectionable, but in this exquisite film their artistic decisions are entirely justified and exceptionally well executed. It's a more rural England that we see here, circa 1790 (as opposed to Austen's early 19th century), in which Elizabeth Bennet (Keira Knightley) is one of several sisters primed for marriage, with an anxious mother (Brenda Blethyn) only too desperate to see her daughters paired off with the finest, richest husbands available. Elizabeth is strong-willed and opinionated, but her head (not to mention her pride and prejudice) lead her heart astray when she meets the wealthy Mr. Darcy (Matthew Macfadyen), whose own sense of decency and discretion (not to mentionhispride and prejudice) prevent him from expressing his mutual affection. They're clearly meant for each other, and as Knightley's performance lights up the screen (still young enough to be girlishly impertinent, yet wise beyond her 20 years), Austen's timeless romance yields yet another timeless adaptation, easily on par with the belovedBBC miniseriesthat has been embraced by millions since originally broadcast in 1995. Individual tastes will vary as to which version should be considered \"definitive,\" but with a stellar supporting cast including Judi Dench and Donald Sutherland, this impeccable production achieves its own kind of perfection.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_viewed": ["0800141660", "B00003JRCQ", "B00G6HO368", "B004SIP7AS", "B004P7CNZO", "B0053Q9DHW", "B000244FDW", "B000GRUQKQ", "B000244FFU", "B0018YCF50", "B001L57ZZG", "B004XVMCMQ", "B00AF82WTO", "B008D1RCHC", "B000Z27HLS", "B000BEZQ0Y", "0767851013", "0486284735", "B0002ZH5PQ", "B0012Q3T6I", "6303921248", "B002XTBE6K", "B001PJRAUS", "B00HYMBAQ0", "B0080QOL1A", "B00062IZ0Y", "B001C4AFOY", "B0012XIGVE", "B002KHNFFS", "B000244FF0", "B0012OVCE6", "B00HYMASS6", "B0009UZGAA", "B000784WMW", "0767020308", "B000LPQ6DE", "B001TJYFRU", "B000FTCEYQ", "B000ZS8GW6", "B005GRF2UK", "B004FM2EL2", "B00G7QPXAI", "149440477X", "B009ERK0SW", "B00006ZXSK", "B0000AUHPK", "B004UOHNCA", "0767020294", "B00094AS9U", "B000Z27HMW", "B002DY9KR0", "B000N4SHOE", "B000683VI4", "193799418X"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00G6HO368", "0800141660", "B00003JRCQ", "B005S9EK5Y"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "asin": "B00005JOHI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZGC68T2JL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Pride &amp; Prejudice"}

In 90 breathtaking minutes of efficient and intricate storytelling, writer-director George Clooney and cowriter Grant Heslov pay honorable tribute to the journalistic integrity of legendary CBS newscaster Edward R. Murrow,Director George Clooneywho confronted the virulent and overzealous anti-Communist witch-hunting of Wisconsin Sen. Joseph McCarthy in 1953-54, and emerged as a triumphant truth-seeker against the abuses of corporate and governmental power.David Strathairn as Edward R. MurrowAs played by David Strathairn, Murrow is a dogged realist, keenly aware of the smear tactics that will be employed against him; Clooney provides crucial backup as Murrow's \"See It Now\" producer and closest confidante Fred Friendly, forming a fierce but not entirely fearless triumvirate of broadcasting  bravery with CBS chief William Paley (Frank Langella), who anxiously champions Murrow's cause under constant threat of reprisals. While using crisp black-and-white cinematography (by Robert Elswit) to vividly recreate the electrifying atmosphere of the CBS newsroom and the early years of television, Clooney (son of long-time Cincinnati newsman Nick Clooney) proves his directorial skill by juggling big themes and an esteemed ensemble cast, never stooping to simplification of ethically complex material.Good Night, and Good Luckis an instant classic, destined for all the accolades it so richly deserves.--Jeff ShannonLearn More About Edward R.

{"description": "Helen Mirren reigns supreme inThe Queen, a witty and ingenious look at a moment that rocked the house of Windsor:  the week that followed the sudden death of Princess Diana in 1997. Diana's death came at just the same time that Prime Minister Tony Blair (played by the bright Michael Sheen) was settling into his new government--and trying to figure out the delicate relationship between 10 Downing Street and Queen Elizabeth II (Mirren). A large portion of the British population was trying to figure out the Windsors that week, as Elizabeth remained stiff-upper-lip and largely mum about the death of the beloved princess. In Peter Morgan's skillful script, we watch as Blair grows increasingly impatient with the Royals, who are sequestered in their Scottish estate while the public demands some show of grief. Prince Philip (James Cromwell, in good form) clumsily decides to take Diana's sons hunting, while a sympathetically-treated Prince Charles (Alex Jennings) displays some frustration with his mother's eerie calm.None of this conveys how funny the film is, or how deftly it flows from one scene to the next. Director Stephen Frears (Dirty Pretty Things) deserves great credit for that, and for the performances, and for the movie's marvelous sense of well-roundedness; you could see this movie and groan at the cluelessness of the Royals and their outmoded existence, or you might just sympathize with showing reserve in a world that values gross public displays of emotion. But either way, you'll marvel at Mirren, who makes the Queen far more alert and human than one might ever have imagined.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B003UESJH4", "B001C4AFOY", "B004M9QNVK", "B004GXKBDI", "B0059XTUVI", "B000Z8H0IC", "B000ZOXDFA", "B000RF7XYO", "B001L57ZZG", "B001TH92N4", "B000BKDNX0", "B0006Q93H4", "B000EOTELI", "B004XYOQU4", "B009TT0BSE", "B0012QE4Q2", "B001QUF3SW", "B007HW8U2Y", "B000EHQUGC", "B00342ANSA", "B004SIP9U6", "B000V02CNW", "B00005O7N8", "B00GM7STPI", "B003N9ASF2", "B002ZG99EK", "B004SIP71M", "B003Y5H4Y8", "B0001I55M4", "B001AZIRVI", "B00015HXDG", "B000E1NXJ0", "B000RF7XYY", "B00121QGPY", "B009AMANBA", "B000M06KJ8", "B000MEYJHY", "B00005JOFQ", "B007TBJUVI", "B0085A9JXG", "B003AND1SM", "B000NIVJF4", "B0010X73Z6", "B000K7VHQE", "B00005JKNF", "B000MCH5P4", "B001TR4G6W", "B004P7CNZO", "B0050PYNN0", "B000GH3CR0", "B00AEFY8MM", "B0068MNO4S", "B002RSDW80", "B001MVWFAO", "B004ZNFTDQ", "B000255LIY", "B000V6LSOA", "B00ARX2VZW", "B000G6BM0K", "B008220C38"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003UESJH4", "B004M9QNVK", "B001C4AFOY", "B004GXKBDI"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "asin": "B00005JPAM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51K34G0GCBL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Queen"}

{"description": "Nearly 20 years after riding his last Crusade, Harrison Ford makes a welcome return as archaeologist/relic hunter Indiana Jones inIndiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, an action-packed fourth installment that's, in a nutshell, less memorable than the first three but great nostalgia for fans of the series. Producer George Lucas and screenwriter David Koepp (War of the Worlds) set the film during the cold war, as the Soviets--replacing Nazis as Indy's villains of choice and led by a sword-wielding Cate Blanchett with black bob and sunglasses--are in pursuit of a crystal skull, which has mystical powers related to a city of gold. After escaping from them in a spectacular opening action sequence, Indy is coerced to head to Peru at the behest of a young greaser (Shia LaBeouf) whose friend--and Indy's colleague--Professor Oxley (John Hurt) has been captured for his knowledge of the skull's whereabouts. Whatever secrets the skull holds are tertiary; its reveal is the weakest part of the movie, as the CGI effects that inevitably accompany it feel jarring next to the boulder-rolling world of Indy audiences knew and loved. There's plenty of comedy, delightful stunts--ants play a deadly role here--and the return ofRaiderslove interest Karen Allen as Marion Ravenwood, once shrill but now softened, giving her ex-love bemused glances and eye-rolls as he huffs his way to save the day. Which brings us to Ford: bullwhip still in hand, he's a little creakier, a lot grayer, but still twice the action hero of anyone in film today. With all the anticipation and hype leading up to the film's release, perhaps no reunion is sweeter than that of Ford with the role that fits him as snugly as that fedora hat.--Ellen A.

{"description": "Alas! The fifthHarry Potterfilm has arrived. The time is long past that this can be considered a simple \"children's\" series--though children and adults alike will enjoy it immensely. Starting off from the dark and tragic ending of the fourth film,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenixbegins in a somber and angst-filled tone that carries through the entire 138 minutes (the shortest of anyHPmovie despite being adapted from the longest book). Hopes of winning the Quidditch Cup have been replaced by woes like government corruption, distorted media spin, and the casualties of war. As the themes have matured, so have the primary characters' acting abilities. Ron (Rupert Grint), Hermione (Emma Watson), and especially Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) are more convincing than ever--in roles that are more demanding.Harry is deeply traumatized from having witnessed Cedric Diggory's murder, but he will soon find that this was just another chapter in the continuing loss he will endure. Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) has returned and, in an attempt to conceal this catastrophe from the wizarding public, the Ministry of Magic has teamed up with the wizard newspaperThe Daily Prophetto smear young Potter and wise Dumbledore (Michael Gambon)--seemingly the only two people in the public eye who believe the Dark Lord has returned. With no one else to stand against the wicked Death Eaters, the Hogwarts headmaster is forced to revive his secret anti-Voldemort society, the Order of the Phoenix. This welcomes back characters like Mad-Eye Moody (Brendan Gleeson), kind Remus Lupin (David Thewlis), fatherly Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), and insidious Severus Snape (Alan Rickman), and introduces a short list of intriguing new faces. In the meantime, a semi-psychotic bureaucrat from the Ministry (brilliantly portrayed by Imelda Staunton) has seized power at Hogwarts, and Harry is forced to form a secret society of his own--lest the other young wizards at his school be left ill-equipped to defend themselves in the looming war between good and evil. In addition, Harry is filled with an inexplicable rage that only his Godfather Sirius seems to be able to understand.This film, though not as frightening as its predecessor, earns its PG-13 rating mostly because of the ever-darkening tone.  As always, the loyal fans of J.K. Rowling's books will suffer huge cuts from the original plot and character developments, but make no mistake: this is agoodmovie.--Jordan ThompsonOn the DVDThe second disc ofThe Order of the Phoenixfeatures \"The Hidden Secrets of Harry Potter,\" a retrospective on the series so far, with \"Potter experts\" (i.e., people who run fan sites) weighing in on what's to come. This must have been filmed during production, because all their speculation about the conclusion of the saga is clearly dated and therefore superfluous (sinceOrderreleased theatrically at the same time as the seventh book, one would've expected a more current analysis). Many of the deleted scenes are mostly extensions, with the exception of one hilarious take of Professor Trelawney (Emma Thompson) trying--unsuccessfully--to eat gracefully during Dolores Umbridge's introduction at Hogwarts. The chatty actress Natalia Tena, who plays Tonks, gives a tour of the set in \"Trailing Tonks,\" even playing a Christmas song she wrote on her guitar, and director David Yates and editor Mark Day demonstrate editing 101 with a feature that lets you edit your own scene from the movie. Watch the feature but skip the self-editing part; the controls are too complicated to navigate and too frustrating to work properly (plus, hit the wrong button and you've gone all the way back to the beginning). A digital copy of the movie is also included on the bonus disc.--Ellen A.

{"description": "Marriage is a huge step in any relationship and, with the divorce rate skyrocketing, some clergymen find it advisable to council prospective couples prior to the marriage ceremony. Reverend Frank (Robin Williams) takes his marriage preparation course to a whole new level, putting couples through a very unusual and grueling set of classes that cover everything from trust and communication to experiencing childbirth, meeting each other's needs in and out of bed, and group sessions on how to fight fairly. Happy couple Sadie Jones's (Mandy Moore) and Ben Murphy's (John Krasinski) perfect compatibility is tested to the limits with extraordinary (and hysterical) assignments like caring for twin baby robots that cry and poop without restraint while baby-sitting a friend's two young children and shopping for wedding china. Driving a car blindfolded while one's intended gives directions is no simple task either, but abstinence from sex and writing their own marriage vows may be the couple's most difficult homework assignments. Comedy reigns throughout the entire movie thanks to Robin Williams, his choir-boy assistant Josh Flitter (Nancy Drew) and the rest of the cast and laughing out loud is definitely a course requirement for viewers, but underneath the hilarity is a serious message about making marriage work.--Tami HoriuchiDVD featuresIncludes widescreen anamorphic and full-screen versionsAdditional scenes with optional director commentaryAsk Choir Boy: Choose which relationship/marital questions he answers", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00561BNI6", "B000OCZA04", "B000P0J08S", "B00104AYFQ", "B0000CDRVU", "B001TUZD8O", "B00005JN3W", "B000A343RI", "B00008WJD6", "B0015I2RT8", "B0034GK78W", "B002ZG989G", "B00003CXSM", "B001AKTZW8", "B003B3V0N4", "6304584210", "B004EPZ070", "B001BL96JI", "B00AEBB8NS", "B001OQCUZM", "B002ZG9968", "B000LC5B7O", "B00005JPSM", "B000Y7U93C", "B00005JG6N", "B001Y8DJVE", "B008R65XWO", "B003EYVXXC", "B000BKVQS4", "B0009OL7Z4", "B00AEBB9M8", "B000ELJAEM", "B002K0WBXW", "B000ICM5X0", "B000GB775E", "B000RETOGA", "B00005JN4H", "B00006FMUW", "B00386EZKE", "B002ZG97QK", "B00AEFY99O", "B0049TC88U", "B003Y5H524", "B0000DZ6N3", "B000MEYJHE", "B0021L8UOY", "B000E6EHE0", "B0038N9X3Q", "B00007976U", "B00AEFXWXI", "B00008VFCA", "B00005JN0Z", "B0038N9WKU", "B002SYAGNC", "B00007E2F5", "B00DMDE02Q", "B002ZG984Q", "B0015U0QVW", "B0012KJ0DK", "B004IK30PA", "B000YAA68C", "B0002OXRSG", "B002ZG97B0", "B0002I84N0", "B0007RT9M6", "B004SIP9X8", "B000099T4E", "B00006ZXSL", "B001CTA1UM", "B001C5LLQ4", "B000HCPS94", "B00164KYV4", "B000P0J0DS", "B004SIP7I0", "B00005JMXX", "B002ZG998G", "B0000897EG", "B000J4QW7W", "B00466HN7M", "B00AEBB8R4", "B003Y5H4ZW", "B002ZG98FU", "B005LAIIB2", "B000957O82", "B003UEYBPI", "B000EMGICS", "B00AEFYWQY", "B00029LO5E", "B002ZGW92E", "B0026BXHQ0", "B000VKL6T8", "B00HW3EZZE", "B005LAIGSM", "B000LC4Z8A", "B0010X5X4O", "B002ZG99UE", "B000E8N8H0", "B002U4UYZA", "B001HN69C2", "B004HO6I2E"], "bought_together": ["B000OCZA04"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0034GK78W", "B002ZG989G", "B00561BNI6", "B001Y8DJVE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 56082}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.99, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00005JPQE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51-wgdGowCL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "License to Wed"}

{"description": "The Dark Knightarrives with tremendous hype (best superhero movie ever? posthumous Oscar for Heath Ledger?), and incredibly, it lives up to all of it.  But calling it the best superhero movie ever seems like faint praise, since part of what makes the movie great--in addition to pitch-perfect casting, outstanding writing, and a compelling vision--is that it bypasses the normal fantasy element of the superhero genre and makes it all terrifyingly real.  Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) is Gotham City's new district attorney, charged with cleaning up the crime rings that have paralyzed the city. He enters an uneasy alliance with the young police lieutenant, Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman), and Batman (Christian Bale), the caped vigilante who seems to trust only Gordon--and whom only Gordon seems to trust. They make progress until a psychotic and deadly new player enters the game: the Joker (Heath Ledger), who offers the crime bosses a solution--kill the Batman. Further complicating matters is that Dent is now dating Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal, after Katie Holmes turned down the chance to reprise her role), the longtime love of Batman's alter ego, Bruce Wayne.In his last completed role before his tragic death, Ledger is fantastic as the Joker, a volcanic, truly frightening force of evil. And he sets the tone of the movie: the world is a dark, dangerous place where there are no easy choices.  Eckhart and Oldman also shine, but as good as Bale is, his character turns out rather bland in comparison (not uncommon for heroes facing more colorful villains). Director-cowriter Christopher Nolan (Memento) follows his critically acclaimedBatman Beginswith an even better sequel that sets itself apart from notable superhero movies likeSpider-Man 2andIron Manbecause of its sheer emotional impact and striking sense of realism--there are no suspension-of-disbelief superpowers here. At 152 minutes, it's a shade too long, and it's much too intense for kids. But for most movie fans--and not just superhero fans--The Dark Knightis a film for the ages.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B00DUCXFUC", "B004LWZWGK", "B000PC6A3E", "B002ZG981E", "B00G4RD4PQ", "B0039208QM", "B001GMALGY", "B00E2Y0YBK", "B00C2IGQBA", "B0039208JE", "B00H14WTLQ", "B0039208CG", "B0085D3I3K", "B0039208C6", "B000M5AJQI", "B00319ECGK", "B001FB55H6", "B00EIG5M5A", "7020070078", "B00E2Y6AUY", "B00D5FMGGS", "B001OQCV6K", "B0013FBS20", "B000Q6GX5Y", "B001GKJ2FC", "B00FPS79F6", "B001992NUQ", "B004JMSIRC", "B001RIY4WE", "B00DYEN6XC", "B008QZ5PY2", "B001F7MSG6", "B00FAHYNWE", "B00J7PRJXU", "B001AQT0Z4", "B001UV4XEW", "B0083SBJXS", "B00AEFY552", "B00C8RD79O", "B007KAJG3K", "B007L4HET8", "B004EPZ07U", "B007L4HFDI", "B00AEFXKOO", "B000PC0U1W", "B00C6B8TB8", "B00HINFI4K", "B003TT2X6I", "B001KZIRM2", "B002ZG99NG", "B00EZ4M68G", "B004SIP90G", "B003ZHR6RK", "B001GCUO16", "B003TT2X6S", "B00JNEWSLS", "B001F3FUK6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00DUCXFUC", "B004LWZWGK", "B002ZG981E", "B000PC6A3E"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "asin": "B00005JPY0", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51pGxSkkz4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Dark Knight [Theatrical Release]"}

{"description": "America's first family of dysfunction, the Simpsons, appear in all their depraved glory in this wonderful DVD compilation of their show's premiere season. Fans accustomed to the slick appearance of the later episodes will be delighted by the rougher nature of these earlier episodes, when the characters weren't as well defined (Homer isn't quite as dumb as he is in later seasons) and the animation was still evolving. This only adds to the charm of these 13 episodes, which begin with \"Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire,\" the December 1989 Christmas special in which a down-and-out Simpson family adopt Santa's Little Helper. Throughout the season, familiar faces are introduced, as we catch first glimpses of Smithers, Mr. Burns, the Flanderses, and Patty and Selma. Highlights of the season include \"The Crepes of Wrath,\" in which Bart is sent to France as an exchange student (\"Don't mess up France the way you messed up your room\"); \"Bart the Genius,\" in which Bart ends up in a school for the gifted; and \"Krusty Gets Busted,\" in which Bart's lifelong animosity with Sideshow Bob begins.--Jenny Brown", "related": {"also_bought": ["B007KFZ7UQ", "B007KFZ8AK", "B007KFZ8B4", "B007KFZ8AA", "B000067DNE", "B007KFZ7YM", "B007KFZ7Q0", "B007KFZ7PG", "B007KFZ87S", "B007KFZ88M", "B001GQ3GHG", "B0024FAR52", "B001L1S1PI", "B003KZ27N0", "B005QIOJ3A", "B000WGYMD8", "B000WGYMGK", "B000BQPC42", "B009DW5YJI", "B00F4NPBI4", "B00023P49C", "B0012KSUTA", "B00009N80Z", "B000E6ES9O", "B002R8JE7S", "B000083C6V", "B009DW5X0I", "B008412UKA", "B003KZ27NA", "B005QIOJ6M", "B00L89VL96", "B000NNK4DM", "B00F4NPBAC", "B00008YGRV", "B00005JM3G", "B000B5XOWU", "B00008YGRS", "B00JDFTN60", "B0006Z2L2Y", "B0002PYS60", "B0000CABL2", "0062267752", "B007ZFR67I", "B00023P49M", "B002DKGWSE", "B000HT3P6U", "B0072BNKHA", "B0077ATSSQ", "B001E6HUXO", "B00AIANIPQ", "B001MVWRNE", "B001VFM0ZG", "B00JNB80YU", "B00HX14C7Q", "B000ADWCYY", "B0006Q93CO", "B00008EY6Q", "B008JFUO0Y", "1612185916", "B0000C2IQB", "B006W93ELK", "B005LAIHY0", "B00HN9D22Y", "B00JO5LJG6", "B001FB55HQ", "B001VLBDD0", "B009SQ9Q5M", "B00C7E3E7S", "B001AQO3QA", "B0024FAD9W", "B002N5N5SO", "B000EQHXOG", "B009LDD40U", "B001CK1D44", "B003Y5H5EW", "B0014Z4OMU", "B00I099K4U", "B003L77GDS", "B00JHH1VUU", "0785154620", "B00BUWD7Y8", "B000ELJAEM", "B005LAIIMG", "B002FOQXTQ", "B008MCKL5W", "B00IMIGWD6", "B00DQC2FPM", "B0087ZG7HK", "B00GZ0ML4C", "B00AO686MY", "B001QIVEVE", "B00005JG6M", "B0001I561E", "0385352107", "B00I0VTPWA"], "bought_together": ["B007KFZ7UQ", "B007KFZ8AK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B007KFZ7UQ", "B007KFZ8AA", "B007KFZ7YM", "B00F4NPBI4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 70952}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 23.24, "brand": "TCFHE", "asin": "B00005ML6Y", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51P2P9TQYCL._SX300_.jpg", "title": "The Simpsons: The Complete First Season"}

{"description": "LikeCarriebefore it,Ginger Snapsuses horror-movie conventions as an inspired metaphor for puberty. When beautiful but reclusive goth teenager Ginger (Katharine Isabelle) is attacked by a monstrous wolf on the eve of her first period, her body starts changing in a big way, as do her suddenly lusty, feral appetites. Director John Fawcett masterfully balances the expectations of teen horror exploitation (blood, bodies, sex, smart dialogue, and good old-fashioned monster-movie scares) with clever black humor and tender sisterly solidarity. Only devoted sister Brigitte (gloomy Emily Perkins) knows the truth, and even as Ginger's abrupt transformation threatens their once unbreakable friendship, bonds of blood and love keep them together: Brigitte disposes of Ginger's victims while searching for a cure. Mimi Rogers costars as their dotty but unexpectedly sensitive mom, ready to sacrifice all to protect her daughter.

{"description": "Innocuous, innocent, and somewhat idiotic, Disney's bubbleheaded road-movie comedy plays as a farcical remake of the 1976 cult TV-movie melodramaThe Boy in the Plastic Bubble. Jake Gyllenhaal is the goodhearted innocent raised in a sort of human Habitrail of plastic rooms and rubber tunnels. To win back the girl of his dreams (Marley Shelton), he steps out of his indoor greenhouse and into a homemade Ziplock bubble suit. It's the usual story: naive innocent bounces down the highway like a beach ball with legs and wins over the wacky supporting cast of soft-hearted bikers, zombielike teenage cultists, and orphaned \"freaks\" through purity and pluck. The premise wears thin after a while, but Gyllenhaal keeps the film bounding along with goofy innocence and energetic eagerness. Swoosie Kurtz costars as his religious-zealot clinging mom. Watch for Fabio in an inspired cameo.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00003CXPS", "6305433925", "B00005V9HR", "B00AEFXPG2", "B00005JKJJ", "B00005YUPD", "B0045HCJRG", "B00008L3W3", "B000CEPE5A", "B00102F5WK", "B0000797IO", "6305428549", "B00005JLOB", "B00006JU8B", "B00003CXIS", "B00441GYVA", "B004SUDQ22", "630529142X", "B001R23GBU", "B001FB55L2", "B001ECDVKE", "B000VXWX7E", "B00LBHOCHS", "B00DW5IL92", "B004L3AR0K", "B0000AC8LR", "B000089778", "B00008K7AM", "B00BLN4UPG", "B00BTYNXJG", "B000069HQ2", "B00003CXS7", "B00005RYLX", "B000EMGJAO", "B00005JOFQ", "B000DZIGDU", "B0023TCWE8", "B004GJYRA0", "B00AEFXIUK", "B00005JH9O", "B00AEFZE48", "B000FP2OPO", "B000031EFY", "0783227345", "B0006FYOTC", "B00BLN4V0A", "B000QUU4MS", "B002NZK5U0", "B0007KIFXW", "0783226896", "B0009ZE9VW", "B0006HBZE2", "B000089773", "0783230494", "B000ELJAEM", "B00AEFYPXY", "B000A0GP0Y", "B00007JMEB", "B004XQO90O", "B002XUBDRY", "0780625528", "B00E1HIX66", "B0016MJ6GA", "B0006GANPA", "B000WZEZGI", "B0015RRNN4", "B00000F0AD", "6305870179", "B001G5T6GW", "B00005PJ6N", "B003UYUQZW", "B00005JMX6", "B00003CXK7", "B00000K3U4", "B000EGDBZ6", "B00008979O", "B000MNOXYY", "B001GC9VK6", "B00005JM4Q", "B00005NGAY", "B00AEBB9GY", "B000BUE5E6", "B00AEBB89W", "B000QUU7L6", "B00008L3U1", "0792840127", "1558908404", "B00005QT9P", "B00AG4714S", "B000089771", "B004SIP7K8", "B00005PJ6M", "B00006ADFT", "B008220CQU", "B00049QQHI", "B004P7CN5O", "B0050PYNP8", "B002GHHHL0", "B004HO6I2E", "0790751445"], "bought_together": ["6305433925", "B0045HCJRG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00003CXPS", "B000CEPE5A", "6305433925", "B0045HCJRG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 22273}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.5, "brand": "DISNEY", "asin": "B00005U8QN", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51B5N45K6VL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Bubble Boy"}

{"description": "A.D. Policebegan as a three-part OAV prequel to the popularBubblegum Crisisseries; these 12 episodes constitute the entire 1999 remake for TV. In the not-too-distant future, a massive earthquake has reduced Tokyo to rubble. The metropolis has been rebuilt as Genom City, named after the gargantuan conglomerate that manufacturesVoomers(VOodoo Organic Metal Extension Resource), robots that provide most of the labor in the city. When a robot turns into a violent rogueBoomer, the A.D. Police has to resolve the crisis--by shooting the Boomer in its vital core. The most effective cop on the squad is Kenji Sasaki, but he's a coolly arrogant loner who operates on his own terms, rather than a team player. When his partner is critically injured in a fight with Boomers, Kenji is paired with the mysterious Hans Kleif, and the duo slowly forges a friendship. Kenji, Hans, and the rest of the squad are pitted against Liam Fletcher, the right-hand henchman of the Genom Corporation president, in a series of violent confrontations. This incarnation ofA.D. Policefeels like a standard-issue anime action-adventure series: it pits a tough, motorcycle-riding antihero against an all-powerful industrial conglomerate involved in illegal and unethical biomechanical experiments. The mecha designs are undistinguished, and nothing in the scripts, animation, or direction sets the program apart. Liam's violent attempts at hijacking a plane and a nuclear reactor may disturb some viewers.

{"description": "These brief (30 minutes total), silly adventures use a few elements of Lewis Carroll's \"Alice\" stories as a premise. The title character has been transformed into a blond teenager in a sailor suit; all the other characters have been recast as curvaceous women in scanty costumes. The White Rabbit is a Playboy bunny, years after the last Playboy Club closed. The Cheshire Cat attempts to seduce Miyuki; the Queen of Hearts (who wears a dominatrix costume) cracks a whip and tries to make Miyuki kiss her boots. Of course, it's all a dream, but not a pleasant one. Western viewers may have trouble understanding why the all-female Clamp studio would make such a sophomoric example of fan-service sexism. Perhaps the material plays differently in Japan, but it's difficult to see how. Unrated; suitable for ages 17 and up: Brief nudity, violence, sexual situations, including lesbianism and sado-masochism.--Charles Solomon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00GRZPQR4", "B00CENSU3A", "B00GJ7CTSE", "B00ANDPGI0", "B005NQ5LM8", "B008YRL6V8", "B00E688XI8", "B001PSUM04", "1626920311", "B000R17RT4", "B001EL6E9U", "B00ANDBWXS", "B00ANDEL3Q", "B003UNG8H8", "B009RZ890M", "B00576U9LM", "B00ANDGYO0", "B009L0H4H2", "B00ANDPGFI", "B004SGWYW4", "159182303X", "1935934899", "B0048EAYQE", "B00CU6WBMW", "B000JJ4FA8", "1937867099", "B0006IIPNA", "B00008V2V3", "B00005CC78", "B00004Y9PV", "B00004T3BS", "B0030BOCFK", "B0000A1HOO", "B000087F31", "B0000ACP48", "B000056MW6", "B0000A9GLV", "B00006CY49", "B0032DA43U", "B00009MGFN", "B003TX8Q24", "B0000C3IBR", "B00B04KVOA", "B0014LXES4", "B00005O5AR", "B0002LE8XW", "B00151QYIA", "B0000844I7", "B001EL6EB8", "B00006JDSW", "B0000DZ3GU", "B00AIZ20SW", "B002MD2YWU", "B002FOQY36", "B000VKL6RU", "B002CWKTQE", "B007V2LN74"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0036EBALK", "B00B1LM758", "159182303X", "B0085A9JGI"]}, "price": 9.66, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 144857}, "asin": "B0000639E5", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51R9Y5HTHCL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Miyuki-Chan in Wonderland"}
{"description": "Fans of Denise Richards will delight in her skin-tight and belly-revealing  outfits inGood Advice; fans of Charlie Sheen will enjoy his  patented sleazeball-with-a-heart-of-gold performance. Richards is the  author of a much-ignored advice column who's trying to drag her hotshot  stockbroker boyfriend (Sheen) to the altar. When a phony tip ruins Sheen's  career, Richards leaves for Brazil with the owner of a diamond mine. When  the publisher of the newspaper that runs the advice column calls, Sheen  grabs at the chance for a paycheck and writes for Richards.  Unsurprisingly, masquerading as a woman saves his shallow male soul and  his witty but insightful comments turn the column into a big hit. All  seems to be going well until Richards suddenly returns and finds herself  famous. Angie Harmon plays the publisher with whom--unsurprisingly--sparks  fly. Jon Lovitz, Rosanna Arquette, and Estelle Harris provide helpful  support.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B006GL8NGU", "B00KHA9BQ2", "B000ENUYGS", "B000H5TH0M", "B00JHH1VUU", "B00009QG6G", "B0009X75MO", "B003M05KU0", "B00555ZTHO", "6305213283", "0790732149", "B001NY4WYC", "B000XJ5UFS", "B00007AJE1", "B00FRILRL6", "B00CAYH23M", "B00EIXWMII", "B007K7IAVC", "B00AEBB9WI", "B003VA3JZO", "B002XTXGCK", "B009INAK8C", "B003R4ZMPE", "B00005JPSM", "B002NZK5UU", "B00D6I7GHS", "B00AEFXEGS", "B00AEFY4TO", "B00013D59E", "B00ANV82HE", "B009TE9784", "B000K405CY", "6305428395", "B00005V5NS", "B00006ZXSO", "B00466H37M", "B0002DRDY6", "B001L2ZSFS", "B00B9UEOPC", "B0009VRHM4", "B00E1HIWXU", "B00AEFXZ76", "B003AWRMA6", "B00006G8JD", "B0001GF2D8", "B00BTYFWEA", "B0045HCJIK", "B000FOPPDI", "B005NKIPUY", "B006JIL1FK", "B0001NBLZ4", "B00AEBB9DW", "B00005U5AG", "B004UXVDOA", "B004NWOC1E", "B000ICM5X0", "B00000G3MI", "B000A3XYIM", "B0014BQR7Y", "B00AEFYW64", "B000957O82", "B001Q8MMD8", "B0000897EI", "B003AWRMC4", "B0000ZMGWK", "B00003CXUP", "B0037XPPAM", "B000Z27H8Q", "B000NTMA1U", "B002P413IW", "B00466H37W", "B008Y1YK9E", "B003L77G7E", "B00008G7UF", "6305308837", "B00006JDVT", "B000059TG7", "B001BEK8G0", "B000EHSVSW", "B0007KZQAM", "B00024JC30", "B000EZ9084", "B000NJMJIY", "B0006J27WO", "B0009X75PQ", "B00005LOL4", "B002FU8IWU", "B000F3UAFC", "B00BLN4UPG", "0780620887", "B001TKNWV4", "B0045HCJ8K", "6305236569", "B000UAE7J0", "B004SIP8LG", "B0001FVDH8", "B00003CXNJ", "B00803PFXQ", "B003L20ICE"], "bought_together": ["B006GL8NGU"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000099T4E", "B0009X75MO", "B000H5TH0M", "B006GL8NGU"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 54352}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.75, "brand": "LION&#39;S GATE ENTERTAINMENT", "asin": "B0000640RV", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51MM8JG0EML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Good Advice"}

{"description": "Musically, this is an exemplaryMacbeth. Visually, it is a matter  of personal taste, but director David Pountney, who has a flair for  unconventional staging (see, for example, hisRusalka) gives it a strong,  concentrated visual impact with overtones that send the mind spinning in many  directions. The chorus of witches, which is seen right at the beginning and  later at intervals, has a wild variety of costumes and makeup and might be  mistaken for the inhabitants of an old-fashioned insane asylum. The power of  superstition (or perhaps of the supernatural) is one of this opera's primary  subtexts, and it's presented with eerie impact, including a mummified corpse  that refuses to lie still. Costumes are generally but not exclusively modern.Thomas Hampson and Paoletta Marrocu score equally well as singers and actors,  and neither tries to prettify the character. They are ably supported, most  notably by Roberto Scanduzzi (who manages to look spooky as Banquo's ghost with  a jacket and necktie) and Luis Lima, a fire-breathing Macduff.

{"description": "To the ranks of shows too brilliant and outrageous for prime time (The Ben Stiller Show,Andy Richter Controls the Universe), add Seth McFarlane'sFamily Guy. This animated series, which debuted after the 1999 Super Bowl, simply sparked too much controversy and offended too many sensibilities to survive (Entertainment Weeklydubbed it \"the Awful Show They Just Keep Putting on the Air\"). That the Fox network also played hackysack with its schedule, ensuring viewers would not be able to find it, sealed its fate (it was cancelled in 2002). This boxed set containing all 28 episodes from the first two seasons is payback for the show's devoted cult following, who may be moved to echo the words of infant Stewie Griffin, the megalomaniacal 1-year-old bent on matricide and world domination: \"Victory is mine!\"The dysfunctional Griffins of Quahog, Rhode Island, invite comparisons toThe Simpsons. The testicular-chinned father, Peter Griffin, is a clueless oaf in the Homer mold. \"Peter, what did you promise me last night?\" asks his long-suffering wife Lois in one episode. \"That I wouldn't drink at the stag party,\" he replies. \"And what did you do?\" she asks. \"Drank at the stag part--oh ho ho, I almost walked into that one,\" he cackles. Other family members include teenage daughter Meg, a desperate high school social pariah; 13-year-old son Chris, a chip off his father's blockhead; and Brian, the family's sarcastic talking dog. But this series' true inspiration is football-pated Stewie (voiced by McFarlane, who earned an Emmy), who was born to be a Bond villain once he escaped his mother's \"ovarian bastille.\"Family Guyrecklessly ventured whereThe Simpsonsfeared to tread. In one episode, Meg's one and only friend turns out to be the member of a suicidal cult. In another, Death (voiced by Norm McDonald) becomes an unwanted houseguest. Each episode plays fast and furious with surreal flashes (in one episode, Peter turns his house into a puppet) and pop-culture references and TV, movie, and commercial parodies that invite repeated viewings. Freed from its own family-hour bastille and the whims of dim network executives,Family Guycan be appreciated at last on its own profane, sacrilegious, and irreverent terms. Welcome to the DVD family, Griffins.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00008YGRV", "B000AQ68Z0", "B000HT3P6U", "B000RO6JZO", "B0012018OE", "B001VFM0ZG", "B003DZX46G", "B003L77G9W", "B0058YPMHO", "B00E0FW054", "B000E6ES9O", "B000A3DFV8", "B00FR81Z40", "B003V3FVQ6", "B000NNK4DM", "B0006B41GM", "B0040JHX0W", "B0012KSUTA", "B001N9VW5Y", "B001RIZ7OI", "B003X4KHRG", "B002LARYTW", "B002JVWQYG", "B00023P49C", "B003CN5B7E", "B000YOX3HE", "B008412UKA", "B0053O8A32", "B0058RN7KA", "B003L77G7Y", "B00023P49M", "B007KFZ85K", "B000E0OE3K", "B00008YGRS", "B0000CABL2", "B00LFW6BA0", "B00BYNL8DU", "B0001ZWLVU", "B008412UQ4", "B004696M94", "B007KFZ7UQ", "B005QIOJUI", "B0044E9JTG", "B007KFZ88M", "B000RW3VDE", "B009SQ9Q5M", "B00A2JFNSS", "B0018RKEQE", "B007KFZ7PG", "B000067DNE", "B007KFZ7YM", "B007KFZ8AK", "B001L1S1PS", "B0001MZ7KA", "B000CNESM6", "B002LASCJ8", "B007KFZ87S", "B007KFZ7Q0", "B0002WZRSG", "B004MLEYTG", "B0006Z2L2Y", "B007KFZ8AA", "B00005JM3G", "B008OTH56Q", "B000ADWCYY", "B007ZFR67I", "B000B5XOR0", "B000FSME2Y", "B0044E9JSW", "B000FEBWTE", "B000B5XOWU", "B0000C2IQB", "B008AITJ7O", "B00000F5W8", "B007KFZ8B4", "B00005JOHC", "B005CGI4EG", "B0086UVMEE", "B000W91RUG", "B0024FAR6Q", "B000ERVJNG", "B003L77G6U", "B0060OKO2O", "B00BUWD7Y8", "B006W93ELK", "B001O0TWXG", "B003KZ27N0", "B00775R45A", "B000GPIPTM", "B002N5N4FS", "B0030Y11UG", "B000GETTKM", "B00HDU9UOW", "B002C11LCG", "B0000AQS81", "B00AIANIPQ", "B000KLQUMQ", "B000TM1CKQ", "B004XVMCH6", "B004MLEYUK"], "bought_together": ["B00008YGRV", "B000AQ68Z0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00008YGRV", "B00E0FW054", "B000HT3P6U", "B003L77G9W"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 28363}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 11.89, "brand": "20th Century Fox", "asin": "B000083C6V", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51N2CR5F9CL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Family Guy, Volume One"}

{"description": "With breathtaking verisimilitude,Bloody Sundayposits an  immediate, you-are-there re-creation of Ireland's most controversial  contemporary tragedy. From dusk to dawn, the events of January 30, 1972, are  presented in convincingverit&#xE9;fashion; by employing rapid fade-to-black  transitions, director Paul Greengrass approaches two perspectives with equal  anticipation of potential disaster, based on facts as reported in Don Mullan's  politically influential bookEyewitness Bloody Sunday. Ivan  Cooper (James Nesbitt) is, ironically, a Protestant Member of Parliament,  leading a peaceful but tensely expectant civil rights march through the Catholic  \"bogside\" of the city of Derry, in protest of the British practice of internment  without trial. He watches in horror as his throng of unarmed protesters  splinters against British paramilitaries who impulsively open fire. No question  where Greengrass's sympathies lie (heard but not seen, the first shots are  British), but despite charges of inaccuracy and bias,Bloody Sundaywill  likely stand as the definitive cinematic representation of that horrible day  when deadly confusion reigned supreme.

{"description": "The fourth series ofDeep Space Ninecan be summed up in one word: Klingons! The show's producers apparently felt beset from all sides.Babylon 5was a huge hit, as wasStar Trek: Voyager, the flagship of new channel UPN. Stepping upDS9's action quotient seemed to be the answer. Time would tell, however, whether doing so viaTrek's tried-and-tested former bad guys was the best solution. Opening with a special two-hour extravaganza, the new year was immediately unfamiliar. Dennis McCarthy's original theme--despite winning an Emmy--had been deemed too subdued. As its upbeat new rendition kicked off, the station was seen in battle and swarming with activity. Moments later, we met old/new crewmember Worf, whose sudden appearance was the result of a brewing invasive strategy by the Klingons. This initiated the first of many loyalty shifts, as the Cardassians became the victims. With plenty of re-appearances by Gowron, Kor, and Kurn, it was clear that an ongoing space opera was being crafted. Dukat revealed a tragedy-ridden daughter; Odo's relationship with his people (and Kira) became increasingly melancholy; and even the Jem'Hadar foot soldiers were given a sympathetic angle by their drug addiction.Adding to the layers of ambiguity about Earth's (read: the producers') position over being at war, was the \"outing\" of two recurring characters as rebel activists. Lest we forget the homely/spiritual side of the Captain, time was spent with a future version of Jake, with his father (Brock Peters), and on the nature of his role as \"the Emissary.\" Avery Brooks worked behind the camera a couple of times, but this year the surprise was LeVar Burton directing five shows. There was still time for comedy: the Ferengi warped back to Roswell in 1947 and Bashir played James Bond. But the year will be remembered predominately for its violence. One of the episodes Burton directed had its fight scenes drastically cut, while the series as a whole won an Emmy for its space battle effects.--Paul Tonks", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00008KA59", "B00008KA5A", "B00008KA58", "B00008KA57", "B00008972H", "B00005JLF5", "B0002JP4GE", "B0002WZTCA", "B000228EBS", "B00062IDCO", "B00062IDLA", "B0001NBNFW", "B000127LW2", "B000A6CLL0", "B0009I7NGW", "B000AOEMXC", "B0007TKH66", "B00BHWG0DQ", "B00BHWG0CM", "B000063V8T", "B000063V8S", "B000063V8R", "B000062XFG", "B00005Y1NF", "B00062IDDS", "B00K2CHWYI", "B00KHA9BQ2", "B004EXWGHY", "B002BAW6H2", "B002BAW6FE", "B00L4K3MLE", "B002BAW6FY", "B002BAW6GS", "B001DHXT3Y", "B00IURL19Y", "B000VDDDY6", "B00IWTVDUW", "0671501062", "B002BAW6GI", "B0017VG69U", "B00AZMFJYA", "B00HETWFVC", "B00BHWG0G8", "B003Y7JWZ0", "B001RHGRTS", "B00IUR3YI0", "B0041B77RS", "B000BOH990", "B00BHWG1AI", "B000HEWEJ4", "B000CNE0SS", "B001EHF3RS", "B000B8IA2G", "B002I9Z8GM", "B00ENFS0F0", "B00CKYHH6O", "B000AOEMXM", "B00453QOC6", "B002GP7ZW8", "B000BT96EG", "B000BNI90Y", "B002I9Z8I0", "B00077BPF0", "6305761078", "B00B7VZN76", "B00GX7D5G0", "B00BD6K54G", "B00GTZWZH6", "B00HRUQAKU", "B000LC4ZI0", "B00BHLTIXQ", "B000CNE0T2", "B000W4KT9G", "B000SNUR34", "B0042YZFYG", "B00009VTZX", "B000BOH98G", "B000UX6TKC", "B006LPHY6G", "B0095XPZBC", "B000I0QLRI", "B008D1Q1XI", "B001DF681G", "B00CDEJRDC", "B008R52LA2", "B002I9Z8GW", "B000I0QLS2", "B0024FAD7Y", "B007AFC0W4", "B0000CABIJ", "B002GP7ZVO", "B000I0QLRS", "B000EXDS34", "B001TH16DS", "6303961614", "B002HRF68A", "B00466H3A4", "B000RZIGVS", "B001C71IGU"], "bought_together": ["B00008KA59", "B00008KA5A"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00008KA59", "B00008KA5A", "B00008972H", "B00005JLF5"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 27750}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 34.4, "brand": "Paramount Home Video", "asin": "B00008KGT0", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51D4ZZXYN9L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Star Trek Deep Space Nine - The Complete Fourth Season"}
{"description": "For its brief and shining moment--12 aired episodes, to be exact--The Ben Stiller Show, which aired on Fox in 1992, recaptured the anarchic spirit and subversively funny voice of first-seasonSaturday Night LiveandSCTV. More too-hip-for-the-room than ahead of its time, the show suffered dismal ratings and was unceremoniously cancelled. It then went on to win an Emmy for best writing and attract a fervent following, enhanced by the fact that the series has seldom been syndicated. This long-awaited DVD release fills not a void, but an abyss. To watch Stiller, Janeane Garofalo, Andy Dick, and a pre-Mr. ShowBob Odenkirk at the dawn of their mostly unconventional careers, romp in the show's opening is akin to watching the Beatles frolic on that football field inA Hard Day's Night. Stiller and company's pitch-perfect and intimately observed skewering of movies, television, and show business convention could be exhilarating, as witness \"Woody Allen's Bride of Frankenstein\" (you'll never watch another Allen film with a straight face again), \"Cape Munster,\" with Stiller as a psychopathic and vengeful Eddie Munster, \"Skank,\" a potent comment on the crass programming that was initially Fox's stock in trade, and even brilliant riffs on the seminal reality seriesCops, which re-imagine the series in witch-hysteric Salem, Massachussetts, ancient Egypt, and medieval times.In addition to the cast's uncanny impersonations (Stiller's Bono, Tom Cruise, Bruce Springsteen, Daniel Day-Lewis, and Bruce Willis, and Garofalo's Juliette Lewis),The Ben Stiller Showwas home to a gallery of recurring characters--agent Michael Pheret, the No, No, No Guy--who, thankfully,SNLproducer Lorne Michaels was not around to parlay into godawful films. The topical humor can't help but date some of the material (the show is a veritable Trivial Pursuit of pop culture references, fromThe Partridge FamilytoBeverly Hills 90210, but the brilliance of the writing and sheer abandon of the performances are still a joy to behold.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000CQQID0", "B001LRL4XI", "B00274SITW", "B000RZGHT6", "B00005Y3ZL", "B0002ERXBS", "B000RZIGYA", "B001053088", "B00009W8JZ", "B007CU8P8K", "B00LBHOCHS", "1455526304", "B004J713KQ", "B0002KPHVU", "0971359784", "B0048LPRDC", "B000XUUQRO", "B0055CP9PO", "B00FXOO1AS", "B00008EY6Q", "B00L3ZB7JO", "1478980230", "B000MTFDB0", "B000M341RS", "B006KCZBK6", "B007VI658A", "B0089BSNVK", "B000068MBS", "B00IXPWGIS", "B003ES5JH4", "B00092ZM7U", "B0033WH6MW", "B004MA1K1M", "B0001KL5HQ", "B001J4E1C4", "B0008KLV96", "0989387801", "0306820307", "B002GSXKRO", "B000UX6TIY", "B00267N3EU", "B000HC2OBO", "B00009ZPU7", "B00CA4S3DU", "B004RCGQSC", "B005NHZAFK", "B000XJ5TOA", "B000FZETJS", "B00006AUIH", "B0035LCV12", "B000H7JCFK", "B0000TPA60", "B0002W4P98", "B0001S6AQE", "B0083XXWRE", "B00BM2JVAA", "B004HY3BU6", "B00AEBB9K0", "B000H5U6HK", "B0089BSMWA", "B004FGMZJY", "B000YI99IW", "B003IJ72WY", "B000TGJ8EE", "B0002PYTD2", "B0001EQHXO", "B00J8JQ8GY", "B0014FAIWU", "B00ID3TPDE", "B0006Q93CO", "B004U7MQW4", "B007UW9W32", "B00113YHXG", "B000ABKHZC", "B00008XRYS", "B000KF0DFM", "B00I0VTQSI", "B00H3LLC5Q", "B0096W4702", "B000FI8MPC", "B000H6SY1O", "B0018LX9VC", "B000EXDS7K", "B00000G02H", "B003NF97NU", "1416553657", "B005GRF3BS", "B000A9QKRI", "B005NHZB54", "B00009WVT3", "B001EYGOE2", "B002C3GTLC", "B004L9GLM2", "B0002NY8HQ", "B00D50D8D8", "B00C6QT4CQ", "B0000A1HPQ", "B000EWBNM8", "B00H91LW5K", "B000CSUNMK"], "bought_together": ["B000CQQID0", "B00274SITW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000CQQID0", "B000RZGHT6", "1455526304", "B000RZIGYA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 51668}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 7.6, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00008PHCU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510NKZTIx9L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Ben Stiller Show"}

{"description": "Matt Groening's second season of the 31st century sci-fi sitcomFuturamamaintained the high scripting standards of the first and also well brought improved digital animation. Couch potato Fry now seems thoroughly reconciled to his new existence, transported 10 centuries hence to \"New New York\" and working for Professor Farmsworth's delivery service. He's surrounded by a cast of freaks, including the bitchily cute Amy (with whom he has a romantic brush) and Hermes, the West Indian bureaucrat. Most sympathetic is the one-eyed Leela (voiced by Katey Segal). Like Lisa Simpson, she is brilliant but unappreciated; she finds solace in her pet Nibbler, a tiny creature with a voracious, carnivorous appetite. By contrast, Bender, the robot, is programmed with every human vice, a sort of metal Homer Simpson with a malevolent streak.In one of the best episodes, Bender is given a \"feelings\" chip in order to empathize with Leela after he flushes Nibbler down the toilet.

{"description": "The DVD release ofThree's Company's first season should be a cause for celebration for fans of the wildly popular sitcom; it arrives, however, just two months after the September 2003 death of star John Ritter, and so the DVD serves as a memorial to his comic talents as well as a long-awaited collectible. Launched on a six-episode trial run in the spring of 1977,Three's Company's first season immediately won over viewers with its racy scenario--a single man (Ritter) moves in with two single women (Joyce DeWitt and Suzanne Somers) and avoids the wrath of his landlords (Norman Fell and Audra Lindley) by pretending to be gay--and double entrendre-laden gags. Regardless of whether you think it was one of TV's funniest or most puerile series,Three's Companydid bring Ritter to deserved stardom and gave choice roles to veteran scene-stealers Fell and Lindley (later replaced by Don Knotts), and therefore deserves its place in television history. Anchor Bay's DVD includes unedited versions of all six episodes, as well as a featurette on Ritter.--Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0001O3YHQ", "B0002Y4T7O", "B0007WFXL2", "B0007WQHFS", "B000DZ95IU", "B000FA57U8", "B000H1RFXM", "B000JMKKMM", "B000CELOVI", "B000EQ45BU", "B0001Z3I1C", "B000NY0YJ0", "B00008R9MC", "B000CELOW2", "B000291Q3O", "B00GOC760U", "B000K7UBXE", "B0002JZT5U", "B00008EYBH", "B000068V9X", "B00IJZW35I", "B0002I837M", "B000G0O5JG", "B000M343AS", "B000NJMJHA", "B000EU1QC2", "B00GOC75YW", "B002E58FT2", "B00DXLO0D6", "B000OVLBH6", "B000068V9Y", "B00005JNIS", "B00D2UMHSI", "B00D2UMHB0", "B001DSNEME", "B00005JO4F", "B00008NV4G", "B0007OCG74", "B0002NY8R6", "B001993YB8", "B00GOC74OI", "B0009B16TO", "B0009JQN6M", "B0000ZMH92", "B0028SVY3Y", "B0007KTBJO", "B000EGDAO8", "B0009X7BEQ", "B0002W4SX6", "B0002DB5N6", "B000C6NPHC", "B000291Q3Y", "B0089BSLKS", "B0006Z2L4W", "B004DOTKCS", "B004WO9OMA", "B001DZOCVO", "B0050MB5AC", "B00DXLO0BI", "B00I099JYQ", "B00008EY6N", "B00I458456", "B000BF0C8E", "B000N2HD6O", "B00465I1D8", "B00DXLO086", "B0002O7Y8U", "B005CGI4EG", "B00BUWD7NE", "B000KGGIL4", "B00GLT2SOA", "B000EBGFQI", "B00IFK7ONI", "B000AJJNJK", "B0058J3S16", "B00007KK5I", "B000BGR1B4", "B001IXXYCE", "B002AMVEEM", "B005DCJ0Q0", "B002JH2EIS", "B00IFK7O5G", "B000C1VBAA", "B000R7I3YG", "B000EQ5PTQ", "B000F8O2MO", "B00BUWD7E8", "B00FWMVVJ0", "B001D2WUDE", "B008KZX7W0", "B00005JLEY", "B00005JOEB", "B000UX6TL6", "B0009H97HG", "B001J0FVYK", "B00008YLVB", "B0009I7NH6", "B000HEZEYG", "B000G1R3A8"], "bought_together": ["B0001O3YHQ", "B0002Y4T7O"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0007WFXL2", "B0002Y4T7O", "B0001O3YHQ", "B000DZ95IU"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 15912}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 6.71, "brand": "STARZ/SPHE", "asin": "B0000DFZ5O", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51T422GKFEL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Three's Company: Season 1"}

The first segment of the four-part, 54-minute documentary is mostly self-congratulation and plot summary (which is not necessarily a bad thing); more interesting are the creature effects and the actors learning how to do their own stunts.  If you were wondering if the voice of the Lycan Raze was really that deep, you can listen to him--actor/co-writer Kevin Grevioux--along with director Len Wiseman and co-writer Danny McBride on the first commentary track as they discuss breaking the rulebook for vampires and shooting in Budapest on a tiny $22 million budget.  The accent-heavy technical commentary discusses how the visual effects and sound design add to the film--one of their goals was to make Kate Beckinsale look \"sexy, stylish, and subversive.\"--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000F6IOC0", "B001HN697M", "B003Y5H5EW", "B0002KVUKM", "B0002J4X1Q", "0767834739", "B001JV5B12", "B000YPUF9W", "B002ZG98UA", "B009MO57H6", "0780624890", "B001AK3S4Y", "B001GUYB08", "B0007V6ITE", "B001F7MSFM", "B000F6IOBG", "B001GCUO0W", "B000FGGE68", "B005LAIHSG", "B0002YLCG0", "B0009MDPYM", "B000AYELVA", "0800195175", "B000069I1I", "B00005JKWJ", "B008OR5X4O", "B0000AXE8I", "B002GSXKNI", "B00005JKYX", "B004EPZ07K", "B005LAIH2C", "B003Y5H5F6", "B0000DKDUR", "B003HKN52U", "B002KX9CPO", "B005CFBZWK", "B00008AOVL", "B00IKM5LXG", "B001VLFE7Q", "B004LWZW42", "B001VLFE7G", "B0001BKAEY", "B005LAIH54", "B001QOGYFO", "B00005JL78", "B0000844I8", "B001PR0Y8K", "B005G4TJUC", "B002NXSRVG", "B00005JM5E", "B00AEBBA72", "B001L9EXUC", "B0007WFX62", "B0013J55B6", "B002O3Z50Q", "B00000JQB5", "B002ZG977Y", "B00003CXTA", "B000GCFO0I", "B0000959N0", "B00AEFXCLU", "B0001O3YD0", "B001OQCV6A", "B0002ZDVEU", "B002ZG98N2", "B005LAIIPS", "B000IHY9TS", "B00005JM5B", "B004LWZWGA", "B000P0J0AQ", "B0053FANPY", "B00AEFY5B6", "B0085A9HU6", "B000CEV4XQ", "B00005RHGK", "B0000E2R6P", "B0006SSOHC", "B000OVLBHG", "B00AEFYGBA", "B002TMI2A2", "B0002VEUV2", "B009YQJ322", "B000EHRVP6", "B003ZKBELG", "B00005JNJV", "B002DKGWSE", "B000VWYJ86", "B005LAIHYU", "B00003CXSD", "B0015XHP2C", "B001GZ6QC4", "B00AZTUUQK", "B004EPYZT4", "B000TGJ80S", "B00027JZ3E", "B001GKJ2E8", "B001VLBDD0", "0767803434", "B004LWZWFQ", "B00195FUDC"], "bought_together": ["B003Y5H5EW", "B001HN697M"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003Y5H5EW", "B007WZTG1U", "B001VLFE7G", "B001HN697M"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 128315}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.94, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B0000VAFNQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/412NSB5PCYL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Underworld (Full Screen Special Edition)"}

{"description": "Somebody smart produced the director's commentary track forBig  Fish; they brought in an interviewer to keep Tim Burton on track, thus  avoiding those moments when a director gapes silently at his movie,  grasping for some fresh thought. This sense of control, however, fosters a  somewhat corporate atmosphere, which also infests the typically fatuous  featurettes about \"The Character's Journey\" and \"The Filmmakers' Path.\"  Which is not to say they're a waste: Ewan McGregor is simply the most  charming man in the world; the various beasties in the movie are  technically interesting; and there's an interesting bit about the author  of the book and the screenwriter, usually two of the most ignored figures  in cinema.

{"description": "Tony Kushner's prize-winningplayAngels in Americabecame the  defining theatrical event of the 1990s, an astonishing mix of philosophy,  politics, and vibrant gay soap opera that summed up the Reagan era for an  entire generation of theater-goers. Post-9/11 would  seem to be too late for a film version--philosophy and politics don't  always age well--but this 2003 HBO adaptation, ably directed by Mike Nichols  (The Graduate), provides a time capsule of the '80s and reveals the  deep emotional subcurrents that will give the play lasting power.The story centers around Prior Walter  (Justin Kirk) and Louis Ironson (Ben Shenkman), a gay couple that falls  apart when Prior grows ill as a result of AIDS. But cancer is not the only  thing invading Prior's life: He begins to have religious visions of an  angel (Emma Thompson,Sense and Sensibility) announcing that he is  a prophet. Louis, who doesn't cope well with disease and suggestions of  mortality, leaves and starts a relationship with Joe Pitt (Patrick  Wilson), a closeted Mormon who works for Roy Cohn (Al Pacino,Dog Day  Afternoon)--the real-life right-wing lawyer, notorious for his  ruthless behind-the-scenes machinations. Add in Joe's depressed and  hallucinating wife Harper (Mary Louise Parker,Fried Green  Tomatoes), his determined but open-minded mother Hannah (Meryl Streep,Adaptation), a fierce drag queen/nurse named Belize (Jeffrey  Wright,Basquiat, reprising his celebrated performance from the  Broadway production), and you've still only begun to discover the wealth  of characters and storylines in Kushner's ambitious work.The  powerhouse cast (also featuring James Cromwell, Michael Gambon, and Simon  Callow) is uniformly superb. The script has its weaknesses--some of the  fantastic elements, including Prior's journey to Heaven towards the end,  fall flat--but even what doesn't work is bristling with ideas and a  ferocious desire to capture human existence in this time and place.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["1559362316", "B00005AQMJ", "B000067D0Y", "B00A92MGLA", "0800141806", "B00KMULA9I", "B000053VAW", "1559360739", "B003VZNAU8", "B004AR4W4O", "B0000560PU", "B00005B8U4", "B000BZISX0", "B00D2UMHIS", "B006QVRVW2", "B0001HAGRE", "B00GUO2SKA", "B00018D3YQ", "B00996RSYM", "B003IG06PM", "B001CQONPE", "1559360615", "B00AEFY8MM", "B00005AWR9", "B00005JO5L", "B00005MKKV", "B00EU8RB14", "B00005QW5X", "B0000AYJV8", "B0045HCJ94", "B0000TAZB0", "B00EJGMF22", "B00008UALE", "B0030BOCFU", "0802136923", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B008SAPCAM", "B0007ZEOPK", "B001QUF3SW", "B00I4CWIVU", "B005ETAMFK", "B000PAAK5U", "B00005JOFQ", "B00GHP8SH4", "B0009W5IMO", "B00114XLZA", "B00F98FOPE", "B001Y7CVXC", "B007C95S9K", "B00G7QPXUI", "B000A9QK5K", "B00AXGX4DQ", "B0045HCJ8U", "B006QVRVJK", "B00H7LJ2UO", "B002VECLVO", "B00127RAGC", "B00008R9KD", "B00G4Q3KOC", "B00005JKIS", "B00005JKJA", "B005S9EIGU", "B004SIP71M", "B000NIVJFY", "B002SSNFUO", "B000228EGS", "B00003L9CK", "B004SUDQ1S", "B007V4QKYI", "1559363606", "B004LB5FCW", "B00005N89S", "B009XJ5ED2", "B0083V2VYG", "B000UPMZ30", "0767821009", "B002IVDLH8", "B00005V5NU", "B00GUO3C3W", "B00C1LIZMQ", "B000GG4Y32", "B009D004TA", "0802122388", "B00007L4MV", "155936078X", "B000WDVNMO", "B000068MBW", "1559363959", "B00004TJH0", "0571169341", "B00000F3FS", "B00FGVS0DM", "B000H5V8H2", "B0006GVJEY", "B0001HAGRY", "B000065V3L", "B0042L0OG8", "B00HUTPKA4", "B000YHQNCI", "B0030BOCMS"], "bought_together": ["1559362316"], "buy_after_viewing": ["1559362316", "B00005AQMJ", "B00AQKU1QC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 23141}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 15.99, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B0001I2BUI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/512MTZBBPML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Angels in America"}
{"description": "If thefirst seasonofStar Trek: Voyagerwas a shakedown cruise, then season 2 represents a vital blossoming of the series' potential. As Captain Janeway, Kate Mulgrew maintained Starfleet integrity in the lawless expanse of the Delta quadrant, and became the ethical conscience of her still-uneasy Maquis/Starfleet crew, whose unanimous loyalty would be dramatically proven in \"The '37's\" (a first-season hold-over). Janeway's moral guidance would also assert itself in \"Death Wish\" (a \"Q\" episode featuringNextGen's Jonathan Frakes) and \"Tuvix,\" in which life-or-death decisions landed squarely on her shoulders. Season 2 brought similar development to all the primary characters, deepening their relationships and defining their personalities, especially Robert Beltran as Chakotay (in \"Initiations\" and \"Tattoo\"), now firmly established as Janeway's best friend (and nearly more than that, in \"Resolutions\") and command-decision confidante.Solid sci-fi concepts abound in season 2, although \"Threshold\" is considered an embarrassment (as confessed by co-executive producer Brannon Braga in a self-deprecating \"Easter Egg\" interview clip). It was a forgivable lapse in a consistently excellent season that intensified Janeway's struggle with the villainous Kazon, exacerbated by a Starfleet traitor in cahoots with the duplicitous Cardassian Seska (played by Martha Hackett, featured in a lively guest-star profile). The psychologically intense \"Meld\" (featuring a riveting guest performance by Brad Dourif) was a Tuvok-story highlight, and the aptly titled \"Basics, Pt. 1\" provided an ominous cliffhanger, including a second planetary landing (in a season full of impressive special effects) that left Voyager's fate in question. DVD extras are abundant and worthwhile, especially the season 2 retrospective and \"A Day in the Life of Ethan Phillips\" (who plays Neelix under a daily ordeal of latex makeup). Several Easter egg surprises--including a music video performance by Tim Russ (Tuvok)--are hidden (but easily found) among the \"Special Features\" menus on disc 7. All in all, this was one ofVoyager's finest seasons, leaving some enticing questions to be answered inseason 3.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000228EBS", "B000127LW2", "B0002JP4GE", "B0002WZTCA", "B00062IDLA", "B00062IDCO", "B0007TKH66", "B00008972H", "B00005JLF5", "B0009I7NGW", "B00008KA59", "B00008KA57", "B00008KA5A", "B000A6CLL0", "B002HQKRBC", "B00008KA58", "B00008KGT0", "B000AOEMXC", "B00BHWG0DQ", "B000063V8R", "B00BHWG0CM", "B000063V8S", "B000062XFG", "B000063V8T", "B00005Y1NF", "B00062RCC6", "B001DHXT3Y", "B000ERVJJ0", "B000CCBCIA", "B0017VG69U", "B002BAW6GI", "B000RZIGVS", "B002BAW6FY", "B00AZMFJYA", "B000VDDDY6", "B000HEWEJ4", "B001DHXT6G", "B002I9Z8GM", "B003H9LIRK", "B00KHA9BQ2", "B000AOEMXM", "B00IWTVDUW", "B000CNE0T2", "B00IURL19Y", "B002I9Z8I0", "B003ZFC9M4", "B002BAW6FE", "B000CNE0TC", "B002BAW6H2", "B00JF5GAZA", "B001RHGRTS", "B00BHWG1AI", "B000CNE0SS", "B003Y7JWZ0", "B003H9LIU2", "B00IYRLUAU", "B000F8O2Q0", "B00BD6K54G", "B0042YZFYG", "B005DEUEV8", "074346754X", "B00AMDA2QC", "B000F8O2OM", "B00F3L8P26", "B000LC4ZI0", "B00JL6L4UY", "B00HETWFVC", "B00CTSDDVO", "B00CYQXHLC", "B00GTZWZH6", "B004HYW84G", "B000JLTRHW", "B00B7VZN76", "B000BOH990", "B002BAW6GS", "B00BN0WQ5I", "B00243FQFA", "B00CKYHH6O", "B00HWWUQYY", "B000F8O2PQ", "B00FFEM0W2", "B000EXDS34", "B0017MO11O", "B002MU4NM2", "B00ENFS0F0", "B00DYQ1GBE", "B0041B77RS", "B002JVWRDG", "B008JFUS0U", "B000HEZEY6", "B00466H3CW", "B0095XPZBC", "B00BHWG0G8", "B00008NV4G", "B000B5IP4W", "6303961614", "B00061QJSK", "B00000ILBK", "B00020HCBI"], "bought_together": ["B000127LW2", "B000228EBS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000127LW2", "B000228EBS", "B00062IDCO", "B00062IDLA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 13351}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 24.99, "brand": "Paramount", "asin": "B0001NBNFW", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Q0Lvhcy3L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Star Trek Voyager - The Complete Second Season"}
{"description": "Kintaro Oe, a 25-year-old dropout from Tokyo University Law School, bicycles around Japan \"learning about life\" like an AsianAlong Came Bronson. He takes various part-time jobs, surprising everyone by excelling at everything he does, despite his goofy demeanor. He's lucky he's a quick study, as he spends most of his time ogling pretty women, cleaning toilets, and getting beat up. In this six-part 1995 OAV, he writes code at a software company, helps a corrupt mayor get re-elected, and learns to make noodles by hand. The animation is often sloppy--Kintaro changes appearance frequently--and the artists clearly concentrated on the bouncing breasts and jiggling derri&#xE8;res. Kintaro is a good-hearted and generally agreeable goof, but the slight plots and leering humor of this series will quickly bore anyone but a lecherous adolescent. As Kintaro's enthusiasm is matched only by his libido, it's all very silly and often crass, with his visceral reactions digitally disguised.

{"description": "First of all, I am the type of person that likes to view rare and obscure horror flicks, hence why I bought Horror Rises From the Tomb on a whim. I was totally surprised by the DVD when it arrived. First of all, its a two disc set with three versions of the movie! The first disc contains the international uncut version in Full Screen and a version called the \"Clothed\" version in Widescreen. The \"Clothed\" version is easily the best looking of the three version and looks really crisp for a 30+ year old relatively unknown film. Unlike the \"uncut\" version, the \"clothed\" version actually contains alternate sequences that have many of the nude women \"clothed\", and also contains some alternate edits to cut down on the nudity. The \"uncut\" international version contains all the gore and nudity, but the negative doesn't look near as good as the \"cloth\" version. It's still easily worth having. The second disc contains yet a third version of the film which is a full screen transfer fo the U.S. cut release. This is easily the worst as it cuts out all the nudity and gore and the negative looks absolutly terrible. There is also a slew of extras included on the second disc including still gallaries, trailers, and bios. All this came housed in a double keep case that slipped nicely in a cardboard slipcase. I was totally blown away that such an obscure film would get released so nicely on DVD, since more popular movies by bigger distributors usually are unleashed in bare bone releases. If your a fan of rare Euro horror flicks such as Tombs Of The Blind Dead and The Beyond, then you will not be disappointed by this DVD release. If Child's Play 3 and Freddy Vs. Jason are what you consider to be difinitive horror films, then Horror Rises From the Tomb won't be your cup of tea.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000H5U6E8", "B000AC7P60", "B00HRUQ7WG", "B000H5U6DY", "B002DU0RFS", "B001LNON6W", "B00GD9GN6W", "B002LFPAMA", "B00005NSXY", "B0000D0YX8", "B00GBJWY76", "B000067DCX", "B0083Q4JX2", "B00006G8JZ", "B005E7SFDI", "B00005K3O8", "B00331YO9Q", "B000FP2Z0I", "B00DOZNGTK", "B00006ADD7", "B001JP64UA", "B00FMDL4UK", "B005DKS20M", "B000HXDWRS", "B008H1Q4XQ", "B0000A0DX9", "1932595872", "B008BAZ07Y", "B00006ADD8", "B00006G8I7", "B002G9U97C", "B000YDBP5W", "B001B1Q3LC", "B000U6YJZG", "B00005A069", "B001AD8FGC", "B0002V7SRU", "B001SGEUFQ", "B0007ZSHWG", "B0001FVE5O", "B0002V7SUW", "B008BWFOUU", "B00CU00JLS", "B0000A4GGF", "6305808198", "B00076ON0K", "B00000JYX9", "B0002JP2SO", "B006ZUMP1Q", "B000SAD8MY", "B0009ETD1E", "B000YKI4T0", "B001W8NO48", "B000NA1W90", "B0006L0LHK", "B000W0E50Y", "B000YDBP7A", "6305340382", "B000BT96UA", "B000EQ5U9Q", "B0015I2S0G", "B009CSVQRC", "B0000C8AUD", "B00AVHDVZ8", "B0002Y69VS", "B00CPPJK8Q", "B0007R4T0S", "B001V732VK", "B0063E0048", "B008N2Z1GA", "B000PMLJKS", "B0000639GG", "B006P4GHWA", "B0000AQS28", "B00005KHJO", "B000EQ5UB4", "B009H3LPKU", "B004NTDEXO", "B005OK0YQG", "B008X6S3TS", "B008BWFOVO", "B000795JN2", "B009L9TNVI", "B002M9FXTU", "B00003XAMP", "B00IICF4GC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001W8NO48", "B000H5U6E8", "B001CHFM58", "B001JP64UA"]}, "price": 1.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 313825}, "asin": "B0001XAK8I", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/517X2K6378L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Horror Rises From the Tomb"}

Season 5 is perhaps not as classics-packed as thethirdandfourthseasons, but no self-respectingSimpsonsfan should be without the episodes \"Homer's Barbershop Quartet,\" featuring George Harrison, \"Cape Feare,\" one of Sideshow Bob's (and guest voice Kelsey Grammer's) finest half-hours, \"Rosebud,\" \"Springfield (Or, How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Legalized Gambling),\" and \"Bart Gets Famous,\" with the Springfield-sweeping catchphrase \"I didn't do it.\" Plus, the star power this season is impressive: Michelle Pfeiffer as Homer's comely, donut-loving co-worker in \"The Last Temptation of Homer,\" Albert Brooks as a self-help guru who unleashes \"Bart's Inner Child,\" Kathleen Turner as the creator of Malibu Stacy in \"Lisa vs. Malibu Stacy,\" and, as themselves, the Ramones (\"Rosebud\"), James Woods (\"Homer and Apu\"), Buzz Aldrin (\"Deep Space Homer\"), and even Robert Goulet (\"Springfield\").But it is the writers and the core ensemble cast who exhibit, to quote \"Deep Space Homer,\" \"the right...

{"description": "This final sequence ofFarscapeepisodes is as effective and powerful a climax as those of earlier seasons. The three-parter \"We're So Screwed\" starts with \"Fetal Attraction,\" in which the crew of Moya attempt to rescue the pregnant Aeryn Sun from her Scarren captors and end up starting a dangerous epidemic on a space station. They get Aeryn back and lose Scorpius; in \"Hot to Katratzi,\" the necessity of saving his worst enemy--who just knows too much to be left a captive--forces John Crichton to gate-crash the Sebacean-Scarren peace conference and bluff his way to success. Seemingly betrayed by Scorpius, John snatches victory in \"La Bomba,\" striking another deadly blow against the Scarren empire. The title of the last episode, \"Bad Timing,\" refers both to the show's cancellation--the cast and crew felt real bitterness towards the SciFi Channel over this--and to the cliffhanger ending; the crew of Moya have to prevent a Scarren ship finding its way through the wormhole to Earth.Farscapewas perhaps the best-ever television space opera and certainly the most sexy, stylish, funny, and dramatic.

{"description": "It's clear right from the opening episodes of its third season thatFarscapehas finally developed into a grown-up show. There's a new self-confidence and a new maturity here that's entirely welcome after the often wildly erratic tone of the second season. The production design and high-quality effects work remain true to the show's original quirky style, although both the look and the more adult-themed scripts have become progressively darker.Season 3 is the year when the Wormhole story arc takes precedence, as the interactions between John Crichton and his nemesis Scorpius become ever more complicated (involving various different clones, real or \"neural\", of both antagonists). It's also the year that some major characters die, new ones are introduced, and Crichton (well, one version of him anyway) and Aeryn finally consummate their relationship. Moya's crew endures a vertiginous emotional roller-coaster ride when powerful issues of love, loyalty, and sacrifice loom large. They must also face their sternest challenge yet as the series' biggest story arc reaches an explosive climax aboard Scorpius's Command Carrier. Anyone who has not followedFarscapeextremely closely from the very beginning of season 1 will be utterly baffled by the convoluted plotting and complex character interactions.

{"description": "When a movie can blend passionate social concern with good old-fashioned suspense, it must be doing something right.Maria Full of Gracescores high on both counts. Maria is a Colombian teenager who, for a large paycheck, agrees to be a mule for drug-runners:  she has to swallow dozens of thumb-sized capsules of heroin and smuggle them into New York. This debilitating process is painstakingly described, and of course not everything goes as planned when Maria and her fellow mules land in America. Director Joshua Marston is working on a low budget, which explains the film's narrow, single-minded focus--but this may be a strength, not a weakness. The trump card is the lead performance of Catalina Sandrino Moreno, who won awards at the Seattle and Newport Film Festivals. Her empathetic face carries us along on Maria's journey, and humanizes a problem that is too easily relegated to a headline.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002FHGESI", "B00005JNCZ", "B0041KKYF6", "B000N3T0DW", "B00080Z53O", "B000O76ZQC", "B00005N8A9", "B00180IPM6", "B00008AOX5", "B0036TGSJE", "B008S2NABI", "B000YIGNCC", "B0007NBJHI", "B0042EJDGM", "B000RHRGSK", "B00AZMFKXK", "B005HFI7IU", "B000LV6OC6", "B00005JL57", "B0015ET3YO", "B003A0T8BO", "B004XVMCMG", "B000WC38IC", "B002M2T1VI", "B000N3SU6K", "B001ILTUKQ", "B0052LE7C4", "B005FIXA6S", "B002E01LOI", "B00GJNQ3S0", "B0047685T6", "B00075VX2C", "B00005JLQW", "B000AM4P90", "B001UV4XC4", "B004SIP7S0", "B00006G8G3", "B004SIP6GI", "B00005LZOD", "B0011FLH14", "B004MNM1FI", "B002M2T1V8", "B0086900LG", "B002BWP3UC", "B00E5G03KM", "B000AYEIDQ", "B00134PSV8", "B001FOPOD8", "B0000AMU29", "B00003CXRG", "B0014BQR6U", "B000274TLW", "B000LXHFMW", "B0000C9JFO", "B0001CNQX0", "B00004U1FA", "B00E1S1MMM", "B007961SAE", "B000GETTJI", "B004IF4EVY", "B00F6Y3E26", "B0032AJVE6", "B003O3EKRO", "B003X3BYJM", "B0009HLC9W", "B0000714BS", "B00000F5KH", "B002VECLXC", "B0000714BQ", "B0009S4IGK", "B002FUI4CE", "B00006BS7S", "B00APUAKYG", "B000K2V7F0", "B000SLYE6M", "0764146076", "B0000A2ZTY", "B0002VEZ3U", "1444137697", "B001M5BF7Y", "B000KJU15U", "B001Q56XOA", "B001QX014A", "0070020698", "B001S400C0", "B000VXUW0E", "B00H1RMPH6", "B000QYKDFC", "B000067IZ3", "B000JBXH78", "B00IQIAL8Y", "B007L6VPXC", "B0051T46YG", "B0002DRDIW", "B002EZLPOO", "B000N3T0DM", "B0002RQ316", "B0000U0X20", "B0013HL6ES"], "bought_together": ["B000O76ZQC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00180IPM6", "B0036TGSJE", "B005HFI7IU", "B000O76ZQC"]}, "price": 4.09, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 3577}, "asin": "B0002TT0MI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51o4PdGtr3L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Maria Full of Grace"}
{"description": "The rough-edged vitality of contemporary Irish filmmaking is readily apparent inIntermission, a deliriously ambitious black comedy in which 54 characters and 11 plotlines compete for consistently impressive screen-time. In a dazzling display of audacity, screenwriter Mark O'Rowe and first-time director John Crowley jump from one plot to another, tangling their characters in an infectious series of intersecting events, shifting from scenes of brutal violence, poignant compassion, and richly dark humor, and somehow managing to make it all fit together in a miraculously coherent tapestry of romance, crime, and authentic Dublin atmosphere. Colin Farrell andStar Trek: Deep Space Ninealumnus Colm Meaney are the familiar stars here, and they're in peak form on native soil, but the entire cast shines in equal measure, all of them playing malcontents striving for something better in a world that's simultaneously harsh and hilarious.

Something that is listed on the package, \"Explosive Deleted Scenes,\" is really about 7 minutes of ho-hum expository scenes.

{"description": "Season 4: Feel free to insert your own \"four-play\" joke, or for that matter, your own \"insert\" joke. Sex is still topic 1 for the intertwined group of \"exes and best friends,\" but in this pivotal season there are momentous \"relationship issues\" that will upend all their lives (insert your own \"upend\" joke while you're at it). Susan is pregnant, inspiring in Steve nightmares about his own execution and unflattering comparisons of the birth process to John Hurt's iconic gut-busting scene inAlien. Missing in action is the Kramer-esque Jeff (although he makes something of a return in the season finale). Joining the ensemble is Oliver, who is more in the Chandler mode as a lovable loser with the ladies. These inevitable comparisons to \"Sein-Friends\" are no doubt heresy toCoupling's most devoted viewers. Indeed, this series does benefit from creator and sole writer Steven Moffat's comic voice and vision. He provides his ever-game cast some witty, funny-'cause-it's-true dialogue, as in Oliver's observation that \"Tea isn't compatible with porn.\" This Britcom is also less inhibited in language and sexual situations than its American counterparts. In the cleverly-constructed opening episode, in which the same \"9-1/2 Minutes\" are witnessed from three different perspectives, Sally and Jane can do what was left to the imagination when Monica and Rachel offered to make out in front of Joey and Chandler. The birth of Susan and Steven's baby ends the six-episode season on a satisfying and surprisingly moving grace note. A bonus disc takes viewers behind the scenes with segments devoted to bloopers and interviews with cast and crew.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0001JXP7K", "B0000AQS8B", "B0000797E5", "B001PMRBMC", "B002AL2TPQ", "B00K2CHWYI", "B000FJGWC6", "B002C3GTLC", "B00006G9X4", "B002EOVX9W", "B00443FN1A", "B00HUCF7WW", "B001YYQA0K", "B0009WFFBS", "B001NOMOS8", "B002945DX4", "B003TY2STU", "B000F7CMSG", "B000SINSVC", "B001PWY4U4", "B002LFPAUC", "B000HLDFAE", "B003L77GTC", "B000TLTCPO", "B00E688720", "B0056GLNQI", "B000FFJYE8", "B004VPUR44", "B00GOC74QG", "B002LFPAUM", "B001AQBGM4", "B00361XWF0", "B00005U2KS", "B004EXWGHY", "B002AMVED8", "B002HWRZTI", "B001EHF3RS", "B0009NSCTY", "B001QE99BA", "B00361XWEQ", "B00BVMXBDO", "B00361XWFA", "B000PHX8RA", "B000QXDEH2", "B0009WFFB8", "B000GI3RZ6", "B00EJSMP20", "B002DQSKME", "B0000AUHQE", "B001ASIHZG", "B0009WFFD6", "B00363WGB4", "B000PC6YQC", "B00BUWD7Y8", "B000784WKO", "B0009FVS8Y", "B007K7IBTI", "B002OOWLEI", "B007AFC0W4", "B00662CH02", "B00GZP0MI4", "B005G172Q8", "B001OQCVCE", "B0000ALPJL", "B0009S2SQ2", "B000MGBLFK", "0765319616", "B009LDD1X0", "B0019MFY3Q", "B00FPPQYXM", "B004XM38CS", "B002AK9UPO", "B002HRF68A", "B009DS7CGU", "B001NXDIMK", "B000EWBNM8", "B00FFEM0W2", "B008KHIKWK", "B004MWLXTY", "B007AFS118", "B008B4LRMC", "B00AHQQHFE", "B0006N2EZK", "B00FEVZ960", "B00CYQXHLC", "B000ABKHZC", "B0000AQS0F", "B00BHLTIXQ", "B0089AD8IO", "B000KGGIRI", "B003EYVXXW", "B002ZCY80O"], "bought_together": ["B0001JXP7K", "B0000AQS8B"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0001JXP7K", "B0000797E5", "B0000AQS8B", "B0006HBLU0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 55977}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 18.1, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00065GX8C", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515BBZDNZ1L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Coupling - The Complete Fourth Season"}

{"description": "Deliverancegoes to high school in this grim, stripped-down fable of a prank gone bad. Friends decide to teach a lesson to a teenage bully by inviting him on a canoeing trip where they will humiliate him once and for all. The prank turns seriously sour, and the kids must deal with the consequences. Writer-director Jacob Aaron Estes takes a somber look at these lives, although his low-key approach makes the central tragedy seem melodramatic when it happens. The film isn't quite new enough to be truly revelatory, but Estes neatly avoids aRiver's Edgerehash by allowing his characters more than dead-eyed anomie. The actors hit their notes with precision, especially Rory Culkin (another of the Culkin family, with Macaulay and Kieran), Ryan Kelley, and Scott Mechlowicz. This is the kind of movie that may be slightly familiar to older audiences, but could easily be a home-video cult item with younger viewers.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0007NFLO0", "B0007R4TJ4", "B0002I8372", "B00IKM5OCO", "B0007Y08QA", "B00DUX290S", "0783233507", "B000F6II1M", "B0001EFUFK", "B00006JMQ4", "B009SFR2QI", "B000NO39FG", "B00G3DA5XA", "B0042FDCMC", "B005PTMPYA", "B00HUQCA28", "B008NNY8RM", "B000031EFY", "B000GI3KGC", "B00005U14H", "B00HQI811Y", "B001J9KJ48", "B00EOBB7LC", "B00DL46ZN8", "B00CBFB8SU", "B00657PLN8", "B0002VOY40", "B000PAAJZ6", "B000FVQM2Y", "B001KEGRBQ", "B00005RHGK", "B00013RC7K", "B000RGN2JI", "B002PI1NRO", "B00AEFYV9W", "B004PP3ICS", "B000CS464G", "B000059HA5", "B009OCR2U6", "B00BEIYG98", "B00000G02H", "B003EYVXTG", "B0009W5IQ0", "B00BTYPW7C", "B0000AOX0D", "B000077VRT", "B008ZQ4W64", "B000N3AW6G", "B002FP1426", "B005GT3XC2", "B0007GP6ZG", "B003Y5H4W0", "B004LXBKEC", "B00AEFXHNI", "B0064SVNAI", "B0000639HQ", "0792840127", "B00004ZBVO", "B0009R1TI6", "B00C7BZZ32", "B006KH6CF4", "B000WC38EQ", "B00187FPC2", "B000U1ZV76", "B003ASLJQS", "B0021L8UYY", "B000BX8R1A", "B0082CWTSY", "B00177YA6U", "B004O8OLO0", "B0054602PS", "B000053VAX", "B0009X75EC", "B004LWZW2O", "B009AMAGQM", "B000099T3J", "B0058ZPNOK", "B00AEFYCL4", "B000ZM1MGE", "B00003CXQA", "B0001KL5DA", "B000XUUQRE", "B00BTYJYR6", "B00D2UMHVK", "B000QEIOSU", "B0046WCM7M", "B009POCG0Y", "B00005Y4RY", "B007CO5E30", "B008G1JIQC", "B00005JL7Q", "B008NNY8O0", "B0013FW05Y", "B004FQX59S", "B000R4SMCW", "0767835093", "B001NPD9PY", "B002KQD66C", "B00007JXWX", "B000BBOUUE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001J9KJ48", "B0007NFLO0", "B000GI3KGC"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 129750}, "asin": "B0006IUDTY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/511RNWSTM9L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Mean Creek"}
{"description": "Because ofGilligan's IslandandThe Brady Bunch, writer-producer Sherwood Schwartz will forever be a TV hall-of-famer. They were his only real hits, but they were both grand slams in their prime times and have remained syndicated favorites ever since. Following closely on theGilligan's Islandseason 2release,The Brady Bunchis ready for home theaters with a nicely designed, 4-disc set of 25 first-season episodes. The pilot episode, \"The Honeymoon\" sets up the story we all know from the theme song (lyrics by Schwartz) by giving us the marriage of Mike and Carol and the coming together of the six kids. Schwartz provides commentary for just this first show, but he fondly recalls his intention of sweet, subdued, and often corny gags the pre-fab family encountered as a precise format each week. Two other episodes include commentary by Barry Williams (Greg), Christopher Knight (Peter), and Susan Olson (Cindy), and their reminiscences are equally affectionate about time on the show and everyone's surprise at its enormous success. EveryBradyepisode is a classic in some sense, and this first of five seasons (those kids did grow up fast) includes some real charmers when the six Brady kids still seemed impossibly young. It's hard to say the show was ever hip, even though it became slightly more attuned to a pop sensibility as the Bradys moved into the '70s. But man, is this 1969 everyfamily ever square. Even so, it's hard to resist the way each one gets their own screen time with shows devoted to simple childhood joys and traumas--Jan's missing locket, Cindy's missing baby doll, Greg's crush on his math teacher, Peter's swelled head when he gets his picture in the paper, etc.In a brief bonus featurette we get more innocuously entertaining interview comments from Schwartz, Williams, Olson, Knight, and Mike Lookinland (Bobby). It's interesting that all the subjects make note of how seriously the classically trained (now-deceased) Robert Reed took his role as patriarch, Mike Brady. His reputation as being \"difficult\" followed the long run of the show, but if Schwartz's first choice had gotten the role it could have been a lot worse. (Schwartz is delighted to reveal the famous name and career path that followed, so the mystery shouldn't be spoiled here.) As it was during its TV run,The Brady Bunchon DVD is clearly meant for a specific generation--yours.--Ted Fry", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0009I7NH6", "B000A0GORS", "B000B5XOUM", "B000CCBCHQ", "B0007V6IWQ", "B000291Q3Y", "B00GOC75YW", "B00HVFA36I", "B0009B16TO", "B0006BAWSI", "B005SQRYOG", "B0050MB5AC", "B00AEFXKIK", "B0006N2F0E", "B0072BNJ0I", "B00B1LQB2S", "B0002NY8PI", "B00FWMVVF4", "B000MGBSEY", "B000291Q3O", "B00GOC74RU", "B00I099K4U", "B000OVLBH6", "B00020X83Y", "B00DXLO086", "B0000C2IVT", "B000EQ45BU", "B000B7HZUK", "B0001CNQUS", "B0002JZT5U", "B00A2L1CKO", "B005M2A4CA", "B000HEZEYG", "B00008WJEZ", "B000B8I9ZY", "B000IJ79VG", "B0000DFZ5O", "B00009QG5P", "B0000AKY3Q", "B006OKOWBI", "B000E1MXVO", "B000002OND", "B000BB1MIW", "B000CELOVI", "B000E3L7FK", "B004IK30RI", "B000EXZFS0", "B00GOC75FQ", "B000C6NPHC", "B0014FAIYS", "B000ASDFIQ", "B0000V4906", "B0002DB5N6", "B000M343AS", "B000FQIRWC", "B00DXLO0BI", "B0007Y08P6", "B000M343AI", "B0002I837M", "B00HVFA39A", "B000HIVIOM", "B001992NXI", "B00DXLO0D6", "B000PY52CW", "B000AC7PF6", "B00KAVPEZA", "B000Z6GT18", "B000U1ZV4E", "B00AEBB98W", "B0001Z3I1C", "B0009OUBPQ", "B000LV6O12", "B00005JLIC", "B0077PBPZU", "B00GOC74Z2", "B000EGDANO", "B0001DMXEC", "B000FKP3XY", "B00008J2EB", "B00008NV4G", "B000BYRCF6", "B001LM64VK", "B0006IUDXA", "B0009UC80Q", "B000B8IA3U", "B000H1RFXM", "B00650RX90", "B0072BNKHA", "B0081VI0Z2", "B000FA57U8", "B008L36520", "B0007KIFK0", "B00IODHZ08", "B00016JE5U", "B00005JLIB", "B0001EFV9K", "B0009UC7MK", "B0007WQHFS", "B00A4Y62JU", "B002E58FT2"], "bought_together": ["B0009I7NH6", "B000A0GORS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000MGBSEY", "B0009I7NH6", "B000A0GORS", "B000CCBCHQ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 10514}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 12.99, "brand": "Paramount", "asin": "B0006Z2L4W", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51CGRZE2BTL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Brady Bunch - The Complete First Season"}
{"description": "This incredible, award-winning film features adventurer, poet and world-champion skier Yuichiro Miura as he and his team face the most challenging climb in the world, Mt. Everest. The ascent is fraught with tragedy, the descent miraculous. During the climb, they face an icefall that claims the lives of six of their team, still considered the worst natural disaster accident in Himalayan history. With a 35mm Panavision film crew in tow, they continue on to the South Col, only 350 meters from the summit, where Miura put his life in the hands of the gods in his descent. Using oxygen and a parachute to slow his speed, Miura skied 7,000 feet over sheer ice and rocks. Unbalanced by the gusting winds, he hit a boulder and fell 1,320 feet, smashing into rocks and ice ridges. A patch of snow was all that saved him, allowing his fall to end just moments away from the Bergshrund Crevasse. This final climax has been called the most exciting six minutes of film ever shot as Miura plummets helplessly down Everest's unforgiving icy slopes toward certain death.", "related": {"also_viewed": ["0062505750", "B00478IT86", "B0037A4ILC", "B004EI2NU4", "B000IWPP4G"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0062505750", "B00478IT86", "B000TEUSKY", "B001DWNUBU"]}, "price": 6.83, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 273134}, "asin": "B000777HU2", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516ntyQnePL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Man Who Skied Down Everest"}

{"description": "Audiences were captivated by the women of Wisteria Lane in the first season ofDesperate Housewives, the breakout hit from ABC that almost single-handedly lifted the network from its ratings doldrums and brought back the classic TV soap, remixed now with satire, comedy, and mystery. An affectionate yet darkly tinged send-up of suburbia that skirtedTwin Peaksterritory as much as that ofKnots Landing,Desperate Housewivesopened with a bang--literally--as perfect-seeming housewife Mary Alice Young (Brenda Strong) went through her picture-perfect day before putting a handgun to her temple and pulling the trigger. Mary Alice's sudden suicide leaves her four closest friends, all housewives of a sort, with a surfeit of grief, a re-examination of their own lives, and a mystery to solve. It also proves to be a catalyst for a seamy study of what goes on inside the finely appointed homes of Wisteria Lane--the tales of which Mary Alice narrates from beyond the grave with a sardonic tone dipped in both honey and arsenic.There's Martha Stewart-perfect Bree (Marcia Cross), who rules her household with an iron fist in a tailor-made garden glove and seems to have it all, until she finds out her husband (Steven Culp) is cheating on her--and had a serious fetish habit to boot. Sultry Gaby (Eva Longoria), the youngest of the set, is a bored trophy wife whose predilection for shopping and clothes are the perfect decoy for her affair with the hunky teenage gardener (Jesse Metcalfe). Former career woman Lynette (Felicity Huffman) is the most stereotypical housewife, raising four (or was it five?) kids and frustrated at using her cutthroat business skills for suburban politics. And daffy Susan (Teri Hatcher), the divorcee looking for love, sees her prospects brighten with the arrival of hunky plumber Mike (James Denton), who has some desperate secrets of his own. And did we mention the neighborhood hussy (Nicollette Sheridan), the snotty busybody (Christine Estabrook), and Mary Alice's increasingly agitated son (Cody Kasch)?It was a fast and wild mix of plot and characters that gaveDesperate Housewivesthe zing that made it a number one hit, as it never got too bogged down in any dilemma before moving on to the next. And though it was neither as hard-hitting nor salacious as it was trumpeted to be, the show nevertheless breathed fresh, funny air into comedy television, for even though it hewed to the hour-long soap format, the content was far more dark comedy than sudsy drama. There were fun bright spots to be had, but the story behind Mary Alice's death--which included drugs, murder, blackmail, secret identities, and vengeance in equal amounts--hovered over all the characters, tingeing the farce with the specter of danger. The show's other source of strength is in its peerless ensemble cast, headed by four perfect leading ladies, all Emmy-worthy. Hatcher received the (deserved) lion's share of praise (and a Golden Globe), but her co-stars--especially the underrated Longoria--matched her scene for scene. And though the mystery of Mary Alice's death was ultimately solved (noTwin Peaksteasing here), it was just the beginning of the troubles on Wisteria Lane, where no life went unexamined for too long.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000FIMG4U", "B000P6YNTI", "B0018CWEYO", "B001VPJYZK", "B003F3NDP8", "B003Y5HWGI", "B005Z28M58", "B0018CWEVW", "B00005JPII", "B000R7HRRA", "B003F3NE7K", "B0018CWEXA", "B00005JO9J", "B0001O3YLM", "B0018CWEZI", "B001VPJYZU", "B003L77G56", "B001VPJZ0E", "B003R0MEXQ", "B00G4RCNG2", "B003F3NDW6", "B0009IW88K", "B00684J49K", "B000P6YNSO", "B001L1S1SK", "B000FIMG5Y", "B000FUTVLO", "B000Q6GUKW", "B0077PTWX2", "B00166UFSY", "B0018CWEXK", "B000FFJYE8", "B003F3NDOE", "B00005JNEQ", "B00005JNOG", "B000AJJNI6", "B001VPJZ0O", "B003F3NE1Q", "B000TGURZ8", "B00369ERC4", "B0006IUE16", "B0002234R2", "B001MVWRNO", "B000CCBCGM", "B000GPIPTM", "B000QDLSR0", "B0002V7TZQ", "B000FUTVPA", "B001QE99AQ", "B002AMVED8", "1401302777", "B000EBGFPY", "B00684J49U", "B000GG4Y6O", "B003L77GEM", "B00004RFCM", "B000FVQLIO", "B000B5XOW0", "B001MVWRNE", "B000957O8C", "B00FR23PDU", "B00JF5GAZA", "B0000E5NPY", "B009RX7WTI", "B003R0MEW2", "B0009W5J4Q", "B001AQBGM4", "B0008JIJ1A", "B000H7JCGE", "B00382S9SW", "B001G0MFD8", "B000Q6GUW0", "B00AYVDUPW", "B0009CTVLS", "B000JLTRIG", "B009RX8GSE", "B001MVWRN4", "B001934SNM", "B004YM6JQO", "B000FIMG68", "B00382S9U0", "B0077PTWY6", "B002BAW6HW", "B0001IN0T4", "B0009K7QZ8", "B0009A407A", "B000NOKFGW", "B00JQF7ZR6", "B003L77GTC", "B0002MPQRS", "B00382S9UA", "B003FSTN4S", "B0081QF6Q8", "B0024FAD9C", "B000W6ZUUC", "B001B7CNZ6", "B000GTLQVW", "B0002RQ3MK", "B0077PTWHI"], "bought_together": ["B000FIMG4U", "B000P6YNTI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000FIMG4U", "B000P6YNTI", "B0018CWEYO", "B003F3NDP8"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 12745}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 12.84, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B00079FUI6", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51OX-la6a%2BL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Desperate Housewives - The Complete First Season"}

{"description": "Primerwon the Grand Jury Prize at the 2004 Sundance Film Festival and has drawn repeat viewers eager to crack writer-director-star Shane Carruth's puzzler of a time-travel drama. Carruth, an engineer by training, plays inventor Aaron, whose entrepreneurial partnership with fellow brainiac Abe (David Sullivan) unexpectedly results in a process for traveling back several hours in time. The men initially use these rewind sessions to succeed in the stock market. But a dark consequence of their daily journeys eventually complicates matters. If this sounds like a very commercial, science fiction thriller,Primeris anything but that. Shot on 16mm for $7,000, the film has a tantalizing, sealed-in logic, akin toMemento, that forces viewers to see the fantastic with a certain dispassion.

{"description": "While 2003'sDaredevilwas a conventional superhero movie, the 2005 spinoff,Elektra, is more of awuxia-styled martial arts/fantasy flick. Elektra (Jennifer Garner) has returned to her life as a hired assassin, but she balks at an assignment to kill a single father (Goran Visnjic,ER) and his teenage daughter (Kirsten Prout). That makes her the target of the Hand, an organization of murderous ninjas, scheming corporate types, and a band of stylish supervillains seeking to eliminate Elektra and tip the balance of power in the ongoing battle of good vs. evil.As the star ofAlias, Garner has proven that she can kick butt with the best of them, and some of the visual effects are impressive, but the action sequences tend to be anticlimactic, and there's not much to the story. Fans will notice numerous references toFrank Miller's comic books, but there's very little resemblance to Miller's cold-blooded killer (Elektra with an agent? Elektra referring to herself as a \"soccer mom\"?).IsElektrabetter thanDaredevil? Not really, even with the distinct advantage of having all Garner and no Ben Affleck. That could be the spinoff's greatest disappointment: afterSpider-Man 2raised the bar for comic-book movies,Elektralowered it back toDaredevil's level.  Directed by Rob Bowman (theX-Filesmovie), and featuring Terence Stamp as the mysterious mentor Stick, Will Yun Lee (Die Another Day) as the chief villain, and NFL-player-turned-mixed-martial-arts-champion Bob Sapp as the immovable Stone.DVD featuresBen Affleck's much-rumored cameo is one of the deleted scenes on theElektraDVD.  It's a one-minute throwaway, and while he's supposedly appearing as Matt Murdock (who romanced Elektra inDaredevil), the barrage of celebrity gossip makes it impossible to see him as anything other than Jennifer Garner's real-life boyfriend.  There's also a making-of featurette, which is mostly promotional hype other than a few interesting effects shots; four editing featurettes; and Jennifer Garner's videotaped message to ComicCon.--David HoriuchiMore onElektraElektra: The Album(Soundtrack CD)Elektra: The Movie(Comic Adaptation)Frank Miller Comic BooksDaredevil(Director's Cut) (DVD)Jennifer Garner stars inAlias(DVD)More Superhero DVDs", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000959N0", "B000VI70QS", "B00005JNTU", "B0006L0LOS", "B000FGGE68", "B001QB9H1U", "B001CDR1FG", "B000OVLBF8", "B00AEFXCLU", "B0002IQMAM", "B005LAIGW8", "B001DHXT20", "B004EPZ07K", "B001F7MSFM", "B001GCUO1Q", "B0009A409S", "B008JFUS0U", "B002GSXKNI", "B00E5I2MEK", "B004LWZW42", "B0007V6ITE", "B000UR9T8C", "B001AK3S4Y", "B00K7IPFSM", "B00E5I2MCM", "078401132X", "B00E5I2M9K", "B00005JM5B", "B0090SI56Y", "B00005JKWJ", "B004LWZWFQ", "B0002KVUKM", "B000HCO83Q", "B003YOZNBU", "B000J10EQU", "B00003CXZ1", "B00E5I2M6I", "B000AYELVU", "B00005JMQW", "B008JFUO72", "B003Y5H5EW", "B000HEVZ9E", "B000AYELVA", "B000VI28Z6", "B00JL6L4UY", "B009MO57H6", "B00AEFYGBA", "B002ZG99B8", "B0083SBMBM", "B001CC7PKS", "B00005JKCH", "B0007WFX62", "B0006IIPIK", "6307397594", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B0009MDPYM", "B001OQCVI8", "B00JPS7HOA", "0780624890", "B00F4FFO8E", "B002GSXKN8", "B008JFUPFI", "B00IKM5LXG", "B00177Y9ZC", "B003YAR97K", "B002ZG98UA", "B002NXSRVG", "B000EQHXN2", "B001RHGRT8", "B00IZZDWKM", "B001GZ6QC4", "B004LWZWGA", "B0021L8V0M", "B000VR0570", "1558908846", "B001HN697M", "B00005JLYW", "B008JFURII", "B001MVWRNE", "B001FB55HQ", "B005LAII44", "B00A2H9OSK", "B001QTXM5Y", "B002ZG983M", "B00BTYMPUY", "B002U4UZSQ", "B001QB9H2E", "B002ZG99G8", "B005G4TJUC", "B0012RLX88", "B003Q6D2B4", "B00195FUDC", "B008Y1YK9Y", "B001OQCUZM", "B00HMVJB0K", "B002ZG98N2", "B00005JNJV", "B004SIP9Z6", "B000K7UBSO", "B00HEPDGKA"], "bought_together": ["B0002XVQNU", "B000VI70QS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005JLXE", "B0090SI56Y", "B00979KQAO", "B000VI28Z6"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 23534}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.99, "brand": "TCFHE", "asin": "B0007P0Y7C", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51R5W%2BoU9CL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Elektra (Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "It's hard to believe, but for the first three seasons nobody really knew thatSeinfeldwas about, well, you know. It wasn't until season 4--unleashed here in a four-disc set that's equal in scope, quality, and quantity of bonus material to its predecessors--that the show really became something. In a series which can claim every installment as classic, the two-parter on disc 1 titled \"The Pitch/The Ticket\" truly stands out as a defining episode and, in retrospect, markedSeinfeld4 as the breakthrough season. It's the one where (fake) NBC executives express their interest in working with Jerry Seinfeld on a TV show, then moves to the who's-on-first shtick of George successfully pitching Jerry on creating \"a show about nothing.\" Scattered throughout the discs in commentaries by cast and creators and in numerous \"Inside Look\" documentaries, nearly everyone expresses some anxiety about the season having a story \"arc\" depicting Jerry and his \"real\" life becoming a sitcom. The show had been only marginally successful up to that point anyway, and with the edict, \"no hugging, no learning,\" still in place, maybe messing with nothing was a bad idea. What makes the arc so arch is the self-reflexive way it details the reality of Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David coming up with the concept and pitching it to (real) NBC executives as a show that really was about, well, you know. In one of the many informally informative interview segments, Jerry remembers hitting a stride during this time when a lot of crazy ideas started to make sense. \"Everything was just a wild guess,\" he says, \"and it takes a while to get confident that you're guessing pretty good. I think sometime in season 4 we realized we were guessing pretty good.\" Oh, that we could all be so good at nothing.Season 4 also gave us the episodes \"The Bubble Boy\" (\"He lives in a bubble!\"), \"The Pick\" (\"There was no pick!\"), and, perhaps most memorably, \"The Contest.\" Recalling how nervous he thought NBC might be about a show based on how long a person can remain--ahem--master of his domain, Larry David says that he kept the idea hidden for a long time. He may have had NBC sweating, but the episode goes by without anyone uttering the word that it's really about. The curmudgeonly David also observes that another famous season 4 episode, \"The Outing,\" only made it on the air due to a network \"note\" about making sure it wouldn't be offensive to homosexuals. Hence we have the addition of another standard to theSeinfeldlexicon of American pop culture: \"Not that there's anything wrong with that!\" Not only wasn't there anything wrong with it, the episode won a GLAAD Media Award. Season 4 also broughtSeinfeldits first Emmy for Outstanding Comedy Series. Stay tuned for season 5 (and a move to the coveted Thursday-at-9 slot) when the volcano we now know was always brewing really blew its comedic top.--Ted Fry", "related": {"also_bought": ["B008LCRAFC", "B0002UE1WQ", "B008LCRA7K", "B008LCRA98", "B00005JLEX", "B008LCRABQ", "B008LCRAC0", "B0002UE1X0", "B0006IUDYY", "B004D2GMVM", "B000957O8C", "B0001BS3IY", "B000BBOUF4", "B006MFQ4DE", "B000BNTM46", "B000T22PVG", "B000FBH3WC", "B000RBA6CO", "B000002VGR", "B000A0GOQ4", "B0001ZMWXW", "B000TGJ82G", "B00CJ7Y1CK", "B000067DNE", "B000SQFC0O", "B001MVWRNE", "B00070HK4C", "B00000JWVS", "B0058JEI06", "B000BYA4JW", "B007KFZ8B4", "B0002WZTLQ", "B0024FAD9M", "B0058J3S16", "B0019D151K", "B0007R4SWC", "B001B9LWME", "B003YLM79E", "B0007Y08JW", "B000M341S2", "B0007US79Y", "B00BUWD7Y8", "B0001NBNJ8", "B003CJXJ8Q", "B00BXTH474", "B00IFK7ONI", "B002E58FT2", "B00K8HAJN8", "B00067BCB8", "B00EQ2KU7G", "B003L77G9W", "B0001NBNIY", "B00008NV4G", "B009LDD1X0", "B000TZJBPQ", "B000VDDE18", "B000U1ZV76", "B001DMVZKI", "B003YLM78U", "B000B5XOUC", "B000068CNX", "B001GQ3GHG", "630529142X", "B007KFZ8AK", "B000ERVJMW", "B009LDD4BO", "B0053O89WY", "B005D0OHA6", "B002ZG971U", "B001AEF6AY", "B007KFZ8AA", "B0020TS5EM", "B007KFZ7Q0", "B008G33PIM", "B000BYCAJE", "B00DJYJRHG", "0310335280", "B003TFAJ18", "B0052C5EHK", "B003UD7JAI", "B00BT1XCOU", "B000BGR1B4", "B0000027RL", "B0089BSNVK", "B003R0MEZ4", "B0045HCJRG"], "bought_together": ["B008LCRAFC", "B008LCRA7K"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0002UE1WQ", "B008LCRAFC", "B008LCRA98", "B00EIJTLK4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 4086}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 11.98, "brand": "Columbia Tri Star", "asin": "B0007YXRCW", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/512590Q1ZAL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Seinfeld: Season 4"}

{"description": "Like, radical, dude--but not nearly as funny as it should be, even though it was a box-office hit. Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter are a pair of dim Valley boys, whose life is made heinous by a school history project. Enter George Carlin as a futuristic dude with a time-traveling phone booth. So Bill and Ted go back in time to round up a gang of historical figures (Socrates, Joan of Arc) to bring back for their presentation. Abe Lincoln at the mall? That's about as witty as it gets, rendering this the kind of comedy that gives teenaged audiences a bad name.--Marshall FineIt is the future. Society has at last solved all its major problems, thanks to amiable lunkheads Bill and Ted and the inspiring music of their band, Wyld Stallyns. Only one man is dissatisfied with the way things have turned out, the evil De Nomolos. In an effort to change the future, De Nomolos sends evil Bill and Ted robots back in time to prevent the real Bill and Ted from winning a pivotal Battle of the Bands. What follows is a spirited journey through the afterlife as Bill and Ted try to rescue their girlfriends, save the future, and, oh, yeah, learn how to play the guitar.Bill & Ted's Bogus Journeyswings easily between childish and clever humor, and is good at both: a Bergman reference is quickly followed by an equally funny bit about Death's stinky feet. Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter seem happy to be reprising their roles and even manage to add funny spins on Evil Robot Bill and Ted. William Sadler very nearly steals the movie as Death, playing both his wounded dignity and budding desire to be funky to a T. As if that weren't enough, George Carlin returns as Rufus and Pam Grier does a cameo just for the hell of it. Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey is ample proof that not all sequels suck.

{"description": "Fans of Christina Ricci will note that the saucer-eyed actress takes a big leap from deadpan-child and grumpy-ingenue roles withProzac Nation, an adaptation of Elizabeth Wurtzel's bestselling book. Ricci puts her all into playing Lizzie, a self-absorbed Ivy League writer wannabe who alienates friends and family with her out-of-control mood swings and other chemical imbalances. Ricci is committed and convincing, but nothing she does ameliorates Lizzie's exasperating personality; spending 90 minutes around this person is an eternity of tantrums. Around to provide audience stand-ins are Jason Biggs, Michelle Williams, and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, all of whom disapprove of Lizzie's self-destructive behavior. Jessica Lange, professional as always, is Lizzie's brittle mother. If the movie really did capture the sense of the zeitgeist suggested by its grandiose title, or if it carried some intriguing stylistic urgency that carried us into its depressive labyrinth, perhaps Lizzie's journey would be palatable. But the long delay betweenProzac Nation's shooting (in 2001) and its emergence on cable-TV and DVD is all too easy to understand.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B003IY498Y", "B00AEFXJ86", "B000HC2M0C", "0767821009", "B00003CWQR", "B004P7CN3G", "B00008Z463", "B0004Z3242", "B00AEFXJ1I", "B00005JLD1", "1573229628", "B003IY49K2", "B00005JMON", "B000092T3X", "076782153X", "B00ET2ODTE", "B00DW5IKYS", "B00JJ3EHCG", "B00EMAGKNU", "B00013RC2K", "B000FO0AD8", "B000021Y7L", "B00005UW73", "B004U7MR4G", "B001KEHAEE", "B005TTEFZ8", "B004OUZLGK", "B000GIXLXE", "B006Z7Z3VS", "B0037QGS0A", "B001URA5Y8", "B00020VZTS", "B00080ZHD2", "B00005QJIG", "B0083QN87K", "B000JBXXYK", "B00C7T0EPS", "0780625528", "B000TLTCQI", "B001CRC4DG", "B00005R87R", "B000255LIY", "B000BBOUUE", "B000DZ8540", "B000BX8R10", "B009M4KTUG", "B001URA5XY", "B000FIHN5M", "B00005JKJG", "B005Z9MGRG", "B006M3M5FM", "B00005Q4CS", "B00023P4I8", "076782170X", "B0030BOCMS", "B000F7CEC0", "B004SUDQDQ", "B007CEFTSA", "B00G5GNZ78", "B00EVU3T26", "B000F0UUD2", "0743223314", "B006ZGROB6", "B000089798", "B008NA3I30", "B005M2AKJW", "B009L79YRI", "B002ZG97O2", "B0029Z8K74", "B001C5LLVE", "B00BTYXNPK", "B00CPTUO1Y", "B000PKG8TM", "B0040J1RX6", "B00GPPXNIK", "B0006FO8E8", "B005M2AKLK", "B00375LBKI", "B0045HCIYA", "B00DVD5SBE", "B006GL8NQ0", "B00E8G5HXM", "B004XNNUZ2", "B002Q3MZXE", "B00I208ZHA", "B00005JMIJ", "B00005T30L", "B00003CXK7", "B00HW3EJ6Y", "0783241909", "B00AY6PK5A", "B0020LH8WU", "B00ET2ODU8", "B00C68SIUS", "B00068S3WS", "B00817TUVO", "B000LAZDPG", "B009OCR2U6", "B000022TSK", "B000PHX5MS"], "bought_together": ["B00AEFXJ86", "B003IY498Y"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AEFXJ86", "B003IY498Y", "B00003CWQR", "B000HC2M0C"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 118534}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 20.15, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B00094ASC2", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51M300CS04L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Prozac Nation"}

{"description": "It's time for a follow-up appointment at McNamara-Troy, Florida's hottest--and most dysfunctional--plastic surgery center, and the setting for the controversial television dramaNip/Tuck, which gives audiences a peek into the professional and private lives of two driven doctors and their (mostly female) patients. If thefirst seasonhad its share of shocking visuals and storylines, viewers should probably strap themselves into their easy chairs for the events in season 2. In addition to the usual offbeat medical issues (the team gives a man breasts, reconstructs a woman's sexual organs, restores a host of gruesome mutilations, and comes very close to undoing Joan Rivers's face work), Drs. McNamara (Dylan Walsh) and Troy (Julian McMahon) must deal with a vicious serial killer known as the Carver, a vengeful former patient (Jill Clayburgh), a woman with alleged stigmata, and a life coach (Famke Janssen) who reveals a stunning secret past--all in the course of just 16 episodes. Guest turns by Alec Baldwin, Vanessa Redgrave (the real-life mother to series regular Joely Richardson), and Sarah Paulson (Deadwood) compliment the already high-quality performances by the cast, and the episodes seem to have ditched the glibness of season 1 in favor of a more serious tone, which makes for a more uniformly enjoyable watching experience. As with the season 1 set,The Complete Second Seasonincludes several extras, most notably 45 minutes of deleted scenes, and a featurette titled \"Recurring Pain,\" which explores the relationships between three female characters and Dr. Troy.--Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000FUTVLO", "B0001O3YLM", "B000QUTTPG", "B0013FSL16", "B001PQZYQI", "B003CN5SAY", "B000QUTTPQ", "B000OIOOVE", "B000ENUYGI", "B0008JIJ1A", "B00JF5GAZA", "B00079FUI6", "B00166647K", "B001QE99AQ", "B000QUTTQ0", "B000FIMG4U", "B000FFJYE8", "B000Q6GUKW", "B000FVQLIO", "B00166UFSY", "B001AQBGM4", "B000FIMG68", "B003L77GTC", "B0018CWEZI", "B002AMVED8", "B0018CWEYY", "B000P6YNTI", "B002JVWRAE", "B000QDLSR0", "B002ZCY80O", "B0015ABRE2", "B00IYMSMTM", "B000FKO3GW", "B00005JNOG", "B0019LY5IM", "B000FIMG5Y", "B007C8RZL0", "B000P6YNSE", "B0036TGTF2", "B003CPPY5G", "B003L77GHE", "B003L77GRO", "B0007QS324", "B000V86OKG", "B001VPJYZK", "B0013ZGN9I", "B0012CJQY6", "B004R35DLW", "B00008AOX3", "B001B7N4WM", "B0024FAR5M", "B0012CJQZA", "B002N5N5M0", "B0002I84FS", "B002N5N5QQ", "B00005JO9J", "B0002DRE72", "B003F3NDP8", "B0002V7TZQ", "B0002RQ3MK", "B00IWTVDXO", "B0000E5NPY", "B00DXP7L88", "B00005Y6YJ", "B000HT3P6U", "B000SO7PCE", "B0009K7QZ8", "B000EAT23C", "B0002XVQSU", "B001B7CNZ6", "B000Q6GUW0", "B000P6YNSO", "B0018CWEYO", "B000YW8RPE", "B000B8IA08", "B004YM6JSW", "B003L77GKG", "B0012CJQYQ", "B00FOHHMWI", "B007HHWJD0", "B003R0MEXQ", "B0020TS5EM", "B005FISBTO", "B0038M2ALO", "B000G1R4TS", "B000F3UAE8", "B0002MPQRS", "B0007PALZ2", "B000AQ68Z0", "B00000FBH2", "B003BGZ618", "B0012CJQYG", "B0036EH3XE", "B0077PTWY6", "B000B5XOVQ", "B00AZTUUQK", "B0002234R2", "B000F1IQI2", "B000NDEXK2", "B0058YPQ0C"], "bought_together": ["B000FUTVLO", "B0001O3YLM"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0001O3YLM", "B000QUTTPG", "B000FUTVLO", "B001PQZYQI"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 22853}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 12.99, "brand": "WEA", "asin": "B0009IW88K", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41oaEUast8L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Nip/Tuck: Season 2"}

{"description": "Who was Greta Garbo? For a while the greatest of all movie stars, then a celebrated recluse, always \"the mysterious lady,\" Garbo purred, \"I want to be alone,\" and people took her at her word. Of course, the real Garbo is actually the \"reel\" Garbo, the silvery, suffering creature on the movie screen--the way the light caught her eyes, and the way she slithered around in silk. There are other Garbo films to be seen, butGarbo: The Signature Collectionis the essential Garbo, the alpha and omega for fans and beginners. This 10-disc package collects seven of her MGM sound pictures, three silents, and the Turner Classic Movies documentaryGarbo, which gives a good career overview and warm testimony from friends and relatives (although more critical perspective on her talent would have been welcome). Some extras and commentaries are mixed in.TheGarbo Silentsdisc featuresFlesh and the Devil, one of her sizzling box-office duets with John Gilbert;The Temptress, a wild number with Garbo as a man-killer who follows Antonio Moreno to the plains of Argentina; andThe Mysterious Lady, a tight spy picture with Garbo as a Russian agent seducing the susceptible Conrad Nagel. When Garbo finally talked it was headline news, and ifAnna Christiehas aged a bit, the star's sultry enunciation of \"Gimme a visky\" retains its historic punch. (The disc includes a German-language version of the film shot at the same time.)Mata Haricontinues the exotic storytelling of Garbo's silent years, as she does an eye-popping turn as the famous German spy.Grand Hotelcasts her as a tired, tired ballet dancer, in a star-studded MGM project that played on her public image as aloof and mysterious. The movie was a box-office smash and took the Best Picture Oscar for 1932, and still stands as a glittery gem of the studio system. Under the sympathetic direction of Rouben Mamoulian inQueen Christina, Garbo flourishes in a tale of a Swedish royal who escapes the grind by disguising herself as a boy. She insisted that John Gilbert--his career in tatters and his life near its end--be her leading man. Garbo rarely seemed more spot-on, and the film's final grand adoration of her is justifiably famous.Anna Kareninais Garbo's second crack at the Tolstoy heroine, after the silentLove. It's a throbbing performance, even if the movie itself is one of those MGM productions that seems to doze under all its finery and respectability.Camilleis scrumptious costume tragedy, with Robert Taylor as co-star and George Cukor as director. Finally, Ernst Lubitsch'sNinotchka(you know--\"Garbo Laughs\") is a bubbly comedy of frosty Sovietism meeting the champagne pleasures of Paris. Garbo retired two years, ending her reign but keeping the enigma intact.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000E6ESXK", "B000E6ESWG", "B000F7CMRC", "B0047BXR1C", "B0009S4IKG", "B001QFFBAM", "B000E8JO32", "B00DEO0JD2", "B004JK5VVU", "B004JK1O7U", "B00005A8TW", "B00005QW59", "B000F76MFA", "081095897X", "B000YRY7VC", "081664182X", "B0024FAG7Q", "B00A01CQIS", "B00GOC752E", "B004JK77IU", "B0008ENID4", "B004H83IFU", "B0026R5708", "B000EQHXIW", "B000GIXLVQ", "B002EAYEGK", "B0001WTWYW", "B000I2JDF8", "B000E6ESX0", "B000W9TTSS", "8857220524", "B003TGW5IW", "B000MTEFV4", "B002EAYE38", "B004132I6Q", "B00IF0KASY", "B000TXP56M", "B000HWZ4EI", "B002EAYE4M", "0847827240", "B00KIZY2QA", "B000E0OE1M", "B004JK3T8M", "B0018RU45U", "B000XNZ7NO", "B000FTCLSK", "B000ION7A8", "B009RNK10K", "B00114XLUA", "B00L3ZB7PS", "B0007OY2PS", "B00007CVS4", "1849542511", "B00C68SHOK", "B00008CMRO", "B000MGBLHI", "B000HT3Q2S", "B000UJCAK4", "B000FKO3V2", "B001OSC4G0", "B006H37P2K", "B0037RBVLU", "B00K6D1QV8", "B000M2E31I", "B008CZDW82", "B0012GVMI0", "1631739026", "B00KIZY0EE", "B00007CVS8", "B000FTCLRQ", "B0007RTB9M", "B000GIXLUW", "B004NTXH5Y", "B0033AI4AW", "B000GRUQK6", "B000FFJYAW", "B001KXZGNW", "B0026YBPES", "B004VHOAGS", "B00K6D1S7A", "B00JXVNWX4", "B008CZDVA6", "0684807254", "B008JEJROE", "B00CLF822A", "B002YNQEF6", "B004K4FUT8", "B005VPNJ2A", "B00005JKGX", "B0024FAG1M", "B0024FAG6W", "B00003CXBZ", "B008D1Q1VU", "B005F265IE", "B000HWZ4ES", "B007N5YJMU", "0780022343", "B000085EFE", "B00J7YV09K", "B000N3T0FK"], "bought_together": ["B000E6ESXK", "B000E6ESWG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000E6ESXK", "B0009S4IKG", "B0009S4IJC", "B000E8JO32"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 58820}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 32.78, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B0009S4IJM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41uJ805HvPL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Greta Garbo - The Signature Collection (Anna Christie / Mata Hari / Grand Hotel / Queen Christina / Anna Karenina / Camille / Ninotchka / Garbo Silents)"}

{"description": "\"A spacecraft from another solar system invades the night sky. But this is not our sky, and we are the invaders. The search for alien life has begun.\" So beginsAlien Planet, a Discovery Channel production that combines cutting-edge computer animation and video technology, interspersed with interviews of top scientists and filmmakers (Stephen Hawking and George Lucas, among others), to examine what life might really be like on another planet.  Darwin IV, the subject of this interstellar journey, is home to a wild variety of dinosaur-like creatures, bizarre beasts, and exotic vegetation of every kind. The idea is human beings have sent an unmanned spacecraft, packed with computer-driven droids--something right out ofStar Wars--to a planet 6.5 light years away. We follow along as the probes explore the planet and encounter aliens and situations of every kind, as the scientists weigh in on what they think we might really find there, and why. It&#x92;s all motivated and informed by real missions being undertaken today. While it&#x92;s all speculative, the story itself is still fascinating and events unfold according to the laws of physics, just as they would here on earth. The viewer experiences Darwin IV through the eyes of the probes; the spectacular computer animation offers stunning recreations of their explorations, and the creatures the writers have come up with are highly imaginative. The scientists&#x92; insights add to the experience by explaining the thinking behind the moments in the story, and by being appropriately relatable (one contributor compares sending the unmanned probes to the planet to watching your child at a spelling bee, hoping they make the right choice). While it&#x92;s obvious thatAlien Planetis a great show for students and educators, its appeal is far wider,this is a highly entertaining program that should feed the imagination of anyone who&#x92;s ever wondered about life on other planets.--Daniel Vancini", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000YEDYU", "B0007MAO0W", "B001DWNUBA", "B000BNI9EU", "0894806297", "B00005U2KN", "B0012IV3PU", "1933492929", "B00153ZQY6", "B0014VPFIG", "B005HIU9G0", "B004QSQMG8", "B00008AOWU", "B0013KY868", "B001CIOCP8", "0894805002", "B00017LVSM", "B00308BAOO", "B00FOLGW5C", "B0083VP2KQ", "B00IWULQQ2", "B0007Z0O04", "B00008AOWQ", "B001451HXO", "B00008438U", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B0036K9CJ6", "B00IWULSTC", "0921820879", "B00062IZZE", "B001F0TT10", "0857685848", "0881623016", "B00F3L8P26", "B00005JKLZ", "B00JL6L4WC", "B0012Q732O", "B0088X7YU0", "1552977242", "B00652U6EW", "B00AYV9U8I", "B0047HXMMU", "B0030BS1F2", "B000WR1XRK", "0811847365", "B00FQI1S1G", "B006QVRUY6", "B001V9K8JC", "B00003Q43D", "0061052388", "B001J863EO", "B00465I1BK", "B001451HX4", "B004DURSNA", "B004Z4LZ7E", "B00BCMT4D4", "B008JFUQZ2", "B002ZG98LO", "B0030ZOYHC", "B0064EGQ8G", "B008XTVWHK", "1552977234", "B00133KHBK", "B00EF0NY7W", "B008JFUR10", "B00D9EJFV4", "B00C7A8WZQ", "B007QWF26C", "B002DHACT2", "B00AEFXLKC", "B00BEZTMFY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0894805002", "B0007MAO0W", "B0000YEDYU", "0894806297"]}, "price": 9.96, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 229750}, "asin": "B0009VRHLA", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51YQQ9D6VCL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Alien Planet"}
{"description": "A frame-bursting roster of actors crowds this two-part HBO miniseries, which is nothing less than a look at America through the lens of a small New England town. Richard Russo adapted his ownnovel, a story of a gently depressed factory town that has always been run by the wealthiest family around (currently lorded over by matriarch Joanne Woodward). Ed Harris plays the central role, a decent, cautious man who runs a local diner and carefully negotiates the political niceties of Empire Falls; Paul Newman is his rapscallion of a father (the son is perpetually picking food out of Dad's beard), Helen Hunt is Harris's ex-wife, Aidan Quinn his feistier brother, and Robin Wright Penn his tragical mother seen in flashbacks.The goal of Russo and director Fred Schepisi seems to have been fidelity to the novel, which gives the film a pleasingly relaxed pace but also a somewhat literal-minded binding. Even that doesn't explain the general lack of tautness, or why so much of the dialogue has an awkward fit in actors' mouths. Harris and Newman, of course, are younger and older versions of American monuments, and their sheer presence goes a long way toward making the picture work (for the premium Newman-Russo match, see Robert Benton's sublimefilm ofNobody's Fool). Most of the twists in the final reels are genuinely affecting, and the movie has the courage to end on a mild note rather than strain to tie everything up. It's a fitting finale for an unassuming enterprise.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00BTYRB58", "B004SUDQ8G", "0375726403", "B002LVVCJY", "B00005BCK9", "B0014GI6I2", "6305803765", "B00008WI9N", "B00112S8RS", "0679753338", "B001P3SA8K", "B000E33VWW", "B00AQBDU4Q", "B0000BXMZ8", "B0000DZTLW", "B004SIP71M", "B008220DGE", "B0006GW2JU", "B00320J6WS", "B00008K7AO", "B00000G02H", "B0006FO8PC", "B00003CWTI", "B000HWZ4D4", "B00008MTW0", "6305781095", "B0060ZJ7DA", "B004SIP6C2", "B00000IC7G", "B00AEBB8SS", "B00AQTY3JO", "0679753834", "1400030900", "B00AEFY9GW", "B00441GYOM", "B000M341SC", "B0013XZ2QK", "B00AEFXE9U", "B00FZ4KR4U", "0679432477", "B000N3SU92", "B00DDY45DI", "B00005JMW7", "B0002S94C0", "B00006HAWL", "0375701907", "B0010DM3R4", "0307949761", "B00GSBMNOQ", "B0012E2F60", "B001BSBC16", "B000RIWAVC", "B000F3UAFC", "B004SUDPZA", "B00BQ44ERE", "B000E5KUJC", "B00070HK2E", "B001LRJH0U", "B00008MTW2", "B000KNFP6G", "B0001I2BUI", "B00012L786", "B00005YUO1", "B001KP2J6W", "B0060ZJ7AI", "B009B1EPQ4", "B008XAT0TQ", "B004TKYHJ2", "B0028YW3DS", "B001P3SA8A", "6305127654", "B004SIP73U", "B00H7LJ2UO", "B00J7YV0UE", "B000NQRR34", "B00BTYOYK8", "B00979KQ4U", "B00GST8U4U", "B000TLTCPO", "1558908331", "B008220DIC", "B00G7QPXUI", "B00002E20R", "B002DU39GW", "B00005AUKB", "B00005KHJJ", "B006ZGROB6", "B004SUDQD6", "B00E3QJ8DC", "B0000640VK", "B003ZFXE82", "B00H9L26AA", "B003Z1OHGE", "B00005BCKG", "B001AMHNKW", "B00BX8PG4S", "B00A92MD8G", "B0001906VS", "B00BAXTY7G"], "bought_together": ["B00BTYRB58", "B004SUDQ8G"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00BTYRB58", "0375726403", "B008220DGE", "B00320J6WS"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 13111}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 5.99, "brand": "HBO HOME VIDEO", "asin": "B0009W5IMO", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51KyOSp2TGL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Empire Falls"}

{"description": "Nobody Knows, an extraordinary film from Japanese director Kore-Eda Hirokazu, is a heartbreaking and touching story about how selfish a single mother can be to her four children, and how resilient children can be. Kicked out of several apartments for her large brood, Keiko (Japanese pop star You) sneaks them in to a new one (two inside the suitcases) and goes over the house rules: No loud noises. They must stay hidden inside the apartment all day, every day. Only Akira, the oldest, leaves to do grocery shopping while she works. He also makes dinner while Keiko goes out on dates (implying to her children that she's looking for a rich husband so that they can all live in a big house together).One day, Keiko (not a villain, but an unsympathetic, helium-voiced child herself) announces she's going away for a few weeks to work. She soon emerges every few months, only to drop off money before taking off again, at one point, for good. Akira forgoes any normal 12-year-old's upbringing (even school) to play mother, father, even Santa Claus to his siblings. There's a trapped feeling inNobody Knows. For the younger kids, it's the inability to escape to the outside world. For Akira, it's seeing the outside world and knowing he has too many responsibilities to participate in it--when he tries, the results are disastrous. As the children grow up and resources become more scarce, the film's tenacity to show every painful detail of their existence slows the pace to almost a standstill. Still, it's a lovely, haunting tale beset with unforced performances from its young actors, particularly Yagira, who won the best actor prize at Cannes. --Ellen A.

{"description": "The smartest high school drama sinceBuffy the Vampire Slayer,Veronica MarsisThe O.C.as penned by Raymond Chandler. Veronica (Kristen Bell,Deadwood) is Nancy Drew by way of Lauren Bacall, while Neptune makes Peyton Place look like Mayberry. The first season begins in the aftermath of a dizzying array of cataclysmic events: Her best friend, Lilly (Amanda Seyfried), was murdered, her sheriff father was fired over his handling of the case, she was sexually assaulted, and her mother left. Since then, Keith Mars (Enrico Colantoni,Just Shoot Me) has become a private eye and drafted Veronica as his assistant. She may lack Buffy's physical prowess, but the \"tiny blonde one\" turns out to have a special talent for sleuthing. In the wake of her sophomore year, the popular crowd abandoned Veronica--even boyfriend Duncan (Teddy Dunn), Lilly's brother. (Hence the theme song: \"We Used to Be Friends.\") Veronica is on her own until she meets Wallace (Percy Daggs III), the only student unfamiliar with her past, unlike Duncan's sarcastic pal, Logan (Jason Dohring), one of her more ardent foes. He was Lilly's boyfriend and his father is movie star Aaron Echolls (Harry Hamlin). By the end of her junior year, Veronica and Logan will make their peace, but it won't be so easy to win over the school--let alone the town. Throughout the season, Veronica will solve several mysteries both big and small--including the murder of Lilly Kane. But a few questions remain. For instance, at the end of the season finale, Veronica opens the door to greet an unseen visitor with \"I was hoping it would be you.\" So who was it? Fortunately, UPN renewed the critically acclaimed (if ratings challenged) teen noir and that tantalizing question will be answered in the second season premiere.--Kathleen C.

{"description": "The question facing any viewer of the Japanese CG featureFinal Fantasy VII: Advent Childrenis: do you have to know the games on which it&#x92;s based in order to understand the film? And the answer is: it certainly helps. But even complete novices (i.e., most parents) in theFinal Fantasyworld will find some entertainment in its wealth of fantasy-based action, and the animation never fails to astonish. Picking up two years after an epic battle between the forces of good (represented by brooding soldier Cloud) and evil (Cloud&#x92;s former general, Sephiroth),FFVIIopens in the devastated city of Midgard, whose youthful occupants suffer from a ghastly disease known as Geostigma. A trio of brothers arrives with what appears to be a cure for the plague, but their gesture conceals a more sinister purpose: to revive Sephiroth and bring about the end of the world. Cloud and his companions must once again rise to the occasion to stop the siblings and the revived Sephiroth from unleashing total destruction. Complex and self-referential to the point of occasional incomprehension,Final Fantasy VIIwill definitely be most appreciated by fans of the game series, but if others can look past the numbing dialogue and frenetic action (which is a bit too intense for very young children), the film offers a carefree and action-packed viewing experience. The two-disc set contains the original Japanese language version of the film as well as an English-dubbed edition (Rachel Leigh Cook and Christy Carlson Romano, among others, provide the vocal talent) and a version edited for the Venice Film Festival. A 30-minute featurette that recaps theFinal Fantasystory up toVII, as well as a making-of documentary, deleted scenes, and promotions for futureFinal Fantasy VIIgames and products round out the extras.--Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00003CY5D", "B000FDOTIQ", "B0007OY31G", "B00000JRSB", "B0014X7SQ6", "B008H6GHL0", "B001I9XOQO", "B0010358CQ", "B000QXDFQM", "B00005V1XW", "B00005TNI6", "B001TD6SN0", "B000XYBIKO", "B009AVC922", "B000LOAQNQ", "B001JTADR6", "074401543X", "1566867142", "B0000296O5", "B00ENNBZ68", "B00008URUA", "B001CMIUYS", "B002I0GXWO", "B008H6GH8I", "0744010241", "B00005LOXE", "0804162867", "B003IFVKM6", "6304493681", "B000KF0P1Y", "B000FQ2DTA", "B00002R28C", "B000FS2VZO", "B00008RUYZ", "B004JPJHMY", "B002U6CJO2", "B0009A4EVM", "B000AO8CH4", "B0012Z5UM0", "B0047WMHGC", "B0001O3YA8", "B00003CXBK", "B005H0OEJ6", "B000GABOTU", "B004DMIISM", "162692032X", "B00005NG6U", "B00AO075UY", "B000Y53HH4", "B005NQ5LLE", "B00EZ227X2", "B001GXI4LM", "B002I0GZ5Y", "B004L6Y0T6", "B001G3B0HC", "B00005V4XG", "B00KN16YHO", "B001OQCVI8", "0767802454", "B002MIK0TE", "B000R37S00", "B00BY0G0YU", "B00009WAUH", "0307468372", "B005I65NBW", "B00GHJX8W0", "B008SBZD5U", "B000F6ZIFQ", "0316401196", "B001C4ZQEI", "B000CDGVOO", "B002FVPFUC", "B00004TC6E", "B004COLCK2", "B00005JNJV", "B000NDRNMM", "B00GOT13BQ", "B00004Y57G", "B0045U4U52", "B001TD6SK8", "B0002A2S26", "B002S4DOA4", "B0036BDQ88", "B0013FID78", "B007NU542O", "B000NPTOTK", "B0071LEH14", "1421500493", "B0010YOQIW", "B002O3Z50Q", "B003F3NEAC", "B00829H3E2", "B000BKSJ52", "B00356GVRW", "0744000416", "B000CDGVOE"], "bought_together": ["B00003CY5D", "B0007OY31G"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00C3MKCF6", "B0029XFQF0", "B004LWZW4M", "B004DMIIVO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 25738}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.64, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B000AMJG4Y", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51J3SJW6H0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Final Fantasy VII - Advent Children (Two-Disc Special Edition)"}

{"description": "A regular program on WGBH Boston from 1963 to 1972,The French Chefis perhaps best known for its down-to-earth hostess Julia Child with her dry wit and practical approach to \"fancy\" French cooking.   Eighteen classic programs, in black and white and color, feature the ever-practical Julia Child educating viewers in everything from starters and side dishes like braised spinach, shirred eggs, and hollandaise sauce, to main courses like seafood cr&ecirc;pes and braised goose, to breads and desserts like croissants and the exotic g&acirc;teau in a cage.   Julia Child leads viewers step-by-step through each recipe, imploring budding chefs to use their fingers and hands, let go of their fear of failure, avoid a sense of panic and maintain a sense of humor so that neither the cook nor the souffl&eacute; collapses.  Helpful tips include advice about preparing dishes ahead of time, how to save a recipe gone awry, and an ever-present sense of humor that includes a waving goose and more than a few chuckles from Julia Child at her own inevitable bloopers.   While current recommendations about food safety may necessitate altering some suggestions like defrosting a goose in the sink for 4 hours and modern dietary guidelines might frown upon the use of pork back fat in a terrine or p&acirc;t&eacute;, the majority of these recipes can easily be prepared without alteration today.  If you love French food and want to learn how to prepare it yourself, join Julia Child for 18 lessons that are sure to have you cooking up exotic dishes in no time.--Tami Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0006VXMHG", "0307593908", "B00821N876", "B000HEWGXI", "B00BCV3HAQ", "B002TLRG5A", "B00009WO95", "B00066FBSE", "B00393SFP2", "037571006X", "B006BMJQ42", "0307593525", "0375711856", "0679747656", "B0056031UU", "0394480716", "0375413405", "1400043468", "0375411518", "0394401522", "B002RSDW80", "0517064855", "0307277690", "0688146570", "0307473414", "0394721772", "B000AOEPN4", "B00009V3KJ", "B000LXHJZA", "B007F7QSES", "0375404317", "B002IF7PDU", "0307272222", "1419702750", "0394532643", "B001HQ8RLK", "030729045X", "B000AOEPMK", "0679438963", "038548335X", "B00AK2Z61Q", "0394502000", "B00CP4Y5SC", "031604251X", "B002RSDW8A", "B000BNTMJQ", "B00067BC9U", "B00180IPR6", "0307948382", "047178737X", "B001KK2NDQ", "B000AOEPMU", "B003F3B4HC", "039450710X", "B000F7CDXU", "B000E8M0WY", "0307718344", "1584796677", "1439571856", "0762783095", "0375403361", "B002TCRQ68", "0684833581", "B002BI4JEM", "1452113432", "B0019LLEWC", "1419701770", "1770500235", "0618138927", "1439163529", "0547232799", "1552859487", "B007NZQSD8", "B0034BW92O", "1607742675", "0500516928", "0811874095", "0312642172", "B00004RDDR", "B00F1BFRA6", "0778802566", "1558327495", "B003VA3JTK", "0385488416", "B00AIZ2K78"], "bought_together": ["B0006VXMHG", "0307593908"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0006VXMHG", "0307593908", "B00821N876", "B00009WO95"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 32661}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 19.11, "brand": "WGBH BOSTON VIDEO", "asin": "B000BKDO7A", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51CBEGXGPTL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The French Chef With Julia Child 2"}
{"description": "With Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson as a pair of brazen wedding crashers, this buddy/romantic comedy milks a few big laughs from its foolproof premise. Under the direction of David Dobkin (who previously worked with Wilson onShanghai Knights), the movie ranges from bawdy romp to mushy romance, and that tonal identity crisis curtails the overall hilarity. But when the well-teamed costars are firing on all pistons with fast-paced dialogue and manic situations, belly laughs are delivered at a steady clip. Things get complicated when the guys infiltrate the family of the Treasury Secretary (Christopher Walken), resulting in a romantic pair-off between Vaughn and the congressman's oversexed daughter Gloria (Isla Fisher) while Wilson sincerely woos another daughter, Claire (Rachel McAdams), who's unhappily engaged to an Ivy League cheater (Bradley Cooper). Walken is more or less wasted in his role, but Jane Seymour and Henry Gibson make amusing appearances, and a surprise guest arrives late in the game for some over-the-top scene-stealing. It's all a bit uneven, but McAdams (considered by some to be \"the next Julia Roberts\") is a pure delight, and with enough laughs to make it easily recommended,Wedding Crasherswill likely find its place on DVD shelves alongside other flawed but enjoyable R-rated comedies that embrace a naughtier, nastier brand of humor with no need for apologies.--Jeff ShannonVince Vaughn's MoviesWhy We Love Rachel McAdamsOwen Wilson's MoviesThe SoundtrackThe Return of Crass ComedyThe 40-Year-Old Virgin", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEFYS2M", "B000ELJAEM", "B00466HN7M", "B008R65XNS", "B00005JNZU", "B00006FMUW", "B000J4P9P8", "B002ZGW92E", "B001G5T6GW", "B000WZEZGI", "B002Q4VBPQ", "B00003CXSM", "B001TUZD8O", "B000HCPS94", "B001C0JCBA", "B0009HBPN0", "B001OD4S50", "B00005JMYI", "B00005JG6N", "B004EPZ084", "B0015I2RT8", "B00AEFYAMA", "B00AEBB8NS", "B00AEFXJS6", "B000069CF0", "B000TZJBPQ", "B00003CXO1", "B001C5LLQ4", "B0009OL7Z4", "B0007RT9M6", "B00005JMW7", "B001J9KJ4I", "B0006GANPA", "B003Y5H574", "B000BKJ762", "B000E6EHE0", "B003Y5H524", "B000ICM5X0", "B00AEFY7I2", "B002K0WBXW", "B00AEBB9K0", "B000VXWX7E", "B0013D8LHC", "B004HO6I2E", "B001DPHDB0", "B0016MOV92", "B00AEFYM2S", "B004EPZ070", "B000JJ4DNW", "B003CRM6PA", "B00BEIYMZ6", "B008R65XMO", "B00005JMX6", "B00AEBBA2C", "B004EPZ06G", "B004EPYZS0", "B003Y5H5B0", "B00024JC4E", "B0000AKCKI", "B000957O82", "B00AEFYQE2", "B00DV2MVWO", "B00AEBB8FQ", "B001L9EXTS", "B0041KKYGU", "B00AEFZ3XU", "B002U4UYZA", "B000CPH9PM", "B000EMGJAO", "B000M341QE", "B008R65XUQ", "B00005JMCT", "B001AKTZW8", "B00008WJD6", "B00AEFYSL8", "B002P413IC", "B00AEFXVW0", "B002ZG99H2", "B0000A02TZ", "B005LAII12", "B001SN78JO", "B008JFUORW", "B000LC3ICE", "B002T9H2LA", "B0051MKNRC", "B003HKN52U", "B000CCBCAS", "B00AEFYZCU", "B002ZG980U", "B00AEFY99O", "B002VWNIEA", "B0000524E5", "B004AV5GX6", "B000A343RI", "B000EMGJ7C", "B004LWZW5G", "B00AEFXDO6", "B00000K3UU", "B004SIP95G", "B0009RCPUW"], "bought_together": ["B00AEFYS2M"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00466HN7M", "B001G5T6GW", "B003Y5H5B0", "B000J4P9P8"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 92528}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.95, "brand": "New Line Home Video", "asin": "B000BKVQRU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Z2E7093FL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Wedding Crashers (R-Rated Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "A sweet and silly story that becomes increasingly poignant as the minutes tick by,Saint Ralphis the fictional tale of a wayward 9th grader, Ralph (Adam Butcher), who is secretly living on his own while his widowed, hospitalized mother remains immersed in a coma. Frequently in trouble with Father Fitzpatrick (Gordon Pinsent), the principal of his all-boys, Catholic school, Ralph is considered something of a joke among peers until he decides to pull off the miracle that could save his mother, i.e., winning the Boston Marathon. Coached by a younger priest and former runner, Father Hibbert (Campbell Scott), whose cynicism has been lifted by the boy's pure hope, Ralph applies himself to his unlikely mission, fending off naysayers and getting help along a very challenging path from sundry allies and friends. A touching movie featuring a startlingly knowing performance from the young lead. Jennifer Tilly and Tamara Hope co-star, and the film was written and directed by Michael McGowan (My Dog Vincent).--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000AP04GK", "B000FEB9DS", "B000068MC2", "B00DX88ISM", "B001GWUHNQ", "B001CIOCNU", "B000BCKFSE", "B004FQX5A2", "B0071PT92C", "B00H2FEXXG", "B00005U7SG", "B001E75PJ4", "B00003CXPD", "B00CZNSGDS", "B00005JLR8", "B005BE79X6", "B00B0LKT9U", "B00514JK06", "B005EIY0PO", "B001D11A72", "B00000ILEC", "1937715191", "B0001AP0MW", "B0007N19X2", "B00006JMQ4", "B000R7G6H2", "B00FPVGWY2", "B0062VL4QA", "B004XVMCQM", "1425932908", "B00008DDVT", "6305784817", "B00022R9BE", "1490387552", "B00CLF821Q", "0307389642", "B008I6VSFO", "161519102X", "B001LRTTCG", "B0077ATSSQ", "B000XBPDZ8", "1891369903", "B001BL96Y8", "B00005JNC5", "B0036TGT8Y", "B0076YFJJA", "B0032LV4LI", "B00004TJKJ", "B000FTCLSA", "1609619323", "0762773987", "B00116VG3M", "B00006ADFQ", "B0009XRZS8", "B00AEFY4TO", "B000BNTMFK", "B002VWNIBI", "B003VE9WTW", "B00GPWEPZ8", "B002J6ZJKE", "B00009MEBQ", "B000PAAJW4", "B0032LV4KY", "B0087IT8FK", "1594867313", "B000Z8GZYW", "B00G15MDI0", "B00H91LVLA", "0873229592", "B00133KFGW", "B00BEIYGK2", "B005S9EJ14", "B0007ZEOPK", "B004SIP8W0", "B003UESJH4", "B00004W221", "B005TTEFXK", "6305144168", "B008GFZWRW"], "bought_together": ["B000AP04GK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000AP04GK", "B00CZNSGDS", "B00005JLR8", "B004FQX5A2"]}, "price": 10.86, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 24620}, "asin": "B000BMY2LK", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515HGZ6YCPL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Saint Ralph"}

{"description": "A dimly remembered 1994 series that lasted a scant 19 episodes may not seem like a good candidate for DVD release, butAll-American Girldeserves a second look. For Margaret Cho fans, this was the series that helped the diva of the disenfranchised find her comedic voice. For sitcom buffs, this series' tumultuous history is a textbook cautionary tale. And for actual fans of the show, it will be fun to be reunited with the wisecracking, TV-addicted Grandma (Amy Hill), the series' breakout character.All-American Girlwas created as a showcase for stand-up comedian Cho, and was the first primetime series to feature a Korean family. But network interference took its toll on Cho's health (she recalls in one of the episode commentaries that she was compelled to crash-diet after being informed by execs that \"I was too fat to play myself\") and the show's creative direction, dulling Cho's cutting edge.Set in San Francisco,All-American Girlis a culture clash/generation gap comedy. Cho's free-spirited Valley Girlish Margaret works at a department store and lives with her tradition-bound bookseller parents (Clyde Kusatsu, Jodi Long); her Grandma; brother Stuart (B.D. Wong), a successful doctor; and her younger, assimilated brother, Eric (J.B. Quon). Margaret's relationship with her imperious mother is particularly adversarial. The show seemed to be finding its footing when it was canceled, and some episodes offer a tantalizing glimpse of what might have been had the show's creators been left alone. \"Pulp Sitcom\" is a clever homage toPulp Fiction, complete with a guest-star appearance by Quentin Tarantino as a purveyor of bootleg videos. \"The Apartment\" spoofs MTV'sThe Real Worldas Margaret shares an apartment with her two co-workers, one of whom (comedian Judy Gold) has a penchant for walking around nude. The show took a fleetingSeinfeld-ian turn with \"Take My Family, Please,\" in which Margaret performs a stand-up routine about her family, who are in the audience and are not amused. In solo episode commentaries and in an on-camera conversation with Amy Hill, Cho thoughtfully reflects on whereAll-American Girlsucceeded and why it ultimately failed. But her through-the-Hollywood-looking-glass experience inspired her breakout performance piece, the highly recommendedI'm the One That I Want, in which she chronicles the series' demise much more candidly and graphically. This is the unexpurgated Margaret we know and love.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B005MQ58RC", "B000RO8PPQ", "B002KLQ31C", "B00005ML8T", "B00005JLL1", "B0002CHJKU", "B000A2UBPM", "B000EQ5PTQ", "B00IA7MFEO", "B001LRL4WY", "B00005JOXR", "B002NN7EYM", "B0002I84FS", "B0002CHJHS", "B007K7IAGM", "B008L0YMWS", "B00008AOTD", "B000FL7CB4", "B008HUSFO8", "B00JL6L4WC", "B003LXM1PK", "B002XJDUX0", "B008JBJAM6", "B0056GLNQI", "B0001JXP2A", "B006YTGL86", "B000E33VYU", "B001P9N9B2", "B0001EFV7M", "B00B2PVPFG", "B000BY9FTW", "B000ABKHZC", "B0055SNHQ6", "B00008PHCU", "B001NY6YQG", "B000286RO8", "B0002Y4TB0", "B000F7CMSG", "B00HNGC56G", "B000A7Q1YC", "B0000WN15E", "B0072BNKHA", "B000B5XOW0", "B006YGCEPS", "B006CR2OWM", "B000001ZGA", "B00EYA6VF0", "B00005JNIS", "B009LDD3I8", "B0028S110A", "B0018RKEQE"], "bought_together": ["B005MQ58RC", "B002KLQ31C"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00B1LM730", "B001FCD252", "B005MQ58RC", "B008HHB84K"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 46701}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 18.98, "brand": "Universal Music", "asin": "B000BXJ1Y2", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51e%2BB16dRIL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "All American Girl - The Complete Series"}

{"description": "One of the year's most highly praised pictures, Jia Zhangke's ravishing epic opens in a rush of color and sound. Here's young China in action, optimistic and bursting with life. First there's yelling (for a badly-needed Band-Aid), then music--gurgling synths atop a pan-ethnic beat--as the sequin and feather-bedecked performers of the \"Five Continents\" company take the stage of the real-life World Park. As the ads say, \"See the world without ever leaving Beijing,\" and 106 of the globe&#x92;s major sites are recreated in miniature, like a third-scale Eiffel Tower and mini-Lower Manhattan--complete with Twin Towers. Doll-faced Tao (Tao Zhao), ever-present cell phone in hand, is at the center of the maelstrom. Her boyfriend, Taisheng (Taisheng Chen), is a security guard with a sideline in fake IDs (and infidelity). When some Russian guest workers join the troupe, Tao's increasingly insular world briefly expands. She and Anna (Alla Shcherbakova) don't speak the same language, but do what they can to communicate. Tao envies her new friend&#x92;s \"freedom\"--she's never been beyond China's borders--unaware that Anna's nomadic existence is by necessity rather than choice. When she finds that Anna has become an escort, Tao's world snaps back to its previous dimensions, ultimately shrinking down to nothing.The Worldis unambiguously ambitious, with elaborate dance sequences, animated text messages, and tragic subplots. Unlike 2000'sPlatform, Zhangke's fourth feature isn't set in the past or the provinces, but he surpasses that success with his finest--and most cynical--film to date.--Kathleen C.

{"description": "A sterling cast and vivid direction giveNorth Countryan emotional heft to match its political convictions. Charlize Theron (Monster) plays Josey Aimes, who goes to work at a Minnesota steel mine after splitting with her violent husband.Frances McDormand and CharlizeTheron inNorth Country.But the job proves to be almost as harrowing as her marriage; the male miners, resentful of women taking jobs, verbally abuse and play humiliating pranks on the female miners. After being physically assaulted by a coworker, Josey tries to fight against the harassment, but none of the other women will join her case for fear that things will only get worse.North Country, directed by Niki Caro (Whale Rider), makes the women's experience palpable for the audience without overdoing it. But the lawsuit is only part of the movie; the gut impact ofNorth Countrycomes from the devastating effect the lawsuit has on Josey's family, friends, and coworkers--thanks to an incredible ensemble cast that includes Sissy Spacek (In the Bedroom), Sean Bean (Lord of the Rings), Richard Jenkins (Six Feet Under), Woody Harrelson (The People vs. Larry Flynt), and the always powerful Frances McDormand (Fargo,Mississippi Burning). The courtroom histrionics don't always ring true, but the family conflict is riveting and deeply moving.

{"description": "Those looking for titillation from this droll observation of the sociological impact of one of the most notorious porn films of all time will probably be disappointed. Broadcast on British television in 2005,Debbie Does Dallas Uncovered(originally known asThe Curse of Debbie Does Dallas) is nonetheless a good-natured little documentary along the lines ofInside Deep Throatthat takes a fun, matter-of-fact look at the adult film industry in one of its early incarnations (the 1970s). The film attempts to uncover the \"mystery\" of starlet Bambi Woods who made only a few other appearances in porn before disappearing into obscurity. It also explores the mob angle and some of the dangers associated with organized crime and the FBI's interest once porn became more lucrative and mainstream. More entertaining is the sense of nostalgia that comes through in the modern-day interviews with those who participated in the making and marketing ofDebbie, and how a micro-budget movie that by all rights should have quickly faded away became a huge hit and icon of porn. Smart, gray-haired paunchy guys watching themselves perform with 30 years' perspective seem bemused, wistful, and maybe a little bit embarrassed about the wacky way they made a few bucks (only one ofDebbie's original actresses agreed to be interviewed). The film takes no moral stance, even though many of the interview subjects speak seriously about the victimization that has always gone hand-in-hand with the adult entertainment business. While not as clever, insightful, or stylish asInside Deep Throat,Debbie Does Dallasis still an engaging glimpse at a tawdry time and place that produced a classic in the annals of the adult film history. As an interesting extra and counterpoint to the history lesson, the disc includes the bonus feature,Diary of a Porn Virgin, which documents the tale of two women who make dramatic career changes into the modern porn industry.--Ted Fry", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00C7D26VE", "B000A1INIU", "B000CFX7DK", "B006OT0UUQ", "B0009HMTV2", "B000TXPXAU", "B00AKLLSNC", "B000FBFZ3Q", "B002KECJZI", "B000CFX7DU"], "bought_together": ["B00C7D26VE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00C7D26VE", "B00AKLLSNC", "B00B022GVS", "B00FB349R6"]}, "price": 17.08, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 148038}, "asin": "B000CRR3GK", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51QXG5WM6JL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Debbie Does Dallas Uncovered"}

{"description": "IfNight Stalkerhad been given a chance to establish its own identity, this \"reimagining\" of the popularearly '70s TV moviesmight have thrived. Instead, many viewers perceived the short-lived series as a thinly disguisedX-Filesspinoff, with formerX-Filesproducer Frank Spotnitz apparently hired to recycleX-Filesplots in a slightly different format. That's not necessarily a bad thing, since the series boasts superior production values and dark, sometimes violent horror plots as effectively creepy as anything seen onX-Files. But fans of the original (both TV movies and 1974 series) bristled at ABC's obvious youth-market makeover that turned Darren McGavin's original \"Carl Kolchak\" from a cynical, sarcastic middle-aged reporter on the fringes of journalism into a hip, handsome, Mustang-driving young reporter (played by Irish actor Stuart Townsend) who's literally marked for death in what was intended (if the series had survived) to be an epic battle of good vs. evil. By pairing Kolchak with an equally young, attractive, and skeptical colleague named Perri Reed (Gabrielle Union), the series struggled to find its place among such popular shows asMediumand theCSIjuggernaut, and there just wasn't enough originality to keep viewers interested. Ratings plummeted after the pilot premiered on September 29, 2005, and of the ten episodes produced and included here, only six were broadcast before the show's inevitable cancellation.As Spotnitz conceived it (with severalX-Filesveterans serving as directors or consulting producers),Night Stalkerrevolved around an epic \"mythology\" that would've emerged had the series continued. Spotnitz outlines these broader details in his smart, informative DVD commentaries, allowing viewers a greater appreciation of how the series was being planned. As it stands, the new Kolchak is striving to solve the violent, monstrous attack that killed his wife, and his ongoing investigations draw him deeper into supernatural events, mostly explored in episodes so similar toX-Filesthat you could easily exchange Kolchak and Reed for agents Mulder and Scully and barely notice the difference. From their high-rise offices at the Los Angeles Beacon (beautifully filmed in high-def digital video), Kolchak and Reed solve brutal murders, bizarre deaths, and other mysteries with the help of photographer Jain McManus (Eric Jungman) and editor Tony Vincenzo (Cotter Smith), while a cynical FBI agent (semi-regular cast member John Pyper-Ferguson) suspects Kolchak of killing his wealthy wife to inherit her estate. As these 10 episodes demonstrate, the hard-won trust between Kolchak and Reed would become the series' emotional anchor, with Townsend and Union establishing an appealing chemistry that served the series well.Unfortunately,Night Stalkerwas doomed from the start. The series was cancelled in the midst of a two-part episode, leaving viewers with an unresolved cliffhanger and unanswered questions about the mysterious \"four horsemen of the apocalypse\" biker gang that's been a looming threat throughout these episodes. Thanks to Spotnitz's detailed commentaries and video interview included on this two-disc set (along with printable DVD-ROM scripts from unproduced episodes), these and other mysteries are tantalizingly explained, and these tenNight Stalkerepisodes stand as testament to a high-quality series that never had a chance to prove its long-term potential.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000ATQYWY", "B0037AGB9O", "B0051GOB2G", "B000FJH5M2", "B000N3T0EG", "B000FS9MY2", "B003PGNBO8", "B001QE99BA", "B002QU1Z1K", "B0012IX35S", "B000FOPPBA", "B004XM38CS", "B00026L7OU", "B0002S94BQ", "B001RXDM2M", "B000E5N6B6", "B000QUEQ4U", "B002DQSKME", "B00BHLTIXQ", "B008I34YOO", "B001A7GOCA", "B0007CEXUY", "B002TQKL7A", "B0055SNHQG", "B00KTZALDC", "B000KF0DDY", "B000A9QKT6", "B008B4KVRE", "B00LLTY4M4", "B004YPED14", "B00404ME2E", "B00LPY2I1E", "B000FIHN8O", "B0081QF6Q8", "B007G4X7VC", "B004P7CNVS", "B000ELL1QC", "B003LXM1PK", "B0010TDRP0", "B0056GLNQI", "B0011FLH00", "B0006J27WO", "B00F3L8P26", "B00KO72WNC", "B000CEV3MI", "B00ECXJC28", "B000ATQYXI", "B000JLTRHW", "B00CRX82LM", "B0012IXBNC", "B00JF5GAZA", "B002U0KHME", "B0038MUZ3E", "B00170LCWC", "B000E8JO2S", "B003R0MEYA", "B009ERK2UI", "B00344EAG4", "B00013D54Y", "B00007AJE1", "B00023BKMC", "B006TBYC76", "B0006UEVUE", "B000FUTVPA", "B000MMMTD2", "B003LXM1B4", "B00GTZWZH6", "B004QOB8TS", "B00465I156", "B002H6NVM4", "B004HHX9T6", "B002FG9N50", "B000SMNL92", "B00B04NIZO", "B002FLOTPO", "B001CQONOA", "B007MDB6UQ", "B009LDD5XQ", "B004LROMS4", "B002DLB1H0", "B001CQONMC", "B0002CX1M0", "B00E5G03J8", "B00BD6K54G", "B001KEGR5W", "B001DXS4DI", "B008HSK3PE", "B00DPJEWD4", "B00000FA91", "B008H1Q61G", "B003NOGNQU", "B003H9LIU2", "B00005JN8Q", "B000FJH5MC", "B005GYXN2M", "B00IKM5N1G", "B0025KVKDO", "B0009JE6G6", "B000HEVZ94", "B0009JE6FM"], "bought_together": ["B000ATQYWY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000ATQYWY", "B00026L7OU", "B0051GOB2G", "B000FFJZO2"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 19972}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 10.39, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B000EOTV98", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5147K6AC32L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Night Stalker - The Complete Series"}

And as the frightened teenager goes upstairs to check on the children, Jill's quiet night of babysitting is about to turn into a nerve-shattering nightmare of suspense, horror and dread.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001AV3BWM", "B00151QYOO", "B002ZG99IG", "B00AEFXSLE", "B0021L8UYY", "B001D2WU9I", "B000RGN2JI", "B000E1ZBIG", "B0021L8UPS", "B000NO3DLG", "B00275EHDM", "B000OVLBGM", "B000AM4P9K", "B00174RCHW", "B001U0HBQA", "B00AEFYYH6", "6305137382", "B00005RYKU", "B000PMLJMQ", "B000MM0LIM", "B00005JOWW", "6305017115", "B00AEBBA2W", "B002DKGWSE", "B002CAWNEM", "B004B3PBFQ", "B0006SGYL0", "B0026LQM2Q", "B002LMSWN2", "B004LWZW2O", "B00111YM5Q", "B000A5045Q", "B00AUPSR14", "B002JT69IW", "B0021L8UFI", "B000TSIJWY", "B00BM4Q4H6", "B0009X763M", "B0021L8UXA", "B0013LL2YS", "B000CCBC9O", "B000J4QW7W", "B000AA4JL6", "B003L20IEW", "B0002WT4OE", "B002USF1WC", "B000BVM1S2", "B00003CXUP", "B00006HAWN", "B000KX0IP4", "B005LAIHCM", "B00092ZLSK", "B00AJLHUA8", "B0031U8OEK", "B001JV5BIA", "B002AMVEII", "B0000541TL", "B0009MWELW", "B001NPD9LS", "B004SIP9MY", "B00005JNY3", "B002ZG971U", "B001KEHAEO", "B00B96TGQS", "B000KJU1KK", "B001MVYUR0", "B004SIP92O", "B00008LUNW", "B001JNNDJM", "B004P7CN7W", "B00AEJM61I", "B009XTF8KQ", "0767824954", "B004SIP9O2", "B000069CF9", "B004LWZW24", "B0019X3YX2", "B00BEIYGT8", "B000I2J736", "B000083C6I", "B003H9LIRA", "B00AIBZLVY", "B000TJBN62", "B002E2QH7W", "B000AWYOGE", "B00005RHGK", "B00064X5L6", "B001DZOC6Y", "B00005JMDZ", "B000069DOB", "B00005JL3T", "B004AC6PV2", "B004SIP9I8", "B00IXD2MWK", "B000HC2LFI", "B0029EW7BA", "B0002C4JJ4", "B0000VCZMK", "B004P7CN3G", "B000FSME9W"], "bought_together": ["B001AV3BWM", "B00AEFXSLE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000E1ZBIG", "B00AEFXSLE", "B001AV3BWM", "B001D2WU9I"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 21078}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.55, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B000F6IOAM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/511BBXTP51L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "When a Stranger Calls"}

{"description": "What was in the Hatch? The cliffhanger from season one of Lost was answered in its opening sequences, only to launch into more questions as the season progressed. That's right: Just when you say \"Ohhhhh,\" there comes another \"What?\" Thankfully, the show's producers sprinkle answers like tasty morsels throughout the season, ending with a whopper: What caused Oceanic Air Flight 815 to crash in the first place? As the show digs into more revelations about its inhabitant's pasts, it also devotes a good chunk to new characters (Hey, it's an island; you never know who you're going to run into.) First, there are the \"Tailies,\" passengers from the back end of the plane who crashed on the other side of the island. Among them are the wise, God-fearing ex-drug lord Mr. Eko (standout Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje); devoted husband Bernard (Sam Anderson); psychiatrist Libby (Cynthia Watros, whose character has more than one hidden link to the other islanders); and ex-cop Ana Lucia (Michelle Rodriguez), by far the most infuriating character on the show, despite how much the writers tried to incur sympathy with her flashback. Then there are the Others, first introduced when they kidnapped Walt (Malcolm David Kelley) at the end of season one. Brutal and calculating, their agenda only became more complex when one of them (played creepily by Michael Emerson) was held hostage in the hatch and, quite handily, plays mind games on everyone's already frayed nerves. The original cast continues to battle their own skeletons, most notably Locke (Terry O'Quinn), Sun (Yunjin Kim) and Michael (Harold Perrineau), whose obsession with finding Walt takes a dangerous turn. The love triangle between Jack (Matthew Fox), Kate (Evangeline Lilly) and Sawyer (Josh Holloway), which had stalled with Sawyer's departure, heats up again in the second half. Despite the bloating cast size (knocked down by a few by season's end) Lost still does what it does best: explores the psyche of people, about whom \"my life is an open book\" never applies, and cracks into the social dynamics of strangers thrust into Lord of the Flies-esque situations. Is it all a science experiment? A dream? A supernatural pocket in the universe? Likely, any theory will wind up on shaky ground by the season's conclusion. But hey, that's the fun of it. This show was made for DVD, and you can pause and slow-frame to your heart's content. Just try and keep that head-spinning to a minimum.On the DVDCommentaries by various cast members and producers reveal little other than the occasional easter egg (the Dharma logo on the shark fin, Walt's mumbling translating to \"Don't push the button; the button is bad\" backwards). But disc seven opens with an eerie Hanso Foundation instructional video, leading you to eight hours of bonus features, including cast members' own theories, deleted scenes, and featurettes on specific episodes. It's all well and good for Lost fanatics, but if you want the cream of the crop, check out: \"Lost Connections,\" an interactive feature that reveals how all the islanders are actually linked (for instance, one of the officers who captured Sayid during the Gulf War is Kate's father); a Channel UK promo for the show directed by David LaChappelle in which cast members suck in their cheeks and, dressed in evening wear, tango in slow motion as if in a Calvin Klein ad (it has to be a joke, right?); and \"The World According to Sawyer,\" which strings together each of the un-PC nicknames and pop culture references spewed by Holloway's character. Favorites include \"Chewie\" for Jin and \"Ponce de Leon\" for Ana Lucia. It's by far the cherry on top of a sweet dessert. --Ellen A.

Luckily for me, there were tv movies on fairly regularly in the vein of Tarantulas: The Deadly Cargo. I remember watching this movie on tv, even the specific scenes with the spiders in the burlap coffee bags (and I always look twice at bags of un-ground coffee too) on the plane and the ending. The combination of television stars, action writing, and hairy-legged spiders actually is quite satisfying for me, even as a grown-up.

{"description": "From the creators ofSouth Park,That's My Bushis two--two!--parodies in one. Matt Stone and Trey Parker take aim at both President George W. Bush and the two-camera sitcom. (Not necessarily in that order.) The acting is over-the-top, the laugh track is on steroids, and George (Timothy Bottoms,The Last Picture Show) is more dopey husband than dopey leader. He even has his own Ralph Kramden-like catch phrase: \"One of these days, Laura, I'm gonna punch you in the face!\" Laura Bush (Carrie Quinn Dolin) is the brains behind the marriage, while Karl Rove (Kurt Fuller,Auto Focus) is the brains behind the Oval Office. The West Wing is rounded out by sexy secretary Princess (Kristen Miller), sassy housekeeper Maggie (Marcia Wallace,The Bob Newhart Show), and wacky neighbor Larry (John D'Aquino). ThoughThat's My Bush!may sound like liberal propaganda, Stone and Parker throw darts at the Left, too, like the surly pro-choice activist in the pilot (\"An Aborted Dinner Date\").That's My Bush!ran for eight episodes, all pre-9/11, before Comedy Central pulled the plug, citing cost concerns rather than low ratings. Topics tackled include the death penalty, gun control, and the war on drugs. If the humor isn't always as \"gut-busting\" as its writers, including Tony Barbieri (Windy City Heat), seem to think, the show provides Bottoms with one of his best roles. Next to Homer Simpson and Al Bundy, it's hard to imagine a more hapless hubbie. This two-disc collection includes mini-commentaries (a few minutes a pop) from Stone, Parker, and the entire cast on each episode.--Kathleen C.

{"description": "ThisM*A*S*H-tastic 36-disc collection is one for the television time capsule. It contains all 11 seasons of this multi-Emmy Award-winning series, PLUS Robert Altman's 1970 iconoclastic anti-war classic, PLUS two discs of special features, including two reunion specials and a series retrospective episode of A&E;'sBiography. As with the individual season sets, there are no new episode commentaries, a major disappointment. ButM*A*S*H-ophiles will enjoy this set's other bonus features, including emotional behind-the-scenes footage of the filming of the last half-hour episode, \"As Time Goes By,\" the inevitable bloopers, interviews with cast members as well as fans about their favorite episodes, a segment about the series' \"Jocularity,\" a parade of PSAs (cut down on salt to avoid heart disease), and the text of an unproduced script penned by Alda for an episode titled, \"Hawkeye on the Double.\" All of this material (except for a commemorative booklet) is available elsewhere in different configurations, but this space-saving (albeit ungainly packaged) box set collects them all under one tent.Adapted for television by legendary comedy writer Larry Gelbart, the series has long since supplanted Altman's film in the public's consciousness. Life and death at a Mobile Army Surgical Hospital during the Korean War doesn't seem like ripe fodder for a comedy series, butM*A*S*Hmasterfully balanced laughter and tears (less so in its later, more preachy seasons). It often does play better without a laugh track (a viewing option for all episodes). During its run,M*A*S*Hsurvived several delicate operations, including the departure of Gelbart after season 4 and the loss of core ensemble members McLean Stevenson as Col. Henry Blake and Wayne Rogers as Trapper John (after season 3), Larry Linville as Frank Burns (after season 5) and Gary Burghoff (a veteran of the original film) as Radar (after season 8). The show thrived with the introduction of some new blood, Henry Morgan as \"regular Army\" Col.

But a special salute to Loretta Switt, whose Margaret Houlihan went from \"Hot Lips\" to nobody's pushover. From the \"Pilot\" to the feature-length finale, \"Goodbye, Farewell & Amen,\" still the most-watched episode in history, this essential (but not so much if you bought the individual season sets) collection honors one of television's greatest half-hours.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000OT6V1E", "B003JV0ITA", "B00BMJ7ZKG", "B002L9N4O2", "B001IXXYCE", "B003JUVXE0", "0688149553", "B001DHXT48", "B00251EP26", "B008P9M614", "B0050MB5AC", "B000HLDFA4", "B0024HH32A", "B001E0O8DA", "B005SQRYS2", "B008HUSFTS", "B00011KM3I", "B00E8AVN9U", "B001DMVZJ4", "B004SGWYXS", "B000H5U5EE", "B004YOEECS", "B002PQ7JR4", "B00EIJTLK4", "B001DSNEME", "B00CRVL5ZE", "B003WVJ65Y", "B000V3JGIS", "B009DA74BG", "B00DXLO0D6", "B001DMVZJO", "B000MGBSEY", "B001DZOCZU", "B005F96UP0", "B000QFCDAY", "B00DYQ1G78", "B001FBV4T4", "B00HRUQB5O", "B00CD45JBG", "B0000BV1XX", "B00E5G03I4", "B00GSTHCHQ", "B00DXLO086", "B002LFPAUC", "B00FEP9MYG", "B000XJD3JS", "B000EHRVOW", "6305212112", "B009Z59ZNE", "B000XKW45Q", "B000Y5JFNE", "B001LXIDVI", "B00003CXRM", "B001FB4VXU"], "bought_together": ["B000OT6V1E", "B00BMJ7ZKG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00BMJ7ZKG", "B001DMVZJ4", "B001DMVZJO", "B001DMVZJY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 10518}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 129.95, "brand": "20th Century Fox", "asin": "B000HT3P5Q", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41WASG65Q0L._SX300_.jpg", "title": "M*A*S*H - Martinis and Medicine Complete Collection"}
{"description": "Okay, let&#x92;s get one thing straight right off the bat:Family Guyis not, never has been, and never will be,The Simpsons. Nor is itSouth Park,King of the Hill, or any one of a number of other shows on Adult Swim.  But yes, it is in many ways a rip-off of those other shows (especiallyThe Simpsons; let&#x92;s not even pretend otherwise). But so what? By now, you either think the show&#x92;s funny, or you don&#x92;t, and the derivativeness either bothers you, or it doesn&#x92;t. Volume 4 is likely to just cement your feelings one way or the other, because this collection features some of the funniest, and the most offensive material yet. It&#x92;s also  the most cohesive. The show has always been incredibly erratic, turning on a dime to fit in all those jokes from out of the blue that start with Peter saying \"Boy, this is worse than that time when...\"  But by now, the writers and series creator/executive producer Seth MacFarlane have figured out how to more seamlessly integrate them into the show, and that&#x92;s just what it needed to really come together. In fact, the extra attention being paid to the show recently in the form of swipes fromThe Simpsonsand especiallySouth Park(which dedicated an entire episode to trying to kill offFamily Guy) is evidence that this is probably the peak for the series. This volume is 14 episodes, and stand-outs include \"The Courtship of Stewie&#x92;s Father,\" which gives more face time to creepy old man Herbert (brilliantly voiced by Mike Henry), and \"The Father, the Son, and the Holy Fonz,\" in which Peter starts his own church dedicated to Fonzie fromHappy Days. Of course, there is still the lingering question of who the real star ofFamily Guyis: Peter or Stewie? The little football-head gets his moments to shine in \"Sibling Rivalry,\" in which he battles with half-brother Bertram, and... well, pretty much every other episode, as he continues to get many of the memorable lines. Along with the extra features, over 40 deleted scenes, extensive commentaries, and featurettes, you true fans will get more than your share of laughs from this collection, which is what you watch the show for in the first place.--Daniel Vancini", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000AQ68Z0", "B000RO6JZO", "B0012018OE", "B00008YGRV", "B000083C6V", "B001VFM0ZG", "B003DZX46G", "B003L77G9W", "B0058YPMHO", "B00E0FW054", "B000A3DFV8", "B003V3FVQ6", "B00FR81Z40", "B000E6ES9O", "B002HQK5O6", "B0006B41GM", "B000NNK4DM", "B0012KSUTA", "B001RIZ7OI", "B0040JHX0W", "B001N9VW5Y", "B003L77G7Y", "B003CN5B7E", "B0053O8A32", "B002LARYTW", "B003X4KHRG", "B000YOX3HE", "B00LFW6BA0", "B00BYNL8DU", "B00A2JFNSS", "B008412UKA", "B008412UQ4", "B0058RN7KA", "B000ADWCYY", "B007ZFR67I", "B0000CABL2", "B00023P49M", "B00023P49C", "B0001ZWLVU", "B00008YGRS", "B001O0TWXG", "B000FSME2Y", "B002JVWQYG", "B000CNESM6", "B000KLQUMQ", "B0044E9JTG", "B001L1S1PI", "B007KFZ85K", "B000R7I3XC", "B0018O5WUU", "B007KFZ7UQ", "B0024FAR52", "B004MLEYTG", "B000RPD0DC", "B004696M94", "B0006Z2L2Y", "B001RP976A", "B007KFZ7PG", "B000FEBWTE", "B000ERVJNG", "B00158K0V0", "B000067DNE", "B007KFZ7YM", "B0030Y11UG", "B00HDU9UOW", "B000E0OE3K", "B000RW3VDE", "B002LASCJ8", "B000B5XOWU", "B001GQ3GHG", "B009SQ9Q5M", "B007KFZ8B4", "B000KWZ1PC", "B00DTPRZ10", "B006W93ELK", "B008AITJ7O", "B000GETU2E", "B000UZDO62", "B000ZT0S9O", "B003KZ27N0", "B00BI5YEWG", "B007KFZ87S", "B007KFZ88M", "B002C11LCG", "B0024FAR6Q", "B000F48D14", "B007Z3UUF0", "B008OTH56Q", "B0060OKO2O", "B0064ESJ18", "B007KFZ7Q0", "B0072BNK02", "B0019D151K", "B004XVMCH6", "B00GJPUXKC", "B001DZOC78", "B0019CSXAM", "B002N5N4FS", "B005QIOJUI", "B003L77G6U"], "bought_together": ["B000AQ68Z0", "B000RO6JZO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00008YGRV", "B000083C6V", "B000AQ68Z0", "B003L77G9W"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 27839}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 13.7, "brand": "Twentieth Century Fox", "asin": "B000HT3P6U", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GYVSQ1NPL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Family Guy, Volume Four"}
{"description": "If Richard Donner's 1978 feature filmSuperman: The Moviemade us believe a man could fly, Bryan Singer's 2006 follow-up,Superman Returns, lets us remember that a superhero movie can make our spirits soar. Superman (played by newcomer Brandon Routh) comes back to Earth after a futile five-year search for his destroyed home planet of Krypton. As alter ego Clark Kent, he's eager to return to his job at the Daily Planet and to see Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth). Lois, however, has moved on: she now has a fianc&#xE9; (James Marsden), a son (Tristan Leabu), and a Pulitzer Prize for her article entitled \"Why the World Doesn't Need Superman.\" On top of this emotional curveball, his old archrival Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) is plotting the biggest land grab in history.Singer, who made a strong impression among comic-book fans for his work on the X-Men franchise and directed Spacey inThe Usual Suspects, brings both a fresh eye and a sense of respect to the world's oldest superhero. He borrows John Williams's great theme music and Marlon Brando's voice as Jor-El, and the story (penned by Singer'sX-Mencollaborators Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris) is a sort-of-sequel to the first two films in the franchise (choosing to ignore that the third and fourth movies ever happened). The humorous and romantic elements give the movie a heart, Singer's art-deco Metropolis is often breathtaking, and the special effects are elegant and spectacular, particularly an early airplane-disaster set-piece. Of the cast, Routh is excellent as the dual Superman/Clark, Spacey is both droll and vicious as Luthor, and Parker Posey gets the best lines as Luthor's moll Kitty. But at 23, Bosworth seems too young for the five-years-past-grizzled Lois. It's nice to see Noel Neill, Jack Larson (both from the classicAdventures of SupermanTV series), and Eva Marie-Saint on the screen as well. Superman Returns is one of those projects that was in development for seemingly forever, but it was worth the wait -- it's the most enjoyable superhero movie sinceSpider-Man 2andThe Incredibles.--David HoriuchiMore SupermanWatch our exclusive interviews with the cast ofSuperman ReturnsOther feature filmsSuperman in high definitionSmallvilleAdventures of SupermanSee all Superman DVDs", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001DJLD2G", "B000IJ79VQ", "B000IJ79X4", "B000IJ79XE", "B000IJ79WU", "B008JFUPFI", "B000IJ79UW", "B001CDR1FG", "B000ION23U", "B002GSXKN8", "B004EPZ07K", "B0000959N0", "B00005JNTU", "B004LWZWFQ", "B001DHXT20", "B000VI70QS", "B0006L0LOS", "B0007P0Y7C", "B000UR9T8C", "B00005JNJV", "B00005JMQW", "B00005JKCH", "B000AYELVU", "B004LWZW42", "B0090SI56Y", "B001OST0LW", "B001OST0M6", "B001QB9H1U", "B000HCO83Q", "B000PE0G0A", "B001GCUO1Q", "B0002IQMAM", "B004LWZWGA", "B008JFUS0U", "B000P0J06K", "B000OVLBF8", "B00E5I2MCM", "B003YAR97K", "B001GZ6QC4", "B00080ZG2O", "B003QO8TOQ", "B001FB55HQ", "B005LAIGW8", "B000I8OM94", "B000FO0AHY", "B00IZZDWKM", "B000P0J06U", "B0007V6ITE", "B008JFUO72", "B000AYELVA", "B002NXSRVG", "B00DYEN6XC", "B00E5I2MEK", "B000BT96EG", "B001HQZJMU", "B001QTXM5Y", "B00E5I2M6I", "B002HWRYJE", "B00E5I2M9K", "B001614E68", "B000059Z8L", "B001VLBDD0", "B000EU1Q3Q", "B000EU1Q2M", "B000KJU1KK", "B00BTYMPUY", "B000H30B2C", "B001F7MSFM", "B0013BM63O", "B00F4FFO8E", "B000EGDB10", "B00008G8M5", "B00JPS7HOA", "0790738953", "B000B7QCGS", "B000HWZ4E8", "B00BBXSPES", "B000FMGTTE", "B0083SBMBM", "B003Z8ZCDO", "B005LAII44", "B000P6XQ50", "B000VI28Z6", "B00AZMFJYA", "B001RHGRT8", "B000F4RH8E", "B002ZG99B8", "B001AK3S4Y", "B00005JL78", "B0002ZMHX6", "B0007G89FU", "B006VRRGNK", "B00BBAQD6S", "B009JBWOU0", "B000BT96FA", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B00BGI086Q", "B003UN2ICM", "B0000VCZMK"], "bought_together": ["B008JFUPFI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B008JFUPFI", "B00F4FFO8E", "B001DJLD2G", "B000IJ79UW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 57565}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.73, "brand": "DC Comics", "asin": "B000J10EQU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Ddmxk8VML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Superman Returns (Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "Sweet baby Jesus, we thank you for blessing Will Ferrell and Adam McKay with the talent to create a NASCAR comedy as hilarious asTalladega Nights. The so-called \"Ballad of Ricky Bobby\" is hardly flawless  in fact it's not always firing on all cylinders  but with comedy star Ferrell and director McKay still hot from the success of their previous comedy hitAnchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy, most of this 108-minute spoof of oval-track racing is so knee-slappin' funny that you can't help but surrender to the stupidity.Obviously, Ferrell's the shining star, and his portrayal of lead-footed pit-crew-member-turned-#1 NASCAR champion Ricky \"I Wanna Go Fast\" Bobby (how can you not love that name?) is spot-on perfect, righteously spoofing the entirety of NASCAR culture without insulting its oft-ridiculed roots in redneck bootlegging of a bygone era. You could even argue that Talladega Nights is truer to NASCAR than Tom Cruise'sDays of Thunder, and it's certainly more entertaining, especially when you add John C. Reilly as Ricky's life-long pal, teammate, and eventual rival Cal Naughton, Jr. (together they're nicknamed \"Shake 'n Bake\"), and Sacha Baron Cohen (fromDa Ali G ShowandBorat) as gay French \"Formula Un\" driver-turned NASCAR rival Jean Girrard, to a stellar cast including Molly Shannon, Greg Germann, Amy Adams and Michael Clarke Duncan.Sure, it's mostly a showcase for Ferrell's loud, over-the-top antics and nonsensical non sequiturs (like cameo appearances by Elvis Costello and Mos Def), but with Ferrell behind the wheel,Talladega Nightsrolls into victory lane with fuel to spare, and there's one final bit of comedy (with a tip of the hat to William Faulkner) for those who sit through the credits. --Jeff ShannonStills fromTalladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby(click for larger image)More NASCAR andTalladega Nightsat Amazon.comThe CalendarOn blu-rayNASCAR on PSPOur NASCAR StoreNASCAR The Imax ExperienceSpeed, Guts, and GloryBookOther Will Ferrell FilmsAnchor ManElfThe Best of Will FerrellMore Films by Will Ferrell", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000WZEZFY", "B001G5T6H6", "B000HRMCTI", "B0007TS24U", "B0009K7RT8", "B00096S49O", "B000EJ9VDY", "B000KF0GSQ", "B000OVLBFI", "B000AM8RQM", "B000SH3XCM", "B00000G02A", "B001F76PDI", "B000ELL1P8", "B000A6QMQA", "B002EQFXZA", "B000L2125O", "B0009Z3LGQ", "B000ASBKHE", "B0009NSDCK", "B000FIS7HK", "B0007TFLLM", "B0012IWO08", "B002SD94AY", "B003L51GW2", "B0007V46JI", "B000ASDFGS", "B000IFRT5G", "B0008JFMEW", "B000GPVUMG", "B000AQ6904", "B002BSC57U", "B0009VCSXW", "B0008JFMF6", "B000R3BN4M", "B007M6W36Y", "B000BYRCHE", "B0009RCPV6", "B000E1YW04", "B002I0GZBI", "B0009X7BFA", "B000B5IP6U", "B0009KQOME", "B000A0GP5Y", "B000ENUYFE", "B0050JN84Q", "B000BGZRTC", "B003DS4Z6Q", "B001KMRN0M", "B000G8O0MU", "B000EWBKU8", "B0047ERZ7Q", "B000KKRD2S", "B00168PFFK", "B00311G2DY", "B00083G5CG", "B002BS47WG", "B0007Z2556", "B0009FU10U", "B000B8IA4E", "B0045SE9XC", "B000AAJTM0", "B0019C6KAC", "B000F2DE8S", "B0011VPYIK", "B0009350CQ", "B0009NJFPY", "B000ADWD2A", "B000FYZS6M", "B000VIUNZI", "B000AQ690Y", "B0009WPZPY", "B003ALEWKU", "B000F4PDEO", "B000A7Q1XI", "B000803BQM", "B0009K7RTI", "B000MNP2KS", "B000NIBUQW", "B000BKJ76C", "B0013KPSDA", "B007ZH9OFI", "B000059TMB", "B002TPTDFC", "B000A3XYE6", "B00151QYU8", "B000F5GJO6", "B0009VRHME", "B0009W5JAA", "B0009RCPXE", "B000BW7QV8", "B0009NSE42", "B001IZNIVE", "B000BYRCRO", "B000B5IOVQ", "B000B5IOW0", "B00083FZH2"], "bought_together": ["B000WZEZFY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001G5T6GW", "B00H9KKGTO", "B00B65JMEI", "B00AEFXJS6"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 199481}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 19.5, "brand": "Son", "asin": "B000J3OTO6", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51MwbfwtGuL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Talladega Nights - The Ballad of Ricky Bobby [UMD for PSP]"}

{"description": "Marvel Comics' armor-clad superheroIron Mangets another update in this animated feature, which incorporates much of his mythology in its energetic storyline. Here, millionaire Tony Stark (voiced by Marc Worden, who performed similar duties for Marvel'sUltimate Avengersand its sequel) is inspired to create his iconic suit after being injured at an archaeological dig in China. His heroic alter ego isn't the only thing to arise from the dig; the ancient city harbors a quartet of elemental spirits, who seek to resurrect the Mandarin and continue his reign of evil. Hardcore Marvel fans may decry some of the deviations from the originalIron Mantext (Stark's father Howard is alive and well in the feature, and the suits are already in development by the time Stark is injured), but the prevalence of numerous figures from the source material (in addition to the Mandarin, there's James Rhodes, a.k.a. War Machine, Pepper Potts, the agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., Wong Chu, and glimpses of several incarnations of the Iron Man suit) and the overall vigor of the story and the quality of the 2-D and 3-D animation should please most viewers, and makes for an enjoyable alternative to the impressive 2008 live-action film.

{"description": "Much was written about Will Ferrell's first \"dramatic role\" as Harold Crick, an IRS auditor who begins hearing a voice narrating his life. ButStranger Than Fictionis hardly a drama. However, what Ferrell does--like Jim Carrey before him inThe Truman Show--is handle a toned-down character with genuineness and affection: you believe he is this guy. Crick leads a lonely life filled with numbers and routines. While at first he considers the voice a nuisance, Crick decides more action is needed when it speaks of \"his demise.\" Enter Professor Jules Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman), who takes on the absurd notion with revelry, trying to find out what kind of book Crick's life is leading. It turns out that the voice Crick is hearing belongs to Kay Eiffel (Emma Thompson), a very real--and troubled--author who is writing a book in which Crick is a fictional character. As usual with these things, the stuffed shirt learns to live a better life--Crick even falls for one of his audits, a brash baker named Ana (Maggie Gyllenhaal). Marc Foster (Monster's Ball, Finding Neverland) has the right tone for the film, using great urban scenes (the unnamed city is Chicago) with interesting visualizations of Crick's world of numbers. He also directs Ferrell, Hoffman, and Gyllenhaal to their most charming performances (plus Linda Hunt and Tom Hulce pop up in two funny scenes). Ferrell succeeds in being a romantic lead you can root for; a scene where he eats Ana's freshly baked cookies is totally delightful without a hint of sarcasm. Screenwriter Zach Helm has two personal traits with his story: like Crick he followed his heart (he stopped rewriting scripts and only worked on his own) and like Eiffel, the final results are not a masterpiece, but good, and entertaining enough.

{"description": "Martin Scorsese makes a welcome return to the mean streets (of Boston, in this case) withThe Departed, hailed by many as Scorsese's best film sinceCasino. Since this crackling crime thriller is essentially a Scorsese-stamped remake of the acclaimed 2002 Hong Kong thrillerInfernal Affairs, the film was intensely scrutinized by devoted critics and cinephiles, and while Scorsese's intense filmmaking and all-star cast deserve ample acclaim,The Departedis also worthy of serious re-assessment, especially with regard to what some attentive viewers described as sloppy craftsmanship (!), notably in terms of mismatched shots and jagged continuity. But no matter where you fall on the Scorsese appreciation scale, there's no denying thatThe Departedis a signature piece of work from one of America's finest directors, designed for maximum impact with a breathtaking series of twists, turns, and violent surprises. It's an intricate cat-and-mouse game, but this time the cat and mouse are both moles: Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) is an ambitious cop on the rise, planted in the Boston police force by criminal kingpin Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a hot-tempered police cadet who's been artificially disgraced and then planted into Costello's crime operation as a seemingly trustworthy soldier. As the multilayered plot unfolds (courtesy of a scorching adaptation byKingdom of Heavenscreenwriter William Monahan), Costigan and Sullivan conduct a volatile search for each other (they're essentially looking for \"themselves\") while simultaneously wooing the psychiatrist (Vera Farmiga) assigned to treat their crime-driven anxieties.Such convenient coincidences might sink a lesser film, butThe Departedis so electrifying that you barely notice the plot-holes. And while Nicholson's profane swagger is too much \"Jack\" and not enough \"Costello,\" he's still a joy to watch, especially in a film that's additionally energized by memorable (and frequently hilarious) supporting roles for Alec Baldwin, Mark Wahlberg, and a host of other big-name performers.The Departedalso makes clever and plot-dependent use of cell-phones, to the extent that it couldn't exist without them. Powered by Scorsese's trademark use of well-chosen soundtrack songs (from vintage rock to Puccini's operas),The Departedmay not be perfect, but it's one helluva ride for moviegoers, proving popular enough to become the biggest box-office hit of Scorsese's commercially rocky career.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002ZG99N6", "B000P0J09M", "B004SIP7TE", "B004SIP8ZM", "B002ZG980U", "B002VWNIEA", "B00011CZRE", "B00AEBB8NI", "B002T9H2LA", "B00005JLSB", "B000MZHW40", "B00080ZG10", "B003ASLJQS", "B000P0J0AG", "B000P0J0EW", "B000C20VPA", "B003UESJHO", "B004SIP7ZS", "B003ASLJO0", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B002CPMB9O", "B00AHTYI5M", "B00275EGWY", "B000XR9L50", "B000A3XY5A", "B0007DFJ0G", "B001N44BVQ", "B00003CXWV", "B008MILL8W", "B000286RP2", "B004SIP7VM", "B00005V9HH", "6305313687", "B00AEBB9NM", "B004FQX5B6", "B00AEFXKUI", "B004SIP95G", "B00AEBB86A", "B005LAIIJY", "B0016Q2D66", "B003ASLJQI", "B00008975Z", "B000IY04Q8", "B001P9KR8U", "B00005JNJV", "B000C20VRS", "B008R65XYC", "B005LAIGRS", "B00H9KKGTO", "B00008DP4C", "B00AEBB9F0", "B00AEFY5B6", "B00005JN0W", "B005LAIGLE", "B000A2UBN4", "B002QEHPQU", "B000P0J0EM", "B003UESJH4", "B007D5E7C2", "6304765258", "B000P0J0D8", "B00AEFY0XE", "B00004WG2F", "0767830555", "B000LC55F2", "B002O3Z4Y8", "B004EPYZP8", "B000A7DVR2", "B00005JPD0", "B000WZEZGI", "B00049QQHI", "B000FS9FCG", "B00004XPPB", "B006OFN0SE", "B009AMAL4Y", "B004U7MR14", "B000GFLKF8", "B003AWRMCE", "B0019L770A", "B00BEIYN9Q", "B0000AM6JI", "B004SIP9Z6", "B001GZ6QC4", "0783240295", "B0010DR4BO", "B000065U1N", "B00001ZWUS", "B00BB67UNW", "B0000B1OFL", "B00AEBB9K0", "B00DHDDE32", "B00005JKWX", "B0051MKNV8", "B002ZG97RE", "0767802519", "B0034G4P94", "B00DHHWXYY", "B00005B6JZ", "B00003CXZ4", "B001TODCII"], "bought_together": ["B000P0J09M"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000RETOHY", "B000P0J09M", "B000P0J0EW", "B00AEBB8NI"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 5067}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.5, "brand": "Warner Bros", "asin": "B000M341QE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RZnzpL34L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)"}
