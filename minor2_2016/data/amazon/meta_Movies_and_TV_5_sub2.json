{"description": "Woody Allen's feature-film debut,Take the Money and Run, a mockumentary that combines sight gags, sketchlike scenes, and standup jokes at rat-a-tat speed, looks positively primitive compared to his mature work. Primitive, but awfully funny. Allen plays Virgil Starkwell, a music-loving nebbish who turns to a life of crime at an early age and, undaunted by his utter and complete failure to pull off a single successful robbery, continues his unbroken spree of bungled heists and prison breaks even after he marries and raises a family. Narrator Jackson Beck, whose stentorian voice of authority makes a perfect foil for Starkwell's absurd exploits, lobs one droll quip after another with deadpan seriousness. Though spotty, Allen tosses so many jokes into the mix that it hardly matters and when they hit they are often hilarious: the chain gang posing as cousins to their old-woman hostage (\"We're very close,\" Virgil explains to a dim cop), arguing with a dotty movie director who is supposed to be their cover for a bank robbery, Virgil's escape attempt with a bar of soap. Allen spoofs decades of crime films, everything fromI Am a Fugitive from a Chain GangtoBonnie and Clyde, but you don't have to know the movies to enjoy this goofy, sometimes clumsy, but quite clever comedy.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000068DV", "6303011411", "0792846117", "6300216365", "B00003CXGR", "6304785801"], "also_viewed": ["6302697042"]}, "price": 19.9, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 382476}, "asin": "0764003828", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51TBXJ3E20L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Take the Money and Run [VHS]"}
{"description": "Film buffs and critics can argue until their faces turn blue about whether this lavish Dickensian musical deserved the Academy Award for Best Picture of 1968, but the movie speaks for itself on grandly entertaining terms. Adapted from Dickens's classic novel, it's one of the most dramatically involving and artistically impressive musicals of the 1960s, directed by Carol Reed with a delightful enthusiasm that would surely have impressed Dickens himself. Mark Lester plays the waifish orphan Oliver Twist, who is befriended by the pickpocketing Artful Dodger (Jack Wild) and recruited into the gang of boy thieves led by Fagin (played to perfection by Ron Moody). The villainous Bill Sikes (Oliver Reed) casts his long shadow over Oliver and his friends, but the young orphan is still able to find loving care in the most desperate of circumstances. Full of memorable melodies and splendid lyrics,Oliver!is a timeless film, prompting even hard-to-please critic Pauline Kael to call it \"a superb demonstration of intelligent craftsmanship,\" and to further observe that \"it's as if the movie set out to be a tribute to Dickens and his melodramatic art as well as to tell the story of Oliver Twist.\"--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B0000VCZKM", "B000RPCK2E", "B005NFJAZS", "B00G9EOQ8I", "B0001I55TC", "B00000F17A", "B000026FAZ", "B001J4E1CY", "B000002W8R", "B002HK9IDQ", "B000BITV92", "B0000AM6IY", "0780021312", "B000HT3PGU", "B0001WTUJE", "B0045HCJJY", "B00D3K357O", "B0006HBV3W", "B00005JL1P", "B00012FXJ0", "B007P7UF0G", "B00004TVUD", "B00AATV0WS", "B000BYA4HE", "B001PO550A", "B000002SLN", "0792839749", "B0090XLDKY", "6305320802", "B00005AUKE", "B003BZXIA0", "B00AEFY6DI", "B000KJTGHO", "0767827651", "B0007Z0O9U", "B0001US8F8", "B009Z59782", "B00011D1OK", "B00005MEOU", "B0045HCJQM", "B0007939PW", "B000HT3PGK", "B000AP04OM", "B0000549B1", "B001PO54V0", "B001GLX6TY", "B000VKL6RK", "B00004XMTJ", "B000025BD5", "B0009S4IKQ", "B000BT970O", "B000LPR6GA", "B00006RCO3", "B000XJD34I", "B000TPTCP0", "B009NYF2GQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0000VCZKM", "B00E9ZATKI", "B000RPCK2E", "B005NFJAZS"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 371247}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 10.0, "brand": "", "asin": "0767812417", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/517WF2e1VhL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "OLIVER! 30th Tribute Edition"}
{"description": "While most movie buffs are likely to callHalloweenthe best movie from John Carpenter, others--die-hard romantics and anyone who cried while watchingE.T.--might vote in favor of the director's 1984 hitStarman. It's easily Carpenter's warmest and most beguiling film, and the only one that ever earned an Oscar nomination. That honor went specifically to Best Actor nominee Jeff Bridges for his performance as an alien visitor to Earth who is knocked off course and must take an interstate road trip to rendezvous with a mothership from his home planet. To complete this journey he assumes the physical form of the dead husband of a Wisconsin widow (Karen Allen) who responds first with fear, then sympathy, and finally love. Carpenter's graceful strategy is to switch the focus of thisE.T.-like film from science fiction to a gentle road-movie love story, made believable by the memorable performances of Bridges and Allen. It's a bit heavy-handed with tenacious government agents who view the Starman as an alien threat (don't they always?), but Carpenter handles the action with intelligent flair, sensitivity, and lighthearted humor. If you're not choked up during the final scene, well, you just might not be human.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B007G8SEF2", "B000QXDCJ2", "B0024FADAQ", "B00005JKIS", "B00020HAV0", "630471193X", "B0001I562I", "6305869103", "B0000844I8", "B0000648ZQ", "B00020HAWE", "0783232047", "B005FQ2H8W", "B00009AOBK", "B002GOAGZC", "B00008438U", "B00AEFXT7W", "B0045HCJKS", "B005QX8U2Q", "B001BGS17Q", "B0003JANU0", "B003ASLJMW", "B000EHRVOW", "B002GHHHKQ", "B00000G3PA", "B004AOECXI", "B00AEFY3MC", "B0000UJDLM", "B0015NORDW", "B00004TX5G", "B00008G8LY", "B000065U1Q", "B00004W46I", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00008G8M4", "B00015YVD6", "B00005JKFR", "B001ECDVJU", "6305428506", "B0045HCJSA", "B00AEBB8VK", "B0087F7VSY", "B0013LL2Z2", "B0025VLELQ", "B002GHHHNI", "B00009AOBI", "B00005JPD0", "0767821467", "B000EHSVOG", "B00GJNQ4M0", "B000JU8H9C", "B00004YA66", "B00009PY3X", "B0068FZ0GK", "B0045HCJ9E", "B0002V7OI8", "B000VECAD0", "6305213283", "B000FO0A9W", "630542845X", "0784011338", "B000096IAC", "B004SIP6C2", "B0001NBLYK", "B00066FBQG", "0783225814", "B00000IQW5", "0800195175", "B00AEFY4CG", "6305236569", "6305308853", "B00009OWJY", "B000FO0AA6", "0792844866", "B000NJMJGG", "B000MDFTHE", "B00AEFYXJ0"], "bought_together": ["B0024FADAQ", "B000QXDCJ2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0024FADAQ", "B000QXDCJ2", "B000VECAD0", "B000OA8OK4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 15141}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.38, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "0767812166", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5111TSVWTWL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Starman"}
{"description": "Lou Diamond Phillips leaves a haunting impression as the late 1950s pop idol Ritchie Valens, who made the Latino influence in rock &amp; roll conspicuous through his hit songs. Filmmaker Luis Valdez (Zoot Suit) creates a nimble, exciting, and sympathetic portrait of the boy driven to rise above obstacles of race and family legacy, and Esai Morales is equally fine as Ritchie's envious, searching brother. Great support from Elizabeth Pe&ntilde;a and Danielle von Zerneck as Valens's sister and mother, respectively, and Joe Pantoliano is solid as the singer's straight-talking manager. Valdez brightens up the third act with a rock &amp; roll show featuring, among others, Brian Setzer as Eddie Cochrane. Marshall Crenshaw turns up as Buddy Holly getting on that plane with Valens, and Los Lobos (who actually performs Valens's music on the soundtrack) has a nifty cameo as a Tijuana band that gives Valens a piece of crucial inspiration.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000P0J0CY", "B0001CNQX0", "B00000K3TX", "B00004RJ71", "B0002DRDIW", "B0000714BS", "B0000714BQ", "B000002LC8", "B003NF97NK", "0783114907", "B00180IPM6", "B00007J5VO", "B005HFI7IU", "B003E1QDAI", "B00004ZESY", "B000K2UGZM", "B000AM4P90", "B00AEBB9IM", "B0009R1TJ0", "B00005N89M", "B002WJHBCC", "B00AEFY5TI", "B000KJU15U", "B000063JDI", "B00465I1CE", "B000RHRGSK", "B002XUBDRY", "B00AEBB9ZK", "B003VA3JZY", "B00EE8AIW4", "6305428409", "B000GJ0LLI", "B0042837D8", "B0009IOR6Q", "B00AEFXZJE", "B0000DIXDR", "B004AOECXI", "B000K2Q7CI", "B0009HLC9W", "B00004Y2R1", "B00CAYH200", "6305428271", "B000065V3H", "B001GD6VTE", "B00441GYZG", "B001AEF6BS", "B0042EJDGM", "B000B74GCA", "0767821769", "B001D0T4JY", "0767812387", "B000P0J0C4", "B00009AOBI", "0800141806", "B000E8QVWY", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00005V9IA", "B0002VGTBQ", "0783228686", "B00006FDCD", "6305428050", "B00006RCOC", "B000N3T0HI", "B00AEFXP8K", "B00E1HIX66", "6305744793", "B00009AOAX", "B00008L3U1", "B00AMSS3TA", "B000E8QVBU", "B00005JND5", "B000ERVK3A", "B00081U7HC", "B00AEFY4CG", "B00AEFY5B6", "B0002VEZ3U", "B000FOPPC4", "B008IG0F4Y", "B001DJLD12", "B00003CXPS", "B000068TPB", "B00069FL7C", "B004IKZQPW", "B00158K0R4", "B000H5TH20", "B00AEFXPG2", "B00AEBBADG", "B001BGS16W", "B00003CXTG", "B0002TT0MI", "B0087F7VSY", "B0000AQS5F", "076780421X", "0767812182", "B002BIULKS", "6305213305", "B00004TJKK", "B00027JZ3E", "B00075VX2C", "B00006RZ9Y"], "bought_together": ["B000P0J0CY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00004RJ71", "B000P0J0CY", "B000A50460", "B0001CNQX0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 8913}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.99, "brand": "Philips", "asin": "0767821637", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51R7P26XWQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "La Bamba"}

{"description": "SLC Punkstarts out entertainingly enough as a sarcastic snapshot of the punk-rock scene in Salt Lake City in 1985--complete with mohawks, moshing, and vague avowals of anarchy. But gradually, the wanderings of Stevo (Matthew Lillard fromScream) and Heroin Bob (Michael Goorjian) turn into a multilayered exploration of character and culture shock. Though he spends his days drinking and mocking the values of his parents, Stevo turns just as critical an eye on his own rhetoric and lifestyle, and comes to find that aimless rebellion may be just as hollow as the mindless pursuit of money. No character has the right point of view; there are no easy solutions. Despite lacking anything in the way of a plot,SLC Punksustains its energy through wit, realism, propulsive editing, and excellent performances from Lillard, Goorjian, and the rest of the cast. It's emblematic of the movie's sophistication that Stevo's lawyer father (Christopher McDonald, who played Geena Davis's  husband inThelma and Louise) is treated satirically without being dismissed; though baffled by his son's form of rebellion, he never loses hope that Stevo will go on to law school and continues to cajole Stevo and argue with him about how the world works. By its end, the constantly shifting perspective ofSLC Punkachieves a surprising emotional depth. It's also given a lot of energy by a well-chosen soundtrack of energetic but not overly familiar music of the time, including selections from Fear, the Dead Kennedys, the Stooges, and even Roxy Music.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783228317", "B000059PR8", "B00005T33W", "0792839641", "6304297912"], "also_viewed": ["B00005JM23", "B00006G8O1"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 386721}, "asin": "0767835980", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5177E0S0XPL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Slc Punk [VHS]"}

{"description": "In faithfully adapting Maxim Gorky's classic playThe Lower Depths, Akira Kurosawa incorporated themes from several of his better-known films. Transplanted from the play's Russian setting to Japan's Edo (pre-Tokyo) period, the film cleverly places its poverty-stricken characters into a vividly Japanese context while retaining their tenacious defense against life's relentless miseries. As the title implies, the comedic drama unfolds literally in a hole--a dreary tenement sunken into a refuse-strewn landscape--where Kurosawa's superb cast breathes life into the hopes, dreams, and delusions of their characters. Landlady, thief, prostitute, tinker, actor... all but the cynical gambler live in desperate self-deception, and Kurosawa finds poignant humor in the ways they hold reality at bay. Toshiro Mifune excels as the thief, but this is perhaps Kurosawa's greatest ensemble achievement; lengthy rehearsals and multiple cameras resulted in a fluid, masterful film full of fine performances, confined to only two intimate settings yet embracing universal foibles of humanity.--Jeff Shannon", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 487384}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.77, "brand": "", "asin": "0780020812", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71XN60DC3XL._SY300_.gif", "title": "The Lower Depths [VHS]"}
{"description": "By the time he madeGood Morningin 1959, Yasujiro Ozu  had completely eliminated camera movement from his uniquely simple but  elegant directorial style. He chose instead to emphasize static but  meticulously purposeful compositions that rarely, if ever, wavered from  their recognizable low-angle perspective. InGood Morning, this  observational approach is put to sublime use to establish setting (a late-'50s Tokyo suburb) and to view the world through the eyes of the  film's central characters&#x97;-two young brothers who take a mutual vow of  silence to protest their parents' refusal to buy a TV set. Their father claims that television will create \"a million idiots,\" while their  mother is angered by the boys' neglect of schoolwork in favor of  watching sumo wrestling on a neighbor's TV.In Ozu's hands, this sublimely simple conflict inspires a comedic exploration of Japan at the dawn of its electronic age, when  consumerism and materialism are in vogue, salesmen solicit their wares  in constant door-to-door visits, and even the purchase of a washing  machine can prompt neighbors into a frenzy of gossipy speculation.  Funniest of all are the conspiratorial brothers, who play an amusing  variation of \"pull my finger\" (proving that even great directors can  indulge a fart joke if they choose), and employ their silent strategy  with the stubbornness that only children can get away with. Through it  all, Ozu develops a handful of intermingling themes of love,  communication, goodwill, and the changing of societal traditions.  Utterly simple on the surface,Good Morningreveals its  complexity in careful proportion, with the affectionate humanity that  was Ozu's greatest gift.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001BEK8CE", "B000OPPAF6", "B003ICZW7S", "B0001GH5RY", "B00026L7MC", "B00EO2I6W4", "B00005JLV7", "B0012Z3630", "B000EOTWIS", "B00HVOFP6W", "B00007CVS2", "B00HVOFP9O", "B000BB14I0", "B000KRNGNQ", "B00GPPXNEE", "0780023099", "B000067IY6", "B00A8QDHYW", "7885729117", "B00CEIOH8C", "B00GA9F2PI", "B000I8OOG0", "B00129CFMY", "B00IGK6T9W", "B00004W3HF", "B001LMU1C8", "B00B2BYXSQ", "B000093NR0", "B000F7CEC0", "B00007CVS3", "B0000A02TW", "B000BR6QCI", "B00DZP1BUU", "B00AQ6J536", "B00IGK6TGU", "B006X96PBU", "B00GPPXP6A", "B0000633SD", "B00152VXU8", "B004OOL73W", "B0001UZZSG", "B00000CQJZ", "B00F98FOFY", "B000BC8SWE", "B00180R072", "B000AQKUG8", "B0019X400S", "B00IGK6TLA", "B00092ZLG2", "B004M66YUS", "B00004Z1FM", "B00JGR3M26", "B00GPPXNLC", "6305744114", "B00CUKTHJ8", "B00005UQ7Q", "B00I3C1T1Q", "B00005QAPJ", "B001BEK8BK", "B00J2R3W1G", "B004ALIG4M", "1559409053", "B000K0YLZ0", "B00005JKGX", "B00005BCK0", "B00J5LXMTG", "B00GBT629C", "B00GBT63IC", "B001LMU19G", "B000NOK0GW", "B0007939R0", "B0035ECI12", "B004VH657U", "B004ALIG1U", "B0000A02TX", "B00005B1ZK", "B00DHN8GQ2", "B000E5LEVA", "B000093NQZ", "B000PKG6OY", "B000E5LEV0", "B00092ZLEY", "B00CUKTHHK", "0780022343", "B001BEK8BU", "B000K0YLX2", "B004WPYO4C", "B000E1YVZ0", "B000BMY2NS", "6305257450", "B00004W229", "B004CGUBZW", "B00005BHW6", "B00GG0NABE", "B00004XQMY", "B00JAQJNN0", "B00009MEA0", "B000GTJSE4", "B008Y5OWO8"], "bought_together": ["B001BEK8CE", "B000OPPAF6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000OPPAF6", "B001BEK8CE", "B00EO2I6W4", "B000EOTWIS"]}, "price": 21.9, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 62659}, "asin": "0780023307", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41EBVQ3D9SL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Good Morning (The Criterion Collection)"}

{"description": "Even if the notorious 1970s porn-filmmaking milieu doesn't exactly turn you on, don't let it turn you off to this movie's extraordinary virtues, either.Boogie Nightsis one of the key movies of the 1990s, and among the most ambitious and exuberantly alive American movies in years. It's also the breakthrough for an amazing new director, whose dazzling kaleidoscopic style here recalls the Robert Altman ofNashvilleand the Martin Scorsese ofGoodFellas. Although loosely based on the sleazy life and times of real-life porn legend John Holmes, at heart it's a classic Hollywood rise-and-fall fable: a naive, good-looking young busboy is discovered in a San Fernando Valley disco by a famous motion picture producer, becomes a hotshot movie star, lives the high life, and then loses everything when he gets too big for his britches, succumbs to insobriety, and is left behind by new times and new technology. Of course, it ain't exactlyA Star Is BornorSingin' in the Rain.  Writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson (in only his second feature!) puts his own affectionately sardonic twist on the old showbiz biopic formula: the ambitious upstart changes his name and achieves stardom in porno films as &quot;Dirk Diggler.&quot; Instead of drinking to excess, he snorts cocaine (the classic drug of '70s hedonism); and it's the coming of home video (rather than talkies) that helps to dash his big-screen dreams. As for the britches ... well, the controversial &quot;money shot&quot; explains everything. And the cast is one of the great ensembles of the '90s, including Oscar nominees Burt Reynolds and Julianne Moore, Mark Wahlberg (who really can act--from the waist up, too!), Heather Graham (as Rollergirl), William H.

{"description": "The HBO documentaryWhen It Was a Game(slightly shortened on DVD from the two-part VHS release) is based on a highly original idea: tell the story of baseball from the Great Depression era through the late 1950s using footage from home-movie cameras shot by fans and players. The result is a marvelous retelling of baseball in America as seen from the ground--the culture of stadiums, the ritual of afternoon games, the spiritually sustaining rivalries. Somewhat enthralled by the images at its disposal, the film has a way of almost stepping back from itself, waxing poetic at a sighting of the St. Louis Cardinals' \"Gashouse Gang,\" or a glimpse of Bogart and Bacall in the stands, or the legendary contests between the New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox. Among the truly unexpected sights is color footage of the 1938 World Series (Cubs versus Yanks), not only from inside the stadium walls but from the street as traffic cops, crowds, and vehicles amassed. Of course, there are the heroes, too, often caught in relaxed, unselfconscious moments through the lens of a teammate or a true believer in the bleachers. A great experience all around.Arguably more defined and even more lyrical than its predecessor, the second installment ofWhen It Was a Gamemoves from a general celebration of baseball culture in America to a specific focus on various facets of the game's history. Once again using footage compiled from the 8mm and 16mm collections that players and fans shot over decades, this sequel follows, among other things, the special relationship between game announcers and fans and takes a fascinating trip through the story of the farm-team system during the 1930s, '40s, and '50s (particularly the near-alternate world of the Coast League). The working-class commonality of players and fans is examined, too. Imagine taking the subway home from Ebbets Field and finding yourself looking back on the day's game with a Dodger outfielder. (It could, and often did, happen.) Brooklyn's assimilation of the Dodgers into their community identity, a story often told, is covered quite winningly here, as is the heartbreak of the team's desertion to sunny California. Closing in on its final minutes, the film takes us on a tour of some of the game's legends and presents a touching tribute to the extraordinary Babe Ruth.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000059H7M", "B00284EMI2", "B002DQL34Q", "B00005M20J", "B001BSBBF8", "B003S1UNZU", "B0010YSD90", "B00AATUZLU", "B00BR0SFEU", "B0013XZ6XY", "B000R7HY46", "B003VE9WTW", "B000EULSRK", "B000WPE8Q0", "B005SQRYEG", "B002N57KEY", "078324021X", "B0012YYZDG", "B000FTCLRG", "B00009AOAX", "B000MNOX94", "B0006Q941Y", "B009NNM9OA", "B00DW5IKW0", "B00A1AU5Y0", "B004J713LK", "B00BR0SE3M", "B000053V7F", "B005ENCIUI", "B008LW25CK", "B004X2TYG2", "B00E1HIWTO", "B00005Y6YH", "B000FBFYVY", "1592408648", "B004QRUN8M", "B000REMOT4", "B004JWY3U8", "B00DNF1SSC", "B0010YSD8Q", "B000MNOX80", "B0068FZ0GK", "B00AMSQBP8", "B00005Y6YG", "B009POCG2C", "0679762892", "B0060ZJ7BC", "B00C7A8WWO", "B0000B1OC1", "B00720ONHM", "B000P296DK", "B000068NNU", "B00AEFXHNI", "B00004ZES7", "B004B3LG4Q", "B0002234HM", "B000M8NMVO", "B000REMOTE", "B00020X8WK", "B000BTO3L2"], "bought_together": ["B000059H7M", "B00005M20J"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005B32G", "B003S1UNZU", "B00284EMI2", "B00005M20J"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 159232}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 14.95, "brand": "Team Marketing", "asin": "0783117531", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51hXKm3Z-ZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "When It Was a Game"}

Think Shakespeare'sHenry IVwith a dash ofTremors, and set in another galaxy. But despite plenty of strangely whispered voice-overs that explain the characters' thoughts (and endlessly detailed exposition), storytelling is not really among the film's strong points. There are, however, a lot of memorably fantastic/grotesque images, an extraordinary cast, and a soundtrack featuring Toto. I told you it was weird.

{"description": "After the global phenomenon that wasJurassic Park, it was a given that novelist Michael Crichton would conjure up a sequel and that Steven Spielberg would then commit it to film. Considering the potential profit involved, it was practically a commercial mandate. Perhaps it was inevitable that both efforts were contrived, and well below the talents of Crichton (well, maybe) and certainly Spielberg, who just didn't have the heart for this recycling after the artistic triumph ofSchindler's List. What we're left with, for better and worse, is a redundant blockbuster that still benefits from Spielberg's mastery of high-intensity action sequences and the further development of amazing computer-generated special effects. What's missing is the awe and wonder that madeJurassic Parka technical marvel and a dazzling product of scientific imagination. The story's a no-brainer: after the deadly fiasco of the original dinosaur theme park, we're taken (along with returning star Jeff Goldblum) to a second island where genetically engineered dinosaurs still thrive under the watchful eye of Goldblum's biologist girlfriend (Julianne Moore). But a devious capitalist (Arliss Howard) is determined to export dinosaurs to a new park in San Diego, financing a hunt-and-capture expedition that results in another series of fatal disasters. In Spielberg's hands this movie's more exciting than it has a right to be, given the creative paucity of Crichton's novel and David Koepp's adapted screenplay. The special effects are state-of-the-art, and the T-Rex's rampage through the streets of San Diego is nothing short of spectacular; but apparently an improvement upon the shortcomings ofJurassic Parkwas too much to hope for.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00003CXXR", "6303148352", "0788805533", "6301666569", "6304290888", "6303506291", "0783216084", "6304169558", "6303212379", "B0000524CZ", "B0000048S1", "B00006FDFG", "6304155972", "0788811002"], "bought_together": ["B00003CXXR", "6303148352"], "also_viewed": ["B00B4804KS", "B0087ZG7J8", "6303148352", "B0057R5XRG", "B00003CXXR", "0788812408", "078881172X", "080010367X", "6304015127", "630157401X", "6303486894", "B00000JGEI", "630021463X", "6303215734", "6300215830", "6302320402", "6304089767", "6305750750", "B00005JM5E", "6303314015", "6302642248", "B000LPS4BG", "079213690X", "B008M4MB8K", "B007LNBS2I", "B00HWWUQWQ"]}, "price": 25.93, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 670881}, "asin": "0783223358", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51FZH56FA4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Lost World: Jurassic Park [VHS]"}

{"description": "A movie that only true horror buffs could love,Army of Darknessis officially part 3 in the wild and wacky Evil Dead trilogy masterminded by the perversely inventive director Sam Raimi, who would later serve as executive producer of the popular syndicated TV seriesHercules: The Legendary Journeys.Raimi's favorite actor, Bruce Campbell, returns as Ash (hero of the first two Evil Dead flicks), a hardware-store clerk who is magically transported--along with his beat-up Oldsmobile and a chainsaw attachment for his severed left forearm--to the brutal battlefields of the 14th century. He quickly assumes power (who else in the Middle Ages packs a shotgun and a chainsaw?), and unites his band of medieval knights against the dreaded Army of the Dead. Raimi gleefully subverts almost every horror-movie clich&eacute; as he serves up a nonstop parade of blood, gore, and vicious sword-bearing skeletons--an affectionate homage to animator Ray Harryhausen's classicJason and the Argonauts. The frantic action is fun while it lasts, but even at 80 minutesArmy of Darknessnearly wears out its welcome. You know that Raimi can maintain the mayhem for only so long before it grows tiresome, and fortunately this madcap movie quits while it's ahead.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B005J9ZFQG", "B000WC3864", "B008JFUNYG", "B001KEGR5M", "B0001LQJMQ", "B003S6S7TY", "B004GGU9K0", "B000QUCQX8", "B008CYDD7I", "B005J9ZE5I", "B00C6F61IW", "B004GGU9JQ", "B00004Y87O", "B000WC38FA", "B000AQ69QS", "B0006A9FKA", "B00IF8Q0YE", "B0013D8LAE", "B000RIWAVW", "B0002C9DK4", "B000F7CMPE", "B0001611DI", "B0000AOX0F", "B002LMSWN2", "B000FS9FE4", "B0002CHK1S", "157362408X", "B000IJ7A5Q", "B002GHHHG0", "B00D7AM6M0", "B000I2J68M", "B00009MGEM", "B001NPD9LS", "B00AQJ8MLY", "B000VKL6Z2", "B004SIP6LS", "B00007AJG4", "B002JT69IW", "0790729342", "B0009OUBC4", "B00005JA8B", "B001D5C1OO", "B000V4UFZK", "B00005LC4Q", "B0056P6SOG", "B004P7CMOQ", "B000UAE7O0", "B000WC389G", "B0016MJ6P6", "B000I0RNVQ", "B008WAM2E2", "B0001US7OA", "B00005N5RM", "B00AEFY2WI", "B000FJH5MC", "B000099T3M", "B004EI2NP4", "B00005JO16", "B008G33PIM", "B001DJLD1W", "B000TSIJWY", "B001DJLD0S", "B000AXWHSA", "B000FA57UI", "B00AEFXW8I", "B00018D42W", "B000068IEV", "B000S0GYRU", "B000FA57US", "6304712499", "B001B8XRT6", "B002VWNIDG", "B002OVO18A", "B0002ABURA", "B00006FDCD", "B00AEFYDM2", "B0028DRGDQ", "B008874968", "B0000AOX09", "B001KEGR5W", "B0000VCZNE", "0312291450", "B0087ZG7UW", "B0024FAG44", "B0053TWV46", "B0058I9DZM", "B003VMFWXO", "B003WTO5NO", "B0015U0QWG", "B004XVMCH6", "B004LWZW24", "B001B1UO6W", "B005HI4LMS", "B000LP6KNU", "B004SIP9Z6", "B00317LM8S", "B0031U8OEK", "B0024FADBA", "B000C20VRS"], "bought_together": ["B005J9ZFQG", "B000WC3864"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005J9ZFQG", "B00005R24K", "B008JFUNYG", "B009JBWOU0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 22777}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.74, "brand": "Universal Studios", "asin": "0783227434", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DQ0H428VL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Army of Darkness"}
{"description": "Deservedly acclaimed as one of 1998's best films, this sequel to the beloved 1995 live-action fantasy proved a commercial catastrophe and a source of dismay to parents expecting another bucolic, sweet-natured fable. Every bit as sly and visually stunning as its predecessor,Babe: Pig in the Cityis otherwise a jolting ride beyond the Hoggetts' farm into a no less vivid but far darker world--the allegorical city of the title, which for the diminutive \"sheep pig\" proves truly nightmarish. Australian filmmaker George Miller (Mad Max,The Road Warrior), who produced and cowrote the first film, this time takes the director's reins, and he ratchets up the pace and the peril as effectively as he did on his influential trilogy of apocalyptic, outback sci-fi thrillers.From the opening scene,Babe: Pig in the Citymeans to disrupt the reassuring calm achieved by the conclusion of the previous film. Babe's prior triumph proves short-lived, and within moments Miller has us literally peering into the depths as he sets up a horrific well accident that nearly kills the taciturn but good-hearted Farmer Hoggett (James Cromwell), Babe's beloved \"Boss.\" Journeying with the equally pink, even plumper Mrs. Hoggett (Magda Szubanski), the young pig finds himself in a city where animals are outcasts, staying in the lone hotel that allows pets. When Mrs. Hoggett is detained, Babe must contend with the suspicions and rivalries of the hotel's other four-legged guests. The film's G status doesn't fully telegraph the shock Miller induces: bad things happen to good animals, and Babe's new acquaintances are a far cry from his colleagues on the farm. In particular, he must contend with a cynical family of chimps given wonderful, dead-pan voice characterizations by Steven Wright and Glenne Headly.Miller's use of effects to transform his animals into \"actors\" is even more seamlessly integrated than inBabe. The sequel's production design is crucial to the creation of a complete, absorbing world, and purely visual ideas--such as a deluge of blue balloons during the climactic ballroom battle--achieve a splendor and originality that a room full of computer-graphics desktops couldn't muster. Ultimately, though, the film does more than amaze: as Babe's compassion and courage transform those around him, we're moved in ways that purveyors of by-the-numbers family fare can only dream of.--Sam Sutherland", "related": {"bought_together": ["0783229011"], "also_viewed": ["0788802194", "0783229011", "6302961572", "6304015127", "6304401736", "155890641X", "B0000AK7AB", "B00JK531ES"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 348726}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.79, "brand": "", "asin": "078322561X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/519MBW3HVQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Babe - Pig in the City [VHS]"}
{"description": "The original cowriter and director ofFear and Loathing in Las Vegaswas Alex Cox, whose earlier filmSid and Nancysuggests that Cox could have been a perfect match in filming  Hunter&nbsp;S. Thompson's psychotropic masterpiece of \"gonzo\" journalism. Unfortunately Cox departed due to the usual \"creative differences,\" and this ill-fated adaptation was thrust upon Terry Gilliam, whose formidable gifts as a visionary filmmaker were squandered on the seemingly unfilmable elements of Thompson's ether-fogged narrative. The result is a one-joke movie without the joke--an endless series of repetitive scenes involving rampant substance abuse and the hallucinogenic fallout of a road trip that's run crazily out of control. Johnny Depp plays Thompson's alter ego, \"gonzo\" journalist Raoul Duke, and Benicio Del Toro is his sidekick and so-called lawyer Dr. Gonzo. During the course of a trip to Las Vegas to cover a motorcycle race, they ingest a veritable chemistry set of drugs, and Gilliam does his best to show us the hallucinatory state of their zonked-out minds. This allows for some dazzling imagery and the rampant humor of stumbling buffoons, and the mumbling performances of Depp and Del Toro wholeheartedly embrace the tripped-out, paranoid lunacy of Thompson's celebrated book. But over two hours of this insanity tends to grate on the nerves--like being the only sober guest at a party full of drunken idiots. So while Gilliam's film may achieve some modest cult status over the years, it's only becauseFear and Loathingis best enjoyed by those who are just as stoned as the characters in the movie.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0006H32EI", "B006ISJQ1W", "B00003CXWV", "0767837398", "B002AF4Y9G", "B000A7DVR2", "B001EDFSIQ", "0679785892", "B0057ZAA6W", "6305313687", "B00029RTAI", "B0007DFJ0G", "B002QEHPQU", "B00008975Z", "B001HN69AY", "B004SIP9Z6", "B00005JM23", "B000F7CECK", "B000JMK6LW", "B000093FLA", "B000P0J09M", "B003HKN52U", "0783225903", "B00005R87R", "B004SIP95G", "B00000IRE6", "B000031EFY", "B00005ATQB", "B005Y4I6VW", "B0006HBZE2", "B00005Q4CS", "B004FQX5B6", "B009NNXQJW", "B0000VD04M", "B00006JDU8", "B00005V9HH", "B00011CZRE", "B002T9H2LA", "B000C20VPA", "B002CPMB9O", "B000AXWHSA", "B000ASDFI6", "B000P0J0D8", "0792838068", "B003W88QVC", "B00029RTCG", "B0011E5M66", "B0007PALZ2", "B00005JMJG", "B007D0FVRM", "B001J9KJ4I", "B006ISJQBM", "B000EMGJAO", "B0000CDUT5", "B000KB4898", "B0000AC8LR", "B004P7CNC2", "B004SIP7TE", "B00AEFXE9U", "B004SIP8ES", "B00AEFYS2M", "B000C20VRS", "B0000AC8LI", "B00ALU48M0", "B0009A40ES", "B000LP6KNU", "B00H9KKGTO", "B00AEBB8NI", "B0000640VJ", "B004SIP6LS", "B000286RP2", "B000GGSMC6", "0780621611", "B001HN694K", "B00009W5CA", "B004XVMCH6", "B001GCUO0W", "B000GBEWGQ", "B0006GAOJA", "B008R65XYC", "B000IY04Q8", "B000006NN1", "B000S6M1Y4", "B0012E2GFK", "B0007UC8Y4", "B0043X1FM2", "B0001CNRRU", "B00ALU46VI", "0767835093", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00005NTOH", "B000MMMT9G", "B005LAIIJY", "B00AG4714S", "B00000K3TS", "B000053VAZ", "B00009MGEM", "B001M4YZ90", "B002ZG980U", "1451659717"], "bought_together": ["B00003CXWV"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0679785892", "B00029RTAI", "0783225903", "B000A7DVR2"]}, "price": 5.0, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 3274}, "asin": "0783229526", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51LL2U2I2AL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"}

{"description": "Jan Morrow (Doris Day) and Brad Allen (Rock Hudson) have never met, but they're sworn enemies because of one small appliance in their lives: the telephone. The two share a party line, and Jan is outraged over the amount of time Bill spends wooing women over the phone. A convenient triangle emerges when a client (Tony Randall) of Jan's--she's an interior decorator--falls in love with her and happens to be Brad's old college chum. When Brad makes the connection, he decides to try to court Jan himself, to make her more sympathetic to his phone woes. Of course, she'd never go for such a heel, so he passes himself off as Rex Stetson, a Texas rancher visiting New York. The ensuing tale, albeit predictable, is lots of fun, with some quick-witted dialogue and some clever use of split-screens for the phone calls.  Thelma Ritter is hilarious as Jan's always-hung-over maid, Alma; and the pairing of Rock and Doris works beautifully, as always.--Jenny Brown", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0001CNRB6", "B00CZ7AL32", "B00007GZR0", "B00007GZR1", "B000JJSJPK", "B0007QS30G", "B0007QS2ZC", "B0007TKHFW", "B00009IB1F", "B00AEFY8ZE", "B001MBTSTA", "B00070HK2Y", "B000MGBLPK", "B000MGBLQE", "B0007QS2Z2", "B00IPL2CP2", "B000JJSJPA", "B00C3ALLFS", "B000056BOR", "B00008CMRN", "B000WTVZHQ", "B0001WTWVU", "B0009X75WE", "B00AEBB97S", "B00EL6ABL2", "B000P2A22O", "B000XT1P5C", "B0007QS2ZM", "B0045HCJHG", "B004GJYR7I", "B00005JLZW", "B0045HCJ9E", "B00AEBB8OC", "B000286S2E", "B0045HCJQW", "B00871C09S", "B0000DD77V", "B00005A06N", "B0001WTWS8", "B00023P4RO", "B006TTC5WC", "B0009X75QU", "B000W089XS", "B00023P4RE", "B0002HOEQ2", "B00006RCO1", "B001O2UTRW", "B002DQMXEU", "B00AKGG5WG", "B009YX8MSG", "B0090XLDKY", "B000CCW2TS", "B001GUYAZY", "B000JF5TXO", "B000EHQU08", "B006H37P5C", "B00DTISNBI", "B00K2CHUWW", "B0007TKGY4", "6304765266", "B00347AIMG", "B00AEFXLBQ", "B0010AN7Z4", "B0045HCJ7G", "B00A1AU6ZI", "B00008MTYC", "B004K4FUT8", "B0047CG9F2", "B000JU8HBA", "B00AMEZDK6", "B00AEFXSVE", "B0000DD780", "B007TYI7YQ", "B008D1Q1VU", "B00AEBB8YW", "B0007US7FI", "B0045HCJ76", "B005H8G78O", "B00AATV046", "B00C3ALLSA", "B001D8W7EK", "B0045HCJJY", "B002HK9IDQ", "B000JJSJP0", "B001QYOSEI", "B0009HLD3C", "B00I9BU5ZM", "6305236569", "B0015FGCI8", "B000ION7AI", "B00K6J7Q1Q", "B000YDBPAM", "B001D8W7EU", "B004XWGYV0", "B006TTC5Y0", "B00GOC752E", "B001LPWGH8", "0767821556", "B004KN3NXE", "B000ZM1MG4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000P2A22O", "B000JJSJPK", "B00007GZR1", "B00CZ7AL32"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 228299}, "asin": "0783233469", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Y26S8VJHL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Pillow Talk"}

Incarcerated, he uses another inmate's prison break as a cover for his own escape. Waiting for him, according to plan, is his partner, Buddy (Ving Rhames). Also waiting for him, not according to plan, is federal agent Karen Sisco (the ravishing Jennifer Lopez). She finds herself disarmed in more ways than one when she is deposited in the getaway car's trunk with Jack. But that doesn't stop her from joining the task force created to capture him, while he plans \"one last heist.\"Out of Sightis a rich, entertaining film, stylish without being showy, faithful to the integrity of Leonard's potent dialogue and quirky characters, and seamlessly acted by a dream ensemble. Standouts include Albert Brooks as convicted insider trader Richard Ripley, who while in prison brags to the wrong people that he has $5 million in uncut diamonds hidden in his house; Don Cheadle as Maurice (don't call him \"Snoopy\") Miller, with whom Jack warily teams up to steal said diamonds; Dennis Farina as Karen's protective father (his idea of a birthday gift is a Sig-Hauer .38); and, in unbilled cameos, Michael Keaton, reprising hisJackie Brownrole as FBI agent Ray Nicolet, and Samuel L.

{"description": "Based on the riveting bestseller by Richard Price, this 1995 crime drama was directed by Spike Lee with such authority and authenticity that it has the hyper-real quality of a stylized documentary. Fully capturing the thoroughly researched detail of Price's novel, the film focuses on Strike (newcomer Mekhi Phifer), a young, ambitious \"clocker\"--or drug dealer--who works the streets of his New York housing project, selling drugs for a local supplier named Rodney (played with ferocious charisma by Delroy Lindo). Just as Strike is struggling to get away from his dead-end life of crime, another dealer is murdered in a fast-food restaurant and local detectives (Harvey Keitel, John Turturro) consider Strike the primary suspect. In cowriting the script with novelist Price, Lee uses this murder mystery to explore the plague of guns and black-on-black crime in America's inner cities, in which drugs and death are familiar routines of daily life. The film doesn't pretend to offer solutions, nor does it dwell on the problem with numbing insistence. Rather, this taut, well-acted film takes the viewer into a world often hidden in plain sight--a world where options seem nonexistent for youth conditioned to have little or no expectation beyond a probable early death. Lee and Price are deadly serious in handling this volatile subject (which incorporates racism, powerless law enforcement, and political indifference), butClockersis also blessed with humor, insight, and humanity. It's one of Lee's most confidently directed films, signaling a creative maturity that Lee continued to develop throughout the 1990s.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000A2XAQ4", "B00005U156", "B0024EWP6W", "1558908390", "630514415X", "B00AEFYE08", "B00007AJG1", "B00008K7AO", "B0000549B2", "B00005JLG1", "B0000JBUHI", "0783230389", "B00000JGHV", "0783230524", "B0006H32DO", "B002CA68N4", "B0041QSZS8", "B00007BK2R", "6305505802", "B00005A1TJ", "B004SIP93S", "B00005B8UA", "0767811070", "B00005JD5J", "B00002RAO2", "B0006QAIG4", "B0028OH568", "B003BV8I3Q", "B00005N89M", "B000051YMS", "B00003W8NT", "B002CA68NO", "B003VA3JZY", "B00008RH3L", "B0000YEE6M", "B000TLOMPE", "B0000VV5DA", "B000XJD34S", "B00003CY51", "0792838076", "B000P0J0CE", "B008NNY8SQ", "B00AEBB9AA", "B004U7MR14", "B0000TWMWA", "B0009K7RMA", "B001LLH8SO", "B000P0J0AG", "B00007ELEN", "B00005UPFK", "B00I4X8KU2", "B00005UQ9I", "0767821955", "B00003CWSX", "0780631234", "B0001US62I", "B0000AC8LH", "B0000AM6J1", "6305594333", "B0001FGBUW", "B00008MTYF", "B00BTYMPX6", "B007WYOTCC", "B001A5ES6G", "6305505780", "B001BP4K22", "B00004Z1FX", "B008R65XYC", "B00A1AU72A", "B0000AM6JI", "B001TOD9VI", "B00GMV8KGW", "B00J0IPLBQ", "B004XECNCW", "B002O3Z4Y8", "B00BEIYKM6", "B0034G4OSG", "B004SIP6GI", "B000051YMP", "B004YOEDR4", "B0007N1JC8", "0312426186", "B00005O06V", "B001TOD92C", "B000GFLKF8", "B002VWNIEA", "630592273X", "B000F8O2QK", "B000089729", "B00JVQ7QTM", "B002CTJW0G", "B000YENUI6", "B000035P5I", "B000F5WR4W", "B002CWKU3G", "B00DRCY9UA", "B000053VBA", "B000FS9ULC", "B000QXDCLK", "B00000GHZK"], "bought_together": ["B00AEFYE08", "1558908390"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000E40QC4", "B000XJD34S", "B00005JLG1", "B0001FGBUW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 107652}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.66, "brand": "UNIVERSAL", "asin": "0783230443", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GPMV986DL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Clockers"}

{"description": "Practically a nonstop brawl between pirates and anybody who gets in their path, this lighthearted, high-energy 1976 movie set in 18th century Jamaica is short on an actual story but thick with stunts and swordplay. Robert Shaw stars as the bawdy, swaggering pirate Red Nel Lynch, whose lusty crew of thieves comes to the aid of Lynch's right-hand man and close pal (James Earl Jones), then helps a beleaguered noblewoman (Genevieve Bujold) whose father and property have been seized by a local tyrant (Peter Boyle). Plot details are pretty much relegated to filling in the spaces between rollicking scenes of flying fists and gleaming blades, and a sort-of love story between Shaw and Bujold never gets the chance to go anywhere for all the orchestrated scuffling. Boyle's performance as a Basil Rathbone-style villain has got to be the least persuasive role of his career, but there are compensations, particularly Bujold's feisty turn as the heroine and a kooky scene in which Shaw and Jones amuse each other by trading dirty limericks. Directed by James Goldstone (Winning). The DVD release includes production notes, cast and filmmakers' bios, a theatrical trailer, and Web links.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000FGFBM6", "B000H5U6AC", "B000NQRR1G", "B0043X1FLS", "B0001I56FK", "B000N3NNP8", "B00KIZY3XW", "B000N3T0GO", "B00A33J90G", "B000FFJ83A", "B006H3KQKI", "0792844017", "B0047BXQZY", "B003BJODK0", "B007RMQ4MM", "B00IS6WQ2S", "B000095WW6", "B00IXPWGIS", "B00A33J8R0", "B00441GYSS", "B008NNY8IG", "B003ASU2V6", "B008LYCDW0", "B00005JMR7", "B0057FGCR8", "B0006B2A6U", "B0096PBCFC", "B00JG88XD8", "B001TPGNBK", "B003YWPM2W", "B00CV1PG32", "B000062XF2", "B000E5N6KW", "B004LGGXI2", "B000BGQUG6", "B0033PSH86", "B00004TX5G", "B005HIBWPM", "B00004W5SS", "B0007R4TR6", "B00GICP84W", "B0007ZEOCS", "B003L16F7C", "B00DJYKGKS", "B000063K2R", "B009D4H0G6", "B00004TJJV", "B0001Z37HM", "B0016KCCCC", "B007XTDXF0", "B00B4HLY8K", "B0016LFG2O", "B000BYY0TM", "B000OT6V0U", "B00AFEYS9A", "B00GOHZLDO", "B000E8QVBU", "B0048MD8KU", "B001LMAK6A", "B000H1RFSM", "B000067FP4", "B00083FZFY", "B007XTDW4W", "B00005JMR6", "B009AGEZKQ", "B00546PXNY", "B005E7SF7O", "B0001I55XI", "B004VT9JMG", "B00004Y87L", "B00AEFXT7W", "B0007MAO0C", "B00003L9BB", "B001B73Q34", "B0045HCJ8A", "B002DH20YM", "0783230591", "B000RF7XYY", "B001CQONHM", "B000FBHCTG", "B00005JLJC", "B003YW382S", "B000H30AQY", "B000FC2HRM", "B0036BDQ7Y", "B000PC6Z48", "B000KJU13M"], "bought_together": ["B000FGFBM6", "B000NQRR1G"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000H5U6AC", "B000NQRR1G", "B000N3T0GO", "B000FFJ83A"]}, "price": 12.98, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 113733}, "asin": "0783230516", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51BQWA7YBQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Swashbuckler"}

{"description": "Here's another gritty independent film that tries to invade Tarantino territory by casting Christopher Walken--that most reliable of indie-film actors--as a Mobster who gets chummy with a group of preppie-like young men and becomes the victim of a kidnapping scheme. One of the kidnappers (Henry Thomas) has a sister who's been abducted by another group of kidnappers, and they've bagged Walken for his Mob connections and negotiating power. What follows is a game of psychological strategy in which the desperate group of guys slowly lose their advantage to the smarter, more experienced gangster--even though they've got Walken tied to a chair. The situation turns volatile when the young men start to doubt the wisdom of their strategy and suspect betrayal within the group, andSuicide Kingsturns into a talky, repetitious thriller only partially redeemed by Denis Leary's cagey role as Walken's Mob lieutenant. The movie's a showcase for its cast of rising talent (including Jay Mohr, Jeremy Sisto, Johnny Galecki, and Sean Patrick Flanery), but not even Walken can hold it all together. What's best about the film is Leary's sinister presence in a peripheral role and Walken's trademark villainy, here toned down to a steady, simmering menace.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0001FGBUW", "B00000IQC9", "B002NO4ISG", "B00004ZBVF", "B0002I84EE", "B00007ELER", "B00008977D", "B0006Q94A0", "B000P0J0D8", "B007REV4LQ", "B002TZS57E", "B000Q66QG0", "B00382S9MS", "B004UVYQYQ", "B000UO4F7U", "B00005QJHP", "B0000A2ZTZ", "B005JJCMOO", "B000N8UXU6", "B00AEFXR8I", "B00005V9HQ", "B00005Q4CT", "B002665I8K", "B00062IESC", "B00011CZRE", "B000AGTPTG", "B0006N2DS8", "B00BLF9FYA", "B00008R9M3", "B000UNYK44", "B000GGSMC6", "B00682LSNM", "B00008RH3L", "B000CEXF5Q", "6305327041", "B000IY04Q8", "B00007E8UI", "B00004ZETA", "B004LS6CN6", "B000093FLA", "B00J5G1P2W", "6305313687", "B004U7MR14", "B002AF4Y9G", "B000CNESTE", "B0000AMJEK", "B0029EW7BA", "B009Z3PX0U", "B0012IX35I", "B006TTC5HC", "B004SIP95G", "B000F5GNX8", "B0009A40EI", "B00FGVS0D2", "B005YCEI9S", "B000063K1A", "B006TTC5DQ", "B0006BGXP4", "B00008975Z", "1594742596", "B000067J1O", "0767802519", "0783117140", "B000XPU66U", "B00000IRE6", "B00GS08Y3Q", "B00004YA67", "B00AEBBA4K", "B004CWLRF4", "B00000JNBX", "0792845811", "B004FQX5B6", "B00C2CDJ34", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B000UR9QXK", "B0001US7CC", "B008M6MG42", "B000FIMG7C", "0780631536", "B0009U7LOO", "B00005V9HH", "630542845X", "B00003CY1G", "B0012EM5CY", "B00C3JUJJS", "B002ZG99H2", "B0007WFXLW", "B00D9EJGAY", "B002ZG99N6", "B000P0J09M", "B0000DBJ2D", "B000069I1H", "0767818024", "076785344X", "B000W4TGIQ", "B0057ZAA6W", "B000VDDDVE", "B00CX7TOOG", "B00007LB4C", "B000GI3KGC"], "bought_together": ["B0001FGBUW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0001FGBUW", "B007REV4LQ", "B000P0J0AG", "B0006Q94A0"]}, "price": 9.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 211655}, "asin": "0784011516", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DP0899DFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Suicide Kings"}
{"description": "This artfully constructed five-part series offers chilling evidence that  American democracy has become a convenient lie; that a conspiratorial coup  d'&eacute;tat removed a sitting president and then hid that fact from the  American people. This sounds like the stuff of wild-eyed paranoia, but these  filmmakers did their homework well--interviews include levelheaded witnesses,  suspicious government agents, and Dallas cops present in Dealey Plaza on  November 22, 1963. Some of the \"proof\" (especially in Episode&nbsp;2, \"The  Forces of Darkness\") seems a bit far-fetched, but the sheer number of  unexplained facts is riveting. An autopsy attendant describes a procedure  botched by meddling Secret Service agents. A deaf-mute eyewitness shares his  recollection of uniformed men hiding a rifle and leaving the site of the  assassination unchallenged. Eisenhower's security chief, present at the  shooting, discusses fatal safety lapses--as well as mysterious shots coming from  the opposite direction of the Texas School Book Depository. District Attorney  Jim Garrison points out that Lee Harvey Oswald, a Marine assigned to Russian  reconnaissance, operated a \"Communist\" organization out of a government  intelligence office. Senator Ralph Yarbrough, present in the motorcade, tells of  Kennedy's order to recall the troops from Vietnam--an order rescinded by the  Pentagon three days after his death. But the most powerful elements of this  documentary are the most personal, as hardened cops confess to lasting  nightmares, as senatorial investigators tearfully recall the moment they  realized the official story did not match the facts, and as simple bystanders  share their lasting grief at having witnessed the gory death of America's  innocence.--Grant Balfour", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 709018}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "title": "The Men Who Killed Kennedy [VHS]", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0032LV4MM", "B00AMHFPK6", "B002PTVMWO", "193806710X", "B002PTVMX8", "B00005JMA5", "B004FQX59I", "0615300995"], "also_viewed": ["B000BT96PK", "B000KAD9SU", "1626363137"]}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41VVEB24WGL._SY300_.jpg", "asin": "0788600931"}
{"description": "In Hayao Miyazaki's magicalKiki's Delivery Service, a 13-year-old girl meets the world head on as she spends her first year soloing as an apprentice witch. Kiki (Kirsten Dunst) is still a little green and plenty headstrong, but also resourceful, imaginative, and determined. With her trusty wisp of a cat Jiji (a gently subdued Phil Hartman) by her side she's ready to take on the world, or at least the quaintly European seaside village she's chosen as her new home. Miyazaki's gentle rhythm and meandering narrative capture the easy pulse of real life (even if his subject is a girl flying high upon a broomstick) and charts the everyday struggles and growing pains of his plucky heroine with sensitivity and understanding. Beautifully detailed animation and the rich designs of the picture-postcard seaside town of red-tiled roofs and cobblestone streets only add to the sense of wonder. This charming animated fantasy is a wholesome, life-affirming picture that doesn't speak down to kids or up to adults.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JLET", "6303118240", "B00005JKYF", "B00004T37H", "6302526574", "B00000ICHA", "155890641X", "0788812408", "6300274268", "B00005JLEU", "B000CDGVOE", "0788802194", "B00005JKDQ", "6302320402", "6302642248", "B0006J28BO", "0788803743", "6304089767", "6304100507", "B0001XAPY2", "6304978286", "6301390725", "630273780X", "6303983812", "6304290888", "B0001I55VK", "6304500831", "B000035Z2S", "0788811002", "6302961572", "B002ZTQVHK", "B00005RDVV", "6303929338", "B000CDGVOO", "6303122647", "6303314015", "B00005JKX3", "B00000JS61", "6302158095", "6305319138", "6300274195", "6301757874", "0788810995", "B00003CWPW", "B00003CXBK", "0788812440", "6305009589", "B00004R99N", "B00004REYY", "6305229449", "B000035Z46", "B002ZTQV8Y", "B0045L3SNQ", "B00005BCOU", "B00B1RB942", "B00008AOX7", "6303326781", "0788810448", "6302313937", "6303442447", "0788812548", "B000063V8N", "6305318867", "6303392350", "B00001YX9H", "B00000J2KK", "6304293968", "6305093016", "6304311834", "6305515042", "B00008X5J8", "6303394345", "B000BD18HK", "0788810634", "6303439330", "B0000214F7", "B00000G3AV"], "bought_together": ["B00005JLET", "B00005JKYF"], "also_viewed": ["6303118240", "B00005JKYF", "6301991311", "6302961572", "B00005JLET", "6302320402", "6304500831", "6302787068", "6303314015", "0788812408", "6303929338", "B00004R99N", "B00CSYRHG6", "B000CDGVOE", "6303534422", "0788806270", "6302158095", "B002ZTQVHK", "6304978286", "155890641X", "B000CDGVOO", "6305009589", "B00004R99I", "6302642248", "6304400551", "6303983812", "B00003CXQX", "0788810634", "6300274195", "0790748266", "B00FLIEWJG", "6304290888", "B002ZTQVGQ", "B00003CXBK", "B00000ICHI", "B00003CXHR", "6303394345", "1558906150", "B004CRR9G0", "6304400225", "078881172X", "0788810995", "6304501153", "0788810448", "0788805533", "6303804357", "6300275310", "B006LLY8LY", "0788812440", "0788812807", "B002ZTQV8Y", "0788812181", "B00003CX7L", "6300274268", "0788805843", "B00005K9OB", "6302221684", "B00009YXAW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 193664}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 21.5, "brand": "", "asin": "078881107X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515F75Y02QL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Kiki's Delivery Service [VHS]"}
{"description": "The most viscerally frightening and disturbing homicidal-maniac picture sinceThe Silence of the Lambs,Sevenis based on an idea that's both gruesome and ingenious. A serial killer forces each of his victims to die by acting out one of the seven deadly sins. The murder scene is then artfully arranged into a grotesque tableau, a graphic illustration of each mortal vice. From the jittery opening credits to the horrifying (and seemingly inescapable) concluding twist, director David Fincher immerses us in a murky urban twilight where everything seems to be rotting, rusting, or molding; the air is cold and heavy with dread. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt are the detectives who skillfully track down the killer--all the while unaware that he has been closing in on them, as well. Gwyneth Paltrow and Kevin Spacey are also featured, but it is director Fincher and the ominous, overwhelmingly oppressive atmosphere of doom that he creates that are the real stars of the film.

{"description": "Paul Newman gives one of the defining performances of his career, and cemented his place as a beautiful-rebel screen icon playing the stubbornly tough and independent title character inCool Hand Luke. And before he became familiar as a sidekick in 1970s disaster movies (Earthquakeand theAirportmovies), George Kennedy won an Oscar for playing Dragline, the brutal chain-gang boss who tries to beat loner Luke's cool out of him. It's a classic rebel-against-the-repressive-institution story in the line ofOne Flew over the Cuckoo's NestorThe Shawshank Redemption. Certain moments have become classics--particularly the hardboiled egg-eating contest, and the immortal line (drooled by Strother Martin, as a sadistic redneck prison officer), &quot;What we have here is a failure to communicate.&quot; And don't forget, Luke is also the source of the oft-quoted driving ditty, &quot;I don't care if it rains or freezes, long as I have my plastic Jesus, right here on the dashboard of my car...&quot; He is cool, all right.

{"description": "When Warner Brothers was unable to secure the rights to Richard Preston's terrifying nonfiction bookThe Hot Zone(purchased by a rival studio), they took the basic idea of a fatal virus on the loose in the U.S., added Dustin Hoffman and director Wolfgang Petersen (Das Boot), and produced an unusual thriller--a surprise hit--calledOutbreak. The other picture, slated to star Robert Redford and Jodie Foster, fell through. The premise ofOutbreak, which owes something to Elia Kazan's 1950 plague-scare movie,Panic in the Streets, is as terrifying as it is timely. As developers slash their way deeper into the previously unexplored tropical rainforests, they are exposed to radically new forms of life, including diseases, that in these days of commonplace international travel could turn into deadly epidemics almost before we know it. Hoffman's character and his estranged wife (Rene Russo) are disease experts called in to identify the unknown killer, which was carried into the country by an illegally smuggled monkey.  The best sequence shows the disease spreading--through recycled air on a passenger jet, or a sneeze in a crowded movie theater.  The final chase is pretty conventional, but the cast is terrific, including Morgan Freeman, Kevin Spacey, Donald Sutherland, Cuba Gooding Jr., J.T. Walsh, and Zakes Mokae.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0069UP2PI", "B000PE0GXM", "B0002V7OI8", "0783225547", "B00E8G5HQE", "B0001CNRAM", "B002O3Z50G", "B00005JMXX", "B00000G3PA", "B0006GANOQ", "0767805712", "B00AEFXPSK", "B000P0J0C4", "B00005AQMJ", "6304806434", "B0045HCJFS", "B00008G8M4", "B00008438U", "B000MZGN40", "B00015YVDG", "B002AT8K9W", "0783225733", "0800141806", "B001OQCV2E", "0790732149", "B000EOTEM2", "B00AEFYCW8", "6305428506", "0783240295", "B00AEFYUQQ", "B00AEFXPMG", "B000JYW5BE", "6304765258", "B003AWRMBA", "6304711891", "B00000IQC4", "B000EHSVPK", "B00005ATZT", "B000CEV3M8", "B00AEFY6PQ", "B001B3LIOC", "0783226888", "B00AEFY0F2", "B000N4RAS8", "6305090564", "B00003CWU3", "0767803434", "B00026ZG10", "B00AEFXW8I", "B000U1ZV8K", "6305213283", "B002O3Z4WK", "B0015NORDW", "B0000AZT71", "B00008OE4W", "B00004STDN", "B00000IQV7", "B00AEFXT1S", "079073639X", "B000NTMA0Q", "B002NZK5VO", "B0068FZ0O2", "B00000IQW2", "B00008K76U", "B00BTYNXJG", "B00000IQVQ", "B000QUCRB4", "B002NZK5R8", "B00067BCBI", "B00004BZIY", "B004XVMCN0", "0790736411", "B002GHHHNI", "B00008G8LY", "B000O77SRC", "0783233523", "B001OFM2TC", "B0043X1FL8", "B00005JL78", "B00AFEYS9A", "B002GHHHKQ", "B0006D3HGA", "B00AEFY4CG", "B000EHSVOG", "B00004TS0H", "B002TZS5GU", "B0001WTULW", "B00AEFYXQI", "B00011CZRE", "B00CSW0A8A", "B000ETRA5U", "B0006HBZXS", "B00004Z4WR", "B00005RDAN", "B00005JPD0", "B0000C1XSS", "B000P0J0EM", "B001KRVLCI", "0800177029", "630471193X"], "bought_together": ["B0069UP2PI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003BV8ICM", "B0069UP2PI", "B002O3Z50G", "B001OQCV2E"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 142535}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.99, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "0790731401", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41VVBMHQ97L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Outbreak (Snap Case)"}

{"description": "There were two movies about murder and the U.S. presidency released in 1997, and when you compare it toAbsolute Power, this one is clearly the lesser of the two. That doesn't mean it's a bad movie, but it does make it a mildly disappointing one, and it illustrates the hazards of crafting a film to fit the persona of its leading man. In this case, you've got Wesley Snipes, a young, savvy man of action, playing a Washington, D.C., police detective assigned to investigate the murder of a woman in the White House. The president's son is a prime suspect, but there's a cover-up underway that forces Snipes to intensify his investigation beyond normal parameters. For a while at least, this makesMurder at 1600a sharp and interesting film, and while the national security advisor (Alan Alda) seems highly cooperative (but don't be so sure), Snipes meets a secret service member (Diane Lane) who shares his belief in a high-level conspiracy. Unfortunately, that's when the film takes a downward plunge, resorting to a series of thriller clich&eacute;s including an unlikely chase through secret tunnels beneath the White House. We're not suggesting this couldn't happen, but it's the kind of thing you typically see in movies that have run out of original ideas before they're over. Kinda makes you want to watchAbsolute Poweragain, doesn't it?--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002AT8KA6", "0790736411", "B000B8GT92", "B003ASLJIQ", "B0045HCJFS", "6305428115", "B000JYW5BE", "B00AEFXT1S", "B00000ILBN", "B000CEV3M8", "B000055Y0Y", "B002AT8K9W", "B001B3LIOC", "B00015YVDG", "0783240295", "B00096S49Y", "B00AEFXYJA", "B000ENC5YW", "B002O3Z4WK", "B000U1ZV4Y", "B00AEFYUQQ", "B002NZK5UU", "B002AS464Q", "0767803434", "B00003CXMV", "B000QUCRB4", "B004IK30MI", "B00AP2DC94", "B00441GYXI", "B000NTMA0Q", "B00004STDN", "B00DHD933W", "B000OT6V0K", "6304765258", "B002GHHHME", "0792159659", "B000YCPUWW", "6304711891", "B000U1ZV8K", "B00008K76U", "B000PISZ7M", "B002AT8KAG", "B003ASLJJU", "B00029RT9E", "B004F7BGBG", "B00005JA9F", "B0009FU0ZG", "B00AEBB9UK", "B002GIBVVG", "B0029F253E", "B00009L1TA", "0783226888", "B00AEFYW64", "0780618548", "B0002V7OI8", "B00AEFY6PQ", "B0045HCIWW", "B004GJYRK0", "B00005JL8F", "B000BYY11Y", "B00AEFYF2K", "B00005ATZT", "6304806434", "B00151QYXU", "B001AK3S4E", "B0050MB5NO", "B00026ZG10", "6304884400", "B00003CXGV", "B002NZK5R8", "B000MGBSE4", "B0050MB4OO", "B003AWRMC4", "B0045HCJ8K", "B002NZK5RI", "0792833848", "B0076YFJUY", "6305213283", "B0006GANOQ", "6304806450", "B00008G8M4", "B0045HCJGC", "B000G5SILC", "B0000542CK", "B000HEVZ80", "0767810872", "B00000I1JZ", "B00007AJG1", "B002NZK5VO", "B00061I294", "B00000JDIQ", "B00005UQ9T", "B000GFLKF8", "B000HT38IK", "0783110871", "B00000G3PA", "0783226934", "B007FQXEWI", "B00014NEZI", "B002O3Z4ZW"], "bought_together": ["B002AT8KA6", "6305428115"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002AT8KA6", "B000JYW5BE", "6305428115", "B000CEV3M8"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 18956}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.99, "brand": "SNIPES,WESLEY", "asin": "0790732149", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Z1X5Z08AL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Murder at 1600 (Snap Case Packaging)"}

{"description": "Philip Kaufman's intimate epic about theMercuryastronauts (based on Tom Wolfe's book) was one of the most ambitious and spectacularly exciting movies of the 1980s.  It surprised almost everybody by not becoming a smash hit. By all rights, the film should have been every bit the success thatApollo 13would later become;The Right Stuffis not only just as thrilling, but it is also a bigger and better movie. Combining history (both established and revisionist), grand mythmaking (and myth puncturing), adventure, melodrama, behind-the-scenes dish, spectacular visuals, and a down-to-earth sense of humor,The Right Stuffchronicles NASA's efforts to put a man in orbit. Such an achievement would be the first step toward President Kennedy's goal of reaching the moon, and, perhaps most important of all, would win a crucial public relations/morale victory over the Soviets, who had delivered a stunning blow to American pride by launchingSputnik, the first satellite. The movie contrasts the daring feats of the unsung test pilots--one of whom, Chuck Yeager, embodied more than anyone else the skill and spirit of Wolfe's title--against the heavily publicized (and sanitized) accomplishments of theMercuryastronauts. Through no fault of their own, the spacemen became prisoners of the heroic images the government created for them in order to capture the public's imagination. The casting is inspired; the film features Sam Shepard as the legendary Yeager, Ed Harris as John Glenn, Dennis Quaid as &quot;Gordo&quot; Cooper, Scott Glenn as Alan Shepard, Fred Ward as Gus Grissom, Scott Wilson as Scott Crossfield, and Pamela Reed and Veronica Cartwright are superb in their thankless roles as astronauts' wives.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783225733", "B0006FYOTC", "B002O3Z4QQ", "B001BEK8CY", "B002NHX1YK", "B003AWRMBA", "0312427565", "B000XJ5TPE", "B00008K76U", "B00005J760", "B000CEXEWA", "B004L9GMBC", "B002GHHHKQ", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00004XPPC", "B001O4C6K8", "B0045HCJ9O", "B00BTYOYK8", "B000FTCLR6", "B0002V7OI8", "B00005JPLE", "0792838408", "0812992520", "B00080ETMM", "B000055Y0X", "B00AEFYBA6", "B000V7O0DU", "B004AOECXI", "B0015NORDW", "B000EHSVS2", "B00371QQ2U", "0767802470", "B00066FBQG", "B00A33J8YS", "B0006B2A42", "B00080ZG10", "B00319ECI8", "B00AEFXVOI", "B00008G8M4", "B007N31YH0", "B00AEFYENK", "B003ASLJRC", "B004FQX5A2", "B0000JBALO", "B000E1NXJ0", "B00004U2MS", "B000MNOX94", "B0026IQTR2", "B00003CWU3", "B00000G3PA", "B0026VBOJC", "B008JZRMQI", "B00003CXHJ", "0553256742", "B00008G8LY", "B00005T7HZ", "0743200799", "0553050931", "B000FZETR0", "B000EHSVSC", "B0000694Z3", "0783225547", "B0002WZTOI", "B002O3Z50G", "1439148813", "6305428514", "B0068FZ0GK", "B00003CXA6", "B0001NBMH6", "B00026L9CU", "B000YAF4MA", "B002GHHHPQ", "B0087ZG7HK", "B000KX0IOA", "B0001US66Y"], "bought_together": ["0783225733", "B0006FYOTC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0783225733", "B002ZNJXP8", "B003AWRMBA", "B0002WZTOI"]}, "price": 15.95, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 149633}, "asin": "0790731541", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516l1sshrEL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Right Stuff"}
{"description": "Iconoclastic director Robert Altman (Nashville,M.A.S.H.), deconstructs and demythologizes Hollywood's typically romantic vision of the Old West in this haunting, breathtaking masterpiece. A stranger, McCabe (Warren Beatty's best performance), the film's nonheroic protagonist, rides into a dead northwest mountain town (to the mournful sounds of Leonard Cohen), possessing ambitious entrepreneurial dreams of expansion. As the town grows, Mrs. Miller (Julie Christie's finest role, as well), a tough madam, arrives and convinces McCabe to join her in a partnership. Neither are typical Western archetypes: McCabe's an insecure braggart, bumbling lover, and horrible businessman, while Mrs. Miller, hardly a whore with a heart of gold, favors her opium pipe to her partner's romantic advances. Altman, meanwhile, buries these central characters within the town's complex, richly detailed tapestry of characters, preferring to eavesdrop on their overlapping conversations and study the bleak, harsh conditions of their lifestyles. At its core, the film addresses the sacrifices of individualism needed in order to build a community, an American concept that the independent Altman views with skeptical irony. The inevitable final shoot-out underscores the theme. Because McCabe refuses to sell the town he built to a corporation, hired bounty hunters are sent. Instead of a showdown at high noon, the finale--one of Altman's most beautiful set pieces--takes place in the snow, guerilla warfare style. As McCabe runs and hides for his life, the town he created preoccupies itself with saving a burning church instead of their creator, while Mrs. Miller, stoned and grinning, detaches herself from either concern. Cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond captures the town's brutal textures in luminous Cinemascope.--Dave McCoy", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004FQX5B6", "6305237115", "6301966015", "1555265952", "6301564456", "630025111X", "630442972X", "6303593135", "6301976126", "6301963911", "0792837339", "0783217528", "0792839153", "6301966430"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 224934}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.95, "brand": "", "asin": "0790741067", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51MPYTP5R3L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Mccabe &amp; Mrs. Miller [VHS]"}

{"description": "The fourth Pink Panther film with Peter Sellers and directed by Blake Edwards is easily the most over-the-top, but it's still pretty entertaining. The story finds Clouseau's former boss (Herbert Lom) totally insane after years of enduring the bumbling detective, and sequestered in a castle with a death-ray gun. Clouseau has to stop him from using the weapon on the world, and his efforts to do so make for some choice, Edwards-style slapstick. The quotient of destruction (a Clouseau staple) is higher than average, but there is also real wit--particularly in a final scene where Lom re-creates his most famous role as the monster from the 1962Phantom of the Opera.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792834895", "6301976835", "6302884438", "0792834879"], "bought_together": ["0792834895", "6301976835"], "also_viewed": ["0792834879", "6302884438"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 400696}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.51, "brand": "", "asin": "0792834852", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51SD6YS2FCL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Pink Panther Strikes Again [VHS]"}
{"description": "Well, bless my beautiful hide! Director Stanley Donen invests this rollicking musical with a hearty exuberance. Howard Keel, with his big-as-all-outdoors baritone, stars as a bold \"mountain man\" living in the Oregon woods who brings home a bride (plucky songbird soprano Jane Powell) to his six slovenly brothers. Taming the rambunctious brood, Jane proceeds to make gentlemen of them so they can woo sweethearts of their own. But old habits die hard: their flirting gives way to fighting in the film's celebrated barn-raising scene, a lively acrobatic dance number exuberantly choreographed by Michael Kidd. Big brother chimes in with his own brand of advice--an old-fashioned kidnapping! Donen manages to get away with such a politically incorrect plot by investing the boys with a innocent sweetness, most notably the youngest brother played with genial earnestness by Rusty (Russ) Tamblyn (pre-West Side Story). This modest production became a huge hit and remains one of MGM's best-loved musical comedies, an energetic, high-kicking classic.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00000F6D1", "630233683X", "6304178352", "6305282927", "6303444202", "6304151306", "B00004TZS4", "0790744759", "0792837533", "6303494390", "6302363268", "0792837614", "6304400551", "6304117752", "6300246787", "6301390725", "0792837630", "6303854311", "6300275310", "B00000I1EM", "6300269566", "B00004TRD5", "0792840844", "0792837649", "6301976932", "B0002B15Y2", "6300216195", "6304331851", "B0074JOUHE", "0792837096", "0790741091", "6301586026", "B0000040EO", "6300215717", "B000006GTO", "6304005490", "6300182118", "6302136261", "6300215598", "0800100832", "6302363292", "6303929966", "6300184889", "6302241103", "0783235593"], "bought_together": ["B00000F6D1", "630233683X"], "also_viewed": ["B001PO550A", "B00004TZS4", "B000HT3PGU", "6301976932", "B0007Z0O9U", "6303215734", "0783235593", "B0000040EO", "6304178352", "6305282927", "0792837614", "6304151306", "0792837533", "6300215695", "0792837630", "630233683X", "6303494390", "B00EQIYZTO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 331822}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.95, "brand": "", "asin": "0792837592", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51G22RBC2ML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Seven Brides for Seven Brothers [VHS]"}

{"description": "This was the first James Bond adventure produced after the success ofStar Wars, so it jumped on the sci-fi bandwagon by combining the suave appeal of Agent 007 (once again played by Roger Moore) with enough high-tech hardware and special effects to make Luke Skywalker want to join Her Majesty's Secret Service. After the razzle-dazzle ofThe Spy Who Loved Me, this attempt to latch onto a trend proved to be a case of overkill, even though it brought back the steel-toothed villain Jaws (Richard Kiel) and scored a major hit at the box office. This time Bond is up against a criminal industrialist named Drax (Michel Lonsdale) who wants to control the world from his orbiting space station. In keeping with his well-groomed style, Bond thwarts this maniacal Neo-Hitler's scheme with the help of a beautiful, sleek-figured scientist (played by Lois Chiles with all the vitality of a department-store mannequin). There's a grand-scale climax involving space shuttles and ray guns, but despite the film's popular success, this is one Bond adventure that never quite gets off the launching pad. It's as if the caretakers of the James Bond franchise had forgotten that it's Bond--and not a barrage of gizmos and gadgets (including a land-worthy Venetian gondola)--that fuels the series' success. Despite Moore's passive performance (which Pauline Kael described as &quot;like an office manager who is turning into dead wood but hanging on to collect his pension&quot;),Moonrakerhad no problem attracting an appreciative audience, and there are even a few renegade Bond-philes who consider it one of their favorites.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000RPCK1K", "B000NIBUR6", "B000M53GLS", "B000RPCK24", "B000M53GN6", "B000RPCK1A", "B000RPCK0Q", "B000NDEXPM", "B000NIBUS0", "B001R10BN2", "B000M53GMW", "B000RPCK1U", "B000M53GNG", "B000NIBURQ", "B000M53GM2", "B000NDEXPC", "B00004RG62", "B001EDVNNU", "B000M53GMC", "B00004WEJZ", "B001PPLIEG", "B00AQSN7HE", "B007REV4T8", "B00005JL0I", "B009PN18R2", "B004BR7XLM", "B008YAPQX4", "B000067J15", "B00AZFECBS", "B00006BH8G", "B00AZFECJU", "B009RO9LKK", "B00AZFECL8", "B00000BLFI", "B009L6VWRO", "B000HT3PF6", "B009NUUBBQ", "B001AQT0WW", "B0000BYRO9", "B0001ENZLQ", "B009NUTPAO", "B009NUV0E8", "B0014C2FX8", "B009L6UDUG", "B00008K76U", "B005LAII44", "B00AZMFJYA", "B001U6YI9W", "B00AZFECS6", "B000O599YY", "B00AVWIQZS", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B007STBUHI", "B0045HCJ9O", "B004OB2EYQ", "B003Q6D2B4", "B00005PJ8S", "B004EPYZUS", "B008JFUO72", "1612185452", "B00005ATZT", "B00DZFKNFO", "B0000BYRO7", "B000BZISSU", "B00001U0BN", "B00AEFYENK", "B0014Z4ON4", "B001AQMBIC", "B0000UJL96", "B004L9GMBC", "B001PO6FF4", "B000FO0AA6", "B0000AUHOH", "B00009NHC0", "0792839064", "B000MGTQ7U", "B00005JLRQ", "B001AQO3WO", "0783226039", "B00AEBB8VK", "B00005JKU0", "B0013LL2Z2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000RPCK24", "B000M53GN6", "B001R10BN2", "B000NDEXPM"]}, "price": 11.94, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 283251}, "asin": "0792838033", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/513267YK57L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Moonraker THX Edition"}
{"description": "Truly ridiculous but somehow moving, this right-wing paranoid fantasy by John Milius (The Wind and the Lion) from 1984 concerns a Soviet takeover of the United States and a band of ragtag adolescents who metamorphose into freedom fighters. One can laugh at the notion of Nicaraguans, Cubans, and Russians having worked out a master plan to invade America, but Milius's account of how such a grim day affects a small Western town really does get under one's skin. The cast--most of whom were not yet stars (Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey had probably never heard of a script calledDirty Dancingat the time)--are quite persuasive as nice kids who come to recognize the tragedy of their lost innocence through fierce, uncompromising struggle. Powers Boothe is very good as a pilot who briefly comes to their aid, and Harry Dean Stanton is stirring as a solid working man and father who represents the virtues his sons are fighting for.

{"description": "After the cultish success ofRepo Man, maverick director Alex Cox made the film that remains his masterpiece--a loud, brash, abrasive, painful, funny, and utterly brilliant screen biography of British punk rocker Sid Vicious and his American girlfriend Nancy Spungen. As played to perfection by Gary Oldman and Chloe Webb, Sid and Nancy are made for each other, serving their mutual strengths and weaknesses and rising with the punk-rock fame of Sid's group, the Sex Pistols, while falling into the ultimately lethal pit of drug abuse. Cox doesn't pull any punches or compromise the unsavory aspects of this passionate love story, so the film presents a harsh mix of emotional and physical anguish tempered by the very poignant and genuine love shared by its tormented central characters. Through it all, the film emerges as an intimate and yet oddly epic chronicle of punk's glory days of anarchic sex, drugs and rock & roll. It's as dynamic and confidently directed as any screen biography before or since, no less fascinating for its unpleasant aspects as for the touching emotions at its very human core.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000065RCD"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 434106}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.09, "brand": "", "asin": "0792839641", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Y5PCBCMSL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Sid &amp; Nancy [VHS]"}

{"description": "Robert Duvall plays a veteran street cop assigned to a Los Angeles gang unit. He takes a headstrong young cop (Sean Penn) under his wing as a partner and shows him the ropes on Watts's mean streets. Penn soon realizes that his testosterone-fueled ways and hair-trigger temper won't get him very far when dealing with the gang-ridden neighborhoods of L.A.Colorsis a landmark movie in several respects: it helped bring director Dennis Hopper back into the spotlight after years of self-induced obscurity. Its success at the box office forced Los Angeles's gang problems into the public consciousness and prefigured the next wave of \"hood\" movies (Boyz N the Hood,Menace II Society,New Jack City) by several years. Though the late-'80s milieu is a bit dated,Colorsis still a vivid, absorbing film. Hopper and screenwriter Michael Schiffer give all the characters a very human dimension and go to great lengths to show gang life from both the cops' and the gangsters' points of view. Wisely, they stir in elements of the cop drama, buddy movie, and action genres, leavened with a bit of humor here and there, while keeping a social conscience. Duvall is excellent as always, as the sympathetic cop, and Penn brings a great deal of depth to what could be an unlikable character. Violent, unsettling, and highly recommended.--Jerry Renshaw", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302256615", "6300183211", "B00003CXE6", "6301427076", "B00005JKEC", "6301963725", "0800125762", "B000006ORX", "6302722764", "0792839846", "0790734516", "6302787564", "6304214502", "6300183483", "6302945089", "B00000IO4G", "0790748169", "6303313345"], "bought_together": ["6302256615"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 438985}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.0, "brand": "", "asin": "0792841778", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51SDK94VK1L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Colors [VHS]"}
{"description": "In this 1942 melodrama, founded on the novel by Olivia Higgins Prouty (who also wrote the novel on whichStella Dallaswas based), Bette Davis stars as Charlotte Vale, a dowdy, repressed woman who, overwhelmed by her domineering mother, is on the verge of a nervous breakdown. She finds help at a sanitarium from a kind psychiatrist (Claude Rains), who turns her into a beautiful, confident woman. As a new person, she takes a pleasure cruise, where she meets Jerry (Paul Henreid), an architect trapped in an unhappy marriage, saddled with a troubled daughter. The two fall in love, but, of course, the romance is doomed. Yet their paths cross on occasion, and, despite their feelings, Charlotte finds satisfaction in helping Jerry's depressed child. The film will seem familiar to new viewers--the campy style was the pattern for many tearjerkers to come, and its most famous line has been oft repeated (\"Don't ask for the moon--we have the stars\"). But the heartstringsaretugged, and as Paul Henreid chivalrously lights two cigarettes and hands one over to the doleful-eyed Davis, pull out the box of tissues--you're gonna need 'em.--Jenny Brown", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00004TX24", "6301797957", "B00000JKNL", "6304359721", "0780614097", "6301967496", "0783222955", "6301972171", "6302548438", "6300208133", "6302278929", "6302779782", "6303364772", "6301978536", "6301965760", "630310245X", "6301973305", "6301045750", "6300183513", "0790743159", "6302354145", "6301968891", "6301973313", "6301798503", "0782006779", "6301670159", "6302000661", "6301977688", "6300181340", "6300268594", "6302413435", "0792844564"], "bought_together": ["B00004TX24"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 415160}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.0, "brand": "", "asin": "0792837134", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51EWBG07ZCL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Now Voyager [VHS]"}

{"description": "Safe in their picturesque chateau behind the front lines, the French general staff passes down a direct order to Colonel Dax (Kirk Douglas): take the Ant Hill at any cost. A blatant suicide mission, the attack is doomed to failure. Covering up their fatal blunder, the generals order the arrest of three innocent soldiers, charging them with cowardice and mutiny. Dax, a lawyer in civilian life, rises to the men's defense but soon realizes that, unless he can prove that the generals were to blame,nothing less than a miracle will save his clients from the firing squad.  A compelling masterpiece from world-class director/writer Stanley Kubrick and screenwriters Calder Willingham and JimThompson, Paths of Glory is a blistering indictment of military politics and \"an unforgettable movie experience\" (Newsweek).", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000KGGJ0Y", "B005152C9G", "B000UJ48SQ", "B00BTYJYR6", "B000UJ48VI", "B000055Y0X", "0783226039", "0792841387", "B007K8ILTW", "B004L9GMBC", "B00004XPPC", "B0013D8LKO", "B000P0J09C", "B00005U8F4", "0143106112", "B00005PJ8T", "6305999872", "B004O724M2", "B0042FDCR2", "B00005AUKD", "B00005ATQB", "B0011FDVGI", "B00006ADD5", "B0049985XW", "0767802470", "0780020707", "B001WLMOL4", "B000O78L0U", "B000UJCAKY", "B0087ZG7OI", "B000HWZ4CA", "B0010YSD7W", "B0046YK4KW", "B00005JPKE", "B00AQ6J64O", "B00D9BNONW", "0792839730", "B004SJVQ4I", "B00005UQ7T", "B00003CXBU", "079284646X", "B003ELKNH2", "B00AEBB89C", "B000G8NXYG", "B000EHSVS2", "B004HHX9XC", "B0002MHE1O", "B00008AOTN", "B005KQVE1S", "B0007TKNLA", "0767830555", "B0000639EU", "B000CNESN0", "B000K0YLZ0", "B005SQ3AO4", "B003ZEQMH8", "B00065GX64", "0792841662", "B00008PC13", "B0006GAOJA", "B002VWNIDG", "B0007Z0NYQ", "B000025RE7", "B002VWNIAY", "B00AEFYSEA", "B000M2E30O", "B00006RCNV", "B002E01MBA", "B000MTEFWS", "B000O599VC", "B00AEFXN9G", "B00DHN8G3U", "B0050FXDDQ", "B000O599ZS", "B000AQKUH2", "6305132917", "B003O7I6SE", "B0000AMRUP", "B006TTC5HC", "B0045HCJTO", "B00008LDO3", "B001DW2BIS", "B007Y1NR1W", "B0007TKNGA", "B00097DY2A", "B000MV90B2", "B0007PALZ2", "B0045HCJ8U", "B000TXNDV6", "B001KXZGO6", "B004NWPY3E", "B0006HBV3C", "0783225903", "B00AEFXG2U", "B00004XPPE", "0783228457", "0792841670", "B003AND1GY", "B008MIMWP8", "B000A2WJBQ"], "bought_together": ["B000KGGJ0Y", "B00BTYJYR6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005152C9G", "B000UJ48SQ", "B000KGGJ0Y", "0783226039"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 21200}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.99, "brand": "DOUGLAS,KIRK", "asin": "0792841409", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51TDZ1EGVPL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Paths of Glory"}

{"description": "By strumming his guitar with words of inspiration, Woody Guthrie instilled hope in the hearts of downtrodden Americans everywhere during the 1930s Depression. Now, the extraordinary life of this legendary balladeer and poet is captured in this \"elegantly crafted, hugely beautiful and interesting film, which reveals loving integrity in every frame\" (Los Angeles Times)! Winner* of two Oscars&#xC2;(r) and starring David Carradine, Bound for Glory features \"magnificent cinematography\" (New York) and an amazing score adaptation.  It's 1936, and the Great Depression is forcing droves of people from the dust bowls of Texas to the alluring green fields of California...and unemployed sign-painter Woody Guthrie is among them. Determined to find a better life out west, Guthrie hitchhikes, hops freight trains and sings his way across America, uplifting the spirits of the poor with his homespun wisdom and fiercely fighting for a better life for all. Featuring classic Guthrie tunes including \"This Land Is Your Land,\" this \"moving, inspiring\" (The Hollywood Reporter) portrait of an American icon is \"one of [the] year's most admirable and triumphant surprises\" (Los Angeles Times)!  *1976: Cinematography, Music (Adaptation Score)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000X1ZPEM", "0452264456", "B000NRRWOM", "B000050IKW", "B0000DJZ8R", "B003B3NV6S", "B001EKP5D2", "B00CBG9SHM", "B000FP2ZY4", "B0018PH3OC", "B00EO2I6T2", "0385333854", "B000000EBR", "0783231032", "0634024051", "B000024ZK7", "B004H2V6BE", "B004CQZFH6", "1604735651", "B0002KPHZQ", "B00004ZBVE", "0062248391", "B0002ERWZ0", "B001VC99HQ", "B000F7CMQI", "B001IHJ988", "B000BMY2LU", "6305081034", "B0000026V0", "B00000JWCQ", "B000093NQZ", "B000TXNDV6", "6305882592", "B0049985XW", "B00097DY2A", "B0007ZEOPK", "B004ULEEQG", "B0012GMZHW", "B00I4X8KU2", "B00000K3TX", "B000X07TLA", "B000001DJY", "B00003CXRM", "B00000IBL1", "B00005AUKD", "B008HFS4XU", "B003VA3JTA", "B000G6BLVA", "B000000EBD", "B000O78L0U", "0792839064", "B00008CMR1", "B0081MEETM", "B000JLTRG8", "B008SAPCAM", "B00K6D1RO4", "B003O7I6SE", "B000KGGJ0Y", "6305999872", "B004LLIRRM", "B0000TG8XY", "0767926889", "B000286RO8", "B00H7KJRVY", "B00AEBB8W4", "0394501527", "B005QIOK70", "B0006Z2KYI", "B00IBKXSKA", "B0002HOEQM", "B00E96AY20", "B002LMOAUQ", "B000A0GP4K", "B00GPWEPZ8", "B0002HOEPS", "B000069JIL", "B00013D580", "B001E1HCRI"], "bought_together": ["B000X1ZPEM", "0452264456"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0452264456", "B000X1ZPEM", "B000NRRWOM", "6305882592"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 15813}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 37.77, "brand": "CARRADINE,DAVID", "asin": "0792843568", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51N98KFG7JL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Bound for Glory"}

Botanist Dr. Charles Decker returns from  Africa with some brand-new plants and an adorable chimpanzee buddy named Konga.  Decker has some revolutionary ideas about \"finding the first link in modern  evolution between plant and animal life,\" but don't think about them too much,  they'll just give you a headache.

Alas, like so many of his horror-movie-scientist brethren, Decker is a cold-hearted, ruthless creep who soon has the superstrong Konga doing his evil bidding. In addition to its guy-in-a-gorilla-suit pleasures,Kongaoffers poorly scaled dolls of the lead characters, fetching giant Venus flytrap puppets, and a genuinely good performance by Michael Gough as the ever more evil Dr. Decker.--Ali Davis", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 685428}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.46, "brand": "", "asin": "0792846729", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51JCCSR4YDL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Konga [VHS]"}

{"description": "Thirteen-year-old Jenna (Shana Dowdeswell) has had enough with the trials of adolescence. In addition to being saddled with a devoted-but-nerdy best friend, Matt (Sean Marquette), she falls victim to one of the dangers of playing Seven Minutes in Heaven with the coolest kids in school: being stranded without a willing make-out partner. Humiliated, Jenna buries herself in the aforementioned make-out closet, wishing she could skip the whole adolescence bit and move straight into adulthood, and miraculously wakes up just weeks away from her 30th birthday. Of course, a lot has changed since going to bed the night before, not the least of which being an impressive set of womanly curves. The new, older Jenna (Jennifer Garner) is a successful magazine editor with friends in high places and a lion's share of potential suitors -- including a hockey-playing boyfriend and a swarthy married man. The problem is that her mind hasn't matured with her body; Jenna not only finds living on her own more terrifying than cool, but is quick to dismiss any male over the age of 14 as \"gross.\" Half excited, half mortified, Jenna seeks out Matt (Mark Ruffalo), whom she learns she had spurned as a teenager in an effort to join the popular crowd.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00006ZXSL", "B00AKGG6JS", "B00005O5CM", "B00AEFXO8Q", "B0015I2RT8", "B001OQCUYI", "B00005JMCW", "B001OQCUZM", "B00003CXSM", "B000J103OI", "B00AEFYM2S", "B002K0WBXW", "B00AEBB8R4", "B000EMGICS", "B004SIP9X8", "B003LSFM6U", "B0000897EG", "B000ELJAEM", "B00AEFY99O", "1401324142", "6304765266", "1416205152", "B00GO37I8Y", "0809229374", "B0001XAR1I", "B0001Z3TXE", "B00005JM55", "B00AEFYWQY", "B00007E2F5", "B0002VYOVI", "B00KS9V6EC", "B000J4QW7W", "B000YDBPAM", "B0007PLLBU", "B001TUZD8O", "B002ZG988M", "B0009OL7Z4", "B004SIP9RO", "B0000ZMGWK", "1400050138", "B0000DZ6N3", "B00AQS803A", "6302077818", "B00006ZXSK", "B00005JN0Z", "B000YAA68C", "B0007LXPBI", "B00E4Z7FQY", "B002P413IC", "B001ASQ9OM", "B006YTGL86", "B00795C5X4", "B00063KGPU", "B000BVM1S2", "B000209KMW", "B000A343RI", "B00062IVN0", "B000P0J0DS", "B00002SSKI", "6305428425", "B003TY2SWC", "B0051GLDVS", "B00008K7AM", "B0071HPOGK", "B0000AKCJK", "B000023VTP", "B00AEBB8YW", "B00006FMUW", "B002XTXG8O", "B00AMEZDJW", "B001AEF6BS", "B00447L4KA", "B000MQC9H4", "6305428042", "B002GOAH1U", "B0036TGSIK", "B002A5EBMQ", "B0000AOV4I", "B001C5LLQ4", "B000324Y98", "B00005JG6N", "6305236569", "B00AEFZ6V4", "B004EPZ070", "B003L20ICE", "B0038N9X3Q", "B00AEBBA2M", "B00005JN3W", "B0075RREYG", "B000F2BNW2", "0783235070", "B0021L8UO4", "0800177258", "B002SYAGNC", "B000HT386M", "B0007P0Y7C", "B000QUU4LY", "B00006ZXSN", "B00AEBB9WI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0013D8LFY", "B002K0WBXW", "B00AKGG6JS", "B001OQCUZM"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 461629}, "asin": "1404918051", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41EO6%2BQ3jvL.jpg", "title": "13 Going on 30: Fun &amp; Flirty Edition"}

{"description": "Director Billy Wilder (Sunset Boulevard) and writer Raymond Chandler (The Big Sleep) adapted James M. Cain's hard-boiled novel into this wildly thrilling story of insurance man Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray), who schemes the perfect murder with the beautiful dame Phyllis Dietrichson (Barbara Stanwyck): kill Dietrichson's husband and make off with the insurance money. But, of course, in these plots things never quite go as planned, and Barton Keyes (Edward G. Robinson) is the wily insurance investigator who must sort things out. From the opening scene you know Neff is doomed, as the story is told in flashback; yet, to the film's credit, this doesn't diminish any of the tension of the movie. This early film noir flick is wonderfully campy by today's standards, and the dialogue is snappy (\"I thought you were smarter than the rest, Walter. But I was wrong. You're not smarter, just a little taller\"), filled with lots of \"dame\"s and \"baby\"s. Stanwyck is the ultimate femme fatale, and MacMurray, despite a career largely defined by roles as a softy (notably in the TV seriesMy Three Sonsand the movieThe Shaggy Dog), is convincingly cast against type as the hapless, love-struck sap.--Jenny Brown", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300215644", "0783236352", "6304039530", "6303402070", "6301975987", "6302226899", "6301973410", "6300215512", "6300183580", "6300183513", "6304457316", "B001D8W7EK", "6301640667", "6304359705", "6302909023", "6305999872", "B000003KE0", "0783221347", "6304429274", "0792837096", "6301797906", "630197350X", "0769403468", "B00AEFXN9G", "6301797957", "B00023P4FQ", "6304039506", "0790743213", "B001D8W7F4", "6305123616", "0783217390", "6302360978", "6302041090", "0800100832", "B000EVD38G", "6301773586", "0792839846", "B001D8W7EU", "B00008LDNZ", "6304119046", "6301798503", "0782008348", "630196697X", "6301969316", "6305012792", "0783235674", "B000AV4RQ2", "0792841409", "6301966430", "6300181421", "6301973232", "6301973259", "6302413400", "0792110269", "6303057225", "6302413435", "B001BZQMFA", "0800113055", "6300181405", "B000GX7MMA", "B000M7BEPQ", "6304111363", "6302227135", "6303396623", "6304039522", "1569942072", "B0045HCJ9E", "6302484383", "6302238331", "6300215741", "6301978536", "B00004TYS8", "6302700949", "0783217528", "0783235607", "6301586042", "6301976061", "B0047M6Y66", "0792841026", "6301800974", "6301798708", "0792837967", "6301798732", "6300181367", "B00005Q4GZ", "630266232X", "B0000040EO", "0790734079", "6302725542", "6300269310", "0783235682", "6301963911", "6301798562", "6301969049", "0792108280", "6300251012", "6302801133", "1558804226", "0792101448", "0764007440"], "bought_together": ["0783236352"], "also_viewed": ["B00I3C1T1Q", "6301797906", "6304429274", "6305123616", "B000005PPB", "B0050FXDDQ", "0800116917", "6301976983", "6304117752", "0783216084", "6303402070", "0792837096", "6304039522", "6301964012", "0792839846", "B009YX8MSG", "B00GST8UB8", "B00JAQJMJ0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 171937}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 24.0, "brand": "", "asin": "1558807780", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5164XM9AE3L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Double Indemnity [VHS]"}
{"description": "Judge Dreddis one of those movies that doesn't have a brain of its own, so it can only rip off a lot of ingredients from other, better movies. It's a mishmash ofBlade Runner,Total Recall, andThe Road Warrior, with a dash ofStar Warstossed in for good measure. As if that weren't enough, it's got Sylvester Stallone, who seems to be the only one in the movie who's in on the game and knows it's all a sci-fi scam. LikeThe Fifth Elementa few years later,Judge Dredddepicts a futuristic megalopolis packed with crowded vertical overgrowth and rampant commerce, where anarchy reigns supreme. Violent \"block wars\" are fought by lawless citizens with machine guns, and Judge Dredd (Stallone) is one of the city's heavily armed policemen, given free rein to judge and execute the perpetrators of violence. But Dredd himself is subjected to judgment and swift justice when his own gun is identified in the murder of a prominent TV reporter, forcing him to do whatever he can to clear his name. Diane Lane plays his partner in crime-fighting and romance, and Rob Schneider provides juvenile comic relief as Dredd's streetwise sidekick. Impressive special effects are on vivid display, and the movie's fun for what it's worth. Lower your expectations and you just might enjoy it.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0045HCJGC", "B009YQJ322", "B0045HCJG2", "B0045HCJ5S", "B00070FX5U", "B00004STDN", "B000U1ZV62", "B004SIP6WW", "B000MEYKEG", "B0045HCJT4", "B00003CXTM", "0783226934", "B00315462E", "B000056PNL", "6304779631", "B0000VV5BM", "B000056PMU", "B002GHHHME", "B00HZMZ2FE", "B0002S94CK", "B0004Z33G4", "6304602944", "B00IZZDWKM", "B005LAII3A", "B00005JA8B", "B001B3LIOC", "B00005N7Z1", "B000U1ZV8K", "B00AKGG828", "B0068FZ0O2", "B0001Z37HM", "6305767866", "B0006IIPL2", "0780622650", "B000QUCRB4", "B009MF5BXK", "B00004Y87O", "B00007AJG4", "B00H1RMWYW", "B003YOZNBU", "B002ZG999U", "B0004Z33F0", "B00BTYMPUY", "B000R348QW", "6304806434", "B003KV3E2M", "B0015XHP2C", "078401132X", "B0006GANOQ", "0767802454", "B00D3LA6RK", "B000BPL2FQ", "B00D3LA7G0", "B000022TSJ", "B00005JM5B", "B0045HCJFS", "B002AS466O", "B00BLF9FOK", "B000RW3VCK", "6304712499", "B00005JKIP", "B0004Z33EQ", "B00005N5S5", "6304711891", "B00026ZG10", "B00AEFYDM2", "B002OGMGV4", "B00IKM5LXG", "B001VLBDD0", "B001QB9H1U", "B001KRVLCI", "B005LAII8A", "B00003CXWS", "0767807588", "B00AEFY6PQ", "B0001FGBWK", "B002ZG98LO", "B008JFURII", "B0013LL2Z2", "B001M9ELQC", "B001FB55HQ", "B000CEXGAU", "B0015FQZIK", "B000QXDCLU", "B00JL6L4UY", "B001L2ZSJO", "B000BMY2N8", "B000U1ZV4Y", "B002GHHHP6", "B000FOPPBK", "B002GOAH1A", "B002UZCJ8Y", "B001T21R5U", "B008JFUN50", "B008JFUO36", "B000RETOH4", "1558908315", "B00003CXIV", "0783225547", "B008JFUQZ2"], "bought_together": ["B009YQJ322"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B009YQJ322", "B0045HCJGC", "B00005JA8B", "B0045HCJG2"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 14955}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.99, "brand": "Buena Vista", "asin": "1558908846", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51NYJDV9HTL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Judge Dredd"}

{"description": "Robert Bresson drew inspiration from Dostoevsky'sCrime and Punishmentfor this examination of an arrogant young pickpocket who deems himself above the laws and conditions of ordinary men. Michel (Martin LaSalle), a rather bland-looking young man with a perpetually blank face, haunts the subways, city streets, and racetracks to ply his trade. He plays a game of wits with a fatherly police inspector and walls his heart off from the affections of a quiet young woman, Jeanne (Marika Green), who looks after his dying mother. Bresson's direction of his \"models\" (as he calls his nonprofessional performers) strips them of affectation and motivation, making them blank slates defined by the accumulation of precisely drilled actions and words.Pickpocketis no thriller, though Bresson offers impressive, meticulously detailed scenes of daring and intimate robberies (one sequence on a subway feels like an homage to Sam Fuller'sPickup on South Street). Rather, it is a powerful, profound search for meaning and spiritual enlightenment by a man who believes in nothing but himself, and many critics consider it Bresson's masterpiece. Paul Schrader, whose bookTranscendental Cinemaoffers a detailed analysis of Bresson's work, has quoted the famous, emotionally restrained yet spiritually moving conclusion in two of his own films:American GigoloandLight Sleeper.--Sean Axmaker", "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 597369}, "asin": "1567301290", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21WTVB3RD3L.jpg", "title": "Pickpocket [VHS]"}

{"description": "When Universal Pictures picked up the movie rights to a Broadway adaptation ofDracula, they felt secure in handing the property over to the sinister team of actor Lon Chaney and director Tod Browning. But Chaney died of cancer, and Universal hired the Hungarian who had scored a success in the stage play: B&eacute;la Lugosi. The resulting film launched both Lugosi's baroque career and the horror-movie cycle of the 1930s. It gets off to an atmospheric start, as we meet Count Dracula in his shadowy castle in Transylvania, superbly captured by the great cinematographer Karl Freund. Eventually Dracula and his blood-sucking devotee (Dwight Frye, in one of the cinema's truly mad performances) meet their match in a vampire-hunter called Van Helsing (Edward Van Sloan). If the later sections of the film are undeniably stage bound and a tad creaky, Dracula nevertheless casts a spell, thanks to Lugosi's creepily lugubrious manner and the eerie silences of Browning's directing style. (After a mood-enhancing snippet ofSwan Lakeunder the opening titles, there is no music in the film.)Frankenstein, which was released a few months later, confirmed the horror craze, and Universal has been making money (and countless spin-off projects) from its twin titans of terror ever since. Certainly the role left a lasting impression on the increasingly addled and drug-addicted Lugosi, who was never quite able to distance himself from the part that made him a star. He was buried, at his request, in his black vampire cape.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300183084", "6300181286", "6300183092", "6300183629", "6302120101", "630252542X", "6302843219", "6300185443", "6302526167", "6301005783", "6301257014", "6302841771", "6302526175", "6303257801", "6302841763", "6302843227", "6300185281", "6300181820", "630284178X", "0783235607", "6302526191", "6302526140", "6302841844", "6300181340", "6301967410", "0783222955", "6302526086", "630018529X", "6304507348", "6302526051", "B00007JME0", "0783240961", "B00AEBB8VK", "630252587X", "6302526094", "6300247589", "B002VWNIAY", "6303626424", "6302843200", "6305576173", "630266232X", "6301327845", "6300215539", "6303402070", "6300182983", "6302309751", "5554306004", "6302841798", "0790705141", "630214227X", "630281474X"], "bought_together": ["6300181286", "6300183092"], "also_viewed": ["6300181286", "6300183629", "6300183092", "6300183084", "6302526175", "6300185281", "6302843219", "630252542X", "6302526140", "6302120101", "B00L8QP0VY", "6302843197", "630018529X", "6302526086", "6302841763", "630252587X", "6302841771", "6302526167", "6300185443", "B00000JMOF", "B00000K14A", "630312917X", "6302843200", "6300214087", "B0001HAGTM", "B008FL8OTK", "B000WNHTCC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 228201}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6300181278", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51588FFRK0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Dracula [VHS]"}

{"description": "In 1941, Barbara Stanwyck was offered two screwball roles equally suited to her tart intelligence, deft comic timing, and undeniable sex appeal, and it's a photo finish as to which was funnier--showgirl-on-the-lam Sugarpuss O'Shea, the title character in Howard Hawks'sBall of Fire, or con artist Jean Harrington a.k.a. Lady Eve Sidwich, the delirious fulcrum for this classic Preston Sturges comedy. Under Sturges's typically antic microscope, the collision between the gold-digging Harrington and the very rich, very hapless brewery-heir-turned-herpetologist Charles Pike (a wonderfully callow, guileless Henry Fonda) yields ample opportunity for the writer-director to skewer issues of class and sex; as always, Sturges is bold in pushing the censors' envelope, capturing a palpable erotic heat between the canny Jean and the literally feverish Charlie, who, after a year up the Amazon, is instantly smitten by the mere sight of her shapely ankles (in hindsight, a precursor to her subsequent effect inDouble Indemnity). To give away the plot machinations driving the farce would spoil the fun, beyond confirming impersonations, mixed signals, and misunderstandings as the turns in a consistently rollicking ride that makes good use of Charles Coburn and screwball character veterans Eugene Pallette, William Demarest, and Eric Blore.--Sam Sutherland", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEBB9EG", "0792844564", "6303391931", "630365164X", "6303383009", "B00156HZM4", "B006P0UQ2G", "6301972171", "B000021Y6M", "6303364772", "6302224365", "6301965760", "6303393985", "6301977181", "6301805615", "6301969081", "1558807780", "6300185206", "6301232291", "0783228074", "6300209741", "630266232X", "6301976282", "6303631851", "6301978390"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 314886}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.88, "brand": "", "asin": "6300185125", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GXV4Y7KJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Lady Eve [VHS]"}

{"description": "Francis Ford Coppola took some of the deep background from the life of Mafia chief Vito Corleone--the patriarch of Mario Puzo's bestselling novelThe Godfather--and built around it a stunning sequel to his Oscar-winning, 1972 hit film. Robert De Niro plays Vito as a young Sicilian immigrant in turn-of-the-century New York City's Little Italy. Coppola weaves in and out of the story of Vito's transformation into a powerful crime figure, contrasting that evolution against efforts by son Michael Corleone to spread the family's business into pre-Castro Cuba. As memorable as the first film is,The Godfather IIis an amazingly intricate, symmetrical tragedy that touches upon several chapters of 20th-century history and makes a strong case that our destinies are written long before we're born. This was De Niro's first introduction to a lot of filmgoers, and he makes an enormous impression. But even with him and a number of truly brilliant actors (including maestro Lee Strasberg), this is ultimately Pacino's film and a masterful performance.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000003KHS", "6302158176", "6300183211", "B0019L21H4", "6300214826", "6303686796", "6303168507", "0782008348", "6303471501", "0790705141", "0790733927", "6303402070", "B00003CXE6", "B000056BRF", "6300267997", "6300181340", "B0001VL30O", "6301977815", "6305363668", "0800132009", "6304508611", "B00005B238", "6300182878", "0792845684", "6302226899", "B00005Q4GZ", "0800100832", "6304429274", "B0000A36J1"], "bought_together": ["B000003KHS", "6302158176"], "also_viewed": ["B000NTPDSW", "B0019L770A", "B000003KHS", "6302158176", "6302610702", "6300183211", "0792174909", "B00EN09FKO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 228315}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.9, "brand": "Paramount", "asin": "630021639X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41807N7YNFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Godfather, Part II [VHS]"}
{"description": "Back when the  firstStar Trekfeature was released in December 1979, theTrekfranchise was still relatively modest, consisting of the original TV series, an animated cartoon series from 1973-74, and a burgeoning fan network around the world. Series creator Gene Roddenberry had conceived a second TV series, but after the success ofStar Warsthe project was upgraded into this lavish feature film, which reunited the original series cast aboard a beautifully redesigned starship U.S.S.Enterprise. Under the direction of Robert Wise (best known forWest Side Story), the film proved to be a mixed blessing forTrekfans, who heatedly debated its merits; but it was, of course, a phenomenal hit. Capt. Kirk (William Shatner) leads his crew into the vast structures surrounding V'Ger, an all-powerful being that is cutting a destructive course through Starfleet space. With his new First Officer (Stephen Collins), the bald and beautiful Lieutenant Ilia (played by the late Persis Khambatta) and his returning veteran crew, Kirk must decipher the secret of V'Ger's true purpose and restore the safety of the galaxy. The story is rather overblown and derivative of plots from the original series, and avid Trekkies greeted the film's bland costumes with derisive laughter. But as a feast for the eyes, this is an adventure worthy of big-screen trekkin'. Douglas Trumbull's visual effects are astonishing, and Jerry Goldmith's score is regarded as one of the prolific composer's very best (with its main theme later used forStar Trek: The Next Generation). And, fortunately forStar Trekfans, the expanded 143-minute version (originally shown for the film's network TV premiere) is generally considered an improvement over the original theatrical release.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300214400", "6300213803", "6301543408", "6303202004", "630021463X", "6303909949", "B0000AUHOH", "B00008OSD3", "6301792734", "6305587159", "6300182304", "B0000A36J1", "B000065U6Q", "6304415346", "6305365121", "630336568X", "0671830880", "6300214060", "6304935811", "6302380588", "6303651488"], "bought_together": ["6300213803", "6300214400"], "also_viewed": ["6300213803", "6301543408", "B00DB97LRC", "6300214400", "630021463X", "B00BAXTYIA", "B00005JLRT", "6303202004", "B00DB97LCM", "B00000ILBK", "B002I9Z8DK", "B0000AUHOH", "B002I9Z8B2", "6304415346", "6304539258", "B000USUA8Y", "B002I9Z8CG", "B0095XPZBC", "B002I9Z8GW", "B001TH16DI", "B0083TUEHY", "B00HETWFVC", "630273486X", "B000HEWEJ4", "6303909949", "6300213668"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 278050}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.79, "brand": "", "asin": "6300216802", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4164CYFHC6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Star Trek - The Motion Picture [VHS]"}

While not as unrelentingly frightening as its blockbuster predecessor, this more-than-competent sequel toThe Omenraises some interesting questions about the nature of free will (can the antichrist deny his birthright?) before falling into a gory series of increasingly outlandish deaths, the best of which is a terrifyingly protracted scene beneath the ice of a frozen lake.

{"description": "AfterThe Exorcistsparked a lengthy trend of supernatural thrillers, this 1976 horror film scored a hit with critics and audiences for mixing gothic horror and mystery into its plot about a young boy suspected of being the personification of the anti-Christ. (No doubt it's a favorite of shock-rocker  Marilyn Manson.) Directed by Richard Donner (best known for hisSupermanandLethal Weaponfilms),The Omengained a lot of credibility from the casting of Gregory Peck and Lee Remick as a distinguished American couple living in England, whose young son Damien bears \"the mark of the beast.\" Mysterious deaths and unexplained incidents draw the attention of a photographer (David Warner), whose investigation leads to the young boy--and also to the photographer's shocking decapitation (in a scene that has since been inducted into the horror hall of fame). At a time when graphic gore had yet to dominate the horror genre, this film used its violence discreetly and to great effect, and the mood of dread and potential death is masterfully maintained. It's all a bit hokey, with a lot of biblical portent and sensational fury, but few would deny it's highly entertaining.

The film's clever narrative structure first presents us with the imposingly rotund General Clive Wynne-Candy (Roger Livesey in his greatest screen performance), a blustering old duffer who seems the epitome of stuffy, outmoded values. But traveling backwards 40 years we see a different man altogether: the young and dashing officer \"Sugar\" Candy. Through a series of affecting relationships with three women (all played to perfection by Deborah Kerr) and his touching lifelong friendship with a German officer (Anton Wallbrook), we see Candy's life unfold and come to understand how difficult it is for him to adapt his sense of military honor to modern notions of \"total war.\" Notoriously, this is the film that Winston Churchill tried to have banned, and indeed its sympathetic portrayal of a German officer was contentious in 1943, though one suspects that Churchill's own blimpishness was a factor too.--Mark Walker", "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 492525}, "asin": "6300256073", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21KD0SDT21L.jpg", "title": "The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp [VHS]"}

If anything, the reputation of this legendary 1956 romp about a child bride in the Deep South has shifted the other way; the ripe image of Carol Baker as a mentally challenged nymphet who sucks her thumb as she lures grown men into her crib (an actual crib!) would probably be hounded off the screen today. When it was originally released the film won a \"condemned\" rating from the Catholic Legion of Decency, but it isn't as explicit as that might suggest.

{"description": "Tin Men, the second in Barry Levinson's ongoing film series about his native Baltimore in the 1950s and '60s, focuses on a pair of competing aluminum-siding salesman at a point when the industry was loaded with scam artists. Richard Dreyfuss and Danny DeVito play rivals who get involved in a fender-bender that quickly escalates from a minor argument into an all-out war, as they begin pulling practical jokes on each other. Dreyfuss takes it too far, however, when he sets out to seduce DeVito's unhappy wife (Barbara Hershey) and winds up falling in love with her. Much of the humor here comes from Levinson's keen ear as writer and director for the way these people talk--and what they talk about (like the discussion of why four men are living together without women on the Ponderosa inBonanza). Beside the leads, the cast includes a great host of character actors, including Jackie Gayle, Bruno Kirby, John Mahoney, and J.T. Walsh.

Rock Hudson (as wonderfully wooden as ever) and Lauren Bacall play stalwart examples of altruism, clean living, and good old American ambition, but Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone steal the film as white trash millionaire siblings stewing in self-pity. The plot reads like an episode ofDallas: Texas oil-baron playboy Stack steals good girl Bacall from best friend Hudson while Stack's sister Malone puts her slinky moves on Hudson, the strapping poor boy made good. Toss in impotence, jealousy, alcoholic binges, emotional blackmail, and backstabbing nastiness, mix vigorously with high style and expressionist flourishes, and you've got the most potent melodrama cocktail of the 1950s. Stack twists his arch delivery into the practiced bravado of a boozing womanizer nursing an inferiority complex while Malone sashays and flirts her way through an Oscar-winning performance as a slutty, sassy good-time girl. It's so over the top that it might seem kitschy at first glance, but former theater director Sirk subtly shades his vision in the shadows of film noir and uses the portentous angles and gaudy color to create a vivid, vivacious world of glossy surfaces and social masks cracking under the pressure of responsibility and the pain of lost love.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783215096", "6300183890", "B006VRRGOO", "B000HA4WSO", "B0009ML2KQ", "B000ION7AI", "6304239149", "6301706587", "6303364772", "1572520922", "6301973410", "6301975987", "6301977084", "6300215741", "6300269795", "6301973313", "6302278929", "6302000661", "630197333X", "630150528X", "0800100832", "B000BWIZRW", "B002TOL49Q", "630310245X"], "bought_together": ["0783215096", "6300183890"], "also_viewed": ["B00514JKKG", "B001ILTUL0", "B000JJRBFY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 291274}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.59, "brand": "", "asin": "6301045750", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515JMNXTQML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Written on the Wind [VHS]"}

{"description": "This adaptation of the F. Scott Fitzgerald novel, scripted by Francis Ford Coppola, puts costume design and art direction above the intricacies of character. It's certainly a handsome try, and perhaps no movie could captureThe Great Gatsbyin its entirety. Robert Redford is an interesting casting choice as Gatsby, the millionaire isolated in his mansion, still dreaming of the woman he lost. And Sam Waterston is perfect as the narrator, Nick, who brings the dream girl Daisy Buchanan back to Gatsby. No, the problem seems to be that director Jack Clayton fell in love with the flapper dresses and the party scenes and the Jazz Age tunes, ending up with a Classics Illustrated version of a great book rather than a fresh, organic take on the text. While Redford grows more quietly intriguing in the film, Mia Farrow's pallid performance as Daisy leaves you wondering why Gatsby, or anyone else, should care so much about his grand passion. The effective supporting cast includes Bruce Dern as Daisy's husband, and Scott Wilson and Karen Black as the low-rent couple whose destinies cross the sun-drenched protagonists.

{"description": "Part mystery, part wartime polemic,Lifeboatfinds director Alfred Hitchcock tackling a cinematic challenge that foreshadows the self-imposed handicaps ofRopeandRear Window. As with those subsequent features, Hitchcock confines his action and characters to a single set, in this instance the lone surviving lifeboat from an Allied freighter sunk by a German U-boat in the North Atlantic. A less confident, ingenious filmmaker might have opened up John Steinbeck's dialogue-driven character study beyond the battered boat and its cargo of survivors, but Hitchcock instead revels in his predicament to exploit the enforced intimacy between his characters.Indeed, we never actually see the doomed freighter--the smoking ship's funnel beneath the credits simply sinks beneath the waves, and we're plunged into the escalating tensions between those who gradually find their way to the boat, a band of eight English and American passengers and crew, plus a German sailor (Walter Slezak) rescued from the U-boat, itself destroyed by the freighter's deck gun. Heading the cast and inevitably commanding their and our attention is the cello-voiced Tallulah Bankhead as Connie Porter, a cynical, sophisticated writer whose priorities seem to be hanging onto her mink and keeping her lipstick fresh. Gradually, the others find Porter and her lifeboat, forming a temporary community that inevitably suggests a careful cross section of archetypes, from wealthy industrialist (Henry Hull) to ship's boiler men (John Hodiak and William Bendix).Hitchcock juggles the interpersonal skirmishes between the boat's occupants with the mystery of their German prisoner, which itself becomes a meditation on the fine line between nationalism and morality, a line that Slezak walks delicately until his identity is resolved. Visually, Hitchcock transforms his back-lot set and its rear-projected cloudbanks into a desolate stretch of ocean, while capturing the horror of an amputation through an economical set of images culminating in an empty boot.--Sam Sutherland", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0045HCJ9E", "6302413435", "0783236352", "B002GSXKQA", "0790743159", "1558807780", "6301800974", "0783235623", "0769403468", "6301640667", "6301975987", "6301973232", "1558808590", "630150528X", "0800100832", "6301564456", "6302226899", "6301959728", "B000EVD38G", "B00004R67T", "6302909023", "B00005Q4GY", "6304457316", "0790743213", "6300246965", "6301798503", "6302360978", "0783221347", "6301797957", "6301973410", "6300183580", "6304196954", "6301798708", "B000056BRF", "6302842263", "6304359705", "0792108280", "079074886X"], "also_viewed": ["B001D8W7F4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 319371}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6301798732", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51AC1NXHYzL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Lifeboat (The Hitchcock Collection) [VHS]"}

{"description": "Glenn Savan's depressing and self-loathing novel about a 27-year-old upper-class Jewish widower mired in self-pity after his beloved wife dies, and who finds love and sexual rebirth with a trailer-trash older woman, was brought to the big screen by the competent director Luis Mandoki (When a Man Loves a Woman,Message in a Bottle). But the savage irony in Savan's book has been face-lifted by screenwriters Ted Tally (The Silence of the Lambs) and Alvin Sargent (Ordinary People) into something else entirely: what passes for low-rent \"slumming\" in Hollywood means hiring sexy Susan Sarandon to play Nora Baker, the poor, uneducated 43-year-old waitress in a White Palace burger joint who strikes up an unlikely relationship with sad Max Baron (James Spader). Widower Max attends a bachelor party for best pal Neil (Jason Alexander) and discovers that the local White Palace has stiffed the boys a whopping six burgers. Max barges into the joint, bent on getting his money back, and meets a testy Nora, who is bemused at the young man's insolence. While driving home, Max stops abruptly at a bar for a drink. Inside, Nora is nursing a vodka and takes a shine to the tuxedo-clad, handsome, and morose younger man. He gives her a lift, she seduces him, and the rest of the movie examines how two such opposites in manners and morals can find happiness. The only common bond they have is great sex and a private tragedy.White Palacenudges at the dark journey and the smashing of illusion that was at the heart of the novel, but there is still a fairy-tale element to the film that negates the earthy essence that distinguished the book. In Mandoki's vision,White Palaceis about overcoming class, family, and outside opinion to find true love. In Savan's book, Max wastes into decline while Nora ultimately thrives in the quest for truth, redemption, and self-forgiveness. She becomes his salvation only after he stops hating himself. But mainstream Hollywood shuns making \"protagonists\" so mad, bad, or sad, and as such, too much glitter is tossed on Spader, while Sarandon, as usual, is the only one who seems to embody and understand her character's angst.

{"description": "This 1966 masterpiece by Michelangelo Antonioni (ThePassenger) is set in the heady atmosphere of Swinging London, and stars David Hemmings as an unsmiling fashion photographer hooked on ephemeral meaning attached to anything: art, sex, work, relationships, drugs, events. When a real mystery falls into his lap, he probes the evidence for some reliable truth, but finds it hard to reckon with. Vanessa Redgrave plays an enigmatic woman whose desperation to cover something up only seems like one more phenomenon in Hemmings's disinterested purview.

{"description": "It's hard to overstate just how corny and funny the Andy Hardy series of the 1930s and 1940s looks by today's standards--but that doesn't mean these films don't have a certain winning quality. It doesn't matter whether it's Mickey Rooney's winningly goofy blend of lust and innocence as a high school kid dying to make out with his girlfriend or his surprisingly touching man-to-man talks with his father, Judge Hardy (Lewis Stone). Think of this film as the precursor to \"Archie\" comic books, with its story of young Andy, desperate for the money to buy a car, winding up with three dates to the same formal dance. Rooney is engaging as the motor-mouthed (yet deceptively thoughtful) teen in pre-World War II, tail-end-of-the-Depression, small-town America: often in a coat and tie, always in a dandyish porkpie hat.

{"description": "Dickens, with his vast humanity and that amazing vitality of his which created a whole world of characters, contains inexhaustable riches for the screen, though his long rambling plots are the despair of scenerio writers. His people--types, caricatures, or whatever you choose to call them--are distict and individual in appearance, actions and speech--and are rare parts for good actors. The trick in getting Dickens effectively on the screen was an enormously difficult one of selecting and condensing--keeping enough to satisfy the Dickens lover who complains bitterly when any favourite character or episode is left out. Some may find Dickens as being overlong, overly sentimental and often more than a bit tedious; at any rate, however, this is excellent Dickens! Good intentions and imposing ambitions are plentiful enough in the making of movies, but woefully rare are the instances where technical excellence, good taste and judgement and an intelligent sense of the rightness of things combined to bring thowe intentions and ambitions to a successful issue. DAVID COPPERFIELD is one of those rare and happy successes. It met every reasonable expectation competently and generously, and the film was highly praised by the critics and public alike back in 1935. This filmed version of the classic novel by Dickens, is remarkably faithful to the source - rich in atmosphere and fine characterisations. David himself is played ideally by both Freddie Bartholomew and Frank Lawton; they miraculously seem to be the same person at different ages! If Frank Lawton seems less interesting, its only because his adventures are so mild compared with those of Bartholomew. W.C. Fields' whole career seemed to have been a preparation for his role as Micawber; he is magnificent in his off-beat role", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300988805", "B000MGBLI2", "B000GRUQL0", "B000BYA4II", "B0002C7ZAE", "6303364705", "6301670140"], "bought_together": ["6300988805"], "also_viewed": ["B000GRUQLK"]}, "price": 9.38, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 350084}, "asin": "6301967801", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21PGCRWW26L.jpg", "title": "David Copperfield [VHS]"}

{"description": "A hallmark of the science fiction genre as well as a wry commentary on the political climate of the 1950s,The Day the Earth Stood Stillis a sci-fi movie less concerned with special effects than with a social parable. A spacecraft lands in Washington, D.C., carrying a humanoid messenger from another world (Michael Rennie) imparting a warning to the people of Earth to cease their violent behavior. But panic ensues as the messenger lands and is shot by a nervous soldier. His large robot companion destroys the Capitol as the messenger escapes the confines of the hospital. He moves in with a family as a boarder and blends into society to observe the full range of the human experience. Director Robert Wise (West Side Story) not only provides one of the most recognizable icons of the science fiction world in his depiction of the massive robot loyal to his master, but he avoids the obvious camp elements of the story to create a quiet and observant story highlighting both the good and the bad in human nature.--Robert Lane", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000HDNPM0", "6300215539", "6301327845", "6304507348", "6301977815", "6300208508", "6300181278", "0800132009", "6302120101", "6302797667", "6300181340", "6304233639", "6300183513", "0790743213", "6300181286", "6300183580", "6300269566", "6300183084", "0783235593", "0783221347", "6302884705", "0783235607", "6302763835", "0783236352", "630442972X", "6300215644", "0800116917", "0790752395", "0790743159", "6300182533", "630266232X", "6300269477", "6302605164", "6300185974", "B00005B238", "0782008348"], "bought_together": ["6300215539"], "also_viewed": ["6300208508"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 312863}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.34, "brand": "", "asin": "6302168465", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51QGHTN64FL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Day the Earth Stood Still [VHS]"}

Patrick Swayze plays Bodhi, zen-master leader of the surfing clan,  humming serenely with the wisdom of the waves. (Alarmingly, Swayze also did his  own skydiving stunts.)

Connery returned inDiamonds Are Foreverbefore leaving the role to Roger Moore and Lazenby's subsequent career fizzled, yet this one-hit wonder is responsible for one of the best Bond films of all time.InOn Her Majesty's Secret Service, 007 leaves the Service to privately  pursue his SPECTRE nemesis Blofeld (played this time by Telly Savalas), whose latest master plan involves a threat to the world's crops by agricultural sterilization. Bond teams up with suave international crime lord Draco (Gabriele Ferzetti) and falls in love with--and marries--his elegant daughter, Tracy (Diana Rigg). Bond goes monogamous? Not at first; after all he has Blofeld's harem to seduce.

{"description": "This black-and-white film adaptation of Tennessee Williams's Southern gothic play is perhaps more famous for the rumored off-screen shenanigans of its stars than for its over-the-top repressed sexuality (only Williams could pull off that paradox, and pull it off he does). Supposedly, stars Katharine Hepburn and Elizabeth Taylor battled for screen time; Hepburn warred very publicly with director Joseph Mankiewicz; and a postaccident Montgomery Clift relied heavily on painkillers and support from friend Taylor during the grueling shoot. Even this, however, cannot top the events of the film itself, revolving around the unseen playboy Sebastian and his mysterious death, which has something to do with young boys, a decadent European vacation, and Taylor in a provocative wet, white bathing suit. To give away the plot would spoil the fun, but suffice it to say that what Taylor saw was so horrible it drove her nuts, and Sebastian's mother (Hepburn) wants her to have a lobotomy in order to keep it from coming out; Clift is brought in to do the procedure. It's all a hoot and a holler, but as played by the two leading ladies (both of whom nabbed Oscar nominations), it's also compelling, chilling, and utterly gothic. Taylor gives a fierce performance, as the climaxing monologue that reveals Sebastian's \"secret\" rests entirely on her shoulders, and Hepburn plays brilliantly against type as Sebastian's manipulating, overbearing mother. Only Clift, saddled with a dreary character in charge of plot exposition, fails to deliver.

{"description": "This silky smooth film noir pits gruff police detective Dana Andrews, stiff and blunt in his street-bred manners, against a cultured columnist and acidic wit (Clifton Webb at his prissiest) in a battle of wits during a murder investigation. The cop is a romantic hiding under a hard-boiled exterior who falls in love with the beautiful victim through the portrait that hangs in her apartment. Gene Tierney, whose heart-shaped face mixes the exotic with the girl next door, brings the poise and calm of a model to her role as the object of every man's gaze and the target of a killer.Laura, handsomely shot in dreamy black and white, is the first and best of Otto Preminger's cool, controlled murder mysteries. In the gritty world of film noir it remains the most refined and elegant example of the genre, but under the tasteful decor and high-society fashions lies a world seething in jealousy, passion, blackmail, and murder. Vincent Price costars as a blithe gigolo and David Raksin's lush theme has become a wistful romantic standard.--Sean Axmaker", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 231608}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "title": "Laura [VHS]", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303364772", "6301973410", "6301586042", "6302732964", "B0000040EO", "6301969316", "6302413435", "6304056915", "6301670140", "6300183890", "6300183513", "B0000068EE", "B00003OSTO", "6301797957", "6301798503", "6300215741", "0792840836", "B0000048YO", "6301976932", "6300215644", "6301586050", "6304039530", "6302226899", "B000E6ESWG", "0782006779", "6301670159", "6302413451", "0790743531", "B001ARDBXU", "0783215096", "6301586026", "6301964012", "6301971647", "6300183912", "6302800897", "630197879X", "0792107683", "6302224411", "6303120504", "B00004TX24", "6301967070", "B000BWIZRW", "6300181111", "1558807780", "6304056869", "B006P0UQ2G", "6302842263", "6300251152", "6302806348", "079284517X", "0800113055", "6303560067", "6300216721", "6301978536", "0792840844", "6301973380", "0783236352", "6302363292", "6301978315", "6304119097", "6301978706", "6304383169", "B000021Y6M", "6303957013", "6300181278", "6302305950", "B00000JKNL", "0800100832", "0783221347", "6301797906", "078200847X", "0783217390", "6302278929", "6302120535", "6302450179", "6303333079", "6301973089", "6301975987", "6305012792", "B00000F3UB", "6301967682", "0790743213", "6301798759", "6301661826", "6301628454", "630196912X", "B000006N70", "1558804226", "B000021Y6K", "6300208133", "6301965620", "6302787033", "6301578805", "6301491920", "0792837649", "6304359705", "6301969081", "6303364748", "6302360978", "6302309751"], "also_viewed": ["B000083C6R", "B002GSXKQA", "B0086IMNRQ", "6300207919", "6301969316", "B002VWNIAY", "6300183513", "0792839846"]}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GSB8Q42DL._SY300_.jpg", "asin": "630266232X"}

{"description": "Director Gillo Pontecorvo's 1966 movieThe Battle of Algiersconcerns the violent struggle in the late 1950s for Algerian independence from France, where the film was banned on its release for fear of creating civil disturbances. Certainly, the heady, insurrectionary mood of the film, enhanced by a relentlessly pulsating Ennio Morricone soundtrack, makes for an emotionally high temperature throughout. Decades later, the advent of the \"war against terror\" has only intensified the film's relevance.Shot in a gripping, quasi-documentary style,The Battle of Algiersuses a cast of untrained actors coupled with a stern voiceover. Initially, the film focuses on the conversion of young hoodlum Ali La Pointe (Brahim Haggiag) to F.L.N. (the Algerian Liberation Front). However, as a sequence of outrages and violent counter-terrorist measures ensue, it becomes clear that, as in Eisenstein'sOctober, it is the Revolution itself that is the true star of the film.Pontecorvo balances cinematic tension with grimly acute political insight. He also manages an evenhandedness in depicting the adversaries. He doesn't flinch from demonstrating the civilian consequences of the F.L.N.'s bombings, while Colonel Mathieu, the French office brought in to quell the nationalists, is played by Jean Martin as a determined, shrewd, and, in his own way, honorable man. However, the closing scenes of the movie--a welter of smoke, teeming street demonstrations, and the pealing white noise of ululations--leaves the viewer both intellectually and emotionally convinced of the rightfulness of the liberation struggle. This is surely among a handful of the finest movies ever made.--David Stubbs", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 371273}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 18.88, "brand": "", "asin": "6302737249", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/211ZN60665L.jpg", "title": "Battle of Algiers [VHS]"}

Or at least it starts brightly enough--the anarchic humor soon settles into mirthful memories and a sense of melancholy as the ghosts of Christmas past, present, and future take Scrooge on a journey of his lonely, wasted life. Michael Caine makes a wonderful Scrooge, delightfully rediscovering the meaning of life as fantastic creations from Henson's Creature Shop (developed specially for this film) take the reins as the three ghosts.

With her father's employer trying to take her on as a mistress and her roommate's husband taking her on as an easy lover, Redgrave's Georgy navigates the narrows between prostitution and purity as she tries to hang on to the baby she has grown to love. Worth viewing for the seamless performances and the complex understanding of ethical interaction.--James DiGiovanna", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 419161}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.79, "brand": "", "asin": "6302806356", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/7146GEY2FFL._SY300_.gif", "title": "Georgy Girl [VHS]"}
{"description": "This 1987 thriller was a predictable hit with the teen audience it worked overtime to attract. Like most of director Joel Schumacher's films, it's conspicuously designed to push the right marketing and demographic buttons, and granted, there's some pretty cool stuff going on here and there. Take Kiefer Sutherland, for instance. InStand by Mehe played a memorable bully, but here he goes one step further as a memorable bullyvampirewho leads a tribe of teenage vampires on their nocturnal spree of bloodsucking havoc. Jason Patric plays the new guy in town, who quickly attracts a lovely girlfriend (Jami Gertz), only to find that she might be recruiting him into the vampire fold. The movie gets sillier as it goes along, and resorts to a routine action-movie showdown, but it's a visual knockout (featuring great cinematography by Michael Chapman) and boasts a cast that's eminently able (pardon the pun) to sink their teeth into the best parts of an uneven screenplay.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["630018403X", "B00000JPH5", "6300263673", "6300218031", "B00004U8PA", "6300183483", "6301963725", "B00000JGEK", "0784011923", "6300183211", "6300248089", "6302482712", "6300214753", "6304214502", "B000005XXG", "6302256615"], "bought_together": ["630018403X"], "also_viewed": ["6303212379", "0792151712", "6303506291", "6300214710", "B000062XM6", "6301928555"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 209903}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6302814782", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5105MSSAX2L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Lost Boys [VHS]"}

The full title isTim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas, which should give you an idea of the tone of this stop-action animated musical/fantasy/horror/comedy.  It is based on characters created by Burton, the former Disney animator best known as the director ofPee-wee's Big Adventure,Beetlejuice,Edward Scissorhands, and the first twoBatmanmovies. His benignly scary-funny sensibility dominates the story of Halloweentown resident Jack Skellington (voice by Danny Elfman, who also wrote the songs), who stumbles on a bizarre and fascinating alternative universe called ... Christmastown!  Directed by Henry Selick (who later made the delightfulJames and the Giant Peach), this PG-rated picture has a reassuringly light touch.

{"description": "My Neighbor Totorois that rare delight, a family film that appeals to children and adults alike. While their mother is in the hospital, 10-year-old Satsuki and 4-year-old Mei move into an old-fashioned house in the country with their professor father. At the foot of an enormous camphor tree, Mei discovers the nest of King Totoro, a giant forest spirit who resembles an enormous bunny rabbit. Mei and Satsuki learn that Totoro makes the trees grow, and when he flies over the countryside or roars in his thunderous voice, the winds blow. Totoro becomes the protector of the two sisters, watching over them when they wait for their father, and carrying them over the forests on an enchanted journey. When the children worry about their mother, Totoro sends them to visit her via a Catbus, a magical, multilegged creature with a grin the Cheshire Cat might envy.Unlike many cartoon children, Satsuki and Mei are neither smart-alecky nor cloyingly saccharine. They are credible kids: bright, energetic, silly, helpful, and occasionally impatient. Filmmaker Hayao Miyazaki makes the viewer believe the two sisters love each other in a way no American feature has ever achieved.My Neighbor Totorois enormously popular in Japan, and some of the character merchandise has begun to appear in America.

Visiting his sister and brother-in-law in their ultra-progressive household full of noisy gadgets and futuristic decor, Hulot inevitably has dust-ups with modernity, each one exceptionally funny. Taking a page from Buster Keaton's playbook, Tati also employs his trademark techniques with sound and production design to achieve the indefinable, comic genius of his films: the rhythmic clacking of footsteps, the cartoon-panel distance of his camera frame from the heart of the action.

The filmmakers were able to digitally sample what they'd captured of Lee's performance and piece together enough footage to make the movie releasable. Indeed, it is probably more fascinating for that post-production story than for the tale on the screen.The Crowis appropriately cloaked in ominous expressionistic shadows, oozing urban dread and occult menace from every dank concrete crack, but it really adds up to a simple and perfunctory tale of ritual revenge. Guided by a portentous crow (standing in for Poe's raven), Lee plays a deceased rock musician who returns from the grave to systematically torture and kill the outlandishly violent gang of hoodlums who murdered him and his fianc&eacute;e the year before.

{"description": "Richard Donner's 1978 epic about the Man of Steel showed how a film about a superhero could be a moving and romantic experience even for people who long ago gave up comic books. Beginning on the icy planet Krypton, the story follows the baby Kal-El, whose rocket ship lands in Smallville, Kansas.

In 1817 a young foreign drifter (Phoebe Cates, never better) sets a small portion of England buzzing that she is a royal princess from an uncharted land. This feels like a magical movie with slightly overcooked  characters, such as Kevin Kline's Greek butler.

{"description": "Four years before he revived and elevated the Western inStagecoach, director John Ford guided this atmospheric melodrama to multiple Academy Awards, proving that his underlying skills as a storyteller, visual designer, and dramatic guide didn't need epic scale, sweeping action, or favorite star John Wayne to achieve dramatic impact. Based on Liam O'Flaherty's novel set during the Sinn Fein rebellion in 1922, Dudley Nichols's script offers an intimate portrait of Gypo Nolan, a violent, alcoholic Dubliner who betrays a friend (Wallace Ford) for &#163;20, setting in motion a downward spiral of fear, anger, and drunken oblivion.The Impostercaptures Ford and filmmaking at an evolutionary balance point between the purer visual storytelling of silent film and the emerging literary possibilities of sound: on the one hand, Ford paints a nocturnal Dublin of deep shadows and billowing fog in which his characters are placed in pointed tableaux, and project their actions and attitudes with stylized, theatrical gestures that seem naive alongside later, more naturalistic films; on the other, the director pushes his star, Victor McLaglen, past traditional stagecraft toward a truly harrowing, authentic performance. Pauline Kael has noted the Hollywood legend that Ford induced McLaglen's Oscar-winning turn by keeping him too drunk to embellish his work. Whatever the cause, the actor achieves a lumbering, out-of-control power that traces the rage, confusion, and ultimate despair that Nolan's descent describes. That gripping performance is the film's most modern aspect and riveting dramatic hook and more than justifies watching.--Sam Sutherland", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301969316", "6302320496", "6301968972"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 262860}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.03, "brand": "", "asin": "6303360025", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HXZN6N95L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Informer [VHS]"}
{"description": "Cecil B. DeMille's pre-Hays Code Roman costume drama manages to mix fast-and-loose historical facts with melodrama and titillation. Fredric March plays Marcus Superbus, a Roman soldier and womanizer who jeopardizes his position in Nero's storm troopers by developing a crush on a beautiful Christian girl, Mercia (Elissa Landi). With the Christians keeping their faith far underground, Superbus walks a tightrope between his obligations to the state and his love for Mercia until she and her family are rounded up and hauled off to the arena.The Sign of the Crossis not without its problems; by modern standards, it often seems slow and stagy, and its moralistic message comes across as blunt and heavy-handed. DeMille, however, shrewdly knew how to keep an audience's attention in ways that would have been impossible in subsequent years. Consider Claudette Colbert as the alluring, evil Poppaea, lolling in a bath of asses' milk with her breasts almost completely exposed. Or there's the scene where Marcus tries to get Mercia to loosen up a bit; his idea of a fun time is to take her to an orgy where she's groped by a lesbian during an erotic dance. Then there's Charles Laughton as the decadent Nero, his fey manner abetted by an oiled-up boy-toy at his side in nearly every scene. The climactic scenes at the arena are still violent today, with Christians being gnawed by lions, gladiators knocking each other's brains out, and an Amazon spearing a Pygmy and carrying him around like a kebab!The Sign of the Crosswas heavily cut for rerelease in later years but is now available again in its uncut form.--Jerry Renshaw", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303382991"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 395759}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.62, "brand": "", "asin": "6303382967", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51E06X5ME0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Sign of the Cross [VHS]"}
{"description": "This completely absorbing three-hour documentary follows the lives of two inner-city African American teenage basketball prodigies as they move through high school with long-shot dreams of the NBA, superstardom, and an escape from the ghetto. Taking cues from such works as Michael Apted's35 Up, director Steve James and associates shot more than 250 hours of footage, spanning more than six years, and their completed work actually moves like an edge-of-the-seat drama, so brimming with tension, plot twists, successes, and tragedies that its length--170 minutes--is never an issue. Yet, what makes the film more impressive is how James moves his scope beyond a competitive sports drama (although the movie has plenty of terrific, nail-biting basketball footage) and addresses complex social issues, creating a scathing social commentary about class privilege and racial division. The film opens by introducing William Gates and Arthur Agee, two Chicago hopefuls, as they are being courted and recruited by various high schools to play ball, and continues until the pair are college freshmen. James allows the audience the experience of not only watching their journeys and daily routines (it's a sobering portrait of inner-city life), but also witnessing their maturation. Each takes a separate path along the way, stumbling over several obstacles (William suffers injuries, Arthur fails to meet his coach's high expectations); but James takes particular care to stress the importance and strong commitment of each character's family along the way, giving the film a essential center.

As written by renowned film critic Penelope Gilliatt and directed by John Schlesinger, this complicated love triangle among three upscale Londoners was a milestone for its time, not simply for its nonchalant treatment of a homosexual relationship, but for illustrating the way sensible adults will negotiate for love, even if it's inconvenient or destined to fail. A doctor in his forties, Daniel (Peter Finch, proving his greatness seven years beforeNetwork) loves the much younger artist Bob (Murray Head), who also loves employment counselor Alex (Glenda Jackson at her finest). There's no deception between them--just the troubling dilemma of three lovers with differing degrees of certainty and commitment. Bob's relative blandness is the film's only weakness, but it's tolerable in a drama so deeply understanding of complex human behavior. Deliberately paced but immensely rewarding to the attentive viewer, this was Schlesinger's follow-up toMidnight Cowboy--two great films by a director in his prime.--Jeff Shannon", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 555377}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.5, "brand": "", "asin": "6304005962", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Q9AWF6K5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Sunday Bloody Sunday [VHS]"}
{"description": "John Travolta is Vic Deakins, a bomber pilot who launches a devilish plan to hijack two nuclear missiles for big-time extortion. Vic never sweats, spews out great one-liners, knocks off money men with glee, toys with killing half a million people... he even smokes!If you giggled at his \"Ain't it cool\" line from the trailer, you're in the right frame of mind for this comedic action film. Never as gritty or semi-realistic--or for that matter as heart-thumping--as the originalDie Hard,Broken Arrowstill delivers. If Travolta is cast against type, everyone else is by the numbers; Christian Slater as Hale, the earnest copilot looking to foil the plot, Samantha Mathis as the brave park ranger caught in the middle, Frank Whaley as an eager diplomat, Delroy Lindo as a right-minded colonel. As with his previous script (the superiorSpeed), writer Graham Yost moves everything quickly along as Hale and the ranger try to cut off Deakins's plan over a variety of terrains. We have plane crashes, car chases, a pursuit through an abandoned mine, a helicopter-train shootout, and lots of fighting between boys. Each time Hale finds himself perfectly in place to foil Deakins. You're suppose to laugh at the unbelievable situations. That's whereArrowis deceptive: its tone is right for the laughter compared to the mean-spirited Schwarzenegger and Stallone action films with labored jokes. Hong Kong master director John Woo (The Killer,Hard Target) pulls out all the stops--slow motion of Hale and Deakins's gymnastic gun play, nifty stunts, countdowns to doomsday. Woo may know action, but he needs more guidance in creating unique and stunning special effects. This is action entertainment at its cheesiest. Travolta and Woo later reteamed forFace/Off.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["6304765789", "6303447589", "6301643410", "6304259131", "6301208773", "6305017271", "6303824382", "6303313345", "6303269834", "0790748169", "6301888901", "630300394X"], "also_viewed": ["6303020089"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 476773}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 0.08, "brand": "", "asin": "6304078250", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51KFF80AVML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Broken Arrow [VHS]"}

{"description": "Some people may sneer at this 1965 musical, but the truth is the film has earned its status as a perennially watchable romantic-drama, largely on the strength of a fun story and chemistry between stars Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer. Veteran filmmaker Robert Wise (The Day the Earth Stood Still) mostly stays out of the way of the film's appealing elements, which include a based-on-fact tale of Austria's von Trapp family, who fled their Nazi-occupied country in 1938. Andrews is delightful and even fascinating as Maria, who sheds her tomboyish ways as a novice nun to accept the mantle of adulthood, becoming matron of the motherless von Trapp clan. Plummer is matinee-idol handsome and gives a smart performance to boot, and the cast of young people and kids who make up the singing von Trapp children make a strong impression. Based on the Rodgers and Hammerstein stage musical, the score includes such winners as \"Maria\" and the future John Coltrane hit \"My Favorite Things.\"--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["6304400551", "6304178352", "6305123616", "B00000JS61", "6305282927", "B00000F6D1", "630233683X", "6304151306", "6302526574", "6303494390", "0792839846", "0792839129", "155890641X", "6303215734", "0788802194", "0788812807", "6301390725", "6303314015", "0788812408", "630150528X", "0790744759", "6303444202", "6300263673", "6302787068", "6304401132", "6302320402", "0788805533", "B00004TRD5", "6300246787", "6303854311", "B000056BRF", "0788805843", "0792151712", "B0041GWWUK", "6304500831", "6302091632", "6303168507", "630197736X", "6301586026", "6300207919", "6302642248", "6300215695", "0788806270", "B00005LL26", "B0000048YM", "6304089767", "5559477621", "6300275310", "6305229449", "6302178924", "6300277089", "6305750750", "6304331851", "6302936381", "B00000JKNP", "6300181111", "B0000AQZYM", "6300215814", "6300215830", "6300274195", "B002M2Z3BA", "6300213668", "B000035Z2S", "0788803743", "B00000491O", "B00000I1EM", "B00005RRG3", "B002HK9IDQ", "6301796535", "6305940932", "0783222955", "6303315305", "6302271991", "6301966317", "B00004RV8M", "0792840836", "6304100507", "6301972279", "0792837614", "6304546262", "B00005RRG5", "6303929338", "6302150620", "6300182304", "6305326940", "078881172X", "B0000E32WB", "6302816246", "6300215741", "6301792734", "B0000633ZP", "0800132009", "B00005RRG6", "B0002F6BQU", "B000059HH1", "6305177473", "B0000VCZKM", "6301971531", "0792839749"], "bought_together": ["6304400551"], "also_viewed": ["6304400551", "6304178352", "6303314015", "6305123616", "155890641X", "0788812408", "B00000JS61", "0788802194", "6302526574", "6302642248", "0792839129", "6305282927", "B00000F6D1", "078881172X", "6304500831", "6300274268", "6302158095", "6303215734", "B000035Z2S", "6304151306", "6304143184", "0792151712", "0788805843", "6304401132", "6302787068", "6300213668", "0788806270", "6301969707", "630233683X", "6305326940", "0792839846", "6305750750", "B00005LL26", "6302178924", "6304978286", "5559477621", "6303036813", "6303494390", "B00000JKNP", "6304539258", "6304873441", "6301792769", "6304290888", "6304718551", "B0041GWWUK", "B000003KHS", "6304089767", "6303929338", "6302091632", "6302961572", "B0007KTBIU", "6300263673", "6303675212", "6301752627", "6301792734", "B00FWMVVLS", "0783229011", "6304539274", "B00004TRD5"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 84952}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.94, "brand": "", "asin": "6304117752", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51AESVTB4DL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Sound of Music [VHS]"}

{"description": "George Romero's 1978 follow-up to his classicNight of the Living Deadis quite terrifying and gory (those zombies do like the taste of living flesh).

This time, we follow the fortunes of four people who lock themselves inside a shopping mall to get away from the marauding dead and who then immerse themselves in unabashed consumerism, taking what they want from an array of clothing and jewelry shops, making gourmet meals, etc. It is Romero's take on Louis XVI in the modern world: keep the starving masses at bay and crank up the insulated indulgence.

{"description": "Vincent Price gives an atypically restrained performance as the sole survivor of a worldwide plague that revives its victims as bloodthirsty vampires. During the day, he canvasses his abandoned hometown, tracking down and stalking his former friends and neighbors, always making sure to return before nightfall, when the dead rise to assault his fortified house. Hope arrives in the form of an apparently normal young woman (Franca Bettoia), but her agenda proves to be even more sinister than that of the vampires.Based on the 1954 novel by coscripter Matheson (whose displeasure with the final product spurred the use of a pseudonym), this Italian-made production is best known for its influence on George Romero'sNight of the Living Dead. The similarities between the two films go beyond the presence of shuffling zombies and housebound heroes; both feature taboo-breaking scenes of interfamilial murder, and both end on bleak, dystopian notes. WhileThe Last Man on Earthlacks the political and darkly satirical shadings (and graphic gore) that makeNight of the Living Deada more memorable experience, the combination of Bava-esque Gothic atmosphere and bleak, documentary-style camerawork by directors Ragona and Salkow (the brother of Price's agent Lester Salkow) lend themselves to moments of pure frisson that compare laudably to Romero's film.  Matheson's novel also provided the source material for the awkward 1971 Charlton Heston vehicleThe Omega Man.

{"description": "This Academy Award winner for Best Picture is a sweeping soap opera about the guests at the Grand Hotel. Several plots intertwine, but mostly it's about Stars! Stars! Stars! Greta Garbo, Joan Crawford, Wallace Beery, and both Barrymore brothers head up the cast. Garbo is luminous as Grusinskaya, the neurotic and famous-but-slipping dancer and, yes, she \"vonts to be alone.\" John Barrymore is a cat burglar with blue blood and a heart of gold, and Lionel Barrymore happily caroms off him as Mr. Kringelein, a dying man who wants to live out the time he has left with the rich. Joan Crawford is perhaps the biggest surprise of the movie: as Flaemmchen, a young career girl trying to decide between secretary and tart, she is uncharacteristically funny, vivacious, and downright bubbly. Along the way we discover that money, fame, and titles don't guarantee happiness, and being a jewel thief doesn't necessarily make you a bad person.

{"description": "The swashbuckler genre bumped into science fiction in 1954 for one of Hollywood's great entertainments. The Jules Verne story of adventure under the sea was Walt Disney's magnificent debut into live-action films. A professor (Paul Lukas) seeks the truth about a legendary sea monster in the years just after the Civil War. When his ship is sunk, he, his aide (Peter Lorre), and a harpoon master (Kirk Douglas) survive to discover that the monster is actually a metal submarine run by Captain Nemo (James Mason). Along with the rollicking adventure, it's fun to see the future technology that Verne dreamed up in hisnovel, including diving equipment and sea farming. The film's physical prowess is anchored by the Nautilus, an impressive full-scale gothic submarine complete with red carpet and pipe organ. In the era of big sets,20,000&nbsp;Leaguesset a precedent for films shot on the water and deservedly won Oscars for art direction and special effects. Lost in the inventiveness of the film and great set pieces including a giant squid attack are two great performances. Mason is the perfect Nemo, taut and private, clothed in dark fabric that counters the Technicolor dreamboat that is the beaming red-and-white-stripe-shirted Kirk Douglas as the heroic Ned Land. The film works as peerless family adventure nearly half a century later.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300270130", "B00005RRG6", "6302098424", "B00000623Y", "6304293941", "6304293925", "B000HDNPM0", "0767809262", "6302091632", "630150528X", "0800132009", "B00005RRG3", "B000006212", "155890641X", "078881172X", "B0000068ZQ", "6302413435", "B000055ZJP", "6300246868", "6302271991", "0800100832", "6304500718", "6301744160", "B00005RRG5", "6301628454", "6300182304", "0783235607", "6304500726", "6302271959", "0788811207", "6304400810", "0790743159", "B0000022WA", "6302962048", "6302354110", "B000F3FTIA", "B00000F6D1", "0784001847", "6303494390", "6301976622", "630402925X", "0792841026", "6302843308", "B00004CIOV", "B00000I0V5", "6300183513", "6303257801", "B000056BRF", "B000M5BRX2"], "bought_together": ["6300270130"], "also_viewed": ["B00000623Y", "B00005RRG3", "B00005RRG6", "B00005RRG7", "6303562205", "155890641X", "6304293925", "078881172X", "6304675151", "6303983812", "B000E8JO3C", "6300275310", "B000CR7RH0", "B0000022WA", "B00004R996", "B00008G1PY", "B0002V7T7O", "B00005RRG5", "0788805533", "6304501153", "6304978286"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 261365}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.97, "brand": "", "asin": "6304291698", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51MGN4453PL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "20,000 Leagues Under the Sea [VHS]"}
{"description": "\"The love impulse in man,\" says a psychiatrist inBringing Up Baby, \"frequently reveals itself in terms of conflict.\" That's for sure. For a primer on the rules and regulations of the classic screwball comedy, which throws love and conflict into close proximity, look no further. A straight-laced paleontologist (Cary Grant) loses a dinosaur bone to a dog belonging to free-spirited heiress Katharine Hepburn. In trying to retrieve said bone, Grant is drawn into the vortex surrounding the delicious Hepburn, which becomes a flirtatious pas de deux that will transform both of them. Director Howard Hawks plays the complications as a breathless escalation of their \"love impulse,\" yet the movie is nonetheless romantic for all its speed. (Hawks'sHis Girl Friday, also with Grant, goes even faster.) Grant and Hepburn are a match made in movie heaven, in sync with each other throughout. Not a great box-office success when first released,Bringing Up Babyhas since taken its place as a high-water mark of the screwball form, and it was used as a model for Peter Bogdanovich'sWhat's Up, Doc?--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301964012", "0790743213", "B0000040EO", "6301278410", "6300215628", "B0045HCJHG", "0780614097", "630290899X", "B000PYKZYC", "0792839846", "B002ZG988M", "630299005X", "0783235593", "0783222955", "0782006809", "6302227127", "6301798600", "6301647734", "6301797957", "0783221347", "6302278929", "B00004RFFA", "6304429274"], "bought_together": ["6301964012", "6300215628"], "also_viewed": ["B001GUYAZY", "6301826558", "B008D1Q1VU", "B007H7OQW2", "6301937112", "630197350X", "B0045HCJHG", "B006TTC5WC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 297012}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.27, "brand": "", "asin": "6304383177", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51TZGAV0X6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Bringing Up Baby [VHS]"}

{"description": "A grandly entertaining, old-fashioned adventure based on the Rudyard Kipling short story,The Man Who Would Be Kingis the kind of rousing epic about which people said, even in 1975, &quot;Wow! They don't make 'em like that anymore!&quot; When director John Huston (The Maltese Falcon,The Treasure of the Sierra Madre,The African Queen) first started trying to make the film, with Gable and Bogart, the project was derailed by the latter's death. It was a few decades before Huston was able to finally realize his dream movie--and with an unimprovable cast. Sean Connery and Michael Caine are, respectively, Daniel Dravot and Peachy Carnahan, a pair of lovably roguish British soldiers who set out to make their fortunes by conning the priests of remote Kafiristan into making them kings. It's a rollicking tale, an epic satire of imperialism, and the good-natured repartee shared by Caine and Connery is pure gold. In today's screen adventures, humor is usually imposed on the material by a writer or director trying to make some kind of cleverly self-aware comment (&quot;Hey, we know it's a movie!&quot;), but that sort of jokiness can create so much ironic distance that it pushes the audience right out of the picture.

{"description": "The Allies had barely driven the Nazis out of Rome when Roberto  Rosselini went to work onOpen City, considered by most to be his greatest work.  Shot on bits and short ends of scavenged film, this film helped define Italian neorealism.  Audiences were convinced that the actors were all amateurs (they weren't) and the whole film was improvised (it wasn't; the three screenwriters included Federico Fellini).  With its semidocumentary camera style and use of actual locations, the film does feel very real.  Of course, so does the opening half-hour ofSaving Private Ryan, and like that filmOpen Cityis at its heart a classic war yarn any Hollywood studio would feel at home with. The story involves members of the Italian underground trying to smuggle badly needed cash out of Nazi-occupied Rome to partisan fighters in the mountains, while the Nazis are hunting down one of the underground, a notorious freedom fighter and seditionist.  Anna Magnani (an actor well established in her own country who became an international star with this film) is often singled out for her portrayal as the pregnant, unwed woman who gets caught up in the action on her wedding day, but the entire cast is topnotch.  The sparse subtitles are both a blessing and a curse--there is less to read, which allows the viewer to concentrate on the visuals, but there are times when non-Italian-speakers will feel like they're missing out on some juicy dialogue.--Geof Miller", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305081034", "B001LMU1C8", "B00005JKGO", "B006MHZ32K", "B000I0RNV6", "B006H3KQP8", "B000G8NXYQ", "B00005QAPH", "B0000WN0ZK", "B0001ZIVAA", "B00009ME9Z", "B00005NC66", "B003D3Y64C", "B000NHG81A", "B0000C9JFR", "B000067IXK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002U6DVQ2", "6305081034", "B002X9CIZG", "0767802470"]}, "price": 49.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 240684}, "asin": "6305075573", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5101RB2FRFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Open City"}

{"description": "Prolific British filmmaker Lindsay Anderson weaves this small, evocative tale of young life at the crossroads in early 1960s Northern England. A rough, sullen young man (Richard Harris) working in the local coal mines begins to make a name for himself as a star rugby player, but even as he begins to fall in love he cannot escape the harsh realities of the bleak life around him. The rugby sequences in the film are striking, but no more so than the depiction of downtrodden people living in the shadow of industry and corruption that too often crushes their spirit. Harris in one of his first roles, is remarkably effective as an unlikable but sympathetic figure trying against hope to savor the small joys life has to offer, and the film also features the debut of renowned actress Glenda Jackson.

{"description": "This legendary seven-hour silent French serial, one of the earliest and most original gangster films, combines realism and fantasy. Written and directed by Louis Feuillade,Les Vampiresconcerns an intrepid reporter's pursuit of a strange gang of jewel thieves terrorizing Paris. The gang ambitiously seeks political, psychological, and sexual domination of the city's social elite, with the seductive Irma Vep (an anagram of \"vampire\") as its brazen leader. While slow going at first, the 10-part serial becomes more and more fascinating with each episode, thanks in large part to the alluring Musidora as Irma Vep. Because of her many guises and frightful charms, she truly becomes a vampire of sorts. Feuillade achieves a subversive, nightmarish atmosphere amid the everyday goings-on of the city. Filmed on the streets and back alleys of World War I Paris, the 1915 picture was  a huge commercial success, though temporarily banned by Paris's chief of police for glamorizing crime.--Bill Desowitz", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 690620}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 54.97, "brand": "", "asin": "6305166552", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/211ZBHS04SL.jpg", "title": "Les Vampires [VHS]"}
{"description": "Francis Ford Coppola was working as an assistant to Roger Corman when he made this, his feature debut.  The story goes that Corman let Coppola make the film so long as he could work around the shooting schedule of the film they were working on together, and the results are impressive given the budget constraints. Or maybebecauseof the budget constraints.  The story concerns the family at Castle Haloran, the secrets surrounding the death of young Kathleen, and an axe murderer who seems to be picking away at all present.  Coppola's deft direction keeps this from being a routine ghost story, using light and dark in his compositions to create tension and suspense.  The film has an interesting way of spanning the traditional ghost story and the more modern gore-fests that we're used to.  I have one bone to pick with the manufacturer of this disc: the transfer to DVD was made from tape.  This is evident from the way the frames roll repeatedly during the last 15 minutes of the film, and the tape bunches a few times leaving video artifacts. DVD consumers want all the benefits of this medium, and not to have the degraded quality of tape preserved on it.  If this is the only way you can get this film, at least the price is reasonable.

{"description": "You might have heard people say they'd kill to get into Harvard. Well, here's a film that takes it literally.  There's a legendary rule at many universities, so the film posits, that if your roommate commits suicide you can take a 4.0&nbsp;GPA for the semester.  Tim (Matthew Lillard ofScreamfame, in yet another of his patented psycho roles) plans with his roommate Chris (Michael Vartan) to kill a third roommate Rand (Randall Batinkoff) so they can collect their 4.0s and get Chris a Harvard M.B.A.  As Chris says, \"Either it's a Harvard M.B.A. or you're flipping burgers.\"  No elevated thinker, Chris.  Rand is a cruel jerk to his Sandy Dennis-like girlfriend, Natalie (Tamara Craig Thomas), so it's hard to miss him when he's gone.  But that sentiment applies equally to nearly every other character in the picture, including Chris's girlfriend Emma (Keri Russell), who seems to be the most sympathetic of the group.  That's the movie's strength; you think you know everyone but you don't.  And that's also its greatest weakness; you need to know and like these people for the film to work.  If you can stomach these people (in which case counseling might be in order), the exceedingly twisty-turny plot  will keep you entertained to the last amazing revelation.  Otherwise, you might want to keep searching for a thriller that gives its people an inner life worth viewing.The Curvewas snatched from Sundance for a distribution deal by Trimark, but wound up in this direct-to-video release instead.--Jim Gay", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792840127", "0767824954", "0767837398", "B000F5WR4W", "B007XF0W3K", "B00003CXUP", "B004P7CN7W", "B00344EAN2", "B00005O5AX", "B00005JKJJ", "B000KHYN9C", "B002GHHHL0", "B00AEBB8QK", "B00BNWWVFG", "B002CVQAX6", "B0053TWVQE", "B000NJMJHK", "0783226845", "B00DNF1R74", "B000A0GP0Y", "B00A47BT7C", "B00BNWWUDY", "B00BDZV8ZM", "B00004YA67", "B000MV8ABS", "B009AMAJPA", "B000FFJZO2", "B00441GYVA", "0790736411", "B002LMSWN2", "B00013RC7K", "B0002WT4OE", "B000PAAJVU", "B004SUDQ1I", "6305065551", "B001URA5Y8", "B00005KAQP", "B00003CXKM", "B000WMFZK6", "B00BCMT2BI", "0792846443", "B000ASATZ8", "B00005UQ9W", "B000053VB2", "B00979KQD6", "B000CPH9PM", "6304711891", "B00006ZXSL", "B002ZG983M", "1573625779", "B0006N2EZ0", "B00AEFXT1S", "B00003CXPS", "B004HZY8OS", "B00004ZESE"], "bought_together": ["0767824954", "B004P7CN7W"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B009POCG2C", "0767824954"]}, "price": 5.96, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 71766}, "asin": "6305375577", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51SW1SWSGEL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Curve"}
{"description": "A year after his international breakthrough filmLa Strada, Federico Fellini and his leading lady/wife Giulietta Masina collaborated on another masterpiece, a magical mix of neorealism and romantic optimism set on the streets of Rome. Masina's moon-faced and bright-eyed Cabiria is a passionate streetwalker with a heart as big as Italy and the emotional spontaneity of a child, a woman with a hearty passion for life whose constant weakness is falling in love with mercenary creeps. For a couple of hours we share the dreams and disillusionments of Cabiria as she rattles around Rome before once again losing her heart. The bittersweet heartbreak is tempered with a soaring celebration of the human spirit: no other Fellini film offers such honest hope in the face of such bitter devastation. Fellini left the poor and the working class to revel in the decadence of Rome's high society for his next film,La Dolce Vita, a film that could have sprung from Cabiria's hilarious chance interlude with a matinee idol (played by Amedeo Nazzari). Rambling and leisurely paced,Nights of Cabiriais a sweet film of warmth and simple grace. It became the basis of Neil Simon's American musicalSweet Charity, with Shirley Maclaine taking Masina's role in Bob Fosse's film version.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300208591", "B000001A5E", "B001LMU1C8", "B00005QAPH", "6303855490", "6301224698", "B000GBEWMA"], "bought_together": ["B00005QAPH"], "also_viewed": ["B001LMU1C8", "B002U6DVQM"]}, "price": 28.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 186477}, "asin": "6305372594", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51WFJB4YR7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Nights of Cabiria [VHS]"}
{"description": "A massively underrated action thriller that kept Arnold Schwarzenegger occupied between mid-'80s blockbusters,Commandomay be one of the last shoot-out films ever to have real characters in it. Not, of course, that they're anything other than stereotypes, but they're painted with such detailed, positive strokes that it's impossible not to relate to them. Arnie plays a retired military special-ops officer whose daughter (played with an expert balance of cute/feisty by Alyssa Milano) is kidnapped by the baddest of bad guys, who'll only hand her back as and when he's assassinated a tiresome banana-republic president on their behalf. Needless to say, Arnie is deeply annoyed by this, rescues the moppet single-handed amid more bullets and explosions than you can shake a stuntman's pay cheque at, and... well, why spoil the fun by revealing any more? Co-star Rae Dawn Chong gets some nice one-liners as the innocent bystander who gets caught up in the mayhem.--Roger Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JA8B", "B00070FX5U", "B0002J58HO", "B00AKGG828", "B002GHHHME", "B00005JKIP", "B00005N5S5", "B00026ZG10", "B00HZMZ2FE", "B000BPL2FQ", "B00013RC8E", "B001VLBDD0", "B0000VD12I", "B0045HCJG2", "B000056PMU", "6305767866", "0783225504", "0783226926", "B0004Z33G4", "B0001Z37HM", "0783241895", "B000RJO56E", "B000E0WJLE", "B001B3LIOC", "B00007AJG4", "B0015XHP2C", "B0004Z33EG", "B00004XMSC", "B000QXDCLU", "B00006RCOC", "0783225946", "1558908846", "B0045HCJGC", "B00004Y87O", "B00BLF9FOK", "B0015XHP4A", "B001TK80C0", "B0004Z33EQ", "B001M9ELQC", "B0004Z33F0", "B00005N7Z1", "6304602944", "B0006GANOQ", "B00AEFYDM2", "B0002S94CK", "6304806434", "B000QUCQX8", "B0000542CD", "0783228465", "B000O77SRC", "B00005O06W", "B000U1ZV8K", "0792846850", "B005COLETU", "B001T21R5U", "0790732238", "0790742004", "B001FB55HQ", "0790729342", "B00004STDN", "B002GHHHH4", "B002AS466O", "B002TVQ4CG", "B0045HCIWM", "B000U1ZV62", "B00BTYRB2G", "6304712898", "B0045HCIWW", "B00008G8M4", "B00AEFXRG0", "0790729695", "6304711891", "B000QUCRB4", "0790731932", "B000MGBSE4", "B00005R2IS", "B004CJQVJE", "B000FI8MPW", "B000O78KW4", "B00AEFYUQQ", "B001451HX4", "B00AEBB86U", "0767821548", "B00005O06Q", "B00031V23K", "0792835735", "6305245487", "B002AT8KA6", "B00AEFXKZ8", "B000O77SRM", "B0000C3I6U", "B00000ILDD", "B002ZG98LO", "B00H1RMWYW", "B001KRVLCI", "B00AEFXIIW", "B003AWRMA6", "B000N4SHNK", "B003ASLJMM", "B004CJQVO4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00070FX5U", "B0002J58HO", "B00005JA8B", "0800177975"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 189009}, "asin": "6305364664", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71A9FHT05GL._SY300_.gif", "title": "Commando"}

{"description": "Matthew Broderick makes up for years of wet-noodle performances with his low-key but unsparing characterization of Jim McAllister, a high school teacher at George Washington Carver High School in Omaha, Nebraska. Driven by a strange mixture of loathing and lust for pathologically overachieving student Tracy Flick (Reese Witherspoon), McAllister encourages a dim but popular athlete, Paul (Chris Klein fromAmerican Pie), to run against her in the election for student-council president. Director-cowriter Alexander Payne (Citizen Ruth) turns this deceptively simple premise into a complex and scathing comedy of ambition, corruption, and desire, all at its most naked and petty. Every scene contains some painfully funny nuance that will make you wince in a mixture of astonishment and empathy. Witherspoon flips effortlessly back and forth from adolescent vulnerability to steely-eyed strength; she's becoming a contemporary Carole Lombard. The movie itself feels like a magnificent throwback to the richly layered comedies of the '30s, which drew their humor from sharply drawn characters and twisting plots instead of explosions of bodily fluids.

{"description": "Of all theStar Trekoriginal series DVDs, Volume 14 will surely remain one of the most popular, for it offers the first-ever appearance of Klingons (in \"Errand of Mercy\") and the episode many fans consider the finest of all \"classicTrek\" adventures.In \"Errand of Mercy,\" war between the Klingons and the Federation is imminent, and it's up to Captain  Kirk (William Shatner) to persuade the peaceful, agrarian planet Organia to sign on with the good guys before the Klingons overwhelm the place. Organia is in a strategically valuable position for whichever  warring side claims it first, but the Organians don't seem  to care. Kirk and First Officer Spock (Leonard Nimoy) make an awfully good  pitch for Federation protection, but Organian leaders reject  the offer as a tacit invitation to violence, taking little heed of a Klingon invasion and earning the enmity of both Kirk and Klingon Commander Kor (John  Colicos). Essentially a Cold War satire disguised as a Federation-Klingon  showdown, \"Errand of Mercy\" is the brainchild  of producer-writer Gene&nbsp;L. Coon, who makes a wonderfully convincing case for  the absurdity of each side's claim to moral superiority. Highlights include the Butch-and-Sundance banter between Kirk and Spock as they form a two-man Resistance movement. The  episode is directed by John Newland, best known as the host of the  supernatural television series,One Step Beyond.\"The City on the Edge of Forever\" begins with a medical accident that leaves Dr. McCoy (DeForest Kelley) a  paranoid madman. Leaping through a time portal to Earth's Great Depression of  the 1930s, McCoy causes disastrous changes to history, forcing Kirk and Spock to follow him and undo whatever disruptive action he took  centuries before. There, Kirk meets a kindly social worker, Edith Keeler  (Joan Collins), with whom he falls in love before realizing her fate is the key to a restored future. A shattering drama, \"City\" brings out the best in the cast and production  teams, looking like a feature film that found its way onto television. The  background on this show is equally compelling and sometimes hysterically  funny, beginning with a highly fanciful script by Harlan Ellison (including a  scene with cast members riding a carousel that passes in and out the side of  a mountain) that was either rewritten by series creator Gene Roddenberry or producer Gene L. Coon, depending on who's telling the story. Ironically,  Ellison's original version won a Writer's Guild award while the revision  captured a Hugo, but the real prize is the episode itself.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000055Z4J", "B00001MXXW", "0792160959", "B00004Y62Z", "6305910464", "0792160932", "B000059XU0", "6305513406", "B00004Y630", "6305744882", "6305744858", "6305755035", "B000022TTP", "B00004W5UI", "B00001MXXS", "B000059XTZ", "B00005ASGJ", "B00005M2D0", "B00005J6RF", "B00005N5SE", "B00005QAPY", "B00005BCK6", "B000055Z4I", "B000022TTI", "B00005J6RE", "B00005M2CZ", "B002I9Z8AS", "B00005BCK7", "B0002JJBZO", "6305513414", "B00005KHK4", "B002I9Z8BM", "B0000AUHOH", "B00005ASGI", "B00005QTAR", "B00004W5UH", "B002I9Z8EO", "B00DB97LRC", "B00005N5SF", "B0000UJL96", "B004IIPUSC", "B00005KHK3", "B000CCBCIA", "B00005NVDI", "B00005JKHP", "B000UX6TKC", "B00005QTAS", "B00004XPPC", "B003XURDAY", "B00005NVDJ", "B00005Q79B", "B000A2S7VM"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001DHXT6G", "6305513406", "B00004Y630", "B0002JJBZO"]}, "price": 65.64, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 365908}, "asin": "6305910529", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/517K3CFDW5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Star Trek - The Original Series, Vol. 14, Episodes 27 &amp; 28: Errand of Mercy/ The City on the Edge of Forever"}

{"description": "Slumming among the locals of a small New York town, Kelley Morse (Chris Klein), graduating senior at a posh prep school and all-around insufferable rich kid, engages the testosterone of one of the hicks (Josh Hartnett) when he flirts with the guy's girlfriend, Samantha (LeeLee Sobieski). A car chase ensues, resulting in Samantha's family's diner getting blown up, which in turn lands the boys in hot water with the law. The upshot is the snotty rich kid is sentenced to help the locals rebuild the diner. A romance develops between Kelley and Samantha, apparently because they like a particular Robert Frost poem. So now they're deep, see. But then their love is tested when Samantha contracts Ali MacGraw disease. You know, that's the sudden disease Ali McGraw gets inLove Story--really an excuse to emphasize the strength of the characters' love. You don't know what you got till it's gone, right? This film would be pretty bad if the performances weren't so engaging, especially LeeLee Sobieski's, who seems to be channeling Helen Hunt in this movie. Though Chris Klein never makes us believe for an instant that his arrogant character could make the changes he does, or that his and Sobieski's characters could ever really get together. The script is too thin to support any motivations, and the film falls into formula weepy territory to appeal to teen tear ducts. Lovers of weepies might overlook the film's plot weaknesses in favor of the strong performances and the prospect of a good cry.--Jim Gay", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00003CY5P", "6305907110", "B005Z9MFRC", "B00008G7UM", "B000P0J0DS", "B00AMEZDJW", "B004SIP9X8", "B00447L4KA", "B00003CXGJ", "B004P7CN7W", "B00004XPPD", "B000053VB2", "B004SEUJ9Q", "B000067J1O", "B00003CXTG", "B00005RYKU", "B00006ZXSL", "B00005U8EL", "B003M05KU0", "B00005QW6W", "B00000JGHK", "B0000524E5", "B00005JCCB", "B00067BBMS", "B00066FAZ8", "B00AEBB9UU", "B000A5045Q", "B00DW5IL92", "B0002WT4OE", "B002XUBDRY", "B00005JKJS", "B000053VB5", "B001LXIDWM", "B00006ZXSO", "B00006ZXSQ", "B000NVIGLQ", "B000065V3H", "B00002SSKI", "B00003CXL7", "B003NHRIVQ", "B00013WWT8", "B00AEFY99O", "B000GB775E", "B002GIBVWA", "B00005JKWM", "B00003CXK7", "B00006ZXSK", "B000EQ45CO", "078322933X", "B00HW3EZZE", "6305692572", "B000S0SYIM", "B00008K77D", "B00AEFYQE2", "B00JK31YS0", "B0026MP1CC", "B003L20IHE", "B004SEUIZG", "B00004RD1X", "B000683VI4", "B00006ZXSI", "B000765IJK", "0783235380", "B00DVD5SBE", "B00005YUPC", "B002DU39J4", "B00081U7HC", "B0001AVZ9E", "B00008977A", "B00006HAWN", "B00000F0AD", "B000J3OTSM", "B00005JG6N", "0767821769", "B0000A2ZNN", "B0045HCJJ4", "B005YFGJFG", "B000PMFRYC", "B00H9LHVHI", "B009H3LP82", "B002ZG989G", "B002GHHHKG", "B0000C3I99", "B00007E2F5", "B0000CDRVU", "6305428549", "B00AEBB8JM", "6305531293", "B00009AOBI", "0767824954", "B004SIP8LG", "B0071HPP3M", "B0014DZ2WS", "B00DMDE02Q", "B00B96TGQS", "B00009WVSL", "B00441GYVA", "6305433917", "B000089799", "B0050UEVIM"], "bought_together": ["B000P0J0DS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00447L4KA", "B00003CY5P", "078322933X", "B000P0J0DS"]}, "price": 11.55, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 122300}, "asin": "6305962979", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51AFYRBKGPL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Here on Earth"}
{"description": "Only two years separateThe Fourth Man, the final Dutch language movie by director Paul Verhoeven, and the explosive commencement of his Hollywood career. Controversy raged about violence inFlesh & Blood,RoboCopand everything else he made thereafter. Yet controversy has always been a part of the filmmaker's work. This savage comedy shocker could well be seen as a trial run forBasic Instinct, since it features an ice-cold seductress (Ren&#xE9;e Soutendijk) with mysterious motivations and sexual preferences. The hallucinatory tale follows a novelist (Jeroen Krabb&#xE9;) first falling for her, and then feverishly investigating whether she's a serial husband killer. The film is full of what would soon be recognized as Verhoeven trademarks: a little blasphemy, a lot of nudity, dispassionate characters, and hidden agendas. One of the aspects that caught the eye of international audiences was the film's colorful lighting and camerawork. This was from Jan de Bont, who, thanks in large part to Verhoeven, would go on to directSpeedand others.

{"description": "Yasujiro Ozu's economical style reaches its zenith in this deceptively simple 1953 story of an elderly couple in rural Japan who go to visit their married children in Tokyo. Chishu Ryo (Ozu's favorite performer) and Chieko Higashiyama star as the aging parents who find a cold welcome waiting for them from their two urbanized children, too busy with work and their own lives to pay them any attention. After a miserable trip to a noisy spa, the mother spends a pleasant night with the widow of their other son (who had died in the war) while the father drinks the evening away with old friends. But on their return trip, the mother falls ill and the family reunites one last time at her sickbed. Within this simple framework, Ozu creates a quiet but profound drama of the changing face of Japanese culture and the loss of traditional values in modern society. Described by critics as Japan's most \"Japanese\" director, Ozu's style by this time had become firmly established: the entire film is shot from an unmoving camera 36 inches from the floor (the point of view of an observer kneeling on a tatami mat), edited in a subtly off-center manner and paced at a placid tempo. Ozu's graceful style, understated direction, and rich evocation of character creates an elegantly realized world of dignity in the face of disappointment and loss.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302969425"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 552474}, "asin": "B000006D1S", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51QX2HMS9CL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Tokyo Story [VHS]"}

But Hal Holbrook is so spectacular in his one-man performance that you could swear you were listening to Twain himself.  The gravelly voice, the lined face, the slow shuffle, and cigar-induced throat clearings seem so natural that you'll have difficulty recognizing Holbrook beneath the white suit, the gray hair, and the handlebar mustache.Mark Twain Tonight!began as a Broadway show in the 1960s and was filmed as a CBS special in 1967.  Yet you'd never know it, because the humor, which is more than a century old, is still laugh-out-loud funny today. Twain--I mean, Holbrook--gives a monologue that is rambling, intelligent, and humorous as he culls together commentary from a variety of Twain sources.

{"description": "The film that answers the immortal question: what species is Gonzo?  Kermit the Frog's curly-nosed friend feels alone in the world. When his breakfast cereal starts spelling out questions and he hears voices, Gonzo is convinced he must be from outer space, and his alien brothers are coming to earth. Of course, there are evil scientists (led by Jeffrey Tambor) who kidnap Gonzo to learn his secrets (like \"What do you do with a nose like that?\"). The usual brand of merriment from the gang is in good order, especially in the opening scene when the Muppets start the morning under one roof.

{"description": "It's difficult to create a film that's fast paced, exciting, and aesthetically appealing without diluting its dialogue.Run Lola Run, directed and written by Tom Tykwer, is an enchanting balance of pace and narrative, creating a universal parable that leaps over cultural barriers. This is the story of young Lola (Franka Potente) and her boyfriend Manni (Moritz Bleibtreu). In the space of 20&nbsp;minutes, they must come up with 100,000&nbsp;deutsche marks to pay back a seedy gangster, who will be less than forgiving when he finds out that Manni incompetently lost his cash to an opportunistic vagrant. Lola, confronted with one obstacle after another, rides an emotional roller coaster in her high-speed efforts to help the hapless Manni--attempting to extract the cash first from her double-dealing father (appropriately a bank manager), and then by any means necessary. From this point nothing goes right for either protagonist, but just when you think you've figured out the movie, the director introduces a series of brilliant existential twists that boggle the mind. Tykwer uses rapid camera movements and innovative pauses to explore the theme of cause and effect. Accompanied by a pulse-poundingsoundtrack, we follow Lola through every turn and every heartbreak as she and Manni rush forward on a collision course with fate. There were a variety of original and intelligent films released in 1999, but perhaps none were as witty and clever as this little gem--one of the best foreign films of the year.--Jeremy Storey", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 496767}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.74, "brand": "", "asin": "B000021Y74", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51KYAD2YAVL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Run Lola Run [VHS]"}
{"description": "Volume 5 from the DVD collection of originalStar Trekprograms  includes \"What Are Little Girls Made Of?\" Written by Robert Bloch (author of  the novelPsycho, the basis of Hitchcock's film), the episode finds  Captain Kirk (William Shatner) and nurse Christine Chapel (Majel Barrett)  beaming down to planet Exo&nbsp;III, where Christine is to be reunited with her  fianc&eacute;, Dr. Roger Korby (Michael Strong). The meeting is less than  joyful,  however, when it becomes clear that Korby has been developing androids that  he intends to spread throughout the galaxy--using theEnterpriseas his  delivery vehicle. This was certainly the first significant performance for  Majel Barrett in theTrekfamily; longtime fans know she went on to  play Lwaxana Troi onThe Next Generation(and Mrs.&nbsp;Gene Roddenberry in  real life). An entertaining episode all around, with the notion of an android  Kirk somehow amusing. (Maybe it was the android who sang on that notorious  Shatner album.) Fans of '60s TV will also enjoy the performance of Ted Cassidy (the original Lurch from TV'sThe Addams Family) as the giant android, Ruk.Also on this DVD is \"Dagger of the Mind,\" another mad-doctor drama. This  time, Kirk delivers supplies to a penal colony on Tantalus&nbsp;V, where he  meets the renowned Dr.&nbsp;Tristan Adams. Adams has been working on the  development of a neural neutralizer to control and manipulate dangerous  patients. When Kirk threatens to expose him as a dangerous megalomaniac,  Adams uses the technology on the unfortunate captain. This tense piece set in  a madhouse atmosphere makes for a riveting episode, with a few unhinged  performances adding to the fun.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000022TTP", "6305744858", "B000059XU0", "B00001MXXW", "B00001MXXS", "6305744882", "6305513406", "0792160932", "B00004W5UI", "6305513414", "B00004Y62Z", "B0002JJBZO", "6305910464", "B00005ASGJ", "6305755035", "6305910537", "0792160959", "B000055Z4J", "B00005KHK3", "B00005BCK7", "B00005ASGI", "B00004Y630", "B00004W5UH", "B00005QTAR", "B000055Z4I", "B00005J6RF", "B00005J6RE", "B00005BCK6", "B000A2S7VM", "B00005M2CZ", "B00005M2D0", "B00005KHK4", "B00005QAPY", "B00005NVDI", "B00005Q79B", "B000059XTZ", "B00005N5SE", "B00005QTAS", "B00005NVDJ", "B00005N5SF", "B004IIPUSC", "B000PMBEAI", "6305755043", "6305669392"], "bought_together": ["B000022TTP"], "buy_after_viewing": ["6305910537", "B00005N5SE", "B000055Z4J", "B00001MXXW"]}, "price": 14.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 329803}, "asin": "B000022TTI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RYDJB0F1L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Star Trek - The Original Series, Vol. 5, Episodes 10 &amp; 11: What Are Little Girls Made Of?/ Dagger of the Mind"}

Yet another entry in the horror subgenre of giant animals running amok,Lake Placidfeatures a giant crocodile that has somehow found its way to an isolated lake in Maine. The absurdity of crocodiles in Maine sets the tone for the entire movie, which has no ambitions beyond mixing a little fright with a little humor.

{"description": "The Art of Waris the first action movie with a hero who works for the United Nations--the U.N. Covert Operations Unit, to be specific. Who knew there was such a thing? Wesley Snipes plays Shaw, their top operative, who's unafraid of dropping several stories from one ledge of a skyscraper to another. When the Chinese ambassador is assassinated, it threatens the stability of an impending trade agreement that the secretary-general (played by Donald Sutherland) has worked so hard to achieve. Shaw gets arrested for the assassination, but who's really responsible? Is it the wily Chinese capitalist? A seemingly affable FBI agent? Only a lovely U.N. interpreter (Marie Matiko) believes he's innocent, especially when someone tries to knock her off and Shaw is the only person she can turn to... well, you get the idea. The script is neither original nor comprehensible, but that's not why you'd want to watch a movie likeThe Art of War--it's the action. And the action is pretty good, particularly earlier on when the confusions of the plot don't matter as much. Michael Biehn (The Terminator,The Rock) does a serviceable job as one of Shaw's associates, Anne Archer (Fatal Attraction,Clear and Present Danger) tries to seem complicated as the head of the Covert Operations Unit, and Maury Chaykin (The Mask of Zorro,Devil in a Blue Dress) is dependable as ever as the FBI guy.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001AK3S4E", "B002BOEEVO", "B000PISZ7M", "0790732149", "B004F7BGBG", "B000B8GT92", "B000ELL1Q2", "B0009FU0ZG", "B002AT8KA6", "B000A1OFYQ", "B000HEVZ80", "0790736411", "B0010YVCB6", "B004SIPAP0", "630513345X", "B000QUCRB4", "B00061I294", "6305428115", "B0045HCJGC", "B002O3Z4WK", "B000JYW5BO", "B001N44BVQ", "B000056PNL", "B002A0KV6G", "B00AEFYUQQ", "B0045HCJ5S", "B00140PK82", "B008B9JTLI", "B00J11U54K", "B0002J58HO", "B009WGYXIS", "B0019EXZY4", "B0099KJFJ4", "B002GSXKNI", "B00596WEVI", "B00DU22OI6", "B00005N5S5", "B008E70EES", "6304698747", "B000XA5K48", "B000X1Z0C4", "B008NNY8PO", "B00BUC4TJ0", "B003VA3JZY", "B00003CXW4", "B000CEV3M8", "B0045HCJFS", "B00J5LXST0", "B000I0RNWU", "B00004Z1FX", "B004YCKJGU", "B002AT8K9W", "B002MJV77C", "B00CUDD0J8", "B000JJSL1W", "B0087OULG4", "B00JL6L4UY", "B0041QSZS8", "B000274T94", "B002GHHHME", "0780621603", "B000LC4Z7Q", "B00003CXGV", "B002AS464Q", "B00009ZPUA", "B001VLBDD0", "B004U7MR1O", "B00005OCJP", "B002AS466O", "B004H2P6II", "B00003CXR4", "B002FU8JTW", "0790732238", "B00AIBZMD6", "B00JVQ7RCS", "0767803434", "B000ENC5YW", "B00005JA8B", "B001JV5AZE", "B0001Z37HM", "B00003CXHJ", "B00009L1TA", "6305767866", "B00005UQ9T", "B000HDZKLO", "0783225946", "B007NE07VI", "B00BUAEYVK", "B000G5SILC", "B00BEJL6JK", "0767807588", "B004P8R9O8", "0767817745", "B001EDVNNU", "B002O3Z4XE", "B000E5N684", "B00AEBB9AA", "B005LAIGRS", "B000H5TH20", "B0001NBNDY"], "bought_together": ["B002BOEEVO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0790732149", "B002DY9KQ6", "B000BYA5G4", "B003Q6D2B4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 41525}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.7, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00003CXMV", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5145yVg-h5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Art of War"}

{"description": "Employing shock techniques and sound design in a relentless sensory assault,Requiem for a Dreamis about nothing less than the systematic destruction of hope. Based on the novel by Hubert Selby Jr., and adapted by Selby and director Darren Aronofsky, this is undoubtedly one of the most effective films ever made about the experience of drug addiction (both euphoric and nightmarish), and few would deny that Aronofsky, in following his breakthrough filmPi, has pushed the medium to a disturbing extreme, thrusting conventional narrative into a panic zone of traumatized psyches and bodies pushed to the furthest boundaries of chemical tolerance. It's too easy to call this a cautionary tale; it's a guided tour through hell, with Aronofsky as our bold and ruthless host.The film focuses on a quartet of doomed souls, but it's Ellen Burstyn--in a raw and bravely triumphant performance--who most desperately embodies the downward spiral of drug abuse. As lonely widow Sara Goldfarb, she invests all of her dreams in an absurd self-help TV game show, jolting her bloodstream with diet pills and coffee while her son Harry (Jared Leto) shoots heroin with his best friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) and slumming girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly). They're careening toward madness at varying speeds, and Aronofsky tracks this gloomy process by endlessly repeating the imagery of their deadly routines. Tormented by her dietary regime, Sara even imagines a carnivorous refrigerator in one of the film's most memorable scenes. And yet... does any of this have a point? Is Aronofsky telling us anything that any sane person doesn't already know?Requiem for a Dreamis a noteworthy film, but watching it twice would qualify as masochistic behavior.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0057ZAA6W", "B00005JM23", "6305594333", "B0007CEXYK", "B00005YUPD", "078401213X", "1560252480", "B00H3JHGBC", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00005JMJG", "B000I0QL7I", "B0009A40ES", "B00049QQHI", "B00005ATQB", "B000LAZDPG", "B00003CXZ4", "0792838068", "B0000AC8LR", "0783229526", "6305692572", "B0041KKYEM", "B000QGEB1M", "B00008977H", "B001AR60GK", "B000MGB6NM", "B0045HCJ08", "6305313687", "B001TOD92C", "B00009Y3QI", "B000NO39FG", "B000JBXXYK", "B00008975Z", "6305162026", "B00004UEDQ", "B000068MC2", "B00606OZUY", "B00003CWQR", "B000ERVK4Y", "B000A7DVR2", "B000A9QK6E", "B00EUENWIY", "B0016MJ6T2", "B00005JPAR", "B00008MTXI", "B004SIP95G", "B00AEFXESQ", "B000JMK6LW", "B00004Y6Q5", "B000FVQLQQ", "B000BYA5G4", "B00005JKJA", "B00005JKM2", "B0029LHW68", "B000BBOUUE", "B004FQX5B6", "B000PAAJZ6", "B000N3SU92", "B003YKYX9M", "B00AEBB8O2", "B00007AJF8", "B00A2H9QN8", "B0009WFEDC", "B00GUO2SKA", "B00013RC2K", "B000A7Q2DM", "B00003CXWV", "0792845803", "B001URA5Y8", "B00195I3O0", "B00006AFUR", "B000063JDE", "B00BMKGZVA", "B00AEBB8NI", "B00112S8RS", "B00177YA6U", "0767837398", "B000O76ZQC", "B0052ADP6Y", "B000J10F8C", "B000E6ESU8", "B00009OOFH", "B00005JLRE", "B0059GVBHG", "0767824954", "B00005JLWN", "B00E8G5GU6", "B000QXDCLA", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00004ZETA", "B00AEBB9CS", "B000021Y77", "B00011CZRE", "B002VECM4A", "B00003CXKS", "B006KH6CF4", "B000K7VHQE", "6305127654", "B00AFEXRME", "B004SIP7ZS", "B00020HB32"], "bought_together": ["B0057ZAA6W", "B00005JM23"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005JMJG", "B000MEYKD2", "B0057ZAA6W", "B00005JPAR"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 222264}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 15.36, "brand": "", "asin": "B00003CXP1", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/519CB9K0QML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut"}
{"description": "The second theatrical film from the popular television show is better than the original surprise hit. Instead of delving into their rich fantasy life, the Rugrats gang goes on a real adventure when their families visit Paris together. Mr. Pickles is brought over to fix his giant Reptar robot, the centerpiece of EuroReptarland (a biting version of the trouble-plagued EuroDisney). The underlying story has Chuckie (the one with the square glasses) looking for a new mommy, as his dad (who has a square personality) starts to fall for a villainous executive (voiced by Susan Sarandon). Soon Paris takes it on the chin as the diaper gang tries to save Chuckie's dad from the altar. The success of the Rugrats is in the writing, where much thought goes into finding comic gems for the adults (there are wonderful parodies ofThe GodfatherandKing Kongthat will sail over kids' heads). The garble-mouthed youngsters keep up their joyful ways in this 78-minute feature that feels no different from their Nickelodeon series except in length, some 3-D animation sequences, and an eclectic song score (with Cyndi Lauper's \"I Want a Mom That Will Last Forever\" the real catch).

{"description": "With parents who were actors, it comes as no surprise that the young Joe Yule Jr. made his debut on the stage at the age of only 15 months. He became part of the family act. He became well known for a series of some 50 silent comedies between 1927 and 1933 in which he played Mickey McGuire, a comic-strip character. In 1934 he was signed to MGM. At Mrs. Lawlor's School for Professional Children he first met Judy Garland , whom he would play against in several movies in the future, including some of the 15 &#34;&#34;Andy Hardy&#34;&#34; films. He gave a memorable performance as Puck on loan in Warner Brothers' prestigious flop A Midsummer Night's Dream (1935). With movies like The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1939) and National Velvet (1944) he reached the peak of his career during WWII. He was drafted during the war, and when he returned to Hollywood his fame and box-office draw had significantly decreased. Just like other child stars, he found it difficult to get a break as an adult actor. After Summer Holiday (1948) his career went downhill and the 1950s and 60's for him became a string of not-so-successful movies with a smattering of notable performances in supporting roles in a few hits (The Bridges at Toko-Ri (1954), the Rod Serling-scripted drama Requiem for a Heavyweight (1962) and the frenetic It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World (1963)). The downward spiral of his career coincides with the decline of his former studio, MGM, which was near-mortally wounded by the Supreme Court's 1948 anti-trust decision concerning theater ownership leading to the ultimate collapse of the studio star system, which Rooney was a part of. Out of his long MGM contract by 1949, he turned increasingly to the one-eyed monster for employment. He got his own short lived TV show, &#34;&#34;The Mickey Rooney Show&#34;&#34; (1954) and toured nightclubs and theaters again in the 1960s. Rooney experienced a career renaissance of sorts in 1979 on with _The Black Stallion (1979) (again in a supporting role) and on stage, with the dropped pants burlesque hit &#34;&#34;Sugar Babies&#34;&#34; which ran for 1208 performances on Broadway. He took the play on the road for 3 years afterward where he packed houses across the U.S. (Joey Bishop and Eddie Bracken filled him for him during his 3 contractual vacations). In 1983, following 60 years as an actor, he received the &#34;&#34;Lifetime Achievement&#34;&#34; Oscar.&#34;&#34; Rooney, now well into his 80's, has been surprisingly active and has found himself far more in demand that he was 30 years ago, recently seen to good advantage in the hit Night at the Museum (2006).", "related": {"also_bought": ["B009X919UE", "B00457ZNS8", "B00KIZY3XW", "B00KIZYDCI", "B0024FAG6W", "B00FPUN21O", "B00H7BJ128", "B00C3ALM02", "B000BVNS84", "B00AQ6J5YA", "B00IYJFB2G", "B0002HOERG", "B00008G8WL", "B00K6D1QV8", "B00004XPPK", "B0006FFR9S", "B000062XG3", "B00007ELD1", "B00CVB6XF2", "B00D09AXUA", "B0089LT7ZG", "B00E21D9ME", "B008BSM1CI", "B00AEFXRWO", "6305770328", "B000RXVND8", "B001TITGCA", "B00AB2NX4M", "B0071EKL98", "B000CNE088", "B000PKG6OE", "B0026ZQJT8", "B0024FAG8A", "B00DOZNGC2", "B00023P4GA", "B004LB5FEA", "B0026ZQJP2", "B000CNE08I", "B000CEXGDC", "B00B27WPS0", "B00005UQ8G", "B001SMC9L2", "B004C2523M", "B00J2CB9BQ", "B000MTEFX2", "B00000F17E", "B0008JGQN8", "B006X0ZN3K", "B0009X766O", "B000BGH2HC", "B00EL6A9CI", "B003YY2886", "B00011D1H2", "B00AB2NX1K", "B003F10EO8", "B00I095JAY", "B000CNE08S", "B0080JG2GE", "B000B8384Q", "B000TLTCT0", "B003WLN0SS", "B0000549B1", "B00CN70WS8", "B00E18QK9W", "B001CC7PLW", "B000B83846", "B0000CNY2I", "B000A2WJBQ", "B004CZZZUY", "B0024FAG80", "B0000C2IVE", "B0080JG2LE", "B000063UR0", "B000063UQP", "B009OE2NZI", "B00006II5I", "B00B27WRJM", "B00B27WTBI", "B000K7VHMI", "B002YNQEFG", "B000OHZJGO", "B000KJTGFG", "B000FKO3VC", "B001D5DQHK", "B003ZEQMH8", "B000098ZT0", "B00ALTQRUC", "B00DZP1C9K", "B001PT6YGY", "B0002W4U02", "B000FFJYAW", "B00CDX0TE4", "B000KJTGC4", "B00104AYL0", "B002ZG8PY0", "B000641ZPO", "B005KR6O08", "B0006IUDVC", "B0000714AL", "6305636435"], "bought_together": ["B009X919UE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005F265FW", "B000B5XOYS", "B0026ZQJT8", "B0008ENID4"]}, "price": 13.86, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 173679}, "asin": "B00004Z4VF", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51l1MWo52tL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Quicksand"}
{"description": "If you've seenScreamandI Know What You Did Last Summer, then you know the entire plot ofScary Movie. That's okay, though, because this is a parody, and it helps to know the story in order to be able to get the jokes. No, the biggest surprise here is not the  story as much as the amount of full-frontal male nudity. Really, in addition to all the dick jokes (and the ass jokes and fart jokes), there's a couple of shots of the male member, one of which is erect and used as a weapon.Scary Moviesomehow ended up with an R rating, which in a sense is groundbreaking; perhaps our ratings board is loosening up after all.But is it funny? That's the most important question, and the answer to that is yes. In the vein ofAirplane!, with a dash of the Farrelly brothers,Scary Moviekeeps throwing jokes at you one after another. The law of averages says some of them have to hit, and enough of them do to keep the movie entertaining. Unlike the makers ofAirplane!, however, the Wayans brothers aren't making this movie out of a love of the genre, and unlike the Farrelly brothers, they don't make fun of retarded people with any sort of respect, so the humor throughout feels a lot uglier. Still, there are enough funny scenes inScary Movieto make the viewing experience worthwhile.

{"description": "\"It is hard to imagine a more beautiful movie\" (Time) than this critically acclaimed chronicle of hippie life during the late 1960s, which garnered the acclaimed director of Bonnie and Clyde his second Oscar(r) nomination*. Based on the song by folk music troubadour Arlo Guthrie, son of legendary \"Dust Bowl\" balladeer Woody Guthrie, this tribute film to \"the lost generation\" features memorable scenes with other folk artists like Pete Seeger, who join Arlo in song to make a profound statement about war, protest and change.  In the late '60s, a changing social and political climate inspired a new generation to create a lifestyle outside of the mainstream. Twenty-two year-old Arlo's journey to find a place for himself and his music includes a visit to his dying father in the hospital, gigs in New York and romps with his friends Alice and Ray, who run a small restaurant in Stockbridge, Massachusetts. And when an incident at Alice's Restaurant plays a pivotal role inArlo's avoidance of the draft, it sends him down a road that he will consider a small price to pay to keep his freedom and his beliefs.   *Arthur Penn: Director; Alice's Restaurant (1969); Bonnie and Clyde (1967)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000002KOA", "B000R7I3IW", "B000022TSY", "B0000030N3", "B0007R4T3A", "B003H070N0", "B000VNMSAQ", "B00005V9HL", "B001NXDSLQ", "B004QPHBCA", "B0000030N5", "B00ECW9UJY", "B0024FAG6M", "B00005V9HI", "B0091JJ278", "B000NRRWOM", "039440100X", "0810883317", "B00D9BNOKK", "0792841638", "B000001DJY", "B001UHKPHU", "B0001ZMXGI", "B00A33J884", "B00AZ0YWQS", "B00H96KG2U", "B000ALM4MQ", "B000059HAN", "B0006J27XS", "B0009X75O2", "B000006YEQ", "B00000E7FE", "B00H9L26AA", "B0000AUHQ6", "B00BJB2GSS", "B000EBD9TE", "B0045HCJJE", "B00005J75F", "B00441GYP6", "B000055Y0X", "B000G6BLQU", "B00006D295", "B0002V7ON8", "B0007ZEOPK", "B0000542D2", "B000286RNE", "0792833287", "B00007G1WH", "B002QH2NUA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000002KOA", "B000R7I3IW", "B003H070N0", "B004QPHBCA"]}, "price": 7.98, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 113831}, "asin": "B000053VAR", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51WSP3MQDYL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Alice's Restaurant"}

{"description": "This three-part OAV adventure picks up one year after the conclusion of theGundam Wingseries. Earth and the Space Colonies have joined to form the Earth Sphere Unified Nation; after a brief reign as Queen of Earth, Relena Peacecraft/Darlian has abdicated and is serving as a government minister. The giant Gundams (the large, robotic armor suits) have been hidden or sent hurtling into the sun. This fragile peace is shattered when the sinister Dekim Barton initiates a revolt to make Mariemeia, the daughter of former Oz chief Treize Khushrenada, absolute ruler of the new world-state. She describes the change as part of History's Endless Waltz of \"peace, war, and revolution.\" If Earth refuses to accept the new regime, Barton will crash one of the orbiting colonies into the planet's surface. Only the Gundam pilots can resolve this crisis--with a little help from their friends and former enemies; writer Katsuyuki Sumisawa uses the lulls in the action to explore their early lives in flashbacks. This special-edition DVD includes both the three-part OAV series and the compilation feature, which contains about eight minutes of additional animation.

{"description": "Following the success ofThe Sound of Music, director  Robert Wise chose to film Robert McKenna's prize-winning 1962 novel,The Sand Pebbles--an ambitious choice for a director at the peak  of his career. Shot in Taiwan and Hong Kong, the film combines  historical sweep and intimate human drama in several parallel stories,  all revolving around U.S. Navy machinist's mate Jake Holman (Steve  McQueen). Holman is a skillful but fiercely independent sailor who  joins the \"sand pebble\" crew of the U.S.S. San Pablo, a Navy gunboat  patrolling the Yangtze River on the eve of the Chinese revolution in  1926. The San Pablo's inexperienced captain (Richard Crenna)  obsessively defends the Navy's mission--however unnecessary or  unwanted--to protect American missionaries and businessmen, blind to  the more dangerous implications of American involvement with China's  opposing political factions.Holman is a defiant voice of humanity in this clash between outmoded  values and inevitable change; his final line of dialogue (\"What the  hell happened?\") is a tragic summation of misguided policy, expressing  the film's criticism of the Vietnam War. Rather than preach, however,  Wise lets McKenna's potent drama emerge from finely-drawn  relationships--between Holman and a young American teacher (19-year-old  Candice Bergen, in her second film); between Holman and the Chinese  \"coolie\" (Mako) whose heartbreaking fate transcends all issues of  racial or political difference; and between crewmate \"Frenchy\" Burgoyne  (Richard Attenborough) and the Chinese woman he's sworn to love and  protect at all costs. Combined with the film's colorful supporting  cast, adventurous scope, and climactic battle scenes, these personal  dynamics bring substance and spirit to a complex story of good  intentions gone awry.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0008ENHUI", "B00AEFY9YY", "0792838408", "B00AEFYPHA", "B00005ASGB", "B0009HKH6Q", "B0008ENHUS", "B00407PNY2", "B00108FMFO", "B00008R9M6", "B0008ENHTO", "B000B5IPEC", "B00004XPPC", "B000A2WJBQ", "B00AEFXLKC", "B003PIUII8", "B002AO7QBA", "B004R6JG7Q", "B0008ENHV2", "B0008ENHTY", "B0008KLV9G", "B0001A9I52", "B000O78L0U", "B0007TKNM4", "B000FZETR0", "B0001GF2JC", "B000NQRR34", "B0008ENHU8", "B000059TFW", "B00008AOTO", "B00008PC13", "B000MGTQ7K", "B0000EYUCK", "1557504466", "B00AEFXD1O", "B000EHSVS2", "B0001FGC1U", "B00AEBB8W4", "B000MGTQ7U", "B0007TKNGA", "B0045HCIZE", "B0000AMRUP", "B000NTPG6Q", "B0001NBMHQ", "B00005PJ8L", "B000062XF0", "B0001WTWWE", "B0007MAO0C", "B00AEFYBA6", "B00005N5S3", "B00BL9NQ00", "B002DH20PQ", "B00096S4B2", "B00005QCVP", "B0015S2OWI", "B0042RJWTM", "B000EHSVOG", "0792841662", "B003AWRMCO", "B0007TKNLA", "B007N31YH0", "B00005R23T", "B000EHSVSC", "B00005JKF6", "B000CNESN0", "B00008DDGW", "B00005PJ8S", "B000E5N6KW", "B0001NBMIA", "B000MRA542", "0792844017", "B00008AOTR", "B0001NBMH6", "B000AQ6A0I", "0899668577", "B0006B2A42", "B00005OSJQ", "B0024FADC4", "B00066FBQG", "B00083FZFY", "B000QRI1GW", "B003ASLJPE", "B0019UGYK0", "B00143XE0U", "B000AQKU72", "B0009UVCR6", "B0002TSZHY", "079284646X", "B0001NBMGC", "B00CHYSSME", "B000HWZ4CA", "B00595W3QK", "B00006ADD5", "B00003CXB5", "B008SAPC7K", "B00008V6Y1", "B0066E6RD8", "B000O599VM", "B000062XEX", "B0001FVDIC"], "bought_together": ["B0008ENHUI", "0792838408"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00J4BW0SQ", "B007PM207W", "B0008ENHTO", "B000059TFW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 79827}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 13.4, "brand": "", "asin": "B000059HAF", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515ETM1B74L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Sand Pebbles"}
{"description": "Antoine Fuqua (THE REPLACEMENT KILLERS, BAIT) turns up the intensity level with TRAINING DAY, a charged drama about police corruption in downtown Los Angeles. Ethan Hawke stars as Jake Hoyt, a well-intentioned young officer who thinks he's found his ticket to becoming a detective in the form of undercover officer Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington). Harris is a notorious figure in the streets and in the office. He also has the authority to make Jake's professional wishes come true, provided Jake is able to prove his worth on Alonzo's team. At first, Alonzo's blunt, carefree demeanor provides a shock to Jake's optimistic system, but as it becomes clear that Alonzo is dangerously out of control, Jake must decide whether or not to risk his future in the name of the law.\n\nWashington's performance as the evil, pragmatic detective is a sight to behold. He delivers his lines with a devilish ferocity that keeps the film bubbling throughout. Hawke slips into the role of the rookie everyman with ease, providing a good contrast to Washington's fiery presence. Former video director Fuqua completes the picture by casting musicians Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre, and Macy Gray in supporting roles.", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792841778", "630268644X", "6303012140", "6300214826"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 428216}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.0, "brand": "", "asin": "B00005JKEC", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/415AYTB1GNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Training Day [VHS]"}

{"description": "A Beautiful Mindmanages to twist enough pathos out of John Nash's incredible life story to redeem an at-times goofy portrayal of schizophrenia. Russell Crowe tackles the role with characteristic fervor, playing the Nobel prize-winning mathematician from his days at Princeton, where he developed a groundbreaking economic theory, to his meteoric rise to the cover ofForbesmagazine and an MIT professorship, and on through to his eventual dismissal due to schizophrenic delusions. Of course, it is the delusions that fascinate director Ron Howard and, predictably, go astray. Nash's other world, populated as it is by a maniacal Department of Defense agent (Ed Harris), an imagined college roommate who seems straight out ofDead Poets Society, and an orphaned girl, is so fluid and scriptlike as to make the viewer wonder if schizophrenia is really as slick as depicted. Crowe's physical intensity drags us along as he works admirably to carry the film on his considerable shoulders.

The bonus features are much more generous than the offerings on previousStar Trektheatrical films other than the two-disc special editions.  There are four featurettes (46 minutes total) discussing the casting of Shinzon, development of the story line, shooting the action scenes, and the themes of family and change that run through the film.  Director Stuart Baird contributes a commentary track that is a bit dry and sometimes silent.  He mentions how he's not aTrekinsider and that because he was working in an established setting he didn't have the freedom of creation that directors usually do.  He also discusses the mechanics of shooting and points out where certain scenes were shortened or eliminated.  Seven of the cut scenes appear on the DVD, some introduced by Baird or Patrick Stewart.

{"description": "Outstanding picture and sound plus tons of features makeCharlie's Angels: Full Throttlea fully loaded DVD.  Don't expect more T&A; in the unrated edition, however.  The only difference is glimpses of more intense violence in a few of the fight scenes.  For example, in the theatrical version you'll see an angel flying through the air, but in the unrated version you'll then see her lying expressionless on the ground.  Also, blood flies out of Drew Barrymore's mouth in one scene.  On his commentary track, director McG discusses inside jokes, visual effects, and shots that didn't quite work for him.  Like a TV sportscaster, he uses a telestrator, but only to occasionally circle items of interest or draw arrows.  There's also an amusing commentary track by the three writers, who chuckle over inside jokes and discuss how the film was changed from the original script.  They preface their comments with: \"I guess they asked us to do this just to prove that writers worked on this movie.\"  \"Who are we kidding?  Who's listening to this right now?\"If you want still more info, there's a trivia track with pop-up factoids with occasional links to more featurettes, a jukebox that offers clips of 11 songs and explanations of why they were picked, a cameo-graphy that offers clips of 13 personalities and why we should know them, and eight 4- to 18-minute featurettes exploring such topics as stunts, vehicles, costumes, and the Pussycat Dolls dance troupe.

The story finds Earth's post-World War III humankind in a state of severe emotional repression: If no one feels anything, no one will be inspired by dark passions to attack their neighbors. Writer-director Kurt Wimmer's monochromatic,Metropolis-influenced cityscape provides an excellent backdrop to the heavy-handed mission of John Preston (Christian Bale), a top cop who busts \"sense offenders\" and crushes sentimental, sensual, and artistic relics from a bygone era. Predictably, Preston becomes intrigued by his victims and that which they die to cherish; he stops taking his mandatory, mood-flattening drug and is even aroused by a doomed prisoner (Emily Watson). Wimmer's wrongheaded martial arts/dueling guns motif is sheer silliness (a battle over a puppy doesn't help), butEquilibriumshould be seen for Bale's moving performance as a man shocked back to human feeling.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00006JDVV", "B000LC55F2", "B000FS9FCG", "B0009A40ES", "B000KX0IM2", "B0007Y08QA", "B00AEFYCW8", "0767805712", "B00005JL78", "B0018O4YT0", "B001FB55HQ", "B00003CXZ4", "B00AEFXCLU", "B000FGGE68", "B000WMA6R8", "B002ZG980U", "B003XURDAY", "B00HOGBXS6", "B00005JPAR", "B000GFLKF8", "B00K2CHX9C", "B00AEFXW8I", "B000XR9L50", "B004XQO90O", "B000N6TX1I", "B000FKO5QK", "B004SIP9Z6", "B007WZTMCI", "B0007DFJ0G", "B000093FLA", "B0073U2FB2", "0783225814", "B000K7VHQ4", "B001OQCVI8", "B00011CZRE", "B000P0J0AQ", "B00000JSJC", "B0000AXE8I", "B008JFUQZ2", "B007X4ECMI", "B002ZG97CO", "B00AZMFJYA", "B008JFUO36", "B004P2VQZC", "B0000AC8LR", "B0045HCJT4", "B00J5LXT6M", "B00AEFY5B6", "B002UZCJ8Y", "B001GZ6QC4", "B00177Y9ZC", "B003UESJHO", "B000XA5K48", "B001DJLD1M", "B008JFUN50", "B005LAIHXQ", "B00K7IPFSM", "B0006IIPIK", "B005LAII8A", "B0013PSTMC", "B008JFUNHI", "B001L57ZYM", "B002QEHPQU", "B0034G4ORC", "B004SIP95G", "0767802519", "B001TOD92C", "B008JFUS0U", "B000087F6L", "B0051MKNV8", "B007WXUVHU", "B005LAIH2C", "B000R9U3B0", "B004LWZW7E", "B000MZHW40", "B00005JNJV", "B00005JPD0", "B000GGSMC6", "B0000ACOXL", "B0085A9HU6", "B009YQJ322", "B003Y5H5GK", "B009MO57H6", "B004LWZW4M", "0800195175", "B002QW7ALM", "B00005JMA8", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B001EAWMGA", "B002O3Z4WU", "B000BW7QWW", "B001GUYB08", "B00005V9HH", "B001UV4XWY", "B00A8MGIZG", "B002GSXKNI", "B00IARA8KM", "B004LWZWGA", "B00005JA8B", "B001QTXM5Y"], "bought_together": ["B000LC55F2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0007Y08QA", "B006ZL1PGG", "B000LC55F2", "B004P7CMJG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 61424}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.34, "brand": "Dimension", "asin": "B00005JLWN", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51K2WVH130L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Equilibrium"}
{"description": "A choppy, unsettling meditation on sexual obsession, Nicholas Roeg'sBad Timingstars Theresa Russell and Art Garfunkel as Milena and Alex, two lovers pursuing a torrid relationship in late-1970s Vienna. The movie opens with Milena being rushed to the hospital for an apparent suicide attempt. Alex, a psychology professor, proceeds to play it cool as he's questioned by Inspector Netusil (Harvey Keitel). As Milena fights for her life on the operating table, the story of how she and Alex came together is revealed in startlingly raw passages of lust and bursts of raw emotion. Roeg throws the narrative out of joint with flashbacks and jarring editing, skillfully turning this story of a love affair into a mystery.  The scene in which Milena aggressively seduces Alex on a stairwell is a bravura, gutsy performance from Russell. What's even more startling is the odd casting of this film. After all, thatisthe bare backside of the guy who most famously provided harmonies on \"Scarborough Fair.\" Roeg, clearly enamored with casting musicians in lead roles (David Bowie inThe Man Who Fell to Earthand Mick Jagger inPerformance) also approaches the editing of the film as though it were music, with abrupt, discordant cuts and strange juxtapositions. The film--of a tradition of sexually frank films like Bertolucci'sLast Tango in Paris--is yet another reminder of how deeply filmmakers of the '70s were willing to mine human emotions, especially unpleasant ones.-- Ryan Boudinot", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000KCI92E", "B00009Y3N8", "B004S8021W", "B000069I0A", "B00L3ZB7PS", "B00L3ZB7JO", "B00JVQ7PWU", "B004S8020S", "B00KE3B6NI", "B00JVQ7QTM", "B006M3M5FM", "B00HRISNPM", "B0064SVNHG", "B00013RC66", "B00HE011DE", "B001PYD0L6", "B001TIQT6G", "B00393SG3S", "B0007GAG42", "B001CW7ZT4", "0780022823", "B000CBG5PG", "B00HVOFP6W", "B004CIIXDC", "B0000VLLHK", "B00K0MM4AM", "B00GPPXOTS", "B00004W3HG", "B0052YDMZE", "B00GPPXP6A", "B0007P0X9G", "B000QXDFRG", "B00GMV8L1Q", "B005152C78", "B00F8PTALC", "B0002KPHZG", "B00IGK6TH4", "B00005UQ7Q", "B00HT2RTU6", "B000002P6S", "B00IY1T8T6", "B00GPPXNIK", "B0007989Y8", "B0009298N4", "B001BSBBJE", "B001LMU19G", "B00005BHW6", "B003VA3JTA", "B00IO9J5XW", "B006OB3K56", "B00J2PQZRQ", "B008CB8CJK", "B000BC8SWO", "B000C8Q8ZQ", "B0009VRHLK", "B00FUABJJQ", "0783230559", "B00012L786", "B00005AUKD", "B00F98FOI6", "B00317LM9W", "B00J4LMHMK", "B00F98FOFY", "6305899681", "B000GRU8TK", "B001GCATWK", "B00H96KG2U", "B008Y5OWSO", "B00009ME9Z", "B00JJ3EHCG", "B000XQ4HQO", "B0048LPRCS", "B0012Z363A", "B003KGBISE", "B000I8OOG0", "B000C8Q900", "B001CW7ZSU", "B00DZP1BUU", "B004WPYO3I", "B004WPYO6U", "B000OPPAEM", "B003UM8T3A", "B00005V6N6", "B00007L4I8", "B000AYELEC", "B00018D40O", "B00EMAGKNU", "B0002V7O10", "B00GPPXNQ2", "B00005QAPJ", "B009RWRIMA", "B001PYD0KM", "B00005LPZW", "B00005JP4N", "B006TTC5MM", "B005ND87L8", "B00J2PQZEY", "B00HT2L7VS"], "bought_together": ["B000KCI92E"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000KCI92E", "B00009Y3N8", "B00GPPXNIK", "B0016I0AKU"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 60014}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 19.36, "brand": "Image Entertainment", "asin": "B00005JMVQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5146YWTK1SL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Bad Timing (The Criterion Collection)"}
{"description": "WithInfernal Affairs, Hong Kong filmmakers Wai Keung Lau and Siu Fai Mak have successfully taken a smart script and a great cast, added some stylistic cinematography, and dual-fistedly given a new twist to a formulaic genre.  Lau Kin Ming (Andy Lau), a young, loyal gangster, is ordered by his Triad boss Sam (Eric Tsang) to join the police force. While on the inside the young mole can keep a close eye on police activity, ensuring the gang's activities will not be interrupted. Police Superintendent Wong (Anthony Wong Chau-Sang) has a similar plan. He takes a bright, ambitious police cadet Yan (Tony Leung Chiu Wai) and makes him an undercover cop with plans to get him inside the Triads.  Years pass and both are now deep into their assigned roles. Undercover cop Yan, more or less living the life of a gangster, is now a member of Boss Sam's group, and \"Officer\" Lau has all the appearance of a good cop trying to bust up the Triads' drug ring. During a bust that could finally bring down Boss Sam, the moles inadvertently become aware of each other's existence, and each is left wondering who is on the inside. What follows is a unique and exciting twist on the classic cat and mouse chase in which each man is not fighting for his life, but for his anonymity. In addition to its plot twists, what liftsInfernal Affairsabove the standard cop story is its subtle exploration of the relative nature of good and evil. Part action, part psychological examination,Infernal Affairsis a sharp and fresh take on the classic crime story, and the inspiration for a 2006 Martin Scorsese remake (The Departed).

{"description": "There's something in this house...Something ancient and dark that remains still, hidden and silent. It can only wait, having been concealed in the shadows for years. In fact, its milieu is darkness. Only in it can it show itself and move. It even takes its name: DARKNESS. It's lived here since someone tried to call it, more than forty years ago. Because this house hides a secret, a terrible past, an inconceivably evil act. Seven children, faceless people, a circle that must be completed. And blood, lots of blood... But something went wrong. One of the children got away. The circle wasn't completed. That's why what lives here isn't finished. It's just waiting...It tries to carry out what it couldn't before, making plans in the shadows, to become complete, to be, to exist. A new family has just moved into the house. A small child. An unstable father capable of losing his temper at any time. A perfect target. The right place at the right time. The pieces only have to be put in place. And then wait. Maybe the family's daughter will be able to discover the truth; the dark secret of the past, the sinister conspiracy, the truth about what threatens them. Why is the father getting worse? What is her little brother afraid of? Why doesn't her mother listen to her? And why do the lights keep going out? It could be that nothing happens by chance, that everything has been worked out from the start. A devilish plan, precise and exact like a time-bomb. Her father's illness, the house, the circles, the children. Perhaps she can foresee darkness' master stroke of play and the inevitable destiny that is closing in on her family. But maybe it's too late....", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0013FZUP6", "B00EZ50SGW", "0783237413", "B00015HX5O", "B00008LUNW", "B00BEIYG98", "B004P7CN3G", "B001U0HBQA", "B000ECXWW2", "B00AJLHUA8", "B00BEIYMAG", "B00000K31T", "B00IKM5LXG", "B000OVLBGM", "B0021L8UFI", "B00005JOWW", "B004SUDQ4A", "B006QWC2ZC", "B00B96TGQS", "B00441GYTC", "B00003CWRF", "B0002H3S78", "B0006SGYL0", "B000TXNDT8", "B000HC2LFI", "B0010X740A", "B001NFNFNU", "B00DPUB5EW", "B008VPCL7G", "B0031U8OEK", "B00005UM2X", "B00AEFYCW8", "B002ZG98LO", "B002GHHHL0", "B003VA3JUO", "B00AIBZLVY", "B00AEFYSR2", "B000AWYOGE", "B004SUDQ04", "6305428271", "B000NQRR1Q", "B0097C046W", "B00005JMET", "B001KKU9CI", "B000PMLJMQ", "B004LWZW24", "B007CZ3E7C", "B003LR5BDK", "B003AWRMC4", "B003Y5H54W", "1573625779", "B003IWYWC4", "B000RGN2JI", "B000OCY7TY", "B001UV4X8S", "B0006SSOHC", "B002ZG971U", "B009XTF8KQ", "B00003CXWM", "B0067QPVJ6", "B005TK23PQ", "B0009X763M", "B000FFJZO2", "B004EPYZT4", "B0000AUHOK", "B003Y5H4SO", "B0002C4JJ4", "B000069I1I", "B00005UQ9W", "B000GCFO0I", "B005LAIGOQ", "B002LMSWN2", "B005LAIIRQ", "B004SIP95G", "B001QOGYAO", "B008JFUNYG", "B00003CWOL", "B00005JL3T", "B000ASATZ8", "B000ION22G", "6305908087", "B000ARTMT8"], "bought_together": ["B0013FZUP6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B008D1RCZY", "B004P7CN7W", "B007AFC236", "B000AA4JL6"]}, "price": 15.47, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 95491}, "asin": "B00005JNBN", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41C8GH93EFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Darkness (Unrated Version)"}

{"description": "Batman Beginsdiscards the previous four films in the series and recasts the Caped Crusader as a fearsome avenging angel. That's good news, because the series, which had gotten off to a rousing start under Tim Burton, had gradually dissolved into self-parody by 1997'sBatman & Robin. As the title implies,Batman Beginstells the story anew, when Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) flees Western civilization following the murder of his parents. He is taken in by a mysterious instructor named Ducard (Liam Neeson in another mentor role) and urged to become a ninja in the League of Shadows, but he instead returns to his native Gotham City resolved to end the mob rule that is strangling it. But are there forces even more sinister at hand?Cowritten by the team of David S. Goyer (a veteran comic book writer) and director Christopher Nolan (Memento),Batman Beginsis a welcome return to the grim and gritty version of the Dark Knight, owing a great debt to the graphic novels that preceded it. It doesn't have the razzle dazzle, or the mass appeal, ofSpider-Man 2(though the Batmobile is cool), and retelling the origin means it starts slowly, like most \"first\" superhero movies. But it's certainly the best Bat-film since Burton's original, and one of the best superhero movies of its time. Bale cuts a good figure as Batman, intense and dangerous but with some of the lightheartedness Michael Keaton brought to the character. Michael Caine provides much of the film's humor as the family butler, Alfred, and as the love interest, Katie Holmes (Dawson's Creek) is surprisingly believable in her first adult role. Also featuring Gary Oldman as the young police officer Jim Gordon, Morgan Freeman as a Q-like gadgets expert, and Cillian Murphy as the vile Jonathan Crane.--David HoriuchiBatmanat Amazon.comAllBatmanDVDsBatman Begins101: A Comic Book PrimerWhere Have I Seen Christian Bale?AllBatmanComics and Graphic NovelsBatmanToysBatman BeginsSoundtrackStills fromBatman Begins(click for larger images)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001GZ6QC4", "B004LWZWGA", "B002GSXKN8", "B000P0J06U", "B001OST0LW", "B000P0J06K", "B004EPZ07K", "B00E5I2MCM", "B00005JKCH", "B001GCUO1Q", "B002ZG980U", "B001OST0M6", "B008JFUPFI", "B004LWZWFQ", "B00005JMQW", "B004LWZW42", "B000VI70QS", "B001DHXT20", "B000M341QE", "B0000959N0", "B000UR9T8C", "B00005JNTU", "B000AYELVA", "B00E5I2M6I", "B002IPFWTE", "B000HEVZ9E", "B0090SI56Y", "B002HWRYJE", "B0006L0LOS", "B000OVLBF8", "B00003CWT6", "B000VR0570", "B00E5I2MEK", "B000HCO83Q", "B0007P0Y7C", "B008JFUO72", "B00F4FFO8E", "B001CDR1FG", "B000P0J0EW", "B002T9H2LA", "B0002KVUKM", "B00E5I2M9K", "B00005N5S5", "B0083SBMBM", "B0001BKAEY", "B00AQSN7HE", "B000J10EQU", "B00005JKZY", "B002NXSRVG", "B000AYELVU", "B001OQCV6A", "B004LWZW4M", "B001VLBDD0", "B001GZ6QEC", "B004GJYRA0", "B007REV4T8", "B001TK80C0", "B000HRJLII", "B001QTXM5Y", "B005G4TJUC", "B00005JKZV", "B0053FANT0", "B00005JA8B", "B003YAR97K", "B004SIP9Z6", "B00001ZWUS", "B004EPYZQC", "B001N44BVQ", "B006VRRGNK", "B001AEF6HM", "B00000JQB5", "B00011CZRE", "B00AZMFJYA", "B00AEFY0F2", "B007K3JFUQ", "B0002IQMAM", "B00005JN0T", "B002SJIO4A", "B000VWYJ86", "B0013FDM7E", "B00005JNTI", "B00407PNY2", "B00DTPRZ24", "B008JFUS0U", "B00004Z4WR", "B000FS9FCG", "B000QXDED6", "B0085A9HU6", "0780624890", "B00005LOUK", "B000065U1N", "B000P0J0AG", "B00005JN5T", "B001QB9H1U", "B00005JMUA", "0792844890", "B0007DFJ0G", "B004EPYZSK", "B008JFUOWM", "B00AEFY5B6"], "bought_together": ["B001GZ6QC4", "B004LWZWGA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B009JBWOU0", "B001GZ6QC4", "B004LWZWGA", "B002ZG980U"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 7806}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.99, "brand": "DC Comics", "asin": "B00005JNJV", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518zjc4XtzL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Batman Begins (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "Despite super effects, a huge budget, and the cinematic pedigree of alien-happy Steven Spielberg, this take on H.G. Wells's novel is basically a horror film packaged as a sci-fi thrill ride. Instead of a mad slasher, however, Spielberg (along with writers Josh Friedman & David Koepp) utilizes aliens hell-bent on quickly destroying humanity, and the terrifying results that prey upon adult fears, especially in the post-9/11 world. The realistic results could be a new genre, the grim popcorn thriller; often you feel like you're watching Schindler's List more than Spielberg's other thrill-machine movies (Jaws,Jurassic Park). The film centers on Ray Ferrier, a divorced father (Tom Cruise, oh so comfortable) who witnesses one giant craft destroy his New Jersey town and soon is on the road with his teen son (Justin Chatwin) and preteen daughter (Dakota Fanning) in tow, trying to keep ahead of the invasion. The film is, of course, impeccably designed and produced by Spielberg's usual crew of A-class talent. The aliens are genuinely scary, even when the film--like the novel--spends a good chunk of time in a basement. Readers of the book (or viewers of the deft 1953 adaptation) will note the variation of whom and how the aliens come to Earth, which poses some logistical problems. The film opens and closes with narration from the novel read by Morgan Freeman, but Spielberg could have adapted Orson Welles's words from the famous Halloween Eve 1938 radio broadcast: \"We couldn't soap all your windows and steal all your garden gates by tomorrow night, so we did the best next thing: we annihilated the world.\"--Doug ThomasWar of the Worldsat Amazon.comThe SoundtrackThe War of the Worlds(1953)War of the Worlds - The Complete First Season(TV series)Classic Sci-Fi Movies and Their RemakesAliens Invade on DVDThe Prog-rock Opera (no kidding)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEBB8VK", "B00005JL78", "B001SGEUYW", "B00008G8M4", "B00005JL3T", "B0013FDM7E", "B00AEFXNLY", "B00005JMXX", "B001OQCV2E", "B000VECAD0", "B002O3Z510", "B0002V7OI8", "B000H30B2C", "B000EGDB10", "B00005JN2Z", "B005LAIIMG", "B005PTYP70", "B002O3Z50G", "B0002V7ON8", "B00005JN0T", "B00K2CHW48", "B002SJIO4A", "0783225547", "B008JFUO36", "B00005JKLZ", "B00AS1Q93S", "1936594056", "B004EPYZUS", "B001TUZG4K", "B00AEFXR1K", "B00001ZWUS", "B00AEFXYJA", "0767817478", "B0034G4ORC", "B003QO8TOQ", "B00070FX5U", "B0045HCJSA", "B00000G3PA", "B005LAIHPE", "B003Y5H5GK", "B00AEBBA72", "B00003CWU3", "B00I9TDMRM", "B001ECDVKE", "B00003CXXP", "B000V4UFZK", "B0010X73ZG", "B001DZOC6Y", "B00005JKFR", "B000XT1P4S", "B003HKN52U", "B0009PW4D2", "B000HRMAPE", "B004EPYZPS", "B0018QPPXW", "B0002WZTOI", "B00AEBB9LO", "B004LWZW4M", "B003ABZHAO", "B003YJFALS", "B0087ZG7HK", "B000OT6V64", "B004P7CN7W", "B000CCBC9O", "B00000ILDD", "0767803434", "B001L57ZYM", "B000065V3G", "B007STBUHI", "B002ZG980U", "B008JFUQZ2", "B00005B6JZ", "B0006GANOQ", "B000F1IQN2", "1494343576", "B001GCUO02", "B00004Y87O", "0783226810", "B004EPYZSK", "B000P0J0BU", "B005LAIHXQ", "B001680M26", "B000EQHXN2", "B0045HCJFS", "B00004BZIY", "B00008G8M5", "B00003CXQA", "B008JFUS0U", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00EIN6KJ0", "B0000DZ6N3", "B000MV8A9A", "B00005JKYX", "B0000YEEGM", "B000TGJ8CQ", "B0013FCWUW", "B002ZG9864", "B00003CWTI", "B008MIMWQW", "B00IKM5OCO"], "bought_together": ["B00AEBB8VK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AEBB8VK", "B004LWZW4M", "B00005JL78", "B004EPYZSK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 18739}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.95, "brand": "Dreamworks Skg", "asin": "B00005JNTI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51upxzPRnXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "War of the Worlds"}
{"description": "Marvel Comics' first family of superherodom, the Fantastic Four, hits the big screen in a light-hearted and funny adventure.  It begins when down-on-his-luck genius Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd,Horatio Hornblower) has to enlist the financial and intellectual help from former schoolmate and rival Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon,Nip/Tuck) in order to pursue outer-space research into human DNA.  Also on the trip are Reed's best friend, Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis,The Shield); his former lover, Sue Storm (Jessica Alba,Dark Angel,Sin City), who's now Doom's employee and love interest; and her hotshot-pilot brother, Johnny Storm (Chris Evans,Cellular).  Things don't go as planned, of course, and the quartet becomes blessed--or is it cursed?--with superhuman powers: flexibility, brute strength, invisibility and projecting force fields, and bursting into flame.  Meanwhile, Doom himself is undergoing a transformation.Among the many entries in the comic-book-movie frenzy,Fantastic Fouris refreshing because it doesn't take itself too seriously. Characterization isn't too deep, and the action is a bit sparse until the final reel (like most \"first\" superhero movies, it has to go through the \"how did we get these powers and what we will do with them\" churn). But it's a good-looking cast, and original comic-book cocreator Stan Lee makes his most significant Marvel-movie cameo yet, in a speaking role as the FF's steadfast postal carrier, Willie Lumpkin. Newcomers to superhero movies might find the idea of a family with flexibility, strength, invisibility, and force fields a retread ofThe Incredibles, but Pixar's animated film was very much a tribute to the FF and other heroes of the last 40 years. The irony is that whileFantastic Fouris an enjoyable B-grade movie, it's the tribute,The Incredibles, that turned out to be a film for the ages.--David HoriuchiOn the DVDThe principal extra on the DVD is a spirited commentary track by Jessica Alba, Michael Chiklis, and Ioan Gruffud.  Self-avowed FF fan Chiklis explains why the Thing doesn't have a craggy brow, Alba recalls which things were \"cool,\" and they talk about looking forward to the sequel. There are three short deleted scenes (including a goofy Wolverine reference), 20 minutes of barely watchable hand-held video footage from the press tour, music videos, and some short featurettes including an appearance by FF creator Stan Lee.--David HoriuchiThe Fantastic Four at Amazon.comComics and Graphic NovelsDisney animated seriesThe classic comic bookMovie tie-in graphic novelThe Xbox gameFantastic FourSoundtrackThe Fantastic CastJessica Albaas Sue StormMichael Chiklisas The ThingIoan Gruffuddas Reed RichardsChris Evansas Johnny StormStills fromFantastic Four(click for larger images)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000VI70QS", "B0000959N0", "B001DHXT20", "B0007P0Y7C", "B004EPZ07K", "B001CDR1FG", "B00E5I2MEK", "B001GCUO1Q", "B00E5I2M9K", "B00E5I2MCM", "B000OVLBF8", "B00005JMQW", "B008JFUO72", "B004LWZW42", "B00E5I2M6I", "B000UR9T8C", "B0090SI56Y", "B000HEVZ9E", "B000HCO83Q", "B00005JKCH", "B005OY6LBE", "B001OQCVI8", "B008JFUS0U", "B004LWZWFQ", "B000AYELVU", "B0002IQMAM", "B003YAR97K", "B0083SBMBM", "B001QB9H1U", "B001AK3S4Y", "B005LAIGW8", "B000AYELVA", "B001F7MSFM", "B0006L0LOS", "B003H8F3AY", "B008JFUPFI", "B006DHAT5K", "B002GSXKN8", "B002ZG99G8", "B00005JNJV", "B002IPFWTE", "B002NXSRVG", "B000VR0570", "B0006D3HGA", "B004LWZWGA", "B005LAII44", "B000YV1Q2G", "B00F4FFO8E", "B005G4TJUC", "B00005JN0T", "B0007US7CQ", "B00E1HIXEI", "B000J10EQU", "B0002KVUKM", "B000VKL6T8", "B001TK80C0", "B002ZG99B8", "B000Y7U98C", "B002GSXKNI", "B00005JM5B", "B001GZ6QC4", "B000PFUAP0", "B00005JKWJ", "B0009P42WI", "B00174RCHW", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B00005JKYX", "B005TK0MFE", "B000VNMMPW", "B001QTXM5Y", "B000EU1Q7M", "B00008G8M4", "B000P6XQ50", "B00005JN5E", "B0007V6ITE", "B001VLBDD0", "B005LAIH54", "B001FB55HQ", "B000IJ79WU", "B008Y1YK9Y", "B00561BNJK", "B001VLFE7G", "B000CNER1S", "B00K7IPFSM", "B001BP4K22", "B00005JL78", "B0001CNRS4", "B00979KQD6", "B00157OI9Q", "B004EPYZUS", "B002HWRYJE", "B009YQJ322", "B003Y5H5EW", "0780624890", "B001RHGRT8", "B0013J55B6", "B0013BM63O", "B0053FANPY", "B009MO57H6", "078401132X"], "bought_together": ["B000VI70QS", "B001DHXT20"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000VI28Z6", "B000VI70QS", "B008JFUS0U", "B0090SI56Y"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 12162}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.98, "brand": "Twentieth Century Fox", "asin": "B00005JNTU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51AM4R5J04L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Fantastic Four (Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "This two-disc collector's edition ofPirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chestis packed with over five hours of special features that delve into everything from creating the mythology-inspired Davy Jones and Kraken figures, to working and planning without a completed script, the incredible CGI techniques used in the film, the intense sword training sessions and stunt work, and the unpredictability of filming on location in the Caribbean. The audio commentary by writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio is an interesting and insightful look into the finished film, but perhaps even more revealing is the 25-minute \"Charting the Return\" preproduction diary in which everyone from producer Jerry Bruckheimer to associate director Peter Kohn and writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio give a sense of the enormity of the project of concurrently writing and filming two sequels toPirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl. The overwhelming logistics of planning and casting without a finished script, scouting and preparing remote locations, constructing a new Black Pearl, and functional props like the rolling water wheel, and cutting costs to stay within budget are nothing less than mind-boggling. In the hourlong \"According to Plan\" feature, director Gore Verbinski, producer Jerry Bruckheimer, and a host of others detail the enormity of the project, focusing on the stamina involved in a 200-day shooting schedule and the need for adaptability and flexibility in dealing with everything from behind schedule excavations to the logistics of shooting on moving water and even the natural fury of a full-blown hurricane.  Shorter featurettes \"Meet Davy Jones: Anatomy of a Legend\" and \"Creating the Kraken\" focus on the mythological creatures in the film and the awesome visual effects and advances in CGI technology that made them possible.  \"Mastering the Blade\" follows Orlando Bloom (Will Turner), Keira Knightley (Elizabeth Swann), and Jack Davenport (Norrington) through some intense sword-fighting training sessions and \"Fly on the Set: The Bone Cage\" offers a frightening look at what it was like to shoot the bone cage scene of the movie.  Other bonus features include bloopers, an interactive tour of Johnny Depp's special makeup effects and wardrobe details, a look at how the 1967 Disney Land Pirates of the Caribbean ride was recently \"re-imagineered\" to incorporate some of the characters and elements from the new movies, producer Jerry Bruckheimer's photo diary, and a glimpse of the glitzy June 24, 2006 red carpet premiere on Disney Land's main street.--Tami Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000U7WV1Y", "B00005JM5E", "B005COPWZW", "B004A8ZWUQ", "B0013BM63O", "B00005JN5E", "B004M1A21K", "B004DTLK80", "B000VR0570", "B00005JKZV", "B00005JKZY", "B00005JKCH", "B001HN694K", "B00005JPH2", "B00AEFYGBA", "B00BEZTMFY", "B001HQZJMU", "B00E5I2M6I", "B006VRRGNK", "B001BEK8HO", "B000E8M0VA", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B001E75QH0", "B008QE9XD2", "B00E5I2MCM", "B00LG6YEKE", "B00AEBBA72", "B007K3JFUQ", "B000HRMAPE", "B0090SI56Y", "B000E6EK2Y", "B0053FANRC", "B00005JMQW", "B008Y1YK9Y", "B00177YA1K", "B001TK80C0", "B000UR9T8C", "B00003CXI1", "B004EPYZUS", "B00003CXTA", "B001OQCV6A", "B0014Z4ON4", "B005G4TJUC", "B000F7CECK", "B00HFFE8HE", "B001GCUO1Q", "B0087ZG7J8", "B003YAR97K", "B008JFUNTG", "B001GCUO0W", "B000NIBURQ", "B0053FANPY", "B00023B1LC", "B003QO8TOQ", "B002VPE1BQ", "B00F84H73Q", "B003Y5H54W", "B00003CWT6", "B00007AJGH", "B00E5I2M9K", "B000W7F5SS", "B0049IHX2C", "B00000IRE6", "B001F7MSFM", "B000AYELVA", "B002ZG9904", "B000VWYJ86", "B00CFA222M", "B003UYUQZW", "B008UZ949K", "B0002KVUKM", "B000209KMW", "B000UVKGPI", "B0087ZG7HK", "B0000WN140", "B001EZE5BU", "B002PMV9FG", "B000HT386M", "B000NQRR1Q", "B00003CXZ1", "630529142X", "B0002ZDVEU", "B004A8ZWSS", "B00005JM5B", "B000BTITKS", "B00E5I2MEK", "B002HWRYJE", "B001GZ6QC4", "B000W796OM", "B00AQSN7HE", "B0046BI81W", "B001VLBDD0", "B0060FXDCG", "B0084IG8TM", "B005OCFGTO", "B000OLGCIE", "B008JFUS0U", "B00007AJG4", "B009JBWOU0", "B001B3LIOC"], "bought_together": ["B000U7WV1Y", "B00005JM5E"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005COPWZW", "B00005JM5E", "B0071JADFU", "B00005JPFX"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 72898}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 16.95, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B00005JP0F", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GQE7TQ72L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)"}

{"description": "Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's Endis a rollicking voyage in the same spirit of the two earlierPiratesfilms, yet far darker in spots (and nearly three hours to boot). The action, largely revolving around a pirate alliance against the ruthless East India Trading Company, doesn't disappoint, though the violence is probably too harsh for young children. Through it all, the plucky cast (Keira Knightley, Orlando Bloom, Geoffrey Rush) are buffeted by battle, maelstroms, betrayal, treachery, a ferocious Caribbean weather goddess, and that gnarly voyage back from the world's end--but with their wit intact. As always, Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow tosses off great lines ; he chastises \"a woman scorned, like which hell hath no fury than!\" He insults an opponent with a string of epithets, ending in \"yeasty codpiece.\"!In the previousThe Curse of the Black Pearl, Sparrow was killed--sent to Davy Jones' Locker. In the opening scenes, the viewer sees that death has  not been kind to Sparrow--but that's not to say he hasn't found endless ways to amuse himself, cavorting with dozens of hallucinated versions of himself on the deck of the Black Pearl. But Sparrow is needed in this world, so a daring rescue brings him back. Keith Richards' much ballyhooed appearance as Jack's dad is little more than a cameo, though he does play a wistful guitar. But the action, as always, is more than satisfying, held together by Depp, who, outsmarting the far-better-armed British yet again, causes a bewigged commander to muse: \"Do you think he plans it all out, or just makes it up as he goes along?\" As far as fans are concerned, it matters not.--A.T. HurleyOn the DVDHere's something you can't say about just any DVD extras: There appears to bemoreof Keith Richards in the outtakes, interviews, and other special features on theAt World's Enddisc than in the actual film. For those scenes alone, this special edition is well worth the price. Richards looks as woozy and gamey as all the rumors suggested, and answers questions he's not asked, with Johnny Depp sitting next to him, almost acting as a translator. Richards offers pithy comments like, \"Everything I do is original, you better believe,\" and smiles when other cast members call him \"Two-Take Richards\" for supposedly nailing his scenes.The packed second disc also includes a terrific mini-doc on how the filmmakers created the famous maelstrom, in an enormous hanger in Palmdale, California, with the ships floating 30 feet off the ground. \"Just moving theBlack Pearlwas an enormous undertaking,\" says producer Jerry Bruckheimer with serious understatement. Other cool extras include \"Tale of the Many Jacks,\" deleted scenes with great commentary, \"The World of Chow Yun-Fat,\" a bio of composer Hans Zimmer, features on the set designers, a look at the impressive Brethren Court, and some hilarious bloopers. \"You can't curse in a Disney film,\" deadpans Depp when a costar blurts out something blue. \"See? I told him.\" The extras are truly as much of a rollicking adventure as the film.--A.T.

{"description": "In this inspirational costume drama, Michael Apted (49 Up) recounts a period in British history sure to be unfamiliar to most Americans. In fact, his eye-opening biography of 18th century abolitionist William Wilberforce (Ioan Gruffudd) is likely to come as a revelation to many Britons, as well. After all, despite the presence of his wife, Barbara (Romola Garai), this isn't a particularly \"sexy\" story, but itisa powerful one. The title comes from John Newton's hymn \"Amazing Grace\" (\"I once was lost but now am found\"). Newton (Albert Finney) was a former slaveholder, who became a clergyman and spent his days repenting. While America had John Brown, England had Wilberforce, and Newton is one of many who helped the MP to abolish slavery in the UK. The story begins towards the end of Wilberforce's mission when he's sick with colitis and addicted to laudanum. Apted continues to alternate between 1797 and 1789, when Wilberforce was fitter and more idealistic, and ends in 1807 as his efforts come to fruition. Apted and writer Steven Knight (Dirty Pretty Things) do right by their hero. UnlikeAmistad, however, slaves are largely off-screen, with the exception of author Equiano (Senegalese vocalist Youssou N'Dour).Amazing Gracereserves its focus for the politicians who risked their reps for the greater good, like Wilberforce and Prime Minister Pitt (an excellent Benedict Cumberbatch), and those more concerned with the income slavery provided their constituents, like Lord Tarleton (Ciar&#xE1;n Hinds) and the Duke of Clarence (Toby Jones).--Kathleen C.

{"description": "There are loads of extras onThe Spiderwick Chronicles (Two-Disc Field Guide Edition), beginning with a charming overview of the film's supernatural species conducted by director Mark Waters. Waters leads viewers through a primer describing such magical creatures as brownies, ogres, and fairies, taking the whole matter very seriously in the event anyone watching should ever encounter their like. \"It's a Spiderwick World!\" introduces Tony DiTerlizzi and Holly Black, creators of theThe Spiderwick Chroniclesbook series. The authors discuss the strange inspiration for the story: a letter they received from three siblings who claimed to have gone through exactly what the characters inSpiderwickendure. \"Arthur Spiderwick's Field Guide\" is a text- and illustration-based list of creatures in the film, with lots of fascinating factoids. \"Field Guild In-Movie Mode\" allows a viewer to enjoy the benefit of a pop-up guide that appears at times  during the film and lets a viewer click onto helpful information.\"Spiderwick: Meet the Clan!\" is an introduction to the film's cast, with a special emphasis on young star Freddie Highmore's precocious talent, a British child playing twin American brothers with unique speech patterns. \"Making Spiderwick!\" is a behind-the-scenes documentary on production of the film, focusing on production design, location, cinematography, and so on. Among the revelations is that everyone involved was looking for a place to film that could evoke a horror movie yet not be so scary as to turn off youngsters. \"The Magic of Spiderwick\" is a remarkable tour of the special-effects process that made this film work so well. Waters says his directing chores continued all the way through post-production, when he had to switch from directing actors to directing animators, often acting out the defining behaviors of the various mythic characters. \"A Final Word of Advice!\" brings Waters back in front of the camera, reminding us all how to deal with  hobgoblins and other spooks (keep a lot of honey, crackers and red tomato sauce around). Finally, \"Deleted Scenes\" includes some material that didn't make the feature's final cut, but which is shown in context with scenes that were on screen. The result is a more satisfying and enriching experience of deleted scenes than is usually found on DVD special features.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000OYCM5I", "B001NPD9JA", "1442487984", "B00AEFYIQ8", "B000Q66FB6", "1416986855", "B00139W3NE", "B0012IWO0I", "1416990119", "B001APZMJS", "0689859414", "B00AEFZ6V4", "B0016Q2D5M", "B00005JPH2", "B001LPWGBO", "B007R6DJP8", "B000DBHX4M", "B00443FMZM", "B000E8M0VA", "B000XUUQRE", "B004AKCME8", "B00009XUM5", "B002ZG99KO", "B002935GMS", "B004M1A21K", "1416903453", "B003RHZ6IE", "1416927573", "B00CWM58WY", "B000031EGV", "B004VMWTIO", "B003HARV3Y", "1442486929", "B0009NZ2KG", "B002OMIKHC", "0689859376", "B0012EM5D8", "B000P0J09W", "B00437IEI6", "B000YGGNMO", "0689859406", "0689859368", "B00LG6YEKE", "B008JFUNTG", "B00005JNQS", "B00128VA76", "B000065V42", "B001U3D88M", "B000M343BC", "B001LPWGFA", "0689859384", "B000V6I7M6", "0689859392", "B004SIPAFK", "B000NA28I4", "B001GCUO7A", "B00979KQFO", "B002GJTYIW", "B00AEFY9RG", "B004P7CNXQ", "B000BPL2GK", "B00G5G7EXY", "0689871333", "B004SIP75S", "B000J10FLY", "1442486945", "B0006JMLRK", "B00005JMCW", "B000C3L27U", "B003L20IJM", "B000NOKJC2", "B0000AK7AA", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B002WJI2QQ", "B0001HAISG", "0739356151", "B002ZG97YM", "B000P0J0A6", "B0018ATR2S", "B00005JLOT", "B000BITUVG", "B00003CXC3", "B00005JN5E", "B0000VCZKW", "6305123454", "B002NZK5SW", "B002UOMH00", "B00H5RYIBI", "B00AKGG5PS", "B00I6JOD2S", "B00BTYSIWI", "B005FLSZQU", "0689871325", "B00CHVJODE", "B00B04NIZO", "B00000K3D4", "B00009M9BK", "0689871317", "B0000640SC", "B003UYUQZW"], "bought_together": ["B000OYCM5I"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000OYCM5I", "B00AEFYIQ8", "B00HR34TBE", "B00HR2WIRC"]}, "price": 35.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 215455}, "asin": "B00005JPXS", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51YZb2i09tL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Spiderwick Chronicles (2-Disc Field Guide Edition)"}
{"description": "Available uncut for the first time, the five episodes ofDavy  Crockettthat aired on Walt Disney's \"Disneyland\" show (1954-55) launched  one of the great pop culture crazes of the '50s. An estimated $300 million worth  of Crockett merchandise was sold during the first eight months of the craze,  including 10 million \"coonskin\" caps. Disney didn't spend a lot on the  original episodes, but as host Leonard Maltin observes, the colorful location  and matte shots distinguishedDavy Crockettfrom the cheesy-looking  westerns of the 1950s. The three original episodes were later recut into the  theatrical featureDavy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier(1955); the  more comic adventures from the second season that introduced the flamboyant  riverman Mike Fink (Jeffrey York) becameDavy Crockett and the River  Pirates(1956). Tall and ruggedly handsome, if somewhat limited as an actor,  Fess Parker was effective as the laconic frontiersman. The more experienced  Buddy Ebsen (playing sidekick Georgie Russel) carried many of their scenes.  Fifty years later,Davy Crockettremains an engaging example of national  myth making. Younger viewers may be surprised to find this straightforward hero  retains much of his appeal in an uncertain time.--Charles Solomon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0001I55WO", "B000GH3CDY", "B000ATQYV0", "B000GH3CDO", "B000ATQYUQ", "B0029R81BC", "B0000DZTNF", "B0029R81BM", "B00005KARE", "B001DPHDCE", "B00IS6WQ2S", "B00006II6O", "B00005KARF", "B00005KARD", "B0000BWVAI", "B0000BWVAG", "B000ICM5RG", "B0002S64UK", "B000ATQYU6", "B000ATQYUG", "B00006II6P", "B0000BWVAH", "B0002S64UU", "B00005JM6F", "B000RMLMFI", "B000P2XMJ4", "B00006II6N", "B00IP965IO", "B00GJT22VQ", "B0007Z9QXK", "B000ICM5QM", "B001DPHDCO", "B0000BWVAF", "B001SXZ7TM", "B0002S64UA", "B000ICM5R6", "B00IXPWGIS", "B000ICM5S0", "B00IZ27GD4", "B00J9BZ4KC", "B00IU6HPIQ", "B00668IFWA", "B005GYZR3U", "B000VE4UCO", "B009RNK0YC", "B001LM64VK", "B00553K9NA", "B005LVIP1E", "B00IGK6TGU", "B00HRISNPM", "B000NIVJG8", "B004UO62RM", "B00006675V", "B001992NXI", "B0050PZLBI", "B007AAF3FK", "B00BLN4UVU", "B00005RRG7", "B000VE4UC4", "B00DOZNIVG", "B00005JLJC", "B0006VXFLE", "B00E8RVSZC", "B0000DZ3EG", "B002ITSAHQ", "B0001Z51LC", "B00CP6YNDM", "B00005UWA8", "0393067580", "B00BCMSYDU", "B000VE4UCE", "B00ADVCOUK", "0689859449", "B001E6HUXO", "096403381X", "B00132D7Y0", "B004H83IGY", "B009OE2NS0", "B00EC9UHVM", "B00005JNF2", "B00005JKU0", "B00BR0SECI", "B00F6D62O4", "B005HMHPHC", "B001BN4WHW", "B0002XVQNK", "B00195I3P4", "B00B00HUC0", "B004H83INM", "B0048MD8KU", "B008D9NI54", "B00CL151P0", "B003K1NGXE", "B009V2KO9K", "B00BLN4V2I", "B001DJ7Q0E", "B0000DZ3G5", "B008F283Y0", "B0000648YD"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0001I55WO", "B000GH3CDY", "B000GH3CDO", "B00005RRG7"]}, "price": 9.66, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 27291}, "asin": "B00005KARG", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51F8Y8H88QL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Walt Disney Treasures: Davy Crockett - The Complete Televised Series"}

{"description": "To callPearl Harbora throwback to old-time war movies is something of an understatement. Director Michael Bay's epic take on the bombing that brought the United States into World War II hijacks every war movie situation and clich&#xE9; (some affectionate, some stale) you've ever seen and gives them a shiny, glossy spin until the whole movie practically gleams. Planes glisten, water sparkles, trees beckon--and Bay's re-creation of the bombing itself, a 30-minute sequence that's tightly choreographed and amazingly photographed, sets the action movie bar up quite a few notches. And in updating the classic war film, Bay and screenwriter Randall Wallace (Braveheart) use that old plot standby, the love triangle--this time, it's between two pilots (Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett) and a nurse (Kate Beckinsale) who find themselves stationed at Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, during what they thought would be a nice, sunny tour of duty. Then, of course, history intervened.For the first 90 minutes of the movie, Affleck and Beckinsale find a nice, appealing chemistry that plays on his strengths as a movie star and hers as a serious actress--he gives her glamour, she gives him smarts. Their truncated romance--the beginning of which is told in flashback so we can get right to the point where he has to leave her to go to England--works, thanks to their charm. They're no Kate and Leo fromTitanic(a strategy the film strives hard toward), but they're pretty darn adorable in their own right. Hartnett, as the not entirely unwelcome third wheel, squints bravely but makes only a slight dent in the film. Everyone else inPearl Harbor--from Cuba Gooding Jr.'s brave navy seaman to Jon Voight's able impersonation of FDR--is pretty much a glorified walk-on, taking a backseat to the pyrotechnics and action sequences that keep the three-hour film in fairly constant motion. But when that action does take hold,Pearl Harboris quite a thrilling ride.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B00003CXTG", "B00005NTOG", "B00005JKCH", "B00005JYBD", "B000EHSVSC", "B00000G3PA", "B00BEIYLO8", "B0087F7VSY", "B0013FDM7E", "B00AEBBAEK", "B000H30B2C", "B001GKJ2E8", "B002ZG976U", "B000K7UBTS", "B007SPPANM", "B0000AMRJE", "B000BMSUJK", "B00005R24K", "B00003CXTF", "B004751DFU", "6304711891", "B0090XLDKY", "B008JFUPFI", "B008YB9346", "B00CNW9ZI6", "B000AQ69PY", "B0002F6BRE", "B00AEFXUL2", "B003UAKE9Y", "B000E8M0VA", "0786890053", "B00012QM8G", "B0071JADFU", "B009JBWOU0", "B008JFUOWM", "B005S9EK5Y", "B0000DIXDR", "B00G6HO368", "B000683VI4", "B001QTXM5Y", "B00AEFY0F2", "B000AP04OM", "B001IBIHQ4", "B001EN71DQ", "B000E6ESIK", "B00JPS7HOA", "B0083SBMBM", "B00EJX2YGM", "B00003CXB4", "B0084IG8TM", "B00BEZTMFY", "B00005N7Z1", "B000E6ESEY", "B004LWZWFQ", "B00FN5Z8UY", "B000VXWK86", "B00003CXCT", "B005OCFGTO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00003CXTG", "B00005NTOG", "B001IBIHQ4", "B00006CXSS"]}, "price": 9.38, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 336850}, "asin": "B00005O893", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51T2W53WCGL._SX300_.jpg", "title": "Pearl Harbor (60th Anniversary Commemorative Gift Set)"}

{"description": "In the year 225 A.B. (After the Bomb), a group of post-apocalyptic bikers discover an abandoned research laboratory filled with food, waterand thousands of rats.  But these are no ordinary vermin; these are super-intelligent mutant rodents with a ravenous appetite for human flesh. Can a bunch of heavily armed but not-too-bright human scavengers survive a night of terror against the most hungry and horrific predators on earth? Directed by the notorious Bruno Mattei (Hell of the Living Dead, Emmanuelle in Prison), this hilarious 1983 Italian shocker is filled with over-the-top gore, bottom-of-the-barrel dialogue and attacks by what appear to be thousands of painted guinea pigs, all capped with a twist ending that must be seen to be believed.

{"description": "After the huge, lavish spectacles of previous tours, U2 decided to tone  things down a bit forElevation, which accompanied theirAll That You Can't Leave Behindalbum. Just as the album marked a return to a simpler more stripped-down  sound, the live shows returned to smaller venues and a more intimate show, and  from start to finishElevationprovides a welcome reminder of what a  great band this is. Recorded in Boston, the show features a healthy mix of new  and old songs, which were written over the course of two decades but sound as  fresh and relevant as ever. From classics like \"Sunday Bloody Sunday,\" \"Where  the Streets Have No Name,\" and \"I Will Follow\" right up to instant favorites  such as \"Beautiful Day\" and \"Elevation,\" every track is stunningly executed.

{"description": "The Hearseis an example of a horror movie subgenre: the demon-possessed vehicle. When Jane Hardy inherits her late aunt's home, she faces just such a vehicle in the form of a vintage hearse. Tormented by the car and harassed by mysterious townsfolk, Jane has to unlock her aunt's hidden secrets or perish. Part of the suspense comes from wondering if Jane is being tormented by the supernatural, her fragile emotional state, or someone just trying to scare Jane off her property.Possessed-car suspensers can be surprisingly effective and frightening. Unfortunately, this movie is a fairly low-budget effort, offering up many standard suspense techniques that were pretty shopworn even in 1980. The end result is a film that is predictable, and has few if any real chills.

{"description": "The first episodes ofI Love Lucy, in comedy terms, look today like a promising map of great things to come from the hugely influential sitcom.  This set of episodes, the first volume in a definitive collection of the classic television series, includes the original three broadcast episodes from October 1951, plus the so-called \"Lost Pilot\" that finds the earliestI Love Lucyproduction quite rough but genuinely promising. The actual episodes that American audiences first saw--\"The Girls Want to Go to a Nightclub,\" \"Be a  Pal,\" and \"The Diet\"--find familiar elements of the classic series already in place. Housewife Lucy (Lucille Ball), restless for excitement, is married to Cuban bandleader Ricky Ricardo (Desi Arnaz). Ricky's crazy nightclub career, however, leaves him yearning for a quiet home life and a wife content with her simple chores. Alas, it's not to be. With best friends Ethel (Vivian Vance) and Fred (William Frawley) usually aboard for the Ricardos' misadventures,I Love Lucyintroduced an engaging blend of sophistication and slapstick, all wrapped in the intimacy of a three-camera TV approach. Bonus material is very satisfying, including a radio broadcast from 1951 later adapted into a TV script, a couple of gaffes, guest cast listings, and a new beginning for the second-season rebroadcast of \"The Diet.\"--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000065U39", "B00006DXXU", "B008VNI9TC", "B008L3653O", "B008KZX7W0", "B00290X6NW", "B008L36520", "B00008972C", "B00GOC75YW", "B008VNIBTK", "B008L3650M", "B00006DXXV", "B00008972D", "B000094J61", "B000094J60", "B0000AI42C"], "bought_together": ["B000065U39", "B00006DXXU"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B008KZX7W0", "B008L36520", "B008L3653O", "B008VNI9TC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 273298}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 14.48, "brand": "Paramount Home Video", "asin": "B000065U38", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51K32PS584L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "I Love Lucy - Season One (Vol. 1)"}

Dad,\" notes a disapproving Ross) who becomes Monica's (Courtney Cox) lover. Joey (Matt LeBlanc) finds success (albeit short-lived) as Dr. Drake Ramoray on \"Days of Our Lives\" and moves out (\"We're not Bert and Ernie,\" he tells roommate Chandler). Future Emmy winner Lisa Kudrow's best season is to come, but, as Phoebe, she makes the most of some memorable subplots, including her shocked discovery of sad movie endings she had been shielded from (\"The One Where Old Yeller Dies\"), her dispute with Ross over evolution (\"The One Where Heckles Dies\"), and her channeling of an elderly woman who died on her massage table (\"The One with the Lesbian Wedding\"). Praise is due unsung hero Lauren Tom, so charming and sweet in the thankless role as Julie, the Girl Who Comes Between Ross and Rachel. Adam Goldberg also makes an indelible impression in his three-episode stint as Chandler's new \"psycho\" roommate. Notable omissions from this set include chapter stops for each episode, and uh, ahem, hel-LOH, how about commentary from the cast?--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B003TNW02G", "B0000844MI", "B003TNW04Y", "B0000C2IXN", "B003TNW030", "B005IA9JQ8", "B003TNW03K", "B0006ZM8M2", "B0001AW066", "B003TNW03A", "B005IA9JRM", "B005IA9JQI", "B005IA9JSG", "B005MG8UNG", "B00020HAWY", "B000ERVK5S", "B000TM1CKQ", "B0001BS3IY", "B00005JLEX", "B00B04NII6", "B0000CGNEC", "B000F3UAE8", "B0009A407A", "B000HT3P7E", "B00B04NJ1M", "B007C8RZJW", "B000B5XOW0", "B00382S9UA", "B00EQ2KU7G", "B008L0YMZA", "B00005JOHC", "B0002UE1WQ", "B000AJJNI6", "B0018RKEQE", "B001AQO3V0", "B000GPIPTM", "B00382S9SW", "B001BNFR6M", "B00GOC74QG", "B00K7IPFSM", "B000FUTVLO", "B0053FANT0", "B003SNJY1C", "B000GETTKM", "B0009W5J4Q", "B007C8RZL0", "B004STBEXQ", "B002WC89WK", "B00005JO3P", "B000RC2ES2", "B00005JM9Q", "B000H7JCG4", "B000FVQLIO", "B003L77G6A", "B00007IG1M", "B00009Y3RW", "B0011UO91E", "B003SNJXMC", "0792845773", "B000EBGFPY", "B0015RRNMA", "B0058JEHSO", "B000B8IA08", "B001IBIDLI", "B0024FAD8I", "B004STBF2G", "B002BWOYKC", "B008L0YN18", "B00005JNEQ", "B0058JEHTS", "B0019CSXAM", "B000W91RUG", "B000QFCDAO", "B00382S9U0", "B000NOKFH6", "B002BJGYU8", "B00005JNOG", "B0007YXRCW", "B0015ABRE2", "B001VPJYZ0", "B001DPHDBU", "B001DMVZJO", "B001A4VH2U", "B001L1S1PS", "B000SINT4S", "B002N5N5NE", "B002N5N4M6", "B000FIMG5Y", "B000EHSVLE", "B0001907BW", "B000EQ45BU", "B0077PTWHI", "B000R9YLKY", "B00382S9T6", "B00447L4KA", "B002AMVED8", "B00005JO9J", "B00166UFSY", "B001MVWRNE", "B00HEQOAIQ"], "bought_together": ["B003TNW02G", "B0000844MI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005IA9JVI", "B003TNW02G", "B005IA9JQ8", "B005IA9JRM"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 14256}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 24.74, "brand": "Warner Brothers", "asin": "B000068CNX", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51axKeo57VL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Friends: Season 2"}

{"description": "Not the Steven Spielberg blockbuster, thisLost Worldis a splendid 2001 BBC TV dramatization of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's famousadventure story. Bob Hoskins makes an unusually genial Professor Challenger, far less of a bully than Doyle's character, but his slightly stereotyped companions are nicely filled out by a solid cast. James Fox is Challenger's more timid but still covertly adventurous rival, Tom Ward is the mustachioed big-game hunter who faces an allosaur with an elephant gun, and Matthew Rhys plays the tagalong reporter hoping to impress his faithless fianc&#xE9;e.As usual, the adaptation adds a woman--orphaned jungle girl Elaine Cassidy--to the expedition, and an interesting villain (religious fanatic Peter Falk) beefs up the travelogue by marooning Challenger's gang on the South American plateau where dinosaurs, cavemen, and Indians coexist eventfully. TheWalking with Dinosaurs-style effects work well for the TV frame, but the real success is in integrating the adventuring with subtle eco-awareness, complex character interplay, and the reliable wonder of soaring pteranodons and carnosaur attacks.--Kim Newman", "related": {"also_bought": ["B008L0YMVE", "B000SAGGL4", "B001BGS17Q", "B00007JMD8", "B001V7P2X6", "B0016MJ6HE", "B000KP62F2", "0486400603", "B00005JKU0", "B005PF9KD8", "1848511973"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B008L0YMVE", "B0000E69H6", "B000SAGGL4", "B0001I2CFC"]}, "price": 5.0, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 121414}, "asin": "B00006JDQP", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51269DWPFEL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Lost World"}

{"description": "On March 12, 2002,The Shieldburst onto the FX network like an incendiary grenade, and basic cable TV would never be the same. Creator Shawn Ryan's uncompromising police drama pushed the limits of basic-cable permissiveness, bridging the relative discretion ofNYPD Blueand the HBO liberties ofThe Wire. Without exception, these 13 episodes justify their hype, focusing on pugnacious detective Vic Mackey (Michael Chiklis), whose amoral Strike Team employs dubious tactics in the crime-ridden (and fictional) Farmington district of Los Angeles. Mackey and his maverick partners are at odds with seasoned detectives and beat cops, escalating tensions with precinct Capt. Aceveda (Benito Martinez), a Latino with flexible scruples and a political agenda.The series invites viewers to form their own judgments regarding Mackey's volatile behavior, which includes killing an undercover cop in the electrifying pilot episode. While each episode stands alone as groundbreaking drama, the arc of the series incorporates Aceveda's campaign to end Mackey's career; the self-loathing of a homosexual rookie (Michael Jace) whose partner (Catherine Dent) is Mackey's occasional mistress; a straight-laced detective (Jay Karnes) yearning for respect; Mackey's compassionate attempt to rehabilitate a crack whore (Jamie Brown, giving the season's finest guest performance); the autism of Mackey's young son and the recklessness of his closest partner (Walton Goggins); and the vigilant stoicism of Det. Wyms (CCH Pounder), who's as sensibly upright as Mackey is corrupted.Teeming with gang-bangers, perverts, rapists, and killers,The Shieldis unabashedly adult; even liberal viewers may flinch at plots involving child pornography and serial murder. Chiklis deservedly won an Emmy for maintaining the series' delicate morality; Mackey's a hero squirming in his own ethical quicksand. This daring edginess makesThe Shieldunique, and generous DVD supplements explore Ryan's creative impulse. Two featurettes offer behind-the-scenes overviews, while the all-episode commentaries allow extensive insight from every member of the series' principal cast and crew. Audition tapes prove that the cast was primed for ensemble excellence, and deleted scenes further demonstrate the series' challenging ambiguity.The Shieldis excellent TV for those who can grasp its complexities; all others beware.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0012CJQYG", "B0012CJQYQ", "B0012CJQZ0", "B0012CJQZA", "B0015TX2LO", "B0020TS5EM", "B0002ERXC2", "B00DJYJRHG", "B00188XHF8", "B0038M2APA", "B00123BY6S", "B000YW8RPE", "B0025KVKDE", "B0006IUD9Y", "B000QXDJLI", "B00B5J6A7W", "B00188XHFI", "B00005Y6YJ", "B0008JIJ1A", "B000FTCLSU", "B004HW7JNS", "B007A2Z3Y4", "B000GH3CWK", "B001NXDIMK", "B009VXVMAO", "B000ENUYGI", "B000FKO3GW", "B003XMKUEI", "B001DJLCRC", "B0060MYKYY", "B000NDEXK2", "B00EEDNR9A", "B002N5N5QQ", "B0024FAR5M", "B00008YGRU", "B00008PHCZ", "B00003CXOP", "B0000Y40PW", "B00AB65RUG", "B002ZCY80O", "B0058YPG1G", "B000BZISRG", "B0032UYFA6", "B001RTSPVY", "B003L77GK6", "B0002XVQSU", "B00CT48W14", "B000EXDS0C", "B0006FO5LO", "B0001O3YLM", "B00HUCF420", "B001934SNM", "B005SEDI5M", "B000Q6GUW0", "B000GB75CO", "B0058YPGSY", "B0058YPPN0", "B00BFAIH68", "B000OIOOVE", "B000V86OKG", "B00BUEUH6C", "B00ITAQ2T6", "B0001I55ZQ", "B001QE99AQ", "B000FIMG68", "B0024F08RO", "B00000FBH2", "B000P6YNSE", "B005LAJ16I", "B0015ABRE2", "B00J5LXT44", "B003CPPY5G", "B00HT850YW", "B005LAJ1H2", "B000FFJYE8", "B00005NOHO", "B000RO6JY0", "B000BOH8YG", "B00BC5I6Q2", "B009LDCZ7I", "B000CR7RCK", "B002DQSKME", "B000FUTVLO", "B0015RRNMA", "B002N5N5M0", "B009LDD54K", "B000GTLQVW", "B00915G6WQ", "B0007YMVWO", "B001MVWRNE", "B0036TGTF2", "B00BWDFP5E", "B002WQ799U", "B000BOH986", "B000RF1QE2", "B002WQ79A4", "B00031TYBC", "B000YABIQ6", "B00CD45JBG", "B0013ZGN9I"], "bought_together": ["B0012CJQYG", "B0012CJQYQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00DJYJRHG", "B0012CJQYG", "B0038M2APA", "B0012CJQYQ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 125999}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 24.99, "brand": "20th Century Fox", "asin": "B00006RCNW", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51G3B35AR4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Shield - The Complete First Season"}
{"description": "This delightfully entertaining romantic comedy stars Reese Witherspoon (LEGALLY BLONDE) as sophisticated Melanie Carmichael, a rising New York clothing designer who suddenly finds herself engaged to the city's most eligible bachelor.

{"description": "A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court Bing Crosby stars in this light and lively musical version of Mark Twain's timeless comedy. Der Bingle is a turn-of-the-century blacksmith who is knocked unconscious only to awaken in sixth-century Camelot. But thanks to some American know-how, the crooner is quickly hailed as a wiz of a wizard and granted the right to teach Rhonda Fleming, the King's fetching niece, some decidedly contemporary romantic tricks. Alas, there's trouble afoot when Bing locks \"magical\" horns with the all-powerful Merlin and is challenged to a joust by Sir Lancelot for the hand of the beautiful princess! Co-starring Sir Cedric Hardwicke and William Bendix, the classic fantasy also features a marvelous score by Jimmy Van Heusen and Johnny Burke, along with such hits as \"Busy Doing Nothing\" and \"Once and for Always.\" The Emperor Waltz Just imagine: Viennese royalty, elegantly dressed ladies, dashing courtiers, and Bing Crosby in his old straw hat sharing the Danube and the court of Emperor Franz Joseph. It's a recipe for sure-fire fun. Bing plays Virgil Smith, an American phonograph salesman whose fox terrier companion takes a fancy to the persnickety poodle of countess Johanna Augusta (Joan Fontaine). While some may call it puppy love, it turns out that romance is not just going to the dogs. Virgil's openness and congeniality start to melt the icy coolness of the Viennese royal, who struggles with whether or not to dare defy convention in her tradition-oriented homeland. The lush scenery provides a gorgeous backdrop for the wooing and canoeing that take place in the land of blue rivers and Strauss waltzes. Add an element of good old American humor and Bing's smooth sounds, and The Emperor Waltz is a delightfully entertaining trip to the musical wonders of old Vienna, Hollywood-style. Music, merriment, and romance blend blissfully while Bing sings \"Friendly Mountains\" and \"I Kiss Your Hand, Madam,\" and Strauss melodies fill the air. This film is a real treat for fans of all ages.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00007J5VP", "B00AATV050", "B00007J5VQ", "B000HA4WRU", "B0041T50J2", "B00EKGXA84", "B0001FGBZW", "B0000AGWJ3", "B004G9C7RK", "B0015FGCI8", "B00KIZY3XW", "B000KJTGHO", "B004VUR68O", "B00J7YV09K", "B000J0NXXW", "B00GJNQ65U", "B003UMW67K", "079215519X", "B00IF0KASY", "B00F6SHECS", "B000EBD9S0", "B007XTDXY6", "B00GJT1ZPU", "B008M4C1BC", "B00004VVMZ", "B0006B2A6U", "0486415910", "B0001ZWLSS", "B000KJU13M", "B00006G8EX", "B00005UMFB", "B0001NBMEE", "B003MJZ07E", "B003E697LA", "B00IF0KAYS", "B007XTDXF0", "B00178T3Q6", "B0024FAG1C", "B00005JNA9", "B000KJU13C", "B000N3T0GO", "B00914ETQW", "B00K8CQ1Q2", "B0024FAG1M", "B0007939NO", "B00JX3SHIC", "B000059GEI", "B000I0QL82", "B00143XE28", "B00BY8DAAE", "B00GXKZQIM", "B000P6R9C6", "B000FFJ83A", "B00AATV046", "B00BGGITX2", "B008D1Q1VU", "B003XXCC8E", "B000EBD9RG", "B00DZP1BVO", "B000PAAK5A", "B00008ZZ7B", "B0009W5J6E", "B00C3ALLFS", "B0000DD77W", "B0041EVYYM", "B000059ZTM", "B00133QNU4", "B00AEFXD1O", "B004D9ADD8", "B00BGGIX0G", "B00023P4O2", "B0001FR55C", "B000E8JO32", "B000EBD9SA", "B0012GVMIU", "B002MU4NN6", "B000FG65RQ", "B000ION7AI", "B0002ERWZ0", "B00F6SHG5S", "B00DVPMYWI", "B000EBD9SK", "B00AEFY8ZE", "B002EAYEGU", "B00BMQODGI", "B00407PNWO", "B00IB3SDRK", "B0001FGBZM", "B00008CMRO", "B00005UMF5", "B00BY8D9UU", "B005F265IE", "B00F3AE1FW", "B0045HCJ9E", "B0012GVMIK", "B00AEFXSVE", "B003IPD97U", "B009L4DSSW", "B0002XNT08", "B0045HCJJY"], "bought_together": ["B00EKGXA84", "B00AATV050"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00EKGXA84", "B00AATV050", "B004G9C7RK", "B003UMW67K"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 15317}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.49, "brand": "UNI DIST CORP.

{"description": "Director Kazuhiro Furuhashi has recut the four-episodeSamurai XOVA into a seamless feature that serves as a prequel to bothSamurai X: The  Movieand the light-hearted TV series. The action unfolds in 1864, at the  beginning of the revolution against the Tokugawa Shogunate that culiminated  in the Meiji Restoration. The orphan Shinta is transformed by master swordsman  Hiko into Kenshin,  an assassin who believes he is using his sword to bring  about a better world. When he and the mysterious Tomoe hide from the intrigues  of Kyoto in a remote mountain village, Kenshin finds peace, raising crops and  savoring the passage of the seasons, but this tranquility cannot endure.

{"description": "Jack Bauer is having another one of his \"very bad days\" in the second season of the groundbreaking real-time thriller24. Once again the hours are ticking by with more guaranteed cliffhangers than a convention of mountain climbers. Holed up in a Los Angeles condo and estranged from his daughter, Jack is no longer on the government payroll; unfortunately for him, this small fact doesn't seem to matter to President David Palmer and the NSA, who call him back in to the CTU and give him 24 hours to infiltrate a terrorist organization that is planning to detonate a dirty bomb in the city of angels. All Jack wants is to get his daughter out of the city, unfortunately Kim's new employer, the abusive father of the child she is nannying, has other ideas.Fans of theoriginalwon't be disappointed, as there are more than enough shock moments in the first few hours to hint at the climactic build-up to come, while newcomers can quickly get involved in the lives of Jack and his family. There are some new characters to bolster the veteran cast and, interestingly (although not surprisingly), Jack's character has taken an altogether darker, more psychopathic turn. The danger the characters find themselves in also has a much more global, not to mention topical, impetus, grounded as it is in the war against terrorism.  Although the territory is more familiar this time around, this second season is just as much a high-tension, taut, adrenalin-fuelled ride as the first, and one that will have you glued to your TV for the next 24 hours.--Kristen Bowditch", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0002XVQSU", "B000NDEXK2", "B000B837XI", "B000ICLRKC", "B000NDEXKW", "B000MR8W92", "B001L5SRJE", "B002ZCY7SW", "B001DMVZOE", "B0015QWZ8S", "B002ZCY7TG", "0756632277", "B0001WHXM0", "B00G4RCXPI", "B00KPP6ZLS", "B0000DIJNU", "B000FIMG68", "B000AJJNFE", "B00005JNOG", "B00BC5I6Q2", "B001OQCVFG", "B002N5N5QQ", "B00HT850YW", "B003FSTN52", "B000Q6GUW0", "B0049P1VHS", "B00ECHBSP8", "B004UXVDJA", "B0058YPJ2W", "B00J5LXT44", "B0044E9JU0", "B001GCUER0", "B00IWTVDUW", "B002ZCY8CC", "B0058YPGSY", "B0019L21GA", "B003L77GK6", "B00GTZWZH6", "B00HEPE6MM", "B0024FAR5M", "B00KPP6R9S", "B00005JOC9", "B004EXWGHY", "B00AIBZMD6", "B009LDD1H6", "B000P6YNSE", "B000EWBNMI", "B00ITAQ2T6", "B001AI776G", "B0036EH3XE", "B0089AD8IO", "B000YABIQ6", "B00FGEO9NE", "B00HLTD3ZW", "B009LDCZ7I", "B00IKM5LXG", "B000HEVZ9E", "B003F3NDWG", "B00AB65RUG", "B00HF98SJY", "B000BF0C8E", "B000BGR1B4", "B00E8OMZGG", "B00JA3RVG4"], "bought_together": ["B000NDEXK2", "B0002XVQSU"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000NDEXK2", "B000ICLRKC", "B0002XVQSU", "B000MR8W92"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 4639}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 39.69, "brand": "20th Century Fox", "asin": "B00008YGRU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516918NBNNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "24: Season 2"}

{"description": "The later series of definitive British sitcomAre You Being  Served?--set in the hierarchical world of the sales staff of a  department store--lost several of its original cast members, but this only  gave more room for the antics of its most popular characters: The  not-so-ambiguously-gay Mr. Humphries (sterling John Inman) and the  multi-hued Mrs. Slocombe (Mollie Sugden, as regal and petulant as Queen  Victoria), ably supported by lecherous floorwalker Capt. Peacock  (wonderfully snooty Frank Thornton), affable Miss Brahms (helium-voiced  Wendy Richard), and woefully incompetent Mr. Rumbold (jug-eared Nicholas  Smith), who form a squabbling dysfunctional family within the strict  rules, bowler hats, and neck frills of Grace Brothers store. Though the  plots grow more absurd--one episode has the staff forced to sleep on a  giant waterbed in the store basement, dressed like albino Teletubbies--the  comfortable but never complacent rapport of the cast keeps the show sharp.  Even the most groan-inducing sexual double-entendres (and there are many)  gets carried off with aplomb; no matter how many times Mrs. Slocombe  refers to her poor pussy (that is to say, her cat, Tiddles), it still gets  a laugh from Sugden's unbeatable poker face. And though the writing  occasionally wears thin, some episodes are among the series' best: When  Mrs. Slocombe is temporarily given a managerial position, the overturning  of the established order is comic gold; the staging of a Punch and Judy  show lets everyone indulge in some topnotch slapstick.Are You Being  Served?is a twinkling star in the Britcom firmament, guaranteed to  turn any viewer into a delirious fan.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000069HXD", "B0002F6BT2", "B001JV5BBC", "B000069HXI", "B000069HXJ", "B000A0GOIM", "B000C1VBAA", "B000EBGFQI", "B0007KTBJO", "B000AJJNJK", "B000069HXH", "B000243DD0", "B000F7CDXA"], "bought_together": ["B0002F6BT2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002I9TZHA", "B001JV5BBC", "B0002F6BT2", "B002LFPAUC"]}, "price": 54.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 205486}, "asin": "B0000A02Y7", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RhebdVzeL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Are You Being Served?

{"description": "As the 2005 theatrical release ofSerenitymade clear,Fireflywas a science fiction concept that deserved a second chance. Devoted fans (or \"Browncoats\") knew it all along, and with this well-packaged DVD set, those who missed the show's original broadcasts can see what they missed. Creator Joss Whedon's ambitious science-fiction Western (Whedon's third series afterBuffy the Vampire SlayerandAngel) was canceled after only 11 of these 14 episodes had aired on the Fox network, but history has proven that its demise was woefully premature. Whedon's generic hybrid got off to a shaky start when network executives demanded an action-packed one-hour premiere (\"The Train Job\"); in hindsight the intended two-hour pilot (also titled \"Serenity,\" and oddly enough, the final episode aired) provides a better introduction to the show's concept and splendid ensemble cast. Obsessive fans can debate the quirky logic of combining spaceships with direct parallels to frontier America (it's 500 years in the future, and embattled humankind has expanded into the galaxy, where undeveloped \"outer rim\" planets struggle with the equivalent of Old West accommodations), but Whedon and his gifted co-writers and directors make it work, at least well enough to fashion a credible context from the incongruous culture-clashing of past, present, and future technologies, along with a polyglot language (the result of two dominant superpowers) that combines English with an abundance of Chinese slang.What makes it work is Whedon's delightfully well-chosen cast and their nine well-developed characters--a typically Whedon-esque extended family--each providing a unique perspective on their adventures aboard Serenity, the junky but beloved \"Firefly-class\" starship they call home. As a veteran of the disadvantaged Independent faction's war against the all-powerful planetary Alliance (think of it as Underdogs vs. Overlords), Serenity captain Malcolm Reynolds (Nathan Fillion) leads his compact crew on a quest for survival. They're renegades with an amoral agenda, taking any job that pays well, butFirefly'scomplex tapestry of right and wrong (and peace vs. violence) is richer and deeper than it first appears. Tantalizing clues about Blue Sun (an insidious mega-corporation with a mysteriously evil agenda), its ties to the Alliance, and the traumatizing use of Serenity's resident stowaway (Summer Glau) as a guinea pig in the development of advanced warfare were clear indicationsFireflywas heading for exciting revelations that were precluded by the series' cancellation. Fortunately, the big-screenSerenity(which can be enjoyed independently of the series) ensured that Whedon's wild extraterrestrial west had not seen its final sunset. Its very existence confirms that these 14 episodes (and enjoyable bonus features) will endure as irrefutable proof Fox made a glaring mistake in canceling the series. --Jeff ShannonBeyondFireflyon DVDWatchStargate: Continuumon DVDCatch up onStargate Atlantison DVDCheck outSunshineon DVDStills fromFirefly(Click for larger image)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000BW7QWW", "B001M5UDGS", "B001KOFH2G", "B00E688AZE", "1593074492", "B002JVWR4U", "B0024FAR66", "B0006FO9B0", "1781161682", "B000AJJNFE", "1595821627", "1595825614", "B0000844I8", "B006URR9HY", "B0036EH3UC", "B002GP7ZWI", "1845760824", "B00061QJSK", "B000VY1EYG", "B000EHSVN2", "B00AZMFJYA", "B000BOH8Y6", "B000BLI4PQ", "B00FR23QNE", "B0081QF6Q8", "B00GT2TEPU", "B00KHWSB5M", "B000EHSVMS", "B004YPED14", "B0009JE6G6", "B004D92S9K", "B000FOPPBA", "B000EHSVLY", "B0090SI56Y", "B003PGNBO8", "B000EHSVM8", "B00ECR7KX2", "B001MT7ZEW", "B000F8O2PQ", "B000BNI90Y", "B002ZHKZGA", "B00FSKOFKS", "B002I9Z8I0", "B00129W6LE", "B0038M2APA", "B001AQO43M", "B00BM2JVAA", "B002GY9F9K", "B000QXDCJ2", "B0007CEXUY", "B001CQONMC", "B000RZIGVS", "B007D5E7C2", "B008YOLRDS", "B001XRLWPQ", "B00F3M3VSS", "B000SMNL92", "B008JFUPFI", "B000I0RQVI", "B004EPYZPS", "B001YYQA0K", "B005PPMHO2", "B0089AD8IO", "B000U7WV1Y", "B000B8IA2G", "B00E3QJ7JC", "B00COMH99W", "B004SMDJ9U", "B008H1Q61G", "B000BCCAEQ", "B000T9OP7G", "B005LAIH2W", "B0032UYFA6", "B006TBYC76", "B003F3NDWG", "B004H85K1K", "B0041T52S6", "B000LC4ZI0", "B008JFUNHI", "0062225758", "B004L9GMBC", "B0046XG48O", "B00DII0MGI", "B006TTC5WC", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B000QDLSR0", "B004EPYZU8", "B0016Q0HY6", "B001DJLCRC", "B003L77FYS", "B000U1ZV8K", "B00E8RKHWW", "0786891424", "B00J2MPZQG", "0792844890", "B00JAD6BYW", "B007ZXW3SM", "B00IXD2MGQ", "0786891432"], "bought_together": ["B000BW7QWW", "B001M5UDGS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000BW7QWW", "B005S9EK5Y", "B001M5UDGS", "B004LWZW42"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 918}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 12.99, "brand": "20TH Century Fox", "asin": "B0000AQS0F", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Q-uS67cjL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Firefly: The Complete Series"}

{"description": "By 1939, when the earliest films in this collection were made, Mickey Mouse was the most famous cartoon character in the world. The unsuccessful hunter in \"The Pointer\" (1939) and the irrepressible magician in \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\" (1940) rank among his finest performances. In both films, he sparkles with vitality.  But as Mickey grew more popular, more restrictions were placed on what he could do, and the character grew dull. Those restrictions become obvious when the viewer compares these films with the shorts onWalt Disney Treasures: Mickey Mouse in Living Color. In \"Mickey's Birthday Party\" (1942), he clowns and stumbles through a comic dance routine, but it feels like he's working for the laughs. In 1936, when a more impish Mickey danced with a deck of cards in \"Thru the Mirror,\" the fun came from the stylish grace of his movements: That Mickey didn't need to mug for the camera. In the later films, Mickey serves as a genial straight man, with Pluto and other side characters supplying the comedy.A new generation of animators faced the same problems and restrictions when they tried to revive the character in \"Mickey's Christmas Carol\" (1983) and \"The Prince and the Pauper\" (1990). The extras include some deleted animation from \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice,\" and the five opening sequences from the \"Mickey Mouse Club\" (1955), the last time Walt Disney provided the character's voice.

{"description": "In the wake of the phenomenal success ofMy Big Fat Greek Wedding,  it seemed an obvious choice to build a sitcom around writer-star Nia  Vardalos's family life. But the sitcom was cancelled after half a  seaon--which is too bad, because thoughMy Big Fat Greek Lifedoesn't capture the same relaxed, storytelling rhythm of the movie,  almost the entire acting ensemble returns (Andrea Martin, Michael  Constantine, Lainie Kazan, Gia Carides, and Louis Mandylor; only John  Corbett, due to other obligations, was ably replaced by Steve Eckholdt as  Nia's non-Greek husband), and their skilled interplay makesMy Big Fat  Greek Lifean entirely satisfying show.

{"description": "Once upon a time, you couldn't turn on MTV without seeing Motley Crue videos in heavy rotation. For those still-loyal fans, this compilation brings back the good old days. From the band's 1982 debut,Too Fast for Love,to 2000'sNew Tattoo,these 21 videos hit on every phase of the Crue's career: they began as a Kiss wannabe, became huge arena-rockers, then stumbled through new singers and drummers before returning to the original lineup.  No real fan will go wrong with this hit list, including much time-capsule material: \"Girls Girls Girls,\" \"Dr. Feelgood,\" and \"Home Sweet Home\" contain big hair, makeup, tight pants--and that's just the band!  Bonuses include six \"alternate\" videos, including the \"X-rated\" version of \"Girls,\" showing barely more than Janet Jackson at the Super Bowl; 50 minutes of bassist Nikki Sixx and drummer Tommy Lee discussing making the clips; and Easter eggs with more hidden videos.

{"description": "TheUnderworldDVD has a powerful soundtrack that makes good use of ambient noises (e.g., bullet casings pinging on the floor) and has a clear, well-defined picture, which is especially impressive considering the film's predominant look is black leather at nighttime.  The first segment of the four-part, 54-minute documentary is mostly self-congratulation and plot summary (which is not necessarily a bad thing); more interesting are the creature effects and the actors learning how to do their own stunts.  If you were wondering if the voice of the Lycan Raze was really that deep, you can listen to him--actor/co-writer Kevin Grevioux--along with director Len Wiseman and co-writer Danny McBride on the first commentary track as they discuss breaking the rulebook for vampires and shooting in Budapest on a tiny $22 million budget.

{"description": "Charlie's Angels: The Complete Second Seasonhas no shortage of the good-natured cheese and eye candy that made the primetime television show'sdebut seasonwildly popular in 1976. The Angels had a new look in their second year: Farrah Fawcett, arguably the most popular of the show's three actresses, departed before the sophomore season and was replaced by another blonde dazzler, Cheryl Ladd. (Ladd's character, Kris Munroe, was the younger sister of Fawcett's Jill Munroe, whose exit is explained in the premiere episode as a liberated woman's career move: Jill has decided to race cars in Spain.)No sooner does Kris settle in than a crisis sweeps through off-screen Charlie's private investigation agency. While cavorting on Oahu in the two-part \"Angels in Paradise,\" Charlie is kidnapped by a smuggler (France Nuyen), who demands the Angels break her husband out of jail in exchange for their boss's life. Bubbly Kris, brainy Sabrina Duncan (Kate Jackson), beauteous Kelly Garrett (Jaclyn Smith), and sidekick Bosley (David Doyle) are compelled to soak up rays and sip fruity mixed drinks in Waikiki while fighting crime in various guises, re-establishing, for another season,Charlie's Angels' dramatic and aesthetic game plan for every episode: start slow with lots of idle chatter, put the girls in a ridiculous undercover situation, and get them out of their clothes as much as possible.The pattern continues in the silly \"Angels on Ice,\" starring old hands Phil Silvers and Jim Backus, in which our heroines join an ice show to find out who kidnapped a pair of skaters. \"Pretty Angels All in a Row\" finds Kelly and Kris reluctant entrants in a \"Miss Chrysanthemum Pageant\" (no, you won't find Kate Jackson in a swimsuit this year, either) rigged by organized crime. \"Circus of Terror,\" co-starring James Darren, enlists the Angels in the carney life. If there is anything to complain about regarding season 2, it is that the novelty ofCharlie's Angelshas worn a little thin, and every episode feels the same. Still, there are surprises: \"The Sammy Davis Jr. Kidnap Caper\" stars the late rat-packer in peril and much bemused by the presence of three comely bodyguards.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000FDFSH2", "B00008WJEZ", "B0028RABR0", "B00AIA884W", "B003W5C0TY", "B00GOC750Q", "B005EVY8NA", "B004M9ZI0C", "B00080ZG2E", "B0018O5WTQ", "B000ASDFIG", "B000B8IA3U", "B005LFQRTC", "B00023GGAI", "B000Z6GT18", "B0007Y8AYC", "B008OR5X6M", "B0006Z2KZ2", "B00018D3RI", "B00AA8Q0JM", "B000GRU09I", "B003L77FWA", "B00A4Y62JU", "B00KTZALDC", "B000HEVZ7Q", "B00DYQ1GBE", "B00005JOJR", "B00HZMZ286", "B0001ZMWYG", "B00005JO4F", "B000NQRV8U", "B000E1EHPY", "B007KW5M6I", "B001HUHBC2", "B00GLPYVT4", "B00HW3L9MG", "B0014FAIXE", "B00HQLZCIQ", "B003L77FWU", "B000HIVIOC", "B00008EYBH", "B002WQ79A4", "B0014FAIYS", "B00005JO3P", "B000QUEQ68", "B00803LRK6", "B000E5KQM8", "B0002Y4T7O", "B000UX6TL6", "B0030VANIU", "B00005JLYW", "B001675ZJM", "B000CELOW2", "B0007WQHFS", "B001E6JC1M", "B009L0NC82", "B000EQ45BU", "B000ASDFIQ", "B000PMGS5E", "B00008YLVB", "B000BGR1B4", "B00G3BRC24", "B0007CNY54", "B00GOC75V0", "B000BF0C8E", "B00005JNHU", "B00GLT2SOA", "B000BUE5D2", "B000NOIX66", "B0007WFXL2", "B000PGTPC8", "B00280QNKG", "B000RZIGSQ", "B005TTEG5W", "B0014VPFKY", "B001BN4WLS", "B00ALTQRNO", "B003BGZ61S", "B000GW8UAE", "B0077T5SOA", "B000A0GORS", "B0012EM5E2", "B000E3L7FK", "B002XKKX8E", "B001DHXT7U", "B000E5KQLY", "B0009I7NH6", "B0007V6IWQ", "B000LE16VC", "B0012EM5EW", "B00008EY6N", "B0007IO6V4", "B003BGZ60Y", "B004X1M3DE", "B000O77SNG", "B000DZ95IU", "B00I458456", "B001675ZJW"], "bought_together": ["B000FDFSH2", "B00008WJEZ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B008H6GHII", "B00008WJEZ", "B0028RABR0", "B00GOC750Q"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 41873}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 8.74, "brand": "Columbia Tri Star", "asin": "B0001BS3IE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51SmYm7t0sL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Charlie's Angels: Season 2"}
{"description": "\"The cinema,\" Orson Welles famously noted, \"is a ribbon of dream.\"3 Womenis one of few feature films on record as having taken formina dream. The dreamer was Robert Altman, and although all his best work has an oneiric quality--the floaty zooms, the eerie pastels bleeding into one another, the slip and slide of characters' trajectories overlapping in the fluid accumulation of what passes for narrative--this last masterpiece in his amazing seven-year run of 1970s masterpieces is only more so. Shelly Duvall, that most unorthodox of Altman creatures, locks in the tone with her eerie portrayal of Millie Lammoreaux, a Texan hoyden whose nonstop prattle turns life into a stream-of-consciousness reverie even as most of the people in her vicinity studiously ignore her. Her primacy is worshiped, then emulated by a strange, certifiably dysfunctional childwoman named Pinky Rose (Sissy Spacek) who comes to work in the same old-age home as Millie, moves in with her, and progressively usurps her lifestyle and finally her identity. The third woman, Willie (the late Janice Rule), is a pregnant artist who paints reptilian humanoid figures on the floors of swimming pools. Willie's husband (Robert Fortier), a strutting gun nut who once had a bit part on TV'sWyatt Earp(\"He knows Hugh O'Brian\"), is just about the only male character of consequence in the film. This macho man gets his--but what \"his\" may be is only one of the movie's beguiling mysteries. It's only appropriate that the cameraman, Chuck Rosher, should be the son of the man who photographed F.W. Murnau'sSunrise.--Richard T.

Trouble is, he  can't keep out of trouble, and when he does stay clean, trouble finds  him--in this case, in the bikini-clad form of Nancy (Sara Foster), the  mistress of a local developer who gets turned on by the whiff criminal  activity. She lures Jack into a scheme that ultimately involves a solid  cast including Morgan Freeman, Charlie Sheen, Gary Sinise, Bebe Neuwirth,  Willie Nelson, and more. Foster doesn't bring much to movie besides her  alarmingly sculpted body and the ending peters out, butThe Big  Bouncehas enough snap and crackle that you don't miss the pop.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001U0HB5Q", "B0008FXT1Y", "B0000CDLBB", "B00JQF7ZR6", "B000085EFK", "B00007GZRI", "0783229402", "B00024JC4E", "0792833279", "B000NQRR34", "B0000714BV", "B000Y11BC6", "B00466H3EK", "B000A0GP0Y", "B00009V2J7", "B000ICM5X0", "B0002V7TMY", "B000BKVQS4", "B00005JMWP", "B00HF98SPS", "B0007OY2OE", "B00538MG6A", "B003EYVXXC", "B00029NMRM", "B00022XE6S", "B0013FW05Y", "B0033PSH9U", "B004XFZ4HC", "B003AWRMA6", "B00AFQSYFM", "B00005JLH0", "B000OPOAPC", "B0007KZQAM", "6305308837", "B00G7QPUII", "B00BTYU3W6", "B00GMV8M2Y", "B000O77SF4", "B0002W4UDE", "B00005JLRQ", "B00DVD5SBE", "B002NO4ISG", "B0012KJ0DK", "B003Y5H524", "B0000A2ZU3", "B000069I1H", "B00005UQ9T", "B000XA5K48", "B000065V3I", "B000SM6FLI", "B004B93RGK", "B000067IZ3", "B00008CMR1", "B007EQR0D8", "B0009RCPUW", "B004U7MR14", "B003Q6D200", "B001JIE7JC", "B000QUCRB4", "B004SEUJOQ", "B00IXD2MMU", "B000GRUMRS", "B000244GCW", "0062191357", "B008E70EES", "B000FKO5QK", "B000K7VHNW", "B00HEPC0TS", "B000FFJYBG", "0783228007", "B00J49R0ZQ", "B0007OCG56", "B00008K7AO", "B00AEFXVOI", "B002ZG97O2", "B001HVZO7A", "B00GICP7UW", "B000056PMU", "B008A6QC08", "B001RHGRT8", "B004EPZ084", "B00DZP1C2W", "B003L20IG0", "B000UNYK4E", "B00005JMX6", "B002GIBVVQ", "B000BYA4IS", "B00005JMW7", "B00008G6E8", "B000JYW5BE", "B000B8GT92", "B000K7UBSO", "B00BLF9FYA", "6305213283", "6305922675", "B0051MKNRC", "B004EPYZP8", "B00005JMIJ", "B00AEFZE48"], "bought_together": ["B001U0HB5Q"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004LWZWBU", "B00009V2J7", "0783229402", "B000BKVQS4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 45294}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.0, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00024JC30", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GF3EWRDKL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Big Bounce (Widescreen Edition)"}

Across town, the working-class Campbells have their own melodramas to contend with: Despite being gay, stepson Jodie (Billy Crystal) is an expectant father and moves in with pregnant Carol (Rebecca Balding), and later a lesbian roommate; Mary (Cathryn Damon) suspects Burt (Richard Mulligan) of having an affair; Corrine (Diana Canova) and ex-priest Tim (Sal Viscuso) have a baby that's demonically possessed; and Burt is abducted by aliens!Exorcisms and flying saucers might suggest desperation on the part of writer-creator Susan Harris, but the opposite is true: the controversy that plaguedSoap's first season had subsided (thanks to valiant defense by ABC President Fred Silverman), and Harris and Jay Sandrich (who directed 20 of these 22 episodes) were able to push their spoofy plots to even greater heights of absurdity without sacrificing the show's core integrity. Jimmy Baio (as Billy Tate) gets his moment to shine, and Robert Guillaume (as Benson) deservedly won an Emmy for Best Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series. Most impressively,Soapbuilt its madness upon a solid tragi-comic foundation, with risky shifts of tone and characters invested with surprising depth and compassion. The episodes are consistently full of classic scenes and side-splitting dialogue. In a 20-minute bonus featurette, Harris and coproducers Paul Witt and Tony Thomas reveal how luck, timing, talent, and network support brought the series to life. Simply put, it doesn't get any better than this.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00361XWFA", "B00361XWEQ", "B00361XWFK", "B000Q6GUJS", "B000MEYKA0", "B00008EY6N", "B00LMKKY2Q", "B0002NY8R6", "B0006Q93BU", "B000A0GOP0", "B002PQ7JR4", "B0006N2EZK", "B00HNGC56G", "B000FTC1GW", "B000MXPE6U", "B00ESZZOM2", "B0002PYTD2", "B000MGTQ6G", "B000YGGNGK", "B0025KVNOU", "B005BUA1JY", "B00HRUQB5O", "B0006N2EZA", "B001OXLGK0", "B000291Q3O", "B000EQ46HI", "B0011N19HI", "B000FFJ8BM", "B0000E32X2", "B000LC4Z8K", "B000CNE0SS", "B00EQ2KU7G", "B001RXDLZ0", "B000N6UF10", "B004J713KQ", "B000E33VYU", "B002WN8IR0", "B000FDFSH2", "B003XMKU0W", "B0006IUDYY", "B00004RE45", "B0001NBNIY", "B00006J6XI", "B000MGTQ6Q", "B00IFK7ONI", "B000EXDS02", "B003BGZ618", "B002AT8KBU", "1593936877", "B00GC2KI2U", "B000UX6TL6", "B001N26GSE", "B00000K3U3", "B000CNE0T2", "B00GHH9HW2", "B0007Y08JW", "B005CGI4EG", "B000EXDS34", "B000YKYT1M", "B0001BS3IE", "B000VNMMVG", "B00441GYXS", "B000GTLB6C", "B00DXLO0D6", "B001D2WUDE", "B00006J6XH", "B0016MJ73M", "B00FM4S7P4", "B000BOH990", "B005KK2FTO", "B000BOH98G", "B00D2UMHB0", "B00DJYK1XU", "B00008EYBH", "B000TD2KY2", "B000R7I3YG", "B002PQ7JQU", "B00065GX8C", "B001L1S1R6", "B005GZM0J8", "B000UX6TLG", "B00BM2JVAA", "B000HT38IK", "B002TQKL16", "B000MGBSH6", "B0000AQS8B", "B000BZISRQ", "B0001907BW", "B001BGS17Q", "B00008WJEZ", "B001JFKWE4", "B0001JXP2A", "B00D4ABT8K", "B00DXLO086", "B000AA4KQ0", "B0045HCJKS", "B0000798EY", "B000UAE7DQ", "B000G6BL7O", "B000BOH986"], "bought_together": ["B00361XWEQ", "B00361XWFA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00361XWEQ", "B00361XWFK", "B00361XWFA", "B0016MJ73M"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 102592}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 19.99, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B000255LJ8", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51VRQYPX54L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Soap - The Complete Second Season"}

{"description": "What's scarier than scary kids?Village of the Damnedis the definitive scary-kid classic, a truly unsettling film drawn from John Wyndham's novelThe Midwich Cuckoos. The brilliant opening sequence depicts the sudden and temporary paralysis of a small English hamlet, which is followed by the town's women becoming mysteriously pregnant. The spawn of this occurrence are a dozen eerie, blond-headed children, who are either gifted, evil, or \"the world's new people.\" A splendid outing, not least in the way it catches parental anxiety about this small new stranger in one's home. (It was remade by John Carpenter in 1995.)Children of the Damnedfollows up with a story about six more creepy kids, brought from all over the globe to huddle in a old church in London. An excellent opening half-hour gets bogged down in the movie's global-political ambitions (it's very much a cold war offering), but it has its share of shivery moments--the sight of the six youngsters striding down a London street as though they controlled the world is a chiller. But where's the blond hair? The two films are different in tone;Villagefeels like a fifties sci-fi offering, with an old-school star (George Sanders) and classical style;Childrenis a film of the sixties, with hipper techniques, urban setting, and young actors Ian Hendry and Alan Badel. But both have those damned kids.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783230427", "B000A0GOF0", "B00027JYNK", "B0009X75EC", "B000063UR0", "B007Y1NNAW", "B00LU4URS0", "B0000694WH", "B00005R1O7", "B000AYELJ2", "B00009NHC0", "B0007R4T26", "B005HIBWBG", "B002945DUW", "B000RXVNDI", "B00AEBB8VK", "B00518A70E", "B000UDGOBG", "6305869367", "B0045HCJJE", "B00D9EJFV4", "B00LC4PEZ4", "B00D9EJFZA", "B000G6BLYM", "B001B9ZVVC", "B00005JKFR", "B00000K3U3", "B00005LIRD", "0783116926", "B000EHSVJG", "B00005NSXY", "B000UAFDR0", "B00K6D1S7A", "B000FOPPEC", "B000A0GOEQ", "B000A0GOFA", "B00DZP1C9K", "B000OHZJGO", "B005ETANC2", "B000068TPG", "0991127900", "B000AQKU72", "6305761078", "B0045HCJSA", "B0048O2YWG", "B00DOZNGC2", "B0034PWPHY", "B000C20VNM", "B00KSPST6Y", "B00023P4TM", "B000HT38B2", "B0009X770E", "B00009PY4D", "B000FFJZO2", "B00KIZY0EE", "B00K2CHVSK", "B0000694WM", "B0009X770O", "B000S0GYBG", "B000FVQLKW", "B0013XZ6SY", "B00AEBB94G", "B00009NHBC", "B004X63SCY", "B00KIZYDCI", "B00B94VJYW", "B000062XEY", "B0053TWVDC", "B001BSBBNK", "6305944288", "B00009PY2T", "B001BSBBGC", "B005D0RDKM", "B000BYA5IC", "B00003CXCF", "B000RXVNCO", "B000OHBCI8", "B00009PY4A", "B00009PY38", "B00006SFIT", "B00023P4UQ", "B00027JYLC", "B002TSAAS8", "B00DSAUJ32", "B00465I1BK", "B00005Y6XR", "B00005R1O8", "B00IYJFB2G", "B0045HCJKS", "B0002IQL8K", "B005GPFZEK", "B000TLTCT0", "B000EHSVJ6", "B000HEWEDK", "B00ITZXDDY", "B0000A9GHP", "6305772681", "B00006CXGP", "6305772142", "B0009PLLMC"], "bought_together": ["0783230427"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0783230427", "B00027JYNK", "B0009X75EC", "B000063UR0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 29525}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.05, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00027JYMG", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51SknyPjhrL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Village of the Damned/Children of the Damned"}

{"description": "Season 4 of HBO'sMr. Showis particularly strong, with a number of original ideas and exceptionally funny sketches scattered over all 10 episodes. Stars Bob Odenkirk and David Cross are in good form from the season premiere's opening bit about medical marijuana--specifically, Cross's prescription to help him with the anxiety of working with Odenkirk. The duo also work a comic rivalry theme in a dueling bloopers sketch that includes \"embarrassing\" footage of Odenkirk as a male prostitute and Cross as a wannabe rock star.But the best material is positively surreal, such as aJerry Springer-like talk show taking place on a life raft, and a variation onThe Paper Chasein which a curmudgeonly law professor (Michael McKean), suddenly called away from class after a ritual assault on his students' intelligence, is replaced by a less-articulate tyrant (Odenkirk). Also superb is a politically incorrect piece about two guys vying for a blind woman's affection via competing (and increasingly bizarre) descriptions of a sunset, and the \"501st Olympics,\" pitting the Dalai Lama and his monks against fat kids from a summer camp. Special features include Bob and Dave's not-to-be-missed appearance at aComic Reliefcable special, in which a gullible Odenkirk bares all for the sake of his craft.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00009W8JZ", "B00005Y3ZL", "B00008PHCU", "B00L3PA8P8", "B000RZGHT6", "B000RZIGYA", "B00J48K5IG", "B000M341RS", "B00274SITW", "B0048LPRDC", "1455526304", "0785154620", "B00FXOO1AS", "1416553657", "B0001KL5HQ", "B00JPUUQVE", "0971359784", "0306820307", "B0089BSNVK", "B0089AJELY", "B00C2U6I3Y", "B00009ZPU7", "B009LA4P6U", "B00113YHXG", "B004OOL73W", "B008CYDDWI", "B0002PYS7Y", "B000SULWKO", "B0000E2FLB", "B008412UKA", "B00466H3DG", "B00GUALJUO", "B004ZG5EYC", "B00008EY6Q", "B00A3717C0", "B003O7I6L6", "B00C8CQTJY"], "bought_together": ["B00009W8JZ", "B00005Y3ZL"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000CQQID0", "B00005Y3ZL", "B00009W8JZ", "1455526304"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 137366}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 7.99, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B0002ERXBS", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Q77K46S1L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Mr. Show - The Complete Fourth Season"}

{"description": "Improvised by the cast, shot in black and white, John Cassavetes's first independent feature,Shadows, looked like no other film of its time. Cassavetes, seeking to both deal with social issues and create a new kind of cinema, told a story about a family of black siblings in Manhattan trying to make ends meet. Though it meanders at times, it features the kind of spontaneous emotion Cassavetes most wanted to elicit in his films.A sensation in 1968,Facesearned Oscar nominations for actors Seymour Cassel and Lynn Carlin. Improvised and shot in an edgy, hand-held fashion, the film examines the disintegration of the marriage of a couple in mid-life doldrums. Each seeks solace elsewhere: husband John Marley with prostitute Gena Rowlands, wife Carlin with a free spirit played by Cassel. But neither finds anything approaching the fulfillment they feel is missing from the marriage. Indeed, in Cassavetes's probe of raw emotions, these people discover that, just maybe, the problem lies not with their spouse but with themselves.The long, free-form dramaA Woman Under the Influenceis best appreciated as a good showcase for Rowlands, playing a woman whose sanity literally appears to be shattering as different aspects of her personality eclipse others at various times. Peter Falk plays her struggling, blue-collar husband, trying to understand the phenomenon and sometimes losing his patience. As with most of Cassavetes's works as a director, one can't help but find one's attention drifting in and out, but Rowland's performance is a key reason the film has been declared a \"national treasure\" by the Library of Congress.The title ofThe Killing of a Chinese Bookieis the only commercial element in this fascinating character study by writer-director Cassavetes, who once again finds his cinematic soulmate in actor Ben Gazzara. The film uses verit&#xE9; technique to tell the story of Cosmo Vitelli (Gazzara), a Hollywood strip-club owner whose growing debt to a local gangster can only be erased if he agrees to kill a rival Chinese gangster. As usual, Cassavetes employs his favorite actors (including Seymour Cassel and the fearsome Timothy Carey) and vivid improvisation to giveChinese Bookiea tense atmosphere of emotional urgency.Gena Rowlands stars inOpening Night, Cassavetes's drama of an aging, alcoholic stage actress in the days leading up to her latest Broadway opening. Like all of her collaborations with her writer-director husband, Rowlands is a woman on the verge of collapse, this time a lonely alcoholic whose very life is a performance. Overlong at 144 minutes, the film's long, loose scenes build through uncomfortable small talk and slow, tentative confrontations. Some of the scenes are edgy and thrilling, though many find this facet of Cassavetes pretentious and self-indulgent. Ultimately it's a matter of taste: if you like his style, you'll love this discomforting drama.The eight-disc Criterion Collection set is filled out with the 2000 documentaryA Constant Forge: The Life and Art of John Cassavetes, plus numerous interviews, a second version ofThe Killing of a Chinese Bookie, a commentary track forA Woman Under the Influence, a 68-page book, and various other features.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0024FAG2Q", "0571201571", "B004QB8TGG", "B00005BHW6", "B000WC39FY", "B000LSAIYE", "0780022343", "B00F98FOI6", "B0000A02TX", "B00005QAPH", "B003VA3JTA", "B001LMU19G", "B00HE011DE", "B00DZP1BUU", "B000FUF7CQ", "B0035ECHVI", "B004WPYO7E", "B00004REAG", "B000E5LEV0", "B0026VBOJW", "B00008H2GR", "B00005JKPT", "B00004W3HG", "B004N084S8", "B0007989Y8", "B00CUKTHDO", "B005152C9G", "B00004Z1FM", "B00HVOFP6W", "B00005V6N6", "B001TIQT6Q", "B00GBT637S", "B00065GVI4", "B00005JLV7", "B000YV1Q30", "B00004XQN5", "B003Z3C728", "B00005M2C7", "B000OPPAF6", "B00HVOFP08", "B002AFX53C", "B000K0YLX2", "B00HRISNPM", "B00005BCK0", "B008Y5OVZ8", "B000ZM1MIM", "B0000AKY56", "B005KQVE1S", "B00005UQ7R", "B00GBT62PQ", "B000VARC2S", "078002205X", "B000PKG6O4", "B000OPPADS", "B001LMU1C8", "B000022TS6", "B004ALIG4M", "B000XQ4HQO", "B00005QAPJ", "B000AQKUG8", "0780022076", "B000PKG6OE", "B00GPPXNLC", "B00D6I7EGQ", "B00004W229", "0292776241", "B004B32500", "B00065GX64", "B001BEK8F6", "0780622251", "B00000F17A", "6305081034", "B002IVDLHI", "B007N5YJPC", "B0001GH5TW", "B0006HC0GY", "0780021320", "0792846087", "B000BR6QCI", "B001TIQT6G", "B002U6DVPS", "B003152Z0O", "B00180R072", "B000PKG6OO", "B00005YKXQ", "B0007GAG42", "B00005JKGO", "B0047P5FTA", "B00006RCNV", "B002U6DVPI", "B000NOK0H6", "B000NOK0HG", "B000087EY5", "B000E5LEVA", "B000NY1E9E", "B001D8W7F4", "B002BWP4A6", "B005LOIEM6", "B000XPSC0W", "B004M66YUS"], "bought_together": ["B0024FAG2Q", "B004QB8TGG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001DHXT6G", "B00H9L26AA", "B0024FAG2Q", "B00012QM8G"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 104098}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 68.99, "brand": "Image Entertainment", "asin": "B0002JP2OS", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51SSOp84cDL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "John Cassavetes: Five Films (Shadows / Faces / A Woman Under the Influence / The Killing of a Chinese Bookie / Opening Night ) (The Criterion Collection)"}
{"description": "There will be a debate of which 2004 DVD collection of Marx Brothers films was better. This Universal release of the better known Paramount-produced films are the only ones starring all four brothers: Groucho, Chico, Harpo, and Zeppo. TheWarner collectioncontains less-vital films, but is loaded with extras and commentaries. The Universal collection contains only 20 minutes of interviews from NBC'sToday Show--interesting but short--with Harpo, Groucho, and Harpo's son Bill from the '60s and '70s. All of the films in this collection were released on DVD by Image Entertainment in 2000 and the prints look the same, which isn't necessarily bad; one just wishes a major restoration had been undertaken.The films--packaged handsomely with a booklet--are essential Marx Brothers, their first five films made from 1929 to 1933. The least timeless is their first,The Cocoanuts, based on their Broadway hit. The film--one of the first full talkies--takes place in a hotel with owner Groucho out to grab every dollar.Animal Crackersis the brothers' first classic, a lickety-split comedy about an art theft being investigated by Groucho's alter-image, Captain Spaulding. For introducing youngsters to the work of Marx,Monkey Businessis the best way. The shenanigans start right at the start as the brothers stowaway on a luxury liner. It's their first film that wasn't based on a play, as they endeavored to find new material.Horse Feathersgave them more fertile ground plus a sure-fire Hollywood director at the helm (Norman McLeoad). Their fantasia of college life includes the riotous football-game finale. Music, always a key part of their plays and films is given more weight here and includes Groucho's theme, \"I'm Against It.\" Music is again key as the musicals of the era are spoofed in the brothers' undisputed masterpiece,Duck Soup. From a land called Fredonia, Groucho plays a slapdash ruler who rewrites the rules of governing, leading to a most memorable war with Sylvania (so war gets lampooned. too).Duck Soupalso boasts the most famous Marx brothers sketch: Groucho trying to fool his mirror.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0001HAIP4", "B00BY0EBDC", "B002TSAAAG", "B0001HAINQ", "B002ID099O", "B000LC4C0Q", "B0002KGXZO", "0879100362", "B000E6ESX0", "B00ILGPI9I", "B004P9UWM8", "B0000WN0PA", "B006WN5W5M", "B004P9UWL4", "B00006SFJ7", "0306806665", "B00JRHW4GK", "B000SSQ7JW", "B00406UJZG", "B0001FGBZW", "B00008ZZ7B", "B001FD6MJO", "B0002HS738", "B0001HAIMW", "B00KIZY3XW", "B005BYBZKY", "B00BX49C3S", "0517515466", "B00143XDYM", "0783228457", "B004P9UWLY", "B005DDN51A", "B0001JXP2A", "B003ZYU3T6", "1416536035", "B008FYZHHE", "B0024FAG1C", "B00005UMFC", "B005F265CU", "B004NWPXZS", "B00406UJWE", "B00000ILEU", "B0045HCJHG", "B0000648YD", "B000TXP56M", "B008M4C1BC", "B0081NAVGG", "B00CHMBQCU", "B001AXL67W", "B00005RDRL", "B005F265IE", "B000B5XORU", "B00A04YHI2", "B0007939MK", "B001EXE2Y2", "B0009W5J6E", "0783225903", "B00ESZZOLI", "B00006RCNV", "B0000BV1XX", "B007N31YH0", "B00023P4O2", "B002VWNIAY", "B000N3T0H8", "B002GSXKPQ", "B00AEFYR9G", "B00EO2I6RO", "B001B23ED6", "B00518A70E", "B007FQXEVY", "B0072BNJZ8", "B000E33W26", "B00J2PQZEY", "B0007ZEO8C", "B004UOHNH0", "B004GJYR7I", "B00IF0KASY", "B00CVB6XF2", "B00008RH3L", "B00005JKF6", "B0002AHW3G", "B00AMDA2OY", "B005EVY8MQ", "B00D9EJFZA", "B001E18222", "B0036FJ6OM", "B000E8JO32", "B000HT3PF6", "B0090XLDKY", "B000WGYMB0", "B00E44EZUE", "B000A1INJE", "B00005QEO0", "B00BY8DAAE", "B001IHJ988", "B001KXZGNW", "B00151QYYE", "B0009S4J3M", "B007REV4LQ", "B00004R99Y"], "bought_together": ["B0001HAIP4", "B00BY0EBDC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0001HAIP4", "B004P9UWM8", "B002TSAAAG", "B0001HAINQ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 36968}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 37.78, "brand": "UNI DIST CORP.

{"description": "With its campy combination of lightweight adventure and Spandex disco chic,Buck Rogers in the 25th Centuryis a nostalgic throwback to post-Star Warsopportunism. Series co-creator Glen A. Larson was incapable of originality, and former soap star Gil Gerard (in the title role) was a bland incarnation of the comic-strip hero, so the much-anticipated series premiered on September 20, 1979, with serious disadvantages. Although the two-hour pilot \"Awakening\" had tested successfully as a theatrical release, Gerard and the show's producers could never agree on a stable tone for the series, which presents Capt. William \"Buck\" Rogers as a jovial space cowboy who is accidentally time-warped from 1987 to 2491. Earth is engaged in interplanetary war following a global holocaust, and Buck's piloting skills make him an ideal starfighter recruit for the Earth Defense Directorate, where his closest colleagues are Dr. Huer (Tim O'Connor), squadron leader Col. Wilma Deering (former model Erin Gray, looking oh-so-foxy), the wisecracking robot Twiki (voiced by cartoon legend Mel Blanc), and a portable computer-brain named Dr. Theopolis, who's carried by Twiki like oversized bling-bling.The series struggled through an awkward first season, with routine plots elevated by decent special effects and noteworthy guest stars including Jamie Lee Curtis, ill-fatedPlayboyPlaymate Dorothy Stratten (appearing, with her voice dubbed over, less than a year before her tragic murder),Batmanalumnus Julie Newmar, Buster Crabbe (veteran of vintageBuck Rogersmovie serials), and several others in a show that favored vamps and vixens over credible science fiction. A full-scale overhaul resulted in a disastrous second season, but devoted fans still gravitate to Hawk (Thom Christopher), the charismatic alien \"birdman\" who was introduced with new characters and a new, space-faring search for lost tribes from Earth (with echoes of Larson's ownBattlestar Galactica). Behind-the-scenes squabbles continued, and by mid-season of 1981, NBC pulled the plug on a breezy, still-engaging series that suffered from uneasy chemistry and never realized its full potential. Existing somewhere betweenGalacticaandLost in Spacein the TV sci-fi food chain, thisBuck--with a dearth of DVD extras--now functions as a cheesy stroll down memory lane.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000W4KT9G", "B00GX7D5G0", "B003BGZ61S", "B000PFUAN2", "B006MFQ4OS", "B0000AFX64", "B001SGN1JM", "B00023BKMC", "B00005JOJP", "B00F3L8P26", "B000JLTRHW", "B00005B8UD", "B0009JE6FM", "B00BHLTIXQ", "B004EXWGJW", "B000067FP2", "B000HEWEJ4", "B005DGKBDC", "B004EXWGHY", "B00404ME2E", "B000BOH8Y6", "B003XMKU3Y", "B0009JE6G6", "B0001ZMWYG", "B0001I55SS", "B005GYXO8K", "B003H9LIU2", "B001DW2BG0", "B005UL4NH0", "B008H6GHII", "B0012IXBNC", "B000X07SQ6", "B0090F6SD4", "B002ZCY872", "B003CNQPNS", "B004VT9JLM", "B00E5G03I4", "B0006Z2KZ2", "B0007YMWGY", "B00466H3A4", "B00144P9RA", "B003W5C0TY", "B001RTCP1U", "B00264QI68", "B001CQONOA", "B0013LL2Z2", "B0002IQKAY", "B0006D3HE2", "B000PFUA9Q", "B00A04YHI2", "B003NH3X5Q", "B000BCCAEQ", "B000WLU5ZM", "B005LFQRTC", "B002KVSJ6O", "B000ELL1QC", "B006LPHY6G", "B002VA5A02", "B005G5NPD8", "B00CWX1HPA", "B0014BQR3I", "B005DKS1Z8", "B000SNUR34", "B001ECDVH2", "B000V5IP6K", "B005GYXN2M", "B001QE99BA", "B0000C23T1", "B008R65XN8", "B0049IHWYG", "B004M9ZI0C", "B00DYQ1GBE", "B000B8IA3U", "B000F7CMPE", "B002VA59ZS", "B000ION23U", "B001AQO43M", "B00080ZG2E", "B000N4RAQA", "B004VT9JMG", "B004UV3KS4", "B00005JNU5", "B003ES5JDI", "B0011FLGZQ", "B0038ZITIE", "B000TSTEMS", "B003XMKU0M", "B0001I55O2", "B000WTZ6SK", "B0036EH3UC", "B00BUDDMGU", "B001DHXT6G", "B0006UEVTA", "B00096S47G", "B00D9EJFZA", "B005EVY8NA", "B002OKK2AW", "B0014BQR38", "B000BR9SA0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005UL4NH0", "B0090F6SD4", "B00GX7D5G0", "B003BGZ61S"]}, "price": 12.98, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 31335}, "asin": "B0002MHDW4", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51FE0EDQARL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Buck Rogers in the 25th Century: The Complete Epic Series"}
{"description": "Four years after Showtime made gay men the focus of its original seriesQueer as Folk, it was time for a little turnabout withThe L&#xA0;Word(bad title, great show). Centering around a tight-knit group of lesbians in Los Angeles, this drama was far removed from its working-class male counterpart in both style and content. While the men ofQAFenjoyed a fabulous if melodramatic life on the middle-class streets of Pittsburgh, the women ofThe L&#xA0;Wordlived it up in sunny California, with gorgeous houses, glamorous careers, and sexy wardrobes. Ironically, though,The L&#xA0;Wordadhered more to the everyday drama of ensemble shows likethirtysomethingthan the soap opera antics ofQAF, and the results were surprisingly heartfelt and effective, appropriately stylish but never over the top. There was plenty of room for titillation, but creator Ilene Chaiken fashioned from the start a show centered on characters and not just sex, aiming for the heart rather than... well, other places.The L&#xA0;Wordfocused primarily on committed couple Bette (Jennifer Beals) and Tina (Laurel Holloman), a former power-career duo who've decided to have a baby; however, artificial insemination and the changing dynamics of their relationship throw their previously happy existence off-kilter.

Jenny's am-I-straight-or-not? kvetching frustrated both her fianc&#xE9; (Eric Mabius) and many viewers, who were alternately irritated and intrigued by her inability to decide one way or the other. But Jenny's weakness was part ofThe L&#xA0;Word's strength: in exploring many sides of many issues, both domestic and political, it never came up with an easy answer for any of them, making the show all that more fascinating--and compulsively watchable.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0009QTRVI", "B000GTJSO4", "B000TGJ8D0", "B001BN4WMC", "B001G0MFOM", "B00002CGGH", "B003YJFALI", "B00005RIY5", "B00HW3EXCE", "B000J4QWIG", "B003L77GTC", "B00166UFSY", "B005FLSZHY", "B001AQBGM4", "B005JZBPHS", "B004YM6JSW", "B004BJMEO6", "B009TE9GNK", "B008XAGN46", "B0000798EY", "B00827OWO8", "B000Q6GUKW", "B002AMVED8", "B001G0MFD8", "B000FFJYE8", "0743291336", "B00264H48E", "B003FSTN8O", "B00AFDN5Y0", "B00079FUI6", "B003L77GEM", "B00J49R0ZQ", "B00008AOX3", "B001GCUBS2", "B004EI2NM2", "B001EHDSPW", "B004N21KIC", "1573441996", "B000NA1PUG", "B003FSTN4S", "B006HAJBHA", "B00005JO9J", "0316009857", "B0001O3YLM", "B001AQR39O", "B005HMHPE0", "B001EHDSPM", "B0007DBJG4", "B000P6YNTI", "B0018CWEVW", "B003LXM1PK", "B00BI9VRYK", "B000F3UA6Q", "B0013ZGN9I", "B00FRTAZEA", "B00175G7CW", "B000QUTTPG", "B001OQCVFG", "B001QE99AQ", "B00HUCF7AO", "B002BAW6I6", "B000051XVX", "B008YRL6LI", "B000FUTVLO", "B000Q6GUW0", "B0012BS5XU", "B000FIMG5Y", "B00070EBS0", "B0002234R2", "B000E3L7F0", "B005SEDI5M", "B006CR2PAI", "B001EWDXT8", "B001VPJZ0E", "B000E5N684", "B00DYZ80S2", "B00008ZL4Q", "B000R7HRRA"], "bought_together": ["B0009QTRVI", "B000GTJSO4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005JZBPHS", "B0009QTRVI", "B000GTJSO4", "B001G0MFOM"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 35696}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 17.96, "brand": "Paramount", "asin": "B0002MPQRS", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516HWGKX5VL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The L Word: Season 1"}

{"description": "The vampiric Stephen King tale returns to the small screen, 25 years after the first made-for-TVSalem's Lot, a Tobe Hooper-directed ratings hit. This time it's Rob Lowe as a successful writer who returns to his haunted hometown. As a kid, something awful happened to him in the spooky mansion on the hill; now that he's back, the mansion is once again buzzing with evil portents. The physical production (shot in Australia) is convincing, and it's fun to see old pros such as Donald Sutherland, Rutger Hauer, and James Cromwell cutting up in juicy roles. The storytelling, however, feels oddly disjointed, as though King's sprawl had been arbitrarily hacked away rather than adapted (a few big moments are bewilderingly left offscreen). The approach misses the basic assets of a vampire story:  the disbelief, the lore, the sex appeal. Instead, it feels like a random collection of bits for short attention spans.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B003L2M584", "0790742829", "B00IYJRIKO", "B006J8NPAE", "B000G1R39E", "B000077VRT", "B00000F3SB", "B000GYI340", "1573625779", "B0000C2IQQ", "B00BW4S8AC", "B000063US5", "B0007WFXNA", "0792841328", "6305645574", "6305120021", "B00005UQ9V", "B000053UIF", "B00006FDCD", "B000068IES", "B00AEBB91E", "B00AEBB91O", "B0007NFMB2", "B0033HKCV4", "B000U1ZV6W", "B00BW4S87U", "0767821599", "B00L8QOZK6", "B00009OWI3", "B00BTYPW7C", "B00LNBQ8SI", "B00AEFXR8I", "1573626910", "B002NZK5SM", "B0001FVDQ4", "B0002A2VK0", "B0010X73ZG", "B000FDFWYG", "B005CFBZVG", "B00BW4S89S", "B00005O439", "B000TJ6PBK", "B0002O7XW2", "B002VWNIDG", "0792846443", "B00005JOJE", "B00DII0MGI", "B00IKM5LXG", "0307743675", "6304936397", "B00005LQ0Q", "B00L4K3MLE", "B000GBEWRU", "B004SEUJL4", "B0053TWV46", "B00KUS5YGC", "B00AEFYV9W", "B00A1AU72A", "B008QE9Z8A", "B00K2CHWYI", "6302814731", "078062856X", "B00030AZCK", "B000H4JH7Q", "B00006FDCU", "B0053TWVDC", "B00IJS2OXG", "B00D49YFAA", "6304604572", "B0052XU4BK", "B00009QG7O", "B00KYCA4QY", "B001CFEBW0", "6305258287", "B00023P4TM", "B00GNAO70K", "B00BEIYMAG", "B00005K3NR", "B0013LL2YS", "B005CFBZWK", "B00003CXCF", "B0051CSIKQ", "B0000AOX09", "0385182449", "1613470541", "B007XF0W3K", "B00009PY32", "6305106959", "B00FXOO1VC", "B000RZIGUE", "B00004TS0G", "B0017IVHHO", "1476754454", "B000069I05", "630523650X", "B003R0MEYA", "B003EYVXYG", "B0002234LS", "B000AA4JNO"], "bought_together": ["0790742829"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00IYJRIKO", "0790742829", "B00BW4S8AC", "B008QE9Z8A"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 50637}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.35, "brand": "Turner Home Ent", "asin": "B0002OXVG4", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51R2b7emk0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Salem's Lot - The Miniseries"}
{"description": "The rough-edged vitality of contemporary Irish filmmaking is readily apparent inIntermission, a deliriously ambitious black comedy in which 54 characters and 11 plotlines compete for consistently impressive screen-time. In a dazzling display of audacity, screenwriter Mark O'Rowe and first-time director John Crowley jump from one plot to another, tangling their characters in an infectious series of intersecting events, shifting from scenes of brutal violence, poignant compassion, and richly dark humor, and somehow managing to make it all fit together in a miraculously coherent tapestry of romance, crime, and authentic Dublin atmosphere. Colin Farrell andStar Trek: Deep Space Ninealumnus Colm Meaney are the familiar stars here, and they're in peak form on native soil, but the entire cast shines in equal measure, all of them playing malcontents striving for something better in a world that's simultaneously harsh and hilarious.

{"description": "Mike Hodges and Clive Owen, director and star of the stylish 1998 crime dramaCroupier, team again in this moody, almost contemplative thriller about a former gangster, Will Graham (Owen), who returns to London after a lengthy self-exile. In a tragic coincidence, Will's brother, Davey (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers), has just committed suicide following a rape by a wealthy car dealer (Malcolm McDowell). Convinced there is more to Davey's death than meets the eye, Will--arguing he is nothing like his old, violent, urban self--slowly evolves again into a formidable criminal. Hodges and screenwriter Trevor Preston emphasize tone and spiritual inference over precise character motivation. Not everything that can be known about Will (especially his rocky psychological state and history with a former lover, played by Charlotte Rampling) is expressly stated. But one can feel his stifled nature rising, paradoxically, toward revenge, and his final actions have an existential power and mystery.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0001BKACG", "B001KEHAEE", "B005TTEFZ8", "076782153X", "B00080ZHD2", "B00005UW73", "B005M2AKJW", "B000FO0AD8", "B0030Y11T2", "B00020VZTS", "B000GIXLXE", "B000EQHXNW", "B000255LIY", "B000RIWAVC", "0783241909", "B004U7MR4G", "B00C7T0EPS", "B002ZG97O2", "B004O8OLO0", "B004SEUIU6", "B004XNNUZ2", "B000E5KURY", "B004499LX0", "B000HRMAPE", "B0006FO8E8", "B000MGB6NM", "B000291Q52", "B00GTZWVXE", "B006MQ0ERK", "B00133KFGW", "B00CX7OWWA", "B00FRQ0HOQ", "B000CBCWIK", "B0050ODZ6M", "B00IKM5NJS", "B0000UJLF0", "B00005B20H", "B00009QGA7", "B000GFLKF8", "B007RFJCN2", "B007CEFTSA", "B00HGBAG5K", "B0000UJL82", "B0007R4TJ4", "B00008R9KB", "B00005JM2Y", "B000P2A2WY", "B00HUCF420", "B000E6ESKS", "B001G9CNI6", "B00121QGPY", "0790729407", "B006ISJQ26", "B0042RJWTC", "B00BNWWVFG", "B00BTYU3W6", "B00GD7UO6E", "B00BQXTCVS", "B0002I8372", "B000CQLZ0Q", "B0041SI798", "B005NHZALE", "B00GOHZLDO", "B001BNFRB2", "B00GJNQ4B6", "B001RXDM2M", "B004XNNV2Y", "B00AATGDUC", "B001G6E7N8", "0767833600", "B0011VJRVU", "B000XUF6B0", "B000KJU18C", "B0013D8LC2", "B00GHP8SH4", "B00H9KKGTO", "B0062P3392", "B00DU22OI6", "B0083HXKAY", "B001CC7PLM", "B002AT8KAG", "B000ZS8GW6", "B000TGJ81M", "B0016MJ6HY", "B00005R87B", "6305428085", "B009WGYXIS", "B0015XHQTY", "B000092T3P", "B00005JN2Z", "B00BEIYKM6", "B009R8Q8Y8", "B000FOPPBA", "B0060ZJ7DA", "B000N6TX1I", "B009AMAKWM", "B0002YLCG0", "B00388PK7O", "B005K8QIS0"], "bought_together": ["B0001BKACG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0001BKACG", "B001KEHAEE", "B00133KFGW", "B0002YLCG0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 248856}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.8, "brand": "", "asin": "B0002WZTJS", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51546K1RQFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "I'll Sleep When I'm Dead"}

Not a happy place, obviously, and it gets worse when both men realize that they've been chained and pitted against one another by an unseen but apparently omniscient maniac who's screwing with their psyches as payment for past sins. Director James Wan, who concocted this grimy distraction with screenwriter Whannell, has seenSevenand any number of other arty existential-psycho-cat-and-mouse thrillers, so he's providedSawwith a little flash, a little blood, and a lot of ways to distract you from the fact that it doesn't make a whole hell of a lot of sense. Wan and Whannell (who's not the most accomplished actor, either) pile on the plot twists, which after some initially novel ideas become increasingly juvenile. Elwes works hard but looks embarrassed, and the estimable Danny Glover suffers as the obsessed detective on the case.

{"description": "The single-disc edition ofI Heart Huckabeeshas two commentary tracks: the first is writer-director David O. Russell on his own, providing a more low-key assessment of the film and the Buddhist philosophical endeavors that inspired it; he's not the raving lunatic that Sharon Waxman's scathing 2004 profile inThe New York Timeswould lead you to believe. The second commentary, with Russell and his primary cast, is much more of a party-like romp, strictly optional but entertaining for anyone curious about anecdotes from a production that was apparently a lot of fun.

{"description": "In addition to inspiring a college drinking game that's never gone out of style,The Bob Newhart Showgave one of America's greatest stand-up comedians a perfect sitcom showcase. This wasn't Newhart's first TV show (following the success of his comedy albums, he hosted a short-lived variety show in 1961-62), but it was the first to transfer his wry, inimitable wit to an effective alter ego, and as mild-mannered psychologist Bob Hartley, 43-year-old Newhart found a sublime character conduit for stone-faced sarcasm that was biting but never malicious.Watch our exclusive interviewwith Bob Newhart:high bandwidthorlow bandwidthLiving in a Chicago high-rise with Emily, his wife of three years and a third-grade schoolteacher (played with underrated smartness by Suzanne Pleshette), 40-year-old Bob divides his time equally between happy (but not too happy) domesticity and time at the office, where he employs a feisty and frequently lovelorn receptionist Carol (Marcia Wallace, who later enjoyed a thriving career providing voices forThe Simpsonsand other animated shows) who also works for Jerry (Peter Bonerz, who became a respected TV director), a bachelor dentist and Bob's best friend.The first season (of six, on CBS until August 1978) offered the same high quality asThe Mary Tyler Moore Show(also produced by Moore's MTM Enterprises) and established many of the memorable characters who contributed to the show's enduring greatness. Bill Daily (late ofI Dream of Jeannie) would thrive as the Hartley's divorced neighbor Howard (his uninvited \"Hi Bob!\" intrusions inspired that infamous drinking game), while married neighbor Margaret (Patricia Smith) would disappear by season's end. Among Bob's hilarious group-therapy patients, the miserable misanthrope Mr. Carlin (Jack Riley) was a comedic goldmine as the series progressed, but it's Newhart's own comic genius--including his perfected phone-call routines and deadpan reactions to everyday dilemmas--that remained the show's greatest asset. These 24 first-season episodes are remarkably consistent under the direction (mostly) of sitcom veterans Jay Sandrich and Alan Rafkin, and guest stars include Penny Marshall, Louise Lasser, Allen Garfield, Chuck McCann, and a host of other '70s TV stalwarts, all meshing nicely with one of TV's funniest ensemble casts. --Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00GHH9HW2", "B00HNGC56G", "B000A9QKSM", "B000E6ES9Y", "B00JHH1VUU", "B000G6BL7O", "B00005JLIC", "B006VC3LDO", "B00HRUQB5O", "B00096S480", "B000Z27H8Q", "B000NTMA1U", "B000G6BLDI", "B000F8O2MO", "B0002NY8R6", "B004ES6TBS", "B00GOC74QG", "B000MXPE6U", "B00EQ2KU7G", "B000BOH8YQ", "B002WN8IR0", "B00IFK7ONI", "B000MGBSH6", "B00KO72X4K", "B003VTKZ84", "B00H8KC1N4", "B00005JOXR", "B000291Q3O", "B0006N2EZA", "B00KYCA4QY", "B00005JOEB", "B0006N2EZK", "B00GOC74I4", "B0006TPE1U", "B000M343AS", "B000BGR1B4", "B000068V9X", "B00008EY6N", "B002PQ7JR4", "B000EXDS02", "B000A0GOP0", "B000FTC1GW", "B00096S45S", "B001OXLGK0", "B000LXGXY8", "B0030U1TCK", "B0002NY8PI", "B000FSMEB0", "B0011N19HI", "B0025KVNOU", "B00009VRF0", "B001Q9E9KG", "B00D2UMHB0", "B0001NBNJ8", "B001NPK5BU", "B000A0GOQ4", "B00E96AWY0", "B00GLT2SOA", "B00IFK7OFG", "B0000V4906", "B003RHZ6CK", "B00005JMHI", "B0000BV1XX", "B00JDCP0QA", "B002E58FT2", "B000N2HD6O", "B00BHWG0N6", "B001JFKWE4", "B000T22PVG", "B005DCJ0Q0", "B000EQ5PTQ", "B000EXZFS0", "B000YGGNGK", "B000E3L7EQ", "B000BF0C8E", "B0007WFY4S", "B0002W4SWW", "B0001DMXEC", "B0085Z6ZD8", "B00HW3LG3S", "B00008EYBH", "B0012EM5E2", "B0012EM5DS", "B000CCBCCG", "B0001Z3I1C", "B00I458456", "B002XKKX8E", "B001O4KBNM", "B0002NY81C", "B00008NV4G", "B0007OCG74", "B0085Z6YYI", "B00A2XQTF0", "B00FM4S7P4", "B0011FLGYM", "B002ACKBTG", "B001D5C1EY", "B00KTFJ7UA", "B0089BSLKS", "B00DICPAMU"], "bought_together": ["B00GHH9HW2", "B00HNGC56G"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00GHH9HW2", "B00HNGC56G", "B00HRUQB5O", "B00JHH1VUU"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 23588}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 17.97, "brand": "NEWHART,BOB", "asin": "B0007IO6PA", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51JFG6YMC7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Bob Newhart Show - The Complete First Season"}

A wonderfully haunting score, starkly beautiful imagery, and a labyrinthine plot that twists and turns at every dark corner all set the stage for a riveting and often terrifying guessing game of a movie.

{"description": "Fans of Christina Ricci will note that the saucer-eyed actress takes a big leap from deadpan-child and grumpy-ingenue roles withProzac Nation, an adaptation of Elizabeth Wurtzel's bestselling book. Ricci puts her all into playing Lizzie, a self-absorbed Ivy League writer wannabe who alienates friends and family with her out-of-control mood swings and other chemical imbalances. Ricci is committed and convincing, but nothing she does ameliorates Lizzie's exasperating personality; spending 90 minutes around this person is an eternity of tantrums. Around to provide audience stand-ins are Jason Biggs, Michelle Williams, and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, all of whom disapprove of Lizzie's self-destructive behavior. Jessica Lange, professional as always, is Lizzie's brittle mother. If the movie really did capture the sense of the zeitgeist suggested by its grandiose title, or if it carried some intriguing stylistic urgency that carried us into its depressive labyrinth, perhaps Lizzie's journey would be palatable. But the long delay betweenProzac Nation's shooting (in 2001) and its emergence on cable-TV and DVD is all too easy to understand.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B003IY498Y", "B00AEFXJ86", "B000HC2M0C", "0767821009", "B00003CWQR", "B004P7CN3G", "B00008Z463", "B0004Z3242", "B00AEFXJ1I", "B00005JLD1", "1573229628", "B003IY49K2", "B00005JMON", "B000092T3X", "076782153X", "B00ET2ODTE", "B00DW5IKYS", "B00JJ3EHCG", "B00EMAGKNU", "B00013RC2K", "B000FO0AD8", "B000021Y7L", "B00005UW73", "B004U7MR4G", "B001KEHAEE", "B005TTEFZ8", "B004OUZLGK", "B000GIXLXE", "B006Z7Z3VS", "B0037QGS0A", "B001URA5Y8", "B00020VZTS", "B00080ZHD2", "B00005QJIG", "B0083QN87K", "B000JBXXYK", "B00C7T0EPS", "0780625528", "B000TLTCQI", "B001CRC4DG", "B00005R87R", "B000255LIY", "B000BBOUUE", "B000DZ8540", "B000BX8R10", "B009M4KTUG", "B001URA5XY", "B000FIHN5M", "B00005JKJG", "B005Z9MGRG", "B006M3M5FM", "B00005Q4CS", "B00023P4I8", "076782170X", "B0030BOCMS", "B000F7CEC0", "B004SUDQDQ", "B007CEFTSA", "B00G5GNZ78", "B00EVU3T26", "B000F0UUD2", "0743223314", "B006ZGROB6", "B000089798", "B008NA3I30", "B005M2AKJW", "B009L79YRI", "B002ZG97O2", "B0029Z8K74", "B001C5LLVE", "B00BTYXNPK", "B00CPTUO1Y", "B000PKG8TM", "B0040J1RX6", "B00GPPXNIK", "B0006FO8E8", "B005M2AKLK", "B00375LBKI", "B0045HCIYA", "B00DVD5SBE", "B006GL8NQ0", "B00E8G5HXM", "B004XNNUZ2", "B002Q3MZXE", "B00I208ZHA", "B00005JMIJ", "B00005T30L", "B00003CXK7", "B00HW3EJ6Y", "0783241909", "B00AY6PK5A", "B0020LH8WU", "B00ET2ODU8", "B00C68SIUS", "B00068S3WS", "B00817TUVO", "B000LAZDPG", "B009OCR2U6", "B000022TSK", "B000PHX5MS"], "bought_together": ["B00AEFXJ86", "B003IY498Y"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AEFXJ86", "B003IY498Y", "B00003CWQR", "B000HC2M0C"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 118534}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 20.15, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B00094ASC2", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51M300CS04L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Prozac Nation"}

{"description": "Will Smith's easygoing charm makesHitchthe kind of pleasant, uplifting romantic comedy that you could recommend to almost anyone--especially if there's romance in the air. As suave Manhattan dating consultant Alex \"Hitch\" Hitchens, Smith plays up the smoother, sophisticated side of his established screen persona as he mentors a pudgy accountant (Kevin James) on the lessons of love. The joke, of course, is that Hitch's own love life is a mess, and as he coaches James toward romance with a rich, powerful, and seemingly inaccessible beauty named Allegra (Amber Valetta), he's trying too hard to impress a savvy gossip columnist (Eva Mendes) with whom he's fallen in love. Through mistaken identities and mismatched couples, director Andy Tennant brings the same light touch that made Drew Barrymore'sEver Afterso effortlessly engaging. As romantic comedies go,Hitchdoesn't offer any big surprises, but as a date movie it gets the job done with amiable ease and style.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0009RCPUW", "B001QERPAC", "B0013J55B6", "B000N6U0E2", "B0001Z3TXE", "B00005JN0T", "B0013FDM7E", "B00AEFY99O", "B003Y5H4ZW", "B000VXWX7E", "B002K0WBXW", "B000803BQC", "B000BKVQS4", "B000HT386M", "B003Y5H574", "0800141741", "6305428115", "B00007E2F5", "B00005JMW7", "B00AEBB9WI", "B00008G8M4", "B002VECM6S", "B000LC3ICE", "B000ELJAEM", "B00003CXSM", "B004EPZ0BG", "B00AEBB8NS", "076780421X", "B00164KYV4", "B00AEFY0F2", "B003Y5H524", "B000VG66XS", "B00008WJD6", "B00AEFXWXI", "B002ZG998G", "B002ZG989G", "B000YDBPAM", "B000CEV3KU", "B00005JPE3", "B000AP04FG", "B00005JLQN", "B001C5LLQ4", "B00003CXO1", "B002P413IC", "B0001AVZA8", "B0012KJ0DK", "B0015I2RT8", "B000E6EHE0", "B001NPD9RM", "B00008VFCA", "B00006ZXSL", "B000FGGWGK", "B000098XQ8", "B001OQCUZM", "B000MQC9H4", "B00005JN3W", "B00005IBN0", "B003BV8ICC", "B00006FMUW", "B001SN78JO", "B000RBA6C4", "B0009UZGIM", "B001GKJ2E8", "B00005JNTU", "B000ZBEOEC", "B00AEFY4CG", "B0000B1OFL", "B008RNYMG0", "B0038N9WKU", "B0021L8UYY", "B000683VI4", "6304765266", "B000TZJBPQ", "B00005JLSB", "B0007PLLBU", "B000059TG6", "B002ZG9968", "B003EYVXXC", "B0000897EG", "B00005JM4Q", "B004IK30MI", "B00081U7HC", "B002ZG97B0", "B000P0J0EW", "B00005O5CM", "B005F2JRUC", "B000ASDFGI", "B00005JKCH", "B0006GAI5U", "B0000AKCKI", "B001UV4XRY", "B00005JMQW", "B0010X5X4O", "B000M341QE", "B001AKTZW8", "B00024JC4E", "B00AEBB8R4", "B00005JKMQ", "B00CLSBNNM", "B005LAII2Q"], "bought_together": ["B000N6U0E2", "B001QERPAC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000N6U0E2", "B002ZG97TW", "B002VECM6S", "B000AP04FG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 105544}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.94, "brand": "SMITH,WILL", "asin": "B000957O7S", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41jGu0AHCAL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Hitch (Fullscreen Edition)"}
{"description": "My stars! The first, and perhaps most magical, season ofBewitchedstill casts an enchanting spell. For escapist fantasy, this series, no doubt inspired by the playBell, Book and Candle, broke significant television ground. The Stephens were sitcoms' first mixed marriage. Advertising executive Darrin Stephens (Dick York) was mortal, and wife Samantha (Elizabeth Montgomery) was a witch. According to a retrospective segment included on this four-disc set, the Stephenses were also the first couple to sleep in one bed! And Samantha's mother, Endora (the venerable Agnes Morehead), and father, Maurice (Maurice Evans, most popularly known as Dr. Zaius in the originalPlanet of the Apes, were TV's first separated couple. Surely, Darrin did for advertising what Dick Van Dyke's Rob Petrie did for comedy writing. And nose-twitching Samantha certainly gave Mary Tyler Moore's Laura Petrie a run for the money in the sexy suburbanite sweepstakes. This high-concept series' saving grace was that Darrin insisted that Samantha not engage in any \"hocus-pocus.\" But in this first season, she would be compelled to use her extraordinary powers to right social wrongs (such as derogatory-witch stereotypes in the Halloween episode \"The Witches Are Out\"), champion the underdog (a lonely boy whose overprotective mother won't let him play baseball in \"Little Pitchers Have Big Fears\"), or to restore a troubled boy's Christmas spirit (\"A Vision of Sugar Plums\"). Or, she might just want to turn the tables on an insulting former girlfriend of Darrin's (the pilot, \"Darrin, Take This Witch, Samantha\").York and Montgomery had palpable chemistry. They also received able support by a stellar ensemble of character actors. Alice Pearce and Marion Lorne would earn Emmys for their signature roles as busybody neighbor Mrs. Kravitz and dotty Aunt Clara, respectively. George Tobias portrayed oblivious. long-suffering Abner Kravitz, with David White as Darrin's boss, Larry Tate. In today's more PC climate,Bewitchedmay offend the \"banHarry Potter\" crowd. But for baby boomers especially, this inaugural set will happily conjure up vintage television memories.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000ASDFIQ", "B000E3L7FK", "B000HIVIOM", "B000PISZ86", "B0014FAIYS", "B001LRTT30", "B00280QNKG", "B000E33VZ4", "B000HEZEYG", "B000FI8MQG", "B000RXZL0E", "B0006Z2L4W", "B0007V6IWQ", "B00LT1JKN2", "B000KLQUSK", "B00DXLO0D6", "B000TD48SI", "B0009B16TY", "B000E3L7EQ", "B00DXLO086", "B0000V4906", "B0050MB5AC", "B000291Q3Y", "B001BN4WHW", "B00A2L1CKO", "B000A0GORS", "B0009I7NH6", "B0072BNJ0I", "B0006BAWSI", "B000ASDFGI", "B000B5XOUM", "B000FSMEB0", "B008KZX7W0", "B00005JOEB", "B0006TPE1U", "B00005JLIC", "B00A2L1CJK", "B0002NY8PI", "B000291Q3O", "B000CCBCHQ", "B0007KIFK0", "B00009VRF0", "B0002I837M", "B000BITV1A", "B000EQ5PTQ", "B001E6JC30", "B000EXZFS0", "B000YKYT1M", "B00005JNS8", "B0009OUBPQ", "B000BT96OG", "B0000DFZ5O", "B0063FGERO", "B002E58FT2", "B000EQ45BU", "B00HVFA36I", "B00JU3S6IQ", "B002AMVEHY", "B001LM64VK", "B001N26GSE", "B000H6SY28", "B00AIA89OQ", "B001GMH8WE", "B008VNI9EW", "B00GOC74RU", "B000MQ4WMY", "B003PK28FM", "B000SMNK16", "B00000F61N", "B008VNI9TC", "B008L3650M", "B00DICPAMU", "B00GLT2SOA", "B000MGTQ6G", "B0002IQKAY", "B00JAD6BYW", "B002M9WW6W", "B000BYRCF6", "B0096RC57O", "B00FM4S8IU", "B000HWZ4IY", "B000A6T1J0", "B0001O3YHQ", "B001DZOCZU", "B005UL4NH0", "B00096S480", "B000LC4ZIA", "B00I458456", "B002ACKBU0", "B00008EYBH", "1589797493", "B00007KK5I", "B00HRUQB5O", "B003CNQPMY", "B0077T5SBS", "B0002JZT5U", "B000P6R9IA", "B000EBGE82", "B000ERVJKO", "B0002XVQNK"], "bought_together": ["B000ASDFIQ", "B000E3L7FK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00DXLO086", "B00GOC74RU", "B0014FAIYS", "B000E3L7FK"]}, "price": 15.43, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 42875}, "asin": "B0009B16TE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51KSHC6SXQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Bewitched - The Complete First Season (Black and White)"}

In post-World War II Japan, life on the Tokyo streets has become desperate. Amidst the ruins, a tough, well-worn group of prostitutes bands together for survival and companionship. When an ex-soldier enters into the circle, flames of jealousy, anger, and lust are fueled, ending with disastrous results.  On the surface, the story is a simple pulp tale of decadence thrown together by Nikkatsu Studios to make a quick buck.

{"description": "Dark Wateris Japanese horror auteur Hideo Nakata's return to the genre after hisRingcycle made you too scared to watch television ever again. WhereRingudealt with a supernatural force wreaking revenge via technology, this film is a much more traditional ghost story. After winning a custody battle for her daughter, single mother Yoshimi moves into what she thinks is the perfect apartment with her daughter Hitomi. No sooner have they unpacked than strange things begin to disturb their new life. A water leak from the supposedly abandoned apartment above gets bigger and bigger, a child's satchel reappears even though Yoshimi throws it away several times, and she is haunted by the image of a child wearing a yellow mackintosh who bears a striking resemblance to a young girl who disappeared several years before. The conventional narrative follows Yoshimi's increasingly desperate attempts to discover who or what force is haunting her daughter, but the story's execution is far from predictable. Nakata is the master of understated suspense: there's always a feeling of motiveless malignancy that runs like an undercurrent through his films--far more frightening than out and out shocks--and here he also practically drowns his audience in water imagery. The film is saturated; the relentless dripping in the apartment, the constant rain outside and the deliberately washed-out photography make any color, such as the yellow coat, seem incongruous and unsettling. Nakata also clears the film of unnecessary characters--this is an almost deserted Tokyo--preferring to concentrate the action on Yoshimi's rising hysteria as she struggles to understand what is happening and how to save her daughter. Granted, the special effects are somewhat unconvincing and the ending confused, but even so the result is a stylish and disquieting chiller that will do for bathtubs what hisRingfilms did for video recorders.--Kristen Bowditch", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000GSYRY6", "B000E0OE4O", "B00005JNJR", "B000GB5MOW", "B000LPS3B2", "B000H0M4CK", "B000E3LGMY", "B000A2XA8M", "B004O63TWW", "B00DW5IM14", "B000AWYOGE", "B000Q7ZKWU", "B000088NQR", "B0000AVHAO", "B000FS9FIA", "B003UTPL2A", "B000FVQYW2", "B000MEYKCI", "B000FZEQEQ", "B002P7UCJK", "B0000CC885", "B0009KQOZQ", "B0009WFEDC", "B000H5U5YO", "B000MM0LHS", "B0007XBM8O", "B000NO243E", "B000CSTKHE", "B0009X765K", "B0006SGYL0", "B000AAF25S", "B000MM0LH8", "B0018JKLT2", "B000GBEWNY", "B001KEGR66", "B000FZEQFK", "B0028DRGDQ", "B00BOYLIAC", "B000NA28GG", "B00136MBUW", "B0019X3YX2", "B00005LW4G", "B0002ZDW7Q", "B000CRR3ME", "B004P2VQZ2", "B0007CNY2W", "B0009YA3YA", "B000BVM240", "B00260LDSU", "B0009S2T0M", "B0002J4X20", "B002E2QH8G", "B00009MEC4", "B000FZEQVY", "B0000YAEHK", "B002U041OE", "B00HI9QDXO", "B001570H5K", "B00AEFYYH6", "B000NA21RM", "B0015ET3YO", "B0007GAG42", "B0009NCQL4", "B000F0UUMI", "B001VG2MAI", "B004H2CXBQ", "B00104AYG0", "B001MEJY8W", "B00125WAW8", "B000BGH2A4", "B000AM4PGI", "B001P3SA9Y", "B000EDWKZ6", "B0010SAGHS", "B000A2X3U2", "B0009W5KHW", "B000S0GYRU", "B00344EAM8", "B005D0RDPM", "B001221DUQ", "B0000CABGW", "B002OMIKSG", "B00BUBE2N4", "B008NNY8XQ", "B00019JR5Y", "B00AEFY2E6", "B0009XRZQK", "B006L4MWVE", "B00BOUXNNQ", "B00004W3HF", "B008G1JIQC", "B007I1Q4IG", "B000R7HY32", "B00GHH9IIA", "B0009X763M", "B00006AUIG", "B00009OWI1", "B0001EFV7M", "B000IMUYJM", "B0016MJ6KQ"], "bought_together": ["B000E0OE4O", "B000GSYRY6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000AWYOGE", "B00DW5IM14", "B000GSYRY6", "B0009WFEDC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 135749}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 13.99, "brand": "ADV Films", "asin": "B0009KA2UO", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41KFCTBTH3L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Dark Water"}
{"description": "The classic to clunker ratio is still extraordinarily high, thoughThe Simpsons' sixth season could give some devoted viewers pause. The show that takes cheeky delight in mooning television convention gives us \"Another Simpsons Clip Show\" and its first season-ending cliffhanger, \"Who Shot Mr. Burns?\" And, as does Bart in \"A Star Is Burns,\" we should all feel a little dirty at the \"cheap cartoon crossover\" appearance of Jay Sherman (Jon Lovitz), designed to give a boost to the ill-fated animated seriesThe Critic. But this is just beard-stroking tongue-clucking regarding a season that delivered episodes that rank in the hallowedThe Simpsonspantheon, among them, \"Homer Badman,\" in which lust for a gummy Venus de Milo, peeled from the behind of an unwitting babysitter, makes Homer the object of feminist protest and tabloid TV fodder, and \"Homer the Great,\" in which Homer is discovered to be the Chosen One to lead the secret society, \"The Stonecutters\" (\"Who holds back the electric car/Who made Steve Guttenberg a star?/We do!\").  Several episodes take their inspiration from classic films and books: Hitchcock'sRear Window(\"Bart of Darkness\"); Michael Crichton'sWestworldandJurassic Park(\"Itchy and Scratchy Land\"); and Stephen King and Ray Bradbury (\"Treehouse of Horror V\").This season's roster of guest voices is also especially impressive, including Winona Ryder as \"Lisa's Rival,\" Meryl Streep as Rev.

{"description": "\"Somewhere in the Night\" is an exemplary title for a film noir, and the shellshocked pilgrimage of an amnesiac WWII veteran through an L.A. shadow-zone of hotels, bars, steam baths, sanitariums, and creepy private dwellings casts an uncanny spell.  The plot is so byzantine, and the interlayering of the banal with the bizarre so pervasive, we may occasionally feel we've wandered into a Raul Ruiz mindgame in the guise of a '40s mystery-melodrama. The situation is primal: a man searching for his own identity, dreading what that identity will prove to be, yet so monastically dedicated to his mission that he won't reveal his dilemma to anyone even when it might ease his quest.The script is shot through with contradictions and improbabilities, though these loom more glaring in retrospect than during the viewing.  In his sophomore directorial outing, Joseph L. Mankiewicz--who would soon evolve into a multiple-Oscar-winner (Letter to Three Wives,All About Eve)--occasionally bungles action setups that any journeyman director could have handled in mid-yawn.  But he&#xB9;s also written some choice dialogue and slivered some engaging business into the proceedings--especially for Lloyd Nolan as a drugstore-philosopher homicide cop, and German-Expressionist refugee Fritz Kortner (Pandora's Box), whose arias of Continental fatalism and duplicity are sheer delight.  The always-assured Richard Conte is slick as an affable nightclub operator, and there are fine bits by a host of unbilled character players (Whit Bissell, Henry \"Harry\" Morgan, Jeff Corey, Houseley Stevenson).  But Hodiak makes a charismatically challenged leading man, and a better actress than neophyte Nancy Guild (\"rhymes with wild!\") would have found it tough to bring off the combination of worldliness and devotion required of the nightclub chanteuse who offers him aid and comfort.--Richard T.

{"description": "Movie studios, by and large, avoid controversial subjects like race the way you might avoid a hive of angry bees. So it's remarkable thatCrasheven got made; that it's a rich, intelligent, and moving exploration of the interlocking lives of a dozen Los Angeles residents--black, white, latino, Asian, and Persian--is downright amazing. A politically nervous district attorney (Brendan Fraser) and his high-strung wife (Sandra Bullock, biting into a welcome change of pace fromMiss Congeniality) get car-jacked by an oddly sociological pair of young black men (Larenz Tate and Chris \"Ludacris\" Bridges); a rich black T.V. director (Terrence Howard) and his wife (Thandie Newton) get pulled over by a white racist cop (Matt Dillon) and his reluctant partner (Ryan Phillipe); a detective (Don Cheadle) and his Latina partner and lover (Jennifer Esposito) investigate a white cop who shot a black cop--these are only three of the interlocking stories that reach up and down class lines. Writer/director Paul Haggis (who wrote the screenplay forMillion Dollar Baby) spins every character in unpredictable directions, refusing to let anyone sink into a stereotype.

{"description": "Those in search of happy endings and maudlin moments may walk away disappointed from the extremely enjoyableKing of the Corner, a modest, often touching film fully equipped with some very big laughs.    Aging salesman Leo Spivak (Peter Reigert) is coming to terms with his incredibly messy life; his career is dimming, his elderly father (Eli Wallach) is quickly fading, and his personal life is in shambles.   Is Leo falling apart at the seams, or will this be his golden opportunity to take stock and turn it all around?     Visiting universal themes like adultery, parenthood, and death,King of the Cornerjumps smoothly between sad and funny to incredibly uncomfortable as Leo faces life's daily ups and downs in the only way that he knows how--very awkwardly. The plot isn't so much about resolutions and answers as is it about the journey and finding a laugh here and there along the way.You might know actor Peter Reigert from quirky sleepers likeLocal HeroandCrossing Delancey, his excellent turn in the intenseTraffic, or his hilarious Donald \"Boon\" Schoenstein inAnimal House.    Many, however, may be surprised to find that his 2001-directed shortBy Courierwas nominated for an Academy Award and that with this, his first full-length feature film, he delivers a breezy, well-packaged crowd pleaser. Reigert's efficient directing style keeps the story moving comfortably along while his sardonic screen presence and a terrific cast including Beverly D'Angelo (Coal Miner's Daughter), Isabella Rossellini (Blue Velvet), and Rita Moreno (West Side Story) all bring something to the table in roles large and small.   Like reality,King of the Cornerportrays life as it is: lots of lose ends, no easy answers, and every once in a while, very funny.--Matt Wold", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000JU8H9C"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 342522}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.07, "brand": "Ardustry Home Entertainment", "asin": "B000AQ69NQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51J7TFSY1TL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "King Of The Corner"}

{"description": "A film can be smart and subtle and still be a roller coaster ride. Case in point:Kings and Queen; Arnaud Desplechin's brilliant, exhilarating movie never takes a predictable turn. We follow two people along mostly parallel paths:  Nora (Emmanuelle Devos, fromRead My Lips), a chic gallery owner with an ailing father and an impending marriage, and Ismael (Mathieu Amalric), a hyperactive musician who's been sent to a psychiatric hospital against his will. The story of the self-contained Nora can be as scorching as an Ingmar Bergman movie (especially late in the film), while daffy Ismael's tale is a screwball comedy at times--complete with a droll Catherine Deneuve as his bemused doctor. Desplechin'sHow I Got Into an Argument&#x85; (My Sex Life)was one of the best European films of the 1990s (also starring Amalric and Devos), and he is gifted with a sure sense of human behavior as well as cinematic dexterity.. Rarely have so many scenes of people talking in rooms flown by so quickly. Movies need not travel to exotic locales to summon up an adventure, and this is film adventuring of a high order.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00004TBFR", "B002M36R28", "B00009OOFG", "1572525983", "B00006LPD1", "B001CIOCLC", "B0087OULO6", "B00ANQHR7U", "B000JLTS3K", "B000HIVIQU", "B002VKB0M4", "B00DHN8G3U", "1572522135", "B0087IT8FK", "B002U6DVOY", "B0018KZ448"], "bought_together": ["B002M36R28"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00004TBFR"]}, "price": 13.45, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 254173}, "asin": "B000B9EYG6", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/511TEFCVFDL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Kings &amp; Queen"}
{"description": "Blockbuster action director Michael Bay delivers a striking look at a strange world of the future in this sci-fi action drama. Midway through the 21st century, Lincoln Six Echo (Ewan McGregor) lives in a confined indoor community after ongoing abuse of the Earth has rendered most of the planet uninhabitable. One of the only places in the outside world still capable of sustaining life is an idyllic island where citizens are chosen to live through a lottery. Or at least that's what Lincoln and his fellow citizens are taught to believe; the truth is that Lincoln, like everyone he knows, is actually a clone who is kept under wraps to provide needed organs when the person who supplied his or her DNA falls ill. When he becomes aware that his existence is a fraud, Lincoln escapes to the outside world with a fellow clone, Jordan Two Delta (Scarlett Johansson), though the powers that be are determined to see that no one gets away alive.The Islandalso stars Steve Buscemi, Djimon Hounsou, Michael Clarke Duncan, and Sean Bean.", "related": {"also_bought": ["0767805712", "B002UZCJ8Y", "B0069UP2PI", "B00005JL78", "B0013PSTMC", "B004LWZW7E", "B004XQO90O", "B008JFUO36", "B000TGJ8CQ", "B00AEFXCLU", "B001GCUO02", "B0001NBNDY", "B002GIBVVG", "B00KHWSB5M", "B0018O4YT0", "B00005JLWN", "B0001CNRAM", "B002ZG98SW", "B00005JN0T", "B00K7IPFSM", "B00JPFTX5O", "B0009YA3OA", "B001CC7PLM", "B000AP04FG", "B005LAIIMG", "B005LAII8A", "B0013LL2Z2", "B002ZG980U", "B008JFUN50", "B00005JMWP", "B000EQHXNW", "B004WCTLNY", "B004EPYZOO", "B001GKJ2E8", "B007R6DJP8", "B00AEFXSLE", "B00AKGG8I2", "B000EZ908Y", "B00AIBZMD6", "B00BEIYIF0", "B0045HCJ8A", "B004LWZW4M", "B000BVM1S2", "B0067EKYAY", "B00AEBB8NI", "B001FB55HQ", "B00005JPAR", "B004LWZW42", "B001VLBDD0", "B0062P3392", "B000FS9FCG", "B008JFUPFI", "B00IKM5MIA", "B004A8ZX28", "B000056PMU", "B00005JPD0", "B005COLETU", "B003Q6D2B4", "B004EPYZSK", "B000P0J0EW", "B009AMAJPA", "B002SG7Z7A", "B00H83EUQW", "B000LC55F2", "B00DWZHTOU", "B005NKIPUY", "B005LAIHPE", "B000A2IPQY", "B00AEBB89W", "B0051MKNV8", "B005LAIIPS", "B001EAWMGA", "B00A7MSQRK", "6304711891", "B000QQJ3Q0", "B002GHHHOC", "B0021L8V0M", "B000P0I4O4", "B0013FDM7E", "B00AS1Q93S", "B00004XPPG", "B0045HCJFS", "B003UYUQZW", "B001OQCVI8", "B003QO8TOQ", "B00096S49Y", "B005LAIGRS", "B000EGDB10", "B002ZG984Q", "B000FGGE68", "B003L20IG0", "B0036TGSR6", "B0045HCJGC", "B002DU39GW", "B0002KVUKM", "B008JFUQZ2", "B000H30B2C", "0767803434", "B00AEBB8QK"], "bought_together": ["0767805712", "B0069UP2PI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004WCTLNY", "B004XQO90O", "B00JJ3EHCG", "B004SBQAN8"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 95555}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.44, "brand": "Dreamworks Skg", "asin": "B000BO0LH2", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5133H8SZ04L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Island"}
{"description": "In this third season, Mary Richards (Mary Tyler Moore), she of the \"bright smile and infectious vivacity,\" got to display some of that celebrated \"spunk\" of hers. In the season&#x96;opener, \"The Good-Time News,\" she demands to be paid the same amount of money as her predecessor. In \"The Georgette Story,\" she defies her boss, Lou Grant (Ed Asner), and vainglorious anchorperson Ted Baxter (Ted Knight) by counseling Ted's new girlfriend, whom he takes for granted. And in \"Romeo and Mary,\" she finally stands up to an overzealous suitor (guest star Stuart Margolin), which hilariously backfires on her.The Mary Tyler Moore Showendures because its timeless comedy is drawn from the wellspring of its fully drawn characters, who were allowed to grow beyond one-note caricatures. Mary's best friend, Rhoda (Valerie Harper), who was in danger of becoming this series' Sally Rogers, really blossomed this season. In \"Rhoda the Beautiful,\" the slimmed-down Rhoda is empowered to enter a beauty contest, and in \"My Brother's Keeper,\" she catches the eye of Phyllis' (Cloris Leachman in an Emmy-nominated performance) brother, which devastates Phyllis, setting the stage for yet another disastrous Mary Richards party (and a d&#xE9;nouement that must have been daring in 1973). Wise-cracking Murray (Gavin McLeod) reveals new depths in \"Murray Faces Life,\" in  which he sinks into depression after hearing that a former college classmate has won the Pulitzer Prize. Even Ted manages to surprise. In \"Operation: Lou,\" a hospitalized Lou Grant finds a new appreciation for Ted, who graciously and uncharacteristically, presents him with an expensive bottle of scotch. Moore, Harper, and Knight were each honored with Emmys this season. Joining this august core ensemble is Georgia Engel as Georgette, who makes a delightful first impression in \"Rhoda Morgenstern: Minneapolis to New York.\" Even hard-boiled Lou softens in her presence. \"You're a real cutie, you know that?\" he tells her in \"The Georgette Story.\" Despite Lou's insistence to the contrary in \"The Good-Time News,\"The Mary Tyler Moore's job was to make people laugh. But it could also be surprisingly moving, as in the laugh-free dramatic climax of \"Remembrance of Things Past,\" in which Mary is reunited with an ex-boyfriend (Joseph Campanella), who has broken her heart in the past. This three-disc set contains no extras, but any of these episodes can take a nothing day and suddenly... well, you know the rest.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000EXDS02", "B00096S480", "B0011N19HI", "B00005JLIC", "B002WN8IR0", "B003VTKZ84", "B000E6ES9Y", "B001O4KBN2", "B000G6BL7O", "B000A9QKSM", "B003CNQPME", "B002C8YSBU", "B000YKYT1M", "B00144K5M4", "B0000AZKKP", "B0001IN0BC", "B004083REE", "1451659202", "B00009VRF0", "B001OXLGK0", "B0006Q93BU", "B00HRUQB5O", "B00GOC74QG", "B00GHH9HW2", "B000EQ5PTQ", "B00274SIVK", "B000A0GOP0", "B00016XN48", "B000YGGNGK", "B00KTZALDC", "B0006IUDYY", "B000TD0PHG", "B00023B1WQ", "B004ES6TBS", "B005E7SEOI", "B00HNGC56G", "B00EQ2KU7G", "B000UX6TKM", "B00FM4S7P4", "B000MGTQ6G", "B0000AUXVS", "B008MIYKB2", "B000Z27H8Q", "B0002Y4T7O", "B005BUA1JY", "B006VC3L9S", "B000E3L7EQ", "B002E58FTC", "B0028SVY3E", "B000RXZL0E", "B001DZOCVO", "B0007TKG76", "B005DCJ0Q0", "B000NTMA1U", "B002E58FTW", "B00CL152AY", "B001LRTT30", "B000G0O5J6", "B002E58FU6", "B000QUEQ6I", "B0007WFY4S", "B00GLPYVT4", "B000C1VBAA", "B000AJJNJK", "B002E58FUG", "B00IFK7ONI", "B000G0O5JG", "B000PISZ86", "B000F8O2MO", "B00DXLO086", "B0002NY8R6", "B00008EYBH", "B008VNI9TC", "B000G6BLDI", "1451659229", "B00HXH5WNI", "B001IXXYCE", "B003JHXS5A", "B00G5N6C8U", "B002FLOTFO", "B00GOC74RU", "B00JHH1VUU", "B00BHWG0N6", "B004WO9OMA", "B002E58FT2", "B0030ATZH6", "B000MQ4WMY", "B00008EY6N", "B006VC3L48", "B000VDDE1I", "B002E58FTM", "B0031XYLR6", "B0001NBNIY", "B00280QNKG", "B0089BSLKS", "B002OOWKVM", "B0095FJHWI", "B0011FLGYM", "B00IF0KAYS", "B002ACKBTG"], "bought_together": ["B00096S480", "B000EXDS02"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005JLIC", "B00096S480", "B002WN8IR0", "B000EXDS02"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 19038}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 14.03, "brand": "20TH CENTURY FOX HOME ENTMNT", "asin": "B000BOH8YQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41CMP7NGC6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Mary Tyler Moore Show: The Complete Third Season"}

{"description": "Following a tumultuousthird seasonthat culminated in the shooting of likeable villain J.R. Ewing (Larry Hagman) by an unknown assailant,Dallas: The Complete Fourth Seasonis relatively tame by comparison. Still, it begins with no fewer than four episodes stretching out the mystery of who (from a wide field of candidates) actually shot J.R., with the victim's alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), looking like the chief suspect. Meanwhile, with J.R. out of commission and possibly paralyzed by a bullet pressing against his spine, brother Bobby (Patrick Duffy) reluctantly takes the reins of Ewing Oil at the insistence of his father, Jock (Jim Davis). Prepared to buy a refinery at a bargain price&#x97;something Jock always wanted but J.R. could never deliver&#x97;Bobby is set to take Ewing Oil to a new level of success, but finds his authority undercut by J.R., who is pulling strings from his hospital bed.Another suspect in the shooting, Cliff Barnes (Ken Kercheval), brother of Bobby's wife, Pam (Victoria Principal), tries to jumpstart his return to Texas politics by making trouble for the Ewings in the Texas legislature. Bobby himself, burned out on the family business, tries his own hand at the state senate, a useful place to be once Jock and Ewing matriarch Miss Ellie (Barbara Bel Geddes), mired in a personal conflict that heads toward divorce, find themselves on opposite sides in a land dispute. Other story threads include a rocky marriage between granddaughter Lucy (Charlene Tilton) and a medical student (Leigh McCloskey), and extramarital distraction for lonely Pam and Sue Ellen. Perhaps the biggest scandal of the season is J.R.'s manipulation of a counterrevolution in the Southeast Asian country where Ewing Oil fields were disastrously nationalized--a crime that could come back to haunt him.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0009IW894", "B000FI9OD6", "B000JLTRFE", "B00028G7LG", "B000PAAK0A", "B000YGGNIS", "B0016I0AGY", "B001C9S0F0", "B001JAHPWQ", "B001JAHPX0", "B001JAHPXA", "B001JAHPXK", "B004H83IHI", "B000CS45AG", "B009GYS70Q", "B00E7XS4EA", "B00CD45J5W", "B001BN4WLS", "B0015I2S7E", "B000PGUT8C", "B00005JOA4", "B004X1M47O", "B004X1M3DE", "B001QU9RRK", "B002VJ05EE", "B007R915RE", "1581824726", "B002VJ05EO", "B003FSTN8E", "B0002Y4T7O", "B0007IO6V4", "B002XKKX8E", "B007R915U6", "B004IB04S0", "B0041SI7A2", "B003CNQPMY", "B00H5NY6F0", "B001VB8UCW", "B005DGKBDC", "B003BGZ61S", "B0009UC80Q", "B00308B170", "B0007WFY4S", "B002ACKBU0", "B001D2WUDE", "B005DLN1LG", "B003F9LS90", "B00K8HALVI", "B00J9BZ4KC", "B001G0MFP6", "B007R915QK", "B0063FGERO", "B0001WNL2G", "B0035QHXLK", "B00005JO4F", "B0077T5SBS", "B001UHOWYM", "B0053TWVSC", "B00BLF9FYA", "B000FA57U8", "B000QUEQ68", "B005IQGNHK", "B0007WQHFS", "B0096RC57O", "B000CELOV8", "B00005QT9P", "B0077PTWX2", "B00JEZWRE4", "B000067S1G", "B000ASDFIG", "B000MCH5AO", "B00BDZV8ZM", "B00096S480", "B00BMSU950", "B003IRUFCU", "B00EAPC860", "B000GRU09I", "B0038SUBDC", "B0000798EY", "B004WO9OMA", "B000C6NPHC", "B00CD45J52", "B00BUWD7E8", "B004MWLXTY", "B0001ZMWYG", "B00008PW1F", "B000FOPPBA", "B000O77SNG", "B00005JNIS", "B00ARWX2SI", "B001GLFPWK", "B002E58FTW", "B00080ZG2E", "B0028SVY3Y", "B00HQLZCIQ", "B000LXH3SI", "B00DYQ1GBE", "B00JM5C8WM", "B000FUH38C"], "bought_together": ["B0009IW894", "B000FI9OD6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0009IW894", "B00028G7LG", "B000FI9OD6", "B000JLTRFE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 10661}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 15.93, "brand": "WEA", "asin": "B000BVM1TG", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51VCFDJ7X7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Dallas: Season 4"}

{"description": "Long before reality-show staples \"Big Brother\" and \"The Real World\" tapped into the drama and high-hilarity of cohabitation, the long-running \"Golden Girls\" paved the way into that prime-time show format. Only difference is that \"Golden Girls\" was pure fiction. Season Four stays true to the format that earned the series three Emmys and a Golden Globe Award: Three widowed/divorced friends in their '50s and one octogenarian mother and grandmother all share a home and their retirement in Miami, Florida. In a season that includes a UFO sighting and government cover up; the implications of drug addiction; a late-in-life wedding; the ridiculous '80s aerobics craze--spandex, headbands, leg warmers and all; a nightmarish nursing home; lesbianism; an intergenerational love triangle; and a trip to Rose's mythical St. Olaf; the episodes in Season Four are more entertaining and often downright risqu&#xE9;.There are some notable cameos as well--Bob Hope steals the show in \"You Gotta Have Hope\" as the featured talent for Dorothy's hospital charity show; Richard Mulligan of \"Empty Nest\" bridges the spin-off link as the girls' newly widowed neighbor and object of Blanche's advances; Jay Thomas plays an overactive director in \"High Anxiety,\" where the girls' kitchen is used as a TV commercial set; and blink and you'll miss a young Quentin Tarantino as an Elvis impersonator in \"Sophia's Wedding.\" A terrific bonus feature captures the performances of all the season's guest stars on Disc One. Overall, Season Four is zestier and much less earnest than previous seasons, which is exactly what works about the series: the bawdier the grandmothers, the funnier the show.--Gabi Knight", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000EBGFQI", "B000AJJNJK", "B000I2J6VE", "B000KGGIL4", "B0007KTBJO", "B0002W4SX6", "B002TMOJDG", "B00DZZ5K3Y", "0557102812", "B001O4KBNM", "B002OOWKYE", "1491012080", "B0030ATZH6", "B00I458456", "B0028S110A", "B00BUWD7E8", "B005M5OSBU", "B00D2UMHB0", "B0027SF6K2", "B00GLT2SOA", "B0009JQN6M", "B00DJYK1XU", "B0007WFXL2", "B00I099K4U", "B008VNI9TC", "B008L3653O", "B0007WQHFS", "B000MGTQ6G", "B000ENUYG8", "B00GOC75YW", "B0000DFZ5O", "B000BNTM46", "B0002Y4T7O", "B000A0GOQY", "B0007Y08RY", "B0001O3YHQ", "B007RMQ4CW", "B00BUWD7SO", "B000H1RFXM", "B001993YB8", "B000DZ95IU", "B000QFCDAY", "B0012EM5E2", "B001DZOCVO", "B000I2J6W8", "B008L36520", "B000BYA4JW", "B004YOEECS", "B005MQ58OU", "B0006Q93AQ", "B00007E8RS", "B000B5XOUC", "B001JAHSAA", "B006UKX628", "B000G1R3A8", "B001JAHSAK", "B00BXTH474", "B00009Y3RW", "B00133QNSG", "B008KZX7W0", "B000G0O5EG", "B002YBUX0K", "B001FFBI9G", "B005D0OHA6", "B000EYK4H6", "B00DXLO086", "B00EQ2KU7G", "B008H6GHII", "B002TMS4LO", "B0015XWU9A", "B000AJJNIQ", "B007PK8686", "B00H5NY6F0", "B0058J3S16", "B008L3650M", "B007WE6QVE", "B000KGH00C", "B001IXXYCE", "B0001NBNJ8", "B003XL6EI0", "B0007US79Y", "B000FA57U8", "B000BKDNVM", "B000TGJ8B2", "B0058JEI06", "B000FL7C8W", "B0011N19HI", "B000MX7V5W", "B00DXLO0D6", "B000ERVJMW", "B009LDD4V4", "B00BUWD7Y8", "B004B93RHY", "B000MQCUJ6", "B00I099JYQ", "B0009WFEEG", "B000BF0C8E"], "bought_together": ["B000EBGFQI", "B000AJJNJK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000AJJNJK", "B0007KTBJO", "B0002W4SX6", "B000I2J6VE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 5403}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 19.98, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B000C1VBAA", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ATZPSMNJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Golden Girls: Season 4"}

{"description": "In his third feature, director Noah Baumbach scores a triumph with an autobiographical coming-of-age story about a teenager whose writer-parents are divorcing.  The father (Jeff Daniels) and mother (Laura Linney) duke it out in half-civilized, half-savage fashion, while their two sons adapt in different ways, shifting allegiances between parents.  The film is squirmy-funny and nakedly honest about the rationalizations and compensatory snobbisms of artistic failure as well as the conflicted desires of adolescents for sex and status.  In detailing bohemian-bourgeois life in brownstone Brooklyn, Baumbach is spot on.  Everyone proceeds from good intentions and acts rather badly, in spite or because of their manifest intelligence.  Fulfilling the best traditions of the American independent film, this quirky, wisely written feature explores the gulf between sexes, generations, art and commerce, Brooklyn and Manhattan.", "related": {"also_bought": ["0767821408", "6305428239", "B0010X8NF0", "B0000640VJ", "B0007UC8Y4", "B001QOGYBI", "B002ZG97T2", "B0011NVC8Y", "B007L6VR12", "B000FUF7DA", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B0006TPE4C", "B00005JLX8", "B00007AJF8", "B00005JLRE", "B0014GI6I2", "B00000G02H", "B001P3SA8K", "B004SEUIW4", "B003102JDM", "B00005JMJG", "B00H9HZITU", "B0024HH2WG", "081099741X", "B0081FSMII", "B00005JMJ4", "B003Q7B7CO", "B001E95ZNS", "B00EO2I6SI", "B003L20ICE", "B008220DGE", "B002ZG97TC", "B0035G5IOE", "B009B8YZCQ", "B000C20VVE", "B007L6VR6M", "B0083V2W4U", "B003KGBIS4", "B00003CXQ4", "B000K7VHQE", "B000E33VWW", "B000BX8R1A", "B007UW9W32", "B00003CWTI", "B003N82OP0", "B008Y1YJMM", "B001HN699A", "B000M4RG7E", "B00AEFY8MM", "B00AEBB9CS", "B00GMV8KGW", "B000M5B98A", "B005LAIGF0", "B00GMV8L1Q", "B00JAQJNN0", "B00J5LXQKQ", "B00005AUJK", "B003UESJLU", "B00005Q4CS", "1572527005", "B0016MJ6HY", "B001UV4XGU", "B0089XJXRQ", "B002AFX53M", "B003U6SJYU", "B00IXPQU6M", "B00CIOD6HK", "B001UV4XUG", "B0045O2PHS", "B00007976U", "B005HK13SG", "B000PAAJZ6", "B00606P0BM", "B0002DB52M", "B001DJ7PR8", "B00AEFYSWM", "B004UVYQVY", "B00004XPP8", "B002LVVCJY", "0802867189", "0830827048", "B00008K7AO", "B00D3LA5WG", "B0012E2GFK", "B001CW7ZT4", "B0007OCG5G", "B00005JLSK", "B00AG4760C", "B000FVQM2Y", "0809141183", "0830828052", "B004UXUX4Q", "B000CNESTE", "0205827195", "B00008DP4C", "6304907729", "B005PTMPYA", "B00003CXDJ", "B0042U9B3G", "B0008JIJ10"], "bought_together": ["0767821408", "6305428239"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0007UC8Y4", "B0010X8NF0", "B0000640VJ", "0767821408"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 67820}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.54, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B000CS464G", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Q2MVZ5QRL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Squid and the Whale (Special Edition)"}

{"description": "Cheri Oteri breathed bracing fresh air into the seasons she appeared onSaturday Night Live, and created memorable characters both absurd and delightful. This 78-minute disc contains samples of some of her signature performances, including the preternaturally peppy cheerleader, Arianna, paired with a strapping Will Ferrell. (Ever tried to lead a cheer at the team's&#x85;swim meet? Arianna never met a challenge she couldn't conquer.)  Oteri also takes on media icon Barbara Walters, satirized decades earlier by the incomparable Gilda Radner as Baba Wawa. Oteri's impersonation both pays homage to Radner's and takes it to a new level of absurdity; Oteri's Walters is a randy, name-dropping old coot who doesn't miss a beat--or an opportunity to aggrandize herself (\"I was horseback riding the other day with Saddam Hussein&#x85;\"). Don't miss the brief skit where Walters tries to have phone sex with a nonplussed Tom Brokaw. Other signature characters include Oteri's Judge Judy and the prescription hound Collette (appearing here in a priceless bit with John Goodman as a flummoxed pharmacist). And of course, the abusive Burger Castle counter chick Nadeen, who shoots down every customer request with a \"Simma down, now!\" Extras include audition and dress rehearsal footage, and an audio commentary by Oteri.--A.T.

Her closest relationship is with Robert Dudley, the Earl of Leicester (Jeremy Irons), whom the council will not allow her to wed. Because Robert wishes to produce an heir, he marries another, garnering Elizabeth's disfavor (and nor is he all that thrilled about her dalliance with Henry, the Duke of Anjou). In time, he'll return to her good graces. As she explains, \"Friendship outlasts love and is stronger than love.\" Then, as his health begins to fails, she'll turn to his stepson, the dashing, if duplicitous Robert Devereaux, the Earl of Essex (Hugh Dancy, the Hooper-directedDaniel Deronda). Meanwhile, Mary, Queen of Scots (Barbara Flynn) plots against her Protestant cousin. Even after Mary makes her exit, plenty of other powerful Catholics will stop at nothing to seize the crown. Marked as much by triumph as tragedy, the role of Elizabeth I has been catnip for many illustrious actresses, notably Bette Davis, Glenda Jackson, and Cate Blanchett. Mirren's multi-faceted portrayal of the queen's golden years is a worthy addition to that canon and Irons is a particularly formidable foil.--Kathleen C.

{"description": "Leave it to Dario Argento (Suspiria) to cook up a truly stomach-flipping installment in Showtime'sMasters of Horrorseries. Argento's hour-longJeniferhas an uncluttered through-line that combines a relentlessly destructive film noir plot with zombie attitude. Steven Weber plays a cop who kills a man about to harm a disfigured woman named Jenifer. Weber finds himself strangely protective of the girl, who incidentally has enough sexual appetite to tempt him away from everything sane and holy. Unfortunately, she has other appetites as well, which spells trouble for the odd child (or housecat) who might be taken as a snack. Weber's downward spiral is predictable enough, but there's something in almost every scene that makes you shiver--either overtly (Jenifer chomping down on entrails) or indirectly (the way trees ripple as a car moves into the forest). Jenifer is played by Carrie Anne Fleming, wearing a prosthetic horror mask and flimsy negligee, an unsettling combination of repulsive/sexy that Argento exploits to the maximum. The trim script is by Steven Weber, from a short story by Bruce Jones; the excellent music is by Claudio Simonetti, whose ensemble Goblin did the music for other Argento films and the originalDawn of the Dead.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000GI3RHY", "B000KJTFBG", "B000GB5M2Y", "B000E5KUME", "B000NY0YJA", "B000FA57W6", "B000F3UACK", "B000E5KUMO", "B000GB5M2O", "B000F3UACU", "B000FS2W3K", "B000RIWAV2", "B000LPS47K", "B000KJTFB6", "B000RL21PO", "B000S1MMCK", "B002LMSWN2", "B000WC38FU", "B000UR9QXK", "B0015D3YRM", "B000RL21OK", "B000PWQP9I", "B000S1MMCU", "B002FICQFM", "1578482542", "B004BLJQOK", "B0055SJX6O", "B001KKU9CI", "B000UYX4P4", "B000ERVKLW", "B000EOTVU2", "B000S0GYRU", "B000S0GYRK", "B00003CXUP", "B00AJLHUA8", "B005SQRYB4", "B001QMCJ0U", "B00AZTUUQK", "B0021L8UXA", "B004LWZW24", "B0021L8UPS", "B000S0GYS4", "B00HRUQ8X4", "B0007WQHI0", "B000GI3KGC", "B002JT69IW", "B00006AUIG", "B0031U8OEK", "B001HPOJ68", "B000FS2W1W", "B009XTF8KQ", "B001D5C1OO", "B00FUABJJQ", "B00005RHGK", "B00HRJVHKE", "B000OYCMO4", "B002EP8FDI", "B0041KKYCY", "B001AR0D6I", "B000A2X3U2", "B004FUPK6U", "B000UVV22O", "B0013D8L7M", "B001B187L6", "B000F3UA84", "B005GT3X68", "B001MVYUR0", "B000PMLJMQ", "B00HHYF56Q", "B002AMVEII", "B000CEXF5Q", "B003VA3JUO", "B003VOVW22", "B006QWC2ZC", "B00B999FBG", "B003YCL0YG", "B002USF1WC", "B006ZL1PMA", "B00E5S2HGS", "B004SIP9O2", "B00F3OLVHY", "B00023P4UQ", "B00125WATQ", "B004EPYZO4", "B0021L8UFI", "B001RXDM18", "B000RO9Q7W", "B000MV8ZCW", "B0014VPFVS", "B0097C046W", "B008G33PIM", "B001LIK8DO", "B001KEHAE4", "B000AWYOGE", "B00HJD3PTO", "B00GS08UDU", "B000FA57WG", "B00009MEC4", "B001U0HBQA", "B000TZJCMS"], "bought_together": ["B000GB5M2Y", "B000GI3RHY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000UVV22O", "B000WC384Q", "B000GB5M2Y", "B000RIWAV2"]}, "price": 7.77, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 154284}, "asin": "B000FS2W3A", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51C141WN34L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Masters of Horror - Dario Argento - Jenifer"}
{"description": "The most unlikely horror-movie icon this side ofLeprechaun, the homicidal doll Chucky has blossomed into one of the most recognizable faces of fright fare over the last two decades, and this double-disc set chronicles four of his most monstrous misadventures. The original--and still quite creepy--Child's Playfeature (from 1988) is not included in the set (that title is owned by MGM, and this set is a Universal release), so theKiller DVD Collectionkicks off with the more formulaicChild's Play 2(1990) and3('91, directed byLostproducer/director Jack Bender), both of which are saved only by veteran character actor Brad Dourif as the voice of Chucky. The series received a much-needed shot in the arm in 1998 withBride of Chucky, an over-the-top revamp that dispensed with the tired horror-movie mechanics and dove headfirst into a gleeful mix of camp and gore; much of the credit for that film's success must go to Hong Kong director Ronny Yu (Bride with White Hair), who imparts much visual flair to the proceedings and Jennifer Tilly as an amoral moll whose attempt to free the killer that possesses Chucky results in another monster doll on the loose. The fifth (and to date, final)Child's Play/Chucky feature,Seed of Chucky, rounds out the set; it strives for the humor-horror quotient of Yu's film, and yields mixed results.No extras are featured on the first two sequels, but bothBrideandSeedoffer up commentaries and featurettes for the devoted Chucky fans.Bridegets two commentaries--one with Yu, and the other with Dourif, Tilly, and scriptwriter Don Mancini, whileSeed's commentary has Mancini (who was promoted to director) and Tilly. Making-of featurettes for both features are also included, as well as a clip of Tilly onThe Tonight Show. None of these supplements will be new to the longtimeChild's Playcollector--all have been released on previous single and multi-disc sets--and buyers should know that they will find the R-rated versions ofBrideandSeedhere, and not the unrated versions (which have also been previously released). So it's fans looking to fill in the Chucky gap in their DVD libraries that will benefit the most from theKiller DVD Collection.--Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001B1UO6W", "B004AC6PMG", "B00DTPRZ10", "B005CM1ILQ", "B001DJLD1W", "B001DJLD0S", "B005CFBZQ6", "B0033B5XCS", "B005CFBZVG", "B0053TWVDC", "B0002JP572", "B005CFC0N8", "B005CFBYW6", "B003PIUINS", "B00005JND2", "B000VKL6Z2", "B002ZG971U", "0783232039", "B001JFZ1UE", "B00DTPRZ0G", "B00006FDCD", "B000Q66Q2O", "1573628174", "B001NPD9LS", "B0000VCZMK", "B004LWZW2O", "B0091G7BTM", "B000FA57US", "B008R52L3Y", "B000RIWAVW", "B000FA57UI", "B0002C4JJ4", "B0000CEB6Y", "B006ZL1P66", "0783230451", "B002YICNE2", "B002XD0J80", "B000I2J68M", "B002R3G912", "B004EPZ08O", "B00AEFY2WI", "B000A6T20S", "B000FS9FE4", "B000099T3M", "B0000AOX09", "B003PIUINI", "B00275EHFU", "B008874968", "B00006FI0R", "B00AEFY2LO", "B0000D9PNG", "B005J9ZFQG", "B000AM4P9K", "B00005UQ9I", "B008R52L98", "B004P7CNUY", "B00AEFY37C", "B002AS45VK", "B00006FDBT", "B0021L8UPS", "B00BM4Q4H6", "B003UGLCIA", "B002GHHHG0", "B00018D42W", "B0000AOX08", "B00079Z9WI", "B00005LC4Q", "B006CXIKYC", "B00005K3NZ", "B001DJLD12", "B00009PY4G", "B002G1WPI6", "B00005A8XX", "B0009X76XC", "B0053TWVIM", "B0053TWV46", "B00AQJ8MLY", "B00AEFY31S", "B00005LC4F", "B0056P6SOG", "B00006LPHA", "B0000WN0UU", "B003Q6D27S", "B00005NRN6", "B00005K3O4", "B000GBEWRU", "B000WC3864", "B004P7CM9Q", "B00AEBB9AA", "B000V4UFZK", "B000KJU1KK", "B0000X2EIS", "B001D2WU9I", "0783227434", "B000LC3ID8", "B000067FP8", "B000N4RAQU", "B00DMUFXOS", "B0013D8L7M", "B00005UQ9W"], "bought_together": ["B001B1UO6W", "B00DTPRZ10"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00DTPRZ24", "B001B1UO6W", "B00DTPRZ10", "0783230451"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 74069}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 22.95, "brand": "Universal Studios", "asin": "B000FWHW86", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51134TJ3BKL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Chucky: The Killer DVD Collection"}

Along withUnited 93, it's one of the most important films released byanyonein 2006. In the docudrama, which was produced for British television, Winterbottom and Mat Whitecross recount the travails of the Tipton Three, a trio of Britons detained for two years at Guant&#xE1;namo Bay. How did these apolitical Muslims end up as suspected terrorists? The directors attempt to answer that question by inter-cutting interviews and news footage with recreations of their Kafka-esque journey. It starts with a trip to Pakistan for the wedding of Asif (Afran Usman). In short order, he's joined by Ruhel (Farhad Harun), Shafiq (Riz Ahmed), and Monir (Waqar Siddiqui). On a whim, they decide to visit Afghanistan: \"One, for experience, and two, to help.\" It proves to be their undoing. First, they're caught in a bombing raid; then the Northern Alliance rounds them up as members of al-Qaeda. In the m&#xEA;l&#xE9;e, Monir goes missing. The remaining three are shipped to Cuba, where US officials stop at nothing to coerce confessions. There&#x92;s a hard-won happy ending, but it isn't easy to watch--Alan Parker's Ollie Stone-pennedMidnight Expressseems downright lyrical in comparison.

{"description": "A quintet of fun '50s science-fiction thrillers from the Universal vaults make their DVD debut in this three-disc set that's sure to please fans of vintage creature features. Arguably, the best of the lot isThe Incredible Shrinking Man(1957), with Grant Williams as a businessman whose exposure to a radioactive cloud causes him to decrease in size exponentially until he is literally microscopic. Based on a novel by legendary fantasy writer Richard Matheson, director Jack (Creature from the Black Lagoon) Arnold's balance of suspense (Williams' battles with a house cat and common spider) and pathos (the effect his condition has on his marriage) make it one of the most memorable science-fiction films of the decade, and a favorite even of those with only a passing interest in the genre. On the entirely other end of the spectrum isThe Mole People(1956), a loopy pulp adventure with John Agar and Hugh (Leave It to Beaver) Beaumont as intrepid adventurers who discover a lost city and the title creatures at a top of a Middle Eastern mountain. Campy to a fault, with a logic-straining script and ridiculous monsters,The Mole Peopleis also a goofy good time for B-movie mavens. Agar, whose faded star power forced him to seek work in low-budget films during the '50s and '60s, also turns up in the effectiveTarantula(1955), a fast-paced \"big bug\" creepshow modeled afterThem!.(1954), and featuring a cameo by Clint Eastwood as a jet pilot; the rest of the set is rounded out by the truly wackyMonster on the Campus(1958), with Arthur Franz as a college professor whose exposure to a prehistoric fish turns him into a rampaging Neanderthal, andThe Monolith Monsters(1957), about fragments of a meteor that grow to colossal heights when exposed to water and threaten a small desert community. For TV babies that grew up on a steady diet of Saturday afternoon monster movies,The Classic Sci-Fi Ultimate Collectionoffers a nostalgic trip back to those cathode-soaked days, but without the barrage of commercials. The set offers trailers for each film by way of extras, as well as an anamorphic presentation ofThe Incredible Shrinking Man; the rest of the titles are presented in full screen.-- Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000AQKU72", "B00D9EJFZA", "B000VX9WB4", "B0007R4T26", "B002TSAAS8", "B00005R1O7", "B000063UR0", "B000FVQLKW", "B00D9EJFV4", "B00HFWETZ8", "B00009NHC0", "B000RXVNDI", "B00DOZNGC2", "B00FQPLZ08", "B000EHSVJG", "B00465I1BK", "6305761078", "6305869367", "B000Y2Q9J0", "B000HEWEDK", "B005OT7YX8", "B000OHZJGO", "B000C20VNM", "B0000648YD", "6305944288", "B000BYA5IC", "B000UAFDR0", "B0002V7O2Y", "B000YDOOHI", "B005HIBWBG", "B000FOPPEC", "B002945DU2", "B0002NRRRY", "6305772711", "B000067FP3", "B0000694WH", "B00AEBB8VK", "B005ETANC2", "B00AY586X4", "B0007R4TR6", "B000056NWI", "B00CHYSSME", "B000062XE5", "B005TMY00K", "B000QGEB1W", "B007Y1NNAW", "B00005Y70U", "B003J216K4", "B00AWWX6XY", "B00006JDRG", "B000G28GHG", "B000BMY2KG", "6305772681", "B00027JYMG", "B00BNAE2AU", "B00358MG8S", "B00AEBB94G", "B00AEBB91E", "B0001HAGTM", "B00DZP1C9K", "B00080Z548"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0013XZ6SY", "B005ETANC2", "B002TSAAS8", "B00009NHC0"]}, "price": 29.49, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 109419}, "asin": "B000IV9CDM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51LvCFUiW9L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Classic Sci-fi Ultimate Collection (Tarantula / The Mole People / The Incredible Shrinking Man / The Monolith Monsters / Monster on the Campus)"}
{"description": "If Richard Donner's 1978 feature filmSuperman: The Moviemade us believe a man could fly, Bryan Singer's 2006 follow-up,Superman Returns, lets us remember that a superhero movie can make our spirits soar. Superman (played by newcomer Brandon Routh) comes back to Earth after a futile five-year search for his destroyed home planet of Krypton. As alter ego Clark Kent, he's eager to return to his job at the Daily Planet and to see Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth). Lois, however, has moved on: she now has a fianc&#xE9; (James Marsden), a son (Tristan Leabu), and a Pulitzer Prize for her article entitled \"Why the World Doesn't Need Superman.\" On top of this emotional curveball, his old archrival Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) is plotting the biggest land grab in history.Singer, who made a strong impression among comic-book fans for his work on the X-Men franchise and directed Spacey inThe Usual Suspects, brings both a fresh eye and a sense of respect to the world's oldest superhero. He borrows John Williams's great theme music and Marlon Brando's voice as Jor-El, and the story (penned by Singer'sX-Mencollaborators Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris) is a sort-of-sequel to the first two films in the franchise (choosing to ignore that the third and fourth movies ever happened). The humorous and romantic elements give the movie a heart, Singer's art-deco Metropolis is often breathtaking, and the special effects are elegant and spectacular, particularly an early airplane-disaster set-piece. Of the cast, Routh is excellent as the dual Superman/Clark, Spacey is both droll and vicious as Luthor, and Parker Posey gets the best lines as Luthor's moll Kitty. But at 23, Bosworth seems too young for the five-years-past-grizzled Lois. It's nice to see Noel Neill, Jack Larson (both from the classicAdventures of SupermanTV series), and Eva Marie-Saint on the screen as well. Superman Returns is one of those projects that was in development for seemingly forever, but it was worth the wait -- it's the most enjoyable superhero movie sinceSpider-Man 2andThe Incredibles.--David HoriuchiMore SupermanWatch our exclusive interviews with the cast ofSuperman ReturnsOther feature filmsSuperman in high definitionSmallvilleAdventures of SupermanSee all Superman DVDs", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001DJLD2G", "B000IJ79VQ", "B000IJ79X4", "B000IJ79XE", "B000IJ79WU", "B008JFUPFI", "B000IJ79UW", "B001CDR1FG", "B000ION23U", "B002GSXKN8", "B004EPZ07K", "B0000959N0", "B00005JNTU", "B004LWZWFQ", "B001DHXT20", "B000VI70QS", "B0006L0LOS", "B0007P0Y7C", "B000UR9T8C", "B00005JNJV", "B00005JMQW", "B00005JKCH", "B000AYELVU", "B004LWZW42", "B0090SI56Y", "B001OST0LW", "B001OST0M6", "B001QB9H1U", "B000HCO83Q", "B000PE0G0A", "B001GCUO1Q", "B0002IQMAM", "B004LWZWGA", "B008JFUS0U", "B000P0J06K", "B000OVLBF8", "B00E5I2MCM", "B003YAR97K", "B001GZ6QC4", "B00080ZG2O", "B003QO8TOQ", "B001FB55HQ", "B005LAIGW8", "B000I8OM94", "B000FO0AHY", "B00IZZDWKM", "B000P0J06U", "B0007V6ITE", "B008JFUO72", "B000AYELVA", "B002NXSRVG", "B00DYEN6XC", "B00E5I2MEK", "B000BT96EG", "B001HQZJMU", "B001QTXM5Y", "B00E5I2M6I", "B002HWRYJE", "B00E5I2M9K", "B001614E68", "B000059Z8L", "B001VLBDD0", "B000EU1Q3Q", "B000EU1Q2M", "B000KJU1KK", "B00BTYMPUY", "B000H30B2C", "B001F7MSFM", "B0013BM63O", "B00F4FFO8E", "B000EGDB10", "B00008G8M5", "B00JPS7HOA", "0790738953", "B000B7QCGS", "B000HWZ4E8", "B00BBXSPES", "B000FMGTTE", "B0083SBMBM", "B003Z8ZCDO", "B005LAII44", "B000P6XQ50", "B000VI28Z6", "B00AZMFJYA", "B001RHGRT8", "B000F4RH8E", "B002ZG99B8", "B001AK3S4Y", "B00005JL78", "B0002ZMHX6", "B0007G89FU", "B006VRRGNK", "B00BBAQD6S", "B009JBWOU0", "B000BT96FA", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B00BGI086Q", "B003UN2ICM", "B0000VCZMK"], "bought_together": ["B008JFUPFI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B008JFUPFI", "B00F4FFO8E", "B001DJLD2G", "B000IJ79UW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 57565}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.73, "brand": "DC Comics", "asin": "B000J10EQU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Ddmxk8VML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Superman Returns (Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "Out patrolling a California highway, police officer Edward Malus (Nicolas Cage) stops a station wagon to return a little girl's lost doll. Moments later, a runaway truck slams into the station wagon, igniting it into a fiery wreck with the mother and child trapped inside. Edward fails to save them before the car explodes...and then spends months of his life choking down pills to get the image of their faces out of his head. But Edward is about to get a second chance. A desperate letter from his former girlfriend, Willow (Kate Beahan), arrives at his home with no postmark. Willow came into his life and left just as unexpectedly years before. But now, her daughter Rowan has gone missing, and Edward is theonly person she trusts to help locate her. She asks him to come to her home on a private island - Summersisle - a place with its own traditions where people observe a forgotten way of life. Edward seizes the opportunity to make his life right again, and soon finds himself on a seaplane bound for the islands of the Pacific Northwest. But nothing is what it seems on isolated Summersisle, where a culture, dominated by its matriarch Sister Summersisle (Ellen Burstyn), is bound together by arcane traditions and a pagan festival called \"the Day of Death and Rebirth.\" The secretive people of Summersisle only ridicule his investigation, insisting that a child named Rowan never existed there... or if she ever did was no longer alive. But what Edward doesn't know is that Willow's plea for help has invited more into his life than a chance for redemption. In unraveling Summersisle's closely held secrets, Edward is drawn into a web of ancient traditions and murderous deceit, and each step he takes closer to the lost child brings him one step closer to the unspeakable.

{"description": "A moving and inspiring story of redemption and personal triumph in the face of great odds,Jet Li's Fearlessis the based-on-facts story of Chinese folk hero Huo Yuanjia (Jet Li). The son of a martial-arts master whose greatest strength was his restraint, Huo grows into an unbeatable fighter whose pride and thoughtlessness lead to a chain of tragic losses. After a classic wanderer-in-the-wilderness penance, Huo reinvents himself as a mature instructor of Wushu, a martial arts system that embraces all forms of fighting without preference or pre-judgement. He also becomes a populist symbol, at the dawn of the 20th century, of China's refusal to entirely capitulate to the boot of Western colonialists. Taking on whatever European, American, or Japanese fighter the outsiders bring in to demoralize the natives, Huo becomes a legend that, in real life, is still revered. Thrillingly directed by Ronny Yu (Warriors of Virtue),Jet Li&#x92;s Fearlessis a dazzling action movie that transcends its breathless fight sequences with Huo's sportsmanship virtues, i.e., knowing when you've won by example, rather than by the fist. Jet Li is superb in the role.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004SIP88Y", "B000A2IPQY", "B003EVAG4C", "B0016MJ6JC", "B004U7MR0K", "B003INBNXO", "B0007Q6VXC", "B00003CXR4", "B001MEJY9Q", "B00008EY6M", "B001BEK8HO", "B00003CY5A", "B004I1AGTC", "B0009VBTQY", "B00005V1WW", "B005KK2FWG", "B004U7MR1O", "B000X1Z0C4", "B005FQ1OOK", "B000MRA592", "B000I0RNWU", "B005ZMBEXU", "B003DVB7F0", "B004P8R9O8", "B002XTXGA2", "B000JYW5BO", "B0030A6ICG", "B004GJYRKA", "B00005OOQ1", "B000MM0LEG", "B00HSJ2EMI", "B0051SFTGQ", "B002C6VMIY", "B008IG0B0C", "B000QGEB12", "B00005YUNV", "B001MEJY9G", "B000EE3FUY", "B00K2LC44M", "B004VW4V9E", "B004BZ5ADW", "B004XQO8MS", "B000GFLKDU", "B000ICLU7C", "B009VL2AZM", "B006C1S1DY", "B001L67A4G", "B00B6OEE7O", "B00284G2BC", "B00ET2ODYY", "B005E7SEZW", "B00104AYGK", "B00518HBAI", "B0055CP9EK", "B000W95QDK", "B00C3ALL9O", "0780619331", "B00FLCYIAA", "B009VL2A5M", "B006LOC01G", "B00518HB94", "B0000694WE", "B0015RCUR8", "B00EI3Y1QO", "B004I7F862", "B003E1QCYK", "B005NQ5LQ4", "B006MWA91A", "B001H5X6PI", "B000683VH0", "0783226985", "B00GXFZOYI", "B0056OZI0W", "B000050B7J", "B0035V35P8", "B0019PL2W0", "B00003CXGG", "B000HC2M3Y", "B008XEZXES", "B00441GYWO", "B0002O7XUE", "B000I2KOB0", "B0015RCUQO", "B0085A9J18", "B004SUDQAY", "B00005JMEW", "B005F96UGO", "B0010X741O", "B004H2CXBQ", "B00005JMUA", "B003LN0NXC", "B0060KGSGO", "B0018PH3NS", "B0056OZI0M", "B008WAM36O", "B005M9VSMI", "B00B1CGFD2", "B000FELD8Y", "B00005BJX9"], "bought_together": ["B004SIP88Y"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004GXKBGK", "B003INBNXO", "B004SIP88Y", "B001BEK8HO"]}, "price": 10.28, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 107058}, "asin": "B000K2UW06", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51qxHWcGBlL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Jet Li's Fearless (Unrated Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "First screened in Europe and scheduled for limited release in the U.S.,Bandidascan now be viewed by all fans of the visually stunning duo, Penelope Cruz and Salma Hayek. Set in Mexico 1888,Bandidasis a Western spoof about two women, Maria Alvarez (Penelope Cruz) and Sara Sandoval (Salma Hayek), who seek to avenge the tragedies befallen both their fathers under robber baron, Tyler Jackson (Dwight Yoakam). Jackson, employed by the Bank of New York, is sent to Mexico to buy land and open banks to the detriment of local culture. Jackson kills Sara's corrupt father, Don Diego, while bandits burn down Maria's home. The two ladies band together for the community's cause. Under the tutelage of Bill Buck (Sam Sheperd), Sara and Maria develop bank robbery skills. When criminologist, Quentin Cooke (Steve Zahn), hunts them, they convert him with their strong moral sense and good looks. Like anyThelma and Louise-ish tale of women who take charge, Maria and Sara are foil characters who eventually become an invincible, sisterly team. This comedy is built around their bickering. For Sara, with European education and penchant of designer clothing, Maria is a hick who lacks refinement, yet Maria, horse whisperer, can fire a gun. The slapstick is overkill, for example when Sara wonders whether a bandana is Gucci or Prada. However, viewers will love Penelope Cruz on horseback and the two actresses practice-kissing their foe in a brothel.Bandidasis a light film with some laughs and mucho sex appeal.  --Trinie DaltonBeyondBandidasMore Films from Salma HayekMore Films from Penelope CruzMore Comic WesternsStills fromBandidas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B005Z9MFWC", "B008LC8V1Y", "B000FIHN5M", "B0000A2ZU1", "B0000WN140", "B0007KZQAM", "B001OXLGJQ", "B00005LMAL", "B00005N91C", "B0000ZG0NQ", "B00005LZOD", "076780421X", "0767817710", "B000067J24", "B004SIP7S0", "B004P7CN5O", "B000085OXZ", "B0006J27WO", "B007P1PQUG", "B004QI14KW", "B00E8AVNAE", "B00AEFZ2DG", "B0000A2ZTY", "B000ASDFI6", "B000KX0HIW", "B0045HCIYA", "B00J49R1BY", "B0000X2EIS", "B005LAII94", "B002ZG98C8", "B00F3TDA6O", "B000F8O2QU", "B0019K4YT8", "B000BITVBA", "B0048LVDHG", "B00HEPC0TS", "B00005YUNT", "B003VADSJG", "B000U1ZV80", "B0001FVECM", "B000059H7K", "B00HRUQ8HK", "B000CEXGAU", "B002ZG98KK", "B002ZG984Q", "B00HW3LAF2", "B00BLN4V5A", "B002C4N66M", "B004LS6CNG", "B0050MB57U", "B00B6OEB18", "B00008CMSX", "B0010DM3R4", "B006OALDLA", "B00IKM5L6I", "B0048LVDGM", "B00EON8RHM", "B00IOFDJWY", "B000GIW9I2", "B00003L9BB", "B003NF97MQ", "B007C4ZJ0S", "B00016MSV2", "B0001CNRRU", "B001U0HB5Q", "B000KLQUSU", "B00APUAKYG", "B001AZW73M", "B0002S64TQ", "B000FAOCC2", "0783229402", "B00024JC30", "B00HOGBXS6", "B003Y5H5C4", "B000ARXF96", "B00DS79HD8", "B002U4UYZK", "B0007UDC80", "6305213283", "B000E8JO3C", "B000053VBV", "B003AWRMCE", "B00005JMWP", "B003YOZNBU", "B00JBGSHSQ", "B00E8G5H8W", "6305504024", "6304884400", "B000FUTVLY", "B006LOBZSA", "B002S5N052", "B00003CXXY", "B001MTYRKC", "B000Y7U94G", "B005LAII44", "B0002J4X2K", "B004A8ZWSS", "B00006ZXSI", "B0045HCIYU", "B00GSTHC7G"], "bought_together": ["B005Z9MFWC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005Z9MFWC", "B004SIP7S0", "B008LC8V1Y", "B000FIHN5M"]}, "price": 9.38, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 66506}, "asin": "B000K7VHNW", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Z7581WDEL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Bandidas"}
{"description": "The more things change, the more they stay the same? When it comes toAll in the Family, the answer is an unqualified yes&#x85; and no. Considering the show's tremendous popularity (this sixth season, spanning 1975 and '76, was the fifth straight year it held down the top spot in the Nielsen ratings), creator-producer Norman Lear was unlikely to make any drastic adjustments to the basic formula. And sure enough, in these 24 episodes (on three discs,sansbonus features), the four main characters--Archie Bunker (Carroll O'Connor, brilliant as ever), ditzy wife Edith (Jean Stapleton), daughter Gloria (Sally Struthers), and contentious son-in-law Mike Stivic (Rob Reiner)--and their relationships remain the obvious focal point. What's more, while it's true that various new developments, including Mike and Gloria's move next door (to the house once occupied by the Jeffersons), her pregnancy, and the birth of little Joey, are more than cosmetic and account for the lion's share of the storylines,All in the Family's basic dynamic remains one of the strongest and most instantly recognizable in TV sitcom history. Ditto the writers' penchant for the trenchant; social issues include tolerance and homophobia (Archie saves a woman's life with \"mouth-to-mouth restitution,\" only to discover that \"she\" is a transvestite), women's rights (Gloria gets fired for being pregnant), vigilantism (Archie fends off a mugger with illegal tear gas), religion (Archie wants his grandson baptized and raised as a Christian, but Mike has other ideas), and so on. And now more than ever, some of the language will seem a little shocking, as Archie regularly uses a variant of the gay slur that gotGrey's Anatomycast member Isaiah Washington in very hot water more than three decades later.Some changes, however, are a little more profound. The kinder, gentler Archie who began to appear a few seasons back is more in effect now; an extended and largely improvised scene in which he coddles his infant grandson is surprisingly tender, and when he hugs Mike after Joey is born, longtime viewers might wonder if what on earth has happened to TV's most unrepentant, close-minded bigot. But hey, even cavemen evolved, and the Archie Bunker we see in Season 6 bears an increasing resemblance to a character he most surely inspired, one who usually ends up removing his foot from his mouth long enough to do the right thing: Homer Simpson.--Sam Graham", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002E58FTC", "B002E58FTM", "B005KK2FTO", "B000TD2KY2", "B000TD0PHG", "B002E58FUG", "B002E58FTW", "B00465I13S", "B002E58FT2", "B000CCBCCG", "B000255LG6", "B000AMJG5I", "B00008R9MC", "B000G0O5JG", "B00GLT2SOA", "B0007OCG74", "B000068V9X", "B000MEYKAA", "B00DJYK1XU", "B00FM4S7P4", "B00I458456", "B00JDCP0QA", "B00096S480", "B0006IUDYY", "B000YGGNGK", "B0001NBNIY", "B0011N19HI", "B0008JIJ1K", "B0089BSLKS", "B000A9QKSM", "B000BOH8YQ", "B00BWQU0RY", "B009TTGLJ2", "B00H8KC1N4", "B002JH2EJM", "B000MGTQ6G", "B0002KE2FW", "B00G3BRC24", "B000B5XOTS", "6305957878", "B00005JLIC", "B000EXDS02", "B0007Y08JW", "B000A0GOQ4", "B002WN8IR0", "B004MWLXTY", "B001DSNEME", "B00023B1WQ", "B003VTKZ84", "B00007KK5J", "B0002NY8R6", "B000ERVJMM", "B000A0GOP0", "B00HW3L9MG", "B0014FAIYS", "B000H1RFXM", "B00D2UMHB0", "B0007WFXL2", "B00IXPWGIS", "B0000E32X2", "B0000BV1XX", "B001OXLGK0", "B0007WQHFS", "B0001O3YHQ", "B001HUHBD6", "B0001AVZDU", "B00I87U9H6", "B00HNGC56G", "B000HIVIOM", "B000PISZ86", "B00A2L1CJK", "B000DZ95IU", "B00IF0KASY", "B0002Y4T7O", "B002FLOTFO", "B0012EM5EC", "B001E6JC26", "B00FM4S8IU", "B000FA57U8", "B00IP965IO", "B00HQLZCIQ", "B000YKYT1M", "B006VC3L9S", "B0019F02W6", "B000EQ45BU", "B00I87U8UE", "B00IJZW35I", "B00093GVWY", "B000E6ES9Y", "B00008NV4G", "B000291Q3O", "B001DSNELU", "B005DCJ0Q0", "B0041SI7B6", "B00280QNKG", "B001LRTT30", "B0000B1A5A", "B0000AUXVS", "B000YGGNIS", "B001HUHBAY"], "bought_together": ["B002E58FTC", "B002E58FTM"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002E58FTC", "B002E58FTM", "B002E58FTW", "B002E58FUG"]}, "price": 24.98, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 245717}, "asin": "B000KX0IPY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51AsVVoR3mL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "All in the Family: Season 6"}
{"description": "Growing up can be a confusing journey fraught with difficult choices.  Boog (Martin Lawrence) is a domesticated Grizzly Bear who leads a perfectly happy life inside of Park Ranger Beth's (Debra Messing) garage, but a chance meeting with an overly energetic mule deer named Elliot (Ashton Kutcher) quickly changes everything and lands Boog high in the forest a few days before the opening of hunting season.  Devoid of even the most basic survival skills, Boog and Elliot stumble through the woods and find themselves at the mercy of every forest animal from skunks to chipmunks as well as an evil hunter named Shaw (Gary Sinise).  After unintentionally inciting and endangering an entire forest full of clever animals, Boog and Elliot come to the realization that only by banding together do the forest animals stand a chance of outsmarting the hunters and ensuring their own survival.This first animated film from Sony Pictures Animation takes its inspiration from cartoonist Steve Moore(In the Bleachers)and features animals with human-like intelligence, a vibrant color palate, and skilled animation that makes everything from the wind blowing Boo's fur to the animals' wild trip down the falls simply breathtaking.  While it doesn't quite live up toOver the Hedge,Open Seasonis an entertaining production that explores the difficult process of maturation, the universal need for acceptance, and the true value of friendship.  Special features include a 15-minute featurette about the animation process at Sony Pictures Animation and Image Works, a 7-minute look at the recording sessions featuring the voices behind the characters, two deleted scenes, three short animated cartoon strips, a short \"Boog and Elliot's Midnight Bun Run\" that's an extension of the trailer scene in the movie, art gallery, beat boards, humorous commentary from the animals' point of views, and a full length commentary by Producer Michelle Murdocca, Directors Roger Allers and Jill Culton, and others.  Activities include a \"Voice-A-Rama\" where viewers can hear specific lines spoken by alternate voices and a trivia \"Wheel of Fortune--Forest Edition\" as well as a DVD-ROM link to more online fun.

{"description": "Thematically ambitious and emotionally complex, Clint Eastwood'sFlags of Our Fathersis an intimate epic with much to say about war and the nature of heroism in America. Based on thenon-fiction bestsellerby James Bradley (with Ron Powers), and adapted byMillion Dollar Babyscreenwriter Paul Haggis (Jarheadscreenwriter William Broyles Jr. wrote an earlier draft that was abandoned when Eastwood signed on to direct), this isn't so much a conventional war movie as it is a thought-provoking meditation on our collective need for heroes, even at the expense of those we deem heroic. In telling the story of the six men (five Marines, one Navy medic) who raised the American flag of victory on the battle-ravaged Japanese island of Iwo Jima on February 23rd, 1945, Eastwood takes us deep into the horror of war (in painstakingly authentic Iwo Jima battle scenes) while emphasizing how three of the surviving flag-raisers (played by Adam Beach, Ryan Phillippe, and Jesse Bradford) became reluctant celebrities &#x96; and resentful pawns in a wartime publicity campaign &#x96; after their flag-raising was immortalized by Associated Press photographer Joe Rosenthal in the most famous photograph in military history.As the surviving flag-raisers reluctantly play their public roles as \"the heroes of Iwo Jima\" during an exhausting (but clearly necessary) wartime bond rally tour,Flags of Our Fathersevolves into a pointed study of battlefield valor and misplaced idolatry, incorporating subtle comment on the bogus nature of celebrity, the trauma of battle, and the true meaning of heroism in wartime. Wisely avoiding any direct parallels to contemporary history, Eastwood allows us to draw our own conclusions about the Iwo Jima flag-raisers and how their postwar histories (both noble and tragic) simultaneously illustrate the hazards of exploited celebrity and society's genuine need for admirable role models during times of national crisis.Flags of Our Fathersdefies the expectations of those seeking a more straightforward war-action drama, but it's richly satisfying, impeccably crafted film that manages to be genuinely patriotic (in celebrating the camaraderie of soldiers in battle) while dramatizing the ultimate futility of war. Eastwood's follow-up film,Letters from Iwo Jima, examines the Iwo Jima conflict from the Japanese perspective.--Jeff ShannonBeyondFlags of Our FathersOther World War II DVDsEssential DVDs by Director Clint EastwoodFlags of Our Fathersby James BradleyStills fromFlags of Our Fathers(click for larger image)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JPKE", "B00555ZTRY", "B000SK5Z2A", "B00AEBBA36", "B000AAF27G", "B001DSNEJM", "B00D3LA63Y", "B001IBIHQ4", "B00AEBB8QK", "B00001ZWUS", "B000F5WR4W", "B00AEBB9UU", "B00004X13T", "B00005JK8K", "B00005PJ8T", "B00C2R11Y8", "B0021L8V2A", "B004U7MQWY", "B0002WT4OE", "B000009RBL", "B00979KQD6", "B00HF98SHG", "B0015D20FE", "B000F4PDF8", "B004SIP9X8", "B00006CXSS", "B00003CXTG", "B004GJYRA0", "B003AT9D74", "0553384155", "B0071HPP3M", "B000065U1N", "B00AEFXVCU", "0553111337", "B0002V7ON8", "0792839730", "B000095WW8", "B003ASLJOU", "B001LXIDWM", "B000NTPG7A", "B0002ISG9W", "B000LAZE8C", "B000P0J09C", "B000EHSVS2", "B00005PJ8S", "B00B0U2SFE", "B008XJ0J8I", "B00275EGWY", "B000DZIGDU", "B00K2CHX9C", "B00005JKTP", "0440229200", "B00AEFXRRO", "B00AEBB86U", "B000EHSVSC", "B005LAIGYQ", "B0007TKNM4", "B0007TKNGA", "B00004XPPG", "B003ASLJO0", "B00003CXHJ", "B001TUZG4K", "B001FB55L2", "B005GYSV4M", "B00AEFXVOI", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00AZNEW5G", "B00L4K450G", "B00096S4B2", "B00008K76U", "B003ELKNH2", "B003ASLJMW", "B00005JA9F", "B00004XPPC", "B00BL9MOPS", "B000FJGWBC", "B00HEPE6MM", "0767802470", "B000FVQLRA", "B002T9H2LA", "B00005N5S3", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B002O3Z510", "B00005OSJQ", "B005LAIGN2", "B003AWRMA6", "B000P0J0EW", "B002O3Z4WU", "B00J11U54K", "079284646X", "B000ELL1R6", "B007S0DCUU", "B002O3Z4Z2", "B00DL48BM6", "B00096S4BM", "0792841409", "B003ASLJPE", "B0007TKNLA", "0792838408", "B00AEFYENK"], "bought_together": ["B00005JPKE", "B00AEBBA36"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00001ZWUS", "B00006CXSS", "B00005JPKE", "B000P1XITE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 11870}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.88, "brand": "Paramount Home Video", "asin": "B000M4RG42", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51w01CgEgRL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Flags of Our Fathers (Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "Brilliantly conceived, superbly directed, and beautifully acted,Babelis inarguably one of the best films of 2006. Director Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu and his co-writer, Guillermo Arriaga (the two also collaborated onAmores Perrosand21 Grams) weave together the disparate strands of their story into a finely hewn fabric by focusing on what appear to be several equally incongruent characters: an American (Brad Pitt) touring Morocco with his wife (Cate Blanchett) become the focus of an international incident also involving a hardscrabble Moroccan farmer (Mustapha Rachidi) struggling to keep his two young sons in line and his family together. A San Diego nanny (Adriana Barraza), her employers absent, makes the disastrous decision to take their kids with her to a wedding in Mexico. And a deaf-mute Japanese teen (the extraordinary Rinko Kikuchi) deals with a relationship with her father (Koji Yakusho) and the world in general that's been upended by the death of her mother. It is perhaps not surprising, or particularly original, that a gun is the device that ties these people together. YetBabelisn't merely about violence and its tragic consequences. It's about communication, and especially the lack of it--both intercultural, raising issues like terrorism and immigration, and intracultural, as basic as husbands talking to their wives and parents understanding their children. I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu's command of his medium, sound and visual alike, is extraordinary; the camera work is by turns kinetic and restrained, the music always well matched to the scenes, the editing deft but not confusing, and the film (which clocks in at a lengthy 143 minutes) is filled with indelible moments. Many of those moments are also pretty stark and grim, and no will claim that all of this leads to a \"happy\" ending, but there is a sense of reconciliation, perhaps even resolution. \"If You Want to be Understood... Listen,\" goes the tagline. And if you want a movie that will leave you thinking,Babelis it.--Sam GrahamBeyondBabelOther Interweaving Storylines on DVDOther DVDs by Director Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rrituWhy We Love Cate BlanchettStills fromBabel(click for larger image)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0001CNRRU", "B00005N8A9", "B0041KKYF6", "B000A3XY5A", "B000F7CMRM", "B000067IZ3", "B00005JL57", "B00AEFXESQ", "B001P9KR8U", "B000N6TX1I", "B001JIE7JC", "B00005JPKE", "B00AEFXQ9S", "B00005JMJ4", "B0010DR4BO", "B000NIVJF4", "B000NIVJFY", "B000F1IQN2", "B00HF98SPS", "B0045ZAQRS", "B00011CZRE", "B000N3T0DW", "B002O3Z4Z2", "B000MZHW40", "B004SIP6VI", "B0034G4P30", "B008JFUNKU", "B003ASLJQS", "B000E1NXJ0", "B004SIP6GI", "B00AEBB89W", "B00275EGWY", "B000IONJM4", "B00H9KKGTO", "B00003CWTI", "B00080Z53O", "B00005JNCZ", "B00114XTHA", "B00GUO2SKA", "B00112S8RS", "B001PPLJIQ", "B000MXPE7O", "B00102F5WK", "B00121QGPY", "B0016Q2D66", "B002J1RZHE", "B008220DGE", "B000O76ZQC", "B0013XZ6X4", "B00080ZG10", "B00337KM2S", "B000286RP2", "B004SIP8ZM", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00005JMJG", "B00005Q4CS", "B00AEBB9CS", "B00G4Q3KOC", "B0036TGSJE", "B001TOD92C", "B000OY8NBK", "B004XVMCKS", "B00GMV8M2Y", "B00005JLRE", "B00005JH9M", "B00004WG2F", "B00AEBB8SS", "B00005JKJA", "B00H9HZITU", "B000YENUI6", "B0041KKYDI", "B001MZ5W3M", "B000N3SU92", "B000EQHXNW", "B0041KKYEM", "B001LLH8SE", "B0007TKOAA", "B000P0J0BK", "B002S5N052", "B004SIP7S0", "B00AEBB8NI", "B002SJIO4A", "B000CQLZ0Q", "B000E33VWW", "B000M341QE", "B002VWNICC", "B001NFNFNU", "6305313687", "B00005JKTF", "B00FZ4KR4U", "B00008K7AO", "B00DL48BM6", "079073639X", "B00H83EUQW", "B000FVQLRA", "B0002TT0MI", "B00AHTYI5M", "B00H9L26AA", "B00003CWRX", "B002FHGESI"], "bought_together": ["B00005N8A9", "B0041KKYF6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000A3XY5A", "B0001CNRRU", "B0041KKYF6", "B00G4Q3KOC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 100262}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.22, "brand": "Paramount Home Video", "asin": "B000MCH5P4", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51poif023LL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Babel"}
{"description": "It takes a certain kind of comic genius to create a character who is, to quote the classic Sondheim lyric, appealing and appalling. But be forewarned:Boratis not \"something for everyone.\" It arrives as advertised as one of the most outrageous, most offensive, and funniest films in years. Kazakhstan journalist Borat Sagdiyev (Sacha Baron Cohen reprising the popular character from hisDa Ali G Show), leaves his humble village to come to \"U.S. and A\" to film a documentary. After catching an episode ofBaywatchin his New York hotel room, he impulsively scuttles his plans and, accompanied by his fat,hirsute producer (Hardy to his Laurel), proceeds to California to pursue the object of his obsession, Pamela Anderson.Boratis not about how he finds America; it's about how America finds him in a series of increasingly cringe-worthy scenes. Borat, with his '70s mustache, well-worn grey suit, and outrageously backwards attitudes (especially where Jews are concerned) interacts with a cross-section of the populace, catching them, a la Alan Funt onCandid Camera, in the act of being themselves. Early on, an unwitting humor coach advises Borat about various types of jokes. Borat asks if his brother's retardation is a ripe subject for comedy. The coach patiently replies, \"That would not be funny in America.\" NOT! Borat is subversively, bracingly funny. When it comes to exploring uncharted territory of what is and is not appropriate or politically correct, Borat knows no boundaries, as when he brings a fancy dinner with the southern gentry to a halt after returning from the bathroom with a bag of his feces (\"The cultural differences are vast,\" his hostess graciously/patronizingly offers), or turns cheers to boos at a rodeo when he calls for bloodlust against the Iraqis and mangles \"The Star Spangled Banner.\"Success, John F. Kennedy once said, has a thousand fathers. A paternity test onBoratmight reveal traces of Bill Dana's Jose Jimenez, Andy Kaufman, Michael Moore,The Jamie Kennedy Xperiment, andJackass. Some scenes seem to have been staged (a game Anderson, whom Borat confronts at a book signing, was reportedly in on the setup), but others, as the growing litany of lawsuits attests, were not. All too real is Borat's encounter with loutish Southern frat boys who reveal their sexism and racism, and the disturbing moment when he asks a gun store owner what gun he would recommend to \"kill a Jew\" (a Glock automatic is the matter-of-fact reply). Comedy is not pretty, and inBoratit can get downright ugly, as when Borat and his producer get jiggly with it during a nude fight that spills out from their hotel room into the hallway, elevator, lobby and finally, a mortgage brokers association banquet. High-five! --Donald LiebensonOn the DVD\"Global Visitings\" capturesBorat-mania in all its hype and glory, as Sacha Baron Cohen, never breaking character, promotes his film around the world. On the itinerary isLate Night with Conan O'Brienand the Toronto Film Festival, a now-legendary screening aborted after a projector malfunction. A mixed bag of deleted scenes finds Borat trying to bait more unsuspecting citizens, including an animal-control worker who refuses Borat a dog after he asks, \"How do you recommend I cook this?\" and a doctor who is nonplussed by Borat's obscene medical history. A supermarket visit offers the most maddening fromage-inspired looniness since Monty Python's \"Cheese Shop\" sketch. Also good for a few chuckles are a faux soundtrack commercial and aBaywatchparody (\"Sexydangerwatch\").--Donald LiebensonBeyondBoratAll things Sacha Baron CohenBoratApparelBoratSoundtrackStills fromBorat(click for larger image)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002P7UCJ0", "B005LAIHGI", "B0002ZMITY", "B002OID4WM", "B00020X852", "B000A88ESW", "B000WZEZGI", "B001G5T6GW", "B005LAIHHC", "B00AEFZ8OY", "B002P7UCJA", "B00005JNZU", "B001DPHDB0", "B001J9KJ4I", "B00G2P79BU", "B000J4QW8Q", "B00AEFYS2M", "B00005JMYI", "B002Q4VBPQ", "B0006GANPA", "B001OD4S50", "6305922756", "B003XJABTK", "B00AEBBA2C", "B008R65XNS", "B000BKVQS4", "B00AEBB9K0", "B003CRM6PA", "B000A7DVR2", "B00AEBB8FQ", "B0016MOV92", "B000BKJ762", "B00009W5CA", "B000AP04L0", "B008220BGQ", "B002T9H2LA", "B00068WOH8", "0385523467", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00008975Z", "B004SIP95G", "B00003CXZ1", "0783229526", "B002ZG99N6", "B003VPX5Y4", "B002SJIO4A", "B00005JLQN", "B00AEFY854", "B00005O3VC", "B004XVMCH6", "B000K7VHQE", "B0006HBZEW", "B00005JMUA", "B000VE439Y", "B00AEFXDO6", "B000EMGJAO", "B0000A02TZ", "B00005JNBQ", "B003Y5H5B0", "B00BEIYMZ6", "B004SIP8ZM", "B000MCH5RM", "B000K7VHOG", "B00005ALS0", "B001UV4X8S", "B00009MGEM", "B0001Z4OXS", "B000C20VPA", "B0012IWNZY", "B00CE00ZV8", "B00005QCVX", "B000I0RNVQ", "B000022TSW", "B001TOD92C", "B000P0J09M", "B00005JL78", "B00AEFYAMA", "B00AEFXGIY", "B000J4P9P8", "B000055Y0X", "B004EPZ084", "B001VLBDD0", "B00AEFY5B6", "B006XZWAWM", "B00005JKMN", "B00AEFY0F2", "B000XFVIOO", "B002GSXKOW", "B00006G8HR", "B000HT386M", "B000MQCUJG", "B00007AJF7", "B00005KA6V", "B004SIP9MY", "B00AEBBA72", "B00018D42W", "B000TZJBPQ", "B0009HBPN0", "B004P9UWM8"], "bought_together": ["B005LAIHGI", "B002P7UCJ0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005LAIHGI", "B000WZEZGI", "B002OID4WM", "B000TZJBPQ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 15271}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.29, "brand": "COHEN,SACHA BARON", "asin": "B000MMMT9G", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51uGbGa68JL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan"}
